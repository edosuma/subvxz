WEBVTT

00:10.444 --> 00:11.445
(sighs)

00:11.512 --> 00:13.314
Why the hell did you think
I'd like scrapbooking?

00:13.381 --> 00:14.315
It's just a humiliating

00:14.382 --> 00:15.949
reminder that we haven't

00:16.016 --> 00:17.285
done anything with our lives.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.619
I want us to have
a hobby together.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.688
The cute wrinkly couple
I met said scrapbooking

00:20.754 --> 00:22.756
was the key to their
50-year marriage.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.393
That's because they work
in a scrapbooking store.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.760
If they ran a liquor store,

00:26.827 --> 00:29.230
they'd say drinking was
the secret to their marriage.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.764
Wilfrid and I tried that.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.133
I mean, we fought a lot,

00:32.200 --> 00:33.901
spent a couple of nights
in jail,

00:33.967 --> 00:36.003
but once he got
cirrhosis of the liver,

00:36.070 --> 00:37.838
it really brought us together.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.107
We could do that.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.409
Let's keep looking.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.778
Well, I made a ship
and a bottle.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.817
It's ship in a bottle.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.458
Get...
(sighs)

00:57.525 --> 01:04.565
* You light up my life... *

01:04.632 --> 01:06.234
See?

01:06.300 --> 01:09.303
I told you you'd get the
hang of cross-stitching.

01:16.944 --> 01:17.878
(farts)

01:17.945 --> 01:18.912
(groans)

01:18.979 --> 01:20.148
That's five, Virginia!

01:20.214 --> 01:21.182
I'm done.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.516
I don't know
what it is!

01:22.583 --> 01:25.519
I'm the same way
with Chinese food!

01:25.586 --> 01:28.689
Hate it, hate it,
hate it, hate it!

01:30.158 --> 01:31.825
* Whoo! *

01:31.892 --> 01:36.364
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:41.902 --> 01:43.437
(sighs softly)

01:43.504 --> 01:45.206
Now what?

01:45.273 --> 01:48.842
We wait for
it to grow.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.744
This sucks.

01:50.811 --> 01:51.779
(door closes)

01:51.845 --> 01:53.481
Well, I waited a year and a half

01:53.547 --> 01:54.982
for Sabrina
to break up with Wyatt,

01:55.048 --> 01:58.219
and this morning, I find out
they're moving in together.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.753
I guess it's time to give up.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.322
Good thinking.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.191
I'm sure there's another girl
you can admire from afar

02:03.257 --> 02:04.425
and never make a move on.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.627
How about that redhead
at the dry cleaners?

02:06.694 --> 02:08.829
She's got a boyfriend.
What the hell's the
matter with you two?

02:08.896 --> 02:10.231
They're getting married.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.099
You need to step up your game.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.068
Whatever you do, be sure you
keep a piece of Sabrina's hair.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.037
The way technology's moving,
in a couple of years,

02:17.104 --> 02:19.573
you'll be able to grow
your very own Sabrina from it.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.775
VIRGINIA:
Hey, Sabrina, it's Virginia.

02:21.842 --> 02:22.810
How you doing?

02:22.876 --> 02:23.977
No! What are you doing?!

02:24.044 --> 02:25.246
(scowls):
Contain him.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.314
Have you seen Jimmy?

02:26.380 --> 02:28.349
He's out on a date
with his girlfriend

02:28.416 --> 02:30.851
and he's not answering his cell.

02:30.918 --> 02:35.022
Oh, yeah, they've been
on four or five dates now.

02:35.088 --> 02:39.193
Mm-hmm, he's just real private
about that stuff.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.594
(grunts)

02:40.661 --> 02:44.765
Anyway, he's been making
tons of intercourse,

02:44.832 --> 02:48.001
so if you see him, just tell him
to call his mother.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.670
Well, I got to go do something

02:49.737 --> 02:51.639
that won't allow me
to talk longer. Take care!

02:51.705 --> 02:52.806
(grunting)

02:52.873 --> 02:54.275
Guess what?

02:54.342 --> 02:56.009
Mama just kicked you up a notch.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.478
Dial it back, baby.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.879
You're choking him out.

02:58.946 --> 03:03.351
Having another girl
makes you more desirable.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.953
Your father was a
tobacco-chewing jackass

03:06.019 --> 03:07.321
on a minibike when we met.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.390
Half the reason
I liked him was because

03:09.457 --> 03:11.259
somebody else had him.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.760
You know what
the other half was?

03:12.826 --> 03:13.894
I'm such a good kisser.

03:13.961 --> 03:17.498
If I had my own martial art,
it'd be called tongue-fu.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.966
Burt, please don't
ruin that for me.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.969
Look, if Sabrina
seems happy and says

03:22.035 --> 03:24.037
"congrats on the girlfriend,"
she doesn't like you.

03:24.104 --> 03:27.875
But if she seems a little
snippy, you got her on the hook.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.043
If that doesn't work,
you could just try guys.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.546
Dad, I'm not gay.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.214
You're not gonna get the guy.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.684
Just gonna pine for him
and waste all our time.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.528
Hey, Casanova.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.196
I hear you have
a lady-friend.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.864
Does she have
any older sisters?

03:50.931 --> 03:51.899
A mother?

03:51.965 --> 03:53.434
Grandmothers who've
taken care of themselves?

03:53.501 --> 03:55.303
The girlfriend was a stupid lie
my mom said

03:55.369 --> 03:56.637
just to make Sabrina jealous.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.506
Well, I think
your mother's idea is working.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.541
Score one for
hot-ass Virginia.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.609
What do you mean it's working?

04:01.675 --> 04:02.676
D-Does Sabrina seem jealous?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.177
Would you say she was snippy?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.779
It's hard to say.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.115
Everyone's snippy with me;
I'm Frank.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.350
I mean about the girlfriend.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.318
Was she snippy
about the girlfriend thing?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.785
See what I mean?

04:11.852 --> 04:15.356
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.457
Where's mystery lady?

04:16.524 --> 04:17.991
Is there something to hide?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.226
She a little plump?

04:19.293 --> 04:20.728
She a little plumpy
in the dumpy?

04:20.794 --> 04:21.795
No.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.731
Funny you should
ask, Sabrina,

04:23.797 --> 04:25.899
because she was just here,
and she was gorgeous.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.768
So I missed her?

04:27.835 --> 04:28.869
What's she like?

04:30.338 --> 04:31.339
Athletic build,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.441
shorts and a tank top.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.742
Braided hair,

04:34.808 --> 04:37.345
weapons and gear
you'd need for tomb-raiding.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.012
You're describing Lara Croft.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.350
I am not familiar
with that film or video game.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.251
Frank didn't actually meet her.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.586
Well, I should meet her.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.388
Maybe we should go on
a little double date.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.889
You, me, Wyatt,

04:48.956 --> 04:49.823
Bucktooth McBig-Butt.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.058
(chuckles):
I'm just kidding.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.225
I'm sure she's lovely.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.861
I don't know.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.296
She's only off Mondays
and I work Mondays.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.366
I can take your shift.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.900
Great. It's a date.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.438
Frank, what
the hell, man?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.607
It wasn't me, Jimmy,
it's the disease.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.576
You know I'm a workaholic.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.015
(groans)

05:15.082 --> 05:16.384
Way to go!

05:16.450 --> 05:17.718
Now we have to find me
a fake girlfriend,

05:17.785 --> 05:19.553
and I think she has to look
like Lara Croft.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.254
Who?
Angela Jolly.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.590
(screams)

05:23.457 --> 05:25.125
I hate this!

05:25.192 --> 05:27.528
(groaning)

05:35.769 --> 05:37.705
This hobby would be
a lot more fun

05:37.771 --> 05:39.973
if we could afford
two helicopters.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.341
I hate this.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.744
I feel like I'm tangled
in a dirty web of lies.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.447
Don't think of it
as a dirty web of lies,

05:46.514 --> 05:49.116
think of it
as a warm cocoon of lies.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.453
We just need to find someone to
pretend to be your girlfriend.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.021
Oh, what about
your cousin Alyssa?

05:54.087 --> 05:54.822
She's 14.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.989
She's a tall 14.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.726
Burt, stop strafing Maw Maw.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.828
It's boring without
a little combat.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.762
She likes it.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.797
Can we focus on this
double date, please?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.566
Because I'm gonna
lose Sabrina forever

06:05.633 --> 06:07.868
if I can't find a fake
girlfriend for Valentine's Day.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.903
James, James!

06:09.970 --> 06:13.574
I was on the elliptical, and as
soon as my heart rate hit 150,

06:13.641 --> 06:14.775
the solution
to your problem

06:14.842 --> 06:17.110
shot into my head like
a flash of genius!

06:17.177 --> 06:18.178
(groaning)

06:18.245 --> 06:19.513
Cramp!

06:19.580 --> 06:20.380
What?! What's the solution?!

06:20.448 --> 06:21.415
Banana!

06:21.482 --> 06:24.184
Get me a banana!

06:24.251 --> 06:25.486
(gasps)

06:34.895 --> 06:37.498
This is the improv group
I've been taking classes with.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.732
Keeps me young.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.767
Plus, there's Alzheimer's
in my family,

06:39.833 --> 06:41.535
so I have to keep
exercising my noodle.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.070
Like right there, I said
"noodle" instead of "brain."

06:43.136 --> 06:44.137
Always working.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.139
BURT: Look at them
spazzing out up there.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.476
That's exactly what
my remedial math class was like.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.410
Freeze!

06:50.478 --> 06:51.512
Whoa.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.846
The actors have to
make up a scene

06:52.913 --> 06:54.648
based on whatever
random position

06:54.715 --> 06:55.783
they find themselves in.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.750
(grunts)

06:56.817 --> 06:57.818
Ooh!

06:57.885 --> 06:59.019
Oh, I'm reeling in
a big one here! Ooh!

06:59.953 --> 07:01.221
No way!

07:01.288 --> 07:02.890
He just made that up?

07:04.024 --> 07:04.958
Thanks, Ed.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.226
You ruined my day.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.094
(Burt and Virginia laugh)

07:07.160 --> 07:09.229
That fish knew his name!

07:09.296 --> 07:10.197
Move.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.901
I think Mary-Louise would make

07:13.967 --> 07:15.503
the perfect fake girlfriend
for James.

07:16.870 --> 07:17.871
She's an
amazing actress

07:17.938 --> 07:19.607
who's been on Broadway--
the street.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.209
And while she was there,
she saw a lot of great shows.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.445
So, Barney says
you're going to pay me

07:25.513 --> 07:27.247
to act like
your pretend girlfriend.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.415
Here's my head shot.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.750
Check out my special skills.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.352
I can juggle,
speak some Spanish, stage-fight,

07:32.419 --> 07:33.386
rollerblade...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.556
(scatting)

07:35.623 --> 07:37.457
* Whoo, whoo, whoo! *

07:37.525 --> 07:38.859
I also scat.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.027
Uh, yeah.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.596
Um, Barney (clears throat)
made it seem like

07:42.663 --> 07:44.665
I was more sure
of this than I am.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.734
I'm not even positive we can
pull off a lie like this.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.504
Yeah, well, I guess
it can be risky.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.673
But I don't get why you need
a fake girlfriend.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.575
You're sweet, tall,

07:54.642 --> 07:55.943
great nose.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.310
You like my nose?
'Cause a lot of people

07:57.377 --> 07:58.946
seem to make fun of it.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.447
That's 'cause there's
nothing else to make fun of.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.815
I mean, there's some size on it,

08:01.882 --> 08:04.017
but what girl doesn't like
a little size?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.553
(both chuckle)

08:05.619 --> 08:06.654
Okay, I'm being bad.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.188
How about this?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.924
A nose like that probably likes
to stop and smell the roses.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.726
I do like to smell the roses.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.394
I work in yards a lot.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.897
Yeah, I can tell
you work outdoors.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.599
You're well-built and ruddy.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.034
How about we forget
the fake girlfriend thing

08:21.101 --> 08:22.069
and you just ask me out?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.738
Unless you don't like
my body or something.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.840
No.
It's a great body.

08:26.907 --> 08:27.941
You should feel my stomach.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.145
Like that?

08:32.212 --> 08:33.446
It's very firm.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.315
That's not all that's firm.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.885
Move your hand
around to my--

08:37.951 --> 08:39.587
And scene!

08:39.653 --> 08:41.388
Had you going,
didn't I, puppy?

08:41.454 --> 08:42.790
So, now are you
less nervous

08:42.856 --> 08:44.592
about whether we can
pull this off?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.159
I guess.
(clears throat)

08:46.226 --> 08:48.862
Uh, just to be clear,
does the real you

08:48.929 --> 08:52.299
think I look well-
built and ruddy?

08:52.365 --> 08:53.867
Ruddy.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.773
Freeze!

09:00.974 --> 09:02.175
Virginia, start the scene.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.510
Uh...

09:03.577 --> 09:06.346
Oh! I'm reeling in a big one.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.615
Uh-huh.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.717
(chuckles nervously)

09:09.783 --> 09:11.484
Uh, nice to meet you.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.321
I'm an astronaut
walking on the moon.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.623
No, no!

09:15.689 --> 09:17.357
I'm the fish's mother.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.859
Give me back my son!

09:18.926 --> 09:20.761
Okay, I'm gonna let you go.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.631
But now I'm gonna
eat you instead.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.600
(laughing)

09:26.667 --> 09:28.135
(laughing)

09:28.201 --> 09:29.603
You're good at this.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.104
We both are.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.172
Burt!

09:32.239 --> 09:33.741
Virginia!

09:34.541 --> 09:35.542
We found our hobby.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.977
Whoo!

09:37.044 --> 09:38.979
(both laughing)

09:39.046 --> 09:42.282
Okay, Jimmy and Mary-Louise,
you'll be yourselves.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.751
Virginia, you'll be Wyatt.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.418
That bag of chips
will be Sabrina.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.320
And I am a French waiter.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.689
And go!

09:48.756 --> 09:50.257
(French accent):
You are all so stupid!

09:50.323 --> 09:52.159
(deep voice): I'm Wyatt.
I kind of have the hots

09:52.225 --> 09:53.493
for this French waiter
over here.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.662
(chuckles)

09:54.728 --> 09:55.696
I wonder if he'll teach me

09:55.763 --> 09:57.230
his national kiss.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.365
Guys, this is fun,

09:58.431 --> 10:01.368
but I don't want to spend
all our time role-playing.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.203
Ah, Americans!

10:03.270 --> 10:04.838
So busy, busy, busy!

10:04.905 --> 10:05.839
Life should
be enjoyed

10:05.906 --> 10:08.241
slowly, like a fine aged cheese.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.176
Ooh-la-la!

10:09.242 --> 10:10.678
Can we just get
the facts straight about

10:10.744 --> 10:11.879
this fake
relationship?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.881
Yeah, I think we need
a good meet-cute.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.616
Huh?
A sweet story of
the cute way we met.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.185
Well, we're never gonna beat
how I met Sabrina.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.287
I was rolling a grocery basket
with a prison baby,

10:20.353 --> 10:22.455
and she kind of thought
I was a kidnapper pedophile.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.624
(snickers)
Or say you saved
my cat from a tree.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.160
Oh, but cats hate me,
and I'm bad with trees.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.161
Sabrina knows this.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.930
M-Maybe we should not
do this date.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.332
I'm going to slap you
if you don't stop panicking!

10:32.399 --> 10:33.033
It's gonna blow up!

10:33.100 --> 10:34.501
She's gonna find out I lied,

10:34.567 --> 10:35.869
and then I'm not
gonna see her again

10:35.936 --> 10:37.037
until she's Mrs. Wyatt Gill.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.906
Wyatt Gill?
Yeah.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.941
He's the guy we're
stealing a girl from?

10:41.008 --> 10:42.810
We grew up right down the
street from each other.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.912
Our families are good friends.
If we're hurting Wyatt,

10:44.978 --> 10:45.879
I've got to tell him.
No!

10:45.946 --> 10:47.380
I knew it.
Whoa, Nelly!

10:47.447 --> 10:49.683
Oh, crap. It's over.
No, it's not over, Jimmy.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.451
We'll just find you
a new fake girlfriend.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.420
Well, you'd better do it fast,
because I'm going to tell him.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.722
The hell you are!

10:54.788 --> 10:55.622
Burt, grab some rope.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.190
(grunts)

10:57.257 --> 10:58.325
Will you let go of me?!

10:58.391 --> 11:00.060
Mom!
(grunting)

11:00.127 --> 11:01.261
We'll just tie her
up and keep her

11:01.328 --> 11:02.629
in the garage till after
the double date!

11:02.696 --> 11:04.064
MARY-LOUISE:
Are you insane?!

11:04.131 --> 11:05.098
Let go of her!

11:05.165 --> 11:06.900
Jimmy, you want to be
a single father

11:06.967 --> 11:08.435
for the rest
of your life?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.302
Mom...

11:09.369 --> 11:10.738
BOTH: And... scene!

11:12.305 --> 11:13.841
Mary-Louise and I
figured that out

11:13.907 --> 11:15.776
while you two were
inside getting beers.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.444
BURT:
I got it!

11:17.510 --> 11:19.112
Okay, got ya!

11:19.179 --> 11:21.982
If we're gonna do this,
each of us has to tie a knot

11:22.049 --> 11:24.017
'cause I'm not taking the rap
for this alone.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.026
Sorry we're late.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.095
Romeo here filled a bathtub
with champagne and rose petals,

11:35.162 --> 11:39.800
and when I got in,
he insisted on drawing me.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.934
Thank you.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.974
Wyatt.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.910
Oh, come on!

11:49.977 --> 11:52.445
I haven't seen someone handle
the puck that bad

11:52.512 --> 11:54.481
since Pedro on the
Real World: San Francisco.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.416
Jimmy and I had a talk
about us committing

11:56.483 --> 11:58.585
to always being fully present
when we're together.

11:58.651 --> 11:59.987
We talked about that, too.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.155
But the TV was on,
so who knows what he heard.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.192
I gotta tinkle.
Order me a beer.
Low carb.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.761
"Tinkle" my foot. He's sneaking

12:07.828 --> 12:09.062
to the bar to watch the game.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.898
I'm just so glad
the only sport

12:10.964 --> 12:12.766
Jimmy's interested in
is scoring with me!

12:12.833 --> 12:14.001
And... scene.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.769
Oh, my God,
this is actually working.

12:15.836 --> 12:16.970
I can't believe this.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.438
Me, neither. I totally lied.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.506
I'm not really an actress.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.573
What?

12:20.640 --> 12:22.009
And scene within a scene.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.210
Got you again.
That's how good I am.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.678
Hey, that's the guy
from your improv group.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.049
Yeah. That's why I chose this
place. A lot of us work here.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.618
They're all going to help
make you look good.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.820
What? No,
I don't think we...

12:32.886 --> 12:34.988
WYATT: Big deal.
I was checking out the game.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.858
Not like I was checking
out the waitress... much.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.828
I'm just kidding.
She has fat ankles.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.797
(Falvey clears throat)

12:43.864 --> 12:47.200
The gentleman pre-requested
a serenade for the lovely lady.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.004
(playing "Greensleeves")

12:52.372 --> 12:54.007
How did you know
"Greensleeves" was

12:54.074 --> 12:55.909
my favorite classical selection?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.045
Did you call my mom and ask

12:58.111 --> 12:59.412
about my various likes
and dislikes?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.514
That would explain it.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.117
MARY-LOUISE:
Oh...

13:19.599 --> 13:20.868
(snaps fingers)

13:21.869 --> 13:23.270
(groans)

13:23.336 --> 13:25.005
(chuckles)

13:29.877 --> 13:32.145
Do you mind if we dance
with your dates?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.686
Uh, yeah, we kind of mind.

13:39.752 --> 13:43.957
You guys think you can just come
here and dance with our girls?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.893
Unless you can dance better.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.896
* *

13:51.098 --> 13:54.167
FALVEY: Ha-ha! Ay! Arriba!

13:56.269 --> 13:57.470
(slurping)

13:59.172 --> 14:01.708
It was scary, amazing,
wonderful.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.377
I can't believe it worked.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.746
Oh. Thanks, Maw Maw.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.714
(gasps)

14:07.780 --> 14:09.016
I'm telling you, honey,

14:09.082 --> 14:11.818
trust in the warm lie-cocoon,

14:11.885 --> 14:14.721
and soon enough, love's gonna
come knocking on the door.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.490
SABRINA: Hello?
Or just come walking in
like it lives here.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.026
Hey, what's up?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.962
I just wanted
to bring over the picture

14:22.029 --> 14:23.931
the waiter took of all
of us last night.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.766
Thought you and Mary-Louise
might want it more than I do.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.368
Yeah, thanks.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.104
So how about you and Wyatt?
Did you guys find an apartment?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.373
Oh, there is no me and Wyatt.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.508
We broke up last night.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.876
(whoops)

14:36.944 --> 14:39.046
(coughs)

14:39.112 --> 14:41.448
Choking on my pork-flavored
Bro-gurt,

14:41.514 --> 14:43.250
which is yogurt that comes in
man flavors like...

14:43.316 --> 14:44.717
Not the time, Burt.
You were saying...?

14:44.784 --> 14:45.919
Yeah, there was something

14:45.986 --> 14:47.955
about seeing how happy

14:48.021 --> 14:49.256
you and Mary-Louise made
each other

14:49.322 --> 14:50.857
just made me realize I deserved

14:50.924 --> 14:53.026
to feel that way
with somebody, too.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.661
So, I finally broke it off
with Wyatt.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.862
That's... that's wild.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.464
Yep.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.600
Now, here I am, single
on Valentine's Day. (chuckles)

15:00.667 --> 15:02.835
Too bad you've got
a girlfriend now, huh?

15:02.902 --> 15:03.836
That's...

15:03.903 --> 15:05.538
But I'm just gonna go home

15:05.605 --> 15:07.774
and change
my relationship status

15:07.840 --> 15:10.110
to "single" and spend
the next 12 hours responding

15:10.177 --> 15:12.179
to "What happened" comments
from all of my friends.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.450
(door shuts)

15:17.517 --> 15:19.252
How ya like me now, huh?

15:19.319 --> 15:20.153
Huh?!

15:20.220 --> 15:21.721
BURT: "Too bad you have
a girlfriend."

15:21.788 --> 15:22.922
(giggles)

15:22.990 --> 15:24.891
That was definitely flirting.
Mm-hmm.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.326
I can't have her like this!

15:26.393 --> 15:27.794
It's wrong
and I'll feel terrible.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.829
But I can't tell her what I did.

15:29.896 --> 15:32.699
She'll think I'm some kind
of weird, conniving creep.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.700
I'm screwed!

15:33.766 --> 15:35.969
Get over here.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.437
Are you gonna slap me?

15:37.504 --> 15:39.172
What? No.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.274
I was just want gonna say...

15:41.341 --> 15:43.543
Ow!
Yes, I'm slapping you!

15:43.610 --> 15:44.711
Pull yourself together!

15:44.777 --> 15:47.947
This is working out exactly how
we planned it.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.316
All right,
now you gotta call her

15:49.382 --> 15:50.783
and invite her out
for Valentine's Day.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.152
But don't wait too long.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.220
Who knows how many other losers

15:53.286 --> 15:54.721
have been waiting around
to ask her out.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.722
Mm-hmm.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.326
Another big decision to make.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.661
Keep lying and get
the girl of my dreams

16:01.728 --> 16:05.032
tell him the truth and
maybe loosing her forever.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.836
Hey, it turns out my girlfriend
has to work tonight.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.705
You want to hang out?

16:18.511 --> 16:21.114
It's a shame your
girlfriend was busy
on Valentine's Day.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.682
What can you do?

16:22.749 --> 16:25.052
(soft acoustic guitar plays)

16:28.555 --> 16:32.792
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to Room For Improv'ment.

16:32.859 --> 16:33.726
That's your girlfriend.

16:34.927 --> 16:35.895
This is where she works?

16:35.962 --> 16:37.464
My name is Mary-Louise,

16:37.530 --> 16:40.067
and these are the Room
For Improv'ment Players.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.102
Those are the people
from the restaurant.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.070
What's going on?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.304
Hold on. Just keep watching.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.039
We're gonna start
with a short play

16:46.106 --> 16:47.674
written just a few hours ago

16:47.740 --> 16:50.077
by a really sweet guy
I met last week.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.745
And it starts like this:

16:54.281 --> 16:56.916
(plays brief intro)

16:56.983 --> 17:00.753
Whoa. You have a baby
in that cart.

17:00.820 --> 17:04.791
And I work at a grocery store
and doodle on fruit. Looks like

17:04.857 --> 17:06.926
we both have some interesting
and appealing quirks.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.496
That's called
a meet-cute.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.632
(somber chords playing)

17:14.934 --> 17:19.306
Burt, I worry about our son
falling head over heels

17:19.372 --> 17:21.741
for a girl with a boyfriend.

17:21.808 --> 17:25.312
I was young once.
I know how he feels.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.880
Tell us how he
feels... in song.

17:27.947 --> 17:32.252
* So many nights *

17:32.319 --> 17:35.722
* I'd sit by my window *

17:35.788 --> 17:39.159
* Waiting for someone *

17:39.226 --> 17:44.497
* To sing me his song *

17:44.564 --> 17:49.836
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh *

17:51.838 --> 17:53.072
Hey, you!

17:53.140 --> 17:55.142
She's passed out!
Leave her alone!

17:57.310 --> 17:58.645
Even though
you're not my girlfriend,

17:58.711 --> 18:01.248
I'm going to carry you home
and keep you safe.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.983
Because you...

18:04.050 --> 18:06.919
you...

18:06.986 --> 18:12.192
* You light up my life *

18:12.259 --> 18:16.196
* You give me hope *

18:16.263 --> 18:20.333
* To carry on *

18:20.400 --> 18:24.937
* You light up my days *

18:25.004 --> 18:29.609
* And fill my nights... *

18:29.676 --> 18:33.880
* With song... *

18:35.782 --> 18:39.152
Yeah, Sabrina, he
and his new girlfriend

18:39.219 --> 18:41.421
are making tons of whoopie.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.089
Shut up! I'm trying

18:43.156 --> 18:45.358
to step up your
game a notch.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.900
Well, I'll cover Jimmy's shift
so you can have a double date.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.202
No...!

18:57.737 --> 18:59.772
I don't get why you need
a fake girlfriend

18:59.839 --> 19:02.709
when you're hot enough to have
lots of real girlfriends.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.844
Well, I'm flattered that
a beautiful girl like you

19:04.911 --> 19:07.146
really did actually say
that in real life

19:07.214 --> 19:08.248
because that's
really what happened.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.750
But there is
only one girl I want.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.855
I'm Wyatt.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.691
And I'd rather watch men
on ice playing with sticks

19:18.758 --> 19:21.594
than pay attention
to my girlfriend. Oh!

19:22.829 --> 19:24.564
Call her and tell her

19:24.631 --> 19:26.866
your fake girlfriend
has to work.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.802
It'll be a Valentine's
Day miracle. (grunts)

19:29.869 --> 19:31.804
And stop acting like
tricking her is wrong,

19:31.871 --> 19:35.775
or I'll slap you again
because that's how I parent.

19:39.612 --> 19:43.216
Sabrina, hello.
My girlfriend is busy.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.418
You want to go out tonight?

19:48.755 --> 19:50.189
And here we are.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.524
I wrote this play

19:51.591 --> 19:53.393
because I couldn't think
of a decent way

19:53.460 --> 19:56.329
to show all the history
that led up to this lie.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.631
And I hope more than anything

19:58.698 --> 20:01.968
that you will-- in the spirit
of Valentine's Day--

20:02.034 --> 20:04.271
please forgive me.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.205
I love you.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.775
And I've loved you
since the day I met you,

20:08.841 --> 20:11.143
and I hope
that you love me, too.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.980
What do you say?

20:27.627 --> 20:28.928
Sabrina!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.703
I hate kissing in public.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.705
* *

20:42.809 --> 20:49.115
* You give me hope to carry on *

20:49.181 --> 20:53.486
* You light up my days *

20:53.553 --> 20:57.357
* And fill my nights *

20:57.424 --> 21:01.561
* With song! *

21:01.628 --> 21:05.164
* It can't be wrong *

21:05.231 --> 21:11.003
* When it feels so right *

21:11.070 --> 21:21.714
* 'Cause you,
you light up my life. *

21:22.649 --> 21:25.618
The show was
over budget.
