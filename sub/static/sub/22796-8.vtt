Ricky...

Ricky, you've got

02:00.245 --> 02:01.997
a fucking can

02:00.245 --> 02:01.997
on your head!

02:02.081 --> 02:03.373
Take the can off

02:02.081 --> 02:03.373
his fucking head.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.001
Ricky, look!

02:03.457 --> 02:06.001
Just pull it off!

02:08.670 --> 02:09.838

02:08.670 --> 02:09.838
Fuck!

02:09.922 --> 02:11.757
What the fuck

02:09.922 --> 02:11.757
happened last night?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.468
I don't know.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.468
Boys, why am I

02:11.840 --> 02:14.468
hard as a rock?

02:15.844 --> 02:17.721
Bubs, what the fuck

02:15.844 --> 02:17.721
is all over your face?

02:17.805 --> 02:18.973
What?

02:19.056 --> 02:21.100
Oh, I got my lashes

02:19.056 --> 02:21.100
done, did I?

02:21.182 --> 02:22.977
Ricky:

02:21.182 --> 02:22.977
What?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.812
Hey, what's going on

02:23.060 --> 02:24.812
there, pussy lips?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.605
Huh?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.605
Ricky:

02:24.895 --> 02:26.605
You've got legs

02:24.895 --> 02:26.605
on your face

02:26.688 --> 02:28.107
and the goatee's

02:26.688 --> 02:28.107
like a muff.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.734
That's fucking genius.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.734
Who the fuck did this?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.111
Will you guys get

02:30.818 --> 02:32.111
the fuck out of here?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.821
Give us a minute.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.821
Get the fuck...

02:33.904 --> 02:35.489
Ricky:

02:33.904 --> 02:35.489
Who made my cock hard?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.783
Julian:

02:35.572 --> 02:37.783
Nobody here made

02:35.572 --> 02:37.783
your cock hard.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.076
Bubbles:

02:37.866 --> 02:39.076
Probably Julian.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.535
Julian:

02:39.159 --> 02:40.535
Fuck off, Bubs.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.163
Bubbles:

02:40.619 --> 02:43.163
Ricky, straighten

02:40.619 --> 02:43.163
up, would you?

02:43.246 --> 02:47.375
I'm not being

02:43.246 --> 02:47.375
your fucking crutch

02:43.246 --> 02:47.375
all day, bud.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.168
Straighten up.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.168
Boys, I need

02:47.459 --> 02:49.168
some fucking weed

02:49.252 --> 02:51.005
or some hash or

02:49.252 --> 02:51.005
I could die today.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.380
I'm not

02:51.088 --> 02:52.380
fucking joking.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.380
There's no time, Ricky.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.133
We'll get that later.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.176
You guys made me stay here

02:54.215 --> 02:57.176
to make the video,

02:57.260 --> 02:58.846
and that's what's happening,

02:57.260 --> 02:58.846
making the video.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.473
All day today, and

02:58.929 --> 03:01.473
I'm calling the shots.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.933
Team effort.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.933
We can't

03:01.556 --> 03:02.933
do it today.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.225
Let's just stay

03:03.017 --> 03:04.225
another night.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.477
We'll do it

03:04.309 --> 03:05.477
tomorrow.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.477
Nope.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.728
It's happening

03:05.560 --> 03:06.728
today, Ricky.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.147
Okay... Ricky!

03:06.812 --> 03:08.147
(Heaving)

03:08.271 --> 03:09.564
Look out!

03:08.271 --> 03:09.564
Ricky, don't.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.734
Okay, this is what we

03:11.358 --> 03:12.734
should do first, man.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.028
Get a bunch

03:12.818 --> 03:14.028
of escorts,

03:14.111 --> 03:15.654
get them in bikinis,

03:14.111 --> 03:15.654
go to the beach...

03:15.737 --> 03:17.489
No.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.489
have them jumping around

03:15.737 --> 03:17.489
with balls and stuff.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.491
No.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.491
What?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.491
Zip it.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.202
What?

03:19.574 --> 03:23.202
I already booked

03:19.574 --> 03:23.202
a car... legally.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.164
A nice rental car that

03:23.286 --> 03:25.164
we're going to use.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.415
We don't need ladies.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.415
I've got a shot list.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.084
You start renting

03:27.499 --> 03:29.084
a bunch of prostitutes,

03:29.168 --> 03:30.711
that's what flags

03:29.168 --> 03:30.711
a fucking credit card.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.087
We're not doing that.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.797
I've got the whole

03:32.171 --> 03:33.797
video figured out.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.216
We just do this my way

03:36.299 --> 03:38.052
with my vision,

03:36.299 --> 03:38.052
and I'm telling you,

03:38.135 --> 03:41.096
there's a very good

03:38.135 --> 03:41.096
chance this could

03:38.135 --> 03:41.096
be a mega hit,

03:41.180 --> 03:42.389
and then I'm a star.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.391
Bubs, you're not

03:42.472 --> 03:44.391
going to become a star

03:44.474 --> 03:46.018
from one fucking song.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.018
You don't know that.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.936
And why would you

03:46.101 --> 03:47.936
want to be a star?

03:46.101 --> 03:47.936
Billy Ray Cyrus.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.855
Listen, peop...

03:48.020 --> 03:49.855
Billy Ray Cyrus.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.606
People that are famous,

03:49.938 --> 03:51.606
their lives are fucked.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.234
Look, if this happened,

03:51.690 --> 03:54.234
it would be better

03:51.690 --> 03:54.234
for all of us.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.986
I'm doing this

03:54.317 --> 03:55.986
for us.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.405
You just need to know

03:56.070 --> 03:58.405
your place, Julian,

03:58.488 --> 04:00.281
and learn to trust

03:58.488 --> 04:00.281
in Brock Typhoon.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.242
Trust me.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.242
(Scoffing)

04:03.118 --> 04:04.578
I'll get the car.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.829
Julian:

04:04.661 --> 04:05.829
Look at him,

04:05.913 --> 04:07.081
already walking

04:05.913 --> 04:07.081
like a dick,

04:07.164 --> 04:08.665
calling himself

04:07.164 --> 04:08.665
Brock Typhoon.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.752
This better not be

04:08.749 --> 04:11.752
a nightmare today.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.752
Oh, fuck, Ricky!

04:11.835 --> 04:14.755
I'm okay.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.755
Get up.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.755
Oh, fuck.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.798
Get up. Up.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.846
Can you walk like

04:21.302 --> 04:22.846
a human being?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.725
Bubbles:

04:24.932 --> 04:26.725
Yup. Right like this.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.602
Julian:

04:26.808 --> 04:28.602
Right here?

04:26.808 --> 04:28.602
Is this good?

04:26.808 --> 04:28.602
Yes. Right here.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.311
Right here, but

04:28.685 --> 04:30.311
you've got to...

04:30.395 --> 04:33.232
you've got to angle...

04:30.395 --> 04:33.232
like, back out

04:30.395 --> 04:33.232
this way, Julian,

04:33.314 --> 04:34.691
so that I'm...

04:33.314 --> 04:34.691
Bubs, I'm not

04:33.314 --> 04:34.691
going to pull...

04:34.775 --> 04:36.359
I'm not pulling out in

04:34.775 --> 04:36.359
the middle of the street

04:36.443 --> 04:38.570
and stopping

04:36.443 --> 04:38.570
traffic for this!

04:36.443 --> 04:38.570
Just for a second.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.488
There's noth...

04:38.653 --> 04:40.488
Just start strumming!

04:40.572 --> 04:42.950
I need that in the

04:40.572 --> 04:42.950
fucking background!

04:43.033 --> 04:44.910
Bubs, your head

04:43.033 --> 04:44.910
is swelling again.

04:44.993 --> 04:48.329
(Exasperated sigh)

04:44.993 --> 04:48.329
All right. Keep me cool.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.249
But I mean, it needs

04:48.413 --> 04:50.249
to look right.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.417
Can you just angle it...?

04:50.331 --> 04:52.417
Can you see that back there?

04:52.500 --> 04:53.877
Cameraman:

04:52.500 --> 04:53.877
Yup.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.877
(Sighing)

04:53.961 --> 04:56.337
Like that?

04:53.961 --> 04:56.337
Cameraman:

04:53.961 --> 04:56.337
And... action.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.423
Julian:

04:56.421 --> 04:58.423
All right,

04:56.421 --> 04:58.423
start strumming!

04:58.506 --> 05:01.009
I'll strum when

04:58.506 --> 05:01.009
I'm good and goddamn

04:58.506 --> 05:01.009
fucking ready!

05:01.093 --> 05:02.510
Ricky:

05:01.093 --> 05:02.510
(Heaving)

05:02.594 --> 05:05.097
Bubbles:

05:02.594 --> 05:05.097
Ricky, Ricky...

05:05.180 --> 05:07.141
Camera guy, film me.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.683
Don't worry about

05:07.224 --> 05:08.683
this. Ricky!

05:08.767 --> 05:11.228
(Retching)

05:08.767 --> 05:11.228
Oh, my God.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.938
Ricky, do you see

05:11.311 --> 05:12.938
what's going on here?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.816
Bubs... we need a fucking

05:13.021 --> 05:15.816
dispensary, man.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.901
This is going to

05:15.899 --> 05:17.901
keep happening.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.861
I'm fucked.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.861
I'm trying to shoot

05:17.985 --> 05:19.861
a music video here.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.280
It's looking

05:19.945 --> 05:21.280
great, buddy,

05:21.362 --> 05:22.823
but seriously,

05:21.362 --> 05:22.823
we've got to go, man.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.241
Don't touch me.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.241
Bubs, we've

05:22.906 --> 05:24.241
got enough...

05:24.324 --> 05:25.533
we've got enough

05:24.324 --> 05:25.533
footage for this.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.952
We can edit this

05:25.617 --> 05:26.952
all in the video.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.536
Oh, you're a big

05:27.035 --> 05:28.536
editing expert now,

05:28.620 --> 05:30.164
are you there, quiff cheeks?

05:31.039 --> 05:34.793
Fuck's sakes. Just put

05:31.039 --> 05:34.793
the fucking cameras on me.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.211
Forget about him.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.629
Okay, here we...

05:37.712 --> 05:40.215
(Retching)

05:37.712 --> 05:40.215
Ricky...

05:43.135 --> 05:44.719
Unbelievable.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.306
Unbelievable. Just get

05:44.803 --> 05:47.306
the fucking shot, would you?

05:47.388 --> 05:50.225
Bubs, I need weed!

05:47.388 --> 05:50.225
I need weed

05:50.309 --> 05:51.935
to get fucking

05:50.309 --> 05:51.935
straightened out

05:50.309 --> 05:51.935
here. I'm fucked!

05:52.019 --> 05:54.479
Would you shut up

05:52.019 --> 05:54.479
for two fucking

05:52.019 --> 05:54.479
seconds about weed?

05:54.562 --> 05:56.773
We've got to go!

05:54.562 --> 05:56.773
I need to fucking

05:54.562 --> 05:56.773
smoke some weed

05:56.857 --> 05:58.108
or I'm not going

05:56.857 --> 05:58.108
to make it.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.442
Just get it on me.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.442
Here we go.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.442

06:14.249 --> 06:16.293
Julian:

06:14.249 --> 06:16.293
Have we got enough?

06:16.375 --> 06:17.544
No, we don't

06:16.375 --> 06:17.544
have enough,

06:17.627 --> 06:19.629
but what fucking

06:17.627 --> 06:19.629
choice do I have?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.464
Let's just go to

06:21.548 --> 06:23.382
for fuck's sakes!

06:23.466 --> 06:25.135

06:27.428 --> 06:29.097
Julian:

06:27.428 --> 06:29.097
Where are we

06:27.428 --> 06:29.097
going to next?

06:29.181 --> 06:31.266
Bubbles:

06:29.181 --> 06:31.266
Go to fucking Mel's Diner.

06:31.350 --> 06:35.062
Okay, just make sure you've

06:31.350 --> 06:35.062
got that over my shoulder.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.231
That's the key here.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.231
Okay, just a

06:35.145 --> 06:37.231
second here, Bubs.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.358
Shouldn't we be

06:37.314 --> 06:39.358
shooting, like, at

06:37.314 --> 06:39.358
a different angle?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.193
'Cause when you

06:39.440 --> 06:41.193
cut it together with

06:39.440 --> 06:41.193
the last scene,

06:41.276 --> 06:42.569
it's going to look

06:41.276 --> 06:42.569
totally fucked.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.238
No, it's not going to

06:42.652 --> 06:44.238
look totally fucked.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.655
It's going to look amazing.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.448
It's my vision.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.448
You just...

06:47.532 --> 06:49.826
Okay, I thought

06:47.532 --> 06:49.826
we were working

06:47.532 --> 06:49.826
as a team here,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.578
but if you want

06:49.910 --> 06:51.578
amateur hour, then...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.578
We are.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.373
We are working as a team,

06:51.661 --> 06:54.373
but I'm calling the shots.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.790
And if you would just

06:54.455 --> 06:55.790
listen to me,

06:55.874 --> 06:57.167
you would know

06:55.874 --> 06:57.167
I'm going to cut

06:55.874 --> 06:57.167
something in

06:57.251 --> 06:59.086
between the two

06:57.251 --> 06:59.086
things, obviously.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.670
Mister vag-for-a-mouth.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.672
Hey, hey. You don't

07:00.754 --> 07:02.672
be calling me

07:02.756 --> 07:04.132
any more

07:02.756 --> 07:04.132
fucking names.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.759
You got it?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.094
I'm sorry.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.054
Okay.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.054
I'm sorry, just...

07:09.137 --> 07:10.471
Okay. Just... shouldn't

07:09.137 --> 07:10.471
we at least wait

07:10.555 --> 07:12.015
until there's ladies

07:10.555 --> 07:12.015
going in the background?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.767
No, that's a cliché.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.767
You don't need it.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.685
We can zoom in

07:13.850 --> 07:15.685
on them. Bubs...

07:13.850 --> 07:15.685
We don't need it.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.021
Just... just roll

07:15.769 --> 07:18.021
the fucking camera.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.021
All right! Whatever, man.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.522
Cameraman:

07:18.105 --> 07:19.522
We're always rolling.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.900
Okay, so I'm going to

07:19.606 --> 07:21.900
use this for the chorus.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.903

08:51.323 --> 08:53.200
Cool. Can I just

08:51.323 --> 08:53.200
see your card?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.160
Do have a... do you

08:53.283 --> 08:55.160
have a medical card?

08:55.243 --> 08:56.536
Well, yeah,

08:55.243 --> 08:56.536
about that.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.079
I mean, I've got

08:56.619 --> 08:58.079
a ton of them, but

08:58.163 --> 08:59.998
I don't have

08:58.163 --> 08:59.998
it with me. But

08:58.163 --> 08:59.998
did Jim call you?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.916
Or do you know Jim

09:00.081 --> 09:01.916
or Jim knows you

09:00.081 --> 09:01.916
really well?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.960
Jim? Uh, Jim?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.960
No, I...

09:04.044 --> 09:05.795
Jim, who?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.795
Or is it Adam?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.422
Adam... that

09:05.879 --> 09:07.422
called it in?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.422
Adam...

09:07.506 --> 09:09.299

09:07.506 --> 09:09.299

09:09.383 --> 09:11.510

09:09.383 --> 09:11.510
Gary. Yeah.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.510
Gary? Gary? Um...

09:11.592 --> 09:14.095
No, I don't...

09:11.592 --> 09:14.095
Mike?

09:11.592 --> 09:14.095
Mike? No.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.848
Um, I... Yeah, I...

09:16.931 --> 09:19.267
I need to see a...

09:16.931 --> 09:19.267
I know, I get it, I get it.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.228
But here's the thing,

09:19.351 --> 09:21.228
like, I just need

09:19.351 --> 09:21.228
something really bad.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.730
My head is about to fucking

09:21.311 --> 09:23.730
come off my body here.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.730
(Stammering)

09:23.813 --> 09:25.690
Look, I'm so sorry.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.690
I'm sorry about that.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.983
I would love to

09:25.773 --> 09:26.983
sell it, I just...

09:27.067 --> 09:28.651
I can't sell you

09:27.067 --> 09:28.651
anything without a...

09:28.735 --> 09:30.195
without a medical card.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.613
Look at all this

09:30.278 --> 09:32.613
beautiful stuff.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.613
I know, man, I know.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.449
There's this, right?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.449
Like, that would just...

09:34.533 --> 09:35.909
Well, I mean...

09:34.533 --> 09:35.909
That should take care

09:34.533 --> 09:35.909
of everything, no?

09:35.992 --> 09:39.204
Tommy Chong?

09:39.704 --> 09:41.415
Yeah.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.415
Are you...

09:41.498 --> 09:43.291
Are you fucking

09:41.498 --> 09:43.291
kidding me?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.876
What? He's my uncle.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.670
Tommy Chong is

09:44.959 --> 09:47.670
your fucking uncle?

09:47.754 --> 09:48.796
Yeah, I thought

09:47.754 --> 09:48.796
I said that.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.173
But yeah, Tommy Chong's

09:48.880 --> 09:50.173
my uncle

09:50.257 --> 09:51.341
and actually I was

09:50.257 --> 09:51.341
buying stuff for me,

09:51.425 --> 09:52.509
but mostly for him.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.302
And he gets super

09:52.592 --> 09:54.302
fucking cranky

09:54.386 --> 09:55.720
if he doesn't get his...

09:54.386 --> 09:55.720
Fuck, I love

09:54.386 --> 09:55.720
Tommy Chong.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.223
his weed and oil

09:55.803 --> 09:58.223
and hash and...

09:58.306 --> 10:01.226
I just... Frig, my

09:58.306 --> 10:01.226
hands are tied, man!

10:01.309 --> 10:02.894
I can't... I...

10:01.309 --> 10:02.894
I just...

10:01.309 --> 10:02.894
(Sighing)

10:02.977 --> 10:04.771
I can't sell you

10:02.977 --> 10:04.771
anything without

10:02.977 --> 10:04.771
a medical card, man.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.523
Not even for Tommy Chong?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.523
He's a fucking legend, man...

10:06.606 --> 10:08.400
He<i> is</i> a fucking legend.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.400
And he's going

10:06.606 --> 10:08.400
to be pissed off

10:08.483 --> 10:10.860
when I tell him

10:08.483 --> 10:10.860
you guys said, "No,

10:08.483 --> 10:10.860
fuck him," basically.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.613
So, up to you, but...

10:10.944 --> 10:13.613
Fuck. Uh...

10:13.696 --> 10:16.074
you know, for

10:13.696 --> 10:16.074
Tommy Chong, shit.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.618
Uh, I got... I got

10:16.157 --> 10:18.618
some brand new shit.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.537
Um... uh, shit.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.537
Wicked! Thank you!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.789
This is mostly indica,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.789
Thank you.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.832
but, uh, just a

10:22.872 --> 10:24.832
little bit heady.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.251
Perfect. Done.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.251
I love this shit.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.795
This is good.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.795
Yes, great.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.795
Shit.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.047
Does he like, uh...

10:28.878 --> 10:31.047
Oh, sativa.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.882
He fucking loves sativa.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.882
This is pure sativa.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.635
Laughing. He likes...

10:32.966 --> 10:35.635
laughing shit.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.635
You are the fucking man.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.928
He'll laugh that shit.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.928
Okay, done.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.514
Oh, uh, these, uh,

10:37.011 --> 10:39.514
brand new gummies.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.517
They will make you feel

10:39.598 --> 10:42.517
like freaking Superman.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.352
Nice. How many do

10:42.601 --> 10:44.352
you have to take?

10:42.601 --> 10:44.352
Brand new company.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.437
Just one?

10:44.436 --> 10:45.437
I mean... yeah, one.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.938
You know what?

10:45.520 --> 10:46.938
I got, uh...

10:47.021 --> 10:48.815
Does he like

10:47.021 --> 10:48.815
chocolate, man?

10:48.898 --> 10:49.983
I got some...

10:48.898 --> 10:49.983
Chocolate's great.

10:48.898 --> 10:49.983
Yeah, yeah.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.734
Oh, freaking

10:50.066 --> 10:51.734
great chocolates.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.362
Um, these are so...

10:54.446 --> 10:57.491
Uh, these are so good.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.491
There's a paperclip

10:54.446 --> 10:57.491
in there, man.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.908
Doing a little sampling?

10:57.574 --> 10:58.908
That's okay.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.577
Just... I only had one.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.577
Yeah, that's cool.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.496
Um, these are

11:00.660 --> 11:02.496
so great. I mean,

11:02.579 --> 11:04.205
they're probably

11:02.579 --> 11:04.205
about as half as

11:02.579 --> 11:04.205
strong as those.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.665
Okay. I'll take

11:04.289 --> 11:05.665
some of those.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.665
Okay, great.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.916
Well...

11:05.748 --> 11:06.916
You know what?

11:05.748 --> 11:06.916
We'll take it all.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.335
Just put it

11:07.000 --> 11:08.335
on the card.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.794
Sh... All this?

11:08.418 --> 11:09.794
Yup. All of it.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.794
You got it.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.087
All right.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.087
We'll do it.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.381
All right. Cool.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.381
Man, Tommy Chong!

11:13.465 --> 11:15.175
Freaking A, man.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.175
You are the

11:13.465 --> 11:15.175
fucking man.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.844
Fucking A. Could you...

11:15.258 --> 11:17.844
Do you think you could

11:15.258 --> 11:17.844
get him to come in

11:17.927 --> 11:19.638
and, like, get

11:17.927 --> 11:19.638
a picture with me?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.638
Absolutely.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.473
Oh man, for sure.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.473
And we'll put it on

11:19.720 --> 11:21.473
the wall or something?

11:21.556 --> 11:22.807
We'll get a

11:21.556 --> 11:22.807
picture of you.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.058
We'll get it made

11:22.890 --> 11:24.058
and then autographed.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.310
You're kidding.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.310
Fucking A.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.061
Yes, let's, uh...

11:25.393 --> 11:27.061
And, you know,

11:27.145 --> 11:30.731
just tell him

11:27.145 --> 11:30.731
I'm a frickin' huge

11:27.145 --> 11:30.731
frickin' fan, man.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.067
Yeah, you can...

11:30.815 --> 11:33.067
Yeah, take those to him.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.861
Yeah, man.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.861
Yeah, yeah,

11:33.151 --> 11:34.861
yeah, yeah.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.321
I mean, freaking A,

11:36.404 --> 11:37.738
that's why I'm in this

11:36.404 --> 11:37.738
freaking business.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.157
Because of him, man.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.157
This is...

11:39.240 --> 11:40.825
Yeah, get that last

11:39.240 --> 11:40.825
one. Yeah, yeah.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.118
Awesome, man.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.118
Frickin' A, man.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.037
Just... Man, that's

11:42.202 --> 11:44.037
freaking awesome.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.206
Thank you.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.457
Where's my uncle's

11:46.289 --> 11:47.457
credit card?

11:47.541 --> 11:48.791
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.791
Shit.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.251
(Laughing)

11:48.875 --> 11:50.251
(Chuckle)

11:48.875 --> 11:50.251
Yeah, man.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.711
All right, have...

11:50.335 --> 11:52.711
Yeah, have a

11:50.335 --> 11:52.711
great day, man.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.465
Freaking A!

11:52.795 --> 11:55.465
Tommy Chong, you guys!

11:55.549 --> 11:56.799
Do you know who

11:55.549 --> 11:56.799
that is? Come on!

11:58.343 --> 11:59.969
I didn't give a shit

11:58.343 --> 11:59.969
about how much weed

12:00.053 --> 12:01.262
Ricky bought

12:00.053 --> 12:01.262
with that credit card

12:01.346 --> 12:02.763
because the credit

12:01.346 --> 12:02.763
card wasn't mine,

12:02.847 --> 12:05.392
but one thing I didn't

12:02.847 --> 12:05.392
think about was edibles.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.144
Who eats that many fucking

12:05.475 --> 12:08.144
weed gummies at a time?

12:08.228 --> 12:11.231
Ricky. He's stupid.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.231
That shit fucks you up.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.940
Julian's a fucking

12:11.314 --> 12:12.940
terrible assistant.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.942
I mean, who lets

12:13.024 --> 12:14.942
somebody like Ricky

12:15.026 --> 12:16.444
into a weed dispensary

12:16.528 --> 12:19.197
with an unlimited

12:16.528 --> 12:19.197
credit card, unsupervised?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.491
Now this video's going to be

12:19.280 --> 12:21.491
even fucking harder to shoot

12:21.575 --> 12:22.825
with Ricky all fucked up.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.203
(Strumming)

12:25.286 --> 12:27.414
Julian, hold the fucking

12:25.286 --> 12:27.414
camera up higher.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.624
Bubs, I...

12:27.497 --> 12:29.624
You're going to make me

12:27.497 --> 12:29.624
look like Bela Lugosi.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.585
You're perfectly

12:29.708 --> 12:31.585
framed in here.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.585
I know,

12:31.668 --> 12:33.670
but I need a profile

12:31.668 --> 12:33.670
shot, like a...

12:31.668 --> 12:33.670
Ricky...

12:33.752 --> 12:34.921
Ricky, pull the fuck

12:33.752 --> 12:34.921
over. I'm driving.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.631
...over into the canyon.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.631
Pay attention.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.882
Just...

12:36.715 --> 12:37.882
If I'm like this...

12:37.965 --> 12:39.676
(Thud, clattering)

12:37.965 --> 12:39.676
Jesus!

12:39.758 --> 12:41.720
Ricky:

12:39.758 --> 12:41.720
(Wheezing laughter)

12:39.758 --> 12:41.720
Oh, my fuck. Ricky!

12:41.802 --> 12:44.055
Ricky, wisen up!

12:41.802 --> 12:44.055
You fucking hit somebody.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.140
You fucking idiot.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.140
You jumped in the...

12:46.224 --> 12:48.560
Dude, I'm on

12:46.224 --> 12:48.560
the sidewalk.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.311
Oh, my fuck.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.311
Are you all right?

12:50.395 --> 12:52.272
Oh, my fuck.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.272
That's Tony Hawk!

12:52.355 --> 12:54.566
You're Tony Hawk!

12:52.355 --> 12:54.566
Hey, man. Cool.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.817
Ricky, you hit Tony Hawk

12:54.649 --> 12:56.817
with the car!

12:56.901 --> 12:58.777
Oh, my fuck.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.777
Are you okay?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.238
Uh, I think so.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.781
Oh, hey, I...

13:00.321 --> 13:02.781
I know you guys.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.535
My oldest son and I

13:02.865 --> 13:05.535
watch your show

13:02.865 --> 13:05.535
all the time.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.328
Right on, man.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.328
Really?

13:07.412 --> 13:09.664
That's decent.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.664
(Awkward chuckle)

13:09.748 --> 13:11.165
What are you doing here?

13:11.249 --> 13:13.710
Well, we were trying

13:11.249 --> 13:13.710
to make a music video

13:13.792 --> 13:16.463
for a song I recorded

13:13.792 --> 13:16.463
with Alex Lifeson

13:13.792 --> 13:16.463
from Rush.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.382
Oh, the guy you

13:16.546 --> 13:19.382
called a drunk

13:16.546 --> 13:19.382
male prostitute?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.676
Yeah, that... that guy.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.970
I mean, I'm trying to

13:21.760 --> 13:23.970
make this awesome video

13:24.053 --> 13:25.221
and these guys keep

13:24.053 --> 13:25.221
fucking ruining it.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.514
No,<i> he's</i> ruining it.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.099
Pissin' on stuff,

13:26.598 --> 13:28.099
pukin', and now

13:28.182 --> 13:30.268
running over world-famous

13:28.182 --> 13:30.268
celebrities

13:30.351 --> 13:31.770
with the car...

13:30.351 --> 13:31.770
Julian:

13:30.351 --> 13:31.770
Nice going, you dummy.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.438
while you're fucked up.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.438
Way to go, Ricky.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.273
Look, you're not going

13:33.521 --> 13:35.273
to call the cops on us,

13:35.356 --> 13:37.233
are you, man?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.233
'Cause we'd be

13:35.356 --> 13:37.233
really fucked.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.652
We've got no

13:37.317 --> 13:38.652
insurance, nothing.

13:38.735 --> 13:39.902
We've no money.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.615
Uh... no, but

13:39.986 --> 13:43.615
I'll make you a deal.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.032
How about if... uh...

13:45.116 --> 13:46.867
you guys go to the

13:45.116 --> 13:46.867
skate park with me

13:46.951 --> 13:48.787
because my son's there

13:46.951 --> 13:48.787
skating right now.

13:48.869 --> 13:49.912
He will freak out

13:49.996 --> 13:51.498
if I show up

13:49.996 --> 13:51.498
with you guys.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.166
You want us to

13:51.581 --> 13:53.166
go to the skate

13:51.581 --> 13:53.166
park with you?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.126
We can do that.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.126
Tony:

13:53.249 --> 13:55.126
Yeah.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.546
Think I could get

13:55.209 --> 13:58.546
a shot of you doing

13:55.209 --> 13:58.546
something for my music video?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.548
Yeah, we're going to be

13:58.630 --> 14:00.548
skating anyway. Sure.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.634
Nice!

14:00.632 --> 14:02.634
Holy fuck, boys.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.926
Let's do it.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.926
Come on.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.261
Unbelievable.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.261
All right.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.555
(Mixed excited chatter)

14:07.639 --> 14:10.016
Ricky, you...

14:07.639 --> 14:10.016
Ricky...

14:07.639 --> 14:10.016
get in the

14:07.639 --> 14:10.016
passenger's seat.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.434
I'm driving,

14:10.099 --> 14:11.434
you stupid asshole.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.935
Straighten up!

14:13.019 --> 14:15.313
I'm going to...

14:13.019 --> 14:15.313
I'm going to

14:13.019 --> 14:15.313
skate there.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.773
Various:

14:15.396 --> 14:16.773
All right, we'll see

14:15.396 --> 14:16.773
you there, man.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.484
Ricky... Ricky,

14:16.897 --> 14:19.484
wisen the fuck up.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.277
You could've

14:19.567 --> 14:21.277
killed Tony Hawk!

14:21.361 --> 14:23.822
(Laughing)

14:21.361 --> 14:23.822
I know!

14:21.361 --> 14:23.822
Julian:

14:21.361 --> 14:23.822
Get in the car!

14:23.904 --> 14:25.699
Bubbles:

14:23.904 --> 14:25.699
Boys, check it out.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.949
Decent.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.203
Decent.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.203
Hey, Riley.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.290
Look who I ran into...

14:31.579 --> 14:34.290
or who ran into me.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.667
Hey. Riley.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.667
No way.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.168
How you doing?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.168
How's it

14:35.750 --> 14:37.168
going, man?

14:37.251 --> 14:38.586
Bubbles.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.586
Julian.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.586
How's it going?

14:38.670 --> 14:39.796
Hey, man,

14:38.670 --> 14:39.796
I'm Ricky.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.796
How's it going?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.631
Yeah, Ricky hit

14:39.879 --> 14:41.631
your dad with a car.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.717
Ouch.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.717
It was an accident,

14:41.715 --> 14:43.717
but he's okay.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.009
Hey,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.009
that's Tom.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.886
Hey, Tom Green,

14:45.092 --> 14:46.886
what are you doing here?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.888
Just shredding it

14:46.969 --> 14:48.888
up there, boys.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.348
Getting her done.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.348
Tony Hawk!

14:50.431 --> 14:52.433
How are you?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.433
Good to see you.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.685
How are you

14:52.517 --> 14:53.685
guys doing? Yeah.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.311
This is decent.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.896
Yeah, we're just

14:55.395 --> 14:56.896
ripping 'er up

14:55.395 --> 14:56.896
there, boys.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.314
Gettin' 'er done.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.314
It's wicked, eh?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.566
Oh, yeah!

14:59.649 --> 15:00.983
Why are you talking

14:59.649 --> 15:00.983
like that?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.362
With the accent.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.362
Canadian.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.362
Canadian accent.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.613
Julian:

15:04.445 --> 15:05.613
We don't talk like that.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.989
I haven't lost

15:05.697 --> 15:06.989
my accent.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.950
Well, we don't

15:07.490 --> 15:09.950
really talk

15:07.490 --> 15:09.950
like that.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.036
Listen, I'm going to be

15:10.034 --> 15:12.036
shooting some clips here

15:12.119 --> 15:14.163
for a music video. Do

15:12.119 --> 15:14.163
you want to be in it?

15:14.247 --> 15:16.875
Could you guys do some

15:14.247 --> 15:16.875
fancy skateboarding?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.459
Yeah, we'll

15:16.957 --> 15:18.459
try. Sure.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.587
Nice.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.587
Oh, my fuck. This is

15:18.543 --> 15:20.587
unbelievable, boys.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.089
Julian: Yes.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.089
Boys, okay, this

15:20.670 --> 15:23.089
is the big time.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.800
The big time.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.800
Don't fuck this up!

16:27.278 --> 16:28.529
Did you see that?

16:28.613 --> 16:30.531
That was unbelievable!

16:30.615 --> 16:32.366
That was

16:30.615 --> 16:32.366
unbelievable.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.661
That was awesome, guys.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.661
That's pretty much

16:32.450 --> 16:34.661
her right there.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.037
Good going, buddy.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.037
That is what

16:34.744 --> 16:37.037
they call a wrap.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.706
The video's done.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.541
Wait! That's

16:38.790 --> 16:40.541
the whole video?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.042
Well, I think.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.210
What about girls?

16:43.294 --> 16:44.963
You're doing a

16:43.294 --> 16:44.963
country music video.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.255
There should be chicks.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.676
Girls, bud.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.676
Oh, yeah.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.261
We're gonna

16:49.759 --> 16:52.261
get 'er done.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.180
(Sigh)

16:54.263 --> 16:56.390
When I was first going to make

16:54.263 --> 16:56.390
a country video I thought,

16:56.474 --> 16:59.185
"Oh, obviously,

16:56.474 --> 16:59.185
I need ladies in it,"

16:56.474 --> 16:59.185
and then I started thinking,

16:59.268 --> 17:00.687
"Well, maybe I don't because

17:00.770 --> 17:02.563
maybe that's just a cliché."

17:02.647 --> 17:05.399
But then Tony Hawk tells me

17:02.647 --> 17:05.399
I need ladies in the video.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.944
That's when I knew

17:05.483 --> 17:07.944
I need ladies in the video

17:08.027 --> 17:09.821
because who's cooler

17:08.027 --> 17:09.821
than Tony Hawk?

17:09.904 --> 17:11.322
Really?

17:11.990 --> 17:13.157
Bubs, I've got to

17:11.990 --> 17:13.157
ask you a question

17:13.240 --> 17:14.826
and I want you to be

17:13.240 --> 17:14.826
straight up with me.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.036
What?

17:14.909 --> 17:17.036
Is Tony Hawk cooler

17:14.909 --> 17:17.036
than me or what?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.205
Is he cooler than you?

17:19.288 --> 17:21.624
Julian:

17:19.288 --> 17:21.624
Yeah. I've been saying

17:19.288 --> 17:21.624
this whole fucking time, man,

17:21.708 --> 17:24.502
"We need ladies

17:21.708 --> 17:24.502
in the fucking video.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.502
We need ladies."

17:24.585 --> 17:26.838
And then you're like,

17:24.585 --> 17:26.838
"Oh, no, it's a cliché.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.631
I'm going to shoot

17:26.921 --> 17:28.631
over there. I'm going

17:26.921 --> 17:28.631
to shoot this."

17:28.715 --> 17:30.800
But then, when

17:28.715 --> 17:30.800
Tony Hawk says

17:28.715 --> 17:30.800
we need ladies,

17:30.884 --> 17:33.052
you're like,

17:30.884 --> 17:33.052
"Oh, yeah. We

17:30.884 --> 17:33.052
need ladies."

17:33.135 --> 17:34.428
Well, no.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.428
So I'm going to

17:33.135 --> 17:34.428
ask you again.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.930
Is he fucking cooler

17:34.512 --> 17:35.930
than me or what?

17:36.014 --> 17:37.473
No, I just...

17:37.557 --> 17:39.726
I mean, he might

17:37.557 --> 17:39.726
know more about...

17:39.809 --> 17:43.437
you know, making videos

17:39.809 --> 17:43.437
that are going to be

17:39.809 --> 17:43.437
internationally famous,

17:43.521 --> 17:45.690
but I don't think

17:43.521 --> 17:45.690
he's cooler than you.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.191
(Scoff)

17:47.274 --> 17:51.029
Julian? Truth be told,

17:47.274 --> 17:51.029
if you want to know,

17:51.111 --> 17:53.948
I don't think anybody in

17:51.111 --> 17:53.948
the world's cooler than you.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.825
Not even the Fonz.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.284
He's cooler

17:55.909 --> 17:57.284
than me, man.

17:57.368 --> 18:00.120
He's not cooler

17:57.368 --> 18:00.120
than you.

17:57.368 --> 18:00.120
I think...

18:00.204 --> 18:01.956
you're one of the coolest

18:00.204 --> 18:01.956
people in the world

18:02.040 --> 18:04.291
and one of the reasons

18:02.040 --> 18:04.291
I want to do this whole thing

18:04.375 --> 18:06.085
where I become a superstar

18:06.168 --> 18:08.462
is just to be

18:06.168 --> 18:08.462
half as cool as you.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.798
(Sigh)

18:10.882 --> 18:12.258
I know you think I'm a...

18:12.341 --> 18:14.761
kind of a nerd sometimes

18:14.844 --> 18:16.637
and I'm not cool,

18:14.844 --> 18:16.637
but if I...

18:17.513 --> 18:19.849
Bubs, Bubs...

18:17.513 --> 18:19.849
...was a superstar

18:17.513 --> 18:19.849
maybe you'd think that.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.809
Bubs, if you want

18:19.933 --> 18:21.809
the truth, man,

18:21.893 --> 18:23.269
I think

18:21.893 --> 18:23.269
"Who's Got Your Belly?"

18:23.352 --> 18:25.145
is really fucking good

18:25.229 --> 18:27.648
and I think it's going

18:25.229 --> 18:27.648
to be a hit, man.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.316
Just...

18:27.732 --> 18:29.316
Really?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.316
Yeah.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.860
'Cause I thought

18:29.400 --> 18:30.860
you guys...

18:29.400 --> 18:30.860
Bubs, stop.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.152
...thought it was fucked.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.152
No, it's good, man.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.905
I'm just

18:32.236 --> 18:33.905
worried, man.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.740
I'm worried that it's

18:33.988 --> 18:35.740
going to become a big hit

18:35.823 --> 18:37.533
and then all of a sudden

18:35.823 --> 18:37.533
your head's going

18:35.823 --> 18:37.533
to fucking grow

18:37.617 --> 18:39.368
and you're just going

18:37.617 --> 18:39.368
to leave us, man.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.620
You're going

18:39.452 --> 18:40.620
to move away

18:40.703 --> 18:42.038
and fucking forget

18:40.703 --> 18:42.038
all about us.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.331
What?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.331
Yes.

18:44.415 --> 18:45.917
Are you guys being

18:44.415 --> 18:45.917
serious right now?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.710
You think if

18:46.000 --> 18:47.710
I became a superstar

18:47.794 --> 18:50.088
I would move away

18:47.794 --> 18:50.088
and forget you guys?

18:50.170 --> 18:51.297
Well, we did

18:50.170 --> 18:51.297
talk about it.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.840
You know what

18:51.380 --> 18:52.840
you get like

18:52.924 --> 18:54.884
when your fucking

18:52.924 --> 18:54.884
head gets all

18:52.924 --> 18:54.884
inflate-y and shit.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.344
Boys!

18:57.428 --> 18:59.430
Oh, my fuck.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.473
Listen.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.979
It doesn't matter how big

19:02.141 --> 19:05.979
of a superstar I became.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.189
Even if I was as big as

19:06.062 --> 19:09.189
the love child of fucking...

19:09.273 --> 19:11.943
Conway Twitty

19:09.273 --> 19:11.943
and Loretta Lynn.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.237
I would never ever

19:12.026 --> 19:15.237
forget about you guys.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.366
Ever. You guys are

19:16.322 --> 19:19.366
my... my family.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.494
You're my only

19:19.450 --> 19:21.494
family. I...

19:21.577 --> 19:25.289
I love you guys more

19:21.577 --> 19:25.289
than anybody on the planet.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.666
Love you too, man.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.250
Love you too, buddy.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.919
That's crazy talk.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.170
All right, I'm

19:30.003 --> 19:31.170
just going to throw

19:31.253 --> 19:33.172
this idea out

19:31.253 --> 19:33.172
here, okay, man?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.590
But what do

19:33.255 --> 19:34.590
you think

19:34.674 --> 19:36.134
about us getting

19:34.674 --> 19:36.134
another hotel

19:34.674 --> 19:36.134
room tonight,

19:36.216 --> 19:38.218
we hit Baz's

19:36.216 --> 19:38.218
fucking party.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.013
We fucking shoot

19:38.302 --> 19:40.013
the shit out of it

19:40.096 --> 19:41.806
with all kinds of

19:40.096 --> 19:41.806
hot chicks and

19:40.096 --> 19:41.806
celebrities, man.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.808
Make the best

19:41.889 --> 19:43.808
fucking video

19:41.889 --> 19:43.808
we possibly can.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.392
What do you

19:43.891 --> 19:45.392
think of that?

19:45.476 --> 19:48.228
Well, it sounds like a

19:45.476 --> 19:48.228
great idea, Julian, but...

19:48.312 --> 19:49.897
we're fucked for money.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.273
We've got the plane tickets.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.566
Maybe we should just

19:51.357 --> 19:52.566
go home. We get...

19:52.650 --> 19:53.818
Well, if...

19:53.901 --> 19:56.278
What if I was to say

19:53.901 --> 19:56.278
I got that covered?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.156
What do you mean

19:56.570 --> 19:58.156
you've got it covered?

19:58.238 --> 19:59.657
I've got the

19:58.238 --> 19:59.657
money covered.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.869
How do you have

20:00.700 --> 20:02.869
the money covered?

20:02.952 --> 20:05.746
Well, Tony Hawk's bag

20:02.952 --> 20:05.746
was open, and his card

20:05.830 --> 20:07.957
in his wallet

20:05.830 --> 20:07.957
was right there,

20:05.830 --> 20:07.957
I took it.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.501
(Chuckle)

20:08.041 --> 20:10.501
You took Tony Hawk's

20:08.041 --> 20:10.501
credit card?

20:10.584 --> 20:13.004
Yeah, and his son Riley's.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.004
I took his as well.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.089
You took Riley's

20:13.087 --> 20:15.089
credit card too?

20:15.173 --> 20:16.883
Bubs, it was just

20:15.173 --> 20:16.883
there. I took it.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.384
I knew... I did it

20:16.966 --> 20:18.384
for you, man.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.220
Awesome, Julian,

20:18.467 --> 20:21.220
'cause I am way

20:18.467 --> 20:21.220
too fucking high

20:21.303 --> 20:24.348
and fucked up to get

20:21.303 --> 20:24.348
on an airplane right now.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.560
So you want to use

20:24.431 --> 20:27.560
Tony Hawk's credit card

20:27.643 --> 20:29.020
to get a fucking hotel room

20:29.103 --> 20:30.479
and go to

20:29.103 --> 20:30.479
Sebastian Bach's party

20:30.563 --> 20:31.814
where all the ladies are?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.566
Yeah, I do.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.317
You know what

20:33.649 --> 20:35.317
I'm going to fucking

20:33.649 --> 20:35.317
say to that, Julian?

20:35.401 --> 20:36.986
Oh, here we go.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.986
What?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.863
You know what I'm

20:37.070 --> 20:38.863
going to say to that?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.863
What? What?

20:40.447 --> 20:42.116
Who's got your belly?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.701
(Laugh)

20:42.200 --> 20:43.701
Yeah!

20:42.200 --> 20:43.701
Bubs, Bubs!

20:43.784 --> 20:45.870
(Chuckle)

20:43.784 --> 20:45.870
Let's fucking do this!

20:45.953 --> 20:47.205
All right.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.205
Let's do it.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.497
Let's do it.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.497
You know what?

20:47.287 --> 20:48.497
What?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.416
You know what?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.416
What?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.043
Fuck it! I'll pay

20:50.499 --> 20:52.043
them back when I'm rich.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.753
You're right.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.713
Fuck, boys,

20:53.836 --> 20:55.713
look at this place.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.048
Wow.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.048
It's fucking

20:55.796 --> 20:57.048
crazy.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.549
Okay, just wait.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.549
Listen.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.426
Listen, I know how

20:58.632 --> 21:00.426
easy it's going to be

21:00.509 --> 21:02.428
to get carried away...

21:00.509 --> 21:02.428
Yeah.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.598
'cause he's obviously

21:02.511 --> 21:05.598
got fucking crazy

21:02.511 --> 21:05.598
amounts of weed here.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.934
Nice.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.934
But just remember, boys,

21:08.017 --> 21:09.769
what we're trying

21:08.017 --> 21:09.769
to do here.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.645
It's the video.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.645
Okay. Not a problem.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.645
We got this.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.647
But listen, I mean it

21:11.729 --> 21:13.647
in the nicest way.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.733
I know, man, I know.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.733
Only if you guys

21:13.731 --> 21:15.733
are into it.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.818
Business first,

21:15.816 --> 21:17.818
then we party.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.818
You got it.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.695
All right, Julian.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.695
All right.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.697
You're the

21:19.779 --> 21:21.697
fucking coolest.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.950
Thanks, man.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.950
This is going

21:21.781 --> 21:23.950
to be wicked.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.077
(Shrieking)

21:24.033 --> 21:26.077
Sweet mother of fuck!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.870
What are you guys

21:26.160 --> 21:27.870
doing here?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
You guys made it

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
to my house!

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
We made it.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.166
Sebastian:

21:30.248 --> 21:32.166
Oh, my God, dude,

21:30.248 --> 21:32.166
where the hell

21:32.250 --> 21:34.127
did you get that

21:32.250 --> 21:34.127
fucking outfit?

21:34.210 --> 21:36.087
What, from

21:34.210 --> 21:36.087
Stompin' Tom Connors?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.756
No, that's a Manuel.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.756
Are you kidding me?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.466
From Nashville?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.466
Yes, sir.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.093
Dudes, I'm so happy

21:42.176 --> 21:44.262
you're here,

21:42.176 --> 21:44.262
man, really.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.262
Tell me about it.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.264
This is fucking

21:44.344 --> 21:46.264
unbelievable.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.264
This is crazy.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.723
Is this your crib?

21:46.346 --> 21:47.723
This is my

21:46.346 --> 21:47.723
crib, man.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.268
Come on over and

21:47.807 --> 21:50.268
meet my lovely

21:47.807 --> 21:50.268
wife, Suzanne,

21:50.350 --> 21:52.603
and her lovely friends

21:50.350 --> 21:52.603
who are here to...

21:52.686 --> 21:55.064
(Mixed greetings)

21:52.686 --> 21:55.064
party with you guys.

21:55.148 --> 21:58.151
I'm going to light up

21:55.148 --> 21:58.151
a fucking spliffadio.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.485
Yeah, so, dude,

21:59.568 --> 22:00.903
what is with

21:59.568 --> 22:00.903
the guitar?

22:01.862 --> 22:04.031
Well, I was...

22:01.862 --> 22:04.031
Julian:

22:01.862 --> 22:04.031
Let me take

22:01.862 --> 22:04.031
care of this.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.741
He wants to shoot

22:04.115 --> 22:05.741
a video, right?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.244
He wants a music video

22:05.825 --> 22:08.244
and we thought

22:05.825 --> 22:08.244
we'd do it here.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.956
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

22:08.327 --> 22:11.956
You want to shoot a music

22:08.327 --> 22:11.956
video at my house?

22:12.039 --> 22:14.000
Well, just some clips

22:12.039 --> 22:14.000
maybe if you're...

22:14.083 --> 22:15.793
I mean, do you

22:14.083 --> 22:15.793
think you would...

22:14.083 --> 22:15.793
Hang on, man.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.503
Do you think

22:15.876 --> 22:17.503
you could be

22:15.876 --> 22:17.503
in my video?

22:20.047 --> 22:21.882
I have to fucking think

22:20.047 --> 22:21.882
about this for a second.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.135
Even if we had

22:21.966 --> 22:24.135
one shot of you

22:21.966 --> 22:24.135
in the video...

22:24.218 --> 22:26.304
So you want me

22:24.218 --> 22:26.304
to be in your video

22:26.386 --> 22:28.973
and you want to shoot

22:26.386 --> 22:28.973
your video at my house?

22:26.386 --> 22:28.973
Well, if it's not

22:29.056 --> 22:31.017
too much to ask.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.017
Yeah, and you've got

22:29.056 --> 22:31.017
celebs here and stuff.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.350
There are some

22:31.100 --> 22:32.350
celebs here,

22:32.434 --> 22:33.894
and the beautiful

22:32.434 --> 22:33.894
thing is,

22:33.978 --> 22:35.479
they're on

22:33.978 --> 22:35.479
my fucking payroll,

22:35.562 --> 22:37.023
so you can

22:35.562 --> 22:37.023
make them do

22:37.106 --> 22:38.858
whatever you

22:37.106 --> 22:38.858
want to do.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.858
What?

22:37.106 --> 22:38.858
No way!

22:38.941 --> 22:40.318
Sebastian:

22:38.941 --> 22:40.318
That's how I roll,

22:38.941 --> 22:40.318
that's how I do it.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.777
But the thing is,

22:40.400 --> 22:41.777
if I'm going to be

22:41.861 --> 22:43.487
in your music video...

22:41.861 --> 22:43.487
Yeah?

22:43.570 --> 22:44.947
I'm... I'm going

22:43.570 --> 22:44.947
to need half...

22:45.031 --> 22:47.074
half the publishing

22:45.031 --> 22:47.074
of the song.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.243
The pub...

22:47.158 --> 22:49.243
I think I...

22:49.327 --> 22:51.662
Pretty sure I gave

22:49.327 --> 22:51.662
that to Alex Lifeson.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.540
Half of it. I mean,

22:51.745 --> 22:54.540
I guess you could

22:51.745 --> 22:54.540
have the other half.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.791
You already gave away

22:55.875 --> 22:57.168
half the publishing

22:55.875 --> 22:57.168
of the song?

22:57.251 --> 22:59.003
Well, Alex Lifeson

22:57.251 --> 22:59.003
plays on the song...

23:00.504 --> 23:02.882
Okay, fuck it.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.882
I'll take

23:00.504 --> 23:02.882
three quarters.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.424
All right.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.424
Right on.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.718
All right.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.718
That's a...

23:05.801 --> 23:07.845
that's a good deal

23:05.801 --> 23:07.845
for me, I believe.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.096
Just don't

23:07.928 --> 23:09.096
sign anything.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.264
Where do you want

23:09.180 --> 23:10.264
to shoot, Bubs?

23:10.348 --> 23:11.598
Bubbles:

23:10.348 --> 23:11.598
I don't know.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.100
Dude, there's so

23:11.682 --> 23:13.100
many cool places

23:13.184 --> 23:14.392
here to shoot,

23:13.184 --> 23:14.392
right?

23:14.476 --> 23:15.728
Let's show him around.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.937
It's amazing.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.937
Come on.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.815
Decent!

23:17.021 --> 23:19.815
Holy fuck!

23:19.899 --> 23:21.483
Sebastian:

23:19.899 --> 23:21.483
Look at this!

23:19.899 --> 23:21.483
Look at these views!

23:21.567 --> 23:22.818
How are you

23:21.567 --> 23:22.818
doing?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.153
What's your name?

23:24.237 --> 23:25.487
(Giggling)

23:25.571 --> 23:26.989
Sebastian:

23:25.571 --> 23:26.989
Look at this,

23:25.571 --> 23:26.989
dude, over here.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.741
Let me show you

23:27.073 --> 23:28.741
something really cool.

23:28.824 --> 23:32.203
This is a meteor...

23:28.824 --> 23:32.203
from space!

23:32.286 --> 23:33.662
Bubbles:

23:32.286 --> 23:33.662
Holy fuck, is

23:32.286 --> 23:33.662
that the meteor?

23:33.746 --> 23:36.874
Dude... all I

23:33.746 --> 23:36.874
can say to you

23:36.957 --> 23:38.584
is that how

23:36.957 --> 23:38.584
many meteors

23:38.667 --> 23:41.628
have you seen

23:38.667 --> 23:41.628
today from space?

23:41.712 --> 23:43.214
Various:

23:41.712 --> 23:43.214
Not many, man.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.214
That's unbelievable.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.632
That was flying

23:43.297 --> 23:45.632
around in space!

23:43.297 --> 23:45.632
It really was,

23:45.716 --> 23:47.425
and the thing is,

23:45.716 --> 23:47.425
you know,

23:47.509 --> 23:48.802
we paid a little

23:47.509 --> 23:48.802
extra for it.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.346
We paid like a million,

23:48.886 --> 23:50.346
right, honey?

23:50.428 --> 23:52.056
Just about.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.056
We paid a million.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.724
Various:

23:52.139 --> 23:53.724
A million bucks?

23:52.139 --> 23:53.724
It's really not much

23:53.807 --> 23:55.309
after the song

23:53.807 --> 23:55.309
"Youth Gone Wild",

23:55.393 --> 23:58.562
but the thing is,

23:55.393 --> 23:58.562
is that I could've

23:55.393 --> 23:58.562
got a meteor

23:58.645 --> 24:01.607
for, like, 60 grand.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.607
Julian:

23:58.645 --> 24:01.607
Yeah.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.900
This was a million though

24:02.983 --> 24:04.735
because this meteor

24:04.818 --> 24:07.405
comes from

24:04.818 --> 24:07.405
a part of space

24:07.487 --> 24:09.031
that's harder

24:07.487 --> 24:09.031
to get to

24:09.115 --> 24:11.784
than the other

24:09.115 --> 24:11.784
parts of space.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.660
Wow.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.660
Cool.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.660
Decent!

24:13.744 --> 24:16.038
That's why it was worth...

24:13.744 --> 24:16.038
like, a million bucks.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.124
Like a galaxy far,

24:16.122 --> 24:18.124
far away, this is.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.000
How would you fucking

24:18.207 --> 24:20.000
like to have this

24:20.084 --> 24:22.086
in your fucking video?

24:22.169 --> 24:24.046
Yeah, yeah!

24:22.169 --> 24:24.046
Could we?

24:22.169 --> 24:24.046
Could I get a shot

24:24.130 --> 24:26.132
in front of that?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.132
This is rock.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.926
Real rock.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.926
You know how

24:26.215 --> 24:28.926
to make videos.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.428
Yeah.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.428
You know what?

24:31.929 --> 24:34.472
Let's shoot a

24:31.929 --> 24:34.472
motherfucking

24:31.929 --> 24:34.472
rock video!

24:34.556 --> 24:37.351
(Laughing)

24:34.556 --> 24:37.351
You know what

24:34.556 --> 24:37.351
she said?

24:37.435 --> 24:40.020
She said, "Only call me

24:37.435 --> 24:40.020
tripod for one reason."

24:40.104 --> 24:43.065
(Groaning)

24:40.104 --> 24:43.065
(Laughing)

24:43.149 --> 24:46.110
Yeah, baby.

24:43.149 --> 24:46.110
Oh, my gosh,

24:43.149 --> 24:46.110
that's too much.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.611
(Flatly)

24:46.193 --> 24:47.611

And who's ready here?

24:51.115 --> 24:52.992

24:53.075 --> 24:56.036
Who's ready to shoot

24:53.075 --> 24:56.036

24:56.120 --> 24:58.414

24:56.120 --> 24:58.414
overtones?

24:58.496 --> 25:01.208
Are you ready?

24:58.496 --> 25:01.208
Sounds wicked.

24:58.496 --> 25:01.208
