WEBVTT

00:01.996 --> 00:04.117
Why do you want to take *?

00:04.203 --> 00:06.832
Well, I agreed to perform
in a musical requiem.

00:06.934 --> 00:11.005
I hope you don't think I'm a slut.
Josephine was sleeping with you immediately?

00:11.092 --> 00:12.905
I just want to know if
I can keep this up.

00:12.993 --> 00:15.184
Listen, I don't want us to stop.

00:15.646 --> 00:17.059
That's okay, baby.

00:17.153 --> 00:19.681
I'm not very available emotionally.

00:19.768 --> 00:22.339
And I have a long track
record of being let down.

00:22.415 --> 00:24.931
If anyone knows anything
about the Hudson sperm bank

00:25.023 --> 00:27.292
that went up in flames in
Fairmont, New Jersey,

00:27.371 --> 00:29.645
in 1981, please, help me.

Is that your car?

02:06.438 --> 02:09.076
I don't like German cars.
I'm a survivor.

02:09.143 --> 02:11.146
It's a friend's car.
You're a holocaust survivor?

02:11.180 --> 02:13.651
No, in general I'm a survivor.

02:13.685 --> 02:15.888
- I haven't had it easy.
- Right.

02:15.923 --> 02:19.060
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
I'm a private detective.

02:19.095 --> 02:22.901
Do you remember the sperm bank next
door that went up in flames in 1981?

02:22.935 --> 02:25.037
That storefront
semen dealership?

02:25.072 --> 02:26.607
How could I forget it?

02:26.641 --> 02:28.877
My furs were smoky for months.

02:28.912 --> 02:30.747
Do you know what became of
the manager after the fire?

02:30.782 --> 02:33.452
He disappeared.
Had a gambling problem.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.789
And terrible breath.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.459
I always kept my distance.

02:37.493 --> 02:39.696
Hmm.
Next question.

02:39.730 --> 02:42.701
Do you recall a man who
may have looked just like me

02:42.735 --> 02:44.904
who made a deposit at the bank,
and if so, do you know his name?

02:44.938 --> 02:46.673
What, are you nuts?

02:50.981 --> 02:53.985
- Patti?
- My sweet first love.

02:55.489 --> 02:57.056
Why are you wearing
a mink stole?

02:57.091 --> 02:59.927
It's for my mother.
Ts furrier I met gave me a big discount.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.465
- But what are you doing here?
- We need your help.

03:02.499 --> 03:05.102
Daddy, this is Jonathan.

03:05.136 --> 03:07.439
He's the private detective
I think you should hire.

03:07.474 --> 03:09.476
Henry Stevenson.

03:09.510 --> 03:12.780
- Strong grip.
- Thank you, I've been working on it.

03:12.815 --> 03:15.017
I'm really glad you guys
are finally meeting.

03:15.051 --> 03:17.821
I took Jonathan's virginity
at Princeton and he took mine.

03:17.856 --> 03:20.626
Yes, dear, I remember vividly

03:20.660 --> 03:22.662
the letter you wrote about it.

03:22.696 --> 03:26.300
But it's good to put
a face to that story.

03:27.336 --> 03:28.971
Nice mink.

03:29.006 --> 03:30.240
Thank you.

03:30.274 --> 03:32.610
It makes me feel
very "Doctor Zhivago."

03:32.644 --> 03:35.614
How does the back feel, kiddo?

03:35.649 --> 03:38.786
Not good. I was thinking about
going to a chiropractor.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.688
Been saving up my money for it.

03:40.723 --> 03:43.292
Don't bother.
Those guys are quacks.

03:43.326 --> 03:45.896
Let me try a little
acupressure there.

03:47.733 --> 03:49.367
Okay okay, ow ow ow.

03:49.401 --> 03:50.903
Okay, good good.
Ow ow.

03:50.937 --> 03:53.773
- Did that help?
- Yeah, a little.

03:55.310 --> 03:57.778
Can we play "looking for
the sunken treasure again"?

03:57.813 --> 03:59.746
Oh, you're naughty.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.882
All right-- The divers
were looking

04:02.916 --> 04:07.485
for the treasure
of the Spanish galleon.

04:07.519 --> 04:11.455
Then one diver cried out,

04:11.489 --> 04:14.757
"I found two large pearls

04:14.791 --> 04:17.024
and a bar of gold."

04:17.059 --> 04:18.759
- <i>- Ray, I'm coming in.</i>
- Oh God! Jeez!

04:18.793 --> 04:20.625
What the hell is going on?

04:20.661 --> 04:23.728
I can explain. I was taking a
bath, the window was open--

04:23.763 --> 04:25.930
We committed adultery!

04:25.964 --> 04:28.765
I used to be a good
woman but I weakened.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.967
Forgive me!

04:31.001 --> 04:33.769
Hail Mary, full of grace...

04:33.804 --> 04:36.507
Ray, who is this woman

04:36.541 --> 04:40.044
and why did she say anything
about adultery?

04:40.078 --> 04:42.245
Did you know that Picasso
lived with two women?

04:42.280 --> 04:44.848
Have you ever considered the
possibility of maybe having

04:44.883 --> 04:47.216
a more unconventional
relationship?

05:03.763 --> 05:06.164
To unexpected
10-year reunions.

05:06.199 --> 05:08.833
- Patti, you look great.
- So do you.

05:08.868 --> 05:11.469
Your mole is bigger and cuter.

05:11.503 --> 05:14.638
- That's enough, Patti. You're getting married.
- To Josh?

05:14.672 --> 05:18.241
- Oh no, I haven't seen Josh in years.
- Who's Josh?

05:18.275 --> 05:20.176
Oh, he's the boy I left
Jonathan for sophomore year.

05:20.210 --> 05:23.078
The one who shot the
pornographic videos of you?

05:23.113 --> 05:26.114
Yes. Anyway, Jonathan,
we're looking for someone

05:26.148 --> 05:28.282
to guard my wedding necklace
tonight and I thought of you.

05:28.317 --> 05:31.385
It's an old Philadelphia
family heirloom.

05:31.419 --> 05:33.720
It's worth $125,000.

05:33.755 --> 05:35.955
Well, jewel guarding
shouldn't be a problem.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.391
I never lose my sunglasses.

05:39.926 --> 05:41.627
And most people do.

05:41.661 --> 05:44.296
Well...

05:44.331 --> 05:47.032
Patti tells me you were
on the Cavett show,

05:47.066 --> 05:48.767
so you must be good.

05:48.801 --> 05:50.968
Come to the Sword &
Shield club tonight

05:51.003 --> 05:54.205
during the rehearsal dinner
and we'll set you up there.

05:54.239 --> 05:56.907
Thank you for doing this.

05:56.941 --> 05:59.676
I haven't forgotten our pact.

06:05.548 --> 06:07.749
Oh, George.

06:07.783 --> 06:09.951
Come back.
Don't be upset.

06:09.985 --> 06:12.753
I still think
you're a wonderful lover.

06:12.787 --> 06:15.923
- You do?
- Of course.

06:15.957 --> 06:17.590
Oh.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.793
Well, that's a relief.

06:20.828 --> 06:23.062
I don't care if you
can't get an erection.

06:23.096 --> 06:24.763
No no.

06:24.798 --> 06:26.531
Don't say that.
No.

06:26.566 --> 06:29.934
I couldn't perform
because I have mental issues.

06:29.969 --> 06:33.170
Oh, Georgie, I'm sorry.
Tell me all about it.

06:33.205 --> 06:35.339
Well, to be frank,

06:35.373 --> 06:38.675
I'm worried about you
getting attached.

06:38.710 --> 06:41.444
And that worry finds
its way down below,

06:41.479 --> 06:44.614
- if you know what I mean.
- But I am already attached.

06:44.648 --> 06:48.284
When I sleep with someone
five times, we're an item.

06:48.318 --> 06:51.586
Yeah, but see, it was only four
times since I fell short today.

06:51.621 --> 06:53.255
Well, today counts.

06:53.289 --> 06:56.024
I told you
that I'm not available.

06:58.860 --> 07:01.629
I don't believe you.

07:06.701 --> 07:08.568
Oh!

07:08.602 --> 07:11.037
Oh, I think I'm rallying.

07:11.071 --> 07:13.639
You are definitely rallying.

07:15.665 --> 07:20.845
Oh, shit! Hold that thought.

07:26.851 --> 07:30.386
Leah broke up with me.

07:30.421 --> 07:32.789
She caught Belinda giving
me a bubble bath..

07:32.823 --> 07:36.558
Oh, so sorry, my dear boy.

07:38.328 --> 07:39.995
George, who are we hugging?

07:40.029 --> 07:42.563
This is my friend Ray.

07:42.598 --> 07:45.399
George, is your
hip bone protruding?

07:45.433 --> 07:47.634
Shh.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.606
I had the restaurant
send up roast beef sandwiches.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.576
It's always good in a crisis to
numb one's feelings with food.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.111
I can't eat.
I'm inconsolable.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.047
Oh, sorry, little buddy.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.982
Would it console you
to hear my problems?

08:05.017 --> 08:08.285
Schadenfreude is supposed
to be very healthy for you.

08:08.319 --> 08:11.621
It makes us feel like we're
gonna survive as others fail.

08:11.655 --> 08:13.923
Not in the mood
for "shocken-frau."

08:13.957 --> 08:15.958
I just hurt
two beautiful women.

08:15.992 --> 08:18.026
Would it make you feel better
to come with me on my case?

08:18.061 --> 08:21.096
I have to guard the wedding necklace
of my sex-crazed college girlfriend.

08:21.130 --> 08:24.031
- Can we smoke and drink?
- Um...

08:24.066 --> 08:26.834
I want to come.
Can we wear outfits?

08:46.384 --> 08:48.952
- Jonathan. - Patti, these are
my friends George and Ray.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.920
They're helping me guard
your jewels tonight.

08:50.954 --> 08:54.123
Fun. A threesome.
I always loved your friends in college.

08:54.157 --> 08:56.124
Jonathan had friends
in college?

08:56.159 --> 08:59.294
Ahem. So your father's inside?
Should we go in?

08:59.328 --> 09:01.029
Do you mind if I have a
moment alone with Jonathan?

09:01.064 --> 09:03.064
- Oh course not. We'll be right inside.
- Yeah.

09:03.099 --> 09:05.900
She does seem
sex-crazed.

09:05.934 --> 09:08.769
Yes yes, very appealing.

09:08.803 --> 09:10.170
You don't remember
our pact, do you?

09:10.204 --> 09:12.772
I-- I don't
remember.

09:12.806 --> 09:15.774
We swore that wherever
our separate lives took us,

09:15.809 --> 09:18.410
before we got married,
you and I would meet again

09:18.444 --> 09:20.145
one last time and make love.

09:20.179 --> 09:23.514
- What? We really said that?
- Yes, it was very romantic.

09:23.548 --> 09:25.649
I can't believe
you don't remember.

09:25.683 --> 09:28.118
- Well...
- You still smoke a lot of pot?

09:28.152 --> 09:30.053
Every day, but not a lot.

09:30.087 --> 09:32.622
Anyway, I'm getting
married tomorrow, so...

09:35.025 --> 09:38.225
I have OCD. When I make any kind of pact
I have to follow through!

09:38.427 --> 09:40.962
- What about your fiance?
- We're staying at separated hotels.

09:40.996 --> 09:42.763
And it's bad luck to see each other
the night before the wedding.

09:42.798 --> 09:45.633
Don't you think it's even worse
luck to sleep with an ex-boyfriend?

09:45.667 --> 09:47.367
Just meet me
in the library at midnight.

09:47.402 --> 09:49.736
We'll discuss it more then.
I have to get back in.

09:50.905 --> 09:52.338
Patti!

09:55.609 --> 09:57.343
It's funny, my daughter
is also engaged,

09:57.377 --> 09:59.512
but it's a very
very dark affair.

09:59.546 --> 10:01.781
- Right.
- Mr. Stevenson, I'm sorry.

10:01.815 --> 10:04.517
I was outside with Patti
familiarizing myself

10:04.551 --> 10:06.319
with the perimeter.

10:06.353 --> 10:09.989
I am going to go and
mingle and drink a lot.

10:13.692 --> 10:17.395
Well, your friends were kind enough
to introduce themselves to me,

10:17.430 --> 10:21.031
but I thought you'd be alone.

10:21.065 --> 10:24.200
Oh well, we often
work cases together.

10:24.234 --> 10:26.735
And why is it you're all
dressed as longshoremen?

10:26.769 --> 10:28.536
No no no, these are
guard outfits.

10:28.571 --> 10:30.537
We just picked them up
at J. Crew.

10:30.572 --> 10:32.439
My design actually.
If you'd let that out--

10:32.473 --> 10:34.073
- Do not do that, please.
- All right.

10:34.108 --> 10:35.908
- George likes to play dress-up.
- Well...

10:35.942 --> 10:38.710
But only in men's clothing,
which is positive.

10:38.744 --> 10:41.279
The jewels are in that case, Mr.
Stevenson?

10:41.313 --> 10:43.280
Yes.

10:45.717 --> 10:47.284
Ooh.

10:47.318 --> 10:50.954
We've set up a room
for you upstairs.

10:50.988 --> 10:53.755
We'll be back in the
morning for the ceremony.

10:53.790 --> 10:57.359
But may I have a word
with you in private?

10:57.394 --> 11:00.596
Your associates are odd.

11:03.132 --> 11:05.033
Are you sure
you're up for this?

11:05.067 --> 11:07.535
I know they don't make
the best first impression,

11:07.569 --> 11:09.703
but everything will be fine.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.638
We brought walkie-talkies.
We're total professionals.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.140
Copy that.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.610
I mean she's beautiful,
but I don't think I can do it.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.845
I don't want to wreck her
marriage before she's married.

11:20.879 --> 11:22.813
She must be having cold feet.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.648
She claims it's OCD.

11:24.682 --> 11:26.316
I don't know why
she wants me again.

11:26.350 --> 11:29.485
Just about every time we had sex
I had a premature ejaculation.

11:29.519 --> 11:32.021
- You ever try a rubber band? That's what I do.
- No.

11:32.055 --> 11:35.490
Did you attend to her
orally to compensate?

11:35.525 --> 11:38.126
- Hello.
- No, I didn't know you could do that back then.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.894
I was only a freshman.

11:39.962 --> 11:41.595
War!

11:41.630 --> 11:43.497
Well, maybe she's doing this

11:43.531 --> 11:46.233
because she regrets
losing you all these years.

11:46.267 --> 11:48.702
Why did it end with you two?

11:48.736 --> 11:50.603
She said I was self-absorbed
and emotionally unavailable.

11:50.638 --> 11:51.938
It's what every girl
has ever told me.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.907
That's what Leah would say.
God, I miss her.

11:54.942 --> 11:58.844
I promised Josephine emotional
inadequacy right from the start.

11:58.878 --> 12:01.546
It's a low bar, but it's one
that I'm comfortable with.

12:01.580 --> 12:04.015
Why aren't we
emotionally available?

12:04.049 --> 12:06.417
We are, just not to women.

12:06.451 --> 12:08.752
That's true.

12:08.786 --> 12:12.455
Well, better go meet her and
try and talk my way out of it.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.157
- We're not done playing war.
- <i>Come on, Ray.</i>

12:14.191 --> 12:15.458
You know that war never ends.

12:15.492 --> 12:17.593
But I'm ahead.
I have all the kings.

12:27.436 --> 12:29.736
Over here, lover.

12:34.941 --> 12:36.575
Patti...

12:36.609 --> 12:38.476
We can't do this.

12:38.511 --> 12:40.678
I-I-I know that
you're having cold feet,

12:40.712 --> 12:42.313
which is totally normal,

12:42.347 --> 12:44.381
but sleeping with me
is not the answer.

12:44.416 --> 12:45.883
You're right
about the cold feet,

12:45.917 --> 12:47.751
but sleeping with you will help
me decide if I should marry Gabe.

12:47.786 --> 12:49.452
You're saying "if" the
night before your wedding?

12:49.487 --> 12:51.587
- Yes, and I want to do this.
- But why me?

12:51.622 --> 12:53.155
- It's been so long.
- 'Cause of our pact.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.057
And because if I
approached anyone else

12:55.091 --> 12:57.359
it would seem slutty and crazy.

12:57.393 --> 13:00.195
Not to be rude, but it seems a little
slutty and crazy to <i>me.</i>

13:00.229 --> 13:02.130
Jonathan, you took
my virginity.

13:02.164 --> 13:04.532
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

13:04.566 --> 13:07.235
Of course it does.

13:11.038 --> 13:13.406
So if we did this,
I'd be helping you?

13:13.440 --> 13:15.274
Yes.

13:18.912 --> 13:21.546
My future happiness
depends on you.

13:28.753 --> 13:30.854
Why don't you read to me
what you have so far?

13:30.888 --> 13:32.222
Okay. It's just
a first draft.

13:32.256 --> 13:33.590
"Dear Leah,"

13:33.624 --> 13:35.325
I have something
called 'elder love.'

13:35.359 --> 13:37.593
that's why I fell for Belinda.

13:37.627 --> 13:41.062
"The benefit is that I will never
leave you as you get older."

13:41.096 --> 13:42.997
You know, I-- Sorry.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.299
I'm not sure this is
the right approach.

13:46.634 --> 13:48.201
Okay, let me just--

13:48.235 --> 13:50.236
"So please take me back."

13:50.270 --> 13:53.272
Belinda's son took her to a
convent in the catskills.

13:53.306 --> 13:55.773
I will be a good man
from now on." All right?

13:55.808 --> 13:59.642
You know, there's a lot of
mention of Belinda in this note.

13:59.677 --> 14:02.978
Why-- why don't you
do a drawing?

14:03.012 --> 14:04.646
I mean, that's where
your strength lies.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.681
A drawing's not gonna work.

14:06.715 --> 14:10.217
I had the most beautiful girl in the
world and I just wrecked everything.

14:10.252 --> 14:12.886
Sorry, Ray.

14:12.921 --> 14:14.420
What am I gonna do?

14:14.455 --> 14:16.989
I'm broke, I'm homeless,
I'm unlovable.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.325
That is not true.
You are not unlovable.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.495
And you're--
you're not homeless either.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.498
You can stay with me
as long as you need to.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.234
Can I eat in
the restaurant for free?

14:30.504 --> 14:31.771
Of course.

14:31.805 --> 14:34.273
I'm lucky to have you
as a friend.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.776
Thank you.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.078
Is this-- Is this what
you called "elder love"?

14:40.112 --> 14:42.347
You're sick.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.949
Don't talk to me like that again.
Do you understand me?

14:53.725 --> 14:55.758
Mm-Mmm.
Nope.

14:55.793 --> 14:57.726
Patti, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

14:57.761 --> 15:00.361
I've never had
this problem before.

15:00.396 --> 15:03.030
But the briefcase
is throwing me off.

15:03.065 --> 15:06.900
- Don't blame the briefcase. You can do this.
- I know, but--

15:06.935 --> 15:08.902
My friend George was talking
about impotence earlier

15:08.937 --> 15:10.437
and he passed it along
to me mentally.

15:10.472 --> 15:13.140
- You know, like auto-suggestion.
- Shut up and try again.

15:13.174 --> 15:15.809
But I feel conflicted
and I've had a long day.

15:15.843 --> 15:18.677
I haven't had a chance to tell
you, but somewhat related,

15:18.712 --> 15:20.912
I come from a sperm donor.

15:20.947 --> 15:24.249
- I'm trying to find my father.
- What?

15:24.284 --> 15:26.751
<i>Jonathan, come in.
</i> <i>It's George.</i>

15:26.786 --> 15:30.088
<i>Sorry to interrupt,</i> <i>but the lights
have gone out</i> <i>and Ray is scared.</i>

15:30.122 --> 15:31.656
- <i>- Don't say that.</i>
- <i>Sorry.</i>

15:31.690 --> 15:33.557
It's an old house.
A fuse must have blown.

15:33.591 --> 15:35.525
Got to find the circuit breaker.
Over.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.060
Yeah, he thinks
it's a circuit breaker.

15:37.094 --> 15:38.494
George, I'm standing
right here.

15:38.529 --> 15:40.830
It's not like you're having
a private conversation.

15:40.864 --> 15:44.199
I'll tell you what-- We'll go
find the circuit breaker. Over.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.967
Oh hey,

15:46.002 --> 15:48.369
are you having sex with
Patti or did you resist?

15:48.403 --> 15:50.004
Sorry.
Ahem.

15:50.038 --> 15:52.539
Just find the fuse, we'll make
our way back to the base.

15:52.573 --> 15:54.874
- Over.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

15:54.909 --> 15:56.409
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>they're having sex.</i>

15:56.443 --> 16:00.145
<i>George, take your
finger</i> <i>off the button.</i>

16:10.055 --> 16:11.688
Wow.

16:11.723 --> 16:15.391
Lions, tigers and bears.

16:15.425 --> 16:17.326
Oh my.

16:17.361 --> 16:19.662
Okay, here we go.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.330
All right.

16:22.364 --> 16:25.666
This looks like a fuse box
of some kind.

16:28.303 --> 16:30.571
Oh dear.

16:30.605 --> 16:32.072
I'm sorry I let you down.

16:32.107 --> 16:34.041
There's still time.
We can try again.

16:34.075 --> 16:36.943
But I can't--

16:41.615 --> 16:43.549
Come on, let's get out of here.

16:48.487 --> 16:51.222
- Ray.
- Sorry.

16:51.256 --> 16:53.057
Whoa whoa whoa.

16:53.091 --> 16:55.459
You go, I'll hold him off. Go!

16:57.795 --> 16:59.962
Stay back!

17:01.865 --> 17:04.900
Shit.
I must warn you,

17:04.934 --> 17:07.234
I fenced at Princeton.

17:12.107 --> 17:14.008
Oh my God.

17:14.041 --> 17:16.810
I'm so sorry. That never happened
to me in competitive fencing.

17:16.845 --> 17:19.311
Wait!
Sorry.

17:19.346 --> 17:21.480
Don't--

17:28.155 --> 17:30.956
Jonathan, we found the circuit breaker.
Who are you playing with?

17:30.990 --> 17:32.725
What?

17:32.759 --> 17:34.893
No!

17:43.635 --> 17:46.337
- Stay back, asshole.
- George!

17:46.371 --> 17:48.272
All right.
There, huh?

17:48.306 --> 17:51.241
Okay, yeah. Jonathan, look at me.
Look at me.

17:53.945 --> 17:55.412
Ooh, jeez.

17:57.147 --> 17:59.982
- It's stuck.
- Come on!

18:00.016 --> 18:02.151
Help, someone.
Wait wait!

18:11.126 --> 18:13.527
Shit.

18:13.561 --> 18:15.562
A black man can't catch
a cab in this town,

18:15.629 --> 18:19.031
but a guy with a sword,
no problem.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.375
Your dad is gonna kill me.

18:31.409 --> 18:34.177
I'll tell him you tried your
best, that you were very brave.

18:34.212 --> 18:36.046
You still have his briefcase.
That's something.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.515
Yeah, you know what? I think we shouldn't
talk about the marijuana and the beer.

18:39.549 --> 18:41.984
I think that would not
be a good idea.

18:43.986 --> 18:46.988
- I'm just saying we should look--
- Stop.

18:47.022 --> 18:49.256
Jonathan?

18:49.290 --> 18:51.091
Patti...?

18:51.125 --> 18:52.358
What's going on?

18:52.392 --> 18:53.993
We need to talk.
Can we come in?

18:54.027 --> 18:57.329
Your mother is sleeping,
so if you keep it down.

18:57.363 --> 18:59.597
I hope it's nothing serious.

18:59.632 --> 19:01.832
Your briefcase is fine.
Don't worry.

19:08.439 --> 19:11.674
How on Earth
could this possibly happen?

19:11.709 --> 19:15.277
Well, um, he was a very
sophisticated burglar.

19:15.312 --> 19:17.045
He turned the lights off
and everything.

19:17.113 --> 19:21.315
- And he was wearing a mask.
- With holes in it.

19:21.350 --> 19:23.550
Jonathan was very heroic.
He tried to stop him.

19:23.585 --> 19:25.986
But I'm really sorry
I failed you, Mr. Stevenson.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.254
No no, sorry doesn't cut it.

19:28.288 --> 19:32.357
That necklace has been in
our family for 150 years.

19:32.392 --> 19:36.361
Now I'm gonna have to call the
police, my insurance company.

19:36.428 --> 19:39.597
Excuse me, but I think
you have a red pen

19:39.631 --> 19:41.499
leaking ink in your robe.

19:41.533 --> 19:43.367
What?

19:45.303 --> 19:47.304
Oh, this?

19:48.406 --> 19:50.006
I cut myself shaving.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.774
Really?
That happened to me.

19:51.808 --> 19:54.843
I was shaving my side belly hair so I
could wear a girdle and I nicked myself.

19:54.878 --> 19:57.145
And that's what happened
to you, Mr. Stevenson?

19:57.180 --> 19:59.981
- You were shaving your side belly hairs?
- I, uh...

20:00.015 --> 20:03.050
Or did somebody shave you with
his saber in that exact spot?

20:03.085 --> 20:05.119
- <i>J'accuse!</i>
- Uh...

20:05.153 --> 20:08.621
Oh my God.
Daddy, why?

20:08.655 --> 20:11.224
For you, sweetheart.

20:11.258 --> 20:12.892
For the insurance money.

20:12.926 --> 20:15.427
It's the only way
I can afford the wedding.

20:15.461 --> 20:17.762
Once you introduced me
to Jonathan

20:17.797 --> 20:19.430
I knew I could pull it off.

20:19.465 --> 20:21.432
Mm-hmm.
Hmm?

20:21.466 --> 20:24.101
- But we have lots of money.
- We don't.

20:24.135 --> 20:27.437
Not until
your grandmother passes.

20:27.471 --> 20:30.906
Everyone in Philadelphia is
waiting for someone to die.

20:30.941 --> 20:34.176
It's what we live for.

20:34.210 --> 20:37.078
- What an honorable man.
- Honorable?

20:37.113 --> 20:39.247
He hired me to fail,
tried to kill me

20:39.282 --> 20:40.815
and he's committing
insurance fraud.

20:40.850 --> 20:42.484
Exactly, all for his daughter.

20:42.518 --> 20:44.419
I mean the man's
a role model for me.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.888
I wonder what I could
steal for Emily.

20:46.923 --> 20:49.658
For Patti's sake I'm willing to turn
a blind eye and not report him,

20:49.693 --> 20:51.493
but it goes against
everything I stand for.

20:51.528 --> 20:54.797
- Such as?
- I don't know, something.

20:55.832 --> 20:58.167
Jonathan, wait.

20:58.201 --> 21:00.736
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up.

21:03.507 --> 21:05.274
Thank you for everything.

21:05.309 --> 21:08.710
You're welcome, but how do you know
I'm not gonna turn your dad in?

21:08.745 --> 21:11.279
I'm thanking you for the pact.
It worked.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.714
But I couldn't, you know...

21:13.748 --> 21:16.483
- Perform.
- No, it's all right.

21:16.517 --> 21:19.819
Your impotence made me realize
how much I want to marry Gabe.

21:19.853 --> 21:21.719
What?

21:25.657 --> 21:28.558
Just hold on one second.

21:28.593 --> 21:30.593
I want to talk to
you about this.

21:30.627 --> 21:32.494
- Hello?
- <i>- Jonathan Ames?</i>

21:32.529 --> 21:35.263
- Yes?
- <i>I saw you on</i> <i>"The Dick Cavett Show."</i>

21:35.298 --> 21:38.799
<i>I have information</i>
<i>about your biological father.</i>

21:38.833 --> 21:40.600
I'm gonna have to take this.

21:44.438 --> 21:46.838
Go ahead.
I'm listening.

21:50.041 --> 21:52.041
- George?
- Mm-hmm.

21:52.076 --> 21:54.009
I have an itch just below
my left shoulder blade.

21:54.044 --> 21:56.111
Can you scratch it for me?
It's driving me nuts.

21:56.145 --> 21:58.979
I think it's a new back
hair trying to pop out.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.048
That's why it's so itchy.

22:06.421 --> 22:07.955
Is that better, little buddy?

22:07.990 --> 22:09.924
I know you've had
a pretty rough day.

22:09.958 --> 22:12.192
A little harder
and to the left.

22:13.393 --> 22:15.861
Aw yeah.

22:15.896 --> 22:17.696
That's it right there.

22:17.764 --> 22:20.932
Okay, now to the right.

22:22.567 --> 22:24.567
To the right.

22:24.601 --> 22:26.902
Go to the <i>right.</i>

22:26.936 --> 22:29.937
To the <i>right,</i> George!
