00:05.964 --> 00:08.425
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:08.509 --> 00:10.552
I am Omoc.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.680
Our world is called Tollan.

00:13.764 --> 00:18.810
I find it unbelievable anyone so primitive
could have deciphered the gate system.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.354
Primitive?

00:20.437 --> 00:23.941
You are, after all, the people
who saved us from the Goa'uld.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.818
In that spirit,
we'd like to arrange for a trade.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.364
- What would you like to trade?
- Technology.

00:30.489 --> 00:33.575
You know that is the one thing
we cannot give you.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.536
Cover!

00:40.123 --> 00:43.961
Narim was right about you.
Perhaps in time we'll meet again.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.597
We should not mourn
the passing of our friend Omoc,

00:55.681 --> 00:58.767
as much as we should
celebrate his existence.

00:58.892 --> 01:03.146
He helped us through one of the greatest
challenges in our people's recent history.

01:03.230 --> 01:08.443
His efforts contributed to the rebirth
of our great nation as it stands today.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.571
He will always be remembered.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.635
Very nice.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.433
Very... intimate.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.729
Councillor Omoc was well aware
that he had very few true friends.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.357
He was not concerned
with trivial relationships.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.277
In his testament
he asked that his memorial

01:50.360 --> 01:53.238
be attended only by those
whom he respected.

01:54.156 --> 01:57.492
No offence, but what are we doing here?

01:57.743 --> 02:02.956
He may not have shown you warmth, but
Omoc had a lot of reverence for all of you.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.711
As do we all.

02:07.794 --> 02:13.884
Colonel O'Neill, we have not dismissed
what you have done for the Tollan people.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.469
Don't mention it.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.805
We appreciate everything
you've done for us, too.

02:18.931 --> 02:23.310
If you are referring to our policy
of not sharing our technology,

02:23.435 --> 02:28.315
renewing such a discussion would be
better suited for another time and place.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.983
Really?

02:31.026 --> 02:36.156
The Tollan curia has recessed for a day
of mourning out of respect for Omoc.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.868
Would you consider returning tomorrow
to meet with me?

02:42.371 --> 02:46.041
- Sure.
- Thank you all for coming today.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.002
I look forward to seeing you
again soon, Colonel.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.716
Narim, will you show
our guests to the Stargate?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.660
Any idea what she was talkin' about?

03:21.785 --> 03:24.621
I was as surprised as you
by her invitation.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.542
She seems to suggest the curia may
now be willing to share its technology.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.296
I doubt that. She merely said
they wished to discuss it with you.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.507
You think she'd invite us back
if things were status quo?

03:35.591 --> 03:40.387
I am not on the curia. I really have no idea
what she wishes to see you about.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.599
Have a safe trip home.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.479
Samantha.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.901
I hope I will have the chance
to see you upon your return.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.594
Sir.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.224
Narim just handed me this.

04:26.975 --> 04:31.855
Samantha, sorry I was unable to tell you
this in person. I do not know who to trust.

04:32.189 --> 04:36.568
Before his death, Omoc gave me
a warning and I believe it to be true.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.737
Earth is in grave danger.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.023
Narim gave no other indication
something might be wrong?

05:56.106 --> 05:59.610
- No, sir. Everything was fine.
- For a funeral.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.613
It did seem strange
there were so few people.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.740
Hey, you knew him.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.575
What's strange?

06:06.700 --> 06:09.328
Whatever he meant, I bet Omoc's warning

06:09.411 --> 06:13.957
has something to do with what
Travell wants to meet with us about.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.503
Agreed. Let's see what they have to say.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.824
Cosy.

06:53.956 --> 06:57.960
Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson,
thank you so much for returning.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.504
Thanks for havin' us.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.423
Are Major Carter and Teal'c not with you?

07:03.549 --> 07:06.176
They want to spend time
catching up with Narim.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.887
Of course.
Shall we get down to business?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.559
The curia met this morning, as I indicated,

07:13.642 --> 07:17.479
and the topic was our policy
of sharing technology with Earth.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.857
In an odd way, Colonel O'Neill,

07:19.940 --> 07:25.237
the unfortunate death of Omoc
has proven to be advantageous for you.

07:26.321 --> 07:31.994
Well, then I guess I'm both sad and happy.

07:32.119 --> 07:39.001
You've often expressed a strong interest
in obtaining some of our technologies.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.962
You could say.

07:42.087 --> 07:46.216
In the past,
the prevailing beliefs of the curia

07:46.300 --> 07:49.469
have made any such
arrangements impossible.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.763
What's this have to do
with Omoc's death?

07:52.264 --> 07:57.644
Some curia members have been changing
their view about our isolationist ways.

07:58.187 --> 08:02.649
Recently, the balance of the votes
on these issues have been split.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.736
Omoc strongly supported the old ways.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.198
With his passing,
those in favour now control the vote.

08:09.281 --> 08:12.117
We would like to propose an exchange.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.828
Ah, the sound of the other shoe.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.498
Please, Colonel, have you ever known
a political body to act solely

08:18.624 --> 08:21.543
without concern for its own needs?

08:24.880 --> 08:29.510
- What do you want?
- We chose this planet for our new home

08:29.593 --> 08:31.803
because of its natural supply of trinium.

08:31.887 --> 08:35.974
However, our nation has grown
much quicker than anyone anticipated.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.101
Resources are becoming depleted.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.770
Always reason to reassess
isolationist ways.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.984
As I said, Dr Jackson, politics have
common threads wherever you go.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.404
OK, so you need trinium.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.573
Why not go get some?

08:54.243 --> 08:56.286
- What did I say?
- I don't know.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.088
I have temporarily deactivated
security in this room.

09:06.171 --> 09:12.427
Normally everything is recorded. I wish to
talk confidentially without repercussions.

09:12.511 --> 09:15.055
- Off the record?
- Yes.

09:15.180 --> 09:19.643
The truth is, Colonel, those councillors
that oppose this arrangement

09:19.726 --> 09:22.396
still have strong voices
among our people.

09:22.479 --> 09:28.402
So the whole trinium thing
is just an excuse to save face publicly?

09:28.527 --> 09:34.366
We do need it but, as you have suggested,
we can get it elsewhere if necessary.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.369
- How much do you need?
- Would you repeat that?

09:42.916 --> 09:45.377
How much do you need?

09:46.670 --> 09:49.423
Our scientists will work out the specifics.

09:49.506 --> 09:53.093
But, given that you now have
an offworld trinium mine,

09:53.218 --> 09:55.888
I am sure it is within your capabilities.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.685
OK. In exchange we get...?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.730
A Tollan ion cannon.

10:07.024 --> 10:11.737
One of those big, honkin' space guns

10:11.820 --> 10:14.656
that shoots Goa'uld ships out of the sky?

10:14.907 --> 10:16.950
Yes.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.495
Cool.

10:29.922 --> 10:33.342
Narim appears to have
strong personal feelings for you.

10:33.425 --> 10:37.179
- I know. It's just that...
- Forgive me, Samantha. Teal'c.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.806
My duties did not allow me
to get away before now.

10:39.932 --> 10:43.435
- It's OK. You all right?
- Yes, fine.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.604
You look concerned.

10:50.234 --> 10:53.403
I apologise for having to send
that message the way I did.

10:53.487 --> 10:57.866
There were so many extra security forces
yesterday, I didn't know who I could trust.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.495
- Except you, of course.
- It's OK. Thank you.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.748
Did Omoc not say any more
about the danger to the Tauri?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.960
All I know is what I said in the message.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.712
Omoc seemed to be
under great strain recently.

11:10.796 --> 11:14.216
Which may explain
why he had the heart attack.

11:14.633 --> 11:18.554
- Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson.
- What did Chancellor Travell say?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.973
She offered us an ion cannon.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.392
- I don't believe it.
- Neither did we.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.979
- In exchange for trinium.
- The curia would never agree to that.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.982
Apparently, Omoc was the swing vote.

11:30.065 --> 11:33.485
But it goes against
everything we've stood for.

11:33.569 --> 11:36.905
Do you think this is
what Omoc was so worried about?

11:36.989 --> 11:39.032
Of course. It must have been.

11:41.076 --> 11:45.956
Another world once destroyed themselves
because we shared technology with them.

11:46.081 --> 11:50.002
That is why we have resisted sharing
what we know with primitive societies.

11:50.127 --> 11:53.213
We'd prefer "less advanced",
if you don't mind.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.674
My apologies. You know what I meant.

11:55.799 --> 12:00.012
If used the wrong way, this ion cannon
could lead you to disaster.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.437
The ion- beam technology
is very advanced.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.984
So much so, that backward- engineering
one for mass production is beyond us.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.154
- And that poses a bigger problem.
- How so?

12:17.237 --> 12:21.325
Well, sir, even strategically placed
in, say, Washington DC,

12:21.408 --> 12:26.288
one ion cannon provides very little range
of defence coverage for a planet our size.

12:26.371 --> 12:31.335
Even if we could mobilise it, a fleet of
Goa'uld motherships could still strike.

12:31.502 --> 12:36.381
And the Russians might take issue with
our having control of a single ion cannon.

12:36.924 --> 12:40.928
Our current relationship with them
on these matters is tenuous at best.

12:41.011 --> 12:44.932
So, at this point, one ion cannon
is likely to cause more harm than good.

12:45.349 --> 12:49.728
How many do we need to set up a proper
protective net around the entire planet?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.150
38. Minimum.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.569
38?

12:57.694 --> 13:00.572
To provide total global coverage, yes, sir.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.659
And that's not including backups.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.662
It couldn't hurt to ask, sir.

13:07.037 --> 13:11.750
Sir, I feel obligated to mention the fact
that Narim is opposed to this exchange,

13:11.834 --> 13:15.504
and thinks that Omoc's warning
was directly related.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.759
Do you believe the Tollan Council
has ulterior motives

13:20.843 --> 13:23.136
that do not represent our best interest?

13:23.637 --> 13:26.807
Something's going on.
I just don't know what.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.814
I'm ordering you
to proceed with the negotiation.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.775
OK.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.946
Colonel, under the circumstances...

13:41.071 --> 13:45.325
If you're going to recommend, sir, I
continue to be suspicious and sceptical...

13:45.409 --> 13:47.870
- I wouldn't waste my time.
- Good thinking.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.914
Remember, this could change
the course of our history.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.375
So don't blow it?

13:53.625 --> 13:58.672
What you're sensing as trouble could be
simple internal political wrangling.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.716
I understand that.

14:02.009 --> 14:06.180
Or we could be walking into a minefield.

14:08.432 --> 14:09.933
Thank you, sir.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.604
These little chats of ours
always bring me great joy

14:13.729 --> 14:16.732
and serve to ease my mind.

14:31.330 --> 14:36.460
Greetings. Chancellor Travell has asked
that I escort them the rest of the way.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.882
- Is that true?
- No. I heard you were back on Tollana

14:41.965 --> 14:44.009
to meet with Chancellor Travell.

14:45.511 --> 14:48.847
Yeah. We're gonna ask for
a whole whack of space guns.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.807
This is worse than I thought.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.728
We understand why you're concerned,
but those cannons could save Earth.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.606
You have to trust
we won't kill each other with them.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.609
And if we do,
we won't blame you. Promise.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.736
You don't understand.

15:03.654 --> 15:07.157
Every Tollan has a small implant
that monitors their health.

15:12.454 --> 15:15.541
- This is my current health data.
- I'm assuming you're OK?

15:15.624 --> 15:17.251
Yes. Pertect health.

15:17.376 --> 15:22.256
However, I am overseer of Omoc's
property, including his health records.

15:22.381 --> 15:25.551
After our last conversation
I did some checking.

15:25.634 --> 15:30.013
- As you know, Omoc had a heart attack.
- Narim, where are you going with this?

15:30.138 --> 15:32.432
Despite the fact...

15:34.852 --> 15:39.314
Despite the fact Omoc looked as if he was
under stress, he too was in pertect health.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.860
People sometimes die
of heart attacks without warning.

15:42.943 --> 15:48.156
Our implants link to a central system. If
anything is wrong officers are dispatched.

15:48.532 --> 15:52.119
Normally, maximum response time
is under five minutes.

15:52.202 --> 15:55.789
The night of Omoc's death
it took them over ten minutes.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.792
- What are you saying?
- That just doesn't happen.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.544
No.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.504
What are you saying?

16:02.921 --> 16:04.965
Well, I believe...

16:08.427 --> 16:10.888
I believe Omoc may have been murdered.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.440
Mind if I ask
what you need the trinium for?

16:21.523 --> 16:25.194
Trinium is combined with a number
of elements to create a compound

16:25.277 --> 16:28.363
that is used
in various Tollan technologies.

16:29.740 --> 16:32.910
Do you people practise being vague?

16:33.035 --> 16:36.622
I will have this sample analysed for purity.

16:36.747 --> 16:41.210
Then I will be able to give you
the amounts we require for our exchange.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.922
Yeah, about that...

16:45.214 --> 16:49.051
- Have you reconsidered?
- No. No, no, no. Um...

16:49.176 --> 16:53.222
We just don't feel
one cannon is gonna work.

16:53.305 --> 16:56.308
One doesn't go so far
in protecting an entire planet.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.477
Yes, that was discussed by the curia.

16:58.769 --> 17:02.606
Well, we've come up with a solution
you may not have considered.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.901
- Yes?
- Give us more than one.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.694
How many would you require?

17:10.364 --> 17:12.741
- Mm, thirty...
- Eight.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.410
Thirty- eight. Total.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.538
I see.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.417
Well, I understand your dilemma.

17:23.544 --> 17:27.548
Please, give me some time
to present your request to the curia.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.806
- That went well.
- Mm- hm.

17:52.114 --> 17:56.034
Greetings, Narim. Welcome home.
Atmosphere control is active.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.829
Shall I prepare a meal
foryou and yourguests?

17:58.912 --> 18:00.789
No, thank you.

18:00.873 --> 18:04.042
- Narim?
- Yes, Samantha.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.086
Is that my voice?

18:06.170 --> 18:09.506
I'm sorry.
I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

18:11.175 --> 18:15.179
Colonel O'Neill asked us
to find proof of Omoc's murder.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.306
Should we not begin?

18:18.432 --> 18:20.392
I don't know where to start.

18:20.475 --> 18:23.729
There hasn't been a murder here
for as long as I can remember.

18:23.854 --> 18:28.233
- Is crime so uncommon here?
- There are crimes of indiscretion,

18:28.317 --> 18:31.820
but nothing even approaching
the severity of murder.

18:33.655 --> 18:38.368
Our security systems prevent it, which is
why I was so reluctant to even suggest it.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.704
This doesn't make any sense.

18:40.829 --> 18:44.249
The curia disagreed with Omoc
over whether to give us your weapons,

18:44.333 --> 18:48.629
but do you really think
they would kill him over it?

18:48.712 --> 18:51.882
I don't know what
to believe any more, Samantha.

18:53.258 --> 18:58.222
The records of all curia meetings are
public. We can read through them here.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.488
There appears to be much information.

19:14.613 --> 19:18.534
Yes, but as Samantha suggested,
maybe there is something in all this

19:18.617 --> 19:22.871
to indicate the seriousness of the conflict
between Omoc and the other members.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.998
Can you translate it for us?

19:34.007 --> 19:36.468
You think Narim's right about Omoc?

19:36.552 --> 19:40.806
I think this thing smells
worse and worse by the minute.

19:40.889 --> 19:44.059
But you're still willing to proceed?

19:44.142 --> 19:47.813
It's the only way we're gonna find out
what's really going on.

19:47.938 --> 19:50.232
The question is, how far do we go?

19:51.525 --> 19:58.031
Well, all we know is these people might
be willing to part with powertul weapons.

19:59.074 --> 20:02.494
- I have no problem with that.
- No. No surprise there.

20:03.787 --> 20:08.917
At worst, some people disagree on some
philosophical level I don't understand.

20:09.001 --> 20:12.337
At worst, they killed someone
to make sure this would happen.

20:12.421 --> 20:15.132
Now, see, that makes no sense to me.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.177
Exactly. So push on blindly, then?

20:18.260 --> 20:20.137
Blindly, yes.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.974
But we still have our slightly
heightened sense of smell.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.644
Chancellor Travell is ready for you now.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.992
Shall we take a break?

20:42.075 --> 20:46.705
Isn't there a way to narrow this down,
search the records for specific topics?

20:46.830 --> 20:49.666
Please indicate the topic ofinterest.

20:49.750 --> 20:53.670
- OK, how do we shut that off?
- Voice system off.

20:53.754 --> 20:57.799
- What do you want to search for?
- Let's start with ion cannons.

20:58.842 --> 21:02.429
OK. Search topic: ion cannons.
Time frame: six months.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.142
Hello?

21:07.267 --> 21:08.977
Hello?

21:09.061 --> 21:13.148
- You sure this is the right spot?
- The directions he gave led us here.

21:13.232 --> 21:17.444
How do you know this is Narim"s house?
They all look the same here.

21:19.238 --> 21:21.281
Cos that's Narim.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.160
- You're good.
- Come in.

21:26.870 --> 21:30.707
- Whatcha readin' there, fella?
- Tollan curia records.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.876
Don't wreck it for me.

21:34.586 --> 21:38.674
- So what did Travell say?
- We got the guns.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.634
It cannot be true.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.971
- All of them?
- Over time, as we deliver the trinium.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.641
- Wow.
- What do you guys got?

21:48.725 --> 21:51.979
Uh, well, so far not much.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.857
Narim. Colonel O'Neill.

22:00.904 --> 22:05.367
It says that two months ago there was an
unscheduled test of Tollan ion cannons.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.494
Omoc filed an official protest.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.913
Yes, I remember it well.

22:09.997 --> 22:14.710
We were supposed to have a meal. Omoc
was late and very angry when he arrived.

22:14.835 --> 22:19.047
He was ranting about the unfairness
of random testing on the Tollan people.

22:19.214 --> 22:21.091
Why is this important?

22:21.508 --> 22:24.845
We want signs of Omoc's
difference of opinion with the curia.

22:25.304 --> 22:28.640
- This can't be.
- What?

22:28.765 --> 22:32.936
According to this record, the curia
meeting adjourned in the late afternoon.

22:33.020 --> 22:36.190
- When Omoc came here it was evening.
- So?

22:36.315 --> 22:39.818
It means there are two hours of notations
missing from the records.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.655
- A slight omission?
- That's not possible.

22:43.780 --> 22:48.160
If the curia can commit murder, they can
erase two hours from the public records.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.579
You don't understand our laws.

22:50.662 --> 22:54.166
For the highest members of
our government to deceive the people,

22:54.291 --> 22:58.295
as strange as it may sound, it's an
even more heinous crime than murder.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.340
It's... It's unthinkable.

23:02.466 --> 23:06.929
At the time I thought it was strange Omoc
would be upset over an ion cannon test.

23:07.095 --> 23:09.223
Slightly more to it than that, eh?

23:09.806 --> 23:14.269
If the curia wanted to cover up this matter,
why leave Omoc's protest on record?

23:14.353 --> 23:19.691
Because a protest of Tollan policy
is filed with every level of the government.

23:19.775 --> 23:23.987
It would be impossible to erase it without
a conspiracy of massive proportions,

23:24.071 --> 23:26.448
reaching far outside the curia.

23:26.573 --> 23:31.203
So whatever happened in the time
missing, it could be why Omoc was killed.

23:38.710 --> 23:43.590
As far as what you told me, there seems
to be an evil conspiracy among the curia

23:43.715 --> 23:46.510
whose goal is to give us
everything we've wanted.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.429
- That makes no sense.
- I said that.

23:49.596 --> 23:53.684
Unless the Tollan cannot procure trinium
on their own as easily as they claim.

23:53.767 --> 23:58.480
Travell tried hard to convince us it was
a face- saving exercise to calm naysayers.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.608
Do we know what the Tollans
will do with the trinium?

24:01.692 --> 24:06.738
Lots and lots of very interesting
and unspecific things.

24:07.114 --> 24:10.033
We could tag the first shipment
to see where it goes.

24:10.117 --> 24:13.537
- How?
- We introduce a radioactive isotope.

24:13.787 --> 24:18.834
If the Tollans catch it, we say it's
a by- product of the purification process

24:18.959 --> 24:22.546
and we've been unable
to eliminate it entirely.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.550
Do it.

24:35.142 --> 24:38.729
- Travell doesn't suspect you?
- If she does, she's not letting on.

24:38.854 --> 24:41.398
We're a primitive race.
Why would she suspect us?

24:41.523 --> 24:44.776
The trinium's still moving.
It's south- southwest of here.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.863
Do you realise what you have done
by involving me?

24:47.946 --> 24:52.201
Hey, you involved yourself in this
when you sent us that warning.

24:52.284 --> 24:55.621
Warning you your world is in danger
is not the same as treason!

24:55.746 --> 25:00.792
If your leaders are involved in something
untoward, what you're doing isn't treason.

25:01.001 --> 25:04.755
- What I am doing is nothing!
- Then help us.

25:06.882 --> 25:09.176
How?

25:10.761 --> 25:14.264
Tell us how to get into Travell's office
and access her computer.

25:14.348 --> 25:18.018
- What?
- If there is a conspiracy, she's in on it.

25:18.143 --> 25:21.730
It was, in fact, Travell
that offered us the ion cannons.

25:21.855 --> 25:26.985
- It's impossible. There is no way.
- Narim, get your head outta your ass!

25:27.069 --> 25:30.030
- You started this.
- Your government is deceiving you.

25:30.113 --> 25:33.617
You said yourself that's the most
heinous crime you can think of.

25:33.742 --> 25:38.622
- I should have told the security office.
- But the curia have more power.

25:38.747 --> 25:42.167
As a citizen, is it not your duty
to investigate such a crime?

25:42.251 --> 25:45.337
- The security systems...
- Travell can turn them off.

25:45.504 --> 25:50.300
- Why would she do that?
- So she could talk to us off the record.

25:50.551 --> 25:53.637
That is a violation
of the governmental conduct code.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.764
Gee, what a shock.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.646
There is one chance.

26:03.522 --> 26:07.192
Only high- ranking members of the curia
have access to the security system

26:07.317 --> 26:10.112
in the building where
Travell's office is located.

26:10.445 --> 26:14.366
- Omoc was among them.
- And you have his personal effects.

26:14.992 --> 26:18.745
His code would be in the data device,
if it is not deactivated.

26:19.413 --> 26:24.293
OK. Daniel, Carter, go with Narim.
Check out Travell's office.

26:24.418 --> 26:26.461
Teal'c and I will track the trinium.

26:27.588 --> 26:31.425
Um, that's the thing
that lets you go through walls, right?

26:32.634 --> 26:35.888
- Yes.
- Got a couple extra layin' around?

26:37.306 --> 26:40.267
- That would be a violation...
- Good. And weapons?

26:40.517 --> 26:42.060
Colonel O'Neill...

26:42.144 --> 26:44.521
- Just in case.
- Our security sensors...

26:44.605 --> 26:49.151
The weapons carried by
yoursecurity forces remain unaffected.

27:11.340 --> 27:15.636
If this doesn't work,
Security will be here in seconds.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.983
Way to go, Omoc.

27:54.591 --> 27:58.637
Here. This is a communication sent
to our chief of science and technology

27:58.720 --> 28:00.764
just after the meeting.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.100
That was no random ion cannon test.

28:03.183 --> 28:07.020
It says a Goa'uld ship entered orbit
and the ion cannons fired in defence.

28:07.104 --> 28:08.981
Ineffectively.

28:09.231 --> 28:14.194
I don't see how that could be. Our ion
cannons have always been successful.

28:14.361 --> 28:18.740
- Maybe this Goa'uld can defend itself.
- That would be catastrophic.

28:18.866 --> 28:22.953
- We have no other weapons capable of...
- Wait a second.

28:23.036 --> 28:27.499
This makes no sense. It says despite
resisting attack, the ship left peacefully.

28:27.624 --> 28:28.709
Yeah, right

28:28.792 --> 28:33.005
Why would a Goa'uld mothership,
impervious to your ion cannons, leave?

28:33.088 --> 28:35.132
There must be more.

28:39.178 --> 28:41.847
No other records mention a Goa'uld ship.

28:41.930 --> 28:44.308
Must've been discussed off the record.

28:44.433 --> 28:48.729
The ion cannons are useless if they won't
defend against Goa'uld motherships.

28:48.812 --> 28:51.899
That's why Travell would give us
as many as we wanted.

28:52.274 --> 28:56.195
Let's see if we can find out
what the trinium's being used for.

29:25.057 --> 29:27.184
Looks like our trinium's in here.

29:29.436 --> 29:34.733
Narim said in order for the device to work
on both of us we must hold hands, O'Neill.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.862
I know.

30:23.949 --> 30:27.619
This is unlike any Tollan device
I have previously seen.

30:40.799 --> 30:42.843
Well, whatever it is,

30:44.344 --> 30:47.598
they seem to think
they're gonna need a lot of'em.

30:56.648 --> 30:58.108
Whoa.

30:58.233 --> 31:01.153
It's a weapon of mass destruction.

31:09.453 --> 31:12.789
OK, where does the trinium come in?

31:12.915 --> 31:18.045
Trinium is required to house any device
that generates our phase- shift technology.

31:19.338 --> 31:23.008
Are you saying this bomb is being made
so it can go through anything?

31:23.091 --> 31:24.968
Theoretically, yes.

31:26.178 --> 31:31.475
That must be it. This weapon is to replace
the ion cannon in defence of our planet.

31:31.558 --> 31:33.602
Narim, that doesn't add up.

31:33.852 --> 31:37.689
A Goa'uld wouldn't drop by just so
you could see his new shield technology,

31:37.773 --> 31:41.276
then go away to give your people time
to build a weapon to penetrate it.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.445
What else could have happened?

31:46.949 --> 31:50.869
Please, lower your weapons.
The building is full of security.

31:57.793 --> 32:00.003
What do you think you're doing, Narim?

32:00.128 --> 32:02.965
What do you think you are doing,
Chancellor?

32:09.012 --> 32:12.182
She is doing what she must
to preserve your world.

32:44.256 --> 32:46.300
Hello, fellas.

32:58.061 --> 33:00.105
This is not a good sign.

33:01.732 --> 33:05.986
- You are in league with a Goa'uld.
- His name is Tanith.

33:06.069 --> 33:08.822
Yeah, aren't you supposed to be dead?

33:08.906 --> 33:11.283
- If you must know...
- I must.

33:11.408 --> 33:17.039
I had left Apophis' ship in an escape pod
long before the sun exploded.

33:17.122 --> 33:19.750
Thank you, by the way.

33:20.918 --> 33:24.421
In destroying his fleet,
you did me a great favour.

33:24.546 --> 33:28.467
- It was nothing.
- How lovely it is to see you both here.

33:30.135 --> 33:33.639
I assume Teal'c
must be around somewhere.

33:33.764 --> 33:36.725
The others are being apprehended
as we speak.

33:36.808 --> 33:40.979
I am so looking forward to seeing him
and Colonel O'Neill again.

33:41.104 --> 33:43.899
How can you do this?

33:43.982 --> 33:46.443
I have done nothing alone, Narim.

33:46.527 --> 33:49.780
The curia is acting
in the interest of Tollana.

33:49.863 --> 33:51.490
You murdered Omoc.

33:51.615 --> 33:54.785
Had we not done what we did,
there would be no Tollana.

33:54.910 --> 33:58.747
And there won't be, if you do not
fulfil your promise, Chancellor.

33:58.830 --> 34:02.876
Rest assured, we will deliver as promised.

34:02.960 --> 34:07.673
You and the curia cannot make such
deals on behalf of the Tollan people.

34:07.798 --> 34:12.261
We would rather fight and die
than trade our technology to the Goa'uld.

34:12.344 --> 34:17.224
I wonder if you'd be so quick to make
that decision were you in my position.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.780
After him!

34:33.657 --> 34:35.951
He will not get away.

34:58.557 --> 35:01.560
- How did you find me?
- You're the one wearing grey.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.646
Jackson and Major Carter?

35:04.855 --> 35:08.775
We were caught by Travell and
the Goa'uld the curia are bargaining with.

35:08.901 --> 35:11.361
I managed to escape with this.

35:11.445 --> 35:14.948
But the entire security force of Tollana
must be looking for me.

35:15.032 --> 35:19.912
- And you, for that matter.
- Back up to that Goa'uld bargain part.

35:20.037 --> 35:23.957
The Tollan curia have made a deal
with a Goa'uld.

35:24.082 --> 35:26.126
His name is Tanith.

35:27.085 --> 35:29.129
Easy, big fella.

35:30.088 --> 35:31.548
What kind of deal?

35:31.632 --> 35:36.845
This Goa'uld's mothership has a new
shield impervious to our ion cannons.

35:36.970 --> 35:39.765
For the first time,
Tollana is vulnerable to attack.

35:39.848 --> 35:42.226
- There hasn't been an attack.
- No.

35:42.309 --> 35:46.063
To prevent one the curia has agreed
to build weapons for the Goa'uld.

35:46.230 --> 35:49.566
We have seen these weapons.
There are a great many.

35:49.942 --> 35:51.985
What exactly can they do?

35:52.361 --> 35:56.907
They are explosives of great power that
utilise the Tollan phase- shift technology.

35:57.032 --> 36:00.953
They will be able to penetrate
any solid matter prior to detonation.

36:01.161 --> 36:03.205
Like an iris?

36:04.122 --> 36:07.876
As you have seen, I have used our
technology to walk through the barrier

36:08.001 --> 36:10.546
that protects your planet's Stargate.

36:13.841 --> 36:17.261
We've been unable to locate them
thus far. Our efforts continue.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.805
Use Narim's health implant to locate him.

36:19.930 --> 36:23.100
- That would be in violation of the code...
- Do it!

36:26.895 --> 36:31.024
Tell your master
we will make the delivery on schedule.

36:31.733 --> 36:34.278
Excuse me? Your master?

36:34.403 --> 36:37.990
You don't think he could
do all this by himself, do you?

36:38.115 --> 36:40.909
Apophis dead,
fresh out of an escape pod...

36:40.993 --> 36:44.162
He'd have to ally himself
with someone more powertul.

36:44.246 --> 36:49.543
- So who you taking orders from now?
- The one he serves has no name.

36:49.626 --> 36:52.087
Oh, he has a name.

36:53.005 --> 36:56.091
The likes of you
are simply forbidden to know it.

36:57.467 --> 36:59.511
Do with them as you wish.

37:01.763 --> 37:08.353
However, if your pathetic security forces
finally manage to capture Teal'c,

37:08.729 --> 37:11.732
have him transported up to me.

37:19.698 --> 37:23.202
- Tanith must not possess these weapons.
- I know.

37:23.577 --> 37:26.747
- What can we do?
- Destroy them.

37:27.331 --> 37:29.708
- How?
- You tell me.

37:33.712 --> 37:39.384
Travell was right. It's not so easy when
the fate of your planet is in your hands.

37:39.468 --> 37:40.135
Narim...

37:40.219 --> 37:42.846
The Goa'uld will attack if we don't deliver.

37:42.930 --> 37:45.641
You are asking me
to destroy my own world.

37:45.724 --> 37:49.561
I'm asking you not to sacrifice Earth
and God knows how many other planets

37:49.686 --> 37:52.397
to save your own ass!

37:52.481 --> 37:55.734
I'm asking you to do the right thing,
and you know it.

38:06.995 --> 38:08.622
Your time is up, Chancellor.

38:08.747 --> 38:12.501
- We are ready to make the first delivery.
- Very well.

38:13.085 --> 38:19.591
However, before accepting, we will first
require a demonstration ofthe technology

38:19.675 --> 38:21.802
to ensure that it works as expected.

38:21.927 --> 38:25.097
I assure you it has been tested
and each weapon is fully...

38:25.180 --> 38:30.602
You will activate one ofthe weapons and
send it through your Stargate to the Tauri.

38:32.938 --> 38:34.982
You have 30 minutes.

38:56.336 --> 38:59.047
You got any idea what you're doing?

39:02.217 --> 39:04.261
None.

39:19.276 --> 39:20.360
Good enough.

39:20.861 --> 39:24.615
You knew why you were building
the devices and what they'd be used for.

39:24.698 --> 39:27.701
You just didn't expect them
to make you pull the trigger.

39:27.784 --> 39:30.495
The Goa'uld have no choice.
Earth is protected.

39:30.579 --> 39:33.207
They can't do it without
dealing with the Asgard.

39:33.290 --> 39:35.250
I had no choice either.

39:36.293 --> 39:38.670
Yes, you did.

39:40.672 --> 39:41.757
Hi, kids.

39:41.840 --> 39:47.304
They were attempting to sabotage one
of the weapons. They had this on them.

39:48.013 --> 39:51.016
Narim's health implant.
What have you done to him?

39:51.099 --> 39:54.686
Nothing. However, while
these guys were chasing us...

39:54.770 --> 39:57.064
Narim was able to move freely.

40:12.204 --> 40:14.248
Leave them! Come!

40:15.582 --> 40:17.626
Where you guys goin'?

40:17.751 --> 40:18.836
Hey!

40:18.919 --> 40:20.295
Ow! Damn!

40:35.519 --> 40:40.899
The Goa'uld will soon realise that we will
no longer honour our end of the bargain.

40:45.028 --> 40:47.072
Um, hey.

40:47.155 --> 40:49.199
We should go.

41:01.461 --> 41:04.798
- You must hurry to the Stargate.
- Aren't you coming with us?

41:04.882 --> 41:08.135
I have forced my people
to fight a battle we may lose.

41:08.218 --> 41:10.679
The least I can do is
stay and fight with them.

41:10.804 --> 41:12.764
Thank you.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.933
Good luck.

41:15.767 --> 41:17.811
I hope this isn't goodbye.

41:19.062 --> 41:21.106
Go.

41:36.496 --> 41:43.378
So, we can reasonably assume the
Goa'uld did not get any of the weapons?

41:43.462 --> 41:45.839
We can only hope.

41:45.923 --> 41:50.219
- What about these new shields?
- The Goa'uld do not share technology.

41:50.302 --> 41:55.974
Well, whoever Tanith is now working for,
these new shields give him an advantage.

41:56.099 --> 41:58.393
Teal'c, any guesses who it might be?

41:58.477 --> 42:00.854
None, General Hammond.

42:00.979 --> 42:05.776
I suppose that, whoever it is, they're
still afraid of confronting the Asgard,

42:05.859 --> 42:09.530
- or they'd've attacked Earth themselves.
- For now.

42:09.613 --> 42:12.699
Incoming communication.

42:27.422 --> 42:32.302
We're getting a direct transmission from a
Tollan long- range communication device.

42:32.427 --> 42:35.514
.. managed to get some people out.
Stargate was destroyed.

42:35.639 --> 42:38.100
- Narim.
- All defences failing.

42:38.225 --> 42:43.355
Ourships attempting to escape are being
shot down. I wanted you to know that...

42:45.065 --> 42:47.192
I'm sorry, sir. That's it.

42:47.276 --> 42:49.486
The transmission just died.
