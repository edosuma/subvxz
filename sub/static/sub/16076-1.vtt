01:44.813 --> 01:47.815
This is Cat Shit One.
CP, do you copy?

01:47.899 --> 01:49.608
<i>This is CP. Over.</i>

01:49.984 --> 01:54.488
Three canaries in sight.
I've got a visual on ten armed enemies.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.323
<i>Good work, Cat Shit One.</i>

01:56.407 --> 01:59.993
<i>We'll send a unit over.</i>
<i>Stay on the lookout until they arrive.</i>

02:00.078 --> 02:01.286
Copy.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.080
Doesn't look good, Packy.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.251
What'd you expect?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.752
Packy, we need to help them now!

02:09.878 --> 02:14.925
CP, Canary is getting tortured.
The enemy looks pretty agitated.

02:18.763 --> 02:19.763
Shit.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.854
CP, we've already got one canary down.
What's the ETA on my backup?

02:26.938 --> 02:29.398
<i>The second platoon will arrive there in</i>
<i>approx. 50 minutes.</i>

02:29.482 --> 02:32.192
Things don't look too good.
Can you get 'em here quicker?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.193
How about a chopper?

02:33.278 --> 02:36.947
<i>Alright then, we'll send one</i>
<i>over there sooner. Give us 30 minutes.</i>

02:37.073 --> 02:40.659
No, there's no way we can wait that long!
We're going in. Over.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.619
<i>Wait, Perkins. Perkins!</i>

02:42.704 --> 02:46.832
Wait, Packy.
I see at least 15 of them out there.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.293
We're taking them on ourselves?
Are you crazy?

02:49.752 --> 02:52.713
If we don't now,
they'll both end up dead.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.465
But it's impossible.
Not without backup.

02:56.092 --> 02:59.469
There are two professionals here.
That's more than enough.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.139
Wa-wait. Whaaat?

03:04.475 --> 03:05.642
Shit.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.648
You stay here and
wait for my signal over the radio.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.067
I'll go flank them from the side.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.739
You can leave if you want to,

03:18.823 --> 03:23.452
but just keep in mind that the guy
in the middle of that shit storm is me.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.412
Copy.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.832
Don't worry. We got this, ok?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.423
Botasky... now.

05:27.535 --> 05:31.038
I'm with the CMS.
I'm here to rescue you.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.789
Try to stay calm.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.550
Shit.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.138
For a second,
I thought you guys abandoned us.

05:48.222 --> 05:53.185
Sorry we're late, but don't worry about it,
we're gonna get you home in one piece.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.311
Thank you!

06:08.493 --> 06:10.285
There's gotta be one more...

06:30.139 --> 06:32.474
<i>Botasky, what's going on?</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

06:33.017 --> 06:37.437
They spotted me! I'm under attack!
I'm screwed, Packy!

06:37.522 --> 06:41.858
We're on the move, Botasky.
I need you to relocate and cover us!

07:29.198 --> 07:31.408
Come in, Botasky!
Botasky, can you cover me?!

07:32.743 --> 07:34.578
Botasky!... shit!

08:11.240 --> 08:14.117
Haaa... let me catch my breath.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.245
Don't give me that bullshit, Botasky.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.788
What the hell were you doing?

08:19.624 --> 08:22.292
I'm sorry. I was scared.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.463
You know, you aren't the only one
who's scared around here.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.465
Sorry...

08:28.925 --> 08:32.635
Of course you'll get worn out
if you carry something around like that.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.970
Take it off.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.597
But it's just so cool lookin'...

08:36.682 --> 08:40.268
All that equipment is completely useless.
That's what's slowing you down.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.983
Slowing me down...
these were expensive.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.027
I don't want to get rid of them...

09:16.347 --> 09:18.723
Don't worry. Help's on the way.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.017
CP, this is Cat Shit One.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.646
We've successfully freed the hostages.
Where we at on that chopper.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.648
<i>Perkins, listen.</i>

09:26.732 --> 09:29.568
<i>Three enemy trucks are heading south</i>
<i>toward the settlement.</i>

09:29.694 --> 09:31.861
<i>They're probably reinforcements.</i>

09:32.405 --> 09:33.238
What?

09:33.364 --> 09:35.574
Are you kidding me? We're screwed!

09:35.700 --> 09:39.327
<i>I'll send the chopper to pick you up,</i>
<i>one kilometer south of there. Move, now.</i>

09:39.412 --> 09:41.371
We have one injured canary.
Pick us up here.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.291
<i>Negative. The enemy will beat us there.</i>

09:44.375 --> 09:45.000
Damit.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.837
<i>Code name is Angel One.</i>
<i>Use a yellow smoke signal.</i>

09:48.921 --> 09:50.714
<i>Good luck! Over!</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:51.715
Copy.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.972
One kilometer south? He's on a stretcher!
They're gonna catch up to us.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.933
We don't have a choice.
We have to go. OK?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.020
Alright, we have to get
to the pick up location.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.646
Bota, you take the stretcher.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.564
...yeah.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.190
Can I ask for your help, Bowen?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.233
S... sure.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.443
Thank you.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.902
Here we go.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.905
Packy, we're ready.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.073
Come on, let's go!

10:17.199 --> 10:20.410
Botasky, you gonna have to escort them
to the chopper alone.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.954
I'll stay here and
buy you guys some time.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.373
Are you kidding me? You can't do that!

10:25.458 --> 10:28.585
If no one slows them down,
they'll definitely catch up.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.587
But coming for you, they're gonna-

10:31.088 --> 10:33.965
Botasky, we'll only risk more
if you stay with me.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.508
Don't come back, okay?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.219
That's an order!

10:41.599 --> 10:43.391
We don't have time for this shit, Botasky!

10:44.393 --> 10:45.352
Yes, sir.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.603
Ok, now move out!

10:46.771 --> 10:47.604
OK.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.623
Here they come.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.670
It started. We gotta hurry!

11:53.796 --> 11:54.754
Okay.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.043
That should scare them off.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.465
Behind that rock over there.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.052
Easy...

12:52.438 --> 12:54.189
The helicopter will be here soon.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.064
Ok...

13:39.610 --> 13:40.610
Oh, shit!

14:14.019 --> 14:15.478
Packy!

14:28.784 --> 14:31.160
Bota, why the hell'd you come back?

14:33.289 --> 14:34.497
We'll talk about that later!

14:42.172 --> 14:43.631
Packy, hurry!

14:48.512 --> 14:49.721
Botasky!

15:05.613 --> 15:08.781
I guess my gun is not so useless
after all, is it?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.951
You stubborn son-of-a-bitch.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.621
And the hostages?

15:14.705 --> 15:17.916
The hostages are safe but if we go now
I think we're all gonna be able to make it.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.208
Alright, let's go!

15:38.938 --> 15:42.190
There!

15:46.236 --> 15:47.236
Two down!

15:47.363 --> 15:48.154
Let's move!

15:54.578 --> 15:55.703
Bota, run!

16:29.738 --> 16:30.530
Shit!

16:30.614 --> 16:31.614
We're screwed.

17:02.980 --> 17:06.107
<i>Cat Shit One, this is Angel One.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

17:06.608 --> 17:09.819
This is Cat Shit One.
We're located on the southwest corner.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.820
We're surrounded by enemies.
Take 'em out!

17:13.031 --> 17:15.157
<i>Copy. We see you.</i>

17:16.452 --> 17:19.871
That's one hell of an angel to the rescue.

17:39.224 --> 17:39.849
Now!

17:39.975 --> 17:40.516
Yeah!

17:53.697 --> 17:57.742
<i>This is Angel One.</i>
<i>Enemies are retreating. Over.</i>

17:58.535 --> 18:01.579
This is Cat Shit One.
Thanks for the support.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.332
Let's go home!

18:04.416 --> 18:05.166
Yeah.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.901
Hey, Botasky.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.946
I thought I ordered you not to come back.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.572
So why the hell did you?

18:37.074 --> 18:38.741
I was trying to save your life.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.827
My life is none of your business.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.037
You disobeyed your commander's orders.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.915
Man... guess I saved you for nothing.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.210
Listen up, Bota.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.255
When we get home...

18:52.464 --> 18:54.966
all your drinks are gonna be on me.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.176
Better brace yourself!

18:58.011 --> 18:58.845
Huh?

18:59.179 --> 19:00.304
You copy?

19:01.886 --> 19:03.928
Hell yeah, I copy!
