WEBVTT

00:04.233 --> 00:06.021
Since the competition began...

00:09.000 --> 00:11.900
The best dancers
in the world

00:11.900 --> 00:13.767
have pushed themselves
to the limit.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.833
They've made it
through the qualifiers.

00:22.833 --> 00:25.833
You're through the next round!
Congratulations!

00:27.100 --> 00:28.467
They survived the duels.

00:29.700 --> 00:30.379
But tonight...

00:31.733 --> 00:33.000
The remaining acts will face

00:35.133 --> 00:36.733
the cut.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.033
The 15 remaining acts

00:41.033 --> 00:42.767
fight for just two spots

00:42.767 --> 00:44.500
in each of their divisions.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.300
There's no friendships
when it comes to the cut round.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.667
You may have to go
up against somebody

00:47.667 --> 00:49.933
that you genuinely like,
but understanding that

00:49.933 --> 00:51.233
this is for a million dollars.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.800
We have five acts in each
of the divisions now.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.100
Only two get to go through.

00:58.533 --> 00:59.733
We're gonna have
to say good-bye

00:59.733 --> 01:01.367
to some of our favorite dancers.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.500
Whoo!

01:06.500 --> 01:08.133
For the first time,

01:08.133 --> 01:10.500
the judges will each mentor
one of the divisions.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.800
You gotta finish strong.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.633
One-on-one.

01:14.633 --> 01:17.200
- That was so beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.433
And for this round only,

01:20.433 --> 01:24.367
special guest judge,
icon and dance legend

01:24.367 --> 01:26.200
Misty Copeland,

01:26.200 --> 01:28.000
an award-winning performer,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.567
who made history as
the first African American

01:30.567 --> 01:33.033
female principal dancer
with the prestigious

01:33.033 --> 01:34.800
American Ballet Theatre.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.900
I'm honored to be a part of this show.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.667
I feel like I can relate
to a lot of these dancers.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.467
This cut round is going
to be extremely brutal.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.100
- I loved it.
- Yeah!

01:47.100 --> 01:48.733
Over the next two weeks,

01:48.733 --> 01:51.167
more than half
of the acts will be cut.

01:51.167 --> 01:52.500
It's the most brutal...

01:52.500 --> 01:54.400
I was expecting a little bit more.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.467
I've seen you do better.
I expect better.

01:56.467 --> 01:57.900
And emotional...

01:57.900 --> 01:59.767
You just threw your heart and your soul

01:59.767 --> 02:01.433
all out on the stage.

02:01.433 --> 02:03.267
... round of
the competition yet.

02:04.633 --> 02:06.767
The cut starts now.

02:14.333 --> 02:17.300
Please welcome your host,
Jenna Dewan Tatum.

02:19.067 --> 02:21.500
Misty, welcome to the show.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.200
Thank you.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.167
Oh, it's so nice to have you here.

02:25.167 --> 02:27.200
Thank you for having me.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.867
You know, I couldn't imagine this show,

02:29.867 --> 02:31.900
thinking about credibility of dance

02:31.900 --> 02:33.300
and what this show is

02:33.300 --> 02:35.300
without having Misty Copeland
on the show with us.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.133
It is an honor to have
you sitting there.

02:38.133 --> 02:41.733
Okay, tonight the acts
will continue to compete

02:41.733 --> 02:43.233
within their divisions.

02:43.233 --> 02:44.833
And their score from the judges

02:44.833 --> 02:47.667
will go onto a division leader board.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.567
Only the two acts
at the top of each leader board

02:50.567 --> 02:52.033
will move forward
to the next round.

02:52.033 --> 02:55.600
This is "World of Dance."
The cut starts now.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.133
Tonight, the Junior Division

03:02.133 --> 03:03.533
is first to face the cut.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.867
Out of the five acts that remain,

03:05.867 --> 03:08.967
only the two highest-scoring
acts will survive the cut.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.467
Judge Jennifer Lopez

03:12.467 --> 03:14.967
is mentoring the
Junior Division this round.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.600
For me, it's really exciting

03:16.600 --> 03:19.200
because at that age,
you're fearless.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.467
It's about kind of mentoring
that spirit in them.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.300
So I really want to help you guys

03:23.300 --> 03:25.567
kind of hone what you're doing,

03:25.567 --> 03:27.767
so you can make it through
and get to the next round, okay?

03:27.767 --> 03:29.800
- Yeah.
- All right.

03:31.267 --> 03:33.667
Up first, Diana Pombo.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.800
I definitely didn't expect

03:35.800 --> 03:38.167
to make it through the duels round.

03:38.167 --> 03:41.300
You are just something
so incredibly different

03:41.300 --> 03:42.500
and special.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.533
Thank you.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.800
I am going to be competing

03:45.800 --> 03:47.800
against the whole Junior Division,

03:47.800 --> 03:50.167
and I know only two people
will make it through.

03:50.167 --> 03:52.400
- How are you?
- Hi.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.700
Hi. This is our second hug.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.567
- I know.
- Yes, it is.

03:55.567 --> 03:58.367
What are you thinking you wanna do?

03:58.367 --> 04:02.633
Well, the song is about
letting it all go,

04:02.633 --> 04:06.167
all your feelings inside
just as you're rising up.

04:06.167 --> 04:07.333
Okay, so let's see.

04:07.333 --> 04:08.700
Maybe I can help you a little bit.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.733
Oh.

04:10.733 --> 04:14.833
For my idol giving me tips
to make my dance better

04:14.833 --> 04:16.000
is unbelievable.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.367
Cue the music.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.333
I think there's so many
beautiful lyrics,

04:27.333 --> 04:29.200
that I want you to be singing

04:29.200 --> 04:30.900
the lyrics to yourself in your head.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.467
With each performance,
she shows us a level of depth

04:36.467 --> 04:39.900
that is just not common
from an 11-year-old dancer.

04:39.900 --> 04:43.467
She moves me in a way
that is unexpected.

04:43.467 --> 04:45.633
That was so beautiful.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.600
- Thank you so much.
- That was just so beautiful.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.200
As we get older,

04:50.200 --> 04:52.467
we get even more and more
afraid sometimes,

04:52.467 --> 04:54.167
and we have to remind ourself

04:54.167 --> 04:56.500
that there's a little
11-year-old girl in there

04:56.500 --> 04:58.733
that--that's fearless.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.800
I love what you do.
It's inspiring.

05:00.800 --> 05:05.433
Seeing JLo get emotional
while I'm dancing,

05:05.433 --> 05:06.700
I don't want to let her down.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.067
First up onstage,

05:12.067 --> 05:14.167
Diana Pombo.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.667
Yes, baby!

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:29.200 --> 06:30.967
That was crazy.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.633
I had the pleasure of mentoring Diana.

06:38.633 --> 06:41.467
You reminded me of the strength
that we all have inside us

06:41.467 --> 06:44.233
that we can do it,
we can do it, and you did it.

06:44.233 --> 06:45.600
You did a beautiful job.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.400
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.267
You are mature beyond your years

06:50.267 --> 06:51.800
as a performer.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.200
The vulnerability that you have,

06:54.200 --> 06:57.467
it just shines throughout
your entire body.

06:57.467 --> 07:00.300
Coming from a classical dancer,

07:00.300 --> 07:02.600
I'm going to give you some tools.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.867
That when you are barefoot,

07:04.867 --> 07:06.333
you have to be even more aware

07:06.333 --> 07:08.567
of the articulation in your feet

07:08.567 --> 07:10.200
and how you approach the floor,

07:10.200 --> 07:11.700
almost like an animal,

07:11.700 --> 07:13.633
so that you're more grounded
in that way,

07:13.633 --> 07:15.967
and I feel like that will resonate

07:15.967 --> 07:17.600
in the emotion that you feel.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.733
But I am so incredibly
impressed with you,

07:20.733 --> 07:22.233
not even just as a performer,

07:22.233 --> 07:23.833
but as a young woman.

07:23.833 --> 07:26.267
Thank you.
I love you so much.

07:26.267 --> 07:28.900
Thank you.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.767
You're coming out here
and you're giving us

07:30.767 --> 07:32.567
so much passion,
so much love,

07:32.567 --> 07:33.867
so much emotion.

07:33.867 --> 07:35.833
For me, one of the most
touching moments,

07:35.833 --> 07:37.367
when you were
kinda reaching out,

07:37.367 --> 07:39.400
and I was, like, drawn in,
I was like, oh, my gosh.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.233
And we're experiencing
the dance with you,

07:41.233 --> 07:43.633
rather than just watching you,
so thank you for that.

07:43.633 --> 07:45.300
Thank you.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.100
For me, it's all about
what it feels like.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.833
It's all about the story being told,

07:48.833 --> 07:53.033
and the song and the movies
married together perfectly.

07:53.033 --> 07:54.600
This is the closest
to a perfect performance

07:54.600 --> 07:55.767
I've seen from you.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.467
Oh, thank you.

07:58.467 --> 08:02.533
All right, guys, let's lock in our scores.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.267
All right, let's see your scores, baby.

08:30.267 --> 08:31.800
Oh!

08:35.732 --> 08:37.299
Yeah, baby!

08:40.967 --> 08:42.832
Your our first contestant out,

08:42.832 --> 08:44.333
so we know you're gonna be
first on the leader board,

08:44.333 --> 08:46.800
but there you go, the first spot.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.400
The top two scores will go
through to the next round.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.767
Sometimes it's a disadvantage
to go first,

08:52.767 --> 08:54.700
because we have to wait and see
what we're gonna see,

08:54.700 --> 08:56.167
but for you to get
a score like that

08:56.167 --> 08:58.167
just speaks to the performance
that you just gave.

08:58.167 --> 08:59.833
You should be very proud
no matter what happens.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.967
Thank you so much.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.133
Oh, my goodness.

09:13.133 --> 09:16.033
I love it, I love it.
That was amazing.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.200
So proud of you.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.900
The Junior Division
continues to fight

09:27.900 --> 09:30.433
for only two spots
in the divisional final.

09:30.433 --> 09:33.667
It was powerful, it was clean.
I loved it.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.433
Whoo!

09:35.433 --> 09:37.267
And later tonight,

09:37.267 --> 09:40.067
the Team Division faces the cut.

09:40.067 --> 09:41.767
Right now, you're in the top two.

09:41.767 --> 09:43.533
See if you can hang on!

09:51.300 --> 09:52.333
After a strong
start from Diana Pombo,

09:53.967 --> 09:56.000
hip-hop crew ImmaBeast
is next to take the stage.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.800
Seven, eight, one.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.800
We're 12 individual working dancers.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.467
This is most definitely
the biggest step

10:01.467 --> 10:03.433
together as a group,
just being able

10:03.433 --> 10:05.567
to be here and
being able to compete.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.400
We have so much to prove,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.067
and we have so much more to share,

10:09.067 --> 10:11.333
and we really don't want
our journey to stop here.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.267
It's gonna be a showstopper.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.467
It wasn't perfect,

10:33.467 --> 10:35.200
but you guys danced your asses off.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.367
We have to see how that holds up
against the other juniors.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.633
We'll see.

10:38.633 --> 10:40.700
With a score of 84.2...

10:40.700 --> 10:42.500
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.800
ImmaBeast takes second place

10:43.800 --> 10:45.633
on the leader board.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.800
From now on
after every performance,

10:47.800 --> 10:49.433
one act will be eliminated.

10:49.433 --> 10:52.100
Hoping to claim one of
the top two spots next

10:52.100 --> 10:53.600
is the Mihacevich Sisters.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.433
- How are you?
- How are you?

11:02.433 --> 11:04.200
In the duel round,
the judges said

11:04.200 --> 11:05.733
that we didn't take
enough risks.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.567
So we're really excited
to be back for round three

11:07.567 --> 11:09.300
to have the opportunity
to prove ourselves.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.467
Okay, so tell me
what's happening this week.

11:11.467 --> 11:14.233
Okay, so this week we want
to invite America into our home.

11:14.233 --> 11:16.367
- Okay.
- We're dancing with a couch.

11:16.367 --> 11:17.733
So right into your living room.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.867
Working with Jennifer Lopez this week

11:24.867 --> 11:26.367
was a dream come true.

11:26.367 --> 11:28.133
She's someone we've really
looked up to as a dancer

11:28.133 --> 11:29.467
and performer.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.400
I would just love to feel
the connection

11:31.400 --> 11:32.867
between the three of you more.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.400
You were, like, all looking
kind of at each other,

11:34.400 --> 11:35.933
but you're not looking
at each other.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.500
- Yeah.
- Look at each other.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.067
The more they can connect
to their power,

11:39.067 --> 11:41.167
which is the fact
that they are sisters,

11:41.167 --> 11:43.600
I mean, who really gets
to do that?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.567
Good.
Good luck!

11:45.567 --> 11:47.700
- Thank you very much.
- We'll see what happens.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.433
Make some noise
for the Mihacevich Sisters.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.667
They are living in
this moment right now.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.033
You guys moved us with joy,

13:28.033 --> 13:29.533
and it was so refreshing.

13:29.533 --> 13:32.167
I mean, I was emotional
because I was just so happy.

13:32.167 --> 13:35.200
That moment when she fell off
the back of the couch,

13:35.200 --> 13:36.700
like, I was like, ohh,

13:36.700 --> 13:39.100
on the edge of my seat,
which was fantastic.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.500
And for me that was your
best performance.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.667
Thank you so much.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.700
It just felt very original,
and it felt real.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.100
It felt like what you guys
experience on the daily

13:49.100 --> 13:51.433
as sisters in your home,
goofing around.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.733
Like, that's a real emotion
to convey,

13:53.733 --> 13:55.500
and it made me, like, tingly,

13:55.500 --> 13:58.133
and it was powerful,
it was clean.

13:58.133 --> 13:59.500
I really liked it.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.400
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.800
We talked so much
about the connection

14:04.800 --> 14:06.733
and how to bring the
performance to the next level,

14:06.733 --> 14:08.500
and you guys really,
really did that.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.133
I'm so proud of you.
Honestly, you got to me.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.133
I have three sisters, too.
There's three of us.

14:13.133 --> 14:14.733
I was just thinking, like,

14:14.733 --> 14:17.367
how amazing is it that
you get to do this together.

14:17.367 --> 14:19.333
- Don't ever forget that.
- Thank you so much.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.233
Are we ready to lock in scores?

14:23.233 --> 14:24.533
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah, that.

14:34.167 --> 14:36.300
All right, let's see how you did.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.433
Here we go.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.167
All right, here come the scores.

14:41.167 --> 14:44.467
They have to get more than
84.2 to be in the top two.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.033
Come on.

15:03.033 --> 15:05.433
Let us look at where that
puts you on the leader board.

15:06.700 --> 15:07.833
Hey!

15:07.833 --> 15:10.267
Moves you guys into second place,

15:10.267 --> 15:13.300
which unfortunately means
we say good-bye to ImmaBeast.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.833
Being eliminated today
is just gonna make us stronger

15:19.833 --> 15:22.933
and we're gonna go back home,
we're gonna train even harder,

15:22.933 --> 15:24.833
and do the best that we can
and hopefully we can come back

15:24.833 --> 15:26.600
for next season.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.500
Hey, congratulations, you guys.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.867
Thank you so much.

15:30.867 --> 15:32.100
Fingers crossed.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.756
- They danced beautifully.
- Oh, they did.

15:36.767 --> 15:38.378
Hey.

15:38.950 --> 15:40.360
__

15:40.491 --> 15:41.689
__

15:41.833 --> 15:43.333
But will Diana Pombo

15:43.333 --> 15:45.167
and the Mihacevich Sisters
be able to hold on

15:45.167 --> 15:46.800
to those top spots,

15:46.800 --> 15:50.400
when heavy hitters The Lab
and Eva Igo perform next?

15:56.333 --> 15:57.333
Diana Pombo
and the Mihacevich Sisters

15:59.267 --> 16:02.167
are currently holding the top
two spots on the leader board.

16:02.167 --> 16:04.867
Next to face the cut is the lab.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.933
We come to The Lab, and we don't worry

16:11.933 --> 16:14.000
about being judged.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.600
Being able to enter this competition

16:15.600 --> 16:18.367
and stay with these guys,
it really means a lot to me

16:18.367 --> 16:21.100
to be able to have people
to call family.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.667
Ahh!

16:22.667 --> 16:24.633
We really hope that
we are going to make it

16:24.633 --> 16:25.767
into the top two.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.167
It would mean everything to us.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.667
All right, tell me a little bit
about your routine.

16:30.667 --> 16:33.200
So the song that we chose
for this routine

16:33.200 --> 16:35.433
is "Disco Inferno" by 50 Cent.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.933
- Okay.
- We feel like you as an artist

16:37.933 --> 16:41.667
and 50 Cent as an artist
and those older era people

16:41.667 --> 16:45.367
as artists, they're--

16:45.367 --> 16:48.400
They all express so much
versatility within their career,

16:48.400 --> 16:50.133
and they don't just
stick to one thing.

16:50.133 --> 16:52.433
So what you're saying is
that that era of artists,

16:52.433 --> 16:54.100
we were the trailblazers
who showed you

16:54.100 --> 16:56.033
that you could do branding,
that you could be an actor,

16:56.033 --> 16:57.667
that you could be a singer,
that you could be a dancer,

16:57.667 --> 16:58.900
that you could be a performer.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.067
Is that what you were trying to say?

17:00.067 --> 17:01.100
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.667
That's what I was hoping.

17:08.267 --> 17:09.900
Okay, that part right there,

17:09.900 --> 17:12.867
it's such a good move
that her doing it by herself

17:12.867 --> 17:15.733
over and over,
either maybe one, two, three,

17:15.733 --> 17:17.333
- You guys can join in on it.
- Yeah.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.933
Let's try that, just this part.

17:18.933 --> 17:20.767
The Lab is special.

17:20.767 --> 17:22.967
These kids haven't had it
easy in life.

17:22.967 --> 17:25.633
They depend on each other,
they protect each other.

17:25.633 --> 17:27.400
They're like a family.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.133
I really feel like if they
just tap into that connection,

17:30.133 --> 17:31.700
they can really be a threat.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.100
There we go.

17:39.567 --> 17:41.833
That's a wow moment.

17:41.833 --> 17:45.067
JLo's really pushing us
to, like, another level.

17:45.067 --> 17:48.433
She's really amazing because
she's really hardworking,

17:48.433 --> 17:51.467
and she gave us a lot
of great critiques.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.100
Is that how you say it, critiques?

17:53.100 --> 17:54.867
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.367
Okay, group hug.

18:01.633 --> 18:05.133
Next onstage, it's The Lab.

18:12.233 --> 18:14.767
They're adorable.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.300
Whoo!

19:36.200 --> 19:37.800
Yes!

19:37.800 --> 19:40.100
Good job.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.500
Yeah!

19:41.500 --> 19:44.033
Ahh!

19:44.033 --> 19:45.533
She's all...

19:47.633 --> 19:48.733
I love it!

19:48.733 --> 19:51.300
That was like...

19:51.300 --> 19:53.567
I felt it!

19:53.567 --> 19:55.000
I felt the energy from the beginning

19:55.000 --> 19:57.067
all the way to the end.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.133
Um, the kip-ups.

19:59.133 --> 20:01.467
She started it, and it
was like, oh, they're both--

20:01.467 --> 20:03.200
oh, they're all doing it now!

20:03.200 --> 20:05.400
I saw it, she started it.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.900
It was sick, it was sick.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.133
Y'all killed it.
That was awesome.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.167
From juniors to groups,

20:12.167 --> 20:14.667
this is easily one of
the cleanest groups we have.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

20:17.533 --> 20:19.500
The routine as a whole,
we worked on it.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.633
I felt so kind of overtaken

20:22.633 --> 20:26.633
by your energy through
the whole entire thing.

20:26.633 --> 20:28.133
There was moments
where it was, like,

20:28.133 --> 20:31.733
super, like, incredibly clean,
so good job.

20:35.533 --> 20:38.733
- I loved it.
- Thank you.

20:38.733 --> 20:41.133
I think the one thing
that I have to say,

20:41.133 --> 20:42.467
sometimes there
were individuals

20:42.467 --> 20:44.600
that stuck out more to me,
which I feel like

20:44.600 --> 20:46.833
shouldn't necessarily happen
with a team,

20:46.833 --> 20:49.033
but I loved it.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.367
Thank you.

20:50.367 --> 20:53.400
All right, guys, let's lock in scores.

21:06.133 --> 21:08.700
They have to make more
than 85.5

21:08.700 --> 21:10.533
to make it to the top two.

21:10.533 --> 21:12.533
Are you guys on pins
and needles right now,

21:12.533 --> 21:13.767
waiting to find out?

21:13.767 --> 21:15.067
- Yeah.
- Maybe a little bit, yeah.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.367
All right, guys, let's see your scores.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.867
So close!

21:43.867 --> 21:45.467
All right, let's look
where that puts you guys

21:45.467 --> 21:47.333
on the leader board.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.367
One more act left to see
if you make it through,

21:57.367 --> 22:00.100
but right now you're in
the top two. Congratulations.

22:02.133 --> 22:03.867
See if you can hang on.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.233
It has been an absolute honor

22:10.233 --> 22:11.867
to have your family
here with us.

22:11.867 --> 22:13.800
We're so grateful for everything

22:13.800 --> 22:16.967
that we've gotten to do
since we've been here.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.800
I'm just so happy
that we got to do this,

22:18.800 --> 22:22.333
and it was just such
an amazing experience.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.867
These are tears of joy.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.433
Congratulations, you guys!

22:27.433 --> 22:28.733
Thank you!

22:28.733 --> 22:31.033
It was electric, I would say.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.933
In the top two on the leader board.

22:32.933 --> 22:34.600
With only
one performance left,

22:34.600 --> 22:37.333
Diana Pombo has guaranteed
her spot in the next round.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.700
Diana, you have made it through

22:38.700 --> 22:40.700
to the divisional finals,
congratulations.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.300
Eva Igo
gets her chance to fight

22:51.300 --> 22:52.300
for the final spot.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.233
Eva, let's see your scores.

23:02.367 --> 23:04.312
There's only
one performance left

23:04.333 --> 23:05.700
in the Junior Division.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.700
Eva Igo must score
higher than an 86

23:07.700 --> 23:09.600
to beat The Lab and secure a spot

23:09.600 --> 23:11.633
in the divisional finals.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.800
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.800
- Good.
- When I found out Jennifer

23:17.800 --> 23:19.467
was gonna be
my mentor this week,

23:19.467 --> 23:21.933
I was really excited
and nervous.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.567
So tell me a little bit about
what your routine's gonna be.

23:24.567 --> 23:25.900
I have a cloak,

23:25.900 --> 23:30.067
and the cloak symbolizes
all my insecurities.

23:30.067 --> 23:31.967
Do you feel like you have
a lot of insecurity?

23:31.967 --> 23:33.733
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna show it to me,

23:33.733 --> 23:35.000
and then we'll talk about it
a little bit?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:39.033 --> 23:42.367
Eva is an exceptional
technical dancer.

23:42.367 --> 23:44.100
And she's a smart little girl,

23:44.100 --> 23:46.133
and she knows, oh, I'm supposed
to be feeling something here,

23:46.133 --> 23:47.933
but she's not allowing herself.

23:47.933 --> 23:51.067
There's a block there.
I need her to let go.

23:51.067 --> 23:52.733
We know how strong you are.

23:52.733 --> 23:55.733
What's gonna move us is
what it means when you do it.

23:55.733 --> 23:58.133
What is the thing you're
most insecure about?

24:00.267 --> 24:01.867
It's hard to open up to the things

24:01.867 --> 24:03.567
that I'm going to show in my dance.

24:03.567 --> 24:07.300
My parents split up,
and it's been hard for me.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.533
There's like--it's been a hard
couple years for my family.

24:12.500 --> 24:16.100
So I guess not having, like,
the perfect family.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.333
Yeah. I get that.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.400
I understand that.

24:24.400 --> 24:28.367
So that's what you have to dance.

24:34.367 --> 24:35.967
- You understand?
- Yeah.

24:35.967 --> 24:38.400
So you can't just make believe
you're taking off that cloak.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.267
In this dance, take it off.

24:41.267 --> 24:43.200
And let it heal you
a little bit,

24:43.200 --> 24:44.800
'cause as artists
that's what we do.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.300
Don't be afraid to feel that emotion.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.667
Bring everything you are
to the dance.

24:48.667 --> 24:52.033
Everything.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.367
Next to take the stage,

24:53.367 --> 24:57.600
it's Eva Igo.

26:59.267 --> 27:01.467
- You did so good.
- Thank you.

27:01.467 --> 27:03.000
- Do you feel good?
- Yeah.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.500
Yeah?
You feel better?

27:04.500 --> 27:05.600
Do you know how good it was?

27:05.600 --> 27:07.000
- Yeah.
- It was awesome.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.467
Thank you so much.

27:11.133 --> 27:13.367
Eva...

27:13.367 --> 27:15.200
first of all,

27:15.200 --> 27:17.833
you belong here, 110%.

27:20.033 --> 27:22.100
What I really felt from you this time

27:22.100 --> 27:23.500
was much more emotion.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.433
What did this performance
mean to you?

27:26.867 --> 27:29.233
Everybody at some point
has felt as though

27:29.233 --> 27:32.200
they, like,

27:32.200 --> 27:35.567
aren't right,
and they don't have a purpose.

27:41.433 --> 27:44.033
So we have to realize...

27:46.567 --> 27:50.033
that our insecurities
will always be here,

27:50.033 --> 27:52.267
but we have to use them
to strengthen ourselves.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.233
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

28:02.233 --> 28:03.900
Everything we talked about

28:03.900 --> 28:06.867
and everything that
I wanted to share with you,

28:06.867 --> 28:09.367
I feel like you just
threw your heart

28:09.367 --> 28:11.667
and your soul all out onstage tonight.

28:14.633 --> 28:17.633
You are an inspiration
to young girls everywhere.

28:17.633 --> 28:19.233
- You genuinely are.
- Thank you.

28:19.233 --> 28:21.133
Genuinely.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.533
And to grown men.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.700
You're 13 years old, is that right?

28:26.700 --> 28:28.600
- I'm 14.
- You're 14.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.133
So many of the dancers
I've seen out here tonight

28:30.133 --> 28:32.000
that had bare feet,
like it's hard for me to watch

28:32.000 --> 28:34.233
someone with bare feet when
they don't really understand

28:34.233 --> 28:36.800
how to use them,
and I feel like you were--

28:36.800 --> 28:38.633
they were like little suctions
on the floor,

28:38.633 --> 28:41.067
which is why you're so stable
when you're on one leg

28:41.067 --> 28:42.533
or you're balancing.

28:42.533 --> 28:44.000
And you're-- you're a beautiful soul,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.433
and a beautiful dancer,
and a beautiful performer.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.200
Thank you so much.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.767
You ready to lock in, guys?

28:51.767 --> 28:54.233
Let's do it.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.600
The Lab, she needs
to make more than an 86

28:57.600 --> 28:59.733
to get in the top two
on the leader board.

29:03.267 --> 29:05.033
I'm proud of you guys
no matter what.

29:05.033 --> 29:06.067
Thank you.

29:06.067 --> 29:07.667
Eva, let's see your scores.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.133
92.5.

29:29.133 --> 29:32.933
That puts you on the leader
board into first place!

29:37.533 --> 29:40.467
Listen, I want you
to know something.

29:40.467 --> 29:44.067
You are an inspiration
to kids all over the world.

29:44.067 --> 29:45.967
Hold your head up high,
be proud of what you did.

29:45.967 --> 29:47.400
Oh, sweetie.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.200
We're gonna leave here
with our heads high,

29:49.200 --> 29:50.833
because tonight
we did our best

29:50.833 --> 29:52.433
and we left it out there
on the stage.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.433
I'm just proud of you.

29:57.433 --> 29:59.767
I'm proud that you were able
to peel back that layer.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.400
That's what takes everything
to--to the stratosphere.

30:12.467 --> 30:14.267
Eva!

30:16.267 --> 30:18.100
You two are our divisional finalists.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.233
You will go head-to-head
in the next round

30:20.233 --> 30:21.667
of the divisional finals.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.567
- It's just hard to believe.
- Two soloists.

30:23.567 --> 30:26.033
Come here, my girls.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.833
- I'm just really happy.
- Me too.

30:28.833 --> 30:31.500
Oh, two powerhouses.
I can't wait to see it.

30:38.767 --> 30:41.800
The Team Division
enters the cut.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.033
Whoa!

30:43.033 --> 30:44.900
And the tricks were out of this world.

30:44.900 --> 30:47.100
Stunning.

30:54.033 --> 30:56.085
Second to showcase
their talent in the cut

30:56.133 --> 30:57.633
is the Team Division.

30:57.633 --> 30:59.933
After tough competition
in the duels,

30:59.933 --> 31:01.200
five teams remain,

31:01.200 --> 31:03.133
but only the top two scoring teams

31:03.133 --> 31:04.800
will make it through the cut.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.567
This week the remaining teams

31:06.567 --> 31:08.900
are being mentored by judge NE-YO.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.300
I promise you, this is definitely

31:10.300 --> 31:12.600
gonna be the most exciting
division of the cut.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.933
So what I'm gonna,
I'm gonna work

31:13.933 --> 31:15.800
with each of you
individually and figure out

31:15.800 --> 31:17.333
what it's gonna take
to get a million dollars.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.600
Are we good?
We ready to do it?

31:18.600 --> 31:20.700
Here we go.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.400
Up first, Swing Latino.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.500
We made it to the cut.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.800
Ahh!

31:27.800 --> 31:30.100
We are one step closer to our dream.

31:31.667 --> 31:33.733
The Energy Guys
is what I call you guys.

31:33.733 --> 31:35.300
There's always a lot of energy.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.033
So I'm anxious to see what it is

31:37.033 --> 31:38.633
you guys have in store for us next.

31:38.633 --> 31:40.052
__

31:40.231 --> 31:41.400
__

31:41.400 --> 31:43.500
- No sparkles this time?
- No.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.967
Oh, okay, okay.

31:44.967 --> 31:46.567
That's gonna be an interesting change,

31:46.567 --> 31:49.967
because one thing you guys
are known for is, "Wah."

31:49.967 --> 31:51.167
You ready to show me?

31:52.533 --> 31:53.900
All right, let's do it,
let's do it.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.633
Hold on, hold on, hey!

31:58.633 --> 32:00.767
This week we are bringing

32:00.767 --> 32:03.800
a Colombian street party
to the stage.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.433
Bravo, bravo.

32:11.433 --> 32:13.933
The beginning, big energy.

32:13.933 --> 32:17.600
Middle, big energy.
The ending...

32:17.600 --> 32:20.100
falls flat just a little bit.
You gotta finish strong.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.500
I like the fact that they are
trying to shed some layers

32:22.500 --> 32:24.100
and show us a little bit
of the depth

32:24.100 --> 32:25.967
as opposed to just
the shiny exterior.

32:25.967 --> 32:28.367
However, the last 20 seconds,

32:28.367 --> 32:30.200
that's the part that we're
gonna remember the most.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.133
End on something--
something big.

32:32.133 --> 32:33.733
Thank you.

32:38.933 --> 32:41.433
Next up onstage,
it's Swing Latino.

32:44.900 --> 32:47.367
Yo!

32:47.367 --> 32:50.267
Here we go.
Start of the team.

32:52.233 --> 32:53.600
I miss the sparkles.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.533
I miss the sparkles.
Just saying.

32:55.533 --> 32:58.133
This is not the round
to lose the sparkles.

32:58.133 --> 33:00.300
No.

34:11.067 --> 34:13.800
Way to the performance.

34:15.167 --> 34:16.867
It's hard to match that energy.

34:16.867 --> 34:18.699
- It's so hard.
- What?

34:22.300 --> 34:24.367
So...

34:24.369 --> 34:29.654
__

34:29.733 --> 34:32.766
And the tricks were out of this world.

34:32.766 --> 34:36.433
The cleanliness with
how fast you guys are moving,

34:36.433 --> 34:39.433
for it to be that clean and
moving at that lightning speed

34:39.433 --> 34:41.433
is unheard of.

34:41.433 --> 34:43.100
- Top notch.
- Thank you.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.733
What's you guys think?
Misty?

34:44.733 --> 34:46.233
The two pictures
in the beginning

34:46.233 --> 34:49.266
that just came to life,
it was stunning.

34:49.266 --> 34:51.167
I've been there,
I've been to Colombia,

34:51.167 --> 34:53.433
and I felt like I was back there.

34:54.867 --> 34:56.400
- I wanna go to that party.
- I wanna go, yeah.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.333
Let's go, I wanna go.
Let's go, hey, hey, hey.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.733
It's so good. How much do you
want to win this competition?

35:05.733 --> 35:12.087
__

35:12.314 --> 35:15.542
__

35:15.942 --> 35:20.586
__

35:23.500 --> 35:26.567
I can see how much
this means to you all.

35:26.567 --> 35:28.100
Amazing performance,
but I do miss the sequins

35:28.100 --> 35:29.733
and the rhinestones.

35:32.833 --> 35:35.400
Win or lose this competition,

35:35.400 --> 35:36.767
everyone will walk away from this

35:36.767 --> 35:38.667
knowing the name Swing Latino,

35:38.667 --> 35:41.300
and we applaud and respect
what it is that you do.

35:44.333 --> 35:47.267
All right, we're gonna
lock in our scores, okay?

35:58.900 --> 36:00.733
Swing Latino, let's see your scores.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.467
Very high.
Wow, wow, wow.

36:20.467 --> 36:22.133
You're the first group,
so you're number one

36:22.133 --> 36:23.867
on the leader board right now.

36:23.867 --> 36:26.033
It's a great score,
hopefully you can hold on to it,

36:26.033 --> 36:27.867
and we'll see what happens,
good luck.

36:27.867 --> 36:30.800
Good job, guys.

36:33.833 --> 36:36.733
You let everybody here
into a very emotional,

36:36.733 --> 36:39.100
very, very vulnerable,
very, very personable place.

36:47.800 --> 36:48.700
Up second
in the Team Division

36:49.633 --> 36:51.767
is Super Cr3w.

36:51.767 --> 36:53.800
You know you guys are late.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.667
For us to become top two,

36:55.667 --> 36:57.900
we're gonna have
to take more risks.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.467
Let's do something
that no one's ever seen

36:59.467 --> 37:00.733
Super Cr3w do.

37:00.733 --> 37:03.100
Super Cr3w,
one of the scariest crews.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.233
Having NE-YO as a mentor,

37:05.233 --> 37:07.067
he understands
where we're coming from.

37:07.067 --> 37:08.800
We come from
the hip-hop culture,

37:08.800 --> 37:10.467
and I feel that that's
close to his background.

37:10.467 --> 37:12.633
You've already set a really,
really high bar for yourselves.

37:12.633 --> 37:15.433
So what is the next level
of the Super Cr3w?

37:15.433 --> 37:17.367
In this performance,
we're kinda bringing

37:17.367 --> 37:19.500
a certain emotion in the piece.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.867
It's about our loved ones,
people we've lost.

37:21.867 --> 37:24.533
Ten years ago, I don't think
that we had the experience

37:24.533 --> 37:27.133
in life to pull
something like this off.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.333
Throughout out
the last ten years,

37:31.333 --> 37:33.200
we've lost people that we loved.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.067
I lost my brother.
He was an artist.

37:36.067 --> 37:38.033
I lost my mom
four years ago to cancer.

37:38.033 --> 37:41.667
It's just the most
painful thing to go through,

37:41.667 --> 37:45.300
watching someone get sick
and fight.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.000
- This is for them.
- What it is to be

37:47.000 --> 37:51.167
a B-boy is to be tough.

37:51.167 --> 37:54.067
It's really, really risky
to take a style

37:54.067 --> 37:55.467
that is so anti-emotion

37:55.467 --> 37:57.067
and try to pour
emotion into it.

37:57.067 --> 38:00.733
If you're going for emotion,
we need to see vulnerability.

38:00.733 --> 38:03.300
We need to see it
in your face.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.667
We want this more than we've
possibly wanted anything.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.467
Put your hands together

38:11.467 --> 38:13.300
for Super Cr3w.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.300
Hey!

39:58.367 --> 40:00.133
Wow, wow, wow.

40:00.133 --> 40:01.667
Super Cr3w.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.167
One of my favorite things
to see on stage

40:04.167 --> 40:05.667
is a group of strong men

40:05.667 --> 40:07.433
that can make you feel something,

40:07.433 --> 40:09.033
that are vulnerable,

40:09.033 --> 40:10.533
that are showing a different side

40:10.533 --> 40:15.167
than you would expect
to see from a male dancer.

40:15.167 --> 40:18.367
I think that it's good to step
outside of your comfort zone.

40:18.367 --> 40:19.867
I just feel like overall,

40:19.867 --> 40:21.833
like, it didn't really come together

40:21.833 --> 40:25.767
in a way that I think
you guys can.

40:25.767 --> 40:29.700
That performance, I mean,
just the synchronicity,

40:29.700 --> 40:31.067
how together you guys were.

40:31.067 --> 40:33.367
You guys were floating
across the stage

40:33.367 --> 40:35.800
as one unit, as one group.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.600
I got really emotional watching you.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.133
I mean, it was just
a beautiful performance.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.533
You let everybody here
into a very, very emotional,

40:47.533 --> 40:49.867
very, very vulnerable,
very, very private

40:49.867 --> 40:53.033
and personal place.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.767
We spoke on that being the thing

40:55.767 --> 40:57.300
that is gonna make
or break this performance,

40:57.300 --> 40:58.600
and you guys made it.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.833
Thank you.

41:01.833 --> 41:04.600
But not as strong as
we've grown accustomed

41:04.600 --> 41:06.767
to seeing from you guys,
not as clean.

41:06.767 --> 41:09.867
Taking nothing away from it
as a performance piece itself.

41:09.867 --> 41:13.833
All right, guys,
we're gonna lock in scores.

41:34.133 --> 41:37.767
All right, we're gonna take
a look at the leader board.

41:37.767 --> 41:40.467
That's put you
right under Swing Latino.

41:40.467 --> 41:42.400
- Congratulations, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.000
How are you guys feeling?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.200
I think that everyone in the group

41:48.200 --> 41:49.667
is proud of what they did.

41:49.667 --> 41:51.200
We're glad that we got
to go out there and perform.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.000
Did we just watch the same performance?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.867
It was creative and fresh,

41:56.867 --> 41:58.433
but I don't think that it was executed

41:58.433 --> 41:59.600
the best that
it could have been

41:59.600 --> 42:01.200
- I agree.
- It was risky.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.267
I applaud them for taking the risk.

42:03.267 --> 42:05.567
With two scores
on the leader board,

42:05.567 --> 42:07.167
the competition begins.

42:07.167 --> 42:09.667
From this point on
after every performance,

42:09.667 --> 42:11.400
one act will be cut.
