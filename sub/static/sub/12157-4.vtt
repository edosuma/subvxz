WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.306
(imitates airplane engine
roaring)
MOMMY, MORE MILK.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.507
YOU FORGOT TO SAY "PLEASE."

00:06.540 --> 00:08.176
MORE MILK, PLEASE.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.511
YOU ARE MY FAVORITE CUSTOMER.
MWAH.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.249
MORE PANCAKES, PLEASE.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.919
MY LIFE IS SO HARD.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.388
WAIT. HOLD ON TO THAT STORY.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.655
KRISTIN IS GONNA WANT
TO HEAR THIS

00:21.689 --> 00:24.158
WHEN SHE GETS OFF
OF HER HANDS AND KNEES.

00:24.192 --> 00:27.561
SO I'M TRYING ON BATHING SUITS
FOR MY TRIP TO CANCUN,

00:27.595 --> 00:28.562
AND IT'S TORTURE.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.599
LIKE, EVERY SINGLE SUIT
LOOKS AMAZING ON ME.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.001
WOW. HOW DO YOU BOUNCE
BACK FROM THAT?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.269
MORNING.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.704
AH, BOYD, LOOK AT THAT.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.039
A WOMAN WORKING WHILE
YOU'RE SITTING IN A CHAIR.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.408
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU

00:40.441 --> 00:42.410
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
LIKE THIS, BUT...

00:42.443 --> 00:44.044
HEY, MOM, DAD,

00:44.078 --> 00:46.614
I NEED $2,000
FOR MY TRIP TO CANCUN.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.082
OH!

00:48.116 --> 00:50.518
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, I HAVE
A CRISP $2,000 BILL RIGHT HERE.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.586
REALLY?
NO!

00:52.620 --> 00:55.623
OH. HONEY, DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR
DAD. WE'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.391
YOU WILL?
NO. (laughs)

00:57.425 --> 00:59.527
(laughs)

00:59.560 --> 01:01.229
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
YOU WANT TO GO TO CANCUN,

01:01.262 --> 01:03.231
HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS
AND THE DRUG CARTELS,

01:03.264 --> 01:05.433
YOU GOTTA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET THE MONEY YOURSELF.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.800
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU GUYS GAVE ALL THAT MONEY

01:06.834 --> 01:08.436
TO KRISTIN
WHEN SHE WAS A SENIOR.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.304
TO HAVE MY BABY.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.740
YOU HAD YOUR FUN.
LET ME HAVE MINE.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.309
IT'S TOO BAD
THERE ISN'T A WAY

01:15.343 --> 01:16.877
THAT YOU COULD GET UP
BEFORE NOON,

01:16.910 --> 01:18.579
GO TO A PLACE OF BUSINESS,

01:18.612 --> 01:21.382
DO A TASK,
AND GET COMPENSATED FOR IT.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.583
OOH. I HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.785
IT'S CALLED A JOB.
JOB.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.820
HEY, KRIS,
WEREN'T YOU SAYING

01:26.854 --> 01:28.489
YOU GUYS WERE LOOKING
FOR A NEW WAITRESS...
(mouths words)

01:28.522 --> 01:31.825
AT THE DINER?
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.294
I THINK I'D MAKE
A GREAT WAITRESS.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.329
I COULD EVEN MAKE THAT UNIFORM
LOOK GOOD.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.564
NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.500
IT'S A VERY HIGH DEGREE
OF DIFFICULTY.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.934
OKAY, BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

01:40.968 --> 01:45.506
THIS PLACE WILL SUCK THE LIFE
AND HOPE OUT OF YOUR VERY SOUL.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.674
BUT THERE'S
A CUTE FRY COOK.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.742
CUTE FRY COOK.
I'M IN. (giggles)

01:48.776 --> 01:50.678
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME--

01:50.711 --> 01:52.613
MANDY LISTENING
TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY,

01:52.646 --> 01:55.949
BALANCING PLATES, AND TRYING
TO MAKE CHANGE. (chuckles)

01:55.983 --> 01:58.652
MANDY, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.621
HONEY, WE'LL GIVE YOU
THE MONEY FOR CANCUN.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.656
RIGHT. YOU HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME TO WORK.
YEAH.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.657
REALLY?

02:03.691 --> 02:05.526
NO. (laughs)
NO. (laughs)

02:05.559 --> 02:06.527
(stomps foot)

02:06.560 --> 02:07.828
(clink)

02:11.865 --> 02:14.802
BOOK HER? YOU BROUGHT HER.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.170
GOOD MORNING, SIRS.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.171
HEY, KYLE.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.606
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KYLE?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.873
ONE OF YOUR EX-WIVES
CAME IN THIS MORNING

02:19.907 --> 02:21.675
AND TRIED TO GET
INTO YOUR OFFICE,

02:21.709 --> 02:22.843
BUT I STOPPED HER.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.678
EX-WIFE? WHICH ONE?

02:24.712 --> 02:26.714
SHE SAID, "ONE AND THREE."

02:28.482 --> 02:30.618
WANDA.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.622
THAT EXPLAINS ALL
THE FLYING MONKEYS OUT FRONT.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.690
THANKS FOR STOPPING HER, KYLE.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.659
YEAH.
THANKS.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.029
I THOUGHT YOU STOPPED HER.

02:42.062 --> 02:45.799
I DID, BUT THEN SHE SAID
I WAS CUTE.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.602
AND I'M NOT USED TO PEOPLE
BEING NICE TO ME AROUND HERE.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.675
HELLO, HANDSOME.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.578
(chuckles)
STOP. I'M BLUSHING.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.414
SHE WAS TALKING TO ME,
YOU IDIOT.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.150
WELL, TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS UNPLEASURE?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.253
JUST CHECKING
ON OUR BUSINESS.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.255
I AM STILL A SILENT PARTNER.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.523
SILENT BUT DEADLY.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.826
GENTLEMEN, COULD I HAVE A MOMENT
IN PRIVATE WITH MY EX?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.094
SURE.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.763
BE RIGHT OUTSIDE, ED.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.898
KEEP HER BY THE WINDOW.
IF THINGS GET UGLY,

03:17.931 --> 03:21.735
I CAN SQUEEZE OFF A SHOT
FROM MY OFFICE.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.705
SO... THANKS FOR STOPPING BY,
WANDA,

03:24.738 --> 03:26.374
I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME CHILDREN
WAITING FOR YOU

03:26.407 --> 03:28.909
IN YOUR LITTLE GINGERBREAD HOUSE
IN THE WOODS, AH?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.010
(laughs)

03:30.043 --> 03:34.948
ED, I HAVE MISSED
THAT CAUSTIC WIT.
MM.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.684
OOH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:36.717 --> 03:40.354
JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU
STUCK A KNIFE IN MY BACK.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.589
YOU THROW ONE KNIFE

03:41.622 --> 03:44.091
IN SEVEN NONCONSECUTIVE YEARS
OF MARRIAGE--

03:44.124 --> 03:47.060
IT'S NOT THE THROWING.
IT'S WHERE IT LANDED.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.562
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:48.596 --> 03:51.565
I'M HERE ABOUT THAT VINEYARD
YOU BOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA

03:51.599 --> 03:53.100
TWO WEEKS
BEFORE OUR DIVORCE,

03:53.133 --> 03:56.570
WHICH YOU NEGLECTED TO LIST
AMONG YOUR ASSETS.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.805
I WANT MY HALF.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.307
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT
THAT VINEYARD?

03:59.340 --> 04:02.276
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE
UNTIL YOU JUST CONFIRMED IT.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.713
SO THANK YOU.
MY LAWYER WILL BE IN TOUCH.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.881
YOU BLOODSUCKING VAMPIRE.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.618
I CAN'T BELIEVE I CHEATED
ON MY SECOND WIFE WITH YOU.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.619
SHE DESERVED BETTER.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.220
OH, PLEASE.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.156
SHE CALLED TO THANK ME
FOR GIVING HER THE NIGHT OFF.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.329
SEE YOU LATER, CUTIE.

04:21.362 --> 04:25.799
OKAY, THAT TIME,
I KNOW SHE WAS TALKING TO ME.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.470
SOMEBODY TOLD WANDA
ABOUT MY VINEYARD.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.804
YOU WERE RIGHT, MIKE,

04:30.838 --> 04:32.506
WHEN YOU TOLD ME I SHOULDN'T
BRAG ABOUT IT.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.007
NO. NO. NO. NO.
WHAT IS SAID IS,

04:34.041 --> 04:37.845
"YOUR WINE IS
NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT."

04:37.878 --> 04:40.581
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
THAT VINEYARD WAS A SECRET.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.516
I JUST TOLD A FEW OF MY DEAREST
FRIENDS THAT TIME...
MM-HMM.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.319
AND ONE OF THEM IS
A FILTHY SEWER RAT.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.654
YEAH. WELL, ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS FIGURE OUT

04:46.687 --> 04:49.590
WHO KNEW ABOUT THE VINEYARD
AND WHO'S BEEN TALKING TO WANDA.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.325
WHEN I CATCH THAT RAT,
I'M GONNA POISON HIM.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.495
YOU MIGHT TRY ONE
OF YOUR CABERNETS.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.698
(Mike) HEY, BABY.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.799
(Vanessa) HEY, HON.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.133
HOW WAS YOUR DAY AT WORK?

05:00.167 --> 05:03.103
UH, IT WAS, WELL,
JUST BORING GEOLOGY STUFF.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.839
I'M TESTING A NEW
GAMMA RAY SPECTROSCOPY TOOL

05:05.873 --> 05:08.842
ON SOME SAMPLES
FROM THE NIOBRARA SHALE.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.078
(clicks tongue) GOOD.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.717
SOMETIMES A "JUST FINE.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?"

05:16.750 --> 05:18.519
WOULD WORK FOR ME.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.187
I HAD A WEIRD DAY,

05:20.220 --> 05:22.390
'CAUSE ED'S EX, WANDA,
SHOWED UP.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.524
UH-HUH.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.726
ARE YOU STILL IN CONTACT
WITH WANDA?

05:25.759 --> 05:28.629
UH, YEAH, YEAH.
WE HAD LUNCH A WHILE BACK.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.830
WHAT'S A WHILE BACK?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.499
WEDNESDAY.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.203
SO YOU'RE
THE FILTHY SEWER RAT.

05:36.236 --> 05:40.574
WOW. OUR PET NAMES
HAVE TAKEN A LEFT TURN.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.710
DID YOU TELL HER
ABOUT ED'S VINEYARD?

05:42.743 --> 05:46.680
UH, YEAH, YEAH. WE WERE
HAVING WINE. IT WAS ON TOPIC.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.316
SO YOU'RE POUNDING DOWN WINES
AT LUNCH?
NOT POUNDING.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.685
THEN YOU GO BACK TO THE OFFICE
AND SHOOT STUFF WITH GAMMA RAYS?

05:51.719 --> 05:56.189
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S
HOW THEY CREATED THE HULK.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.592
LOOK, WANDA AND I HAVE LUNCH
OCCASIONALLY.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.060
WHAT--WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.662
BECAUSE NOW THAT SHE KNOWS
ABOUT THE VINEYARD,

06:01.695 --> 06:05.399
SHE'S SQUEEZING ED'S GRAPES
FOR MORE MONEY.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.600
SHE'S ENTITLED TO HALF OF IT.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.736
SHE DID SHARE PART OF HER LIFE
WITH ED.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.004
I SHARED PART OF MY LIFE WITH
A GUY IN LINE AT THE D.M.V.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.206
WHAT DO I OWE HIM?

06:13.240 --> 06:16.544
I-I THINK WHAT SHE'S ASKING FOR
IS FAIR.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.945
NO, WHAT IT IS IS EXTORTION.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.246
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DIDN'T MAKE UP THE RULES.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.347
WELL, YOUR KIND DID.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.683
MY KIND?
YEAH, YOUR KIND.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.952
YOU THINK MEN INVENTED
THIS STUPID SYSTEM?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.755
MIKE, SHE PUT HER CAREER
ON HOLD FOR HIM.

06:27.788 --> 06:31.459
SHE WAS A BOAT MODEL.
SHE POINTED OUT TROLLING MOTORS.

06:31.492 --> 06:35.563
YEAH, AND SHE GAVE IT UP
BECAUSE OF ED.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.730
SHE GAVE IT UP
'CAUSE OF GRAVITY.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.865
OH, GOD.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.932
RIGHT.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.468
WHY ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH HER
ANYWAY?

06:40.501 --> 06:41.702
WE GOT ED IN THE DIVORCE.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.571
NO. NO. NO. NO.
YOU GOT ED. I GOT WANDA.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.372
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.575
WHEN FRIENDS OF OURS GET
DIVORCED, WE GOTTA PICK A SIDE.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.444
OH, AND WHO MADE UP THAT RULE?
YOUR KIND?

06:50.478 --> 06:52.980
YEAH,
BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.548
OH.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.584
THE FULLERS GOT DIVORCED.
WHO'D WE GET? ROB, RIGHT?

06:56.617 --> 06:59.052
THE BEDFORDS GOT DIVORCED,
"ADIOS, ALBERT."

06:59.086 --> 07:00.988
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
DISRESPECTFUL TO ED.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.223
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE LOYAL
TO ED?
BECAUSE I WORK WITH HIM.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.460
HE'S MY GOOD FRIEND. YOU GOTTA
HAVE HIS BACK ON THIS.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.495
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT IF I DON'T?
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA DIVORCE ME

07:07.528 --> 07:09.663
AND GIVE ME HALF YOUR STUFF?
OH!

07:09.697 --> 07:11.098
HUH? WELL, ALL RIGHT!

07:11.131 --> 07:13.501
LOOK AT THIS.
TOXIC WANDA'S POISON

07:13.534 --> 07:15.636
GLIDES ITSELF INTO OUR LIFE.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.170
WE NEVER FIGHT.
TALKING ABOUT DIVORCE?

07:17.204 --> 07:18.606
I DON'T WANT YOU
SEEING HER ANYMORE,

07:18.639 --> 07:20.240
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GETTING
ALL GINNED UP AT LUNCH.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.675
OH, REALLY? OH.
(scoffs)

07:21.709 --> 07:24.645
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY TELLING ME
WHO I CAN HANG OUT WITH?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.514
I'M SAYING WHO YOU CAN'T
HANG OUT WITH...
OH.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.583
WANDA, ANN FULLER,
AND ALBERT.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.684
(scoffs) OH.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.528
MANDY,
YOU HAVE CUSTOMERS WAITING.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.029
NOBODY CARES
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.032
THAT'S NOT THE FEEDBACK
I'VE BEEN GETTING.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.967
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO BE PERFECT
ON THE FIRST DAY,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.336
BUT YOU MAKE ME LOOK BAD
WHEN YOU SCREW UP.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.139
OH, MAN. SHE SCREWED UP ALREADY,
AND I MISSED IT?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.107
CAN YOU GET HER
TO DO IT AGAIN?

07:54.141 --> 07:57.144
OH, NEVER MIND.
SHE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.179
ARE YOU JUST HERE
TO MAKE FUN OF ME?

07:59.212 --> 08:01.348
HELLS, YEAH,
BUT I ALSO WANT A BURGER.

08:01.381 --> 08:05.452
CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT?
BURGER.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.056
LET ME GUESS. FOUR WATERS
AND AN ORDER OF FIRES TO SPLIT?

08:09.089 --> 08:11.358
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, LADY?

08:11.391 --> 08:13.060
YOU'RE HERE EVERY DAY,
YOU NEVER LEAVE A TIP,

08:13.093 --> 08:14.728
AND WE HAD GEOMETRY TOGETHER,
BOBBY,

08:14.762 --> 08:17.330
SO DON'T CALL ME "LADY."

08:17.364 --> 08:19.366
HERE YOU GO.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.168
YOU KNOW WHAT? I REALLY LIKE
YOUR TRUCKER HAT,

08:21.201 --> 08:23.170
BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE AN ACTUAL TRUCKER

08:23.203 --> 08:26.974
AND NOT JUST, LIKE, SOME HIPSTER
WEARING IT IRONICALLY.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.008
WELL, THANKS, DARLIN'.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.578
AREN'T YOU
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR?

08:30.611 --> 08:33.013
(giggles)
WOW. YOU REALLY GET ME.
(chuckles)

08:33.046 --> 08:34.347
ENJOY.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.549
YEAH.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.651
WAIT. DIDN'T YOU
ORDER WAFFLES, RON?

08:37.685 --> 08:40.854
YEP.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.190
THIS IS A TUNA MELT.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.059
BUT SHE SMOTHERED IT IN SYRUP.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.427
LET ME GET YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.262
NAW. I DON'T WANT TO GET
THAT NICE GIRL IN TROUBLE.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.664
THAT'S FINE.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.965
IT'S NOT FINE.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.942
(laughs) AND YOU THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA SCREW UP, HUH?

09:01.975 --> 09:04.111
HERE'S YOUR NACHOS.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.917
I JUST HAD A MEETING WITH WANDA
AND HER LAWYER.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.419
THEY COMPLETELY SCREWED ME,

09:12.452 --> 09:15.522
AND THEN I WROTE THEM
A CHECK.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.727
I FELT LIKE THE WORLD'S
DUMBEST PROSTITUTE.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.864
HEY, DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.
THAT'S WHAT YOUR PIMP IS FOR.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.734
THAT DEMON WOMAN
HAS REALLY GOT ME RATTLED.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.035
BUT YOU PAID HER OFF. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DEAL WITH HER AGAIN.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.737
CASE IS CLOSED, ED.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.104
YOU KNOW
I'M A GENTLEMAN, MIKE,

09:31.138 --> 09:34.207
BUT THAT RED DRESS
SHE WAS WEARING--

09:34.241 --> 09:38.045
I KEEP PICTURING IT ON THE FLOOR
NEXT TO MY FIREPLACE.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.214
WAS SHE BURNING
IN THE FIREPLACE?

09:41.248 --> 09:46.086
'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY STORY
THAT MAKES ANY SENSE TO ME.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.588
YOU KNOW, SEEING WANDA AGAIN
HAS AWAKENED A PASSION IN ME.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.824
ED. ED. ED.
I'M HAVING--
I'M HAVING STIRRINGS, MIKE.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.193
UNMEDICATED STIRRINGS.

09:54.995 --> 09:55.963
IT SHOCKED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.565
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING
PICKPOCKETED.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.768
ED, LISTEN TO ME.
SHE'S TOXIC FOR YOU.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.736
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.171
ALL RIGHT.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.505
GO AHEAD.
THEN TALK ME OUT OF IT, MIKE.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.175
TELL ME WHY I SHOULDN'T
FALL IN LOVE WITH HER AGAIN.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.010
SHE STABBED YOU.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.481
I HAD IT COMING.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.450
I TRIED TO FIX HER PROBLEM
INSTEAD OF JUST LISTENING.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.420
SHE DIDN'T COOK...
MM-HMM.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.756
SHE DIDN'T CLEAN YOUR HOUSE,
SHE SPENT ALL YOUR MONEY,

10:22.790 --> 10:25.125
AND... (laughs)

10:25.158 --> 10:27.995
SHE STABB YOU.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.999
(exhales deeply)

10:32.032 --> 10:33.600
YOU'RE RIGHT, MIKE.
YEAH.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.868
I'M NOT GONNA PURSUE HER.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.770
YOU'RE A TRUE FRIEND, MIKE.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.139
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT
YOU AND VANESSA BEING SO LOYAL.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.709
WELL, I'M THERE FOR YOU.
I SURE AM. I'M THERE.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.043
YOU AND VANESSA.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.311
WELL, I'M THERE, ANYWAY.
IT'S NOT--IT'S--

10:44.344 --> 10:47.147
ED, HOLD A SECOND.
(sighs)

10:47.180 --> 10:48.481
MM-HMM?

10:48.515 --> 10:50.050
TURNS OUT THAT, UH,

10:50.083 --> 10:51.785
VANESSA'S THE ONE
BEEN TALKING TO WANDA.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.321
THEY SEE EACH OTHER
QUITE A BIT.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.023
VANESSA BETRAYED ME?

10:56.056 --> 10:59.159
I THOUGHT YOU GOT ME
IN THE DIVORCE.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.163
THIS IS LIKE A KNIFE
IN MY HEART,

11:03.196 --> 11:04.464
AND THANKS TO WANDA,

11:04.497 --> 11:07.034
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.109
ED.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.878
(singsongy) SURPRISE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:17.911 --> 11:20.080
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO YOUR OFFICE BEFORE.

11:20.113 --> 11:24.351
IT'S, UH, IT'S NOT WHAT
I PICTURED FOR A GEOLOGIST.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.587
I THOUGHT...
THERE'D BE MORE ROCKS.

11:27.620 --> 11:32.025
ED, I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.061
I KNOW. I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME
FOR SPILLING THE BEANS TO WANDA,

11:34.094 --> 11:37.030
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED
TO HIDE ASSETS FROM HER.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.366
SHE GAVE UP BOAT SHOWS
FOR YOU.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.168
I KNOW. I KNOW.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.370
SHE WAS THE BEST POINTER
IN THE BUSINESS.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.740
WHEN SHE KICKED ME OUT, I HAD
NO TROUBLE FINDING THE DOOR.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.708
LISTEN...

11:48.742 --> 11:50.978
YOU GOTTA HELP ME
GET HER BACK.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.015
YOU WANT TO GET BACK
WITH WANDA?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.350
BEING AROUND WANDA
HAS REKINDLED A FIRE IN ME

11:57.384 --> 12:00.754
THAT--THAT THE DEEPEST OCEAN
CANNOT QUENCH.

12:00.788 --> 12:04.357
ED, SHE MADE YOU CRAZY
AND INSANELY JEALOUS. COME ON.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.960
YOU BEAT UP THE MAILMAN
AND THE POOL MAN

12:06.994 --> 12:09.196
AND THAT POOR GARDENER.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.065
WELL, THAT GARDENER
ALSO KILLED MY AZALEAS.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.635
VANESSA, I'LL DO BETTER,
I SWEAR.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.905
THE LAST TIME WANDA
AND I WERE TOGETHER,

12:17.938 --> 12:21.141
I WAS A HEADSTRONG KID
IN MY 60s.

12:21.174 --> 12:25.645
I'VE DONE A LOT OF GROWING UP
SINCE THEN. (chuckles)

12:25.678 --> 12:27.114
LOOK, VANESSA, PLEASE.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.449
I KNOW WANDA AND I HAVE
A TURBULENT HISTORY...
MM.

12:29.482 --> 12:33.086
BUT--BUT WE KEEP CIRCLING BACK
INTO EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.988
IT WAS MEANT TO BE,

12:35.022 --> 12:38.826
LIKE YOU AND MIKE.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.164
WOW. IT'S ROMANTIC.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.133
YOU DO SOUND SINCERE, ED.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.101
I AM SINCERE.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.771
AND HAVING A GRAVELLY VOICE
DOESN'T HURT.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.775
PLEASE, WILL YOU TALK
TO HER FOR ME?

12:58.846 --> 13:00.080
I HAVE TO TELL YOU...

13:00.113 --> 13:01.248
HMM?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.151
I THINK WANDA
WANTS YOU BACK, TOO.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.185
THAT'S MY ANSWER.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.420
MM.
THANK YOU, VANESSA. MWAH!

13:07.454 --> 13:09.022
THANK--THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.925
OH. (laughs) I, UH,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.994
I BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU
AS A BRIBE,

13:14.027 --> 13:15.963
BUT I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT
TO YOU ANYWAY.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.297
OH, ED.
YEAH, I...

13:17.330 --> 13:19.199
WHEN I TALKED TO THE GUY
AT THE ROCK STORE.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.601
HE SAID
IT WAS THE NICEST ONE.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.143
(voice vibrating) OH!

13:30.177 --> 13:31.979
(normal voice) OH, BOYD,
THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.481
YOU ARE GONNA MAKE
A GREAT HUSBAND SOMEDAY.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.317
DO I HAVE TO MARRY A GIRL?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.320
DEPENDS ON WHICH STATE
YOU LIVE IN.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.057
WHEN DID BOYD GET HERE?

13:44.091 --> 13:47.294
FIVE YEARS AGO. YOU HAVE NOT
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.962
UH, RYAN JUST
DROPPED HIM OFF.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.664
OKAY, I MADE $73 TODAY.
IS THAT GOOD?

13:51.698 --> 13:54.734
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? YOU
GOT HALF OF THE ORDERS WRONG.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.836
BUT I GOT HALF THE ORDERS
RIGHT. HUH?

13:56.870 --> 14:00.073
(laughs) SEE,
IT'S MY POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.842
HEY, KRIS, I THINK I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE NOT MAKING MORE TIPS.

14:02.876 --> 14:06.980
UM, OKAY, HOW DO I SAY THIS
WITHOUT USING THE WORD "BITCHY"?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.917
HMM, HOW DO I RESPOND WITHOUT
USING THE WORD "STRANGLE"?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.051
(gasps)

14:11.084 --> 14:14.087
(singsongy) THERE'S THAT
"DON'T TIP ME" ATTITUDE.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.890
IT'S HARD TO BE OODLES OF FUN
WHEN YOU'RE EXHAUSTED

14:16.924 --> 14:19.259
AND FRUSTRATED AND YOU HAVE
GRAVY STUCK IN YOUR HAIR.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.995
GOD, I HOPE THIS IS GRAVY.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.397
I DON'T KNOW. WHEN I GET GRUMPY,
I JUST THINK ABOUT

14:24.431 --> 14:25.732
ALL THE GOOD THINGS
IN MY LIFE,

14:25.765 --> 14:27.935
YOU KNOW,
LIKE MY TRIP TO CANCUN.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.836
YEAH, I CAN'T AFFORD TO THINK
ABOUT THINGS LIKE VACATIONS

14:29.869 --> 14:31.071
AND THROWING DOWN
A HUNDRED BUCKS

14:31.104 --> 14:32.839
ON A PAIR OF EXPENSIVE SHOES.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.007
(laughs)

14:34.041 --> 14:37.277
IT'S SO CUTE
YOU THINK THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.012
I AM SAVING EVERY PENNY

14:39.046 --> 14:41.548
SO THAT BOYD AND I CAN MOVE
INTO A PLACE OF OUR OWN.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.518
I'M A MOM WHO STILL LIVES
WITH HER MOM. IT'S HUMILIATING.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.187
I'M--I'M JUST NOT
WHERE I THOUGHT I'D BE

14:47.220 --> 14:48.855
AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.091
I KNOW.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.094
HEY, I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, HUH?
(kisses) BYE.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.796
UH, HEY. I HAVE
TO WORK ANOTHER SHIFT.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.598
CAN YOU TAKE BOYD HOME
WITH YOU?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.367
SURE.
I'M AN AWESOME WAITRESS.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.969
PRETTY SURE I'M GONNA BE GREAT
AT THE WHOLE MOMMY THING, TOO.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.470
(laughs)

15:03.503 --> 15:05.638
UH, UH,
DON'T FORGET THE KID!

15:07.007 --> 15:10.443
I WOULD'VE REMEMBERED.
(laughs) COME ON.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.280
HEY.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.149
HEY. I AM SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.085
I MADE YOUR FAVORITE DINNER.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.619
SOMETHING SMELLS GREAT
IN HERE.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.422
WELL, IT'S EITHER ME
OR THE LASAGNA.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.257
WELL, I LOVE
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS--

15:24.291 --> 15:26.526
ONE A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN THE OTHER.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.098
DON'T FEEL BAD. I'VE KNOWN
LASAGNA A LOT LONGER.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.565
HMM.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.766
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.502
THAT'S RIGHT,
BECAUSE I PREVENTED ED

15:35.535 --> 15:37.404
FROM MAKING A BIG MISTAKE--
A BIG BALL-BUSTING MISTAKE

15:37.437 --> 15:40.007
WITH GRAY ROOTS
AND A BOOB JOB.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.175
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WANDA,

15:42.209 --> 15:44.644
IT WAS A BOOB REDUCTION.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.147
ANOTHER HORRIBLE THING
SHE DID TO ED.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.918
YOU KNOW, HE ACTUALLY WANTED
TO GET BACK WITH HER.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.586
YEAH. I KNOW. I KNOW.
HE CAME TO MY OFFICE TODAY...

15:53.620 --> 15:55.088
WHAT?
AND ASKED ME FOR MY HELP.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.656
YEAH.
YOUR OFFICE?

15:56.689 --> 15:58.025
YEAH.
AFTER I TALKED HIM OUT OF IT?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.527
WELL...
BOY, WHAT'S WITH THAT WOMAN?

16:00.560 --> 16:01.961
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
SHE'S OUT OF YOUR LIFE,

16:01.995 --> 16:03.830
SHE POPS BACK UP.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.999
IT'S LIKE SHINGLES.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.867
OR WORSE, THE CLINTONS.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.471
BUT YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH
NOT TO CALL HER, RIGHT?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.805
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WASN'T GOING TO,

16:12.839 --> 16:15.142
BUT MY GOD,
HE WAS SO SINCERE.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.509
SHE STABB HIM.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.879
YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME
TO BE LOYAL TO ED.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.182
WELL, HOW IS THIS
BEING LOYAL TO ED?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.983
WELL, BECAUSE
I DID WHAT HE WANTED.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.652
WHEN HE'S WITH HER,
HE'S MISERABLE.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.321
WHEN HE'S MISERABLE, YOU KNOW
WHO HE TAKES IT OUT ON?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.890
OH, SO YOUR DEFINITION
OF BEING LOYAL TO ED

16:30.923 --> 16:32.725
IS DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU?

16:32.759 --> 16:33.960
NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.696
JUST ASK YOURSELF--
WHAT WOULD MIKE WANT?

16:36.729 --> 16:39.666
(scoffs)
I'LL--I'LL MAKE
A LITTLE BRACELET FOR YOU.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.000
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ED WANTS?
COME ON. HE WANTS HER.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.536
SHE WANTS HIM. I THINK THEY
REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.737
(doorbell rings)
THAT'S NOT LOVE.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.739
THAT'S COMBUSTION.
THAT'S DRAMA.

16:46.773 --> 16:51.544
PASSION IN A RELATIONSHIP
IS NEVER A GOOD THING.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.480
PASSION SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD

16:53.513 --> 16:56.049
TO A WOMAN COMING IN SECOND
TO A LASAGNA.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.887
LISTEN, OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS A MILLION TIMES HEALTHIER

17:00.920 --> 17:02.522
THAN THEIRS, RIGHT?
(ring)

17:02.555 --> 17:05.058
WE'RE SLOW AND STEADY,
LIKE THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.259
OH, SO I'M A TORTOISE NOW?

17:06.293 --> 17:08.561
I'M A HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD,
CLAW-FOOTED REPTILE?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.063
WHO WINS THE RACE.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.431
(ring)

17:11.464 --> 17:13.166
AREN'T YOU GUYS GONNA
GET THE DOOR?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.367
YEAH, WE WILL, EVENTUALLY.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.036
WE TORTOISES ARE
NOTORIOUSLY SLOW.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.773
EW!

17:20.807 --> 17:21.774
EITHER THEY'RE KISSING,
OR ED IS DYING,

17:21.808 --> 17:23.710
AND SHE'S TRYING TO REVIVE HIM.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.213
HI.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.780
HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

17:27.814 --> 17:31.551
THANKS.
WE HAVE GREAT NEWS.
WANDA AND I HAVE RECONCILED.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.421
IN CASE YOU COULDN'T TELL
BY ALL THE FRENCHING.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.689
LISTEN, NOW WE--
NOW WE--WE CAN'T STAY.
NO, WE CAN'T STAY.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.191
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO DINNER.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.892
BUT, VANESSA...
(clears throat)

17:39.926 --> 17:41.060
WE WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE FIRST BOTTLE

17:41.094 --> 17:42.929
FROM OUR NEW VINTAGE.
YEAH.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.897
OH.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.199
"EDNA"?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.868
YEAH, IT'S A BLENDING
OF OUR FIRST NAMES.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.037
WORKS THE SAME WAY
THOSE GRAPES WERE BLENDED

17:51.070 --> 17:53.373
TO PRODUCE THAT FINE SYRAH
THERE.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.774
IT'S OUR WAY
OF SAYING THANK YOU

17:54.807 --> 17:56.209
FOR HELPING
TO BRING US BACK TOGETHER.

17:56.243 --> 17:59.812
YEAH, DESPITE ALL THE OBSTACLES
THAT WERE THROWN IN OUR PATH.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.381
NOW, NOW,
COME ON NOW, SWEETIE.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.982
MIKE'S HEART'S
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.084
FORTUNATELY MINE'S HANGS
A LITTLE TO THE LEFT,

18:05.118 --> 18:07.053
WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON
I'M ALIVE.

18:07.086 --> 18:11.124
HE TRIED TO KEEP US APART, ED.
HE CALLED ME TOXIC.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
THAT--THAT'S TAKEN
OUT OF CONTEXT.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.461
OH, REALLY?
WHAT WAS THE CONTEXT?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.896
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
BURNING YOU IN A FIRE.
OKAY.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.431
NEVER MIND.
OH, THAT'S FABULOUS.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.066
WELL, HE'S A HORRIBLE PERSON.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.268
HEY, GUYS, THIS IS
THE KIND OF CONVERSATION

18:21.301 --> 18:23.436
YOU WANT TO HAVE
IN THE RIDE HOME.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.572
LET'S GO, EDDIE. COME ON.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.175
I DON'T WANT YOU SOCIALIZING
WITH HIM ANYMORE.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.143
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHO TO BE FRIENDS WITH.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.611
HE IS THE ENEMY OF LOVE!

18:31.644 --> 18:33.313
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
(speaks indistinctly)

18:33.346 --> 18:36.115
(Ed) WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT LOVE, YOU BOAT MODEL?

18:36.149 --> 18:38.251
(chuckles)

18:38.285 --> 18:39.652
NOW IT'S COMING BACK TO ME.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.154
YEAH, YOU GET IT NOW?

18:41.188 --> 18:43.356
SLOW AND STEADY--THAT'S WHAT--
THAT'S WHAT WINS THE RACE.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.192
SLOW AND STEADY.
MM, THAT'S OUR STYLE.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.759
SLOW AND STEADY, BABY.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.461
YEAH. MMM.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.829
EW!

18:51.164 --> 18:53.099
THERE REALLY
SHOULD BE AN AGE LIMIT.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.969
"EW"? HONEY, THIS IS
THE MAGIC THAT MADE YOU.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.672
OH, MY GOD.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.108
(both laugh)

19:02.141 --> 19:03.810
(Kristin) OH.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.144
(door closes)

19:05.178 --> 19:08.848
LOOK WHO'S UP FOUR HOURS
PAST HIS BEDTIME.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.783
HOW MANY POPSICLES
HAVE YOU EATEN?

19:10.817 --> 19:13.520
SEVEN!

19:13.553 --> 19:17.290
GO WASH YOUR FACE. GO.

19:17.324 --> 19:21.194
NO. OHH, MAN.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.731
I HURT ALL OVER. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.633
I DO. YOU WORKED.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.634
OH.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.068
AND THEN I CAME HOME

19:29.101 --> 19:32.138
AND I CHASED THAT MONKEY AROUND
FOR HOURS.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.640
OH, MY GOD. WHERE'D HE GO?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.675
HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.578
OH, GOD. WHERE?

19:38.611 --> 19:42.582
(Boyd) MOM! SOMEBODY PUT
THE TOILET PAPER IN THE TOILET!

19:42.615 --> 19:44.150
BE RIGHT THERE!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.619
DON'T GO IN AFTER IT!

19:48.087 --> 19:50.657
KRISTIN,
YOUR LIFE IS HORRIBLE.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.826
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
SO HERE.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.395
YOUR TIPS?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.930
YEAH.
IT'S FOR YOUR APARTMENT FUND.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.667
(sniffles)
UH, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.736
SAY, "MANDY, YOU ARE NOT ONLY
BEAUTIFUL ON THE OUTSIDE,

20:03.770 --> 20:05.438
BUT YOU ARE ALSO BEAUTIFUL
ON THE INSIDE."

20:05.472 --> 20:07.407
SAY THAT. OKAY?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.342
MANDY...
YEAH.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.245
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
INSIDE AND OUT.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.114
YOU KIND OF BUTCHERED IT,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.783
HERE. YOU EARNED THIS.

20:16.816 --> 20:21.288
GO TO CANCUN. DRINK CERVEZAS
AND SHOW OFF THOSE TATAS.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.855
ARE YOU SURE?

20:22.889 --> 20:25.024
COME ON, KRIS. THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO TO HELP YOU.

20:25.057 --> 20:29.095
YOU CAN FISH THAT ROLL OF
TOILET PAPER OUT OF THE TOILET.

20:29.128 --> 20:32.098
JUST PLEASE TAKE THE CASH.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.937
(Boyd) MOM, I'M FLUSHING,
BUT IT'S NOT GOING DOWN!
(toilet flushing)

20:39.105 --> 20:40.940
I'M GOING IN AFTER IT!

20:48.481 --> 20:49.616
LISTEN,
IN THIS DIVORCE OF OURS,

20:49.649 --> 20:50.950
WHICH IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN...
OKAY.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.319
WHO WOULD GET THE GLICKMANS?

20:52.352 --> 20:54.053
WELL,
I WOULD GET THE GLICKMANS

20:54.086 --> 20:56.155
BECAUSE JEN AND I HAVE BEEN
BEST FRIENDS SINCE COLLEGE.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.425
YEAH, BUT CHRIS HAS
THOSE NUGGETS TICKETS.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.159
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU CAN HAVE THE GLICKMANS.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.761
YES!
BUT I GET THE SCHMIDTS.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.096
I DON'T CARE.
THEY HAVE
THAT EXCELLENT WINE COLLECTION.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.799
WHAT IS WITH YOU AND WINE?

21:06.833 --> 21:10.637
HAVE YOU TRIED BEING MARRIED
TO YOU?

21:10.670 --> 21:11.971
WHAT ABOUT THE MILLERS?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.606
THEY ARE ALL YOURS.
I DON'T WANT 'EM.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.275
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THEM.
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THEM.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.244
AREN'T WE HAVING DINNER
WITH THEM TOMORROW NIGHT?

21:18.277 --> 21:19.979
(scoffs) NOT ANYMORE.
WE BOTH HATE THEM.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.614
YOU SHOULD CALL THEM.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.783
JUST CALL THEM AND TELL THEM
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE THERE.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.017
I'M NOT GONNA CALL THEM.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.953
THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.656
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL JUST GO.
ALL RIGHT.
