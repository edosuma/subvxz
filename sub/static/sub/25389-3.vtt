00:01.860 --> 00:04.169
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:04.200 --> 00:05.394
(grunts)

00:05.430 --> 00:07.739
(tires squealing)

00:07.770 --> 00:09.237
Get in the car.
Now!

00:09.270 --> 00:10.965
Last time we met, you
offered me a partnership.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.898
And you tried to kill me.

00:12.940 --> 00:14.828
IfI really wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead, you know that.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.905
CAMILA: Teresa was
a stray mutt when I met her.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.339
Let her die in the cold
with the other dogs.

00:19.380 --> 00:21.678
What does a girl like you
have to offer me?

00:21.720 --> 00:25.349
The book
your husband's been after.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.857
You deal in
cryptocurrencnes?

00:26.890 --> 00:29.051
When it comes to
making money disappear,

00:29.090 --> 00:31.923
I'm as close to perfection
as our world allowed us.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.155
CORTEZ: Valletta, Malta.
The authorities took notice

00:34.200 --> 00:37.169
of a Somali crew landing at
a port in Valletta last month.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.020
King George uses Somalis.

00:39.070 --> 00:40.594
You can be my Pocahontas.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.437
GEORGE: Or maybe I'll be
your Pocahontas.

00:42.470 --> 00:44.358
POTE: How did you get away?
-James.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.173
-Where is he now?
-In the trunk.

00:46.210 --> 00:48.576
POTE: Attagirl.
I'm leaving now.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.840
(tense music)

00:50.880 --> 00:53.815
(speaking Spanish)

00:55.380 --> 00:56.608
(grunting)

00:57.920 --> 01:02.254
(speaking Spanish)

01:02.930 --> 01:06.195
And there was only ever one way
for this to end for you.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.619
(gunshots, men grunting)

01:08.660 --> 01:12.130
(speaking Spanish)

01:12.170 --> 01:18.632
*

01:21.440 --> 01:23.101
(grunting, groaning)

01:23.150 --> 01:24.174
(blow lands)

01:24.750 --> 01:27.719
(eerie music)

01:27.750 --> 01:28.944
(Taser buzzes)

01:28.980 --> 01:30.982
MAN: (speaking Spanish)

01:36.090 --> 01:37.250
POTE: (yells)

01:38.090 --> 01:41.127
(groans)

01:46.600 --> 01:48.795
(grunts)

01:50.140 --> 01:51.607
(groans)

01:51.640 --> 01:54.131
Welcome back.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.444
How long have I been out?
(grunts)

01:56.480 --> 01:58.607
Hey.

01:58.650 --> 02:00.743
How long?

02:05.120 --> 02:06.109
Ugh.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.987
(grunts)

02:10.030 --> 02:12.328
The doctor said
to keep the bandage on.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.590
He said you might need surgery.

02:14.630 --> 02:16.461
(speaking Spanish)

02:21.370 --> 02:25.602
I wanna find those pendejos
and make 'em pay.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.130
JAMES: Might be hard.
They're both dead.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.842
(groans)

02:29.880 --> 02:31.871
He's with us now.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.251
I need you to trust me, okay?

02:41.190 --> 02:43.329
You need to rest
and get your strength back.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.055
Teresita.

02:45.090 --> 02:47.194
You're no use to me broken.

02:49.530 --> 02:52.988
You listen to me, pendejo,

02:53.040 --> 02:54.530
you betray us again
and I will carve you

02:54.570 --> 02:57.038
like a freaking cochinito.

02:57.070 --> 02:58.833
Do you understand?

02:58.870 --> 03:00.735
(ominous music)

03:00.780 --> 03:02.338
Lay down.

03:02.380 --> 03:05.076
(grunts)

03:05.110 --> 03:08.079
*

03:08.120 --> 03:10.315
Listen to me.

03:10.350 --> 03:13.012
We have an important meeting.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.585
Rocco's gonna show us
his banking system.

03:15.620 --> 03:18.180
Cryptocurrency.

03:18.230 --> 03:19.822
You sure you can trust him?

03:19.860 --> 03:21.748
He saved our lives.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.768
But I'm not gonna trust him

03:23.800 --> 03:25.563
until he proves
his system works.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.329
And you wanna get
a proof of concept?

03:27.370 --> 03:28.837
Yeah.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.201
How much are_
you planning to gIve

03:30.240 --> 03:32.276
the pinche loco magician?

03:32.310 --> 03:35.905
If his system checks out,

03:35.940 --> 03:38.374
I'll put $20 million
with his bank.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.116
The rest I'll keep liquid.

03:40.150 --> 03:42.618
Smart.
Won't be tied down in Malta.

03:42.650 --> 03:46.689
Yeah. That way we can operate
anywhere in the world.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.723
POTE: Teresita.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.853
"We"?

03:51.890 --> 03:54.222
(tense music)

03:54.260 --> 03:57.627
Let's get some rest, okay?

03:57.670 --> 04:00.935
I'll be back soon.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.234
Let's go.

04:03.270 --> 04:10.278
*

04:11.350 --> 04:13.944
That pompous bastard.

04:13.980 --> 04:16.710
He thinks he can
keep Teresa from me.

04:16.750 --> 04:20.151
I want you to go to Malta,
General.

04:20.190 --> 04:23.079
Tear her from his fingers.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.985
Rocco de la Pea is
a powerful and dangerous man.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.793
It would be folly
to pick a fight with him

04:27.830 --> 04:29.468
in his own backyard.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.469
_ You'r_e scared of a
foreign hooligan more than me?

04:32.500 --> 04:34.058
(chuckles)

04:34.100 --> 04:37.001
You don't need more enemies
at this moment.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.804
Let de la Pea
grow bored with her.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.843
Right now you must stay
focused on the real enemy.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.849
Boaz Jimenez must be
your first concern.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.974
I decide who my real enemy is,
not you.

04:50.220 --> 04:52.484
Boaz is just a stupid bull.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.408
But he's a bull with
a spear in his side,

04:54.460 --> 04:56.018
and he is in the ring with you.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.449
Do not turn your back to him.

04:58.490 --> 05:01.493
If you don't help me,

05:01.530 --> 05:04.499
I'll find someone who will.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.862
(foreboding music)

05:06.900 --> 05:09.334
(speaking Spanish)

05:09.370 --> 05:11.838
Revenge is like any drug.

05:11.870 --> 05:15.203
It can please you,
or it can rule you.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.971
Obsession will kill logic
when you need it most.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.478
CAMILA: Teresa is just
a stray dog, General.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.183
It's time we put her down.

05:25.220 --> 05:32.228
*

05:35.430 --> 05:36.897
(electronic music)

05:36.930 --> 05:38.659
TERESA: Most money launderers

05:38.700 --> 05:40.793
use businesses to clean
their clients' cash.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.808
Hotels, restaurants, retail.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.638
Rocco de la Pea
uses the internet.

05:45.670 --> 05:46.671
He claims it's safe.

05:46.710 --> 05:49.133
JAMES: We'll see.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.704
Your offline servers are here?

05:50.750 --> 05:52.411
Downstairs in my vault.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.179
Impenetrable.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.688
JAMES: If the servers overheat,
we could lose everything.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.745
What if
the cooling system fails?

05:58.790 --> 06:01.486
I have a contingency.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.523
All rooms are individually
vacuum sealed,

06:04.560 --> 06:07.427
pulling all owgen out
within seconds,

06:07.460 --> 06:10.725
instantly
extinguishing any threat.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.193
(vault dings)

06:13.240 --> 06:16.164
Let's start with
your current methods,

06:16.200 --> 06:19.431
which, frankly,
are fraught with risk.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.209
For example,

06:21.240 --> 06:22.548
the payments
to your Bolivian supplier.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.207
MAN: Let's go.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.206
ROCCO: Though you get
major style points

06:26.250 --> 06:28.411
for your use
of Somali pirates,

06:28.450 --> 06:30.247
there are some glaring

06:30.290 --> 06:31.382
_ vulnerabilities
In your system...

06:31.420 --> 06:33.217
(man shouts)
(gunshots)

06:33.260 --> 06:35.114
(men grunting)
(gunshots)

06:35.160 --> 06:39.597
_ That can result
In the loss of your assets.

06:39.630 --> 06:42.929
-Let's say you wanna deposit--
-$3 million.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.189
Into my account,
and I purchase $3 million--

06:46.230 --> 06:48.232
in which coin do you prefer?

06:48.270 --> 06:50.966
Ethereum and Bitcoin
have too much movement.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.602
I'm thinking Pteria.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.131
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

06:55.180 --> 06:59.617
So I deposit your coins
into your bank account.

06:59.650 --> 07:02.369
Right now, your
$3 million in Pteria

07:02.420 --> 07:06.208
is broken up into tiny pieces
of digital code

07:06.250 --> 07:09.583
and spread through
thousands of accounts,

07:09.630 --> 07:11.427
rendering it untraceable.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.894
What if I'd like
to make a withdrawal?

07:13.930 --> 07:16.626
You can withdraw cash,

07:16.670 --> 07:20.390
but I prefer

07:20.440 --> 07:24.228
carrying my millions
in one hand.

07:24.270 --> 07:27.103
*

07:27.140 --> 07:29.574
So all my money will be
in the hard drive?

07:29.610 --> 07:33.011
Yes, and only you will
be able to access it

07:33.050 --> 07:36.076
with a 54—character signature.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.180
Please, type it now.

07:39.220 --> 07:46.228
*

07:47.200 --> 07:50.966
Hit send,
and watch my magic work.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.865
(chatter in foreign language)

07:52.900 --> 07:55.767

07:55.800 --> 07:59.133

08:00.480 --> 08:01.401
(cell phone beeps)

08:01.880 --> 08:03.677
Yeah.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.143
GIRL: Teresa Mendoza...

08:05.180 --> 08:06.101
Gracias.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.368
(speaking Spanish)

08:11.650 --> 08:13.208
(cell phone beeps)

08:13.260 --> 08:15.251
My supplier just
got his payment.

08:16.690 --> 08:21.024
It's safer, faster,
quicker, better.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.369
Don't you wish cocaine
could be delivered...

08:23.400 --> 08:25.220
(clicks tongue)
digitally?

08:26.670 --> 08:28.160
We have a deal.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.009
Bravo.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.905
Welcome to the new world,
Teresa.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.034

08:35.080 --> 08:38.049

08:38.080 --> 08:40.913

-Hello.

08:40.950 --> 08:43.919
WOMAN: * What is happening?

08:43.950 --> 08:47.056
Hey, the $20 million
have been deposited.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.650
We made something here,
Teresita.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.226
You should be proud.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.352
Thank you.

08:52.390 --> 08:54.756
(distant laughter)

08:54.800 --> 08:58.668
Would you like a drink?

08:58.700 --> 09:00.361
I'm not thirsty.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.335
He'll come around.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.359
I know.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.247
Congratulations, Teresa.

09:16.280 --> 09:20.216
I see bright things
in your future.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.989
Salud.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.596
You are gonna
be huge in Europe.

09:26.630 --> 09:29.997
This is just the beginning.

09:31.630 --> 09:34.690
Just don't ever screw me.
Hmm?

09:34.740 --> 09:39.439
I do the screwing in my world,
okay?

09:39.470 --> 09:41.574
(glass shatters)
WOMAN: (gasps)

09:41.610 --> 09:43.805
(breathing shakily)

09:43.850 --> 09:46.045
*

09:46.080 --> 09:48.571
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

09:48.620 --> 09:52.579
ROCCO: Yvette is a rare Russian
who can't handle her booze.

09:52.620 --> 09:55.316
(snaps fingers)
Bring me another girl.

09:55.360 --> 09:59.057
WOMAN: * Breathe in

09:59.090 --> 10:02.059
Let's go.

10:02.100 --> 10:06.764
WOMAN: * What is happening?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.961
GUARD: Come on,
pull yourself together.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.034
MAN: Sorry about that, sir.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.144
Salud.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.716

10:25.320 --> 10:32.158

10:32.190 --> 10:33.157
Ladies' room.

Excuse me.

10:34.860 --> 10:40.594
WOMAN: * Fading out
of view now *

10:40.640 --> 10:45.634
* Losing you

10:47.540 --> 10:50.771

10:50.810 --> 10:53.608
WETI'E: I don't know
what happened out there.

10:53.650 --> 10:56.175
GUARD: Get up!
WETI'E: Please.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.780
I don't know.
I don't...

nd
Ah! 5)

11:00.990 --> 11:02.309

11:02.360 --> 11:04.328
Ugh.

11:11.070 --> 11:14.562
Yvette.
Yvette.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.397
Help me, please.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.532
We're dying.

11:17.570 --> 11:19.709
Did he hurt your back?

11:19.740 --> 11:23.244
WETI'E: He cuts all of us.
He gets off on it.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.202
He keeps us like slaves.
Please.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.616
(echoing slam)

11:28.250 --> 11:31.413
Come here.
Hey, we don't have much time.

11:31.450 --> 11:33.088
We have to go.
How many of you are here?

11:33.120 --> 11:36.157
WETI'E: Ten.
He does bad things to us.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.852
Then he give us drugs
to make it better.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.858
If they find you here--please.
Never mind.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.698
I don't know what I say.
Just--just go.

11:43.730 --> 11:45.197
Listen, I need you to trust me,
okay?

11:45.230 --> 11:47.767
-Are they all kept here?
-For now.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.008
-Tomorrow they send us away.
-Tomorrow how?

11:51.040 --> 11:53.929
We go on ship.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.572
Promise me you'll help us.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.908
Please.

11:57.950 --> 12:00.669
JAMES: Teresa.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.971
What's wrong?

12:03.090 --> 12:06.912
(dramatic music intensifies)

12:06.960 --> 12:08.757
(chimes tinkling)

12:14.400 --> 12:15.890
LOYA: Malta authorities
won't go near Teresa

12:15.930 --> 12:18.194
with de la Pea
protecting her.

12:18.230 --> 12:19.766
You're holding out on me.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.803
I'm doing everything
in my power.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.139
The DEA's operating
from the embassy in Malta.

12:26.170 --> 12:27.876
All I'm asking you is
to give them Teresa

12:27.910 --> 12:29.878
so she can be
extradited back to Mexico.

12:29.910 --> 12:33.038
Teresa saved your life
at that club.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.547
That don't mean nothing to you?

12:34.580 --> 12:37.708
(soft laugh)
Don't fool yourself.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.980
I was the only thing
keeping her alive.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.487
She was saving herself.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.319
All I'm asking you is to have
her sent back to the country

12:46.360 --> 12:48.794
where her crime was committed.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.991
Alonzo.

12:51.030 --> 12:53.464
You're a good man.

12:53.500 --> 12:57.607
You want her in jail.
So do I.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.972
I want her to rot,

13:00.010 --> 13:01.079
slowly.

13:01.110 --> 13:02.668
(menacing music)

13:02.710 --> 13:05.770
And I don't have
to bring her in myself.

13:05.810 --> 13:07.414
That can be you.

13:07.450 --> 13:09.338
That should be you.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.644
All I want is to visit her

13:11.690 --> 13:13.988
and smile,

13:14.020 --> 13:17.979
just to hear
how lonely and sad

13:18.030 --> 13:20.453
and pathetic her life is

13:20.500 --> 13:23.469
as often as I want.

13:23.500 --> 13:28.267
That means Teresa has
to come back to Mexico.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.938
I'm listening.

13:29.970 --> 13:31.665
Good.

13:31.710 --> 13:35.476
*

13:35.510 --> 13:38.547
This book

13:38.580 --> 13:41.344
brought Teresa
into my life.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.689
And now it's gonna
help me get rid of her.

13:46.890 --> 13:50.053
Teresa's operation
has a weakness.

13:51.590 --> 13:58.223
*

14:02.170 --> 14:05.469
MAN: (speaking
foreign language)

14:05.510 --> 14:06.829
(overlapping chatter)

14:06.880 --> 14:08.006
(ominous music)

14:08.040 --> 14:09.337
MAN: (yelling in Spanish)

14:09.380 --> 14:12.543
CAMILA: (speaking Spanish)

14:12.580 --> 14:15.242
TERESA: (screaming)
-(speaking Spanish)

14:15.280 --> 14:18.681
TERESA: No, no.
No!

14:18.720 --> 14:21.689
(seagull cawing)

14:36.240 --> 14:38.265
You have something to say?

14:38.310 --> 14:41.529
Teresita, things happen.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.673
This business is
ugly for girls. You have to--

14:43.710 --> 14:45.905
Girls have always been currency
with the cartel.

14:45.950 --> 14:48.043
We can save them,
but it won't change that.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.618
Don't you ever interrupt me
again, cabrn.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.117
Even if we save the girls
that Rocco has now,

14:53.160 --> 14:54.286
there's more where
that come from.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.208
It will never end.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.558
JAMES: Not to mention, you just
gave him most of the money.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.455
We can back away from the deal.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.627
But slowly, with caution.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.960
It's nice to see you two
agree on something.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.365
Just think about it.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.129
You once told me
I was better than Camila

15:10.170 --> 15:13.628
because I had a heart.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.773
This is what that looks like.

15:15.810 --> 15:18.973
It took us six months to build
what we have her in Malta.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.547
You burn Rocco
and you burn it all.

15:21.580 --> 15:25.289
If you burn Europe, you're
running out of continents.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.754
We agreed to do business
in a different way.

15:27.790 --> 15:31.055
But I don't think
this is about business.

15:31.090 --> 15:35.390
That girl was me
when you met me.

15:35.430 --> 15:38.092
I know what it's like
to be a slave,

15:38.130 --> 15:41.395
to people who don't give a shit
whether you live or die.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.464
(tense music)

15:42.500 --> 15:43.831
(car door opens and closes)

15:43.870 --> 15:45.235
GEORGE: Yo, principessa!

15:45.270 --> 15:46.908
The King has arrived.

15:46.940 --> 15:49.670
(speaking Spanish)

15:49.710 --> 15:51.940
Ugh, Teresa.

15:51.980 --> 15:55.677
Can I get an "amen"?
Where my dogs at?

15:55.720 --> 15:59.087
Oh, there he is.
Baby Chapo.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.917
Welcome back from
being a dipstick.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.109
POTE: (groans)

16:02.990 --> 16:05.356
What the shit happened to you?

16:05.390 --> 16:06.857
You try and hump a real Wookie?

16:06.890 --> 16:10.599
TERESA: George.
-Right. Plan time.

16:10.630 --> 16:13.190
So Yvette's information
was correct.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.037
Yep.
There's a cargo ship

16:15.070 --> 16:16.628
owned by one of
Rocco's subsidiaries

16:16.670 --> 16:18.331
leaving Port Senglea today.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.304
Now, it'll have less guards
than at the club.

16:20.340 --> 16:21.876
It'd be safer to get
the girls out there.

16:21.910 --> 16:23.502
JAMES: Why would he ship 'em?

16:23.550 --> 16:24.869
Why not just fly 'em?

16:24.910 --> 16:27.276
He makes twice the money
on them this way.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.881
He gets paid once for the trip,
when the crew uses them,

16:30.920 --> 16:33.480
then again when they get
to their destination.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.056
It's despicable.

16:35.090 --> 16:37.684
Bastards like Rocco ruin
the good name of smugglers.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.379
Now, my men and I
will take out the guards

16:39.430 --> 16:41.022
right here once
the girls are on the move.

16:41.060 --> 16:42.493
Then we need
to get out of Malta.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.623
Well, as we speak,

16:44.670 --> 16:47.059
my boys are parking
our escape vessel

16:47.100 --> 16:48.965
on the other side
of the port.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.558
Now, we'll load her up.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.805
The second this shit
goes belly up, ooh,

16:52.840 --> 16:54.569
we gotta skedaddle
mmamm

16:54.610 --> 16:56.202
JAMES: If Rocco knows
you're Involved,

16:56.240 --> 16:58.174
you'll lose the $20 million
you just gave him.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.542
That's why we need to get the
money out of the bank first.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.741
(exhales deeply)
You're putting yourself

17:02.780 --> 17:05.044
in a whole lot of danger just
to keep your conscience clean.

17:05.090 --> 17:08.150
Is that any worse than
doing it for the money?

17:08.190 --> 17:10.522
So we're robbing a bank?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.323
We're not robbing a bank.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.419
We're bringing guns?

17:14.460 --> 17:15.688
Yeah.

17:17.430 --> 17:20.490
Where are you going?

17:20.540 --> 17:24.601
I'm gonna go not
eat a sandwich.

17:31.110 --> 17:34.910
(speaking foreign language)

17:34.950 --> 17:36.611
I ain't going nowhere
without the snake.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.515
We're facing off against
a Maltese billionaire.

17:40.490 --> 17:43.357
Don't forget the egg case.

17:43.390 --> 17:46.257
(indistinct chatter)

17:50.000 --> 17:52.798
How're you holding up, darling?
On the real.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.798
I'm fine.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.637
Wonder Twins giving you grief?

17:56.670 --> 17:58.035
Bilal.

17:58.070 --> 18:00.300
Hit that.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.207
(chuckles)

18:03.250 --> 18:06.242
Pote and James will do
what needs to be done.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.044
No doubt.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.082
But for a man who ain't seen
below that mustache

18:11.120 --> 18:14.317
since he was nine,
he can get pretty lippy.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.487
Oh, they're just
scared for you is all.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.329
Psychopaths can be
unpredictable.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.918
Kind of like courageous women.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.622
I'm not being brave.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.867
If there was another way
to do this, I would.

18:26.630 --> 18:28.598
Your men seem loyal.

18:30.270 --> 18:33.433
They know where
their bread's buttered.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.835
So it's just for the money?

18:38.350 --> 18:42.070
Nah.
Them boys are special.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.940
We've been through
a lot together.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.982
But I'm always
straight with them.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.181
Like I gotta be
with you right now.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.450
What are you talking about?

18:51.490 --> 18:53.321
I did a run for Rocco
years back.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.499
And I didn't wanna say
anything in the house,

18:55.530 --> 18:57.464
but I think it's
important you know who

18:57.500 --> 18:59.661
you're clashing horns with.
-Why didn't you tell me?

18:59.700 --> 19:03.500
It don't affect the why you're
doing what you're doing.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.667
But it--it might just
affect the "if."

19:05.710 --> 19:08.508
-You hear me?
-Yeah, I'm listening.

19:08.540 --> 19:12.044
Rocco came up as an enforcer
in the Galician Mafia.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.139
Dark reputation even back then.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.717
I smuggled a payload
of Kalashnikovs

19:16.750 --> 19:18.843
to this Afghani rebel-rousers
they're trying to get

19:18.890 --> 19:20.482
to strike against
one of their competitors.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.954
Rocco had their
families cruciﬁed.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.288
Women, kids.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.218
Dude's got a thing
for blood.

19:27.260 --> 19:30.866
Now he passing himself off
as some kind of techno wizard.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.492
But the dude ain't changed.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.998
You understand why
I can't leave them behind?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.736
I do.
I get It.

19:39.770 --> 19:42.136
And we're all here for you.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.648
You just need to understand
what you're up against.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.841
The man's a goddamn spider.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.041
You walking right out
onto his web.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.742
(tense music)

19:51.790 --> 19:53.417
(speaking foreign language)

19:53.460 --> 19:55.189
Close her up.
Let's go.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.357
*

19:56.390 --> 19:57.379
(car door slams)

20:03.700 --> 20:07.329

20:07.370 --> 20:08.564

ISABELA: (giggling)

20:14.880 --> 20:18.043

20:18.080 --> 20:20.048
(both giggling)

20:20.080 --> 20:21.445
(speaking Spanish)

20:21.480 --> 20:22.447
(music halts)

20:31.160 --> 20:33.025
ISABELA: Mom, will you show us?

20:33.060 --> 20:36.791
My mom studied to be
a dancer when she was my age.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.526
-I didn't know that.
-(soft laugh)

20:39.570 --> 20:42.232
How about it, General?

20:42.270 --> 20:44.158
Will you help my mother
show us how it's done?

20:46.070 --> 20:47.537
(soft chuckle)

20:47.580 --> 20:51.641
*

20:51.680 --> 20:53.477
You're very light on your feet,
General.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.976
I'm impressed.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.443
You're the one
with the gifts, mi jefa.

20:57.490 --> 21:01.483
*

21:01.520 --> 21:04.489

21:04.530 --> 21:10.469

21:13.800 --> 21:16.667
MEN:
(speaking foreign language)

21:16.700 --> 21:19.999
(cell phone buzzes)
Let me see it.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.473
We're in position now.

21:21.510 --> 21:23.842
Rocco's still inside the bank.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.269
As soon as he leaves,
we're going in.

21:26.310 --> 21:28.278
GEORGE (over phone): Got our
guy at the port on lookout.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.947
He's gonna call me
when Rocco's guys

21:29.980 --> 21:31.743
bring the ladies
for transport.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.655
The second y'all get
your hands on the monies,

21:33.690 --> 21:36.750
me and my boys are gonna
snatch up some honeys.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.621
Did you get everything
from the safe house?

21:38.660 --> 21:40.594
GEORGE: Like y'all
were never there.

21:40.630 --> 21:43.292
Got the getaway boat
all loaded up.

21:43.330 --> 21:45.821
Got your money from
the safe house in there.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.428
And all of Chevw's
pots and pans.

21:47.470 --> 21:48.937
Thank you, George.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.666
As soon as we're out,
I'll let you know.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.804
Emptying your account's
gonna raise some flags.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.501
I'm gonna leave $1 million
in the account.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.441
A million for ten girls?

21:59.480 --> 22:02.119
They're worth it.

22:02.150 --> 22:05.347
(tense music)

22:05.390 --> 22:12.182
*

22:19.500 --> 22:21.434
Okay, let's go.

22:31.010 --> 22:35.071
*

22:37.850 --> 22:40.216
Miss Mendoza.
How may I help you?

22:40.250 --> 22:41.911
I would like to make
a withdrawal, please.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.326
Of course. How much are you
looking to withdraw today?

22:44.360 --> 22:46.225
$19 million.

22:46.260 --> 22:48.399
Is there a reason that you wish
to withdraw such a large--

22:48.430 --> 22:51.422
Just some business.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.097
Yes, of course.
Um...

22:53.130 --> 22:55.690
Unfortunately, your cash is
no longer at this location.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.538
-You'll need to wait 24--
-I'll take the hard drive.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.844
Yes.
If you'll give me a moment.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.973
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.040
What now?

23:11.090 --> 23:13.285
This is when we find out if
we have to rob a bank or not.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.288
We're not robbing a bank.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.912
POTE: Hmm.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.155
(cell phone buzzes)

23:20.960 --> 23:22.427
What is it?

23:22.460 --> 23:26.066
Sir, Teresa Mendoza
is looking to withdraw

23:26.100 --> 23:28.261
almost the entire sum of
her account onto a hard drive.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.962
*

23:31.010 --> 23:34.434
How much is she leaving
in her account?

23:34.480 --> 23:36.436
$1 million.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.107
ROCCO (over phone):
Ah, she's testing us.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.209
Such brazen theatrics.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.447
I'll have to remember
to cure her of that.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.378
Give her the hard drive.

23:45.420 --> 23:50.619
*

23:50.660 --> 23:53.424
Miss Mendoza, if you'll please
accompany me to the vault.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.997
-Sure.
-Alone.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.391
(cell phone buzzes)

24:02.440 --> 24:04.237
I'm sorry.
I need to get this.

24:04.270 --> 24:06.568
Just one minute.
Yeah?

24:06.610 --> 24:08.601
GEORGE: Bad news, principessa.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.677
They're moving the girls early.
As in right now.

24:11.710 --> 24:13.940
I don't have what
we came for yet.

24:13.980 --> 24:16.073
Shit, man. Maybe we need
to hit the ejector button

24:16.120 --> 24:17.644
on this one, T.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.817
There ain't no shortage
of girls in other places

24:19.850 --> 24:21.010
that need saving.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.652
*

24:22.690 --> 24:24.851
Don't do it.

24:24.890 --> 24:26.619
GEORGE (over phone):
It's now or never.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.958
But I gotta seriously advise
against being stuck inside

24:29.000 --> 24:31.298
a sealable building when
this shit goes down.

24:31.330 --> 24:34.163
*

24:34.200 --> 24:35.861
Get the girls.

24:41.140 --> 24:42.539
Gracias, maestra.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.117
Why would you do that,

24:49.150 --> 24:51.539
push me towards a man
you don't trust?

24:51.590 --> 24:53.285
You said we need him.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.118
If keeping Cortez close
helps our family,

24:56.160 --> 24:58.526
the closer the better.

24:58.560 --> 25:03.122
Dangerous men, Isabela,
are not to be toyed with.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.866
You need to learn discretion.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.698
So teach me.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.129
The heroin is selling
like a Christmas miracle.

25:10.170 --> 25:12.138
I'd like to keep
our arrangement.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.570
And Camila?
And the Colombians?

25:14.610 --> 25:18.000
Ah, what do they say?
"Ignorance is bliss."

25:18.050 --> 25:20.371
I won't tell if you don't.

25:20.410 --> 25:22.241
(chuckles)

25:22.280 --> 25:24.384
CAMILA: You two look
like old pals.

25:24.420 --> 25:26.308
No one would think that one

25:26.350 --> 25:27.749
tried to burn
the other one alive.

25:27.790 --> 25:30.384
(chuckles)
Bygones, seora.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.921
Men don't hold grudges.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.155
(speaks Spanish)

25:34.200 --> 25:36.760
Some men have thicker skin
than others.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.722
To what do we owe the pleasure?

25:38.770 --> 25:40.897
BOAZ: I'm here to take Kique
with me on a business meeting.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.862
Our favorite Colombians
are In town,

25:42.900 --> 25:45.164
but I guess you
already knew that.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.166
Excuse me, governor.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.303
BOAZ: Kique...

25:50.240 --> 25:52.242
-Te amo.
-Love you.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.111
Bye, Kique.

25:57.150 --> 26:00.085
They're meeting
with the Colombians?

26:00.120 --> 26:01.883
When did that get arranged?

26:01.920 --> 26:05.481
I was just asking myself
the same question.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.427
I'm sorry, Miss Mendoza,

26:08.460 --> 26:10.257
we don't allow weapons
inside the vault.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.359
If you don't mind.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.731
Sure.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.603
Follow me.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.674
Please enter
your SIgnature here.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.048
(keyboard clacking)

26:31.090 --> 26:32.614
You have the whole thing
memorized.

26:32.650 --> 26:34.811
WOMAN: I'm quite impressed.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.784
It's only amateurs
that need to write it down.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.522
There. The funds are
uploading to the hard drive.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.737
You should know my intentions
with Teresa are good.

26:51.770 --> 26:54.409
(scoffs)
You proposing?

26:54.440 --> 26:56.101
I'm not her father.

26:57.510 --> 26:59.842
I get it.
If things were reversed--

26:59.880 --> 27:02.576
-They wouldn't be.
-All right, cut the bullshit.

27:02.620 --> 27:06.147
I never betrayed you or Teresa.
I was loyal to Camila.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.681
Doesn't even matter if you
think I should be here or not.

27:08.720 --> 27:12.588
Teresa trusts me, and
that should be enough for you.

27:12.630 --> 27:16.726
My brother kept a weasel
as a pet when we were nios.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.531
Found it as a baby.
Gave it the bottle.

27:21.570 --> 27:24.368
Slept with it like it
was a stuffed animal.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.934
My parents trusted
the weasel

27:25.970 --> 27:28.632
with my brother
like it was a dog.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.047
One night, while my brother
was sleeping,

27:32.080 --> 27:36.642
the we_asel clawed out_
one of ms eyes and ate It.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.511
Sad ending.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.924
Especially for the weasel.

27:47.330 --> 27:48.649
Good talk.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.694
(speaks in foreign language)

27:55.740 --> 27:58.709
(tense music)

27:58.740 --> 28:05.043
*

28:05.080 --> 28:07.548
(whispering chatter)

28:07.580 --> 28:09.172
All right, on the count of
three, we're gonna give 'em

28:09.220 --> 28:12.041
the ol' Royal Texas bum rush.
You ready, boys?

28:12.090 --> 28:13.648
-Yes, my King.
-Yeah.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.157
GEORGE: All right,
now remember,

28:15.190 --> 28:17.750
a pirate's only as good
as his shanghai.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.428
(chuckles)

28:19.460 --> 28:21.155
One, two, three, go, bitches.

28:21.200 --> 28:25.193
(grunting)

28:30.370 --> 28:31.598
Shit.

28:32.710 --> 28:35.702
(opera music playing)

28:35.740 --> 28:39.005
*

28:39.050 --> 28:42.542
Mm.

28:42.580 --> 28:45.378
(shushing)

28:45.420 --> 28:47.888

28:47.920 --> 28:52.050

28:54.100 --> 28:56.250
(whimpers)

28:56.300 --> 28:59.360
*

28:59.400 --> 29:00.662
What?

29:02.170 --> 29:04.058
Attacked by who at the docks?

29:04.110 --> 29:07.068
Why would African
guerrilla fighters...

29:07.110 --> 29:08.532
*

29:08.580 --> 29:09.979
(sighs)

29:11.650 --> 29:14.312
We need to get back
to the bank now.

29:14.350 --> 29:16.147
Come on, girls.

29:18.020 --> 29:20.238
(ominous music)

29:20.290 --> 29:22.087

29:22.120 --> 29:23.758
-(phones ringing, dinging)
MAN: I'll call you right back.

29:23.790 --> 29:26.384
WOMAN: One moment, sir.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.990
(tense music)

29:29.030 --> 29:31.794
WOMAN: I'm sorry, ma'am...
MAN: We'll call you right back.

29:31.830 --> 29:34.663
*

29:34.700 --> 29:36.793
(doors buzz shut)

29:36.840 --> 29:38.330
I knew we were
gonna rob a bank.

29:38.370 --> 29:40.429
(yelling in foreign language)

29:40.470 --> 29:43.735

29:43.780 --> 29:45.509
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

(alarm blaring)

29:46.850 --> 29:49.011
-What was that?
-I'm not sure.

29:49.050 --> 29:52.486
(door whirs shut)

29:52.520 --> 29:57.150

30:02.330 --> 30:05.163
-What're you doing?
-Give me the hard drive.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.839
I have no idea
what's gomg on out there.

30:07.870 --> 30:09.337
Then why do you
look so nervous?

30:09.370 --> 30:11.167
Why would I steal my own money?

30:11.210 --> 30:12.632
WOMAN: I'll let Mr. De la Pea

30:12.670 --> 30:14.672
ask you that question
when he returns.

30:14.710 --> 30:18.146
Now give me the hard drive.

30:18.180 --> 30:19.807
No.

30:19.850 --> 30:22.478
Ah!

30:22.520 --> 30:24.317

Ah!

We need to get her out!

Ah.

30:47.340 --> 30:50.832
Ah, chinga tu madre, cabrn!

What the hell are you doing?

31:48.600 --> 31:49.931
JAMES:
There's too many of them.

31:49.970 --> 31:51.039
We need to turn on
the vacuum seal.

31:51.070 --> 31:52.537
POTE: Not yet.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.299
We gotta get her
out of the vault first.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.638
JAMES: If she walks out into
these guards, she's dead.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.148
(cooling system hisses)

31:59.180 --> 32:00.704
(alarm beeping)

32:00.750 --> 32:02.479
How is she supposed to breathe?

32:02.520 --> 32:05.978
JAMES: Rocco said the rooms
are individually sealed.

32:06.020 --> 32:09.558

Cabrn.

No one puts Bilal
in the corner.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.112
Thank you, my King.
I had him.

32:36.150 --> 32:37.469
I know you did.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.249
I just got a little greedy
is all.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.609
Didn't want you to outshine me
in front of the girls.

32:40.650 --> 32:41.912
You know what I'm saying?

32:41.960 --> 32:45.452
(doors creaking open)

32:46.630 --> 32:49.121
Ladies.
I know what you're thinking.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.129
Out of the frying pan
and into the fire, right?

32:52.170 --> 32:55.799
Well, this is what a Teresa
Mendoza rescue looks like.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.933
-(distant sirens wailing)
-No time to get picky.

32:57.970 --> 33:01.770
Teresa sent you?
Where is she?

33:01.810 --> 33:04.404
She's a little preoccupied
at the moment.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.541
Don't come here.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.515
I got the girls but our
getaway ship just got seized.

34:18.550 --> 34:20.211
What now, principessa?

34:20.250 --> 34:22.480
*

34:27.730 --> 34:29.254
The police got our ship.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.224
We need to find another way
out of Malta.

34:32.270 --> 34:33.965
POTE: Rocco controls
the local police.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.434
There's an airfield
about 9 kilometers away.

34:36.470 --> 34:38.358
I scouted it as a backup.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.560
George, I'm gonna send you the
address to an airfield, okay?

34:40.610 --> 34:41.975
TERESA (over phone):
Bring the girls there.

34:42.010 --> 34:44.274
You got a bird in the nest?

34:44.310 --> 34:46.870
Not yet.

Bitch.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.552
Yes?

LOYA (over phone): King
George's ship has been seized

35:04.970 --> 35:06.597
at a port in Malta.

35:06.630 --> 35:08.234
The DEA tracked his ship
using the hull ID number

35:08.270 --> 35:09.965
from the page you gave me.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.161
And Teresa?

35:12.210 --> 35:13.563
Malta police confiscated

35:13.610 --> 35:15.271
$7 million in cash,
but no Teresa.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.075

I'll give you $200,000
to get us in the air

37:03.420 --> 37:05.388

ROCCO (over phone):
And now you're all alone,
