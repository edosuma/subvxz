WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.680
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:04.104 --> 00:05.048
Hey, where y'all going?

00:05.138 --> 00:06.208
We're gonna make some money.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.280
Look after Chelsea while I'm gone.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.956
You know what kind of deep shit you'd be in

00:11.011 --> 00:12.649
if you did... This?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.151
And this.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.215
Oh, my God.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.352
Reason we don't get jacked with in here is

00:17.451 --> 00:19.658
we're the ones bringing in the drugs.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.726
That's why they leave us alone.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.495
You really can get the dope?

00:23.790 --> 00:25.326
I might have a way to get it in.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.234
- We had a deal.
- The deal's still good.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.397
Just one more condition.

00:28.495 --> 00:31.533
You want your shit, you got to kill Judith.

00:31.632 --> 00:35.409
That heroin is still a thousand miles away
from being in my possession.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.511
It would be a terrible shame

00:37.571 --> 00:42.316
if my brother Danny accidentally
made a wrong turn with one of them trucks.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.388
I didn't know Hot Rod
was a legitimate businessman.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.583
He ain't.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.216
It's just a way to move the dope.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.421
But the dope in the tow car
gives him deniability.

00:51.518 --> 00:52.929
It's an old trick, but it still works.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.400
DEA, show me your hands.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.993
I see you got your gun out.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.688
Damn it, Chelsea. Hurry up and take a shit.
I ain't got all night.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.597
Hey, don't you dare.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.226
No, Chelsea!

01:29.690 --> 01:31.294
No, Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!

01:33.093 --> 01:34.697
Chelsea!

01:35.896 --> 01:37.569
Chelsea! Chelsea!

01:38.532 --> 01:39.943
Chelsea!

01:42.469 --> 01:45.643
I'm gonna be down today,
so y'all need to be ready.

01:46.239 --> 01:49.584
The grand design is
coming together for real, Mina.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.449
Shit!

01:52.579 --> 01:55.458
See, I was just hiding my time,

01:55.549 --> 01:58.496
waiting for the opportunity to strike.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.223
Like a Predator drone.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.293
That whole stretch in Mexico,

02:05.392 --> 02:08.168
forsaken in the desert like I was,

02:08.261 --> 02:10.764
I knew that that was my only shot.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.405
Holy shit.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.596
Hey!

02:43.597 --> 02:45.474
No, I'm all right.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.138
In fact, I'm better than all right.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.676
I got business taken care of.

02:52.439 --> 02:55.318
It's gonna be golden times for Dewey Crowe.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.780
What you mean he's gone?

02:59.846 --> 03:00.950
I mean he took the Chevette.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.119
I been calling, I been texting.
He's not answering me.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.356
Well, go after him. He can't be far.
He ain't got no money.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.487
That's right, thanks to you.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.123
Well, what is it
you want me to do about this, Wendy?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.031
I want you to help me find Kendal!

03:10.123 --> 03:11.534
Why are you acting like this ain't a big thing?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.901
Because I have other damn shit
to deal with, Wendy!

03:13.994 --> 03:14.995
Such as?

03:15.062 --> 03:16.166
Such as Danny ain't back yet,

03:16.229 --> 03:18.539
and he has a big-ass shipment
of something I need.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.470
God damn, man.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.740
Where the hell you been?

03:22.135 --> 03:23.341
- Darryl.
- What?

03:23.970 --> 03:25.040
We...

03:26.807 --> 03:28.753
We got a serious situation.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.880
Yeah.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.490
This truck mean something to you?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.718
Little roadside set-to last night,

03:37.818 --> 03:40.389
put a DEA agent in the hospital
with a broken pelvis

03:40.487 --> 03:42.990
on account of getting clipped by a tow truck.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.065
Well, the DEA's BOLO came through

03:46.159 --> 03:49.265
about the same time
I got flagged down by a couple of campers.

03:49.362 --> 03:52.172
Said they saw some fool out here
trying to unhitch a car.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.704
Said he didn't look right.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.509
He had it up on a hill to do it.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.580
And there's a big divot
in the ground over here where the car hit.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.022
Doesn't look like you're dealing with
any kind of Einstein here.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.523
No, I suppose not.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.420
Whatcha thinking?

04:09.182 --> 04:11.423
Just trying to imagine
what my Einstein's gonna do

04:11.518 --> 04:13.225
with a carload of Mexican brown.

04:25.632 --> 04:26.633
Ava Crowder?

04:28.401 --> 04:29.607
Got a visitor.

04:42.883 --> 04:46.626
<i>I think I finally got a line on
the fella that put you in this mess.</i>

04:46.720 --> 04:49.064
Now, he ain't been easy 10 find,

04:49.222 --> 04:51.168
but I think I finally got that possum treed.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.400
Now, listen to me.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.296
Once he recants...

04:55.395 --> 04:57.238
And he's gonna recant.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.806
All this will be over.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.942
All this time,

05:04.004 --> 05:06.644
waiting on you to come up with a plan
to cut me loose,

05:07.674 --> 05:09.984
thinking somehow
you'd be able to pull it off...

05:10.076 --> 05:11.248
Well, and that's what I'm doing, baby.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.154
- That's what I'm in the process of doing.
- Let me finish.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.660
I realise now it ain't hardly right to ask.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.826
You done everything you could do

05:19.920 --> 05:21.092
to bring about an end to this,

05:21.254 --> 05:23.530
but there ain't no end to bring about.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.495
And the longer I keep wishing there was,

05:26.593 --> 05:29.096
the more intolerable my situation.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.437
What are you saying, Ava?

05:35.335 --> 05:39.340
There's things I got to do in here
in order to survive.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.113
And the less you got
to do with them, the better.

05:44.711 --> 05:47.715
Boyd, I'm saying goodbye.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.723
- I don't want you coming back.
- Ava. Ava.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.157
Woman.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.467
Do you know what I've done for you?

05:57.457 --> 06:00.563
Do you have any idea

06:00.660 --> 06:03.140
what I have had to do for you?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.539
I do.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.004
There's not a day goes by
I don't think about it.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.375
Well, I don't think you do,

06:08.468 --> 06:10.539
or else you wouldn't be
having this conversation...

06:10.637 --> 06:11.672
- Boyd.
- ...with me...

06:11.738 --> 06:13.308
- Boyd.
- ...right now.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.846
I love you.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.413
I always will, okay?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.717
Ava. Ava. Look at me.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.151
- Ava.
- Guard?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.522
Look at me.

06:22.582 --> 06:23.652
Ava.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.058
Ava, look at me.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.157
Ava.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.323
Ava!

07:06.860 --> 07:08.203
All right.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.106
I'll see you in a little bit.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.479
I'm gonna need you
to take a ride with me, Jimmy.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.751
And what is it we aiming to do

07:24.811 --> 07:28.122
when we get wherever it is
you plan on taking us?

07:28.415 --> 07:29.416
Listen, son.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.921
I know recent times
this has been a hard road.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.125
But you didn't sign up with me

07:35.221 --> 07:37.098
'cause you thought it was gonna be easy.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.626
Hey, yo, Boyd!

07:39.726 --> 07:41.171
We're in the back.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.433
Hey, yo!

07:43.296 --> 07:47.142
Please tell me you have some good news.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.645
Look, man,
I came to tell you face-to-face, man.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.976
Look, we got a situation.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.482
- A situation?
- Yeah.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.849
I don't want to hear about another one
of your goddamn situations.

07:59.746 --> 08:00.747
Yeah.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.450
Dewey Crowe,

08:04.284 --> 08:05.957
you just about qualify

08:06.019 --> 08:08.522
as the most sought-after man
in Harlan County.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.430
Where in the hell are you, son?

08:10.957 --> 08:12.937
I'll tell you where I'm at, Boyd.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.973
I'm sitting high on that fabled catbird seat.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.303
How you like that?

08:17.430 --> 08:20.968
I don't care where you sit,
as long as it's close to my dining-room table

08:21.034 --> 08:22.604
'cause I'm getting awful hungry.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.946
Listen up, Boyd. I got your shit.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.677
<i>I got it all.</i>

08:28.541 --> 08:31.147
Well, I... I mean, I got half of it.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.619
But it's the whole half.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.283
<i>Anyways, right now it's mine.</i>

08:36.383 --> 08:40.695
I could light out
to Canada or Wyoming or some shit,

08:40.787 --> 08:42.630
and you'd never see it again.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.700
Well, you could, but I wouldn't advise it.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.965
And what's your co-pilot
have to say about that?

08:50.997 --> 08:51.998
Danny?

08:52.132 --> 08:55.079
No, I ditched his ass outside Parkersvilie.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.580
Parkersvilie? Parkersvilie?

08:57.670 --> 09:00.173
Look, this conversation is just you and me.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.380
Hold on, Dewey.
I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.580
Go ahead.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.523
<i>This is how it's gonna be.</i>

09:06.980 --> 09:10.894
<i>You all are gonna bring me $250,000 in cash,</i>

09:11.317 --> 09:13.661
<i>which is what I'm owed for the whorehouse.</i>

09:14.020 --> 09:15.328
<i>Darryl can have Audry's.</i>

09:15.388 --> 09:18.767
I don't care. I just want my money
and get the hell out of here.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.605
Well, I guess I only have two questions...

09:21.694 --> 09:23.173
Where and when?

09:23.496 --> 09:26.102
When is today, before dark.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.577
<i>I want to get out of here by sunset.</i>

09:28.668 --> 09:31.342
Well, that's an awful lot of money
on such short notice.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.584
Well, I know it's a lot of money,
but guess what...

09:33.673 --> 09:34.743
I don't give a shit.

09:34.841 --> 09:35.876
<i>Find a way.</i>

09:35.942 --> 09:36.943
<i>And where.</i>

09:37.043 --> 09:38.613
<i>Well, I'm gonna tell you
when you call me back</i>

09:38.711 --> 09:40.349
<i>saying you got my money.</i>

09:43.016 --> 09:45.462
Not so funny now, am I, Boyd?

09:45.852 --> 09:47.525
You hear me laughing, son?

09:48.521 --> 09:52.264
Well, I'll be waiting on your call.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.199
Thank you.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.868
He done went rogue, man.
That's what I came to tell you, man.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.909
Hey, don't be looking at me like that, man.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.144
I told you we got a problem.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.480
You know what?

10:09.709 --> 10:11.746
That's where you're wrong, Darryl.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.782
We ain't got a problem.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.449
Based on this phone call,

10:17.317 --> 10:18.728
you got a problem.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.393
Let's get out of here.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.807
Well, I guess we'll just have lo wait then,
won't we?

10:36.736 --> 10:38.306
So let me guess.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.619
He says it'll be a few more hours.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.958
So with this phone call,
wherein we just learned

10:48.014 --> 10:50.494
that Boyd Crowder
has lost half our shipment,

10:51.084 --> 10:53.963
he seems like less of a partner
and more like a problem.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.591
Could be argued that
it's the Florida crew that's the problem.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.602
And who brought in the Florida crew?

11:00.593 --> 11:01.594
Yeah.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.302
The fact is, he's a liability,

11:04.998 --> 11:06.306
whatever his local attributes.

11:06.366 --> 11:10.280
Those local attributes are, at present,
our entire business model.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.947
Even so, we still have Yoon
and his crew to factor in.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.318
All the more reason
for additional boots on the ground.

11:19.012 --> 11:23.461
You know, Duffy, I really do not understand
this fascination you hold for Boyd Crowder.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.528
What is it? His hair?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.326
Because at some point
in the not-so-distant future,

11:30.390 --> 11:32.631
you have to ask yourself a question.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.003
Who am I gonna work with?

11:35.061 --> 11:38.702
Him, who most certainly's
gonna get you killed...

11:38.798 --> 11:41.677
Or me, who most certainly
is gonna get you rich.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.650
Man, this looks pretty damn good, huh?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.744
Yeah, real good.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.220
It's all our profits from the whorehouse

11:52.312 --> 11:55.054
plus a couple extra hundred
from individual whores.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.651
Hey, just don't let cousin Dewey
get a chance to count it.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.189
I'll make sure of that.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.089
I'm trusting you on that, brother.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.167
- Hey, you heard from Kendal yet?
- No.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.203
I keep trying him,
and he's not getting back to me.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.536
That little pecker
better get his ass up here soon

12:09.162 --> 12:10.698
'cause he was last one
to have eyes on Chelsea,

12:10.763 --> 12:11.935
and I can't find her anywhere.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.339
Cool out, man.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.073
All right?
You need to make yourself scarce, anyway.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.409
I don't want that Crowder shithead

12:17.503 --> 12:19.949
coming up in here
seeing you getting all spun up

12:20.039 --> 12:21.518
talking greasy' so go on.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.712
All right. I got to take a shit.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.017
All right.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.114
You texting him?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.419
I don't know what else to do.

12:28.514 --> 12:29.618
Do you have a better idea?

12:29.716 --> 12:32.390
Don't believe
I've ever seen it so dead in here.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.625
Looks like you
got some kind of reverse incentive

12:34.721 --> 12:35.756
keeping folks away.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.368
Well, can't every day be Black Friday.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.062
Bound to have ebbs and flows.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.571
Today, we had an ebb.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.438
And to think, people say
the business model's idiot-proof.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.101
Speaking of which, where's Dewey?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.368
He ain't here.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.203
That's a handsome attaché.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.038
What is that? Alligator?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.607
This right here is pleather.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.276
Had me fooled. What's in it?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.048
My used condoms.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.987
You know,
we got to wash them out for reuse.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.489
This here's a green whorehouse.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.560
Yeah? Let's crack it open,
make sure they're in compliance.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.153
No, no, no. As my sister here will tell you,

13:06.252 --> 13:07.925
if you want to see what's inside,

13:07.987 --> 13:10.297
you're gonna have to go on out
and get yourself a warrant.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.425
Ain't that right, sister?

13:16.763 --> 13:17.798
It's a ringer.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.005
Look at that.

13:20.566 --> 13:21.909
Between that and the pleather,

13:21.968 --> 13:24.812
someone's gonna be in
a world of disappointment getting this case.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.144
What the hell, man?

13:26.239 --> 13:29.311
What the hell is, today is
"not gonna tolerate any of your bullshit" day.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.513
- You want to test me?
- No.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.987
Hey, there ain't no cause for that, Marshal.

13:32.078 --> 13:35.025
Now, you're just putting a couple of
innocents in jeopardy, acting out like this.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.593
I swear, I can't recall the last innocent

13:36.649 --> 13:39.152
I came across
with a briefcase full of fake cash.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.630
All right, let's say
you were gonna arrest us right now.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.294
So that we might enjoy
our rights as citizens of a democracy,

13:44.357 --> 13:46.166
under what charges would you detain us?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.499
Possession of newsprint?

13:47.593 --> 13:48.765
I ain't arresting you.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.338
I'm just confiscating what cash there is
into marshal's custody

13:52.432 --> 13:54.002
until you can prove whence it came.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.111
You want it,
it'll be at the Lexington courthouse.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.981
Probably cost you more in gas
than what's in there.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.947
Now, my earlier question...

14:03.710 --> 14:04.711
Where's Dewey?

14:04.811 --> 14:06.848
Man, ain't nobody seen him, man. Shit.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.688
Well, you won't mind if I look around,
in case someone here has.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.164
I don't want to see any cars leaving
while I'm here.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.220
You two get comfortable.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.030
Well, shit.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.632
But I'm partial to the pink.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.132
You remember me?

14:20.393 --> 14:24.136
Sure. Officer Buzz-kill. Ruined our pool day.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.342
We packing for a trip?

14:28.034 --> 14:31.015
We was just moving trailers.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.975
Any chance Dewey Crowds
gonna be in that new trailer?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.719
We ain't seen Dewey.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.348
Sweet.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.489
Y'all actually seem to care for the man.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.493
I get that, sort of a lost-puppy quality.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.161
He ain't done any harm.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.729
He's fair, and he don't raise his hands to us.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.191
Well, I'm telling you right now,

14:50.823 --> 14:53.565
I think he's in deeper waters
than he's prepared to swim.

14:53.659 --> 14:56.071
He can handle it, whatever it is.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.336
That's a lot of confidence for
a man who wears shorts with combat boots.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.878
Anyway, I recently
came into a shitload of money.

15:05.238 --> 15:09.015
Now, I'd be willing
to part with just a taste of it,

15:10.009 --> 15:11.352
but...

15:18.418 --> 15:19.624
Numbers on speed dial.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.204
What the hell?

15:31.697 --> 15:32.903
Hey, baby girls.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.740
Well, they're worried about you, Dewey.

15:34.801 --> 15:35.939
Is that Raylan?

15:36.035 --> 15:38.777
Got ideas you might be involved
with something well above your pay grade.

15:38.871 --> 15:39.941
It ain't us, Dewey.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.450
<i>This peckerwood stole my phone.</i>

15:41.541 --> 15:43.543
Not stole. Like rented.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.378
Fairly cheap, as it happens.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.755
- You think you're funny?
- I think I'm on the phone.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.761
I'm gonna ask you to back up
and keep your mouth shut until I'm off.

15:50.817 --> 15:54.321
And then we'll settle whatever grievances
you feel like you have suffered.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.658
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

15:58.291 --> 15:59.395
So you know, Dewey,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.302
<i>whatever you thought
the Crowes were gonna hand you</i>

16:01.394 --> 16:02.964
<i>to get their heroin back,</i>

16:03.329 --> 16:06.469
unless it was like $62.50,
you were about to get handed a ringer.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.341
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

16:08.434 --> 16:09.742
Just put Mina on.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.750
You name's mud as far as Boyd Crowder
and the Dixie Mafia's concerned.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.617
So I ask you, given these facts,

16:17.243 --> 16:20.452
who in all God's earthly pastures
is your only friend at this point?

16:22.081 --> 16:25.494
Damn, Raylan, you're right.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.524
I hadn't thought about that.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.368
My dream ain't gonna die so easy after all.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.433
Hello?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.474
I don't think
he took from that what I intended.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.412
I give up.

17:26.512 --> 17:27.819
What the hell are you doing?

17:29.415 --> 17:30.894
Had to get out of there.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.814
I like it that way.

18:29.742 --> 18:30.880
Yeah?

18:31.877 --> 18:33.220
Wasn't my choice.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.389
I know. Penny told me.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.226
She was in the yard when it happened.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.395
So you broke it off with him?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.162
Your man who was gonna save you.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.006
I did.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.570
Good for you, sister.

18:56.569 --> 19:01.678
All you can count on is the Holy Mother,
your sisters and yourself.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.589
And you know I got you.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.860
Hold this. I got to piss.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.642
Ava, dorm room hacks
are about to do a bed check.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.343
You in here, Judith?

19:30.436 --> 19:32.473
Go on. I'll be out.

19:32.538 --> 19:33.608
We got to go.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.613
Like now.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.214
All right.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.391
Here you go.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.728
I smell it.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.458
What?

19:52.958 --> 19:54.403
Pot. You got any more?

19:56.862 --> 19:57.966
You're 14.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.976
I was 12 the first time. Doesn't bother me.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.534
Well, it bothers me.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.345
How'd you get here?

20:04.403 --> 20:05.677
I've been driving since I was 11.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.647
First year I could reach the pedals.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.647
How'd you know where I live?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.155
They got this thing called Google.

20:13.646 --> 20:17.685
Kendal, you can't up and leave every time
you have a disagreement with your family.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.487
Danny's gonna have my ass.

20:19.985 --> 20:21.191
Why is that?

20:23.255 --> 20:25.326
I seen him do things when he ain't even mad,

20:25.391 --> 20:26.529
much less when he is.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.004
Things like what?

20:34.266 --> 20:36.405
If I was to ask you to come away with me,

20:36.502 --> 20:38.004
we could run off somewhere.

20:39.004 --> 20:41.109
I can do things, you know. I can bartend.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.215
Besides, you're not so happy
to be here yourself.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.054
Look, what you're talking about,
that's a fantasy.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.021
And nothing wrong with that,

20:53.786 --> 20:55.060
but I belong here.

20:55.354 --> 20:58.767
And where you belong
is back in Harlan with your kin.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.031
That's reality.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.361
Just forget it.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.906
- Hello?
- It's open. Come in.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.407
What the hell?

21:08.734 --> 21:09.906
I'm sorry, Kendal.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.972
That's where you disappeared to?

21:12.071 --> 21:13.982
Go blow a jay and drop a dime on me?

21:16.709 --> 21:18.211
Hey, big man.

21:18.811 --> 21:22.418
What happened?
You get lost on your way to the Save-A-Lot?

21:26.051 --> 21:27.223
Go on.

21:48.574 --> 21:52.818
Well, would you look
at this holy shit of a situation here.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.823
Dickie. What's with this?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.518
Hell on wheels.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.326
You know, they were
in there trying to tell me,

22:01.420 --> 22:04.799
"Hey, there's a Mr Parker Stevenson
here to see you,"

22:04.857 --> 22:06.097
and I'm like, "Hey, look at me."

22:06.158 --> 22:09.367
"Do I look like a guy who knows
a Parker-damn-Stevenson?"

22:09.595 --> 22:10.596
Nope.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.533
And lo and behold,
here you are, brother Parker.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.305
- Yeah.
- Hey, how you doing?

22:15.367 --> 22:18.439
Well, that's the...
That's the name on the ID, anyway.

22:19.471 --> 22:20.506
Damn, Dickie.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.108
Damn, Dewey.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.821
Wheels or no, you are a sight for sore eyes.

22:29.448 --> 22:34.329
Well, tell me, how can I help you?

22:36.655 --> 22:38.134
Wynn Duffy,

22:38.958 --> 22:41.199
call me up out of the blue

22:41.293 --> 22:43.000
10 years down the line.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.042
What did you think?
That I just couldn't stay away?

22:45.130 --> 22:46.837
When it comes to your motives, Katherine,

22:46.899 --> 22:49.505
I have long since abandoned speculating.

22:49.568 --> 22:52.708
How did you know I didn't come here
to put an ice pick in your neck?

22:53.005 --> 22:54.643
Worth it to see you again.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.375
And also,

22:57.643 --> 22:59.350
I could use some help.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.084
Damn straight you could.

23:02.648 --> 23:05.492
I keep up on current events.
I know your situation.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.487
You got yourself caught between

23:08.554 --> 23:12.001
a Detroit rock and shitkicker hard place,

23:12.391 --> 23:15.497
trafficking in weight
like you said you never would.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.565
What happened, Wynn?

23:17.663 --> 23:19.836
Did you finally just get greedy?

23:20.666 --> 23:22.339
I don't know what happened.

23:23.869 --> 23:27.339
That's why I called.
You always had a way of cultivating clarity.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.746
So what do you need?

23:29.041 --> 23:30.543
An assessment.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.951
The rock or the shitkicker.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.046
And...

23:35.447 --> 23:37.688
Let's say for the sake of discussion,

23:38.717 --> 23:39.923
I've missed you.

23:42.521 --> 23:45.730
I would need to meet them both,
preferably at the same time.

23:46.725 --> 23:50.036
Be nice to do this
where the guns aren't likely to come out.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.096
Done.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.267
- And, Wynn...
- Yes?

23:53.766 --> 23:56.872
- ...if I come in on this assessment...
- Yes.

23:57.803 --> 24:00.784
...it'll be 50k in advance.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.713
As I said, I've missed you, Katherine.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.122
No. I don't know.

24:11.216 --> 24:12.923
Okay, go ahead. Come on.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.065
Ones on Sherman Pass
and Conner are up, too.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.576
Can put another on Old Eyman Trail,

24:27.666 --> 24:29.976
but DEA's pulling
a lot of resources for their dragnet.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.447
Cell pinged the triangle
between Black Mountain and Putney.

24:32.571 --> 24:34.312
Only way he's getting out is over us,

24:34.406 --> 24:36.511
and I don't see Dewey owning a jet pack.

24:36.608 --> 24:38.519
Unless he's holed up somewhere
waiting us out.

24:44.917 --> 24:45.861
Givens.

24:45.951 --> 24:47.760
<i>You have a collect call from...</i>

24:47.820 --> 24:49.822
<i>Raylan Givens, don't hang up!
It's Dickie Bennett!</i>

24:49.922 --> 24:52.664
<i>...an inmate
at the Tremble Federal Penitentiary.</i>

24:52.758 --> 24:54.499
<i>Will you accept the changes?</i>

24:58.864 --> 25:04.371
What became of us, Raylan?

25:06.638 --> 25:08.640
Seems like
we each ended up where we belong.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.345
How did it ever come to...

25:12.644 --> 25:15.557
To this?
I mean, another lifetime, you and me, we...

25:15.647 --> 25:18.560
We could have been
thick as thieves, you know?

25:18.650 --> 25:20.391
Well, in this one,

25:20.486 --> 25:23.399
you strung me upside down
and treated me like a piñata,

25:23.489 --> 25:25.969
and then came after a 14-year-old girl.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.972
I have had time, and...

25:30.129 --> 25:32.166
Time and more damn time in here

25:32.231 --> 25:34.871
to mull over my mistakes,

25:34.967 --> 25:38.380
and I'll have you know
lam coming 'round to admitting

25:39.304 --> 25:41.375
I probably made my share along the way.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.248
Good. Good for you.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.881
Self-improvement is a wonderful thing.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.988
Now, you called me
claiming to know where Dewey Crowe is.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.384
What... Hey...

25:51.483 --> 25:54.987
Why don't you just slow down, there,
Mr insensitivity?

25:55.054 --> 25:58.592
Can you not see I'm about to betray
my one true friend in the world, here?

25:58.690 --> 26:01.170
How about this?
How about you start, Raylan?

26:01.994 --> 26:04.270
How about just telling me
what's coming to me?

26:04.997 --> 26:08.069
How about Jack and shit?

26:08.167 --> 26:09.407
Raylan, Raylan.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.879
You know, I can see
the penny still hasn't quite dropped.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.211
You always were a little slow,

26:13.272 --> 26:15.752
so I'm gonna tell you one more time.

26:15.841 --> 26:18.117
I am in possession of the wherewithal

26:18.210 --> 26:21.589
to tell you right where Dewey Crowe
is gonna be in the next 45 minutes,

26:21.680 --> 26:23.387
so I'd advise you to just rethink

26:23.449 --> 26:26.453
this whole smartass strategy you got here

26:26.852 --> 26:30.095
if you want this present
wrapped up under your tree.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.395
What is it you'd like, Dickie?

26:31.457 --> 26:35.098
I would like
transfer to long-term hospital care.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.196
Someplace way out of state, Raylan.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.572
Way away from all these bad memories.

26:40.365 --> 26:41.810
Please, Raylan.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.082
And would you like that transfer
by helicopter

26:45.137 --> 26:46.411
or are you okay with just a van?

26:50.375 --> 26:51.911
Yeah. Laugh it up, Raylan.

26:52.211 --> 26:55.886
But from what Dewey told me,
this is a target worth hitting, Raylan,

26:56.148 --> 26:57.821
so, you know, I'm gonna need you

26:57.916 --> 27:00.897
to hook me up
with some serious rehabilitation, Raylan,

27:00.953 --> 27:03.559
for this lame-ass leg that you, Raylan,

27:03.622 --> 27:06.569
you played no small part in afflicting, Raylan.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.127
- Dickie.
- This right here.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.900
You ain't getting
any transfer to a country club.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.474
And your legs are the way they are

27:13.565 --> 27:15.977
'cause you're an asshole
who don't know when to quit.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.843
- Just hold up, Raylan.
- But,

27:18.971 --> 27:21.781
if you tell me what you have
and it leads to an arrest,

27:21.840 --> 27:23.945
maybe we can talk about

27:24.009 --> 27:26.990
greater protections and freedoms
within your stay here.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.251
Yeah.

27:30.282 --> 27:34.094
All right, Raylan. All right. You win.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.266
You want to find Dewey, here's what you do.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.769
First of all, go to the Gas 'N Go or whatever

27:39.825 --> 27:41.361
and get yourself a map of Kentucky.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.267
Follow Route 9 southbound with your finger.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.367
Follow it way, way down
until you're pointing right at...

27:48.534 --> 27:49.774
Your asshole.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.178
And then what you're gonna do is

27:51.270 --> 27:52.772
you're gonna take your hand, and just...

27:52.838 --> 27:54.681
Just go ahead and cram it right up inside.

27:54.773 --> 27:57.185
You got to make sure, Raylan,
that you do it in a way

27:57.276 --> 28:00.621
so that the rest of you just keeps on
following your hand right up your ass,

28:00.679 --> 28:03.523
right up inside
all that shit you're so full of, Raylan.

28:03.615 --> 28:06.459
And then what you're gonna do,
is you're just gonna...

28:08.387 --> 28:10.958
Wink out of existence forever.

28:11.456 --> 28:13.129
Proud of that one, aren't you?

28:16.562 --> 28:17.802
It'll do.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.832
Like you say.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.908
So Dewey came to you

28:24.369 --> 28:27.043
looking for a home for his purloined heroin.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.211
I'm just gonna assume you sent him
to one of your old Bennett dealers.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.552
But I don't have to find him there, do I?

28:33.412 --> 28:35.221
I think Boyd and Darryl
would've put the word out,

28:35.314 --> 28:37.590
so the first thing that dude's gonna do
is call one of them.

28:38.083 --> 28:42.395
So all I got to do is go back and
wait for them to come home with it.

28:44.590 --> 28:48.003
So all that's left for me to do here

28:49.161 --> 28:51.505
is say thank you for your help,

28:52.497 --> 28:54.499
unwitting as it may have been.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.874
Good to see you, Dickie. Especially in here.

28:57.936 --> 28:59.574
Can you hear this, Raylan,

28:59.671 --> 29:02.379
or you need me to turn it up?

29:05.510 --> 29:07.046
Damn, son.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.623
How much you think all that's worth?

29:10.015 --> 29:11.756
This kind of weight?

29:12.517 --> 29:13.621
Damn.

29:14.686 --> 29:15.858
It's more than I got here.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.857
Dickie said you'd be good to go.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.264
Yeah, well, Dickie ain't been around
for a while.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.038
- Man!
- Deal like this...

29:22.094 --> 29:24.040
I got to call in the money cavalry.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.370
Well, call them in, man.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.137
I ain't got forever to do this thing.

29:27.699 --> 29:29.110
All right. Wait here.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.045
It's not true
that you should never drink alone.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.718
These are the happiest glasses
you'll ever drain.

29:42.981 --> 29:46.485
Well, I ain't drinking alone any more,
now, am I?

29:53.125 --> 29:54.798
Can I tell you a secret?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.005
I wish you would.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.479
I would love for a man
to just come up to me and say,

30:02.901 --> 30:06.144
"You are the prettiest woman here,"

30:06.238 --> 30:08.149
"and I just want to make love."

30:08.407 --> 30:10.182
Wait, no,

30:10.409 --> 30:13.652
"Bang you until the cops break us up."

30:16.481 --> 30:19.360
Well, let's just see how that sounds
coming from me.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.326
- Should we get out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.926
- Let's do it.
- Come on.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.003
Follow me.

30:38.770 --> 30:39.840
- Chelsea!
- Say it again, Cyrus.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.474
I didn't get the street name.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.350
Okay, got it.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.820
Yeah. Let's say 20 minutes. Good.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.683
Chelsea, come on, girl!

30:47.779 --> 30:49.053
Hey, cut that out, man.

30:49.147 --> 30:51.525
You're gonna freak her out
more than she already is.

30:51.616 --> 30:53.459
She's just never
spent a day on her own out there.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.826
Well, I'm sure she's fine.

30:54.886 --> 30:57.332
She's just shacked up
with some big' old black mastiff

30:57.389 --> 31:00.199
taking it real good like the bitch she is.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.965
Chelsea's not like that.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.664
Well, lighten up, baby brother.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.640
Look, we got eyes on cousin Dewey.

31:05.697 --> 31:09.167
Trying to pawn off our brown bricks
to one of Boyd's dealers.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.879
- Where the hell you been, man?
- Where's Chelsea?

31:12.971 --> 31:14.006
How the hell should I know?

31:14.072 --> 31:15.415
It's your goddamn job to know where she is.

31:15.507 --> 31:16.577
Well, I did my job.

31:16.675 --> 31:17.745
It's not my fault her dumb ass

31:17.843 --> 31:18.913
ain't got enough sense not to run off.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.148
Listen, if anything happened to her,

31:20.212 --> 31:21.213
I'm gonna take it out on your hide.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.553
- Hey, get away from him.
- Piece of shit.

31:22.647 --> 31:23.921
Chelsea's dead, asshole.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.395
She ran off last night

31:26.485 --> 31:27.759
chasing after some animal,

31:27.853 --> 31:29.264
got hit by a car up on Copper Road.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.156
And you...

31:32.557 --> 31:34.195
You left her up there all alone?

31:34.526 --> 31:35.937
Why do you think I ran?

31:36.027 --> 31:37.404
Didn't want you going all crazy and shit.

31:37.496 --> 31:38.668
I'm gonna kill you, you...

31:40.232 --> 31:42.234
lam gonna bury you in the back!

31:42.334 --> 31:44.746
I will kill you, you little Shit!

31:44.836 --> 31:46.509
Yeah? Just like you did Jean Baptiste?

31:52.344 --> 31:53.755
You said he was in Florida.

31:54.045 --> 31:58.221
Hell, he was talking a lot of shit,
so I shot him, okay?

31:58.884 --> 32:00.955
- I was gonna tell you.
- But you didn't, huh?

32:06.525 --> 32:09.028
You go to Dewey, get our brown bricks.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.398
When that's done,
get a wreath and some lilies,

32:11.463 --> 32:12.771
we'll give Chelsea a proper burial.

32:12.864 --> 32:15.310
You, go up there and get her body.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.902
Show a little goddamn respect.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.146
Then you're gonna
dig the hole to bury her in.

32:19.237 --> 32:20.409
You make sure he don't run off.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.042
We got enough goddamn problems.

32:22.407 --> 32:25.581
When that's all done,
we gonna have a big, old family conference.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.782
You hear me?

32:26.978 --> 32:28.150
Hey, you got to let me go up and see her.

32:28.246 --> 32:29.554
No, God damn it!

32:29.614 --> 32:30.718
I ain't gonna let this sit.

32:30.782 --> 32:31.988
- That little bastard!
- Danny! Listen to me!

32:32.083 --> 32:33.562
Get your mind right!

32:33.618 --> 32:35.962
We'll deal with Kendal later' You hear me?

32:36.822 --> 32:38.233
Yeah, I hear you.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.631
Hey, Danny, one more thing.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.906
That's for lying about JB. Now get up.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.607
What was with you in the bathroom earlier?

32:53.672 --> 32:55.811
I saw you standing there all spaced-out.

32:56.107 --> 32:58.018
I got a lot on my mind, is all.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.082
I saw the shiv.

33:01.413 --> 33:02.790
Don't worry, I ain't gonna tell.

33:03.348 --> 33:04.622
I want you to kill her.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.156
Sticker you got is good for slashing a throat,

33:10.255 --> 33:13.429
but that's if... If you get through the muscle.

33:14.092 --> 33:15.162
This is a stabber.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.934
Quicker, quieter, no muss, no fuss.

33:19.965 --> 33:21.672
Rowena put you up to this?

33:22.100 --> 33:23.841
Thinking I wouldn't go through with ii?

33:24.336 --> 33:26.213
Rowena wants you to do it for me.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.609
Why?

33:28.940 --> 33:30.783
Remember that guard, Milam?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.617
The one Judith forced me to lay with?

33:33.144 --> 33:34.987
Well, he wasn't the only one.

33:35.046 --> 33:37.390
Seeing as none of them
seen fit to slip on a rubber,

33:38.183 --> 33:39.958
all that action had consequences.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.955
And Judith forced me
to get rid of them consequences.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.499
You think you got protection from Judith,

33:45.557 --> 33:47.127
but you don't mean shit to her.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.136
You're just another playing piece.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.335
Judith's got an arrangement with the guards.

33:52.397 --> 33:53.967
She prays alone in the chapel.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.368
Chapel cameras are turned off at night.

33:56.902 --> 33:58.643
It's the best time.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.407
Hide this in there.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.869
You son of bitch.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.904
Put down the gun, Dewey.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.268
You got my money?

34:24.696 --> 34:26.175
You don't get any money, dickhead.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.245
All you got is me, and I'm pissed.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.574
Now, where is my shit?

34:30.869 --> 34:31.938
Kiss my ass.

34:32.036 --> 34:34.540
I still got a gun on you,
case you hadn't noticed.

34:35.273 --> 34:36.411
My goodness.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.510
All right, here's how it's gonna go.

34:39.043 --> 34:43.117
Little dipshit,
you toss the bag over to big dipshit.

34:43.348 --> 34:44.349
Big dipshit,

34:44.416 --> 34:46.418
you toss me three bricks for my trouble.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.762
And both of y'all,
put them goddamn guns away.

34:50.188 --> 34:53.465
Go on, Crazy 88, slide it over.

34:53.558 --> 34:55.264
- I thought we had a deal.
- You thought wrong.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.931
I don't know you,
and Dickie Bennett's a wormy little shitbird

34:58.029 --> 34:59.235
I never liked, anyway.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.801
Bricks.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.538
All right.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.375
And you can go.

35:10.575 --> 35:13.715
You know,
shoulda thought through this better, Dewey.

35:14.579 --> 35:16.650
Yeah, you ain't got the head for this.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.724
Why don't you come with me
and get what's coming?

35:19.784 --> 35:21.627
You realise what you just did to me, asshole?

35:21.920 --> 35:24.924
You run your raggedy little ass out that door,

35:25.056 --> 35:27.468
and I'll give you a two-minute jump
on your buddy here.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.266
I'm gonna tear your ass up, Dewey.

35:29.327 --> 35:31.466
Now, that's about
the best offer you're gonna get today,

35:31.563 --> 35:32.667
so I would take it.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.303
One, one thousand.

35:36.401 --> 35:38.074
Two, one thousand.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.148
Chelsea.

35:53.251 --> 35:54.423
Chelsea.

36:01.359 --> 36:03.270
I'm so sorry, Chelsea.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.265
Sorry for your loss.

36:10.468 --> 36:11.811
I'm having a private moment.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.781
Why don't you show some goddamn respect?

36:13.838 --> 36:15.317
No disrespect intended,

36:15.974 --> 36:17.851
despite the fact that dog
would have been happy

36:17.942 --> 36:20.684
to chew my face off
and wear it as a Halloween mask.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.624
I had this buddy
that ran a puppy mill in Sarasota,

36:26.184 --> 36:27.788
and he got popped for a DUI.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.030
He asked me to take care of his puppies.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.962
And I found this...

36:33.024 --> 36:34.833
This litter of dead puppies.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.631
I guess the mom had died

36:37.896 --> 36:40.809
when she was giving birth
and couldn't take care of the brood.

36:41.833 --> 36:45.406
But there was one puppy
who was barely alive, and it was Chelsea.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.480
And I...

36:48.640 --> 36:50.051
I raised her up.

36:52.977 --> 36:56.220
Considering the sombre occasion,
I'm inclined to do you a favour.

36:56.314 --> 36:59.352
How about you just go away
and let me grieve in peace?

36:59.651 --> 37:00.994
That I can't do.

37:01.486 --> 37:04.433
But, see, you carry that duffel

37:04.522 --> 37:05.830
any further up to Audry's,

37:06.324 --> 37:09.498
I'd be obliged to take Wendy and Kendal in
as accessories.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.608
And that would suck.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.370
What about Darryl?

37:14.432 --> 37:16.241
Him, I don't give a rat's ass,

37:16.334 --> 37:18.746
but I'd just as soon
eschew the collateral damage.

37:19.237 --> 37:23.447
Now, if you were to own up
to the contents of that duffel right here,

37:24.008 --> 37:27.512
well, then, you'd be the only Crowe
going away on this day of mourning.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.090
Do you see the favour?

37:32.550 --> 37:33.756
I do.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.461
And I appreciate it, sir.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.072
But I ain't done mourning yet.

37:43.728 --> 37:44.866
How old was she?

37:45.530 --> 37:46.531
Over six.

37:46.865 --> 37:47.866
Why?

37:48.433 --> 37:51.539
What is that?
About 40-something in dog years?

37:51.870 --> 37:53.213
And you're about 30.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.212
What's it matter?

37:55.273 --> 37:58.049
You slide your hand any closer to that gun,

37:58.243 --> 38:01.554
you're gonna meet Chelsea's fate
at a much younger age than she did.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.655
Say we go about it a different way.

38:03.748 --> 38:04.920
Different how?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.621
How far apart you reckon we are?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.459
20 feet, give or take.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.392
All right.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.130
That's about far enough.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.835
Far enough for what?

38:14.926 --> 38:16.837
You ain't never heard
of the 21 -foot rule before?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.168
Can't say I have.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.903
Me, I'm good to 50, 75 yards.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.437
Twenty one feet, that's like standing
plumb in front of the target.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.448
I guess the question is,

38:26.905 --> 38:28.179
how good a shot are you?

38:35.747 --> 38:38.193
Are you sure
you thought this through, Danny?

38:39.284 --> 38:41.423
- Let's just see.
- Well, first, let me explain...

39:02.440 --> 39:03.646
Shit, Danny.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.011
I would have said something.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.953
I swear to God, I didn't see it either.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.961
So you didn't shoot him.

39:20.959 --> 39:21.960
No.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.834
- Well, that's something.
- I was going to, though.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.835
Like an act of God, really.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.071
Raylan.

39:30.468 --> 39:31.640
There's one more thing.

39:32.136 --> 39:33.672
How's that even possible?

39:33.872 --> 39:36.478
We would have
rolled up Darryl Jr. with the fallout,

39:36.574 --> 39:39.521
Wendy, too,
but we had nothing to hold them on.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.022
Well, it's a good thing
you didn't waste every/body's time, then.

39:42.647 --> 39:45.491
Yeah, but they're pretty pissed.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.722
I would imagine so.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.659
I was dating this social worker,
Alison Brander.

39:50.321 --> 39:53.495
Kendal went to see her this afternoon.
And now...

39:53.825 --> 39:55.827
And now you think
they might be coming after her.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.442
All right. I'll take care of it.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.772
- Well, I can...
- No.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.543
You got your foot deep enough
in this shit heap already.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.743
- Alison Brander?
- Yeah, that's right.

40:09.674 --> 40:13.247
I mean, since you are apparently
my own personal, special problem

40:13.344 --> 40:16.291
that I must deal with, I'll handle it myself...

40:16.514 --> 40:17.754
If that's okay.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.291
You're the boss.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.711
Whoever you are, this is my time.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.404
Never figured you for praying alone.

40:42.473 --> 40:43.781
One hour a week

40:44.208 --> 40:47.553
I commune with the goddess
without any distractions.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.319
So you do believe?

40:49.881 --> 40:51.451
Does it matter?

40:51.916 --> 40:53.122
Really?

40:55.553 --> 40:57.430
I know why you're here.

40:58.056 --> 41:01.265
Always figured
Penny was the one to turn Judas.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.338
It ain't me.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.771
I don't want this.

41:04.829 --> 41:08.106
Washing your hands like Pontius Pilate.

41:08.433 --> 41:09.810
I know it's Rowena.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.445
She harbours ill will.

41:12.503 --> 41:15.677
Now you got a new drug source,
won't tell me who.

41:16.674 --> 41:21.248
Don't hardly take a fortune teller
to figure out what's coming.

41:21.779 --> 41:24.919
From what I hear, she's got reason.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.821
Every day I pray forgiveness
for what I had Penny do.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.100
I needed those drugs in here.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.300
Amazing,

41:36.361 --> 41:39.501
the unconscionable things
we'll do to survive, huh?

41:41.599 --> 41:43.203
Doesn't matter...

41:45.436 --> 41:47.780
'Cause I ain't gonna do it, anyway.

41:48.639 --> 41:50.209
What changed your mind, girl?

41:50.708 --> 41:53.314
See, I don't like
the game Rowena's playing at.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.454
Always one more hurdle to leap over.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.957
Changing the rules when she feels like it.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.464
I feel like there's
got to be a way we can work together.

42:02.954 --> 42:04.661
Something we can do.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.028
Now, you think that's possible?

42:07.125 --> 42:10.038
That sounds like a grand plan' darling.

42:12.463 --> 42:14.534
But how am I supposed to forget

42:14.632 --> 42:18.170
you coming at me in prayer
with a shiv in your hand?

42:41.259 --> 42:42.533
No! No!

42:42.593 --> 42:44.163
- Get off of me!
- No!

43:28.873 --> 43:30.045
Please.

43:32.076 --> 43:33.714
Whatever you're thinking of doing,

43:35.480 --> 43:37.050
you don't have to do it.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.060
What is it you suspect
I'm about to do, Albert?

43:43.621 --> 43:44.895
What do you want?

43:45.890 --> 43:47.062
You know,

43:48.092 --> 43:52.131
I spend most of my time
in the company of criminals.

43:52.497 --> 43:54.841
Now, one could argue
I'm guilty by association,

43:54.932 --> 43:56.138
but between me and you,

43:56.234 --> 43:58.942
I'm every bit as despicable as they are.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.175
Now, the thing about dealing dope

44:02.473 --> 44:07.786
is it offers people a moment of euphoria
in an otherwise bleak existence.

44:08.246 --> 44:09.850
You see, Albert,

44:09.947 --> 44:12.826
I'm really in the business of selling lies.

44:13.618 --> 44:15.461
What's that got to do with me?

44:15.753 --> 44:17.960
You're a person sworn to uphold the law.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.763
And all I'm asking you to do
is to tell the truth.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.629
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.772
I already know what you did, Albert.

44:26.597 --> 44:28.668
But me knowing
don't make a bit of difference.

44:28.766 --> 44:31.940
You got to understand that I got a condition.

44:32.436 --> 44:34.848
It's medical,
and I'm supposed to be on meds.

44:34.939 --> 44:36.714
Everybody has a condition, son.

44:37.108 --> 44:38.485
Ain't all of them can be medicated.

44:38.543 --> 44:39.715
Now, my condition

44:39.977 --> 44:44.119
is I got a woman
looking at doing a long stretch

44:44.549 --> 44:46.119
for something she didn't do.

44:46.784 --> 44:49.856
So I'm gonna need you
to un-ring the bell you struck

44:50.221 --> 44:52.724
injuring yourself
in the service of damning my woman.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.899
Please. I'm sorry.

44:56.294 --> 44:57.534
But I can't fix this.

44:57.962 --> 44:59.839
I can't. I can't do it.

45:08.406 --> 45:11.319
How many times did you stab yourself

45:12.977 --> 45:14.752
trying to make it look like my woman did it?

45:15.479 --> 45:16.890
I didn't mean to.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.358
How many times?

45:18.416 --> 45:19.588
Just two.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.492
It was two times.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.259
Two. Two times.

45:25.323 --> 45:27.428
It must've taken some nerve

45:28.025 --> 45:31.029
to penetrate yourself not once, but twice.

45:31.662 --> 45:33.903
Did you cry out from the pain?

45:35.099 --> 45:36.442
I don't remember.

45:36.534 --> 45:37.842
Well, it don't matter,

45:38.236 --> 45:40.580
'cause, son,
you damn sure about to cry out now.

45:41.005 --> 45:42.712
Please, please, please.

45:43.174 --> 45:44.346
I did it because I love her.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.549
You what?

45:47.612 --> 45:51.185
I could tell from the second she walked in
that we had a connection,

45:51.849 --> 45:55.092
that she was special,
that she wasn't like those other girls.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.727
I never hurt her.

45:57.788 --> 46:00.029
I would never hurt her.

46:00.358 --> 46:02.395
That's why I hurt myself instead.

46:03.027 --> 46:07.237
I love her,
but I don't have the power to make her mine.

46:11.035 --> 46:12.241
I'm sorry.

46:13.437 --> 46:14.780
I'm sorry.

46:15.139 --> 46:16.550
I loved her.

46:24.482 --> 46:25.756
Get out of here.

46:26.450 --> 46:29.294
Go on, get out of here
before I change my mind.

46:34.892 --> 46:38.396
You do understand now
that we need to leave, right, Darryl?

46:39.330 --> 46:41.105
You get that, finally?

46:41.899 --> 46:43.742
Nothing left for us here.

46:44.235 --> 46:45.805
We need to go.

46:47.071 --> 46:49.574
Danny ain't even cold yet,
and you're all set to run?

46:50.074 --> 46:52.350
I'm just trying to keep us out of prison.

46:53.110 --> 46:56.421
Well-nigh impossible this far along,
but I'm trying.

46:57.748 --> 46:59.421
Why you ain't even crying?

47:01.419 --> 47:03.092
You don't give a shit?

47:03.154 --> 47:07.000
If I didn't give a shit,
I would have cut out a long time ago.

47:09.293 --> 47:13.173
Now, for all of Daddy's shortcomings,
he knew when to fold up.

47:14.765 --> 47:18.338
Phosphates dried out, he got us out of there.

47:19.937 --> 47:22.611
Land scams ran their course, he got us out.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.286
Whole time he kept the family together.

47:26.811 --> 47:28.484
That's my job now.

47:29.613 --> 47:31.354
Darryl, it's a hard truth,

47:31.716 --> 47:34.492
but you ain't ever gonna be
fit to stand in his shadow.

47:35.653 --> 47:37.132
That's rich

47:37.988 --> 47:41.458
coming from a woman
so ashamed of her own son,

47:41.959 --> 47:44.303
she don't even admit she got one.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.705
Little piece of shit.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.083
Wendy. Hey, I'm sorry.

47:57.675 --> 47:59.086
I'm sorry. Hey.

48:05.683 --> 48:07.321
You want to go?

48:09.220 --> 48:10.927
Yeah, yeah.

48:14.258 --> 48:16.067
Get up. You tough, right?

48:16.160 --> 48:17.366
Get up!

48:19.330 --> 48:20.536
Yeah.

48:23.367 --> 48:25.347
You crying now, right, bitch?

48:26.270 --> 48:27.340
I hate you!

48:32.543 --> 48:33.749
Kendal!

48:37.848 --> 48:41.455
You need to decide right now
whose side you're on.

48:45.055 --> 48:46.796
You a Crowe or not?

48:47.091 --> 48:48.092
Yeah.

48:48.692 --> 48:49.693
Say it.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.362
I'm a Crowe.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.370
I love you.

49:00.237 --> 49:03.047
Seminole Indians do this down the glades.

49:03.808 --> 49:07.984
My daddy' your grandpa,
did this to me when I was your age.

49:08.813 --> 49:10.224
Blood bond.

49:10.748 --> 49:12.557
Stronger than a gator's hide.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.555
Yeah.

49:17.655 --> 49:19.259
We share blood,

49:20.057 --> 49:21.434
we share everything.

49:25.062 --> 49:28.009
Starting right now, clean slate between us.

49:28.332 --> 49:30.471
We ain't got no secrets, do we?

49:31.969 --> 49:33.471
You got to say it, Kendal.

49:33.771 --> 49:35.182
No secrets.

49:35.339 --> 49:36.750
You a man now.

49:37.641 --> 49:40.588
And being a man
comes with responsibilities.

49:41.278 --> 49:42.757
You ready to be a man?

49:45.249 --> 49:47.785
I know you are.
