00:00.539 --> 00:02.171
<i>Previously on "Bitten"...</i>

00:02.199 --> 00:03.365
(Grunt of pain)

00:03.391 --> 00:04.692
Remember our buddy Michael Braxton?

00:04.726 --> 00:06.193
Well, he's missing. Last night,

00:06.227 --> 00:07.861
he said he was going to
go over to your place,

00:07.885 --> 00:09.152
make things square.

00:09.187 --> 00:11.288
In the meantime, we have
two Mutts to deal with.

00:11.322 --> 00:14.355
We need to identify the dead one from
the rave, and find out who made him.

00:14.387 --> 00:16.988
There is someone out there who knows
the Mutt rumour mill better than us.

00:17.022 --> 00:18.156
Karl Marsten.

00:18.190 --> 00:19.824
What we want to know is who bit him.

00:19.858 --> 00:21.759
I'll find out who bit
your little problem.

00:21.794 --> 00:23.027
Clay: Keeps a scrapbook.

00:23.061 --> 00:24.228
A nurse in Milwaukee,

00:24.263 --> 00:25.997
a college student in Cleveland.

00:26.031 --> 00:27.631
All tortured, all killed.

00:27.666 --> 00:30.755
Someone's turning psychotic
murderers into werewolves.

00:30.787 --> 00:31.888
Zachary Cain.

00:31.922 --> 00:33.255
Clay: Something's not right.

00:33.289 --> 00:35.024
Cain's not smart enough
come up with a plan.

00:35.058 --> 00:36.191
Karl Marsten...

00:36.226 --> 00:37.792
Since when do Mutts work together?

00:37.827 --> 00:38.994
Never.

00:39.029 --> 00:40.429
Daniel Santos.

00:40.463 --> 00:42.543
Convince Jeremy and Clay to
let me come to Stonehaven.

00:42.565 --> 00:45.167
Let's talk about joining forces
to deal with the situation.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.869
First, they convert new Mutts.

00:47.904 --> 00:49.471
We made you, we own you.

00:49.506 --> 00:51.706
Second, they attack us directly,

00:51.741 --> 00:52.874
murdering people.

00:52.909 --> 00:54.910
(Suspenseful ♪)

00:54.944 --> 00:58.547
( ♪ )

00:58.581 --> 00:59.814
Let him try.

01:04.744 --> 01:06.664
Jeremy: Turning humans
into an army of werewolves

01:06.689 --> 01:07.822
is bad enough.

01:07.857 --> 01:09.723
But recruiting serial killers?

01:09.758 --> 01:13.528
Marsten and Cain are coming after
us with both barrels loaded.

01:13.562 --> 01:15.296
Did you see this one?

01:15.330 --> 01:17.998
Skinned her.

01:18.033 --> 01:19.667
That's enough.

01:19.701 --> 01:22.036
The rate they're able to
drop dead bodies on us,

01:22.071 --> 01:24.272
they can't be far.

01:24.306 --> 01:27.074
Marsten showed up pretty quickly
after Nick called him at the bar.

01:27.108 --> 01:29.476
So I say we search
between here and Syracuse.

01:29.510 --> 01:32.212
I am not sending anybody blindly out

01:32.246 --> 01:34.214
chasing after Marsten and Cain.

01:34.248 --> 01:35.716
We need to be strategic about this.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.952
I've sent word through
Logan to Daniel Santos

01:37.986 --> 01:39.419
that I'm willing to talk.

01:39.454 --> 01:41.821
Ha! Santos doesn't talk so much as lie.

01:41.855 --> 01:43.957
He wants to trade information he has

01:43.991 --> 01:45.492
for reinstatement into the Pack.

01:45.526 --> 01:47.094
And I know he cannot be trusted,

01:47.128 --> 01:49.409
but I am at least willing to
listen to what he has to say.

01:49.430 --> 01:50.964
The last member of the Santos family

01:50.998 --> 01:52.599
that walked through our
doors tried to kill you.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.634
Jeremy: Our backs are
up against a wall here.

01:54.668 --> 01:57.237
I need something to smoke
Marsten and his crew out.

01:57.271 --> 01:59.538
Then let me lure this one.

01:59.573 --> 02:00.907
Let me be the bait.

02:00.941 --> 02:02.942
I'm the "bitch" that he wants.

02:05.913 --> 02:07.080
No.

02:07.114 --> 02:09.048
We will find them together.

02:12.285 --> 02:13.452
Elena...

02:19.359 --> 02:21.059
(Mixed chatter)

02:22.790 --> 02:24.430
Pete: We're only in
town a few days, dude.

02:24.431 --> 02:26.031
Just think about it, okay?

02:26.065 --> 02:27.699
Canadian girls.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.236
They're hot and they're polite.

02:30.270 --> 02:33.304
So what, they thank you for
never calling them again?

02:33.339 --> 02:34.773
Exactly!

02:34.807 --> 02:37.709
I'm going to use that.
(Mixed chuckling)

02:37.744 --> 02:39.978
Can I help you?

02:40.013 --> 02:43.281
No, I'm waiting for Dr. Danvers. Thanks.

02:43.315 --> 02:44.750
Dr. Danvers.

02:44.784 --> 02:46.151
He's a bit of a brooder.

02:46.185 --> 02:48.486
I'm... I'm just here for the typist job.

02:48.521 --> 02:51.722
You, uh... you sure you
want to work for him?

02:51.757 --> 02:54.259
I'm sure I want to pay my tuition, yeah.

02:54.293 --> 02:56.961
Why don't you just get your
parents to pay for it?

02:56.995 --> 02:58.563
My parents are dead.

02:58.597 --> 03:01.566
Look, I just saw the job posting,
I grabbed it and ran up here.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.135
...excuse me. Dude, I wanted to
show you this thing over here...

03:04.169 --> 03:06.570
As for Dr. Danvers, I'm pretty
sure I can get up to speed

03:06.604 --> 03:09.173
on whatever it is that he does.

03:11.376 --> 03:12.943
He does this.

03:15.213 --> 03:17.648
Look, about the whole parents thing.

03:17.683 --> 03:18.883
It's not a sob story.

03:18.917 --> 03:21.485
I don't want you to think that it is.

03:27.058 --> 03:29.092
I'm sorry, I thought you were a student.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.662
Yeah, I... I get that often.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.433
Sorry.

03:39.103 --> 03:41.838
Um... l... listen, I'm a little tied up

03:41.872 --> 03:43.740
- with my cousins at the moment, but can...
- Yeah.

03:43.774 --> 03:46.309
Can you come back tomorrow?

03:46.343 --> 03:47.677
Okay.

03:47.712 --> 03:49.312
- Great.
- Okay.

03:55.586 --> 03:57.353
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

03:59.356 --> 04:00.989
(In Southern accent) Well, I do declare!

04:01.024 --> 04:02.925
That girl put a blush on your cheeks,

04:02.959 --> 04:05.194
the likes of which
I've never seen before.

04:05.229 --> 04:06.929
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:06.963 --> 04:08.231
(Chuckling)
(Heavy sigh)

04:08.265 --> 04:09.699
Dude, careful.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.400
That is a minefield you do
not know how to navigate.

04:12.435 --> 04:14.536
- I can give you some tips.
- No.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.072
Nothing is going to happen.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.110
That's Braxton's truck, all right.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.510
Who called it in?

04:22.545 --> 04:24.246
It's an anonymous tip.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.781
Sheriff?

04:25.815 --> 04:28.450
This is some real Manson family
business we got going on here.

04:28.484 --> 04:30.452
Yeah, if the guy's a
trigger-happy drinker,

04:30.486 --> 04:32.587
he could've hit a pothole
and shot himself.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.791
With all that's gone on,

04:36.825 --> 04:39.261
it's getting kind of hard not
to think foul play, isn't it?

You might be on to

There's a lot of cabins and
warehouses between here and Syracuse.

05:33.838 --> 05:35.172
Doesn't matter.

05:35.206 --> 05:37.174
We got our orders.

05:37.208 --> 05:39.242
We feign some business at Nick's club.

05:39.277 --> 05:40.743
He'll cover for us.

05:40.778 --> 05:44.113
We track the area, see what we can find.

05:44.147 --> 05:46.683
You'd go against Jeremy?

05:49.453 --> 05:50.853
Right now, I would.

05:53.256 --> 05:55.325
(Car approaching, short siren blast)

05:56.827 --> 05:59.461
I haven't seen Braxton since
his dog lunged at Elena.

05:59.495 --> 06:01.831
Word is, he was coming up
here to have it out with you.

06:01.865 --> 06:03.065
His dog's still missing.

06:03.099 --> 06:06.120
His dog never showed up. Neither did he.

06:06.151 --> 06:08.204
Yeah, well, vehicle was found deserted

06:08.238 --> 06:09.805
right by your property line.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.273
Are we being accused of something here?

06:11.308 --> 06:12.507
There's a trail of blood,

06:12.542 --> 06:14.443
leads from his truck towards your land.

06:14.477 --> 06:16.044
He could be out here somewhere,

06:16.078 --> 06:17.879
injured or incapacitated.

06:17.913 --> 06:19.448
If I did anything to the guy,

06:19.482 --> 06:21.483
why would I leave his truck
at the edge of our property?

06:21.517 --> 06:22.917
It suggests proximity.

06:22.952 --> 06:24.953
And so here we are, again.

06:24.987 --> 06:28.690
But we have nothing to do with
this other than proximity.

06:28.725 --> 06:31.359
Look, the tow truck driver
is a friend of Braxton's.

06:31.393 --> 06:32.961
In about 20 minutes,
word is going to hit town

06:32.995 --> 06:35.263
and people are going to start
pointing fingers at you.

06:35.297 --> 06:36.530
So let them point.

06:36.565 --> 06:37.966
I didn't do anything.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.401
We all want this to come to a quick end.

06:40.435 --> 06:42.937
You are more than welcome
to search the property.

06:42.972 --> 06:44.438
Now, it is a big piece of land.

06:44.473 --> 06:46.374
Maybe we should organize a search party.

06:46.408 --> 06:48.376
Some locals, members of my family,

06:48.410 --> 06:49.810
they know the land.

06:49.845 --> 06:52.880
If Michael Braxton's here,
we'll find him.

06:52.914 --> 06:56.417
(Sigh)
I'd appreciate that.

06:56.451 --> 06:58.419
Yeah, I'm going to go to town
and round up some people.

06:58.453 --> 06:59.720
Deputy O'Neil, you stay here

06:59.755 --> 07:01.121
and deal with them as they arrive.

07:05.894 --> 07:07.294
(Door closing)

07:09.130 --> 07:12.266
I'm sure you heard that you will
be helping with the search.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.668
This is Marsten's doing, I know it.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.305
He must've heard Braxton
running his mouth off in town,

07:18.339 --> 07:20.407
nabbed him, and then dumped his truck.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.475
And hung it on us.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.444
Not us.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.279
On Clay.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.814
There's a very real possibility

07:27.848 --> 07:30.082
that Braxton's body is out there.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.997
Mutts wouldn't leave him
alive to tell the truth.

07:32.019 --> 07:35.121
Jeremy: Which is why we are allowing
the police onto our property,

07:35.155 --> 07:37.623
and which is why we will help them look.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.158
If Braxton is here,

07:39.192 --> 07:41.160
this is the best chance for
us to mitigate the situation

07:41.194 --> 07:42.395
when the body is found.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.829
So why not stall them?

07:43.863 --> 07:45.497
Let me rip out there
and see what's what.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.199
Not with Deputy Dipshit keeping watch.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.735
The police are going to get a
search warrant for this house.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.737
And the last thing we need

07:51.771 --> 07:53.972
is anybody poking around in here.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.508
So we will help them.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.980
Barely making mortgage payments

08:02.014 --> 08:04.883
these guys living like it's
goddamn Skyfall up here.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.621
No way. No way!

08:09.656 --> 08:12.090
The Danvers family has offered
to help with the search.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.492
There is no way that he's
going on this search.

08:14.526 --> 08:15.927
This town's been through a lot,

08:15.962 --> 08:17.162
I'm just looking to help.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.130
Oh, yeah, you want to help?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.999
Why don't you help by making me
not have to look at your face?

08:21.033 --> 08:23.601
Stand down, everyone. We
have a long day ahead of us.

08:23.635 --> 08:25.303
Sheriff Morgan,

08:25.338 --> 08:28.019
Clay and I have some family business
that we could attend to inside.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.075
Clay?

08:31.109 --> 08:32.543
Morgan: Here's how we're
going to run this.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.544
We have 100-acre plot of land to cover.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.448
We're going to fan out, we're going
to march it in a grid formation.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.284
Keep the person on either
side of you within sight.

08:40.318 --> 08:44.355
If Michael Braxton is out
there, we will find him.

08:44.389 --> 08:47.691
(Sigh)
Okay.

08:47.725 --> 08:49.493
It's not about the money.

08:49.527 --> 08:50.927
(High-pitched ring)

08:50.962 --> 08:53.042
Elena's voice:
<i>Well, I do need the money, but it's...</i>

08:53.064 --> 08:54.564
It's more than that to me.

08:54.599 --> 08:56.666
<i>I read your book.</i>

08:56.701 --> 08:58.702
<i>Every single page.</i>

08:58.736 --> 09:03.306
That's not right. Why wouldn't
I read every single page?

09:03.340 --> 09:04.440
Okay...

09:15.586 --> 09:18.087
- Oh, if you were leaving, I can...

I was opening the door for you.

09:27.964 --> 09:29.899

the point in unpacking

09:31.968 --> 09:34.870
when I just have to pack it again
at the end of the semester.

09:34.905 --> 09:37.606
What's the point of inhaling if
you're just going to exhale?

09:39.910 --> 09:42.411
Zeus, right?

09:42.445 --> 09:44.446
It's beautiful.

09:46.416 --> 09:48.717
Just as he's about to seduce Leda.

09:48.752 --> 09:51.186
He couldn't come to
her in his true form,

09:51.220 --> 09:53.188
because she wouldn't have him.

09:53.222 --> 09:54.689
But he loved her.

09:54.723 --> 09:56.791
See yesterday, I didn't know that.

09:56.825 --> 09:58.560
But I read your book.

09:58.594 --> 10:00.295
You read my book...

10:00.329 --> 10:02.597

10:10.706 --> 10:12.239

10:29.657 --> 10:32.759

- Well, for starters, other than my book,

10:32.794 --> 10:36.363
do you know anything about
anthropomorphic religions?

10:36.398 --> 10:38.799
Well, the-the job is
for a typist, not a T.A.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.867
- So, I don't see...
- But I dictate,

10:40.902 --> 10:43.070
and there's a lot of
specific terminology.

10:43.104 --> 10:46.206
I don't have time to train you.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.440
I don't need to be trained.

10:47.475 --> 10:49.309
I'm actually quite self-sufficient.

10:49.343 --> 10:51.223
So if you just point me
in the right direction...

10:51.245 --> 10:53.580
Right.

10:53.615 --> 10:56.949
How do you spell "Tlingit"?

10:56.984 --> 10:58.251
Seriously?

10:58.285 --> 10:59.819
It'll be part of my new book.

10:59.853 --> 11:04.124
So, how do you spell it?

11:04.158 --> 11:05.958
Does it start with "F-U"?

11:09.396 --> 11:12.297
You know what? If you don't
want to hire me, then don't.

11:12.332 --> 11:14.867
But stop looking for reasons not to.

11:14.901 --> 11:17.436
Because there aren't any.

11:19.172 --> 11:21.306

11:21.341 --> 11:24.777

T-L-I-N-G-I-T.

11:34.387 --> 11:36.221

12:29.294 --> 12:32.097
I hate the thought of letting you out,

12:32.131 --> 12:34.398
regardless of the sentence served.

12:34.433 --> 12:38.436
The Parole Board turned you down
three times for good reason.

12:38.470 --> 12:40.471
I needed to stay in here,

12:40.506 --> 12:44.108

12:44.143 --> 12:45.743

13:05.997 --> 13:09.299

13:09.333 --> 13:11.568

13:11.602 --> 13:13.370
How old is she?

13:13.404 --> 13:16.439
Like I said, I'm done with that.

13:27.151 --> 13:29.686
I should be out there.

13:38.261 --> 13:40.296

13:40.330 --> 13:42.198
You had already been bitten.

13:42.232 --> 13:46.835
You were just this feral little
boy, abandoned in the swamp.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.738
Do you remember how many days I had
to sit quietly on that tree stump

13:49.772 --> 13:52.974
until you would approach me?
Till you learned to trust me?

13:53.009 --> 13:54.577
Weeks.

13:54.611 --> 13:57.646
Am I sitting on a metaphorical
tree stump right now?

13:57.681 --> 13:58.847
No.

14:01.184 --> 14:03.051
Clay, every decision I make

14:03.086 --> 14:05.721
is to protect the future of this Pack.

14:05.755 --> 14:07.689

Elena: (On phone) <i>- Uhh...</i>

14:23.739 --> 14:25.607
<i>- It's complicated.</i>
- Okay,

14:25.641 --> 14:27.942
I don't want to turn this into
an Olympics of complicated,

14:27.976 --> 14:30.645
but we are gold medalling
over here right now.

14:30.679 --> 14:33.447
- What's happening?
<i>- Becky's other bridesmaid has appendicitis</i>

14:33.481 --> 14:35.515
and now she can't fly back from England,

14:35.550 --> 14:38.652
so Becky is in a tailspin,
and she's not very good

14:38.686 --> 14:39.887
<i>with change.</i>

14:39.921 --> 14:42.389

<i>- Yes!</i>

14:42.423 --> 14:44.792
Is there any way you can step in?

14:44.826 --> 14:46.393
- Um...
<i>- Becky adores you,</i>

14:46.427 --> 14:47.694
the dress is already here in Toronto,

14:47.729 --> 14:49.563
it just needs a little snip-tuck.

14:49.597 --> 14:53.634
- Uhh... <i>- And it would
also mean you coming back A.S.A.P.</i>

14:54.636 --> 14:56.202

15:14.188 --> 15:15.521

15:15.555 --> 15:17.023
Uh, that, I do not know.

15:17.057 --> 15:18.357
Well, when's the funeral?

15:18.392 --> 15:19.926
Few days ago.

15:21.061 --> 15:22.495
She didn't want you there?

15:22.529 --> 15:24.530
Did you take a date to Dad's funeral?

15:24.564 --> 15:26.231
Yeah, but you're hardly a date.

15:26.266 --> 15:27.800
Yeah, you're starting to

15:35.575 --> 15:37.643
What did you hear?

15:37.678 --> 15:41.280
A man's voice, telling you he loves you.

15:41.314 --> 15:42.514
Does Clay know?

15:42.548 --> 15:45.383
Just Logan and Jeremy.

15:45.418 --> 15:47.719
And now you.

15:47.753 --> 15:50.722
Look, I left Stonehaven, Nick.

15:50.756 --> 15:52.590

start on that last night.

15:56.595 --> 15:57.895

15:59.665 --> 16:00.799
I'll help you.

be very lucky to have you.

is because of you, Clay.

37:00.328 --> 37:02.395
You've been in contact with Marsten?

37:02.430 --> 37:04.431
Grapevine.

37:04.465 --> 37:07.134
And what I hear is that for the two years

37:07.168 --> 37:08.836
that Elena was your sidekick,

37:08.870 --> 37:11.338
and the two of you policed the Mutts,

37:11.372 --> 37:14.508
she at least brought some humanity.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.376
But you on your own?

37:16.410 --> 37:17.577
Brutal.

37:17.612 --> 37:19.279
Vindictive, even.

37:19.313 --> 37:22.449
An individual Mutt stands
no chance against you.

37:22.483 --> 37:24.484
They had no choice but to band together.

37:24.519 --> 37:27.420
And they're creating a psycho
army to help in the process.

37:27.455 --> 37:29.022
Clay: I didn't do anything to Marsten.

37:29.056 --> 37:31.024
If this is about Clay,

37:31.058 --> 37:32.258
why did they kill Pete?

37:32.292 --> 37:33.660
To knock you off your game.

37:33.694 --> 37:36.495
To send Clay out on a blind rage.

37:36.530 --> 37:41.067
Look, the King moves
one square at a time.

37:41.101 --> 37:43.803
Thoughtful, methodical.

37:43.837 --> 37:46.405
And the Queen...

37:46.439 --> 37:48.641
Well, she can do whatever she wants.

37:48.675 --> 37:50.176
But the rook?

37:50.210 --> 37:51.877
Stuck in a rut.

37:51.911 --> 37:53.912
Zigzag. Zigzag.

37:53.946 --> 37:56.582
We all know that you act irrationally.

37:56.616 --> 37:58.784
You're impulsive. You make mistakes.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.686
- Isn't that right, Elena?
- That's enough.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.854
Still a slimeball, Santos.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.222
Nothing's changed.

38:04.256 --> 38:07.192
Please... understand,

38:07.226 --> 38:09.394
what I've said comes
from good intentions.

38:09.428 --> 38:11.629
Those being...

38:11.664 --> 38:13.431
reinstatement to the Pack.

38:15.101 --> 38:18.436
Well, we'll give that due consideration.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.371
Nick, let's show him out.

38:22.608 --> 38:23.774
Yeah.

38:27.012 --> 38:28.546
Don't forget.

38:28.581 --> 38:31.015
The Queen can make any move she wants.

38:49.601 --> 38:51.501
(Door closing)

38:51.536 --> 38:53.970
Nick told me what happened.

38:54.004 --> 38:56.240
I should've been out there with you.

38:59.910 --> 39:05.449
I had to drag a dead body
across the property today

39:05.483 --> 39:08.317
to protect you and the Pack.

39:08.352 --> 39:10.386
And if that wasn't enough,
I couldn't grab him,

39:10.420 --> 39:12.989
because my prints would be all over him.

39:13.023 --> 39:16.993
So I had to do the one thing
that I hate the most.

39:17.027 --> 39:19.062
I had to Change.

39:19.096 --> 39:22.698
And all of this, because of you.

39:22.733 --> 39:27.202
You know if I could take it back...

39:27.237 --> 39:28.804
the bite...

39:28.838 --> 39:30.606
But you can't.

39:30.641 --> 39:34.343
It's impossible for you to understand,

39:34.378 --> 39:36.945
but I did it because I love you.

What we had...

42:10.361 --> 42:12.129
it was special.

42:12.163 --> 42:15.265
Maybe someone should make
them hurt a little too, huh?

42:15.300 --> 42:17.802
At least one of them in particular.
