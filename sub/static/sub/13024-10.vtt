01:03.689 --> 01:06.441
Somewhere inside Sendak's memories
we should be able to find

01:06.525 --> 01:10.112
the inside information that gives us
the key to take down Zarkon.

01:10.195 --> 01:13.615
I don't think your father would approve
of searching through an enemy's memories.

01:13.699 --> 01:17.619
I know, but we have to do
everything we can to defeat Zarkon.

01:17.703 --> 01:18.996
Once we learn all his weaknesses,

01:19.079 --> 01:22.124
we can drive up to his front door
and challenge him to a fight.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.252
Winner gets the universe.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.547
Anything good yet, Pidge?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.966
We were only able to salvage
bits and pieces.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.759
We need something to work with.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.721
Right now, we don't even have
a decent map of the empire.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.432
Who needs a map?
After 10,000 years of conquering,

01:38.515 --> 01:41.393
I could probably fire my bayard
at any random point in space

01:41.476 --> 01:42.686
and hit a Galra ship.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.648
If we could just find troop locations
or supply routes,

01:46.732 --> 01:48.567
small targets we could hit-and-run,

01:48.650 --> 01:51.069
then we could start to free planets
one by one.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.530
Boring. I want the big kaboom.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.700
Zarkon's been building his empire
for 10,000 years.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.702
We're not going to tear it down overnight

01:58.785 --> 02:01.246
with five inexperienced pilots
and one support ship.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.749
Hitting him where he lives
would be a huge mistake.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.168
Okay, I've cross-referenced
Sendak's memories

02:06.251 --> 02:09.128
with the info I got
from the downed ship back on Arus.

02:09.211 --> 02:12.591
Most of it was a garbled mess,
but one thing kept repeating,

02:12.674 --> 02:15.552
something called a "Universal Station."

02:15.636 --> 02:17.095
Universal Station?

02:17.179 --> 02:19.723
Like, the kind of station
that controls the entire universe?

02:19.806 --> 02:23.352
Well, we are translating it from Galra,
so it could also be "Galactic Hub."

02:23.435 --> 02:25.270
Or "Space Base"!

02:28.106 --> 02:28.940
What?

02:29.024 --> 02:33.195
I'm pulling up the location
of your Universal Hub Station Base

02:33.278 --> 02:35.238
on our screens now.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.617
So, where is it?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.660
I don't know.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.829
Our long-range sensors are unable
to find anything at those coordinates.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.376
Maybe he remembered it wrong.

02:47.459 --> 02:51.171
Or maybe we just stumbled across
a top-secret base in Sendak's memories.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.509
Only one way to find out.
Let's go take a look.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.151
We should be close enough
to get a good scan,

03:13.235 --> 03:15.695
but far enough away
to avoid being noticed.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.579
<i>There it is.</i>

03:29.501 --> 03:31.670
It appears the gravitation
between the two planets

03:31.753 --> 03:33.588
warps the electron
emission spectrum enough

03:33.672 --> 03:36.049
to keep the planet off
the deep space scanners.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.511
So, you can only see it
if you really know where to look.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.646
<i>This place must handle shipments
from all over the Galra Empire.</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:53.358
If this is some big airport where
shipments come and go, why is it hidden?

03:53.442 --> 03:55.652
There must be more to this
than we're seeing.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.114
Then, we'd better go down to take a look.
We'll need to enter here:

03:59.197 --> 04:00.782
the central control building.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.161
I'm sorry, Princess, did you say "we"?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.829
I'm going with you.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.206
I've traveled through the Galra
transportation hubs many times

04:08.290 --> 04:10.000
with my father before the war began.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.252
I know more about them than any of you.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.337
Princess, I'd rather you stay here.

04:14.421 --> 04:18.175
I'm a part of this fight against Zarkon
as much as anyone. I'm going.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.968
Does anyone have a problem with that?

04:20.051 --> 04:22.012
Uh...

04:25.140 --> 04:27.768
Fine. Suit up.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.519
<i>Huh?</i>

04:34.024 --> 04:36.735
<i>We'll go in low, fast,
and hopefully undetected.</i>

04:36.818 --> 04:38.987
<i>Coming around the dark side
of the nearest planet</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:41.239
<i>should keep them
from getting a visual on us.</i>

04:41.323 --> 04:43.492
<i>Thanks to Pidge's modifications
to the Green Lion,</i>

04:43.575 --> 04:45.952
<i>we'll have 30 seconds of cloaking.</i>

04:46.036 --> 04:49.039
<i>I can flood their short-range
sensors with a radiation burst.</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:52.501
<i>That should buy you a minute or so, while
they assume it's cosmic interference.</i>

04:52.584 --> 04:55.796
<i>But, after that,
it's up to you to be out of sight.</i>

04:59.800 --> 05:04.137
<i>Interference clear in three, two, one.</i>

05:07.599 --> 05:09.392
- Psst! Hey!
- Hmm?

05:23.615 --> 05:26.117
- How's it look out there?
- All clear.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.328
This shouldn't take too long.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.081
We'll have all the information
we need in a few minutes.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.166
Hunk and I have
made some improvements

05:33.250 --> 05:35.669
since the last time I tried
to download Galra info.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.921
We should get a nice,
clean translation immediately.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.423
Hunk had a great idea about how to do it.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.176
Do you guys remember when
we studied algorithms at the Garrison,

05:43.260 --> 05:46.388
and Mr. York told us that joke
about the ghost learning symbolic logic

05:46.471 --> 05:47.472
and innumerably infinite sets?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.057
Boring!

05:49.140 --> 05:50.600
Right, yeah, totally, it was boring.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.893
Anyway, the joke goes...

05:51.977 --> 05:55.355
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt,
but I think we got company.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.743
- Think we should get out of here?
- We just need a few more seconds.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.328
Stay low. We need this intel.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.789
Get down!

06:14.666 --> 06:15.500
<i>Huh?</i>

06:22.173 --> 06:25.260
He's still looking. I think he's waiting
for a signal or something.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.636
I got it.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.276
Whew.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.362
- Nice job, Hunk.
- Thanks.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.615
- Okay, download complete.
- What's it say?

06:46.698 --> 06:49.993
Nothing. This place doesn't have
any useful information.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.621
Just a schedule of the ships
coming in and out.

06:52.704 --> 06:56.458
- Well, I guess this mission was a bust.
- Let's get back to the Castle.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.961
Hold on. Pidge, do you know
where that ship is headed?

07:00.045 --> 07:02.964
Um, it's scheduled to be here
for about a half an hour,

07:03.048 --> 07:04.549
then head off to Central Command.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.551
That's where they have
the information we need,

07:06.635 --> 07:10.555
and I'm going to sneak aboard
that ship and get it for us.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.934
- What? No way!
- How are you going to get in?

07:15.977 --> 07:18.396
I'm going to walk right through the front.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.955
How the heck did you do that?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.082
The Alteans are
a chameleon-like people

07:37.165 --> 07:39.459
who can blend in
with the local populations.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.545
It's the ability that's made us
great explorers and diplomats

07:42.629 --> 07:43.713
throughout our history.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.049
So, can you turn into, like, a balloon?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.301
How many different colors
can you be at once?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.845
Aren't you afraid you'll rip your pants?

07:50.929 --> 07:55.642
No, just one at a time,
and I will need a change of costume.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.896
- I can use his uniform as a disguise.
- I can't let you go in there alone.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.149
Excuse me?
I do not need your permission.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.153
It's too dangerous.
I'm going in with you.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.781
You will stick out
like a Choferiak's nose.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.992
You're going to need that nose, Princess.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.203
Shiro's hand is made from Galra tech.
It's the only thing we have

08:15.286 --> 08:18.206
that will allow us to interface
with their systems and gather intel.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.458
I can monitor the download
remotely from here.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.671
- Fine, you can come.
- Uh, you guys better hurry up

08:24.754 --> 08:28.383
if you want to get on and off before
the ship leaves for Zarkon central.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.719
How are you going to get Shiro on board?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.117
Halt.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.175
Move along.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.722
Whew.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.685
They're in.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.147
What do you think they have
in all those giant containers?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.858
Well, I suspect that it's sporks.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.280
This is an advanced race
we're talking about here.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.658
Surely, they've learned
that it's foolish to have forks and spoons

09:35.742 --> 09:38.203
when one tool will efficiently do the job.

09:39.204 --> 09:43.124
Maybe this guy will tell us.
What is coming in and out of this station?

09:43.208 --> 09:47.837
<i>Interrogation detected.
Initiating lockdown.</i>

09:49.756 --> 09:51.341
Not talking, eh?

09:54.219 --> 09:57.013
Whoa. Check out this guy.

09:58.389 --> 10:01.226
Whatever's happening here
that requires the base to be kept secret

10:01.309 --> 10:03.603
must have something to do
with that scary dude.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.691
I'm going to go check it out.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.487
How about we just lay low
and you don't blow our cover?

10:13.446 --> 10:18.493
Keith, think about what you're doing.
Don't walk through that door!

10:22.497 --> 10:26.751
- I think I told him.
- You are a paragon of leadership, Lance.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.691
Shiro, are you all right?

10:49.774 --> 10:53.194
I just remembered how I escaped
from the Galra prison ship.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.823
Listen, most of the ship's personnel
are sentries.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.824
So?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.618
When I was a prisoner,
I timed their pattern.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.663
- Do you remember it?
- Let's find out.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.097
Why are you hitting yourself?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.974
Stop hitting yourself!
Quit hitting yourself!

12:06.309 --> 12:07.977
Stop torturing it, Hunk.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.106
I'm sorry. I just...
I need something to keep me busy,

12:12.190 --> 12:14.108
so I'm not worried
about Keith getting caught,

12:14.192 --> 12:16.361
or Shiro and Allura getting
blasted by robot things,

12:16.444 --> 12:18.363
or someone finding us here,
like, right now...

12:18.446 --> 12:22.075
Stop it, Hunk!
I think we can teach it to help us.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.577
Would you like to help us, Mr. Robot?

12:27.455 --> 12:28.331
Whoops.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.709
Quick question. Does Allura talk about me
when I'm not in the room?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.336
Oh, yeah, all the time.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.337
Really?

12:34.420 --> 12:38.841
Yeah, yeah. She's all like, "Oh, Lance.
He looks so fine. I'm all atwitter."

12:38.925 --> 12:42.220
Then, she turns red and she makes me
swear not to tell anyone.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.430
I knew it!

12:45.223 --> 12:46.182
Whoops.

14:13.352 --> 14:17.565
We only have a few minutes before
the next patrol comes by. Watch the door.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.108
Got it.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.826
Okay, Pidge, start the download.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.828
<i>Generating access code.</i>

14:32.455 --> 14:33.748
<i>We're in.</i>

14:36.376 --> 14:39.379
- Pidge, I think there's a problem.
- Sit tight.

14:39.462 --> 14:43.508
- I'm trying to work around this.
<i>- Scanning for information.</i>

14:43.591 --> 14:45.802
<i>- Pidge?
- I'm on it, I'm on it!</i>

14:46.969 --> 14:50.014
What's going on here? Who are you?

14:50.098 --> 14:53.643
It's about time you got here.
Where is the rest of your squad?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.646
- Uh, what squad?
- Hurry up, Pidge.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.563
Almost there.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.276
The squad that is to escort me
and my associate to our ship.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.153
Who's back there? What's going on?

15:04.237 --> 15:08.324
We are part of Zarkon's high command.
Our work must not be disturbed.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.785
Where's Chief Information Officer Plytox?

15:11.953 --> 15:15.123
Uh, he's in there. Say hello, Plyrox.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.250
Uh...

15:17.333 --> 15:18.793
It's "Plytox"!

15:19.627 --> 15:21.838
Oh, sorry. See?

15:21.921 --> 15:26.426
<i>Oh. Vrepit sa, sir!
I get his name wrong all the time, too.</i>

15:28.803 --> 15:30.096
Whew.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.646
Coran, you need to see this.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.444
- I've never seen anything like it.
- What is that?

15:44.527 --> 15:47.863
<i>The material is quintessence,
the substance with</i>

15:47.864 --> 15:51.200
<i>the highest known energy per
unit volume in the universe.</i>

15:51.284 --> 15:54.328
Hey, nice job, Pidge!
You made him work for us.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.247
What? Impossible.

15:56.330 --> 16:00.042
<i>Raw quintessence material is transported
here from throughout the galaxy</i>

16:00.126 --> 16:02.753
<i>and refined into standardized
Galra fuel requirements.</i>

16:02.837 --> 16:04.297
<i>Did you guys hear that?</i>

16:04.380 --> 16:07.592
I can't believe it! They've found
a new way acquire quintessence!

16:07.675 --> 16:11.179
Guys, I'm going to steal
some of this quint-whatever.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.891
- Um...
- Huh?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.270
Do you think I could get
assigned to Zarkon's unit?

16:19.353 --> 16:21.022
Nothing happens on this ship.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.482
Oh, well, I don't know.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.193
What's your bloodthirstiness
on a scale of one to five?

16:25.276 --> 16:28.905
One being "No, thanks, I'm full,"
and five being "Unquenchable."

16:29.739 --> 16:31.157
Hmm...

16:31.240 --> 16:33.493
If I'm being honest, about a three.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.161
We can work on that.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.245
Huh?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.288
Huh?

16:37.371 --> 16:41.292
<i>Fugitive prisoner 117-9875 detected.</i>

16:41.375 --> 16:43.836
<i>Remain where you are. Security alerted.</i>

16:47.131 --> 16:49.467
Uh, help! Intruders!

16:51.177 --> 16:53.513
- I think we're in trouble.
- You think?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.357
What?

17:04.440 --> 17:05.858
Let's go!

17:37.223 --> 17:38.808
Mm?

17:47.608 --> 17:50.111
Okay, plan B!

18:24.562 --> 18:27.732
Pidge, I need an extraction now! Hurry!

18:27.815 --> 18:30.693
Pidge, fire up the Green Lion!
We're coming in hot!

18:34.322 --> 18:35.197
What?

18:45.875 --> 18:49.795
I thought you said you'd traveled around
the galaxy. I mean, you fly a spaceship.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.965
How could you possibly not know
how to hold this correctly?

18:53.716 --> 18:56.177
I'm tense! This is a tense situation.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.097
<i>Secure hatches.
All personnel take positions for departure.</i>

19:01.932 --> 19:03.267
Let's move!

19:45.309 --> 19:48.437
<i>Get in!
We've got to get Shiro and Allura!</i>

19:53.442 --> 19:54.735
Huh?

20:03.452 --> 20:05.454
The escape pods are up here!

20:07.081 --> 20:08.874
<i>Formulating navigation.</i>

20:08.958 --> 20:11.961
<i>All crew assume secure
hyper-speed positions.</i>

20:19.719 --> 20:23.431
Hurry! We can't leave once the ship
goes into hyper-speed!

21:02.011 --> 21:04.472
It's taking off! Get in the pod!

21:04.555 --> 21:06.265
I'm not leaving you!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.689
You have to!

21:19.779 --> 21:20.821
No!

22:00.319 --> 22:01.946
Where's Allura?

22:05.199 --> 22:06.617
Shiro?

22:08.202 --> 22:10.371
She sacrificed herself to save me.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.332
So, she's still on that ship?

22:13.415 --> 22:16.085
The ship that's headed
to Zarkon's Central Command?

22:16.168 --> 22:19.672
The place that's way too dangerous
for us to attack?

22:19.755 --> 22:24.093
It doesn't matter how dangerous it is.
We can't let Zarkon get Allura.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.845
But you said going there
would be a huge mistake.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.598
You said for us to attack
that place head-on would be

22:29.682 --> 22:31.725
the dumbest possible thing
we could ever do.

22:32.643 --> 22:35.896
I know,
but now we don't have a choice.
