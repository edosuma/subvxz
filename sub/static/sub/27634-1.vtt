02:39.642 --> 02:41.471
- Psst.

02:44.923 --> 02:46.304
What are you doing here?

02:50.411 --> 02:52.793
I said what are you doing here?

02:52.827 --> 02:55.036
- I came,
I came here to pray.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.246
- Pray.

02:58.868 --> 02:59.868
Pray.

03:01.733 --> 03:03.079
You mean, like worship?

03:04.322 --> 03:05.530
- Yes.

03:09.879 --> 03:12.744
- Don't you know
that's against the law?

03:14.711 --> 03:15.711
Who are you?

03:19.060 --> 03:20.752
- I found some food.

03:20.786 --> 03:22.340
- Did anyone see you?

03:22.374 --> 03:24.997
- No.

03:25.032 --> 03:27.862
- What did I tell you about
going out in the daylight?

03:27.897 --> 03:31.935
- But I found it, I got.

03:34.593 --> 03:37.009
I see we have a dinner guest.

03:38.183 --> 03:40.634
- I caught her snooping
around out front.

03:40.668 --> 03:42.049
She looks like a valid.

03:43.775 --> 03:45.777
- Did you check her?

03:45.811 --> 03:47.227
- Um, you have the light.

03:48.642 --> 03:49.642
- Yeah.

03:53.543 --> 03:54.543
Okay.

03:56.408 --> 03:57.651
Okay.

03:58.962 --> 03:59.962
Sorry.

04:02.759 --> 04:04.796
This isn't gonna
hurt, I'm just gonna.

04:04.830 --> 04:06.660
I'm just gonna.

04:06.694 --> 04:08.489
- Well?

04:08.524 --> 04:11.009
- She's, she's
a valid, so, um.

04:12.182 --> 04:13.391
- A valid.

04:13.425 --> 04:16.152
I should cut that arm off.

04:16.185 --> 04:17.636
Are you a spy?

04:19.776 --> 04:22.296
I think I've seen you
creeping around here before.

04:23.711 --> 04:24.711
What's this?

04:26.680 --> 04:27.681
- It's a book.

04:29.165 --> 04:31.340
- İt's a book.

04:31.374 --> 04:34.170
Look, it's a book!

04:34.204 --> 04:36.068
I know it's book.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.415
What kind of book?

04:38.830 --> 04:40.487
- It's called The Bible.

04:41.522 --> 04:43.731
The Word of God.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
- God?

04:47.563 --> 04:49.081
There is no God.

04:51.601 --> 04:52.671
Not anymore.

05:06.202 --> 05:07.652
- You can read?

05:09.792 --> 05:10.792
- Yes.

05:13.243 --> 05:14.797
- So you know what happened?

05:19.388 --> 05:20.734
Why do they hate us?

05:23.219 --> 05:24.324
- They don't hate you.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.429
They're afraid of you.

05:27.396 --> 05:29.432
Afraid of what's in your blood.

05:29.467 --> 05:30.571
- What's in our blood?

05:32.539 --> 05:37.440
- It started decades ago,
when they first discovered it.

05:38.407 --> 05:39.407
The gene.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.032
They called it the
Hamanaro strand.

05:46.622 --> 05:49.763
- The root of all violence.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.456
Our research has uncovered
that our genetic makeup

05:53.491 --> 05:57.460
is more than just our
physiological presence.

05:58.427 --> 05:59.497
It's deeper than that.

06:00.843 --> 06:02.465
Within some of us lies a gene

06:02.500 --> 06:05.537
that has been passed down
from generation to generation

06:06.435 --> 06:09.230
and started war after war.

06:10.197 --> 06:11.197
After war.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.823
If this gene is in your DNA,

06:15.858 --> 06:18.239
you will commit a violent crime.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.312
We'll have several speakers--

06:22.347 --> 06:24.107
- Do you think the
votes will pass?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.386
- I'm not concerned.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.423
- You know what
motivates people?

06:31.183 --> 06:32.183
Fear.

06:33.841 --> 06:35.429
- What are you suggesting?

06:35.464 --> 06:37.707
- That you stay on
your present course.

06:37.742 --> 06:40.917
It will only work
if people believe

06:40.952 --> 06:42.229
that it solves a problem.

06:44.058 --> 06:46.785
- Then I'll have to
make the problem worse.

06:46.820 --> 06:47.614
So then my solution

06:47.648 --> 06:48.753
is the best option.

06:50.755 --> 06:51.755
- Deliver the heir,

06:52.860 --> 06:55.622
and you'll have power
beyond your imagination.

06:55.656 --> 06:58.590
- And so, without further ado,

06:58.625 --> 07:01.973
please welcome to the
stage, Danel Turel.

07:14.192 --> 07:15.365
- Ladies and gentlemen.

07:16.850 --> 07:20.509
What I'm proposing may
very well end terrorism

07:20.543 --> 07:22.856
and mindless
violence altogether.

07:24.651 --> 07:28.448
We have, for once, a true
chance at world peace.

07:36.594 --> 07:39.493
- Dr. Bali announced his research
at the Geneva Conference.

07:39.528 --> 07:43.497
Last chat with the U.N.
President Danel Turel,

07:43.532 --> 07:45.844
proposing a blood
mapping program

07:45.879 --> 07:49.227
to register all person
into a database.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.437
That will make them known
who are the most likely

07:52.472 --> 07:53.472
to commit crime.

07:54.612 --> 07:57.269
Already several
countries have begun

07:57.304 --> 07:59.099
implementing this program,

07:59.133 --> 08:02.620
which is encouraging other
countries to follow suit.

08:02.654 --> 08:06.451
The U.N. meets today calling
for complice in implementing

08:06.486 --> 08:07.659
this new idea globally.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.448
- How can they do this to us?

08:38.482 --> 08:40.554
- Isn't it a breech of
our amendment rights?

08:40.589 --> 08:42.522
- What, do you have
something to hide?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.696
- I don't want this to
determine my future.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.318
- Emma.

08:48.424 --> 08:49.424
What do you think?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.311
- They're just going
to arrest people

09:13.345 --> 09:15.140
who have broken no law.

09:15.175 --> 09:16.175
- But they will.

09:17.418 --> 09:20.145
- You're talking in
potentials to commit crime.

09:25.944 --> 09:28.429
And preventing something
before it's committed

09:28.464 --> 09:31.018
is just a fundamental
paradox to the whole system.

09:39.026 --> 09:41.408
- This ball has never
fallen to the ground.

09:41.442 --> 09:43.962
Or in theory,
committed no crime.

09:45.654 --> 09:50.590
Lexi, if I drop this,
will it hit the ground?

09:52.039 --> 09:55.111
- If you catch it, will you
even know if it was going to?

09:55.146 --> 09:56.734
- Whatever the need
to catch something

09:56.768 --> 09:57.838
if it wasn't falling?

10:01.186 --> 10:03.982
- Yeah, but the ball wasn't
acting on its own though,

10:04.017 --> 10:07.261
professor, you dropped it,
and you chose to drop it.

10:07.296 --> 10:08.618
Just as you made
the first two fall,

10:08.642 --> 10:11.265
you chose to act on the third.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.026
You proved that we
have the ability

10:13.060 --> 10:15.235
to either act or
abstain from any action,

10:15.269 --> 10:17.513
even the action of
acting to arrest someone

10:17.547 --> 10:20.171
who has really
committed no crime,

10:20.205 --> 10:23.623
but there's a certain genome,
or not arresting them.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.383
- I wonder, Lexi,

10:25.417 --> 10:27.316
when the time comes to
have your blood tested,

10:27.350 --> 10:29.076
what do you think
your blood will say?

10:29.111 --> 10:31.700
Can you choose something that
has been in your bloodline?

10:32.873 --> 10:35.738
If you turn to page
482 in your textbook.

10:39.121 --> 10:40.754
- I've rendered
conventional security strategies

10:40.778 --> 10:45.161
irrelevant, ineffectual.

10:45.196 --> 10:46.335
We have to evolve.

10:46.369 --> 10:47.854
- Guys, please.

10:47.888 --> 10:51.685
- And I believe the E.U.
President Turel's proposal

10:51.720 --> 10:53.756
and Dr. Bali's research.

10:53.791 --> 10:55.931
- Well what
happens is a lot of people

10:55.965 --> 10:57.518
who decided to leave early,

10:57.553 --> 10:59.635
a lot of people have left, a
lot of folks have gone west,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.143
gone north,

11:01.177 --> 11:02.707
a lot of people have gone to
relatives', friends' houses

11:02.731 --> 11:03.870
where they feel safer.

11:03.904 --> 11:06.320
So at this point right
now, we believe--

11:06.355 --> 11:08.150
- Can highlight
the best in people,

11:08.184 --> 11:10.014
it can also bring out the worst.

11:10.048 --> 11:11.394
- Good
morning, Natalie.

11:11.429 --> 11:13.062
Even with all of our
television lights set up here,

11:13.086 --> 11:16.054
three gentlemen just climbed
into the broken window.

11:16.089 --> 11:17.780
- But the forfeiture
of a negligible amount

11:17.815 --> 11:21.059
of personal liberty is
a small price to pay

11:21.094 --> 11:23.475
for the promise of a
safer, less violent.

11:25.926 --> 11:26.926
- It's everywhere.

11:28.101 --> 11:29.274
- Yeah.

11:29.309 --> 11:31.483
So much for having a choice.

11:36.247 --> 11:37.766
- Dad?

11:37.800 --> 11:38.905
Are you watching this?

11:39.906 --> 11:40.906
Yeah, I know.

11:42.253 --> 11:43.668
All right, I'll be home soon.

12:09.798 --> 12:10.798
- Rachel?

12:11.834 --> 12:14.388
Are you okay, what
are you doing?

12:14.423 --> 12:15.711
- It's the end of
the world, guys.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.978
Turel's not after world peace,

12:18.013 --> 12:19.221
he's after world domination,

12:19.255 --> 12:22.500
and I'm gonna home
with my family.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.503
Try to find somewhere
away from this place.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.953
- Where will you go?

12:26.987 --> 12:28.955
Isn't the majority of
the world behind this?

12:28.989 --> 12:30.611
- I don't know, Lexi.

12:30.646 --> 12:32.130
There's no way Turel's
up to any good.

12:32.165 --> 12:34.132
We'll find somewhere.

12:35.478 --> 12:38.481
- Yeah, I don't fully
understand the science

12:38.516 --> 12:43.107
of blood mapping, but I don't
really see how it affects us.

12:43.141 --> 12:44.971
- You guys don't
have to come with me,

12:45.005 --> 12:46.489
but you're certainly welcome.

13:02.712 --> 13:05.232
- It's like the whole
world had gone insane.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.996
Looting an rioting.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.965
People were herded
like cattle into tents.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.348
Testing them for evil.

13:19.522 --> 13:22.491
Those with the genes were
marked and validated as pure.

13:23.457 --> 13:26.219
The others, the invalids.

13:27.703 --> 13:29.118
They weren't so lucky.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.743
- No, no, let me go!

13:33.778 --> 13:35.124
The machine is wrong!

13:35.159 --> 13:36.505
It's wrong!
- Settle down!

13:47.378 --> 13:48.931
- It's gonna
give me superpowers.

13:51.209 --> 13:52.590
- You nervous?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.834
- Kind of, yeah.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.491
- Yeah, I mean I like to
think I'm a good person,

13:57.526 --> 13:59.735
but I guess we'll find out.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.985
Who is texting you?

14:08.019 --> 14:08.986
- What?

14:09.020 --> 14:10.504
- Your phone, it
keeps going off.

14:14.025 --> 14:15.025
What is it?

14:15.993 --> 14:18.443
- My professors
wanna meet with me.

14:18.478 --> 14:19.478
- Which ones?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.000
- All of them.

14:29.178 --> 14:31.249
- I know, I know, but
something's just not right.

14:31.284 --> 14:32.526
I don't trust them.

14:33.493 --> 14:34.874
I haven't figured it out yet.

14:36.945 --> 14:40.949
The global blood mapping
program is ahead of schedule.

14:40.983 --> 14:42.088
Results are coming in.

14:43.434 --> 14:45.677
- I don't care about the
results of your stupid program.

14:45.712 --> 14:49.164
When I backed your
research, I had one goal.

14:54.031 --> 14:56.378
- No phones, please.
- Sorry.

14:59.760 --> 15:04.351
- This is gonna hurt
just a little bit, sweetie.

15:27.996 --> 15:28.858
- That's it?

15:28.893 --> 15:30.446
- That's it.

15:30.481 --> 15:31.481
Next.

15:34.795 --> 15:38.213
- Right this
way for the implant.

16:01.788 --> 16:06.551
- Lexi Jones, 22,
Morgantown, West Virginia.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.830
100% match.

16:11.177 --> 16:12.178
- We found the heir?

16:13.179 --> 16:14.387
- Looks like it.

16:16.976 --> 16:17.976
- It's time.

16:19.668 --> 16:20.876
- What about him?

16:20.910 --> 16:22.326
- Kill him.

16:24.121 --> 16:26.054
- No, come on.

16:27.676 --> 16:30.196
Wait.

16:34.062 --> 16:35.270
- What now?

16:35.304 --> 16:38.549
- I'm not sure, this has
never happened before.

16:38.583 --> 16:39.860
- What happened?

16:39.895 --> 16:41.897
- The power went out.

16:41.931 --> 16:43.623
- We can't
get the implant?

16:45.832 --> 16:47.282
- Here, take this,

16:47.316 --> 16:50.216
and if anyone asks you if
you've received the implant,

16:50.250 --> 16:51.803
just show them these
serial numbers,

16:51.838 --> 16:54.082
and it should work the same way.

16:54.116 --> 16:56.118
Come back in the next few days,

16:56.153 --> 16:57.593
and we'll get this
figured out, okay?

17:05.645 --> 17:06.922
- Hi, Dr. Stewart.

17:06.955 --> 17:09.028
Sorry it took so long
to get back to you.

17:10.512 --> 17:11.823
You texted about meeting?

17:15.205 --> 17:16.205
You didn't?

17:18.347 --> 17:20.315
Okay, sorry to bother you, bye.

17:22.351 --> 17:24.457
He didn't text me about meeting.

17:24.491 --> 17:25.768
- That's weird.

17:25.803 --> 17:27.632
Try the others.

17:49.723 --> 17:51.000
Same thing?

17:51.035 --> 17:52.450
- Yeah.

17:52.485 --> 17:54.211
None of them reached out to me.

17:54.245 --> 17:56.765
- So who sent the text messages?

17:56.799 --> 17:57.800
Hey, watch it.

18:01.459 --> 18:02.978
- That's when I first met him.

18:04.117 --> 18:07.707
If I only knew how much
he'd change my life.

18:09.018 --> 18:10.227
Our lives.

18:13.437 --> 18:14.437
The world.

18:15.508 --> 18:16.543
- What a load of crap!

18:16.578 --> 18:19.408
It's all about greed.

18:19.443 --> 18:22.411
You valids just want
it all for yourselves.

18:22.446 --> 18:24.655
Who knows, she
could've led them here.

18:24.689 --> 18:28.659
They want nothing more than to
rid us off this dirty planet

18:28.693 --> 18:30.730
so that they can have it all.

18:31.765 --> 18:32.835
I say we kill her!

18:34.975 --> 18:36.149
- No.

18:36.184 --> 18:37.737
She's one of them.

18:37.771 --> 18:39.773
She can help us.

18:39.808 --> 18:40.878
She could get us food.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.224
- And you're gonna trust her?

18:42.259 --> 18:43.915
You're an invalid, why
would she help you?

18:43.950 --> 18:45.710
- Because I know
how to end this.

18:49.197 --> 18:50.543
You're all living a lie.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.030
I'm not who you think I am.

18:55.893 --> 18:57.653
And I didn't come here to pray.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.658
It's not about
what's in your blood,

19:02.693 --> 19:04.419
it's about what's in mind.

19:04.453 --> 19:05.844
- Well, let's see what's
in your blood, then.

19:05.868 --> 19:06.868
- Sable.

19:07.698 --> 19:10.079
- Whatever.

19:11.529 --> 19:12.737
I've gotta go feed the others.

19:12.772 --> 19:14.118
Come on, Torque, let's go.

19:15.430 --> 19:17.501
Eva, you watch her.

19:20.642 --> 19:23.162
Come on, let's get outta here.

19:33.620 --> 19:34.620
- What's your name?

19:36.796 --> 19:37.796
- Alexis.

19:39.039 --> 19:40.039
Lexi.

19:41.352 --> 19:42.353
- My name's Eva.

19:44.838 --> 19:46.875
Why do I feel like I know you?

19:50.085 --> 19:51.397
What is in your blood?

19:53.813 --> 19:55.711
- Something that
could save the world.

19:58.473 --> 19:59.473
Or end it.

21:08.474 --> 21:10.130
- Who is this?

21:10.165 --> 21:12.029
How did you get my number?

21:16.482 --> 21:18.035
- Lexi, you
have to trust me.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.486
Stay on the phone,
and I will get you out.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.281
- How do you know my name?

21:22.315 --> 21:24.317
- I've been
sent to protect you.

21:24.352 --> 21:26.595
Go to the door, and when
I tell you, open it.

21:26.630 --> 21:28.701
And move quickly down
the hall to the right.

21:28.735 --> 21:30.599
Emma is in the room
at the end of the hall.

21:30.634 --> 21:31.945
The door will be unlocked.

21:46.374 --> 21:48.790
Go to the door now, Lexi.

21:48.824 --> 21:49.825
- Who are you?

21:51.137 --> 21:53.337
- I'm your only hope of
getting out of this place alive.

21:56.729 --> 21:57.729
Go, Lexi.

22:14.298 --> 22:15.575
- My God.

22:15.610 --> 22:17.370
- My God, you're alive.

22:17.405 --> 22:18.785
I was so worried about you.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.615
- Are you okay, did
they hurt you, are you?

22:20.649 --> 22:23.859
- I'm fine, my head hurts
a little, but I'm fine.

22:23.894 --> 22:25.102
I think we were drugged.

22:27.207 --> 22:28.864
Who are you talking to?

22:28.899 --> 22:31.073
- I don't know, but I
think we can trust him.

22:33.490 --> 22:34.767
- Are you ready?

22:34.801 --> 22:36.147
- We have to go.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.844
- Go down the hallway
and into the living room.

22:42.878 --> 22:43.878
Lexi, stop.

22:45.709 --> 22:47.400
Don't go down the stairs.

22:57.445 --> 22:59.343
Turn back, the first
door on your left.

23:08.766 --> 23:10.009
Stop, Lexi.

23:10.043 --> 23:11.424
There's a man downstairs.

23:16.049 --> 23:17.049
Wait.

23:18.017 --> 23:19.846
When I tell you, go.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.711
- Ready?

23:22.746 --> 23:23.954
- Now, quickly.

23:27.613 --> 23:28.821
Hurry.
- Come on, hurry.

23:28.855 --> 23:30.685
- Into the woods.

23:35.690 --> 23:36.484
Lexi, they know you're missing.

23:36.518 --> 23:37.795
You need to move.

23:52.361 --> 23:53.361
Lexi, Emma!

23:54.881 --> 23:56.169
- I can't believe
you were out here.

23:56.193 --> 23:58.160
- Come with me if
you want to live.

23:58.195 --> 23:59.334
- Where are we going?

23:59.368 --> 24:00.928
- No time for questions,
you gotta move.

24:24.048 --> 24:25.705
Lexi, give me your hand.

24:25.740 --> 24:26.948
Take this.

24:26.982 --> 24:28.605
Keep your left hand
on the cave wall.

24:28.639 --> 24:29.882
It will lead you out.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.307
Once out, you will
see a small house

24:31.331 --> 24:32.988
in the center of a clearing.

24:33.023 --> 24:35.750
Run towards that house,
the door will be unlocked.

24:35.784 --> 24:38.062
Wait for me there, but
don't turn on any lights

24:38.097 --> 24:38.891
or make noise.

24:38.925 --> 24:39.925
Now go!

24:40.858 --> 24:42.584
- Wait, what about you?

24:42.619 --> 24:43.965
- There's no time, go now!

24:49.246 --> 24:54.113
- Left hand on the wall,
left hand on the wall.

24:54.147 --> 24:55.735
Left hand on the wall.

24:55.770 --> 24:58.738
Left hand on the wall, left
hand on the wall, left hand.

24:58.773 --> 25:00.405
Left hand on the wall,
left hand on the wall,

25:00.429 --> 25:02.949
left hand on the wall,
left hand on the wall,

25:02.984 --> 25:04.951
left hand on the wall.

25:04.986 --> 25:08.127
- Our Father, who art in Heaven.

25:08.161 --> 25:09.508
- What are you saying?

25:09.542 --> 25:11.371
- It's a prayer.

25:11.406 --> 25:12.787
I learned it when I was little.

25:12.821 --> 25:16.445
My parents told me whenever
I'm afraid, to pray.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.448
- Can I say it with you?

25:20.622 --> 25:22.866
- Of course, you know it, too?

25:22.900 --> 25:24.523
- Yeah, I think so.

25:26.421 --> 25:29.010
- Our Father.
- Who art in Heaven.

25:29.044 --> 25:31.633
Hallowed be thy name.

25:31.668 --> 25:34.118
- Thy kingdom come.
- Thy will be done.

25:34.153 --> 25:35.982
On Earth as it is in Heaven.

25:38.709 --> 25:40.469
- Where did they go?
- They can't go far.

25:40.504 --> 25:41.504
Keep searching!

25:47.097 --> 25:48.685
I thought I smelled a traitor.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.102
- Always a step
behind, old friend.

25:53.103 --> 25:54.103
- Where's the girl?

25:55.277 --> 25:57.970
- She's safe, and
far away from you.

25:58.004 --> 25:59.247
- Enough, Riley.

26:00.628 --> 26:02.802
You need to come back
to where you belong.

26:02.837 --> 26:04.252
- No.

26:04.286 --> 26:05.702
I'm nothing like you.

26:05.736 --> 26:08.463
- You can't change what you
are or what you've done.

26:10.430 --> 26:11.430
- You're wrong.

26:12.847 --> 26:14.538
- Samyaza will return.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.988
We know about the girl.

26:16.022 --> 26:20.648
And when we find her, it would
be wise to be on our side.

26:21.787 --> 26:23.443
- And do you know
who else will return?

26:23.478 --> 26:26.032
Someone more powerful
than Samyaza.

26:26.067 --> 26:27.827
And he will be no match for him.

26:27.862 --> 26:30.692
- You think he's gonna
forgive what we did that day?

26:30.727 --> 26:32.452
- He already has.

26:32.487 --> 26:34.662
It's never too late, Asael.

26:34.696 --> 26:36.905
He can forgive--
- Enough!

26:36.940 --> 26:38.976
Last chance.

26:39.011 --> 26:40.357
Give up the girl.

26:40.391 --> 26:41.391
- Never.

26:52.990 --> 26:55.061
- Emma, look!
- Thank God.

27:52.740 --> 27:53.740
Now what?

27:54.707 --> 27:55.881
- Now we wait.

27:59.332 --> 28:00.989
- Do you believe in God, Eva?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.580
- What does that
have to do with this?

28:06.995 --> 28:07.995
- Everything.

28:10.343 --> 28:12.829
- Do you mean
like, in this book?

28:13.761 --> 28:14.761
- Yes.

28:16.833 --> 28:17.833
- I don't know.

28:19.663 --> 28:20.802
I can't read.

28:21.665 --> 28:22.977
- I could teach you.

28:24.461 --> 28:26.118
- Why would you do that?

28:26.152 --> 28:27.913
- Because I wanna
be your friend.

28:28.948 --> 28:33.401
- But, you're one of them.

28:33.435 --> 28:35.092
Why would you help me?

28:35.127 --> 28:38.164
- Friends can come from
the strangest of places.

28:44.653 --> 28:45.551
- Lily Aiden.

28:45.585 --> 28:47.070
- Lily, it's Dusk.

28:47.104 --> 28:48.554
- What do you want?

28:48.588 --> 28:51.143
- Whoa, is that any
way to treat your best friend?

28:51.177 --> 28:51.937
- Adam.

28:51.971 --> 28:53.421
- Okay, okay.

28:53.455 --> 28:55.664
So I came across this blog
about the end time scenarios.

28:55.699 --> 28:58.806
It paints Danel as like the
Antichrist or false prophet.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.014
- I'm listening.

29:00.048 --> 29:01.567
- It has
some shocking photos

29:01.601 --> 29:03.811
that shows Danel's bodyguard
in several different photos

29:03.845 --> 29:06.158
all around the world,
all in different decades,

29:06.192 --> 29:07.469
even a few paintings,

29:07.504 --> 29:10.714
in which his likeness
is unquestionable.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.371
It's crazy.

29:12.405 --> 29:13.486
- That doesn't sound credible.

29:13.510 --> 29:14.753
What's the story?

29:15.615 --> 29:16.615
- Let her get away.

29:18.273 --> 29:19.965
I don't care.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.518
- Sir?

29:21.552 --> 29:22.657
- Yes.

29:22.691 --> 29:24.486
- They're ready for you now.

29:24.521 --> 29:26.143
- Thank you, I'll
be right there.

29:28.801 --> 29:32.356
- Find her, or
Asael will find you.

29:33.633 --> 29:35.232
- Then the
blood-mapping program is a guise

29:35.256 --> 29:38.431
by which Danel is helping this
man rise another to power.

29:38.466 --> 29:40.261
A supposed ancient
angel, his name--

29:40.295 --> 29:41.193
- I gotta go.

29:41.227 --> 29:42.366
Send that to me in an email.

29:48.856 --> 29:49.960
- We have a choice.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.482
Are we going to bow to the
violence and hatred of a few?

29:55.863 --> 29:59.936
Or will we band together,
sacrifice, and ensure

29:59.970 --> 30:02.110
that every man, woman,
and child on this planet

30:02.145 --> 30:04.526
is able to live free?

30:04.561 --> 30:07.115
For only when we have become one

30:07.150 --> 30:10.187
will we truly know our enemy.

30:10.222 --> 30:15.227
Only then can true
victory, freedom, and peace

30:15.952 --> 30:17.056
be at all possible.

30:22.786 --> 30:23.856
- Who are you?

30:23.891 --> 30:25.271
Who were those men?

30:25.306 --> 30:26.514
- Are you hungry?

30:27.929 --> 30:29.862
- Answer my question.

30:29.897 --> 30:31.484
- I will, but you
should eat first.

30:31.519 --> 30:32.865
It's a long story.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.419
- I don't food, I want answers.

30:35.454 --> 30:36.386
- Okay.

30:36.420 --> 30:37.905
I'll tell you what I can,

30:37.939 --> 30:41.011
but not so much that I
might endanger you further.

30:41.046 --> 30:42.668
- Blood mapping has enabled us

30:42.702 --> 30:45.844
to not only pinpoint
illegal activity,

30:45.878 --> 30:48.156
but also to prevent it.

30:49.571 --> 30:53.127
Cold cases have been solved
by finally having access

30:53.161 --> 30:55.646
to all its citizens' DNA.

30:55.681 --> 30:58.477
As a result, we have seen
crime drop significantly

30:58.511 --> 30:59.961
in many parts of the world,

31:01.135 --> 31:02.653
and I have every
reason to believe

31:02.688 --> 31:07.348
that as we continue to map,
we will see one day violence

31:08.487 --> 31:10.972
eliminated from our
planet entirely.

31:11.007 --> 31:12.249
- Mr. President!

31:12.284 --> 31:14.251
- There's a battle
that's being waged

31:14.286 --> 31:16.529
that's been going on
for a very long time.

31:16.564 --> 31:18.393
- Like a war on terror?

31:18.428 --> 31:20.706
- It's a different
kind of battle.

31:20.740 --> 31:22.190
- What do you mean?

31:22.225 --> 31:24.952
- It's a fight that's being
fought in a different reality.

31:24.986 --> 31:28.093
- A different reality?

31:28.127 --> 31:30.578
- Yes, on a spiritual plane.

31:30.612 --> 31:31.935
Although your world
has done a good job

31:31.959 --> 31:34.444
of making us seem
like ancient myth,

31:34.478 --> 31:36.964
I assure you, we are very real.

31:37.861 --> 31:39.656
- What about individual liberty?

31:39.690 --> 31:41.658
How do you respond to
the resistance of those

31:41.692 --> 31:43.971
who feel their freedom
is being infringed upon?

31:45.144 --> 31:46.673
- The balance between
individual liberty

31:46.697 --> 31:51.012
and collective peace,
it's a fragile one.

31:52.496 --> 31:56.845
Which is why we must act
now before it's too late.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.574
Before freedom is lost for
us and for our children.

32:01.609 --> 32:03.956
- Although I cannot be
seen most of the time,

32:03.991 --> 32:07.995
sometimes our war does
spill into your world.

32:08.029 --> 32:09.029
- What do you mean?

32:09.893 --> 32:11.308
- I'm one of the watchers.

32:11.343 --> 32:12.723
- The watchers?

32:12.758 --> 32:16.106
- One of the 200 sent to
protect and watch after humanity

32:16.141 --> 32:17.280
after the fall of Eden.

32:19.454 --> 32:22.181
- Eden, like the Garden of Eden?

32:22.216 --> 32:23.217
- Yes.

32:23.251 --> 32:24.873
After the serpent deceived Eve,

32:24.908 --> 32:26.875
we were sent to make sure

32:26.910 --> 32:29.119
the serpent didn't
tempt you again.

32:29.154 --> 32:30.983
- And you've been watching us.

32:31.018 --> 32:32.571
- I've been watching you, Lexi.

32:33.468 --> 32:35.194
- Me, why me?

32:35.229 --> 32:36.264
- To protect you.

32:36.299 --> 32:37.576
- From what?

32:37.610 --> 32:39.405
- Not from
what, but from whom.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.820
- Who then?

32:40.855 --> 32:41.855
- And old foe.

32:42.891 --> 32:44.686
Your family, Lexi,
has an adversary,

32:44.721 --> 32:46.895
a being trying to
eliminate your bloodline.

32:47.724 --> 32:49.450
- I don't have a family.

32:49.484 --> 32:51.038
- Why do
you think that is?

32:51.072 --> 32:54.248
- They died in a car
crash when I was little.

32:54.282 --> 32:55.974
- Did they?

32:56.008 --> 32:57.008
- What then?

32:58.769 --> 33:01.703
Are you saying that
they were murdered?

33:01.738 --> 33:02.738
- In a way.

33:03.498 --> 33:04.983
Do you believe in God, Lexi?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.126
- What does that
have to do with this?

33:10.160 --> 33:11.644
- Everything.

33:11.679 --> 33:14.026
- And you think you
can accomplish this?

33:14.061 --> 33:15.614
- The U.N. is voting right now

33:15.648 --> 33:17.823
to approve a
monumental resolution

33:17.857 --> 33:20.550
that will place immense pressure

33:20.584 --> 33:22.966
on criminals and terrorists.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.519
Food distribution
will be limited

33:24.554 --> 33:26.797
to participants in the
World Blood program.

33:28.109 --> 33:30.318
A special mark has been
placed upon all of those

33:30.353 --> 33:33.183
who have been mapped,
which, henceforth,

33:33.218 --> 33:35.944
will allow them to
purchase and possess food

33:35.979 --> 33:40.190
from grocery stores
and restaurants,

33:40.225 --> 33:41.709
but more importantly,

33:41.743 --> 33:45.678
it will keep the terrorists
and criminals among us at bay

33:45.713 --> 33:49.751
by depriving them of the
most basic human need.

33:50.787 --> 33:51.787
Food.

33:52.789 --> 33:54.584
- Okay, let
me get this straight,

33:54.618 --> 33:55.757
you're a watcher.
- Right.

33:55.792 --> 33:57.725
- People after me are watchers.

33:57.759 --> 33:59.209
- Right.

33:59.244 --> 34:00.566
- Because you're instructed
to protect my bloodline.

34:00.590 --> 34:02.040
- Right.
- Because of prophesy.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.455
- Right.

34:03.489 --> 34:06.699
- I don't think you're telling
us everything you know.

34:06.734 --> 34:08.494
- Does that bother you?

34:08.529 --> 34:09.771
- It bothers me

34:09.806 --> 34:12.498
when we get kidnapped in
the middle of the night.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.880
It bothers me when we
have to run for our lives

34:14.914 --> 34:16.364
and have no idea why.

34:17.226 --> 34:18.677
Why should we trust you?

34:18.710 --> 34:21.335
How do we know it's not you
who's trying to kill us?

34:21.369 --> 34:23.853
How do we know this
isn't some sort of trap,

34:23.889 --> 34:25.097
trying to earn our trust

34:25.132 --> 34:27.719
before you deliver us
to the real threat?

34:27.755 --> 34:28.652
Who are you?

34:28.687 --> 34:30.033
What is your name?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.344
- Names can be very personal.

34:31.379 --> 34:33.554
We're not allowed to
talk about such things.

34:33.588 --> 34:35.038
- You aren't giving
us any details.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.453
- It's for your protection.

34:36.487 --> 34:37.661
- That's not good enough.

34:37.696 --> 34:39.007
- It's how it has to be.

34:39.042 --> 34:40.181
- Then we're leaving.

34:40.216 --> 34:42.873
- You can't leave,
it isn't safe.

34:42.908 --> 34:44.427
- Neither is staying
here with someone

34:44.460 --> 34:45.737
we know nothing about.

34:51.018 --> 34:52.676
- What is your name?

34:56.024 --> 34:58.751
- How can you assure us that
this program cannot be hacked

34:58.786 --> 35:00.443
for personal gain?

35:00.477 --> 35:05.344
- As I mentioned in my address
to the general assembly,

35:05.379 --> 35:06.977
there are some sacrifices
that must be made

35:07.001 --> 35:10.729
for a secure and
peaceful future.

35:10.763 --> 35:13.732
Law abiding citizens
have nothing to fear.

35:13.766 --> 35:16.804
It's the terrorists that
now have something to fear.

35:16.838 --> 35:19.289
Namely, starvation.

35:19.324 --> 35:20.704
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!

35:20.739 --> 35:21.957
- Mr. President, how is this--
- Mr. President.

35:21.981 --> 35:23.776
- No more questions
press, thank you.

35:23.811 --> 35:25.651
- Mr. President!
- How is this going to affect?

35:25.675 --> 35:27.677
- Mr. President!

35:30.197 --> 35:31.336
- My name is Riley.

35:32.406 --> 35:33.821
- And you knew my parents?

35:35.547 --> 35:36.962
- Yeah, I did.

35:36.996 --> 35:38.412
- When did this begin?

35:39.689 --> 35:41.863
- When the loophole was created.

35:41.898 --> 35:42.898
- Loophole?

35:43.762 --> 35:45.177
- Jesus Christ spilled his blood

35:45.212 --> 35:47.938
and freed humanity from
the curse of death.

35:47.973 --> 35:49.457
So to the spilled
blood of the traitor

35:49.492 --> 35:52.253
will free Samyaza from
his current bondage.

35:52.288 --> 35:54.600
If he is freed,
he'll start again,

35:54.635 --> 35:56.637
but this time, he'll
destroy everything.

35:58.535 --> 36:00.088
- So I'm a traitor.

36:00.123 --> 36:01.366
- No.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.677
- Why me?

36:04.369 --> 36:07.061
- Because of your
ancestor, Judas Iscariot.

36:14.448 --> 36:16.933
A long time ago, there
was a rebellion in Heaven.

36:19.936 --> 36:24.492
One of the angels, Lucifer,
decided he didn't need God,

36:26.253 --> 36:28.082
and that he should be in charge.

36:33.018 --> 36:35.814
Lucifer was thrown
out of Heaven by God.

36:41.544 --> 36:44.719
But not without
taking everything him.

36:54.626 --> 36:56.006
His heart bent for revenge.

36:58.630 --> 37:00.287
Lucifer found a
way to injure God.

37:10.297 --> 37:13.472
He found humanity.

37:21.169 --> 37:23.689
Lucifer tricked them,
and they disobeyed God.

37:33.181 --> 37:36.150
God had no choice but to
remove him from the garden,

37:36.184 --> 37:38.325
and even though they had
to leave that perfect place

37:38.359 --> 37:41.259
and endure the curses
God had put upon them,

37:41.293 --> 37:44.296
God still loved them and had a
plan to put an end to Lucifer

37:44.331 --> 37:45.435
through her bloodline.

37:48.887 --> 37:51.476
God knew the snake was
wicked and would try again,

37:51.510 --> 37:55.100
so he sent 200 angels to
look after and protect men.

38:07.768 --> 38:09.287
They were called the watchers.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.790
I watched as a war
unfolded around me.

38:29.824 --> 38:32.171
The children born became giants,

38:32.206 --> 38:33.656
men with incredible strength.

38:34.588 --> 38:35.830
What power they had.

38:37.038 --> 38:39.282
The race of men almost
completely wiped out,

38:39.317 --> 38:41.284
diluted by the watchers.

38:44.598 --> 38:46.772
- I will wipe
from the face of the Earth

38:46.807 --> 38:49.568
the human race
that I've created.

38:51.052 --> 38:55.988
And those who have betrayed
me shall be encased in stone

38:56.575 --> 38:57.575
for eternity.

39:06.792 --> 39:09.554
And the world will be
cleansed from the evil

39:09.588 --> 39:12.108
that has been brought upon it.

39:32.991 --> 39:34.958
- After the flood,
Samyaza was punished.

39:38.859 --> 39:41.309
Locked away and turned to
stone for his treachery

39:42.863 --> 39:45.590
until a later time when he
would face a final judgment.

39:51.354 --> 39:53.598
After the floodwaters
began to dissipate

39:53.632 --> 39:55.876
and the land began to appear,

39:55.910 --> 39:57.878
God sent his archangel Michael

39:57.912 --> 39:59.707
to bind all the
remaining watchers.

40:14.515 --> 40:15.689
- Riley.

40:18.139 --> 40:20.728
You must protect the bloodline.

40:25.802 --> 40:27.045
- God forgave me.

40:31.774 --> 40:34.742
Lucifer was able to
save one watcher, Asael.

40:42.025 --> 40:46.444
- There will be a
traitor who will kill my son.

40:52.726 --> 40:56.246
The death of my son will
repair what has been broken

40:56.281 --> 40:57.420
in the garden.

41:01.631 --> 41:05.911
His innocent blood will
cover the sins of humanity.

41:12.400 --> 41:17.405
And the blood of this traitor
can end the war of the fallen.

41:20.823 --> 41:23.170
It is the last of the line

41:23.204 --> 41:26.000
that is the key to their release

41:26.035 --> 41:28.520
or the end of their existence.

41:33.663 --> 41:34.940
- Asael is war.

41:43.086 --> 41:44.086
Disease.

41:59.965 --> 42:01.484
Religious conspiracy.

42:18.846 --> 42:20.503
- Sieg heil!

42:20.538 --> 42:21.711
Sieg heil!

42:21.746 --> 42:24.818
- We will stop at
nothing to find you.

42:38.866 --> 42:40.903
Asael will never give up.

42:42.801 --> 42:45.804
- And this blood mapping
program is all to find me, too?

42:45.839 --> 42:47.023
- Why do you think
you were taken

42:47.047 --> 42:48.566
the same day as
when you registered?

42:49.946 --> 42:52.570
- You sent those text messages
to keep me from going.

42:52.604 --> 42:54.502
My professors
wanna meet with me.

42:54.537 --> 42:56.021
- I did.

42:56.056 --> 42:58.576
And to stop the implant, which
they could use to track you.

43:01.475 --> 43:04.064
- Why is it you waited
until now to find me?

43:04.098 --> 43:05.859
- Asael can only use
the blood of the heir

43:05.893 --> 43:08.137
to release Samyaza
every 17 years.

43:09.414 --> 43:11.002
- 17 years.

43:11.036 --> 43:12.900
That's when my--
- That's right.

43:12.935 --> 43:15.938
17 years ago, your parents
died in a car crash.

43:15.972 --> 43:17.733
I pulled you from the
wreckage and hid you

43:17.767 --> 43:19.666
until the apex passed.

43:19.700 --> 43:22.461
Asael's had to wait another
17 years to find you.

43:24.843 --> 43:27.397
- Tell me about this.

43:28.951 --> 43:30.953
- The coin has a
protective seal in it.

43:30.987 --> 43:33.300
Asael can't find you
when you have it.

44:02.674 --> 44:05.401
- Laura, clear my schedule
and take the afternoon off.

44:05.435 --> 44:06.920
- Are you sure, sir?

44:06.954 --> 44:08.380
- Yes, I'll be in my
office the rest of the day.

44:08.404 --> 44:10.509
I've got some matters
I need to attend to.

45:11.260 --> 45:13.262
- Why can't you use a door?

45:13.296 --> 45:15.436
I will never get used to that.

45:15.471 --> 45:16.714
- Has she been found?

45:17.991 --> 45:21.097
- We have men working
on finding her.

45:21.132 --> 45:23.997
- You understand the
urgency of this, I assume.

45:24.031 --> 45:26.585
- I know, I just need
a little more time.

45:27.794 --> 45:29.968
- The girl should be
your primary focus.

45:30.003 --> 45:33.523
- I still have an office to
run, in case you've forgotten.

45:33.558 --> 45:36.181
- We are sympathetic to
your own personal agenda,

45:36.216 --> 45:39.771
but you must not forget how
you came to be in the position

45:39.806 --> 45:42.049
in which you now find yourself.

45:42.084 --> 45:45.397
Would not go well for you,
should you forget your true task.

45:46.605 --> 45:48.676
If we don't release
Samyaza at the apex,

45:48.711 --> 45:51.369
your office will diminish
under the reality

45:51.403 --> 45:54.199
that Dr. Bali's
research stands on.

45:54.234 --> 45:55.234
- I know.

45:56.823 --> 46:01.103
- I think it's time to take
care of this ourselves.

46:01.137 --> 46:02.137
- Hey!

47:47.140 --> 47:48.589
- Dr. Bali's office.

47:48.624 --> 47:50.729
- Hi, this is Lillian Aiden
from the New York Times.

47:50.764 --> 47:51.592
- Yes, hi.

47:51.627 --> 47:53.491
- Yep, hi.

47:53.525 --> 47:56.183
I was wondering if I could
set up a meeting with Dr. Bali

47:56.218 --> 47:58.910
regarding his research
on the Hamarano strand.

47:58.945 --> 48:00.025
- Hold for
one moment, please.

48:00.049 --> 48:01.049
- Sure.

48:03.121 --> 48:04.674
Lily.

48:05.537 --> 48:06.953
- Yeah?

48:06.987 --> 48:08.516
- Where are you on the coverage
of today's press conference?

48:08.540 --> 48:10.025
I wanna run that
story by tonight.

48:10.059 --> 48:11.543
- Yeah, I'm almost done.

48:12.682 --> 48:13.891
- Lily.

48:13.925 --> 48:15.823
- Sebastian.

48:15.858 --> 48:17.860
- Don't you go
rogue on me again.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.793
You lost your chance at
investigative journalism

48:19.827 --> 48:21.243
after the Greenbrier incident.

48:21.277 --> 48:24.280
- Hey, that wasn't my
fault and you know it.

48:24.315 --> 48:25.937
I had a real story that time.

48:25.972 --> 48:29.009
- You had conjecture
and personal bias, Lily.

48:29.044 --> 48:31.218
I mean it, Lily.

48:31.253 --> 48:32.599
Write the story from today.

48:32.633 --> 48:34.842
Don't screw it up, this
is your last chance.

48:39.744 --> 48:40.538
- Ma'am?

48:40.572 --> 48:41.470
- Yes.

48:41.504 --> 48:42.678
- Lillian, I'm sorry,

48:42.712 --> 48:45.129
Dr. Bali isn't answering
his phone right now.

48:45.163 --> 48:48.891
- Do you have his cell number
where I could reach him?

48:48.926 --> 48:51.894
- I'm sorry, you'll
have to call back another time.

50:56.363 --> 51:01.265
- Dr. Bali?

51:02.887 --> 51:03.887
Dr. Bali?

51:20.284 --> 51:21.284
Okay.

51:27.739 --> 51:28.739
Okay.

52:28.317 --> 52:29.317
Hello?

53:02.351 --> 53:03.351
Lexi?

53:05.423 --> 53:06.423
Emma?

53:19.679 --> 53:23.303
Come on, come on,
come on, pick up!

53:23.338 --> 53:27.583
- Good goin' guys.

53:30.793 --> 53:33.382
- Come on, pick up, pick it up.

53:34.590 --> 53:36.109
- Come on, come on, come on.

53:36.143 --> 53:38.353
It's right there,
to your left, dude.

53:38.387 --> 53:40.562
There you go, there it is.

53:44.013 --> 53:45.877
Come on guys,
we're almost there.

53:48.121 --> 53:50.261
Ha, nice one.

53:51.607 --> 53:53.782
Victory tastes so great.

53:53.816 --> 53:56.992
Lily, what's up?

53:57.026 --> 53:59.684
- Adam, you were right.
- I was?

53:59.719 --> 54:01.514
I mean yeah, of course I was.

54:01.548 --> 54:02.342
- Where are you?

54:02.377 --> 54:04.413
- I'm at the house.

54:04.448 --> 54:07.209
- Okay, don't
leave, I'm almost there.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.244
- All right.

54:10.281 --> 54:12.559
All right, let's go again.

54:14.699 --> 54:17.702
- So you're saying all
of the world's wars

54:17.737 --> 54:22.742
are because of Lexi's family
and Asael trying to find them?

54:23.674 --> 54:25.262
- I am.

54:25.296 --> 54:26.711
- I think you're full of it.

54:29.024 --> 54:30.415
- It's not something
people in your day and age

54:30.439 --> 54:32.096
accept very often.

54:32.130 --> 54:33.580
- Come on, Lexi, let's go.

54:34.995 --> 54:36.273
- I think I'm gonna stay.

54:37.515 --> 54:38.585
- What?

54:38.620 --> 54:40.138
Are you crazy?

54:40.173 --> 54:42.555
All this talk of angels
and traitor's blood?

54:43.452 --> 54:44.452
- I believe him.

54:45.454 --> 54:48.112
- This isn't like
your video games

54:48.146 --> 54:51.080
where you're the hero and
everything works out fine.

54:51.115 --> 54:53.773
This is real life,
Lexi, and your books,

54:53.807 --> 54:55.671
when the heroes run
off into the sunset,

54:55.706 --> 54:57.742
the sunset doesn't end.

54:57.777 --> 55:01.505
Newsflash, sunsets, though
beautiful for a time

55:01.539 --> 55:03.852
turn into dark, cold nights.

55:06.717 --> 55:11.722
Supposing this is all real,
what happens if they catch her?

55:12.895 --> 55:14.656
- They will place
her on an altar,

55:14.690 --> 55:17.590
drain her blood, and
transfuse it into Samyaza.

55:18.798 --> 55:21.421
- Why do you believe that?

55:21.456 --> 55:24.528
- You can't make it
up, it has to be real.

55:24.562 --> 55:26.944
- You can't make this stuff up?

55:26.978 --> 55:28.117
Are you kidding?

55:28.152 --> 55:29.671
There are whole
sections of bookstores

55:29.705 --> 55:32.398
that have been dedicated
that have been made up,

55:32.432 --> 55:34.158
just like this.

55:34.192 --> 55:36.263
Don't confuse your
desire to be relevant

55:36.298 --> 55:37.403
with what is fact.

55:38.265 --> 55:39.163
- Emma.

55:39.197 --> 55:41.268
- No, Lexi, I'm leaving.

55:41.303 --> 55:44.271
He's insane and you're
insane for believing him.

55:44.306 --> 55:45.445
- Emma, wait.

55:52.245 --> 55:53.245
- Come with me.

55:55.282 --> 55:56.282
- I can't.

55:58.044 --> 55:59.044
I'm sorry.

56:00.322 --> 56:02.117
Please, be safe out there.

56:20.377 --> 56:21.377
- Lexi?

56:33.079 --> 56:36.323
- Well, I went to that blog
you were talking about,

56:36.358 --> 56:37.818
I wasn't sure if anything you
gave me would be relevant,

56:37.842 --> 56:40.397
but I went out to
Dr. Bali's lab.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.539
I found this.

56:44.573 --> 56:46.368
- And he just gave it to you?

56:46.403 --> 56:48.957
- He was dead.

56:48.991 --> 56:51.131
- That's complicated.

56:53.893 --> 56:56.274
- This isn't a peaceful
blood-mapping system

56:56.309 --> 56:57.586
to rid the world of violence.

56:57.621 --> 56:59.416
Danel is trying to
release the watchers

56:59.450 --> 57:02.315
and make himself king.

57:02.349 --> 57:05.491
Worse yet, I think
he might succeed.

57:06.871 --> 57:08.321
I went to the girls' apartment,

57:08.355 --> 57:09.988
and it looked like there'd
been a huge struggle.

57:10.012 --> 57:12.221
I think they've been kidnapped.

57:12.256 --> 57:13.878
- Did you go to the police?

57:13.913 --> 57:15.639
- And tell them, what?

57:15.673 --> 57:17.882
That two girls have been
kidnapped to be sacrificed

57:17.917 --> 57:19.712
to a release a race
of angels on Earth

57:19.746 --> 57:22.680
in order to bring
about the apocalypse?

57:22.715 --> 57:25.959
- You have a point.

57:25.994 --> 57:27.133
- What are you doing?

57:27.167 --> 57:28.790
- Well, if what
you're saying is true,

57:28.824 --> 57:33.415
then this guy is also this guy.

57:36.245 --> 57:37.488
- What does that mean?

57:37.523 --> 57:39.352
- It means they'll be
hunting for the heir.

57:39.386 --> 57:41.941
- Wait, where is all
this taking place?

57:41.975 --> 57:44.322
- It'll be on the hill where
Samyaza was encased in stone,

57:44.357 --> 57:46.980
and there'll be sacrificing
them on the Apex.

57:47.015 --> 57:48.395
- When is that?

57:48.430 --> 57:50.397
- A little under
a day and a half.

57:51.364 --> 57:52.814
- Can he be stopped?

57:52.848 --> 57:56.334
- Well, legend has it that
Asael keeps a dagger on him

57:56.369 --> 57:59.476
crafted from the silver Judas
was paid to betray Jesus.

57:59.510 --> 58:00.684
Other theories say

58:00.718 --> 58:02.617
that it's the blade from
the spear of destiny.

58:02.651 --> 58:04.135
- Spear of destiny?

58:04.170 --> 58:06.759
- İt's the blade that
was used to pierce Jesus

58:06.793 --> 58:08.726
to see if he was actually dead.

58:08.761 --> 58:10.659
- So, is this
blade important?

58:10.694 --> 58:12.178
- Super important.

58:12.212 --> 58:14.491
It's said that it can be
used to kill the watchers,

58:14.525 --> 58:16.907
but it's also the blade that
has to be used in the sacrifice

58:16.941 --> 58:18.460
to release the watchers.

58:18.495 --> 58:21.152
And once the bloodline
of Judas frees Samyaza,

58:21.187 --> 58:24.121
the dagger can be used
to free his chiefs also.

58:24.155 --> 58:24.949
- How many chiefs?

58:24.984 --> 58:27.573
- About 20 or so.

58:27.607 --> 58:32.267
- Okay, so once this Samyaza
guy and his chiefs are released

58:32.301 --> 58:34.027
then they will
have the power to?

58:34.062 --> 58:36.685
Destroy humanity forever.

58:38.549 --> 58:40.551
- So, you mentioned
I was the only thing

58:40.586 --> 58:43.485
that could free
Samyaza or destroy him.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.417
- That's right.

58:44.451 --> 58:46.730
- I know what frees Samyaza.

58:46.764 --> 58:47.558
- Your sacrifice.

58:47.593 --> 58:49.318
- Yeah, I got that.

58:49.353 --> 58:51.079
What kills him?

58:52.667 --> 58:54.082
- You don't have to do this.

58:55.670 --> 58:57.672
- What's my other option?

58:57.706 --> 59:00.709
Constantly on the run, always
looking over my shoulder?

59:03.091 --> 59:04.886
- It'll all be over soon.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.473
You'll close the loophole,

59:06.508 --> 59:07.727
and you and the rest
of your family line

59:07.751 --> 59:08.786
will be able to rest.

59:11.133 --> 59:14.136
There's a dagger made of
highly-polished, hardened steel,

59:14.171 --> 59:15.759
inlayed with silver.

59:15.793 --> 59:17.484
Asael will have it on his hip.

59:17.519 --> 59:19.348
First, he will test your blood

59:19.383 --> 59:21.419
to make sure I'm not
trying to trick him.

59:22.697 --> 59:24.112
You won't be able to see well,

59:24.146 --> 59:27.391
he'll strap you down in a
chair so that you won't escape.

59:27.425 --> 59:29.980
- How will I take
the dagger, then?

59:30.014 --> 59:31.671
- You'll be able to get close

59:31.706 --> 59:33.639
right before he sacrifices you.

59:34.812 --> 59:38.195
- It seems like we're
cutting it really close.

59:38.229 --> 59:39.817
- I'll be watching
the whole time.

59:40.749 --> 59:42.268
Once one of your hands is free,

59:42.302 --> 59:45.064
he'll be able to dodge
the descent of the dagger.

59:45.098 --> 59:48.964
Take it from him and plunge it
into the statue behind Asael.

59:50.656 --> 59:53.417
- What's gonna keep
Asael from stopping me?

59:53.451 --> 59:54.660
- That's where I come in.

59:55.626 --> 59:58.629
- So, how are we
gonna get there?

59:58.664 --> 01:00:00.148
- Hold onto me.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.431
Are you ready?

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.711
- And you said you
could end all of this?

01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:14.679
- Yes.

01:00:17.544 --> 01:00:20.824
- I don't wanna live
like this anymore.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.557
I see pictures in these books.

01:00:31.835 --> 01:00:34.596
It's nothing like my world.

01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:42.190
I wanna go there.

01:00:48.472 --> 01:00:49.680
Will you take me there?

01:00:51.406 --> 01:00:56.376
- Those pictures are real,
and I will take you there.

01:00:59.207 --> 01:01:00.207
I promise.

01:01:08.043 --> 01:01:09.044
What about Sable?

01:01:12.185 --> 01:01:13.462
- Don't worry about her.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.948
She's like my big sister.

01:01:17.397 --> 01:01:21.298
She's raised me ever since
they found me as a baby.

01:01:23.749 --> 01:01:26.855
These people, this place.

01:01:28.754 --> 01:01:32.689
They're my family, my life.

01:01:35.519 --> 01:01:36.658
My memories.

01:01:39.212 --> 01:01:41.387
But I still feel so empty.

01:01:43.803 --> 01:01:45.667
Like I don't really
know who I am.

01:01:57.541 --> 01:02:02.132
So what happened to
your roommate, Emma?

01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:04.789
- Yes.

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:07.101
Emma.

01:02:10.899 --> 01:02:12.625
- First time's
always the hardest.

01:02:22.566 --> 01:02:24.464
- The heir, at long last.

01:02:26.984 --> 01:02:28.227
- What are you doing?

01:02:32.887 --> 01:02:33.887
- Run this.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.691
I don't wanna take any chances.

01:02:44.726 --> 01:02:46.763
I wanna make sure we
have the right girl.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:56.772
- No need.

01:02:57.463 --> 01:02:59.085
This isn't Lexi.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120
- What?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.055
You brought me the wrong girl!

01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:08.025
- And who are you?

01:03:13.686 --> 01:03:14.686
- Impossible!

01:03:15.688 --> 01:03:17.207
- Run it again.

01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:39.263
- How could this be?

01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:40.747
- Sir.

01:03:40.782 --> 01:03:42.062
There's someone here to see you.

01:03:42.094 --> 01:03:43.267
- Not now.

01:03:43.302 --> 01:03:44.682
- It's Riley, sir.

01:03:44.717 --> 01:03:46.132
He says he has the heir.

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:48.514
- This is just getting more
exciting by the minute.

01:03:50.136 --> 01:03:51.620
- Adam, it's a rental.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.040
- Whoa, is this it?

01:03:58.075 --> 01:04:00.181
- Looks like it.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.200
- Don't be afraid.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.035
- Well, well.

01:04:28.174 --> 01:04:30.314
What is this present
that you've brought me?

01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:32.144
- I've brought you the heir.

01:04:32.178 --> 01:04:33.352
I'm ready to end this.

01:04:34.629 --> 01:04:37.735
- Do you remember
your mission from God?

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:41.498
I'm sure he wouldn't be
very happy about this.

01:04:41.532 --> 01:04:42.740
- I'm done.

01:04:42.775 --> 01:04:44.294
I wanna end this
once and for all.

01:04:44.328 --> 01:04:46.261
In exchange for
her, I want back in,

01:04:46.296 --> 01:04:48.919
in a position of power
when Samyaza is released.

01:04:48.954 --> 01:04:50.679
- It sounds very tempting.

01:04:53.717 --> 01:04:57.997
But as it turns out, I
don't need little Lexi.

01:04:59.067 --> 01:05:00.241
Or you for that matter.

01:05:03.623 --> 01:05:05.384
Put him in the cellar!

01:05:07.006 --> 01:05:07.834
- What about the girl?

01:05:07.869 --> 01:05:08.663
We have her twin.

01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:09.940
- Her, too.

01:05:09.975 --> 01:05:11.459
We may need to use her later.

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:19.743
- That guy just got murdered.

01:05:19.777 --> 01:05:20.996
- We have to get
her out of there.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.780
- Do I look like Rambo to you?

01:05:22.815 --> 01:05:23.989
- Shh!

01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:25.276
- We're out-armed
and outnumbered!

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.660
- Shh, we need to
get closer, here.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.895
Come on, come on!

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.517
There they are.

01:05:40.281 --> 01:05:41.316
What are they doing?

01:05:41.351 --> 01:05:42.973
- I don't know.

01:05:43.008 --> 01:05:44.492
- Well.

01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:46.459
- Look.

01:05:46.494 --> 01:05:47.598
- Go, go, go.

01:05:51.878 --> 01:05:54.467
My gosh, get down, get down.

01:05:56.573 --> 01:05:57.919
Go, go that way.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:03.200
- They--
- Shh, quiet!

01:06:03.235 --> 01:06:04.615
There might still
be guards around.

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:07.825
- But they just disappeared,
did you not see it?

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:09.034
- Yes, I saw it.

01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:11.277
- They were there,
and now they're not.

01:06:11.312 --> 01:06:12.589
- Yeah, Adam, I saw.

01:06:12.623 --> 01:06:14.867
Now, help me find a way in.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:23.358
- What did she mean by my twin?

01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:24.359
I don't have a sister.

01:06:24.394 --> 01:06:26.189
- I'm fine, by the way.

01:06:26.223 --> 01:06:28.260
It's not like I was
just stabbed out there.

01:06:28.294 --> 01:06:29.882
- Answer the question.

01:06:30.883 --> 01:06:33.161
- What do you wanna know, Lexi?

01:06:33.196 --> 01:06:36.854
You were adopted and
raised as an only child,

01:06:36.889 --> 01:06:38.960
but there was another
baby in the car

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.444
the night of the accident.

01:06:40.479 --> 01:06:41.549
- What happened?

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:45.587
- Asael crashed another
car into your parents.

01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:54.148
- My parents?

01:06:54.182 --> 01:06:56.322
- They died on impact.

01:07:24.143 --> 01:07:26.283
- So you just left my
sister to die, then.

01:07:26.318 --> 01:07:28.251
- What was I supposed to do?

01:07:28.285 --> 01:07:29.459
Asael was coming,

01:07:29.493 --> 01:07:31.426
and you were the one
who needed to be saved.

01:07:32.427 --> 01:07:33.704
- What happened to her?

01:07:34.912 --> 01:07:36.707
- Police found her,

01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:39.952
and she was raised in
a nice, happy home.

01:07:39.986 --> 01:07:41.781
- Where has she been
all of these years?

01:07:41.816 --> 01:07:44.819
- You've been living with her
for the better part of a year.

01:07:46.545 --> 01:07:47.856
- Emma?

01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:50.963
- Let go of me!
- Don't be afraid.

01:07:50.997 --> 01:07:52.102
- Yeah.

01:07:52.137 --> 01:07:55.209
- Why didn't you tell us that?

01:07:55.243 --> 01:07:56.417
- There was no point!

01:07:58.798 --> 01:08:00.880
She didn't believe anything
else of what I told you two.

01:08:00.904 --> 01:08:02.664
Why would knowing
you two are related

01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:03.907
have made any difference?

01:08:05.909 --> 01:08:08.291
- You could've done something.

01:08:08.325 --> 01:08:10.500
- Your life was the
only one that mattered.

01:08:12.018 --> 01:08:14.814
- My life was the only
one that mattered?

01:08:15.677 --> 01:08:16.782
Her life matters, too!

01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:22.167
We're stuck in a stupid room,

01:08:22.201 --> 01:08:25.515
and she's out there,
and she's about to die!

01:08:25.549 --> 01:08:28.587
This is all your fault.

01:08:33.316 --> 01:08:34.317
- Are you okay?

01:08:34.350 --> 01:08:35.662
Wait, how are you okay?

01:08:35.697 --> 01:08:36.904
- I saw him stab you.

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:38.769
- Adam, I thought
you said that knife

01:08:38.804 --> 01:08:40.046
would kill the watchers.

01:08:40.081 --> 01:08:41.255
- I hope it does.

01:08:41.288 --> 01:08:42.404
- There's not even
a hole in his shirt.

01:08:42.428 --> 01:08:43.912
- It's not that type of dagger.

01:08:43.947 --> 01:08:45.154
- It's made him mortal.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:48.640
- You must be Lexi, so
they took your sister,

01:08:48.676 --> 01:08:50.618
and if we're gonna get there
before they release Samyaza,

01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:51.850
we gotta go now.

01:08:51.886 --> 01:08:53.174
- Okay, let's go, do
your whooshing thing.

01:08:53.198 --> 01:08:54.130
- I can't.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.578
I don't have any power anymore.

01:08:57.649 --> 01:08:59.444
- Okay, how far
away is this place?

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:00.377
- About an hour.

01:09:00.412 --> 01:09:01.758
- What about the apex?

01:09:01.792 --> 01:09:03.000
- A little over an hour.

01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:04.805
- Okay, if we go now, we
can get there in time.

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:07.038
- Why are you helping us?

01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:09.455
- Well, global domination
by dark, angelic forces

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:10.904
where all life is destroyed

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:13.528
is pretty terrible sounding
to me, so we gotta go.

01:09:13.563 --> 01:09:14.529
- Go.
- We're gonna go now.

01:09:14.564 --> 01:09:15.564
- Come on.

01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:19.879
- So how did you
find out about all this?

01:09:19.913 --> 01:09:21.363
- I'm a journalist.

01:09:21.398 --> 01:09:25.229
I've been following Turel and
a his blood mapping program

01:09:25.264 --> 01:09:28.992
for a while, and I went to
visit Dr. Bali, and he was dead.

01:09:29.026 --> 01:09:32.029
- Dr., Dr. Bali, he's the
one who found the, the--

01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:34.238
- Hamarano strand.
- Yeah.

01:09:34.273 --> 01:09:35.654
- I don't know
what happened,

01:09:35.688 --> 01:09:38.553
but apparently he was
disposable once he found you.

01:09:38.587 --> 01:09:41.142
- So are we gonna
get there on time?

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.251
It's gonna be close.

01:09:47.734 --> 01:09:50.876
- So there's a chance the
sacrifice might not work.

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:51.910
- What?

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:56.744
- Between Emma and Lexi,
who was the second born?

01:09:56.778 --> 01:09:59.056
- Lexi, that's
why I grabbed her.

01:09:59.091 --> 01:10:02.508
- So the text talks
about the last blood,

01:10:02.543 --> 01:10:04.614
but I've been running
a debate forum

01:10:04.648 --> 01:10:06.098
since we got in the car,

01:10:06.132 --> 01:10:08.687
posed the question if it
was split between twins,

01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:12.000
would you need both bloods
or just the last born?

01:10:14.002 --> 01:10:15.383
- And?

01:10:15.418 --> 01:10:18.075
- Well, it's split.

01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:19.594
But the problem remains--

01:10:19.629 --> 01:10:22.735
- That in either of
those two scenarios,

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.807
Emma would die for nothing.

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.027
- Is it working?

01:10:40.995 --> 01:10:42.203
- I don't know.

01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:47.553
- Why isn't this working?

01:10:47.588 --> 01:10:49.106
- It must not be working.

01:10:49.141 --> 01:10:51.177
- Guys, we gotta go now.

01:10:51.212 --> 01:10:53.732
- I'll head down this
way and distract 'em.

01:10:53.766 --> 01:10:56.562
You three go up there,
get him off the altar.

01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:59.876
- Riley, you're mortal
now, he'll kill you.

01:11:01.153 --> 01:11:02.153
- I know.

01:11:03.569 --> 01:11:06.227
- You'd risk your life for us?

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.125
- I messed up once.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.611
I won't make that
same mistake again.

01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:16.858
Go, I won't be able to
distract them very long.

01:11:17.997 --> 01:11:18.997
Lexi, wait.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:26.040
I'm so sorry about everything.

01:11:30.389 --> 01:11:31.839
- Why'd he do that?

01:11:31.873 --> 01:11:33.153
Why'd he do that?
- I don't know.

01:11:33.185 --> 01:11:34.185
- Go.

01:11:35.636 --> 01:11:36.636
Go!

01:11:45.577 --> 01:11:47.233
The girl's blood
didn't work, did it?

01:11:48.545 --> 01:11:50.098
- This is gonna be fun.

01:12:00.419 --> 01:12:05.390
- Lexi!

01:12:16.021 --> 01:12:19.921
- No!

01:12:23.891 --> 01:12:25.271
- You're ruining everything!

01:12:25.306 --> 01:12:28.136
No!

01:12:30.518 --> 01:12:33.176
- Lexi, the statue!

01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:55.612
- We were too late.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.443
We couldn't save her.

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:03.758
Emma's blood freed Samyaza
from the tomb, but.

01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:10.938
He was still weak,
not at full strength.

01:13:13.354 --> 01:13:16.253
For that, they needed my blood.

01:13:17.358 --> 01:13:19.084
The last of the Judas bloodline.

01:13:21.017 --> 01:13:26.022
Emma gave her life so
that I could have mine.

01:13:27.955 --> 01:13:32.856
- But, how have they not
found you after all this time?

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:37.482
- Did you hear
that noise outside?

01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:41.140
The cicadas.

01:13:44.178 --> 01:13:46.594
They know when there's an
imbalance in the Earth.

01:13:47.906 --> 01:13:49.942
They're warning us.

01:13:50.805 --> 01:13:52.117
The apex is coming.

01:13:53.498 --> 01:13:54.982
Every 17 years.

01:13:56.397 --> 01:13:58.986
That's when Riley, my
guardian angel, appears.

01:13:59.952 --> 01:14:00.952
To protect me.

01:14:07.063 --> 01:14:11.688
17 years ago, they came
for me again, Riley and I.

01:14:14.035 --> 01:14:15.140
We made a plan.

01:14:21.284 --> 01:14:27.186
This coin has kept me
hidden all these years.

01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.604
I want you to have it.

01:14:32.053 --> 01:14:33.053
- Why me?

01:14:34.297 --> 01:14:36.299
- Because I don't
need it anymore.

01:14:38.922 --> 01:14:40.786
- But they'll know
where you are.

01:14:40.821 --> 01:14:41.821
- I know.

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:47.206
- And what's going on here?

01:14:47.241 --> 01:14:48.345
Bribery?

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.107
- No, you don't understand!

01:14:51.141 --> 01:14:52.764
Give her the coin!

01:14:56.008 --> 01:14:57.423
- Sable?

01:14:57.458 --> 01:14:59.771
You better come quick, I
think we have a, visitor.

01:15:08.849 --> 01:15:09.988
See?

01:15:10.022 --> 01:15:11.022
I told you.

01:15:24.278 --> 01:15:27.281
- Hello, Alexis,
did you miss me?

01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:30.836
It was just a matter of time.

01:15:30.871 --> 01:15:34.599
Now, we can make
this quick and easy,

01:15:34.633 --> 01:15:39.638
or we can make this
slow and painful.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:42.260
- No.

01:15:43.469 --> 01:15:44.469
I'm ready.

01:15:56.172 --> 01:15:57.518
I'm tired of running.

01:15:58.795 --> 01:16:01.039
You killed my entire family,

01:16:02.212 --> 01:16:04.870
destroyed everything
I have ever loved.

01:16:06.976 --> 01:16:08.529
I have nothing left.

01:16:10.496 --> 01:16:13.396
- How long I have
waited for this moment!

01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:16.123
The coin couldn't
protect you forever.

01:16:16.157 --> 01:16:20.576
To finally be complete, to
finally fulfill my destiny!

01:16:21.956 --> 01:16:25.615
Though you are the last,
your bloodline will live on

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:28.860
for eternity in me.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:31.725
- Then let's do this.

01:16:36.902 --> 01:16:38.076
Glad you could make it.

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:40.216
- I wouldn't
miss this for the world.

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:43.944
- Riley!

01:16:48.086 --> 01:16:50.744
I thought Asael had
taken care of you.

01:16:50.778 --> 01:16:53.574
- Your henchmen are
getting sloppy, Sammy.

01:17:03.239 --> 01:17:06.173
That dagger may have
taken my powers,

01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:08.762
but it didn't take
my immortality.

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:11.834
- Then i shall take
your immortality.

01:17:13.836 --> 01:17:15.631
And then I will take your life.

01:19:07.225 --> 01:19:08.191
- You should've
taken Asael's offer

01:19:08.226 --> 01:19:09.745
when you had the chance, Riley.

01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:13.231
- It didn't seem like
that good of an offer.

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:40.534
- Eva, what is it?

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:42.053
- I know who I am.

01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:50.509
- Do something.

01:19:50.544 --> 01:19:52.201
- Here, I'll get help.

01:20:07.216 --> 01:20:08.631
- The team we would've made.

01:20:12.462 --> 01:20:13.462
- Riley!

01:20:25.061 --> 01:20:26.061
- No!

01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:36.072
Well, hello.

01:20:47.912 --> 01:20:51.570
At last.

01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:54.988
- Now, I will be complete,
and the world will be mine!

01:21:00.925 --> 01:21:01.925
What?

01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:03.962
Why is it not working?

01:21:07.828 --> 01:21:09.278
- Because of me.

01:21:09.312 --> 01:21:11.728
This is for Emma.

01:22:00.432 --> 01:22:02.918
- I think this belongs to you.

01:22:13.204 --> 01:22:18.209
- From every end,
starts a new beginning.

01:22:21.522 --> 01:22:22.522
A rebirth.

01:22:25.078 --> 01:22:26.078
A Renaissance.

01:22:29.323 --> 01:22:30.980
The Hamanaro strand was a lie.

01:22:32.292 --> 01:22:35.881
Good or evil is a choice.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.885
And free will does exist.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.686
To fight back against
evil is my choice,

01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:53.520
and my daughter Eva,
she was also my choice.

01:22:55.487 --> 01:22:57.558
Although Eva has the
blood of a traitor,

01:22:59.526 --> 01:23:02.356
she also has the
blood of an angel.

01:23:05.049 --> 01:23:07.016
But blood doesn't
make you who you are.

01:23:09.674 --> 01:23:11.296
It's your soul.

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:14.127
Your spirit.

01:23:15.852 --> 01:23:17.164
Your love of life.

01:23:20.167 --> 01:23:21.582
Of God.

01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:26.691
My eyes have been opened.

01:23:28.969 --> 01:23:31.040
And the loophole
has been closed.

01:23:32.697 --> 01:23:37.702
And if they return,
when they return,

01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:42.155
we will be waiting.

01:23:45.158 --> 01:23:47.056
And we will be ready.

01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:50.775
- So, what did you
think of my first novel?

01:24:50.809 --> 01:24:53.433
- Well, you know, I don't know.

01:24:53.467 --> 01:24:55.814
You know, to be honest, I didn't
even know you could write,

01:24:55.849 --> 01:24:59.715
but, you know, I didn't
understand half that junk

01:24:59.749 --> 01:25:02.925
with Sam, or whatever
his name was,

01:25:02.959 --> 01:25:05.790
and Judas and his
bloodline, but you know,

01:25:05.824 --> 01:25:07.757
I thought it was
pretty well-written.

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:11.244
But I really wanna
know where in the devil

01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:14.937
did you get the idea to
write a story like this?

01:25:14.971 --> 01:25:19.148
- I have a
crazy imagination.

01:25:19.183 --> 01:25:21.702
Um, I don't know,

01:25:21.737 --> 01:25:24.429
I wanted to combine my
three favorite things,

01:25:24.464 --> 01:25:27.950
the Bible, books,
and video games.

01:25:27.984 --> 01:25:30.987
I just, I really wrote it

01:25:31.022 --> 01:25:32.822
because I wanted people
to question the Bible,

01:25:32.851 --> 01:25:35.716
I wanted them to open one up

01:25:35.751 --> 01:25:38.788
and see if what I
wrote was true or not.

01:25:38.823 --> 01:25:41.481
- Well, Lexi, that's
great, that's really great.

01:25:41.515 --> 01:25:43.172
And comin' from
your old grandpa,

01:25:43.207 --> 01:25:44.622
I want you to always remember

01:25:44.656 --> 01:25:47.763
the true meaning of
the true gospel, okay?

01:25:47.797 --> 01:25:49.730
And you know, the
world's doing a great job

01:25:49.765 --> 01:25:51.525
of tryin' to screw
that message up.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.667
But the message,
Lexi, is very clear.

01:25:55.702 --> 01:26:00.224
Jesus came to this
Earth to save the world,

01:26:00.258 --> 01:26:02.640
and he died on the
cross for all of us,

01:26:02.674 --> 01:26:05.988
regardless of who we
were or what we did,

01:26:06.022 --> 01:26:08.093
and on the third day he rose,

01:26:08.128 --> 01:26:11.027
conquering sin and death
for all of mankind.

01:26:11.062 --> 01:26:13.927
Now, I don't want you
to forget that, okay?

01:26:13.961 --> 01:26:16.136
- I won't forget, Pap-pap.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.311
- Well, the other thing is,

01:26:18.345 --> 01:26:20.968
what are you gonna do with
this book, write a movie?

01:26:21.003 --> 01:26:24.869
- No, that would never happen.
