00:02.711 --> 00:04.167
(SIGHS) People are
already packing.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.329
I can't believe they're
shutting Eureka down.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.919
Well, it had to happen
eventually, right?

00:09.343 --> 00:10.549
Nice, Jack.
Very sensitive.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.220
I'm just saying,
as the thin blue line

00:12.387 --> 00:14.799
who separates innovation
from annihilation,

00:15.265 --> 00:16.550
I think we've had
a pretty good run.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.227
Where is everyone gonna go?
Where are we going to go?

00:19.394 --> 00:21.225
Well, we'll figure it out.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.058
I mean, as long as
we're together,
I think it'll be okay.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.189
This is so not okay!

00:26.944 --> 00:27.979
I know.
This is not okay.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.393
Come here. (GRUNTS)

00:31.615 --> 00:32.775
Sternum.

00:32.950 --> 00:33.814
Please eat something.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.903
l have a whole warehouse
full of organic perishables.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.284
You know what,
actually, I'm starving.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.284
You got it.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.570
(GROANS) Wow.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.783
You know,
I'll never forget the day

00:40.958 --> 00:43.244
you and Zoe walked
through my door, Sheriff.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.786
Yeah. Who knew she'd
go from delinquent
to doctor, huh?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.751
But she's flying in today
to say goodbye.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.419
I promised myself
lwouldn't... Cry.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.550
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.756
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:56.265 --> 00:57.380
Um, you know what?
I have to get to back
to G.D.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.300
and run some scans
on Holly before they start
packing up my lab.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.762
Okay. All right.
Whoo! Thanks.

01:02.521 --> 01:03.931
Wow. Does that come
with a feedbag?

01:04.773 --> 01:05.728
Oh, you're really
on a roll today.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.275
But, no, I know you're
gonna refrigerate it.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.478
It's not like
you're gonna, like, wolf it...

01:09.653 --> 01:11.143
(MIMICS GOBBLING)
With... With...

01:11.321 --> 01:12.572
Love you!
But...

01:18.996 --> 01:19.906
Hey.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.578
How you holding up?
Not well.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.999
You know, Grace's
hearing is today
and they won't tell me where.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.706
Yeah, they won't tell
me either. I'm sorry.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.339
It's not right, Jack.
I mean, the Henry from
the other time line...

01:32.509 --> 01:34.625
The Henry that's not you.
Convinced Grace to spy.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.966
You don't know what
information he and Grace
gave Beverly,

01:38.140 --> 01:39.801
or how they did it
or... Or...

01:39.975 --> 01:41.181
(SIGHS)

01:43.145 --> 01:45.932
That's absolutely right.
But I can find out.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.767
Hey, thanks.
Listen, I gotta go.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.353
Well, you're... You're...
Yeah.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.772
Glad I could help.

02:00.787 --> 02:01.902
(MURMURING) Okay.
(ROBOT SQUEAKS)

02:03.790 --> 02:05.291
Easy with that, Poindexter.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.491
Sorry. Emo won't stay
in his crate.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.705
You know, robots.
Sometimes they have
a mind of their own.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.165
Yeah, well, you break him,
you buy him.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.705
(WOMAN EXCLAIMS)
(CLATTERING)

02:12.883 --> 02:14.248
How goes the packing, JoJo?

02:14.426 --> 02:16.417
(CHUCKLES)
It's like herding cats.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.131
You making any progress
with Section Five?

02:18.305 --> 02:21.263
Slowly. I started a data
stream download this morning.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.845
But when you're packing
devices that could
destroy the world,

02:24.019 --> 02:26.180
it requires more than
a "Fragile" sticker.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.721
(CHUCKLES)
So, I, uh...

02:29.858 --> 02:31.314
I heard you had
a few job offers.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.684
Yeah. Yeah, um...

02:35.489 --> 02:37.775
Area 51 is looking for
a new security chief.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.573
But they're
a bunch of dorks.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.733
And, um...

02:42.329 --> 02:45.617
There's this thing for
the Presidential detail
in DC.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.531
Uh, how about you?

02:47.709 --> 02:51.122
Ah, the CERN Institute
are trying to get
the Hadron Collider to work.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.456
I mean, Switzerland.
Could be cool.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.921
And the Robotics Lab
at MIT.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.960
is looking for
a new chair of the organic
computing department.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.758
"Professor" Donovan, huh?

03:01.932 --> 03:03.968
Mmm-hmm.
And seeing as how
they expelled me,

03:04.142 --> 03:05.427
it would be
pretty sweet irony,
don't you think?

03:05.602 --> 03:06.591
(CHUCKLES)

03:06.770 --> 03:08.226
So, is there anything
you're leaning towards?

03:08.397 --> 03:11.389
I gotta make a list of
pros and cons, you know.
See what makes sense.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.561
Yeah, but what do you feel?

03:15.237 --> 03:16.852
Not just about feelings.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.648
These are really big decisions
and, um, we need
to be practical.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.740
Practical. (SCOFFS)

03:24.454 --> 03:25.785
Yes, we do.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.249
Hmm.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.282
I'm gonna
get back to this.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.121
Uh, I'll see you later.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.340
Well, your photonic processor
is humming along perfectly.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.129
Your vitals are good.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.765
Except I still can't remember
anything from after I first
came to Eureka.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.642
Like becoming
an astronaut.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.812
Or being kidnapped.
Or dying.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.814
Especially the dying part.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.567
That was awkward.
I can only imagine.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.824
Director Fargo also intimated
that we used to be intimate.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.990
Well, did that, uh,
spark any memories for you?

04:08.165 --> 04:11.157
No. I mean,
he seems really nice.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.541
His glasses are kinda sexy.

04:15.964 --> 04:19.127
But I'm just not sure I
feel that way about him.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.091
Holly, listen.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.719
Why don't you
spend some time getting
familiar with Eureka again?

04:24.890 --> 04:28.178
Talk to some people.
Ask questions.
Maybe that'll help.

04:29.186 --> 04:33.225
Yeah. That's a good idea,
Dr. Blake. Thank you.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.860
Good morning, Dr. Fargo.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.068
Are you okay?

04:44.242 --> 04:47.109
The universe is against me.
So I guess that's a "No."

04:47.287 --> 04:48.493
My girlfriend's gone.
My job is gone.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.743
Pretty soon this
whole town's gonna be gone.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.785
It's a difficult time
for all of us, sir.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.454
But it was going so great.
Our work has
never been better.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.585
Our performance
exceeded expectations.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.087
The President said
it was a budget issue.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.669
Does Los Alamos
have budget issues?
Or Area 51?

05:01.843 --> 05:03.799
I mean, we paved the way
for those guys.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.255
It's a cruel system.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.922
But at least they gave us
six more weeks to
wrap things up, right?

05:09.518 --> 05:10.803
Excuse me. I'm, uh,
I'm looking for Joe Lupo.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.012
Do you know where
I can find him?

05:12.187 --> 05:14.553
Uh, her. As in, me.

05:14.898 --> 05:15.887
That's awkward.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.310
Uh, yes, if you'd be
kind enough to take
us to Section Five,

05:18.485 --> 05:20.316
then, uh, we can get things
packed up and moving.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.352
Uh, no, you will not.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.320
We still have
six more weeks.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.398
Well, I guess someone at
the DOD. missed a memo

05:26.576 --> 05:28.191
because, uh,
the time line's changed.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.993
We start moving
Eureka out today.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.828
What?

05:35.210 --> 05:36.825
What the frack?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.769
CARTER: Everyone's
really excited to see you.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.273
And I can't believe
that you're about to
graduate from Harvard.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.310
(LAUGHS) Well, don't get too
excited. I haven't gotten
my final grades yet.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.735

the movers came early.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.238

06:15.959 --> 06:17.449
Are you doing okay?

06:17.627 --> 06:19.242
(HORN HONKING)
Um...

06:20.839 --> 06:23.080
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.090
Dad, it's okay to be upset.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.592
(LAUGHS) I'm not.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.762
Come on, after years
of saving these people from
themselves? (EXHALES)

06:31.641 --> 06:33.302
It'll be a relief.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.096
I may not be able to fix my
girlfriend's memory,
but I can fix this.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.354
Fargo, where are you going?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.688
Nowhere. This is an outrage.
Somebody needs to
take a stand.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.063
Fargo, that's kind of
the opposite of
taking a stand.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.199
Until the DOD.
reverses their decision,
I shall not be moved!

06:52.579 --> 06:53.568
You can't be serious.

Really?

07:18.355 --> 07:20.562
I can't believe you're
really okay with this.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.097
I'm fine.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.392
I don't know.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.997
Nothing. I Just activated
my strong-force amplifier.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.283
Oh, maybe at around the same
time the Jeep came screaming
into the rotunda?

09:04.461 --> 09:07.453
Okay, yeah, I admit
the timing is a little odd,

09:07.630 --> 09:09.962
but there's absolutely
no way that this
could be responsible.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.248

try to move me.

relocation thing?

weeks ago.

slow down the move?

about the evidence
against Grace.

Well, if Grace and other
Henry were sending
information to Beverly,

10:24.249 --> 10:25.364
they must have had
a way to contact her.

if you're trying to stop it.

a wormhole on the road

like the botched work

careless with their

this wormhole of yours,
is it stable?

Well, then clearly,
the piece of technology that
is causing it is still active.

this was caused by
traversing the wormhole.

Well, that would indicate that
the new wormhole isn't as
stable as the last one was.

Right. Unstable wormholes.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.032
It failed.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.203
So you asked us
to commit treason

22:13.749 --> 22:17.367
and we just
signed right up.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.161
No, | asked you
to think about
the greater good.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.632
Grace may go to prison.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.591
I am very sorry
to hear that.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.716
Then help her.
For old time's sake.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.930
Fargo, get up!

22:35.104 --> 22:38.016
Eureka is about to be
destroyed by a network
of wormholes.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.054
Yeah, tell me about it.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.064
But I convinced them
to give us an extra day

22:41.235 --> 22:42.566
so we can salvage
the situation.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.567
I think she meant
actual wormholes.

22:44.738 --> 22:48.230
Look, I stopped the movers
and they're not gonna take
anything until we fix this.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.573
Okay. Well, did you do
a tech inventory?

22:50.744 --> 22:52.200
My team checked
all the equipment containers.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.406
None of those projects
could be the cause.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.742
Guys, I can't find Henry.
I'm worried.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.323
Uh, yeah. I don't think
he's in town anymore.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.879
Well, don't you think
we should get him?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.420
What did you do?
What did you do?

23:03.591 --> 23:04.671
Nothing. Nothing.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.587
Okay, look,
he wanted to help Grace,

23:07.761 --> 23:10.423
so I pulled some information
off the data stream
so he could check into it.

23:10.598 --> 23:11.428
That's it.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.215
Uh, uh, do you mean
the quantum teleportation
data stream?

23:14.768 --> 23:17.726
Wait. Quantum teleportation.
That sounds a lot like
wormholes, right?

23:18.480 --> 23:20.391
Nice, Dad.
Thanks. I pick stuff up.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.772
Guys, that...
That can't be the cause.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.273
That system has a
quantum field stabilizer

23:23.444 --> 23:25.275
to prevent that kind of thing
from ever happening.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.482
Had a stabilizer.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.647
It was on the first truck
this morning out of town.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.273
Well, nobody told me that.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.443
(STAMMERS) lt must've gone
offline once it passed
the EM. barrier.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.611
Okay, that would have been
around the same time

23:35.789 --> 23:37.074
the Jeep ended up
in the rotunda, right?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.206
So call the trucks
and get it back.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.491
Yeah! What she said.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.169
Nah, if the wormholes are
already colliding, it may be
too late to stabilize them.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.002
All right, um... Uh, we'll go
in the other direction then.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.132
We'll... We'll, uh,
de-stabilize it
until it falls apart.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.292
Could that work?

23:50.471 --> 23:52.302
Well, if... If we could
get them all to align.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.589
Their combined
quantum energy could
make them all implode.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.803
Look at you
with your book learnin'.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.638
Okay, let's get to work.
Right.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.603
Maybe we should
go with them?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.935
Nah. No, l have
one more phone call to make.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.144
If they're going to
shut us down,

24:05.861 --> 24:07.522
I'm gonna make sure
it's on our terms.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.112
Oh. Hi.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.825
So by retuning
the data stream,

24:15.996 --> 24:20.160
theoretically this
should make the wormholes
collapse in on themselves.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.825
If you pull this off
you can write your own ticket.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.379
Is that what
you want me to do?

24:25.839 --> 24:27.704
I want you to do
whatever makes you happy.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.916
Well, what if that involves
being with you?

24:32.930 --> 24:34.170
(BEEPING)

24:35.182 --> 24:36.012
CARTER: Uh...

24:38.352 --> 24:39.717
We have a problem.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.775
I thought you said this thing
was gonna implode.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.686
I said, theoretically.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.905
After everything we have been
through you cannot let Grace
be sacrificed.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.290
I am very sorry, Henry.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.712
But I burned my bridges
when I broke with Senator Wen

25:05.879 --> 25:07.164
to help save
the Astraeus crew.

25:07.339 --> 25:11.048
Oh, you did
the right thing then.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.425
Do the right thing now.

25:15.389 --> 25:16.879
You're very
persuasive, Henry.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.467
You should have been
head of G.D.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.637
What do you
want me to do?

25:21.812 --> 25:23.643
Talk to the DOD.
on Grace's behalf.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.429
So they can arrest me?

25:25.858 --> 25:28.850
I want to do
the right thing here,
but not that right.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.734
Wait. I thought you cared
about the greater good.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.030
But you know what?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.487
You're deluding yourself
and, clearly, so am I.

25:34.658 --> 25:35.818
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

25:35.993 --> 25:38.735
I gotta go.
There are people who need me.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.580
(DOOR CLOSES)

25:46.587 --> 25:48.452
Henry, where the hell
have you been?
I'll put you on speaker.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.245
Uh, meeting an old friend.
What's happening?

25:50.424 --> 25:52.415
Well, the good news is
we moved all the bisecting
tunnels into one,

25:52.593 --> 25:54.003
so Eureka's not
gonna go Swiss cheese.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.294
But the sub-nuclear
stresses are building
to a critical level.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.011
They won't hold for long.

25:58.182 --> 25:59.262
You have to stabilize
the strong forces,

25:59.433 --> 26:01.765
or the tunnel will tear
Eureka apart on a gluon level.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.930
That sounds unpleasant.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.844
ZANE: Tough to do
with all of our
equipment gone.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.478
Um, could... Could...
Could we use Fargo's
strong thingy?

26:10.027 --> 26:10.982
I'm not sure where
you're going here.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.686
His wrist.
(STAMMERING) The wrist.
The thing he had...

26:13.864 --> 26:15.354
Strong force amplifier.
Yes. Yeah.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.612
Yeah, maybe,
if we can boost the strength

26:16.784 --> 26:18.149
and get it into the center
of the wormhole somehow.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.567
All right, I'm on it.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.820
FARGO: It would be tragic
for Eureka to end this way.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.534
Think of it
as an investment.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.323
We made you
who you are today.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.875
So I think a little
payback is in order.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.661
l'll await your call.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.206
Well, that was my
Hail Mary pass.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.965
Well, at least you didn't go
down without a fight.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.423
HOLLY: Douglas?

26:39.306 --> 26:41.171
Holly? Hi.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.469
How are you feeling?

26:43.644 --> 26:45.180
That was...

26:45.938 --> 26:48.771
And... And this is just...
You're really...

26:52.861 --> 26:55.273
Does... Does this mean
you remember us?

26:56.782 --> 26:58.989
It's still
a little bit fuzzy.

27:03.664 --> 27:04.779
CARTER: Fargo, get up!

27:05.666 --> 27:06.997
We gotta put your thing
in a hole before it blows.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.282
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

27:10.045 --> 27:11.660
You heard the man.

27:11.839 --> 27:12.954
Uh...

27:16.885 --> 27:19.001
Okay. This should give it
enough boost

27:19.179 --> 27:20.214
to amplify the strong forces

27:20.389 --> 27:22.254
as it passes through,
making the tunnel implode.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.468
Okay. And then...
And then just throw it in?

27:24.643 --> 27:27.180
Yeah, not exactly.
lt's calibrated to
the human subatomic field.

27:28.188 --> 27:31.680
(SIGHS) It only works
if it's attached to a person.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.647
Of course it does.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.980
We're running out of time.
Is it ready?

27:39.158 --> 27:43.322
Yeah. Yeah. Nobody moves
till this thing's done. Okay?

27:43.871 --> 27:44.951
Okay.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.284
Oh, oh. I remember now.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.868
You guys are smart,
but the Sheriff is
the strong force.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.377
He holds it all together.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.622
He always does.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.010
Jack, wait!
What?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.220
I don't want
you to do this.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.180
I don't wanna do it either,
but we don't have a lot of
options here.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.685
No, I'm serious.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.147
Okay, I...

28:17.154 --> 28:20.237
I know I haven't
been very sensitive
about all this

28:23.076 --> 28:24.941
but, uh, this is our home.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.410
And this...

28:31.585 --> 28:33.246
This is what I do.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.251
Just for luck.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.101
See you soon.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.153
You'd better.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.952

30:33.290 --> 30:34.746
Oh, man. Are you okay?
Yeah.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.326
Come on.
Why are we standing?

30:36.710 --> 30:37.790
It's all right.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.543
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You okay?

30:40.964 --> 30:42.795
Yeah, I saw my...
My life just flash
before my eyes.

30:43.759 --> 30:44.714
How'd it look?

30:47.304 --> 30:48.669
Pretty good.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.304
Good. All right.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.598
Think you can make it?
(GRUNTS)

30:54.227 --> 30:55.603
Here we go.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.144
Careful with that couch.
lt's imported!

31:02.319 --> 31:04.184
Hello? Anybody home?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.364
Not for long.

31:10.994 --> 31:14.578
It did, but, uh, I know
there's something else
on the horizon.

31:14.748 --> 31:15.988
Mmm-mmm.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.825
Speaking of which,
I have been asked
to join a new

31:20.003 --> 31:21.914
super-secret project
for "DARPA."

31:23.215 --> 31:26.707
Really? That's...
That's great. Um, where?

31:27.886 --> 31:30.298
Well, that's kind of
part of the secret.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.762
I think it travels
a lot.

31:34.643 --> 31:38.386
And | get to pick
my own team.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.561
I like to travel.

31:46.071 --> 31:46.981
Good.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.486
(LARRY CLEARS THROAT) Oh.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.659
Sir. Secretary of Defense.

31:51.827 --> 31:52.737
Oh.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.996
Director Douglas Fargo.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.581
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

32:01.795 --> 32:02.545
Really?

32:04.756 --> 32:06.132
Okay. Um...

32:08.218 --> 32:10.675
Thank you for
keeping me in the loop, sir.

32:15.934 --> 32:16.798
What happened?

32:19.312 --> 32:21.052
Eureka's been sold.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.180
(HONNNG)

32:28.363 --> 32:30.945
After all of that,
we still lose the town.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.606
You did everything
humanly possible.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.025
Yeah. It wasn't
enough, though.

32:36.663 --> 32:40.406
Eureka's never been about
the town. It's always
been about the people.

32:40.584 --> 32:41.448
You saved them.

32:42.335 --> 32:45.998
So, wherever they go,
they are our legacy.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.879
Looks like our legacy
just got a little brighter.

Henry...

33:02.105 --> 33:03.220
What did you do?

33:04.524 --> 33:05.980
I got my wife back.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.813
And I am never going
anywhere again.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.603
I'm gonna hold you to that.

33:28.298 --> 33:29.378
Ah.

It led to Senator Wen
and evidence that tied her to
the abduction of the crew.

it's win-Wen.

me in for?

34:24.271 --> 34:25.977
What are you doing?

34:31.778 --> 34:33.734
I'm going with what I feel.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.527
I got you something.

Did you now?

you want me to
try this on for you?

Something like that.

l'd mess it up.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.857

35:15.530 --> 35:18.988
I don't wanna miss out
on us again.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.366
So what do you say?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.877
Will you make an honest
woman out of me?

35:40.055 --> 35:41.340

35:46.770 --> 35:48.306
I love you, Jo.

35:51.733 --> 35:52.973
I love you.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.523
I am so sorry
but I gave away
all the champagne already.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.443
Oh, Vincent, do not worry.
I'm just happy to be here.

36:00.617 --> 36:01.948
Anything to toast with
is fine.

36:02.118 --> 36:07.238
Good, because
the gentleman outside
asked me to pass this along.

36:09.751 --> 36:10.740
Cheval Nuit.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.458
1947?

36:13.672 --> 36:14.661
Yeah.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.215
(DOOR OPENS)

36:16.841 --> 36:19.048
ALLISON: Oh.
(HENRY CHUCKLES)

36:19.219 --> 36:20.755
Grant.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.088
I prefer
Dr. Trent Rockwell, sport.

36:25.058 --> 36:26.548
What? Seriously?

36:26.726 --> 36:28.341
(STAMMERING) Why...
Why'd you choose that name?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.727
Well, Trevor Grant's
so 20th century, right?

36:31.189 --> 36:34.477
Trent Rockwell, | feel,
conjures the essence,

36:35.026 --> 36:37.984
the entrepreneurial
spirit of a visionary
billionaire.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.232
A billionaire with
so much foresight

36:40.407 --> 36:44.571
he's just sunk his
entire fortune into
a ridiculous project

36:44.744 --> 36:46.280
with little chance
of financial return.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.782
What are you talking about?

36:48.957 --> 36:50.163
I got a call
from Douglas.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.411
He told me about
your funding being cutoff.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.537
He also gave me
a very persuasive argument
for keeping the doors open.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.542
You bought Eureka?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.926
Well, I am one of the town's
founders, after all.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.760
Before I hand over
the keys

37:08.309 --> 37:10.049
I do have one condition.

37:12.105 --> 37:15.438
She's married, pal,
so no indecent proposals.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.731
No, uh, the current director
of G.D. is stepping down.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.233
So naturally, he's gonna
need a successor.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.480
Douglas gave me
his recommendations,

37:23.950 --> 37:26.908
and I can't imagine Eureka
being in better hands.

37:27.912 --> 37:28.992
I'd be honored

37:30.874 --> 37:32.239
to respect your wishes.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.119
Henry?

37:36.796 --> 37:37.706
What do you say?

37:39.132 --> 37:41.339
Are you ready
to change the world?

37:44.137 --> 37:45.047
(MOUTHING)

37:47.140 --> 37:48.220
You got a deal.
Oh!

37:48.391 --> 37:49.301
Congratulations.
(LAUGHS)

37:49.809 --> 37:52.926
That's great. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.144
(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

37:55.315 --> 37:56.805
WOMAN: I'm gonna
say, "Cheers."
ALL: Cheers!

37:56.983 --> 37:58.484
(ALL LAUGHING)

37:58.943 --> 38:00.558
GRACE: Thank you.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.197
ALLISON: Can you come
talk with me?

38:10.079 --> 38:13.446
(SIGHS) Well,
it's been quite a week, huh?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.205
Yeah.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.996
Yeah, it's...
It's been quite a journey.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.754
We wouldn't be here
without you.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.340
Yeah, well...

38:27.180 --> 38:29.387
As much as I
like to complain,

38:31.518 --> 38:33.258
there's no place
I'd rather be.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.053
You're sure?

38:43.780 --> 38:45.190
Without a doubt.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.360
(WHISPERS) Good.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.623
Because I'd really like
our baby to be born here.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.329
Uh...
(LAUGHS)

39:02.507 --> 39:04.043
I'm pregnant.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.510
You're gonna be
a daddy again, Jack.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.548
Can you handle that?
(LAUGHS)

39:14.227 --> 39:15.558
I... Uh...

39:18.231 --> 39:19.311
Jack? What is it?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.188
Uh, it'sjust
a little deja vu.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.820
Come here.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.908
I can't wait.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.206
Just another day

39:46.384 --> 39:48.750
We never forget

39:49.762 --> 39:51.923
Life takes a turn

39:52.098 --> 39:54.589
That we don't expect

39:55.935 --> 39:58.347
One journey ends

39:58.521 --> 40:01.058
Another is set

40:01.232 --> 40:05.692
And I have found

40:06.446 --> 40:08.607
You are my home

40:19.876 --> 40:22.288
One day we're lost

40:22.462 --> 40:25.374
Another, we're found

40:25.965 --> 40:28.126
So hard to know

40:28.301 --> 40:30.462
Which way's up or down

40:31.971 --> 40:34.348
Somehow we land

40:34.515 --> 40:36.801
Feet back on the ground

40:37.310 --> 40:41.644
And I have found

40:42.398 --> 40:45.231
You are my home

40:50.239 --> 40:54.198
Another day is done

40:56.329 --> 40:59.492
Another setting sun

40:59.666 --> 41:03.705
We have come home

41:07.799 --> 41:10.040
So take my hand

41:10.218 --> 41:12.675
They're playing our song

41:14.013 --> 41:16.299
All that we have

41:16.474 --> 41:18.806
Will never be gone

41:19.936 --> 41:22.052
One thing I know

41:22.230 --> 41:25.097
Though we travel on

41:25.274 --> 41:29.984
ls l have found

41:30.863 --> 41:32.774
You are my home

41:38.246 --> 41:41.113
Well, we'll all fly out for
graduation on Friday,

41:42.375 --> 41:43.581
but summa cum laude,

41:45.712 --> 41:46.747
it's impressive.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.329
We've come
a long way together.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.213
Yes. Yes, we have.

41:57.974 --> 42:00.681
Oh, wow.
High beams, moron.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.302
Oh, it's...

42:12.780 --> 42:15.396
Dad? Did you just see...

42:22.165 --> 42:23.325
l'll deal with that tomorrow.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.909
One thing I know

42:28.421 --> 42:30.833
Though we travel on

42:31.257 --> 42:35.921
ls l have found

42:37.096 --> 42:40.463
You are my home

43:06.584 --> 43:08.916
Subtitling : C.M.C.
