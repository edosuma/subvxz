01:20.087 --> 01:21.552
<i>Hello, James.</i>

01:21.554 --> 01:24.923
<i>You have one new ride request.</i>

01:24.925 --> 01:26.825
Hello.

01:26.827 --> 01:29.429
<i>Ride accepted.
Let's ride.</i>

01:40.640 --> 01:42.007
<i>As the sun goes down</i>

01:42.009 --> 01:44.376
<i>and the lights come up
on Los Angeles,</i>

01:44.378 --> 01:47.011
<i>you begin to hear
the true voices of the city.</i>

01:47.013 --> 01:51.049
<i>It's 10:06 p.m.,
and this is the Voice of L.A.</i>

02:03.629 --> 02:07.498
<i>In 300 feet, make
a right turn onto Vine Street.</i>

02:07.500 --> 02:08.967
<i>Today what we'll be discussing</i>

02:08.969 --> 02:11.503
<i>is the "big break"
and whether an actor</i>

02:11.505 --> 02:13.604
<i>can have multiple big breaks,
just one,</i>

02:13.606 --> 02:14.740
<i>and is there a time
in our career</i>

02:14.742 --> 02:16.508
<i>where we can miss our shot,</i>

02:16.510 --> 02:18.446
<i>which that big break
is never gonna come again.</i>

02:28.554 --> 02:31.625
<i>In 300 feet,
make a left turn.</i>

02:40.400 --> 02:44.872
<i>In 300 feet, make a right turn
onto Franklin Avenue.</i>

02:53.012 --> 02:55.680
<i>You have arrived.</i>

02:55.682 --> 02:58.049
<i>And thank you
for tuning in with us tonight.</i>

02:58.051 --> 03:00.855
<i>Stay warm out there, L.A.</i>

03:10.130 --> 03:11.866
Hey, Jessica?

03:12.832 --> 03:14.999
- Yeah, that's me.
- I'm your ride.

03:15.001 --> 03:16.470
Cool.

03:19.906 --> 03:22.944
- James.
- Nice to meet you.

03:24.577 --> 03:26.777
All right.

03:26.779 --> 03:28.580
Where to?

03:28.582 --> 03:31.586
<i>♪ Just when I thought
I'd seen it all ♪</i>

03:32.586 --> 03:36.757
<i>♪ You came along to rescue me ♪</i>

03:37.857 --> 03:42.727
<i>♪ You read my writing
on the wall ♪</i>

03:42.729 --> 03:47.665
<i>♪ You found my bottle
in the sea ♪</i>

03:47.667 --> 03:49.935
Hey, do you want a water
or some gum?

03:49.937 --> 03:51.770
Do they always
make you say that?

03:51.772 --> 03:53.938
They do.

03:53.940 --> 03:57.808
But in your case, uh,
I mean it.

03:57.810 --> 04:00.748
Uh, no. Thank you.
I'm okay.

04:04.183 --> 04:06.016
How long you been
riding with us?

04:06.018 --> 04:08.118
About six months.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.489
I use it a lot between,
you know, not wanting to park

04:10.491 --> 04:12.723
and wanting a couple drinks.

04:12.725 --> 04:14.225
Yeah, that's cool.

04:14.227 --> 04:17.062
I'm not, like, deeply passionate
about it or anything,

04:17.064 --> 04:19.898
but it's nice to think that,
you know, because of what I do,

04:19.899 --> 04:21.665
there's less drunk drivers
out there.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.834
Not that that would be you
or anything.

04:23.836 --> 04:26.538
Well, I mean,
everybody in L.A. drives drunk.

04:26.540 --> 04:27.973
Oh, come on, not everybody.

04:27.975 --> 04:29.143
Think about it.

04:29.145 --> 04:30.975
Try and name
at least person you know

04:30.977 --> 04:33.881
that hasn't made a mistake once.

04:35.249 --> 04:37.915
- Mm.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

04:37.917 --> 04:39.050
See what I'm saying?

04:39.052 --> 04:40.886
- I do. I get you.
- Yeah.

04:40.888 --> 04:42.521
<i>In 300 feet,</i>

04:42.523 --> 04:45.624

04:45.626 --> 04:48.627
- Oh, uh, take Fountain.
- Oh.

04:48.629 --> 04:50.795
<i>Recalculating.</i>

04:50.797 --> 04:52.129
Mae West fan?

04:52.131 --> 04:54.665
Uh, what... what do you mean?

04:54.667 --> 04:57.067
Well, there's this
great Mae West interview.

04:57.069 --> 04:58.737
Uh, I think it was
Johnny Carson or something.

04:58.739 --> 05:00.204
Whoever it was said,

05:00.206 --> 05:02.173
"What's the fastest way
to get into Hollywood?"

05:02.175 --> 05:03.675
to which she replied...

05:03.677 --> 05:05.709
"Take Fountain."

05:06.980 --> 05:09.617
That's cool.
I like that.

05:15.088 --> 05:18.689
<i>♪ Just when I thought
I'd seen it all ♪</i>

05:18.691 --> 05:21.192
Um, I, uh, I like your suit,
by the way.

05:21.194 --> 05:22.726
What, do you, like, uh,

05:22.728 --> 05:24.963
moonlight as a limo driver
or something?

05:24.965 --> 05:26.665
I wish.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.699
It was, uh, for this thing
that I had before this.

05:28.701 --> 05:30.201
A wedding?

05:30.203 --> 05:31.670
An audition.

05:31.672 --> 05:33.805
Oh, so you're an actor.

05:33.807 --> 05:35.906
Mm-hmm.
Unfortunately, yeah.

05:35.908 --> 05:38.576
God, I could never be an actor.

05:38.578 --> 05:40.678
I just...
I can't take the rejection.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.112
See, I just had to realize

05:42.114 --> 05:45.050
that getting turned down
isn't a failure.

05:45.052 --> 05:47.117
Not getting auditions,
that's failure.

05:47.119 --> 05:48.752
So you get a lot, then?

05:48.754 --> 05:51.822
Uh, my agents have gotten better
at sending me out.

05:51.824 --> 05:52.923
Oh, you're repped?

05:52.925 --> 05:54.158
- Mm-hmm.
- By who?

05:54.160 --> 05:57.795
- Uh, Abrams.
- Mm, you fancy, huh?

05:57.797 --> 05:59.930
Abrams.

05:59.932 --> 06:01.766
They're pretty good.
I'm not... They're pretty good.

06:01.768 --> 06:04.603
There was a dry spell, though,
like six months of nothing.

06:04.605 --> 06:06.737
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it was rough.

06:06.739 --> 06:09.143
But, um, then they kind of
sent me out on this thing.

06:09.145 --> 06:11.108
I think it was, like,
the last Hail Mary pass.

06:11.110 --> 06:14.045
Inches from getting dropped,
but I booked it.

06:14.047 --> 06:15.146
Oh, what?
Congrats!

06:15.148 --> 06:16.747
- Thanks.
- That's so cool.

06:16.749 --> 06:18.182
What, uh... What is it?

06:18.184 --> 06:19.850
Uh, it's no big deal.

06:19.852 --> 06:21.952
It's, like, a guest spot
on "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

06:21.954 --> 06:25.023
No big deal?
That's a huge fucking deal.

06:25.025 --> 06:27.225
Congrats!
That's so cool.

06:27.227 --> 06:28.860
Thanks.
It's a henchman.

06:28.862 --> 06:31.730
You know, couple lines,
and I took someone's gun.

06:31.732 --> 06:33.964
But still, so cool.

06:33.966 --> 06:36.668
I did start going out a lot more
because of it, so...

06:36.670 --> 06:40.105
<i>In 300 feet, make a right turn
onto Fountain Avenue.</i>

06:40.107 --> 06:43.641
Um, you should, uh,
let me know when it airs.

06:43.643 --> 06:46.978
My roommate, Allie,
is a huge Marvel fan,

06:46.980 --> 06:48.879
and she's just
gonna freak her shit

06:48.881 --> 06:51.649
when I tell her that my driver's
on "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

06:51.651 --> 06:53.317
as a cool villain.

06:53.319 --> 06:54.819
Well, I was... I was a henchman.

06:54.821 --> 06:57.055
I haven't graduated
to villain yet.

06:57.057 --> 07:00.927
Well, I believe in you.

07:06.199 --> 07:09.336
<i>Continue for three-quarters
of a mile.</i>

07:13.407 --> 07:17.011
<i>Your destination will be
on the right.</i>

07:18.444 --> 07:19.910
Here we are.

07:19.912 --> 07:21.245
That was fast.

07:21.247 --> 07:23.113
Hey, when in doubt,
take Fountain.

07:23.115 --> 07:24.449
Yeah, exactly.

07:24.451 --> 07:26.084
<i>You have reached
your destination.</i>

07:26.086 --> 07:28.655
<i>We hope you had
a safe and pleasant ride.</i>

07:29.823 --> 07:33.692
Hey, can I, uh,
tip you or something?

07:33.694 --> 07:35.326
We're not allowed
to accept tips.

07:35.328 --> 07:37.095
Uh, the app takes care
of everything.

07:37.097 --> 07:39.430
Right. Well, uh...

07:39.432 --> 07:41.766
I'll be sure to give you
a five-star rating, then.

07:41.768 --> 07:43.367
Right back at you.

07:43.369 --> 07:46.271
Wait, the... the drivers
rate the passengers?

07:46.273 --> 07:47.471
Yeah, sure.

07:47.473 --> 07:50.975
Oh, okay.
So what's my rating, then?

07:50.977 --> 07:53.110
I wouldn't worry about it
if I were you.

07:53.112 --> 07:54.946
Oh, okay.

07:54.948 --> 07:56.247
I'm not gonna leave this car

07:56.249 --> 07:57.917
until you tell me
what my rating is.

07:59.285 --> 08:02.220
- It's 3.5. But it...
- Fucking seriously?

08:02.222 --> 08:05.389
- But it doesn't mean anything.
- 3.5? People hate me.

08:05.391 --> 08:07.091
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- Oh, my God.

08:07.093 --> 08:08.860
It doesn't mean anything,
you know?

08:08.862 --> 08:11.295
Well, how do I...
how do I turn this shit around?

08:11.297 --> 08:13.732
Look, you're a five-star
passenger in my book.

08:13.734 --> 08:15.165
And that's all that matters,
right?

08:15.167 --> 08:18.004
- That's all that matters.
- Mm.

08:20.506 --> 08:24.278
Well, uh, thank you
for the ride, James.

08:25.145 --> 08:26.814
Anytime.

08:37.857 --> 08:40.991
Oh, uh, you forget something?

08:40.993 --> 08:42.826
So my friends and I

08:42.828 --> 08:44.863
were just grabbing
a couple drinks here.

08:44.865 --> 08:46.197
Very, you know, low-key,

08:46.199 --> 08:49.033
if you want to come in
for a round.

08:49.035 --> 08:53.104
<i>Hello, James.
You have one new ride request.</i>

08:53.106 --> 08:57.041
I wish.
But I got to drive.

08:57.043 --> 08:58.208
- Boo.
- I know.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.477
Okay, well, suit yourself,
but, uh,

09:00.479 --> 09:01.980
we'll be here
for a couple hours,

09:01.982 --> 09:06.049
so if you pick up
a big fare, swing by.

09:06.051 --> 09:08.485
I'd love that.
Yeah.

09:08.487 --> 09:10.424
Okay. Bye.

09:18.265 --> 09:19.864
"Oh, hey,
what's your phone number?

09:19.866 --> 09:21.032
Oh, no, here's my phone number."

09:21.034 --> 09:23.003
Fucking idiot.

09:23.969 --> 09:26.471
<i>Ride accepted.
Let's ride.</i>

09:31.444 --> 09:36.483
<i>Continue on Sunset Boulevard
for three-quarters of a mile.</i>

09:39.051 --> 09:40.854
<i>Turn left.</i>

09:50.063 --> 09:54.268
<i>Continue on
Gower Street for one mile.</i>

09:57.469 --> 09:59.239
<i>Ride canceled.</i>

10:06.979 --> 10:09.013
<i>Loneliness is
an emotional state</i>

10:09.015 --> 10:11.081
<i>that we have when
we're feeling disconnected.</i>

10:11.083 --> 10:12.951
<i>It can cause depression,</i>

10:12.953 --> 10:15.286
<i>and it can even lead
to premature death.</i>

10:15.288 --> 10:16.955
Oh, wow.

10:16.957 --> 10:18.489
<i>We're spending less time
making meaningful...</i>

10:18.491 --> 10:21.024
<i>This is the Voice of L.A.</i>

10:21.026 --> 10:23.260
<i>The time now is 10:45 p.m.</i>

10:23.262 --> 10:28.298
<i>Hello, James.
You have one new ride request.</i>

10:28.300 --> 10:30.403
So your parents went with Bruno?

10:34.207 --> 10:36.607
At least people
seem to like you.

10:36.609 --> 10:39.379
<i>Ride accepted.
Let's ride.</i>

10:48.320 --> 10:50.557
<i>You have arrived.</i>

10:54.593 --> 10:56.530
Uh, hey!

10:58.899 --> 11:01.068
- What's up?
- Are you Bruno?

11:08.909 --> 11:10.110
Who wants to know?

11:11.077 --> 11:12.376
Oh, fuck.

11:12.378 --> 11:14.144
You're my ride.
Of course.

11:14.146 --> 11:16.547
Uh, sorry, man. I didn't think
you'd get here so soon.

11:16.549 --> 11:19.350
Look, shit got a little messy.
Start the meter.

11:19.352 --> 11:23.023
Well, that's... that's not how
this works.

11:33.232 --> 11:35.600
Yo, you're looking sharp, bro.

11:35.602 --> 11:37.567
Is that like
a uniform or something?

11:37.569 --> 11:40.104
Something like that.

11:40.106 --> 11:42.639
Oh, hey, man.
Uh, can't smoke in my car.

11:42.641 --> 11:45.375
Fuck me.
So sorry, brother.

11:45.377 --> 11:48.078
Uh, I'm gonna finish this guy
if that's all right with you.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.346
You can start the meter.
I don't give a shit.

11:49.348 --> 11:51.381
That's actually
not how it works.

11:51.383 --> 11:52.582
Oh, well, fuck it.

11:52.584 --> 11:54.085
I'll throw
some extra cash your way,

11:54.087 --> 11:55.119
make it worth your while.

11:55.121 --> 11:56.321
Can't accept tips, bro.

11:56.323 --> 11:57.721
The app takes care
of everything.

11:57.723 --> 12:00.524
I won't tell anyone
if you don't.

12:00.526 --> 12:02.159
The thing is,
this is a New York pack

12:02.161 --> 12:04.262
so the cigs are really
fucking expensive.

12:04.264 --> 12:06.397
I know you're thinking I could
get the same goddamn cigs here

12:06.399 --> 12:07.698
for half the goddamn price,

12:07.700 --> 12:10.467
but I don't know
what to tell you.

12:10.469 --> 12:12.302
I'm a sentimental guy.

12:12.304 --> 12:13.504
You want one?

12:13.506 --> 12:15.273
Uh, I'm good, man.
Thanks.

12:15.275 --> 12:17.741
<i>James, please enter
a destination.</i>

12:17.743 --> 12:21.412
Yo, aren't you gonna offer me,
like, a... a water or something?

12:21.414 --> 12:24.014
- Some gum?
- What?

12:24.016 --> 12:27.719
That's what you guys
usually do, isn't it?

12:27.721 --> 12:31.292
Yeah.

12:33.559 --> 12:35.225
Yo, you want a water?

12:35.227 --> 12:37.595
No. No, not right now.
I'm good, man.

12:37.597 --> 12:39.464
Thanks. Maybe later.

12:39.466 --> 12:41.398
Hey, where we going, man?

12:41.400 --> 12:44.434
Straight to business.
I can respect that.

12:47.473 --> 12:51.045
LAX? Burbank?

12:52.245 --> 12:53.677
Don't tell me
I got to go to Long Beach.

12:53.679 --> 12:56.681
Yo, what the fuck
are you talking about, man?

12:56.683 --> 12:59.783
Airports.
It's your bag.

12:59.785 --> 13:01.385
Oh. Gotcha.

13:01.387 --> 13:04.721
No, no, no.
That's a messy breakup.

13:04.723 --> 13:06.591
I'm actually not sure
where I want to go right now.

13:06.593 --> 13:10.794
I just needed
to get away from her.

13:10.796 --> 13:14.599
I'm sorry to hear that, man.
Breakups are awful.

13:15.668 --> 13:18.036
<i>I love you.</i>

13:18.038 --> 13:21.408
<i>I... I know.</i>

13:22.409 --> 13:24.509
Yeah.

13:24.511 --> 13:26.679
Yeah, brother, they really are.

13:30.116 --> 13:31.749
All right, Bruno.

13:31.751 --> 13:33.087
Where we headed?

13:34.353 --> 13:36.086
Your name's James, right?

13:36.088 --> 13:37.554
I mean, that's what
the thing said.

13:37.556 --> 13:39.090
Yeah. That's right.

13:39.092 --> 13:41.259
Ask me again.

13:41.261 --> 13:42.527
Ask what again?

13:42.529 --> 13:44.629
"Where to, Bruno?"

13:44.631 --> 13:47.398
All right.
Where to?

13:47.400 --> 13:50.067
Home, James,
and don't spare the horses!

13:53.305 --> 13:55.072
Sorry.

13:55.074 --> 13:56.640
I couldn't resist.

13:56.642 --> 13:58.643
I'm sure you get that
all the time.

13:58.645 --> 14:03.114
To be honest, uh, you're the
first to make the connection.

14:03.116 --> 14:07.487
Oh. It is kind of my specialty,
making connections.

14:09.488 --> 14:12.255
I could really go for some of
that gum if you've got any.

14:12.257 --> 14:15.028
- What?
- That gum you mentioned earlier.

14:22.334 --> 14:24.668
<i>James, please enter
a destination.</i>

14:24.670 --> 14:27.238
All right, Bruno.
Where you want to go?

14:27.240 --> 14:28.505
Look, I don't want to
put you out,

14:28.507 --> 14:30.142
but would you mind taking me

14:30.144 --> 14:32.243
to a couple of different
places tonight?

14:32.245 --> 14:33.711
It'll be a big fare for you,

14:33.713 --> 14:35.446
and I'll throw some extra cash
on top.

14:35.448 --> 14:37.414
Look, man,
I'm sorry about this,

14:37.416 --> 14:40.884
but I just don't have
a long ride in me tonight.

14:40.886 --> 14:43.221
And like I said,
I can't accept tips.

14:43.223 --> 14:45.755
And like I said,
I won't tell if you don't.

14:45.757 --> 14:47.424
That's nice and everything,

14:47.426 --> 14:49.860
but I kind of got somewhere
I need to be in an hour.

14:49.862 --> 14:51.696
- In an hour?
- Yeah.

14:51.698 --> 14:54.898
My man, you couldn't have made
it to LAX to save your life.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.833
Come on, you give me
a couple hours,

14:56.835 --> 15:03.807
and I will throw $100
on top of the fare.

15:03.809 --> 15:06.344
You need like a minute
to think about that?

15:06.346 --> 15:08.379
<i>And the best
thing about public radio</i>

15:08.381 --> 15:09.514
<i>is there are no commercials.</i>

15:09.516 --> 15:10.715
- That'll work.
- All right.

15:10.717 --> 15:12.482
Let's get fucking rolling.

15:12.484 --> 15:15.519
Now, first,
I am feeling majorly down,

15:15.521 --> 15:17.388
so I'm gonna need
a massive pick-me-up.

15:17.390 --> 15:19.222
Do you know this place Eidobon?

15:19.224 --> 15:21.158
That's "nobodie"
spelled backwards.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.528
- I'm not sure.
- It's the spot off Larchmont.

15:23.530 --> 15:26.297
It's on Beverly and Beachwood,
south side.

15:26.299 --> 15:27.532
All right.

15:27.534 --> 15:31.201
They do this
fucking coffee there.

15:31.203 --> 15:32.802
It's fucking incredible.

15:32.804 --> 15:34.404
- Wait, wait.
- It was started by this guy...

15:34.406 --> 15:35.706
You want coffee right now?

15:35.708 --> 15:37.374
Yeah.
Only way to go is up.

15:37.376 --> 15:39.677
Do you have, like,
a piece of paper for this gum?

15:39.679 --> 15:42.346
Sure.

15:42.348 --> 15:44.351
Here.

15:46.819 --> 15:48.451
Anyway, so this coffee

15:48.453 --> 15:50.187
was started
by this guy with this website.

15:50.189 --> 15:51.956
And he was hiking
in the Himalayas,

15:51.958 --> 15:53.924
and he was on the brink
of exhaustion,

15:53.926 --> 15:56.793
and he met these monks,
and the monks gave him this tea.

15:56.795 --> 15:59.964
And guess what was in the tea.
Yak butter.

15:59.966 --> 16:03.668
Fucking butter
from fucking yaks.

16:03.670 --> 16:05.369
So he gets back to the States

16:05.371 --> 16:07.638
and tries all kinds of shit
to replicate it.

16:07.640 --> 16:12.610
And after months of failure,
guess what the key was.

16:12.612 --> 16:15.346
- What was it?
- Grass.

16:15.348 --> 16:19.350
It had to be grass-fed butter.

16:19.352 --> 16:21.719
This stuff is ambrosia, bro.

16:21.721 --> 16:23.854
Dude made millions
or some shit.

16:23.856 --> 16:26.323
- That's cool.
- You want one? I'll get you one.

16:26.325 --> 16:28.592
Nah, man. I don't... I don't
really drink coffee this late.

16:28.594 --> 16:29.994
Why?
It makes you feel weird?

16:29.996 --> 16:31.528
Do you know why?
Toxins.

16:31.530 --> 16:33.697
Most coffee is full of toxins

16:33.699 --> 16:35.666
because the beans
are covered in mold.

16:35.668 --> 16:39.570
But this coffee is lab tested.
They take all the toxins out.

16:39.572 --> 16:41.304
- Mm.
- Right?

16:41.306 --> 16:42.773
Okay, well, we're here.

16:42.775 --> 16:46.344
Um, okay, cool. Let me finish.
Where was I?

16:46.346 --> 16:47.644
They take all the toxins out,

16:47.646 --> 16:49.913
and then they brew it
as a pour-over,

16:49.915 --> 16:51.615
which then they mix it
with the grass-fed butter

16:51.617 --> 16:53.918
and this special
fortified coconut oil.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.885
Dude, if done properly,

16:55.887 --> 16:59.256
I defy any fucking barista
to make a creamier

16:59.258 --> 17:00.924
or more delicious cup of coffee

17:00.926 --> 17:02.759
than the one I am
about to buy you.

17:02.761 --> 17:04.795
You down?

17:04.797 --> 17:06.596
Dude, you down?

17:06.598 --> 17:08.566
Sure, man, I'm down.

17:08.568 --> 17:10.737
Great.
I'll be right back, my brother.

17:33.026 --> 17:35.826
This, is, uh,
seriously yak butter?

17:35.828 --> 17:37.297
You like it?

17:38.865 --> 17:41.365
- I actually do.
- Fuck yeah.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.904
Just wait till you see
how it makes you feel, my man.

17:55.348 --> 17:57.480
<i>Please enter a destination.</i>

17:57.482 --> 17:58.982
Yo, is there a way
to shut that thing up?

17:58.984 --> 18:01.618
It's just gonna keep saying
that every 15 minutes.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.354
Well, that fucking sucks.

18:03.356 --> 18:07.325
All right, Bruno,
where are we headed?

18:07.327 --> 18:08.959
I want to see if I can crash

18:08.961 --> 18:11.494
with a buddy
at Wilshire and Westlake.

18:11.496 --> 18:13.364
Okay, well, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

18:13.366 --> 18:15.098
I have no idea where that is.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.599
Dude, shouldn't you know
this city

18:16.601 --> 18:17.903
like the back
of your fucking hand?

18:19.771 --> 18:22.506
- I can Maps it.
- I'm fucking with you.

18:22.508 --> 18:24.508
East on Wilshire
past MacArthur Park.

18:24.510 --> 18:25.910
I'll be your Sherpa.

18:25.912 --> 18:28.045
MacArthur Park.
Isn't that a little sketchy?

18:28.047 --> 18:30.448
What can I say?
I hang out with sketchy people.

18:30.450 --> 18:34.085
<i>You're tuned in
to 81.3, the Voice of L.A.</i>

18:34.087 --> 18:37.387
- All right.
- So, dude, what's your story?

18:37.389 --> 18:39.856
I mean, what do you do?

18:39.858 --> 18:42.460
I drive for Ryde.

18:42.462 --> 18:45.395
No, that's what you're doing.
Nobody wants to do that.

18:45.397 --> 18:47.932
- Thanks.
- Don't pretend you're offended.

18:47.934 --> 18:50.567
People don't get offended
by the truth.

18:50.569 --> 18:51.836
You gonna sit there
and lie to me,

18:51.838 --> 18:53.674
or are you gonna
tell me who you are?

18:55.540 --> 18:57.444
I'm an actor, man.

19:00.113 --> 19:01.912
Fuck, that's so L.A.

19:01.914 --> 19:04.147
Of course you're an actor.

19:04.149 --> 19:06.683
Jesus, that's awful.

19:06.685 --> 19:08.986
No, no, no. No.
Don't take it like that.

19:08.988 --> 19:10.820
I'm sure you're amazing.

19:10.822 --> 19:16.126
I'm just saying this world,
you know, we take our artists,

19:16.128 --> 19:18.464
and we make them drive our cars.

19:20.700 --> 19:21.867
Stage or screen?

19:23.001 --> 19:25.836
Yo, you just told me you want to
perform for a living.

19:25.838 --> 19:27.404
Don't clam up now.

19:27.406 --> 19:29.673
Well, I went to school
for theater,

19:29.675 --> 19:33.411
but I'm here auditioning for TV.

19:33.413 --> 19:36.480
Commercials. Whatever.

19:36.482 --> 19:39.583
You're a thespian.
Master thespian.

19:40.853 --> 19:42.787
You got any monologues
you can reel off?

19:42.789 --> 19:44.922
- Come on, man.
- I'm not fucking with you.

19:44.924 --> 19:46.990
I legitimately love theater.

19:46.992 --> 19:50.461
And there's never anything
good out here.

19:50.463 --> 19:53.431
- You know Shakespeare?
- I might've heard of him.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.465
- Do a monologue.
- No.

19:55.467 --> 19:57.902
Dude, do a monologue.

19:57.904 --> 19:59.636
I am not about to reel off

19:59.638 --> 20:01.605
a Shakespearean monologue
right now.

20:01.607 --> 20:03.641
Okay.

20:03.643 --> 20:07.010
That's okay.
I can respect that.

20:07.012 --> 20:09.078
- 50 bucks.
- What?

20:09.080 --> 20:11.048
I am going to pay you
an extra $50

20:11.050 --> 20:14.453
to do a monologue
from Shakespeare.

20:16.489 --> 20:17.855
A hundred.

20:17.857 --> 20:19.623
Do not fuck with me right now.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.692
Dead serious.
A hundred bucks.

20:21.694 --> 20:23.126
Think of it as a favor to me.

20:23.128 --> 20:25.729
And do "Richard III."
It's my favorite.

20:25.731 --> 20:27.798
Well, I don't know
"Richard III."

20:27.800 --> 20:29.732
Okay.

20:29.734 --> 20:31.067
I know "Richard II."

20:31.069 --> 20:33.103
Fuck yeah!
Now we're fucking talking.

20:33.105 --> 20:36.610
- Let's hear that shit!
- Ah!

20:44.750 --> 20:47.218
Huh.

20:47.220 --> 20:50.019
Let's talk of graves,

20:50.021 --> 20:53.156
of worms and epitaphs,

20:53.158 --> 20:57.760
make dust our paper
and with rainy eyes write sorrow

20:57.762 --> 20:59.663
on the bosom of the earth.

20:59.665 --> 21:04.201
Let's choose executors,
talk of wills,

21:04.203 --> 21:06.936
and yet not so,
for what can we bequeath

21:06.938 --> 21:09.874
save our deposed bodies
to the ground?

21:09.876 --> 21:14.744
Our land, our lives,
and all are Bolingbroke's,

21:14.746 --> 21:17.714
and nothing can we call our own
but death.

21:17.716 --> 21:20.917
For God's sake,
let us sit upon the ground

21:20.919 --> 21:23.520
and tell sad stories
of the death of kings.

21:23.522 --> 21:26.155
For within the hollow crown
that rounds

21:26.157 --> 21:30.027
the mortal temples of a king
keeps Death his court,

21:30.029 --> 21:34.030
infusing him with self
and vain conceit,

21:34.032 --> 21:38.067
as if this flesh
which walls about our life

21:38.069 --> 21:40.170
were brass impregnable,

21:40.172 --> 21:44.240
and humored thus
comes at the last

21:44.242 --> 21:50.748
with a little pin bore through
his castle walls, farewell king.

21:50.750 --> 21:54.919
Cover your heads
and mock not flesh and blood

21:54.921 --> 21:56.720
with solemn reverence...

21:56.722 --> 21:59.923
throw away respect
and tradition,

21:59.925 --> 22:03.794
form, ceremonious duty,

22:03.796 --> 22:07.298
for you have but mistook me
all this while...

22:07.300 --> 22:10.200
I live with bread like you,

22:10.202 --> 22:14.038
feel want, taste grief,

22:14.040 --> 22:19.676
need friends,
and subjected thus,

22:19.678 --> 22:22.248
how can you say to me,
I am a king?

22:30.021 --> 22:31.689
You <i>are</i> a king.

22:31.691 --> 22:34.057
You're the fucking king, man.

22:34.059 --> 22:37.994
Oh, you should be booking all
over the place with that shit.

22:37.996 --> 22:39.963
It's money well spent.

22:39.965 --> 22:42.732
Wow.

22:42.734 --> 22:44.768
I don't know what to say, man.
You liked it?

22:44.770 --> 22:46.202
I liked it?

22:46.204 --> 22:48.806
You're an artist.

22:48.808 --> 22:50.807
That shit comes from the heart.

22:50.809 --> 22:53.810
That means a whole lot
to hear you say that, man.

22:53.812 --> 22:55.613
That one's
kind of close to me.

22:55.615 --> 22:57.914
Like, I used it
to audition for school.

22:57.916 --> 23:00.084
This is gonna sound dumb,
but when I think about

23:00.086 --> 23:02.251
like what it is that
I really want out of life,

23:02.253 --> 23:06.957
I just, I don't want to die
having not played Richard II.

23:06.959 --> 23:09.226
- Broadway?
- Any stage will do.

23:11.262 --> 23:14.163
Okay, I hate to be that asshole
who asks,

23:14.165 --> 23:16.700
"Have I seen you in anything?"
but...

23:16.702 --> 23:18.769
But would I have
seen you in anything?

23:18.771 --> 23:21.771
Uh, well,

23:21.773 --> 23:25.976
I did this, uh, guest spot
on "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

23:25.978 --> 23:28.112
- No fucking way.
- Yeah.

23:28.114 --> 23:29.413
I bet you were
the supervillain.

23:29.415 --> 23:31.981
No.
I was a henchman.

23:31.983 --> 23:35.419
I haven't graduated
to supervillain yet.

23:35.421 --> 23:38.058
Well, we'll get you there,
buddy.

23:45.764 --> 23:48.865
All right,
halfway up the block.

23:48.867 --> 23:51.000
Okay, just pull up right here.

23:51.002 --> 23:53.836
All right, here.

23:53.838 --> 23:56.973
Uh, flashers off. Just chill.
I'll be like two minutes.

23:56.975 --> 24:00.076
You mind killing the lights,
leaving the engine on?

24:00.078 --> 24:01.811
Okay.
Is everything all right?

24:01.813 --> 24:04.248
Totally. It's just
a sketchy neighborhood.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.182
I get nervous.

24:06.184 --> 24:08.786
So you want me to just, like,
just wait here for a second?

24:08.788 --> 24:10.688
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I just need to see

24:10.690 --> 24:12.388
if my buddy's home
and if I can crash with him.

24:12.390 --> 24:14.191
If not, I might need to roll
somewhere else.

24:14.193 --> 24:15.962
You mind waiting?
Is that cool?

24:17.896 --> 24:20.963
- Yeah, man. It's cool.
- Thank God.

24:20.965 --> 24:23.032
What are the chances
I could ever find another James?

24:23.034 --> 24:24.233
Slim to none.

24:24.235 --> 24:26.336
Slim to none.
I hate those odds.

24:26.338 --> 24:28.707
- Thanks, dude.
- All right, man.

24:43.455 --> 24:45.288
Hello?

24:45.290 --> 24:46.990
Hey, man.

24:46.992 --> 24:49.759
No, I'm... I'm good.
I'm all good.

24:49.761 --> 24:54.230
Yeah. I'm sure
it's pretty late for you.

24:54.232 --> 24:55.965
It has been a while.

24:55.967 --> 24:59.970
Uh, I'm... I'm driving for Ryde.
Yeah.

24:59.972 --> 25:01.505
Hey, listen, I actually wanted
to ask you something.

25:03.108 --> 25:04.907
Hey, hang on
for a second, Jason.

25:12.851 --> 25:15.184
Yeah, I'm here.
My bad.

25:15.186 --> 25:18.154
Um, yeah, when you were...
when you were driving,

25:18.156 --> 25:21.759
did anybody ever ask you out?

25:21.761 --> 25:24.994
Yeah, like a girl, man.

25:28.166 --> 25:32.836
Yeah, she was beautiful,
and we just... we hit it off.

25:32.838 --> 25:35.471
Well, I guess I wouldn't
be asking about it,

25:35.473 --> 25:38.008
but I... I guess
I'm still thinking about her.

25:38.010 --> 25:40.277
Shit.

25:40.279 --> 25:43.079
Uh, yeah, well, let me...
let me call you back actually.

25:43.081 --> 25:44.948
Nah, don't worry about it.

25:44.950 --> 25:46.016
Oh.

25:46.018 --> 25:47.416
Uh, yeah.

25:47.418 --> 25:49.553
All right.
Talk to you soon. Bye.

25:49.555 --> 25:51.555
All right, let's get
the fuck out of dodge.

25:51.557 --> 25:53.760
All right.
Let's do it.

25:55.293 --> 25:57.326
Can you please do that
from the road?

25:57.328 --> 26:00.300
- Uh, sure.
- Trying to make moves.

26:01.267 --> 26:03.299
No problem.

26:06.238 --> 26:10.374
<i>Up next, a local band
with a vintage sound.</i>

26:10.376 --> 26:12.009
<i>These guys
have been taking over...</i>

26:12.011 --> 26:15.479
So what's up, man?
Was your buddy not home or what?

26:15.481 --> 26:18.917
Uh, yeah, he wasn't...
he wasn't there.

26:20.051 --> 26:22.286
Park's beautiful
this time of night.

26:22.288 --> 26:26.123
No, I mean, it's filled
with homeless drug addicts,

26:26.125 --> 26:27.958
but it's beautiful nonetheless.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.528
Where are we headed?

26:31.530 --> 26:35.535
Uh, just keep heading west.
I'll figure it out.

26:37.536 --> 26:39.873
Yo, you know you've got
something on your shirt?

26:40.606 --> 26:42.405
Oh, shit.

26:42.407 --> 26:45.342
Ah, I used to get these
fucking nosebleeds as a kid,

26:45.344 --> 26:47.477
and the cold weather
brings them back.

26:47.479 --> 26:50.079
- Here, you want a tissue?
- No, I'm good, I'm good.

26:50.081 --> 26:51.882
- You sure?
- Yeah.

26:51.884 --> 26:52.952
All right.

26:54.919 --> 26:57.287
Yo, Bruno,
when we were back there,

26:57.289 --> 26:59.189
did you hear something weird?

26:59.191 --> 27:02.259
Pff, dude, it's MacArthur Park.

27:02.261 --> 27:05.628
Neighborhood is nothing <i>but</i>
weird noises.

27:05.630 --> 27:08.932
- I'm from out here actually.
- Where? From MacArthur Park?

27:08.934 --> 27:11.634
No. I'm a L.A. native, though.
There are fewer and fewer of us.

27:11.636 --> 27:15.873
We're a dying breed.
Like unicorns or some shit.

27:18.309 --> 27:21.310
Hey, uh, I want to apologize
for earlier,

27:21.312 --> 27:22.346
making you miss your thing.

27:22.348 --> 27:24.280
- What thing?
- Thing.

27:24.282 --> 27:26.415
The thing you had to do
an hour after you picked me up.

27:26.417 --> 27:28.085
Oh! It's funny.

27:28.087 --> 27:31.320
Nah, I'd forgotten
all about that.

27:31.322 --> 27:34.924
Well sincerely, thank you
for missing it, whatever it was.

27:34.926 --> 27:36.195
No problem.

27:38.396 --> 27:40.029
What was it?

27:40.031 --> 27:43.133
- Ah, it wasn't important.
- Oh, shit.

27:43.135 --> 27:45.571
That means it definitely
was important. What was it?

27:47.106 --> 27:48.404
Just this girl.

27:48.406 --> 27:51.307
- Fuck me! Just this girl?
- Oh, don't do that.

27:51.309 --> 27:53.343
- There are no three words...
- Come on.

27:53.345 --> 27:56.078
...in the contemporary
English language more telling,

27:56.080 --> 28:00.517
more loaded, more fucking epic
in scope than "just this girl."

28:00.519 --> 28:03.086
Fucking take that,
William Shakespeare!

28:03.088 --> 28:06.323
Yo, it's... it's really not
that big of a deal, bro.

28:06.325 --> 28:08.357
Give me the details. I'll tell
you if it was a big deal.

28:08.359 --> 28:11.929
All right,
so before I picked you up,

28:11.931 --> 28:13.230
like, I had my first fare
of the night,

28:13.232 --> 28:14.263
and it was this girl.

28:14.265 --> 28:15.632
Oh, this girl.

28:15.634 --> 28:18.669
So, like, I prepare myself
for the usual,

28:18.671 --> 28:20.703
you know, try to turn
the awkward conversation

28:20.705 --> 28:22.239
into witty banter.

28:22.241 --> 28:24.641
But this time
it's a little different.

28:24.643 --> 28:27.144
- You got a picture.
- What?

28:27.146 --> 28:29.512
- On the app, man.
- No, that's creeping, bro.

28:29.514 --> 28:31.248
- That's unethical.
- What are you talking about?

28:31.250 --> 28:33.482
What's unethical
is to get me this interested

28:33.484 --> 28:35.384
and not let me know
what she looks like.

28:35.386 --> 28:37.354
"Previous fare."

28:37.356 --> 28:39.556
Yo.

28:39.558 --> 28:40.958
- What the fuck, dude?
- See that?

28:40.960 --> 28:42.425
I know, right?
Look.

28:42.427 --> 28:45.328
All right, man, that's enough.

28:45.330 --> 28:49.566
Anyway, so, like, I really liked
talking to this girl.

28:49.568 --> 28:52.234
You know what I mean?
She was just no bullshit.

28:52.236 --> 28:53.569
Like, she even made this joke

28:53.571 --> 28:56.405
about how everyone in L.A.
drives drunk.

28:56.407 --> 28:58.008
Uh, she's not wrong.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.544
Well, yeah, but anyways,
at the end of the ride,

29:00.546 --> 29:02.511
she invites me
to come meet up with her

29:02.513 --> 29:04.513
and her friends for some drinks.

29:04.515 --> 29:07.651
Oh, man, that's the dream, dude.

29:07.653 --> 29:10.420
Cabbie gets asked out
by a hot passenger.

29:10.422 --> 29:12.756
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, man.

29:12.758 --> 29:15.124
Yeah.

29:15.126 --> 29:17.126
Then what the fuck
are you doing here with me?

29:17.128 --> 29:21.030
Well, uh, I needed
to make some money.

29:21.032 --> 29:24.201
Yo, tell me
you got her number.

29:24.203 --> 29:26.269
Ohh...

29:26.271 --> 29:28.538
She got away, like,
right before I could.

29:28.540 --> 29:31.008
Oh, bullshit.
You hesitated.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.410
I did not hesitate.

29:35.313 --> 29:36.982
I hesitated.

29:38.317 --> 29:39.682
Let's go.

29:39.684 --> 29:41.484
Where to next, man?

29:41.486 --> 29:44.421
- The bar, man.
- What do you mean, the bar?

29:44.423 --> 29:46.222
The bar where the girl said
she was gonna be.

29:46.224 --> 29:47.758
- Where was it?
- No! We don't need to do that.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.126
Dude, you caught feelings.
We got to go!

29:50.128 --> 29:52.328
No, it was like
this little passing moment...

29:52.330 --> 29:54.397
James, I am not gonna be
the force in your life

29:54.399 --> 29:57.366
that prevents you from hanging
out with this girl tonight.

29:57.368 --> 29:59.435
I mean, who knows, man,
maybe you're meant...

29:59.437 --> 30:02.138
meant to kiss her tonight.

30:02.140 --> 30:05.241
Maybe you're meant
to fuck her tonight.

30:05.243 --> 30:07.109
Maybe you're meant
to knock this girl up,

30:07.111 --> 30:09.278
and nine months from now
you marry her

30:09.280 --> 30:10.614
to appease her parents,

30:10.616 --> 30:13.316
and I'm the best man
at your fucking wedding.

30:13.318 --> 30:18.188
Wow. Uh, I'm gonna pass
on that last part.

30:18.190 --> 30:20.524
All right,
well, I'm offended by that.

30:20.526 --> 30:23.059
But this girl is gonna be
more offended

30:23.061 --> 30:24.326
if you don't show up tonight.

30:24.328 --> 30:25.595
She's counting on you.

30:25.597 --> 30:28.330
Bro, she could not have
actually thought

30:28.332 --> 30:30.200
- that I was gonna come.
- Are you kidding?

30:30.202 --> 30:31.667
What world do you live in

30:31.669 --> 30:33.702
where a girl
invites a guy somewhere

30:33.704 --> 30:35.538
she doesn't actually
want him to be?

30:35.540 --> 30:37.740
That does not happen.

30:37.742 --> 30:41.310
Right now she is in there
making a conversation,

30:41.312 --> 30:43.413
faking a fucking laugh
here and there.

30:43.415 --> 30:44.815
"Ha ha! Ha ha. Ha."

30:44.817 --> 30:48.285
But all the while
she's glancing back at the door.

30:48.287 --> 30:50.820
And in the back of her mind,
she's waiting for someone...

30:50.822 --> 30:52.588
- Come on, bro.
- ...to walk through that door.

30:52.590 --> 30:55.157
That someone is you, homey.

30:55.159 --> 30:57.227
That someone is you!

30:57.229 --> 31:01.397
<i>Up next is a song

31:01.399 --> 31:05.669
<i>♪ Feel a change

31:05.671 --> 31:09.372
<i>♪ It's a brand-new day ♪</i>

31:18.649 --> 31:21.250
Oh, we're too late.
Look... Look at this line.

31:21.252 --> 31:23.252
Just tell them
you're with Bruno Anthony.

31:23.254 --> 31:25.255
You're kidding.

31:25.257 --> 31:28.325
Dude, trust me.
All right, here's the plan.

31:28.327 --> 31:30.393
You run in, walk straight
up to her, no hesitation.

31:30.395 --> 31:33.529
You say a polite hello to her
friends and then ignore them.

31:33.531 --> 31:37.634
And then, very directly,
you ask her if she wants to come

31:37.636 --> 31:40.871
with you and a buddy... me...
to a house party in Malibu.

31:40.873 --> 31:44.907
A little kickback, a few brews,
a fucking hot tub.

31:44.909 --> 31:46.276
She'll never go for that.

31:46.278 --> 31:48.878
Tell her that sometimes

31:48.880 --> 31:51.748
when we trust our impulses,

31:51.750 --> 31:54.384
incredible things can happen.

31:54.386 --> 31:56.353
I'm a total stranger.

31:56.355 --> 32:01.527
Well, a stranger is just
a friend you haven't met yet.

32:05.931 --> 32:07.797
We're going to a hot tub
in Malibu?

32:07.799 --> 32:09.766
You are goddamn right we are.

32:09.768 --> 32:11.771
Now get in there and bring back
a beautiful woman.

32:15.507 --> 32:18.275
- It's a tow-away zone.
- Just leave the keys with me.

32:18.277 --> 32:19.675
What do you think, I'm crazy?

32:19.677 --> 32:21.577
Dude, I couldn't do anything
if I wanted to.

32:21.579 --> 32:25.350
The app has my card number.
It'd charge me for a car.

32:27.685 --> 32:28.785
Okay, here's a bet.

32:28.787 --> 32:30.753
If you can pull this off,

32:30.755 --> 32:33.557
I'll be your chauffeur
for the rest of the night.

32:36.761 --> 32:37.961
Done.

32:37.963 --> 32:40.497
All right.

32:40.499 --> 32:42.598
You want me to see if she has
like a hot friend or something?

32:42.600 --> 32:46.204
Absolutely not.
This night is about you.

33:24.742 --> 33:25.909
I don't know if you saw,

33:25.911 --> 33:27.844
but there's a little bit
of a line.

33:27.846 --> 33:29.679
Uh, I'm meeting Bruno Anthony.

33:29.681 --> 33:31.548
Why didn't you say so?
Go ahead.

33:31.550 --> 33:33.519
And tell him I say hi.

34:15.659 --> 34:18.627
Hi! Wow!
You finally came.

34:18.629 --> 34:20.763
I did not think
you were gonna show.

34:20.764 --> 34:23.368
Oh, it's been
a super bizarre night.

34:36.647 --> 34:39.415
- You want a drink?
- I'm actually still working.

34:39.417 --> 34:41.817
Oh.
Then why'd you come?

34:41.819 --> 34:44.422
I really liked talking to you.

34:45.723 --> 34:50.396
Uh, I really liked
talking to you too.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.500
I mean, the last thing I want

34:57.502 --> 34:59.502
is to be one of those
smarmy Ryde guys

34:59.504 --> 35:00.803
who, like, manages
to get a number.

35:00.805 --> 35:03.740
No, no, I don't think
you're smarmy.

35:03.742 --> 35:06.375
So I made
a good first impression.

35:06.377 --> 35:08.814
Mm.

35:10.948 --> 35:14.551
<i>Hello, James.
Please enter a destination.</i>

35:14.553 --> 35:18.087
So I made a buddy tonight.

35:18.089 --> 35:20.622
He invited me
to this party in Malibu

35:20.624 --> 35:23.727
with some drinks,
a little music.

35:23.729 --> 35:25.895
- Apparently there's a hot tub.
- Ooh.

35:25.897 --> 35:27.767
And I want you to come.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.303
A buddy?

35:36.107 --> 35:37.674
Yeah, his girl left him,

35:37.676 --> 35:39.542
and he's kind of
piecing things back together,

35:39.544 --> 35:40.642
but he seems chill.

35:40.644 --> 35:42.712
Um...

35:42.714 --> 35:44.848
I thought it might be
a little weird,

35:44.850 --> 35:46.415
me coming back here
to see you,

35:46.417 --> 35:48.852
but sometimes when you trust
your impulses,

35:48.854 --> 35:50.656
incredible things can happen.

35:51.722 --> 35:54.723
So where did you say
that party was at, again?

35:54.725 --> 35:56.692
<i>We'll be keeping

35:56.694 --> 36:00.098

Dude!
Where's your car?

36:37.568 --> 36:39.067
That's not fucking cool, Bruno.

36:39.069 --> 36:40.904
Cops were gonna tow you,
brother. I had to make a call.

36:40.906 --> 36:42.571
That's fucking bullshit, man.

36:42.573 --> 36:45.741
Dude, look over there.

36:45.743 --> 36:48.845
- Oh, fuck me.
- A thank-you would be nice.

36:48.847 --> 36:51.113
Hey.
Is this your friend?

36:51.115 --> 36:53.616
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, this is him.

36:53.618 --> 36:56.051
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:00.658 --> 37:03.091
Oh, shit, I love this song.

37:03.093 --> 37:05.194
This is a mix.

37:05.196 --> 37:07.095
James still burns mix CDs.

37:07.097 --> 37:08.865
My phone doesn't connect.

37:08.867 --> 37:10.799
That's fucking adorable.

37:10.801 --> 37:12.968
So, uh, for those of us
without an app,

37:12.970 --> 37:14.571
what is your name, my dear?

37:14.573 --> 37:16.605
Oh, how rude of me.

37:16.607 --> 37:17.841
- I'm Jess.
- How rude indeed.

37:17.843 --> 37:20.075
Jess.
What a pleasure.

37:20.077 --> 37:23.078
Wow, so fancy and formal.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.781
Nice to meet you, Bruno A.?

37:25.783 --> 37:27.183
Bruno A.
That's me.

37:27.185 --> 37:29.519
All the names in the book

37:29.521 --> 37:32.020
your parents
could have went with,

37:32.022 --> 37:33.823
they went with Bruno?

37:33.825 --> 37:36.058
Beg your pardon!
Bruno's a sweet name.

37:36.060 --> 37:39.828
Yo, I'm sorry, man, but I
thought the exact same thing.

37:39.830 --> 37:43.066
Oh, backstabber.
True colors, James.

37:43.068 --> 37:46.703
Wait, James, why didn't you
tell me your friend was a ride?

37:46.705 --> 37:48.104
Yeah, what the fuck, James?

37:48.106 --> 37:49.805
- What the fuck, James?
- You didn't ask!

37:49.807 --> 37:51.908
Dude, I told you
to lead with that.

37:51.910 --> 37:53.977
- Whatever. It's all equal now.
- What do you mean?

37:53.979 --> 37:57.080
Well, you were a ride,
and now we're all best friends.

37:57.082 --> 38:01.116
Yeah, see, a stranger is just a
friend that you haven't met yet.

38:01.118 --> 38:03.051
Wow, this has got to
win the prize

38:03.053 --> 38:05.988
for the most unintentionally
creepy marketing campaign

38:05.990 --> 38:07.890
I have ever heard.

38:07.892 --> 38:09.158
But you're still
gonna use the app.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.660
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.

38:10.662 --> 38:13.029
Hey!
Aw, Bruno...

38:13.031 --> 38:14.997
What's up, Jess?
Talk to me, girl.

38:14.999 --> 38:16.698
I don't mean to be that person,

38:16.700 --> 38:18.734
but do you mind
if I have a drag of that?

38:18.736 --> 38:20.102
- Jess.
- Yes?

38:20.104 --> 38:22.071
You're a self-loathing smoker.

38:22.073 --> 38:24.207
- Ugh.
- If you want a cig, have a cig.

38:24.209 --> 38:25.741
Just don't apologize for it.

38:25.743 --> 38:27.676
Now these are New York cigs,

38:27.678 --> 38:29.279
so they're basically
worth their weight in gold.

38:29.281 --> 38:30.879
- Yo, Bruno...
- I know what you're thinking.

38:30.881 --> 38:32.314
I could probably just get
the same fucking...

38:32.316 --> 38:34.250
- Bruno.
- What is it, James?

38:34.252 --> 38:35.852
Can't smoke in my car.

38:35.854 --> 38:37.553
Yo, I would not dream of it.

38:37.555 --> 38:39.622
I know. You told me before.
I absolutely wouldn't.

38:39.624 --> 38:41.024
Jess is gonna smoke
in your car,

38:41.026 --> 38:42.292
and you're gonna
be cool about it.

38:42.294 --> 38:44.093
No, no, no.
I really didn't mean...

38:44.095 --> 38:46.062
Jess, don't worry about it.
We're gonna crack a window.

38:46.064 --> 38:48.031
He's gonna be tight.

38:48.033 --> 38:50.633
Yo, look at this.
End of Fountain.

38:50.635 --> 38:52.000
Bette Davis,
you've done us well.

38:52.002 --> 38:54.169
- Oh, boy.
- Ho! Wait a minute.

38:54.171 --> 38:55.571
I think I got you right there,
my man.

38:55.573 --> 38:56.906
Here we go.

38:56.908 --> 38:58.607
That was Mae West that said,
"Take Fountain."

38:58.609 --> 38:59.908
No, no, no.
That's bullshit.

38:59.910 --> 39:01.910
Uh, no, I swear.
That's a Mae West quote.

39:01.912 --> 39:03.779
Yo, you should know this.
You're an actor.

39:03.781 --> 39:06.749
- He told me this story earlier.
- He told it to you wrong.

39:06.751 --> 39:08.817
Honestly, I thought
you were a weirdo.

39:08.819 --> 39:10.587
Oh, really?

39:10.589 --> 39:11.921
So weird that you invited me
to the bar.

39:11.923 --> 39:14.591
Why do you think
I invited you to the bar?

39:14.593 --> 39:16.758
Yes, because we're all
beautiful fucking weirdos.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.729
But the point is
it's Bette Davis.

39:19.731 --> 39:21.930
- I'll bet you anything.
- I don't need to fucking bet.

39:21.932 --> 39:24.633
If you're so confident,
look it up.

39:24.635 --> 39:25.801
- Should I?
- Please do.

39:25.803 --> 39:27.069
- Yes? Okay!
- Pull out a phone.

39:27.071 --> 39:28.337
- Oh, my gosh.
- We're looking it up.

39:28.339 --> 39:30.173
- The moment of truth.
- Bated breath.

39:30.175 --> 39:32.207
Honestly, James, I don't mean
to offend you, but...

39:32.209 --> 39:33.910
What?

39:33.912 --> 39:36.145
Bruno just sounds more
convincing when he says it.

39:36.147 --> 39:38.214
Yeah, liars always do.

39:38.216 --> 39:40.116
It's loading.
Hold on.

39:40.118 --> 39:42.151
Tell him.

39:42.153 --> 39:44.053
- Sorry, James.
- Oh, suck it, James.

39:44.055 --> 39:45.787
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

39:45.789 --> 39:47.290
"The legend has it that
when the famous Bette Davis

39:47.292 --> 39:49.024
was being interviewed
on a talk show,

39:49.026 --> 39:50.859
she was asked what advice
she had for actors

39:50.861 --> 39:52.028
trying to make it
in Hollywood.

39:52.030 --> 39:54.196
Her response, "Take Fountain,"

39:54.198 --> 39:57.200
according to
TakeFountainBlog.Wordpress.com.

39:57.202 --> 39:59.836

No, no, no, no, no.

40:01.772 --> 40:03.171
I-I demand a recount.

40:03.173 --> 40:05.375

we didn't bet, dawg.

40:05.377 --> 40:07.310

40:10.314 --> 40:12.147
Holy shit!
You got a good voice.

40:12.149 --> 40:13.716
Oh, thank you so much.

40:13.718 --> 40:15.350
I think music, you know,

40:15.352 --> 40:17.220
is the way that all of us
human beings

40:17.222 --> 40:18.388
were meant
to express ourselves.

40:18.390 --> 40:19.888
Yes!

40:19.890 --> 40:21.323
I mean, without a voice,
what have you got?

40:21.325 --> 40:23.660
No, seriously.
I mean, I-I'm a singer.

40:23.662 --> 40:27.129
I mean, I'm not, like, a <i>singer.</i>
You know, I sing, but...

40:27.131 --> 40:30.799
Jess, I knew that about you
the moment I met you.

40:30.801 --> 40:32.067
- Really?
- I swear to God.

40:32.069 --> 40:33.803
No way. Aw!

40:33.805 --> 40:36.339
Okay, hey, Bruno, could you
slow down a little bit?

40:36.341 --> 40:38.207
Sure. Watch this!

40:38.209 --> 40:39.941
Whoa!
What the hell, man?

40:39.943 --> 40:43.680
Construction zone?
What the fuck?

40:43.682 --> 40:45.314
You guys should dance.

40:45.316 --> 40:46.683
What?

40:46.685 --> 40:47.917
- James.
- Here?

40:47.919 --> 40:52.055
Ask her to dance
right here, right now.

40:52.057 --> 40:53.423
Oh, come on, it's not like

40:53.425 --> 40:55.957
you're gonna look back
at this night and regret

40:55.959 --> 40:57.993
dancing in the middle
of Avenue of the Stars

40:57.995 --> 40:59.227
on your first date.

40:59.229 --> 41:04.066
Oh!
Is this our first date, James?

41:04.068 --> 41:06.703
In that case,
you'd better ask me to dance.

41:06.705 --> 41:08.437
I think I'm gonna have to
take down my hair for this.

41:08.439 --> 41:10.138
She's taking down her hair,
James.

a pretty good dancer.

41:40.872 --> 41:42.437

41:42.439 --> 41:44.042

41:48.046 --> 41:49.415
Unh!

41:54.017 --> 41:55.884
All right, here.
You ready?

41:58.823 --> 42:00.089
Jess, give me your phone.

42:00.091 --> 42:01.390
This is too good.
I got to get it.

42:01.392 --> 42:02.792
It's in the backseat.

42:02.794 --> 42:04.761
Yep.
Wait, Jess.

42:04.763 --> 42:06.928
- Run and jump into my arms.
- What?

42:06.930 --> 42:08.330
- Run and jump into my arms!
- No!

42:08.332 --> 42:10.031
Hurry up before we get arrested!

42:10.033 --> 42:11.334
- Come on.
- Nooo!

42:11.336 --> 42:13.205
Go!

42:16.073 --> 42:17.809
Oh, my God.

42:19.042 --> 42:21.243
That wasn't so bad, right?

42:21.245 --> 42:23.212
Hey, if this were a movie,

42:23.214 --> 42:24.814
the sprinklers would come on
right now,

42:24.816 --> 42:26.848
and y'all would kiss
in that fake L.A. rain.

42:28.019 --> 42:29.484
Get out of here, man.

42:29.486 --> 42:30.886
You want to get a drink?

42:30.888 --> 42:32.988
Oh, I love
where your head's at.

42:32.990 --> 42:34.156
- I know the spot.
- Whoo!

42:34.158 --> 42:35.991
- Right nearby.
- Let's get some alcohol!

42:35.993 --> 42:38.828
Get out of here.

42:38.830 --> 42:43.064
- So ready for a drink.
- Oh, man.

42:43.066 --> 42:45.901
Wait, so this is the spot?

42:45.903 --> 42:48.236
Yes, this is the spot, Jess.

42:48.238 --> 42:51.941
Look, uh, bottle's on me,
but I could also use some cash.

42:51.943 --> 42:54.977
James, do you mind
going in for me?

42:54.979 --> 42:57.013
I'd prefer if you did it, bro.

42:57.015 --> 42:59.214
Why? You don't trust me
with your lady?

42:59.216 --> 43:01.417
Oh, "your lady"?

43:01.419 --> 43:04.086
One dance,
and I'm already your lady?

43:04.088 --> 43:06.354
- I'm working on it.
- Look, just show them this.

43:06.356 --> 43:08.924
They'll give you
anything you want.

43:08.926 --> 43:12.194
Get some old fucking
blended shit and $500.

43:12.196 --> 43:13.462
Please.

43:13.464 --> 43:15.598
What the fuck, man?

43:15.600 --> 43:17.566
Put that shit away!

43:17.568 --> 43:19.267
Okay, you know what?

43:19.269 --> 43:21.837
If you don't, your new friend
in the back's night

43:21.839 --> 43:24.006
is gonna take
a slight turn for the worse.

43:24.008 --> 43:26.174
Don't point that
fucking thing at her.

43:26.176 --> 43:28.477
Did you ever see
what a .44 Magnum

43:28.479 --> 43:30.412
could do to a woman's face?

43:30.414 --> 43:34.383
It'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

43:34.385 --> 43:37.019
That's what I could do
to her face.

43:37.021 --> 43:40.223
Now did you ever see what it
could do to a woman's pussy?

43:40.225 --> 43:42.892
Now, that you should see.

43:42.894 --> 43:45.861
That you should see,
what... what a .44 Magnum

43:45.863 --> 43:49.467
is gonna do to a woman's pussy,
you should see.

43:54.539 --> 43:57.506
I'm fucking
with you.

43:57.508 --> 44:00.176
It's from "Taxi Driver."

44:00.178 --> 44:01.410
Thank you.

44:01.412 --> 44:03.912
Oh, you should've seen
your faces.

44:05.582 --> 44:07.549
Jess, the child locks are on.

44:07.551 --> 44:09.120
Goddamn it.

44:11.055 --> 44:13.189
Bruno, tell me
that that's not real.

44:13.191 --> 44:16.328
Dude, take a look.

44:19.430 --> 44:23.131
Now, if you don't want to come
back to a car full of dead girl,

44:23.133 --> 44:25.903
I suggest you get a move on.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.980
Whoa-hoa-hoa.

44:38.982 --> 44:41.283
I don't know who you are or what
the fuck you think you're doing,

44:41.285 --> 44:43.451
but it's time for you to get
the fuck out of my car!

44:43.453 --> 44:45.154
- Aah!
- James!

44:45.156 --> 44:47.593
Ah! Shit!

44:49.093 --> 44:51.459
- Open your mouth.
- Oh, fuck!

44:51.461 --> 44:53.129
James, if you don't
open your mouth,

44:53.131 --> 44:55.064
I'm gonna shoot you,

44:55.066 --> 44:58.203
and then I'm going to shoot her
with the gun still in your hand.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.372
And the next time
you point a gun at someone,

45:04.374 --> 45:07.243
you better be very fucking sure
you can pull the trigger,

45:07.245 --> 45:11.314
because if you hesitate,
somebody's gonna fucking die,

45:11.316 --> 45:13.049
and it's not gonna be
fucking me!

45:13.051 --> 45:14.586
Let him go.

45:15.986 --> 45:17.520
He'll do it.

45:17.522 --> 45:19.625
Okay.

45:23.694 --> 45:27.999
I like old blended whiskeys,
and I like $50 bills.

45:51.356 --> 45:53.122
Don't you fucking move!

45:53.124 --> 45:54.660
Hold on. Wait a minute, dude.
You got this all wrong.

45:56.294 --> 45:59.361
It's okay, Jess.
I got your phone.

45:59.363 --> 46:01.596
Can you just
take the car and... and go?

46:01.598 --> 46:04.500
I'm not gonna say anything.
James isn't gonna say either.

46:04.502 --> 46:06.301
Jess, be quiet.
You're missing the movie.

46:06.303 --> 46:08.738
Wait, wait, wait.
I need you to listen, please!

46:08.740 --> 46:10.605
- Put the fucking gun down!
- I need you to call the police!

46:10.607 --> 46:12.544
I'll fucking kill you, man!

46:13.577 --> 46:15.146
Fuck.

46:18.149 --> 46:19.415
Uh, how...

46:19.417 --> 46:21.316
It's okay, Jess.
Use your words.

46:21.318 --> 46:23.285
H-How do I know that this isn't

46:23.287 --> 46:26.254
some fucked-up game
that you guys play?

46:26.256 --> 46:28.491
You know, h-how do I know
that James is not in on this?

46:44.042 --> 46:45.540
<i>Fucking...
just fucking say something.</i>

46:45.542 --> 46:47.743
<i>Can you just say something?</i>

46:47.745 --> 46:50.482
<i>I-I need you to talk to me.</i>

46:52.082 --> 46:55.319
You've got to tell me
w-what happened in there.

46:58.156 --> 47:00.122
Wow, am I the only one
who feels like things

47:00.124 --> 47:03.758
just got
a little awkward in here?

47:03.760 --> 47:07.164
I think a drink
would break the ice.

47:15.606 --> 47:17.506
James, would you
do the honors?

47:26.249 --> 47:29.618
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Ladies first.

47:29.620 --> 47:31.252
I'm good.

47:31.254 --> 47:35.790
Jess, James went
to extraordinary lengths

47:35.792 --> 47:38.430
to procure this bottle for you.

47:42.499 --> 47:43.531
Ugh. Come on.

47:43.533 --> 47:44.866
Mm! Mm! Mm!

47:44.868 --> 47:48.205
- All right, enough, enough.
- Mm! Mm.

47:49.240 --> 47:50.575
Oh, fuck.

48:01.452 --> 48:05.187
There is nothing like
a drink and a smoke.

48:05.189 --> 48:07.156
I remember the first time
I had them both together.

48:07.158 --> 48:08.656
I was 14.

48:08.658 --> 48:11.392
It was an act of defiance
and self-gratification

48:11.394 --> 48:14.263
that just perfectly hit
the person I was

48:14.265 --> 48:16.765
and my place in the world.

48:16.767 --> 48:19.801
And it's never been
the fucking same since.

48:19.803 --> 48:21.736
What do you mean?

48:21.738 --> 48:25.409
That nothing's ever as fucking
good as the first time.

48:28.178 --> 48:31.346
James, have you tried this?

48:31.348 --> 48:33.582
Never.

48:33.584 --> 48:34.850
Enjoy it.

48:34.852 --> 48:37.153
You never will
quite the sa...

48:37.155 --> 48:40.321
again.

48:40.323 --> 48:41.823
Damn.

48:41.825 --> 48:45.493
Not even your shitty
philosophizing can ruin that.

48:47.397 --> 48:48.796
There you go.

48:48.798 --> 48:51.267
One drink, and your
sense of humor is back.

48:51.269 --> 48:52.703
You can give up
the buddy shit, Bruno.

48:54.437 --> 48:56.404
I am your buddy, man.

48:56.406 --> 48:57.805
In fact, right now,

48:57.807 --> 49:00.709
I'm your best friend
in the whole world.

49:00.711 --> 49:02.544
James, I'm really cold.

49:02.546 --> 49:04.348
Do you mind
if I borrow your jacket?

49:06.283 --> 49:08.252
Ever the gentleman.

49:11.388 --> 49:12.888
I undid
the child locks.

49:12.890 --> 49:15.924
Oh, Jess, if you're cold,
we should get going.

49:15.926 --> 49:17.926
It's your turn to drive.

49:17.928 --> 49:19.962
I'm not driving.

49:19.964 --> 49:21.497
Why not?

49:21.499 --> 49:23.535
I thought everyone in L.A.
drives drunk.

49:26.870 --> 49:30.474
Good to know
James has a big mouth.

49:31.309 --> 49:33.845
Ugh. James.

49:40.685 --> 49:42.317
Come on, James.

49:42.319 --> 49:45.156
You don't want to miss
the end of your own date.

49:51.261 --> 49:52.361
Give me another swig.

49:52.363 --> 49:54.363
- Whoa.
- Are you insane?

49:54.365 --> 49:57.269
And I thought <i>I</i> had
low regard for human life.

50:06.443 --> 50:08.879
Mm!

50:11.314 --> 50:12.814
You got dumped tonight, right?

50:12.816 --> 50:15.783
James, you do have
a big fucking mouth.

50:15.785 --> 50:18.821
Is that why you're doing this?
Because she hurt you?

50:18.823 --> 50:20.355
She hurt your feelings,

50:20.357 --> 50:22.323
and... and now you think
you're gonna relive

50:22.325 --> 50:24.892
your... your old relationship
with James and me

50:24.894 --> 50:26.294
is... is really gonna...

50:26.296 --> 50:28.497
Darling,
your pop-psychology bullshit

50:28.499 --> 50:30.633
is not gonna get you
out of this one.

50:30.635 --> 50:32.537
<i>Please enter a destination.</i>

50:37.642 --> 50:41.776
Look, you've been afforded
an opportunity tonight.

50:41.778 --> 50:45.281
We're conditioned
to do what's expected,

50:45.283 --> 50:48.417
down to following
the GPS instructions

50:48.419 --> 50:50.685
that come out of
our fucking phones.

50:50.687 --> 50:54.923
But tonight,
you get to do otherwise.

50:54.925 --> 50:56.792
I'm sorry.

50:56.794 --> 50:59.861
For what?

50:59.863 --> 51:01.398
For undoing the child locks.

51:03.901 --> 51:06.468
Aah! Fuck!

51:06.470 --> 51:08.002
James, come on!

51:08.004 --> 51:09.904
Run! Run, Jess!

51:09.906 --> 51:11.674
James!

51:11.676 --> 51:13.841
James!

51:13.843 --> 51:16.044
Hold on. Hold on.
I-I... I need you to hold the...

51:26.557 --> 51:28.957
You came back for her.

51:28.959 --> 51:31.696
Let's see if she shows you
the same courtesy.

51:48.111 --> 51:49.977
I missed you, Jess.

51:49.979 --> 51:52.480
You shouldn't have come back.

51:52.482 --> 51:54.383
We better get Captain America
here to a drugstore

51:54.385 --> 51:58.890
before he vomits all over
his pleather interior and me.

52:00.790 --> 52:02.057
I'm so sorry, James.

52:02.059 --> 52:04.392
I dislocated
your shoulder back there,

52:04.394 --> 52:07.662
so it's gonna hurt like shit
until I pop it back in.

52:07.664 --> 52:10.031
At which point
it's gonna hurt even worse.

52:10.033 --> 52:11.533
Is that okay, buddy?

52:11.535 --> 52:12.667
Leave him alone.

52:12.669 --> 52:15.837
Fine, <i>you</i> pop it back in.

52:15.839 --> 52:17.740
Jess.

52:17.742 --> 52:19.741
W-Wh...

52:19.743 --> 52:21.877
It's okay, James.
Use your words.

52:21.879 --> 52:23.779
Why would you come back?

52:23.781 --> 52:25.848
Isn't it obvious?

52:25.850 --> 52:27.716
'Cause she's a good person,
dawg.

52:27.718 --> 52:29.817
What's she gonna do,
leave you here with me?

52:29.819 --> 52:31.655
That's cold.

52:34.624 --> 52:36.892
All right, we're gonna need
a few things...

52:36.894 --> 52:38.894
painkillers, a sling,

52:38.896 --> 52:41.796
and something wooden
for James to bite down onto.

52:41.798 --> 52:43.634
Here's how we're gonna do this.

52:50.673 --> 52:53.441
Hi, Bruno.
Hey, it's me... Bruno.

52:53.443 --> 52:56.113
Bruno, may I speak to Jess,
please?

52:59.550 --> 53:01.816
It's for you.

53:01.818 --> 53:03.919
Jess,
would you do me a favor?

53:03.921 --> 53:05.787
Would you keep this on speaker?

53:05.789 --> 53:08.459
And hum something for me
so I know you're there.

53:12.763 --> 53:14.062
Can you hand me my purse?

53:14.064 --> 53:16.064
I think it's wedged
between the seats.

53:16.066 --> 53:18.669
Looks like you've got
some shoplifting to do.

53:19.970 --> 53:21.569
Hop to.

53:21.571 --> 53:24.408
James back here
isn't getting any healthier.

53:30.513 --> 53:31.979
Oh, and Jess?

53:31.981 --> 53:35.419
If you bring back any help,
I'll kill him.

54:09.986 --> 54:12.254
Can I help you find
anything tonight, ma'am?

54:12.256 --> 54:14.591
I...

54:18.828 --> 54:20.865
Sorry, what are you saying?

54:21.865 --> 54:23.198
I'm okay, thank you.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.535
Okay.

54:30.874 --> 54:34.611
Someone is taking
her sweet time.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.779
At least she could've done us
the courtesy

54:37.781 --> 54:39.948
of closing the door.

54:39.950 --> 54:41.953
It's chilly.

54:51.729 --> 54:53.160
<i>The body of a man</i>

54:53.162 --> 54:54.997
<i>found in Hollywood
earlier this evening</i>

54:54.999 --> 54:58.600
<i>has been identified
as 31-year-old Bruno Anthony.</i>

54:58.602 --> 55:01.035
<i>Anthony was
a respected club promoter</i>

55:01.037 --> 55:03.538
<i>in the Los Angeles
nightlife community.</i>

55:03.540 --> 55:06.040
<i>Friends are still in shock
at the vicious murder,</i>

55:06.042 --> 55:08.009
<i>which the LAPD have determined</i>

55:08.011 --> 55:10.578
<i>was the result
of blunt force trauma.</i>

55:10.580 --> 55:13.115
<i>Anthony's body was found
inside the Hollywood apartment</i>

55:13.117 --> 55:16.051
<i>that he shared with
his fiancée, Gwyneth Cassidy.</i>

55:16.053 --> 55:19.187
<i>Before his death, Anthony
announced his recent engagement</i>

55:19.189 --> 55:22.024
<i>to the woman he called
"the love of his life."</i>

55:22.026 --> 55:24.959
<i>The couple posted
this picture to social media,</i>

55:24.961 --> 55:27.129
<i>a snapshot of how
he lived his life,</i>

55:27.131 --> 55:29.600
<i>friends said, always smiling.</i>

55:37.106 --> 55:41.843
Hey, it was brave,
what you did back there.

55:41.845 --> 55:45.046
Misguided, but brave.

55:45.048 --> 55:47.281
Why, man?

55:47.283 --> 55:48.783
Tell me
that's not your question.

55:48.785 --> 55:51.153
Why are you
really doing this?

55:51.155 --> 55:56.725
"Some men just want
to watch the world burn."

55:56.727 --> 55:57.926
That's from "The Dark Knight."

55:57.928 --> 55:59.660
Yeah, I got
the fucking referencing.

55:59.662 --> 56:01.696
I want to help you, man.

56:01.698 --> 56:03.765
I don't know.
Why does anybody do anything?

56:03.767 --> 56:05.834
What the fuck
is taking her so long?

56:05.836 --> 56:07.301
Do you really know
what to do about this?

56:07.303 --> 56:10.638
You'll drink something,
I'll pop it back in.

56:10.640 --> 56:12.607
It'll be chill.

56:12.609 --> 56:13.908
Ish.

56:13.910 --> 56:15.843
Just don't pick a fight
with me again.

56:15.845 --> 56:18.080
That's a losing proposition.

56:18.082 --> 56:19.348
Hey, don't touch him.

56:19.350 --> 56:23.785
Give me the phone.
Get in the front.

56:23.787 --> 56:24.986
Scooch.

56:29.325 --> 56:31.628
Wash those down with that.

56:32.629 --> 56:35.232
Tastes even better
when it's free, right?

56:37.267 --> 56:41.069
I think we all earned
a nice milkshake for ourselves.

56:41.071 --> 56:42.703
But nothing's gonna be...

56:42.705 --> 56:46.040
There's a Jack in the Box
at the end of Sunset.

56:46.042 --> 56:48.211
You ready, brother?

56:49.213 --> 56:50.645
I want to kill you.

56:50.647 --> 56:52.948
Who are you kidding?

56:52.950 --> 56:55.218
You're a good person, dog.

56:56.687 --> 56:58.690
I shot the clerk
in the liquor store.

56:59.789 --> 57:01.256
What?

57:01.258 --> 57:04.660
You shouldn't have
come back for me.

57:04.662 --> 57:06.227
James, that's very gallant,

57:06.229 --> 57:09.930
but for the time being,
open your mouth.

57:09.932 --> 57:12.734
Open.
You'll thank me later.

57:12.736 --> 57:14.403
Fuck! Oh!

57:14.405 --> 57:17.839
Three, two, one.

57:24.948 --> 57:28.082
Jess, remember when you
told us you could sing?

57:28.084 --> 57:30.017
Give us a song.

57:30.019 --> 57:33.055
James back here
is looking pretty grim.

57:33.057 --> 57:35.256
- He could use some cheering up.
- No.

James,
aren't you gonna applaud?

59:02.111 --> 59:03.912
Bruno, will you please
just stop?

59:03.914 --> 59:06.314
James, you of all people know
how important applause is.

59:06.316 --> 59:09.183
Come on, man.
Go on.

59:09.185 --> 59:11.289
Ovate.

59:15.459 --> 59:18.062
Yes! Yes.

59:24.468 --> 59:26.334
<i>Welcome to Jack in the Box.
My name is Shawn.</i>

59:26.336 --> 59:28.370
<i>Can I interest you
in our late-night</i>

59:28.372 --> 59:30.272
<i>stacked grilled cheeseburger
munchie meal tonight?</i>

59:30.274 --> 59:31.973
Well, I don't know, Shawn.

59:31.975 --> 59:33.341
Why don't you walk me through
the late-night

59:33.343 --> 59:34.875
grilled stacked cheeseburger
munchie meal.

59:34.877 --> 59:36.544
<i>It's our signature
sourdough Jack</i>

59:36.546 --> 59:38.345
<i>with a grilled cheese on top,
served with two tacos,</i>

59:38.347 --> 59:40.048
<i>halfsies curly
and regular fries,</i>

59:40.050 --> 59:41.582
<i>and a 20-ounce drink
for $6.10 before tax.</i>

59:41.584 --> 59:44.151
$6.10 before tax?
Sign me up, Shawn.

59:44.153 --> 59:45.319
<i>What kind of drink
would you like with that?</i>

59:45.321 --> 59:46.354
Let's do a Dr Pepper.

59:46.356 --> 59:47.923
<i>Will that be all tonight?</i>

59:47.925 --> 59:50.024
Fuck no! Sorry, Shawn.
Pardon my language.

59:50.026 --> 59:51.526
You're not religious
or anything, are you?

59:51.528 --> 59:53.861
Anyway, I'm gonna get
some chicken nuggets

59:53.863 --> 59:55.330
for my friend Jess in here.

59:55.332 --> 59:57.098
<i>Would you like the meal
or just the nuggets?</i>

59:57.100 --> 59:59.433
You know, fuck it, let's get her
some jalapeño poppers too.

59:59.435 --> 01:00:00.868
<i>Will that be all tonight?</i>

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:02.870
You just asked that, and no.

01:00:02.872 --> 01:00:05.040
I'd like to get my friend James
something as well.

01:00:05.042 --> 01:00:06.941
James, what would you like?

01:00:06.943 --> 01:00:09.276
He is gonna have
a vanilla milkshake,

01:00:09.278 --> 01:00:11.214
please and thank you, Shawn.

01:00:25.562 --> 01:00:28.029
How are those nuggets, Jess?

01:00:28.031 --> 01:00:29.865
It was always my favorite
in high school...

01:00:29.867 --> 01:00:32.566
get high, come up here.

01:00:32.568 --> 01:00:35.303
Chicken nuggets.

01:00:35.305 --> 01:00:39.908
And a Dr Pepper and curly fries.

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:41.609
That was the order.

01:00:41.611 --> 01:00:44.347
That was perfection.

01:00:47.383 --> 01:00:49.252
Still mad at your friend James?

01:00:50.921 --> 01:00:52.953
He's no killer.

01:00:52.955 --> 01:00:55.490
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

01:00:55.492 --> 01:00:59.461
We watched. That shot came
from behind the counter, man.

01:00:59.463 --> 01:01:03.098
Probably some paranoid,
trigger-happy NRA dickface

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.899
with lousy aim.

01:01:04.901 --> 01:01:06.901
Lucky James.

01:01:06.903 --> 01:01:09.437
Why would you lie about that?

01:01:09.439 --> 01:01:13.975
Probably to make me think
he's capable of killing me.

01:01:13.977 --> 01:01:16.511
I don't know.

01:01:16.513 --> 01:01:18.479
Can't shit a shitter, James.

01:01:18.481 --> 01:01:23.588
These fucking fries
are amazing.

01:01:26.256 --> 01:01:28.526
James, how's that shake, dude?

01:01:29.593 --> 01:01:31.959
I'm just kidding.
I don't care.

01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:34.194
Let's roll, shall we?

01:01:34.196 --> 01:01:38.366
<i>James,
please enter a destination.</i>

01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:40.100
Where to, Bruno?

01:01:40.102 --> 01:01:42.937
Top of Monument,
right off Sunset.

01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:44.941
All the way to the dead end.

01:01:46.542 --> 01:01:49.009
What's there?

01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:51.680
A hot tub, obviously.

01:01:51.682 --> 01:01:53.714
<i>Please follow
the highlighted route.</i>

01:01:53.716 --> 01:01:56.216
Honestly, you guys,
I'm feeling a little guilty

01:01:56.218 --> 01:01:57.451
because you both shared

01:01:57.453 --> 01:01:59.486
some really profound shit
with me earlier.

01:01:59.488 --> 01:02:01.522
So I want to share something
with the both of you,

01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:04.725
something that's always
meant a lot to me.

01:02:04.727 --> 01:02:06.962
But I can't do it alone.

01:02:06.964 --> 01:02:08.629
There's gonna be some
chorus shit that you have to do.

01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:10.198
You'll figure it out.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.600
<i>Now, usually I don't do this,
but, uh,</i>

01:02:13.602 --> 01:02:15.203

<i>You have reached

01:04:13.189 --> 01:04:15.756
<i>We hope you had
a safe and pleasant ride.</i>

01:04:18.127 --> 01:04:19.493
You okay?

01:04:19.495 --> 01:04:20.798
Yeah.

01:04:22.332 --> 01:04:24.131
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

01:04:24.133 --> 01:04:25.834
Go, go.

01:04:25.836 --> 01:04:29.040
The house.
We got to go for the house.

01:04:35.511 --> 01:04:37.745
- James, hurry.
- Hold on. Hey.

01:04:37.747 --> 01:04:40.651
- Hold on.
- Fuck, he's getting out.

01:04:43.519 --> 01:04:45.687
Hey.

01:04:45.689 --> 01:04:48.388
Open the damn door!

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:49.756
Hey, come on,
open the fucking door.

01:04:49.758 --> 01:04:51.792
- Come on. James. James.
- Somebody help us.

01:04:51.794 --> 01:04:53.630
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:04:58.734 --> 01:04:59.803
James.

01:05:03.339 --> 01:05:05.075
Oh, fuck.

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:07.609
James!

01:05:07.611 --> 01:05:10.114
The pool.
We need to get in the pool.

01:05:14.584 --> 01:05:15.883
Oh, it's a bad idea.

01:05:15.885 --> 01:05:18.520
- We don't have time.
- Fuck this thing.

01:05:37.473 --> 01:05:38.805
I'm really sorry.

01:05:38.807 --> 01:05:40.610
It's okay.

01:06:20.716 --> 01:06:22.552
Let there be...

01:06:32.328 --> 01:06:34.662
I told you
we were going to a hot tub.

01:06:34.664 --> 01:06:36.200
Get out.

01:06:42.305 --> 01:06:43.507
James...

01:06:44.908 --> 01:06:46.743
You can end the ride now.

01:06:47.943 --> 01:06:49.646
This is our destination.

01:06:55.651 --> 01:06:58.419
I'll be sure to give you
five stars in my review.

01:06:58.421 --> 01:07:00.654
What do you want from us?

01:07:05.562 --> 01:07:08.529
To do just what you said,

01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:10.698
for God's sake.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.834
Let us sit upon the ground

01:07:13.836 --> 01:07:19.006
and tell sad stories
of the death of kings.

01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:20.975
Strip.

01:07:20.977 --> 01:07:23.678
Bruno, come on, man.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.946
You wanted to get
in the hot tub, right?

01:07:25.948 --> 01:07:29.316
I mean, that's why we're here,
isn't it?

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:30.350
I want to go home.

01:07:30.352 --> 01:07:32.620
Don't tell me to let you go

01:07:32.622 --> 01:07:34.656
or that
I'm making you stay here

01:07:34.658 --> 01:07:37.825
or whatever other fake-ass
bullshit you tell yourself

01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:41.895
to justify your fundamentally
unsatisfying existence.

01:07:41.897 --> 01:07:43.566
Because frankly...

01:07:45.035 --> 01:07:46.437
...I won't buy it.

01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:54.441
Now, take off your clothes
and get in the fucking hot tub.

01:07:54.443 --> 01:07:56.446
Off.

01:08:14.363 --> 01:08:16.499
We have to
get the gun.

01:08:26.408 --> 01:08:29.443
Damn, bro.
You work out?

01:08:29.444 --> 01:08:32.015
You too, Jess.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.399
<i>Bellissima.</i>

01:08:52.401 --> 01:08:54.602
James, you ever kind of wish
you were Italian?

01:08:54.604 --> 01:08:58.037
Those guys get to say whatever
they want about a woman's body,

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.840
and nobody bats an eye.

01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:03.880
Now, get in
the fucking hot tub.

01:09:31.607 --> 01:09:35.678
- I'm gonna take a swig of this.
- You're gonna need it.

01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:42.118
What are you doing?

01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:48.456
Oh, "something, something"
desperate times.

01:09:48.457 --> 01:09:51.158
"Something, something"
desperate measures.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.760
- I'm not desperate.
- Jessica.

01:09:53.761 --> 01:09:56.798
Tonight you asked
your cab driver on a date.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.666
Belittle me all you want, Bruno.

01:09:59.668 --> 01:10:01.001
I'm not belittling you.

01:10:01.003 --> 01:10:02.836
That's what you are.
You drive people around.

01:10:02.838 --> 01:10:04.839
You offer them adorable
little bottles of water.

01:10:04.841 --> 01:10:06.541
You do everything
in your power

01:10:06.543 --> 01:10:09.042
to block the nagging voice
in your head that says,

01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:11.778
"I will never be
anything other than this."

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:15.849
And until you acknowledge that,
you never will.

01:10:15.851 --> 01:10:18.219
So is that what this is about?

01:10:18.221 --> 01:10:20.720
You think you're
somehow helping us?

01:10:20.722 --> 01:10:22.857
You're an amazing actor, James,

01:10:22.859 --> 01:10:24.992
but no one's ever
gonna know that.

01:10:24.994 --> 01:10:29.162
Because when the time
comes to act, you hesitate.

01:10:29.164 --> 01:10:34.768
You told me you just wanted to
play Richard II before you die.

01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:36.237
And now you're gonna kill me?

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:38.572
Don't be so banal.

01:10:38.574 --> 01:10:41.675
Tonight isn't about dying.
It's about living.

01:10:42.712 --> 01:10:44.612
If we make it to sunrise,

01:10:44.614 --> 01:10:47.247
you will forever
look back on this night

01:10:47.249 --> 01:10:51.051
and remember what it felt like
to be alive.

01:10:51.053 --> 01:10:53.487
Now, you get to choose.

01:10:53.489 --> 01:10:55.425
Who goes first?

01:10:56.559 --> 01:10:58.559
You or her?

01:10:58.561 --> 01:11:00.161
Me, Bruno.

01:11:00.163 --> 01:11:02.332
- Fucking point your gun at me.
- Great.

01:11:06.202 --> 01:11:07.934
Is this Gwyn's house?

01:11:07.936 --> 01:11:10.270
What the fuck did you just say?

01:11:10.272 --> 01:11:14.041
Bruno A.
stands for Bruno Anthony,

01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:17.210
a dead club promoter
they found in Hollywood.

01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:18.946
This guy
doesn't look dead to me.

01:11:18.948 --> 01:11:21.682
I hope I don't look like
a fucking club promoter either.

01:11:21.684 --> 01:11:25.018
They said he's survived
by his fiancée, Gwyneth.

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.589
You told us that you suffered
from a recent breakup.

01:11:28.591 --> 01:11:30.791
I believe that.
That's not a lie.

01:11:30.793 --> 01:11:32.693
No, the only thing
you lied about

01:11:32.695 --> 01:11:34.731
is how long ago
it actually happened.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.936
Go on, Bruno, use your words.

01:11:45.574 --> 01:11:46.909
Get out of the tub!

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:54.782
I knew it.

01:11:54.784 --> 01:11:56.550
Hey, hey,
don't you fucking move, man!

01:11:56.552 --> 01:11:59.085
- I knew I could get you to do...
- Don't listen to him.

01:11:59.087 --> 01:12:00.621
...anything.

01:12:00.623 --> 01:12:03.724
I knew I could get you
to pick up a girl,

01:12:03.726 --> 01:12:07.929
to commit armed robbery,
to kill somebody.

01:12:07.931 --> 01:12:09.897
Let's just get out of here!

01:12:09.899 --> 01:12:11.866
I guess that somebody's me.

01:12:11.868 --> 01:12:13.033
Fuck you!

01:12:13.035 --> 01:12:15.635
You said
you were just a henchman.

01:12:15.637 --> 01:12:17.837
Now you get to be
a full-on villain.

01:12:17.839 --> 01:12:19.273
Fuck this guy, James.
Let's just go.

01:12:19.275 --> 01:12:20.544
Do it.

01:12:21.945 --> 01:12:23.944
Do it!

01:12:23.946 --> 01:12:25.248
Goodbye, Bruno.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.252
James.

01:12:34.923 --> 01:12:36.059
Come on!

01:12:38.226 --> 01:12:40.961
I thought you were my buddy.

01:12:40.963 --> 01:12:44.200
Stay with me, brother.

01:12:47.704 --> 01:12:49.540
James!

01:12:57.913 --> 01:13:02.251
<i>Hello, James.
You have one new ride request.</i>

01:13:17.165 --> 01:13:20.671
<i>Ride accepted.
Let's ride.</i>

01:13:29.712 --> 01:13:31.845
Hello, is this Maria?

01:13:31.847 --> 01:13:35.084
This is James.
I'm your ride.
