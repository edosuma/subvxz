00:07.336 --> 00:08.760
Please help me.

00:08.860 --> 00:12.449
My name is James Holden, speaking for
the five survivors of the Canterbury.

00:13.028 --> 00:16.966
Our ship was destroyed answering a
bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli.

00:17.185 --> 00:21.353
We recovered a false beacon and
identified it as Martian Naval technology.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.388
It was a trap.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.724
Torpedo launch!

00:25.726 --> 00:27.309
Those weren't meant for us.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.894
Canterbury, burn like
hell. You got incoming.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.869
Juliette Andromeda Mao.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.905
You crewed her up on a
ship called the Scopuli.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.241
That would explain your
interest in her, huh?

00:44.378 --> 00:45.628
Sayonara, Ceres.

00:45.663 --> 00:47.746
That's my going-away present to you.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.915
Onto bigger and better things.

00:50.251 --> 00:54.253
We're gonna retire to Mars and
the Mariner Valley Circle of Life.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.639
My diplomatic credentials
have been revoked.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.308
I've been banned from Mars for life.

01:00.478 --> 01:02.895
Frank Degraaf was found dead
in his home this morning.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.981
Suicide. I'm so sorry.

01:06.017 --> 01:09.602
This is the ship. The one that
killed the Cant. It has to be.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.522
Someone forced their way out of this.

01:17.612 --> 01:18.827
Holden, behind you!

01:19.280 --> 01:21.447
I think it's absorbing
energy from the reactor.

01:21.699 --> 01:24.500
Anyway, what do you know about
this kid? Why she's on Eros.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.952
I believe in her.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.623
You're going to Eros, aren't
you? Let me help you find him.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.541
I'm looking for a friend
who checked into a room here.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.792
Lionel Polanski.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.095
Hey!

01:42.553 --> 01:44.553
Shit just follow you around, don't it, kid?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.971
Who the hell are you? And
what are you doing here?

01:47.358 --> 01:48.390
Julie?

01:52.113 --> 01:55.981
Everything going on out there,
all this shit storm that we're in,

01:56.033 --> 01:59.318
it's all got to do with her, Julie Mao.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.289
You know that memory crypt
that we took out of that stiff?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.074
Yeah? All right. Go 3-D.

02:05.409 --> 02:09.328
It had an unregistered flight
path for a ship called the Anubis.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.498
The Anubis left Phoebe Research Station,

02:12.500 --> 02:15.834
and it was headed for Eros, okay?

02:16.053 --> 02:22.341
Now, I'm thinking, hmm, maybe something's
being transported on this ship.

02:22.977 --> 02:27.730
I'm thinking Julie's ship
was sent out to intercept it.

02:28.149 --> 02:31.567
And then, suddenly
ships start blowing up...

02:31.602 --> 02:34.687
The Canterbury, the Donnager... 
It's got to be connected.

02:34.739 --> 02:37.690
What do you think is on this Anubis?

02:39.193 --> 02:43.362
Something. Something worth
spilling a lot of blood over.

02:47.464 --> 02:51.229
_

02:59.580 --> 03:01.580
_

03:03.134 --> 03:05.134
_

03:05.936 --> 03:07.219
Ladar's really flaky.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.221
Ah, scopes on this bucket suck.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.774
It's nothing bigger than a light transport,

03:11.809 --> 03:13.976
nothing we can't handle, gova gut.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.027
I'm not worried.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.862
You gonna lock up from the adrenaline.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.197
I know how to fly.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.366
Easy. I'm not trying to
pet you the wrong way.

03:21.152 --> 03:22.317
I'm trying to help.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.872
I'm sorry. It's just been a long
time coming. A long fight to get here.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.907
If I had your kind of money, I'd be sitting

03:28.909 --> 03:31.043
- in a penthouse at the Shangri-La... 
- It's my father's money.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.579
I see. And that's his weapon on that ship.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.082
Belters need to know what it is,
so it can't be used against us.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.250
Us?

03:38.252 --> 03:39.835
You are a true believer.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.887
That she is.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.722
You may not share our brittle bones,

03:43.758 --> 03:46.008
but you're definitely
one of us, Beltalowda.

03:47.178 --> 03:48.727
I saw you race once.

03:48.763 --> 03:51.897
- Beautiful ship. The, uh... 
- Razorback.

03:52.183 --> 03:54.600
Hot ship. Hotter pilot.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.021
Prepare to intercept.

03:59.774 --> 04:01.356
Matching course and speed.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.074

04:16.540 --> 04:18.791
Boarding team check, Komang Gutegow?

04:18.793 --> 04:21.260
Ya, Bosmang, grappling team, standing by.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.679
Soon as hooks are in,
we drop charges, breach,

04:23.714 --> 04:25.547
subdue crew, grab the cargo then.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.634
Mowsh Ando Natet, Beratnas,
they're scientists, not soldiers.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.636
They work for my father. They'll fight.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.951
Where did that come from?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.736
That's the Anubis.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.987
That's a gunship.

05:00.835 --> 05:02.918
Breaching pod, amidships!

05:02.970 --> 05:05.003
Seal all compartments! All
hands! We're being boarded!

05:47.548 --> 05:50.465
Stinking Belters. Always
trying to take what isn't yours.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.303
How'd you know we'd be here? How?

05:58.192 --> 06:00.559
Hands off that one. She's a complication.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.228
Put her in here until I
figure out what to do with her.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.238
Ma'am, the distress beacon

06:13.240 --> 06:14.740
has been planted on the Scopuli.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.625
Canterbury should be picking it up soon.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.293
Let's hope they take the bait.

06:18.329 --> 06:20.579
The sooner we get Earth and
Mars at each other's throats,

06:20.581 --> 06:22.247
the sooner we get their eyes off Eros.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.753
Does it feel hot in here to you?

06:28.255 --> 06:29.588
No.

06:29.807 --> 06:32.474
Well, I'm hot. Check climate
control and make it cooler.

06:32.509 --> 06:34.142
Yes, Ma'am.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.860
This is Lionel Polanski.
I repeat, Lionel Polanski.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.113
The crew is dead.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.983
I'm being held captive, I'm alone.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.486
Please help me. Somebody come and get me.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.708
Please! Somebody help!

07:40.661 --> 07:42.327
Somebody help, please!

07:49.553 --> 07:52.254
All hands to action Stations!

08:06.236 --> 08:07.936
Prepare to fire.

08:58.706 --> 09:02.574
Please! Get me out of here.

10:12.196 --> 10:15.480
This is Lionel Polanski.
Mission has failed.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.699
Scopuli has been lost.

10:18.569 --> 10:20.902
I'm aboard the Anubis, alone.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.573
There's something in the reactor.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.958
It looks like it consumed everyone else.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.796
If it's a bio-weapon...

10:30.820 --> 10:32.820
I've never seen anything like it.

10:35.144 --> 10:37.144
I have to get off this ship.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.140
I'll set up an O.P.A.locator beacon,

10:42.176 --> 10:43.842
and park it where no one else can find it.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.762
But I just have to leave.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.581
Eros Station is within
range of the Anubis shuttle.

11:11.787 --> 11:14.339
I'll be there, waiting for you.

13:06.805 --> 13:09.339
Miller, you asshole. Long time.

13:09.591 --> 13:10.807
How they swinging?

13:10.843 --> 13:12.142
So, listen, that ship
you were looking for...

13:12.177 --> 13:13.927
Anubis, whatever, it never showed up here.

13:13.979 --> 13:17.230
But the funny thing is, a short-range
shuttle from that ship did.

13:17.683 --> 13:21.151
Anubis 1-A is still here on
Eros, racking up dock fees.

13:21.687 --> 13:24.438
Kinda interested to know
what's in this for you, amigo.

13:37.536 --> 13:38.919
I tried...

13:48.764 --> 13:50.931
I tried to keep a low profile,

13:55.053 --> 13:57.020
but it wasn't as easy as I hoped.

14:02.561 --> 14:04.060
I had to get off the streets.

14:19.661 --> 14:21.578
I left a trail of bread crumbs.

14:23.248 --> 14:24.748
A way for you to find me.

14:28.637 --> 14:29.886
And I waited...

14:35.761 --> 14:37.561
And I waited...

14:43.569 --> 14:45.519
Dawes...

14:46.572 --> 14:48.071
You didn't even answer.

14:52.361 --> 14:54.611
Give the Martians their water.

15:00.035 --> 15:01.451
Why didn't you come?

15:06.091 --> 15:08.208
You have every right to be angry.

15:10.262 --> 15:11.795
You should be angry.

16:44.389 --> 16:49.559
Please, Mummy, don't let
him sell the Razorback.

16:50.812 --> 16:52.479
I want to see it again.

16:55.117 --> 16:56.783
See you...

17:00.289 --> 17:01.655
Proud of me...

17:06.411 --> 17:08.243
When I come home...

17:44.549 --> 17:45.982
Julie?

17:46.818 --> 17:49.119
Ugh! God, what's that smell?

17:50.355 --> 17:52.989
Sweat, sick.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.726
Nobody touch anything.

17:58.663 --> 17:59.996
Wait. Wait!

18:07.856 --> 18:09.189
Oh.

18:11.977 --> 18:13.143
Oh, my god.

18:25.657 --> 18:27.207
Don't touch her.

18:28.293 --> 18:29.793
She could be contagious.

18:32.164 --> 18:34.748
Come on, boys, we gotta go.

18:36.001 --> 18:37.333
Cavalry's on its way.

18:37.969 --> 18:39.969
If he wants to stay, let him.

18:41.673 --> 18:43.723
There's nothing you can do for her.

18:44.893 --> 18:48.011
And if you stay here, you'll
never find out who did this to her.

19:19.928 --> 19:21.127
Drop 'em!

19:21.379 --> 19:22.378
Not happening.

19:22.431 --> 19:23.430
Easy.

19:29.771 --> 19:31.020
Jesus, Miller.

19:31.723 --> 19:33.640
What the hell you got yourself into?

19:34.526 --> 19:35.942
Ain't no way I can clean all this up.

19:35.977 --> 19:38.144
- You got that right.
- We're not asking you to do anything.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.064
We're just gonna walk out of here
real easy. We didn't see each other.

19:41.116 --> 19:42.899
Look, you stay right where you are!

19:43.401 --> 19:45.285
Miller, you tell me what
the hell is going on here.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.319
She's gone.

19:47.456 --> 19:48.571
What, the girl?

19:59.384 --> 20:01.918
Room 22, don't touch anything in there.

20:10.762 --> 20:11.895
Miller.

20:15.433 --> 20:16.516
Just lay low.

20:18.068 --> 20:19.519
Don't leave this Station till we talk.

20:32.327 --> 20:33.793
Let's keep moving.

20:34.629 --> 20:36.496
We need to find out what he knows.

20:36.548 --> 20:38.775
Don't push him too hard right now.

20:38.939 --> 20:41.022
He's having a tough time
dealing with what we saw.

20:41.525 --> 20:43.492
The girl meant something to him.

20:43.527 --> 20:45.610
It was a shock finding her like that.

20:57.124 --> 20:59.791
Miller, in here.

21:03.514 --> 21:06.097
Seal off this tenement. No one
in or out without my say-so.

21:06.467 --> 21:09.518
Inspector Sematimba, CPM, what
the hell are you doing here?

21:09.553 --> 21:10.969
This is my crime scene.

21:12.139 --> 21:13.722
CPM works for me.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.474
I'm looking for this girl.

21:18.812 --> 21:20.862
Doesn't look like we were followed.

21:20.898 --> 21:22.147
That's a relief.

21:22.399 --> 21:24.032
Okay, I'd say we're all
in a bit of trouble here,

21:24.067 --> 21:25.116
so why don't we just figure out...

21:25.152 --> 21:26.902
What were you doing following Julie?

21:27.654 --> 21:28.870
We didn't know who we were looking for...

21:28.906 --> 21:30.539
Who were those thugs back at the hotel?

21:30.574 --> 21:31.623
We don't know.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.375
Any goddamn thing you do know?

21:34.044 --> 21:37.429
All that stuff on her, we
saw it before on the Anubis.

21:38.999 --> 21:39.998
The Anubis.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.802
- What happened to her? What happened to her?
- Settle down!

21:43.837 --> 21:46.054
- Back off! Back off!
- Hey, easy there!

21:46.089 --> 21:47.639
Amos, for god's sake, do something!

21:47.674 --> 21:49.508
What we should be doing is leaving.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.892
The cops are gonna be all over us.

21:50.928 --> 21:53.678
We need to get back to the
Roci and off this rock now.

21:54.264 --> 21:55.263
He's right.

21:56.517 --> 21:57.682
We shouldn't separate.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.487
I'm going to prep the ship for
dust-off. You guys meet us there.

22:06.827 --> 22:10.695
We both followed Julie here.
We both have part of the story.

22:11.532 --> 22:13.448
I want the truth as bad as you do.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.556
Thank you for letting me come.

22:41.562 --> 22:43.895
Craig, I'm devastated.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.282
- I never would have thought he's... 
- You weren't here.

22:49.286 --> 22:52.621
I heard he was doing consulting
work for the shipyards,

22:53.040 --> 22:54.573
which I took as a good sign.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.958
That make you feel better
about betraying him?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.210
There was no consulting work.

22:59.830 --> 23:02.414
I found out he was paying
for those trips himself.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.216
He was ashamed of sitting around the house,

23:05.502 --> 23:06.835
so I played along.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.420
I let him keep his pride.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.255
It was the only thing he had left.

23:10.307 --> 23:11.423
He had you.

23:12.059 --> 23:13.925
He loved you more than anything.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.761
Frank always said,

23:17.314 --> 23:21.933
"it is damn near impossible to
stay properly mad at that brat."

23:24.521 --> 23:25.987
I'm not Frank.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.028
Would you mind if...

23:36.450 --> 23:38.166
I need to say goodbye.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.035
Should I be wearing a mask?

25:04.087 --> 25:05.370
It's not airborne.

25:07.791 --> 25:10.508
But if it's wet, don't touch it.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.217
Unless you want incredible
things to happen.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.728
She's got more than enough in her.

25:31.565 --> 25:33.815
Tell the crew to prepare the injections.

25:37.821 --> 25:39.070
Give us a moment.

25:47.214 --> 25:50.048
I'm truly sorry to be the
one to have to tell you this,

25:50.634 --> 25:52.167
but your daughter is dead.

25:54.971 --> 25:58.089
We still don't know what
exactly happened on the Anubis,

25:58.925 --> 26:01.760
but it looks as though
Julie was the lone survivor.

26:01.762 --> 26:05.346
Somehow, she managed to
pilot the shuttle to Eros.

26:09.436 --> 26:13.438
The only thing that I can say
to temper this terrible news

26:13.740 --> 26:17.942
is that I was able to obtain a
viable sample of the protomolecule.

26:18.612 --> 26:21.863
The injections have been
prepared. We're ready for lockdown.

26:22.282 --> 26:23.998
The irradiation units are in place.

26:24.034 --> 26:25.667
We can still do what needs to be done.

26:26.453 --> 26:28.253
We may not get another chance.

26:28.955 --> 26:33.174
We've come so far since that
incredible revelation on Phoebe.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.376
Now we stand on the precipice.

26:37.214 --> 26:40.298
We can only learn by letting it learn.

26:41.852 --> 26:44.052
All you need to do now is to give the word.

26:45.055 --> 26:46.271
I'll be waiting.

26:56.149 --> 26:57.647
We got lucky.

26:59.286 --> 27:00.785
Proceed as planned.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.990
We didn't hang around
on the Anubis long enough

27:06.042 --> 27:07.659
to figure out what that stuff was.

27:07.711 --> 27:09.911
We got off and nuked the ship behind us.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.329
What was Julie doing on the Anubis?

27:12.499 --> 27:15.166
She was O.P.A. She
found some new bio-weapon

27:15.168 --> 27:16.835
they were putting together on Phoebe.

27:17.671 --> 27:19.921
- So did we.
- She wanted to steal it.

27:21.591 --> 27:23.424
They couldn't use it on Belters.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.845
And they used it on her.

27:28.181 --> 27:29.347
She was an Earther.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.934
She died for the belt.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.690
What the hell was that?

27:44.364 --> 27:45.697
Attention.

27:45.699 --> 27:49.701
Eros Station has experienced
a radiation hazard breach.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.170
- For your own safety, please proceed... 
- You guys feel that?

27:52.205 --> 27:53.371
We sure did.

27:53.423 --> 27:55.173
Nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.674
Son of a bitch.

27:57.127 --> 27:58.543
A ship just blew up in the docks.

27:58.795 --> 28:00.962
- The Roci?
- No, it wasn't in that bay.

28:01.181 --> 28:03.882
That's the good news. The bad news is,

28:04.134 --> 28:06.217
the ships are all locked down tight.

28:09.556 --> 28:10.555
We're stuck here.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.023
Shit.

28:36.299 --> 28:37.632
Hmm.

29:04.194 --> 29:07.195
The drives that match these serial numbers,

29:08.031 --> 29:11.082
what ships were they installed in?

29:14.170 --> 29:16.087
Include black ops.

29:16.423 --> 29:17.956
Locate the drives.

29:18.291 --> 29:19.841
Where are they right now?

29:29.003 --> 29:30.836
For your own safety,
please proceed immediately

29:30.872 --> 29:32.955
to the nearest hard shelter
in an orderly fashion...

29:33.007 --> 29:34.206
What are you looking at?

29:34.496 --> 29:37.748
When I see them cops,
they're CPM Station security.

29:37.783 --> 29:39.282
They're gangsters with badges.

29:39.334 --> 29:41.868
One team rounds 'em up,
the other shakes 'em out.

29:42.671 --> 29:45.372
This was planned. They have assignments.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.678
They knew it was gonna happen.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.681
How could they know a ship was
going to blow up in the docks?

29:57.853 --> 29:59.853
They blew it up themselves.

30:07.112 --> 30:08.478
Hey! Where the hell are you going?

30:10.816 --> 30:12.482
- Let him go!
- Miller's onto something.

30:12.735 --> 30:14.785
It's all connected. The Cant, the girl...

30:14.820 --> 30:16.486
It's not your problem.

30:16.905 --> 30:18.288
And it's not your fault.

30:18.574 --> 30:19.990
None of it is.

30:20.375 --> 30:21.575
Okay.

30:22.661 --> 30:24.661
But now I'm making it my problem.

30:25.464 --> 30:27.748
Meet me back at the Roci,
I'll be a few hours, tops.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.499
We're better when we stick together.

30:30.753 --> 30:32.753
If I'm not back in three hours, leave.

30:33.138 --> 30:34.471
Attention.

30:34.506 --> 30:38.391
Eros Station has experienced
a radiation hazard breach.

30:39.060 --> 30:41.595
For your own safety, please
proceed immediately to the...

30:50.277 --> 30:53.653
Iodine supplement. Protects
from radiation. Mandatory.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.536
Pick it up!

31:03.540 --> 31:04.906
Move along.

31:27.097 --> 31:30.932
No. No. No. You do not want to
be around me right now, okay.

31:30.934 --> 31:33.434
This is gonna get ugly.
I'm getting used to ugly.

31:35.489 --> 31:36.938
Those two in the middle.

31:37.157 --> 31:39.574
The guys who took out the Donnager
had body armor just like that.

31:39.609 --> 31:40.942
Not who I'm aiming at.

31:44.781 --> 31:45.947
Who is he?

31:47.200 --> 31:48.750
One of the guys who do
what they did to Julie.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.536
You need to go back to your friends.

31:52.956 --> 31:54.122
Dammit!

31:54.174 --> 31:56.958
- If he killed Julie, he killed my ship too.
- I need you alive!

32:09.639 --> 32:12.106
- All right, Sabakawala.
- Hey! Break it on your feet!

32:12.809 --> 32:14.192
Towalda supposed to go to shelter.

32:14.394 --> 32:16.361
Hey! You go quiet and go now,

32:16.396 --> 32:17.812
else we throw you in there, ourselves.

32:18.064 --> 32:20.949
Help me up. My neck. Come on.

32:24.204 --> 32:26.237
Here's your problem, asshole.

32:26.790 --> 32:28.540
That just made me feel better.

32:29.793 --> 32:31.125
Turn around.

32:42.055 --> 32:44.172
My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson.

32:45.892 --> 32:49.010
Many of you know me, one way or another.

32:50.096 --> 32:52.263
My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson.

33:02.192 --> 33:04.609
My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson.

33:05.528 --> 33:08.863
Many of you know me, one way or another.

33:09.749 --> 33:11.616
I come before you today

33:11.668 --> 33:14.035
not as a member of the
Outer Planets Alliance,

33:14.504 --> 33:16.504
though I am proud to call myself one,

33:17.374 --> 33:19.958
but as citizen of the system.

33:21.761 --> 33:25.179
At this moment, the UNN Nathan Hale

33:25.599 --> 33:28.049
is headed for Tycho Station to arrest me

33:28.602 --> 33:32.553
because the UN believes I was involved
in the attacks on the Donnager.

33:33.273 --> 33:36.641
That is not true. And I can prove it.

33:38.111 --> 33:42.146
This datacube was recovered from
the wreckage of the Donnager,

33:42.198 --> 33:45.233
in the armor of a Martian marine.

33:46.236 --> 33:48.703
I'm broadcasting the raw
data with this message.

33:49.072 --> 33:51.572
Anyone can examine and authenticate it.

33:51.908 --> 33:56.210
It's a detailed analysis of the
ships that destroyed the Donnager.

33:56.746 --> 33:59.881
They were advanced stealth fighters.

34:00.884 --> 34:02.750
They didn't come from the Belt.

34:03.169 --> 34:04.802
I didn't build them.

34:05.088 --> 34:07.422
No Belter did, or could.

34:08.675 --> 34:12.092
Some people won't believe
that coming from me,

34:12.679 --> 34:14.429
because of who I am.

34:15.181 --> 34:16.597
I accept that.

34:17.567 --> 34:20.101
None of us can change
the things we've done.

34:20.737 --> 34:23.905
But we can all change what we do next.

34:25.442 --> 34:26.940
I've seen battle.

34:27.994 --> 34:29.777
I've taken many lives.

34:30.030 --> 34:33.748
I've been the oppressor,
and I know his mind.

34:34.951 --> 34:37.118
And now I hear the drumbeats of war.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.791
It's the sound of lies
and the love of power,

34:41.210 --> 34:43.427
and I cannot stand idly by.

34:44.179 --> 34:46.931
The belt has served the
inner planets for generations.

34:47.550 --> 34:50.634
Belters give, Earth and Mars take.

34:51.387 --> 34:53.219
Our language has changed,

34:53.889 --> 34:56.056
the things we care about have changed,

34:56.309 --> 34:58.726
even our bodies have changed.

34:59.562 --> 35:04.231
We look upon each other as different and
we've grown to hate each other for that.

35:04.901 --> 35:09.537
And now someone, somewhere,
for some ungodly reason

35:09.572 --> 35:12.907
wants the whole, sad lot
of us to fight and die.

35:13.543 --> 35:16.377
Well, this is not the Belt's fight.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.747
This evidence proves beyond a doubt

35:19.799 --> 35:24.919
that the ships that destroyed the Donnager
were built at the Bush Naval shipyards.

35:24.921 --> 35:26.587
They were built by Earth.

35:34.730 --> 35:38.015
All right, who is the guy you're guarding?

35:39.101 --> 35:40.351
The scientist?

35:42.188 --> 35:43.237
Yeah.

35:43.439 --> 35:44.605
He was a scientist.

35:47.777 --> 35:51.195
Dresden. I heard them call
him Dresden, that's all I know.

35:53.032 --> 35:55.032
What's this, huh?

35:55.334 --> 35:56.784
It's a Ceres Griega tatt.

35:57.036 --> 35:59.086
I used to run with them
back there, so what?

35:59.121 --> 36:00.838
So that makes you a gangster, you see.

36:01.123 --> 36:03.174
But you're wearing a
cop uniform. Why is that?

36:03.626 --> 36:04.625
I went straight.

36:07.263 --> 36:09.180
I'm gonna count to one. One.

36:10.132 --> 36:13.684
CPM offered a bunch of Griegas
jobs here, a few months back.

36:13.719 --> 36:17.304
Sweet salary, fat bonus,
no questions asked.

36:17.690 --> 36:20.608
And it wasn't just us. All the Ceres crews,

36:20.943 --> 36:25.529
Ggolden Bough, Dos Arriagas,
Sohiro's... They hired everybody.

36:25.565 --> 36:26.614
What for?

36:26.649 --> 36:28.532
Tech stuff, mostly, it turned out.

36:28.568 --> 36:32.453
They had us hooking up cameras and
science gear all over the Station.

36:34.156 --> 36:36.207
Why are you herding
everybody into those shelters?

36:36.409 --> 36:38.709
'Cause that's what they
asked me to do today!

36:38.961 --> 36:40.661
Their scrip spends.

36:41.881 --> 36:44.915
If these assholes want people in
those shelters, we should let them out.

36:44.967 --> 36:46.667
Hey, you're welcome to try.

36:46.719 --> 36:48.219
You said you were a cop.

36:48.838 --> 36:50.004
You a cop like him?

36:55.061 --> 36:57.011
You're going take me
to the nearest shelter,

36:57.013 --> 36:58.145
and you're gonna help me get in.

36:58.397 --> 37:01.515
CPM sees me with you, they shoot us both.

37:01.567 --> 37:02.983
Oh, he's got a point.

37:04.820 --> 37:05.853
Jesus, Miller!

37:07.990 --> 37:09.857
Let's get this poor officer some help.

37:16.532 --> 37:19.617
As far as I can tell, all the
transit pod lines are shut down.

37:20.536 --> 37:24.371
Why would they do that? All the ships
are locked down, nobody's going anywhere.

37:24.707 --> 37:26.590
First things first. The Roci.

37:26.876 --> 37:29.543
There's gotta be other ways to get
to the docks, so we need to find one.

37:30.763 --> 37:31.929
Wait...

37:32.965 --> 37:35.215
Holden, we're on the move...

37:38.721 --> 37:39.937
Comms just went dark.

37:42.058 --> 37:44.558
This ain't an accident. It's a plan.

37:50.066 --> 37:51.699
Please! I'm sorry I was late.

37:51.734 --> 37:54.201
The transit pods have been shut
down! The shelters are full.

37:54.236 --> 37:56.570
- Please! I just want to get to the shelters.
- Go home.

37:56.622 --> 37:57.738
Stay where you are!

37:57.740 --> 38:00.240
Move along now, or we will use force.

38:08.250 --> 38:09.800
Are we just gonna stand here?

38:10.419 --> 38:12.469
We can't just charge in and start shooting.

38:12.505 --> 38:13.837
Pretty sure we can.

38:14.223 --> 38:15.389
Hey, keep your hands off these people.

38:15.424 --> 38:16.557
What the hell do you think you're doing?

38:16.592 --> 38:18.475
- Following orders.
- That's Miller's pal.

38:18.511 --> 38:21.395
Yeah, I didn't get any orders
anything like this. You stand down.

38:21.430 --> 38:22.513
I've got rank here.

38:22.565 --> 38:23.731
Not today, you don't.

38:23.766 --> 38:25.649
Sir, sir, we're trying to...

38:44.003 --> 38:45.703
- We got a man down!
- What the hell is this?

38:45.755 --> 38:46.787
He needs medical attention.

38:46.839 --> 38:48.288
I can see that, but who the hell are you?

38:48.290 --> 38:50.791
Hey, some of your guys are taking
fire down that connector shaft.

38:50.793 --> 38:52.194
- You want to check it out.
- We'll take care of him.

38:52.219 --> 38:53.595
You stay right there.

38:53.629 --> 38:54.628
Open the door.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.797
They said, once it's shut, it stays shut.

39:00.803 --> 39:03.637
All right, all right. You'll be all right.

39:15.818 --> 39:17.868
Jesus.

39:18.704 --> 39:19.703
What...

39:35.755 --> 39:36.754
Get out!

39:37.089 --> 39:38.138
Get out!

39:38.340 --> 39:39.923
What...

39:42.895 --> 39:44.511
What the hell was that?

39:50.352 --> 39:52.903
We just got hit with a
mega-dose of hard radiation.

39:54.857 --> 39:56.273
How bad?

40:02.698 --> 40:04.031
We're dead.

40:09.622 --> 40:11.004
Attention.

40:11.206 --> 40:15.143
Eros Station has experienced
a radiation hazard breach...
