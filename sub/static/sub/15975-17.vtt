<i>F 2...3.., F</i>

21:45.972 --> 21:47.667
<i>F 2...3.., F</i>

21:49.609 --> 21:50.906
-- Is it noticeable?
-- The bandage?

21:50.977 --> 21:52.445
-- Yes.
-- No.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.742
-- Except you just noticed it.
-- I didn't notice it.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.475
I asked you,
"Did you notice it?"

21:56.549 --> 21:58.381
And you said,
"What, the bandage?"

21:58.451 --> 22:00.749
-- I guessed at it.
-- Really?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.686
-- You used powers of suggestion.
-- Really?

22:02.755 --> 22:04.723
You have a bandage the size
of a sleeping bag

22:04.791 --> 22:06.589
on your face, Dana.
Of course it's noticeable.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.821
-- Yes.
-- But you look fine.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.590
The question --
the real question --

22:10.663 --> 22:12.688
the question is
where do you put Tommy Castro?

22:12.765 --> 22:14.062
-- Fifth in the second.
-- No!

22:14.133 --> 22:15.396
San Diego's gonna
take him fifth.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.493
San Diego doesn't
need help outside.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.801
Not now, but they're gonna trade Dobson up for
the 17th pick in the first round. You watch.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.342
Castro to San Diego
in the second?

22:23.409 --> 22:25.605
-- Yeah.
-- All right.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.703
Castro's an attractive man.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.509
-- Natalie...
-- I'm just saying.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.107
Just saying what?

22:31.184 --> 22:33.050
That I find his taut
and muscular body

22:33.119 --> 22:35.053
and piercing green eyes
to be attractive

22:35.121 --> 22:36.919
and that I'd like
to have sex with him.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.151
You need to calm down.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.193
I should call him up
and tell him that.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.819
Yeah, that's what you
want to do.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.886
It's 2:20 in the morning. We've
been here for almost two hours.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.989
-- You want to go home?
-- No, I'm just saying.

22:47.066 --> 22:47.999
You're just saying what?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.967
I'm saying
where are the men?!

22:50.837 --> 22:53.238
I'm saying
what happened to the boys?

22:53.306 --> 22:56.241
I've been telling you, Natalie, they all
went off to fight Germany and Japan.

22:56.309 --> 22:58.403
Best we can do
is sell war bonds

22:58.478 --> 23:00.412
and give them a dance
at the USO.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.915
-- What happened to men hitting
on women in bars? -- Uh-huh.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.814
It's 2:00 A.M.,
I'm obviously drunk,

23:04.884 --> 23:06.352
and I'm sitting here!

23:06.419 --> 23:08.478
-- Natalie...
-- Sorry, <i>Jack.</i>

23:08.554 --> 23:10.181
See, you got us in trouble.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.621
Jack's cute.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.717
Natalie, we've got
a 3-hour broadcast tomorrow.

23:14.794 --> 23:18.526
Seriously, we've got
to finish the prep.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.828
I'm thinking about
getting drunk tonight.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.732
Okay.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.499
Whitson, Woodson,
Rofofsky --

23:25.571 --> 23:28.199
17,18,19.

23:28.274 --> 23:30.868
-- Look at it again.
-- I looked at it enough.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.139
Or maybe Tommy Castro.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.546
-- You want me to read it out loud? --
No, it's not gonna be Tommy Castro.

23:36.616 --> 23:40.519
It's from professional golf's
very own David Duval.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.486
You know, I don't think it's
gonna be Tommy Castro.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.886
I don't think
it's gonna be Castro

23:43.956 --> 23:45.822
because I think Cap Harris
knows something

23:45.892 --> 23:47.417
about his knees
that I don't know.

23:47.493 --> 23:50.121
PGA superstar David Duval.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.664
-- Natalie.
-- Yeah?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.665
I want to know more
about Tommy Castro's knees.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.428
You and me both,
sailor man.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.162
-- What the hell?
-- She's fine.

23:57.236 --> 24:01.571
There is a skill.
There is an art.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.803
There's an art
to Draft Day predictions.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.174
There's an art to
winning money from Dana.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.942
It's like getting a fine hound
to swallow a pill.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.109
Excuse me. Hi. Would you
mind reading that?

24:11.184 --> 24:12.549
Sure.

24:16.022 --> 24:16.853
Out loud.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.717
Uh, "To Dan Rydell."

24:20.793 --> 24:22.625
-- That's me.
-- I'm Karen.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.185
I don't care.
I need you to keep reading.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.827
"4:00 P.M. Saturday
at Alpine.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.062
-- <i>See you in the sand trap."</i>
-- <i>Read who it's from.</i>

24:30.136 --> 24:32.230
-- "David Dynel."
-- That's David Duval.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.137
-- I-It looks like a
-- No, it's a

24:34.207 --> 24:35.572
Okay.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.406
-- That's a phone message from
David Duval to me. -- <i>Yes...</i>

24:38.478 --> 24:40.674
-- <i>The</i> David <i>Duval.</i> -- <i>The
guy from "The Godfather"?</i>

24:40.746 --> 24:43.010
-- That's Robert Duvall.
-- The actor.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.346
Yes, I'm talking about
David Duval, the golfer.

24:45.418 --> 24:46.613
I don't know who he is.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.154
Well, I'm playing golf
with him tomorrow.

24:48.221 --> 24:49.882
And if you knew who he was,
you'd think that was cool.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.653
<i>Danny, please stop hitting on
women in bars who aren't me!</i>

24:52.725 --> 24:53.783
Natalie...

24:53.860 --> 24:54.952
Sorry, Jack.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.291
If Casey's taking Whitson,
Woodson, and Rofofsky --

24:57.363 --> 25:00.333
17 up -- that means he knows
something about Tommy Castro's knees

25:00.399 --> 25:02.094
he's not sharing
with the rest of us.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.728
And for that, I'm afraid he's
gonna have to pay a price.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.136
A crisp $100 bill
would do nicely!

25:07.206 --> 25:08.435
Dana.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.703
Sorry, Jack.

25:09.775 --> 25:12.369
A crisp $100 bill from Casey.

25:12.445 --> 25:14.277
A Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.145
Casey changed his name
to Abraham Lincoln?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.582
-- No, on the $100 bill.
-- Benjamin Franklin.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.141
Okey-dokey, then.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.687
<i>Do you think
if Benjamin Franklin</i>

25:21.754 --> 25:23.483
was in this bar right now,
<i>he'd</i> try to hit on me?

more than the first round tomorrow.

<i>I love Draft Day.</i>

25:29.095 --> 25:31.086
I live for Draft Day

25:31.163 --> 25:34.292

a <i>$100 bill in his teeth.</i>

25:34.367 --> 25:35.391
I like Draft Day, too.

25:35.468 --> 25:36.526
Yeah, it's a great day.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.229
[Glasses clink]
To Draft Day.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.380
Here are the rules.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.713
I know the rules.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.911
[Chuckles] We're gonna
go over the rules.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.078
I know the rules.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.383
Yeah, but what's the fun
of playing a game

25:56.455 --> 25:57.581
if you're not gonna
go over the rules?

25:57.657 --> 25:59.591
Yes, that's the fun part.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.649
The following are the rules.

26:00.726 --> 26:01.454
You're such a loser.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.120
All predictions must be made

26:03.195 --> 26:05.527
-- before the commissioner
reaches the podium. -- Yes.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.124
Okay, those were the rules.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.294
Can we go over
that first one again?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.565
By the way, it's Benjamin
Franklin on the $100 bill.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.197
Who said it wasn't?

26:14.273 --> 26:16.139
Nobody. I'm just saying
if maybe you thought

26:16.208 --> 26:18.336
-- it was Abraham Lincoln...
-- No.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.210
-- Don't you just love Draft Day?
-- Yes, I do.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.611
[Chuckles] Don't you wish
we were covering more

26:22.682 --> 26:24.810
-- than the first round?
-- Yes, I do.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.216
You know something about Tommy
Castro's knees, don't you?

26:27.286 --> 26:29.050
Well, just, you know,
what everybody knows.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.486
-- Yeah?
-- Yeah.

26:30.556 --> 26:31.489
Okay.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.651
-- Hey, Jeremy.
-- Hey, Jeremy.

26:33.726 --> 26:36.593
Hello.
What's happening now?

26:36.662 --> 26:38.255
Nothing. I'm leaving.

26:38.331 --> 26:39.765
-- Ah.
-- To go.

26:39.832 --> 26:40.822
Okay.

26:42.401 --> 26:43.732
She's cooked.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.794
Hey, what's a choreo-animator?

26:45.871 --> 26:48.340
-- A choreo-animator? I don't know.
-- Yeah.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.966
VVell, I was on the elevator, and
somebody said to somebody else

26:50.042 --> 26:51.567
that they were
a choreo-animator.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.636
-- I don't know.
-- That's troublesome.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.875
Hey.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.415
-- You know something about
Tommy Castro's knees? -- No.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.787
Whitson, Castro,
Woodson, Rofofsky.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.622
Heh-hey, Draft Day, baby!

27:07.693 --> 27:10.424
-- Yes, indeed... [High-pitcheq] baby!
-- [ Cheenng]

27:10.496 --> 27:12.089
You ever notice
how I can't say "baby"

27:12.164 --> 27:14.132
-- without sounding ridiculous?
-- I have noticed that.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.964
There are lots of words
I can't use that I'd like to.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.161
-- Like what?
-- "Dang."

27:17.236 --> 27:18.931
You know,
I see what you mean.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.131
I have uses for that.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.970
Say, Jeremy...

27:22.041 --> 27:23.167
-- Dan told you.
-- Yes.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.370
That was so
unbelievably predictable.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.469
So as to not even
merit discussion,

27:27.546 --> 27:29.378
-- so let's move on.
-- Oh, let's do.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.574
You're dating a porn star?

27:31.751 --> 27:33.845
I have met and spent
social time

27:33.919 --> 27:37.014
with an actress who appears
in adult films, yes.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.080
How you manage to make

library is beyond me.</i>

27:41.360 --> 27:42.657
Well, dang, Casey.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.288
-- What's her name? -- Her
real name or her screen name?

27:45.364 --> 27:47.526
-- <i>Screen name.</i>
-- <i>Well, I won't tell you that.</i>

27:47.600 --> 27:49.898
-- VVell, what's her real name?
-- Jenny.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.199
-- Oh, so this is pretty serious.
-- I/VeH, <i>I</i> know her real name,

27:52.271 --> 27:54.239
so, I mean, we're at that
point in our relationship.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.774
Seriously, Jeremy,
you like her?

27:55.841 --> 27:57.309
I really do.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.676
-- <i>Does she like sports?</i> -- <i>She
likes sports. We talk about sports.</i>

28:00.746 --> 28:03.078
You're dating a porn star
who likes sports?

28:03.149 --> 28:04.412
I know, that's why I'm not
talking about it.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.076
<i>Any minute now my mother's
gonna wake me up</i>

28:06.152 --> 28:07.517
and tell me it's time
to go to school.

28:07.586 --> 28:11.216
Oh, well, the thing is, while you
may not be talking about it,

28:11.290 --> 28:13.850
-- other people are.
-- People know about Jenny?

28:13.926 --> 28:15.189
People know you're
seeing someone,

28:15.294 --> 28:16.659
but they don't know what she
does except for Danny and me.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.697
See your way clear to keeping
it that way, if you could.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.027
-- Yeah, but I'm just
saying -- -- Natalie.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.294
She knows you're
seeing somebody,

28:21.367 --> 28:22.835
and I thought maybe you
could say a word to her

28:22.902 --> 28:24.097
to let the healing
process begin

28:24.170 --> 28:25.865
so there could be a process
of healing that could begin.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.428
Why are you talking
like somebody

28:27.506 --> 28:30.168
who didn't get the lecture
notes for Intro to Psych?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.438
Jeremy, there are icicles growing
off the ceiling of this place.

28:32.511 --> 28:36.345
-- There is tension here -- tension
on Draft Day. -- That shouldn't be.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.009
No, and as the kind of ad hoc
director of morale around here --

28:39.085 --> 28:40.211
-- You're the director of morale?
-- Yeah.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.981
-- When did that happen? --
VVell, it was ad hoc. -- Okay.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.079
-- So...y0u'll maybe say a word to her?
-- Yeah, thanks.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.683
All right. So, Whitson,
Castro, Woodson --

28:47.760 --> 28:48.921

28:48.994 --> 28:50.155
Great.

Jenny...

28:51.897 --> 28:53.922
Was she in "Deep Throat"?

28:53.999 --> 28:55.296
Yeah, Casey,
I'm dating a porn star

28:55.367 --> 28:56.801

of my grandmother.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.803
Well, I got to get into a
video store one of these days.

28:58.871 --> 28:59.929
I am missing
this whole thing.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.440

No, just fell down.

They're very sharp.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.570
See how I played the "day"
and the "night" off each other?

29:33.639 --> 29:36.165
-- Oscar VVilde would have been proud.
-- [Laughs]

29:36.242 --> 29:38.176
-- Next year, Isaac.
-- Dana...

29:38.244 --> 29:40.838
Next year, you got to
make them do it.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.143
-- Listen... -- It's not enough
just covering the first round.

29:43.215 --> 29:46.310
We've got to cover at least
the first two rounds, at least.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.251
-- Dana...
-- At minimum.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.879
-- What is that?!
-- Open it.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.047
-- It's for me?
-- Yes.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.488
-- What is it?
-- Open it!

29:54.360 --> 29:56.089
-- It's a fax.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

29:56.162 --> 29:59.154
-- What's it say? -- You're
holding it in your hands.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.528
[Sighs ] "With rain
threatening to wash out

30:00.599 --> 30:02.499
"scheduled coverage
at Indian Wells,

30:02.568 --> 30:04.798
"please be prepared
to stay on the air

30:04.870 --> 30:07.896
an additional --"
[Gasps ] Oh, my God!

30:07.973 --> 30:09.737
-- How 'bout that?
-- The second round.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.538
If it rains at Indian Wells.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.511
-- We're gonna cover the second round!
-- <i>If it</i> rains.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.412
-- Make sure it rains.
-- <i>I'll</i> try.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.041
Don't try, Isaac.
Get it done.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.552
Anyway, get everybody
set just in case.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.178
You better believe it, baby!

30:22.254 --> 30:23.346
Okay.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.857
The T-shirts are 100% cotton.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.019
Okay. [Laughs]

30:28.093 --> 30:30.323
Jack Jankowicz is in Baltimore.
Kelly's in St. Louis.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.194
We added two more staffers
at the Garden.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.824
-- Natalie, you know what would make you a
better golfer? -- Learning to play <i>golf?</i>

30:34.900 --> 30:36.664
Focusing less on results.

30:36.735 --> 30:37.930
Carol and Tim --

30:38.003 --> 30:39.437
You know, golf is 50% mental.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.269
I'm beginning to think
that so are you, Dan.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.830
<i>Guess what --
guess what's happened.</i>

30:42.908 --> 30:44.273
You bought T-shirts
for everybody.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.868
I did buy T-shirts for
everybody, but --

30:45.945 --> 30:48.312
Dana, how you spend your time
and money sometimes amazes me.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.872
-- VVell, I got a deal. --
Please tell me they were free.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.214
I thought people
might like them.

30:53.285 --> 30:56.653
Absolutely. Now if you'll just bring
out the juice and crackers --

30:56.722 --> 30:58.486
Stop it.
What's going on?

30:58.557 --> 31:00.821
Man, Danny, no wonder Casey
can't stand you these days.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.362
-- Dana! -- Sorry. It might
rain at Indian VVells.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.955
If it does, we stay on the air
for the second round.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.157
Excellent.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.530
W-What are you
talking about?

31:08.601 --> 31:10.228
It might rain
at Indian Wells.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.566
-- I heard that part. -- If it
does, we stay on the air --

31:12.638 --> 31:14.299
-- I'm not staying on the air.
-- Of course you are.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.431
-- No, I'm not.
-- Why not?

31:15.507 --> 31:16.599
I'm playing golf
this afternoon.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.303
-- You play golf many afternoons.
-- This is David Duval.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.142
With whom you play golf
three times a year.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.544
And with whom I'm playing
golf this afternoon.

31:22.615 --> 31:24.549
Well, not if it rains
at Indian Wells.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.779
I don't care if it snows in Saskatchewan.
I had plans.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.786
-- <i>Dan...</i> -- <i>Casey can anchor
the second round by himself.</i>

31:28.854 --> 31:30.913
<i>I know, but it's better
if he has a partner.</i>

31:30.990 --> 31:34.893
-- Better for who? -- Whom, Dan.
Better for whom.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.257
Dana --

31:36.328 --> 31:40.094
Better for the show.
Take care of this.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.329
Dan.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.701
Natalie, this is my 13th day
in a row working.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.240
-- And everyone appreciates it. --
Do you understand -- this sucks.

31:48.307 --> 31:49.399
I had plans, too, Danny.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.307
I was gonna hang around
construction sites, but --

31:51.377 --> 31:53.345
-- I'm not doing it.
-- You say that now.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.847
I'm gonna say it later, too.
I'm not doing it.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.680
<i>Kim: Five minutes to air.
First team in the studio.</i>

31:58.751 --> 32:00.651
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.856
-- 10 seconds live.
-- Stand by sound.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.560
Stand by F/X-1, -2, and -2A.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.102
-- Natalie... -- Don't worry about it.
He'll be fine.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.398
Good show, everybody.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.995
In 3...2...

32:20.072 --> 32:21.972
<i>Good morning.
From New York City,</i>

32:22.041 --> 32:24.135
<i>I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell</i>

32:24.209 --> 32:28.077
for a special CSC presentation
of Draft Day 2000.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.047
We'll have all
the first-round action

32:30.115 --> 32:32.550
from Madison Square Garden,
including analyses,

32:32.618 --> 32:34.518
predictions, reactions,
and more.

32:34.586 --> 32:35.781
Here's how we play our game.

32:35.854 --> 32:37.879
Teams have 15 minutes
to make their selection.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.482
Once they do,
the general manager

32:39.558 --> 32:41.356
will join the commissioner
at the podium

32:41.427 --> 32:43.088
to let some young man's
parents know

32:43.162 --> 32:45.290
their son won't be needing
his allowance anymore.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.731
-- <i>Stand</i> by <i>4.</i> -- <i>Cleveland's on the
clock with the first selection,</i>

32:47.800 --> 32:49.894
and with that, we take you
to Kelly Kirkpatrick

32:49.969 --> 32:52.097
-- live at the Garden. Kelly?
Dave: We're <i>out.</i>

32:52.171 --> 32:55.232
This is stand by. I'll get a 30-second
cue from the Garden on comeback.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.935
Garden, don't leave me in the woods here.
Give me the 411, the whole ride.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.068
We are underway.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.374
We are underway...
[Dramatically] baby!

33:01.447 --> 33:03.211
That didn't work.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.875
-- No, that was good.
-- I sounded like an idiot.

33:04.950 --> 33:05.815
It was sweet.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.409
-- Here's the part I don't understand.
-- Absolutely.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.147
-- I will never understand this part.
-- And neither will I.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.588
Cleveland's had four months
to make this decision.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.092
And yet rather than go up on stage and
tell the world what it already knows...

33:14.159 --> 33:16.093
They're gonna take
the 15 minutes.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.323
15 minutes of sitting
around and waiting.

33:18.397 --> 33:21.196
-- 15 minutes where we have no
responsibilities at all. Dana: <i>Excuse me...</i>

33:21.266 --> 33:25.225
Are you asking if it's okay if you go
get a danish from the guy downstairs?

33:25.304 --> 33:26.635
They're the really
good ones today.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.571
-- Get me cinnamon. -- Cheese.
-- Prune.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.903
-- Cheese. -- Cinnamon.
-- Prune?

33:29.975 --> 33:30.999
-- It's good.
-- Prune.

33:31.076 --> 33:32.976
-- Did you get all that? -- No,
but I don't care that much.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.446
You know, I don't see a lot
of people wearing T-shirts here.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.812
In fact, I see a total
of, hmm, none.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.510
I'm saving mine
for a special occasion.

33:39.585 --> 33:40.950
-- Like what?
-- Labor Day.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.647
It's a Draft Day T-shirt,
Jeremy.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.053
You're supposed to be
wearing it on Draft Day.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.991
Dana, the T-shirt says, “I survived
Draft Day,“ which I've not yet done.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.289
He's got a point.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.352
-- Shut up!
-— Okay,

33:51.430 --> 33:53.660
-- Stretching my legs.
-- Stay close.

33:53.732 --> 33:54.631
-- Why does he have to say that?
-- <i>Look...</i>

33:54.700 --> 33:56.361
Why does he have to say
he's stretching his legs

33:56.435 --> 33:57.368
when he's obviously --

33:57.436 --> 33:58.904
-- Draft Day spirit, Natalie.
-- I'm just saying.

33:58.971 --> 34:01.065
-- You're just saying what? --
He calls her four times a day.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.472
We went out for a year. He never
called me four times in a day.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.704
You worked together
from noon to midnight.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.576
I have a desk, Dana.
I have an extension.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.080
-- Yes.
-- Totally unencumbered.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.139
Any man who wanted to
could just have me right now.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.783
Sit down!

34:14.786 --> 34:17.848
“A“ -- it might not rain. “B“ -- if it
rains, you play with him some other time.

34:17.922 --> 34:19.891
-- Whatever. -- VVant to
help me with my picks?

34:19.958 --> 34:22.928
Whitson, Woodson, Rofofsky.
Casey, what's the trouble?

34:22.995 --> 34:24.463
<i>Whhson' Castro,
Woodsman' Roioisky.</i>

34:24.530 --> 34:26.089
See, neither you nor
Dana have mastered

34:26.165 --> 34:27.826
what we like to call
the art of the hunt.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.926
Dana thinks I know something
about Castro's knees,

34:31.003 --> 34:32.232
which I do not.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.237
This is what we like to call
the classic psych-out.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.364
Casey?

34:35.440 --> 34:36.533
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:36.608 --> 34:38.770
I'm listening
to you, you know.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.607
I know.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.777
See, this is still part
of the psych-out.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.342
I'm gonna go lie down
on the couch in editing.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.853
Hey, we could be back
any second.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.254
It takes 15 minutes, Casey.
It always takes 15 minutes.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.813
<i>The day it takes less
than 15 minutes</i>

34:53.891 --> 34:55.587
is the day the sky falls down.
Somebody shout for me.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.390
-- Hello.
-- <i>Hello.</i>

34:57.463 --> 34:59.761
Dan, I need you close.

34:59.832 --> 35:01.766
Dana, I'm going
to the damn editing room.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.324
Okay!

35:04.970 --> 35:06.734
Uh...uh-huh.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.068
3:00.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.130
Hey.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.334
I'm totally fine with this.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.002
-- He's making me crazy.
-- Really, I'm fine.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.169
If you were here,
you'd look at me,

35:13.245 --> 35:15.771
-- you'd say, "He looks fine."
-- He looks fine.

35:15.848 --> 35:17.043
3:00.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.409
-- Well...
-- Was that her?

35:20.486 --> 35:21.817
Jenny.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.185
-- Was that her?
-- Yes.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.623
I'm walking the shadowy line
between honesty and not.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.558
[Chuckles]
What'd you do?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.686
I want to be out in the open about this.
I don't want to make her feel like --

35:30.762 --> 35:33.459
She's paid to have sex with, like, a
hundred different guys on camera?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.296
Like I'm ashamed of her,
yeah.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.994
So you invited her over here

35:37.069 --> 35:39.060
-- Yeah.
-- to show her to the gang.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.163
<i>-- Yeah. -- And tell
everyone what she does?</i>

35:41.240 --> 35:42.173
If they ask, yeah.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.936
-- <i>Okay.</i>
-- <i>If they ask.</i>

35:44.009 --> 35:45.670
I'm not making a cover story.
I mean, I can't think

35:45.744 --> 35:48.679
-- of anything that'd be more
insulting than making -- -- Yeah.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.408
The thing is, the first
round will be done by 2:00,

35:50.482 --> 35:52.814
and I told her to come at 3:00, when I
knew Natalie wasn't gonna be here anymore.

35:52.885 --> 35:54.876
-- Yeah. -- <i>I'm feeling
kind of bad about that.</i>

35:54.953 --> 35:56.079
Well, cheer up then.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.919
-- Why? -- If it rains
at Indian VVells,

35:57.990 --> 35:59.754
we're covering
the second round.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.953
-- What <i>do you</i> mean? -- <i>If
it rains at Indian I/VeHs,</i>

36:02.027 --> 36:04.121
-- we're covering the second round.
-- <i>I don't</i> understand.

36:04.196 --> 36:06.961
If it rains at Indian VVells,
we're covering the second round.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.966
The second round will take
us to 6:00, maybe 7:00.

36:09.034 --> 36:11.093
-- I <i>told</i> Jenny <i>to come at 3:00.</i>
-- <i>Maybe she'll be fate.</i>

36:11.170 --> 36:14.401
-- She won't be late. -- She's
a pretty punctual porn star?

36:14.473 --> 36:16.305
-- Dan... -- I like alliteration.
Take it easy.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.901
It cannot, it must not rain
at Indian Wells.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.911
Hey, I got a tee time with
David Duval, so get in line.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.846
Though, interestingly, it was a
rainstorm that ended our first fight.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.975
-- Interesting. -- All right,
back to being panicked.

36:26.051 --> 36:27.246
It cannot...

36:27.319 --> 36:29.720
it must not rain
at Indian Wells.

36:32.824 --> 36:33.985
Hello.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.390
-- Hello.
-- Hello.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.586
What are you doing?

36:36.662 --> 36:38.892
Demonstrating to Casey
that he can't psych me out.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.592
I've made my Draft Day predictions.
I'm not changing them.

36:41.667 --> 36:44.466
Okay, well, this is really stupid,
and I need to talk to Casey, so...

36:44.536 --> 36:45.662
-- Danish.
-- Uh, hang on, hang on.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.501
I am breaking
eye contact now,

36:47.573 --> 36:50.008
but not because you've won
some battle of the mind,

36:50.075 --> 36:52.009
but because
the danish is here.

36:52.077 --> 36:53.511
I'm breaking...now.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.513
You guys seriously
need to calm down.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.912
-- <i>I know.</i>
-- What's up?

36:56.982 --> 36:59.747
I'm walking the shadowy line
between honesty and deceit.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.480
Ah, I know that line well.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.353
One need only to think
back to Dana and Gordon

37:05.424 --> 37:08.189
and Sally and me and Dana
and Sally and Gordon.

37:08.260 --> 37:11.992
Right, but this is my thing, and this is
now, so let's not think back so much.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.761
Jenny's coming here at 3:00, which
I thought was both wise and good

37:14.833 --> 37:18.360
since I wanted to show Jenny that I'm prepared
to be totally upfront about who she is.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.236
-- VVhile still avoiding telling
Natalie who she is. -- Yes.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.603
-- Indian Wells.
-- Yes.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.073
-- Chance of rain.
-- Yes.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.133
-- Second-round coverage.
-- Yes.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.872
-- Jeremy Goodwin... totally screwed.
-- Yes.

37:27.946 --> 37:31.246
-- You like Draft Day, don't you? -- To
an admittedly psychotic extent, yes.

37:31.316 --> 37:32.579
See, and that's
another thing, too,

37:32.651 --> 37:34.551
'cause I'd like to be rooting
for rain at Indian Wells.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.883
I wanted to go
to the second round.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.285
-- But now?
-- Not so much.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.653
Jeremy, listen to me.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.715
Why don't you just
rip the bandage off,

37:40.792 --> 37:42.988
bite the bullet,
swallow hard, and tell her?

37:43.061 --> 37:46.622
You got to stop living in fear and start
rooting for rain at Indian VVells.

37:46.698 --> 37:47.631
-- Yes!
-- Good!

37:47.699 --> 37:49.224
-- That makes sense to me.
-- Good.

37:49.301 --> 37:50.894
-- That makes complete sense.
-- Yes.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.768
-- I will go.
-- And yet you stand here.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.240
Yes...okay.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.867
I will go.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.372
-- <i>It's Draft Day, Alyson.</i>
-- <i>Yeah.</i>

38:01.446 --> 38:02.880
-- Nothin' like it.
-- Yep.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.973
-- You know what Draft Day is?
-- <i>Nope.</i>

38:05.050 --> 38:05.983
Okay.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.145
I'm good-looking,
I'm smart,

38:08.220 --> 38:11.383
career-oriented,
I have <i>sass.</i>

38:11.456 --> 38:13.151
-- You smell good.
-- I smell great.

38:13.225 --> 38:14.818
-- Okay.
-- I'm just saying...

38:14.893 --> 38:16.861
-- Natalie. Just the woman
I'm looking for. -- Hello.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.327
Coming out of
the mouth of anyone

38:18.397 --> 38:20.525
but the guy I just broke up
with, that'd make my day.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.829
I broke up with you, but that
seems neither here nor there.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.062
Can I talk to you
a second?

38:24.136 --> 38:25.262
I broke up with you there,

38:25.337 --> 38:27.032
Mr. "Obviously has
a short-term memory loss

38:27.105 --> 38:28.402
"with a myriad
of other problems

38:28.473 --> 38:29.668
"which I won't even
go into,

38:29.741 --> 38:31.072
"but thinks that
he broke up with me

38:31.143 --> 38:33.168
because of the short-term memory
loss, which is so obvious.“

38:33.245 --> 38:35.839
No need to be formal. I've seen you naked.
Call me Jeremy.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.848
-- What do you want?
-- Can I talk to you in there?

38:37.916 --> 38:39.350
Sure.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.117
Yes?

38:44.189 --> 38:45.247
Hi.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.382
Hi!

38:46.458 --> 38:49.325
So, aren't you just nuts
about Draft Day?

38:49.394 --> 38:50.589
Jeremy, I know
you're seeing someone.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.426
Yeah, well, look,
first of all,

38:52.497 --> 38:56.058
I just met her recently, and I've
only seen her a couple of times.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.933
-- You don't have to apologize.
-- VVell, I'm not apologizing.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.803
-- Okay. -- I'm sorry you had to
hear it through the grapevine.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.570
-- That's where you hear things. --
Yeah, I should have told you, though.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.475
Well, I'm not sure
you're right,

39:06.545 --> 39:08.479
but you obviously
made an effort,

39:08.547 --> 39:10.914
and I appreciate your bravery
and honesty in coming to me.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.541
And I appreciate
your saying that,

39:12.617 --> 39:14.915
and I appreciate your
being cool about it.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.250
Jeremy, please, I'm gonna walk out
of here, and I'm gonna break things,

39:17.322 --> 39:18.619
-- but for right now, in --
-- Yeah.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.658
You're an upfront guy,
Jeremy.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.717
You should stay that way.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.922
I'll try.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.431
-- What does she do?
-- Hmm?

39:27.499 --> 39:28.864
What does she do?

39:28.934 --> 39:31.198
-- For a living?
-- Yeah.

39:31.269 --> 39:34.398
She's a professional
choreo-animator.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.998
-- Really? What is that?
-- Yeah.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.166
-- What is it?
-- Yeah.

39:37.242 --> 39:38.505
What does it sound
like to you?

39:38.577 --> 39:40.841
It sounds like
she makes up dance steps

39:40.912 --> 39:42.539
for cartoon characters.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.481
Wow. That's exactly
what it is.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.178
She makes up dance steps
for cartoon characters?

39:48.253 --> 39:49.687
-- You got a problem with that?
-- No.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.689
Any reason I should be
ashamed of that?

39:51.757 --> 39:54.089
She makes up dance steps
for cartoon characters?

39:54.159 --> 39:56.685
VVell, it's not like they make them
up themselves, now, is it, Natalie?

39:56.762 --> 39:58.696
-- You're right.
-- Yes.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.391
-- Okay.
-- I have to go now.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.559
<i>Are you going far?</i>

40:02.634 --> 40:04.500
If only I could.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.167
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

40:11.243 --> 40:14.838
They really needed the whole
damn 15 minutes, huh?

40:14.913 --> 40:17.883
VVell, Dan, I think they want to be sure about
their decisions before they put $10 million

40:17.949 --> 40:20.646
and the future of a football
team in a guy's hands.

40:20.719 --> 40:21.880
What's your problem?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.717
[Sighs]

40:25.791 --> 40:28.260
-- <i>Where'd you go, man?</i>
-- <i>I've been here.</i>

40:28.326 --> 40:30.761
No, you didn't come into work today.
You haven't come into work in a week.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.196
Everybody here would like to be
playing golf with David Duval.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.290
Everybody here would like to
be with their new girlfriend

40:35.367 --> 40:36.801
or back with
their old boyfriend

40:36.868 --> 40:38.666
or with their wife in Connecticut
or getting a danish,

40:38.737 --> 40:41.536
but more than that,
they'd rather be here.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.735
-- VVhere'd you go? -- You know, Casey,
I'm getting a little tired of you

40:44.810 --> 40:47.404
-- <i>being senior camp counselor around here.</i>
-- <i>[Clears throat]</i>

40:47.479 --> 40:49.743
<i>I come to work. I do
my job. I do it well.</i>

40:49.815 --> 40:52.546
Maybe not well enough to
be 92nd on the list...

40:52.617 --> 40:54.915
-- <i>Oh, come on,</i> Danny.
-- <i>but I do it well enough.</i>

40:54.986 --> 40:56.385
-- You know what I'm talking about.
-- Leave me alone.

40:56.455 --> 40:59.015
Hey, you know what? If you're
not here, then I can't use you.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.752
You can't "use" me?

41:02.828 --> 41:05.559
[Sighs ] That's right.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.327
-- When did I become Ed McMahon to you? --
No, you're not, and you know it, all right?

41:08.400 --> 41:09.890
But I need to be able
to do my show.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.595
And when did it become
your show?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.434
Come on, we're on the air.

41:13.505 --> 41:14.904
[Door hinges creak]

41:16.508 --> 41:18.272
You had to make fun
of Dana's T-shirts?

41:18.343 --> 41:19.401
We'll talk about it later.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.446
-- Hey, Jeremy, we're back.
-- Yeah.

41:21.513 --> 41:25.177
-- How'd it go? -- I'm still
living in that shadowy place.

41:25.250 --> 41:28.083
Casey, Dan, I'm transferring live
footage to your monitors. Take a look.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.458
It's raining at Indian Wells.

41:34.526 --> 41:35.618
Oh, God.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.025
<i>Dave." In 10.</i>

41:41.766 --> 41:46.033
In 5...4...3...2...1.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.134
So the newest member
of the fraternity

41:51.209 --> 41:53.610
of professional athletes
has just been selected,

41:53.678 --> 41:55.646
and something tells me
this is just the beginning.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.409
<i>Stay with us
for all the action</i>

41:57.482 --> 42:00.884

two rounds of Draft Day 2000.</i>
