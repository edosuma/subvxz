WEBVTT

00:02.302 --> 00:05.430
 Work at a hospital long enough,
you get used to anything.

00:05.505 --> 00:10.169
Whether it's Dr. Kim, who makes patients
take their pants off no matter what...

00:10.243 --> 00:12.177
Yep, you've got pink eye.

00:12.245 --> 00:14.213
Can I put my pants back on?

00:14.280 --> 00:16.043
Right after I put some drops in.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.580
Or nobody remembering
Ray Ketay's 80th birthday.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.985
Why aren't you making
a bigger fuss?

00:23.056 --> 00:25.115
Uh, I would have, Mr. Ketay,

00:25.191 --> 00:29.355
but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge
celebration for you later.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.397
 I should tell her about that.

00:31.464 --> 00:35.366
Truth is, thanks to modern medicine,
80 isn't that big a deal anymore.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.993
It's not like the olden days.

00:37.704 --> 00:42.004
Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams.

00:42.075 --> 00:45.135
He was 12. He led a full life.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.111
He will be missed.

00:47.180 --> 00:50.240
Especially by his
beautiful wife, Jenny,

00:50.316 --> 00:53.683
who stood by him,
even when he turned six,

00:53.753 --> 00:54.913
had a midlife crisis,

00:55.021 --> 00:58.582
and was caught banging one of those
naked people that brought us corn.

00:59.292 --> 01:02.591
I'd be the oldest man
in Pilgrim Village.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.187
 Still, you should
always celebrate life

01:05.265 --> 01:08.200
because you never know when
it will throw you a curveball.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.826
Like with Dr. Cox.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.736
He recently made a decision
any doctor would have made,

01:12.806 --> 01:15.570
and because of it,
three patients died.

01:17.644 --> 01:20.306
At first, he was inconsolably sad.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.708
After that, he started acting out.

01:30.523 --> 01:34.015
In his defense, he did ask
for dressing on the side.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.224
Daphne!

01:37.831 --> 01:40.493
I heard that he attacked
one of the busboys.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.127
Yeah, I heard he
bitchslapped the maitre d'.

01:43.236 --> 01:46.000
Enough, gang.
That's how rumors get started.

01:46.072 --> 01:48.768
Gloria, I made a joke that
you hooked up with Leonard,

01:48.842 --> 01:52.608
the security guard with the hookhand,
now everyone thinks it's true.

01:52.679 --> 01:56.206
It is true. And I'm never going back.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.147
Gloria!

01:59.452 --> 02:01.386
I love me some white meat.

02:02.222 --> 02:06.522
OK... well, make sure you put
antiseptic on any puncture wounds, OK?

02:06.593 --> 02:10.154
Now I know Dr. Cox seems
crazy mad at the world right now,

02:10.263 --> 02:12.629
but let's remember,
three patients died.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.292
What's amazing is that
he can take a hit like that,

02:15.401 --> 02:17.665
one that would knock any of us
out for good,

02:17.737 --> 02:19.671
and come out still standing.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.902
That's why the man's an inspiration.
I mean, he is a rock.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.910
 Yep, he's the best damn doctor here.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.346
Newbie, give me a little trouble?
I'm having some help here.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.609
Oh, no.

02:31.384 --> 02:34.842
# I can't do this all on my own

02:34.921 --> 02:38.482
# No, I know I'm no Superman

02:41.427 --> 02:43.361
# I'm no Superman #

02:45.031 --> 02:47.158
All right, people, listen up.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.791
We are a family.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.871
And what do families do when
one of their own is in trouble?

02:51.938 --> 02:55.806
When my brother came out of the closet
my parents sent him to hetero camp.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.740
Families not from Connecticut.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.973
 Pregnancy had made Carla
a little hormonal.

03:01.047 --> 03:04.175
Dr. Kelso, I asked you to keep this
matter away from the Board.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.480
 Were you able to?
 Nurse Espinosa, I...

03:06.553 --> 03:08.521
 Were you?!
 Yes!

03:08.621 --> 03:12.785
I told them Dr. Cox was taking a leave
of absence due to problems at home.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.588
 Should anyone ask, you beat him.
 Beat him. Got it.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.130
I couldn't believe
how depressed he was.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.166
 It was so sad.
 Oh, I know.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.100
When I first heard about it,
I was like, "Whoa, no way."

03:23.169 --> 03:27.333
 You don't know what this is about.
 Sure, I do, donkeyboy up in ICU.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.374
We're talking about Dr. Cox.

03:29.442 --> 03:33.606
Oh. Well, if anyone's interested,
there's a donkeyboy in the ICU.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.977
 Baby?
 No, Turk.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.711
Now, Dr. Cox needs our help
getting through this.

03:38.785 --> 03:42.050
Jordan can watch him at morning
and at night, but she's got Jack.

03:42.121 --> 03:45.352
 She's not that emotionally available.
 I'm dead inside.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.723
We're all going
to spend time with him.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.228
I've made up a schedule.
I have the first shift.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.197
 Any questions? Meeting is adjourned.
 Oh.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.958
 Gosh!
 What?

03:56.035 --> 03:59.095
For God's sakes, Reid,
there's a donkeyboy upstairs.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:11.484 --> 04:13.042
 Damn.

04:13.119 --> 04:16.350
That boy is going to town
on that carrot.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.754
You fellas want to go to
a real donkey show?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.589
It's really very tastefully done.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.822
One of the women
who entertains the donkey

04:23.930 --> 04:25.295
used to be on a soap.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.093
Pass.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.225
Standing invitation, every Thursday.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.065
Always pass, sir.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.401
Well, I'll ask Mickhead.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.839
Turk, you know what bothers me?

04:35.908 --> 04:39.002
Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk,
we act like nothing happened.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.444
I don't know.
I kinda feel for the guy.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.607
Besides... I am way too excited.

04:43.683 --> 04:48.382
I start my orthopedic rotation today.
It is going to be awesome.

04:48.821 --> 04:51.187
Turk was psyched because
orthopedic surgeons

04:51.291 --> 04:55.057
are notoriously the most unemotional,
jockish surgeons of all.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.858
Turk was going to have
a boss he could connect with.

04:57.930 --> 05:01.764
Hey, guys, I'm Dr. Stone.
I'm your new attending.

05:01.834 --> 05:05.065
 All right, fellas. Hands in.
 Yeah.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.835
 Mm. Mmm.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.842
 Dr. Stone?

05:10.910 --> 05:12.935
Usually, when people put their hands in,

05:13.012 --> 05:16.345
someone says,
"Go get them!" or "whoo!"

05:16.416 --> 05:18.577
No. No words yet.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.346
I want you all to get comfortable

05:20.420 --> 05:23.048
with the feel of your
brother's hands on yours.

05:23.122 --> 05:26.888
As surgeons, we're constantly
opening people up and looking around.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.518
But have you ever stopped
to open yourself up

05:29.595 --> 05:31.222
and look around?

05:31.297 --> 05:33.788
 Whoa.
 Mmm.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.356
Whoo!

05:39.906 --> 05:42.136
 Hey. How's he doing?
 Hi.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.076
He's not talking and he's...
you know...

05:45.812 --> 05:47.177
What?

05:47.246 --> 05:48.736
Daddy drinks a lot.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.512
First complete sentence. Fantastic.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.519
Thanks for doing this.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.147
Hey, sunshine.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.920
You gonna at least say hello?

06:00.993 --> 06:03.325
Nothing? Listen...

06:04.397 --> 06:08.163
I know you keep blaming yourself
for this, but you just can't.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.431
When my mom died, I thought
that because I was a nurse

06:11.504 --> 06:14.268
I should have been able
to prevent it somehow.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.568
But over time...

06:15.641 --> 06:19.577
...I realized that
bad things are going to happen

06:19.645 --> 06:23.342
and beating yourself up
isn't going to help anyone.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.483
That's it, sweetie. Come here.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.750
Come here.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.865
Nurse, I need you to help me
drain some fluid.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.767
But first, we have to work
on this patient.

06:46.839 --> 06:50.400
Todd, take the scalpel
and carve this into your arm.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.309
"No nurse will ever touch your dangle."

06:54.914 --> 06:56.745
 Christopher, come on.
 Oh.

06:57.216 --> 06:58.376
You know what?

06:58.451 --> 07:00.817
You're edgy because
you're on the sidelines.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.946
 I know how that digs at you.
 Yeah.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.490
It digs at you right in here.

07:05.558 --> 07:06.991
And that's OK, you know?

07:07.059 --> 07:10.495
What would you say if you could
have that big knee reconstruction?

07:11.330 --> 07:13.628
 Awesome.
 You bet it is.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.792
 Right.
 Yeah. OK.

07:15.868 --> 07:18.029
 Finished.
 Let's just take a second here

07:18.137 --> 07:20.105
to think about what we just did.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.901
 We fixed an elbow, yeah?

07:21.974 --> 07:24.602
The last thing this man said
before he went under was

07:24.677 --> 07:28.636
how much he enjoyed
Sunday morning tennis.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.182
Right? And I just,
I think that's special.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.617
And we're special.
This was special. Thank you.

07:36.889 --> 07:40.017
He actually said,
"I think that's pretty special."

07:40.092 --> 07:41.457
Then he got all emotional.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.689
 I mean, how lame is that?
 It's pretty lame.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.363
I'm just not into all of that
sensitive touchyfeely stuff.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.095
You hug me all the time.

07:50.169 --> 07:51.636
And even that took a while.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.865
Remember the first time
you tried to hug me?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.133
Yeah!

07:56.209 --> 07:58.234
Your sports team won
the World Series!

08:03.015 --> 08:05.449
 What a game!
 A grand slam!

08:05.785 --> 08:09.346
With Dr. Stone it's different.
We're not friends.

08:09.455 --> 08:13.084
What kind of guy gets all cuddly
with people he just met? It's pathetic.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.525
Dude, that's a little harsh.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.159
How long have you been
holding that button?

08:18.231 --> 08:21.394
Long enough for me to hear
what you really think.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.793
Great.

08:23.870 --> 08:27.931
Is there another guy on this planet
who's that sensitive?

08:30.076 --> 08:31.839
 OK. Let it out.

08:31.944 --> 08:35.072
I got ya. J.D.'s got ya.

08:35.147 --> 08:38.446
Hold me tighter. Little too tight.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.009
 There's a good spot.

08:46.926 --> 08:50.589
 Elliot, why did I have to come?
 Because we're a couple, Keith.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.324
 We do things together.
 OK.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.731
Would it be OK if I moved?
This couch is... uncomfortable.

08:59.472 --> 09:03.203
Dr. Cox, I am not going to pretend
to know what you're going through,

09:03.276 --> 09:05.437
but believe me,
I've had my experiences.

09:05.511 --> 09:09.242
Remember when I put my malaria patient
through that painful procedure,

09:09.315 --> 09:11.180
when everyone knew he'd die anyway?

09:11.250 --> 09:14.117
You know what? I'm just going
to go sit in the bathroom.

09:15.588 --> 09:19.718
Know what I do when I'm having a really
tough time getting through things?

09:22.628 --> 09:24.994
I just leave the city,

09:25.097 --> 09:28.931
get into nature, and just take stock
of what's really important.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.970
Just make sure you don't go
to a popular parachute dropzone.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.438
I don't know if it was
the adrenaline rush

09:41.514 --> 09:44.779
or because I thought he was an angel,
but it's fastest I've gone

09:44.850 --> 09:48.115
from meeting to kissing.
Yeah. True story.

09:49.789 --> 09:53.555
 I'm just worried about this mole.
 Doesn't look cancerous.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.025
Ah, get in there and
take your pants off.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.954
 You gonna go talk to Dr. Stone?
 It'll blow over.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.795
Plus, he's a surgeon.
Surgeons don't hold grudges.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.199
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go scrub up.

10:04.270 --> 10:08.036
By the way, your shift with
Dr. Cox starts in ten minutes.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.006
Turk was right.
Personal feelings

10:11.077 --> 10:14.638
shouldn't get in the way of a
professional relationship, but they do.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.245
What do you say we rebuild that knee?

10:18.317 --> 10:20.877
Actually, I think
I'm going to let Dr. Norman here

10:20.987 --> 10:23.547
take the lead on this one, OK?

10:25.958 --> 10:29.052
Look, Carla, I have a real problem
with what Dr. Cox did

10:29.128 --> 10:31.494
and I don't think
I can go over there.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.760
I'm gonna send somebody else
over for you, OK?

10:37.837 --> 10:40.328
J.D. Was supposed to come but, um...

10:41.874 --> 10:43.398
...he... he's not coming.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.916
 I couldn't really worry
about bailing on Dr. Cox.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.421
The Stanleys' child was sick and
I had just spent the last 20 minutes

10:56.489 --> 11:00.323
asking them awkward questions to rule
out the possibility of child abuse.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.954
 Who would smother their own child?
 You'd be surprised.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.793
There's Munchausen Syndrome,

11:05.865 --> 11:10.029
where a parent will intentionally harm
their child to get attention themselves.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.297
I've never heard of that.

11:12.371 --> 11:15.431
Someone should do a public service
announcement about it.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.203
 Hmm. Someone should.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.205
Had a tough day at the office,
come home, make yourself some dinner,

11:22.281 --> 11:25.250
smother your kids, pop in a movie,
maybe have a drink.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.512
It's fun, right? Wrong.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.645
Don't smother your kids.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.916
That problem would be gone forever.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.395
 I am so mad at you.
 Yeah, you big jerk.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.523
How could you stand up Dr. Cox?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.761
Wait, is that what
we came to yell at him for?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.803
Well, yeah.
What did you think it was?

11:45.871 --> 11:49.034
Apparently J.D. Told Mr. Ketay
I'm throwing a birthday party.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.302
He asked where the cake was.
I panicked.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.378
I told him we got him
a weekend in Vegas.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.914
 What?
 Can I see Celine Dion?

11:55.981 --> 11:57.881
Oh, anything you want, Mr. Ketay!

11:57.950 --> 11:59.713
You're going halfsies with me.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.788
I can't believe you didn't
show up at Dr. Cox's.

12:02.855 --> 12:06.120
Do you have any idea who I
had to send in your place?

12:06.258 --> 12:08.920
# Gray skies are gonna clear up

12:08.994 --> 12:11.758
# Put on a happy face
Haphappyhap

12:11.831 --> 12:13.992
# Brush off the clouds and cheer up

12:14.100 --> 12:15.624
If you're not digging this,

12:15.701 --> 12:18.329
I've got a hundred jokes about these.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.373
# Sunshine all over the place

12:21.474 --> 12:23.237
# Just put on
Put on

12:23.309 --> 12:26.210
# A happy face #

12:26.278 --> 12:27.245
Yeah.

12:28.114 --> 12:31.447
I'm just not down with the whole
drinking and doctoring thing.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.075
 Deal with it.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.550
Excuse me.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.553
I'll never get a good
surgery on this rotation.

12:37.656 --> 12:40.819
I can help you with Dr. Stone.
He's one of my people.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.258
 He's a sensie.
 What's a sensie?

12:43.329 --> 12:45.297
It's short for sensitive guy.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.924
Our music is acoustic alternative.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.968
We marvel at fireflies.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.765
And when we help a drunk girl
home from the bar,

12:52.838 --> 12:54.601
sure, we cop a feel...

12:54.673 --> 12:56.971
...a feel of her hair
as we're pulling it back

12:57.042 --> 12:58.669
so she doesn't get vomit on it.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.871
I'm having a weird
med school flashback.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.244
I think you held my hair back
while I vomited.

13:03.315 --> 13:07.274
It was our last year. I didn't want you
to get Jägermeister in your cornrows.

13:07.386 --> 13:10.355
 My Latrell Sprewell phase.
 Hockey?

13:10.422 --> 13:11.946
 Basketball.
 Damn it.

13:12.024 --> 13:15.790
 What am I going to do about Dr. Stone?
 You're going to cry in front of him.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.661
Laugh if you must, but it'll show
you have emotional depth

13:21.734 --> 13:25.830
and it will trigger a nurturing impulse
inside him that we sensies can't resist.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.169
How the hell am I supposed to cry?

13:28.240 --> 13:30.003
You need to cry. Let's brainstorm.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.669
I could hit you
over the head with a wrench.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.908
Or... I could stab you
in the gut with a knife.

13:37.349 --> 13:39.817
# Knifewrench

13:39.885 --> 13:41.853
Practical and safe.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.178
Whoa!

13:44.757 --> 13:45.917
Ow!

13:45.991 --> 13:50.291
 Oh! Oh, boy!
 Anyhoo, don't worry about crying.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.421
I got this menthol
from the pharmacy.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.728
I read online that
actors in Hollyweird

13:54.800 --> 13:57.098
spray their eyes
when they need to fakecry.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.329
Why do you have five?

13:59.038 --> 14:02.804
I'm using it for the final death
scene in my movie, Dr. Acula.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.844
Last night, my German financier, Hans,

14:05.911 --> 14:08.038
rest in peace, died on the Autobahn.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.775
So now I got to shoot
the whole thing on my cell phone.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.010
Hello, Bob.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.648
 No cheek kiss necessary.
 Oh, good. I had pipe breath.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.421
So... when was the last time I was here?

14:22.528 --> 14:24.689
'97? I know it's been a while

14:24.797 --> 14:27.493
because Enid could still
fit through that door.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.625
I shouldn't joke,
she's very ill.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.636
I'm going to go take a shower.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.003
Oh, Perry?

14:39.411 --> 14:42.346
I don't really know why I'm here,
but Nurse Espinosa said

14:42.414 --> 14:44.780
if I didn't, she'd stop
coming over to my house

14:44.884 --> 14:47.648
and giving instructions
to my pool boy.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.245
He speaks English,
but doesn't have front teeth,

14:50.322 --> 14:52.654
so I can never look at him
without laughing.

14:55.060 --> 14:59.121
Anyway, I don't know what
she expects me to say to you.

14:59.198 --> 15:03.157
I mean, all you do
is bust my ass day in and day out.

15:04.403 --> 15:08.237
I guess you... you keep me
in line on those rare occasions

15:08.307 --> 15:11.276
when I lose sight of things.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.869
You could say we
balance each other out pretty well.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.584
Perry...

15:19.652 --> 15:22.143
...the hospital needs you.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.586
I need you.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.452
What the hell are you doing?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.285
Did Elliot leave
without telling me?

15:31.196 --> 15:33.130
Why is there an intern
in my bathroom?

15:33.198 --> 15:34.756
It's not my birthday.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.960
She made me watch.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.010
OK, there he is. You ready?

15:46.278 --> 15:47.302
Ow!

15:47.379 --> 15:50.075
He's the one that needs to cry,
you idiot. Not me.

15:50.649 --> 15:51.809
Ow!

15:51.884 --> 15:54.216
Oh yeah. I forgot all
about that crying stuff.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.516
I was just... oh hey!
Loose thread.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.078
 No!
 Got it.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.351
# Knifewrench!

16:00.426 --> 16:02.189
For kids.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.929
OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor which
means you got about seven seconds.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.728
A hug takes seven seconds?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.362
A good one does.
Here's the plan.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.531
You're going to tell him
a story that isn't inherently sad.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.974
When you get emotional,
he will think you're extrasensitive.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.012
I'll nail you with the menthol.

16:21.113 --> 16:24.344
You'll be crying like a
tenyearold Pilgrim widow.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.350
Here he comes.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.682
And... blacktion.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.917
 Dr. Stone.
 Christopher.

16:32.024 --> 16:35.118
Yeah, you know, I'm just
out here thinking about my wife.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.287
She's pregnant with our first child.

16:37.363 --> 16:40.821
 Now come on, fishy.
Take the bait.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.163
Children are pretty darn special.

16:43.235 --> 16:47.467
I have seven of my own, and each one is
just as compassionate as the next one.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.905
That is the quality
that me and my six exwives

16:49.975 --> 16:52.443
tried to instill in our children.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.806
It's overwhelming here.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.179
Exactly.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.282
You know, my new wife, Carol,

17:01.353 --> 17:02.877
she is four months pregnant.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.651
 Congratulations.
 We're separated.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.692
Uhhuh.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.661
We are not so different, you and I.

17:10.729 --> 17:13.060
 He's not a sensie.
He's a nut job.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.692
It's hug time, Chris.
Come here.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.497
 Whoa!

17:19.505 --> 17:20.938
Old habit.

17:21.673 --> 17:25.404
So he has a mild concussion and they're
going to let him rest for a while.

17:25.477 --> 17:28.138
Good. That gives us time
to come up with a new plan.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.976
Oh, no. That's it. I'm done.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.243
There's no way we will
have a relationship.

17:32.351 --> 17:35.115
Not unless I want to bear
his 17th child.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.586
He's your attending,
you have to connect.

17:37.656 --> 17:40.784
You need somebody you can look up to,
someone you can count on.

17:40.859 --> 17:43.953
What you need is someone
who will always have your back.

17:44.029 --> 17:46.327
No, J.D., that's what you need.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.764
That's what you've always needed.

17:48.867 --> 17:52.234
Maybe after five years working here,
that's not such a good thing.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.234
I got to go and do
my shift with Dr. Cox.

17:58.777 --> 18:01.007
 Right then I knew
what I had to do.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.818
 Hey.
 What's up?

18:18.130 --> 18:21.657
You're probably wondering why
I didn't show up before, huh?

18:21.733 --> 18:25.066
I know you wanted me to,
even though you'd never admit it.

18:25.537 --> 18:28.438
Normally I would kill
to get into this apartment,

18:28.507 --> 18:30.998
and you'd try and keep me out.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.340
I say "try" because,

18:33.412 --> 18:35.073
at your Super Bowl party,

18:35.147 --> 18:37.377
which I was not invited to,

18:37.449 --> 18:42.079
I was lucky enough to be able to watch
the second half from right over there.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.123
I was the bearded Domino's
employee you invited in

18:45.224 --> 18:49.160
because I said I was a fan of
Jerome Bettis, whoever the hell that is.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.030
Anyway, I tried to convince myself

18:53.098 --> 18:55.123
the reason I didn't come earlier

18:55.200 --> 18:57.691
was because of you
coming into work drunk.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.035
But that's not it.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.668
I was scared.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.444
I guess after all this time,

19:09.515 --> 19:12.746
I still think of you as, like,
this superhero

19:12.818 --> 19:16.686
that will help me out
of any situation I'm in.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.518
I needed that.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.219
But that's my problem, you know,
and I'll deal with that.

19:24.463 --> 19:27.227
I guess I came
over here to tell you...

19:29.001 --> 19:31.060
...how proud of you I am.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.833
Not because you did the best
you could for those patients...

19:36.341 --> 19:39.003
...but because after 20 years
of being a doctor...

19:40.612 --> 19:44.070
...when things go badly,
you still take it this hard.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.743
And I got to tell you, man, I mean...

19:50.322 --> 19:52.813
...that's the kind of doctor
I want to be.

19:52.891 --> 19:55.121
 Maybe he just needed
time to heal,

19:55.194 --> 19:58.652
or maybe he just needed to see
how much everybody cared,

19:58.730 --> 20:00.960
but I'd like to believe
it was because of me

20:01.033 --> 20:03.934
that he was finally able to say this...

20:04.736 --> 20:06.431
You don't drink scotch.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.042
That's awful.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.907
I'm glad you finally shaved.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.574
 That's the thing about family.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.083
If you fall off the deep end,

20:20.152 --> 20:22.985
you can always count on them
to rally around you.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.991
And when you come back,
you might get a quick hug...

20:27.059 --> 20:28.993
... a pat on the shoulder...

20:29.061 --> 20:31.529
... maybe just a nod...

20:31.830 --> 20:34.390
... but no words
really need to be spoken.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.126
Of course...

20:36.201 --> 20:38.135
... it's always nice when they are.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.693
J. D...

20:41.740 --> 20:43.298
...thank you.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.201
You're welcome.
