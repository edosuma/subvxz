01:05.199 --> 01:06.950
Corpsman!

01:11.955 --> 01:13.832
Corpsman!

01:15.501 --> 01:17.294
Corpsman!

01:25.969 --> 01:28.764
For God's sakes!
Corpsman!

01:31.975 --> 01:33.936
Corpsman!

01:46.156 --> 01:48.993
Corpsman!

01:53.331 --> 01:55.041
What's wrong?

02:10.931 --> 02:14.519
Every jackass thinks
he knows what war is.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.440
Especially those who
have never been in one.

02:19.274 --> 02:22.025
We like things nice and simple:

02:22.026 --> 02:26.072
Good and evil, heroes and villains.

02:26.281 --> 02:29.159
There's always plenty of both.

02:30.535 --> 02:34.831
Most of the time, they are not
who we think they are.

02:52.932 --> 02:54.768
Where is he?

02:56.102 --> 02:58.104
Where is he?

02:59.481 --> 03:03.067
Where, where is he?

03:05.069 --> 03:07.113
Mr. Bradley?

03:09.073 --> 03:11.117
Mr. B? You okay?

03:11.326 --> 03:13.954
- Where is he?
- Where is who?

03:14.205 --> 03:17.082
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where, where is he?

03:17.249 --> 03:19.585
All right. Just stay right here, okay?

03:19.794 --> 03:23.255
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.

03:24.799 --> 03:26.884
Where is he?

03:29.220 --> 03:33.766
Most guys I knew would never talk
about what happened over there.

03:34.099 --> 03:37.228
Probably because they're still
trying to forget about it.

03:37.436 --> 03:42.441
They certainly didn't
think of themselves as heroes.

03:44.527 --> 03:47.780
They died without glory.

03:47.988 --> 03:50.491
Nobody has taken their pictures.

03:50.699 --> 03:52.993
Only their buddies knew what they did.

03:53.244 --> 03:56.455
I'd tell their folks they died
for their country.

03:57.581 --> 03:59.375
I'm not sure that was it.

03:59.583 --> 04:02.127
Now, there were
plenty other photos taken that day...

04:02.169 --> 04:04.505
...but none anybody wanted to see.

04:04.713 --> 04:08.175
What we see and do in war...

04:08.384 --> 04:12.555
...the cruelty, is unbelievable.

04:13.138 --> 04:16.058
But somehow we gotta make
some sense of it.

04:16.141 --> 04:19.644
To do that, we need
an easy-to-understand truth...

04:19.853 --> 04:22.147
...and damn few words.

04:24.191 --> 04:25.818
Film's ruined.

04:26.026 --> 04:29.864
I don't know. This one looks all right.

04:33.659 --> 04:36.204
And if you can get a picture...

04:39.165 --> 04:44.546
Now, the right picture can win
or lose a war.

04:44.754 --> 04:47.340
You're gonna want to see this.

04:48.174 --> 04:49.301
Look at Vietnam.

04:49.509 --> 04:51.761
The picture of that
South Vietnamese officer...

04:51.970 --> 04:55.348
...blowing that fella's brains
out of the side of his head.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.685
That was it.

04:59.185 --> 05:01.187
The war was lost.

05:02.188 --> 05:05.191
We just hung around
trying to pretend it wasn't.

05:07.193 --> 05:11.781
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.

05:14.284 --> 05:16.620
Thanks. Appreciate it.

05:27.005 --> 05:29.633
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.

05:30.675 --> 05:32.010
Country was bankrupt.

05:32.218 --> 05:36.681
People were becoming cynical
and tired of war.

05:50.236 --> 05:53.239
- Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
- Where?

05:53.281 --> 05:57.243
Right there. Planting that flag,
that's your brother.

05:57.410 --> 05:59.621
Ma, all you can see is his behind.

05:59.829 --> 06:03.793
And that's his. I powdered
and diapered it, I know my son.

06:04.001 --> 06:06.545
That's him. Go get your father.

06:06.754 --> 06:09.840
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's
keister in the paper.

06:10.049 --> 06:13.010
You watch your mouth, young man.

06:26.691 --> 06:28.275
Thank you.

06:30.611 --> 06:35.533
One photo, almost all on its own,
turned that around.

06:35.741 --> 06:38.452
It's on the front page
of every major paper.

06:38.703 --> 06:43.165
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded
with requests for prints.

06:44.542 --> 06:47.378
I think we might have found it.

07:37.345 --> 07:39.681
Corpsman!

07:39.890 --> 07:41.516
Corpsman!

07:45.479 --> 07:46.897
Corpsman!

07:47.105 --> 07:48.857
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.

07:49.066 --> 07:50.357
Iggy, I gotta go.

07:50.358 --> 07:54.446
I have a whole different theory. He wants
medical attention, he'll come to us.

07:54.654 --> 07:58.408
Hey, shut up and crawl over here,
you lazy son of a bitch!

07:58.617 --> 08:00.410
- As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.

08:00.619 --> 08:02.537
- Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.

08:02.788 --> 08:05.373
- You're gonna leave me here?
- I'll be right back, just-

08:05.540 --> 08:07.918
Shoot some people. I gotta go.

08:20.388 --> 08:21.973
Oh, God.

08:22.474 --> 08:23.725
Okay, it's okay.

08:24.392 --> 08:25.560
Don't touch them.

08:25.852 --> 08:28.395
Get your hands out, let me do that.
Don't look.

08:28.396 --> 08:30.315
Keep your head back, your eyes on me.

08:30.398 --> 08:33.777
Look at me. I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.

08:33.985 --> 08:36.988
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.

08:37.197 --> 08:39.698
And we'll get you down
to the bottom, all right?

08:39.908 --> 08:42.702
You're gonna be fine.

08:42.910 --> 08:44.704
It's okay.

08:44.913 --> 08:47.207
I'll do that. I'll do that.

08:47.541 --> 08:50.878
Put some pressure on that. Put your
hands on top and put pressure on it.

08:51.087 --> 08:52.964
Keep your head back. Keep breathing.

08:53.172 --> 08:56.342
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at-

09:01.430 --> 09:02.849
Doc.

09:04.433 --> 09:06.894
Help me.

09:09.438 --> 09:12.441
Help me.

09:35.339 --> 09:37.133
How does that feel?

09:38.217 --> 09:40.468
- It feels good.
- It does? All right.

09:40.469 --> 09:43.139
- Good.
- All right.

09:43.347 --> 09:45.850
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
I'll be right back.

09:46.058 --> 09:48.060
I'm all right.

09:48.269 --> 09:50.479
Go and help someone who's hurt.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.066
All right. Hold on there.

10:05.912 --> 10:07.622
- Where did he go?
- Who?

10:07.830 --> 10:11.292
- The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
- You jumped in the wrong hole.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.505
I didn't jump in the wrong hole! He
was right here, now where the hell is he?

10:16.506 --> 10:18.508
Iggy!

10:19.509 --> 10:20.552
Iggy!

10:20.761 --> 10:22.971
Shut up. You want every Jap
shooting at us?

10:23.180 --> 10:24.932
Iggy!

10:44.701 --> 10:47.287
Holy shit.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.540
They expect us to climb this?

10:54.544 --> 10:56.713
Or something just like it.

11:03.553 --> 11:06.056
So where you think they're sending us?

11:06.807 --> 11:09.434
I think it's the desert, Franklin.

11:09.810 --> 11:11.561
Well, that makes no sense at all.

11:11.728 --> 11:13.563
Well, it's just military psychology.

11:13.605 --> 11:17.150
They always train you for the desert
on a volcano.

11:18.694 --> 11:21.863
Now you're just having fun with me.

11:22.072 --> 11:25.450
Harlon, take your men right.
Watch for Bedouins.

11:25.575 --> 11:28.912
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.

11:29.705 --> 11:33.750
Well, jeez Louise,
maybe we are going to the desert.

11:34.001 --> 11:39.173
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what
if the bullet comes from the left?

11:39.382 --> 11:43.970
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?

11:44.178 --> 11:46.931
That makes as much sense
as you showering with your shoes on.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.267
You don't even know
why you do it, do you?

11:49.475 --> 11:51.602
Because I don't tell you
mean I don't know?

11:51.644 --> 11:54.063
You do it because Mike does it.

11:54.605 --> 11:56.399
I'll ask him.

11:56.733 --> 11:59.777
- So you cut hair back home?
- Some.

12:00.028 --> 12:02.196
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?

12:02.405 --> 12:05.366
No, I just studied it a little.

12:06.117 --> 12:09.746
- But not in barber school?
- Nope.

12:11.914 --> 12:13.624
Let me guess, Hayes is winning.

12:13.791 --> 12:16.627
Chief, I had very little to do
with Sitting Bull's death...

12:16.794 --> 12:18.963
...so maybe you could stop
taking it out on me.

12:19.672 --> 12:23.634
Different tribe. The Pimas fought
on the side of the white man.

12:23.801 --> 12:25.678
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.

12:25.887 --> 12:29.307
Yeah. Worked real good for us.

12:29.515 --> 12:30.892
Good luck, fellas.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.894
Hey, good night, Lindberg.

12:33.102 --> 12:37.065
Dead bodies. He cuts hair
on dead bodies.

12:38.316 --> 12:39.817
Even I knew that.

12:41.736 --> 12:44.655
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.

12:44.906 --> 12:48.368
It must be a lot easier with them
not moving around and all.

12:48.576 --> 12:50.119
There's that.

12:50.828 --> 12:52.455
You know what I been thinking?

12:52.663 --> 12:55.375
Well, they been telling us
we need to buddy up...

12:55.583 --> 12:58.002
...and I think we'd make
pretty good buddies.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.670
And how do you figure that?

12:59.712 --> 13:03.592
Well, you know, in that we
have a lot in common.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.929
So why do you cut dead people's
hair, anyway?

13:07.137 --> 13:09.681
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.

13:11.809 --> 13:14.228
You tell a lot of people that?

13:14.436 --> 13:17.689
You actually chose the Marines
because they got the best uniform?

13:18.357 --> 13:22.277
No sense being a hero
if you don't look like one.

13:24.446 --> 13:26.115
Jacks.

13:26.949 --> 13:28.283
Queens.

13:28.784 --> 13:30.702
Shit.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.997
Do anything on that reservation
but play cards, chief?

13:34.206 --> 13:37.751
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch
of leathernecks!

13:39.128 --> 13:42.589
We going over the side tomorrow
which means we ain't long for this rock.

13:42.714 --> 13:44.091
- All right!
- About time.

13:44.299 --> 13:47.094
Any man who doesn't
have his masturbation papers in order...

13:47.302 --> 13:49.680
...get them signed by tomorrow
or he ain't going.

13:49.721 --> 13:52.099
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah. I'm square.

13:52.307 --> 13:54.435
Wait. Why am I just hearing about this?

13:54.685 --> 13:56.770
I don't have to repeat everything
twice for you.

13:56.979 --> 14:00.315
No, I didn't hear nothing
about no masturbating papers.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.526
Heard they were running short.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.655
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.

14:06.738 --> 14:11.034
All right, get over to the officer in charge
of records. Maybe he's got more.

14:11.743 --> 14:14.204
- Leave your smokes. I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.

14:14.413 --> 14:17.124
Listen, he calls you an idiot,
you take it like a man, okay?

14:17.332 --> 14:19.334
Just do not leave without signing them.

14:19.543 --> 14:21.753
- I appreciate it, sergeant.
- You got it.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.097
What the hell happened
to your hair, Rene?

14:31.848 --> 14:33.308
Look like a goddamn corpse.

14:38.563 --> 14:41.858
Three points of contact on that rope
at all times.

14:42.066 --> 14:45.570
Next four. Over the side.

14:45.778 --> 14:48.031
Let's go. Keep moving.

14:48.239 --> 14:50.074
Next four, over the side.

14:50.283 --> 14:53.536
Keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.

14:53.745 --> 14:55.787
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.

14:55.788 --> 14:59.209
Keep three points of contact
on the rope at all times.

15:01.544 --> 15:04.464
You see? No big thing.

15:04.672 --> 15:07.967
Just one step at a time and keep
your hands on the vertical rope.

15:08.218 --> 15:09.802
Once you're in the boat, move away.

15:09.928 --> 15:12.597
Make sure you keep three points
of contact on the rope.

15:13.932 --> 15:16.518
- I got him!
- All right, get that man out of the water.

15:16.726 --> 15:18.311
Give me a hand.

15:19.938 --> 15:23.399
- Don't worry about him, Doc.
- All right, quit skylarking! Keep moving.

15:23.608 --> 15:25.985
He'll be fine.

15:26.236 --> 15:28.738
Our target, Island X...

15:28.821 --> 15:33.576
...is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab
of rock called Iwo Jima.

15:33.826 --> 15:36.829
It means Sulfur Island,
which accounts for the smell.

15:38.373 --> 15:40.833
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop,
you ask me.

15:42.293 --> 15:45.547
After 20 straight days of bombing
you won't find a blade of grass...

15:45.755 --> 15:48.841
...or a twig on it. It wasn't that pretty
to start with.

15:49.175 --> 15:50.219
Captain?

15:50.427 --> 15:53.597
Iwo's just five and a half miles long,
two and a half wide.

15:54.014 --> 15:57.226
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.645
On the maps in front of you
the island is white.

15:59.853 --> 16:00.854
Not much of it.

16:01.772 --> 16:04.608
The black dots represent
known enemy emplacements.

16:04.817 --> 16:08.654
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-
purpose guns, covered artillery.

16:08.862 --> 16:10.864
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns...

16:11.031 --> 16:14.660
...machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes,
and earth-covered structures.

16:14.868 --> 16:17.371
I don't see any barracks
or any other structures.

16:17.830 --> 16:19.039
That's right.

16:19.290 --> 16:20.833
And we still don't know why.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.877
Now, this isn't just any island to them.

16:23.961 --> 16:28.465
This isn't Tarawa, Guam,
Tinian, or Saipan.

16:28.674 --> 16:31.885
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.

16:32.303 --> 16:34.888
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders
in eight square miles.

16:35.055 --> 16:37.474
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.

16:37.683 --> 16:39.184
It's up to us to convince them.

16:40.311 --> 16:42.771
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.

16:43.063 --> 16:46.025
The 8th Ammo Company
will land here to resupply.

16:46.233 --> 16:49.902
The Suribachi's guns are the problem.
They can hit any point on the island.

16:49.903 --> 16:53.490
We're sitting ducks until
we take them out. That's our job.

16:54.074 --> 16:57.911
We cut across the island at the base,
slit its throat, lop off its head.

16:57.995 --> 17:02.499
And we take that mountain. We take
that mountain, we take their big guns.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.710
We take their eyes.

17:17.807 --> 17:20.226
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.

17:20.644 --> 17:22.479
Let's put a good show on
for the Marines.

17:22.686 --> 17:24.689
Close it up. Take it right down
to the deck.

17:39.871 --> 17:42.082
Yeah, boys!

17:45.251 --> 17:48.380
Man overboard portside!

17:56.680 --> 17:58.014
See him?

18:00.433 --> 18:02.977
- Throw me a line!
- He's right there.

18:03.561 --> 18:06.147
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.

18:06.439 --> 18:08.566
Hawaii's that way!

18:11.695 --> 18:15.573
Just keep paddling, Mac,
we'll catch you on the way back!

18:16.241 --> 18:18.743
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!

18:20.036 --> 18:21.579
They're not gonna stop.

18:21.788 --> 18:23.164
What?

18:23.415 --> 18:27.001
None of them are. They can't.

18:33.049 --> 18:36.010
So much for "no man left behind."

18:42.977 --> 18:44.937
- Sir.
- Come on in.

18:45.020 --> 18:48.566
Look, I've had to make a few
other changes. I'm promoting you...

18:48.774 --> 18:50.693
...to platoon sergeant.

18:51.569 --> 18:54.613
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You bet.

18:54.822 --> 18:57.825
Trouble is, I already told my men
I'd see them through this.

18:58.117 --> 19:02.204
That your James Cagney impersonation?
Because I've heard better.

19:02.830 --> 19:04.582
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.

19:06.041 --> 19:09.086
This isn't your first time.
You don't need to prove anything.

19:09.295 --> 19:10.796
No, sir.

19:12.631 --> 19:16.051
You're not the best sergeant, you're just
the best one that's still walking.

19:16.218 --> 19:18.053
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.

19:18.095 --> 19:20.639
The men know him, he can step right in.

19:22.933 --> 19:25.144
You know, I have actually
thought this through.

19:25.352 --> 19:28.063
Platoon sergeant puts you further away
from the bullets.

19:28.230 --> 19:31.025
I already gave them my word, sir.

19:31.066 --> 19:32.943
I told them I'd bring them all home.

19:33.068 --> 19:36.197
Which means I already lied
to half of them. Can't lie to the rest.

19:39.742 --> 19:40.826
How are your men?

19:41.035 --> 19:42.828
They'll do fine.

19:43.245 --> 19:44.663
Except maybe Gagnon.

19:45.498 --> 19:47.875
Our own Tyrone Power?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.085
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just...

19:50.211 --> 19:53.088
...might be better use further back
from the lines.

19:55.090 --> 19:57.092
I'll use him as a runner.

19:58.052 --> 19:59.678
All right. Thank you, sir.

19:59.970 --> 20:01.514
Now get out of here.

20:08.271 --> 20:11.107
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.

20:11.274 --> 20:14.694
Hey, you do that again
I'll take your head off!

20:14.903 --> 20:16.112
Fucking dominoes.

20:16.905 --> 20:20.700
Iggy, have you ever heard news
you considered to be bad?

20:21.368 --> 20:23.203
The first ones off the ship, Doc.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.789
We don't go over the side of the ship.

20:25.997 --> 20:28.208
We hop on a tractor,
they drive us right there.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.794
Oh, shit, that is good news.

20:31.002 --> 20:33.463
You see? What did I tell you?

20:40.136 --> 20:42.097
What's going on?

20:44.391 --> 20:46.560
- I'm going up to take a look.
- Let's go.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.436
Let's go topside. Come on!

20:48.645 --> 20:50.313
- I'll go with you.
- Come on, come on!

20:50.564 --> 20:51.857
What the hell?

20:52.941 --> 20:54.734
- Let's go, let's go!
- Right behind you.

21:07.747 --> 21:09.583
Look at that.

21:10.166 --> 21:13.336
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.

21:39.614 --> 21:42.199
I was promised 10 days of shelling.

21:42.241 --> 21:45.369
You're giving me three and saying
that's the best you can do?

21:45.620 --> 21:48.706
I don't give a shit! My men hit that beach
with less than 10...

21:48.915 --> 21:51.584
...and I'll be taking them home
to their mamas in buckets!

21:54.337 --> 21:56.005
Yeah, I know exactly why.

21:56.213 --> 21:58.966
Because every Navy man
with a scrambled egg on his chest...

21:59.175 --> 22:01.802
...wants to offload us here
and sail to Japan...

22:02.011 --> 22:04.972
...so they can be there for the big finish.

22:05.181 --> 22:08.225
Tell their kids they captured the emperor
all by themselves.

22:08.392 --> 22:12.897
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless
we take this piece-of-shit island!

22:13.105 --> 22:16.025
These little pricks are dug in!

22:18.235 --> 22:23.908
Okay. Appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.

22:28.996 --> 22:31.248
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

22:31.832 --> 22:33.292
I'm okay.

22:34.251 --> 22:38.673
- Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
- Jesus, Iggy, leave me alone, all right?

22:39.131 --> 22:43.177
How about you guys? Knife? Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?

22:43.260 --> 22:46.597
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?

22:46.806 --> 22:48.641
You sharpened it three times already.

22:48.849 --> 22:51.520
Then I better make sure I didn't nick it.

22:53.271 --> 22:55.065
Good man, Doc.

22:59.069 --> 23:01.279
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.

23:02.447 --> 23:06.159
When we land, try not to wave
this kit around too much.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.328
They got sharpshooters trained
to look for them.

23:08.537 --> 23:10.372
They know if they
take out a corpsman...

23:10.580 --> 23:13.041
...another dozen Marines will die
unattended.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.043
Okay, Mike.

23:21.299 --> 23:22.759
Yeah, right there.

23:53.749 --> 23:57.335
- Close the damn door. For God's sake.
- Yeah, like that's gonna help.

24:04.342 --> 24:06.094
That your girlfriend, chief?

24:08.346 --> 24:10.682
Bet she's a pretty damn
good-looking squaw.

24:10.891 --> 24:14.352
Bet you're missing her,
and that little wigwam of yours.

24:23.946 --> 24:27.658
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.368
We have a long-time wait-

24:29.494 --> 24:31.537
It's what they do to prisoners...

24:35.083 --> 24:37.168
...at least the lucky ones.

24:37.376 --> 24:38.795
Jesus.

24:39.045 --> 24:44.133
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think
about waving a white bandanna.

24:44.342 --> 24:48.638
Poor Marines, so far from home
for no good reason.

24:49.680 --> 24:53.351
Think of your girls back home,
waiting for you.

24:53.392 --> 24:56.437
But a girl cannot stay home
every night...

24:56.646 --> 25:00.316
...so who do you think
they're with tonight?

25:00.399 --> 25:05.905
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?

25:06.114 --> 25:10.535
This sweet music is to make you
think of your girls back home...

25:10.743 --> 25:12.161
...who are missing you.

25:12.453 --> 25:16.415
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.585
We're clear!

28:07.755 --> 28:08.881
Get up the berm!

28:12.176 --> 28:13.594
Baker Company, move out!

28:13.636 --> 28:15.595
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.

28:15.596 --> 28:18.308
- First squad, move out!
- God, this place reeks.

28:32.614 --> 28:34.616
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!

28:34.700 --> 28:40.622
Go, go, go! Go, go! Go!
Go, go! Drop your packs! Go!

28:41.415 --> 28:42.541
All clear!

28:46.170 --> 28:47.629
Jesus, you needed some exercise?

28:47.755 --> 28:51.383
He got lost. 100 landing craft heading
for one beach and this guy gets lost.

28:51.592 --> 28:53.635
I'm glad we did. Jesus, what a mess.

28:53.802 --> 28:56.513
Any theories why they ain't shooting?

28:57.431 --> 28:59.641
It's getting on my nerves.

28:59.683 --> 29:01.727
Maybe they're all dead.

29:02.353 --> 29:03.645
What do you think, Doc?

29:03.729 --> 29:07.066
- You think they're all dead?
- Keep moving, Easy Company! Let's go!

29:28.670 --> 29:31.673
Mike, take six men and bring that gun
onto the beach.

29:31.799 --> 29:35.177
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down. Come on.

29:35.677 --> 29:37.221
Move! Move!

30:15.135 --> 30:16.886
- Get down!
- Take cover!

30:18.304 --> 30:19.889
Move out!

30:27.981 --> 30:31.317
Go, go! Get up on the beach!
Get up on the berm!

30:36.448 --> 30:37.490
Go, go, go!

30:43.538 --> 30:45.498
Cover fire! Pour it on!

30:48.334 --> 30:51.504
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!

31:00.763 --> 31:02.807
Corpsman!

31:04.017 --> 31:07.520
I'm gonna sling your arm and then
I'll give you a shot for the pain.

31:08.563 --> 31:12.775
Move, move! Off the beach!
Take cover!

31:17.656 --> 31:19.325
Dig in! Dig in!

31:19.909 --> 31:22.786
First Platoon! Move, move!

31:29.793 --> 31:31.587
You got a girl back home, Marine?

31:31.795 --> 31:33.881
We're gonna make sure
she sees you, all right?

31:34.089 --> 31:36.967
Hey, I need pressure on this wound!

31:38.719 --> 31:43.265
- See anything?
- Negative! Pull that fire team up!

31:43.974 --> 31:45.851
Where's the fire coming from?

31:56.820 --> 31:58.531
Where are they?

31:59.156 --> 32:01.158
Look for a flash, shoot at it!

32:02.409 --> 32:04.245
Let's go, let's-

32:12.586 --> 32:15.589
- Move it out!
- Move, move! Let's go!

32:21.845 --> 32:24.098
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!

32:25.266 --> 32:27.268
You're over!

32:36.860 --> 32:39.280
Third Squad, forward! Move!

32:50.792 --> 32:52.752
Where are they, sir?

32:52.877 --> 32:55.797
We got ten o'clock! Ten o'clock,
pillbox! Sergeant!

32:57.799 --> 32:59.884
Sergeant. I think I can clear that out.

32:59.926 --> 33:01.469
All right, you go. Here.

33:01.928 --> 33:04.639
Take these. Check your weapon.

33:04.889 --> 33:08.476
Yeah? Go! Cover!
Cover him!

33:14.232 --> 33:16.234
Cover, cover!

33:20.905 --> 33:22.324
Son of a bitch.

33:27.912 --> 33:30.457
- Let's go! Go!
- Move it out!

33:33.918 --> 33:35.920
Go, go, go!

33:38.882 --> 33:41.092
Down, down, down!

33:59.194 --> 34:01.488
- It's clear.
- Good work.

34:09.996 --> 34:13.376
- I thought you said it was clear!
- It was!

34:19.130 --> 34:22.677
Shit, I guess they're not in there
firing at us then.

34:23.761 --> 34:25.096
Lindberg!

34:25.304 --> 34:26.472
Yeah!

34:26.681 --> 34:27.973
Light it up!

34:30.976 --> 34:33.978
- I'll cover you, Ice!
- Don't cover shit!

34:34.146 --> 34:36.148
There's already enough people shooting.

34:36.399 --> 34:39.150
One bullet and this thing goes up
like a Roman candle.

34:39.402 --> 34:41.654
Go! Shift fire!

34:41.862 --> 34:43.572
- Shift your fire!
- Go, go!

34:45.991 --> 34:48.661
Shift your fire!

34:52.748 --> 34:55.000
Go! Go!

35:22.737 --> 35:25.030
Hit the deck! Stay down!
Wait for support!

35:26.699 --> 35:28.617
Is this a bad battle or what?

35:28.826 --> 35:31.037
- It's a fucking slaughter.
- Get down!

35:35.292 --> 35:37.043
Corpsman!

35:42.007 --> 35:44.384
Christ Jesus!

35:50.640 --> 35:53.602
Get a machine gun team
set up over here now!

35:53.852 --> 35:55.937
Corpsman! Corpsman!

35:58.273 --> 36:01.151
Thank God! Tanks! Runner!

36:01.359 --> 36:03.987
Get those tanks up here!

36:05.071 --> 36:08.241
- Oh, shit.
- Man. Get down!

36:08.492 --> 36:11.077
Corporal, watch your left flank!

36:11.203 --> 36:13.038
- Let's go without them!
- Let's go!

36:13.079 --> 36:14.498
- Move out! Move out!
- Let's go!

36:15.499 --> 36:17.209
Let's go, move it. Let's go!

36:41.274 --> 36:43.902
Iggy, you gotta lift your side,
he's gonna roll off.

36:44.110 --> 36:45.695
Got it, Doc!

36:48.532 --> 36:50.116
Incoming!

36:50.575 --> 36:52.118
Corpsman!

36:55.706 --> 37:00.086
- Move, move, move!
- Everybody off the LVT, now!

37:00.127 --> 37:02.129
Give them cover fire!

37:09.595 --> 37:11.138
Corpsman!

37:25.736 --> 37:27.113
Keep moving!

37:27.154 --> 37:29.949
Get that LVT up on the beach!

37:31.325 --> 37:33.160
Keep moving!

37:38.916 --> 37:42.295
You're next, pal,
we're getting you out of here.

37:45.590 --> 37:47.341
Move it!

38:01.689 --> 38:03.357
Great news.

38:04.358 --> 38:07.987
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa,
because that's where we're headed.

38:09.906 --> 38:11.197
Not you and me.

38:11.198 --> 38:15.369
Captain Severance asked who else was in
that picture. Christ if I could remember...

38:15.620 --> 38:18.582
...but it was Mike and Doc and
Franklin and me and Hank Hansen...

38:18.790 --> 38:21.752
...but I just remembered,
you were there too.

38:26.548 --> 38:28.008
I wasn't there.

38:28.216 --> 38:29.801
Of course you were.

38:30.010 --> 38:33.764
Neither was Hank. He raised the first flag.
Harlon Block raised that one.

38:34.014 --> 38:37.184
Shit. I told them it was Hank.

38:38.018 --> 38:40.604
If you weren't there,
how'd you know it was Harlon?

38:40.812 --> 38:43.273
- You tell them it was me?
- No. I just remembered.

38:43.482 --> 38:45.108
Good, keep your mouth shut.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.362
They know there was
somebody else, by the picture.

38:48.570 --> 38:51.156
- Pick someone dead.
- They don't want somebody dead...

38:51.239 --> 38:54.201
...they want to ship us back
to the States.

38:54.242 --> 38:56.244
What did I tell you?

38:58.330 --> 39:01.500
- I wasn't there. You hear?
- All right.

39:02.292 --> 39:04.920
Just settle down.

39:05.337 --> 39:08.757
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.

39:55.763 --> 39:57.765
You wounded, son?

39:57.974 --> 39:59.307
No, sir.

39:59.308 --> 40:02.478
Did you take out a nest of Japs
butt-naked with your bare hands?

40:02.729 --> 40:04.480
Because if I'm gonna
give up my seat...

40:04.731 --> 40:07.400
...to a hero, he better have
a good goddamn story to tell.

40:07.775 --> 40:09.068
No, sir.

40:09.360 --> 40:13.573
Then enjoy it, because they'll forget you
before Christmas.

40:38.514 --> 40:41.267
Sixth man, you got a name?

40:41.350 --> 40:43.352
Sorry, still don't remember.

40:43.519 --> 40:47.315
Damn shame, because I promised
the major you'd know who it was.

40:47.356 --> 40:51.694
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on
you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.

40:51.903 --> 40:54.697
Since no one wants to be embarrassed,
the moment you land...

40:54.906 --> 40:59.368
...they'll turn around, ship you to Okinawa
to meet your buddies on the beach.

40:59.452 --> 41:01.370
So why don't you stop
screwing with me?

41:01.496 --> 41:03.331
Give me a damn name.

41:21.183 --> 41:23.560
Gangway!
Gangway! Let's go, let's go! Gangway!

41:23.811 --> 41:27.356
Where the hell is that son of a bitch?
Hayes! Hayes!

41:27.815 --> 41:30.567
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Looks like I don't know...

41:30.818 --> 41:33.946
...what my men are doing with a flag
the size of my mother's house?

41:34.154 --> 41:38.158
Damn it, you shouldn't have lied to me.
Made me look like a complete asshole.

41:38.367 --> 41:41.370
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.

41:47.835 --> 41:50.921
Now your name's in the paper too.

41:54.424 --> 41:57.427
Just heard your doctor
say we're postponing your operation.

41:57.511 --> 41:59.471
You're being shipped back
to the mainland.

41:59.680 --> 42:03.725
Everybody who saw that picture
thought planting the flag meant victory.

42:04.518 --> 42:08.147
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.

42:08.438 --> 42:12.526
Within a few weeks of that picture
being taken, half the men in it were dead.

42:12.734 --> 42:16.446
Mrs. Hansen. Mrs. Hansen.
Did you know Hank was a hero?

42:16.613 --> 42:19.032
- Are you proud of him?
- What was he like as a boy?

42:19.241 --> 42:22.953
- Look this way, please, ma'am.
- What do you have to say about your son?

42:23.871 --> 42:27.040
But, somehow,
being a part of it meant something.

42:27.624 --> 42:33.464
Looking at it, you could believe
their sacrifice was not a waste.

42:36.926 --> 42:39.637
Yeah, I might have thought
that was Harlon too.

42:39.888 --> 42:41.514
It is.

42:42.473 --> 42:44.767
Belle, their names are right here.

42:44.976 --> 42:46.769
It's not him.

42:46.978 --> 42:52.275
And he would be alive
and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.

42:52.483 --> 42:56.571
You think about that
when you look at his picture, Ed.

44:03.472 --> 44:07.351
And I need to rush home and change
because there's the governor's banquet...

44:07.559 --> 44:09.520
...and then there's the parade.

44:09.561 --> 44:13.107
Imagine, the governor
is coming here to meet us.

44:13.315 --> 44:15.150
Now, I'm wearing blue so-

44:15.359 --> 44:19.321
We interrupt this program to bring you a
news bulletin from CBS World News.

44:19.571 --> 44:22.866
A press association has just announced
that President Roosevelt is dead.

44:23.075 --> 44:25.577
The president died
of a cerebral hemorrhage.

44:25.619 --> 44:30.541
All we know so far is that the president
died at Warm Springs in Georgia.

44:31.583 --> 44:33.585
Further updates every hour.

44:33.711 --> 44:35.963
Temperatures will remain
the same today...

44:36.171 --> 44:38.966
...in the mid-30s to low-40s
with clear skies.

44:39.174 --> 44:40.634
Hello?

44:41.010 --> 44:43.762
Yes. Of course.

44:44.013 --> 44:48.183
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.

44:49.310 --> 44:50.602
Thank you.

44:54.356 --> 44:57.401
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.

44:57.609 --> 45:01.196
Senator Haddigan, I'd like you to meet
Private First Class Ira Hayes.

45:01.405 --> 45:03.198
Damn good to meet you.

45:03.407 --> 45:05.701
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.

45:10.497 --> 45:11.623
Sorry?

45:13.792 --> 45:16.628
That's Pima Indian talk,
don't you know your own language?

45:16.712 --> 45:18.881
Took forever to memorize
the damn gibberish.

45:19.089 --> 45:22.594
Sorry, I've been away
from the reservation too long, senator.

45:28.433 --> 45:29.768
- Doc.
- Ira.

45:29.976 --> 45:32.771
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!

45:32.979 --> 45:36.441
- That's you.
- Go, go, go.

45:36.649 --> 45:38.651
Please welcome...

46:10.934 --> 46:12.685
Yeah. Yeah.

46:21.986 --> 46:25.198
Holy shit.

46:25.407 --> 46:28.284
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.

46:28.493 --> 46:30.203
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.

46:30.412 --> 46:33.123
- Showing the boys the sights?
- Saw a hell of a ball game.

46:33.373 --> 46:35.458
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.

46:35.667 --> 46:39.087
I got some briefing sheets for you,
some simple things we want you to say.

46:39.295 --> 46:42.715
Mostly "Buy bonds."
Can't say that too often.

46:42.757 --> 46:47.430
Itineraries, those'll change every minute.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.766
I got women sending up envelopes
with stockings in them...

46:50.975 --> 46:52.435
...notes written in lipstick.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.228
We won't mention that to the press.

46:54.437 --> 46:56.729
Have a drink, for chrissake.

46:56.730 --> 46:59.316
My God, what you boys
must've seen over there.

46:59.525 --> 47:03.821
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.

47:04.738 --> 47:06.115
So...

47:06.323 --> 47:08.993
...we got a hell of a lot of money
to raise, not much time.

47:09.201 --> 47:11.203
White House tomorrow,
then you shake hands...

47:11.412 --> 47:14.081
...with a few hundred congressmen
who won't pull out a penny.

47:14.290 --> 47:15.666
Politicians and actors.

47:15.749 --> 47:18.751
Put them in a restaurant,
they'd die before paying the check.

47:18.752 --> 47:21.505
Then New York City, Times Square...

47:21.714 --> 47:24.467
...dinners with various hoi polloi,
then Chicago.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.427
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?

47:26.635 --> 47:29.763
That's what we're calling the mothers
of the dead flag-raisers.

47:29.930 --> 47:32.892
You present each mother with a flag,
they say a few words...

47:33.100 --> 47:35.769
...people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.

47:36.061 --> 47:38.355
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.

47:38.772 --> 47:41.567
Lovely woman. She knows how close
you and her son were.

47:41.775 --> 47:45.488
He wrote home about you. She is very
much looking forward to meeting you.

47:45.696 --> 47:48.491
Hank wasn't in the picture.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.075
Sorry?

47:50.784 --> 47:53.454
Hank didn't raise that flag.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.581
He raised the other one, the real flag.

47:55.789 --> 47:58.792
The what? The real flag?
There's a real flag?

47:58.959 --> 48:02.963
Ours was the replacement flag. We put
it up when they took the other one down.

48:03.214 --> 48:06.300
Am I the only one getting
a headache here? You know about this?

48:06.509 --> 48:10.597
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, Bud.

48:10.805 --> 48:12.849
That's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.

48:13.058 --> 48:16.853
Why tell me? I'm only the guy that
has to explain it to 150 million Americans.

48:17.062 --> 48:20.814
Who's in the goddamn picture? Are any
of you guys in the goddamn picture?

48:20.815 --> 48:22.817
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.

48:22.859 --> 48:25.820
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.

48:25.987 --> 48:28.323
- You're three of them?
- This was the fifth day.

48:28.532 --> 48:30.408
The battle went on for 35 more.

48:30.617 --> 48:33.828
What'd you do, raise a damn flag
every time you stopped for lunch?

48:33.995 --> 48:35.830
Can I hit this guy?

48:35.872 --> 48:40.585
I don't give a shit, you raised the flag,
that's the story we're selling, boys.

48:40.794 --> 48:44.130
Are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.

48:44.381 --> 48:45.840
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?

48:46.007 --> 48:50.762
Harlon Block. That's whose mother
should be here if anyone's should be.

48:50.845 --> 48:54.933
You know, I think this whole damn thing
is a farce, if you ask me.

49:14.035 --> 49:17.205
You know what they're calling
this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.

49:17.414 --> 49:21.001
They might've called it the "We're Flat
Broke so We're Begging for Pennies"...

49:21.209 --> 49:24.878
...bond drive, but it didn't have
the ring. They could've called it that...

49:24.879 --> 49:28.425
...because the last bond drives came
so short we printed money instead.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.635
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street...

49:30.844 --> 49:33.888
...our dollar is next to worthless,
we borrowed so much.

49:33.889 --> 49:36.809
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.

49:36.892 --> 49:40.479
Tanks aren't being built. Machine guns,
bazookas, hand grenades, zip.

49:40.688 --> 49:43.816
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?

49:43.899 --> 49:45.901
Stuff some rocks in your pockets...

49:45.943 --> 49:48.613
...because that's all we got
to throw at the Japanese.

49:48.821 --> 49:51.365
And don't be surprised
if your plane doesn't make it...

49:51.574 --> 49:53.200
...because the fuel dumps are empty.

49:53.409 --> 49:56.078
And our good friends the Arabs
are only taking bullion.

49:56.329 --> 50:00.583
If we don't raise 14 billion dollars-
And that's million with a "B."

50:00.791 --> 50:02.835
- This war is over
by the end of the month.

50:02.918 --> 50:05.671
We give the Japanese
whatever they want and we come home.

50:05.880 --> 50:08.924
You've seen them fight,
and they sure as shit ain't giving up.

50:09.008 --> 50:13.929
Fourteen billion. The last three drives
didn't make that much altogether.

50:16.515 --> 50:21.062
People on the street corners, they looked
at this picture and they took hope.

50:21.270 --> 50:25.358
Don't ask me why, I think it's crappy,
myself. You can't even see your faces.

50:25.941 --> 50:29.737
But it said, "We can win this war,
are winning this war...

50:29.945 --> 50:31.947
...we just need you to
dig a little deeper."

50:31.989 --> 50:35.951
They wanna give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.

50:36.202 --> 50:38.953
But you don't want to ask for it,
give them hope.

50:38.954 --> 50:42.750
You want to explain
about this person and that flag.

50:42.958 --> 50:45.544
Well, that's your choice.

50:45.753 --> 50:49.340
Because if we admit we made a mistake,
that's all anybody'll talk about...

50:49.548 --> 50:51.759
...and that will be that.

51:01.103 --> 51:02.688
Gentlemen.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.982
Mr. President, here they are.

51:06.108 --> 51:09.027
- Well, hello. Good to see you.
- Mr. President.

51:09.236 --> 51:10.946
Darn good to see you, boys.

51:10.987 --> 51:14.783
Heard you had a hell of a fight
on your hands out there, hell of a fight.

51:14.991 --> 51:18.370
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation
in Arizona, am I right?

51:18.578 --> 51:20.455
Yes, Mr. President.

51:20.664 --> 51:24.000
Being an Indian,
you are a truer American than any of us.

51:24.584 --> 51:27.002
Bet your people are proud
you're in that uniform.

51:27.003 --> 51:28.338
Very proud, sir.

51:29.005 --> 51:31.675
They should be.
Thank you for coming all this way...

51:31.883 --> 51:35.512
...to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific...

51:35.721 --> 51:38.515
...now we need you to fight
for a mountain of cash.

51:38.724 --> 51:40.809
- I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.

51:41.017 --> 51:43.186
- No, sir.
- Good. Then go get it.

51:43.437 --> 51:45.605
That's the end of this ceremony.

51:45.814 --> 51:49.317
Let's take a look at this famous photo
over here, see if I can pick you out.

51:50.110 --> 51:53.447
My gosh. There you are.

52:01.621 --> 52:04.958
Boys. Boys, this one's on me.

52:05.041 --> 52:08.295
- To those who can't be with us.
- Yes, sir.

52:10.630 --> 52:14.843
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?

52:15.719 --> 52:17.846
I suppose.

52:18.638 --> 52:20.098
And your name is?

52:21.058 --> 52:24.145
I get the impression I'm drinking
with the wrong heroes.

52:24.353 --> 52:28.649
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.

52:28.858 --> 52:30.318
That's just not true.

52:33.654 --> 52:37.533
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.

52:47.126 --> 52:50.087
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?

52:50.129 --> 52:53.633
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands. John Tennack.

52:53.841 --> 52:55.384
John Bradley.

52:55.593 --> 52:58.095
These boys, Harvard and Yale types,
didn't fight.

52:58.179 --> 53:02.600
Pappies all rich sons of bitches. Boys,
shake hands with some real war heroes.

53:02.809 --> 53:04.894
Excuse me for one moment.

53:05.102 --> 53:06.896
Buy them a drink while you're at it.

53:07.104 --> 53:09.398
Drinks for these men all the way around.

53:09.607 --> 53:12.109
And you're the other one,
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.

53:12.276 --> 53:15.238
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you. Have a drink.

53:15.446 --> 53:19.075
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene.

53:19.116 --> 53:21.911
When you get finished being famous,
you come see me...

53:22.119 --> 53:24.831
...because if you can sell bonds,
you can sell homes.

53:25.039 --> 53:28.209
Now, they're not gonna build homes
anymore, they're gonna deliver them.

53:28.417 --> 53:30.086
- Heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.

53:30.127 --> 53:34.006
You will. And you hang on to that card
and you come see me, you hear?

53:34.131 --> 53:35.299
- All right?
- Certainly will.

53:35.550 --> 53:36.884
All right.

53:43.808 --> 53:45.143
It's all right.

53:53.193 --> 53:56.154
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?

53:57.155 --> 54:00.325
If Mike and the guys could see us.

54:01.159 --> 54:03.662
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it,
would they?

54:06.164 --> 54:07.833
Harlon!

54:10.752 --> 54:13.046
Franklin!

54:15.757 --> 54:18.594
Can you imagine Franklin...

54:19.595 --> 54:22.264
...on this train...

54:22.472 --> 54:27.185
...eating at the dining car
with all the silver?

54:32.065 --> 54:34.192
We shouldn't be here, Doc.

55:31.334 --> 55:34.921
Ira! Hey, Ira.
We heard the picture was posed.

55:35.129 --> 55:38.257
- What?
- We heard you posed the picture!

55:38.383 --> 55:40.259
Hey, Doc.

55:47.809 --> 55:50.228
We're bigger than life, Doc.

56:17.880 --> 56:20.842
- Hey, good job.
- Thank you.

56:29.308 --> 56:33.313
Thank you, girls. And now...

56:33.355 --> 56:36.567
...here are the men
you've been waiting to meet...

56:36.775 --> 56:38.610
...the men in white.

56:38.861 --> 56:42.865
Right behind me, here,
the heroes of Iwo Jima:

56:43.073 --> 56:46.326
Private First Class Rene Gagnon...

56:46.410 --> 56:48.704
...Private First Class Ira Hayes...

56:48.912 --> 56:53.333
...and Navy Corpsman
John "Doc" Bradley!

57:04.636 --> 57:06.138
Thank you.

57:10.350 --> 57:13.896
It's good of you to come out tonight
in support of the war effort.

57:14.104 --> 57:16.523
We really need you to buy bonds,
that's for sure.

57:16.774 --> 57:19.318
Because we can't win the war
without your help.

57:19.359 --> 57:23.363
As far as us
being the heroes of Iwo Jima...

57:24.156 --> 57:26.325
...that's just not the case.

57:26.366 --> 57:28.285
We really didn't do much at all.

57:28.368 --> 57:30.287
Especially him.

57:30.829 --> 57:33.040
Especially me.

57:33.248 --> 57:36.168
I was just a runner. That's it.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.378
We put up a flag.

57:38.796 --> 57:42.382
The pole we attached it to was heavy,
so it took a number of us.

57:42.716 --> 57:45.260
We had our picture taken doing it.

57:46.136 --> 57:50.265
The real heroes are dead on that island.

57:50.390 --> 57:54.394
We'd appreciate it if you bought bonds
in honor of them. Thank you.

58:11.287 --> 58:13.873
Jump on any grenades, Ira?

58:14.082 --> 58:17.001
Take out any machine gun nests
I missed?

58:17.585 --> 58:21.089
- At least I fired my weapon.
- All right, knock it off.

58:21.297 --> 58:23.591
You hit anything
or were you too drunk then too?

58:23.842 --> 58:27.220
Hey, hey, hey. Guys! Come on.

58:27.428 --> 58:30.348
Stop it. Knock it off.

59:08.261 --> 59:11.264
Sit between these two boys.

59:21.482 --> 59:24.445
- For us and they need our help.

59:24.486 --> 59:28.574
And if you think about it,
I think you'll realize...

59:28.782 --> 59:33.579
...that buying more bonds
is not just the right thing to do...

59:33.787 --> 59:35.664
...but the only thing to do.

59:37.458 --> 59:41.462
Yes, this war has gone on too long.

59:41.503 --> 59:45.549
We have given too many lives.
And its cost-

59:45.758 --> 59:47.760
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.

59:47.968 --> 59:52.097
- Has been far too high.
But if we waver now...

59:52.348 --> 59:57.311
...if we don't dig deep
and give more than we think we can...

59:57.519 --> 01:00:00.439
...then those sacrifices
would be wasted...

01:00:00.522 --> 01:00:04.985
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.

01:01:43.168 --> 01:01:46.629
Move! Go, go!

01:01:55.889 --> 01:01:57.307
Corpsman!

01:02:08.151 --> 01:02:11.113
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?

01:02:11.322 --> 01:02:13.657
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says go without them.

01:02:13.783 --> 01:02:15.451
Christ.

01:02:15.659 --> 01:02:17.745
Real good work you're doing there,
Rene.

01:02:19.914 --> 01:02:21.999
Prepare to move out. Pass the word.

01:02:22.208 --> 01:02:24.251
- Prepare to move out!
- Second Platoon!

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.046
- Move! Move!
- All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!

01:02:27.296 --> 01:02:29.673
- Let's move out!
- Jackass.

01:02:29.757 --> 01:02:32.385
- Let's move out!
- Go, go, go!

01:02:32.593 --> 01:02:36.013
Move, go, go, move, move!

01:02:52.113 --> 01:02:53.280
Corpsman!

01:03:02.873 --> 01:03:04.667
Doc!

01:03:05.709 --> 01:03:07.711
Doc, get out of there!

01:03:15.719 --> 01:03:18.180
Corpsman!

01:03:18.389 --> 01:03:20.266
Doc!

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:29.900
Doc, get the hell out of there!

01:03:37.367 --> 01:03:38.910
May I have your attention, please?

01:03:39.161 --> 01:03:43.747
Train number 48,
with service from New York City...

01:03:43.748 --> 01:03:47.043
...Boston, Rochester, New York...

01:03:47.252 --> 01:03:50.755
...Toledo, Ohio, South Bend, Indiana...

01:03:50.797 --> 01:03:53.758
...is now arriving on Track 7.

01:03:54.176 --> 01:03:57.095
Train number 48,
now arriving on Track number 7.

01:03:57.304 --> 01:04:00.015
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

01:04:02.934 --> 01:04:04.769
- Come on, let's go.
- Boys.

01:04:05.353 --> 01:04:07.939
- Watch your step, now.
- Thank you very much.

01:04:08.773 --> 01:04:10.317
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:04:10.567 --> 01:04:12.777
- Watch your step.
- Let me help you, ma'am.

01:04:28.585 --> 01:04:32.756
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.

01:04:34.925 --> 01:04:38.303
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.

01:04:39.846 --> 01:04:43.391
- Private First Class Ira Hayes.
- Excuse me, let me through, please.

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:47.562
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.

01:04:47.771 --> 01:04:50.815
Rene! That's my boyfriend!

01:04:52.275 --> 01:04:55.153
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

01:04:55.362 --> 01:04:57.948
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?

01:04:58.824 --> 01:05:00.368
Hey, look at that!

01:05:02.537 --> 01:05:04.622
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.832
Hey, she's a beauty.

01:05:13.172 --> 01:05:15.091
Let's go find a saloon.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.604
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.

01:05:29.855 --> 01:05:33.025
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?

01:05:34.986 --> 01:05:36.612
Where exactly are you staying?

01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:38.864
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:42.910
- Who's the dreamboat?
- Hey, Rene, a big smile.

01:05:45.871 --> 01:05:47.290
Come on, one more shot.

01:05:51.836 --> 01:05:54.213
Senator, I'd like you to meet
Corpsman John Bradley.

01:05:54.422 --> 01:05:55.798
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:55.881 --> 01:05:58.883
Good to meet you. Now, we
appreciate everything you've done...

01:05:58.884 --> 01:06:01.887
...and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.

01:06:02.054 --> 01:06:04.223
This is Captain White.

01:06:04.432 --> 01:06:06.601
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, corpsman.

01:06:06.809 --> 01:06:08.060
And then Colonel McCourtney.

01:06:08.311 --> 01:06:10.605
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.

01:06:13.899 --> 01:06:16.068
Senator,
this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.

01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:17.653
Of course.

01:06:17.862 --> 01:06:20.948
Now, I hear you used a tomahawk
on those Japs, is that true, chief?

01:06:21.157 --> 01:06:22.908
No, sir.

01:06:22.992 --> 01:06:26.371
Well, tell them you did.
Makes a better story, huh?

01:06:27.706 --> 01:06:29.875
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.

01:06:31.627 --> 01:06:33.003
John?

01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:36.089
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.008
I'm Hank's mom.

01:06:38.634 --> 01:06:42.220
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.

01:06:42.429 --> 01:06:45.932
- This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
- Pleasure to meet you, son.

01:06:46.099 --> 01:06:47.934
- Thank you, sir.
- Thanks for everything.

01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:49.811
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.

01:06:49.936 --> 01:06:54.232
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank,
Mike's mom.

01:07:08.288 --> 01:07:10.123
It's all right.

01:07:10.707 --> 01:07:13.543
When I got the telegram, I...

01:07:14.544 --> 01:07:17.130
I don't know
what I'm trying to say here.

01:07:18.965 --> 01:07:24.012
Knowing he was with you that day
and seeing him in that photograph...

01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:27.391
...I don't know why it makes me
feel better, but it does.

01:07:27.974 --> 01:07:30.936
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

01:07:31.645 --> 01:07:33.980
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.

01:07:35.273 --> 01:07:38.235
We're the largest
furniture wholesaler in Illinois.

01:07:38.443 --> 01:07:42.072
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.991
- Well, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:07:45.158 --> 01:07:46.743
Are you Rene?

01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:49.580
Yes, ma'am.

01:07:53.418 --> 01:07:55.795
I'm Franklin's mother.

01:07:59.048 --> 01:08:01.050
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.

01:08:03.261 --> 01:08:06.472
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.

01:08:07.807 --> 01:08:09.475
Would you mind?

01:08:17.358 --> 01:08:20.027
Paper said that's Hank...

01:08:20.153 --> 01:08:22.154
...and I honestly can't tell.

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:26.783
It's horrible of a mother
not to know her own son, isn't it?

01:08:26.993 --> 01:08:28.786
But that's him, isn't it?

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:33.416
Well, to be honest, ma'am,
it happened so quick...

01:08:33.624 --> 01:08:37.837
...and with everything that was going on
it's hard to remember who was where.

01:08:39.756 --> 01:08:41.048
But...

01:08:43.176 --> 01:08:45.428
...yeah, I think that's where he was.

01:08:45.636 --> 01:08:47.180
That's Hank.

01:08:47.388 --> 01:08:49.055
Thank you.

01:08:49.223 --> 01:08:51.225
Excuse me.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.062
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:08:59.066 --> 01:09:00.734
Excuse us.

01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:18.086
Take him outside.

01:09:19.505 --> 01:09:22.674
I'm Pauline. Nice to meet you.

01:09:25.385 --> 01:09:28.514
He was the best Marine I ever knew.

01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:31.099
Thank you.

01:09:41.193 --> 01:09:43.529
- You okay, chief?
- Christ.

01:09:43.904 --> 01:09:46.198
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, you look it.

01:09:46.406 --> 01:09:48.283
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:51.118
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.

01:09:52.287 --> 01:09:53.580
I've got him.

01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:55.916
Get some sleep, Ira.

01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:23.212
- Mike?
- Yeah?

01:11:24.005 --> 01:11:25.381
- Do you see this?
- What?

01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:27.508
- Mike?
- Oh, shit, go!

01:11:34.098 --> 01:11:35.642
He's killing me!

01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:17.434
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?

01:12:17.977 --> 01:12:21.270
- What?
- Well, they're not shooting at us.

01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:23.857
Maybe we killed them all
or they ran off in the night.

01:12:24.066 --> 01:12:26.068
Or they're waiting for us
to start climbing.

01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:28.862
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.

01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:30.864
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.

01:12:31.073 --> 01:12:33.617
All right, Third Platoon, move!

01:12:33.826 --> 01:12:35.285
I tag along?

01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:38.622
You can lead the way, if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.

01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:41.041
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous,
Hank.

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:43.419
Hey, that'll work for me too.

01:12:45.879 --> 01:12:50.551
Lieutenant,
if you make it to the top, put this up.

01:12:50.759 --> 01:12:52.344
Yes, sir.

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:01.228
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.

01:13:01.311 --> 01:13:03.312
- They don't?
- No.

01:13:03.313 --> 01:13:05.649
They want us to go up,
signal that it's okay...

01:13:05.858 --> 01:13:08.485
...then shoot everybody else
as they come up the mountain.

01:13:08.736 --> 01:13:10.320
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:14.324
Unless, of course, they want to make an
example of us and discourage the others.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:16.869
I think you're full of crap,
you know that, Hank?

01:13:17.077 --> 01:13:18.328
Really?

01:13:19.079 --> 01:13:21.206
Jesus.

01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:24.502
Thank God that ain't us.

01:13:36.473 --> 01:13:38.349
Told you.

01:13:40.101 --> 01:13:42.479
Boots, spread them out
and put them on a line.

01:13:42.687 --> 01:13:45.940
Set up a perimeter! First Squad!

01:13:51.154 --> 01:13:53.364
- Hank? Find me a pole.
- Yeah.

01:13:54.407 --> 01:13:55.450
Right here.

01:13:56.785 --> 01:13:59.245
Let's put this flag up.

01:14:05.293 --> 01:14:06.461
Watch it.

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.255
Right over here.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.638
Here, here. That's good.
Right here, right here.

01:14:16.846 --> 01:14:19.557
Got that end? Hold that steady.

01:14:20.266 --> 01:14:21.935
Lindberg.

01:14:23.937 --> 01:14:26.564
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.

01:14:30.151 --> 01:14:32.987
- Give me something- Yeah, good.
- That work?

01:14:38.076 --> 01:14:39.953
Do it, fellas.

01:14:41.412 --> 01:14:43.581
Keep it coming.

01:14:49.421 --> 01:14:52.758
USMC! USMC!

01:14:53.843 --> 01:14:55.010
- Shit, look!
- Look at that!

01:14:58.013 --> 01:15:00.099
Yeah!

01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:13.946
Yeah! Yeah!

01:15:29.461 --> 01:15:31.589
Jeez, look at that.

01:15:39.013 --> 01:15:41.056
Get down! Take cover!

01:15:41.974 --> 01:15:43.225
Cover with that. 30!

01:15:43.434 --> 01:15:47.229
- Watch it! Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?

01:15:47.438 --> 01:15:51.483
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!

01:15:52.276 --> 01:15:55.486
Boots, you see them?
Cover right!

01:15:55.487 --> 01:15:58.073
- About 20 yards down! Duck one!
- You see them?

01:15:58.282 --> 01:15:59.617
Keep the cover on!

01:16:00.492 --> 01:16:04.288
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!

01:16:05.206 --> 01:16:06.999
I see them!

01:16:17.761 --> 01:16:20.805
- You see them?
- Right flank, over to the right!

01:16:24.517 --> 01:16:26.518
Cover me, I'm going down!

01:16:26.519 --> 01:16:29.105
Careful, Iggy. Easy.

01:16:30.273 --> 01:16:32.442
All clear!

01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:44.663
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?

01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:47.666
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:16:47.874 --> 01:16:50.542
- Goddamn it. Strank!
- Sir?

01:16:50.543 --> 01:16:53.296
They want a phone line run up
to the top of the mountain.

01:16:53.505 --> 01:16:55.006
Let me guess, they picked us.

01:16:55.215 --> 01:16:59.094
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.

01:17:03.682 --> 01:17:07.227
Let's go. Get off your ass.

01:17:10.563 --> 01:17:12.524
Oh, shit!

01:17:12.565 --> 01:17:16.236
Hope it still works,
because you're not getting mine.

01:17:16.444 --> 01:17:18.989
- Get Forrestal!
- All right.

01:17:22.492 --> 01:17:24.744
I don't know whose idea it was,
Mr. Secretary.

01:17:24.995 --> 01:17:27.622
Well, it was goddamned brilliant.

01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:29.749
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words...

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.505
...raising that son of a bitch means
a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.

01:17:35.588 --> 01:17:37.842
I want that flag.

01:17:38.384 --> 01:17:43.389
Yes, sir. I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.

01:17:44.265 --> 01:17:47.560
Fuck that. That flag belongs
to the men in this battalion.

01:17:47.601 --> 01:17:50.521
That son of a bitch thinks
our men died taking this ground...

01:17:50.604 --> 01:17:53.607
...so we could hand our flag
to some politician to pin to his wall?

01:17:53.774 --> 01:17:56.110
He's out of his goddamn mind!

01:17:56.694 --> 01:17:59.280
Get me that flag
and find another one to replace it.

01:17:59.488 --> 01:18:02.658
You've gotta be shitting me. Gagnon!

01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:06.912
Get your ass over here.

01:18:11.625 --> 01:18:12.626
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:15.212
- Hey, fellas.
- How you doing?

01:18:17.798 --> 01:18:19.508
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.

01:18:21.052 --> 01:18:23.429
It's that kind of day.

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:46.660
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, lieutenant.

01:18:47.953 --> 01:18:49.663
Lieutenant!

01:18:55.419 --> 01:18:57.797
Captain says he wants that flag.

01:18:58.672 --> 01:19:01.593
- He wants this flag?
- Yes, sir.

01:19:02.677 --> 01:19:05.680
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:05.847 --> 01:19:07.349
Some kind of flag shortage?

01:19:07.974 --> 01:19:09.810
He wants you to put this one up instead.

01:19:16.983 --> 01:19:18.693
Hey, Mike.

01:19:20.028 --> 01:19:23.657
- Do me a favor. Put this up, will you?
- Yes, sir.

01:19:23.698 --> 01:19:25.826
All right, let's find a pole.

01:19:27.869 --> 01:19:32.707
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.

01:19:34.292 --> 01:19:35.710
You heard him, let's do it.

01:19:38.797 --> 01:19:41.800
- There you go.
- Lordy, she's a heavy one.

01:19:46.638 --> 01:19:49.724
All right, hang on. Put this on.

01:19:55.147 --> 01:19:56.189
One hell of a view.

01:19:56.398 --> 01:19:59.443
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.

01:20:08.618 --> 01:20:09.870
All right.

01:20:13.707 --> 01:20:16.334
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

01:20:16.751 --> 01:20:19.254
Hey, Doc,
you wanna give us a hand here?

01:20:23.258 --> 01:20:25.761
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:26.929
Ready? Ready?

01:20:27.346 --> 01:20:28.473
Let's go.

01:20:31.767 --> 01:20:33.561
Did you get it?

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:40.568
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.

01:20:41.944 --> 01:20:45.448
Nobody even noticed
that second flag going up.

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:51.913
Everybody saw that damn picture
and made up their own story about it.

01:20:52.121 --> 01:20:57.585
But your dad and the others knew what
they had done and what they had not.

01:20:59.212 --> 01:21:01.672
All your friends dying...

01:21:01.797 --> 01:21:05.801
...it's hard enough to be called a hero
for saving somebody's life.

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:09.096
But for putting up a pole?

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:14.894
You gotta be kidding.

01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:20.191
Hey! It took a lot of talented folks
a long time to make that thing.

01:21:20.399 --> 01:21:24.320
Wait till tonight, when it's lit properly,
there's thousands of cheering people.

01:21:24.529 --> 01:21:25.821
It's gonna look a lot better.

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:29.200
So stadium lights come down,
spotlight comes up, you get your cue.

01:21:29.408 --> 01:21:31.953
Charge up this thing with the flag,
plant it at the top.

01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:34.580
You smile, you wave. You know the drill.

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:37.833
You want us to plant the flag on
a pile of papier-maché.

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:40.835
Hey, that's show biz.

01:21:40.836 --> 01:21:43.838
And try and stand how you stood
the first time you planted it.

01:21:43.839 --> 01:21:46.384
You know, pretend
the other three guys are with you.

01:21:46.592 --> 01:21:47.843
The dead guys.

01:21:49.345 --> 01:21:51.265
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:52.891 --> 01:21:56.144
- Okay, not a problem.
- Good.

01:21:56.853 --> 01:21:58.855
But where do we imagine
Hank is standing?

01:21:59.856 --> 01:22:00.857
Sorry?

01:22:01.275 --> 01:22:05.404
Seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind
of hard for us to leave a space for him.

01:22:06.029 --> 01:22:10.409
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:14.871
This is bullshit.

01:22:16.373 --> 01:22:19.668
I planted that damn thing once
and I'm not doing it again.

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.922
- Hayes.
- For chrissake.

01:22:24.131 --> 01:22:28.051
Hayes. Hayes, get your ass back here
or you're going on report.

01:22:28.302 --> 01:22:30.053
Hayes!

01:22:30.887 --> 01:22:33.473
You wanna do your damn job?

01:22:37.894 --> 01:22:40.897
Let go of me! Let go of me!

01:22:41.023 --> 01:22:45.027
Come on! Come on!

01:22:46.069 --> 01:22:50.073
He's with me! Hey, he's with me!

01:22:50.991 --> 01:22:53.702
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me, okay? He's with me.

01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:55.370
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!

01:22:55.579 --> 01:22:58.290
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!

01:22:58.498 --> 01:23:01.501
Tell them drop their sticks!

01:23:01.752 --> 01:23:03.920
They're cops.
They're supposed to have nightsticks.

01:23:04.087 --> 01:23:06.298
You're not supposed to be
swinging a chair.

01:23:06.506 --> 01:23:08.634
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.

01:23:08.884 --> 01:23:11.303
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.

01:23:11.511 --> 01:23:13.805
- That's him?
- Yes, sir. Do you read the papers?

01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:15.099
Oh, Christ.

01:23:15.933 --> 01:23:18.227
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.

01:23:18.436 --> 01:23:20.104
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:25.443
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.

01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:34.744
Did you start this?

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:36.954
He didn't serve me!

01:23:37.497 --> 01:23:39.874
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.

01:23:46.297 --> 01:23:48.257
He needs to go sleep it off.

01:23:58.476 --> 01:24:00.478
Soldier Field.

01:24:04.982 --> 01:24:06.567
You hear that?

01:24:06.776 --> 01:24:08.361
What the hell is that?

01:24:08.569 --> 01:24:10.738
I can't figure it out.

01:24:10.947 --> 01:24:12.281
Keep an eye out.

01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:15.284
Hey, it sounds like
it's coming from up there.

01:25:24.188 --> 01:25:26.482
They're using grenades.

01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:29.026
They're killing themselves.

01:25:37.785 --> 01:25:42.080
Ira, let's go. Come on.

01:25:45.501 --> 01:25:48.253
Let's go, Ira. Come on.

01:26:09.275 --> 01:26:13.112
Thank God. Jesus. Look at you, chief.

01:26:15.532 --> 01:26:17.242
You found him.

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:20.411
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:23.373
Vandegrift is here with
enough brass to start a fucking band.

01:26:23.581 --> 01:26:26.626
- Come on, let's go. Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:26.835 --> 01:26:30.004
By yourself? All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him.

01:26:30.129 --> 01:26:33.716
Get him to the top, plant that flag,
and don't fucking fall off.

01:26:33.925 --> 01:26:38.805
Get him in his stuff. I'll stall these guys
for as long as I can. Hurry up.

01:26:39.264 --> 01:26:40.306
Jesus Christ.

01:26:40.557 --> 01:26:46.145
And now the heroes of Iwo Jima!

01:26:49.816 --> 01:26:50.942
Cover!

01:26:54.863 --> 01:26:56.155
Harlon!

01:26:59.492 --> 01:27:02.495
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!

01:27:02.704 --> 01:27:04.539
O'Hare!

01:27:04.747 --> 01:27:05.915
First Fire Team!

01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:09.085
Work around!

01:27:09.168 --> 01:27:11.546
B.A.R., you, other side of the ridge!

01:27:16.342 --> 01:27:18.177
Covering fire, boys. Go, go, go!

01:27:18.344 --> 01:27:21.180
Jackson, work your team around
to the left!

01:27:21.264 --> 01:27:23.141
Cover!

01:27:32.192 --> 01:27:33.485
Left flank! Left flank!

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:41.994
Franklin, Gus, go check it out!

01:27:44.663 --> 01:27:46.790
Hustle up, boys!

01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:55.215
- We got them!
- Clear!

01:28:11.023 --> 01:28:13.400
One hell of an experience.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.034
Move out!

01:28:27.831 --> 01:28:32.336
Cease fire! They're my men!
You're targeting our men!

01:28:36.048 --> 01:28:38.175
You're targeting our-

01:28:39.134 --> 01:28:41.679
Get me another radio!

01:28:45.432 --> 01:28:47.643
Sergeant? Sergeant!

01:28:47.851 --> 01:28:52.273
Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike!

01:28:53.858 --> 01:28:56.778
Mike? Mike!

01:29:01.783 --> 01:29:03.368
Here.

01:29:03.576 --> 01:29:05.578
Hey, where's Doc?

01:29:06.287 --> 01:29:08.832
Corpsman!

01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:12.252
Oh, shit.

01:29:14.295 --> 01:29:16.756
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.

01:29:17.465 --> 01:29:20.301
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?

01:29:21.469 --> 01:29:25.098
It's okay. It's okay.

01:29:26.725 --> 01:29:28.727
Come on, Mike.

01:29:29.644 --> 01:29:32.313
Mike? Mike, can you hear us?

01:29:41.364 --> 01:29:42.657
Oh, Jesus.

01:29:44.242 --> 01:29:45.493
All right, let's go!

01:29:46.327 --> 01:29:48.038
Move out!

01:29:48.329 --> 01:29:49.914
We need a hand over here.

01:29:50.123 --> 01:29:51.332
I'm gonna get a stretcher.

01:29:51.499 --> 01:29:53.918
Let's take him down,
move him off the beach.

01:30:06.389 --> 01:30:11.144
Ladies and gentlemen,
the heroes of Iwo Jima!

01:30:12.312 --> 01:30:14.355
Corpsman!

01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:25.159
Hank! Hank!

01:30:43.385 --> 01:30:47.389
Doc, they killed me.

01:30:54.438 --> 01:30:56.398
Harlon!

01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.902
Doc...

01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:03.656
...they killed me.

01:31:04.573 --> 01:31:07.576
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.

01:31:19.213 --> 01:31:20.422
Franklin!

01:31:24.844 --> 01:31:27.888
- Franklin.
- I'm fine, Ira.

01:32:14.477 --> 01:32:16.897
Corpsman!

01:32:19.566 --> 01:32:21.483
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

01:32:21.484 --> 01:32:24.196
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?

01:32:24.404 --> 01:32:26.615
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't.

01:32:26.907 --> 01:32:29.409
He was right here.
Now, where the hell is he?

01:32:30.202 --> 01:32:33.455
Iggy! Iggy!

01:32:33.496 --> 01:32:36.498
Shut up. You want every Jap
on the island shooting at us?

01:32:36.499 --> 01:32:38.418
Iggy!

01:32:52.224 --> 01:32:53.516
Does it open?

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:56.937
Iggy!

01:32:57.812 --> 01:32:59.522
Iggy!

01:33:01.066 --> 01:33:03.318
Iggy, are you down there?

01:33:04.528 --> 01:33:06.530
Iggy!

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:10.701
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:13.496
I had to go outside to throw up.

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:17.541
Look what they did
to the poor son of a bitch.

01:34:31.908 --> 01:34:33.035
You okay, chief?

01:34:33.869 --> 01:34:35.620
Just let it go.

01:34:35.746 --> 01:34:39.291
If that doesn't pry open their wallets,
nothing will.

01:34:47.424 --> 01:34:50.635
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.

01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:56.641
Goddamn Indians.

01:35:06.735 --> 01:35:09.446
Come on, chief. Let's get you home.

01:35:18.663 --> 01:35:22.250
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.

01:35:22.459 --> 01:35:26.254
He's been drunk since he started this
damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.

01:35:26.463 --> 01:35:29.424
Just about choked that poor woman
at the reception, blubbering.

01:35:29.633 --> 01:35:32.052
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be
watching these men.

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:35.680
- Yes, sir.
- He's making us look like regular asses.

01:35:35.847 --> 01:35:38.767
With all due respect,
he never wanted to come on this trip.

01:35:38.975 --> 01:35:43.021
Had to pull him, kicking, screaming, off
that boat. He wants to be with his unit.

01:35:43.647 --> 01:35:46.233
What unit? They're all fucking dead.

01:35:46.817 --> 01:35:50.070
This is how he honors those men,
by drinking and throwing up and...?

01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:53.199
You know what? He wants it?
Great, we'll send him back.

01:35:53.408 --> 01:35:57.245
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.

01:35:58.704 --> 01:36:00.206
Yes, sir.

01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:08.714
I'll do it.

01:36:27.859 --> 01:36:32.155
Yeah, no, that's, that's good.
That's what I want.

01:36:33.906 --> 01:36:35.741
I know it's a good thing...

01:36:36.409 --> 01:36:40.538
...raising the money and that,
because we need it.

01:36:42.206 --> 01:36:47.170
But I can't take them calling me a hero.

01:36:48.754 --> 01:36:52.341
All I did was try not to get shot.

01:36:57.054 --> 01:37:02.310
Some of the things I saw done,
things I did...

01:37:03.769 --> 01:37:06.939
...they weren't things to be proud of,
you know?

01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:18.744
Mike.

01:37:22.706 --> 01:37:25.751
Mike was a hero.

01:37:27.836 --> 01:37:29.796
You ever meet him?

01:37:31.798 --> 01:37:32.966
No.

01:37:38.972 --> 01:37:41.808
Best Marine I ever met.

01:37:45.812 --> 01:37:50.943
You know, chief, I think
if Mike was sitting here instead of you...

01:37:51.151 --> 01:37:53.403
...he'd be saying the same thing
about himself...

01:37:55.822 --> 01:37:57.699
...not being a hero.

01:38:04.873 --> 01:38:06.542
Maybe.

01:38:07.834 --> 01:38:11.755
He was a good guy.

01:38:11.838 --> 01:38:16.134
But I think that he would
be ashamed of me...

01:38:16.343 --> 01:38:18.804
...seeing me the way I am.

01:38:37.864 --> 01:38:42.870
Think I could see my ma
before they ship me off?

01:38:42.912 --> 01:38:46.249
Think they'd do that? See my ma?

01:38:50.878 --> 01:38:52.213
I'm sorry, Ira.

01:39:04.225 --> 01:39:07.562
We got stories now to tell our kids,
I guess.

01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:09.772
Keep your head down.

01:39:19.032 --> 01:39:20.074
All aboard.

01:39:20.325 --> 01:39:22.493
Good luck, chief.

01:39:54.025 --> 01:39:56.444
Think I saw him once after that.

01:39:56.653 --> 01:39:59.614
It was maybe six or seven years
after the war.

01:39:59.822 --> 01:40:02.700
I was working as a salesman,
doing a lot of driving.

01:40:02.909 --> 01:40:04.452
I was driving west across Texas.

01:40:04.661 --> 01:40:07.247
I was trying to get where
I was going so I could get home.

01:40:07.956 --> 01:40:10.626
And I saw this guy hitchhiking
on the side of the road.

01:40:10.834 --> 01:40:14.088
And for a second,
I thought it might've been him.

01:40:18.717 --> 01:40:21.970
I'll always regret that I didn't stop,
but I was in a hurry.

01:40:22.971 --> 01:40:24.973
And he was an Indian.

01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:29.978
We always told the press Ira insisted that
he was going back to fight with his unit...

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:32.773
...which was at least partially true...

01:40:32.981 --> 01:40:37.986
...but that isn't what got the headlines.

01:40:38.904 --> 01:40:40.989
We're engaged.

01:40:44.952 --> 01:40:46.537
Excuse me a minute, darling.

01:40:46.745 --> 01:40:48.872
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?

01:40:48.997 --> 01:40:50.332
Got a minute?

01:40:50.541 --> 01:40:53.001
- Yeah.
- I'll see you at the car.

01:40:54.336 --> 01:40:58.006
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene. That's great.

01:40:59.466 --> 01:41:04.179
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.

01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:07.391
She's not used to all this,
but she's a good girl.

01:41:07.641 --> 01:41:09.977
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

01:41:10.018 --> 01:41:12.813
So I was wondering if
you'd be my best man.

01:41:13.021 --> 01:41:14.815
Me?

01:41:16.024 --> 01:41:21.029
Don't you have somebody at home,
a buddy you'd rather ask?

01:41:21.196 --> 01:41:23.365
Well, I didn't really make many.

01:41:23.574 --> 01:41:27.161
The ones who didn't go, it's,
well, it's hard to even talk to them.

01:41:28.036 --> 01:41:31.040
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.

01:41:33.918 --> 01:41:35.837
I'd be proud to.

01:41:36.337 --> 01:41:38.047
Thank you.

01:41:39.007 --> 01:41:41.049
I better go drag her away from them...

01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:45.013
...before she announces I'm gonna be
president of General Motors or something.

01:41:46.055 --> 01:41:47.557
All right.

01:41:47.766 --> 01:41:50.602
- Congratulations, honey.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:52.312
Rene, you're a lucky man.

01:41:55.064 --> 01:41:56.649
- Here they are now.
- Here they come.

01:41:56.858 --> 01:41:58.777
Grab a shot of them on the steps.

01:42:02.238 --> 01:42:05.825
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese.

01:42:06.034 --> 01:42:08.661
I couldn't complain,
because the press loved them...

01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:12.540
...so they wrote more articles
and people bought more bonds.

01:42:15.084 --> 01:42:19.589
The tour went on with just
Rene and your dad.

01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:25.094
And the true heroes are the men...

01:42:25.261 --> 01:42:27.639
...who didn't make it home
from Iwo Jima...

01:42:27.847 --> 01:42:31.976
...the men who died at Iwo Jima
and in other campaigns.

01:42:32.101 --> 01:42:34.896
We ask that you honor
the memory of those men...

01:42:35.104 --> 01:42:38.483
...by buying the war bonds
and helping us to win this war.

01:42:38.691 --> 01:42:40.109
Thank you.

01:42:44.113 --> 01:42:48.076
City after city, I thought the damn thing
would never end.

01:42:48.409 --> 01:42:53.248
And this rumor kept going around
that the photograph had been staged.

01:42:54.917 --> 01:42:58.170
Your dad said he wished he'd known
he was having his picture taken...

01:42:58.379 --> 01:43:00.673
...because he would've ducked
the hell out of it.

01:43:00.881 --> 01:43:05.010
Was this your idea? Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?

01:43:05.135 --> 01:43:08.138
Was there truth to the rumor
that that picture was staged, Doc?

01:43:08.305 --> 01:43:11.183
- Come on! Doc?
- Can you answer that?

01:43:12.935 --> 01:43:17.147
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.

01:43:17.314 --> 01:43:20.734
People back home saw that picture...

01:43:20.943 --> 01:43:24.154
...and thought it was over
when we took Suribachi.

01:43:24.947 --> 01:43:26.657
We wished.

01:43:27.157 --> 01:43:33.330
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.

01:43:33.581 --> 01:43:36.333
Fire coming from every which direction,
right?

01:43:37.251 --> 01:43:41.630
And we hear somebody call,
"Corpsman down."

01:43:42.673 --> 01:43:45.175
Corpsman down!

01:43:51.223 --> 01:43:55.185
Blood was spurting out of his throat
and Doc was doing everything he could.

01:43:57.187 --> 01:44:00.774
And the corpsman looks up at him...

01:44:00.983 --> 01:44:04.194
...and he knows what this means,
shot in the neck.

01:44:05.195 --> 01:44:08.198
He knows he's dying, you can see that.

01:44:08.365 --> 01:44:12.201
But still, in his eyes...

01:44:12.202 --> 01:44:15.372
...he's pleading with Doc to save his life.

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:24.090
And Doc can't.

01:45:01.252 --> 01:45:04.631
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:45:04.839 --> 01:45:08.343
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.

01:45:08.551 --> 01:45:11.596
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:13.306
Okay.

01:45:20.146 --> 01:45:21.314
Corpsman.

01:45:21.523 --> 01:45:23.274
Corpsman!

01:45:24.526 --> 01:45:26.403
For God's sake, corpsman.

01:45:45.297 --> 01:45:47.091
Corpsman?

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.594
Corpsman.

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:54.890
Incoming!

01:45:57.893 --> 01:45:59.562
Let me see.

01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:05.316
It's not that bad, you're gonna be okay.
All right?

01:46:05.317 --> 01:46:07.361
Just stay with me. Look at me.

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:11.866
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.

01:46:12.074 --> 01:46:13.743
Coming down.

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:19.331
We got a chest wound.
Put pressure on it.

01:46:20.332 --> 01:46:22.001
Thanks.

01:46:26.047 --> 01:46:30.468
Vets will tell you about being hit
but not wanting to leave their buddies.

01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:33.345
Usually, they're lying.

01:46:33.596 --> 01:46:36.640
You'll take any excuse
to get out of there.

01:46:37.516 --> 01:46:39.602
But it happens.

01:46:41.353 --> 01:46:44.356
You get the feeling
you're letting them down.

01:46:45.399 --> 01:46:48.360
I could see that in your dad's face.

01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:51.489
Oh, he wanted to go.

01:46:51.906 --> 01:46:53.866
He'd seen enough.

01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:56.952
But he didn't want to leave us.

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.165
Now, he was a hell of a good man,
your dad.

01:47:04.794 --> 01:47:06.253
Yeah.

01:47:06.378 --> 01:47:08.381
While we were sitting there
on the beach...

01:47:08.423 --> 01:47:10.383
...we heard this great roar.

01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:11.802
And we looked up...

01:47:17.682 --> 01:47:21.061
That was the first of
thousands of landings on Iwo.

01:47:21.269 --> 01:47:23.396
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

01:47:23.814 --> 01:47:25.440
How about that.

01:47:31.404 --> 01:47:32.906
I'm gonna head back, all right?

01:47:33.115 --> 01:47:34.407
Good luck.

01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:40.413
That island saved a lot of lives.

01:47:43.667 --> 01:47:45.585
A lot of lives.

01:47:49.506 --> 01:47:51.883
I don't know what else to tell you.

01:48:00.559 --> 01:48:04.437
After the bond tour,
my dad finally got his operation.

01:48:15.615 --> 01:48:18.577
By the time he got home,
the war was over.

01:48:22.873 --> 01:48:25.876
First thing he did
was ask my mom to marry him.

01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:32.758
Ira tried to get on with his life
and put it all behind him.

01:48:34.552 --> 01:48:37.555
Like to thank you
for having me here today.

01:48:37.763 --> 01:48:43.895
It's an honor to be in front
of such a strong people.

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:48.608
Because of the war...

01:48:49.775 --> 01:48:53.946
...white men will understand Indians
a lot better.

01:48:56.490 --> 01:48:59.952
And it's going to be a better world.

01:49:19.263 --> 01:49:21.766
But life had other plans for him.

01:49:35.446 --> 01:49:37.698
You're- You're him, aren't you?

01:49:37.949 --> 01:49:39.867
You're the hero, right?

01:49:43.537 --> 01:49:46.666
Great. All right, kids,
go get your picture taken.

01:49:49.543 --> 01:49:51.003
Oh, that's great. That's great.

01:49:51.337 --> 01:49:52.713
All right, now say cheese.

01:49:52.964 --> 01:49:54.298
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

01:49:54.799 --> 01:49:58.553
That's great. Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks.

01:49:59.263 --> 01:50:01.848
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.

01:50:10.357 --> 01:50:15.570
Hey, hero, lift this basket, will you?

01:50:15.654 --> 01:50:17.739
It's too heavy for me.

01:50:42.306 --> 01:50:45.684
Rene tried to take advantage of those
offers he'd received on the bond tour.

01:50:45.892 --> 01:50:50.522
Yes, G-A-G-N-O-N.

01:50:50.605 --> 01:50:52.941
Right. Pronounced "Rene."

01:50:53.150 --> 01:50:54.484
Rene, yes.

01:50:55.110 --> 01:50:56.611
I actually called last week.

01:50:56.778 --> 01:50:59.865
Yes. Okay, yes. Mr. Gagnon.

01:51:00.073 --> 01:51:02.616
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.

01:51:02.617 --> 01:51:04.411
I'm sure he'll call you.

01:51:04.661 --> 01:51:05.996
Okay.

01:51:06.204 --> 01:51:07.622
All right...

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.541
...thank you.

01:51:09.624 --> 01:51:11.626
But he was yesterday's hero.

01:51:11.793 --> 01:51:15.589
He even applied for a job
at the local police station.

01:51:17.424 --> 01:51:19.635
They said he wasn't qualified.

01:51:19.802 --> 01:51:22.680
After working the factory with Pauline
he tried a few things...

01:51:22.889 --> 01:51:25.725
...but spent the rest of his life
as a janitor.

01:51:27.977 --> 01:51:29.020
But Ira...

01:51:29.228 --> 01:51:32.065
Ira. You got a visitor.

01:51:34.901 --> 01:51:36.819
Ira always made the news.

01:51:43.534 --> 01:51:47.997
I could never find out why he did it,
but one day Ira just took off.

01:52:30.873 --> 01:52:34.252
He walked and hitched
over 1300 miles...

01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:37.130
...from Arizona to Texas.

01:52:39.841 --> 01:52:43.094
He found Harlon Block's father
working his field.

01:52:43.302 --> 01:52:47.891
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after
they discovered Harlon died.

01:52:48.517 --> 01:52:52.062
She never forgave him
for letting her son go off to war.

01:53:10.038 --> 01:53:12.499
And Ira told him the truth.

01:53:13.333 --> 01:53:16.795
That it had been his son
who raised the flag with them...

01:53:17.337 --> 01:53:19.756
...his son in the photograph.

01:53:22.009 --> 01:53:24.761
And then he just turned
and walked away.

01:53:26.221 --> 01:53:29.433
Though the flag-raising
meant nothing to him...

01:53:29.683 --> 01:53:32.936
...he somehow knew
it would mean everything to them.

01:53:48.785 --> 01:53:50.787
Thanks for calling.

01:53:54.791 --> 01:53:57.377
Just as Belle knew all along.

01:54:06.386 --> 01:54:07.931
The press soon found out...

01:54:08.223 --> 01:54:12.602
...and called Hank's mom with the news
that it wasn't her son after all.

01:54:25.615 --> 01:54:27.408
The last time they all saw each other...

01:54:27.617 --> 01:54:30.828
...was at the unveiling of
the Marine Corps War Memorial.

01:54:32.121 --> 01:54:35.416
And even though he'd planted
the first flag above Iwo Jima...

01:54:35.833 --> 01:54:38.086
...Hank's mother and father
weren't invited.

01:55:15.873 --> 01:55:17.125
Ira.

01:55:29.679 --> 01:55:31.681
It's good to see you, Ira.

01:55:39.898 --> 01:55:41.900
Hell of a statue.

01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:57.958
It wasn't long after that
that they found Ira.

01:55:58.167 --> 01:56:00.918
The papers said he died of exposure.

01:56:00.919 --> 01:56:03.422
There was no autopsy.

01:56:17.353 --> 01:56:21.065
It was about that same time my father
got in his car early one morning...

01:56:21.273 --> 01:56:23.984
...telling my mom
he had something to do.

01:56:30.699 --> 01:56:35.204
He drove to a town on the other side
of Wisconsin, where Iggy's mom lived.

01:56:44.963 --> 01:56:47.091
Ever since she heard the news
about her son...

01:56:47.299 --> 01:56:51.970
...she'd been trying to find out how
he died, and no one would tell her.

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:55.641
I never found out what he told her...

01:56:56.141 --> 01:56:59.729
...but I can pretty much guarantee
it wasn't the truth.

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:03.316
My mother would ask him
what was troubling him.

01:57:03.525 --> 01:57:05.527
He would never say.

01:57:12.951 --> 01:57:15.787
And every year,
as it got close to Memorial Day...

01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:19.999
...the reporters would start calling,
asking to interview my father.

01:57:20.959 --> 01:57:24.003
No, I'm sorry, he's fishing in Canada.

01:57:24.587 --> 01:57:26.798
We were always instructed
to say the same thing.

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.007
Okay.

01:57:28.091 --> 01:57:29.718
Thanks.

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:34.013
When Mr. McCandless retired...

01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:37.976
...my father bought the funeral home
where he'd worked since coming home.

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:42.439
He spent the rest of his life
running the business and raising his family.

01:58:30.237 --> 01:58:33.449
He never spoke about the war
or about the flag-raising.

01:58:34.158 --> 01:58:36.368
Never told us anything.

01:58:36.577 --> 01:58:40.623
The first time I heard
any of these stories was after he died.

01:58:57.264 --> 01:58:59.098
Where is he?

01:58:59.099 --> 01:59:01.143
Oh, God.

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:04.563
He's not here, Dad.

01:59:05.105 --> 01:59:06.106
He died.

01:59:08.359 --> 01:59:11.111
Who? Who died?

01:59:11.570 --> 01:59:13.072
Iggy.

01:59:14.698 --> 01:59:16.283
Iggy.

01:59:17.159 --> 01:59:21.580
Christ, poor Iggy.

01:59:21.914 --> 01:59:24.834
I hadn't thought of him for years.

01:59:26.126 --> 01:59:28.587
How do you know about Iggy?

01:59:29.129 --> 01:59:31.215
You were calling for him.

01:59:31.674 --> 01:59:33.300
When you collapsed.

01:59:37.721 --> 01:59:40.933
I wasn't looking for Iggy.

01:59:42.142 --> 01:59:44.311
I was looking for you.

01:59:46.147 --> 01:59:48.149
I wanted to...

01:59:50.318 --> 01:59:55.031
I wanted to tell you, I'm-
I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.

01:59:56.157 --> 01:59:58.451
Talked to you more.

01:59:59.286 --> 02:00:00.620
I just...

02:00:04.416 --> 02:00:06.334
I'm sorry.

02:00:08.253 --> 02:00:09.838
Sorry?

02:00:11.423 --> 02:00:14.342
You were the best father
a man could have.

02:00:24.311 --> 02:00:28.857
Did I ever tell you
they took us swimming?

02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:33.987
No, Dad.

02:00:35.363 --> 02:00:40.869
After we planted the flag,
we came down off the mountain...

02:00:41.202 --> 02:00:43.371
...and they let us swim.

02:00:44.372 --> 02:00:47.208
It was the funniest thing.

02:00:47.959 --> 02:00:50.211
All this fighting and-

02:00:50.503 --> 02:00:54.257
And we were jumping around
in the water like kids.

02:00:57.802 --> 02:01:01.932
That's the way I remember Iggy now.

02:01:37.343 --> 02:01:41.138
I finally came to the conclusion
that maybe he was right.

02:01:41.263 --> 02:01:44.266
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.

02:01:44.433 --> 02:01:47.269
Maybe there are just people like my dad.

02:01:48.312 --> 02:01:51.399
I finally came to understand why they
were so uncomfortable...

02:01:51.607 --> 02:01:53.943
...being called heroes.

02:01:54.151 --> 02:01:58.406
Heroes are something we create,
something we need.

02:02:02.284 --> 02:02:06.455
It's a way for us to understand
what is almost incomprehensible...

02:02:06.706 --> 02:02:10.291
...how people could sacrifice
so much for us.

02:02:10.292 --> 02:02:12.545
But for my dad and these men...

02:02:12.753 --> 02:02:15.673
...the risks they took,
the wounds they suffered...

02:02:16.298 --> 02:02:18.551
...they did that for their buddies.

02:02:18.801 --> 02:02:22.346
They may have fought for their country,
but they died for their friends.

02:02:22.555 --> 02:02:26.308
For the man in front,
for the man beside them.

02:02:26.809 --> 02:02:29.812
And if we wish to truly
honor these men...

02:02:30.021 --> 02:02:32.857
...we should remember them
the way they really were...

02:02:33.065 --> 02:02:35.318
...the way my dad remembered them.

02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:17.360
Come on, Doc!
