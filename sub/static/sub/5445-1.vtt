[Man] when I was a kid,
Sundays were always the best.

01:32.639 --> 01:34.664
My father would
make a big breakfast.

01:34.741 --> 01:36.902
Scrambled eggs, waffles,
bacon...

01:36.977 --> 01:39.537
and he always made
the best bacon too.

01:39.613 --> 01:42.081
Then we would get
into our Cadillac.

01:42.149 --> 01:44.674
Boy, did he keep that car
waxed until it gleamed.

01:44.751 --> 01:47.777
Then we'd go off
on a new adventure.

01:47.854 --> 01:50.584
You never knew what was gonna happen next
with my father.

01:50.657 --> 01:52.682
You only knew
it was gonna be fun.

01:52.759 --> 01:55.319
Willie, you son of a bitch!

01:55.395 --> 01:59.297
My father was a big track star
when he was in school.

01:59.366 --> 02:01.926
- You should a seen him run.
- I see you, Willie!

- Your ass is grass! Come on, Louie!
- Get him, Daddy!

02:04.004 --> 02:08.633
- Don't fall behind!
- He owned most of the buildings in the neighborhood.

02:08.708 --> 02:11.199
And I'll tell you,
people really looked up to him.

02:11.278 --> 02:13.940
Deadbeat son of a bitch.
where's the rent?

02:14.014 --> 02:16.642
- I'm a little short right now. How 'bout another week?
- Another week?

02:16.716 --> 02:19.879
Another week? what do you say, Louie?
Should we give him another week?

02:19.953 --> 02:23.445
- Uh, okay.
- Okay? Really? You sure? Remember...

02:23.523 --> 02:26.287
that three dollars I give you every week
really isn't an allowance.

02:26.359 --> 02:28.293
It's more like a percentage.

02:28.361 --> 02:32.661
You let this guy skate,
that means you only get 2.70, okay?

02:32.732 --> 02:35.064
Remember. The other tenants
are gonna want another week.

02:35.135 --> 02:38.571

you'll be down to nothing. Zero. Zip!

- Nada. Zip. Zero.

Can I ask you a question?

10:28.041 --> 10:31.602
How far did you go in school?

10:31.678 --> 10:34.238
well, when I was
in high school...

10:34.314 --> 10:37.477
I wouldn't even let
a guy touch me, but...

to worry tomorrow.

10:46.859 --> 10:49.191
The judge will probably give you
a slap on the wrist, or a small fine.

10:49.262 --> 10:52.527
- what about the tenants?
- will you stop about the tenants?

10:52.598 --> 10:54.532
- You don't know.
The tenants are gonna be there.
- Remember.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.194

Louis Kritski, Junior...

brought before this court today.

11:26.632 --> 11:29.465
I will impose sentence
at this time.

11:29.535 --> 11:32.834
Mr. Kritski, it's within my prerogative
to sentence you...

11:32.905 --> 11:35.100
- to one year in the county jail.
- [Crowd Cheers]

11:37.143 --> 11:39.077

11:39.145 --> 11:42.876
- I'm not going to do that.
- Huh?

11:42.949 --> 11:48.114
In my opinion, threats of jail won't move you
to bring your building into compliance.

11:48.187 --> 11:52.749
Therefore, I am sentencing you to house arrest
in one of the apartments of your building...

11:52.825 --> 11:55.953
- [Laughter, Clapping]
- For a period of 120 days...

11:56.029 --> 11:58.190
or until the building
is brought up to code...

11:58.264 --> 12:00.255
as required
by the State of New York.

12:00.333 --> 12:05.066
Your Honor, respectfully, I really think
the maximum sentence is what's needed here.

12:05.138 --> 12:08.232
This city must send a message
to slumlords that they can't continue...

12:08.307 --> 12:11.640
Miss Bensinger, I believe that this sentence
will bring results.

12:11.711 --> 12:14.805
As counsel for the Housing Authority,
I expect you to report...

12:14.881 --> 12:18.442
any failure on Mr. Kritski's part to comply
with the directives of this court.

12:18.518 --> 12:22.818
Now, according
to the report I ordered...

12:22.889 --> 12:27.155
Apartment 5C in your building
is vacant, Mr. Kritski...

12:27.226 --> 12:30.218
and is listed by you as a...

12:30.296 --> 12:35.131
　Furnished, fifth-floor charmer
with a view, and close to shopping. "

12:35.201 --> 12:37.931
- [Man] what?
- You will move in immediately.

12:38.004 --> 12:41.132
You will reside there,
serving as the building superintendent.

12:41.207 --> 12:45.507
You will be allowed to leave only
to purchase food, for medical emergencies...

12:45.578 --> 12:47.910
and for business related
to the repair of the building.

12:47.980 --> 12:52.246
You may not renovate or alter Apartment 5C
to suit your needs...

12:52.318 --> 12:55.219
until the rest of the apartments in the building
have been brought into compliance.

12:55.288 --> 12:59.622
- [Big Lou] Oh, boy.
- Mr. Kritski, one more thing.

12:59.692 --> 13:03.355
If that building isn't
up to code in 120 days...

13:03.429 --> 13:06.489
- you will go to jail.

down at City Hall?

13:14.107 --> 13:16.667
well, you're not. You know why?
Because I'm gonna get a new lawyer.

13:16.742 --> 13:18.733
A white judge,
and I'm gonna appeal.

13:18.811 --> 13:21.143
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that you piss me off.

13:21.214 --> 13:23.148
[Louie] I thought you said
this lawyer was the best.

13:23.216 --> 13:25.810
[Big Lou] well, he was the best
in his price range. But don't worry.

13:25.885 --> 13:29.048

I'm not goin' anywhere.
No! My father'll have me out of there.

13:39.198 --> 13:42.031
I'm out of there. No way
I'm goin' to that shithole.

13:44.003 --> 13:46.563

Hey, Gilliam. Hey! No repairs
unless authorized by me. You ever hear that?

56:13.817 --> 56:16.877
It's not a repair.
It's more like a temporary blockade.

56:16.953 --> 56:20.047
- Blockade of what?
- This place is infested with vermin...

56:20.123 --> 56:23.251

see where they're coming from.

56:23.326 --> 56:25.624

chewthrough this...

for a night.

I've been upstairs.
I never saw one friggin' rat. Not one.

56:33.170 --> 56:37.436

out of professional courtesy.

- Anybody ever tell you you're a weirdo, Gilliam?

56:40.944 --> 56:43.071

somethin' you can do...

58:00.524 --> 58:02.458
just to keep 'em outta here,
you know what I mean?

58:02.526 --> 58:04.460
well, you could try
training 'em.

58:04.528 --> 58:07.156
That's very funny, pal.
Listen, you do whatever you gotta do.

58:07.230 --> 58:10.097

Shoot 'em. Nuke 'em. Burn 'em. I don't care.

58:10.167 --> 58:12.897
Fine.
I'll go start upstairs.

Obviously, it's unusually cold
in the building today...

to a malfunction of our boiler.

something to you.

Your grandmother
did the right thing.

01:02:15.078 --> 01:02:17.672
See, she couldn't let you
keep that bike...

01:02:17.747 --> 01:02:20.511
'cause if she let you keep that bike,
it's like saying...

whatever your father did
to get the money to buy the bike is okay.

01:02:26.189 --> 01:02:30.285

And, um, she can't do that, because...

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.023
well, what your father does...
he does bad things.

01:02:34.097 --> 01:02:37.726
- So do you.
- I mean, it might look like that to...

01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:41.134
to you 'cause you're a little kid,
but, um, I mean, uh...

01:02:41.204 --> 01:02:43.764
there's a big difference
between your father and me.

- No. I'm a businessman.

you might actually make some people happy.

But your daddy wouldn't like that.
