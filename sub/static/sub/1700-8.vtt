WEBVTT

00:07.882 --> 00:10.134
Hey, gorgeous. How's it going?

00:10.385 --> 00:13.387
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.889
Does it get better than this?

00:16.599 --> 00:19.018
Question: You're not dating, are you?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.854
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.440
You see, perfect might be a problem.

00:24.691 --> 00:28.235
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive...

00:28.987 --> 00:31.196
- You want a date Saturday?
- Yes, please.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.324
He is cute.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.744
- He's funny. He's...
- He's a he?

00:36.953 --> 00:38.370
Well, yeah.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.206
Oh, God. I just...

00:42.333 --> 00:43.625
You're nice... Oh, God.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.671
Good, Shelly. Okay. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.048
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:37.222 --> 01:41.100
It's hard to enjoy noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

01:41.351 --> 01:43.936
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.646
Um...

01:45.980 --> 01:47.022
Yeah.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.902
Well, when I first met you,
I thought maybe...

01:52.153 --> 01:53.237
...possibly...

01:53.488 --> 01:54.530
...you might be.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.657
You did?

01:56.908 --> 02:00.244
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts...

02:00.495 --> 02:02.287
...so then I figured maybe not.

02:03.998 --> 02:08.961
Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

02:09.169 --> 02:10.294
- I did.
- I think so.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.050
- Not me.
- No, no, me neither.

02:15.927 --> 02:19.221
Although, uh, back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.931
You're kidding.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.517
- Did you tell her I wasn't?
- No.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.354
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.983
So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman...

02:33.528 --> 02:34.820
...who also liked her.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.702
Well, this is fascinating.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.204
So, uh, what is it about me?

02:44.914 --> 02:48.167
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny...

02:48.418 --> 02:50.752
Ross is smart and funny.
You ever think that about him?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.672
- Ha, ha. Yeah, right.
- What is it?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.927
Okay, I don't know. You just...
You have a quality.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.554
- Yes, exactly.
- Right?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.222
Yeah, a quality.

03:02.390 --> 03:06.518
"A quality." Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.773
Hello?

03:12.442 --> 03:13.859
Oh. Rachel.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.736
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.906
Oh, my God. Calling from Rome.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.997
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.166
Just gotta go to Rome.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.713
Monica, your dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

03:34.964 --> 03:39.009
I'm talking to Rome.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.720
Hey, Dad. What's up?

03:43.723 --> 03:44.890
Oh, God.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.976
Ross, it's Nana.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.611
Hey.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.448
- How you doing?
- Hey, Dad.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.328
So, uh, how's she doing?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.498
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.876
- How are you, Mom?
- Me? I'm fine, fine.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.962
I'm glad you're here.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.048
What's with your hair?

04:18.298 --> 04:19.423
What?

04:19.968 --> 04:21.009
What's different?

04:21.344 --> 04:22.386
Nothing.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.972
Oh, maybe that's it.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.349
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's...

04:27.558 --> 04:28.850
Okay, relax, relax.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.603
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.648
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.233
Oh, God.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.158
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.827
Oh.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.413
Yeah, they were gross.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.040
Oh, you know what I love?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.084
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.504
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.799
Not just restaurants,
from our house.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.384
Mrs. Geller?

05:08.391 --> 05:09.725
She looks so small.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.226
I know.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.814
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.153
Goodbye, Nana.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.328
Bye, Nana.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.291
Ross!

05:36.002 --> 05:37.085
Nurse.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.921
What is going on?

05:40.798 --> 05:43.550
You know, uh, how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.302
Well, she's not quite.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.139
- What?
- She's not passed.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.767
She's present. She's back.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.268
What's going on?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.187
She may have died.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.314
"She may have died"?

05:57.565 --> 05:58.857
We're looking into it.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.361
Uh, I'll go see.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.157
This almost never happens.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.760
Now she's passed.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.688
I just have to know, okay?

06:39.273 --> 06:40.524
Is it my hair?

06:41.109 --> 06:44.152
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.571
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.577
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.788
So did she?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.665
Twice.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.502
Oh, that sucks.

07:02.797 --> 07:03.880
You guys okay?

07:04.340 --> 07:05.966
I don't know. It's weird.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.719
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel, uh...

07:10.054 --> 07:11.930
Maybe that's because
she's not really gone.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.640
No, no, she's gone.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.851
We checked.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.352
A lot.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.606
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.734
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then...

07:24.986 --> 07:28.738
...I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

07:32.660 --> 07:35.328
Oh. And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high...

07:35.538 --> 07:38.665
...got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.461
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe...

07:42.712 --> 07:45.130
...whenever I use
one of those little yellow pencils.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.094
I miss her.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.513
Aw. Here, Pheebs.

07:53.764 --> 07:54.848
Want this?

07:55.016 --> 07:57.058
- Oh, thanks.
- Sure.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.519
I just sharpened her this morning.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.941
See, I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead...

08:05.193 --> 08:07.694
...you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.700
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

08:17.955 --> 08:20.790
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.383
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.553
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.061
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.188
I don't see why not.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.542
Here's my retainer.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.761
I was just thinking...

09:15.096 --> 09:16.972
...when my time comes...
- Dad.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.431
Listen to me.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.895
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.524
You what?

09:28.442 --> 09:31.653
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.240
Define "fun."

09:35.449 --> 09:39.578
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch...

09:39.870 --> 09:44.207
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.917
Everyone thinks they know me.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.254
Everyone says, "Jack Geller,
so predictable."

09:49.505 --> 09:54.259
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
"Buried at sea? Huh."

09:57.638 --> 09:59.723
That's probably what they'll say.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.850
I'd like that.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.947
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.075
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

10:19.327 --> 10:23.622
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.583
Oh. Okay. Phew.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.088
So, uh, what do you think it is about me?

10:33.257 --> 10:34.466
I don't know what.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.551
You just have...

10:36.761 --> 10:38.637
...a quality.
- A quality. Right. Great.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.849
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

10:44.685 --> 10:48.813
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

10:49.106 --> 10:50.190
What? He's cute.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.775
Well, yeah.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.194
He's no Brian in Payroll.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.239
Is Brian?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.993
No. I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up...

11:02.203 --> 11:05.080
...I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.791
Well, I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.841
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

11:19.804 --> 11:23.098
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.267
I'm really not.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.728
This one?

11:30.481 --> 11:32.065
No.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.694
I've shown you every dress we have.

11:35.945 --> 11:39.864
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...

11:40.116 --> 11:42.242
...go with the burgundy.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.204
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.623
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.626
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.545
Wait. We need shoes.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.844
Okay. Uh...

12:02.054 --> 12:03.096
How about these?

12:03.806 --> 12:05.473
That's really a day shoe.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.810
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

12:10.271 --> 12:12.313
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

12:16.444 --> 12:21.656
Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.410
I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.621
No, it really should be burgundy.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.166
- Unless we go with a different dress.
- Yes.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.376
No, no, no. Watch this.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.838
Wait, I may have something in the back.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.852
Oh, my God.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.021
Is everything all right, dear?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.064
Yeah. Yeah.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.026
Just Nana's stuff.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.545
How we doing?
You guys ready?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.548
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.134
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

13:23.385 --> 13:25.637
Some days it's all I can think about.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.516
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.601
Heh. You mean your earrings?

13:32.186 --> 13:33.394
What did I say?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.942
- Are these the shoes?
- Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.237
What? We, uh, don't have shoes here?

13:44.448 --> 13:46.241
Morning. We ready to go?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.451
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

13:50.246 --> 13:52.455
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

14:04.385 --> 14:07.512
- It was a beautiful service.
- It really was.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.307
Come here, sweetheart.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.603
You know...

14:16.730 --> 14:19.649
...I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.823
What?

14:27.032 --> 14:30.577
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.372
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.584
You're watching football at a funeral?

14:37.835 --> 14:41.546
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.883
You're a frightening, frightening man.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.469
Oh, no. My new Paolo shoes.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.139
Oh. I hope they're not ruined.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.478
God, what a great day.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.356
What? Weatherwise.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.192
I know.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.279
The air, the trees.

15:06.822 --> 15:10.950
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost, uh, life...

15:12.995 --> 15:14.913
- Ross, are you okay?
- Ross!

15:15.164 --> 15:16.497
I'm fine. No, I'm fine.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.292
Just...

15:19.543 --> 15:21.920
...having my worst fear
realized, but...

15:30.304 --> 15:33.348
I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.767
- Huh.
- What? What is it?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.560
- You missed a belt loop.
- Ugh.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.940
Okay, it's in spasm.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.817
Here, sweetie. Here.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.195
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.488
Thanks, Mom.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.039
Sorry.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.500
Hi, I'm Andrea.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.877
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.631
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.177
Hey, look who's up.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.471
- Hey.
- How do you feel?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.349
I feel great.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.269
I feel great. I feel great.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.815
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?

16:24.233 --> 16:27.110
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two, whew.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.365
I love you guys.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.412
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.872
I love Pheebs. Ha.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.041
- That's so nice.
- Hey.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.669
- Chandler.
- Hey.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.878
I love you, man.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.216
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.138
It doesn't matter to me.

16:56.890 --> 16:57.932
You were right.

17:03.522 --> 17:07.108
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.321
I love you the most.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.368
Well, you know who I love the most?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.122
- No.
- You.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.251
Oh, you don't get it.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.967
- Aw!
- What do you got there?

17:33.343 --> 17:36.387
Uh, just a, uh, hearing disability.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.389
What's the score?

17:39.975 --> 17:43.102
17-14, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.395
Beautiful.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.741
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.329
Your grandmother would've hated this.

18:02.372 --> 18:05.333
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.921
No, I'd be hearing about...

18:10.172 --> 18:12.840
...why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham?

18:13.092 --> 18:16.677
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say:

18:16.970 --> 18:20.306
"Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead."

18:21.225 --> 18:22.934
That sounds like Nana.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.979
Do you know what it's like
to grow up...

18:27.564 --> 18:31.943
...with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

18:34.571 --> 18:35.738
I can imagine.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.826
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out...

18:40.077 --> 18:43.204
...to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.999
That is a wonder.

18:49.586 --> 18:54.382
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again...

18:54.633 --> 18:57.677
...I mean, if she was here right now...

18:58.220 --> 18:59.428
...would you tell her?

19:00.013 --> 19:01.055
Tell her what?

19:02.516 --> 19:07.019
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.313
Like your hair, for example.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.776
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.823
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

19:22.578 --> 19:23.744
No.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.082
I think some things are
better left unsaid.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.210
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.131
Ha.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.424
More wine, dear?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.509
Oh, I think so.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.437
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.857
Thank you.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.942
They're yours.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.945
Actually, they were Nana's.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.157
No!

20:02.576 --> 20:04.368
Now I'm depressed.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.042
Even more than I was.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.843
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.179
Uh, that little naked guy would be me.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.557
Aw. Look at the little thing.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.979
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.607
Can we be grownups now?

20:35.317 --> 20:37.818
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.572
- That's Nana right there in the middle.
- Wow.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.907
Yeah, let's see.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.826
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

20:46.036 --> 20:48.204
Wow. Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.622
How old was she there?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.749
Let's see. "1939."

20:52.376 --> 20:54.001
Uh, twenty-four, twenty-five.

20:54.211 --> 20:57.088
Huh. It looks like a fun gang.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.138
Ooh, look, look, look.
I got Monica naked.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.848
Let me see.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.353
No, no. That would be me again.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.568
I'm, uh, just trying something.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.748
- Hey, Lowell.
- Oh, hey, Chandler.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.420
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

21:37.671 --> 21:40.965
It's like Mardi Gras without
the papier-mâché heads.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.300
How about you?

21:42.509 --> 21:46.178
Good. Good. Listen, um, heh...

21:46.346 --> 21:49.473
...I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but, uh...

21:50.600 --> 21:51.976
...I'm not.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.313
I know. That's what I told her.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.981
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.067
So you can tell?

22:01.945 --> 22:06.324
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.036
So you don't think I have...

22:10.203 --> 22:11.245
...a quality?

22:12.080 --> 22:16.083
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.881
By the way, your friend Brian
from Payroll? He is.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.507
- He is?
- Yep.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.634
And way out of your league.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.973
Out of my league.

22:31.224 --> 22:35.353
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.438
Hey, Brian.
