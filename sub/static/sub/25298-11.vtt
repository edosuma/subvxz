08:35.555 --> 08:36.846
We're so close!

08:36.846 --> 08:40.560
Uh, Andromeda, even if
the gargoyles don't wake up,

08:40.560 --> 08:41.731
we could still
hang out, ri--

08:41.731 --> 08:43.903
Oh! What are you doin?!

08:43.903 --> 08:46.906
Oh, it's time
to wake up, buddy!

08:46.906 --> 08:48.908
Tilly, get the camera!

08:48.908 --> 08:50.700
Ooo... okay.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.991
[panting]

08:51.991 --> 08:55.615
I just climbed a million stairs
to save your butt!

08:55.615 --> 08:56.866
Oh, my gosh!
What's she doin'?!

08:59.829 --> 09:01.621
Tilly, you gotta come clean!

09:01.621 --> 09:03.753
But I don't want to
lose my friend!

09:03.753 --> 09:04.834
Well, you're gonna
lose her anyway

09:04.834 --> 09:06.796
when she falls
off the building!

09:06.796 --> 09:08.838
Andromeda, climb back!

09:08.838 --> 09:10.880
He's not going to wake up!

09:10.880 --> 09:12.762
No, no, no,
I think it's working.

09:12.762 --> 09:15.595
Whoa! Oh, no!
The magic hammer!

09:15.595 --> 09:17.637
Andromeda, listen!

09:17.637 --> 09:19.979
I lied.
I made the whole thing up.

09:19.979 --> 09:21.771
The gargoyles aren't magic.

09:21.771 --> 09:22.982
They're just ugly statues.

09:22.982 --> 09:25.855
Now please
get off the ledge!

09:25.855 --> 09:28.988
What?
Tilly, you lied to me?

09:28.988 --> 09:30.900
Don't stand up! Don't stand up!

09:30.900 --> 09:32.902
Oh, and I guess
the magic hammer

09:32.902 --> 09:35.034
isn't really magic, either!

09:35.034 --> 09:36.786
Well, if you believe it is--

09:36.786 --> 09:38.868
No, that was a lie, too.

09:38.868 --> 09:41.040
I thought you were
a truth-teller like me,

09:41.040 --> 09:43.963
but now I can see you're
just a teller of lies!

09:43.963 --> 09:45.705
Whoa-oh! Ohh!

09:45.705 --> 09:46.706
Andromeda!

09:46.706 --> 09:47.917
Whoa! Ohh!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
I'm sorry. I just--
I don't know.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.923
I just wanted
to be friends with you.

09:53.923 --> 09:55.675
What? Really?

09:55.675 --> 09:56.846
Yeah!

09:56.846 --> 09:58.098
Aw, this is really sweet
and everything,

09:58.098 --> 10:00.019
but let's get off this roof
before we all die!

10:00.019 --> 10:01.681
Oh!

10:01.681 --> 10:03.773
So, uh, we're--
we're cool, right?

10:03.773 --> 10:06.726
Do you wanna maybe
hang out tomorrow?

10:06.726 --> 10:09.989
Uh, I got
a lot of conspiracies
to catch up on.

10:09.989 --> 10:11.731
I gotta go.

10:11.731 --> 10:13.823
[sighs] Ohh!

10:13.823 --> 10:15.825
Oh, Tilly, Tilly, Tilly.

10:15.825 --> 10:18.948
Let's go. I'm freezin'.

10:18.948 --> 10:20.950
-I'm chasin' ya!
I'm chasin' ya!
-[Remy laughing]

10:20.950 --> 10:23.623
Okay, you chase me!
Remy, chase me!

10:24.874 --> 10:27.707
I almost had
a best friend once,

10:27.707 --> 10:29.048
but I had to go
and chase her away

10:29.048 --> 10:32.712
with my tall tales
and deceits. [blows]

10:32.712 --> 10:34.804
-[knock on door]
-Hmm?

10:34.804 --> 10:36.846
Hello?

10:36.846 --> 10:38.758
What's this?

10:38.758 --> 10:41.971
"Tilly, sorry I had
to ditch you last night.

10:41.971 --> 10:43.723
[Andromeda]
<i> Too many witnesses!</i>

10:43.723 --> 10:45.145
<i> Meet me at the park--
got a new lead.</i>

10:45.145 --> 10:47.767
<i> Officer Keys is an alien?</i>

10:47.767 --> 10:49.028
<i> Think about it.</i>

10:49.028 --> 10:50.820
<i> Your friend, Andromeda.</i>

10:50.820 --> 10:52.772
<i> P.S. Destroy this letter."</i>

11:02.992 --> 11:06.746
Green Family Farms
is officially open for business!

11:06.746 --> 11:08.748
I can't believe
we're selling our goods

11:08.748 --> 11:09.999
at a real-life
farmers' market.

11:09.999 --> 11:12.172
Green Farms was
a trusted name back home.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.794
It's a big day
for your old man, Tilly,

11:14.794 --> 11:16.796
a big day
for all of us.

11:16.796 --> 11:19.719
That's why I brought
some extra help
to work the stand.

11:19.719 --> 11:20.930
His name is Saxon.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.852
He has
a keen business acumen

11:22.852 --> 11:25.104
and is well respected
within his community.

11:25.104 --> 11:27.937
"I have a master's degree!"

11:27.937 --> 11:29.899
Well, hi, Saxon.

11:29.899 --> 11:32.151
You can be in charge
of baggin' everything up!

11:32.151 --> 11:33.863
Don't patronize him.

11:33.863 --> 11:35.114
-Dad! Dad.
-Aah!

11:35.114 --> 11:37.737
I saw this guy eating
a cinnamon dough stick.

11:37.737 --> 11:39.779
I think it was
called a "churro."

11:39.779 --> 11:41.201
-Can I get one?
-Sorry, son.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.703
We're here to make money,
not spend it.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.035
Tell you what, maybe if we
sell all these veggies,

11:46.035 --> 11:47.957
then you can have
some "churrios."

11:47.957 --> 11:50.039
Well then, what are we doing
sitting around lollygagging?

11:50.039 --> 11:52.882
[grunts]
Come one, come all!

11:52.882 --> 11:55.044
We got the best produce
in the farmers' market!

11:55.044 --> 11:57.176
Hey, you! You look
a little on the short side.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.929
One of our special squashes
will make you taller!

11:59.929 --> 12:01.931
Aw, come on, man!

12:01.931 --> 12:03.182
With one taste
of our cabbage,

12:03.182 --> 12:04.974
you could be cured
of any illness!

12:04.974 --> 12:06.846
And you, behold!

12:06.846 --> 12:09.229
The apple of enlightenment.

12:09.229 --> 12:13.022
When eaten, it grants
the user psychic powers!

12:13.022 --> 12:15.114
Psychic powers?
I'll take ten!

12:15.114 --> 12:16.195
What the--?

12:16.195 --> 12:18.948
[chuckles] Sorry.
Boy is exaggerating.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.950
All we can offer
is a darn good apple.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.912
I just wanted
to be psychic.

12:22.912 --> 12:25.034
Way to go, Dad!
That rube was gonna buy it.

12:25.034 --> 12:27.247
Cricket, for the last time,
they're not rubes!

12:27.247 --> 12:28.868
They're customers!

12:28.868 --> 12:30.750
How do you expect
to sell products

12:30.750 --> 12:32.171
without... pizazz?

12:32.171 --> 12:35.925
In my opinion,
the world could do with
a little less "pizazz."

12:35.925 --> 12:37.927
[snaps] Hey, buddy.
Guy. Buddy.

12:37.927 --> 12:39.178
Hey, are
these crops organic?

12:39.178 --> 12:40.930
If you're asking if my crops

12:40.930 --> 12:43.182
are grown the way
nature intended, then yes!

12:43.182 --> 12:46.185
Ha-ha! Yeah!
The simple farmer bit!

12:46.185 --> 12:48.017
That is great!

12:48.017 --> 12:51.100
You even dressed your kids
in rags to complete
the picture.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.191
I can't see nothin'!

12:52.191 --> 12:54.153
Chip Whistler.
I'm the manager

12:54.153 --> 12:56.155
of the local
Wholesome Foods grocery store,

12:56.155 --> 12:58.818
and I am uh...

12:58.818 --> 13:01.281
Ahem. Well, we had a problem
with our organic shipment

13:01.281 --> 13:03.863
and need an alternate supply
for the week.

13:03.863 --> 13:06.826
-There is big money in it!
-Ooh!

13:06.826 --> 13:09.168
Chumps'll pay twice as much
for organic whatever.

13:09.168 --> 13:10.290
Am I right?

13:10.290 --> 13:13.172
Yeah. I also like good food.

13:13.172 --> 13:15.044
And we've got
plenty of it, Chip.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.797
Hi. Cricket Green,
vegetable specialist.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.050
Very cool.
So, we need 20 bushels
of assorted produce.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.972
Are you my guy?

13:22.972 --> 13:26.806
Wow! Oh, I'm sorry
to tell you this, Chip,

13:26.806 --> 13:28.848
but I don't have enough
to fill the order.

13:28.848 --> 13:31.020
I'm gonna have
to respectfully decline.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.191
Whaaaat?

13:32.191 --> 13:34.354
Your loss, Trucker Hat.
Have a nice life.

13:34.354 --> 13:36.235
-Wait, come back!
-He's gone.

13:36.235 --> 13:38.027
Dad, why'd you pass
on that deal?

13:38.027 --> 13:39.939
I thought we were here
to make some money.

13:39.939 --> 13:42.031
We are,
but a good businessman

13:42.031 --> 13:44.203
never promises more
than what he can deliver.

13:44.203 --> 13:46.866
There's just no way
we could've filled that order.

13:48.037 --> 13:49.909
Or is there?

13:49.909 --> 13:51.250
A way.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.252
To fill that order.

13:53.252 --> 13:55.254
-What'd you say?
-[chuckles] Nothing.

13:55.254 --> 13:57.126
[sniffing]

13:57.126 --> 13:58.297
Nah!

13:58.297 --> 13:59.959
Uh, sir?

13:59.959 --> 14:02.051
Aah! No handouts today,
street urchin!

14:02.051 --> 14:03.963
Oh, wait, you're
that farmer's kid!

14:03.963 --> 14:05.845
[chuckles] Yeah.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.927
When my dad said
we couldn't make the order,

14:07.927 --> 14:10.059
see, he was just driving
one of them hard bargains.

14:10.059 --> 14:12.101
Of course we can come up
with enough produce.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.854
What kind of farmers
would we be
if we couldn't?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.186
Bad ones? I don't know.
I don't know anything
about farming.

14:17.186 --> 14:19.148
But you have got a deal,
little guy!

14:19.148 --> 14:21.150
Here's the order list.
Give this to your old man.

14:21.150 --> 14:24.033
I'll be back
in an hour with a truck
to pick everything up.

14:24.033 --> 14:25.074
Bye-bye!

14:25.074 --> 14:27.076
Pleasure doing
business with ya!

14:27.076 --> 14:28.247
Papa ain't
gonna like this.

14:28.247 --> 14:29.288
[startles] Tilly!

14:29.288 --> 14:31.040
He didn't want
to do the deal.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.202
Don't make me
a whistleblower.

14:33.202 --> 14:35.044
Dad doesn't know
what he's doing.

14:35.044 --> 14:37.206
He said he wants
to sell his produce
and make some money,

14:37.206 --> 14:39.128
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do for him.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.300
I'm trying to put
Green Family Farms on the map.

14:41.300 --> 14:45.304
Hmm. I'd like to consult Saxon,
my financial advisor.

14:45.304 --> 14:48.307
"Makes dollars
and cents to me!"

14:48.307 --> 14:50.009
All right,
we're on board.

14:50.009 --> 14:52.972
But how do you plan
on filling the order?

14:52.972 --> 14:56.355
Tilly, a great businessman
always says yes and figures out
the rest later!

14:56.355 --> 14:58.107
Well, Dad wasn't lying.

14:58.107 --> 15:00.399
We really do only have enough
to fill half the order.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.321
What are we
gonna do now, Cricket?

15:02.321 --> 15:04.984
Hmm...

15:04.984 --> 15:08.077
Now we get... creative.

15:26.215 --> 15:27.256
Well, Tilly, we did it.

15:27.256 --> 15:28.928
Let's go fill that order!

15:28.928 --> 15:31.350
Hmm? Hee-hee!

15:33.102 --> 15:34.103
Ugh.

15:34.103 --> 15:35.354
[sighs] Poor guy.

15:35.354 --> 15:38.107
Tilly, I need you to go get
Dad away from the stand.

15:38.107 --> 15:39.358
Hi, Papa!

15:39.358 --> 15:42.482
Will you come see
the balloon man with me?

15:42.482 --> 15:45.485
You're a big girl, honey.
I think you can manage.

15:45.485 --> 15:47.156
I suppose so.

15:47.156 --> 15:49.408
I am getting older
and more independent.

15:49.408 --> 15:53.412
Who knows
how much more quality time
we have left together.

15:55.034 --> 15:57.376
I suppose five minutes
can't hurt none.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.253
Looking good!

16:04.253 --> 16:07.086
-Ooh, except for that.
-Hey! There he is.

16:07.086 --> 16:09.138
Huh? Oh, Chip!
My man!

16:09.138 --> 16:12.181
Whoo! Green Family Farms
is not messin' around!

16:12.181 --> 16:15.394
That's right,
and it's all above board,
100% delicious.

16:15.394 --> 16:17.436
Not a single tennis ball
in the bunch.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.228
Tennis ball
in the bunch, ha!

16:19.228 --> 16:21.310
I love your folksy
country sayings.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.022
Well, a deal's a deal.

16:23.022 --> 16:25.484
Here's a little scratch
for your batch.

16:25.484 --> 16:29.108
Oh, it was a pleasure
doing business with you, sir.

16:29.108 --> 16:31.030
Don't go spending that
all in one place, now,

16:31.030 --> 16:32.281
unless it's
at Wholesome Foods.

16:32.281 --> 16:34.203
Then spend away, baby!

16:34.203 --> 16:36.455
Balloon man!
Balloon man!

16:38.998 --> 16:41.420
That's nice, but Saxon
wanted a snake.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.172
[no audible dialogue]

16:44.173 --> 16:46.425
Oh, my gosh, it's perfect.

16:46.425 --> 16:49.508
Oh, boy, um,
I'm a little short.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.181
Would you accept
an apple?

16:54.183 --> 17:00.189
My word! This is the best thing
I have ever tasted!

17:00.189 --> 17:02.271
Hey, everyone,
that man's apple is so good

17:02.271 --> 17:05.234
it made the balloon mime
break his ten-year vow
of silence!

17:05.234 --> 17:07.316
[exclaiming]

17:07.316 --> 17:09.318
Take us
to your stand!

17:09.318 --> 17:11.360
Oh, of course!

17:11.360 --> 17:13.362
All right,
everybody, dig in!

17:13.362 --> 17:16.455
[wind whooshes]

17:16.455 --> 17:19.118
Empty? Why is it empty?

17:19.118 --> 17:21.080
We sold out
of everything, Dad!

17:21.080 --> 17:23.252
[grumbling]

17:23.252 --> 17:25.464
Dad, look at this fat wad
of cash I made!

17:25.464 --> 17:27.466
Green Family Farms
is a success!

17:27.466 --> 17:29.468
You're welcome.

17:29.468 --> 17:33.052
Cricket, there's no way
we could've sold out
in five minutes.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.133
What did you do?!

17:34.133 --> 17:35.344
Turns out we just needed

17:35.344 --> 17:37.476
to broaden our definition
of "acceptable quality."

17:37.476 --> 17:39.178
We made fake food!

17:39.178 --> 17:41.310
I painted tennis balls
to look like to peaches.

17:45.184 --> 17:47.106
Oh, yeah,
that was great.

17:47.106 --> 17:51.190
Kids! What do you think
will happen when people
eat your fake food?

17:51.190 --> 17:52.361
Uh, gee, Dad,
I don't know.

17:52.361 --> 17:54.113
You really think
ten steps ahead.

17:54.113 --> 17:55.534
At most
that's like two!

17:55.534 --> 17:57.536
I need you to think
about this.

17:57.536 --> 18:00.369
<i> Folks are gonna eat
that fake food,</i>

18:00.369 --> 18:02.541

18:02.541 --> 18:06.165

Farms will be ruined!</i>

18:06.165 --> 18:09.298

produce in the city again!</i>

18:09.298 --> 18:11.510
<i> And then who knows
what'll happen!</i>

18:11.510 --> 18:14.423
No!

I can fix this.
I can fix this!

18:16.345 --> 18:18.097
Follow me.

18:20.429 --> 18:24.103
Careful. Let's not draw
any attention to ourselves.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.145
Uh-oh, look over there,
everybody!

18:26.145 --> 18:27.356
It's the Greens!

18:27.356 --> 18:29.438
Yes, they're responsible
for all the fruit

18:29.438 --> 18:31.320
and vegetables
in the store today!

that made the fruit!

Let's hear it
for the humble farmer himself!

I'll leave these rubes
to you, buddy.

18:42.501 --> 18:44.413
Dad, you gotta
distract the crowd.

go get the fake fruit.

-Thank you!

19:31.290 --> 19:34.383
And don't get me started
on the fertilizer!

19:34.383 --> 19:35.675
Come on, Dad,

Dad, I'm sorry I risked
our reputation to make
a quick buck.

20:00.319 --> 20:03.412
I tried to take a shortcut,
but I ended up getting lost.

Aw, don't beat
yourself up, Cricket.

and Papa's honesty combined,

20:17.636 --> 20:19.638
you make one perfect salesman!

20:19.638 --> 20:21.550
Heh, maybe
you're right, Tilly.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.642

this fake produce.
