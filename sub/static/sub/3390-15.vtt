WEBVTT

00:53.033 --> 00:54.500
Shut up and answer the question.

00:56.466 --> 00:59.666
Hyun-jun interrogates Seung-hee,
who infiltrated alone into their hideout.

00:59.866 --> 01:01.433
However, he fails to get the security code

01:01.900 --> 01:04.500
and sends Seung-hee back
at San Baek's request.

01:06.466 --> 01:07.333
Let her go.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.900
Forget everything about me, Seung-hee.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.666
Seung-hee!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.533
Hyun-jun, chasing after the clue
left by the owner of the voice,

01:23.066 --> 01:26.400
meets Myung-ho Cho in secret,
reveals identity of Iris,

01:26.800 --> 01:28.966
and warns him
against the nuclear terror attack

01:33.266 --> 01:34.433
I think there's a mole

01:35.033 --> 01:36.766
inside the NSS.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.200
Sang-hyun, suspicious of Director Baek
and Sa-woo,

01:41.566 --> 01:44.900
starts to track down
the terrorists with Seung-hee.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.466
On the other hand,
Chul-young tries to contact Sun-hwa

01:52.800 --> 01:54.666
in order to stop Gi-hoon Yeon's plan,

01:55.133 --> 01:57.333
but he ends up
being kidnapped by Hyun-jun.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.333
If you don't answer my question right now,

02:05.400 --> 02:06.266
you'll die.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.000
EPISODE 15

03:02.500 --> 03:04.066
I don't have time to waste.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.866
If you don't answer my question right now,

03:06.200 --> 03:07.133
you will die.

03:07.566 --> 03:08.533
Where am I?

03:08.733 --> 03:10.200
Did Do-chul Kang order you to do this?

03:10.266 --> 03:11.333
Just answer my question.

03:11.766 --> 03:13.400
The enriched uranium and the detonator,

03:14.633 --> 03:15.566
Where are they?

03:20.166 --> 03:23.066
You're the one who was with Do-chul Kang.
Why are you asking me?

03:36.800 --> 03:37.733
Will it be okay?

03:38.333 --> 03:39.966
He's part of the North's delegation.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.333
I'll ask you for the last time.

03:47.266 --> 03:49.333
Where is the nuclear bomb?

03:49.833 --> 03:51.766
Why are you looking for it now?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.166
Did you have a sudden change in mind?

03:54.866 --> 03:57.766
Your purpose was to take revenge
on San Baek and South Korea, wasn't it?

03:58.533 --> 04:00.400
I don't know where it is either.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.133
Now I can't keep my promise

04:02.533 --> 04:05.233
to help you with the revenge.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.333
Do-chul Kang betrayed me.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.400
Stop talking nonsense.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.900
I already know you and San Baek are Iris.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.600
Iris...

04:18.566 --> 04:19.766
What's that?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.766
I don't know
what you're talking about now,

04:28.200 --> 04:30.633
but I didn't mean to set off
the bomb from the beginning.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.166
My plan was

04:32.600 --> 04:35.733
to stop the summit
by threatening with the nuclear bomb.

04:36.233 --> 04:37.133
However...

04:38.400 --> 04:39.666
I learned a while ago

04:41.000 --> 04:42.433
that I was being used.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.933
Do-chul Kang, who has the nuclear bomb,

04:46.500 --> 04:49.066
is receiving orders from Gi-hoon Yeon,

04:49.133 --> 04:51.033
the North Korean delegate for the summit.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.933
I'm not sure what Iris is,

04:55.300 --> 04:56.800
but if it's connected with San Baek,

05:00.500 --> 05:01.566
it won't be me,

05:02.733 --> 05:03.866
it will be Gi-hoon Yeon.

05:09.066 --> 05:10.233
Now Gi-Hoon Yeon is preparing

05:11.233 --> 05:14.500
to set off a nuke in the middle of Seoul,
trying to declare a war.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.066
I don't want a war.

05:17.933 --> 05:19.400
The reason I contacted Sun-hwa was

05:19.933 --> 05:22.533
to find the nuke
that went beyond my control.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.966
Have you seen Sun-hwa and Hyun-jun Kim?

06:05.233 --> 06:06.500
No, not for a while now, sir.

06:07.566 --> 06:09.000
Well, they're pretty annoying.

06:10.533 --> 06:11.566
Let's get rid of them.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.200
Sir...

06:17.766 --> 06:20.566
Sun-hwa Kim left after talking
to Chul-young Park on the phone.

06:21.700 --> 06:22.600
When was that?

06:23.366 --> 06:24.800
About three hours ago, sir.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.666
Why didn't you listen to my order
to eliminate them earlier?

06:46.033 --> 06:46.933
I am sorry.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.366
I was going to deal
with them on the D-day.

06:50.233 --> 06:51.300
Eliminate them quickly

06:51.900 --> 06:53.200
and move your hideout as well.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.800
Yes, sir.

07:07.033 --> 07:07.900
By any chance,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.800
do you have a hotline with the Chairman
of the National Defense Commission?

07:16.833 --> 07:18.800
Exploding a nuclear bomb
in the middle of Seoul

07:19.966 --> 07:22.133
is more than just a terrorist attack.

07:22.433 --> 07:23.500
You should remember

07:23.666 --> 07:26.733
that it will lead to an all-out war
between South and North Korea.

07:27.833 --> 07:28.733
In addition...

07:29.900 --> 07:30.833
It's urgent to find out

07:30.900 --> 07:32.800
how much the North Korean military
supports the plan

07:33.233 --> 07:35.866
and how much the Chairman
of the National Defense Commission knows

07:36.966 --> 07:38.466
about this situation.

07:39.366 --> 07:40.833
We also need to find out

07:41.633 --> 07:43.566
what Gi-hoon Yeon's plan is
after the nuclear attack.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.000
Depending on your judgment and decision,

07:48.500 --> 07:50.633
we may stop the war.

07:51.466 --> 07:52.833
Please keep that in mind.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.266
He's looking for you.

09:01.233 --> 09:02.466
I'm not sure

09:03.333 --> 09:04.466
what to do.

09:06.566 --> 09:09.933
Shouldn't we arrest San Baek
and Gi-hoon Yeon now

09:10.266 --> 09:11.866
to stop the bomb?

09:12.333 --> 09:13.366
Even if we arrest them,

09:13.933 --> 09:15.566
it would be difficult to locate the bomb.

09:27.566 --> 09:28.766
Come to think of it,

09:30.633 --> 09:34.300
I had plenty of time to notice
that I was being used.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.700
Reinstated so quickly
after I had failed to protect

09:38.266 --> 09:39.900
Comrade Seong-cheol Yun.

09:41.466 --> 09:43.500
It's impossible in my country.

09:44.266 --> 09:47.533
Yet, never once did I never suspect
Comrade Gi-hoon Yeon.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.866
I thought

09:51.366 --> 09:52.800
what kept me blind were

09:54.133 --> 09:56.433
my loyalty to our country
and trust for our people.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.866
It hurts to know

10:02.366 --> 10:03.866
that I finally realized today

10:06.133 --> 10:07.600
it's all because of my own ambition.

10:08.133 --> 10:09.666
It's not too late.

10:11.866 --> 10:13.400
We must find the nuclear bomb quickly

10:15.000 --> 10:16.566
and prevent a war between North and South.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.033
Do-chul Kang will probably try to kill

10:19.100 --> 10:21.366
you and Hyun-jun Kim
before he starts his plan.

10:27.033 --> 10:29.000
There's no way for me
to locate the bomb either.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.133
By now

10:31.966 --> 10:34.200
the enriched uranium and the detonator
may have been combined

10:34.433 --> 10:36.466
and installed in the explosion site.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.766
And now the only ones who can find it

10:41.533 --> 10:43.266
are you and Hyun-jun.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.533
We are here.

11:07.766 --> 11:09.233
The tracking service can lead us

11:09.333 --> 11:10.266
only up to here.

11:18.533 --> 11:19.500
What are you going to do?

11:19.566 --> 11:21.500
I was captured
in the engine room of a building.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.466
It must be one of these buildings.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.433
It's too dangerous to look for it alone.

11:25.633 --> 11:27.900
Let's report to Secretary Park
and ask for backup.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
You do that.

11:30.800 --> 11:31.666
Seung-hee Choi!

11:32.366 --> 11:33.400
Keep your line open.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.566
ENGINE ROOM

12:54.400 --> 12:56.166
She's around here. Find her quickly.

13:08.900 --> 13:09.766
I'm sorry.

13:10.066 --> 13:11.200
I couldn't stop her.

13:11.466 --> 13:12.666
Wait where you are at.

13:13.133 --> 13:14.466
I'll send the SWAT right away

13:14.900 --> 13:15.800
and to Seung-hee--

13:18.533 --> 13:19.533
What the heck are you doing?

13:19.733 --> 13:21.000
You are being arrested for treason.

13:21.633 --> 13:22.600
Sir.

13:23.800 --> 13:24.700
Sir!

13:24.766 --> 13:25.766
Treason?

13:26.433 --> 13:27.466
What treason?

13:28.233 --> 13:29.233
Take him.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.866
Let go of me, you bastards!

13:32.633 --> 13:34.633
Whose order is this? Director Baek's?

13:36.466 --> 13:37.666
Shut up and just follow quietly.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.066
Seung-hee.

14:09.133 --> 14:10.066
There's a problem.

14:10.866 --> 14:11.766
What's wrong?

14:11.866 --> 14:13.200
Secretary Park seems to be arrested.

14:13.833 --> 14:14.700
Ma'am.

14:16.866 --> 14:17.733
Seung-hee.

14:18.466 --> 14:19.333
Seung-hee.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.366
Ma'am,

14:20.966 --> 14:22.300
you are currently under suspension.

14:22.900 --> 14:23.966
Please come with us.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.033
If you do not cooperate,
I'll have to arrest you.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.100
I'm tracking down the terrorists now.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.133
You should call for backup.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.466
I told you, you are under suspension.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.466
We found Ms. Choi Seung-hee.
Come to the front of Hana Building.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.666
Why are you doing this?

14:45.233 --> 14:46.666
I am protecting you, ma'am.

14:46.733 --> 14:48.600
No, tell me the real reason.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.400
Sa-woo, are you trying
to protect me, or the terrorists?

14:52.033 --> 14:53.266
What are you saying now?

14:53.333 --> 14:55.566
The list of asbestos factories
from Tae-sung.

14:55.966 --> 14:58.366
Why did you skip Anyang warehouse,
the terrorists' hideout?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.300
I...

15:02.166 --> 15:03.233
I didn't do that.

15:04.433 --> 15:06.633
Do you know
how suspicious you are recently?

15:07.333 --> 15:08.633
What made you change like this?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.100
It's not me that's changed. It's you.

15:10.966 --> 15:12.966
Why are you throwing caution to the wind?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.000
Stop being obsessed with Hyun-jun.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.366
Hyun-jun put you in danger
and made you unhappy.

15:17.633 --> 15:20.166
He's just a bad memory
that you have to erase.

15:21.766 --> 15:22.733
So right now,

15:23.566 --> 15:24.766
I'm trying to correct it.

15:28.533 --> 15:30.300
Arrest Ms. Choi right now.

15:30.566 --> 15:31.433
Take her!

15:33.800 --> 15:36.633
Let me go. It's not me. It's Sa-woo Jin
who should be taken!

15:37.000 --> 15:37.900
Let go of me!

15:38.366 --> 15:39.233
Hurry!

15:51.866 --> 15:52.900
Hey, we have a big problem.

15:52.966 --> 15:54.933
I don't know what it is,
but can't you tell me later?

15:55.000 --> 15:55.866
I'm really busy now.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.633
Something really big happened.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.666
What is it?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.466
Secretary Park was arrested.

16:04.700 --> 16:07.000
-What are you talking about now?
-I don't know.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.233
The security agents took him away.

16:11.233 --> 16:12.066
Damn...

16:26.866 --> 16:29.033
Comrade Gi-hoon Yeon has been
looking for you.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.500
I think he was suspecting you.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.066
There's nothing to worry about.

16:38.133 --> 16:39.433
Commissioner Yeon wants you.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.800
You're often outside.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.733
I checked out the route
going back to our country.

16:50.700 --> 16:51.600
What do you mean?

16:53.400 --> 16:54.600
I believe my first mission is

16:55.666 --> 16:57.800
to guide and protect you, sir.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.666
In case things go wrong,

17:01.366 --> 17:04.066
shouldn't we plan to escape
from South Korea beforehand?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.166
When are we going back to our country?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.433
Shall we take a look at Seoul?

17:27.333 --> 17:29.166
Captain Ho-sang Choi
of Pyeongyang Defense Command,

17:29.233 --> 17:31.233
Captain Taek-soo Jung
of the Fourth Division,

17:31.566 --> 17:33.733
and Vice-marshal Tae-joon Rhee
of Defense Security Command

17:34.366 --> 17:35.600
are in the same boat with me.

17:37.066 --> 17:40.400
All of us are deeply dissatisfied
with Comrade Chairman's policies.

17:41.933 --> 17:43.133
After the nuclear bomb sets off,

17:44.066 --> 17:46.466
Vice-marshal Tae-joon Rhee will take over

17:46.533 --> 17:49.533
Haebangsandong commissioner's office
in Pyeongyang.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.200
At the same time,

17:52.066 --> 17:54.400
he'll capture the Comrade Chairman.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.733
In the meantime,
the Fourth Division will siege

17:58.666 --> 18:00.466
the perimeter of Pyeongyang.

18:01.066 --> 18:02.100
Should it happen,

18:02.633 --> 18:05.400
the US forces in South Korea will
attack our country, making it a total war.

18:05.766 --> 18:06.800
It will be proclaimed

18:07.266 --> 18:09.133
that the nuclear terrorist attack
was carried out

18:09.666 --> 18:13.333
solely by Light Infantry Guide Bureau
under the secret order of the Chairman.

18:13.666 --> 18:15.133
Light Infantry Guide Bureau?

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
The Eighth Division.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.566
The U.S. Pacific Fleet will hit

18:21.633 --> 18:23.866
the 25 missile bases
including Musudanri, Dongchangri,

18:24.466 --> 18:27.400
and Kittaeryong in our country.

18:27.933 --> 18:31.400
However, instead of a counterattack,
we'll suppress the Eighth Division,

18:31.466 --> 18:35.033
known to have led the nuclear terrorist
attack to the outside world,

18:35.100 --> 18:36.666
and file a request for the UN mediation.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.700
Then...

18:39.133 --> 18:41.433
The truce between the North
and the South will be reestablished

18:41.700 --> 18:44.666
and as Tae-joon Rhee administration
opens a new era in the DPRK,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.733
our revolution will succeed in the end.

19:00.066 --> 19:01.166
Block the tapping.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.200
Yes, sir.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.733
All right, I'll let him know.

19:29.233 --> 19:31.000
Chul-young Park called me.

19:31.433 --> 19:32.366
What did he say?

19:32.766 --> 19:35.333
He said some military cliques
are also involved.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.433
Immediately after the nuclear attack,

19:39.100 --> 19:41.800
they plan to arrest and detain
Chairman Jung-il Kim.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.933
You mean a coup?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.300
Yes.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.333
In regard to the reason
why the NSS exists,

19:58.733 --> 20:00.600
please think it over again.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.200
Mr. President,

20:04.166 --> 20:06.233
It's our mission and raison d'etre

20:07.500 --> 20:09.200
to help you achieve your goals

20:10.033 --> 20:12.200
for our country

20:14.233 --> 20:17.000
without any problem or obstacles.

20:18.633 --> 20:20.533
There is a so-called Iris group.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.100
And there's a resistance group
against them.

20:26.733 --> 20:30.733
Iris exerts influence on both Koreas,

20:32.600 --> 20:36.166
and the NSS Director Baek is also
receiving orders from them.

20:37.466 --> 20:38.433
Is that right?

20:39.600 --> 20:40.533
Yes, sir.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.200
The nuclear threat must have been designed

20:45.400 --> 20:48.700
by those who are opposed to the summit.

20:49.366 --> 20:51.800
Your desire for reunification

20:51.866 --> 20:53.266
and change of regime in North Korea.

20:54.166 --> 20:56.600
These must be unwelcome factors

20:57.366 --> 21:00.733
for those who don't want
the Korean reunification.

21:01.633 --> 21:02.666
Who are they?

21:03.333 --> 21:04.233
Excuse me?

21:09.566 --> 21:11.400
While I was preparing for the summit

21:11.700 --> 21:13.766
without the NSS,

21:15.033 --> 21:16.600
I've thought a lot.

21:17.266 --> 21:19.266
I told you that I entrusted the NSS

21:19.466 --> 21:22.933
with the preparations
for the summit, right?

21:24.300 --> 21:25.300
Yes.

21:25.366 --> 21:28.900
But something must be done
before that happens.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.200
The current NSS is not acceptable.

21:32.933 --> 21:35.266
They work in the darkness
and let nobody know about them,

21:35.566 --> 21:37.300
but I can't accept

21:38.200 --> 21:39.700
such a secret organization.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.700
So what you mean is...

21:42.766 --> 21:46.100
The previous administrations may
have needed such a secret agency,

21:46.966 --> 21:48.400
but in my term,

21:49.066 --> 21:51.333
I won't accept such agency.

21:52.066 --> 21:53.700
The NSS will officially become

21:53.766 --> 21:56.133
a national intelligence agency.

21:56.700 --> 21:59.700
And for the first director of the new NSS,

22:00.433 --> 22:02.666
incumbent Deputy Director San Baek
will be appointed.

22:03.066 --> 22:05.133
As soon as Deputy Director Baek
comes back from Hungary,

22:05.333 --> 22:06.700
appoint him as the director.

22:08.666 --> 22:09.633
Yes, sir.

22:17.066 --> 22:19.700
I told the President everything.

22:20.566 --> 22:22.900
All right, let's talk later again.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.333
It's all my fault.

22:30.233 --> 22:32.033
Not knowing who San Baek really was,

22:33.366 --> 22:35.500
I've appointed him as head of the NSS.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.966
No, sir.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.666
It's my responsibility
since I couldn't serve you better.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.600
We must make a thorough investigation

22:43.233 --> 22:44.733
on San Baek's Iris

22:44.933 --> 22:48.200
and reveal their identity and schemes.

22:49.066 --> 22:50.000
I understand.

22:50.933 --> 22:52.066
I'll do my best

22:52.366 --> 22:53.800
to find out

22:54.000 --> 22:55.800
who infiltrated the government agencies

22:56.200 --> 22:57.666
as well as the Blue House.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.700
We're at the front.

23:23.766 --> 23:24.800
We'll be up soon.

23:59.466 --> 24:02.266
Right, go to the security room
and ask for cooperation.

24:02.633 --> 24:03.533
Yes, sir.

24:48.933 --> 24:50.000
Drop your gun.

24:59.700 --> 25:00.600
Turn around.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.433
I'm in the engine room...

25:24.700 --> 25:25.866
Director Baek and you.

25:28.133 --> 25:29.066
Since when?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.333
Why do you want to know?

25:34.133 --> 25:35.433
I suffered enough as well.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.233
Just end this quickly.

25:38.766 --> 25:39.933
Until I get to know everything,

25:42.666 --> 25:44.133
you can't die even if you wanted to.

25:49.333 --> 25:50.300
Tell me, now.

25:51.766 --> 25:52.700
When did it start?

25:53.700 --> 25:55.333
When you pointed a gun at me in Hungary,

25:57.966 --> 25:59.033
what were you?

26:03.300 --> 26:04.233
Iris?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.133
Or my friend?

26:55.766 --> 26:56.666
Sa-woo Jin!

27:04.066 --> 27:06.300
Hey, you coward. You ran away alone?

27:06.766 --> 27:08.300
Calm down, man.

27:12.666 --> 27:14.066
You were with somebody, right?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.100
I might kill you.

27:16.666 --> 27:17.566
Seung-hee.

27:30.333 --> 27:31.300
Sa-woo!

27:32.033 --> 27:33.266
You're listening to me, right?

27:34.800 --> 27:35.966
For the past two years,

27:37.133 --> 27:38.600
whenever I thought of you,

27:39.233 --> 27:40.733
my conclusion was always the same.

27:41.633 --> 27:43.133
He did it because it's Sa-woo Jin.

27:44.166 --> 27:48.300
Always sticking to the principles,
following orders, no matter what.

27:48.966 --> 27:50.066
That's you, Sa-woo Jin!

27:51.400 --> 27:53.033
That's why I thought it was possible.

27:54.633 --> 27:56.266
When he was asked to kill me,

27:57.533 --> 27:59.066
what would he have felt?

27:59.766 --> 28:01.800
I didn't blame you.

28:02.233 --> 28:03.833
I blamed San Baek and the NSS

28:06.266 --> 28:08.400
that gave you the order.

28:09.133 --> 28:10.366
And I sought revenge.

28:11.933 --> 28:13.000
Sa-woo! I never thought

28:15.533 --> 28:16.700
you would be part of Iris--

28:16.866 --> 28:18.000
You were always like this!

28:19.133 --> 28:20.666
You know nothing about me.

28:22.066 --> 28:23.066
You hardly noticed

28:23.833 --> 28:25.533
how much I got hurt,

28:26.666 --> 28:27.566
because of you,

28:28.133 --> 28:29.800
and what I had to give up,

28:30.666 --> 28:32.166
because of you.

28:34.533 --> 28:36.400
What's the use of knowing
when it all started?

28:38.566 --> 28:40.766
What meaning would it have now?

28:43.566 --> 28:45.200
I was going to kill you!

28:46.200 --> 28:47.233
At that moment,

28:48.733 --> 28:50.066
you didn't exist

28:51.566 --> 28:52.600
in my heart!

28:54.933 --> 28:55.800
Sa-woo...

29:55.233 --> 29:56.633
It's still not too late, Sa-woo.

29:57.766 --> 29:58.900
You have time to rectify

30:00.866 --> 30:01.900
all of your wrongdoings.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.033
Shut up!

30:03.733 --> 30:04.966
The only way to rectify them is

30:05.600 --> 30:06.900
to make you disappear.

30:29.300 --> 30:30.166
He's outside.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.400
Do-chul Kang and his men.

30:40.033 --> 30:41.133
They are all gone.

30:53.433 --> 30:55.400
I think they were trying to kill us
before taking off.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.166
What should we do now?

31:17.233 --> 31:18.133
Hyun-jun!

31:20.966 --> 31:22.000
He's still alive.

31:23.833 --> 31:25.766
Wake up! Wake up!

31:27.800 --> 31:28.733
Help me.

31:35.566 --> 31:36.500
Where's the doctor?

31:45.800 --> 31:46.633
Gosh!

31:46.700 --> 31:47.833
What kind of accident was it?

31:50.600 --> 31:52.433
Wake up. Wake up!

31:52.500 --> 31:53.400
Wake up!

31:53.466 --> 31:54.566
Looks like a gunshot wound.

31:54.733 --> 31:56.400
Shouldn't we report this first?

32:01.800 --> 32:02.700
Oh...

32:03.433 --> 32:04.400
Even for a few seconds

32:04.966 --> 32:06.033
make him conscious.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.033
Hurry!

32:24.266 --> 32:25.633
Wake up. Wake up.

32:25.966 --> 32:27.333
Wake up. Wake up!

32:28.033 --> 32:29.066
Open your eyes.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.300
Where is Do-chul Kang?

32:34.600 --> 32:35.633
Where is Do-chul Kang?

32:37.266 --> 32:38.433
Where is the contact point?

32:39.533 --> 32:40.533
I don't know.

32:41.166 --> 32:42.300
Listen to me carefully.

32:43.333 --> 32:44.366
You're going to die anyway.

32:45.866 --> 32:47.466
If you wish your pain would end quickly,

32:48.200 --> 32:50.300
-answer me.
-It's already too late.

32:51.066 --> 32:51.933
You...

32:52.366 --> 32:53.500
You can't stop us.

32:58.666 --> 33:00.700
Wake up, wake up!

33:01.833 --> 33:02.766
Inject more atropine.

33:03.266 --> 33:06.100
It's too late. I can't do it anymore.

33:25.966 --> 33:26.866
Did you find out?

33:39.166 --> 33:40.033
Disappeared?

33:40.566 --> 33:41.433
To where?

33:41.666 --> 33:42.533
I don't know.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.966
Three guys remained behind
to do away with Sun-hwa and me.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.266
There's no movement yet on this side.

33:50.333 --> 33:51.500
Until Gi-hoon Yeon leaves,

33:52.333 --> 33:53.666
they won't set off the bomb.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.333
Don't tell Mr. Hyung-jun Jung

33:55.533 --> 33:56.866
that we missed Do-chul Kang.

33:57.633 --> 33:58.800
If he finds out,

33:59.633 --> 34:01.166
the President won't wait any longer.

34:02.266 --> 34:04.466
He'll probably try to interrogate
Gi-hoon Yeon and San Baek.

34:05.066 --> 34:06.100
In that way,

34:06.466 --> 34:07.766
we can't stop the nuclear explosion.

34:08.533 --> 34:10.066
I'll track them down from here.

34:10.766 --> 34:12.866
When Gi-hoon Yeon starts to move,
let me know immediately.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.566
What are you going to do?

34:21.166 --> 34:22.900
This belonged to the guy
who died at the clinic.

34:35.333 --> 34:36.666
STOP

37:41.866 --> 37:43.366
Mr. Hyung-jun Jung is acting weird.

37:43.966 --> 37:45.066
Weird? How?

37:45.600 --> 37:47.066
He's intentionally leaving me out

37:47.300 --> 37:49.466
and privately talks with the President
more and more often.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.633
Didn't he get the wind of anything?

37:53.566 --> 37:55.000
Once the operation starts,

37:56.200 --> 37:58.366
we'll take over the Blue House as well.

37:58.866 --> 38:01.833
How far does the headquarters
think we can go?

38:02.900 --> 38:05.433
The change of regime in both
South and North Korea.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.000
Depending on the situation,

38:07.633 --> 38:09.766
you may have to get rid of the President.

38:11.533 --> 38:14.166
Keep an eye on the President
and Mr. Hyung-jun Jung

38:14.833 --> 38:16.866
and call me immediately
if there's anything particular.

38:49.300 --> 38:50.633
By inciting Seung-hee Choi,

38:52.333 --> 38:53.633
what were you going to do?

38:56.166 --> 38:57.566
What I know so far are...

38:59.333 --> 39:00.900
that Hyun-jun Kim is alive,

39:02.566 --> 39:04.266
that we need to stop
the nuclear terrorism,

39:05.833 --> 39:08.966
and that there's a mole in the NSS.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.233
These three things.

39:13.000 --> 39:13.966
You said a mole.

39:14.966 --> 39:16.833
Betraying whom?

39:19.733 --> 39:21.466
You really don't know?

39:21.566 --> 39:24.466
What I'm going to do is
for our country's interests and security.

39:24.533 --> 39:25.833
You mean the nuclear terrorism?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.200
What kind of national interest...

39:30.166 --> 39:31.933
demands 150,000 lives?

39:35.766 --> 39:38.433
People are prone to forget the reality

39:38.566 --> 39:40.466
that we are in a state of armistice.

39:41.533 --> 39:42.900
With the sacrifice of 150,000 lives,

39:42.966 --> 39:45.633
we could restore a sense of security,
and protect this country.

39:45.933 --> 39:47.500
Not a bad deal, isn't it?

39:51.500 --> 39:52.600
Who are you, really?

39:53.933 --> 39:56.133
You'll get to know soon.

40:05.633 --> 40:06.566
Speak.

40:06.633 --> 40:07.800
We lost

40:07.966 --> 40:08.933
Ms. Seung-hee Choi.

40:09.766 --> 40:10.666
What?

40:15.966 --> 40:16.866
Where is Seung-hee Choi?

40:17.200 --> 40:18.266
On the way here,

40:19.766 --> 40:20.766
they lost her.

40:21.533 --> 40:23.366
The SWAT is pursuing her.

40:25.466 --> 40:27.133
Our operation will start soon.

40:28.733 --> 40:29.733
Find her quickly beforehand.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.466
Ms. Choi escaped

41:07.233 --> 41:09.733
while being transferred to the NSS.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.066
If I can't find her first,
she'll be in danger.

41:15.266 --> 41:16.466
If you have any idea

41:17.866 --> 41:19.466
where Seung-hee Choi could be, tell me.

41:20.966 --> 41:21.900
Sa-woo...

41:22.966 --> 41:24.166
Why are you doing this?

41:27.366 --> 41:29.000
What in the world are you planning?

41:30.633 --> 41:31.866
Director Baek and you.

41:32.866 --> 41:33.800
What's your relationship?

41:38.266 --> 41:39.366
You'd better not know.

41:40.266 --> 41:41.200
If you knew...

41:43.500 --> 41:44.900
You'd be in danger as well.

41:45.633 --> 41:46.600
Danger?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.833
I'm detained here for treason.

41:51.333 --> 41:53.000
What else would I fear?

41:54.033 --> 41:56.833
You know what really scares me?

41:57.500 --> 41:58.566
That I...

41:59.100 --> 42:01.133
dragged you into the NSS.

42:01.866 --> 42:03.366
I've always thought of you more

42:04.866 --> 42:07.700
-as a brother than a hometown kid.--
-Please stop.

42:07.766 --> 42:08.766
Tell me.

42:10.800 --> 42:11.866
Why are you doing this?

42:13.600 --> 42:14.533
Director Baek has...

42:15.866 --> 42:17.133
something on you?

42:17.800 --> 42:18.733
Please stop.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.466
Do you think I would change

42:23.033 --> 42:24.333
just because he got something on me?

42:24.900 --> 42:27.000
I'm asking because I know you wouldn't!

42:28.500 --> 42:29.433
What's the matter?

42:31.100 --> 42:32.100
For whom and for what

42:32.633 --> 42:33.866
are you doing this?

42:40.866 --> 42:42.300
I fully understand

42:43.366 --> 42:44.466
how much you're suffering

42:45.600 --> 42:46.800
right now.

42:49.666 --> 42:50.600
Sa-woo.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.533
You're doing something

42:53.900 --> 42:55.866
that's just not you.

43:19.766 --> 43:20.866
Oh!

43:33.366 --> 43:35.300
Have you seen agent Mi-jeong Yang
by any chance?

43:36.066 --> 43:37.133
Mi-jeong?

43:37.566 --> 43:38.500
I have no idea.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.900
What? You have something else
to talk about?

43:52.766 --> 43:54.300
No, thank you for your cooperation.

44:09.900 --> 44:10.833
He left.

44:11.133 --> 44:12.100
You may get up.

44:15.766 --> 44:16.700
What should we do now?

44:17.800 --> 44:18.766
First of all,

44:19.466 --> 44:20.666
let's contact Seung-hee.

44:21.066 --> 44:24.533
I've been trying, but neither Ms. Yang
nor Ms. Choi would answer.

44:41.933 --> 44:43.200
What you requested is in there.

44:49.566 --> 44:50.600
Thanks.

44:52.166 --> 44:54.566
You can't get
Secretary Park's help anymore.

44:56.333 --> 44:57.266
What are you going to do?

45:38.433 --> 45:39.700
DESTINATION LIST

45:43.566 --> 45:44.900
I couldn't find any clues.

45:45.400 --> 45:46.366
Did you find anything?

45:46.600 --> 45:49.300
It's the list of destinations recorded
in this car for the past week.

45:56.500 --> 45:57.633
Look at these dates.

45:58.566 --> 46:00.833
They wandered around all these places
for the past three days.

46:02.700 --> 46:03.833
Why do you think they did so?

46:10.200 --> 46:11.233
We'll see when we get there.

46:24.366 --> 46:25.233
Pull over please.

46:34.433 --> 46:35.600
You can contact Mi-jeong, right?

46:36.466 --> 46:37.300
Yes.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.100
SEUNG-HEE CHOI, COUNTER-TERRORISM DIVISION

46:41.333 --> 46:43.733
Well...

46:43.800 --> 46:45.733
Scanning the radioactive level
with the satellite is

46:45.800 --> 46:46.966
of course possible,

46:47.566 --> 46:49.566
but we still can't locate
this nuclear bomb.

46:49.966 --> 46:50.800
Why?

46:50.866 --> 46:53.966
First of all, the detonator
that they stole from the NSS

46:54.166 --> 46:56.200
blocks the radioactivity completely,

46:56.266 --> 46:57.433
so we can't detect it.

46:57.500 --> 46:58.566
And?

46:58.633 --> 47:01.900
Then what's left is
the enriched uranium sphere.

47:02.733 --> 47:05.533
But if they brought
the enriched uranium sphere here,

47:06.200 --> 47:09.300
the first thing they would've considered
must be controlling its radioactivity.

47:09.866 --> 47:11.166
If that's the case,

47:11.533 --> 47:12.933
we can't scan for it, either.

47:13.100 --> 47:13.966
If they made a bomb

47:14.033 --> 47:16.566
by combining the detonator
and the enriched uranium sphere,

47:17.200 --> 47:20.166
the radioactivity must've been emitted
during the working process.

47:20.800 --> 47:21.700
Okay.

47:21.766 --> 47:23.066
It's possible.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.233
Mi-jeong, can you connect
to the satellite now?

47:25.300 --> 47:26.133
Yes, I can.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.400
Then, please find out the areas

47:27.466 --> 47:30.066
where the level of radioactivity changed
in Seoul during the past week.

47:30.500 --> 47:31.333
I got it.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.600
Sir, please teach Mi-jeong

47:32.666 --> 47:35.666
what variables she should consider
in analyzing the satellite data.

47:36.066 --> 47:37.066
Okay, I got it.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.100
SEOUL CITY TOUR DOUBLE-DECKER BUS

48:03.400 --> 48:04.466
SEOUL MUSEUM OF HISTORY

48:06.066 --> 48:07.200
HONGHWAMUN

48:56.266 --> 48:57.100
Sir!

48:57.166 --> 48:58.100
Ah... huh?

48:59.333 --> 49:00.233
What it is?

49:00.300 --> 49:01.933
It's all done. We'll see the results soon.

49:02.000 --> 49:02.866
Oh, really?

49:09.133 --> 49:10.133
What are you doing?

49:11.900 --> 49:14.800
Don't you know using the satellite
without permission is against the rules?

49:27.433 --> 49:28.333
Follow me.

49:46.433 --> 49:48.266
You know how things are
around the NSS right now.

49:48.866 --> 49:52.333
Do you want to get arrested
like Secretary Sang-hyun Park?

49:52.666 --> 49:54.433
Ms. Choi ordered you that, right?

49:56.333 --> 49:57.200
Yes.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.733
What does she want?

49:59.433 --> 50:02.833
She asked me to check the areas
where the level of radioactivity changed.

50:04.133 --> 50:06.866
And if you send her the results,
Ms. Choi will be there?

50:09.133 --> 50:10.033
Yes.

50:14.233 --> 50:16.900
Send the results to Ms. Choi.

50:27.666 --> 50:30.100
Seoul Guro Sugung 7 Street 137

50:30.800 --> 50:31.800
We got the results.

50:34.400 --> 50:35.600
Let me go alone from here.

50:36.366 --> 50:37.366
Seung-hee.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.966
I'll call you when I need your help.

50:49.366 --> 50:50.333
Thanks.

50:50.700 --> 50:51.633
Be careful.

51:08.966 --> 51:11.400
I located Ms. Choi.

51:12.766 --> 51:13.733
Good.

51:14.300 --> 51:16.366
Send me her location
and dispatch the agents.

51:24.200 --> 51:26.566
DAEHANMUN

51:26.700 --> 51:28.266
I don't think it's going to work this way.

51:29.966 --> 51:32.000
Except that they're all close
to Seoul downtown,

51:32.666 --> 51:33.900
they have nothing in common.

51:34.766 --> 51:36.966
Were they looking for the explosion site?

51:38.066 --> 51:39.100
I don't think so.

51:40.333 --> 51:43.133
When they planned the terrorist attack,
I think they already chose the target.

51:43.866 --> 51:45.533
Give me the list of recent destinations.

51:50.300 --> 51:52.700
We already checked all the places
where they repeatedly went

51:52.766 --> 51:53.700
for the past three days.

51:56.133 --> 51:57.166
Take a look here.

51:58.600 --> 51:59.900
They went to this place only once.

52:01.466 --> 52:02.600
Unlike other places,

52:04.000 --> 52:05.300
it's not in downtown Seoul either.

52:07.533 --> 52:09.833
Seoul Guro Sugung 7 Street 137

52:10.466 --> 52:11.500
Why did they go there?

52:16.900 --> 52:17.733
Hey!

52:17.966 --> 52:19.666
Haven't you seen Secretary Park?

52:20.266 --> 52:21.600
I can't reach him.

52:21.666 --> 52:22.533
You know...

52:24.233 --> 52:25.166
What's the matter?

52:27.133 --> 52:28.533
Secretary Park was arrested.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.033
What are you talking about?

52:30.633 --> 52:31.566
Why?

52:31.633 --> 52:33.500
I don't know well,
but they said a treason.

52:33.733 --> 52:34.633
Treason?

52:48.400 --> 52:49.266
It's me.

52:51.333 --> 52:52.466
Treason?

52:53.433 --> 52:55.100
What act of treason?

52:56.933 --> 52:57.866
Yes.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.100
Pardon?

53:10.800 --> 53:13.133
The NSS is... suspicious.

53:14.533 --> 53:16.366
What are you talking about?

53:16.700 --> 53:18.666
The Secretary of the NSS
Counter-terrorism Division is

53:19.533 --> 53:21.166
arrested for treason.

53:22.533 --> 53:23.533
Did you know?

53:24.300 --> 53:26.666
No, I wasn't informed.

53:27.300 --> 53:28.633
How did you know

53:29.200 --> 53:30.433
what happened inside the NSS?

53:30.800 --> 53:31.800
I am...

53:32.300 --> 53:33.600
the Head of National Security.

53:34.033 --> 53:36.100
Did you think I have
no intelligence capability at all?

53:38.400 --> 53:42.166
Right now, we have an emergency situation
to stop a nuclear attack

53:42.633 --> 53:44.533
and don't you think what's going on
inside the NSS

53:45.066 --> 53:45.966
is quite serious?

53:46.733 --> 53:47.933
We need to take measures quickly.

53:54.433 --> 53:55.333
What's the matter?

53:56.266 --> 53:57.166
All right.

53:58.400 --> 53:59.900
I have an emergency,

54:00.066 --> 54:01.633
so I'll have to excuse myself first.

54:18.366 --> 54:21.266
There was a shooting incident
in a downtown clinic this afternoon.

54:28.700 --> 54:31.300
I asked the police
not to disclose this incident.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.600
I have to meet the doctor

54:34.000 --> 54:35.433
and talk to him personally.

54:35.666 --> 54:36.633
I understand.

54:55.666 --> 54:57.500
The person you called is not available...

55:03.166 --> 55:04.333
He asked me

55:04.866 --> 55:06.966
to revive the dying guy
even for a short time,

55:07.566 --> 55:09.133
and asked him where Do-chul Kang was.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.300
Did he answer?

55:10.666 --> 55:11.566
No.

55:12.633 --> 55:13.966
He didn't say anything

55:14.866 --> 55:15.766
and died in the end.

55:20.233 --> 55:22.566
I think Hyun-jun Kim lost the terrorists.

55:24.133 --> 55:26.366
If he lost the terrorists,

55:27.333 --> 55:29.800
there's no way we can locate
the nuclear bomb's whereabouts.

55:30.633 --> 55:32.466
Where is Hyun-jun Kim now?

55:32.733 --> 55:33.933
I can't reach him.

55:34.333 --> 55:37.100
It's only Gi-hoon Yeon
that knows the whereabouts

55:37.333 --> 55:38.800
of the terrorists and the nuclear bomb.

55:39.833 --> 55:40.733
Yes, sir.

55:40.800 --> 55:43.733
Find Gi-hoon Yeon right now.

55:44.266 --> 55:45.600
Are you telling me to arrest him?

55:45.666 --> 55:48.166
We can't just expect Hyun-jun Kim
to do something anymore.

55:49.166 --> 55:52.466
We must stop
the nuclear attack at any cost.

55:52.533 --> 55:54.500
-Move quickly.
-Yes, sir.

57:38.566 --> 57:41.200
They seem to have combined the detonator
and the enriched uranium here.

59:00.833 --> 59:03.033
Where were you going to set off the bomb?

59:10.433 --> 59:11.500
We'll go to Gwanghwamun

59:12.200 --> 59:13.166
and explode it directly.

59:20.900 --> 59:22.000
They said it's Gwanghwamun.

59:28.333 --> 59:29.433
We stop them right here.
