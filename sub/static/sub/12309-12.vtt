WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:03.471
Previously on Stargate Atlantis.

00:03.880 --> 00:04.915
What is it?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.276
Something that will one day make us
completely immune to the Wraith.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.396
We want to test the serum's effectiveness
against your prisoner.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.916
We're talking about putting a human being
in the same room as a starving Wraith.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.312
The test subject is a terminally ill patient
who has volunteered himself.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.553
What have you done to me?

00:21.640 --> 00:23.517
Now, we've been tracking
what appears to be a new sickness

00:23.600 --> 00:24.749
in the Pegasus Galaxy.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.799
It's a unique protein originally created
by the inhabitants of a planet called Hoff.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.235
It was designed to interfere
with the Wraith's feeding mechanism,

00:31.320 --> 00:32.639
making them immune to the process.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.154
It also killed the feeding Wraith
and half the people who took it.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.229
Well, let's not forget that Michael
spread the modified Hoffan drug

00:39.320 --> 00:42.357
to dozens of worlds, possibly more.
I mean, no one knows for sure, right?

00:42.440 --> 00:46.035
Which means that every time you feed,
you're taking a risk.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.920 --> 01:09.194
Once more.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.197
Bad news, I'm afraid.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.999
You'll have to go
back to school tomorrow.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.231
Maintain the amoxicillin
for three more days.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.639
That should do the trick.

01:25.720 --> 01:29.838
Now, what do we have over here?
All these dressings need to be changed.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.559
Do you mind going back to the storeroom
and getting some more bandages, please?

01:32.640 --> 01:33.629
- Yes, Doctor.
- Thank you.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.073
Besides that,
you're looking good, my friend.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.357
- Mail call.
- Colonel. What are you all doing here?

01:38.440 --> 01:39.759
Well, we heard you needed supplies,

01:39.840 --> 01:42.308
so we thought we'd come by
and see how you were doing.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.914
A hop, skip and a jump from the gate.
That's what you call that?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.513
Nice to see you too, Rodney.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.511
- How are you, Doctor?
- Well, thanks.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.160
I take it these are the antibiotics
I ordered?

01:51.240 --> 01:54.391
Dr. Keller gave you a whole whack
of them, so they should last for a while.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.119
- God, I wish that were true.
- What does that mean?

01:57.200 --> 01:58.792
Well, I've been dealing
with a number of infections

01:58.880 --> 02:01.838
from the Hoffan plague survivors.
I can barely keep on top of it.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.831
Survivors of the Hoffan plague here?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.831
This is not one of the planets
that Michael targeted.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.559
No, but many of these people
actually come from another planet, Balar.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.517
They managed to survive the plague,

02:10.600 --> 02:12.670
and just when they started
getting their pieces back together,

02:12.760 --> 02:15.399
the Wraith showed up,
tried to wipe them out.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.835
- We heard rumors about that.
- Well, the Wraith aren't too pleased

02:17.920 --> 02:20.514
to have whole populations out there
that are immune to their feeding.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.916
Just a handful of the Balarans survived.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.639
The locals were kind enough
to take them in.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.837
- Doctor?
- Novo. These are my friends from Atlantis.

02:28.920 --> 02:33.152
Colonel Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon
and Dr. Rodney McKay.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.391
This is Novo.
She's been helping me here in the clinic.

02:36.480 --> 02:40.598
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You, as well. I've heard a lot about you.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.113
Is he the one?

02:43.240 --> 02:46.516
- The one what?
- From all the funny stories.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.114
Right. Yeah, well, I hope you all
can stay here for dinner.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.113
I mean, the canteen's not fancy,
but they do serve up one heck of a stew

02:53.200 --> 02:55.316
made from a goat-like creature. Delicious.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.550
- "Goat-like"?
- I think it's a great idea.

02:57.640 --> 03:01.519
Gives us a chance to catch up
and relive all those funny stories.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.589
Aye.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.678
So how's life in the wilds of Pegasus?
You've gotta be missing Atlantis by now.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.557
- Surprisingly, no.
- Come on,

03:10.640 --> 03:14.315
the hot baths, a PlayStation, deodorant.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.556
I know it seems a wee bit rough,
but it's not, really.

03:18.640 --> 03:22.758
Wherever I go, people are kind to me.
I never want for a meal or a place to sleep.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.955
And to be honest with you,

03:24.040 --> 03:26.110
I'm really starting to feel like
I'm making a difference.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.634
- What is it?
- Wraith.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.238
I count nine of them.
We can take them.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.595
No. There's too many civilians.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.875
It does not appear
to be an ordinary culling.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.949
How do you figure that?

05:00.040 --> 05:02.235
Well, for one thing, there are no Darts,

05:02.400 --> 05:05.358
and they do not seem
to be attacking the villagers.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.918
Who among you speaks for the rest?

05:19.160 --> 05:22.550
I'm Elson, leader of this village.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.831
What do you want with us?

05:27.920 --> 05:32.311
You've recently taken in
a group of refugees from another planet.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.868
They are survivors of a plague.

05:34.960 --> 05:39.317
It's important that you turn them
over to me immediately.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.870
- Why?
- The reasons why do not concern you.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.678
Provided you cooperate,

05:44.760 --> 05:47.752
you have my word
we will leave peacefully.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.317
And if we don't?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.714
That would be a very unwise decision.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.757
Our hive will be here
before the night is through.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.910
If you have not complied by then,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.357
I will give the word,
and your entire village will be destroyed.

06:13.360 --> 06:18.195
Turn over these outsiders,
and your lives will be spared.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.716
Resist, and you will all die together.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.475
The choice is yours.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.160
I don't understand.
They've already destroyed our homeworld.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.959
Why would they hunt
the rest of us down, as well?

06:45.040 --> 06:48.635
- You didn't tell them.
- Not the whole story.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.280
What are you talking about?

06:51.360 --> 06:54.750
Novo, remember when I told you that,
as a plague survivor,

06:54.840 --> 06:57.354
you'd be immune to the Wraith feeding?

06:57.440 --> 06:59.476
Well, there's a bit more to it than that.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.518
Any Wraith who tries to feed on you
or anyone like you

07:02.600 --> 07:05.194
will, as a result, die instantly.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.437
You're poison to them.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.233
- Then we're as good as dead.
- Not necessarily.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.276
They won't tolerate
our presence anywhere.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.679
Not if what you say is true.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.318
Just because they found you on this world

07:19.400 --> 07:21.709
does not mean that
there is nowhere you can hide.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.469
- Novo? Did you hear?
- Yes.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.471
This is Sefaris. He's also from Balar.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.152
The councilors are meeting to discuss

07:30.240 --> 07:32.151
whether or not
to heed the Wraith's request.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.595
- What? Where?
- The mine office.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.399
I tried to get in, but they turned me away.

07:37.480 --> 07:42.031
Ronon, Teyla, scope out the gate.
You two stay here, watch these people.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.917
Can you show me
where this mine office is?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.479
Yes.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.039
Colonel, what are you gonna
say to them?

07:47.120 --> 07:49.634
I'm gonna give them another way out.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.879
You're telling us that,
as a result of this plague,

07:53.960 --> 07:56.918
the Balarans are now deadly
to the Wraith?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.558
Pretty much.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.349
So the Wraith would never risk
culling this village.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.638
That's true, but that's also why

08:04.720 --> 08:07.154
they'd be willing
to wipe you guys out completely.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.595
A village that can't be culled
is no good to them.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.636
Did they know?
- What?

08:11.720 --> 08:13.950
Did the Balarans know
they were bringing this curse upon us

08:14.040 --> 08:15.792
- when they came here?
- No. They had no idea.

08:15.880 --> 08:20.476
- It's not their fault, Jervis.
- Maybe not, but that doesn't matter.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.549
The Wraith won't rest

08:21.640 --> 08:25.030
until every last plague survivor
in this galaxy is dead.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.633
Except the Wraith have no idea
who they are,

08:26.720 --> 08:29.518
unless people like you point them out.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.594
I'm not happy about this, either, Colonel,
but what other choice do we have?

08:34.679 --> 08:38.878
Well, we may be able
to move all your people

08:40.240 --> 08:42.799
to a different planet where they'll be safe.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.553
- You mean leave our homes?
- Look, I know it's not ideal,

08:45.640 --> 08:49.110
but the only other choice is to turn in
a bunch of innocent people,

08:49.200 --> 08:51.191
and I know you guys
aren't gonna do that, right?

08:51.280 --> 08:54.078
Well, as the Wraith said, they're outsiders.

08:54.160 --> 08:59.029
- Jervis, we agreed to let them come here.
- I didn't agree.

08:59.120 --> 09:03.955
Besides, they weren't a threat at the time.
Now that's changed.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.914
But they've become like family.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.753
Novo lives under my roof.
She eats at my table.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.150
My daughter adores her.
What am I supposed to tell her?

09:13.240 --> 09:16.073
You'd prefer that we all be killed?

09:16.400 --> 09:19.278
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
- Excuse me.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.349
Go ahead.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.669
Ronon and I are at the gate.
It does not appear to be heavily guarded.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.036
It's the same guys from the village.
I recognize the commander.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.755
What are the odds of you two
getting by them?

09:31.840 --> 09:34.832
- Pretty good.
- Slim, actually,

09:34.920 --> 09:36.638
but much better if you and Rodney join us.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.870
Yeah, all right.
Hold your position till we can get there.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.318
What is it?

09:43.400 --> 09:47.313
- How many people are in this village?
-600, 700.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.755
Well, we'll be tight for time,
but we can manage.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.831
- What are you suggesting?
We take the Wraith out,

09:51.920 --> 09:55.993
get everybody through the gate
before the hive ship comes.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.389
You should be safe in Atlantis
till we can relocate you.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.798
Unacceptable.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.112
The Balarans don't deserve this.
They did nothing but survive a sickness.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.192
It could just as easily
have happened to us.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.909
If we turn these people over, we are
no better than the Wraith ourselves.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.514
Look, even if you cooperate
with the Wraith,

10:16.600 --> 10:18.636
there's no guarantee
they're gonna keep their word.

10:18.720 --> 10:22.110
They may just kill all of you
for being an inconvenience.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.876
All right. What do you want us to do?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.918
Be ready to move.
Take only what you can carry.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.917
Let's go, Rodney.
We're gonna hit the Wraith.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.314
- We are?
- I'll come with you.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.435
Not a chance, Doc.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.033
- Colonel...
- Look, I don't have time to argue.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.429
Besides, you got to get
these people ready for transport.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.149
Once the gate's secure,
we're gonna have to move fast.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.958
Okay, but be careful.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.388
All right.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.471
If we're gonna attack,
we gotta do it from over there.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.709
Agreed.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.440
McKAY: As soon as we take the gate,
we should call in some Jumpers.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.397
It'll make evacuating
the village a lot faster.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.232
Not to mention
we can use the extra firepower

11:35.320 --> 11:37.151
in case the hive gets here
before we're done.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.958
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.110
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
- Go ahead.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.349
We have a problem.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.078
More of the Wraith
have begun arriving back.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.515
They must have been out on patrol.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.478
- How many? Can we still get out?
- No.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.028
For the time being, we're stuck here.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.398
You said you could get us out.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.471
Well, there are more Wraith
than we thought.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.232
The gate's too heavily guarded.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.151
- So we're trapped?
- For the moment.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.038
I haven't given up hope.
I just need time to develop a new strategy.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.829
What strategy do you propose
we use to defeat an army of Wraith?

12:11.920 --> 12:14.878
Well, I don't know.
I haven't thought of it yet.

12:15.880 --> 12:19.156
Look, worst-case scenario,
my team and I don't show up,

12:19.240 --> 12:22.835
the people back on Atlantis
will dial the gate and contact us by radio.

12:22.920 --> 12:23.909
I can order backup.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.560
Will that happen
before the hive ship arrives?

12:27.560 --> 12:30.233
- Probably not.
- We can't wait that long.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.993
For all we know, the Wraith
could be lying about the ship.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.433
And why would they do that?

12:34.520 --> 12:37.592
I'm just saying,
we need to stall as long as possible.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.193
This is madness.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.510
Elson, we have to think
of the safety of our people.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.591
I'm thinking about
the safety of your people.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.558
- All your people.
- We can't rely on their help.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.633
- We have to make our own decisions.
- I need time to think about this.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.234
The time for that has passed, Elson.

12:53.320 --> 12:58.314
We have to act, and if you're not
prepared to do so, then I will.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.949
Jervis!

13:03.360 --> 13:04.679
What's he gonna do?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.354
I don't know.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.838
- Where's Novo and the others?
- We sent them home. Why?

13:15.360 --> 13:17.078
Can these people walk?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.799
Well, if need be, but I thought
we couldn't get them through the gate.

13:19.880 --> 13:24.317
No, we can't for the time being,
but I don't think they're safe here, either.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.032
Grab your weapons.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.193
Come with me.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.793
- Get out of my way.
- She's not here, Jervis.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.633
Where is she?

14:19.680 --> 14:22.274
What are we gonna do, Novo?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.669
We have to get out of the village.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.631
What the hell's going on out there?

14:39.720 --> 14:42.518
Some of the villagers decided
to take matters into their own hands.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.231
- Well, let's go stop them.
First things first.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.073
We got to move these people.
Grab some gear.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.833
We don't want any trouble.
Just hand over the Balarans.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.631
- I don't think so.
- Don't make things difficult, Colonel.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.110
You had your chance to save the village.
Now it's my turn.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.714
Saving the village.
That's what you call this?

15:05.800 --> 15:08.109
This isn't your affair.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.998
It's up to us to decide
how to deal with the situation.

15:11.080 --> 15:15.949
Yes, it is, but, Jervis, this is not our way.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.758
Our way?

15:17.840 --> 15:21.958
Our way is what got us
into this situation in the first place.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.077
We've already given them more
than they could have ever asked for.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.278
All right, why not just shoot them
right now and get it over with?

15:29.360 --> 15:31.510
It's a death sentence, anyway.
Shoot them yourself,

15:31.600 --> 15:33.989
and spare them the torment
of being tortured by the Wraith.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.718
- You'd be doing them a favor.
- Carson.

15:35.800 --> 15:40.112
Go on. Kill them all, then, if you're
that desperate to be done with them!

15:50.480 --> 15:52.436
- You're making a big mistake.
Maybe.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.512
But at least we do so
with a clear conscience.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.078
- Doesn't matter, anyway.
- What are you talking about?

16:01.160 --> 16:05.551
My men are already on the way to
the gate with the first group we captured.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.479
It's too late.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.918
What are they gonna do to us?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.036
Be calm, Sefaris.
You're scaring the others.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.510
Maybe they should be scared.
We both know there's no escape from this.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.556
We cannot give up hope.

16:29.640 --> 16:34.077
Face it, Novo, we've been betrayed.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.151
They don't want us here. They never did.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.391
We were doomed the moment
we had to leave our homes.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.834
And, to think, as a survivor,

16:42.920 --> 16:45.115
I used to consider myself
one of the lucky ones.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.115
Is Jervis taken care of?

16:51.200 --> 16:52.269
He and his men
have been locked up.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.032
They will not be giving us
any more trouble,

16:54.120 --> 16:56.395
though I do not think
it was necessary to stun them.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.914
- Felt good, though.
- So what now?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.116
I gotta get the rest of the Balarans
out of the village.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.589
There's no telling if anybody else
might feel the way Jervis does.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.636
- Where should we take them?
The forest.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.199
It's kind of a long haul at night.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.919
Wait a minute, what about the mine?
These tracks lead right down to it.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.479
I mean, we just follow them.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.516
No one gets lost.
McKAY: Exactly.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.876
All right, go get Beckett
and his patients, bring them here.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.154
We'll round up everyone else.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.354
- What is it?
- Something's happening.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.838
What's going on?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.552
You'll be moving shortly.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.915
Where?
- Your new home.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.275
The hive ship has just arrived.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.189
Wait.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.032
- I have a proposition for you.
- What are you doing, Sefaris?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.554
Something we should have done
a long time ago.

18:00.640 --> 18:04.792
- There is nothing you have to offer me.
- Don't be so sure.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.598
There's someone hiding in the village.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.114
He's of far greater value
than all of us put together.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.556
- Sefaris, no.
- Spare our lives, I'll take you to him.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.876
A fair attempt, but the answer's no.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.279
My life, then.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.758
How could you do this?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.308
I promise, it'll be worth your while.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.956
- I believe that is everybody.
- Where's McKay and Beckett?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.036
Rodney, what's your status?

18:37.120 --> 18:38.235
Still at the clinic.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.834
Carson decided to pick up
a few more supplies.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.229
Tell him to get a move on.
We can't stay here forever.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.833
Go ahead, Colonel.
We'll catch up.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.753
- You sure?
- Absolutely. We'll be right behind you.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.437
Let's get going.
Stay together. Follow the tracks.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.909
There. That should do it.
Rodney, can you give me a hand here?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.878
Remind me to bring a Sherpa
next time I visit.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.472
Him. He's the one.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.996
You see? I kept up my end of the bargain.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.599
So you did.

19:26.840 --> 19:30.799
Unfortunately, in light of your condition,

19:32.280 --> 19:35.238
keeping you alive is far too risky.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.550
Darts.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.279
- Rodney and Carson are still not here.
- Rodney, come in.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.512
McKay?

20:08.600 --> 20:11.353
You guys keep moving.
I'm gonna go get them.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.830
Ronon? Teyla?
- Go ahead.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.118
The Wraith just got Beckett and McKay.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.509
- What? How?
- Took them up in a Dart.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.199
I think they're on their way up to a hive.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.994
How did the Wraith know
that they were in the village?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.233
I think I got an idea.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.512
Rodney. Rodney, wake up.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.391
God, is it me,
or have they juiced up the stun weapons?

21:06.960 --> 21:09.428
And they brought us to the hive.
That's great.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.794
What are we gonna do?

21:10.880 --> 21:13.519
All right, just don't panic. Don't panic.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.592
I've got lots of experience
escaping from these things.

21:18.680 --> 21:19.999
- You do?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.753
I've been in this situation dozens
of times, always figured a way out.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.400
- How, exactly?
- Let's see.

21:25.480 --> 21:28.916
Last time, Teyla was posing as a queen,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.275
so, you know, she had us released.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.954
- Not much chance of that happening.
- No, I guess not.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.508
- How about the time before that?
- Ronon's friend Tyre was pretending

21:36.600 --> 21:39.717
to be in league with the Wraith,
but really he was on our side,

21:39.800 --> 21:42.234
- so he let us out.
- I'm starting to sense a pattern here.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.756
You've actually never really escaped from
one of these cells on your own, have you?

21:45.840 --> 21:47.796
- First time for everything, right?
- God, Rodney.

21:47.880 --> 21:52.032
Well, just give me a minute.
I'll think of something.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.998
I hate to pressure you, Rodney,
but I don't think we have a minute.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.919
Bring them.

22:09.160 --> 22:13.950
- McKAY: What is this place?
- A lab belonging to my top scientist.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.432
For the last six months,
he has been studying the deadly toxin

22:18.520 --> 22:20.988
that has infiltrated our food supply.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.554
Where is he now?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.388
Dead.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.714
He was convinced he had arrived
at a foolproof way to detect the poison.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.599
To prove it, he decided to feed
on one of his test subjects.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.148
Guess that didn't work out so well.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.310
He died in excruciating pain.

22:42.920 --> 22:46.435
Needless to say,
his research has been stalled ever since.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.948
And that's where you come in, Doctor.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.909
Me? What do you expect me to do?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.592
The one who identified you said

22:56.680 --> 22:59.797
you had considerable expertise
in dealing with the toxin.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.877
He even said you had
a hand in developing it.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.077
If anyone can find a way to detect it,
you can.

23:07.160 --> 23:11.233
If you think I'm gonna help you,
you're sorely mistaken.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.914
I anticipated you might say that,

23:14.000 --> 23:17.595
which is why I'm prepared
to offer you an incentive.

23:17.680 --> 23:22.515
Thus far, I have spared the lives
of the people on the planet below.

23:22.600 --> 23:26.195
If you cooperate, I will continue to do so.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.555
But if either of you
try to cross me in any way...

23:28.640 --> 23:30.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get the picture.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.469
I knew you'd come to see it my way.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.073
Get to work.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.037
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't blow your head off.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.155
What for?

23:57.480 --> 23:59.835
How did the Wraith know to grab Beckett?

23:59.920 --> 24:02.115
What do you mean?
Doctor's been captured?

24:03.280 --> 24:05.874
I swear I had nothing to do with that.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.080
- What about your men?
- No. No, there's no way.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.912
The doctor has been
nothing but good to us.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.718
Well, they didn't just
stumble across the clinic.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.109
Somebody brought them there.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.672
Well, why don't you ask the Balarans?

24:21.760 --> 24:23.910
They're the ones
who had the most to gain.

24:24.680 --> 24:29.117
One of them probably thought he could
save himself by turning in the doctor.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.840
I told you they were no good, Colonel.

24:45.000 --> 24:45.989
Damn it.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.071
None of these consoles
are hooked into anything.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.356
I can't access any of the ship's systems.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.591
What about you?
You making any progress?

24:53.680 --> 24:54.829
Carson?

24:55.840 --> 24:57.512
Hey! You okay?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.791
I can't do this, Rodney.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.313
What do you mean?
You don't understand it?

25:02.400 --> 25:04.118
No. I mean, I can't do it.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.076
Do you realize what'll happen if the Wraith
find a way to detect the Hoffan drug?

25:08.160 --> 25:10.913
They'll hunt down every last person
in this galaxy that has it.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.594
That's hundreds of thousands
of people, Rodney.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.636
Not to mention the fact that,
when they're finished,

25:15.720 --> 25:18.075
they can start feeding again,
indiscriminately.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.673
What's the alternative?

25:19.760 --> 25:21.591
We know the Wraith aren't just
gonna let the matter drop.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.999
We've seen what they can do.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.390
They'll wipe out entire villages
just to get a few like the Balarans.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.710
- So what am I supposed to do?
- You just stall.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.155
You know, you make it look
like you're working, and...

25:31.240 --> 25:32.878
Till we figure out
how to get the hell out of here.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.155
And then what? Go about our business?
Pretend this never happened?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.719
Yeah, I never said
it was gonna be easy, okay,

25:36.800 --> 25:40.395
but you can't solve all
the galaxy's problems in one day.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.153
Look, I understand.
You feel guilty, but this is not your fault.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.913
You had no idea
that any of this was gonna happen.

25:47.080 --> 25:51.392
One of the first things they taught us
in medical school was, "Do no harm. "

25:52.480 --> 25:57.110
Now, I'm at a loss right now to figure out
how that's even possible in this situation.

26:05.120 --> 26:09.159
- How are they doing?
- They are frightened.

26:09.240 --> 26:12.630
I've been trying to reassure them,
but it is of little use.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.113
How's it going in here?
- We are getting by.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.510
- What is happening in the village?
- Not much. Everybody's hiding indoors.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.511
Why hasn't the hive ship attacked yet?

26:21.600 --> 26:24.114
Do you think it could have something
to do with Rodney and Carson's capture?

26:24.200 --> 26:27.476
I don't know, but we should use
this time to come up with a plan.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.950
- You got anything?
- Maybe, but it's gonna take some work.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.838
- What is it? You got something?
- No.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.593
You sure?
You got one of those Beckett faces.

26:44.680 --> 26:47.148
Aye, I'm sure, Rodney.
Just go back to work.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.832
- Where you going?
- To talk to the hive commander.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.354
- What? Why?
- There's something I need to tell him.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.192
I knew it. You found something.
What is it?

26:53.280 --> 26:54.998
- Hey, open up!
- Seriously, will you just tell me?

26:55.080 --> 26:56.991
You know I'm gonna go through your stuff
as soon as you're gone.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.877
Just leave me be, Rodney. Open the door!

26:58.960 --> 27:01.269
Will you just tell me what's going on?

27:01.360 --> 27:03.271
I need to talk
to the commander right away.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.476
Listen to me, Rodney.
I need you to stay here.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.597
Don't worry.
Everything will be just fine. Right.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.510
Doctor, I didn't expect
to hear from you so soon.

27:29.800 --> 27:33.236
- This must be good news.
- For some people, maybe.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.436
I'm here to tell you that I'm off the case.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.471
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.551
- Find someone else.
- There is no one else.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.952
- Then that's too bad for you, isn't it?
- You're trying my patience, Doctor.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.472
You forget,
I control the fate of the people below.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.473
People will die no matter what I do,
so I'm not gonna do anything.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.389
If you refuse to complete the research,

28:01.480 --> 28:05.758
then there is only one other way
that you could be of use to me.

28:05.840 --> 28:09.719
And trust me, you won't like it.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.429
You don't scare me anymore.
Do you understand?

28:13.520 --> 28:17.399
- I don't give a damn what you do to me.
- Suit yourself.

28:18.680 --> 28:22.036
I'm going to enjoy this very much.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.159
What is this?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.113
What have you done to me?

28:44.200 --> 28:47.988
Turns out you're closer to detecting
the Hoffan drug than you thought.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.310
It didn't take me long
to perfect your blood test.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.518
And once I confirmed it
using samples that you provided,

28:54.600 --> 28:58.593
I decided to do one more test,
just to be certain.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.669
On me.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.071
- You have the toxin?
- Indeed.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.151
And now so do you.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.432
- Carson.
- Hello, Rodney.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.391
- Can you delete this data?
- Yeah, of course, but how did you...

29:30.480 --> 29:32.277
I talked the hive commander
into feeding on me.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.636
- What? What? Why would you do that?
- I have the Hoffan drug, Rodney.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.631
Michael must have given it to me
as a defense against the Wraith.

29:37.720 --> 29:38.755
Well, why didn't you tell me?

29:38.840 --> 29:39.955
Because you would have
stopped me from going.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.190
Yeah, because it's stupid. What would've
happened if you were wrong?

29:42.280 --> 29:44.635
I had to do something, Rodney.
It's the only chance we had to get away.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.073
Now, will you help me
destroy this research

29:46.160 --> 29:47.878
before they find out what I've done?

29:47.960 --> 29:49.632
- Right.
- Okay, great.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.272
The coast is clear.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.271
- What are we doing, exactly?
- What do you think?

30:00.360 --> 30:02.112
We're looking for a way off this ship.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.555
By wandering aimlessly
through the hallways?

30:04.640 --> 30:07.074
I'm not wandering aimlessly.
I'm exploring.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.071
There's a big difference.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.075
Bingo.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.389
- What are you doing, Rodney?
- Hacking into the ship's communications.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.993
Are you sure that's a good idea?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.433
Look, if we don't get in touch
with Sheppard,

30:28.520 --> 30:31.876
we don't stand any chance
of getting off this ship.

30:31.960 --> 30:35.157
- You're gonna have to cover me.
- All right. From which direction?

30:37.440 --> 30:38.759
What was that?

30:38.840 --> 30:41.195
- McKAY: Sheppard, do you read me?
- McKay, is that you?

30:41.880 --> 30:44.952
Thank God! Okay, we are on the hive ship.
I've got Beckett with me.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.238
- What the hell is going on up there?
- We managed to escape.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.797
- Beckett helped.
- That's great,

30:51.880 --> 30:54.110
- 'cause we could really use the help.
- You?

30:54.200 --> 30:55.952
Look, we're the ones stuck on the ship!

30:56.080 --> 30:57.399
That's exactly
where you need to be right now,

30:57.480 --> 31:00.711
because we need someone
to take out the hive's main weapons.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.319
- What?
- We got a plan,

31:02.400 --> 31:05.073
but it's only gonna work
if we take the hive out of the picture.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.151
Look, it is bad enough
that I hacked into communications.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.434
If I start messing around
with other systems,

31:08.520 --> 31:10.988
they're gonna track us down
in a matter of minutes.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.548
Rodney, it's the only way
to get these people to safety.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.108
Once that's done, we'll figure out a way
to get you guys out of there.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.874
All right. I'll see what I can do.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.473
Give me a few minutes.
That should be enough time.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.871
- You're a good man, Rodney.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.918
- Just don't forget about us, okay?
- We won't. Good luck.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.833
- Think he's gonna be able to pull it off?
- Well, he better.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.639
Otherwise,
this thing's gonna go very badly.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.195
Jervis.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.436
- Jervis.
- What do you want?

32:05.520 --> 32:09.832
- We need to talk.
- Well, I have nothing to say to you.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.595
You were right all along.
I should have listened to you.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.752
The Atlantians have no idea
what they're doing.

32:17.840 --> 32:23.233
They claim to have a plan, but in reality
they're just putting all our lives at risk.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.309
Well,

32:28.760 --> 32:30.751
it's a little late now, isn't it?

32:32.720 --> 32:34.153
Is it?

32:34.240 --> 32:37.152
If you went to the Wraith
at the gate right now,

32:37.240 --> 32:40.596
do you think you could get them
to honor the original deal?

32:40.680 --> 32:42.671
It's possible,

32:42.760 --> 32:47.356
but I'd have to deliver
all of the remaining outsiders at once.

32:50.040 --> 32:53.271
They're in the mine,
hiding in the main chamber.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.391
Are the other councilors
on board with this?

32:56.480 --> 32:58.789
The less they know about it, the better.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.715
And you?

33:02.440 --> 33:05.193
Can you reconcile this
with your conscience?

33:07.520 --> 33:11.752
Leave that to me. You just make that deal.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.913
What is it?

33:42.040 --> 33:43.155
Search the ship.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.839
How long is this gonna take, Rodney?

33:46.920 --> 33:48.956
Do I rush you while you're performing
complicated surgery?

33:49.040 --> 33:50.712
Aye, it's been known to happen.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.875
All right, I'm in.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.474
Now, I just need a few minutes
to disable the...

33:56.240 --> 33:57.832
Jeez!

33:57.920 --> 34:00.798
- I think they found us!
- You figure?

34:00.880 --> 34:03.440
- Okay, you're gonna have to hold them off.
- Am I now?

34:03.520 --> 34:05.556
Yeah, come on, Carson.
You can do this, all right?

34:05.640 --> 34:07.437
All right. On three?

34:07.520 --> 34:09.795
- How about on one?
- All right. Right.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.279
And, one!

34:15.159 --> 34:18.630
- How's it coming?
- Almost there.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.188
I can't hold them off forever, Rodney.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.234
- We have to go now.
- All right, that's it. I got it. Let's go!

34:36.400 --> 34:37.674
Where we going?
McKAY: The Dart bay.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.955
- You know how to fly a Dart?
- Well, I've flown Jumpers before.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.031
I've been to Tokyo before,
doesn't mean I can speak Japanese.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.076
McKAY: Well, how hard can it be?

34:46.159 --> 34:47.195
Do you even know where you're going?

34:47.280 --> 34:49.190
I pulled up a schematic of the ship
on that console.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.748
What? While we were being fired upon?

34:58.360 --> 34:59.429
All right, that's sealed.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.557
- How long do you think it'll hold them?
- Not very.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.668
Well, come on.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.832
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting in.

35:17.920 --> 35:21.993
- We can't both fit in here.
- You're damn right I can. Now shove over!

35:23.280 --> 35:25.794
- You comfy?
- Peachy.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.752
What are you waiting for?

35:28.880 --> 35:30.518
- Well, it should just start up.
- Well, it didn't.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.715
Yeah, I know that,
but it doesn't make sense.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.392
I mean, a canopy should form
over our head.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.879
Maybe there's some kind of a weight limit.

35:34.960 --> 35:38.475
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean because there's two of us!

35:38.560 --> 35:39.675
Well, maybe you need a key or something.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.716
Well, it's not a Volkswagen, Carson!

35:41.800 --> 35:43.916
Okay, look,
these are obviously the flight controls

35:44.000 --> 35:45.672
that makes that propulsion, so...

35:45.760 --> 35:47.079
How did you come up with
that brilliant conclusion?

35:47.160 --> 35:49.355
It was just common sense.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.317
- Come on.
- Right, common sense.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.550
Look, what do you want from me?
It's not like there's labels.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.152
- Not good.
- You're telling me.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.071
- We need a new plan, Rodney.
- I know. I'm thinking.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.628
Whatever you do, think fast, because
if those Wraith come through that door,

36:01.720 --> 36:02.789
we're both dead.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.915
- Rodney, we need to go.
- Where? I mean, we're trapped in here.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.117
Well, then we need to find a place to hide.
Come on.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.758
- What?
- I have another idea.

36:15.840 --> 36:20.072
It's a long shot, but it might work.
But you're gonna have to get off me!

36:35.120 --> 36:37.793
Once you've taken these people,
you're gonna leave the village, right?

36:37.880 --> 36:38.949
For good?

36:39.040 --> 36:43.033
This place is of no concern to us.
All we want is the Balarans.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.795
There's a large chamber up ahead.
That's where they're hiding.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.951
Where are they?

36:54.040 --> 36:57.669
I don't understand.
He said they were here.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.036
They should be right here.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.073
What is this?

37:29.320 --> 37:31.117
Think we killed enough Wraith
to make a difference?

37:31.200 --> 37:32.918
Guess we'll find out.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.319
Nice work.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.717
I've received word
of an explosion on the planet

37:52.800 --> 37:54.472
that's killed several of our warriors.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.279
The humans continue to attack our troops.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.271
They're trying to escape.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.954
Target the area around the portal
and open fire.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.958
- Weapons aren't responding!
- What?

38:19.800 --> 38:21.279
Dial the gate.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.552
This is the first group.
There are more coming.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.675
All right, we've got to move fast.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.239
They're not going to take this lying down.
Let's go.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.630
All right. Come on, let's go.
Stay low, stay low.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.595
We've lost contact
with the troops at the gate.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.475
- What about the two human prisoners?
- They're nowhere to be seen.

38:47.560 --> 38:52.031
They couldn't have just disappeared.
It doesn't matter.

38:52.120 --> 38:55.112
We can't let the villagers escape.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.758
Launch the Darts.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.390
Colonel!

39:05.480 --> 39:07.038
Go, go, go, move!

39:15.640 --> 39:16.709
Crap!

39:23.080 --> 39:24.991
Sheppard! We've got more coming!

39:29.560 --> 39:31.790
Go, go, go! You're almost there.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.189
Teyla!

39:38.880 --> 39:40.757
- Rodney! Carson!
- Oh, my God, it worked.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.353
- Rodney, you're a genius.
- What'd you do?

39:42.440 --> 39:44.032
I reprogrammed the culling beam
to dematerialize us,

39:44.120 --> 39:45.473
then to discharge only from that point on.

39:45.560 --> 39:46.993
I mean, once the Wraith
lost their main weapons,

39:47.080 --> 39:49.469
I knew it was just a matter of time
for them to launch the Darts.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.155
Let's go!

40:05.680 --> 40:07.875
There you are. I've been calling you.

40:08.800 --> 40:09.949
I'm sorry. What's up?

40:10.080 --> 40:12.196
Lorne's team just found
a suitable planet for the villagers.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.349
They're gonna move them out
this afternoon.

40:13.440 --> 40:15.874
Aye, I heard. I'm going with them.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.793
Right. Of course.
Well, you want to grab some lunch?

40:18.880 --> 40:20.598
We didn't get any chance
to socialize this time around,

40:20.680 --> 40:22.875
unless you count, you know,
running through the halls of a hive ship

40:22.960 --> 40:25.155
- as social time.
- Aye, you're right.

40:25.240 --> 40:28.073
Look, Rodney, I'd love to,
but I really need to get through this.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.149
Well, what is it?

40:29.240 --> 40:32.357
Dr. Keller's research on the serum
that keeps my cells from deteriorating.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.159
I think there might be something in here
to help the plague survivors

40:35.240 --> 40:37.117
since I'm not getting
the infections that they are.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.634
Well, you don't have to do this now.
I'll download the data to a drive.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.951
- You can just, you know, take it with you.
- Actually, you can't.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.271
Mr. Woolsey doesn't want it
leaving the base.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.510
- I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Well, I don't care.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.239
No, I was just trying to stop you
from whining about never seeing me.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.594
All right.

40:54.080 --> 40:55.638
Rodney, wait.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.314
Now that I think of it,
I am a wee bit peckish.

40:58.400 --> 41:02.598
Besides, I can't solve all
the galaxy's problems in one day, can I?

41:02.680 --> 41:05.319
- Well, it's...
- Shut it. Right, let's go.

41:07.680 --> 41:10.592
So, interested in anyone these days?

41:10.720 --> 41:13.393
Me? No, I don't have time for that.

41:13.480 --> 41:17.155
You're a terrible liar, Dr. McKay.
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
