00:01.634 --> 00:02.934
You know, it should have worked.

00:02.969 --> 00:04.469
The spell we did
to contact my brother.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.557
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

00:06.609 --> 00:08.693
Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

00:08.786 --> 00:10.462
- No! No! No!
- I bind you!

00:10.608 --> 00:11.649
I bind you!

00:11.900 --> 00:13.681
[speaking foreign language]

00:13.892 --> 00:15.531
Why did you think that
you had to save me?

00:15.611 --> 00:17.207
He was gonna kill you.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.542
I'm done here, for good.
You should be happy.

00:19.621 --> 00:21.217
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

00:21.252 --> 00:23.152
Bigger, better magic.

00:23.188 --> 00:26.056
Let's go steal their shit.

00:26.091 --> 00:27.891
He's not gonna wake up ever.

00:27.926 --> 00:29.726
<i>Marina is a psycho.</i>

00:29.761 --> 00:32.728
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

00:32.762 --> 00:34.130
Ow!

00:34.165 --> 00:36.132
You don't know cut off.

00:36.167 --> 00:39.235
But you can actually move
between worlds.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.537
If the gift does not
kill you first.

00:41.573 --> 00:44.073
<i>Please, help me.</i>
[gasps]

00:46.471 --> 00:48.310
I have a full schedule today,
Quentin.

00:48.345 --> 00:50.412
- What?
- Uh, I just, um...

00:50.447 --> 00:52.275
The point?

00:52.883 --> 00:54.872
What's gonna happen to Julia?

00:55.242 --> 00:56.852
Ah, yes.

00:57.181 --> 00:59.722
Your hedge witch friend.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.384
I'm going to kill her.

01:04.739 --> 01:05.703
I, uh...

01:05.822 --> 01:08.863
[laughing]

01:08.898 --> 01:10.532
I'm...

01:10.567 --> 01:13.235
I'm fucking with you, Quentin.

01:13.270 --> 01:15.556
I'm not going
to do anything to her.

01:16.163 --> 01:18.906
I thought you would erase her
memory or something... again.

01:18.942 --> 01:22.376
Sure, then her buddies tell
her about magic all over again.

01:22.411 --> 01:25.073
Then she bothers me again.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.630
So she's just gonna
get away with it?

01:26.722 --> 01:29.717
I'm not the magic police,
Quentin.

01:30.153 --> 01:31.630
They won't be back here.

01:31.749 --> 01:34.188
They know what'll
rain down on them if they do.

01:34.423 --> 01:36.224
What they do out there,
it's not my business;

01:36.259 --> 01:38.459
it's not yours.
Do you understand?

01:38.494 --> 01:40.160
<i>Don't you worry,
Hedge witches tend</i>

01:40.195 --> 01:43.535
<i>to crash and burn

01:43.917 --> 01:45.766
I want the spells I'm missing
so I can keep going.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.968
I want the new ones she stole
because I helped her.

01:48.003 --> 01:51.739
- You're not coming inside.
- Then bring 'em out.

01:51.774 --> 01:53.139
They're locked
in her filing cabinet,

01:53.175 --> 01:55.441
and even if I could, I wouldn't.

01:55.477 --> 01:57.244
I don't want
to see you get hurt,

01:57.279 --> 02:00.180
and Marina will hurt you.

02:00.215 --> 02:03.116
She only helped you get out of
Brakebills jail to save herself.

02:03.151 --> 02:05.518
Next time, you will not
be so lucky.

02:05.553 --> 02:07.921
[laughs] That's bullshit.

02:07.956 --> 02:09.923
I earned that magic
just as much as her.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.357
Fuck, more.

02:11.393 --> 02:14.460
- It was my friend that she used...
- Your friend!

02:17.231 --> 02:19.365
Look, Marina's the boss.
Life ain't fair.

02:19.401 --> 02:21.200
Woe is you. Now, please,

02:21.235 --> 02:23.770
leave before she sees you here.

02:26.474 --> 02:28.473
[sighs]

02:30.144 --> 02:32.211
Think of it as applying
for an internship,

02:32.246 --> 02:34.880
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

02:34.916 --> 02:38.322
Alumni come and choose
students to mentor.

02:39.253 --> 02:42.747
I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

02:43.357 --> 02:45.824
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

02:45.859 --> 02:49.394
but I'd really like you
to come back.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.730
This is just one small corner
of the world.

02:51.765 --> 02:53.331
There's a lot more
out there to see,

02:53.366 --> 02:55.148
and I'd like you to see it.

02:55.531 --> 02:57.469
[scoffs]
I don't much like the corners

02:57.504 --> 02:59.370
that I've already seen.

02:59.406 --> 03:03.408
Alice, students
leave every year,

03:03.443 --> 03:05.410
and I don't go searching
for every lost lamb.

03:05.445 --> 03:06.877
You didn't invite me.

03:06.913 --> 03:09.713
I had to sneak in
just to take the entrance exam.

03:09.749 --> 03:11.877
I made a mistake.

03:12.352 --> 03:15.219
I felt responsible for
what happened to your brother,

03:15.255 --> 03:17.988
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.324
Alice, I was wrong.

03:20.359 --> 03:24.161
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

03:24.196 --> 03:26.063
Just come back for a week,

03:26.098 --> 03:28.766
and if you don't like it,
then, please, by all means,

03:28.801 --> 03:31.034

<i>This year, we're going to win
the alumni week Hunger Games.</i>

03:37.542 --> 03:40.710
My mentor last year was a nun.
Never again.

03:40.745 --> 03:42.379
I specialize in feet.

03:42.414 --> 03:46.549
Broken bones, warts... I have some
very interesting stuff

03:46.585 --> 03:48.518
for fungi of the toenail.

03:48.553 --> 03:50.920
99% of these mentors

03:50.956 --> 03:55.558
lead to a lifetime of soporific
bourgeois magic hell.

03:58.062 --> 03:59.451
Alice.

04:00.765 --> 04:02.222
You're, uh...

04:03.434 --> 04:04.702
Hi.

04:05.103 --> 04:07.512
I'm going to get a drink.

04:10.508 --> 04:13.142
- Is Genji your aunt?
- Oh, hey, Alice.

04:13.177 --> 04:15.111
- Is that Genji?
- Do you guys know her?

04:15.146 --> 04:17.646
Everyone does.
She runs a retreat.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.648
It's like Camp David for magicians.

04:19.683 --> 04:21.950
If Camp David
was run by Caligula.

04:21.986 --> 04:23.318
[chuckles]

04:23.353 --> 04:26.221
I mean that in the best way.

04:26.256 --> 04:28.394
- Excuse me.
- Wa...

04:31.962 --> 04:35.230
I feel really terrible about, um...

04:35.265 --> 04:37.658
I just thought... I wouldn't be
standing here talking to me

04:37.856 --> 04:39.401
if I were you.

04:39.436 --> 04:41.141
I don't...

04:41.971 --> 04:44.239
I shouldn't blame you.

04:44.558 --> 04:47.808
The truth is,
my brother died five years ago.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.477
Still, I...

04:49.513 --> 04:51.642
I should go help her.

I'm your mentor.

05:26.982 --> 05:28.615
Yeah, I didn't ask for a mentor.

05:28.650 --> 05:30.016
I don't give a shit.

What, a Pisces?

05:34.489 --> 05:36.322
Travelers are rare.

05:36.357 --> 05:37.791
Hadn't been one at Brakebills

05:37.826 --> 05:41.044
in 35 years, I guess.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.563
There's no discipline

05:43.599 --> 05:45.831
that has more power
and possibility.

05:45.866 --> 05:48.234
I get it. It's an amazing gift.

05:48.269 --> 05:52.271
It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

05:59.165 --> 06:01.581
I zapped myself
onto Mount Everest.

06:01.616 --> 06:03.548
Lost my leg to frostbite.

06:03.941 --> 06:06.485
I'd be dead if not for one

06:06.520 --> 06:09.254
deeply confused Sherpa.

06:09.943 --> 06:11.657
Had the lecture yet on

06:11.692 --> 06:13.759
sticking with astral projection?

06:13.794 --> 06:15.360
I don't watch "Star Trek."

06:15.395 --> 06:17.930
Travelers' training wheels.

06:17.965 --> 06:20.932
Your body stays here;
your mind travels.

06:20.967 --> 06:22.700
It's like being a ghost.

06:22.981 --> 06:24.702
Meditating

06:24.738 --> 06:26.971
won't stop you
from having a wet dream

06:27.007 --> 06:29.412
and waking up
in the Marianas Trench.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.743
This will.

06:35.181 --> 06:37.749
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

06:37.784 --> 06:40.936
Astral projection only.

06:41.371 --> 06:43.020
Full stop.

06:46.938 --> 06:49.661
Won't make the voices go away,

06:49.696 --> 06:52.479
but it might keep you alive.

06:54.634 --> 06:58.068
How could you know about all
this and become a podiatrist?

06:58.442 --> 07:01.305
This isn't Middle Earth, Quentin.

07:01.340 --> 07:04.341
There aren't enough
noble quests to go around.

07:04.377 --> 07:06.843
Impress a good mentor,
and you won't have to worry.

07:07.272 --> 07:08.745

to impress anyone?

07:08.781 --> 07:10.981
Mm, when you're not impressive?

07:11.016 --> 07:12.783
Glad you asked.

07:12.818 --> 07:15.418
Welters.
[groans]

07:15.453 --> 07:17.154
- What's Welters?
- The worst.

07:17.189 --> 07:19.455
It's a game
designed a billion years ago

07:19.491 --> 07:21.858
to keep students from
killing each other in duels.

07:21.894 --> 07:23.293
It's like chess.

07:23.328 --> 07:25.127
Kind of. Not really.

07:25.163 --> 07:28.531
You use magic to take squares.
It's terrible.

07:28.836 --> 07:29.965
I don't know.
That sounds kind of fun.

07:30.001 --> 07:32.302
- It's boring as death.
- You're boring.

07:32.337 --> 07:34.937
- You're boring.
- There's gonna be a tournament.

07:34.972 --> 07:38.107
It's supposed to be a surprise,
but I like ruining things.

07:38.142 --> 07:40.142
Each discipline fields a team,

07:40.178 --> 07:42.277
and the mentors will be watching,

07:42.313 --> 07:45.715
so don't screw this up for me.

Well, luckily there are
some treatment options,

some, uh, really interesting
new therapies.

09:22.007 --> 09:23.474
Uh, do you feel sick?

Eh, I feel...

09:26.145 --> 09:27.497

09:54.673 --> 09:56.539

the world bearable to you,

10:25.035 --> 10:27.670
then you go off
and do card tricks.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.271
Yeah, well, it wasn't
anything too exciting.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.139

11:40.175 --> 11:42.743

11:44.480 --> 11:48.447
Uh, I was wondering
if you could do me a tiny favor.

11:48.483 --> 11:50.984
I helped you find
Emily Greenstreet.

11:51.019 --> 11:52.618
Right.

11:52.653 --> 11:56.155
See, I still haven't
been selected by a mentor yet.

11:59.027 --> 12:01.094
We're such good friends,
I just...

12:01.129 --> 12:03.128
I figured you could put
a good word in to your aunt.

If you wouldn't mind
putting in a good word for me.

12:05.666 --> 12:07.900

They need to adjust your meds.

13:22.696 --> 13:25.388
I'm not taking any meds, Quentin.

13:26.744 --> 13:28.578
How bad is it?

13:28.613 --> 13:31.414
I have a glioblastoma.

13:31.450 --> 13:33.016

13:33.051 --> 13:36.219
It's the most common type

13:37.855 --> 13:39.489
It's also the most severe.

13:39.889 --> 13:41.257
But it's treatable?

13:41.293 --> 13:42.692
There are treatments available.

13:42.727 --> 13:45.795
I chose not to pursue them.

13:48.121 --> 13:49.966

13:57.609 --> 13:59.741

that jumps out at you

13:59.776 --> 14:01.243
is impaired cognitive function,

14:01.278 --> 14:04.213
so maybe you deciding
not to pursue treatment

14:04.248 --> 14:08.146
- without talking...
- My doctors agree with me, Q.

14:08.652 --> 14:12.587

where it's located...

14:12.816 --> 14:15.415

out of surgery...

14:16.793 --> 14:18.512

14:18.710 --> 14:20.094
I don't want you to die.

14:20.130 --> 14:23.431
Yeah, I'm not too crazy
about it myself.

14:23.466 --> 14:25.530
Then why are you giving up?

14:38.969 --> 14:40.948
You remember this?

14:46.070 --> 14:49.322
My dad and I used to build
model airplanes.

14:51.961 --> 14:53.561
And this,

14:53.596 --> 14:56.163
this was my absolute favorite.

When you were
about two years old,

15:09.811 --> 15:11.144
you got your hands on this,

15:11.180 --> 15:14.907
and you broke off
one of the wings.

15:15.684 --> 15:18.585
I spent about an hour
with a hot glue gun

15:18.620 --> 15:20.382
trying to fix it.

15:20.889 --> 15:22.816
It ended up in

15:23.058 --> 15:25.625
about 20 pieces instead of 2.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.064
Quentin,

15:27.361 --> 15:30.663
sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

Oh, excuse me.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.845
My father's dying,

15:46.880 --> 15:48.911

15:49.775 --> 15:52.097
If magicians could cure cancer

15:52.189 --> 15:54.355
why would anybody have cancer?

15:54.390 --> 15:57.025
Because we like secrets.

[light piano music]

15:58.661 --> 16:00.461
There's got to be

16:00.830 --> 16:02.496
Amazing things are possible,

16:02.728 --> 16:04.598
but cancer,

16:04.734 --> 16:06.567
it's a part of you,

16:06.602 --> 16:08.069
intrinsically, in a way

16:08.104 --> 16:11.405
that magic can't separate.

16:11.441 --> 16:14.206
Some people think it is magic,

16:15.168 --> 16:17.711
an old curse we can't break.

16:18.136 --> 16:19.914
So then, somebody
must have tried.

16:19.949 --> 16:21.649
I mean, look, even
if it's experimental, I...

16:21.684 --> 16:24.985

didn't fix his eyes?

16:25.020 --> 16:26.754
I guess I just assumed
he couldn't.

16:26.789 --> 16:28.055
Treating something like that

16:28.090 --> 16:31.832
requires an enormous amount
of energy,

16:32.294 --> 16:34.328
and that comes at a cost.

16:34.363 --> 16:36.568
So does everything.

and you haven't, not once,
taken any of our advice.

38:47.942 --> 38:50.647
No wonder they didn't
let you into Brakebills.

38:55.418 --> 38:57.041
[gasping]

38:59.640 --> 39:02.920
I gave it a shot.
I tried to get into alumni week.

39:02.956 --> 39:04.522
I just... I'm sorry.

39:04.557 --> 39:07.325
I don't care about becoming
a magical podiatrist

39:07.361 --> 39:11.397
or cataloging cryptids,
throwing huge parties.

39:12.098 --> 39:14.465
Honestly...
What do you care about?

39:16.369 --> 39:18.703
I don't know.
I'm still figuring that out.

39:18.738 --> 39:21.971
Well, then this is
the perfect place to be.

39:22.542 --> 39:23.774
Oh...

39:23.810 --> 39:27.406
Charlie would be
so proud, sweetheart,

39:27.746 --> 39:31.081
and you can always run away
to me whenever you like.

39:31.723 --> 39:34.612
[muttering indistinctly]
What are these two staring at?

39:34.823 --> 39:35.685
Quick, here she comes.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.355
Get ready for the first spanking
you won't enjoy.

39:38.391 --> 39:40.259
That's actually kind of hot.

39:42.427 --> 39:45.428
Dears, while you are both
quite impressive,

39:45.463 --> 39:48.565
honestly, the thought
of working with you exhausts me,

39:48.600 --> 39:51.568
and I'm too vain to sacrifice
my looks in that way.

39:51.603 --> 39:54.571
No, no, I mean,
we totally get it.

39:55.782 --> 39:57.040
Maybe next year?

39:57.075 --> 39:58.763
Sure.

40:04.765 --> 40:06.678
Well...
[sighs]

40:06.984 --> 40:09.285
What do we need her for anyway?

40:09.320 --> 40:11.387
We can start our own
bed-and-breakfast.

40:11.423 --> 40:12.808
Retreat.

40:13.091 --> 40:14.790
Hotel.

40:14.825 --> 40:16.324
- Bathhouse?
- Mm.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.692
[both laughing]

40:19.664 --> 40:22.130
Helps if you hold
a pleasant image in mind,

40:22.166 --> 40:24.499
such as a baby,

40:24.535 --> 40:26.334
if you tolerate those.

40:26.370 --> 40:29.638
Circumstances are more favorable
on a waxing moon.

40:29.674 --> 40:31.406
That's not to say
that it can't be done.

40:31.442 --> 40:34.580
It's cooperative, so partner up.

40:35.345 --> 40:38.120
[indistinct murmuring]

40:41.452 --> 40:43.385
Lab partners?

40:51.861 --> 40:53.534
About your dad...

40:54.798 --> 40:56.197
Yeah.

40:56.232 --> 40:59.934
<i>[solemn music]</i>

40:59.970 --> 41:02.545
Well, can they fix him?

41:03.838 --> 41:05.372
Can we fix him?

41:08.423 --> 41:10.007
[sighs]
Quentin?

41:11.547 --> 41:13.547
You can get through this.

41:19.355 --> 41:21.885
I wasn't sure
if you were gonna, um...

41:22.858 --> 41:24.128
I...

41:25.594 --> 41:27.544
I'm glad you came back.

41:31.399 --> 41:34.367
<i>[eerie music]</i>

41:38.340 --> 41:41.374
Looks like "Game of Thrones" fan art.

41:41.409 --> 41:43.843
Super helpful.

41:43.878 --> 41:47.044
You should ask
Quentin and Alice.

41:47.382 --> 41:50.158
- Hell no.
- It saw you.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.139
Penny, they're involved.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.329
Fu...

41:56.596 --> 41:59.859
All I can say is
it was some kind of dungeon.

42:00.359 --> 42:02.227
This was on the walls.

42:02.263 --> 42:04.196
It's a...

42:04.231 --> 42:07.199
<i>[tense music]</i>

42:11.572 --> 42:13.705
That's Ember's seal.

42:19.879 --> 42:21.134
Uh...

42:31.977 --> 42:34.141
Penny, I think you were in Fillory.
