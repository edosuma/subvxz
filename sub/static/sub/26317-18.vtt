WEBVTT

00:00.227 --> 00:02.636
- PREVIOUSLY ON SWAT...
- I'm done.

00:02.660 --> 00:03.836
I can't do this anymore.

00:03.860 --> 00:05.828
I'm turning in my 30-day notice.

00:06.323 --> 00:07.634
Pick another team leader.

00:07.658 --> 00:09.469
Deacon or Rocker. Whoever.

00:09.493 --> 00:11.744
- You the K9 unit?
- Officer Alonso, sir.

00:11.768 --> 00:13.378
Champ and I are ready
to go in when needed.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.608
Hey...

00:15.632 --> 00:17.536
If we start a relationship with you,

00:17.560 --> 00:20.313
you will be an equal part
in that new relationship.

00:20.337 --> 00:21.814
They both want to date you?

00:21.838 --> 00:23.890
What are the rules?

00:23.914 --> 00:25.285
My daughter has a hole in her heart

00:25.309 --> 00:26.319
and she needs it closed now.

00:26.343 --> 00:28.037
And I don't have $11,000 lying around.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.956
A man's got to carry his family
on his own two feet.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.124
Otherwise he's not a man.

00:31.148 --> 00:32.287
I need a loan.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.329
Wait, I can't work for
two to three months?

00:36.353 --> 00:37.664
You made me give you that cash,

00:37.688 --> 00:38.831
and now you're not gonna pay it back?

00:38.855 --> 00:40.166
How's that any different than robbing me?

00:40.190 --> 00:41.384
I just need more time.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.502
Well, then, we need to work
something out.

00:42.526 --> 00:43.720
If it's not cash,

00:43.744 --> 00:46.194
then a favor. What kind of favor?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

01:05.882 --> 01:07.549
Sit down, already!

01:17.227 --> 01:18.393
Move.

01:21.732 --> 01:23.031
Maddox, take a seat.

01:25.786 --> 01:26.735
Now.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.708
Better view over here anyway.

01:46.890 --> 01:48.234
All right.

01:48.258 --> 01:50.175
That's it for today. We're good to roll.

02:00.771 --> 02:02.298
Rubina, I didn't realize

02:02.322 --> 02:03.633
you were allowed out of the tech lab.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.526
I just came from the vet.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.076
I've got some bad news, Chris.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.556
Champ's gotten worse, hasn't he?

02:10.580 --> 02:11.808
The cancer's aggressive,

02:11.832 --> 02:13.867
and he's not exactly a young dog.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.646
I'll pay for whatever treatment.
You know that.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.097
He was my partner.

02:18.121 --> 02:19.766
I'm afraid we're past that point.

02:19.790 --> 02:22.101
The vet says we need
to put him down soon.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.127
The kids are heartbroken.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.489
You guys gave him the best retirement

02:26.513 --> 02:28.507
a K9 could ever ask for.

02:28.965 --> 02:30.880
We're not gonna do anything

02:30.904 --> 02:32.996
until you get a chance to say good-bye.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.281
But don't put it off.

02:35.305 --> 02:36.849
I won't.

02:36.873 --> 02:38.556
I'll make it happen today.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.262
If only Mumford could've
held off retiring

02:49.286 --> 02:50.596
for just another month.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.598
It doesn't matter.
Deacon is the man for the job.

02:52.622 --> 02:55.435
Back injury or not.
I mean, if not him, who?

02:55.459 --> 02:56.936
I don't know, Rocker, he's completed

02:56.960 --> 02:57.970
his Sergeant-Two requirements, you know,

02:57.994 --> 02:59.355
that puts him in the running.

02:59.379 --> 03:00.773
Hondo, who's your bet
to take over Mumford's team

03:00.797 --> 03:03.109
now that he's on his way out?
It's got to be Deacon, right?

03:03.133 --> 03:05.412
Well, they couldn't do better. It's
about time he got his own squad.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.280
Yeah, but he's not back
to full beast mode yet.

03:07.304 --> 03:09.282
You think that could tip
the scales against him?

03:09.306 --> 03:10.650
He's been working his ass off
to get there.

03:10.674 --> 03:12.024
Where is he, anyway? We seen him?

03:12.048 --> 03:14.143
Oh, he called.
He said he had physical therapy.

03:14.167 --> 03:16.227
Hasn't given up on coming back
to work early.

03:18.014 --> 03:19.208
This week's payment.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.294
- In full?
- I'm a little short, but

03:21.318 --> 03:22.712
you'll have the rest
next time, no problem.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.047
Where have I heard that before?

03:24.071 --> 03:25.665
Oh, yeah...

03:25.689 --> 03:27.965
coming out of your mouth
the last time you were here.

03:27.989 --> 03:30.386
I haven't been cleared yet for
full duty. Once that happens...

03:30.410 --> 03:31.504
Maybe there's another way.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.306
I talked to my bosses.

03:33.330 --> 03:36.509
They're willing to forego
the loan for a few favors.

03:37.492 --> 03:38.845
Need you to run a license plate.

03:38.869 --> 03:41.850
No way. Last week's tip was
too close to the line.

03:41.874 --> 03:43.154
I... This is not what I signed up for.

03:43.178 --> 03:44.734
No, you signed up to pay back your debts,

03:44.758 --> 03:45.735
but you're not doing that.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.186
I'm not doing this.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.688
You're not leaving me a lot of options.

03:48.712 --> 03:51.190
Obviously, I'm not in a position
to muscle you.

03:51.590 --> 03:55.578
So the only choice I have left
is to, uh, go to your bosses.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.164
That's not gonna be good
for either of us, maybe.

03:58.188 --> 04:00.032
But it's definitely worse for you.

04:00.599 --> 04:03.113
Look. I'm telling you I just
need a little more time.

04:03.137 --> 04:05.922
Make it easy for both of us.
Okay? This isn't a big deal.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.540
No one's gonna get killed or hurt.

04:07.564 --> 04:08.813
Just run the damn plate.

04:20.076 --> 04:22.043
Any minute now.

04:33.662 --> 04:35.546
Right on time.

05:14.097 --> 05:16.075
I don't know if he's stupid,
crazy or what,

05:16.099 --> 05:17.610
but as soon as we approached,
someone inside

05:17.634 --> 05:19.162
started taking potshots at us.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.080
Prisoner must've gotten a hold
of a guard's gun.

05:21.104 --> 05:22.165
- Anybody get hit?
- Not yet,

05:22.189 --> 05:23.499
but one of my guys is inside.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.618
- He's in the bus right now?
- Yeah. An EMT.

05:25.642 --> 05:27.170
He was first on the scene.
Managed to climb in,

05:27.194 --> 05:28.504
and that's when the shooting started.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.122
He radioed that he was okay,
but one of the guards

05:30.146 --> 05:31.591
- is seriously injured.
- Hondo, we don't have time

05:31.615 --> 05:33.793
to wait around, hoping
this guy runs out of ammo.

05:34.192 --> 05:36.534
No. We got to get
on that bus now. Load up.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.188
Luca, Tan, Chris, get to the front,

05:45.212 --> 05:46.838
see if you can get a visual.
Street, you're with me. Go.

05:46.862 --> 05:48.079
- Luca...
- Yep.

06:09.986 --> 06:12.164
24-David. Looks like the driver's dead.

06:12.188 --> 06:13.655
Didn't stand a chance.

06:16.493 --> 06:18.337
I've got eyes on the EMT and the guard.

06:18.820 --> 06:20.139
The EMT's okay,

06:20.163 --> 06:21.173
but the guard looks like

06:21.197 --> 06:23.158
he's in bad shape. We got to do this now.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.811
This is the LAPD!

06:25.835 --> 06:27.013
Drop the gun!

06:27.037 --> 06:28.147
Stay away from me!

06:28.171 --> 06:30.483
- What's your name, man?
- Uh...

06:31.124 --> 06:32.685
It's, uh, Tito.

06:32.709 --> 06:34.654
He sounds like he's possibly concussed.

06:34.678 --> 06:36.188
Tito!

06:36.212 --> 06:37.990
I need you to drop that
gun for me, all right?

06:38.014 --> 06:40.076
We got to get you some help.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.360
Windows are all barred.

06:41.384 --> 06:42.778
Doorway's blocked. No access from here.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.247
All right, that
leaves me and Street, then.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.698
I need you to create a distraction.

06:45.722 --> 06:46.866
Draw his attention to the front.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.701
Roger that. On your count.

06:48.725 --> 06:50.453
All right, here we go. Three,

06:50.477 --> 06:52.644
two, one, now.

07:01.196 --> 07:04.216
Tito? Take it easy, man. It's over.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.602
You hear me? It's over.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.937
This is 20-David to Command.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.188
Target secure.

07:09.212 --> 07:11.107
First responders are free to approach.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.497
Boss.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.502
Check it out.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.898
According to the
Department of Corrections,

07:18.922 --> 07:21.082
- the missing prisoner is Eric Maddox.
- Yeah.

07:21.106 --> 07:22.451
The guy is a serious repeat offender,

07:22.475 --> 07:23.903
almost all violent robberies.

07:23.927 --> 07:26.038
Last one was a smash-and-grab
at an Indian casino.

07:26.062 --> 07:28.312
Left three bystanders dead,
a dozen more injured.

07:28.336 --> 07:30.076
LAPD scooped up Maddox's crew

07:30.100 --> 07:31.410
when they busted him six months ago.

07:31.434 --> 07:32.912
So who'd he convince to spring him?

07:32.936 --> 07:35.131
They sure as hell weren't amateurs.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.604
Found this tossed in the bushes.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.431
It's an M72 light anti-tank weapon.

07:39.455 --> 07:41.470
- Got to be military, yeah?
- Serious firepower

07:41.494 --> 07:43.589
- just to free one man.
- Yeah. With Maddox's record,

07:43.613 --> 07:44.924
there's no way he's just looking

07:44.948 --> 07:46.258
- to ride off into the sunset.
- No.

07:46.282 --> 07:48.427
He's got new friends and big guns.

07:48.451 --> 07:49.536
We're gonna see him again.

07:51.454 --> 07:59.454
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:45.624 --> 08:46.655
Hey, Hondo.

08:46.679 --> 08:48.523
I spoke to the warden up at CSP.
He's gonna send us

08:48.547 --> 08:50.242
all of Maddox's prison records.
All right.

08:50.266 --> 08:51.860
Well, if Maddox was involved
in planning this breakout,

08:51.884 --> 08:53.695
maybe we can figure out
who he was communicating with.

08:53.719 --> 08:55.080
How'd physical therapy go this morning?

08:55.104 --> 08:57.699
Oh, it was, uh, you know, fine.
I just got to keep at it.

08:57.723 --> 08:59.534
Not sure how else to convince the captain

08:59.558 --> 09:01.086
- I'm ready for full duty.
- I hope it's soon.

09:01.110 --> 09:02.537
We miss you, man.

09:02.561 --> 09:04.089
And with Mumford's
50-David spot opening up,

09:04.113 --> 09:06.041
we need you at full strength, bro.

09:06.065 --> 09:08.043
No, Deac's got nothing
to worry about there.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.544
Gentlemen, I want you to meet...

09:09.568 --> 09:10.985
Hondo.

09:14.073 --> 09:15.217
Ruiz.

09:15.241 --> 09:16.718
- You two go back?
- Yeah.

09:16.742 --> 09:19.054
Yeah, we served together
in Somalia. Same unit.

09:19.501 --> 09:20.722
Master Sergeant Ruiz

09:20.746 --> 09:22.774
has been sent up from Camp Pendleton.

09:22.798 --> 09:25.060
The serial number on the rocket
launcher from this morning

09:25.084 --> 09:27.229
traced back to their armory.

09:27.253 --> 09:28.234
Master Sergeant, huh?

09:28.259 --> 09:30.065
- That's no small deal.
- What about you?

09:30.089 --> 09:33.452
LAPD now, huh? A SWAT officer, no less.

09:33.848 --> 09:35.237
When did that happen?

09:35.261 --> 09:36.405
Been a minute.

09:36.851 --> 09:38.407
Hondo's been 20-David team leader

09:38.431 --> 09:39.541
for over a year now.

09:40.137 --> 09:41.239
So, you got any idea

09:41.263 --> 09:43.378
how an anti-tank weapon
could've slipped off the base?

09:43.402 --> 09:45.314
I'm just beginning my investigation.

09:45.338 --> 09:47.473
We're doing a full inventory,
see if anything else is missing.

09:47.497 --> 09:49.134
We can't rule out
that there might be a Marine

09:49.158 --> 09:50.636
- on Maddox's crew.
- True. But the weapon

09:50.660 --> 09:52.638
could have also been stolen
off a supply caravan,

09:52.662 --> 09:53.972
black-marketed somehow.

09:53.996 --> 09:55.424
We'll be investigating all options

09:55.448 --> 09:56.925
in conjunction with the Marines.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.833
Looking forward to
working with you, Hondo.

10:04.173 --> 10:06.768
I mean, I knew Champ was sick, I just,

10:06.792 --> 10:08.883
I didn't realize it was this bad.

10:09.428 --> 10:12.157
Been so busy the last month,
I didn't even visit.

10:12.637 --> 10:14.715
I just kept thinking things
would turn around.

10:26.651 --> 10:28.623
We'll leave you two alone, okay?

10:29.237 --> 10:30.564
Come on, girls.

10:34.537 --> 10:35.964
Wait, no. It's okay.

10:38.994 --> 10:40.410
Hey.

10:49.168 --> 10:51.635
It's crazy,
he used to be just pure muscle.

10:56.058 --> 10:59.154
Once, we were on this narcotics sweep,

10:59.178 --> 11:02.729
and the suspect was hiding under
the floor, high on something.

11:04.365 --> 11:06.065
Champ sniffed him out.

11:10.778 --> 11:12.155
We got back to the car,

11:14.157 --> 11:16.326
he showed me his leg was all cut up.

11:20.788 --> 11:24.563
He waited until the job
was done so I wouldn't fuss.

11:24.806 --> 11:26.711
Sounds like a real hero.

11:29.425 --> 11:31.520
I wouldn't have even been
considered for SWAT

11:31.544 --> 11:33.009
if it weren't for you.

11:36.971 --> 11:39.015
You always made me look so good.

11:40.058 --> 11:41.863
But it was all your doing, wasn't it?

11:44.437 --> 11:48.733
Without you, I was just faking it.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.711
We've been going over
Maddox's prison records.

11:56.735 --> 11:58.346
Turns out, he had a recent visitor.

11:58.370 --> 12:00.048
A woman. She showed up
to see him five times

12:00.072 --> 12:02.350
in the last four weeks,
probably planning his breakout.

12:02.374 --> 12:03.935
Prison visitors have to sign in.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.887
- We have a name?
- Yes, Lea Walker.

12:05.911 --> 12:07.389
- Hmm, doesn't ring any bells.
- Not clear how she ties

12:07.413 --> 12:09.274
to Maddox; she has no criminal record.

12:09.298 --> 12:11.016
Might only be because
she's never been caught.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.278
If she's got a legit reason for
spending so much time with Maddox,

12:13.302 --> 12:14.896
I want to hear it from her.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.947
This is ridiculous.

12:15.971 --> 12:17.732
You can't just haul me in here

12:17.756 --> 12:18.900
and hold me against my will.

12:18.924 --> 12:20.307
This one's a real peach.

12:21.927 --> 12:24.678
I want to talk
to whoever's in charge, now.

12:26.982 --> 12:28.877
Lucky for you, I'm right here.

12:28.901 --> 12:31.079
And I'll get straight to
the point. Where's Maddox?

12:31.103 --> 12:33.215
- Where's who?
- You know exactly who.

12:33.239 --> 12:35.217
Your prison boyfriend, Eric Maddox.

12:35.241 --> 12:36.918
I swear, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:36.942 --> 12:38.490
- You're Lea Walker, correct?
- Yeah,

12:38.514 --> 12:40.952
but I've never heard
of anyone named Maddox.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.312
This isn't the woman who
visited Maddox in prison.

12:47.336 --> 12:49.919
It looks like her, but it's not her.

12:52.338 --> 12:55.270
Ms. Walker, did you
lend anyone your I.D.?

12:55.633 --> 12:57.989
- A girlfriend, maybe?
- What? No, of course not.

12:58.013 --> 13:00.075
'Cause somebody used it
to visit a man in prison.

13:00.099 --> 13:01.827
Do you have any idea how
that might have happened?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.079
Probably that bitch who stole my purse.

13:04.103 --> 13:05.280
She got everything,

13:05.304 --> 13:06.615
including my driver's license.

13:06.639 --> 13:08.450
- Okay, when was that?
- Couple months ago.

13:08.474 --> 13:09.784
You said it was a woman who stole it.

13:09.808 --> 13:11.837
- Did you see her?
- Not when it happened, no.

13:11.861 --> 13:13.788
But the restaurant let me
watch their security tapes.

13:13.812 --> 13:16.625
You could see her,
plain as day, grab my bag

13:16.649 --> 13:19.294
and waltz out the door.
I filed a police report,

13:19.318 --> 13:21.463
but I guess a stolen purse
isn't exactly high priority.

13:21.487 --> 13:24.182
- Well, it's high priority now.
- Let's pull the report.

13:24.206 --> 13:25.517
If this purse snatcher
is the link to Maddox,

13:25.541 --> 13:26.790
- we need to find her.
- Right.

13:31.213 --> 13:33.191
Exactly what you asked for.

13:33.215 --> 13:34.809
The latest issue, full auto.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.583
- And the tear gas?
- Next crate.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.950
Of course, none of it means
anything without the real prize.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.891
Hmm.

13:45.728 --> 13:48.123
Packed more of a punch than we thought.

13:48.147 --> 13:49.562
Glad you only got scraped up.

13:53.149 --> 13:55.130
Must be pretty badass
to fire one of these.

13:55.154 --> 13:57.332
When we do the job, it'll be all you.

13:57.945 --> 14:00.502
Looks like we're about ready now.

14:02.528 --> 14:04.222
There she is, right over there.

14:04.246 --> 14:05.340
Thanks.

14:05.364 --> 14:06.558
Mm-hmm.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.728
Ty. What are you doing here?

14:09.752 --> 14:10.979
Is everything okay with Kira?

14:11.003 --> 14:12.147
Yeah, Kira's fine.

14:12.171 --> 14:14.566
- W-What about you?
- What? Why?

14:14.590 --> 14:16.851
You didn't show up to lunch, you
haven't picked up your phone since.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.070
- I've been calling.
- Things have just been busy.

14:19.094 --> 14:20.405
For after work, too?

14:20.429 --> 14:22.574
Kira said you bailed
on tonight in a text.

14:22.598 --> 14:24.526
- It's not like you, Chris.
- Is everything okay here?

14:24.550 --> 14:25.911
Yeah, everything's fine. This is, uh, Ty.

14:25.935 --> 14:27.662
Ty, this is Jim Street.

14:27.686 --> 14:30.031
- Ty. Sorry, man.
- Jim.

14:30.055 --> 14:32.500
I guess I'm just a little overprotective,

14:32.524 --> 14:34.669
- with everything going on.
- What do you mean? What's going on?

14:34.693 --> 14:37.027
Nothing. Just, with Chris's
dog dying and everything.

14:39.698 --> 14:41.042
Your dog is dying?

14:41.066 --> 14:43.700
We... we didn't even know you had a dog.

14:45.037 --> 14:47.048
He's my former K9 partner.

14:47.452 --> 14:50.253
I'll tell you and Kira
about it later, okay?

14:56.456 --> 14:57.565
What are we looking at?

14:57.589 --> 14:59.110
We got ahold of the
restaurant security video

14:59.134 --> 15:01.112
showing Lea Walker's purse being stolen.

15:01.136 --> 15:03.448
Shows the theft, but there's
really not much else to go on.

15:03.472 --> 15:05.650
But this just came in...
it's from the market next door.

15:05.674 --> 15:07.786
They share the same parking
lot as the restaurant.

15:07.810 --> 15:09.571
There. Isn't that her?

15:09.595 --> 15:11.122
This is definitely the same woman

15:11.146 --> 15:13.229
we saw visiting Maddox in prison.

15:13.983 --> 15:15.126
Gotcha.

15:15.150 --> 15:16.733
I'll run the plate.

15:17.536 --> 15:19.914
Name is Grace Fetter. Got an
address in North Hollywood.

15:19.938 --> 15:22.133
Base armory just completed
their inventory.

15:22.157 --> 15:24.052
They're missing three more M72s

15:24.076 --> 15:27.088
along with a half dozen M4A1 carbines

15:27.535 --> 15:29.725
and a tear gas crowd suppression kit.

15:29.749 --> 15:31.426
You still want to tell me
it was an outsider

15:31.450 --> 15:33.979
- who took all of that?
- You're right.

15:34.003 --> 15:36.097
It's got to be a Marine
that armed this crew,

15:36.121 --> 15:38.653
which is why I alerted our
Criminal Investigative Division.

15:38.677 --> 15:40.235
They're on their way up
to take over the case.

15:40.259 --> 15:41.581
The hell they are.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.738
This started with SWAT;
SWAT's gonna finish it.

15:43.762 --> 15:45.940
Since when are you a guy that
sees the mission through?

15:45.964 --> 15:47.776
We've got a possible location

15:47.800 --> 15:48.943
for Maddox right now.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.945
CID will never get a unit here in time.

15:50.969 --> 15:53.448
Fine. I'll go along,
as CID's representative.

15:53.472 --> 15:56.084
- We don't need you.
- I hear your team's down a man.

15:56.108 --> 15:58.691
Very least, I'm an extra pair of hands.

15:59.478 --> 16:00.626
He's right, Hondo.

16:00.650 --> 16:03.613
And it'll save me
the politics with Marine CID.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.265
You know, Somalia was 20 years ago.

16:10.289 --> 16:12.300
At some point, you got to let it go.

16:12.324 --> 16:13.852
Your brothers needed you.

16:13.876 --> 16:15.470
You walked out without a second thought.

16:15.494 --> 16:17.972
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:17.996 --> 16:19.253
We rollin' or what?

16:31.343 --> 16:33.143
Command to 20-David.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.094
Hondo, looks like we got some bad intel.

16:35.118 --> 16:36.541
Drone did a fly over the target.

16:36.565 --> 16:38.626
It looks like there are several
structures behind the house

16:38.650 --> 16:39.994
that weren't on the blueprints we pulled.

16:40.018 --> 16:41.212
Must be un-permitted construction

16:41.236 --> 16:42.436
the city didn't know about.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.666
So we'll improvise on the fly
like we're trained to do.

16:44.690 --> 16:46.167
Fill the gaps!

16:46.191 --> 16:47.406
Stay liquid!

16:57.601 --> 16:59.101
It's open.

17:00.205 --> 17:01.349
Give me two. Give me two.

17:01.373 --> 17:02.350
Go.

17:02.374 --> 17:03.657
Left side clear.

17:14.185 --> 17:16.830
Hey, Maddox's jumpsuit.
We're in the right place.

17:16.855 --> 17:19.032
House is clear. Let's sweep the back.

17:19.057 --> 17:21.035
Tough watching from the sidelines.

17:21.059 --> 17:22.670
Welcome to my world.

17:22.694 --> 17:24.372
I don't know how you do it.

17:24.396 --> 17:26.590
I put my trust in the team.

17:27.028 --> 17:30.229
Don't worry, you'll be back
in the field soon enough.

17:39.411 --> 17:41.389
Looks like a garage or a workshop.

17:41.413 --> 17:42.690
Luca, Chris, left side.

17:42.714 --> 17:44.297
Tan and Street with me. Move, move.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.186
Left side clear.

17:52.424 --> 17:55.056
Workshop's clear. No sign
of Maddox or Grace Fetter.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.321
Code 4. Look around and see

17:56.345 --> 17:57.409
what they might have left behind.

17:57.433 --> 18:00.347
Hondo. Master Sergeant.

18:01.934 --> 18:03.040
Luca.

18:08.935 --> 18:09.943
Empty.

18:09.968 --> 18:11.549
Hondo, something I need you to see.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.929
Aw. Can't be.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.636
You know him?

18:22.660 --> 18:23.752
Yeah.

18:24.143 --> 18:25.650
Scott Nestor. Corporal.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.709
I guess we found the
Marine who was arming them.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.111
Ah, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

18:36.135 --> 18:38.580
Hey, according to the detective,
Grace Fetter lives here

18:38.604 --> 18:40.582
with her longtime boyfriend, Jonah Holt.

18:40.606 --> 18:43.085
Matches the description of
our other prison bus attacker.

18:43.109 --> 18:44.419
- Yeah.
- Looks like they had

18:44.443 --> 18:46.088
two more people bunked
in their back room.

18:46.112 --> 18:48.841
They're probably building a crew for
whatever heist they're planning.

18:48.865 --> 18:50.459
There's nothing in here that indicates

18:50.483 --> 18:52.461
- what their next target is?
- Nah. As far as that goes,

18:52.485 --> 18:54.129
they cleaned up like
they knew we were coming.

18:54.153 --> 18:55.964
They left nothing to tip their hand.
The only thing

18:55.988 --> 18:58.496
we know for sure is that
they're loaded for bear.

18:59.955 --> 19:01.270
Is it weird he didn't do more

19:01.294 --> 19:02.855
to try and hide the soldier's body?

19:02.879 --> 19:04.606
No, it just confirms
what we already know.

19:04.630 --> 19:06.108
These guys don't give a damn

19:06.132 --> 19:07.643
about the wreckage
they leave in their wake.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.144
My guess is, whatever the target,

19:09.168 --> 19:10.883
they plan on making a score
and disappearing.

19:11.337 --> 19:14.483
Still can't figure how Corporal
Nestor was involved in all this.

19:14.507 --> 19:17.452
I knew the kid... he was as
squared away as they come.

19:17.476 --> 19:19.980
Decorated after two tours in Afghanistan

19:20.004 --> 19:22.824
- and about to ship out on his third.
- Everybody's got a weak spot.

19:22.848 --> 19:24.493
They must have found his somehow.

19:24.517 --> 19:26.399
Hondo, might have an answer.

19:27.236 --> 19:28.964
That's Nestor's family.

19:28.988 --> 19:30.832
The tech found e-mails.
Looks like they, uh, threatened

19:30.856 --> 19:33.502
to kill his kids if he
didn't deliver on the weapons.

19:34.031 --> 19:36.338
We'll get these guys, Ruiz.

19:36.362 --> 19:37.673
We'll see.

19:37.697 --> 19:38.953
Hey.

19:39.498 --> 19:40.893
I might be SWAT now,

19:40.917 --> 19:42.344
but semper fi still runs
through my veins.

19:42.368 --> 19:44.513
I don't take the murder of a young Marine

19:44.537 --> 19:46.515
- any lighter than you do.
- Yeah?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.517
Prove it, then.

19:48.541 --> 19:50.874
Go find these bastards.

19:58.384 --> 19:59.528
Come on.

20:00.057 --> 20:02.143
You can't really be mad at me.

20:02.977 --> 20:05.417
I didn't need you to go
messing in my personal life.

20:05.441 --> 20:07.252
I didn't mean to. I just figured

20:07.276 --> 20:09.421
- that Ty already knew about Champ.
- Well, he didn't.

20:09.445 --> 20:11.423
And now I have to explain
the whole thing to him and Kira,

20:11.447 --> 20:13.759
which is something I was hoping to avoid.

20:13.783 --> 20:16.929
Why? Isn't that what a relationship is?

20:16.953 --> 20:18.839
Isn't-isn't that why
you're with the two of 'em?

20:18.863 --> 20:20.882
You know what, forget it.
You just don't get it.

20:20.906 --> 20:23.602
I'm just saying, you're going
through something rough,

20:23.626 --> 20:25.220
and you're not wanting
to share it with them.

20:25.244 --> 20:27.004
That-that doesn't raise
a red flag for you?

20:27.028 --> 20:29.024
Oh, so now you're
the relationship expert?

20:29.048 --> 20:30.550
You're right. Okay, I'm alone.

20:30.574 --> 20:33.061
And I'm-I'm a mess when it
comes to my personal life.

20:33.085 --> 20:34.896
But if I ever did find someone,

20:34.920 --> 20:36.398
let alone two someones,

20:36.422 --> 20:38.233
I sure as hell wouldn't want
to be keeping something

20:38.257 --> 20:39.638
like this from them.

20:40.092 --> 20:43.071
I just don't get why you
wouldn't tell them this.

20:43.095 --> 20:45.429
Well, maybe that's just who I am, okay?

20:47.146 --> 20:49.316
Or maybe you're just not
in the right relationship.

20:56.826 --> 20:59.471
So, these are the two
who ambushed the prison bus.

20:59.495 --> 21:01.139
Yeah. Grace Fetter and Jonah Holt.

21:01.163 --> 21:02.808
Turns out Maddox and Holt are cousins.

21:02.832 --> 21:04.393
Explains how they tie together.

21:04.417 --> 21:05.927
Holt here has got a rap sheet
of his own...

21:05.951 --> 21:08.256
burglary, GTA... but this is
definitely a step up for him.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.537
Yeah, blackmailing and
murdering a Marine.

21:14.627 --> 21:16.318
Does his family know yet?

21:16.342 --> 21:19.303
Ruiz is with the body, arranging
notification for the wife.

21:19.465 --> 21:22.277
The way you and Ruiz
butt heads, I can't imagine

21:22.301 --> 21:24.663
how you served four years together.

21:25.142 --> 21:26.615
Actually, back then, we were tight.

21:26.639 --> 21:27.783
Whole unit was.

21:27.807 --> 21:29.284
So what happened?

21:29.308 --> 21:30.752
When my enlistment ended, I didn't re-up.

21:30.776 --> 21:32.120
I was one-and-done,

21:32.144 --> 21:34.456
and that didn't sit well
with a career guy like Ruiz.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.891
You ever explain to him
why you didn't reenlist?

21:36.915 --> 21:38.844
I didn't think I owed him an explanation.

21:38.868 --> 21:41.285
That's so Hondo. You know that.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.135
Found something interesting.

21:47.159 --> 21:48.520
As far as we can tell,

21:48.544 --> 21:50.639
Grace and Jonah have been
together since high school.

21:50.663 --> 21:52.641
Which makes me wonder
why she recently created

21:52.665 --> 21:54.192
an online dating profile and,

21:54.216 --> 21:56.278
over the last month, went
on four dates with this guy,

21:56.302 --> 21:58.313
- Lloyd Williams.
- Okay, I don't mean

21:58.337 --> 22:00.115
to throw shade,
but old SquarePants here doesn't

22:00.139 --> 22:01.483
really look like Grace's type.

22:01.507 --> 22:03.485
Makes me think she
wanted something from him.

22:03.509 --> 22:04.653
- Who is he?
- His dating profile's limited.

22:04.677 --> 22:06.488
Best I can tell, he's an office drone

22:06.512 --> 22:07.721
at some home mortgage company.

22:07.745 --> 22:09.374
All right, take Luca. Go check him out.

22:09.398 --> 22:10.604
Yep.

22:16.610 --> 22:18.800
Hey. Look at this.

22:18.824 --> 22:20.669
- One of your favorites?
- I don't know.

22:20.693 --> 22:23.004
It's probably the only food truck in L.A.
I haven't tried yet.

22:23.028 --> 22:24.577
Maybe after.

22:25.581 --> 22:28.176
Maybe now. Isn't that our
guy in line right there?

22:28.479 --> 22:29.812
Lloyd Williams!

22:30.669 --> 22:32.703
LAPD! Stop right there, Lloyd!

22:38.544 --> 22:40.072
Really? Okay.

22:40.096 --> 22:41.323
Excuse me.

22:49.310 --> 22:50.999
Hey. Hey, come on.

22:51.023 --> 22:52.834
Okay, look, look,

22:52.858 --> 22:55.370
I didn't know what she wanted. I swear.

22:55.394 --> 22:56.755
Didn't know what who wanted?
You talking about Grace?

22:56.779 --> 22:57.978
Why don't you take it easy,

22:58.002 --> 23:00.008
tell us the whole story, okay?

23:00.032 --> 23:01.710
I met her on this dating app,

23:01.734 --> 23:03.712
and she was... hot.

23:03.736 --> 23:05.514
So we-we went on a few dates.

23:05.538 --> 23:07.516
And she was really interested in my job,

23:07.540 --> 23:10.503
which was nice, because no one's
ever interested in my job.

23:10.527 --> 23:12.053
But then I realized
that was the only thing

23:12.077 --> 23:13.772
she was interested in.

23:13.796 --> 23:15.440
So I told her I was done.

23:15.464 --> 23:17.726
And that's when she said
she would pay me for the info.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.444
- What kind of info?
- Anything I had.

23:19.468 --> 23:22.230
Blueprints, details on security
systems, guard rotations.

23:22.254 --> 23:24.232
So they plan on robbing
a mortgage company?

23:24.256 --> 23:26.437
Oh, God, no.
I just started working there.

23:26.461 --> 23:28.120
I-I had another job before.

23:28.144 --> 23:29.738
But after I told her everything,

23:29.762 --> 23:31.293
I figured I should put in my notice.

23:31.317 --> 23:32.874
What are you talking
about, Lloyd? What job?

23:32.898 --> 23:34.075
Huh? Where did you work?

23:34.521 --> 23:36.878
The cash processing center
for the Federal Reserve.

23:37.733 --> 23:38.797
Next time, Lloyd,

23:38.821 --> 23:40.248
maybe start with that.

23:40.272 --> 23:41.750
The L.A. Federal Reserve branch

23:41.774 --> 23:44.136
is the second largest
cash reserve in the country.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.138
They won't officially say,
but they got to have

23:46.162 --> 23:48.702
at least $100-$150 million in there.

23:49.081 --> 23:50.809
Talked to the Federal
Reserve security chief.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.310
He didn't want to disclose anything

23:52.334 --> 23:54.312
about their schedules
or security measures.

23:54.336 --> 23:56.648
Yeah, but then you told him
about the M72 rockets.

23:56.672 --> 23:58.650
Yeah, and, suddenly, he opened up.

23:58.674 --> 24:01.269
They have a new cash shipment
arriving by armored car

24:01.293 --> 24:02.771
in less than an hour.

24:02.795 --> 24:04.156
I'll notify Ruiz.

24:04.180 --> 24:05.991
Luca and Tan are already en route.

24:06.015 --> 24:07.742
All right, we'll meet 'em there.

24:07.766 --> 24:10.017
Hey, Deac, you good to be our wheelman?

24:12.184 --> 24:13.448
Fine, but that's all.

24:13.472 --> 24:14.616
Don't push it.

24:15.232 --> 24:16.531
Let's roll.

24:19.144 --> 24:21.957
- 25-David to 20-David.
- This is 20-David, go.

24:21.981 --> 24:25.126
I'm looking at the info Lloyd
handed over to Maddox's crew.

24:25.150 --> 24:27.312
There's nothing in here to suggest
they're going after armored cars.

24:27.336 --> 24:29.297
Seems like they got their eyes
on the bigger prize.

24:29.321 --> 24:31.633
- The Federal Reserve itself.
- Well, that'd be nuts.

24:31.657 --> 24:33.101
The Federal Reserve is a fortress.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.686
No way they're getting in there,
even with those weapons.

24:34.710 --> 24:36.137
Doesn't mean they won't try.

24:47.261 --> 24:48.617
Chris?

24:48.641 --> 24:49.756
Chris, what's going on?

24:53.512 --> 24:55.762
It's Champ. He's gone.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.447
Just caught me by surprise, boss.

25:03.072 --> 25:04.549
It won't affect my game.

25:04.945 --> 25:06.321
I'm fine.

25:42.552 --> 25:44.113
20-David to Command.

25:44.137 --> 25:45.581
We're on scene at the Federal Reserve.

25:45.605 --> 25:47.333
No sign of Maddox yet.

25:47.821 --> 25:49.668
Luca, Street, scout the two-side,

25:49.692 --> 25:51.337
see where these guys might be vulnerable.

25:51.361 --> 25:53.038
Chris, you and Tan do
the same thing on the four.

25:53.062 --> 25:55.040
Hey, appreciate you guys
feeling like we need a hand,

25:55.064 --> 25:56.375
but it looks like a false alarm.

25:56.399 --> 25:58.377
Trust me, be happy if it is,
but I don't think so.

25:58.401 --> 26:00.045
The new currency all got here
without incident.

26:00.069 --> 26:02.047
And once the doors shut,
there's just no way in,

26:02.071 --> 26:03.432
even if these guys had a tank.

26:03.456 --> 26:05.551
24-David, the four-side looks secure.

26:05.575 --> 26:07.887
26-David, same on the two-side.

26:07.911 --> 26:09.221
No sign of Maddox.

26:09.245 --> 26:10.389
Something's not right.

26:10.413 --> 26:11.557
Like I said, false alarm.

26:11.581 --> 26:13.225
The unfit currency made
its transport as well,

26:13.249 --> 26:15.189
arrived at the shredding
facility without a problem.

26:15.213 --> 26:16.896
Wait a minute. Unfit currency.
What are we talking about?

26:16.920 --> 26:18.063
Economics 101.

26:18.087 --> 26:19.865
All right, Professor,
why don't you fill us in?

26:20.604 --> 26:22.568
For every new dollar
we put into circulation,

26:22.592 --> 26:24.370
a worn-out dollar has to come out.

26:24.394 --> 26:26.572
If we didn't do that, we'd be
flooding the country with cash,

26:26.596 --> 26:27.740
devaluing the currency.

26:27.764 --> 26:29.200
Worn-out bills.

26:29.224 --> 26:30.409
Impossible to trace.

26:30.433 --> 26:32.244
So, these unfit bills get destroyed, how?

26:32.268 --> 26:33.913
- Where?
- In a shredder.

26:33.937 --> 26:35.714
Here, usually. But our
machines were 30 years old.

26:35.738 --> 26:37.416
They're being replaced.
So, for the last five weeks,

26:37.440 --> 26:38.870
we've been doing all
the shredding off-site.

26:38.894 --> 26:40.221
How much was in today's shipment?

26:40.245 --> 26:41.387
I'm really not supposed to say.

26:41.411 --> 26:42.471
How much?

26:42.495 --> 26:44.306
Give or take, $35 million.

26:44.962 --> 26:46.592
But I told you, it got there just fine.

26:46.616 --> 26:48.093
Deacon, round 'em up.

26:48.117 --> 26:49.762
This is 20-David to Command.

26:49.786 --> 26:51.146
- Go ahead, Hondo.
- Captain, I don't think

26:51.170 --> 26:52.765
he's targeting the Federal Reserve.

26:52.789 --> 26:54.316
He's going after
an off-site shredding facility

26:54.340 --> 26:55.601
where they destroy old bills.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.770
- We're rolling now.
- Ruiz.

26:57.794 --> 26:59.271
These guys killed one of my men.

26:59.295 --> 27:00.739
I just had to inform the family.

27:00.763 --> 27:02.301
I'm not gonna stand around
and do nothing.

27:02.325 --> 27:03.681
Wasn't asking you to.

27:16.362 --> 27:17.506
Go, go, go!

27:45.063 --> 27:46.590
Come on, let's do this.

27:58.688 --> 28:01.739
Gooch, you know the plan.
You guys keep us covered.

28:03.526 --> 28:05.170
Let's go.

28:21.711 --> 28:23.894
On the ground! Everybody down!

28:29.218 --> 28:31.990
These are fives and tens!
Where are the hundreds?!

28:32.014 --> 28:33.445
Over here!

28:51.707 --> 28:53.519
All right, we got two shooters,

28:53.543 --> 28:55.054
one in the three-opening,
one in the four.

28:55.078 --> 28:56.605
Everybody stay close for cover.

28:56.629 --> 28:57.890
- Be better with a full team.
- Deac, you're right,

28:57.914 --> 28:59.558
but not this time. You know the orders.

28:59.582 --> 29:00.859
Keep it locked down here. Get up there.

29:00.883 --> 29:02.061
Street, Chris, you're with me.

29:02.085 --> 29:03.862
We work the left flank. Tan, Luca,

29:03.886 --> 29:05.719
- keep 'em busy.
- Move, move. Go, go, go, go.

29:07.256 --> 29:08.506
Cover fire!

29:13.763 --> 29:15.429
Drop your weapons and come out!

29:18.267 --> 29:20.412
26-David, one suspect down!

29:28.411 --> 29:29.626
Cops are here.

29:33.950 --> 29:35.106
We got to move.

29:35.130 --> 29:37.373
Don't just stand there.
You've got guns. Use 'em!

29:40.256 --> 29:41.433
Two more!

29:41.457 --> 29:43.435
- Same opening!
- Hondo, Tan and me are going left!

29:43.459 --> 29:44.987
- Tan!
- On your two. Let's do it.

29:45.011 --> 29:46.210
Get in the car, Gooch!

29:53.136 --> 29:54.580
Suspect two down!

29:54.604 --> 29:55.970
It's no good, man. He's hit.

29:59.308 --> 30:01.392
Grace!

30:03.572 --> 30:04.953
Get up, now!

30:07.150 --> 30:09.628
- No, no, no.
- Shut up.

30:14.707 --> 30:15.968
What are you doing?

30:15.992 --> 30:17.686
Time to go, cut our losses.

30:17.710 --> 30:19.634
- What about Grace?
- What about her?

30:21.652 --> 30:23.018
Jonah, I'm not waiting.

30:26.669 --> 30:28.719
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

30:31.841 --> 30:32.818
Hondo, I can't get a clear shot!

30:32.842 --> 30:34.316
Mine's no good either!

30:43.853 --> 30:46.331
- Deac! You gotta pin him in!
- Roger that.

30:46.355 --> 30:48.747
Sorry, Luca. This might not be pretty.

31:02.537 --> 31:04.682
We can't let this guy get
anywhere near a populated area.

31:04.706 --> 31:06.851
I'm trying... this thing was
built for strength, not speed.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.519
This is 20-David, in pursuit.

31:08.543 --> 31:10.571
Westbound on Norwich approaching Glazer.

31:10.595 --> 31:12.925
- Any units in the area?
- Hondo, it's Ruiz.

31:12.949 --> 31:15.026
I'm just south of you.
If you force him my way,

31:15.050 --> 31:16.861
- maybe I can lay a strip.
- Roger that.

31:16.885 --> 31:18.029
What do you say, Deac?

31:18.053 --> 31:19.080
Do what I can.

31:57.759 --> 32:01.122
Deacon, these rockets, if they
burn up, they're gonna blow.

32:01.146 --> 32:02.729
Ruiz, let's go, let's go.

32:37.799 --> 32:39.493
Cover! Gun!

32:39.517 --> 32:41.184
Move, move, move!

32:46.357 --> 32:47.918
Remember your old training?

32:47.942 --> 32:50.309
Oorah. Move, move.

33:16.838 --> 33:18.699
You're outta road, Maddox.

33:18.723 --> 33:19.950
It's time to give yourself up.

33:19.974 --> 33:21.485
Don't do it.

33:21.509 --> 33:22.653
You're not gonna make it, man.

33:22.677 --> 33:23.821
You don't think I'm fast enough?

33:23.845 --> 33:25.790
As much as we'd both
like to see you try...

33:25.814 --> 33:27.764
It's over, Maddox. Let me see your hands.

33:39.956 --> 33:41.388
This is 20-David to Command.

33:41.412 --> 33:42.840
Final suspect in custody.

33:42.864 --> 33:44.247
We're Code 4.

33:56.344 --> 33:57.519
Take him.

33:58.546 --> 34:00.074
Move it.

34:00.098 --> 34:02.026
How many millions you think that is?

34:02.050 --> 34:05.485
Doesn't matter. It was all meant
to be destroyed anyway.

34:21.569 --> 34:25.549
Well, on behalf of the U.S. Marines,

34:26.214 --> 34:27.590
thank you.

34:28.842 --> 34:31.105
You run a pretty
impressive operation here.

34:31.129 --> 34:32.773
Clearly, you know how to command.

34:33.235 --> 34:35.485
Well, we both know where I got my start.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.145
Listen, Ruiz.

34:41.222 --> 34:43.398
Now, maybe 20 years is too long, but...

34:43.925 --> 34:46.570
we never talked about
my decision to not reenlist.

34:46.594 --> 34:48.873
I saw your commitment to your team.

34:49.529 --> 34:51.335
Had to wonder why it
wasn't that way with us.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.576
Ruiz.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.462
Look, it didn't have nothing to
do with you or the other guys.

34:55.485 --> 34:57.882
Do you remember that night raid in Merca?

34:57.906 --> 34:59.750
When we took out that rebel nest
that was sniping

34:59.774 --> 35:01.252
those Army guys from the 23rd?

35:01.276 --> 35:03.087
- Above the street market.
- That's right.

35:03.111 --> 35:04.755
We battered the hell out
of them with the 50s.

35:04.779 --> 35:07.391
When I went in on clean-up,
I saw one of them...

35:07.415 --> 35:09.093
A dead kid.

35:09.117 --> 35:10.895
He couldn't have been more than 15.

35:10.919 --> 35:12.263
That kid was firing on our troops.

35:12.287 --> 35:13.470
Granted.

35:14.172 --> 35:15.930
But, Ruiz, when I saw him...

35:16.791 --> 35:18.602
it took me back home to the kids

35:18.626 --> 35:20.487
from the streets of South L.A.

35:20.511 --> 35:23.824
Just another dead black teen
with a gun, man.

35:23.848 --> 35:25.609
And that's when I realized,

35:25.633 --> 35:27.278
if I really want to make
a change in this world,

35:27.302 --> 35:28.946
I gotta start in my own neighborhood,

35:28.970 --> 35:30.737
not some dirt street in Africa.

35:31.439 --> 35:33.139
That's what I did.

35:35.810 --> 35:37.535
Guess I can respect that.

35:42.317 --> 35:44.178
You shouldn't have had to wait 20 years

35:44.202 --> 35:46.294
for an explanation, and...

35:48.213 --> 35:49.739
that's on me.

35:51.659 --> 35:55.303
Some of the guys from the old
unit... we still get together.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.431
Maybe next time I'll hook you in.

36:00.058 --> 36:01.645
I'd like that.

36:01.669 --> 36:04.337
It'd be nice to see some
of the old faces again.

36:09.227 --> 36:10.321
Oorah.

36:10.345 --> 36:11.727
Oorah.

36:15.316 --> 36:16.827
Deac, man, what the hell?

36:16.851 --> 36:18.545
Captain just told us
that you pulled yourself

36:18.569 --> 36:20.130
from the running to be the new 50-David.

36:20.154 --> 36:21.298
That's right, I did.

36:21.322 --> 36:22.666
Injuries heal, man.

36:22.690 --> 36:23.940
It has nothing to do with my injuries.

36:25.708 --> 36:26.962
Well, what?

36:26.986 --> 36:28.505
Is it Annie and the kids?

36:28.529 --> 36:30.007
I mean, not being there for them enough?

36:30.031 --> 36:31.558
You'd probably have more time.

36:31.582 --> 36:33.293
With the pay bump, you wouldn't
need to moonlight anymore.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.346
Look, fellas. I all ready spoke
to the captain.

36:35.370 --> 36:36.680
It's a done deal;
let's just leave it at that.

36:36.704 --> 36:38.015
Yeah, but I don't get it, man.

36:38.039 --> 36:39.233
This is what you always wanted,

36:39.257 --> 36:40.481
to finally have your own team.

36:40.505 --> 36:41.683
Hey, guys.

36:42.176 --> 36:43.687
Give me a minute alone
with Deac, all right?

36:44.102 --> 36:45.845
- Of course.
- Yeah.

37:00.395 --> 37:01.978
I stole some money today.

37:03.924 --> 37:05.768
It was only for a minute, but...

37:06.457 --> 37:08.209
It was in my pocket.

37:09.037 --> 37:10.714
It was in my pocket

37:10.738 --> 37:13.464
before I threw it back
and watched it burn.

37:15.626 --> 37:17.554
But for a moment,

37:17.578 --> 37:19.679
I became someone I-I didn't know.

37:21.082 --> 37:23.600
Someone not worthy
of leading a SWAT team.

37:27.138 --> 37:29.272
That doesn't sound like the Deac I know.

37:30.398 --> 37:32.202
I don't know who I am right now.

37:32.567 --> 37:33.787
Why, man?

37:33.811 --> 37:35.511
What's going on with you?

37:37.151 --> 37:40.160
I'm in a financial hole. Deep.

37:40.185 --> 37:41.754
I thought you and Luca
already took care of that?

37:41.779 --> 37:42.791
We did.

37:42.816 --> 37:44.293
But that was before
the baby needed surgery.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.084
I know, I should have reached out.

37:47.108 --> 37:51.138
I-I was... stupid... ashamed.

37:51.162 --> 37:53.296
And I wanted to do it myself.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.146
Bottom line, I got involved
with a loan shark.

37:59.761 --> 38:01.598
Before I knew it,
he had his hooks into me

38:01.622 --> 38:03.431
for way more than money.

38:03.958 --> 38:05.569
You got to tell all this

38:06.059 --> 38:08.210
to Cortez and Hicks, I understand.

38:13.968 --> 38:15.151
Deacon...

38:15.550 --> 38:17.561
I'm not about to get you fired.

38:17.972 --> 38:19.950
I'm gonna get you some help.

38:19.974 --> 38:21.746
You're not gonna face this alone.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.754
Team is family.

38:23.778 --> 38:25.728
No man left behind.

38:30.368 --> 38:31.867
Thank you.

38:33.488 --> 38:34.704
But I don't know what to do.

38:34.728 --> 38:36.231
You're gonna tell me his name

38:36.255 --> 38:38.040
and exactly where I can find him.

38:41.629 --> 38:42.606
Hey.

38:42.630 --> 38:43.640
Hey.

38:43.664 --> 38:45.014
How you doing?

38:45.333 --> 38:47.611
You know. It hurts.

38:47.635 --> 38:49.363
Hold up.

38:49.727 --> 38:52.699
There's a reason I didn't tell
Ty and Kira about Champ.

38:52.723 --> 38:54.065
It's just...

38:54.809 --> 38:57.654
As cops, there are things that
happen on the job, you know?

38:57.678 --> 38:58.956
And...

38:59.320 --> 39:01.542
as much as I want to share,

39:01.566 --> 39:03.533
you just want to tell someone
who'll get it.

39:04.992 --> 39:06.744
That's why I shared it with you.

39:07.321 --> 39:08.882
And listen, um...

39:08.906 --> 39:11.509
I'm sorry about all
the stuff that I said.

39:11.533 --> 39:13.000
Don't be sorry.

39:13.494 --> 39:15.077
Maybe you're right.

39:21.035 --> 39:22.179
Help you guys?

39:22.203 --> 39:23.347
You Mickey?

39:23.371 --> 39:24.481
Yeah, that's right.

39:25.082 --> 39:26.138
What's this?

39:26.162 --> 39:28.352
That's the end of the story
between you and Sergeant Kay.

39:28.376 --> 39:29.570
And that plate you wanted to run?

39:29.594 --> 39:30.843
You can guess what you can do with that.

39:32.559 --> 39:34.954
I didn't ask for any of this.
Y-You know that, right?

39:35.099 --> 39:37.000
- He came to me.
- And then you took advantage.

39:37.024 --> 39:39.196
You're out of Deacon's life now,
Mickey, you got me?

39:39.220 --> 39:41.854
And you better make sure that
we don't come back into yours.

39:50.948 --> 39:52.915
Parade, rest!

40:07.882 --> 40:10.016
Attention!

40:45.786 --> 40:47.512
Good boy.
