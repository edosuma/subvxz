01:20.901 --> 01:25.334
( <i>slurred</i> ):
Loneliness, loneliness,
loneliness-- hmm!

01:25.367 --> 01:26.701
Miss Taxi Cab Driver,

01:26.734 --> 01:29.067
do you know where I spent
my afternoon?

01:29.100 --> 01:30.400
In a bar?

01:30.434 --> 01:31.901
I was in a bar.

01:31.934 --> 01:35.033
And do you... do you know
what I was doing?

01:35.067 --> 01:36.734
Drinking.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.734
I was drinking.

01:38.767 --> 01:41.367
You know... you know
what I was thinking about?

01:41.400 --> 01:42.767
Loneliness?

01:42.801 --> 01:43.901
You too, huh?

01:43.934 --> 01:44.934
( <i>laughing</i> )

01:44.968 --> 01:45.968
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

01:46.000 --> 01:47.601
Here we are.

01:49.434 --> 01:51.567
Uh, $7.50.

01:51.601 --> 01:53.567
Here. Just keep the change.

01:53.601 --> 01:54.901
Oh, thank you.

01:54.934 --> 01:56.067
Are you sure

01:56.100 --> 01:57.901
you can find
your plane?

01:57.934 --> 02:03.067
Listen, if I'm late,
they're going to wait for me.

02:09.234 --> 02:10.734
Whew.

02:16.534 --> 02:18.934
Park and 63rd, please.

02:18.968 --> 02:20.467
Okay.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.400
Oh...

02:28.267 --> 02:29.734
Excuse me, but, uh,

02:29.767 --> 02:32.300
does this
bring back any memories?

02:32.334 --> 02:34.434
Gimme an E!
Gimme an E!

02:34.467 --> 02:35.767
Gimme an A-S-T!

02:35.801 --> 02:37.267
BOTH:
Gimme an S! Gimme an S!

02:37.300 --> 02:38.734
Gimme an I-D-E!

02:38.767 --> 02:41.100
East Side, East Side!
Go, team, go!

02:41.133 --> 02:42.868
Yay!

02:42.901 --> 02:44.267
Never heard of it.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.868
( <i>screeching</i> )

02:47.767 --> 02:50.000
Elaine O'Connor.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.501
Mary Parker.

02:51.534 --> 02:53.100
I don't believe this.

02:53.133 --> 02:54.767
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

02:54.801 --> 02:56.434
It's amazing!

02:56.467 --> 02:58.200
After all these years.

02:58.234 --> 03:00.300
You know, I have thought of you
now and then

03:00.334 --> 03:02.767
trying to think
what you might be doing.

03:02.801 --> 03:05.033
Oh, how close
did you come to this?

03:05.067 --> 03:06.734
Not very.

03:06.767 --> 03:09.167
I must say,
I was a little startled

03:09.200 --> 03:12.167
to see our homecoming queen
driving a cab.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.300
Uh, Mary, uh, I wasn't
the homecoming queen.

03:15.334 --> 03:16.801
Oh, who was?

03:16.834 --> 03:18.133
You were.

03:18.167 --> 03:19.534
That's right.

03:22.067 --> 03:24.200
Weren't you something, Elaine?

03:24.234 --> 03:25.234
Oh, yes!

03:25.267 --> 03:26.701
I was, uh,
head cheerleader.

03:26.734 --> 03:27.901
Oh, that's right.

03:27.934 --> 03:30.100
And the lead
in the senior class play.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.901
Oh, that's right.
Mm-hmm.

03:31.934 --> 03:33.634
I remember--
I wasn't able to be

03:33.667 --> 03:34.634
in the senior class play

03:34.667 --> 03:36.334
because I was
too busy dating.

03:36.367 --> 03:38.701
( <i>laughing</i> )
( <i>forced laughter</i> )

03:38.734 --> 03:42.167
Oh, Elaine, we've got a lot
of catching up to do.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.100
Oh, yeah.
Tell me about yourself.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.100
Oh, no, no, no.
You go first.

03:46.133 --> 03:50.000
Okay. I, uh, own
a advertising agency.

03:50.033 --> 03:51.133
Mm!

03:51.167 --> 03:53.534
I own a co-op
in Manhattan.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.601
I take a month or so
in Europe every year.

03:56.634 --> 03:58.567
Oh, and I have
a steady fella.

03:58.601 --> 03:59.868
He's an international lawyer

03:59.901 --> 04:01.567
and we're really excited,
because right now,

04:01.601 --> 04:04.801
we're planning a trip
for next spring to China.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.601
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Oh!

04:06.634 --> 04:09.133
Maybe I should have gone first.

04:09.167 --> 04:10.901
Well, uh, besides this,

04:10.934 --> 04:14.334
I am a receptionist at
an uptown art gallery...

04:14.367 --> 04:15.734
Mm-hmm.

04:15.767 --> 04:16.834
...and, uh, I'm
a divorced mother

04:16.868 --> 04:18.166
of two beautiful
children...

04:18.200 --> 04:19.166
Mm-hmm.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.166
...and I, uh, uh...

04:20.200 --> 04:22.334
That's it.

04:22.367 --> 04:27.467
Well... regardless, you...
certainly look nice.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.434
( <i>laughing</i> )

04:29.467 --> 04:31.767
Uh, Mary, you don't have
to feel sorry for me.

04:31.801 --> 04:32.834
Sorry for you?!

04:32.868 --> 04:33.968
Because there's
no reason to.

04:34.000 --> 04:34.968
Well, I know that.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.234
Because I'm very happy.

04:36.267 --> 04:37.801
Oh, you certainly
seem very happy.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.934
Yes, well, I'm even
happier than I seem!

04:39.968 --> 04:41.300
Happier!

04:41.334 --> 04:43.567
Because, uh, you see,
I have a steady guy too.

04:43.601 --> 04:44.767
Oh, great.
Yeah.

04:44.801 --> 04:45.868
What's his name?

04:45.901 --> 04:49.033
Uh... it's,
uh... Billboard.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.067
Bill Board.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.067
Bill Board.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.400
( <i>laughs</i> )

04:52.434 --> 04:54.200
Well, tell me
about him, Elaine.

04:54.234 --> 04:55.200
What does he do?

04:55.234 --> 04:57.601
Uh, he's a professor
at Columbia.

04:57.634 --> 04:59.267
Oh?

04:59.300 --> 05:02.367
Must be brilliant.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.834
He is, and not
at all stuffy.

05:04.868 --> 05:06.701
He's, uh, he's
charming and witty,

05:06.734 --> 05:09.834
and, uh, he's also
the most romantic
man in the world.

05:09.868 --> 05:12.167
Oh, he sounds wonderful.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.200
He is.

05:13.234 --> 05:14.667
Oh, I have an idea.

05:14.701 --> 05:15.767
Why don't we all
get together

05:15.801 --> 05:17.567
for dinner tomorrow night,
the four of us.

05:17.601 --> 05:18.734
Oh-oh-oh, no, Mary.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.734
Uh, we're all tied up
till the weekend.

05:20.767 --> 05:22.634
Oh, I see, well,
perhaps another time.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.400
We'll play it by ear.

05:24.434 --> 05:26.901
Right. I would <i>love</i>
to meet your man.

05:26.934 --> 05:28.734
Me too.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.000
Hey, Elaine.
Hey.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.767
Hey, Elaine,
how you doing?

05:36.801 --> 05:38.100
Don't talk to me.

05:38.133 --> 05:39.834
I hate everything today.

05:39.868 --> 05:41.334
I mean, look at me.

05:41.367 --> 05:42.834
I'm a mess.

05:42.868 --> 05:44.167
Oh, yeah.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.334
BOBBY:
I hardly
even know you.

05:46.367 --> 05:48.868
You know, I was so depressed
when I woke up this morning,

05:48.901 --> 05:50.267
that I barely made it in here.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.601
I mean, I didn't feel
like doing anything.

05:52.634 --> 05:54.100
I swear to God,
I didn't even floss.

05:54.133 --> 05:55.434
( <i>gasping</i> )

05:55.467 --> 05:57.367
Come on, Elaine,
we're just kidding.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.534
ALEX:
Hey, come on, Elaine.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.534
Now, what got you
so down, huh?

06:00.567 --> 06:01.968
Oh, I don't know.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.701
It all started last night

06:03.734 --> 06:06.267
when I picked up
Mary Parker in my cab.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.434
Who's Mary Parker?

06:08.467 --> 06:10.834
Does she, have, uh...

06:10.868 --> 06:14.634
frizzy blonde hair,
granny glasses

06:14.667 --> 06:17.734
and smoke
French cigarettes?

06:17.767 --> 06:19.234
No.

06:19.267 --> 06:21.868
Well, if you run into
somebody like that,

06:21.901 --> 06:23.334
I'd like to meet her.

06:26.601 --> 06:29.801
Mary Parker is this girl
I went to high school with

06:29.834 --> 06:32.267
you know, that I haven't
seen for a long time.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.567
Well, she's beautiful,
she's rich, she's successful,

06:34.601 --> 06:36.067
she's dating
this great guy.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.434
So, here we were,

06:37.467 --> 06:39.501
sitting in my cab-- right?
--talking about our lives,

06:39.534 --> 06:41.400
and, uh, she has all this

06:41.434 --> 06:43.801
and the most exciting thing
that's happened to me

06:43.834 --> 06:44.901
is I bought this new cushion

06:44.934 --> 06:47.334
that keeps me
from sticking to the seat.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.000
Hey, you know, Elaine,
when you're a cab driver,

06:49.033 --> 06:50.234
you know, it's a little natural

06:50.267 --> 06:52.734
to occasionally run into someone
who's better off than you are.

06:52.767 --> 06:53.734
ELAINE:
Yeah, well...

06:53.767 --> 06:56.300
People you run over
are better off than you.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.267
See, you don't understand.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.801
What don't we under... What are
you talking about, Elaine?

07:00.834 --> 07:02.567
See, this isn't just somebody.

07:02.601 --> 07:04.067
I mean, this Mary and I

07:04.100 --> 07:06.434
were real competitors
in high school.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.868
Where can I get one of those?

07:10.868 --> 07:12.667
One of those what?

07:12.701 --> 07:13.968
One of those things

07:14.000 --> 07:16.634
to keep you from
sticking to your seat.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.801
I'll get you one, okay?

07:22.834 --> 07:23.701
Thanks.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.634
Anyway...

07:25.667 --> 07:28.868
seeing Mary again
just reminded me that I...

07:28.901 --> 07:33.033
that I once expected
more from myself, you know?

07:33.067 --> 07:36.567
See... I never told
you guys this before,

07:36.601 --> 07:38.200
but, in the yearbook,

07:38.234 --> 07:41.367
I was voted
"Most Likely to Succeed."

07:41.400 --> 07:42.901
You know, uh...

07:42.934 --> 07:45.300
I was voted "Most Talented."

07:45.334 --> 07:49.067
What obedience school
was that, Bobby?

07:49.100 --> 07:51.367
While we're patting ourselves
on the backs here,

07:51.400 --> 07:53.501
I had perfect attendance
my junior year

07:53.534 --> 07:56.167
and I was elected president
of the biology club.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.133
That's because
you could take your brains out

07:58.167 --> 08:00.167
and pass 'em around the room.

08:04.534 --> 08:05.901
Blue.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.501
Blue?

08:08.534 --> 08:13.200
I'd like a blue thing
to keep me from sticking.

08:13.234 --> 08:15.567
It's my favorite color.

08:15.601 --> 08:17.300
Right, Jim, right.

08:17.334 --> 08:18.300
Blue.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.734
Hey, Elaine, Elaine.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.167
Come on, Elaine.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.267
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.534
Now, come on.
Cheer up, huh?

08:24.567 --> 08:25.701
LATKA:
Now, wait a minute.

08:25.734 --> 08:28.701
Just a minute.

08:28.734 --> 08:32.366
There's only...
is one thing you need in life

08:32.400 --> 08:37.100
and to make... make you happy,
and that is friends.

08:40.433 --> 08:44.868
That's all you need is friends,
and then you be happy.

08:44.901 --> 08:47.200
Right, Latka.

08:47.234 --> 08:50.801
If you have friends,
you be happy... happy...

08:50.834 --> 08:52.501
happy person.

08:54.567 --> 09:00.667
You-you also need
the food and clothes.

09:00.701 --> 09:02.734
You need,
you need food and clothes

09:02.767 --> 09:06.100
and you need the friends
and the food and clothes,

09:06.133 --> 09:07.534
then you be happy person.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.033
ALEX:
Thank you.

09:09.067 --> 09:10.667
And a nice car.

09:12.701 --> 09:14.634
So, if you have

09:14.667 --> 09:18.434
friends and the food and clothes
and the nice car,

09:18.467 --> 09:20.434
it is all you need.

09:20.467 --> 09:23.334
You don't need
anything else.

09:23.367 --> 09:26.067
Except a home.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.467
You need the home.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.667
A nice house,
and when your friends

09:29.701 --> 09:31.934
come over to visit you,

09:31.968 --> 09:36.100
they might want to take a dip,
so you need the pool.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.667
So, let's add this up:

09:38.701 --> 09:42.334
You need the friends
and the food and clothes

09:42.367 --> 09:45.701
and the car
and the house with the pool.

09:50.167 --> 09:54.033
And a beautiful woman, uh,
who have a nice body

09:54.067 --> 09:58.367
that make you, uh,
foam, foaming at the mouth.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.200
And she will sit
by the pool

10:03.234 --> 10:04.834
in the bathing suit.

10:04.868 --> 10:06.868
That's all, you don't
need anything else.

10:06.901 --> 10:09.133
You need the friends

10:09.167 --> 10:10.801
the food and the clothes,
the car,

10:10.834 --> 10:13.100
the house with the pool,
the beautiful woman

10:13.133 --> 10:17.367
that make the... the foam
come out of the mouth...

10:17.400 --> 10:22.367
You know, as long as you have
the house with the pool,

10:22.400 --> 10:25.334
the car
and the beautiful woman...

10:25.367 --> 10:27.434
the friends would only
get in the way.

10:29.701 --> 10:31.234
Forget I said anything.

10:31.267 --> 10:33.734
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.567
Elaine, Elaine...

10:37.601 --> 10:39.834
See, see, I just can't
figure this out.

10:39.868 --> 10:41.701
I mean, it
doesn't add up.

10:41.734 --> 10:43.901
Why should all
this great stuff

10:43.934 --> 10:45.534
happen to Mary Parker?

10:45.567 --> 10:47.400
I mean, I'm
a nice person.

10:47.434 --> 10:49.734
I work hard.
Where's my reward?

10:49.767 --> 10:51.200
Elaine, Elaine,
you're not going to let this

10:51.234 --> 10:52.234
get you down
like this, are you?

10:52.267 --> 10:55.000
Oh, I'm trying not to,
Alex, but...

10:55.033 --> 10:56.701
Well, the worst
part of it

10:56.734 --> 10:58.367
is that Mary felt
sorry for me.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.501
Oh, she... she tried to
deny it, but I know she did.

11:02.534 --> 11:06.300
Well, I couldn't stand that,
so, uh, I started lying.

11:06.334 --> 11:09.334
Lying?! What'd you
lie about?

11:09.367 --> 11:11.267
Well, I couldn't
lie about my job,

11:11.300 --> 11:13.601
so, uh... I lied

11:13.634 --> 11:15.868
about having this
great steady guy.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.300
Oh...

11:17.334 --> 11:19.000
She kept pressuring
me to get together,

11:19.033 --> 11:20.033
so she could meet him.

11:20.067 --> 11:23.667
Ew... But I really,
really had to squirm

11:23.701 --> 11:25.534
to get out of it.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.701
Alex, I don't believe it.

11:27.734 --> 11:30.067
I'm ashamed
of my own life.

11:30.100 --> 11:34.467
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

11:36.100 --> 11:38.133
Sunshine Cab Co.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.200
Who? Yeah, she's here.

11:40.234 --> 11:42.200
Who may I say is calling?

11:42.234 --> 11:44.834
Oh. Hey, Elaine,
it's that Mary Parker.

11:44.868 --> 11:48.367
You know, the woman whose life
is so much better than yours.

11:50.667 --> 11:53.467
( <i>perky</i> ):
Hi!

11:53.501 --> 11:58.100
Yeah. Uh, it was great
seeing you last night, too, Mar.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.701
Oh, yeah, it's a shame, I know,

12:00.734 --> 12:04.300
but we're all tied up
through the weekend.

12:04.334 --> 12:06.267
Uh, next week? Uh, no.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.167
Next week, we're going

12:08.200 --> 12:10.334
out of town
for the whole week.

12:10.367 --> 12:13.801
Oh, yeah,
and the week after...

12:13.834 --> 12:17.934
Uh... Mary...

12:17.968 --> 12:20.567
I have a little confession
to make. Um...

12:20.601 --> 12:23.000
No, no, no,
just give me a chance

12:23.033 --> 12:24.734
to say this

12:24.767 --> 12:26.534
'cause it's kind of hard. I...

12:26.567 --> 12:28.234
Hello, Mary, uh,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

12:28.267 --> 12:29.434
I'd just like
to say hello.

12:29.467 --> 12:32.167
Hello.
( <i>laughing</i> )

12:32.200 --> 12:34.400
Oh, who am I? I'm Elaine's guy.

12:37.868 --> 12:39.868
What do you say?
You want to get together?

12:39.901 --> 12:41.901
How about Saturday night?

12:41.934 --> 12:43.567
Fine. Great.

12:43.601 --> 12:45.234
It will be a pleasure.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.501
Okay. Can't wait
for it. Bye.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.000
Hmm?

12:49.033 --> 12:52.100
Alex, I appreciate
what you're trying to do

12:52.133 --> 12:55.467
but you don't know
what you got yourself into.

12:57.767 --> 13:00.434
Alex, that was great.

13:00.467 --> 13:01.834
You really think so?

13:01.868 --> 13:05.467
Yeah. Now...

13:05.501 --> 13:08.300
if they can just
invent something

13:08.334 --> 13:11.701
to keep me from sticking
to my shorts.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.934
Bill Board?

13:34.968 --> 13:41.334
Hey, you came this close
to being Karmen Ghia.

13:41.367 --> 13:43.467
Look, the important thing
is that we just relax

13:43.501 --> 13:44.767
and have a good time, right?

13:44.801 --> 13:46.901
And that
we're not pitied.

13:46.934 --> 13:47.934
Elaine, damn it.

13:47.968 --> 13:49.567
I don't want to hear
any more talk like that.

13:49.601 --> 13:51.334
Now, no one's going
to pity you tonight.

13:51.367 --> 13:52.434
Okay.

13:52.467 --> 13:53.801
You told your friend Mary

13:53.834 --> 13:56.234
that you had a guy
that was crazy about you?

13:56.267 --> 13:58.901
You're going to have a guy
who's crazy about you--

13:58.934 --> 14:01.100
who will worship
the ground you walk on.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.767
Okay. May I have
a glass of water?

14:03.801 --> 14:05.534
What's the matter?
Your arm's broken?

14:07.033 --> 14:08.801
All right, all right,
all right.

14:08.834 --> 14:11.267
Hello.

14:11.300 --> 14:12.434
Mary!

14:12.467 --> 14:14.767
Hi. Mary,
this is Bill Board.

14:14.801 --> 14:15.767
Hello.

14:15.801 --> 14:16.667
Bill,
this is Mary Parker.

14:16.701 --> 14:17.601
How do you do?
Hi, there.

14:17.634 --> 14:18.667
And this is
Michael Edwards.

14:18.701 --> 14:19.667
ELAINE:
Hello.

14:19.701 --> 14:21.501
Elaine Nardo
and Bill Board.

14:21.534 --> 14:23.000
How do you do?
Hi.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.167
Why don't
you two sit down?

14:25.200 --> 14:26.634
Yes, sure.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.434
ELAINE:
You look lovely.

14:30.467 --> 14:31.934
MARY:
OH, thank you.

14:33.534 --> 14:35.067
MAITRE D':
Would you care

14:35.100 --> 14:36.367
for cocktails?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.133
Uh, martini up,
please.

14:38.167 --> 14:39.634
MICHAEL:
That sounds good.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.100
Bill, why don't you
order for us.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.434
All right.

14:42.467 --> 14:43.434
I think we'll start

14:43.467 --> 14:45.133
with a bottle
of your finest champagne.

14:45.167 --> 14:46.934
Yes, sir.

14:46.968 --> 14:50.000
It's kind of an
anniversary for us.

14:50.033 --> 14:52.534
It was nighttime
when we met.

14:52.567 --> 14:53.534
Same.

14:53.567 --> 14:55.701
That's sweet.

14:55.734 --> 14:58.300
MICHAEL:
That's a very
unusual name-- Bill Board.

14:58.334 --> 14:59.367
Yeah.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.701
I'm sure you get
a lot of kidding.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.200
Well, I don't have
as much trouble

15:04.234 --> 15:07.033
as my two brothers:
Clip and Switch.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.968
Madame, sir.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.968
Our very finest.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.300
Thank you.

15:20.334 --> 15:21.834
Oh, remember, darling?

15:23.834 --> 15:25.467
Thank you.

15:25.501 --> 15:26.634
Well...
Well...

15:26.667 --> 15:28.033
Here's to old friends.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.701
And to new ones.

15:29.734 --> 15:31.133
And to Elaine.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.501
Good martini.

15:36.534 --> 15:37.767
Not bad.

15:37.801 --> 15:39.767
But you know
where they make

15:39.801 --> 15:41.734
the best martinis
in the world?

15:41.767 --> 15:44.534
This little bar in Hong Kong
called Cecil's.

15:44.567 --> 15:46.534
Have you
ever been there?

15:46.567 --> 15:49.067
No. We don't really
travel very much.

15:49.100 --> 15:50.901
Oh, we do.

15:50.934 --> 15:53.601
Well, you know, as
a matter of fact, uh,

15:53.634 --> 15:56.200
we don't really need
to go places.

15:56.234 --> 15:58.000
I mean, we have
our entire world

15:58.033 --> 16:00.133
right here
in New York City.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.167
I mean,
we have each other.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.701
Well,
we don't travel

16:03.734 --> 16:06.000
as much as we used to.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.300
A cab driver
and a college professor.

16:12.334 --> 16:15.100
How did you two meet?

16:15.133 --> 16:16.801
How did we meet?

16:16.834 --> 16:18.133
Well, uh...

16:18.167 --> 16:19.634
Yes, well, you know,

16:19.667 --> 16:22.267
actually, it's a very
interesting story.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.234
Well, actually,
I was browsing

16:24.267 --> 16:26.968
in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art one day

16:27.000 --> 16:28.334
and, uh, I came upon

16:28.367 --> 16:30.300
the most exquisite
work of art

16:30.334 --> 16:32.033
I've ever seen
in my life.

16:32.067 --> 16:34.033
I mean,
I couldn't take

16:34.067 --> 16:35.701
my eyes off her.

16:35.734 --> 16:39.801
I just stood there,
stunned.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.033
By the time
I was able to speak,

16:41.067 --> 16:42.367
well, it was too late.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.067
She vanished.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.567
So, I went home
and tried to forget her

16:47.601 --> 16:51.033
but I just couldn't
get her out of my mind.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.400
So I found myself,
the next Saturday afternoon,

16:53.434 --> 16:56.300
right back there
at the museum.

16:56.334 --> 16:58.267
I started spending
all of my spare time

16:58.300 --> 16:59.634
in museums
all over the city,

16:59.667 --> 17:02.667
just on the one chance
in a million

17:02.701 --> 17:04.767
that I would get
to see her again.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.200
How long
did this go on?

17:07.233 --> 17:08.467
What?

17:08.501 --> 17:10.800
How long
did this go on?

17:10.834 --> 17:14.000
Oh, two, three years.

17:18.334 --> 17:20.000
Three years?

17:20.032 --> 17:22.467
Yeah. Time had lost
all meaning.

17:22.501 --> 17:23.834
And then, one day--

17:23.867 --> 17:26.133
I remember,
it was a Thursday--

17:26.166 --> 17:29.100
I'd spent the entire day
at the museum

17:29.133 --> 17:31.834
and I decided,
oh, well, that's it.

17:31.868 --> 17:33.467
It had been a dream.

17:33.501 --> 17:35.868
I imagined
the whole thing.

17:35.901 --> 17:38.267
So I went out
to the street

17:38.300 --> 17:40.934
and I remember
it was raining.

17:40.968 --> 17:42.334
I hailed a cab.

17:42.367 --> 17:45.501
And guess who
was driving that cab.

17:45.534 --> 17:46.801
Me?

17:50.801 --> 17:52.701
That's incredible.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.901
So I finally got
the opportunity to say

17:54.934 --> 17:57.501
what I'd been waiting
to say for three years--

17:57.534 --> 17:59.367
that I couldn't live
without her.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.968
That's lovely.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.300
Oh, that's lovely.

18:06.334 --> 18:09.167
So, uh, where did
you two meet?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.234
We were sunbathing
on a beach

18:11.267 --> 18:12.834
in the Mediterranean.

18:12.868 --> 18:14.467
Cannes.

18:14.501 --> 18:15.968
I don't think it
was Cannes, dear.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.300
Where was it?

18:17.334 --> 18:19.300
It was Nice. I've
never been to Cannes.

18:19.334 --> 18:20.234
Well, dear, it doesn't
really matter.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.501
It was a beach,
right?

18:21.534 --> 18:22.834
Yes, dear, it
was a beach, but...

18:22.868 --> 18:24.267
ALEX:
When Elaine and I met,

18:24.300 --> 18:26.734
I'd become the
perfectly happy man

18:26.767 --> 18:29.267
and she's the most
wonderful person

18:29.300 --> 18:31.133
I've ever met in my life.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.467
And, every day,

18:32.501 --> 18:34.968
she makes me more
certain of that fact.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.968
Would you like
to order now?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.033
Yes.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.334
I'd like one of him.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.267
Bill?

18:50.300 --> 18:51.601
Yes, darling?

18:51.634 --> 18:54.167
Do you think you could
let go of my hand,

18:54.200 --> 18:55.968
so I could cut my meat?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.100
Oh.

18:58.133 --> 19:02.434
Well, I guess
you have to eat.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.501
I'll give it right back.

19:04.534 --> 19:05.834
Promise?

19:05.868 --> 19:07.100
Okay.

19:10.868 --> 19:13.067
( <i>chuckling</i> )

19:13.100 --> 19:15.701
We know we're silly,
but I don't know...

19:15.734 --> 19:17.300
whenever we get together,

19:17.334 --> 19:19.400
you know, we just have
this strange habit

19:19.434 --> 19:22.133
of forgetting
everybody else in the room.

19:22.167 --> 19:25.501
Uh, so, how do you get along
with Elaine's children, Bill?

19:25.534 --> 19:27.234
Oh, I love her children.
I love them.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.701
And Elaine
is a wonderful mother.

19:29.734 --> 19:32.400
Surprise, surprise.

19:32.434 --> 19:34.267
You know,
as a matter of fact,

19:34.300 --> 19:36.534
one of my favorite
children's stories

19:36.567 --> 19:38.400
is about Elaine's
son, Jason.

19:38.434 --> 19:39.834
Do you mind, darling?

19:39.868 --> 19:41.300
No. Not at all.

19:41.334 --> 19:42.467
Okay.

19:42.501 --> 19:44.167
Um, Elaine had told Jason

19:44.200 --> 19:46.501
that God answers
all your prayers.

19:46.534 --> 19:48.934
So, one night,
before he went to bed,

19:48.968 --> 19:52.133
Jason prayed to God
and asked for a train set.

19:52.167 --> 19:54.067
Well, the next day,
he came to Elaine

19:54.100 --> 19:56.400
and he said he'd prayed
for a train set

19:56.434 --> 19:57.734
and didn't get one.

19:57.767 --> 19:59.901
And Elaine
was very worried.

19:59.934 --> 20:02.434
And she said,
"I'm sorry, Jason,

20:02.467 --> 20:05.067
that God didn't answer
your prayers."

20:05.100 --> 20:06.400
And Jason said,

20:06.434 --> 20:09.667
"Oh, but he did answer
my prayers, Mommy.

20:09.701 --> 20:11.067
He just said no."

20:11.100 --> 20:14.467
That was
two or three years ago.

20:14.501 --> 20:16.067
I know, darling.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.801
I didn't remember
that story.

20:17.834 --> 20:18.968
How did you remember it?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.033
I remember everything.

20:22.067 --> 20:24.767
( <i>slow dance music playing</i> )

20:26.868 --> 20:28.167
Oh, listen.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.067
They're playing
our song.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.467
May I have this dance?

20:36.501 --> 20:37.801
Of course.

20:37.834 --> 20:39.334
Would you excuse us?

20:39.367 --> 20:41.901
Excuse us, please.

21:03.334 --> 21:06.434
Would you care to dance?

21:06.467 --> 21:11.067
Why don't we wait
until they play our song?

21:13.067 --> 21:15.567
What is our song,
dear?

21:15.601 --> 21:19.400
We don't have one.

21:26.968 --> 21:28.367
Boy, we did it.
We did it.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.467
We were wonderful,
Elaine, wonderful.

21:30.501 --> 21:32.667
They bought it
hook, line, and sinker.

21:32.701 --> 21:34.400
You know, I was
a little worried at first

21:34.434 --> 21:35.701
that our act
wasn't convincing,

21:35.734 --> 21:37.834
but boy, I'm telling you,
you were something else.

21:37.868 --> 21:39.334
Okay, Alex.
Huh?

21:39.367 --> 21:41.534
Come on.
What do you mean,
come on? What?

21:41.567 --> 21:43.167
Come on, you can
admit that it was

21:43.200 --> 21:44.901
a little more
than an act.

21:44.934 --> 21:45.901
What are you talking about?

21:45.934 --> 21:47.033
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:47.067 --> 21:47.868
What are you talking about?

21:47.901 --> 21:49.367
You're not that good an actor.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.367
What?!

21:50.400 --> 21:51.701
Alex, it's okay.

21:51.734 --> 21:55.400
You can confess
that you were a little moved.

21:57.167 --> 21:58.534
( <i>anxious laughter</i> )

21:58.567 --> 22:00.367
( <i>laughs</i> )

22:00.400 --> 22:02.100
Elaine, I hate
to disillusion you,

22:02.133 --> 22:04.434
but all that drivel I did
was for your sake,

22:04.467 --> 22:05.501
and your sake only.

22:05.534 --> 22:07.000
Drivel?!
Oh, Alex, be honest!

22:07.033 --> 22:08.200
What?
Come on!

22:08.234 --> 22:09.400
I saw that look
on your face.

22:09.434 --> 22:12.868
I know that that look
means... you were excited.

22:12.901 --> 22:14.300
Oh..!

22:14.334 --> 22:16.033
Get out... You're crazy!

22:16.067 --> 22:17.200
You were.

22:17.234 --> 22:18.434
I was not!

22:18.467 --> 22:19.767
Alex, you were.

22:19.801 --> 22:21.200
Come on. How can you
stand there and pretend

22:21.234 --> 22:23.400
that you didn't
feel anything?

22:23.434 --> 22:24.167
How can you lie
like that?

22:24.200 --> 22:25.267
Elaine, what are
you talking about?

22:25.300 --> 22:27.300
You were crazy
about me.

22:27.334 --> 22:29.434
I'm the most exquisite
work of art

22:29.467 --> 22:31.400
you've ever seen
in your life!

22:31.434 --> 22:34.634
Oh, that!
No, I'd say that to anybody!

22:34.667 --> 22:36.167
Oh, Alex, come on.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.634
I've been out with enough men

22:38.667 --> 22:41.400
to know that no man
can get me...

22:41.434 --> 22:44.601
excited like that
if he's just acting.

22:44.634 --> 22:46.501
When we were kissing,

22:46.534 --> 22:48.601
you weren't turned on?

22:48.634 --> 22:50.501
I was playing a part.

22:50.534 --> 22:52.367
Oh, here, I'll show you.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.801
Here, I'll do it again.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.100
See? Nothing.

22:58.133 --> 22:59.267
Nothing?

22:59.300 --> 23:00.467
Nothing.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.234
( <i>in squeaky voice:</i> )
Nothing.

23:25.501 --> 23:28.334
Oh, really?

23:28.367 --> 23:30.334
( <i>in squeaky voice:</i> )
Nothing.

23:30.367 --> 23:35.267
Well... I guess
I was wrong.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.801
Good night, Alex.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.901
( <i>in squeaky voice:</i> )
See you.

23:42.167 --> 23:44.000
Good night.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.868
( <i>in squeaky voice:</i> )
Well, I better go now.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.334
It was nothing.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.133
Nothing.

24:02.934 --> 24:06.234
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:29.934 --> 24:31.501
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.
