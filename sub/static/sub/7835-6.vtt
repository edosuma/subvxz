01:22.833 --> 01:26.836
We now return to The
Planet from Outer Space.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.846
Captain, we've been attacked
by some sort of force ray.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.933
Space air is flooding in.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.145
Right. Goggles on!

01:58.076 --> 02:02.663
Good Lord! We're on a collision
course with a monster from space!

02:07.795 --> 02:10.253
That's just a dog in a spacesuit!

02:10.339 --> 02:12.715
From the looks of it, a male dog.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.761
We'll return to our film
after these very loud messages.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.932
Hi. I'm Colonel Chet Manners,
five-time space shuttle alternate.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.141
Loser.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.644
Do you want to boldly
go where people like me,

02:24.728 --> 02:27.146
but not me, have gone before?

02:27.231 --> 02:31.275
Then get the Orbit King, with yaw
control like you've never seen.

02:33.237 --> 02:38.324
Hey, Lise, is Dad's credit
card number 5784365343410709?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.909
You know it is.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.457
When you have a rib-eye
steak You must floss it

02:46.542 --> 02:48.292
Oh, that meatloaf tasted great

02:48.377 --> 02:49.502
You must floss it

02:49.586 --> 02:51.838
Now floss it, floss it good

02:51.922 --> 02:54.048
Hey, Dad, will you help
me build this model rocket?

02:54.132 --> 02:57.552
Just a second, Son. I
gotta put on my contacts.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.104
I didn't know your dad was
so interested in science.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.522
Science?

03:09.606 --> 03:10.982
He didn't say "science. "

03:11.066 --> 03:13.150
He said "pie pants. "

03:13.443 --> 03:16.237
Mmm. Pie pants.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.161
This is launch master
Homer counting down,

03:24.246 --> 03:26.789
five, four, three...

03:31.795 --> 03:35.131
My eyebrows! My beautiful eyebrows!

03:35.716 --> 03:37.466
Over here, guvnor.

03:40.304 --> 03:44.015
The word "unblowupable" is
thrown around a lot these days,

03:44.099 --> 03:46.475
but I think I can say with confidence...

03:48.604 --> 03:51.939
Okay, that shows you what
could potentially happen.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.027
What was that?

03:56.111 --> 03:59.739
Greetings from Neddedy Space
Center on Cape Flandaveral.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.534
We noticed your "sky-rotechnics"
and thought we'd join in.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.411
Ooh, looks like a perfect landing.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.460
Wow! Did you see that yaw control?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.545
I have eyes, don't I?

04:20.177 --> 04:23.012
I would really like to thank
you nerds for helping me out.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.765
And could you stop calling us "nerds"?

04:25.849 --> 04:28.517
"Dweeb," "wonk," "spaz. " It's all good.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.103
Who wants some astro-lemonade?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.189
What precisely makes it astro?

04:33.273 --> 04:36.567
Look, I don't want to start
a whole thing with this.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.654
Okay, the rocket's ready to go.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.952
Super. Now if you'll gather
round, I'd like to say a few words.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.371
All nerds clear the launch area!

04:48.872 --> 04:50.081
Let's wait in the car.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.958
Now, all we need is our astronaut.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.961
Bart, where's America's newest hero?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.379
He's saying goodbye to his wife.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.176
He's leaving her with five babies.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.220
She already ate three.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.930
That's sensible.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.202
Son, we are about to break
the surly bonds of gravity

05:28.286 --> 05:31.038
and punch the face of God!

05:33.208 --> 05:36.961
Five, four, three, two, one,

05:37.379 --> 05:38.462
countdown!

06:04.656 --> 06:08.284
Wow! That's it. I'm off the hooch.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.537
Hey, wine!

06:17.919 --> 06:20.129
Dad, the rocket's off course!

06:20.547 --> 06:22.673
Okay, Nibbles. You can guide her down.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.468
"Step one, right in front
of you is a blue handle.

06:25.552 --> 06:29.138
"Pull for a controlled
burn of 2.4 seconds. "

06:38.982 --> 06:40.858
Now it's heading for the church!

06:40.942 --> 06:43.277
Don't worry. I planned for this.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.587
This is the worst
thing you've ever done!

07:01.671 --> 07:04.757
You say that so much,
it's lost all meaning.

07:11.056 --> 07:15.226
I have convened the church council
to see what we should do now.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.062
Fixing this church should
be our top priority.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.440
And I say that as a teenager,
and the parent of a teenager.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.360
Fixing all that damage is
gonna be very expensive.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.446
Yes, barring some sort of miracle...

07:29.699 --> 07:33.494
All right! We'll help
ourselves, yet again.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.788
People, we need some fundraising ideas.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.832
Let's just write to David Bowie again.

07:37.916 --> 07:41.168
No, he's done enough for
this church. Anyone else?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.422
I've got the answer.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.467
Just let me run this
church like a business.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.136
It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns,

07:50.220 --> 07:53.305
but the buzz around town
is that you're, well, evil.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.724
That's just a skip-rope rhyme.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.978
Believe me, the Lord's gonna
go for this in a big way.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.896
Now, who's with me?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.941
I guess we have no choice.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.317
Excellent.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.530
You'll get yours.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.116
This is Lindsay Naegle.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.326
And don't let the skirt fool you.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.871
She'll have this place
making money in no time.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.248
Isn't that skirt a
little north of the knee?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.000
You're telling me.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.003
I guarantee I can find
some new revenue streams.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.505
Step one, let's sell some ad space.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.425
Reverend, how would you
feel about wearing this robe?

08:30.969 --> 08:32.178
Conflicted.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.139
Too bad! You've already signed the deal!

08:35.222 --> 08:36.599
Actually, he hasn't.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.144
Well, we highly value your input,

08:40.687 --> 08:42.897
until you sign the deal.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.523
Let me handle this, Monty.

08:44.608 --> 08:45.691
Good idea.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.568
I'll be hiding behind that tree.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.661
What are they doing to the church?

08:57.746 --> 08:58.954
We're re-branding it.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.998
The old church was skewing pious.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.292
We prefer a faith-based emporium,

09:03.376 --> 09:05.502
teeming with impulse-buy items.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.296
I feel like I want to throw up.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.881
Then my work is done.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.052
Why does Jesus have a lasso?

09:13.136 --> 09:14.845
Because he's all man.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.941
Money changed.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.944
Get your money changed,
right here in the temple!

09:30.612 --> 09:33.113
That could not be more blasphemous.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.324
Where's Bart?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.250
Do a nice one for Grandma.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.626
Fine.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.006
These new pews are so comfy.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.176
I am not going to be
taken in by all of this.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.845
Lisa, don't sulk.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.514
You're on the JumboTron.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.477
Adorable.

10:03.561 --> 10:07.022
And Lord, please remember
our infirm parishioners,

10:07.357 --> 10:11.568
especially Mrs. Glick, who's
recovering from hip surgery.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.364
And now, let us rise and... Um...

10:16.283 --> 10:17.491
Um...

10:17.742 --> 10:18.951
He's not gonna say it.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.538
Trust me. He'll say it, or I'll bust
him down to Thursday night vespers.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.790
...and thank Crazy Larry

10:24.874 --> 10:28.544
whose big-screen TV prices are insane!

10:30.046 --> 10:33.132
And now, to deliver a special sermon

10:33.216 --> 10:37.011
on the sanctity of
deliciousness, the Noid.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.182
That's it!

10:43.393 --> 10:47.521
Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in
the store is looking at you.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.648
They should take a
good look at themselves

10:49.733 --> 10:51.567
and what their church has become!

10:52.736 --> 10:54.903
Lisa, it's still the same basic message.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.822
We've just dressed it up a little.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.741
Like the Whore of Babylon?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.951
That is a false analogy.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.495
No, it's not. It's apt. Apt!

11:05.081 --> 11:07.875
Don't you see what Mr. Burns
has done to this church?

11:07.959 --> 11:11.003
He restored it from nave to narthex!

11:11.087 --> 11:14.381
He super-sized the pews
for the zaftig believers.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.216
He put ice in the urinals.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.010
Those are all wonderful things,

11:18.094 --> 11:20.179
but they've cost the church its soul.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.057
And I, for one, will
not be a part of it!

11:26.269 --> 11:29.355
Do you want your hand stamped
so you can come back in?

11:29.439 --> 11:32.274
No! I'm leaving this church forever!

11:35.195 --> 11:37.112
Oh, no!

11:37.447 --> 11:38.822
I don't know how to feel.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.824
You should be very upset.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.159
Got it.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.413
How is that? A little much.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.506
Lord, I'm not turning my back on you.

11:55.590 --> 11:59.218
I just need to find a temple
that's free of corruption.

11:59.302 --> 12:03.263
Why do you have to be so different?

12:03.348 --> 12:08.143
Always making a big
deal out of everything?

12:11.314 --> 12:13.524
Mom, I know it's you.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.860
I can't believe you're
eavesdropping on my prayers.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.738
Honey, I'm worried about your soul.

12:20.031 --> 12:24.201
I want at least one person from
this family to go to heaven.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.911
I still believe in God.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.872
I just think there's
another path to him or her.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.124
Her?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.168
She's just kidding, Mr. Lord.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.758
Still looking for a new faith? Yeah.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.928
Hey, how about one of those
religions where you eat a human heart?

12:43.012 --> 12:44.012
No.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.180
How about Methodist?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.432
No!

12:46.516 --> 12:49.935
Look, I'm not just gonna pick
a religion that seems cool.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.271
I'm gonna pick one that's right for me.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.357
How about Judaism? When
you turn 13, cha-ching!

12:55.442 --> 12:57.443
I'm going out for a walk.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.633
Lenny and Carl? You guys are Buddhists?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.427
Yeah. If I didn't have inner peace,

13:23.511 --> 13:26.638
I'd completely go psycho on
all you guys all the time.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.474
Well, I'm looking for a new faith,

13:28.558 --> 13:30.726
one that isn't so materialistic.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.061
Well, you've come to the right place.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.107
Buddhism teaches that
suffering is caused by desire.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.693
Richard Gere?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.237
The world's most famous Buddhist.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.698
What about the Dalai Lama? Who?

13:44.782 --> 13:46.658
You know, the 14th reincarnation

13:46.743 --> 13:48.785
of the Buddha Avalokiteshvara.

13:48.870 --> 13:49.912
Who's Buddha?

13:49.996 --> 13:52.122
It's a good thing Buddhism
teaches freedom from desire,

13:52.207 --> 13:53.999
'cause I've got the
desire to kick your ass.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.169
Mr. Gere, I was hoping Buddhism
could bring me inner peace.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.754
Or is that just a pipe dream?

13:58.838 --> 14:02.174
We all have dreams.
Mine is of a free Tibet.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.592
That would be so great.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.302
I dream about meatball sandwiches,

14:05.428 --> 14:07.095
all-you-can-eat
for two bucks.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.180
Good luck.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.557
This pamphlet contains the
teachings of the Buddha.

14:10.642 --> 14:14.269
"All things are impermanent, and
are empty of inherent existence. "

14:14.854 --> 14:16.980
Hey, Richard, in An
Officer and a Gentleman,

14:17.065 --> 14:18.732
did you really do all those sit-ups?

14:18.816 --> 14:22.027
I wish. I did one, and they
just showed it 1,000 times.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.949
"Nirvana is achieved through
right views and right speech.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.992
"Positive actions lead to happiness

14:29.077 --> 14:31.995
"and negative actions
lead to unhappiness.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.791
"No creator gods, just the
pursuit of enlightenment. "

14:36.292 --> 14:38.377
I'm a Buddhist!

14:39.462 --> 14:41.713
Hey, I'm a Buddhist!

14:42.549 --> 14:44.633
My Satan-sense is tingling.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.593
Into the root cellar, boys!

14:46.678 --> 14:48.220
When can we come out?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.680
Maybe never.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.348
Yay! Yay!

14:56.521 --> 14:59.356
So, you think you know
better than this family, huh?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.525
Well, as long as you're in my house,

15:01.609 --> 15:04.319
you'll do what I do and
believe what I believe.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.113
So, butter your bacon!

15:06.197 --> 15:07.614
Yes, Father.

15:10.952 --> 15:14.246
Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.249
Hold that thought. Bacon
up that sausage, boy.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.626
But, Dad, my heart hurts.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.800
I'm a Buddhist.

15:26.884 --> 15:27.926
What?

15:28.011 --> 15:30.429
That's it. No more chat rooms for you!

15:30.513 --> 15:32.055
You know, Lisa,

15:32.140 --> 15:33.724
around here, Buddhists don't get

15:33.808 --> 15:35.767
any desserts in their lunches.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.769
A Buddhist wouldn't want any.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.652
Hey, Simpson, I hear your
sister dumped Christianity.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.778
Who cares?

15:46.863 --> 15:48.822
I'll tell you someone who cares.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.617
He's got long hair,
works as a carpenter,

15:51.701 --> 15:55.162
has a lot of crazy ideas
about love and brotherhood.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.040
His name's Gunnar,
and he's dating my mom.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.000
Sometimes, he buys us beer.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.044
I thought Kearney was dating your mom.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.129
Hey, she came on to me!

16:04.213 --> 16:05.631
Get him!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.848
Hey, Lisa. What are you doing?

16:14.932 --> 16:16.933
I'm planting my own Bodhi Tree.

16:17.018 --> 16:20.562
If I meditate under it,
perhaps I can find inner peace.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.775
Honey, is this about some boy
at school who doesn't like you?

16:24.859 --> 16:25.817
No!

16:25.902 --> 16:26.985
Good!

16:27.570 --> 16:29.988
I'm just saying that any
boy who doesn't like you

16:30.073 --> 16:31.740
is not worth your time.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.581
You're gonna get a bath tonight!

16:43.169 --> 16:47.881
So, the good news is church
revenues are up 1,073%.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.218
And when will the church
see any of this money?

16:51.302 --> 16:53.637
When hell freezes over, suckers!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.270
Whatever. Just take it.

17:05.483 --> 17:09.069
Well, next on our agenda,
Marge Simpson's devil daughter.

17:09.153 --> 17:13.156
She's not a devil. I just
don't know what to do.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.282
Well, Christmas is coming, huh?

17:15.367 --> 17:19.121
Yeah. And Santa doesn't leave
presents under the Bodhi Tree.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.873
You think we can bribe
her back with Christmas?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.583
Marge, you can save more souls

17:23.667 --> 17:25.544
with roller skates and Easy-Bake Ovens

17:25.627 --> 17:28.630
than with this
2,000-page sleeping pill.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.593
Time to begin

17:33.678 --> 17:37.806
Operation X-Mas Remind of How Good Is.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.268
Just do it! Do it! Do it now!

17:42.061 --> 17:44.396
I think this tree could use an angel.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.690
Well, at least it's tasteful.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.908
I was just making Christmas cookies.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.161
But since you don't believe
in Christmas anymore,

17:59.245 --> 18:00.746
I guess you don't want any.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.123
Well, they do smell good.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.333
It's a pity.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.503
All right! Trash cookies!

18:10.298 --> 18:11.882
Uh-oh.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.550
I think I ate a dog food lid.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.058
Here she comes!

18:22.143 --> 18:24.352
And a-one, and
a-two, and a...

18:24.520 --> 18:29.107
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas

18:29.192 --> 18:30.609
We wish... We wish...

18:31.194 --> 18:32.277
Hello, Lisa.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.030
I just came down for a glass of water.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.492
Well, you do have a
present under the tree.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.495
I guess no one told
Santa you were a Buddhist.

18:41.579 --> 18:45.957
Well, Santa can take it back
because I'm not ruled by material...

18:46.042 --> 18:48.710
Is that a pony?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.339
I don't know what Santa left you.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.967
I just know his name is
Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.344
Lisa, we love you,

18:57.428 --> 19:00.972
and we're not trying to
put any pressure on you.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.897
Aw.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.027
Lick it. Lick it.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.154
No!

19:18.074 --> 19:22.285
Oh, no! Our daughter's
run away on Christmas Eve!

19:24.247 --> 19:25.997
More sugar, please.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.165
Bag's in the kitchen.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.542
All right!

19:34.549 --> 19:37.425
My family tried to trick me
into celebrating Christmas.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.511
You know, we are meditating.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.682
Oh. Sorry. That's all right.

19:43.766 --> 19:47.519
I was only about to achieve
enlightenment. But who'd want that?

19:47.603 --> 19:49.855
Who likes short-shorts?

19:49.939 --> 19:52.190
I like short-shorts.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.317
Those guys are way off.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.945
Anyway, your family
didn't have to trick you.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.573
Buddhists respect the
diversity of other religions

19:59.657 --> 20:01.741
as long as they're based
on love and compassion.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.703
It's true. So, why don't you go home?

20:04.787 --> 20:06.454
I'm sure your family really misses you.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.874
I can really celebrate Christmas?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.542
You can celebrate any holiday.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.211
And, you know, my birthday is August 31.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.422
Oh. I'll send you an
e-mail greeting card.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.548
Sweet.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.800
Now I really should be
getting back to my family.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.052
Yeah. I'm spending tonight
with my step-daughter, Hannah.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.013
I do her hair, then she does mine.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.181
We're gonna go spend Christmas with Moe,

20:25.266 --> 20:27.809
you know, so he don't have one
of his Christmas "accidents. "

20:27.894 --> 20:30.478
Hey, he can't do much without this.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.441
I did it! I found our dog!

20:34.525 --> 20:36.651
Now our Christmas is complete!

20:36.736 --> 20:39.029
We were looking for Lisa!

20:39.113 --> 20:41.323
I thought we were caroling.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.450
We better call the police.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.370
Lisa?

20:48.164 --> 20:50.165
You came back!

20:52.001 --> 20:53.001
Yeah.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.670
I wanted to spend
Christmas with you guys.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.505
So, you're back on the winning team?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.257
No, I'm still Buddhist.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.676
But I can worship with my family, too.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.763
So, you're just going to pay
lip service to our church?

21:04.847 --> 21:05.889
Uh-huh.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.099
That's all I ever asked.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.644
Well, I'm just glad you're back.

21:12.188 --> 21:16.107
And don't worry, honey. I'll
pray double hard for both of us.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.027
Now let's get you
some Christmas cookies.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.570
Thanks, Mom.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.907
Hey, where's my pony?

21:23.991 --> 21:27.369
Yes! Merry Christmas to us all!

21:28.245 --> 21:30.163
I'm serious. Make with the pony.

21:30.247 --> 21:33.458
And a happy and healthy New Year!

21:33.751 --> 21:35.877
Here, Clip-Clop!
Here, pony-pony!

21:35.962 --> 21:38.046
Happy, happy New Year!
