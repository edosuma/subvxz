00:00.320 --> 00:03.854
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.277 --> 00:06.814
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:06.881 --> 00:09.249
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.317 --> 00:11.919
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:11.986 --> 00:14.287
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.355 --> 00:16.222
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.291 --> 00:19.453
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.521 --> 00:22.088
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:23.689
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:23.757 --> 00:25.324
Should we shoot them?

00:25.392 --> 00:27.894
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.962 --> 00:30.296
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.800
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.867 --> 00:35.001
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help,</i>
<i>michael.</i>

00:35.069 --> 00:37.503
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.571 --> 00:39.170
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.109 --> 00:48.112
<i>As a spy, you try to work</i>
<i>only with an experienced team.</i>

00:48.180 --> 00:49.680
<i>Going into the field</i>

00:49.748 --> 00:51.648
<i>with someone who doesn't have</i>
<i>the proper training</i>

00:51.716 --> 00:52.983
<i>is a recipe for disaster.</i>

00:53.051 --> 00:54.418
<i>There are times, though,</i>

00:54.486 --> 00:56.453
<i>when having a civilian</i>
<i>on an operation</i>

00:56.521 --> 00:57.721
<i>is unavoidable.</i>

00:57.789 --> 00:59.988
You want me to help you
rob a bank?

01:00.056 --> 01:02.490
<i>In those situations, you just</i>
<i>have to make your pitch</i>

01:02.558 --> 01:03.691
<i>and hope for the best.</i>

01:03.759 --> 01:04.825
I think
I'm gonna need a drink.

01:10.931 --> 01:12.999
Let me clarify. We're not
robbing the whole bank.

01:13.066 --> 01:15.634
We're just going after
<i>one</i> safety-deposit box.

01:15.702 --> 01:18.304
I <i>think</i> that's still
considered bank robbery?

01:19.672 --> 01:22.373
Either you tell me what this is about
or we're done here.

01:22.441 --> 01:24.842
All right. But this <i>cannot</i>
<i>leave this room, mom.</i>

01:24.910 --> 01:27.311
Michael has been helping me
with the investigation

01:27.378 --> 01:29.846
that I was working
before I got fired.

01:29.914 --> 01:31.648
There's someone out there

01:31.716 --> 01:33.450
starting some pretty nasty
little wars.

01:33.517 --> 01:34.985
They're assassinating leaders.

01:35.052 --> 01:37.020
They'll raze an entire village
just to make a buck.

01:37.088 --> 01:39.455
And you're going to stop them
by robbing a bank?

01:39.523 --> 01:41.723
Last month, they tried to steal
this safety-deposit box.

01:41.791 --> 01:42.958
The heist was a bust.

01:43.026 --> 01:44.559
Soon as they put
a new team together,

01:44.627 --> 01:46.161
they're going to try
to hit it again.

01:46.228 --> 01:47.896
Now, if we can get our hands
on that box,

01:47.964 --> 01:50.165
it could shed some light on who
these people are and what they want.

01:50.232 --> 01:52.033
And you want me
to steal the box?

01:52.101 --> 01:53.067
No, no, no.

01:53.135 --> 01:54.402
All we need is your help

01:54.470 --> 01:56.471
to see how the security team
reacts to the alarm.

01:56.539 --> 01:58.039
I can get into
the security offices

01:58.107 --> 01:59.474
to check out their response,

01:59.541 --> 02:01.575
but we need someone in the vault
to trigger the alarm.

02:01.643 --> 02:05.712
And all you have to do, mom,
is the one thing

02:05.780 --> 02:07.781
I have never been able
to get you to stop doing.

02:11.386 --> 02:12.586
What do you say,
Mrs. Westen?

02:12.654 --> 02:14.154
Feel like playing
a little Bonnie and Clyde?

02:14.222 --> 02:15.922
Bonnie and Clyde
got shot.

02:15.990 --> 02:18.291
Look, the worst that's gonna
happen is you'll get a fine.

02:18.359 --> 02:19.658
Come on, Maddy.

02:19.726 --> 02:20.826
Maddy?

02:24.664 --> 02:26.064
That's my partner in crime.

02:34.036 --> 02:35.403
Thank you.

02:35.470 --> 02:37.838
<i>In banks</i>
<i>and other secure facilities,</i>

02:37.906 --> 02:41.041
<i>the biggest threats</i>
<i>are the ones you invite in.</i>

02:41.108 --> 02:44.077
<i>Getting a job</i>
<i>dropping off sandwiches</i>

02:44.144 --> 02:45.745
<i>requires</i>
<i>fewer background checks</i>

02:45.813 --> 02:47.880
<i>than getting a job</i>
<i>guarding millions of dollars,</i>

02:47.948 --> 02:50.216
<i>but it gives you</i>
<i>the same access.</i>

02:50.283 --> 02:51.684
Hey. Over here.

02:51.752 --> 02:53.086
<i>Plus a tip.</i>

02:53.153 --> 02:54.787
Oh, why, thank you.
Thank you, man.

02:54.855 --> 02:55.522
You're welcome.

02:58.725 --> 02:59.358
Okay.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.661
Got an egg salad.

03:02.728 --> 03:07.699
<i>Most commercial facilities link</i>
<i>smoke and security systems.</i>

03:07.766 --> 03:10.535
<i>Trigger one alarm,</i>
<i>and you trigger them all.</i>

03:10.602 --> 03:13.902
<i>Smoke alarms work by detecting</i>
<i>irregularly dispersed light.</i>

03:13.969 --> 03:15.803
<i>Setting one off</i>
<i>with a cigarette</i>

03:15.871 --> 03:18.806
<i>requires a little time</i>
<i>and a lot of lung capacity.</i>

03:20.442 --> 03:23.143
It's the vault!
Go check it out!

03:25.312 --> 03:27.113
Wow.
Y'all don't mess around.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.381
That's a whole lot of fuss
over a little nicotine fit, huh?

03:29.449 --> 03:31.383
Lighting up in there
is against state law.

03:31.451 --> 03:33.118
Grandma's getting arrested.

03:33.185 --> 03:34.185
She'll do jail time.

03:36.888 --> 03:37.855
Get what we needed?

03:37.922 --> 03:40.390
Yeah, but, uh...

03:40.458 --> 03:42.525
They're coming down
a little harder on your mom

03:42.593 --> 03:44.093
than we thought.

03:47.297 --> 03:49.598
That doesn't look like
a small fine!

03:49.665 --> 03:51.232
Yeah, I know.
They're taking her downtown.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.000
Look, we better just hope
she doesn't say anything, man.

03:53.068 --> 03:55.303
"Say anything"?! She opened up
a bank account, Jesse!

03:55.370 --> 03:56.804
They have her address!

03:56.872 --> 03:59.072
They have her name,
her social security number!

03:59.140 --> 04:00.941
They can't
take her downtown!

04:01.008 --> 04:02.775
I know, Mike! That's what I'm saying!
Hold on! That's what I'm saying, man!

04:02.843 --> 04:04.144
She's getting arrested?! We got to spring
her before the cops get involved.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.411
That's what we got to do.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.846
You don't --

04:10.083 --> 04:11.717
some getaway drivers
<i>you</i> are.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.553
Mom, how'd you --

04:15.620 --> 04:17.120
that nice man
was <i>so</i> sympathetic.

04:17.189 --> 04:19.891
I told him that I was smoking
to calm my nerves.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.259
That I was very upset

04:21.326 --> 04:24.161
putting those pictures
of my husband in there,

04:24.228 --> 04:25.828
And I just couldn't help myself.

04:27.230 --> 04:29.431
First thing Frank's been
good for in 30 years.

04:30.566 --> 04:31.565
Get in the car.

04:32.053 --> 04:36.953

04:40.658 --> 04:42.493
I'm telling you --
this bank we're hitting

04:42.560 --> 04:44.494
has got more guards
than Buckingham Palace.

04:44.562 --> 04:46.529
There's two here,
three back here,

04:46.596 --> 04:47.829
and two more over here.

04:47.897 --> 04:49.464
I mean,
even if we get around them,

04:49.532 --> 04:51.432
we're not gonna have enough time
to drill into the vault.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.433
Okay. Yeah.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.301
Did you hear what I just said?
That was bad news.

04:55.369 --> 04:56.869
Cooper, Ross and Associates.

04:56.937 --> 04:58.704
It's a law firm
on the second floor.

04:58.772 --> 05:01.239
Their security --
not quite as good.

05:01.307 --> 05:03.207
All we need to get in --

05:03.274 --> 05:04.274
key card.

05:04.342 --> 05:06.443
Okay, so,
we swipe a key card.

05:06.511 --> 05:08.145
Then...You want to blast our way
into the vault

05:08.212 --> 05:10.114
through
their conference-room floor.

05:10.181 --> 05:11.982
They're lawyers.
They have it coming.

05:15.453 --> 05:19.689
Wow.
Someone's looking nice.

05:19.757 --> 05:21.925
Hey, what can I say?
I clean up good.

05:21.992 --> 05:23.125
We're working security

05:23.193 --> 05:24.927
for some business bigwig's
dinner party.

05:24.994 --> 05:26.395
Told us to dress up
and blend in.

05:28.297 --> 05:29.464
Ow!

05:29.531 --> 05:31.266
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.933
You're working with Sam, huh?
Yeah.

05:33.001 --> 05:34.535
I thought I'd partner up

05:34.603 --> 05:37.137
with someone
who values my opinion.

05:37.205 --> 05:38.638
I'm just here for my Walther.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.406
I've got
a trunk full of guns,

05:40.474 --> 05:42.308
and nothing fits
in my clutch.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.542
What did you do?

05:43.610 --> 05:46.278
Hurry up, will ya?
He said not to be late.

05:46.345 --> 05:47.612
This coming from a man

05:47.680 --> 05:49.447
who spent half an hour
shellacking his hair.

05:49.514 --> 05:50.681
You should be grateful.

05:50.749 --> 05:52.449
Most married men
let themselves fall apart.

05:52.517 --> 05:53.850
Charles Finley had a shotgun wedding

05:53.918 --> 05:55.552
for the sake of his cover.

05:55.619 --> 05:57.520
That's Charlotte,
the old ball and chain.

05:57.588 --> 05:59.989
Call me that again, and we'll
have a shotgun divorce.

06:00.056 --> 06:02.558
Let's get this party started.

06:06.028 --> 06:07.662
Don't ask.

06:12.366 --> 06:13.800
I hate these parties.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.468
No matter
how many I throw,

06:15.535 --> 06:17.803
I never get used to
wearing a monkey suit,

06:17.870 --> 06:19.838
dancing for investors.

06:19.906 --> 06:21.339
Damn it.

06:21.407 --> 06:23.140
Darling,
let me help you with that.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.176
This is Sarah --
my better half.

06:26.244 --> 06:28.244
Pleased to meet you.

06:28.312 --> 06:29.378
Fiona, right?

06:29.446 --> 06:30.679
"Charlotte"
for tonight.

06:30.747 --> 06:31.780
"Charles"...

06:32.948 --> 06:34.848
...For whenever
it's needed.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.384
I'm so grateful you could come
on such short notice.

06:37.451 --> 06:39.955
So, what's got your cummerbund
in a bunch, Mr. Aitkens?

06:40.022 --> 06:41.856
Well, someone is
out to nab Liby.

06:43.659 --> 06:48.094
It's my company's
new lithium ion battery.

06:48.162 --> 06:49.895
She's lighter
and longer-lasting

06:49.963 --> 06:53.399
than any
of my competitor's products.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.768
They'd pass a paperweight
to get their mitts on her.

06:55.836 --> 06:58.004
So you think someone's
trying to steal her --

06:58.071 --> 06:59.138
or <i>it.</i>

06:59.206 --> 07:01.741
Somebody broke into my car
yesterday.

07:01.808 --> 07:04.076
Luckily,
all they got was a laptop

07:04.144 --> 07:07.713
with a few personal e-mails
and some Garth Brooks mp3s.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.147
Could've been worse.
Could've been Creedence.

07:11.150 --> 07:12.717
Any idea who we're looking for?

07:12.784 --> 07:15.085
I believe we are looking
for a man or a woman

07:15.153 --> 07:17.053
who would like
to become filthy rich.

07:17.121 --> 07:19.856
Now, I'll tell you this --
if they're smart,

07:19.923 --> 07:21.990
they'll pose
as an investor here tonight.

07:22.058 --> 07:23.925
If you're so concerned
with the guest list,

07:23.993 --> 07:25.193
why not
call off the soiree?

07:25.260 --> 07:26.560
Tonight's Liby's debut.

07:26.628 --> 07:28.695
I have to show her off
to whet market appetite.

07:28.763 --> 07:31.230
But I can't have either of you
spooking my investors.

07:31.298 --> 07:34.933
Now, I want you to blend in,
keep your eyes peeled.

07:35.001 --> 07:37.569
If you catch the thief,
you know...

07:37.637 --> 07:38.803
Shoot 'em.

07:38.871 --> 07:40.338
Uh, don't give her
any ideas.

07:40.405 --> 07:42.573
I think we should
get the lay of the land

07:42.640 --> 07:44.274
before the festivities start.

07:44.342 --> 07:46.676
Well, if there are
any break-in attempts up here,

07:46.744 --> 07:48.077
we'll know it.

07:48.145 --> 07:49.945
Christian's got more security
than the batcave.

07:50.013 --> 07:51.647
See anything
out of the ordinary?

07:51.715 --> 07:53.949
Other than a computer
that requires a retina scan

07:54.016 --> 07:55.383
or a toilet
that plays bird songs

07:55.451 --> 07:57.718
while it blow-dries
your unmentionables?

07:57.785 --> 07:59.753
<i>When you're working</i>
<i>a protection detail,</i>

07:59.820 --> 08:01.621
<i>it's all about observation.</i>

08:01.689 --> 08:03.289
<i>You're looking</i>
<i>for broken locks,</i>

08:03.356 --> 08:05.323
<i>blocked motion sensors --</i>

08:05.391 --> 08:08.526
<i>the subtle signs that someone's</i>
<i>trying to breach security.</i>

08:08.594 --> 08:10.528
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>some security breaches</i>

08:10.596 --> 08:11.796
<i>are a lot more subtle</i>
<i>than others.</i>

08:13.398 --> 08:14.465
It's the caterers.
I'll get it.

08:17.301 --> 08:18.068
Sarah!

08:26.944 --> 08:28.477
Get in there. Get down.
What? Wha--

08:28.545 --> 08:29.545
get in the tub.

08:30.447 --> 08:32.081
Hey, what the hell
is going on down there?

08:32.149 --> 08:33.883
We got party crashers
with automatics.

08:33.951 --> 08:35.318
Hey, I got to get down there!
No!

08:35.385 --> 08:36.217
We have to --
Christian, you stay put!

08:36.285 --> 08:37.553
But --
do not come out!

08:39.000 --> 08:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:46.395 --> 08:49.731
They got an Uzi on full auto
pinning me down.

08:49.799 --> 08:50.665
Fi...They're not
coming up <i>here.</i>

08:52.334 --> 08:53.834
They're coming for <i>you.</i>

08:59.641 --> 09:01.074
This sounds like
a kidnapping, Sam.

09:01.142 --> 09:02.809
And I got no way out.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.612
I' m gonna have to wave
the white flag.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.413
Fi, no.
It's too dangerous.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.750
What are you doing?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.918
Don't let them know
who I am.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.220
But your gun --
aren't you gonna --

09:16.288 --> 09:17.722
look.

09:17.789 --> 09:19.956
If I start shooting now,
we're both gonna wind up dead.

09:20.024 --> 09:21.190
We'll roll with the punches.

09:21.258 --> 09:22.889
Trust me --
when the time is right,

09:22.957 --> 09:24.523
we're gonna punch
right back.

09:41.571 --> 09:43.705
Wait! Where are you
taking Sarah?!

09:45.141 --> 09:46.808
D-does Christian
owe you money?

09:46.876 --> 09:48.576
I said shut up,
bitch!

09:48.644 --> 09:50.445
Please --
w-whatever you need,

09:50.512 --> 09:51.946
my husband,
he can take care of it.

09:52.014 --> 09:52.747
What did you say?

09:52.815 --> 09:54.082
My husband --

09:54.149 --> 09:55.816
he has <i>much</i> money.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.828
Shh!

10:08.597 --> 10:09.697
Aah!

10:19.539 --> 10:20.672
Jesus!

10:21.974 --> 10:23.907
Dial Mike.

10:23.975 --> 10:25.275
Yeah, Sam.
How's the party?

10:25.342 --> 10:27.909
There were four guys,
locked and loaded.

10:27.976 --> 10:29.343
I tried to stop them,

10:29.411 --> 10:30.478
but they got the client.

10:30.545 --> 10:31.545
And, Mike...

10:31.613 --> 10:33.146
They got Fiona.

10:37.767 --> 10:38.866
Well, when they stole
my laptop,

10:38.934 --> 10:40.334
they got everything
they needed --

10:40.402 --> 10:44.071
pictures of Sarah,
details about the party,

10:44.138 --> 10:45.638
our address.

10:45.706 --> 10:47.940
All this time, I thought
it was about business.

10:48.008 --> 10:50.109
So stupid!

10:50.177 --> 10:53.612
Well, it was about business --
just a different kind.

10:53.679 --> 10:55.713
You said these guys
had accents, right?

10:55.781 --> 10:58.215
Got the bullets to match --
9-millimeter black-tipped imis.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.749
All the rage in Mexico City.

10:59.817 --> 11:01.951
Mexico City?
What the hell is he talk--

11:02.019 --> 11:04.420
below the border, express
kidnappings are big business.

11:04.488 --> 11:06.121
Looks like
somebody expanded stateside.

11:08.157 --> 11:10.525
I checked the hospitals.
Nothing.

11:10.593 --> 11:12.393
Still no chatter
on the police band.

11:12.461 --> 11:14.428
My buddy pulled traffic cams,
but he got zilch.

11:14.496 --> 11:15.763
These guys are ghosts,
Mike.

11:22.136 --> 11:24.070
Yeah, we got a webcam call
from your wife's account.

11:24.138 --> 11:26.972
Looks like
they're ready to talk.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.440
Gentlemen...

11:28.508 --> 11:31.075
I believe I have something
you are looking for.

11:31.143 --> 11:33.344
Sarah?
Oh, my God!

11:33.411 --> 11:34.645
Let <i>him</i>
<i>do the talking.</i>

11:34.713 --> 11:35.779
Well, well.

11:35.847 --> 11:38.349
I see a new face.
Who invited <i>you?</i>

11:38.416 --> 11:39.750
You can call me Vikner.

11:39.817 --> 11:41.552
I'll be negotiating
the release

11:41.619 --> 11:43.386
of Mrs. Aitkens
and Mrs. Finley.

11:43.454 --> 11:46.890
You know the drill.
I need to hear from the women.

11:46.958 --> 11:49.759
<i>It's a good sign</i>
<i>if kidnappers wear masks</i>

11:49.827 --> 11:50.860
<i>and shy away from cameras.</i>

11:50.928 --> 11:52.929
<i>By protecting their anonymity,</i>

11:52.996 --> 11:54.563
<i>they protect their hostages.</i>

11:54.631 --> 11:57.032
<i>If a kidnapper</i>
<i>lets you see his face,</i>

11:57.100 --> 11:59.068
<i>he's probably not planning</i>
<i>on letting you live</i>

11:59.135 --> 12:00.636
<i>to testify against him.</i>

12:00.703 --> 12:02.371
Christian...

12:02.439 --> 12:06.374
Baby, they want $10 million
for each of us.

12:06.442 --> 12:09.510
Please, just pay them the money,
and they'll let us live.

12:09.578 --> 12:10.477
I love you -- aah!

12:10.545 --> 12:11.679
Thank you, Sarah.

12:11.746 --> 12:13.581
That was wonderful.

12:13.648 --> 12:15.149
The best products
always sell themselves.

12:15.216 --> 12:17.284
$20 million
is quite a price tag.

12:17.351 --> 12:18.818
We'll need some time
to get it together.

12:18.886 --> 12:21.187
Do you think
I didn't do my homework?

12:21.255 --> 12:23.587
Mr. Aitkens is worth
twice that -- liquid.

12:23.655 --> 12:27.417
A man in your line of work needs
unmarked, nonconsecutive bills.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.584
Can't exactly scoop that from under
the couch cushions, can we?

12:29.652 --> 12:30.752
You have 24 hours.

12:30.820 --> 12:32.053
Not a second more.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.320
Are we understood?

12:33.388 --> 12:34.488
We'll get you the cash,

12:34.556 --> 12:37.557
but we won't pay
for damaged goods.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.092
Do not...Hurt them.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.493
You just don't be late.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.595
Tardiness makes
my trigger finger...

12:43.663 --> 12:45.263
Itchy.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.764
I can probably get a trace
on their I.P.

12:46.831 --> 12:49.066
Forget that! I'll pay!
I can get the money!

12:49.133 --> 12:50.500
Money won't save them.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.743
They want $10 million
for each of us.

12:59.811 --> 13:01.578
You know, Fi's not the type
to get all teary-eyed

13:01.646 --> 13:03.313
over a gun to her head.

13:03.381 --> 13:04.581
She's sending us
a message.

13:04.649 --> 13:05.882
Please,
just pay them the money,

13:05.950 --> 13:07.350
and they'll let us live.

13:07.418 --> 13:09.719
One long blink, one short,
then three more long.

13:09.787 --> 13:11.354
She's blinking "no"
in morse code.

13:13.224 --> 13:14.624
If we pay the ransom,
the girls are dead.

13:16.594 --> 13:18.728
The floor!
Come on!

13:26.671 --> 13:28.705
I apologize
for my kid brother.

13:28.772 --> 13:31.241
Eddy's a good guy.
He's just a bit of a hothead.

13:41.618 --> 13:43.686
Please...

13:43.754 --> 13:44.754
Just don't hurt us.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.458
I wouldn't dream of it.

13:48.525 --> 13:51.427
As soon as we get our payday,
I let you go.

13:51.495 --> 13:52.695
Honest.

13:54.932 --> 13:58.467
Now, ladies, sit tight.

13:58.535 --> 14:00.136
Don't cause any trouble.

14:00.203 --> 14:01.370
Everything will go smoothly.

14:01.438 --> 14:04.840
Make sure our guests
are cared for. Hmm?

14:04.907 --> 14:06.141
Whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.242
You're not gonna leave us here
with <i>him?</i>

14:08.310 --> 14:11.011
What's the matter?
You don't like your chaperon?

14:11.079 --> 14:13.447
H-he's been eyeing us
n-nonstop.

14:13.515 --> 14:15.015
Is this true?

14:15.083 --> 14:17.117
No. No.
He wasn't.

14:19.987 --> 14:21.186
I don't want
to cause trouble.

14:21.254 --> 14:22.521
Jesus, Sarah.

14:22.589 --> 14:24.091
I saw the way
you were looking back at him.

14:24.158 --> 14:25.726
You think you can flirt your way
out of this?

14:25.794 --> 14:28.095
He's not
your goddamn tennis coach!

14:28.163 --> 14:30.865
<i>Kidnappers see hostages</i>
<i>as commodities.</i>

14:30.933 --> 14:32.033
<i>Like a good stockbroker,</i>

14:32.101 --> 14:33.501
<i>they'll protect</i>
<i>their investment</i>

14:33.569 --> 14:34.535
<i>until it's time to cash in.</i>

14:36.272 --> 14:38.940
<i>If they see a risk,</i>
<i>they'll hedge against it.</i>

14:41.410 --> 14:43.011
Now, be good girls.

14:43.078 --> 14:45.013
No more fuss.
Okay?

14:46.715 --> 14:50.718
High-maintenance women are
more trouble than they're worth.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.391
I'm sorry.
I needed to buy some privacy.

14:56.458 --> 14:57.392
Can I borrow that?

14:57.460 --> 14:58.360
My earring?

14:58.427 --> 15:00.495
Your jewel-encrusted
lock pick.

15:01.697 --> 15:04.165
They're right outside the door.
They're not gonna --

15:04.233 --> 15:06.234
relax. This should
only take a second.

15:16.610 --> 15:17.610
What are you doing?

15:17.678 --> 15:18.911
We're gonna get
out of here.

15:25.718 --> 15:28.419
But what about the FBI?
Now, they could...

15:28.487 --> 15:31.622
Get your wife killed
very quickly.

15:31.690 --> 15:33.757
We're up against pros here,
Christian.

15:33.825 --> 15:36.359
They get one whiff of
police involvement, it's over.

15:36.426 --> 15:37.459
We need some guns.

15:37.527 --> 15:39.161
Take Fi's car.
Her trunk is an armory.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.762
I should come with you.
More boots on the ground...

15:40.830 --> 15:42.697
The noisier
we'll be stomping.

15:45.167 --> 15:47.134
200 of Christian's
closest friends

15:47.202 --> 15:50.137
are gonna be calling about
why his party was canceled.

15:50.205 --> 15:51.571
You need to keep them
from getting too curious.

15:51.639 --> 15:52.706
I'm on damage control?

15:52.773 --> 15:54.107
We're controlling a lot more

15:54.174 --> 15:55.841
than damage
to his reputation, Jesse.

15:55.909 --> 15:57.742
If the press get ahold of this,
Fiona's dead.

15:59.277 --> 16:00.177
I'm counting on you.

16:01.345 --> 16:02.011
Ready to ride?

16:06.616 --> 16:07.549
Where are you going?

16:07.617 --> 16:08.750
You promised you'd tell me

16:08.818 --> 16:10.518
all about our bank heist
over breakfast.

16:10.586 --> 16:12.786
What's the matter?
You don't like doughnuts?

16:12.854 --> 16:14.120
Mom,
Fi's been kidnapped.

16:14.188 --> 16:16.088
Kidnapped?
What the hell are you talk--

16:16.156 --> 16:18.357
we were doing a security job,
and the client's wife was taken.

16:18.425 --> 16:19.525
Fi went with her.

16:19.593 --> 16:21.193
The client's upstairs
with Jesse.

16:21.260 --> 16:22.463
They're working
on keeping this quiet

16:22.530 --> 16:23.466
while we track down
the girls.

16:23.534 --> 16:24.568
Well,
I'll wait with them.

16:24.636 --> 16:25.939
There must be something
I can do.

16:26.006 --> 16:27.675
Mom, we got this covered.
You should go home now.

16:27.743 --> 16:29.243
I'll go home
when Fiona does.

16:30.745 --> 16:32.079
You go find your girlfriend.

16:34.615 --> 16:37.150
<i>Creating an explosive device</i>
<i>in the field</i>

16:37.218 --> 16:39.519
<i>requires a strong knowledge</i>
<i>of chemistry</i>

16:39.587 --> 16:41.054
<i>and the ability to improvise</i>

16:41.122 --> 16:43.056
<i>with whatever equipment</i>
<i>happens to be lying around.</i>

16:45.026 --> 16:46.726
Can you hold that?

16:46.794 --> 16:49.828
<i>An old fire extinguisher makes</i>
<i>an ideal compression chamber.</i>

16:49.896 --> 16:52.463
<i>Add some metal shavings and</i>
<i>the right cleaning supplies,</i>

16:52.531 --> 16:53.931
<i>and you can serve up a bomb</i>

16:53.999 --> 16:57.067
<i>that will blast through</i>
<i>a cinder-block wall.</i>

17:01.072 --> 17:02.405
Why is it
you can never find

17:02.473 --> 17:04.807
a good sodium hydroxide
solution when you need one?

17:05.976 --> 17:07.143
I need to get
to the bathroom.

17:07.210 --> 17:08.777
They said
if we don't make trouble --

17:08.845 --> 17:12.180
Sarah, we're already in trouble.
We saw their faces.

17:12.248 --> 17:15.583
The moment they get their money,
they're gonna kill us.

17:15.651 --> 17:17.852
Christian won't let that happen.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.287
He'll save me.
He'll --

17:19.355 --> 17:20.622
sometimes you have to be
your <i>own</i> white knight.

17:20.690 --> 17:23.491
Trust me.

17:23.559 --> 17:25.393
What do you
want me to do?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.361
Give me that.

17:28.764 --> 17:30.898
I need you
to work with me.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.333
And we will
get out of this alive.

17:36.505 --> 17:37.772
What are you doing?!

17:39.041 --> 17:40.441
Getting a hall pass
to the bathroom.

17:40.509 --> 17:43.411
The guard has cellphones.
I need to get to his bag.

17:43.478 --> 17:45.279
Could you, uh --
ooh -- give me a hand?

17:46.148 --> 17:46.981
Aah!

17:47.049 --> 17:48.349
Wha--
just go with it!

17:48.417 --> 17:49.917
Get this lunatic off me!

17:51.787 --> 17:53.488
Don't you pull my hair,
you bitch!

17:53.555 --> 17:55.957
Ladies! What's going on here?!
<i>You're</i> the bitch!

17:56.025 --> 17:57.625
Charles will pay
a hundred times for me

17:57.693 --> 17:59.794
what Christian would pay
for you -- just you wait.

17:59.862 --> 18:02.397
What did I say?
Look at you.

18:02.465 --> 18:04.165
Madre de dios.
Look at that cut.

18:04.233 --> 18:06.066
The negotiators
will not pay for this.

18:06.134 --> 18:07.334
Get her cleaned up.

18:07.402 --> 18:08.968
Get your filthy hands
off me, you fat --

18:09.036 --> 18:10.136
aah!

18:10.203 --> 18:11.237
Ow!

18:14.140 --> 18:15.673
You're a thug!

18:15.741 --> 18:17.175
Almost took my arm off!

18:18.744 --> 18:20.611
You can't buy grace,
can you?

18:20.679 --> 18:21.945
Unlike
that nose of yours.

18:22.013 --> 18:22.913
Kill you!

18:22.980 --> 18:23.413
Ohh!

18:23.481 --> 18:24.180
No!

18:24.248 --> 18:25.415
I'm going to kill <i>you!</i>

18:25.482 --> 18:27.816
If you don't stop fighting
and behave yourself!

18:29.719 --> 18:31.619
You're a bloody mess.

18:31.687 --> 18:32.519
Go.

18:47.968 --> 18:50.766
So, Jesse said the kidnapper's
I.P. came from this address.

18:50.834 --> 18:54.599
Either they really like lattes
or they're boosting the signal.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.366
Fi could be
anywhere within a mile.

18:56.434 --> 18:57.932
That's a lot of summer homes
to check out.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.667
Hello?

18:59.735 --> 19:00.935
Michael, it's me.

19:01.003 --> 19:02.503
Fi!
Hey! She got a phone!

19:02.571 --> 19:03.871
<i>That's</i> the woman
I married.

19:03.938 --> 19:05.071
Get my message?

19:05.139 --> 19:06.806
Yeah, loud and blinky.
But don't worry --

19:06.874 --> 19:09.108
we kept Christian
from backing up the money truck.

19:09.176 --> 19:10.976
Well, there are
two brothers in charge.

19:11.044 --> 19:12.745
They're playing nice
right now.

19:12.812 --> 19:14.546
The second
they get their money,

19:14.614 --> 19:16.081
the gloves are coming off.

19:16.149 --> 19:17.882
Any idea where you are?

19:17.950 --> 19:20.385
No. But it's about to have
one less wall.

19:20.452 --> 19:21.919
We still have 20 hours.

19:21.987 --> 19:24.054
It's <i>one</i> of you
against <i>four</i> of them.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.422
Don't feel bad for them,
Michael.

19:26.591 --> 19:28.125
Wait. What about Charlotte?

19:28.193 --> 19:30.728
Isn't she coming with us?
Hang on.

19:30.796 --> 19:32.963
I'm afraid Charlotte
is not as fortunate as you.

19:33.031 --> 19:34.732
Your husband
was the only one who paid.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.534
No!

19:49.881 --> 19:51.349
Michael, Christian made a deal
for Sarah.

19:51.416 --> 19:53.718
No, no, no.
Jesse's with him. He couldn't --

19:53.785 --> 19:55.486
I don't know how it happened,
but it happened.

19:55.553 --> 19:58.689
You know that --
that 20 hours we had?

19:58.757 --> 20:00.091
It's more like <i>one.</i>

20:04.961 --> 20:06.026
Come on.

20:09.326 --> 20:09.958
Fi?

20:10.026 --> 20:11.090
Fi!

20:11.225 --> 20:12.557
Fi!

20:16.650 --> 20:19.889
Well, I don't see anything
but summer homes and drop-tops.

20:19.956 --> 20:22.362
Not a white panel van
or a creepy safe house in sight.

20:22.429 --> 20:23.529
Call Jesse.

20:26.766 --> 20:28.367
Damn it!
Pick up!

20:28.434 --> 20:30.669
You've got him spinning
public relations, keeping this quiet.

20:30.736 --> 20:31.937
Maybe he's tying up
the lines.

20:32.004 --> 20:33.404
He should have been
tying up Christian,

20:33.472 --> 20:35.506
not buying Fi and Sarah
a death sentence.

20:35.574 --> 20:36.741
Okay, Mike,
just don't kill Jesse.

20:36.808 --> 20:37.942
We need him right now.

20:38.009 --> 20:39.710
Fi's got to be
around here somewhere.

20:43.914 --> 20:45.114
Mike, how's it going?

20:45.182 --> 20:47.150
Finally! What the hell
are you doing?!

20:47.217 --> 20:48.284
What are you talking about?

20:48.352 --> 20:50.019
Christian cut a deal
with the kidnappers.

20:50.087 --> 20:52.154
You think maybe you should have
told me about that?

20:52.222 --> 20:53.555
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where's all this coming from?

20:53.623 --> 20:54.723
Fi got a call out.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.057
Sounds like
we got about an hour

20:56.125 --> 20:57.659
before they dangle Sarah
for the cash

20:57.726 --> 20:58.960
and put a bullet in both of them.

20:59.027 --> 21:00.194
No, no, no. No. No, no.

21:00.262 --> 21:01.896
He's been on the phone
the whole time.

21:01.964 --> 21:03.466
He -- he stepped out
on the balc--

21:03.533 --> 21:05.836
he stepped out on the balcony
to get some air. Damn it!

21:05.903 --> 21:07.871
You can beat yourself up
about it later. I'll help.

21:07.939 --> 21:10.340
Right now, you need to find out
where the drop is.

21:10.408 --> 21:12.576
And if Christian
pays these guys, Fi's dead!

21:12.644 --> 21:13.677
Mike, I'm gonna
make this right.

21:19.384 --> 21:20.617
Where's Sarah?

21:20.685 --> 21:23.421
After your little catfight,
I thought it best

21:23.489 --> 21:25.390
to...
Give you some space.

21:25.457 --> 21:27.158
You didn't kill her,
did you?

21:27.226 --> 21:29.327
Where would you get
such a crazy notion like that?

21:29.395 --> 21:32.298
Mrs. Sarah is gonna be worth
very much very soon.

21:32.366 --> 21:33.466
What do you mean?

21:35.269 --> 21:38.171
H-her husband paid...

21:38.239 --> 21:39.573
Didn't he?

21:39.640 --> 21:41.908
Perhaps
you chose the wrong man.

21:41.976 --> 21:44.310
Could you do something
about this heat?

21:44.378 --> 21:46.746
I feel like...I'm gonna die.

21:46.814 --> 21:48.382
Oh, we wouldn't
want <i>that.</i>

21:49.785 --> 21:50.986
I'll take care
of the air-conditioning.

22:04.602 --> 22:06.468
Fi.
Are you all right?

22:07.603 --> 22:08.735
Never been better.

22:08.803 --> 22:09.903
How's Sarah?

22:09.970 --> 22:11.403
I don't know.
They separated us.

22:11.471 --> 22:12.738
I think they're getting ready
to move her.

22:12.805 --> 22:13.805
I'm not gonna let that happen.

22:13.872 --> 22:15.971
My exit strategy's almost ready.

22:16.039 --> 22:17.305
But then I'm working
on a different way

22:17.373 --> 22:18.339
to get into her room.

22:18.407 --> 22:19.841
No, no, no.

22:19.908 --> 22:21.707
I want to be there before
anything starts to blow up.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.602
Oh. How gallant.

22:23.670 --> 22:25.336
Hey, guys,
maybe you can argue later.

22:25.403 --> 22:27.369
Right now, Fi, just give us
a description of the house --

22:27.437 --> 22:29.137
something we can
go off of here.

22:29.205 --> 22:30.737
Well, I can do better
than that.

22:30.805 --> 22:32.638
I'm sending you
a smoke signal.

22:32.705 --> 22:34.339
Don't call <i>me.</i>
<i>I'll call you.</i>

22:36.775 --> 22:38.241
<i>A good smoke signal</i>

22:38.309 --> 22:41.478
<i>requires dense, visible clouds</i>
<i>of smoke or vapor.</i>

22:41.546 --> 22:43.080
<i>You can't just light</i>
<i>whatever's handy on fire</i>

22:43.147 --> 22:44.448
<i>and hope for the best.</i>

22:46.117 --> 22:49.353
<i>Rubber burns with a thick,</i>
<i>black smoke -- that's perfect.</i>

22:49.421 --> 22:51.955
<i>Put a burning pile of it</i>
<i>in an air-conditioning duct,</i>

22:52.023 --> 22:54.525
<i>and the house's ventilation</i>
<i>system will carry it out</i>

22:54.593 --> 22:56.262
<i>where it can be seen</i>
<i>from a distance.</i>

22:57.898 --> 22:59.765
You need to call him back right now
and call it off, Christian.

22:59.833 --> 23:01.266
No, it's like
I'm saying to you --

23:01.334 --> 23:02.601
I <i>can't</i> call it off.

23:02.668 --> 23:04.169
They said
the deal was final!

23:04.236 --> 23:05.503
If I back out now,
they'll kill her!

23:05.570 --> 23:06.503
I can't tell you anything!

23:06.571 --> 23:07.771
Calm down.

23:07.839 --> 23:09.105
I want you to think back.
Okay?

23:09.173 --> 23:10.873
What'd you do the last time
your wife was kidnapped?

23:10.941 --> 23:12.475
I've never been
in this situation.

23:12.542 --> 23:14.209
Yeah. Yeah. I know that.
We <i>have.</i>

23:14.277 --> 23:16.278
You hired professional security consultants.
Do you understand that?

23:16.345 --> 23:18.779
Tell me where the hand-off is happening
so we can do our job!

23:18.847 --> 23:21.849
Oh, you know, you're pretty
clever with words, Mr. Porter.

23:21.916 --> 23:23.416
Now, you can make me feel
like a rube,

23:23.484 --> 23:25.919
but it doesn't change
what I think,

23:25.986 --> 23:28.187
which is that I'm dealing
with businessmen.

23:28.255 --> 23:30.856
Now, which of us has
more experience in that arena?

23:30.924 --> 23:31.991
You're missing
the point here.

23:32.058 --> 23:33.559
Look, look,
I feel bad.

23:33.627 --> 23:34.660
All right?

23:34.728 --> 23:36.228
And if it's any help,

23:36.296 --> 23:40.132
I'll loan you the $10 million
for Miss Glenanne's ransom.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.068
You know what?
Save it.

23:42.135 --> 23:44.970
You can name a hospital
after your wife when she's dead.

23:45.038 --> 23:46.172
Don't you dare talk --

23:46.239 --> 23:47.640
what's it gonna take
for you to get it?!

23:47.707 --> 23:49.942
You saw Fiona's message.
You're gonna get her killed.

23:50.010 --> 23:51.543
She blinked!

23:51.611 --> 23:54.746
I am not risking Sarah's life
on a damn eye spasm!

23:54.814 --> 23:55.814
She was sending us
a message!

23:55.882 --> 23:57.115
No! No!

23:59.018 --> 23:59.718
Jesse?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.253
Jesse!

24:03.022 --> 24:03.855
Jesse...

24:06.359 --> 24:09.094
You're upset about Fi,
and it's showing.

24:09.162 --> 24:10.328
Now, how do you
expect this guy

24:10.396 --> 24:11.663
to give you
a level-headed decision

24:11.731 --> 24:13.431
when you're about to
tear his arms off?

24:15.768 --> 24:18.069
All right. I'm gonna --
I'm gonna go get some air.

24:21.273 --> 24:22.540
I mean,
what did he expect?

24:22.607 --> 24:24.875
I couldn't
just do <i>nothing.</i>

24:24.943 --> 24:27.311
They have
the woman I love.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.780
He doesn't get it.

24:32.684 --> 24:35.486
I think he understands
<i>exactly</i> how you feel.

24:36.788 --> 24:38.922
So, Mike, you can tell me
to shut up if you want,

24:38.990 --> 24:40.424
but what's going on
with you and Fi these days?

24:41.826 --> 24:44.061
I disappointed her.

24:44.128 --> 24:46.696
The way I got Jesse burned.

24:46.764 --> 24:49.166
The way I'm using him.

24:49.233 --> 24:51.034
She thinks
I'm a little too obsessed

24:51.102 --> 24:52.569
with finding out
who freed Simon.

24:54.338 --> 24:55.272
She might be right.

24:55.339 --> 24:56.540
Mike.

24:58.376 --> 25:00.610
Where there's smoke...

25:00.678 --> 25:02.845
There's Fi.

25:17.522 --> 25:18.589
Jacob?!

25:18.656 --> 25:19.890
Water!

25:19.957 --> 25:22.658
Please don't leave me here!

25:24.360 --> 25:26.627
Shut up, all right?!
I'm coming!

25:32.832 --> 25:34.299
There's your water.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.900
Happy?

25:35.968 --> 25:38.502
<i>Alcohol was used as</i>
<i>an energy source and a weapon</i>

25:38.570 --> 25:41.037
<i>long before anyone had any idea</i>
<i>what gunpowder was.</i>

25:41.105 --> 25:42.805
<i>It doesn't contain</i>
<i>enough energy</i>

25:42.873 --> 25:44.673
<i>to qualify</i>
<i>as a top-grade explosive,</i>

25:44.741 --> 25:46.842
<i>but in most situations,</i>
<i>it's a lot easier</i>

25:46.909 --> 25:49.476
<i>to find a bottle of vodka</i>
<i>than a brick of C-4.</i>

25:49.544 --> 25:50.577
Thank you.

25:50.644 --> 25:51.978
Good. Let's go.

25:52.046 --> 25:54.347
Well, you know,
I was hoping for something

25:54.415 --> 25:55.815
just a little bit stronger.

25:55.883 --> 25:57.817
This isn't cocktail hour,
honey.

25:59.286 --> 26:01.187
I'm starting to think
you don't understand

26:01.254 --> 26:03.122
the seriousness
of your situation.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.322
I think I do.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.595
Charles...
Isn't gonna pay.

26:07.662 --> 26:08.496
Is he?

26:10.566 --> 26:12.000
You know something?

26:12.068 --> 26:13.736
You and I
a-aren't that different.

26:13.804 --> 26:15.071
How's that?

26:15.139 --> 26:17.007
Well...

26:17.075 --> 26:19.910
We both know
what we want...

26:19.978 --> 26:21.282
And we take it.

26:21.350 --> 26:23.087
The only difference is,
is...

26:23.155 --> 26:24.857
You use a gun,

26:24.925 --> 26:26.660
and I have...

26:26.727 --> 26:28.128
Other charms.

26:28.196 --> 26:32.401
Playing the role
of Mrs. Charles Finley.

26:32.468 --> 26:34.036
You want to know
a secret?

26:35.772 --> 26:38.774
I never did love him.

26:38.842 --> 26:40.843
So you married him
for his money?

26:40.910 --> 26:42.278
Well...

26:42.345 --> 26:44.446
It wasn't for what was happening
between the sheets.

26:44.514 --> 26:47.016
And now...

26:47.083 --> 26:49.818
When I need his money
the most, it's...

26:51.387 --> 26:52.654
...It's not there.

26:52.721 --> 26:56.590
Once Sarah's husband
pays for <i>her,</i>

26:56.658 --> 26:57.925
you're not gonna let <i>me</i> go,
are you?

27:00.629 --> 27:01.629
Now...

27:01.697 --> 27:03.598
How about...

27:05.467 --> 27:07.267
...You give a girl
one last drink,

27:07.335 --> 27:09.536
let her say goodbye
to her best friend?

27:09.603 --> 27:11.204
I'll give you your drink.

27:11.272 --> 27:14.140
But your friend Sarah...

27:14.208 --> 27:17.243
Is already on her way...
Home.

27:22.716 --> 27:24.116
Well, then...

27:26.119 --> 27:27.152
...Here's to homecoming.

27:31.891 --> 27:33.092
Ahh.

27:33.159 --> 27:34.560
Won't you let me
keep the bottle?

27:38.264 --> 27:39.798
God.

27:39.865 --> 27:41.967
You decorated for me.

27:43.737 --> 27:45.302
Sorry, but...

27:45.370 --> 27:46.703
...It's easier this way.

27:46.771 --> 27:48.371
How much longer
do I have?

27:48.438 --> 27:49.638
Who knows?

27:49.706 --> 27:52.874
Maybe Eddy gets caught up
in airport traffic...

27:52.942 --> 27:55.310
Or maybe your husband calls
after all.

27:56.545 --> 27:58.779
But if he doesn't...

27:58.847 --> 28:00.114
It won't be too long.

28:01.583 --> 28:04.151
Well, at least
you're finally being honest.

28:04.219 --> 28:07.020
One more favor.

28:08.790 --> 28:10.023
Some gum?

28:10.091 --> 28:12.492
That cheap vodka
tastes like lighter fluid.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.200
I think I would have liked
to know you...

28:23.271 --> 28:24.571
...In a different life.

28:24.639 --> 28:26.006
You mean the next one?

28:26.073 --> 28:28.675
We're both going to hell.

28:39.253 --> 28:42.322
<i>Handcuffs can be</i>
<i>a hostage's best friend.</i>

28:42.390 --> 28:44.424
<i>The same steel</i>
<i>that locks you up</i>

28:44.492 --> 28:45.492
<i>can set you free.</i>

28:46.794 --> 28:48.495
<i>Use the cuffs for leverage</i>

28:48.563 --> 28:50.430
<i>and apply enough pressure,</i>

28:50.498 --> 28:51.898
<i>and you can break</i>
<i>the weakest piece</i>

28:51.966 --> 28:53.000
<i>of whatever you're chained to.</i>

28:55.670 --> 28:57.771
Aah!

28:57.838 --> 29:00.574
<i>But it might not be</i>
<i>the only thing you break.</i>

29:13.823 --> 29:15.123
Perfect timing, Fi.

29:15.191 --> 29:16.525
The cavalry has arrived,
darlin'.

29:16.592 --> 29:18.193
Tell us where you are.
We're coming into the house.

29:19.262 --> 29:20.495
No.

29:20.563 --> 29:22.697
They're headed to the airport.
They took Sarah.

29:22.765 --> 29:25.300
It sounded like they were
going to Miami international.

29:25.367 --> 29:27.235
That's not enough to go on.
I'm not leaving you --

29:27.303 --> 29:30.172
no. Y-you can't come in here
guns blazing.

29:30.240 --> 29:33.175
One call from Jacob,
and his idiot brother

29:33.243 --> 29:35.711
will kill Sarah
before they even make the drop.

29:35.779 --> 29:38.181
So you're gonna stay in there and play
chicken with this guy?

29:38.249 --> 29:41.384
But Jacob and his fat friend
don't know we're playing.

29:41.452 --> 29:42.852
I'll figure out where
the hand-off's gonna happen,

29:42.920 --> 29:44.053
and I'll let you know.

29:44.121 --> 29:45.988
Fine.
I'm going after Sarah.

29:46.056 --> 29:48.325
But I'm leaving Sam here
as backup.

29:48.392 --> 29:49.726
You be careful in there,
missy.

29:49.794 --> 29:51.562
Chuck Finley is too young
to be a widower.

29:51.629 --> 29:53.030
Yeah, well,
don't worry about <i>me.</i>

29:53.097 --> 29:55.799
I am not
your average trophy wife.

30:02.230 --> 30:03.630
If you don't tell us
where the hand-off is --

30:03.698 --> 30:05.802
I've talked all the sense I can
to you people.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.770
I even offered to pay
Miss Glenanne's ransom.

30:07.838 --> 30:09.205
If you'd have listened
to me,

30:09.272 --> 30:11.206
your friend would be on her way
to safety by now.

30:11.274 --> 30:13.208
No, no, listen, the only reason Fiona's
not home safe right now

30:13.275 --> 30:15.108
is because she <i>chose</i> to go
with the kidnappers --

30:15.175 --> 30:16.809
to get us some leverage
to save your wife.

30:16.876 --> 30:18.676
And that doesn't sound
insane to you?

30:18.744 --> 30:20.811
Ain't no leverage
as good as $10 million.

30:20.879 --> 30:22.279
I'm paying!
That's final!

30:22.347 --> 30:25.282
The second they get the money,
your wife is dead.

30:26.651 --> 30:27.885
You're not going anywhere

30:27.953 --> 30:29.621
until you tell me
where they're taking Sarah.

30:29.689 --> 30:30.956
Get out of my way.

30:31.024 --> 30:32.791
Michael still can make it
in time to save your wife.

30:32.859 --> 30:34.626
They'll kill her
if I don't pay!

30:34.694 --> 30:37.695
I can't --
I have to --

30:37.763 --> 30:39.897
I can't just sit here
and do nothing!

30:41.332 --> 30:42.399
I get it.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.167
I get it.
You're covering your ass.

30:44.235 --> 30:46.169
This is just another business
decision for you. Right?

30:46.236 --> 30:48.004
You don't know what's gonna
happen. None of us do.

30:48.072 --> 30:49.473
But this way,
you pay the ransom,

30:49.540 --> 30:50.874
you got your story
for the funeral.

30:50.942 --> 30:52.543
"Did everything I could."

30:52.610 --> 30:54.044
Even though
it's a damn lie.

30:54.112 --> 30:55.979
You son of a bitch!

30:56.047 --> 30:57.680
That's my wife
you're talking about!

30:57.748 --> 30:59.281
That's right.
That's right.

30:59.349 --> 31:00.449
That's your wife
you're giving up on.

31:10.061 --> 31:11.396
Okay.

31:13.866 --> 31:16.768
The lighthouse at Cape Florida.

31:16.835 --> 31:19.470
My C.F.O.'S meeting him there
with the money.

31:19.538 --> 31:21.071
Call him off.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.407
You could
save <i>his</i> life, too.

31:26.711 --> 31:28.245
Good old guilt trip --
works every time.

31:28.312 --> 31:30.147
You're telling <i>me?</i>
<i>I'm a mother.</i>

31:36.487 --> 31:37.788
Jesse, tell me
you got something.

31:37.855 --> 31:40.056
The drop is happening
at the Cape Florida lighthouse.

31:40.124 --> 31:41.924
Drive fast.
It's going down in five.

31:41.992 --> 31:45.161
<i>Only 10%</i>
<i>of a 60-watt bulb's energy</i>

31:45.229 --> 31:46.562
<i>is dispersed as light.</i>

31:46.630 --> 31:48.097
<i>The rest is heat.</i>

31:48.165 --> 31:49.532
<i>Fill one</i>
<i>with a flammable liquid,</i>

31:49.599 --> 31:51.767
<i>and it only takes</i>
<i>a couple of minutes</i>

31:51.835 --> 31:54.603
<i>for the bulb's warm glow</i>
<i>to turn into burning shrapnel.</i>

31:58.175 --> 31:59.342
Jacob!

31:59.409 --> 32:00.343
Jacob!

32:00.410 --> 32:01.778
What? What is it?

32:01.845 --> 32:04.748
Please,
I-I can't take this anymore.

32:04.816 --> 32:06.485
Let's just get this
over with.

32:06.552 --> 32:08.855
What?
No, it's not time yet.

32:08.923 --> 32:10.690
Oh, yes, it is.
I-I said my prayers.

32:10.758 --> 32:12.091
I made my peace.
I'm ready.

32:12.159 --> 32:14.860
Soon. I'm sorry,
but you're my plan "B."

32:14.928 --> 32:16.662
If there's a problem
with Sarah's payoff --

32:16.730 --> 32:18.864
don't make me beg!

32:23.738 --> 32:25.872
Just one --
one last request.

32:26.974 --> 32:29.174
One last drink
for the road?

32:46.277 --> 32:47.644
Now...

32:50.348 --> 32:51.315
Not the head.

32:51.383 --> 32:53.154
Not my head.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.023
I deserve an open casket.

32:55.091 --> 32:56.257
Don't I?

32:58.993 --> 33:00.760
Yes, you do, Charlotte.

33:02.129 --> 33:03.029
Yes, you do.

33:06.202 --> 33:07.368
Aah!

33:11.405 --> 33:13.739
My name is not Charlotte,
<i>bitch!</i>

33:14.974 --> 33:15.707
Jacob!

33:18.977 --> 33:20.743
Hi, honey.
I'm home.

33:20.811 --> 33:23.112
Good. You can help me
take out the trash.

33:25.849 --> 33:29.221
<i>Force, power, and torque are</i>
<i>the measure of any sports car.</i>

33:29.288 --> 33:30.589
<i>But on winding roads,</i>

33:30.656 --> 33:33.292
<i>the key to fast driving</i>
<i>is fast braking.</i>

33:33.360 --> 33:34.661
<i>Four-piston disc brakes</i>

33:34.728 --> 33:37.263
<i>will kill speed</i>
<i>quickly and smoothly...</i>

33:38.799 --> 33:40.533
<i>...Allowing you to keep</i>
<i>your foot on the gas longer.</i>

34:06.959 --> 34:08.426
What is this?

34:08.494 --> 34:09.694
"What is this?"

34:09.762 --> 34:12.130
I guess you'd call this
a barter situation.

34:12.197 --> 34:12.931
Where's the money?

34:12.998 --> 34:14.733
I got something better.

34:20.507 --> 34:22.241
In ingles,
por fa-- please.

34:22.308 --> 34:23.976
Actually, it's better
if you just shut up

34:24.043 --> 34:25.878
and put the gun away,
unless you want to find out

34:25.945 --> 34:27.346
what it's like
to be an only child.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.281
Where are you holding him?

34:29.349 --> 34:30.349
Call your brother.
Ask <i>him.</i>

34:47.466 --> 34:48.667
Charlotte speaking.

34:48.734 --> 34:51.101
Wait.
Where's my brother?!

34:51.170 --> 34:53.071
Oh, you know, Jacob can't
come to the phone right now.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.906
He's kind of screwed at the moment.

34:54.974 --> 34:56.641
You put him on,
you little puta!

34:56.708 --> 34:58.109
Careful, Eddy.

34:58.177 --> 35:01.646
This puta has a bomb underneath
your brother's cojones.

35:02.615 --> 35:03.949
Check out that photo
again.

35:04.016 --> 35:06.151
You see
that fire extinguisher?

35:06.218 --> 35:08.720
It's a highly pressurized
hydrogen gas bomb.

35:08.788 --> 35:11.122
So hand over your guns, or your brother's
gonna be more than a little bowlegged.

35:11.190 --> 35:12.090
You won't do it!

35:12.157 --> 35:13.291
You don't got the guts!

35:13.359 --> 35:14.459
You're just
a scrawny little pendeja!

35:17.930 --> 35:19.197
Ooh.

35:19.264 --> 35:20.498
Thank you, Jacob.

35:20.566 --> 35:21.732
Gah!

35:27.238 --> 35:28.906
Gah!

35:28.973 --> 35:30.207
Come on! Move!

35:30.275 --> 35:31.408
Guns, too.

35:39.551 --> 35:40.251
Give!

35:42.220 --> 35:43.754
You know,
you were right.

35:43.821 --> 35:45.555
The best products
really do sell themselves.

35:46.924 --> 35:48.091
GracÃ­as.

35:48.159 --> 35:50.761
Now, how do you say
"not good enough"?

35:50.828 --> 35:53.163
Take a look
at the photo again.

35:53.230 --> 35:56.099
Take a look at the watch, Eddy.
The bomb is on a timer.

35:56.166 --> 35:57.467
15 minutes.

35:57.534 --> 35:59.535
At this point,
I would call the cops.

36:02.605 --> 36:04.305
As I was saying,

36:04.373 --> 36:06.975
I don't think you're gonna
make it there on time.

36:07.042 --> 36:08.743
The smart move
is to call the cops.

36:11.747 --> 36:13.848
What do you expect me
to do -- confess?

36:13.915 --> 36:15.115
Either that

36:15.183 --> 36:16.884
or get a vacuum cleaner
to pick up your brother.

36:16.951 --> 36:18.452
Either way,
I don't really care.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.920
Christian --
where's he --

36:19.988 --> 36:21.621
he's fine.
I'm taking you to him.

36:28.828 --> 36:31.063
So,
what kind of a timer

36:31.131 --> 36:33.367
is attached to a bomb
with duct tape?

36:33.435 --> 36:35.470
You know, your brother
is kind of an idiot.

36:35.538 --> 36:38.278
Vaya con dios, Jacob.

36:38.346 --> 36:40.848
Ooh!
Look at that hole, Sam.

36:40.915 --> 36:42.483
You really <i>do</i> like me,
don't you?

36:42.550 --> 36:45.319
Well, I wouldn't go <i>that</i> far,
but you're growing on me.

36:49.924 --> 36:52.526
You tell Sarah
what an idiot her husband was?

36:52.594 --> 36:53.827
No,
I think she knows.

36:53.895 --> 36:55.161
Yeah,
they always do.

36:55.229 --> 36:56.596
Thanks
for breaking him.

36:57.665 --> 36:59.399
Yeah, well...

36:59.466 --> 37:03.235
Looks like Los Hermanos Grimm
got what was coming to them.

37:03.303 --> 37:04.603
I was listening
on the police band.

37:04.671 --> 37:06.404
They snapped up Jacob,
grabbed Eddy at the airport.

37:06.472 --> 37:09.073
That 911 call's gonna play great
at their trial.

37:09.141 --> 37:13.112
Well, just goes to show you,
man -- payback is a...

37:13.180 --> 37:13.913
Fiona.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.021
You should see the <i>other</i> guy.

37:53.010 --> 37:54.110
Hey.

37:54.111 --> 37:55.144
Hey.

37:55.145 --> 37:56.279
It's kind of late.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.213
You got a hot date?

37:57.214 --> 38:00.015
No. I'm, uh...
Hitting the gym.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.550
Relax, Jesse.

38:01.551 --> 38:03.952
I know you boys
are robbing the bank tonight.

38:03.953 --> 38:05.686
We try not to talk
about our upcoming felonies.

38:05.687 --> 38:06.787
You know.

38:06.788 --> 38:08.489
Some things are
better left unsaid, huh?

38:08.490 --> 38:09.556
Yeah.

38:09.557 --> 38:12.826
Jesse...This might be
one of those things.

38:12.827 --> 38:15.394
Fiona and Michael
love each other,

38:15.395 --> 38:17.897
and they hate
each other.

38:17.898 --> 38:20.165
But it's always...
Each other.

38:20.166 --> 38:22.166
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Why? What -- what --

38:22.167 --> 38:23.634
it's probably nothing.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.938
I just...Saw how upset you were
when Fiona was in trouble.

38:26.939 --> 38:29.741
Well, you know,
Fi's my friend.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.409
I, uh...

38:31.410 --> 38:33.244
Really, I know --
I know she and I aren't, uh...

38:34.813 --> 38:37.081
I just want what's best
for them. That's all.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.215
And I believe you.

38:38.216 --> 38:41.319
You just might want
to work on that poker face.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.492
Bonnie, Clyde.
What's going on?

38:46.493 --> 38:48.428
Nothing. I was
just giving Jesse <i>these.</i>

38:48.429 --> 38:50.096
Fiona took them as a souvenir.

38:50.097 --> 38:52.031
I thought
maybe they'd come in handy.

38:52.032 --> 38:53.399
That's really nice
of you, mom.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.167
Jesse, you ready for the fastest
minute of your life?

38:55.168 --> 38:56.568
Let's do this.

38:57.937 --> 39:00.005
Mrs. Westen.

39:00.006 --> 39:02.073
Thank you.

39:17.985 --> 39:20.452
<i>The security</i>
<i>of a safety-deposit box</i>

Fan out.

39:50.647 --> 39:52.747

There's nobody in here.

39:58.186 --> 40:01.487
Let's see what's behind
door number 64.

40:06.763 --> 40:08.564
Family bible?

40:08.565 --> 40:10.766
That doesn't make
any sense.

40:10.767 --> 40:13.434
The people we're looking for
aren't religious.

40:20.675 --> 40:23.043
It's a book code --
a cipher.

40:23.044 --> 40:24.844
Well, what do you think
it decodes?

40:24.845 --> 40:26.212
I don't know.

40:26.213 --> 40:28.981
But answering that question
is our next move.

Who's Simon?

40:53.905 --> 40:55.438
