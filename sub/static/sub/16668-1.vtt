00:45.600 --> 00:46.720
It's hard not to be impressed

00:46.730 --> 00:50.010
when you see entire houses being swept away

00:50.030 --> 00:51.880
by flood waters in the West

00:51.890 --> 00:53.550
Fires stretch from one end

00:53.560 --> 00:55.010
of Texas to the other.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.090
Tornadoes--

00:56.100 --> 00:59.390
a dozen tornadoes have already been spotted

00:59.400 --> 01:00.920
Liberals will say, well if it's cold,

01:00.930 --> 01:03.130
it's global warming, if it's
snowing it's global warming,

01:03.140 --> 01:05.050
if it's hot it's global
warming-- there's nothing

01:05.060 --> 01:07.010
that doesn't prove that
there's-- it's global warming.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.760
VO-- MSNBC The latest estimates
for rebuilding from Irene,

01:09.780 --> 01:11.590
already seven billion dollars.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.720
2011 is now on track

01:13.730 --> 01:18.260
to be the most expensive year
ever for weather related damage.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.840
A drought of historic proportions has hit Nepal.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.050
The horror

01:23.060 --> 01:25.340
of raging wildfires has
again returned to Russia.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.390
The say it was

01:26.400 --> 01:27.930
like nothing they've ever seen before.

01:27.940 --> 01:33.630
16 of the last 20 years
are the hottest on record.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.220
The science is not in

01:35.230 --> 01:36.470
It is in

01:36.480 --> 01:37.470
No

01:37.480 --> 01:38.140
Stuart quit saying that.

01:38.150 --> 01:39.340
The debate is over.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.380
No, the debate is not over

01:40.400 --> 01:41.210
The globe is actually cooling

01:41.220 --> 01:43.760
and has been cooling since 2002.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.550
The consensus
is that there is no consensus.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.710
I mean how do you not...
global warming

01:49.730 --> 01:50.960
is real.

01:50.970 --> 01:52.220
You're about to self implode here.

01:52.230 --> 01:54.510
The ice caps, the poles,
are not going

01:54.520 --> 01:57.050
to melt, the oceans are not
going to flood the coast --

01:57.060 --> 01:59.050
I promise you, 20 years from today,

01:59.070 --> 02:01.300
I'll be the one that's laughing.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.550
The worst that would happen is

02:20.560 --> 02:22.800
that I'd just get really wet
if I just stood in place.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.130
No.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.430
You fall, you try to run,
you bang your knee on a piece

02:25.440 --> 02:28.390
of ice, and you bust your knee.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.260
Ah, I just--
I have to get this picture.

02:31.270 --> 02:34.260
The first time I worked with James,

02:34.270 --> 02:37.600
It was obvious how he goes
about things, you know?

02:37.610 --> 02:39.340
Alright quickly!

02:39.360 --> 02:42.010
Cause this light won't last forever.

02:42.020 --> 02:44.430
He pushe sit-- 
he's looking for something.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.890
You do have rope in the car?

02:45.900 --> 02:47.100
Yeah.

02:47.110 --> 02:48.560
Go back and get whatever you have.

02:48.570 --> 02:50.130
Okay.

02:50.150 --> 02:51.130
Alright, I'm,

02:51.140 --> 02:53.880
I'm almost certain to get wet, Okay?

02:55.730 --> 02:58.060
In fact, I think I'm so certain to get wet,

02:58.070 --> 03:00.170
I'll take my boots off.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.300
And it was very interesting

03:03.310 --> 03:05.390
because it was his first real encounter

03:05.400 --> 03:08.220
at looking at ice in that way.

03:11.310 --> 03:13.590
He really did fall in love with it.

03:38.230 --> 03:40.630
There's this limitless Universe

03:40.640 --> 03:41.720
of forms out there...

03:41.730 --> 03:48.220
That is just, surreal, other worldly.

03:48.230 --> 03:50.090
Sculptural, architectural...

03:50.100 --> 03:56.720
insanely, ridiculously beautiful.

03:56.730 --> 04:01.920
And that's when I though,
okay, the story is in the ice.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.380
Somehow.

04:22.100 --> 04:26.800
I was umm, about 25 or so, I guess.

04:26.810 --> 04:30.880
And I was finishing my master's
degree in Geomorphology.

04:30.890 --> 04:34.720
And um, I loved the science,

04:34.730 --> 04:37.930
but I wasn't interested in being a scientist.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.050
The modern world of science
was all about statistics

04:41.060 --> 04:45.800
and computer modeling and that just wasn't me.

04:45.810 --> 04:49.050
I had no contacts in the photo world,

04:49.070 --> 04:50.880
I had no knowledge of the photo world.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.550
But, youthful brashness can take you a long way,

04:53.560 --> 04:55.680
make things happen, so, that's how it worked.

04:55.690 --> 05:04.550
I had this idea that the most powerful issue

05:04.560 --> 05:07.760
of our time was the interaction
of humans and nature.

05:07.770 --> 05:14.640
One of the subjects I started to
look at involved people hunting.

05:14.650 --> 05:17.640
But they were bloody, gory,
horrific pictures, hard to look

05:17.650 --> 05:19.300
at-- hard for me to
look at even today.

05:19.320 --> 05:25.510
And so, when I had this idea
to look at endangered wildlife,

05:25.520 --> 05:28.060
I realized that I needed to show these things

05:28.070 --> 05:30.710
in a more seductive fashion.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.090
I had to look at it in ways

05:32.100 --> 05:37.470
that would engage
people-- pull them in.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.710
He's always taken the big view.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.880
You know? He's not looking
at this little micro slice.

05:41.890 --> 05:45.050
He's really looking at what humanity is doing

05:45.060 --> 05:47.970
from a very large perspective.

05:47.980 --> 05:51.050
His books-- they force you
to regard nature in a way

05:51.060 --> 05:54.050
that you're not accustomed to looking at em.

05:54.060 --> 05:54.970
He's forcing you to think.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.090
He's forcing me to think.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.460
And that's what I love about James' work.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.130
You know, Ansel Adams was the father

06:02.140 --> 06:05.050
of all landscape photography
and he created a movement

06:05.060 --> 06:07.680
around wilderness that only images could do.

06:07.690 --> 06:11.630
And now you have James
with that same kind of eye.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.880
But being able to do more with the technology.

06:13.890 --> 06:16.760
It's not just the drive

06:16.770 --> 06:18.560
to climb mountains and hang off cliffs.

06:18.570 --> 06:23.800
He has the ability to capture
it in a way and communicate it.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.390
Observing it and knowing it
is one thing, but sharing it

06:26.400 --> 06:32.720
and sharing it effectively can change the world.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.050
I did a couple years of research

06:34.060 --> 06:35.470
on the climate change story,

06:35.480 --> 06:38.720
trying to find what you could
photograph about climate change

06:38.730 --> 06:40.550
that would make interesting photographs.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.260
And I eventually realized that
the only thing that-- to me--

06:45.270 --> 06:46.550
sounded right, was ice.

06:46.560 --> 06:51.220
He came with us with a proposal

06:51.230 --> 06:54.550
to do a profile of one glacier in Iceland.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.260
We essentially countered
to him, we said, well look,

06:56.270 --> 07:00.300
why don't we just do a bigger story.

07:00.310 --> 07:03.510
It was on the cover of the magazine.

07:03.520 --> 07:08.920
Most popular, most wellread
story in the last five years.

07:08.940 --> 07:10.090
As I was shooting that story,

07:10.100 --> 07:12.300
I started to get the very strong sense

07:12.310 --> 07:15.550
that this was a scouting mission
for something much bigger,

07:15.560 --> 07:19.670
and much longer-term
that was about to unfold.

07:22.140 --> 07:25.430
The Solheim Glacier, the
Sunhouse Glacier in translation,

07:25.440 --> 07:28.140
is where I really first got it.

07:29.530 --> 07:32.800
That glacier had been receding
several hundred feet a year;

07:32.810 --> 07:35.220
which is a lot.

07:35.230 --> 07:38.220
You normally have a little bit
of advance in the winter time,

07:38.230 --> 07:40.420
a little bit of retreat in the summer time;

07:40.430 --> 07:42.800
but when you see huge amounts of change,

07:42.810 --> 07:45.840
that's outside of normal behavior.

07:48.270 --> 07:52.010
There was a real sense of the
glacier just coming to an end;

07:52.020 --> 07:55.840
and like this old, decrepit man, just, you know,

07:55.850 --> 07:57.390
falling into the earth and dying.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.050
It was very evocative, very emotional.

08:05.810 --> 08:07.510
As a guy who's been mountaineering

08:07.520 --> 08:11.010
for basically my whole adult
life, uh, someone whose trained

08:11.020 --> 08:13.470
in the earth sciences, I never imagined

08:13.480 --> 08:16.850
that you could see features
this big disappearing

08:16.860 --> 08:19.670
in such a short period of time.

08:22.060 --> 08:26.300
But when I did-- when I saw
that-- and I realized, my God,

08:26.310 --> 08:29.000
there's a powerful piece
of history that's unfolding

08:29.020 --> 08:33.380
in these pictures and I have
to go back to those same spots.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.220
So, I set up a whole bunch of camera positions

08:37.230 --> 08:39.049
around that glacier where I would just go back

08:39.070 --> 08:40.760
and shoot a single frame.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.929
You know, one in April, one in October,

08:42.940 --> 08:51.970
and we would just see how the
glacier changed in six months.

08:53.190 --> 08:54.470
Right there where Svav is.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.390
Right there.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.220
That's exactly where the ice was.

08:58.230 --> 08:59.000
Right there.

08:59.020 --> 09:00.210
Right? Over.

09:00.220 --> 09:01.510
Uhh, correct, this is where...

09:01.520 --> 09:04.050
That glacier had changed so much, that,

09:04.060 --> 09:06.890
I'm not kidding, for like
three hours, we stood there,

09:06.900 --> 09:09.250
looking at the prints of six months ago,

09:09.270 --> 09:11.220
looking at the glacier going, we must be wrong,

09:11.230 --> 09:12.720
we can't be in the right places.

09:12.730 --> 09:15.680
They appear to be from over there.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.220
And when I saw those, the lights when off

09:52.230 --> 09:54.890
for me, I realized, the
public doesn't wanna hear

09:54.900 --> 09:58.310
about more statistical
studies, more computer models,

09:58.320 --> 10:02.720
more projections-- what
they need is a believable,

10:02.730 --> 10:05.220
understandable piece
of visual evidence--

10:05.230 --> 10:08.390
something that grabs them in the gut.

10:12.390 --> 10:17.390
So I created this project called
the Extreme Ice Survey-- or EIS.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.550
The initial goal was to put

10:18.570 --> 10:21.260
out twenty five cameras for three years.

10:21.270 --> 10:24.720
And they would shoot every hour
as long as it was daylight.

10:24.730 --> 10:27.140
We would download those cameras every so often

10:27.150 --> 10:30.380
and turn those individual
frames into video clips

10:30.390 --> 10:33.840
that would show you how
the landscape was changing.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.470
I thought that basically,

10:36.480 --> 10:39.670
you could just buy all this time
lapse equipment off the shelf,

10:39.680 --> 10:42.680
slam it together and put it out there.

10:42.690 --> 10:44.840
I was so naive about that.

10:44.850 --> 10:47.890
Uh, there was a custom
computer that needed to be built

10:47.900 --> 10:51.130
and there were a thousand little
engineering details that needed

10:51.140 --> 10:52.970
to be worked out and a lot of trial and error,

10:52.980 --> 10:55.140
because people hadn't built this stuff before.

10:55.150 --> 11:04.220
And it was clear to me, it
would have to be a team effort.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.720
I wasn't that into photography,

11:06.730 --> 11:09.760
but I talked him into me coming
up here and having a look.

11:09.780 --> 11:12.340
Cause I was curious and I really
wanted to do whatever I could

11:12.350 --> 11:14.720
to get my foot in the door.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.930
Svav is the field assistant in Iceland.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.510
You ready?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.300
As ready as I can be.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.380
These are more attractive

11:21.390 --> 11:22.720
because I think they're more pictureeqse,

11:22.730 --> 11:24.680
and they're still big glaciers.

11:24.690 --> 11:27.220
Jason has a deep, deep well of experience

11:27.230 --> 11:30.460
about Greenland's glaciers,
about Greenland logistics,

11:30.470 --> 11:32.880
about what the glaciers were doing.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.760
Tad's a glaciologist he's
really the grandfather,

11:35.770 --> 11:40.300
the Godfather the knowledge base
about those glaciers in Alaska.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.300
The scope and the scale of EIS is bigger

11:42.310 --> 11:45.300
than any other project since I've known him.

11:45.310 --> 11:47.890
They would work all day, in our little,

11:47.900 --> 11:50.210
what used to be our garage,
turned into a workshop--

11:50.220 --> 11:53.720
until sometimes, 11, 12 o'clock at night.

11:53.730 --> 11:55.850
James sent me a gear list of things

11:55.860 --> 11:58.710
that I had never heard-- I
mean Ice axes and crampons--

11:58.730 --> 12:00.050
all of this technical climbing gear

12:00.060 --> 12:01.920
that I had never used before.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.970
I remember thinking that I
never want to do ice climbing

12:05.980 --> 12:09.920
or ice related stuff, it's
dangerous, I'm gonna die,

12:09.930 --> 12:13.930
but of course, I still
went with James to Iceland.

12:20.180 --> 12:22.510
Jeez...

12:22.520 --> 12:24.220
What?

12:24.230 --> 12:27.560
I'm just saying Jesus Christ.

12:27.570 --> 12:29.420
I'm just emphasizing how bad the

12:29.430 --> 12:30.970
weather is.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.050
Yeah, I don't need it.

12:34.190 --> 12:35.680
I get it.

12:38.270 --> 12:40.300
The essence of the camera systems is based

12:40.310 --> 12:42.380
on putting really delicate electronics

12:42.390 --> 12:45.640
in the harshest conditions on the planet.

12:45.650 --> 12:48.350
They have to withstand hurricane force winds.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.130
Negative 40 degree temperatures.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.090
It's not the nicest environment

12:52.100 --> 12:56.550
for technology to be sitting out in.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.180
Whatever the dangers of that boulder are,

13:28.190 --> 13:30.420
that's a better spot than this is.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.430
Well we found a place to hide the camera;

13:32.440 --> 13:33.800
that's the good news.

13:33.810 --> 13:36.720
The bad news is we've got a
major engineering project to try

13:36.730 --> 13:39.090
and get that thing anchored and supported.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.380
This thing is loose.

13:40.390 --> 13:43.590
Look how soft this stuff is.

13:43.600 --> 13:51.380
Yeah it's gotta be this section right here.

13:51.390 --> 13:52.130
Uh... The other way around.

13:52.140 --> 13:59.760
Rock! This is fantastic.

13:59.770 --> 14:02.300
Look at this.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.550
It's exactly what we wanted.

14:04.560 --> 14:08.800
Okay.. Well, here we go.

14:08.820 --> 14:12.550
The first eyeballs on the glacier-- finally.

14:12.560 --> 14:21.220
Let's uh, see what a couple years brings to us.

14:21.230 --> 14:22.760
We installed five cameras

14:22.770 --> 14:25.180
in total on that trip.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.810
After that, we went on to Greenland.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.930
When glaciers
break these gigantic icebergs

14:57.940 --> 15:02.380
off into the ocean it's
called calving c-a-l-v-i-n-g.

15:08.980 --> 15:12.050
Ever since glaciers have entered
the ocean, hundreds of thousands

15:12.060 --> 15:15.720
of years ago, ice has always calved off.

15:17.110 --> 15:22.130
But what we're seeing now is the
Greenland ice sheet thinning out

15:22.140 --> 15:38.100
and dumping out ever more
ice and water into the ocean.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.380
Okay good.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.300
Yep. Right up here.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.170
It's sort of like doing a portrait of people.

15:59.180 --> 16:00.880
You know, uh, Richard Avendan

16:00.890 --> 16:05.220
and Irving Penn spent their
entire careers doing portraits

16:05.230 --> 16:08.390
of faces essential, and found endless variation

16:08.400 --> 16:11.220
and endless beauty and endless
magic in those faces and for me,

16:11.230 --> 16:14.590
that's the same thing as what's going on here.

16:17.730 --> 16:22.430
You know you feel this
tension between this huge,

16:22.440 --> 16:27.260
enduring power of these
glaciers and their fragility.

16:27.270 --> 16:30.050
You know, they came from
a great, impassive place,

16:30.060 --> 16:32.340
and they're just, they're crumbling

16:32.350 --> 16:35.680
into these tiny little blocks
of ice going off into the ocean.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.210
It's crazy.

16:49.310 --> 16:51.130
My first trip to Greenland, We were setting

16:51.140 --> 16:53.130
up one of the cameras at Store Glacier.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.050
We got there, we saw this really,

16:55.060 --> 16:57.050
bizarre looking peninsula.

16:57.060 --> 16:59.710
Just kind of perched out at the
front of this-- the calving face

16:59.720 --> 17:01.550
of the glacier, where the glacier ends.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.890
This thing is gonna
break off all summer long man.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.089
Look at this.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.720
Those peninsulas are, are
just a matter of days--

17:07.730 --> 17:09.710
at most, a couple weeks.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.970
It was huge.

17:10.980 --> 17:13.720
It was five football fields
long-- 1,500 feet long.

17:13.730 --> 17:16.890
And about 300 feet above
the surface of the water.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.920
As we're setting up the cameras,
we also set up a video camera,

17:20.930 --> 17:23.380
and had it pointed right
there, at that peninsula,

17:23.390 --> 17:24.720
and we just had it rolling.

17:24.730 --> 17:29.210
Just in case.

17:29.220 --> 17:36.970
Oh my God,
a giant crack just formed.

17:39.970 --> 17:43.890
See that whole island, it's going away.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.470
There it goes man.

18:18.150 --> 18:19.090
We were there

18:19.100 --> 18:21.840
for just a one hour period of time.

18:21.850 --> 18:25.850
And, absurdly, somehow
fortunately captured an event

18:25.860 --> 18:31.550
that seldom is caught on film.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.890
There is this
really big stuff happening right

18:33.900 --> 18:37.060
under our noses, happening right now.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.840
But I feel like time is clicking, you know.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.670
And we need to get these cameras out here.

19:11.730 --> 19:13.720
Okay.
Onward.

19:13.730 --> 19:14.550
The logistics

19:14.560 --> 19:16.680
of things are just like, crazy.

19:16.690 --> 19:20.920
It reminds you how far he's
willing to take an idea.

19:20.930 --> 19:22.590
Heads up!

19:22.600 --> 19:24.260
Heads up!

19:31.390 --> 19:34.050
Tight, tight tight.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
This is tonight's dinner,

20:05.610 --> 20:11.470
I just found out.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.350
Eight.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.670
Seven. Six, Five.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.050
Ah!

20:39.060 --> 20:45.930
This is the way to travel, my friend.

20:54.150 --> 20:57.600
We ended up installing about
a dozen cameras in Greenland,

20:57.610 --> 21:02.550
five in Iceland, five in
Alaska and two in Montana.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.590
Frankly, I can't believe we actually managed

21:04.600 --> 21:06.430
to pull this off.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.430
You know, about 20 years ago,

21:16.440 --> 21:19.590
I was a skeptic about climate change.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.420
I thought is was based on computer models,

21:21.430 --> 21:23.380
I thought maybe there was a lot of hyperbole

21:23.390 --> 21:27.810
that was turning this into an activist cause.

21:27.820 --> 21:31.880
But most importantly, I didn't
think that humans were capable

21:31.890 --> 21:34.800
of changing the basic physics and chemistry

21:34.810 --> 21:37.430
of this entire huge planet.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.630
It didn't seem probable,
it didn't seem possible.

21:42.640 --> 21:47.390
And then I learned about the
record that's in the ice cores.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.380
The history of ancient climate

21:49.390 --> 21:52.220
that was embedded in those cores.

21:52.230 --> 21:56.720
And the story that the glaciers were telling.

21:56.730 --> 21:57.960
The Greenland

21:57.980 --> 22:00.220
and Antarctic ice sheets
are these giant domes of ice

22:00.230 --> 22:04.050
that preserve climate records,
very much like tree rings.

22:04.060 --> 22:08.630
Snow is added to the top, turns into ice,

22:08.650 --> 22:13.340
and ice core scientist can drill
holes through the ice sheets

22:13.350 --> 22:17.260
and pull out a core and
examine, not only the ice,

22:17.270 --> 22:22.510
but also bubbles of ancient air
that are trapped in the ice.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.180
By looking at the chemistry
of the ice, we can learn

22:25.190 --> 22:27.680
about past temperature,
and by looking at the air,

22:27.690 --> 22:30.550
we can actually measure
the carbon dioxide content.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.340
One of the things that we
learn, is that past temperature

22:33.350 --> 22:35.010
and carbon dioxide vary together.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.140
They go up together, they go down together.

22:38.150 --> 22:43.550
And over the last 800,000 years or so,

22:43.560 --> 22:45.720
atmospheric carbon dioxide was never higher

22:45.730 --> 22:49.380
that about 280 parts per million.

22:49.390 --> 22:53.890
Until we started adding carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.220
And now it's about 390 parts per million.

22:56.230 --> 22:59.130
And that's about 40 percent higher than it was

22:59.140 --> 23:02.630
when carbon dioxide was only
varying for natural reasons.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.890
But now we're heading for 500
parts per million or more.

23:05.900 --> 23:10.170
That pace is a 100 to 1000 times greater

23:10.180 --> 23:11.970
than the pace at which things have changed

23:11.980 --> 23:13.550
by themselves, naturally.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.600
The amazing thing to me is that
we're already seeing impacts

23:16.610 --> 23:18.880
because the change already
has been so small, right?

23:18.900 --> 23:20.670
It's been .8 degrees C,

23:20.680 --> 23:24.050
about 1.5 degrees
Farenheit since 1850 or so.

23:24.060 --> 23:27.470
And yet we've seen so much stuff...

23:27.480 --> 23:28.760
crazy stuff going on already.

23:28.780 --> 23:34.930
What counts
to me more than the notion

23:34.940 --> 23:38.550
of the climate changing, is
that the air is changing.

23:38.570 --> 23:42.220
The air that we live in,
the air that sustains us,

23:42.230 --> 23:45.680
the basic physics and chemistry
of that air is changing.

23:45.690 --> 23:50.550
This is about the stuff that you and I breath.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.260
And that effects everything in the agriculture

23:53.270 --> 23:58.550
and the water supply of all the
plants and animals around us.

23:58.570 --> 23:59.550
Plants

23:59.560 --> 24:01.010
and animals are already going extinct.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.300
They're going extinct a 100 times faster now

24:03.310 --> 24:04.720
than they did 1000 years ago.

24:04.730 --> 24:08.050
And as the climate continues to
warm, we're going to loose more

24:08.070 --> 24:09.880
and more, and more species because we're going

24:09.890 --> 24:11.840
to have more suppresses happening.

24:11.850 --> 24:14.260
We're going to have a mass extinction event

24:14.270 --> 24:16.970
that could happen within
the next 200 to 300 years.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.090
Mass extinction event means that we loose half,

24:20.100 --> 24:22.800
or maybe three quarters of the number of species

24:22.810 --> 24:25.300
that we have on the planet.

24:25.310 --> 24:28.630
Are we going to be loosing the
plants that clean our water?

24:28.650 --> 24:30.920
The plants that clean our air?

24:30.930 --> 24:33.130
If there's no pollinators
out there to pollinate,

24:33.140 --> 24:34.800
then we're going to have to do it by hand.

24:34.810 --> 24:37.350
And they're already doing that
in China-- having to go out

24:37.360 --> 24:44.260
and pollinate their crops by hand.

24:44.270 --> 24:46.680
In the last 20 years, we have lost,

24:46.690 --> 24:50.220
close to 20 percent of the forest area

24:50.230 --> 24:51.680
in Arizona-New Mexico.

24:51.690 --> 24:56.550
And that's a high mortality
in those forest areas.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.590
We have seen an increasing in
the length of the fire season

24:59.600 --> 25:02.090
by more than two
months; larger fires

25:02.100 --> 25:04.390
in the Western United
States in the last 20 years;

25:04.400 --> 25:09.050
and we've seen hotter fires
- more extreme fires burning.

25:09.060 --> 25:12.430
It's not just by chance that
I'm seeing many rare events

25:12.440 --> 25:14.890
happening all in sequence, you know.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.180
There's a reason for that.

25:16.190 --> 25:24.680
We're seeing extraordinary
changes in our environment.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.260
Munich Re is the world's largest

25:27.270 --> 25:30.420
re-insurance company and
our business model is

25:30.430 --> 25:33.930
to provide insurance for
the insurance companies.

25:33.940 --> 25:39.880
As Munich Re is a major
reinsurer for natural perils,

25:39.890 --> 25:42.010
natural catastrophes; we need

25:42.020 --> 25:47.220
to know the risks as best as we can.

25:47.230 --> 25:50.550
We have discovered some trends in the number

25:50.560 --> 25:54.510
and in the losses natural perils have caused.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.510
And, interestingly, for
the weather related events,

25:57.520 --> 26:01.420
our activities-- primarily
greenhouse gas emissions--

26:01.430 --> 26:06.260
are contributing to more
intense and more events.

26:06.270 --> 26:08.880
It cannot be acclaimed by just better reporting,

26:08.900 --> 26:11.380
it has to be explained by changes

26:11.390 --> 26:16.140
in the atmospheric conditions.

26:16.150 --> 26:18.050
Imagine a base ball player on steroids

26:18.070 --> 26:20.380
who steps up to the plate and hits a home run.

26:20.390 --> 26:24.930
Can you attribute that home
run to his taking steroids?

26:24.940 --> 26:27.220
Well steroids occur naturally
in very small amounts

26:27.230 --> 26:29.760
in your system, but by adding just a little bit

26:29.770 --> 26:32.010
of those steroids, you can
change your background physical

26:32.020 --> 26:34.510
state and increase your
chances for enhanced performance

26:34.520 --> 26:36.600
and that's exactly what
happens in the climate system.

26:36.610 --> 26:39.550
Greenhouse gases occur in very
small amounts but by increasing

26:39.560 --> 26:41.970
that just a little bit, you
change the background state

26:41.980 --> 26:49.010
of the system and make it much more susceptible

26:49.020 --> 26:50.380
to increased extremes.

26:50.390 --> 26:51.590
If you had an abcess in your tooth,

26:51.600 --> 26:53.840
would you keep going to dentist after dentist

26:53.850 --> 26:55.890
until you found a dentist that said,

26:55.900 --> 26:57.100
ahhh, don't worry about it.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.210
Leave that rotten tooth in.

26:58.230 --> 27:00.550
Or would you pull it out because more

27:00.560 --> 27:02.760
of the other dentists told
you you had a problem?

27:02.770 --> 27:07.550
That's sort of what we're
doing with Climate Change.

27:07.570 --> 27:12.010
We'll be arguing about this for centuries.

27:12.020 --> 27:15.140
We're still arguing about a
minor thing called evolution,

27:15.150 --> 27:17.590
a minor thing about whether man
actually walked on the moon.

27:17.610 --> 27:24.510
We don't have time.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.680
We have low oil pressure

27:45.690 --> 27:47.100
in engine number two.

27:47.110 --> 27:50.550
So I've shut down engine number two.

27:54.270 --> 27:59.090
We cannot hover with one engine.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.550
You look out
that window at that sea water

28:01.560 --> 28:04.220
with icebergs floating around in
there and you realize if we go

28:04.230 --> 28:08.130
in that, we'll have five
minutes of physical function

28:08.150 --> 28:13.510
and in 10 minutes we're dead.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.260
The fire brigade will be on standby

28:15.270 --> 28:17.710
in case we need their help.

28:50.890 --> 28:53.090
He needs to do his adventures.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.050
That's what makes him who he is.

28:55.060 --> 28:57.310
That's who the man is, that's who I married.

28:57.320 --> 29:02.430
Do I wish sometimes that it was closer

29:02.440 --> 29:04.640
and he would come home at five o'clock?

29:04.650 --> 29:05.720
As a wife, yes.

29:05.730 --> 29:14.050
As a human being, it needs to continue, so.

29:14.060 --> 29:15.970
He's on this never ending quest

29:15.980 --> 29:19.260
for something.

29:19.270 --> 29:22.840
He's just going and hoping that something

29:22.850 --> 29:26.050
that he's doing is taking
him in the right direction

29:26.060 --> 29:27.880
and I think that EIS is it.

29:27.900 --> 29:34.970
He's looking to make a global, worldwide impact.

29:34.980 --> 29:39.050
I've never seen him so passionate

29:39.060 --> 29:41.630
about a project before.

29:56.570 --> 29:58.380
Alright, this way.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.590
It's my job to go out there every couple

30:00.600 --> 30:02.760
of months to visit the cameras.

30:02.770 --> 30:05.640
To go over is everything is okay.

30:07.320 --> 30:12.220
There was always a possibility
that this would happen.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.970
This just-- this whole
piece must have cracked off

30:15.980 --> 30:20.510
in one part; flew off
into whoever knows where.

30:20.520 --> 30:24.220
The rock obviously did not read our warning.

30:24.230 --> 30:25.890
It's only shot eight pictures

30:25.900 --> 30:30.630
in the past 24 hours which is somewhat weird.

30:30.640 --> 30:37.510
In fact it's very weird.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.050
It--
It could still shoot.

30:39.060 --> 30:40.720
Come on, please.

30:40.730 --> 30:41.720
Please work.

30:41.730 --> 30:43.140
It's dead.

30:43.150 --> 30:44.010
It has to be dead.

30:44.020 --> 30:46.600
Okay, so...

30:46.610 --> 30:50.470
Everything we're
trying is getting thwarted.

30:56.110 --> 31:00.670
Again. Zebras again.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.220
Ohhhhh.

31:03.230 --> 31:04.550
We've had numerous,

31:04.560 --> 31:07.840
numerous timer failures.

31:07.860 --> 31:11.880
We've had cameras buried
under 15 or 20 feet of snow.

31:11.890 --> 31:13.390
Ewwww.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.760
Oh my.

31:14.770 --> 31:17.670
We've had Plexiglas windows sand blasted

31:17.690 --> 31:20.880
We've had batteries explode
inside the camera boxes.

31:20.890 --> 31:22.510
I think it's a bird just kind

31:22.520 --> 31:23.840
of pecking away at it.

31:23.850 --> 31:27.220
This is what a fox does to your cables

31:27.230 --> 31:28.460
when you're not looking.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.720
He had spent a lot of many-- grants,

31:30.730 --> 31:33.470
personal money, getting to
Alaska, getting to Greenland

31:33.480 --> 31:35.300
and when you go out there, you want it to work,

31:35.310 --> 31:38.670
and when something doesn't work,
you feel so far from anything

31:38.680 --> 31:41.510
and anyone that can help you.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.970
I think It's in that voltage regulator.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.550
All of that obsession means absolutely nothing

31:55.560 --> 31:59.760
if a little electronic
piece that big doesn't work.

32:00.980 --> 32:03.180
If I don't have pictures, I don't have anything.

32:03.190 --> 32:05.930
You know, everything is a failure.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.710
No, it's dead, it's not working.

32:07.730 --> 32:10.840
Period, flat out, just dead.

32:10.850 --> 32:12.260
It's dead.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.760
God, after all this!

32:14.770 --> 32:17.710
After all this, it just
- it makes me insane!

32:17.730 --> 32:20.670
It makes me fucking insane!

32:22.640 --> 32:27.420
It's so disappointing.

32:27.440 --> 32:35.800
It's hard to see somebody that you love chase

32:35.810 --> 32:37.710
after something that...

32:37.730 --> 32:40.130
might not ever happen.

33:18.220 --> 33:20.130
See that white dot down there...

33:20.140 --> 33:21.340
There's a white dot on the...

33:21.350 --> 33:25.970
Something's happening inside the timer.

33:25.980 --> 33:28.130
After months of trouble shooting,

33:28.150 --> 33:30.050
we realized that the core problem was

33:30.060 --> 33:33.050
in the voltage regulator and
in this little computer timer--

33:33.060 --> 33:37.390
this custom made computer that
told the cameras when to fire.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.420
We worked with these guys

33:38.430 --> 33:40.590
at National Geographic, and we sat down

33:40.600 --> 33:42.180
and re-designed the controllers.

33:42.190 --> 33:45.140
We switched
to an entirely different kind

33:45.150 --> 33:48.760
of a circuit that used less
power and is a lot more reliable

33:48.770 --> 33:53.260
because it has a simpler
electronic circuitry inside it.

33:53.270 --> 33:55.010
That was the turning point

33:55.020 --> 33:57.710
for the whole system.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.760
We had to replace all the old timers.

33:59.770 --> 34:03.550
And had to wait for a whole
season to check on them again

34:03.560 --> 34:06.050
and make sure they were working.

34:56.730 --> 34:59.470
We gotta be getting close.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.420
We are.

35:00.430 --> 35:06.810
We'll be able to see it from up here.

35:06.820 --> 35:07.920
Yeah.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.720
Okay.

35:12.730 --> 35:20.130
Alright. This is the big one;
Okay.

35:22.900 --> 35:23.840
Here it goes.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.390
Playback.

35:30.680 --> 35:31.800
March.

35:31.810 --> 35:34.390
11, 2008. It just shot!

35:39.850 --> 35:43.300
It's been working all winter!

35:43.310 --> 35:44.970
Ahhh man. Hello!

35:44.980 --> 35:47.050
I can't believe that worked.

35:47.070 --> 35:49.510
Do you know how cold it's
been out here, for how long?

35:49.520 --> 35:51.720
I'm unbelievably surprised.

35:51.730 --> 35:54.930
We have over 2,300 frames.

35:54.940 --> 35:55.680
Since June?

35:55.690 --> 35:57.960
Let me see.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.260
And everything's working.

36:24.730 --> 36:26.930
It's been shooting the entire time...

36:26.940 --> 36:32.010
Fantastic.

36:32.020 --> 36:34.140
Here's the memory of the
camera and this is-- actually,

36:34.150 --> 36:35.760
that's an interesting thought.

36:35.770 --> 36:37.840
This is the memory of the landscape.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.550
That landscape is gone.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.090
It may never be seen again in
the history of civilization

36:42.100 --> 36:45.890
and it's stored right here.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.670
In 1984, the glacier was
down there, 11 miles away.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.840
And today, it's back here.

37:00.850 --> 37:03.390
It receded 11 miles.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.010
The glacier's retreating,

37:06.020 --> 37:07.880
but it's also thinning at the same time.

37:07.900 --> 37:09.550
It's like the air being let out of a balloon.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.430
You can see what's
called the trim line--

37:12.440 --> 37:16.720
it's the high water mark of the glacier in 1984.

37:16.730 --> 37:19.670
That vertical change is the height

37:19.680 --> 37:22.680
of the Empire State Building.

37:34.940 --> 37:39.340
You know, we're really in the
midst of geologic scale change.

37:39.350 --> 37:42.890
You know our brains are programed to think

37:42.900 --> 37:45.430
that geology is something
that happened a long time ago

37:45.440 --> 37:47.590
or it will happen a long time in the future.

37:47.610 --> 37:50.720
And we don't think that can
happen during these little years

37:50.730 --> 37:52.840
that we each live on this planet.

37:52.850 --> 37:56.180
But the reality is that it does.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.630
That things can happen very, very very quickly.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.050
We're living through one of those moments

38:01.060 --> 38:03.970
of epochal geologic change right now.

38:03.980 --> 38:06.760
And we humans are causing it.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.510
Up and down the edges of the ice sheet,

38:42.520 --> 38:45.140
there's this zone called the melt zone.

38:45.150 --> 38:49.840
This is where the sheet is
melting and that stored water

38:49.850 --> 38:53.050
from the ice sheet is running out to sea.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.800
I have to wrap my knees
for the day's festivities.

39:07.810 --> 39:11.260
This knee has had two surgeries on it already

39:11.270 --> 39:14.350
and it really could use a third.

39:16.730 --> 39:19.220
It's like the surface of the moon.

39:19.230 --> 39:22.260
Look at those holes.

39:33.850 --> 39:35.100
Oh my gosh, look at this stuff!

39:35.110 --> 39:37.710
I had no idea it was so thick in here.

39:37.730 --> 39:41.220
This stuff, this cryoconite,
it's made from a combination

39:41.230 --> 39:43.510
of natural dust that blows in from the deserts

39:43.520 --> 39:48.510
of central Asia, mixed with
little flakes of carbon,

39:48.520 --> 39:53.220
Fine particles of soot that come
from wildfires, diesel exhaust

39:53.230 --> 39:54.760
and coal-fired power plants.

39:54.770 --> 39:58.050
And on top of it, there's algae
that grows out here and all

39:58.060 --> 40:00.720
of that stuff accumulates in these little holes,

40:00.730 --> 40:04.300
and because it's black, it
absorbs the sun's heat more

40:04.310 --> 40:05.810
than the surrounding ice does.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.050
And all over the surface of the ice sheet,

40:08.060 --> 40:10.380
there's literally billions

40:10.390 --> 40:13.390
of these little cryoconite holes melting away

40:13.400 --> 40:15.220
and filling up with water.

40:15.230 --> 40:17.840
And when you look down at those holes,

40:17.850 --> 40:20.170
what you can actually see
is these little bubbles

40:20.180 --> 40:29.220
of ancient air being released
as the ice sheet melts.

40:32.190 --> 40:34.350
The part of Greenland that's melting,

40:34.360 --> 40:36.180
is out on the edges of the ice sheet.

40:36.190 --> 40:39.550
And that area is growing, and it's moving higher

40:39.560 --> 40:40.800
up onto the ice sheet.

40:40.810 --> 40:44.300
As the climate changes in
that part of the world.

40:44.310 --> 40:46.720
You see, all this water, melting

40:46.730 --> 40:49.220
down through these swiss cheese
holes, you see it melting

40:49.230 --> 40:50.630
down through the channels,

40:50.640 --> 40:52.220
from little channels into big channels.

40:52.230 --> 40:55.430
And eventually, everything drops vertically,

40:55.440 --> 40:58.840
down through these big Moulin caverns.

40:58.850 --> 41:00.550
Goes down to the bottom of the ice sheet

41:00.560 --> 41:02.550
and out into the ocean.

41:05.900 --> 41:06.840
Ordinarily,

41:06.860 --> 41:08.130
if you make climate a little warmer,

41:08.140 --> 41:09.760
the glacier shrinks a little bit.

41:09.770 --> 41:11.630
If you make the climate a little colder,

41:11.640 --> 41:12.840
the glacier grows a little bit.

41:12.900 --> 41:16.920
And those two things kind
of work to maintain balance.

41:16.940 --> 41:19.220
But if it gets too warm,
and the ice gets too thin,

41:19.230 --> 41:23.340
it doesn't just respond just a
little bit, the volume drops.

41:23.350 --> 41:26.260
You cross that tipping point,
climate no longer matters.

41:26.270 --> 41:29.880
It's irreversible-- it's
just gonna keep going.

41:29.890 --> 41:32.550
The sea level rise that will happen

41:32.560 --> 41:35.600
in my daughter's lifetimes,
will be somewhere between a foot

41:35.610 --> 41:36.920
in a half and a half and three feet.

41:36.940 --> 41:40.130
Minimum. That doesn't sound
like a lot if you live

41:40.140 --> 41:43.430
in the Rocky Mountains, but if
you live down in Chesapeake Bay,

41:43.440 --> 41:45.600
along the Gulf Coast of the United States,

41:45.610 --> 41:48.340
in the Ganges flood plane
- that matters a lot.

41:48.350 --> 41:51.550
It matters in China, it matters in Indonesia.

41:51.560 --> 41:55.930
A minimum of 150 million
people will be displaced--

41:55.940 --> 41:58.710
that's like approximately half
the size of the United States.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.430
And all of those people are
going to be flushed out and have

42:01.440 --> 42:03.840
to move somewhere else.

42:03.900 --> 42:08.010
It also intensifies the impact
of hurricanes and typhoons.

42:08.020 --> 42:11.090
It means that there's a lot
more high water along the coast

42:11.100 --> 42:13.340
lines, so when these big storms come,

42:13.350 --> 42:17.260
it pushes that much more water
that much further inland.

42:18.390 --> 42:19.840
That's where our story

42:19.850 --> 42:21.760
of Greenland Climate Change is expressed,

42:21.770 --> 42:24.550
it's in that melt water,
rushing out to the ocean.

42:24.560 --> 42:27.420
That's what we're photographing;
that's what I've been

42:27.440 --> 42:30.550
up there trying to document.

43:03.650 --> 43:05.930
You know, I've
seen this thing from your photos

43:05.940 --> 43:08.380
and sat pictures, but to
be here, it's incredible.

43:08.390 --> 43:12.430
It's all becoming a little more real.

43:12.440 --> 43:15.140
While we're heading over, why don't I walk over

43:15.150 --> 43:16.800
and give you some scale?

43:16.820 --> 43:18.170
Sure.

43:18.180 --> 43:21.050
Just be careful, don't get too
close to the edge, alright?

43:21.060 --> 43:23.180
Stay up where it's flat.

43:24.650 --> 43:27.670
This is really something.

43:27.680 --> 43:31.050
This is terrifying.

43:31.060 --> 43:33.640
This isn't a 10 foot
little hole in the ground,

43:33.650 --> 43:37.630
it's 100 feet deep into an abyss.

43:37.650 --> 43:40.470
If you don't have that,
that little dot of a person

43:40.480 --> 43:43.300
for scale, then it's lost.

43:43.310 --> 43:45.180
That is fabulous.

43:45.190 --> 43:47.760
This is a reasonable route right here.

43:47.780 --> 43:48.710
Look at that.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.720
Oh yeah.

43:49.730 --> 43:50.800
That's like a gift.

43:50.810 --> 43:51.550
This is the danger spot.

43:51.560 --> 43:52.390
Yeah.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.510
For sure.

43:53.520 --> 43:54.550
Well, and the other danger is

43:54.560 --> 43:55.970
that the whole thing suddenly implodes

43:55.980 --> 43:57.260
and the entire thing collapses,

43:57.280 --> 43:59.970
but I don't think that's very likely.

44:02.400 --> 44:05.640
This moulin is
one of thousands of moulins all

44:05.650 --> 44:07.960
over the melt zone in Greenland and everyday,

44:07.970 --> 44:09.720
the ice is cooking down,

44:09.730 --> 44:12.050
and water is pouring into the ice sheet.

44:12.060 --> 44:13.850
It's enormous, you can't wrap your head

44:13.900 --> 44:19.010
around how much water is coming off this place.

44:19.060 --> 44:23.550
You got it.

44:23.560 --> 44:31.880
Adam, have you ever done something

44:31.890 --> 44:34.010
like this before?

44:34.020 --> 44:36.350
No. Not at all.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.170
It's all calculated risks.

44:49.230 --> 44:51.300
It's not like we're just going out there

44:51.310 --> 44:59.380
and playing Russian Roulette.

44:59.390 --> 45:01.470
Piece o'cake.

45:01.480 --> 45:08.550
Ohhh, there's all sorts of curios crinkling

45:08.560 --> 45:11.050
and crunching effects in my knee.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.840
Just not what the doctor ordered.

45:20.640 --> 45:25.180
Alright. Look down!

45:31.060 --> 45:32.220
Look down?

45:32.230 --> 45:33.720
Look! Down!

45:33.730 --> 45:39.260
It's just bottomless...

45:39.270 --> 45:42.680
Oh my God.

45:42.690 --> 45:46.180
I do not want to go any lower than this.

45:46.230 --> 45:48.630
I'm going out here on this broken fin.

45:48.640 --> 45:53.340
Okay? And I don't, I
assume it won't collapse.

46:08.930 --> 46:09.840
Okay.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.260
All done!

46:11.270 --> 46:13.550
Oh thank God!

46:13.560 --> 46:16.180
Fantastic!

46:27.930 --> 46:32.430
There were audible chunks
of gravel like substances

46:32.440 --> 46:35.010
that I could feel rolling around in there.

46:35.060 --> 46:37.340
The bionic man.

46:37.400 --> 46:40.550
I was covering up the soreness
with anti-inflammatories

46:40.560 --> 46:42.840
and pain killers so that I
could function in the field

46:42.900 --> 46:45.300
and I would think, ah, that's
pretty good-- not so bad.

46:45.310 --> 46:48.300
Not realizing that the drugs
were masking the symptoms way

46:48.310 --> 46:50.840
more than I had realized.

46:51.850 --> 46:52.550
Bye babe.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.890
I love you.

46:53.900 --> 46:57.880
I love you too.

47:08.770 --> 47:10.010
More

47:10.020 --> 47:11.510
and more people are becoming
increasingly skeptical

47:11.520 --> 47:13.510
about the existence of climate change.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.760
These so called
climate scientists are

47:15.770 --> 47:17.960
hoodwinking the entire world community.

47:17.970 --> 47:20.220
There is no consensus, this is a myth.

47:20.230 --> 47:21.760
The notion that man made gas,

47:21.770 --> 47:25.350
this anthropogenic gas, this C02
cause global warming is probably

47:25.400 --> 47:27.130
the greatest hoax ever perpetrated

47:27.150 --> 47:28.170
on the American people.

47:29.600 --> 47:37.380
All of this garbage science has
been a total fraud and a fake!

47:40.180 --> 47:41.970
Jim was told after his surgery

47:41.980 --> 47:44.100
that hiking is not a form of exercise

47:44.110 --> 47:46.340
that they want him to pursue anymore.

47:46.360 --> 47:55.350
I'm not sure that's sunken in quite yet.

47:57.470 --> 48:00.380
I think, when we started out,

48:00.390 --> 48:02.260
the glacier was approximately right here.

48:02.270 --> 48:04.470
It might of been there, it might of been here;

48:04.480 --> 48:07.010
but it's in this zone somewhere.

48:12.060 --> 48:13.600
Look. Look at this.

48:13.610 --> 48:17.710
In '05, you couldn't even look
into the canyon back there,

48:17.720 --> 48:19.920
look, it was all filled up to that point.

48:19.930 --> 48:23.850
And look how, look how low it is now.

48:32.020 --> 48:38.510
Beautiful.

48:38.520 --> 48:44.180
And that's 2007--
that isn't even 2005.

48:44.190 --> 48:48.630
In 2007, just two years
ago, you couldn't see any

48:48.640 --> 48:50.470
of that mountain ridge over there.

48:50.480 --> 48:53.010
The thing has deflated tremendously, I mean,

48:53.020 --> 48:56.010
I don't know what the number
of feet is, but, it's a lot.

48:56.070 --> 49:00.130
If I hadn't seen it in the pictures,

49:00.140 --> 49:02.340
I wouldn't believe it at all.

49:24.110 --> 49:28.090
When I saw that
glacier dying, it was like, wow.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.170
You know we, uh...

49:29.230 --> 49:32.930
If a glacier that's been here for 30,000 years,

49:32.940 --> 49:37.090
or 100,000 years is literally
dying in front of my eyes,

49:37.110 --> 49:45.760
you're very aware of the fact that...

49:45.770 --> 49:50.970
You know, sometime you um...

49:50.980 --> 50:06.170
sometime you go out over the
horizon and you don't come back.

50:10.060 --> 50:13.340
James is now
doing exactly what his doctors

50:13.350 --> 50:16.710
said he shouldn't be doing.

50:22.730 --> 50:23.640
Lower.

50:31.560 --> 50:33.970
Oh, man.

50:33.980 --> 50:36.880
A little more...

50:36.900 --> 50:37.630
Okay...

50:42.060 --> 50:44.140
Yes...there you go.

50:56.110 --> 50:58.590
It feels worse this morning

50:58.600 --> 51:02.050
than it has any day since the surgery.

51:02.060 --> 51:04.800
It felt better the three days after the surgery

51:04.810 --> 51:06.710
than it feels right now.

51:06.730 --> 51:12.510
I think that the best that
can be said about this is,

51:12.520 --> 51:14.260
ah I'm a safety liability.

51:14.270 --> 51:18.010
Well, you can
maybe limp your way up, but...

51:18.060 --> 51:19.840
you can't go down that.

51:19.890 --> 51:21.050
Unless you're in a wheelchair.

51:21.060 --> 51:24.680
I mean, we need to go up there--

51:24.690 --> 51:27.300
check on the camera, and all of that, but...

51:27.310 --> 51:29.550
but you don't necessarily need to do it.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.380
I mean, that's more of a climb

51:31.390 --> 51:33.340
than we did in the past two days.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.260
I have a hard
time letting ideas go, you know?

51:35.270 --> 51:37.260
Well here's another thing.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.760
That's why your knee's like this.

51:38.770 --> 51:40.180
Okay.

51:40.190 --> 51:43.090
I'm inclined to think that you
guys should at least go and look

51:43.100 --> 51:44.850
at one of the cameras
- get it downloaded,

51:44.900 --> 51:46.670
get the computer changed today.

51:46.730 --> 51:47.420
Okay?

51:47.430 --> 51:48.130
Yep.

51:48.140 --> 51:52.010
Enough

51:55.730 --> 52:04.510
See the route?

52:11.770 --> 52:12.930
Okay.

52:12.940 --> 52:22.300
Hold on. See if you
can get in there.

52:22.310 --> 52:24.350
That's it!

52:29.770 --> 52:32.840
Let's get out of here.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.840
Every once in a while,

52:40.890 --> 52:42.840
I get this thing in the back of my head saying,

52:42.850 --> 52:44.510
what were you thinking?

52:44.560 --> 52:47.800
Maybe that office job wasn't so bad.

52:49.100 --> 52:50.340
But...

52:50.390 --> 52:52.010
The sandwiches are better here.

52:52.020 --> 52:53.050
The after the sandwich,

52:53.060 --> 52:55.310
I'm totally happy to be here.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.460
This project is...

52:57.470 --> 52:59.760
now we're two years in.

52:59.770 --> 53:02.680
We have like, hundreds of thousands of images.

53:02.730 --> 53:03.850
It feels like, yeah,

53:03.860 --> 53:05.680
he goes to that point where he can't anymore

53:05.730 --> 53:07.920
and sometimes you even feel
he's going even further.

53:07.930 --> 53:09.840
Yeah and he speaks about it, he says, well,

53:09.850 --> 53:12.640
so I'll just do a fourth knee surgery, you know?

53:12.650 --> 53:16.010
Like, however many it takes to keep him going.

53:16.020 --> 53:18.510
Like most people say, I'm
going to get knee surgery

53:18.520 --> 53:19.970
to fix me, kind of, you know?

53:19.980 --> 53:21.130
It's to make it better.

53:21.140 --> 53:23.850
But for him, it's to make
it better so he can keep

53:23.900 --> 53:26.800
on pushing it, destroying it, basically,

53:26.820 --> 53:35.850
and then maybe he'll just have to do it again.

53:40.100 --> 53:46.880
Okay Svav, you
ready for another exposure?

53:46.900 --> 53:51.260
Do it exactly as you just did it, okay?

53:51.270 --> 53:52.640
You ready?

53:52.650 --> 53:54.300
So as
quick as I can, I, I cover it.

53:54.310 --> 53:55.600
That's right.

53:55.610 --> 53:57.420
Way back, early in my career,

53:57.430 --> 53:59.800
I discovered that there was
really something special

53:59.810 --> 54:04.010
about photographing at
night, that places your mind

54:04.020 --> 54:12.680
on the surface of a planet.

54:12.690 --> 54:15.010
You're no longer just a human being walking

54:15.070 --> 54:16.300
around in the regular world.

54:16.320 --> 54:21.590
You are a human animal,
striding around on the surface

54:21.600 --> 54:27.630
of the planet that's out in
the middle of the galaxy.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.880
We as a culture--
we're forgetting

54:29.890 --> 54:32.510
that we are actually natural organisms

54:32.520 --> 54:34.890
and that we have this very, very deep connection

54:34.900 --> 54:36.630
and contact with, and contact with nature.

54:36.650 --> 54:40.180
You can't divorce civilization from nature.

54:40.190 --> 54:44.680
We totally depend on it.

55:23.440 --> 55:24.550
Shortly after that,

55:24.560 --> 55:28.340
he sent us on this month long, massive trip,

55:28.390 --> 55:31.800
to a place that's really hard to get to,

55:31.810 --> 55:36.140
to get a shot that's is just--
it was such a shot in the dark.

55:37.520 --> 55:41.840
The idea sprung from this
one glacier called Store.

55:41.900 --> 55:44.890
That event was so spectacular, we decided,

55:44.900 --> 55:48.220
okay we got to go back,
and go to the big glacier,

55:48.230 --> 55:51.510
Ilulissat glacier and sit.

55:51.520 --> 55:55.100
And wait. We're going
to try to catch some...

55:55.110 --> 55:57.460
some big calving events.

55:57.470 --> 56:01.380
You know, kilometer wide pieces of ice coming

56:01.390 --> 56:05.430
of this massive, massive, glacier.

56:07.770 --> 56:09.220
The Ilulissat glacier in Greenland is kind

56:09.230 --> 56:10.970
of-- like the mother of all glaciers.

56:10.980 --> 56:13.050
It is the most productive glacier

56:13.060 --> 56:14.470
in the Norther Hemisphere.

56:14.480 --> 56:17.420
It's rumored that this is the
glacier that put out the iceberg

56:17.430 --> 56:18.340
that sank the titanic.

56:18.350 --> 56:22.510
It flows at 130 feet every day.

56:26.970 --> 56:32.930
This is a really, really huge fjord of ice,

56:32.940 --> 56:41.680
and it's about five miles wide.

56:43.020 --> 56:45.800
That is massive.

56:45.820 --> 56:48.130
I totally lost him.

56:48.140 --> 56:49.510
You see him still?

56:49.520 --> 56:50.800
He's going--
he's, he's about to turn on go

56:50.810 --> 56:52.640
in front of the peninsula
that we think's going to go.

56:52.650 --> 56:53.680
Oh, I see him.

56:53.730 --> 57:02.760
He's at the base of it.

57:04.230 --> 57:05.680
What's up?

57:05.690 --> 57:08.170
My boots are frozen.

57:08.230 --> 57:09.670
And I'm really tired.

57:09.680 --> 57:13.050
And nothing happens.

57:13.060 --> 57:17.420
For days and days and days.

57:17.430 --> 57:19.300
We called it glacier watching.

57:19.310 --> 57:20.720
Because literally, it was just,

57:20.730 --> 57:26.210
me and Adam, for three weeks, watching ice.

57:39.850 --> 57:41.680
Photography for me has been--

57:41.690 --> 57:45.560
as much as anything-- about
a raising of awareness.

57:45.570 --> 57:48.510
Through that camera, you
know, we become vehicles

57:48.520 --> 57:52.470
to raise awareness outside my own experience.

57:52.480 --> 57:58.840
And in this case, we're the messengers.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.340
He is a visionary,

58:12.350 --> 58:15.260
and his works are like sacred objects.

58:15.270 --> 58:16.670
I present James Balog.

58:16.720 --> 58:20.930
Thank you so much.

58:20.940 --> 58:23.100
Can we dim the house lights a little bit more?

58:23.110 --> 58:24.510
That's it, better.

58:24.520 --> 58:27.630
Okay. What I'm here
to do tonight is bring

58:27.640 --> 58:31.760
to you tangible, visual
evidence of the immediacy

58:31.770 --> 58:33.760
of climate change itself.

58:33.770 --> 58:36.760
Glaciers matter because they're the canary

58:36.780 --> 58:38.130
in the global coal mine.

58:38.140 --> 58:40.510
It's the place where you can
see climate change happening.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.340
And without further adieu,

58:42.400 --> 58:44.890
let me tell you what we've
been seeing out there.

58:44.900 --> 58:47.550
This is a glacier called the Solheim Glacier,

58:47.560 --> 58:48.590
we're looking down on it.

58:48.600 --> 58:52.470
Now we turn on our time lapse.

59:00.980 --> 59:02.510
You can see the terminus retreating,

59:02.560 --> 59:04.180
you can see this river being formed,

59:04.190 --> 59:08.220
you can see it deflating.

59:08.230 --> 59:10.760
You go back a couple years, in time...

59:10.770 --> 59:11.760
That's where it started.

59:11.770 --> 59:15.260
That's where it ended a few months ago.

59:15.270 --> 59:19.420
Now down onto the side of the glacier,

59:19.430 --> 59:24.930
looking across the terminus.

59:24.940 --> 59:25.670
This is what we see.

59:25.690 --> 59:26.670
Look at this.

59:26.680 --> 59:28.090
You'll see deflation happening here

59:28.100 --> 59:29.720
as heat takes away the surface

59:29.730 --> 59:31.550
of the glacier, the surface drops.

59:31.560 --> 59:34.350
At the same time, a stream is undercutting it

59:34.360 --> 59:36.840
from a glacier that's melting faster up valley,

59:36.850 --> 59:39.420
washing this thing away.

59:48.730 --> 59:52.840
The vast majority of glaciers
in the world are retreating.

59:52.850 --> 59:55.510
Glacier National Park
Montana will need a new name.

59:55.570 --> 59:58.510
We'll be calling it glacier-less
national park by the middle

59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.510
of the century because all
the glaciers will be gone.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.890
There's such a strange, bizarre fascination

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.340
in seeing these things you don't normally get

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:10.260
to see-- - come alive.

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:20.550
We're up at the Columbia glacier
in Alaska, this is a view

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.800
of what's called a calving face.

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.010
This is what one of our cameras saw

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:30.970
over a course of a few months.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.010
The action at Columbia is in part,

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.640
due to local glacier dynamics

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:39.970
and in part due to climate change.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.760
Here's another time-laps
shot of Columbia.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:45.310
And everybody says well don't
they advance in the wintertime?

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.090
No, it was retreating through the winter

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.470
because it's an unhealthy glacier.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.510
We realized it was retreating
so far we had to turn the camera

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.130
up stream to follow the retreat.

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:59.130
Then, we had to pivot it again.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.670
And then, when we went back
this past August, it was so far

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.340
out of frame we had to turn
the camera one more time

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:23.260
so that we could still see the glacier.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.180
So that's where we started three
years ago way out on the left,

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.510
that's where we were a few
months ago last time we were

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:38.300
into Columbia.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.590
We're going to have

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.380
to collapse it ---
put rocks over it.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.510
It's ripping too.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.720
We got to collapse it now.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:11.390
James Balog is documenting the melting

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.350
of glaciers around the world.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.420
The most visible manifestations
of climate change on the planet.

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:20.430
And he's making it possible
for scientists to watch too.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.800
James Balog is founder

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:24.260
and director of the Extreme
Ice Survey he's joining us now

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.170
from Denver, James, thanks for being with us.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.510
My pleasure, thank you.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.300
We'll also have
more on our special report

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.260
on a man who lets his pictures do the talking

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:34.390
As a photographer, it's exciting

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.880
to see this stuff, but as
a citizen of the world,

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.590
you go, this is horrible.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.180
And consider who NASA is sending

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:43.140
as a delegate to the climate
change summit in Copenhagen.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:47.010
Jim Balog, a photographer with
the group Extreme Ice Survey.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.170
Prior to '06--

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:51.180
This glacier had retreated 10, 11 miles.

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:54.470
And, now we've added just in the past few years,

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.170
another two and a half miles.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.260
One of
the things you often hear

01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.180
in the debate about glacier change is

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:01.840
that there are glaciers around the world

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:03.180
which are also getting bigger

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:05.390
and advancing, so, how can that be?

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.550
How can that be a response
to a global warming signal?

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.010
What we've done recently on the
Yukon territory in Canada ---

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:16.210
where we looked at the change in
glacier area from 1958 to 2008.

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:19.880
And what we found was, of the
1,400 glaciers that were there

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:23.010
in 1958, four got bigger.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:27.420
Over 300 disappeared completely, and almost all

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:30.090
of the rest got smaller.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.930
Yes, there is a component of natural variability

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.050
in the climate change we
observe, but, it's not enough

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.340
to explain the full signal.

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:42.140
So there has to be a
greenhouse gas element to it.

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:45.840
Up to the
Ilulissat Glacier calving face.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.300
A little helicopter is shown for scale.

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:51.300
The Atlantic Ocean is on
the left side of the frame,

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:53.010
covered with icebergs so thick,

01:03:53.020 --> 01:04:00.680
that you could walk across the ocean...

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:03.350
I'm on the phone with Jim,

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.800
on one of our regular check-ins,
Jim, just, nothing's happening.

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.010
Hey Jim!

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.340
Uh... it's going well.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.640
We had some serious bouts of wind.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:20.050
But other than that, things
are fairly well set up here.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.140
We've got some continuous time lapse going.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.970
It's starting Adam, I think.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.010
Adam it's starting.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:24.930
Oh wait, Jim, Jim...

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.340
The big piece is starting to calve.

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:28.840
Let me call you back.

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.590
Call him back.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.010
Okay.
Bye.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.510
Is it still going?

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:35.340
Yeah.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.510
In that V-section right there.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.640
Holy shit, look at that big berg rolling.

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:44.010
All four are running, right?

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.210
Yeah...
Look at that!

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.340
Do you see how...

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:52.390
look at the whole thing!

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:32.140
The calving face was 300
sometimes 400 feet tall.

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:33.220
Pieces of ice were shooting

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:37.010
out of the ocean 600 feet and then falling.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:46.130
The only way you can try to put it into scale

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:51.300
with human reference is
if you imagine Manhattan.

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:55.010
All the sudden, all those
buildings just start to rumble

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:58.010
and quake and peel off and just fall over,

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.220
fall over and roll around.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:05.170
This whole massive city, just breaking apart

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.800
in front of your eyes.

01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:17.550
We're just observers.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.630
These two little dots on
the side of the mountain

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.140
and we watched and recorded the largest,

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:27.840
witnessed calving event ever caught on tape.

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:33.350
So how big was this calving event

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.430
that we just looked at?

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.170
We'll resort to some illustrations again

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.510
to give you a sense of scale.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:45.340
It's as if the entire lower
tip of Manhattan broke off,

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.760
except that, the thickness--
the height of it-- is equivalent

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:51.340
to buildings that are two and a half

01:07:51.350 --> 01:08:00.380
or three times higher than they are.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:13.220
That's a magical, miraculous,
horrible, scary thing.

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:16.800
I don't know that anybody's
really seen the miracle

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:21.640
and horror of that.

01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:23.300
It took a hundred years for it

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:26.960
to retreat eight miles
- from 1900 to 2000.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:30.800
From 2000 to 2010, it retreated nine miles.

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:33.180
So in 10 years, it retreated more

01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:37.800
than it had in the previous 100.

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:39.010
It's real.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.470
The changes are happening;
they're very visible,

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:44.060
they're photographable, they're measurable.

01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:47.670
There's no significant
scientific dispute about that.

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:50.510
And the great irony and tragedy
of our time is that a lot

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.840
of the general public thinks

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:54.390
that science is still arguing about that.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:56.170
Science is not arguing about that.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.340
One of
the really troubling things

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:01.890
about climate change is that almost all

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:05.500
of the world's prestigious
climatologist are much more

01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:08.090
frightened about all this than the public is.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.260
People have
a hard time understanding

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:13.760
when we talk about climate change.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:17.010
What for me is so powerful
and actually unprecedented

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.800
in the work that he is doing,
is visualizing the change

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:27.010
that allows us to actually see
what was and what is become.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.800
I actually saw his work last spring

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:33.680
and that kind of changed my
life in the sense that I had

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:36.840
to quit what I was doing,
which was working for Shell,

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:42.890
and get involved in this debate
in a much more profound way.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:44.390
The Extreme Ice Survey will go

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:47.880
down in history as this is the evidence

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:51.840
that we knew what was going on.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.430
You can't deny it!

01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:01.800
We don't have a problem with economics,

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:03.930
technology and public policy.

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.760
We have a problem with perception.

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:08.880
Because not enough people really get it yet.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:11.340
I believe we really have
an opportunity right now.

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:14.010
We are nearly on the edge of a crisis,

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:18.340
but we still have an opportunity
to face the greatest challenge

01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:21.050
of our generation, and in fact, of our century.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.550
Thank you.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:53.010
When my daughters, Simone and
Emily, look at me 25 or 30 years

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:57.920
from now and say, what were
you doing when, when...

01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:59.510
global warming was happening

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.390
and you guys knew what was coming down the road.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.100
I want to be able to say, guys,

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.170
I was doing everything I knew how to do.
