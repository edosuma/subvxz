love a dress for Christmas!

19:41.814 --> 19:43.881
Well, isn't that nice?

19:43.883 --> 19:46.284
Here.
Eat your dinner.

Hey, we don't talk like that
in this house.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.250
You understand me?

20:19.252 --> 20:22.253
I don't want to ever hear you
speak like that again.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.354
You got a mama.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.559
Go. Go to bed.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.296

You are a very,

CONSTANCE: What killed
that little girl?

24:05.144 --> 24:06.544
She died of diphtheria.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.645
Diphtheria?

24:07.647 --> 24:08.879
Yes, it's a bacterial infection

24:08.881 --> 24:11.449
that attacks
the respiratory system.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.217
And it shuts down the airways

24:13.218 --> 24:14.984
and the patient ultimately
dies from suffocation.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.854
Are you sure it's diphtheria?

24:16.856 --> 24:19.023
Yes, I'm sure.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.724
But don't we have
the antitoxin?

24:20.726 --> 24:23.627
Yes, we do.
But it's expired.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.962
What are we going to do?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.864
Well, I'm going
to bring all the children

24:26.866 --> 24:28.866
showing symptoms
up to the hospital immediately

24:28.868 --> 24:31.802
and we'll-- I'll check
on all of Mary's classmates.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.777
George, we have a problem.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.546
An Inuit girl
died of diphtheria,

24:42.548 --> 24:44.982
and I assume that there are
many more infected

24:44.984 --> 24:46.584
out in the sandspit.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.751
Diphtheria?

24:47.753 --> 24:49.520
Yes.
It's highly infectious

24:49.522 --> 24:51.722
and I have no antitoxin
to fight it with.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.923
I ordered more,
but it didn't arrive

24:52.925 --> 24:54.658
with the last shipment.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.560
There isn't
another way to cure it?

24:56.562 --> 24:57.962
No. And you and I know
what can happen

24:57.964 --> 25:00.531
with the last flu epidemic.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.032
This could be very,
very bad.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.835
It could be much worse
if we don't get it here quickly.

25:04.837 --> 25:08.706
Curtis, you just tell me
what you want me to do.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.542

25:22.622 --> 25:24.688
WETZLER: Governor?
- Hmm.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.657
Sir, it's a telegram
from the Mayor of Nome,

25:26.659 --> 25:28.659
- very urgent.
- From who?

25:28.661 --> 25:30.194
WETZLER: From Nome, Sir,
very urgent.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.795
The mayor in Nome.

25:31.797 --> 25:32.963
Read it to me.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.767
"An outbreak of diphtheria
is almost inevitable here."

25:36.769 --> 25:38.135
Stop.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.771
"I am in urgent need
of diphtheria antitoxin."

25:40.773 --> 25:42.606
Stop.

25:42.608 --> 25:46.677
God, Nome.
I almost forgot about Nome.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.079
We haven't heard
from them in years.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.581
What would you like to do,
Sir?

25:53.052 --> 25:55.920
Ah, call every hospital
down the coast

25:55.922 --> 25:58.923
from Seattle to San Francisco
and tell them to send

25:58.925 --> 26:01.725
as much antitoxin
as they can spare.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.193
Okay, but... but Sir,

26:03.195 --> 26:05.045
how are we supposed
to transport it there?

26:05.046 --> 26:06.896
We can't get it there by ship.
The seaport's frozen over.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.966
And... and Nenana's
the last stop on the railroad,

26:08.968 --> 26:10.167
that's at least 700 miles
from Nome?

26:10.169 --> 26:12.736
Look,
just get the antitoxin.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.940
Yes, Sir.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.295
MAYOR MAYNARD: Thank you
all for coming out.

26:21.296 --> 26:23.580
Dr. Welch has some important
news that affects all of us.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.615
Doctor?

26:27.353 --> 26:29.787
A young girl
has died of diphtheria.

26:29.789 --> 26:33.090
It's a very dangerous
and contagious disease

26:33.092 --> 26:36.794
and it's going to spread
very rapidly through town.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.765
If any of your young ones
have a sore throat

26:41.767 --> 26:45.035
or a high fever,
any cold symptoms at all,

26:45.037 --> 26:48.906
please send them
to the hospital immediately.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.308
Is it just the young ones
or can the adults get it too?

26:51.310 --> 26:53.010
Children are
at the highest risk

26:53.012 --> 26:55.746
because their immune systems
aren't as developed as ours.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.816
But adults can carry
the disease without knowing it.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.218
So I want you all
to stay in your homes.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.152
ELLIOT:
What are we supposed to do?

27:02.154 --> 27:03.387
How do we treat this?

27:03.389 --> 27:05.289
Well, there--
there is an antitoxin

27:05.291 --> 27:08.292
but I'm sorry, at the moment,
we-- we don't have it.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.861
[all speaking simultaneously]

27:10.863 --> 27:13.931
Folks, folks,
please, please quiet down.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.265
We-- we we've contacted
the governor.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.634
How do we have not any of it?

27:16.636 --> 27:17.635
And he--
and he's going to send us

27:17.637 --> 27:20.104
the antitoxin
as soon as possible.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.940
I-- I assure you we're doing
the best we can right now,

27:22.942 --> 27:25.242
so just please do
what the doctor says.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.778
I think everybody
just has to stay calm.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.996
Stay in their homes.

27:28.997 --> 27:30.213
We're going to do
everything we can to--

27:30.216 --> 27:31.682
to get this antitoxin here.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.784
That's what
we're trying to figure out.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.885
<i> So stay in your homes,</i>
<i> because it will not spread</i>

27:35.888 --> 27:37.154
<i> if you stay in your homes.</i>

27:37.156 --> 27:38.355
<i> That's what I ask of you.</i>

27:38.357 --> 27:39.323
<i> We will get it here.</i>

27:46.432 --> 27:49.833
Well, we should have
enough antitoxin

27:49.835 --> 27:52.102
by the end of the week.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.872
The last thing
we need is bad press,

27:54.874 --> 27:57.241
so I'm hoping
you will support our effort.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.344
Well, I was hoping

28:00.346 --> 28:01.812
you would finally
see the light of day

28:01.814 --> 28:03.347
and realize
it was time for Alaska

28:03.349 --> 28:04.915
to step into the modern age.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.017
What do you mean by that?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.254
I'm talking about an airplane.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.006
[Governor Bone chuckles]

28:12.007 --> 28:13.757
We can have that serum
in Nome in two days.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.159
Does this have anything to do
with the fact

28:15.161 --> 28:18.462
that you are a part owner
of an airline by any chance?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.964
I don't see that
that is really relevant

28:20.966 --> 28:22.066
to any matters at hand.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.300
You have a problem.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.202
I'm offering you
a solution.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.272
Subzero temperatures
and Arctic winds

28:28.274 --> 28:31.308
are not very conducive
to your flying machines.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.243
William,
this is Alaska.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.411
This is our chance,
Governor.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.914
Yeah.
Well you don't have a plane,

28:36.916 --> 28:39.049
and you don't have a pilot.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.419
Now, to fly that distance
in winter conditions,

28:42.421 --> 28:43.987
I already checked.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.789
I know.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.125
You called Washington
and they ignored you again.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.893
No, they didn't ignore me.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.995
[chuckles] Ignore me.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.866
I can have a plane and a pilot
ready by tomorrow.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.736
Listen, the plane goes down
with the serum on board,

28:58.738 --> 29:00.370
we will be unable
to help anyone.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.972
My plane will make it.

29:01.974 --> 29:06.343
And I guarantee you will be
front page news on my paper.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.046
Aren't you tired of playing
second fiddle to the lower 48?

29:09.048 --> 29:13.183
Oh, Jesus. What the hell does
that have to do with anything?

29:13.185 --> 29:14.451

I'll make you a hero.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.888
Hell this could even mean
a second term.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.123
Put you on the map
so to speak.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.830
I'll take your silence
as a yes.

29:26.832 --> 29:29.099
I want a test flight first.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.769
If you can prove to me
you can get a plane up there

29:31.771 --> 29:32.803
and fly that distance,

29:32.805 --> 29:36.807
I will consider
flying up the serum.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.142
You're a wise man,
Governor.

29:42.515 --> 29:45.282
Got a wire
from the Governor's office.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.384
They found the antiserum
in Anchorage.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.987
They want to fly it in
by airplane.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.256
We could possibly have it
in a couple of days.

30:54.153 --> 30:58.088
Daddy,
what's going to happen to us?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.057
Well, then, let's go
get that medicine.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.925
Nothing's going to happen to us.

31:05.497 --> 31:11.301
Gentlemen, it is time for us
to stop talking and take action.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.570
We need to go
get that serum ourselves.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.372
How will you
get the medicine here?

31:15.374 --> 31:17.140
The sea is frozen over.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.076
A ship couldn't get
within a hundred miles.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.210
We'll mush it in.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.579
Dog sled?
You can't be serious.

31:22.581 --> 31:23.947
Hi, get out of the cold.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.084
My father and George
are meeting

31:27.086 --> 31:28.952
with the town council
at the saloon.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.221
They're discussing the plans
to get the serum here.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.223
George asked me urgently
to get you there.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.226
I'm dead serious,
Mr. Wells.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.662
I'd much rather
put our hopes in a man

31:38.664 --> 31:41.665
and a-a good team of dogs
than some damn flying machine

31:41.667 --> 31:44.167
that can't even
get off the ground.

31:44.169 --> 31:47.037
It's possible.
The railroad's still running.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.438
We take the mail route

31:48.440 --> 31:50.641
and-and the trains get it
as far as Nenana.

31:50.643 --> 31:52.276
MAN: One musher can never
make it there and back.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.044
It's 700 miles.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.412
MAYOR MAYNARD:
Not one musher.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.180
A relay.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.616
We station men
at every roadhouse

31:59.618 --> 32:01.618
along the way
from here to Nenana.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.353
DR. WELCH:
George is right.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.189
It may put lives at risk,

32:05.190 --> 32:07.024
but at this point
it's the best option we have.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.625
We know these men.

32:08.627 --> 32:11.695
We know
what they're capable of.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.430
Can you keep Sigrid?

32:13.432 --> 32:14.431
CONSTANCE:
Of course.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.365
Okay, I'll be back.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.303
Look, I have three children.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.705
And I just don't know if
this is the best option for us.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.141
What if we wait another week
and this weather passes?

32:24.143 --> 32:25.676
Yes.

32:25.678 --> 32:27.561
Then we can get an airplane
up here in better weather.

32:27.562 --> 32:29.445
You've got a
nine-month-old, Elliot.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.714
Do you really want
to take that chance?

32:30.716 --> 32:32.215
We are out of time.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.583
What if they can't make it
through the mountains

32:33.585 --> 32:35.118
by dog sled?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.586
And the serum gets lost.
Then what?

32:36.588 --> 32:38.055
We have to try.

32:38.057 --> 32:41.124
Every day we wait,
children are going to die.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.093
I'm not going to
let that happen.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.294
I vote in favor.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.097
Any more discussion?

32:48.100 --> 32:49.733
Good.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.201
Let's get started.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.669
"Today officials
tried a second attempt

32:52.671 --> 32:55.272
"at delivering the serum

"But the plane

at the halfway point,

33:15.728 --> 33:17.394
I'll do it.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.596
Sepp, even you've said

33:19.598 --> 33:21.999
that the Norton Sound
and the mountain pass

33:22.001 --> 33:24.768
never be taken
when the weather's not right.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.270
How you're going to do this
in a storm?

33:27.272 --> 33:30.040
I can't lose Sigrid.

33:30.042 --> 33:33.477
The Norton Sound
has killed many men,

33:33.479 --> 33:36.513
but we need that serum
and we need it now.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.382
DR. WELCH:
They're expecting temperatures

33:38.383 --> 33:40.250
to drop to below 40
tomorrow night

33:40.252 --> 33:42.686
and there's a blizzard
dropping in from the north.

<i> and hurricane strength winds."</i>

33:50.229 --> 33:52.129
Can the serum survive
those conditions?

33:52.131 --> 33:53.597
It can't stay frozen
for too long

33:53.599 --> 33:55.632
or the antitoxin
will be destroyed,

33:55.634 --> 34:00.137
but if it were thawed
at each waypoint

34:00.139 --> 34:04.041
and packed very carefully,
yes, I think it would.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.214
SEPP: I'm going to need somebody
to stay with Sigrid.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.722
I'll stay with her
till this is over.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.292
Thanks, George.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.594
I'll have Togo ready.

34:27.266 --> 34:30.300
Gunner, use my dogs
and prepare a second team.

In case the storm
takes a turn for the worse,

Balto's ready
to lead a team.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.474
I'll be ready.

35:05.170 --> 35:11.374
I met with George,
your father, and Gunnar.

35:11.376 --> 35:14.311

with a plan.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.393
You can do this?

35:32.464 --> 35:33.497
Yes.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.399
We're going to get that

I will treat her like my own

<i> The entire world now breathes</i>

01:17:41.424 --> 01:17:44.191
a collective sigh of relief.

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:46.427
I think this editorial
from the Daily News-Miner

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:48.729
sums it up best.

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:51.032
<i> We thank those brave men</i>
<i> and their valiant dogs</i>

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:53.401
<i> for saving so many lives.</i>

01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:55.436
<i> But we owe them</i>
<i> a bigger debt of gratitude</i>

01:17:55.438 --> 01:17:58.139
<i> for showing us</i>
<i> that anything is possible</i>

01:17:58.141 --> 01:18:02.009
<i> when you have</i>
<i> hope and courage.</i>

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.678

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.903

<i> INUIT SHAMAN:</i>
<i> There was a higher Spirit</i>

01:19:07.477 --> 01:19:09.443
<i> that guided</i>
<i> those men and dogs</i>

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:12.313
<i> across the harsh conditions</i>
<i> of our land.</i>

01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:24.492
<i> Seppala would never</i>

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:30.531
<i> His love for his dogs</i>

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.034
<i> And the wild spirit</i>

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:37.171
