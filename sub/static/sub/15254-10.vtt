The Intersect made

00:06.323 --> 00:07.756

00:18.483 --> 00:20.383
where we want to be
raising our kids?

00:20.417 --> 00:22.750
This is what I think
our coworkers are really up to.

We should make more time for us.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.593
Anyway,

00:56.627 --> 00:58.193
I still don't get it--
I don't see how this

00:58.228 --> 00:59.260
is going to make them forget

00:59.295 --> 01:00.627

Okay.

Okay, let's, uh...
let's talk about that.

02:28.933 --> 02:30.900
Look, I-I...
I've been up all night,

02:30.935 --> 02:33.602
and I... I've been thinking
about our futures

02:33.636 --> 02:36.137
and, you know, maybe babies.

02:36.171 --> 02:38.238
- Oof. Yeah.
- And I want all of that,

02:38.272 --> 02:41.340
but the more I think about it,
I just don't know if that future

02:41.374 --> 02:43.274
goes with the life
that we're living right now.

02:43.308 --> 02:45.642

Every day, we make
a new dangerous enemy.

02:47.677 --> 02:49.811

to the front door with a gun

02:49.845 --> 02:51.178
because I heard the newspaper
being delivered.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.813
Yeah, parents can't be
shooting the paperboy.

Look, I'm a spy, and that's all
I ever thought that I could be,

that we don't have

03:00.051 --> 03:01.584
to give up what
we've already built.

03:01.618 --> 03:04.786
We can just shift
what Carmichael Industries does.

03:04.820 --> 03:08.022
Okay, shift it to what?

03:08.056 --> 03:10.456
Countering cyberterrorism.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.424
It's your
tech firm idea,

03:12.459 --> 03:15.059
but more spied up-- so we keep
your computer know-how

03:15.093 --> 03:18.961
and mix it with my experience
in international bad guy-ery.

03:18.995 --> 03:21.095

03:21.130 --> 03:23.330
who use keyboards
instead of bullets.

03:23.365 --> 03:24.998
Which means we don't
have to use bullets, either.

03:26.567 --> 03:29.568
I mean, the timing of it
does kind of feel right.

03:29.603 --> 03:30.869
We've got nothing left hanging.

03:30.904 --> 03:32.004
No new missions.

03:32.038 --> 03:33.672
No wrongs to right.

03:35.374 --> 03:36.840

03:38.744 --> 03:41.979

the idea to Casey?

03:45.016 --> 03:46.617

I feel about bullets,

03:46.651 --> 03:47.851

negatively, okay?

stolen systems

03:57.025 --> 03:58.259

I have been partying

my freaking face off,

05:53.861 --> 05:55.127

at lost memories?

10:16.548 --> 10:18.215
And we're going to do that
by sticking

10:18.250 --> 10:20.184
to those fools like the
stink on my breath.

10:20.218 --> 10:22.386
Now, to the Buy More.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.754
Careful.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.220
Careful.

10:37.932 --> 10:39.499
Light
traffic day.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.400
Yeah.

10:41.435 --> 10:44.169
I think Morgan might really
be hypnotized in there.

10:44.203 --> 10:45.936
Great. Hey, hey, look,
I've been looking

10:45.971 --> 10:47.871
at, uh, some new
possible office spaces.

10:47.906 --> 10:49.606
Above ground.
We could have windows.

10:50.808 --> 10:52.341
If we ever get there.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.709
What do you mean?

10:53.743 --> 10:56.011
It just seems
like no matter what,

10:56.046 --> 10:57.279
the Intersect keeps finding me.

10:57.313 --> 10:59.949
I keep trying
to break free,

10:59.983 --> 11:02.718
and the very thing that started
this keeps hooking us back in.

11:02.753 --> 11:04.219
Chuck, we're going
to finish this.

11:04.253 --> 11:05.787
And we're going to move on,
I promise you.

11:07.088 --> 11:08.856
Hey, Casey,
you want to see

11:08.890 --> 11:10.758
your new office space?

11:10.792 --> 11:12.525
No, 'cause we ain't out yet.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.259
Even if it belonged
to a little someone

11:14.294 --> 11:18.229
named Ronald Wilson Reagan?

11:18.263 --> 11:19.196
Seriously?

11:19.230 --> 11:20.397
The Gipper?

11:22.500 --> 11:24.900
Hey, guys, I got something.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.135
Morgan keeps repeating the
phrases "emerald and gold"

11:27.170 --> 11:28.203
and the number "ten."

11:28.238 --> 11:30.305
"Emerald and gold,"
what does that mean?

11:30.339 --> 11:32.273
I don't know.
I tried to push him

11:32.307 --> 11:35.142
a little further, but I think
I got a little too aggressive.

11:35.176 --> 11:37.410
You are so hot.

11:37.445 --> 11:38.712
You're so hot.

11:38.746 --> 11:40.346
And if you went to prom with me,

11:40.380 --> 11:42.214
I would be the stokedest guy
in high school.

11:42.248 --> 11:44.249
I think I took
him back too far.

11:44.283 --> 11:45.983
It's possible.

11:46.017 --> 11:48.185
Okay, Morgan,
let's undo this.

11:48.219 --> 11:50.154
Look at the pen.

11:50.188 --> 11:53.790
I don't know how to look
at anything but you.

11:53.824 --> 11:55.358
You're so beautiful.

11:59.329 --> 12:02.965
Wow. Hey, I didn't say anything
stupid while I was under, did I?

12:02.999 --> 12:05.100
No. No-no-no.

12:05.102 --> 12:06.768
You get a return text yet?

12:06.803 --> 12:09.171
No. No-no-no.

12:09.205 --> 12:11.540
Uh, are you
the manager?

12:11.574 --> 12:14.009
I want to return this blender.
Yeah, sure,

12:14.043 --> 12:15.744
I'll take care of that for you.

12:15.779 --> 12:17.680
Do you have a receipt?
Let me check.

12:17.714 --> 12:19.415
Are you in a serious
relationship?

12:20.551 --> 12:22.752
Excuse me?

12:22.786 --> 12:24.657
I just want to know
if you're in a serious

12:24.682 --> 12:25.882
relationship right now.

12:26.723 --> 12:29.826
I'll call you back.

12:29.860 --> 12:32.128
Uh, I actually am, yeah.
Anyway, back to the blender...

12:32.162 --> 12:32.961
Do you love her?

12:32.986 --> 12:35.771
That's a really personal
question for a blender return.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.032
Dale, I told you

12:37.067 --> 12:38.367
to stop bothering me.

12:38.402 --> 12:41.370
Morgan, I am so, so sorry.

12:43.707 --> 12:45.340
Yeah, no, sure.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.641
Um, who's Dale?

12:46.676 --> 12:49.544
He's just a guy I went out with

12:49.578 --> 12:51.646
a few times when we broke up.
He's nobody.

12:51.681 --> 12:54.082
- Really.
- Nobody?

12:54.117 --> 12:56.618
Oh, so I guess
it was nobody that--

12:56.652 --> 12:59.755
wait, how did you put it?
Filled your body with rainbows?

12:59.789 --> 13:01.623
Oh...

13:01.657 --> 13:04.392
Please tell me he's talking about
finger painting, all right?

13:04.427 --> 13:06.094
Because I don't even understand
how that even works.

13:06.128 --> 13:07.362
Morgan, please, there's
nothing between us, okay?

13:07.396 --> 13:08.497
I was just hurt,

13:08.531 --> 13:10.132
and I was missing you,

13:10.166 --> 13:12.801
and so I acted out a little
physically.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.503
You acted out physically?

13:15.538 --> 13:17.138
Oh, I think I'm
going to be sick.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.274
There were rainbows.

13:21.077 --> 13:23.411
I love him, Dale.
So just stop coming here.

13:23.446 --> 13:25.013
I...
I got my text.

13:27.383 --> 13:28.717
Thank God.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.754
Let's talk later,
you and I, okay?

13:32.789 --> 13:35.257
There he is.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.758
Dale.
Hey, John.

13:37.793 --> 13:38.893
What?

13:38.928 --> 13:40.729
You're the one that pulled
the text message breakup.

13:42.765 --> 13:44.533
Alex, always great to see you.

13:44.567 --> 13:47.636
Dale, store credit only.

13:47.671 --> 13:48.838
Oh.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.809
We never hugged.
Are you kidding me?

13:51.843 --> 13:52.876
Sorry.

13:52.911 --> 13:56.711
Where are they?
We lost them, we lost them!

13:56.745 --> 13:58.412
She acted out physically?!

13:58.446 --> 14:00.180
Morgan, I know
this is hard,

14:00.214 --> 14:02.115
but you did dump
her via text.

14:02.150 --> 14:03.550
I know, the whole
text thing.

14:03.584 --> 14:05.518
I know I shouldn't be mad,
but I am.

14:05.552 --> 14:06.886
You want to know why?

14:06.920 --> 14:09.021
Because I was true blue, baby,
that's right.

14:09.055 --> 14:10.623
While she was out
there gallivanting

14:10.657 --> 14:12.289
all over town, spreading her
filthy rainbows to every

14:12.314 --> 14:13.514
Tom, Dick and Harry,

14:13.559 --> 14:14.893
I stayed strong, dude.
I did.

14:14.927 --> 14:16.961
You know what, I need to know
every detail.

14:16.996 --> 14:18.630
Every little morsel
I got to find out.

14:18.664 --> 14:19.931
Buddy, buddy,
I know you're upset,

14:19.965 --> 14:24.271
but I don't think knowing
all the gory rainbowed details

14:24.305 --> 14:26.974
is going to make you feel
any better about it.

14:27.008 --> 14:28.142
Right, boss.

14:28.176 --> 14:29.877
Guys, look.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.313
There's a Golden Peak Resort
in Vail, Colorado, and...

14:33.348 --> 14:36.917
Look, here. It's a
Michael Carmichael registered

14:36.952 --> 14:38.652
the night in question.

14:38.686 --> 14:40.754
Hey, looks like
that's our ski town.

14:40.788 --> 14:42.489
All right, kids,
let's pack up.

14:42.523 --> 14:45.659
Morgan, sadly you're going
to need to look the way

14:45.693 --> 14:48.061
you did that weekend,
so do you still have

14:48.095 --> 14:51.531
any more of that hair bleach
and your Affliction T-shirt?

14:51.565 --> 14:53.566
Who would know?

14:53.601 --> 14:56.069
Why...? Yes.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.904
Great, let's go.

15:03.043 --> 15:07.346
♪

15:10.050 --> 15:13.219
Looks like all of Vail is here.

15:13.253 --> 15:15.120
Hope BD is, too.

15:15.155 --> 15:17.656
Any of this triggering
a memory, Grimes?

15:17.691 --> 15:19.692
Nope, nothing yet.

15:22.562 --> 15:24.830
You two better love each other.

15:24.865 --> 15:26.298
It's sickening

15:26.333 --> 15:28.334
the amount of meaningless
physical encounters

15:28.368 --> 15:29.836
that happen nowadays.

15:29.870 --> 15:31.271
Morgan?

15:38.909 --> 15:40.142
Bo Derek!

15:40.177 --> 15:41.510
BD?

15:41.545 --> 15:43.912
BD is Bo Derek?

15:43.947 --> 15:45.114
Wow.

15:45.148 --> 15:47.682
Thought I'd never
see you again, lover.

16:01.412 --> 16:02.745
Hello, Bo Derek's tongue.

16:02.780 --> 16:03.980
Wow.
Wow.

16:04.014 --> 16:06.392
Wow.
Morgan, you need to stay with it.

16:06.393 --> 16:08.828
We need to find out everything
she knows, okay?

16:08.862 --> 16:11.363
I thought for sure I'd hear
from you sooner. Bad boy.

16:11.398 --> 16:12.832
You're the guy who made out

16:12.866 --> 16:14.833
with Bo Derek, so act like it.

16:14.868 --> 16:17.502
Yeah, I know. That's
just bad boy stuff.

16:17.536 --> 16:18.636
That's just
how I roll.

16:18.671 --> 16:21.406
Hi, Bo Derek.
I'm Chuck.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.640
My name is Chuck.

16:22.674 --> 16:24.141
Really big, big fan.

16:24.175 --> 16:27.345
Just loved just so, so much.
We really do.

16:27.346 --> 16:29.118
Yeah, I know what you
did with that poster.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.102
Oh, no, no, no. I-- I wouldn't...
Ew.

16:32.136 --> 16:33.736
Not that I didn't love
the poster as a boy.

16:33.770 --> 16:36.404
How do you know my friend here?
I don't like to kiss and tell,

16:36.439 --> 16:39.574
but your friend rocked my world
one magical night in November.

16:39.608 --> 16:40.675
Seriously?
Seriously?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.743
Seriously?
Seriously?

16:42.778 --> 16:45.245
No, I'll never forget
that... that evening.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.845
But, um,

16:46.880 --> 16:48.545
How did I got about
that-- the rocking?

16:48.580 --> 16:50.813
Words would ruin it,

16:50.847 --> 16:54.082
but, uh, there were definitely
rainbows involved.

16:54.116 --> 16:57.020
There's that... Check that
out, there were rainbows.

16:58.322 --> 17:01.024
I guess Alex wasn't the only one
with secrets, huh?

17:01.058 --> 17:03.727
Bo, what exactly
happened that evening?

17:03.761 --> 17:05.795
Because I'm a little fuzzy,
you know, with all the

17:05.829 --> 17:08.432
gluggity, gluggity, gluggity.
You were a bit out of hand.

17:08.465 --> 17:09.967
Come on, I'll show you.

17:10.001 --> 17:11.535
I'm always out of hand.

17:16.973 --> 17:18.836
Oh, seems like a lot

17:18.861 --> 17:20.060
of people might know what
you did that night.

17:20.109 --> 17:21.843
He was telling everyone

17:21.877 --> 17:24.846
who would listen, how he'd
saved the world that day.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.647
You're such a funny bunny.

17:26.682 --> 17:28.183
I am.

17:28.217 --> 17:29.384
What else
did I mention?

17:29.418 --> 17:30.885
You know, because
I lost something

17:30.919 --> 17:32.620
and I'm trying to retrace
my steps.

17:32.654 --> 17:34.255
Yeah, what did Funny Bunny do

17:34.289 --> 17:36.824
when he left the bar?
He came to my room.

17:36.858 --> 17:40.060
Morgan, maybe the vault
that the glasses are in

17:40.095 --> 17:41.662
is a safe in Bo Derek's room.

17:41.696 --> 17:43.196
You need to get up there now.

17:43.231 --> 17:45.398
I have a girlfriend.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.467
Yeah? Well, you should
have remembered that two months ago.

17:47.501 --> 17:48.801
Now get to work.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.103
They're looking for a vault.
Write that down.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.838
We are not forgetting
anything this time.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.907
Man, this brings
back some memories.

17:55.941 --> 17:59.043
Speaking of which, you're
not still staying in that room are you?

17:59.077 --> 18:02.648
Because if you are-- oh, boy,
ding, ding, ding, round two.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.116
Come on.
Yeah.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.385
Oh, have fun, tiger.
You know I will.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.386
Mmm.

18:07.421 --> 18:08.888
You remember this?

18:08.923 --> 18:12.257
Yes, yes, I do.
Who could forget this?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.958
Hey, now.

18:13.992 --> 18:17.059
Okay. Incidentally,
Bo Derek,

18:17.094 --> 18:18.527
is this where
the rainbows happened?

18:18.562 --> 18:19.728
I'm curious only because

18:19.763 --> 18:21.563
they've been coming
up a lot lately,

18:21.598 --> 18:23.064
and I would love
to know specifically

18:23.099 --> 18:24.899
what makes them happen?
What is the trigger, you know.

18:24.933 --> 18:27.102
I'll show you.

18:27.136 --> 18:28.302
Yeah, cool. Can't wait.

18:28.335 --> 18:30.068
Taking off my pants
now, Chuck.

18:30.103 --> 18:31.669
Oh, dude,

18:31.703 --> 18:34.438
Bo Derek is
taking your pants off.

18:34.472 --> 18:36.573
Just go with it, okay?
Ask her to tell you

18:36.607 --> 18:38.308
more about that night.

18:38.342 --> 18:39.576
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:39.610 --> 18:44.214
Hey, so, um, you know what
I would lov-love, love?!

18:44.248 --> 18:46.482
Totally love,
Bo Derek, is, um...

18:46.517 --> 18:48.718
Tell me the story
about our night together.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.754
Oh, okay.
Mm-hmm.

18:50.789 --> 18:52.591
But only if you tell me exactly

18:52.625 --> 18:55.627
what you've done
since I was with you last.

18:55.662 --> 18:58.130
Deal, lover.
So I first noticed you

18:58.164 --> 19:00.031
when you were getting
a lap dance

19:00.066 --> 19:02.234
from that dirty whore
Jaclyn Smith.

19:03.336 --> 19:05.871
And that was when he got
the whole bar singing

19:05.905 --> 19:07.969
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,"
unironically.

19:08.003 --> 19:11.068
Right, so he didn't tell you
anything else about his night?

19:11.102 --> 19:12.303
He got me
pretty wasted.

19:12.337 --> 19:14.237
I woke up the next morning
behind the bar

19:14.272 --> 19:15.571
in a puddle of Rumplemintz.

19:15.606 --> 19:18.141
And then we played
the funniest game,

19:18.175 --> 19:22.677
where you hid and I found you,
and then I hid and you found me.

19:22.712 --> 19:25.280
Oh, man, so fun.

19:25.314 --> 19:28.715
Well, all I've been able to dig up is
what we already know.

19:28.749 --> 19:30.085
Grimes was an ass.

19:30.110 --> 19:31.510
Yeah, I'm getting
the same thing.

19:31.519 --> 19:33.554
Hey, Chuck, how's
it going with Bo?

19:33.588 --> 19:36.158
Have you had any sneak peeks of
your childhood crush's boobies?

19:36.193 --> 19:38.127
What? No.

19:38.161 --> 19:39.461
Shut up.

19:41.664 --> 19:44.299
We have a situation.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.500
Oh, you are kidding me.

19:47.535 --> 19:48.934
How did they
track us here?

19:48.969 --> 19:51.001
This is what you get
when you fly commercial.

19:51.035 --> 19:53.036
I'll take care of it.
Copy.

19:55.005 --> 19:56.973
Hey, were you just asking
about Morgan Grimes?

19:57.007 --> 19:59.774
Uh, yes.
Ha, ha, ha. That dude's hilarious.

19:59.808 --> 20:01.974
I gave him the most
wacked tattoo ever.

20:02.008 --> 20:03.574
You gave him a tattoo?

20:05.676 --> 20:07.610
Tattoo.

20:07.644 --> 20:09.478
Morgan, I need you out here
ASAP.

20:09.512 --> 20:10.846
Be careful.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.347
You know what
I'm going to do?

20:12.382 --> 20:14.516
I'm going to get us
a little fresh ice.

20:14.550 --> 20:15.718
What do you think about that?
Okay.

20:15.752 --> 20:16.685
Yeah.
Hurry back.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.719
No problem, okay.

20:17.754 --> 20:22.023
And bring back a couple
extra cubes for play time.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.093
You two.

20:26.128 --> 20:28.228
Do whatever you want.
We know what's going on here.

20:28.263 --> 20:30.430
We're not, we're not
going to forget.

20:30.464 --> 20:33.165
I disagree.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.034
What is that?
That smells nice.

20:38.069 --> 20:40.002
Doesn't it?

20:40.036 --> 20:41.768
That woman is into me.

20:41.803 --> 20:43.570
And I'm really scared
that whatever is going

20:43.604 --> 20:45.538
to take place in there
is going to be way worse

20:45.573 --> 20:46.507
than whatever
acting out Alex did.

20:46.541 --> 20:47.675
Plus we were broken up,
so technically...

20:47.709 --> 20:49.444
Buddy, buddy, you
have a tattoo.

20:49.478 --> 20:51.212
No, I do not.

20:51.246 --> 20:52.447
What? Aw!

20:52.482 --> 20:54.649
What are you...?

20:54.684 --> 20:55.617
Don't trust Bo Derek.

20:55.651 --> 20:57.018
That's what
your tattoo says.

20:57.052 --> 20:59.386
Come on, she must be involved
with the Intersect theft.

21:02.290 --> 21:06.558
Not the strangest place a man
has tattooed my name.

21:06.593 --> 21:08.726
Now take me to the glasses.

21:10.596 --> 21:12.230
I'm just going
to go out and say it--

21:12.264 --> 21:14.365
you're no longer a perfect 10.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.733
I know you remember something.

21:15.768 --> 21:17.034
My backup is on the way

21:17.069 --> 21:19.869
And you do not want
to know what they will do...

21:21.773 --> 21:24.041
Sorry, I had to do that
to your girlfriend.

21:24.075 --> 21:27.343
Oh... You didn't hit her
in the face, did you?

21:28.144 --> 21:30.546
I'm kidding.
But it is Bo Derek.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.014
Okay.

21:45.058 --> 21:49.260
Ow. Sweet mother of
all that is holy.

21:50.962 --> 21:52.963
Ow.

21:52.998 --> 21:54.499
Ow!

21:54.533 --> 21:57.802
Dude, what happened?
Where are we?

21:57.836 --> 22:01.037
I don't...
I don't know.

22:01.072 --> 22:02.438
You're wearing a Vegas hat.

22:02.473 --> 22:03.707
We must've gone to Vegas.

22:03.741 --> 22:06.610
Yeah, stole a car.

22:06.645 --> 22:07.778
Must have just
partied too hard,

22:07.812 --> 22:09.279
and now... Ow!

22:09.314 --> 22:11.114
A woman gave us her underpants?

22:12.784 --> 22:14.451
Breathe on me.

22:15.753 --> 22:17.353
There's no alcohol
on your breath.

22:17.388 --> 22:19.355
Just gefilte fish curry
like always.

22:19.389 --> 22:20.856
Last thing I remember was that

22:20.891 --> 22:22.492
there was something going on
underneath the Buy More.

22:22.526 --> 22:25.962
Wait. We left ourselves a clue.

22:25.996 --> 22:29.298
"Bo Derek"?

22:33.335 --> 22:35.737
So...

22:35.771 --> 22:38.605
Bo...

22:38.639 --> 22:40.574
Bo Derek...

22:40.609 --> 22:42.677
tell me about your night
with Morgan,

22:42.711 --> 22:44.178
and this time
for real.

22:44.212 --> 22:45.479
Yes, please.

22:45.513 --> 22:48.348
And how Bo Derek got involved
with the Intersect.

22:48.382 --> 22:51.483
Listen, acting isn't the only
gig I got because of my looks

22:51.518 --> 22:54.086
and my capacity to make believe.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.321
Are you trying to say

22:55.355 --> 22:58.190
that Bo Derek is a spy?

22:59.459 --> 23:01.661
My boss had
gotten word

23:01.696 --> 23:04.364
someone was running around
the intelligence community,

23:04.398 --> 23:06.600
bragging that he was
the Intersect.

23:06.634 --> 23:09.669
So we were already
on the lookout for him

23:09.703 --> 23:12.939
when he surfaced so publicly
one night in Vail.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.875
Publicly?
Ah, I doubt that.

23:15.910 --> 23:19.045
Pretty sure I was keeping
a low profile.

23:19.079 --> 23:23.349
Who wants to party
with the freaking Intersect?!

23:27.087 --> 23:28.454
Whoo!

23:29.923 --> 23:32.692
I am the most powerful
weapon in the world!

23:32.726 --> 23:34.894
Whoo!

23:35.796 --> 23:37.264
Whoo!

23:37.298 --> 23:39.365
♪

23:44.901 --> 23:46.401
♪

24:12.799 --> 24:15.268
You, maybe.

24:15.302 --> 24:16.570
You, uh...

24:16.604 --> 24:18.705
Ooh...

24:23.007 --> 24:24.540
Hello...

24:28.709 --> 24:29.608
Hey, baby,

24:29.643 --> 24:31.543
you're gonna hate him!

24:32.245 --> 24:33.878
Oh, man...

24:41.951 --> 24:43.284
That was real?

24:43.319 --> 24:44.987
And a follow-up question:

24:45.021 --> 24:48.859
If that was real,
were the rainbows real?

24:49.894 --> 24:51.761
It meant nothing.

24:51.795 --> 24:53.196
It was only physical.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.432
What is it with women
and this "only phys..."?

24:55.466 --> 24:58.202
Morgan!

24:58.236 --> 25:00.704
Uh, if you don't mind,

25:00.738 --> 25:02.072
what happened next?

25:02.106 --> 25:03.973
Then I drugged you
and called my boss.

25:05.809 --> 25:12.379
So this is what they put
the Intersect into these days.

25:12.414 --> 25:15.983
What are you, an intern?

25:16.018 --> 25:18.552
Hmm? You take that back.

25:18.587 --> 25:21.822
You take that back 'cause
this Intersect...

25:21.856 --> 25:25.493
this Intersect can almost
focus on your stupid face,

25:25.527 --> 25:26.594
and when I do...

25:26.629 --> 25:28.729
Shut up.
Morgan Grimes--

25:28.763 --> 25:33.900
aka Morgan Carmichael--
which is ridiculous.

25:33.934 --> 25:37.772
You're not the only one
with the Intersect, honey bunny.

25:37.806 --> 25:39.273
I spent a lot of time

25:39.308 --> 25:40.574
and money getting
these glasses.

25:40.609 --> 25:43.243
I haven't used them yet
because I hear

25:43.278 --> 25:44.645
there are
side effects.

25:44.679 --> 25:46.446
Well, you seem fine.

25:46.481 --> 25:49.717
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's you.

25:49.752 --> 25:52.887
You made an enormous mistake
telling me all this.

25:52.921 --> 25:53.988
See your men here?
Done, finished.

25:54.022 --> 25:55.189
I'm gonna take
them out.

25:55.223 --> 25:57.157
And then I'm gonna hunt
you down,

25:57.192 --> 25:59.259
and I'm gonna arrest you
for treason.

25:59.294 --> 26:00.527
I don't think so,

26:00.562 --> 26:02.496
'cause you're not gonna
remember any of this.

26:04.499 --> 26:06.467
X-13.

26:06.501 --> 26:07.935
As soon as you
fall asleep,

26:07.969 --> 26:13.073
the last 24 hours of
your little life will

26:13.108 --> 26:15.576
just disappear.

26:15.610 --> 26:17.945
And here's
how confident I am of that.

26:22.984 --> 26:24.819
Nice to meet you.

26:24.853 --> 26:27.955
I'm Nicholas Quinn.

26:27.990 --> 26:30.124
And I'm about to become
the Intersect.

26:44.307 --> 26:45.540
Give me the glasses!

26:55.851 --> 26:57.452
Sorry, Bo Derek!

26:57.486 --> 26:59.455
Okay, so we're looking
for Nicholas Quinn.

26:59.489 --> 27:00.890
Bo Derek's been
working for him.

27:00.924 --> 27:02.658
Bo Derek's a spy?

27:02.693 --> 27:03.793
I know, right?

27:03.827 --> 27:05.295
And a talky one to boot.

27:05.329 --> 27:08.331
Quinn's got an independent
spy agency, but not like ours.

27:08.366 --> 27:10.032
Ooh, nothing like ours.

27:10.066 --> 27:12.535
This guy's list of clients
is gnarly. You're talking about

27:12.569 --> 27:14.670
Libyan Islamic fighting group,
Kim Jong-il.

27:14.704 --> 27:17.506
And a couple of favorites
as well, like FULCRUM,

27:17.540 --> 27:19.308
the Ring
and Volkoff Industries.

27:19.342 --> 27:22.510
What? We've put some of his
biggest clients behind bars.

27:22.545 --> 27:24.045
Did we get Kim Jong-il?
He's been getting screwed

27:24.079 --> 27:25.980
by the Intersect for years.
No wonder he wants it.

27:26.014 --> 27:28.717
Okay, so the fat lip we can
blame on the tattoo.

27:28.751 --> 27:30.085
The ski jacket
and the boxers

27:30.119 --> 27:31.686
we can blame
on Bo Derek,

27:31.721 --> 27:32.988
but where are
the glasses?

27:33.022 --> 27:34.155
And where is this vault?

27:34.190 --> 27:36.257
I don't know.
Guys, I don't know.

27:36.291 --> 27:38.860
Bo Derek said that was the last
she saw of me.

27:38.895 --> 27:41.665
I wouldn't have just stashed
the Intersect anywhere.

27:41.699 --> 27:43.200
I would have put it
somewhere safe.

27:43.235 --> 27:45.703
Someplace that I knew. And
that's, that's my guess, anyway.

27:45.737 --> 27:48.906
Alex.

27:48.940 --> 27:50.374
Oh, boy.

27:50.408 --> 27:52.507
Okay, let me, let me deal
with this.

27:52.542 --> 27:54.009
I'll be back, uh...

27:54.043 --> 27:57.378
I gotta come clean
on a few things.

27:57.412 --> 28:00.447
Buddy, buddy, are you sure
you want to do that? Because

28:00.481 --> 28:02.049
I think maybe
we should just, you know

28:02.083 --> 28:04.451
let the past be the past.

28:04.485 --> 28:05.819
I agree. It doesn't
seem like telling her

28:05.853 --> 28:06.887
the Bo Derek story is

28:06.921 --> 28:08.563
gonna do anything
except upset her.

28:08.588 --> 28:09.588
Yeah.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.892
You slept with Bo Derek?

28:12.927 --> 28:15.128
Yeah. Maybe more than once.

28:15.162 --> 28:16.796
I acted out physically, too.

28:16.830 --> 28:18.632
And I, uh,

28:18.666 --> 28:20.068
I rocked Bo Derek's world.

28:21.170 --> 28:24.542
Sorry. Um, Morgan...
Yeah?

28:24.576 --> 28:27.045
...Dale, he doesn't matter,
okay?

28:27.079 --> 28:28.914
You don't have to make up
these stories.

28:28.948 --> 28:31.350
No, I'm not, I'm not lying.
Are you kidding me?

28:31.384 --> 28:33.485
No. I made rainbows
shoot out of this woman.

28:35.654 --> 28:37.587
There's Grimes.
Let's just confront him.

28:37.622 --> 28:39.289
I know he's
a part of this.

28:39.323 --> 28:42.056
Wait. We are being sabotaged.
Mm-hmm.

28:42.090 --> 28:45.292
We gotta fly under the radar,
quietly keep an eye on them

28:45.326 --> 28:46.960
and record on our person
anything we learn.

28:46.995 --> 28:48.428
Great idea.

28:48.463 --> 28:50.197
I gotta pee.

28:50.231 --> 28:53.767
It's 3:14 p.m.
Write that down.

28:53.801 --> 28:56.970
I think, though, it's better if
neither of us knows the details

28:57.004 --> 29:00.473
of each other's
rainbow-related activities.

29:00.507 --> 29:03.076
Look, you were
with Dale,

29:03.110 --> 29:06.412
I was with Bo Derek, we're even.
Let's move past it now.

29:06.447 --> 29:09.215
Okay. Okay, baby.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.217
We are even.

29:11.252 --> 29:13.453
That's my girl. Okay.

29:15.189 --> 29:17.123
Son, do you have
the master key?

29:17.157 --> 29:18.491
I checked the vault,
it wasn't there.

29:18.525 --> 29:21.160
What'd you just say?

29:21.195 --> 29:22.361
The key.

29:22.396 --> 29:23.696
I checked the manager's vault.

29:23.730 --> 29:25.531
Any ideas?

29:42.248 --> 29:45.150
Sweet lady Buy More.

29:48.822 --> 29:50.622
Emerald and gold.

29:51.992 --> 29:54.360
Big Mike, is there
a Buy More in Vail?

30:00.266 --> 30:02.201
Yep, there's
a Buy More in Vail,

30:02.235 --> 30:04.603
and they had a break-in
that night. Look.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.839
Of course, I knew it, I knew
I put it somewhere familiar.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.807
It's in a manager's
vault in Vail!

30:08.842 --> 30:11.810
Looks like all roads lead
to the Buy More.

30:13.780 --> 30:16.482
I'm never getting out
of this place.

30:36.231 --> 30:38.431
Wow, the Vail Buy More.

30:41.634 --> 30:44.234
Lot of broken limbs
on these morons.

30:44.269 --> 30:45.769
I think you can
only work here if

30:45.803 --> 30:46.769
you've broken
something skiing.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.972
Grimes!
Remember me, buddy?

30:50.376 --> 30:52.445
Yeah...

30:52.479 --> 30:55.114
Ha-ha, sweet! I just tweeted
you were back in town.

30:55.148 --> 30:56.715
Beers tonight to
celebrate, brah!

30:56.750 --> 30:58.384
Oh, yeah, sweet!

30:58.418 --> 31:00.252
He tweeted you're
back in town?

31:00.287 --> 31:01.754
If Quinn has
been waiting

31:01.789 --> 31:03.656
for us to come back
and search, then...

31:03.691 --> 31:05.358
We gotta hurry.

31:05.392 --> 31:07.060
I fricking hate Twitter.

31:09.262 --> 31:12.099
Hello. Excuse me, Miss... ter.

31:13.768 --> 31:15.969
Uh, we're security specialists

31:16.004 --> 31:18.906
with Carmichael Industries.
Corporate sent us

31:18.940 --> 31:20.340
to check out
the recent break-in.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.743
Bored of you.
Talk to Big Michelle.

31:25.447 --> 31:26.847
Right.

31:49.172 --> 31:51.139
Our security is rock-solid.

31:51.174 --> 31:53.107
I don't understand why
Corporate felt we needed

31:53.142 --> 31:54.342
to be checked up on.

31:54.377 --> 31:56.378
This isn't any sort of
criticism on your store.

31:56.412 --> 31:59.147
We just want to do a
proper check for your safety.

31:59.182 --> 32:01.183
Now, if you could
first take us

32:01.217 --> 32:02.784
to the manager's vault
for a look-see.

32:02.818 --> 32:06.054
Oh, man...

32:06.088 --> 32:07.621
How's a nice security
check feel, Casey?

32:07.656 --> 32:10.225
This is about as extreme
as it will get in our new job.

32:10.259 --> 32:12.127
Nice, easy-peasy
last mission.

32:12.161 --> 32:13.962
Well, it ain't over.
Keep your guard up.

32:13.996 --> 32:16.263
I just don't understand

32:16.297 --> 32:18.165
why no one told me
you were coming.

32:18.199 --> 32:19.866
I'm gonna have to call

32:19.900 --> 32:22.568
and get the go-ahead before
I open the vault, obviously.

32:27.439 --> 32:29.474
Well, so much for her
helping us open the vault.

32:29.508 --> 32:31.175
Looks like we're gonna do
some safecracking today.

32:31.209 --> 32:32.844
Yeah, well,
hold on a second.

32:32.878 --> 32:33.845
Maybe not.

32:33.879 --> 32:35.413
Let me try something
real quick here.

32:35.447 --> 32:36.914
One, two, three,
four... boom.

32:39.751 --> 32:40.717
Seriously.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.052
I was too lazy to change

32:42.087 --> 32:43.288
the code in Burbank, too.

32:43.322 --> 32:45.190
One thing you can always
count on: Buy More laziness.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.762
Oh, no.

32:50.797 --> 32:52.331
<i>Where else could they be?</i>

32:52.365 --> 32:53.765
Maybe somebody
moved them.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.768
Like, maybe the person who is
currently knocked out cold.

32:56.802 --> 32:58.570
The place is hopping right now.

33:00.406 --> 33:03.274
This is the new expansion pack
for <i>Gunz 'n Gold.</i>

33:05.477 --> 33:07.345
The vault...

33:08.915 --> 33:11.183
Could it be?

33:16.422 --> 33:17.356
A display copy.

33:23.996 --> 33:25.263
Okay, well,
nice work, Morgan.

33:25.297 --> 33:26.697
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

33:26.731 --> 33:27.931
Let's go.

33:40.182 --> 33:41.382
J'accuse!

33:41.417 --> 33:43.717
You people are spies!

33:43.752 --> 33:45.786
And we are not
going to forget it,

33:45.820 --> 33:48.222
because it is
right here on my arm.

33:48.257 --> 33:50.459
Yeah! What he said!

33:56.700 --> 33:57.800
Everybody out!

34:00.872 --> 34:02.506
Charles Carmichael.

34:04.441 --> 34:07.577
First guy who got it
instead of me.

34:07.611 --> 34:10.080
What are you talking about?

34:10.114 --> 34:12.516
I'm former CIA, too.

34:15.186 --> 34:19.190
The Intersect was
supposed to be mine.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.926
But then Larkin
stole it for you,

34:21.960 --> 34:24.495
so I went back
out in the field,

34:24.529 --> 34:27.197
and I got captured.

34:27.232 --> 34:30.601
Oh, and tortured...

34:30.635 --> 34:34.438
in a hole the ground,
for 378 days.

34:34.472 --> 34:36.106
In a hole!

34:36.141 --> 34:38.976
That was the best.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.078
And then I was broken.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.348
Dismissed.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.384
And all because
the Intersect wasn't mine.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.851
You don't want it, Quinn.

34:46.886 --> 34:48.487
You do not want it.
Trust me.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.855
It doesn't
work right, okay?

34:49.889 --> 34:51.190
I lost memories,
important movies,

34:51.224 --> 34:52.690
a bunch of stuff.

34:52.726 --> 34:53.792
He's right. He's right.

34:53.827 --> 34:54.994
Listen, you don't
want to trust me.

34:55.027 --> 34:56.462
Nothing good can
come from it.

34:59.566 --> 35:01.033
Take a good look at your wife.

35:01.067 --> 35:03.067
You think you'd get that
without the Intersect?

35:04.937 --> 35:06.738
I tried to win without it.

35:06.773 --> 35:09.708
I... I tried.

35:11.043 --> 35:12.877
Now give it to me!

35:16.081 --> 35:18.383
Jeffrey... run!

35:44.775 --> 35:46.409
Nice shot!

35:57.487 --> 35:58.554
Thank you.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.591
No, no, Casey--
Casey, wait.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.259
Quinn didn't get the Intersect.
We did it!

36:09.293 --> 36:10.860
We took down his team.

36:10.895 --> 36:12.128
Okay, let's call Beckman.

36:12.162 --> 36:12.995
Call the authorities.

36:13.030 --> 36:14.063
Tell them where he is.

36:14.097 --> 36:16.365
But... let's be done.

36:16.399 --> 36:18.533
Can't we just be done?

36:18.567 --> 36:21.035
We survived our
last mission.

36:21.070 --> 36:22.436
Let's leave behind the Intersect

36:22.471 --> 36:24.939
and everyone involved with it,
and be done.

36:27.243 --> 36:29.910
Okay.

36:29.945 --> 36:31.779
We're done.

36:31.813 --> 36:33.747
Okay. I'll call Beckman.
Whoa!

36:35.683 --> 36:37.951
I'm not done.
No, I am not done.

36:37.985 --> 36:40.786
I would like very much
to forget everything--

36:40.821 --> 36:42.555
everything that I saw
here today.

36:42.589 --> 36:43.956
Here we go again.

36:43.990 --> 36:45.524
I'm scarred.

36:45.558 --> 36:47.025
Aw, buddy.
So scarred.

36:47.059 --> 36:48.326
Sorry, Casey.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.294
Looks like we can't
kick the creepy cousin

36:50.329 --> 36:51.529
out of the family
just yet.

37:07.515 --> 37:09.617
I knew it-- there's no alcohol
on your breath.

37:09.651 --> 37:11.721
It's just gefilte fish
curry, like always.

37:11.755 --> 37:13.893
I believe we've
been set up.

37:13.928 --> 37:15.028
And what's all this?

37:17.198 --> 37:18.933
Huh.

37:18.967 --> 37:20.735
We must've gotten
to the bottom of it, then.

37:22.471 --> 37:24.271
Guess we were wrong.

37:24.306 --> 37:26.272
That's kind of disappointing.

37:26.306 --> 37:28.372
So now what do we do?

37:34.679 --> 37:36.413
Hey, boys.

37:36.448 --> 37:37.915
Morgan told me you might've
gotten stranded.

37:37.949 --> 37:39.917
Yeah, apparently, we did.

37:39.951 --> 37:41.218
Cheer up!

37:41.252 --> 37:43.854
I brought turkey BLT
Subway footlongs.

37:43.888 --> 37:45.922
From the Fresh Fit menu?

37:45.956 --> 37:48.291
Yep.
Watching my weight.

37:48.325 --> 37:49.125
How many you have?

37:49.159 --> 37:50.793
Only two.

37:50.827 --> 37:53.929
Also, I had a thought.
Mm-hmm.

37:53.964 --> 37:55.464
We're already halfway to Vegas...
Mm-hmm.

37:55.499 --> 37:59.835
and Bologna's doing some
Native American feelings workshop

37:59.870 --> 38:01.370
about her period
all weekend.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.772
Ew.
But are you saying...?

38:03.807 --> 38:06.208
Vegas, baby!

38:06.242 --> 38:09.211
♪

38:28.264 --> 38:29.498
Sarah?

38:29.532 --> 38:31.200
Hey. Did I wake you?

38:31.234 --> 38:34.069
No, it's... I mean, yeah,
but it's okay.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.637
Where are you so early?

38:35.671 --> 38:37.138
I'm sorry, I-I couldn't sleep.

38:37.172 --> 38:40.743
I'm just, uh, I'm so excited
about starting everything.

38:40.777 --> 38:43.178
I made an appointment at noon

38:43.213 --> 38:44.846
to check out some of these
new office spaces,

38:44.881 --> 38:47.182
and I thought that we could get
Casey and Morgan together

38:47.216 --> 38:51.052
and, um...
have a little ceremony.

38:51.086 --> 38:52.687
You know, pop some champagne

38:52.721 --> 38:55.623
and toast to our futures,
and, uh...

38:55.658 --> 38:58.793
destroy the Intersect glasses.

38:58.827 --> 39:01.195
I, um, I-I think that's
the right end to this.

39:01.229 --> 39:03.130
Yeah.
That sounds perfect.

39:03.164 --> 39:07.767
Turns out saying "last mission"
wasn't a jinx after all, huh?

39:07.802 --> 39:09.669
I love you, Chuck.

39:09.704 --> 39:11.338
I love you, too, babe.
Good-bye.

39:11.372 --> 39:12.973
Bye.

39:17.978 --> 39:20.546
Never let the bad guy get away.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.534
Hey.

39:39.568 --> 39:40.902
I have your husband.

39:40.936 --> 39:44.639
Bring the Intersect to the
San Pedro docks, Pier 23,

39:44.673 --> 39:48.709
2100 hours, or he dies.

40:14.001 --> 40:15.235
Casey, where is everyone?

40:15.269 --> 40:17.704
You got anything?

40:30.051 --> 40:31.552
Casey, hold your fire.
They've got Chuck.

40:32.821 --> 40:35.256
Sarah Walker,
put the glasses down.

40:35.290 --> 40:38.592
You show me Chuck first.

40:38.627 --> 40:40.628
Situation's changed.

40:40.662 --> 40:42.962
He'll be needed.
Now put the glasses down

40:42.996 --> 40:44.363
on the ground in front of you.

41:05.916 --> 41:08.451
It was a trap!
Where is he?

41:08.485 --> 41:10.550
I don't know!
We gotta get out of here!

41:22.357 --> 41:24.259
Casey, you got an exit?

41:24.293 --> 41:26.229
No!

41:26.263 --> 41:28.332
No, not from here.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.809
What's our next move?

41:46.613 --> 41:48.580
I've got one clip left.

42:01.193 --> 42:02.594
Walker, no!

42:02.628 --> 42:04.863
Don't do it!

42:15.943 --> 42:18.377
Okay, I got this.
