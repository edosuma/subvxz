00:14.047 --> 00:16.038
Are you breaking up with me?

00:17.784 --> 00:21.049
Well, are you giving back that ring?

00:23.990 --> 00:26.823
- Yes.
- <i>Then...</i>

00:29.462 --> 00:31.453
yes.

00:51.117 --> 00:53.108
That first kiss.

00:53.186 --> 00:55.848
Okay, well, I'm gonna call it a day.

00:55.922 --> 00:58.152
Good night.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.215
Night.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.161
By the way, thanks for the ride.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.732
God, I wish we'd never kissed.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.176
<i>Geez, what a drama queen.</i>

01:21.881 --> 01:24.441
- Who are you?
- Let's go.

01:24.517 --> 01:28.317
- Go where?
- Well, you said you wished that you'd never kissed her.

01:28.388 --> 01:32.222
- I can show you what would've happened if you never did.
- What are you, like, a genie?

01:32.292 --> 01:35.659
Genies aren't real.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.889
I'm an angel.

01:37.964 --> 01:39.955
You're not an angel.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.524
You don't even float.
Everyone knows angels float.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.729
Fine.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.768
Eric Forman...

01:50.844 --> 01:54.177
God's favorite cherub...

01:54.247 --> 01:56.238
come with me...

01:56.316 --> 01:59.683
and I will release you
of your suffering.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.845
Don't be afraid...

02:01.921 --> 02:03.912
little one.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.482
No offense, but...
are you coming on to me?

02:08.527 --> 02:11.964
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, why not?

02:21.808 --> 02:25.767
Okay, well, I'm gonna call it a day.

02:25.845 --> 02:28.211
Good night.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.272
Night.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.409
And there you go.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.388
You and Donna never kissed.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.949
Well, thanks.
This was nice.

02:41.027 --> 02:44.155
- Good night.
- No, no.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.698
We're gonna follow her home
and see what happened next.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.132
Are you an angel or a stalker?

02:49.202 --> 02:51.534
Hey, let me do my job.

02:51.604 --> 02:55.267
I'm gonna prove to you that it is
better to have loved and lost...

02:55.341 --> 02:58.105
than never to have
loved at all, ya pansy.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.584
Hyde was waiting for her that night?

03:40.653 --> 03:42.644
- I didn't know that.
- Shh.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.747
This is my favorite part.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.084
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.458
- Thanks.
- So you with Forman now?

03:53.533 --> 03:55.933
I guess not.

03:56.002 --> 03:59.460
- I mean, he didn't make a move or anything, so...
- Huh.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.530
Yeah.

04:05.745 --> 04:09.738
- Hyde, what are you doing? Get the hell off her!
- Eric, they can't hear you.

04:09.816 --> 04:13.650
Don't you watch movies?
I mean, this is pretty basic stuff here.

04:19.058 --> 04:21.822
Well, Eric, it's three months later.

04:21.894 --> 04:27.059
<i>Donna's with Hyde, Kelso's with Jackie,</i>
<i>and you became... Just watch.</i>

04:27.133 --> 04:30.398
Does anyone want to watch <i>Flipper?</i>

04:31.671 --> 04:33.662
Anyone?

04:33.740 --> 04:38.734
Eric, I thought I told you
to tar the driveway.

04:38.811 --> 04:41.473
Yeah, but I'm hanging out
with my friends.

04:41.547 --> 04:45.244
Oh, oh!
I'm so sorry!

04:45.318 --> 04:47.809
Now get your ass up there
and get to work!

04:49.155 --> 04:51.919
<i>You people, out of the basement!</i>

04:53.159 --> 04:56.219
Oh, geez. I'm sorry, Dad.
Don't be mad.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.660
This is made-up angel crap.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.895
I wouldn't cave to Red like that.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.406
Ah, you've already forgotten
what a wuss you were.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.909
See, it was Donna who gave you
the confidence to stand up to Red.

05:10.977 --> 05:16.074
Oh, I'm gonna show you
a lot of neat stuff like this.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.777
Well, I guess I have no choice.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.687
Like everyone doesn't try that.

05:28.528 --> 05:31.554
This can't be that bad.
I'm wearing a letter sweater.

05:31.631 --> 05:34.691
Chess Club, loser.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.727
Ah, checkmate!

05:44.410 --> 05:46.901
Hey, I made the marching band.

05:46.979 --> 05:51.507
Ooh, at last I will be accepted
by the cool kids and not get beat up.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.779
Ay, no.
Not again, guys.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.594
Hey, I got you a birthday present.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.131
- What is it?
- A tattoo.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.463
"Question Authority."

06:08.534 --> 06:11.435
- Cool. I love you, man.
- Prove it.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.869
My Donna would never get a tattoo.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.276
No, but Hyde's Donna would.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.315
Hi, guys.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.511
Oh, hey, Eric.
We didn't see you there.

06:26.586 --> 06:30.022
Yeah, most people don't.
Yeah.

06:30.089 --> 06:33.855
Huh. So, do you
still live next door?

06:33.926 --> 06:35.917
Oh, yeah!
You bet. Yeah.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.431
So...
Hey, Hyde, how are you?

06:40.500 --> 06:43.867
Great. My mom split, so...
droppin' out of school.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.927
Oh, man.

06:46.005 --> 06:50.032
Look, Hyde, you can stay at my house.
Then you won't have to drop out.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.372
Okay, Mom.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.475
Now get one of me
giving her the corsage.

06:59.552 --> 07:02.316
Let's roll, Twiggy.
My bra's about to snap.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.686
I went to prom with Big Rhonda?

07:04.757 --> 07:06.748
Sweet, huh?

07:06.826 --> 07:09.192
Real quick, real quick.
Now, Rhoda...

07:09.262 --> 07:12.026
It's Rhonda!
Rhon-da! God!

07:12.098 --> 07:16.592
Rhon-da. I'm so sorry, dear.

07:16.669 --> 07:19.331
I told you he'd fall for
the first piece of tail that came along.

07:19.405 --> 07:22.397
Shh! Okay...

07:22.475 --> 07:24.773
Okay.
Now smile!

07:24.844 --> 07:28.678
Big night!
Big everything.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.040
I'll make you a copy.

07:32.118 --> 07:37.886
Yeah, I want to remember this night.
Whoo!

07:37.957 --> 07:40.391
Here, Son.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.519
You'll need this.

07:42.595 --> 07:45.086
Girls like her...
They like to eat before the prom.

07:46.766 --> 07:48.927
Good luck, Son.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.903
Hmm, another tattoo.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.001
"Property of Hyde."

07:59.078 --> 08:01.512
Classy!

08:06.652 --> 08:09.985
What?
What's Fez doing?

08:10.056 --> 08:14.686
- Step away from that stereo!
- But, Hyde, I got the new Leo Sayer album.

08:16.262 --> 08:20.596
Hey, everybody! I just made Forman a man.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.794
Well, as much of a man
as he'll ever be.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.940
Kelso and Pam Macy?

08:30.009 --> 08:35.072
- But Kelso and Jackie got back together on prom night.
- Never happened.

08:35.147 --> 08:38.878
I wrote you a love poem, Pam.
It goes like this:

08:38.951 --> 08:40.942
I love your rack.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.010
I'd love to shack...

08:43.089 --> 08:45.080
up with you and do it too.

08:46.158 --> 08:49.355
Oh, Michael.
That is so deep.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.864
Yeah, I kicked that poem's ass!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.691
It's all a domino effect, Eric.

08:56.769 --> 09:01.263
You see, Hyde wasn't there to take Jackie
to prom, so she couldn't make up with Kelso.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.864
See?

09:09.916 --> 09:12.908
Oh, my God.
That's so sad.

09:12.985 --> 09:17.547
It's like my relationship with Donna
touched everyone's life.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.786
And I was just gonna throw that a...

09:22.862 --> 09:25.558
Okay, you're unpleasant.

09:25.631 --> 09:29.397
Just give it up. I don't care.
None of this is really that bad anyway.

09:29.468 --> 09:32.266
Well, it gets a lot worse.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.000
Come on.
We're going into the future.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.407
That's right: The '80s.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.140
Hey, what the hell was that?

09:45.217 --> 09:47.913
Oh, you'll find out.

09:57.996 --> 10:02.092
Welcome to 1983...
Donna and Hyde's wedding.

10:03.835 --> 10:06.167
<i>Man, did you have to make her pregnant?</i>

10:06.237 --> 10:08.797
Good God, I wish I could just wake up.

10:08.873 --> 10:13.435
Oh-Oh, you may never wake up.
This could be a coma dream.

10:14.612 --> 10:17.945
Congratulations,
Mr. And Mrs. Steven Hyde...

10:18.016 --> 10:20.883
from Cedar Rapids's
number one anchorman.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.386
Kelso, man, glad you could make it.

10:24.456 --> 10:27.619
- Hey, oh, man, can I kiss the bride?
- Sure.

10:29.561 --> 10:33.759
Damn it, Kelso!
You don't French the bride!

10:36.601 --> 10:38.967
Where's the food?

10:39.037 --> 10:42.200
- Please, honey, for the love of God...
- Don't "honey" me.

10:42.273 --> 10:44.571
I'm hungry, stick man.

10:49.013 --> 10:53.109
Hey, Forman, so when are you
and Big Rhonda gonna tie the knot, huh?

10:53.184 --> 10:55.175
Oh, I don't know.

10:55.253 --> 10:59.883
You know, I'm so busy at Price Mart,
and, uh, she has her dog grooming...

10:59.958 --> 11:02.791
and her cheating on me, so...

11:05.697 --> 11:09.292
Jackie... Burkhart?
Is that you?

11:09.367 --> 11:11.927
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

11:12.003 --> 11:16.463
It's Michael. Kelso?

11:17.542 --> 11:19.942
It rings a stupid, little bell.

11:22.013 --> 11:26.074
You know, I bet if I wasn't so happy
as a globe-trotting stewardess...

11:26.151 --> 11:29.609
I might actually remember the tiny effect
you had on me in high school.

11:29.687 --> 11:33.123
- I'm on TV now.
- I've always loved you.

11:40.832 --> 11:44.768
- Ow!
- Oh, oh, Jake, honey, honey. Be nice to your big brother.

11:44.836 --> 11:47.236
He's not strong like you.

11:48.807 --> 11:50.798
"Brother"?
What the hell?

11:50.875 --> 11:54.311
Your parents finally had
the son they always wanted.

11:54.379 --> 11:59.339
- Now, Son, what do we call Eric?
- Dumb-ass!

11:59.417 --> 12:01.408
There's my boy!

12:04.055 --> 12:06.148
Oh, what a wonderful wedding.

12:06.224 --> 12:11.719
It's so nice when children get married and...
and move far away from their parents.

12:11.796 --> 12:15.892
Or they don't get married
and stay at home with their mother...

12:15.967 --> 12:17.958
who they just couldn't stand to be...

12:18.036 --> 12:20.266
Away from.

12:21.773 --> 12:23.798
Oh, God.

12:26.811 --> 12:30.975
Hey, Kelso, man.
I just opened your wedding gift.

12:31.049 --> 12:34.018
It's primo. What do you
say we go break it in?

12:34.085 --> 12:36.849
All right!

12:36.921 --> 12:40.357
You're leaving?
I hate you! Call me.

12:41.793 --> 12:45.627
- Fez.
- Good night, Wisconsin!

12:51.402 --> 12:54.530
This is really...

12:54.606 --> 12:58.303
I've really missed...

13:00.078 --> 13:02.376
We have breaking news.

13:02.447 --> 13:04.438
I'm toasted.

13:06.818 --> 13:09.616
Man, they pay me gobs of money
to talk like that.

13:12.190 --> 13:16.217
Fez, do something with your hair, man.
It's making me paranoid.

13:20.798 --> 13:25.565
Guys, I have discovered a band
that will change music forever.

13:41.319 --> 13:43.310
I love to cook, you know?

13:45.156 --> 13:47.454
I'm really good with sauces.

13:48.526 --> 13:51.393
Guys, sometimes when I do the news...

13:51.462 --> 13:54.124
I don't wear any pants!

13:56.267 --> 13:58.258
Whoo!

13:59.470 --> 14:02.371
You know, there are
some things about Earth...

14:03.374 --> 14:05.706
I really miss!

14:11.549 --> 14:15.781
Okay, welcome to your
10-year high school reunion.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.920
All right!
I finally grew a mustache!

14:23.995 --> 14:26.657
Actually, it's chocolate cake.

14:34.839 --> 14:38.798
- What happened to Kelso?
- Oh, he got fired.

14:38.876 --> 14:42.710
Yeah, he thought the news
would be funnier drunk.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.078
Now he works for you,
selling water beds.

14:45.149 --> 14:48.312
What a loser!

14:48.386 --> 14:50.911
- Wait, I sell water beds?
- That's right.

14:54.659 --> 14:58.595
Kelso, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to lock up the store tonight.

14:58.663 --> 15:01.097
It's our reunion, man.

15:01.165 --> 15:03.326
I'll lock it up tomorrow, I promise.

15:05.370 --> 15:08.430
- Hello, Michael.
- Hello, Jackie.

15:08.506 --> 15:12.237
Oh, I just want to let you to know that,
uh, I married Pam Macy.

15:12.310 --> 15:16.269
She's one hell of a cook, a super lady,
and I'm really, really happy.

15:18.383 --> 15:20.817
Good, 'cause I wouldn't
be with you anyway.

15:20.885 --> 15:22.876
You're fat.

15:28.993 --> 15:33.396
Okay, Michael. When you're done being a pig,
I'll be in the Le Car.

15:39.904 --> 15:41.929
Uh, I'm sorry, Rhonda.

15:42.006 --> 15:45.533
- Uh, yeah.
- Rhonda? Oh, my God, Rhonda!

15:45.610 --> 15:48.807
Hi, Eric. Uh, I was hoping you'd be here.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.043
- I just wanted to thank you.
- Thank me?

15:52.116 --> 15:56.780
Yes. Um, after you broke up with me,
I was so disgusted with my life.

15:56.854 --> 16:00.312
I mean, if someone like you
didn't want to see me... Whoo!

16:03.061 --> 16:06.895
So, thanks to you and Jane Fonda,
I have this new, fabulous body...

16:06.964 --> 16:10.263
and a successful aerobics studio.

16:10.334 --> 16:12.700
Well, hey, you know what?

16:12.770 --> 16:15.261
- I'm glad I could help.
- Yeah.

16:57.815 --> 17:00.181
Oh, hey! Hi!
Hey, Donna.

17:00.251 --> 17:03.448
It's... It's Eric Forman...

17:03.521 --> 17:05.579
from, uh, Point Place High School.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.819
Yeah, Eric, I know.
It's our reunion.

17:08.893 --> 17:10.986
Right. Good one.

17:13.131 --> 17:16.931
- So, how are you doing?
- Um, I was pretty lousy...

17:17.001 --> 17:20.198
until I saw how fat Kelso got.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.035
- It made the drive from Joliet worth it.
- Oh, right.

17:23.107 --> 17:25.734
- I heard you guys moved. How's Hyde?
- Hyde's good.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.836
Kids are good.
He's gone a lot.

17:28.913 --> 17:30.904
Prison. Whatever.

17:32.049 --> 17:34.540
So, Eric, uh, how... how are you?

17:34.619 --> 17:36.610
I'm, uh, great.

17:36.687 --> 17:39.986
I'm the number three water-bed dealer
in Wisconsin. So...

17:44.529 --> 17:47.862
- Donna, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.

17:49.066 --> 17:53.093
You know, don't laugh, but...

17:54.806 --> 17:58.207
- Actually, never mind.
- No, no. What?

17:58.276 --> 18:00.642
I had a crush on you in high school.

18:00.711 --> 18:03.009
I had a crush on you too.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.480
You know, I almost kissed you once.

18:07.084 --> 18:10.247
What might've been, huh?

18:13.991 --> 18:17.427
So...
So are you... are you still writing?

18:17.495 --> 18:21.898
Oh, God.
Well, I mean, permission slips.

18:21.966 --> 18:25.026
- Three kids, you know.
- Right.

18:25.102 --> 18:28.503
Well, you should start again,
'cause, you know...

18:29.507 --> 18:31.498
you were really good at it.

18:31.576 --> 18:33.737
Oh, well, it's too late for that.

18:35.646 --> 18:37.807
It's too late for a lot of...

18:41.118 --> 18:44.349
- Hey, so I'll see you, Eric.
- Yeah, I'll see ya, Donna.

18:44.422 --> 18:46.617
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:54.332 --> 18:56.459
Huh? Huh?

18:57.535 --> 18:59.526
Start the waterworks.

18:59.604 --> 19:03.563
- Sorry.
- Come on. You gotta feel something.

19:03.641 --> 19:07.907
Yeah... envy.
He never had to feel the pain of losing her.

19:07.979 --> 19:12.973
Oh, wait a minute.
You actually had a relationship with Donna?

19:13.050 --> 19:16.508
- Wait, I thought you said he couldn't hear me.
- I'm loose with the rules.

19:16.587 --> 19:20.614
- So sue me.
- No, seriously. You had Donna?

19:20.691 --> 19:24.149
Look... We broke up.
You're much better off.

19:24.228 --> 19:26.958
Says you!
Look at me!

19:27.031 --> 19:29.022
I'm 28 years old.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.866
I've only had sex with Big Rhonda,
and all three times, believe me...

19:32.937 --> 19:35.565
she did not look like that!

19:35.640 --> 19:38.871
Idiot! You're sad you were
never with Donna?

19:38.943 --> 19:42.572
Well, you got off light, man!
I had her, and I lost her!

19:42.647 --> 19:46.777
And believe me,
you don't want to know how bad that hurts!

19:53.124 --> 19:55.217
So...

19:55.293 --> 19:59.195
- you're an angel, right?
- Why, yes. Yes I am.

19:59.263 --> 20:03.097
Can you, like...
Can you do anything to help me?

20:03.167 --> 20:06.034
Listen closely:

20:06.103 --> 20:08.094
No.

20:12.510 --> 20:16.810
You know, Angel, thanks.

20:16.881 --> 20:20.715
But I've got to go to sleep,
'cause I have a big day of...

20:21.719 --> 20:23.812
misery ahead of me.

20:24.889 --> 20:27.380
Okay, you win.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.688
It was better never
to have loved at all.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.751
Thank you!

20:31.829 --> 20:34.389
And, hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

20:34.465 --> 20:37.593
I'm gonna take it all away.

20:37.668 --> 20:40.637
You won't feel a thing... good or bad.

20:40.705 --> 20:45.233
Really?
Yes. Yes, do it.

20:45.309 --> 20:48.972
Okay. Well, let me just remind you
what you're giving up.

20:49.046 --> 20:51.037
Hang on.

21:13.704 --> 21:16.195
Wait. No.
I want to keep it.

21:16.273 --> 21:18.901
Please, just...

21:18.976 --> 21:21.342
let me keep it.
