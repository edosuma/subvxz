WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:11.567
- DEAN SPECTER, SO NICE
TO HAVE YOU IN OUR HOUSE.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.733
- MR. PRESTON,

00:13.767 --> 00:16.333
WE TAKE OUR ANNUAL STUDENT
REVIEWS VERY SERIOUSLY

00:16.367 --> 00:18.733
AT ICHABOD CRANE
GHOST ACADEMY--

00:18.767 --> 00:21.800
- GO, HEADLESS HORSEMEN!

00:21.833 --> 00:25.100
- IF I MAY.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.767
LET'S BEGIN WITH YOUR YOUNGEST.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.100
WHILE LOUIE HAS POTENTIAL,

00:29.133 --> 00:32.733
THE BOY LACKS FOCUS
AND IS FAILING EVERY SUBJECT.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.433
I GOT POTENTIAL.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.400
OH, YEAH.

00:37.433 --> 00:42.333
- BUT, AT THE MOMENT, LOUIE'S
GOING THROUGH A "LIME PHASE."

00:42.367 --> 00:44.167
- IS THAT
SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM?

00:44.200 --> 00:47.367
- NO. HE KEEPS TURNING HIMSELF
INTO A LIME.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.633
- I CAN'T HELP IT IF LIMES

00:50.667 --> 00:53.100
KEEP POPPING INTO MY HEAD
EVERY TIME I SCARE.

00:53.133 --> 00:57.200
I MEAN, TRY NOT THINKING
ABOUT LIMES RIGHT NOW.

00:57.233 --> 01:00.833
YOU CAN'T DO IT, CAN YOU?

01:02.867 --> 01:05.133
- THAT'S HOW HE ROLLS
HIS EYES AT US.

01:05.167 --> 01:06.933
- I GET IT, SON.
THANKS.

01:09.867 --> 01:12.667
- WHICH BRINGS US TO MILES.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.667
HE'S FRIENDLY,
POLITE, CONSIDERATE.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.633
IN OTHER WORDS...

01:17.667 --> 01:20.300
HE'S A TERRIBLE GHOST.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.600
- I MAY NOT HAUNT,
BUT I SURE HAVE SPIRIT!

01:26.833 --> 01:29.667
HERE WE GO, HORSEMEN,
HERE WE GO! WHOO!

01:29.700 --> 01:31.300
- HE DIDN'T
MAKE THE CHEER SQUAD.

01:31.333 --> 01:34.067
LET IT GO!

01:34.100 --> 01:37.067
- DON'T WORRY, DEAN SPECTER.
I'LL KEEP WORKING WITH HIM.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.433
- YOU BETTER.

01:38.467 --> 01:41.533
WE GHOSTS HAVE
A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD.

01:41.567 --> 01:44.500
AS FOR NOW,
I BID YOU ADIEU.

01:46.433 --> 01:49.633
OH, DON'T FORGET,
YOU'RE SNACK DAD NEXT WEEK.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.467
- MILES, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.167
BUT, AS YOUR DAD,

01:59.200 --> 02:01.233
I WOULDN'T BE DOING MY JOB
IF I DIDN'T

02:01.267 --> 02:04.133
STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING
THE BEST GHOST YOU CAN BE.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.900
- I CAN'T HELP IT, DAD.

02:05.933 --> 02:08.233
I'M A PEOPLE PERSON.
IT'S JUST WHO I AM.

02:08.267 --> 02:10.067
- DON'T WORRY, POPS.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.500
YOU HAVE ONE SON
WHO CAN BRING THE SCARE.

02:16.233 --> 02:19.233
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING?

02:24.867 --> 02:27.700
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:27.733 --> 02:30.567
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:30.600 --> 02:32.667
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:32.700 --> 02:36.633
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:36.667 --> 02:39.067
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:39.100 --> 02:40.500
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:40.533 --> 02:43.367
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:43.400 --> 02:46.233
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:46.267 --> 02:48.300
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:48.333 --> 02:51.733
*

02:51.767 --> 02:54.100
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:54.133 --> 02:55.400
*

03:00.300 --> 03:02.667
- SOPHIE, WE SHOULD TOTALLY
REVERSE DRESS TOMORROW.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.533
YOU WEAR A BLACK TOP
WITH PINK PANTS,

03:04.567 --> 03:06.300
AND I'LL WEAR
A PINK TOP WITH BLACK PANTS.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.333
- EXCUSE ME, MISS,
YOU FORGOT MY FORK.

03:08.367 --> 03:09.767
- SORRY.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.100
- TAYLOR, CUSTOMERS.

03:13.133 --> 03:15.700
- I KNOW.
ANNOYING, RIGHT?

03:15.733 --> 03:18.400
- MOM, MOM, MOM, MOM, MOM, MOM--

03:20.433 --> 03:22.333
- YOU KNOW THAT NEW BAKERY
ACROSS THE STREET?

03:22.367 --> 03:25.567
WE DID A LITTLE RECON
TO CHECK OUT THE COMPETITION.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.833
FREE T-SHIRTS.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.533
THIS GUY CAME TO PLAY.

03:29.567 --> 03:32.633
- FRANKIE, THERE'S
ENOUGH ROOM ON THIS BLOCK

03:32.667 --> 03:34.500
FOR TWO BAKERIES.

03:34.533 --> 03:37.133
DON'T OVERREACT.

03:37.167 --> 03:39.067
THE MAN'S GOT SIGN SPINNERS?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.300
WE'RE SO DOOMED!

03:43.567 --> 03:46.700
- HE ALSO HAS FREE WI-FI,
AMPLE PARKING...

03:48.633 --> 03:52.067
THAT STARTS IN FIVE MINUTES!
WE GOTTA GO!

03:55.067 --> 03:57.767
- TAYLOR, I NEED YOU.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.233
NO.
SHE'LL CALL YOU BACK.

04:00.267 --> 04:02.633
IF I'M GONNA COMPETE
WITH BIG RONNIE,

04:02.667 --> 04:04.167
I NEED TO DRAW UP
SOME PROMOTION.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.267
WHILE I'M AWAY,
YOU ARE IN CHARGE.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.267
NO GABBING WITH FRIENDS.
FOCUS.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.333
MOM, I HATE WHEN YOU TALK TO ME

04:10.367 --> 04:12.233
LIKE I'M
SOME IRRESPONSIBLE TEEN.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.800
SORRY.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.200
MY MOM WAS BABBLING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

04:19.233 --> 04:22.100
SO WE'RE GONNA GO
WITH THE PINK SUNGLASSES?

04:22.133 --> 04:25.200
- EXCUSE ME, MISS.

04:25.233 --> 04:28.367
I'M DEATHLY ALLERGIC
TO CINNAMON.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.600
IS THERE ANY IN THIS RECIPE?

04:31.633 --> 04:33.467
- LET ME CHECK
MY MOM'S RECIPE BOOK.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.267
SOPHIE, NO WAY.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.400
NO WAY!

04:37.433 --> 04:41.700
NO WAY.

04:41.733 --> 04:43.067
UGH, I WORK TOO HARD.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.067
BACK IN A SEC.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.200
- I KNEW THAT PUPPET SHOW
WOULD BE SOLD OUT.

04:48.233 --> 04:51.167
NEXT TIME,
WE GET IN LINE EARLY.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.800
- SOPHIE, THAT IS REDONKULOUS.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.867
- OH, MY GOSH, MA'AM,
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:02.233 --> 05:03.267
- HEY!

05:03.300 --> 05:04.667
YOU'RE BIG RONNIE!

05:04.700 --> 05:07.433
NO, I'M NOT!

05:07.467 --> 05:09.800
- YEAH, YOU'RE THE GUY
ON HER T-SHIRT.

05:09.833 --> 05:13.167
NO, I'M A HARMLESS OLD LADY.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.133
NOW MOVE IT.

05:21.533 --> 05:25.267
OH, NO!
MOM'S RECIPE BOOK IS GONE!

05:25.300 --> 05:28.467
I LEFT IT OUT.
BIG RONNIE MUST HAVE STOLEN IT.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.633
- OOH, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.767
- THOSE ARE
HER SECRET PIE RECIPES.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.600
MOM'S GONNA GO NUTS.

05:36.633 --> 05:37.767
WHAT DO WE DO?

05:37.800 --> 05:40.067
- WAIT, I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

05:40.067 --> 05:43.267
I DON'T NEED A TICKET
TO GET INTO A PUPPET SHOW.

05:43.300 --> 05:47.367
I'M A GHOST.
LATER.

05:49.067 --> 05:51.700
- OKAY, SO WHO'S READY
TO HAVE SOME FUN?

05:51.733 --> 05:53.067
- I AM!

05:53.067 --> 05:54.533
IS IT RECYCLING DAY?

05:54.567 --> 05:57.667
- NO, WE'RE GONNA WORK
ON YOUR SCARING.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.400
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT SOMETHING
YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM HAUNTING.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.467
IT'S A GHOST SKUNK!

06:04.500 --> 06:06.633
EVERYBODY HATES SKUNKS.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.800
I MEAN, LOOK AT
THOSE BEADY EYES,

06:07.833 --> 06:09.233
THOSE SNARLING TEETH.

06:09.267 --> 06:11.500
- OH, MY GOSH,
HE'S SO CUTE!

06:11.533 --> 06:14.167
- WHA--WAIT!

06:14.200 --> 06:16.600
N-N-NO, NOT CUTE.
SMELLY.

06:16.633 --> 06:19.567
- YOU GOT A NAME,
LITTLE FELLA?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.800
HIS WHISKERS TICKLE.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.800
- STOP THAT.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.833
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SCARE HIM.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.633
- AW, HE'S TREMBLING.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.733
COME ON, DAD.
INDOOR VOICE.

06:35.833 --> 06:38.300
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?
- AH.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.133
JUST STEPPING UP
MY BUSINESS GAME.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.800
I BOUGHT ONE OF
THOSE FLOPPY AIR GUYS

06:42.833 --> 06:44.600
TO SET UP OUTSIDE THE BAKERY.

06:44.633 --> 06:46.733
- DO THOSE THINGS
REALLY ATTRACT MORE CUSTOMERS?

06:46.767 --> 06:50.467
- UH, YEAH, THEY ONLY RAISE
BUSINESS BY 80%.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.100
- THE GUY WHO SOLD IT TO ME.

06:55.133 --> 06:58.167
I WANNA SEE BIG RONNIE
COMPETE WITH THIS.

06:58.200 --> 07:02.200
NOT JUST A HAT RACK,
MY FRIEND.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.800
HE LIKES ME.

07:18.767 --> 07:19.800
- GET IN.

07:21.833 --> 07:24.467
- NO QUESTIONS.
JUST GET IN.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.633
- OKAY...

07:29.633 --> 07:31.167
- WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.367
BIG RONNIE STOLE
MOM'S SECRET PIE RECIPES.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.233
THOSE RECIPES GO BACK
SIX GENERATIONS.

07:36.267 --> 07:38.167
HOW'D IT HAPPEN?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.067
- IT WAS ALL TAYLOR'S FAULT.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.700
BUT LET'S NOT DWELL ON THAT
RIGHT NOW.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.767
WE NEED TO GET
THOSE RECIPES BACK

07:44.800 --> 07:45.800
WITHOUT MOM KNOWING.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.333
SHE WOULD NOT HANDLE IT WELL.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.700
- ESPECIALLY WHEN
SHE FINDS OUT

07:49.733 --> 07:53.300
IT WAS ENTIRELY
TAYLOR'S FAULT.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.633
- OKAY, I GOT JUST THE PLAN.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.767
FIRST, WE ROLL OVER
TO BIG RONNIE'S, OKAY?

07:58.800 --> 08:01.633
THEN WE CONVINCE HIM
WHAT HE DID WAS MORALLY WRONG,

08:01.667 --> 08:04.500
AND POLITELY ASK HIM
TO RETURN THE RECIPES.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.467
IMPRESSED?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.100
- DEPRESSED.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.567
WE NEED TO GO OVER THERE

08:09.600 --> 08:11.433
AND SCARE THE SNOT OUT
OF THIS GUY

08:11.467 --> 08:13.300
UNTIL HE GIVES US THE BOOK BACK.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.333
- COME ON, PEOPLE,
WE'RE BETTER THAN THAT.

08:15.367 --> 08:19.333
LET'S LET MORAL HIGH GROUND BE
OUR WEAPON OF CHOICE.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.400
- SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE,
TAYLOR?

08:21.433 --> 08:25.633
CHICKEN...OR BEEF?

08:25.667 --> 08:28.500
- I GUESS I'M GOING
WITH CHICKEN.

08:28.533 --> 08:30.400
- YES! I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.633
NOW, LET'S GO.
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.767
WE'VE GOT A WELCOME BASKET
TO BUY.

08:42.433 --> 08:46.067
- ANOTHER FRESH BIG RONNIE PIE
JUST CAME OUT OF THE OVEN.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.167
YUMMY YUM YUMMERS!

08:48.200 --> 08:51.100
- OKAY, THAT IS CREEPY.
- I KNOW.

08:51.133 --> 08:54.533
IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE GRANDMA.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.433
- BUT IT HAS A MUSTACHE
AND SIDEBURNS.

08:57.467 --> 09:02.333
- YES.
YES, IT DOES.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.400
THERE'S THE RECIPE-STEALING
SNAKE.

09:06.433 --> 09:08.400
- OKAY, JUST REPEAT
EVERYTHING I SAY,

09:08.433 --> 09:09.800
AND WE'LL GET THAT BOOK BACK.

09:09.833 --> 09:11.567
- OKAY.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.100
- WELCOME TO BIG RONNIE'S.

09:14.133 --> 09:15.867
WILL IT BE JUST
THE TWO OF YOU GIRLS TODAY?

09:15.900 --> 09:17.633
- STOP THE CHARADE,
BIG RONNIE.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.500
WE KNOW YOU CAME OVER
DRESSED AS A WOMAN

09:19.533 --> 09:21.667
AND STOLE MY MOM'S RECIPES.
- YEAH.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.533
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

09:24.567 --> 09:28.200
THEN WHY ARE YOU
STILL WEARING EYELINER?

09:28.233 --> 09:30.233
- I'M ALSO IN A HEAVY METAL
BAND, SATAN'S CUPCAKE.

09:30.267 --> 09:32.233
MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF IT.
I PLAY POWER BASS.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.733
- OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

09:36.767 --> 09:37.867
TELL HIM ALL WILL BE FORGIVEN

09:37.900 --> 09:40.400
IF HE JUST RETURNS THE BOOK.

09:40.433 --> 09:43.133
- LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE US OUR RECIPES BACK,

09:43.167 --> 09:44.467
AND ALL WILL BE FORGIVEN.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.633
- GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.567
WALK WITH ME,
TALK WITH ME HERE, HUH?

09:50.600 --> 09:52.300
HEY, STEVE,
YOU ENJOYING THAT MUFFIN?

09:52.333 --> 09:54.867
YEAH, YOU ARE, HUH?
ALL RIGHT.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.300
- SEE, IT'S WORKING.
I KNEW HE WAS NICE.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.600
- ALL RIGHT, YOU LITTLE RUNTS,
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA GO.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.767
YOU SEE, WITH YOUR RECIPES
IN MY AUTOMATED BAKERY,

10:02.800 --> 10:05.567
I CAN MAKE COPIES OF YOUR PIES
AT HALF THE PRICE.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.600
TRANSLATION--YOU'LL BE
OUT OF BUSINESS IN A MONTH.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.400
ROCK AND ROLL!

10:15.133 --> 10:18.133
- MY MOM'S PUT EVERYTHING
INTO THAT BAKERY.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.667
DON'T YOU FEEL ANYTHING WHEN
YOU CHEAT HER OUT OF CUSTOMERS?

10:20.700 --> 10:22.100
WAIT...

10:22.133 --> 10:23.667
I DO FEEL SOMETHING...
- MM-HMM.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.633
- WEALTHY!

10:27.667 --> 10:30.267
AND ONCE YOUR MOM'S BANKRUPT,

10:30.300 --> 10:33.667
I'LL TEAR DOWN HER HOUSE
AND BUILD MY CORPORATE OFFICES.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.400
PHYLLIS, YOU'RE A ROCK STAR.
DON'T GO CHANGING.

10:41.067 --> 10:44.267
- FINE, RONNIE,
YOU WANNA PLAY THAT WAY?

10:44.300 --> 10:46.067
BEEF, YOU'RE UP.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.200
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

10:47.233 --> 10:49.100
- TAP OUT, BRO.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.633
MAJOR WINDSTORM COMING UP.

10:57.367 --> 11:00.533
- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
HURRICANE LOUIE,

11:00.567 --> 11:02.900
BUT INSTEAD,
IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL BREEZE.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.233
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS,

11:08.267 --> 11:11.567
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I'D GO HOME AND PACK MY BAGS.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.200
- DON'T WORRY.
I SAVED MY BEST FOR LAST.

11:14.233 --> 11:17.267
HERE COMES A LEVEL 10 SCARE.

11:19.633 --> 11:22.200
I'M A LIME AGAIN,
AREN'T I?

11:31.067 --> 11:32.633
MAN, THAT BIG RONNIE'S
A TOTAL JERK.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.100
SORRY FOR USING THE J-WORD,
BUT IT'S JUST HOW I FEEL.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.967
- OW!

11:37.067 --> 11:38.233
- HE STOLE MOM'S RECIPES,

11:38.267 --> 11:40.200
AND IS SELLING THE PIES
AT HALF PRICE.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.667
WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.567
- SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.567
- WELL, CLEARLY THAT SOMEONE
ISN'T GOING TO BE

11:47.600 --> 11:51.067
BOW TIE MAN
AND HIS SIDEKICK, LIME BOY.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.733
WE NEED A REAL GHOST...
RAY.

11:53.767 --> 11:56.667
- HEY, STUPID FLOPPY MAN,

11:56.700 --> 12:00.767
STOP FLIRTING WITH ME
AND DO YOUR JOB!

12:00.800 --> 12:03.400
- OH, MAN, MOM'S LOSING IT.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.600
I FEEL HORRIBLE.

12:05.633 --> 12:07.433
I HAVE TO TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED.

12:07.467 --> 12:11.200
SO, MOM, HOW YOU DOING?

12:11.233 --> 12:13.233
TOP OF THE WORLD.

12:13.267 --> 12:14.533
BIG RONNIE'S HAS A LINE
AROUND THE BLOCK,

12:14.567 --> 12:16.500
AND I JUST HAVE ONE CUSTOMER,

12:16.533 --> 12:19.567
CAPTAIN BIKE SHORTS.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.967
THREE HOURS AND ALL HE'S ORDERED
IS GREEN TEA.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.667
EAT A MUFFIN, TREVOR!

12:25.700 --> 12:28.300
WON'T KILL YA.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.567
- MOM, PLEASE TRY TO STAY CALM.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.367
- OH, I'M CALM.
CALM LIKE A FOX.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.100
I'VE GOT A BACKUP PLAN.

12:36.133 --> 12:38.233
THIS PLACE GOES BANKRUPT,
I'VE GOT OTHER SKILLS.

12:38.267 --> 12:39.700
WHEN I WENT TO SUMMER CAMP
AS A GIRL,

12:39.733 --> 12:41.300
I WON AN ARCHERY BADGE.

12:41.333 --> 12:44.400
I CAN HUNT FOR OUR DINNER.

12:44.433 --> 12:47.100
- OKAY, WELL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.400
MOM IS SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

12:53.433 --> 12:54.733
WE NEED RAY.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.433
- YOU DON'T NEED DAD.
YOU GOT ME.

12:56.467 --> 12:59.467
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT I GOT PLANNED NEXT.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.133
BIG RONNIE,
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE!

13:06.733 --> 13:08.800
- YES, DEAN SPECTER.

13:08.833 --> 13:11.267
I'LL TALK TO MILES.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.667
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE TURNED
HIMSELF INTO A RAINBOW

13:13.700 --> 13:16.167
DURING RECESS.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.400
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.400
- GET IN.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.600
- NO QUESTIONS.
JUST GET IN.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.967
- OKAY...

13:30.700 --> 13:33.500
- BIG RONNIE'S BAKERY IS
SELLING MOM'S PIES,

13:33.533 --> 13:35.600
AND WE MIGHT GO OUT OF BUSINESS.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.300
THANKS TO TAYLOR.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.667
- IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.433
AFTER HE CLOSES THE BUSINESS,

13:40.467 --> 13:42.667
HE'S PLANNING
TO TEAR DOWN THE HOUSE.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.367
WE NEED YOUR HELP, RAY.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.533
HE'S TRYING
TO TEAR DOWN MY HOUSE?

13:47.567 --> 13:50.600
- YES.
BECAUSE OF TAYLOR.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.733
- WE WANTED TO TELL MICHELLE,

13:52.767 --> 13:55.067
BUT SHE'S UNDER A TON
OF STRESS ALREADY.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.233
- MM, THAT'S TRUE.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.067
I SAW HER STRINGING UP
A BOW AND ARROW.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.533
SHE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
SHE'S IN A GOOD PLACE RIGHT NOW.

14:01.567 --> 14:02.800
I'M IN.

14:02.833 --> 14:05.667
- WHAT DO YOU
HAVE IN MIND, POPS?

14:05.700 --> 14:08.233
- I'M THINKING IT'S TIME
TO GET MY HAUNT ON,

14:08.267 --> 14:10.167
AND SCARE AWAY HIS CUSTOMERS.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.667
- OH, MY GOSH, RAY,

14:11.700 --> 14:14.233
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
YOU'D BE SAVING ME HERE.

14:14.267 --> 14:18.700
- SO, DAD, I'M GUESSING YOU
COULD USE A WINGMAN.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.533
- YOU KNOW IT!

14:20.567 --> 14:21.700
MILES, ARE YOU IN?

14:21.733 --> 14:23.367
- I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.267
I REALLY THINK HAUNTING SHOULD
BE A LAST RESORT.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.067
I WISH YOU WOULD
CHANGE YOUR MIND, SON.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.067
WE COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

14:30.067 --> 14:33.433
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO DO
WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

14:33.467 --> 14:36.467
ALL RIGHT, LOUIE,
LET'S GO HELP MICHELLE.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.733
- OH, YEAH!
DON'T THINK ABOUT LIMES.

14:38.767 --> 14:43.267
DON'T THINK ABOUT LIMES.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.200
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
BIG RONNIE'S FACE

14:48.233 --> 14:50.167
AS RAY DOES
HIS GHOST THING.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.600
- BIG RONNIE SAYS,

14:51.633 --> 14:54.233
"A PIE A DAY
KEEPS THE GRUMPIES AWAY!

14:54.267 --> 14:55.967
EAT MORE PIE!"

14:56.067 --> 14:59.067
- THAT THING'S MAKING ME
HATE GRANDMA.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.600
- AHH!

15:00.633 --> 15:04.133
EVERYONE'S WELCOME
AT BIG RONNIE'S.

15:04.167 --> 15:07.100
WHAT DO YOU
TWO LITTLE SNOTS WANT?

15:07.133 --> 15:09.067
- WE JUST CAME OVER
TO TELL YOU

15:09.067 --> 15:10.567
THAT WE'RE PUTTING
AN END TO THIS.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.667
ROCK AND ROLL!

15:13.700 --> 15:17.233
- DON'T DO THAT.

15:17.267 --> 15:21.333
SO, RONNIE, YOU READY TO MEET
OUR SECRET WEAPON?

15:21.367 --> 15:23.067
- AND BY "SECRET WEAPON,"

15:23.067 --> 15:25.400
DO YOU MEAN
YOUR LITTLE GHOST FRIENDS?

15:27.533 --> 15:30.167
- AH, COME ON, THE TALKING
TO INVISIBLE PEOPLE,

15:30.200 --> 15:31.533
THE FLOATING NAPKIN...

15:31.567 --> 15:32.967
IT WASN'T TOO HARD
TO FIGURE OUT.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.533
YOU HAVE GHOSTS.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.533
WHICH IS WHY I CALLED
MY SECRET WEAPON.

15:37.567 --> 15:40.067
MADAME...

15:44.500 --> 15:47.267
- IT IS I!

15:47.300 --> 15:49.967
IT IS ME?
IT IS...

15:50.067 --> 15:51.367
I'M HERE!

15:51.400 --> 15:52.967
- THAT'S THE WOMAN MOM HIRED

15:53.067 --> 15:54.500
TO GET RID OF MILES,
LOUIE, AND RAY

15:54.533 --> 15:57.333
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN.
- YES, FRANKIE, I WAS THERE.

15:57.367 --> 15:59.233
- HELLO, GIRLS.

15:59.267 --> 16:01.067
SORRY I HAD TO TAKE THIS GIG,

16:01.067 --> 16:03.500
BUT BIG RONNIE
PAYS TOP DOLLAR.

16:03.533 --> 16:06.567
AND MAMA NEEDS A HOT TUB.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.300
- YIPPIE-KI-YAY!
THE CAVALRY IS HERE.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.233
WHOA!

16:13.133 --> 16:15.100
- I'M SENSING TWO GHOSTS
JUST ENTERED THE BUILDING.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.067
WATCH ME WORK.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.967
EEE! AI-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI!

16:26.100 --> 16:28.400
- WHAT THE--
both: NO!

16:28.433 --> 16:31.567
- FREE AUTHENTIC CAJUN
PERFORMANCE ART,

16:31.600 --> 16:33.733
ONLY AT BIG RONNIE'S.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.567
YOU GET 'EM?
- HA!

16:36.600 --> 16:38.967
THE BOOM SHAKALAKA
NEVER FAILS.

16:39.067 --> 16:42.167
- HEY, LET OUR FRIENDS GO
OR ELSE!

16:48.533 --> 16:50.167
- THAT'S ALL I GOT.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.333
- ROGER THAT.
THIS IS HATHAWAY ONE,

16:54.367 --> 16:56.133
REQUESTING PERMISSION
FOR LIFTOFF.

16:59.367 --> 17:01.767
THIS IS EASY!
SEE?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.067
I TOLD YOU I COULD
MAKE A LIVING

17:03.067 --> 17:05.633
AS A HELICOPTER PILOT, TREVOR.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.767
UH-OH.
OH, UH-OH.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.267
I'M LOSING CONTROL.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.533
MAYDAY! MAYDAY!
WE'RE GOING DOWN!

17:26.167 --> 17:28.633
HELICOPTER PILOT.

17:28.667 --> 17:31.267
MAYBE.

17:36.733 --> 17:39.600
- LOUIE, YOUR ELBOW'S
RIGHT IN MY RIBS.

17:39.633 --> 17:42.367
- YOUR FOOT'S IN MY ARMPIT.
- GAH!

17:42.400 --> 17:44.567
- I'M GONNA GO CATCH A CAB.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.600
I GET THE STRANGEST LOOKS WHEN
I TAKE THIS THING ON THE BUS.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.533
- NO!

17:49.567 --> 17:52.267
IT'S BAD ENOUGH I RUINED
MY MOM'S BUSINESS.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.267
BUT YOU CAN'T GET RID
OF RAY AND LOUIE.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.467
THEY'RE FAMILY.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.067
- IT'S OVER, LADIES.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.067
BIG RONNIE WON.

17:59.067 --> 18:01.167
Miles: HA, I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE ABOUT THAT,

18:01.200 --> 18:03.667
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU MISSED A GHOST.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.467
WHO JUST SAID THAT?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.300
- I DID!

18:07.333 --> 18:09.233
THANKS FOR THE LIFT.

18:09.267 --> 18:11.467
- I'M SENSING ANOTHER GHOST.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.067
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HIDING IN A PERSON.

18:13.100 --> 18:16.400
I CAN'T DETECT THEM
WHEN THEY DO THAT.

18:16.433 --> 18:19.167
IT'S ON MY WEBSITE.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.233
- I'LL BE TAKING THAT.
- NO!

18:21.267 --> 18:24.167
- GIVE IT TO ME!

18:28.367 --> 18:31.267
- WHOO!

18:31.300 --> 18:33.367
- UH, WH--WH--
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS, UH...

18:33.400 --> 18:36.067
I'M OUT OF HERE.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.733
- STEP BACK, EVERYONE.

18:38.767 --> 18:40.967
IT'S SHOWTIME!
WOW!

18:45.067 --> 18:48.967
THIS BAKERY IS
FILLED WITH EVIL AND GREED!

18:49.067 --> 18:50.233
SORRY.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.967
IT'S REALLY NOT
NECESSARY TO RUN.

18:52.067 --> 18:55.567
PLEASE EXIT IN
AN ORDERLY FASHION.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.967
OH, MA'AM,
DON'T FORGET YOUR PURSE.

18:57.067 --> 19:00.267
YOU, YEAH.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.500
AS FOR YOU!

19:04.733 --> 19:08.467
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA HURT ME,
ARE YOU, MR. MUFFIN MAN?

19:08.500 --> 19:10.633
- THAT DEPENDS.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.133
DO YOU PROMISE TO LEAVE TOWN

19:12.167 --> 19:14.467
AND NEVER SERVE
A SQUARE PIE AGAIN?

19:14.500 --> 19:16.300
- I PROMISE.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.700
- AND AN APOLOGY TO MY FAMILY.

19:17.733 --> 19:19.700
- YEAH, YEAH.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.667
I'M SORRY.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.700
I'M A BAD, BAD MAN.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.233
- YOU MAY GO NOW.
- OKAY.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.500
- AAH!

19:31.533 --> 19:34.333
- IT'S PUSH, NOT PULL.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.733
- WOW, MILES.
THAT WAS AMAZING.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.133
- YEAH, THAT WAS!
THAT WAS MY BROTHER RIGHT THERE.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.533
- SON, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

19:49.567 --> 19:51.067
- I STILL DON'T
LIKE HAUNTING,

19:51.067 --> 19:53.800
BUT NOTHING COMES
BEFORE FAMILY.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.300
- WE SHOULD GET
BACK TO THE BAKERY,

19:55.333 --> 19:57.200
AND LET MOM KNOW
SHE CAN KEEP HER DAY JOB.

19:57.233 --> 20:00.033
GOOD IDEA.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.567
- TUESDAYS ARE
ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT PIE DAYS.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.633
EAT! EAT!
YOU'RE TOO THIN!

20:05.667 --> 20:08.767
- IT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE GRANDMA.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.733
- MOM, SORRY ABOUT
LOSING YOUR RECIPES.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.400
I WANTED TO TELL YOU, BUT...

20:17.433 --> 20:19.333
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D BE
SO DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.133
I PROMISE TO
PAY BETTER ATTENTION

20:21.167 --> 20:22.300
TO WHAT I'M DOING FROM NOW ON.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.467
- HMM.
- THANKS.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.600
THANK YOU.

20:27.633 --> 20:30.067
AND I NEVER WANT YOU TO FEEL
LIKE YOU CAN'T COME TO ME

20:30.100 --> 20:31.400
WHEN YOU'VE DONE
SOMETHING WRONG.

20:31.433 --> 20:32.600
- THANKS, MOM,
I LOVE YOU.

20:32.633 --> 20:35.000
- AW, I LOVE YOU, TOO.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.733
NOW GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
YOU'VE LOST IT FOR A WEEK.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.500
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

20:38.533 --> 20:39.600
- AW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
A MONTH.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.733
- OKAY, A WEEK.

20:41.767 --> 20:43.667
- THANK YOU.
- HMM.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.233
- WAIT.

20:47.267 --> 20:49.667
- MILES, I WAS
VERY PROUD OF YOU TODAY.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.500
- BECAUSE I FINALLY HAUNTED
SOMEBODY?

20:51.533 --> 20:54.000
- NO, I WASN'T PROUD
BECAUSE YOU HAUNTED.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.100
I WAS PROUD BECAUSE
YOU DID IT FOR YOUR FAMILY.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.333
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
TRYING SO HARD

20:58.367 --> 21:00.133
TO TEACH YOU
TO BE A BETTER GHOST,

21:00.167 --> 21:02.067
I FORGOT
WHAT A GREAT SON YOU ARE.

21:02.067 --> 21:05.100
- THANKS, DAD.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.800
WANNA SEE ME TURN MYSELF
INTO A RAINBOW?

21:06.833 --> 21:09.633
- SURE, SON.
SURE.

21:21.733 --> 21:23.667
I'M EXHAUSTED.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.633
BUT IT'S NICE TO SEE EVERYTHING
BACK TO NORMAL AGAIN.

21:25.667 --> 21:29.133
- HMM, ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT BACK TO NORMAL YET.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.133
OKAY, NOW IT'S BACK TO NORMAL.
