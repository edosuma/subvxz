<i>Sue, don't misunderstand
me, please.</i>

00:40.123 --> 00:41.832
Sue, I'm not complaining
about your work.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.960
I have your latest piece
right here in front of me

00:43.961 --> 00:45.753
and it's terrific, it's great.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.948
It's just that you were
due back here yesterday.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.467
Yeah, but Richard, there's one
more story I just have to do.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.052
<i>There's always one more story.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:55.121
No, but would you listen to this?

00:55.806 --> 00:58.000
Last month this guy in
the Northern Territory

00:58.016 --> 00:59.809
was attacked by a crocodile.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.477
The thing bit his leg right off,

01:01.478 --> 01:04.081
left him there to die
100 miles from nowhere.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.732
A week later, he crawls
out of the bush,

01:06.733 --> 01:08.380
gets patched up and disappears.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.444
<i>No interviews,
no pictures, nothing.</i>

01:10.445 --> 01:12.388
- So?
<i>- I tracked him down.</i>

01:12.739 --> 01:16.727
He runs a safari business out of
somewhere called Walkabout Creek.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.179
<i>And his name...</i>

01:19.580 --> 01:20.681
<i>Get this...</i>

01:21.832 --> 01:24.310
Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.877
Sue, even if this
thing is for real,

01:26.878 --> 01:28.776
it could take you weeks
to nail him down.

01:28.839 --> 01:29.986
<i>Will you trust me?</i>

01:30.173 --> 01:31.966
I already made
arrangements to meet him.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.801
I've got a chopper meeting
the plane at Darwin.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.119
I'll be there tonight.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.743
Well...

01:38.432 --> 01:39.749
Okay.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.268
I really miss you, darling.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.461
<i>I miss you, too, honey.</i>

01:43.478 --> 01:44.520
<i>Take care now.</i>

01:44.521 --> 01:46.373
Don't worry. I'm a New Yorker.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.359
Hi.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.450
Walter Reilly, Never Never Safaris.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.847
I'm Mr. Dundee's business partner.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.140
Nice to meet you, Mr. Reilly.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.434
Oh, please, call me Walter.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.629
We're pretty informal in the bush.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.928
No, uh, let me.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.302
There you go.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.308
- You all right?
- Yes.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.630
I'm sorry that Mr. Dundee isn't
here himself to meet you.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.781
But he is here in town. Somewhere.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.147
Welcome to Walkabout Creek.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.079
Hmm.

05:05.764 --> 05:10.017
Oh, I took the liberty of
booking you into our hotel.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.811
I trust that's in order?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.334
Sounds just fine.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.461
There's just one other thing.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.607
Uh...

05:16.608 --> 05:21.339
You did say that you were
prepared to pay the $2,500?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.006
Absolutely.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.518
And I will see where he was
attacked and how he survived?

05:27.160 --> 05:31.140
Miss, I assure you, you're gonna
spend a few wonderful days here.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.084
Come on, fellas. Five bucks,
anyone who can make Donk spill it.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.758
So tell me, what's the
sideshow all about?

06:00.235 --> 06:02.194
Oh, that's just the boys
having fun and games.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.696
You see, Donk's never
spilled a drop.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.677
- We're a pretty tough breed up here.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.266
Ooh!

06:11.121 --> 06:12.788
And your Mr. Dundee, does he...

06:12.789 --> 06:14.937
No, no, no. No, no,
he's very reserved.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.231
He's a legend up here.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.671
I mean, there he was out there
doing a quiet spot of fishing,

06:20.672 --> 06:22.615
when all of a sudden... Bang!

06:23.008 --> 06:25.110
This giant crocodile came up,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.738
turned him over, bit
half his leg off,

06:28.638 --> 06:30.331
dragged him down under.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.035
Killed it, of course.

06:33.184 --> 06:38.882
I mean, any normal man would have
just turned up his toes and died.

06:40.066 --> 06:44.137
But not our Mick.  No.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.803
Hundreds of miles...

06:47.490 --> 06:50.059
Snake-infested swamps...

06:51.119 --> 06:53.392
On his hands and knees...

06:54.497 --> 06:57.316
He crawled right into Katherine.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.209
Straight past the hospital

06:59.210 --> 07:02.109
and into the first pub for a beer.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.993
That story's getting better
every time you tell it, Wally.

07:12.182 --> 07:16.457
No, we handle ourselves pretty
well up here in the bush, Miss.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.497
But if you're talking legend...

07:29.699 --> 07:31.051
Oh, my God!

07:44.714 --> 07:46.340
Two beers, Ida.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.409
One for me, one for me mate.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.071
"One for your mate,"
you mad bugger.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.080
Oh, hang on.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.504
I'm sorry if that
frightened you, Miss.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.165
You see, it's stuffed.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.794
Him and me both, Wal.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.937
Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.349
Never Never Safaris.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.360
Yeah. Um, never go outwith us,

08:22.711 --> 08:25.189
if you do, you'll never
come back. Right, Wal?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.028
Sue Charlton, <i>Newsday</i>.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.533
Yeah, I thought you might be.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.933
Uh, here, Wal. Mind Cyril for me

08:38.934 --> 08:43.164
while I dance with this
charming young lady.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.232
Legend has it a crocodile
took half your leg off.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.959
Uh, well, a slight exaggeration.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.312
Um...

09:05.420 --> 09:07.238
More like a love bite, really.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.327
Anyhow, enough about me leg.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.780
Let me tell you about
the rest of me.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.809
Up north in the Never Never, where
the land is harsh and bare,

09:20.810 --> 09:23.604
lives a mighty hunter
named Mick Dundee,

09:23.605 --> 09:25.878
who can dance like Fred Astaire.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.542
Smooth shag, eh?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.652
What did you say the
name of this clown was?

09:30.653 --> 09:31.845
Mick Dundee.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.638
He's the bloke that was grabbed
by a croc on the Rapid River.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.181
What was he doing up there?

09:37.535 --> 09:40.855
It's full of crocs. What do
you reckon he was doing?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.937
Just a bloody poacher, eh?

09:44.125 --> 09:45.667
Listen, you do understand

09:45.668 --> 09:47.941
I want you to take me out
where you were attacked,

09:48.671 --> 09:50.444
show me how you survived.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.675
Oh, well, I don't know, just
the two of us out there alone?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.296
I've got me reputation
to think about.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.830
Hey, Dundee.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.891
Where can a man shoot a few
crocs around here, eh?

10:05.855 --> 10:09.084
How would I know, shit-for-brains?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.175
Just relax.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.282
Now, come on, Dundee.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.118
Every man and his dog
in the joint knows

10:19.119 --> 10:21.517
you're nothing but a
bloody croc poacher.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.077
You better get your
men out of here.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.592
Oh, sorry about that.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.663
But I won't have anyone using bad
language in front of a lady.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.498
Bad language?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.665
Don't come back neither!

10:45.019 --> 10:47.338
What was he saying about
you being a poacher?

10:47.730 --> 10:51.050
Uh, he was just trying to
get a bite, that's all.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.509
Donk, tonight's me lucky night.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.280
You want to have a hit at the guts?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.073
Here's a go, fellas.
Good on you, Mick.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.973
Come on, guys, put
your money on me.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.071
Come on, Mick.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.747
Give me a kiss, Donk.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.303
I'm sorry. He's not
normally like this.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.135
I do apologize.
It's just the drink.

11:38.656 --> 11:41.350
You mean there's a serious
side to him? Hmm.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.304
I can hardly wait.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.637
Uh, comfortable, Miss?

12:01.638 --> 12:03.222
Wonderful country out here.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.745
We think so.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.403
Well, I hope you're not gonna
be the strong, silent type.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.506
- Me?
- Reluctant to talk about yourself?

12:20.531 --> 12:22.324
No. Favorite subject.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.018
Great. Why "Crocodile"?

12:24.619 --> 12:25.971
Wal's idea.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.814
He reckons it makes me more
colorful for the tourist business.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.980
How old are you?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.421
Don't know.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.839
Uh, what year is this?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.132
You don't know?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.885
Um, time doesn't mean
much up here, Miss.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.930
You see, um, the Aborigines
don't have calendars.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.182
I was raised by the local tribe.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.935
I asked one of the tribal
elders one day when I was born.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.380
And he said, "In the summertime."

13:12.375 --> 13:14.352
And is there a
Mrs. Crocodile Dundee?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.629
I was sort of married once.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.483
- Nice girl. Good cook. Big...
- Mick!

13:24.345 --> 13:27.073
Anyway, I went off on walkabout.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.041
When I came back, she'd gone.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.752
A walkabout?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.270
That's an Aboriginal habit.

13:33.271 --> 13:38.421
It means to, uh, wander around
and discover new places.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.295
How long were you gone?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.009
Couple months.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.388
Try 18.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.809
And she didn't wait?

13:47.076 --> 13:48.302
Strange girl.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.189
Yeah.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.618
Out of the way, dopey!

15:05.029 --> 15:06.631
Jesus...

15:10.118 --> 15:11.936
That was amazing.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.222
Mind over matter.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.974
Old bushman's trick.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.708
All right, Miss. All ashore.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.401
Now, I'm going to leave you
in Mick's capable hands,

16:26.402 --> 16:29.676
and I'll meet you at the Echo
Billabong on Wednesday.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.699
2:20. We better get started.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.634
2:20.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.238
Yeah. Yes. That's the way
that we do it in the bush.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.472
Uh, don't you worry, Miss.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.167
He's the best bushman
in the territory.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.544
Best pupil I ever had.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.542
You ready, lady?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.502
Ready as I'll ever be.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.484
Right, well, uh, till Wednesday.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.213
- Cheerio.
- Wednesday.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.060
- What's today, Wal?
- Monday.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.227
Doesn't know.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.028
Doesn't care.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.277
Lucky bastard.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.245
- You okay, lady?
- Oh, I'm fine.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.176
It's only about another
hour to the river,

17:48.776 --> 17:50.719
but you being a sheila,

17:51.070 --> 17:52.672
it'll probably take two.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.092
Well, I'll just do the best I can.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.765
Yeah.

18:03.124 --> 18:06.352
The water was running 20 foot up
the bank during the wet season.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.290
Here's what's left of me boat.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.613
Now you can see where
he sunk his teeth in.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.182
My God.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.638
How big was it?

18:39.076 --> 18:41.599
Uh, 16, 18 foot, maybe.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.809
And you were out here
hunting crocodiles in that?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.688
Nah, that's illegal.
I was just fishing.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.988
How did you get away?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.930
Uh, see, crocs don't
like fresh meat.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.749
He wasn't trying to
eat me on the spot.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.935
He just wanted grab hold of me and
take me down for a death roll.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.128
A death roll?

19:07.271 --> 19:10.215
Yeah. See, a croc will grab you,

19:10.816 --> 19:12.668
take you down to the
bottom of the water,

19:12.735 --> 19:15.714
and roll you over and over and
over till you stop kicking.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.683
Then he'll take you away to
his meat safe somewhere.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.019
A rock ledge, log,

19:22.370 --> 19:25.106
down under the water and
jam you under it...

19:25.331 --> 19:26.665
Tenderize you a bit.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.938
Good eating.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.254
Anyway, he wasn't happy
with the grip he had on me,

19:33.255 --> 19:36.362
so he let go to get a better
one, and I talked him out of it.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.909
Talked?

19:49.772 --> 19:51.419
And you were just out here fishing?

19:54.151 --> 19:57.596
Well, a barramundi's
a bloody big fish.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.721
It'll be getting dark soon.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.852
I'll take you to where I
camped the first night.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.350
You married?

20:27.351 --> 20:28.623
Was once...

20:29.812 --> 20:31.289
To the original rebel.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.415
What happened?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.002
You name it, we marched...

20:36.277 --> 20:38.926
Anti-nuke, women's lib,
save the whales.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.824
He's probably marching right now
for the gay Nazis or something.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.927
Hmm. Sounds like a prize ratbag.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.013
Oh, he meant well.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.106
Haven't you ever
protested anything?

20:50.541 --> 20:52.894
Sure. Every time I get
thrown out of the pub.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.024
Come on, I'm serious.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.339
I mean, where would someone
like you stand on,

20:58.340 --> 21:00.008
say, the nuclear debate?

21:00.009 --> 21:01.827
What do you think
about the arms race?

21:01.969 --> 21:03.366
None of my business.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.786
None of your business?

21:06.015 --> 21:07.367
How can you say that?

21:07.516 --> 21:09.289
It's everybody's business.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.793
Got to have an opinion.
Got to have a voice.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.466
Who's going to hear it out here?

21:21.155 --> 21:22.507
Okay.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.282
Something closer to home.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.227
Uh... The Aborigines.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.806
What do you think about their
claims to get the land back?

21:31.707 --> 21:33.309
Ah, well, you see,

21:33.542 --> 21:35.485
Aborigines don't own the land.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.775
They belong to it.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.573
It's like their mother.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.782
See those rocks sticking up there?

21:44.512 --> 21:47.161
Been standing up there
for 600 million years.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.996
Still be there when
you and I are gone.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.628
So arguing over who owns them

21:54.730 --> 21:59.051
is like two fleas arguing over
who owns the dog they live on.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.570
You see, uh...

22:02.571 --> 22:03.822
Uh...

22:03.823 --> 22:06.074
Aborigines, well, like
all God's creatures,

22:06.075 --> 22:07.848
they just want the right to

22:08.327 --> 22:10.555
roam across the earth
and be left in peace.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.857
It's that...

22:22.591 --> 22:23.863
Oh, it's a king brown.

22:24.635 --> 22:25.952
Poisonous?

22:26.136 --> 22:27.579
Oh, yeah. Deadly.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.915
Not bad eating,
but always give me gas.

22:31.392 --> 22:34.541
Uh, listen, are there any
more of those around?

22:36.021 --> 22:38.606
Oh, maybe the odd
one late at night.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.880
But stick close to me,
you'll be all right.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.467
Yeah, you're probably right, a
man should have an opinion.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.912
- I... Shh!
- What?

23:11.307 --> 23:13.125
Hmm. Thought I heard something.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.435
No, it's nothing.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.913
Good night.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.590
Mick?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.647
It's only me.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.025
Dangerous bastards.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.694
It's those city cowboys.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.993
What are you going to do?

24:31.053 --> 24:32.428
Nothing. Why?

24:32.429 --> 24:35.874
Why? They're shooting these
poor kangaroos for fun.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.713
There's no law against that.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.637
Keep your head down.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.177
Stay here.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.974
Hey. Ah, I need a piss.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.545
I need a piss!

25:05.546 --> 25:07.398
Yeah, and a straighter rifle.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.192
You're as useless as
tits on a bull, Duffy!

25:14.847 --> 25:17.265
Shh! Shut up, you guys.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.367
- Hey, Trevor.
- What?

25:18.434 --> 25:20.268
Trevor, get the spotlight
over here, mate.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.246
- Eh?
- The spotlight!

25:22.980 --> 25:24.480
Can't you see where you're aiming?

25:24.481 --> 25:25.833
Shut up!

25:29.445 --> 25:33.300
Not on me, you silly
bugger, on the bushes.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.096
Hey...

25:35.159 --> 25:37.307
Hey, look at this
big cheeky bugger.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.061
Hey! It's got a gun!

25:45.919 --> 25:47.566
Shit!

25:49.131 --> 25:51.074
Get out of here! Get going!

26:07.649 --> 26:09.547
Whoo-hoo!

26:10.736 --> 26:12.213
Good one, skippy.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.153
Despite the rugged
beauty of this land,

27:14.508 --> 27:17.260
there's a sort of strange
emptiness about it.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.160
A feeling of being so alone.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.159
Yeah, but you're not alone.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.493
I'm here, aren't I?

27:26.353 --> 27:27.921
Yeah, but...

27:28.105 --> 27:30.022
I think I know how you
must have felt...

27:30.023 --> 27:33.593
Or how I'd feel if I
were out here alone.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.921
You... Out here alone?

27:36.029 --> 27:37.381
That's a joke.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.675
A city girl like you...

27:40.409 --> 27:42.118
You wouldn't last
five minutes, love.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.846
This is man's country out here.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.901
That's right. I'm only a sheila.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.039
We're heading for that
escarpment today, right?

28:03.098 --> 28:04.450
Yeah.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.414
Okay.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.128
See you there this afternoon.

28:09.605 --> 28:10.877
Hey!

28:12.858 --> 28:14.926
If you're gonna go,
take the gun with you.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.804
If you get into trouble, fire
a couple of shots in the air.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.064
That's the dangerous end.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.915
So it is.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.133
Hmm.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.800
It's all right. It's over.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.015
Hey. Hey.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.471
I got you. I got you.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.653
Is it dead?

32:57.058 --> 32:59.059
Well, if it isn't, I'm gonna
have a hell of a job

32:59.060 --> 33:00.582
skinning the bastard.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.011
Well, you were right.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.871
Definitely no place
for a city girl.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.349
Ah, I don't know.

33:20.499 --> 33:24.585
From what Wal's told me, living in
the city can be just as dangerous.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.609
Haven't you ever lived in a city?

33:26.880 --> 33:28.357
Never been to a city.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.033
- You're kidding.
- No.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.243
Cities are crowded, right?

33:32.719 --> 33:35.826
If I went and lived in some
city, I'd only make it worse.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.870
Here. Try this.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.773
Do you want me to
have a look at that?

33:45.774 --> 33:46.982
It's just a scratch.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.901
Yeah, well, a scratch can
turn septic out here.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.800
Give us a look. It's all right.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.391
Shh.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.059
Now what?

34:02.165 --> 34:04.734
Oh, Christ. It's like
living with Davy Crockett.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.609
Mick?

34:17.597 --> 34:18.789
Mick.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.820
Ah, Mick.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.487
You frightened shit out of me.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.574
So I ought to, mate.
Sneaking up on a man

34:36.574 --> 34:38.928
when he's rendering
first-aid to a lady.

34:39.286 --> 34:42.060
Ah. Is that what you were doing?

34:46.126 --> 34:47.167
It's all right.
It's a mate of mine.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.020
Neville Bell. Sue Charlton.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.563
G'day, Sue.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.987
What are you doing wandering
around here in the scrub, Nev?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.790
I'm on my way to a corroboree
over at the Jabba.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.324
It's a bloody drag,

35:01.850 --> 35:04.669
but still my dad get angry
if I don't show up.

35:05.562 --> 35:09.670
See, Nev's a real city boy,
but his dad's a tribal elder.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.132
Oh, no. You can't
take my photograph.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.473
Oh. I'm sorry. You believe it
will take your spirit away.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.593
No. You got lens cap on.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.316
Crikey, Mick. I better get going.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.988
- Nice to meet you, Sue.
- Bye, Nev.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.690
I'll catch up with you, Nev.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.825
What's happening?

35:37.427 --> 35:39.871
I better go with Nev and have
a chat with the Pintinjarra.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.160
Oh, can I come?

35:41.556 --> 35:42.931
No way.

35:42.932 --> 35:45.251
Women are strictly taboo
at these turnouts.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.131
How does he find his
way in the dark?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.001
He thinks his way.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.388
A lot of people believe
that they're telepathic.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.218
Ooh!

35:58.698 --> 36:00.391
Oh, I hate the bush.

37:28.455 --> 37:29.602
How did you know?

37:34.627 --> 37:35.944
Are you telepathic?

37:38.548 --> 37:40.616
Nah. Common sense.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.328
You're a woman. You're a reporter.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.997
That makes you the biggest
busybody in the world.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.288
I can live with that.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.166
That croc was gonna eat me alive.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.262
Oh, I wouldn't hold
that against him.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.595
Same thought crossed
my mind once or twice.

38:11.831 --> 38:12.978
Good night, Mick.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.101
Hmm.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.314
Of course, it took me a
week to crawl this far.

38:20.089 --> 38:21.799
I thought I was a goner.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.119
Said to meself, "Mick, old son",

38:24.219 --> 38:26.242
"find yourself a nice,
comfortable spot"

38:26.638 --> 38:28.160
"and lay down and die."

38:28.181 --> 38:29.498
Weren't you afraid?

38:29.557 --> 38:31.034
Of dying? Nah.

38:31.226 --> 38:32.828
I read the Bible once.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.880
You know God and Jesus
and all them apostles?

38:36.648 --> 38:39.092
They were all fishermen,
just like me.

38:39.609 --> 38:42.178
Yep. Straight to heaven
for Mick Dundee.

38:45.406 --> 38:46.632
Yep.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.181
Me and God...

38:49.744 --> 38:50.936
We'd be mates.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.572
This is Echo Lake.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.329
I reckon this place saved me life.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.434
That's mineral water.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.912
Means no crocs.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.540
More tucker here than you
could poke a stick at.

39:18.565 --> 39:19.757
Tucker?

39:20.400 --> 39:21.843
Food. You hungry?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.383
- Starving.
- I'll get lunch.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.104
How do you like your goanna?
Medium? Well done?

39:37.792 --> 39:39.565
You don't really
expect me to eat that?

39:39.627 --> 39:42.105
Yeah, it's great. Here,
try some of those yams.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.403
Try the grubs and the sugar ants.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.383
Just bite the end off.
They're really sweet.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.031
Black fellas love them.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.834
What about you?
Aren't you having any?

39:54.934 --> 39:56.081
Me?

39:57.312 --> 39:58.584
Ah, Well...

39:58.646 --> 40:00.214
You can live on it...

40:01.149 --> 40:02.592
But it tastes like shit.

41:14.514 --> 41:15.831
Mick.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.958
When I go back, why
don't you come with me?

41:18.226 --> 41:19.418
What for?

41:20.853 --> 41:23.581
Well, it would make a great
wrap to the story...

41:23.898 --> 41:25.841
You in New York City.

41:27.694 --> 41:28.886
Oh.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.947
For a minute there I thought
you were making a pass at me.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.675
Well, I might have been.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.397
Would you mind?

42:06.649 --> 42:07.966
Bloody Wally.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.360
He's only been here a dozen times.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.929
He's probably lost.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.406
Did you, uh...

42:35.678 --> 42:37.405
You got wind or something, Wal?

42:46.147 --> 42:48.670
I want Mick to come back
to New York with me.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.884
Mick? In a big city?

42:51.152 --> 42:52.504
No chance.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.384
Paper would pay.

42:55.740 --> 43:00.220
Well, a man should
broaden his horizons.

43:07.168 --> 43:08.645
Everything Okay?

43:09.128 --> 43:11.276
Oh, yeah. No worries.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.422
Jesus Christ!

43:57.927 --> 43:59.074
Sue!

44:00.680 --> 44:01.781
Sue!

44:02.390 --> 44:03.537
Sue.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.293
G'day, mate!

44:09.647 --> 44:12.375
You look absolutely stunning.

44:16.112 --> 44:17.509
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.719
Here, let me get this.

44:20.575 --> 44:21.847
Oh...

44:22.577 --> 44:24.411
Where's the man from the backwoods?

44:24.412 --> 44:27.080
Oh, God. We got
separated in customs.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.248
He almost started a riot

44:28.249 --> 44:30.317
when they wanted to look
through his suitcase.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.857
Ah, there he is.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.153
So, that's Jungle Jim.

45:09.624 --> 45:11.271
New York City, Mr. Dundee.

45:11.459 --> 45:13.561
Home to seven million people.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.045
That's incredible.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.737
Imagine seven million people
all wanting to live together.

45:19.717 --> 45:22.616
Yep. New York must be the
friendliest place on earth.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.176
G'day!

45:41.280 --> 45:43.382
Mick Dundee from
Australia. How are you?

45:43.950 --> 45:45.427
I'm fine. How are you? I think...

45:45.910 --> 45:49.059
Good. Just came down
for a couple of days.

45:49.288 --> 45:50.435
Probably see you around.

45:51.707 --> 45:53.434
Fine. We went from there...

45:54.835 --> 45:56.278
I don't know, I think...

46:16.565 --> 46:18.258
Thank you, Gus.

46:22.029 --> 46:24.928
- You'll take care of the luggage?
- Yes, sir.

46:29.537 --> 46:30.934
That's it.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.750
Hey. Thanks for the lift, mate.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.148
No problem.

46:37.211 --> 46:38.312
What tribe are you, Gus?

46:38.629 --> 46:39.946
Tribe?

46:40.881 --> 46:42.233
Man, I ain't from no tribe.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.802
You're a black feller, aren't you?

46:44.552 --> 46:46.029
Last time I looked.

46:48.097 --> 46:50.575
No one in our tribe's got
a flash car like this.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.456
You must be doing all right, eh?

46:58.941 --> 47:00.964
I'll get a cab back to the office.

47:01.110 --> 47:02.819
Do you want to eat
somewhere special tonight?

47:02.820 --> 47:04.718
Well, I thought
Tucano's would be nice.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.448
Tucano's. 7:30?

47:06.449 --> 47:07.846
Mmm. Great.

47:08.659 --> 47:09.851
- Bye.
- Okay.

47:09.869 --> 47:11.346
Table for three.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.339
Sir?

47:45.363 --> 47:46.885
No worries.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.823
Well, what do you think?

48:06.133 --> 48:08.327
Oh, it's a bit rough,
but I'll manage.

48:10.096 --> 48:12.574
Hey, how many of us
are staying here?

48:12.973 --> 48:14.950
Just you.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.077
I've got my own apartment downtown.

48:27.822 --> 48:30.990
Oh, sorry, Mick Dundee.
I didn't catch the name.

48:30.991 --> 48:33.560
- Angelo.
- Pleased to meet you, Angelo.

48:33.577 --> 48:36.851
I got it. Here you go.

48:40.918 --> 48:43.112
Got to pay for the room
in advance, have we?

48:43.421 --> 48:45.319
You're in m town now, trust me.

48:50.052 --> 48:53.998
Yeah. Can I get the direct
dialing code for Australia?

49:01.856 --> 49:03.958
You should be comfortable.
Everything's here.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.543
There's a TV if you get bored.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.128
Ah, television.

49:08.237 --> 49:10.965
Yeah, I saw that at Darkie
Johnson's place years ago.

49:17.788 --> 49:20.266
Yep, that's what I saw.

49:23.544 --> 49:26.147
Right. Okay, thanks.

49:27.506 --> 49:31.759
So, I'm writing down Wally's
number and my office number.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.329
Hey, Sue, come here, look at this!

49:40.769 --> 49:42.963
Some nitwit's put two
dunnies in here.

49:43.898 --> 49:46.000
One dunny, one bidet.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.298
- Bidet?
- Mmm.

49:49.653 --> 49:54.099
It's for... After you... You know.

49:58.204 --> 49:59.851
You figure it out.

50:01.707 --> 50:03.150
See you at seven.

50:03.626 --> 50:04.727
Yeah.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.565
For washing your backside, right?

51:02.810 --> 51:04.082
G'day.

51:18.284 --> 51:19.556
G'day.

51:20.703 --> 51:21.975
G'day.

51:31.547 --> 51:33.069
- Hello.
- G'day.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.571
G'day.

51:54.403 --> 51:55.675
Sorry.

51:58.741 --> 52:00.263
G'day. Ooops!

52:02.453 --> 52:03.645
Shit.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.883
- Take it easy, Mick.
- Thanks, mate.

53:15.484 --> 53:16.836
- Ta.
- Bye.

53:18.779 --> 53:20.847
- G'day.
- Yes, sir.

53:34.670 --> 53:37.319
Good evening. Follow me, please.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.112
- Hello.
- Um.

53:43.804 --> 53:45.747
Sorry we're late.

53:45.764 --> 53:48.492
- Been waiting long?
- Oh, I arrived early,

53:48.809 --> 53:51.018
eager to spend time with my girl.

53:51.019 --> 53:54.230
So, what are we drinking?
Uh, two vodka martinis,

53:54.231 --> 53:56.107
and what's yours, crocodile?

53:56.108 --> 53:58.757
Yeah, I'll have two of
those, and a beer, thanks.

53:59.695 --> 54:02.048
Could you send them through
to our table, Matt?

54:07.411 --> 54:09.513
You have been here awhile.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.690
Let's eat.

54:14.001 --> 54:15.960
Now this will be quite a
novelty for you, Mick.

54:15.961 --> 54:19.782
Eating something without
having to kill it first.

54:20.507 --> 54:21.859
Shall we?

54:22.843 --> 54:25.261
- Ah, Roberto.
- Good evening, Mr. Mason.

54:25.262 --> 54:28.536
I can see you got some
friends. Follow me, please.

54:34.354 --> 54:35.797
Thank you.

54:43.363 --> 54:47.434
You know I had almost forgotten
what a sexy-looking lady you are.

54:47.993 --> 54:50.036
I'll gonna have to find a
way of keeping you in town.

54:50.037 --> 54:51.871
Oh, I think we can
work something out.

54:51.872 --> 54:53.098
Really? Yes, what?

54:56.126 --> 54:58.820
Listen, uh, you two
should really be alone.

54:59.087 --> 55:02.191
Sorry, Mick. It's just that we haven't
seen each other in six weeks.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.758
Well, that's all the more reason...

55:03.759 --> 55:06.928
Oh, there's no way I'd leave you alone
on your first night in New York.

55:06.929 --> 55:09.282
Richard and I want you with us.

55:09.598 --> 55:11.371
Right. Absolutely.

55:11.850 --> 55:15.500
Ah, New York is no place
for a country gent.

55:17.064 --> 55:20.691
I mean, ain't no crocodiles out
there, but a fast-moving Chevy

55:20.692 --> 55:23.341
sure make a mess of you.

55:30.077 --> 55:31.804
What's your game?

55:34.122 --> 55:35.873
Great. I'm starving.

55:35.874 --> 55:38.102
Ha ha! <i>Grazie</i>, Roberto.

55:46.969 --> 55:51.199
Thank you. Um, perhaps I should
order for all of us, right?

55:52.015 --> 55:54.600
I mean, I don't imagine
that they have any...

55:54.601 --> 55:56.703
Kangaroo steak or possum grits!

55:57.104 --> 55:59.188
Oh, don't worry about Mick.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.066
He can make a gourmet meal
out of just about anything.

56:02.067 --> 56:04.044
Even medium-rare goanna.

56:04.820 --> 56:07.113
It was great, wasn't it, eh?
And what about the yams?

56:07.114 --> 56:09.808
Oh, yes. They were great.

56:11.618 --> 56:13.265
Well, that's...

56:14.580 --> 56:16.307
That's wonderful.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.898
As he's our guest,

56:20.294 --> 56:22.044
perhaps he'd like to
order for all of us.

56:22.045 --> 56:24.443
Oh, wait a minute. I'll do that.

56:25.632 --> 56:27.826
No, it's... It's all right.

56:27.926 --> 56:29.653
I'll have a lash.

56:34.474 --> 56:36.576
- Italian, eh?
- Yes.

56:45.736 --> 56:48.237
I don't know what you call it,
but I'd like to look at that dish

56:48.238 --> 56:50.306
out there the big fat
sheila's eating.

56:55.162 --> 56:56.514
Richard!

56:57.831 --> 56:59.103
He okay?

57:00.042 --> 57:02.110
Can't handle his drink, poor fella.

57:14.848 --> 57:16.515
He said you hit him.

57:16.516 --> 57:19.352
You're not in the pub
at Walkabout Creek now.

57:19.353 --> 57:22.377
- He was being a pain.
- That's beside the point.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.608
You're not serious about
this lemon, are you?

57:25.609 --> 57:27.336
Butt out, Dundee!

57:28.028 --> 57:30.051
He had a little too much to drink.

57:30.238 --> 57:32.823
Richard is warm, caring,
and I love him, okay?

57:32.824 --> 57:34.158
- Excuse me.
- What?

57:34.159 --> 57:35.977
I think I'm going to throw up.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.471
God.

57:58.475 --> 58:01.124
- You want a hand?
- No. I can handle it.

58:01.395 --> 58:02.792
I'm fine.

58:05.983 --> 58:08.901
Listen, we've got a busy day
tomorrow, so get some sleep.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.128
I'll pick you up early.

58:10.404 --> 58:11.676
- Good night.
- Good night.

58:20.622 --> 58:23.374
- I think you better take me to the boozer.
- Boozer?

58:23.375 --> 58:25.227
Don't know that one.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.920
Pub. You know, somewhere
to get a drink.

58:27.921 --> 58:31.366
- Want to join me?
- I just finished my shift. Why not?

58:32.467 --> 58:35.094
- Fancy a drink, do you?
- You kidding? I'm Italian.

58:35.095 --> 58:38.290
I'd drink you under the
table any day, my friend.

58:39.349 --> 58:40.792
Well, that could be interesting.

58:50.277 --> 58:53.176
No, I'm not putting down
your black widow spider,

58:54.031 --> 58:57.324
but the funnel-web spider can
kill a man in eight seconds,

58:57.325 --> 58:58.426
just by looking at him.

59:01.955 --> 59:04.206
Of course, the real danger down
there is the sharks, though,

59:04.207 --> 59:06.333
the big ones, you know, like <i>Jaws</i> ?

59:06.334 --> 59:08.627
I caught one down there
about three weeks ago.

59:08.628 --> 59:10.901
Got it opened. Know what
we found inside it?

59:11.131 --> 59:13.359
Three Filipino fishermen...

59:13.467 --> 59:15.801
- Still in their boat.
- Hey, buzzy!

59:15.802 --> 59:18.200
Come on over, meet this
guy from Australia.

59:19.806 --> 59:22.125
Hey, my man, what's happening?

59:22.684 --> 59:24.127
Uh, where?

59:24.478 --> 59:26.455
What's goin' down, bro?

59:26.980 --> 59:30.630
Goin' down? Ah, yeah. Just
blowing the froth off a couple.

59:31.151 --> 59:33.424
All right! Hang loose, my man.

59:34.946 --> 59:37.765
- Flat out like a lizard drinking.
- Say what?

59:39.534 --> 59:40.760
What?

59:47.334 --> 59:48.777
He's cool.

59:49.044 --> 59:51.112
Yeah. I'm cool. I'm cool.

59:59.888 --> 01:00:01.222
All right!

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:02.745
All right!

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.685
He's a nice fellow.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:09.480
Here's my little
Italian mate, Danny.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:11.690
Just in time to buy
another round, too, mate.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.109
What are you drinking, Gwendoline?

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:16.946
Ah, no more for me. Thanks, Mick.
I must be getting on home.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.139
Oh.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.843
Where's, uh...
Where's home, sweetie?

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.827
Just around the corner.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:25.287
I have a little place where
I live all by my lonesome.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.455
Not now.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.809
- Most of the time, that is.
- Oh.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.001
Must, uh...

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.586
Must get a bit lonely, eh?

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.713
Hanker for a bit of,
uh, male company?

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.282
Do I ever.

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.592
Hey, come here.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:40.636
Uh, excuse me, Gwendoline.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.455
Don't go away, love.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.226
I have been trying to
tell you all night.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:49.750
That girl, she's a guy.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.021
Huh?

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:53.341
A man dressed up as a girl.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:55.693
Nah.

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:58.422
A fag, for Christ's sakes!

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.351
I swear.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:18.883
Oh!

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.219
Hey... That was a guy.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.055
A guy dressed up like
a sheila. Look at that.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:27.433
Hey, you all knew,
you pack of bastards.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:30.370
Hey! Ah!

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:40.279
Where the hell did I leave the cab?

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.697
Don't know.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:44.158
You wait here until I
go look for it, mate.

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:45.806
Righto, mate.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.411
G'day, girls.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.913
Mick Dundee from Australia.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:17.087
Looking for a good time, honey?

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:19.553
Always looking for a good time.

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:30.496
Are either of you ladies attached
or married or anything like that?

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.916
No. We're both single ladies.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.610
This is Karla. I'm Simone.
Where you from, honey?

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:47.388
I'm from Walkabout Creek
in the Northern Territory.

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.116
You probably don't
know where that is.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:53.123
Hey. I do.

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:56.021
You're the guy I've been
reading about in the paper,

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.356
the "Crocodile Man."

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.233
I've been reading about
him in the paper.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.110
He's like a regular Tarzan.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:04.306
Wrestles crocodiles, eats snakes.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.219
Is this your first
trip to New York?

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.937
First trip anywhere.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.083
Well, hell.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.711
We might just have to
give you one for free.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:21.981
Yeah.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:25.736
One what?

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:32.617
Huh.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:39.440
Ah, maybe we could take in a movie
or, you know, go to a dance or...

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.760
Hey, girls, girls.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:45.237
Are we working tonight
or are we socializing?

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:46.590
Hey, pal.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.769
I was just talking to the ladies
and making a bit of progress.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:56.024
Are you going to talk all night, my
man, or you going to screw one of them?

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.007
Listen, I'm sorry about that,

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:08.078
but if you stand around out the
front of a place like this,

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.678
you're going to hear that
kind of bad language.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.847
I should've been home hours ago.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.200
Nice chatting to you, ladies.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.935
Hey, come on, Dan. You're
in no condition to drive.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.538
Hop in, mate.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:23.859
That's why you have so many
accidents over here...

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.054
The steering wheel's on the
wrong side of the car.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.892
Get out of the way, dopey!

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:43.731
Get on the right side of
the road, you pelican!

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.704
<i>If I give my heart to you</i>

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:02.920
<i>Then I'll have none
and you'll have two</i>

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.447
<i>Señor</i> Mick?

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:31.885
Ah.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:34.080
The towels for <i>Señor</i> Mick.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.120
Is that you, Rosita?

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:39.268
Just leave the spare towels
on the bed, will you?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:41.167
<i>Muchas gracias</i>, love.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.836
<i>Si, Señor</i> Mick.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.373
Struth!

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.442
Um... Hey, listen, uh...

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:05.979
Rosita, uh...

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.005
I was only being friendly.

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:10.048
You know, I didn't mean, um...

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:12.652
Your towels, <i>Señor</i> Mick.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:14.571
Oh. Phew.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.437
For a minute there, um...

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.506
Room service took on
a whole new meaning.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.869
One dog, please.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:06.414
With chili, onions,
sauerkraut, and some peppers.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:13.880
There you go.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:15.219
You eat that?

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:19.385
Well, you know, you can live on
it, but it tastes like shit.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.549
My bag!

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.234
Somebody stop him!

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.757
Thief! Thief!

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.618
Hey, Mick!

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.995
How you doing, baby?
It's me, Simone!

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.496
Oh, yeah, Simone.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:47.706
Having a good time?

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.149
As always.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.404
Nice girl.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.421
Thoughtful, too...

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.524
- Dancing with her father.
- Hmm.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.841
You'll have to overcome this

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:01.162
- country boy shyness, Dundee.
- Hi.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:02.453
Yeah.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.245
Oh, there's someone
I want you to meet.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.395
Ah! Sue, darling! You're back.

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.439
How wonderful.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:14.608
Fran, how are you?

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.551
Couldn't be better.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:20.506
Tell me, who's the new man?

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.325
This is the man I'm writing
about, Mick Dundee.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.643
Oh!

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:28.018
Something the matter, darling?

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.749
Oh!

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.959
Hi. Pleased to meet you.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.438
It's okay. He's Australian.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:39.818
Maybe I'd better go there someday.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.095
Oh, darling, I'm so
glad you could come.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.538
Excuse me.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:51.337
Ah. Just making sure.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.438
Right.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.041
I'll get us a drink.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.129
It's good shit.

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:34.524
What's up, pal? Got a
blocked nose, have you?

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.109
Blocked nose. Right.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.031
There's a better way
of doing it than that.

01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:41.238
Better way, huh?

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:43.983
Yep.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.011
It's the way we do it back home.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.035
It really fixes us up.

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:02.965
Now, boil the water,

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:06.404
get the steam going. Right.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:08.599
Put your face right over that.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.978
And the old tea towel
over your scalp.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.204
Put your head right down onto that.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:16.307
Breathe it in real deep.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.836
Ten minutes of that, you'll be
clear as a bell. No worries.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.232
Get into it.

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:33.657
That will do it.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.104
You know, Mick, that was probably

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:41.273
a couple hundred dollars'
worth of cocaine.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.502
What's that?

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:47.005
Oh. It's a drug. You sniff it.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:49.386
What for?

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.718
Well, to get a buzz.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.438
What, like shoving a
blowfly up your nose?

01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:12.364
Got the photo, Mick.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:13.993
I look great.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.742
Yeah.

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.915
Ida sends love.

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:20.630
Wait a minute. Donk wants
to have a word to you.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.632
Mick! Get stuffed!

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.359
Very good.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.279
How you getting on with
the New Yorkers, Mick?

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.822
<i>Oh, bonzer people.</i>

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:34.052
<i>Friendly, full of beans,
but, uh, a bit weird.</i>

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:37.101
<i>Well, that's the joys of traveling.</i>

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.436
<i>Uh. When are you coming home, mate?</i>

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:42.477
Well, if you can manage,
Wal, I'd like to stay a while.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.442
Oh, yeah. No troubles at all.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:49.451
Wouldn't have anything to do with
a certain lady writer, would it?

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.635
Yeah, well,

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.955
to start with, she's a
better kisser than Donk.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:56.744
You little beauty.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:58.626
Keep in touch.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.291
<i>Yeah. No worries, Wal. Ta-ta.</i>

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:05.815
Come on, Wal, what'd he say?

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:08.234
Well, he wants to stay there
a little while longer.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.303
He wants me to take
care of things here.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.352
You got a light, buddy?

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.689
Yeah. Sure, kid. There you go.

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:30.149
And your wallet.

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.078
Mick, give him your wallet.

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:36.989
- What for?
- He's got a knife.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.418
That's not a knife.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:44.956
That's a knife.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:53.214
Shit!

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:01.855
Just kids having fun.
Are you all right?

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.416
I'm always all right when
I'm with you, Dundee.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.895
God, that sounds corny.

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:11.316
Why do you always make me feel
like Jane in a Tarzan comic?

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.931
That's what we ran while
you were down under.

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:04.751
Sorry. Can't seem to
get my mind in gear.

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:12.776
Sue, when you were away,

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:15.926
I, uh... I did some thinking.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.434
It's time I made
some concrete plans.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:21.993
Are you building a freeway

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.847
or proposing to the finest
catch in New York state?

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:27.816
Hello, young lady. Been
reading your articles.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.709
It seems you've been
tripping all over the world,

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.778
enjoying yourself at our expense.

01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:34.902
Well, I'd like to think you're
getting your money's worth.

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:38.510
Hi, Dad.

01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:40.784
You got a kiss for the old man?

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.625
Thank God you're home safe.

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:50.855
Have you told Sue about Sunday?

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.398
Oh, I was just about to.

01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:55.193
You're coming out to the weekend
house for a welcome home dinner.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:57.028
But, right now, I want
Richard to explain

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:58.696
how he runs this newspaper
better than I do

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.344
when I'm away.

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:04.141
By all means, bring along
this, uh, Crocodile Dundee.

01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:06.063
Him, I've got to meet.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.658
I thought you said your
dad sells newspapers.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.784
Oh, well...

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.887
He sells a lot of newspapers.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.544
Thank you, Gus.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:18.423
Oh, hell. The dogs are out.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:20.759
Mick.

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:11.101
Nice to see you again,
Miss. Mr. Mason.

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:13.665
Good to see you looking
so fit and well.

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:15.518
Simpson, Mr. Dundee.

01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:18.771
Nice to meet you, Simo.

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:23.613
Call me Mick.

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:25.277
Mick.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.512
Ahem. Your father's
expecting you, Miss.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.490
He's waiting with his
guests in the lounge.

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:43.762
Oh, excuse me.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.183
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi, Dad.

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:50.935
- Richard.
- Good to see you.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:53.579
And this of course is Mr. Dundee.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.706
Yep.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.327
I believe I'm deeply in your debt
for saving my daughter's life.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.938
Well, um... Buy me a cold beer,
and we'll call it quits.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:04.882
Nice joint you got here.

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:07.218
Well, it keeps the
rain off our heads.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:09.242
Come. I want you to
meet some people.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.327
Patricia, a drink for Mr. Dundee.

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.577
Oh, my God, look who's here.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.770
- My Dawn.
- How are you?

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:20.231
Dorothy and Wendell
Wainwright. From Australia.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:21.816
- Oh.
- Nice to meet you, Wendell.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.651
Mick. Have a drink.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.736
Thank you.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:27.260
Are you involved in
cattle, Mr. Dundee?

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:29.240
Yeah. Mostly buffaloes.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:31.139
- Oh.
- Do you breed them?

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.077
No, I just toss them.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:35.351
And how are you finding New York?

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:38.166
- Bit of a lunatic asylum, eh?
- Oh.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.959
That's why I love it,
'cause I fit right in.

01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:45.048
if you'll excuse me, I'd like Mick
to say hello to Senator Manly.

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.742
That's a good idea.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:48.736
- It was nice meeting you.
- See you later.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:52.638
Seems like a personable fellow.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:53.991
What a strange gentleman.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:55.542
Nice people.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:58.708
Dorothy's fine now, but she
used to be really uptight.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:00.897
What happened?

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:02.545
She found a wonderful shrink.

01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:05.464
Psychiatrist.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:10.433
I shouldn't have made that crack
about the lunatic asylum.

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:14.327
Didn't know she was nuts.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:16.681
Of course, she's not nuts.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:20.625
People go to a psychiatrist
to talk about their problems.

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:22.668
She just needed to unload them.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:24.712
You know, bring them
out in the open.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.315
Hasn't she got any mates?

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:30.160
You're right. Guess we
could all use more mates.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.573
I suppose you don't have any
shrinks at Walkabout Creek?

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:37.250
No. Back there, if you got
a problem, you tell Wally.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.185
And he tells everyone in town,

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:41.505
brings it out in the
open, no more problem.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.358
Richard! You could
make it this evening.

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:46.651
Wendell, good to see you.

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:48.236
And I don't believe I
know your daughter.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.737
- Oh, stop it!
- Oh, Richard!

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.064
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:06.355
Friends. Welcome home, Sue.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:15.346
As... As you can see, we're
all glad to have you back.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.120
Of course, no one more than I.

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:20.335
I guess everyone in this room

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:23.542
knows how this beautiful lady
and I I feel about each other.

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:27.967
Sue's come back to us,

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:31.134
delivered, literally, out
of the jaws of death

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:34.433
by our new-found friend,
Mr. Michael J. Dundee.

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:39.305
A man... A man to whom
I am doubly indebted.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:42.290
Of course, not only did he bring
back to me the woman that I love,

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.958
but he managed to
increase the circulation

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:45.527
of the newspaper in the process.

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:50.316
You know, uh...
Sam said to me earlier,

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:51.841
"You're her editor."

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:55.052
"Can't you stop her from taking
all these dangerous assignments?"

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:58.055
Well, quite obviously, I have
not had a great deal of success

01:22:58.056 --> 01:22:59.999
influencing her as her editor.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:03.211
Perhaps I'll have more
success as her husband.

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:07.333
- If she'll have me.
- Oh, Richard.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.066
Congratulations.

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.868
It's a pleasure having
you here to share this.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:38.429
Well done. Well done.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.454
Thank you very much. I couldn't
have done it without your help.

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.461
Sweetheart?

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:02.054
I'll get in the back, Gus.

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.240
To the hotel, Mick?

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:25.415
Yeah, Gus, by way
of a liquor store.

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:32.467
For medicinal purposes.

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:36.717
Thanks, mate.

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.204
Hey, you take care, now.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:23.719
Hey, buddy.

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.686
Get it into you, pop.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:31.523
God bless you. You
saved my life, really.

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:43.830
Hey, Simone.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:50.704
You want some action?

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.924
Uh, I thought you
were somebody else.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.028
Well, if it ain't the
man who don't like

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:01.552
bad fucking language
in front of ladies.

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:04.677
What's the matter, Aussie boy?

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.849
You going to make like a
kangaroo and hop away?

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:30.457
Time for a little tap dance.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.118
You okay, Mick?

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:06.242
Oh, yeah, Gus. No worries.

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:08.581
I was just getting on top of them.

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:22.194
You sure you're not
Pintinjarra tribe?

01:27:22.195 --> 01:27:24.989
No, man. Harlem Warlords.

01:27:26.116 --> 01:27:27.968
I knew you were tribal.

01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:38.945
Mick Dundee's room, please.

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:56.687
<i>I'm sorry. He's still
not answering.</i>

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:59.962
Uh, he called down this morning
to say he was checking out today.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:02.344
<i>We're going to miss
him around here.</i>

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:03.719
Thanks.

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:14.935
Thank you, sir.

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.216
G'day, Irving. How are you, mate?

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:27.991
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't
be dead for dollars.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:29.470
Close.

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:31.790
Are you leaving us, Mick?
You going back home?

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.997
Ah, no. I thought I'd go Walkabout.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:36.544
Huh?

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:39.168
Wander around,
take a look at America.

01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:41.007
For how long?

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:43.502
Long as it takes.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.421
What's the quickest
way out of town?

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:47.738
Well, if you're looking
for adventure,

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.573
there's a subway two
blocks that way.

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:51.575
It'll take you to Grand
Central Station.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:53.223
That'll do. Uh...

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:56.356
Have a nice day, Oiving.

01:28:56.915 --> 01:28:59.109
Uh, no worries, mate.

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:29.638
- Morning, Miss.
- Morning.

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:31.842
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:35.452
No, but it will come to me.

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:38.038
Incidentally, Miss, if you're
looking for Crocodile Mick,

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.561
he's gone walkabout.

01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:41.939
I don't suppose you know where?

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:44.920
Yeah. He's headed for the
subway two blocks down.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:46.364
You'd better hurry.

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:48.195
Mind this for me.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:58.873
Oh, Christ.

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:21.330
Hey, lady, where you going?

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:23.894
If you want to play, why
don't you play with me?

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:32.344
Mick!

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:33.972
Mick Dundee!

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:38.518
- Ooowweee!
- What's up, lady?

01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.620
I got to talk to that
man down the end.

01:31:41.621 --> 01:31:42.938
The one in the black hat.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.353
Hey!

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:55.785
Lady here wants to talk to
the guy in the black hat!

01:31:57.846 --> 01:31:59.914
Hey, fella!

01:32:00.306 --> 01:32:01.953
You in the hat!

01:32:02.225 --> 01:32:04.578
The lady down the end
wants to see you!

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:07.671
What does she want?

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:10.963
What does she want?

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:13.131
What do you want?

01:32:14.863 --> 01:32:17.261
Tell him not to leave.

01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:20.052
I'm not going to marry Richard.

01:32:23.163 --> 01:32:27.018
Tell him don't leave. She's
not going to marry Richard.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:31.730
Don't leave. I'm not
going to marry Richard.

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:36.113
Why not?

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:38.036
I don't know.

01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:39.570
Why not?

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:41.906
Why not?

01:32:44.184 --> 01:32:46.286
Tell him I love him.

01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:48.584
I love you!

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:51.753
I love ya!

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:56.717
I love ya! I love ya!

01:32:57.864 --> 01:32:59.591
She loves me.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.092
Well?

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.219
Um, tell her I...

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.184
I'll tell her meself.
I'm coming through.

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:07.607
He's coming through!

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:09.275
He's coming through!

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:16.779
It's too crowded. We're
jammed in like sheep.

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.822
Up, up, up.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:21.783
Coming through!
