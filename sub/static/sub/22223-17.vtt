WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:02.663
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.753 --> 00:04.539
What do you desire
with wormholes?

00:04.630 --> 00:06.131
To go home.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.178
That really is Kansas.

00:11.262 --> 00:13.173
Would you like to come in?

00:13.264 --> 00:15.346
Yeah, thanks.
-Oh.

00:15.433 --> 00:16.889
Who are you people?

00:16.976 --> 00:18.307
Aliens.

00:19.395 --> 00:21.636
You been, uh, stealing candy,
Mr. Burroughs?

00:21.731 --> 00:26.020
Oh, Crichton, how illegal
is this dren? You've
gotta get me more!

00:26.110 --> 00:28.772
Crichton:
1812, this is Bobby.
Bobby, this is 1812.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.070
1812 is gonna be your
tour guide.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.442
Don't let him break anything.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.864
lwon't break anything.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.691
Hey, I got this great idea.

00:35.786 --> 00:39.324
How about... how about we
break out of here and go
make some new friends?

00:39.415 --> 00:42.122
Chiana, you know the humans
will not let us out unescorted.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.247
And the way you make friends,
I do not blame them.

00:45.338 --> 00:48.830
Where's Aeryn, Aeryn?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.215
(electronic crackling )

00:52.303 --> 00:53.509
A bioloid.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.712
D'Argo:
You know, it's not Aeryn.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.637
Crichton:
It was never Aeryn.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.886
We're not gonna give up
on her, John.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.515
Sikozu said the Scarrans
are taking Grayza to a
place called Katratzi.

01:03.606 --> 01:05.892
Maybe that's where
Aeryn is now.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.190
She could be anywhere
out there.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.108
But we're not gonna let her go.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.312
I give you my word.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.397
And now, on Farscape.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.192
Monroe:
Officer Aeryn Sun.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.245
General Ka D'Argo.

01:21.332 --> 01:25.871
Sikozu Svala Shanti
Sugaysi Shanu.

01:25.962 --> 01:28.499
Dominar Rygel, the Sixteenth.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.424
Utu Noranti Pralatong.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.594
The Pilot.

01:36.681 --> 01:42.267
These are the first
extraterrestrials known
to have visited this planet.

01:42.353 --> 01:46.096
It has now been several months
since they left with
Commander John Crichton,

01:46.190 --> 01:48.306
aboard their ship, Moya.

01:48.401 --> 01:53.612
And besides their names,
what else do we really
know about them?

01:53.698 --> 01:55.279
Precious little,

01:55.366 --> 02:00.531
except the carefully
orchestrated appearances
allowed by our government.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.243
Good evening.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.164
I'm your host,
R. Wilson Monroe.

02:05.251 --> 02:10.336
(over TV speaker):
And tonight we will pierce the
veil of secrecy showing you these aliens

02:10.423 --> 02:13.790
as no one has witnessed them
before. This network...

02:13.884 --> 02:15.670
Rygel:
How many times are you
going to watch this?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.342
Crichton:
Till I figure it out.

02:17.430 --> 02:20.888
I told Pilot not to let you
know he'd intercepted it.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.590
They never even gave
it a chance.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.676
Well, what do you expect?

02:24.770 --> 02:27.603
It's not what you expect,
it's what you hope for.

02:27.690 --> 02:32.229
Rygel:
It's a backward planet
full of superstitious, xenophobic morons.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.606
Nothing makes sense if they
didn't think of it first,

02:34.697 --> 02:37.860
and even then it's
simplistic drivel.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.862
Beg pardon. How rude.
Are you from there?

02:40.953 --> 02:42.068
Out!

02:42.163 --> 02:44.779
Wait! You can't do that!

02:44.874 --> 02:48.287
My quarters. My life. My TV.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.163
This won't...
-Your popcorn.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.587
...bring her back, you know?
-No, but it'll keep you
out of my room.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.177
Sikozu Shanu?

02:57.261 --> 02:58.922
No.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.298
Nothing?

03:00.389 --> 03:03.552
A reasonable interpretation
of the word "no."

03:03.642 --> 03:05.178
Katratzi.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.510
It's the name of a place, the
place where they took Aeryn.

03:07.605 --> 03:12.269
Sikozu:
As stupid as you must
think them, the Scarrans have managed to build

03:12.360 --> 03:16.569
one of the most extensive
empires in the galaxy in part,

03:16.655 --> 03:20.193
and I shall repeat this because
it does not seem to sink in,

03:20.284 --> 03:24.778
by not advertising the location
of their secret bases.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.612
Are you asking the right people?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.493
And who would they be?

03:28.584 --> 03:30.495
Are you asking in Scarran?

03:30.586 --> 03:32.372
Of course I am, you Raskreetal

03:32.463 --> 03:36.081
I know what that means
and I love you, too.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.881
Well you've earned it.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.131
Bother me one more time and
you can come down here and
do this for yourself.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.305
Monroe:
When we come back, we will
meet Officer Aeryn Sun,

03:44.392 --> 03:49.136
rumored within may circles to
be John Crichton's lover.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.768
This alien, who looks
remarkably human,

03:52.858 --> 03:56.646
will reveal a side of herself
that you may find disturbing.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.318
Well I look like your
people, so...

03:58.406 --> 04:03.275
Monroe:
Please, stay with us, as
Alien Visitation continues.

04:08.249 --> 04:12.162
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:12.253 --> 04:16.041
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.918
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

04:18.008 --> 04:21.216
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

04:21.303 --> 04:23.043
my friends.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.926
I've made enemies.

04:26.016 --> 04:29.258
Powerful, dangerous.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.811
Now all I want is to
find a way home

04:32.898 --> 04:35.640
to warn Earth.

04:35.734 --> 04:40.819
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

05:11.437 --> 05:15.897
Earth is under no threat
from the Peacekeepers.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.564
But you said...

05:17.651 --> 05:24.147
Look, if... if you were to
make a pact with an enemy,
then perhaps.

05:24.241 --> 05:29.827
So, the possibility exists
that your people one day
would attack?

05:29.914 --> 05:34.203
(sighs heavily)
Why are you so determined
to twist this into something it's not?

05:34.293 --> 05:41.461
Because, Officer Sun, you are
an admitted soldier in, what is
to us, an alien army.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.710
You look human.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.292
lndistinguishable to
the naked eye.

05:45.387 --> 05:49.380
How are we to know that there
aren't thousands of your people
roaming our planet,

05:49.475 --> 05:51.215
preparing our destruction?

05:51.310 --> 05:54.268
Aeryn:
Surely John Crichton
has explained this to you all already.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.767
Well, we need to
hear it from you.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.358
Hear what?

05:58.442 --> 06:00.774
That Earth is sacrosanct?

06:00.861 --> 06:03.898
That your perfect isolation
can somehow be restored?

06:03.989 --> 06:05.854
Is that it?

06:05.950 --> 06:09.784
Look, from what I know of the
Peacekeepers, and of anyone
else for that matter,

06:09.870 --> 06:11.952
they couldn't care less
about this planet.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.904
You're not a threat.

06:13.999 --> 06:19.369
Technologically speaking,
you're not even a potential
ally, so...( sighs)

06:19.463 --> 06:23.581
if someone wanted to
enslave you, if they
wanted to destroy you,

06:23.676 --> 06:25.632
could it be done?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.586
Well, quite simply, yes.

06:28.681 --> 06:33.471
The reason you have not seen
that interview before is
because it was held back,

06:33.561 --> 06:39.522
after requests from both our
own government and the United
Nations Secretary-General.

06:39.608 --> 06:47.401
Tonight, we have our first look
at over 120 hours of previously
unseen videotape on the aliens.

06:47.491 --> 06:51.404
Tonight, you have the chance to
see portions of this material,

06:51.495 --> 06:54.658
along with comments from
various experts and leaders.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.240
But first, I'm joined by the
remarkable young man

06:58.335 --> 07:03.125
who was fortunate enough to
be in the right place at
the right time with,

07:03.215 --> 07:06.878
and this is always helpful,
the right connections.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.301
Bobby Coleman,
John Crichton's nephew.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.548
Welcome, Bobby.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.630
Bobby:
Good to be here.

07:12.725 --> 07:18.095
Monroe:
Tell me, how did you and that
camera manage to get all this remarkable footage?

07:18.188 --> 07:23.399
Well, when my uncle got back
to Earth, my mom's
Uncle John's older sister.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.898
We flew down to Florida and
I got to stay on for
a couple of weeks

07:26.989 --> 07:29.571
with my Aunt Olivia,
my grandpa and the aliens.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.775
And the aliens didn't mind
you videotaping them?

07:32.870 --> 07:34.576
No. It was pretty cool.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.779
How did you find them, Bobby?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.707
They're normal,
just like you and me.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.660
Normal? Clearly alien.

07:42.755 --> 07:43.710
Yeah.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.207
Some more than others.

07:45.299 --> 07:49.008
You spent many days in
their company. Did you
ever feel threatened?

07:49.094 --> 07:50.709
No.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.796
Did you ever get a sense
that there was a conspiracy
between them?

07:53.891 --> 07:55.427
No way.

07:55.517 --> 07:59.886
So, why did you and your family
wait so long to make these
tapes public?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.596
Well, we thought about
it for a long time,

08:02.691 --> 08:06.400
and with all these weird
accusations starting to surface,

08:06.487 --> 08:10.480
we decided that it was best to
help everyone not be afraid.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.439
I've seen lots of your movies,

08:12.534 --> 08:19.246
and in every film, the aliens
are always evil, and Earth
always is victorious.

08:19.333 --> 08:23.417
Bobby:
You mean we have to learn
there are good aliens?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.374
No.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.332
I mean you have to learn
you won't always win.

08:30.427 --> 08:34.045
This is a watershed moment
in human history.

08:34.139 --> 08:39.259
The equivalent of a huge
meteor smashing Earth
during dinosaur times.

08:39.353 --> 08:43.687
Will we bend under the sudden
weight of it or respond
and flourish?

08:43.774 --> 08:47.642
You can't even fully accept us,
and we're the nice aliens.

08:47.736 --> 08:51.320
You know, what about some of
the next ones that come down
through the wormhole?

08:51.407 --> 08:55.025
My biggest fear, exacerbated
in part by these tapes

08:55.119 --> 08:58.828
is that the fabric of our
society may come under
an assault

08:58.914 --> 09:01.280
it is not yet prepared
to withstand.

09:01.375 --> 09:06.460
The political complications that
may arise from a simple wormhole
floating in your atmosphere

09:06.547 --> 09:12.133
will devastate a planet that
is still in the throes of
intraspecies chaos!

09:12.219 --> 09:18.465
I'm particularly concerned
with the effects of another
alien visitation on society in general.

09:18.559 --> 09:24.054
Since they've left, there's
been a 700% increase in panic
and anxiety attacks.

09:24.148 --> 09:31.566
If Earth is remembered at all,
it will most likely be for the
quality of its manual labor.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.147
In culling through the
staggering amount of
candid material,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.574
recorded on young Bobby
Coleman's tapes,

09:37.661 --> 09:43.622
there was one alien visitor in
particular who never failed to
elicit extreme curiosity

09:43.709 --> 09:46.542
among staffers here
at the network.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.209
General Ka D'Argo.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.788
Ship Computer:
Power systems at your
command, Ka D'Argo.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.124
Bobby:
Your ship is so cool.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.378
D'Argo:
It's a weapon.

09:54.470 --> 09:55.676
Yeah.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.924
It kills people.

09:58.015 --> 10:01.428
Whoa. Like monsters and stuff?

10:02.811 --> 10:06.224
Yeah, sometimes but
sometimes just, uh,

10:06.315 --> 10:09.022
kills those who are in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.600
You said you'd show me
what it could do.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.686
All right, give me that.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.817
Come on.
-You know how to work it?

10:15.908 --> 10:18.991
Look, I've flown this through
a wormhole. I'm sure I'll
be able to work it out.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.205
Computer:
Telemetry functions
at your command.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.156
So I look through this and
what am I gonna...

10:25.250 --> 10:28.208
It's a recording captured
through my targeting array.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.377
Whoa...

10:31.757 --> 10:34.248
It's just that...

10:34.343 --> 10:37.426
It just disappeared.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.799
It's a rogue Leviathan.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.677
It tried to kill us and we
had to destroy it.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.258
Could you...

10:44.353 --> 10:48.562
I mean, could we... stop you
if you tried to attack us?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.560
With your current defenses, no.

10:50.651 --> 10:56.112
The most frightening aspect
of this Pandora's Box we've
opened is he may be right.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.359
Huh, from what I've heard,

10:58.450 --> 11:02.284
his ship has our best and
brightest utterly perplexed.

11:02.371 --> 11:06.831
By indicating that our current
defenses could not contain him

11:06.917 --> 11:11.035
General D'Argo is performing an
act of psychological terror.

11:11.129 --> 11:15.873
(tape fast-forwarding )

11:15.968 --> 11:18.550
D'Argo:
Yeah, I think it's time
we were leaving now.

11:18.637 --> 11:21.174
Bobby:
You're leaving? Why?

11:21.265 --> 11:23.677
Well, because there are some
people here, some very
powerful people,

11:23.767 --> 11:26.224
who don't appreciate
what we're doing.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.688
They're kicking you out.

11:28.772 --> 11:33.311
No, but they're making it
very difficult for us to
continue down here.

11:34.319 --> 11:38.562
( fast-forwarding )

11:38.657 --> 11:41.444
D'Argo:
It might be a bit dramatic
for one Luxan, but, uh,

11:41.535 --> 11:44.151
I can do enough damage to your
world to change it forever.

11:44.246 --> 11:48.034
You know, you really shouldn't
be watching this.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.741
Here's a tape you brought
back from Earth.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.254
( crowd cheering )

11:56.341 --> 11:58.332
Crichton:
State wins. No big plays.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.292
Put mine back in.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.260
Katratzi.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.678
What?

12:03.765 --> 12:06.142
We can't find it.
Pilot's searched every
frequency, every...

12:06.226 --> 12:10.014
No, the Scarrans have Aeryn
in a box, D'Argo.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.094
I know.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.316
Katratzi.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.021
Katratzi. Why do I
know that name?

12:17.112 --> 12:19.979
Sikozu heard the Scarrans say
it as they were arresting
Commandant Grayza.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.280
No, from before.
You know it, too.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.117
You're confused.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.284
No, I'm not.
Why do I know that name?

12:26.371 --> 12:30.034
No, you're not getting enough
sleep and you're watching
too much of this.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.036
They hate you guys.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.051
Well, I liked it there.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.466
You see the show?

12:41.553 --> 12:42.258
No.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.132
You should.

12:44.222 --> 12:47.009
It's educational.
They're not ready.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.933
We should move on.
Inquire at nearby planets.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.432
No, no, no. They won't know.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.514
I know! No, I know,
I know, I know!

12:55.609 --> 12:57.270
Just...

12:58.820 --> 13:01.277
put my tape back in.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.401
Olivia:
...change in John is,

13:03.492 --> 13:06.154
he's even more thoughtful
than he was.

13:06.244 --> 13:10.112
He studies everything keenly
before deciding what to do.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.244
I'm here with Un... IASA
Commander John Crichton,

13:13.335 --> 13:17.829
the first and only human
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

13:19.216 --> 13:22.629
You spent over three years in
deepest, darkest space,

13:22.719 --> 13:25.335
battling aliens and evil races.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.386
What was the worst part?

13:28.392 --> 13:31.304
The worst part. Um...

13:31.395 --> 13:36.264
was the complete and utter
lack of toilet paper.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.019
Seriously?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.566
Missing family.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.906
When you got back, what was
most different about Earth?

13:45.993 --> 13:48.905
Nothing, Bobby.
Earth's pretty much the same.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.987
Are you different?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.960
Yeah, I'm different.
-How?

13:56.044 --> 14:00.913
Well, things that used to
bother me don't bother me
that much anymore.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.632
The world seems smaller.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.511
And I keep waiting for
something to happen

14:08.598 --> 14:13.968
and l have to remind myself
when it doesn't happen that
that's normal.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.144
Post-traumatic shock syndrome.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.893
It's hard to tell without
examining him,

14:18.984 --> 14:21.191
but from this little
snippet of tape,

14:21.278 --> 14:25.567
I'm most concerned about his
constantly waiting for
something to happen.

14:25.657 --> 14:29.741
This suggests he's been under
enormous and continuous stress.

14:36.835 --> 14:40.623
You're supposed to be checking
for this place that they've
taken Aeryn.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.375
No one has heard of it.

14:42.466 --> 14:45.003
Well, Crichton still thinks
that you're checking.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.254
He needs to keep
believing that.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.803
I've been done for arns.
Pilot has double-checked.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.677
No one has heard of it. No one!

14:52.768 --> 14:54.804
Well, they must be lying.

14:54.895 --> 14:58.183
No, Chiana, they're not lying.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.810
How can you tell if
they're not lying?

15:00.901 --> 15:03.483
You can't tell when I'm lying.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.276
Yes, we can. We all can.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.775
How?

15:07.866 --> 15:11.233
You open your mouth and
words come out of it.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.444
Don't you lie to Crichton.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.325
All right, Chiana.
-Checking.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.953
All right, I'm done. You try!

15:25.258 --> 15:26.759
Bobby:
What ya doing?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.219
Making rat poison.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.294
You gonna kill a few?

15:30.388 --> 15:34.848
On the contrary. The rats asked
me to make this so that they
can kill some humans.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.426
Ha, ha.

15:37.521 --> 15:42.936
Every planet has its indigenous
potions just waiting to be
blended and discovered.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.106
I'm playing.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.606
What did you think of
South America?

15:46.696 --> 15:49.233
Very verdant. Uh, green.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.280
No green people, though.
Now, that's a shame.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.326
I heard a lot of people
got freaked out about
your third eye.

15:54.412 --> 15:59.076
Well, it was something about,
uh, witchcraft.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.953
They were very fearful.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.955
Rygel's going down to
sort it all out.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.254
l was in South America when
she came through.

16:06.341 --> 16:11.210
Many of the "miracles" she's
credited with have yet to
unravel under scrutiny.

16:11.304 --> 16:18.142
We're fairly certain we
know how she cured the
blind boy in Brazil.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.560
Why is it so hard for
us to believe

16:20.647 --> 16:25.107
that someone from another
planet can do things that
we find extraordinary?

16:25.193 --> 16:30.153
Isn't she herself extraordinary
just by being here?

16:30.240 --> 16:35.075
I like that you're always
striving to reach higher.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.493
Hoping for a better tomorrow.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.162
It's the quality that first
attracted me to your uncle.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.489
That humans dream?

16:40.584 --> 16:43.291
Yes. You're so ignorant,
but you never give up.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.539
Even in the face of
insurmountable odds.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.918
Listen to what she's
saying about us.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.876
Humans never give up.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.462
Now for that to become
impressed upon an alien mind,

16:55.557 --> 16:58.970
this simple fact that we
would tend to take for
granted ourselves

16:59.060 --> 17:04.054
becomes validation that we
eventually will fit in.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.685
Never give up.

17:05.775 --> 17:10.144
Ooh, if you like, I can mix
you something to help
your voice drop.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.819
No thanks.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.489
Watch out for the rats. They go
for the young ones first.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.942
She's actually really spiritual.

17:17.037 --> 17:21.497
You should hear her stories
about religions of all the
worlds she's visited.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.198
Really an eye opener.

17:23.293 --> 17:26.410
So much cruelty and
so much kindness.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.371
What constitutes a
good religion?

17:29.466 --> 17:31.252
Respect for life.

17:31.343 --> 17:34.130
Do unto others.
-Mm-hmm.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.552
Belief in a higher being?

17:35.639 --> 17:37.129
Of course.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.385
Hmm. Hypocrite.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.216
Me or everyone?

17:41.311 --> 17:46.180
Well, your religions justify
killing, and all forms of
atrocious behavior.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.651
Yeah, that's hard to deal with.

17:48.735 --> 17:53.149
Miss Noranti is not wrong
that we have a history
and culture of killing

17:53.240 --> 17:57.574
that we continually attempt to
wallpaper with justifications
and platitudes.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.993
| see nothing wrong with
what she's saying.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.071
See, killing is often
a part of life.

18:02.165 --> 18:07.000
What's hypocritical is to
condemn and then make allowances
when the situation suits.

18:07.087 --> 18:10.329
So it's okay to kill?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.581
Absolutely.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.382
Sometimes you must.

18:14.469 --> 18:18.712
You in some kind of cult?
Like a witch or something?

18:18.807 --> 18:20.217
Not at the moment.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.640
If her religion
justifies killing,

18:22.727 --> 18:26.015
then she's not someone I want
telling us what to believe.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.394
There is never an occasion
when murder is allowable.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.317
Life is the font of all that
we hold with respect.

18:32.404 --> 18:36.818
After she's had to kill
somebody, then I'll accept
her pronouncements.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.991
Do religions hate each other
where you come from?

18:40.078 --> 18:41.864
Oh, good heavens, no.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.321
Religions are grand,
lofty ideals.

18:44.416 --> 18:47.453
Religious followers,
now that's another story.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.034
Wars?

18:49.129 --> 18:50.460
Unspeakable.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.253
So we're not so different.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.717
Hmm, that's nothing to
be proud of.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.792
This is a dangerous woman.

18:56.886 --> 19:01.471
She effortlessly twists her
simple logic into something
that is almost believable,

19:01.558 --> 19:04.265
until you look deeper
and it unravels.

19:04.352 --> 19:08.265
Not the kind of personality
you would want running
around unchecked.

19:08.356 --> 19:12.315
Sometimes it's hard to
remember that just a
few short months ago...

19:12.402 --> 19:15.018
( fast-forwarding )

19:15.113 --> 19:17.525
Aeryn:
Well, what you have
to understand is,

19:17.615 --> 19:20.322
while cultures and civilizations
may vary wildly

19:20.410 --> 19:23.322
from socially primitive
to hyper-mechanized,

19:23.413 --> 19:26.530
there is still a uniformity
in the way that people
conduct their lives.

19:26.624 --> 19:30.208
You're saying wherever you
go in the universe,
we're all the same?

19:30.295 --> 19:32.251
Essentially, yes.

19:32.339 --> 19:36.127
In that way Earth is no
different from other planets.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.129
Other species from
different worlds?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.677
Do they have relationships,
marriage, children?

19:41.765 --> 19:44.302
Most definitely.
There are limits.

19:44.392 --> 19:48.135
The genetic patterns would have
to support such a union.

19:48.229 --> 19:53.519
And could a Sebacean such
as yourself procreate
with a human male?

19:56.905 --> 20:01.069
(rewinding)

20:01.159 --> 20:06.324
And could a Sebacean such
as yourself procreate
with a human male?

20:13.004 --> 20:14.210
Officer Sun?

20:23.348 --> 20:25.509
I believe Katratzi to be
some sort of base.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.340
Highly guarded.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.268
(rewinding)

20:34.234 --> 20:35.644
Officer Sun?

20:36.903 --> 20:40.737
Uh... uh... yes, I was
just thinking.

20:40.824 --> 20:43.406
Well, there's no way to
be sure at this point.

20:43.493 --> 20:46.576
However, our physiologies do
appear to be very similar.

20:47.288 --> 20:50.075
Remarkably so, in fact.

20:50.166 --> 20:56.332
Was Officer Sun's hesitation
at my question an honest
moment of introspection?

20:56.423 --> 20:58.163
Or was it something more?

20:58.258 --> 21:01.295
These are now the issues
we grapple with.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.251
How much to trust?

21:03.346 --> 21:06.509
How open do we allow
ourselves to become?

21:06.599 --> 21:10.137
Do we view an alien commingling
of our gene pool

21:10.228 --> 21:16.349
as a favorable step towards
integration into a larger
community, or as a threat?

21:19.654 --> 21:23.613
between those of Earth and
elsewhere is possible.

21:23.700 --> 21:29.946
Such marriages will foster bonds
of family and generate trust
between disparate peoples.

21:30.039 --> 21:35.079
If you thought children of
race-mixed parents took abuse
at the hands of other children,

21:35.170 --> 21:37.627
ait until one is born
with tentacles.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.751
Seriously now, what is
the big deal?

21:40.842 --> 21:44.676
Firstly, I do not believe
Aeryn's pregnant with
John's baby

21:44.762 --> 21:47.219
and secondly, if she was...

21:47.307 --> 21:49.923
Bobby:
Am I gonna get in trouble
for taping this.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.555
Well, not of the
physical kind, no.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.510
Olivia:
Are you gonna be okay?

21:55.231 --> 21:58.098
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.275
I'm just never gonna
be the same.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.147
Aeryn...
-Stop that.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.615
Remember when you tried to
hide that crush on...
-Stop it.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.815
Jill... what's her name?
-Stop it!

22:08.036 --> 22:10.027
Steiner. Her name was Steiner.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.034
What's my tell?

22:14.125 --> 22:17.868
Your lips. When you see Aeryn,
they soften just a bit.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.917
She has a word for us.
It's called "yesterday."

22:22.008 --> 22:24.465
Yeah, right.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.135
She have a tell?

22:28.223 --> 22:29.759
Yeah.

22:29.849 --> 22:30.929
What is it?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.553
Her eyes.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.305
She's waiting for you.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.306
Can we talk about
something else?

22:36.397 --> 22:37.682
Politics?

22:37.774 --> 22:41.141
Dr. Hamilton:
I for one like the idea
that we're not alone.

22:41.236 --> 22:43.067
So why not go all the way?

22:43.154 --> 22:46.317
Become part of the cultural
fabric of the new world in
which we'll live?

22:46.407 --> 22:49.820
cheyTeinlove,
theyTeinlove.

22:49.911 --> 22:53.495
You know this word: Katratzi.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.997
No.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.326
That wasn't a question.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.378
You heard it with me.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.172
Only from Sikozu.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.421
No. With me.

23:07.512 --> 23:08.672
No.

23:08.763 --> 23:09.923
Olivia:
You didn't have to.

23:10.014 --> 23:10.969
Aeryn:
Under the tree?

23:11.057 --> 23:11.967
Yeah, absolutely.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.514
Hi, Bobby.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.644
Bobby:
Is there one for me?

23:18.731 --> 23:20.346
Olivia:
Bobby...

23:20.441 --> 23:24.434
No. Actually, um, yours is
so big that it wouldn't
fit under the tree.

23:24.529 --> 23:28.147
Cool. 'Cause I got
you one, too.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.232
Chiana:
When do you give up?

23:30.326 --> 23:32.908
ldont

23:32.996 --> 23:34.657
Well, you gotta
give up sometime.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.248
No, I don't.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.744
Bobby:
Hey, Aunt Olivia, can you shoot
me and Aeryn together?

23:38.835 --> 23:42.043
Actually, I was just thinking
about shooting you.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.968
I'm like the coolest kid in
school 'cause of you guys.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.636
Oh, I'm sure you were
pretty cool before.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.680
Olivia:
Okay, I was about to...

23:54.767 --> 23:56.723
Well where do we find her?

23:57.520 --> 23:59.260
We find her.

24:00.982 --> 24:03.223
You could go back to Earth.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.229
Not without Aeryn.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.937
When you're born into military
service, the way I was,

24:09.032 --> 24:13.241
it's deemed best to not have any
ties to anyone but your unit.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.160
No brothers or sisters?

24:17.248 --> 24:18.909
Aunts or uncles?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.831
No.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.704
Didn't you miss that?

24:23.421 --> 24:25.787
Only once I was exposed to it.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.752
They don't like her there.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.879
They don't like any of us.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.713
Monroe:
Footage you're about to see
is simply intended...

24:35.808 --> 24:37.344
You watch too much TV.

24:37.435 --> 24:40.302
...to fuel the discussions that
will ultimately decide...

24:40.396 --> 24:43.229
-Yep.
...the direction we take
as a species.

24:43.316 --> 24:47.229
I'll be back shortly.
Please enjoy.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.936
I bet this son of a bitch
wins an Emmy.

24:52.367 --> 24:57.327
Amidst all the readily
identifiable dissimilarities
between our human race

24:57.413 --> 25:00.120
and the alien visitors we've
been learning about,

25:00.208 --> 25:03.291
occasionally on these
startling videotapes,

25:03.378 --> 25:07.212
we come upon a moment that
seemingly unites us in spirit

25:07.298 --> 25:10.290
across endless chasms of space.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.421
It's okay.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.843
It's okay.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.054
It's okay.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.642
Bobby:
Is that a dead rat?

25:18.726 --> 25:20.182
Mm.

25:21.396 --> 25:24.058
He was my friend.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.733
( sniffles ):
W-we were just playing.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.187
( groans )

25:33.282 --> 25:37.446
He just stopped outside
the kitchen to eat something
and just...

25:39.622 --> 25:41.328
It's okay.

25:41.416 --> 25:45.659
Olivia:
The more time you spend with
Chiana and the others,

25:45.753 --> 25:51.749
the more you realize, with
incredible joy and relief that
we're not that dissimilar.

25:51.843 --> 25:54.334
Bobby:
What are you doing?

25:54.429 --> 25:57.091
I am absorbing beauty.

25:57.181 --> 25:59.137
You like Earth?

25:59.225 --> 26:02.262
I didn't think I did
at first, but I'm, uh,

26:02.353 --> 26:05.561
beginning to realize it's one of
the better places I've visited.

26:05.648 --> 26:10.142
Reminds me of my own planet
about 10,000 cycles ago.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.194
It was meant to be
undisciplined and adventurous.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.771
Fletcher:
Imagine.

26:14.866 --> 26:17.198
Think of how we view ourselves.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.823
A sophisticated culture,
growing, evolving.

26:20.913 --> 26:26.499
Then look how he views us,
undisciplined and adventurous.

26:26.586 --> 26:30.670
As time goes on, I predict
we'll be forced to realign

26:30.757 --> 26:33.749
every concept by which
we judge ourselves.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.300
They say you're a
great warrior.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.252
That's an accident of birth.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.884
There are better things
to do with your life.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.387
Ever kill anyone with
your tongue?

26:46.230 --> 26:49.017
Bobby...

26:49.108 --> 26:53.442
my tongue contains
adaptive venom.

26:53.529 --> 26:57.818
The victim takes in only enough
to lose consciousness.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.945
No one dies.

27:00.036 --> 27:00.991
Can I see it?

27:01.078 --> 27:02.067
No.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.620
Look, you see only differences.

27:04.707 --> 27:07.039
Tentacles, a tongue with venom.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.993
Everything about him
screams "alien."

27:10.087 --> 27:15.172
Now, close your eyes. Listen.

27:15.259 --> 27:18.877
General Ka D'Argo could very
easily be you or me.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.804
Bobby:
I thought you were
great on Letterman.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.931
Yeah, thanks. Um...

27:25.019 --> 27:29.262
yeah, I thought everyone was
laughing with me, so...

27:29.357 --> 27:33.646
For every instant when we may
lulled into accepting these
alien visitors

27:33.736 --> 27:38.947
as perhaps nothing more than
peculiar looking versions of
people we know here on Earth,

27:39.033 --> 27:42.696
there comes another moment on
these startling videotapes

27:42.787 --> 27:47.326
that seemingly shatters any
illusion of potential
coexistence.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.201
Bobby:
Please.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.203
No.
-Why not?

27:50.294 --> 27:53.957
For the same reasons that I've
been saying to you ad nauseum.

27:54.048 --> 27:55.549
Why is it so important?

27:55.633 --> 27:57.715
Because I like stuff like that.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.292
It's cool.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.503
Tell me it's not cool.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.010
It's cool. Cool.

28:06.602 --> 28:10.186
All right. Now, you promise
not to tell anyone?

28:10.273 --> 28:13.515
I promise.
-Okay.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.100
All right, turn the camera off.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.481
Okay. It's off.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.279
All right, you ready?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.982
(hisses)
(grunt and thud)

28:26.414 --> 28:29.577
Uh, Noranti, could you
get down here?

28:29.667 --> 28:32.283
Dr. Alderson:
I would have to say that we
need to prevent these sorts of encounters

28:32.378 --> 28:34.994
from happening outside a
research facility.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.956
Every experience is a
learning experience.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.883
The boy did not die.
He is wiser.

28:40.970 --> 28:47.261
The aliens cannot have the run
of our planet until we know
more about their psychology.

28:47.351 --> 28:50.184
What is this for?
-Uh, your lips.

28:50.271 --> 28:56.312
Um, I ask because my grandfather
says you're a great bellwether
on who we are as a species.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.690
Bull... wether.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.192
Do males... do males put
these on their faces?

29:02.283 --> 29:04.444
Uh, in my family?

29:04.535 --> 29:07.242
Only a second cousin
no one talks about.

29:07.330 --> 29:08.536
Waste.

29:08.623 --> 29:10.454
Makeup?

29:10.541 --> 29:13.248
Why... why are there
so many colors?

29:13.336 --> 29:17.170
Chanderpaul:
One must look past the physical
and see the spiritual side.

29:17.256 --> 29:22.091
She condemns materialism and
waste, a highly evolved outlook.

29:22.178 --> 29:25.011
Remembering for a moment her
otherworldly origins,

29:25.097 --> 29:29.887
Chiana's perspective is
consistent, well-thought-out
and in my view, correct.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.808
I've seen water rooms
like this...

29:31.896 --> 29:34.308
( laughs )

29:34.398 --> 29:38.232
...that have... that have
two toilets,

29:38.319 --> 29:41.903
two showers, a sink, and a tub.

29:41.989 --> 29:46.449
And a bubbling tub. Bubbling...
(Rygel sighs)

29:46.535 --> 29:50.244
How many places do you need
water to come from?

29:50.331 --> 29:52.663
You could wash up in the toilet.
-Oh, no way!

29:52.750 --> 29:55.958
See? It's clean.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.706
Bobby:
Ugh!

30:00.716 --> 30:02.331
What are you looking at?

30:02.426 --> 30:06.260
What we're seeing is a very
young disturbed, alien girl.

30:06.347 --> 30:09.555
Clearly a passionate, though
troubled young lady.

30:09.642 --> 30:13.681
This young woman should not
be allowed near any
impressionable child.

30:13.771 --> 30:17.855
She is clearly dangerous,
troubled and a bad influence.

30:17.942 --> 30:20.149
Dr. Alderson:
| defy anyone...

30:20.236 --> 30:22.773
(sighs)

30:22.863 --> 30:26.151
I'm sick of this popcorn.

30:26.242 --> 30:29.359
I'm sick of those humans.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.870
| just feel sorry for Crichton.

30:34.291 --> 30:37.624
Noranti gave me this stuff
that'll help him sleep.

30:37.712 --> 30:39.168
You think I should go find him?

30:39.255 --> 30:41.337
No, give it to me.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.133
Okay, ready?

30:47.221 --> 30:49.303
( blowing )
( inhales )

30:50.182 --> 30:53.515
Mmm. Feel sorry for Aeryn.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.514
He'll get over it.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.937
ldon't think he will, Ryg.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.187
You know, no matter how
long it takes.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.860
ldon't think he'll lose hope.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.155
Aeryn:
I believe Katratzi to be
some sort of base.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.827
Highly guarded.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.831
They wouldn't have taken Grayza
anywhere less secure.

31:22.465 --> 31:23.375
Bobby:
Who's winning?

31:23.466 --> 31:25.297
Me.
-I mean the game.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.624
Who cares?!

31:26.719 --> 31:28.459
You sure got yourself a
lot ofjunk food.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.169
Too bad. Get your own.

31:30.264 --> 31:31.765
What do you like best on Earth?

31:31.849 --> 31:33.840
Sugar. Anything with sugar.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.720
Don't you have sugar
where you come from?

31:35.811 --> 31:37.142
Yes, but it's used as a poison.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.481
Here, you can get it
everywhere. ( laughs)

31:39.565 --> 31:40.930
What else do you like?

31:41.025 --> 31:44.768
Ah, grease, fat.
Love these things.

31:44.862 --> 31:48.571
I know you'll think I'm joking
but he seems to understand
our culture

31:48.657 --> 31:51.194
better than we're
willing to admit.

31:51.285 --> 31:57.201
As an outsider, his views are a
prismatic tool for us to
perhaps examine ourselves.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.202
So all in all you could
live here?

31:59.293 --> 32:01.284
As long as I get to
keep my slaves.

32:01.378 --> 32:04.415
They're servants. They get paid.
You don't own them.

32:04.507 --> 32:06.338
What? You're kidding.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.881
They come running when I call.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.708
The government wants you
to feel at home.

32:09.804 --> 32:12.090
Then give me slaves.

32:12.181 --> 32:14.968
Okay. Besides eating, what's
your favorite thing to do?

32:15.059 --> 32:16.265
Uh, gamble.

32:16.352 --> 32:18.434
You can do it over the phone.

32:18.521 --> 32:21.308
You can call females, too.

32:21.398 --> 32:24.982
"1-900-SLUT GIRL."

32:25.069 --> 32:28.436
I was privileged to have
interviewed the Dominar
during his visit.

32:28.531 --> 32:31.489
Despite what I'm sure many
viewers are thinking,

32:31.575 --> 32:36.285
this is the ruler of over
600 billion subjects.

32:36.372 --> 32:39.330
He must be doing
something right.

32:39.416 --> 32:43.955
A little-known fact about
this, the biggest story
of the new millennium.

32:44.046 --> 32:47.664
There is at least one person
who makes a credible claim

32:47.758 --> 32:50.625
that our alien visitors have
been here before.

32:50.719 --> 32:56.635
In 1985, to be exact, mere
months before the Challenger
space shuttle disaster.

32:56.725 --> 33:01.219
We welcome Robert Schelmacher,
former sheriff of Orlando.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.474
Still sheriff. Always sheriff.

33:03.566 --> 33:06.478
No alien's gonna run me
off my job.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.150
Okay, Sheriff.

33:08.237 --> 33:13.903
Suppose you start by telling us
what happened down in Florida
back in 1985.

33:14.785 --> 33:17.276
They were here. All of 'em.

33:17.371 --> 33:18.156
Mmm.

33:18.247 --> 33:22.911
Ears. Tentacles. Cher.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.420
Cher?

33:25.504 --> 33:27.244
Cher.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.125
And this one.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.249
Their leader.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.253
We're all aware of the
troubled among us,

33:36.348 --> 33:40.261
attention seekers and outright
criminals who have attempted
to fabricate stories

33:40.352 --> 33:43.389
and cash in on this
alien visitation.

33:43.480 --> 33:50.067
In the Sheriff's defense,
way back in 1985, he filed
a report with the FBI,

33:50.154 --> 33:53.988
giving what we now realize are
fairly accurate descriptions

33:54.074 --> 34:00.616
of General D'Argo, Noranti,
Officer Sun, and Dominar Rygel.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.326
The files remain sealed,

34:03.417 --> 34:08.081
and no one in government
will speak of their contents
on the record.

34:08.172 --> 34:12.256
Can you tell us what you
remember of that time, Sheriff?

34:12.343 --> 34:15.085
First they kidnapped our
astronaut, the young Crichton.

34:15.179 --> 34:19.218
Then they sabotaged our
space shuttle program,
they set it back.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.890
They grounded us.

34:21.977 --> 34:24.309
Next came the truly most
insidious part,

34:24.396 --> 34:29.481
and that was installing
tiny microchips in each
of our brains. Oh...

34:31.612 --> 34:34.900
But that keeps the signals out.

34:34.990 --> 34:39.529
And, uh, what do you think the
signals are telling us?

34:41.080 --> 34:45.039
"Eat... fatty... foods."

34:45.125 --> 34:48.993
You see this puny little alien
talking about fat?

34:49.088 --> 34:50.498
That's our downfall.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.830
In what way, Sheriff?

34:52.925 --> 34:55.337
Come on, man. Catch on to this.

34:55.427 --> 34:59.591
We get fat, we can't move,
they defeat us.

34:59.682 --> 35:02.890
It's that easy to
take over a world.

35:02.977 --> 35:07.596
You've spent a portion of
the last 18 years in an
institution, have you not?

35:07.690 --> 35:10.181
Well, most of it. So what?
I saw them. They were here.

35:10.276 --> 35:13.359
And I know their plan.
But look at me.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.357
Lean. Undefeatable.

35:16.448 --> 35:20.111
Yes, now, whatever you
believe there is credible
evidence that we...

35:20.202 --> 35:22.739
-Vegetables.
...we have been visited
by these same aliens

35:22.830 --> 35:25.162
-Fruits. No saturated fat.
...in the past.

35:25.249 --> 35:29.834
The task will now be to find
out why. Thank you, Sheriff.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.252
There's more. We'll be back.

35:35.426 --> 35:36.962
You wanna dance?

35:37.052 --> 35:38.838
Bobby:
Oh, I'm not very good.
-Oh, come on.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.169
(chuckling)

35:42.141 --> 35:45.975
And driving, and driving,
and reverse, reverse...

35:46.061 --> 35:47.562
(laughing)

35:49.398 --> 35:51.605
Bobby, what do you
think of sex?

35:51.692 --> 35:52.977
Uh, what?

35:53.068 --> 35:54.729
Sex.
-Why are you asking me?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.401
Oh, just curious.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.230
I haven't had it yet.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.987
What, you haven't had it?!

36:02.077 --> 36:04.159
Are you serious?
How old are you?

36:04.246 --> 36:05.326
Thirteen.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.871
Thirteen. Well, what are
you waiting for?

36:07.958 --> 36:10.370
It's against the law.

36:11.128 --> 36:12.334
To have sex?

36:12.421 --> 36:14.002
At 13.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.627
Well, that's frelled.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.504
Who cares when you have it?

36:19.595 --> 36:20.835
My mom.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.635
Whoa. Okay.

36:22.723 --> 36:26.841
So, why are all the little girls
wearing all those clothes?

36:26.935 --> 36:30.848
Because they see it on the TV
and in the magazines.

36:30.939 --> 36:34.227
But somebody sold them
the clothes,

36:34.318 --> 36:38.277
so somebody wants them
to have sex.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.275
I never thought of it
like that.

36:40.366 --> 36:41.947
(laughing)

36:42.034 --> 36:46.824
Oh, there is an innocence about
her that is wonderfully
contagious.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.825
Father Vosko:
Outrageous and disgusting.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.827
The boy is only 13.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.159
Is that what we want our
youth exposed to?

36:53.253 --> 36:57.292
Oh, please. Don't make more
out of that than is there.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.123
She was not coming on to Bobby.

36:59.218 --> 37:02.927
I'm not a psychologist, but
that's rather innocent, hmm?

37:03.013 --> 37:06.130
I mean, you get more juice
from Dawson's Creek.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.511
Bobby:
Okay, it's working.
What did you wanna show me?

37:08.602 --> 37:17.226
Sikozu:
Curiosity causes you to look in
unexpected places, and find unexpected rewards.

37:17.653 --> 37:18.859
Have a go.

37:18.946 --> 37:21.904
( beeps )
Uh, Uncle John?

37:22.491 --> 37:24.823
Commander John Crichton?

37:24.910 --> 37:27.868
Crichton:
Bobby. What the hell you
doing with the Comms?

37:27.955 --> 37:31.072
Uh, Sikozu let me try it.
Where are you?

37:31.166 --> 37:33.623
Australia. I'm working, Bobby.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.122
Wow, wow, wow!

37:36.213 --> 37:40.627
I met this young female and had
no idea she could defy gravity.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.753
I am truly astounded.

37:42.845 --> 37:46.508
In my opinion, there is nothing
about the alien Sikozu

37:46.598 --> 37:50.056
that is not infused with
anger and disdain.

37:50.144 --> 37:52.430
E.T. she is not.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.432
Pilot?
-Yes, Sikozu?

37:54.523 --> 37:56.104
Do you see any value in
us continuing?

37:56.191 --> 38:00.730
Despite my strong feelings
for Officer Sun,
I'm afraid I do not.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.607
I will tell Crichton.

38:02.698 --> 38:04.484
Tell me what?

38:05.993 --> 38:08.109
We cannot find Aeryn.

38:08.203 --> 38:13.038
We cannot locate this Katratzi.
No one has even heard the name.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.286
I've heard it.

38:16.253 --> 38:18.084
You have heard it.

38:18.172 --> 38:22.131
Someone said it on this ship.
-No, I heard it on the planet
where we left Aeryn.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.833
What are you not telling me?

38:24.928 --> 38:26.543
I'm telling you everything.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.890
You're lying. You're not
telling me.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.805
You know the name Katratzi.
-l have had enough of your...

38:30.893 --> 38:33.100
You have been nothing but lying
from the moment you got on
board this ship...

38:33.187 --> 38:36.930
-I do not know!
Sputnik, and I will not
let Aeryn die!

38:37.024 --> 38:38.184
Katratzi!

38:38.275 --> 38:40.982
It is not my providence if
she lives or dies.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.275
Katratzi!

38:42.362 --> 38:43.943
It is not my fault if
she lives or dies.

38:44.031 --> 38:47.774
Katratzi!
-And it is not my will if
she lives or dies!

38:47.868 --> 38:51.235
Crichton, listen to yourself!

38:51.330 --> 38:54.163
Everything lives and
everything dies,

38:54.249 --> 38:58.162
whether you wish it to or not,
and you have to deal with it!

38:58.253 --> 39:03.668
(Sikozu singing a
melody on TV )

39:21.735 --> 39:24.397
(rewinding)

39:25.405 --> 39:27.487
(singing)

39:28.784 --> 39:30.570
I can't...
-Pull yourself together!

39:35.165 --> 39:37.201
You! You shoot me!

39:37.292 --> 39:39.624
Shoot now!
-You're comin' back, Stark?

39:39.711 --> 39:41.247
Katratzi.

39:45.342 --> 39:46.297
What?

39:47.761 --> 39:50.252
I believe Katratzi to be
some sort of base.

39:50.347 --> 39:51.803
Highly guarded.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.006
They wouldn't have taken Grayza
anywhere less secure.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.386
Katratzi.

40:01.525 --> 40:02.935
Sorry.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.531
That son of a bitch
deserves an Emmy.

40:14.288 --> 40:15.994
(turns off TV)

40:29.219 --> 40:32.006
(deep rumbling)

40:34.266 --> 40:37.975
Pilot, do you still know
the location of that
wormhole to Earth?

40:39.354 --> 40:41.219
Could you set a course please?

40:41.315 --> 40:44.557
I'll have to ask the Captain.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.106
D'Argo?

40:49.197 --> 40:50.983
John.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.531
Aeryn.

40:55.329 --> 40:58.196
Wormholes? Earth? What?

40:58.290 --> 41:01.032
Look, it's complicated.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.287
I understand that. Pilot...

41:03.378 --> 41:06.290
Pilot:
I need not remind you that
Moya is now phobic regarding wormholes.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.042
Crichton:
You don't have to go
all the way.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.499
Just get me close enough so that
I can make it in my module.

41:10.594 --> 41:13.006
John, you are not going
back to Earth.

41:14.598 --> 41:16.429
No, I'm not.

41:19.311 --> 41:21.597
It's complicated.

41:21.688 --> 41:27.103
Monroe:
We need to maintain clarity of
thought, healthy skepticism, an aggressive inquisitiveness.

41:27.194 --> 41:32.063
To that end, we at this network
call upon the government

41:32.157 --> 41:36.400
to release all files pertaining
to Officer Schelmacher's
aHegaﬂons

41:36.495 --> 41:40.659
of past visitation and any
other related matter.

41:40.749 --> 41:46.870
When the aliens return, and
they will, we also urge an
aggressive quarantine

41:46.963 --> 41:50.046
until the true nature of their
presence is ascertained.

41:50.133 --> 41:54.422
Recall that the same
extraterrestrials we
behold with wonder

41:54.513 --> 41:57.550
as they learn our language
and dance to our music,

41:57.641 --> 42:03.352
also bear weapons, as well
as potential illness which
could destroy us.

42:04.272 --> 42:08.015
Alien visitation is a reality.

42:08.110 --> 42:12.274
They've been here once and we
seem to have dodged the bullet.

42:12.364 --> 42:17.404
The truth is, can we be as
certain the next time?

42:21.415 --> 42:23.576
I thank you for being with us.

42:23.667 --> 42:26.079
There will be more in the
days and weeks ahead.

42:26.169 --> 42:32.711
But for now, from New York,
this is R. Wilson Monroe
saying good night.

42:44.855 --> 42:47.221
Crichton:
You set me up.

42:49.651 --> 42:51.607
Not that I care.

42:56.742 --> 43:00.985
I don't care about much.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.197
War.

43:06.168 --> 43:07.704
Death.

43:08.628 --> 43:10.539
Wormholes.

43:13.717 --> 43:16.629
I don't care about the things
you care about.

43:18.638 --> 43:20.299
Peacekeepers rule the Scarrans.

43:20.390 --> 43:23.177
The Scarrans rule
the Peacekeepers.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.975
Let them rule together,
put your ass in a cage.

43:26.855 --> 43:31.019
I care about one thing.

43:34.446 --> 43:36.186
One.

43:38.492 --> 43:42.326
God have mercy on my soul.

43:47.667 --> 43:50.329
lthink...

43:50.420 --> 43:54.083
I'm gonna need your help,

43:54.174 --> 43:57.541
Mr. Scarran half-breed,

43:58.386 --> 44:01.469
to get Aeryn back.

44:04.351 --> 44:07.434
Help me get her...

44:09.231 --> 44:11.267
and I will give you wormholes.

44:15.111 --> 44:18.353
I have an idea of how to
find the Scarran base.

44:19.366 --> 44:23.359
Aeryn for wormholes.

44:27.165 --> 44:29.326
That's the deal.

45:06.371 --> 45:12.241
Monroe:
On our next special, you will
see footage of the carnage of Jack Crichton's Florida home,

45:12.335 --> 45:17.329
carnage that could only have
been caused by an alien,
but which one?

45:17.424 --> 45:23.090
And we'll explore the still
unexplained deaths of John
Crichton's best friend,

45:23.179 --> 45:26.216
Douglas "D.K." Knox and
his wife Laura.

45:26.308 --> 45:32.850
Their autopsies and death
records are sealed. The rumors
of alien involvement abound.

45:32.939 --> 45:35.772
All this and more, next time.

45:35.859 --> 45:37.815
We hope to see you then.
