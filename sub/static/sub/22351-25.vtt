00:01.990 --> 00:06.409
Previously on "Big Brother":
>> After a shocking double

00:06.410 --> 00:10.989
eviction sent Jackie home...
>> Julie: Jackie, you are

00:10.990 --> 00:11.990
evicted from the "Big Brother"
house.

00:11.991 --> 00:14.989
The house was left divided.

00:14.990 --> 00:19.989
James, Meg, John, and Becky on
one side, and Austin, Liz,

00:19.990 --> 00:22.989
Julia, Vanessa, and Steve on the
other.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.989
Sending Jackie home.

00:24.990 --> 00:26.989
Finally we have a shift in
power.

00:26.990 --> 00:31.829
A crucial head of household
competition left Liz as happy as

00:31.830 --> 00:33.989
a smiley-faced emoji.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.949
Congratulations, Liz.

00:35.950 --> 00:37.699
You are the new head of
household.

00:37.700 --> 00:43.989
After solidifying a new
alliance name... it seemed they

00:43.990 --> 00:45.409
had their target set.

00:45.410 --> 00:46.699
Backdoor Becky.

00:46.700 --> 00:50.989
I'm, like, phew.

00:50.990 --> 00:54.989
All right, she's willing to get
the blood on her hands and I

00:54.990 --> 00:56.539
didn't put her name out, she
did.

00:56.540 --> 01:01.989
But when beak aired some of
Vanessa's dirty laundry.

01:01.990 --> 01:05.829
When the plan was to backdoor
me, Vanessa knew about that,

01:05.830 --> 01:05.990
right?

01:05.990 --> 01:06.990
Yes.

01:06.991 --> 01:08.989
They considered turning on
one of their owns.

01:08.990 --> 01:11.989
It completely made he second
guess trusting her and all the

01:11.990 --> 01:13.989
information we've given her.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.989
Vanessa tried to make a side
deal with Johnny Mac.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.989
I want to help you in this
game.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.989
But when he dropped some
truth on her...

01:20.990 --> 01:23.989
I felt like I was bullied at
the time.

01:23.990 --> 01:26.989
To blame me for it is, like,
unfair.

01:26.990 --> 01:28.989
Vanessa threw Johnny under
the bus.

01:28.990 --> 01:33.989
I'm not entirely sure he
should just be a pawn after this

01:33.990 --> 01:34.830
conversation.

01:34.831 --> 01:36.409
And the dentist caught her
red handed.

01:36.410 --> 01:38.989
We were just talking and it
looked fishy.

01:38.990 --> 01:39.120
Who.

01:39.120 --> 01:39.990
And you me?

01:39.990 --> 01:40.990
What do you mean?

01:40.991 --> 01:45.989
At the nomination ceremony,
Liz decided not to take a shot

01:45.990 --> 01:45.991
at Vanessa.

01:45.991 --> 01:50.989
I have nominated you, Becky,
and you, Johnny Mac,.

01:50.990 --> 01:54.989
Tonight, will the power of
veto save either John or Becky?

01:54.990 --> 01:57.989
Plus, will Austin and the twins
make a power play against the

01:57.990 --> 01:58.700
the poker player?

01:58.701 --> 01:59.989
We are supposed to be a team.

01:59.990 --> 02:01.119
It's like, what happened?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.989
And get ready to rock.

02:02.990 --> 02:07.829
It's the world premiere of oteb,
the rockin' roll.

02:07.830 --> 02:08.410
All right!

02:08.411 --> 02:13.989
All this right now on "big
brother."

02:13.990 --> 02:18.989
Whoa!

02:18.990 --> 02:19.990
Bull's-eye.

02:55.410 --> 03:00.989
This nomination ceremony is
adjourn.

03:00.990 --> 03:03.699
John and Becky are on the
block this week, and although

03:03.700 --> 03:07.989
those are great options, I could
very easily make a big move and

03:07.990 --> 03:08.290
backdoor Vanessa.

03:08.291 --> 03:11.539
But I don't know what I'm going
to do.

03:11.540 --> 03:15.989
I'm on the block yet again in
this house, but if a train can't

03:15.990 --> 03:21.119
stop me, then I highly doubt
that these houseguests can.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.989
So I'm nominated, and I'm
sitting next to the last person

03:24.990 --> 03:29.989
in the house that I want to be
sitting next to, but this veto

03:29.990 --> 03:30.540
competition is huge.

03:30.541 --> 03:34.989
I need to win this thing and
pull myself down, make sure I

03:34.990 --> 03:36.989
stay here another week and get
the job done and get Vanessa out

03:36.990 --> 03:42.989
of here.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.989
I'm trying to give Johnny Mac
a hug to console him, and I'm

03:46.990 --> 03:49.989
getting the death stare.

03:49.990 --> 03:49.991
Bro.

03:49.991 --> 03:50.990
What did I do to you?

03:50.990 --> 03:51.990
We never talked game.

03:51.991 --> 03:53.289
You made no deal with me.

03:53.290 --> 03:59.990
And I didn't put you up!

04:02.120 --> 04:06.989
I'm not wild about the way
things ended in my earlier

04:06.990 --> 04:07.990
conversation with John.

04:07.991 --> 04:10.989
I want to smooth things over and
just let him know I've let go of

04:10.990 --> 04:12.989
things, and hopefully he has,
too.

04:12.990 --> 04:13.830
Don't worry.

04:13.831 --> 04:14.989
You're not going home.

04:14.990 --> 04:16.989
You have nothing to worry about.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.989
It's a tough spot, but if anyone
can win a veto, it's you, and if

04:19.990 --> 04:26.119
it comes down to eviction I tile
heil doubt you will be going

04:26.120 --> 04:26.950
home.

04:26.951 --> 04:29.989
I was going up to find out, by
the way, when you walked in.

04:29.990 --> 04:30.999
Yeah, I was scared.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.949
I'm a straight shooter.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.989
I told you pii will tell you if
I'm upset.

04:35.990 --> 04:39.989
You're up there looking out
for me, Vanessa, huh?

04:39.990 --> 04:43.989
By "looking out" do you mean
making sure my fasters in are

04:43.990 --> 04:45.989
securely attached to the
railroad track when the train

04:45.990 --> 04:45.991
comes?

04:45.991 --> 04:47.989
I just want to take a nap.

04:47.990 --> 04:48.540
Damn it!

04:48.541 --> 04:52.989
In fact, I'd like the whole
house to know you are, like, my

04:52.990 --> 04:56.989
sworn enemy and you are the only
one I will come after.

04:56.990 --> 05:04.290
I'll take a nap now.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.989
He just looked at me like he
wanted to kill me.

05:09.990 --> 05:13.989
He just gave me a look like he
was so pissed at me.

05:13.990 --> 05:13.991
Why you?

05:13.991 --> 05:15.989
He hate us all.

05:15.990 --> 05:16.990
I want to yell at him.

05:16.991 --> 05:19.989
You're walking around this house
like you're depressed.

05:19.990 --> 05:21.989
Why don't you make a deal with
us?

05:21.990 --> 05:24.999
We were always on the same side
with Shelli and Clay and you

05:25.000 --> 05:25.990
won't come to us.

05:25.991 --> 05:27.119
He wouldn't look at me.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.289
He doesn't care what you're
going to say.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.989
Who wouldn't even look at
you?

05:31.990 --> 05:32.990
Johnny Mac.

05:32.991 --> 05:37.990
Whatever.

05:42.990 --> 05:45.989
I have to win veto or I'm
going home.

05:45.990 --> 05:50.699
You need to stop fighting
with Vanessa.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.989
You're not going home this week.

05:51.990 --> 05:52.990
It's not going to happen.

05:52.991 --> 05:56.989
I don't think you'll go, but win
it anyways.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.289
Just get a good night's sleep.

05:58.290 --> 05:58.990
Yeah.

05:58.991 --> 06:00.989
And eat a good breakfast.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.119
Yeah.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.989
I really want to help John
out in this game because I know

06:05.990 --> 06:07.989
he's going to stay loyal for me.

06:07.990 --> 06:10.989
I'm trying to figure out why
John isn't close with the twins.

06:10.990 --> 06:13.119
What can I do to help him hi.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.989
You can come in.

06:15.990 --> 06:18.989
If Johnny Mac keeps acting
like this angry and moping

06:18.990 --> 06:20.989
around, I'm going to want him
gone.

06:20.990 --> 06:21.990
I'm scared of him now.

06:21.991 --> 06:24.539
I feel like he's very volatile.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.989
I mean, you guys are close.

06:26.990 --> 06:27.950
What do you think?

06:27.951 --> 06:29.119
I think he's very nervous.

06:29.120 --> 06:29.990
Why?

06:29.991 --> 06:31.989
Because he feels like he's
alone.

06:31.990 --> 06:35.989
But instead he's acting angry
and it's just not rubbing me the

06:35.990 --> 06:35.991
right way.

06:35.991 --> 06:38.949
Well, how much do you guys
talk to him?

06:38.950 --> 06:39.989
Not that much.

06:39.990 --> 06:43.989
That's all he would need to
do is say I want to work with

06:43.990 --> 06:45.539
you guys.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.539
I'm a trustworthy person.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.989
We were going to him for that.

06:48.990 --> 06:50.989
We can bring him into the fold.

06:50.990 --> 06:56.989
If we keep him, will he not
come after us if he wins?

06:56.990 --> 06:58.119
That's what it ams can down to.

06:58.120 --> 07:06.120
We just want to know where he
stand.

07:09.990 --> 07:14.990
Hey, what's up?

07:23.990 --> 07:24.990
No.

07:24.991 --> 07:30.989
Starting Tuesday, just all
unraveled.

07:30.990 --> 07:30.991
It flipped.

07:30.991 --> 07:33.989
I had all the votes I needed.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.989
Vanessa stayed in the game.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.989
And Jackie leaves.

07:38.990 --> 07:43.289
And the people I've been super
close with.

07:43.290 --> 07:46.989
Now, we're the the ones stuck
up there.

07:46.990 --> 07:54.990
From the top to the block.

07:55.990 --> 07:56.990
Ewww!

07:56.991 --> 08:00.989
I feel like that's the
16th century, the man in the

08:00.990 --> 08:01.990
iron mask here.

08:01.990 --> 08:02.990
What the heck!

08:02.990 --> 08:03.990
It's for you.

08:03.990 --> 08:04.990
I'm trying to be pretty.

08:04.991 --> 08:08.989
It's been a rough week so far,
so I just wanted to do a little

08:08.990 --> 08:12.989
bit of pampering and enjoy being
the queen of this house.

08:12.990 --> 08:13.990
What the ( Bleep )!

08:13.990 --> 08:14.700
What's happening.

08:14.701 --> 08:19.989
Julia, it hurt so bad.

08:19.990 --> 08:20.990
Oh!

08:20.990 --> 08:21.990
It hurts.

08:21.990 --> 08:22.990
It really hurts.

08:22.990 --> 08:23.990
Oh, my God.

08:23.991 --> 08:25.989
You can just pull really
fast?

08:25.990 --> 08:26.990
I want to do it.

08:26.991 --> 08:31.989
But don't get it to her
eyebrow really fast because you

08:31.990 --> 08:33.999
could rip out all her eyebrow.

08:34.000 --> 08:34.990
Oh!

08:34.991 --> 08:38.989
You look like batgirl.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.949
Ow!

08:40.950 --> 08:45.989
It's like you're coming out
of the black lagoon.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.989
Ow!

08:47.990 --> 08:49.989
Oh!

08:49.990 --> 08:50.830
Oooh!

08:50.830 --> 08:50.990
Oh!

08:50.990 --> 08:51.830
Oh, my God!

08:51.831 --> 08:58.119
This hurts so bad!

08:58.120 --> 09:01.989
These nominations are all
about seeing how people react.

09:01.990 --> 09:02.990
This week, yeah.

09:02.991 --> 09:06.989
Because we can watch what
does Johnny Mac do?

09:06.990 --> 09:08.989
What does Becky do?

09:08.990 --> 09:10.989
And what does Vanessa do?

09:10.990 --> 09:13.989
We should talk to him right now.

09:13.990 --> 09:15.989
He's sitting right there.

09:15.990 --> 09:20.949
I need to speak to Johnny Mac
pronto because he is an enigma

09:20.950 --> 09:20.990
in this game.

09:20.991 --> 09:25.989
We want to know who he's
targeting and where his head is

09:25.990 --> 09:25.991
at.

09:25.991 --> 09:28.989
Maybe he is someone that we can
trust.

09:28.990 --> 09:28.993
- Johnny.
- >> Yeah.

09:28.993 --> 09:31.989
When you're done beating
Steve can you come in and talk

09:31.990 --> 09:32.990
to us for a second?

09:32.991 --> 09:36.989
Yes, I'd love to.

09:36.990 --> 09:37.990
( Knocking ).

09:37.990 --> 09:38.990
Come in!

09:38.990 --> 09:39.990
Hello.

09:39.991 --> 09:41.989
Hey, man.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.539
He's got some tricks there.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.999
He's very sneaky.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
I go for all the pieces which
is probably bad.

09:57.990 --> 09:58.700
He just goes for the kill.

09:58.700 --> 09:58.990
Finally.

09:58.990 --> 09:58.991
We want to talk to you.

09:58.991 --> 09:59.990
Down to brass tacks.

09:59.990 --> 10:00.990
Like, there's been a lot of
weird ( Bleep ) About Vanessa

10:00.990 --> 10:01.700
the last few weeks, man.

10:01.700 --> 10:01.990
Yeah.

10:01.990 --> 10:02.990
Something happened today and
you were going to talk to us

10:02.991 --> 10:04.989
because Vanessa ran up here
trying to tell us what was going

10:04.990 --> 10:04.991
on.

10:04.991 --> 10:08.989
First of all he says, is she
putting me up?

10:08.990 --> 10:09.990
And I was like I don't know.

10:09.991 --> 10:11.989
And he's like, I know I'm going
up.

10:11.990 --> 10:14.829
And he has, like, an attitude.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.989
And I'm trying to be nice to
him.

10:16.990 --> 10:18.989
And he's giving me attitude.

10:18.990 --> 10:21.989
I'm not sure he should just be a
pawn.

10:21.990 --> 10:24.989
She said I'm just making sure
you're not going up on the block

10:24.990 --> 10:25.990
as a target.

10:25.990 --> 10:26.990
Shut up!

10:26.991 --> 10:30.989
I started playing dumb
because I didn't know what to

10:30.990 --> 10:30.991
do.

10:30.991 --> 10:32.989
She's going to blow up my game
fidon't.

10:32.990 --> 10:35.289
I've been after Vanessa for a
while now.

10:35.290 --> 10:37.989
I just haven't been telling
anyone.

10:37.990 --> 10:40.989
I have held all this in because
everyone loves Vanessa.

10:40.990 --> 10:41.990
This is between us.

10:41.990 --> 10:41.991
Trust me.

10:41.991 --> 10:44.989
I already, like, feel like
she blows up.

10:44.990 --> 10:45.990
Yes.

10:45.991 --> 10:48.289
She's just... like, words.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.989
She spins things... I don't
get the paranoia.

10:50.990 --> 10:54.989
I know people think I'm super
close to her and stuff, but the

10:54.990 --> 10:59.539
way she's playing her game is
pissing me off.

10:59.540 --> 11:04.949
Every single person that has
had a blow-up with her has gone

11:04.950 --> 11:04.988
home.

11:04.989 --> 11:05.989
She was going to backdoor me.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.949
She was going to backdoor
him.

11:07.950 --> 11:09.989
Because of one with Jason.

11:09.990 --> 11:12.989
Yeah.

11:12.990 --> 11:15.989
Austin and Liz are hearing me
out.

11:15.990 --> 11:19.829
Getting in with these two will
not only ensure my safety but

11:19.830 --> 11:21.989
put a big target on Vanessa and
I want to take her down.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.989
This is a win-win situation.

11:23.990 --> 11:26.119
Like going balls to the walls in
the h.O.H.S.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.539
I want to get it done.

11:27.540 --> 11:31.989
I want the first member of the
jury to be one I was proud of,

11:31.990 --> 11:31.991
you know.

11:31.991 --> 11:36.989
Honestly, that's really great
to know, and that, like, really

11:36.990 --> 11:38.989

>> because we were thinking

11:38.990 --> 11:41.989
she's making all these deals
with you.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.989
We were scared.

11:43.990 --> 11:44.990
And she's just worrying about
herself.

11:44.991 --> 11:46.989
I was not afraid to break
them.

11:46.990 --> 11:47.700
Excellent.

11:47.701 --> 11:50.989
Here we go again, all these
people are talking about

11:50.989 --> 11:51.540
First tfs Becky.

11:51.541 --> 11:54.989
Now it's vaek.

11:54.990 --> 11:55.990
Johnny Mac.

11:55.991 --> 11:57.989
I've had my doubts about
Vanessa.

11:57.990 --> 12:00.989
Now John giving me this
information makes he think he is

12:00.990 --> 12:03.989
definitely someone we can work
itw.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.699
It's like the stars are aligned.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.989
We don't want you to go home.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.989
There's still a veto to be
played.

12:09.990 --> 12:14.989
There's a lot left, whoever gets
her eviction is like a God.

12:14.990 --> 12:15.990
We're under her.

12:15.991 --> 12:17.990
Yeah.

12:33.990 --> 12:40.990
What are you doing?

12:51.990 --> 12:58.989
That's actually very
impressive.

12:58.990 --> 13:01.989
James!

13:01.990 --> 13:03.989
Who is in here?

13:03.990 --> 13:11.990
I literally cannot see.

13:12.290 --> 13:19.989

see.

13:19.990 --> 13:26.989

13:26.990 --> 13:28.989
Oh, my God!

13:28.990 --> 13:30.989

13:30.990 --> 13:33.989
Who's in here?

13:33.990 --> 13:39.989
Aarhhh!

13:39.990 --> 13:40.990
I was terrified, seriously.

13:40.990 --> 13:41.990
It's okay!

13:41.991 --> 13:49.991
I was like...
>> James!

13:52.700 --> 13:52.990
Oh!

13:52.990 --> 13:53.990
Hey, everyone!

13:53.991 --> 14:01.991
It's time to pick players for
the veto competition.

14:02.990 --> 14:05.999
Only six people will participate
in the veto competition.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.989
The head of household, the two
nominees, and three other

14:08.990 --> 14:11.989
players selected by random draw.

14:11.990 --> 14:15.989
Will the nominees please join me
up here?

14:15.990 --> 14:19.539
So, John and Becky are my
targets on the block, but

14:19.540 --> 14:20.989
Vanessa is starting to go on my
radar, too.

14:20.990 --> 14:24.989
I'm hoping to pick either Austin
or Julia to play in the veto

14:24.990 --> 14:27.989
competition so we can keep all
the power this week and I can

14:27.990 --> 14:29.949
just make my decision later.

14:29.950 --> 14:35.999
As h.O.H., I will pick first.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.999
Houseguest choice!

14:38.000 --> 14:40.989
I choose Austin!

14:40.990 --> 14:48.989

14:48.990 --> 14:50.989
Yup.

15:13.990 --> 15:16.989

15:16.990 --> 15:18.989
I'm starting to get angry.

15:18.990 --> 15:21.989
"Big Brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

15:21.990 --> 15:22.120
begin.

15:22.120 --> 15:22.990
Good luck.

15:22.991 --> 15:30.991

>> I'm sad.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.989
Why don't I ever get picked?

15:33.990 --> 15:34.990
It's not fair.

15:34.991 --> 15:37.989
I wish you would have picked
me because it's not fair.

15:37.990 --> 15:41.119

15:41.120 --> 15:43.989

loyalties?

look pretty today.

16:24.990 --> 16:30.539
I know I got you guys.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.989
I don't care if I win or not,
basically.

16:33.990 --> 16:35.989
Throwing comps is nothing new to
me.

16:35.990 --> 16:37.989
I've been doing it since week
two.

16:37.990 --> 16:40.989
It's a little risky to be
sitting on the block on

16:40.990 --> 16:43.989
Thursday, but I think it's going
to pay off because this is going

16:43.990 --> 16:46.989
to just show Austin and Liz,
like, I trust you guys.

16:46.990 --> 16:47.990
I want to work with you.

16:47.991 --> 16:55.991
We'll talk more after.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.289
There he is.

17:07.290 --> 17:07.990
I know.

17:07.991 --> 17:10.539
I need to stop what?

17:10.540 --> 17:12.989
Johnny Mac just told me he's
going to throw it to me.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.289
He said that?

17:14.290 --> 17:14.990
Uh-huh.

17:14.990 --> 17:15.990
He's a good guy.

17:15.990 --> 17:16.990

17:16.990 --> 17:17.990
Tuna.

17:17.991 --> 17:24.989
Oh!

17:24.990 --> 17:27.989
I'll feel really bad if he
throws it to you and then Becky

17:27.990 --> 17:28.990

17:28.991 --> 17:32.989

17:45.990 --> 17:50.989
The only way both of us stay
here is if you win it, so... I

17:50.990 --> 17:51.990
might throw it.

17:51.991 --> 17:53.989
I can't win.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.989
If you get lucky.

17:56.990 --> 17:58.989
I'm a one-hit wonder.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.989
I'm not a well-rounded player.

18:00.990 --> 18:05.989
Don't count yourself out yet.

18:05.990 --> 18:08.989
Meg and James are safe.

18:08.990 --> 18:11.989
Yup.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.699
They're not gonna play for me.

18:13.700 --> 18:14.120
Nope.

18:14.121 --> 18:15.409
I know.

18:15.410 --> 18:17.989
I'm most likely going home this
week, but...

I see butter coming down the
ramp, and all around the

backyard there's food, there's
pies, there are balloons.

19:05.990 --> 19:07.699
It's a giant mess.

correct butter, race back to me,

because in each round, there

on than there are players.

bring me the butter I ask for or

you bring me back the wrong
butter, you'll be eliminated.

( bleep ) Bat.

36:31.950 --> 36:32.989
Hey, Steve.

36:32.990 --> 36:33.990
Yes?

36:33.990 --> 36:34.990
I feel you.

36:34.990 --> 36:35.990
I'm poking you.

36:35.991 --> 36:41.989
I know that.

36:41.990 --> 36:42.990
Steve, I'm sad.

36:42.991 --> 36:44.989
I'm not in a good mood.

36:44.990 --> 36:45.990
Why are you sad?

36:45.991 --> 36:48.539
I don't have anybody here.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.989
Everybody has someone.

36:49.990 --> 36:50.990
I'm so miserable.

36:50.991 --> 36:54.989
I am thoroughly confused.

36:54.990 --> 36:57.989
I'm just... I'm super lonely.

36:57.990 --> 37:02.119
Like, I swear to God, I feel
like I'm on the block again.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.989
I don't know if I can do this
anymore.

37:04.990 --> 37:04.991
I'm so lonely.

37:04.991 --> 37:07.119
I had no idea you felt like
this.

37:07.120 --> 37:11.989
Why don't I put some clothes on,
dry off, and we go play a game

37:11.990 --> 37:12.990
of chess.

37:12.991 --> 37:14.989
Hi, Liz.

37:14.990 --> 37:15.950
Hey, what's up?

37:15.951 --> 37:16.989
Hey.

37:16.990 --> 37:17.410
Why are you crying?

37:17.411 --> 37:18.989
I'm just feeling lonely.

37:18.990 --> 37:22.989
I'm going to go put some
clothes on, and we'll go play

37:22.990 --> 37:23.700
chess.

37:23.701 --> 37:24.989
Oh!

37:24.990 --> 37:29.289
Honestly, like, Austin used
to be, like, my only friend and

37:29.290 --> 37:31.989
he's not even talking to me
anymore.

37:31.990 --> 37:35.989
It's, like, like, I try to hang
out with you guys but it's like

37:35.990 --> 37:38.989
the three of you all are so
tight, I always feel like the

37:38.990 --> 37:40.989
fourth wheel.

37:40.990 --> 37:41.990
It's... it's terrible.

37:41.990 --> 37:41.991
Yeah.

37:41.991 --> 37:43.999
I can't take it anymore.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.989
Vanessa is always playing the
victim.

37:46.990 --> 37:49.989
"Poor me, poor me."

37:49.990 --> 37:51.989
This is definitely not the first
time I've seen Vanessa cry, so

37:51.990 --> 37:54.989
I'm just taking this with a
grain of salt.

37:54.990 --> 37:57.989
Talking about Austin, he's
obviously happy that we're in

37:57.990 --> 38:00.989
power, we don't have anything to
worry about.

38:00.990 --> 38:04.699
Like...
>> right.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.989
I mean, you're not mad at me for
anything.

38:06.990 --> 38:08.699
No not at all.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.989
You would tell me if
something was bothering?

38:11.990 --> 38:12.990
Yes, absolutely.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.989
I feel like every time I go
into a room everybody leaves.

38:15.990 --> 38:16.990
Oh, come on!

38:16.991 --> 38:18.539
She needs to get a grip.

38:18.540 --> 38:19.290
Enough of the show.

38:19.291 --> 38:20.989
We're sick of it.

38:20.990 --> 38:26.989
It's so weird that you're
feeling that way.

38:26.990 --> 38:27.990
( Sighs ).

38:27.990 --> 38:28.990
What happened now?

38:28.991 --> 38:31.989
I literally walk outside, and
she's in the hammock and she's

38:31.990 --> 38:35.989
like, "Liz, you can come here?"
And I walk over, and she's like,

38:35.990 --> 38:37.989
"is there something wrong with
Austin?

38:37.990 --> 38:39.539
He's acting really weird?

38:39.540 --> 38:41.119
Is he mad at me."

38:41.120 --> 38:44.989
And she's like, "I can just tell
something is up."

38:44.990 --> 38:48.989
She is, literally, the most
annoying bitch ever.

38:48.990 --> 38:49.990
That's scary.

38:49.991 --> 38:52.989
What if she decides to flip the
script?

38:52.990 --> 38:53.000
Could she?

38:53.001 --> 38:58.989
The fact that Vanessa is even
questioning Austin really scares

38:58.990 --> 38:58.991
me.

38:58.991 --> 39:04.989
The last time she got weird
feelings like this, she tried to

39:04.990 --> 39:07.989
backdoor help I want to put her
out of her misery and put her on

39:07.990 --> 39:08.990
the block.

39:08.991 --> 39:09.999
That way she can cry in jury.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.989
We are supposed to be a team.

39:11.990 --> 39:11.991
What happened?

39:11.991 --> 39:14.989
She is bugging out, and I'm
sick of it.

39:14.990 --> 39:17.989
I'm really scared if we leave
her in this game one week longer

39:17.990 --> 39:19.111
she's going to take you out.

39:48.990 --> 39:52.989
I'm thinking I threw this comp
this week and I really hope this

39:52.990 --> 39:58.699
doesn't come back to bite me
right now.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.119
This is my third time on the
block.

40:00.120 --> 40:03.989
I really wish I could have won
that veto so I could determine

40:03.990 --> 40:05.989
for myself if I was safe.

40:05.990 --> 40:07.699
At this point we'll have to see.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.989
Things have been weird
between me and Austin lately,

40:09.990 --> 40:11.989
just, like, not like it used to
be.

40:11.990 --> 40:14.989
We're not having the same types
of game conversations and I'm

40:14.990 --> 40:18.409
just hoping he didn't get in
Liz's ear to put me up as some

40:18.410 --> 40:24.989
kind of weird backdoor play.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.989
Hey, everyone.

40:26.990 --> 40:34.990
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:42.990 --> 40:44.989
This is the veto meeting.

40:44.990 --> 40:46.989
Becky and John have been
nominated for eviction.

40:46.990 --> 40:51.539
But I have the power to veto one
of the nominations.

40:51.540 --> 40:55.989
I want to give both the nominees
a chance to tell me why you

40:55.990 --> 40:58.989
think I should use the power of
veto to save you.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.829
Becky, you can go first.

41:00.830 --> 41:03.539
Well, Liz, one week ago, I
was h.O.H.

41:03.540 --> 41:08.829
And you were very comfortably on
this couch, not jut you, but so

41:08.830 --> 41:10.989
was your sister and so was
Austin.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.989
It was a hooj statement about
how I felt about you in this

41:13.990 --> 41:13.991
game.

41:13.991 --> 41:18.989
I would really like it if you
would use the power of veto on

41:18.990 --> 41:20.999
me.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.989
John, now it's your turn to
speak.

41:23.990 --> 41:27.289
All right.

41:27.290 --> 41:31.989
As much as I like these black
chairs, the blue couches are way

41:31.990 --> 41:31.991
more comfortable.

41:31.991 --> 41:35.989
And don't really want to talk
to Julie on Thursday.

41:35.990 --> 41:37.999
Please use the veto on me.

41:38.000 --> 41:38.990
Whoa!

41:38.990 --> 41:39.990
Whoa!

41:39.991 --> 41:43.949
You both are some of the best
competitors we've seen in the

41:43.950 --> 41:43.990
competitions thus far.

41:43.991 --> 41:47.999
And because of that, I feel one
of you will definitely be coming

41:48.000 --> 41:49.829
back from jury.

41:49.830 --> 41:57.830
So with that, I have decided to
not use the power of veto.

42:01.990 --> 42:09.990
This veto meeting is adjourned.

42:10.990 --> 42:14.989
Becky and I were the first
two people nominated in this

42:14.990 --> 42:18.989
game, and we've been together
ever since then on some level,

42:18.990 --> 42:22.989
and that relationship is going
to end, and whoever is left,

42:22.990 --> 42:24.989
it's going to be a who will new
ballgame for them.

42:24.990 --> 42:28.119
I very easily could have
backdoored Vanessa this week,

42:28.120 --> 42:30.989
but since everyone else is
targeting Vanessa, there is no

42:30.990 --> 42:33.989
reason for me to take her out
because she will always be a

42:33.990 --> 42:36.289
target in front of me or my
sister.

42:36.290 --> 42:39.989
So that's great for my game.

42:39.990 --> 42:43.989
I have a lot of work to do if
I want to stay in this house.

42:43.990 --> 42:45.539
I have no plans on giving up.

42:45.540 --> 42:47.989
I'm going to be strategic about
my moves and make sure I'm not

42:47.990 --> 42:50.949
the one walking out the door on
Thursday.

42:50.950 --> 42:54.989
Who will be evicted from the
"Big Brother" house, John or

42:54.990 --> 42:54.991
Becky?

42:54.991 --> 42:57.989
And the power supfor grabs in an
all-new battle for head of

42:57.990 --> 42:59.829
household.

42:59.830 --> 43:04.989
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00, 8:00 central on "big

43:04.990 --> 43:06.990
brother."
