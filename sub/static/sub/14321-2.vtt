WEBVTT

00:01.833 --> 00:03.625
[narrator]
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.625 --> 00:06.583
If we could time travel
without you, mutant, we would.

00:06.583 --> 00:08.583
I do not trust you, Fitzroy,

00:08.583 --> 00:11.208
so Nimrod will join
your trip across time

00:11.208 --> 00:13.416
to make sure
you perform the task.

00:13.416 --> 00:15.458
You must get help
and stop them

00:15.458 --> 00:17.375
before they change time
forever.

00:17.375 --> 00:18.458
[Shard]
Let's do it!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.125
What is that?

00:21.125 --> 00:22.875
[Xavier]
I have no idea!

00:28.625 --> 00:30.333
Are you okay, darling?

00:30.333 --> 00:32.333
What was that?

00:32.333 --> 00:33.750
[Bishop]
We're too late!

00:33.750 --> 00:35.875
While we were traveling,
Fitzroy and Nimrod

00:35.875 --> 00:37.458
already nailed Xavier

00:37.458 --> 00:39.166
and changed everything.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.875
We have to go back,
rescue Xavier,

00:41.875 --> 00:43.583
and keep this from happening.

00:43.583 --> 00:45.458
Who is Charles Xavier?

00:45.458 --> 00:47.875
And what are X-Men?

00:47.875 --> 00:50.166
We must touch base
in our time first

00:50.166 --> 00:52.000
before the portal
can send us further back.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.583
[Shard]
We must hurry.

00:53.583 --> 00:56.208
If the time change
has already hit 2055,

00:56.208 --> 00:58.583
all of our efforts
will be for nothing.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.333
-Ready, Logan?
-Let's go.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.875
Time travel?
Parallel futures?

01:05.875 --> 01:08.458
Mutants and assassins?

01:08.458 --> 01:10.875
You can't expect me
to believe all this!

01:10.875 --> 01:12.875
Moose! Rocco! Get them!

01:12.875 --> 01:14.708
Keep them away
from Xavier!

01:14.708 --> 01:15.875
My pleasure.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.458
[grunting]

01:17.458 --> 01:19.625
-[Shard] He's gone!
-[people screaming]

01:19.625 --> 01:21.833
Spread out!
We've got to find him

01:21.833 --> 01:23.750
before Fitzroy does.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.000
Electronic fuse!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.208
What in the world?

01:27.208 --> 01:29.250
-[shrill beep]
-No!

01:29.250 --> 01:32.375
[theme music playing]

02:41.416 --> 02:42.708
We must get Xavier!

02:56.708 --> 02:58.625
Fitzroy planted a bomb!

02:58.625 --> 03:00.500
Xavier never had a chance.

03:05.875 --> 03:08.250
That's it. It's over.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.458
And it's your fault!

03:11.458 --> 03:14.000
Because of your stupidity,
everyone I know

03:14.000 --> 03:15.750
might no longer exist.

03:15.750 --> 03:17.958
No no-neck redneck
dumps on my wife

03:17.958 --> 03:19.333
-and gets away with it.
-[siren wailing]

03:19.333 --> 03:20.708
[man]
There they are!

03:20.708 --> 03:22.583
They're the ones
that wrecked my joint.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.958
Now they're blowing up
the college!

03:24.958 --> 03:26.416
-[cop 1] Let's get those guys.
-[cop 2] Yeah.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.708
Bad time to mess with me.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.458
No! I have a better way.

03:32.625 --> 03:34.458
[lightning cracks]

03:34.458 --> 03:36.458
Whirlwind from the heavens,

03:36.458 --> 03:39.208
engulf these misguided souls.

03:39.208 --> 03:42.083
[screaming]

03:42.083 --> 03:43.583
[thunder cracking]

03:46.500 --> 03:48.291
We have to go back
to my time

03:48.291 --> 03:51.166
and hope that Forge and his
time portal still exist.

03:51.166 --> 03:54.000
Then we can come back
minutes before this time

03:54.000 --> 03:56.625
-and set things right.
-I'm off this merry-go-round.

03:56.625 --> 03:59.250
Take me and Storm back
to where you found us.

03:59.250 --> 04:02.000
Fighting for Magneto
wasn't so bad.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.083
I don't even know
this Xavier guy.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.583
The future
of their world rests

04:07.583 --> 04:09.083
in our hands.

04:10.875 --> 04:14.208
I know you too well to think
we could ever let them down.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.583
[sighs]

04:16.583 --> 04:17.833
Just my luck.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.000
Time to go!

04:20.500 --> 04:21.875
[screaming]

04:28.125 --> 04:29.750
[all muttering]

04:29.750 --> 04:30.875
Huh?

04:34.208 --> 04:37.000
[electricity crackles]

04:42.958 --> 04:44.833
We made it.

04:44.833 --> 04:47.458
This is our new world?

04:47.458 --> 04:50.458
It's huge! It's nothing like
when we left.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.708
Big deal. The machine
seems to work fine.

04:53.708 --> 04:56.583
Let's dig up that Forge guy
again and get movin'.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.083
If he still exists.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.083
Intruders!

05:03.083 --> 05:05.500
Get away!
You are not authorized!

05:07.250 --> 05:08.375
-Forge!
-[alarm blaring]

05:08.375 --> 05:09.500
What now?

05:12.083 --> 05:14.875
[alarm blaring]

05:14.875 --> 05:17.583
Calm down, man.
Cut that alarm.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.000
We're resistance, like you.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.416
Resistance?
What is that?

05:22.875 --> 05:24.333
What are you
talking about?

05:24.333 --> 05:26.708
The resistance
is people, mutants,

05:26.708 --> 05:29.708
thousands of them
fighting against Master Mold

05:29.708 --> 05:31.833
-and his sentinels.
-You're crazy!

05:31.833 --> 05:34.083
What world
did you come from?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.458
No one fights the Master.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.708
Easy, Bishop. He's not
to blame for any of this.

05:39.708 --> 05:42.625
-Nobody ever is.
-[groans]

05:42.625 --> 05:45.375
You sent us back in time
to prevent a killing.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.583
Don't you remember?

05:46.583 --> 05:48.583
No one has traveled yet.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.333
It is not permitted.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.416
I am still testing
the portal.

05:52.416 --> 05:55.125
I have never seen
any of you before.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.375
None of this matters.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.125
We have a job to do.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.875
Don't! They will know!

06:01.875 --> 06:03.708
Come on, old man.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.708
Who could scare you
worse than I can?

06:06.708 --> 06:08.875
[Forge]
Enforcers!

06:08.875 --> 06:10.833
[Shard]
Take cover!

06:10.833 --> 06:11.958
[screaming]

06:11.958 --> 06:14.166
[grunting]

06:32.708 --> 06:34.166
[yells]

06:50.458 --> 06:51.833
[grunts]

06:53.125 --> 06:55.458
Hold on, darling.
I'm here.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.166
No! Please!

06:58.166 --> 06:59.833
I've been loyal
to the Master.

06:59.833 --> 07:00.875
[screams]

07:04.291 --> 07:06.000
They don't care
about you!

07:07.625 --> 07:10.166
In another time,
you were my friend!

07:11.875 --> 07:14.458
Help us,
and we can save you!

07:15.416 --> 07:16.750
[screaming]

07:34.708 --> 07:37.708
All right.
Tell me what you need.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.000
Come on, our armbands have
the coordinates.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.208
Come on, darling.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.875
[growling]

07:46.875 --> 07:48.875
[yelling]

07:54.458 --> 07:56.500
[screaming]

08:10.083 --> 08:12.125
-Set it!
-It's damaged.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.500
So fix it!

08:13.500 --> 08:16.000
But they'll send
more Enforcers!

08:16.000 --> 08:18.583
Then you better fix it fast.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.583
Let's go!

08:21.583 --> 08:23.708
The portal was damaged
in the fight.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.000
He's working on it.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.708
He better hurry.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.500
'Cause if we end up stuck here,

08:28.500 --> 08:32.125
he's gonna get to know these
up close and personal.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.333
[Fitzroy]
Everything went smoothly.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.708
Because of what
I've accomplished,

08:37.708 --> 08:39.583
you are now
the undisputed ruler

08:39.583 --> 08:40.708
of your world.

08:40.708 --> 08:41.708
[beeping]

08:43.458 --> 08:46.166
Xavier's followers won't be
bothering me anymore.

08:46.166 --> 08:49.458
If I believe you.

08:49.458 --> 08:50.875
And what of the others?

08:50.875 --> 08:53.291
Others? What others?

08:53.291 --> 08:57.583
The mutants you battled
were time travelers.

08:57.583 --> 09:01.000
Whatever changes were made
to our world by your mission,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
those four were untouched.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.708
Like you, they existed

09:05.708 --> 09:07.416
outside of time.

09:07.416 --> 09:10.208
[sniggers]

09:10.208 --> 09:12.250
What harm could
four measly mutants do?

09:12.250 --> 09:14.166
[electronic voice]
Alert! Alert!

09:14.166 --> 09:16.375
Transport building
security measures ineffective.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.416
Unregistered mutants
still active.

09:18.416 --> 09:20.166
Obliterate them!

09:20.166 --> 09:23.250
If they should escape,
they will travel back in time

09:23.250 --> 09:25.625
to undo your work.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.708
Make sure
that doesn't happen.

09:28.708 --> 09:32.625
Destroy Forge
and his time machine!

09:32.625 --> 09:34.958
I will take no chances!

09:34.958 --> 09:38.208
If you fail,
do not bother to return.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.750
Come on, stupid!

09:39.750 --> 09:41.958
Wait, Nimrod.

09:41.958 --> 09:45.125
I have one more thing
to discuss.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.166
We're gonna die.

09:47.166 --> 09:49.458
-[Master Mold] I'm weary
of all mutants...
-Shut up, before I...

09:49.458 --> 09:52.458
[Master Mold] ...even those
useful as slaves.

09:52.458 --> 09:55.083
After they've destroyed
the time machine,

09:55.083 --> 09:58.500
eliminate Fitzroy and Bantam.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.458
I told you!

10:00.458 --> 10:02.250
Come on.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.833
[Wolverine]
What's the hold-up?

10:03.833 --> 10:06.166
[Forge] The machine
was severely damaged.

10:06.166 --> 10:07.708
I'll try.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.500
You'll have to do
better than that.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.375
I just need
a little more time.

10:12.375 --> 10:13.875
Don't take all day.

10:13.875 --> 10:16.000
[loud thudding]

10:25.833 --> 10:27.583
[grunting]

10:36.625 --> 10:38.458
[growling]

10:38.458 --> 10:40.000
[Wolverine]
Going down!

10:49.125 --> 10:50.291
Thanks.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.166
Whirlwind,
take him from us!

11:04.458 --> 11:05.625
We're going to make it!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.291
[Wolverine]
Tell that to Nimrod!

11:11.583 --> 11:12.750
[grunts]

11:15.833 --> 11:17.583
Back at you, lowlife!

11:21.708 --> 11:23.625
-Where's Forge?
-Fitzroy!

11:23.625 --> 11:25.458
It's that mutant traitor!

11:27.166 --> 11:28.291
[Bishop]
Huh?

11:30.208 --> 11:31.250
[Fitzroy]
Duck!

11:34.000 --> 11:36.208
This will explain
everything. I just want--

11:36.208 --> 11:37.458
[screams]

11:39.708 --> 11:42.583
Fitzroy! Fitzroy!

11:42.583 --> 11:45.958
Hurry! It's working!

11:45.958 --> 11:47.875
We must help Fitzroy!

11:49.750 --> 11:52.166
It's too late for him! Jump!

11:56.208 --> 11:57.583
[screams, groans]

11:57.583 --> 11:58.583
Kid!

12:02.500 --> 12:04.000
[grunting]

12:07.583 --> 12:10.708
I can't make it. Go.

12:10.708 --> 12:12.833
No, I won't!

12:12.833 --> 12:15.583
If your mission
is successful,

12:15.583 --> 12:17.083
I'll be fine.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.166
So will Forge.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.250
It's too late!

12:19.250 --> 12:20.708
Shard, please!

12:22.458 --> 12:23.583
Hit your armband!

12:26.333 --> 12:27.458
Go.

12:32.958 --> 12:34.166
[Shard]
Forge.

12:35.875 --> 12:38.000
Can you hear me?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.375
Forge.

12:39.375 --> 12:40.708
Did they make it?

12:55.583 --> 12:57.083
[grunting]

12:57.083 --> 12:58.583
Here we go again.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.166
Where's Shard?

13:00.166 --> 13:02.458
-She didn't make it.
-Tough break, pal.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.583
I know she was your friend.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.875
She was my sister.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.416
I am sorry.
We didn't know.

13:08.416 --> 13:10.000
She knew the risks.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
But I'm not counting her
out yet.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.708
I plan on seeing her again,
'cause this time,

13:14.708 --> 13:16.500
we're not gonna mess up.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.333
We got a few minutes.
Let's see what Fitzroy gave us.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.250
By the time you see this,
I will no longer exist.

13:25.875 --> 13:28.833
[man] Nobody busts up my place.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.750
Moose! Rocco! Get them!

13:31.875 --> 13:33.708
Keep them away
from Xavier!

13:33.708 --> 13:34.708
My pleasure.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.416
[shouting]

13:39.416 --> 13:41.416
[screaming]

13:43.416 --> 13:45.166
[grunts]

13:45.166 --> 13:47.583
We are not here
to hurt you.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.083
Bad listening.

13:52.625 --> 13:53.875
Professor?

13:55.166 --> 13:57.083
He's gone!

13:57.083 --> 13:58.833
It's all so unreal.

13:58.833 --> 13:59.958
[grunts]

13:59.958 --> 14:01.750
-Hey!
-Be quiet!

14:01.750 --> 14:03.333
Your life is in danger.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.875
Look, pal,
if we wanted to hurt you,

14:05.875 --> 14:07.583
we would have
done it already.

14:07.583 --> 14:09.375
So, are you coming quietly,

14:09.375 --> 14:11.125
or do you wanna make
some noise.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.291
[groans]

14:12.291 --> 14:14.958
You did it again, Logan.

14:14.958 --> 14:16.125
I'm sorry, darling.

14:18.166 --> 14:21.000
[Xavier] Time travel?
Parallel futures?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.750
Mutants and assassins?

14:23.750 --> 14:27.125
You can't expect me
to believe all this!

14:27.125 --> 14:28.333
What is happening?

14:29.416 --> 14:32.458
I'm blown up here,
in this lab?

14:32.458 --> 14:34.416
Not if we can help it, bub.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.000
Fitzroy is the man
who assassinated you.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.083
He won't be so lucky
next time.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.500
You can't expect me
to believe all this!

14:42.500 --> 14:44.833
Read our minds
if you doubt us.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.250
You're telling the truth!

15:05.250 --> 15:07.708
But one of you
does not wish

15:07.708 --> 15:09.458
your mission to succeed.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.708
You!

15:10.708 --> 15:12.250
Give me one good reason

15:12.250 --> 15:14.083
why I shouldn't blow
your head off.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.583
I feel the way I feel, bub.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.708
That don't mean
I'd turn traitor!

15:18.708 --> 15:20.333
-Fitzroy!
-[gasps]

15:23.208 --> 15:25.750
-Charles?
-Cindy, I'm so sorry.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.250
My, uh, friends scared you.

15:28.250 --> 15:31.125
Who are they?
What do they want?

15:31.125 --> 15:33.750
[Xavier]
They're here to help me.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.708
[sniffing]

15:35.708 --> 15:37.583
You got a problem?

15:37.583 --> 15:38.583
Yeah.

15:39.708 --> 15:41.250
Nimrod!

15:43.416 --> 15:44.625
[grunts]

15:46.291 --> 15:47.750
[yells]

15:49.416 --> 15:50.708
My turn!

15:54.291 --> 15:55.375
Got you!

15:55.375 --> 15:56.750
[screams]

16:06.083 --> 16:07.125
[screams]

16:09.125 --> 16:12.000
[yelling]

16:12.000 --> 16:13.166
[grunts]

16:18.833 --> 16:21.625
[Xavier] Such power
and destruction!

16:24.083 --> 16:25.833
What was that?

16:25.833 --> 16:29.250
[Storm] The future's
most horrible living weapon.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.583
He will quickly reconstruct.

16:38.708 --> 16:41.875
Let's see what you had
for breakfast!

16:41.875 --> 16:43.000
[screams]

16:52.458 --> 16:54.375
You're history!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.958
You gonna heal
your way out of this?

17:01.958 --> 17:02.958
Give me a minute.

17:02.958 --> 17:04.875
Is everyone okay?

17:04.875 --> 17:06.750
-Yeah!
-[Fitzroy] Guess again, Bishop!

17:06.750 --> 17:08.291
Fitzroy!

17:08.291 --> 17:10.875
In 60 seconds,
no more Xavier!

17:10.875 --> 17:12.375
Get Xavier out of here!

17:14.000 --> 17:16.291
[grunting]

17:16.291 --> 17:17.875
[Fitzroy]
And ruin the fun?

17:17.875 --> 17:19.625
You must let us go!

17:19.625 --> 17:21.625
And why must I?

17:21.625 --> 17:24.625
If you do not,
you will cease to exist!

17:24.625 --> 17:27.458
[laughing]
Get serious!

17:27.458 --> 17:29.458
I just cashed in, big.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.833
She's dead serious, mutant.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.708
I know this is crazy,
Fitzroy, but I am you.

17:34.708 --> 17:38.083
And I'm begging you,
do not kill Xavier!

17:38.083 --> 17:41.750
If you do, Master Mold
will become all powerful,

17:41.750 --> 17:44.291
and he will destroy you
and Bantam!

17:44.291 --> 17:46.583
History will be altered!

17:46.583 --> 17:50.000
Destroy Bantam?
Not a good idea!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.166
Look there.

17:53.958 --> 17:55.833
It is ourselves
on our first trip back,

17:55.833 --> 17:57.833
trying to stop you.

17:57.833 --> 18:00.458
Do you believe
your own warning now?

18:00.458 --> 18:02.625
How do I know
Master Mold will betray me

18:02.625 --> 18:04.083
if Xavier dies?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.583
[Wolverine]
Wait a few seconds...

18:05.583 --> 18:07.000
-[beeping]
-[Wolverine] ...and find out.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
[Bantam]
Do something, Fritzy!

18:09.000 --> 18:10.083
All right!

18:11.375 --> 18:12.583
Smart move.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.958
[shrill beep]

18:23.416 --> 18:25.166
And if we get out
of here alive,

18:25.166 --> 18:27.958
don't ever pull a stunt
like this again.

18:27.958 --> 18:30.583
[Bantam] Time to go!
Time to go!

18:30.583 --> 18:31.875
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.708
Time to go home!

18:33.708 --> 18:35.375
It would seem that
we have overstayed

18:35.375 --> 18:36.416
our welcome.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.333
Sorry, pal...

18:50.750 --> 18:53.416
but you'll be fine,
in a day or two.

18:56.875 --> 19:00.291
I hate this!

19:04.708 --> 19:06.416
[Bishop]
Wow.

19:06.416 --> 19:09.333
It's incredible how one kid
could mean so much

19:09.333 --> 19:10.875
to so many people.

19:15.208 --> 19:16.333
What now?

19:16.333 --> 19:17.958
With him alive,

19:17.958 --> 19:20.000
we ain't even supposed
to exist.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.833
I don't know.
Why are we still here?

19:23.833 --> 19:26.333
As long as your armbands
are on you and functioning,

19:26.333 --> 19:28.750
you'll both exist
outside of time.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.875
How long?

19:29.875 --> 19:31.291
Sorry.

19:31.291 --> 19:32.958
The charge only lasts
a couple of days.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.583
It was good, darling.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.958
It was the best,
tough guy.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.708
I love you, Logan.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.083
Don't you leave me.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.875
[screaming]

20:16.833 --> 20:18.416
What was that?

20:18.416 --> 20:19.875
Beats me.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.708
You think we could
just attract ants

20:21.708 --> 20:23.000
like normal people!

20:24.833 --> 20:26.458
Thanks for the tumble, Storm.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.166
We ought to wrestle
more often.

20:28.166 --> 20:30.875
Now, Logan,
some women might think

20:30.875 --> 20:32.833
that you were flirting.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.166
[chuckles]

20:34.166 --> 20:36.500
Lucky you know me
better than that.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.958
We will never know.

20:52.458 --> 20:54.416
[theme music playing]
