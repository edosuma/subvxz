the loss of so many lives
began with a single

00:59.617 --> 01:03.515
It's human nature to seek even

01:03.617 --> 01:07.414

as catastrophic as these.

There was no stopping it.

stood 30 feet high,

06:23.453 --> 06:27.476
It followed the line of
the ancient Roman frontier,
2,000 years before,

06:27.587 --> 06:32.281
spanning 18 miles,
east coast to west,
cutting Britain in half.

06:33.453 --> 06:38.647
Coastal waters were mined
and patrolled. The skies
were declared a no-fly zone,

06:38.753 --> 06:43.651
and orders were given to
shoot down any aircraft in
violation of the quarantine.

06:44.186 --> 06:49.414
The idea was simple.
Nobody came out,
and nobody went in.

about the second part.

as the people fought

were plundered,

had turned its back
on the hot zone,

so the rest of the world
turned its back on Britain.

In 2023, when the rising

14:55.970 --> 14:58.232
we extended the Thames

15:03.304 --> 15:05.997

flood the canals, blockade

15:33.771 --> 15:37.430

there'll be panic,

and that's just for starters.

15:42.504 --> 15:44.493

When the wall went up,
the government at that
time, naturally,

16:18.289 --> 16:19.584
wanted to know
what was happening
on the other side.

16:21.406 --> 16:23.667
So they re-tasked one of
their military satellites

16:23.771 --> 16:25.999

of Edinburgh and Glasgow.

What else could it be?

16:52.305 --> 16:55.669
And if there are survivors,
there must surely be a cure.

16:55.772 --> 16:57.567
What we have to do
is get our hands on it.

16:57.672 --> 17:00.263
We already have
a team standing by.

17:01.172 --> 17:03.035
All we need is somebody
to lead them.

17:03.138 --> 17:05.569
Someone to take them in,
find the cure

17:05.672 --> 17:07.262
and deliver it into our hands
before it's too late
to turn the tide.

17:09.505 --> 17:12.164
You don't know how many
survivors there are.

17:12.271 --> 17:15.500
And the team might not find
them in time. They might
not find them at all.

17:15.605 --> 17:18.069
And they could
still be contagious.

17:18.172 --> 17:20.229
That's what the team's
going to find out.

17:20.338 --> 17:23.736
You've known for
three fucking years
that they were up there,

17:23.839 --> 17:25.566
but you swept it
under the carpet.

17:25.672 --> 17:28.502
Scotland's dead
have long since
been laid to rest.

17:28.605 --> 17:31.503
Yesterday, if I turned up
on the 6:00 news with
a survivor in tow,

17:31.605 --> 17:34.469
they'd have strung me up
from the nearest lamp-post
by the balls.

17:34.572 --> 17:39.231
But if, in 48 hours,
I arrive with a survivor
and a cure,

17:39.338 --> 17:41.600
sure they won't
give a flying fuck
about the survivor,

17:41.705 --> 17:44.603
but they'll be lining up
to kiss my arse
for that cure.

17:44.705 --> 17:48.069

survival is timing,
and ours is running out.

just fit the bill.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.730

Long enough.

18:36.838 --> 18:39.861
But that doesn't matter now.
Matters to me.

18:40.472 --> 18:41.903
There are survivors
out there.

18:42.005 --> 18:44.835
This is not some
personal quest
I'm sending you on.

18:44.938 --> 18:48.564
Focus on your mission.
Who's behind it? Hatcher?

18:48.673 --> 18:53.401
Hatcher's got the swagger
and the smiles, but it's
Canaris who pulls the strings.

18:53.506 --> 18:55.665
He's the power
behind the throne.

18:55.772 --> 18:58.204
And he's not someone
you want to pick
a fight with.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.635
Who, me?
I'm serious.

19:01.539 --> 19:05.096
If the truth got out,
it would bring Hatcher,
the government,

19:05.205 --> 19:07.569
the whole fucking
system down.

19:07.673 --> 19:11.366
And there's no way
Canaris is ever gonna
let that happen.

19:11.472 --> 19:14.768
Once you're over that wall,
there's no rules,

19:14.873 --> 19:17.338
no backup.
Better that way.

19:38.472 --> 19:40.870
Look after this for me,
would you?

19:51.739 --> 19:53.227
Don't suppose
you got a cigarette?

19:53.339 --> 19:56.794
There's no smoking
on the helicopter,
and I don't smoke.

19:56.906 --> 19:58.303
Fair enough.

19:59.173 --> 20:00.433
Dr. Marcus Kane,

20:00.539 --> 20:03.937
he was leading
the research into the virus
when the gates were closed.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.029
He was trapped
inside the hot zone.

20:06.140 --> 20:09.970
His lab was located inside
the quarantine compound
in Glasgow.

20:10.606 --> 20:14.198
If anybody was capable
of developing a cure,
it was him.

20:14.306 --> 20:18.170
I suggest you start
at the lab. Pick up
the trail from there.

20:19.773 --> 20:23.001
You'll rendezvous with
the rest of the team
at the wall,

20:23.106 --> 20:25.901
then you'll proceed north
in two armored transports.

Scotland is still Why not fly in?
a no-fly zone.

20:29.606 --> 20:33.164
Hatcher needs to keep this
as low profile as possible.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.932
So if we don't make it out,
no one will know we went in.

20:37.773 --> 20:39.535

If it's there,
I'll find it.

20:51.473 --> 20:56.405
You'll need this. It's a GPS
locator beacon. It'll tell us
exactly where you are.

20:58.106 --> 21:01.072
We'll have a gun ship
standing by to extract
your team.

21:01.173 --> 21:02.264
So much for low profile.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.465
Once you have the cure,
it won't matter.

21:11.407 --> 21:14.100

find anything up there?

Too many people crammed
into ghettos so tight
they can barely move.

the more chance there is
of the same thing
happening all over again.

you suggesting?
