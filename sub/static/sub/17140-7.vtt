01:23.151 --> 01:24.952
Does this hurt? I'd never
want to hurt you.

01:25.018 --> 01:28.021
The first few years,
I couldn't bear to be touched.

01:28.156 --> 01:31.525
Talking was torture
because of the burns.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.827
But I adapted,
learned to communicate

01:33.894 --> 01:35.162
with the tools at hand.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.632
Kept me distracted.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.502
Kept me from
scratching my scars open.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.208
Ahem.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.346
That was my father's.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.350
Second War, paratrooper.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.019
Dropped men behind
the lines at night.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.623
Can't talk. Snipers.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.791
So...

02:08.596 --> 02:09.763
Crickets.

02:11.699 --> 02:12.699
Wow.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.641
I just want you to know

02:20.708 --> 02:24.211
that working on this case
has been a gift.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.646
Yes.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.682
I know that I stumbled at first,

02:28.749 --> 02:30.584
but I've grown.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.651
I saw the video.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.054
You surpassed
all my expectations.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.856
Thank you.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.927
That' all I've ever wanted.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.530
To stand in front of a jury,

02:42.596 --> 02:44.998
wow them with my eloquence,

02:45.065 --> 02:46.300
and...

02:47.601 --> 02:49.470
it's all thanks to you.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.738
No.

02:50.804 --> 02:51.905
And I want you to know

02:51.972 --> 02:55.276
that, no matter what
happens in this case,

02:55.343 --> 02:58.679
it's not going to affect
our feelings, is it?

03:00.581 --> 03:01.682
No.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.266
W-Why do you keep shoving
these fucking pictures at me?

03:18.332 --> 03:19.700
I mean, they do
get a closer look.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.035
You got to be
really strong to do that.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.471
I don't even know
what that means.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.005
When do I get my car back?

03:25.072 --> 03:26.173
That's it?

03:26.274 --> 03:27.675
That's all you got to say to me?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.276
He already told you
he doesn't know anything.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.678
No. You're the one
that said that.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.346
He hasn't asked a damn question.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.315
Look, I know
it doesn't look good,

03:34.382 --> 03:35.749
but there's not a law

03:35.816 --> 03:37.885
against having a dead
snitch in your trunk.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.354
So that's why you killed him?
Because he was a snitch?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.689
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.957
Yeah, I killed him,
I threw him in my trunk,

03:44.024 --> 03:45.393
and then I called you guys.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.960
God damn. Be real, man.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.562
Look, he has an alibi.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.364
All right?
All you have to do

03:50.431 --> 03:52.299
is call Donald Cooperman.
That's it.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.967
We called,
and his assistant says

03:54.034 --> 03:55.302
he doesn't want to get involved.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.770
Great, but you still
have the photos

03:56.837 --> 03:58.906
that show that he was
serving Cooperman a subpoena

03:58.972 --> 04:02.343
at the exact time that
this guy was getting stabbed

04:02.410 --> 04:04.578
and put in my client's trunk.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.714
- This guy.
- That's right.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.780
What time was that?

04:07.815 --> 04:08.716
Uh...

04:08.782 --> 04:10.451
You said you knew
the exact time.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.185
- Did I?
- We don't know
the exact time

04:12.320 --> 04:13.754
that this guy was stabbed.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.988
Cool. Neither do I.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.324
But I would like to know

04:16.390 --> 04:17.990
why are there people
sticking dead bodies

04:18.024 --> 04:19.159
in your client's trunk.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.861
To frame him, obviously.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.530
We have motive.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.366
Karl Stoltz was investigating
two of your clients

04:25.433 --> 04:26.734
on a drug deal.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.335
You want me to give you
some more motive?

04:28.336 --> 04:29.970
He killed my client
and tried to kill me,

04:30.037 --> 04:32.339
so there you go.
Yeah, there's all kind
of fucking motive.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.342
I get it.
But you got no prints,

04:35.343 --> 04:38.211
no blood, no weapon,
none of that shit.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.589
So unless you're
going to arrest me,

04:39.613 --> 04:40.881
I think we're done here.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.460
No, so I thought
I had more time this morning.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.703
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.697
So I decided to make
breakfast like an adult,

04:56.764 --> 04:58.832
And everyone saying "Avocado
toast, avocado toast,"

04:58.899 --> 05:01.769
so I'm there with
an avocado in this hand

05:01.835 --> 05:03.504
and trying to get the pit out.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.774
You call. The fucking
knife slips, right?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.477
And it slices me
right fucking there

05:09.543 --> 05:11.512
on my middle finger, mind you,

05:11.579 --> 05:13.146
which I fucking need.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.749
And it's like four
stitches, they're saying.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.651
And I think there's,
like, seven to ten days,

05:17.718 --> 05:19.387
and then it's going to be fine.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.124
But I've never had
to deal with that before.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.258
Talk to me.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.127
Look, I'm...
I'm telling you,

05:27.194 --> 05:28.395
it's... What's going on?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.465
Oh, my God, what's going on?

05:31.532 --> 05:33.501
What's going on?

05:33.567 --> 05:35.135
Just talk to me.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.404
Um...

05:37.771 --> 05:39.540
um... okay.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.209
Uh, I don't...
I don't know. Um...

05:42.275 --> 05:43.811
do you...
How about a story?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.679
Yeah?

05:45.746 --> 05:46.814
Um, so...

05:46.880 --> 05:49.282
Uh, I fucking do remember one.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.419
Uh, there one...
there once was an oyster

05:51.452 --> 05:52.986
whose story I tell

05:53.053 --> 05:56.890
that found that some sand
had gotten into his shell.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.459
It was only a grain,

05:58.526 --> 06:00.093
but it gave him great glee

06:00.160 --> 06:01.429
for oysters have feelings...

06:01.495 --> 06:02.706
Just tell me
it's going to be okay.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.964
It's going to be okay.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.166
You're fine.
You're okay.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.968
You're okay.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.837
You're okay.

06:09.903 --> 06:10.738
You're okay.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.007
So you admit
that you are a liar.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.809
I lied about Ryan Larson,

06:15.876 --> 06:18.078
but that does not
make me a liar.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.148
To lie is to be a liar
be definition.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.884
If I may explain...

06:23.951 --> 06:26.219
The question is not
if you're a liar

06:26.286 --> 06:27.455
because you are.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.856
The question is, were you lying

06:28.922 --> 06:30.323
when you said he was suicidal

06:30.458 --> 06:31.692
or are you lying now?

06:31.759 --> 06:33.302
Or when you broke
your oath to the Church

06:33.326 --> 06:35.104
not to reveal the secrets
of the confessional.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.463
I would like to explain.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.598
You have already tried.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.032
You can try again with the jury.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.768
Let's just hope none
of them are Catholics

06:40.834 --> 06:42.536
or people who care
about the truth.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.874
Clearly Mr. McBride has
bigger legal problems

06:46.940 --> 06:47.808
than our case.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.811
Why hasn't he been charged yet?

06:50.878 --> 06:53.481
Do you really think
he killed someone? Come on.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.182
I mean, I know you hate the guy,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.084
but... but murder?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.485
He's killed others...

06:58.486 --> 06:59.620
not directly,

06:59.687 --> 07:01.522
but by his actions
as a defense lawyer

07:01.589 --> 07:02.656
releasing killers.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.758
This is a huge break for us,

07:04.825 --> 07:06.660
whether McBride
gets charged or not.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.061
It's a distraction for him.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.731
Can you imagine
the pressure
that he's under?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.966
Plus, it means that Patty...

07:13.033 --> 07:14.768
whatever her name is

07:14.835 --> 07:16.704
is going to have to bear
more of the burden,

07:16.770 --> 07:19.106
which is great.
She's never tried a case.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.641
You've never tried a case.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.544
I didn't go
to Laverne Law School.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.780
Wow. Look at you,
so confident.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.882
Thank you.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.019
So McBride is going to file
for a continuance.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.687
It would be malpractice not to.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.089
And I say that we
oppose it strongly.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.692
- Are you sure about that?
- Absolutely.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.794
Every single day
that this case drags on,

07:40.861 --> 07:43.964
Borns Tech is vulnerable
to a decline in stock value,

07:44.031 --> 07:45.833
and that makes America
vulnerable.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.369
I mean, letting a nobody
like Billy McBride

07:49.436 --> 07:51.338
hold up a great corporation

07:51.404 --> 07:54.542
with a frivolous
and ridiculous lawsuit?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.543
It's not just wrong,
it endangers everything

07:56.544 --> 07:59.980
that matters to our c-c...

08:00.047 --> 08:02.115
c-c-c...

08:03.250 --> 08:04.718
c-c...

08:10.457 --> 08:11.457
country.

08:14.862 --> 08:15.796
Ahem.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.130
Lucy,

08:17.197 --> 08:20.033
do you need me to fill
a prescription for you?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.100
F...

08:24.371 --> 08:25.739
I'm fine.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.607
Yeah.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.577
You seem... fine.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.179
I'm fine.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.150
I'm fine.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.958
I swear.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.730
I'm fine.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.700
So Rothenberg clearly feels

08:52.766 --> 08:54.702
that greed is ruining
our society,

08:54.768 --> 08:56.704
but is that greed systemic

08:56.770 --> 08:59.139
or a result
of individual choices?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.310
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Hi.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.656
Uh, yeah,
Denise McBride, please.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.946
- Denise?
- Denise McBride.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.653
- And who are you?
- Don't worry about it.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.782
- Come on.
- Sorry.

09:08.849 --> 09:09.917
It's okay. Go ahead.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.151
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.053
- Boy, am I.
- What is going on?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.055
What happened to your hand?
Is my dad okay?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.600
- It's avocado...
- Did something happen?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.034
Was there an accident?
Why are you here?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.093
Your dad's fine.
Your dad's fine, okay?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.638
He had a little bit
of a panic attack.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.063
Panic attack?
Like a heart attack?

09:23.130 --> 09:25.332
- Is he in the hospital?
- Like an anxiety attack.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.334
He's fine, though.
He wouldn't go
to the hospital.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.635
Of course he wouldn't.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.403
It's like an anxiety
thing, you know.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.673
- He's okay.
- He's fine, okay?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.641
I'm sorry. I really
didn't mean to scare you.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.909
Jesus, Patty.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.646
I'm sorry. Look.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.682
Uh, the reason...

09:41.749 --> 09:43.651
the reason why I'm...
I'm here

09:43.684 --> 09:45.052
is, um...

09:47.487 --> 09:49.056
you seem to be the only person

09:49.122 --> 09:50.691
who knows how to ground him.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.894
And he could really
use that right now.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.897
So if there's anything
that you can do,

09:56.964 --> 09:59.833
I just... I'd really
appreciate it. Okay?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.368
Why are you doing this?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.703
What do you mean?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.371
This case. Why are
any of you doing it?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.073
It's destroying him.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.908
It looks like it's
destroying you.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.878
My mom is acting like
a complete crazy person.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.512
Okay, with all due respect,

10:12.579 --> 10:14.047
your mother's not
my fucking problem.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.449
Okay? And, uh,

10:16.516 --> 10:18.051
no one's getting paid for this.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.288
So I don't know why
the fuck we're doing this.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.622
But...

10:23.623 --> 10:25.292
everyone needs a reason

10:25.358 --> 10:26.694
to wake up in the morning,

10:26.760 --> 10:31.031
and it's a pretty good
fucking reason.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.568
I'm having a day, okay?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.636
Okay.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.938
So...

10:39.773 --> 10:41.141
are you in?

10:43.376 --> 10:44.377
- Of course.
- Great.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.148
Go learn something.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.435
His tongue and his
dick were cut off.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.370
LAPD didn't mention it?

11:10.437 --> 11:11.437
No.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.074
They didn't find his tongue,

11:14.141 --> 11:17.077
but his dick was in his mouth.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.912
Jesus Christ.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.814
What the hell's
happening here, man?

11:21.982 --> 11:24.284
We honestly don't know.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.753
But, obviously,
someone's mad enough

11:26.754 --> 11:28.288
to send you a message,

11:28.355 --> 11:30.824
and he was the message.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.794
But we don't know.

11:35.628 --> 11:36.964
Here you go.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.138
All records of foreign sales

11:45.205 --> 11:46.974
by Borns Tech of cluster bombs.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.641
Are you kidding me?

11:48.776 --> 11:49.977
I asked Borns Tech.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.511
They just say
they don't make them.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.080
We're asking for all

11:53.146 --> 11:55.348
of Karl Stoltz'
military records, too.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.950
We need to tie him

11:57.017 --> 11:58.986
to Borns Tech and prove
that they hired him

11:59.052 --> 12:01.188
to kill Rachel Kennedy.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.824
That guy doesn't
have any records.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.392
Go serve the State Department,

12:05.458 --> 12:07.427
the Pentagon. DOD.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.562
Oh, believe me, I'm
gonna serve all of them.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.998
I'm just starting with you.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.402
I told you what I
told you as a favor.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.004
I understand that.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.875
Sorry to be
such an asshole, man,

12:21.942 --> 12:24.077
but I got to do
what I got to do.

12:26.814 --> 12:31.584
Fucking with the FBI
over one case.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.886
Sure you want to do that?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.922
Yeah, pretty sure.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.637
What's up, bud?
What are you doing?

12:50.703 --> 12:52.439
I'm drawing your picture.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.441
Why would you be doing that?

12:54.507 --> 12:55.608
You got a really good face.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.344
Bullshit.
Don't give me that.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.088
No, no, really. You got
some great character...

12:59.112 --> 13:00.981
Who are you doing this
for? Seriously.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.916
Just for practice,
just for the heck of it.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.152
This is what I do.
I sit here all day,
and I draw...

13:05.218 --> 13:06.729
- You've been here all day?
- ...people as they come by.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.955
All day, yeah.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.689
And you draw other people, too.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.224
- Yeah, plenty of them.
- Let me see.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.927
I can't because actually
I gave them the pictures.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.262
Would you like your picture?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.297
- You'll give it to me?
- Absolutely.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.365
Here we go.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.436
All yours.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.604
Enjoy.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.973
Okay.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.875
Sorry about that, man.
You just never know.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.085
- You know what I mean?
- It's not a problem.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.011
- Enjoy it.
- Okay, buddy.

13:37.150 --> 13:42.956
I haven't stuttered once
in over six weeks.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.925
But you stuttered yesterday

13:44.992 --> 13:46.626
and the day before.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.895
It was on one word.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.030
It was on one stupid
little word.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.898
And you know what the word was?

13:51.899 --> 13:53.300
Country.

13:53.366 --> 13:57.304
Country. And you know why
I probably hit that word?

13:57.370 --> 14:00.073
It was because I was
in the presence of Callie,

14:00.140 --> 14:02.775
who's a card-carrying
c-c-cunt.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.345
Good for you.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.050
You no longer have
a speaking part

14:10.117 --> 14:11.418
in the trial.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.554
Okay, first of all,

14:14.621 --> 14:16.656
if I were to stutter
in court, which I won't,

14:16.723 --> 14:17.924
but if I were,

14:17.925 --> 14:20.760
that would only serve
to humanize me

14:20.827 --> 14:21.929
in front of the jury,

14:21.995 --> 14:23.396
which could run to the benefit

14:23.463 --> 14:26.466
of our very inhuman-
and monstrous-seeming client.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.936
You put me on this case

14:29.002 --> 14:30.370
because I'm smart
and I'm talented,

14:30.437 --> 14:35.342
and I have done great work,
thanks to you.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.510
I've done it...

14:37.577 --> 14:38.945
behind the scenes, maybe,

14:38.946 --> 14:42.582
but I... I deserve
to be seen doing it.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.585
Shaken confidence
does not serve the client

14:45.652 --> 14:47.187
or the firm.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.190
My confidence is not shaken.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.458
Mine is.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.002
Come on.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.206
I'm ready for this.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.976
Let me do it.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.444
Please.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.984
You'll still be a valuable
member of the team.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.288
And a dear friend.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.630
Are you breaking up with me?

15:35.202 --> 15:36.503
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.409
Callie.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.811
I hear you're back on top
with Borns Tech.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.446
Not surprising.
You always seem

15:46.513 --> 15:48.615
to get what you want in the end.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.384
The only thing I want
in the world is you.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.386
That's why...
why I texted Denise:

15:53.453 --> 15:55.053
because I want to be
a part of your life,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.490
- all parts of your life.
- Uh-huh.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.460
Well, your methodology
is disqualifying.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.429
I'm so... I'm s...

16:02.495 --> 16:03.230
I'm sorry...

16:03.296 --> 16:06.199
You traumatized my daughter.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.034
You traumatized me
in the process.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.369
We have no future together.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.506
If you never believe
anything I say again,

16:13.573 --> 16:14.574
believe that.

16:15.742 --> 16:16.742
Hey.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.612
If you care anything

16:19.679 --> 16:21.514
about what's left of your
little family unit,

16:21.581 --> 16:23.459
you might want to tell your
ex-husband to cry uncle

16:23.483 --> 16:26.186
because when I get done
with him...

16:26.253 --> 16:28.455
It's just difficult
to destroy dads

16:28.521 --> 16:31.091
without daughters becoming
collateral damage.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.061
Sometimes ex-wives, too.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.365
Fuck you.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.546
Finally. You get stuck
in the stairwell?

16:53.613 --> 16:54.981
Move.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.949
Let's look at the arrest report.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.689
Yeah. I'm on it.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.602
You did all this?

17:19.106 --> 17:20.640
It's impressive.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.777
I hope my daughters grow up
to be this capable.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.353
You're a great lawyer,
Lucy, with a great future.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.159
But not everybody is
cut out for trial work.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.764
Are you done with that?

18:00.313 --> 18:01.914
He did not!

18:01.981 --> 18:03.316
Hey.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.584
What do you want from me?

18:04.651 --> 18:05.818
Dad, it's me.

18:05.885 --> 18:06.995
I stuck out my neck for you.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.388
Now you live up...

18:09.822 --> 18:11.391
All right.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.832
What took you so long?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.568
They had to make the shit.

18:30.042 --> 18:35.014
Okay, so I got yours
with no onions.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.583
How you like it.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.554
Dad, you at least have
to take a bite of it.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.855
I will.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.426
You should call a doctor.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.528
I told you,
it's just a panic attack.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.834
You sure your mom's okay
with you staying here?

18:54.901 --> 18:57.069
Yeah, she seemed fine.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.505
Did you ask her?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.208
- No.
- That's what I thought.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.010
Well, she's been
really busy lately.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.612
She's on the phone
more than usual.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.748
How's your mom and, uh,
and your aunt Callie?

19:08.815 --> 19:09.882
How are they doing?

19:09.949 --> 19:12.619
Gross. I don't know. Okay?

19:12.685 --> 19:15.222
- I don't ask.
- I don't blame you.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.392
Can you watch anything else?

19:19.459 --> 19:22.395
Yeah. Rudy or High Noon.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.439
You sure you're okay?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.674
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.279
Well, you look good.
So...

19:39.346 --> 19:42.582
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.722
And for what it's worth,
I'm proud of you.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.058
I was going to let a bitch

- Okay.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.286
Laser focused. Okay?

22:00.387 --> 22:01.521
- Pee less.
- Right.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.498
The Honorable
Rosten Keller presiding.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.732
Oh, here we go.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.301
The Estate of
Ryan Larson, et Al,

23:22.368 --> 23:24.604
versus Borns Technology.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.472
Parties are present, Your Honor.

23:26.473 --> 23:29.075
Be seated. Ahem.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.511
This matter is here

23:31.578 --> 23:33.245
for a status hearing.

23:33.312 --> 23:34.481
I'm looking at the file,

23:34.514 --> 23:38.117
but I see very little progress.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.218
I don't like that.

23:39.285 --> 23:40.520
Well, Your Honor,

23:40.587 --> 23:41.888
we've been conducting
depositions

23:41.954 --> 23:43.690
- and taking testimony...
- No.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.558
They've been doing depositions.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.259
In fact, from where I sit,

23:47.326 --> 23:49.729
you've done next to nothing
since we last convened

23:49.796 --> 23:51.831
other than show up
at my house uninvited.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.733
Your Honor,
it would take two years

23:53.800 --> 23:55.711
to go through all the
discovery they dumped on us,

23:55.735 --> 23:58.170
Plus, I'm dealing with
this police matter right now.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.539
It is not my concern.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.641
My concern is this case.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.343
You're not getting two years
to try this case.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.754
I'm not asking for that,
Your Honor.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.147
Listen, this case
either moves forward,

24:08.214 --> 24:10.216
or it stops.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.653
It's time to either put up
or shut up, counsel.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.655
What's it going to be?

24:21.661 --> 24:23.530
Did you hear me, sir?

24:23.563 --> 24:26.866
Yes, sir, I heard you.
Put up or shut up.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.940
The plaintiff chooses put up.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.108
I beg your pardon?

24:36.175 --> 24:38.210
We call ready for trial.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.411
What are you doing?

24:41.948 --> 24:44.884
We're not ready
for trial, Your Honor.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.153
Why not? You've got
about a million lawyers

24:47.219 --> 24:48.420
working on this.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.222
I call ready for trial.

24:50.289 --> 24:53.760
This is a dangerous game
you're playing, Mr. McBride.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.828
You haven't gone
through the discoveries.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.730
You haven't deposed
their witnesses.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.231
Well, I have a pretty good idea

24:59.298 --> 25:00.567
what they're gonna all say.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.044
Do I understand this correctly?

25:02.068 --> 25:04.837
You're ready to proceed
to trial now, today.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.906
Yes, sir, that's correct.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.843
- Miss Senate?
- This is ridiculous.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.578
If he says he's ready for trial,

25:12.579 --> 25:13.859
the court takes him at his word.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.181
This is a stunt.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.247
Your Honor,

25:16.282 --> 25:17.650
he is alleging negligence,

25:17.717 --> 25:19.585
which necessitates
more discovery

25:19.586 --> 25:21.153
with respect to duty of care.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.388
This will take time.

25:22.454 --> 25:23.823
Okay, let's forget negligence.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.158
We'll just go with
wrongful act and fraud.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.794
Excuse me? You're willing

25:27.860 --> 25:30.129
to waive the claims of
negligence against Borns Tech?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.363
That's correct.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.708
That's your strongest
cause of action.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.067
You open yourself up
to malpractice.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.670
Well, instead of going
with an innocent mistake,

25:37.737 --> 25:39.171
we're going to go
with a conspiracy.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.408
You're willing to waive
the negligence claim?

25:42.474 --> 25:43.943
I just did waive it.

25:44.010 --> 25:47.213
They say he killed himself.
We say he didn't.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.615
We say Borns Tech

25:48.681 --> 25:50.616
had him working
on an illegal weapon

25:50.617 --> 25:51.851
that blew him up.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.754
It's very simple.

25:54.821 --> 25:58.457
Your Honor, could I
have a moment to, uh...

25:58.524 --> 26:01.127
- Please.
- ...speak with my...

26:01.193 --> 26:02.194
people?

26:04.363 --> 26:05.765
Okay, thoughts?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.199
Nope, I don't like it.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.635
What are you talking about?

26:08.701 --> 26:10.036
There is no evidence

26:10.102 --> 26:13.039
of any intentional acts
or of a cover-up.

26:13.105 --> 26:16.843
If he's willing to go
with wrongful acts
and fraud, we win.

26:18.911 --> 26:19.846
Mm-mm.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.081
- Ahem.
- Counsel?

26:27.654 --> 26:28.855
Your Honor,

26:28.921 --> 26:31.090
we call ready for trial.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.192
Well,

26:33.259 --> 26:35.194
isn't this interesting?

26:36.829 --> 26:39.165
Call down the voir dire panel.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.669
We're gonna pick us a jury.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.672
What I don't understand

26:45.738 --> 26:47.339
is how you don't warn me.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.709
Well, you haven't been
listening to me.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.443
I wasn't sure
I was going to do it

26:51.510 --> 26:53.713
when we went in.
I had to see
if they were ready.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.047
We're not ready!

26:55.114 --> 26:56.749
- We're not ready.
- They're not, either.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.150
If they were ready,

26:58.217 --> 26:59.719
they would have
brought a whole crew

26:59.786 --> 27:01.053
and a bunch of video equipment,

27:01.120 --> 27:02.822
a bunch more files,
all kind of shit.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.824
So you in no way feel
that this is rushed.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.558
We have no choice.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.136
I mean, I could get
arrested any time.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.062
- Oh, stop.
- Or maybe killed.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.299
Jesus Christ.
Time's not exactly
on our side here.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.603
Tomorrow? Hmm.

27:17.704 --> 27:20.907
The partners
aren't happy, Donald.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.775
I wouldn't call it
exactly a revolt,

27:22.842 --> 27:24.376
but there's definite rumbling...

27:24.443 --> 27:26.746
mostly about the Borns Tech case

27:26.813 --> 27:28.715
and your relationship with Lucy.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.716
That's over,

27:30.717 --> 27:33.953
and the partners'
doubts will pass.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.254
Well...

27:37.724 --> 27:39.491
if...

27:39.558 --> 27:42.161
we win the Borns case, maybe.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.295
Or what?

27:44.931 --> 27:47.166
They'll replace me?

27:47.233 --> 27:50.102
I'd like to meet the man
they have in mind.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.772
Or the woman.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.744
Listen. Please
listen to me, Donald.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.311
People are concerned.

27:59.378 --> 28:03.149
You have been a rock...
stable, rational.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.118
This case has tripped
a wire somewhere.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.555
Ahem.

28:09.621 --> 28:10.790
Oh, my God.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.359
You are more like Billy
than you realize.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.162
You both need someone
to fight and to hate

28:16.228 --> 28:18.831
and to destroy.
You can't just be.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.666
I loved Billy.

28:20.767 --> 28:25.304
I truly did. Once.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.308
We were quite a team.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.245
You couldn't stand him, Donald.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.182
Eventually no, but in the
beginning I loved him.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.317
- Until you didn't.
- Until I didn't

28:38.384 --> 28:40.186
because he was weak,
because he drank,

28:40.252 --> 28:43.189
because he never really
stood for anything.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.957
That's what you do.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.960
People fall,

28:48.027 --> 28:50.062
and you just
let them keep falling.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.031
Oh, come on.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.200
Are you going to help Lucy?

28:54.266 --> 28:56.102
I know that you care about her.

28:56.168 --> 29:00.172
She just might be the one
thing to make you happy.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.507
She made me happy.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.079
But she was weak.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.516
Ahem.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.290
Lawyers are reminded...

29:18.357 --> 29:21.293
opening statements
are not arguments.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.495
They're road maps
to let the juries know

29:23.562 --> 29:25.998
what evidence they can
expect to hear.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.000
Plaintiff has
the burden of proof

29:28.067 --> 29:29.577
and delivers the first
opening statement.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.536
Cool.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.738
Um...

29:32.839 --> 29:34.173
okay, let's do this.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.910
How are you guys doing?

29:40.112 --> 29:43.049
Sorry. I had a little bit
of a kitchen accident.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.052
I was trying to get
an avocado pit out,

29:46.118 --> 29:48.888
and I did the stab method
instead of the chop.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.223
- Took off like half my...
- Ahem!

29:51.290 --> 29:52.892
...but I'm good to go.
I know. I'm here.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.760
I'm here, you're here.
Let's do this, right?

29:54.827 --> 29:56.728
So I am Patty Solis-Papagian.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.565
I represent Jason Larson.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.267
So two years ago,

30:01.333 --> 30:04.370
Ryan Larson, father of Jason,

30:04.436 --> 30:06.705
employee of Borns Tech,

30:06.772 --> 30:09.775
blew up on a boat
owned by the defendant.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.343
What was he doing on the boat?

30:11.410 --> 30:15.081
Well, he was dumping
explosives into the ocean.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.715
Completely illegal.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.550
Now, what were these explosives

30:18.617 --> 30:19.818
that he was dumping? Well,

30:19.886 --> 30:22.254
they were parts
of an illegal weapon

30:22.321 --> 30:24.756
that was being made
by Borns Tech.

30:24.823 --> 30:29.461
we have video of the explosion.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.030
Not only do we have video,

30:31.097 --> 30:32.831
we have the blueprints

30:32.899 --> 30:35.001
and the model of the weapon.

30:35.067 --> 30:39.105
We found them buried
in his backyard.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.840
Guy had them buried
in his backyard.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.842
At the end of the day,

30:43.910 --> 30:46.012
Borns Tech is no good.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.147
They're just no good

30:48.214 --> 30:50.716
because they do dangerous things

30:50.782 --> 30:52.184
with hazardous materials,

30:52.251 --> 30:53.920
and they don't care
who it affects.

30:53.953 --> 30:54.921
They could care less.

30:54.922 --> 30:56.088
And this is a trend

30:56.155 --> 30:58.257
that happens
with big corporations

30:58.324 --> 30:59.324
all the time.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.759
Your Honor?

31:00.826 --> 31:02.161
Ford with the Pinto,

31:02.228 --> 31:04.563
Big Tobacco, NFL with the...

31:04.630 --> 31:07.766
Those cases have nothing
to do with this case.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.536
The jury will disregard.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.737
Please disregard it.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.405
Please disregard it

31:13.472 --> 31:15.942
because that's
exactly what they do

31:16.008 --> 31:18.210
to people like you and me.
We are disregarded

31:18.277 --> 31:21.113
because, unless
we make them money,

31:21.180 --> 31:23.391
- unless you're putting
cash in their pocket...
- Objection.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.317
- Ms. Papagian...
- ...no value to them at all.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.518
Sustained.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.754
Uh, really,

31:28.820 --> 31:30.060
one more time, and you're done.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.557
All right. Well, I am done.

31:31.623 --> 31:32.624
Here's the thing.

31:32.691 --> 31:33.960
They're going to tell you

31:34.026 --> 31:35.995
that Ryan Larson was suicidal.

31:37.763 --> 31:40.232
Absolutely a lie.

31:41.367 --> 31:45.504
In no way was
Ryan Larson suicidal.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.976
Thank you for your time.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.589
Hi.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.492
That was interesting.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.160
It's very impassioned.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.596
The evidence will show

32:10.662 --> 32:14.266
that Ryan Larson
left a suicide note.

32:15.234 --> 32:18.004
Look, Borns Tech
is in the business

32:18.037 --> 32:21.473
of protecting America
from terrorism.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.142
That's what we do.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.177
Let me take this opportunity

32:25.244 --> 32:27.113
to introduce you
to Leonard Letts,

32:27.179 --> 32:28.614
my co-counsel,

32:28.680 --> 32:30.182
and Lucy Kittridge.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.786
Lucy's brother died
in the war effort.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.022
He went overseas,

32:37.023 --> 32:40.026
and he lost his life
to enemy fire protecting

32:40.092 --> 32:41.360
this country

32:41.427 --> 32:44.063
and all the principles
that we hold dear.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.464
Lucy's brother...

32:45.531 --> 32:47.833
- Objection.
- ...wasn't a war profiteer.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.236
He was a patriot.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.938
And so is Borns Tech.

32:53.039 --> 32:56.275
Look, we know that
having a deep pocket

32:56.342 --> 32:58.344
means that sometimes

32:58.410 --> 33:00.912
you get subjected to extortion.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.082
It happens.

33:03.149 --> 33:08.287
But for them
to saddle up a child...

33:08.354 --> 33:11.190
the child of a suicide victim...

33:11.257 --> 33:13.459
Where does it stop?

33:15.327 --> 33:18.164
Well, at the end of this case,

33:18.230 --> 33:20.332
I hope it stops there.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.081
You can go...

33:36.082 --> 33:37.249
prop.

33:41.387 --> 33:45.157
Ryan never talked about
what he was working on,

33:45.224 --> 33:48.794
but I knew it made him
very unhappy.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.196
He was very stressed.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.464
Now, did he ever talk
about killing himself?

33:52.531 --> 33:55.367
No. Never.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.637
After he died, that's what
Borns Tech told me happened,

33:58.704 --> 33:59.705
and I believed them.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.707
Why did you believe them?

34:01.773 --> 34:04.276
Shock, anger.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.578
I wasn't thinking clearly.

34:08.114 --> 34:11.449
It was easier
to blame Ryan somehow,

34:11.516 --> 34:13.252
- and I regret that.
- Right.

34:13.319 --> 34:14.719
You weren't thinking clearly.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.688
Hmm. But clearly well enough

34:16.755 --> 34:19.391
to take an enormous
settlement from Borns Tech.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.427
I had my son to consider.

34:22.661 --> 34:23.661
You told us

34:23.728 --> 34:27.533
that Ryan was unhappy
and stressed.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.667
At work.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.835
Not at home.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.870
I mean, everything okay

34:31.937 --> 34:33.139
with you two at home.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.541
Yes. Pretty much.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.610
Was he unhappy or stressed

34:39.678 --> 34:41.980
about anything
between the two of you?

34:42.047 --> 34:43.382
No.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.532
It's your last chance
to come clean.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.867
I had an affair.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.671
And how did that make him feel?

35:05.737 --> 35:07.839
Sad, maybe?

35:07.906 --> 35:09.575
The reason they're so powerful

35:09.641 --> 35:11.877
is because they got
the resources, you know?

35:13.679 --> 35:18.184
They got investigators
and a shit load of money,

35:18.250 --> 35:20.886
200 or 300 little creeps
running around there

35:20.952 --> 35:22.188
that can search the internet

35:22.254 --> 35:24.956
or research whatever
they need, you know.

35:25.023 --> 35:26.992
Big operation.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.228
They got everything
on everybody.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.363
- Well...
- Sorry I'm late.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.766
Didn't you even know I was late?

35:34.833 --> 35:36.067
We started the trial.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.102
- I'm sorry...
- I know.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.570
I was there for some of it.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.739
It's not going so good
for your team.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.376
I don't know
where this came from

35:44.443 --> 35:46.678
or what it means, so don't ask.

35:47.846 --> 35:48.914
That right there

35:48.980 --> 35:50.616
is the last favor I do for you.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.689
Hi.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.057
How's it going?

35:59.124 --> 36:01.226
Oh, no.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.628
What happened to your hand?

36:02.694 --> 36:03.795
Please go away.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.731
- No?
- Mm-mm.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.433
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.271
Um...

36:13.872 --> 36:15.106
what?

36:15.241 --> 36:17.943
Oh. We got a couple
of creeps, too.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.111
Right.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.581
Okay. So...

36:22.648 --> 36:25.651
these are Stoltz'
military records

36:25.717 --> 36:27.085
from the Marines.

36:27.152 --> 36:29.721
Defense contractors
hire ex-military.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.391
We may be able to connect
him to Borns Tech that way.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.260
Yeah, but Stoltz
was never mentioned

36:34.326 --> 36:36.395
in any of the Borns Tech files.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.664
Oh. We haven't gone
through all of them yet.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.699
Besides, that's not
going to be there.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.602
They'd never
admit that he's theirs.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.274
What is this?

37:05.757 --> 37:08.294
That's part of a Borns Tech
cluster bomb

37:08.360 --> 37:10.128
that just wiped out
all those people

37:10.195 --> 37:11.363
you saw in the other images,

37:11.430 --> 37:13.098
all those women,
children, civilians.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.566
Okay, we move to suppress this.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.001
Yeah, no shit.
I'm sure you do.

37:16.067 --> 37:19.471
Our witness, who happens
to be their ex-employee,

37:19.538 --> 37:21.707
will testify that this
is the finished product

37:21.773 --> 37:24.643
of the model that we found
buried in Ryan's backyard.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.679
Now, they're saying
that they don't make
cluster bombs,

37:27.746 --> 37:29.881
and this proves
that they're lying.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.950
Ms. Senate?

37:32.017 --> 37:34.553
Obviously, these
images are irrelevant.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.954
There are no markings

37:36.021 --> 37:38.123
that identify it as
a Borns Tech product.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.358
There's no reason to think

37:39.425 --> 37:40.959
that our client
had anything to do

37:41.026 --> 37:42.193
with making or selling that.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.695
Our witness will testify

37:43.762 --> 37:46.097
that this was built
to Borns Tech blueprints

37:46.164 --> 37:47.366
and of the Borns Tech model.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.000
Okay, this is trial by surprise

37:49.067 --> 37:50.369
bullshit, Your Honor.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.037
We don't know what that is

37:52.103 --> 37:53.939
- or where it came from...
- Your Honor.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.374
...even if it's real.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.352
You sure it didn't look
familiar to you, Leonard?

37:57.376 --> 38:00.178
Its probative value is
substantially outweighed

38:00.245 --> 38:01.880
by their prejudicial
impact on the jury,

38:01.947 --> 38:04.650
and we've had no time
to review them.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.361
The images are disallowed.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.263
- Oh, come on.
- Why?

38:18.364 --> 38:19.865
Are you kidding me?

38:19.931 --> 38:21.032
It lacks foundation

38:21.099 --> 38:23.635
and is unduly prejudicial.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.737
The images are disallowed.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.907
Judge, are you going
to let me put on
a case here or not?

38:28.974 --> 38:30.376
Mr. McBride...

38:32.444 --> 38:34.846
Mr. McBride,
call your next witness

38:34.913 --> 38:36.382
or rest.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.389
Based on your professional
knowledge and experience,

38:43.422 --> 38:45.424
what do you think
happened to Ryan Larson?

38:45.491 --> 38:47.058
Based on the size
of the explosion

38:47.125 --> 38:48.994
taken from the video
by the fishermen,

38:49.060 --> 38:53.499
it was caused
by a large amount of
the napalm-based fuel

38:53.565 --> 38:55.166
and something else, too:

38:55.233 --> 38:56.502
munitions.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.504
What do you mean?
Do you mean bombs?

38:58.570 --> 39:03.442
We don't like to use
the term "bombs,"

39:03.509 --> 39:04.776
but yes, bombs.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.413
Did Ryan Larson ever
work on cluster bombs?

39:07.479 --> 39:08.747
- Officially?
- Mm-hmm.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.416
Nobody worked on cluster
bombs at Borns Tech.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.718
Officially, we didn't make them.

39:12.784 --> 39:15.887
They're banned,
indiscriminate devices

39:15.954 --> 39:18.223
that killed way too many
civilian women and kids.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.992
So earlier,
Gina Larson testified

39:21.059 --> 39:25.263
that this was found
buried in her backyard.

39:25.330 --> 39:26.798
Can you tell us what this is?

39:26.865 --> 39:29.501
Well, that right there is
a model of a banned weapon

39:29.568 --> 39:31.770
using illegal fuel
and cluster bombs

39:31.837 --> 39:34.039
which Borns Tech developed.

39:34.105 --> 39:38.076
Okay. And with this model

39:38.143 --> 39:39.444
we found these guys.

39:39.445 --> 39:40.588
Can you tell us what these are?

39:40.612 --> 39:42.781
Those are blueprints

39:42.848 --> 39:45.784
for what appears to be
a cluster bomb system.

39:47.352 --> 39:48.720
Thank you. Nothing further.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.722
- Thank you.
- Mr. Berring,

39:50.789 --> 39:52.824
you were fired from Borns Tech

39:52.891 --> 39:55.326
because of mental health issues

39:55.393 --> 39:56.762
relating to fantasy

39:56.828 --> 39:59.197
and occasionally hearing voices.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.832
Okay, but that...
that's... it's...

40:00.899 --> 40:03.168
Yes, amongst other things.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.603
Including anger.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.305
Anger's a big one
for you, isn't it?

40:07.372 --> 40:09.374
You sought revenge
against an ex-girlfriend

40:09.441 --> 40:10.809
for breaking up with you

40:10.876 --> 40:12.687
by posting a video
of the two of you having sex

40:12.711 --> 40:14.746
on the internet
without her consent.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.653
- Isn't that true?
- Yes, it's... it's correct,

40:16.715 --> 40:20.085
but I... I'm deeply... ashamed.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.687
So you get angry,

40:21.753 --> 40:23.689
and you take revenge.
That's what you do.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.323
You did it to a woman
that you loved,

40:25.390 --> 40:27.368
and now you're doing it
to the company that fired you.

40:27.392 --> 40:29.728
- That's not a question.
- No. Here's the question.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.763
Yes or no, the model
on the blueprints

40:31.830 --> 40:33.431
that you were just
talking about,

40:33.499 --> 40:35.767
did any of them have
the Borns Tech name

40:35.834 --> 40:38.369
or any identifying
markings on them?

40:38.436 --> 40:39.805
Not that I know of, no.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.115
They could have been
made by anybody.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.108
I mean, for all we know,

40:43.174 --> 40:45.043
they could be
Ryan Larson's design.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.177
I mean, yes,

40:46.244 --> 40:47.846
but that...

40:47.913 --> 40:50.516
that wouldn't be feasible.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.020
Yes. I suppose so.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.726
Nothing further.

41:19.545 --> 41:20.812
Hi.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.248
I went by your office.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.850
I saw your stuff
was still there,

41:24.916 --> 41:27.052
so I figured you might
have come up here.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.255
Clever of me.

41:34.392 --> 41:35.627
Here.

41:38.296 --> 41:41.700
It's liberating to do
the wrong thing sometimes.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.571
Most of the time.

41:49.775 --> 41:52.678
What generation of feminism
are we up to now?

41:52.744 --> 41:56.214
Fifth wave? Or sixth?
I don't... I've lost count.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.185
I do know that it is still...

42:02.153 --> 42:03.655
really hard.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.957
It takes grit,

42:06.024 --> 42:07.826
resolve.

42:15.066 --> 42:18.670
When I look at you, Lucy,
I see how smart you are

42:18.737 --> 42:21.239
and how hard you work.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.911
I see how much you want it.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.180
But you don't have it.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.516
You don't even begin to have it,

42:31.617 --> 42:34.620
and you never, ever will.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.663
He sent me to tell you
you're fired.

42:44.730 --> 42:46.965
Well, not fired.

42:47.032 --> 42:51.236
If anyone asks, we'll say
you left of your own accord.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.437
We wish you well.

42:52.503 --> 42:55.340
Why do you hate me so much?

42:55.406 --> 42:57.208
I don't hate you, Lucy.

42:57.275 --> 43:00.646
After tonight,
I won't even remember
you were here.

43:24.235 --> 43:26.705
Uh, there were two big booms.

43:26.772 --> 43:30.408
Um, that's the second one.

43:30.475 --> 43:32.678
- You can see the fire.
- Mm-hmm.

43:32.711 --> 43:34.880
All the burning plastic
coming down.

43:36.748 --> 43:39.084
Uh, then came the wave.

43:42.553 --> 43:45.123
The wave that sank your boat.

43:45.190 --> 43:46.091
Yeah.

43:46.157 --> 43:48.493
Now, after the first
time we spoke,

43:48.559 --> 43:49.559
what happened?

43:49.594 --> 43:52.063
This guy came to us...

43:52.130 --> 43:53.732
uh, Karl Stoltz...

43:53.799 --> 43:56.534
and he said that there
was a shipment...

43:56.601 --> 43:58.737
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Sustained.

43:58.804 --> 44:00.338
The jury will disregard.

44:00.405 --> 44:03.341
Why are you dressed
like that, Gabriel?

44:03.408 --> 44:06.711
Uh, after we first talked
to you about the boat,

44:06.712 --> 44:09.380
this guy Stoltz showed up

44:09.447 --> 44:10.716
to set us up on a drug deal.

44:10.749 --> 44:11.917
- Your Honor.
- He framed us.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.184
Why would he do that?

44:13.251 --> 44:15.787
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

44:15.854 --> 44:17.789
Mr. McBride, do you
have any other questions

44:17.856 --> 44:18.857
for the witness?

44:18.924 --> 44:20.391
Yes, sir.
I have plenty more...

44:20.458 --> 44:22.269
about Karl Stoltz, but you
won't let me ask them.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.629
That line of questioning
has been shut down.

44:24.730 --> 44:26.031
Please move on, sir.

44:31.236 --> 44:32.437
Gabriel...

44:35.606 --> 44:36.908
um...

44:38.143 --> 44:41.312
Well, Your Honor,
I'm a little stuck here.

44:41.379 --> 44:43.048
Ms. Senate.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.418
You have no idea

44:47.485 --> 44:49.354
what made that boat blow up,

44:49.420 --> 44:51.056
do you, Mr. Marquez?

44:54.425 --> 44:55.761
Not really.

44:57.162 --> 44:58.563
Thank you.

44:58.629 --> 45:00.565
Officer,
Mr. Marquez is done.

45:00.631 --> 45:03.769
Mr. McBride,
call your next witness.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.772
Mr. McBride.

45:08.673 --> 45:10.008
Mr. McBride!

45:11.810 --> 45:15.013
I... Do you have
another witness?

45:19.350 --> 45:20.852
Yes, your Honor.

45:22.020 --> 45:24.155
The plaintiff would like
to call Wendell Corey

45:24.222 --> 45:25.222
to the stand.

45:30.595 --> 45:33.631
He's not on the witness
list. He's not even here.

45:33.698 --> 45:34.976
He doesn't have to be
on the list.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.501
He's a party to the action.

45:36.567 --> 45:39.204
Mr. Corey
has no information

45:39.270 --> 45:40.806
about what transpired
on that boat.

45:40.872 --> 45:42.808
Oh, that's great.
Let him testify to that.

45:42.841 --> 45:44.843
Your Honor,
this is unfair surprise.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.477
We have the right to call him.

45:46.544 --> 45:49.247
If you disagree,
I'll file
an emergency appeal.

45:49.314 --> 45:50.815
We'll drag this thing
out forever.

45:50.816 --> 45:52.326
We can talk about it
all day if you want.

45:52.350 --> 45:54.820
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

45:56.822 --> 45:58.356
Get Mr. Corey in here.

45:58.423 --> 45:59.690
Your Honor...

45:59.825 --> 46:02.293
we respectfully ask for time

46:02.360 --> 46:05.563
to consider filing a motion
to preclude this testimony.

46:05.630 --> 46:08.033
I respectfully
deny your request.

46:08.099 --> 46:11.569
Get Mr. Corey in here.
Now!

46:11.636 --> 46:14.172
So I got to put my ass
in the hot seat now?

46:14.239 --> 46:15.740
He has nothing.

46:15.841 --> 46:16.851
Really? You sure
of that, huh, Donald?

46:16.875 --> 46:17.876
I am.

46:17.943 --> 46:19.710
What if he does have something?

46:19.845 --> 46:20.745
Huh?

46:20.846 --> 46:21.913
You know what I suggest?

46:21.980 --> 46:23.281
I'd suggest
we give these fuckers

46:23.348 --> 46:25.183
$10 million and get
this over with now.

46:25.250 --> 46:27.052
Try not to be stupid, Wendell.

46:27.118 --> 46:28.553
Lord knows you're capable of it.

46:28.619 --> 46:31.056
And don't go weak on me

46:31.122 --> 46:32.690
after all I've done for you.

46:32.757 --> 46:34.525
Donald...

46:34.592 --> 46:35.894
After all you've done for me.

46:35.961 --> 46:38.196
You condescending asshole.

46:38.263 --> 46:40.598
How about the nearly
billion dollars in fees

46:40.665 --> 46:42.133
we've paid you over the years?

46:42.200 --> 46:46.004
When you illegally
tested and developed items

46:46.071 --> 46:48.406
to get a jump on the market,

46:48.473 --> 46:53.778
I protected you from clear
and massive violations

46:53.879 --> 46:56.581
of Federal rules
and regulations!

46:58.349 --> 47:00.251
You know what?
Whatever you did,

47:00.318 --> 47:01.953
you got paid for it, didn't you?

47:02.020 --> 47:04.222
We made mistakes.

47:04.289 --> 47:05.323
Okay?

47:05.390 --> 47:07.392
But I'll tell you
what we didn't do.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.995
We didn't kill anyone.
How about you, Donald?

47:10.061 --> 47:12.163
Did you kill anyone?

47:12.230 --> 47:13.331
No.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.701
- Don't tell me...
- Hey.

47:16.767 --> 47:18.503
- You fucking asshole.
- Wendell.

47:18.569 --> 47:22.240
You know what? You're out
of your fucking mind, Donald.

47:22.307 --> 47:24.475
I'm going to shove that
riding crop up your ass.

47:24.542 --> 47:25.776
How about that?

47:25.911 --> 47:28.513
Fuck you, Donald!
I know who you are.

47:28.579 --> 47:29.981
Remember that.

47:30.916 --> 47:32.951
I know who you are.

47:41.659 --> 47:43.061
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:43.128 --> 47:44.762
I forgot my charger in there.

47:44.829 --> 47:45.997
Oh, okay.

47:46.064 --> 47:48.066
Yeah, and I
brought you something.

47:48.133 --> 47:50.135
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.971
- For me, huh?
- Uh-huh. For you.

47:53.038 --> 47:54.639
Drum roll...

47:54.705 --> 47:56.975
♫ Da da da ♫

47:57.042 --> 47:58.944
Nice.

47:58.977 --> 48:01.546
With real cane sugar.
It's your favorite.

48:01.612 --> 48:03.014
Yeah, it's the real thing.

48:03.081 --> 48:04.682
It's warm, but it's still good.

48:04.749 --> 48:06.827
That's all right.
I'll put it in the fridge
in a little bit.

48:06.851 --> 48:08.653
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.524
I thought today
went pretty good.

48:13.591 --> 48:14.592
Right?

48:20.131 --> 48:22.067
Anything I can do to help?

48:25.870 --> 48:27.238
Uh...

48:28.606 --> 48:30.275
shoot me.

48:30.341 --> 48:31.376
Come on.

48:33.844 --> 48:35.380
You're okay, right?

48:36.581 --> 48:37.615
Uh...

48:42.120 --> 48:44.122
I don't even know anymore.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.394
You're really good
at this, Billy.

48:51.029 --> 48:52.597
You're going to be great.

48:57.602 --> 48:59.170
Okay. well,
if you don't need me,

48:59.237 --> 49:00.438
then I got a date.

49:02.373 --> 49:04.609
So see you tomorrow.
Okay?

49:05.710 --> 49:06.710
Yeah.

49:09.714 --> 49:11.582
Good luck, baby.

49:14.385 --> 49:16.687
I thought you forgot
your charger.

49:16.754 --> 49:19.557
Oh. Yeah.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.626
I'm such an idiot, right?

49:21.692 --> 49:23.061
It's been a really long day.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.429
- Yeah.
- God.

49:25.496 --> 49:26.597
I hear you.

49:40.911 --> 49:41.846
Good morning.

49:41.912 --> 49:43.948
Good morning,
Mr. Corey.

49:44.049 --> 49:46.151
Wendell's fine.

49:47.118 --> 49:48.286
As I understand it,

49:48.353 --> 49:50.321
you make a lot of money
by killing people.

49:50.388 --> 49:52.657
We're defense contractors.

49:54.059 --> 49:55.226
We employ Americans

49:55.293 --> 49:57.995
that build the tools
to defend the country.

49:58.063 --> 50:00.331
Hmm. And you also
sell these tools

50:00.398 --> 50:02.367
to Russia and China
and Saudi Arabia

50:02.433 --> 50:04.069
and Yemen, places like that.

50:04.135 --> 50:05.836
If the price is right.

50:05.903 --> 50:07.648
The United States government
authorized those sales.

50:07.672 --> 50:10.141
A couple of those countries
are partners of ours

50:10.208 --> 50:11.542
in the war on terror.

50:11.609 --> 50:13.078
Now, part of this money you made

50:13.144 --> 50:14.779
came from the sale
of napalm, am I right?

50:14.845 --> 50:16.381
Napalm's not a banned weapon.

50:16.447 --> 50:18.416
If you use it
against civilians it is.

50:18.483 --> 50:20.151
We don't use it
against civilians.

50:20.218 --> 50:21.698
So you sell it
to a bunch of countries

50:21.752 --> 50:23.454
who do use it against civilians.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.156
- Objection.
- May I?

50:25.223 --> 50:26.623
This is all on public record.

50:26.657 --> 50:27.657
My aunt could find it.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.070
There's been another
partners meeting.

50:29.094 --> 50:30.228
- Sustained.
- Sustained?

50:30.295 --> 50:32.430
W-We were just talking
about this

50:32.497 --> 50:34.141
- two minutes ago.
- Those countries are not

50:34.165 --> 50:35.866
relevant to this case,
Mr. McBride.

50:35.933 --> 50:37.034
I was getting to something.

50:37.102 --> 50:39.036
Objection sustained.

50:39.104 --> 50:42.873
So, banned or not,
would you agree

50:42.940 --> 50:45.310
that it's illegal

50:45.376 --> 50:47.745
to test napalm off
the coast of Santa Monica?

50:47.812 --> 50:48.879
We don't do that.

50:48.946 --> 50:51.082
But you've done it in the past.

50:51.149 --> 50:53.918
You know what? A lot
of defense contractors

50:53.984 --> 50:55.853
tested various toxic materials

50:55.920 --> 50:57.388
in the past.
We don't do it now.

50:57.455 --> 50:59.690
Do you make cluster bombs?

50:59.757 --> 51:01.192
We're not licensed to, no.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.128
Okay. So in other words,
if you got caught

51:03.161 --> 51:04.595
making them or testing them,

51:04.662 --> 51:06.964
then you'd be fined
or go to prison or both.

51:07.031 --> 51:08.466
Objection.
Argumentative.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.635
You know what?
I already told you this.

51:10.701 --> 51:13.404
We never tested
or made them. Okay?

51:13.471 --> 51:16.941
Then why did Ryan Larson have
a model of a cluster bomb

51:17.007 --> 51:19.277
- buried in his backyard?
- Objection, Your Honor.

51:19.344 --> 51:21.746
- Lacks foundation.
- Sustained.

51:27.352 --> 51:28.919
Mr. Corey, all the rules

51:28.986 --> 51:33.524
about what fuel and weapons
can be made or tested

51:33.591 --> 51:35.393
are waived
during wartime, right?

51:35.460 --> 51:37.695
So our troops get all
the weapons they need

51:37.762 --> 51:38.896
to fight the bad guys.

51:38.963 --> 51:41.299
No. No. I mean,
a lot of them.

51:41.366 --> 51:45.035
Congress can pass what's
called a Wartime Suspension Act

51:45.170 --> 51:48.239
and give us room
to make what we need,

51:48.306 --> 51:51.175
regardless of the legal
ramifications, yeah.

51:51.176 --> 51:53.778
So hypothetically,
you could get a waiver

51:53.844 --> 51:55.780
to test napalm in the ocean

51:55.846 --> 51:57.315
or to build cluster bombs,

51:57.382 --> 51:58.659
even though that's
against the law.

51:58.683 --> 52:01.552
Hypothetically,
I suppose we could, yes.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.020
Who would apply
for those waivers?

52:03.087 --> 52:05.223
You and who else?

52:05.290 --> 52:06.757
Our lawyers.

52:06.824 --> 52:08.959
Hmm. So Mr. Letts
right here,

52:09.026 --> 52:10.328
Mr. Leonard Letts?

52:10.395 --> 52:12.697
Actually, no, not Mr. Letts.

52:12.763 --> 52:14.499
Well, he's your general counsel,

52:14.565 --> 52:16.367
so if it's not him, who is it?

52:17.935 --> 52:19.370
Donald Cooperman.

52:20.638 --> 52:23.208
- Donald Cooperman?
- Yeah.

52:23.274 --> 52:26.477
So if you wanted to get
one of these waivers

52:26.544 --> 52:30.047
to test napalm
or build a cluster bomb,

52:30.114 --> 52:32.049
who would you ask?

52:32.116 --> 52:33.751
Donald Cooperman.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.986
Did he ever allow Ryan Larson

52:36.053 --> 52:37.588
or anyone else at Borns Tech

52:37.655 --> 52:40.958
to design or make cluster bombs?

52:41.025 --> 52:42.227
I have no idea.

52:42.293 --> 52:44.795
Who would know?

52:44.862 --> 52:46.231
Donald Cooperman.

52:47.432 --> 52:48.966
Did a man named Karl Stoltz

52:49.033 --> 52:51.969
ever work for Borns Tech
or any of its subsidiaries?

52:52.036 --> 52:54.672
No. I mean,
not that I recall.

52:54.739 --> 52:56.641
Which one is it,
no or you don't recall?

52:56.707 --> 52:58.707
You know what? A lot of people
work for Borns Tech.

52:58.743 --> 53:01.246
Thousands. I can't
keep track of all of them,

53:01.279 --> 53:02.847
and I don't recognize that name.

53:02.913 --> 53:04.249
Hmm.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.083
Recognize that guy?

53:06.150 --> 53:08.786
No. Huh-uh.

53:11.256 --> 53:12.399
You're not looking at it, sir.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.058
- How would you know?
- Sure I am.

53:14.124 --> 53:17.628
Do you think it's possible
that he was a former Marine

53:17.695 --> 53:20.531
who worked for your
subsidiary in Dubai?

53:20.598 --> 53:23.868
Employee ID number 32823?

53:23.934 --> 53:25.270
Handled security over there,

53:25.336 --> 53:26.696
and then he came
back to the States

53:26.737 --> 53:29.139
- to work for you here?
- I don't have any idea.

53:29.274 --> 53:30.975
Who would know for sure?

53:31.041 --> 53:33.444
Main counsel
for personnel matters.

53:34.445 --> 53:36.013
Donald Cooperman.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.282
Once again, Donald Cooperman.

53:38.283 --> 53:41.486
Mr. McBride, do you
have any more questions
for this witness?

53:41.552 --> 53:43.521
Oh, no, Your Honor,
I don't. I'm sorry.

53:43.588 --> 53:46.290
I... I think he's said
all he's going to say.

53:46.291 --> 53:47.771
We just have one more
witness to call.

53:47.825 --> 53:49.960
We'd like to call Donald
Cooperman to the stand.

53:52.930 --> 53:54.299
Fuck.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.337
Jesus.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.741
Billy can't make you testify.

54:03.808 --> 54:07.445
The attorney-client privilege
absolutely prevents it.

54:07.512 --> 54:12.917
Well, Callie must have
showed him how,

54:12.983 --> 54:14.885
but Wendell opened the door.

54:14.952 --> 54:16.186
To what?

54:16.321 --> 54:18.323
He claims that I advised them

54:18.389 --> 54:19.924
that they could break the law.

54:19.990 --> 54:21.125
Did you?

54:21.191 --> 54:22.393
No.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.931
Doesn't matter.

54:26.997 --> 54:28.666
Does not matter.

54:28.733 --> 54:31.936
They cannot make you
get on that stand.

54:33.404 --> 54:36.707
Make me? Try to stop me.

54:43.348 --> 54:45.082
Me versus Billy.

54:45.149 --> 54:47.418
Once and for all.

54:50.355 --> 54:53.691
♫ Oh, where have you been ♫

54:53.758 --> 54:56.794
♫ Billy boy, Billy boy? ♫

54:57.862 --> 55:01.065
♫ Oh, where have you been... ♫

55:03.768 --> 55:05.503
♫ Charming Billy? ♫

55:06.837 --> 55:09.574
♫ I have been to seek a wife ♫

55:09.640 --> 55:13.978
♫ She's the joy of my life ♫

55:14.044 --> 55:18.916
♫ She's a young thing
and cannot leave her mother ♫

55:44.041 --> 55:45.275
Who is it?

55:45.410 --> 55:47.011
It's Callie.

55:56.787 --> 55:58.523
Hi, Billy.

55:58.589 --> 56:00.891
Hey. What's up?

56:03.260 --> 56:04.529
Am I interrupting?

56:04.595 --> 56:08.432
No. I was just playing
cards by myself here.

56:08.433 --> 56:10.435
Nothing too exciting.

56:11.769 --> 56:14.038
What, you're not going
to invite me in?

56:16.707 --> 56:18.443
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

56:24.649 --> 56:27.552
So this is the infamous
Ocean Lodge.

56:28.453 --> 56:29.687
Yeah, infamous

56:29.754 --> 56:32.289
is a pretty good way
to put it, I'll say.

56:32.356 --> 56:34.559
- Have a seat.
- No, I'm all right.

56:34.625 --> 56:36.126
I'm not staying.

56:36.193 --> 56:39.163
I just came to drop this off.

56:39.229 --> 56:41.131
Thought I would do it in person.

56:41.198 --> 56:43.133

56:46.203 --> 56:47.672

56:49.039 --> 56:50.541
It's our witness list.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.812
Good luck, Billy.

56:56.246 --> 56:57.482
Yeah, you, too.

58:57.267 --> 58:58.769
You stinker!
