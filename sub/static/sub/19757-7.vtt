00:08.376 --> 00:10.127
[indistinct chatter]

00:11.128 --> 00:14.340
Hey, guys, hang in with me here.
We're almost done, okay?

00:15.341 --> 00:17.718
So everyone at the party
will be gathered round.

00:17.801 --> 00:20.888
And then they'll dim the lights.
And then I'll say,

00:20.971 --> 00:25.684
"The most exciting merger in broadcast
entertainment has now come to pass.

00:25.768 --> 00:28.646
Gravity Satellite Radio is now...

00:28.729 --> 00:30.606
[digital sound effects]

00:31.524 --> 00:32.900
Gravity Subzero."

00:33.817 --> 00:35.420
Sounds like the reason an astronaut died.

00:35.444 --> 00:37.655
"We don't know what to do.
He was in Gravity Subzero."

00:37.738 --> 00:39.448
Truman. I can't.

00:40.198 --> 00:42.075
- I can't with you right now.
- [softly] Sorry.

00:42.660 --> 00:43.720
All right, that's all for now.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.413
[indistinct chatter]

00:45.496 --> 00:47.373
- Mickey, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

00:50.918 --> 00:51.919
What's up?

00:52.628 --> 00:54.797
These guys don't get it.
This is a merger.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.006
Staff is gonna get cut.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.301
Have you heard who?
'Cause I nominate Ken in IT.

00:58.384 --> 01:01.178
He takes these nasty shits,
and then he doesn't flush.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.098
- I kind of respect it as a power move.
- This is not a joke.

01:04.682 --> 01:07.851
A lot of people are gonna get fired.
And we are not immune,

01:07.935 --> 01:10.228
because those Subzero guys
are fucking ruthless.

01:10.313 --> 01:14.066
So smart, strong women like us,
we need to stick together.

01:14.149 --> 01:16.527
Yeah, of course. I...
Whatever you say.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.653
Uh, what's the plan?

01:17.736 --> 01:19.322
Well, we're gonna get in there,

01:19.405 --> 01:21.132
and we're gonna make sure
they know who we are.

01:21.156 --> 01:23.576
And have them associate
a face with a name,

01:23.659 --> 01:25.828
because faceless people
are the ones that get screwed.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.621
That's really smart.
That's like...

01:27.705 --> 01:29.457
That's what hostage negotiators do.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.459
They... they humanize the captives.

01:31.542 --> 01:32.835
It's like, "I'm Erika.

01:33.502 --> 01:37.255
I'm Erika. I just bought a camper.
Know me."

01:37.340 --> 01:38.591
"I'm Mickey.

01:38.674 --> 01:40.384
Um, uh...

01:40.468 --> 01:44.179
I have a lot of debt and a bad habit
of buying expensive T-shirts."

01:44.972 --> 01:46.532
- All right.
- "You'll grow to love me."

01:46.557 --> 01:47.808
That's pretty good.

01:47.891 --> 01:48.892
Mickey.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.812
Uh, sorry, Erika, I need to speak
with Mickey for a moment.

01:51.895 --> 01:53.897
Just need to borrow her for a sec.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.150
Promise to bring her back unharmed.

01:56.233 --> 01:58.026
Right... right in the... Right now?

01:58.110 --> 02:00.153
Uh, yeah, just...
I gotta get in the studio.

02:00.237 --> 02:01.238
- So...
- Great.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.156
[sighs] So what's up?

02:04.074 --> 02:05.743
So, uh, you wanna...
you wanna sit down?

02:05.826 --> 02:06.952
No.

02:07.035 --> 02:08.871
No, you're right.
It's better if we stand.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.705
Uh... [sniffles]

02:10.788 --> 02:13.417
Okay, so it's about the party.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.461
How to put this gently?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.714
I'm so sorry, but I'm bringing a plus one.

02:18.797 --> 02:21.008
- Great.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:21.091 --> 02:22.676
Come on, Mickey.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.803
Don't say, "Great,"
and walk out like that.

02:24.887 --> 02:27.180
- It's okay if it stings a little bit.
- It doesn't sting.

02:27.848 --> 02:28.849
Really?

02:28.932 --> 02:31.143
I slept with you
because I thought it would save my job,

02:31.226 --> 02:32.353
and it was a mistake.

02:32.436 --> 02:34.938
Sure. Repressed emotions
are something I'm very familiar with.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.582
I deal with it all the time on my show.

02:37.149 --> 02:39.109
- I'm gonna be honest with you.
- Please.

02:39.192 --> 02:40.318
You disgust me.

02:40.403 --> 02:41.862
[chuckles] Oh...

02:42.780 --> 02:43.780
Wow.

02:44.197 --> 02:47.660
It is just very interesting
how we choose our words,

02:47.743 --> 02:49.345
and how we express
those words in order to...

02:49.369 --> 02:54.291
I'm so looking forward to meeting
your plus one, if she exists.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.544
Well, she does.
Her name is Patricia,

02:56.627 --> 02:59.463
and she's a pretty fuckin' big deal
in young adult publishing.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.214
Are you bringing anyone?

03:01.298 --> 03:03.551
Excuse me!
Great talking with you! Great!

03:03.634 --> 03:05.761
Glad we could connect on that.

03:05.844 --> 03:07.846
You're really good at communicating!

03:09.097 --> 03:10.808
[muffled screaming]

03:12.059 --> 03:14.061
[theme music playing]

03:35.458 --> 03:36.542
How do I look?

03:36.625 --> 03:39.127
Hopefully like somebody
you wouldn't want to fire.

03:39.211 --> 03:41.589
Wow. You look great. Beautiful.

03:41.672 --> 03:43.549
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I wouldn't fire you.

03:43.632 --> 03:44.967
- Thanks.
- [both chuckle]

03:45.843 --> 03:50.138
[sighs] I didn't realize I was gonna have
to schmooze so much to save my job.

03:50.222 --> 03:51.515
[sighs] Oh. That's cool.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.809
Oh, just as a heads-up,

03:53.892 --> 03:55.644
I have never brought a guy
to one of these,

03:55.728 --> 03:57.563
so people may be staring at you.

03:57.646 --> 04:00.524
Okay. So, um...

04:00.608 --> 04:03.235
[smacks lips] how we gonna
introduce ourselves?

04:03.318 --> 04:05.654
Uh, I just thought
we'd say we were dating.

04:06.572 --> 04:07.573
Okay.

04:09.282 --> 04:12.285
- You didn't like that?
- No! No, I don't care. I...

04:12.369 --> 04:16.164
I was actually trying to say that "okay"
as, like, neutral as possible, you know?

04:16.248 --> 04:18.128
I don't want to be too freaked out
or too eager.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.002
So, no, that's... that's good.

04:20.084 --> 04:21.353
- I mean... Yeah.
- Dating. Yeah.

04:21.378 --> 04:23.380
We don't have to, like, put a label on it.

04:23.464 --> 04:28.010
But I just sort of assumed
that we're not sleeping with other people.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.094
I mean, I'm not.

04:29.845 --> 04:30.846
I'm not either.

04:30.929 --> 04:32.681
And if somebody asks, I'll just say,

04:32.765 --> 04:36.894
"This is Gus. I could fuck other dudes,
but I choose not to."

04:36.977 --> 04:40.481
[chuckles] Great.
And I'll say, "Hi, I'm Gus.

04:41.273 --> 04:42.691
I'm the only guy she's fucking."

04:42.775 --> 04:43.817
- [Mickey] Mmm!
- Mmm-hmm.

04:54.369 --> 04:55.555
- [Mickey] Okay.
- [Gus] It's cool. Yeah.

04:55.579 --> 04:57.831
Just tell me if you're miserable,
and, like, you can go.

04:57.915 --> 05:00.268
- I swear. I'll put you in an Uber.
- [chuckles] I won't be miserable.

05:00.292 --> 05:01.478
- I'll pay for it.
- It's fine.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.022
- No. No, don't worry about me.
- Okay.

05:03.086 --> 05:05.463
- Don't worry about me.
- Oh! There's Truman.

05:05.548 --> 05:08.676
- Mickey!
- Hi! That is that girl, Lilly.

05:08.759 --> 05:11.011
- Remember I told you that day I had...
- Right. Right.

05:11.094 --> 05:12.930
- Yes, yes. Hi, guys!
- Hey!

05:13.013 --> 05:15.348
[Mickey] So good to see
the two of you together...

05:15.432 --> 05:17.726
still. Lilly, uh...

05:17.810 --> 05:19.645
Isn't this the worst?

05:19.728 --> 05:22.272
I hate this lame shit.
I'm a corporate whore.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.775
- [all laugh]
- We all are. [chuckles]

05:24.858 --> 05:26.068
Who's this?

05:26.151 --> 05:29.279
Oh. Uh, this is Gus.
Sorry to be so rude.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.864
Uh, he's my husband.
We're married.

05:30.948 --> 05:32.783
Ah, Gus! The Gus?

05:32.866 --> 05:34.492
Yeah, that's right. Hey!

05:34.577 --> 05:36.870
Oh. Uh, Erika's waving at me.

05:36.954 --> 05:38.831
So I gotta go.
Are you gonna be all right?

05:38.914 --> 05:40.332
Yeah, do your thing. Totally.

05:40.415 --> 05:42.710
Don't worry about Gus.
We're gonna take good care of him.

05:42.793 --> 05:45.003
- Aw.
- Thanks. [chuckles]

05:45.838 --> 05:47.756
[upbeat music playing]

05:51.677 --> 05:52.678
You cool?

05:53.596 --> 05:54.597
Yeah.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.723
Okay.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.605
- [Megan] Hi. Whose list are you on?
- [Chris] Hey.

06:02.688 --> 06:04.773
Oh. Uh, it's Mickey.
She works here.

06:05.357 --> 06:06.567
Yeah, I need a last name.

06:06.650 --> 06:09.069
Oh, uh... Ah, shit, I don't remember.

06:09.152 --> 06:11.864
Um, she's, um... she's blonde.

06:11.947 --> 06:14.658
Uh, like, um,
really kind of healthy-looking.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.534
Like, I feel like it could be,
like, Baker?

06:16.619 --> 06:18.411
Uh, if you could look on there for Baker,

06:18.495 --> 06:22.040
or it could easily be Jones, I feel like.
Could you just look in there for Jones?

06:22.124 --> 06:24.710
Yeah, you can't just guess
all existing names.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.754
It's Mickey Dobbs.

06:26.837 --> 06:29.506
[chuckles] Oh, hey, I remember you.
We met at Gus' party.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.549
- Hello! I'm Bertie Bauer.
- Hi!

06:31.634 --> 06:32.843
[Chris] Ah, cool.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.762
Uh, yeah, and Chris Czajkowski.

06:34.845 --> 06:37.264
Um, it's, uh, spelled just like it sounds.

06:37.347 --> 06:39.474
C-Z-A-J-K... Owski.

06:39.557 --> 06:41.810
- Oh. Yeah, I see it. Okay.
- Oh, yeah, it's right there.

06:41.894 --> 06:43.287
- Go right in.
- [Bertie] Thank you so much.

06:43.311 --> 06:46.982
[Chris] Oh, wow. Cool. Blue carpet!
That's even cooler than red.

06:47.065 --> 06:48.776
[pop music playing]

07:03.874 --> 07:07.335
[Patricia] Enjoying myself, saying hello,
meeting your coworkers...

07:07.419 --> 07:10.539
[Dr. Greg] Yeah, fine. Do that. But don't
do everything else that you're doing.

07:10.588 --> 07:12.090
What is the problem here?

07:12.174 --> 07:15.552
My problem is that you are my plus one
and you are flirting with my coworkers.

07:15.636 --> 07:19.556
- [Patricia] I'm having fun. And I flirt.
- [Dr. Greg] You are embarrassing me.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.600
Wow! We've been here
less than 20 minutes, okay?

07:22.685 --> 07:25.270
If I am such an embarrassment,
maybe I should just go.

07:25.353 --> 07:26.604
Okay. Relax.

07:26.689 --> 07:29.942
You enjoy whatever your version of fun is.

07:30.025 --> 07:31.777
Are you...
You're seriously leaving? Really?

07:31.860 --> 07:33.611
Holy shit!

07:36.239 --> 07:37.240
Hi.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.366
Hey.

07:40.077 --> 07:43.580
- Sorry, I didn't mean to pry or whatever.
- No, it's all right.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.249
I have a fascinating life. I know.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.836
It's hard to take your eyes off of it.

07:48.919 --> 07:50.045
[groans]

07:50.128 --> 07:51.672
I'm Dr. Greg Colter.

07:51.755 --> 07:55.926
Oh! Okay.
I thought I recognized your voice.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.262
Oh. Well, it's always nice to meet a fan.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.890
Yeah. I, uh, listened to your show before.

08:01.974 --> 08:04.642
- Oh.
- I heard that one where the, um,

08:04.727 --> 08:08.521
woman called in about her mother-in-law,
who, like, wanted the key to her house...

08:08.605 --> 08:11.859
Oh, God!
What a fucking Oedipal mess that was.

08:11.942 --> 08:14.111
- That was crazy.
- Yeah, well, you really helped her.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.570
I was listening, and I was like,

08:15.653 --> 08:17.823
"This guy's doing his job." [chuckles]

08:17.906 --> 08:19.324
That's the thing about people.

08:19.407 --> 08:23.912
They gotta realize is that no matter
how mundane their lives seem to be,

08:23.996 --> 08:26.206
usually they are deeply fucked up.

08:27.290 --> 08:29.042
Which, case in point...

08:29.126 --> 08:31.754
[chuckles] Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

08:31.837 --> 08:33.171
You from the New York team, or...

08:33.255 --> 08:35.924
No. No, no,
I'm, uh, somebody's date.

08:36.008 --> 08:37.384
- Oh.
- Yeah.

08:37.467 --> 08:44.307
I got to say, it is surreal, like,
hearing your voice come out of your mouth.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.769
I know you probably get that,
like, all the time, but...

08:46.852 --> 08:49.479
- I hear it here and there.
- Ah, you get it a lot.

08:49.562 --> 08:50.731
- I bet you do.
- [chuckles]

08:50.814 --> 08:52.083
- And I don't mean in a bad way.
- I do.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.191
No, no, no. No, no.

08:53.275 --> 08:54.943
No, I mean your voice matches your...

08:55.027 --> 08:56.278
- head.
- No, I...

08:56.361 --> 08:58.238
I take it as a compliment. Truly.

08:59.281 --> 09:01.784
- Hey, man, I like you. [chuckles]
- Yeah.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.787
Hey, you know,
usually when I, uh, go to a party,

09:03.869 --> 09:07.247
I just meet one person who's interesting,
then I, like, latch on to them.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.416
- [chuckles] That's what I do.
- You mind if I latch?

09:09.499 --> 09:12.002
- Oh, uh, of course. Latch away.
- [chuckling] Okay.

09:12.085 --> 09:16.339
So, like, how are you liking LA so far?
Like, you got to be loving it, right?

09:16.423 --> 09:19.259
Oh, well,
sometimes I actually get really sad.

09:19.342 --> 09:23.555
Aw. Well, I can only imagine.
I mean, you're so far from home, right?

09:23.638 --> 09:25.515
Mmm-hmm, 9,300 miles.

09:26.224 --> 09:27.434
[exhales heavily] Wow!

09:27.517 --> 09:29.352
If something happened,
it would take me,

09:29.436 --> 09:31.729
realistically,
three days to get back to them.

09:31.814 --> 09:34.441
Okay, that is the lifespan of a cricket.

09:34.524 --> 09:37.194
I just saw a whole Nat Geo on that.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.655
Yeah. If my family sent me
a cricket for my birthday,

09:40.738 --> 09:42.532
by the time it arrived, it would be dead.

09:42.615 --> 09:45.243
Yeah, I guess. Do the...
Is that a cultural thing?

09:45.327 --> 09:47.620
Like, you send crickets or something?

09:47.704 --> 09:49.331
No, you brought up crickets,

09:49.414 --> 09:52.334
and I had brought up the three days,
and that was the connection.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.297
Right. Yeah. No, I thought it maybe
was an Australian thing or something.

09:55.378 --> 09:59.007
When I heard we were merging with you guys
at Subzero, I was so excited,

09:59.091 --> 10:03.345
'cause you bring
that real East Coast energy to the table,

10:03.428 --> 10:05.472
- and I'm from Jersey, so I get it, and...
- Jersey.

10:05.555 --> 10:07.557
Um, I think you're gonna keep us cool.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.726
New York is actually
where radio got its start.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.811
[Erika] Oh.

10:12.938 --> 10:16.608
You know, I think that, uh, this is
a good deal for all of us involved.

10:16.691 --> 10:19.361
I think we should all celebrate this,
'cause we're all winning.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.321
[Mickey] All right. Let's cut the shit.
Right?

10:21.404 --> 10:23.698
- [chuckles]
- Let's get right down to it.

10:23.781 --> 10:25.718
Are you gonna fire everybody
in the West Coast branch?

10:25.742 --> 10:27.535
Oh. I... I mean, we...

10:27.619 --> 10:29.955
We wish we could keep everybody.
We really do.

10:30.038 --> 10:31.581
Oh, shit. I was kidding.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.459
[chuckles] Oh. Yeah, I know.
Like, we joke about it all the time.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.962
It's, uh... it's...
it's just how we keep going.

10:38.588 --> 10:39.828
- [Erika] Cool.
- [Mickey] Uh...

10:39.882 --> 10:42.926
- The reality, but... we persevere.
- Yeah. Um...

10:44.219 --> 10:48.015
Well, we just wanted
to introduce ourselves to you.

10:48.098 --> 10:50.183
I'm Erika, of course. We've met.

10:50.267 --> 10:52.060
We know each other now. Erika...

10:52.144 --> 10:53.811
Two nephews.

10:53.896 --> 10:57.732
We're just so excited to be part
of the Subzero Gravity family.

10:57.815 --> 10:59.776
- I'm gonna go to the bar.
- Yeah.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.920
You know what I was thinking?

11:00.944 --> 11:04.322
You dodged a freaking bullet last week
for not being here.

11:04.406 --> 11:06.074
Because everyone had the flu.

11:06.158 --> 11:08.035
Everyone in LA had the flu!

11:08.118 --> 11:10.787
It was kind of funny
if you didn't have the flu.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.915
I didn't have it,
so I was looking at everyone like,

11:12.998 --> 11:16.960
"Oh, boy! What a shit-a-thon!"

11:17.044 --> 11:21.881
Yeah, it's like, I don't even know
what the point of feelings are from a...

11:21.965 --> 11:24.384
I don't know, like,
an evolutionary point of view.

11:24.467 --> 11:25.885
- [chuckles]
- Right? Wouldn't...

11:25.969 --> 11:28.931
wouldn't we have a better chance
at survival if we didn't have feelings?

11:29.014 --> 11:33.977
No. We are here to connect.
We exist to coexist.

11:34.061 --> 11:38.523
Oh, I like that. Yeah. "Exist to..."
Okay. That's fascinating.

11:38.606 --> 11:41.026
I love that.
I should listen to your show more often.

11:41.109 --> 11:42.694
Blue cheese with endive?

11:42.777 --> 11:45.280
Oh, um... yeah. Thank you.

11:45.363 --> 11:47.407
- Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yeah.
- All right. Yeah.

11:49.701 --> 11:50.702
Ugh!

11:52.370 --> 11:54.957
- I don't like blue cheese.
- Then why'd you take it?

11:55.040 --> 11:57.960
Uh, I don't want to make her feel bad.

11:58.043 --> 11:59.962
Sometimes I worry, like,
it hurts their feelings

12:00.045 --> 12:02.714
if you don't take their hors d'oeuvres
or something. [chuckles]

12:02.797 --> 12:04.091
Interesting.

12:04.174 --> 12:07.385
I know. I know.
It's... it's a little people-pleasey.

12:07.469 --> 12:11.431
No. Just interesting.

12:12.224 --> 12:16.269
It's like, I'm German,
and I'm Catholic, I'm Midwestern.

12:16.353 --> 12:18.039
It's like a Neapolitan of repression.
[chuckles]

12:18.063 --> 12:20.898
[laughs] Right.

12:20.983 --> 12:22.859
Yeah, I got to say, it is, like,

12:22.942 --> 12:25.487
so refreshing to be able
to talk to you this way.

12:25.570 --> 12:30.367
Just, like, talk to a guy in a way
that's open and vulnerable and sincere.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.453
It's, uh... it's very rare, you know?
Can I say that?

12:33.536 --> 12:35.413
- Is that...
- Yeah, you can and you should.

12:35.497 --> 12:38.375
I feel like I wanna hug you or something.
Would that be weird?

12:38.458 --> 12:41.294
I think it would be weirder if we didn't.

12:41.378 --> 12:43.505
- Ah! Come here!
- [Gus] All right. Ah.

12:44.714 --> 12:46.674
- [Dr. Greg grunts]
- Why can't guys do this?

12:46.758 --> 12:48.676
- [sighs] God! That's good.
- [grunts]

12:49.594 --> 12:50.678
Uh, hello! Hi!

12:50.762 --> 12:53.348
- [chuckles] Hey.
- Hey!

12:53.431 --> 12:54.516
Hi.

12:55.267 --> 12:57.352
- Hello... Hi.
- Hi.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.481
Oh. You two are, uh...

13:01.564 --> 13:05.693
Oh, yes.
Uh, Mickey is, um, my mom.

13:05.777 --> 13:07.987
- [all chuckle]
- Oh.

13:08.071 --> 13:11.783
Can I, uh, steal you? I want you to meet
some other people that I work with.

13:11.866 --> 13:13.951
Uh, okay. Yeah. Sure.

13:14.036 --> 13:16.329
Mickey. We gotta go.
The Subzero guys are leaving.

13:16.413 --> 13:17.830
[Mickey] I... Can I get one minute?

13:17.914 --> 13:19.517
[Erika] Are you kidding me?
Come on. Let's go.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.293
- Follow me right now.
- Okay.

13:21.376 --> 13:22.460
I'm good. You should go.

13:22.544 --> 13:24.337
- I'm sorry to leave you again.
- It's okay.

13:25.713 --> 13:27.150
But I'll be back in, like, one minute.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.974
- Yeah.
- [Dr. Greg] Don't worry. Don't worry.

13:29.051 --> 13:30.760
- Thank you.
- I'll talk his ear off.

13:31.761 --> 13:33.263
Okay. Bye.

13:34.139 --> 13:35.723
[both chuckle]

13:35.807 --> 13:36.974
Right.

13:37.059 --> 13:38.351
[softly] Yeah.

13:42.105 --> 13:45.233
I wanted to live by the beach,
but I rushed into a place in Silver Lake.

13:45.317 --> 13:47.735
Yep. That's, like, such an LA thing.

13:47.819 --> 13:50.947
It's so easy to get just swept up
by the city, you know?

13:51.030 --> 13:54.409
Yeah, and I rushed into a relationship
with the first guy who asked me out.

13:55.118 --> 13:57.204
I mean, like... yeah, Bertie.

13:57.287 --> 13:59.581
There's, like,
ten million people in this city,

13:59.664 --> 14:02.375
and you, like, narrow it down to one guy,
like, super quick?

14:03.042 --> 14:04.395
- Huh.
- He seemed all right at first.

14:04.419 --> 14:05.962
But then, uh, we took mushrooms,

14:06.045 --> 14:08.340
and he kept talking about his urge
to murder me.

14:08.423 --> 14:10.133
And then just people generally.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.177
Okay, that's a red flag.

14:12.260 --> 14:15.222
You know your true soul is revealed
when you're trippin' on shrooms.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.391
I feel like I've made
a lot of really major life decisions

14:18.475 --> 14:21.436
and maybe they were very bad ones.

14:21.519 --> 14:26.191
You know, the statement that you just made
is, I feel like, a profound one.

14:26.274 --> 14:27.484
Yeah.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.445
I normally don't say stuff like this,
because it's so sad.

14:30.528 --> 14:32.614
It's 'cause of my personality. Yeah.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.857
You know, I'm a waiter, and people feel
like they can just, like, open up to me.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.619
It happens at the steak house
all the time.

14:37.702 --> 14:41.498
Right. I guess sometimes people
really need to go to those dark places.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.874
Yeah. I mean...

14:43.791 --> 14:46.794
I mean, I never do.
But maybe I should.

14:46.878 --> 14:49.339
Yeah. I mean, who's your waiter?

14:50.090 --> 14:52.217
Huh. Never even thought of that.

14:53.135 --> 14:56.638
I can't keep just taking the orders.
Sometimes I have to give the orders.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.223
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:58.306 --> 15:01.601
And the orders are the things
that make you sad, right?

15:02.477 --> 15:04.437
Well, for being a waiter,
the orders are the food.

15:04.479 --> 15:05.522
- Right.
- Yeah.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.190
But... but... Yeah.

15:07.899 --> 15:11.068
You like truth, don't you, Gus?
Huh? [chuckles]

15:11.153 --> 15:14.906
I like truth. Yeah, truth and honesty
are pretty crucial to me.

15:14.989 --> 15:17.242
- Yeah.
- Sincerity, too.

15:17.325 --> 15:18.451
Yeah. All that. All that.

15:18.535 --> 15:20.412
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.

15:21.496 --> 15:23.956
- So are you in love with her?
- Who, Mickey?

15:24.624 --> 15:27.264
I mean, if you feel uncomfortable
with this, I don't need to press.

15:27.335 --> 15:29.563
We can either talk about it,
or we can change the subject.

15:29.587 --> 15:31.423
No, no. Wow. I guess...

15:31.506 --> 15:34.967
you know, we haven't known each other
very long, but I do...

15:35.927 --> 15:38.846
I really like her.
Like, really, really like her.

15:41.349 --> 15:42.350
Mickey?

15:42.434 --> 15:44.018
Yes, Mickey.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.103
Because you know her so well?

15:46.771 --> 15:47.772
Uh...

15:49.106 --> 15:50.483
Yeah. What...

15:51.943 --> 15:54.571
- Did your tone just change? Uh...
- Did my tone just change?

15:54.654 --> 15:55.947
I feel like your tone changed.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.590
- Really? That's what you think?
- Yeah.

15:58.116 --> 15:59.784
Yeah, there was definitely a tone change.

15:59.867 --> 16:02.579
- That's very perceptive, Gus.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.872
And that's one of the things
I like about you.

16:04.956 --> 16:06.999
- How perceptive you are.
- So what is it?

16:09.419 --> 16:11.045
What's the big secret here?

16:11.128 --> 16:13.923
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know. Tell me.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.883
Anger. Interesting.

16:17.302 --> 16:18.970
Okay. I'm gonna go.

16:19.053 --> 16:22.265
I mean, it was nice chatting with you.
Loved meeting you.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.684
I think I'm just gonna feel out the rest
of this party.

16:24.767 --> 16:25.977
- [sighs]
- But thanks.

16:27.312 --> 16:28.355
It's sexual!

16:35.695 --> 16:37.905
What? Did she sleep with somebody at work?
Is that it?

16:37.989 --> 16:39.269
She slept with somebody at work.

16:43.578 --> 16:45.037
I fucked her, Gus.

16:45.955 --> 16:47.290
I fucked Mickey.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.960
I fucked her against her dresser.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.169
Okay. That's enough.

16:52.254 --> 16:54.464
The point is she's a fucking user, Gus.

16:54.547 --> 16:58.092
Mickey used me to keep her job.

16:58.175 --> 17:01.388
She is using you. She doesn't like you.

17:01.471 --> 17:03.723
You're just another schmuck in a...

17:03.806 --> 17:07.310
in a long line of schmucks
that she sleeps with

17:07.394 --> 17:10.771
to make her feel
like her life means something.

17:12.022 --> 17:14.383
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Maybe I don't.

17:14.858 --> 17:17.362
Or maybe I see the truth of the situation.

17:17.444 --> 17:19.906
Your situation. My situation.

17:19.989 --> 17:23.660
Every idiot's fucking situation that falls
for that game.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.869
You think you have something special here?

17:25.953 --> 17:27.431
I thought I had something special, too,

17:27.454 --> 17:29.957
but it turned out
it wasn't special at all.

17:30.875 --> 17:34.170
And in two weeks,
when she's moved on to the next schmuck,

17:34.254 --> 17:36.756
you're going to be left with nothing.

17:36.839 --> 17:37.840
Fuck you.

17:41.303 --> 17:43.137
- [sighs]
- Yeah.

17:57.151 --> 17:58.152
Hi.

17:59.195 --> 18:00.195
Hey.

18:00.697 --> 18:02.198
You having a good time?

18:03.074 --> 18:04.116
Yep. Mmm-hmm.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.621
Sorry that I dragged you to this party
and then just left you by yourself.

18:08.705 --> 18:09.789
It's okay.

18:10.748 --> 18:11.958
It's all right.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.335
Are you upset?

18:13.418 --> 18:14.461
No.

18:16.879 --> 18:20.132
- Are you just hungry?
- Mmm-hmm. I guess so.

18:20.216 --> 18:22.594
Hey, can I just get
another one of these, please?

18:22.677 --> 18:24.220
- [bartender] You got it.
- Thanks.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.805
Yeah, I must be hungry or something.

18:30.101 --> 18:32.019
What'd you and Dr. Greg talk about?

18:33.813 --> 18:34.897
Nothing.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.109
- What?
- What? I don't...

18:39.026 --> 18:40.320
Yeah.

18:40.403 --> 18:42.739
- I'm not either. I'm having a good time.
- Okay.

18:51.247 --> 18:54.667
Truman just texted me. He needs some help,
so I'm gonna go.

18:55.627 --> 18:57.754
Sorry to leave you again.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.506
[smacks lips] It's okay.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.425
All right. I'll... I'll see you in a few.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.306
Gator, coming in. Watch out.

19:09.391 --> 19:12.309
- I'm sorry.
- Gator. From <i>Gator and Ken.</i>

19:12.394 --> 19:14.186
That's a... show?

19:14.270 --> 19:17.148
Yeah, I'm the one who always says,
"Pencil me out."

19:17.231 --> 19:19.484
[chuckles]

19:19.567 --> 19:20.568
What a night.

19:20.652 --> 19:24.071
You're just by the bar, you don't expect
to meet the Gator, and boom.

19:24.155 --> 19:25.257
Here I am. We're having a chat.

19:25.281 --> 19:26.949
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

19:27.033 --> 19:28.618
That's a big shot, there.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.913
- [sighs]
- Having one of those nights, huh?

19:31.996 --> 19:34.832
Gator, I don't know who you are.
I've never heard your show.

19:34.916 --> 19:37.919
Social media. You probably get
on social media, you'd find us.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.630
Good to meet a fan.
Future fan, at least.

19:44.509 --> 19:45.885
What did you tell him?

19:47.219 --> 19:50.473
[scoffs] Wow. Lot of emotions
coming up tonight, huh?

19:50.557 --> 19:53.142
Yeah. 'Cause you're
a narcissistic piece of shit

19:53.225 --> 19:55.328
who has to stick your nose
into everybody else's business!

19:55.352 --> 19:56.396
What are you trying to do?

19:56.479 --> 19:58.440
Let me explain to you something, Mickey.

19:58.523 --> 20:01.443
I deal with the real,
and I help people heal.

20:01.526 --> 20:04.361
That's just something
you say on the radio.

20:04.446 --> 20:07.990
- You're a fake radio therapist!
- Really?

20:09.701 --> 20:11.744
Well, okay. Maybe I am.

20:11.828 --> 20:13.913
Maybe I'm a fake radio therapist.

20:13.996 --> 20:17.459
Or maybe I'm somebody
who has got your fucking number.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.794
And I'll... tell you what I did tonight.

20:19.877 --> 20:21.838
I saved two people.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.675
I saved that poor man-child from being
another fucking victim of yours!

20:25.758 --> 20:30.888
And I saved you from getting even farther
away from what you really fucking feel!

20:30.972 --> 20:32.223
Get this out of my face!

20:33.683 --> 20:35.560
Stay the fuck away from him, okay?

20:35.643 --> 20:37.186
Are you fucking crazy?

20:37.269 --> 20:40.106
He's the best thing
I have going in my life right now.

20:40.189 --> 20:43.317
So just stay the fuck away from me.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.152
I hate you!

20:45.820 --> 20:49.907
Have fun in Bullshitland!
I'll be here when you get back!

20:52.159 --> 20:55.705
I'll tell you, I moved out here
to be a stuntman, you know?

20:55.788 --> 20:58.225
The other day somebody asked me,
"How long have you lived in LA?"

20:58.249 --> 20:59.667
And I immediately said two years.

20:59.751 --> 21:02.879
But then when I fucking thought about it,
I've been out here for four years.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.422
And in that whole time,
you haven't got any stunt work?

21:05.507 --> 21:09.802
No. Because it's not even about
what you know in this town,

21:09.886 --> 21:11.804
it's about who you know, you know?

21:11.888 --> 21:14.932
That's why I'm here tonight.
To try to make connections and network.

21:15.016 --> 21:17.560
But, oh, yeah, that really seems
to be fucking working.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.480
Well, it seems to me that radio
would have the least number of stunts.

21:21.523 --> 21:24.526
And it's like, I'd be fine
with my stunt career being nowhere

21:24.609 --> 21:25.985
if I had a great personal life.

21:26.068 --> 21:28.070
But, oh! I don't have
a great personal life either.

21:28.154 --> 21:31.365
[stammers] I'm always depressed,
and I just mask it.

21:31.448 --> 21:33.785
You don't have any time
to have a good personal life,

21:33.868 --> 21:36.913
'cause you're trying to be a stuntman,
which is not working out at all.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.165
Yeah. Bullshit, you know?

21:39.248 --> 21:41.018
- I'm 31 years old right now, right?
- Uh-huh.

21:41.042 --> 21:43.670
- Even if I meet my soul mate tomorrow...
- Unlikely.

21:43.753 --> 21:48.174
Right. By the time my son or daughter
graduates from college,

21:48.257 --> 21:49.425
I'll be old, and they...

21:49.509 --> 21:52.178
I probably won't even be able
to go skiing with them. [sighs]

21:52.261 --> 21:54.471
These are the last great days
of my boobs.

21:55.389 --> 21:58.267
My future husband
will never see my boobs at their best.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.561
[sighs]

22:01.771 --> 22:03.022
I'm just, like, bummed out now.

22:03.105 --> 22:06.025
- Yeah, I feel really sad.
- Yeah, me too. [sighs]

22:06.108 --> 22:08.319
- Hey!
- Hey.

22:08.402 --> 22:09.696
Finally ran into you.

22:10.738 --> 22:11.739
[sighs]

22:12.574 --> 22:13.991
What's up?
What's going on?

22:14.075 --> 22:16.327
I'm feeling a little wiped out.

22:16.410 --> 22:17.829
Thanks for inviting me, Gus.

22:19.706 --> 22:20.790
Great party.

22:30.925 --> 22:31.926
Hi.

22:32.802 --> 22:34.553
- Hey.
- So...

22:35.722 --> 22:37.402
I know what you and Dr. Greg talked about.

22:37.473 --> 22:38.557
Oh.

22:39.141 --> 22:40.726
That wasn't my finest hour.

22:40.810 --> 22:44.897
But you and I weren't even dating then,
so I don't get why you're mad at me.

22:46.190 --> 22:52.446
'Cause he said, like, everything I'm,
like, worried might be true. I don't know.

22:52.529 --> 22:54.531
What? What... what did he say to you?

22:55.658 --> 22:58.661
He said you didn't really like me,
and that... [takes deep breath]

22:58.744 --> 23:00.496
you were just using me, and that...

23:01.580 --> 23:03.833
what we had wasn't special.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.627
- What?
- I mean, is that true?

23:05.710 --> 23:08.295
No, it's not true.
Why would you listen to him, anyway?

23:08.379 --> 23:11.423
He's not a real doctor.
He's like Dr. Phil.

23:11.507 --> 23:14.927
- Dr. Phil's not a real doctor?
- Whatever. That's beside the point.

23:15.011 --> 23:16.595
Dr. Greg isn't my therapist.

23:16.679 --> 23:19.390
I haven't, like, told him
my deepest, darkest secrets.

23:19.974 --> 23:22.852
He's an asshole anyway,
and he's jealous, okay?

23:22.935 --> 23:24.687
[stammers] He's...

23:26.188 --> 23:27.564
Fuck that guy!

23:28.357 --> 23:29.441
Yeah.

23:42.079 --> 23:44.332
Do you wanna just, like,
dance or something?

23:46.208 --> 23:47.209
- Come on.
- Okay.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.377
Let's do it.
