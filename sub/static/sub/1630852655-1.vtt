01:32.080 --> 01:34.000
this is a police message.

We need your assistance.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.360
We are evacuating this
area due to a threat.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.200
- Hot enough for you?

01:40.280 --> 01:41.280
(Joel chuckles)

01:41.360 --> 01:44.040
- They've requested two EXPOs
on this job. Must be big.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.560
- Either that or they've
got their doubts about you.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.000
Where are we going?

01:47.080 --> 01:48.520
- Up there.
- Nutkins.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.160
You know DI Desai from SO15.
She's in command of the op.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.960
- Inspector Robins,
this is Lana Washington.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.040
I don't think you two have-
- We are acting on intel.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.480
There's a dangerous individual preparing

01:57.560 --> 01:59.840
a bomb factory in these flats.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.680
- The flat is leased to Andy Phelan,

02:01.760 --> 02:04.080
located on the fourth floor
in the south building.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.200
- [Robins] We need to move.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.800
Stay behind us.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.920
- [Joel] Right.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.440
- What a charmer.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.240
Kit up?
(Joel chuckles)

02:12.320 --> 02:14.360
- Just need my balls and the disruptor.

02:14.440 --> 02:15.200
(Lana laughs)

02:15.280 --> 02:18.600
- [Carney] All right, get ready lads.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.080
- [Officer] We ask you,
for your own safety,

02:20.160 --> 02:22.080
to immediately vacate the premises

02:22.160 --> 02:25.080
and calmly make your
way to the nearest exit.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.840
My policemen will guide
you to a safer area.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.800
- Ta.
- Come on.

02:35.880 --> 02:36.640
(fastener rips)

02:36.720 --> 02:38.520
- [Officer] We ask you,
for your own safety,

02:38.600 --> 02:40.440
to immediately vacate the premises.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.440
- [Officer] We are
about to move the cordon

02:42.520 --> 02:45.120
to the east side of the estate.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.760
- Yeah.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.800
Great. Tres chic.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.960
- Come on.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
- Oh, come on, you've got to use your own.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.280
- They're my lucky pair. Come on.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.800
(fastener rips)

02:56.880 --> 02:58.880
Thank you.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.400
- Good?
- Okay.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.280
- Great.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.680
- [Robins] Flat 127
identified as a bomb factory.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.840
- [Joel] Yeah.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.120
- [Robins] Silent approach.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.360
(footsteps pattering)

03:23.800 --> 03:26.560
(hand taps)
(footsteps pattering)

03:26.640 --> 03:29.320
(siren wailing)

03:31.480 --> 03:34.040
- [Officer] This way. This way.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.600
That's it. Come on.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.360
(siren wailing)

03:47.760 --> 03:52.760
(hand taps)
(footsteps pattering)

03:56.240 --> 03:58.920
(hands tapping)

04:00.760 --> 04:02.520
(door bangs)

04:02.600 --> 04:03.560
(door crashes)

04:03.640 --> 04:04.800
(smoke grenade clatters)

04:04.880 --> 04:06.440
(explosion booms)

04:06.520 --> 04:07.600
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

04:07.680 --> 04:09.160
- [Officer] Armed police! Nobody move!

04:09.240 --> 04:10.120
- [Officer] Armed police!

04:10.200 --> 04:12.040
Nobody move!
- Armed police!

04:12.120 --> 04:14.120
Don't move!

04:16.200 --> 04:18.040
Hallway clear!

04:18.120 --> 04:20.560
- [Officer] Left backdoor!

04:20.640 --> 04:22.880
- [Officer] Right backdoor!

04:24.040 --> 04:26.200
- [Officer] Kitchen clear!

04:28.040 --> 04:29.920
(blanket rustles)

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
- [Officer] Room clear!

04:33.480 --> 04:34.680
(blanket rustles)

04:34.760 --> 04:35.920
- [Officer] Two clear!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.520
- All clear, sir.
- Roger that.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.680
All clear. You're up.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.120
(Joel sighs)

05:11.160 --> 05:13.600
(Lana sighs)

05:23.920 --> 05:25.920
- [Joel] Wash, Robins. Bedroom.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.760
(bed creaking)

05:43.200 --> 05:44.800
- [Robins] Brown, on me!

05:44.880 --> 05:46.880
Get back! Get back!

05:47.600 --> 05:50.040
Armed police! Come out with your hands up!

05:50.120 --> 05:53.560
(woman whimpering)

05:53.640 --> 05:54.640
Three!

05:54.720 --> 05:55.880
Two!
- Wait, wait wait, wait!

05:55.960 --> 05:57.360
Wait, wait, wait! Look.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.760
Look.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.040
(Lana sighs)
- Oh, my God.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.280
Hey.
- Hey.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.360
- Trojan One here.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.080
We have a woman and a child-
- Let me take that out.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.560
- Needing medical attention.
- Oh, wow.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.400
- [Joel] Don't worry,
I'm just gonna take out-

06:07.480 --> 06:09.240
- No sign of Andy Phelan
or any bomb factory.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.760
- [Samira] Central Seven Four, received.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.200
We'll send in an emergency support unit.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.680
- [Lana] This is a funny
little hiding spot.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.040
- [Angie] Okay.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.040
(cable tie snaps)
- Are you okay?

06:18.120 --> 06:18.880
Are you okay?

06:18.960 --> 06:19.720
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you hurt?

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
- Yeah?
- I'm all right.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.640
- [Joel] Okay. There we go.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.840
(Angie sighs)
- What's your name?

06:24.920 --> 06:25.720
- Evie.
- Evie.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.720
That's a lovely name.
- Hey, Evie, I'm Joel,

06:29.800 --> 06:32.800
and this scary-looking thing is Lana.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.960
But don't worry, we're the bomb squad.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.400
You're safe now.
- Where's Andy?

06:37.480 --> 06:39.480
They made me call the threat in.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.600
They had a gun against her head.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.560
- Who did?
- Is my daddy okay?

06:43.640 --> 06:45.960
- [Carney] EXPO, bathroom, now.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.560
- Wait there, okay?

06:47.640 --> 06:50.640
(suspenseful music)

06:55.160 --> 06:57.160
- [Carney] There.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.200
(flashlight clicks)

07:01.280 --> 07:05.440
(toilet paper rustling)
- Oh, God.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.720
(Joel sighs)

07:12.400 --> 07:14.680
(helicopter whirring)
(people shouting)

07:14.760 --> 07:17.400
(siren wailing)

07:21.240 --> 07:23.240
- You're okay.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.200
- [Robins] We need to take tighter control

07:24.280 --> 07:25.680
of the situation on the ground.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.480
- [Brown] Roger that.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.240
- We've had a first
account from Angie Phelan,

07:28.320 --> 07:29.720
wife of Andy Phelan.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.640
She says she was woken at
4:00 a.m. by masked intruders.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.200
She thinks they used Andy's
keys to get into the flat,

07:35.280 --> 07:37.840
because she heard the front
door and thought it was him.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.000
They told Evie and her

07:40.080 --> 07:42.640
that they'd be killed
if they made any noise.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.280
That's why they were quiet when
your team entered the flat.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.640
- [Robins] Did she ID the attackers?

07:46.720 --> 07:47.800
- They kept their masks on.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.960
She said they spoke a mixture
of English and Arabic.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.160
- [Robins] Arabic?

07:52.240 --> 07:56.320
- Yeah. She says she thinks
they took Phelan's keys.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.160
- [Brown] We need to know
what access they give.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.520
- We had A1 intelligence
of a bomb factory.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.080
Andy Phelan's name was
given. We have to find him.

08:04.160 --> 08:09.160
(helicopter whirring)
(people shouting)

08:13.760 --> 08:16.600
(bottle clatters)

08:30.640 --> 08:32.640
What's the hold-up, EXPO?

08:33.440 --> 08:34.880
- You're gonna have to move the crowd back

08:34.960 --> 08:36.080
before we can go back in.

08:36.160 --> 08:36.920
- We're trying to maintain control

08:37.000 --> 08:39.120
of an increasingly hostile situation,

08:39.200 --> 08:40.640
directly caused by the delay.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.960
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.
- From the looks of the IED,

08:43.040 --> 08:44.280
there's large amounts of HME.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.680
We're gonna need a wider exclusion zone

08:45.760 --> 08:47.760
before we get started.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.240
(radio beeps)
- Command, this is Trojan One.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.560
Look lively and get that
crowd back even further.

08:57.640 --> 08:58.960
- [Command] Received, Trojan One.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.040
- Thanks. We'll crack on.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.600
- [Officer] Residents of Westhaven Estate,

09:07.680 --> 09:09.480
this is a police message.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.400
We need your assistance.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.680
We are evacuating this
area due to a threat.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.560
- [Joel] Take five, mate.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.520
Looks like it could be a big one.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.600
- [Officer] Sir.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.080
- [Officer] Thank you
for your co-operation.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.400
(ominous music)

09:41.280 --> 09:43.640
(bag thuds)

09:56.800 --> 09:59.280
(bag rustles)

10:04.240 --> 10:07.120
(bag zipping)

10:07.200 --> 10:09.200
- [Joel] Right.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.520
Let's see.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.160
Let's see what we can see.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.960
Why have I chosen a job where I spend

10:19.040 --> 10:20.800
so much time on my knees?

10:20.880 --> 10:22.880
- Because you're an idiot.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.640
(Joel sighing)

10:27.720 --> 10:29.720
- Okay.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.080
(Joel sighing)

10:35.800 --> 10:38.400
(device beeps)

10:39.480 --> 10:42.680
(Joel panting)

10:42.760 --> 10:44.360
(device beeping)

10:44.440 --> 10:46.040
(Joel sighs)

10:46.120 --> 10:48.720
(device beeps)

10:49.640 --> 10:51.280
Wash, we've got a pressure plate-

10:51.360 --> 10:52.680
- Okay.
- Underneath this mat.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.520
(device beeping)

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
Let me mark it.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.320
(glow stick cracks)

11:05.400 --> 11:07.240
(glow stick rattling)

11:07.320 --> 11:09.320
There we go.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.960
(Joel sighing)

11:16.960 --> 11:18.400
Right.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.920
(Joel sighs)

11:27.240 --> 11:28.560
(Joel sighs)

11:28.640 --> 11:30.440
We're gonna need to
prep the pulleys, Wash.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.760
- [Lana] Got it.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.840
- Thanks.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.120
(bag zipping)

11:44.440 --> 11:46.920
(bag zipping)

11:48.160 --> 11:50.560
(Joel sighs)

11:55.360 --> 11:56.200
(Joel sighs)

11:56.280 --> 11:59.120
I can't see a bloody thing in here.

11:59.200 --> 11:59.960
- Here you are.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.720
- No, no, no, whoa,
whoa! Wait, wait, wait.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.480
Freeze
- What?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.320
- Hold. Hold, mate.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.040
(Joel sighing)

12:08.120 --> 12:10.120
- [Lana] What?

12:10.200 --> 12:11.640
- [Joel] Oh, shit.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.480
- What, Nut?

12:12.560 --> 12:14.400
- [Joel] Uh, Wash, we've
got a secondary trigger.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.760
- Oh, fuck.
- And I think...

12:17.840 --> 12:22.680
Yeah, it's rigged up to the light switch.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.760
- [Lana] Oh, great.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.680
(people chattering)

12:37.640 --> 12:39.120
- Hold on, hold on-
- No, just run.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.520
Just run, please.
- No, no.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.640
The circuit isn't complete yet

12:41.720 --> 12:42.640
'cause you haven't fully depressed it,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.080
so we've got a couple of seconds.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.440
- Nut, I'm not gonna kill us both,

12:46.520 --> 12:47.440
so please, will you just run?

12:47.520 --> 12:48.280
It's my mistake.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.320
- Well, you're gonna have
to kill us both, mate,

12:49.400 --> 12:50.760
because I'm not going anywhere, all right?

12:50.840 --> 12:52.840
I'm not leaving you.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.160
- [Lana] Fucking hell, Nut.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.960
- Don't move.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.000
You can do it. You can do it.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.800
Don't move. Don't move.

13:01.880 --> 13:02.720
Another trigger, so there has to be

13:02.800 --> 13:05.280
another power source, down here somewhere.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.160
- [Lana] Oh, fuck.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.000
- Found the split.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.480
And the split goes...

13:08.560 --> 13:10.840
- [Lana] Quick as you can, Nut.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.320
- [Joel] Along this plate. Don't move.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.480
- It's not moving, but it's...

13:14.560 --> 13:16.000
- All right, mate, all right.
- My hands are shaking.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.760
- [Joel] All right, hang on, hang on.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.920
- [Lana] You got it?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.600
- [Joel] Okay, it goes into the cupboard.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.080
Okay. Slow, slow, slow.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.120
(Lana groans)

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
Okay, okay.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.840
- [Lana] Nut, will you talk
to me? What can you see?

13:29.920 --> 13:31.720
- [Joel] Yeah, got it. Got it, got it.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.560
(Lana sighs)
- Where is it?

13:32.640 --> 13:34.680
Where is it? Where are you going?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.840
Found the power source.
- Shit, I think it slipped.

13:39.920 --> 13:40.960
- All right, you're all right.
- Fucking slipped.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.480
- You're all right. Don't move your hand.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.560
- My hands are dripping wet, Nut.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.000
- [Joel] Wash, can you get me your mirror?

13:47.080 --> 13:47.920
- What?
- Get me your mirror.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.040
I need your mirror.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.080
I've got my hand on it.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.520
- [Lana] Oh, my God.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.520
- Keep your hand still. You can do it.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.600
(Lana groans)

13:55.680 --> 13:58.160
(Lana panting)

13:58.240 --> 14:00.240
That's it.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.560
Yes, yes. Got it.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.120
What are we looking at here?
- You got it?

14:05.200 --> 14:05.960
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:06.040 --> 14:06.880
Just looking for the...

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
(Lana sighs)
Yeah, standard connection.

14:10.360 --> 14:14.800
Fuck's sake! Uh, have
you got my snips, mate?

14:14.880 --> 14:16.680
- Yeah, mate. They're just in there.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.040
- [Joel] Okay, all right.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.800
- Just be careful.
- All right, easy, easy.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.600
(fastener rips)

14:20.680 --> 14:21.440
- [Lana] I'm so sorry.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.600
- [Joel] You're doing great.

14:22.680 --> 14:23.920
- No, it's gonna slip.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.400
- Okay. All right, all right.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.000
Okay.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.280
Yeah, here we go, here we go. Ready?

14:32.240 --> 14:35.120
Five, four, three, two.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.280
(sparks crackling)

14:36.360 --> 14:38.560
Yes. I've got control.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.560
- Nut?
- I've got control.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.640
- Yeah?
- Got control.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.880
(light switch clicks)

14:47.960 --> 14:49.160
(Joel sighs)

14:49.240 --> 14:50.600
- [Lana] Oh, my God.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.480
Oh, my God.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.520
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.160
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.760
(Joel sighs)

14:56.840 --> 14:58.200
Oh, my God.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.720
Oh, my God.
(Joel sighs)

14:59.800 --> 15:00.560
Oh, my God.
- Do you know,

15:00.640 --> 15:02.000
I didn't think that would work.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.680
- [Lana] You wanker.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.880
(Joel laughs)

15:06.960 --> 15:08.680
- I love you too, mate.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.800
Just not to bits.
(Lana laughs)

15:13.120 --> 15:14.680
Now to give these people a SitRep.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.520
- [Lana] Okay.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.640
- [Joel] Can you tape up for me?

15:16.720 --> 15:18.880
- [Lana] Yeah.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.960
- Tape it.
- Yeah.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.800
- [Joel] Well done. I am
getting too old for this shit.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.080
(Lana sighs)

15:25.160 --> 15:30.160
(Joel sighing)
(siren wailing)

15:32.080 --> 15:34.680
(Lana sighing)

15:39.160 --> 15:40.280
- [Lana] Oh, my God.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.040
- [Joel] Central Seven
Four, from EXPO One.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.280
We found a secondary.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.760
Please maintain radio silence
till we clear the site.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.280
Then we'll disrupt the main charge.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.360
- Central Seven Four, received.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.000
- That was ridiculous.
(flashlight clicks)

15:55.080 --> 15:56.760
(Lana sighs)

15:56.840 --> 15:59.040
That was ridiculous.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.720
(Lana sighing)

16:08.200 --> 16:11.280
(footsteps treading)

16:13.400 --> 16:14.800
- [Joel] All right?

16:14.880 --> 16:16.720
- You seen that?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
What is it?

16:20.240 --> 16:21.680
What do you think that is?

16:21.760 --> 16:23.280
- No idea.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.560
We'll see what
counter-terrorism make of it.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.080
Come on, lazy bones, let's get some air

16:28.160 --> 16:30.200
before we neutralise the device.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.840
(Lana sighing)

16:35.360 --> 16:40.360
(Joel sighing)
(people chattering)

16:54.680 --> 16:55.480
- Have some of that!
(bottle clatters)

16:55.560 --> 16:57.520
- [Officer] Oy! Get back here!

16:57.600 --> 16:59.240
- Sort them out!
- Run, run, run, run!

16:59.320 --> 17:01.240
- [Officer] Come back!

17:01.320 --> 17:03.120
(Lana chuckles)

17:03.200 --> 17:05.200
- Get Danny to get the pig stick.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.920
I'll notify command that
we're making it safe.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.080
We still need to keep everyone well back.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.240
(Joel chuckles)
- Come on.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.120
- What are you like?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.200
(Lana laughs)
(fastener rips)

17:17.280 --> 17:18.040
(Joel sighs)

17:18.120 --> 17:18.920
- They're my lucky pair.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
- Yeah, all right, all right.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.480
- Thank you.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.080
(Joel laughs)

17:26.160 --> 17:29.480
(wire cutters snipping)

17:41.160 --> 17:43.640
(siren wailing)
(birds fluttering)

17:43.720 --> 17:45.840
(Joel sighs)

17:45.920 --> 17:47.960
- [Officer] This is a police message.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.040
We are about to move the cordon

17:50.120 --> 17:52.400
to the east side of the estate.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.800
Can you follow the instructions

17:53.880 --> 17:56.400
of the cordon officer closest to you.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.680
This is for your safety. Thank
you for your co-operation.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.760
(suspenseful music)

18:16.360 --> 18:19.360
(flashlight clicks)

19:00.240 --> 19:05.240
(people chattering)
(siren wailing)

19:09.840 --> 19:11.040
(radio beeps)

19:11.120 --> 19:12.880
- Control, ready to fire.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.240
(radio beeps)
- All set, Lana.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.520
(button clicks)
Preparing control shock

19:16.600 --> 19:18.600
to the shock components.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.000
(radio beeps)
Circuit's good.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.080
Priming.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.680
Stand by! Firing!

19:25.760 --> 19:27.280
(button clicks)
(rocket whooshes)

19:27.360 --> 19:30.200
(rocket clatters)

19:47.200 --> 19:49.200
- What the...

19:51.520 --> 19:52.800
(radio beeps)

19:52.880 --> 19:54.880
Nut, you've gotta come and see this.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.160
Fireworks.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.320
- [Robins] Huh?

20:01.400 --> 20:02.960
- [Samira] What do you mean?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.600
- [Joel] The device's main
charge has been filled

20:05.680 --> 20:07.320
with this black powder here.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.360
- From fireworks?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.520
- [Joel] Uh-huh.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.200
- It's a weak charge. Take off
a couple of fingers, maybe.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.880
- The fact that it's a non-lethal,

20:14.960 --> 20:17.760
low-explosive device,
could be significant.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.640
- Okay.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.320
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.960
(Robins sighs)

20:32.040 --> 20:33.760
- [Officer] Oh, sorry. After you.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.760
- [Lana] Cheers, thanks.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.640
- Thanks.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.960
(both sighing)

20:40.040 --> 20:41.840
You all right?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.800
- Yeah, of course.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.680
Just all that fuss for
a low-threat device.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.440
- I know what you mean.

20:48.520 --> 20:50.680
Listen, why don't you take five in the van

20:50.760 --> 20:52.240
and I'll sort out the
handover to forensics?

20:52.320 --> 20:54.320
- Yeah, nice one.
- All right.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.080
And don't eat my biscuits.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.560
Well, I've counted this pack, so I know.

20:59.640 --> 21:00.880
I know how many is in them.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.960
(hand patting)

21:02.040 --> 21:05.120
Thank you.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.440
(Joel whistles)

21:06.520 --> 21:07.360
(fingers snapping)

21:07.440 --> 21:08.960
(people shouting)

21:09.040 --> 21:11.720
(siren wailing)

21:16.720 --> 21:18.640
- Forensics are going
through Phelan's flat

21:18.720 --> 21:20.360
and there's still no sign of his keys,

21:20.440 --> 21:21.520
so maybe Angie was right

21:21.600 --> 21:23.120
in thinking the intruders took them.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
- [Robins] Why would they want his keys?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.920
- Nutkins?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.440
Be ready to move in five.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.040
We're just checking out the
garage, then we'll convoy out.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.840
- Okay, thanks.

that, your Gitmo playlist?

22:07.520 --> 22:08.800
God, I'd break in two minutes.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.280
- All right, shut up.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.320
- We're moving out in five.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.640
Tell Danny not to run anyone over.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.040
- No, I can't promise anything.

22:14.120 --> 22:17.360
- Mm, speaking of moving out,

22:18.840 --> 22:21.280
I think that me and Jaz
have turned a corner.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.640
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.760
She's even looped me into some DIY.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.640
(both laughing)

22:26.720 --> 22:27.880
Hear this, right?

22:27.960 --> 22:29.520
She takes me to some posh paint store

22:29.600 --> 22:31.680
and shows me this reddy-brown colour.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.360
I think it's called Californian
Sunset or some shit.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.920
Guess what I said?
- Oh, you didn't.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
- I did. I said, "It's interesting.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.480
Last time I saw a room painted
that colour was after a triple

22:41.560 --> 22:44.040
IED detonation in Helmand."
(Lana laughs)

22:44.120 --> 22:45.120
- How did that go down?

22:45.200 --> 22:46.720
- How do you think?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.000
- [Robins] EXPO One, EXPO
Two, this is Trojan One.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.200
Get over here now.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.280
- We've got something.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.040
Pete. Thanks, mate.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.280
- [Robins] We've just
located Phelan's vehicle.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.720
We're treating it as suspicious,

23:04.800 --> 23:07.560
as the stolen keys would've
given the attackers access.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.440
(sheet rustles)

23:10.520 --> 23:12.320
(flashlight clicks)

23:12.400 --> 23:15.080
(sheet rustles)

23:19.480 --> 23:21.480
- Looks clear.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.520
Yep.
(door handles rattling)

23:33.960 --> 23:34.760
Yep.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.960
(door handles rattlings)
- Pass me your torch.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.440
Shit.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.520
(people chattering)

23:52.720 --> 23:53.760
- [Joel] This is EXPO One.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.840
Gonna need that cordon moved
back by at least 50 metres.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.040
Blast zone is gonna be wide

23:58.120 --> 24:00.360
and we've got no idea which
direction it's gonna roll out.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.680
- [Samira] EXPO One, this is
Central Seven Four. Received.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.680
I'll get uniform to push the
cordon back by 100 metres.

24:08.160 --> 24:08.920
- [Officer] Copy that, Control.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.400
Move this cordon back immediately.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.880
- [Robins] We both know the
bombers could be right here,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
watching every move we make.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.360
(people chattering)

24:31.960 --> 24:33.920
- We've located Andy Phelan's vehicle.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.920
EXPO think there's a possible IED,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.160
but, due to the presence
of a secondary device

24:38.240 --> 24:41.120
in Phelan's flat, they're
not taking any chances.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.800
They're deploying the robot,

24:42.880 --> 24:44.560
so we need to maintain ground control

24:44.640 --> 24:46.360
until EXPO give us the all-clear.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.280
Got that?

24:47.360 --> 24:49.360
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.760
(robot whirring)

25:00.120 --> 25:02.880
(robot rumbling)

25:04.480 --> 25:07.320
(people shouting)

25:14.080 --> 25:15.600
- [Officer] Please stay back.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.800
Thank you for your patience.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.920
Please stay back. Do not
try to return to your homes.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.280
- [Robins] Trojan One to EXPO One.

25:23.360 --> 25:28.200
We have the cordon pushed
back to a safe distance.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.000
(robot rumbling)

25:45.800 --> 25:48.280
(Danny sighs)

25:56.320 --> 25:58.560
- Guys, you're in my light.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.160
Okay-
- Here, Danny, I've got this.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.440
- No. Lana, I can do it.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.640
- Danny, take a break.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.480
Go and get a cold drink. Go on.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.120
Go on.
(Danny sighs)

26:15.480 --> 26:17.880
(Lana sighs)

26:20.160 --> 26:22.240
- [Pete] Danny. What's up, mate?

26:24.680 --> 26:27.000
- It just feels like everything
is going wrong today.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.880
- No, they don't mean to put you down.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.000
Look, you'll be fine. Just stick at it.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.360
(robot rumbling)

26:38.960 --> 26:39.760
- Oh, watch the-

26:39.840 --> 26:42.080
- I've got it, I've got it.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
- All right?
- Mm, yeah.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.840
(computer beeping)
(joystick rattling)

26:56.920 --> 26:57.840
(button clicking)

26:57.920 --> 26:59.120
(static crackles)

26:59.200 --> 27:01.200
What's happening?

27:01.600 --> 27:03.040
- Robot's not responding.
(button clicking)

27:03.120 --> 27:04.280
(static crackles)

27:04.360 --> 27:06.360
- [Joel] What?

27:07.320 --> 27:10.080
(robot whirring)

27:18.800 --> 27:23.800
(joystick rattling)
- Only the camera's working.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.600
(button clicks)

27:25.680 --> 27:27.120
- [Samira] EXPO One, this
is Central Seven Four.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.760
What's the SitRep?

27:28.840 --> 27:30.600
(joystick rattling)

27:30.680 --> 27:35.160
- We're just having a little
bit of trouble with the robot.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.280
(door slams)

27:36.360 --> 27:38.360
These things can be temperamental.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.320
(radio beeps)
- Received.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.880
(tense music)

27:49.960 --> 27:52.080
- Lana?

27:52.160 --> 27:54.160
Lana! Oy!

27:56.520 --> 27:58.520
Oy, Wash!

27:59.280 --> 28:04.280
Wash, what you doing?!

28:10.960 --> 28:13.960
(flashlight clicks)

28:16.120 --> 28:18.120
Oh, for...

28:23.800 --> 28:25.800
(radio beeps)
- What is she doing?

28:26.640 --> 28:28.640
(radio beeps)
- Manual check.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.680
(radio beeps)

29:06.760 --> 29:07.720
- Wires are unconnected.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.360
Could be a false alarm, or
someone's playing with us.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.440
- [Joel] Copy that.

29:20.480 --> 29:25.480
(alarm chirping)
(locks clacking)

29:27.880 --> 29:30.560
(Man groaning)

29:34.160 --> 29:36.320
- [Man] Help. Help me.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.400
Help me. Help.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.320
(Man groans)

29:41.400 --> 29:43.440
- Guys, I'm gonna need you
to take hard cover, please.

29:43.520 --> 29:47.040
Hard cover now.
(Man groans)

29:47.120 --> 29:48.600
(Man panting)

29:48.680 --> 29:50.680
- [Man] Help me, please.

29:51.480 --> 29:55.040
- EXPO Two, looks like a proxy
device. Repeat, proxy device.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.040
- This is Trojan One.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.280
We have an unidentified male,
possible suicide bomber.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.800
- Help.
- Right, stand still!

30:01.880 --> 30:05.160
Stay still! Stay fucking still, right now!

30:05.240 --> 30:07.720
I'm bomb disposal. I need you
to stay still for me, okay?

30:07.800 --> 30:09.440
I'm gonna help you!

30:09.520 --> 30:11.600
Listen to me! Please stay still!

30:11.680 --> 30:13.200
(Man panting)

30:13.280 --> 30:14.160
- Help me, please.
- I'm gonna help you,

30:14.240 --> 30:17.360
but I need you to stay really,
really still for me, please!

30:17.440 --> 30:19.440
- [Robins] EXPO Two, get back.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.160
Trojan Five Four, do you
have visual on subject?

30:22.240 --> 30:24.520
- [Costa] This is Trojan Five
Four. I have a clear shot.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.040
- [Robins] Trojan One, received.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.280
- I need you to take off your hood

30:27.360 --> 30:31.000
really, really, really
slowly and carefully, okay?

30:31.080 --> 30:34.560
Stay so still. Remove the
hood as slowly as you can.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.200
Really, really slowly.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.040
- All right.
- Slowly!

30:37.120 --> 30:39.120
- All right.
- Fucking slow!

30:40.760 --> 30:42.560
That's it. Now drop it.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.640
(Man groans)
Shit.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.400
- They grabbed me.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.840
They put me in the car.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.160
- [Joel] I am getting them out

30:52.240 --> 30:53.320
of there now.
- Hold on.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.120
(radio beeps)
EXPO Two, can you get an ID?

30:56.200 --> 30:57.880
(radio beeps)
- Saying he was kidnapped.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.360
He looks like a victim.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.600
- EXPO Two, this is Central
Seven Four repeating.

31:01.680 --> 31:02.760
Can you get an ID?

31:02.840 --> 31:04.680
- What's your name?!

31:04.760 --> 31:06.840
- [Man] Andy. Andy Phelan.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.080
(radio beeps)
- It's Phelan.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.120
- [Robins] Trojan One, received.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.880
Confirmation, we have Phelan.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.680
- Right, Andy, my name's Lana.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.920
I'm gonna help you with the device, okay?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.400
You're in safe hands.
- My wife.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.520
- [Lana] I'm gonna help you.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.600
- My daughter, my family.
- Yeah, they're fine, Andy.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.640
They're fine.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.640
(radio beeps)
- EXPO Two, get back.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.280
- [Lana] Gonna help you, okay?

31:29.360 --> 31:30.640
Stay fucking still, okay?!

31:30.720 --> 31:33.040
- All right.
- Stop moving your hands.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.560
Can you see me?

31:36.640 --> 31:38.360
Look at me. Can you see me?

31:38.440 --> 31:40.160
- I can't breathe.
- Yeah, you can.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.160
You're breathing. You're doing great.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.920
(Andy panting)

31:44.000 --> 31:45.640
(radio beeps)

31:45.720 --> 31:48.840
Nut, I'm gonna deal with the device.

31:48.920 --> 31:49.760
(radio beeps)
- Wash, what are you doing?

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
You don't need to do this. Come on.

31:54.520 --> 31:58.080
- Nut, snipers, get
back now! I've got this.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.400
- [Robins] EXPO Two, stay where you are.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.720
Trojan Five Four, have
you got a clear shot?

32:02.800 --> 32:04.040
(radio beeps)
- This is Trojan Five Four.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.640
Shot is still clear.

32:05.720 --> 32:06.920
- I don't wanna die.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.440
- I know.
- I don't wanna die.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.440
- You're not gonna die.

32:10.520 --> 32:14.120
I'm gonna come close.
Stop moving your hands.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.600
(radio beeps)
- This is Trojan Five Four.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.240
Shot's compromised.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.560
- [Robins] Trojan One to Trojan Five Four.

32:18.640 --> 32:19.880
Just keep him in your sight.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.360
- Right, we're both gonna
walk away from this,

32:21.440 --> 32:22.760
but we need to work together, okay?

32:22.840 --> 32:23.720
- [Andy] Okay.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.120
- So I'm gonna examine the device.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.840
- What? You've done this before?

32:26.920 --> 32:28.440
- Yeah, more times than
you've had hot dinners,

32:28.520 --> 32:30.640
so just, not a muscle, eh?

32:30.720 --> 32:31.880
I'm gonna lift your arms up.

32:31.960 --> 32:32.720
- I can't breathe.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.560
- Just keep breathing.
That's all I need you to do.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.920
Just keep breathing. That's it.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.440
Just so I can take a look. There we go.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.080
(Andy panting)

32:44.480 --> 32:46.120
Okay. You're doing great.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.680
I'm just gonna bring your arms back down.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.800
(Andy whimpering)
Don't shake, Andy.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.360
Keep really still.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
I need you to do me a favour.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.680
Just stay fucking still, mate.
That's all I need you to do.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.680
- Don't go!
- I'm not going anywhere.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.080
I just need to call summat in.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.280
- Don't go!
- I'm right here.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.600
You can open your eyes and see.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.480
I'm right here. Yeah?

33:04.560 --> 33:06.160
- [Andy] Don't leave me.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.000
(radio beeps)

33:07.080 --> 33:08.040
- Someone else is in control of the IED.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.040
There's a mobile phone attached.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.480
- Shit.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.240
- [Robins] Brown, take Green Team.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.640
Check the walkways for spotters.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.880
- [Brown] Received. Carney, let's move.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.560
- [Lana] Nut, spotters, now.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.120
- Copy. Danny, go active on the ECM.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.200
- [Danny] Yeah.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.520
- [Carney] Hands! Show me your hands!

33:29.600 --> 33:30.480
Up, now.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.880
- [Boy] All right, all right, all right.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.520
(Andy crying)

33:40.600 --> 33:43.240
(Andy mumbling)

33:48.440 --> 33:49.520
- Nut, he's losing it.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.600
Bring the kit bag, now. Quick!

33:52.560 --> 33:54.760
- [Robins] Stay there until
we've finished our sweep.

33:54.840 --> 33:55.800
- [Joel] Sorry, mate.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.880
(radio beeps)
On my way.

34:01.520 --> 34:04.440
(buttons clicking)

34:05.520 --> 34:06.840
(radio beeps)
- ECM is active.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.920
We're jamming.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
(radio beeps)
- Brown, any visuals?

34:13.600 --> 34:14.840
- [Brown] This is Trojan Three Six.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.920
Negative here too.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.240
- Took your time.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.320
- I should go.
- No, I'll go.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.680
He trusts me.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.800
Plus, you're getting too old for this.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.120
(Joel chuckles)

34:31.200 --> 34:31.960
- Here you are, Andy, I need you...

34:32.040 --> 34:33.920
Why aren't you staying
still, Andy? Come on.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.280
I've done this a million times.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.360
Andy, stay still. We're
gonna get it sorted, okay?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.000
Just let me get some bits out,

34:39.080 --> 34:40.360
but we've done this a million times,

34:40.440 --> 34:41.640
so just need you to stay really-

34:41.720 --> 34:43.320
(cellphone ringing)

34:43.400 --> 34:45.400
- What?

34:49.560 --> 34:50.320
Please help me.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.440
- Nut, there must be a second phone,

34:51.520 --> 34:52.760
one to arm, one to trigger.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.280
- Phone's ringing, but the
device isn't functioning.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.480
I need eyes on a second trigger phone.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.320
- Andy, can you tell me if there's

34:58.400 --> 34:59.920
another device on you, please?

35:00.000 --> 35:00.880
Talk to me!
- Stay up.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.680
Hey, stay up, stay up, stay up.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.600
- How are they bypassing our jammers?

35:04.680 --> 35:05.440
(radio beeps)
- We need eyes on the caller

35:05.520 --> 35:07.520
before they trigger the second phone.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.040
- [Lana] Nut, there
must be another device.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.280
- [Joel] Must be somewhere.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.680
- Andy, is there anything there?!

35:12.760 --> 35:14.360
- No!
- Got it.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.080
I got the phone, Nut. I've got it.

35:16.160 --> 35:16.920
- I am gonna die!
- No, you're not.

35:17.000 --> 35:17.800
- I've got it, Nut. I've got it.

35:17.880 --> 35:18.640
I've got it.
- Got it, got it?

35:18.720 --> 35:21.240
All right, stay still.
Stay very, very still.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.320
Everything's fine.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.600
- I'm gonna die!
- No, no, no, no.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.760
No, you're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

35:27.840 --> 35:29.600
How are you doing? How are you doing?

35:29.680 --> 35:31.360
- No!
- No, no, no.

35:31.440 --> 35:34.120
Please, don't move. Don't move.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.240
(wire cutters snipping)
(cellphone ringing)

35:36.320 --> 35:38.080
(Andy whimpering)

35:38.160 --> 35:39.640
(Lana sighs)

35:39.720 --> 35:41.720
- [Lana] Clear. Clear.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.920
- Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.120
- [Lana] Clear!

35:46.200 --> 35:47.120
- What happened? What happened?

35:47.200 --> 35:48.160
- [Joel] All right, all right. Easy, easy.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.080
- [Lana] Your prayers were answered, Andy.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.320
- What?
- That's what happened.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.760
- I'm all right?
- Okay.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.440
Stay still. Stand up for me, Andy.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.200
I still need to get the vest off you!

35:56.280 --> 35:57.480
- [Joel] Easy. Please,
please, right there.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.560
- All right.
- Really gently.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.920
You got him, Nut.
- I'm all right.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm all right.
- You're all right.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.120
- Okay.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.800
(Andy crying)
Bend your elbow for me.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.920
Bend your elbow. That's it.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.040
- [Joel] That's it.
Straighten this arm down.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.240
Straighten your arm. Straighten your arm.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.360
There you go.
- Got it.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.720
- Got it?
- Got it.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.160
- Okay. Well done, mate.

36:17.240 --> 36:20.080
Well done. All right,
let's go for a walk, okay?

36:20.160 --> 36:21.840
This way. This way, mate.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.520
All right. Well done, well done.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.440
- [Andy] I'm all right.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.320
- [Joel] You're all
right. You're all right.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.720
All right.
(Andy crying)

36:33.080 --> 36:34.000
- All right?

36:34.080 --> 36:36.080
- [Joel] Yeah.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.880
- [Lana] Medics, on me.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.960
- I need to run a trace on a number

36:49.040 --> 36:51.120
that tried to trigger the
phones on Phelan's vest.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.560
Yeah.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.720
He's arrived now.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.680
I'll brief him after I've had
the first account from Phelan.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.600
(officer chattering)

37:06.080 --> 37:07.480
- DI Thom Youngblood, SO15.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.560
- [Officer] Sir.

37:10.920 --> 37:14.400
(police radio chattering)

37:19.400 --> 37:22.080
- DI Desai said on the
phone an EXPO was involved.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.320
- Yup, she got that right.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.800
- You got a minute,
talk about what you saw?

37:26.880 --> 37:28.880
- Yeah, of course.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.760
The device in the flat was non-lethal,

37:35.840 --> 37:38.880
but this one was well-built,
professionally done.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.480
I was able to separate
the components, just.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.520
- Okay.

37:47.200 --> 37:51.080
We looked into the numbers you
found on the flat wall. 1912.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.280
Didn't flag up any terrorist group.

37:55.960 --> 37:59.000
Phelan's wife, she said the
attackers were speaking Arabic.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.320
You think it's Islamist?

38:05.040 --> 38:07.040
- I don't know.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.680
- I'm glad you're okay, darling.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.400
- I'm a tough nut to crack.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.600
- Mm. You are.

38:23.960 --> 38:28.520
- I mean, it was seconds away
from that device functioning.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.040
I'm pretty sure my luck
is about to run out.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.400
- You was born lucky, Wash. Come on.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.000
Tell you what, mate, she's used up

38:37.080 --> 38:40.520
so many of her nine lives,
she's started nicking mine.

38:40.600 --> 38:44.040
DI Youngblood. Damn, man, how you doing?

38:44.120 --> 38:45.560
In the flesh.

38:45.640 --> 38:46.480
If I'd known a superstar

38:46.560 --> 38:47.920
like yourself was making an appearance,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.760
I'd have made more of an
effort with my outfit.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.600
- You should have done.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.520
(both laughing)

38:53.600 --> 38:55.160
You good?

38:55.240 --> 38:56.920
- Well, my back's gone, wife's gone,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.120
kids aren't talking to me anymore,

38:58.200 --> 39:00.120
but apart from that, I'm fine, yeah.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.200
- All right.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.120
I need to speak to DI Desai,

39:04.200 --> 39:06.200
see what we're dealing with here.

39:06.560 --> 39:11.560
- Cheers, Thom.
- Yeah, see you in a bit.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.000
- "Cheers, Thom."

39:14.080 --> 39:16.520
(Lana chuckles)

39:16.600 --> 39:18.240
He's so dreamy.
- Oh, shut up.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.080
- You could've done
worse. Does he work out?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.040
- Shut up.
- Think he works out.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.800
Do you work out together?
- You're annoying me now.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.200
Shut up.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.160
- Have you...

39:25.240 --> 39:26.440
It's me you're talking to.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.920
Come on, have you-
- I'm saying nothing.

39:29.000 --> 39:29.840
- You little...

39:29.920 --> 39:30.800
(Joel chuckles)

39:30.880 --> 39:32.880
He's a good guy, you know, for SO15.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.200
- Well, it's early days.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.800
He's a bit keen.
- Ah.

39:35.880 --> 39:36.920
- What were you on about with you and Jaz?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I thought everything was going good.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.280
- You know what it's like.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.440
It's two steps forward, one step back.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.360
We'll be all right.

39:46.840 --> 39:47.960
- Come on.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.720
(Joel chuckles)

39:52.280 --> 39:54.400
- I wanna be with them.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.520
I do, I do, Wash, but it's just...

39:58.720 --> 40:00.840
If it's a choice between
the family or the job,

40:00.920 --> 40:02.920
well, then there's no choice, is there?

40:03.880 --> 40:05.880
- You tell me.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.760
Should I have a word with Danny?

40:11.840 --> 40:13.320
- Nah. Nah.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.880
We've all been there.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.160
- [Lana] Huh?

40:16.240 --> 40:18.000
- Come on, mate. I remember
some of your first taskings.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.640
- Ugh.
- You were like a rabbit

40:19.720 --> 40:20.880
in the headlights.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.640
No, he's all right. I'll
speak to him tomorrow.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.840
- [Pete] Grab the door, mate?

40:25.920 --> 40:26.880
- Oh, we're just wrapping up here,

40:26.960 --> 40:29.640
so, as far as we're concerned,
you can collapse the cordon.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.560
- We're just waiting on
one last plate check.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.760
But okay, we'll release the cordon.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.840
- Okay.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.840
(Joel sighs)
- This is a police message.

40:38.920 --> 40:42.920
The area is now secure and
we are removing the cordon,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.840
so it is now safe for
you to enter the area

40:45.920 --> 40:47.080
and return to your homes.

40:47.160 --> 40:51.040
- You know, I was thinking
about that first device, right?

40:51.120 --> 40:52.440
You were really onto something.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.800
Anyone who knows how to
rig up a pressure plate

40:54.880 --> 40:56.560
and attach it to a secondary wouldn't use

40:56.640 --> 40:58.160
a low-explosive charge.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.960
- What, you think they
messed up deliberately?

41:00.040 --> 41:02.160
- I think it was a come on,

41:02.240 --> 41:04.440
to lure us in, make us
evacuate the building,

41:04.520 --> 41:07.040
and give them a bigger
target out here in the open.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.360
How many times have we seen

41:09.440 --> 41:11.440
that exact same tactic in Afghanistan?

41:12.400 --> 41:13.920
- Danny was jamming the entire time,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.160
and they still armed the suicide vest.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.200
(officers chattering)

41:17.280 --> 41:19.440
- [Officer] We are removing the cordon.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.680
- What's going on?
- It is now safe to enter

41:20.760 --> 41:23.280
the area and return to your homes.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.920
Thank you for your co-operation.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.520
(people chattering)

41:28.600 --> 41:30.520
- [Officer] This is a police message.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.400
- [Joel] This the plate
you're checking on?

41:32.480 --> 41:34.160
Give me a minute, will you?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.280
(tape rustling)
- It is now safe for you

41:35.360 --> 41:36.840
to enter the area

41:36.920 --> 41:38.160
and return to your homes.
- Thom.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.000
- [Thom] Yeah.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.480
- We've got a trace on
the phones that attempted

41:40.560 --> 41:42.840
to trigger Phelan's suicide vest.

41:42.920 --> 41:43.680
- Phones?

41:43.760 --> 41:46.880
- Two unregistered burner
phones in separate locations.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.440
- Shit.

41:49.520 --> 41:53.440
- Yeah. It's an organised terror cell.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.640
- [Officer] We're now
just waiting on EXPO.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.080
- [Officer] It is safe
for you to enter the area

41:58.160 --> 41:59.920
and return to your homes.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.680
Thank you for your co-operation.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.640
- Stay back from this van.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.720
Keep everyone else back from this van.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.360
Hey, Wash! Stay back, stay back.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.800
Have you got my snips, mate?!

42:11.880 --> 42:14.040
Wanna check out this van!
- Yeah, coming!

42:14.120 --> 42:15.560
- [Joel] Guys, back up, back up.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.480
(explosion booms)

42:20.960 --> 42:23.640
(alarm wailing)

42:25.960 --> 42:27.040
(horn honking)

42:27.120 --> 42:29.960
(rocks pattering)

42:44.040 --> 42:47.640
(woman screaming)
(Lana groaning)

42:47.720 --> 42:50.560
(people shouting)

42:57.760 --> 43:00.600
(woman screaming)

43:01.520 --> 43:04.360
(people shouting)

43:19.840 --> 43:22.640
(woman screams)

43:22.720 --> 43:25.560
(people shouting)

43:27.560 --> 43:30.200
(woman screams)

43:34.120 --> 43:34.920
(woman coughing)

43:35.000 --> 43:37.680
(Thom coughing)

43:39.880 --> 43:42.640
- Lana!

43:42.720 --> 43:46.120
(Thom coughing)

43:46.200 --> 43:47.480
(Lana groans)
You okay?

43:47.560 --> 43:49.720
You okay?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.880
Lana. Lana, stay here!

43:51.960 --> 43:53.560
Stay here!

43:53.640 --> 43:54.760
Lana!

43:54.840 --> 43:56.680
(Thom coughing)

43:56.760 --> 43:58.560
Lana!

43:58.640 --> 44:00.640
Lana, we gotta move!

44:01.680 --> 44:03.680
Gotta move!

44:12.600 --> 44:13.800
(Thom coughing)

44:13.880 --> 44:15.880
Lana! Don't look!

44:16.560 --> 44:17.760
(Thom grunts)
(Lana groans)

44:17.840 --> 44:21.120
(Thom grunting)

44:21.200 --> 44:23.200
You okay?!

44:23.280 --> 44:24.600
Use your legs! Get up, girl!

44:24.680 --> 44:26.440
Get up! Come on!

44:26.520 --> 44:27.520
Keep moving!

44:27.600 --> 44:28.800
(Lana coughs)
Keep moving, Lana!

44:28.880 --> 44:30.480
Keep moving!
(Lana groaning)

44:30.560 --> 44:33.240
(Thom coughing)

44:35.960 --> 44:38.720
(dramatic music)

45:06.120 --> 45:08.640
(logo chimes)
