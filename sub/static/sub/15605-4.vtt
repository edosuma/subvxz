00:09.760 --> 00:11.520
Ex On The Beach is back.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.480
This time it's all stars.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.080
Old faces return
for another shot at finding love.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.920
Am I looking for love? Fucking yeah!

00:22.000 --> 00:24.080
They'll have to endure their exes...

00:24.160 --> 00:27.000
I've never, ever felt like this
in my life.

00:27.080 --> 00:30.760
Some will have to deal
with old grudges...

00:30.840 --> 00:33.360
You've had more dicks
than I've had sun beds.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.760
And as hard as they try
to find their perfect match...

00:36.840 --> 00:38.880
Right, who wants to finger me?

00:38.960 --> 00:42.480
...standing in their way
will be the Tablet of Terror.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.800
I won't lie,
I'm cacking myself big time.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.960
It's going to be hotter
than ever before...

00:49.040 --> 00:51.080
I wanna ride her. Giddy up, Amy.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.680
...as emotions boil over...

00:53.760 --> 00:57.360
You made me realise there's more
to life than what I was just doing.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.000
...tensions run high...

00:59.080 --> 01:00.960
I fucking dare ya!

01:01.040 --> 01:02.400
Let's fucking go, kid.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.200
...and the claws come out.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.560
(yelling)

01:05.640 --> 01:07.400
(shouting)

01:08.280 --> 01:12.240
So far, five exes have arrived
but whose...

01:12.320 --> 01:14.920
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.920
...ex... is...

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
...next?

01:20.280 --> 01:23.040
I did not think
that I was gonna feel like this.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074

01:39.040 --> 01:40.200
I did get with Scott.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.040
I had a shit time with Jemma.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.360
Yous two have fucked each other.
I fucked Gaz once.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.240
Hopefully what comes out the water
is just gonna make it better for me.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.600
I'm coming back in for my ex, Bear.
How are you?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.080
She means fuck all to me.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.760
Nice to meet you. All right?

01:56.840 --> 01:59.400
I know Hawley wants revenge.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.080
I couldn't give a fuck
what happens at the villa.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.440
(shouting)

02:05.960 --> 02:07.960
I fancy you, too.
(laughs)

02:10.600 --> 02:12.760
I'd like to do you up the bum.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.600
(laughs)

02:14.680 --> 02:15.920
Oh, lovely.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.240
The king is back.
Long live the fucking king.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.760
Ashley Cain is my ex.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.000
All us girls have just got
a little bit of a minge twinge.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.600
I'm about to show these pretenders
what it's all about.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.240
Last night I absolutely
fucking smashed it.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.080
I am the first person
that's executed a threesome.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.640
Normal, eh!

02:53.720 --> 02:55.760
The king is back.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.080
(Jemma) Last night,
I had a threesome.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.480
The guy who I'm in love with
is in this villa

03:02.560 --> 03:04.880
getting with another girl
in my face.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.920
I need to take my mind off it.

03:11.120 --> 03:15.960
I've woke up and I feel all happy
and refreshed and vitalised.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.000
Gave her a bit of finger blasting,

03:18.080 --> 03:20.600
and got tugged off at the same time,
happy days.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.120
I like Hawley, he likes me,
so I'm gonna carry on things.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.360
So last night
I finally got a bit of action.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.200
I got wanked off by Charlotte.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.160
Proper felt like I was Spiderman.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.080
Boosh! Boosh! Ah!

03:43.800 --> 03:46.600
It just went all over the red dress
and all over me.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.160
Hopefully tonight...

03:49.320 --> 03:51.120
...have a bit of rumpy pumpy.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.000
Love is in the air
for Bear and Charlotte right now,

03:56.080 --> 03:59.480
but it's what's in the water
they've gotta worry about.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.520
(evil cackle)

04:04.240 --> 04:08.640
The Tablet of Terror has sent
everyone out for a bit of family fun,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.400
to beat the living daylights
out of each other.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.880
It's only Muay Thai!

04:16.959 --> 04:19.680
I love Muay Thai! Whoo!

04:20.680 --> 04:23.160
(Jemma) I'm buzzing
we're doing Muay Thai.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.680
I wanna fight
either Hawley or Holly.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.680
The gang is split into two teams.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.800
Thailand Swingers...
and Team Piss Head.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.760
Team Piss Head!
Go on!

04:35.840 --> 04:39.600
My first pair's gonna be
Liam and Bear.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.320
Come on, Bear!

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
Oi, oi!

04:44.080 --> 04:47.400
Ooh, ah, ooh. What the fuck?

04:47.480 --> 04:50.560
Liam is a really sweet guy,
but he is so annoying.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.600
(instructor) Oi! Oi, in the ring,
in the ring, in the ring!

04:54.680 --> 04:57.960
Block, that's countering.
Bring your knee up and block.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.040
Easy!

04:59.120 --> 05:02.440
There's only one person
I want to match up with, Gaz.Fuck.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.080
Come on, Gaz!

05:04.160 --> 05:06.840
Come on, Hawley.
He's fucked your bird!

05:08.360 --> 05:10.080
(instructor) Well done. Good.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.640
Fucking come on, kid.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.880
I fucked it.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.400
Kiss and make up, yeah.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.280
Kayleigh versus Jordan,
battle of the bitches.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.680
The only chance you've got
of getting Kayleigh on her back.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.280
I can't fight a girl.
I'll fucking kill her.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.720
(shouting)

05:42.520 --> 05:45.360
(cheering)

05:45.440 --> 05:47.160
(Jordan) Tactical move for me.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.160
Let her win so then she thinks
Jordan's a nice guy,

05:50.240 --> 05:52.000
and then yeah, bang her tonight.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.120
(narrator) Good luck with that.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.480
Holly,
you're gonna be fighting Jemma.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.000
Get in, you little bitch.
You're gonna get a fucking punch.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.960
All right. Nice and tight.

06:02.040 --> 06:06.320
It's like fucking Goliath and
the little man, going at each other.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.240
(squeals)

06:17.560 --> 06:20.880
I did aim for her tits, I didn't
mean to get her in the face.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.040
Knockout! Sorry, bitch.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.160
Please, no more!

06:37.000 --> 06:39.720
I think we'll end this one early,
a bit of a mismatch.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.680
(sobbing)
Oh, Holly! Holly!

06:45.280 --> 06:46.920
Time out, breathe.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.480
Are you all right?
No.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.600
Hawley comes over to console me

06:52.680 --> 06:56.560
and all I can feel is Jemma's beady
eyes burning the back of my head.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.640
I didn't mean to punch her
in the face.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.800
Do you want water?

07:02.680 --> 07:05.880
Hawley's comforting Holly,
what the fuck are you doing?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.480
If that was me, he wouldn't.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.720
Wipe your tears away. Come here.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.080
There you go.
Thank you.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.840
You might've won the battle, hon,
but you ain't fucking won the war.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.720
It's fighting talk now,

07:19.800 --> 07:23.560
but will new battle lines be drawn
when the next ex arrives?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.720
T minus 20 hours.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.720
Whose ex is next?

07:33.640 --> 07:36.760
Back at the villa,
Gaz has had a revelation.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.280
His ex may be on her way.
Oh, you think so?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.560
Last night it kind of really sank in

07:43.640 --> 07:46.920
that the one ex I'm getting
nervous about is Lillie.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.760
Gaz, please welcome the new arrival

07:50.840 --> 07:53.520
by sounding the gong.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.320
My hands are shaking,
I can't feel me legs.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.200
(shouting)
Ready?!

07:58.280 --> 08:00.000
(gong sounds)

08:00.080 --> 08:03.000
I think she deserves an explanation
of what went on.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.520
I'm ready for it now, I think. Just.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.840
I say that now, if I'm at the beach
I'll be like that. (panting)

08:08.920 --> 08:11.880
Me and Lillie, there's so much
emotion and history.

08:11.960 --> 08:15.000
I couldn't imagine her
walking out the water.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.640
The thing is, Charlotte's your ex,
she came in,

08:17.720 --> 08:20.960
but there was no issues there
cos it wasn't a proper ex.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.520
One-night stand.
Exactly.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
Lillie was a major part
of your life.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.960
I feel sorry for him
but at the end of the day,

08:27.040 --> 08:30.240
it's fucking Ex On The Beach,
so, Gaz, dry your tears.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.360
It's gonna happen.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.679
Enough of me anyway,
I've got my issues.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.559
(laughs)But like, mate,
you must be screwing, man.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.640
In terms of the lasses,
there's not many options.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.000
None of them are smoking hot,
none of them are above a six,

08:45.080 --> 08:48.400
so I'm hoping some fucking
fresh meat's gonna come in soon.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.800
To be honest though, mate,
I'm getting a little bit worried.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.040
Series one, I didn't have
much luck with the birds.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.960
Did you not?
No, mate. No.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.400
I didn't have an ex but I didn't
have any luck with the lasses.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.920
I'm hoping it's not gonna be
the fucking same.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.600
Get up there.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.000
To a happy villa.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.640
What better than to do a game?

09:16.720 --> 09:17.880
I love games!

09:17.960 --> 09:20.040
It's called Truth or Bear.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.600
Charlotte?
Yes?

09:21.680 --> 09:25.200
Does Bear have a big penis?

09:25.280 --> 09:28.520
I think I'm gonna have to have
another look tonight.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.920
Oh!

09:31.080 --> 09:33.320
Get up there, my son!

09:33.400 --> 09:34.960
I've got a good one.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.360
Bear, do you like Charlotte,
or are you using her for a fuck?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.680
That's easy,
I really fancy Charlotte.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.880
How can you say no?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.680
(giggles)

09:44.760 --> 09:47.920
Jem, do you still love Hawley?
Yes.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.360
I can't believe it,
Jemma says she still loves Hawley

09:53.440 --> 09:55.480
and I'm sat in the fucking middle.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.080
Do you still love Jemma?
No.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.680
That's a lie.
He's lying!

09:59.760 --> 10:01.680
Who thinks he's lying?

10:02.760 --> 10:04.680
But seriously, I fucking don't.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.400
You told me two days ago you did.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.360
Did you?
No.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.000
Oh, you're winding me up!

10:11.080 --> 10:13.880
He still loves me. I know he does.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.480
Hawley, you are full of shit.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.320
Holly is a pawn in his game.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.480
Get your trampy little hand
off my head, you patronising skank.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.640
Like go fucking speak to her.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.680
I don't want to listen to it.
Do you know what I mean?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.520
Do you really fancy Holly?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.480
I know you don't.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.000
I think Jemma's just trying
to cock block me.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.360
Bitch, move out the way,
Hawley's mine.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.920
Situation's pathetic.
She's going on like an idiot.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Every single person inside of here
thinks you're an idiot.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.080
Hawley is winding me up.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.960
Like fucking who, Hawley?

10:53.240 --> 10:55.200
Fuck you, Hawley.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.240
With everyone bedding down
for the night...

11:05.200 --> 11:07.520
...some people are getting lucky.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.640
While others definitely aren't.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.520
They may be sleeping soundly now,
but they'll be woken up with a bang

11:32.600 --> 11:35.880
when the next human hand grenade
is lobbed into the villa.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.000
T minus seven hours.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.320
I'm feeling very excited about Bear.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.240
We're always laughing,
we're always smiling.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.760
I think we are
just perfect together.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.480
How was last night?

12:01.560 --> 12:05.200
You give the best head ever. Ever.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.720
We're getting on,
so now what I'm thinking is,

12:07.800 --> 12:11.320
have a threesome with her girl
mates. I always want more.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
Greedy Bear.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.200
Greedy Bear.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.880
I really like Gary.
The more time I'm spending with him,

12:19.960 --> 12:22.280
the more I'm starting to like him.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.560
But I feel like I have
a bit of a guard up.

12:24.640 --> 12:29.120
His ex could come in any day
and I don't wanna get hurt.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.360
Where did you sleep, Hawley?

12:34.440 --> 12:36.080
With Holly?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.320
Did you bang, Hawley?

12:39.400 --> 12:43.440
Holly definitely had a sick time
with me. From what I'd done,

12:43.520 --> 12:45.720
she was laid there
like a shot giraffe.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.800
What was it, a couple of pumps
and stopped, or was it like...

13:01.640 --> 13:03.880
Obviously I had a good time
last night,

13:03.960 --> 13:06.360
but the first thing I think
when I wake up is,

13:06.440 --> 13:09.240
"Fuck, I'm gonna have to
go and speak to Jemma."

13:09.320 --> 13:11.160
I'm literally so nervous.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.480
I don't know
how she's going to react.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.200
So I just am telling you
cos I've just woke up

13:18.280 --> 13:20.840
and I don't want you to hear it
from anyone else.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.480
I've already heard it.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.200
Yep.
OK.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.960
I can't keep any fucking secrets
in this villa.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.320
So why did you do it?

13:30.400 --> 13:34.520
At the time I was drunk. I'm not
using that as an excuse at all,

13:34.600 --> 13:37.960
because if I didn't want to,
I wouldn't have.Don't say it then.

13:38.040 --> 13:41.000
I just think that you don't really
have a leg to stand on

13:41.080 --> 13:43.560
because you've shagged Gaz
and Ashley.

13:43.640 --> 13:47.400
Holly's using the fact that I've got
with other people in this villa

13:47.480 --> 13:49.560
as an excuse as to why
she shagged my ex.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.440
That doesn't make it all right.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.240
I still think he's trying
to use you to piss me off.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.520
If you don't think that,
that's fine, I'm not bothered.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.280
I'm actually so drained
from this situation.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.400
I can't be friends with someone
who does that.

14:03.480 --> 14:07.040
Holly's telling me this because
she wants to fucking clear the air.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.240
Sorry, babe, the air ain't clear.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.720
(tablet dings)

14:17.800 --> 14:19.520
(all groaning)

14:19.600 --> 14:21.520
I don't believe this.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.600
Tablet of terror, you fucking knob.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.520
"No rest for the wicked."

14:28.600 --> 14:31.360
"It's beach time for the boys."

14:31.440 --> 14:33.680
"Jordan, Bear and Gaz, get ready,

14:33.760 --> 14:36.160
it's time to greet
your new arrivals."

14:36.240 --> 14:38.400
(Bear) What!
Oh, shit!

14:38.480 --> 14:42.000
Three boys going down to the beach?
I think it's a girl.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.160
I'm literally, like, bricking it.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.400
To be fair, like, my ex bird is fit.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.120
Fingers, toes, tits, bunions crossed
it's not her.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.520
Mine is mental.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.280
Megan's got a boyfriend,
and this is a dating show.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.760
So if she's back it's for one reason
and that's to get back at me.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.280
Come on, boys!

15:02.360 --> 15:04.160
Let's go get ready then!

15:04.240 --> 15:06.280
(humming)

15:06.360 --> 15:08.760
Gaz, Jordan and Bear
have gone to the beach,

15:08.840 --> 15:12.080
so hopefully that means one thing.
Some new girls are coming.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.200
(narrator) So they can ignore you,
too, Liam? Nice.

15:16.400 --> 15:19.720
You may be excited by a new arrival
in the villa now, Liam,

15:19.800 --> 15:24.920
but not everyone will be smiling
when the next ex washes in.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.640
(evil cackle)

15:35.160 --> 15:36.360
(Bear) I'm so nervous.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.160
Out of all three who are here,

15:38.240 --> 15:42.360
we've got one ex that is fucking
scary, you know what I mean?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.120
Hopefully it's not Georgia,
cos I still love her.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.160
I can't stand someone kissing her.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.720
I didn't think I'll care, but nah.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.040
Throw me in here, Georgia comes out,
I'm fucked.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.680
How you gonna react
if Lillie comes round, Gaz?

15:56.760 --> 15:58.160
Depends on her reaction.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.080
If she shouts
I'll probably just let her shout.

16:01.160 --> 16:05.520
When it's someone you've got
a history with, it's a lot harder.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.280
Over the last five years,
I've had one serious girlfriend.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.840
If it's her,
this isn't a girl I've just banged,

16:11.920 --> 16:14.400
this is a girl
I was looking for houses with,

16:14.480 --> 16:17.440
there when my nephew was born.
This is real life shit.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.600
Let's get it done.You're
that nervous you won't shut up.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.280
This is not gonna go well
if Megan comes into the villa.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.440
Oh, fuck me.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.320
I love a fucking day on the beach

16:29.400 --> 16:33.200
but this time round, I've got
genuine feelings at stake here.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.720
Oh, I can't believe it.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.200
The Tablet of Terror
is on team Holly-Hawley

16:43.280 --> 16:45.520
and has sent them on a date.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.880
I might be shit scared of heights
and the sea,

16:50.960 --> 16:53.600
but it's gonna be all right
because I'm with Hawley

16:53.680 --> 16:55.640
and he looks like a worldy.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.760
(shrieks)

16:57.840 --> 16:59.360
Oh, my God! I don't like it!

16:59.440 --> 17:00.760
(laughs)

17:00.840 --> 17:02.440
Oh, my God!

17:03.400 --> 17:05.680
I think I could sit on this
all day long.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.800
This position I'm in is making us
think about being behind Holly.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.680
Oh, lucky lady.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.640
Whoo!
Dip, dip, dip!

17:13.720 --> 17:16.200
(shrieks)
My fucking balls are wet.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.880
And touch down.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.520
Best day ever,

17:19.599 --> 17:22.440
only cos you were with me, though.
Yeah, good.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.800
So I finally get a chance
with Hawley

17:24.880 --> 17:27.319
to ask him actually
how he does feel about me.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.800
If there was anyone I would've
chosen for this, it'd be you.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.880
Good.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.400
I felt that he might
be using me a little bit

17:34.480 --> 17:37.200
but the way he's been today,
he's reassured me.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.280
I don't think he's using me one bit.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.200
Obviously, we'll just play it cool
with each other.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.000
But at this moment in time,
of course I like ya.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.080
It's good to get away from Jemma,
Holly's looking fine.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.560
I don't want this to end.

17:49.640 --> 17:53.560
Do you think you definitely
not gonna get back with Jemma?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.920
You don't want to?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.440
No chance that will ever happen.
So you're not gonna mug me off?

17:58.520 --> 18:00.680
Definitely not with Jemma, no.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.400
No, I was joking, man.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.880
I just dropped one there.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.640
I'm not that type of lad.
I've had it done to me royally.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.080
So I'm not gonna mug someone else
off when I've had it done to me.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.280
It's not a good fucking feeling,
like.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.240
OK. Well, wanna give me a kiss then?

18:19.320 --> 18:20.760
Yeah, come here.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.800
(groans)

18:31.080 --> 18:33.400
You're that nervous you're quiet!
I know!

18:33.480 --> 18:34.840
Never seen you so quiet.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.840
Oh, man!

18:40.880 --> 18:42.200
Fucking hell.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.080
It's all getting a bit real now.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.520
Fuck me.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.520
Oh, fucking hell.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.800
I'm Lillie.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.520
I'm a fashion designer.

19:24.600 --> 19:28.160
Some people might know me
as Gary Beadle's ex-girlfriend.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.440
We had a wicked relationship.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.960
Gary was my best friend.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.480
And he definitely has been
the love of my life.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.600
I did think he was the one
that I would be with forever.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.720
He just broke up with me,
totally out of the blue,

19:41.800 --> 19:43.840
and we haven't really spoke since.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.320
I definitely think
I need some answers.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.400
OK? (sighs)

19:52.400 --> 19:53.840
You OK?
Yeah, you?

19:53.920 --> 19:56.880
This is Bear and Jordan.
Nice to meet you.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.640
This is weird, man.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.640
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.280
She's smoking!

20:06.040 --> 20:08.400
Who's this, Gaz?
This is Lillie.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.520
I was with her for a year-and-half.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.120
She's the nicest person
you'll ever meet.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.200
(clears throat)

20:16.280 --> 20:18.520
I know Gary very well.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.720
And I know
he's seriously uncomfortable.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.680
Am I gonna have any nasty surprises?

20:24.760 --> 20:27.000
I don't think so.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.880
It's... This is weird for me, man.

20:30.960 --> 20:35.080
Like I say... Like sitting here,
like looking at you.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.640
I haven't seen her in person
since the day we finished,

20:38.720 --> 20:41.840
so her sitting next to me
does not feel real.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.360
We need to talk about
a few things you've done

20:44.440 --> 20:47.720
because I think you've been
really disrespectful towards me.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.040
But not because
I want to get back with you,

20:50.120 --> 20:53.240
or because of anything other
than I think you owe me that.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.880
You owe me an explanation.
(clears throat)

20:55.960 --> 20:58.560
I can tell in his eyes
he knows he's in the wrong

20:58.640 --> 21:01.560
and that he's got
a lot of apologising to do.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.800
When was the last time
you seen each other?

21:04.880 --> 21:06.200
When he split up with me.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.920
Literally, five...
Two minutes at the airport.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.200
Before that we spent every day
together for a year and a half.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.000
If you like her so much, why
did you let her go? She's gorgeous.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.720
I know, but... (sighs)
Thanks.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.640
So what's your type of boy then?
What do you go for?

21:21.720 --> 21:25.160
Tanned, normally blue eyes,
nice teeth.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.120
Bear, tick, tick, tick.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.040
Ticks all the boxes. I'm excited.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.320
(tablet dings)

21:33.400 --> 21:34.640
(all groan)

21:34.720 --> 21:36.360
Here we are.
You are joking.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.440
Why?

21:38.520 --> 21:40.600
"Welcome to the beach, Lillie."

21:40.680 --> 21:42.600
"You're off on a date with Bear."

21:42.680 --> 21:45.640
"It's a chance to loosen up
and let it all go."

21:47.400 --> 21:48.800
Do you like getting loose?

21:50.280 --> 21:51.640
I'm a lady.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.720
And I'm a gentleman.
OK, that should work then.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.520
Bear's hot. Bear's a sort.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.320
Are you excited
we're going on a date?

22:00.400 --> 22:01.600
Yeah.
Yeah?

22:01.680 --> 22:03.040
Gaz is fuming about it.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.680
He's trying to stay strong
and hide it

22:05.760 --> 22:09.040
but his emotions are all out there
for everyone to see.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.840
Go on, then.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.840
Let's go.
Go on, Bear. Off you go.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.960
Gonna be the best night
of your life.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.920
OK.
Come on, then.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.400
Seeing her walk off
holding someone's hand is fucked up.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.920
I don't know how I feel.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.920
This looks really nice.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.040
(narrator) 'Bear and Lillie
have been sent on a reiki date

22:37.120 --> 22:39.360
to address
their spiritual wellbeing.'

22:40.680 --> 22:42.800
I want to bring you back
into balance.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.200
I want to clean you up
energetically.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.760
Apparently, it's reiki.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.800
Nutty.

22:51.240 --> 22:54.800
Is there anything specific
you would like to work on?

22:54.880 --> 22:58.360
Working things out
with my ex-boyfriend

22:58.440 --> 23:00.320
so then we can just be friends.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.440
OK.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.320
When you see him,
you wanna be in your centre, OK?

23:05.400 --> 23:08.640
Part of you that's off
is your emotional and astral body.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.880
Is she all right?

23:11.680 --> 23:14.040
I wanna go into outer energy bodies.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.400
So if you can see,
it just starts to pick energy up.

23:20.760 --> 23:25.760
This lady is flinging this
pendulum stone thing over my face.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.200
She's like, "Can you see
the movement? It's going crazy."

23:29.280 --> 23:32.800
I'm thinking, "Because your fingers
are making it go crazy."

23:32.880 --> 23:36.320
Has it detected if she fancies me
yet or not?(laughs)

23:37.360 --> 23:39.840
You'll just have to let
the pendant tell you.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.760
(laughs)

23:41.840 --> 23:43.600
I know Lillie likes me.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.160
I can sense it.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.440
(narrator) Yes, Bear. Must be
those special psychic powers.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.480
Back at the villa, they're trying
to work out what happened.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.120
Do you reckon the boys are gonna
come back as friends or enemies?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.760
Keep your enemies closer, eh?

24:01.840 --> 24:03.400
If Bear's on that...
Oh!

24:03.480 --> 24:07.280
Oh. here we go, here we go.
We knew it'd be Bear.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.960
Is it what we expected?

24:10.040 --> 24:11.680
It's Lillie, man. Lillie.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.800
Fuck.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.360
Lillie came in,
Bear's gone on a date.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.240
It was just...
It was so weird like...

24:22.320 --> 24:24.800
Cos I haven't seen her
since the day we split up.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.320
Was she excited? Nervous?

24:26.400 --> 24:28.160
Nervous as fuck. She was shaking.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.120
But, like...
Bless her.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.920
Bear and Lillie on a date,
Bear is gonna try it.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.880
I've never ever seen Gaz so quiet.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.440
It was fucking weird.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.800
Cos I know how she feels about you.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.080
You went through so much
with someone...

24:44.160 --> 24:47.080
And, like... I don't know.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.520
I can't tell you.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.720
We knew this was Ex On The Beach
and that an ex is gonna come

24:51.800 --> 24:54.600
and they have massive
unfinished business.

24:54.680 --> 24:56.160
So weird.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.400
Me and him could carry on,
but I don't wanna be second best.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.520
You're acting very weird.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.440
Mate, you're looking like
someone's put a syringe in you

25:05.520 --> 25:06.840
and sucked your soul out.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.480
It was hard to watch.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.080
I'll be very quiet,
you'll notice that.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.840
My head's gone.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.520
Gaz comes back from the beach

25:14.600 --> 25:17.800
and announces that his ex, Lillie,
has arrived.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.040
All I can think is
"For fuck's sake."

25:21.120 --> 25:23.400
"I shagged him on the first night."

25:23.480 --> 25:25.120
It's gonna go off!

25:27.320 --> 25:29.400
He's gonna fucking go for it.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.160
Anyone in here,
if they were attracted to her,

25:32.240 --> 25:35.640
anyone would've gone for it.
Bear's definitely gonna go for it.

25:35.720 --> 25:39.840
Tonight has got the potential to be
fucking the most explosive night.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.360
Either way,
I'm looking forward to it.

25:42.440 --> 25:46.240
A fresh face in the house has got
the potential to go upside down.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.680
Standard night here, mate, lovely.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.400
You may be excited by
the new arrival now,

25:52.480 --> 25:57.760
but will it be fun and games when
the evening's entertainment begins?

25:57.840 --> 26:00.240
Whose ex is next?

26:02.200 --> 26:04.200
As the villa await the new arrival,

26:04.280 --> 26:07.080
back on the date,
it's time to share some gossip.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.440
Over to you, Bear.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.640
Do you wanna know what's been going
on in the villa? Any questions?

26:13.720 --> 26:16.680
Yes, like,
whose been getting with who?

26:16.760 --> 26:18.720
Who do you wanna know first?
You?

26:18.800 --> 26:21.800
There's a girl called Charlotte.
Nice girl.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.440
But not my type. We've kissed.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.280
Erm...
Just kissed?

26:28.640 --> 26:31.040
She sucked me off last night.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.680
No other way I can put it.
I'm sorry.(coughs)

26:33.760 --> 26:37.400
That is what happened.
Yeah, OK. That's lovely.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.880
Lillie is fit.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.320
I just wanna... (growls)

26:43.400 --> 26:45.040
(laughs)

26:45.120 --> 26:47.800
Dunno what I'm gonna do
about Charlotte.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.520
Would you like to know
who Gaz has been with?Yeah.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.680
Basically, what has Gaz done?

26:52.760 --> 26:56.800
Me and Gaz are mates.
It's a tough situation to be in.

26:56.880 --> 27:00.360
First night, he, erm...
shagged Jemma.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.400
Jemma Lucy.
Wow.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.480
Gonna play this one very smooth.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.360
That's a massive shock.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.040
Did he really?
He did, babe.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.840
I can't believe that.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.360
Do you know her?
Yeah.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.600
Is she your friend?
Yeah.Oh.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.560
Massively shocked
that she's done that, massively.

27:22.640 --> 27:26.880
And I know that if I got
with Hawley, she'd be devastated.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.240
Really?
But...

27:29.080 --> 27:30.080
Glad I know.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.600
When I get back to the villa,

27:31.680 --> 27:34.720
I'm looking forward
to seeing how Jemma is with me.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.360
I didn't think she had that in her.
I didn't think she'd do that.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.840
Jemma's clearly not the friend
I thought she was.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.560
With Lillie having received
some bad news,

27:47.640 --> 27:51.160
back at the villa,
everyone's being nice to each other.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.640
Olivia's got nice nail varnish on.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.840
I wonder how long that will last.

27:57.920 --> 28:02.440
Kayleigh, you've got a banging body,
it turns me on.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.440
Thanks. (laughs)

28:04.520 --> 28:07.600
Jemma, I like the fact
that you're an absolute filth bag.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.680
(laughs)
(whoops)

28:12.640 --> 28:14.720
Don't think it'll be very long.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.240
(tablet dings)

28:16.880 --> 28:17.880
(all groan)

28:18.760 --> 28:21.360
(Ashley) What the fuck?

28:21.440 --> 28:23.400
Oh, my God.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.040
"Olivia."

28:25.120 --> 28:28.200
"The villa is filling up
and someone needs to go home."

28:29.240 --> 28:32.400
"Liam or Ashley,
the choice is yours."

28:32.480 --> 28:36.200
I'm in shock, my legs are shaking,
I feel sick.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.040
Are you joking?

28:38.120 --> 28:39.640
No.
What the fuck?

28:43.160 --> 28:45.000
Stitched right up.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.760
I'm so sorry, Liam.
I'm gonna have to say you.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.400
OK, no bother.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.520
She was always gonna
fucking pick me.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.440
So I know my fate was there.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.720
What the fuck?

28:58.800 --> 28:59.920
Phew.

29:03.080 --> 29:06.200
The decision was crazy.
He got on with the guys

29:06.280 --> 29:09.360
and he fucking did
a million sit ups every day,

29:09.440 --> 29:11.560
but that's all
he brought to the table.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.880
I'm going in as a new Liam.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.480
I'm looking for the four Fs.

29:20.560 --> 29:24.080
Fit, fun, flirty
and fucking massive tits.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.960
Olivia is game. She's getting
fucking banged tonight.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.800
Liam is so irritating.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.080
I'm not interested in you
and that is it.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.640
I'll call it a day with Olivia.
Getting...

29:36.720 --> 29:39.880
Not getting nowhere.
Liam is more annoying than thrush.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.960
Anything you do, a fucking goblin.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.680
Absolutely gutted,
I'm sick as a cunt.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.920
(narrator) Liam's departure
means only one thing,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.080
more room for more exes.

29:55.160 --> 29:59.000
Lucky for them, another one's
already on their way.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.720
Whose ex is next?

30:03.640 --> 30:06.400
With the imminent arrival
of Gaz's ex, Lillie,

30:06.480 --> 30:08.120
the villa is tense.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.080
Just how the Tablet of Terror
likes it.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.760
(screaming)

30:19.760 --> 30:22.160
Hello!

30:23.240 --> 30:26.000
I swiftly look over at Gaz

30:26.080 --> 30:30.080
and his head is just
literally buried to the ground.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.440
Oh, I can't do this, me like.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.280
What did you do? What did you do?
Lillie will tell ya.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.560
It was really pretty. You had to
walk through these gardens.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.480
There was little candles.
You had to lie down.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.560
I'm thinking,
"What does Lillie know?"

30:47.640 --> 30:51.960
Does she know I've got with Gaz?
Does she know what he's been doing?

30:52.040 --> 30:56.560
They asked us what was a negative
thing in our body, didn't they?

30:56.640 --> 30:59.720
(Kayleigh) What did you say?
I've got to live with my ex

30:59.800 --> 31:03.480
and I'd like it to, like,
just be friendly and amicable.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.360
'Gary can't even look at me.'

31:05.440 --> 31:09.360
The whole time I was talking,
he was just standing there like this.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.400
Bear, who do you like more,
Charlotte or Lillie?

31:12.480 --> 31:13.560
For God's sake.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.200
Little shitbag.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.760
I'll be honest,
I've had a good time so far.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.960
I don't wanna single one person out.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.040
It takes me a while to get to know
a lot of people here.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.120
Answer the fucking question.
I don't need to answer.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.680
(all talking)

31:27.760 --> 31:29.240
Who?
Charlotte or Lillie?

31:29.320 --> 31:32.200
I haven't gotta choose anything.
I've been pied.

31:32.280 --> 31:36.400
I didn't expect him just not even
knowing who to fucking choose.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.600
Like,
it should be fucking obvious, pal.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.400
Fine, that's fine, at least I know.
That's fine.

31:46.520 --> 31:50.560
I have no idea if Lillie knows
about me and Gaz

31:50.640 --> 31:52.600
but I wanna be the first to tell her.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.440
The thing is...
Just tell me what's happened.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.720
Just promise me we can chat
and you're not gonna storm off.

31:58.800 --> 31:59.920
I promise you.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.720
(groans) I hate myself.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.440
The Tablet of Terror goes off,

32:04.520 --> 32:07.160
you have to pick someone
to take to the penthouse.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.440
So I picked Gaz,
we went to the penthouse.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.800
Alcohol got involved
and I did get with Gaz.

32:11.880 --> 32:15.240
When you say "get," like kissed?

32:15.320 --> 32:16.600
I slept with Gaz.

32:19.240 --> 32:23.080
Everybody gets drunk, doesn't mean
you sleep with your friend's ex.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.560
It just happened.
I appreciate you telling me.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.240
Because it says
you've got to go to a penthouse,

32:29.320 --> 32:31.600
it doesn't mean you have to sleep
with them.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.840
She was my friend.
Didn't expect that at all.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.360
I see Jemma cracking on
with Lillie.

32:38.440 --> 32:42.400
I wanna tell her what Jemma's like,
and let Lillie know who I am.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.840
I've heard a lot about you.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.520
You do realise he shagged Jemma.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.520
Yeah, she's just telling me.

32:51.240 --> 32:54.560
Hawley told me he's not bothered
about the Jemma situation,

32:54.640 --> 32:58.120
and I turn around and him and Jemma
are talking about it again.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.680
This is a very nasty situation
to come into.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.840
I'm upset I've had to have this
on my first night

33:03.920 --> 33:07.520
because I just wanna have a nice
time.What the fuck's going on?

33:07.600 --> 33:10.280
Obviously you two have got a past...

33:10.360 --> 33:13.040
Why are you over here?
Why are you so bothered?

33:13.120 --> 33:15.920
He's told her that I've been
through every person.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.640
I actually started to believe
that Hawley liked me

33:19.720 --> 33:22.480
and then he just fucking
goes at Jemma again.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.920
He's so bothered.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.600
Why are you still here?
Why are you so bothered?

33:26.680 --> 33:29.720
Because I need to make sure
that she's OK coming in.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.520
Yeah, but why have you...
(indistinct)

33:33.600 --> 33:34.880
Why are you bothered?

33:34.960 --> 33:38.840
I am bothered because the way...
You're making me look like an idiot.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.960
He says he's not bothered
about Jemma but he clearly is.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.200
Why do you keep bringing things up

33:44.280 --> 33:46.840
that are gonna make you
argue with her?

33:46.920 --> 33:50.400
I've already fallen out with Jemma,
OK?

33:50.480 --> 33:53.760
She's supposed to be my mate.
It's got nothing to do with you.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.080
Hawley! Hawley!

33:55.160 --> 33:57.440
Come here with the boys.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.320
Fuck me, don't come in on me.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.600
No, no, why are you shouting at me?
Don't shout at me.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.360
Why are you two arguing?

34:05.440 --> 34:08.520
Why are you shouting at me?
You don't need to go on at me.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.320
(both arguing)

34:10.400 --> 34:13.760
I'm so chilled.
Why are you shouting at me?

34:13.840 --> 34:17.679
Why are you explaining yourself to
Jemma? Don't fucking laugh at me.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.600
Chill out.
Fuck off.

34:20.679 --> 34:25.159
Fuck off.
I can't be arsed with your agg.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.800
You make me look like
a fucking idiot.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.719
Now Jemma thinks that she's won.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.719
She said to me, "He's using me,
he doesn't care."

34:33.800 --> 34:35.960
"He doesn't like you, la, la, la."

34:36.040 --> 34:39.560
And now... No, wait!
Cos now I look like a fucking idiot.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.400
Because it looks like it's true.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.400
I fucking told you, babe, from
day one. You didn't fucking listen.

34:45.480 --> 34:48.000
Well, deal with it now, bitch.
Seriously.

34:48.080 --> 34:51.440
No, it's not funny! It's not funny!
Calm down.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.920
Holly, you're a nutter!

34:53.000 --> 34:56.199
Honestly, don't fucking laugh at me!

34:56.280 --> 34:57.760
Every fucking time...

34:57.840 --> 34:59.800
(screams)

34:59.880 --> 35:01.400
Why are you laughing?!

35:01.480 --> 35:05.240
Well, she's kind of shown
her true colours, hasn't she?

35:05.320 --> 35:07.440
Get away from me. Get away from me!

35:08.720 --> 35:10.360
Fucking mental.

35:14.640 --> 35:17.320
I don't like bunny boilers
or swillers.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.960
You're a cunt!

35:20.040 --> 35:21.320
Off you pop.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.800
Fucking hate everyone!

35:27.080 --> 35:28.880
While Holly calms herself down,

35:28.960 --> 35:31.320
Lillie's sharing
her side of the story.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.760
The one reason I've come out here

35:35.840 --> 35:39.640
is because I have constant
nastiness, like, thrown my way.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.560
Everybody knows my name
and my face because of Gary,

35:42.640 --> 35:45.920
but nobody knows me. I feel like
I had no choice to do this.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.440
I need to get my say.
I need people to see me for me.

35:49.520 --> 35:53.280
I need people to realise,
this girl fell in love with a boy,

35:53.360 --> 35:55.600
they had a break up,
the whole world knew,

35:55.680 --> 35:59.840
and she's walked away with it.
Why give her a hard time?Yeah.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.640
Just let me...
I just wanna get on with my life.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.440
I'm telling them my side.

36:04.520 --> 36:08.080
And they're choked and upset
cos I think they feel bad.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.360
They realise what I've gone through.

36:10.440 --> 36:15.040
I've never ever in my entire life
loved anybody the way I loved him.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.280
I see him upset
and that does upset me.

36:17.360 --> 36:21.080
But I'm thinking, "You're upset now?
Five months down the line?"

36:21.160 --> 36:25.160
What about the last five months that
I've had to deal with your actions?

36:25.240 --> 36:27.240
It's not like a normal relationship

36:27.320 --> 36:29.840
where someone sleeps
with someone else.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.920
Look what he's done for five months
to me and I've not reacted.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.600
I've just had to deal with it.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.480
And, oh,
now you're faced with me it's hard?

36:45.320 --> 36:47.400
I don't know how
she fucking does it.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.880
It's just such
a fucked up situation.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.720
That was the person
I wanted to marry.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.720
I've never ever had the feelings
I had for him, I worshipped him.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.240
I do feel really awkward.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.320
I don't know how I'm gonna be
around her or around Gary.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.280
I've been in his bed. Kissing.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.240
I feel like she deserves to know.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.320
We split up. I've not text him,
not tweeted about him,

37:08.400 --> 37:10.040
not sold a story about him.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.720
It's not that I'm weak, people
take my kindness for weakness.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.840
I feel really lucky to be in the
villa with the girls that I've met.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.800
They seem really lovely.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.920
Hopefully we're gonna build
some nice friendships.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.360
(narrator) Wishful thinking, Lillie.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.840
Bear's still only got
one thing on his mind.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.360
Bear doesn't give a fuck
about anyone but himself.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.160
Just wants to get his end away.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.360
I've been mugged off
and it's just embarrassing.

38:09.440 --> 38:13.960
I wasn't even trying to have
a relationship with Bear at all.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.400
I just really got on with him.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.160
I genuinely thought,
like, he liked you.

38:19.240 --> 38:22.320
Yeah, but it's bullshit.
I should've fucking listened.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.040
Tonight has been
really, really tense.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.320
Bear is one fucked up individual.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.560
(indistinct)

38:35.640 --> 38:39.480
Stop getting stressed about it.
Stop thinking about it, honestly.

38:39.560 --> 38:43.440
Just seeing your friend get upset,
it's fucking horrible.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.400
I don't know what's going on.

38:45.480 --> 38:49.480
Everyone loves you, honestly.
You're amazing.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.080
Don't let Bear
make you feel like a cunt.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.240
I just don't...
Look, look, look...

38:54.320 --> 38:56.360
She won't look like a slag.
No, no.

38:56.440 --> 39:00.200
She's been with one guy that
she genuinely had a connection with.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.520
I always try and put on
this brave face,

39:02.600 --> 39:06.040
but I'm just a normal girl
with fucking feelings, to be honest.

39:07.120 --> 39:07.320
