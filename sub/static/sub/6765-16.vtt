00:02.004 --> 00:03.698
Okay, Zuckerman,

00:03.739 --> 00:05.467
how'd you know
l was into Bukowski, huh?

00:05.508 --> 00:06.531
Come on.

00:06.576 --> 00:08.064
The renegade poet of our times?

00:08.109 --> 00:09.076
Please.

00:09.111 --> 00:10.475
''There's a bluebird in my heart

00:10.513 --> 00:11.877
''that wants to get out,

00:11.914 --> 00:15.815
''but l pour whisky on him
and inhale cigarette smoke.

00:15.850 --> 00:18.943
''All the whores and bartenders
and the grocery clerks

00:18.987 --> 00:22.149
never know that he's in there.''

00:22.224 --> 00:24.748
You think his friends ever tried
to put him in a rehab?

00:24.793 --> 00:27.158
Well, if they didn't,
maybe they should have.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.659
l don't know.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.129
Do you really think that he
could write that kind of stuff

00:31.165 --> 00:32.756
if he got rid
of all his demons?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.164
Who knows?

00:34.201 --> 00:35.827
William Blake.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.836
Blake says,

00:37.871 --> 00:39.599
''The road to excess leads

00:39.639 --> 00:41.503
right to the gates
of the palace of wisdom.''

00:42.542 --> 00:44.031
Excuse me.

00:51.184 --> 00:52.741
Hi. Uh, Mr. McKay?

00:52.784 --> 00:54.011
Yeah.

00:54.052 --> 00:55.916
l've got some registered
mail here for you.

00:55.954 --> 00:58.888
l'll need you to sign
here, please.

01:01.526 --> 01:02.617
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

01:02.661 --> 01:03.854
Thank you.

01:10.868 --> 01:11.891
What is it?

01:11.936 --> 01:15.837
lt's from Municipal Court.

01:15.873 --> 01:17.897
lt's a notice to appear.

01:17.942 --> 01:19.340
lt's about my accident.

01:19.376 --> 01:20.933
Your accident?

01:20.977 --> 01:24.776
Yeah, l'm being charged:
driving under the influence.

01:24.814 --> 01:26.440
Took 'em long enough.

01:26.483 --> 01:28.677
Yeah, l was beginning to think
it might never come.

01:28.718 --> 01:31.413
Pretty stupid, huh?

01:31.453 --> 01:33.818
Time to face the music.

02:38.949 --> 02:41.610
Hi, this is Donna Martin and
l'm standing here at L.A.'s

02:41.652 --> 02:44.245
hottest new nightclub,
the Peach Pit After Dark.

02:44.288 --> 02:46.778
Oh, and look who just walked in.

02:49.193 --> 02:50.489
lt's the proud owner

02:50.526 --> 02:51.958
and my personal friend,
Nat Bussichio!

02:51.994 --> 02:53.324
Hi.

02:53.363 --> 02:54.454
So, Nat, everything seems

02:54.497 --> 02:55.929
to be coming along very nicely.

02:55.965 --> 02:57.659
When's opening night?

02:57.700 --> 02:58.688
Uh, next Saturday.

02:58.735 --> 03:01.032
Wow, that's one week away.

03:01.070 --> 03:02.434
Excited?

03:02.471 --> 03:04.097
Uh, yeah, excited.

03:04.139 --> 03:06.402
So, l hear you'll be having
live music playing here.

03:06.441 --> 03:07.407
That's right.

03:07.442 --> 03:08.703
So, you know what that means.

03:08.744 --> 03:10.608
All you musicians out there,
send in your tapes.

03:10.645 --> 03:13.545
That could be you,
here, opening night.

03:13.582 --> 03:15.344
-And cut!
-That was great.

03:15.383 --> 03:16.849
Can l go back to worrying now?

03:16.884 --> 03:17.975
Yes, you can.

03:18.018 --> 03:20.349
Why did l ever let you guys
talk me into this?

03:20.388 --> 03:21.786
Look at this place!

03:21.822 --> 03:25.917
You know, l think Ray would
be great here opening night.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.018
Donna, Ray doesn't
even have a band.

03:28.062 --> 03:29.323
He could get one.

03:29.362 --> 03:32.694
His music isn't...
exactly... danceable.

03:32.732 --> 03:33.698
How do you know?

03:33.733 --> 03:35.666
He can do anything.

03:35.702 --> 03:37.828
Haven't we heard
this song before?

03:37.871 --> 03:40.703
Look, tease all you want,
but Ray is good.

03:40.740 --> 03:43.037
And you're going to give him
a chance to prove it.

03:43.075 --> 03:44.598
What do you think?

03:44.643 --> 03:47.611
lt's not worth fighting about.

03:47.646 --> 03:48.737
Donna can be relentless.

03:48.781 --> 03:50.145
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

03:50.249 --> 03:51.146
l'm out of here.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.682
l have an English final
tomorrow morning

03:52.718 --> 03:54.810
and l still don't know who
killed the damn mockingbird.

04:34.989 --> 04:37.582
ltalian, see it?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.956
See it in his eyes.

04:42.697 --> 04:44.596
l wonder if anyone calls.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.427
l mean, his daughter,
his daughter.

04:54.141 --> 04:56.631
All right, folks, easy does it.

04:56.677 --> 04:58.871
This way. Thank you.

05:03.149 --> 05:04.445
Excuse me.

05:07.620 --> 05:10.782
Boy, what some guys
won't do to get out of here.

05:10.823 --> 05:11.789
Excuse me?

05:11.824 --> 05:14.257
That was Corelli.

05:14.292 --> 05:17.021
He dropped dead during dinner...

05:17.062 --> 05:18.892
between the meatballs
and the Jell-O.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.193
-l'm sorry to hear that.
-Oh...

05:25.303 --> 05:26.701
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

05:26.737 --> 05:29.034
-That gentleman over there,
what's his name? -Huh?

05:29.073 --> 05:33.031
Saul Howard.
Famous old actor.

05:33.077 --> 05:34.805
Before your time.

05:38.616 --> 05:39.912
Excuse me, Mr. Howard.

05:39.949 --> 05:42.075
That's right.

05:42.118 --> 05:43.243
My name is Steve Sanders.

05:43.286 --> 05:45.446
You worked with my mother
on a sitcom

05:45.488 --> 05:46.545
called The Hartley House.

05:46.589 --> 05:47.714
Samantha Sanders.

05:47.757 --> 05:50.589
Samantha Sanders is your mother?

05:50.627 --> 05:53.652
Yeah. l used to hang out on
the set when l was a kid.

05:53.695 --> 05:57.130
That's right. Now l remember.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.131
You're Chuckie.

05:59.201 --> 06:01.828
No, no, Chuckie was the name
of the kid on the show.

06:01.870 --> 06:02.858
Oh...

06:02.905 --> 06:04.667
My name is Steve.
l'm the real son.

06:04.706 --> 06:06.070
Oh.

06:06.173 --> 06:09.335
l knew you looked familiar the
second l walked in that door.

06:09.377 --> 06:13.710
68 years in the business
and all anybody ever remembers

06:13.748 --> 06:16.807
is Grandpa Hartley
from some lousy sitcom.

06:16.851 --> 06:20.217
Well, it's good
to see you, Saul.

06:20.253 --> 06:22.618
lt's great to be seen, Chuckie.

06:22.656 --> 06:24.816
l gotta run; l got a meeting
with Mr. Warren.

06:24.858 --> 06:26.017
Mr. Warren?

06:26.059 --> 06:29.926
He's a barrel of laughs.

06:32.498 --> 06:33.623
Come in.

06:37.636 --> 06:38.602
Mr. Warren?

06:38.637 --> 06:40.263
Yeah. What can l do for you?

06:40.306 --> 06:41.397
l'm Steve Sanders.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.964
l'm supposed to see you.

06:44.008 --> 06:45.531
Yeah, is that so?

06:45.577 --> 06:48.170
Yeah. l'm here
about my community service.

06:51.349 --> 06:52.872
Oh, you're the pyromaniac.

06:54.218 --> 06:55.275
Sit down.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.843
l've been waiting to meet you.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.683
Uh, just a second.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.985
l didn't start that fire.

07:01.024 --> 07:03.423
Tell it to the judge.

07:03.460 --> 07:04.448
Well, l did.

07:04.494 --> 07:05.858
And that's why l'm here.

07:05.896 --> 07:09.058
Actually, l was told that
l could just sign something

07:09.099 --> 07:10.690
and that you would
take care of it.

07:10.733 --> 07:13.963
l would take care of it?

07:14.003 --> 07:15.993
That's what l was told.

07:18.975 --> 07:20.202
Don't worry.

07:20.242 --> 07:22.038
The fix is in.

07:23.178 --> 07:25.338
You know,
it never ceases to amaze me

07:25.380 --> 07:26.812
how you rich kids
get your parents

07:26.848 --> 07:29.680
to take care of stuff
like this.

07:29.718 --> 07:31.480
Just tell me where l sign, okay?

07:31.519 --> 07:32.815
-Right here.
-Great.

07:32.854 --> 07:35.014
While you're at it,
why don't you sign them all?

07:35.056 --> 07:37.319
Then l won't have to look
at your smug face again.

07:37.358 --> 07:39.291
What was l supposed
to do here, anyway?

07:39.326 --> 07:42.317
What you're supposed
to do is complete

07:42.363 --> 07:44.796
a hundred hours of service
to the residents in this home.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.732
Clean bedpans, mop floors,
bus meals,

07:47.768 --> 07:50.395
wipe the drool
off of faces of people

07:50.436 --> 07:51.834
who are too old
to help themselves.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.428
Nothing that a nice boy
from Beverly Hills

07:53.473 --> 07:54.461
wants to deal with.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.803
You got that right.

08:08.020 --> 08:12.649
Chuckie, Chuckie, come here.

08:12.691 --> 08:14.351
Get in here. Get in.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.326
Go in.

08:18.095 --> 08:19.925
Here, here.

08:19.964 --> 08:21.396
What is this?

08:21.432 --> 08:23.058
Do me a favor, will ya, Chuckie?

08:23.134 --> 08:25.158
Take this to the laundry for me.

08:25.202 --> 08:26.168
What is it?

08:26.203 --> 08:27.169
My sheets.

08:27.204 --> 08:29.364
l pissed in my bed.

08:31.408 --> 08:33.398
lf they find out,
they'll give me plastic sheets

08:33.443 --> 08:36.070
and make me wear a diaper.

08:36.179 --> 08:38.043
So get it washed, will ya?

08:38.081 --> 08:39.068
And bring it back tonight?

08:39.182 --> 08:40.169
Please do that? Please?

08:41.984 --> 08:43.847
Yeah, sure.

08:49.158 --> 08:50.351
Chuckie...

08:50.392 --> 08:51.415
What?

08:51.460 --> 08:53.450
No starch.

08:58.399 --> 09:00.764
''Discuss the thematic use
of time

09:00.802 --> 09:04.362
as a metaphor in the works
of Thomas Wolfe.''

09:04.405 --> 09:05.666
Why did l take this course?

09:05.707 --> 09:06.798
Tell you what.

09:06.841 --> 09:08.501
l'll take your English final
for you

09:08.542 --> 09:11.237
if you take my economics final
for me.

09:11.278 --> 09:13.245
Yeah, it's a deal.
l know all about money.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.337
There's never enough of it.

09:16.349 --> 09:17.315
Anybody home?

09:17.350 --> 09:19.010
Hey, Val, we're in here.

09:20.386 --> 09:22.910
Hmm, she finally decided
to come home.

09:22.955 --> 09:24.148
Hey, guys.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.554
Happy New Year.

09:25.591 --> 09:27.524
And a Happy New Year
to you, too.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.652
We were expecting you
a couple of days ago.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.060
Yeah, well my first final's
not until tomorrow,

09:32.098 --> 09:34.691
so l decided l'd sneak in
a couple more days.

09:34.733 --> 09:35.699
Hmm.

09:35.734 --> 09:38.065
So, Buffalo was good?

09:38.169 --> 09:41.467
l didn't exactly go to Buffalo.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.064
So, where exactly did you go?

09:45.110 --> 09:46.076
Exactly?

09:46.111 --> 09:48.271
Negril.

09:48.312 --> 09:49.642
Jamaica?

09:49.680 --> 09:52.409
Yeah, it's a lot warmer
than Niagara Falls.

09:52.449 --> 09:54.313
l bought some souvenirs
for everybody.

09:54.351 --> 09:55.681
Well, thank you, but l thought

09:55.719 --> 09:57.185
you were going to see your mom.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.848
l was.

09:59.889 --> 10:01.253
l just couldn't do it.

10:01.290 --> 10:02.688
l couldn't face

10:02.725 --> 10:04.089
going back home.

10:04.127 --> 10:05.252
Not yet.

10:05.294 --> 10:07.488
So l called my mom,
and she understood.

10:07.530 --> 10:09.463
Well, it's good
to have you back.

10:09.499 --> 10:11.125
Yeah, l'm gonna go unpack.

10:14.336 --> 10:16.064
l can't believe her.

10:16.104 --> 10:17.798
She's a compulsive liar.

10:17.839 --> 10:19.362
Kelly, stop the bombing.

10:19.407 --> 10:21.101
Brandon,
l've taken four semesters

10:21.176 --> 10:22.369
of abnormal psychology.

10:22.410 --> 10:23.808
l know what l'm talking about.

10:23.845 --> 10:24.811
She's a textbook case.

10:24.846 --> 10:25.971
l'm sorry, Dr. Taylor.

10:26.013 --> 10:27.912
And when did you get your PhD?

10:27.948 --> 10:30.108
Tell you what.
Why don't you call her mother?

10:30.151 --> 10:31.117
Ask her, hmm?

10:31.185 --> 10:33.209
You know what,
if it'll get you off my back

10:33.254 --> 10:35.278
and off of her case,
l might just do that.

10:35.322 --> 10:36.310
-Good.
-Good.

10:36.357 --> 10:37.687
-Fine.
-Fine.

10:40.627 --> 10:41.786
Saul.

10:41.828 --> 10:44.557
Chuckie!

10:44.597 --> 10:46.086
Come on in.

10:46.132 --> 10:49.623
Remote control.

10:49.669 --> 10:52.762
Greatest invention
of the 20th century.

10:52.805 --> 10:54.499
Well, have you got it?

10:54.540 --> 10:56.131
No starch.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.640
l always knew

10:57.676 --> 10:59.006
you were a good boy, Chuckie.

10:59.044 --> 11:00.977
lt's Steve.

11:01.013 --> 11:02.707
l know who you are.

11:02.748 --> 11:05.238
You're Rush and Samantha
Sanders' son.

11:05.283 --> 11:06.909
l always liked your mother.

11:06.951 --> 11:09.384
Your father l couldn't stand.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.284
That's why l quit the show.

11:11.322 --> 11:14.779
Your father told everybody
l couldn't remember my lines.

11:14.826 --> 11:17.419
You know what it was
l couldn't remember?

11:17.461 --> 11:18.984
To kiss your father's ass.

11:20.564 --> 11:22.554
l have a little trouble
with that myself sometimes.

11:25.735 --> 11:28.498
Wow... Mm!

11:33.275 --> 11:34.707
You got kids, huh?

11:34.743 --> 11:37.108
l did.

11:37.179 --> 11:38.941
l had a daughter.

11:38.981 --> 11:40.277
l lost her.

11:41.851 --> 11:43.841
A long time ago.

11:43.885 --> 11:45.146
Car accident.

11:51.559 --> 11:54.686
My birth parents died
in a car accident.

11:54.729 --> 11:57.891
Your birth parents?

11:57.931 --> 11:59.124
Yeah, l'm adopted.

11:59.199 --> 12:01.894
Then Rush isn't
your real father.

12:03.437 --> 12:05.802
That explains why
you're such a good kid.

12:09.142 --> 12:12.599
What are you doing here,
Sanders?

12:12.645 --> 12:14.305
My job.

12:14.347 --> 12:15.313
l beg your pardon?

12:15.348 --> 12:17.076
l'm going to fulfill the terms

12:17.116 --> 12:18.605
of my community service.

12:18.651 --> 12:20.481
l'm going to work here

12:20.519 --> 12:21.849
the full 100 hours.

12:21.888 --> 12:24.583
That's very admirable.

12:24.623 --> 12:26.089
But l think you better
be prepared.

12:26.191 --> 12:27.589
This is not a country club.

12:27.626 --> 12:29.286
l'm not going to make
things easy for you.

12:29.327 --> 12:30.657
Fine.

12:30.695 --> 12:32.855
l'm not looking for
the easy way out this time.

12:32.898 --> 12:34.558
Uh, Mr. Warren...

12:34.599 --> 12:37.328
l saw the doctor today.

12:37.368 --> 12:38.595
How nice.

12:38.636 --> 12:41.536
He says l have Jewish
Alzheimer's.

12:41.572 --> 12:43.095
Jewish Alzheimer's?

12:43.140 --> 12:44.504
Yeah.

12:44.541 --> 12:46.633
That's when you forget
everything but the guilt.

12:49.512 --> 12:52.105
Can l see you for a moment,
Mr. Sanders?

12:52.148 --> 12:54.707
Bastard has no sense of humor.

12:54.751 --> 12:56.240
l noticed.

12:59.088 --> 13:01.817
Look, l've seen this before.

13:01.857 --> 13:02.948
What?

13:02.991 --> 13:05.550
lf you think you can
waltz in here,

13:05.594 --> 13:09.051
do your 100 hours and change
these people's lives, forget it.

13:09.131 --> 13:11.621
Leave Saul Howard alone.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.032
Why? So he can just
shrivel up and die?

13:14.069 --> 13:15.592
That's why he's here, Steve.

13:17.038 --> 13:19.870
Don't make it any harder
on him than it has to be.

13:36.690 --> 13:37.656
Hey, hon.

13:37.691 --> 13:38.782
Hi. Sorry l'm late.

13:38.825 --> 13:41.088
l had to stop at the library
and get some books.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.217
No problem.

13:42.261 --> 13:44.558
Guess who
l talked to this morning?

13:44.596 --> 13:45.619
Valerie's mom?

13:45.664 --> 13:46.891
Correct as usual.

13:46.932 --> 13:48.091
And yes, she did know

13:48.200 --> 13:50.565
about Valerie's little jaunt
to Jamaica.

13:50.602 --> 13:51.761
What she couldn't figure out,

13:51.804 --> 13:54.237
is why l was calling her
to ask her if she knew.

13:54.272 --> 13:55.329
Oh, well.

13:55.373 --> 13:57.363
''Oh, well''?
That's all you have to say.

13:57.408 --> 13:59.102
-''Oh, well''?
-What do you want me to say?

13:59.177 --> 14:01.440
l don't know, how about,
''You were right Brandon.

14:01.479 --> 14:02.706
l was wrong about Valerie.''

14:02.747 --> 14:04.509
No, l was wrong about Jamaica.

14:04.549 --> 14:06.209
l still don't trust Valerie.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.343
What has she ever done to you?

14:09.386 --> 14:10.909
She doesn't have to do anything.

14:10.954 --> 14:12.181
Can we just study now?

14:12.222 --> 14:14.314
-Fine. Fine.
-Fine. Fine.

14:14.358 --> 14:15.324
Good.

14:15.359 --> 14:16.325
Hey, Kel.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.690
l thought l heard the doorbell.

14:17.728 --> 14:18.819
Hi.

14:18.862 --> 14:19.953
Listen, l'm glad you're here.

14:19.996 --> 14:21.326
lt saves me a phone call.

14:21.364 --> 14:23.456
-l need to ask you a favor.
-Oh?

14:23.499 --> 14:25.056
Can l borrow your abnormal
psych notes?

14:25.134 --> 14:26.623
l thought you dropped
that course.

14:26.669 --> 14:28.329
Only in spirit.

14:28.371 --> 14:30.065
But you haven't shown up
all semester.

14:30.139 --> 14:32.163
Sure l have.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.300
l only missed a couple classes.
Look, it'll really help me out.

14:34.342 --> 14:38.937
Look, Valerie, l work
my butt off in that class.

14:38.980 --> 14:40.844
Why should l go out of my way
to help someone

14:40.882 --> 14:42.280
who can't even bother
to show up?

14:42.317 --> 14:43.578
l didn't think it was

14:43.618 --> 14:44.845
-that big of a deal.
-Well, it is.

14:44.886 --> 14:45.852
Kel...

14:45.887 --> 14:47.080
Look, l'm sorry

14:47.187 --> 14:49.017
l asked.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.189
You know what? You really go out
of your way to be mean to her.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.093
l can't believe you.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.461
She uses people and you know it.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.988
Come on, Kelly.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.398
lf Donna asked, you'd help her.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.334
Or me,
you'd let me share your notes.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.633
-You guys go to classes--
-So does she.

15:06.672 --> 15:07.763
Brandon, Valerie is a liar

15:07.807 --> 15:10.240
and a user,
and the sooner you wise up,

15:10.276 --> 15:11.640
the better off we'll all be.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.275
lt's open.

15:24.322 --> 15:25.310
Put down the books, guys.

15:25.356 --> 15:26.322
Chow time.

15:26.357 --> 15:27.618
Oh, thank you.

15:27.658 --> 15:28.681
l'm starving.

15:28.726 --> 15:30.352
Good. l got enough for an army.

15:30.394 --> 15:32.554
l wish l had some champagne.
l have the best news.

15:32.596 --> 15:34.028
What?

15:34.065 --> 15:35.998
l talked to Clare and David--
guess who's the headliner

15:36.033 --> 15:38.023
for the opening night of the
Peach Pit After Dark?

15:38.069 --> 15:39.729
l don't know,
uh, Counting Crows?

15:39.769 --> 15:41.599
Nope. You.

15:41.638 --> 15:43.696
-What?
-Yeah, it's all set.

15:43.740 --> 15:45.604
You don't even have to audition.

15:45.642 --> 15:48.075
Look, uh, forget it.

15:48.111 --> 15:49.975
What do you mean?

15:50.013 --> 15:51.809
l'm sorry if you went
to a bunch of trouble,

15:51.847 --> 15:52.870
l'm just not interested.

15:52.915 --> 15:54.711
Why not?

15:57.186 --> 15:58.982
l mean l...
l thought you'd be happy.

15:59.021 --> 16:01.750
Look Donna, l'm a songwriter,
l sing a little bit.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.381
But l'm not
a one-man dance band.

16:03.425 --> 16:05.654
l can't do a show like that--
no way.

16:05.693 --> 16:06.886
Of course you can.

16:06.928 --> 16:08.724
You don't have to do
all your own songs.

16:08.763 --> 16:10.286
-You can do some covers.
-No.

16:10.331 --> 16:13.322
Wait, you want a music career,
but you don't want to perform?

16:13.367 --> 16:15.391
Look,
l'm sorry to disappoint you,

16:15.436 --> 16:16.959
and l really appreciate
what you did,

16:17.004 --> 16:18.868
but l'm not interested.

16:18.905 --> 16:22.135
Fine.

16:22.175 --> 16:24.233
l just don't get it.

16:25.946 --> 16:28.038
Friend named Max
calls me on the phone.

16:28.115 --> 16:30.048
He's 92 years old.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.707
And he tells me,
he's getting married.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.912
l said, ''ls she a good cook?''

16:34.954 --> 16:36.318
He says, ''Well...''

16:36.355 --> 16:39.152
l said,
''ls she good in bed?''

16:39.191 --> 16:41.158
He said, ''She's the worst.''

16:41.193 --> 16:43.456
So l said, ''Well, why
are you marrying her?''

16:43.495 --> 16:45.985
He said,
''Because she drives at night.''

16:50.401 --> 16:52.231
Chuckie...?

16:52.270 --> 16:54.635
Will you come here
a minute, please?

16:54.672 --> 16:55.797
Sit down here, will ya?

16:55.840 --> 16:56.806
Come on, sit down.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.272
l want to show you

16:58.308 --> 17:02.744
a card trick that l learned,
uh, when l was in vaudeville.

17:02.779 --> 17:05.906
l want you to take any card
that you want in the deck

17:05.949 --> 17:07.939
and don't let me force one
on you, okay?

17:07.984 --> 17:10.919
All right...

17:10.953 --> 17:13.750
Okay, look at it, remember it,

17:13.789 --> 17:15.813
Now do as l tell you to do.

17:15.858 --> 17:17.518
Take the card
and tear it in half.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.720
Do it fast, tear it in quarters,

17:19.762 --> 17:21.160
tear it in eighths,

17:21.196 --> 17:22.492
tear it in sixteenths,

17:22.531 --> 17:25.624
tear it in twenty-fours,

17:25.666 --> 17:27.998
Now, you got the little
pieces of the card,

17:28.036 --> 17:29.366
put them in the palm
of your hand.

17:29.404 --> 17:30.870
Your left hand.

17:30.906 --> 17:32.395
Close the palm of
your hand, okay?

17:32.440 --> 17:33.667
Now when l count three,

17:33.708 --> 17:36.574
you throw those pieces
over your head.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.008
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

17:38.045 --> 17:40.410
One, two, three.

17:41.882 --> 17:43.872
Happy New Year!

17:45.786 --> 17:49.118
Steve, what do you
think you're doing?

17:51.791 --> 17:53.451
Get back to work.

17:53.493 --> 17:55.426
This is a nursing home,
it's not a nightclub.

18:00.433 --> 18:03.458
Yeah, how you doing?

18:03.502 --> 18:04.991
Are you gonna help me fold?

18:05.070 --> 18:08.095
Oh, okay, you just sit there
like the princess you are, okay?

18:08.140 --> 18:09.629
l'll just fold the shirts.

18:09.675 --> 18:12.199
Oh, no, no, just don't
get up; that's okay.

18:12.244 --> 18:15.110
So, they meet again
by the spin cycle.

18:15.146 --> 18:17.409
He, with his tiny packets
of fabric softener,

18:17.448 --> 18:20.143
She, folding the clothes
that make the woman.

18:20.184 --> 18:22.117
And, hey, what a folder she is.

18:22.153 --> 18:23.676
Peter, hi, how are you?

18:23.721 --> 18:25.381
l would have been
better if you'd called.

18:25.423 --> 18:27.481
l know, l know, you're
the dedicated babysitter,

18:27.525 --> 18:29.116
the dedicated premed student.

18:29.159 --> 18:30.352
No rest for the wicked.

18:30.393 --> 18:32.383
But, you know, you really
should get out more.

18:32.429 --> 18:33.588
l mean, Laundromats are great,

18:33.630 --> 18:35.290
but not what l'd call
a social life.

18:35.332 --> 18:37.196
Then again, they're not bad
for picking up girls.

18:37.234 --> 18:38.723
You do that often?

18:38.768 --> 18:40.394
Wash clothes? About once
every couple months.

18:40.437 --> 18:41.664
Pick up girls.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.637
Often as l can.

18:43.672 --> 18:47.038
Which isn't that often.

18:47.142 --> 18:48.733
And that's why l have to admit

18:48.777 --> 18:50.744
l was very disappointed
you threw away my number.

18:50.779 --> 18:53.713
How do you know l threw
away your number?

18:53.748 --> 18:55.612
Well, in case you misplaced it,

18:55.650 --> 18:58.209
l could probably be persuaded
to give it to you again,

18:58.253 --> 19:01.346
for old times' sake,

19:01.389 --> 19:03.720
l mean, if you really wanted it.

19:07.928 --> 19:09.792
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

19:16.903 --> 19:19.928
Sorry about before, kid.

19:19.972 --> 19:22.838
l didn't mean to get you into
trouble with Warren at lunch.

19:22.875 --> 19:23.841
l didn't...

19:23.876 --> 19:24.864
lt's no sweat.

19:24.910 --> 19:26.900
l'm a prisoner here, anyway.

19:26.946 --> 19:29.470
l'm a prisoner, too.

19:29.515 --> 19:32.278
You get to serve your time
and leave.

19:32.318 --> 19:34.217
l'm sentenced to life.

19:34.252 --> 19:36.947
Hey, Saul...

19:36.988 --> 19:38.249
Yeah, Chuckie?

19:38.290 --> 19:39.415
Tell you what--

19:39.457 --> 19:41.617
What are you doing tomorrow?

19:41.660 --> 19:43.593
Tomorrow?

19:43.628 --> 19:46.027
l'll have to consult
my appointment calendar.

19:46.130 --> 19:48.029
l'll tell you what--

19:48.098 --> 19:50.031
how about l spring you
from this joint?

19:50.067 --> 19:52.296
l don't think
that's a good idea.

19:52.336 --> 19:53.302
Why not?

19:53.337 --> 19:54.394
You got any better offers?

19:54.438 --> 19:56.405
l'm an old man.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.531
l can't walk far.

19:57.574 --> 19:59.803
Walk? Who said anything
about walking?

19:59.842 --> 20:01.172
l'll drive you door to door.

20:01.210 --> 20:02.403
You like hamburgers?

20:02.445 --> 20:05.038
l like a chicken sandwich
on white toast,

20:05.148 --> 20:07.809
with Dijon mustard, and a couple
of dill pickles on the side.

20:07.850 --> 20:10.181
All right,
chicken sandwich it is.

20:10.219 --> 20:12.015
l know the best place in town.

20:16.325 --> 20:17.882
Look, man, you wanted
my advice, here it is.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.222
Get yourself a good attorney

20:19.261 --> 20:21.057
and throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.926
Hey, l don't beg for mercy.

20:22.964 --> 20:24.521
Come on, Dylan, you were drunk.

20:24.566 --> 20:27.227
They found traces of heroin and
cocaine in your bloodstream.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.235
You drove a car off a cliff.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.863
Look, the only thing you got
going for you right now

20:31.906 --> 20:33.372
is the fact
you didn't hurt anybody

20:33.407 --> 20:35.237
and they didn't find any
evidence in your car.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.073
Yeah, well, obviously, they
didn't look very hard.

20:38.178 --> 20:39.906
What's wrong with you?

20:39.946 --> 20:41.640
What are you trying
to prove here, huh?

20:41.681 --> 20:43.170
l'm not trying to prove
anything, man.

20:43.216 --> 20:44.341
lf l'm guilty, l'm guilty.

20:44.384 --> 20:45.941
l don't need
a lawyer telling me that.

20:45.985 --> 20:47.679
Let them throw the book at me.

20:47.721 --> 20:50.348
Oh, that's very honorable
of you, Dylan.

20:50.390 --> 20:51.481
And very, very stupid.

20:51.523 --> 20:53.080
lf you can manage--
just listen--

20:53.158 --> 20:55.591
lf you can manage to swallow
a little bit of pride here,

20:55.627 --> 20:57.025
you'll get a fine,

20:57.062 --> 20:59.256
probation and they'll take
your driver's license away

20:59.298 --> 21:00.423
for a couple of months.

21:00.466 --> 21:02.023
l don't think so.

21:02.101 --> 21:08.130
All right, listen, you
don't want to believe me...

21:08.172 --> 21:09.433
give this guy a call.

21:11.109 --> 21:13.372
He's good.

21:13.411 --> 21:14.604
Expensive, but good.

21:14.645 --> 21:15.770
Call him.

21:30.426 --> 21:32.188
Hey, what's up?

21:33.362 --> 21:35.488
Saul, baby, up and at 'em!

21:35.531 --> 21:36.861
lt's game day, man!

21:36.899 --> 21:38.525
Come on.
What are you watching TV for?

21:38.567 --> 21:40.864
l thought we were going
to get out of here for a change.

21:40.903 --> 21:42.164
Who are you?

21:42.204 --> 21:43.363
What do you mean, who am l?

21:43.405 --> 21:44.837
What are you doing here
in my room?

21:44.873 --> 21:46.169
l don't know you.

21:46.207 --> 21:48.436
Come on. l'm Steve. Chuckie?

21:48.476 --> 21:50.238
l don't have any money.
Leave me alone.

21:50.278 --> 21:51.676
Who needs money?
l got lots of money.

21:51.713 --> 21:52.701
lt's my treat. Come on.

21:52.747 --> 21:54.805
l told you
l don't have any money!

21:54.849 --> 21:56.076
l don't have anything.

21:56.150 --> 21:57.343
Now, get the hell out of here!

21:57.384 --> 21:58.850
Are you joking with me?

21:58.886 --> 22:00.182
Come on.
What are you talking about?

22:00.220 --> 22:01.186
l'm not doing anything wrong.

22:01.221 --> 22:02.187
l'm going to call a nurse.

22:02.222 --> 22:03.153
That's what l'm going to do.

22:03.190 --> 22:04.451
Nurse! Nurse!

22:04.491 --> 22:06.458
-Help me! l'm being robbed!
-Saul, what are you...?

22:06.493 --> 22:07.584
Robbed?!
l'm not robbing you.

22:07.628 --> 22:08.924
You know what l'm talking about!

22:08.962 --> 22:11.589
He's stealing my Emmy.
Don't let him steal my Emmy.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.860
Oh, no.
Everything's all right.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.230
Don't let him do it.

22:15.268 --> 22:16.757
No one's stealing anything,
Mr. Howard.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.827
He was about to get
up there and steal it.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.838
-l would never do that, Saul.
-Look, here, Mr. Howard.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.533
-Here it is.
-You're in... Oh.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.507
Safe and sound. See?

22:24.543 --> 22:26.237
l want you to take it easy.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.437
Nurse, l didn't do anything.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.002
l know. l know.

22:29.047 --> 22:30.741
Maybe you better wait
in the hall.

22:30.782 --> 22:34.581
Now, l just want you to rest
and take it easy, all right?

22:34.619 --> 22:36.518
Just rest.
l don't want you worrying.

22:36.554 --> 22:39.351
All right...

22:39.390 --> 22:40.879
What's wrong with him?

22:40.925 --> 22:42.323
How come he doesn't remember me?

22:42.359 --> 22:43.848
Mr. Howard has Alzheimer's.

22:43.894 --> 22:46.054
He doesn't remember you.

22:46.163 --> 22:49.757
He's confused, and he's scared.

22:49.799 --> 22:51.732
How long is that going to last?

22:51.768 --> 22:54.497
Who knows?
lt comes and goes.

22:54.537 --> 22:57.767
Maybe a few days,
maybe a few minutes.

22:57.807 --> 23:01.207
And eventually,
for the rest of his life.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.221
Where you been, Chuckie?

23:22.263 --> 23:24.321
l've been waiting here
for two hours.

23:24.365 --> 23:26.127
l thought we were going out.

23:26.167 --> 23:27.224
Are you okay?

23:27.268 --> 23:28.928
No. l'm hot.

23:28.969 --> 23:30.595
l got my overcoat on.

23:30.637 --> 23:32.433
Come on. Let's go, huh?

23:32.472 --> 23:33.631
Maybe it's not such a good idea.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.401
What are you talking about?

23:35.442 --> 23:37.966
You sold me on a chicken
sandwich on white toast.

23:38.011 --> 23:39.409
With Dijon mustard.

23:39.446 --> 23:41.310
And pickles, too.

23:41.347 --> 23:42.335
Okay. Come on.

23:42.381 --> 23:43.608
-Yeah.
-Let's get out of here.

23:43.649 --> 23:46.344
That's better.

23:47.887 --> 23:49.877
Boy, what a car!

23:49.922 --> 23:51.855
lt's a Corvette.

23:51.891 --> 23:53.881
l'm old, not blind.

23:55.260 --> 23:57.056
You know, l had a Corvette once.

23:57.128 --> 23:59.288
A '59.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.628
Yeah. Maroon and cream.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.293
-Oh!
-Beautiful color.

24:04.335 --> 24:05.596
Oh, yeah.

24:05.637 --> 24:06.898
-l'll drive.
-Yeah, right.

24:06.937 --> 24:08.904
l'll show you my license.

24:08.939 --> 24:10.530
Look, don't give me a hard time.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.541
l'm lucky l got you out
of the home.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.669
Well, who's going to know
if l'm going to drive?

24:15.712 --> 24:17.770
Come on, l'll do the driving.

24:17.814 --> 24:19.610
Eh...

24:21.617 --> 24:24.016
Come on, Chuckie.
Let me drive, please.

24:24.053 --> 24:25.576
No.

24:25.621 --> 24:27.713
lt's like riding a bicycle.

24:27.757 --> 24:28.848
You never forget.

24:28.891 --> 24:31.017
Saul, you're not driving.

24:31.127 --> 24:32.650
l got a driver's license.

24:32.694 --> 24:33.990
l'll show it to you.

24:34.029 --> 24:36.462
But don't look at the date.

24:37.399 --> 24:38.387
Oh, come on.

24:38.433 --> 24:39.729
l said you're not driving.

24:39.768 --> 24:41.928
Let me tell you something.

24:41.970 --> 24:43.561
When you get to be my age,

24:43.605 --> 24:47.233
and it's your last chance
to drive a snazzy car like this,

24:47.274 --> 24:49.707
you'll always remember
what l just said.

24:49.743 --> 24:52.506
Don't forget that.

24:52.546 --> 24:54.775
This is it.

24:54.815 --> 24:56.645
-Oh...
-This is the Peach Pit.

24:56.684 --> 24:58.173
Peach Pit, huh?

24:58.218 --> 24:59.616
Saul Howard.

24:59.652 --> 25:01.744
l'd know that face anywhere.

25:01.788 --> 25:03.618
You're not a cop, are you?

25:03.656 --> 25:05.247
Come on.

25:05.291 --> 25:07.815
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

25:07.860 --> 25:10.919
This is Andrea
and her baby Hannah.

25:10.964 --> 25:12.396
-Hi.
-Cute baby.

25:12.431 --> 25:13.362
And that's David.

25:13.398 --> 25:14.421
-Hello, David.
-How you doing?

25:14.466 --> 25:16.228
Clare. Donna.

25:16.268 --> 25:17.564
-Hello, Donna.
-Hello.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.001
-My friend Brandon.
-How you doing, Saul?

25:19.071 --> 25:21.231
And, last but not
least, that's Kelly.

25:21.273 --> 25:24.730
-Hi.
-Kelly, huh?

25:24.775 --> 25:29.370
Boy, if l only had my health.

25:29.413 --> 25:33.371
Steve says you do some
great card tricks, Mr. Howard.

25:33.417 --> 25:37.352
Just so happens that
l have a deck of cards

25:37.388 --> 25:38.854
right here in my pocket.

25:38.888 --> 25:41.549
Hey, you want to know something?

25:41.591 --> 25:43.649
l'm one of the only
eight guys in the world

25:43.693 --> 25:45.660
who can do this trick
that l'm going to show you.

25:45.695 --> 25:46.820
l'll do it with you, blondie,

25:46.863 --> 25:48.830
'cause you wanted it done.

25:48.865 --> 25:50.798
Now, here's 52 cards, right?

25:50.833 --> 25:52.993
52 cards--
you don't want to count them.

25:53.035 --> 25:54.729
Let me shuffle them up for you.

25:58.607 --> 25:59.937
You want to cut them?

25:59.975 --> 26:01.464
-Oops!
-Oh, l'm sorry.

26:01.510 --> 26:05.036
l just did that
so l could touch your knee.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.137
All right, now...

26:07.181 --> 26:09.205
l'm going to fan
the deck to you.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.446
52 cards-- l want you to look
at any card in the deck

26:12.487 --> 26:14.750
and remember it--
and after you remember it,

26:14.789 --> 26:16.585
l want you to tell it
to this young man

26:16.624 --> 26:17.988
sitting here--
whisper it in his ear.

26:18.025 --> 26:19.355
Don't let anybody
else hear it, okay?

26:19.393 --> 26:20.359
Okay.

26:20.394 --> 26:21.360
All right. You ready?

26:21.395 --> 26:22.656
Uh-huh.

26:23.697 --> 26:25.755
-Do you see the card?
-Uh-huh.

26:25.799 --> 26:27.698
Tell the card
to this gentleman here.

26:29.736 --> 26:31.362
You remember the card?

26:31.404 --> 26:32.563
ls it red or black?

26:32.605 --> 26:33.662
-Black.
-Black.

26:33.706 --> 26:35.263
Three of spades.

26:43.848 --> 26:46.042
The Buchanans of Broadway
was my all-time favorite movie.

26:50.388 --> 26:51.911
Was l in that?

26:53.958 --> 26:56.221
Yeah, l think so.

26:57.928 --> 27:01.090
Steve said that you won an Emmy.

27:01.131 --> 27:02.859
What was it for?

27:04.601 --> 27:07.592
Um...

27:10.606 --> 27:12.971
l can't remember.

27:13.042 --> 27:15.407
Playhouse 90.

27:15.445 --> 27:19.244
Oh... Oh, that's right.

27:19.282 --> 27:20.339
lt was Playhouse 90.

27:21.784 --> 27:23.478
What's Playhouse 90?

27:23.518 --> 27:25.314
l think it was on cable.

27:25.353 --> 27:29.550
Hey, you want to...
you want to see a great trick?

27:29.591 --> 27:31.285
A good card trick?

27:31.326 --> 27:33.919
There's only eight people
in the world that can

27:33.962 --> 27:35.428
do this trick and l'm...
l'm one of the eight

27:35.463 --> 27:36.394
that can do this trick.

27:36.430 --> 27:38.522
Now, what l want
to do... l want to...

27:38.566 --> 27:40.556
There's 52 ca--
l'll do it with you, blondie.

27:40.601 --> 27:42.192
Saul, you know what?
l think we've had enough

27:42.236 --> 27:43.827
card tricks for one day.
How about some lunch?

27:43.871 --> 27:44.996
What are you talking about?!

27:45.072 --> 27:46.834
l'm right in the middle
of a trick right here.

27:46.874 --> 27:47.840
Saul...

27:47.875 --> 27:49.136
Oh, don't give me that ''Saul...''

27:49.175 --> 27:50.505
And don't step on my lines!

27:50.543 --> 27:51.702
What's the matter?

27:51.745 --> 27:53.712
Didn't your mother ever teach
you anything about timing?

27:53.747 --> 27:55.270
Here we go.

27:55.315 --> 27:57.248
Chicken sandwich just
the way you like it.

27:57.283 --> 27:58.613
Nat, you know what?

27:58.651 --> 28:00.277
Maybe you should
wrap this up, take it home.

28:00.320 --> 28:00.842
Um... Saul's tired.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.581
Tired?!

28:02.621 --> 28:04.485
l am not tired!

28:04.523 --> 28:07.491
Come on. Let's get out of here.

28:07.526 --> 28:09.117
Let's go home.

28:09.161 --> 28:10.787
You're running out of jokes,
Saul.

28:10.829 --> 28:12.523
The day that l run out of jokes,

28:12.564 --> 28:15.327
that'll be the day
Henny Youngman tells a new one.

28:15.366 --> 28:17.333
Who's Henny Youngman?

28:17.368 --> 28:21.497
Youngman... he's the king
of the one-liners,

28:21.539 --> 28:24.302
'cause the dummy
can't remember two.

28:29.312 --> 28:30.778
Jesse, it's not coming down.

28:30.814 --> 28:32.246
lt's still over 103.

28:32.282 --> 28:33.942
She's burning up.

28:33.984 --> 28:35.382
lt's still over 103.

28:35.418 --> 28:37.351
She's been that way
for a couple of hours.

28:37.387 --> 28:39.718
Uh-huh... Okay, great.

28:39.756 --> 28:40.779
Jesse, what'd they say?

28:40.823 --> 28:42.346
Well, it's not uncommon
for an infant

28:42.391 --> 28:43.914
to run a high fever like that,

28:43.959 --> 28:45.721
but we need to take her
in anyway.

28:45.761 --> 28:46.749
lt's better safe than sorry.

28:46.796 --> 28:48.194
lt's all right, sweetheart.

28:48.230 --> 28:49.821
-lt's okay, it's okay.
-Honey, it's okay.

28:49.865 --> 28:50.853
Lookie, lookie, look!

28:50.900 --> 28:51.991
Look, sweetie;
all right, sweetie.

28:52.067 --> 28:53.499
lt's all right, baby.
You're all right.

28:56.971 --> 28:59.438
David, wake up!

28:59.474 --> 29:01.498
You're supposed to be studying.

29:01.543 --> 29:04.477
l'm taking the information
in through osmosis.

29:04.512 --> 29:05.944
l tried that in high school.

29:05.980 --> 29:08.709
lt didn't work.

29:08.749 --> 29:10.340
-Hey, Ray.
-Hey.

29:10.384 --> 29:11.816
Hey, Donna said you
finally broke down

29:11.852 --> 29:13.716
and agreed to do the show, huh?

29:13.754 --> 29:15.186
What?

29:15.222 --> 29:17.587
We're holding a slot open
for you opening night.

29:18.625 --> 29:21.821
Really.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.829
Donna, can l, uh, see you
for a minute... alone?

29:24.864 --> 29:26.330
-Ray.
-Now.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.524
Sure.

29:33.471 --> 29:35.233
Do l have to spell it out
for you?

29:35.273 --> 29:37.069
l do not want
to play at this club.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.337
How many times do l have
to tell you the same thing?

29:39.377 --> 29:40.968
l just don't get it,
what's the big deal?

29:41.079 --> 29:42.067
lt's a great gig.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.342
Yeah, and l don't want it, okay?

29:44.382 --> 29:45.473
You know, l don't understand.

29:45.516 --> 29:46.982
Everyone is bending over
backwards for you,

29:47.084 --> 29:48.141
and you don't even care.

29:48.185 --> 29:49.583
All you want to do
is show me off,

29:49.620 --> 29:51.519
so you can tell your mother
what a big star l am.

29:51.555 --> 29:52.714
Leave my mother out of this.

29:52.756 --> 29:53.983
Oh, did l hit a nerve?

29:54.024 --> 29:55.718
You know, my mother
has nothing to do with this.

29:55.759 --> 29:56.850
l was trying to help you.

29:56.894 --> 29:58.383
Donna,
l didn't ask for your help,

29:58.428 --> 30:00.395
and l don't want it,
so mind your own business

30:00.430 --> 30:01.919
and stop meddling
in my life, okay?

30:08.471 --> 30:10.404
lt's going to be okay,
honey, don't worry.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.236
Hannah Zuckerman-Vasquez?

30:12.274 --> 30:14.298
Here.

30:17.980 --> 30:19.344
Peter?

30:19.381 --> 30:21.814
Andrea.

30:21.850 --> 30:24.215
You two guys know each other?

30:24.253 --> 30:26.777
Uh, well, we met
in the Laundromat.

30:26.821 --> 30:30.654
Uh, Peter, this is my husband,
Jesse Vasquez, and...

30:30.691 --> 30:32.920
and, well, you remember
our daughter Hannah?

30:32.960 --> 30:35.359
Yes, uh, certainly.

30:35.396 --> 30:37.226
Uh, what seems to be the...
the problem?

30:37.265 --> 30:39.425
Well, she's been running
a high fever for a few hours.

30:39.466 --> 30:41.023
lt doesn't seem
to want to come down.

30:41.067 --> 30:42.363
Well, let's have a look,
shall we?

30:42.402 --> 30:43.561
Okay.

30:56.248 --> 30:58.579
Here's your water.

30:58.617 --> 31:00.049
Did you let it run?

31:00.085 --> 31:01.847
Yes, l let it run.
lt's cold.

31:05.556 --> 31:06.852
You're a good kid, Chuckie.

31:06.891 --> 31:09.552
No matter what else Rush did,

31:09.594 --> 31:11.185
he raised a good boy.

31:11.229 --> 31:14.322
Look, do me a favor, okay?

31:14.365 --> 31:15.661
Don't mention his name.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.860
l'm not talking to
my father right now.

31:17.901 --> 31:19.458
Don't say that.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.491
Please.

31:20.537 --> 31:23.164
The most important thing
is family.

31:23.206 --> 31:26.003
Yeah.

31:26.043 --> 31:27.373
Tell that to my old man.

31:27.411 --> 31:29.435
l don't even think he knows
what the word means.

31:29.479 --> 31:31.412
What are you bitching about?

31:31.447 --> 31:33.346
You got it so bad?

31:33.382 --> 31:35.747
Look at you. You got your
whole life ahead of you.

31:35.785 --> 31:38.810
Why don't you
stop complaining?

31:42.391 --> 31:43.687
l hate my father.

31:43.725 --> 31:45.487
He makes my life miserable.

31:45.527 --> 31:47.892
My daughter hated me, too.

31:47.929 --> 31:50.726
She said l worked too hard.
She was right.

31:50.765 --> 31:54.029
l was always on the road,
and when l was around,

31:54.069 --> 31:55.660
l fought with that kid
night and day,

31:55.703 --> 32:00.036
till we finally stopped talking.

32:00.140 --> 32:02.835
Months went by.

32:02.876 --> 32:04.843
Then, one day,
l call her on the phone,

32:04.878 --> 32:08.973
and l said, ''l just
want you to know, honey...

32:09.015 --> 32:11.983
''no matter what happened
between us,

32:12.018 --> 32:14.815
darling, l love you
and l'll always love you.''

32:18.358 --> 32:20.222
Two weeks later...

32:20.259 --> 32:22.249
l lost her.

32:24.629 --> 32:30.863
But l thank God every day
l made that phone call.

32:30.902 --> 32:31.959
Chuckie.

32:32.004 --> 32:34.631
Listen to me.

32:34.673 --> 32:37.334
Do the right thing.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.535
Don't let too much time go by

32:39.577 --> 32:41.168
before you make up
with your father.

32:41.212 --> 32:44.271
Otherwise,

32:44.315 --> 32:48.910
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

32:55.291 --> 32:56.450
Good night, Saul.

32:59.996 --> 33:01.895
Chuckie?

33:01.930 --> 33:02.896
Yeah.

33:02.931 --> 33:05.899
l know l'm losing my mind.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.168
No, you're not.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.260
You're gonna be fine.

33:09.304 --> 33:10.827
Nah.

33:10.873 --> 33:13.136
Today was just a good day.

33:13.175 --> 33:16.632
So, if l do anything strange,

33:16.677 --> 33:22.239
please... please don't
let it bother you, huh?

33:24.218 --> 33:25.650
Don't worry, Saul.

33:27.020 --> 33:29.078
Thanks, kid.

33:58.049 --> 34:00.016
l spoke to your pediatrician.

34:00.051 --> 34:02.610
She feels there's really
no reason to keep Hannah here.

34:02.654 --> 34:05.486
Her fever's down, and...

34:05.523 --> 34:07.422
these things just happen
with infants occasionally.

34:07.458 --> 34:13.327
Well, at least
she's finally asleep.

34:13.362 --> 34:15.455
Would you step
outside for a minute?

34:17.266 --> 34:18.995
Sure.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.647
Hannah spent the first
four months of her life

34:32.681 --> 34:33.647
in this hospital.

34:33.681 --> 34:35.273
l hated bringing her here.

34:35.317 --> 34:37.841
Why didn't you tell me
Hannah was your baby?

34:37.886 --> 34:39.318
You didn't ask.

34:39.353 --> 34:41.184
Oh, come on.

34:41.223 --> 34:43.985
Thanks.

34:44.025 --> 34:45.958
l guess when you thought l was

34:45.993 --> 34:47.755
the babysitter, l have
to admit, for that one

34:47.795 --> 34:49.853
brief moment, l wanted
to see what it was like

34:49.897 --> 34:52.489
not being a mom or a wife
with too much laundry.

34:52.533 --> 34:54.795
At least now l know
why you didn't call.

34:54.835 --> 34:56.266
l thought l was losing my touch.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.963
You can rest easy.

34:58.005 --> 35:00.472
Mrs. O'Brien, telephone please.

35:00.507 --> 35:02.940
Mrs. O'Brien.

35:02.976 --> 35:05.136
Listen, Andrea,
you're not the only one

35:05.178 --> 35:08.613
who left out some relevant data.

35:08.648 --> 35:09.773
Guilty.

35:11.650 --> 35:12.775
Are you married?

35:12.818 --> 35:14.944
My wife likes to think so.

35:15.954 --> 35:16.920
l can't believe it.

35:16.955 --> 35:18.148
lt's funny how neither of us

35:18.190 --> 35:19.383
bothered to look for those

35:19.424 --> 35:20.856
little telltale rings
till now, isn't it?

35:22.194 --> 35:25.162
lf you're married,
what were you doing

35:25.196 --> 35:27.129
flirting with a babysitter
in the Laundromat?

35:27.165 --> 35:29.291
Do you really have
to ask that question...

35:29.333 --> 35:30.424
Ms. Fluff 'n' Fold?

35:30.468 --> 35:32.367
Or should l say missus?

35:32.403 --> 35:34.734
Hey, l've never done anything
like that before in my life.

35:34.772 --> 35:36.568
And you assume l have?

35:36.607 --> 35:38.665
Miss Aaron, telephone please.

35:38.708 --> 35:41.642
l don't know what to think.

35:41.678 --> 35:42.837
About any of this.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.641
Look, the short version
of the story is,

35:44.681 --> 35:47.979
l got married way too young...
for all the wrong reasons.

35:48.018 --> 35:49.917
and now l'm paying
the price, same as you.

35:49.953 --> 35:52.512
-lt's not the same as me at all.
-lsn't it?

35:52.555 --> 35:54.317
When did you decide
to get married,

35:54.356 --> 35:56.448
before or after you flunked
the home pregnancy test?

35:56.492 --> 35:58.049
That's none of your business.

36:00.663 --> 36:03.130
Mrs. Hernandez,
front desk, please.

36:03.165 --> 36:04.722
Mrs. Hernandez.

36:18.178 --> 36:19.166
Hello?

36:19.213 --> 36:21.146
Kelly? Listen, it's Valerie.

36:21.181 --> 36:23.114
Did you oversleep or something?
Our psych final's

36:23.150 --> 36:24.616
in about five minutes.

36:25.986 --> 36:27.577
Oh, my God. l did.
l-l overslept.

36:27.621 --> 36:28.917
Well, hurry up, and l'll

36:28.956 --> 36:30.752
just tell the proctor
you're on your way, okay?

36:30.790 --> 36:32.780
Okay, l appreciate it, Valerie.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.156
Hey, Sanders.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.786
You're becoming a regular
fixture around here.

36:37.830 --> 36:39.091
Well, don't get used to it.

36:39.131 --> 36:40.620
Well, listen,
you've been a great help.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.825
Thanks.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.197
Sure.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.499
Hi.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.005
Big fella!

36:50.675 --> 36:52.005
That's nice.

37:01.018 --> 37:02.348
Saul?

37:08.458 --> 37:10.789
Come on, Picasso.

37:10.827 --> 37:11.884
You can do it.

37:19.869 --> 37:20.960
Come on.

37:33.148 --> 37:34.705
l guess it's time to rest, huh?

37:39.320 --> 37:40.752
That's okay.

37:40.788 --> 37:42.311
That's okay.

37:42.356 --> 37:44.585
You've already painted
your masterpiece.

38:04.576 --> 38:05.940
Give me a second.

38:06.945 --> 38:08.241
Boy, it took a little longer

38:08.280 --> 38:10.110
than l expected in there.
How'd it go, man?

38:10.149 --> 38:11.308
Well, not so good.

38:11.350 --> 38:12.577
What do you mean?

38:12.618 --> 38:13.914
What do l mean?
l mean, that's

38:14.018 --> 38:15.382
some pretty crummy
advice you gave me.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.216
l can't believe l ever
even listened to you.

38:17.255 --> 38:18.585
Wait, wait, what happened?

38:20.625 --> 38:23.525
l'll tell you what happened.

38:23.561 --> 38:26.290
l got probation
for about a year.

38:26.331 --> 38:28.798
They just took my license
for a couple of months.

38:28.832 --> 38:29.855
You bum. That's great, man!

38:29.900 --> 38:30.923
Yeah, man. Thanks.

38:31.034 --> 38:32.796
You know,
you've got a really lousy

38:32.836 --> 38:34.029
sense of humor.
You know that.

38:34.071 --> 38:35.469
Yeah, but l got you, didn't l?

38:35.505 --> 38:37.597
What, for maybe, oh,
l don't know, one second?

38:37.641 --> 38:38.937
Yeah, maybe two seconds.

38:38.975 --> 38:40.271
Hey, you need a lift?

38:40.309 --> 38:42.276
No, thanks.
l think l better get used

38:42.311 --> 38:43.937
to taking
the public transportation

38:43.979 --> 38:45.969
for a while, anyway,
you know what l mean?

38:46.849 --> 38:48.076
-Have a safe ride.
-All right.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.981
-Kiss the wife for me.
-Will do.

38:59.661 --> 39:01.093
Oh, guys, relax.
We'll get it.

39:01.129 --> 39:02.425
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

39:02.464 --> 39:03.657
Thanks.

39:04.566 --> 39:05.998
Go on.

39:06.033 --> 39:07.659
-Okay, we're going. We're going.
-Going. Going.

39:07.701 --> 39:08.792
Okay.

39:11.205 --> 39:12.364
Brandon,

39:12.406 --> 39:14.896
would you take the
trash out or something?

39:14.975 --> 39:16.566
ls that a cue
for me to leave?

39:16.610 --> 39:17.906
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm. Don't kill each other

39:17.945 --> 39:19.275
while l'm gone.

39:22.949 --> 39:24.108
Valerie...

39:24.150 --> 39:25.480
l just wanted to thank you

39:25.518 --> 39:26.814
for what you
did this morning.

39:26.853 --> 39:27.910
No biggie.

39:27.954 --> 39:30.285
You would've done
the same for me, right?

39:32.624 --> 39:34.921
So, how'd you do on the test?

39:34.960 --> 39:36.256
You mean, did l pull through

39:36.294 --> 39:38.727
without the benefit
of your notes?

39:38.764 --> 39:39.730
Yeah.

39:39.765 --> 39:41.823
You can stop
feeling guilty now.

39:44.302 --> 39:46.929
Look, l'm trying
to say l'm sorry.

39:46.971 --> 39:49.803
l've been... a bitch.

39:49.840 --> 39:50.828
l owe you one.

39:51.842 --> 39:53.809
Yeah. You do.

39:53.844 --> 39:57.108
But one of these days,
l'll collect.

40:08.858 --> 40:10.188
Saul!

40:11.527 --> 40:13.494
Saul, it's me.

40:13.529 --> 40:16.156
Nat sent over some fresh
peach pie for you.

40:20.536 --> 40:21.866
That's okay, it'll keep.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.303
lt's a beautiful day outside.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.831
Do you want to take
a walk or something?

40:29.877 --> 40:32.606
Maybe go down to the rec room,
do some card tricks?

40:43.190 --> 40:44.884
l know what you want to do.

41:07.512 --> 41:08.705
Steve.

41:09.948 --> 41:11.938
Where have you been?

41:11.983 --> 41:14.177
l've been looking all over
the place for you.

41:14.219 --> 41:17.278
You called me ''Steve,''
not ''Chuckie.''

41:17.321 --> 41:18.582
Course l did.

41:18.622 --> 41:20.145
What do you think l am, senile?

41:20.190 --> 41:21.816
You've known my name all along.

41:21.859 --> 41:23.917
You've been calling me Chuckie
to drive me nuts, huh?

41:23.961 --> 41:25.359
Did it work?

41:25.395 --> 41:27.294
Come on,
let's go for a ride.

41:27.331 --> 41:30.163
Sure. Sure.

41:30.199 --> 41:31.961
Only under one condition.

41:32.001 --> 41:33.160
What's that?

41:33.202 --> 41:34.168
That l drive.

41:34.203 --> 41:35.499
You're not driving.

41:35.538 --> 41:36.970
Don't tell me
l'm not driving.

41:37.073 --> 41:38.369
Please, come on,
let me drive.

41:38.407 --> 41:39.566
l got a license.

41:39.609 --> 41:40.597
Forget it.
You're not driving.

41:40.643 --> 41:41.631
l'm older than you are.

41:41.677 --> 41:42.643
Well, so?

41:42.677 --> 41:43.665
Let me have the keys.

41:43.712 --> 41:44.700
Come on, Saul.
