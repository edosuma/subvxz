01:52.743 --> 01:54.653
Hiya.

15:11.271 --> 15:12.515
Arthur, it's Harry.

15:12.550 --> 15:14.438
I've been trying to get ahold
of you for three days.

15:14.470 --> 15:17.853
-What's the matter?
-I gotta see you.

15:18.983 --> 15:20.324
Now. Please.

15:20.359 --> 15:22.780
-One hour.
-Arthur, I've got big trouble.

15:32.647 --> 15:34.622
It just doesn't
make any sense, Arthur.

15:34.663 --> 15:37.084
They said I broke the agreement.

15:37.127 --> 15:39.996
Day before yesterday,
they stopped answering my calls.

15:40.038 --> 15:41.696
What can I do?

15:41.735 --> 15:46.492
Give 'em a call.
Say a few words on my behalf.

15:46.535 --> 15:48.771
I wouldn't know who.

15:55.558 --> 15:58.624
Why should they listen to me?
I'm no part of that.

15:58.663 --> 16:01.958
No, but your father was.
A very important part.

16:01.991 --> 16:05.340
His brains helped put the whole
thing together for 'em.

16:05.383 --> 16:08.350
They still talk about him
like he was a patron saint.

16:08.390 --> 16:09.819
You've got his name.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.710
Please, Arthur?

16:12.742 --> 16:14.019
It's all I've got.

16:21.287 --> 16:22.716
Thanks.

16:22.759 --> 16:24.352
Save it.

16:24.391 --> 16:26.147
Come on outside.
Let's have a drink.

16:26.182 --> 16:27.971
You know,
I've given a good many years.

16:28.007 --> 16:31.203
Me and your father both.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.742
How many friends you think
I got right now, huh?

16:38.791 --> 16:39.903
What?

16:39.943 --> 16:43.204
I was just thinkin'.
Remember that fishin' trip...

16:43.239 --> 16:46.501
that you and me and your father
took up to Canada?

16:46.534 --> 16:48.476
You was about eight, right?

16:48.518 --> 16:51.006
Seven or eight.

16:51.047 --> 16:52.257
You fell overboard.

16:52.294 --> 16:53.603
You couldn't swim.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.541
Your old man says,
"He'll learn pretty fast."

16:56.582 --> 16:59.965
You were floppin' around.
You looked like a drowned rat.

17:00.007 --> 17:01.916
But you didn't say a word.

17:01.958 --> 17:03.649
You didn't yell for help
or nothin'.

17:03.687 --> 17:06.142
You just kept lookin'
at your old man...

17:06.182 --> 17:08.320
and he didn't make a move.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.268
Well, pretty soon
I had to reach out...

17:10.310 --> 17:12.612
and grab you by the hair
and pull you in the boat.

17:12.646 --> 17:14.501
You looked like a drowned rat.

17:14.534 --> 17:19.007
Your old man,
he laughed like hell.

17:19.047 --> 17:23.105
That was a long time ago.

17:25.063 --> 17:26.307
Hey, what are you drinkin'?

17:26.342 --> 17:29.124
We've got vodka...

17:29.159 --> 17:32.093
we got scotch, bourbon.

17:35.367 --> 17:38.782
Arthur, this is my son Steve.

17:38.822 --> 17:40.993
Steve, this is Mr. Bishop.

17:41.031 --> 17:43.332
Hi. How are you?

17:43.366 --> 17:45.788
I need some bread, Dad.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.871
What are you talkin' about?
Why, just this morning I was--

17:47.911 --> 17:49.504
I only need a thousand.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.607
Besides,
my asking you for money...

17:52.647 --> 17:54.883
makes you feel
I'm dependent on you.

17:54.919 --> 17:56.861
Kinda ties us together.

17:56.903 --> 17:58.081
Fast, huh?

17:58.119 --> 18:00.290
Chromosomes will tell.

18:00.327 --> 18:02.880
He's got a point.

18:02.919 --> 18:04.991
My father gets uptight
when I ask him for money...

18:05.031 --> 18:06.110
he steals from other people.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.874
Steve, that's enough.

18:09.766 --> 18:12.155
Don't get excited.
It's bad for you.

18:12.198 --> 18:15.548
Nice to meet you.
Drop by any time, huh?

18:15.591 --> 18:17.631
Any friend of Big Harry's...

18:19.110 --> 18:20.485
I know you gotta go.

18:20.518 --> 18:22.623
I'm sorry about that.

18:22.663 --> 18:24.223
Forget it.

18:24.262 --> 18:25.724
I just don't understand him
anymore.

18:25.766 --> 18:27.708
It's just so...

18:27.750 --> 18:29.638
Well, call me
when you know something, OK

18:29.670 --> 18:31.165
OK.

18:32.775 --> 18:35.295
Take care of yourself.

19:34.823 --> 19:36.416
Arthur Bishop?

19:37.382 --> 19:38.560
I have a special delivery.

19:38.598 --> 19:40.933
Certified. Please sign here.

22:01.990 --> 22:03.998
Mr. Bishop?

22:04.038 --> 22:06.623
We would like you
to go ahead...anytime.

22:19.366 --> 22:21.276
-Nothin' else, huh?
-Nothin' else.

22:21.318 --> 22:23.041
You're to wait down there...

22:23.079 --> 22:25.599
and I wait for you
at the top of the hill.

22:25.638 --> 22:27.940
Well, could you tell anything
by his voice?

22:27.975 --> 22:29.567
I mean the tone?

22:29.606 --> 22:32.835
Harry, stay loose.

22:32.870 --> 22:34.496
Yeah, sure.

22:36.358 --> 22:39.293
It's like you say, if they're
willin' to talk, well...

22:41.638 --> 22:44.224
Harry, I'll be parked
right up there.

22:44.262 --> 22:46.466
Say, don't you think that...

23:17.990 --> 23:20.292
Hello?!

23:29.030 --> 23:32.063
Well, I'm here!

23:36.358 --> 23:38.463
Come on, let's talk.

23:45.639 --> 23:47.427
You said we were gonna talk!

23:55.686 --> 23:58.469
Harry, run to the car.

23:58.502 --> 24:02.080
-It's a set-up.
-I can't!

24:07.846 --> 24:10.781
I'll try to get behind him.

24:10.822 --> 24:12.611
Run!

24:26.342 --> 24:29.026
Oh, God.

24:29.062 --> 24:31.779
I can't--

24:35.430 --> 24:37.023
Keep going!

24:37.062 --> 24:38.950
I can't.

25:03.590 --> 25:04.735
You?

25:09.126 --> 25:11.941
This is it, huh?

25:16.102 --> 25:18.851
Finish it, Arthur.

25:18.886 --> 25:20.162
You or me.

25:20.198 --> 25:23.646
Finish it.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.604
I had a feeling.

25:52.646 --> 25:54.785
Can I come in?

26:04.902 --> 26:07.291
Oh, my darling,
it's been so long.

26:10.374 --> 26:12.414
I said I wasn't gonna do this.

26:12.454 --> 26:14.429
I had it all worked out.

26:14.470 --> 26:17.088
I go to the door,
there you are.

26:17.126 --> 26:21.152
I smile, very poised,
as if I just saw you yesterday.

26:21.190 --> 26:23.394
I'm sorry.

26:23.430 --> 26:25.569
Nothing's changed.

26:25.605 --> 26:28.093
It never does.

26:30.502 --> 26:34.179
OK, I think
I've got it together.

26:36.165 --> 26:39.427
You know...

26:39.462 --> 26:40.923
I think you've lost some weight.

26:44.518 --> 26:46.111
I wrote you a letter.

26:48.102 --> 26:50.819
I couldn't mail it.

26:50.854 --> 26:52.894
I didn't know where.

26:52.934 --> 26:56.676
I keep moving around.

26:56.710 --> 26:58.139
It's true, you know.

26:58.182 --> 27:00.353
I do always know
when you're near.

27:00.390 --> 27:01.917
ESP.

27:01.958 --> 27:04.543
Maybe.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.429
What's the matter, baby?

27:07.462 --> 27:08.956
Well, I've been here
about three minutes...

27:08.998 --> 27:10.940
and you've managed about
one recrimination a minute.

27:10.982 --> 27:15.684
I can't seem to feel anything
but hurt when you're not here.

27:15.718 --> 27:19.875
I guess when I see you again,
I just have to hurt back.

27:21.285 --> 27:24.449
Did you really
write me a letter?

27:28.486 --> 27:30.974
"My dearest love...

27:31.014 --> 27:32.388
"I'm once again alone."

27:32.422 --> 27:33.632
I can't hear you.

27:33.670 --> 27:35.011
"And the silence in this room...

27:35.046 --> 27:39.202
"presses against my ears
until I'm deafened.

27:39.238 --> 27:42.107
"This is the way I live
until I see you again...

27:42.150 --> 27:45.052
"and then you're here
and there's no past.

27:45.094 --> 27:47.265
"Only the two of us.

27:47.302 --> 27:49.986
"I know these words hurt you...

27:50.022 --> 27:52.705
"because you can't give
anything but the moment...

27:52.742 --> 27:55.044
"but I have to write them now...

27:55.078 --> 28:00.413
"because somehow my need
for you must find its voice.

28:00.453 --> 28:04.796
"And you - what of your pain?

28:04.838 --> 28:07.173
"If you could only
let me have...

28:07.206 --> 28:09.246
"one small part
of the weight of it."

28:10.628 --> 28:12.285
Don't read anymore.

28:12.326 --> 28:14.016
Don't you see?

28:14.054 --> 28:16.704
Even that would be a comfort
to me when you're not here.

28:16.742 --> 28:19.393
Oh, my darling,
I love you so much. I can't --

28:19.430 --> 28:21.056
Don't.
It's gonna be all right.

28:21.094 --> 28:23.363
Oh, baby, I love you.

28:23.398 --> 28:24.924
Oh, my darling.

28:27.046 --> 28:29.763
Darling, take us to bed.

28:29.798 --> 28:33.027
Baby, I missed you.
I'm so glad you're here.

28:33.062 --> 28:35.004
I love you.

28:46.054 --> 28:48.705
It'll be a hundred more
this time.

28:51.814 --> 28:54.018
The letter took me
a while to make up.

28:57.926 --> 28:59.038
All right?

28:59.078 --> 29:04.195
Yes. The letter was good.

29:04.230 --> 29:06.237
Try to think of something
like it for next time.

29:06.278 --> 29:09.377
OK, I will.

29:11.878 --> 29:14.267
To his community and church...

29:14.310 --> 29:18.205
he gave his resources,
his faith, and his spirit.

29:18.246 --> 29:21.661
His good works comfort us
in the going.

29:21.702 --> 29:24.516
We commit his remains
to your earth, O, Father...

29:24.550 --> 29:28.227
and we pray you
vouchsafe him eternal life.

29:28.261 --> 29:30.650
I've always been interested
in primitive rituals...

29:30.693 --> 29:33.693
Iike tucking the dead away.

29:33.734 --> 29:37.476
Glory be to the Father
and to the Son...

29:37.509 --> 29:39.484
and to the Holy Spirit.

29:39.525 --> 29:44.032
Glory be to the father,
Harry McKenna...

29:44.070 --> 29:46.012
fixer extraordinaire...

29:46.053 --> 29:51.291
pusher, pimp, thief, arsonist.

29:51.334 --> 29:53.221
You liked him a lot?

29:53.254 --> 29:56.603
Oh, yeah.
He was my kind of man.

29:56.646 --> 29:59.745
What was your connection
with him?

29:59.782 --> 30:03.492
He worked for my father
a long time back.

30:03.525 --> 30:05.947
He thought I could
do him a favor.

30:05.990 --> 30:09.023
So, your old man was in, huh?

30:09.062 --> 30:12.128
And you?

30:12.165 --> 30:14.554
Don't you think you should be...

30:16.998 --> 30:18.459
Yeah, you got somethin' goin'.

30:18.502 --> 30:22.692
You're pretty sure of yourself.

30:22.725 --> 30:25.954
I live in my mind, Mr. Bishop.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.899
Sounds like something
I read someplace.

30:27.941 --> 30:29.851
And so do you.

30:31.494 --> 30:33.119
Could I have a ride home?

30:35.302 --> 30:36.862
Sure.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.848
Amen.

31:01.285 --> 31:04.002
Come on. Steve's got
the whole place outside.

31:04.038 --> 31:06.012
Good old Steve!

31:08.486 --> 31:10.941
What are they celebrating?

31:10.981 --> 31:13.403
Well, this is all mine now.

31:19.973 --> 31:22.973
My father never really
liked my friends...

31:23.013 --> 31:24.671
and I'm not so sure I do,
either.

31:24.710 --> 31:28.190
Hey, we've got a call here
from Katmandu.

31:28.230 --> 31:30.685
Hey, Katmandu's calling, Sam.

31:33.413 --> 31:36.283
Yes, I placed a call
to Sydney, Australia.

31:36.326 --> 31:38.300
We got the White House.

31:50.566 --> 31:51.678
Yes, I want to speak--

31:53.190 --> 31:54.978
Yeah. No, listen, I live there.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.257
I know he's there.

31:56.294 --> 31:58.203
It's all in the bubbles.

32:01.734 --> 32:05.050
Yeah, emergency.
I must speak to him. John Lenn--

32:07.173 --> 32:09.028
Hey, Steve,
Louise is on the phone.

32:09.062 --> 32:10.338
Sounds important, man.

32:12.933 --> 32:15.715
-Afghanistan here.
-No, I didn't call Afghanistan.

32:19.301 --> 32:21.156
-Hello, Louise?
-Are you with her?

32:22.246 --> 32:24.613
-You don't love me.
-That kinda talk is foolish.

32:24.645 --> 32:26.172
I'm gonna kill myself.
I wanna die.

32:26.213 --> 32:28.220
-Louise, please.
-I do.

32:28.262 --> 32:31.523
-Well, go ahead then.
-I will. You don't care.

32:31.558 --> 32:32.900
Yeah, that's right.
I don't care.

32:32.933 --> 32:34.307
Right--

32:34.342 --> 32:36.862
My friends are so happy,
they're killing themselves.

32:42.885 --> 32:44.227
Would you come along?

33:04.517 --> 33:06.306
Who's he?

33:06.341 --> 33:07.902
He's a friend of the family's.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.309
I thought
you'd already started.

33:10.341 --> 33:12.796
Oh, no.
I wanted you to watch.

33:12.838 --> 33:15.772
Now, let me see
if I've got everything.

33:15.814 --> 33:20.287
Ice cubes, wine, razor blades.

33:20.325 --> 33:23.489
How long does it take?

33:23.525 --> 33:24.867
I don't know.

33:24.902 --> 33:27.804
Sure you do.
You know everything.

33:29.381 --> 33:31.553
Louise,
you called me because...

33:31.590 --> 33:34.973
either you don't want to do it,
and you want me to stop you...

33:35.014 --> 33:37.185
or you want to lay
the guilt of it on me...

33:37.221 --> 33:38.716
and I'm not buying either one.

33:38.758 --> 33:42.784
So go ahead on.

33:45.062 --> 33:46.141
Hold on.

33:48.293 --> 33:51.741
Mind if I have
a little wine first?

33:51.781 --> 33:53.756
You son of a bitch.

33:55.493 --> 33:57.500
Mr. Bishop?

33:57.541 --> 33:59.134
Not for me, thanks.

34:00.421 --> 34:03.488
You really don't believe.

34:03.525 --> 34:05.248
Baby.

34:05.286 --> 34:09.661
I call you baby because
your innocence touches me so.

34:24.453 --> 34:27.005
Those really are sharp,
aren't they?

34:37.222 --> 34:40.484
I always said
that you had guts, Louise.

34:40.516 --> 34:43.746
About how long will it take?

34:43.782 --> 34:45.789
Mr. Bishop?

34:45.829 --> 34:47.650
How much do you weigh?

34:47.685 --> 34:49.822
110.

34:51.525 --> 34:54.143
Two and a half to three hours.

34:54.181 --> 34:56.668
At first you'll get cold,
and then sleepy.

34:58.086 --> 35:00.737
You're a son of a bitch, too.

35:00.773 --> 35:03.588
Louise, I haven't had
anything to eat yet today.

35:03.621 --> 35:04.996
What you got in the fridge?

35:09.189 --> 35:11.044
Thanks.

35:13.221 --> 35:17.499
I know he'll stop me.

35:17.542 --> 35:19.451
I know he will.

35:19.493 --> 35:24.065
I know he feels something.

35:33.158 --> 35:35.133
I know you.

35:38.981 --> 35:40.126
What?

35:41.317 --> 35:44.317
I didn't hear you, baby.
What'd you say?

35:44.357 --> 35:46.878
I said you'll stop it.

35:46.917 --> 35:50.332
Listen.
If you don't care anything...

35:50.374 --> 35:52.162
about your own life,
then why should I?

35:52.197 --> 35:56.224
You do care. You do.

35:56.261 --> 35:58.563
And you do, too.

36:03.077 --> 36:05.892
I'm cold.

36:08.774 --> 36:10.716
I'm getting colder.

36:10.757 --> 36:13.178
I'm cold.

36:13.222 --> 36:14.628
Psychosomatic.

36:14.661 --> 36:17.149
You've got an hour
and a half left.

36:17.189 --> 36:18.466
Please, Steve.

36:18.501 --> 36:21.021
I don't want to do it.

36:26.181 --> 36:27.872
If you kick it...

36:27.909 --> 36:29.600
you can probably make
the sheriff's station...

36:29.638 --> 36:32.605
in Malibu
in about fifteen minutes.

37:01.830 --> 37:03.488
Would you have let it happen?

37:03.525 --> 37:07.322
Would you?
Look, I was just an observer.

37:07.365 --> 37:09.056
You haven't answered
my question.

37:09.093 --> 37:10.817
Well, what do you think?

37:10.854 --> 37:13.537
We'll never know, will we?

37:13.573 --> 37:16.323
Well, say
that I just sat there...

37:16.357 --> 37:19.139
or we just sat there
and watched her check out.

37:19.173 --> 37:20.602
Think that
would have been crazy?

37:20.645 --> 37:22.467
Irrational, maybe.

37:22.501 --> 37:23.995
Is there anything wrong
with that?

37:24.037 --> 37:26.688
It just means that you
have your own rule book.

37:28.677 --> 37:30.400
I can dig that.

37:30.437 --> 37:33.284
Is that so?

37:33.317 --> 37:35.073
It takes a very special
kind of person...

37:35.109 --> 37:37.531
to pick up the tab
for that kind of living.

37:37.573 --> 37:41.501
You say you dig it,
but you're talkin' about...

37:41.541 --> 37:43.429
something you really
know nothing about.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.087
And you do?

37:45.125 --> 37:48.354
Do I?

37:48.389 --> 37:50.178
Very slippery.

37:50.213 --> 37:53.759
When he's cornered, he answers
questions with questions.

37:53.797 --> 37:56.099
What's your action, Mr. Bishop?

37:56.133 --> 37:59.265
You've been watching
too many late movies.

37:59.301 --> 38:00.959
Well, it's been interesting.

38:00.998 --> 38:04.064
Thanks. Maybe another time.

39:16.485 --> 39:18.459
The underwater feeding show...

39:18.501 --> 39:21.730
by Marineland's staff diver
in the giant fish tank.

39:21.765 --> 39:23.936
The giant fish tank
is to your left...

39:53.285 --> 39:54.659
Next of kin?

39:54.693 --> 39:56.318
None.

39:56.357 --> 39:58.299
Anybody we can notify?

39:59.621 --> 40:01.988
How about an acquaintance?

40:02.021 --> 40:03.198
Are you finished, doctor?

40:03.237 --> 40:04.481
No, there's a charge.

40:04.517 --> 40:06.721
You can take care of it at the
cashier's window one floor up.

40:06.758 --> 40:09.092
I suggest that you make
an appointment with your doctor.

40:09.125 --> 40:12.573
That is, if you have a doctor.

40:12.614 --> 40:15.134
What do you think?

40:15.173 --> 40:17.475
What'd you feel
before you passed out?

40:17.509 --> 40:18.687
Couldn't get my breath.

40:18.726 --> 40:20.580
Palms sweating?

40:21.573 --> 40:23.198
Nausea? Heart beating fast?

40:24.933 --> 40:26.843
Sounds like an A.R.

40:26.885 --> 40:29.732
Acute anxiety reaction.

40:29.765 --> 40:31.325
Classic neurasthenic pattern.

40:31.365 --> 40:35.587
See a doctor, Mr. Bishop.
Have some tests.

40:35.621 --> 40:37.792
If they come back negative...

40:37.830 --> 40:40.863
maybe you should think
about seeing a psychiatrist.

40:40.901 --> 40:42.363
In the meantime, take these.

40:42.405 --> 40:44.674
They'll help a little.

40:44.708 --> 40:46.716
I need a signature, Doc.

40:46.757 --> 40:48.612
Hey, you were really
out there for a while.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.364
The cashier, you say,
is on the first floor?

40:55.909 --> 40:58.877
Dr. Richmond
wanted in Emergency.

40:58.917 --> 41:01.121
Watch your backs, please.

41:01.157 --> 41:02.434
Thank you.

41:47.141 --> 41:50.338
You waitin' for me?

41:50.373 --> 41:53.504
How long you been here?

41:53.541 --> 41:56.291
Since last night, about 12:00.

41:56.325 --> 41:59.838
Must be important.

41:59.877 --> 42:02.299
You said another time.

42:02.341 --> 42:05.210
I said maybe another time.

42:05.253 --> 42:09.279
That's right.
That's what you said.

42:11.973 --> 42:14.144
Come on in.

42:18.981 --> 42:22.243
So this is what it looks like
inside your head, huh?

42:22.277 --> 42:23.935
This place must've cost
some bread.

42:23.973 --> 42:25.697
Are you still trying
to figure my action?

42:27.013 --> 42:29.730
I inherited enough.

42:32.677 --> 42:35.133
It is nice to be comfortable,
isn't it?

42:36.613 --> 42:39.908
Is there something specific
you want to talk about?

42:39.941 --> 42:43.258
No, I just...

42:43.301 --> 42:45.210
Well, yeah, there is.

42:45.253 --> 42:48.101
What happened the other night,
that was pretty far out...

42:48.133 --> 42:49.508
and you were saying
some things about it.

42:49.541 --> 42:50.916
So?

42:50.949 --> 42:52.924
So, how 'bout some answers?

42:52.965 --> 42:54.656
To what?

42:54.693 --> 42:57.759
For openers,
suppose I say I think...

42:57.797 --> 42:59.357
I'm the kind of person...

42:59.397 --> 43:01.666
that can pick up the tab
for what happened?

43:01.701 --> 43:03.457
What's the rest of it?

43:03.493 --> 43:05.598
What makes you think
I can answer that?

43:05.637 --> 43:07.043
You said that--

43:07.077 --> 43:09.444
I said that you didn't know
anything about it.

43:09.477 --> 43:11.451
It doesn't mean I do.

43:12.613 --> 43:14.784
Now you see him, now you don't.

43:16.581 --> 43:18.403
Is my time up?

43:18.437 --> 43:20.542
There is something
I have to do.

43:20.580 --> 43:22.009
Can I come?

43:23.909 --> 43:26.298
What do you want from me?

43:36.357 --> 43:38.299
That's incredible.

43:38.341 --> 43:39.868
Yeah. It keeps me sharp.

43:39.909 --> 43:42.080
Balance,
problems of orientation--

43:42.117 --> 43:43.905
sometimes you have
to think in reverse.

43:49.573 --> 43:50.718
Here, you take it.

44:05.925 --> 44:07.780
That's not bad.

44:07.813 --> 44:09.788
How long you been flying?

44:09.829 --> 44:12.317
About twenty seconds.

44:17.220 --> 44:20.930
My father
was what they called a judge.

44:20.965 --> 44:23.136
He would settle arguments
on the council...

44:23.173 --> 44:25.028
and his word was final.

44:25.061 --> 44:26.849
It was never questioned...

44:26.885 --> 44:29.219
until one day
some hothead from Chicago...

44:29.252 --> 44:31.805
took exception
to one of his decisions...

44:31.845 --> 44:33.732
and put a contract on him.

44:33.765 --> 44:39.907
The guy that got him
was a shooter from Topeka.

44:39.941 --> 44:41.403
That was all.

44:41.445 --> 44:42.852
How old were you then?

44:42.884 --> 44:44.259
Your age.

44:44.293 --> 44:46.977
Maybe younger.
I was still in school.

44:47.013 --> 44:49.599
You find this interesting,
don't you?

44:49.637 --> 44:51.066
Are you kidding?

44:51.109 --> 44:53.979
My father used to do
front numbers even for me.

44:54.021 --> 44:56.192
Like if he did that,
maybe it wouldn't rub off.

44:56.229 --> 44:58.978
Never talk about that stuff.

44:59.012 --> 45:00.387
He was beautiful.

45:00.420 --> 45:03.933
Only trouble was,
I really wanted to dig it.

45:03.973 --> 45:07.268
He wanted me to be
a part of his front, too.

45:13.317 --> 45:15.870
So, what happened
after they burned your old man?

45:15.909 --> 45:17.054
I finished school.

45:17.092 --> 45:18.685
And?

45:18.725 --> 45:20.765
That's all. Then I grew up.

45:20.805 --> 45:22.627
Did your father ever tell you
anything about the operation...

45:22.660 --> 45:23.806
Iike how it worked?

45:25.124 --> 45:26.553
What's with those guys, anyway?

45:26.596 --> 45:28.484
They all act
like they're ashamed.

45:28.517 --> 45:31.102
My father wasn't ashamed.
He was the best.

45:50.948 --> 45:52.061
Game.

45:52.101 --> 45:53.246
You're pretty good.

45:56.069 --> 45:59.385
-Play to win, do you?
-You know any other way?

45:59.429 --> 46:01.251
Let's make it two out of three.

46:01.285 --> 46:05.343
OK, but I'm telling you,
I'm genius at this game.

46:05.381 --> 46:07.520
Yeah?
You go get the ball, genius.

46:12.645 --> 46:15.427
What's going on?

46:15.460 --> 46:17.697
That old man is Yamoto.

46:17.732 --> 46:20.220
He's here from Japan,
where he's a master.

46:21.572 --> 46:23.842
The other guy is Kori.

46:23.877 --> 46:26.692
Very dangerous and very fast...

46:26.724 --> 46:28.153
but he's got some new tricks...

46:28.197 --> 46:30.498
that are sort of an insult
to the old style.

46:30.533 --> 46:32.322
Yamoto thinks these tricks...

46:32.357 --> 46:33.698
are useless
against a classic fighter...

46:33.733 --> 46:35.195
and he's here
to prove his point.

46:36.517 --> 46:41.373
The object of these fights is
total concentration and control.

46:41.413 --> 46:43.453
They don't actually
hit each other...

46:43.492 --> 46:45.597
otherwise one or the other
would be dead...

46:45.636 --> 46:48.451
and that's against the law.

47:16.325 --> 47:19.424
I thought he wasn't
supposed to hit him.

47:19.461 --> 47:21.916
Probably
one of Kori's new tricks.

47:52.101 --> 47:54.108
You haven't said three words
since the match.

47:55.877 --> 47:58.332
He practically
murdered that guy.

47:58.372 --> 48:01.219
Murder is only killing
without a license...

48:01.252 --> 48:03.107
and everybody kills.

48:03.141 --> 48:05.988
Governments,
the military, the police.

48:06.020 --> 48:09.599
Do you think
that Yamoto's a killer?

48:09.637 --> 48:12.026
He's a killer who doesn't kill.

48:12.068 --> 48:14.654
It's funny.

48:15.652 --> 48:19.481
For him,
the rules are important.

48:19.525 --> 48:21.052
That's your expert opinion?

48:22.757 --> 48:24.218
That's my opinion.

48:24.260 --> 48:26.083
OK. Don't get uptight.

48:26.116 --> 48:29.083
-Not me.
-Bullshit.

48:29.125 --> 48:31.678
Look, every time we're on this
subject, the same thing happens.

48:31.717 --> 48:33.604
As long as we're rapping it out
on your terms...

48:33.637 --> 48:36.288
everything's OK, but the minute
I have a question...

48:36.324 --> 48:38.212
or I want to know
something specific from you...

48:38.244 --> 48:40.994
you either shine me on
or go out for coffee.

48:43.044 --> 48:44.800
What the hell is going on?

48:44.837 --> 48:46.746
You're pressing pretty hard.

48:46.788 --> 48:48.611
You'd better be damn sure
you want to know.

48:48.644 --> 48:51.033
This is not
freshman philosophy time.

48:51.076 --> 48:52.286
I'm sure.

49:00.324 --> 49:01.753
You ever hear
the term "mechanic"...

49:01.796 --> 49:03.684
used outside
of its normal meaning?

49:04.741 --> 49:05.885
Where?

49:05.924 --> 49:09.023
My father used it.
It's a dealer.

49:09.060 --> 49:11.297
A guy who works game tables.

49:11.332 --> 49:13.023
Anything else?

49:13.060 --> 49:16.705
Sure. It's a shooter.

49:16.740 --> 49:18.463
A hit man.

49:19.876 --> 49:21.021
So?

49:23.012 --> 49:24.441
So there we are.

49:26.500 --> 49:29.697
And that's your action?

49:29.732 --> 49:30.976
Yeah, that figures.

49:33.284 --> 49:34.877
I'm telling you this...

49:34.917 --> 49:38.212
because there are times
when I could use a backup.

49:38.245 --> 49:41.922
Wouldn't have
to spread myself so thin.

49:41.956 --> 49:46.211
And you seem
to have the aptitude.

49:46.244 --> 49:47.902
You do this for money?

49:49.829 --> 49:53.887
Money is paid,
but that's not the motive.

49:53.924 --> 49:59.904
It has to do with standing
outside of it all on your own.

50:00.997 --> 50:04.259
I'm gonna teach you all I can.

50:04.292 --> 50:08.253
After that, you can choose
how you want it to go.

50:09.221 --> 50:11.839
-You in?
-Do I have an alternative?

50:12.932 --> 50:15.780
There are alternatives
to everything.

50:17.157 --> 50:19.524
You've got a partner,
Mr. Bishop.

50:19.556 --> 50:21.083
Associate.

50:26.917 --> 50:30.365
Point the gun as though it were
an extension of your arm...

50:30.404 --> 50:33.022
and keep both eyes open.

50:33.061 --> 50:35.100
All right, you ready? Pull.

50:36.804 --> 50:39.805
That's better. Much better.

50:40.805 --> 50:41.950
Pull.

50:44.133 --> 50:45.376
Winchester.

50:45.412 --> 50:47.900
300 Magnum, 180 grains.

50:49.093 --> 50:51.711
Muzzle velocity.

50:51.748 --> 50:52.894
Pull!

50:54.820 --> 50:56.446
3,070.

50:56.484 --> 50:58.273
Drop at 200 yards.

51:00.197 --> 51:02.368
Two minutes low. Pull!

51:04.101 --> 51:06.621
300 yards.

51:06.660 --> 51:07.806
Pull.

51:10.532 --> 51:12.158
5.3 inches.

51:12.196 --> 51:15.742
300 yards, 150 grains.

51:17.029 --> 51:19.003
4.8 inches.

51:19.045 --> 51:20.954
Pull.

51:23.012 --> 51:24.157
Doubles.

51:25.221 --> 51:26.814
Pull.

51:32.356 --> 51:34.745
There are killers,
and there are killers.

51:34.788 --> 51:35.933
To tell you the truth...

51:35.973 --> 51:37.947
they all have
a different book of rules.

51:37.989 --> 51:40.160
To get away with it
depends on the book of rules...

51:40.196 --> 51:42.946
you have in your pocket
at the time.

51:42.980 --> 51:46.177
Your own country,
somebody else's country...

51:46.212 --> 51:49.474
or your own personal
book of rules.

51:49.509 --> 51:51.897
All this--heroes.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.843
Half of them were killers.

51:54.884 --> 51:59.008
Napoléon was one, you know?
Pancho Villa, Genghis Khan.

51:59.044 --> 52:01.149
And then we have
our own domestic brand...

52:01.188 --> 52:06.458
Iike Billy the Kid, Jesse James,
and John Dillinger.

52:06.501 --> 52:07.745
Yeah, they're about as famous...

52:07.780 --> 52:09.504
as our own
honest-to-goodness heroes.

52:09.540 --> 52:11.678
Don't tell me
that's gonna make us heroes.

52:12.740 --> 52:14.333
I wouldn't tell you
anything like that.

52:14.373 --> 52:16.642
All I'm saying is that people
who stand outside the law...

52:16.676 --> 52:19.043
oftentimes end up as heroes.

52:24.004 --> 52:27.998
What's with that ball of wax
I see you squeezing?

52:28.036 --> 52:30.403
Sometimes you have
to hold the mark.

52:30.437 --> 52:32.924
It develops the strength.

52:38.564 --> 52:40.539
"In the ages
between 45 and 64...

52:40.580 --> 52:41.857
"of the total deaths
by accident...

52:41.892 --> 52:45.504
"10,431 were from falls."

52:45.541 --> 52:49.217
You know, falls from
high places are very clean.

52:49.252 --> 52:50.975
What's that?

52:51.013 --> 52:53.184
That is your first involvement.

53:13.572 --> 53:16.223
Taking the Zoo Drive turnoff.

53:17.252 --> 53:19.107
Now they're going west.

54:52.164 --> 54:53.855
There's one camera.

54:56.740 --> 54:57.885
Another.

54:58.980 --> 55:01.282
Two cameras
covering the main gate.

55:16.292 --> 55:17.917
You couldn't
get within 100 yards...

55:17.956 --> 55:19.744
without tripping
that alarm system.

55:23.172 --> 55:25.987
The guards sleep in shifts.

55:26.020 --> 55:28.159
One of them awake all the time.

55:28.197 --> 55:29.506
What about number one?

55:29.540 --> 55:32.475
Midnight till 4:00
in the morning.

55:34.692 --> 55:37.278
We need more.

55:37.316 --> 55:42.367
We'll have to stay in closer
until we find something.

55:42.404 --> 55:46.495
I want you to rent two cars,
a Ford and a Volkswagen.

56:03.044 --> 56:05.052
This looks like
it might be something.

56:10.596 --> 56:11.740
Turn this on.

56:20.228 --> 56:22.333
Comes across the border
at 1 a.m.

56:22.372 --> 56:25.274
I can have it to you
at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

56:25.316 --> 56:26.461
How?

56:26.500 --> 56:30.013
In a Chicken Lickin' truck
right to your place.

56:30.052 --> 56:33.532
OK. You check the goods
when it comes, then wake me.

56:33.572 --> 56:35.394
I'll make the test.

56:35.428 --> 56:37.795
Better not be crap.

56:37.829 --> 56:39.967
You know where to find me.

56:41.700 --> 56:43.937
Well, they'll have
to turn off the alarm system...

56:43.972 --> 56:45.249
to make that delivery.

56:46.244 --> 56:47.738
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

56:47.781 --> 56:51.326
One of the tools of the trade,
my friend.

56:58.884 --> 57:00.510
Allied Plating. This is Frank.

57:00.548 --> 57:03.363
Listen, I've got a bumper
that needs re-chroming.

57:03.395 --> 57:07.706
If I brought it in tomorrow,
can I pick it up by Saturday?

57:07.748 --> 57:09.536
We don't work
on Saturday down here.

57:09.572 --> 57:11.066
Monday afternoon the soonest.

57:11.108 --> 57:13.628
Monday's all right.
I'll bring it in tonight.

57:24.676 --> 57:26.170
Since there's no guard
on the weekends...

57:26.212 --> 57:27.619
at the Allied Plating plant...

57:27.652 --> 57:29.986
we could put the bodies
in these nitric acid tanks.

57:36.836 --> 57:38.047
Mr. Bishop?

57:38.084 --> 57:39.807
We would like you
to go ahead with this one.

57:45.540 --> 57:46.947
We go.

57:59.012 --> 58:00.768
I'm gonna check you for iron
before you go past here.

58:00.804 --> 58:03.105
-Come on, get out.
-What's the matter?

58:03.140 --> 58:04.384
Come on. Get out of there.

58:07.300 --> 58:08.577
What the hell is this?

58:27.748 --> 58:28.893
Chicken Lickin'.

59:08.708 --> 59:12.504
Chicken Lickin'
is lickin' chicken.

59:12.547 --> 59:13.889
Wise guy.

01:01:04.388 --> 01:01:06.046
Get the bodies in the truck!

01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:47.200
Do you know my dog
got a birthday card today?

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:49.538
I didn't. Just my dog.

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:52.125
Archibald, those kids
on the hill there--

01:01:52.164 --> 01:01:54.018
how can you live here
with all that noise?

01:01:54.052 --> 01:01:56.899
I called the police,
but there's nothing they can do.

01:02:40.676 --> 01:02:43.064
Daddy, it's getting worse here
every weekend.

01:04:37.572 --> 01:04:38.816
In forty-eight hours...

01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:41.023
everything will be in solution.

01:04:47.428 --> 01:04:49.217
It was...

01:04:49.251 --> 01:04:50.495
What?

01:04:50.531 --> 01:04:52.255
Well, it could've been
so simple...

01:04:52.291 --> 01:04:54.812
but that guy
came out of nowhere.

01:04:54.852 --> 01:04:56.761
Those things happen...

01:04:56.803 --> 01:04:58.265
but remember it the next time.

01:05:02.916 --> 01:05:05.599
Could you spare a few minutes,
Mr. Bishop?

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:06.879
Yes. When?

01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:09.282
Now. I'm at home.

01:05:09.315 --> 01:05:10.460
All right.

01:05:14.467 --> 01:05:16.409
I have to do something
for a while.

01:05:16.451 --> 01:05:17.728
I'll see you later.

01:06:37.731 --> 01:06:39.803
Mr. Bishop is here, sir.

01:06:39.844 --> 01:06:41.251
Show him through.

01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:46.208
This way, sir.

01:07:05.315 --> 01:07:08.511
That was very untidy,
Mr. Bishop.

01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:13.027
We'd like to know how
Harry McKenna's son figures.

01:07:13.059 --> 01:07:15.263
He'll be working with me
from now on.

01:07:16.291 --> 01:07:18.430
You think this is wise?

01:07:22.563 --> 01:07:24.800
You telling me
I need your permission?

01:07:26.468 --> 01:07:30.330
Information is all I want,
Mr. Bishop.

01:07:30.372 --> 01:07:32.411
We like to know things.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.931
An organization survives
only because its members...

01:07:36.963 --> 01:07:39.745
are willing to sacrifice
certain personal choices...

01:07:39.779 --> 01:07:42.878
for the good of all.

01:07:42.915 --> 01:07:45.566
A very democratic principle,
Mr. Bishop.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.594
We survive
because we have this rule.

01:07:53.283 --> 01:07:55.967
What you or I want
is unimportant.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.765
Only the rule.

01:08:04.228 --> 01:08:07.326
Someone trained by me
could be of value to you.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.529
Nobody lives forever.

01:08:22.883 --> 01:08:25.152
You take
full responsibility then?

01:08:28.228 --> 01:08:31.392
This one has to be done fast.
Very fast.

01:08:36.452 --> 01:08:38.394
I'll handle it
the way I always do.

01:08:38.435 --> 01:08:40.639
There may not be
time enough for that.

01:08:41.923 --> 01:08:45.948
The word is, he's getting ready
to talk to some people.

01:08:45.987 --> 01:08:49.370
The problem is considerable.

01:08:49.411 --> 01:08:51.265
I'm not some wild
Cleveland shooter.

01:08:51.299 --> 01:08:53.154
I don't cowboy.

01:08:53.187 --> 01:08:56.897
If he talks, things
could get complicated...sloppy.

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:59.233
That would disturb a lot of us.

01:08:59.267 --> 01:09:02.332
It's not really open
to discussion, Mr. Bishop.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:04.194
This business
of McKenna's son...

01:09:04.228 --> 01:09:07.544
has upset
a few of our associates.

01:09:07.587 --> 01:09:09.180
I understand it...

01:09:09.219 --> 01:09:11.969
but these people
see it only from the outside.

01:09:12.002 --> 01:09:14.872
A quick, clean job
would go a long way...

01:09:14.915 --> 01:09:17.663
in putting everything
back into proper balance.

01:09:23.011 --> 01:09:24.920
Yes, I understand.

01:09:24.964 --> 01:09:27.647
I knew you would.

01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:29.024
Your man's in Naples.

01:09:31.684 --> 01:09:33.822
We've given you
a name in Rome...

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:36.031
for any equipment
you might need.

01:12:20.388 --> 01:12:22.111
Good. You're still up.

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:26.369
I called you about 9:00.

01:12:26.404 --> 01:12:29.218
Yeah, well,
Louise picked me up and we...

01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:31.771
It's good for the nerves.
She has this thing she does--

01:12:31.812 --> 01:12:33.056
Spare me the details.

01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:34.651
Look, if I'd known
you wanted to work--

01:12:34.691 --> 01:12:37.081
You are a free agent, my friend.
The only thing you have to do...

01:12:37.123 --> 01:12:39.839
is fulfill the requirements
of the Association.

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.631
And that means
your occasional presence...

01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:43.555
some intelligent responses,
some skill at your work...

01:12:43.588 --> 01:12:44.765
and nothing more.

01:12:44.803 --> 01:12:47.552
You've got that,
so what's buggin' you?

01:12:52.355 --> 01:12:54.014
We got one, huh?

01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:56.604
They want him to be cowboyed.

01:12:58.403 --> 01:12:59.744
Explain.

01:12:59.779 --> 01:13:01.208
They want me to get him now...

01:13:01.251 --> 01:13:02.495
any way I can.

01:13:02.532 --> 01:13:03.840
That doesn't sound very cool.

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:05.664
What are you gonna do
about that?

01:13:07.971 --> 01:13:10.175
I'm too far along
to change my habits.

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:12.350
I'll do what I've always done...
in Italy.

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:15.486
Italy? Am I gonna go?

01:13:17.187 --> 01:13:18.333
Why not?

01:13:48.227 --> 01:13:50.682
Steve McKenna.

01:13:50.723 --> 01:13:53.440
Mountain View Drive.

01:13:53.475 --> 01:13:55.515
Age twenty-four.

01:13:55.555 --> 01:13:59.133
Height - five foot, eleven inches.

01:13:59.171 --> 01:14:03.100
Weight - 165.

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:05.375
Right-handed.

01:14:05.411 --> 01:14:08.281
Hair - blond.

01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:11.454
Distinguishing marks -

01:14:11.491 --> 01:14:15.168
small scar on right arm.

01:14:15.203 --> 01:14:20.189
Interests - girls, freaks...

01:14:20.228 --> 01:14:22.398
physical fitness...

01:14:22.435 --> 01:14:24.377
fast cars...

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:26.786
and killing.

01:14:32.227 --> 01:14:34.682
Just like the postcards.

01:14:34.723 --> 01:14:37.308
Let's go to work.

01:15:05.955 --> 01:15:07.101
What time?

01:15:09.379 --> 01:15:11.800
It's 11:47.

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:22.779
Good?

01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:25.023
Last time I had this
was ten years ago.

01:15:25.059 --> 01:15:26.750
They make it right here,
you know...

01:15:28.227 --> 01:15:29.950
But not enough to export.

01:15:29.987 --> 01:15:33.248
Casa de fiori doesn't travel.

01:15:35.299 --> 01:15:37.404
It's not bad.

01:15:37.443 --> 01:15:39.353
Slowly.

01:15:39.395 --> 01:15:42.046
The time you take
is very important.

01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:43.545
Savor it.

01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:47.071
Even what we're doing now.

01:15:48.547 --> 01:15:51.416
See, you must
figure it carefully.

01:15:51.459 --> 01:15:53.598
Don't rush.

01:15:53.635 --> 01:15:55.969
Know every move, turn it
over and over in your mind...

01:15:56.002 --> 01:15:58.010
until you're sure
there are no holes.

01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:02.488
But you have to be
dead sure...or dead.

01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:04.353
No second chances.

01:16:04.387 --> 01:16:05.848
I'll try and remember that.

01:16:05.891 --> 01:16:07.779
Remember, don't try.

01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:11.160
Dead sure...or dead.

01:16:53.187 --> 01:16:56.733
The room's not going
to get any bigger.

01:16:58.242 --> 01:17:02.203
I think I'll take a walk.
Is that all right with you?

01:18:02.882 --> 01:18:04.573
What now?

01:18:04.611 --> 01:18:06.847
It looks like
they're going south.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.705
We could follow
on the Coast Road.

01:18:28.803 --> 01:18:32.032
Excuse me, sir. Would you take
a picture of my wife and me?

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.123
Thank you.

01:19:58.819 --> 01:20:02.496
It seems he doesn't do the same
thing the same way twice.

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:07.899
Except spend Friday
and Saturday night on that boat.

01:20:10.883 --> 01:20:14.014
A diesel leak explosion
might be nice.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:17.149
Yeah, but how do we
get close enough?

01:20:18.371 --> 01:20:19.581
You scuba?

01:20:22.787 --> 01:20:24.859
Yeah. Sure.

01:20:24.898 --> 01:20:26.491
Good.

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.319
I'll go down to Rome,
pick up some equipment...

01:20:28.354 --> 01:20:30.460
and be back tomorrow night.

01:20:32.834 --> 01:20:35.965
Meanwhile, you study this chart,
especially this area right here.

01:20:36.003 --> 01:20:40.094
Memorize the beach area,
offshore formations...

01:20:40.131 --> 01:20:42.073
the depth, that sort of thing.

01:20:42.115 --> 01:20:43.424
You got it.

01:21:02.467 --> 01:21:04.409
You really expect
this kind of action?

01:21:04.451 --> 01:21:07.386
You begin to lose odds
out in the open like this.

01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:08.801
You straight on everything?

01:21:09.634 --> 01:21:11.325
Where does our man sleep?

01:21:11.363 --> 01:21:13.850
Forward bunk, starboard.

01:21:13.891 --> 01:21:15.233
His friend?

01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:17.601
-Aft, starboard.
-Engine hatch?

01:21:17.635 --> 01:21:20.155
About four feet aft
of the bridge.

01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:29.726
Let's go.
It'll be light soon.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:32.769
It's a setup.

01:22:49.602 --> 01:22:51.009
Duck!

01:23:02.371 --> 01:23:03.799
Speed boats.

01:23:03.843 --> 01:23:06.395
-How can they know?
-Give me that.

01:24:28.259 --> 01:24:30.331
Those friends of yours?

01:24:31.618 --> 01:24:33.178
Come on, man,
what the hell is going on?

01:24:33.219 --> 01:24:34.975
They were sent
by the people I work for.

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:36.187
Explain.

01:24:36.226 --> 01:24:39.357
When I brought you in,
I didn't check with 'em.

01:24:39.394 --> 01:24:41.369
I broke a rule.

01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:44.891
That was fast of you
back there. Thanks.

01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:46.622
How long till she goes?

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:52.440
Just about...now.

01:25:07.075 --> 01:25:08.351
Marcello, Cergei.

01:25:36.066 --> 01:25:39.230
They're very thorough.
You drive.

01:26:58.946 --> 01:27:01.947
Hey, man, this is getting
just a little bit hairy.

01:27:01.986 --> 01:27:04.255
Yeah. I'm gonna try something.

01:27:25.603 --> 01:27:27.741
That ought to take care of 'em.

01:27:27.778 --> 01:27:31.226
One of 'em had a walkie-talkie.
He was in contact with somebody.

01:27:32.995 --> 01:27:34.882
There they are.
It's a road block.

01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:36.092
Slow down.

01:27:39.907 --> 01:27:41.368
When you're about
200 feet from them...

01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:43.450
put it in first
like you're going to stop...

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:44.767
but keep it rolling.

01:27:44.802 --> 01:27:46.875
Wedge this
against the gas pedal.

01:27:54.306 --> 01:27:56.346
Jump when I say so.

01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:14.458
All right,
jam it on the gas pedal now.

01:28:15.491 --> 01:28:17.313
All right. Ready, jump!

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:41.182
I'm empty.

01:29:42.178 --> 01:29:44.731
Same here.
What do we do now?

01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:47.105
Our friend back there
has picked up a machine gun.

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:11.229
Hey, pick it up and let's go.

01:31:13.282 --> 01:31:17.210
You might not get back
for another ten years.

01:31:48.226 --> 01:31:50.527
This really is a beautiful city.

01:31:53.569 --> 01:31:56.439
What the hell. Let's go.

01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:10.017
Brucine.

01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:16.250
You'll be dead in a few minutes.

01:32:21.346 --> 01:32:23.485
Listen,
you'll really appreciate this.

01:32:23.522 --> 01:32:27.548
This stuff is absolutely clear
when it's in solution.

01:32:27.586 --> 01:32:29.528
I just coated the inside
of the glass with it...

01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:31.261
and let it dry.

01:32:31.298 --> 01:32:33.186
And when the wine hit it...

01:32:33.218 --> 01:32:36.830
it went right back
into solution--no trace.

01:32:39.105 --> 01:32:42.237
Looks just like a heart attack.

01:32:43.522 --> 01:32:46.751
You said every man
has his jelly spot.

01:32:46.786 --> 01:32:50.812
Yours was you just
couldn't cut it alone.

01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:55.962
Was it because of your father?

01:32:57.410 --> 01:33:00.606
You killed him?
I thought he just died.

01:33:03.618 --> 01:33:06.105
You see? There you are.

01:33:07.458 --> 01:33:10.491
They told you who to hit.

01:33:10.529 --> 01:33:14.141
It kept the whole idea from
being what we talked about.

01:33:14.178 --> 01:33:18.334
You needed a license.
Their license.

01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:26.013
I'm gonna pick my own mark.

01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:29.944
Hit when I want.
Just like you said.

01:33:32.098 --> 01:33:34.618
Standing outside.

01:33:45.697 --> 01:33:47.770
See Naples and die.

01:35:19.425 --> 01:35:21.792
"Steve, if you read this,
it means I didn't make it back.

01:35:21.826 --> 01:35:23.484
"It also means
you've broken a filament...

01:35:23.521 --> 01:35:26.489
"controlling a thirteen-second
delay trigger.

01:35:26.530 --> 01:35:27.741
"End of game.

01:35:27.778 --> 01:35:29.054
"Bang. You're dead."
