WEBVTT

00:00.739 --> 00:02.173
<i>Previously on Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.174 --> 00:03.541
How about today we save two
for the price of one?

00:03.542 --> 00:06.372
You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:06.373 --> 00:08.150
To save some kid off the street.
I made a judgment call.

00:08.151 --> 00:09.787
- You made a mistake.
- This trip is gonna get you

00:09.788 --> 00:11.856
Back on your feet.
What trip?

00:11.857 --> 00:13.558
To the Hamptons.

00:13.559 --> 00:16.044
- Boris Kuester
Von Jurgens-Ratenicz.

00:16.045 --> 00:17.575
Stay in my guest cottage
for the summer.

00:17.576 --> 00:19.387
Be my concierge doctor.

00:19.388 --> 00:21.174
Concierge doctor to the rich

00:21.175 --> 00:23.736
And an on-call doctor
to the rest of us.

00:23.737 --> 00:25.501
A Robin hood of medicine.
Apparently the check

00:25.502 --> 00:27.335
You wrote them
for our new portable EKG machine

00:27.336 --> 00:28.868
Just bounced.
What's up?

00:28.869 --> 00:30.736
- We're broke.
- What do you mean, broke?

00:30.737 --> 00:32.569
- We got scammed.
- By who?

00:32.570 --> 00:35.603
I can't believe
you didn't tell me

00:35.604 --> 00:37.703
That dad took all our money.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.270
All right, so it took
a little longer than I thought.

00:40.271 --> 00:42.204
It's still the same shade
of green.

00:48.510 --> 00:56.513
**

00:56.514 --> 00:59.573
Ow. Ow.

00:59.574 --> 01:01.341
Some right you got there,
Hank, huh?

01:01.342 --> 01:02.774
I would know.

01:02.775 --> 01:04.075
Oh, yeah, you look

01:04.075 --> 01:05.176
Like the real
barroom brawl type.

01:05.177 --> 01:06.676
Yeah, looks can be deceiving.

01:10.646 --> 01:14.380
Okay.
All done, rocky.

01:17.082 --> 01:20.249
The setup you've got here
is just amazing.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.017
Look at this.
My sons, huh?

01:22.018 --> 01:23.751
One's a doctor.
One's a businessman.

01:23.752 --> 01:25.319
You're working together.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.353
This is too much.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.987
I mean, I remember

01:27.988 --> 01:29.521
When you were still
little pishers.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.088
You need directions
to the highway?

01:31.089 --> 01:33.256
Look, I understand
about the check, okay.

01:33.257 --> 01:34.757
It didn't cover
the whole thing.

01:34.758 --> 01:36.258
But you know
that I'm still good for it.

01:36.259 --> 01:37.558
We know
you're good for it, dad.

01:37.559 --> 01:38.592
Oh, yeah, he's good for it.

01:38.593 --> 01:40.827
Come on. Hank!

01:40.828 --> 01:42.828
You know, Hank,

01:42.829 --> 01:44.829
I've had a pain in my heart
for 20 years

01:44.830 --> 01:47.031
Since the last time I saw you.

01:47.032 --> 01:51.200
Today, first time, it's gone.

01:51.201 --> 01:53.001
Drive safe.

01:58.940 --> 02:00.173
What was that?
You all right?

02:00.174 --> 02:01.740
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:01.741 --> 02:03.842
Okay, stop, are your eyes
sensitive to the light?

02:03.843 --> 02:06.511
- Well, it's a little glare-y.

02:06.512 --> 02:07.578
It's a sign of a concussion.

02:07.579 --> 02:09.213
Okay, that's it.

02:09.214 --> 02:11.048
You're not driving
with a concussion, dad.

02:11.049 --> 02:12.749
We're not gonna let him drive
with a concussion, right?

02:12.750 --> 02:14.083
Doctor?

02:14.084 --> 02:15.684
I'll get some Tylenol

02:15.685 --> 02:18.619
And a blanket.

02:18.620 --> 02:19.920
Can you walk?

02:19.921 --> 02:22.355
Huh? Yeah.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074

03:02.916 --> 03:05.917
Oh, God.

03:12.223 --> 03:14.323
Evan!

03:18.327 --> 03:22.129
Oh, my God.
They're here?

03:22.130 --> 03:23.763
They sure are.

03:23.764 --> 03:24.931
What is it?

03:24.932 --> 03:27.799
It's opportunity, Hank.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.734
Souvenirs.
Yes.

03:29.735 --> 03:31.269
People are gonna see this,

03:31.270 --> 03:33.304
And they're gonna think
Dr. Hank Lawson.

03:33.305 --> 03:34.304
No, they'll wonder
if I'm a physician

03:34.305 --> 03:35.772
Or batting cleanup.

03:35.773 --> 03:37.107
[mimicking]
no, they're gonna wonder

03:37.108 --> 03:38.274
If I'm a physician
or batting cleanup.

03:38.275 --> 03:39.976
- You're not funny.
- So good.

03:39.977 --> 03:40.977
Why are we spending money
we don't have

03:40.978 --> 03:42.345
On merchandise nobody needs?

03:42.346 --> 03:44.180
I ordered them
before the incident, okay.

03:44.181 --> 03:46.182
I would return them.
They're customized.

03:46.183 --> 03:47.583
What do you want me to do?
It's a good business move.

03:47.584 --> 03:49.218
Where's Eddie r.?

03:49.219 --> 03:51.753
- Who knows?
- He just--he took off?

03:51.754 --> 03:55.056
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll call in 20 years.

03:55.057 --> 03:56.790
Eddie r. Will be back,
okay.

03:56.791 --> 03:58.657
Not that I'm keeping score
or anything,

03:58.658 --> 04:00.257
But back at the Waldorf,
you also said

04:00.258 --> 04:01.724
He wasn't coming back,
but then he came back,

04:01.725 --> 04:03.325
So let the record show
that you were wrong.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.559
The record will reflect that.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.960
Get ready.
We got to go.

04:05.961 --> 04:07.628
So awesome.

04:07.629 --> 04:08.896
I'm thirsty.

04:08.897 --> 04:10.063
[clinking]

04:22.847 --> 04:24.514
Why are we here?

04:24.515 --> 04:25.982
To welcome back
Ms. Newberg's stepdaughter.

04:25.983 --> 04:27.083
- Where was she?
- I don't know.

04:27.084 --> 04:28.484
- Who is she?
- No idea.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.085
- So why are we here?
- Out of respect.

04:30.086 --> 04:31.520
Ms. Newberg's
one of our top clients.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.088
And given
our current predicament,

04:33.089 --> 04:34.922
Financially, we can't afford

04:34.923 --> 04:36.690
To pass up any opportunity
to drum up business.

04:36.691 --> 04:37.992
Know what I mean?

04:37.993 --> 04:41.294
I'll catch up with you later.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.100
Hello, Ms. Newberg.

04:48.101 --> 04:49.301
Ms. Casey.

04:49.302 --> 04:50.768
Hello, Dr. Lawson.

04:50.769 --> 04:52.936
- Congratulations on
the homecoming of your--

04:52.937 --> 04:54.437
- Save it, Hank.

04:54.438 --> 04:55.939
She didn't come home?

04:55.940 --> 04:57.608
She came home, all right.

04:57.609 --> 05:00.611
She was supposed to come home
from Lyon, France,

05:00.612 --> 05:02.212
Where she was supposed
to be finishing

05:02.213 --> 05:04.514
At a very prestigious
cooking school.

05:04.515 --> 05:06.616
Turns out she had met
an American guy in France,

05:06.617 --> 05:09.719
Quit cooking school, and
followed him to San Francisco,

05:09.720 --> 05:11.253
Where he teaches yoga.

05:11.254 --> 05:13.722
We do not approve.
Mm.

05:13.723 --> 05:15.223
I've heard this story
three times.

05:15.224 --> 05:17.158
- Got it.
- I thought she was going

05:17.159 --> 05:18.727
To come home a confectioner.

05:18.728 --> 05:20.395
Instead, she's doing
downward-facing dog

05:20.396 --> 05:21.963
In my living room with a man

05:21.964 --> 05:23.197
Who wears athletic shorts
for a living.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.666
Jill, why can't Blake find

05:25.667 --> 05:27.467
A nice, young doctor
like you did?

05:27.468 --> 05:29.669
Oh, uh...

05:29.670 --> 05:31.904
Well, we're not together
anymore.

05:31.905 --> 05:33.906
You're single?
Perfect.

05:33.907 --> 05:35.607
Blake, there's someone
I want you to meet.

05:35.608 --> 05:38.743
- Oh, doesn't Blake have a--
- Blake, this is Hank.

05:38.744 --> 05:40.278
Hank is my doctor.

05:40.279 --> 05:42.013
Tutu, not again.

05:42.014 --> 05:43.780
And he's single.
Right, Jill?

05:43.781 --> 05:46.616
Uh, yeah.

05:46.617 --> 05:47.684
It's nice to meet you.

05:47.685 --> 05:49.418
This is my boyfriend Jamie.

05:49.419 --> 05:50.953
- Oh, yeah, I wasn't--
- It's okay.

05:50.954 --> 05:52.487
You are the third single man

05:52.488 --> 05:54.089
Ms. Newberg
has introduced Blake to.

05:54.090 --> 05:55.957
Apparently,
I haven't made the cut.

05:55.958 --> 05:58.425
Tell him what you do, Jamie.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.494
Well, aside from loving Blake,

06:00.495 --> 06:01.795
I teach yoga.

06:01.796 --> 06:02.929
Stop being so humble.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.264
He owns six yoga studios

06:05.265 --> 06:07.032
Throughout Northern California,

06:07.033 --> 06:08.600
Not to mention
that he writes a blog

06:08.601 --> 06:10.668
And travels the world
promoting wellness.

06:10.669 --> 06:12.203
I have no idea what that means.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.537
Tutu's been doing this

06:13.538 --> 06:15.139
Since I got out of college.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.606
If a man isn't a lawyer,
a doctor, or a banker,

06:16.607 --> 06:18.008
Then he isn't
worth considering.

06:18.009 --> 06:19.275
And since I married all three,

06:19.276 --> 06:21.311
Tutu would know.

06:21.312 --> 06:23.979
I'm sorry, guys.
Tutu?

06:23.980 --> 06:26.448
I married her father
when she was just a year old.

06:26.449 --> 06:28.516
So I was her second mother
and she called me two.

06:28.517 --> 06:30.284
For some reason
I kept repeating it,

06:30.285 --> 06:31.452
And it became tutu.

06:31.453 --> 06:34.188
And then it stuck.

06:36.290 --> 06:39.558
She really is giving
this marrying raj thing 100%.

06:39.559 --> 06:41.160
Yeah, nothing says commitment

06:41.161 --> 06:43.395
Like feeding another human being
shellfish in public.

06:43.396 --> 06:45.497
[gasps]

06:45.498 --> 06:47.399
And I thought
it was free bat day.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.567
This...

06:48.568 --> 06:49.968
- Oh, God.
- Is awesome.

06:49.969 --> 06:52.971
I know.
Just look at this!

06:52.972 --> 06:54.505
It's subliminal.

06:54.506 --> 06:57.007
I don't think you know
what subliminal means.

06:57.008 --> 06:59.176
It's just good advertising.

06:59.177 --> 07:01.278
I put a HankMed head
on every third table.

07:01.279 --> 07:02.913
- HankMed head?
- Yeah.

07:02.914 --> 07:04.080
Oh, this just keeps
getting better.

07:04.081 --> 07:05.915
It's catchy, right?
HankMed head.

07:05.916 --> 07:07.817
Okay. Pick up and destroy
every one of 'em.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.152
- Come on, look how cute--
- Every one.

07:10.153 --> 07:11.353
Now.

07:11.354 --> 07:13.822
Go.
Wait, no.

07:13.823 --> 07:17.425
This HankMed head would sell
for a fortune

07:17.426 --> 07:19.027
At my yard sale.

07:19.028 --> 07:20.795
But then again,
how do you put a price

07:20.796 --> 07:22.830
On something like this?
You're having a yard sale?

07:22.831 --> 07:24.531
Well, technically,
it's a sell everything

07:24.532 --> 07:27.434
That Charlie every owned,
touched, or gave me sale,

07:27.435 --> 07:30.203
But that was too tricky
to put on a sign.

07:30.204 --> 07:31.871
Those are brutal.
Do you have help?

07:31.872 --> 07:33.640
Well, no,

07:33.641 --> 07:35.942
Not yet, but I'll manage.

07:38.478 --> 07:42.447
If you need
an extra pair of hands,

07:42.448 --> 07:44.883
We could do--yeah.
- Yeah.

07:44.884 --> 07:46.850
It's Blake.
She's in trouble.

07:48.286 --> 07:50.186

08:33.844 --> 08:36.145
All right,
tell me exactly what happened.

08:36.145 --> 08:41.049
- Well, we were--
we had been--

08:41.049 --> 08:42.717
- This is my fault.
I had Blake doing

08:42.717 --> 08:46.320
An advanced pose
and got carried away.

08:46.321 --> 08:48.055
So you two were doing yoga
in the middle of your party?

08:48.056 --> 08:50.724
You have to understand.
Blake hates parties.

08:50.725 --> 08:52.158
I hate being the center
of attention.

08:52.159 --> 08:53.926
I hate being the center
of anything.

08:53.927 --> 08:55.494
Tutu wanted this.

08:55.495 --> 08:58.195
She'll find any excuse
to throw a party.

08:58.196 --> 08:59.596
Like, it's Tuesday.

08:59.597 --> 09:01.264
So you were doing yoga.

09:01.265 --> 09:04.066
It started out as yoga.

09:04.067 --> 09:08.472
But with the sound
of the ocean and the sea air

09:08.473 --> 09:11.207
And Blake being so beautiful...

09:11.208 --> 09:14.343
You weren't doing any type
of drugs to heighten the yoga?

09:14.344 --> 09:17.545
No way.
Yoga is our drug.

09:17.546 --> 09:19.280
Mm. Okay.

09:19.281 --> 09:20.815
I'm really feeling much better.

09:20.816 --> 09:22.783
And we took the red-eye,

09:22.784 --> 09:25.118
And with the heat,
I think I just need some rest

09:25.119 --> 09:27.953
And get my dignity back,
if that's possible.

09:27.954 --> 09:29.555
[laughs] all right, well, look,

09:29.556 --> 09:31.724
We'll do a follow-up
tomorrow morning.

09:31.725 --> 09:33.058
Today, take it easy.

09:33.059 --> 09:35.893
No more yoga
or anything strenuous.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.398
Would it be inappropriate
to ask

09:43.399 --> 09:46.567
How much for the two
right-handed boxing gloves?

09:46.568 --> 09:49.303
Wow. Is there anything
you're not selling?

09:49.304 --> 09:51.073
Oh, this is just Charlie's.

09:51.074 --> 09:53.576
There are twice as many boxes in
the basement full of my stuff.

09:53.577 --> 09:57.013
And they're not gonna carry
themselves out, doctor.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.647
Although I wish they would.

09:58.648 --> 10:00.214
I know it's a pain.

10:00.215 --> 10:02.349
I can't thank you guys enough.

10:02.350 --> 10:03.917
I have too much crap.

10:03.918 --> 10:05.819
In my house, in my life.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.554
Time to simplify.

10:07.555 --> 10:09.822
Are these part
of Jill's yard sale too?

10:09.823 --> 10:12.491
No, we're neighbors,
and I helped her pack the boxes,

10:12.492 --> 10:14.594
So in return Jill is letting me
hock my goods here.

10:14.595 --> 10:16.729
Oh, that's cool.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.697
Yeah, these belts are nice.
Are they pleather?

10:18.698 --> 10:20.165
Excuse me?

10:20.166 --> 10:21.566
- Like pl--
are they real leather,

10:21.567 --> 10:23.335
Or are they polyester?

10:23.336 --> 10:26.738
Cute. No, everything I make
is genuine animal hide.

10:26.739 --> 10:28.173
- Oh.
- You can go into town

10:28.174 --> 10:29.174
And find a belt of less quality

10:29.175 --> 10:30.643
For ten tis the amount.

10:30.644 --> 10:32.344
I sell quality
and affordability.

10:32.345 --> 10:34.179
Cute.
All right.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.114
I am going to take
one of your belts.

10:36.115 --> 10:38.716
In fact, I'm gonna take two.

10:38.717 --> 10:43.152
Two belts.
I'll give you ten bucks.

10:43.153 --> 10:45.888
No? I'll give you $20.
No.

10:45.889 --> 10:47.823
Isn't it traditional
to haggle at a yard sale?

10:47.824 --> 10:49.024
It's not gonna happen.

10:49.025 --> 10:51.660
Wow. You're tough.

10:51.661 --> 10:55.131
Cash okay?

10:55.132 --> 10:57.500
Actually,
I'm Evan r. Lawson.

10:57.501 --> 10:59.602
I'm CFO of HankMed.

10:59.603 --> 11:00.770
Do you think that you could make,

11:00.771 --> 11:02.505
Like, a HankMed wallet for me?

11:02.506 --> 11:04.173
I just think
it would look really cool.

11:04.174 --> 11:05.872
In fact, maybe
we could have coffee later

11:05.873 --> 11:07.206
And discuss product.

11:07.207 --> 11:08.807
Well, I'd have to ask my husband.

11:08.808 --> 11:11.274
Yeah.
Could even be tea if you want.

11:11.275 --> 11:12.841
Quality and affordable tea.

11:12.842 --> 11:14.676
- Everything okay, honey?
- Fine, honey.

11:14.677 --> 11:16.679
This nice man just bought
a couple of my belts

11:16.680 --> 11:18.547
And wants to take me out
for tea.

11:18.548 --> 11:21.617
- This nice man
is also a card-carrying member

11:21.618 --> 11:23.052
Of the police benevolent
association.

11:23.053 --> 11:24.653
I'm also a belt aficionado
and the brother

11:24.654 --> 11:27.390
Of Dr. Hank Lawson,
the renowned doctor.

11:27.391 --> 11:29.325
In fact, there he is.
Hank!

11:29.326 --> 11:31.294
Hey, you want me
to help you out?

11:31.295 --> 11:32.329
Wonderful to meet you,

11:32.330 --> 11:33.697
And I'm loving

11:33.698 --> 11:35.165
What you got going
with the uniform.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.167
You wear it really well.

11:38.669 --> 11:40.203
I've helped enough friends
with yard sales

11:40.204 --> 11:42.138
To know that you only do it

11:42.139 --> 11:44.540
When you've known someone
way too long

11:44.541 --> 11:47.010
Or you owe them big time.

11:47.011 --> 11:50.079
And since neither is the case
with us,

11:50.080 --> 11:52.549
I just want to say thank you.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.717
Well, it's been kind of fun.

11:54.718 --> 11:56.851
Like an anthropological study.

11:56.852 --> 11:59.918
I mean, who knew
Pele actually had waterbeds?

11:59.919 --> 12:01.884
In our entire marriage,
that bed is the only place

12:01.885 --> 12:04.052
Where Charlie and I
were ever really compatible.

12:04.053 --> 12:06.488
Honestly, it's not something
that raj and I

12:06.489 --> 12:09.490
Will be dealing with
until after the wedding.

12:09.491 --> 12:12.793
Bed.
Compatible.

12:12.794 --> 12:14.893
Us.
Wait.

12:14.894 --> 12:16.061
You mean,
you and raj haven't--

12:16.062 --> 12:17.062
- Our culture believes

12:17.063 --> 12:18.130
That a man and a woman

12:18.131 --> 12:19.232
Don't consummate their union

12:19.233 --> 12:21.234
Until after the wedding.

12:21.235 --> 12:24.836
Well, I'm a big fan
of tradition,

12:24.837 --> 12:28.072
But what if the sex
isn't great?

12:28.073 --> 12:29.807
Or even good?

12:29.808 --> 12:32.743
You need to find that out
before you marry raj.

12:36.948 --> 12:39.249
You know, given
how neither here nor there

12:39.250 --> 12:41.017
You and Jill have become,

12:41.018 --> 12:42.919
I really feel like I wasn't
as awkward around her

12:42.920 --> 12:45.255
As I thought I would be.
God, I'm so happy for you.

12:45.256 --> 12:47.924
It's just you guys
have an animal chemistry.

12:47.925 --> 12:49.692
You know that?
Like, it's palpable.

12:49.693 --> 12:50.894
You can smell it.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.995
No, that's those belts

12:51.996 --> 12:53.663
You bought.
[laughs]

12:53.664 --> 12:56.532
[police siren beeps]

12:56.533 --> 12:57.599
What'd you do?

12:57.600 --> 12:58.667
Nothing.

12:58.668 --> 13:00.602
Are you going the speed limit?

13:00.603 --> 13:03.504
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

13:03.505 --> 13:05.839
That's a bum rap.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.374
Oh, my God.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.276
It's that cop.
What cop?

13:09.277 --> 13:10.610
It's the one
who saw me with Sherri.

13:10.611 --> 13:12.245
- Who's Sherri?
- It's his wife.

13:12.246 --> 13:14.013
It was HankMed business.

13:14.014 --> 13:15.347
Okay.

13:15.348 --> 13:16.448
- Hey, officer.
- Hi.

13:16.449 --> 13:18.016
Please step out of the car.

13:18.017 --> 13:20.085
Okay, look, it was just tea.

13:20.086 --> 13:21.352
I swear to God,

13:21.353 --> 13:24.088
Just tea, man.
Not you.

13:24.089 --> 13:26.524
- Okay.
- Him?

13:28.526 --> 13:30.561
Walk to the squad car.

13:53.882 --> 13:55.082
I have a rash.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.384
A rash?

13:57.385 --> 13:59.586
Oh. Okay.

13:59.587 --> 14:02.521
Where?

14:02.522 --> 14:03.622
For my sake,
I hope you practice

14:03.623 --> 14:07.792
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

14:07.793 --> 14:09.226
- Uh-huh.

14:09.227 --> 14:10.627
It started down there
a couple days ago,

14:10.628 --> 14:12.462
And it spread.
It's just getting worse.

14:12.463 --> 14:13.963
All right,
I'll have to do a blood test.

14:13.964 --> 14:15.431
Not at my house, you won't.

14:15.432 --> 14:17.433
I don't want my wife
seeing this.

14:17.434 --> 14:19.601
I've kept it from her
the last couple days.

14:19.602 --> 14:20.869
I don't keep things from her.

14:20.870 --> 14:22.537
Okay, then we'll have to make

14:22.538 --> 14:25.307
An appointment for you
to come to my place.

14:40.223 --> 14:44.091
- Blake, look who's here
for your follow-up!

14:44.092 --> 14:45.459
Hey.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.260
I totally forgot.

14:50.996 --> 14:52.363
Yeah, you know what?

14:52.364 --> 14:54.432
I'm gonna hold your spot
for you.

14:59.537 --> 15:01.504
Have you noticed any pain
or swelling

15:01.505 --> 15:03.371
In your legs?

15:03.372 --> 15:04.607
Crazy soreness.

15:04.608 --> 15:05.976
Nothing that wouldn't come

15:05.977 --> 15:07.644
From a few
of Jamie's yoga classes.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.147
I'm a yoga newbie.

15:09.148 --> 15:11.450
Well, you look
like you're in great shape.

15:11.451 --> 15:12.618
Thanks to Jamie.

15:12.619 --> 15:14.219
But you know what they say.

15:14.220 --> 15:15.919
Being in love is the best diet.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.321
I gave up meat, wine,
cigarettes.

15:18.322 --> 15:20.222
I feel great.
Except for the fact

15:20.223 --> 15:21.890
That you couldn't catch
your breath yesterday

15:21.891 --> 15:23.291
And nearly collapsed.

15:23.292 --> 15:24.658
I told you.

15:24.659 --> 15:26.559
I was tired
and a little overexerted.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.127
It may be overexertion,

15:28.128 --> 15:30.328
But the symptoms you have
line up with cocaine

15:30.329 --> 15:31.663
And other amphetamines.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.697
Hank, I don't do drugs.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.065
Have you been using

15:35.066 --> 15:37.534
Any new creams,
shampoos, or soaps?

15:37.535 --> 15:38.802
It's a thing
my girlfriend gave to me.

15:38.803 --> 15:40.470
It keeps guys attracted to you.

15:40.471 --> 15:42.004
I had a reaction, so I stopped.

15:42.005 --> 15:43.239
A topical pheromone?

15:43.240 --> 15:45.007
You have no idea how hard it is

15:45.008 --> 15:46.341
To date a guy who's younger

15:46.342 --> 15:49.210
And has zero body fat.

15:49.211 --> 15:52.913
Blake, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

15:52.914 --> 15:57.319
Maybe I've taken
some diet pills

15:57.320 --> 16:00.490
To keep my energy up
and my appetite down.

16:00.491 --> 16:02.327
And a sleep aid now and then.

16:02.328 --> 16:05.263
Some anti-anxiety pills
twice a day.

16:07.699 --> 16:09.534
Divya's gonna bring you
a heart monitor.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.102
You'll need to wear it
for the next 24 hours.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.537
It'll let us track

16:12.538 --> 16:14.573
Your heart's activity.
24 hours?

16:14.574 --> 16:15.674
So we can make sure
that you're okay.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.542
Is that a problem?

16:17.543 --> 16:19.744
I guess not.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.247
It's just wrong.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.281
It's not--

16:23.282 --> 16:24.716
People shouldn't be able

16:24.717 --> 16:26.284
To bend around
and check their own backs

16:26.285 --> 16:28.087
For moles.
It's unnatural.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.355
It's--blagh.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.357
Ow.
Hello.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.595
He was about to rent
a room earlier.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.897
He tried to use your name
to get a lower rate.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.632
But then he changed his mind
and left.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.234
The security guard found him.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.568
I don't think he's breathing.

16:43.569 --> 16:44.970
What?

16:44.971 --> 16:46.405
I was going to call the police,

16:46.406 --> 16:47.806
But since you're a doctor.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.607
- Dad.
- Hey!

16:49.608 --> 16:51.042
- Dad!
- Hey!

16:51.043 --> 16:52.210
Oh, my God.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.445
Dad!
Oh, my God.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.214
Here, give me this.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.583
[gasps]

16:58.584 --> 16:59.851
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

16:59.852 --> 17:01.053
Ho! Ho! Ho!
He's moving.

17:01.054 --> 17:04.388
Ho! It's a rental!

17:04.390 --> 17:07.291
Dad, we thought you were dead.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.594
Dead?
How about sleeping?

17:09.595 --> 17:11.530
You know,
you're a heavy sleeper.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.598
Yeah, we practically turned
the car over, pops.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.233
I took an Ambien.

17:16.234 --> 17:17.935
I didn't think
anybody would notice.

17:17.936 --> 17:20.271
It's not very easy
sleeping in your car.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.207
Which raises the question,
what are you doing

17:22.208 --> 17:23.374
Sleeping in a car?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.609
Well, I didn't feel welcome

17:25.611 --> 17:26.944
At your place.

17:26.944 --> 17:30.381
And I made a pact with myself

17:30.382 --> 17:33.250
That I wouldn't spend
another dime of my money

17:33.251 --> 17:35.286
Until I paid my boys back.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.721
And why are you here?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.222
Didn't you have some business

17:38.223 --> 17:40.624
To tend to?
Yes, yes.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.226
But I'm waiting for the rest
of the money to arrive.

17:43.227 --> 17:45.595
It should be here in an hour,
tomorrow at the latest.

17:45.596 --> 17:47.430
- No, no, why are you--
what are you doing here?

17:47.431 --> 17:49.833
'cause I wanted to hand it
to you personally.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.402
Because that worked out so well
yesterday.

17:52.403 --> 17:55.104
[chuckles]

17:55.105 --> 17:56.272
All right, if it's tomorrow,

17:56.273 --> 17:57.273
What are you gonna do tonight?

17:57.274 --> 17:58.441
Where are you gonna sleep?

17:58.442 --> 17:59.442
Are you kidding?

17:59.443 --> 18:00.643
I got an ocean view.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.145
I've got a stereo system.

18:02.146 --> 18:04.414
Because of you,
I got fresh air.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.418
One more night.

18:08.419 --> 18:11.654
Okay, but you show up
after business hours.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.523
And when I wake up,
I don't want muffins or coffee.

18:14.524 --> 18:16.392
I just want you gone.

18:16.393 --> 18:18.661
Okay?
For good.

18:26.093 --> 18:29.059
So, John, I'm not sure
what this rash is

18:29.060 --> 18:30.827
Or where it came from,

18:30.828 --> 18:31.862
But we'll run
a battery of tests

18:31.863 --> 18:33.496
To narrow it down.

18:33.497 --> 18:35.532
Based on the look of it,
I am going to test for an std.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.835
Let's save you the time
and me the money.

18:37.836 --> 18:39.237
I don't cheat.

18:39.238 --> 18:40.405
When we first started dating,

18:40.406 --> 18:42.673
I strayed once.

18:42.674 --> 18:44.675
Sherri almost left me.

18:44.676 --> 18:45.842
I swore I'd never do it again.

18:45.843 --> 18:47.711
And I haven't.

18:47.712 --> 18:48.945
I love my wife.

18:48.946 --> 18:52.649
[cell phone rings]

18:52.650 --> 18:56.686
- Yeah?
- Hey. Bad time?

18:56.687 --> 18:58.355
Sort of.

18:58.356 --> 19:01.291
Okay, I'll be quick.
I've got a favor to ask.

19:01.292 --> 19:04.360
My friend Sherri
from the yard sale,

19:04.361 --> 19:09.299
She has a rash.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.901
Down there.

19:10.902 --> 19:12.971
You think you could stop by
and take a look?

19:12.972 --> 19:15.640
Yeah, sure, I'll be right over.

19:15.641 --> 19:17.842
Okay, great.
Thanks.

19:17.843 --> 19:21.213
Everything okay?

19:21.214 --> 19:23.048
[whispers nervously] yeah.

19:30.390 --> 19:33.392
Guest list is down to 350.

19:33.393 --> 19:34.560
Intimate affair.

19:34.561 --> 19:36.028
Talk to your mum.

19:36.029 --> 19:39.599
She's inviting every
bandyopadhyay on the planet.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.002
I closed with the photographer,

19:42.003 --> 19:44.404
We have a tasting
with the caterer,

19:44.405 --> 19:47.172
And I'd like for us
to talk about,

19:47.173 --> 19:50.275
Uh, well...

19:50.276 --> 19:52.944
Our compatibility.

19:52.945 --> 19:54.879
You would?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.214
Me too.

19:56.215 --> 19:58.249
Really?

19:58.250 --> 20:02.085
Yes, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

20:02.086 --> 20:03.755
You have?

20:03.756 --> 20:07.192
I feel signing a prenup
is good for both of us.

20:07.193 --> 20:08.927
And our families.

20:08.928 --> 20:10.596
A prenup?

20:10.597 --> 20:12.298
I know it's not
the most traditional custom,

20:12.299 --> 20:15.768
But more and more young couples
we know are doing it.

20:15.769 --> 20:18.104
I was about to suggest it
myself.

20:18.105 --> 20:20.239
You were?

20:20.240 --> 20:23.109
Good. I'll have my lawyer
draw one up right away.

20:23.110 --> 20:26.545
Good.

20:38.621 --> 20:40.656
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need a hand there?

20:40.657 --> 20:42.424
You okay?

20:42.425 --> 20:44.159
I'm suffering from a condition

20:44.160 --> 20:46.162
Known as a complete lack
of coordination.

20:46.163 --> 20:47.430
And I've had it since birth.

20:47.431 --> 20:49.031
[laughs]

20:49.032 --> 20:50.366
I'll see if I can find
a treatment for that.

20:50.367 --> 20:51.600
In the meantime,
I need to take a look

20:51.601 --> 20:54.536
At the readouts
from your heart monitor.

20:54.537 --> 20:56.804
You haven't been wearing it.

20:56.805 --> 20:58.672
You've seen me do yoga.

20:58.673 --> 21:00.607
Please don't me me look
any sillier than I already do.

21:00.608 --> 21:02.276
Look, Blake,
I know the monitor's

21:02.277 --> 21:04.245
Not the most fashion-forward
accessory,

21:04.246 --> 21:07.547
But I need you to wear the
halter to rule out arrhythmia.

21:07.548 --> 21:10.283
[sighs]

21:10.284 --> 21:14.553
Does it by any chance
come in sun-kissed yellow?

21:14.554 --> 21:17.723
All right.

21:17.724 --> 21:21.793
I love this kitchen.

21:21.794 --> 21:23.994
Right?

21:23.995 --> 21:26.897
I always knew that you guys
would land on your feet.

21:26.898 --> 21:28.264
'cause that's
what the Lawsons do.

21:28.265 --> 21:29.365
[laughs]

21:29.366 --> 21:30.767
I got to say, right now,

21:30.768 --> 21:32.468
We're feeling
a little on our knees

21:32.469 --> 21:33.602
Because of what happened
with our money.

21:33.603 --> 21:35.104
- Yeah?
- What did happen

21:35.105 --> 21:36.205
With our money by the way?

21:36.206 --> 21:37.372
Are you kidding?

21:37.373 --> 21:39.808
- No.
- Bluesky happened.

21:39.809 --> 21:41.242
The green tech company.

21:41.243 --> 21:43.077
Don't you remember

21:43.078 --> 21:45.479
The low-interest, guaranteed
government loans,

21:45.480 --> 21:47.313
The tax credits?

21:47.314 --> 21:49.082
Are you telling me you forgot?

21:49.083 --> 21:51.717
No, I was talking
about how you went

21:51.718 --> 21:52.785
Into HankMed's bank account

21:52.786 --> 21:54.086
D cleaned it out.

21:54.087 --> 21:56.255
Evan, you gave me the password.

21:56.256 --> 21:58.157
Yeah, for the first wire.

21:58.158 --> 21:59.425
Right?

21:59.426 --> 22:00.426
You told me
the window was closing.

22:00.427 --> 22:01.961
And it did.

22:01.962 --> 22:03.996
I got the inside word
on their ipo.

22:03.997 --> 22:06.097
You didn't tell me
that was all your money.

22:06.098 --> 22:07.999
I thought it was some kind
of investment fund.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.434
I'm pretty sure
I didn't leave out

22:09.435 --> 22:11.169
The "it's all our money" part.

22:11.170 --> 22:12.837
Yeah, well, never mind.

22:12.838 --> 22:14.105
You're gonna get
your money back, day or two.

22:14.106 --> 22:15.473
Week tops.

22:15.474 --> 22:17.608
Okay, so first
it was a few hours.

22:17.609 --> 22:18.609
- Mm-hmm.

22:18.610 --> 22:19.744
Then it was a day or two.

22:19.745 --> 22:21.178
- Right.
- Now it's a week?

22:21.179 --> 22:23.514
Yeah, I know.
My colleague let me down.

22:23.515 --> 22:25.449
Ffft, I lit into him.

22:25.450 --> 22:26.851
Trust me.

22:26.852 --> 22:30.189
- Can I?
- Mm-hmm.

22:30.190 --> 22:33.626
Yes.

22:35.695 --> 22:37.630
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:37.631 --> 22:39.798
- Oh, I got you something.
- You did?

22:39.799 --> 22:41.467
- Mm-hmm.

22:41.468 --> 22:43.936
[imitates whip crack]

22:43.937 --> 22:46.505
See.

22:46.506 --> 22:48.207
- This is beautiful.
- Check it out.

22:48.208 --> 22:49.875
- Oh, you've got the same one.
- Yeah.

22:49.876 --> 22:51.643
Huh?
What is this, alligator?

22:51.644 --> 22:54.480
I don't know.
It's authentic, dead something.

22:54.481 --> 22:56.615
What's that smell?

22:56.616 --> 22:58.617
It's meatloaf a la Lawson.

22:58.618 --> 23:01.120
It's our favorite.
Remember?

23:01.121 --> 23:02.554
Hello, Hank.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.890
Hi.
Could you smoke that outside?

23:04.891 --> 23:07.626
Monte Cristo.
This is cubano.

23:07.627 --> 23:09.694
The real thing.
Where'd you get this?

23:09.695 --> 23:11.062
It was a gift from a patient.

23:11.063 --> 23:12.731
Listen.

23:12.732 --> 23:14.499
I am so glad you're here.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.834
I live here.

23:15.835 --> 23:16.868
Can we talk for a minute?

23:16.869 --> 23:18.403
Love to.

23:18.404 --> 23:21.206
What you did to us back then

23:21.207 --> 23:23.007
Was gutless and pitiful.

23:25.310 --> 23:26.878
I guess the upside is,
by age 15,

23:26.879 --> 23:28.212
I knew exactly the type of man

23:28.213 --> 23:29.647
I would never
let myself become.

23:29.648 --> 23:31.849
I understand
that your life went South

23:31.850 --> 23:34.385
When mom died,
but so did my life.

23:34.386 --> 23:36.186
She was my life.

23:36.187 --> 23:39.255
You didn't leave when mom died.

23:39.256 --> 23:42.324
You took off when she got sick.

23:42.325 --> 23:44.895
You missed the worst part.

23:44.896 --> 23:50.034
You have no idea
what you missed.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.041
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

23:57.042 --> 23:59.310
You're not gonna stay
for dinner?

23:59.311 --> 24:02.213
You know what, I've got
a little business to attend to,

24:02.214 --> 24:03.381
But I'm gonna see you later.

24:03.382 --> 24:07.218
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

24:13.492 --> 24:14.859
[refrigerator door slams]

24:21.066 --> 24:24.836
It's been 20 years.

24:24.837 --> 24:26.071
People can change.

24:26.072 --> 24:29.241
Evan...

24:29.242 --> 24:30.275
You may not remember this,

24:30.276 --> 24:31.877
But after he took off,

24:31.878 --> 24:34.513
You cried every night
for weeks.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.415
You'd fall asleep
by the front door

24:37.416 --> 24:39.451
Just waiting
and waiting and waiting

24:39.452 --> 24:41.219
For him to come walking in.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.520
It's 'cause I loved him.

24:42.521 --> 24:44.689
You loved him.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.423
You worshipped him.

24:46.424 --> 24:48.892
And he loved us.

24:48.893 --> 24:51.762
I don't care if he did
what he did or not.

24:51.763 --> 24:54.631
When he was there,
he was a great father.

24:54.632 --> 24:57.768
I know it sounds weird
to say now,

24:57.769 --> 24:58.769
But you know it.

24:58.770 --> 25:02.906
Forget what he did to us.

25:02.907 --> 25:04.675
Think about what he did to mom.

25:04.676 --> 25:06.977
How could
you ever forgive that?

25:06.978 --> 25:09.146
- It's messed up.
- Yeah.

25:09.147 --> 25:11.248
- He messed up really bad.
- Uh-huh.

25:11.249 --> 25:12.916
- Horrible, right?
- Right.

25:12.917 --> 25:15.718
20 years ago.

25:15.719 --> 25:17.320
And now he's back.

25:17.321 --> 25:18.387
He's in our lives.

25:18.388 --> 25:20.056
Our dad.

25:20.057 --> 25:22.692
And he's sorry.

25:22.693 --> 25:24.160
Yeah, I forgive him.

25:24.161 --> 25:26.095
I do.

25:26.096 --> 25:28.531
At some point, you're gonna have
to forgive him.

25:28.532 --> 25:31.367
At some point, you're gonna
have to realize I won't.

25:47.735 --> 25:49.102
Hello, officer.

25:49.103 --> 25:50.070
I'm Divya Katdare.

25:50.271 --> 25:52.772
I'm Dr. Lawson's
physician assistant.

25:52.773 --> 25:54.807
He'll be right in
with your test results.

25:54.808 --> 25:57.409
Dr. Lawson didn't say
anyone else would be here.

25:57.410 --> 26:00.078
No one else was supposed
to know about this.

26:00.079 --> 26:03.080
Everything between us
is confidential.

26:03.081 --> 26:05.316
- I bet it is.
- Baby, what are you doing here?

26:05.317 --> 26:06.950
Don't you baby me.

26:06.951 --> 26:08.352
You've been acting weird
for days,

26:08.353 --> 26:09.853
So I followed you
when you left for work,

26:09.854 --> 26:12.121
Only you didn't go to work.

26:12.122 --> 26:13.689
You're here with her.

26:13.690 --> 26:16.158
No.
No.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.759
No, no, no, no.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.995
I am not--
not a her.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.196
I'm not here with her.

26:21.197 --> 26:22.263
I'm here because--

26:22.264 --> 26:24.765
Well, because, doc.

26:24.766 --> 26:26.267
Tell Sherri it's nothing.

26:26.268 --> 26:27.768
Dr. Lawson,
why are you here?

26:27.769 --> 26:29.036
How do you know
Dr. Lawson?

26:29.037 --> 26:30.670
How do you know
Dr. Lawson?

26:30.671 --> 26:33.006
Okay, am I free to talk
to you both

26:33.007 --> 26:36.109
About your test results?

26:36.110 --> 26:38.311
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

26:38.312 --> 26:42.015
Okay, you both have rashes,
all right.

26:42.016 --> 26:43.851
And when investigating
a strange rash,

26:43.852 --> 26:46.420
We test for various diseases.

26:46.421 --> 26:49.790
In this case, it is standard
to test for syphilis.

26:49.791 --> 26:54.028
Unfortunately,
your tests came back positive.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.030
- Syphilis?
- It's important

26:56.031 --> 26:57.965
That we contact
all your sexual partners

26:57.966 --> 26:58.633
So they can...

26:58.634 --> 27:00.301
Sexual partners?

27:00.302 --> 27:02.169
What were you doing
while I was in Texas?

27:02.170 --> 27:04.872
What were you doing
while you were in Texas?

27:04.873 --> 27:07.107
I never cheat on you.
You already did it once.

27:07.108 --> 27:09.343
And you kept this rash from me,

27:09.344 --> 27:11.578
So who's to say
what else you're keeping?

27:15.049 --> 27:16.683
There must be some other way
we got this.

27:16.684 --> 27:20.253
I'm sorry.
I wish I had better news.

27:30.932 --> 27:32.766
- Hey.
- Hey, have I got

27:32.767 --> 27:34.534
Good news for you?
Oh, my God.

27:34.535 --> 27:35.535
Just being here is good news.

27:35.536 --> 27:36.968
How did you do this?

27:36.969 --> 27:38.369
I've been trying
to get tee time for weeks.

27:38.370 --> 27:39.469
I know a guy.

27:39.470 --> 27:40.902
Now you see

27:40.903 --> 27:42.936
Those two old-timers
on the first tee?

27:42.937 --> 27:44.504
Yeah, with outfits like that,
how could I miss 'em?

27:44.505 --> 27:46.171
The guy's wearing kilt pants.

27:46.172 --> 27:47.604
No, no, no.
On the golf course,

27:47.605 --> 27:49.171
The louder the clothes,
the deeper the pockets.

27:49.172 --> 27:51.404
Now, the guy with the belly?

27:51.405 --> 27:54.071
He runs a company called
wediagnose.net.

27:54.072 --> 27:56.138
And the other, the wiry one,

27:56.139 --> 27:58.372
He's the president
of a company they call,

27:58.373 --> 28:00.107
And I kid you not,

28:00.108 --> 28:01.808
Cash technologies.

28:01.809 --> 28:04.143
Cash technologies?
That is inspired.

28:04.144 --> 28:06.611
One of them's got
a chronic back problem,

28:06.612 --> 28:07.913
And the other one
has a prostate so big,

28:07.914 --> 28:09.714
He's gotta sleep in a wetsuit.

28:09.715 --> 28:11.916
Two whales waiting
for their Ahab.

28:11.917 --> 28:14.218
And prime HankMed clients,

28:14.219 --> 28:16.286
If we play our cards right.

28:16.287 --> 28:19.422
If we do this together,

28:19.423 --> 28:20.656
What's in it for you?

28:20.657 --> 28:24.159
I'm helping my boys.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.628
I owe you that.

28:26.629 --> 28:29.430
I owe you so much more.

28:29.431 --> 28:31.399
Okay.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.067
All right.

28:33.068 --> 28:35.203
All right,
let's play some golf.

28:35.204 --> 28:36.838
Uh, one problem.

28:36.839 --> 28:39.573
[whispering]
um, I suck at golf.

28:39.574 --> 28:41.342
Exactly.

28:41.343 --> 28:42.709
Get your clubs.

28:50.584 --> 28:52.518
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

28:52.519 --> 28:53.519
What's on the menu?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.120
Smells like--

28:55.121 --> 28:56.788
- Well, it's gluten-free
vegetarian casserole

28:56.789 --> 28:57.989
With soy balls on the side.

28:57.990 --> 29:00.358
That's exactly
what it smells like.

29:00.359 --> 29:02.626
I'm here to take off
your monitor.

29:02.627 --> 29:04.060
Oh, thanks.

29:04.061 --> 29:06.795
<i>If my teachers
Ecole Le Cordon Bleu</i>

29:06.796 --> 29:08.096
Saw this, they'd kick me out,

29:08.097 --> 29:09.530
If I hadn't have quit already.

29:09.531 --> 29:11.164
I like to cook
when I'm stressed.

29:11.165 --> 29:13.032
Mm, I like to eat when
I'm stressed.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.733
I do that too.

29:14.734 --> 29:16.134
[cell phone chimes]
There you go.

29:16.135 --> 29:18.603
Oh, I'm getting
a text from Jamie.

29:18.604 --> 29:19.971
Would you mind?

29:19.972 --> 29:21.773
Uh, sure.

29:21.774 --> 29:25.076
Uh, "my dearest Blake,

29:25.077 --> 29:27.411
"when we met
you were a baking student,

29:27.412 --> 29:29.615
"a carnivore, and a smoker,

29:29.616 --> 29:30.916
"the yin to my Yang.

29:30.917 --> 29:34.186
"now you've become
a yoga aficionado,

29:34.187 --> 29:35.754
"vegan, non-smoker.

29:35.755 --> 29:37.956
"as a result, you've become

29:37.957 --> 29:41.193
The Yang to my Yang."

29:41.194 --> 29:43.428
Go on.

29:43.429 --> 29:46.231
"I feel terrible and am
truly sorry to have to do this,

29:46.232 --> 29:47.532
"but as we all know,

29:47.533 --> 29:50.068
"two yangs can
never survive together.

29:50.069 --> 29:51.903
"I will love you always,

29:51.904 --> 29:53.037
"just not that way.

29:53.038 --> 29:54.572
Namaste."

30:00.479 --> 30:02.413
I am so sorry.

30:02.414 --> 30:05.250
I can't believe
this is happening.

30:06.852 --> 30:09.987
Jamie was my one.

30:09.988 --> 30:12.790
I'm not sure anyone
who breaks up in a text

30:12.791 --> 30:16.060
Could ever be "the one."

30:16.061 --> 30:19.930
Guess who ordered
finger sandwiches.

30:19.931 --> 30:23.000
[sniffling]

30:23.001 --> 30:24.301
Blake.

30:24.302 --> 30:25.969
Tutu.

30:25.970 --> 30:29.505
[crying]

30:29.506 --> 30:31.407
He broke up with me.

30:31.408 --> 30:34.209
I should probably...

30:40.548 --> 30:43.383
Hey, thanks again
for helping me...

30:43.384 --> 30:44.384
Again.

30:44.385 --> 30:45.818
[both laugh]

30:45.819 --> 30:49.221
Hey, that's
what friends are for.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.589
Oh.

30:50.590 --> 30:52.791
Feel good getting rid
of all this stuff?

30:52.792 --> 30:53.892
Yeah.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.593
Yeah.

30:55.594 --> 30:57.461
It's a little scary
getting rid of the clutter.

30:57.462 --> 31:03.333
And there was a lot of clutter.

31:03.334 --> 31:06.168
[bottle caps clatter]

31:08.738 --> 31:12.341
Mm, Sherri kicked him out.

31:12.342 --> 31:13.942
Hmm.

31:13.943 --> 31:16.310
They were the perfect couple.

31:16.311 --> 31:21.082
So perfect, it almost
bordered on unfair.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.317
If they can't make it,

31:23.318 --> 31:26.086
What chance do
the rest of us have?

31:26.087 --> 31:27.321
Which is why it's a good thing

31:27.322 --> 31:29.423
We decided
to just stay friends.

31:29.424 --> 31:31.491
Yeah.

31:31.492 --> 31:33.994
Yeah, it is.

31:33.995 --> 31:35.029
Better that way.

31:35.030 --> 31:36.364
So much better.

31:36.365 --> 31:38.668
Yeah.

31:52.659 --> 31:56.097
[garage door opener whirring]

32:05.274 --> 32:06.408
[cell phone rings]

32:06.409 --> 32:09.311
Hello?

32:09.312 --> 32:10.512
[garage door opener whirring]

32:10.513 --> 32:11.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:11.647 --> 32:13.915
Slow down, Ms. Newberg!

32:13.916 --> 32:15.417
No, listen, listen,

32:15.418 --> 32:17.152
I'll meet you
at Hamptons heritage.

32:17.153 --> 32:18.753
No, no, no.
You have to let the EMTs

32:18.754 --> 32:19.954
Take her to the hospital

32:19.955 --> 32:21.422
If she's having a heart attack.

32:24.989 --> 32:27.057
What's going on?
What is it?

32:27.058 --> 32:28.458
Looks like a heart attack.

32:28.459 --> 32:30.393
Why didn't you let them
take her to Hamptons heritage?

32:30.394 --> 32:32.095
She's bad enough here.

32:32.096 --> 32:33.463
I don't need the hospital
to make it any worse.

32:33.464 --> 32:34.997
No offense.
None taken.

32:34.998 --> 32:36.432
Hank?

32:36.433 --> 32:37.733
Blake, you are
in congestive heart failure,

32:37.734 --> 32:40.268
Which needs immediate attention
in a hospital.

32:40.269 --> 32:42.070
Hank, just let me die.

32:42.071 --> 32:44.538
Please.

32:44.539 --> 32:48.074
All right,
Hamptons heritage it is.

32:48.075 --> 32:49.609
Okay, let's go, let's go.

32:49.610 --> 32:51.544
EKG is consistent
with an anterior wall stemi.

32:51.545 --> 32:52.846
All right, we'll
take it from here.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.380
We'll go to the cath lab,

32:54.381 --> 32:55.682
Get a better look
at her coronary arteries.

32:55.683 --> 32:57.584
We'll figure this out, Blake.

32:57.585 --> 32:59.019
I've got the monitor results.

32:59.020 --> 33:02.356
I need to take a look
at the latest lab tests.

33:02.357 --> 33:05.625
- I'll get that for you.
- Great.

33:05.626 --> 33:06.660
How's she doing?

33:06.661 --> 33:07.861
Not great.

33:10.364 --> 33:12.665
What act of God
got Mrs. Newberg

33:12.666 --> 33:14.934
To set foot in this place?
Motherhood.

33:14.935 --> 33:17.569
Hey, guys, here we go.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.974
That's odd.

33:20.975 --> 33:23.544
Blake's earlier results
are completely clean.

33:23.545 --> 33:26.481
No abnormal activity
in the past 24 hours.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.516
I mean, she seemed fine
when I saw her earlier.

33:28.517 --> 33:29.517
Physically, that is.

33:29.518 --> 33:30.985
What do you mean?

33:30.986 --> 33:32.854
While I was there,
Jamie dumped her...

33:32.855 --> 33:34.789
By text.

33:34.790 --> 33:36.190
Poor thing was so crushed.

33:36.191 --> 33:37.991
How crushed?

33:37.992 --> 33:39.326
Well, heartbroken.

33:39.327 --> 33:41.361
Take me to the cath lab.

33:41.362 --> 33:43.897
Okay.

33:43.898 --> 33:47.333
You aren't having
a heart attack.

33:47.334 --> 33:50.036
I'm not?

33:50.037 --> 33:53.739
Uh, okay, you see
the shape of your heart?

33:53.740 --> 33:54.840
- Uh-huh.

33:54.841 --> 33:56.208
There's apical ballooning

33:56.209 --> 33:58.009
Of the left ventricle,

33:58.010 --> 33:59.844
Which has been
temporarily weakened by stress.

33:59.845 --> 34:02.980
You're experiencing
tako-tsubo syndrome.

34:02.981 --> 34:04.782
Tako what?

34:04.783 --> 34:06.983
It's Japanese
for an octopus trap,

34:06.984 --> 34:10.120
Which is exactly what
your heart looks like right now.

34:10.121 --> 34:12.956
It's usually triggered
by deep emotional stress.

34:12.956 --> 34:14.690
That's my favorite kind.

34:14.692 --> 34:16.125
[laughs]

34:16.126 --> 34:18.327
When the episode
happened at my party,

34:18.328 --> 34:21.730
I was worried about
whether or not tutu liked Jamie.

34:21.731 --> 34:23.732
And then at yoga
when the younger girls

34:23.733 --> 34:25.800
Were flirting with Jamie,

34:25.801 --> 34:28.268
My chest tightened.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.303
And then the text.

34:29.304 --> 34:30.839
- Tako-tsubo is also known

34:30.840 --> 34:32.574
As broken heart syndrome.

34:32.576 --> 34:35.949
It appears Jamie wasn't good
for you or your heart.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.152
Tutu's never gonna let me
live this one down.

34:43.991 --> 34:45.859
I have no desire to get married

34:45.860 --> 34:47.494
While preparing for a divorce.

34:47.495 --> 34:50.931
I know you're
not sure about us.

34:50.931 --> 34:52.331
I wasn't.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.034
I am now.

34:54.034 --> 34:56.002
But if you have any doubts,

34:56.003 --> 34:57.737
Maybe we shouldn't
go through with it.

34:57.738 --> 34:59.272
You were the one
who wanted to talk

34:59.273 --> 35:00.940
About compatibility.

35:00.941 --> 35:04.944
Physical compatibility, raj.

35:04.945 --> 35:06.946
Oh.

35:06.947 --> 35:08.814
Oh!

35:08.815 --> 35:10.317
Ohh.

35:10.318 --> 35:11.820
But I thought
you wanted to wait

35:11.821 --> 35:13.656
Until after our wedding.

35:13.657 --> 35:15.858
I changed my mind.

35:15.859 --> 35:18.760
So you never wanted a prenup.

35:22.298 --> 35:25.367
All I want is this.

35:34.910 --> 35:36.443
Look, we've ruled out

35:36.444 --> 35:37.878
Everything that would give
a false positive

35:37.879 --> 35:39.813
From the fta-abs test.

35:39.814 --> 35:41.448
You think he cheated on her.

35:41.449 --> 35:42.549
Mmm.

35:42.550 --> 35:44.284
I believe him,

35:44.285 --> 35:45.919
And not just because
he's an officer of the law.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.354
I believe the blood test

35:47.355 --> 35:48.855
That showed
they both have syphilis.

35:48.856 --> 35:49.956
I mean, if he did it once...

35:49.957 --> 35:51.625
People can change.

35:51.626 --> 35:53.426
Maybe, but, you know,
some guys have trouble

35:53.427 --> 35:54.828
Staying focused.
Look at Jamie.

35:54.829 --> 35:57.364
And while I respect
your faith in humankind,

35:57.365 --> 36:00.133
We've ruled out lupus,
diabetes mellitus,

36:00.134 --> 36:02.469
Alcoholic cirrhosis,
viral infections.

36:02.470 --> 36:04.405
What else could it be?

36:04.406 --> 36:07.141
HankMed is officially back.

36:07.142 --> 36:10.677
I just signed
two new super-sized clients.

36:10.678 --> 36:11.912
Super-sized.

36:11.913 --> 36:13.413
With dad's help, by the way.

36:13.414 --> 36:15.348
Dad's help?

36:15.349 --> 36:17.083
Whales, Hank.
Like, whales.

36:17.084 --> 36:18.851
Big whales.
Bigger than whales.

36:18.852 --> 36:20.453
What's bigger than a whale?
Nothing.

36:20.454 --> 36:21.721
Whale it is.

36:21.722 --> 36:23.356
Closed them
on a golf course, no less.

36:23.357 --> 36:25.492
<i>- Ah, explains
the caddyshack get-up.</i>

36:25.493 --> 36:26.960
Hey, the louder the clothes,

36:26.961 --> 36:28.061
The deeper the pockets.

36:28.062 --> 36:29.329
Which explains that reptile

36:29.330 --> 36:30.830
You have tied
around your pants.

36:30.831 --> 36:32.231
- The rep--
this is like--

36:32.232 --> 36:33.900
You know how much
this thing cost?

36:33.901 --> 36:35.301
Someone isn't paying you
to wear that?

36:35.302 --> 36:36.636
I bought it
at Jill's yard sale.

36:36.637 --> 36:38.070
Her neighbor makes them.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.540
- Sherri? The cop's wife?
- Mm-hmm.

36:40.541 --> 36:42.141
She tried to sell me a pair

36:42.142 --> 36:43.409
Of the most hideous shoes

36:43.410 --> 36:45.044
Made out of the hide
of some rodent.

36:45.045 --> 36:47.513
Honestly, they looked
like oven mitts with heels.

36:47.514 --> 36:49.215
Did she say what this
was made of?

36:49.216 --> 36:51.951
What? Look, if you're
thinking of calling p.E.T.A.,

36:51.952 --> 36:54.420
It's free-range,
it's organic, it's fine.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.088
Did she mention armadillo?

36:56.089 --> 36:58.490
- No. What are you t--
no.

36:58.491 --> 37:00.058
That would be
a fashion faux pas anyway.

37:00.059 --> 37:02.260
You can't wear armadillo
after Memorial Day...

37:02.261 --> 37:04.029
Or before.

37:04.030 --> 37:07.132
So ever, really.

37:07.133 --> 37:08.801
On it.

37:11.905 --> 37:14.573
Sherri, yesterday
you said you went to Texas.

37:14.574 --> 37:16.175
Can you tell me
what you were doing there?

37:16.176 --> 37:17.609
More like who she was doing.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.579
I work with a hide ranch
outside of Austin.

37:20.580 --> 37:23.248
It's where I get the materials
for my exclusive line.

37:23.249 --> 37:25.117
Are there any armadillos there?

37:25.118 --> 37:28.253
Yes. I'm the only designer
on the entire East coast

37:28.254 --> 37:30.255
Specializing
in armadillo accessories.

37:30.256 --> 37:31.890
It's my shtick.

37:31.891 --> 37:33.525
Have you ever been, uh,
scratched

37:33.526 --> 37:35.861
Or bitten
by one of the armadillos?

37:35.862 --> 37:38.363
Um, just a little nick.
It was nothing.

37:38.364 --> 37:41.733
Okay.
Here's the good news.

37:41.734 --> 37:43.602
I don't think
you have syphilis.

37:43.603 --> 37:45.870
I have to run
some further tests,

37:45.871 --> 37:47.705
But there is a disease
that causes a rash,

37:47.706 --> 37:49.274
Like you both have,

37:49.275 --> 37:52.744
And gives a false positive
on syphilis blood tests.

37:52.745 --> 37:54.579
So then you didn't...

37:54.580 --> 37:57.548
And you didn't.

37:57.549 --> 38:00.218
What you probably have
is called Hansen's disease,

38:00.219 --> 38:02.920
And the only species that
carries it other than us

38:02.921 --> 38:04.455
Is armadillos.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.391
A few weeks of antibiotics

38:06.392 --> 38:08.660
Will clear it up
for the both of you,

38:08.661 --> 38:12.496
Though, legally, we will
have to notify county health.

38:12.497 --> 38:14.098
You said it wasn't serious.

38:14.099 --> 38:16.133
It's not, but Hansen's
has been known in the past

38:16.134 --> 38:17.702
By a different name--

38:17.703 --> 38:19.570
Leprosy.
- Leprosy?

38:19.571 --> 38:20.705
Are you sure we don't
have syphilis?

38:20.706 --> 38:23.007
Yes, and don't worry.

38:23.008 --> 38:24.875
You're not so infectious

38:24.876 --> 38:26.710
That you can't resume
your normal social activities.

38:26.711 --> 38:28.245
It's just the health department

38:28.246 --> 38:30.714
Has defined leprosy
as a reportable disease.

38:30.715 --> 38:32.449
Well, if it isn't
that infectious,

38:32.450 --> 38:34.117
Then how did we get it?

38:34.118 --> 38:36.486
- Prolonged
skin-to-skin contact,

38:36.487 --> 38:37.921
Such as a husband and wife
might have

38:37.922 --> 38:40.157
During intimate moments.

38:40.158 --> 38:42.492
Hansen's
is completely treatable.

38:42.493 --> 38:44.061
You will both be fine.

38:49.801 --> 38:54.438
With the medications
and talk therapy,

38:54.439 --> 38:55.806
You should recover nicely.

38:55.807 --> 38:57.274
Talk therapy?

38:57.275 --> 39:00.911
I don't understand why she
does this to herself.

39:00.912 --> 39:03.580
I made sure she was raised
by the best nannies.

39:03.581 --> 39:06.449
Well, besides myself...

39:06.450 --> 39:07.584
That came out wrong.

39:07.585 --> 39:09.352
No, no, look, it came out fine.

39:09.353 --> 39:11.921
With talk therapy,
there isn't a right or wrong.

39:11.922 --> 39:13.756
Then how do you know
it's working?

39:13.757 --> 39:16.292
Well, hopefully,
when you feel better.

39:16.293 --> 39:18.895
Along with the diuretics
and mild tranquilizers.

39:18.896 --> 39:21.564
Blake, look, I know
there's a lot of stress

39:21.565 --> 39:23.132
In finding the right person,

39:23.133 --> 39:26.002
But you gotta find a way
to take the pressure off.

39:26.003 --> 39:27.670
I try, but every time I do,

39:27.671 --> 39:29.105
Tutu puts it back on.

39:29.106 --> 39:30.406
I just want her to be happy.

39:30.407 --> 39:32.141
Ms. Newberg,

39:32.142 --> 39:34.610
Maybe you should worry
about Blake a little less.

39:34.611 --> 39:36.646
It might be good
for both of you.

39:36.647 --> 39:39.082
I just want my baby to be okay.

39:39.083 --> 39:41.184
I am, tutu.
Thank you.

39:41.185 --> 39:44.688
You may not be
my flesh and blood,

39:44.689 --> 39:45.922
But you're more.

39:45.923 --> 39:47.657
You're my heart.

39:59.454 --> 40:01.854
We've talked a lot
about Hansen's disease.

40:02.155 --> 40:04.956
In the olden
and not-so-olden days,

40:04.957 --> 40:08.025
Misinformation
led to a tragic stigma

40:08.026 --> 40:11.294
Of leprosy.

40:11.295 --> 40:12.763
But if you or someone you love

40:12.964 --> 40:15.332
Has been touched
by Hansen's disease...

40:15.333 --> 40:16.666
We're gonna be late
for newberg.

40:16.667 --> 40:18.068
Hold on one sec.
Just watch this.

40:18.069 --> 40:19.769
So this is
Evan R. Lawson,

40:19.770 --> 40:22.004
CFO of HankMed, saying

40:22.005 --> 40:23.672
Just because you have leprosy

40:23.673 --> 40:29.010
Doesn't mean you have
to be a leper.

40:29.011 --> 40:31.412
I'm afraid to ask.

40:31.413 --> 40:32.847
One of the whales I beached,

40:32.848 --> 40:34.982
He owns, I mean, amongst
a million other things

40:34.983 --> 40:37.284
This site called
wediagnose.net.

40:37.285 --> 40:40.086
It's like the perfect subliminal
marketing crossover.

40:40.087 --> 40:41.287
You really should look that up.

40:41.288 --> 40:42.488
What, subliminal?

40:42.489 --> 40:44.690
Oh, and this is probably

40:44.691 --> 40:46.725
His signed retainer agreement

40:46.726 --> 40:47.993
And a check.

40:47.994 --> 40:49.294
There's a check,

40:49.295 --> 40:52.196
But it's not from the whale.

40:56.134 --> 40:57.934
Dad paid us back.

40:57.935 --> 41:01.304
Every Penny.

41:01.305 --> 41:03.739
How does it feel to be
so consistently wrong?

41:03.740 --> 41:05.007
In this case,

41:05.008 --> 41:08.243
I'm not so sure how it feels.

41:08.244 --> 41:09.844
As much as I'd like
to tape Eddie's check

41:09.845 --> 41:11.211
Over our cash register,

41:11.212 --> 41:12.679
I guess you should deposit it,

41:12.680 --> 41:14.647
After our thank you lunch
with newberg.

41:17.484 --> 41:19.685
Just be nice to Blake,
all right?

41:19.686 --> 41:22.187
When you saved newberg's dog,
we got a Tesla.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.922
You just saved
her step-daughter.

41:23.923 --> 41:25.757
That means we're gonna get,
like, an infinity pool

41:25.758 --> 41:27.125
Or a helicopter or, like, a...

41:27.126 --> 41:28.359
No, a g-5.
We're getting a g-5.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.860
That's what it is.

41:29.861 --> 41:31.662
So you take the girl,
I'll take the jet.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.533
- I don't want the girl.
- I'll take them both then.

41:33.534 --> 41:36.069
Hank? Perfect timing.

41:36.070 --> 41:38.272
Lunch is just being put out.

41:38.273 --> 41:39.607
Allow me.

41:39.608 --> 41:42.243
Oh. Blake called
this morning from Lyon.

41:42.244 --> 41:44.779
She decided to go back
and finish cooking school.

41:44.780 --> 41:46.947
She sounds so happy.

41:46.948 --> 41:48.782
There's no greater joy

41:48.783 --> 41:50.384
Than seeing your child happy.

41:50.385 --> 41:51.985
Every parent deserves that.

41:51.986 --> 41:55.288
And, Hank, I've gotta
say thank you.

41:55.289 --> 41:56.857
Your advice
was very meaningful.

41:56.858 --> 41:57.858
My advice?

41:57.859 --> 41:59.092
Well, after we spoke,

41:59.093 --> 42:00.828
I decided to forget about Blake

42:00.829 --> 42:03.798
And her love life and focus
a little bit more on mine.

42:03.799 --> 42:05.066
So in the last three days,

42:05.067 --> 42:06.801
I found the most wonderful man.

42:10.072 --> 42:11.639
Hello, boys.
