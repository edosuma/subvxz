WEBVTT

00:01.806 --> 00:03.410
What's up, Mar-lunatics?

00:03.411 --> 00:05.045
You know, when it comes to careers

00:05.046 --> 00:07.096
You gotta make sure
you follow your heart.

00:07.097 --> 00:09.884
See, me, I first followed my stomach.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.219
That's right.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.254
I got a job as a pizza delivery boy.

00:13.255 --> 00:15.389
Now, I got fired after two days

00:15.390 --> 00:17.325
because I broke the cardinal rule:

00:17.326 --> 00:20.628
Never eat pie from your own supply.

00:20.629 --> 00:23.579
So eventually I found my true calling:

00:23.580 --> 00:26.015
Making people laugh. Think about it.

00:26.016 --> 00:29.752
I just got paid
to talk about getting paid.

00:29.753 --> 00:32.021
Huh. I just bucked the system.

00:32.022 --> 00:34.824
I just changed the game.
I fought the power.

00:34.825 --> 00:36.726
Hey, DJ, hit the theme song.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

00:46.403 --> 00:47.769
Marlon!

00:49.139 --> 00:53.879
Aw, look at my little man.
So handsome.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.283
Do I really have to
wear this to school?

00:56.284 --> 00:58.517
I can't move my arms.

00:58.518 --> 01:01.937
Let me teach you
a little something, nephew.

01:01.938 --> 01:05.660
Real men wear suits. Mm-kay?

01:05.661 --> 01:08.437
And real ties.

01:08.438 --> 01:10.197
Man, people are gonna make fun of me.

01:10.198 --> 01:13.448
Sweetheart, nobody is gonna
make fun of you.

01:13.449 --> 01:17.917
- What up, fam?
- Oh, damn it.

01:17.918 --> 01:21.472
What in the Men's Wearhouse sale

01:21.473 --> 01:24.249
is this?

01:24.250 --> 01:28.751
Boy, you better give
Joseph A. Banks back his suit.

01:28.752 --> 01:33.387
Why is he dressed like he's
auditioning for a white family?

01:34.034 --> 01:37.758
Is somebody trying to
"Blind Side" you?

01:37.759 --> 01:39.315
What else am I forgetting?

01:39.316 --> 01:41.279
Ooh, uh, why is your son
dressed like a mortician?

01:43.345 --> 01:45.104
No, he look more like a dead body.

01:46.629 --> 01:48.592
He just be sitting in the coffin

01:48.593 --> 01:53.227
and all the old aunties come up
and go, "Mm, he look good.

01:54.552 --> 01:57.090
- "He look good. He was a good"...
- Enough!

01:57.091 --> 01:58.546
Enough.

01:58.547 --> 02:01.289
Zack's school is having a career day,

02:01.290 --> 02:03.015
and the teachers
encouraged all the students

02:03.016 --> 02:06.096
- to dress like a professional.
- Professional what?

02:06.097 --> 02:09.380
Ventriloquist dummy?

02:09.381 --> 02:11.345
You look like you'd be...
should be sitting on my lap

02:11.346 --> 02:12.899
like this, like...

02:15.882 --> 02:18.285
Get off my counter.

02:18.286 --> 02:19.876
- Dad.
- Huh?

02:19.877 --> 02:23.600
Did you notice Yvette's here?

02:23.601 --> 02:26.850
Oh, hey there, ghetto Gollum.

02:26.851 --> 02:32.232
Did you ever find that ring,
my precious?

02:33.589 --> 02:36.941
Okay, come on, guys.
We gotta get going.

02:36.942 --> 02:40.292
Some of us parents have to
go in to discuss our careers.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.357
Ooh, career day, huh?

02:42.358 --> 02:44.084
Who's on the panel?

02:44.085 --> 02:48.180
I mean, I might get inspired.
You know, I'm in between jobs.

02:48.181 --> 02:50.178
Uh, brother.

02:50.179 --> 02:54.817
You, my friend, are in job purgatory.

02:54.818 --> 02:57.086
You just floating
through unemployment like,

02:57.087 --> 03:02.230
"Help me. Help me"

03:03.791 --> 03:07.514
All right, well, the panel consists of

03:07.515 --> 03:10.967
a loan officer,
orthodontist, a paralegal,

03:10.968 --> 03:12.626
and Yvette and I will be joining in

03:12.627 --> 03:14.454
to discuss architecture and design.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.248
Well, now, hold on.

03:16.249 --> 03:18.348
Who's there repping for
the non-traditional careers?

03:18.349 --> 03:21.361
You know, like the DJs
and the bucket drummers

03:21.362 --> 03:23.426
and the statue dude that only move

03:23.427 --> 03:26.945
when you give him a dollar.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.265
Son, are you cool with this?

03:30.266 --> 03:32.297
Man, I just wanna get through this day

03:32.298 --> 03:34.261
and take this suit off.

03:34.262 --> 03:35.582
You gonna be saying that

03:35.583 --> 03:37.985
for the next 40 years, brother.

03:37.986 --> 03:39.373
You see that?

03:39.374 --> 03:41.912
The man is already sticking it to him.

03:41.913 --> 03:44.520
Okay, since Daddy is gonna
rant about "the man,"

03:44.521 --> 03:46.246
Zack and I will be in the car.

03:46.247 --> 03:48.583
All right, hey.
Hey, don't be blinded, sister.

03:48.584 --> 03:50.377
Stay woke.

03:50.378 --> 03:53.356
Marlon, I don't understand
why you're so upset.

03:53.357 --> 03:54.948
The school is just trying to put them

03:54.949 --> 03:56.641
on the right track for success.

03:56.642 --> 03:57.742
Listen to me.

03:58.369 --> 03:59.620
I don't want them
putting my son in a box.

03:59.621 --> 04:02.328
Okay, so you know what?
I don't have time for this

04:02.329 --> 04:06.121
but let's just agree to disagree.

04:06.122 --> 04:08.660
Agree to disagree.

04:08.661 --> 04:11.335
That's what people say
when they know I'm right.

04:11.336 --> 04:13.705
I get it a lot.

04:13.706 --> 04:16.786
And Marlon's going to reveal
his plan in three, two, one...

04:16.786 --> 04:19.934
Stevie. We're gonna crash career day.

04:19.935 --> 04:21.357
What? No way.

04:21.358 --> 04:23.622
I did not see that coming.

04:28.094 --> 04:30.802
So between my architectural degree

04:30.803 --> 04:31.954
and flair for design...

04:31.955 --> 04:35.479
And my business degree
and flair for being fly...

04:35.480 --> 04:37.950
We've managed to sustain

04:37.951 --> 04:41.438
a successful business
for the last nine years!

04:41.439 --> 04:44.417
How's that for a career?

04:49.361 --> 04:52.475
Spoiled rotten bastards.
Pick your head up, Ashley.

04:52.476 --> 04:54.167
We did good.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.335
Thank you, Ms. Brown, Ms. Wayne,

04:56.336 --> 04:58.265
and thank you to all of the parents

04:58.266 --> 05:00.160
who came to talk to us today.

05:02.972 --> 05:06.695
Ah, damn it.

05:06.696 --> 05:10.115
And now, from the PJs of New York,

05:10.116 --> 05:14.008
Standing at 6'3",
6'2" with the hair loss,

05:14.009 --> 05:17.462
social media influencer
and all around dope dude,

05:17.463 --> 05:22.301
Marlon Wayne!

05:45.293 --> 05:47.798
Now, kids.

05:47.799 --> 05:50.473
Please give it up
for your opening acts.

05:52.133 --> 05:54.332
Give it up for the paralegal.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.668
She was too damn lazy
to go to law school.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.528
Now...

06:00.529 --> 06:02.864
traditional jobs are cool...

06:02.865 --> 06:04.219
but...

06:04.220 --> 06:08.112
they take a piece of your soul.

06:08.113 --> 06:13.056
The brutal grind of 9 to 5, every day.

06:13.057 --> 06:16.306
You need a drink after work
to calm you down.

06:16.307 --> 06:19.320
So you go down
to the little watering hole,

06:19.321 --> 06:21.317
and there's a bunch
of miserable people

06:21.318 --> 06:24.906
sitting at the bar
and they drunk and plastered.

06:24.907 --> 06:27.140
And then you go to your bartender,

06:27.141 --> 06:29.138
Bartender Nicky, and she just
gives you the bottle...

06:29.139 --> 06:31.068
She slides it down

06:31.069 --> 06:32.320
and you grab it

06:32.321 --> 06:34.318
and you drink it all the way down

06:34.319 --> 06:39.227
till it makes that "boop" noise
when you put it back down.

06:39.228 --> 06:42.071
And now you're a little intoxicated

06:42.072 --> 06:44.306
and your friend says,
"Hey, you wanna drive?

06:44.307 --> 06:47.150
Let me get your keys."
And you go, "No."

06:47.151 --> 06:50.299
So your friend takes your keys
and she throws them... ching!

06:50.300 --> 06:51.413
Did I say "she"?

06:52.298 --> 06:55.851
Yes, you had your mistress
meet you down there.

06:55.852 --> 06:57.849
So they call you an Uber,

06:57.850 --> 06:59.745
but she don't call you a UberX,

06:59.746 --> 07:01.302
she called you a Uber Pool.

07:01.303 --> 07:04.146
So you sitting in the pool
full of four people

07:04.147 --> 07:07.092
and you drunk and you throw up
on some person's lap.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.988
Meanwhile, some dude is hitting on you

07:08.989 --> 07:10.580
and it gets weird,

07:10.581 --> 07:13.559
and then they push you
out the car on your lawn

07:13.560 --> 07:16.809
and your family don't find you
till the next morning

07:16.810 --> 07:18.875
when they're on the way to school

07:18.876 --> 07:20.737
and the sprinklers are on

07:20.738 --> 07:25.104
and the dog is sniffing your ass.

07:25.105 --> 07:29.201
Is that a life you wanna live? Not me.

07:29.202 --> 07:32.011
I'm here to tell you about

07:32.012 --> 07:34.517
non-traditional jobs.

07:34.518 --> 07:36.819
- Wonderful.
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.087
Why don't you tell us what you do?

07:39.088 --> 07:41.999
Girl, I think different.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.674
Like Steve Jobs.

07:44.675 --> 07:46.908
Martin Luther King Jr.

07:46.909 --> 07:50.328
Jesus Christ.

07:50.329 --> 07:54.391
The little dude
that made up this dance.

07:54.392 --> 07:58.927
You know, we all thunk
outside the box.

07:58.928 --> 08:01.163
You know why? Because nothing good

08:01.164 --> 08:03.499
has ever come out of a box.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.123
What about Playstation?

08:05.124 --> 08:09.388
Hey, man. This ain't a duet.

08:10.779 --> 08:13.046
See, guys, there's a whole world

08:13.047 --> 08:16.939
of alternative careers
just waiting for all of you.

08:16.940 --> 08:20.191
Like a gamer. A magician.

08:20.192 --> 08:21.850
A doula.

08:21.851 --> 08:24.422
Mr. Wayne, I'm confused.

08:24.423 --> 08:26.691
Uh, Stevie told me to say doula.

08:26.692 --> 08:29.535
I don't know
what the hell it is either.

08:29.536 --> 08:32.345
No, I'm just not sure that it's clear

08:32.346 --> 08:35.289
what it is that you actually do.

08:35.291 --> 08:40.638
Oh. I... I follow my heart.

08:41.352 --> 08:45.516
I make people laugh for a living,

08:45.517 --> 08:48.360
and I drive a Range Rover.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.253
With rims and butt-heaters.
My dad is ballin'!

08:52.254 --> 08:54.353
Wonderful. Wonderful.

08:54.354 --> 08:57.535
And I'm sure that
the foundation and structure

08:57.536 --> 09:01.022
that you learned in school
has been very beneficial

09:01.023 --> 09:03.697
to your career.

09:03.698 --> 09:05.864
Nah.

09:05.865 --> 09:07.692
Yeah, you don't need none of that.

09:07.693 --> 09:09.385
Listen, guys, I'm my own boss.

09:09.386 --> 09:11.890
I wake up when I want 'cause this way,

09:11.891 --> 09:13.482
if the dope sneakers come in,

09:13.483 --> 09:16.563
I could be first in line
to get 'em and guess what?

09:16.564 --> 09:18.425
Bow! Got 'em.

09:18.426 --> 09:20.762
You jealous? You should be.

09:20.763 --> 09:22.047
Sneakers also come in a box.

09:22.048 --> 09:23.706
Hey, man, you about to come in a box

09:23.707 --> 09:25.942
- if you keep on interrupting me.
- Mr. Wayne, Mr. Wayne.

09:25.943 --> 09:27.228
Nah, let little boy...

09:27.229 --> 09:28.785
Nah, little boy got something to say.

09:28.786 --> 09:31.054
You got something to say?

09:31.055 --> 09:33.966
All right, so anyway, in summation...

09:33.967 --> 09:37.554
I would like to say to all of you...

09:37.555 --> 09:41.076
I want you all to follow your heart...

09:41.077 --> 09:44.732
and, as God is my witness,

09:44.733 --> 09:50.147
you will never have to work
a day in your life.

09:54.890 --> 09:57.801
Stevie, hit me with that dope outtro.

10:00.951 --> 10:04.606
Sorry, it's my workout playlist.

10:11.819 --> 10:16.795
See, I told you we should
have used some damn music.

10:16.796 --> 10:18.319
- Ooh.
- You killed it, champ.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.587
Your boy did that.

10:20.588 --> 10:22.822
Ah, they couldn't touch me in there.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.056
I dare you to find me one person

10:25.057 --> 10:28.676
that could be mad
at that career day speech.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.601
Found some.

10:40.618 --> 10:42.176
Do they look mad to you?

10:42.177 --> 10:44.342
Perturbed.

10:44.343 --> 10:48.063
This looks like
a meeting of All Lives Matter.

10:49.963 --> 10:52.265
Uh, Ash.

10:52.266 --> 10:54.059
When you hit me to come over

10:54.060 --> 10:58.562
you didn't tell me it was for
the worst swingers party ever.

10:58.563 --> 11:00.782
Ah, man. By the looks of it,

11:00.783 --> 11:02.441
I'm gonna be doing
all the heavy lifting.

11:02.442 --> 11:04.134
All right, let's get to it y'all.

11:04.135 --> 11:05.894
Okay, Marlon.

11:05.895 --> 11:07.317
- Listen.
- Hmm?

11:07.318 --> 11:10.635
Your career day speech
did not go over very well.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.429
Marlon, there are
a lot of white people here,

11:12.430 --> 11:14.562
allow me to translate.

11:14.563 --> 11:16.628
Hey, guys.

11:16.629 --> 11:18.523
Rest assured we've got some Pinkberry

11:18.524 --> 11:22.180
and some charcuterie on the way.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.584
We're gonna
let our dogs inside the house

11:24.585 --> 11:26.751
and we're gonna
let them kiss us on the mouth.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.410
So...

11:28.411 --> 11:33.554
so just rest assured
it's gonna be amaze-balls.

11:34.877 --> 11:36.637
That little speech of yours

11:36.638 --> 11:38.804
has ruined our children's lives.

11:38.805 --> 11:41.140
Tanner wants to be
a street artist now.

11:41.141 --> 11:46.117
Last night, he tagged the gate
in our gated community with...

11:46.118 --> 11:49.638
a pecker.

11:49.639 --> 11:50.823
Aw.

11:50.824 --> 11:53.701
Well, kudos to him for being creative

11:53.702 --> 11:58.405
and kudos to you for
bringing back the word pecker.

11:59.763 --> 12:02.708
Rebecca suddenly believes
she's a designer.

12:02.709 --> 12:07.312
She said I had no swag and then
threw away most of my clothes.

12:07.313 --> 12:10.495
She must have forgot
them khakis you got on.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.357
And them ugly-ass caramel shoes.

12:12.358 --> 12:13.711
They look like someone put some laces

12:13.712 --> 12:16.721
in some Werther's candy.

12:18.756 --> 12:22.412
Marlon. Gabe's mother is concerned

12:22.413 --> 12:24.173
because he's abandoned his dream

12:24.174 --> 12:26.306
- of being a veterinarian.
- Yeah.

12:26.307 --> 12:29.489
He says he's in the rap game now.

12:29.490 --> 12:31.655
♪ Yo, yo, yo, I slung some rocks ♪

12:31.656 --> 12:33.484
♪ And my stacks getting bigger ♪

12:33.485 --> 12:35.650
♪ But life ain't easy
for this 4-foot... ♪

12:35.651 --> 12:38.932
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:42.254 --> 12:43.675
You're gonna go back to that class

12:43.676 --> 12:45.097
and tell them you were wrong.

12:45.098 --> 12:49.563
You gonna take
the bass out your voice.

12:51.158 --> 12:55.929
Don't look at me
for the rest of the night.

13:02.941 --> 13:04.599
Now...

13:04.600 --> 13:06.562
I don't see what the problem is.

13:06.563 --> 13:08.383
The problem is
they all wanna be like you.

13:09.949 --> 13:11.607
Well, congratulations.

13:11.608 --> 13:15.196
Every parent should want
their kid to be like me.

13:15.197 --> 13:18.244
Right, Ash?

13:18.245 --> 13:22.507
Well...

13:24.169 --> 13:26.572
All right. Everybody out.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.943
Come on. Come on, y'all.

13:28.944 --> 13:30.296
Start up them minivans

13:30.297 --> 13:32.057
and let's get the hell up out of here.

13:32.058 --> 13:33.411
Come on.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.240
And, no, you cannot use the bathroom.

13:35.241 --> 13:37.880
You're a grown ass man,
use your kegels.

13:41.369 --> 13:42.824
Marlon, let me explain.

13:42.825 --> 13:44.822
Nah, you don't
have to explain nothing.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.598
Apparently, I ain't nothing.
My daddy ain't nothing.

13:47.599 --> 13:49.798
My granddaddy ain't nothing.

13:49.799 --> 13:51.965
The man who picked
my great-great-granddaddy

13:51.966 --> 13:55.825
from the slave auction,
he ain't nothing.

13:55.826 --> 13:57.789
The porter on the slave ship
that said,

13:57.790 --> 13:59.888
"We got room for one more."
He ain't nothing.

13:59.889 --> 14:02.664
Okay!

14:02.665 --> 14:04.222
Marlon, I didn't say any of that.

14:04.223 --> 14:07.065
I was paraphrasing.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.488
I just don't want Zack

14:08.489 --> 14:10.993
to have the same struggles as us.

14:10.994 --> 14:12.787
Don't you remember
when you were starting

14:12.788 --> 14:16.241
your YouTube career
how hard it was for us?

14:16.242 --> 14:18.949
You left your stable job
at the airport

14:18.950 --> 14:21.184
to make fart videos.

14:21.185 --> 14:25.518
They were trending at the time.

14:25.519 --> 14:27.990
That was really scary for me.

14:27.991 --> 14:29.276
I know but...

14:29.277 --> 14:31.409
remember when I got
that first big check

14:31.410 --> 14:33.474
and we made it rain on those bills?

14:33.475 --> 14:35.811
We was like, "Ah, take that rent.

14:35.812 --> 14:40.652
Ah, on your ass, gas. Ah."

14:40.653 --> 14:42.718
Yeah and then there was a drought

14:42.719 --> 14:44.309
before you got your next check.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.138
It was nine months.

14:46.139 --> 14:47.593
I just don't want our kids

14:47.594 --> 14:49.455
to have that kind of instability

14:49.456 --> 14:52.096
and neither do those parents.

14:52.097 --> 14:56.565
Okay, if it was scary
for you, then why'd you stay?

14:56.566 --> 14:58.867
Because I believed in you...

14:58.868 --> 15:02.220
and I saw how hard you were working.

15:02.221 --> 15:03.608
And...

15:03.609 --> 15:06.620
you don't think
our son will do that too?

15:06.621 --> 15:08.517
Zack, can you come down here a minute?

15:08.518 --> 15:09.973
Why you be bringing
the babies into this?

15:09.974 --> 15:11.426
Damn.

15:13.088 --> 15:14.645
Zack, can you tell your daddy

15:14.646 --> 15:16.541
why you didn't want to do
your homework last night?

15:16.542 --> 15:18.064
My heart doesn't
want to follow fractions.

15:18.065 --> 15:20.909
- I don't need them.
- Yeah, he's right.

15:20.910 --> 15:24.802
3/8 of all the people I know
don't even use fractions.

15:24.803 --> 15:28.256
Zack, can you tell your dad
why you don't need them?

15:28.257 --> 15:31.574
Because I'm gonna be
a famous YouTube star like Dad.

15:31.575 --> 15:35.366
Yeah, I'm never gonna work hard
a day in my life.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.194
Hey, bud, wait...

15:37.195 --> 15:39.260
I never said that.

15:39.261 --> 15:41.392
But that's what Zack heard.

15:41.393 --> 15:45.049
That's what they all heard.

15:45.050 --> 15:47.148
All right, fine.

15:47.149 --> 15:50.398
- I'll fix it.
- Thank you.

15:50.399 --> 15:53.378
But for the record...

15:53.379 --> 15:56.256
I told you
we should stop after Marley.

15:58.423 --> 16:01.199
All right, my little YouTube star.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.095
- Ready to do what daddy does?
- Let's do it.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.093
All right, well,
the first thing we have to do

16:05.094 --> 16:07.564
is we have to have
a brain-storming session.

16:07.565 --> 16:09.392
Okay, that's where
we figure out some ideas.

16:09.393 --> 16:10.916
So what do you got?

16:10.917 --> 16:12.846
I was thinking I'd do
one of my characters.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.636
- Oh, okay.
- You know, this guy.

16:18.365 --> 16:20.904
You know what... this is my bad.

16:20.905 --> 16:23.376
See, there was this one time
when you was a baby

16:23.377 --> 16:25.948
I dropped you five times.

16:25.949 --> 16:27.235
Come on, son.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.063
We gotta think bigger, baby. Come on.

16:29.064 --> 16:30.418
Well, what do you do, Dad?

16:30.419 --> 16:32.483
Well, me, I do "The Marlon Way."

16:32.484 --> 16:35.395
That's where I riff on various topics.

16:35.396 --> 16:37.698
I wanna do a cool version of that.

16:37.699 --> 16:40.542
Says the dude that looks like
a nappy metronome.

16:40.543 --> 16:42.234
Dad, you're doing it wrong, it's...

16:42.235 --> 16:43.825
Welcome to "The Zack Attack",

16:43.826 --> 16:46.906
where Zack attacks things
that everybody hates.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.937
Now, the problem
with mac and cheese is...

16:48.938 --> 16:51.579
Hold up, hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up, hold up,

16:51.580 --> 16:53.780
hold up, hold up.

16:53.781 --> 16:58.248
Are you throwing shade
at mac and cheese?

16:58.249 --> 16:59.773
Why don't you just make a video

16:59.774 --> 17:01.601
of you punching a kitten
in the throat?

17:01.602 --> 17:02.955
Now, come on.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.596
Pick a topic that
the audience can get behind.

17:05.597 --> 17:09.286
The thing about mac and cheese...

17:09.287 --> 17:12.637
- Black Panther.
- All right, now we talking.

17:12.638 --> 17:15.076
- Was overrated.
- Whoa, hey.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.328
Hey, man.

17:16.329 --> 17:17.988
Ain't nobody trying to hear that.

17:17.989 --> 17:21.441
You trying to get us
kicked out the race?

17:21.442 --> 17:23.946
- Natural hair.
- Hey, man.

17:23.948 --> 17:26.282
You trying to get us
beat up by the sisters?

17:26.284 --> 17:28.281
Weaves are our friends.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.244
Weave them alone.

17:30.245 --> 17:32.174
God. Say, Jack.

17:32.175 --> 17:35.288
You trying to get us killed? Sorry.

17:35.289 --> 17:36.880
Beyoncé.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.148
I'd rather you talk about God.

17:41.317 --> 17:44.125
Jay-Z plus Beyoncé.
That's the illuminati.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.206
These Bey-hive people are crazy.

17:49.645 --> 17:52.454
I hear copters.
They flying Solange in.

17:52.455 --> 17:54.077
Ah!

17:59.143 --> 18:01.958
Dad. We've been at this all day.

18:01.959 --> 18:03.657
I tried like a zillion topics

18:03.658 --> 18:05.146
and you shot down every one of them.

18:05.147 --> 18:08.396
Son, I can't have you
out here talking about

18:08.397 --> 18:10.935
Forest Whitaker's eye like that, man.

18:10.936 --> 18:13.441
I mean, geez,
this brother won an Oscar.

18:13.442 --> 18:16.150
Put some respect on his name.

18:16.151 --> 18:18.215
Now, look, son. Okay?

18:18.216 --> 18:21.770
It took me about
ten zillion different topics

18:21.771 --> 18:23.293
before I found one that worked.

18:23.294 --> 18:26.341
So we're just gonna
keep working at it.

18:26.342 --> 18:28.676
- Well, I quit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

18:28.677 --> 18:30.641
Whoa.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.180
We don't quit in this family.

18:33.181 --> 18:35.110
That's a four letter word
we don't say.

18:35.111 --> 18:37.176
We don't say quit
and we don't sat can't.

18:37.177 --> 18:40.426
Everything else is for the taking.

18:40.427 --> 18:42.389
Now, when I started, I couldn't quit.

18:42.390 --> 18:46.622
You know why? Because I had a family.

18:46.623 --> 18:49.599
And I had this
beautiful little baby boy...

18:49.600 --> 18:51.787
who needed expensive formula

18:51.788 --> 18:55.512
because even though he had
perfectly good breast milk...

18:55.513 --> 18:57.713
he couldn't latch on.

18:57.714 --> 19:00.338
Now, you got that
from your mother's side.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.690
Dad, you said that I wouldn't
have to work a day in my life.

19:03.691 --> 19:06.026
Son.

19:06.027 --> 19:08.701
What I meant was...

19:08.702 --> 19:10.563
if you follow your heart...

19:10.564 --> 19:13.137
and you find something
that you love...

19:13.138 --> 19:17.468
it won't feel like work.

19:20.585 --> 19:24.606
And that's all I was trying to
say to you guys the other day.

19:24.607 --> 19:26.884
See, I left you all
with the impression

19:26.885 --> 19:31.791
that non-traditional careers
don't require hard work.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.604
That's not true. But...

19:34.605 --> 19:37.312
if you do something that you love,

19:37.313 --> 19:41.274
it won't feel like work.

19:41.275 --> 19:45.537
So, in closing, I'd like to
say, stay in school...

19:46.895 --> 19:49.467
Stranger danger...

19:49.468 --> 19:54.341
only you can prevent forest fires...

19:56.713 --> 20:01.112
And don't do some drugs.

20:02.842 --> 20:05.380
Anything else? We cool?

20:05.381 --> 20:07.141
Uh, that's the best y'all gonna get.

20:07.142 --> 20:09.139
Mm-hmm.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.560
Thank you.

20:10.561 --> 20:13.506

20:34.692 --> 20:38.656
So did I miss my calling as
a motivational speaker or what?

20:38.657 --> 20:41.128
That or a fireman
who only puts out fires

20:41.129 --> 20:43.747
he started himself.

20:43.748 --> 20:45.406
You know, I realized something.

20:45.407 --> 20:48.962
When I first started
chasing my dreams...

20:48.963 --> 20:51.667
it must have been
really scary for you.

20:53.093 --> 20:55.225
But for me it wasn't.

20:55.226 --> 20:59.187
It was the first time
in my professional life...

20:59.188 --> 21:02.335
that I just felt alive.

21:02.336 --> 21:04.536
And that's what I want for those kids.

21:04.537 --> 21:07.075
And that's what I want for our kids.

21:07.076 --> 21:08.768
I get that.

21:08.769 --> 21:12.493
And for the record, Marlon...

21:12.494 --> 21:16.146
I'd be thrilled
if Zack turned out like you.

21:17.504 --> 21:18.993
- Hey.
- Hmm?

21:18.994 --> 21:21.465
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

21:21.466 --> 21:23.868
Is Miss Frye staring
at my booty right now?

21:23.869 --> 21:27.694
- Marlon.
- Just look.

21:27.695 --> 21:30.166
Actually... yeah, she is.

21:30.167 --> 21:32.333
Girl, I knew it. My ass is hot.
