00:02.080 --> 00:03.741
- Previous/)4”
- Where will ye go, Nephew?

00:03.830 --> 00:05.081
We'll travel west.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.877
Ciaire can practice her heal/77g.
I can find work as a printer.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.628
Marsali would not be well-suited
to a long Journey.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.709
She is with child.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.132
I don ’1‘ want you
to live a ha/ﬁ/ife.

00:14.260 --> 00:16.216
I would lay the world
at your feet, Claire...

00:16.720 --> 00:17.709
but I have nothing to give you.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.477
I've heard there are Indians that will
cut yer heart from yer chest.

00:20.730 --> 00:24.302
Some can be friendly, and some
you'd do well to steer clear of.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.278
It's a silver filling.
He has to be someone like me.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.363
- Will you marry me?
- I'm not ready for this.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.612
If you don't care enough to marry me,

00:37.700 --> 00:39.736
then I don't care enough
to have ye in my bed.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.367
This must be the most
beautiful land I've ever seen.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.281
We’d have to accept
Governor Tryon ’5 offer.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.280
- Do ye trust me, Claire?
- Always.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.746
Sing me a song

00:49.840 --> 00:52.798
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.170 --> 00:55.388
Say, could that lass

00:55.930 --> 00:57.545
Be 1'?

00:58.510 --> 01:00.558
Merry of soul

01:00.890 --> 01:03.597
She saliea’ on a day

01:03.890 --> 01:06.017
Over the sea

01:06.100 --> 01:07.977
7'0 Skye

01:09.020 --> 01:11.568
B/i/ow and breeze

01:11.650 --> 01:13.982
Islands and seas

01:14.150 --> 01:18.063
Mountains of ram and sun

01:19.450 --> 01:21.941
All that was good

01:22.040 --> 01:24.156
All that was fair

01:24.660 --> 01:27.128
All that was me

01:27.210 --> 01:29.030
Is gone

01:29.920 --> 01:32.047
Sing me a song

01:32.130 --> 01:34.667
Of a /ass that is gone

01:34.970 --> 01:37.291
Say, could that /ass

01:37.640 --> 01:39.710
Be 1'?

01:40.390 --> 01:42.517
Merry of soul

01:42.600 --> 01:45.262
She salied on a day

01:45.520 --> 01:49.058
Over the sea

01:49.560 --> 01:55.317
7'o S/(ye

02:33.900 --> 02:36.357
Commendable decision
on your part, Mr Fraser.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.577
One I dinna make lightly,
Your Excellency.

02:43.790 --> 02:47.078
Of course, what with 10,000 acres
of His Majesty's land at your disposal,

02:47.160 --> 02:48.866
a Herculean task lies before you.

02:49.790 --> 02:51.246
A task I welcome, sir.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.205
A chart of your land.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.949
And my secretary can make arrangements

02:56.050 --> 02:58.120
for Mistress Fraser to be
accommodated here at Wilmington

02:58.220 --> 03:00.632
while she awaits establishment
of your new home.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.006
It's generous of you
to consider her, Your Excellency,

03:03.100 --> 03:06.672
but, uh, she intends to accompany me
to help build Fraser's Ridge.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.219
Well then, as you wish.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.108
May God grant you the fortitude
to overcome the hardships

03:12.190 --> 03:14.101
you will undoubtedly face
in the backcountry.

03:14.190 --> 03:15.225
I assure you, sir,

03:15.530 --> 03:17.430
she has a great deal of fortitude.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.139
She's a healer.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.231
She's seen war and plague.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.366
Couldn't do it without her.

03:24.780 --> 03:25.860
Hmm.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.821
You've found good men willing
to settle there also?

03:28.040 --> 03:31.498
I have my best man in Wilmington
putting out the word.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.583
Well, I would encourage you to, uh,
take your time choosing settlers.

03:37.590 --> 03:39.581
It's very difficult to distinguish
friend from foe.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.382
So-called "Regulators"
are stirring up trouble in the Piedmont,

03:42.840 --> 03:44.842
pitching themselves
against my tax collectors.

03:44.930 --> 03:45.919
Brandy?

03:46.720 --> 03:47.709
Aye.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.509
Hmm.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.842
- Aye, there was talk in the taverns.
-Hmm.

03:53.230 --> 03:54.766
Men of shallow understanding,

03:54.860 --> 03:57.181
who believe themselves the sovereign
arbiters of right and wrong.

03:57.690 --> 03:59.817
What is wrong
is their disorderly conduct

03:59.900 --> 04:01.731
and their continued failure
to pay their taxes.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.981
Can your sheriffs not discourage them

04:06.080 --> 04:07.069
from taking matters
into their own hands?

04:07.660 --> 04:09.821
Well, I believe that they too
are exacerbating matters.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.780
Some have proven to be dishonest.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.166
Taxes are not reaching the treasurers.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.416
I see. I'm sorry to hear it.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.211
It's not your sympathy
I want, Mr Fraser.

04:21.670 --> 04:24.548
I meant no... I'm simply grateful.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.723
I gather you have supped
with princes and paupers.

04:33.270 --> 04:34.726
I have, Your Excellency.

04:36.730 --> 04:39.358
It's said that the Highlander has much
in common with the Indian savage.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.849
Do you think it so?

04:42.320 --> 04:46.063
Savagery can exist in many forms,
Your Excellency.

04:47.910 --> 04:50.287
I've witnessed it
in both prince and pauper.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.611
Given your own worldly wisdom,
I'm sure you'll agree that

04:53.710 --> 04:56.281
those that live in defiance
of His Majesty

04:56.380 --> 04:58.029
are no better than barbarians.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.794
And often, the law is not efficient
in containing them.

05:03.590 --> 05:04.579
Aye.

05:05.470 --> 05:09.054
Well, there is the law,
and there is what is done.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.800
Pleased we understand
each other, Mr Fraser.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.306
An agreement with a gentleman
is worth its weight in gold,

05:16.900 --> 05:19.516
especially one who knows the world
and all of its troubles.

05:20.190 --> 05:24.604
Let's hope the world keeps its troubles
to itself, Your Excellency.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.196
I admire your spirit, Mr Fraser.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.770
You're just the type of settler
North Carolina needs.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.751
That's the last of it.

05:43.550 --> 05:46.087
- I'll take those, Auntie.
- Oh, thank you, Ian.

05:50.300 --> 05:54.555
Could I buy some bread, cheese,
salt pork to take with us, please?

05:54.850 --> 05:56.056
Aye.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.511
I had a mind to prepare ye
a basket of provisions,

05:59.400 --> 06:01.220
only the thought of it...

06:02.280 --> 06:03.929
I can barely speak of a supper

06:04.400 --> 06:06.641
without feeling as queasy
as our sa/i on the
Artem/s.

06:07.490 --> 06:10.277
You'll have me singing, "Heave away,
my Johnny, heave away."

06:11.780 --> 06:14.533
You should chew peppermint
if you can find some.

06:15.460 --> 06:19.453
And eat small meals often,
even if you're not hungry.

06:20.790 --> 06:21.779
Hmm.

06:24.460 --> 06:25.461
And what's the matter?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.467
I miss my mother.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.764
I ken ye don't care for her
and that there's bad blood betwixt ye,

06:38.850 --> 06:40.511
but with a bairn coming...

06:42.770 --> 06:44.067
I wish she was here with me.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.738
It's not unusual
to want your mother now.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.441
If there's anything I can do...

06:51.620 --> 06:53.110
That's very kind of ye.

06:53.700 --> 06:58.535
And there is no other healer I'd want
by my side if things were to go wrong.

06:59.790 --> 07:06.127
Only there's delivering a bairn,
and then there's raising one.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.837
Your mother did a fine job raising you.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.762
And I'm sure you'll do just as well.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.767
Hey, I dinna want any settlers
who may cause trouble.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.299
I'll be careful in my selection.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.188
Find Highlanders, if you're able,
and the men from Ardsmuir Prison.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.352
They'll be hereabouts.
Bring as many as are willing.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.849
I'll look for them, Milord.

07:32.990 --> 07:33.979
I, uh...

07:34.490 --> 07:36.572
I trust things are well for you here.

07:37.950 --> 07:39.360
- You have enough money?
- Aye.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.859
You must not worry yourself, Milord.

07:41.370 --> 07:43.782
I've managed some work
and with Marsali's sewing,

07:44.460 --> 07:45.620
we've enough for now.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.626
Well, then, the wagon is loaded.

07:55.430 --> 07:57.807
We will write to you the moment
our bairn arrives.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.181
And we'll have a fine cabin
waiting for you.

08:02.270 --> 08:04.647
Hmm. The three of you can join us.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.526
You have that faraway look
in your eye, Sassenach.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.196
Ah, it's nothing. I just--

08:19.290 --> 08:20.279
Marsali...

08:21.790 --> 08:23.667
She's so radiant with child.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.780
She's almost the same age as Brianna.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.886
Sometimes, I...

08:39.220 --> 08:42.929
Well, I worry
that I was wrong to leave her.

08:44.060 --> 08:46.221
You know, I don't remember
much about my mother.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.392
ButI know I missed her dearly
when I had Bree.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.733
And now I won't be there for her.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.155
Or a grandchild.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.529
When I...

09:02.540 --> 09:03.950
When I was without you,

09:05.040 --> 09:09.409
I held onto thoughts of your face,
your words, your heart.

09:10.340 --> 09:13.798
I clung to those memories
when I didn't want to stand

09:14.760 --> 09:17.217
and I was thankful for them
when I could.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.347
Our daughter will do the same.

10:09.690 --> 10:11.976
You go on, Uncle Jamie. I'll be fine.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.099
Aye.

10:14.820 --> 10:16.640
Dinna like heights that much, eh?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.900
I'll never tire of this view.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.730
If this were a painting,

10:23.700 --> 10:28.160
people would say it wasn't real,
that the artist had imagined it.

10:28.580 --> 10:32.334
Well, we're near enough ye might
speak with God himself,

10:33.880 --> 10:35.336
and compliment him on his brush strokes.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.081
He has a certain touch.

10:49.690 --> 10:50.975
Where now, Auntie?

10:52.320 --> 10:54.390
It's another
100 yards that way.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.269
And then...

10:57.570 --> 10:59.356
Then we have to turn to the south again.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.276
We must have placed 100 posts!

11:03.950 --> 11:05.486
Well, this is ours.

11:06.370 --> 11:07.701
Wondrous, is it not?

11:10.290 --> 11:13.202
"My country, 'tis of thee,

11:14.050 --> 11:15.915
"sweet land of liberty,

11:16.840 --> 11:18.580
"of thee I sing."

11:19.510 --> 11:20.670
Poem from your time?

11:21.680 --> 11:24.808
It's a song called "America."

11:25.510 --> 11:30.095
It has the same melody as
God Save Great George Our King.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.090
You're telling me
the Americans

11:32.190 --> 11:34.181
stole it from King George
and made it their own?

11:34.270 --> 11:36.022
- We did.
- Ah.

11:37.610 --> 11:39.237
Heartily applauded, then.

11:43.490 --> 11:44.616
Sing it for me, Sassenach.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.736
No.

11:49.370 --> 11:50.655
When you sing,

11:51.040 --> 11:53.998
all proper and polite
like you're in church,

11:54.790 --> 11:58.089
I must confess it makes me
wanna do Indecent things.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.371
- Like what?
- Where to begin?

12:02.130 --> 12:04.257
- Well, the beginning is always nice.
- Huh.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.347
Well, maybe I'll press ye up
against my--

12:07.430 --> 12:08.761
Uncle Jamie, come here!

12:15.690 --> 12:18.602
They're witness trees.
Governor Tryon spoke of them.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.197
They mark the farthest boundary
of our land.

12:29.040 --> 12:34.410
This will be a sign to all who pass
that they're entering Fraser's Ridge.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.079
Here.

12:39.630 --> 12:41.666
Oh, Christ.

12:42.170 --> 12:43.546
I wonder
what animal left that.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.790
Maybe a raccoon?

12:45.090 --> 12:46.546
Myers told me of such creatures.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.347
It'd take a whole family of raccoons
to produce that amount.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.426
No, there are much more
dangerous animals

12:51.520 --> 12:52.885
in North Carolina that could claim it.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.549
Wolves?

12:56.190 --> 12:58.010
Certainly none as friendly as Rollo.

13:01.570 --> 13:02.639
Lions?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.276
Try not to look so excited.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.772
But, yes, there are mountain lions,

13:07.870 --> 13:09.485
though they call them panthers
in these parts.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.282
And there are other wild animals...
Bears.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.032
Though it might be a bit late
in the year for them.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.121
They hibernate.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.280
They bed down for winter
and sleep until spring.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.415
Oh.

13:22.470 --> 13:23.710
What's got your hackles up?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.301
Is there something behind us?

13:54.080 --> 13:57.413
Claire, put the knife
in my hand and get behind me.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.210
What do they want, Uncle Jamie?

14:14.060 --> 14:15.425
Suppose we'll find out.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.436
They look like Cherokee.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.766
The ones Myers dealt
with seemed friendly.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.817
- I'll go with you.
- Dinna move a hair.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.528
Both of you, stay by the rifles.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.499
James Fraser.

14:55.810 --> 14:57.300
I am James Fraser.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.045
Why is it that grandmothers
seem to be

15:33.140 --> 15:35.961
in the habit of dying just
when my students have an essay

15:36.060 --> 15:38.631
on the poetry of the First World War
to hand in?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.937
Roger?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.099
Hmm?

15:47.990 --> 15:51.903
Sorry, Peter.
I'm a bit distracted and busy.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.657
Well, old chap,
if you foresee an opening

15:54.740 --> 15:56.401
in that chaotic diary of yours,

15:56.490 --> 15:59.243
then join us for a scotch and a smoke.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.450
-Mmm.
- Be like old times.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.339
”Mount He/icon,
now known as Grandfather Mountain,

16:48.800 --> 16:51.712
”settled in the 17705 by H/gh/and Scots.

16:55.470 --> 16:58.132
”One nearby settlement
cal/ed Fraser’s Ridge

16:58.220 --> 16:59.767
’,’oro vides yet another example

16:59.850 --> 17:01.977
. ”of a Scottish name
In the surround/ng area. ”

17:11.490 --> 17:12.479
Good boy.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.959
"Fraser's Ridge"?

17:53.490 --> 17:55.560
Is that a cabin I see before me?

17:57.820 --> 17:58.900
It will be, aye.

17:59.530 --> 18:03.944
Unless you want to live under moss
and grass for the rest of your days.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.280
The front door, I presume?

18:07.580 --> 18:10.242
Aye, facing south.

18:12.170 --> 18:13.956
Catch the winter sun.

18:16.380 --> 18:17.881
- What will that be there?
-Hmm.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.637
That will be a shed for meat.

18:22.430 --> 18:25.388
We'll dig a shallow pit at the back,

18:25.480 --> 18:28.142
fill it with embers
to smoke what we can.

18:28.810 --> 18:30.721
Then we'll make a rack for drying.

18:31.270 --> 18:33.226
Myers calls it "jerked" meat.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.521
We called it "jerlq" in Boston

18:37.240 --> 18:39.196
and it's damn delicious.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.326
Ian tied our stores up.

18:41.450 --> 18:42.781
What meat we have will be kept there,

18:42.870 --> 18:45.361
away from animals,
till the shed's built.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.030
What will this be?

18:53.130 --> 18:54.119
Well, this...

18:54.710 --> 18:59.329
This will be your wee shed, Sassenach,
for your herbs

18:59.970 --> 19:02.757
and physician's knives and such.

19:03.890 --> 19:07.098
And when we have settlers,
you can bring patients here,

19:08.640 --> 19:09.641
if you wish.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.220
- You've thought of everything.
-Hmm.

19:16.070 --> 19:18.641
Christ, the pole's crooked.

19:20.780 --> 19:24.193
The shed will be too.
I canna have a crooked shed.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.867
I hardly think
the deer carcasses will mind.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.240
Uncle Jamie!

19:30.710 --> 19:31.779
Uncle Jamie!

19:32.840 --> 19:33.829
They've returned.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.541
Get behind me.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.319
Oh, my God.

21:13.980 --> 21:16.096
- Hello?
- Br/anna?

21:17.060 --> 21:18.971
- Roger?
- Who is it?

21:19.690 --> 21:23.444
- Is it too early? Did I wake you?
- No, no, not at all. I'm up.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.566
Gayle and I were just gonna head
to a rally in the Common.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.019
Roger?

21:30.450 --> 21:31.656
Oh, my...

21:35.210 --> 21:37.030
How, uh, how are you?

21:37.630 --> 21:38.915
Is everything okay?

21:39.630 --> 21:42.508
Aye, aye. I'm well. And you?

21:43.720 --> 21:47.759
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
Just busy with school and all.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.131
I was just thinking about you.

21:56.850 --> 21:57.839
You were?

21:59.150 --> 22:00.139
Yeah.

22:01.110 --> 22:05.888
Just... wondering
if you had a nice holiday.

22:09.030 --> 22:12.659
Actually, it's next week,
but it's not really a holiday.

22:12.740 --> 22:15.789
I'm just heading up to Inverness to get
the last of the boxes from the house.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.458
Fiona was kind enough
to store them for me.

22:21.380 --> 22:22.449
I, uh...

22:24.050 --> 22:25.039
Bnanna”.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.832
I have some news about your mother.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.097
- My mother?
-Aye.

22:31.930 --> 22:34.216
Remember the wee book
you gave me at the festival?

22:34.980 --> 22:38.438
Well, I was fl/pp/ng through it
and I saw a line...

22:38.560 --> 22:43.020
A single mention, really,
about a place called Fraser's Ridge.

22:45.110 --> 22:47.817
So I wrote to the author
to find out more.

22:49.950 --> 22:50.939
And?

22:54.950 --> 22:56.781
Claire found Jamie.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.746
They were reunited.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.996
They lived in North Caro/Ina

23:04.920 --> 23:09.926
from about 1768 at a settlement
cal/ed Fraser’s Ridge.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.387
It’s not far from Mount Helicon,

23:13.470 --> 23:16.303
which is now called
Grandfather Mountain.

23:17.310 --> 23:19.050
The place where the festival was held?

23:19.270 --> 23:21.340
Aye, the same mountain range.

23:21.690 --> 23:24.227
- So they were early Americans?
- Aye.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.238
I have here in front of me
a land grant showing

23:27.320 --> 23:31.233
Jamie received 10,000 acres from
the Governor of North Carolina.

23:31.700 --> 23:32.735
You ’re kidding.

23:32.820 --> 23:35.903
And a letter from a woman
to her family in England

23:35.990 --> 23:41.326
which mentions a James Fraser,
and quote, "his wife Claire, a healer."

23:44.960 --> 23:48.088
Bree? Are you... Are you there?

23:48.170 --> 23:50.547
I'm here. I just...

23:53.010 --> 23:55.638
Roger, I cannot tell you
what this means to me.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.220
Thank you for looking,

23:59.350 --> 24:00.806
despite everything that happened.

24:02.940 --> 24:04.100
Of course.

24:09.650 --> 24:13.359
Well, I have essays to mark.

24:16.740 --> 24:17.729
Yeah.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.546
Goodbye, Brianna.

24:28.670 --> 24:29.705
Goodbye.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.606
We could build somewhere else.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.946
We do have 10,000 acres.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.867
No.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.945
This is the place.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.861
Close to the stream
where the earth is tillable

25:02.460 --> 25:04.030
and we're sheltered from the east wind.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.245
Perhaps we should

25:07.500 --> 25:09.832
move further away from
the shared border, then.

25:14.260 --> 25:18.173
Something as small as a wee line
on a map didn't stop them today.

25:19.390 --> 25:21.927
If they mean to be rid of us,
they'll come,

25:22.770 --> 25:24.510
no matter where we settle on this ridge.

25:25.730 --> 25:29.518
And from what you've told me,
there are Indians all over these lands.

25:30.150 --> 25:33.699
So, no matter where we settle,
we'll have the same problem.

25:37.320 --> 25:41.996
You remember the skull I showed you,
the Indian I saw?

25:43.210 --> 25:46.953
I had thought that perhaps he was
the one who led us back to each other,

25:48.880 --> 25:50.336
guided us to this place.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.416
What if it was a warning?

25:55.050 --> 25:58.599
He's someone like me,
someone from the future.

25:59.470 --> 26:02.849
What if he knows that
something bad happens here?

26:07.150 --> 26:09.106
Ghost or not, Sassenach,

26:10.320 --> 26:13.858
I canna tell you what it is for me
to feel the rightness of this place.

26:15.110 --> 26:18.193
Wasn't just your ghost
that brought us here.

26:20.410 --> 26:23.698
The mountain spoke to me.

26:26.920 --> 26:27.909
Trouble is,

26:29.250 --> 26:34.005
I canna speak with this tribe,
to tell them I mean to honour

26:34.090 --> 26:37.332
the boundary lines,
and be a considerate neighbour.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.499
Mmm-hmm.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.097
Perhaps we should make
a gesture of goodwill.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.549
Aye.

26:45.890 --> 26:48.131
I'll speak with John Quincy Myers
in the morning.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.795
Shh.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.669
Rollo.

27:30.690 --> 27:31.679
The Cherokee.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.766
Where are they?

28:39.010 --> 28:39.999
They took our meat!

28:42.840 --> 28:44.080
They mean for us to starve.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.299
Here.

29:12.330 --> 29:13.490
It's Finley.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.790
It's all right.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.421
Uncle, look.

29:37.230 --> 29:38.390
This isn't the Cherokee.

29:40.190 --> 29:41.316
This is a bear.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.827
A bear a-roaming, eh?

29:51.580 --> 29:53.992
A fearful sight to behold
if ever I saw one.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.913
Doing more than roaming.
It nearly cost me a horse.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.047
Come to think of it,
the Cherokee did tell me

30:02.130 --> 30:04.371
they'd been visited by a Tskili Yona.

30:05.090 --> 30:07.797
- A what?
- Tskili Yona.

30:08.550 --> 30:12.589
"Yona" is their word for bear,
but "tskili" I'm less familiar with.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.223
I gather it conjures a notion
of "wickedness" or "evil."

30:18.150 --> 30:20.937
An evil spirit in the form of a bear,
by my reckoning.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.062
They believe it's a, a monster?

30:27.530 --> 30:30.522
They certainly believe
it's something more than a mere bear.

30:35.290 --> 30:38.032
_ You'll take that meat
smce you lost your provrsrons.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.371
I didn't come for charity.
I came for counsel.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.829
And I'll give you some.

30:48.050 --> 30:52.168
Without food in your bellies,
your minds will be empty too.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.018
Huh. Claire tells me it's very tasty.

30:59.230 --> 31:01.221
You'll come by food again soon enough.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.140
Threats from Cherokee, however...

31:05.280 --> 31:07.737
Well, that's a matter
that requires more thought.

31:09.030 --> 31:13.865
By returning your boundary posts to you
yesterday, they've given you a message.

31:14.830 --> 31:15.899
Hmm.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.781
They didn't get all of them, at least.

31:19.670 --> 31:24.289
I was hoping to make them an offer,
but I dinna ken what exactly.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.171
Tobacco is always welcomed.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.136
And you're in luck.

31:33.050 --> 31:35.712
I obtained a goodly amount
from your aunt.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.267
I'll be happy to oblige you
a portion of it.

31:38.350 --> 31:40.932
I'll only take it
if you allow me to repay you.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.688
And I shall take it to them at once,
but I dinna ken their customs.

31:47.740 --> 31:48.855
How do you approach them?

31:49.200 --> 31:51.600
When you enter, if you want
to greet them with respect,

31:51.700 --> 31:54.658
say,
’(Siyo gina/i ”

31:56.870 --> 31:57.905
Siyo gina/i.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.209
Though the Cherokee are restless
just now, I'm known to them.

32:03.330 --> 32:06.914
Perhaps it's best I take the tobacco
to them on your behalf.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.548
Maybe you're right. Thank you, John.

32:13.050 --> 32:15.848
Truth be told, that bear
may have been a stroke of fortune.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.689
Put off building your cabin
until this matter is resolved.

32:21.810 --> 32:23.516
The Cherokee gave you a warning.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.721
Next time,
they might not be so courteous.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.940
Uncle Jamie wﬂl be pleased.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.982
It's a good catch, apart from
the leviathan that tore through the net.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.030
Have you mended it yet?

32:40.120 --> 32:41.997
Aye, almost.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.036
Oh.

32:46.540 --> 32:47.950
Good hand for it.

32:48.960 --> 32:52.293
Well, it's akin to knitting.
Ma taught me well.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.716
You have to be wary of your stitches.

32:56.550 --> 32:58.802
Too close together,
and you'll soon run out of yarn.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.470
Too far apart,

33:00.980 --> 33:03.096
and you'll be walking around
with holes where you dinna want them.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.476
I never learned how to knit.

33:07.190 --> 33:10.148
That canna be.
Everyone kens how to click it.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.107
Ah, I can sew a dress or a wound,

33:15.410 --> 33:18.868
but knitting is not something
I was ever taught.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.196
What'd you do for winter stockings
in Boston, then?

33:22.290 --> 33:23.359
I bought them.

33:24.750 --> 33:27.537
Everyone at Lallybroch knits,
from the time they can hold a needle.

33:30.630 --> 33:32.962
- Even Jamie?
- Aye.

33:33.510 --> 33:36.252
Uncle Jamie knitted me a fine pair
of stockings for my baptism.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.051
I'd be happy to teach you.

33:40.140 --> 33:42.301
When I get my hands
on a skein of wool,

33:42.390 --> 33:43.971
I'll have you knitting
in no time at all.

33:46.060 --> 33:48.893
For the moment, I'd better
get these ready to cook.

33:49.150 --> 33:50.139
Aye.

33:50.940 --> 33:52.066
I'll look in on Finley.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.736
Do you suppose the bear
might still be roaming about?

34:02.370 --> 34:04.611
With any luck, he's gone back to sleep,

34:06.250 --> 34:10.539
- though be careful all the same.
- Aye. You too.

34:11.710 --> 34:12.870
Come, Rollo.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.148
A shame we canna eat wood
or we'd have our supper.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.562
Well, fortunately,
we've plenty of trout.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.481
You ken there are easier ways
of catching fish.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.989
With that bear around, I thought
I'd see ifI remembered how to shoot.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.320
Seems you haven't forgotten much.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.667
I dinna think you packed
your powder well enough.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.599
I've always marvelled how soldiers
could do that in the heat of battle.

35:00.850 --> 35:05.093
Aye, it's one thing when you've
all the time in the world,

35:06.730 --> 35:11.474
but when your enemy's charging at you,
it's a different matter entirely.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.475
Uncle Jamie?

36:22.340 --> 36:24.342
- I don't see it.
- Aye.

36:29.350 --> 36:30.726
Maybe we scared it off.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.689
Rollo?

36:44.450 --> 36:45.610
What have you got?

36:49.120 --> 36:50.280
That's human.

36:55.420 --> 36:56.409
Here!

37:02.050 --> 37:03.677
- Myers.
- What's he doing here?

37:07.890 --> 37:09.096
The bear.

37:10.730 --> 37:11.879
He's been mauled.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.317
Tskili Yona...

37:20.740 --> 37:22.105
Tskili Yona...

37:37.750 --> 37:38.876
Tskili Yona.

37:39.130 --> 37:41.701
- He looks so pale.
- I need my medical kit.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.870
We have to get him back
to the shelter now!

37:45.590 --> 37:47.251
Tskili Yona.

37:48.390 --> 37:49.505
Tskili Yona...

37:58.860 --> 38:01.567
He has severe muscle damage.
Ian, hold this. Apply pressure.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.902
- Where are you going?
- It's still close.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.360
You'll get yourself killed.

38:12.330 --> 38:14.321
Well, if I don't go after it,
it'll come back.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.706
- I'll go with you.
- No.

38:15.790 --> 38:17.326
Stay here and help your auntie.
You understand?

38:17.420 --> 38:18.409
Aye.

40:23.210 --> 40:25.792
I'm going to have to tie off
his blood vessels.

40:29.380 --> 40:30.665
He's been bitten.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.545
Well, what is it?

40:33.590 --> 40:34.796
It wasn't a bear.

43:03.790 --> 43:06.497
Siyo gina/i.

43:08.290 --> 43:09.279
You killed him?

43:16.470 --> 43:17.459
I did.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.803
Tskili Yona. Tskili Yona.

43:28.810 --> 43:30.095
He's only a man...

43:33.320 --> 43:34.560
not a monster.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.363
Oftentimes, man is monster.

43:47.620 --> 43:49.611
- You knew he was a man?
- Yes.

43:50.120 --> 43:53.032
He lived among us.
He was once a great warrior.

43:54.040 --> 43:55.371
But no more?

43:55.500 --> 43:57.877
He harmed his woman one year ago.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.461
He laid with her against her wishes.

44:01.430 --> 44:04.752
That is not our way, so he was banished

44:05.510 --> 44:08.058
to live alone in the woods.
No Cherokee.

44:09.060 --> 44:10.379
He did not accept this.

44:11.230 --> 44:16.770
He returned to us again and again,
but we would not see him.

44:17.860 --> 44:22.729
So he went deep into the woods,
and his mind was lost forever.

44:24.030 --> 44:27.409
Took the form of a bear.
He became Tskili.

44:28.750 --> 44:32.618
He came to us again this year,
destroying shelters, stealing food,

44:32.710 --> 44:35.087
but we could not kill
what was already dead to us.

44:38.210 --> 44:41.543
Now there will be
no more trouble from him.

44:43.220 --> 44:44.209
And from you?

44:48.520 --> 44:51.341
Will there be trouble
for me and my family?

44:51.730 --> 44:55.439
Death follows white men like
the Great Spirit follows Aniyunwiya.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.350
I'm not Tskili.

44:58.690 --> 45:00.738
My family and I wish to live peacefully.

45:05.620 --> 45:06.939
I give you my word.

45:16.630 --> 45:19.451
Try to walk a bit every day.
It'll help keep your strength up.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.502
I'll do whatever you say, Mistress.
I owe you my life.

45:24.640 --> 45:25.880
We all do.

45:26.930 --> 45:28.716
I didn't wish for you to be digging
a burying ground

45:28.810 --> 45:29.799
before building your cabin.

45:31.100 --> 45:33.842
You're welcome to remain
WIth us until you're well.

45:45.030 --> 45:47.737
Our chief, Nawohali.

45:54.790 --> 45:57.998
He prays that no more blood
is spilled between us.

46:02.550 --> 46:04.040
That is our wish as well.

46:16.230 --> 46:17.299
"Yona dihi"?

46:23.860 --> 46:26.021
It means "bear killer."

46:26.990 --> 46:29.311
That is how you will be known
to our people.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.206
"Bear killer"?

46:40.960 --> 46:41.949
Join us.

46:51.560 --> 46:53.266
- Please.
- I'm Giduhwa.

46:54.220 --> 46:57.189
This is my husband's grandmother,
Adawehi.

46:58.560 --> 46:59.549
I'm Claire.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.310
She had a dream about you.

47:18.370 --> 47:22.955
The moon was in the water,
and you became a white raven.

47:23.590 --> 47:26.662
You flew over the water
and swallowed the moon.

47:27.380 --> 47:32.500
The white raven flew back,
and laid an egg in the palm of her hand.

47:32.600 --> 47:37.515
The egg split open,
and there was a shining stone inside.

47:37.680 --> 47:42.265
She knew this was great magic,
that the stone could heal sickness.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.640
She's a healer.

47:44.780 --> 47:46.566
A very powerful healer.

47:49.860 --> 47:54.149
My husband's grandmother says that
you have medicine now,

47:56.080 --> 47:57.399
but you will have more.

47:58.210 --> 48:04.160
When your hair is white like snow,
you will have wisdom beyond time.

48:10.180 --> 48:15.254
You must not be troubled.
Death is sent from the gods.

48:17.140 --> 48:18.676
It will not be your fault.

48:23.860 --> 48:25.646
I'm not sure I understand.

48:37.330 --> 48:38.365
Come.

48:53.050 --> 48:54.381
I think this is the last of them.

48:55.350 --> 48:56.920
Thanks for storing them for me.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.971
What do you think?

49:01.270 --> 49:02.680
It's very...

49:04.480 --> 49:05.549
Aye.

49:08.860 --> 49:12.148
So, have you spoken to her?

49:13.950 --> 49:16.271
For all of five minutes a week ago.

49:17.950 --> 49:19.747
It's a start.

49:22.120 --> 49:23.781
First time since...

49:24.880 --> 49:27.371
Since my proposal, aye.

49:30.960 --> 49:33.622
And? How did it go?

49:34.050 --> 49:37.838
Fine, though I'm not sure if
she was happy to hear from me

49:37.930 --> 49:40.558
or if it was the news
I'd found that her mother...

49:41.770 --> 49:43.726
Um...

49:43.810 --> 49:47.109
Took a trip
and found a lost love of hers.

49:48.980 --> 49:52.768
You mean when she went back
in time to find Jamie Fraser?

49:55.610 --> 49:56.736
Backin".

49:57.200 --> 49:59.407
What do you mean?

50:00.160 --> 50:02.037
These walls are not as thick
as you think.

50:02.910 --> 50:05.037
I heard you in the study
with Claire and Brianna

50:05.120 --> 50:07.418
speaking of the legendary Highlander.

50:08.380 --> 50:12.123
Granny was a caller at the stones.
She led the dances.

50:12.960 --> 50:16.179
I ken all the stories
of people disappearing.

50:16.510 --> 50:19.889
So you knew? All this time?

50:20.600 --> 50:21.589
Aye.

50:24.810 --> 50:29.224
I suspected that it would
take its toll on Brianna...

50:31.020 --> 50:32.897
Parting from her mother.

50:33.150 --> 50:36.278
Aye, she couldn't stop worrying
about whether Claire found him,

50:37.450 --> 50:39.771
so I kept looking until
I found some proof she had.

50:40.530 --> 50:42.578
Brianna must have been thrilled.

50:42.660 --> 50:43.740
Aye, she was.

50:44.750 --> 50:49.949
I thought it might be a new beginning,
or something, but then...

50:50.040 --> 50:51.337
You haven't heard from her.

50:54.460 --> 50:55.620
At least she knows.

51:00.510 --> 51:01.499
What?

51:02.970 --> 51:04.426
I wasn't sure if I should show you.

51:07.940 --> 51:11.853
Granny used to help the Reverend
with his research.

51:13.110 --> 51:15.146
I have some of her papers

51:17.150 --> 51:19.869
that I came across whe_n Ernie and I
were unpacking.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.236
- An obituary?
- Aye.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.239
This...

51:27.330 --> 51:30.663
"It is with grief that
the news is received

51:30.790 --> 51:34.248
"of the deaths by fire
of James MacKenzie Fraser

51:36.670 --> 51:40.834
"and his wife in a conflagration
that destroyed the home

51:42.600 --> 51:44.340
"on the settlement of Fraser's Ridge."

51:50.600 --> 51:55.435
The date's smudged.
let of January, 1770-something.

51:56.900 --> 51:59.562
They received the land in 1768.

51:59.650 --> 52:04.986
_ So that means some time_
In the next 12 years, they dIe.

52:11.540 --> 52:14.452
For all we know, they died two years
after receiving their land.

52:16.460 --> 52:19.008
They might not have lived
to see it become America.

52:20.050 --> 52:21.836
Brianna will be devastated.

52:27.600 --> 52:28.885
I can't tell her.

52:30.230 --> 52:32.596
But shouldn't she know the truth?

52:32.850 --> 52:34.226
Her mother's dead...

52:34.310 --> 52:38.394
She's been dead, Fi,
for over 200 years.

52:39.070 --> 52:40.446
Brianna knows that much.

52:40.700 --> 52:41.689
This...

52:44.700 --> 52:47.692
This will just break her heart
all over again.

52:49.450 --> 52:50.451
Aye.

52:52.750 --> 52:54.035
I suppose you're right.

53:56.190 --> 53:58.647
What are you doing?

53:59.650 --> 54:02.483
Carrying my wife over the threshold.

54:04.070 --> 54:08.655
And this'll be the door,
lined with hides to keep out the cold.

54:09.990 --> 54:11.070
And over here,

54:12.290 --> 54:18.536
we'll have a wee pantry and a hearth,
where I'll perform a hearth blessing.

54:19.420 --> 54:21.752
Perhaps you should start sooner
rather than later.

54:22.550 --> 54:24.711
- We need all the help we can get.
-Hmm.

54:26.680 --> 54:31.674
We'll build shelves for our books,
have candles so we can read at night.

54:32.390 --> 54:38.056
We can put a fine table
in the middle for our dinners.

54:39.270 --> 54:42.068
And over there will be our bed.

54:43.650 --> 54:47.654
Facing east so we can watch
every sunrise.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.109
It's perfect.

55:33.830 --> 55:34.819
Hello?

55:35.580 --> 55:39.573
Hello, this is Roger Wakefield.
May I speak with Brianna Randall?

55:40.960 --> 55:43.201
This is Gayle, her roommate.

55:44.460 --> 55:47.338
Is this the Roger?

55:48.630 --> 55:52.179
Uh, it is, aye. Is she at home?

55:53.260 --> 55:55.012
No, no, she's not.

55:56.390 --> 55:57.630
She didn't tell you?

55:58.940 --> 55:59.929
Tell me what?

56:00.650 --> 56:01.935
She went to Scotland.

56:03.110 --> 56:04.316
To Scotland? Why?

56:05.820 --> 56:07.105
To visit her mother.

56:10.320 --> 56:11.309
How long ago?

56:11.610 --> 56:12.986
A couple of weeks ago.

56:13.530 --> 56:15.441
Thought you two would have
seen each other by now.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.029
Roger?

56:22.330 --> 56:23.319
Hello?

56:23.710 --> 56:24.836
Um...

56:25.750 --> 56:28.799
Thanks, Gayle. I'll try her again.
