WEBVTT

00:34.451 --> 00:36.744
This is Berk.

00:36.912 --> 00:41.290
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a
few degrees South of freezing to death.

00:41.458 --> 00:45.211
It's located solidly on
the meridian of misery.

00:46.171 --> 00:49.799
My village. In a word, sturdy.

00:49.967 --> 00:54.637
It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.

00:54.805 --> 00:58.850
We have fishing, hunting and a
charming view of the sunsets.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.019
The only problems are the pests.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.441
You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.776
We have...

01:11.655 --> 01:13.072
...dragons.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.659
Most people would leave. Not us.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.455
We're Vikings. We have
stubbornness issues.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.624
My name is Hiccup.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.170
Great name, I know. But
it's not the worst.

01:27.337 --> 01:31.007
Parents believe a hideous name will
frighten off gnomes and trolls.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.509
Like our charming Viking
demeanor wouldn't do that.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.678
Morning!

01:37.848 --> 01:39.682
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!

01:39.850 --> 01:42.643
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!

01:45.189 --> 01:49.734
Hiccup! What is he doing? What
are you doing out?! Get inside!

01:49.902 --> 01:53.529
That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.

01:53.697 --> 01:58.534
When he was a baby, he popped a
dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.787
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

02:00.954 --> 02:01.954
What have we got?

02:02.122 --> 02:05.917
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.503
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.713
Good.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.715
Hoist the torches!

02:18.388 --> 02:21.557
Nice of you to join the party! I
thought you'd been carried off!

02:21.725 --> 02:26.562
Who, me? No, come on, I'm way
too muscular for their taste.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.899
They wouldn't know what
to do with all this.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.901
They need toothpicks,
don't they?

02:33.028 --> 02:36.280
The meathead with attitude and
interchangeable hands is Gobber.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.667
I've been his apprentice
since I was little.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.910
Well, littler.

02:41.245 --> 02:45.081
Move to the lower defenses. We'll
counterattack with the catapults.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.374
Hurry!

02:47.459 --> 02:50.753
See? Old village, lots
and lots of new houses.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.255
Fire!

02:52.422 --> 02:53.714
Let's go!

02:54.341 --> 02:58.469
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the
twins: Ruff nut and Tuffnut...

02:59.012 --> 03:00.221
...and...

03:01.932 --> 03:03.432
...Astrid.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.820
Their job is so much cooler.

03:16.947 --> 03:20.366
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my Mark.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.452
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.454
Please, two minutes.
I'll kill a dragon.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.791
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.627
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.337
You can't even throw
one of these!

03:35.674 --> 03:38.676
OK, fine, but this
will throw it for me.

03:40.304 --> 03:43.222
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

03:43.390 --> 03:45.433
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!

03:45.601 --> 03:48.644
If you ever want to get out
there to fight dragons...

03:48.812 --> 03:51.814
...you need to stop all this.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.066
But you just pointed
to all of me.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.612
Yes, that's it! Stop
being all of you.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.780
Oh, yes.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.658
You, sir, are playing
a dangerous game.

04:02.826 --> 04:06.829
Keeping this much raw
Vikingness contained?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.664
There will be consequences!

04:08.832 --> 04:12.293
I'll take my chances. Sword.
Sharpen. Now.

04:13.754 --> 04:18.007
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...

04:18.175 --> 04:20.009
...is everything around here.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.680
A Nadder head is sure to
get me at least noticed.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.265
Gronckles are tough.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.685
Taking down one of those would
definitely get me a girlfriend.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.812
A Zippleback?

04:33.357 --> 04:35.775
Exotic. Two heads,
twice the status.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.193
They found the sheep!

04:37.361 --> 04:39.528
Concentrate fire
over the lower bank.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.364
- Hurry up!
- Fire!

04:42.157 --> 04:44.700
And then there's the
Monstrous Nightmare.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.745
Only the best Vikings
go after those.

04:47.913 --> 04:51.874
They have this nasty habit of
setting themselves on fire.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.212
Reload! I'll take care of this.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.717
But the ultimate prize is the
dragon no one's ever seen.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.886
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!

05:04.054 --> 05:05.388
Get down!

05:08.392 --> 05:09.892
Jump!

05:10.727 --> 05:14.438
This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...

05:15.899 --> 05:17.692
...never misses.

05:17.859 --> 05:22.613
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.908
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.287
Stay. Put. There.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.457
You know what I mean.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.086
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!

05:37.254 --> 05:38.629
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!

05:44.386 --> 05:45.761
Let's get him!

05:46.304 --> 05:47.763
Mind yourselves!

05:47.931 --> 05:49.932
The devils still have
some juice in them!

05:59.985 --> 06:03.279
Come on. Give me something to shoot at.
Give me something to shoot at.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.637
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

06:28.847 --> 06:30.848
Did anybody see that?

06:32.267 --> 06:33.517
Except for you.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.901
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!

07:00.670 --> 07:02.338
You're all out.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.013
Oh, and there's one more
thing you need to know.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.484
Sorry, Dad.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.703
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.

07:35.247 --> 07:39.291
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!

07:39.459 --> 07:41.710
You guys were busy. I
had a very clear shot.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.381
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

07:45.549 --> 07:46.841
Stop!

07:47.300 --> 07:49.051
Just stop.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.429
Every time you step
outside, disaster follows.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.640
Can you not see that I
have bigger problems?

07:54.808 --> 07:58.394
Winter is almost here and I
have an entire village to feed!

07:59.563 --> 08:03.649
Between you and me, the village could
do with a little less feeding.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.734
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

08:05.902 --> 08:09.071
Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?

08:09.239 --> 08:13.868
I can't stop myself. I see a
dragon and I have to just kill it.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.036
It's who I am, Dad.

08:16.204 --> 08:21.417
You're many things, Hiccup. But a
dragon killer is not one of them.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.377
Get back to the house.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.504
Make sure he gets there.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.299
I have his mess to clean up.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.551
Quite the performance.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.511
I've never seen anyone mess up that badly.
That helped.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.307
Thank you, thank you.
I was trying.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.770
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.190
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.109
When he does, it's with
this disappointed scowl,

08:47.277 --> 08:49.695
like someone skimped on
meat in his sandwich.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.908
"Excuse me, barmaid. You brought
me the wrong offspring."

08:54.075 --> 08:58.829
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.749
"This here, this is a
talking fishbone."

09:01.917 --> 09:03.959
You're thinking
about this wrong.

09:04.127 --> 09:08.589
It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.133
Thank you for summing that up.

09:11.468 --> 09:15.512
Look, the point is, stop trying so
hard to be something you're not.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.015
I just want to be
one of you guys.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.111
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

09:31.655 --> 09:33.822
It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.991
If we find the nest
and destroy it,

09:36.159 --> 09:39.328
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

09:39.496 --> 09:41.997
One more search before
the ice sets in.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.166
Those ships never come back.

09:44.334 --> 09:48.796
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.
Now who's with me?!

09:48.964 --> 09:49.964
Count me out.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.332
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.511
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.263
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!

09:57.430 --> 09:58.514
That's more like it.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.850
I'll pack my undies.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.937
No, I need you to stay and
train some new recruits.

10:05.105 --> 10:09.525
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.861
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.030
What could possibly go wrong?

10:15.198 --> 10:17.324
What am I going to
do with him, Gobber?

10:17.492 --> 10:18.826
Put him in training.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.203
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.206
He'd be killed before the first
dragon is out of its cage.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.958
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.584
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.961
No, you don't.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.879
Listen, you know what he's like.

10:31.047 --> 10:35.009
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.680
He doesn't listen. He has the
attention span of a sparrow.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.350
I take him fishing and he
goes hunting for trolls!

10:43.518 --> 10:46.061
Trolls exist. They
steal your socks.

10:46.229 --> 10:49.231
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.760
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.694
...my father told me to bang my
head against a rock and I did it.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.655
I thought it was crazy, but
I didn't question him.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.991
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.118
That rock split in two.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.371
It taught me what a
Viking could do, Gobber.

11:04.539 --> 11:08.542
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

11:09.544 --> 11:13.756
Even as a boy, I knew what I
was, what I had to become.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.425
Hiccup is not that boy.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.886
You can't stop him, Stoick.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.221
You can only prepare him.

11:21.389 --> 11:25.601
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.855
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.292
Oh, the gods hate me.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.629
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.799
I manage to lose
an entire dragon.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.308
Oh, wow. I did it.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.396
I did it. This fixes everything!
Yes!

12:52.564 --> 12:54.898
I have brought down
this mighty beast!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.304
I'm going to kill you, dragon.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.725
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.187
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

14:07.388 --> 14:09.306
I did this.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.631
Hiccup.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.508
Dad...

15:27.135 --> 15:29.177
...I have to talk to you, Dad.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.513
I need to speak
with you, too, son.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.392
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.560
- What?
- What?

15:36.728 --> 15:39.438
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.689
All right.

15:41.274 --> 15:45.193
You get your wish. Dragon training...
you start in the morning.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.362
Oh, man, I should
have gone first.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.281
I was thinking, you know,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.451
we have a surplus of
dragon-fighting Vikings,

15:52.619 --> 15:57.205
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.373
You'll need this.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.751
I don't want to fight dragons.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.336
Come on. Yes, you do.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.381
Rephrase. Dad, I
can't kill dragons.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.342
But you will kill dragons.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.511
No, I'm really very
extra-sure that I won't.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.555
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.891
This is serious, son.

16:16.559 --> 16:21.313
When you carry this axe, you
carry all of us with you.

16:21.481 --> 16:25.150
Which means you walk like
us, you talk like us...

16:25.318 --> 16:27.194
...you think like us.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.529
No more of... this.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.657
You just gestured to all of me.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.118
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.578
Deal?

16:38.456 --> 16:39.581
Deal.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.209
Good.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.087
Train hard.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.756
I'll be back. Probably.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.467
And I'll be here.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.260
Maybe.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.764
Welcome to dragon training!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.350
No turning back.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.618
I hope I get some serious burns.

17:17.787 --> 17:21.373
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.791
Yeah, it's only fun if you
get a scar out of it.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.210
Yeah, no kidding, right?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.378
Pain. Love it.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.256
Oh, great. Who let him in?

17:29.424 --> 17:32.134
Let's get started! The
recruit who does best

17:32.301 --> 17:34.928
will win the honor of
killing his first dragon

17:35.096 --> 17:36.805
in front of the entire village.

17:36.973 --> 17:41.476
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?

17:41.644 --> 17:44.146
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

17:44.313 --> 17:48.316
Don't worry. You're small and weak...
that'll make you less of a target.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.235
They'll see you
as sick or insane

17:50.403 --> 17:53.572
and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.284
Behind these doors are just
a few of the many species

17:57.452 --> 17:58.452
you will learn to fight!

17:58.619 --> 18:01.121
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.622
The Hideous Zippleback.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.166
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.334
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.503
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.380
Can you stop that?!

18:10.548 --> 18:13.425
And the Gronckle.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.677
Jaw strength 8.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.365
Wait, aren't you gonna
teach us first?

18:17.513 --> 18:20.015
I believe in
learning on the job.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.853
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...

18:25.646 --> 18:27.147
...you're dead!

18:27.315 --> 18:28.940
What's the first
thing you'll need?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.859
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?

18:31.194 --> 18:33.236
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!

18:33.905 --> 18:36.698
Your most important piece of
equipment is your shield!

18:36.866 --> 18:40.869
If you must choose between a sword
or a shield, take the shield!

18:41.245 --> 18:43.038
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!

18:43.206 --> 18:45.286
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.584
Oops, this one has blood on it.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.671
- Tuffnut, Ruff nut! You're out!
- What?

18:51.839 --> 18:53.507
Shields are good
for another thing.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.928
Noise! Make lots of it to
throw off a dragon's aim!

18:59.263 --> 19:01.723
All dragons have a
limited number of shots.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.100
How many does a Gronckle have?

19:04.268 --> 19:05.560
- Five?
- No, six!

19:05.728 --> 19:07.896
Correct, six! That's
one for each of you!

19:08.481 --> 19:10.398
Fishlegs, out!

19:10.566 --> 19:12.609
Hiccup, get in there!

19:15.238 --> 19:18.907
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.700
You look like you work out.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.744
Snotlout! You're done!

19:22.912 --> 19:24.579
So it's just you and me, huh?

19:24.747 --> 19:26.373
Nope, just you.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.251
One shot left!

19:30.545 --> 19:31.628
Hiccup!

19:39.762 --> 19:41.638
And that's six.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.850
Go back to bed, you
overgrown sausage!

19:46.769 --> 19:49.563
You'll get another
chance, don't you worry.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.732
Remember, a dragon will always,

19:52.984 --> 19:56.444
always go for the kill.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.662
So... why didn't you?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.691
This was stupid.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.904
Why don't you just fly away?

21:57.066 --> 21:59.734
All right, where did Astrid
go wrong in the ring today?

21:59.902 --> 22:02.654
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.407
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.575
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."

22:07.743 --> 22:10.286
She's right. You have to
be tough on yourselves.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.205
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

22:12.373 --> 22:14.874
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.751
He's never where he should be.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.837
Thank you, Astrid.

22:19.088 --> 22:23.591
You need to live and breathe this stuff.
The dragon manual.

22:24.427 --> 22:27.971
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.559
No attacks tonight. Study up.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.352
Wait, you mean read?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.770
While we're still alive?

22:35.938 --> 22:37.856
Why read words when you
can just kill the stuff

22:38.024 --> 22:39.691
the words tell you stuff about?

22:39.859 --> 22:42.777
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon

22:42.945 --> 22:46.239
that sprays boiling water at your face.
And there's this other one...

22:46.657 --> 22:48.074
Yeah. That sounds great.

22:48.242 --> 22:51.453
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...

22:51.620 --> 22:53.204
You guys read. I'll
go kill stuff.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.499
Another one has
spines like trees.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.835
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

22:59.128 --> 23:03.798
All mine, then. Wow. So,
OK, I'll see you...

23:04.133 --> 23:05.592
...tomorrow.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.562
Dragon classifications.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.982
Strike class. Fear class.
Mystery class.

23:21.859 --> 23:26.654
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.824
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

23:29.992 --> 23:31.743
that can kill a man
at close range.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.829
Extremely dangerous.
Kill on sight.

23:34.997 --> 23:38.833
Timberjack. This gigantic
creature has razor-sharp wings

23:39.001 --> 23:40.960
that can slice through
full-grown trees.

23:41.128 --> 23:44.130
Extremely dangerous.
Kill on sight.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.705
Scauldron. Sprays scalding
water at its victim.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.135
Extremely dangerous.

23:55.059 --> 23:59.229
Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons
can spray acid. Kill on sight.

23:59.522 --> 24:03.066
Gronckle. Zippleback.
The Skrill.

24:03.526 --> 24:06.694
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.864
Burns its victims.
Buries its victims.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.992
Chokes its victims. Turns
its victims inside out.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.995
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.874
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.
Kill on sight.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.044
Night Fury.

24:23.712 --> 24:27.257
Speed unknown. Size unknown.

24:27.716 --> 24:31.886
The unholy offspring of
lightning and death itself.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.847
Never engage this dragon.

24:34.014 --> 24:38.184
Your only chance: Hide and
pray it does not find you.

24:52.116 --> 24:54.075
I can almost smell them.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.869
They're close.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.329
Steady.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.341
Take us in.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.261
Hard to port. For
Helheim's Gate.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.263
Hard to port!

25:19.101 --> 25:20.768
Steady!

25:33.073 --> 25:37.285
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

25:37.578 --> 25:42.123
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?

25:43.500 --> 25:46.502
Focus, Hiccup! You're
not even trying!

25:48.255 --> 25:51.382
Today it's all about attack!

25:51.842 --> 25:54.260
Nadders are quick and
light on their feet.

25:54.428 --> 25:57.138
Your job is to be
quicker and lighter!

25:59.433 --> 26:02.143
I'm really beginning to
question your teaching methods!

26:02.311 --> 26:04.771
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.857
Find it, hide in it and strike!

26:09.401 --> 26:10.777
Do you ever bathe?

26:10.945 --> 26:13.529
If you don't like it, then
just get your own blind spot.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.657
How about I give you one?

26:17.326 --> 26:20.245
Blind spot, yes. Deaf
spot, not so much.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.123
Hey, so, how would one
sneak up on a Night Fury?

26:24.291 --> 26:27.794
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!

26:27.962 --> 26:30.296
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!

26:30.464 --> 26:31.798
Get down.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.939
Watch out, babe. I'll
take care of this.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.943
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.070
What do you want me to
do, block out the sun?

26:54.238 --> 26:56.155
I could do that but
I don't have time!

26:56.323 --> 26:58.116
They probably...

26:58.284 --> 27:02.078
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.372
Has anyone ever
seen one napping?

27:04.873 --> 27:08.710
Hiccup!

27:11.422 --> 27:13.715
Love on the battlefield.

27:13.882 --> 27:14.924
She could do better.

27:15.092 --> 27:16.718
Let me... Why don't you?

27:26.186 --> 27:27.520
Well done, Astrid.

27:29.523 --> 27:32.233
Is this some kind
of a joke to you?

27:32.860 --> 27:35.486
Our parents' war is
about to become ours.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.864
Figure out which side you're on.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.155
Toothless.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.533
I could have sworn you had...

29:06.870 --> 29:07.870
...teeth.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.126
No, no, no.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.504
I don't have any more!

33:13.158 --> 33:17.286
And with one twist, he took my
hand and swallowed it whole!

33:17.454 --> 33:20.581
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.041
He must have passed the word,

33:22.209 --> 33:25.753
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.590
Isn't it weird to think your
hand was inside a dragon?

33:29.758 --> 33:31.967
Like if your mind was
still in control of it,

33:32.135 --> 33:35.680
you could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.

33:35.847 --> 33:40.601
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

33:40.769 --> 33:44.772
I'll chop off the legs of every
dragon I fight, with my face.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.442
It's the wings and the
tails you really want.

33:48.610 --> 33:51.070
If it can't fly,
it can't get away.

33:51.238 --> 33:54.532
A downed dragon
is a dead dragon.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.371
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.791
Tomorrow we get to the big
boys, slowly but surely

34:03.959 --> 34:07.169
making our way up to the
Monstrous Nightmare.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.839
But who'll win the
honor of killing it?

34:10.005 --> 34:13.259
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny.
See?

34:13.427 --> 34:15.511
Your Mom let you get a tattoo?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.388
It's not a tattoo,
it's a birthmark.

34:17.556 --> 34:21.308
OK, I've been stuck with you since
birth, and that was never there before.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.311
Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me from the left side.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.521
Hey, Toothless.

35:07.689 --> 35:11.525
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.653
OK, that's disgusting.

35:14.905 --> 35:18.574
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic COD...

35:18.742 --> 35:20.910
...and a whole smoked eel.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.251
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.004
Yeah, I don't really
like eel much, either.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.926
That's it.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.804
That's it. Just stick
with the good stuff.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.933
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,

35:44.392 --> 35:46.936
minding my own business.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.699
It's OK.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.044
OK.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.768
That's not too bad. It works.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.317
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:45.871 --> 36:47.872
Oh, my! It's working!

36:54.087 --> 36:55.963
Yes, yes! I did it!

37:08.226 --> 37:09.226
Yeah!

37:09.394 --> 37:11.353
Today is about teamwork.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.568
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

37:17.819 --> 37:21.697
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.

37:21.990 --> 37:25.326
One head breathes gas, the
other head lights it.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.288
Your job is to know
which is which.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.625
Razor-sharp serrated teeth that
inject venom for pre-digestion.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.127
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

37:35.295 --> 37:36.587
Will you please stop that?!

37:40.842 --> 37:44.678
If that dragon shows either
of his faces, I'm gonna...

37:44.846 --> 37:46.055
There!

37:47.015 --> 37:49.558
Hey, it's us, idiots!

37:49.726 --> 37:52.478
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.023
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure.

37:59.736 --> 38:00.736
Wait.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.991
Oh, I'm hurt! I am
very much hurt!

38:06.159 --> 38:09.036
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.045
Wrong head.

38:18.672 --> 38:19.672
Fishlegs!

38:22.884 --> 38:23.884
Now, Hiccup!

38:26.888 --> 38:28.764
Oh, come on.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.770
Hiccup!

38:36.523 --> 38:39.066
Back, back, back!

38:39.693 --> 38:43.862
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.866
Back into your cage. Now think
about what you've done.

38:57.877 --> 39:02.923
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've
got some things I need to...

39:03.550 --> 39:05.801
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

39:57.937 --> 39:59.855
I've never seen a
Gronckle do that.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.451
I left my axe back in the ring.
You guys go on ahead.

40:02.464 --> 40:04.902
I'll catch up with you.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.069
Meet the Terrible Terror.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.531
It's like the size of my...

40:51.908 --> 40:53.075
Get it off!

40:53.660 --> 40:56.578
Oh, I'm hurt! I am
very much hurt!

40:59.374 --> 41:01.667
Wow! He's better
than you ever were.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.921
Oh, great.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.048
Hiccup.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.524
Hiccup? Are you in there?

42:09.277 --> 42:10.652
Astrid. Hey.

42:10.820 --> 42:13.405
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.
Hi, Astrid.

42:13.573 --> 42:16.491
I normally don't care what people
do, but you're acting weird.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.369
Well, weirder.

42:48.024 --> 42:51.735
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.

42:51.903 --> 42:52.903
Excellent.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.280
I hope you had more
success than me.

42:55.448 --> 42:59.785
Well, if by success, you mean that
your parenting troubles are over, yes.

42:59.994 --> 43:03.288
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

43:03.456 --> 43:05.582
Out with the old and in
with the new, right?

43:05.750 --> 43:09.127
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!

43:09.671 --> 43:10.837
- Come over here.
- Hurry!

43:11.005 --> 43:12.005
He's gone?

43:14.175 --> 43:18.095
Most afternoons, but who can blame him?
The life of a celebrity's rough.

43:18.263 --> 43:22.015
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.183
Hiccup?

43:23.351 --> 43:27.479
Who would have thought it? He
has this way with the beasts.

43:35.697 --> 43:39.324
OK, bud. We're gonna
take this nice and slow.

43:39.492 --> 43:41.243
Here we go. Here we go.
Position...

43:41.911 --> 43:43.912
...three... no, four.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.809
All right, it's go time.
It's go time.

44:11.899 --> 44:13.817
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

44:21.826 --> 44:23.410
Yes, it worked!

44:28.082 --> 44:29.374
Sorry!

44:31.836 --> 44:33.045
It was my fault.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.381
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
Position four.

44:36.883 --> 44:37.883
Three.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.096
Yeah! Go, baby!

44:43.848 --> 44:44.848
Yes!

44:45.016 --> 44:49.186
Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my...
cheat sheet!

44:49.354 --> 44:50.854
Stop!

44:53.566 --> 44:54.858
No!

44:57.945 --> 45:01.323
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

45:01.741 --> 45:04.868
All right, OK, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.829
OK, no, no, no. Come back down towards me!
Come back down...

45:49.664 --> 45:51.289
Yeah!

45:53.126 --> 45:54.209
Come on.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.178
No, thanks. I'm good.

46:42.216 --> 46:45.343
Not so fireproof on
the inside, are you?

46:45.511 --> 46:46.636
Here you go.

47:03.196 --> 47:07.324
Everything we know about
you guys is wrong.

47:17.543 --> 47:20.504
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...

47:20.671 --> 47:21.671
I know.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.093
- I came looking for you.
- You did?

47:27.261 --> 47:28.762
You've been keeping secrets.

47:29.096 --> 47:30.472
I have?

47:30.640 --> 47:33.266
Just how long did you
think you could hide it?

47:33.434 --> 47:36.102
I don't know what you're...

47:36.270 --> 47:40.690
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

47:41.484 --> 47:42.776
So...

47:43.486 --> 47:45.403
...let's talk...

47:45.571 --> 47:47.447
...about that dragon.

47:47.615 --> 47:51.785
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.371
I just didn't know how to...

47:59.168 --> 48:01.294
You're not upset?

48:01.462 --> 48:04.089
What?! I was hoping for this!

48:04.966 --> 48:07.634
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!

48:07.802 --> 48:10.554
Wait till you spill a
Nadder's guts the first time!

48:10.721 --> 48:13.431
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!

48:13.599 --> 48:17.394
What a feeling! You really
had me going there, son!

48:17.562 --> 48:21.731
All those years of the worst
Viking Berk has ever seen.

48:21.899 --> 48:25.193
Odin, it was rough. I
almost gave up on you.

48:25.361 --> 48:27.612
And all the while you
were holding out on me!

48:27.780 --> 48:29.656
Oh, Thor Almighty!

48:31.450 --> 48:33.827
With you doing so
well in the ring...

48:35.162 --> 48:37.831
...we finally have
something to talk about.

48:51.554 --> 48:55.181
Here, I brought you something,

48:55.433 --> 48:58.143
to keep you safe in the ring.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.395
Wow. Thanks.

49:00.563 --> 49:02.991
Your mother would have
wanted you to have it.

49:03.004 --> 49:05.442
It's half of her breastplate.

49:07.028 --> 49:10.864
Matching set. It keeps
her close, you know.

49:11.574 --> 49:16.578
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.

49:22.209 --> 49:26.546
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.

49:26.714 --> 49:29.132
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.508
Thanks for stopping by...

49:30.676 --> 49:33.720
- ...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.599
Well... Yep. Good night.

49:52.573 --> 49:55.575
Stay out of my way! I'm
winning this thing.

49:55.743 --> 49:58.453
Please, by all means.

50:10.508 --> 50:12.592
This time, this time for sure!

50:21.435 --> 50:24.187
No! No, son of a half-troll,

50:24.355 --> 50:27.357
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.359
- So, later.
- Not so fast.

50:29.527 --> 50:31.486
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!

50:31.654 --> 50:34.197
Late for what, exactly?

50:34.365 --> 50:37.200
Quiet down! The
elder has decided.

50:48.629 --> 50:52.882
You've done it, Hiccup! You
get to kill the dragon!

50:56.178 --> 50:57.345
That's my boy!

50:57.513 --> 51:01.224
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait.
I am so...

51:01.392 --> 51:03.309
...leaving! We're leaving.

51:03.477 --> 51:07.939
Let's pack up. Looks like you and
me are taking a little vacation.

51:08.399 --> 51:09.649
Forever.

51:12.403 --> 51:13.945
Oh, man.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.992
What the?! What are
you doing here?

51:19.827 --> 51:22.245
I want to know what's going on.

51:22.413 --> 51:26.499
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.

51:26.667 --> 51:29.502
Start talking! Are you
training with someone?

51:29.670 --> 51:30.712
Training?

51:30.880 --> 51:32.505
It better not involve this.

51:32.673 --> 51:36.301
I know this looks really
bad, but you see...

51:38.679 --> 51:40.680
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

51:40.848 --> 51:45.977
I'm through with the lies. I've
been making outfits. So you got me.

51:46.312 --> 51:50.273
It's time everyone knew. Drag
me back, go ahead. Here we go.

51:50.858 --> 51:52.400
Why would you do that?!

51:52.568 --> 51:56.988
That's for the lies. And
that's for everything else.

51:57.782 --> 51:58.782
Oh, man.

52:00.242 --> 52:01.242
Get down!

52:03.204 --> 52:04.579
Run, run!

52:07.208 --> 52:09.000
It's OK! It's OK.

52:09.335 --> 52:10.710
She's a friend.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.214
You just scared him.

52:14.381 --> 52:15.882
I scared him?!

52:16.884 --> 52:18.510
Who is "him"?

52:19.595 --> 52:23.598
Astrid, Toothless.
Toothless, Astrid.

52:29.730 --> 52:30.897
We're dead.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.025
Where do you think you're going?

52:40.157 --> 52:43.034
Oh, great Odin's ghost!
This is it!

52:53.921 --> 52:56.256
Hiccup, get me down from here!

52:56.423 --> 52:58.591
You have to give me a
chance to explain.

52:58.759 --> 53:01.427
I am not listening to
anything you have to say!

53:01.595 --> 53:05.056
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

53:06.600 --> 53:07.976
Please, Astrid.

53:23.951 --> 53:25.034
Now get me down.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.954
Toothless, down. Gently.

53:29.748 --> 53:32.458
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.338
Toothless!

53:38.340 --> 53:41.342
What is wrong with you?!
Bad dragon!

53:42.469 --> 53:45.346
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.

53:50.895 --> 53:54.022
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

53:57.026 --> 53:59.027
And now the spinning.

53:59.904 --> 54:03.072
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

54:03.824 --> 54:06.826
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

54:07.119 --> 54:08.828
Just get me off of this thing.

55:55.519 --> 55:59.230
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

55:59.565 --> 56:02.108
It's amazing.

56:02.443 --> 56:03.985
He's amazing.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.781
So what now?

56:08.949 --> 56:11.784
Hiccup, your final
exam is tomorrow.

56:12.077 --> 56:14.078
You know you'll have to kill...

56:14.663 --> 56:15.788
...kill a dragon.

56:15.956 --> 56:17.665
Don't remind me.

56:18.792 --> 56:20.209
Toothless, what's happening?

56:22.671 --> 56:24.088
What is it?

56:26.884 --> 56:27.967
Get down!

56:45.235 --> 56:46.986
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

56:47.154 --> 56:50.156
Toothless, you gotta get
us out of here, bud.

56:52.701 --> 56:55.119
It looks like they're
hauling in their kill.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.830
What does that make us?

57:40.749 --> 57:43.251
What my Dad wouldn't
give to find this.

58:00.185 --> 58:03.646
It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.

58:04.314 --> 58:06.649
They're not eating any of it.

58:22.124 --> 58:23.749
What is that?

58:30.883 --> 58:33.885
All right, bud, we got to
get out of here... now!

58:43.270 --> 58:47.064
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

58:47.232 --> 58:49.233
They're the workers and
that's their queen.

58:49.401 --> 58:51.944
It controls them.
Let's find your Dad.

58:52.112 --> 58:53.362
No! No.

58:53.697 --> 58:57.783
No, not yet. They'll
kill Toothless.

58:57.951 --> 59:00.661
We have to think this
through carefully.

59:00.829 --> 59:03.748
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

59:03.916 --> 59:06.626
the thing we've been after since
Vikings first sailed here,

59:06.793 --> 59:09.086
and you want to
keep it a secret?

59:09.254 --> 59:12.173
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?

59:14.301 --> 59:15.509
Yes.

59:22.976 --> 59:25.478
OK. Then what do we do?

59:25.646 --> 59:29.398
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

59:30.150 --> 59:31.317
OK.

59:32.861 --> 59:34.153
That's for kidnapping me.

59:41.161 --> 59:43.871
That's for everything else.

59:53.048 --> 59:55.049
What are you looking at?

59:55.801 --> 59:59.929
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:06.143
I can show my face
in public again!

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.565
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:16.320
Hiccup would go from,
well, being Hiccup

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:20.992
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:23.744
and shipped him off for
fear he'd gone mad!

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:25.746
And you know it!

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:32.712
But here we are. And no
one is more surprised

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:35.881
or more proud than I am.

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.802
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.180
Today, he becomes one of us!

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.061
Be careful with that dragon.

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:52.648
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.901
Put an end to this.
I have to try.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:01:00.031
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.241
just make sure they
don't find Toothless.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.454
I will. Just promise
me it won't go wrong.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:10.458
It's time, Hiccup.
Knock 'em dead.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.466
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:21.886
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:35.941
I would have gone
for the hammer.

01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:41.280
I'm ready.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.932
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.687
What is he doing?

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:19.110
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.160
I'm not one of them.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:34.542
What's he thinking?

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:36.585
- Stop the fight.
- No!

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:39.463
I need you all to see this.

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.508
They're not what
we think they are.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.677
We don't have to kill them.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:48.389
I said, stop the fight!

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.148
Out of my way!

01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:57.899
Hiccup!

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.554
This way!

01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:50.159
Night Fury!

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:10.554
Toothless, go. Get out of here.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:13.933
Go, go!

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100
Stoick, no!

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.644
Dad, he won't hurt you!

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:20.689
No, don't! You're
only making it worse!

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:22.816
Toothless, stop!

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:26.445
No! No!

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.075
Get him!

01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:36.664
No, no! Please just
don't hurt him!

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.791
Please don't hurt him.

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:47.258
Put it with the others.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.513
I should have known. I
should have seen the signs.

01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:54.515
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:58.727
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:02.314
So everything in the ring, a trick?
A lie?

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:06.610
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:10.322
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but
please, just don't hurt Toothless.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:13.659
The dragon? That's what
you're worried about?

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.536
Not the people you
almost killed?

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:18.122
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.291
They've killed hundreds of us!

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.167
And we've killed
thousands of them!

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:27.590
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:31.594
If they don't bring enough food
back, they'll be eaten themselves.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:36.056
There's something else on their island.
It's a dragon like...

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:38.976
Their island? So you've
been to the nest?

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:40.936
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.647
What? No, I didn't.
Toothless did.

01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:46.525
Only a dragon can
find the island.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.988
No, no, no. No, Dad. No, please,
it's not what you think.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:54.199
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:58.287
Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.497
No, Dad. No.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:03.626
For once in your life, would
you please just listen to me?!

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.175
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.

01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:15.304
You're not my son.

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:19.767
Ready the ships!

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.988
This way.

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.865
Set sail!

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.618
We head for Helheim's Gate.

01:07:28.128 --> 01:07:30.462
Lead us home, devil.

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.860
It's a mess.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:57.448
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:

01:07:57.615 --> 01:08:00.492
Your father, your tribe,
your best friend.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.828
Thank you for summing that up.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:08.167
Why couldn't I have killed that
dragon when I found him in the woods?

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:12.629
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.340
So why didn't you?

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.804
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.682
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.143
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.520
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.200
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak.

01:08:32.212 --> 01:08:34.734
I wouldn't kill a dragon.

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:36.153
You said "wouldn't".

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.488
Whatever! I wouldn't!

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:42.533
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.957
First one to ride one, though.

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:52.419
So?

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:58.759
I wouldn't kill him because he
looked as frightened as I was.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:03.430
I looked at him
and I saw myself.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:09.937
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:15.901
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:19.529
Then something crazy.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.533
That's more like it.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.252
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.921
- Here!
- One length to your stern.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.301
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:46.098
are wondering what it is we're up to here.
Not me, of course.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.767
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:52.437
not me, are wondering if there
is in fact a plan at all

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:56.233
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:58.527
Of course. Send them running.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.446
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.040
Step aside.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.513
Bear to port.

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:35.814
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:40.986
You were wise to seek help from
the world's most deadly weapon.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.154
It's me.

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:44.698
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.743
You're crazy. I like that.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.579
So, what is the plan?

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.507
That's not really encouraging.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.970
I was wondering where that went.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:22.194
Stay low and ready your weapons.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.169
We're here.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.621
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.999
It's OK. It's OK.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.678
Where are you going?

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.472
You'll need something
to help you hold on.

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:45.736
When we crack this Mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:48.864
In my undies. Good thing
I brought extras.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:52.284
No matter how this
ends, it ends today.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.007
Is that it?

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.013
We've done it!

01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:08.068
This isn't over! Form your ranks!
Hold together!

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.874
Get clear!

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:34.928
Beard of Thor! What is that?!

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:41.017
Odin help us.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:46.898
Catapults!

01:14:56.576 --> 01:14:58.952
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.758
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.094
Lead the men to the far
side of the island!

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:17.429
Gobber, go with the men!

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:20.557
I think I'll stay, in case your
thinking of doing something crazy.

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:23.852
I can buy them a few minutes if I
give that thing someone to hunt!

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.562
Then I can double that time.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:31.610
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:44.915
Come on! Fight me!

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.958
No, me!

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.800
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.136
Move, Fishlegs!

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:02.140
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:06.102
Up! Let's move it!

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:11.024
Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.444
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:17.405
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.563
Steer clear of both. Small
eyes, large nostrils!

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.576
Relies on hearing and smell!

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:25.121
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind
spot, make noise, keep it confused!

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:29.000
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has
a shot limit! Make it mad!

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.543
That's my specialty!

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:34.005
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:37.425
Just do what I told you! I'll
be back as soon as I can!

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:40.345
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:50.397
- Troll!
- Butt elf!

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:52.107
Bride of Grendel!

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.365
This thing doesn't
have a blind spot!

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160
There!

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:13.795
Go help the others!

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.048
OK, hold on. Hold on.

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:23.471
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:36.484
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.448
I'm OK!

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.074
Less OK!

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:49.456
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.337
Yeah! You're the Viking!

01:18:33.084 --> 01:18:34.209
Dad?

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.396
You got it, bud.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.358
Hiccup!

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:04.072
I'm sorry... for everything.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.573
Yeah. Me, too.

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.617
You don't have to go up there.

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:11.663
We're Vikings. It's an
occupational hazard.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.000
I'm proud to call you my son.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.420
Thanks, Dad.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:25.802
He's up!

01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:30.223
Get Snotlout out of there.

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:31.641
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.370
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:34.978
No, this way.

01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:37.355
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!

01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.153
I can't believe that worked!

01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:51.703
Night Fury!

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:53.621
Get down!

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.549
Did you get her?

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.060
Go.

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:20.607
That thing has wings. OK,
let's see if it can use them!

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:38.583
You think that did it?

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.256
Well, he can fly.

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.821
OK, Toothless,
time to disappear.

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:10.240
Come on, bud!

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:17.956
Here it comes!

01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:11.634
Watch out!

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:16.139
OK, time's up! Let's
see if this works.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.935
Come on! Is that the
best you can do?!

01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:41.205
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:47.503
Hold, Toothless.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.422
Now!

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:14.530
No.

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:16.407
No!

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:32.632
Hiccup!

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:38.805
Son!

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:42.934
Hiccup.

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:06.374
Oh, son.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.419
I did this.

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:42.493
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

01:24:49.168 --> 01:24:50.168
Hiccup!

01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:59.969
He's alive. You brought
him back alive.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:19.906
Thank you for saving my son.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:23.701
Well, you know... most of him.

01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:43.596
Hey, Toothless.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:46.724
I'm happy to see you, too.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:52.480
I'm in my house.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:55.483
You're in my house.

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:57.401
Does my Dad know you're here?

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.737
What? OK, OK.

01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:02.323
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.617
Toothless! Oh, come on.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.867
OK. Thanks, bud.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:27:00.089
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:01.507
Hold on tight! Here we go!

01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:05.887
What?

01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:16.355
I knew it. I'm dead.

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:21.485
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.321
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.990
It's Hiccup!

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:31.662
Turns out all we needed was
a little more of this.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:33.915
You just gestured to all of me.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.127
Well, most of you. That
bit's my handiwork.

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:41.797
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:44.258
I might make a few tweaks.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.970
That's for scaring me.

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:50.681
What is it always going to be this way?
'Cause...

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:54.810
...I could get used to it.

01:27:58.023 --> 01:27:59.857
Welcome home.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:02.318
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:14.455
You ready?

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.085
This is Berk.

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:23.339
It snows nine months of the
year and hails the other three.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.636
Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:33.307
The people that grow
here are even more so.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:39.313
The only upsides are the pets.

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:45.987
While other places have
ponies or parrots...

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.864
...we have...

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.325
...dragons.
