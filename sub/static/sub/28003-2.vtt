Hey.

14:59.106 --> 14:59.940
You know, it's funny.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.192
I've had the same routine
for the last four years.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.987
Now that I'm back down here,
I'm not quite sure what to do with myself.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.281
-I know the feeling.
-[chuckles softly]

15:07.364 --> 15:09.408
Well, you must be eager to see Claire,
huh?

15:09.491 --> 15:12.620
I didn't think it was possible
to miss a person this much.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.332
But I've got some things I need to do
before I can see her.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.918
You know, someday I'd really...

15:19.835 --> 15:21.086
love for you to meet her.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.005
Me?

15:24.131 --> 15:25.925
Yeah, you. [chuckles]

15:26.008 --> 15:28.385
-Why not?
-Well, does Claire even know about me?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.221
What are you talking about?
Of course she knows about you.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.807
I know, it's just that,
when you left, it seemed like...

15:33.891 --> 15:36.727
all you wanted to do
was forget this place ever existed, so...

15:36.810 --> 15:38.395
This place, yes.

15:39.063 --> 15:39.980
But not you.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.657
When Claire was little,
I used to read her books about the moon.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.077
I'd tell her
her uncle was living up there.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.122
That he was... protecting us from harm.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.582
-[chuckles]
-Really?

15:59.249 --> 16:02.044
I mean, you were...
her own personal superhero.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.759
You know, after all this time,
I know she would love to meet you.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.850
Uh, Dad's monocle is still missing,
so I can't just forget about that.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.355
Dad died
because his heart gave out, Luther.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.984
Don't turn his death into a mission.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.821
Is that what you think this is?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.366
I think there's a reason
why you never left.

what you were saying.

-Maybe you were right to be dismissive.

time travel could contaminate the mind.

on the finer details,

27:35.236 --> 27:36.696
What? What are you talking about?

27:36.780 --> 27:40.450
I mean, was I really young when I had you?
Like, 16? Like, young and...

27:40.784 --> 27:42.952
-terribly misguided?
-Sure.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.663
Your mother, that slut.

27:44.996 --> 27:47.040
Whoever she was. We met at...

27:48.500 --> 27:51.628
the disco. [chuckles] Okay? Remember that.
-[snaps fingers]
-Oh, my God, the sex was amazing.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.384
What a disturbing glimpse
into that thing you call a brain.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.344
Don't make me put you in time-out.
[crickets chirping]

28:11.731 --> 28:12.607
[sighs]

28:13.817 --> 28:15.527
-[sirens wailing in distance]
-[keys jingle]

28:15.610 --> 28:17.612
-[beeps]
-[on recording] <i>Yo, Syd, it's Johnny.</i>

28:17.696 --> 28:21.616
<i>Hey, look, we got a bunch of extra tows</i>
<i>down here, down on Empire Avenue.</i>

28:21.700 --> 28:23.326
<i>The whole thing is a disaster.</i>

28:23.410 --> 28:24.828
<i>-Kids arrested.</i>
-[footsteps approach]

28:24.911 --> 28:27.288
<i>-Trucks as far as the eye can see.</i>
-[grunts, thuds]

28:27.997 --> 28:29.040
[grunting]

28:29.124 --> 28:31.835
You gotta tell me how you did
the London job in '66.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.545
Beautiful work. Really.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.839
I swear to Christ, I have no idea
what you're talking--

28:35.922 --> 28:37.632
-[machine clicks and hums loudly]
-[groans]

28:38.466 --> 28:40.218
[machine clicks and dies down]

28:40.301 --> 28:43.680
[crying] I am just a tow truck driver.
I've never even been to London.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.974
Tuna? Delicious. You want half?

28:46.349 --> 28:47.684
I'm fine, thanks.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.606
[groans]

28:53.690 --> 28:57.360
-That's for no mayo.
-[sobbing]

28:58.445 --> 29:01.072
Does Number Five seem
like he'd be a whimperer to you?

29:01.156 --> 29:02.323
Not from what I heard.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.870
-That seems close enough to me.
-Strong resemblance, I'll grant you that,

29:06.953 --> 29:09.205
but... the space
between the eyes is different,

29:09.289 --> 29:11.916
the chin is not quite the same.
There's a dimple.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.418
There <i>is </i>a dimple.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.378
I am not the guy that you are look--

29:15.462 --> 29:16.880
[machine clicks and hums]

29:16.963 --> 29:18.840
-[machine clicks and dies down]
-No talking.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.009
He was the only guy in the doughnut shop,
wasn't he?

29:21.092 --> 29:23.720
Was there anyone else in the doughnut shop
with you last night, Syd?

29:23.803 --> 29:26.306
I don't know, just the waitress
and some kid.

29:26.389 --> 29:30.018
-Some kid? Elaborate.
-I-- I don't know. Uh... He was weird.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.854
This isn't twenty questions, old man.
Weird how?

29:32.937 --> 29:37.525
[stammers] He said something
about coming there when he was young.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.905
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-Italian for dinner?

29:42.363 --> 29:44.657
Focus, I'm talking about the kid.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.951
-What about him?
-Time travel's a bitch.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.745
Especially without a briefcase.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.622
What if the kid is Number Five?

29:52.165 --> 29:53.833
It's sort of hard
to wrap your head around.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.586
You see, I told you, I am not the guy--

29:56.669 --> 29:59.714
-What else did you and the kid talk about?
-[Syd] I-- I think that's it.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.135
Oh, wait, wait, wait...
[stammers] What are you doing?

30:04.219 --> 30:06.596
-Jump-starting your memory.
-[Syd groaning]

30:08.014 --> 30:10.934
-[machine clicks and hums]
-[screams]

30:12.602 --> 30:15.480
-[machine clicks and dies down]
-All I remember is he wanted directions

30:15.563 --> 30:18.775
to some department store.
That’s it, I swear.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.486
Department store? Okay. Elaborate.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.655
[Syd panting]

30:24.948 --> 30:28.660
But I'm leaving for the airport.
It's not a big deal if I miss one session.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.747
Patrick, it was my father's funeral.
You know, I'm pretty sure

30:32.831 --> 30:35.583
the court recognizes that
as extenuating circumstances.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.169
-[footsteps descending stairs]
-Is Claire there?

30:39.921 --> 30:42.131
Yes, I would like to say hello
to my daughter

30:42.215 --> 30:43.675
if that's all right with you.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.011
No.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.097
[voice breaking] Patrick!

30:50.014 --> 30:51.391
Don't-- [sighs]

30:59.941 --> 31:00.817
Are you okay?

31:02.485 --> 31:04.863
[sighs] Yeah.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.199
Well,
I've never met your ex-husband, but...

31:10.493 --> 31:11.661
he sounds like an asshole.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.247
That's one word for it.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.166
You know what?
You're probably better off here.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.794
No, I'm probably better off
with my daughter.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.129
Of course, um...

31:21.629 --> 31:22.589
I'm sorry. I didn't--

31:22.672 --> 31:26.467
You know, if I wanted advice, Vanya,
no offense, it wouldn't be from you.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.638
-What is that supposed to mean?
-You don't have a child.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.224
-You've never even been in a relationship.
-That's not true.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.560
So you know what it's like
to love someone like this?

31:36.019 --> 31:38.980
Like when you're apart from her,
you can't breathe?

31:40.607 --> 31:43.943
Like you would-- you would die,
and I-- I mean actually...

31:44.611 --> 31:45.445
die...

31:46.863 --> 31:48.615
to know that she's okay and happy.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.285
You separate yourself
from everyone and everything.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.244
You always have.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.124
Because Dad made me.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.085
Did Dad make you write that book
about us, too?

32:10.303 --> 32:11.971
You're an adult now, Vanya.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.809
You don't get to blame your problems
on anyone but yourself.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.446
[doctor] Like I said to your son earlier,

32:28.529 --> 32:32.742
any information about the prosthetics
we build is strictly confidential.

32:32.825 --> 32:35.578
Without the client's consent,
I simply can't help you.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.623
Well, we can't get consent
if you don't give us a name.

32:39.123 --> 32:40.458
Well, that's not my problem.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.544
Sorry. Now, there's really nothing more
I can do, so--

32:43.628 --> 32:45.922
And what about <i>my</i> consent?

32:46.339 --> 32:49.592
-Excuse me?
-[Klaus] Who gave you permission...

32:50.259 --> 32:52.136
[crying] ...to lay your hands...

32:53.304 --> 32:54.430
on my son?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.308
-[both] What?
-[Klaus] You heard me.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.519
-I didn't touch your son.
-[Klaus] Oh, really?

33:00.186 --> 33:02.605
Well, then how did he get
that swollen lip, then?

33:03.272 --> 33:04.691
He doesn't have a swollen--

33:04.941 --> 33:06.609
-[Five grunts]
-[gasps]

33:06.693 --> 33:09.779
[inhales sharply]
I want it. Name, please. Now.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.407
-You're crazy.
-[chuckles]

33:12.740 --> 33:14.409
You got no idea.

33:17.078 --> 33:20.081
"Peace on Earth." That's so sweet.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.042
[Klaus groans]

33:23.418 --> 33:24.460
[yells]

33:25.712 --> 33:27.130
God, that hurt!

33:29.424 --> 33:30.717
I'm calling secur-- [grunts]

33:30.800 --> 33:34.095
-What are you doing?
-[gasps] There's been an assault...

33:34.387 --> 33:38.599
in Mr. Big's office,
and we need security, now. Schnell!

33:38.766 --> 33:40.184
-[receiver clatters]
-[sighs]

33:41.310 --> 33:43.104
Now, here's what's gonna happen, Grant.

33:43.604 --> 33:45.023
It's... Lance.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.315
[Klaus] In about 60 seconds,

33:46.399 --> 33:48.359
two security guards are gonna burst
through that door,

33:48.443 --> 33:50.111
and they're gonna see
a whole lot of blood,

33:50.194 --> 33:52.405
and they're gonna wonder,
"What the hell happened?"

33:52.488 --> 33:54.490
And we're gonna tell them that <i>you...</i>

33:55.825 --> 33:58.536
[crying] ...beat the shit out of us.

33:58.619 --> 34:01.581
[sobs dramatically, sighs]

34:02.290 --> 34:04.917
You're gonna do great in prison, Grant.
Trust me, I've been there.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.420
Little piece of chicken like you.

34:07.503 --> 34:10.131
Oh, my God, you're gonna get passed around
like a...

34:10.840 --> 34:13.217
You're just-- You're gonna do great.
That's all I'm saying.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.595
Jesus, you are a real sick bastard.

34:16.512 --> 34:17.346
Thank you.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.266
-[spits]
-[shard of glass clinks]

34:27.648 --> 34:29.400
-Oh, that's strange.
-What?

34:29.817 --> 34:32.445
Uh, the eye.
It hasn't been purchased by a client yet.

34:32.528 --> 34:33.821
What? What do you mean?

34:33.905 --> 34:37.825
Well, uh, our logs say that the eye
with that serial number...

34:38.826 --> 34:41.871
This can't be right.
It hasn't even been manufactured yet.

34:42.622 --> 34:44.040
Where did you get that eye?

34:45.124 --> 34:46.209
[sighs]

34:47.293 --> 34:48.461
[Five] <i>Well, this is not good.</i>

34:48.544 --> 34:52.215
[Klaus] I was pretty good, though, right?
"Yeah. What about <i>my </i>consent, bitch?"

34:52.298 --> 34:53.257
[chuckles]

34:53.341 --> 34:55.134
[Five] Klaus, it doesn't matter.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.346
What? What?
What's the big deal with this eye, anyway?

34:58.805 --> 35:00.890
There is someone out there
who's going to lose an eye

35:00.973 --> 35:02.141
in the next seven days.

35:02.225 --> 35:05.269
They're gonna bring about the end
of life on this Earth as we know it.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.981
Yeah, can I get that 20 bucks, like, now,
or what?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.066
Your 20 bucks?

35:10.149 --> 35:11.526
[Klaus] Yeah, my 20 bucks.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.985
The apocalypse is coming,

35:13.069 --> 35:14.946
and all you can think about
is getting high?

35:15.154 --> 35:17.240
Well, I'm also quite hungry.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.826
Tummy's a-rumblin'. [imitates groaning]

35:20.827 --> 35:21.828
You're useless.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.955
-You're all useless!
-[Klaus] Oh, come on.

35:24.288 --> 35:26.249
You need to lighten up, old man.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.043
[sighs]

35:29.335 --> 35:33.589
Hey, you know, I've just now realized
why you're so uptight.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.217
You must be horny as hell! [laughs]

35:36.843 --> 35:39.262
All those years by yourself.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.806
It's gotta screw with your head,
being alone.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.142
Well...

35:44.809 --> 35:45.643
I wasn't alone.

35:47.019 --> 35:47.895
Oh?

35:48.479 --> 35:49.313
Pray tell.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.108
Her name was Delores.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.988
We were together for over 30 years.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.867
Thirty years? Oh, wow! [chuckles]

36:00.950 --> 36:03.327
God, the longest
I've been with someone was...

36:03.995 --> 36:05.496
I don't know, three weeks.

36:05.580 --> 36:09.417
And that's only because I was
so tired of looking for a place to sleep.

36:10.710 --> 36:14.755
He did make the most fantastic
<i>osso buco, </i>though. It was...

36:17.341 --> 36:18.176
Five?

36:18.843 --> 36:21.220
-[gasps]
-Don't stop. Just keep going.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.268
[shouting] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what about my money?

36:27.894 --> 36:30.438
[playing a mournful tune]

36:40.364 --> 36:41.699
[loud knock at door]

36:43.034 --> 36:44.911
He's not here, Mrs. Kowalski.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.955
[loud knocking continues]

36:52.960 --> 36:54.378
Mr. Puddles isn't here.

36:57.048 --> 36:57.924
Can I help you?

36:58.674 --> 36:59.508
I'm Leonard.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.053
I'm your four o’clock.

37:02.762 --> 37:06.098
Oh, my... I forgot. I am so sorry.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.392
I swear I had nothing to do
with Mr. Puddles.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.602
Oh, no...

37:10.311 --> 37:12.563
Sorry, it's, uh, my neighbor,
Mrs. Kowalski.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.941
She... Well, she has this cat
that always goes missing.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.943
She thinks I know where it is. I don't.

37:17.026 --> 37:17.860
She's older.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.113
And I should stop... talking.
I'm so sorry. Please come in.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.621
-[lock clicks]
-[chuckles softly]

37:30.331 --> 37:33.626
I'm guessing I look different...
than your usual students.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.128
-Um, yeah, you can just...
-Yeah.
-Yeah, 20 years or so different.
-[both chuckle]

37:39.465 --> 37:41.884
Well, the ad didn't say anything
about age limits.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.346
No, no, of course not.
It's... most of my students are kids.

37:45.638 --> 37:49.058
Easier to learn music when you're young.
You know, like a second language.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.351
<i>Ich verstehe!</i>

37:52.311 --> 37:54.689
That's German... for "I understand."

37:55.690 --> 37:57.650
I took three years of that in high school.

37:57.733 --> 38:00.027
-And that's all I can remember.
-Mm.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.532
Well, it's right over here.

38:04.615 --> 38:05.449
If you wanna...

38:06.701 --> 38:08.828
Let me just... Sorry...

38:08.911 --> 38:11.789
-Oh, it's fine.
-...get organized for a second.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.293
[Leonard] Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

38:16.961 --> 38:17.920
Ah.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.215
-[discordant note]
-[Vanya] Oh!

38:21.299 --> 38:22.717
[Leonard chuckles]

38:22.800 --> 38:24.385
-You're really just going for it.
-Yeah.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.470
[Vanya] Um, no, I'll actually take that.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.140
And we're just gonna start
with the basics.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.184
-[loud music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

38:33.519 --> 38:36.314
-[man] What's up? Hey, Diego.
-[Diego] Yo. What up, Nigel?

38:38.524 --> 38:40.067
[woman] What's up, Diego?

38:41.777 --> 38:43.529
-[Diego] Doing good, huh?
-[man] <i>Sí.</i>

38:44.405 --> 38:46.407
[men grunting]

38:58.002 --> 38:59.170
[Diego gasps]

39:25.112 --> 39:27.114

-[both chuckle]

41:33.491 --> 41:34.408
You can be honest.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.537

wanting to learn violin this late in life?

41:38.662 --> 41:40.122
No, no.

41:40.414 --> 41:44.210

until his forties.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.504

41:47.630 --> 41:50.341
No, if you love music,
then you're in the right place.

my dad more than me.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.180
He was the music lover.

41:57.139 --> 41:58.516
It's kind of why I'm here.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.476
He passed away a while ago.

42:00.559 --> 42:01.685
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:01.769 --> 42:05.397
Oh, no, it's fine.
We had a complicated relationship.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.108
Didn't really get each other, you know?

42:08.359 --> 42:11.654
But he loved violin,
and that was not my thing.
So I guess I'm here
to... understand him better,

42:15.574 --> 42:16.909
