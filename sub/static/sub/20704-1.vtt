00:14.806 --> 00:18.060
First of all,
thank you so much for doing this.

00:18.143 --> 00:21.021
I know you're busy.
I was kind of embarrassed to ask you.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.523
What do you need, exactly?
Because I'm...

00:24.358 --> 00:26.193
Um, I want you to...

00:26.276 --> 00:28.195
- You're gonna look into the camera.
- Right.

00:28.278 --> 00:31.073
Get the audience really psyched up
to see me, a nice introduction.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.492
Just get them really juiced
to have me coming out.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.827
"Ladies and gentlemen,

00:35.911 --> 00:37.913
you are in the for the night
of your lives.

00:37.996 --> 00:41.583
This next comedian makes Jerry Seinfeld
and Chris Rock look like rubbish.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.962
George Carlin and Richard Pryor were shit
compared to him.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.215
Please welcome the greatest comedian
- Jim Norton."

00:48.298 --> 00:52.177
Nah, it's just too much.
It's a little over the top.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.804
- Is it?
- Yeah, too much.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.014
- Oh.
- Kind of hard to believe all that.

00:56.098 --> 00:59.643
Well, yeah. I was trying to big you up.
So...

00:59.726 --> 01:02.854
Something a little bit less
pressure-inducing.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.232
Right, okay. You don't want pressure.
I'm sorry.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.150
I didn't realize you didn't want pressure

01:07.234 --> 01:09.695
when doing a special on Netflix

01:09.778 --> 01:12.155
that's gonna be seen
by millions of people.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.907
But you don't want pressure.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.492
- It should feel honest.
- Honest?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.912
- Honest is important.
- Okay. Honest. Yeah, honest.

01:18.996 --> 01:23.041
"Please give it up
for the dirty, disgusting,

01:23.125 --> 01:26.962
depraved little peeled turtle with AIDS,

01:27.045 --> 01:31.133
the king of cum-guzzling himself,
Mr. Jim Norton."

01:33.969 --> 01:36.596
- Too honest?
- Yeah? Sorry.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.021
Hey, buddy. I've got a favor to ask you.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.774
I'm shooting a special, and I'm looking
for someone to introduce me,

01:47.858 --> 01:49.610
and I would love it to be you.

01:49.693 --> 01:53.155
You'd just kind of say something nice
about me and bring me onstage.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.781
If that would...

01:54.865 --> 01:57.075
Look, I appreciate you doing this,

01:57.159 --> 02:00.370
but it just doesn't seem
like you really mean any of it.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.122
You don't believe what I just said?

02:05.876 --> 02:08.794
Ladies and gentlemen, coming up
to the stage sometime soon,

02:08.878 --> 02:10.839
in a little while, is Jim Norton.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.800
- See? Right there. It's no good.
- What do you mean?

02:13.884 --> 02:16.428
You don't sound like you mean it.
You've got to say it with conviction.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.221
You're telling me how to deliver lines?

02:18.889 --> 02:22.976
Your goal here is to get people
really happy and excited to see me.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.395
I'm an actor. I'm not a fucking magician.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.440
You don't like the way I did that? Huh?

02:28.523 --> 02:29.983
I didn't say I didn't like it.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.986
Stop being so nervous.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.613
Do it again,
you fucking nervous little prick.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.697
Go ahead, do it again.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.200
- Your motivation should be...
- My motivation?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.409
Should be...

02:39.493 --> 02:42.996
Now say it again with conviction,
you ugly little slug.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.499
Your motivation should be...

02:45.582 --> 02:47.793
You dirty, nervous prick!

02:48.752 --> 02:51.171
Jimmy, come on! You can do it!

02:51.963 --> 02:54.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
do me a fucking favor

02:54.716 --> 02:58.261
and please welcome Jim Norton!

03:09.314 --> 03:12.734
<i>♪ The world today
Is such a wicked place ♪</i>

03:14.945 --> 03:18.782
<i>♪ Fighting going on
Between the human race... ♪</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:19.866
Thank you.

03:25.622 --> 03:29.376
Thank you very much for coming.
I really appreciate you being here.

03:29.876 --> 03:30.919
How about that?

03:37.092 --> 03:40.178
Robert De Niro spanked my bare ass.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.975
I was sick the day we shot that,
and my whole fear, I was like,

03:45.058 --> 03:48.228
"Please, don't shit on his hand.
Don't shit on his hand."

03:49.438 --> 03:53.358
Look, I have a decent comedy career.
I'm doing stand-up over 20 years.

03:53.442 --> 03:58.196
I'm not mainstream famous, obviously.
Kevin Hart is mainstream famous.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.575
I have the type of fame where people
will see me, and they kind of...

04:01.658 --> 04:03.618
Sometimes they know
they've seen me somewhere,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.287
but they're not sure where.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.788
It's never attractive women.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.915
Even if they know me, they don't say it,
'cause they're not sure.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.668
"Did I see him on stage somewhere,
or did he follow me home?"

04:11.752 --> 04:12.878
I always have that...

04:14.171 --> 04:16.173
"Did I see him on <i>Louie</i>
or in my bushes?"

04:20.093 --> 04:21.928
But I don't know what you know
about comedians,

04:22.012 --> 04:25.265
but there's nothing we hate more
than some random guy going,

04:25.348 --> 04:27.184
"Dude, where do I know you from?"

04:27.267 --> 04:29.686
The last thing I want to say is,
"I'm a comedian.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.064
Oh, don't pick on me.
I'm gonna use you in my act, buster.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.483
Come on, let's sit down."

04:36.943 --> 04:40.280
It's repulsive. So, whenever someone says,
"Where do I know you from,"

04:40.363 --> 04:42.491
I'll usually go,
"I think I sucked your dick.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.370
You like it down to the root, right?
You like it down to the root?

04:47.454 --> 04:50.707
Two fingers in the ass,
thumb on the balls. I know you.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.502
Don't get mad, dude. I thought it was you.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.129
Maybe it was your dad.
He looked like you. I apologize.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.300
Don't get mad.
You tell me, do I look familiar?"

05:10.143 --> 05:12.604
I feel so good.
I'm happy to be shooting in New York.

05:12.687 --> 05:16.733
It's nice to be back home.
And I feel rested. I'm always tired.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.486
I fell asleep last night, got eight hours,

05:19.569 --> 05:24.324
had an amazing dream that Kim Kardashian
was sitting on my face

05:24.407 --> 05:25.909
and just grinding.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.913
Well, but then I woke up and realized
my nose was just stuffy.

05:33.208 --> 05:36.336
I like a fat ass
more than a white guy is supposed to.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.297
Black guys are supposed to like fat asses,

05:39.381 --> 05:41.049
but I really like a big, fat ass.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.593
But I tend to date small women.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.680
So, it's awful when I see a big, fat ass
if I'm with a small girl,

05:46.763 --> 05:49.266
and they're like, "That's disgusting."
Then I have to kind of sell out.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.226
"Yeah, it's terrible.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.770
Oh, that would feel awful,
those birthing hips.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.148
I'd hate to hold onto those and slide in.
Ugh!

05:58.191 --> 06:00.735
Oh, her pussy would probably grip you
like the mouth in <i>Aliens.</i>

06:00.819 --> 06:02.404
Oh, disgusting!

06:03.613 --> 06:07.367
How awful,
that soft flesh bouncing back against you.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.037
I like your skeletal hips.
That's what I like, your skeletal...

06:11.788 --> 06:14.958
Ass like a leukemia patient.
That's what turns me on.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.128
Oh, I love it when you turn around
and go..."

06:27.679 --> 06:29.806
I got into a fight recently.
I don't fight a lot.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.434
I'm not a big guy,
so I really don't fight very much.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.520
But I have a big mouth.
I won my fight, though.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.148
I actually won the fight that I got into.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.651
It was a guy.
He was a little drunk, I think.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.529
He was in a store,
and I just overheard him,

06:44.613 --> 06:46.323
and I couldn't help myself.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.907
He had a fedora on.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.077
And he's talking to the salesgirl,

06:51.161 --> 06:53.371
and he's like, "What do you think
I should wear with this?"

06:53.455 --> 06:54.831
And I said, "A rope."

07:01.212 --> 07:03.590
Which is actually
very sound fashion advice.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.718
But he grabbed my shirt.
That's why I think he was drunk.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.471
He grabbed my shirt, and he's like,
"What did you say?"

07:09.554 --> 07:11.681
And I was like, "I'm gonna cum."

07:19.397 --> 07:21.232
Then he gave up immediately.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.319
Too late, unfortunately.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.993
Guys are so homophobic.
It's really funny to me.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.956
We use a homophobic thing
to make each other uncomfortable,

07:36.039 --> 07:37.958
to dominate each other
when we're growing up.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.670
You remember ten or 11 years old,
you'd be sitting at your friend's house,

07:41.753 --> 07:43.463
watching TV in the living room,

07:43.546 --> 07:47.550
and then he'd just walk in out of nowhere
and start humping the side of your face?

07:48.635 --> 07:49.803
Remember?

08:05.276 --> 08:07.904
I still do shit like that.
It's still fun to fuck with your friends.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.241
I walked into a public restroom,
and a buddy of mine was at the urinal,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.743
and you gotta do something
when your friend's at the urinal.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.830
You just gotta fuck with him a little bit.
He didn't hear me walk in,

08:16.913 --> 08:21.918
so I snuck up behind him very quietly
and I stood about an inch behind him,

08:22.002 --> 08:26.297
and then I put my mouth right behind
his neck hair, and I just went...

08:26.381 --> 08:28.383
"Hey!"

08:31.553 --> 08:34.931
And he freaked out,
and it wasn't my friend.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.062
Yet.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.233
Do you know how hard that is
to explain to a stranger,

08:45.316 --> 08:47.610
why you just spoke onto his neck?

08:51.406 --> 08:54.325
Oh, man. I feel great.
I feel really, really good.

08:54.409 --> 08:58.621
Life has just been good lately.
And it's so funny,

08:58.705 --> 09:01.374
'cause you find things you like
as you get older.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.794
I'm in my 40's now, so you find shit
that makes you feel good.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.048
Like, I have a hatred
of somebody telling me a story,

09:08.131 --> 09:11.634
and at one point in the story, you know
how they ask you to guess at part of...

09:11.718 --> 09:13.386
It's usually because the story is shit,

09:13.470 --> 09:17.682
and they think that your guess
will propel their story into interesting.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.310
They'll say, "Guess how many?"
Then you guess the number,

09:20.393 --> 09:21.770
and then they tell you the real number,

09:21.853 --> 09:24.147
and you're like, "Holy shit!
I should've guessed..."

09:25.732 --> 09:27.901
I've begun over-guessing on purpose

09:27.984 --> 09:30.737
just to totally destroy the momentum
of the story.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.866
Once you do it, you'll never not do it.
And I know I'm a piece of shit

09:34.949 --> 09:37.285
for robbing little victories
from all my friends.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.204
Fuck them. Their stories are terrible.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.292
My manager Jonathan... I love him,
but he does this to me all the time.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.670
He bought a watch,
and he paid 1,500 bucks for the watch.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.549
And if he had just said, "I paid 1,500
for this watch, but it's worth 2,000,"

09:51.633 --> 09:53.009
I would've been impressed.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.845
I would've been like,
"Oh, cool, you saved 500 bucks."

09:55.929 --> 09:59.390
But he tried to have,
like, a "holy shit" moment with it.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.184
He's like,
"Dude, I paid 1,500 for this watch.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.560
Guess how much it's worth."

10:04.187 --> 10:06.564
"I don't know.
A hundred-and-thirty-thousand?"

10:11.736 --> 10:13.696
And I'm still giddy at the memory

10:13.780 --> 10:17.200
of that stupid fucking smile
melting off his face.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.913
'Cause now his real number
has no impact whatsoever.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.918
Like, I guessed 130,000.
He can't go, "No. 2,000."

10:27.001 --> 10:29.879
"Oh, hey,
that's a heck of a savings, too!"

10:31.673 --> 10:34.259
Fucking shoot yourself.
Your story was terrible.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.889
And I started doing it...
It's weird. I begun...

10:39.973 --> 10:43.309
The joy of over-guessing,
I discovered by accident.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.521
I was trying to do the right thing.
A friend of mine is really fat.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.732
Wouldn't it be great
if I just left it right there?

10:49.816 --> 10:52.068
"A friend of mine is fat"
and moved on to something else.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.487
Like, that was just me talking to him.
"You know who you are."

10:57.323 --> 11:00.535
A friend of mine is really fat.
He started losing weight, which was great,

11:00.618 --> 11:03.538
but instead of just letting
somebody notice it,

11:03.621 --> 11:06.624
he told us that he lost weight,
which was kind of awkward

11:06.708 --> 11:08.168
'cause it wasn't really noticeable yet.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.837
He's like, "Dude, I lost some weight."
In my mind, I'm like, "Allegedly."

11:10.920 --> 11:12.839
I didn't see evidence of that at all.

11:15.466 --> 11:19.262
But then he puts me on the spot.
He's like, "Guess how many pounds."

11:19.345 --> 11:22.724
And I don't want to be a scumbag.
"Uh, point..."

11:25.894 --> 11:29.564
So, in an effort to be nice,
I over-guessed. I was like, "50?"

11:29.647 --> 11:31.858
He was like, "No. Six."

11:33.776 --> 11:35.695
And I realized that by over-guessing,

11:35.778 --> 11:39.324
I had totally robbed him of that moment
and made him feel horrible.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.451
And it made me so fucking happy.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.205
I feel so good.
I don't know how to handle feeling...

11:46.289 --> 11:49.459
I don't know how to live feeling good.
I'm so not used to it.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.170
I go through my depression, though,
like everybody else.

11:52.253 --> 11:56.215
I go through my feeling like shit.
You ever get suicidal thoughts? Anybody?

11:56.299 --> 11:57.717
Oh, yeah.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.679
That was a very fast...
Whenever you say "suicidal thoughts,"

12:01.763 --> 12:03.848
you never want the answer
to be that quick.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.183
"Yes!"

12:06.976 --> 12:09.020
Hope you're not on a first date.
That's the wrong time.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.481
"I've wanted to kill myself
and everyone else in the theater."

12:11.564 --> 12:12.690
Oh, good. That's...

12:15.777 --> 12:18.863
But it's weird how sneaky it is
and how it hits you out of nowhere.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.114
You're not prepared for it.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.241
Things are great, then all of a sudden,
your voice, like...

12:22.325 --> 12:24.243
"You forgot to hang yourself."
"What?"

12:26.621 --> 12:29.666
I'm not trying to bum everybody out.
It goes away in six months.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.047
And I don't want to kill myself,

12:36.130 --> 12:39.217
but I've kind of come
to a peaceful conclusion,

12:39.300 --> 12:43.638
that if I ever do decide to kill myself,
I'm gonna go out in style.

12:43.721 --> 12:48.685
And before I do it, I want to write a note
blaming someone I hardly know.

12:54.857 --> 12:59.112
How hilarious would that be, just to wreck
somebody's life for no reason whatsoever?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.864
But it's got to be totally random.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.743
Pick some guy at work
you've talked to once in eight years.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.955
Not even a guy from your department.
Just make it, you know...

13:09.038 --> 13:11.499
"Murray in Human Resources
will know what this is about."

13:12.125 --> 13:13.668
And fucking hang yourself.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.425
For the rest of his life, Murray will be
all fucked up and socially awkward.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.469
"I don't know.
I said hi to the guy once in 2014."

13:29.434 --> 13:32.979
I'm a terrible liar.
I'm a very, very bad liar.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.313
And I wish I was better,

13:34.397 --> 13:36.691
'cause it's hard for me
to be good in relationships.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.986
So, the fact is,
I just give myself away when I'm lying.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.156
I always feel like it's obvious.
Some guys are literally masters of lying.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.284
Your girl could walk in
and catch you fucking one of her friends.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.286
"What are you doing?"
"She fell, baby. I was picking her up."

13:48.369 --> 13:52.040
Just so smooth.
And I admire your ability to do that,

13:52.123 --> 13:54.125
because I just... my eyes get wide.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.628
I sound like an actor from the 1940s
if I'm texting the wrong person.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.089
"Who is that?"
"It's a buddy, see? Ahh."

14:02.884 --> 14:04.677
Fucking throw the phone into the tub.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.929
"Nothing to see there, chum. Ahh."

14:10.933 --> 14:13.352
Have you ever been such a bad liar

14:13.436 --> 14:15.813
that you try to lie
by just telling the truth

14:15.897 --> 14:18.024
with a sarcastic inflection in your voice,

14:18.107 --> 14:20.151
'cause it feels less like a lie?

14:20.234 --> 14:21.861
Like, if your girlfriend knows
you cheated on her.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.029
"Did you have sex with her?"

14:23.112 --> 14:24.364
"Yeah!

14:25.907 --> 14:29.160
Oh, yeah, yeah. I fucked her twice
while you were in the hospital."

14:33.831 --> 14:36.042
That reads pretty honest in a transcript.

14:43.299 --> 14:47.678
My ex-girlfriend caught me.
I got busted so badly.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.431
Has anybody ever gotten busted talking
to someone you shouldn't be?

14:50.515 --> 14:53.643
Because it's in black-and-white...

14:53.726 --> 14:54.852
Here's what it was.

14:55.937 --> 14:59.148
One morning, I was having
a nasty conversation with a girl,

14:59.232 --> 15:00.691
who I had met one time.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.193
And that's what we do now
in the digital era.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.530
You talk to people who you probably
wouldn't talk to before,

15:05.613 --> 15:06.989
because you can just do it
on your cell phone.

15:07.073 --> 15:12.495
And it was one of those three-hour,
lathered-up, fucking filthy...

15:12.578 --> 15:16.666
I was offering her $500 to come over
and stick her feet in my mouth.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.252
Which, you know, obviously,
I would never do that.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.004
Three-fifty is the cutoff
for foot worship. Everybody knows that.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.258
But I was talking to this girl Maria.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.718
And again, we'd never hung out.
We'd only met one time.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.304
But it was a three-hour...

15:30.388 --> 15:33.599
I was so finished.
I just jerked off and fell asleep.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.435
I didn't even clean up
until the next morning.

15:35.518 --> 15:39.021
Literally, I sounded like a Fruit Roll-Up
when I was pulling my...

15:46.696 --> 15:49.240
This is 2011.
I remember this like it was yesterday,

15:49.323 --> 15:52.368
'cause my girlfriend at the time walked
into the bedroom,

15:52.452 --> 15:54.996
and she goes, "Get up, Jim."

15:55.913 --> 15:58.291
You know how you know you're fucked
for some...

15:58.374 --> 16:00.960
The tone of voice implies
this is not gonna be great news.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.796
"Get up, Jim." I'm like, "What?"

16:03.880 --> 16:06.215
I don't know why that was my impression
of myself waking up.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.050
"Wha..." I don't talk like that.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.635
See, I overact, even in real life.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.970
"Wha..."

16:12.346 --> 16:13.931
I'm like, "What?" And she says,

16:14.015 --> 16:17.268
"I know about your fucking conversation
with Maria last night."

16:17.351 --> 16:19.479
And I'm a little freaked out,
but I look over,

16:19.562 --> 16:22.482
and my phone is exactly where I left it
the night before.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.025
I'm like, "I don't know
what you're talking about."

16:24.108 --> 16:27.487
She's like, "$500 to lick her feet,
you piece of shit?"

16:28.196 --> 16:31.741
So, now I know she knows.
Either that or she's an amazing guesser.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.998
But I wish I would've improv'd
that line I did before:

16:39.081 --> 16:40.750
"Hey, I wouldn't go over 350
for foot worship."

16:40.833 --> 16:44.295
Ha ha! Elbowed her.
Ohh, we'd have made love.

16:45.296 --> 16:48.382
But I knew I was caught somehow.
I didn't know how she knew.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.092
But you know how it is
when you get caught.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.470
I'm just like, "I'm sorry.
I'm a sex addict. I don't know."

16:52.553 --> 16:54.639
There's no way to fish for information

16:54.722 --> 16:56.432
when you're trying
to save your relationship.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.228
I couldn't go, "Baby, I love you.
How did you know, for future reference?"

17:04.690 --> 17:07.108
Here's how she knew.
She told me how she knew.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.694
'Cause none of us are as smart
as we think we are.

17:09.779 --> 17:13.156
None of us understand the technology
as well as we think we do.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.536
And we're all on Wi-Fi,
and all the devices are connected.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.663
And I was in this chat,
and I'm lathered up.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.999
I only have one hand to use on the phone,
obviously.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.125
I hit the wrong button

17:23.209 --> 17:26.921
and I printed the entire conversation
in the living room...

17:27.003 --> 17:29.382
a seven-page PDF file.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.096
Clear, too,
'cause I'd just put in fresh ink.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.556
It was very readable.

17:38.975 --> 17:43.521
And by a terrible coincidence,
she needed the printer the next morning,

17:43.604 --> 17:46.274
'cause she was taking a college course
at the time.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.817
She was very advanced for her age.

17:50.945 --> 17:54.657
So, she takes this conversation out
of the printer,

17:54.740 --> 18:00.037
and the paper she wrote,
and she heads off to class with this.

18:00.121 --> 18:04.792
And this is absolutely the truth.
Thank God she didn't hand it in.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.294
'Cause she was crazy.

18:06.377 --> 18:09.880
I firmly believe she would've woken me up
by putting a knife in my stomach.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.090
She would not have been...

18:11.173 --> 18:14.176
But it would've been a funnier joke.
There's no funny part.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.346
It would've been a much cleverer joke
if she had handed it in, and I would've...

18:17.430 --> 18:19.724
"I got an A. She got a C. Hey-oh!"

18:25.396 --> 18:27.398
The truth itself is not funny.
It's just sad.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.609
The way it played out was
she read the text,

18:29.692 --> 18:31.569
and she felt really betrayed,
and she cried.

18:32.737 --> 18:33.738
You know?

18:35.781 --> 18:38.492
That's what I'll do.
I'll jazz it up with one of those.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.411
"Got a lot of..." you know?

18:42.788 --> 18:43.914
But I kind of regret it.

18:43.998 --> 18:47.501
You've got to be so careful what you say
and what you put in text,

18:47.585 --> 18:50.755
because this day and age, anything you do
can fucking ruin your life.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.007
You've got to be so scared
of every text you send,

18:53.090 --> 18:56.177
every dirty picture you send,
everything you put on Snapchat.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.138
I mean, I'll tell you
who has struck a blow for privacy.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.390
Hulk Hogan did more for privacy

19:01.474 --> 19:04.352
than any shitty politician has done
in the last ten years

19:04.435 --> 19:06.937
'cause he sued Gawker out of existence.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.190
And that was a very big thing.
You guys know the story.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.818
Hulk was fucking that woman.
He did not know he was being filmed.

19:12.902 --> 19:18.115
And Gawker, I guess, put a link to it up,
and he says it ruined his life.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.910
I think there was racist language
or something.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.579
I guess at the time,
Brooke was dating a black guy,

19:23.663 --> 19:26.374
and I guess Hulk was none too pleased.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.002
And apparently he said the word "nigger"
so many times

19:30.086 --> 19:32.171
that Dog the Bounty Hunter hung up
on him.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.512
So, WWE fired him,
and he said it ruined his life.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.596
But I'll be honest.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.598
I'm a bigger Hulk Hogan fan now
than I've never been.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.767
Did you see the cock on Hulk Hogan?

19:45.935 --> 19:47.770
I ran out and bought
a little yellow headband.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.397
I'm a Hulkamaniac.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.526
Jesus Christ. I never understood
why that stupid leg drop

19:53.609 --> 19:55.361
was such an effective finishing move.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.869
But now I'm just amazed nobody was killed

20:03.953 --> 20:06.539
with that Civil War cannon strapped
to his leg.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.000
"I'm gonna rip your asshole apart,
brother!"

20:12.294 --> 20:13.546
Thank you. That's my Hulk Hogan.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.673
That's what you do when you can't do
an impression as a comedian.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.342
You just jazz it up by moving funny.
You like Christopher Walken?

20:18.426 --> 20:20.720
"Oh! You know, my watch. Ow!"

20:23.347 --> 20:26.058
You name a person, I'll do him.
I don't care. I do good.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.687
I thought you were gonna name somebody.
Okay.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.565
Oprah!

20:32.648 --> 20:36.402
Oprah? Worst guess ever.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.198
You got to watch it. I was bummed
I fucked up that relationship,

20:41.282 --> 20:43.409
because that girl, she was dirty, man.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.828
She would, like, lick my ass.
She was a trooper.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.539
Every guy likes their ass eaten.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.375
Let's not pretend that I'm the only one
who likes their ass licked.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.170
Here's why that did not get
the rousing round of applause

20:54.253 --> 20:55.838
that ass-eating does deserve.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.717
Literally...
No, you don't have to do it now.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.386
But whenever someone mentions ass-eating,
here's what people ought to do:

21:02.470 --> 21:06.932
"Hold on. Let me put my drink down
and applaud for the idea of ass-eating."

21:09.477 --> 21:10.519
No, no, no.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.730
Hey. Easy.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.775
She would eat my ass, and she would...

21:15.858 --> 21:17.985
Look, here's the thing
with getting your ass licked.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.069
It's...

21:20.404 --> 21:22.656
It's embarrassing to ask for.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.366
There's nothing worse than asking
for something

21:24.450 --> 21:27.953
and having a girl go, "No."
Then you're ashamed of liking it.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.956
If you want a girl to suck your dick,
you might go, "Come on, suck my dick."

21:31.040 --> 21:33.751
And if she says no, then you can
kind of coax her a little bit.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.252
Like, "Come on, suck my dick.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.464
Eh? How about it?"

21:42.510 --> 21:44.595
But it's embarrassing if you're like,

21:44.678 --> 21:48.474
"Come on, just lick my ass a little bit."
"No."

21:48.557 --> 21:51.185
"Come on, what are you doing?
Just get back there and eat it.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.731
Part the hair with a comb
and slam your face in there.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.274
What are you doing?

21:58.943 --> 22:01.570
You're gonna feel like you're kissing
the scalp of a marathon runner.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.239
Get in there, you silly goose."

22:08.202 --> 22:10.621
So, you gotta kind of hint at it.

22:10.704 --> 22:14.166
'Cause you can't be ashamed
about something if you're hinting.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.502
So, say your girlfriend
is sucking your dick,

22:16.585 --> 22:19.296
and she pops it out
and she's, like, licking the back.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.131
Exaggeration, obviously.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.053
What do you want, truth in comedy?
All right, so, she's licking the...

22:32.476 --> 22:35.437
"What is he doing?
Is he sealing an envelope

22:35.521 --> 22:38.274
or rolling a joint?
I don't understand."

22:43.279 --> 22:45.406
But if you hint at something,
there's no shame in it

22:45.489 --> 22:46.615
'cause they can't reject it.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.160
So, if your girlfriend is giving you head,
you start raising your hips...

22:50.244 --> 22:52.413
just a little bit. And moaning.
Get a little help, like...

22:55.541 --> 22:59.628
Your balls will slowly drag over her face
like a street sweeper.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.302
Then they're finally just sitting
on her forehead.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.220
She looks like Tiberius Caesar.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.975
She's like, "All right, I get it.
You want your ass licked. Got it."

23:14.059 --> 23:16.145
And then they always do
that little tester lick on your asshole.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.229
Just a little...

23:18.981 --> 23:20.524
You ever lick an asshole?
It's like testing a battery.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.244
And I'm gonna brag a little.
My asshole passes with flying colors.

23:32.328 --> 23:37.082
My asshole is like two immaculate,
hairless peach halves.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.293
And that's exactly how I describe it
on PlentyOfFish.

23:39.376 --> 23:43.714
"Two immaculate, hairless peach halves,

23:43.797 --> 23:45.466
just meant for nuzzling."

23:47.801 --> 23:50.804
But I'm a dirty guy. I'm a dirty person.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.640
And it's funny.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.266
My whole career... for those of you
who are familiar with me...

23:54.350 --> 23:58.270
I've always said, "I'm a pervert."
But I'm not a pervert.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.856
'Cause a pervert implies
you like a victim,

24:00.939 --> 24:02.483
or you like tricking people.

24:02.566 --> 24:06.695
And I realized that recently.
I don't like anybody vulnerable in sex.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.698
I don't like drunk girls.
I don't like underage girls.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.034
I don't have sex with children.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.994
And I don't why more men
don't talk about that.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.412
That's my best quality.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.419
I don't like virgins. I don't like women
who've only been with a couple of guys,

24:22.503 --> 24:25.464
'cause then it means too much to them,
and I know I'm kind of a piece of shit.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.926
So, I don't want a girl to look at me
with puppy love,

24:29.009 --> 24:31.637
just kissing it like,
"You're so special.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.431
Do you love me, too?
Oh, my God. I'm so happy."

24:34.515 --> 24:37.393
I want a girl to look at my dick and go,
"Ugh, I wish it was black,"

24:37.476 --> 24:39.436
and then blow a snot rocket on it.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.783
Jared Fogle is a pervert.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.077
How do you fuck up the Subway endorsement?

24:55.160 --> 24:58.747
Jared's whole job was
to hold up those big, fat-fuck pants.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.124
That was his job.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.545
Don't get fat, don't fuck kids.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.963
How hard is that?

25:07.131 --> 25:08.549
I could do that in my sleep.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.009
If you just it say to yourself
on the way out the door...

25:11.093 --> 25:13.762
"Don't get fat and don't fuck kids.
Don't get fat...

25:14.513 --> 25:18.016
don't fuck kids.
Don't get fat, don't fuck kids."

25:22.062 --> 25:23.856
But it's amazing how many people...

25:23.939 --> 25:26.650
you realize their sexual behavior
is so fucked up.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.278
Obviously, Cosby.
I love his new excuse now.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.905
"I couldn't have committed those rapes.
I'm blind now."

25:31.989 --> 25:33.282
Oh, that's how it works.

25:35.409 --> 25:38.370
And I feel really bad for his wife,
Nelson Mandela.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.831
Jesus.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.506
But you knew Cosby was guilty
when Oprah...

25:49.590 --> 25:51.300
Oprah. You got me on fucking Oprah.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.515
You knew Cosby was guilty when
Whoopi Goldberg stopped defending him.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.685
Whoopi defended him for years,
and then finally she had to...

26:01.769 --> 26:03.353
But first of all,
what happened to Whoopi Goldberg?

26:03.437 --> 26:05.939
She looks like KRS-One now.
What the fuck happened to her?

26:13.155 --> 26:16.241
And a lot of those women...
Here's what tells you that he did it.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.285
A lot of those women
were in their 70s,

26:18.368 --> 26:20.496
and 70-year-old women just don't lie
about rape.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.706
I'm not saying that young women are liars,

26:22.790 --> 26:24.875
but women that old
don't ever talk about sex.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.251
They don't lie about sex.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.754
Seventy-year-old women lie
about other shit.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.340
"My grandson called."

26:35.260 --> 26:37.679
"Fuck you, liar. No, he didn't.

26:38.931 --> 26:42.226
It was a wrong number, and you kept him
on the phone for an hour and a half.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.144
You lying old bag!"

26:48.941 --> 26:51.902
But you try to find something good
in everything.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.571
And the wonderful thing
about that relationship ending

26:54.655 --> 26:56.365
was that it forced me
to start working out

26:56.448 --> 26:58.367
'cause I knew I was gonna have
to meet women again.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.785
And I lost a lot of weight.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.454
Has anybody lost weight
in the last few years?

27:02.538 --> 27:03.956
How much weight did you lose?

27:04.832 --> 27:07.376
I lost 100 pounds.
I lost 100 pounds.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.294
What? You lost 100 pounds?

27:09.378 --> 27:11.463
Jeez. What, did you drown your girlfriend?
What happened?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.556
- How'd you lose 100 pounds?
- I don't work out. I just...

27:20.639 --> 27:23.267
You don't work out? Come on.
You mean that's natural?

27:26.687 --> 27:28.939
That's like me saying,
"I don't play center for the Lakers."

27:29.022 --> 27:30.357
No shit, stupid.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.737
When you start losing weight,
here's the thing.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.156
A hundred pounds, congratulations.
That's awesome.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.367
Oh, yeah. Give him a hand.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.707
The weird thing is,
I lost about 30 pounds over the years,

27:46.790 --> 27:48.250
and when you start losing weight,

27:48.333 --> 27:51.920
the first five or six or ten pounds,
people are like, "Wow, you look great."

27:52.004 --> 27:56.592
But after you lose, like, 15 pounds,
people don't know how to respond.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.677
Twenty pounds, they're like,
"Uh...

28:00.012 --> 28:04.266
have you been dieting,
or did Charlie Sheen bleed in your mouth?"

28:10.564 --> 28:12.649
Is it okay to joke about Charlie?

28:12.733 --> 28:16.361
Was anybody shocked when he announced
he was HIV-positive? No.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.613
I like Charlie Sheen,

28:17.696 --> 28:20.365
but that's how you know
you've lived a pretty AIDSy life...

28:21.241 --> 28:23.952
when you're that famous
and you're like, "I'm HIV-positive,"

28:24.036 --> 28:26.121
and the whole country is like,
"Well, yeah, I hope so."

28:28.457 --> 28:29.708
For Pete's sake.

28:31.835 --> 28:36.256
I gotta be honest.
Charlie's HIV diagnosis really scared me.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.759
It really shook me because...

28:38.842 --> 28:41.595
I don't know Charlie.
We've never met, never hung out.

28:41.678 --> 28:42.888
But it just kind of rocked me,

28:42.971 --> 28:45.140
and I started thinking
about my sexual behavior.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.476
Even though we've never met,
Charlie and I have had sex

28:47.559 --> 28:50.604
with, I think, four of the same people.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.065
And there's only one
I can mention publicly

28:53.148 --> 28:55.150
because she and I
have discussed it publicly,

28:55.234 --> 28:56.610
and I don't ever want to out people.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.738
But for many years on the radio,
we would interview Bree Olson.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.740
Bree would come in.
If you don't know Bree,

29:01.823 --> 29:03.659
she's a beautiful blond porn star.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.703
She's fun. She's really sexy,
and whenever she was on our show,

29:06.787 --> 29:08.163
she'd always flirt with me.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.207
She'd always be like, "I like you.
You're really cute."

29:10.290 --> 29:11.875
And I was always like,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

29:11.959 --> 29:14.378
'Cause I thought she was just doing it
for the radio.

29:14.461 --> 29:17.130
She's probably thinking,
"This guy is blowing me off,"

29:17.214 --> 29:20.634
but meanwhile, I just have no self-esteem.
I'm just like, "Oh, come on."

29:21.593 --> 29:24.513
She thinks I'm too cool for the room.
Meanwhile, I feel like the Elephant Man

29:24.596 --> 29:27.182
when he has the tuxedo on
in front of British high society.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.560
"Everybody's been so kind!"

29:35.816 --> 29:40.112
But one day, her publicist says to me,
"No, Bree actually likes you.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.655
She's not joking."

29:41.738 --> 29:47.119
And whatever cool, detached attitude
I had built up evaporated.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.247
I was at Bree's hotel
in less than an hour. Like, really...

29:50.330 --> 29:51.790
"Hi!"

29:53.125 --> 29:56.586
This close to the fucking,
you know... peephole.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.214
You think my face is unpleasant now?
Look at it through the hole.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.465
It's just a fucking...

30:02.342 --> 30:03.802
stupid half a moon.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.096
And we fucked. And I gotta be honest.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.975
It's one of the most earthshattering
sexual experiences I've ever had.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.310
It was beautiful.

30:11.393 --> 30:14.104
And I don't think
that she enjoyed it as much...

30:15.188 --> 30:16.690
'cause she would never do it again.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.609
I tried for years to make it happen again.
I would text her, "What are you doing?"

30:19.693 --> 30:21.528
She'd write back,
"Anything but fucking you."

30:21.611 --> 30:22.696
It just was...

30:24.865 --> 30:26.908
I think I blew it. Let me ask you,

30:26.992 --> 30:29.286
is it a turn-off to say "I love you"
too quickly?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.247
All right, let me ask the women.
Is it a turn-off

30:32.331 --> 30:35.375
if the first time you fuck a guy,
as he's putting it in,

30:35.459 --> 30:38.086
he's mumbling,
"I love you, I love you, I love you,"

30:38.170 --> 30:40.714
and crying onto your face?
Is that a turn-off?

30:42.966 --> 30:45.927
And I was talking to a buddy of mine.
He was like, "Did you wear a condom?"

30:46.011 --> 30:48.847
I'm like, "What a cute question.
No, stupid. I didn't.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.017
When you're getting into a Lamborghini,
you don't put on a body bag, do you?"

30:59.399 --> 31:02.361
I wouldn't have worn a condom
if I looked into her pussy

31:02.444 --> 31:04.988
and saw Magic Johnson waving up at me.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.337
So, then, you fast-forward.
We have sex. She goes out to LA.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.089
She dates Charlie Sheen at one point.

31:22.172 --> 31:25.133
Then all of a sudden, Charlie comes out
and announces he's HIV-positive.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.385
So, I just backtracked a little bit.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.012
I'm like, "Oh, no,
did I get the whole ball rolling?

31:31.681 --> 31:34.267
Oh, no, I gave AIDS
to the guy from <i>Platoon.</i>

31:34.351 --> 31:35.769
I'm a piece of shit."

31:37.562 --> 31:41.066
But luckily, Bree Olson has been tested
multiple times.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.361
She does not have HIV.
She is totally negative,

31:44.444 --> 31:46.696
which means I'm HIV-negative.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.574
Yeah, that's how I take an AIDS test.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.121
I'm too freaked out to go to the doctor,

31:54.204 --> 31:56.248
so I just fuck a girl
and then see her in a year,

31:56.331 --> 31:57.416
and, you know...

31:58.667 --> 32:00.293
"Hey, how are you?"

32:00.377 --> 32:02.254
"I'm great." "Makes two of us."

32:07.092 --> 32:08.343
She had the strength to smile.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.720
That's six more months of no rubbers
for the kid.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.356
And it's hard for me to meet people,
to be really honest with you,

32:21.440 --> 32:24.526
because I've talked about myself
so much publicly.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.112
People know so many things about me,
and none of it's a secret.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.865
Anybody familiar with me
knows I like transgender girls.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.658
That's not new information.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.827
And if it is, well, now you have it.

32:35.328 --> 32:38.331
But it's so funny.
The whole country is, like, trans-crazy,

32:38.415 --> 32:39.708
and we're really obsessed with it,

32:39.791 --> 32:41.835
and it's so funny how
when the new thing happens

32:41.918 --> 32:44.463
or becomes in the lexicon,

32:44.546 --> 32:46.756
you can't joke about it on TV.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.675
I tried to do a Caitlyn Jenner joke,

32:48.758 --> 32:50.886
and the network said,
"Oh, no transition jokes."

32:50.969 --> 32:52.345
I'm like, "It's not even a mean joke."

32:52.429 --> 32:53.972
They're like,
"Yeah, but we just don't like it.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.765
They've been marginalized."

32:55.849 --> 32:57.684
I'm like, "Look, just 'cause
you've been marginalized

32:57.767 --> 33:00.312
doesn't mean that you're removed
from the humor spectrum

33:00.395 --> 33:01.480
like everybody else."

33:01.563 --> 33:06.151
It wasn't even a mean joke. First of all,
the network canceled her reality show.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.236
How shitty is your reality show

33:08.320 --> 33:10.572
when you were on a Wheaties box,
you're now a woman,

33:10.655 --> 33:12.908
you were a Kardashian,
you killed somebody driving,

33:12.991 --> 33:15.619
and the network goes, "It's boring.
There's nothing happening to talk about"?

33:23.126 --> 33:26.213
And I think Hollywood means well.
Their hearts are in the right place.

33:26.296 --> 33:29.299
But it's a little bit phony.
Some of it is just a little bit fake.

33:29.382 --> 33:32.511
You know how they can't talk about Caitlyn
without saying how beautiful she is?

33:32.594 --> 33:34.804
"Have you seen how beautiful Caitlyn is?"

33:35.805 --> 33:36.932
No.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.644
She looks like the gypsy from <i>Thinner.</i>

33:49.027 --> 33:49.986
But it's so funny.

33:50.820 --> 33:54.366
Not one of these freethinking,
progressive celebrities

33:54.449 --> 33:56.785
who always use the right pronoun,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.746
not one of them has admitted to having sex
with a transgender girl,

33:59.829 --> 34:02.916
to watching trans porn,
to being attracted to trans women.

34:02.999 --> 34:06.169
Not one of them. That's being supportive.

34:06.253 --> 34:09.047
Don't tell me what words to use.
You want to support a young lady?

34:09.130 --> 34:12.592
You lift her skirt, you suck her cock.
That's how you say, "I'm with you."

34:16.471 --> 34:19.724
Don't tell me what to joke about until
you've laid in bed with a sore asshole,

34:19.808 --> 34:21.309
mumbling, "Who am I?"

34:24.980 --> 34:26.022
You ever brush your teeth

34:26.106 --> 34:28.525
and scream "faggot" in the mirror
for a half hour?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.110
I have.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.954
And I know why they won't talk about it.
I know why they won't admit it.

34:41.036 --> 34:42.581
'Cause they don't know
if it makes you gay.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.456
"If I have sex with a trans girl,
does that make..."

34:44.541 --> 34:47.377
It does not make you gay
to have sex with a trans girl.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.719
But even if it did, I would tell you.
I wouldn't care.

34:55.802 --> 34:58.638
But I understand
why certain people think it does.

34:58.722 --> 35:01.600
We can't be so pro-trans
or politically correct

35:01.683 --> 35:04.644
that we forget that differing opinions
are gonna pop up.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.938
An open and honest conversation
doesn't mean

35:07.022 --> 35:09.983
that you just shut down somebody
when they say unpleasant shit.

35:10.066 --> 35:13.612
I get why some guys think it's gay.
But it's just not. Until you've done it...

35:13.695 --> 35:15.655
Like, when you kiss,
it's a feminine energy.

35:15.739 --> 35:18.283
It's not a masculine energy,
or it wouldn't turn me on.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.036
The breasts are normally fake,
but so what?

35:21.119 --> 35:23.079
Every stripper I ever fell in love with
had fake tits.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.790
That never turned me off. I never
threw a girl out of the Champagne Room.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.043
"Beat it with your augmented bosoms,
madam!"

35:30.837 --> 35:32.464
You know, then the skirt comes up.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.591
All right.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.093
It's a large clitoris.

35:39.763 --> 35:42.182
But what, am I gonna be rude to my guest?
Get over here.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.148
Just look at the breasts, that's all.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.900
If you're new to the game,
look at the breasts.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.152
"Oh, I love her so much. I love her."

35:54.235 --> 35:56.738
If it's your first time at the rodeo,
don't look at the feet.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.114
That'll put the whammy on you.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.287
"Oh, no, those feet scored 13 points
in the fourth quarter.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.705
I'm fucking gay."

36:11.753 --> 36:16.216
And it's funny, too... I've talked
to a lot of trans girls about...

36:16.299 --> 36:19.010
One girl told me that,
just to feel feminine as a kid,

36:19.094 --> 36:21.388
she used to wear her mother's underwear.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.889
Whew.

36:22.972 --> 36:25.934
That one affected me.
I mean, your mother's underpants.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.312
I don't care what gender you are.
Is there a worse item in the house...

36:30.480 --> 36:33.191
than your mother's underpants?

36:33.274 --> 36:34.734
I wouldn't touch my mother's underpants

36:34.818 --> 36:37.529
if she was hanging off a bridge
by her underpants.

36:39.739 --> 36:43.451
I'd probably just blow her a kiss
and then step on her fucking fingers.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.997
Did you ever see your mom's panties
on the floor?

36:48.081 --> 36:50.333
You gotta take a stick
and knock them under the dresser.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.129
Can you imagine putting those on?

36:54.212 --> 36:57.507
I'd rather wear my father's used condom
on my nose like an aardvark.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.436
I saw one pair of my mom's panties
when I was a kid.

37:09.519 --> 37:12.772
Thank God they weren't sexy at all.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.066
I feel bad for any kid
that has the hot mom

37:15.150 --> 37:16.735
who all his friends want to fuck.

37:16.818 --> 37:20.447
We all had that one friend,
everyone wanted to fuck his mother.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.949
And that's gotta be awful
to find your mom's panties,

37:23.032 --> 37:26.327
and it's just a pair of boy shorts
with a little arrow in the back.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.662
Like, "Ugh.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.873
Oh, no. Mom's a three-holer."

37:33.209 --> 37:34.836
My mom's panties were awful.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.255
They started at the middle of the chest.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.048
They ended right above the knee.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.593
It looked like an androgynous bathing suit
on <i>Boardwalk Empire.</i>

37:41.676 --> 37:43.303
That's what you want your mother...

37:44.345 --> 37:46.639
If you see your mother in her panties,
you want to start thinking,

37:46.723 --> 37:49.350
<i>"♪ Hello, my ragtime gal ♪"</i>

37:51.436 --> 37:53.938
You don't want to think
about your parents sexually at all.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.107
You know your parents fuck
because we're all alive,

37:56.191 --> 37:57.233
so we're evidence of it.

37:57.317 --> 38:00.236
But my parents told me,
like, when I asked about it,

38:00.320 --> 38:02.947
they said, "We just made love
because we wanted to create you

38:03.031 --> 38:05.658
and we wanted to create your sister Tracy.
That's the only reason."

38:05.742 --> 38:09.078
So, they made it look like it was purely
something they suffered through

38:09.162 --> 38:10.288
to make me.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.041
That's how all of you look
at your parents.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.292
You don't even want to think
about your mother

38:14.375 --> 38:17.837
kind of drunk on the bed going,
"Come on, hurry up!"

38:19.839 --> 38:23.009
And your father going,
"You're not even wet yet!"

38:24.177 --> 38:27.263
And her going,
"That's my asshole, stupid!"

38:29.682 --> 38:31.476
And he's not hard.
He's got paintbrush dick.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.020
You don't want to think about your father
with paintbrush dick.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.944
Looks like a snail
trying to break into an aquarium.

38:45.907 --> 38:48.535
You don't want to picture your mother
going, "Hold on.

38:48.618 --> 38:49.869
Hurry up."

38:58.670 --> 39:01.339
I'll give you all a second
to insert your parents into that thought,

39:01.422 --> 39:05.385
like I have to do every time I tell
that fucking stupid joke.

39:07.637 --> 39:10.098
But it's so funny how we just don't think
of them that way.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.183
And I grew up in a pretty conservative...

39:12.267 --> 39:15.103
I don't know how I turned
into such a monster

39:15.186 --> 39:16.813
growing up in a conservative house.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.399
Did anybody have
kind of open-minded parents

39:19.482 --> 39:21.526
who would talk to you about sex?
Anybody have parents like that?

39:21.609 --> 39:23.069
- Yes.
- Who said "yes"?

39:23.152 --> 39:25.488
You're nodding. How old were you
when your parents talked to you about sex?

39:25.572 --> 39:27.490
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?

39:27.574 --> 39:30.243
- They broke it to me hard.
- They broke it to you hard?

39:31.244 --> 39:32.495
How'd they break it to you?

39:32.579 --> 39:35.999
They just straight up told me,
"This is how this happens. There you are."

39:36.082 --> 39:38.543
They straight up told you, "This is
how this happens, and there you are."

39:40.378 --> 39:42.463
And when you were 13, you didn't know...

39:43.381 --> 39:45.049
Oh, no, what else did they tell you?

39:45.133 --> 39:48.303
"And we're the ones who put the gifts
under the tree."

39:53.141 --> 39:55.351
Did you ever catch them having sex?
Anybody ever catch your parents?

39:55.435 --> 39:56.519
Oh, I did.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.230
- There's always a couple.
- I did.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.982
- Who's the woman who said, "I did"?
- I did.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.066
Hello, miss.

40:06.779 --> 40:09.240
- They talked about it to me...
- Hold on, miss.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.326
You're panicking. I feel like...

40:11.409 --> 40:13.369
She's been waiting 30 years
for someone to ask her,

40:13.453 --> 40:14.829
"Did they ever talk to you about it?"

40:17.415 --> 40:18.499
Hold on.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.669
How old were you when you saw them?

40:23.129 --> 40:24.797
I tried to block it out.

40:24.881 --> 40:28.051
Are you trying to block it...
I'm just asking in general. About how old?

40:28.134 --> 40:30.303
I don't know.
I would assume, like, ten or so.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.430
About ten.
What were you doing at the time?

40:32.513 --> 40:34.682
- Were you in the house?
- Yeah, I had a bad dream.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.351
- I walked into their room.
- You had a bad dream.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.770
Oh, Christ. Then you walked
into a nightmare. That's nice.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.403
That's the last thing you need
after a bad dream.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.405
"Oh, I dreamt there was a ghost
under my bed.

40:49.489 --> 40:50.615
Oh, terrific."

40:53.993 --> 40:54.994
Now, you walked in.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.746
- Were they in the bedroom?
- Yeah.

40:56.829 --> 40:59.082
- Did they know that you saw them?
- Yeah.

40:59.165 --> 41:00.875
Yes, they did.
Did they talk to you about it after?

41:00.959 --> 41:03.711
It was obvious. No, my dad asked me
if I wanted hot chocolate.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.797
Your dad asked
if you wanted hot chocolate.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.052
Oh, no. They were having anal. Oh, no.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.434
Well, that's what you need
after you catch your parents fucking.

41:18.518 --> 41:19.978
"Aah!"

41:20.061 --> 41:21.312
"Let's have a cocoa."

41:27.610 --> 41:29.445
Now, okay, so you had hot chocolate,

41:29.529 --> 41:31.489
and they told you about what happened
and what it was?

41:31.572 --> 41:35.410
No. Like, my parents...
I knew what it was when I walked in.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.246
You knew what it was when you walked in.
Some people just don't talk about it.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.957
It's just no eye contact
at the breakfast table until you're 18.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.917
Like, "You want milk for your Cheerios?"

41:43.001 --> 41:45.003
"No, I'll just fucking cut it
with a fork and knife."

41:47.505 --> 41:49.590
I know you kind of don't want
to think about it. I understand.

41:49.674 --> 41:50.800
What position...

41:53.094 --> 41:54.470
were they in?

41:55.471 --> 41:57.682
It depends, is this gonna be aired?
Are they gonna know?

41:57.765 --> 42:00.601
Is it gonna be aired? No!

42:00.685 --> 42:02.562
No!

42:03.604 --> 42:04.772
No.

42:05.940 --> 42:06.983
No.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.528
Why would we air it on a Netflix special?

42:12.613 --> 42:14.532
Wow. Somebody's not very observant.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.868
What did you think that was?

42:16.951 --> 42:20.246
Did you think that was LeBron James' arm
taking a selfie?

42:27.837 --> 42:30.631
Yeah, so, we don't know who you are,
we don't know who your parents are.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.050
What position?

42:36.012 --> 42:39.307
- Oh, you're really waiting for...
- I'm really waiting. Of course I am.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.143
Please. You think that thing
just jumped up for no reason?

42:45.021 --> 42:47.356
It's not dripping down my leg for nothing,
sweetie.

42:49.567 --> 42:53.821
- I don't know. Just, like, regular.
- Regular. Missionary. Okay, cool.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.407
Were Mom's legs wrapped around Dad?

42:59.577 --> 43:02.038
Like, was she trying to keep in that seed?

43:02.121 --> 43:06.959
Or were the legs wide open
'cause Dad was drilling that pussy...

43:08.544 --> 43:11.881
so hard that her legs just shot open?

43:16.761 --> 43:19.472
Thank you very much for sharing that
with us.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.733
It's funny, people's reaction
when they catch their parents.

43:30.817 --> 43:32.902
I've never caught my parents, thank God,

43:32.985 --> 43:35.238
but you kind of know
when they're doing something.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.906
I would always know my parents
were doing something

43:36.989 --> 43:38.533
'cause it'd be in the middle
of the afternoon

43:38.616 --> 43:40.743
and the bedroom door would be closed,

43:40.827 --> 43:42.161
and then you'd just hear, like...

43:43.996 --> 43:45.206
And then the telltale...

43:46.499 --> 43:47.792
of the Polaroid.

43:54.590 --> 43:57.218
And you knew they were almost finished
as it started getting faster.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.803
And then you'd hear, "My eye burns!"

44:03.474 --> 44:05.518
Then your mom
and three of your dad's coworkers

44:05.601 --> 44:07.103
would walk out of the bedroom.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.403
But some people...
Like, we talked, some parents...

44:15.486 --> 44:18.322
some parents are just open-minded,
and they're more liberal about it.

44:18.406 --> 44:21.409
My buddy Scott knew where
his mother's dildo collection was.

44:22.118 --> 44:24.745
And we did not handle that information
responsibly.

44:26.706 --> 44:29.500
As ten-year-old kids,
as soon as his parents left the house,

44:29.584 --> 44:32.295
we would grab the dildos,
start sword-fighting with them.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.424
We'd try to chase him
and shove them in his mouth.

44:41.762 --> 44:44.140
I got one shoved in my mouth.
I had to pretend I didn't like it.

44:44.223 --> 44:45.308
"Cut it out, guys!"

44:49.812 --> 44:51.480
We used to throw them at his cat...

44:53.024 --> 44:56.068
which I wouldn't do now,
but in 1979, that was Xbox.

44:56.152 --> 44:57.486
That was all we had.

44:58.946 --> 45:02.074
And I wish I had an iPhone back then.
What a great video that would've been,

45:02.158 --> 45:04.076
just a cat under a sofa
with its ears back,

45:04.160 --> 45:05.870
hissing at a pile of dildos.

45:10.750 --> 45:12.793
And his mother must've wondered
why all her dildos

45:12.877 --> 45:15.254
had scratch marks and cat hair on them.

45:16.422 --> 45:18.424
She'd probably grab the cat
and smack his face.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.509
"What were you doing with my dildos?"

45:26.349 --> 45:28.392
I don't know if my mother has dildos
to this day.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.394
I'm in my 40s. I have no idea.

45:30.478 --> 45:33.189
When my parents die,
I'm not going through their shit.

45:33.272 --> 45:36.859
I'm just going to take the dresser
and kick it into the front yard.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.196
Let the homeless people take
whatever they want.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.865
Maybe I'll look out the window
and see a homeless guy running away

45:42.949 --> 45:46.452
with what is hopefully
a small white dildo.

45:46.535 --> 45:47.870
That's all you can hope for.

45:48.704 --> 45:52.124
You definitely don't want to see one
of those over-the-shoulder jobs.

45:58.047 --> 46:01.092
Bouncing in the front and the back.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.427
With two heads on it. "Oh, Mom."

46:04.804 --> 46:06.847
Or "Oh, Mom and Dad. Ohh.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.351
Oh, no. Mom and Dad were bookending."

46:16.941 --> 46:19.151
Yeah, they were pretty normal people.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.196
And I turned into such a dirtbag
and a dirty guy,

46:22.279 --> 46:25.324
and I just... I don't know.
I was always kind of antisocial.

46:25.408 --> 46:26.742
You ever look back at your life
and realize,

46:26.826 --> 46:29.620
"Wow, I was a fucking antisocial
human being."

46:29.704 --> 46:31.998
When I was 13,
I used to drink with my friends.

46:32.081 --> 46:34.875
I stopped when I was very young,
but for the few years I did it,

46:34.959 --> 46:38.212
I was a weirdo. Like, a real weirdo.

46:38.295 --> 46:40.381
We used to get drunk at my friend's house,

46:40.464 --> 46:42.842
and I wouldn't do fun drunk stuff.

46:42.925 --> 46:45.886
I used to get drunk and then just go
into his family's bathroom

46:45.970 --> 46:48.681
and urinate all over the sink handles

46:49.557 --> 46:52.935
and, like, on the toothbrushes
and in the soap dish.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.439
And here's the psychotic part.

46:56.522 --> 46:59.191
I wouldn't even tell my other friends
I had done it.

46:59.275 --> 47:03.237
When you're that young, no matter what
you do to make your friends laugh is okay.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.365
But I didn't tell my friends.
I just kind of sat there,

47:06.449 --> 47:09.368
just smirking
like a fucking serial killer,

47:10.327 --> 47:13.998
just thinking of his family
washing their face with my piss soap.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.125
Like, what a fucking creep.

47:21.130 --> 47:23.674
And I've talked about this before
on the air.

47:23.758 --> 47:28.220
The cat... I would always take the cat,
and I would unroll his father's newspaper

47:28.304 --> 47:30.973
and scoop all the cat shit out
of the litterbox

47:31.057 --> 47:34.518
and put it in the newspaper
and then carefully roll it back up

47:35.603 --> 47:37.855
and put it on the coffee table.

47:37.938 --> 47:41.358
And to this day, I still think
I'm kind of a genius for having done that.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.862
But I never got to see the results of it.

47:44.945 --> 47:48.699
Like, if I had a time machine
and I could only use it once,

47:48.783 --> 47:51.911
I wouldn't save Jesus.
I wouldn't stop World War II.

47:51.994 --> 47:55.331
I'd go back to North Brunswick,
New Jersey, in 1979

47:55.414 --> 47:58.209
just to watch that man
open his newspaper

47:59.418 --> 48:02.546
and see his face as animal shit fell
on his lap.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.134
You know how many times that cat
probably got beaten with a shoe?

48:08.886 --> 48:12.306
And the cat can't articulate.
"Really? You think I took my own shit

48:12.389 --> 48:15.851
and put it in a newspaper
and rolled it up carefully

48:15.935 --> 48:18.896
like I'm fucking hosting a cat prank show,
you dummy?"

48:21.982 --> 48:24.985
You ever have memories come flooding back?
That happens sometimes, too.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.071
I blocked a lot of shit out
when I was young.

48:27.154 --> 48:29.698
And this one is not even traumatic.
It was just weird.

48:29.782 --> 48:33.077
I was with my friend,
and we were stealing <i>Star Wars</i> figures.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.079
They were the original
<i>Star Wars</i> figures.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.998
Remember them?
They were, like, four inches tall,

48:38.082 --> 48:40.626
and some of them are worth thousands
of dollars today

48:40.709 --> 48:42.128
because they're ultra-rare.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.964
So, it was one of my best friends.
He was a really good dude.

48:45.047 --> 48:47.424
He had a huge dick.
And we're in a department...

48:47.508 --> 48:49.885
I'm saying that for a reason.
I'm not just throwing...

48:49.969 --> 48:52.138
That would be great
if I didn't go back to it for any reason.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.765
"Did he elaborate on his friend's dick?"

48:54.849 --> 48:56.892
"No, he just threw it out there
and smiled."

48:58.561 --> 49:00.646
He was just the guy
that we all knew had a huge dick.

49:00.729 --> 49:04.859
So, we had on shorts and tank tops,
so we couldn't put stuff down our shorts.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.736
So, we were taking the action figures out
of the package

49:07.820 --> 49:10.614
and kind of walking up
to the front of the store and hiding them,

49:10.698 --> 49:12.533
and at the end of the day,
we were gonna scoop a bunch

49:12.616 --> 49:14.160
and just run out the door.

49:14.243 --> 49:17.663
So, security sees us at one point,
takes us downstairs.

49:17.746 --> 49:19.456
And he says,
"What the fuck are you guys doing?!"

49:19.540 --> 49:21.125
We're like, "We didn't do anything."

49:21.208 --> 49:25.129
And then he looks at the bulge
in my friend's pants,

49:25.212 --> 49:26.630
and he goes, "What have you got in there?"

49:26.714 --> 49:29.550
Again, I knew my friend had a big dick,
so it didn't surprise me

49:29.633 --> 49:32.344
that the security guard thought he had
a couple of Chewbaccas and a Vader.

49:32.428 --> 49:33.554
I got it.

49:34.054 --> 49:38.017
He looked at my shorts
and knew there were no stolen figures.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.143
Maybe a Yoda.

49:41.604 --> 49:43.105
So, my friend's like,
"I don't have anything."

49:43.189 --> 49:45.232
And the security guard goes, "Let me see."

49:45.316 --> 49:47.651
So, my friend pulls his shorts aside,

49:47.735 --> 49:51.822
and this gift of a cock rolls out.

49:51.906 --> 49:53.866
Have you ever seen a cock roll out?

49:53.949 --> 49:57.036
It was like watching
time-lapse photography of a flower.

50:00.039 --> 50:03.542
It was like watching a cinnamon bun
in reverse, on how it's made.

50:04.877 --> 50:08.380
It actually made, like, a little noise.

50:08.464 --> 50:11.133
I'm trying to remember the noise it made
when it hit the chair,

50:11.217 --> 50:12.468
'cause it was a plastic chair.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.095
Have you heard a ham dropped on linoleum?

50:18.098 --> 50:19.850
And it's a surreal moment in my childhood.

50:19.934 --> 50:23.646
We were all just kind of looking
at my friend's big stupid dick.

50:23.729 --> 50:26.899
And then the security guard looks at me,
and he goes, "Wait outside."

50:28.067 --> 50:30.986
Sends me outside. So, I'm outside
the security office 15 minutes.

50:31.070 --> 50:34.490
He comes out, puts his head out the door,
doesn't even open it all the way.

50:34.573 --> 50:37.076
He goes, "All right,
I've decided not to call your mother.

50:37.159 --> 50:39.328
Now get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

50:39.411 --> 50:42.790
I gotta talk to your friend for a while."
And he closes the door.

50:42.873 --> 50:46.669
I walk out that side door.
I wipe it from my memory.

50:46.752 --> 50:51.006
Something sparks it this year,
and the whole day comes flooding back,

50:51.090 --> 50:55.052
and I'm like, "Oh, no. Oh, you idiot.

50:55.135 --> 50:57.972
You never got the rest
of those <i>Star Wars</i> figures."

51:02.977 --> 51:04.687
Thousands of dollars' worth
of merchandise.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.146
And I never would've got caught

51:06.230 --> 51:09.984
'cause the security guard was busy choking
on my friend's giant dick.

51:17.533 --> 51:20.953
So, that's the type of stuff I talk about,
and I wonder why I can't find a gal.

51:23.038 --> 51:24.540
I wouldn't mind a girlfriend
at this point.

51:24.623 --> 51:26.500
I really have been single for five years,

51:26.583 --> 51:29.378
and at this point, I don't even know
where to go to meet women.

51:29.461 --> 51:31.714
I sincerely don't.
I don't know what women want.

51:31.797 --> 51:34.842
We all think we know.
You know, dressing a certain way.

51:34.925 --> 51:37.094
Obviously, I'm not a great dresser.

51:37.177 --> 51:39.179
Do you like my shoes, by the way?

51:40.723 --> 51:43.600
Yeah! Yeah.

51:43.684 --> 51:47.396
I mean, someone told me
these Yeezys are fake.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.898
I don't think they're fake,
'cause if they are,

51:49.982 --> 51:51.817
somebody owes me 20 bucks.

51:54.403 --> 51:56.113
I don't even what women want.
What do women...

51:56.196 --> 52:00.534
I'll ask you as women,
what is it you look for in a guy?

52:00.617 --> 52:02.453
- Humor.
- Humor. Okay.

52:02.536 --> 52:03.871
I'll address this myth.

52:10.627 --> 52:12.880
I think women think they're supposed
to say "humor."

52:12.963 --> 52:15.466
"I love a funny guy." No, you don't.

52:16.717 --> 52:19.094
No, you don't. 'Cause if you asked me,
"What kind of women do you like?"

52:19.178 --> 52:20.554
I'll be like, "Intelligent."

52:21.889 --> 52:24.850
It's nice, but it's not number one
on the list.

52:24.933 --> 52:26.602
Believe me,
if you have fat enough nipples,

52:26.685 --> 52:29.438
I don't care if you eat paint chips
for breakfast...

52:30.898 --> 52:32.649
and fucking bang your head
into a screen door

52:32.733 --> 52:34.943
like Rain Man when the toast is burning.

52:44.661 --> 52:46.413
But sense of humor...
Like, I'm a funny guy.

52:46.497 --> 52:48.832
Being a funny guy
has never, ever helped me get laid.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.085
Here's the only time
that being funny has helped me get laid:

52:51.168 --> 52:54.296
When a woman's only other option
is a guy who looks like me

52:54.380 --> 52:55.631
who isn't funny.

52:56.924 --> 52:59.259
Then it will kind of get you the nod.
Like, "All right."

52:59.343 --> 53:02.304
It's never enthusiastic.
Like, "Oh, my God. You're really..."

53:04.640 --> 53:08.352
It's always a kind of a default.
It's never overcome good looks.

53:08.435 --> 53:11.397
No one's ever looked at me and went,
"Ah, I don't know.

53:11.480 --> 53:14.483
That guy's six-foot-three.
He's got a great body. He's a triathlete.

53:14.566 --> 53:16.193
But the little fella...

53:17.444 --> 53:21.156
his anecdotes will have me in stitches
the entire evening.

53:22.157 --> 53:24.243
Come on, big boy.
Slam your face into my pussy

53:24.326 --> 53:26.328
and do some knock-knock jokes."

53:30.040 --> 53:32.126
And I'm a good guy to date
'cause I'm a dirty guy.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.877
I figure women would like a guy like me.

53:33.961 --> 53:37.464
Like, I love giving oral sex
to women more than I like anything.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.925
And I like... I mean, immediately.
I go right down there.

53:40.008 --> 53:43.512
And I like things on women
that you don't even like on yourselves.

53:43.595 --> 53:46.348
Every special,
I talk about liking a bigger pussy.

53:46.432 --> 53:49.560
I like an untraditional vagina.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.478
A cock. No, I'm kidding.

53:57.359 --> 54:00.654
I like the type of vagina
that a woman is self-conscious about.

54:00.737 --> 54:04.283
You remember in high school, if you had
to keep your crotch in the locker

54:04.366 --> 54:06.368
'cause all the other girls were cruel
and they'd walk by...

54:06.452 --> 54:09.204
"Hey, it's Big Pussy McGillicuddy"
or whatever they'd say.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.627
And I've learned a lot about what's sexy
and what's not sexy.

54:15.711 --> 54:17.880
Don't talk when you're going down
on a woman.

54:17.963 --> 54:20.591
There's nothing sexy you're gonna say
when you're giving her head.

54:20.674 --> 54:23.469
If a girl's going down on you and she's
like, "I love sucking your cock,"

54:23.552 --> 54:25.012
that's kind of sexy to hear.

54:25.095 --> 54:28.098
But there's nothing you're gonna say
when you're going down on a woman

54:28.182 --> 54:30.601
that's gonna make her happier
than what you're doing.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.978
I had a girl tell me that one time
her boyfriend was eating her pussy,

54:33.061 --> 54:37.399
and he stopped, and he looked up
and he went, "Mmm. You taste scrumptious."

54:40.402 --> 54:42.488
It's actually sexier
when you're eating pussy

54:42.571 --> 54:45.157
if you look up and go,
"ISIS beheads people."

54:56.168 --> 54:59.922
I hate using my fingers.
That's the only thing I don't like,

55:00.005 --> 55:01.673
when a girl's like,
"Put your fingers in me."

55:01.757 --> 55:03.634
'Cause I have little hands,

55:04.510 --> 55:09.181
and every time I put my fingers in,
I never quite get to where...

55:09.264 --> 55:12.601
I just barely can touch the bottom
of the G-spot.

55:12.684 --> 55:14.645
And they're always like,
"A little deeper."

55:15.437 --> 55:16.980
"But the webbing."

55:20.400 --> 55:22.194
I gotta take my left arm
and push the right one.

55:25.906 --> 55:28.367
And one of my closest friends
was Patrice O'Neal.

55:28.450 --> 55:29.701
You know Patrice.

55:36.083 --> 55:37.751
And it's funny. Patrice would annoy me,

55:37.834 --> 55:40.712
'cause he would always brag
about how great he was at finger-popping.

55:41.922 --> 55:45.008
But Patrice would always brag
about finger-popping,

55:45.092 --> 55:49.096
and I watched him one time in Brazil
make a girl squirt using his fingers.

55:49.179 --> 55:52.140
'Cause Patrice had fingers
like ballerina legs.

55:52.224 --> 55:56.144
I was in one bed with my girl.
He was in one with his.

55:56.228 --> 55:58.855
And he was like, whap, whap, whap,

55:58.939 --> 56:00.023
and she would squirt.

56:01.483 --> 56:03.652
And then my girl is squirting,
but out of her eyes,

56:03.735 --> 56:04.903
watching the other...

56:07.948 --> 56:10.909
And I'm doing the best I can,
but I just couldn't...

56:10.993 --> 56:15.163
My fingers were like two polio legs
in a swimming pool.

56:17.666 --> 56:19.876
The girl finally got annoyed
and just pushed my hand out.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.129
"All right, Peter Dinklage fingers.
Fucking..."

56:30.304 --> 56:32.014
I really don't know where
to meet the women.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.516
After that bit,
I don't expect to meet a lot of you.

56:35.726 --> 56:39.021
I'm on the social media apps.
I use Tinder. Anybody else use Tinder?

56:39.104 --> 56:40.731
Whoo!

56:40.814 --> 56:42.941
The woman who said "whoo,"
how long did it take you to meet somebody?

56:43.025 --> 56:45.277
- Just yell out the number.
- I'm married.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.903
You're married. Oh, good.

56:50.824 --> 56:52.909
So, your parents fucked missionary,
you're married.

56:52.993 --> 56:55.078
Great. I'm ruining a lot of lives tonight.

56:57.080 --> 56:59.750
Now, was this before your husband,
or is this how you met him?

56:59.833 --> 57:01.418
After.

57:01.501 --> 57:03.629
Whoa!

57:03.712 --> 57:06.173
After. Hmm.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.884
I fucking love that.

57:10.594 --> 57:13.013
"Who are you talking to?"
"It's a buddy, see? Ahh."

57:17.559 --> 57:21.355
I am on Tinder.
And I'm sure most of you know what it is.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.732
You upload photos,
you swipe "like" or "nope,"

57:23.815 --> 57:26.777
and if you have a match,
you can talk to that person.

57:26.860 --> 57:29.571
And before you do it, you have to set
the parameters you want to search,

57:29.655 --> 57:30.656
the distance.

57:30.739 --> 57:35.035
I live here in New York, in Midtown,
so I set it to search a three-mile radius.

57:35.118 --> 57:36.912
And you gotta set the age range.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.373
I'm in my 40s, so I set it for 18.

57:40.832 --> 57:42.918
That's as far left as it would go.
Heh heh heh.

57:47.631 --> 57:49.091
I actually called Tinder to complain.

57:49.174 --> 57:52.594
"There's something wrong with your app,
goddamn it. It keeps getting stuck on 18.

57:53.637 --> 57:57.349
Oh, legal stuff. No, I'm just getting...
Norton, yeah."

58:00.310 --> 58:02.354
It's very addicting. We always say,
"Oh, there's nobody single,"

58:02.437 --> 58:04.022
but you realize
when you get on an app like that,

58:04.106 --> 58:06.024
there are so many beautiful single women.

58:06.108 --> 58:08.944
I was swiping for hours. Like, like, like.

58:09.027 --> 58:11.530
I didn't swipe "nope" on any...
I didn't give a shit what you looked like.

58:11.613 --> 58:14.157
A little, teeny Zika virus.
Fuck it. Like.

58:15.158 --> 58:16.410
Shotgun wound to the face.

58:16.493 --> 58:19.621
Fuck it. I'll play with her nipples
till the ambulance gets there. Like.

58:21.164 --> 58:23.208
I heard somebody groan at that.
It's okay to laugh.

58:23.291 --> 58:24.710
It's not a real scenario.

58:26.670 --> 58:27.796
You think that really happened?

58:27.879 --> 58:29.756
A woman got shot in the face
with a shotgun

58:29.840 --> 58:32.676
and had the wherewithal to snap a selfie?

58:34.761 --> 58:37.723
And then I happened to go,
"Hey, what are you up to?"

58:37.806 --> 58:40.267
"Bleeding to death in the hallway."

58:40.350 --> 58:43.520
"Well, how about I tweak those nips
till help arrives?"

58:48.859 --> 58:51.361
But I was on for three days,
swiping for hours,

58:51.445 --> 58:53.071
getting no responses,

58:53.155 --> 58:55.115
and that's a gut-punch
to your self-esteem.

58:55.198 --> 58:57.034
I'm like,
"I'm a worthless piece of shit."

58:57.117 --> 58:59.911
But then I'm like, "No, maybe I just
didn't put broad enough options."

58:59.995 --> 59:01.705
I only set it for three square miles.

59:01.788 --> 59:05.375
Midtown New York...
what is that, 1.8 million people?

59:10.297 --> 59:14.342
So, I kind of opened up my search options.
Maximum age, maximum distance.

59:14.426 --> 59:17.804
I pretty much set it for,
if you have a pussy in North America,

59:17.888 --> 59:19.723
or hope to someday...

59:25.187 --> 59:26.897
I finally got a Tinder match,

59:26.980 --> 59:31.193
and I'm actually going to read
the interaction to you.

59:32.611 --> 59:35.447
I was talking to this girl.
It was going really, really well.

59:35.530 --> 59:38.950
Talking to her for five days,
back and forth, every day.

59:39.034 --> 59:40.452
"Hey, good morning. How are you?"

59:40.535 --> 59:44.164
On the fifth day, I finally said to her,
"I'm really enjoying speaking to you.

59:44.247 --> 59:46.666
I'd love to talk on the phone.
Can I have your number?"

59:47.501 --> 59:51.713
Nothing. No response.
Absolutely ghosted me.

59:51.797 --> 59:55.759
So, four days later, I write back,
"I guess that's a no. LOL."

59:55.842 --> 59:56.927
You know.

59:57.969 --> 01:00:01.723
Laughing out loud,
just to keep it good-natured and fun.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:03.391
She responds,

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:06.228
"To be perfectly honest,
I googled you."

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.357
I don't know what your lives are like,

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.151
but when you're Jim Norton,
that's the last thing you want to read.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.862
"I googled you."

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:19.741
"Cosby Hitler" has better Google results
than "Jim Norton."

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:24.913
"I googled you and was watching
a video of you talking

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:27.958
about sending photos of your penis
to a girl.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.044
I didn't know if it was a good idea
to give you my number.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.755
So sorry. Just trying to be honest."

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:39.427
I felt awful. I had no idea what to write.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:42.389
I just wrote back, "Cunt.

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:47.394
LOL."

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.106
Thank you guys very much.
You were amazing.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.066
I appreciate you being here.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.613
Thank you guys very much for coming out.

Yeah, really give it to me.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.307
Okay. Say it with conviction,
you ugly slug.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:26.641
And then I start...

Then I slap you again. I'm all right.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.357
- Okay, so, the left one.

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:37.277
