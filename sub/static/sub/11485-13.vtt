WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.643
Here, try this.

00:03.920 --> 00:05.888
- What is it?
- Just try it.

00:06.756 --> 00:07.882
Hey, that's good.

00:07.957 --> 00:10.152
Of course it is.
It's chicken in frumunda sauce.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.318
Frumunda sauce?

00:11.428 --> 00:13.328
Yeah, from unda' the toilet.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.227
Get it, Dad?

00:17.300 --> 00:20.963
Yeah, I get it. I got it 30 years ago,
the first time he said it.

00:21.237 --> 00:23.432
Yeah, but it's new to him.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.331
Check this out. Hey, Jake?

00:25.442 --> 00:28.639
What do you call the red mushy stuff
between the elephant's toes?

00:28.745 --> 00:30.440
- What?
- Slow-moving natives.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.939
I love this kid. He's a comedy blank slate.

00:34.017 --> 00:37.248
I'm glad you do, but you might not
want to share your chopsticks with him.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.255
- I think he's coming down with something.
- Oh, no.

00:40.323 --> 00:42.917
He thinks it's a head cold but it's snot.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.592
Wait a minute,
you don't know that one, either?

00:46.663 --> 00:49.223
I have so much to teach you, grasshopper.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.332
Do you know how to make arm farts?

00:52.435 --> 00:55.404
Charlie? Not at the dinner table.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.167
I'll show you later.

00:57.273 --> 00:59.571
Before I forget,
you got plans for tomorrow night?

00:59.642 --> 01:01.439
- No.
- Make some.

01:01.845 --> 01:04.905
- I'm gonna need the house to myself.
- Fine.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.676
Don't you want to know why?

01:06.750 --> 01:10.015
Jake, if you're done, you can go
to your room and start your homework.

01:10.086 --> 01:12.145
This is about sex, right?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.350
Kids today, huh?

01:14.457 --> 01:17.426
Doesn't know frumunda sauce
but gets why I need the house.

01:18.261 --> 01:21.196
I got a bunch of jokes
you're gonna love in a year or two.

01:21.297 --> 01:23.959
- Cool!
- Go.

01:24.033 --> 01:26.467
You think I'm just a kid but I'm snot.

01:28.705 --> 01:30.696
Wait, that's not right.

01:32.709 --> 01:36.304
Okay, have you ever had revenge sex?

01:36.379 --> 01:39.109
Hang on. Jake, are you in your room?

01:40.984 --> 01:42.212
Yeah!

01:43.520 --> 01:46.546
Revenge sex.
Is that anything like pity sex?

01:46.656 --> 01:48.715
Whole different animal.

01:48.792 --> 01:50.419
Let me break it down for you.

01:50.493 --> 01:52.791
There's this woman, Kathy,
who lives up the beach.

01:52.862 --> 01:56.320
Beautiful woman, I've wanted her
for years. Only one problem.

01:56.399 --> 01:58.867
She's married to kind of a friend of mine.

01:58.968 --> 02:00.162
Kind of a friend?

02:00.236 --> 02:03.171
Well, I never really liked him,
but he had a hot wife.

02:03.239 --> 02:06.003
So, the sanctity of marriage
does slow you down a bit.

02:06.075 --> 02:08.168
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

02:08.244 --> 02:09.711
But then I catch a break.

02:09.812 --> 02:11.474
He cheats on her with her best friend.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.779
She throws him out. So now I'm thinking
she is gonna want justice.

02:14.851 --> 02:17.012
Justice meaning revenge sex with you?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.985
You see it, too, huh?

02:19.222 --> 02:23.352
You're gonna exploit someone's anger
and grief for your own animal gratification.

02:23.459 --> 02:25.825
Hey, I don't bitch about your hobbies.

02:27.130 --> 02:30.622
She's coming over here on Sunday,
so I want you to be out of the way,

02:30.700 --> 02:33.225
because we'll probably be moving
from room to room.

02:33.336 --> 02:36.305
I'll catch a movie.
Just mop up when you're done.

02:36.372 --> 02:37.430
You got it.

02:37.507 --> 02:40.635
Don't take things off his plate.
He's coming down with something.

02:40.710 --> 02:42.803
Relax. I never get sick.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.408
Boy, is he sick.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.914
Well, I can't say he didn't warn me.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.667 --> 03:05.759
How you feeling?

03:05.935 --> 03:07.266
Horrible.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.096
- Is that tea?
- Yeah.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.346
I know I said I wanted you
out of the house for my date tonight,

03:22.418 --> 03:25.182
but you're obviously indisposed,
so don't worry about it.

03:25.255 --> 03:26.347
Thank you.

03:26.422 --> 03:30.483
Just stay in your room so the coughing
and hacking doesn't kill the mood.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.688
Anything else I can do
to enhance your evening?

03:34.097 --> 03:36.429
Well, you know how to
work my camcorder?

03:39.569 --> 03:41.662
I'm bored. What are we gonna do today?

03:41.738 --> 03:45.037
I don't know. Why don't we make
some lunch and figure something out?

03:45.108 --> 03:46.700
- Cool.
- Excuse me?

03:46.776 --> 03:49.438
Hasn't anybody noticed
I'm sick and miserable here?

03:49.545 --> 03:51.445
Yes, Alan, we noticed.

03:51.547 --> 03:53.947
Which is why we're gonna make
like hockey players

03:54.050 --> 03:55.711
and get the puck out of here.

03:56.085 --> 03:59.714
Get it, Dad? Puck's not a bad word,
but it sounds like one.

04:00.189 --> 04:02.054
Yeah, hilarious.

04:02.125 --> 04:05.617
Hey, Uncle Charlie, let's make like
soccer players and get our big

04:05.728 --> 04:07.855
leather balls out of here.

04:08.932 --> 04:10.058
Good one.

04:10.133 --> 04:13.034
You know, I caught this from you.
How come you're not sick?

04:13.102 --> 04:15.127
I am. See?

04:16.773 --> 04:19.139
He's just not being a baby about it.

04:21.209 --> 04:23.201
- Hi.
- Perfect.

04:25.815 --> 04:29.615
Rose, this isn't the best time.
Alan's pretty sick.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.380
Oh, no!

04:32.455 --> 04:36.551
Poor Alan.
Is Charlie taking good care of you?

04:36.626 --> 04:38.059
Not really.

04:39.062 --> 04:41.053
Would you like me to take care of you?

04:41.130 --> 04:42.563
Not really.

04:43.232 --> 04:45.700
Don't be silly. Move over.

04:45.768 --> 04:48.737
Rose, what are you doing?

04:51.240 --> 04:54.801
I'm transmitting healing energy
from my body to yours.

05:00.249 --> 05:03.776
Looks like you're in good hands.
Come on, Jake.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.311
I don't think that's gonna help him.

05:06.422 --> 05:08.253
No, but it helps us.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.095
Is he gonna be able to take me
back to Mom's later?

05:15.164 --> 05:17.655
Don't worry. If he can't, I will.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.465
Hey, how can you tell if an elephant's
been in your refrigerator?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.563
- How?
- There's footprints in the cheesecake.

05:25.008 --> 05:27.442
But we don't have a cheesecake.

05:27.677 --> 05:30.009
That's the part you don't buy?

05:34.984 --> 05:37.350
Do you feel the healing energy?

05:37.854 --> 05:40.789
If I say yes, will you get off me?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.754
- Hello?
- Mom?

05:46.629 --> 05:49.598
For God's sake, Alan, I sit on that couch.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.165
Mom, I'm sick.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.430
We're all sick, darling,
but we use discretion.

05:55.805 --> 05:57.966
No, he has the flu, Evelyn.

05:59.008 --> 06:02.409
You poor baby.
What can Mommy do for you?

06:03.346 --> 06:04.836
It's okay. I'll manage.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.472
Don't be ridiculous.
Now what do you need?

06:07.583 --> 06:10.575
I don't know. I am kind of thirsty.

06:10.653 --> 06:13.417
Well, then,
you should be drinking lots of fluids.

06:14.657 --> 06:15.988
Okay.

06:16.526 --> 06:21.589
Would you like a nice hot bowl
of my special chicken noodle soup?

06:21.664 --> 06:23.029
That would be nice.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.465
Rose, call Greenblatt's
and have them send over some soup.

06:27.003 --> 06:30.632
As a matter of fact, I'm famished.
Order me...

06:31.274 --> 06:34.869
Order me a turkey on rye
with maybe a little Swiss.

06:35.344 --> 06:39.781
On second thought, delivery takes forever.
Would you care to join me for lunch?

06:39.849 --> 06:42.477
Well, what about Alan?

06:42.552 --> 06:44.611
We'll have something sent back for him.

06:45.455 --> 06:46.479
Okay.

06:46.556 --> 06:48.615
So, what's Charlie been up to?

06:48.691 --> 06:51.023
Well, what do you know about
revenge sex?

06:51.127 --> 06:53.027
Quite a bit, actually.

06:57.133 --> 06:58.862
I'm still thirsty.

07:19.789 --> 07:22.349
Hey. Looking good.

07:33.302 --> 07:36.863
That's not very hygienic.
We wash dishes in that sink.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.037
Well, somebody does.

07:40.042 --> 07:43.876
Did the chicken soup Mom sent over
from Greenblatt's ever show up?

07:46.916 --> 07:48.076
Nope.

07:51.587 --> 07:54.715
Well, I'm glad you got some rest,
because I have got great news.

07:54.824 --> 07:57.019
There is no great news.

07:57.093 --> 07:59.653
There's no light at the end of the tunnel.

07:59.929 --> 08:02.363
There is no silver lining.

08:02.431 --> 08:04.922
There is just this hell on earth.

08:05.535 --> 08:10.234
And the slow wait
for the sweet release of death.

08:13.342 --> 08:15.674
Okay. Let's call it good news.

08:17.413 --> 08:21.042
The girl I'm going out with tonight
needs a date for her sister.

08:24.453 --> 08:26.045
Are you insane?

08:26.622 --> 08:29.750
No, but I hear the sister's a bit of a freak.

08:30.893 --> 08:33.191
Jake? Jake, go to your room.

08:33.296 --> 08:36.424
If you want to talk about sex,
why don't you go to your room?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.799
- Now!
- Fine.

08:39.902 --> 08:43.235
First of all, I don't want to talk
about dating in front of my son

08:43.306 --> 08:45.866
while his mother and I
are in the middle of a divorce.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.070
Okay. That's very caring and sensitive.

08:49.145 --> 08:52.706
Now let me tell you about
Revenge Sex's little sister, Casual.

08:54.250 --> 08:58.448
Alright, even if I weren't deathly ill,
which I am,

08:58.821 --> 09:01.585
I wouldn't go on a blind double date
with you.

09:01.657 --> 09:04.626
- Why not?
- Summer of my junior year?

09:04.727 --> 09:07.093
The Seals and Crofts concert?

09:07.196 --> 09:11.530
You got the incredible cheerleader
and I got her sister, The Incredible Hulk?

09:15.137 --> 09:16.798
She really took a shine to you.

09:16.906 --> 09:19.966
Sure did. "Sarah like puny Alan. "

09:20.376 --> 09:23.368
You weren't complaining
when you were on her shoulders

09:23.446 --> 09:25.437
<i>shouting Summer Breeze!</i>

09:26.148 --> 09:28.139
Forget it, Charlie, forget it.

09:28.251 --> 09:32.210
Alan, trust me. I've seen the sister.
Her name is Desiree.

09:32.288 --> 09:33.812
I don't care what her name is.

09:33.923 --> 09:37.723
Desiree, Alan. That's like desire
with a "yay" at the end.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.722
- She's an actress on some soap opera.
- Really, which one?

09:42.798 --> 09:45.733
<i>I don't know.
The Bold and the Bulimic, or something.</i>

09:45.801 --> 09:47.132
Are you guys done yet?

09:47.236 --> 09:48.294
Yeah, we're done.

09:48.404 --> 09:50.634
Now we're gonna get your father
back on his feet.

09:50.740 --> 09:51.764
How?

09:52.174 --> 09:53.402
Well,

09:53.476 --> 09:55.808
would you like to go see a bunch
of naked boobs?

09:55.911 --> 09:57.572
- Sure!
- Charlie!

10:02.218 --> 10:04.948
This was a dirty trick, Uncle Charlie.

10:15.631 --> 10:17.997
So we just sit here and be hot?

10:20.236 --> 10:21.328
Yep.

10:21.804 --> 10:23.237
This sucks.

10:28.277 --> 10:32.407
That's good. Get it out now,
because most women hate that noise.

10:33.983 --> 10:36.247
I'm not going on a date, Charlie.

10:36.319 --> 10:37.684
You don't know that.

10:37.787 --> 10:41.279
I didn't start this day thinking we'd all be
sitting bare-ass naked,

10:41.357 --> 10:43.086
but here we are.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.492
Hey, Dad, want to hear a funny joke?

10:46.962 --> 10:48.122
Sure, why not?

10:48.197 --> 10:50.791
Okay, there's a priest,
a minister, and a rabbit.

10:50.866 --> 10:52.663
It's a rabbi, Jake.

10:53.336 --> 10:54.860
Oh, yeah. Okay.

10:54.970 --> 10:57.461
A priest, a minister, and a rabbi.

10:58.207 --> 11:01.335
I forgot the rest.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

11:01.644 --> 11:02.770
Wait.

11:02.845 --> 11:05.643
You know why they call this
a European health spa?

11:05.715 --> 11:07.808
Because you're a-peein'.

11:09.819 --> 11:12.310
He's gonna kill at school tomorrow.

11:12.388 --> 11:14.879
Charlie, I'm not going on a date.

11:14.990 --> 11:16.890
Oh, come on, Alan.

11:16.992 --> 11:19.984
If you don't do this, then I'm not
gonna get the revenge sex.

11:20.062 --> 11:23.225
And I really want the revenge sex.
I really do.

11:24.033 --> 11:27.366
I'm sorry.
It's not that I don't appreciate you,

11:27.470 --> 11:29.904
pimping me out on my deathbed.

11:30.005 --> 11:33.372
It's just that I'm not ready to date.

11:33.476 --> 11:34.636
Not ready?

11:34.710 --> 11:38.578
If you think you're protecting Jake
by living like a monk, you're wrong.

11:38.681 --> 11:42.549
He needs to know that his father's
moving on with his life, that he's happy.

11:42.651 --> 11:46.348
It's not about Jake.
I haven't been on a date since college.

11:46.422 --> 11:48.913
There's nothing to worry about.
Just be yourself.

11:49.024 --> 11:53.358
The one woman who knows me better
than anyone in the world threw me out.

11:53.429 --> 11:56.865
So "be yourself"
is not exactly comforting advice.

11:58.267 --> 11:59.734
Good point.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.435
Okay, look at it this way.

12:03.839 --> 12:06.433
It took your wife 12 years
to get sick of you.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.705
All we gotta do here
is snow some broad for one night.

12:11.247 --> 12:14.580
A priest, a minister, and a rabbi
walk into a barn.

12:16.018 --> 12:18.953
It's a bar, Jake. Not a barn. A bar.

12:19.054 --> 12:20.521
It is?

12:21.123 --> 12:23.284
Now I get it. That's funny.

12:32.768 --> 12:36.204
Okay, I dropped Jake off at his mom's,

12:36.272 --> 12:39.298
and the girls should be here
in a little while for drinks.

12:39.408 --> 12:41.273
Is this the sister?

12:41.377 --> 12:44.039
<i>Desiree Barrington from
The Young and the Restless?</i>

12:44.113 --> 12:45.205
Yeah.

12:45.281 --> 12:49.775
You want me to go on a date
with Desiree Barrington?

12:50.419 --> 12:51.579
Yeah.

12:57.426 --> 12:59.326
I'm healed. It's a miracle.

12:59.929 --> 13:01.226
Attaboy.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.899
Are you okay?

13:05.968 --> 13:07.128
Yeah. Why?

13:07.236 --> 13:10.000
Well, you're coughing, you're sweating.

13:11.774 --> 13:13.674
Charlie, you're burning up.

13:13.776 --> 13:15.903
No, your hand is freezing.

13:17.413 --> 13:20.348
I think you're coming down
with what I've got.

13:20.449 --> 13:23.680
Don't be ridiculous. I never get sick.

13:23.786 --> 13:26.914
Now, listen, I made reservations
at the Ivy.

13:26.989 --> 13:30.481
I figure we'll take them out
for an early dinner and then...

13:36.198 --> 13:37.756
And then what?

13:38.634 --> 13:40.329
Hang on a second.

14:01.690 --> 14:04.454
Anyway, we'll take them to the Ivy...

14:14.870 --> 14:17.737
Here. This'll make you feel better.

14:21.043 --> 14:22.305
Thanks.

14:23.646 --> 14:24.806
Okay.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.371
Why don't you go upstairs and change

14:27.483 --> 14:30.884
because we really want to look our best
for our dates.

14:30.986 --> 14:33.887
What are you talking about?
I'm not going on a date.

14:33.989 --> 14:35.581
Yeah, you are.

14:35.691 --> 14:38.182
Come on, Charlie. Desiree Barrington.

14:38.260 --> 14:41.093
Nominated for two Daytime Emmys.

14:41.196 --> 14:44.393
<i>Named "Most Promising Ingénue"
by Soap Opera Digest.</i>

14:44.700 --> 14:47.897
<i>She totally revitalized
Young and the Restless.</i>

14:49.004 --> 14:52.030
Occasionally I have lunch at my desk
and watch a little TV.

14:54.343 --> 14:56.538
Tell Jake I loved him.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.911
Please, Charlie.
I was gonna suck it up for you.

15:01.016 --> 15:02.677
No, you weren't.

15:03.118 --> 15:04.847
Okay, you got me.

15:05.688 --> 15:08.885
Look, you helped me feel better,

15:08.958 --> 15:10.721
and now I'll help you.

15:10.793 --> 15:12.522
You want to help me, Alan?

15:12.595 --> 15:15.189
Find a gun and shoot me in the eye.

15:16.031 --> 15:19.967
No, I was thinking I could give you
a chiropractic adjustment.

15:20.069 --> 15:23.698
You could also do my hair,
but what would be the point?

15:23.806 --> 15:26.900
Chiropractics
is not just about back ailments.

15:26.976 --> 15:30.036
It's a holistic approach
to wellness that includes

15:30.112 --> 15:32.580
unblocking pathways
in the nervous system

15:32.648 --> 15:35.139
so that the body can heal itself.

15:39.288 --> 15:42.086
Excuse me? What is...

15:43.325 --> 15:46.294
Alan. I never told you this before,

15:47.096 --> 15:49.997
but I guess now is as good a time as any.

15:51.667 --> 15:55.728
I think what you do for a living
is a total crock.

15:57.973 --> 15:59.167
What?

15:59.642 --> 16:01.337
Don't take it personally.

16:01.443 --> 16:03.468
But you chiropractor guys are just

16:03.579 --> 16:06.514
masseuses without the happy endings,
right?

16:07.916 --> 16:09.850
You think I'm some kind of phony?

16:09.952 --> 16:12.944
That my profession is some kind of con?

16:13.022 --> 16:14.455
Well, let's be honest.

16:14.523 --> 16:18.357
You only became a chiropractor because
you couldn't get into medical school.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.451
I got into medical school!

16:20.529 --> 16:23.760
I just didn't want to spend four years
in Guadalajara.

16:24.767 --> 16:28.794
So instead you spent, what,
two weeks at Back Snapper U?

16:29.638 --> 16:31.606
It was two years.

16:31.674 --> 16:33.005
And since we're being honest,

16:33.108 --> 16:37.477
let me tell you about what I think about
what you do, Mr. Jingle Writer.

16:37.546 --> 16:41.710
You're not a musician, you're a salesman.
You know what you sell?

16:42.017 --> 16:43.314
Crap!

16:44.119 --> 16:47.020
Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?
Maple Loops?

16:47.122 --> 16:51.354
Hey, Maple Loops is part of a nutritious,
balanced breakfast.

16:51.460 --> 16:54.793
Yeah, if you eat it with a steak
and some broccoli.

16:55.364 --> 16:58.697
And let me tell you another thing.
You had a shot at a real career.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.462
You could've played in great bands.

17:00.536 --> 17:02.697
You could've been a respected
studio musician.

17:02.805 --> 17:04.636
Don't you think I wanted that?

17:04.707 --> 17:06.971
I tried, Alan, and I failed.

17:07.476 --> 17:10.877
The truth is, if I hadn't started
writing jingles, I'd be playing

17:10.979 --> 17:14.243
faculty mixers
at the Guadalajara Medical School.

17:16.919 --> 17:19.911
Since you're being honest,
I guess I can admit,

17:20.888 --> 17:23.585
I didn't really get into Guadalajara.

17:25.426 --> 17:29.830
I guess neither of us is doing exactly what
we dreamed about when we were kids.

17:29.898 --> 17:31.365
I guess not.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.765
But you know,
we could be doing a lot worse.

17:33.869 --> 17:35.496
Yes, we could.

17:37.106 --> 17:38.505
Excuse me.

17:59.461 --> 18:01.759
You know what's nice, though?

18:06.368 --> 18:08.768
This. Right now.

18:08.871 --> 18:12.068
Taking care of each other,
like we did when we were kids.

18:12.141 --> 18:15.235
Well, no one else was gonna
take care of us.

18:15.711 --> 18:18.305
- We were on our own.
- Yeah.

18:18.447 --> 18:20.711
Dad was gone and Mom was...

18:22.651 --> 18:25.085
What are you doing? Hey!

18:28.090 --> 18:29.751
How do you feel?

18:31.960 --> 18:34.087
Actually, a little better.

18:34.997 --> 18:38.763
Total crock, huh?
Lay down, I'll do your back.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.962
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- No, really, it'll help.

18:42.070 --> 18:44.903
I mean it, Alan.
Keep your hands away from me.

18:44.973 --> 18:46.907
Come on, don't be such a baby.

18:46.975 --> 18:50.433
I'm not a baby.
I just don't like a man touching me.

18:51.246 --> 18:53.476
I let you do it to me once,
that was enough.

18:53.582 --> 18:56.483
And you liked it. Now come on,
just let me finish the job,

18:56.585 --> 18:59.418
and you'll be ready
for when the women get here.

19:00.355 --> 19:02.755
- No.
- Just relax. Come on.

19:03.158 --> 19:05.353
Wait. Car doors.

19:05.794 --> 19:07.284
They're here.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.523
How do I look?

19:16.438 --> 19:18.770
Good. Me?

19:18.841 --> 19:20.331
Very nice.

19:27.850 --> 19:28.942
Thank you.

19:50.906 --> 19:52.840
Was that the doorbell?

19:53.709 --> 19:56.803
Alan, relax. Chicks are always late.

19:56.879 --> 19:58.540
I guess.

20:00.816 --> 20:02.181
What about that?

20:03.151 --> 20:05.517
- What about what?
- The doorbell.

20:06.922 --> 20:10.688
Alan, relax. Chicks are always late.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.857
I guess.

20:16.231 --> 20:18.392
Now, that was the doorbell.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.190
