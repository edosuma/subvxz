00:28.987 --> 00:29.946
Hey!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.490
What are you doing in here?

00:33.700 --> 00:34.784
Hello?

00:36.202 --> 00:38.038
Look, this is private property.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.247
You can't just be…

00:40.999 --> 00:42.000
Hey.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.127
Can you hear me?

00:47.005 --> 00:48.131
Jesus.

00:49.799 --> 00:50.759
Hello?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.306
What in the…

01:13.990 --> 01:14.824
Wake up.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.743
Come on! Wake up!

01:20.121 --> 01:21.456
Come on! Wake up!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.604
911, what's your emergency?

01:46.272 --> 01:49.192
There's… I'm the housekeeper.
There's a girl here.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.486
I don't know what's wrong,
but we need help!

02:26.771 --> 02:27.772
Wow.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.526
Looks exactly the same…

02:32.026 --> 02:33.319
-Hey.
-Hi.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.239
…but fixed up.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.533
-Yeah, my mom does renovations.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.329
You can look around if you want.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.543
Wow.

02:49.085 --> 02:52.547
I know it must be
a little weird for you to be back here.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.176
Yeah, but in a good way.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.724
Thank you for letting me stay here
until my trust fund comes through.

03:02.807 --> 03:03.850
Of course.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.268
It shouldn't take too long.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.644
How's she doing?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.354
She didn't say much on the drive.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.274
She remembers the keys and magic, right?
We need to find out how--

03:11.357 --> 03:12.942
Yeah, but we need to take it easy.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.278
She needs time to process.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.573
We can't just start
hammering her with questions.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.660
Hi, I'm Bode.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.746
Hey, I'm Erin. It's cool to meet you.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.128
And this is gonna be your room.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.171
Thanks.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.303
Duncan?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.015
Is that you?

03:45.975 --> 03:47.852
Hey… Erin.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.147
Welcome. I… I heard that you were
gonna be staying with us.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.274
Uh, sorry, I'm on Tokyo time.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.527
Wow.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.947
You're old now.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.909
Uh-- I'm, um… I'm sorry.

04:02.992 --> 04:03.868
Uh…

04:04.577 --> 04:08.206
In my head, you're still
this little kid, you know, running around.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.837
I was actually just gonna have a shower,
so I'm gonna… I'm gonna go do that.

04:15.505 --> 04:19.801
Okay, but we'll, uh… we'll catch up later.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.053
Yeah.

04:28.726 --> 04:32.188
Okay, um, hopefully,
you're all set in there.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.399
Bode and I are heading out
for a few hours,

04:34.482 --> 04:36.484
but Kinsey and Tyler will be here.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.903
Let us know if you need anything else.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.448
Erin?

04:44.367 --> 04:45.326
Are you okay?

04:47.328 --> 04:48.955
I know you found the keys.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.624
I need you to give them to me.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.709
All of them.

04:54.210 --> 04:58.256
Yeah, I should have gotten rid of them
right after it happened.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.216
-Right after my friends died.
-We…

05:00.842 --> 05:03.553
We're being careful.
We… We know how to use them.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.014
We thought we did too.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.766
We thought we knew what we were doing.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.351
I'm sorry.

05:10.435 --> 05:14.105
Look, I know a lot of bad things happened,
but it's different now.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.691
You know, we got rid of Dodge.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.776
Oh, it's not just about Dodge.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.820
The keys,

05:21.779 --> 05:24.532
their… their power, it seduces you.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.243
Oh, you have to listen to me.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.078
Erin, with all due respect,

05:29.162 --> 05:30.371
we're Lockes.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.457
The keys belong to us.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.084
We get to decide what to do with them.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.920
Then you are not gonna survive.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.978
Um, so much for
"she needs time to process."

05:54.062 --> 05:55.772
I get that she's freaked out.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.774
This is a lot for her.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.777
I… I get that too. I just…

06:02.445 --> 06:03.946
We're not giving her the keys.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.156
Obviously.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.118
Hello, tiny key.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.692
Hey, Bode, where are you?

08:04.775 --> 08:06.235
We gotta go to Jamie's.

08:07.695 --> 08:11.115
The hospital
was going to move her into a motel.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.367
Uh, that just seemed cruel.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.455
She should be in a place
with positive associations.

08:17.538 --> 08:21.042
Right, and what's more positive
than her old boyfriend's house?

08:22.376 --> 08:24.420
-I'm kidding. It's…

08:26.631 --> 08:29.467
No, I think it's great. I think it's great
that you took her in. I do.

08:29.550 --> 08:34.263
But you don't have to be a saint about it.
You can feel weird about it.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.848
Oh, I don't feel weird.

08:37.683 --> 08:42.230
Yeah, okay.
I… I feel a little weird.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.523
Uh-huh.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.401
All right.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.445
One, two, three, four--

08:49.529 --> 08:50.655
Whoa!

08:50.738 --> 08:51.948
Ugh.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.370
Ugh, spiders are
my second least favorite bug.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.122
Maybe he can help you with the rent.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.250
Seventeen hundred smackers.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.460
Boardwalk?

09:05.169 --> 09:06.337
Oh no.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.924
Oh my God.
I can't believe you got that.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.886
-These playdates have been great.
-So great. Um…

09:18.140 --> 09:19.850
But I was thinking, um,

09:20.893 --> 09:24.105
how would you feel about having a playdate

09:25.064 --> 09:26.607
but where the kids stay home?

09:29.652 --> 09:30.778
That sounds good.

09:33.948 --> 09:34.865
Yeah.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.786
I wanna show you something.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.708
Whoa. Is that a new one?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.502
Yeah, I found it today.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.338
I haven't been able to figure out
what it does just yet.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.554
Come with me.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.851
See that door?

10:01.934 --> 10:04.061
It has the same initials as the key.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.981
Whoa. This is freaky.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.066
That's my house.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.652
-It is?
-Yeah.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.780
The "KH" stands for Keyhouse.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.533
Where did you find this?

10:18.034 --> 10:21.495
My dad collects a lot of weird,
old history stuff,

10:21.579 --> 10:23.664
especially if it's connected to Matheson.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.541
Think it does magic?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.670
There's only one way to find out.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.189
Whoa!

10:49.190 --> 10:51.400
The roof comes off.
Do you wanna see?

10:56.697 --> 10:57.740
All right.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.543
This is amazing!

11:09.627 --> 11:13.339
That's Tyler's room, and that's…

11:18.386 --> 11:19.470
Tyler?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.642
Hey, Tyler!

11:25.267 --> 11:26.310
Tyler!

11:27.395 --> 11:30.272
So, it shows you
what's going on in your house.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.400
Yeah, I… I guess so.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.777
Which one's your room?

11:34.860 --> 11:35.903
This one.

11:36.904 --> 11:37.822
Oh.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.949
I can just pick up my wardrobe.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.660
Look at how tiny my bed is.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.662
-Oh.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.748
Um, I…

11:48.457 --> 11:50.418
I kind of broke it.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.920
Bode, where are you?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.096
We have to head home in a minute.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.529
Jamie, we should let the Lockes go home.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.451
Is that

12:24.660 --> 12:25.536
-Keyhouse?

12:26.454 --> 12:28.289
Yeah, isn't it cool?

12:30.666 --> 12:32.668
Josh…

12:32.752 --> 12:34.420
Um, what is this?

12:35.087 --> 12:36.130
I can explain.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.550
Explain why you have a…
a model of my house?

12:40.259 --> 12:44.597
When I first moved here, I was hitting up
a lot of the antique stores,

12:44.680 --> 12:48.142
and I picked up this piece for a song.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.645
I should have mentioned it
when I found out that you were a Locke,

12:51.729 --> 12:54.940
but we had such a… a bumpy introduction…

12:58.194 --> 13:00.696
Yeah, I can see now, though,
I should have mentioned it.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.199
It wouldn't have been weird
if I just mentioned it at the time.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.118
Yeah, it still would've been weird.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.620
Huh.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.707
You should take it.
You should have that. It's your house.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.795
Seriously, I insist. You should have it.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.469
No, no, you keep it.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.430
I have a hard enough time
taking care of the big version.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.350
Are you sure, Mom?
I mean, it is our house.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.560
I'm sure. It's time to go, bud.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.854
-Can I just take another look?
-Another time.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.481
Come on, Bode. Let's go.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.608
All right, thanks for a lovely time.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.944
-Keep it safe.
-I will.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.279
-Bye, Jamie.
-Bye.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.365
-Bye, Josh.
-Bye.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.674
Okay, that's gotta be done by now.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.135
Chamberlin said
the iron had to be free of impurities.

14:05.761 --> 14:06.720
Hmm?

14:07.471 --> 14:09.890
-You see those little black flecks?
-Mm-hmm.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.892
Those look like impurities to me.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.228
Stir.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.481
What are you gonna do?

14:18.566 --> 14:20.150
Kinsey's pulling away from me.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.069
-I need to fix that.
-Why?

14:22.152 --> 14:24.488
We can make our own keys now.
What's the point?

14:24.572 --> 14:25.614
She's a Locke.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.408
-She's special.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.328
I don't see you fawning
over Tyler and Bode.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.747
Someone catching feelings?

14:48.345 --> 14:50.139
We all gotta be thinking
about ways

14:50.222 --> 14:51.849
we can make our sequel even better.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.768
I was thinking we could shoot
at the North Shore Maritime Museum.

14:54.852 --> 14:58.147
I went over the summer.
It's kind of a perfect location.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.025
Oh yeah. I'll see any movie
with a scene in a maritime museum.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.612
Abby, my phone's dead.
See if there's any pictures.

15:06.196 --> 15:10.034
Wow, this place looks great.
Killer production value.

15:10.659 --> 15:13.746
Here. Scot, do you have anything
in the script that could work here?

15:18.125 --> 15:19.585
Hmm? What?

15:20.127 --> 15:22.087
Uh, sorry, what we talking about?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.006
The movie.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.216
Right. Yeah.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.135
Um…

15:28.218 --> 15:30.304
Um… Yeah. No, I was thinking--

15:30.387 --> 15:33.307
About your new school and the friends
you'll have that aren't as cool as us?

15:33.390 --> 15:34.642
No.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.562
Yeah, he's gonna be rubbing elbows
with all these insane film prodigies.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.106
Probably just forget all about us.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.736
Well, until then,

15:46.612 --> 15:48.697
stuck with you lot.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.617
I did my bimonthly rewatch

15:51.700 --> 15:54.203
of Attack of the Crab Monsters
last night for inspiration.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.385
Wanna come in?

16:15.599 --> 16:17.267
This is my dad's old room, right?

16:17.768 --> 16:18.894
Mm-hmm.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.442
Oh my God.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.073
Rendell used to wear this all the time.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.076
Seriously, who…

16:35.411 --> 16:38.205
who puts a fishing lure on a baseball cap?

16:39.581 --> 16:41.000
He said he had it there just

16:41.083 --> 16:43.335
in case of emergency.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.550
Can I ask you a question?

16:50.050 --> 16:51.343
Yeah, shoot.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.809
How are you all able to remember magic?

16:58.892 --> 17:01.103
You, and… and Ellie, and my dad?

17:06.984 --> 17:08.068
We made a key.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.322
Made a key? Uh--

17:13.323 --> 17:14.199
How?

17:14.283 --> 17:15.200
Doesn't matter.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.661
We never should have done it
in the first place.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.289
Where is it right now?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.958
I don't know. I really don't.
I mean, that's the truth.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.836
-Where was the last place you saw it?
-Tyler, we're home.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.255
I could use a hand with dinner.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.302
Please just forget about the keys.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.111
What the…

18:06.168 --> 18:07.628
Holy crap!

18:18.388 --> 18:20.265
Jamie, look at my bed!

18:20.349 --> 18:21.225
It's broken.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.603
How did you break your…

18:24.686 --> 18:25.854
Wait.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.897
It's just like--

18:26.980 --> 18:28.065
The dollhouse.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.111
Look, my wardrobe fell over too.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.366
It doesn't just show you what's going on.

18:37.950 --> 18:42.579
Whatever you do in the dollhouse
actually happens in Keyhouse.

18:43.163 --> 18:46.041
Whoa. Good thing
you didn't smoosh your brother.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.628
-Quick. Put something in the dollhouse.
-Like what?

18:49.711 --> 18:52.631
-I don't know, something small.
-Okay, one minute.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.925
I have to roll the dollhouse into my room.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.345
-You still have the key, right?
-Of course I do.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.097
Just making sure.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.098
Oh jeez.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.357
Did it work?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.442
Oh my God.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.236
It did!

19:14.862 --> 19:16.280
Yes!

19:25.789 --> 19:27.207
And it's delicious.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.254
Tomorrow we'll start working
on the script

19:32.337 --> 19:34.256
and come up with a schedule. Sound good?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.342
Gabe can you gimme a hand
getting the Nephropidae outfit

19:37.426 --> 19:38.302
out of my mom's van?

19:38.385 --> 19:40.637
-It's starting to creep her out.
-Uh…

19:42.973 --> 19:44.349
-Yeah, sure.
-Just two seconds.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.392
Yeah, I got you.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.269
Be right back.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.902
I'm sure everyone at Rochester
isn't a prodigy.

19:54.985 --> 19:55.944
Mmm.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.405
Maybe just, like, 80%.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.202
Besides, you were the visionary
behind The Splattering

20:03.285 --> 20:06.788
and soon to be The Splattering 2,
better title forthcoming.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.081
Hmm.

20:08.165 --> 20:12.544
Yeah, you wanna see what this visionary
has actually written of The Splattering 2?

20:15.714 --> 20:16.673
That's it.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.092
Okay. So you got a scene.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.303
I've got half a scene, Kinsey,
and it's crap.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.722
Sorry, I just…

20:23.805 --> 20:27.643
If I can't handle this, how the hell
am I gonna handle film school?

20:27.726 --> 20:29.937
-If I even get in.
-You're too much in your head.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.357
If you have complete confidence
in your art all the time,

20:33.440 --> 20:34.858
you're probably a sociopath.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.111
That is true.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.572
Look, you don't have to do this
on your own.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.698
Let me help.

20:42.866 --> 20:43.825
-Really?
-Yeah!

20:43.909 --> 20:46.286
Let's not overthink it.
Let's go with the flow.

20:47.037 --> 20:47.996
Okay, cool.

20:49.122 --> 20:53.377
-Okay, act one, scene one.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.298
Eerie music plays over shots.

20:58.382 --> 21:02.094
-Spooky maritime museum.
-Abandoned maritime museum.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.012
-Oh, I like it.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.730
I'm taking over.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.901
Thank God.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.404
Because you are going to Keyhouse.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.492
For what?

21:26.159 --> 21:28.078
Tip the scales back in my favor.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.914
-Now.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.259
-Hey.
-Morning.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.720
You want some cereal?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.263
No. Um…

21:47.389 --> 21:49.975
I'm actually just heading out
to work on my car.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.572
You don't remember much about me, do you?

22:06.450 --> 22:07.743
Not really. No.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.247
Yeah, that whole time
is a bit of a blank for me.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.586
I'm really sorry.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.756
What are you sorry about?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.301
I just am.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.893
I better get to work.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.367
Scot, this opening museum scene
is awesome.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.534
Very Corman-esque.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.328
Seriously, sequels are tough,

22:51.411 --> 22:54.623
and this has the potential to be
more Aliens less Grease 2.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.625
Uh, excuse me, Grease 2 is a masterpiece.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.086
See? And you thought you'd lost your mojo.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.088
Thanks, guys. Thank you.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.176
Where's the rest?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.470
Ah, it's coming.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.348
Wait. This is it.
You've been writing this for weeks.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.767
I know. Uh, I had a little bit

23:13.850 --> 23:17.062
of a creative existential crisis
to contend with, but don't fret.

23:17.145 --> 23:20.315
I promise. It's all up here.
I just gotta get it down on here.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.317
Okay. Well, maybe we can get an outline?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.569
That way, if you're gone,
we have something to work with.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.280
No, there's no need.
I promise I can do this.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.782
No, she's right.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.785
I mean, whoever is gonna fill in for you
is gonna need it.

23:32.661 --> 23:36.039
I'm assuming that's you, right?
You have been running this whole thing.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.041
-Hold on.
-I'm not up for consideration?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.085
-Hold on.
-Didn't know you wanted to direct.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.878
I don't. I just wanna be considered.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.297
You don't have
the obvious leadership qualities--

23:44.381 --> 23:45.715
You're throwing Zadie out there.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.926
-What about you? What about Kinsey?
-Whoa! Hold on!

23:48.009 --> 23:50.011
You're acting like I've already left!

23:51.763 --> 23:54.975
I'm still here,
and I'm still the director.

23:55.559 --> 23:59.020
Dude, if you get into
Rochester, which I'm sure you will,

24:00.564 --> 24:02.357
you don't wanna leave us hanging, do you?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.483
Yeah.

24:04.901 --> 24:09.614
It might actually be a good idea
to discuss other scenarios. Just in case.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.200
-I'm being cut out of my own film, am I?
-No.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.910
You're trying to keep one foot
in the movie

24:13.994 --> 24:15.579
while the other one's already in England.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.749
You're being a little…
You're being a little selfish.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.836
-Scot, what the hell?
-Whoa!

24:22.919 --> 24:24.087
What are you doing?

24:24.671 --> 24:26.590
I don't know.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.175
-Dude!
-Whoa!

24:28.258 --> 24:29.509
Scot.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.094
-Scot.
-Whoa.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.429
Yo, chill out.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.599
-Scot, walk at Gabe aggressively.
-What the hell?

24:37.225 --> 24:39.352
Can we just-- Relax.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.021
-Scot, punch Gabe.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.522
I'm not doing anything.

24:43.106 --> 24:45.233
-Oh my God, stop it!

24:45.317 --> 24:46.902
-Get off him!

24:47.569 --> 24:49.070
What the hell, Scot?

24:50.655 --> 24:53.116
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do that. That wasn't me!

24:53.200 --> 24:56.328
-It wasn't me. I didn't do that.
-Cavendish! Let's go. Outta here.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.871
Come on. You're outta here.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.499
-Kinsey, I didn't do that.
-Come on.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.459
-Here.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.544
What's the matter with you?

25:04.628 --> 25:08.048
-Are you okay? That was crazy.
-I'm… I'm fine. Seriously.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.218
We should go see him.
Make sure he's not strangling Mr. Bennett.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.011
-Okay.
-Glad you're all right.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.139
I've never seen him do
anything like that.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.976
-Hey, are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah, I'm… Seriously, I'm fine.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.478
Can we just forget about it?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.939
Why would he do that?

25:27.984 --> 25:28.985
Oh my God.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.531
What if someone was controlling him?

25:33.865 --> 25:34.824
The music box.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.661
Didn't you lose that key?

25:38.828 --> 25:40.497
Maybe somebody found it.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.375
And what?
Broke into your house and brought it here?

25:48.296 --> 25:49.965
I guess anything's possible.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.759
-Let's go. Shoot! Shoot!

25:52.842 --> 25:53.885
I'll be right back.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.804
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.013
Was a hell of a break.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.397
Hey, what's up?

26:05.480 --> 26:08.024
Uncle Duncan, can you do me a favor
and go up to my room?

26:08.608 --> 26:10.026
Sure. What am I looking for?

26:10.110 --> 26:12.487
Can you see if my music box
is still on my dresser?

26:14.573 --> 26:15.407
You're welcome.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.910
Now's not the time to gloat.
You need to get that back to Keyhouse.

26:19.828 --> 26:20.662
Now.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.247
Now!

26:22.330 --> 26:23.415
Okay.

26:26.876 --> 26:27.794
Mm-hmm.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.035
The music box?

27:01.536 --> 27:02.621
Uh…

27:04.247 --> 27:06.666
The one with the creepy
headless ballerina?

27:08.710 --> 27:09.711
Yeah, it's here.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.298
You sure?

27:14.549 --> 27:16.635
Yes, I'm sure.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.807
You gonna be home for dinner?

27:22.891 --> 27:25.435
Your mom's going out,
and I was gonna make cacio e pepe.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.901
Mmm.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.445
Yeah, should be good.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.822
It's one of my specialties.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.671
He says it's there.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.800
Maybe it is my fault.
I did call him selfish.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.219
He was being selfish and stubborn.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.682
You know, enough about Scot.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.059
Do you wanna?

28:06.142 --> 28:07.060
Sure.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.589
Ugh!

29:29.642 --> 29:31.770
-This place is great.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.355
Gotta love this small-town charm.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.566
Yeah, I do.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.234
It's in the blood.

29:39.402 --> 29:42.655
You know that some of my ancestors
spent time in Matheson.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.073
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.826
So you've been burying the lede here.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.912
Local Matheson boy comes home.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.414
To a place he's never been before.

29:53.625 --> 29:57.837
My wife liked to go
to warmer places when we traveled.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.506
That makes sense.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.674
I mean, when Chicago is your baseline.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.009
Exactly.

30:05.678 --> 30:06.805
What was she like?

30:08.515 --> 30:11.726
Well, Jamie is a lot
like Nicole, actually.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.687
No tolerance for bullshit.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.440
Headstrong.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.861
Quick to tell me when my lecture
is getting boring.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.780
She was a wonderful mom.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.786
Did she, um, get sick?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.122
Um…

30:34.457 --> 30:35.333
Car crash.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.168
Oh.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.003
My God.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.882
I'm sorry.

30:42.966 --> 30:43.925
Yeah, well…

30:46.177 --> 30:50.223
I think when you lose someone suddenly
like that, well, you know.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.601
You know better than anyone.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.437
It leaves a lot unsaid.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.070
Sometimes…

31:05.864 --> 31:07.991
I find myself talking to Rendell

31:09.367 --> 31:10.910
out loud.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.249
It's pretty crazy, right?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.961
Well, if you're crazy,
I'm crazy.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.551
Okay.

31:26.634 --> 31:30.054
No more sad stories.
It's time to show me what you got.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.390
-Okay.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.976
-Okay.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.023
-It's gonna be very unimpressive.

31:45.236 --> 31:49.616
A less secure man may feel bad
that you beat him by 50 points.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.701
Fifty-four, but whatever.

31:52.785 --> 31:55.997
Even though you tried to foul me
for throwing too slowly.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.207
-I don't make the rules.

31:58.917 --> 31:59.918
Oh.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.253
Well…

32:02.921 --> 32:04.339
…this is me.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.090
Oh, I'm parked over there.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.099
I had a great time.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.018
Me too.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.689
-Um…
-Uh…

32:21.773 --> 32:23.399
Oh God.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.735
Why do I feel like a nervous teenager?

32:26.569 --> 32:27.779
Well, speaking for myself,

32:27.862 --> 32:30.657
I was a teenager
the last time I was doing this.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.497
And, um, what are we doing exactly?

33:21.958 --> 33:22.792
Hmm.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.352
Where the hell have you been?

33:43.604 --> 33:44.814
Where have I been?

33:45.314 --> 33:46.983
I had to walk from Keyhouse

33:47.483 --> 33:50.445
through the forest in my heels.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.947
I tried calling an Uber,

33:53.531 --> 33:58.161
but no one would pick me up
because I have a 1.3-star rating.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.665
And you walked because?

34:05.126 --> 34:09.130
Because of that little fetch quest
that you sent me on,

34:11.299 --> 34:13.551
Kinsey's uncle now has the Anywhere Key.

34:13.634 --> 34:14.677
That's on you.

34:26.189 --> 34:27.106
Doesn't matter.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.820
Soon enough,

34:34.447 --> 34:36.199
we'll have the only key that we need.

34:38.034 --> 34:38.993
Thank you.

34:39.494 --> 34:40.995
-Hup.
-Hup?

34:41.079 --> 34:42.872
-Is that your name?
-Mm-hmm. Hup!

34:43.664 --> 34:45.124
Oh, let me help you.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.882
Thank God.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.884
-I'm a Gelfling.
-I'm starving.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.065
Ha ha, Tyler. Very funny.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.714
What the…

35:40.179 --> 35:41.097
Uh, Tyler?

35:41.180 --> 35:42.431
I know. Dinner.

35:42.515 --> 35:43.850
Can you come out here?

35:44.433 --> 35:45.393
I'm coming.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.938
What did you do?

35:49.021 --> 35:50.314
It wasn't me.

35:54.902 --> 35:55.903
Uh…

35:58.197 --> 35:59.240
Uh…

36:42.950 --> 36:45.745
-Run!

36:52.126 --> 36:53.794
Okay, we can't stay here.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.014
What's going on up here?

37:05.514 --> 37:07.308
-Come with us!

37:11.896 --> 37:14.565
-The… The Small World Key.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.401
-You know about this key?
-What… What key?

37:22.865 --> 37:23.991
Maybe it's gone.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.494
How do we stop it?

37:45.221 --> 37:46.764
-Come on! Go!
-Run!

37:47.348 --> 37:48.349
Come on!

37:52.853 --> 37:54.397
Close the door!

37:54.480 --> 37:56.899
Why is there a giant spider in our house?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.943
I'll explain later!

38:05.283 --> 38:07.159
Pick up, Jamie! Pick up!

38:13.082 --> 38:14.375
-Oh!

38:14.458 --> 38:16.210
Jamie, pick up!

38:20.006 --> 38:20.840
Hello?

38:20.923 --> 38:24.385
Hey, Jamie, there's a giant spider
attacking us right now,

38:24.468 --> 38:26.637
which means
there's a spider in the dollhouse!

38:26.721 --> 38:27.680
Take the key out

38:27.763 --> 38:28.723
now!

38:32.601 --> 38:33.728
Did it work?

38:35.229 --> 38:37.982
No! Just smash it! Kill it!

38:38.065 --> 38:41.569
No, no! The key has to be
in the dollhouse for it to work!

38:41.652 --> 38:43.237
Put the key back in,

38:43.321 --> 38:44.572
then smash it!

38:50.870 --> 38:52.788
Oh!

38:55.708 --> 38:57.418
-Is it dead?

38:58.794 --> 39:00.046
Oh no.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.507
Yeah, it's dead.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.723
Now we…

39:11.724 --> 39:15.770
we just have a spider
the size of a Volkswagen in our kitchen.

39:17.813 --> 39:22.360
Uh, Jamie, could you maybe help out
with the cleanup?

39:30.993 --> 39:32.244
Thanks.

39:44.507 --> 39:48.135
Well, Mom is going to kill us.

39:49.303 --> 39:53.808
Okay, can someone explain
how that was even possible?

39:55.851 --> 39:56.769
Um…

39:58.479 --> 40:00.231
I'll just give you a few seconds.

40:00.314 --> 40:03.067
What do you mean?
Why would that make a differ…

40:07.738 --> 40:09.407
What happened to my cacio e pepe?

40:12.451 --> 40:13.828
And the rest of this place?

40:17.623 --> 40:18.666
Hey, Duncan.

40:18.749 --> 40:22.336
Listen, you remember your old dollhouse?

40:22.420 --> 40:23.838
I never had a dollhouse.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.257
Yeah, you did. It was in your old bedroom.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.384
What are you talking about?

40:28.467 --> 40:30.428
I don't even know you, Erin.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.350
Please, stop pretending like you know me.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.910
Holy shit! What did I miss?

40:56.454 --> 40:57.955
-The giant rat skull.

40:58.747 --> 40:59.832
What?

41:00.416 --> 41:03.085
The giant rat skull
Bode found on the third floor.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.212
Think that was a dollhouse incident too?

41:07.006 --> 41:07.840
Yeah.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.014
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:17.391 --> 41:21.437
I know what I said about the keys,
but this is an exception.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.899
I need to borrow the Plant Key.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.446
We lost it to Dodge.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.326
But I know what you're looking for.

41:44.084 --> 41:45.836
We found them a few months ago.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.132
We understand why you had to do it.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.852
We were about to turn 18.

42:03.646 --> 42:05.397
We didn't wanna forget magic.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.068
Right, so you made a key, but how--

42:09.151 --> 42:11.070
Tyler, let her explain.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.699
Rendell became obsessed
with opening the Black Door.

42:16.659 --> 42:20.996
He thought it was the source of the magic,
and by opening it,

42:21.080 --> 42:23.666
we could get what we needed
to make another key.

42:25.292 --> 42:26.502
He wasn't wrong.

42:28.462 --> 42:31.757
When we opened the door,
there were these bullets.

42:32.299 --> 42:33.801
One of them hit Lucas.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.471
Turned him into one of those things.

42:39.431 --> 42:42.518
But there were other bullets
that didn't find a host.

42:43.102 --> 42:46.272
Pieces of metal that can be melted down
and turned into…

42:47.731 --> 42:48.941
another key.

42:50.901 --> 42:53.445
The keys are made from
the same stuff as demons?

42:54.613 --> 42:56.824
Now you get why they're so dangerous.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.079
What are you doing?

43:03.497 --> 43:04.957
There's one more thing

43:06.166 --> 43:07.876
that Chamberlin said we needed.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.929
That old man…

44:02.264 --> 44:03.849
…lied to me!

44:18.947 --> 44:23.077
Rendell tried,
but he couldn't make the magic work.

44:23.952 --> 44:25.954
So… So then, who made the key?

44:30.167 --> 44:31.126
Duncan.

44:35.631 --> 44:37.091
And then afterwards,

44:38.300 --> 44:40.678
we took away all of his memories of magic.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.726
I know what it's like
to be robbed of time.

44:55.818 --> 44:58.487
I can't live
knowing I've done that to Duncan.

45:04.368 --> 45:08.205
If we put the memories back, that means
he's gonna remember Dad killing Lucas.

45:08.288 --> 45:09.915
Look, I have to fix this.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.459
I owe him this.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.506
Maybe Tyler and I should do it.

45:25.514 --> 45:26.432
Yeah?

45:28.726 --> 45:29.560
Hey.

45:30.102 --> 45:31.353
Hey, Uncle Duncan.

45:34.857 --> 45:35.941
What's going on?

45:42.489 --> 45:43.449
Can you trust us?

45:44.825 --> 45:45.701
Sure.

45:47.035 --> 45:48.328
You guys are family.

46:10.309 --> 46:11.518
Wha…

46:13.562 --> 46:14.813
What is this?

46:18.734 --> 46:20.027
It's gonna be okay.
