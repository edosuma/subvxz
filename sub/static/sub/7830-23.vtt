00:09.300 --> 00:10.427
D'oh!

00:10.510 --> 00:11.761
-Ahh!
-(tires screeching)

00:26.860 --> 00:29.404
...which, if true
means death for us all.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.072
And now, Kent's people.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.409
Tonight's inspiring story
is about Frank Grimes,

00:34.492 --> 00:36.244
a 35-year-old
Springfieldite

00:36.327 --> 00:38.455
who's earned everything
the hard way

00:38.538 --> 00:41.583
but never let adversity
get him down.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.626
<i>Abandoned by his parents</i>
<i>at age four,</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:45.879
<i>Frank never got to go</i>
<i>to school.</i>

00:45.962 --> 00:48.882
<i>He spent his childhood years</i>
<i>as a delivery boy</i>

00:48.965 --> 00:52.635
<i>delivering toys</i>
<i>to more fortunate children.</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:55.180
<i>Then, on his 18th birthday</i>

00:55.263 --> 00:57.682
<i>he was blown up</i>
<i>in a silo explosion.</i>

00:59.684 --> 01:01.311
<i>During his long recuperation</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:04.147
<i>he taught himself to hear</i>
<i>and feel pain again.</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:05.732
<i>As the years passed</i>

01:05.815 --> 01:07.442
<i>he used his few</i>
<i>leisure moments each day</i>

01:07.525 --> 01:09.027
<i>to study science by mail.</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:11.821
<i>And last week</i>
<i>Frank Grimes--</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:15.241
<i>the man who had to struggle</i>
<i>for everything he ever got--</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:17.994
<i>received his correspondence</i>
<i>school diploma</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:19.412
<i>in nuclear physics...</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:22.582
<i>with a minor</i>
<i>in determination.</i>

01:22.665 --> 01:23.792
(screeching)

01:27.170 --> 01:30.381
That's the kind of man I need
on my team, Smithers.

01:30.465 --> 01:34.010
A real scrapper--
a self-made man like me.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.179
Bring this
Grimes fellow to me.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.390
I want to make him
my executive vice president.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.391
Yes, sir.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.271
Smithers,
I've just seen

01:45.355 --> 01:47.190
the most heroic dog
on television.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.110
He pulled a toddler from
the path of a speeding car

01:50.193 --> 01:51.694
then pushed a criminal
in front of it.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.071
Find this dog.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.865
I want to make him
my executive vice president.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.575
Uh, yes, sir.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.160
I-In the meantime,
here's Frank Grimes.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.083
The-- The self-made man?

02:05.166 --> 02:07.627
What? Oh, yes, that fellow.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.254
Oh, just put him somewhere
out of the way

02:09.337 --> 02:10.839
and find that dog!

02:10.922 --> 02:12.549
Yes, sir.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.925
Ahh.

02:14.008 --> 02:17.554
Chair goes round,
chair goes round...

02:17.637 --> 02:19.013
Hey, Homey,
you busy?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.473
Yes.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.100
Hey, there's a new guy
at the plant.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.810
Maybe we ought to say
"hi" to him.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.395
I don't know.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.021
I'm kind of dizzy.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.815
I should probably go home sick.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.443
Hm. Hmm.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.444
Mm-hm.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.447
Hm.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.574
(scrunching)

02:40.618 --> 02:41.870
You new?

02:41.953 --> 02:44.706
Yes. My name is Frank Grimes.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.124
I'm Lenny.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.750
This is Carl and Homer.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.586
-I'm Lenny.
-How do you do?

02:49.669 --> 02:52.338
Wow. You got pencils
with your name on 'em

02:52.422 --> 02:55.008
just like a pencil
company executive.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.051
I'd give anything
for one of these.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.762
Any office supply company
can have them made up for you.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.514
-Can I have this one?
-No.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.184
-Can Lenny have it?
-No.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.811
Oh, that's my degree
in nuclear physics.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.354
I'm sure you all have one.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.982
Oh, yeah. Carl and I
each have a master's.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.026
'Course old Homer,
he didn't need a degree.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.612
He showed up the day
they opened the plant.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.114
I didn't even know what
a nuclear panner plant was.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.157
Um...

03:19.240 --> 03:20.366
(chuckles)

03:20.450 --> 03:22.202
Yeah. Well, listen,

03:22.285 --> 03:24.746
I'm sure we all have
a lot of work to do.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.039
BOTH: Hm.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.753
Hey, you seem like a great guy,
so I'll give you a little tip:

03:31.836 --> 03:33.671
If you turn that
security camera around,

03:33.755 --> 03:37.217
you can sleep,
and no one will ever know.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.552
Uh, I don't think
we're being paid to sleep.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.055
Oh, yeah, they're always
trying to screw ya.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.806
Huh.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.810
"Marge" is already taken?

03:47.894 --> 03:48.978
Mm, how about "Marjorie?"

03:49.062 --> 03:50.188
(keyboard rattling)

03:50.271 --> 03:54.025
-Oh, sorry, ma'am.
-Mm...

03:54.108 --> 03:55.568
How about... "Mitzi?"

03:55.652 --> 03:56.819
(keyboard rattling)

03:56.903 --> 04:00.073
Uh-uh.
Uh, you can have "Nitzi."

04:00.156 --> 04:01.407
Hmm... "Nitzi..."

04:01.491 --> 04:02.492
I'm outta here.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.038
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
our next lot is number 751.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.165
How much am I bid
for item 751?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.667
Seven-five-one?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.796
Nothing.
No bids for item 751?

04:14.879 --> 04:15.964
A buck!

04:16.047 --> 04:16.965
I have a buck.
I have one dollar...

04:17.048 --> 04:18.633
(extended auctioneer patter)

04:26.307 --> 04:28.184
Sold! For a buck.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.769
Cool. What'd I buy?

04:29.852 --> 04:31.354
35 Industry Way.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.570
Looks like my
years of hard work

04:39.654 --> 04:40.989
have finally paid off.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.950
(Homer gulping)

04:44.033 --> 04:45.743
Hiya, Stretch,
what's the good word?

04:45.827 --> 04:47.787
My name is Grimes,
uh, Simpson.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.415
Frank Grimes. I took the trouble
to learn your name.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.208
The least you can do is...
learn mine.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.378
(chuckling)
Okay, Grimy.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.214
Uh, you're eating
my special dietetic lunch.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.300
Huh?

05:00.383 --> 05:02.010
(chuckling)
Oh, gee...

05:02.093 --> 05:03.052
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.762
The bag was clearly marked.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.180
Please be more careful
in the future.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.557
Check.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.058
(gulps)

05:12.979 --> 05:14.230
(humming)

05:15.773 --> 05:16.691
Mmm

05:18.735 --> 05:19.902
Ugh...

05:23.197 --> 05:24.824
Simpson, do you know
who chewed my--

05:28.953 --> 05:29.871
(snaps)

05:33.124 --> 05:34.250
Wow.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.419
It's filthy, and it's mine.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.298
(laughs)

05:43.676 --> 05:45.136
(clanks)

05:52.226 --> 05:53.311
-(hissing)
-Whee!

05:53.394 --> 05:54.729
(squeaking)

05:54.812 --> 05:55.730
(Bart groans)

05:57.440 --> 05:59.233
So, how's it going,
Grimy?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.610
I-I'd appreciate it

06:00.693 --> 06:02.528
if you'd stay out of
my office, Simpson.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.988
(laughs)

06:04.072 --> 06:06.199
I wish I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.117
(makes obnoxious sounds)

06:11.871 --> 06:15.583
<i>♪ Take me out</i>
<i>to the ball game ♪</i>

06:15.666 --> 06:20.630
<i>♪ Take me out</i>
<i>to the ball-ah... ♪</i>

06:20.713 --> 06:21.756
So... what's new, Grimy?

06:21.839 --> 06:22.840
(beeping)

06:22.924 --> 06:25.385
Simpson, you've got
a 5-13.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.844
No, a 5-13!

06:26.928 --> 06:29.138
In your procedures manual?
A 5-13?

06:32.016 --> 06:34.435
Look at your control panel.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.270
Oh!

06:36.354 --> 06:38.940
A 5-13.

06:39.023 --> 06:39.941
I'll handle it.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.442
(buzzing)

06:45.154 --> 06:46.072
That got it.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.083
(whistles)

06:57.166 --> 06:58.584
Hey, Milhouse!

06:58.668 --> 07:00.711
You want a job
in my factory?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.381
You don't have a factory.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.591
Hey, I'm a busy man.
You want a job or not?

07:05.675 --> 07:06.592
Okay.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.263
(crunching)

07:13.224 --> 07:15.143
God, he eats like a pig.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.603
I don't know.
Pigs tend to chew.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.313
I'd say he eats
more like a duck.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.734
Well, some kind
of farm animal, anyway.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.986
And earlier today

07:25.069 --> 07:27.655
I saw him asleep
inside a radiation suit.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.740
(chuckles)
Can you imagine that?

07:29.824 --> 07:31.284
He was hanging
from a coat hook!

07:31.367 --> 07:32.535
He had three beers
at lunch.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.120
That would make
anybody sleepy.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.913
I've never seen him do
any work around here.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.123
W-What is his job?

07:37.206 --> 07:38.207
Safety inspector.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.750
That irresponsible oaf?!

07:39.834 --> 07:41.169
A man who, by all rights

07:41.252 --> 07:43.171
should have been killed
dozens of times by now?

07:43.254 --> 07:46.090
Eh, 316 times,
by my count.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.759
That's the man who's in charge
of our safety?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.219
I-It boggles the mind.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.471
It's best
not to think about it.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.310
(grunts)

08:01.522 --> 08:03.024
You idiot!

08:03.107 --> 08:05.568
You nearly drank a beaker
full of sulfuric acid!

08:05.651 --> 08:08.321
Acid, eh? Gee, that
would have been stupid.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.405
(laughs)

08:09.489 --> 08:11.407
Boy, would my face
have been red.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.451
(laughing)

08:16.162 --> 08:18.623
Stop laughing,
you imbecile!

08:18.706 --> 08:20.208
Don't you realize
how close you just came

08:20.291 --> 08:21.209
to killing yourself?

08:25.713 --> 08:27.798
Who did this to my wall?

08:27.882 --> 08:28.883
He did.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.510
Is this true?

08:30.593 --> 08:33.679
I, well, uh, technically
it is true, sir, but--

08:33.763 --> 08:35.139
Come with me.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.436
He likes you.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.938
(barking)

08:42.021 --> 08:43.773
BURNS: How dare you destroy
my valuable wall

08:43.856 --> 08:45.358
and spill my priceless acid?!

08:45.441 --> 08:46.776
Did you think you were
going to get away with it?

08:46.859 --> 08:49.111
-GRIMES: I wasn't--
-BURNS: Silence!

08:49.195 --> 08:50.655
I'm going to give you
one more chance...

08:50.738 --> 08:52.615
at a reduced salary.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.408
So straighten up
and fly right.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.451
GRIMES: But, sir,
if I could--

08:55.535 --> 08:57.203
(barking and growling)

09:02.542 --> 09:03.876
Hi, Grimy, old buddy.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.461
I'm not your
buddy, Simpson!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.463
I don't like you.
In fact, I hate you.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.423
Stay the hell
away from me!

09:09.507 --> 09:12.677
Because from now on...
we're enemies!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.470
Okay.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.639
Do I have to do anything?

09:16.722 --> 09:18.391
(groans)

09:23.396 --> 09:25.940
Oh, I can't believe it.
I got an enemy.

09:26.023 --> 09:29.193
Me. The most beloved man
in Springfield.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.319
Ah, it's
a weird world, Homer.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.154
As hard as it is
to believe,

09:32.238 --> 09:33.990
some people don't care
for me neither.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.033
No, I won't
accept that.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.326
No, it's true.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.995
I got their names
written down right here

09:39.078 --> 09:41.789
in what I call
my, uh, enemies list.

09:41.872 --> 09:46.002
Jane Fonda, Daniel Shore,
Jack Anderson--

09:46.085 --> 09:49.213
Hey! This is Richard Nixon's
enemies list.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.966
You just crossed out his name
and put yours.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.510
Okay, give me that.
Give me it back.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.054
Barney Gumbel.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.180
Oh.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.640
Oh, what'll
I do, Moe?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.392
Well, why don't you
invite him over to dinner?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.561
Turn him from an enemy
into a friend.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.021
Then, when he's
not expecting it--

10:05.104 --> 10:07.940
Bam! The old fork
in the eye.

10:08.024 --> 10:08.983
Do you think
it might work

10:09.066 --> 10:11.694
without the fork
in the eye?

10:11.777 --> 10:12.695
There's always
a first time.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.869
This dinner has to go
absolutely perfect

10:19.952 --> 10:22.288
if Grimy and me are
going to be friends.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.873
Lisa, be perfect.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.000
-Okay.
-Marge, perfect.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.127
Bart, perfect.
Other kid, perfect.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.087
I only have five lobsters.
Are you sure

10:30.171 --> 10:31.839
he's not bringing
anyone with him?

10:31.922 --> 10:33.883
No, no. He doesn't know
he's coming to dinner.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.926
I didn't think he'd come,
so I called and said

10:36.010 --> 10:37.887
I have something
really important to tell him

10:37.970 --> 10:39.639
and that I could only
tell him about it here.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.849
-(doorbell rings)
-It's him!

10:41.932 --> 10:43.851
(singsongy) It's him!
It's him! It's him!

10:43.934 --> 10:45.895
Calm down.
Homer, calm down.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.271
Answer the door.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.814
(gasping)

10:51.567 --> 10:52.902
Welcome
to the Simpson residence

10:52.985 --> 10:54.236
or <i>casa de Simpson,</i>
as I call it.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.865
Yeah, what did you want
to see me about, Simpson?

10:57.948 --> 10:59.200
This better
be important.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.576
It is. It is.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.704
But first, let me
introduce you to my family.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.915
My perfect family.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.416
This is my
wife, Marge.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.542
Hello.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.628
HOMER:
And our beautiful baby.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.339
My daughter Lisa
I.Q.-156.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.382
Hi.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.342
HOMER: See, and
my son Bart.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.219
He owns
a factory downtown.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.179
How do you do?
Look, Homer, I'm late

11:20.262 --> 11:21.555
for my night job
at the foundry

11:21.639 --> 11:23.057
so if you don't
mind telling me...

11:24.809 --> 11:28.562
Good heavens!
This is a palace.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.272
How in the world
can you afford to live

11:30.356 --> 11:32.024
in a house like this, Simpson?

11:32.108 --> 11:34.443
I don't know. Don't ask me
how the economy works.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.071
Yeah, but look
at the size of this place.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.657
I live in a single room
above a bowling alley

11:39.740 --> 11:41.575
and below another
bowling alley.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.660
Wow.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.120
I'm sorry, isn't that--

11:44.203 --> 11:45.287
Yeah, that's me
all right.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.956
And the guy
standing next to me

11:47.039 --> 11:48.666
is president Gerald Ford.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.459
And this is
when I was on tour

11:50.543 --> 11:51.961
with the Smashing Pumpkins.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.547
Oh, and here's a picture of me
in outer space.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.716
You... went
into outer space?

11:56.799 --> 11:57.883
You?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.761
Sure.
You've never been?

12:00.845 --> 12:02.388
Would you like to see
my Grammy award?

12:02.471 --> 12:04.098
No! I wouldn't!

12:04.181 --> 12:06.934
God! I've had to work hard
every day of my life

12:07.017 --> 12:09.061
and what do I have
to show for it?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.772
This briefcase
and this haircut!

12:11.856 --> 12:13.149
And what do you have to show

12:13.232 --> 12:15.818
for your lifetime
of sloth and ignorance?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.946
-What?
-Everything!

12:19.029 --> 12:21.991
A dream house, two cars,
a beautiful wife,

12:22.074 --> 12:25.161
a son who owns a factory,
fancy clothes, and--

12:25.244 --> 12:26.287
(sniffing)

12:26.370 --> 12:27.955
Lobsters for dinner!

12:28.038 --> 12:29.999
And do you
deserve any of it?

12:30.082 --> 12:31.167
No!

12:31.250 --> 12:34.420
(gasps)
What are you saying?

12:34.503 --> 12:36.380
I'm saying,
you're what's wrong

12:36.464 --> 12:38.090
with America,
Simpson.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.425
You coast
through life.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.968
You do as little
as possible

12:41.051 --> 12:42.762
and you leach off decent

12:42.845 --> 12:45.347
hardworking people
like me.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.099
If you lived in any other
country in the world,

12:47.183 --> 12:49.059
you would have
starved to death long ago.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.020
He's got you there, Dad.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.313
You're a fraud.

12:52.396 --> 12:55.065
A total fraud.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.317
It was nice
meeting you.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.777
(door slams)

13:04.742 --> 13:08.329
MILHOUSE:
Wow... adding machines.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.581
Industrial waste.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.000
What should we do
with all this stuff, Bart?

13:13.083 --> 13:14.919
I think we both know
the answer to that.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.763
(sighs)

13:25.846 --> 13:26.972
(knocking)

13:27.056 --> 13:28.224
<i>Get to work.</i>

13:28.307 --> 13:30.392
(stairs squeaking)

13:30.476 --> 13:33.020
BOTH: Wacky shack!

13:33.103 --> 13:34.772
Better be
careful, Bart.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.732
Look at those
warning signs.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.278
Solve your problem,
Milhouse?

13:41.362 --> 13:42.822
Yup.

13:42.905 --> 13:43.906
(stairs squeaking)

13:50.412 --> 13:51.330
Hm?

13:52.915 --> 13:53.874
(knocking)

13:53.958 --> 13:55.042
Homer.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.044
Homer, why aren't
you at work?

13:57.127 --> 13:58.879
The car won't start.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.756
I don't feel
very good today.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.799
I am at work.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.259
You're afraid to go to work

14:03.342 --> 14:05.427
because Frank Grimes
will be there, aren't you?

14:05.511 --> 14:08.138
That's crazy talk.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.307
You're crazy, Marge.
Get off the road.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.476
(honks horn)

14:12.560 --> 14:14.436
You'll have
to face him sometime,

14:14.520 --> 14:16.313
and when you do,
I'm sure he'll be

14:16.397 --> 14:18.274
just as anxious
to make up as you are.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.317
No, he won't.
He hates me.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.902
He doesn't hate you.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.362
He just feels insecure

14:23.445 --> 14:25.489
because you're getting
through life so easily,

14:25.573 --> 14:28.158
and it's been
so difficult for him.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.369
Yeah. Yeah.
That's his problem.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.662
He's a nut.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.331
It's not about me being lazy.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.792
It's about him
being a crazy nut.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.503
Well... maybe.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.505
But I'll bet
he would be less crazy

14:41.589 --> 14:43.132
if you were just
a little more,

14:43.215 --> 14:45.301
mm...
professional in your work.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.427
(gasps)

14:46.510 --> 14:48.387
Just a little more.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.390
Then he won't have any reason
to resent you.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.309
I'll do it.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.310
To professionalism.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.196
Good morning, fellow employee.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.158
You'll notice that I am now
a model worker.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.327
We should continue
this conversation later

15:11.410 --> 15:13.495
during a designated
break period.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.623
Sincerely,
Homer Simpson.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.583
(beeping)

15:19.752 --> 15:21.879
Can you believe that guy?

15:21.962 --> 15:23.088
He's in his office
making a pathetic attempt

15:23.172 --> 15:24.548
to look professional.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.966
Hey, what do you got
against Homer anyway?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.551
Are you kidding?

15:27.635 --> 15:29.428
Does this whole plant
have some disease

15:29.511 --> 15:31.096
where it can't see
that he's an idiot?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.348
Look here.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.183
Accidents have doubled
every year

15:34.266 --> 15:36.018
since he became
safety inspector.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.353
And meltdowns have tripled.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.146
Has he been fired? No.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.606
Has he been disciplined?
No, no.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.733
Ah, everybody
makes mistakes.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.610
That's why they put
erasers on pencils.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.612
Yeah, Homer's okay.
Give him a break.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.822
No. Homer is not okay.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.991
And I want everyone in this
plant to realize it.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.160
I would die a happy man
if I could prove to you

15:53.243 --> 15:54.620
that Homer Simpson
has the intelligence

15:54.703 --> 15:55.746
of a six year old.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.917
So, how you doing?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.335
(groans)

16:03.128 --> 16:04.755
Hmm?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.716
Uh, here we go.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.146
Mm-hm.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.816
Ahh.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.402
Design your own
power plant, eh?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.445
This is my chance
to show everyone

16:28.529 --> 16:30.197
how professional I am.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.116
Lenny, tell Mr. Burns
I've gone home

16:32.199 --> 16:34.576
to work on the contest.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.578
(chuckling)

16:43.127 --> 16:44.962
Oh, God!

16:48.173 --> 16:49.633
(power tool grinding)

16:49.717 --> 16:51.552
(Homer shouting, indistinct)

16:54.972 --> 16:56.557
Ow!
(shouting)

16:58.559 --> 17:01.270
Can I go downstairs
and see what Dad's doing?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.188
I wouldn't
bother him, honey.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.607
He's making some kind
of model for a contest.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.568
He says it's really
high-tech stuff

17:07.651 --> 17:09.653
that we wouldn't
understand.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.697
Marge, do we have
any elbow macaroni

17:11.780 --> 17:13.198
and glue-on sparkles?

17:13.282 --> 17:14.742
-(banging)
-(grunting)

17:19.997 --> 17:21.165
(whistle blowing)

17:21.248 --> 17:23.584
Oh, boy! Quittin' time!

17:27.671 --> 17:28.881
Just a minute, Van Houten.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.924
Somebody needs to guard
this place tonight

17:31.008 --> 17:32.509
so it doesn't get trashed.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.386
How'd you like to be
night watchman?

17:34.470 --> 17:35.846
But I'm sleepy.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.806
Oh, no <i>problemo.</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:38.974
Here's a nickel
for the coffee machine.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.356
(squeaking)

17:52.821 --> 17:54.615
So this is my life.

17:54.698 --> 17:57.451
At least I've done
better than Dad.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.746
(whistling, gasps)

18:00.829 --> 18:03.123
Aw, geez!

18:03.207 --> 18:04.833
Milhouse, how could you
let this happen?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.960
You were supposed to be
the night watchman.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.087
I was watching.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.922
I saw the whole thing.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.091
First, it started
falling over,

18:12.174 --> 18:13.467
and then it fell over.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.968
Wow.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.971
I wonder where all the rats
are gonna go.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.807
(rats squeaking)

18:23.310 --> 18:24.478
MOE: Okay, everybody,

18:24.561 --> 18:26.230
tuck your pants
into your socks.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.484
And the bold new ideas

18:30.567 --> 18:33.112
these tiny tykes
unveil for us today

18:33.195 --> 18:37.241
could make thousands of jobs
like yours obsolete!

18:37.324 --> 18:38.826
(scant applause)

18:40.369 --> 18:42.955
Our first little genius
is Ralph Wiggum.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.751
It's pretty
good, sir.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.547
Hot tub?
Media room?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.298
It's supposed to be
a power plant

18:53.382 --> 18:55.509
not Aunt Beulah's bordello.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.344
Thank you.
Get out.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.888
Next.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.849
WIGGUM: Uh, Ralphy,
get off the stage, sweetheart.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.605
Behold!

19:08.689 --> 19:12.985
The power plant
of the future... today!

19:13.068 --> 19:14.361
(moans)

19:14.444 --> 19:15.946
Too cold and sterile.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.157
Where's the heart?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.117
But it really
generates power.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.244
It's lighting this room
right now.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.374
You lose. Get off
my property.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.584
Let's have the next child.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.129
Look, everybody!

19:32.212 --> 19:33.839
Simpson's in a contest
with children!

19:33.922 --> 19:35.215
Hey, shh!

19:35.299 --> 19:36.758
You're making us
miss the contest.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.305
Could you explain
your model, young man?

19:41.388 --> 19:42.556
What's to explain?!

19:42.639 --> 19:43.599
He's an idiot?!

19:43.682 --> 19:45.517
LENNY: Pipe down!

19:45.601 --> 19:48.729
Well, basically,
I just copied the plant we have now.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.189
Mm...

19:50.272 --> 19:53.400
Then, I added some fins
to lower wind resistance.

19:53.483 --> 19:56.361
And this racing stripe here
I feel is pretty sharp.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.697
Agreed.
First prize.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.699
-What?!
-Way to go, Homer!

20:00.782 --> 20:02.367
You're number one, Homer!

20:02.451 --> 20:04.995
But it was a contest
for children!

20:05.078 --> 20:07.164
Yeah, and Homer beat
their brains out!

20:07.247 --> 20:08.832
(cheering)

20:08.916 --> 20:11.126
CROWD: Yeah! Yeah!

20:11.210 --> 20:13.837
I can't stand it any longer.
This whole plant is insane!

20:13.921 --> 20:15.547
Insane, I tell you!

20:15.631 --> 20:18.258
(screams)

20:20.719 --> 20:21.678
I can be lazy, too!

20:21.762 --> 20:23.430
Look at me!

20:23.513 --> 20:26.850
Hi! I'm a worthless employee
just like Homer Simpson!

20:26.934 --> 20:28.185
Give me a promotion!

20:31.063 --> 20:33.857
Ooh, I eat like a slob,
but nobody minds!

20:33.941 --> 20:35.192
(gobbling loudly)

20:38.445 --> 20:39.780
I'm peeing
on the seat!

20:39.863 --> 20:42.199
Give me a raise!

20:42.282 --> 20:44.952
Now I'm returning to work
without washing my hands!

20:45.035 --> 20:46.245
But it doesn't matter

20:46.328 --> 20:48.747
because
I'm Homer Simpson.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.666
I don't need to do my work

20:50.749 --> 20:52.834
'cause someone else
will do it for me.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.461
D-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh!

20:54.544 --> 20:55.963
Hey, you okay, Grimy?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.422
I'm better than okay.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.548
I'm Homer Simpson.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.425
You wish.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.802
Oh, hi, Mr. Burns.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.221
I'm the worst worker
in the world.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.847
Time to go home
to my mansion

21:05.931 --> 21:07.557
and eat my lobster.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.435
What's this?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.229
"Extremely high voltage."

21:12.312 --> 21:14.564
Well, I don't need
safety gloves

21:14.648 --> 21:16.108
because I'm Homer Simp--

21:16.191 --> 21:17.317
(zapping)

21:20.946 --> 21:22.406
LOVEJOY:
Frank Grimes,

21:22.489 --> 21:25.617
or "Grimy,"
as he liked to be called,

21:25.701 --> 21:29.788
taught us that a man
can triumph over adversity.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.456
And even though Frank's

21:31.540 --> 21:33.292
agonizing struggle
through life

21:33.375 --> 21:36.003
was tragically
cut short...

21:36.086 --> 21:37.713
I'm sure he's...

21:37.796 --> 21:41.633
(snoring)

21:41.717 --> 21:43.760
Change the channel, Marge.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.846
(laughing)

21:45.929 --> 21:46.888
That's our Homer!

21:46.972 --> 21:48.473
(laughing)

22:39.524 --> 22:40.442
Shhh!!
