Damn it. Ugh. Okay, look,

05:30.129 --> 05:33.259
I just need you guys to help me

05:33.279 --> 05:36.079
go through these boxes

05:33.279 --> 05:36.079
of my old college stuff.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.040
David gave me

05:36.100 --> 05:38.040
this special necklace,

05:38.060 --> 05:39.279
and I have no idea what it

05:38.060 --> 05:39.279
looks like, so I can't find it.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.220
I need clues. Go.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.220
Go, go, go.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.180
- Let's see what's in

05:41.240 --> 05:43.180
this sad-ass box of memories.

05:43.199 --> 05:46.079
Number one--

05:43.199 --> 05:46.079
we got art-class sketches.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.060
- Oh, no, no, no.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.060
Put that down.

05:48.079 --> 05:49.269
That's probably the one thing

05:48.079 --> 05:49.269
in the box I do care about.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.240
- Oh, you don't care about

05:49.290 --> 05:51.240
this guy in a porkpie hat

05:51.259 --> 05:53.159
playing the clarinet?

05:53.180 --> 05:55.180
- Oh, I do,

05:53.180 --> 05:55.180
'cause I married him.

05:55.199 --> 05:57.220
That is David

05:55.199 --> 05:57.220
and his college swing band,

05:57.240 --> 05:59.240
"Big Papa D and the Jinx."

05:59.259 --> 06:04.050
- Wow. So, tell me, was it his

05:59.259 --> 06:04.050
ponytail or his chain wallet

06:04.069 --> 06:06.240
that made you think,

06:04.069 --> 06:06.240
"Ooh, husband material"?

06:06.259 --> 06:08.240
- What do you know, Chewey?

06:06.259 --> 06:08.240
You're alone.

06:08.259 --> 06:10.269
- Checkmate.

06:08.259 --> 06:10.269
- Oh, boy. Jackpot.

06:10.290 --> 06:12.129
- What, what?

06:10.290 --> 06:12.129
Did you find a clue?

06:12.149 --> 06:14.240
- I found what appears

06:12.149 --> 06:14.240
to be 75 pages

06:14.259 --> 06:18.120
of "Bloodlust: A Zuzhana

06:14.259 --> 06:18.120
St. DuBois Story."

06:18.139 --> 06:20.240
Were you trying to write

06:18.139 --> 06:20.240
a trashy vampire novel?

06:20.259 --> 06:22.129
- No, that was for English lit.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.079
"As he penetrated

06:22.149 --> 06:24.079
her pulsating jugular,

06:24.100 --> 06:26.189
she thought, if this

06:24.100 --> 06:26.189
is how the night would be,

06:26.209 --> 06:28.180
she no longer needed daylight."

06:28.199 --> 06:30.120
- It's a political

06:28.199 --> 06:30.120
metaphor, so--

06:30.139 --> 06:31.290
- "Unsheathing his immortal

06:30.139 --> 06:31.290
manhood, she whispered,

06:32.009 --> 06:34.269
'This has nothing to do

06:32.009 --> 06:34.269
with politics. Take me.'"

06:34.290 --> 06:37.100
- Part of the metaphor.

06:34.290 --> 06:37.100
- Hey, here's a picture of you

06:37.120 --> 06:39.110
wearing a necklace.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.110
- What? Let me see.

06:39.129 --> 06:41.079
[gasps] Oh, my God.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.060
That's the necklace.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.060
I remember it now.

06:43.079 --> 06:45.209
Oh, my God. David had it made

06:43.079 --> 06:45.209
for me from a pebble

06:45.230 --> 06:47.149
that he found on the beach.

06:47.170 --> 06:50.090
I had no idea this necklace

06:47.170 --> 06:50.090
was so special to him.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.230
Oh, God, I'm a monster.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.230
I got to do the right thing.

06:53.250 --> 06:56.060
Have a fake necklace made

06:53.250 --> 06:56.060
and lie, lie, lie.

06:56.079 --> 06:57.090
- Yeah.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.160
- Oh, we got next. Let's go.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.160
- Let's go.

07:00.180 --> 07:02.100
- Hey, hold up, one second.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.199
Just--uh, I need a real quick

07:02.120 --> 07:03.199
emotional check-in.

07:03.220 --> 07:06.079
- Oh, no. Hey, fellas,

07:03.220 --> 07:06.079
give us a second.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.199
- Do you guys ever look over at

07:06.100 --> 07:08.199
the person sleeping next to you

07:08.220 --> 07:10.250
and just think,

07:08.220 --> 07:10.250
"Who is this stranger?"

07:10.269 --> 07:12.259
- Sure, I love sleeping

07:10.269 --> 07:12.259
with strangers.

07:12.279 --> 07:14.209
That's why I got divorced.

07:12.279 --> 07:14.209
[chuckles]

07:14.230 --> 07:16.160
What's going on, man?

07:16.180 --> 07:19.000
- Sometimes I just think me

07:16.180 --> 07:19.000
and Emet are so different.

07:19.019 --> 07:20.259
- You know what they say--

07:19.019 --> 07:20.259
"Men are from Mars,"

07:20.279 --> 07:22.110
and...let's play.

07:22.129 --> 07:24.000
- Wait, hold on.

07:22.129 --> 07:24.000
I made her a necklace

07:24.019 --> 07:26.069
out of a stone I found to

07:24.019 --> 07:26.069
commemorate our beach-aversary.

07:26.089 --> 07:27.250
- Wait, wait, wait.

07:26.089 --> 07:27.250
Hold. Hold a second.

07:27.269 --> 07:30.170
You celebrate

07:27.269 --> 07:30.170
your beach-aversary?

07:30.189 --> 07:32.000
- Yeah.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.189
- Come on, that's the most

07:32.019 --> 07:34.189
[bleep] romantic thing

07:34.209 --> 07:36.100
I ever heard in my life.

07:34.209 --> 07:36.100
- Right? Okay.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.199
That is the first big present

07:36.120 --> 07:37.199
I ever got her,

07:37.220 --> 07:39.009
and I don't even know

07:37.220 --> 07:39.009
if she likes it.

07:39.029 --> 07:40.259
I mean, she never wears

07:39.029 --> 07:40.259
the thing.

07:40.279 --> 07:42.209
- Bro, hard truth time--

07:40.279 --> 07:42.209
that thing is lost.

07:42.230 --> 07:44.250
Gone forever. It's with Biggie

07:42.230 --> 07:44.250
and 'Pac now, right?

07:44.269 --> 07:46.259
- Mm-hmm. Talking about losing,

07:44.269 --> 07:46.259
we're about to lose this court.

07:46.279 --> 07:48.230
Can we play?

07:46.279 --> 07:48.230
- Dave, this may not

07:48.250 --> 07:50.230
be my place just as

07:48.250 --> 07:50.230
your basketball friend,

07:50.250 --> 07:53.269
but you wife undervalues you

07:50.250 --> 07:53.269
as a husband and a man.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.159
- Right. Thank you.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.100
'Cause that is

07:55.180 --> 07:57.100
how it is feeling right now.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.220
I mean, if she had given me

07:57.120 --> 07:58.220
that necklace,

07:58.240 --> 08:00.230
I would know exactly

07:58.240 --> 08:00.230
where it is at all times.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.110
It's either around my neck,

08:02.129 --> 08:03.220
or it's in my locker

08:02.129 --> 08:03.220
'cause I'm getting

08:03.240 --> 08:04.279
a combination Thai,

08:03.240 --> 08:04.279
hot-stone massage.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.120
- This thing isn't about

08:05.000 --> 08:06.120
the necklace.

08:06.139 --> 08:07.269
It's about the fear

08:06.139 --> 08:07.269
that you love her

08:07.290 --> 08:09.129
more than she loves you.

08:09.149 --> 08:11.129
- Or it can be

08:09.149 --> 08:11.129
in a drawer somewhere.

08:11.149 --> 08:13.100
Can we play?

08:11.149 --> 08:13.100
- No, no. He's right.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.250
I've been taking it way

08:13.120 --> 08:14.250
too easy on her.

08:14.269 --> 08:16.170
I got to call her bluff.

08:14.269 --> 08:16.170
- Do it.

08:16.189 --> 08:18.259
- Good talk. Thank you.

08:16.189 --> 08:18.259
- Man up, baby.

08:22.279 --> 08:24.180
- Who cares?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.230
- I found Mom's old journals.

08:26.250 --> 08:29.180
We can use them to do a play

08:26.250 --> 08:29.180
at the anniversary party--

08:29.199 --> 08:32.019
"Mom and Dad, A Love Story."

08:32.039 --> 08:35.179
- That is much better than

08:32.039 --> 08:35.179
the card I've been working on.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.210
Yeah, I always forget--

08:35.200 --> 08:39.210
it's cut, then paste.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.220
- I'll get started

08:39.230 --> 08:41.220
on the script.

08:42.279 --> 08:46.210
- Guess what I did.

08:42.279 --> 08:46.210
I had an exact replica made

08:46.230 --> 08:48.269
of the necklace

08:46.230 --> 08:48.269
David gave me and a backup

08:48.289 --> 08:51.190
in case future me

08:48.289 --> 08:51.190
forgets it existed.

08:51.210 --> 08:55.139
So crisis averted, marriage

08:51.210 --> 08:55.139
saved, cookie sleeve opened.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.190
- Your marriage

08:55.159 --> 08:57.190
is built on lies.

08:57.210 --> 09:01.120
But don't worry.

08:57.210 --> 09:01.120
Oh, they're big, strong lies.

09:01.139 --> 09:03.139
- Hey.

09:03.159 --> 09:04.240
How was basketball?

09:04.259 --> 09:06.230
- Kind of intense today.

09:04.259 --> 09:06.230
- Mmm...

09:06.250 --> 09:09.100
- I'm just feeling so romantic

09:06.250 --> 09:09.100
with our anniversary coming up,

09:09.120 --> 09:10.179
and I think that maybe

09:10.200 --> 09:12.190
you should put on

09:10.200 --> 09:12.190
our special necklace

09:12.210 --> 09:15.179
and I should draw you

09:12.210 --> 09:15.179
Titanic-style.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.029
[refrigerator door closes]

09:15.200 --> 09:17.029
- Oh!

09:17.049 --> 09:18.289
- It's a sinking ship.

09:19.009 --> 09:20.240
- Did not see her there.

09:19.009 --> 09:20.240
- Yeah, sorry about that.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.129
- You could've--

09:22.149 --> 09:24.149
- Anyway, hey, uh, baby,

09:22.149 --> 09:24.149
that sounds so hot, but...

09:24.169 --> 09:26.139
[clears throat] I'm having

09:24.169 --> 09:26.139
the necklace cleaned.

09:26.159 --> 09:27.250
- Hmm.

09:27.269 --> 09:29.289
- So you're just going

09:27.269 --> 09:29.289
to have to draw me naked.

09:30.009 --> 09:31.200
- Mmm...

09:30.009 --> 09:31.200
- Okay?

09:31.220 --> 09:33.039
- No, I think I'll wait.

09:31.220 --> 09:33.039
- What?

09:33.059 --> 09:34.230
- Yeah, but that cleaning is

09:33.059 --> 09:34.230
really going to make

09:34.250 --> 09:36.240
that line of gold pop.

09:36.259 --> 09:40.129
- What? There wasn't a line of

09:36.259 --> 09:40.129
gold in that stupid picture.

09:40.149 --> 09:42.230
Ah, must've been on the other

09:40.149 --> 09:42.230
side of the damn pebble.

09:42.250 --> 09:46.000
Oh, yes,

09:42.250 --> 09:46.000
I love that line of gold.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.230
Oh, it looks just like...

09:48.250 --> 09:50.200
Jesus.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.200
- A heart.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.049
It looks just like a heart.

09:52.070 --> 09:53.200
You remember the--

09:52.070 --> 09:53.200
- You didn't let me finish.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.000
- All right.

09:55.019 --> 09:56.190
- I was saying, "Jesus,

09:55.019 --> 09:56.190
I love that heart."

09:56.210 --> 09:58.240
- It is one in a million--

09:56.210 --> 09:58.240
nay, a billion--

09:58.259 --> 10:00.240
and I cannot wait

09:58.259 --> 10:00.240
to see you in it again.

10:00.259 --> 10:03.120
[smooches]

10:03.139 --> 10:04.259
[swing music playing

10:03.139 --> 10:04.259
through headphones]

10:04.279 --> 10:07.059
- Wow, Big Papa D and the Jinx.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.259
I assume the Jinx is for the

10:07.080 --> 10:10.259
the bad luck of the listener.

10:10.279 --> 10:12.139
Oh, come on!

10:12.159 --> 10:15.120
I was listening

10:12.159 --> 10:15.120
to "Blow, Man, Blow."

10:15.139 --> 10:16.250
- It sucks, man, sucks.

10:16.269 --> 10:18.019
- You guys, this is hopeless.

10:18.039 --> 10:19.259
How am I supposed

10:18.039 --> 10:19.259
to find a rock

10:19.279 --> 10:22.000
with a heart-shaped line

10:19.279 --> 10:22.000
on it?

10:22.019 --> 10:24.159
Damn it, I wish I was as

10:22.019 --> 10:24.159
sentimental as David is.

10:24.179 --> 10:26.019
Then I'd know exactly

10:24.179 --> 10:26.019
where this necklace is.

10:26.039 --> 10:27.259
- Wow, Big Papa D

10:26.039 --> 10:27.259
and the Jinx!

10:27.279 --> 10:29.169
- Okay, lay off, Griff.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.279
- No, no, look,

10:29.190 --> 10:31.279
check it out--for real.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.070
- Oh, my God. Oh, that's right.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.230
I gave a big box of stuff

10:34.250 --> 10:36.210
to Gladys

10:34.250 --> 10:36.210
for her church yard sale.

10:36.230 --> 10:38.269
[gasps] Maybe she knows who

10:36.230 --> 10:38.269
bought the necklace.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.169
Oh, yes.

10:40.190 --> 10:41.269
Hey, Gladys, hey.

10:41.289 --> 10:43.179
Um, do you remember

10:41.289 --> 10:43.179
that box of stuff

10:43.200 --> 10:44.279
I gave you a few months back?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.269
Did you happen to find

10:45.000 --> 10:46.269
a necklace in it?

10:46.289 --> 10:49.169
Do you mean this one?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.259
- Yes! Okay, so, funny story--

10:51.279 --> 10:54.000
- You know, this necklace is

10:51.279 --> 10:54.000
my good-luck charm.

10:54.019 --> 10:55.169
- Oh, that's sweet.

10:55.190 --> 10:57.169
- Last year, I was diagnosed

10:55.190 --> 10:57.169
with the Big C.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.000
- Oh, God.

10:59.019 --> 11:00.269
- Then I got this,

10:59.019 --> 11:00.269
and it turned around.

11:00.289 --> 11:03.269
Oh, but I'm sorry.

11:00.289 --> 11:03.269
What was your funny story?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.059
I could use a laugh these days.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.230
- Ah, you know what?

11:08.250 --> 11:12.029
Never mind. [chuckles]

11:08.250 --> 11:12.029
Not that funny after all.

11:12.049 --> 11:16.049
Gladys has the Big C?

11:12.049 --> 11:16.049
Ugh, can I ever catch a break?

11:21.049 --> 11:21.070
.

11:23.039 --> 11:25.110
- Feels like hoop o'clock

11:23.190 --> 11:25.110
to me.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.279
- Oh, hey, guys!

11:26.019 --> 11:27.279
- Emet, wow!

11:28.000 --> 11:30.019
You look beautiful, sweetheart.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.019
Come here.

11:30.039 --> 11:31.279
Molto bene.

11:30.039 --> 11:31.279
- Oh.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.259
- Beautiful. Let's go.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.259
- Yeah.

11:33.279 --> 11:35.169
Um, hey, sweetie,

11:33.279 --> 11:35.169
did the necklace come back?

11:35.190 --> 11:37.019
I really wanted to show

11:35.190 --> 11:37.019
the guys.

11:37.039 --> 11:39.179
- Oh, uh, sorry.

11:37.039 --> 11:39.179
It's still bring cleaned.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.279
- Cleaned--uh, how kind.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.279
- Wow.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.250
- Make it sparkle, sweetheart.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.220
- I will. [chuckles]

11:43.269 --> 11:46.220
Okay, see you guys later.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.149

11:46.240 --> 11:49.149
are in the house.

11:49.169 --> 11:50.269
She's a sociopath.

11:50.289 --> 11:52.230
- Hey, we could work

11:50.289 --> 11:52.230
this out on the court.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.169
- You know what, man? I don't

11:52.250 --> 11:54.169
even want to play anymore.

11:54.190 --> 11:56.019
- Oh...

11:54.190 --> 11:56.019
- How about a milkshake?

11:56.039 --> 11:59.279
- That would be really helpful.

11:56.039 --> 11:59.279
Thanks. Okay.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.289
- Milkshakes.

12:02.009 --> 12:03.190
Anybody?

12:03.210 --> 12:04.240
Nope.

12:04.259 --> 12:07.289
[dramatic electronic music]

12:08.009 --> 12:09.200
- Hey, Mom.

12:08.009 --> 12:09.200
- Hold on.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.039
I'm just about to learn

12:11.059 --> 12:13.250
Patricia Clarkson's number-one

12:11.059 --> 12:13.250
antiaging secret.

12:13.269 --> 12:16.149
Oh. It's "living

12:13.269 --> 12:16.149
in the moment."

12:16.169 --> 12:18.049
What's up?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.049
- Okay, so...

12:18.070 --> 12:20.029
you know how I tend to not

12:18.070 --> 12:20.029
acknowledge sentimental things

12:20.049 --> 12:21.210
because I'm your daughter and

12:20.049 --> 12:21.210
we share the same black heart?

12:21.230 --> 12:23.159
- Go on.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.159
- Well, you're right.

12:23.179 --> 12:25.250
I am screwed because I don't

12:23.179 --> 12:25.250
have that necklace after all.

12:25.269 --> 12:27.200
- Oh, Emet.

12:25.269 --> 12:27.200
- [sighs]

12:27.220 --> 12:30.039
- I'm concerned,

12:27.220 --> 12:30.039
deeply concerned.

12:30.059 --> 12:32.200
- Thank you.

12:30.059 --> 12:32.200
- Not for you, for me.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.149
- Okay.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.149
- You can't ruin your marriage.

12:34.169 --> 12:36.289
I'm too old to start again

12:34.169 --> 12:36.289
with another son-in-law.

12:37.009 --> 12:39.049
I'm used to this bozo now.

12:39.070 --> 12:41.200
- The worst part is I know

12:39.070 --> 12:41.200
exactly where it is,

12:41.220 --> 12:43.029
but I can't get it back.

12:43.049 --> 12:44.250
- Nonsense,

12:43.049 --> 12:44.250
there's always a way.

12:44.269 --> 12:47.240
- No, there isn't--

12:44.269 --> 12:47.240
I gave it to Gladys at work,

12:47.259 --> 12:50.159
and it's the only thing that

12:47.259 --> 12:50.159
got her through the Big C.

12:50.179 --> 12:52.259
Not a person in the world who's

12:50.179 --> 12:52.259
cold enough to take it back

12:52.279 --> 12:54.139
from her after that.

12:54.159 --> 12:57.169
- That's what you think.

12:54.159 --> 12:57.169
- Go on.

12:57.190 --> 13:00.210
[upbeat music]

13:00.230 --> 13:03.240
- Oh, hi, Gladys. Hi.

13:00.230 --> 13:03.240
Fancy seeing you here.

13:03.259 --> 13:06.169
This is my mom, Maya.

13:06.190 --> 13:09.159
- It's so nice to meet you.

13:06.190 --> 13:09.159
I'm sorry my grip is so weak.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.039
You see, I am not well.

13:11.059 --> 13:13.000
At least with one kidney,

13:13.019 --> 13:16.159
there's less weight for me

13:13.019 --> 13:16.159
to carry around on these legs.

13:16.179 --> 13:21.000
- Oh, I understand.

13:16.179 --> 13:21.000
I have health problems myself.

13:21.019 --> 13:22.269
The Big C.

13:21.019 --> 13:22.269
- Oh.

13:22.289 --> 13:25.129
- Yeah, but, you know,

13:22.289 --> 13:25.129
since you beat it and all,

13:25.149 --> 13:26.269
I just had a crazy idea.

13:26.289 --> 13:29.059
I wonder if your necklace

13:26.289 --> 13:29.059
might help my mom.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.279
- Oh, I understand.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.169
- Thank you.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.169
- But, no.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.059
- What?

13:32.190 --> 13:34.059
- I can't take this off.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.179
It's almost completely

13:34.080 --> 13:37.179
cleared up my colitis.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.279
- What?

13:37.200 --> 13:38.279
- Huh?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.220
I thought you said

13:39.000 --> 13:40.220
you had the Big C.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.159
- Yes, the Big C--

13:40.240 --> 13:42.159
colitis.

13:42.179 --> 13:45.129
- No, the Big C is cancer.

13:42.179 --> 13:45.129
- Cancer?

13:45.149 --> 13:47.159
- Yes.

13:45.149 --> 13:47.159
- I don't have that.

13:47.179 --> 13:48.269
- She does.

13:47.179 --> 13:48.269
- Oh!

13:48.289 --> 13:51.279
- Sorry. Good luck.

13:48.289 --> 13:51.279
- Oh.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.179
Did you guys hear that?

13:53.200 --> 13:56.009
She misrepresented the Big C.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.009
- We heard.

13:56.029 --> 13:57.230
I don't know

13:56.029 --> 13:57.230
if you're willing to take

13:57.250 --> 13:59.080
a different approach on this,

13:59.100 --> 14:01.029
but I can, uh, undo the clasp

13:59.100 --> 14:01.029
on any woman.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.169
That's right--

14:01.049 --> 14:02.169
I practice on jewelry

14:02.190 --> 14:04.039
to get ready for bras, so...

14:04.059 --> 14:06.039
- Who's this disgusting man?

14:04.059 --> 14:06.039
- Don't worry about it.

14:06.059 --> 14:07.080
Yeah, Griff, do it.

Go, go, go.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.159
- Now?

- Now!

- Uh, well, I'm Chewey,

14:09.250 --> 14:11.059

14:11.080 --> 14:14.269
and my people have a beef

about all that.

Oh, thank you.

14:29.090 --> 14:33.049
Oh. Ah...

14:33.070 --> 14:36.090
Griff, did you unclasp

14:33.070 --> 14:36.090
my bra?

14:36.110 --> 14:37.250
- Yeah, I was just

14:36.110 --> 14:37.250
all warmed up on the necklace.

14:37.269 --> 14:39.200
I mean--

14:37.269 --> 14:39.200
- That's disgusting.

14:39.220 --> 14:42.049
Mom, we got to go.

- You are wearing the necklace.

14:50.259 --> 14:52.200
- Um, yeah. Of course I am.

14:52.220 --> 14:54.250
Did you think I lost it

14:52.220 --> 14:54.250
or something?

and a very heavily accented

Brooklyn voice outside my head,

15:00.179 --> 15:02.200

Oh, I love you.

15:02.220 --> 15:04.200
- I love you.

for our anniversary.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.000
They told us not to spy

15:09.220 --> 15:11.000
on them.

- Oh, my God.

15:11.019 --> 15:12.200
That is too sweet.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.250
Okay, let's go spy on them.

it's our beach-aversary.

I made you a necklace 'cause

15:16.269 --> 15:18.259

15:18.279 --> 15:20.039
that I was in love with you.

15:20.059 --> 15:21.230
- I have been, too, David.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.200
- Weird, but cute.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.200
- Yeah.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.159
- But I'm not sure

15:23.220 --> 15:25.159
you're right for me.

15:25.179 --> 15:27.200
- What is she talking about?

15:27.220 --> 15:29.009
- Cut, pause.

15:27.220 --> 15:29.009
Hold up.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.250
Does that feel like

15:29.029 --> 15:30.250
what Mom should say?

15:30.269 --> 15:34.110
- Yeah, I mean, it's exactly

15:30.269 --> 15:34.110
what she wrote in her journal.

15:34.129 --> 15:36.039
See?

15:34.129 --> 15:36.039
- No. What? No.

15:36.059 --> 15:37.259
- In your journal? No, no.

15:36.059 --> 15:37.259
- Wait, wait. No.

16:26.129 --> 16:28.110
my journals back.

16:28.129 --> 16:30.100
you're not enjoying reliving

16:30.120 --> 16:32.059
what must have been one of

16:30.120 --> 16:32.059
the most emo days of your life?

16:32.080 --> 16:35.019
Okay, David, you can't hold me

16:32.080 --> 16:35.019
to stuff I wrote in my 20s.

16:35.039 --> 16:37.059
That girl was dumb!

16:35.039 --> 16:37.059
- Yeah, so dumb.

She even changed her name

16:37.080 --> 16:40.029
to Stefahni for a year!

16:40.049 --> 16:41.090
- Yeah, that's true.

16:41.110 --> 16:43.120
Look, that Emet

16:41.110 --> 16:43.120
wasn't mature enough

16:43.139 --> 16:45.019
to appreciate

16:43.139 --> 16:45.019
your sentimentality.

16:45.039 --> 16:46.230
But this one does.

16:45.039 --> 16:46.230
- Okay, quiet.

16:46.250 --> 16:49.009
- Emet, to celebrate

16:46.250 --> 16:49.009
our first anniversary,

16:49.029 --> 16:51.169
I will release 50 doves.

16:51.190 --> 16:53.070
[crowd groans]

16:53.090 --> 16:55.110
[laughter]

16:55.129 --> 16:57.070
- And you never appreciated

16:55.129 --> 16:57.070
the doves.

16:57.090 --> 17:00.269
- Ah! Give me drugs!

16:57.090 --> 17:00.269
Give me drugs!

17:00.289 --> 17:04.140
Get this thing out of me!

17:04.160 --> 17:07.119
- That's actually pretty

17:04.160 --> 17:07.119
accurate. [clears throat]

17:07.140 --> 17:09.009
[crowd aws]

17:09.029 --> 17:12.130
- She's the most beautiful

17:09.029 --> 17:12.130
thing I've ever seen.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.279
Let's name her Lily Elizabeth.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.250
I can't stop smiling.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.250
- Yeah, okay, that--

17:18.269 --> 17:20.079
It's bull[bleep].

17:18.269 --> 17:20.079
You didn't smile.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.130
You told me to stop crying

17:20.099 --> 17:22.130
and get you some ice.

17:22.150 --> 17:25.170
- Hey, don't yell at my wife!

17:22.150 --> 17:25.170
- Hey, the play is inaccurate!

17:25.190 --> 17:27.099
- Okay, you know what?

17:25.190 --> 17:27.099
It's wonderful.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.029
- What?

17:27.119 --> 17:29.029
- God!

17:29.049 --> 17:31.079
- Honey? Thanks, everyone.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.079
Honey? Honey!

17:31.099 --> 17:33.069
Please just listen to me.

17:31.099 --> 17:33.069
I'm so sorry.

17:33.089 --> 17:34.150
- Stop it. No, no, no.

17:33.089 --> 17:34.150
- Honey.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.130
Honey, listen to me!

17:34.170 --> 17:36.130
I am sorry, okay?

17:36.150 --> 17:38.150
I did not mean to hurt you.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.150
Just tell me how to fix this.

17:38.170 --> 17:40.089
You want me to do

17:38.170 --> 17:40.089
that grapefruit thing?

17:40.109 --> 17:41.180
- No, no. Do not tempt me

17:40.109 --> 17:41.180
with citrus erotica.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.119
Maybe you can't fix this.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.119
- Okay.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.289
- Maybe we are just

17:43.140 --> 17:45.289
two different people.

17:46.009 --> 17:47.079
- David--

17:46.009 --> 17:47.079
- You know what?

17:47.099 --> 17:49.039
I will ride

17:47.099 --> 17:49.039
this party out...

17:49.059 --> 17:52.029
and then I'm going to go

17:49.059 --> 17:52.029
to a hotel...by myself.

17:52.049 --> 17:53.109
- Okay.

17:52.049 --> 17:53.109
- Thank you.

17:53.130 --> 17:55.039
No, actually, you know what?

17:55.059 --> 17:56.289
- What?

17:55.059 --> 17:56.289
- With my boys!

17:57.009 --> 17:58.279
Oh, yeah.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.279
Hey, Josh and Kevin!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.190
All right, we're going to a

17:59.000 --> 18:01.190
hotel--anniversary after-party.

18:01.210 --> 18:06.039
[upbeat music]

18:06.059 --> 18:08.039
- Yo.

18:06.059 --> 18:08.039
- Whoa.

18:08.059 --> 18:10.130
- Hey, uh, sorry we're late--

18:08.059 --> 18:10.130
it's just, like, you know,

18:10.150 --> 18:12.089
we weren't going to come.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.089
- Yeah, Norman made us.

18:12.109 --> 18:14.039
- We had to return

18:12.109 --> 18:14.039
Emet's box here.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.130
Heads-up, it's either full

18:14.059 --> 18:16.130
of, like, loose peppercorns,

18:16.150 --> 18:19.000
or it's probably, like,

18:16.150 --> 18:19.000
a rat's toilet.

18:19.019 --> 18:20.170
We had to throw a lot

18:19.019 --> 18:20.170
of stuff out.

18:20.190 --> 18:23.000
- But we saved a bunch of stuff

18:20.190 --> 18:23.000
that you wanted to keep,

18:23.019 --> 18:24.259
and it is all yours,

18:23.019 --> 18:24.259
Big Papa D.

18:24.279 --> 18:26.200
- Oh, yeah,

18:24.279 --> 18:26.200
big fan, by the way.

18:26.220 --> 18:29.049
- Thanks, guys. I'm surprised

18:26.220 --> 18:29.049
she kept anything, you know.

18:29.069 --> 18:31.069
I mean,

18:29.069 --> 18:31.069
what makes Emet's cut?

18:31.089 --> 18:34.000
Let's see.

18:34.019 --> 18:36.089
Oh, wow.

18:36.109 --> 18:39.000
I made the cut.

18:36.109 --> 18:39.000
It's a sketch of me.

18:39.019 --> 18:41.000
Um...

18:41.019 --> 18:43.049
It's kind of

18:41.019 --> 18:43.049
a weird thing to say

18:43.069 --> 18:46.049
about a drawing of yourself,

18:43.069 --> 18:46.049
but that's amazing.

18:46.069 --> 18:47.180
She--

18:49.150 --> 18:52.269
Excuse me.

18:49.150 --> 18:52.269
- You're welcome.

18:52.289 --> 18:55.009
- Thank you so much.

18:52.289 --> 18:55.009
[clears throat]

18:55.029 --> 18:58.130
[soft music]

18:58.150 --> 19:00.160
- Hey, um...

19:00.180 --> 19:02.079
can you tell me

19:00.180 --> 19:02.079
what this is?

19:02.099 --> 19:04.049
- Okay.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.049
- Mm-hmm.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.079
- I drew you for my art class

19:05.160 --> 19:08.079
final in college.

19:08.099 --> 19:10.069
- Okay, you never told me that.

19:10.089 --> 19:12.059
- I, um--I did it that night

19:12.079 --> 19:14.160
that you were super sick and we

19:12.079 --> 19:14.160
were in my studio apartment

19:14.180 --> 19:16.109
with, like, zero heat.

19:16.130 --> 19:18.069
I remember I held back your

19:16.130 --> 19:18.069
ponytail while you threw up,

19:18.089 --> 19:19.269
and then we'd snuggle

19:18.089 --> 19:19.269
in between,

19:19.289 --> 19:21.160
which was very gross--

19:19.289 --> 19:21.160
you were very clammy.

19:21.180 --> 19:23.019
- Yeah.

19:23.039 --> 19:26.059
- Then when

19:23.039 --> 19:26.059
you finally passed out...

19:26.079 --> 19:28.069
I couldn't stop thinking

19:26.079 --> 19:28.069
about how much I loved you.

19:28.089 --> 19:31.279
So I drew this.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.289
I guess that's

19:32.000 --> 19:33.289
the night I knew.

19:34.009 --> 19:37.019
- So we kind of have

19:34.009 --> 19:37.019
a sketch-aversary.

19:37.039 --> 19:38.210
- Okay, sure.

19:37.039 --> 19:38.210
Yes, we do.

19:38.230 --> 19:41.029
- I love that.

19:38.230 --> 19:41.029
- Oh, God.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.069
Look, honey, I'm so sorry

19:43.089 --> 19:45.220
for what I said about the

19:43.089 --> 19:45.220
necklace in my journals, okay?

19:45.240 --> 19:47.130
And your hips.

19:47.150 --> 19:49.069
- I don't care about that--

19:47.150 --> 19:49.069
I was just worried that

19:49.089 --> 19:51.109
you don't have the same passion

19:49.089 --> 19:51.109
for me that I have for you.

19:51.130 --> 19:54.029
- Oh, come on.

19:51.130 --> 19:54.029
Of course I do.

19:54.049 --> 19:56.089
Look, David,

19:54.049 --> 19:56.089
I'm never going to be the girl

19:56.109 --> 19:58.019
that releases

19:56.109 --> 19:58.019
50 doves, okay?

19:58.039 --> 19:59.180
Mainly because they carry

19:58.039 --> 19:59.180
encephalitis.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.130
But...

20:01.150 --> 20:04.180
I feel 50 doves

20:01.150 --> 20:04.180
in my heart for you.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.180
And, God, that has got

20:04.200 --> 20:06.180
to be corny enough

20:06.200 --> 20:08.029
to count for something.

20:08.049 --> 20:09.119
- I'll take it.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.140
- Good, 'cause it's

20:09.140 --> 20:11.140
all I've got.

20:13.089 --> 20:15.069
- Ah, this is worse

20:13.089 --> 20:15.069
than when I walked in

20:15.089 --> 20:18.049
on my grandma showering

20:15.089 --> 20:18.049
and the door locked behind me.

20:18.069 --> 20:19.190
- We're going to go.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.079
- Oh.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.079
- Okay.

20:21.099 --> 20:23.140
- Oh, by the way,

20:21.099 --> 20:23.140
the gift was from all of us.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.079
- The--

20:23.160 --> 20:25.079
- Art that I drew?

20:25.099 --> 20:28.029
- Yep, you're welcome.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.029
- Okay.

20:28.049 --> 20:31.230
Maybe I'm not as sentimental

20:28.049 --> 20:31.230
as David, but I do care.

20:31.250 --> 20:35.180
It's just I realize that he

20:31.250 --> 20:35.180
focuses on the grand gestures

20:35.200 --> 20:37.089
and I focus

20:35.200 --> 20:37.089
on the little moments

20:37.109 --> 20:39.079
that shouldn't mean anything

20:37.109 --> 20:39.079
but do.

20:39.099 --> 20:41.089
Oh, God, now I'm gonna puke.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.150
- Hey, you guys,

20:41.109 --> 20:43.150
come here for one sec.

20:43.170 --> 20:45.150
Lily, I'm really sorry

20:43.170 --> 20:45.150
I yelled at you.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.200
I mean, in my defense, you were

20:45.170 --> 20:47.200
pretending to be your mother.

20:47.220 --> 20:50.000
- So you guys

20:47.220 --> 20:50.000
are not getting a divorce?

20:50.019 --> 20:52.140
- What? No.

20:50.019 --> 20:52.140
- No. Oh, my gosh.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.200
- Of course we're not.

20:53.220 --> 20:56.029
- Yes, our plan worked.

20:53.220 --> 20:56.029
- [sighs]

20:56.049 --> 20:57.190
- Oh.

20:56.049 --> 20:57.190
- Okay.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.079
- Oh, good news.

20:59.099 --> 21:02.029
Daddy's coming back

20:59.099 --> 21:02.029
from his trip one day early.

21:02.049 --> 21:03.089
- Well, Mother,

21:02.049 --> 21:03.089
of course he is.

21:03.109 --> 21:04.160
You didn't answer

21:03.109 --> 21:04.160
his phone calls.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.059
He probably thinks

21:06.079 --> 21:07.150
you're pinned

21:06.079 --> 21:07.150
under a bookcase somewhere.

21:07.170 --> 21:09.099
- I was playing

21:07.170 --> 21:09.099
hard to get.

21:09.119 --> 21:13.150
Tonight when he comes back,

21:09.119 --> 21:13.150
I'll be extremely easy to get.

21:13.170 --> 21:17.220
Oh! Dunka, dunka, dunka,

21:13.170 --> 21:17.220
dunka, dunka, dunka.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.200
Dunka, dunka, dunka,

21:17.240 --> 21:20.200
dunka, dunka, dunka.

21:20.220 --> 21:22.099
- Where the hell is that Uber?

21:22.119 --> 21:24.009
- Just cancel it.

21:22.119 --> 21:24.009
We'll walk.

21:24.029 --> 21:26.009
- Yeah, we need to leave

21:24.029 --> 21:26.009
this geriatric orgy. Bye.

21:26.029 --> 21:27.140
Good-bye.

21:26.029 --> 21:27.140
Bye, strange people.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.130
- Dunka, dunka, dunka,

21:27.160 --> 21:30.130
dunka, dunka. dunka.
