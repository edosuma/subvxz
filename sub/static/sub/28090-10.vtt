- Omm.
- Omm.

38:11.032 --> 38:12.622
- Whaaat?
- Whaaat...

38:12.625 --> 38:13.757
do you think?

38:15.135 --> 38:16.601
Maybe our handshake's just for us.

38:16.603 --> 38:17.836
- Secret club.
- Mm-hmm.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.189
Did he talk to you

38:19.192 --> 38:21.126
about whatever it was
you needed to talk about?

38:22.876 --> 38:24.175
He did.

38:25.652 --> 38:26.785
Good job.

38:28.782 --> 38:30.181
No more handshake.

38:31.384 --> 38:32.716
So...

38:32.719 --> 38:35.119
you're officially in that phase
where your woman controls you

38:35.121 --> 38:36.788
and tells you what
you can and cannot do.

38:36.790 --> 38:37.655
Yeah.

38:37.657 --> 38:38.723
How is that phase?

38:38.725 --> 38:40.391
- Inevitable.
- Oh.

38:40.393 --> 38:41.960
What up, "Death Wish"?

38:41.962 --> 38:42.994
Hey. [SIGHS]

38:42.996 --> 38:44.629
So, we recovered Griffin's laptop.

38:44.631 --> 38:46.731
It's encrypted, and it'll
take Standish a while,

38:46.733 --> 38:47.799
but he'll crack it.

38:47.801 --> 38:49.033
You really think Griffin's dumb enough

38:49.035 --> 38:50.646
to leave all that intel
about the Trust on there?

38:50.648 --> 38:51.769
I do.

38:51.771 --> 38:53.771
Yeah, I mean, look, that's
the thing about guys like that.

38:53.773 --> 38:55.573
They never think
they're gonna get caught.

38:55.575 --> 38:57.175
But we're gonna get 'em all, Frankie.

38:57.177 --> 38:58.610
We're gonna take down Ollerman.

38:59.390 --> 39:01.613
Hey, when we find him, are
you gonna be regular Will,

39:01.615 --> 39:03.448
or you think you're
gonna go all psycho again?

39:03.450 --> 39:05.450
[CHUCKLES] No. I'll leave
the psycho part to you.

39:05.452 --> 39:06.918
You're much better at it than I am.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.152
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

39:08.154 --> 39:10.488
Two of me isn't as
much fun as I thought.

39:10.490 --> 39:11.890
How do you handle me?

39:11.892 --> 39:13.558
Uh, that's a tough question...

39:13.560 --> 39:15.527
That I'm not sure I
should answer to your face.

39:15.529 --> 39:17.562
But I was talking to
my therapist about it,

39:17.564 --> 39:20.098
uh, and my life coach, um...

39:20.100 --> 39:22.600
and, actually, my Transcendental
Meditation coach...

39:24.638 --> 39:26.271
And that's how I handle you.

39:26.273 --> 39:30.341
Ray, you were...

39:30.343 --> 39:32.777
an itch that I had to scratch.

39:32.779 --> 39:35.647
And I did that, and now it is over.

39:35.649 --> 39:37.982
And it just cannot happen again.

39:39.184 --> 39:40.217
Never?

39:40.220 --> 39:42.186
One of the things that I'm most proud of

39:42.188 --> 39:44.689
is that I don't repeat mistakes.

39:44.691 --> 39:46.024
Especially not mistakes

39:46.026 --> 39:49.027
that make me feel bad
about myself as a person.

39:49.906 --> 39:51.062
I'm sorry.

39:51.064 --> 39:53.731
No, I...

39:53.733 --> 39:56.267
I totally understand.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.569
[SIGHING] Okay.

39:59.139 --> 40:01.673
Do you... still want me to
go wait for you in the car?

40:01.675 --> 40:03.174
Yeah.

40:03.176 --> 40:04.943
[CHUCKLES]

40:08.481 --> 40:09.647
Uh, good night, everybody.

40:09.649 --> 40:11.149
I got a... meeting to...

40:11.151 --> 40:12.817
[DOOR OPENS]

40:14.354 --> 40:15.453
Hey, guys.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.455
I'd like to, uh, I'd
like to make a toast.

40:19.693 --> 40:20.959
Hey.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.894
I just wanted to say how
much you all mean to me

40:22.896 --> 40:24.395
and thank you guys for stepping up

40:24.397 --> 40:25.964
when I... When I needed it the most.

40:25.966 --> 40:27.031
I appreciate it.

40:28.234 --> 40:29.467
We love you, Will.

40:29.469 --> 40:30.935
And we owed it to Emma.

40:30.937 --> 40:31.936
I agree.

40:31.938 --> 40:33.137
So, let's raise our glasses.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.173
Wait. Before we drink...

40:35.175 --> 40:36.808
At Langley, when we lose someone,

40:36.810 --> 40:39.277
we put a star on the wall.

40:39.279 --> 40:40.378
No name.

40:40.380 --> 40:43.781
Just... a star to honor their service.

40:43.783 --> 40:45.516
Wow.

40:45.518 --> 40:46.584
Thank you.

40:49.422 --> 40:50.989
- All right. To Emma.
- To Emma.

40:50.991 --> 40:52.090
- To Emma.
- To Emma.

40:52.092 --> 40:53.591
[GLASSES CLINK]

40:53.593 --> 40:56.194
Now, I think it'd be smart
if we all drank way too much.

40:56.196 --> 40:57.195
[LAUGHTER]

40:57.197 --> 40:58.429
One step ahead of you.

40:58.431 --> 40:59.764
- Oh!
- Oh, hey!

40:59.766 --> 41:00.832
I like that.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.333
Thank you.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.668
[GLASSES CLINK]

41:03.670 --> 41:06.270
Oh. Is that your gun, or
are you just happy to see me?

41:06.272 --> 41:08.006
Both.

41:09.643 --> 41:10.675
Hey, guys.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.443
I want to thank you

41:12.445 --> 41:14.846
for letting me be a part of your family.

41:14.848 --> 41:16.214
Of course.

41:16.216 --> 41:17.121
Cheers.

41:17.124 --> 41:18.216
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
