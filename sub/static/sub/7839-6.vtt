00:25.005 --> 00:27.562
This season should be joyous ....

00:27.746 --> 00:28.595
mid-June? 

00:31.664 --> 00:34.246
The children, the night 
holiest of the year ... 

00:34.295 --> 00:36.066
Tomorrow is Father's Day, 

00:36.219 --> 00:39.510
which makes the vigil tonight 
for Father's Day. 

00:39.969 --> 00:44.973
Joy to the world, a father was born. 

00:44.992 --> 00:48.607
Give me great gifts 

00:48.792 --> 00:52.113
Papa, there is no vigil 
for Father's Day. 

00:53.398 --> 00:55.298
No vigil Father's Day? 

00:55.402 --> 00:58.857
This means that there 
no ... Paternal Christmas? 

01:00.104 --> 01:02.115
Very well, there are ... 

01:02.216 --> 01:03.446
Is there a Rabbit the SuperBowl? 

01:03.630 --> 01:04.888
Of course, why not? 

01:07.871 --> 01:08.955
Bart, Lisa. 

01:09.046 --> 01:11.309
We must go to the center 
commercial before it closes. 

01:11.465 --> 01:13.577
Oh, I can come with you? 

01:13.691 --> 01:14.673
I know I can not ... 

01:17.643 --> 01:19.967
Hey, Mom, I might have a little 
money to buy Dad a gift? 

01:20.041 --> 01:24.076
If I give you the money, what 
The gift comes from you? 

01:24.136 --> 01:25.009
Where you get your money? 

01:26.330 --> 01:27.093
That is 10. 

01:27.129 --> 01:28.195
Make your own card. 

01:36.078 --> 01:38.223
Ralph, let me explain 
again. 

01:38.242 --> 01:41.512
I give you $ 5, and you 
buy a gift for Dad. 

01:44.074 --> 01:45.244
Hey, hey, give me that. 

01:46.530 --> 01:48.302
It is a ticket of 50. 

01:48.515 --> 01:50.299
This kid finally refund. 

01:50.767 --> 01:53.565
Very well, Ralph, look at what 
you can do with a 100 bill. 

01:54.758 --> 01:55.533
Go, Ralph. 

01:55.619 --> 01:57.021
A big ticket. A big ticket, Ralph. 

01:58.997 --> 01:59.415
A big ticket ... 

02:10.820 --> 02:11.804
Cool. 

02:18.294 --> 02:19.105
That is what I am. 

02:19.142 --> 02:19.831
And you? 

02:19.868 --> 02:22.179
I am afraid that the best thing 
I could find was that. 

02:24.798 --> 02:27.079
You know, produced the saloperies 
mass do 

02:27.079 --> 02:28.978
not what I feel for Dad. 

02:29.970 --> 02:32.872
I'll give her a gift that comes from the heart. 

02:37.394 --> 02:39.337
Hello. I'm looking for something 

02:39.337 --> 02:43.133
to clean the pipes, foldable, 
covered with a light duvet. 

02:44.244 --> 02:46.334
This just arrived from Zanzibar. 

02:49.613 --> 02:51.664
What Father's day super! 

02:51.949 --> 02:52.699
And now, Dad. 

02:52.785 --> 02:53.585
I hope you will love. 

02:53.717 --> 02:54.884
I forgot what it was. 

02:56.628 --> 02:58.338
A friend of leather. 

02:58.460 --> 03:00.747
There is no limit to what 
I can do with that. 

03:01.717 --> 03:04.226
Do not fear me, milady, 
Captain Superstud Dash 

03:04.238 --> 03:06.537
is here with his small tool. 

03:19.615 --> 03:22.170
It is the worst Father's day ... 

03:24.613 --> 03:27.098
Captain, you are so strong. 

03:27.963 --> 03:31.087
Bart is the best gift 
I've never received. 

03:31.098 --> 03:32.413
Open another gift now 

03:32.450 --> 03:36.654
would be like to go to a concert 
Jessica Simpson after going to the opera. 

03:36.728 --> 03:37.800
What you, Lisa? 

03:38.562 --> 03:39.785
Fuck what is it? 

03:41.144 --> 03:43.193
Unicorns is you and me, Dad. 

03:43.215 --> 03:44.450
I've designed myself. 

03:48.714 --> 03:49.796
What do you think? 

03:50.964 --> 03:51.936
A slight twinge in the heart? 

03:53.593 --> 03:54.800
It is moving. 

03:54.829 --> 03:56.722
We can not deny it. 

03:56.882 --> 03:58.097
Thank you, baby. 

03:59.398 --> 04:00.729
You have not loved, is not it? 

04:00.850 --> 04:02.181
No, no, no, it's great. 

04:02.198 --> 04:03.603
I can turn the page now. 

04:05.469 --> 04:08.434
Lisa, honey, I think your father 

04:08.469 --> 04:10.190
would put the book on the fridge 

04:10.227 --> 04:12.442
where everyone can see 
how beautiful it is. 

04:14.880 --> 04:16.762
Oh, is it cabbage? 

04:21.708 --> 04:22.548
Oh, Dad ... 

04:22.611 --> 04:23.967
How could you? 

04:24.027 --> 04:25.611
Well, it's not my fault. 

04:25.760 --> 04:27.184
Magnet rotten! 

04:28.498 --> 04:29.260
Oh, no, no ... 

04:33.008 --> 04:33.783
What is ... "Happy birthday, Dad! 

04:33.832 --> 04:34.287
Signed Lisa " 

04:41.357 --> 04:44.112
I still do not understand 
I saw how the injury. 

04:44.350 --> 04:45.468
This is my day. 

04:45.530 --> 04:47.492
It will not forget it quickly. 

04:47.817 --> 04:48.735
I know women. 

04:48.802 --> 04:50.720
Yeah, but I know how 
returning women. 

04:50.843 --> 04:54.126
I brought you back even after losing 
our wedding album in a bet. 

04:54.224 --> 04:55.380
You what? 

04:55.491 --> 04:57.331
I mean, I'll return. 

04:58.556 --> 05:01.769
And voila Moe with a pretty girl 

05:01.783 --> 05:05.867
because it is something that 
happens in real life. 

05:08.655 --> 05:10.339
Hey, Moe, one might have to drink? 

05:10.462 --> 05:12.233
Shut up and pass me to other heads of Moe. 

05:20.720 --> 05:22.300
Cool, I'm a street. 

05:22.460 --> 05:24.874
Hey, Simpson, are you going to steal the sign? 

05:25.034 --> 05:27.038
Seems that if your name is on a panel, 

05:27.075 --> 05:29.928
you can take, and the cops 
can do nothing against that. 

05:30.173 --> 05:32.183
On the 6th amendment. 

05:32.290 --> 05:36.360
Well, the panel would look 
cool hidden under my bed. 

05:40.176 --> 05:43.246
Woah. We should just stop 
to manipulate kids, right? 

05:44.013 --> 05:45.304
Hey, Milhouse! 

05:45.541 --> 05:48.699
The cool kids go cycling eyes closed. 

05:48.782 --> 05:50.322
I am cool! 

05:55.810 --> 05:56.531
I am going. 

05:56.568 --> 05:58.038
I Hebrew school. 

05:58.111 --> 06:01.136
Baruch Atah Adonai eloheem. 

06:01.380 --> 06:02.509
Melech h'olom ... 

06:07.232 --> 06:09.234
I am sorry to have you made sad, darling ... 

06:09.467 --> 06:12.833
But I'll show you how 
m'importent point your feelings. 

06:12.957 --> 06:14.471
An adult and a baby, please. 

06:14.634 --> 06:15.434
I am not a baby. 

06:15.483 --> 06:17.612
A baby is 0 to 2 years. 

06:17.908 --> 06:20.129
His first words. 

06:20.228 --> 06:21.088
Play the game 

06:21.149 --> 06:23.535
That is 50 cents less for babies. 

06:23.659 --> 06:25.450
I prefer not to go rather than lying. 

06:28.746 --> 06:29.355
How are you? 

06:30.492 --> 06:34.206
Uh ... It's your jacket on 
back of your chair? 

06:35.749 --> 06:36.544
Look, 

06:36.831 --> 06:38.134
I stole the panel. 

06:38.257 --> 06:38.933
Look, 

06:39.037 --> 06:40.623
it was stolen "Le cri" 

06:40.709 --> 06:41.484
Cache it. 

06:41.533 --> 06:42.616
Il me fait peur. 

06:43.989 --> 06:47.615
Stupid father who cares 
my feelings. 

06:47.934 --> 06:50.707
Oh, Lisa, then I t'emprunter one 
your crayons? 

06:50.968 --> 06:54.312
Of course, is what all men 
do, take, take and take 

06:54.336 --> 06:56.603
without attention to 
feelings and unicorns. 

06:58.291 --> 07:00.381
Here, take my meal too. 

07:00.706 --> 07:02.783
Even while taking my backpack! 

07:05.313 --> 07:09.781
Which of the boys initiated the bag 
Lisa back through my window? 

07:09.898 --> 07:13.033
Oh, it must be a boy, is not it? 

07:13.070 --> 07:14.932
You do not think a girl 
can not blow a cable? 

07:14.975 --> 07:16.340
Well, you're wrong! 

07:19.523 --> 07:21.342
My plaster. 

07:28.190 --> 07:29.112
Lisa ... 

07:29.396 --> 07:32.556
I wish in my hand a spine 
with a sad face on it. 

07:32.605 --> 07:35.272
Do me not to paste it on your record. 

07:35.395 --> 07:37.588
Do me not to paste it on your record. 

07:39.079 --> 07:41.254
J'enlève back ... 

07:41.549 --> 07:43.558
Do not get me that ... 

07:45.174 --> 07:47.429
God forgive me ... 

07:53.518 --> 07:55.903
Willie, rats were again 
mâchouillé cables. 

07:56.014 --> 07:56.997
Leave me in peace. 

07:57.108 --> 07:58.891
I am pasta ramen. 

08:02.661 --> 08:06.890
Mr and Mrs Simpson, I am afraid that 
is a real problem with Lisa. 

08:11.226 --> 08:13.068
Your daughter broke a window, 
overturned wastebasket, 

08:14.762 --> 08:15.671
and launched a thermos in the street! 

08:17.740 --> 08:19.848
It can still keep drinks 
hot and cold? 

08:20.317 --> 08:22.816
I'm afraid it keeps more 
no drink now. 

08:23.929 --> 08:27.170
I asked the psychologist 
School enlighten us 

08:27.447 --> 08:28.671
on the sudden explosion 
inconveniences of your daughter. 

08:30.510 --> 08:33.125
I fear that rabies Lisa 
comes from an extraordinary 

08:33.373 --> 08:35.582
disillusionment due to a parent figure. 

08:35.847 --> 08:37.626
In this case, his father. 

08:38.152 --> 08:41.582
Ho, of course, it is easy to 
Blame me. 

08:41.816 --> 08:43.467
It's harder to close. 

08:43.885 --> 08:46.709
As shown in testing your daughter, 
this is not a new 

08:46.904 --> 08:47.633
trend. 

08:47.827 --> 08:49.263
"The Thanksgiving with Dad in the cabbage" 

08:49.499 --> 08:50.809
"Left in the grand canyon" 

08:51.006 --> 08:53.152
"The day is a policeman 
come to my football tournament. " 

08:53.873 --> 08:57.105
Mr Simpson, Lisa is at a junction cruel. 

08:57.424 --> 09:00.297
If she does not see his father 
as a positive model, 

09:00.681 --> 09:02.967
it could hate men all his life. 

09:03.321 --> 09:04.658
Oh, I know! 

09:04.923 --> 09:07.478
But how can I fix 
eight years crétinerie 

09:07.821 --> 09:10.752
After two singles and not cost me anything? 

09:11.052 --> 09:12.646
Can I make a suggestion? 

09:13.867 --> 09:16.951
The school seeks a new 
"Safe-Salamander." 

09:17.346 --> 09:19.354
When Lisa you will teach children 

09:19.570 --> 09:21.114
to avoid power lines 
fallen, it will make 

09:21.288 --> 09:23.160
regain faith in you 
and the masculine gender. 

09:23.663 --> 09:24.797
I do not know. 

09:24.995 --> 09:26.579
What happened in the last Securi-Salamander? 

09:26.904 --> 09:29.078
He is asleep in the costume and suffocated. 

09:29.373 --> 09:30.943
I can do it! 

09:31.203 --> 09:33.854
Ok, Lisa is the time 
the big surprise Dad! 

09:34.849 --> 09:39.490
Sometimes it's scary when your 
dreams come true, is not it 

09:39.710 --> 09:40.587
honey? 

09:40.777 --> 09:41.848
I suppose. 

09:42.068 --> 09:42.775
Yeah. 

09:42.936 --> 09:45.056
I am responsible for bringing 
Security in primary school 

09:45.235 --> 09:46.581
Springfield and regain your love! 

09:48.741 --> 09:49.960
What there was treasure? 

09:50.120 --> 09:51.079
I do not thee well. 

09:52.360 --> 09:54.741
Salamander out! 

09:59.444 --> 10:00.843
Sorry Bart! 

10:01.367 --> 10:03.959
The first rule in the bus 
Security is always put your 

10:04.126 --> 10:04.789
belt. 

10:05.094 --> 10:07.034
The school bus never belts. 

10:07.323 --> 10:09.142
So what protects you 
if we have an accident? 

10:09.476 --> 10:11.398
A metal bar at the teeth. 

10:11.730 --> 10:13.084
Stop that bus! 

10:13.613 --> 10:15.634
My teeth! 

10:16.247 --> 10:18.834
Look Lisa, I showed security. 

10:20.883 --> 10:22.436
Council 99: 

10:22.678 --> 10:24.516
Always lock your easel twice. 

10:25.344 --> 10:26.435
Son of ... 

10:28.507 --> 10:29.722
Questions or comments? 

10:30.058 --> 10:31.097
Are you a girl? 

10:31.276 --> 10:33.160
Because I do not see any employees sausage 

10:36.078 --> 10:38.198
Do I hear "Where are the fireworks?" 

10:38.525 --> 10:40.554
Because this is! 

10:47.103 --> 10:49.065
Every man for himself! 

10:49.257 --> 10:50.806
Crush if you must! 

10:58.723 --> 11:00.052
Security! Security! 

11:00.362 --> 11:01.955
Die for Security! 

11:03.392 --> 11:10.619
So, dear, I am again your hero? 

11:10.990 --> 11:13.862
Janey's father took him just 
at the zoo once a month. 

11:14.289 --> 11:16.266
You could not be what kind of father? 

11:16.580 --> 11:19.628
Honey, you know that Dad is 
longer allowed to enter the zoo. 

11:20.126 --> 11:21.485
Oh, yeah. 

11:21.800 --> 11:25.081
But I will always 
I buy your eyes. 

11:26.060 --> 11:27.614
How did you do that? 

11:27.964 --> 11:29.373
I do not know. 

11:33.088 --> 11:36.365
I said, turn left at Boulevard Bart! 

11:36.679 --> 11:39.357
I tell you that there is no Boulevard Bart! 

11:40.056 --> 11:41.514
Forget it. 

11:41.772 --> 11:43.176
The baby is already out. 

11:43.485 --> 11:45.483
Sort just your hunting knife 
and cut the cord "ombrilical." 

11:45.891 --> 11:47.624
Yes Ma'am. 

11:51.235 --> 11:52.118
Warning! 

11:53.141 --> 11:55.131
Kent Brockman here, live from the grave 

11:55.368 --> 11:57.543
accident in the history of Springfield. 

11:57.913 --> 12:00.284
But no need to worry, 
emergency services in the city are 

12:00.679 --> 12:01.691
road. 

12:11.484 --> 12:14.123
Can we all agree 
not to involve our insurance? 

12:14.600 --> 12:15.837
Come on, be nice. 

12:18.560 --> 12:21.427
Springfield needs a hero 
and they need it now! 

12:23.371 --> 12:25.685
It looks like a job for a father 
trying to regain the love of his 

12:25.851 --> 12:26.892
girl! 

12:31.632 --> 12:33.108
I will have a debt forever ... 

12:33.480 --> 12:35.126
and my many creditors. 

12:38.866 --> 12:40.680
We were common car and that's all! 

12:47.319 --> 12:48.783
My mother is still in the car! 

12:52.047 --> 12:53.172
No, it's not there. 

12:57.644 --> 12:59.557
Three encouragement for our new hero! 

12:59.885 --> 13:01.326
Only three? 

13:01.912 --> 13:03.306
Ok, six! 

13:04.105 --> 13:05.671
It's better like that! 

13:06.056 --> 13:06.879
Hip-hip hurray! 

13:07.103 --> 13:08.012
Hip-hip hurray! 

13:08.695 --> 13:10.765
Oh, please, you m'embarrassez. 

13:13.523 --> 13:16.668
I submit the highest mark 
Honorary Springfield: 

13:16.881 --> 13:18.802
The key to the city! 

13:22.563 --> 13:23.859
Other problems? 

13:24.165 --> 13:27.175
Mr Mayor, your administration 
has been following a fiasco! 

13:27.710 --> 13:29.209
Who the hell are you? 

13:29.431 --> 13:30.480
Your responsible press. 

13:30.630 --> 13:31.986
I knew I had to hire my nephew. 

13:32.139 --> 13:33.237
I am your nephew. 

13:33.415 --> 13:34.824
Ok, then it stinks. 

13:35.234 --> 13:37.705
Read the charter, gentlemen: 

13:37.915 --> 13:40.142
I can not be transferred to the office. 

13:40.337 --> 13:43.870
Except election by a simple reminder ... 

13:44.354 --> 13:47.303
Err, forget the last part. 

13:47.426 --> 13:48.204
A new vote! 

13:48.387 --> 13:49.099
A new vote! 

13:49.272 --> 13:50.038
A new vote! 

14:00.417 --> 14:04.054
Mayor Joe 'Diamond' has Quimby 
survived to 12 re-election campaigns, 

14:04.344 --> 14:06.950
countless accusations of infidelity, 
Corruption, extortion, 

14:07.414 --> 14:10.645
and this bizarre attempted hijacking of a 747. 

14:11.073 --> 14:12.510
Ask the plane anywhere, girls 

14:12.720 --> 14:13.848
become truly wild. 

14:14.251 --> 14:15.845
But the mayor might be more difficult 

14:16.055 --> 14:18.472
through the re-election test 
next week. 

14:18.824 --> 14:20.629
More than 200 people filed their candidacies, 

14:20.831 --> 14:22.720
your servant, Kent Brockman. 

14:23.133 --> 14:25.140
Other news: a classic tool device 

14:25.380 --> 14:26.693
for the household can kill you. 

14:26.882 --> 14:28.059
You can learn more when 

14:28.264 --> 14:29.767
you voted for Kent Brockman. 

14:30.706 --> 14:32.740
My God, all the idiots of the city, more 

14:32.993 --> 14:34.851
Disco Stu will arise against me. 

14:35.055 --> 14:38.063
Just imagine: I think the Mayor. 

14:38.415 --> 14:41.256
So no one made fun of my song! 

14:41.602 --> 14:44.843
I am proud to be American. 

14:45.247 --> 14:46.610
I have done. 

14:49.043 --> 14:50.327
Luigi Vote! 

14:50.639 --> 14:52.318
A good government, just as you like, 

14:52.548 --> 14:53.664
is my priority 

14:53.842 --> 14:57.393
Vote for me, who abuse steroids, 

14:57.664 --> 15:00.279
who smokes grass, chasing women, 

15:00.512 --> 15:03.168
son of Nazi innocent, and Movie Star Has Been. 

15:04.760 --> 15:07.052
And I think it would be good to have a 

15:07.235 --> 15:09.219
open mind on the issue of cloning. 

15:12.764 --> 15:14.645
A monster could win! 

15:14.897 --> 15:16.576
If you are twisted enough, vote for me. 

15:18.010 --> 15:25.144
Jimbo: drive with the poor standard 
even harder with the cons. 

15:25.484 --> 15:26.730
Dad, something must be done. 

15:27.094 --> 15:28.711
What can I do. 

15:28.859 --> 15:29.885
I am only a man. 

15:30.100 --> 15:31.315
Licoln was also a man. 

15:31.500 --> 15:32.552
Are you sure there was no 

15:33.169 --> 15:34.275
a miniature in his hat? 

15:34.418 --> 15:35.367
I read an email about this. 

15:35.614 --> 15:36.860
Listen, as a salamander of security, 

15:37.025 --> 15:38.140
you are loved by all. 

15:38.335 --> 15:40.707
And if you were the mayor, to be sure we pourrins 

15:40.918 --> 15:43.128
only those goods, like me, 
tell you what to do. 

15:44.537 --> 15:46.818
I will apply for the post of Mayor! 

15:47.011 --> 15:49.054
And I will be the manager of your 
electoral campaign! 

15:49.362 --> 15:52.026
And I will discover what a mayor! 

15:52.862 --> 15:55.423
Dilate my brain, oh juice knowledge! 

16:05.610 --> 16:07.234
I hate the press conference. 

16:07.878 --> 16:09.665
Homer is an opportunity to score points, 

16:09.930 --> 16:11.604
so on, you removed your costume salamander. 

16:11.923 --> 16:14.021
You look like the mascot 
one of these horrible 

16:14.181 --> 16:15.449
University of the South. 

16:15.710 --> 16:17.663
Margin, without this costume, I am only Homer Simpson, 

16:18.033 --> 16:19.140
Multi criminal recidivist. 

16:19.408 --> 16:21.822
With, I am a hero in costume, 
as George Washington, 

16:22.167 --> 16:23.352
or Mrs. Edna. 

16:25.249 --> 16:27.437
Today is the dawn of a 
new era for Springfield. 

16:27.796 --> 16:29.858
The salamander is sitting on eggshells 

16:30.111 --> 16:32.789
labeled 'Care for the 3rd age', 
'flexible' 

16:33.014 --> 16:34.544
and 'commercial center in downtown pedestrian. 

16:34.762 --> 16:36.976
And these eggs are ready to hatch. 

16:39.194 --> 16:40.473
Now, I will answer your questions. 

16:40.868 --> 16:42.835
What special powers would 

16:43.148 --> 16:44.767
a salamander in the office of mayor? 

16:45.468 --> 16:48.047
Well, I have a vision similar to X-rays, 

16:48.312 --> 16:52.624
a breath of fire, and I can do 
laugh with tennis balls. 

16:54.485 --> 16:59.253
Wow, I did not know that salamanders could 

16:59.439 --> 17:00.472
do the same things. 

17:00.690 --> 17:02.293
And to think that during all these years 

17:02.521 --> 17:04.087
I was a 'gecko man. 

17:04.763 --> 17:06.090
Tire fool you. 

17:06.343 --> 17:07.864
M Simpson, a reaction on 

17:08.057 --> 17:09.925
this picture of where you strangle your son. 

17:11.037 --> 17:12.425
Why should we let an election be 

17:12.646 --> 17:15.300
influenced by a photo from several hours? 

17:18.156 --> 17:19.710
Now, here candy restaurant 

17:19.944 --> 17:21.246
for everyone. 

17:25.237 --> 17:26.155
Homer, you're out very well. 

17:26.519 --> 17:27.766
you are far ahead of the polls. 

17:28.048 --> 17:29.092
Even those negative ads have 

17:29.350 --> 17:30.642
no effect on you. 

17:31.019 --> 17:32.622
Simpson has virtually no more work. 

17:32.852 --> 17:34.091
It pays for homeless 

17:34.346 --> 17:35.906
it does its work for him. 

17:36.266 --> 17:38.066
I do not feel very well. 

17:39.723 --> 17:41.033
People may not like Homer Simpson, 

17:41.411 --> 17:42.892
but he loves this costume. 

17:43.760 --> 17:45.844
In the same way they love this stupid 

17:46.052 --> 17:47.180
American flag. 

17:51.644 --> 17:53.438
What is that smell? 

17:54.314 --> 17:56.731
It is the smell of imminent victory. 

17:57.716 --> 17:59.196
You vomit in this suit? 

17:59.892 --> 18:01.156
A little. 

18:02.134 --> 18:03.403
Did you at least cleaned this suit 

18:03.727 --> 18:05.113
since you have? 

18:05.613 --> 18:07.144
No, but I swam it. 

18:07.562 --> 18:08.682
I'd better clean this thing. 

18:09.017 --> 18:11.078
It's hard to find the limit 

18:11.308 --> 18:12.546
between man and the costume. 

18:12.918 --> 18:14.890
But what you do not have fun 

18:15.114 --> 18:16.455
in the attempt? 

18:19.764 --> 18:20.961
It's weird. 

18:21.246 --> 18:23.032
At the beginning it was an egg. 

18:25.422 --> 18:27.646
Our next question goes to Eleanor Abernathy, 

18:28.235 --> 18:30.117
also known for Women crazy cats. 

18:30.901 --> 18:32.419
Female cats, how would you 

18:32.796 --> 18:34.768
increase income tax 
Trade in this city? 

18:35.226 --> 18:37.677
Encourage small businesses. 

18:37.912 --> 18:40.356
Corporate responsibility. 

18:41.466 --> 18:44.166
Cats in the pants of everybody. 

18:48.272 --> 18:49.393
Very well, thank you Women cats. 

18:49.736 --> 18:51.091
It is in the debriefing room. 

18:51.520 --> 18:53.118
Okay, okeydokey ... yeah. 

18:53.689 --> 18:56.549
Our next question is for 
Salamander of security. 

18:59.358 --> 19:00.669
Sir, how to fix you 

19:01.059 --> 19:02.813
the crumbling infrastructure of this city. 

19:03.164 --> 19:04.694
This is a very good question Kent. 

19:05.033 --> 19:07.397
First ... 

19:08.365 --> 19:09.676
What is ... ? 

19:10.009 --> 19:11.395
It has certainly narrowed to washing. 

19:11.874 --> 19:14.223
Without his costume, this is nothing other than a man. 

19:14.678 --> 19:16.015
Ok, dropped. 

19:16.301 --> 19:17.927
I will not let a man tell me what to do. 

19:18.483 --> 19:20.096
It is true, I am a man. 

19:20.531 --> 19:22.895
a man dressed as a salamander for 

19:23.088 --> 19:24.939
regain the love of his daughter. 

19:29.475 --> 19:30.166
I will present. 

19:30.495 --> 19:31.688
Well, my son is also there. 

19:32.046 --> 19:33.325
I will present it. 

19:33.732 --> 19:34.992
Here ... Bart! 

19:37.513 --> 19:40.027
What's new? 

19:40.627 --> 19:41.879
Boring. 

19:42.306 --> 19:44.025
It was sick of you and your outbreaks! 

19:46.614 --> 19:49.436
Please stop giving fruit! 

19:52.169 --> 19:53.890
The vote shows that none of the candidates 

19:54.225 --> 19:56.475
has managed to achieve the 5% 
needed for victory. 

19:56.939 --> 19:58.893
And Mayor Joe Quinmby will keep his post 

19:59.163 --> 20:00.932
in any case I did not want. 

20:01.632 --> 20:03.563
You are finished Nazes band. 

20:11.118 --> 20:12.869
Dad, you tried to Springfield 

20:13.175 --> 20:14.529
better city, and in any case, 

20:14.796 --> 20:16.668
it makes you my hero. 

20:19.145 --> 20:20.254
Thank you. 

20:20.490 --> 20:23.020
What do you say a dance with your father? 

20:30.670 --> 20:31.826
I can not believe I lost 

20:32.134 --> 20:33.629
with all the commercials that Ben Affleck has made. 

20:34.172 --> 20:36.255
Yes, I t'avais warned about this. 

20:37.302 --> 20:38.791
Take care of my tail. 

20:39.218 --> 20:41.213
you no longer tail now. 

20:41.668 --> 20:43.996
I know ... I sense yet. 

20:44.935 --> 20:46.839
That so high!
