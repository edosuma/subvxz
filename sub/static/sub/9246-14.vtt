WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.786
[instrumental music]

00:03.873 --> 00:07.703
Chamomile and honey for my lady,
beer and Clamato for me.

00:07.790 --> 00:10.575
Thank you. I don't know how
you drink that stuff?

00:10.662 --> 00:11.968
Right back at you.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.537
Hey, have you given
any thought to what

00:15.624 --> 00:16.842
you like to do
for our honeymoon?

00:16.929 --> 00:20.411
Can I have my heart set
on intercourse?

00:20.498 --> 00:21.891
Obviously, that's contingent
on how much

00:21.978 --> 00:23.240
I drink at the reception.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.981
Oh, no, you'll be
putting out, pal.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.069
It's my weeding night,
and I planned

00:26.156 --> 00:28.463
on losing my virginity again.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.074
Duly noted.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.642
Now, I know its kind of cliche
but I was thinking

00:33.729 --> 00:36.949
honeymooning in Paris
could be really romantic.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.387
Paris, France?

00:39.474 --> 00:41.867
No, Mike, Paris, Tennessee.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.217
You jest

00:43.304 --> 00:44.870
but it does have
a mini Eiffel Tower

00:44.957 --> 00:47.482
and is home to the world's
largest fish fry.

00:49.223 --> 00:52.052
Why did I ever buy you
that "Eating Atlas of America"?

00:52.139 --> 00:54.402
It's the best Christmas present
I ever got.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.969
It's my bible and my wish book.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.755
And the most dog-eared piece
of literature in the bathroom

00:59.842 --> 01:03.063
but I was thinking more
of the European Paris.

01:03.150 --> 01:06.022
Springtime, we're sitting
at a sidewalk cafe

01:06.109 --> 01:08.155
sipping little cups
of chocolate..

01:08.242 --> 01:10.896
Hey, if it's chocolate
you're cravin'

01:10.983 --> 01:13.551
we should just go to
the belly of the beast.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.423
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

01:15.510 --> 01:18.469
It's an entire city dedicated
to the magical cocoa bean.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.733
Very tempting, but, uh..

01:21.820 --> 01:25.302
Paris has history
and the amazing museums

01:25.389 --> 01:26.999
and beautiful architecture.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.958
You know what
you just described?

01:29.045 --> 01:30.264
Cleveland, Ohio.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.050
They got the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame there

01:34.137 --> 01:36.008
and it's shaped like
a big guitar.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.575
Good to know.

01:37.662 --> 01:40.839
That's history, architecture
and museum combined.

01:40.926 --> 01:44.452
It's the Jell-O 1-2-3
of vacation spots.

01:44.539 --> 01:47.846
All roads really do lead back
to food for you, don't they?

01:49.326 --> 01:50.588
I just want to go
somewhere special.

01:50.675 --> 01:53.156
Then how about
driving to Missouri

01:53.243 --> 01:55.071
and taking an old-timey
paddleboat ride

01:55.158 --> 01:56.725
down the mighty Mississippi?

01:56.812 --> 01:58.857
Sure, and when we
drop anchor in Saint Louie

01:58.944 --> 02:01.338
maybe we can go get a big old
bucket of Ozark puddin'.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.124
How'd you know
about Ozark puddin'?

02:04.211 --> 02:07.953
- Ah, I read.
- Vince, drop it!

02:08.040 --> 02:10.826
I told you, he's an old friend,
and we're having dinner!

02:10.913 --> 02:12.697
Not just any old friend,
an old boyfriend!

02:12.784 --> 02:16.179
Ugh, will you explain to this
lunkhead that a woman is capable

02:16.266 --> 02:19.095
of being just friends
with an old, former lover?

02:19.182 --> 02:21.750
Hey, if it didn't end with
name calling and tire slashing

02:21.837 --> 02:24.753
then the embers of desire
are still smoldering.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.364
Actually, Vince, I'm friends
with almost all my exes.

02:27.451 --> 02:30.062
Yeah, but they were all swishes.
How'd you put it, Mike?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.588
Like the front row
of a Cher concert?

02:33.675 --> 02:37.113
I never used the word swish,
I said pansy.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.638
Mom, who are you
meeting, anyway?

02:40.725 --> 02:43.554
- Remember Richard?
- Ooh, Richard. Wow.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.513
What does that mean,
"Ooh, Richard. Wow?"

02:45.600 --> 02:47.167
Nothing.

02:47.254 --> 02:50.779
I forbid you to go out
with "Ooh, Richard. Wow!"

02:50.866 --> 02:52.694
Oh, you forbid me?

02:52.781 --> 02:55.000
Well, that changes everything.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.264
Don't wait up!

02:57.351 --> 02:58.656
Okay, you can go

02:58.743 --> 03:00.528
but I want you
back here by 10 o'clock.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.443
And your panties better
not be in your purse!

03:02.530 --> 03:04.053
Don't be such an ass!

03:04.140 --> 03:06.055
'You know I never wear
panties with this dress.'

03:07.752 --> 03:09.319
Story of my life.

03:09.406 --> 03:12.670
I give a woman my heart,
and she says, "No thanks.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.629
Balls, please."

03:16.065 --> 03:19.373
- Mike, say something.
- Oh, sure.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.852
Vince, when somebody says
the word chocolate

03:20.939 --> 03:23.551
what city springs to mind?

03:23.638 --> 03:28.991
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

03:29.078 --> 03:31.515
♪ I see love ♪♪

03:43.092 --> 03:44.572
She expects me
to believe that

03:44.659 --> 03:46.661
some old boyfriend
calls her up out of the blue

03:46.748 --> 03:48.532
and just wants
to take her to dinner.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.099
Who the hell does that?

03:50.186 --> 03:52.536
Well, Vince, human behavior
has changed a lot

03:52.623 --> 03:55.235
since you slithered out
of the ocean and lost your tail.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.499
I don't even know
what that means.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.936
- Was that a shot?
- Yes, it was.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.851
It's not a big deal.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.027
Mom and Richard dated
a long time ago.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.638
He was a pilot, she was working
as a flight attendant.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.424
I know what goes on
between pilots and stews.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.861
I've seen more than
my share of pornography.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.819
Ugh.

04:14.906 --> 04:18.997
He's not wrong. It is one
of the more popular storylines.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.739
Which I don't watch.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.307
I'll bet at this very minute,
she's helping that jet jockey

04:24.394 --> 04:26.527
into his full
and upright position.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.355
Vince, you're talking
about my mother.

04:28.442 --> 04:31.314
You're right. Not for your ears.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.752
Her mother's
a sexual volcano. Insatiable.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.886
- I can still hear you.
- Apologies.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.327
One time,
we were at the Olive Garden

04:44.414 --> 04:46.764
and she took her shoe off
under the table.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.157
Get him out of here.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.724
Vince, let's go grab a beer.

04:49.811 --> 04:50.942
And I don't know how she does it

04:51.029 --> 04:52.509
but her big toe
and second toe

04:52.596 --> 04:54.555
can form an almost
perfect circle.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.514
If I didn't know any better,
I'd swear it was my own hand.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.608
I should have locked
Joyce in her closet

05:04.695 --> 05:08.525
and then met that guy at
the restaurant, swingin' a rake.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.092
You know,
that's technically kidnapping

05:10.179 --> 05:11.398
and assault
with a deadly weapon.

05:11.485 --> 05:12.964
Oh, what are you
gonna be tonight?

05:13.051 --> 05:15.053
A cop or a friend?

05:15.140 --> 05:17.099
I'm kinda feeling
the need to be both.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.970
Look, when you're in
a relationship you can't just

05:19.057 --> 05:21.146
forbid the other person
from doing stuff.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.887
Otherwise, it's guaranteed
they're gonna do it.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.062
That's just human nature.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.760
What the hell
are you talking about?

05:25.847 --> 05:28.153
Threats and ultimatums
are the glue of love.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.112
Without it, we're no better
than animals.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.856
In my experience, you have
to have give and take.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.901
Like this whole honeymoon
thing with me and Molly.

05:36.988 --> 05:38.903
She wants to go to Paris
and I don't.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.558
What do you got against Paris?
It's beautiful.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.604
Plus, if you can stomach
pit hair on chicks

05:43.691 --> 05:45.562
you can see
free boobs on TV.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.349
You should be a travel agent.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.787
But I'm still not gonna
risk my life flying

05:52.874 --> 05:55.050
half way across the world
just to see free boobs.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.965
That's where you and I differ.

05:57.052 --> 05:59.620
I'd fly to Bangladesh
to see a pair of knockers.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.363
So what's the problem?
You afraid of flying?

06:03.450 --> 06:06.453
No, but when I'm traveling I
like knowing if there's trouble

06:06.540 --> 06:08.759
I can jump out of a window
without plummeting to my death.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.632
Can you imagine
the size crater you'd make?

06:11.719 --> 06:13.764
Tourists could ride mules
to the bottom.

06:18.029 --> 06:21.729
What I'm saying is,
I can't just say to Molly

06:21.816 --> 06:23.208
we're not going to Paris

06:23.295 --> 06:26.429
because then we'd definitely
be going to Paris.

06:26.516 --> 06:29.606
So you're telling me if I don't
want Joyce to bang that guy

06:29.693 --> 06:32.435
I should say,
hey, Joyce, go bang that guy.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.352
No, that's not even close
to what I'm saying.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.963
Then make your point and stop
dancing around the subject

06:39.050 --> 06:40.922
like some kind of woman.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.665
Look, if you really care
about Joyce

06:44.752 --> 06:46.362
maybe try using
a gentler approach.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.320
Less shouting, more listening.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.670
You mean, like..

06:49.757 --> 06:53.456
"Joyce, love of my life,
answer to my prayers

06:53.543 --> 06:56.241
"if I find out
you're banging that flyboy

06:56.328 --> 06:58.243
I'll kill all three of us."

07:01.159 --> 07:03.161
You know, I think this is why
we don't hang out more.

07:07.905 --> 07:11.735
So did you and Mike figure out
a honeymoon spot yet?

07:11.822 --> 07:14.259
Well, I'm still hoping
for a pied-a-terre in Paris

07:14.346 --> 07:18.176
but he's still pushing for
a pop up camper in the backyard.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.656
I would say try
and meet in the middle

07:19.743 --> 07:22.877
but I can't imagine
where that would be.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.966
I'm starting to think
he's not too keen on flying.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.795
Every time I bring it up,
he turns all pale and clammy.

07:27.882 --> 07:31.451
He gets the same way when I ask
who ate all my Chips Ahoy.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.018
Yeah, pale and clammy
is kind of his tell.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.630
- Mine's whistling.
- You are a nervous whistler.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.809
Hey, what if you cured his fear
of flying with hypnosis?

07:41.896 --> 07:43.375
And while he's under

07:43.463 --> 07:45.595
tell him my cookies
are actually rattlesnakes.

07:48.816 --> 07:53.168
Hey. There she is. And home by
10:30. How was your date?

07:53.255 --> 07:55.126
What are you talking about?
It wasn't a date!

07:55.213 --> 07:58.478
- It was dinner. Nothing more.
- Sorry.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.523
You know, every time you go out
to dinner, is it a date?

08:00.610 --> 08:02.612
Yes, but not with every date
do I get dinner.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.790
Yeah, well,
this was just dinner.

08:06.877 --> 08:09.358
We ate, we caught up,
I got the hell out of there.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.142
Okay, fine.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.970
Why don't you worry
about your own lives?

08:13.057 --> 08:15.538
God, two grown women
with nothing better to do

08:15.625 --> 08:18.628
than gossip about their mother
while sucking down her wine!

08:20.369 --> 08:22.197
Wow, what's up with her?

08:22.284 --> 08:23.720
Hard to say.

08:23.807 --> 08:24.895
Having dinner
with an old boyfriend

08:24.982 --> 08:27.463
can be very emotional.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.813
Especially when they slide
an STD pamphlet

08:29.900 --> 08:31.772
across the table.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.731
[instrumental music]

08:37.081 --> 08:39.997
- Morning.
- Morning, sweetheart.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.608
You want some breakfast?

08:41.695 --> 08:43.348
No. I don't wanna
put you out.

08:43.435 --> 08:46.003
Besides, I'm pretty sure
those are your eggs.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.136
Oh, that.

08:48.223 --> 08:51.400
Well, you know, how nasty
I get when I drink rum.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.011
I'm like a pirate that way.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.274
Except louder, meaner,
and no parrot.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.410
I apologize.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.368
Now, let mommy
make you an omelet?

09:04.935 --> 09:07.068
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.552
Look, I'm not trying
to pry or anything

09:12.639 --> 09:15.380
but did everything go alright
with you and Richard last night?

09:15.467 --> 09:17.687
What are you implying?

09:17.774 --> 09:19.341
Nothing, I'm just
worried about you.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.865
When the hell are you gonna get
your own house, anyway?

09:23.737 --> 09:25.782
I think I'll pass
on the omelet, Red Beard.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.697
Excuse me while
I go answer yourdoor.

09:27.784 --> 09:31.005
Yeah, damn right it's my door.
And it's my toilet!

09:31.092 --> 09:34.443
Tell your boyfriend other people
in this house have to poop too!

09:38.969 --> 09:40.231
Hey, Vince.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.277
Please excuse
my showing up unannounced.

09:42.364 --> 09:43.887
I just wanted
to stop by and give

09:43.974 --> 09:45.367
these flowers to your mother.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.890
I'll make sure she gets them.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.589
I got a friend in Little Armenia
who gives me a deal.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.548
That's why they smell like
grilled lamb and Drakkar Noir.

09:54.506 --> 09:57.118
What are you doing here?
Come to check up on me?

09:57.205 --> 09:59.163
Golly, no.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.948
I suppose you wanna know
what time I got home.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.428
No, I do not.
I trust you implicitly.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.561
- 3:00 a.m.
- What are you talking about?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.432
Your car pulled
in the driveway at 10:30

10:07.519 --> 10:10.392
and you were
lights out by 11:15.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.960
- You were spyin' on me?
- No!

10:13.047 --> 10:15.658
I gave the old lady across
the street 20 bucks to do it.

10:15.745 --> 10:18.400
She's got her own
night-vision goggles.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.620
I can't live like this!

10:20.707 --> 10:23.187
If this ring
is a tracking device

10:23.274 --> 10:24.624
then I don't want it!

10:24.711 --> 10:26.451
- Mom.
- What's going on?

10:26.538 --> 10:30.194
Oh, everybody needs an update.
Here's the headline.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.936
I'm giving this sneaky little
weasel his walking papers!

10:33.023 --> 10:34.590
Mom, what has gotten into you?

10:34.677 --> 10:37.245
Nobody's gotten into me!

10:37.332 --> 10:41.728
Now, if Officer Cop-a-squat
is done warming my toilet seat

10:41.815 --> 10:44.731
I'd like to take a shower
and get on with my new life!

10:46.689 --> 10:47.777
I lit a candle.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.920
[Joyce]
'Hey, you snoopy old witch!
You wanna spy on me?'

11:00.007 --> 11:01.878
'Spy on this!'

11:03.227 --> 11:06.404
God, I hope it's
just her ass.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.842
I hate to say it,
but if this behavior continues

11:08.929 --> 11:10.931
we should really consider
putting mom in a nursing home.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.933
Victoria.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.805
I'm talking about a nice one,
with activities and a pool.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.328
That way, when we visit her
in the summer

11:17.415 --> 11:19.591
we can lay out and tan.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.811
Actually, I was thinking we
could just take her out tonight

11:21.898 --> 11:23.944
have a few drinks,
see what's going on.

11:24.031 --> 11:27.730
Smart, get her drunk so she'll
sign the power of attorney

11:27.817 --> 11:30.602
papers and climb to the back of
the senior shuttle on her own.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.259
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.089
Your mom and Vince
make up yet?

11:39.176 --> 11:41.048
No, she called him
and told him to come and pick up

11:41.135 --> 11:44.268
his kimono and boner pills.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.750
Ugh, you see that combination
coming down the stairs one time

11:47.837 --> 11:50.187
you'll be seeing it
in your dreams.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.537
Again, thanks
for covering my eyes.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.803
It's too bad he and your mom
can't work this out.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.500
Well, communication's the key.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.589
That's the only way
a relationship can survive.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.460
Couldn't have
put it better myself.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.506
You know, if there's ever
anything bothering you

12:04.593 --> 12:06.421
you can always tell me.

12:06.508 --> 12:09.511
Insecurities, phobias, whatever.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.252
Good to know.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.820
I'm only asking 'cause I'm
starting to think the idea

12:13.907 --> 12:16.518
of flying somewhere on
our honeymoon is spooking you.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.955
Spooking me?
I'm a Chicago police officer.

12:19.042 --> 12:22.480
We're known far and wide
as the unspookables.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.655
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna lay down.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.961
I'm feeling a little woozy.

12:28.573 --> 12:31.402
I don't think
you're going to Paris.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.622
Not unless I can get
big clammy in a kayak.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.986
This is fun.

12:50.073 --> 12:53.033
Three Flynn gals out
for a night on the town.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.904
Why don't we do
this more often?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.688
Because it's cheaper
to get drunk at home

12:56.776 --> 12:59.300
and mom can take
her pants off.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.302
Hey, hey,
did you hear that, mom?

13:01.389 --> 13:03.913
Yeah, I heard it.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.829
- Sorry about you and Vince.
- Me too.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.526
- Thanks.
- You doing okay?

13:08.613 --> 13:10.267
Yep.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.704
Just wanna have a quiet drink
and not talk about it.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.054
Fine by me.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.625
So here's a funny thing.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.106
Uh, Mike, the big lug

13:23.193 --> 13:25.805
is completely panic-stricken
to get on an airplane.

13:25.892 --> 13:29.373
- Oh, my God, what have I done?
- Mom, it's okay.

13:29.460 --> 13:33.421
- I'm a terrible person!
- No, you're not.

13:33.508 --> 13:36.467
Being engaged to one guy
and sleeping with another guy

13:36.554 --> 13:38.295
doesn't make you
a terrible person

13:38.382 --> 13:41.864
it just makes you
a slutty person.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.344
What are you talkin' about?

13:43.431 --> 13:46.651
I...I didn't sleep with Richard.

13:46.738 --> 13:49.611
He wanted me to,
but I told him I was engaged.

13:49.698 --> 13:53.180
- So wait, nothing happened?
- I kissed him, okay?

13:53.267 --> 13:54.398
[gasps]

13:54.485 --> 13:55.791
On the winky?

13:57.575 --> 14:00.796
What? No, not on the winky!

14:00.883 --> 14:02.842
What kind of woman do you think
your mother is?

14:02.929 --> 14:05.714
Sorry, I just assumed
it was hereditary.

14:09.239 --> 14:13.026
So that's it?
Just a kiss? Nothing else?

14:13.113 --> 14:15.680
Okay. You want all
the dirty details?

14:15.767 --> 14:17.639
- Absolutely.
- Sure.

14:18.988 --> 14:22.035
We kissed,
there was a little tongue

14:22.122 --> 14:23.993
and maybe a few seconds

14:24.080 --> 14:26.169
of over the sweater
"Good morning, Tokyo."

14:28.737 --> 14:32.001
I don't know what that is.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.786
Old men like to fiddle with
your boobs like it's a radio.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.055
That's more disturbing
than cheating.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.057
Yeah, I never count
over the sweater.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.711
You never count under the skirt.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.844
Hand, no. Head, yes.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.196
The point is,
I kissed another man

14:53.283 --> 14:55.633
so I got no business
being engaged to Vince.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.766
More to the point,
you stopped kissing another man

14:57.853 --> 14:59.115
because you're engaged to Vince.

14:59.202 --> 15:01.639
Yeah, that makes you
practically Superwoman.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.338
Once I got a fella's tongue
in my mouth, it's on till dawn.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.907
I did stop myself, didn't I?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.387
Of course, his comb over
and man girdle

15:10.474 --> 15:12.346
helped influence my decision.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.217
Well, whatever it takes.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.436
But you did the right thing

15:15.523 --> 15:18.221
you should be proud of yourself.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.484
I guess the thing to do now
is to tell Vince.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.138
- Uh, no! No!
- No!

15:22.225 --> 15:24.184
You out of your mind?
You take that to your grave.

15:24.271 --> 15:27.622
Keep talking crazy like that,
we're gonna put you in a home.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.580
A nice one with a pool.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.716
You know, I don't understand
what you're so afraid of.

15:34.803 --> 15:37.414
Air travel is the safest form
of transportation.

15:37.501 --> 15:40.156
And I don't understand why you
flap your arms and scream like

15:40.243 --> 15:41.810
a little girl
when you see a spider

15:41.897 --> 15:44.769
the size of a pinto bean.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.424
Oh, I love Carl's
itsy bitsy spider dance.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.646
For your information, flapping
your arms and making loud noises

15:51.733 --> 15:53.256
is how you scare
those nasty bastards away.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.258
You are thinking
of grizzly bears.

15:55.345 --> 15:58.870
Spiders you just flick off
the table or casually step on.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.655
That doesn't always work.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.178
They'll hide in the crevice
of your shoe crawl up

16:02.265 --> 16:04.093
your pant leg
and lay eggs in your ear.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.446
I'd rather have
a tarantula hotel in my head

16:09.533 --> 16:12.710
than be hurled through the air
in chitty chitty, crash crash.

16:14.234 --> 16:17.019
My big fear is nuns and clowns.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.761
And one time I saw a clown
dressed as a nun.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.719
Nearly soiled my dashiki.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.854
Oh, man, a clown
dressed as a nun?

16:25.941 --> 16:27.290
That's like a fever dream.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.336
More like a wrong turn
on gay pride day.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.384
And if you add hot pants and
roller skates to that picture

16:34.471 --> 16:36.647
you will sleep with the lights
on for the rest of your life.

16:38.954 --> 16:42.088
Alright, nothing left
to remember me by

16:42.175 --> 16:44.829
but a hair dye stain
on her pillow and enough DNA

16:44.916 --> 16:47.223
on the bedspread to clone
an army of Morantos.

16:49.486 --> 16:52.489
Well, uh, best of luck, Vince.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.230
I'm really gonna
miss you around here.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.450
I guess this means I won't
be attending your wedding.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.061
But at least one of us
will get to stick

16:59.148 --> 17:01.020
his flag in a Flynn girl.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.414
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

17:04.501 --> 17:08.157
No more words!
Just hold me, you big bastard!

17:10.855 --> 17:14.120
- Oh, Vince, you're still here.
- On my way out.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.557
And once you spray a little Zout
on the pillowcase

17:16.644 --> 17:18.515
I am but a distant memory.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.562
I got something
I need to tell you

17:21.649 --> 17:22.998
and I'm not gonna
feel right until I do.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.000
- Mom.
- What are you doing?

17:25.087 --> 17:26.784
Just being honest with the man.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.525
Let me have it.

17:28.612 --> 17:32.138
I care about you very much,
and I never wanna hurt you.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.182
Where are you
going with this?

17:33.269 --> 17:35.793
- I got it.
- Okay.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.534
You deserve
to know the truth.

17:37.621 --> 17:38.709
And I can't go on
living with this.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.276
- Mom..
- Shh!

17:40.363 --> 17:42.235
Vincent Moranto..

17:44.106 --> 17:46.456
...I want you to come
live with me.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.111
[together]
What?

17:49.198 --> 17:50.634
We're engaged!

17:50.721 --> 17:53.811
There's absolutely no one else
I'm interested in.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.422
Plus your waterbed
makes me nauseous.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.119
Hey, in '88,
that was top of the line.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.903
Cost me 600 bucks.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.296
Yeah, well,
it makes my ass sweat

18:00.383 --> 18:02.603
and it smells like
grilled lamb.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.865
Why didn't you tell me
you hated it?

18:03.952 --> 18:05.040
We shouldn't have secrets.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.433
What else aren't
you telling me?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.391
- That's it.
- Nothing. Nothing.

18:10.001 --> 18:12.830
Why don't we go upstairs
and unpack your things.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.789
Whatever you say, my angel.

18:16.704 --> 18:17.835
Clean up after you're done.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.794
I don't like
wakin' up to a mess.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.540
You wanna tell me what
really went on with your mom?

18:26.627 --> 18:27.932
Yeah, you heard her.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.934
She wants him to live here.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.111
And we think it's great.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.982
- Mm-hmm.
- We do?

18:34.069 --> 18:35.984
- Yeah, we do.
- Hmm.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.121
[whistling]

18:59.529 --> 19:02.097
Listen, I think we need
to talk about our honeymoon.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.620
Okay. What are you thinking?

19:03.707 --> 19:07.189
A dude ranch where
we cook our own cow?

19:07.276 --> 19:11.672
No. Although, Wilbur, Wyoming
is a beautiful slice of heaven.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.500
Mike, I don't care
where we go.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.851
Only thing I care about
is that we're together.

19:16.938 --> 19:21.247
Well, I've heard Paris
is lovely in the springtime.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.033
Paris...France?

19:26.861 --> 19:29.124
- You know we can't drive there.
- I know.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.909
- It's a pretty long flight.
- I get it.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.825
In an airplane.

19:34.912 --> 19:38.612
Stop talking about it. I feel
like I got spiders in my ears.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.962
Aw, baby, you're the greatest.

19:43.747 --> 19:44.879
Kimono boner!

19:47.403 --> 19:49.275
Listen, I'm making
sardines on toast.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.319
- Any takers?
- No.

19:50.406 --> 19:51.581
We're good!

19:56.412 --> 19:57.848
Maybe we should
keep that Paris money

19:57.935 --> 19:59.894
and start saving
for a place of our own.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.852
Or at least buy
him a longer robe.

20:08.511 --> 20:09.730
[theme music]
