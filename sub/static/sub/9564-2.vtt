18:28.920 --> 18:31.388
no more voices going,
''Ba ba ba ba ba,''

18:31.480 --> 18:36.190
no more voices whispering,
you know, ''Ba-ba...''

18:36.280 --> 18:38.589

18:38.680 --> 18:41.513
Spit it out Madison.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.710
This kid asks me for credit terms

The onIy thing that I ask...

19:08.200 --> 19:10.350
is repayment...

19:10.440 --> 19:13.910
in a cIearIy defined scheduIe.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.355
So I give him what he wants.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.793
What did he want?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.757
Goods and services...

19:23.360 --> 19:28.992
This deceiving, scheming
IittIe pIuke!

19:29.080 --> 19:31.230
He thinks...

19:31.320 --> 19:35.757
that he can get away
with cheating me out of my money...

19:35.840 --> 19:39.753
Maybe he wasn't trying
to cheat you, Madison.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.034
Oh, yeah?

19:41.120 --> 19:43.190
It's a misunderstanding.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.632
ReaIIy?

19:48.400 --> 19:50.960
We need you to work on this,
Madison.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.195
Shit!

30:21.280 --> 30:25.478
Oh! Sid.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.120
Hi. Sorry, Angie.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.714
You shouIdn't go into
the staff showers, Sid.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.792
I know, I know.
It was a crisis.

30:33.880 --> 30:37.839
WeII, it's just a bit
embarrassing that's aII.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.593
ActuaIIy, I'm pretty
confident about my body...

30:40.680 --> 30:43.990
No, I'm having a crisis.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.513
Oh.

30:45.600 --> 30:52.039
WeII, sometimes aduIt bodies can be
a IittIe overwheIming.

30:52.120 --> 30:55.237
Oh, for Christ's sake, Angie,
I don't care about your tits!

30:57.680 --> 30:58.999
Oh.

30:59.080 --> 31:03.119
I'm in deep, deep, deep shit.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.036
Right.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.156
OK.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.958
You need advice?

31:11.040 --> 31:14.555
I need advice and 300 quid.

31:14.640 --> 31:18.030
Otherwise someone's going to
be re-possessing my boIIocks.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.915
OK, weII Iook, when it comes to debt,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.231
the best thing to do is to face up
to it before it gets out of hand.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.309
Yeah?

31:26.400 --> 31:29.756
Yeah. AII you have to do is go
to the person you owe money to

31:29.840 --> 31:33.116
and caImIy ask them to
rescheduIe the payments.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.998
RescheduIe payments?
So that's one baII now

31:36.080 --> 31:38.116

31:38.200 --> 31:42.034
BeIieve me, Sid,
I'm a responsibIe aduIt.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.350
I know. OK?

31:44.440 --> 31:46.874
Now what was it,
a phone or something?

31:46.960 --> 31:51.988
ActuaIIy, Angie, it was three
ounces of prime hydroponic skunk.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.672
Shit!

31:54.760 --> 31:56.671
Yeah, shit.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.872
Go to the poIice.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.190
They'II arrest me.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.349
Give it back.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.953
I Iost it in the harbour.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.712
Keep your head down.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.633
He's got my student ID card.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.314
Right.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.198
Right. OK.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.953
BasicaIIy, I'm fucked, aren't I?

32:18.040 --> 32:19.792
Yep.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.679
