<i>Abbey, can you hear me?</i>

04:20.009 --> 04:20.843
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Okay.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.974
<i>I sure do.</i>

04:30.228 --> 04:33.106
-We did have a nice little smooch--
<i>-Interesting, Abbey.</i>

04:33.189 --> 04:35.566
<i>You didn't tell me right after?</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:46.911
<i>I feel like you need to, like, chat.</i>

04:46.995 --> 04:48.871
<i>Maybe, like, try and have</i>
<i>a nice little chat.</i>

04:50.581 --> 04:53.626
<i>After your last relationship…</i>

04:56.004 --> 04:57.088
<i>Your marriage.</i>

05:01.509 --> 05:03.511
<i>-A little casual thing.</i>
-No big deal.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.804
<i>No, I just feel like…</i>

05:04.887 --> 05:07.432
<i>I don't know. You've just gone</i>
<i>through so much. It's not…</i>

05:07.515 --> 05:10.476
<i>I feel like not everything</i>
<i>needs to be a big deal.</i>

05:11.519 --> 05:12.520
<i>In that sense.</i>

05:12.603 --> 05:14.731
<i>And I just think it could be fun.</i>

05:35.668 --> 05:37.337
<i>You have your super important interview.</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:38.629
<i>You're going to do great.</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:43.676
<i>-Let me know how it goes.</i>
-Be safe.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.429
<i>-I love you very much. Bye.</i>
-Okay. Bye.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.667
-I got sugar. I got stevia--
-Who said that was my cup of tea?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.044
-Is it that obvious?
-Yes.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.504
That I think he's kinda cute.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.957
I left my glasses on.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.432
A possum jumped on me.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.476
Girl! No, you let the spider fucking in.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.146
-Oh, my God.
-Is that a spider?

10:05.229 --> 10:06.606
Help!

16:21.105 --> 16:23.273
I don't want, like, Titanic to happen.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.789
Too crazy for right now?
Yeah, we're not even drunk yet.

26:54.612 --> 26:57.198
-We never went on a date again.
-Can we get two mole tacos?

38:25.761 --> 38:28.347
My dream is to

38:28.431 --> 38:29.932
become the president of America.

38:32.852 --> 38:33.978
It's not gonna happen.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.229
I was born here.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.148
It's not the race thing, dummy.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.738
Call me stupid one more time.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.494
I think you probably come across
a little ditsy too.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.372
Yeah, just say smarter things.

39:00.296 --> 39:01.255
How you feeling?

39:02.089 --> 39:03.007
You get on my nerves.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.051
I mean, we are so cute.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.010
Fuck off.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.526
Do you wanna go in there?

39:23.194 --> 39:24.153
Why you do this to me?

39:24.236 --> 39:25.571
I'm not doing anything.

39:25.654 --> 39:27.615
I'm literally just standing here.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.909
All right, come on.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.259
Don't look at me with those eyes.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.636
I'm not doing anything.

40:13.786 --> 40:14.620
Hi.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.163
You're so soft.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.919
Fuck. Don't break my bed.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.296
For real.
