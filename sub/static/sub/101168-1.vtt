WEBVTT

01:12.072 --> 01:13.072
Neelyn: God.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.034
Land.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.413
Oil.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.708
It's often said war is waged
over just these three.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.793
Yet, if war is fought over land...

01:37.347 --> 01:41.386
That land usually has something to do
with god, or oil.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.893
I didn't come here
to West Virginia for god.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.735
Big James: That thing was bullshit.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.483
It was just bollocks.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.607
It's a fucking fairy tale.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.493
Neelyn: So here we are...

02:03.248 --> 02:05.409
With suitcases full of dirty cash.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.615
Big James: And what then?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.866
Neelyn: Invested in
a petrol operation.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.922
Big James: For blokes like us
in a legit world.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.751
Neelyn: Big James isn't a fan
of the new deal

02:13.842 --> 02:15.958
and he's kept that no secret
back in London.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.386
Stewardess: The pilot
has informed me that

02:19.473 --> 02:20.963
we'll be landing in just a moment.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.423
Fiona: Hey, you all right?

02:24.728 --> 02:25.888
What's wrong?

02:29.650 --> 02:30.856
You all right, big James?

02:31.777 --> 02:33.483
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.100
Hey, why didn't Suzie come along?

02:36.907 --> 02:38.989
You know, I didn't get the note.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.700
Fiona: From who? Harris? Yeah.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.242
On.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.947
Neelyn: He's bad-mouthed a deal
and Harris knows it.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.327
A smart fella doesn't cross Harris.

02:51.672 --> 02:55.381
'Cause back in London,
Harris is the top man.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.903
Pilot on pa: Time to finish
those drinks.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.133
We'll be on the ground...

02:58.220 --> 03:01.758
Neelyn: Sure, sitting on
the king's throne has its perks.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.493
Pilot: Way down to West Virginia.
Harris: Mmm.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.927
Neelyn: But it's lonely at the top.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.597
Neelyn: But here,
deep in the hills of appalachia,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.140
Harris has a mate.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.353
An oil man.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.278
Preston.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.384
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Ll knew these had to be your friends.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.736
Ah, you know I got friends
all over the world.

03:25.831 --> 03:26.831
Hmm.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.810
Every ten, 20 years,
some actually come visit me.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.914
Oh, sure.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.788
Mike.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.831
Junior: It's from all the boys.
Mike: Cigars!

03:37.092 --> 03:38.207
Only the best.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.046
Agent, they're good boys
coming to see me.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.677
- Mmm-hmm.
- They're gonna invest in my operation.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.470
Lot of jobs, great for the economy.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.723
And hey, if I even sniff

03:47.811 --> 03:50.598
they know how to pronounce
Isis, al-qaeda and kgb,

03:50.689 --> 03:52.125
I'm gonna shoot 'em
in the face myself.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.935
Save uncle Sam all that time
and money.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.103
I know you will.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
Man: Now don't you worry.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.445
Preston: Excuse me.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.988
How's it going, fellas?

04:06.288 --> 04:07.528
I got some friends coming in.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.490
I'd like them to experience the peace
and Serenity of our beautiful home.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.129
You got some fucking balls on you,
old man.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.832
Well, that I do.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.629
That I do.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.011
I also got some brains.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.431
Educated. I read my history.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.136
Preston: This here shit
ripped our nation apart,

04:33.482 --> 04:36.474
until finally,
these cocksuckers just quit.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.396
You know?

04:40.197 --> 04:43.064
They gave up. They lost.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.453
Now, I don't give a shit
what your politics or your ideas are,

04:50.415 --> 04:51.905
but this here shit offends me,

04:53.001 --> 04:54.741
'cause I believe in winning
and losing.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.586
And a real man knows
how to do both with dignity.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.715
You wanna fly a flag?
Go win something.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.295
Riding around with this
just says, "hey, I'm a fucking loser."

05:10.977 --> 05:14.060
Some people might say
my life is in a rut

05:14.564 --> 05:17.351
but I'm quite happy with what I got

05:17.442 --> 05:18.522
doop!

05:21.988 --> 05:23.569
Harris: Ah, me old China!

05:23.657 --> 05:24.737
- Look at you!
- Harris: Ah!

05:24.908 --> 05:26.594
Preston: You're looking great.
You're looking healthy!

05:26.618 --> 05:28.028
Harris: Thank you, man.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.613
Give me a hug, man.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.702
Well, we're not getting
any younger, are we?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.030
Oh, you know, fine wines,

05:33.166 --> 05:34.906
fine wines.
We just get better with age.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.687
Harris: Well, you look
pretty good yourself.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.451
- My god.
- Harris: Yeah.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.520
Harris: Preston, I would like to
introduce you to the lovely Jackie.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.112
I didn't think it could get
much prettier here, but it just did.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.296
I'm junior, by the way.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.556
Fiona: It's pretty hot, babe. Yeah.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.526
- Junior: Help you down here.
- Oh, thank you.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.260
- Oh, jeez!
- Junior: I got you.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.686
- Junior: Oh!
- Sorry.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.229
- Easy. Easy.
- Thank you.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.897
You gotta watch out there. Yeah.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.420
- Last step is a doozy.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.839
Neelyn: Good to see you.
Harris: Fucking hell!

06:02.863 --> 06:04.649
Look at that. What is this?

06:06.783 --> 06:08.944
Harris: Mad Max
in the fucking thunderdome?

06:10.829 --> 06:13.912
Neelyn: 25 million quid
from the streets of London,

06:14.624 --> 06:16.706
now in the hills of appalachia.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.826
Preston needs cash flow.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.661
Harris needs a cleaner.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.589
Win-win, for most.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.303
Babel

06:28.555 --> 06:30.261
where are you going?

06:31.975 --> 06:33.886
I gotta sort a bit of
business out for Harris.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.429
Business? About what?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.435
About business, don't worry about it.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.390
All right, well, bye, babe.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.857
See you later, okay?

06:59.628 --> 07:02.335
And the boys all shout for tomorrow

07:36.831 --> 07:37.911
An oil deal.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.244
Here.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.954
Doesn't make sense.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.161
Cleans up our money.
Makes us legit.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.616
We had a good run, you and me.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.450
Yeah.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.005
I'm ready.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.785
Preston: I make a profit.
I mean, I always have.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.952
But these days,
I can't get a fucking loan,

09:07.672 --> 09:09.958
'cause wall street
just don't like my techniques.

09:12.802 --> 09:17.171
You know, one of the biggest crimes

09:18.641 --> 09:20.302
as Americans is that

09:22.479 --> 09:24.515
our righteous morality towards nature

09:24.647 --> 09:26.854
rarely extends beyond
our own backyard.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.398
I mean, we love to drive cars,
we love to fly in airplanes.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.355
I mean, we don't mind getting
that oil from foreign countries,

09:35.825 --> 09:37.986
but god help you
if you wanna drill right here at home.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.449
Well, I don't
ascribe to that philosophy.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.950
I believe you can drill
and do it right.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.042
I learned my trade right here
on this land you all standing on.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.341
I don't frac.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.634
I don't use bullshit chemicals.

10:02.685 --> 10:03.845
I treat this land with honor.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.641
And leave it like
god intended for it to be.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.274
Neelyn: Dirty cash from overseas

10:12.362 --> 10:14.774
laundered into a regional
West Virginia bank,

10:14.864 --> 10:17.196
extends one lawford oil llc

10:17.742 --> 10:19.778
a loan that will never be repaid.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.203
Meanwhile, Preston,
with sole power of attorney

10:23.289 --> 10:24.950
of another llc,

10:25.041 --> 10:26.827
gifts units to Harris.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.666
The paperwork means shit.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.869
The contract is in blood,

10:32.132 --> 10:34.293
in trust, in friendship.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.125
But this contract
is stronger than most.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.299
All because of the bond
between Preston and Harris.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.838
Shit!

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
What?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.139
I got a fucking loan.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.814
I got a fucking loan!

11:15.466 --> 11:17.582
I am pretty fastidious about my cars.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.920
I keep them pretty clean.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.545
Um, and, uh, I was giving
a ride to a friend the other day,

11:22.724 --> 11:24.305
and he's eating a sandwich in my car,

11:24.392 --> 11:25.928
and he just made a huge mess,

11:26.019 --> 11:27.759
which, I, you know,
I didn't say anything...

11:27.854 --> 11:30.721
Hey, buddy.
How are you doing, miss?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.810
You mind clearing out
so we can sit here?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.183
- Are you joking?
- Yes, I do.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.484
We're very comfortable here.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.190
Junior: Oh!

11:39.282 --> 11:40.442
â€œWoman: Don't.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.650
Man: Oh... junior: Stoney.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.947
Stoney: Come on. I'm sorry
about that. I'm sorry.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.075
Junior: Sorry, guys.
Stoney: We'll miss you.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.728
Band member: We guys are gonna
take a little break,

11:50.752 --> 11:52.117
so everybody stick around...

11:58.259 --> 11:59.874
Bet you I get with
one of them tonight.

12:00.845 --> 12:01.845
They're both taken.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.595
Junior: Taken? Yeah.

12:18.655 --> 12:22.193
Oh, come on now!

12:25.578 --> 12:27.443
You know what? Fuck me!

12:29.457 --> 12:31.322
I'm an oil man.

12:31.793 --> 12:32.793
Yeah.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.442
Fiona: Mmm.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.712
You're so much more.

12:40.134 --> 12:43.342
Baby... I love you.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.432
Come here.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.436
Neelyn: I got me dancing shoes on.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.848
Two shots please, darling.
Thank you.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.233
- Jackie: Oh.
- Got one for you.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.800
- All right.
- And one for me.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.192
And we're doing this together,
all right?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.318
- All right.
- Ready?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.616
- Yes.
- One, two, three.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.822
Jackie: Mmm. Junior: Whoo!

13:12.959 --> 13:15.496
Damn! Ah!

13:18.214 --> 13:19.249
It's all right, bud.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.686
You like when I howl like a wolf,
don't you?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.879
Yes. I love it.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.758
Neelyn: All right, gaffer?
Come on, son,

13:27.849 --> 13:28.889
where did it all go wrong?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.453
Harris: Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

13:30.727 --> 13:31.967
Are you coked up, mate?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.180
Fuck off!

13:33.271 --> 13:34.761
I don't touch the stuff.
Do I, babe?

13:34.897 --> 13:36.478
No. No.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.932
Oi, where's Jackie?

13:39.402 --> 13:40.482
Neelyn: She's fucked off.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.507
She's bored of listening
to all these gangster stories

13:43.531 --> 13:44.842
and drinking the Perrier.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.152
Yeah, well, you could use
a little Perrier yourself.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.528
Neelyn: Calm down.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.979
Hey, asshole, what's your problem?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.029
Hey, hey, hey!

13:57.670 --> 13:58.910
Hey! Boys!

13:59.505 --> 14:00.665
We don't do this here.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.048
Only you could get 86'd from a bar

14:07.138 --> 14:09.003
called the fucking 86!

14:09.307 --> 14:13.016
I mean, wild animals can't
get thrown out of that fucking place!

14:13.102 --> 14:15.388
You are a humiliation to us.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.391
You're a fucking embarrassment!

14:17.815 --> 14:20.397
Are you finished,
or shall I pull up a chair?

14:20.902 --> 14:23.063
You better wind your neck in, son,

14:23.654 --> 14:24.894
or I'll cut it off.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.983
Fi, get him out of here.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.802
Neelyn: Get him out of here!

14:28.826 --> 14:31.158
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.697
Fiona: Let's get you to bed, eh?

14:37.126 --> 14:40.835
How do women like you
get pulled into a racket like this?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.250
How's that?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.549
I mean, you...
You're sophisticated,

14:47.178 --> 14:49.043
you're smart.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.515
You got great style.

14:52.225 --> 14:56.184
Your... your beauty is so bright,
it hurts my eyes.

14:59.941 --> 15:00.941
Jackie: Mmm.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.685
I'm with him
because he pays me to be with him.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.860
Did not see that coming. Mmm.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.284
Aren't we innocent?

15:21.212 --> 15:22.952
I'm gonna fuck your brains out.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.181
Jackie: Come on now.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.865
Junior: Here we go.
Stoney: All right.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.465
Well, he did it.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.973
No, man, this is bad.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.641
- This is not...
- No, it ain't bad.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.719
It's good. Good for everything.

15:39.897 --> 15:40.897
It's all right.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.814
Hey, junior's junior.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.516
I'm gonna stop it.
I'm gonna stop it.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.896
Stoney: Mmm-mmm.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.152
Calm down, man.
Everything is all right.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.696
Man 1: Oh, man!

15:54.787 --> 15:56.747
Tomi: Uh, how much longer
are you guys gonna stay?

15:59.250 --> 16:00.650
Man 1: About, like, an hour, or so?

16:00.710 --> 16:01.870
Man 2: I guess another hour.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.534
What are we?

16:38.372 --> 16:39.407
What are you on about?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.450
I've been thinking and...

16:44.754 --> 16:47.666
I had some thoughts about...

16:47.757 --> 16:49.668
It's all right, love,
it's been a big day.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.675
I mean, six years,
what are we doing?

17:01.395 --> 17:02.706
Neelyn: Oh, for fuck's sake,
love, please.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.345
Fiona: But baby I just think that,

17:06.358 --> 17:07.973
I just think that, you know, if we...

17:08.861 --> 17:10.271
We made some changes, we'd just...

17:11.405 --> 17:12.405
Be happier.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.896
Know what I mean?

17:21.540 --> 17:22.656
Oh, baby, don't do that.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.662
Then you'll just blackout.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.334
Don't want you to blackout.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.674
Oh, hello.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.639
I was wondering where you were.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.851
Everything all right?

18:05.668 --> 18:06.668
Cheers.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.711
What are you doing out here?

18:14.051 --> 18:15.416
Can't sleep.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.549
Where's your man?

18:20.141 --> 18:21.141
He's...

18:24.145 --> 18:25.180
He's passed out.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.307
Ouch.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.809
Yeah.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.981
You wanna grab a drink?

18:38.034 --> 18:40.992
No. I... no, I can't.

18:41.912 --> 18:42.947
Why not?

18:43.998 --> 18:46.239
Well, he's... he's asleep.

18:47.752 --> 18:48.832
Well, that's his loss.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.386
The night is young.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.549
I'm good.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.966
All right.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.559
You know, it's still kickin' in there.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.581
One or two drinks,
you'll sleep like a baby.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.275
It's your call.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.038
All right.

19:35.841 --> 19:36.841
One drink.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.298
One drink.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.807
Fi?

19:53.234 --> 19:54.394
All right!

19:56.737 --> 19:57.772
Fi?

20:01.701 --> 20:02.941
What are you doing?

20:03.619 --> 20:04.734
I mean, come on!

20:04.829 --> 20:07.662
We've got an important meeting
in London tomorrow early,

20:07.748 --> 20:09.989
where it's already Sunday evening.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.166
Now, come on.
Get in the fucking shower

20:12.294 --> 20:14.330
and make
yourself presentable. Come on!

20:14.880 --> 20:15.915
Wheels up in an hour.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.169
Harris: What are you doing, son?

20:26.392 --> 20:27.973
Fiona's missing. I gotta find her.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.056
I need you in London.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.687
I'm not leaving till I find her, boss.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.771
Man: Harris!
Are we fucking going or not?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.106
Shut it!

20:45.661 --> 20:47.526
Give me that. Fuck!

20:49.749 --> 20:53.162
All right!
Let's get this show on the road here!

21:10.144 --> 21:11.224
Were you on last night?

21:13.063 --> 21:15.395
Tomi: Yeah, I'm always on.
I own the place.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.145
I'm looking for my girlfriend.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.568
English girl, Fiona.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.025
She's missing.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.159
Look, I'm...

21:30.706 --> 21:32.196
Sorry about last night.

21:35.586 --> 21:36.996
Don't remember much.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.834
She was sitting right there
till close...

21:46.388 --> 21:48.344
With Preston lawford's boy.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.349
Did they leave together?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.143
I don't talk about
what people do after last call.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.151
Neelyn: Please.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.650
They were laughing
and drinking and having a good time.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.588
- The fuck is that?
- It's milk and bourbon.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.177
It's my dad's old technique.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.810
It'll slow you down.
Easy on your stomach.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.559
Trust me.

22:46.574 --> 22:47.654
Not bad.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.993
Did they leave together?

22:59.169 --> 23:00.409
Yes.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.297
The oil boys.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.501
They're drilling down south
of Buckley.

23:11.849 --> 23:12.884
How far is that?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.550
It's a few hours, deep in the hills,

23:16.812 --> 23:17.927
past the big ugly.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.686
The big ugly?

23:24.820 --> 23:27.857
These were found in the ladies room.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.110
My phone and wallet.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.497
Thanks.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.501
Voicemail notification:
Sunday, 2:53 A.M.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.921
Fiona: Neelyn! Neelyn!
Pick up the phone!

23:46.008 --> 23:48.374
I'm lost! I don't know where I am.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.280
I don't know where...

23:50.304 --> 23:52.090
Man: Come here!

23:53.807 --> 23:54.967
Man: Hey!

24:14.411 --> 24:16.151
My dad died two years back.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.939
He had a big heart.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.089
He lived hard.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.044
His truck's out back.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.387
I'd like it gone.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.021
There's, uh, clothes in there.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.271
I'm sure something will fit.
You should blend in.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.520
At least let me pay you for it.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.656
Just take care of yourself.

25:01.959 --> 25:02.959
Thank you.

27:08.127 --> 27:12.461
You love her but she loves him

27:13.173 --> 27:15.539
and he loves somebody else

27:15.592 --> 27:17.423
you just can't win

27:18.720 --> 27:23.714
and so it goes
'til the day you die

27:24.143 --> 27:25.849
this thing they call love...

27:27.604 --> 27:28.764
There she is.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.222
Kara: How was owingsville?
Junior: Fantastic.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.229
Met with some financiers.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.110
Keeps the job site up and running.
Keeps me here.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.113
Well, I guess
that's good news for some.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.992
So you kept out of trouble as usual?

27:45.122 --> 27:46.162
Junior: Yeah, you know me.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.576
Everybody's trying to get a piece.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.203
Yeah.

27:51.795 --> 27:52.835
What time you getting off?

27:55.549 --> 27:58.461
Pj, I'm kinda seeing somebody.

27:58.552 --> 27:59.912
What's your man got to do with me?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.221
Seems like you two need to talk.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.211
Junior: What do we need
to talk about?

28:16.111 --> 28:17.442
We've kinda been hitting it off.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.652
Junior: You've been hitting it off?

28:24.453 --> 28:25.738
Hitting it off.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.455
You've been hitting it off,
or you've been hitting it?

28:31.627 --> 28:33.347
We've just been having
a good time, I guess.

28:34.296 --> 28:35.732
Well, you sure as shit ain't
staking claim

28:35.756 --> 28:37.236
on the only hot piece of ass in town.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.485
It's just not happening.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.919
Well...

28:41.011 --> 28:42.592
You know what I mean?
You're just not.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.588
No, I mean, I guess we've been
down here for a little while,

28:45.682 --> 28:47.263
so maybe it ain't happening
for you.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.052
Ain't happening?

28:58.445 --> 28:59.765
You know, she's a real nice girl,

28:59.905 --> 29:02.066
and I... I like her an awful lot.

29:03.951 --> 29:04.951
Okay?

29:05.535 --> 29:07.116
So, why don't you back off?

29:10.791 --> 29:11.826
You serious, man?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.288
You'll be all right.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.988
Why don't you grab my table for me?

30:13.854 --> 30:15.014
Kara: Sorry about that.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.313
Just not in my game today,
am I? Sorry.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.232
I didn't sleep last night.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.602
Hey, what can I get you?

30:23.780 --> 30:24.860
Pint of milk.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.023
Kara: Milk? Yeah.

30:29.786 --> 30:30.992
Kara: Yeah, milk, okay.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.534
In a pint glass,
with a shot of whiskey.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.089
Kara: Okay.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.095
Whiskey.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.340
What do you call that?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.310
Milk and bourbon in a pint glass.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.308
Okay. Junior around?

31:04.321 --> 31:06.437
No, not yet, but he will be.

31:07.324 --> 31:08.609
I'll just have a half, please.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.574
Thomas, I can't...
I can't serve you, sweetheart.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.341
You're out of money.
I'm sorry. I told you.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.658
I understand. Thank you.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.851
- Two bottles of beer and two whiskeys.
- Kara: Yeah.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.987
You may have to drink mine as well.

31:59.793 --> 32:00.999
Why ain't you drinking?

32:02.879 --> 32:03.879
I got things to do.

32:04.464 --> 32:05.464
On.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.499
I ain't got nothing to do.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.591
Drink up, mate.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.599
Fellas, two colds ones
just for y'all.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.171
You sure you don't want
nothing to eat?

32:27.195 --> 32:29.436
Y'all must be starving!
They ain't feed you out there?

32:29.531 --> 32:33.149
- Junior: Miss me, darling?
- Oh, lord, always!

32:33.243 --> 32:36.485
Junior: Hmm. I detect a slight hint
of sarcasm in your voice.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.016
Kara: Well, you should have been
a cop, not an oil man, right?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.907
Junior: Ah! See, the thing is,
oil just pays so much better.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.079
Kara: Hadn't heard that.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.377
- Hi.
- Will: Hey.

32:50.927 --> 32:51.927
Junior: Neelyn.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.138
What are you doing here?

32:57.058 --> 32:58.298
Just dropped in for a pint.

32:59.686 --> 33:00.686
Hmm.

33:02.272 --> 33:03.432
Nasty scratch you got there.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.353
Oh, you know,
had a little bit of a dust up.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.315
Man or a woman?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.044
A hillbilly who asked me
too many questions.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.025
Well, how about this one?

33:17.662 --> 33:19.198
When was the last time you saw Fiona?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.244
Oh, last call at the bar
in owingsville.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.246
She was pretty drunk, so...

33:27.672 --> 33:29.287
I walked her back to your room.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.082
Back to my room? Junior: Mmm.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.637
Now, to be honest with you,

33:39.351 --> 33:41.307
she did want
to go back to mine, but...

33:42.771 --> 33:45.228
I took her to yours, 'cause that's
the kind of guy that I am.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.389
What was that name

33:47.984 --> 33:49.378
she was calling him
there at the bar?

33:49.402 --> 33:51.188
- Stoney: Whiskey dick.
- That's it.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.737
Old... old whiskey dick.
Old whiskey dick.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.068
Yeah. Junior: That was it.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.448
Old whiskey dick.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.697
J

34:12.425 --> 34:14.255
I knew there was something
I liked about you.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.088
Why don't you meet me outside?

34:22.686 --> 34:24.246
Stoney: Oh, you don't
want to fight him.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.107
Junior: All right.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.730
All: Ooh!

34:37.742 --> 34:39.572
Will: All right, man.
You're good.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.181
- Stoney': You got him, you got him.
- You're good.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.786
Stoney: You got him. Come on.
Let's finish this. Come on.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.393
Junior: I'm just
getting started, baby.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.145
- Stoney: Easy peasy...
- I'm just getting started, baby.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.376
Will: All right, man.
All right, all right.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.501
He's drunk. Hey, no...
Leave him alone, man.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.255
Always fucking drunk.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.958
You all right, man?
You need a minute?

34:57.178 --> 34:58.509
Come on, boy!

34:59.264 --> 35:01.824
Want to try it again? Try that again.
Try that again. Right here.

35:03.393 --> 35:04.883
All: Oh!

35:09.190 --> 35:10.976
Woman: Ow!
Will: Junior, leave it.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.004
Stoney: He's okay.
Junior: You want another one?

35:13.028 --> 35:15.861
Will: Man, that's too easy.
He's too easy to fight, man.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.282
Junior: Man,
fish in a barrel, baby.

35:26.791 --> 35:27.951
All: Oh!

35:29.044 --> 35:30.521
You got him.
Yeah, you got him. You got him, bro.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.580
Junior: Fuck off.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.420
Stoney: Help him up,
so you can knock him down again.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.044
Come on.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.779
Will: Can't kick a man
while he's down.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.714
Come on, folks. Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

35:47.562 --> 35:48.842
Kara: Junior, no!
Junior: Fucker!

35:51.399 --> 35:52.935
All: Ooh!

35:54.235 --> 35:55.350
â€œAll: Oh!

36:03.828 --> 36:04.908
Man: Hey, junior, get up!

36:08.041 --> 36:09.247
Woman: What'd you do that for?

36:09.334 --> 36:12.292
Fuck!

36:12.379 --> 36:14.244
Officer: You all right?

36:21.513 --> 36:22.513
Hey, pop.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.223
What?

36:29.562 --> 36:30.677
I didn't do nothin'.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.064
So neelyn just...

36:36.986 --> 36:39.443
Jumped in a car, drove down here
to pick a fight with you...

36:41.116 --> 36:42.276
'Cause you didn't do nothin'?

36:45.078 --> 36:46.078
I guess.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.163
Kind of a crazy son of a bitch.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.711
Goddamn you.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.170
Goddamn you.

37:04.097 --> 37:06.804
Goddamn youl! Goddamn you!

37:24.492 --> 37:25.527
I want the facts.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.117
Junior: She was real drunk.

37:31.624 --> 37:32.704
I walked her to her room.

37:36.963 --> 37:37.998
I swear.

37:40.633 --> 37:41.713
Did the right thing.

37:43.678 --> 37:44.713
Preston: Okay.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.632
Now we heard the bullshit version.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.233
Why don't you to tell me
what really happened.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.397
I don't know.

37:57.734 --> 37:58.814
I went to bed.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.396
I can't control him.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.479
I'm not a spy,
I'm not a babysitter.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.108
I'm an oil man.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.612
You're the highest paid
motherfucker on this operation.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.438
You're here to keep an eye on him.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.640
You're here to keep him in line.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.064
You can't do it and you're his dad.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.329
Why don't you have him handle it?

38:28.932 --> 38:30.513
Milt doesn't finesse a situation.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.261
Milt makes a situation go away.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.009
This situation needs finesse.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.933
Me and Harris are like family.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.932
Neelyn's like family to Harris.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.858
And then there's my boy,
who fucking lies to my face.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.995
Now, will...

38:59.504 --> 39:01.304
Why don't you tell me
what you think happened?

39:03.299 --> 39:04.505
I don't know for sure.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.794
I went to bed after I saw
junior having sex with

39:09.639 --> 39:10.799
Harris's girlfriend.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.759
Oh, fuck!

39:13.726 --> 39:15.557
It's almost romantic
by junior's standards.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.556
Milt: Before we hear details
we can't unhear,

39:18.898 --> 39:20.013
I'll try finesse.

39:31.703 --> 39:32.909
You a man of god, will?

39:35.707 --> 39:36.787
Yes, sir.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.328
- Mmm.
- You?

39:42.338 --> 39:43.703
I don't know. I try to be.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.369
I sure do a lot of prayin' about...

39:52.307 --> 39:53.342
About junior.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.144
My son.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.806
My only blood.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.519
But he's a goddamn...

40:14.996 --> 40:16.031
You know...

40:18.875 --> 40:20.706
You can't just abandon
your own son,

40:20.793 --> 40:22.193
especially if he ain't got no mama.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.879
And you're a hell of an oil man, will.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.131
And you're a great foreman.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.708
But I could buy me a hundred of them.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.592
I need somebody I can trust.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.051
Somebody to be a friend to my son.

40:40.146 --> 40:43.058
To be his brains, to be his protector.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.898
I don't think I can do it.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.606
And be a man of god.

40:59.582 --> 41:00.947
Yeah, well...

41:10.051 --> 41:11.541
If you can't take care of my boy,

41:12.887 --> 41:14.502
I'm gonna have to
find somebody who can.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.300
Hello, handsome.

42:02.300 --> 42:03.770
On

42:03.771 --> 42:05.887
Uh, junior's fine.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.473
- Kara: Well...
- Junior's fine.

42:08.985 --> 42:10.191
That's too damn bad, isn't it?

42:18.244 --> 42:19.244
What is that?

42:20.913 --> 42:21.913
Quit your job.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.500
No.

42:26.461 --> 42:27.792
No, I'm not taking your money.

42:28.671 --> 42:29.877
Listen to me.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.085
I need the job
more than I need the money.

42:34.510 --> 42:38.253
I need some place that I can go
every day and every night.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.631
It keeps me straight.

42:42.852 --> 42:43.932
Goddamn.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.678
- Baby...
- Will: Well, I'm trying.

42:48.775 --> 42:49.855
Kara: I know, baby.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.985
And I love that you offered me this.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.065
But I can't take it.

43:00.328 --> 43:01.534
That's just not who I am.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.831
And I hope
you love me for not taking it,

43:08.628 --> 43:09.834
mmm?

43:09.921 --> 43:11.502
I do. I'm just...

43:13.633 --> 43:15.169
It's just your pride sometimes.

43:18.387 --> 43:19.467
Come on.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.995
Preston's only got
three things that matter to him.

43:51.921 --> 43:52.921
Family.

43:55.800 --> 43:56.800
Honor.

43:59.178 --> 44:00.178
And oil.

44:01.806 --> 44:02.806
In that order.

44:05.852 --> 44:08.434
Your girl ran off.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.020
Fooled around behind your back.

44:12.817 --> 44:13.932
Dumped you.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.631
Maybe she's gone missing.
I don't know.

44:18.489 --> 44:19.604
You're lookin' for answers.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.108
And the answers you find

44:23.202 --> 44:25.158
just might lead you right to junior.

44:33.129 --> 44:34.585
I owe my life to Preston lawford.

44:40.469 --> 44:42.589
I ain't got the time
or the energy to tell that story,

44:42.638 --> 44:44.799
and even if I did, I wouldn't.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.763
I work for him with absolute loyalty.

44:51.564 --> 44:55.398
If you go after his boy,
I gotta put you down.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.609
Right or wrong,

45:00.656 --> 45:02.863
it's just what I got to do.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.364
You're looking for Preston.

45:48.204 --> 45:49.660
You must be friends with that...

45:49.705 --> 45:50.990
I'm from London, yeah.

45:51.791 --> 45:52.791
Ah.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.866
Well, uh, can I get you anything?

45:55.962 --> 45:57.873
Beer? Cocktail?

45:59.507 --> 46:00.587
I'll have a Perrier.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.174
We don't got Perrier here.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.920
But I can get you something like it.

46:16.399 --> 46:17.399
Here you go.

46:25.241 --> 46:27.402
I just did a year.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.904
Harris: My hat's off to you, girl.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.455
Hat's off, yeah.

46:36.043 --> 46:37.954
- I'm Harris.
- I'm Kara.

46:39.171 --> 46:41.002
Kara. Very pleased to meet you.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.450
Yeah, nice to meet you too.
Yeah.

46:45.511 --> 46:48.378
You mentioned the other geezer
from London.

46:49.473 --> 46:50.508
Neelyn?

46:54.437 --> 46:55.472
You guys family?

46:59.150 --> 47:00.890
It's a very complicated question.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.104
So, where's Preston?

47:06.574 --> 47:09.065
This is my nephew
and this is my niece.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.071
- How are you, kids?
- Harris: Preston!

47:12.705 --> 47:13.785
Preston: Doop!

47:14.457 --> 47:15.817
That was a quick trip from London.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.740
Well, you said come see the site,

47:17.877 --> 47:18.997
and I took you at your word.

47:19.086 --> 47:20.314
You took the scenic route,
didn't you?

47:20.338 --> 47:21.398
I did take the scenic route.

47:21.422 --> 47:22.524
How are you, man?

47:22.548 --> 47:24.539
I'm good. I can't say
I missed you. You just left.

47:24.633 --> 47:25.964
I know.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.300
Ah! Who's your friends?

47:28.721 --> 47:30.552
We got something for you this morning.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.367
Harris: Oh!
Preston: Well, thank you, darlin'.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.256
Thank you, son.
Thank you very much.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.308
No, I... I... I ate.

47:36.395 --> 47:39.887
Harris, respect, for them, the land,

47:39.982 --> 47:41.472
and most importantly, the cooking.

47:43.152 --> 47:44.152
Thank you.

47:44.737 --> 47:45.817
Preston: Did you make this?

47:47.531 --> 47:49.271
Preston: Mmm, oh! Harris: Mmm!

47:49.367 --> 47:50.887
Preston: That is so good.
Harris: Here.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.888
Harris: Yeah.
Preston: Mmm-hmm. Oh.

47:52.912 --> 47:55.449
Mmm, I'm gonna keep mine,
all right?

47:56.707 --> 47:59.027
- Take it easy now.
- Thomas: Let's go. Let's head on back.

48:00.503 --> 48:01.788
Well, they seem to like you.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.124
Yeah? Well, I sat with them.

48:06.509 --> 48:08.716
Month after month, year after year.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.714
Harris: Hmm.
Preston: Just me and milt.

48:10.805 --> 48:12.511
No lawyers, no bullshit.

48:13.349 --> 48:14.509
I promised them two things.

48:15.518 --> 48:16.553
A good deal,

48:17.395 --> 48:19.355
and that the water
and the land would be unharmed.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.015
- Mmm.
- Turned around

48:21.107 --> 48:22.347
and gave me mineral rights.

48:24.110 --> 48:25.975
And what happens
if there's a fuck up?

48:26.070 --> 48:27.560
Like an oll spill, or something?

48:28.614 --> 48:30.479
You know better than anybody

48:30.574 --> 48:32.280
what a blood contract looks like.

48:33.828 --> 48:35.409
This here motherfuckers are serious.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.863
They love this land.
They live it.

48:38.958 --> 48:40.118
It's special to 'em.

48:41.377 --> 48:42.742
They remind me every day...

48:44.630 --> 48:46.040
I got a sacred obligation.

48:46.966 --> 48:48.456
Come on.

48:48.551 --> 48:50.257
So...

48:50.344 --> 48:51.459
Harris: Uh...

48:52.721 --> 48:54.837
You don't know where
neelyn is, do you?

48:57.059 --> 49:00.426
Fiona fucked off
and you're blaming junior?

49:01.772 --> 49:03.103
Just gathering the facts.

49:03.732 --> 49:05.723
You're on a fact-finding mission,
are you?

49:06.527 --> 49:09.189
Is that what you call
smashing a boy's head in with a rock?

49:09.697 --> 49:11.403
Come on. We're leaving, son.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.651
Me and junior haven't
finished our discussion.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.784
Oh, well,
that's too fucking bad, innit?

49:16.871 --> 49:19.487
You're coming back
to London with me.

49:20.749 --> 49:21.909
Not gonna happen, boss.

49:24.753 --> 49:26.459
Harris: Come on.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.129
Think of the money.

49:29.758 --> 49:31.749
Thousands of dollars every month

49:32.094 --> 49:35.086
without breaking a sweat or any bones.

49:36.724 --> 49:37.930
A new life.

49:40.394 --> 49:41.725
I don't want a new life.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.686
I haven't come here just to chat.

49:50.654 --> 49:51.734
Fiona's dead.

50:00.164 --> 50:03.702
All these years, I've done whatever
you've asked, followed your orders.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.790
Good men do bad things.

50:08.881 --> 50:10.496
Bad men do good things.

50:11.967 --> 50:14.629
Tricky game,
trying to label a bloke with a title.

50:16.639 --> 50:17.754
On the spectrum,

50:19.475 --> 50:21.716
on the far end
of where we operate,

50:22.770 --> 50:24.635
the bad men,
they know the difference

50:25.397 --> 50:28.230
between dark shades of grey
and pitch black.

50:29.151 --> 50:32.359
They see it, smell it,
and they feel it.

50:34.073 --> 50:35.233
And junior...

50:36.742 --> 50:37.982
He's pitch black.

50:39.620 --> 50:42.453
And after all the shit
I've done in my life,

50:44.208 --> 50:46.199
if I can't stop a beast like him,

50:46.293 --> 50:47.954
then what's my purpose?

50:53.968 --> 50:56.550
He's Preston's only family.

50:56.637 --> 50:58.719
It's his only flesh and blood.

51:00.349 --> 51:02.180
Let me take you home.

51:02.268 --> 51:04.008
Fight this battle another day.

51:13.112 --> 51:15.603
Harris: Hello?
Yeah, we're leaving now.

51:16.198 --> 51:17.984
Wheels up in 15.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.025
Harris: Good.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.915
What the... you fucking muppet.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.995
You are fucking dead to me!

51:32.256 --> 51:35.043
You're dead, dead, dead!

51:35.718 --> 51:37.049
What? What?

51:38.053 --> 51:39.714
Get the...

51:40.180 --> 51:41.761
What the...

51:41.849 --> 51:43.589
You fucking asshole.

51:57.156 --> 51:59.238
- Any trouble?
- Hell no.

52:17.384 --> 52:18.965
I'm a rifleman myself.

52:21.347 --> 52:22.712
You seem like a rifleman.

52:23.390 --> 52:24.470
Thomas: I'm good too.

52:25.517 --> 52:26.552
Real good.

52:31.607 --> 52:32.607
Neelyn: You see that?

52:35.944 --> 52:37.059
We're both steady, mate.

52:38.489 --> 52:42.107
Well, there's all kinds
of steady, ain't there?

52:43.869 --> 52:45.450
You're a wise man, Thomas.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.536
Shit.

52:53.128 --> 52:55.494
Kara: Okay, sounds good.
See y'all tomorrow.

53:03.597 --> 53:04.597
Good day?

53:05.474 --> 53:06.554
Yeah.

53:07.726 --> 53:08.806
Just got a little better.

53:09.937 --> 53:11.302
Did the early shift.
Now I'm off.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.880
Do you know where I can find junior?

53:17.361 --> 53:19.022
- Is that for him?
- Neelyn: Nah.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.937
This is for wolves and coyotes.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.490
Well, Turkey season just started
here in West Virginia, so...

53:28.163 --> 53:29.824
Well, I guess I'm Turkey hunting then.

53:34.169 --> 53:35.409
Kind of hard not to like.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.708
I mean, I can tell you're bad, but...

53:40.718 --> 53:41.753
Not.

53:43.178 --> 53:44.509
Well, if you like me so much,

53:45.931 --> 53:47.762
maybe you can set me up
with a place to stay.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.014
Look...

53:54.189 --> 53:57.522
Getting on the bad side
of Preston lawford

53:58.777 --> 54:01.314
doesn't really make
life easier for a girl.

54:04.116 --> 54:05.196
I'll tell you what.

54:06.910 --> 54:08.590
Why don't you tell me why
you care so much,

54:08.662 --> 54:10.948
and if your story moves me,

54:13.000 --> 54:14.035
then I'll help you.

54:16.795 --> 54:17.910
I can't do that right now.

54:46.325 --> 54:48.532
You can smoke in there
if you want. I do.

54:50.245 --> 54:51.360
Cheers.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.133
- Hey, man.
- Will: Hey, hey.

55:11.433 --> 55:12.889
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

55:12.976 --> 55:15.336
Junior: Of course, come on in.
You want a beer or something?

55:16.063 --> 55:18.179
Uh, no, not before
I drive down the mountain.

55:19.274 --> 55:20.954
That's why my pops calls you
the smart one.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.059
What's on your mind, man?

55:24.112 --> 55:27.354
Uh, I wanted to
talk to you about...

55:28.367 --> 55:30.107
About Kara, down at the lodge?

55:31.829 --> 55:33.149
You know,
I told you we've been...

55:34.706 --> 55:36.242
We've been spending
some time together.

55:37.209 --> 55:39.120
I like her. I'm with her.

55:40.170 --> 55:44.288
And I told you,
on these jobs in remote areas,

55:45.717 --> 55:47.298
one guy cannot be staking claim

55:47.427 --> 55:49.167
to the only hot piece of ass around.

55:50.264 --> 55:51.379
Just ain't fair.

56:00.774 --> 56:03.481
Right. And, uh...
And I've respected that,

56:03.569 --> 56:05.605
you know, when we've gone
from town to town.

56:07.531 --> 56:09.192
But Kara's different.

56:15.330 --> 56:16.410
So what are you saying?

56:27.342 --> 56:28.548
Will: We have a bond.

56:29.219 --> 56:30.334
It's somethin' special.

56:32.014 --> 56:33.049
I love her.

56:37.686 --> 56:38.766
Junior: Wow.

56:43.609 --> 56:44.644
You love her.

56:46.778 --> 56:47.858
So all you're asking...

56:49.531 --> 56:51.567
Is for me, or anybody else,
for that matter,

56:53.577 --> 56:55.067
to just stay away from her.

56:55.579 --> 56:57.490
I'm asking you to respect her.

56:58.749 --> 57:01.161
And to respect us as a couple.
That's it.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.178
Okay.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.970
Okay, man, okay.

57:21.355 --> 57:22.715
- Cool?
- Junior: Yeah, you got it.

57:23.357 --> 57:24.357
Done.

57:30.906 --> 57:33.397
- Thanks, buddy.
- Hey, I'm happy for you.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.656
- Thank you, pj.
- You're welcome, man.

57:35.744 --> 57:36.744
- All right.
- True love.

57:36.828 --> 57:40.161
Hey, true love calls for a shot.

57:40.499 --> 57:43.206
Come on. A celebration. Come on!

57:46.254 --> 57:48.620
You ain't getting out that easy.

57:56.181 --> 57:57.421
To you and Kara.

57:58.225 --> 57:59.635
- You guys are in love?
- Uh-huh.

58:00.852 --> 58:02.592
Junior: And that shit is beautiful.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.179
- Cheers, man.
- All right, man.

58:05.774 --> 58:06.980
Cheers. â€œWill: Cheers.

58:18.954 --> 58:20.034
Come on, will.

58:22.624 --> 58:23.893
After everything I've done for you,

58:23.917 --> 58:25.997
you come in here and tell me
what I can and can't do?

58:27.671 --> 58:28.831
Whose name's on the door?

58:29.631 --> 58:31.417
Whose name's
on your fucking paycheck?

58:34.845 --> 58:35.960
Come on, will.

58:40.267 --> 58:41.973
Will: Hey... please.

58:46.606 --> 58:47.686
Junior: Fix you up.

58:48.817 --> 58:51.650
Will: No. No.

59:10.505 --> 59:11.620
Junior: Unbelievable.

59:15.218 --> 59:16.378
You're done working for me.

59:17.220 --> 59:18.300
That's for damn sure.

59:20.474 --> 59:24.843
Good luck finding another job
that treats you as well as we did.

59:29.775 --> 59:31.515
Junior: Hope she was worth it.

59:51.546 --> 59:53.127
Kara: Tell me exactly what happened.

59:56.343 --> 59:57.423
Neelyn: I don't know.

59:58.512 --> 59:59.672
I'm gonna find out.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.271
Fiona: Neelyn! Neelyn!
Pick up the phone!

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:13.461
I'm lost! I don't know where I am.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:14.921
Junior: Hey, girl!
Where are you going?

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.560
Junior: Come here!

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:19.108
Junior: Hey, girl.
What are you doing?

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:55.523
Kara: I'm gonna help you
any way I can.

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:27.263
Fiona's dead.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:39.980
I'll handle it.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.900
Today or next year?

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:44.985
I'll handle it tonight.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.656
And if it leads me to junior,

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.654
I will handle it
with extreme prejudice.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:53.911
But I'll handle it.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.956
- Nobody else.
- Is that right?

01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:59.496
Just like you'll handle neelyn.

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:05.677
He ain't gonna go lightly.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.177
Yeah, well, we don't do lightly.

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:16.851
He's never betrayed me
like this before.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.110
Yeah, well, he's on his own now.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:24.528
Milt's gonna get him.

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:26.072
I'll handle neelyn.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:29.238
Nobody else but me.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.324
You and me,

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.240
we're cut from
the same cloth, brother.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.151
Hey, junior.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.616
What is so dang funny?

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:53.781
Wow.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.204
Huh?

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:59.449
You just look beautiful.

01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:02.199
I mean,
you always look beautiful.

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.650
You're just a whole 'nother shade
of beautiful this evening.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.164
Thank you.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:09.417
You always know
just what to say, don't you?

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.116
You know me.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.216
Say what's on my mind.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:14.798
No bullshit.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:17.553
What's on your mind right now?

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:20.686
Guess I'm just caught up
on how damn pretty you are.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.981
So pretty,
I can hardly look at you

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:25.229
without hurting my eyes.

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:30.021
Well, you don't look so bad yourself.

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:35.989
Let me buy you a drink.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:40.999
Oh, I'm good. I got my cranberry
on the rocks right here.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.834
Let's put some vodka in there.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:46.507
I'm good.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:51.964
Junior: Cheers.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:54.800
Cheers.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:00.969
And, I don't know,
but, I thought... oh.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.296
Will: Find yourself a new babysitter.

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:08.195
I'm done.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.494
Let's go.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.634
Stoney. Yeah.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:40.428
'Bout time you warmed up to me.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:45.022
Yeah, well, girl's gotta
work her way up the food chain.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.013
You could just start at the top.

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:50.818
I wasn't sure I was ready for you.

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:54.321
I'm still not.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.991
- Mmm.
- Slow down.

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.568
I don't do slow.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:05:59.994
You wanna know what you are?

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:02.614
I'm all business, baby.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:05.750
You're a vile piece of shit.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.789
You might wanna drop
that boner, son.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.088
Get on the floor.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:21.091
Get the fuck down, or I'll blow you
a-fuckin-way right now.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.609
I fucking found her.

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:33.903
I know you were there.

01:06:35.617 --> 01:06:36.617
She slipped.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.488
She fell.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.450
Will: Hey! Kara!

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.232
- Where is she?
- Neelyn: She's safe.

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:48.580
What's going on?

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:51.472
Well, come here.
We're just about to find out.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.589
- Pj.
- Junior: Hey, buddy.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.509
And what's your fucking story?

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:07.846
Look, we went for a drive,

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:09.977
just having some fun.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:14.398
Stoney was there.
Weren't you, stoney?

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.732
Your girl was pretty drunk, neelyn.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:23.870
Drunk, or drugged?

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.619
That's your move, ain't it?

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.075
Junior: Bullshit! Will: Is it?

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.419
What's up, stoney?
That's his move, ain't it?

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.666
Speak up. Drunk or drugged?

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:37.959
Stoney: Put the wrench down.

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:40.173
- Fucking speak up, stoney.
- Put the wrench down.

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.472
Stoney: You fuck!

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.141
Motherfucker!

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.519
Speak up!

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:58.025
Now's your time, you greasy bitch!

01:07:58.157 --> 01:07:59.693
Speak up!

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:03.151
Just fucking say something, man.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.986
Stoney: No.

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.141
Will: Fucking say something!

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.328
He drugged her at the bar.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.330
He drugged her at the bar!
She didn't know.

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:14.955
Then we went for a drive,
and then we parked.

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:18.131
And she...
They were fucking around.

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.050
And she seemed into it.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:24.923
But... but... fuck.

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:27.134
Talk like a goddamn man, stoney.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.892
All right, okay,
she wasn't into it at all.

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.223
That's fucking bullshit!

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:35.421
She came back to the bar,
'cause she wanted a real fucking man,

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.729
not a bitch.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:39.816
Maybe she just wanted a drink.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.408
Will: Every woman wants you,
right, pj?

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.493
That's right, buddy.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.404
Oh, yeah.

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:50.080
Fucked his girl on a keg
behind the bar

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.969
while you were all playing
fucking gangsters.

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:54.206
Well, congratulations, son.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.457
You shagged my hooker.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.706
Yeah, free of charge, old man.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:08:59.836
Free of charge.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.220
Would have fucked your girl
if she wasn't so goddamn clumsy.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:07.893
Milt: Neelyn.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:11.807
Enough.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.957
The beating I gave you
is gonna be nothing

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.492
compared to what's coming
Kara's way.

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:44.423
Guarantee you that, you piece of shit.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.674
- Will: What'd you fucking say?
- You fucking heard me.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.783
He won't be touching
your girl no more, will.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:09:59.312
Get the fuck out of here.

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:04.776
No more bars.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.034
No more good times.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.661
You're gonna get your shit
out of the lodge,

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:11.988
you're gonna put it in a truck,

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.116
work and sleep.

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.168
That's your life
till we finish this job.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:20.000
You hear me?

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.260
Milt...

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.739
Get this piece of shit
up to the mountains

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.094
as soon as you get his shit.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.092
Junior: How you doin', milt?

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.881
Kara: Baby. Babe.

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:36.371
Well, go on. Get on with it.

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:39.997
Or have you forgotten how to do it?

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:43.750
It was easy having me do it for you
all these years, wasn't it?

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.708
Long time since you were
in the trenches.

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:52.130
All the blood and guts.
Drinking man's game.

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:54.723
Ain't no Perrier down here.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.143
No preaching and Perrier.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.848
It was easy when you didn't have to
blow your best mate away.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:06.776
What's going on?

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:10.857
He's trying to pluck up
the courage to pull the trigger.

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:12.283
Why?

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:13.947
So that he can save his oil deal.

01:12:14.705 --> 01:12:16.665
Will: Isn't junior the one
we should all be after?

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.921
He's up at the drill site.
That's where they took him.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.166
You got a black soul.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:32.716
Tonight, so do I.

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.222
Kara: Wait, babe. Will: Come on.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:38.430
Harris: Neelyn.

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:40.974
Uh, Fiona...

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:46.816
I'm sorry.

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:52.864
Take care, guvnor.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:04.577
Will: Hurry up.

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:31.656
I need to do this alone.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.030
Get out of here.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:35.702
What?

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.613
This is between me and junior.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:40.203
No, you're not the only one
who wants...

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:08.565
Man 1: All right, come on.

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:18.571
Man 2: Over here.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.001
Hey, buddy.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.854
Man: Let's go.
Let's take a fucking walk.

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:53.439
Come on. Keep moving.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:14:59.577
Let's go.

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.578
Over here. Right there.
There you go.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.452
Right there.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.038
Nice.

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:13.046
Thanks for coming all this way, man.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.462
Appreciate it.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.593
As you know, I'm grounded,

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:19.428
so it's a bit difficult
for me to leave.

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:30.602
Just so you know, neelyn,

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.744
your girl put up
more of a fight than you did.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:35.732
I'll give her that much.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.622
Junior: Yeah, there you go.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.199
There you go. Come on. Come on!

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:49.730
Junior: Come on, motherfucker!

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:51.494
Come on. There you go, boy.
Come on!

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:54.171
Come on. Come on! Come on!

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.089
Show a little bit of fire,
motherfucker!

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:57.508
Come on!

01:15:58.721 --> 01:15:59.881
Man: Heavy decks.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.508
He don't want it no more.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.720
Come on. Just kill him.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.143
Preston: Enough.

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:10.721
Enough!

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.330
Just so you know, neelyn,

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:36.755
if it was me, I probably
would have done the same thing.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.173
Preston: Stay away from that truck,
boys. It's gonna go up.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:16:59.674
Stoney: And neelyn?
Preston: Move him, move him, move him.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.738
Get him up. Get him up.
Go, get some halon in there.

01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:03.316
- Now. Fast!
- All right.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:04.890
Stoney: Check him out.
Is he bleeding?

01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:07.995
Boys, get the fire extinguishers.
Let's get this out.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.538
Man 1: He's all right.

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:22.926
Man 2: Get the hell out of here!

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:35.605
Pj.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.855
Ah!

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.465
Look who's here to save
the fucking day.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:42.782
Put it down.

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:44.534
Fuck you.

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.992
Put it... down.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:58.333
What are you gonna do?

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.594
Don't do this.

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:08.259
Do it.

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:11.516
Do it!

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:16.063
You don't have the balls, do you?

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.596
You've always been a fucking coward.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.170
This is my purpose.

01:18:58.275 --> 01:18:59.390
Preston: Junior?

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:02.191
Will: Hey, go.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:13.217
Preston: Nobody gets down
off this mountain.

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:18.371
Nobody.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:47.233
Kara: How you feeling?

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.486
Did you feel it?

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:53.576
You always feel it.

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:01.504
Did it feel better?

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:08.042
Killing never makes it feel better.

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:11.962
It's the booze that
makes it feel better.

01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:16.926
It's over now. It's done.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.645
Six years she wasted
on a prick like me.

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:31.951
Waited.

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:40.416
If you loved each other...

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.880
There's no waste.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:58.747
They stopped Harris
coming up the mountain.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:20:59.806
He might make trouble.

01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:03.977
Wouldn't expect anything less.

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:08.189
When he gets up here, milt,

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.025
it's all between him and me.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:12.322
I can't have you involved.

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:25.252
We was 30 years old.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.299
Pj was three.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:31.761
Me and Linda,

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.464
we flew off to London to celebrate
our five-year anniversary,

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.048
left pj with his grandma.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:41.472
We was coming back one night
from a magical night.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:46.102
She was dancing on a street corner.

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:53.693
Car came around that bend so fast,

01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:55.775
she was dead before she hit
the cobblestones.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.035
Driver was drunk.

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:07.624
But what made it worse,
he was rich.

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:09.667
Connected London elite.

01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:11.836
And arrogant as fuck.

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:18.631
He was gonna walk on some bullshit
wrongful death charge.

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:22.726
My lawyer, even though he knew
everybody in town,

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:25.749
he told me that was how
it was gonna go.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:29.892
Said if I wanted any justice,
it was waiting for me...

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:32.106
In a warehouse.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.032
Harris.

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.864
Two days later, that drunk fuck

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:42.700
was never heard from or seen again.

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:46.332
Me and Harris...

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:50.628
We became blood brothers for life.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:55.342
He just did it as a favor?

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:59.054
I was a young, rich oil man, milt.

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:01.552
I could have paid him
anything he asked for.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.723
He didn't want a dime.

01:23:04.062 --> 01:23:05.427
Just wanted to be friends.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.730
Maybe one day I'd teach him
the oil business.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:15.233
We got away with it.

01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:18.899
But I'm convinced...

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.699
That the lord has been
making me pay with pj.

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:30.211
When he gets here, milt,
it's just about him and me, all right?

01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:52.982
Will: Hey.

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:56.069
Listen, Preston's men
are coming up this way.

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:59.106
Deputy's got all the roads
blocked down below.

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:02.154
I know a trail to get us outta here.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:22.679
Will: Hey, Kara.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:30.898
Listen.

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:35.142
I shot-gunned pj in cold blood.

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:38.611
Lots of withesses.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:42.903
Neelyn finished him off, but...

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:46.904
Cops are gonna be after me.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:52.124
You ready to run with that?

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:01.804
You sure?

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.779
Man: Yeah, because I said...

01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:00.091
Man: Get off that truck. Get down.
Stoney: Thank you very much.

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:12.288
Man: You guys
are lookin' good, right?

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:14.287
You. Follow me.

01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:45.861
Harris: How you doin', boys?

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.960
I'm sorry.

01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:51.964
It ain't all one-way traffic.

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.386
Fiona.

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:55.888
Yeah, I know.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.060
But I needed more time.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.475
Thought I made that clear.

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.854
Some things a man's
gotta do for himself.

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:12.151
If I had handled this,
it'd be over by now.

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:15.247
I know.

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:18.459
Retribution.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:23.624
Retribution.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:42.393
Let's drink.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:05.017
Will: It's locked.
Kara: Oh, shit.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.858
Will: It's not locked.
Get in the car.

01:30:13.116 --> 01:30:14.802
Neelyn: You hear that?

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:15.906
Oh, no.

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.051
Follow this.

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:40.928
Get outta here.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:43.848
No.

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:47.055
No, I'm not leaving you. No.

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:50.229
I need this.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.071
I can't leave her here.

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:01.410
Follow it.

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:03.742
It's your way out.

01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:20.763
Man: We got him.

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:23.174
They're on the move
by the exit road.

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:25.347
He's my boy, Harris.

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:28.222
You'd have done the same thing.

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:31.842
You would've wanted the vengeance...

01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:34.774
If only to protect your honor.

01:31:39.703 --> 01:31:40.703
Don't do it.

01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:44.742
I have to.

01:31:46.376 --> 01:31:47.661
You know I can't let you.

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.285
Well...

01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:53.379
I guess we're at odds then.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:09.095
You know you're no match
for me, brother.

01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:14.066
Maybe, maybe not.

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:22.366
Preston: Your call.

01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:37.176
One more.

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:08.996
- Here's to...
- Friendship.

01:33:12.337 --> 01:33:13.417
Friendship.

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:18.457
One that lasted...

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:21.676
A whole lot longer than most.

01:34:30.039 --> 01:34:31.529
Man 1: Come on!
Behind the truck.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:34.453
Got him! We got him!

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.108
- Go around!
- Man 2: Go around. Behind him!

01:34:39.132 --> 01:34:40.818
Man 1: Get on the radio!
Get out of the way!

01:34:40.842 --> 01:34:41.877
Move!

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:47.219
Shoot, shoot!
Don't let 'em get away!

01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:26.174
Neelyn: God.

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:29.223
Land.

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:31.843
Oil.

01:35:35.313 --> 01:35:38.305
It's often said war is waged
over just these three.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.228
Yet, if war is fought over land,

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:49.903
that land usually has
something to do with god, or oil.

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:55.447
I didn't come here
to West Virginia for god.

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:11.568
I'm done.

01:38:24.524 --> 01:38:26.324
Preston: These here
motherfuckers are serious.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:37.024
They love this land. They live it.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.485
It's special to 'em.

01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:48.332
Neelyn: Harris left behind
a little nest egg in Panama.

01:38:50.883 --> 01:38:53.215
I gave that info to Kara and will.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:25.491
When you're layin' in my arms
and you do the things you do

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:27.912
neelyn: I hope they make it out.

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:45.726
Neelyn: I think they'll do just fine.

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:48.145
I wanna kiss you all over

01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:52.725
and over again

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:57.488
I wanna kiss you all over

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:03.236
till the night closes in

01:40:04.957 --> 01:40:07.869
till the night closes in

01:40:15.635 --> 01:40:19.594
No one else can ever make me
feel the way you do

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.969
oh, so keep on loving me baby
and I'll keep loving you

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.433
well it's easy to see

01:40:26.521 --> 01:40:29.058
when something's right
or something's wrong

01:40:29.148 --> 01:40:34.142
so stay with me baby
and hold me all night long

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:38.483
show me
show me everything you do

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:42.784
'cause baby no one does it
quite like you

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:47.117
I love you

01:40:48.417 --> 01:40:49.532
I need you

01:40:53.422 --> 01:40:56.004
I wanna kiss you all over

01:40:58.844 --> 01:41:00.334
and over again

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.131
I wanna kiss you all over

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:10.349
till the night closes in

01:41:12.483 --> 01:41:15.771
till the night closes in

01:41:18.698 --> 01:41:21.155
stay with me, lay with me

01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:25.702
holding me, loving me, baby

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.372
here with me, near with me

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:34.828
feeling you close to me, baby

01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:41.459
so show me
show me everything you do

01:41:42.972 --> 01:41:46.385
'cause baby no one does it
quite like you

01:41:48.978 --> 01:41:50.218
love you

01:41:51.314 --> 01:41:52.474
need you

01:41:54.066 --> 01:41:55.272
all day

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:58.935
I wanna kiss you all over

01:42:01.741 --> 01:42:03.447
and over again

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:08.069
I wanna kiss you all over

01:42:10.833 --> 01:42:13.620
till the night closes in

01:42:15.421 --> 01:42:18.834
till the night closes in

01:42:24.597 --> 01:42:27.464
Till the night closes in

01:42:34.106 --> 01:42:37.064
Till the night closes in

01:42:43.449 --> 01:42:46.407
Till the night closes in

01:43:06.806 --> 01:43:11.140
Told myself last night I would

01:43:12.812 --> 01:43:16.600
know I oughta and I wish I could

01:43:18.734 --> 01:43:23.103
something in my soul
keeps spinning round

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:28.733
just won't let me settle down

01:43:36.836 --> 01:43:40.579
All my buddies
that I grew up with

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:46.718
got a wife, a job, a mortgage
and a couple of kids

01:43:48.389 --> 01:43:52.803
well on their way
to that life uptown

01:43:53.269 --> 01:43:58.309
and I'm trying like hell
just to settle down

01:43:59.191 --> 01:44:01.147
I wanna be a good man

01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:04.485
I wanna do the right thing

01:44:05.281 --> 01:44:09.274
I wanna do a damn good job
and earn my keep

01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:14.195
but I slip sometimes

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:17.039
I trip sometimes

01:44:17.334 --> 01:44:21.373
and the devil gets ahold of me

01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:28.881
I don't blame you if you can't stay

01:44:30.347 --> 01:44:34.590
no woman oughta have to
live this way

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:40.722
wondering when a man
will come around

01:44:41.317 --> 01:44:46.653
while he's out there trying
his best to settle down

01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:13.424
I wanna be a good man

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:16.507
I wanna do the right thing

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:21.262
I wanna do a damn good job
and earn my keep

01:45:23.275 --> 01:45:25.766
but I slip sometimes

01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:28.728
I trip sometimes

01:45:29.281 --> 01:45:33.024
and the devil gets ahold of me

01:45:36.914 --> 01:45:40.702
a wild river runs inside every man

01:45:41.293 --> 01:45:46.754
and he does his very best
to try to build a dam

01:45:47.883 --> 01:45:52.752
but something that he's
looking for and hasn't found

01:45:53.389 --> 01:45:58.804
makes it hard as hell
to ever settle down

01:45:59.395 --> 01:46:04.765
whoa, I'm trying like hell
just to settle down
