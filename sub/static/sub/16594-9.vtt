WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:05.064
(machinery grinding)

00:05.070 --> 00:07.994
Uh-oh. Oh, oh. Uh-oh.

00:09.170 --> 00:10.490
Ooh, you know what
this reminds me of?

00:10.510 --> 00:12.000
Another one of your dumb dreams?

00:12.010 --> 00:13.739
No, no, that-that space movie.

00:13.740 --> 00:17.529
Jack, now is not the time for
a star Wars cl lscusslon .

00:17.550 --> 00:19.746
Oh, I beg to differ.
Now is the perfect time,

00:19.750 --> 00:22.117
'cause I think we can get
out of it the same way.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.315
Hey, are you picking up what
I'm putting down there, Artoo?

00:23.320 --> 00:26.017
I've asked you
not to call me that.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.283
Good news: the general's men

00:27.290 --> 00:28.712
don't seem to know
where you are,

00:28.720 --> 00:30.017
which means the t_rash
compactor's on a tlmer.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.486
So if you could stop it, that...

00:31.490 --> 00:34.255
See, I told you this was
the perfect hiding spot.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.021
(wood cracks)

00:38.030 --> 00:40.499
This is definitely a
terrible hiding spot, Jack.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.764
Riley, can you
hack the controls?

00:42.770 --> 00:44.090
(beeping)

00:44.110 --> 00:45.737
No.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.663
Pretty much everything in this
place predates the transistor.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.478
Only three guards.
We could try to take them out,

00:49.480 --> 00:53.701
Threepio, you're gonna
get yourself shot in the face.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.610
The droid that does
nothing but complain?

00:56.620 --> 00:58.543
Hey, you know what,
if Artoo can't figure this out,

00:58.550 --> 01:00.245
I'm just gonna do
what Han did, hmm?

01:00.260 --> 01:01.785
Yeah, good old Dr. Jones.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.588
Yeah, well, sorry, Solo,
it didn't work in the movie,

01:03.590 --> 01:04.580
it's not gonna work here.

01:04.590 --> 01:05.728
Why not?
The compressive strength

01:05.730 --> 01:08.449
of that pipe is
500 megapascals.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.725
From hitting that wall
and putting us in between.

01:11.730 --> 01:13.721
You know what, I was wrong, Mac.
You're Threepio.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.300
Stop telling me the odds and
tell me how we're gonna escape.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.664
_ I_can't leave
a stinking corpse, man.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.661
See those rivets?
There should be a hydraulic line

01:19.680 --> 01:21.136
just on the other side
of that.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.699
So if we can puncture that,

01:22.710 --> 01:25.600
it would stop this thing,

01:25.610 --> 01:27.408
if it works.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.570
What if it doesn't work?
Then we get crushed to death.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.649
Yeah, yeah, do it, do it.
For the compressive force

01:31.650 --> 01:34.711
to overcom_e
the puncture resistance,

01:34.720 --> 01:36.859
we're gonna have to hold
the pipe perfectly normal

01:36.860 --> 01:38.123
to the walls, okay?

01:38.130 --> 01:39.859
Dude, nothing about this
is normal.

01:39.860 --> 01:44.730
Yeah, something should go boom
on the far side of the complex.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.391
Make it go boom fast,
'cause if this doesn't work,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.732
then Jack and I are gonna be...
inseparable.

01:48.740 --> 01:49.866
I know, I know.

01:49.870 --> 01:52.703
(clanking)

01:55.740 --> 01:58.107
(metal groaning)

02:00.680 --> 02:03.479
Keep it steady! Steady!

02:05.420 --> 02:06.182
(shouts)

02:06.190 --> 02:08.283
(whimpering)

02:08.289 --> 02:10.758
Are you okay?
Is it broken?

02:10.759 --> 02:12.649
I can't think straight
right now. (panting)

02:12.660 --> 02:16.324
I thought these things
were smelly on the outside.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.126
(explosion)

02:17.130 --> 02:18.791
It wprked.
Quickly.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.222
They're on the move.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.699
That was a topically
relevant Obi-Wan quote.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.429
Thanks, Jack. So does that mean
I get to be Obi-Wan?

02:26.440 --> 02:28.135
No, definitely not. No.
No, definitely not.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.492
MATFY: You got out alive,
and you managed to recover

02:50.500 --> 02:52.798
the stolen data tapes,
butJackis

02:52.800 --> 02:55.861
in the infirmary with an axial
fracture to his left radius.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.259
So what went wrong?

02:58.270 --> 03:00.739
This one's on me.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.674
I was_ so focused
on stopping that motor,

03:02.680 --> 03:05.547
I-I used a technical term
Jack didn't know.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.939
"Hold the pipe
perfectly normal"?

03:07.950 --> 03:09.941
Yeah, I was listening.

03:09.950 --> 03:13.284
Uh, what's so weird
about "normal"?

03:13.290 --> 03:15.884
In physics, it means
"perpendicular."

03:15.890 --> 03:17.756
Well, there's no guarantee
that Jack would know

03:17.760 --> 03:19.626
what the word "perpendicular"
meant either.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.792
(sighs) Look, normally--

03:21.800 --> 03:23.723
like normal-normal,
not physics normal--

03:23.730 --> 03:26.199
I can translate technical terms
lnto Jack-speak,

03:26.200 --> 03:27.668
and I didn't this time.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.331
His injury's my fault.

03:29.340 --> 03:33.334
That the two of you jumped
into the jaws of death?

03:33.340 --> 03:34.808
Look, I love Jack

03:34.810 --> 03:38.906
_ as_much as...
It's p0sslble to love Jack.

03:38.910 --> 03:41.572
And he's one of the best
operatives I've ever met,

03:41.580 --> 03:44.914
but when mistakes like this
nearly get agents killed,

03:44.920 --> 03:48.311
it's my job to ask
if this is the right fit.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.984
Maybe you need a partner
that can speak your language.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.254
(phone vibrating)

04:01.770 --> 04:03.966
Frankie?

04:05.010 --> 04:06.409
Who's Frankie?

04:06.410 --> 04:08.629
Friend of Mac's
from MIT.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.869
A close one.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.009
Yeah. What, uh...
what h... what happened?

04:19.250 --> 04:20.945
Uh...

04:23.990 --> 04:26.823
No, of course
I'll be there, yeah.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.889
Send me the...

04:30.770 --> 04:32.499
Thanks.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.540
What's going on, Mac?

04:36.540 --> 04:38.008
Is Frankie o...

04:38.010 --> 04:41.036
There was an accident.
She's, uh...

04:41.040 --> 04:43.031
she's dead.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.974
Mac...

04:45.980 --> 04:48.039
I'm sorry, man.
Yeah.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.048
(sighs) _
There's a mem0rlal In Boston.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.586
I was wondering if I could...

04:53.590 --> 04:56.287
Go. We'll deal
with all this later.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.959
(jet engine roaring)

05:02.970 --> 05:04.597
(tires screech)

05:07.070 --> 05:09.334
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:15.080 --> 05:16.570
Suit's a nice touch.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.048
You sure? You know, I was...

05:18.050 --> 05:19.973
I was worried
it was a little over-the-top,

05:19.980 --> 05:21.869
but I look good.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.076
No, no. Over-the-top
would have been

05:24.090 --> 05:26.889
using the Phoenix jet to
get to Boston before me,

05:26.890 --> 05:29.450
renting this car, and then
meeting me here with that sign.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.929
The hat and the gloves
are just the cherry on top

05:31.930 --> 05:33.853
of a banana split
of weird decisions.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.658
Bozer called me
and told me what happened.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.526
And, sure, I'm missing
mandatory rehab for my arm,

05:37.530 --> 05:39.498
but I wanted
to be here for you, man.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.094
Here you go, sir!

05:49.980 --> 05:53.109
It's a well-known fact that
people who slt up front

05:53.120 --> 05:54.576
don't tip as well.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.049
So I have that
to look forward to.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.852
Hey, Riles, with, uh, Mac
and Jack out for the day,

06:01.860 --> 06:04.079
I thought maybe you could
give me a little tutorial on...

06:04.090 --> 06:05.353
(chuckles)
(phone vibrates)

06:07.030 --> 06:09.419
Am I catching you at a bad time?

06:09.430 --> 06:11.797
Oh. No.
No, meet me in the lab in five.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.666
I'll teach you
whatever you want to know.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.702
What is it you want to know?

06:18.710 --> 06:20.439
(phone vibrates)

06:22.740 --> 06:25.641
So, how is Hawaii Boy?

06:25.650 --> 06:26.503
He's great.

06:27.450 --> 06:29.145
And his name is Kalei.

06:29.150 --> 06:30.845
Well, tell him Ka-hey for me.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.909
Will do.
(chuckles)

06:36.120 --> 06:38.088
You still have
a thing for her, huh?

06:38.090 --> 06:40.081
Who says I have a thing for her?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.159
Who doesn't?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.151
So? Do we ha\_/e
a rule against It?

06:44.170 --> 06:45.922
No.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.570
But, Bozer, there's
no "it" here.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.732
I mean, you see
that, right?

06:50.740 --> 06:53.835
It's time to move
on. Seriously.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.071
Boss, with all due respect--
and I mean this sincerely--

06:57.080 --> 06:59.174
will you please
mind your own business?

06:59.180 --> 07:02.172
When it's on my dime,
it is my business.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.875
So suck it up.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.483
Open a Tinder account.

07:06.590 --> 07:08.183
Get over it.

07:08.190 --> 07:11.114
What's she know about Tinder?

07:14.060 --> 07:15.050
(scoffs quietly)

07:15.060 --> 07:17.097
Shouldn't I be driving?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.590
Are you kidding me?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.864
My arm may be
all busted up,

07:20.870 --> 07:22.929
but whatever's going on
in that head of yours

07:22.940 --> 07:24.999
has no business
behind the wheel.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.533
And I'm really sorry
about the loss of your friend.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.040
What was her name? Frankie?

07:32.050 --> 07:33.074
Yeah.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.071
And what happened,
exactly?

07:35.080 --> 07:38.050
There was a fire in her lab.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.160
Just one of those things,
I guess.

07:43.190 --> 07:44.783
You loved her,
didn't you?

07:44.790 --> 07:46.827
Hmm?

07:46.830 --> 07:48.491
No.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.855
It wasn't like that.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.529
She was five years older,
and she had a boyfriend.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.599
Is that what you wanted to hear?
(chuckles)

07:58.610 --> 08:00.135
Besides, she was...

08:00.140 --> 08:02.780
way out of my league.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.101
Out of your league?
What, she was that gorgeous?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.044
No. Well, yeah.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.712
Yeah, she was, but...

08:09.720 --> 08:11.040
it wasn't her looks.

08:11.050 --> 08:13.212
It was her brains
that put her out of my league.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.154
Oh, so you're telling me
that she was smarter than you?

08:15.160 --> 08:16.480
Yeah.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.083
Hmm. Yeah, I don't believe that.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.649
Oh, believe it.
Mm.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.754
Frankie was a double major
in mechanical engineering

08:21.760 --> 08:22.750
and biology.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.127
She was an expert in DNA.

08:26.930 --> 08:28.898
She made me look like...

08:28.900 --> 08:30.732
(sighs)

08:30.740 --> 08:32.731
Well...

08:32.740 --> 08:34.936
she made me look like you--
no offense.

08:34.940 --> 08:37.034
_ None taken. _
You wlsh you could look llke me.

08:38.950 --> 08:42.614
I've never heard you talk
about anybody like this before.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.884
Yeah. Frankie was...

08:44.890 --> 08:46.688
(chuckles softly)

08:46.690 --> 08:48.749
...one of a kind.

08:51.730 --> 08:54.552
You know, a lot of kids,
they go to MIT and they think

08:54.560 --> 08:57.552
that they're gonna change
the world, but...

08:57.570 --> 09:01.097
Frankie...

09:01.100 --> 09:03.831
she actually c0uld've clone it.

09:07.810 --> 09:10.973
<i>MAN:
Words seem inadequate</i>

09:10.980 --> 09:13.574
<i>to express the loss
of such a...</i>

09:13.580 --> 09:16.242
gifted and giving scientist.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.541
Rosalind Franklin Mallory--

09:20.560 --> 09:22.187
(chuckles) Frankie,

09:22.190 --> 09:24.181
to those of us
who knew her well--

09:24.190 --> 09:27.023
wasn't just the smartest
person in any room.

09:27.030 --> 09:29.055
She was also the kindest.

09:29.060 --> 09:32.098
I was fortqnqte to have been
the principal sponsor

09:32.100 --> 09:34.569
for Frankie's
recent work,

09:34.570 --> 09:38.200
work that I hope will
continue someday, somehow,

09:38.210 --> 09:41.134
which is why I'm establishing
a scholarship...

09:41.140 --> 09:42.107
(quietly): _
What are you making?

09:42.110 --> 09:45.102
It's called a Mobius strip.

09:45.110 --> 09:48.569
It's a three-dimensional object
with only one side.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.241
Frankie used to love
these things.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.845
MAN: ...look to the future,
searching for solutions

09:53.860 --> 09:57.581
to mankind's
biggest problems.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.889
Mac.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.299
Thanks for coming.

10:06.070 --> 10:07.663
Of course, Smitty.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.661
Thanks for letting me know.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.263
How are her folks doing?

10:11.270 --> 10:12.669
Pretty torn up.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.263
Hell, we all are.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.271
First Dr. V, now this.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.601
Dr. Vanketesh?

10:20.180 --> 10:21.909
What happened?

10:21.920 --> 10:25.618
Oh, you don't know?

10:25.620 --> 10:27.918
His c_ar went off the road
In a snowstorm.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.651
There was a tree.

10:30.660 --> 10:33.220
He was into a coma
and never came out.

10:36.060 --> 10:38.051
Excuse me, fellas.
(clears throat)

10:38.070 --> 10:39.265
Who the hell

10:39.270 --> 10:41.932
takes candid photos
at a funeral?

10:41.940 --> 10:43.294
(camera clicks)

10:45.340 --> 10:46.967
Catch up with you later, Smitty.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.709
Yeah.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.000
Hey.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.943
Can I talk to you?

10:56.020 --> 10:57.010
Hey, there, sneaky Pete.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.169
You missed my good side.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.181
(screams)
Are you all right?

11:00.190 --> 11:02.249
(pants) He dropped his
phone, so yeah, I'm fine.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.386
Get him, Mac!

11:03.390 --> 11:04.880
Ow! (panting)

11:08.730 --> 11:11.290
he knows the campus
better than I do now.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.426
He disappeared into thin air.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.023
You get into his phone?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.667
Yeah, man,
it's definitely a burner.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.138
This guy has shots
of pretty much everyone

11:17.140 --> 11:18.232
at the service.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.366
Question is: why?

11:19.370 --> 11:23.000
While we're asking questions,
though, I got one of my own.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.375
Why did Frankie's
faculty advisor

11:24.380 --> 11:27.441
die in a car crash a month
before she died in a fire?

11:27.450 --> 11:29.441
Do what?
Yeah.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.839
And then there's this.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.390
Why would he be taking pictures
of Frankie's burnt out lab?

11:37.390 --> 11:40.428
JACK:
According to the arson reports,

11:40.430 --> 11:45.061
in an unidentified electrical
box located on the south wall.

11:47.330 --> 11:49.230
Which ignited

11:49.240 --> 11:50.696
lab chemicals

11:50.710 --> 11:54.066
that were used
as the accelerant

11:54.080 --> 11:55.275
that caused the explosion.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.079
The victim's re...

12:01.980 --> 12:03.311
Remains?

12:03.320 --> 12:05.482
Keep reading.

12:05.490 --> 12:07.379
It's fine.

12:07.390 --> 12:09.449
The victim's...

12:09.460 --> 12:13.385
remains were found five
feet from the south wall.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.054
It's presumed she was knocked
over by the initial blast.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.392
Uh, resulting gases then
caused a flashover

12:21.400 --> 12:23.437
that burned hot enough
to consume the lab equipment

12:23.440 --> 12:26.466
and the... victim's body.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.335
No.

12:28.340 --> 12:31.503
Hey, Mac, I know this has
got to be hard for you.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.205
We can get a fire team

12:33.220 --> 12:35.416
come in here again...
That's not what I meant.

12:36.780 --> 12:38.817
"No" as in
that's not what happened.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.428
Now what are you doing? What I was trained
to do: find the heart of the bomb.

12:49.430 --> 12:52.195
Come on, Mac.
You really think it was a bomb?

12:52.200 --> 12:55.761
I've seen enough bomb sites to
know when I'm standing in one.

12:55.770 --> 12:58.137
Fair enough.

12:58.140 --> 13:01.508
South wall, five feet.

13:01.510 --> 13:04.434
This device is
where the fire started.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.044
It's a piece of lab equipment
called a spectrometer.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.782
Only they don't build them
with detonators.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.882
You're right.

13:12.890 --> 13:16.258
This was no accident.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.027
<i>MATTY: _ So, I guess your axlal
fracture's all healed, then,</i>

13:24.030 --> 13:25.122
right, Jack?

13:25.130 --> 13:26.461
Because I know
that you wouldn't miss

13:26.470 --> 13:28.165
Phoenix-mandated rehab

13:28.170 --> 13:31.196
to take an unsanctioned trip
back East

13:31.210 --> 13:32.302
unless you were
fully recovered.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.108
Arm's great. Never better.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.100
Really?

13:35.110 --> 13:36.475
Let me see you do a push-up.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.232
All right.
Look, Matty,

13:38.250 --> 13:39.945
we bpth know Jack's arm
isn't any better.

13:39.950 --> 13:42.476
I know this isn't
official Phoenix business,

13:42.480 --> 13:45.017
but I also know that Frankie's
death wasn't an accident.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.249
But, Mac, Frankie was doing
post-grad work.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.240
Why would somebody
want to murder her?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.989
I don't know, Boze.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.480
JACK:
Riley, you get anything

13:50.490 --> 13:52.959
off that burner phone?
Yep, got it. Hacked it.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.951
Looks like your paparazzi tried
to e-mail this pic of Jack

13:54.960 --> 13:56.223
before you got his phone.

13:56.230 --> 13:57.891
BOZER_: _
To who? Frankie's killer?

13:57.900 --> 13:58.560
RILEY:
I don't know.

13:58.570 --> 13:59.867
Message didn't go through.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.326
Which means
I can't trace the I.P.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.195
I'll see if I can tie
this e-mail address

14:03.210 --> 14:04.439
to a physical location,

14:04.440 --> 14:06.863
but it could take some time.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.578
I need you back here in 48 hours
for another assignment.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.901
48 hours? So we can stay?

14:12.910 --> 14:15.550
Yes. You and the one-armed man

14:15.550 --> 14:18.110
have two days to find
something that will get

14:18.120 --> 14:20.179
Boston PD to reopen
Frankie's case.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.419
Okay.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.455
Thanks, boss.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.259
That was unexpectedly
nice of her.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.251
If investigators
didn't find the detonator,

14:27.260 --> 14:29.024
there must be something else
they overlooked,

14:29.030 --> 14:30.589
something that can help us
find her killer.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.466
Ugh.
Let me guess.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.892
You think I'm jumping at shadows

14:33.900 --> 14:36.961
Hey, relax. I trust
your instincts 100%,

14:36.970 --> 14:39.064
but your brain
can be overly technical.

14:39.070 --> 14:43.610
So let's think about this
from the human angle, okay?

14:43.610 --> 14:44.930
What was the motive?

14:44.950 --> 14:46.475
Bozer's question.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.175
Mm.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.239
Why would someone want Frankie dead?
Yeah.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.242
You got the usual suspects:
stalker, angry neighbor,

14:53.260 --> 14:55.149
jealous ex.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.050
But the fire didn't start
in her house.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.221
It was in her lab.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.358
Okay, so maybe
somebody didn't like

15:01.360 --> 15:03.158
what she was working
on back here.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.322
Do you know what it was?
Uh...

15:05.330 --> 15:06.968
just the general idea.

15:06.970 --> 15:08.426
It was_a new _
DNA sequencing technique.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.899
Even the most severely degraded
blood samples.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.106
She was hoping to identify
infectious diseases

15:14.110 --> 15:15.532
like Ebola before an outbreak.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.304
Okay, well, that's a big deal.

15:17.310 --> 15:20.245
_ But_ unless the Eb0l_a vir_us
IS going around starting fires,

15:20.250 --> 15:21.547
that's another dead end.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.075
Not necessarily.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.344
That new technique
could be worth a lot of money.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.318
Could put a lot
of medical research companies

15:27.320 --> 15:28.185
out of business.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.909
That's a good point.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.524
This lock look new to you?

15:35.460 --> 15:37.519
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

15:40.130 --> 15:42.690
Hey, hey. Looks like
that's not the only new thing

15:42.700 --> 15:44.429
she had installed;
check that out.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.336
Most security cameras
point towards a door.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.035
This one points
towards the street.

15:51.050 --> 15:51.972
Why?

15:51.980 --> 15:54.449
Maybe she was afraid
somebody was watching her.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.441
I doubt that hard drive
survived the fire,

15:56.450 --> 15:58.418
but a lot of these things
are backed up

15:58.420 --> 16:00.980
Riley can get in there,
tap some keys.

16:00.990 --> 16:01.980
Waste of time.

16:01.990 --> 16:03.219
Frankie was way
too paranoid

16:03.220 --> 16:06.724
to leave anything online.
In college, we used to...

16:11.370 --> 16:12.997
Used to what?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.025
Walk away in the middle
of a conversation?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.468
(Jack chuckles)

16:18.470 --> 16:21.440
Come on, let me in on it, buddy.
What are you looking for?

16:21.440 --> 16:23.534
Well, MIT is
extremely competitive.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.348
We pretty much invented
computer hacking,

16:25.350 --> 16:29.241
so to keep people
from "borrowing" your research,

16:29.250 --> 16:33.619
got into the habit of
physically backing up our work

16:33.620 --> 16:35.315
and hiding it.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.186
Okay, wait a minute.
If you're about to tell me

16:37.190 --> 16:38.316
that Frankie figured out a way

16:38.330 --> 16:40.059
to dow_nl0ad her research
lnt0 a plant,

16:40.060 --> 16:41.687
my eyeball's just gonna explode.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.198
Flash drive.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.429
Okay, well,
that makes more sense.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.738
H-How did you know
which plant to check?

16:49.740 --> 16:52.232
Oh, yeah,
because of her symbol.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.265
The Morpheus strip.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.432
<i>Morpheus was the guy
from The Matrix.</i>

16:57.450 --> 17:01.148
Oh. Yeah.
Well, I love that dude.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.346
Okay. Got a bunch
of video files here.

17:03.350 --> 17:05.147
I think this is her...

17:05.150 --> 17:07.289
journal.

17:07.290 --> 17:11.284
So, guess who's got two thumbs
and just used her new technique

17:11.290 --> 17:14.224
to reconstruct a full sequence
from a sample the FBI's lab

17:14.230 --> 17:17.154
could only get
four alleles from?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.455
Yeah.

17:18.470 --> 17:19.460
(chuckles softly)

17:19.470 --> 17:21.665
Yeah, you would've
liked her.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.269
It's her last entry.

17:26.270 --> 17:29.376
Okay, so maybe I'm just...
still freaked out about Dr. V.

17:29.380 --> 17:33.408
And I know this will sound nuts,
but I think I'm being followed.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.570
I'm fairly certain
my lab was broken into.

17:35.580 --> 17:39.483
Nothing was taken,
but, uh, things were moved.

17:39.490 --> 17:44.155
I'm gonna get new locks
installed and a camera.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.650
So, if you're watching
this video

17:45.660 --> 17:49.619
and something bad
has happened to me,

17:49.630 --> 17:52.327
I-it wasn't an accident.

17:52.330 --> 17:53.820
Someone killed my advisor,

17:53.840 --> 17:56.434
and I think they're trying
to kill me, too.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.099
See, someone was after her.

18:00.110 --> 18:01.236
She knew it.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.334
(phone vibrating)

18:03.340 --> 18:04.501
(sighs)

18:04.510 --> 18:05.500
Hey, Riley.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.400
But I was able to trace
the e-mail address

18:08.420 --> 18:11.811
to the physical location
of its last log in.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.448
I'm sending you coordinates now.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.383
MacGYVER:
This is on campus.

18:16.390 --> 18:18.279
It's in the Tombs.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.588
"The Tombs"?
Yeah, that's not ominous at all.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.420
MacGYVER: Yeah, the Tombs is
what MIT kids called a cluster

18:22.430 --> 18:25.525
We used to sneak into
them all the time.

18:25.530 --> 18:27.259
To do what?

18:27.270 --> 18:29.364
Work on experiments.
Oh. Okay.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.792
The kind the faculty
didn't approve of.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.108
They had a strict policy
on explosions.

18:33.110 --> 18:36.705
If you did college completely
wrong or completely right.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.474
Well, the person
using that e-mail

18:38.480 --> 18:39.379
is hanging out in these Tombs.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.405
That's where we're going.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.117
JACK: Wait a minute.
So, you're telling me

18:44.120 --> 18:47.841
you used to go in here,
like, on purpose?

18:47.860 --> 18:49.715
Yeah, all the time,
at night.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.781
(chuckles) You know I'm all
about "no man left behind,"

18:52.790 --> 18:54.485
but let's be _clear
on one thlng:

18:54.500 --> 18:57.253
If this place is haunted,
it's every man for himself.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.261
A) I'm faster than you,

18:59.270 --> 19:00.522
so every man for himself
works for me,

19:00.540 --> 19:02.838
and B) When you're
17 years old,

19:02.840 --> 19:04.535
playing mad scientist
with your friends,

19:04.540 --> 19:08.135
this place has
a certain charm.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.869
All right. (sighs)

19:10.680 --> 19:12.705
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.371
Look, somebody
rigged the door.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.575
You're right.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.612
Trip wire
leading to a cell phone.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.882
Rigged to let
whoever's down here

19:24.890 --> 19:26.324
know they've got company.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.549
The detonator you found
in Frankie's lab

19:31.570 --> 19:33.163
was pretty makeshift, as well.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.899
You know, this is
starting to look like

19:34.900 --> 19:36.561
your handiwork, dude.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.265
(door creaks, closes)

19:40.240 --> 19:42.834
Whoever made that I
think just made us.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.808
(whispers):
Go.

19:56.220 --> 19:57.551
Where are we going?!

19:57.560 --> 19:59.528
Shortcut!

20:06.570 --> 20:07.696
(grunts)

20:07.700 --> 20:09.566
Let's see who the bastard is
who killed...

20:11.710 --> 20:13.269
Frankie?

20:13.270 --> 20:14.908
Mac.

20:14.910 --> 20:17.277
Oh, I can't wait
to hear this one.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.271
(panting)

20:30.290 --> 20:31.815
Hmm?
(MacGyver chuckles)

20:31.830 --> 20:32.820
Whoa.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.990
(chuckles):
Whoa.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.492
I am getting a real
"separated at birth"

20:39.500 --> 20:40.968
kind of vibe here.

20:40.970 --> 20:43.393
Are you sure
your last name's not MacGyver?

20:43.400 --> 20:46.631
Please. Mac wishes he had my
flair for interior design.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.938
And I know it's not much,
but IKEA doesn't exactly have

20:48.940 --> 20:50.874
a "hiding out after faking
your own death" aisle,

20:50.880 --> 20:52.439
so I had to make do.

20:52.450 --> 20:55.010
(chuckles) Well, I love
what you've clone with the place.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.875
Thank you.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.871
So, how did you find me?

20:58.890 --> 21:01.916
A pretty decent job
of covering my tracks.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.355
Well, we traced the e-mail
address your photographer friend

21:04.360 --> 21:05.782
tried to send those pics to.

21:05.790 --> 21:08.760
I st_ill c_:an't believe _
you invited paparazzi

21:08.760 --> 21:10.250
to crash your memorial.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.954
Man, I'm stealing that one.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.564
A) It's "paparazzo,"

21:14.570 --> 21:17.699
B) I thought whoever wanted me
dead might show their face.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.508
I couldn't exactly go
to my own funeral.

21:19.510 --> 21:21.831
Oh, you have the phone?
Uh, yeah.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.831
Your parents were, uh...

21:23.850 --> 21:26.876
No, I had to keep them
in the dark to keep them safe.

21:26.880 --> 21:31.317
Or my would-be killer could've
used them to get to me, so...

21:33.350 --> 21:35.887
Richard Sang gave my eulogy?

21:35.890 --> 21:36.880
(chuckles)
Wow.

21:38.690 --> 21:40.351
Smitty actually wore a tie.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.725
(laughs):
I know.

21:41.730 --> 21:43.425
Now I wish I would've gone.

21:43.430 --> 21:46.730
Yeah, I mean...
coworkers, family, friends--

21:46.730 --> 21:48.391
I don't see anyone I don't know,

21:48.400 --> 21:50.289
and none of these people
wanted me dead.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.039
JACK: Okay, well, any
idea why your death

21:52.040 --> 21:54.600
would be on someone's
to-do llst?

21:54.610 --> 21:55.736
Maybe.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.401
Mac, do you remember
my thesis project?

21:57.410 --> 22:01.005
"DNA Reconstruction
via RNA-Guided CRISPR-Cas9

22:01.020 --> 22:03.045
and Pattern-Matching
Algorithms"?

22:04.420 --> 22:06.639
You made me proof
948 pages six times.

22:06.650 --> 22:08.482
So, yeah,
it kind of rings a bell.

22:08.490 --> 22:10.083
Just, um, explain it to someone

22:10.090 --> 22:12.627
who maybe flunked math,
biology and chemistry.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.485
All three?

22:14.500 --> 22:15.990
Okay, uh...

22:16.000 --> 22:17.889
well, um...

22:17.900 --> 22:19.891
think of it like this:

22:19.900 --> 22:21.994
you remember Humpty Dumpty?
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.594
My technique can put his DNA
back together again.

22:24.610 --> 22:27.466
See, Dr. V and I were trying
to find a way to sequence

22:27.480 --> 22:29.039
viral genomes.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.975
We ended up failing at that but
stumbled into a breakthrough.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.903
A _method for
recovering full genomes

22:33.920 --> 22:35.376
from even
badly-degraded DNA.

22:35.380 --> 22:36.848
So we did what anyone
would've done...

22:36.850 --> 22:38.909
You know what I would've clone?
I would've taken

22:38.920 --> 22:41.116
DNA from a frog and
put it into a T. rex,

22:41.120 --> 22:42.815
like a little mini

22:42.820 --> 22:43.855
<i>Jurassic Park,
you know what I--</i>

22:43.860 --> 22:45.089
You didn't do
that, did you?

22:45.090 --> 22:47.730
Uh, no, not exactly.
Okay.

22:47.730 --> 22:49.459
We asked the cops
for blood samples.

22:50.430 --> 22:52.023
Uh, closed cases, so we could...

22:52.030 --> 22:53.862
Create a control group to see if
your technique actually worked.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.793
And it did.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.359
The results were incredible.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.670
We were able to sequence it
with a 94% accuracy.

23:02.410 --> 23:04.970
So Boston PD upped the ante.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.869
They sent us a cold case.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.009
Sample... Ah.

23:10.020 --> 23:13.388
A35-B42-1707. Yeah.

23:13.390 --> 23:15.017
Cops knew this blood
was the killer's,

23:15.020 --> 23:16.681
but all current methods
of DNA testing

23:16.690 --> 23:17.953
had failed to sequence it.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.849
But your method could.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.783
So this is all happening
because your research

23:21.800 --> 23:23.427
put you on the trail
of a killer.

23:23.430 --> 23:24.920
And let me guess:

23:24.930 --> 23:26.921
right when you were
about to I.D. him,

23:26.930 --> 23:28.898
your little lab went kaboom.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.733
I didn't go ka boom with it.
Mm .

23:31.740 --> 23:33.469
Actually, that night,
I woke up from a dream

23:33.470 --> 23:34.904
about a single-n_ucleotide
polymorphism,

23:34.910 --> 23:38.073
so I ran to my lab to adjust
the spectrometer settings,

23:38.080 --> 23:40.970
stumbled onto the device someone
planted, quickly did the math.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.869
So if the person
who had planted the bomb

23:42.880 --> 23:44.075
knew that you survived
the first attempt,

23:44.090 --> 23:45.478
then they would try again.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.049
Yeah, and my odds
were against me

23:47.050 --> 23:49.985
that I'd stumble into it the
next try before it killed me.

23:50.790 --> 23:53.487
So, I whipped up an accelerant

23:53.490 --> 23:55.458
to, uh, make the fire
burn hot enough

23:55.460 --> 23:57.155
to sel_l a crime scene
with no body.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.098
I thought if I could
get away clean

24:00.100 --> 24:02.068
with the blood samples,
I'd have a chance

24:02.070 --> 24:05.062
to regroup and figure out
who's after me.

24:05.070 --> 24:09.678
Or whoever sample A35-B42-1707
belonged to.

24:09.680 --> 24:14.049
It sounds to me like Mr... A35
has the cops on his payroll.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.917
How else would he even know
Frankie was about to I.D. him?

24:16.920 --> 24:20.015
You don't still have
the blood sample, do you?

24:23.060 --> 24:26.121
For all the good it'll do us
without sequencing equipment.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.026
Oh, I think we can handle that.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.919
Yeah, we got all that stuff.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.092
Uh, that's sweet,

24:34.100 --> 24:37.035
but I'm not sure what two guys
from a think tank can do.

24:38.740 --> 24:42.506
Well, to be fair, it's
one hell of a think tank.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.978
Okay, so we did
some digging

24:43.980 --> 24:47.041
and we found the Boston PD
case file that sample

24:47.050 --> 24:51.078
A35-B42-1707 was pulled from.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.081
Sending it to you now.

24:53.090 --> 24:55.912
Victim's name_was
Ronald Manning,

24:55.920 --> 24:57.615
reporter from Southie

24:57.630 --> 24:59.587
found shot to death
in his backyard.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.082
Police found signs that
he struggled with his killer,

25:02.100 --> 25:06.094
underneath his fingernails,
but the body was outside

25:06.100 --> 25:08.626
for a week and it
had rained, so...

25:08.640 --> 25:11.837
Yeah, blah, blah, blah, boring.
Boring C5! mumbo jumbo.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.138
Bottom line, whoever offed
Ronnie is now trying

25:14.140 --> 25:15.767
to take out Frankie
to cover his tracks.

25:15.780 --> 25:19.648
So who knew you were working
with Boston PD, Frankie?

25:19.650 --> 25:21.175
Lot of people.

25:21.180 --> 25:23.672
My advisor, my department head,
two dozen grad students

25:23.680 --> 25:25.011
and post-docs.

25:25.020 --> 25:26.988
It's npt like
what I was dolng was secret.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.981
Okay, so we just
use Frankie's technique

25:28.990 --> 25:31.857
to rebuild the DNA,
run the results through CODIS,

25:31.860 --> 25:34.886
and then...
cross our fingers for a match.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.629
Hey, uh, try to keep up,
boy genius.

25:36.630 --> 25:38.689
My lab was incinerated,
remember?

25:38.700 --> 25:43.137
But_I've never bee_n one to let
a little arson get In my way.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.231
FRANKIE:
Never took this long before.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.708
(door rattling)

25:46.710 --> 25:48.166
MacGYVER:
Yeah, well, it's a new lock.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.002
This tumbler has eight pins,
so it takes a little...

25:52.950 --> 25:55.146
"J0ngen

25:55.150 --> 25:57.141
Wow.

25:57.150 --> 25:58.311
This brings
back memories.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.789
It's like being
in a time machine, huh?

26:00.790 --> 26:03.111
Yeah. This was my home away
from home when I was enrolled.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.851
Oh, that's funny.
You know, my home away from home

26:05.860 --> 26:07.919
was this bar in college
called Slappy's.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.750
I called it Sl0ppy's, but...

26:09.760 --> 26:12.127
Yeah, uh, I think we can guess
why you called it that, Jack.

26:12.130 --> 26:15.100
Yeah, it's 'pause I got
pretty sloppy In there, yeah.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.068
Okay.

26:17.070 --> 26:19.129
First step is extracting
the viable DNA

26:19.140 --> 26:20.665
from the blood sample.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.239
Okay, what tubes are we using?

26:22.240 --> 26:25.175
Uh, one-point-fives.
We'll need, uh...

26:25.180 --> 26:28.206
One for the sample and one
to balance the centrifuge.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.245
I do remember
some stuff.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.649
So...

26:31.650 --> 26:34.620
once we separate the
cells from the serum...

26:34.620 --> 26:36.782
We'll need to extra_ct
as much clot as possible,

26:36.790 --> 26:38.110
then prep for
electrophoresis.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.280
See, the secret
behind the technique

26:40.290 --> 26:42.952
Dr. V and I stumbled
into is the gel

26:42.960 --> 26:44.121
we run through the capillaries.

26:44.130 --> 26:45.120
Mm.

26:45.130 --> 26:47.667
It's a... original recipe.

26:47.670 --> 26:50.662
Okay, I think I'm gonna let
you two nerds get your flirt on,

26:50.670 --> 26:52.035
check the perimeter.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.065
Enjoy yourselves.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.239
Glad to see you can
still identify a 1.5.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.207
After all that time
you made me your lab lackey,

27:01.220 --> 27:04.713
Barely had time
to do my own research.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.142
Oh, are you kidding?

27:06.150 --> 27:08.812
You were looking for
an excuse not to work.

27:08.820 --> 27:11.255
You said you had to
"let your research breathe."

27:11.260 --> 27:12.284
(chuckles)

27:12.290 --> 27:14.156
Here. Last one's
for you.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.049
Ready to get your life back?

27:16.060 --> 27:18.051
(exhales)

27:18.070 --> 27:20.129
Kind of crazy to be
working with you again.

27:20.130 --> 27:21.620
It's kind of like I never left.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.937
Yeah, but you did.

27:23.970 --> 27:26.359
Dropped out without a word
of explanation.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.361
Enlisted in the...

27:28.380 --> 27:29.973
Army, I heard?

27:29.980 --> 27:31.971
(ringtone plays) _
Yeah, what's shaking, Threepl0?

27:31.980 --> 27:33.277
BOZER:
I thought we both agreed

27:33.280 --> 27:34.645
Mac was Threepio.

27:34.650 --> 27:35.799
Clearly, I'm Boba Fett.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.812
Boba Fett?
Boba Fett was a badass, man.

27:38.820 --> 27:41.312
He was, like, the best
bounty hunter in the galaxy.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.015
And, just for saying that,

27:43.020 --> 27:46.650
you're more like that
fat, worthless one-- Jabba.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.685
This is what I get for calling you.
Ancl about that--

27:48.700 --> 27:50.020
you always call Mac
when you need something.

27:50.030 --> 27:51.725
What are you calling me for?
What do you want?

27:51.730 --> 27:54.427
Okay, fine, fine,
you got me, Jack.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.137
I'm calling about Riley.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.130
Why? Is she okay?

27:58.140 --> 27:59.801
She's fine, I'm not.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.130
Ever since Hawaii,
Captain Aloha's

28:01.140 --> 28:02.835
been blowing up
her phone nonstop.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.376
And she's all giggles
and smiles and...

28:04.380 --> 28:06.041
I need your help, man.

28:06.050 --> 28:08.269
I mean, I'm stuck in
the friend zone, and I don't...

28:08.280 --> 28:10.339
You're stuck in the friend zone?
Okay, couple things.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.170
First of all, "stuck" implies
that you deserve

28:12.190 --> 28:14.045
to be in some other
type of zone.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.188
And that ain't up to you, man,
that's up to her.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.682
That's always up to the girl,
you should know that. Second...

28:18.690 --> 28:20.283
Okay, but what I'm...
Hey, don't interrupt.

28:20.290 --> 28:22.088
I'm not done.

28:22.100 --> 28:25.821
Second, anybody who can
call Riley Davis a close,

28:25.830 --> 28:28.219
personal friend is lucky.
She's a good person, man.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.937
And third, if you don't
start taking no for an answer,

28:30.940 --> 28:33.864
I'm gonna go all Wookiee on you
and rip your...

28:33.870 --> 28:35.929
arms off.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.047
Got to go, Jabba.
Good talk, man.

28:42.050 --> 28:44.109
(tires screeching)

28:46.290 --> 28:49.954
Time to pack up the science
fair. We go company. Let's go.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.951
What? Why? The centrifuge
hasn't started spinning.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.450
We still need to separate
the serum...

28:53.460 --> 28:55.280
Hey, we're about to have
our serum separated.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.190
How many? Only six. But they got guns, man.
Let's bounce.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.292
Guns?

28:59.300 --> 29:00.495
Yeah, those things
that'll kill you.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.797
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.336
Come on, we need to go.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.866
Mac...
Look, I already lost you once.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.269
I'm not gonna let you die again.

29:07.270 --> 29:08.499
Let's pack up, let's go.

29:08.510 --> 29:10.774
Yeah.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.192
(elevator bell clings)

29:51.080 --> 29:53.390
If this is all they want, maybe
we just give it to them, huh?

29:53.390 --> 29:55.245
Maybe they'll go away.
Yeah, Frankie,

29:55.260 --> 29:57.319
I'm pretty sure a six-man
private security team

29:57.320 --> 29:59.084
is here to make you go away.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.258
Hey, you know what it is?

30:01.260 --> 30:03.456
_ It's time to see _
Just how good Uncle Jack ls

30:03.460 --> 30:05.053
with just his right hook.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.267
No, no, no, no. I got an idea,
I think. Just hold on.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.172
What are you making? It's an electric whip.
Watch out for the end.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.217
(laughs):
Oh! Yes, yes.

30:24.220 --> 30:25.972
Hey, you-you know,
back in Texas,

30:25.990 --> 30:27.082
I was, uh...
Junior whip-cracking champion?

30:27.090 --> 30:28.080
Yeah.
Three years running?

30:28.090 --> 30:29.182
Yeah.
I know.

30:29.190 --> 30:31.056
JACK: Yeah, well,
she doesn't.

30:31.060 --> 30:33.279
Who says I was talking to you anyway, man?
Guys, they're coming.

30:35.530 --> 30:36.895
Yeah, watch out.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.095
(electricity crackling)

30:40.300 --> 30:42.098
(men grunting)

30:51.140 --> 30:52.210
That was awesome.

30:52.210 --> 30:53.348
Come on, there's
gonna be more coming.

30:53.350 --> 30:54.340
Mac, what the hell
have you been doing

30:54.350 --> 30:55.340
since you dropped out of school?

30:55.350 --> 30:58.376
(panting) Come on, come on.

30:58.390 --> 31:02.042
I'm having trouble
wrapping my head around this.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.552
Boy genius is a spy now?

31:04.560 --> 31:07.029
Between the two of us, I think
I should be more freaked out,

31:07.030 --> 31:11.354
since up until four hours ago,
I thought you were dead.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.395
(phone chiming, vibrating)

31:13.400 --> 31:15.095
Hey, Riley.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.295
Take all the wireless chips

31:16.300 --> 31:17.859
out of Frankie's laptop now.
Right now.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.032
Whoever's after Frankie
hid spyware on her hard drive.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.075
As soon as
she connected to Wi-Fi,

31:25.080 --> 31:26.570
it sent out her GPS coordinates.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.106
That's how they found us.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.248
Riley, is there any way you can
trace this back to the killer?

31:31.250 --> 31:32.570
I'm trying, but so far, no luck.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.240
If they know I'm still alive

31:34.260 --> 31:36.217
and they can't find me, they're
gonna go after my parents.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.314
I need to just get them
in the car and leave town.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.049
No, no, no. These guys are not
gonna stop until they find you.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.357
And besides,
if you leave now,

31:42.360 --> 31:46.593
Oh, my work? Yeah, who cares about my work?
I do. Frankie,

31:46.600 --> 31:48.989
everything we used to talk about
you're actually doing now.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.332
I can't just let you walk away from it.
Mac, this isn't about you.

31:51.340 --> 31:53.001
No, you're right.
It's not about me.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.466
It's about you and what
you're doing for the world.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.606
Hey, stop. Look at me.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.237
Yesterday, I thought
that you were dead,

31:57.240 --> 32:01.245
and if you walk away now, if
you just run... you kind of are.

32:01.250 --> 32:05.574
So... please just let me
help you get your life back.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.649
How, Mac? Our only hope
of finding the killer

32:07.660 --> 32:12.951
They blew up my lab, and we
can't go back to the one at MIT.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.621
Do you remember
Dr. V's favorite saying?

32:14.630 --> 32:18.123
"'Imp0ssible' is not
a scientific term."

32:18.130 --> 32:21.464
So, if the only thing
we don't have is a lab...

32:21.470 --> 32:23.359
we'll just have to make one.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.359
I get knocked down,
but I get up again

32:28.380 --> 32:30.132
You're never gonna
keep me down

32:30.140 --> 32:32.131
I get knocked down,
but I get up again...

32:32.150 --> 32:36.200
Kegger at-at Smitty's
tonight, 11:00 p.m.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.245
Hey, we're making
moonshine.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.570
Pass it on.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.513
Tell all your nerd buddies.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.285
$0 <i>[got</i> almost everything
on your list, um,

32:44.290 --> 32:45.587
I think,
except for, uh,

32:45.590 --> 32:48.355
"Cas9 Nuclease 1 nmol."

32:48.360 --> 32:50.328
M-Mol?

32:50.330 --> 32:51.991
Y'all still need that?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.968
Only if we want it to work.

32:53.970 --> 32:55.961
Okay, so that's a "yes,"
smart-ass.

32:55.970 --> 32:58.234
Also, you wrote
"powdered gelatin."

32:58.240 --> 32:59.389
You mean, like, Jell-O?

32:59.410 --> 33:01.560
Yeah, we need it
for electrophoresis.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.538
Okay, yeah, that's... that's
what I thought. All right.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.008
Oh, unflavored gelatin

33:07.010 --> 33:08.205
only, Jack.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.506
Frankie _has _
a very specific recipe,

33:09.520 --> 33:11.079
so Jell-O won't work.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.741
So... no cherry-flavored?

33:33.270 --> 33:35.364
Can I ask you something?

33:35.380 --> 33:38.270
I know it doesn't look like
much, but it's gonna...

33:38.280 --> 33:40.408
No, it's not about that.
It's about you.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.642
You were one of
the smartest guys here.

33:43.650 --> 33:45.539
You want to know why I left?

33:47.520 --> 33:50.080
I'm not saying that
you chose the wrong path.

33:50.090 --> 33:53.583
It's just... not the one
I would have seen you taking.

33:53.590 --> 33:56.252
Me, either... honestly.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.520
But...

34:01.540 --> 34:03.599
I was walking
across campus one clay,

34:03.600 --> 34:06.501
trying to visualize
a nine-dimensional polytope,

34:06.510 --> 34:08.467
when my grandfather called.

34:08.480 --> 34:13.600
And one of his old
war buddies died.

34:13.610 --> 34:16.101
The guy who saved
his life, actually.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.339
And...

34:20.320 --> 34:23.085
...it made me_ r_ealize
that whlle I'm sitting here

34:23.090 --> 34:26.081
trying to solve
theoretical problems,

34:26.090 --> 34:27.489
soldiers were facing real ones.

34:27.489 --> 34:29.424
Real problems
that I could solve.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.620
I mean, I loved it here.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.495
I did.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.797
Being around people like us.
It's amazing.

34:38.810 --> 34:42.360
But...

34:42.380 --> 34:45.771
everything we did was so...

34:45.780 --> 34:48.078
abstract.

34:48.080 --> 34:51.277
And I just needed something
a little more hands-on,

34:51.290 --> 34:54.179
and enlisted,
and before I knew it,

34:54.190 --> 34:56.112
I was diffusing IEDs
in Afghanistan.

35:02.860 --> 35:05.249
Did you just make a centrifuge
out of cardboard?

35:05.270 --> 35:07.625
Oh, is that what I just did?

35:09.500 --> 35:11.696
It'll spin at 20,000 RPMs,

35:11.710 --> 35:14.338
enough to separate your
blood sample for sequencing.

35:21.210 --> 35:22.507
No match.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.715
Try the foreign
DNA database.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.711
(computer trilling)

35:25.720 --> 35:28.212
No match.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.517
No match.

35:31.490 --> 35:32.480
No match.

35:32.490 --> 35:33.787
Are you trying
to tell me

35:33.790 --> 35:35.519
I just stole all
that lab equipment

35:35.530 --> 35:36.281
for nothing?

35:36.300 --> 35:38.120
Maybe not nothing.

35:38.130 --> 35:40.622
Those databases-- they only
check for 13 genetic markers,

35:40.630 --> 35:42.359
but we_ have the killer's
entire sequence.

35:42.370 --> 35:44.134
There has to be something
we can do

35:44.140 --> 35:45.289
with all that extra information.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.438
Well, there's
phenotype prediction.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.478
With a full human genome, you
can determine sex, age, skin,

35:50.480 --> 35:51.732
hair, eye color
and facial structure.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.605
You can even tell
if they have freckles.

35:53.610 --> 35:56.671
So even though we can't find
the killer in every database,

35:56.680 --> 35:58.341
we can sketch
what he looks like?

35:58.350 --> 36:00.216
Yeah.
BOZER: Actually,

36:00.220 --> 36:02.746
if you send me that info,
I think I can do you one better.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.480
_("Supe_rfly" by
Cums MaYfleld playing)

36:09.630 --> 36:12.622
Darkest of night
with the moon shining bright

36:12.630 --> 36:17.192
There's a set going strong,
lot of things going on

36:17.200 --> 36:20.864
The man of the hour
has an air of great power

36:20.870 --> 36:24.306
The dudes have envied him
for so long

36:24.310 --> 36:27.280
Oh, Superfly

36:27.280 --> 36:30.545
You're gonna make your fortune
by and by

36:30.550 --> 36:35.215
But if you lose,
don't ask no questions why

36:35.220 --> 36:38.611
The only game
you know is Do or Die...

36:38.630 --> 36:40.553
I'm still working
on the hair,

36:40.560 --> 36:42.949
but if the age and facial
structure you gave me is right,

36:42.960 --> 36:45.600
then this...

36:45.600 --> 36:47.568
is the face of our killer.

36:47.570 --> 36:50.437
Oh, my God.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.569
Am I crazy, or isn't that the
same dude who gave your eulogy?

36:54.440 --> 36:55.669
You're not crazy.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.500
It's Richard Sang.

36:57.510 --> 37:00.445
Okay. Who's Richard Sang?

37:00.450 --> 37:02.407
Just one of the most
powerful men in Boston.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.315
JACK: And apparently,
one of the most dangerous.

37:12.390 --> 37:16.349
<i>SANG: And it is my great honor
to dedicate this new facility.</i>

37:16.360 --> 37:18.897
Despite recent tragic setbacks,

37:18.900 --> 37:22.859
the future of scientific
research at MIT is bright.

37:22.870 --> 37:24.599
<i>JACK:
$0, the same dude</i>

37:24.610 --> 37:26.601
who fronted your research
is the same dude

37:26.610 --> 37:28.260
you almost busted for murder?
(phone chimes)

37:28.280 --> 37:31.602
(sighs) What are
the odds of that?

37:31.610 --> 37:34.807
Sang is one of MIT's
most generous benefactors.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.243
I can't believe he'd
do something like this.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.775
Believe it.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.884
Riley found proof
the reporter Sang murdered

37:40.890 --> 37:42.380
was about to expose him

37:42.390 --> 37:43.710
for massive fraud.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.688
Yeah, but we're gonna need
more than hacked e-mails

37:45.690 --> 37:48.728
and one of B0zer's creepy
clay heads to nail this guy.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.391
If I could get a
sample of his DNA,

37:50.400 --> 37:51.925
I could provide a conclusive match.
Okay.

37:51.930 --> 37:55.560
So we need a strand of hair,
a glass he drank from or what?

37:55.570 --> 37:57.299
Unfortunately, my technique
only works on blood.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.894
That's okay. Drawing blood's
my specialty, sweetheart.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.535
(cameras clicking)

38:08.510 --> 38:10.012
FRANKIE:
Mr. Sang?

38:10.020 --> 38:11.647
Mr. Sang?

38:11.650 --> 38:13.709
Will this facility continue
developing the, uh,

38:13.720 --> 38:15.586
Vanketesh-Mallory DNA
sequencing technique?

38:15.590 --> 38:18.855
Or did you think that avenue of
research was pretty much dead?

38:18.860 --> 38:21.625
Frankie. My God, you're...

38:21.630 --> 38:25.021
Oh, very much so... no thanks to you.
What? I don't...

38:25.030 --> 38:27.328
Mr. Sang, we should talk.

38:27.330 --> 38:28.991
Come with us.

38:29.770 --> 38:30.999
Hey, Dick!

38:35.440 --> 38:37.033
(groaning)

38:37.040 --> 38:39.338
Actually, I think campus police
can take it from here.

38:39.350 --> 38:40.749
Oh, great. Officers,
I'd like to confess

38:40.750 --> 38:42.400
to an assault via sucker punch.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.673
I don't suppose either one
of you rent-a-cops has

38:44.690 --> 38:45.816
an evidence bag on you, do you?

38:45.820 --> 38:48.312
Ha-ha!
Hungry like the wolf, son.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.549
(laughs, groans)

38:50.520 --> 38:51.817
(laughs)

38:51.830 --> 38:53.059
The blood on
Jack's ring is

38:53.060 --> 38:55.051
a 13-point match
to the killer.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.529
MATFY: Sang is being taken
into custody as we speak.

38:57.530 --> 38:59.658
And I had a chat
with the local FBI.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.729
He's not gonna buy his way
out of this one.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.969
BOZER:
So, they're gonna need this

39:02.970 --> 39:04.734
for evidence, or whatever?

39:04.740 --> 39:06.560
'Cause I worked
really hard on it.

39:06.570 --> 39:10.336
And thanks, everyone,
for helping us out.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.377
And you did it
with six hours to spare.

39:12.380 --> 39:15.702
So get your butts back on
a plane and get home now.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.711
Both of you.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.587
Jack, you think you can con
your way into the French embassy

39:20.590 --> 39:21.944
with that sling on your arm?

39:21.960 --> 39:24.452
<i>(French accent): But
of course, mon ami.</i>

39:24.460 --> 39:25.757
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

39:25.760 --> 39:28.525
Okay, that's Italian.

39:28.530 --> 39:29.429
Whatever.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.719
Little love.

39:32.730 --> 39:34.721
Ah.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.469
(chuckles)

39:39.840 --> 39:43.674
Well, boy genius,

39:43.680 --> 39:46.479
any chance I could
convince you to stay?

39:46.480 --> 39:50.678
Honestly, Frankie, there's
a part of me that wants to.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.774
And then there's
that other part, yeah.

39:52.790 --> 39:53.939
Yeah.

39:53.950 --> 39:55.714
But, hey, if
you hit a snag,

39:55.720 --> 39:57.017
if you want to
brainstorm ideas...

39:57.020 --> 39:58.613
Mm.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.951
...or if you just want to
tell me how you're doing.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.155
I think we're smart enough

40:02.160 --> 40:04.492
to, uh, figure out
how to use a telephone.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.752
Or build one.

40:24.150 --> 40:26.414
(phone vibrates)

40:29.160 --> 40:30.787
Hey, Riley.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.122
I'm, uh...

40:34.130 --> 40:35.689
I'm sorry.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.792
For what?

40:36.800 --> 40:37.949
For, you know,

40:37.960 --> 40:40.827
not taking any
of the one billion hints

40:40.830 --> 40:42.161
you've been dropping.

40:42.170 --> 40:44.138
And for making things weird
about Captain Aloha.

40:45.470 --> 40:48.167
I mean... Kalei.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.776
I let my hopes
about what we could be...

40:53.780 --> 40:55.771
blind me to what we are.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.111
And what we are

40:57.120 --> 40:59.839
<i>i$---</i> pretty great.

40:59.850 --> 41:02.979
Are you saying you're finally
ready to be my friend?

41:03.760 --> 41:05.114
Then could we please
grab a burger

41:05.130 --> 41:06.484
<i>and talk about
Resident Evil 7?</i>

41:06.490 --> 41:08.481
Absolutely. On one condition.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.820
Can you give me some advice?

41:09.830 --> 41:11.753
'Cause, uh, I've been
thinking about my game,

41:11.770 --> 41:13.898
and it could probably use
some tweaks.

41:14.670 --> 41:15.865
Yeah. Little tweaks.
Yeah.

41:15.870 --> 41:18.794
All right. So, when
it come to women...

41:18.810 --> 41:21.905
You know I've been thinking,
maybe Frankie was right, man.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.571
Maybe you should stay here.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.230
Jack.
No, I'm not kidding.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.810
I mean, Frankie and you
are both so smart and in sync,

41:27.810 --> 41:29.676
I'm starting to feel
like the dumb one.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.750
You're not the dumb one.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.172
Yes, I am, and you know it.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.942
And you really are
a genius, man.

41:33.950 --> 41:35.679
I'm just thinking
maybe you belong

41:35.690 --> 41:38.011
with your own kind,
you know, the nerds.

41:39.890 --> 41:41.881
<i>Are you trymg to White Fang me?
No.</i>

41:41.900 --> 41:44.722
Harry and the Hendersons.
You remember when John Lithgow,

41:44.730 --> 41:46.050
even though he loved
that sasquatch, man,

41:46.070 --> 41:47.822
he punched him right in the face

41:47.830 --> 41:49.719
to convince him
to move back to the woods

41:49.740 --> 41:51.230
and_ live with the other
Bigfoot creatures?

41:51.240 --> 41:55.529
Look, I don't want to work
at a lab at MIT, okay?

41:55.540 --> 41:57.770
(inhales sharply) I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

41:59.710 --> 42:01.269
(sighs) I want to
work with you.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.907
Is that what you
wanted to hear?

42:02.920 --> 42:03.910
Oh.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.948
You know, for a tough guy,
you sure do get emotional easy.

42:07.950 --> 42:10.146
That doesn't mean I won't whup
that ass for calling me a sissy.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.151
Uh, it's not even what I said.
That's what I heard.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.924
Well, you should
get your ears checked,

42:13.930 --> 42:15.250
'cause your arm's not the
only thing that's broken.

42:15.260 --> 42:17.149
Your face is broken.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.559
