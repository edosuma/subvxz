00:02.435 --> 00:04.426
Do you think
a little girl like Abagail...

00:04.504 --> 00:07.234
could be capable of murder?

00:07.307 --> 00:10.936
It was you who killed her, Abagail!
I didn't kill her!

00:11.011 --> 00:13.946
I'm coming!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.539
Sam, look out!

00:24.557 --> 00:28.550
<i>You two rabbits ought to be ashamed!</i>

00:28.628 --> 00:30.528
<i>The weddin'is tomorrow.!</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:33.088
You get him out of here.
You hear me, Abigail Fuller?

00:33.166 --> 00:35.464
Don Takins's boy's disappeared.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.935
<i>It looks like you're gonna have
a witch hunt on your hands.</i>

00:38.004 --> 00:41.030
Sam, look out!

00:41.107 --> 00:44.702
No! No!
She should die! No!

00:44.778 --> 00:48.976
Just know that
for this brief moment in time,

00:49.049 --> 00:51.347
we belong to each other.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.580
Please know that.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.213
I love you.

<i>"Baton Rouge Gazette.</i>

01:18.244 --> 01:20.769
<i>July 28, 1978. "</i>

01:20.847 --> 01:22.815
Louisiana.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.009
It wasn't over.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.283
My memory was fading, but in my soul
I knew it wasn't over.

01:29.355 --> 01:33.655
I was still in the South, and somehow
Abagail had summoned me back.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.751
But for what?

01:35.829 --> 01:39.026
And as who?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.159
Bo, the child has legal rights.
Wait a second. Wait a second.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.931
Larry Stanton?

01:45.004 --> 01:48.030
Hello, sweet cheeks.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.202
Come on over here,
you hot-blooded, Southern rebel,

01:51.277 --> 01:54.041
and melt me down.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.283
Tonight, Lawrence Stanton III,

01:58.351 --> 02:02.515
<i>I am Jane Fonda in Butterfeld 8.</i>

02:02.589 --> 02:04.523
Oh, boy.

03:20.333 --> 03:24.736
<i>I got a bad feelin' about this.</i>

03:24.804 --> 03:27.602
After 28 years of marriage,

03:27.674 --> 03:31.667
I know every feelin' you got.

03:31.744 --> 03:37.239
I'm your husband?
Well, of course you're my husband.

03:37.317 --> 03:42.721
Unless you wanna be
that wicked Blackbeard again.

03:43.957 --> 03:47.620
Why am I here?
Oh, no, you don't!

03:47.694 --> 03:50.754
Don't you start that.
Start what?

03:50.830 --> 03:53.560
That-That craziness about hearing voices.

03:53.633 --> 03:58.434
I don't wanna hear another word.
I heard voices?

03:58.504 --> 04:00.802
I said, not another word.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.137
But what do you mean-
That's it. That is it.

04:03.209 --> 04:07.578
<i>You have gone and done it. You have ruined
everything. I am no longer in the mood.</i>

04:07.647 --> 04:11.515
<i>So you can hang up your holsters
until next Saturday night.</i>

04:15.388 --> 04:18.357
- Aren't you gonna stop me?
- Stop you?

04:18.423 --> 04:22.120
<i>I'm callin' my mother!</i>

04:22.195 --> 04:26.359
- Oh, boy! - Sam, you're not gonna
believe this yo-yo in the waiting room.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.526
Larry Stanton?
Lawrence Stanton III, actually.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.504
You have a lucrative law practice
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

04:33.573 --> 04:36.474
and your counterpart
in the waiting room thinks he's dead.

04:36.542 --> 04:40.137
What? He thinks I'm St. Peter
and I'm gonna send him to hell...

04:40.213 --> 04:42.147
for overcharging his hours.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.410
Reminds me of my
last two divorce lawyers.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.282
Do you remember Larry Stanton?
Yeah.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.220
I mean, there were-

04:50.290 --> 04:52.281
I remember, uh,

04:54.627 --> 04:57.323
there was a hanging...

04:57.397 --> 04:59.957
and a lot people, and...

05:00.033 --> 05:03.093
he was hurt.

05:03.169 --> 05:08.630
I think he tried to save her.
Who? Her?

05:08.708 --> 05:12.838
No, no, no. Not her, not her. That's Mrs.
Larry Stanton. She wants to "melt me down. "

05:12.912 --> 05:16.871
Oh. Well, no wonder old Larry I would
rather go to hell than come back here.

05:16.949 --> 05:21.079
He's gonna be in big trouble if he comes
back here talking about heaven and angels,

05:21.154 --> 05:23.554
because Mrs. Larry
already thinks that he's nuts.

05:23.623 --> 05:27.855
Mrs. Larry-
Her name is Sherilyn Stanton.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.896
She's 51 years old, and she's
going through her second husband.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.421
She killed the first one
at the tender age of 17.

05:34.500 --> 05:39.301
And Ziggy says that she's gonna
bury the second one as well.

05:39.372 --> 05:43.206
Murder?
No. Heart attacks.

05:43.276 --> 05:47.212
Mr. Stanton the first was 77.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.374
Now, according to Ziggy,

05:50.450 --> 05:54.216
there's a 41- 41.12-

05:54.287 --> 05:56.346
43-point chance you're here-

05:56.422 --> 06:00.188
No, no, no. If you think I'm here to save
their marriage, Al, you can forget about that.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.854
<i>Well, actually, Ziggy hasn't
the slightest idea why you're here.</i>

06:03.930 --> 06:08.390
So I'd suggest you go open the door
and see what drifts in.

06:08.468 --> 06:12.268
Larry, will you please
answer the damn door!

06:12.338 --> 06:16.399
I am far too upset
to be entertaining guests.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.637
Don't look at me.
I don't make up these assignments.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.315
Hello.

06:47.740 --> 06:52.177
It's been a long time, Counselor.
A very long time.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.772
Would you like to, uh, come in?
No, it's-

06:55.848 --> 06:57.839
Be all right out here.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.149
You don't remember me.
It's Marie.

07:02.221 --> 07:04.155
<i>It's Marie from Pottersville.
Marie?</i>

07:04.223 --> 07:08.182
<i>Your brain is Swiss-cheesed, Sam.
Marie from Pottersville. Marie Billings.</i>

07:08.261 --> 07:10.786
Marie- Marie Billings.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.127
This is the woman
that used to work for Clayton Fuller.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.133
Abagail?
Yeah.

07:15.201 --> 07:19.137
I knew you didn't get my telegram.
Is Abagail all right?

07:19.205 --> 07:23.733
Well, I've been working for
that family for almost 30 years.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.371
Practically raised that child myself
after her daddy died.

07:27.447 --> 07:33.147
She didn't have no one else
after Henry died. Neither did I.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.621
What's happened to Abagail?

07:36.689 --> 07:38.987
They found those bones,

07:39.058 --> 07:43.085
and then there was that horrible murder.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.892
They're accusing Abagail of murder.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.900
That happened over 25 years ago.

07:48.968 --> 07:54.031
And the trial starts tomorrow. But
nobody would take it, Mr. Stanton. Nobody.

07:54.106 --> 07:57.735
She said maybe you?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.937
You were there for that horrible night,
and she said...

08:03.015 --> 08:05.916
only Will and you believed in her.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.614
<i>My husband doesn't take
charity cases anymore.</i>

08:09.689 --> 08:12.021
Besides, he is retired.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.753
No wonder Larry would rather stay dead.

08:14.827 --> 08:19.264
This is very important, Mrs. Stanton. You
remember Marie Billings from Pottersville.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.028
I said, my husband is retired.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.262
He has a very bad heart.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.567
Sam, Larry never took Abagail's case.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.869
But if you would just hear me out-
I have told you a million times.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.273
We don't have to work with
this kind of nigger trash anymore.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.868
<i>Ouch.!</i>

08:32.945 --> 08:34.741
Marie,

08:37.283 --> 08:41.219
I'd like to apologize
for what my wife just said.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.221
Will you excuse me for a moment?

08:46.792 --> 08:49.818
I'd like you to go inside
and make Marie and me some lemonade.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.830
And take your time.
But, Lawrence-

08:51.898 --> 08:53.559
Get inside.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.108
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Marie, I'm sorry.

09:04.176 --> 09:07.907
From the look of it, Miss Racist-in-a-Moo-Moo
could use a dose of trouble.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.073
Just sit down. I'm so sorry.

09:10.149 --> 09:14.779
Sam, maybe you're here
to see that Larry takes Abagail's case.

09:15.988 --> 09:20.789
<i>You remember that little Aider girl? Well, she
disappeared two years before you moved to town.</i>

09:20.860 --> 09:24.455
Folks thought that she was taken
by a pack of wild dogs.

09:24.530 --> 09:28.432
<i>Violet Aider's bones were discovered
sealed in the town well.</i>

09:28.501 --> 09:31.664
And everybody thought that Abagail-
Abagail didn't kill them.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.671
I can't believe this is really happening.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.505
You and I both know that.
After they got the bones out,

09:37.577 --> 09:41.570
Ms. Leta put together a case
with some lawyer-

09:41.647 --> 09:44.445
Denton Waters.
Ziggy says he's never lost a case.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.678
For something that happened
25 years ago?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.617
No, no, no. That was just it.

09:48.688 --> 09:53.682
The lawyer told Ms. Leta that
he couldn't try Abagail for Violet's murder.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.455
<i>Abagail is convicted of murder, Sam.</i>

09:56.529 --> 09:58.793
But she was eight years old.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.162
Ms. Leta was found...

10:01.233 --> 10:04.930
with her throat cut open
on Abagail's kitchen floor.

10:05.004 --> 10:09.464
Abagail is executed for the murder
of Leta Aider.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.949
Now don't go have a heart attack
on me, Mr. Stanton.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.719
Abagail needs your real bad.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.789
I'll go, uh,
pack my things, Marie.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.768
Now, we have to call Sheriff
Loman and tell him that... Right.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.305
You'll be up there this afternoon.
All right. I'll do that.

10:40.373 --> 10:44.400
You just sit down here, relax, and
I'll be out in a few minutes. Okay?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.002
Abagail said you would come.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.189
You're still in love with Abagail,
aren't you?

11:06.265 --> 11:08.995
I'm taking the case, Al.
Does history change?

11:09.068 --> 11:13.471
Not unless you do something
to change it.

11:13.539 --> 11:18.567
Abagail Fuller dies in the
electric chair June 30, 1984.

11:27.119 --> 11:31.055
<i>Little Violet Aider had waited
25 years for someone to find her.</i>

11:31.123 --> 11:33.284
<i>And finally, they had.</i>

11:33.359 --> 11:35.884
<i>Leta had come after Abagail
with a vengeance,</i>

11:35.961 --> 11:40.364
<i>desperately trying to mount a case
that would send her to the electric chair.</i>

11:40.433 --> 11:42.458
<i>But now Leta was dead,
and I knew that fate...</i>

11:42.535 --> 11:45.265
<i>had brought me back into Abagail's life...</i>

11:45.337 --> 11:48.204
<i>to prove her innocence
once and for all.</i>

11:50.342 --> 11:53.243
<i>All right. Let me see those files.
I'll be out of your way.</i>

11:53.312 --> 11:55.746
<i>You got it.
There he is.</i>

11:55.815 --> 12:00.582
<i>Hey, Stanton. How come I'm
so young, and you got so old?</i>

12:00.653 --> 12:02.951
- Good to see you again, Bo.
- Good to see you.

12:03.022 --> 12:06.924
- This is Denton Waters. He's the special prosecutor for the State.
- Mr. Waters.

12:06.992 --> 12:10.587
Mr. Stanton. I understand
you used to live around these parts.

12:10.663 --> 12:15.464
<i>Yeah. Moved away in '66 right after that
incident with the Takins boy gettin'lost.</i>

12:15.534 --> 12:19.903
- What incident was that?
- Oh, couple townsfolks decided to take the law in their own hands.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.566
- They were gonna string up Abagail.
- Is that so?

12:22.641 --> 12:25.508
<i>As I recall, Leta Aider
was one of the main instigators.</i>

12:25.578 --> 12:30.675
Larry packed up his bags and his wife
and kids and left damn near the next day.

12:30.750 --> 12:35.551
Mr. Stanton said he had no intentions of letting
his family grow up in a town that was so backwards,

12:35.621 --> 12:40.251
it was capable of lynchin'
one of its own.

12:42.428 --> 12:46.762
Um, I always admired you
for that.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.096
Mrs. Kinman?

12:49.168 --> 12:52.160
"Kinman"? There's a name
I haven't heard in a long time.

12:52.238 --> 12:55.469
It's still Fuller. Yeah, Will and
Abagail never quite made it to the altar.

12:55.541 --> 13:01.002
If you don't mind, I would prefer to
discuss my past with Mr. Stanton myself.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.140
I thought he'd rather hear it from me
than get an earful from the Potter parish.

13:04.216 --> 13:08.152
I don't think that Miss Fuller's marital status
has any relevance to this trial, does it?

13:08.220 --> 13:13.487
Neither does my bein' here. I'm sure you two
have a great deal to discuss before tomorrow.

13:13.559 --> 13:16.687
- Yeah, starting with a continuance.
- I'm afraid we've had two already.

13:16.762 --> 13:18.662
A third is out of the question.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.995
L- I'm sorry.
Have you, uh-

13:21.066 --> 13:23.125
Mr. Waters and I have already met.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.171
<i>Well, I'll need to see
the rest of those files.</i>

13:26.238 --> 13:28.263
Oh, and make sure that
Mr. Stanton has copies.

13:28.340 --> 13:32.572
We wouldn't want him to declare
a mistrial for lack of disclosure.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.781
Stanton, why don't you
go ahead and use my office?

13:37.850 --> 13:40.045
Take as much time as you want to.

13:41.887 --> 13:45.550
Jim Bob's gonna be outside,
and the file's on the desk.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.864
I'm very glad you came,
Mr. Stanton.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.996
I never should have left.

14:05.511 --> 14:10.949
There aren't any hotels in town, so I
told Marie you'd be staying at the house.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.416
Yes, thank you.
She, uh- She told me-

14:13.485 --> 14:16.181
Would you mind taking these home for
me? They're just a bunch of bills.

14:16.255 --> 14:19.554
But right now,
they seem kind of unimportant.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.628
Sorry about what happened
with you and Will.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.865
Oh.
Would you mind tellin' me?

14:36.141 --> 14:41.044
There's not much to tell,
but, uh-

14:41.113 --> 14:44.082
It was just one moment, we were very
much in love and getting married.

14:44.149 --> 14:48.848
And the next, he moved out west
to write a book.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.922
I hear he's doing real well.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.930
What else do you wanna know,
Mr. Stanton?

15:02.301 --> 15:06.567
How I'm gonna stretch 15 hours into
three weeks to get ready for your trial.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.268
- Should I be afraid, Mr. Stanton?
- Only if you're guilty.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.607
Well, I didn't kill Leta Aider.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.613
Do you believe me?

15:15.681 --> 15:17.512
Yes, I do.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.122
Now, you wanna tell me what happened?

15:27.393 --> 15:32.228
Well, it was a little after 3:00
on Tuesday.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.799
I'd just been to the market
to get a few things, and, uh-

15:36.869 --> 15:41.806
<i>I came straight home and I went to
the kitchen to put the groceries away.</i>

15:43.309 --> 15:45.800
<i>And then I saw Leta.</i>

15:45.878 --> 15:49.279
<i>Were there any signs of a struggle?
The whole place was a mess.</i>

15:49.348 --> 15:52.613
<i>- So you phoned the police?
- No.</i>

15:52.685 --> 15:55.677
No, no, I didn't.
L-

15:55.754 --> 16:01.454
I was just standin' there
lookin' at Leta in all that blood.

16:03.729 --> 16:07.722
And then, uh,
Bo Loman showed up and said...

16:07.800 --> 16:13.466
that he'd gotten a call from someone
that said they heard a woman screamin'.

16:13.539 --> 16:16.838
Your first attorney wanted you
to plead self-defense.

16:16.909 --> 16:20.174
I didn't kill her.

16:20.245 --> 16:24.944
Denton Waters was approached
prior to the death of Leta Aider...

16:25.017 --> 16:28.748
to come up with a case against you
for the murder of Violet...

16:28.821 --> 16:31.016
and for the murder of her father,
Bart Aider.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.854
I know. They're supposed
to exhume Bart's body tomorrow.

16:33.926 --> 16:38.727
Abagail, didn't you know that...

16:38.797 --> 16:42.255
no matter how much evidence
they got together to bring you to trial...

16:42.334 --> 16:47.829
that they couldn't because the crimes
were committed when you were a minor?

16:47.906 --> 16:51.273
I remember that day
Violet disappeared so clear.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.709
<i>And yet,
sometimes I feel-</i>

16:55.647 --> 16:58.081
Well, everyone else was so sure.

17:00.152 --> 17:03.417
Maybe I remembered what I wanted.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.251
Maybe-

17:08.327 --> 17:11.022
I wanted to hold her.

17:11.096 --> 17:15.964
Tell her, "You're not crazy.
You didn't kill anyone. "

17:16.035 --> 17:19.936
But I wanted more.
With Abagail, I always wanted more.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.996
You all right?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.483
Yes, I am.

17:36.822 --> 17:40.314
Strange.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.384
It was just for a moment, you-

17:44.496 --> 17:46.430
In your eyes-

17:48.600 --> 17:53.902
I, uh, don't believe that you killed Violet.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.371
<i>Who discovered, uh,
Violet's remains?</i>

17:58.444 --> 18:00.935
Restoration crew.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.949
They were tearing down the old well, and one
of the workmen dropped his watch or something.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.542
Went down to get it,
and found the skeleton.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.815
Funny, the games fate plays.

18:13.892 --> 18:18.920
<i>I imagine that was enough to get Leta
Aider started again. Oh, she never stopped.</i>

18:18.997 --> 18:22.694
Not really. I mean,
all she needed was Violet's locket,

18:22.768 --> 18:24.736
and the case would be complete.

18:24.803 --> 18:28.398
<i>Abagail, I need you
to remember everything...</i>

18:28.474 --> 18:31.307
about the day that Violet disappeared...

18:31.376 --> 18:33.810
and about Bart and about Leta.

18:33.879 --> 18:39.681
- Why? - Because I need to know
everything about your past- good or bad.

18:39.751 --> 18:43.152
<i>Why don't we start with Violet?</i>

18:43.222 --> 18:46.123
Well,

18:47.493 --> 18:52.260
I can't really say that
we were friends, Violet and I.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.164
I guess we were rivals.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.861
She, uh-

18:58.937 --> 19:03.237
She used to tease me... all the time.

19:06.378 --> 19:09.211
Then that day- that day,
she was tauntin' me...

19:09.281 --> 19:11.215
about a little gold locket...

19:11.283 --> 19:15.583
that I'd been saving up for,
but I couldn't afford.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.852
Just to spite me, she bought it.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.257
She kept pushin' it in my face,

19:22.327 --> 19:25.524
<i>saying that my family was poor
and that we were crazy.</i>

19:25.597 --> 19:29.693
<i>So I hit her.
She laughed harder, so I hit her harder.</i>

19:29.768 --> 19:33.260
<i>Her nose started to bleed on her sweater,
and she started crying.</i>

19:33.338 --> 19:38.640
<i>And I just kept hittin'her and hittin'her
and hittin'her. It was like I couldn't stop.</i>

19:38.710 --> 19:44.114
<i>When I finally did stop, she ran off,
said she was gonna tell her mother.</i>

19:46.718 --> 19:50.950
I did not like Violet,

19:51.023 --> 19:52.957
but I didn't kill her.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.186
I'm not a killer.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.564
I didn't kill her.

20:22.688 --> 20:26.021
<i>Abagail and I talked
for another three hours.</i>

20:26.091 --> 20:28.958
<i>She told me about Violet and Bart...</i>

20:29.027 --> 20:31.894
<i>and how she had been there
when they died,:</i>

20:31.964 --> 20:34.398
<i>About her mother and her grandmother.</i>

20:34.466 --> 20:37.958
<i>Each story brought back
more memories of Abagail.</i>

20:38.036 --> 20:40.129
<i>Somehow,
in my Swiss cheese brain,</i>

20:40.205 --> 20:42.469
<i>every moment I had spent
leaping into Abagail's life...</i>

20:42.541 --> 20:45.533
<i>was as clear as if
it had happened yesterday.</i>

20:46.778 --> 20:49.576
<i>Gonna save her?</i>

20:49.648 --> 20:51.741
Are you gonna save my mommy?

20:53.885 --> 20:58.345
- Abagail?
- Abagail's my mother.

20:58.423 --> 21:02.120
Your mother?
But she said that Will-

21:02.194 --> 21:05.322
Mary Beth said you can't help her.
Mary Beth said...

21:05.397 --> 21:08.696
<i>that thejudge was gonna take
her tojail, and they were gonna-</i>

21:08.767 --> 21:11.634
Come here.
Nobody's gonna hurt your mother.

21:11.703 --> 21:14.501
But Mary Beth said
that they were gonna-

21:14.573 --> 21:17.440
Look. I don't care
what Mary Beth said.

21:17.509 --> 21:20.706
I'm not about to let
anybody hurt your mother.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.804
You mean that?

21:22.881 --> 21:25.349
With all my heart.

21:25.417 --> 21:30.719
You know, I came from very far away...

21:30.789 --> 21:32.723
to help your mother.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.954
And I don't think I would have been
brought here if I couldn't do the job.

21:39.031 --> 21:43.798
So why don't you dry
those pretty eyes,

21:43.869 --> 21:48.670
and, um, let's not worry
about any of this a bit, okay?

21:51.176 --> 21:54.612
What's your name?
Sam.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.978
<i>Larry Stanton.</i>

21:57.049 --> 22:00.576
What's yours?
SammyJo.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.586
<i>Samantha Josephine Fuller.</i>

22:02.654 --> 22:07.421
I'm very, very glad you're here,
Mr. Sam Larry Stanton. Very glad.

22:07.492 --> 22:11.861
<i>Uh, Sam, Ziggy says
you're not herejust to save Abagail.</i>

22:11.930 --> 22:15.366
You're here to save SammyJo.

22:15.434 --> 22:19.530
<i>There's a 91.9% chance that...</i>

22:19.604 --> 22:23.700
SammyJo Fuller is your daughter.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.942
<i>According to Ziggy,</i>

22:32.017 --> 22:36.044
she has an I.Q. Of 194.

22:36.121 --> 22:39.113
So she got her brains
from her father.

22:39.191 --> 22:45.061
But the tragedy in all of this is that she's so
traumatized by the death of her mother that she drops out.

22:45.130 --> 22:48.657
She's living alone
in Mobile right now.

22:48.734 --> 22:52.135
She's writing computer manuals
for some rinky-dink little company.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.570
- No.
- "No" what?

22:58.176 --> 23:02.545
No way am I gonna get busted...

23:02.614 --> 23:05.082
for keeping a 10-year-old kid
up so late.

23:05.150 --> 23:08.449
I'm not 10. I'm 11.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.457
And you're not keeping me up. I'm
waitin' for Marie to wake up so we can go.

23:13.525 --> 23:17.154
Where are you going? Yeah, you
know, I think it's kinda creepy, uh-

23:17.229 --> 23:21.427
Just to Marie's. You know, for a kid to
stay in a place where dead people were.

23:21.500 --> 23:25.459
<i>I'm staying with her till
Mommy comes home. Lordy.</i>

23:25.537 --> 23:28.370
We all gonna turn into pumpkins.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.170
I gotta get you home, child.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.837
I see you met our SammyJo.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.507
Smartest little girl
in the whole parish.

23:37.582 --> 23:41.484
I put up some chicken and rice for you,
Mr. Stanton, in the kitchen.

23:41.553 --> 23:45.990
You want me to warm it?
You better get her home, huh?

23:46.057 --> 23:48.423
SammyJo, why don't you run in the
kitchen and pull that plate out-

23:48.493 --> 23:52.623
No! I can't go in there!
Please don't make me go in there.

23:52.697 --> 23:55.461
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.</i>

23:55.534 --> 23:58.128
I didn't know what
I was thinkin' about, baby.

23:58.203 --> 24:01.832
Your Marie is just
gettin' old and forgetful.

24:01.907 --> 24:06.207
Now, I'll get you outta here
and in a nice, warm bed.

24:06.278 --> 24:11.409
She's probably right. If you, you
know, put on some nice pajamas...

24:11.483 --> 24:15.510
and get in a big, warm bed,
you'll have a good night's sleep.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.388
Will I see you tomorrow,
Mr. Stanton?

24:22.461 --> 24:26.488
Now, SammyJo, I don't want you
anywhere near that courthouse.

24:26.565 --> 24:29.466
I'll be here every day after 5:00.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.432
And I can come see you?

24:36.107 --> 24:38.473
I'd be sad if you don't.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.079
Good night.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.138
Come on, honey.

24:47.953 --> 24:50.444
<i>I have a daughter, Al.</i>

24:56.261 --> 24:58.752
<i>Now there were two people I had to save-</i>

24:58.830 --> 25:02.163
<i>Abagail and our daughter, SammyJo.</i>

25:02.234 --> 25:04.828
<i>And even from her grave,
Leta held the key.</i>

25:04.903 --> 25:08.703
<i>Mr. Stanton, would you care
to address thejury?</i>

25:08.773 --> 25:11.537
<i>Uh, yes. Well, firstly-
firstly, there's no proof...</i>

25:11.610 --> 25:16.172
that Abagail killed
either Violet or her father.

25:17.782 --> 25:22.981
First of all, I would like
to clear up some of the clutter...

25:23.054 --> 25:26.820
that Mr. Waters has thrown
in your way about this trial.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.421
We are here for one reason
and one reason only-

25:32.497 --> 25:35.989
<i>to determine the guilt or innocence
of Abagail Fuller...</i>

25:36.067 --> 25:38.729
with regards to
the murder of Leta Aider.

25:38.803 --> 25:42.170
<i>Now, since Mr. Waters brought this up,</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:46.904
<i>I feel I must remind you all
that it has never been proven that...</i>

25:46.978 --> 25:49.947
Abagail Fuller committed murder.

25:50.015 --> 25:52.916
It has never been proven
that Abagail Fuller...

25:52.984 --> 25:56.852
<i>took the lives of Violet
or her father.</i>

25:58.456 --> 26:02.415
Now, that fact haunted Leta Aider.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.485
<i>It haunted her...</i>

26:04.563 --> 26:08.294
because she desperately needed
someone to blame...

26:08.366 --> 26:11.631
for the loss of her family.

26:11.703 --> 26:17.005
Now, I do not know why
Leta's family was taken from her,

26:17.075 --> 26:22.012
but I do know that my client,
Abagail Fuller, was not responsible.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.674
<i>Well, she had no motive to kill Leta.</i>

26:24.749 --> 26:27.445
<i>And-And because she is innocent-</i>

26:27.519 --> 26:30.613
And even if she did, she wouldn't be
responsible because she just was a minor.

26:30.689 --> 26:35.991
Since she did not kill Violet or Bart,
she would have no reason to murder Leta-

26:36.061 --> 26:39.121
no motive to murder Leta Aider.

26:39.197 --> 26:42.030
Now, Mr. Waters omitted the fact...

26:42.100 --> 26:44.500
<i>that by statute,</i>

26:44.569 --> 26:48.437
the state of Louisiana cannot
convict a minor of a felony.

26:48.506 --> 26:51.998
That's if she committed a felony,
which she did not.

26:52.077 --> 26:57.037
Why would this woman
jeopardize her life...

26:57.115 --> 26:59.015
<i>and the life ofher daughter?</i>

26:59.084 --> 27:02.315
The answer is... she would not.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.548
Yeah. They're barking up
the wrong oak.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.786
There is a murderer and a killer-

27:07.859 --> 27:10.987
<i>a killer who came into
Abagail's kitchen...</i>

27:11.062 --> 27:13.792
and, for whatever reason,
took the life of Leta Aider.

27:13.865 --> 27:17.801
A crime was committed,
but not by this woman.

27:17.869 --> 27:20.030
Now, you,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

27:20.105 --> 27:22.403
have a very difficult task
ahead of you here.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.739
<i>You have to throw out...</i>

27:25.810 --> 27:29.712
the rumors and the gossip
and the lies...

27:29.781 --> 27:35.310
<i>that have followed Abagail Fuller for the
past 25 years and listen only to the facts.</i>

27:35.387 --> 27:38.379
And using that knowledge,
and that knowledge only,

27:38.456 --> 27:42.722
<i>you must determine
the guilt or innocence...</i>

27:42.794 --> 27:45.592
<i>of Abagail Fuller.</i>

27:45.664 --> 27:48.963
You must determine her fate...

27:49.034 --> 27:53.334
and the future of her daughter...

27:53.405 --> 27:55.373
and everyone else who loves her.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.034
<i>Sam, are you okay?</i>

27:58.109 --> 28:01.237
I will do my best
to present the facts...

28:01.312 --> 28:05.248
<i>as I know them, as will Mr. Waters.</i>

28:05.316 --> 28:09.252
And it will be up to you...

28:09.320 --> 28:11.254
<i>to determine-
Sam?</i>

28:11.322 --> 28:13.415
The truth.

28:15.794 --> 28:19.252
<i>Thank you.
Are you all right?</i>

28:19.330 --> 28:22.060
Sam, I don't like the way you
look here. Are you all right?

28:22.133 --> 28:24.260
What's goin' on?

28:24.335 --> 28:26.496
I'm all right.
I just need a moment.

28:26.571 --> 28:32.203
Sam, there's a problem in the waiting
room. Tell them you need a break.

28:32.277 --> 28:36.236
Your Honor, if I could just
have a moment, please?

28:36.314 --> 28:38.782
The court will take
a 20-minute recess...

28:38.850 --> 28:41.717
before we bring in
the prosecution's first witness.

28:43.154 --> 28:47.648
<i>I had found Stanton's nitro pills
in his briefcase and taken them.</i>

28:47.726 --> 28:51.594
<i>They had made the pain in my chest subside enough
to make it through the first day of witnesses.</i>

28:51.663 --> 28:54.723
<i>I listened as Denton presented...</i>

28:54.799 --> 28:58.098
<i>a variety of experts
and a ton of evidence-</i>

28:58.169 --> 29:03.607
<i>the knife that killed Leta with Abagail's
fingerprints on it, as well as Leta's,:</i>

29:03.675 --> 29:08.078
<i>Bo and his recount of finding Abagail
standing over Leta's body,</i>

29:08.146 --> 29:11.377
<i>adding his memories
of Violet and Bart.</i>

29:11.449 --> 29:15.579
<i>And now, I had to face the one other
person whose future depended on me.</i>

29:24.896 --> 29:26.887
SammyJo?

29:30.268 --> 29:32.259
SammyJo, you all right?

29:33.271 --> 29:36.434
<i>Brigadoon.
What?</i>

29:36.508 --> 29:39.341
I was just rememberin'.

29:39.410 --> 29:44.438
See, when I read a book,
the pages,

29:44.516 --> 29:47.815
they stay like pictures
in my mind.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.252
Whenever I want to,
I can just go back...

29:50.321 --> 29:54.087
and remember it all over again.

29:54.159 --> 29:57.651
You've got a photographic memory.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.822
Sometimes.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.266
I've got a photographic memory.

30:04.335 --> 30:06.963
<i>You do?
Mm-hmm.</i>

30:09.140 --> 30:12.667
<i>Brigadoon. Brigadoon.
That was one of my favorite stories too.</i>

30:12.744 --> 30:18.410
Mine too. My grandmama said she likes it
when the old reverend asked God for a miracle.

30:18.483 --> 30:22.544
And he makes Brigadoon
disappear for a hundred years.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.679
What's your favorite part?

30:26.591 --> 30:30.357
I like when Tommy calls
the whole village back through time...

30:30.428 --> 30:33.591
because he loves Fiona so much
that he can't live without her.

30:35.533 --> 30:39.867
Do you believe in miracles,
Mr. Stanton? Miracles?

30:41.272 --> 30:46.039
Someone,
if they really loved somebody,

30:46.110 --> 30:50.570
could go back in time
and be part of their lives?

30:52.150 --> 30:55.176
Well, if that's a miracle,
then yes, I believe in miracles.

30:55.253 --> 30:58.518
I wanna go back in time someday.
You do?

30:59.924 --> 31:03.382
I wanna meet my daddy.
I wanna tell him-

31:03.461 --> 31:07.090
Tell him what?
It doesn't matter.

31:07.165 --> 31:10.931
Sure it does.
It- It matters.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.596
Just that I love him.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.606
But he knows.
My grandmama Fuller says so,

31:19.677 --> 31:23.078
and she knows everything.

31:23.147 --> 31:25.445
Laura?
What's the matter?

31:28.353 --> 31:31.447
SammyJo Fuller,

31:31.522 --> 31:34.616
I love you,

31:34.692 --> 31:37.320
and I want you to know
that everything's gonna be okay.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.468
Where are you goin'?

31:48.539 --> 31:53.499
I'm gonna go tell your grandmama
that it's okay to remember.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.085
Sam.
Al.

32:10.161 --> 32:13.289
Wait a minute. You gotta take it easy
for a while. What are you talking about?

32:13.364 --> 32:16.231
I'm talking about
- Do you remember today in court when you were upset?

32:16.301 --> 32:20.032
Yeah. Well, Stanton had a mild seizure
in the waiting room at the same time.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.767
You seem to have a mental and physical
connection with him on this leap.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.900
I don't know why.
Okay, but I feel fine right now.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.911
If you wanna have a massive coronary,
that's okay.

32:27.979 --> 32:32.006
But Ziggy says if not, you gotta take it
easy and keep Stanton's medicine next to you.

32:32.083 --> 32:34.881
<i>My advice is maybe you shouldjust
take it easy for a while.</i>

32:34.953 --> 32:37.615
The only way I can find out the
truth is to talk to Laura. Okay?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.623
I gotta talk to her.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.022
Hello, Laura.
You don't know me.

32:47.098 --> 32:51.626
My name is Larry Stanton,
and I'm here to help your daughter.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.137
Abagail?

32:54.205 --> 32:55.866
Yes.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.142
Is Abagail in trouble?

32:59.210 --> 33:01.542
Yes, she is.

33:01.612 --> 33:06.072
Well, that's why she hasn't
been to see me in a long time.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.914
She's in very bad trouble,

33:08.987 --> 33:14.357
and she needs for you to remember
something from the past.

33:14.425 --> 33:17.826
No. I don't have to remember.

33:17.895 --> 33:20.329
It's just a bad dream.

33:20.398 --> 33:24.198
When I wake up, it'll all be gone away.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.202
That's what Mama used to say.

33:26.270 --> 33:30.206
Uh, Sam, no.
She's not firing on all six cylinders.

33:30.274 --> 33:33.243
She's all I've got.
I know, but if she testifies,

33:33.311 --> 33:36.212
Denton Waters will
have her declared non compos mentis.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.010
All I need her to remember is what
happened the night Violet disappeared.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.017
That's it, Al.
I know.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.054
But if they think she's crazy,
then they'll disqualify her testimony.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.056
I remember you.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.492
You were here...

33:55.033 --> 33:57.126
a very long time ago.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.761
You were gonna marry my Abagail.

33:59.837 --> 34:03.295
But you didn't. You went away.
Well, you broke her heart, you know.

34:03.374 --> 34:08.038
I think you've mistaken
me for someone else. No.

34:08.112 --> 34:12.572
I've been waiting for you
for a very long time.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.641
Very long time.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.416
<i>Clayton said that you'd come.</i>

34:18.489 --> 34:22.619
And then,
I'd have to tell about Violet.

34:22.693 --> 34:26.958
- Bingo!
- Clayton- He knew that.

34:39.377 --> 34:42.641
She wanted that locket so much.

34:42.713 --> 34:46.114
<i>So very, very much.</i>

34:47.851 --> 34:49.786
Clayton wouldn't let her have it,

34:49.853 --> 34:52.288
but I kept it.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.754
I kept it and all of its secrets.

35:06.871 --> 35:09.362
Oh, God.

35:20.618 --> 35:24.179
<i>Laura came to court that morning
with the support ofher doctor,</i>

35:24.255 --> 35:27.281
<i>who said her confinement
had been self-inflicted for years.</i>

35:27.358 --> 35:29.792
<i>She said Clayton had forbidden her
to tell her story.</i>

35:29.861 --> 35:33.297
<i>But today, after 25 years,
she told.</i>

35:33.364 --> 35:37.357
<i>I was trying to buy candles...</i>

35:37.435 --> 35:40.370
<i>fore the storm,</i>

35:40.438 --> 35:42.668
<i>but the general store was closed.</i>

35:42.740 --> 35:48.508
<i>Everybody had gone home
to lash their windows and cellars.</i>

35:48.579 --> 35:53.573
<i>Then I saw Violet
walking across the town square.</i>

35:53.651 --> 35:57.052
<i>She was upset.
She was angry and crying,</i>

35:57.121 --> 36:00.181
<i>and there was blood on her face...</i>

36:00.258 --> 36:02.556
and on her little white sweater.

36:02.627 --> 36:05.721
<i>I ran to her
to see if she was all right.</i>

36:05.796 --> 36:10.563
<i>But before I could say much,
she started screaming at me about Abagail.</i>

36:10.635 --> 36:15.868
<i>She said Abagail was mean and crazy
and that she had hit her.</i>

36:15.940 --> 36:18.773
I tried to calm her-

36:20.845 --> 36:23.006
calm her down,

36:24.482 --> 36:28.543
but she said she was gonna
go tell her mama.

36:28.619 --> 36:31.611
<i>Violet was glad
that Abagail had hit her...</i>

36:31.689 --> 36:34.852
<i>because now everybody would know
that Abagail was crazy...</i>

36:34.926 --> 36:37.258
and they would lock her away forever.

36:37.328 --> 36:41.697
<i>I pleaded with her,
but she ran away.</i>

36:41.766 --> 36:47.432
<i>I ran after her and I-I grabbed her.</i>

36:47.505 --> 36:50.030
<i>I was trying to talk to her.</i>

36:50.107 --> 36:55.443
<i>She was in a rage,
and she tore herself from my hands.</i>

36:55.513 --> 36:57.572
<i>She fell away from me,</i>

36:57.648 --> 37:01.550
<i>and she fell through the old planks
that covered the well.</i>

37:01.619 --> 37:05.521
I reached out for her,

37:05.590 --> 37:10.653
but I only caught the little gold locket
that was around her neck.

37:10.728 --> 37:14.061
<i>It broke.
The chain snapped.</i>

37:16.200 --> 37:18.964
Violet was gone.

37:20.137 --> 37:22.731
<i>She's gone.</i>

37:22.807 --> 37:26.834
You expect the court to believe
that Violet's death was an accident?

37:26.911 --> 37:29.402
And that Bart Aider
had a heart attack.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.914
- Mr. Waters?
- I object.

37:31.983 --> 37:36.613
<i>Counsel is trying to take a woman who's
been institutionalized for 20 years...</i>

37:36.687 --> 37:39.349
<i>and get her to take
the responsibility for all of'em.</i>

37:39.423 --> 37:41.914
And Leta-
Did you kill Leta Aider too?

37:41.993 --> 37:46.225
Mr. Waters, you will have a chance
to cross-examine the witness.

37:46.297 --> 37:50.529
Laura, did you kill Leta Aider?

37:50.601 --> 37:53.866
<i>No.</i>

37:53.938 --> 37:58.966
<i>Order in this court.! One more such eruption,
and I will have this courtroom cleared.</i>

37:59.043 --> 38:02.877
Mr. Stanton, just where is
this line of questioning leading?

38:02.947 --> 38:06.348
I wanna prove to the court
that Abagail Fuller...

38:06.417 --> 38:11.684
was innocent of the history that this town has
branded her with for the past 25 years, Your Honor.

38:11.756 --> 38:14.782
And-

38:14.859 --> 38:17.555
Now, I would like to...

38:19.463 --> 38:21.397
show the court why...

38:21.465 --> 38:26.129
<i>she didn't kill Leta Aider.</i>

38:26.203 --> 38:30.230
Sam, uh-
Yeah, take one of your pills.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.375
<i>Counselor, are you all right?</i>

38:46.223 --> 38:48.487
- I'm gonna put her on the stand.
- What for?

38:48.559 --> 38:52.154
Your Honor, I would like to call
Abagail... Fuller to the stand.

38:52.229 --> 38:56.063
But Mr. Waters hasn't had a chance
to cross-examine this witness.

38:56.133 --> 38:59.000
He may not have to, Your Honor,
if you let me bring her on the stand.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.004
I don't wanna cross-examine her.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.063
I want her testimony
stricken from the record...

39:03.140 --> 39:05.506
<i>and declared non compos mentis.!</i>

39:05.576 --> 39:08.010
I know who killed Leta Aider,
Your Honor.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.070
- You do?
- Objection!

39:10.147 --> 39:13.014
<i>Please, Your Honor.
I won't be wasting the court's time.</i>

39:13.084 --> 39:17.020
- Let me put Abagail Fuller on the stand.
- Overruled.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.680
<i>Counselor, call your witness.</i>

39:18.756 --> 39:22.214
The defense calls...

39:22.293 --> 39:24.227
Abagail Fuller.

39:24.295 --> 39:28.254
<i>Ms. Fuller, you may step down.
Bailiff will show you where to sit.</i>

39:33.237 --> 39:35.228
Just tell the truth.

39:36.774 --> 39:40.471
<i>Do you-state your name-
Sam, do you know what you're doing?</i>

39:40.544 --> 39:42.512
Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

39:42.580 --> 39:44.605
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

39:44.682 --> 39:47.276
I do.

39:50.988 --> 39:53.718
Miss Fuller, would you be kind enough
to tell to the court...

39:53.791 --> 39:57.784
the events that transpired
the afternoon of May the 15th...

39:57.862 --> 39:59.887
when you returned home?

39:59.964 --> 40:03.798
I came home at about 3:15.
I had just been to the grocery store.

40:03.868 --> 40:08.237
My arms were full, so I entered the house
and went straight back to the kitchen.

40:08.305 --> 40:09.897
And what did you see in the kitchen?

40:09.974 --> 40:14.035
It was torn up.
There were broken dishes...

40:14.111 --> 40:18.070
and food thrown on the walls
like someone had a tantrum.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.174
And what else did you see?

40:21.318 --> 40:23.718
Blood.

40:23.788 --> 40:28.657
There was a... large pool of blood.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.856
Whose blood?
Leta Aider's.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.864
I didn't see her body at first.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.366
<i>Then I walked around the table,
and she was there.</i>

40:37.435 --> 40:39.630
And where was the knife, Abagail?

40:39.703 --> 40:42.433
<i>Do you remember where the knife was
in relationship to the body?</i>

40:42.506 --> 40:45.168
Right near Leta, I guess.

40:45.242 --> 40:48.507
Um, a few inches away
from the body.

40:48.579 --> 40:51.013
And, uh, then what happened?

40:52.283 --> 40:55.275
I was afraid to move.

40:58.088 --> 41:01.182
I wanted to cry out for help,
but I couldn't.

41:01.258 --> 41:04.386
So you didn't call the police,

41:04.462 --> 41:09.559
you didn't call the doctors, or-

41:09.633 --> 41:12.397
When I looked up,
Bo was standing at the backdoor.

41:12.470 --> 41:16.031
<i>Bo was at the backdoor
because somebody had called him?</i>

41:16.106 --> 41:21.703
He said someone said they heard a woman
screaming from my house and called it in.

41:25.115 --> 41:27.982
- What are these?
- Bills.

41:28.052 --> 41:31.021
Sam, do you know where
you're going with this?

41:31.088 --> 41:35.320
<i>- Counsel is wasting the court's time.
- Please, Your Honor.</i>

41:35.392 --> 41:37.883
Mr. Waters.

41:37.962 --> 41:42.023
I'd like you to open
your phone bill from May...

41:42.099 --> 41:44.158
and see if you recognize
any of the phone numbers...

41:44.235 --> 41:47.671
<i>that were dialed on
the afternoon of the 15th.</i>

41:52.209 --> 41:55.269
Oakdell-65234.
That's the sheriff's office.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.405
And what time was that call made?

41:59.583 --> 42:02.746
2:53.
A full 22 minutes before you got home.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.685
<i>Objection.!</i>

42:04.755 --> 42:06.985
You have no proof that
she wasn't there earlier.

42:07.057 --> 42:11.551
<i>I have a store full of people and the time
it takes to get from there to her home.</i>

42:11.629 --> 42:14.029
Objection overruled.

42:14.098 --> 42:17.363
<i>On May 15, 1978,</i>

42:17.434 --> 42:20.870
as Mr. Waters told us yesterday,

42:20.938 --> 42:24.237
<i>the day that he explained
to Mrs. Aider...</i>

42:24.308 --> 42:28.108
that based on Louisiana statutes
for the protection of minors,

42:28.178 --> 42:31.238
<i>she had no case
against Abagail Fuller.</i>

42:31.315 --> 42:36.912
Even though they had found the bones of her
daughter, Violet, at the bottom of a well,

42:36.987 --> 42:38.978
<i>she had no case.</i>

42:39.056 --> 42:40.717
<i>Can you imagine how she felt?</i>

42:40.791 --> 42:45.057
After 25 years of waiting and hoping...

42:45.129 --> 42:49.657
and praying for
some shred of proof to turn up...

42:49.733 --> 42:52.065
<i>that could verify what
she had believed all along,</i>

42:52.136 --> 42:57.403
it finally turns up,
and she is told that it doesn't matter.

42:59.310 --> 43:02.108
I believe that at that point,

43:02.179 --> 43:05.740
Leta Aider became incensed.

43:05.816 --> 43:10.014
And full of rage, she came to
Abagail's house to confront her.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.578
<i>But Abagail was not there.</i>

43:12.656 --> 43:17.787
<i>And her rage and her frustration grew.</i>

43:17.861 --> 43:23.800
She tore apart Abagail's kitchen
looking for some measure of revenge...

43:23.867 --> 43:28.167
to fill all the years of hatred
that had consumed her.

43:28.238 --> 43:32.538
<i>And finally,
feeling she had no other recourse...</i>

43:32.610 --> 43:35.943
<i>and from some dark
and horrible place in her mind,</i>

43:36.013 --> 43:38.777
<i>she picked up
Abagail's kitchen knife,</i>

43:38.849 --> 43:43.684
a knife that she knew would have
Abagail's fingerprints on it,

43:43.754 --> 43:47.781
Just like... Laura's mother.

43:47.858 --> 43:50.122
And she slit her own throat.

43:50.194 --> 43:51.957
Objection!

43:52.029 --> 43:54.293
<i>This is unadulterated conjecture!
Order in this court.!</i>

43:54.365 --> 43:57.801
<i>- Bailiff, clear this courtroom!
- This is conjecture.!</i>

43:57.868 --> 44:01.360
- This witness-
- I want order, and I want it now!

44:01.438 --> 44:04.202
Abagail Fuller murdered Leta Aider!

44:04.274 --> 44:07.402
No!

44:07.478 --> 44:10.311
I remember!
I remember!

44:10.381 --> 44:14.249
- Oh, SammyJo!
- I saw her!

44:14.318 --> 44:18.721
<i>I saw her in the kitchen.!
I saw her when she-</i>

44:21.825 --> 44:25.556
I was hiding because
I heard all the dishes breakin'.

44:27.631 --> 44:30.657
And then I came down the stairs
because it got quiet.

44:38.075 --> 44:40.566
<i>I saw her
through the crack in the door.</i>

44:40.644 --> 44:43.272
<i>She was walking back and forth.</i>

44:45.683 --> 44:50.848
<i>And then she stopped,
and she picked up the kitchen knife.</i>

44:56.960 --> 45:00.054
<i>I object.!
This is preposterous.!</i>

45:00.130 --> 45:02.860
I saw her!
I saw her do it!

45:02.933 --> 45:05.424
<i>Sam, you changed history.</i>

45:05.502 --> 45:08.562
That was just great.
You okay?

45:08.639 --> 45:10.630
Yeah.

45:14.211 --> 45:17.544
They gonna be all right, Al?
Yeah.

45:17.614 --> 45:21.345
Well, Ziggy says that since
SammyJo is carrying your genes...

45:21.418 --> 45:23.943
and now that you cleared Abagail,
the curse is broken.

45:24.021 --> 45:27.548
Um, Abagail gets married
in two years...

45:27.624 --> 45:30.923
<i>to a wonderful guy,
and they move to Chicago.</i>

45:30.994 --> 45:32.962
<i>And she's happy, Sam.
She's really happy.</i>

45:33.030 --> 45:35.760
How do you know all this?

45:35.833 --> 45:38.802
SammyJo told me.

45:38.869 --> 45:41.167
SammyJo?

45:41.238 --> 45:45.004
<i>SammyJo is working with us
on Project Quantum Leap, Sam.</i>

45:45.075 --> 45:46.667
What?
Yes.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.770
As a matter of fact, she has a theory
on how to bring you back home.

45:51.515 --> 45:53.915
Does she know I'm her father?

45:56.720 --> 45:58.654
No.

45:58.722 --> 46:02.818
And Ziggy says that after this leap,
you won't know either.

46:02.893 --> 46:04.952
I'll know, Al.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.999
I'll always know.

46:23.714 --> 46:25.705
You, uh-

46:27.351 --> 46:29.285
You take care of yourself, okay?

46:31.922 --> 46:34.083
I won't forget you.

46:46.870 --> 46:48.804
<i>You heard me!</i>

46:48.872 --> 46:51.363
Hands up!

46:51.441 --> 46:53.375
Everyone, stay calm.

46:53.443 --> 46:56.742
We'll get this over with
and be on our way.

46:56.814 --> 46:59.578
Keep me covered while I shut the blinds.

47:02.953 --> 47:05.683
Don't fall apart on me now, little brother.

47:11.328 --> 47:13.319
Oh, boy.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
