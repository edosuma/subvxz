haven't been easy lately,

bad things get,

11:02.487 --> 11:04.838
My work hours may
be changing soon.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.230
- More patients
than usual, Ms. A?

11:07.710 --> 11:10.452
- No, the opposite
actually, but yeah,

11:10.539 --> 11:13.716
a bunch of new hopeless
romantics, just like you guys.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.979
- I mean, you gotta
love us, Ms. A.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.634
- Oh, I do, Aldrich, that I do.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.201
Well, I've got some paperwork,

11:20.288 --> 11:22.725
so y'all have some fun
and behave yourselves.

11:22.812 --> 11:26.207
[upbeat cheerful music]

11:27.338 --> 11:30.515
[students chattering]

11:31.865 --> 11:32.648
- Yeah.

11:32.735 --> 11:33.736
- No!

11:36.957 --> 11:38.959
[cheering]

11:40.874 --> 11:42.571
- We did something!

12:08.858 --> 12:10.947
- Do you ever stop
looking at yourself?

12:11.034 --> 12:13.733
- And what's wrong with
liking the way I look?

12:13.820 --> 12:16.126
- Just seems a little
self-absorbed, is all.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.781
- Well, if you cared about
your appearance at all.

12:18.868 --> 12:19.913
[laughing]

12:20.000 --> 12:21.436
- You guys, that
was really mean.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.872
- Yeah, not okay.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.353
- You know what, Lexi,
not everyone is obsessed

12:25.440 --> 12:26.876
with their appearance
like you are.

12:26.963 --> 12:27.964
- You're one to talk.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.618
Little miss perfect Parker

12:29.705 --> 12:32.055
who always has to have her
makeup done just right.

12:32.142 --> 12:34.188
"Is my mascara smudged?"

12:34.275 --> 12:36.494
- "Do I look good in
this shade of lipstick?"

12:36.581 --> 12:38.322
[laughing]

12:38.409 --> 12:40.324
- Guys, please stop fighting.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.892
- [Abigail] I think I need
to lose at least five pounds.

12:42.979 --> 12:46.591
- Hmm, more like seven.
[girls laughing]

12:46.678 --> 12:48.593
- Guys, please stop fighting.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.507
- It's okay, honey.

12:49.594 --> 12:50.900
- Knock it off, okay?

12:50.987 --> 12:53.860
You're all beautiful,
end of story.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.949
- Yeah, if this is
a beauty contest

12:56.036 --> 12:57.777
I wouldn't know who to choose.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.039
Y'all are all drop
dead gorgeous.

12:59.126 --> 12:59.953
- Oh, give me a break.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.345
This is all pathetic.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.825
Stop trying to make
her feel better.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.609
- What do you think
you're doing, Abigail?

13:04.696 --> 13:05.959
You know that Belle
gets triggered

13:06.046 --> 13:07.221
with conflicts and
fights like this.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.222
- Well you know what?
- What?

13:08.309 --> 13:09.571
- She's gonna have to grow up

13:09.658 --> 13:11.051
and face the real world
one of these days.

13:11.138 --> 13:14.794
- Look, this is supposed
to be a safe place,

13:14.881 --> 13:16.926
not a place where Belle
has to face more trauma

13:17.013 --> 13:18.406
and get attacked by
bullies like you.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.929
- Oh, shut up!

13:20.016 --> 13:20.930
- Hey, no you ain't gonna
talk to her like that.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.345
It's just a bunch
of little kids.

You like art, it'll be fun.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.963
[knocking]

Hi, my name is Alex.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.055
How do you do?
- Hey.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.319
- I'm here for Hannah's party.

19:07.842 --> 19:08.625
Thank you.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.239
Hi, mermaids and mermen,

19:13.326 --> 19:14.109
how are you today?

19:14.196 --> 19:15.154
- [Children] Good.

19:15.850 --> 19:16.894
- Good.

19:16.981 --> 19:17.721
Are you ready to have some fun?

19:17.808 --> 19:18.244
- [Children] Yeah.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.900
- Okay, well, I heard that
it's somebody's birthday today.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.163
- Mine.
- Yours.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.207
You must be Hannah.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.166
How old are you today, Hannah?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.210
- Five.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.298
- Oh, you're a big girl.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.126
Do you brush your own hair?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.301
So do I.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.347
Would you like to see my brush?

19:34.434 --> 19:39.134
I have it right here in
my underwater mermaid bag.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.397
It's a dinglehopper.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.920
Works like this, see?

19:43.007 --> 19:47.142
- It's not a dinglehopper,
it is a fork.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.839
- Oh. [laughs nervously]

19:48.926 --> 19:49.492
Silly me.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.496
I guess y'all never saw
a dinglehopper before.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.758
Well--

19:54.845 --> 19:56.107
- [Boy] You're not a mermaid,

19:56.195 --> 19:57.935
you're a human
wearing a fake tail.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.418
- Well, I most certainly
am a mermaid, young man.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.595
You know, we mermaids when
we dry off we get legs.

20:05.682 --> 20:09.338
- Then why not wear a dress
and walk around on your legs?

20:09.425 --> 20:11.384
Why try to fool us
with a fake tail?

20:11.471 --> 20:13.299
What do you think we are,
gullible or something?

20:13.386 --> 20:15.736
We're kids, not idiots.

20:15.823 --> 20:16.911
- [Mother] Son, come here.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.478
- Okay. [laughs nervously]

20:18.565 --> 20:23.134
Well, why don't we try
something else out of my merbag?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.311
Look guys, isn't this neat?

20:25.398 --> 20:30.098
It's my magic empty bag.
[laughing]

20:31.055 --> 20:32.187
Doesn't it look empty?

20:34.494 --> 20:36.974
Would you like to
make something?

20:37.061 --> 20:38.019
Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.760
- What lives in the sea, guys?

20:39.847 --> 20:40.804
Anybody know?

20:40.891 --> 20:43.285
- Oh, fish.
- That's right.

20:43.372 --> 20:44.417
Fishes live under the sea.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.809
- Crabs.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.985
- Crabs do live
under the sea, too.

20:48.072 --> 20:48.725
What else?

20:49.509 --> 20:50.945
- Seahorse.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.555
- Yeah, seahorses live
under the sea, too.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.340
And so do mermaids.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.471
You know what?

20:55.558 --> 20:56.907
I think it would be really nice

20:56.994 --> 20:58.692
to make you all a fishy balloon.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.215
Would you like a fishy balloon?

21:00.302 --> 21:01.782
- [Children] Yeah!

21:01.869 --> 21:03.349
- [Alex] Would you
like a fishy balloon?

21:03.436 --> 21:04.437
- I want a seahorse.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.963
- Well, why not a nice
blue fishy balloon?

21:09.050 --> 21:10.573
- I want a seahorse.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.576
- Oh, okay.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.143
I'll try, sweetie.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.536
Okay.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.277
Alex, you can do this.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.672
- [Child] You made
another big balloon.

21:22.759 --> 21:23.412
- Yeah.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.761
Oh, okay.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.546
So, I'll just make
you a seahorse.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.547
[balloon pops]
[yells]

21:27.634 --> 21:28.330
Oh dear.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.288
- Yay!

21:29.375 --> 21:30.332
- Let's try that again.

21:31.638 --> 21:32.987
Okay, look it's yellow,

21:33.074 --> 21:34.989
it matches your bow,
isn't that pretty?

21:37.600 --> 21:38.993
Get it together.

21:40.603 --> 21:43.824
It's not that hard, right?

21:45.565 --> 21:46.348
Go like--
[balloon pops]

21:46.435 --> 21:47.697
Oh.

21:47.784 --> 21:48.394
[laughing]
- Hey.

to share with you.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.723
Well, something to
confess, actually.

34:35.377 --> 34:38.293
Our government grant was
not renewed six months ago,

34:39.947 --> 34:41.731
and I've been funding
this whole thing

34:41.818 --> 34:43.255
out of my pocket ever since.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.693
I never took business
school, y'all.

34:48.303 --> 34:52.045
I'm not so good with the
finances, and we're broke.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.221
- We're not gonna lose
the center, are we?

34:53.308 --> 34:55.310
- No, no, honey.

34:55.397 --> 34:56.964
Not if I can help it.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.835
- What can we do to help, Ms. A?

34:58.922 --> 35:00.924
- Well, you could tell me,

35:02.491 --> 35:04.711
why does this place
matter so much to you?

35:06.234 --> 35:08.628
Why does this place matter
so much to all of you?

35:10.151 --> 35:11.152
Justin.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.155
- I wanna say something,

35:14.242 --> 35:16.157
but I don't want you
guys to judge me.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.422
- Dude, don't worry,
we're all family here.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.294
- Yeah, we got your back, bro.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.043
- The reason I wanna be here

35:33.131 --> 35:35.872
is because I don't
wanna be home.

35:37.004 --> 35:37.657
My dad he...

35:39.267 --> 35:42.923
He has a temper, and he
likes to take it out on me.

35:44.403 --> 35:48.581
At home, anything I do,
it's not good enough.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.628
I can't ever make him happy.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.287
This...

35:59.374 --> 36:02.638
This center, Ms. Alex, it's...

36:02.725 --> 36:03.857
It's our home.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.034
And you guys are my family.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.036
- Thank you, Justin.

36:10.429 --> 36:15.173
- My dad died of cancer
last year, and...

36:17.000 --> 36:17.958
it broke me.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.227
It's like, how do you watch

36:26.314 --> 36:29.970
the guy that raised
you just fade away?

36:37.412 --> 36:39.588
[sobbing]

36:41.503 --> 36:42.243
But...

36:44.027 --> 36:47.074
But you guys accepted me,

36:47.161 --> 36:50.120
and you were the
shoulder I needed.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.213
That's why I'm here.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.781
- Thank you, Hannah.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.175
- My older brother
and I, we were close,

37:02.829 --> 37:04.700
but when he was my age
he ran away from home

37:06.311 --> 37:08.574
and he got mixed in
with the wrong crowd.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.098
Any drug you could
think of, he did.

37:12.708 --> 37:15.233
He didn't have a place
like this to come to,

37:15.320 --> 37:17.235
and that's what this
place is for us.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.411
It's a place for hope.

37:19.498 --> 37:22.283
- Ever since my
brother was born,

37:22.370 --> 37:26.679
my mom, she, [sighs] she
hasn't been the same.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.466
The doctor says that it's
postpartum depression.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.731
I just, there's not
too many reasons

37:35.818 --> 37:37.298
for me to be happy anymore.

37:37.385 --> 37:40.214
I'm just so glad
to have this place.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.435
You all bring a little
joy into my life.

37:44.871 --> 37:48.440
- You make us
happy, too, sweetie.

37:48.527 --> 37:49.267
Thank you.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.661
- Abby, what's wrong?

37:52.748 --> 37:53.445
- I'm sorry.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.450
I'm just realizing that
we're all in this together.

37:58.537 --> 38:02.454
In the third grade,
I was bullied so much

38:02.541 --> 38:03.585
because I love to sing.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.720
Even my friends said I sucked.

38:07.807 --> 38:11.027
I stopped singing altogether
until I came here.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.814
- It's okay, you're not alone.

38:14.901 --> 38:15.423
Me, too.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.514
- This place, it gave
me my voice back.

38:21.951 --> 38:25.433
But I took out my frustration
on all of you, and...

38:27.566 --> 38:28.306
I'm sorry.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.180
[sobbing]

38:38.707 --> 38:40.622
- I just come for the free food.

38:40.709 --> 38:43.016
[laughing]

38:45.453 --> 38:46.498
- Oh, guys.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.022
Guys, thank you so much.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.632
Abigail, thank you.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.808
That was hard, thank
you for your bravery.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.290
Thank you all so
much for sharing.

38:57.683 --> 39:00.468
This reaffirms in my heart

39:00.555 --> 39:02.252
why this place
needs to stay open.

39:03.645 --> 39:04.472
It matters.

39:05.908 --> 39:06.735
This place matters.

39:08.258 --> 39:11.610
You know, I've been
reading this book.

39:11.697 --> 39:14.482
It's called "God's
Calling", and in here,

39:14.569 --> 39:16.441
it talks about
how each one of us

39:16.528 --> 39:20.749
is created with gifts
and talents, desires,

39:20.836 --> 39:23.273
for a specific purpose.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.363
I don't know if you know
the story of Esther or not,

39:25.450 --> 39:27.452
but she was given the
gift of influence.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.149
She was put in a very
powerful position

39:29.236 --> 39:30.846
and it was scary for
her to use that gift,

39:30.933 --> 39:32.457
could've cost her her life.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.807
But the choices she
made saved a nation.

39:34.894 --> 39:37.418
Would you be willing to
be brave like she was?

39:37.505 --> 39:39.072
- Of course.
- Yeah, of course.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.508
- Would you use your
talents and gifts

39:40.595 --> 39:42.989
that I've seen in you
to fight for your home?

39:43.076 --> 39:43.816
- [Students] Yeah.

39:46.253 --> 39:47.950
- [Belle] Mr. Max!

39:48.037 --> 39:49.822
- [Students] Mr. Max!

39:49.909 --> 39:51.432
- Hey, y'all.

39:51.519 --> 39:54.304
- Mr. Max, what
are you doing here?

39:54.392 --> 39:55.784
- You didn't tell them, did you?

39:55.871 --> 39:58.700
- Well, I was getting to
that, and you're early.

39:58.787 --> 40:00.485
- It's never too
early to save the day.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.051
- And also so humble, I see.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.401
[laughing]

40:03.488 --> 40:04.576
- [Belle] We missed
you, Mr. Max.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.316
- I missed you guys, too.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.406
- We've got some ideas here.

40:08.493 --> 40:11.017
Actually, Mr. Max, take it away.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.410
- Okay, guys.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.674
Well, how would you
all like to star

40:15.761 --> 40:17.676
in a musical written by moi?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.593
- Yes!
- To save the activity center.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.332
- [Students] Yes!

40:22.420 --> 40:23.421
- Yes?

40:23.508 --> 40:25.074
Yes?
- Oh my goodness.

40:25.161 --> 40:25.945
- Awesome!

40:31.254 --> 40:32.212
- No.

40:32.299 --> 40:33.692
I said they could have the space

40:33.779 --> 40:36.390
for $50 a square foot
and nothing less.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.784
I have over $25 million
invested in this property.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.178
Look, if they give you
any resistance at all,

40:42.265 --> 40:43.136
you kick 'em to the curb.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.314
This is a business, and if
they want waterfront property

40:47.401 --> 40:48.881
they have to pay the piper.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.361
[thundering]

40:51.449 --> 40:52.624
I have another call coming in.

40:52.711 --> 40:53.886
Just get this deal done.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.544
Hello, this is
Chandler DelaHoussaye.

41:01.633 --> 41:02.590
No, Mr. Marcello.

41:04.810 --> 41:05.332
No.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.728
I fully understand the
terms of our agreement.

41:09.815 --> 41:11.469
I just need a little
more time, sir.

41:13.079 --> 41:16.517
Please, I will have you
your money, with interest.

41:16.604 --> 41:17.387
I promise.

41:18.563 --> 41:19.520
Thank you, sir.

41:20.652 --> 41:21.217
Take care.

41:22.349 --> 41:27.354
[intense music]
[sighs deeply]

41:29.704 --> 41:31.140
Let's see here.

41:31.227 --> 41:31.967
Where is it?

41:32.054 --> 41:32.794
Where is it?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.537
There it is.

41:38.757 --> 41:41.934
That sweet little
property down by the river

41:42.021 --> 41:44.502
where that nonprofit's
gonna go belly up.

41:46.591 --> 41:47.330
Let's see.

41:48.984 --> 41:49.724
If I can...

41:52.161 --> 41:54.207
get the demolition
done for $50,000,

41:56.296 --> 41:58.646
and I can pay
planning and zoning

41:58.733 --> 42:02.389
and the site inspector $125,000

42:04.565 --> 42:06.567
I can make a ton of
money off this deal.

42:08.177 --> 42:11.050
Stacy, pull the car
up front, please.

42:11.137 --> 42:13.095
I wanna go see that
pathetic little property

42:13.182 --> 42:14.009
down by the river.

42:16.882 --> 42:17.839
I need this to work.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.843
- Max, thank you so much

42:21.930 --> 42:23.497
for dropping everything
you were doing

42:23.584 --> 42:26.065
and hopping on that plane,
getting down here so quickly.

42:26.152 --> 42:28.589
I don't know how I'm
ever gonna repay you.

42:28.676 --> 42:29.590
- I could...

42:30.591 --> 42:31.766
think of a few things.

42:35.988 --> 42:38.643
- Look, we have a lot to get
done and not a lot of time.

42:39.774 --> 42:41.254
Strictly business, okay?

42:41.341 --> 42:42.734
- You could suck the helium

42:42.821 --> 42:44.083
out of the Goodyear
Blimp, you know that?

42:47.782 --> 42:50.437
- I guess I never was
fun enough for you.

42:50.524 --> 42:52.352
That's why you ran off
to New York, isn't it?

42:52.439 --> 42:54.180
- Ran off to New York?

42:54.267 --> 42:55.747
I didn't run off to New York,

42:55.834 --> 42:57.270
you forced me out, remember?

42:58.401 --> 42:59.664
What was I gonna do?

42:59.751 --> 43:01.230
Stay around here
and see you around

43:01.317 --> 43:03.581
and act like I didn't
have feelings for you?

43:03.668 --> 43:05.147
I asked you to come with me.

43:06.279 --> 43:07.497
- Max.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.847
Are you gonna help me or not?

43:11.763 --> 43:13.547
- Okay, boss lady, what
do you need from me?

43:13.634 --> 43:15.244
- If you could write a musical,

43:15.331 --> 43:17.638
something that would catch
the community's interest,

43:17.725 --> 43:20.728
maybe we could raise enough
money to save the center.

43:20.815 --> 43:23.165
But it would have to be
quick, I'm out of time.

43:25.777 --> 43:27.909
- So, let me get this straight.

43:27.996 --> 43:31.086
You need me to write a
musical, like, yesterday?

43:31.173 --> 43:33.306
- Yeah.
- What about a budget?

43:33.393 --> 43:35.700
Stage crew, stage
manager, production crew--

43:35.787 --> 43:36.788
- No.
- Lights.

43:36.875 --> 43:37.571
- No.
- Stage.

43:37.658 --> 43:40.095
- No, no. [sighs]

43:40.182 --> 43:44.186
Max, look, I know some of the
logistics are out of order,

43:44.273 --> 43:46.145
but if you can just take
care of the creative side

43:46.232 --> 43:49.061
I promise I'll get
the details in order.

43:49.148 --> 43:49.844
- And what about us?

43:49.931 --> 43:50.671
I mean...

43:53.065 --> 43:54.022
What's in it for me?

43:55.807 --> 43:57.504
[Alex scoffs]

43:57.591 --> 43:58.374
- There you go again.

43:58.461 --> 43:59.201
Been here, what?

43:59.288 --> 44:00.812
Five minutes?

44:00.899 --> 44:02.988
And already you're making
this all about you.

44:03.075 --> 44:06.992
Max, these kids trust me.

44:07.079 --> 44:08.907
I cannot let them down.

44:08.994 --> 44:12.127
If we can't fix this,
they lose everything.

44:12.214 --> 44:13.389
- What do you want, Alex?

44:13.476 --> 44:15.565
What does your heart want?

44:17.045 --> 44:17.829
- My heart?

44:21.876 --> 44:24.096
[Alex sighs]

44:26.098 --> 44:26.707
Max.

44:28.143 --> 44:30.232
If you ever really
cared about me,

44:32.278 --> 44:35.063
please, help my kids.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.849
I can't lose my kids.

44:42.810 --> 44:44.769
Please.
- Okay.

44:44.856 --> 44:46.074
How much are you in the hole?

44:46.161 --> 44:48.729
[Alex crying]

44:49.861 --> 44:51.601
- 60 grand.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.865
- 60 grand.
- I know.

44:54.996 --> 44:56.650
- Oh boy, Alex--
- I'm sorry.

44:56.737 --> 44:58.870
- You really, you got yourself

44:58.957 --> 45:00.828
into a pickle here
without me, huh?

45:00.915 --> 45:03.309
- Without you? [laughs]

45:04.789 --> 45:08.575
Once again, you are
making this all about you.

45:10.403 --> 45:11.883
I don't know what I was...

45:12.971 --> 45:13.754
Why did I even.

45:15.669 --> 45:17.018
You know, you say you know me,

45:18.716 --> 45:21.806
I don't think you do.
[intense music]

45:27.899 --> 45:30.510
- I think I know you
well enough, Alex.

45:30.597 --> 45:31.816
This was a mistake
coming down here,

45:31.903 --> 45:33.295
I can see that now.

45:33.382 --> 45:36.821
You don't want me back,
you just wanna use me.

45:36.908 --> 45:38.736
Shame on you, Alex.

45:38.823 --> 45:40.694
Shame on you.
- No.

45:40.781 --> 45:41.477
Max.
- Alex.

45:41.564 --> 45:42.914
- Max.

45:43.001 --> 45:43.741
Max!

45:46.134 --> 45:48.702
[sighs] My god.

after biblical movies

watched when I was a kid.

it out I wouldn't survive.

- I don't think God
loves me all that much.

01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:42.352
- No, no, CJ, God loves you.

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:45.093
Why would you say that?

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.051
- I did the whole
church thing, Ms. A.

01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:53.276
I know The Bible says
that God is my Father.

01:09:56.366 --> 01:09:58.281
What kind of father
lets their child suffer?

01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:07.115
It just feels like he's
turned his back on me.

01:10:10.118 --> 01:10:12.164
And I'm so tired of feeling...

01:11:40.513 --> 01:11:45.475
- Come on, C.
[exciting music]

01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:17.463
- I'm so sorry,
Mr. DelaHoussaye,

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:19.813
they refused to stop at
the front desk and sign in.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.337
- It's okay, Stacy.

01:12:21.424 --> 01:12:23.339
I know these two fine,
upstanding gentlemen.

01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:24.383
I'm good.

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:25.253
Thank you so much.

01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:31.782
- Chandler Hollywood
DelaHoussaye, in the flesh.

01:12:31.869 --> 01:12:33.740
- Howdy, boys, what
can I do for you?

01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:36.308
- Mr. Marcello would
like his money today.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:41.400
- I just spoke with
Mr. Marcello last week,

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:42.880
we have an agreement.

01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.534
We have a special bond.

01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:46.187
Everything's gonna
be fine, guys.

01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:48.320
- I don't think pretty boy here

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:51.149
is on the same page as the boss.

01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:53.064
Mind I should rattle
his cage a little?

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:55.240
- Not just yet.

01:12:55.327 --> 01:12:58.112
Mr. Marcello likes
his money on time,

01:12:58.199 --> 01:12:59.853
and let me tell you
something, little man,

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.507
if you love anything
about yourself,

01:13:01.594 --> 01:13:03.379
your business, or
whatever you do,

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:05.206
you're gonna have
that money today.

01:13:05.293 --> 01:13:06.294
Do you understand me?

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:08.166
Are you hearing me?

01:13:08.253 --> 01:13:09.254
- I hear you guys.

01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:11.256
Everything is crystal clear.

01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:12.431
- Let's hope so.

01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:15.695
[Alex sighs deeply]

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:16.957
- This is a great idea.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.136
[sighs]

01:13:22.223 --> 01:13:23.529
Max...

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:24.965
Do you really think the kids

01:13:25.052 --> 01:13:26.663
are gonna be ready
for tomorrow night?

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:27.664
- Yeah, I think they're as ready

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:29.448
as they're ever gonna be.

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:30.928
- And you know, I looked online,

01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:33.496
there are 681
tickets sold already.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:35.193
- 681 tickets?

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:39.066
That's more than I had at
my last show in New York.

01:13:40.633 --> 01:13:43.201
- Well, this endeavor
may not save the center,

01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:44.594
but at least I'll know

01:13:44.681 --> 01:13:45.638
we did everything
we possibly could.

01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:49.033
- Yeah.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.775
We really did get this together
pretty good, didn't we?

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:55.431
You know, you and I
make a great team.

01:13:57.650 --> 01:14:00.218
- Well, I really
should thank you again.

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:03.177
You didn't have
to come and rescue

01:14:03.264 --> 01:14:04.701
me and all my problems.

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.400
- I kinda like being your
knight in shining armor.

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.970
It's worth it to see that
beautiful smile again.

01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:16.626
- Oh sir, you make me blush.

01:14:21.108 --> 01:14:23.502
Seriously, would you like
to take walk on the pier?

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:25.373
- I'd love to.

01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:29.247
[romantic music]

[Alex and Max whispering]

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.531
Hey, Roxy, have you seen Alex?

01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:36.662
- Yeah, she was here earlier

01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:38.229
but she went back to the center

01:15:38.316 --> 01:15:39.360
to get the kids' presents
for after the show.

01:15:39.447 --> 01:15:40.144
She'll be back soon.

01:15:40.231 --> 01:15:41.537
- Okay, thanks.

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:43.016
- Max, Max, do you
have the batteries

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:45.584
for the wireless mics?
- Yeah, batteries.

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:49.066
Okay, A/V booth, under
the console on the shelf.

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:49.980
I think they should be there.

01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:51.329
- Okay, I'll check 'em all,

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:52.765
put the batteries
in and test 'em.

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:54.767
- Hey, wait, wait,
wait, before you go,

01:15:54.854 --> 01:15:56.682
remember, we do need to label

01:15:56.769 --> 01:15:59.642
each one independently,
each channel.

01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:01.557
We can't have any mess
ups tonight, okay?

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:03.559
- From your lips to God's ears.

01:16:03.646 --> 01:16:04.734
- Thanks, Roberto.

01:16:06.257 --> 01:16:07.388
[sighs] Where'd she go?

01:16:12.263 --> 01:16:14.482
[humming]

01:16:16.006 --> 01:16:18.138
- Good afternoon, Ms. Park.

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:19.444
I've been waiting for you.

01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:21.446
- How did you get in here?

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:25.450
- Door was unlocked,
I let myself in.

01:16:26.451 --> 01:16:29.323
- Well, you're trespassing.

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:31.325
This is private property.

01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:33.153
I'd like you to leave now.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.981
- Not so quick, missy.

01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:37.114
We have some business
to conduct here.

01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:41.597
- Listen, Mr. Chandler, I don't
know who you think you are

01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:45.775
but I already told you, this
building is not for sale.

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:47.037
Now, please leave.

01:16:47.124 --> 01:16:48.604
- Well, come Monday morning

01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:52.608
you will no longer own this
property, the bank will.

01:16:52.695 --> 01:16:55.611
I am merely here as
to assist your exit.

01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:56.699
Here.

01:16:59.136 --> 01:16:59.876
This is for you.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:13.933
[ripping]

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:19.373
- Now get out before
I call the police.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.638
- That was not a wise move.

01:17:22.725 --> 01:17:23.726
- Get out!

01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:26.685
- After you.

It's a shame, such
a pretty woman.

01:18:06.899 --> 01:18:08.248
It didn't have to be this way,

01:18:09.772 --> 01:18:12.165
but I'm taking that teen
center back from you.

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:13.863
You just sit in here and chill.

01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:20.521
- Roxy, did Alex
ever get back yet?

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:21.871
- No.
- It's an hour till show time,

01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:23.568
I'm starting to get worried.

01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.744
- No, but maybe she stopped
at her apartment or something.

01:18:25.831 --> 01:18:26.876
Did you try calling her?

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:28.355
- I did.

01:18:28.442 --> 01:18:30.140
It just keeps rolling
over to voicemail.

01:18:30.227 --> 01:18:31.750
- That's not like her.

01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:33.012
Maybe I should go look for her.

01:18:33.099 --> 01:18:34.797
- No, no, look, I got it, okay?

01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:36.842
Look, you and Roberto are
gonna be in charge, okay?

01:18:36.929 --> 01:18:38.844
- What?
- Not for the whole thing,

01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:40.324
just at least until
I get back, okay?

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.238
You've got this, okay?

01:18:41.325 --> 01:18:42.805
You've got this.

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:44.720
You're in charge, but I'll
be back as soon as I can.

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.724

Alex.

Alex, are you in there?

wondering what happened.

This guy named Chandler
DelaHoussaye, I think.

01:20:53.196 --> 01:20:56.547
He came by my office,
offered to buy me out.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.117
I turned him down,

went out for my school musical,

02:00:22.215 --> 02:00:24.652
and I remember it
like it was yesterday.

02:00:24.739 --> 02:00:26.349
It was Godspell.

02:00:26.436 --> 02:00:28.699
I was a shy kid and I
had never sung on stage

before that time.

02:00:30.527 --> 02:00:34.227
But I went to auditions, and...

02:00:35.837 --> 02:00:38.056
I said a little prayer.

02:00:38.143 --> 02:00:39.536
Do you know what I prayed for?

02:00:39.623 --> 02:00:41.843
- Not sure I entirely follow.

02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:44.628
- What I prayed for was
that God and the Holy Spirit

02:00:44.715 --> 02:00:46.761
would somehow take over my body,

02:00:46.848 --> 02:00:50.634
and mainly my voice, and just
let me not embarrass myself

02:00:50.721 --> 02:00:52.201
in front of my classmates?

02:00:52.288 --> 02:00:53.768
- Did it work?

02:00:53.855 --> 02:00:56.336
- The next day I went
to the bulletin board

02:00:56.423 --> 02:00:58.468
and I took a look
at the cast sheets,

02:00:58.555 --> 02:01:02.167
and miraculously,
they cast me as Jesus.

02:01:02.255 --> 02:01:04.387
Me, as Jesus.

02:01:04.474 --> 02:01:07.477
Now, my mother, she was so proud

02:01:07.564 --> 02:01:09.610
and we decided not to share

02:01:09.697 --> 02:01:12.265
my love of dramatics
with my father.

02:01:12.352 --> 02:01:14.354
The whole show is a
blank to me now, but...

02:01:15.485 --> 02:01:17.574
When I was up there on the cross

02:01:17.661 --> 02:01:20.838

02:01:22.405 --> 02:01:26.235
I saw him in the audience,
and he was crying.
