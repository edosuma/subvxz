14:33.960 --> 14:36.600
Oo-ooh, look at Captain

15:17.800 --> 15:19.560
Come on, come on,
come on, come on,

15:19.600 --> 15:21.600
there's only
a one-car length in it!

15:22.680 --> 15:24.120
Easy!

15:24.160 --> 15:26.160
JEREMY: Bloody Nora,
that was close!

15:26.200 --> 15:29.240
But I got a terrible start,
so we gotta do it again, May.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.400
I can't do it.
It's spinning its wheels.

(SIREN BLARES IN DISTANCE)

15:54.600 --> 15:57.240
You do know you're both
too old for this, don't you?

15:57.280 --> 16:01.520
JEREMY: What, for driving
muscle cars up and down
the public roads of Detroit?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.600
Because nobody else
is using them.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.240
Well, Richard Hammond
certainly isn't using them.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.280
(LAUGHS)

16:09.320 --> 16:13.120
Since it was one-all and we
were having enormous fun
annoying Hammond,

16:14.160 --> 16:15.760
we decided to go again.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.680
RICHARD: What is this,
best of 30 now?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.480
What else are we gonna do?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.640
Keep going till
one of you wets yourselves.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.360
JEREMY: For the next 17 runs,

16:28.400 --> 16:30.760
the result was always
the same.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.560
Thank you very much.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.080

16:43.000 --> 16:44.520

16:44.560 --> 16:46.560
I'm not giving in, James.
One more.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.200
Oh, for God's sake!

16:49.240 --> 16:53.560
I gave him my word I wouldn't
use launch control.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.360
I'm simply going to go back
on that and not tell him.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.760
(TYRES SCREECH)

17:02.840 --> 17:05.320
That was a good gear change.
So was that.

17:05.360 --> 17:10.760
But there's just nothing I
can do to get up with that
1,000 horsepower monster.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.800
Finally,
I waved the white flag.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.080
And then we took
a closer look

17:19.080 --> 17:23.080
at the savage beating
heart of The Exorcist.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.160
And that's the standard
Corvette engine, basically.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.560
-Z06, yeah.
-With a supercharger
plonked on the top.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.000
-That's there, yes?
-Yes, 2.9 litre supercharger.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.880
So the bit they've bolted
to your engine

17:35.920 --> 17:38.560
is bigger than most
European engines?

17:38.640 --> 17:41.040
-Yes.
-So is the one on mine.
It's 2.7 litres.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.560
Yeah, not as big.
The point is, Hammond,
this is The Exorcist.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.320
The job of The Exorcist
is to vanquish the Demon.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.800
It's like, you remember
in the '60s, I think,

17:49.880 --> 17:52.080
De Tomaso made a car
called the Mangusta,

17:52.080 --> 17:54.320
which is Italian
for mongoose.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.440
Yes, and a mongoose
can kill a cobra, can't it?

17:56.480 --> 17:59.920
-That's why they did it.
-Yes, but this hasn't
vanquished the Demon.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.560
-It hasn't beaten it.
-Tell you what.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.040
Why don't you find
a racetrack or a runway
somewhere, OK?

18:06.080 --> 18:07.640
I'll gracefully bow out.

18:07.680 --> 18:12.400
And we can have a race
between good...and evil.

18:19.560 --> 18:24.880
First, though, we decided to
find out which of our cars
makes the loudest noise.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.920
There were, of course,
many possible locations

18:28.960 --> 18:31.520
for this important test.

18:31.560 --> 18:36.560
But eventually, we found one
that was absolutely ideal.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.160
RICHARD: What is this place?

18:52.200 --> 18:55.160
Well, it obviously
was a theatre.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.960
They built it on the site

18:57.000 --> 19:00.880
of Henry Ford's
first ever workshop.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.040
-And when I say theatre...
-Oh, wow!

19:05.080 --> 19:07.000
So it was in 1925
they built it,

19:07.040 --> 19:09.960
when Detroit was
just about the richest city
in the world.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.160
-You can see that.
-They can just build that.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.960
And then in the '70s, it was
converted into a rock venue.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.320
So, I mean, look at these
tickets I've got for it.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.320
RICHARD: ZZ Top.
-ZZ Top and T Rex.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.760
-What a gig
that would've been!
-It would've been fantastic.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.440
Sly And The Family Stone,
Spencer Davis.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.280
Steve Winwood
has performed in here.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.040
David Bowie
performed in here.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.480
-Blue Oyster Cult, Bob Seger.
-This was a serious venue.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.160
Oh, serious venue.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.680
And then, there were some
credit card companies

19:37.720 --> 19:39.720
in the offices
which are behind that wall.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.440
And they said,
"We need some parking."

19:42.480 --> 19:45.200
And just bought it
and turned it into
a multi-storey car park.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.240
-That's amazing.
-Takes the romance out of it.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.080
It's sort of staggering.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.520
It's the birthplace of
Henry Ford's business.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.560
RICHARD: Yeah.
-Then a theatre.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.560
It's a car park.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.880
We can bring some theatre
back with our noise test.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.760
Actually, there's a kind of
poetry to it, it's beautiful.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.800
-Precisely.
-Not just bringing
the poetry,

20:02.800 --> 20:04.800
also bringing
the decibel-o-meter.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.520
JEREMY: Oh, perfect.
-So you can go and uh...
go first.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.520
Why am I going first?

20:10.560 --> 20:13.800
-I just said
you can go first.
-He did. I heard him say it.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.680
RICHARD:
Since the owners
feared the noise

20:17.720 --> 20:21.040
from our engines would bring
down the crumbling roof,

20:21.080 --> 20:24.160
we were given
protective clothing.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.400
We have to put this on
because there may be dust.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.880
There will be dust.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.280
Traction off.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.320
I'll just make wheel spin.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.240
Wheel spin, that just makes
a huge amount of noise.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.440
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.280

Well, wait a minute, you
don't know, you haven't...

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
-You're the first to go.
-125?

21:19.040 --> 21:20.760
Yes.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.080
The Who.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.320
Widely regarded to be
the loudest rock band
of all time.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.320
-Yes.
-126 decibels.

21:31.520 --> 21:35.080
Deep Purple,
a mere 117 decibels.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.520
That car is louder
than Deep Purple.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.320
But probably a lot quieter
than my Demon.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.400
Any minute now,
a paramedic will be
cutting his trousers off.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.560
He should've taken
them off before he got in.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.640
I don't know why
he wears trousers.

Yeah, but,
it doesn't make any noise.

for this, they built it
for drag racing.

do that, so...

-Yes.

-Yes.
-£40,000.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.480
Yeah, but mine's better,
so it's more expensive.

-£40,000.
-It's faster and louder.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.680

24:49.720 --> 24:52.880
Am I the only person here
who understands muscle cars?

24:55.120 --> 24:57.120
That's a ridiculous thing
to say!

25:00.800 --> 25:02.320
JEREMY: Having had
a very busy morning,

25:02.360 --> 25:04.960
we were now hungry.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Which, in this part of town,
was a problem.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.280
Not an abundance of
restaurants around here,
is there?

25:13.480 --> 25:16.400
RICHARD:
I haven't seen any.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.160
JAMES: I just noticed
a Coney Island Restaurant

25:18.200 --> 25:20.880
but I'm afraid it's
been shut for 30 years.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.080
JEREMY: Having failed
to find even a takeout,

25:25.120 --> 25:28.480
we started to look
for a hotel.

25:28.520 --> 25:31.120
But there wasn't
one of those either.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.760
So we decided to buy a house.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.000
Let me show you
what we've got.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.480
Handsome vestibule, feature
tiled floor, front room here,

25:43.520 --> 25:46.360
feature fireplace, loads of
light from all these windows.

25:46.400 --> 25:50.360
This, I would say, use as
a dining room because
it's adjacent to the kitchen.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.840
Needs the appliances
refitting, not a big job.

25:52.880 --> 25:56.560
In there, I would say that's
a really handy games room,

25:56.600 --> 25:59.080
TV room, overlooking the
garden and the double garage.

25:59.120 --> 26:02.520
Here, perfect for a home
office, maybe a snug.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.800
Upstairs four bedrooms,
and here's the kicker.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.560
An independent granny flat
with its own kitchen,

26:09.600 --> 26:13.440
so Jeremy can live up there
semi-independently for as
long as he can manage.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.080
And the price?
$2,200.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.600
Is that really only...
What was it, $2,200?

26:21.640 --> 26:23.000
-Yeah.
-1800 quid.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.200
Amazing, isn't it?

26:24.240 --> 26:26.160
Shall I show you
something else amazing?

26:26.200 --> 26:31.280
Captain Slow has fallen for
this eco-allotment claptrap.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.840
I haven't fallen for it,
and it's not claptrap,
it's just a vegetable plot.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.040
-It's only a bit.
-Buy food, don't grow it.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.360
-Why not?
-That's a farmer's job.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.800
Turning a city into
a vegetable garden
is ridiculous.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.080
No, who's turned a city
into a vegetable garden?

26:45.120 --> 26:47.040
That's what they want to do
and you're encouraging them.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.080
Detroit should be
for petrolheads.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.720
It should be for massive V8s
like our cars.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.440
JAMES: It's a great idea
by a city that's having
a bad time

26:54.480 --> 26:56.720
and trying to use
its initiative.
What's wrong with it?

26:56.760 --> 26:58.320
It's not as if there's any
vegetables in the shops.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.040
-New is better.
-I am not listening to
any more of this.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.160
I am going to go off.
I'm gonna find a shop.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.720
I'm gonna come back
with burgers.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.920
Well, you can have
some curly kale in them.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.440
Bloody allotment!

27:08.480 --> 27:10.400
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

27:10.440 --> 27:12.480
Just because
he's become a vegetarian

27:12.520 --> 27:15.880
doesn't mean that absolutely
everybody has to be one.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.000
-Don't be a moron!
-Well, I can't get out,
he's parked in the way.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.040
(ENGINE REVVING)

27:27.960 --> 27:30.920
Well, on that terrible
disappointment,
back to the tent.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.960
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

27:34.440 --> 27:36.720
You asked for it.
You asked for it.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.280
We never got
the burgers either.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.600
No, we didn't.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.200
We uh...

27:44.320 --> 27:46.480
We shall pick that up
later on.

27:46.520 --> 27:50.240
But now it is time to drop
the car keys of chat

27:50.280 --> 27:53.360
down the drain of debate...

27:53.400 --> 27:55.680
on Conversation Street.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.720
(MELLOW JAZZ)

27:58.960 --> 28:00.960
(LAUGHTER)

28:02.760 --> 28:04.200
That's a little weird.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.840
-How'd you do that?
-Don't know. Can't remember.

28:06.880 --> 28:11.640
Can I just begin by saying
that I think the very concept
of incongruity

28:11.680 --> 28:15.200
was defined in that film
in Detroit by James May,

28:15.240 --> 28:17.680
the slowest moving man
in history,

28:17.720 --> 28:20.560
driving around in
a car called The Exorcist.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.400
Yeah, it just doesn't work.
"James May is The Exorcist."

28:23.440 --> 28:27.040
No, I mean, if he's gonna
have a car, it should be
called The Florist.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.080
-(LAUGHTER)
-Or The Organist.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.880
-Simple change to
that, The Onanist.
-Nice.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.760
-I think The Onanist
would work well.
-Have you quite finished?

28:35.800 --> 28:38.840
-Uh...yeah.
-Good, actually I'd like to
talk about Motor City.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.000
More specifically,
what's happening to it.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.520
I'll tell you
what's happening to it.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.680
It is being slowly ruined
by vegetable-ists.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.280
-Oh, God.
-It is!

28:47.320 --> 28:50.280
There are two million acres
of land in Detroit, OK?

28:50.320 --> 28:53.680
Would anybody like to guess
how many acres have been
given over to allotments?

28:55.040 --> 28:57.600
MAN: Six.
-(RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER)

28:57.640 --> 28:59.800
-1,000.
-No, it's three.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.360
Three acres.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.600
-And he's driven over
two of them.
-Exactly.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.080
Yes, and rightly so.
It's like cancer.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.120
-It's not like cancer!
-It is!

29:08.160 --> 29:11.240
If you said, "I've got
two billion cells in my body

29:11.280 --> 29:13.000
and only three are cancerous
so I shall do nothing..."

29:13.040 --> 29:14.760
You don't, you cut them out.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.360
Yeah, but cancer
is a serious threat
to your health.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.400
Well, so are vegetables.
They are.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.440
You do know you're mad?

29:21.480 --> 29:23.320
No, I'll tell you
what I'm mad about.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.200
I'm mad as hell
about Detroit.

29:25.240 --> 29:29.840
Because in 1960, that was
the richest city in America.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.400
The richest.
And now it is the poorest.

29:33.440 --> 29:37.400
And no other city
anywhere in the world
has collapsed that quickly.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.840
What about Hiroshima?

29:39.880 --> 29:41.360
(LAUGHTER)

29:41.400 --> 29:42.760
Apart from Hiroshima.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.560
Pompeii.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.640
Yes, apart from
Hiroshima and Pompeii,

29:47.680 --> 29:49.800
no city has collapsed
as fast as Detroit has.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.840
-It's unbelievable.
-Incredible the scale of it.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.160
There used to be
43 car factories in Detroit.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.840
43.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.880
Now two. Just two.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.800
I actually think it's because
America won the war, weirdly.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.720
-Vietnam.
-Really?

30:04.760 --> 30:07.040
No, I was lying.
They lost that one.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.960
Not in all the films,
they didn't.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.560
They won in the films
but when you add up
all the battles they won,

30:11.600 --> 30:13.600
-weirdly they lost the war.
-Did they?

30:13.640 --> 30:15.720
No, I'm actually talking
about World War II.

30:15.760 --> 30:19.600
At the end of that,
Japan had lost its empire,
so it lost all its resources.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.280
So they were forced to make
compact, economical,
efficient cars.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.520
And then the oil crisis
hit in 1973,

30:25.560 --> 30:27.280
and the Americans,
with their big V8s,

30:27.320 --> 30:30.280
were forced to buy small,
compact, economical cars
from Japan.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.600
And then realised
they were better.

30:32.640 --> 30:36.960
No, I think it's because
American cars are too cheap.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.200
-Too cheap?
-It's a business thing.
That's the problem.

30:39.240 --> 30:43.000
Sorry, everyone, I
fear we are about to get
an economic lecture from...

30:44.360 --> 30:46.480
-...Chancellor Hammond here.
-(LAUGHTER)

30:46.520 --> 30:49.320
-Well, no.
-The other
Chancellor Hammond.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.680
No, you are... Now
concentrate, let me put
this into context for you.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.280
A lot of supercars have
arrived on the scene
recently.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.280
I've got pictures of them.
This is the McLaren
Speedtail,

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
that's 1,000 horsepower.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.160
Costs £2.1 million.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.960
-And its wheels are odd.
-They are. They don't match.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.240
This is the Aston Martin
Valkyrie, that's 1,000
horsepower again.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.000
£2.5 million.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.640
This one, that's
the Ferrari FXX-K Evo,

31:13.680 --> 31:16.720
1,000 horsepower,
£3.5 million.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.760
Best looking Ferrari
of all time, that.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.640
-It does look amazing, yeah,
-It is absolutely staggering.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.080
However, they've all got
1,000 horsepower,

31:24.120 --> 31:27.480
which means
they will all be undriveable.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.120
Yeah, whereas my Exorcist
has 1,000 horsepower

31:30.160 --> 31:33.360
and is undriveable
for under £100,000.

31:33.400 --> 31:37.120
Yes, and that's... that's
exactly my economic point.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.760
They're selling them
too cheap.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.560
They're just giving it away.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.080
If American carmakers
doubled the price of
the cars that they sell,

31:44.120 --> 31:47.920
bear with me,
they would double
the money that they make.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.880
It's not that complicated
when you think about it.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.600
If you follow the logic.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.560
I've said before,
the wrong Hammond is
in charge of Britain's--

31:54.600 --> 31:56.600
Yeah. It is incredible.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.200
You've got a supply
and demand graph.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.000
If you take away
the demand axis,

32:00.040 --> 32:02.680
life becomes much easier
when it's all just supply.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.240
Precisely. The Hellcat
that I was driving

32:05.280 --> 32:07.200
was priced at £67,000.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.400
-Yeah.
-People are now selling them,

32:09.440 --> 32:12.440
that same car,
second-hand for £120,000.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.640
And one bloke has advertised
one for half a million.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.840
So that means they were
too cheap and I'm right.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.040
-It is hard to argue
with that.
-Unassailable.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.160
And we don't have time,
so let's move it on.

32:25.200 --> 32:28.840
Because you may remember
in the very first show

32:28.880 --> 32:30.680
of The Grand Tour
in the first season...

32:30.720 --> 32:33.840
I was blown
away by a McLaren P1.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.320
Yeah, I do remember.
You said it would be faster

32:36.360 --> 32:38.880
than the Porsche 918
and the Ferrari LaFerrari.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.800
-Mm-hm.
-And, no, wait a minute,
it wasn't, was it?

32:41.840 --> 32:45.080
And as a result, the only
thing that got blown away
was your house.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.600
-That's undoubtedly true.
-Yeah.

32:47.640 --> 32:50.520
But the thing is,
it remains to this day
the most exciting,

32:50.560 --> 32:53.360
most brutal, most visceral
car I've ever driven.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.680
And I didn't think
it could ever be topped,

32:55.720 --> 32:57.480
but McLaren
have given it a bash.

32:57.520 --> 33:02.240
And I thought,
"Well, if they've built a car
that can out-P1 a P1,

33:02.280 --> 33:05.200
I'd better test it
somewhere a bit less...

33:05.240 --> 33:07.680
narrow
and a bit less tree-lined

33:07.720 --> 33:10.600
and a bit less
covered in deers and badgers
than the Eboladrome.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.800
(LAUGHTER)

33:11.840 --> 33:15.080
So I took it to the fastest
racetrack in Europe,

33:15.120 --> 33:17.240
which is... Actually, anyone
wanna guess which it is?

33:18.280 --> 33:20.160
MAN: Monza?
-No, not Monza.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.720
-Spa.
-Not Spa.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.920
-Do you know?
-What?

33:22.960 --> 33:24.960
-Do you know?
-(LAUGHTER)

33:25.000 --> 33:26.160
Of course I know!

33:26.200 --> 33:29.680
-You know? That's unusual.
-Why is it unusual?

33:29.720 --> 33:33.560
You didn't know any of the
answers on Who Wants To Be
A Millionaire, did you?

33:33.600 --> 33:35.480
I mean...

33:35.520 --> 33:37.520
I'm just saying.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.680
You didn't.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.240
No. But, no.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.760
No.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.840
They didn't ask me
any of the questions
I knew the answers to.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.080
-That's what it was.
-No, but it's not called

33:48.120 --> 33:50.680
Who Wants To Know Things
Jeremy Happens To Know,
is it?

33:50.720 --> 33:52.840
-It's Thruxton.
-What is?

33:52.880 --> 33:54.880
Thruxton is the fastest
racetrack in Europe.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.600
So that's where I took
the new McLaren.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.000
NASA ARCHIVE:
Engine's beginning
throttling down now.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.480
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:02.520 --> 34:04.520
And lift-off.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.840
..clear of the tower.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.320
Go with throttle up.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.120
JEREMY:
This is the car in question.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.960
And let's begin
by giving you
some of the headlines.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.640
There's no hybrid drive,
like there was in the P1.

34:29.680 --> 34:34.080
But even so, the 4 litre,
twin turbocharged V8...

34:35.360 --> 34:38.920
...produces 789 horsepower.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.160
And that means
it's still pretty fast.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.920
OK, right.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.600
Left foot on brake.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.280
(ENGINE REVVING)

34:55.320 --> 34:56.560
Push launch.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.280
Full throttle.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.640
Boost building, boost ready,
we're gone.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.760
0-60 in 2.7 seconds.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.520
That's 120...150.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.880
Jesus H Christ!

35:22.320 --> 35:25.880
It'll actually do 186
in 18 seconds,

35:25.920 --> 35:28.960
and flat out is 208.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.280
And that's really
alarming.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.480
I'm gonna be sick. Ohh!

35:34.520 --> 35:36.000
Whoa!

35:39.120 --> 35:43.760
The thing is, though, that
lots of supercars are as fast
as the McLaren these days.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.360
Some are even more powerful,

35:48.400 --> 35:51.160
and even more dramatic
to behold.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
But this is called the Senna.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.760
It's named after
Ayrton Senna,

35:57.800 --> 36:00.400
and Ayrton was not a man
who spent his evenings

36:00.440 --> 36:04.160
cruising around Harrods
at nine miles an hour.

36:04.200 --> 36:07.320
And nor was he a man
who spent much time
at drag strips,

36:07.360 --> 36:09.360
doing the standing quarter.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.680
No.

36:10.760 --> 36:14.440
Ayrton was a man who made
his name at places like this.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.640
Racetracks.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.600
This is what
the Senna was built to do:

36:27.160 --> 36:29.160
get round any track,
anywhere,

36:29.160 --> 36:33.360
faster than any other
road car ever made.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.440
To do this,
they had to make it light.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.400
And they have.
The doors, for example.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.880
Even though they have
windows in them here,

36:44.920 --> 36:50.000
so passers-by
can see the driver's
trousers,

36:50.040 --> 36:52.160
they only weigh
nine kilograms

36:52.200 --> 36:55.160
and that's less than
one of Kate Moss's arms.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.840
And then there's the seats.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.880
They only weigh
eight kilograms.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.920
I've eaten puddings
that weigh more than that!

37:03.040 --> 37:04.760
NASA: Go with throttle up.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.440
JEREMY:
Having got the weight out,

37:07.480 --> 37:10.760
the Senna's nearly
a quarter of a ton
lighter than the P1.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.840
They had to think about grip.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.320
They started with
a new type of Pirelli tyre

37:18.360 --> 37:22.560
that clings on like a panicky
child on a fairground ride.

37:22.600 --> 37:26.280
And then there's
this moving rear wing,

37:26.320 --> 37:28.640
which is somehow road legal.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.840
It actually hangs
from these pylons,

37:31.880 --> 37:33.880
rather than sits
on top of them,

37:33.920 --> 37:36.360
because that
improves downforce.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.280
I asked James May
to explain why,

37:39.320 --> 37:43.040
but I'm afraid,
after three hours,
I went into a deep sleep.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.520
The next most import thing
when it comes to lap times

37:48.560 --> 37:51.080
is how well it slows down.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.840
I was once in a 24-hour race
at Silverstone,

37:56.880 --> 38:00.560
driving a terrible
old diesel BMW

38:00.600 --> 38:05.640
and yet I could keep up with
a supercharged Jaguar XKR

38:05.680 --> 38:09.440
because I had better brakes.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.960
I'd look at him
getting to the end
of the Hangar Straight,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.200
thinking, "Why are you
braking now, you idiot?
You don't need to."

38:16.960 --> 38:21.160
And that is
this car's party piece.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.360
To show you
how well this car stops,

38:23.400 --> 38:25.400
I've organised a little test.

38:28.600 --> 38:32.760
Right, I'm currently driving
alongside a Jaguar F Type...

38:34.080 --> 38:35.440
...at 100 miles an hour.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.080
When we get to that
cone down there...

38:40.360 --> 38:42.160
...we're both going to brake.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.600
Ready?

38:50.520 --> 38:52.520
(TYRES SCREECHING)

38:59.440 --> 39:02.480
(CHUCKLES)

39:02.520 --> 39:05.880
How can you stop from
100 miles an hour to nothing
in that distance?

39:09.800 --> 39:14.040
So, it stops like
it's run into a wall...

39:14.080 --> 39:17.040
...it's pressed into
the road by witchcraft...

39:18.520 --> 39:20.880
...it weighs the same
as a bag of whippets...

39:22.440 --> 39:26.880
...and it has nearly
800 horsepower on tap.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.440
Put all that together
and...um, well...

39:35.760 --> 39:37.760
Oh, my giddy aunt! (LAUGHS)

39:45.320 --> 39:49.440
It doesn't have
the savagery of the P1.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.000
The P1 was so scary,

39:53.040 --> 39:57.160
it took me two months
to get used to it,

39:57.200 --> 40:00.160
to discover
its little foibles.

40:00.160 --> 40:04.920
This, though, even though
I'm now in hunkered-down,

40:04.960 --> 40:07.080
tightened-up,
vicious race mode,

40:07.120 --> 40:10.120
with the traction control
wound right back,

40:11.360 --> 40:13.360
I'm not frightened at all.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.480
I'm starting to push the
envelope after 20 minutes.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.520
(ENGINE REVVING)

40:23.640 --> 40:27.760
But you see, through there,
the P1 would have
understeered.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.160
This just doesn't because

40:30.160 --> 40:33.480
there's no weight
to push it out of line.

40:33.520 --> 40:37.480
It's like you're driving
using nothing but telepathy.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.120
(TYRES SCREECH)

40:46.760 --> 40:48.760
And I'm loving it! (LAUGHS)

40:52.880 --> 40:55.120
In the past, I've
described various Ferraris

40:55.160 --> 40:57.800
as feeling
beautifully delicate.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.320
But compared to this,
they're like elephants!

41:06.760 --> 41:07.880
Criticisms?

41:07.920 --> 41:11.200
Not many, I mean,
the usual McLaren stuff.

41:11.280 --> 41:14.600
When you try to
change it from comfort
to track to sport to race,

41:14.640 --> 41:17.120
it's all far too complicated.

41:17.160 --> 41:22.120
And I know they saved
15 kilograms not fitting
air conditioning,

41:22.160 --> 41:25.960
but on a hot day like today,
it's quite sweaty.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
But who cares?

41:39.400 --> 41:44.480
Honestly, this thing
is rewriting the supercar
rule book, in my mind.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.200
-(CHEERING)
-Unbelievable car, that.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.480
I'm actually proud
to be British with that.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.880
What?

42:09.280 --> 42:11.280
-Yes, definitely.
-What?

42:11.320 --> 42:15.440
Well, just...while the film
was on we've just been online
and checked.

42:15.480 --> 42:18.200
Thruxton is not
the fastest track in Europe.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.120
-What?
-It's not.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.000
-Why isn't it?
-Well, it isn't
the fastest track.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.840
Well, it's the fastest
racetrack in Wiltshire.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.880
-It's in Hampshire.
-You don't even know--

42:26.920 --> 42:29.520
-It's in Hampshire.
You don't know where it is.
-You don't even know that!

42:29.560 --> 42:33.920
They described themselves
as the fastest track
in the South of England.

42:33.960 --> 42:37.160
-Not Europe.
-After Brexit it'll be
the fastest in Europe.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.200
Anyway, whatever,
back to your film.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.680
You said "rewriting
the supercar rule book".

42:41.760 --> 42:43.600
Those are big words.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.040
Yeah, and they're correct.

42:45.080 --> 42:47.760
-Are they?
-No, they are. No,
for once, I am actually...

42:47.800 --> 42:49.760
First time this show
I'm right.

42:49.800 --> 42:54.320
Because that car... You
remember the Lamborghini
Huracán Performante?

42:54.360 --> 42:56.880
-I loved that car.
-OK, that blitzed our track.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.640
Absolutely blitzed it,
fastest road car ever
round there.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.880
I can guarantee
the Senna will be quicker.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.440
-Guaran--
-Here we go again. Good.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.160
I promise it will be.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.400
I promise.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.600
If it isn't, can we blow up
your house?

43:10.640 --> 43:12.000
(LAUGHTER)

43:12.040 --> 43:13.800
I haven't finished
building it yet.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.080
Well, when you've
finished building it,
can we blow it up?

43:16.120 --> 43:18.040
Yes.

43:18.080 --> 43:21.600
No, I am so confident
the Senna will be faster,

43:21.640 --> 43:25.520
that if it isn't, when I've
finished building my house,
you can blow it up again.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.960
You do know that we will?
We will do that.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.160
-We will do that.
-We will.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.920
We'll wait till you're in.

43:33.280 --> 43:36.160
Let's play the tape, come on.
Let's have a look.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.600
There's Abby, and she's off,

43:38.640 --> 43:41.280
flying away from the line
like a stabbed rat.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.320
And coming onto
the Isn't Straight.

43:43.360 --> 43:47.720
Already carrying
some serious speed.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.600
Looking busy at the wheel
on the bumpy surface
of our track,

43:50.640 --> 43:53.680
but those hydraulically
interconnected dampers
are doing their job

43:53.720 --> 43:55.320
of keeping it all tied down.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.080
Oh, that is flying!

43:59.120 --> 44:01.840
She's already dropping down
into Your Name Here.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.000
(TYRES SQUEAL)

44:03.040 --> 44:05.840
Some squeal from
the Pirelli P Zero Trofeos

44:05.880 --> 44:08.480
as she carves round there
and then it's back on the gas

44:08.520 --> 44:11.640
to unleash
that mighty twin turbo V8

44:11.680 --> 44:13.560
for the return run
down to the Isn't.

44:13.600 --> 44:17.040
I am feeling confident here!

44:17.080 --> 44:19.840
Right, now hard on those
incredible carbon ceramic
brakes

44:19.880 --> 44:24.320
for the tight, and technical,
Old Lady's House.

44:24.360 --> 44:28.320
No excess weight
to drag the nose wide.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.200
And now, on the fast run
to Substation,

44:31.240 --> 44:33.680
riding the ruts
and lumps with ease.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.720
Two corners left.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.080
More tyre squeal
through there,

44:38.120 --> 44:40.120
rear wing
doing its thing.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.880
And now a bit of oversteer
and across the line.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.600
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

44:44.640 --> 44:47.320
Looks good,
it does look good.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.480
But...

44:50.920 --> 44:52.320
Got everything we need
to blow it up?

44:52.360 --> 44:54.120
There it is, there's the
Huracán Performante.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.040
1.16.8.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.160
And I have guaranteed
it'll be faster

44:58.200 --> 44:59.560
or you'll blow
my house up.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.200
And you're doing well on
facts this week, so far,
aren't you?

45:02.240 --> 45:04.040
How are you feeling?

45:04.080 --> 45:06.840
-Totally relaxed.
-Are you really?

45:06.880 --> 45:08.480
-(MOUTHS)
-(LAUGHTER)

45:08.520 --> 45:11.160
Thing is, we
haven't got far to go
to blow it up, have we?

45:11.200 --> 45:12.440
It's just gonna be
over there.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.360
Come on, let's see
how fast it was.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.720
RICHARD: Oh, oh...

45:17.760 --> 45:19.760
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)

45:19.800 --> 45:22.280
-Damn!
-1:12!

45:23.480 --> 45:24.640
JAMES: That is serious.

45:26.040 --> 45:29.880
That's four
seconds quicker.

45:29.920 --> 45:32.640
That's quicker than the
Vulcan, and the Vulcan
isn't even road legal.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.920
That's absolutely amazing.

45:34.960 --> 45:38.000
That is astonishing
and we can add it to the list
of things that you know.

45:38.040 --> 45:40.240
(LAUGHTER)

45:40.280 --> 45:43.960
-Anyway, we must
now get back to our film.
-Yes.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.080
Earlier on, we decided
that Detroit should be

45:47.120 --> 45:49.840
a big sort of
petrolhead theme park,

45:49.880 --> 45:53.280
so we went over there with
three tuned muscle cars.

45:53.320 --> 45:57.240
So far we've staged a drag
race, done some doughnuts

45:57.280 --> 45:59.760
and Jeremy has driven over
some vegetables.

45:59.800 --> 46:04.960
And then the next day, we
decided that what Detroit
really needs is a racetrack.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.360
Yeah, even though
it already has two.

46:07.400 --> 46:09.400
Yes, but we wanted
something more earthy.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.920
So we headed
for the city centre.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.160
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

46:31.360 --> 46:34.360
As we headed
for the downtown area,

46:34.400 --> 46:37.680
I decided to do a bit of
muscle car housekeeping.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.680
Can I just ask everybody
what your average
fuel consumption

46:42.720 --> 46:45.680
has been
since we got to Detroit?

46:45.720 --> 46:49.600
Overall, over the whole trip,
eight mpg.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.280
Yeah, mine is a healthy
3.9 miles per gallon.

46:54.600 --> 46:56.640
You're joking? 3.9?

46:56.680 --> 46:58.200
Yes, siree Bob.

46:59.240 --> 47:02.800
13 mpg from the Mustang.

47:02.840 --> 47:05.240
Is it a hybrid?

47:05.280 --> 47:08.480
(LAUGHS)

47:08.520 --> 47:11.480
If it had been a hybrid,
it would have fitted in
very well

47:11.520 --> 47:15.160
with what the centre of
Detroit has become
these days.

47:18.560 --> 47:21.440
Florist...cafés...

47:21.480 --> 47:25.040
Oh, for heaven's sake,
Urban Ramen!

47:25.080 --> 47:27.080
No, no, no, no!

47:29.280 --> 47:33.720
In 1997,
in downtown Detroit,

47:33.760 --> 47:36.920
someone put a gun
against my head.

47:36.960 --> 47:42.640
Now it's just all hipsters
with dogs and bicycles.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.800
If you want
to start a tech business,
bugger off to San Francisco.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.800
Oh, for God's sake,
have you seen this
little urban garden?

47:51.840 --> 47:54.360
Oh, no.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.840
Why has he got such
a problem with gardens?

47:56.880 --> 47:59.080
Look down there,
it's just all greenhouses

47:59.120 --> 48:01.840
full of little
artisan...soaps.

48:02.960 --> 48:04.320
There's a Tesla!

48:04.360 --> 48:06.760
There's a bloody Tesla
in Detroit!

48:06.800 --> 48:09.440
If only the world
were full of people
like Jeremy Clarkson.

48:09.480 --> 48:12.240
Then we could have
slavery and witch burning.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.600
JEREMY: Right,
well, we've established
one thing.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.880
The centre of Detroit...
that ain't a racetrack,

48:17.920 --> 48:19.920
that's a wholefood market.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.600
We need to get out of here,
this is the enemy.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.400
Having returned to
the rundown suburbs,

48:29.440 --> 48:33.520
we eventually found
the perfect place
to build a racetrack:

48:36.880 --> 48:39.880
Cadillac's old
Conner Avenue Factory.

48:42.600 --> 48:46.480
For over 60 years,
they stamped out
the body panels here

48:46.520 --> 48:50.600
for icons, like
the Eldorado, the Fleetwood,

48:50.640 --> 48:52.640
and the Coupe de Ville.

48:56.320 --> 48:59.240
If it were up to James,
this creaking monument

48:59.280 --> 49:03.440
to the Motor City's decline
would be turned into
a shrubbery.

49:06.080 --> 49:08.080
But it wasn't up to James.

49:08.120 --> 49:11.840
So it would become a Monte
Carlo-style tunnel feature

49:11.880 --> 49:14.560
on our Detroit-themed
racetrack.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.760
Right, so what I
thought we'd do is

49:19.800 --> 49:22.440
we'd name all of the corners
and all of the straights

49:22.480 --> 49:25.840
after various musicians
who are from Detroit.

49:25.880 --> 49:30.960
So, for example, put that
there, and then this
would be Alice Cooper Corner.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.160
-Yeah, nice touch.
-And I've got all the faces.

49:33.200 --> 49:36.240
I've got Glenn Frey from the
Eagles, Jack White, Madonna,

49:36.280 --> 49:38.040
Aretha Franklin, Bob Seger,
Ted Nugent.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.560
What's that stick for?

49:39.600 --> 49:42.720
Oh, that's um...
that's Iggy pop.

49:42.760 --> 49:45.040
-Oh, yeah,
it's like he's here.
-Yeah, exactly.

49:45.080 --> 49:48.080
Then as we go into
the back section over there,

49:48.120 --> 49:51.600
you've got Marvin Gaye,
Stevie Wonder, Eminem,
Diana Ross,

49:51.640 --> 49:54.320
Sonny Bono, Martha Reeves,

49:54.360 --> 49:56.720
Anthony Kiedis,
Smokey Robinson.

49:56.760 --> 49:58.520
You look in the book
and you just go...

49:58.560 --> 50:00.680
"They can't all be
from Detroit!"

50:00.720 --> 50:02.600
Did you know Madonna
was from Detroit?

50:02.640 --> 50:04.160
No.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.160
Because building the track
involved heavy machinery

50:10.200 --> 50:12.040
and manual labour,

50:12.080 --> 50:15.560
Hammond insisted on
doing everything himself.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.600
That is gonna be
a fast corner.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.640
(BLEEPING)

50:23.680 --> 50:27.040
Despite this, though,

Sonny Bono.

Yes, Hammond, Sonny Bono

50:53.120 --> 50:56.400
and The Edge from the famous
Detroit rock band U2.

50:56.440 --> 50:58.080
Exactly.

51:00.880 --> 51:05.000
Because the track
had been built by the world's
most accident-prone driver,

some constructive feedback.

-It's challenging, isn't it?
Technical.

It's only about that much
bigger than the car

52:21.320 --> 52:22.840

1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:21.440
That's good to go.

1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:24.760
JEREMY:
Sadly, though, it wasn't.

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:28.440
He's now refuelling
his car with a special...
How many octane?

1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:31.840
It's ethanol and gasoline
mixture...um...104.

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:35.520
JEREMY: After the refuelling,
we hoped he was done.

1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:38.480
But, no.

1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:39.920
Right, hang on a minute.
I've got to put it

1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:41.920
in neutral to get
that in the middle.

1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:44.000
Hammond, you're taking
the whole dashboard off.

1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:47.360
This has to come out
because I'm gonna put in
a new control panel here.

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:48.920
I get a new button on it.

1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:52.360
He's taking the whole
centre console out,
the whole of that.

1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:55.280
He's had to put it in
neutral to lift it all off.

1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:56.680
What for?

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:58.960
Because you can then fit
a button, that enables him

1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.680
to select what sort of fuel
he's running on.

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:05.360
Why don't they just put
that in from the start?

1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:09.960
This all goes back in here,
with my new switch gear in.

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.120
It's an hour
and seven minutes.

1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:14.560
Actually, you're right,
it is. It's over an hour now.

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:16.240
God!

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:18.280
-There we go.
-(BLEEPING)

1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:25.400
JEREMY: Finally, the rebuild
of the Demon was complete.

1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:28.520
It was time for the drivers
to warm their tyres.

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:32.920
In three, two, one, burn out!

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:34.920
(ENGINES REVVING)

1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:50.320
Right, your tyres are warm.
Are you now ready?

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:53.480
-What?
-Are you ready to come
to the start line?

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:55.520
-No!
-What do you mean, no?

1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:58.280
-No, that was just
a celebratory burnout.
-Oh, jeez, he's got out.

1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:00.880
I've done all the building
work, now I've
gotta set the car up.

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:03.440
I've gotta get in
the right modes,
there's stuff to do, mate.

1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:05.120
Oh, I've had enough.
I'm sorry, I've had enough.

1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:06.960
Bye.

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:08.960
(SIGHS)
We're never gonna do this.

1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:13.880
So, I need to go into Drag.
Drag Mode Activating.

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:16.240
Excellent. Drag Transmission,
Drag Traction, Power.

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:20.400
So Power
needs to go up to 840.

1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:22.240
We are now in High Octane.

1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:23.720
Ho-ho!

1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:25.600
I've never known
anything like it.

1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:27.920
JAMES: With our starter
on his way back to London,

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:29.400
the traffic lights
were brought in,

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:32.520
and finally
we were ready to go.

1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:38.640
I'm gonna bust your ass,
evil boy!

1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:41.040
Oh, yes.

1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:42.600
What are you gonna
do with it now?

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:44.480
Cos I've seen the film
and I wouldn't do it.

1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:53.520
(ENGINES REVVING)

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:07.920
I'm getting ahead!
I think I'm getting ahead!

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:09.640
Come on, Demon!

1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:19.080
Argh, so annoying!

1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:24.280
Urghh!

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:27.200
Aha! Evil wins!

1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:29.120
Evil wins! Woo-hoo!

1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:37.240
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-Ye-e-e-s!

1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:38.880
Yes!

1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:40.920
Victory for the Demon.

1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:42.640
Thank you. Ha-ha!

1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:44.680
-Cos I won.
-Yes, you won.

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:47.040
-You did win. Well done.
-You noticed, then?

1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:48.360
-Yes, I noticed it.
-That I won?

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:49.920
At the end of
the race, my car

1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:52.200
was in front of your car,
which means I won.

1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:54.760
Can I just point out, first
you had to spend half a day

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:57.920
rebuilding half your car,
and then you had to run it
on fuel

1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:00.760
that you can't buy from
a normal petrol station.

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:06.600
Wait a minute, your Excrement
runs on that clever
fuel all the time.

1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:08.720
I was sort of banking on
you not knowing that.

1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:10.880
-Yes, well, I do know.
-Gentlemen, gentlemen.

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:14.960
I think we have to agree,
the Mustang is the only car

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.560
here that ticks
all the muscle car boxes.

1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:20.840
It's cheap, it's powerful,
it runs on fuel you can buy,

1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:23.840
and you can have it
with the steering wheel
on the correct side.

1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:26.440
You don't get it, do you?
You just don't get it.

1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:28.800
A muscle car is supposed to
have 1,000 horsepower,

1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:31.440
be undriveable
and have a stupid name.

1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:33.880
It's called Ready To Rock!
That is a stupid name!

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:36.600
Listen, Hammond, not only
are you the fiscal brain
of this operation...

1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:38.280
I am.

1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:41.120
...you're also the resident
muscle car enthusiast, yes?

1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:45.320
So, and I know the answer to
this, cos you told me on
the plane on the way home.

1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:47.120
Of the three cars, which
would you actually buy?

1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:48.440
-Buy?
-Buy.

1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:49.720
-With my own money?
-Yes.

1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:51.760
-Buy? Myself?
-Yes. Yes.

1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:54.480
-It's the Mustang.
-There you go, the Mustang.

1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:57.400
And so on that terrible
disappointment for you...

1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:00.600
-Snowflakes.
-...it's time...
it's time to end.

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:03.920
Now, next week it
is a Grand Tour Special,

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:08.280
where we attempt to
become the first ever
television show

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:09.920
in the history of television

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:13.240
to go to Colombia
and not use the C-word.

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:15.280
See you then. Goodbye.
