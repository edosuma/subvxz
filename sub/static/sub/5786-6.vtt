00:00.877 --> 00:02.462
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.671 --> 00:04.422
- Have you called?
- You have a gambling problem.

00:04.631 --> 00:06.049
Telly was sent to collect
on your gambling debts?

00:06.257 --> 00:08.093
You thought you could
disappear Telly's body

00:08.301 --> 00:10.929
but first you had
to get his body past
the security cameras.

00:11.137 --> 00:13.348
I didn't kill Mike.
We have a fixer
that works at our firm.

00:13.556 --> 00:14.933
I had no idea that was
part of his plan.

00:15.141 --> 00:18.061
Son turns father
into a member
of the undead.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.230
- What is it you want?
- Your entire company.

00:20.438 --> 00:23.358
And I'm gonna stick you
in the same hellhole
where you stuck grandpa.

00:23.566 --> 00:26.236
Says here
you were slinging
for Stacey Boss.

00:26.444 --> 00:29.197
I need everything
you can tell me about
Mr. Boss' crime organization.

00:29.364 --> 00:30.281
Mrs. Suzuki.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.616
I found this.

00:31.825 --> 00:32.951
I didn't know
what to make of it.

00:33.159 --> 00:34.411
I, I know all the risks,

00:34.619 --> 00:35.829
and all the reasons
it can't work.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.038
But I don't care.

00:37.247 --> 00:38.415
I want us to be
together again.

00:45.171 --> 00:46.423
Whoa! Eggs!

00:50.719 --> 00:52.053
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.

00:54.639 --> 00:55.557
<i>♪ Feel it ♪</i>

01:04.149 --> 01:05.942
What's shakin', bacon?

01:06.651 --> 01:09.070
Body snatchers?

01:09.279 --> 01:11.573
If that's Rihanna
coming downstairs,
it'll explain so much.

01:13.867 --> 01:15.994
Morning, everyone.

01:16.202 --> 01:19.164
Wait, wait, wait.
Is this happening?

01:19.372 --> 01:20.832
It's happening.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.251
About damn time.

01:23.460 --> 01:25.628
But it won't always be
this nauseating, right?

01:25.837 --> 01:27.756
Suffer, bitch.

01:39.517 --> 01:40.810
Detective!

01:43.021 --> 01:46.232
Look, I know you're bummed
the judge ignored
your warning,

01:46.441 --> 01:48.943
but he's right,
I'm no flight risk.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.570
Why would I run?

01:50.779 --> 01:52.614
I got the plea deal
of the century.

01:52.781 --> 01:54.657
Any tips on how
to best enjoy freedom?

01:54.866 --> 01:57.077
Try Mike Hayden's funeral.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.870
All those kids he coached
should be there.

01:59.079 --> 02:01.331
I was thinking something
more like golf.

02:01.539 --> 02:02.916
Enjoy prison, Mr. Cole.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.210
Minimum security.

02:05.418 --> 02:07.670
I hear they just reseeded
the back nine.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.145
Did you and Major have sex?

03:05.353 --> 03:07.939
Whoa. Aren't Brits supposed
to be repressed?

03:08.148 --> 03:10.150
What would Judi Dench say?

03:10.358 --> 03:12.777
She'd say we don't know a lot
about the sexual transmission
of zombie-ism.

03:12.986 --> 03:15.697
Er, in this version,
Judi Dench
knows about zombies.

03:15.905 --> 03:17.323
Did you and Major have sex?

03:17.532 --> 03:19.284
- No.
- Good.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.619
Not yet. You know,
people with HIV...

03:21.828 --> 03:22.954
- You don't have HIV.
- Still,

03:23.163 --> 03:24.789
- condoms should be...
- Let's hope.

03:24.998 --> 03:26.624
But let me run
a few tests first, okay?

03:26.833 --> 03:28.793
- Okay.
- You can hold off
for a few days?

03:29.002 --> 03:30.170
Maybe.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.671
- Yes.
- Miss Moore,

03:31.880 --> 03:33.298
can I borrow you for
a few minutes?

03:33.506 --> 03:34.799
There he is.

03:35.008 --> 03:36.843
- The man of the hour.
- Man of the hour?

03:37.051 --> 03:39.304
We've been pulling bullets out
of Mr. Cole all day.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.097
We heard you were inches away.

03:41.306 --> 03:43.808
Yards away.
Nothing heroic about
not getting shot.

03:44.017 --> 03:45.643
Well, did you soil yourself?

03:45.852 --> 03:47.478
- No.
- Then it's heroic in my book.

03:48.688 --> 03:50.231
- Thanks?
- Hmm.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.984
Our first move's clear.
We know our late friend here

03:53.193 --> 03:55.403
was about to be
the star witness
in a murder trial.

03:55.612 --> 03:57.655
So the guy he sold out
is either very lucky

03:57.864 --> 04:00.575
or very guilty
of commissioning the murder
of a witness.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.911
I've got him upstairs,
let's go.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.204
Wait, now?

04:04.412 --> 04:06.206
I haven't eaten yet.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.708
Well, grab something out
of the vending machine
on your way up.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.127
I was kinda hoping
for something
more substantial.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.842
You've billed on dozens
of cases, Mr. Thrunk.

04:18.051 --> 04:20.136
But when I looked
at the court records,
you know what I found?

04:20.345 --> 04:21.971
Detailed history
of court cases?

04:22.180 --> 04:25.016
I found that you haven't been
in a courtroom in nine years.

04:25.225 --> 04:28.019
You've got a nice office
for a lawyer who doesn't
practice law.

04:28.228 --> 04:31.522
I practice enough to know
when detectives are fishing.

04:31.731 --> 04:33.274
Maybe,

04:33.483 --> 04:36.319
but I've got
a couple of bites.

04:36.527 --> 04:40.365
I know that when Harry Cole
was being shaken down
by a lowlife,

04:40.573 --> 04:43.076
Telly Levins, he killed him.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.328
Then he called you
to clean up his mess.

04:45.536 --> 04:49.415
But the night security guy
saw you with the body.

04:49.624 --> 04:51.501
So now you had a problem.

04:51.709 --> 04:54.462
See, back when Harry
was alive, he told us
that's your real job,

04:54.629 --> 04:56.673
fixing problems.

04:56.881 --> 04:59.509
And Harry swore that
when Mr. Hayden
became your problem,

04:59.717 --> 05:01.052
you fixed him.

05:01.261 --> 05:03.554
And that,
with Harry's tragic passing,

05:03.763 --> 05:05.640
is inadmissible hearsay.

05:06.516 --> 05:07.600
Anything else?

05:10.228 --> 05:12.730
I'll take that wordless
exchange as a no.

05:12.939 --> 05:15.316
Look, Detective,
how did I order this hit?

05:15.525 --> 05:18.236
I was in jail.
Eyes on me the whole time.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.989
I only made one call,
to my colleague,

05:21.197 --> 05:23.241
which I'm sure was recorded.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.410
Did you hear me order a hit?

05:25.618 --> 05:27.662
Oh, we heard something.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.747
<i>Give Marie and Walt
my Seahawks tickets.</i>

05:29.956 --> 05:31.708
<i>I won't be out in time.</i>

05:31.916 --> 05:33.084
<i>And one more thing.</i>

05:33.293 --> 05:34.711
<i>Take care of Mr. Sheldon.</i>

05:34.919 --> 05:36.963
<i>Use the usual guy.</i>

05:37.171 --> 05:39.132
Who's Mr. Sheldon, Roger?

05:40.758 --> 05:42.593
Figure it out.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.470
You figure
"take care of Mr. Sheldon"

05:44.679 --> 05:46.097
is code for
"murder Harry Cole"?

05:46.306 --> 05:48.057
If it is, and we can prove it,

05:48.266 --> 05:51.144
Marie and Walt will
be catching a lot more
Seahawks games.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.813
I'm also tracking
the motorcycle.

05:54.022 --> 05:55.565
Here's where
the shooting took place.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.276
They took off heading north.

05:58.484 --> 06:00.778
A mounted officer saw them
fly by right here.

06:00.987 --> 06:02.238
Heading toward the water.

06:02.447 --> 06:04.198
What if they dumped
the bike in the Sound?

06:04.407 --> 06:06.701
I requested frogmen.
We'll see if it leads
to anything.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.453
It's gotta be Roger Thrunk,
doesn't it?

06:08.661 --> 06:10.038
We already know
he's a murderer.

06:10.246 --> 06:12.040
Let's not forget Harry
owed someone enough money

06:12.248 --> 06:14.083
that a goon was sent
to collect.

06:14.292 --> 06:15.835
The man's
a degenerate gambler.

06:16.044 --> 06:18.504
That was kind of his dominant
personality trait, huh?

06:20.631 --> 06:21.883
This is gonna get ugly.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.645
Suzuki's widow
gave you a brain?

06:34.854 --> 06:35.813
Yeah.
In a piece of Tupperware.

06:36.022 --> 06:37.357
Like she was handing me cake.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.775
And you think it's human?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.361
I do.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.863
But I can't ask our lab
to test it without saying
where it's from,

06:44.072 --> 06:46.866
and I'm already
in the doghouse
for looking into Suzuki.

06:47.075 --> 06:48.618
I can send it into
the FBI lab.

06:48.826 --> 06:49.911
Where is it now?

06:51.079 --> 06:52.038
It's in my freezer.

06:53.081 --> 06:54.916
Your freezer?

06:55.124 --> 06:57.210
What chain of custody protocol
includes your freezer?

06:57.418 --> 06:58.920
I didn't know what the hell
to do with it.

06:59.128 --> 07:01.506
The whole thing is nuts.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.549
And get this.

07:03.758 --> 07:06.636
A guy I think is connected
to the Meat Cute murders

07:06.844 --> 07:08.679
kept going on about brains.

07:08.888 --> 07:09.806
What guy?

07:11.808 --> 07:13.226
The guy walking toward us

07:13.434 --> 07:16.145
holding hands with the psychic
I told you about.

07:16.354 --> 07:18.398
Oh, no.
Abort. Just turn around.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.525
I'm already waving,
that would
be incredibly weird.

07:20.733 --> 07:21.651
Nut up.

07:24.362 --> 07:25.530
Hey, you.

07:25.738 --> 07:27.615
Didn't know you existed
outside the station.

07:27.824 --> 07:30.326
I thought you were
just put back in
your Detective Clive box.

07:30.535 --> 07:31.619
Pull his string and he says,

07:31.828 --> 07:32.995
"Miss Moore, please."

07:34.914 --> 07:38.126
Liv, Major.
This is Agent Bozzio
from the FBI.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.752
Dale. It's nice to get a name.

07:39.961 --> 07:41.421
In my head you've been, um,

07:41.629 --> 07:43.381
"Girl from the morgue
who somehow makes goth work."

07:43.589 --> 07:45.716
Oh, that is her
Native American name.

07:45.925 --> 07:47.802
Hi, I'm
Barely Employed Arm Candy.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.345
No. I'm Major.

07:49.554 --> 07:50.471
You certainly are.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.559
So, the FBI sent
you to Seattle?

07:54.767 --> 07:56.102
How're you finding it?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.353
Ten bucks says you miss.

07:58.146 --> 07:59.272
What? From here?

07:59.480 --> 08:00.773
I'm automatic
from this distance.

08:00.982 --> 08:03.067
Put your money
where your mouth is, then.

08:03.276 --> 08:04.569
Now you're thinking about it.

08:04.777 --> 08:05.736
I'm in your head.

08:05.945 --> 08:07.321
I mean, seriously? Ten bucks?

08:07.530 --> 08:09.574
That is the sound of
a man's sphincter shrinking.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.033
Ah, it's your money.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.495
Pay up.

08:14.704 --> 08:16.747
What? I just made you look
good in front of your date.

08:16.956 --> 08:18.082
You should be paying me.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.418
- Oh, wait, this isn't a...
- It's not?

08:20.626 --> 08:22.336
Why did I pay, then?

08:22.545 --> 08:24.213
- You're saying that
I'm not getting any or...

08:24.422 --> 08:27.258
It's good to see
you two together.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.093
Last I heard,
you were broken up.

08:29.302 --> 08:30.428
And now we're not.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.224
Seems like romance
is in the air.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.560
Nice to meet you.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.399
He's not going to let
the Meat Cute thing go.

08:43.608 --> 08:44.859
He's got the FBI involved now?

08:45.067 --> 08:46.944
No. That's not why she's here.

08:47.153 --> 08:49.113
Oh. Okay. Well, good.

08:49.322 --> 08:51.824
No, she's looking into all
those abduction cases.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.410
Abduction cases?

08:54.619 --> 08:56.120
All those rich guys
that keep disappearing?

08:56.329 --> 08:57.788
It's all over the news.

08:57.997 --> 09:01.209
The Feds think it's some
Manson-y kill-the-rich nut.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.465
He was frugal in life.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.759
Perhaps in death
it's finally time he made
a bold statement?

09:11.427 --> 09:13.346
- Blaine.
- I'm discussing statuary, Don.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.598
We've got customers.

09:15.806 --> 09:16.724
Downstairs.

09:29.654 --> 09:32.156
- Son.
- Dad.

09:32.365 --> 09:36.619
I'd hoped your first visit
here would be more...
Horizontal.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.829
I'm afraid I've
got some bad news.

09:41.249 --> 09:43.209
Ah.

09:44.669 --> 09:46.087
You work for me now.

09:48.506 --> 09:49.966
Chief, you had one job.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.978
You're gonna need a bigger box
for your employee here.

10:02.186 --> 10:05.940
We usually just
chop off the feet.
Nobody looks down there.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.818
What do you know
about the Titans?

10:09.026 --> 10:11.529
Perennial AFC South
underachievers.

10:11.737 --> 10:15.408
The money I could've saved
on private schools.

10:15.616 --> 10:19.036
Cronus, king of the Titans,
ruled the universe.

10:19.245 --> 10:22.331
A prophecy said he'd
be overthrown by his son.

10:22.540 --> 10:26.168
Each time his wife
produced one, he'd kill it.
Know how?

10:26.377 --> 10:27.628
Bored them to death?

10:27.837 --> 10:28.921
He ate them.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.799
Ah! You're hungry.

10:32.008 --> 10:34.135
I've got a special
on color-blind electrician.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.804
Nothing in ungrateful
parasite?

10:37.013 --> 10:38.139
What? Me?

10:38.306 --> 10:39.807
Zombie brains don't
do the trick.

10:39.974 --> 10:41.309
Every zombie knows this.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.853
Yes, but you're no longer
a zombie, are you?

10:44.061 --> 10:47.231
The last time you dropped
by my office, I was ready.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.608
I had you followed.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.360
That woman who does
your makeup?

10:51.569 --> 10:55.031
Tsk. She has a low
threshold for pain.

10:55.239 --> 10:59.327
I know all the names
on your client list.

10:59.535 --> 11:04.081
That pounding in your ears
is the sound
of your leverage evaporating.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.169
I am the new CEO here.

11:11.339 --> 11:12.381
You love being human.

11:12.590 --> 11:14.258
The food. The sex.

11:14.467 --> 11:15.968
You always were a hedonist.

11:16.177 --> 11:18.012
You're built for it, so...

11:18.220 --> 11:21.432
You'll do what I say,
when I say it, or...

11:22.600 --> 11:24.852
Back to Zombieland for you.

11:25.019 --> 11:25.978
Got it?

11:27.355 --> 11:28.397
Excellent.

11:31.609 --> 11:33.110
Here's your first job.

11:33.319 --> 11:34.487
Mark Jarrett.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.906
A rival of mine.
Needs taking care of.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.741
You want his brain?

11:38.949 --> 11:40.534
Help yourself
to some trade secrets?

11:40.743 --> 11:43.913
His son's, actually.
He's the heir apparent,
in on everything.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.831
So, I get the trade secrets

11:46.040 --> 11:48.668
and the bonus of emotionally
devastating my rival.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.002
Oh.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.463
So this guy loves his son?

11:52.672 --> 11:55.216
The boy's vacationing
on Mount Rainier.

11:55.424 --> 11:58.010
A remote cabin.
Should be easy pickings.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.263
Well, get to it.

12:01.472 --> 12:03.140
Knock out this assignment

12:03.349 --> 12:06.018
and there's an employee
of the month trophy
with your name on it.

12:06.227 --> 12:08.521
Not even interested
in how I was cured, huh?

12:08.729 --> 12:11.273
Why would I be?

12:11.482 --> 12:13.401
Immortality suits me.

12:18.781 --> 12:22.743
Does this step on your plans
to have me carted off
to a nursing home?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.166
Oh! Holy crap!

12:29.375 --> 12:32.336
Chief, buddy. You're okay!

12:32.545 --> 12:34.046
Dude, he's not okay.

12:34.255 --> 12:35.715
He's so far from okay.

12:41.762 --> 12:42.888
I'm taking maple bar.

12:43.097 --> 12:45.099
You can have the field.
Double or nothing.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.434
You already owe me ten bucks.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.352
Did you not hear me say
double or nothing?

12:52.231 --> 12:54.984
These are a decade
of Harry Cole's e-mails,

12:55.192 --> 12:57.236
old yearbooks,

12:57.445 --> 13:00.322
anything that might help us
make a connection
from Mr. Sheldon to Harry.

13:00.531 --> 13:03.075
I've reached out to Harry's
widow, but she hasn't gotten
back to me yet, so...

13:03.284 --> 13:04.410
Damn it, Wilkins!

13:05.578 --> 13:07.037
Let's roll this one over.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.956
Next donut out of the box
has sprinkles.

13:09.165 --> 13:10.624
Mm-mm. Pay up.

13:13.294 --> 13:15.921
<i>Time to pay up, Harry.
Barber's done waiting.</i>

13:19.508 --> 13:22.052
I know that look.
What'd you see?

13:22.261 --> 13:25.055
Telly, the collections guy,
was threatening Harry,

13:25.264 --> 13:26.640
telling him to pay up.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.226
He said the barber's done
waiting for his money.

13:29.435 --> 13:31.270
How poetic is it that
a barber sends a thug

13:31.479 --> 13:33.147
to collect from
a guy named Harry.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.565
How expensive are haircuts,
anyway?

13:34.774 --> 13:36.317
Ah. Not a barber.

13:37.318 --> 13:39.111
The Barber.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.114
Operator of one of
the biggest books in town.
Dangerous cat.

13:42.323 --> 13:43.991
Why's he called The Barber?

13:44.200 --> 13:47.036
Okay, that's the Lions, Bama,
Garcia for the tease...

13:49.455 --> 13:50.831
There's a lot of Tigers
out there, man, you've got
to be more specific.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.875
It's gonna be about
an hour wait, son,

13:53.083 --> 13:56.295
but I will give you a fade
so polished
that it will blind you.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.345
Got it, all set.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.180
We're here about the murder
of Harry Cole.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.182
Gunned down
on the courthouse steps.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.975
My, my, my.

14:10.184 --> 14:13.229
So, what brings you here?

14:13.437 --> 14:16.482
Oh, for a start, he owed
you $75,000.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.735
Not to mention, he caved
in your collection guy's skull
with a baseball bat.

14:19.944 --> 14:21.570
Yeah, yeah, listen, guys,
let me tell you about that...

14:21.779 --> 14:24.156
Use hypotheticals
when you answer.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.742
They're inadmissible.

14:26.951 --> 14:29.203
How long you think I've been
doing this, Counselor?

14:29.411 --> 14:30.329
Hmm?

14:32.748 --> 14:35.417
Let's just say that
Harry owed me big.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.586
Let's say he even
killed my employee.

14:37.795 --> 14:38.879
Hypothetically.

14:39.088 --> 14:41.549
What do you think
"let's say" means? Huh?

14:41.757 --> 14:43.759
So, you think the smart play

14:43.968 --> 14:48.514
is to spray downtown
with bullets in
broad daylight, hmm?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.683
Is that how
a smart businessman operates?

14:50.891 --> 14:52.893
Ah, could be.

14:53.102 --> 14:55.896
Anyone else who owed
that smart businessman money
would be quick to pay.

14:56.105 --> 14:58.023
From what I read in the paper,

14:58.232 --> 15:02.111
I'd be looking at the guy
your vic was going
to testify against.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.446
I'd take that guy,
what's his name, Roger Thrunk?

15:04.655 --> 15:06.282
Against the field.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.076
Yeah, yeah, I kind
of like the widow,
myself, though.

15:09.285 --> 15:12.830
You know, degenerate
gambler husband
destroying their future.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.291
Maybe there was
a life insurance policy.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.002
- You ever think of that?
- The moron's on the damn rail!

15:20.754 --> 15:23.966
Listen, if I happen
to be right,
and the widow is flush,

15:24.174 --> 15:26.635
you have her to drop on by
and see me, okay?

15:26.844 --> 15:30.848
What odds are you giving
on the notorious bookie
Harry owed money?

15:31.056 --> 15:33.267
Man, I don't even have
a motorcycle license.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.727
Hypothetically.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.854
Literally.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.480
Thread the needle, baby!
That soft grass is nothing,
it's nothing.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.195
Gotta admit. Life insurance,
not a bad angle.

15:45.404 --> 15:47.698
You and murderous
spouses, Clive.
Never get married.

15:47.907 --> 15:49.450
It's just Harry's widow
keeps dodging my calls.

15:49.658 --> 15:50.868
Even if she's innocent,
she could help us on

15:51.076 --> 15:52.995
- the Mr. Sheldon...
- I forgot my sunglasses.

15:55.456 --> 15:58.375
Give me Alas Poor Yorick,
Edison Lighthouse
and Filly Cheesesteak

15:58.584 --> 16:00.461
in a trifecta box in
the third at Saratoga.

16:00.669 --> 16:01.670
This feels like entrapment.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.380
How much are we talkin' about?

16:03.589 --> 16:05.132
$24.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.551
And yeah, Filly Cheesesteak's
a female in a male field,

16:07.760 --> 16:09.178
but she's breaking from
a single-figure draw,

16:09.386 --> 16:11.555
she's a demon on mud
and we both know

16:11.764 --> 16:13.682
you don't bring in a jockey
like Santiago if you're just
there for the juleps.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.726
Take it.

16:18.312 --> 16:19.980
Oh.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.565
Silver dollar. Make it 25.

16:21.774 --> 16:24.777
That silver dollar.
Is that a Susan B. Anthony?

16:24.985 --> 16:27.363
Then you keep it.
Those things are lucky.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.086
I've got that lucky
feeling today, Doc.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.046
Give me some good news
on the safe sex research.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.714
Oh, nothing certain yet,

16:45.923 --> 16:47.424
though I have proven that when
you purchase boxes

16:47.633 --> 16:49.677
of every brand of condom
available at once,

16:49.885 --> 16:51.595
the lady at the drugstore
counter looks at you funny.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.723
Is that a balloon animal?

16:56.225 --> 16:58.435
Ah, yeah, clown college.

16:58.644 --> 17:00.688
Um, I'm available for parties.

17:00.896 --> 17:03.107
I tracked down Harry's widow,
but we've got to hurry.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.566
Where are we going?

17:04.775 --> 17:06.652
Shady Plots Funeral Home.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.737
Harry's memorial service
is happening right now.

17:08.946 --> 17:12.074
If anyone needs to know
where I am, you be sure
to let them know.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.617
Will do.

17:17.955 --> 17:21.083
Harry would've loved
to have seen you all here.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.794
He was a man who leaned
on his friends and

17:24.003 --> 17:25.963
he wanted to be a man
others could lean on...

17:26.171 --> 17:27.881
I feel dirty showing up here.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.509
If she'd called me back,
we wouldn't have to be.

17:30.718 --> 17:31.719
I've got some morgue business

17:31.927 --> 17:33.303
to talk to the
funeral director about.

17:33.512 --> 17:34.805
I'll be back.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.739
<i>Hola, mi amigo.</i>

17:51.947 --> 17:53.115
<i>Como estas?</i>

17:53.323 --> 17:54.908
Join me for my last meal.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.911
My partner is upstairs,
the detective who has
a sketch of you

17:58.120 --> 17:59.538
and wants to talk
about Meat Cute.

17:59.747 --> 18:01.206
So you need to stay down here.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.834
Not that I think you could
climb these stairs.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.294
Mwa mwa mwa mwa.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.880
Mwa mwa mwa.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.923
That's what you sound like.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.134
Yes, I received
the good doctor's call.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.677
Yes, I'll stay downstairs.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.722
Are you ever happy
you're a zombie?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.724
You should know
that's a stupid question.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.559
Is it?

18:20.768 --> 18:24.354
Before I became a zombie,
I was wasting my life.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.190
Human Blaine was a nobody.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.818
An underachiever.
He was a, he was a joke.

18:30.027 --> 18:32.404
Zombie Blaine, though...

18:32.613 --> 18:33.906
Zombie Blaine was the man.

18:34.114 --> 18:38.118
- He was a murderer.
- But he was exceptional.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.370
Kinda miss that guy. And you?

18:40.579 --> 18:42.456
Would you have ever become,
uh, Liv Moore,

18:42.664 --> 18:45.542
dispenser of justice,
if I hadn't scratched you?

18:45.751 --> 18:47.419
There's a part of you
that loves it.

18:47.628 --> 18:49.171
You're important now.

18:49.379 --> 18:53.008
Admit it.
I gave you a gift.

18:53.217 --> 18:55.511
What about the visions?
Miss those?

18:55.719 --> 18:57.888
Seeing the worst moments
of people's lives,

18:58.097 --> 19:00.349
never knowing when you're
going to experience the terror

19:00.557 --> 19:02.810
of feeling like you're
about to die?

19:05.979 --> 19:08.232
Enjoy your hangover.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.111
Are you suggesting
that I killed my husband
for an insurance payout?

19:12.319 --> 19:15.030
It's the first question
they teach us
in detective school.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.740
I'm sorry if
it sounds indelicate.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.158
There was no insurance.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.494
All Harry's money went
to his addiction.

19:20.702 --> 19:24.289
As far as you know,
did anyone ever refer to
your husband as Mr. Sheldon?

19:24.498 --> 19:26.792
They couldn't have
taught that question
in detective school.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.210
He's was called many things.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.920
Mr. Sheldon wasn't
one of them.

19:30.129 --> 19:31.839
I'll be damned.

19:32.047 --> 19:34.174
Calvin Owens.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.385
He and Harry
were college buddies.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.805
I saw him put up a 30-20 on
the Knicks in the Garden
his rookie season.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.765
- Are we done here?
- Yeah.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.767
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Cole.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.227
Thank you.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.108
We should probably
go talk to Calvin.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.735
You look like me going
to see NSYNC when I was 10.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.654
Is this guy a big deal?

19:55.863 --> 19:58.323
Not one week ago
you were dissecting
the triangle offense

19:58.532 --> 20:01.785
and now you know nothing about
one of the greatest players
of his generation?

20:01.994 --> 20:03.829
I know he's good looking.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.248
We probably should
go talk to him.

20:12.504 --> 20:13.672
Mr. Owens,

20:15.924 --> 20:18.051
Clive Babineaux, Seattle PD.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.265
Do you mind if I ask you some
questions about Harry Cole?

20:23.473 --> 20:25.601
Doubt I know anything
relevant, but sure.

20:25.809 --> 20:28.145
Harry's widow said
you and Harry
were college buddies.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.355
Yeah. We met
our freshman year.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.233
So he was probably there when
you crushed Duke
in the round of sixteen?

20:33.442 --> 20:35.402
God, that was sweet.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.571
Probably.
He went to most games.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.741
Um...

20:40.949 --> 20:43.118
Can you think of anyone
who might want to hurt Harry?

20:43.327 --> 20:45.162
Aside from what's already
in the news?

20:46.914 --> 20:48.707
- Not really.
- All right.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.125
Well, if that's all...

20:50.334 --> 20:53.420
Oh, yeah, um, that's...
That's it.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.133
Do you want to talk
about basketball?

20:58.342 --> 21:00.636
I just have to ask
about Ewing.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.346
I mean,
you played him in his prime.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.431
He was a great player.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.391
If his knees
would've held out...

21:06.600 --> 21:08.810
We're talking
multiple Knicks titles.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.646
See, that's what
I'm always saying.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.356
- Uh...
- On another front,

21:12.564 --> 21:14.316
who you got
for the college championship?

21:14.524 --> 21:16.485
If someone were thinking
about making it interesting?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.820
You'd be crazy
if you didn't take Arizona.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.572
If you don't mind,
I have a car waiting.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.116
Oh, of course.
But before you go,

21:23.325 --> 21:25.827
can I see the ring?
I mean, up close.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.746
Yeah, no problem.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.626
<i>Go home, Harry.</i>

21:32.834 --> 21:33.835
<i>Do you want
my blood on your hands?</i>

21:34.044 --> 21:35.712
<i>I've given you all I can.</i>

21:35.921 --> 21:38.006
<i>You don't know what
these psychos will do to me!</i>

21:38.215 --> 21:39.132
<i>Calvin.</i>

21:44.263 --> 21:46.932
Should I tell you the vision
I just had or do you need
a minute?

21:49.184 --> 21:51.353
I'm good.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.355
Harry was asking
Calvin for money.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.274
He was terrified someone
was going to kill him.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.317
Seems to point to the Barber.

21:57.526 --> 21:58.568
What was Calvin's answer?

21:58.777 --> 22:00.237
He said he'd given enough.

22:03.407 --> 22:04.491
Yes!

22:06.618 --> 22:08.203
Nice.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.372
Trust me, if Harry knew what
it was about, he'd approve.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.042
Gentlemen.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.503
Well, if it isn't
Filly Cheesesteak.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.716
Get the lady her prize.

22:27.889 --> 22:30.726
You interested in turning
that little into a lot?

22:30.934 --> 22:34.062
Got a special
on San Antonio-Golden State.

22:34.271 --> 22:37.190
You're not getting
better than 150,
San Antonio's at home.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.360
150 on San Antonio at home?
I'm in.

22:40.569 --> 22:43.113
Hey, Officer,
since you're here,
you got any scoop on the case?

22:43.322 --> 22:44.865
None that I can give out.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.784
First thing, I think we cross
off any underworld figures

22:47.993 --> 22:50.120
given the theatrical nature
of the crime.

22:50.329 --> 22:53.081
Jimmy Hoffa.
That's the way a pro does it.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.125
Hypothetically.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.919
No, no, no.
<i>Strangers on a Train.</i>

22:58.128 --> 22:59.588
There's your perfect crime.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.340
No, no, no. Perfect murder?

23:01.548 --> 23:03.759
You get the guy you want
to get rid of to kill himself.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.385
You just ask real nice?

23:05.594 --> 23:07.554
Hypothetically...

23:07.763 --> 23:10.140
You just Skype the guy
you want done.

23:10.349 --> 23:13.769
He answers, and there
on camera, he sees his wife,

23:13.977 --> 23:17.689
his family, his dog, whoever,
with guns to their head.

23:20.192 --> 23:22.486
You make it clear
that it's him or them.

23:23.779 --> 23:25.781
Believe me, he'll do it.

23:33.121 --> 23:36.792
Gotta hit the road.
Places to go, people to see.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.674
What about the wife
and the family?

23:46.176 --> 23:48.053
You've got yourself witnesses.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.263
Guess you gotta
get rid of them, too.

23:51.807 --> 23:52.849
Hypothetically.

24:07.656 --> 24:08.907
Hello?

24:17.332 --> 24:18.708
Hello?

24:37.144 --> 24:38.687
Hey!

24:38.895 --> 24:39.980
You can't be in here.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.492
There. That's better.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.294
Would it surprise you to know
that I've been here before?

25:02.502 --> 25:05.046
In a district attorney's
office?
Not a big shock, no.

25:05.255 --> 25:07.257
Four times.

25:07.466 --> 25:10.969
Every few years some DA
gets it in his or her head
to make a run at me,

25:11.178 --> 25:14.264
so I swing by to talk about
how things can go.

25:17.476 --> 25:19.394
Are you threatening me?

25:19.603 --> 25:21.521
Gosh, no. Actually...

25:21.730 --> 25:24.232
Three of those former DAs,
they're doing great.

25:24.441 --> 25:27.277
They fell into some money,
retired young,

25:27.486 --> 25:29.404
fabulous PPO health insurance

25:29.613 --> 25:32.365
that pays for contact lenses
and teeth whitening.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.783
And the fourth DA?

25:34.743 --> 25:36.411
Escapes me.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.247
I see.

25:39.456 --> 25:42.417
You're attempting to bribe
an assistant
district attorney.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.045
Add that to the illegal
ex parte communication,

25:45.253 --> 25:46.588
I might have enough
to bring you back in here

25:46.796 --> 25:48.924
to see the place
during work hours.

25:49.132 --> 25:52.135
You are not lacking
for pluck, huh?

25:52.344 --> 25:55.096
And I admire the work ethic.
The late hours.

25:55.305 --> 25:57.766
And this wall thing?

25:57.974 --> 26:01.895
But it is a little
out of date.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.272
So maybe you only
have one source?

26:04.481 --> 26:06.858
Who left my employ
about two years ago?

26:07.067 --> 26:10.529
I wonder who.
And I wonder what happens
to your case

26:10.737 --> 26:12.072
if he goes away?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.366
It's time for you to leave.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.369
This is quite the gig
for someone two years
out of law school.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.746
The DA pulled you out
of sabbatical, right?

26:19.955 --> 26:22.624
So with a continent full
of experts on drug law,

26:22.832 --> 26:26.711
racketeering, and so on,
he opted for a 27-year-old.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.757
Maybe his heart's
not quite in this.

26:33.218 --> 26:35.428
Or maybe it's the pluck.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.234
Remember him?

26:49.442 --> 26:51.695
This is the turtle
on Roger Thrunk's desk.

26:51.903 --> 26:54.155
That's right.

26:54.364 --> 26:57.742
I suppose he looks more like
a Mr. Sheldon than Harry.

26:57.951 --> 27:00.787
We had a forensic team going
through everything
in Thrunk's office

27:00.954 --> 27:03.248
and some flunky showed up
wanting to feed the turtle.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.208
So that's what "take care
of Mr. Sheldon" meant.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.918
It was literal.

27:07.127 --> 27:09.879
He wasn't ordering a hit.
He was getting a pet sitter.

27:10.088 --> 27:12.048
Yeah, but things got weird.

27:12.257 --> 27:14.175
When forensics said
they needed to call in
and make sure it was okay

27:14.384 --> 27:16.011
with me, the flunky split.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.263
They didn't even get a name.
Why would he do that?

27:18.471 --> 27:20.807
I saw a movie once
set in a jungle prison.

27:20.974 --> 27:23.977
Prisoners wrote messages
on the bottom
of turtles' shells.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.273
Ah...

27:28.481 --> 27:33.486
The things they never tell you
you'll be doing
at the detective academy.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.239
Oh, boy.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.203
Babineaux!

27:42.412 --> 27:43.622
You and that turtle
get a room.

27:43.830 --> 27:44.873
I'm looking for messages.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.499
I won't ask.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.835
We think there's something
fishy about this turtle.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.670
This is all you, buddy.

27:50.879 --> 27:53.256
In <i>A Fish Called Wanda,</i>
they hid the key
in the treasure chest.

27:53.465 --> 27:55.925
Does anyone else have
any movie plots
that may apply?

27:57.385 --> 27:58.345
He doesn't have
a treasure chest.

27:58.553 --> 28:00.138
He's got a castle.

28:08.313 --> 28:09.522
There's something.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.490
Well, what do we have here?

28:18.698 --> 28:21.034
Looks like cocaine to me.

28:21.242 --> 28:24.412
So that's why Mr. Sheldon
wouldn't shut up about taking
me for a ride in his Porsche.

28:24.621 --> 28:28.124
I think we'll bring Roger
in tonight for another chat.
You in?

28:28.333 --> 28:30.168
Actually, I kinda have plans.

28:33.421 --> 28:37.092
Okay, two glasses of wine.
I think I'm ready.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.885
<i>Doesn't get any safer
than this.</i>

28:39.094 --> 28:41.221
We could just wait until
Ravi finishes his research.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.556
Nope. It's on.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.600
High card strips.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.727
Draw.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.979
- What did you get?
<i>- A two.</i>

28:50.188 --> 28:52.524
<i>Liar. Show your card,
Lilywhite.</i>

28:57.612 --> 28:59.239
<i>Read 'em and weep.</i>

29:02.283 --> 29:03.702
Slow down now. Make it a show.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.870
Hey, don't you dare make
me feel cheap.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.998
Come on. Everyone knows this
is how you put yourself
through college.

29:11.751 --> 29:16.089
Hey, how about a face card
means you provide
a little dirty talk?

29:16.297 --> 29:19.384
<i>We'll see. I may need
to finish this bottle first.</i>

29:19.592 --> 29:21.970
Wait. Let's show each other
at once.

29:22.178 --> 29:24.639
- Build some drama.
- All right.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.933
Three, two, one.

29:29.310 --> 29:32.188
<i>Well, luckily, I'm wearing
four pairs of socks.</i>

29:32.397 --> 29:33.690
<i>No, sir.</i>

29:33.898 --> 29:35.775
Full monty.
Give me the goods.

29:37.235 --> 29:38.611
<i>All right.</i>

29:40.488 --> 29:42.615
What? A G-string?

29:43.992 --> 29:45.118
Uncool.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.536
I play to win.

29:47.579 --> 29:49.247
<i>Now, draw, lady.</i>

29:49.456 --> 29:52.375
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

29:56.254 --> 29:57.672
Oh.

29:57.881 --> 29:59.466
Yeah.

30:15.482 --> 30:16.691
<i>All right. Yeah.</i>

30:16.900 --> 30:18.109
<i>That did the trick for me.</i>

30:18.318 --> 30:20.153
<i>Good night.</i>

30:25.909 --> 30:27.285
Mr. Thrunk.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.079
Guess I figured it out.

30:35.126 --> 30:37.170
Thanks for playing along.

30:37.378 --> 30:38.671
<i>It was fun.</i>

30:40.089 --> 30:41.674
It was.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.635
<i>I know it's not the same as...</i>

30:43.843 --> 30:44.719
That's okay.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.137
<i>You remember the last time?</i>

30:46.346 --> 30:47.514
You mean, the last time we...

30:47.722 --> 30:50.058
- That is what I mean.
- Yeah.

30:51.768 --> 30:54.729
Laundry room.
Your apartment building.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.981
We'd fought earlier about
how many of your teammates

30:57.190 --> 30:58.608
would get invitations
to the wedding.

30:58.817 --> 31:01.945
Make up sex. Good stuff.

31:04.113 --> 31:05.406
Just a couple more days.

31:06.658 --> 31:08.076
A couple more days.

31:18.253 --> 31:20.421
Congratulations, Officer.

31:20.630 --> 31:23.883
You've turned $24 into $1,500.

31:24.092 --> 31:27.887
I'm gonna let it ride
on Arizona to win it all
at 15 to one.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.055
Arizona?

31:31.015 --> 31:32.892
Fine. Your money.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.686
Soon to be my money.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.939
I have it on good authority
from an NCAA champion himself.

31:38.147 --> 31:39.399
And who might that be?

31:39.566 --> 31:41.192
Only Calvin Owens.

31:42.819 --> 31:43.862
What?

31:46.531 --> 31:48.116
Well, if there's someone
who would understand

31:48.324 --> 31:50.285
betting on
college basketball...

31:52.954 --> 31:54.455
<i>Bowman grabs the rebound,</i>

31:54.664 --> 31:56.916
<i>and it's a beautiful
outlet pass to Calvin Owens!</i>

31:57.125 --> 31:59.961
<i>He's going for the jam
and, oh, he can't
get it to go down!</i>

32:01.462 --> 32:03.172
- Hey.
- Caught you.

32:04.257 --> 32:05.842
I get it now.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.344
You sit down here and bone up
on a few basketball facts,

32:08.553 --> 32:10.513
then regurgitate them to me,
trying to show me up.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.473
You got me. What's up?

32:12.682 --> 32:15.435
Our frogmen did their dive,
they found the motorcycle.

32:15.643 --> 32:18.104
We traced it to a visiting
Serbian national.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.856
He and his brother were
on a flight back to Serbia

32:20.064 --> 32:22.692
less than three hours
after Harry Cole was shot.

32:22.901 --> 32:24.694
They've both
got violent records back home.

32:24.903 --> 32:28.489
So we infiltrate
a Serbian crime gang.
It's almost too easy.

32:28.698 --> 32:31.576
I'm pushing the DA
to extradite,
but it's a long shot.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.078
I'm sure they were guns
for hire.

32:34.287 --> 32:37.248
Enjoying some classic Calvin?

32:37.457 --> 32:38.958
Doing some homework.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.127
You remember their record
their championship season?

32:41.294 --> 32:42.962
Yeah, they only had
a couple of losses.

32:43.171 --> 32:45.882
35 and two.
Know what they were
against the spread?

32:46.090 --> 32:47.300
Six and 31.

32:47.508 --> 32:49.010
If Vegas is doing its job,

32:49.218 --> 32:50.845
most teams should be close
to.500 against the spread.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.805
Yeah, I know how
the spread works.

32:52.972 --> 32:56.768
Right. Well, Calvin had
a bad habit of getting
careless late in games.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.311
I think he was shaving points.

32:58.519 --> 33:01.314
And his college buddy
was a serious gambler.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.316
We need to talk
to Mr. Owens again.

33:03.524 --> 33:06.945
Find out if he's got
any connections to

33:07.153 --> 33:10.949
Nikos and Novak Slijepcevic.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.202
I'll find
how to pronounce that.

33:14.410 --> 33:15.578
You said it fine.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.915
You two are out
of your damn minds.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.001
I want my lawyer, man.

33:22.210 --> 33:25.421
You could do that.
Or you can just hear us out.

33:25.630 --> 33:26.756
You've been advised
of your rights.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.633
Remain silent if you like.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.010
I didn't kill anyone.
That's crazy.

33:31.219 --> 33:34.222
Crazy like how
your college team failed
to cover the spread

33:34.430 --> 33:36.557
80% of the time.

33:36.766 --> 33:40.812
You used to get the yips
pretty bad
in the closing minutes.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.189
Lots of pressure
at the end of games.

33:43.398 --> 33:45.316
What? No good under pressure,
Calvin?

33:47.986 --> 33:50.321
But in the pros,
those yips cleared up.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.991
Of course, by then you weren't
short of cash anymore.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.492
But your college buddy was.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.577
That's why
he was blackmailing you.

33:56.786 --> 33:58.621
"Pay off my debts,
or I'll tell everyone

33:58.830 --> 34:01.290
"about those games
we fixed back in college."

34:01.499 --> 34:03.835
You could've paid him off,
but you knew
that wasn't gonna end.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.379
Not with a degenerate
like Harry.

34:06.587 --> 34:09.048
So I jumped on the back
of a motorcycle and shot him?

34:09.257 --> 34:11.384
Think someone might've
seen a 6'7" shooter?

34:11.592 --> 34:16.681
The bike was registered
to the sons
of Goran Slijepcevic.

34:16.889 --> 34:20.059
You and Goran were teammates
in Milwaukee for two seasons

34:20.268 --> 34:23.938
until he was cut for pulling
a knife in a card game dispute
on a team flight.

34:24.147 --> 34:26.607
You reached out
to an old friend
to fix your problem.

34:28.276 --> 34:30.028
Mr. Owens.

34:30.236 --> 34:33.114
Peyton Charles.
I'm with the
district attorney's office.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.824
It would be
in your best interest
to confess.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.035
You think so, huh?

34:37.243 --> 34:39.495
Goran Slijepcevic has had
a pretty impressive
post-basketball career.

34:39.704 --> 34:41.456
He's a war criminal.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.416
Serbia's just
getting back their
international reputation.

34:43.624 --> 34:45.418
You think they'd risk that
to protect a family of thugs

34:45.626 --> 34:46.919
with ties to a genocide?

34:47.128 --> 34:48.963
We will get them extradited.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.549
How long do you think
it'll take for them
to roll over on you?

34:51.758 --> 34:55.386
Confess and I'll keep
you out of gen pop.

34:55.595 --> 34:56.888
There's lot of prisoners who
want to meet Calvin Owens

34:57.096 --> 34:59.057
and not all of them are fans.

35:14.489 --> 35:15.698
This one.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.326
This was my jam.

35:29.670 --> 35:33.508
You like the music,
don't you, Grandpa?

35:33.716 --> 35:37.470
Oh, it has been a hell
of a few days, Gramps.

35:37.678 --> 35:39.305
Turns out we have something
more in common

35:39.514 --> 35:42.475
than our good looks
and stellar musical taste.

35:42.683 --> 35:45.978
Dad has figured out a way
to take over my business, too.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.772
You're okay.

35:51.818 --> 35:55.238
What do you say
we teach him a lesson
this time?

35:55.446 --> 35:57.115
Let him know
what it feels like.

35:58.616 --> 36:02.161
Shh, just listen to the music.

36:11.337 --> 36:12.630
Yo, Angus.

36:13.673 --> 36:15.842
I've decided I'll do it.

36:16.050 --> 36:19.720
Yeah, I did have options.

36:19.929 --> 36:23.307
I'm heading to Mount Rainier.
You'll have the brain
you want by tomorrow.

36:49.292 --> 36:50.293
Shh.

36:53.212 --> 36:55.882
Just listen to the music.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.383
Just listen to the music.

37:06.142 --> 37:08.311
Did you know condoms have
a 98% success rate?

37:08.519 --> 37:11.022
I have heard
that stat somewhere.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.110
You gotta like those odds.

37:17.612 --> 37:18.946
No pressure.

37:22.450 --> 37:24.368
Come on. Come on.

37:47.391 --> 37:49.518
Oh, damn.

38:04.408 --> 38:05.826
Oh, no.

38:07.036 --> 38:09.497
No, no, no, no.

38:11.874 --> 38:13.084
Stop what you're doing!
I'm coming in!

38:13.292 --> 38:14.835
- Ravi? What?
- Wait! Ravi?

38:15.044 --> 38:16.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Knocking!

38:16.587 --> 38:17.964
In this house we use knocking.

38:18.172 --> 38:19.507
Are you decent?

38:19.715 --> 38:21.133
Decent enough.

38:22.510 --> 38:24.303
Tell me you haven't
had sex yet.

38:24.512 --> 38:26.055
Seems like a question
you could've asked
outside the door.

38:26.264 --> 38:27.306
- Have you?
- No.

38:29.100 --> 38:32.561
That's very, very good news.

38:32.770 --> 38:36.941
Zombie virus is a hundredth
the size of a typical virus.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.611
I tested every brand
of condom, every material,

38:40.820 --> 38:42.905
102 samples.

38:43.114 --> 38:45.908
Zombie virus went through
all of them.

38:46.117 --> 38:49.328
If you have sex,
Major will become a zombie.

38:49.537 --> 38:52.540
That is not a risk,
that's a certainty.

38:55.334 --> 38:58.337
Look, someday I'll cure it.
I will.

38:58.546 --> 39:00.881
But until then, I'm sorry.

39:02.258 --> 39:04.802
Thanks, Ravi. Really.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.523
There's other stuff.

39:17.732 --> 39:18.899
The other night was fun.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.777
It was.

39:21.986 --> 39:23.237
So we get creative.

39:23.446 --> 39:24.947
We're creative people.
We'll figure it out.

39:25.156 --> 39:26.949
Yeah. This isn't it for us.

39:27.158 --> 39:28.326
It's not.

39:30.578 --> 39:34.707
So, what are we doing later?
Wanna catch a G-rated movie?

39:36.417 --> 39:38.377
Ah, I've got work.

39:38.586 --> 39:40.212
Late night training sessions.

39:40.421 --> 39:43.382
- But tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. Great.

39:43.591 --> 39:46.135
- Foot rub?
- Yes.

39:46.344 --> 39:48.763
Wait, was that an offer
or a request?

40:29.845 --> 40:31.097
Dude, guess what?

40:31.305 --> 40:33.140
I'm reading the news
and then suddenly,

40:33.349 --> 40:35.601
your scary-ass pops
is staring at me.

40:38.312 --> 40:39.897
Someone kidnapped the guy.

40:42.191 --> 40:44.151
Gimme that.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.903
Just like
our other customers.

40:46.112 --> 40:47.238
I mean,
talk about luck, right?

40:52.368 --> 40:56.288
What are we listening to?
Can we turn this crap off?

40:56.497 --> 40:59.917
<i>The real
estate mogul's living room
was covered in anti-capitalist</i>

41:00.126 --> 41:02.294
<i>graffiti and violent
class warfare slogans,</i>

41:02.503 --> 41:07.007
<i>fueling speculation that
the perpetrators
are anti-corporate radicals.</i>

41:07.216 --> 41:10.511
<i>In other news,
the Seattle City Council
today approved a motion...</i>
