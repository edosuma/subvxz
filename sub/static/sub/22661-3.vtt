WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:06.307
There's my sexy gardener.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.641
Yeah.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.577
I like you in those
little green gloves.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.112
Oh, these old things?

00:11.145 --> 00:12.213
(chuckles)

00:12.246 --> 00:13.781
Just something I threw on.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.583
I'd already be done
if you let me

00:15.616 --> 00:17.451
use that weed killer
in the garage.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.287
I'm being punished
just because Teddy used to--

00:19.320 --> 00:23.291
and I repeat, used to--
lick the shrubs.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.259
Okay, well, everything's
looking good inside.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.695
The kids are cleaning their
rooms, I got the laundry done.

00:27.728 --> 00:31.065
Now, I just have to figure out
what that smell upstairs is.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.366
I smelled that, too.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.634
I didn't say anything
because I love you,

00:33.667 --> 00:35.603
and I thought it was you.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.307
Hey!

00:39.340 --> 00:41.509
That came
from Teddy's window.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.844
(scoffs)

00:43.877 --> 00:46.480
It's like a Dumpster back here.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.516
Well, now we know
how he cleans his room.

00:50.484 --> 00:54.255
And where the Funyuns went.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.623
I'm sorry I blamed you.
Mm-hmm.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.160
Throwing trash out the window?

00:59.193 --> 01:01.229
He gets that from
your side of the family.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.596
(scoffs)

01:02.630 --> 01:03.731
Don't overreact.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.133
I am not overreacting.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.601
I am reacting.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.171
Okay, but-but you got to
admit, for the most part,

01:10.204 --> 01:13.574
our-our kids are
pretty darn adequate.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.544
I mean, they
brush their teeth.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.446
Emme doesn't.
They-they do well in school.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.148
Teddy doesn't.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.815
They still hug us.

01:21.849 --> 01:22.850
Katie doesn't.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.188
Okay, well, Kate puts "XO"
at the end of her texts.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.357
That's a kiss and a hug.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.824
Yeah. To a robot.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.361
Okay, look. Look-look--
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.363
My-my parenting book says

01:35.396 --> 01:37.765
that the most effective
form of discipline

01:37.798 --> 01:39.900
if often just listening.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.269
Mm-hmm. I hate that book.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.871
Okay? I've hated it
ever since it said

01:43.904 --> 01:45.739
we should make
our own baby food.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.777
Please, please, just this once,
can we do it my way?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.912
Your way is to just yell.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.548
Yeah. And thanks to my dad,
I'm really good at it.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.186
Look, I think that we should
stick with my way,

01:58.219 --> 01:59.353
the book's way.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.321
(groans)
(stammers)
Let's just hear

02:00.354 --> 02:01.922
Teddy's side of the story.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.924
You always want to hear
the kids' side.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.826
I could tell you
right now: their side

02:05.859 --> 02:07.761
is they're lazy boneheads.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.532
I'm just saying that
there might be a problem

02:11.565 --> 02:13.267
behind the problem.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.569
Okay, the problem
is they're lazy.

02:15.603 --> 02:19.773
The problem behind the problem
is they're boneheads.

02:21.842 --> 02:25.279
Teddy, why would you dump trash
out the window?

02:25.313 --> 02:26.880
Why do you put the caps
from your beer bottles

02:26.914 --> 02:28.282
behind the couch pillow?

02:28.316 --> 02:30.684
I just...

02:30.718 --> 02:32.886
I get sleepy.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.188
(sniffing)

02:34.222 --> 02:35.289
You smell that?

02:35.323 --> 02:36.590
(sniffing)

02:36.624 --> 02:38.226
Is that the smell?

02:38.259 --> 02:39.360
(sniffing)

02:39.393 --> 02:41.962
I think that's just boy.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.499
You know, you get an allowance
to keep your room clean.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.968
And that includes
taking your trash outside.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.738
My room is clean,
and the trash is outside.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.741
(chuckles)

02:53.774 --> 02:55.909
Can I overreact now?

02:55.943 --> 02:58.312
Whoa, whoa.
Before you pop a vein,

02:58.346 --> 03:00.348
you might want to see
what's in Emme's closet.

03:02.283 --> 03:05.619
Hi, Emme, we just need to
check your closet real quick.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.987
You smell that?
(sniffing)

03:07.020 --> 03:08.556
Is that the smell?

03:08.589 --> 03:10.591
It's at least
part of the smell.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.595
Whoa! It hits you
right in the face.

03:14.628 --> 03:18.632
I think we just found
the house's butt.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.969
Emme, what is in
your shoe organizer?

03:22.002 --> 03:24.272
Is that broccoli?

03:24.305 --> 03:26.707
Yes, it is.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.644
I put it in there
so you think I ate it.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.514
Honey, keeping your room clean
and eating your broccoli

03:33.547 --> 03:35.015
are the two things

03:35.048 --> 03:36.917
you're supposed to do
for your allowance.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.486
I don't like broccoli.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.655
You make me eat it,
this is what happens.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.959
This is very,
very bad, Emme.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.497
It's not as bad
as what's in Kate's room.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.600
Well, I say we
board that closet up

03:52.633 --> 03:55.002
like a portal to hell and
never speak of this again.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.938
How did we not
know about this sooner?

03:57.971 --> 03:59.873
Well, we don't go in there
that much.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.643
Look, the kids get an allowance
to keep their rooms clean.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.479
The book says it's supposed
to foster responsibility.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.548
The only thing it's fostering
is botulism.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.351
Stop listening to that book.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.820
You agreed it had good ideas.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.688
I only agreed because you
asked me when we were in bed,

04:14.722 --> 04:16.524
and I wanted to fool around.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.759
Yeah, that's how I get you
to agree to things.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.362
That's your allowance.
(chuckles)

04:21.395 --> 04:23.297
You're no fool.
Hmm.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.699
Well, all right. Let's see
what's behind door number three.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.535
Hmm.

04:30.704 --> 04:31.972
Looks okay to me.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.307
Wait.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.908
I smell more smell.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.910
A lot more smell.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.012
(both sniffing)

04:40.080 --> 04:43.050
It's not me.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.852
(sniffs)
No, it's not me.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.587
(sniffing)

04:46.620 --> 04:47.988
Oh!

04:48.021 --> 04:49.423
The bed's wet.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.091
Katie's a bed wetter?

04:51.124 --> 04:54.328
That means therapy.
That'll cost a fortune.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.529
Well...

04:55.563 --> 04:58.098
Smell the bedspread and see.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.700
Uh, you smell it.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.103
Just, go-go and check
and see what's under there.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.672
(groans)

05:06.740 --> 05:09.843
Oh, it's old, moldy towels.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.545
Ugh.
Yep, that's the smell.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.681
That's the rest
of the smell.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.849
Ooh, check this one out.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.686
That's the queen of the hive.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.022
What are you doing?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.958
Right now? Wondering
where it all went wrong.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.428
Why are your old,
wet shower towels

05:27.461 --> 05:28.596
at the bottom of your bed?

05:28.629 --> 05:30.030
Oh. Every night, I get in bed

05:30.063 --> 05:31.865
with a towel on my hair.
Eventually, it falls off,

05:31.899 --> 05:33.100
and I just kick it
to the bottom.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.803
And you never
change your sheets?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.905
I thought you just changed them
every seven years.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.708
That's the mattress, Kate.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.142
Look, we give you

05:42.175 --> 05:43.977
an allowance to keep
your room clean.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.913
Well, now we know where
all our towels went.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.481
This morning,
I had to dry off

05:47.515 --> 05:49.717
by running around
the house like a dog.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.453
I mean, how can you
not smell that?

05:52.486 --> 05:53.921
I smell it.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.088
I'm just used to it.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.990
Got good to me.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.129
Well, at least I won't have
to pay for a wedding.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.432
Look, I'm not the only one
doing stuff.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.099
Do you know what Teddy
does with his trash?

06:06.133 --> 06:07.468
Yes, we do.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.036
How about Emme's closet?
Seen it all.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.638
Dad's beer caps?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.372
You're not getting
out of this, Katie.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.009
*

06:28.221 --> 06:29.590
Seriously?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.058
The parenting book again?

06:31.091 --> 06:33.126
Is the last chapter
just a picture of the author

06:33.160 --> 06:35.729
sitting on a pile of money,
laughing at us?

06:35.763 --> 06:38.899
She's a renowned
childcare expert.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.634
(groans)
Hey-- wait, wait,
listen to this.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.803
Uh, "About the Author.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.673
"Nancy is... single,

06:45.706 --> 06:47.675
and lives in Maine with her
beloved parakeet."

06:47.708 --> 06:48.842
What?

06:49.977 --> 06:52.680
Wait, she doesn't
even have kids?

06:52.713 --> 06:55.816
That's why she doesn't know you
can buy baby food at the store.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.819
I liquefied a perfectly good
salmon thanks to her.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.554
I can't believe this.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.690
I mean, uh, for 14 years,
this has been, like,

07:02.723 --> 07:04.692
my-my parenting bible.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.026
(scoffs)

07:06.059 --> 07:08.028
I hope her bird flies
into a ceiling fan.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.499
You know what?

07:11.532 --> 07:12.966
You're in charge now. Yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.967
Let's go Full Metal Jacket.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.168
Yeah?

07:15.202 --> 07:17.104
That's what I'm talking about.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.039
It's time to drop
an Adam bomb.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.108
Get it? 'Cause my name's Adam?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.843
Yeah, no. I got it.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.845
Yeah. Oh, I've been wanting
to use that for so long.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.779
(laughs)

07:25.813 --> 07:27.648
Come on.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.517
All right. Listen up.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.852
There's gonna be
some changes around here.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.253
Yeah. You're supposed
to handle your rooms,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.755
we handle everything else.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.591
But you blew it, so
now, you get this.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.527
It's all you, A-Bomb.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.996
All right.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.599
From now on, if you
don't do your chores,

07:45.633 --> 07:46.734
you don't get your allowance.

07:46.767 --> 07:47.935
Not one cent.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.271
(whistles)

07:51.304 --> 07:54.207
(imitates explosion)

07:54.241 --> 07:56.810
That was a bomb noise, kids.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.011
ADAM:
Which means

07:58.045 --> 07:59.913
you can't go the
mall and buy yo-yos

07:59.947 --> 08:03.617
and slingshots and
blacklight posters.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.887
I haven't been to
a mall in a while.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.091
We'd like a moment to discuss.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.693
What? What are you talk--
what do you mean?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.862
There's no discussing.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.865
You just got flattened
by a bomb!

08:17.898 --> 08:20.534
Okay. Here's
what we do: nothing.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.770
If we give in now,
our free ride is over.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.171
But won't they get mad?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.139
Look, you.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.977
I've been lowering
their expectations for years.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.281
I will not let you
mess it up for me.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.649
Capisce?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.551
What does that mean?

08:39.086 --> 08:40.854
"Understand"?

08:40.888 --> 08:43.757
How can I understand if you
won't tell me what it means?

08:44.992 --> 08:47.961
Teddy, just do what she says.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.734
So, we've discussed
your offer.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.968
Take it or leave it.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.704
We've decided to leave it.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.039
What? No, there's no leaving it.
You have to take it.

08:59.072 --> 09:03.110
Look, we know you love us too
much to stop giving us money.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.914
You're good people.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.583
Nuh-uh.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.986
We do-- do good people
watch Breaking Bad? Hmm?

09:14.855 --> 09:17.858
Yeah. 'Cause we watched one.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.994
It's a gamble we're
willing to take.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.698
So, we're going on strike.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.834
Capisce?

09:30.137 --> 09:33.140
Did he just capisce me?

09:33.173 --> 09:36.810
(whistles)

09:36.844 --> 09:38.145
Nothing.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.015
LOWELL:
You took away their allowance

09:42.049 --> 09:43.350
and they still won't
do their chores?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.718
Yeah.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.086
So guess who had
to make their beds

09:46.119 --> 09:47.955
and take out
their trash?

09:47.988 --> 09:49.222
Andi.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.991
And that put her
in a bad mood,

09:51.024 --> 09:53.360
which put me in a bad mood.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.863
I guess now's not
the time to tell you

09:55.896 --> 09:58.766
I lightly rear-ended you when
I was parking this morning.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.169
No, it's not.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.804
Okay. We'll put a pin in it.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.908
Kids are terrible
at chores anyway.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.910
Little hands can't fold towels
the way I like.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.145
It's fold, fold, flipsy, flopsy.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.181
That's a man's job.

10:14.214 --> 10:17.284
It's a symptom
of a bigger problem.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.186
We've lost our authority.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.989
When we were kids, our
parents had the power.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.858
But now that we're parents,
the kids have the power.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.327
We've never had the power.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.397
I think it all started
with sugary cereal.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.165
All we got
for breakfast

10:32.199 --> 10:33.433
was plain oatmeal.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.035
You know?
That put you in your place.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.938
You were barely more important
than a horse.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.173
Yeah, yeah. You know what
we never heard from Dad

10:40.207 --> 10:41.308
when we were kids?

10:41.341 --> 10:42.943
"How do you feel?"
Yeah.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.946
I heard, "How does that feel?"
Yeah.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.347
And, "You're gonna feel that
for a while."

10:47.380 --> 10:49.917
Yeah, yeah.
I remember that.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.319
I'm starting to think it didn't
hurt him more than it hurt us.

10:52.352 --> 10:56.323
I just, I-I don't know how
to get through to these kids.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.891
You should talk to Dad.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.192
He's always had the power.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.794
He's the reason
I don't stick up for myself

11:00.828 --> 11:02.029
and I'm grateful for that.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.698
Yes, Dad.
Yeah.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.200
That man ruled with an iron fist

11:07.234 --> 11:09.036
from the comfort
of his Barcalounger.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.370
All he had to say was,

11:10.403 --> 11:13.006
"Don't make me get up,"
and we never did.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.943
He'll get those
kids in line.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.011
You guys are really getting me
fired up.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.047
I'm sick of my kids
running my house.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.915
I'm not gonna put up
with it anymore.

11:21.949 --> 11:25.252
Tonight, I'm gonna ask them
for more power.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.990
Dad, uh, we need to talk to you

11:30.023 --> 11:31.892
about a situation
we're having.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.226
Take a bath together.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.796
That spiced it up
for me and your mom.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.167
That's gonna
stick with me.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.236
Uh, n-no, no, Dad.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.738
That's not the problem,

11:44.772 --> 11:47.040
but we should do that.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.409
Hey, there's my Teddy Bear.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.078
Hey, Grandpa.
Huh?

11:51.111 --> 11:52.412
You couldn't spare
a few dollars

11:52.445 --> 11:55.082
for a guy who's down
on his luck, could you?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.951
Teddy, you want
your allowance,

11:57.985 --> 11:59.953
take out the trash.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.354
Nah, I'll let you do it.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.193
You see that right there?
That's the problem.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.228
If you'd talked to me like that
when you were a kid,

12:08.261 --> 12:10.130
I would've taken the trash out
with you in it.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.533
Yeah, well, it's not just Teddy.
It's all of them.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.269
There are ways to make kids
do what you want.

12:16.303 --> 12:20.273
Yeah, but, Dad, your ways
aren't legal anymore.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.777
That was only one tool
in the toolbox.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.146
You two have
a structural problem.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.214
You're too soft on them.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.918
Yeah. You-You're always
asking them how they feel.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.223
You have to make them
fear the consequences

12:36.256 --> 12:38.291
of not doing their chores.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.228
You can't be afraid
to ruin their lives a little.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.897
Remember when you
wouldn't make your bed?

12:43.931 --> 12:44.965
What did I do?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.867
You took my bed.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.535
You didn't.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.103
I damn well did.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.006
But he makes his bed
now, doesn't he, huh?

12:53.040 --> 12:55.042
Yeah, huh? You're welcome.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.445
He's right, he's right.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.446
We need to up our game

12:59.479 --> 13:02.049
and make their lives a
little less comfortable.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.184
This is how we get
the power back.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.219
I just, I don't want them
to be unhappy.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.055
Don't worry about that.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.523
Unhappy children is how you know
you're doing a good job.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.863
Good morning.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.065
Your mother and I have realized
that we made a mistake

13:18.098 --> 13:20.834
with this whole
chore situation.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.536
Told ya.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.239
We've been too soft on you.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.943
Uh-oh.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.145
Yeah, we've been thinking
about this, uh, strike of yours

13:32.179 --> 13:34.347
and it's actually
a great idea.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.616
So until you agree to start
pulling your weight around here,

13:36.649 --> 13:39.252
we're going on strike.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.954
ADAM:
That's right.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.956
Instead of us doing
all the work,

13:42.990 --> 13:44.157
you're gonna do it,

13:44.191 --> 13:46.126
and we're gonna do nothing.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.262
You're gonna do the
dishes, the laundry,

13:49.296 --> 13:53.233
keep the kitchen
clean and, and...

13:53.266 --> 13:56.870
you're gonna do
it all for free.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.540
We trusted you.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.511
And that allowance money
that you're not getting,

14:04.544 --> 14:06.213
we're gonna use it
to buy ice cream

14:06.246 --> 14:08.115
and then eat it
in front of you.
Mm-hmm.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.118
And we're gonna get
all those goofy flavors

14:11.151 --> 14:14.187
you like and we hate just to
make it harder for you to watch.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.657
Oh, and I almost forgot.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.094
Here's your breakfast.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.395
Enjoy your oatmeal.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.365
That's right.
We'll be in the tub.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.483
We've only been
on strike three days

14:43.516 --> 14:46.253
and it looks like...
somebody took our house

14:46.286 --> 14:48.155
and shook it
like a snow globe.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.560
Yeah, there's no
place to sit.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.195
Sitting's our
favorite thing.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.497
Yeah, but think about it.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.333
If it's getting to us,
it's got to be getting to them.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.002
(keys jangling)
Ooh, ooh, here they come.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.071
Okay, let's close this deal.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.507
Hey, guys.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.077
How was riding the
nasty old school bus?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.444
Yeah, we're on strike.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.447
We don't pick you
up. That's rough.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.616
The bus is awesome.
I sat next to an older kid

15:16.649 --> 15:18.285
who taught me
about the dark web.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.655
You guys are really okay
with this mess?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.324
Yeah, I mean,
this place looks

15:24.357 --> 15:25.658
like the morning
after Burning Man.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.997
Doesn't bother us if
it doesn't bother you.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.004
Oh, it doesn't bother us.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.671
No, no, no.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.974
You wish it bothered us!

15:41.008 --> 15:42.976
It bothers me so much, Andi!

15:43.010 --> 15:46.113
I-I can't take it anymore.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.147
What are you talking about?

15:47.180 --> 15:49.116
It's gross in here!

15:49.149 --> 15:52.419
Those lunch boxes have not been
emptied since tuna fish day.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.288
Tuna fish, Andi!

15:55.322 --> 15:57.657
Sitting right under
the heating vent.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.993
If whatever that grows into
learns how to open the lid,

16:00.027 --> 16:02.762
it's gonna kill us
in our sleep.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.132
Wh-Whoa, whoa. Wait-wait
a minute, wait a minute.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.766
You got me into this.
You can't give up.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.569
Why not?
I never get to give up.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.638
It looks fun.
I want to try it.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.473
Oh, hey, hey.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.275
How about let's both
do it, huh?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.644
You're always saying you want
to do more stuff together.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.780
Come on. Think of all the
battles that we've quit on.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.016
All right? The-the
bedtime battle,

16:23.050 --> 16:24.351
the-the junk food battle,

16:24.384 --> 16:26.119
the flushing the
toilet battle.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.321
We were all losers
that day.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.025
And all because we
never stick with it.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.027
This is where we
draw the line,

16:34.061 --> 16:36.229
just like that line that
Teddy drew on the wall

16:36.263 --> 16:37.264
that we never
punished him for.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.433
(groans) I painted over it,
but I can still see it

16:40.467 --> 16:41.768
when the sun hits it right.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.104
God, it makes me crazy!

16:44.137 --> 16:46.173
Yes, yes. Use that anger.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.507
Embrace the dark side.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.176
Okay. Okay,
we'll stick it out.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.344
And when it works, I'm gonna
write my own parenting book

16:51.378 --> 16:53.146
and call it
Take That, Bonehead!

16:53.180 --> 16:54.547
By Adam "A-Bomb" Burns!

16:57.850 --> 16:59.386
I need to sit down.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.361
(water running, clattering)

17:10.597 --> 17:12.632
Adam, did you hear that?

17:14.101 --> 17:16.336
Adam?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.738
(fly buzzing)

17:26.113 --> 17:28.481
(laughs)

17:32.119 --> 17:33.586
Adam!

17:33.620 --> 17:36.489
(stammers)
It's not what you think.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.058
I'm, uh, I'm having an affair.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.497
You broke the strike.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.865
You-you surrendered.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.500
You're-you're like a, like a,

17:47.534 --> 17:50.103
like a Frenchman.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.838
I can't live like this anymore.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.640
We got flies, Andi.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.109
And I'm pretty sure something
in the bottom of the sink

17:56.143 --> 17:57.777
just grabbed my hand.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.747
I am so disappointed in you.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.582
Oh, come on. Don't do that.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.151
It's just, I got...

18:04.184 --> 18:07.254
Wait a minute.
What are those?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.689
Who washed the
kids' lunch boxes?

18:11.424 --> 18:14.194
Guess the kids did.
We won.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.528
Let's go back to bed.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.298
Not so fast, Jean-Pierre.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.467
Ugh. All right, you caught me.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.135
Uh, hey.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.870
Let's do your thing
and give up, huh?

18:23.903 --> 18:26.339
We can, we can give up together
in the tub.
No.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.342
No. The tub is for winners.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.346
(scoffs) Look at us.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.582
We went on strike to make
the mess the kids' problem

18:35.615 --> 18:37.417
and we ended up just
punishing ourselves.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.451
Well, you're right.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.153
I mean, at this point,

18:40.187 --> 18:42.622
their rooms are probably the
cleanest ones in the house.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.228
You know what? They are.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.598
And we are finally gonna
make this mess their problem

18:51.631 --> 18:53.500
because I just got an idea.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.338
Okay, babe, everyone's home
from their playdates.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.209
Hey, hey, look how clean
it is in here.
I see it.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.243
Stick with me, kid.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.612
That's right. We cleaned up.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.846
You got us.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.316
Oh, here we go.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.883
Good luck.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.186
See you on the other side.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.696
KATE:
Oh, my God!

19:23.730 --> 19:26.299
EMME: What happened?
TEDDY: Somebody help!

19:26.333 --> 19:29.536
That is the sweet
sound of victory.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.904
(whistles)

19:31.938 --> 19:34.674
(imitates small explosion)

19:34.707 --> 19:36.876
(imitates bigger explosion)

19:39.412 --> 19:40.880
I did all the laundry.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.283
I took out all the trash.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.686
I broke a plate and didn't have
to do anything after that.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.424
And what I'm hearing
is you surrender.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.825
Pretty much.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.594
Say it.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.732
ALL:
We surrender.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.369
All right,
then the strike is over.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.471
We do our work.
You do your work.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.773
Everybody gets along.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.575
You win.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.943
We're not very happy.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.914
And that's how we know
we're doing a good job.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.324
Okay.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.526
After I take out the kids'
trash, I'll make their beds.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.762
Okay. And, uh,

20:29.796 --> 20:30.997
I'll pick up their toys

20:31.030 --> 20:32.599
and start vacuuming their rooms.
Okay.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.770
Hey.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.573
What the hell happened?

20:43.543 --> 20:44.711
Call your dad!

20:44.744 --> 20:46.746
I'm on it.
