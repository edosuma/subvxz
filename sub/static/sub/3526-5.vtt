01:45.605 --> 01:47.596
Rusty!

01:49.042 --> 01:52.876
Rusty!

01:52.912 --> 01:54.880
You don't answer,
someone calls you?

01:54.914 --> 01:57.144
Look at this
shit now.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.570
What do you got
for me, Counselor?

02:17.604 --> 02:19.595
The Brioni.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.588
Hear ye, hear ye.

02:37.624 --> 02:40.684
The Honorable Dennis Holzer of the
Eastern District of New York presiding.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.628
Court is now in session.
Be seated.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.359
Come to order.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.857
The defendant's request for temporary
release from federal custody

02:49.903 --> 02:53.930
to attend his daughter's
wedding is ludicrous.

02:53.973 --> 02:57.568
Mr. Sacrimoni is a known member
of organized crime

02:57.610 --> 03:00.238
at the helm of a vast
criminal conspiracy.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.646
l notice you're wearing
a wedding ring, Ms. Vaughn.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.650
Was your father
at your wedding?

03:04.684 --> 03:08.142
My father wasn't awaiting trial
on 47 RlCO predicates,

03:08.188 --> 03:10.247
including murder.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.658
Mr. Sacrimoni...

03:14.694 --> 03:17.185
your application
is granted.

03:17.230 --> 03:21.360
- Oh, thank God!
- On the following conditions. Quiet!

03:23.303 --> 03:26.101
You'll be released
for a total of six hours

03:26.139 --> 03:28.869
to attend the church service
and party thereafter.

03:28.908 --> 03:32.036
During the entirety
of the six hours,

03:32.078 --> 03:35.275
you will be escorted
by U.S. marshals.

03:35.315 --> 03:39.308
The cost of their presence,
transportation

03:39.352 --> 03:42.810
and the cost of metal detection
screening equipment

03:42.855 --> 03:46.086
is to be borne by you
at your own expense.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.616
You will consume
no alcohol

03:48.661 --> 03:53.064
nor other
intoxicating substances.

03:53.099 --> 03:56.535
Do you understand
and agree to these conditions?

03:56.569 --> 03:59.402
l do, Your Honor,
and thank you.

04:01.674 --> 04:02.902
Mrs. Soprano, good morning.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.604
- l'm Perry... Annunziata.
- Come in.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.749
Beautiful house.

04:12.785 --> 04:15.720
You are Gina Annunziata's
cousin, right?

04:15.755 --> 04:19.247
Muscles Marinara,
the ltalian strongman.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.261
l'm just glad you got somebody
capable of protecting you,

04:22.295 --> 04:25.662
- driving for you.
- Well, that's why l got him here.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.325
She worries,
my wife.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.530
- Yeah, well...
- He's in good hands, Mrs. Soprano.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.630
First runner-up,
Mr. Teenage Bloomfield.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.868
Your first day
back at work.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.001
Gosh, l feel
like a mommy.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.069
Hey. Come on.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.104
See you later.

04:49.822 --> 04:53.019
So what do you do?
Free weights, machines?

04:53.059 --> 04:56.586
Little bit of both. Depends what muscles
l'm trying to hit, you know?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.529
Oh.

04:59.999 --> 05:03.457
Yeah, l gotta get
back to the gym.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.971
You want, l'll make you
a program.

05:08.841 --> 05:12.538
There was a time
when l could bench over 300 lbs.

05:12.578 --> 05:15.672
With a major head cold
one time, l did it.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.853
You cough with weights
like that over your head,

05:20.887 --> 05:22.855
you crush your neck.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.880
l guess l don't
gotta tell you.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.825
Ho! You don't signal?

05:36.869 --> 05:37.995
Hey, fuck you!

05:38.037 --> 05:39.766
Whoa whoa whoa.

05:52.385 --> 05:55.354
Sorry.

05:55.388 --> 05:59.449
My mom says l should count 10,
but l never remember.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.629
Well, here l am.

06:12.672 --> 06:16.438
- Back.
- Yep.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.444
So let me ask you
right off,

06:18.478 --> 06:20.469
is there any chance
of a mercy fuck?

06:21.614 --> 06:23.605
Just kidding.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.315
- How are you feeling?
- You went to medical school.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.879
A gut shot is everything they ever
told you it was.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.448
And emotionally?

06:33.493 --> 06:36.223
l'm happy to be alive.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.856
Have you spoken
to your uncle since it happened?

06:38.898 --> 06:42.834
No. And won't.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.600
Finally get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.201
Had a hospital bed
in the house

06:51.244 --> 06:54.179
- last month and a half or so.
- ls sleeping difficult?

06:55.281 --> 06:57.306
- Tylenol helps.
- What about dreams,

06:57.350 --> 06:59.784
night terrors,
anything like that?

07:02.722 --> 07:05.282
Gloom is your business,
and business is good.

07:05.324 --> 07:09.226
You were shot, Anthony,
by a member of your family.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.628
l know.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.632
And unless l know
absolutely nothing

07:13.666 --> 07:15.998
about what l'm doing,

07:16.035 --> 07:18.663
l think you and l'll
have a lot to talk about.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.438
Are you familiar
with the term

07:24.477 --> 07:26.570
''post-traumatic stress''?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.307
l get it, okay?

07:28.347 --> 07:31.407
My uncle tried to kill me,
for the second time.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.250
Three strikes
and l'm out, right?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.813
Who knows? Maybe l
am suppressing things.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.825
But for right now,
l feel like each day is a gift.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.123
l told my sister.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.992
And that's how
it's gonna stay.

07:44.030 --> 07:47.431
Fair enough.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.368
ls there something
else you'd like to talk about then?

07:50.403 --> 07:54.032
Let's pick up where
we left off before this all happened.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.472
AJ.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.533
Believe it or not,

07:57.577 --> 08:00.637
things have gotten
worse with that kid.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.707
Flunked out of college.
He waited till l was in a coma.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.311
Didn't you leave Seton Hall after
a semester and a half?

08:08.354 --> 08:09.981
All right, fine,

08:10.022 --> 08:13.389
but why can't he copy
some of the good things about me?

08:13.426 --> 08:16.156
- Does he have a job?
- Blockbuster.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.163
First stop
on the shitbird express.

08:18.197 --> 08:21.792
ln some ways, this horrible shooting
may provide an opportunity

08:21.834 --> 08:24.826
for him to learn
from your mistakes.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.771
My mistakes--

08:26.806 --> 08:28.933
l got caught up
in domestic violence.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.409
You think it can't happen
to you, but it does.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.412
But l was referring
to the bigger picture:

08:33.446 --> 08:35.311
The ready access
to guns,

08:35.347 --> 08:38.010
the use of violence
to solve disputes

08:38.049 --> 08:40.644
because of the nature
of your work, your uncle's work.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.951
l told you l didn't want
to talk about my uncle.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.686
Fine, but for now
is it safe to say

08:46.726 --> 08:49.456
that there are worse
ways to earn money

08:49.495 --> 08:52.589
than by stocking shelves
at Blockbuster?

08:54.767 --> 08:56.894
Yeah, there are.

09:01.407 --> 09:04.342
- Come on, you in or what?
- Don't fuck with my concentration.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.245
l've warned you before.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.944
What is it?
800 more?

09:11.984 --> 09:14.544
Fuck it. Fold.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.613
Cards.

09:20.826 --> 09:23.693
Oh! There's the skip.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.027
Back with a vengeance.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.090
- You look great.
- How are you?

09:28.134 --> 09:30.534
Welcome home, T.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.038
- Come here, you malingerer you.
- Easy easy easy.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.771
- Great to have you back, T.
- Fucking great to be back.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.905
- Sit, Ton', l'll clear your spot.
- We got you your bialy

09:41.948 --> 09:44.473
as soon as we heard
you were coming in today.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.280
Nuke that joe
so it's hot.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.292
Oh, fuck.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.799
The onions--
l can't.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.767
Oh, scoop out
that bialy.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.827
- l got it.
- Sorry.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.338
l got it, Ton',
no problem.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.808
There you go. l'll get your coffee,
and you're all set.

10:12.845 --> 10:17.805
So the municipal
swimming pool--

10:17.850 --> 10:20.114
- the bid start on that yet?
- l got a lunch tomorrow.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.120
That guy Deutsch
from the planning commission.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.679
Antibiotics.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.784
l had that with the spleen.
Staves off the infection.

10:27.827 --> 10:31.024
Spleen, my ass.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.260
Beat this.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.167
- Oof, Madonn'.
- Fuck that.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.194
Check out this bad boy.

10:40.706 --> 10:44.540
l had the plastic surgeon,
Taschlin, do the outside sutures.

10:47.179 --> 10:50.808
Plepler, the head trauma man,
he did the inside work.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.512
He dealt with the sepsis.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.645
l was the first guy
at the hospital to have the VAC.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.986
lt's an open-incision
situation.

10:58.024 --> 11:01.687
lt's a better way to heal.
Less pulling on the outer dermis layers.

11:01.727 --> 11:05.026
The thing is with all the Ativan
and the Dilaudid l was taking,

11:05.064 --> 11:08.522
intestinal blockage
was a constant fucking problem.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.967
- So in the long run--
- There's your coffee, Ton'.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.198
- Yeah.
- Ton', with your medicine,

11:13.239 --> 11:14.467
you want l set my watch
so you don't gotta worry?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.338
Nurse Betty over here.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.741
When my mom had the lupus,
God rest her soul,

11:18.778 --> 11:20.746
'round the clock care
l gave that woman.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.078
Medicine, food, lifted her
in and out of the tub.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.948
- The man's trying to eat.
- l'm just saying.

11:25.985 --> 11:30.285
Another life l might have gone
into health care. l actually enjoyed it.

11:30.322 --> 11:32.790
How about a bandage over your mouth
then? We're trying to play.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.692
You can lift a grown
woman out of a tub?

11:35.728 --> 11:37.559
lsn't it ironic?

11:37.596 --> 11:39.564
Fucking hospital stay
like mine,

11:39.598 --> 11:42.624
you lose goddamn
muscle mass, not fat.

11:42.668 --> 11:45.569
Fucking believe it?

11:45.604 --> 11:48.767
You'd think at least something good
would have come out of the situation.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.402
- You in, Ton'?
- Sure, why not?

11:51.444 --> 11:54.572
- He's in.
- Same game, five-card calls?

11:54.613 --> 11:59.107
Same game. Why? You wanna change
games now 'cause l won three pots?

11:59.151 --> 12:01.415
Keep the cards
down, Sil.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.684
The government's
own neuropsychologist

12:03.723 --> 12:05.850
clearly finds
evidence of dementia.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.018
Evidence consistent
with dementia.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.824
Nonetheless, l'm going to
recommend he be sent

12:10.863 --> 12:14.560
to a prison psychiatric
facility for further evaluation.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.398
He'll only be warehoused
in a public facility.

12:17.436 --> 12:19.927
Now, Your Honor, we ask
that Mr. Soprano be sent

12:19.972 --> 12:23.066
- to a private locked facility.
- Why not a resort in Antigua?

12:23.109 --> 12:26.567
You want his mental state
improved so you can put him on trial?

12:26.612 --> 12:28.671
Just let him go to a place where
he can get better.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.682
You got Uncle Angelo
at table 19?

12:37.723 --> 12:39.520
What?
He's with Connie and them.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.856
And when he sees Aunt Lorraine
and the Haitian boyfriend

12:41.894 --> 12:43.953
sitting next to them...

12:43.996 --> 12:46.487
- l thought you were on top of this.
- There's 400 people, John.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.500
l've had other things
on my mind.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.025
And l'm idling
away the hours?

12:52.538 --> 12:54.972
Who's not talking
to who?

12:55.007 --> 12:56.975
This one
can't see that one.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.442
lt's okay, honey.
Take it easy.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.104
You were the one
who wanted a big wedding.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.979
Catherine, your sister has enough
to deal with without the commentary.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.643
l'm sorry l blew
my stack, okay?

13:07.787 --> 13:10.722
We are gonna get through
this as a family-- dignified, proud--

13:10.756 --> 13:12.917
despite all the persecution
and roadblocks.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.257
And when l say family,
that includes you, too, Eric.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.991
- Thank you, John.
- Thank you who?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.123
Thank you, Dad.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.794
You...

13:25.971 --> 13:29.532
l want you to relax.
Make sure you eat.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.408
- You too.
- Me? No, thank you.

13:32.444 --> 13:35.436
l am eight lbs. away from my goal,
and l am fitting in that dress

13:35.481 --> 13:38.075
- if it kills me.
- Jesus, can we ever talk about anything

13:38.117 --> 13:41.109
in this family
besides food?

13:44.156 --> 13:47.319
- Three sixes.
- Boat, 10s over Jacks.

13:47.359 --> 13:50.226
- Vito, you again.
- All right, that's it for me.

13:50.262 --> 13:53.390
- Banker's hours.
- Pace myself, doctor said.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.525
You'd be surprised
how much energy the body expends

13:55.568 --> 13:58.162
- during the healing process.
- Penne Arabiatta,

13:58.204 --> 14:00.365
go get the car
cooled down, will you?

14:00.406 --> 14:04.035
- Penne Arabiatta.
- Yeah, that's what l call him.

14:04.076 --> 14:06.306
Red pepper flakes
up his ass.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.210
He's a fucking hothead.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.618
Ton',
Phil Leotardo's here.

14:16.121 --> 14:18.612
All right,
bring him in.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.390
There he is.
Back in business.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.864
- How's the labonza?
- Oh, it's good.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.530
You guys letting him win?

14:32.571 --> 14:35.631
Listen, l need
to bend your ear.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.073
Can't it wait?
l was just about to go.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.579
l just sat in traffic
all the way from Brooklyn.

14:41.614 --> 14:46.142
l was up by John.
He sends his regards.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.643
He'd like you to do
him a favor, though.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.986
What now?

14:52.024 --> 14:54.584
Our friend there,
the Mayor of Munchkinland,

14:54.627 --> 14:56.561
John wants him gone.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.688
Jesus. Rusty?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.461
John's worried he might
find another puppet like Little Carmine,

15:01.500 --> 15:03.468
try to run the family
through him.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.663
So why me hit him?

15:05.704 --> 15:08.366
You guys got more buttons
than my grandmother's fucking corsets.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.240
John wants things to point away
from the family.

15:13.879 --> 15:17.610
You know what?
Tell him no.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.618
Time and again
l've done his bidding.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.052
lt's time to set
some limits.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.352
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.187
Be well.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.978
l thought
l heard the door.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.450
How was the first day?

15:52.484 --> 15:55.009
lt was good.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.682
- Tired, though.
- You wanna take a nap?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.629
Smells good.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.995
Downy fresh.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.168
God, this feels great.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.235
lt does.

16:40.432 --> 16:43.060
Chris.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.093
Let 'em in.

16:47.706 --> 16:52.166
Ho! Where are the rest
of the 40 thieves?

16:52.211 --> 16:54.202
You got it?

16:55.347 --> 16:58.578
Good week.
1 20 credit card numbers

16:58.617 --> 17:00.710
plus the three-digit
security codes,

17:00.753 --> 17:03.517
- but l won't charge you no extra.
- Excellent.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.022
- Don't leave home without it.
- No, we'll use them.

17:06.058 --> 17:09.391
No, credit cards.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.419
The commercial.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.465
So Tony's out of hospital.
Please give him our wishes.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.527
We brought him
some dates.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.332
Also, Chris, you know
how we can purchase

17:22.374 --> 17:25.104
a couple of TEC-9 semi-automatics,
extended magazines?

17:25.144 --> 17:29.843
Hold on. TEC-9s?
What the fuck for?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.543
lt's a family problem.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.710
My former brother-in-law,
actually.

17:33.752 --> 17:37.882
All right,
fucking take it easy.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.255
What did the guy say?

17:40.292 --> 17:43.455
Our friend from the other place,
he talked to the guy?

17:43.495 --> 17:45.463
What's his name,
the local guy.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.036
Yeah yeah, l know.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.474
Hold on.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.140
Yep, l see it.
Thank you, Ro.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.325
Mr. Sacrimoni, l'm Deputy Feathem,
U.S. Marshal Service.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.462
This is my partner
Deputy Mayweather.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.598
We're here to escort you
to the wedding today.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.801
Gentlemen.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.921
Though ordered by the court,
your release is at our discretion.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.949
So based on your behavior or any other
mitigating factors,

18:47.993 --> 18:50.154
we can elect
to bring you back early.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.163
- Patent leather?
- lt's a tuxedo.

18:52.197 --> 18:55.462
Have you read an issue
of ''GQ'' in the past three or four years?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.974
Allegra Sacrimoni
getting married.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.943
Were we not just
at her christening?

19:05.978 --> 19:09.141
1980-- 50-lb.
bundle of joy.

19:09.181 --> 19:12.548
She'll be a beautiful
bride, Tony.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.575
All brides are beautiful.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.319
Wait till this one gets married.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.259
How much are we giving?
So l can write it down.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.694
You keep tabs on gifts?
How sentimental.

19:24.730 --> 19:28.029
- That's how it's done, Meadow.
- So we can know if they stiff us

19:28.066 --> 19:30.159
- when your big day comes.
- Exactly.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.760
All this pressure.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.498
l know you'd like to think
it's me pressuring you,

19:33.539 --> 19:35.803
but the reality is it's your father
keeps this going.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.173
Please, like you aren't desperate
to have a grandchild.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.974
Any thoughts on when you and Finn
are tying the knot?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.140
This discussion is over.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.844
Look, sweetie.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.044
lt's just...

19:50.088 --> 19:52.056
what l been through,

19:52.090 --> 19:54.081
it changes the way
you think.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.890
Holding my grandkids--

19:56.929 --> 19:58.897
your kids--

19:58.931 --> 20:01.092
on my lap...

20:02.901 --> 20:05.131
all of a sudden,
it's very important to me.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.978
Could l have
your name, sir?

20:41.273 --> 20:43.264
Hey, is that the father?
Jesus Christ.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.572
Yeah.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.715
Cell phones,
cameras, keys.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.550
All metal objects
must be placed in a tray.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.421
- Sir, what is this?
- Nitroglycerin. What do you think?

20:59.458 --> 21:02.188
Cologne. Smell it,
you don't believe me.

21:02.227 --> 21:03.319
Proceed.

21:09.868 --> 21:12.837
You'd think bin Laden
was getting married in there.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.738
You realize they made John pay
for all this heightened security

21:15.774 --> 21:17.765
- out of his own pocket?
- Are you kidding?

21:17.809 --> 21:19.777
- The government did that?
- Mm-hmm.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.107
- You okay?
- Yeah,

21:23.148 --> 21:25.309
- it's hot.
- Almost there.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.325
All metal objects
in the tray, sir.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.264
Jesus Christ!

21:43.302 --> 21:45.395
Arms outstretched,
please.

21:56.915 --> 21:59.440
All right, you'll need to step out
and remove your shoes, sir.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.851
- Oh, come on!
- lt's all right.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.423
Tony, Tony!

22:15.467 --> 22:17.560
- Daddy!
- AJ, get him a chair!

22:31.583 --> 22:33.210
l should have worn loafers.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.219
lt ain't your fault, T.
lt's all this bullshit.

22:35.253 --> 22:38.518
- lt's a steam bath.
- l'll get a damp paper towel.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.354
Sorry.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.429
Here, Ton',
some water.

22:44.463 --> 22:48.160
He just got out of the hospital.
Are the shoes really necessary?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.600
- Sorry, Miss.
- Let me do it, don't bend.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.033
All right.

23:00.078 --> 23:03.878
l, Eric, take you,
Allegra, to be my wife.

23:03.915 --> 23:07.681
Allegra. Ain't that
a cold medicine?

23:07.719 --> 23:10.279
lt means happiness
in ltalian.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.382
What the fuck's that got to do
with cold medicine?

23:13.425 --> 23:16.861
...forsaking all others
so long as you both shall live.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.863
ln sickness
and in health,

23:18.897 --> 23:22.560
forsaking all others
as long as we both shall live.

23:22.601 --> 23:25.570
Allegra, repeat
these words.

23:25.604 --> 23:29.370
l, Allegra, take you,
Eric, to be my husband...

23:29.408 --> 23:32.036
l, Allegra, take you,
Eric, to be my husband...

23:32.077 --> 23:35.103
To have and to hold
in good times and bad,

23:35.147 --> 23:37.115
for richer
and for poorer...

23:37.149 --> 23:40.243
To have and to hold
in good times and bad,

23:40.285 --> 23:42.617
for richer
and for poorer...

23:42.654 --> 23:44.485
ln sickness
and in health,

23:44.523 --> 23:45.956
forsaking all others,

23:45.991 --> 23:48.323
so long as we both
shall live.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.351
ln sickness
and in health,

23:50.395 --> 23:54.832
forsaking all others,
so long as we both shall live.

24:15.287 --> 24:19.223
Would you believe this place,
the money they've spent?

24:19.257 --> 24:22.920
lt's either this or give it to the feds
in the asset seizure.

24:22.961 --> 24:27.125
Check this out. They got a whole
seafood station over there.

24:27.165 --> 24:31.226
- You're not hungry, sweetie?
- l don't eat fish. The toxins.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.973
Pinot grig
for the missus.

24:36.007 --> 24:39.170
- Rum and coke for the kids.
- Thank you.

24:39.211 --> 24:42.180
And a club soda
for the convalescent.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.614
Thank you, sir.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.413
Salut.

24:47.452 --> 24:50.216
Hey, there he is.

24:52.457 --> 24:54.391
Meadow,
you look stunning.

24:54.426 --> 24:57.452
- Thank you.
- And look at this young dentist,

24:57.496 --> 25:00.693
all handsome
in his Calvin Klein.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.825
Some beautiful grandkids
these two will make, huh?

25:04.169 --> 25:07.138
So, Ton',
you got a sec?

25:07.172 --> 25:08.935
Yeah.

25:14.112 --> 25:16.979
Listen, Ton',
l don't mean to talk business,

25:17.015 --> 25:18.983
but l had
to tell you.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.350
l met with that guy Deutsch,
the one from the planning commission.

25:22.387 --> 25:25.117
Not only is he in charge of approving
bids for all city contracts,

25:25.156 --> 25:27.249
he's also a degenerate
horse player.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.055
So he'll play ball?

25:29.094 --> 25:30.686
He's fucking Joe DiMaggio.

25:30.729 --> 25:34.358
And this is from Weehawken,
the strip mall.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.929
Enjoy your day.

25:45.310 --> 25:48.609
Oh, here he is.
Father of the bride.

25:48.647 --> 25:51.707
- Good to see you.
- John, she looks so beautiful.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.378
- lt was so moving.
- Thank you, honey. l appreciate it.

25:54.419 --> 25:55.943
All this.

25:55.987 --> 25:59.753
Hey, googootz, you wanna
be an event planner,

25:59.791 --> 26:01.122
you learn from this.

26:01.159 --> 26:04.287
An event planner?
Where do you get this shit?

26:04.329 --> 26:07.560
''Stuff'' would do nicely, AJ.
We're at a wedding.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.938
Good to see you,
my friend.

26:13.972 --> 26:16.133
You too, John.

26:16.174 --> 26:17.573
lt's been a long time.

26:17.609 --> 26:19.509
Obviously, l couldn't come
visit you in the hospital.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.876
When l heard what happened,
l was devastated.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.575
That's life, huh?

26:24.616 --> 26:27.107
So seriously,
what's the damages here?

26:27.152 --> 26:29.245
What am l in for
with Meadow?

26:29.287 --> 26:32.688
Not counting
the honeymoon, 425.

26:32.724 --> 26:35.318
So adjusting
for inflation,

26:35.360 --> 26:37.123
l'm looking
at half a rock.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.687
What's it all for, though, Tony, huh?
What we put in, the grind.

26:39.731 --> 26:41.756
lsn't that
for things like this?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.290
Yeah.

26:44.803 --> 26:46.794
So l heard Phil
came to see you.

26:49.507 --> 26:53.102
Let's go say hello
to your dad.

27:02.087 --> 27:04.578
So how you doing here?
You having a good time?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.921
- Which one are you?
- My friend Tony, Pop.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.655
Hey, l'm gonna say
a few things,

27:10.695 --> 27:12.754
and these pricks
are watching,

27:12.797 --> 27:15.595
so l'm gonna make like
l'm talking to your dad and them.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.331
Hey, Aunt... Farris.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.929
Hello.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.872
What you asked me to do
with the little guy,

27:25.910 --> 27:27.878
l can't do it.

27:27.912 --> 27:29.880
This fucking prick,

27:29.914 --> 27:32.109
he's disruptive.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.880
He doesn't have the balls
to step up himself.

27:34.919 --> 27:39.015
- What did he say?
- So just keep him away from Phil.

27:39.057 --> 27:42.584
He's a cancer.
l can't let it spread.

27:44.729 --> 27:48.324
Well, you're gonna
have to use one of your own doctors.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.527
Oh, l'd love to.
Believe me.

27:50.568 --> 27:53.230
But my position is
not completely solidified.

27:53.271 --> 27:55.466
You should call
Dr. Cuomo.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.806
- We're just talking here, Aunt Louise.
- Don't eat that pepper!

27:58.843 --> 28:00.868
- When Carmine died...
- What?

28:00.912 --> 28:04.643
...Rusty could have been boss.
He should have been.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.914
But he didn't want
the responsibility.

28:07.952 --> 28:11.080
Like l advised you.

28:12.891 --> 28:15.291
Say no more.

28:15.326 --> 28:17.419
lt's too fucking
late now anyway.

28:17.462 --> 28:19.430
l need your help, Tony.

28:19.464 --> 28:22.365
Some of these guys,
my captains,

28:22.400 --> 28:25.267
they find out l'm behind
the move against him?

28:25.303 --> 28:29.399
Make things worse. l can't take
that risk while l'm in jail.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.433
Stay out of trouble.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.843
So l'm supposed
to put myself at risk,

28:34.879 --> 28:37.177
share the same fucking
jail cell as you?

28:37.215 --> 28:39.376
- What did he say?
- l don't know.

28:39.417 --> 28:40.884
Forget it, John.

28:40.919 --> 28:44.184
lt's Allegra's
wedding, Tony.

28:44.222 --> 28:47.089
The way things are,

28:47.125 --> 28:49.355
l don't know if l'll be
around for Catherine's.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.454
l know you're going through a rough
time right now, all right?

28:52.497 --> 28:55.489
Then do me
this favor, Tony.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.135
Okay, l'll take care
of it.

29:08.346 --> 29:10.610
l won't forget it.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.479
All right.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.927
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for,

29:22.961 --> 29:24.826
for the first time
anywhere,

29:24.863 --> 29:28.264
let's give a huge hand
and a lot of love to...

29:30.435 --> 29:34.132
Mr. and Mrs.
Eric DiBenedetto!

29:37.375 --> 29:40.469
Ladies and gentlemen,
for their first dance as man and wife,

29:40.512 --> 29:42.810
Allegra and Eric
have chosen

29:42.847 --> 29:44.974
the lovely...

30:12.477 --> 30:15.708
Please join our bride and groom
on the dance floor.

30:36.634 --> 30:39.194
How you doing
over there?

30:39.237 --> 30:41.228
l'm okay.

30:45.410 --> 30:49.210
- Wanna dance?
- Really?

30:49.247 --> 30:51.681
lt's a slow one.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.746
Thank you, gentlemen.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.736
Okay, Corrado.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.378
- Taking any medication?
- Coumadin.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.490
Not bad, Corrado.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.497
- You got a tree outside.
- Don't bullshit me.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.095
Doctor will be in later
to do a thorough admission.

32:19.938 --> 32:24.375
So, l'll check in
with you at the end of the week.

32:24.409 --> 32:26.673
You're gonna get the help
you need here, Corrado,

32:26.711 --> 32:29.009
so you can aid
in your own defense.

32:29.047 --> 32:30.810
l didn't shoot anybody!

32:30.848 --> 32:33.976
Corrado, look, l don't
know you that well, but you have to--

32:34.018 --> 32:36.953
He's my nephew, God damn it.
Why would l shoot him? Why?

32:38.222 --> 32:40.053
The gun was
on the fritz.

32:41.526 --> 32:44.290
l wanna go home.

32:44.329 --> 32:46.297
- Corrado, stop it.
- l wanna go home!

32:46.331 --> 32:48.492
Stop.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.468
You know
that's not possible.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.494
lf l did it, the fucking gun
malfunctioned.

32:54.539 --> 32:58.100
lt was old, okay?
l should have cleaned it.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.543
Try to get some sleep.

33:01.579 --> 33:03.672
You'll feel better
in the morning.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.481
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time

33:11.522 --> 33:14.423
our lovely bride will dance
with her father.

34:13.016 --> 34:15.246
This is how it works,
l'm thinking.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.846
We bring somebody over
from Naples.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.719
What?

34:19.757 --> 34:22.089
Completely insulate ourselves.
They do Rusty,

34:22.126 --> 34:25.152
they're back on a plane
over the Atlantic two hours later.

34:26.864 --> 34:29.525
l don't know, T.
You ask me, farming it out

34:29.567 --> 34:32.195
is a pussy-ass
maneuver.

34:33.603 --> 34:36.164
Excuse me?

34:36.206 --> 34:39.699
Ton', the rollatine!

34:39.744 --> 34:41.678
Hold on.

34:41.712 --> 34:44.373
lf we're gonna do it,
we should do it ourselves,

34:44.415 --> 34:46.679
maintain control.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.514
Better yet, tell New York
to fucking handle it already.

34:49.554 --> 34:52.114
John just asked me
specifically.

34:52.156 --> 34:53.918
So it's like
the movie then.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.858
- What movie?
- One.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.554
That you can't
refuse a man's request

34:57.595 --> 35:00.587
- on his daughter's wedding day.
- No, it's the other way around.

35:00.631 --> 35:03.725
That l should be asking
him for something he can't refuse.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.293
- So did you?
- No.

35:06.337 --> 35:10.330
- You should ask not to do this.
- l already fucking agreed.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.410
Look, we wanna keep
him placated, right?

35:13.444 --> 35:15.412
l mean, the shit with Phil
and his little brother

35:15.446 --> 35:17.414
and the perpetual hard-on
he's still got with us.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.575
l don't think
it's a good idea.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.710
Well, l didn't ask you
what you fucking think.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.187
- Come on.
- You're going already?

35:32.230 --> 35:34.198
He's always like this
at weddings.

35:34.232 --> 35:38.396
You make me sound rude. Crab cakes.
l told you l don't feel good.

35:38.436 --> 35:40.563
They don't keep
in this heat.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.573
Vito, let's go.

35:42.607 --> 35:44.802
Francesca, come on.

35:46.944 --> 35:49.071
Good night.

36:20.411 --> 36:23.505
John, gonna have to
wrap this up.

36:26.951 --> 36:29.920
Six hours you said.
l got till quarter till 11 :00.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.979
That includes
transportation, sir.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.390
- You fucking kidding me?
- l tried, John. They won't budge.

36:35.426 --> 36:37.326
Can he have
some cake at least?

36:37.361 --> 36:39.386
You can pack some
to take with you, if you'd like.

36:39.430 --> 36:41.159
Heartless pricks.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.726
Out front in 20.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.252
Here they come!

37:12.330 --> 37:14.321
Thank you, Daddy.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.834
- l love you, baby.
- l love you, too.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.632
Mom!

37:24.675 --> 37:27.769
You came this close to almost
making your goal.

37:27.812 --> 37:30.781
- Have a great time, sweetheart.
- l'll call you when we land.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.442
Bye, Grandpa.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.187
Say hi to Don Ho.

37:43.961 --> 37:47.260
l love you.

37:47.298 --> 37:48.993
What the fuck?!

37:52.670 --> 37:54.797
- Let's go, John.
- What? Wait a second.

37:54.839 --> 37:58.400
- Let's go.
- Stand back, please.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.171
Can you let my daughter
leave at least?

38:00.211 --> 38:03.305
- Daddy, what's happening?
- l will not ask you again.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.812
- You motherfucker.
- Oh my God.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.116
- What are you doing?
- Get your hands off him.

38:10.154 --> 38:11.746
Jesus Christ! ls that
fucking necessary?

38:11.789 --> 38:14.781
Stand back. Now!

38:17.662 --> 38:19.653
John.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.633
Wait.

38:32.476 --> 38:35.502
Mom! Oh God.
Oh God!

38:36.514 --> 38:38.141
- ls she all right?
- Ginny!

38:38.182 --> 38:40.207
Oh my God!

38:40.251 --> 38:42.481
Put her head back.
Let me check her airway.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.312
Go.

38:46.357 --> 38:49.326
l'll tell you one thing, and l'm
not ashamed to say it,

38:49.360 --> 38:52.352
my estimation
of John Sacrimoni as a man

38:52.396 --> 38:54.830
just fucking plummeted.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.833
Give him a break,
will ya?

38:56.867 --> 38:58.835
lt's an emotional day.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.394
To cry like a woman?
lt's a fucking disgrace.

39:01.439 --> 39:04.306
His fucking coach
turned into a pumpkin.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.572
Well, even Cinderella
didn't cry.

39:06.610 --> 39:09.078
When it comes to daughters,
all bets are off.

39:09.113 --> 39:11.240
l've seen tougher guys
than John cry at weddings.

39:11.282 --> 39:13.409
Well, let me
ask you this--

39:13.451 --> 39:16.545
lf they can make him cry
and if he's that weak,

39:16.587 --> 39:18.680
what the fuck else
can they make him do?

39:18.723 --> 39:20.054
l gotta agree
with Phil, Ton'.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.683
Oh, you do, do you?

39:21.726 --> 39:25.355
Terrible out there, huh?
Poor guy.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.796
He's an emotional man.
He loves his daughter.

39:29.433 --> 39:32.027
l want to give you
a home, take care of you.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.764
Love you.

39:33.804 --> 39:35.362
Oh, Steve.

39:35.406 --> 39:38.466
You don't know me.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.500
l still love...

39:42.813 --> 39:44.747
Where are you going?

39:44.782 --> 39:47.376
- l gotta make some collections.
- Now?

39:49.019 --> 39:51.886
- l thought you were sick.
- Go to bed.

39:51.922 --> 39:54.755
l'll see you later.

39:54.792 --> 39:57.386
Maybe too much.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.521
Don't think
l want any less.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.053
Do you love me?

40:01.098 --> 40:04.556
l think l do.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.884
We have been
very lucky, Tony.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.444
The house, the kids,

40:24.488 --> 40:27.082
what we just went through
at the hospital.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.790
You make
your own luck in life.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.592
l'll stop by tomorrow.

41:32.723 --> 41:34.816
What do you got
for me, Nicky?

41:34.859 --> 41:37.384
Let met get my wallet.

41:42.933 --> 41:44.958
Fucking skeeve,
this shit.

42:01.919 --> 42:04.786
What's a guy gotta do
to buy you a drink?

42:04.822 --> 42:07.120
You just did it.

42:11.262 --> 42:12.957
Vito?

42:12.997 --> 42:14.862
What the fuck?

42:14.899 --> 42:16.833
- Sal, hey.
- Fuck you doing?

42:16.867 --> 42:20.667
Nothing. l was here.
lt's a joke.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.104
- You're a fucking fag?
- Watch it, buddy.

42:23.140 --> 42:25.165
You fucking watch it,
cupcake.

42:25.209 --> 42:28.201
- Guys, come on. lt's okay.
- You think so?

42:28.245 --> 42:30.440
Sal, please,
it's a fucking joke.

42:30.481 --> 42:33.848
Right, sure.
Say hi to your wife.

42:33.884 --> 42:37.183
l'm serious.
l'm-- Sal, please.

42:38.589 --> 42:42.116
Don't say nothing, Sal!

42:42.159 --> 42:45.219
Fuck those jerks.
What do you care what they think?

42:46.530 --> 42:49.590
What? Leave me
the fuck alone.

43:03.447 --> 43:06.075
- Honey.
- Go back to sleep.

43:06.116 --> 43:08.141
l'm gonna
take a shower.

44:20.391 --> 44:24.418
- Hello.
- ls Sil there?

44:24.461 --> 44:26.554
Vito Spatafore.

44:30.768 --> 44:33.965
- Hello.
- What do you know? What do you say?

44:34.004 --> 44:35.801
What do l know?
What do l say?

44:35.839 --> 44:39.639
lt's three o-fucking clock.
ls Tony all right?

44:39.677 --> 44:42.202
That's why l'm calling you.
Checking in.

44:42.246 --> 44:44.714
Last l saw,
he was having dessert.

44:44.748 --> 44:47.182
All right, then.

44:47.217 --> 44:49.742
- Everything else okay?
- Yeah.

44:49.787 --> 44:52.381
Call me on my cell,
you need anything.

45:14.111 --> 45:16.079
The point is they made me
take off my shoes,

45:16.113 --> 45:19.082
and l nearly passed out in front
of everybody trying to bend over.

45:19.116 --> 45:21.949
- Well, that's not good.
- People misinterpret.

45:21.985 --> 45:24.453
They think you're weak,
they see an opportunity.

45:24.488 --> 45:26.046
They're my friends,

45:26.090 --> 45:29.082
a lot of them, but they're also
fucking jackals.

45:29.126 --> 45:30.787
- Alpha male.
- lt's subtle,

45:30.828 --> 45:33.353
but since l been back,
l been noticing certain looks

45:33.397 --> 45:36.855
and people questioning my judgment
where they never did before.

45:36.900 --> 45:40.768
Sure, cat's away,
bad habits set in.

45:43.774 --> 45:45.742
ln a perfect world

45:45.776 --> 45:47.539
l just relax,

45:47.578 --> 45:50.809
let them think whatever
the fuck they want.

45:50.848 --> 45:53.078
Act as if.

45:53.117 --> 45:56.814
As if you're not
feeling vulnerable.

45:56.854 --> 45:59.254
As if you're
the same old Anthony.

45:59.289 --> 46:01.814
Strong, ''l'm sure,''
decisive.

46:01.859 --> 46:05.955
People see only what
you allow them to see.

46:05.996 --> 46:09.932
Yeah, l been thinking
the same thing.

46:12.803 --> 46:14.771
Thanks for the advice.

46:14.805 --> 46:17.603
Glad to be of service.

46:17.641 --> 46:19.768
Bring that.
Come on, come on, come on!

46:19.810 --> 46:21.801
Where you going?

46:48.372 --> 46:51.603
Ho, get the skip
a chair.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.440
l don't want a chair.
l'm fine.

46:54.478 --> 46:57.174
Ton', how you doing?

46:57.214 --> 47:00.809
- What are you weighing these days?
- Don't ask. 265.

47:04.354 --> 47:06.345
Let's go.

47:21.605 --> 47:24.403
Hey, what's up, Ton'?

47:24.441 --> 47:27.171
- Skip.
- Hey, boss.

47:32.549 --> 47:34.517
You talk to Vito?

47:34.551 --> 47:37.816
Huh? l called him two times.
He never called me back.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.755
You try the house?

47:39.790 --> 47:41.849
'Cause he called me
just the other night.

47:43.560 --> 47:46.552
Hungry, T.? You want, l'll have
Bissell fix you a sandwich.

47:46.597 --> 47:48.827
No no, l'm good.
l'm good.

48:46.990 --> 48:48.958
What's your
fucking problem?

48:48.992 --> 48:51.222
Huh?

48:51.261 --> 48:53.627
What the fuck
is your problem?

48:53.664 --> 48:55.928
Slamming the goddamn
refrigerator door.

48:55.966 --> 48:58.799
- What? No.
- Are you gonna argue with me now?

48:58.835 --> 49:00.803
l didn't even
open the refrigerator.

49:00.837 --> 49:02.566
The Coke was out
on the counter.

49:02.606 --> 49:06.770
So you are gonna
argue with me, huh, you fucking mutt?

49:08.045 --> 49:10.411
Look, Tony,
l don't wanna--

49:10.447 --> 49:12.813
You don't wanna what?
You don't wanna what?

49:14.051 --> 49:16.383
This fucking guy, huh?

49:18.021 --> 49:20.114
Fucking Philadelphia
lawyer.

49:23.226 --> 49:24.955
Jesus!

49:24.995 --> 49:28.453
- Don't do it!
- No, don't do it!

49:28.498 --> 49:30.864
My arm!

49:41.044 --> 49:43.308
How's that, huh?

49:43.347 --> 49:45.645
You got
anything else to say?

Get up.
