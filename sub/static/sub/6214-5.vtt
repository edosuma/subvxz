00:01.637 --> 00:03.127
"And although
he's played his last gig,

00:03.305 --> 00:05.398
Screamin' Hank Walters
will be joining Hendrix, Elvis,

00:05.574 --> 00:06.598
and maybe even Tupac... "

00:06.775 --> 00:08.868
"For an all-star jam session in heaven. "

00:09.044 --> 00:10.943
Did you read this obituary
before I turned it in?

00:11.113 --> 00:13.013
No, no, I'm reading the one
you wrote last week.

00:13.182 --> 00:14.877
Oh, right.

00:15.050 --> 00:17.746
Well, it is an obituary.
It's not like they're gonna complain.

00:17.920 --> 00:18.944
Hey, it's no big deal.

00:19.121 --> 00:21.180
I reuse the same photos
over and over again.

00:21.357 --> 00:23.086
Of course,
I had to stop when people realized

00:23.258 --> 00:25.283
Queen Latifah
never fought Lennox Lewis.

00:25.461 --> 00:28.225
You know, when I got this job,
I thought I'd be doing more interviews.

00:28.397 --> 00:31.423
But I've covered
more dead rockers than vomit.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.295
Can I just give you a little advice?

00:34.303 --> 00:35.395
Go find your own stories.

00:35.571 --> 00:37.402
You write something decent,
Annie will run it.

00:37.573 --> 00:40.303
You write something indecent
and she'll put it on the cover.

00:40.476 --> 00:42.603
If I wanna impress Annie,
that's what I'll have to do.

00:42.778 --> 00:46.236
You're right. I'm gonna tell Annie
I have written my last obituary.

00:46.682 --> 00:48.513
Sabrina,
get down to Boston General.

00:48.684 --> 00:50.515
Keith Richards is having chest pains.

00:50.686 --> 00:52.278
Can't I wait
until he goes to the morgue?

00:52.454 --> 00:54.922
I have my own parking spot there.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.768 --> 01:43.033
What you're looking at now
is the Morganwear fall line.

01:43.205 --> 01:46.697
I like these, but actually,
we're buying for spring right now.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.342
Oh, not a problem.

01:50.279 --> 01:52.770
And now,
you have scarves to match.

01:53.716 --> 01:55.513
Whoa, cute headband.

01:55.684 --> 01:57.049
That's a skirt.

01:57.219 --> 01:59.153
And I'm guessing
a great way to meet guys.

01:59.321 --> 02:03.951
I'm telling you, these designs
will be flying off the rack. Ha, ha.

02:05.227 --> 02:07.422
Flying off the rack.

02:07.596 --> 02:08.789
Oh, oh! That's our cue.

02:10.032 --> 02:13.126
Oh, look, I love this blouse.

02:13.302 --> 02:15.031
Roxie, don't you love this blouse?

02:15.204 --> 02:18.571
- Love it? I'd like to be buried in it.
- That's right, Roxie.

02:18.741 --> 02:21.107
Because Morganwear
works for every occasion.

02:21.276 --> 02:23.574
Well, your friends
seem to really like your stuff.

02:25.981 --> 02:27.505
Morgan,
are we almost through here?

02:27.683 --> 02:29.548
I really should be out
trying to dig up a story.

02:29.718 --> 02:31.845
Actually, I really like your designs.

02:32.020 --> 02:34.113
Let me finish this call,
and I'll place an order.

02:35.023 --> 02:38.220
I sold something.
I sold something, ha, ha.

02:38.393 --> 02:40.020
I deserve a little treat.

02:40.195 --> 02:43.096
What do you think,
uh, Lexus or Mercedes?

02:43.265 --> 02:45.756
Uh, how about chipping in
for groceries once in a while?

02:48.070 --> 02:49.537
That's Babette Storm.

02:49.705 --> 02:52.367
Oh, yeah.
She's in town shooting a film.

02:52.541 --> 02:54.941
Wow. She looks even better
in person.

02:55.110 --> 02:58.045
"Bo," "tox. "
- Get out.

02:58.213 --> 03:00.204
She's pushing 30,
she's gotta do something.

03:00.382 --> 03:01.406
Hey, that's a great story:

03:01.583 --> 03:03.448
What an actress has to do
to stay in the game.

03:03.619 --> 03:05.712
Now, how can I prove
that she's using Botox?

03:05.888 --> 03:07.685
Stick a safety pin in her forehead.

03:08.991 --> 03:10.117
Oh, my God, did you see that?

03:10.292 --> 03:11.350
She just shoplifted.

03:11.527 --> 03:12.755
That's really sad.

03:12.928 --> 03:14.589
Yeah, it is.

03:14.763 --> 03:17.493
She stole from the clearance rack.

03:26.141 --> 03:28.371
If I buy a box of Thin Mints,
will you go away?

03:28.544 --> 03:31.377
What if I had a story about someone
who was actually alive?

03:31.547 --> 03:32.605
What have you got?

03:32.781 --> 03:34.772
Well, I saw Babette Storm
last night at a boutique,

03:34.950 --> 03:37.578
and let's just say she's no stranger
to the five-finger discount.

03:37.753 --> 03:39.311
That means shoplifting.

03:39.488 --> 03:41.922
Got any proof?
That means you're a real reporter.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.523
Well, I saw it with my own two eyes.

03:43.692 --> 03:47.059
Hey, five fingers, two eyes.
Maybe I can use that in my article.

03:47.229 --> 03:49.197
Look, I have no doubt
this woman's a thief, okay?

03:49.364 --> 03:51.525
There is no other explanation
for her Oscar.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.100
But find a story you can back up.

03:54.269 --> 03:56.567
Well, I know for a fact
she's had Botox injections.

03:58.073 --> 03:59.768
I think.

04:02.544 --> 04:04.171
Come on, cheer up.

04:04.346 --> 04:05.813
I can't help it. I'm bummed.

04:05.981 --> 04:07.846
I try to show my boss
that I know what I'm doing

04:08.016 --> 04:09.506
and I end up
looking like an amateur.

04:09.685 --> 04:11.915
Well, why don't you do
what I do when I feeling down?

04:12.087 --> 04:13.315
Let strangers rub my belly?

04:13.488 --> 04:14.682
Huh.

04:15.791 --> 04:17.257
Order the champagne.

04:17.426 --> 04:18.450
Monique just called.

04:18.627 --> 04:20.959
She wants to double
her initial order of Morganwear.

04:21.129 --> 04:22.619
Congratulations.

04:22.798 --> 04:24.698
At least one of our careers
is taking off.

04:24.867 --> 04:26.266
Oh, Sabrina, I don't have time

04:26.435 --> 04:28.630
for the Annie-is-evil pep talk
right now.

04:28.804 --> 04:30.704
I have 50 outfits to deliver.

04:32.741 --> 04:34.038
Oh, okay.

04:34.710 --> 04:37.178
Annie is evil,
you're great, hang in there.

04:37.346 --> 04:39.644
- Oh, I forgot the best part.
- I'm thin and beautiful?

04:39.815 --> 04:41.146
Oh, we're back to me now.

04:41.316 --> 04:43.580
Babette Storm
ordered one of my dresses

04:43.752 --> 04:46.619
to wear to the press conference
for her new film.

04:46.788 --> 04:48.483
You might wanna sew in a LoJack.

04:48.657 --> 04:52.184
She's picking it up at Monique's
on Thursday at 1:00.

04:52.361 --> 04:56.559
Now, because of this stupid cast,
I am gonna need help with the sewing.

04:56.732 --> 04:59.292
Wait, she's going back
to that boutique?

04:59.468 --> 05:01.493
Maybe I have another shot
at that story.

05:01.670 --> 05:02.898
I just need proof.

05:03.338 --> 05:04.669
Hey, guys. What's going on?

05:04.840 --> 05:07.035
Hey, Roxie.
Do you know how to sew?

05:07.209 --> 05:09.939
Sew? A needle pulling thread?

05:10.379 --> 05:11.403
Never mind.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.741
How about you, Sabrina?
Do you wanna work for me?

05:13.916 --> 05:16.885
Not even if the job was testing pie.

05:16.886 --> 05:18.717
All I need you to do
is come to this boutique

05:18.888 --> 05:20.879
so that I can prove
that Babette is a shoplifter.

05:21.057 --> 05:23.048
You know, bring your camera,
just skulk around.

05:23.226 --> 05:24.284
Now, wait a minute.

05:24.461 --> 05:27.487
They tend to keep an eye on a brother
skulking in a ritzy women's boutique.

05:27.664 --> 05:29.529
Fine, then give me your camera.

05:29.699 --> 05:32.634
I broke mine trying to kill a spider.

05:32.802 --> 05:34.963
Maybe you do deserve a break.

05:35.138 --> 05:37.163
Actually, you remind me
of myself when I came here.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.900
Young, naive, desperate to succeed.

05:40.343 --> 05:42.072
- I'm not desperate to succeed.
Oh?

05:42.245 --> 05:44.941
That is so not me. Ha, ha.

05:45.115 --> 05:46.912
Please, help me, James. Please?

05:47.083 --> 05:48.983
- Okay, I'll help you.
- Thank you.

05:49.152 --> 05:51.245
You know, uh,
I've done surveillance before.

05:51.421 --> 05:52.547
Dangerous stuff.

05:52.722 --> 05:55.782
Sean Penn whacked me right here.
P. Diddy slapped me right here.

05:55.959 --> 05:57.426
Celine Dion got me right here.

05:57.594 --> 05:58.959
She hit you?

05:59.129 --> 06:02.155
<i>No, it's the Titanic theme,
it chokes me up.</i>

06:02.999 --> 06:04.990
Welcome to Morganwear.

06:05.168 --> 06:06.430
Congratulations.

06:06.603 --> 06:09.037
You girls have the thrill
of working for a vibrant,

06:09.205 --> 06:13.266
cutting-edge company
focused on generation now.

06:13.443 --> 06:16.037
Now, don't be threatened
working for someone

06:16.212 --> 06:18.373
so much younger
and more beautiful than you.

06:18.548 --> 06:20.209
Oh, please.

06:20.383 --> 06:24.114
When I was her age, I had a rack
you could bounce a wing nut off of.

06:24.821 --> 06:26.482
Where did you pick up
the bridge game?

06:26.656 --> 06:28.021
This is my new work force.

06:28.191 --> 06:29.215
They're day laborers.

06:29.392 --> 06:31.883
I found them hanging out
in front of the fabric store.

06:32.062 --> 06:34.860
We were waiting
for a bus to Atlantic City.

06:35.632 --> 06:37.930
You know, Morgan,
this looks like unfair labor practice.

06:38.101 --> 06:40.126
You can't hold people
against their will.

06:40.303 --> 06:42.430
No, not all of them.

06:43.039 --> 06:45.064
I started with eight.

06:48.745 --> 06:50.770
- Oh, there she is.
- Really?

06:50.947 --> 06:52.175
She don't look like a thief.

06:52.348 --> 06:53.940
She also doesn't look
like Harriet Tubman,

06:54.117 --> 06:56.847
but that didn't stop her from playing
the part in that one-woman show.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.612
Okay, pretend like
you don't know me.

06:58.788 --> 07:01.518
Right. We all got Annie's memo
about that.

07:05.028 --> 07:08.054
Oh, this is kind of nice.

07:08.231 --> 07:11.064
Ahem, would this look good on me?

07:11.968 --> 07:13.560
Uh, are you asking me?

07:13.737 --> 07:16.297
Yeah. Be honest.

07:16.473 --> 07:19.965
Well, it's a little "get out of the trailer,
there's a twister coming. "

07:20.143 --> 07:21.906
Oh, you're right.

07:22.078 --> 07:26.105
Um, but, you know,
this blouse would look great on you,

07:26.282 --> 07:28.876
and at this price, it's a steal.

07:29.052 --> 07:30.610
I mean, a bargain.

07:30.787 --> 07:33.722
That's gorgeous.
You have very good taste.

07:33.890 --> 07:34.948
Really? Thanks.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.218
Would you mind telling my boss that?
And my roommates?

07:37.393 --> 07:39.588
And, well, actually,
can I get it in writing?

07:39.763 --> 07:41.822
I'm Babette.
My friends call me Babs.

07:42.232 --> 07:43.824
I'm Sabrina.
My friends call me Sabs.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.365
Oh.
- They don't really.

07:45.535 --> 07:49.335
Oh. You know, it's so rare that I meet
someone down-to-earth

07:49.506 --> 07:51.303
and honest like you.

07:51.474 --> 07:53.738
Would you mind
helping me pick out a few things?

07:53.910 --> 07:56.174
Really? Sure.

07:56.346 --> 07:58.871
And you have to get that blouse.

07:59.048 --> 08:00.413
My treat.

08:00.583 --> 08:04.110
Okay, then I'll just try
on this one little blouse.

08:04.487 --> 08:06.614
And this and this.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.382
Ooh, I love this.

08:08.558 --> 08:10.389
Because, actually,
y'all about the same size.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.619
So, uh, could you try this on for me?

08:12.796 --> 08:14.991
You sure your mother
wants this for her birthday?

08:15.165 --> 08:16.757
Oh, yeah.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.827
Psst, psst, psst.

08:20.003 --> 08:21.197
May I help you?

08:21.371 --> 08:23.134
Uh, do you have
any changing rooms?

08:23.306 --> 08:25.069
You are standing right by them.

08:25.241 --> 08:26.401
Ah.

08:26.576 --> 08:29.067
- Some of these women are so dumb.
- Mm.

08:29.579 --> 08:31.706
- Okay. I'll try on the teddy for you.
- Thank you.

08:31.881 --> 08:33.610
James, pay attention.

08:33.783 --> 08:35.443
I'm working, I'm working.

08:35.618 --> 08:38.313
I love buying clothes,
but I hate trying them on. Don't you?

08:38.488 --> 08:39.682
It takes so long.

08:41.424 --> 08:42.448
Tell me about it.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.855
First, you gotta try stuff on.

08:45.662 --> 08:47.755
And take them off.

08:48.698 --> 08:50.222
And then if you need another size,

08:50.400 --> 08:53.164
you gotta go back
and get another one.

08:56.973 --> 08:59.203
Now, it's small and overpriced.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.866
Oh, I look terrible in this one.

09:02.045 --> 09:03.603
I doubt. You'd look great in anything.

09:03.780 --> 09:05.907
No, seriously,
this one will make me like a cow.

09:06.416 --> 09:07.747
It can't be that bad. Let me try.

09:12.922 --> 09:14.355
Ooh! Uh, I see what you mean.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.020
What?

09:17.193 --> 09:18.922
I said, "Ew, you're right. "

09:22.065 --> 09:23.623
- Any luck?
- Ugh.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.530
No, everything was either too clingy,
too floofy or two paychecks.

09:26.703 --> 09:29.399
- How about you?
- No, struck out.

09:29.572 --> 09:31.199
Really, huh?

09:32.909 --> 09:35.537
So, listen,
do you wanna grab a bite?

09:36.546 --> 09:38.912
- You wanna go to lunch with me?
- Sure.

09:39.082 --> 09:41.346
I just... I feel like I have
this connection with you.

09:42.018 --> 09:43.747
And it will be fun.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.478
Well, I guess I could go to lunch.

09:45.655 --> 09:48.215
I already packed mine, but bologna
keeps for a couple of days.

09:48.391 --> 09:50.450
Ha, ha. Afterwards,
maybe we'll swing by my spa.

09:50.627 --> 09:52.390
We'll make a day of it. Come on.

09:53.763 --> 09:54.957
Look, Babette,

09:55.965 --> 09:57.159
I have to be honest with you.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.198
<i>I'm a reporter for Scorch magazine.</i>

09:59.969 --> 10:01.596
That guy over there,
he's a photographer.

10:01.771 --> 10:04.103
We're working on an article
about you being a shoplifter.

10:06.242 --> 10:07.470
At least I am.

10:07.644 --> 10:08.975
What are you talking about?

10:09.679 --> 10:12.113
I saw you take something
from here the other day.

10:12.282 --> 10:13.749
I don't want you to ruin your career

10:13.917 --> 10:15.942
over some blouse
that will look stupid in two weeks,

10:16.119 --> 10:18.314
so put the stuff back
and I'll forget about the article.

10:18.488 --> 10:19.921
You guys in the media are all alike.

10:20.089 --> 10:23.422
You try to tear us down to make
your own lives seem less pathetic.

10:23.593 --> 10:25.083
No, I'm not gonna write the article.

10:25.261 --> 10:27.695
What makes you think I'm pathetic,
the bologna? It's not like I fry it.

10:27.864 --> 10:29.491
Miss Storm,
is this woman disturbing you?

10:29.666 --> 10:30.826
Ahh, I'll be fine.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.935
Just get the dress I ordered
so I can go.

10:34.304 --> 10:36.534
- Do not bother the famous people.
But I...

10:36.706 --> 10:38.503
I think you'd better leave.
- James?

10:38.675 --> 10:41.041
Dieter, and I don't know this woman.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.905
Well, at least let me get my stuff.

10:44.013 --> 10:47.244
I'm really sorry, Miss Storm.
Please...

10:47.417 --> 10:48.941
...consider this a gift from us.

10:49.118 --> 10:50.415
Thank you.

10:50.586 --> 10:52.281
She was gonna take it anyway.

10:53.222 --> 10:55.918
I'm telling you, she's got stuff
in that bag. She's ripping you off.

10:56.326 --> 10:58.851
If she had
merchandise, bells would be ringing

10:59.028 --> 11:00.757
and Gary Coleman
would be searching her bags.

11:01.164 --> 11:02.188
Come on.

11:02.365 --> 11:04.060
And please don't tell
anybody what happened.

11:04.233 --> 11:05.996
I really want to keep this very quiet.

11:08.738 --> 11:10.433
I didn't. I swear.

11:10.606 --> 11:11.732
James, a little help?

11:11.908 --> 11:14.638
Okay, but they're gonna do this
for free down at the precinct.

11:21.751 --> 11:23.480
Good morning, Cole.

11:23.653 --> 11:25.587
Hey, how you doing, Sabrina?

11:25.755 --> 11:26.779
How's it going?

11:26.956 --> 11:28.753
So you heard.

11:28.925 --> 11:31.894
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.698
Okay, I'm innocent.

11:36.868 --> 11:37.994
Just so you know,

11:38.169 --> 11:41.297
I just got off the phone with our
publisher about your little escapade.

11:41.472 --> 11:44.635
- He screamed for five minutes.
- He's pretty upset, huh?

11:45.043 --> 11:47.238
Oh, he was getting
a deep-tissue massage.

11:47.412 --> 11:49.380
But for some reason,
he won't let me fire you.

11:49.547 --> 11:51.208
It's like you have some spell on him.

11:51.382 --> 11:52.940
I don't. Oh, wait, hang on.

11:53.117 --> 11:54.482
No, I really don't.

11:54.652 --> 11:56.711
You are very lucky
you are not in jail right now.

11:56.888 --> 11:59.789
Yeah, because I'd really hate
to miss fall colors.

11:59.958 --> 12:01.425
Thanks for getting me off the hook.

12:01.593 --> 12:04.118
- Yeah, well, you're on borrowed time.
- Well, I was set up.

12:04.295 --> 12:05.489
She pretended to be my friend.

12:05.663 --> 12:08.757
She's a much better actor
in real life than she is on the screen.

12:08.933 --> 12:11.231
Can I just give you some advice?

12:12.237 --> 12:13.727
Journalism rule number one:

12:13.905 --> 12:15.395
Never get too close to your subject.

12:15.573 --> 12:16.835
Rule number two:

12:17.008 --> 12:18.635
Never shoplift on company time.

12:19.310 --> 12:21.141
You actually think
I stole something?

12:21.312 --> 12:23.712
Sabrina, it's cool. Everyone knows
what Jonathan pays you.

12:23.881 --> 12:26.372
- You do what you gotta do.
- Okay, first, I didn't do.

12:26.551 --> 12:28.451
And second,
everyone knows what I make?

12:28.620 --> 12:29.644
Yeah.

12:29.821 --> 12:32.949
But hang in there,
Congress is gonna raise it next year.

12:33.791 --> 12:36.692
James, you were there with me.
You know I didn't steal anything, right?

12:36.861 --> 12:38.954
Hey, hey, relax.
Just ignore them, okay?

12:39.130 --> 12:40.961
You and I both know
what happened.

12:41.132 --> 12:44.192
- Besides, the camera don't lie.
- Thanks.

12:44.369 --> 12:45.393
Uh-huh.

12:45.570 --> 12:47.470
This came out
way better than I thought.

12:48.306 --> 12:49.705
James.

12:49.874 --> 12:51.967
Hey, I've never been
a bad girl before.

12:52.143 --> 12:54.236
I look kind of hot.

12:55.380 --> 12:57.007
I don't hear sewing machines.

12:57.181 --> 12:59.046
Come on, ladies, back to work.

12:59.217 --> 13:01.208
But we were watching our stories.

13:01.386 --> 13:03.251
Yeah, yeah.

13:03.421 --> 13:05.480
<i>You'll be seeing
The Guiding Light soon enough.</i>

13:05.657 --> 13:07.682
Come on, let's go.

13:08.226 --> 13:09.693
What are you doing home?

13:09.861 --> 13:11.328
Well, I had to leave work.

13:11.496 --> 13:13.589
I wanted a peaceful lunch
without people leering at me

13:13.765 --> 13:15.392
like I was gonna steal their pickle.

13:15.566 --> 13:17.261
Sabrina, Sabrina.

13:17.435 --> 13:20.165
Do you understand
the consequences of your actions?

13:21.873 --> 13:24.205
What if Babette Storm found out
that we were roommates

13:24.375 --> 13:26.900
and decided not to wear the dress
to her press conference?

13:27.078 --> 13:29.774
Oh, I'm sorry, Morgan.
I was only thinking of myself.

13:29.947 --> 13:32.780
Thank God you have me
as a role model.

13:34.619 --> 13:36.450
Hey, there's my favorite cause.

13:36.621 --> 13:37.713
Oh, Roxie. Thank you.

13:37.889 --> 13:40.119
I can't believe you had a T-shirt
made up just for me.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.417
I had it since I was kid.

13:41.592 --> 13:43.355
It used to say, "Willy,"
but I scraped it off.

13:43.528 --> 13:46.691
- That's how much I believe in you.
- It could be worse, I suppose.

13:46.864 --> 13:48.855
It could say
"Spay and Neuter your Sabrina. "

13:49.300 --> 13:50.562
Come on, Sabrina.

13:50.735 --> 13:52.635
Get even
with this cheap tramp actress.

13:52.804 --> 13:55.466
Call up the news stations,
post the truth on her website.

13:55.640 --> 13:56.664
Maybe you're right.

13:56.841 --> 13:59.173
Maybe she has some other secret
I could dredge up.

14:00.411 --> 14:01.708
Here she is. Look at this.

14:01.879 --> 14:04.473
Four years ago,
she was arrested for shoplifting.

14:04.649 --> 14:06.708
Whoa, how do you steal
a tanning bed?

14:06.884 --> 14:09.114
- Oh, first, she stole a truck.
- Hmm?

14:09.287 --> 14:10.948
The charges were dropped.

14:11.122 --> 14:13.955
But I bet I could use all this
to force a confession from Babette.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.116
Where is she now?

14:19.864 --> 14:21.729
Look,
it's her trailer from the movie set.

14:21.899 --> 14:23.264
And there she is.

14:23.768 --> 14:24.962
What's she doing?

14:25.136 --> 14:28.264
What do you think?
She's stealing cable.

14:29.073 --> 14:30.097
Eh?

14:33.778 --> 14:35.769
Just leave my lunch and go.

14:35.947 --> 14:38.108
No, I'm here to talk.

14:39.150 --> 14:41.812
Oh, it's you.

14:41.986 --> 14:43.453
<i>What are we doing,
The Movie?</i>

14:43.621 --> 14:46.112
- Are you ready to apologize?
- Apologize?

14:46.290 --> 14:48.281
I was trying to keep you
from getting into trouble.

14:48.459 --> 14:50.859
Now, everybody thinks
I'm a thief and a liar and an A-cup.

14:51.028 --> 14:52.586
I was stealing that bra for my sister.

14:52.764 --> 14:54.129
You think because you're a big star

14:54.298 --> 14:56.095
that laws don't apply to you,
Carla Bernstein?

14:56.267 --> 14:58.201
Well, you know,
you could have gotten me fired.

14:58.369 --> 14:59.631
You could have ruined my career.

14:59.804 --> 15:01.669
And I am fully capable
of doing that on my own.

15:03.207 --> 15:07.109
Look, I... I didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.137
Would it help if I called your boss
and set everything straight?

15:12.250 --> 15:13.547
- That would be great.
- Okay.

15:13.718 --> 15:16.653
And could you tell her
that you'll let me do a feature on you?

15:16.821 --> 15:19.119
And, you know,
you never did buy me that blouse.

15:19.290 --> 15:21.281
Let's start with your boss.

15:21.459 --> 15:24.155
Dial the number and I'll get on.

15:24.328 --> 15:25.795
I'll just be in my trailer.

15:25.963 --> 15:27.453
Thank you.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.098
Hi, Annie? Sabrina.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.737
Spellman.

15:33.905 --> 15:34.997
The new girl?

15:35.173 --> 15:37.038
Look, Babette Storm
has something to say to you.

15:37.208 --> 15:38.675
Hold on a sec.

15:39.277 --> 15:40.835
Babette?

15:41.179 --> 15:42.646
Babs?

15:43.214 --> 15:44.545
Elly May?

15:44.715 --> 15:45.739
Hey, ma'am.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.317
We just got a call that someone
stole Miss Storm's cell phone.

15:48.486 --> 15:50.249
Can I see that?

15:51.956 --> 15:53.287
Annie?

15:53.458 --> 15:55.483
Yeah, she'll have to get back to you.

15:59.163 --> 16:01.290
You are an embarrassment
to this magazine.

16:01.466 --> 16:03.400
In my defense,
you thought that before this.

16:03.568 --> 16:04.762
She set me up.

16:04.936 --> 16:06.130
Why would I steal a cell phone?

16:06.304 --> 16:07.328
I have my own phone

16:07.505 --> 16:09.632
with way more minutes
than anybody could possibly need.

16:09.807 --> 16:12.139
Mostly nighttime and weekend
minutes, but what I want...

16:12.310 --> 16:13.937
Okay, could you...? Please.

16:14.111 --> 16:15.669
What I'm saying is I didn't do it.

16:15.847 --> 16:18.077
Jonathan has managed
to pull a few strings

16:18.249 --> 16:22.015
and Miss Storm has agreed not
to press charges as long you get help.

16:22.753 --> 16:24.220
Help?

16:27.992 --> 16:29.516
Help.

16:30.962 --> 16:32.088
You must be new here.

16:32.263 --> 16:33.355
Welcome to Klept-Anon.

16:33.531 --> 16:35.055
I'm Cliff.

16:36.934 --> 16:39.129
I fell off the wagon at Macy's
on the way here.

16:39.303 --> 16:41.430
Think of it
as 100-percent-off sale.

16:42.139 --> 16:45.040
Grab some coffee.
We're about to get started.

16:51.315 --> 16:54.307
Everyone, we have a new member
joining our group tonight.

16:54.485 --> 16:56.612
Uh, would you like
to introduce yourself?

16:57.989 --> 17:00.617
Hi. I'm Sabs.

17:00.791 --> 17:02.725
Jane Sabs.

17:02.894 --> 17:04.724
And I am definitely not
a kleptomaniac.

17:04.896 --> 17:07.228
Mm-hm.
- I'm not.

17:07.397 --> 17:09.161
Jane, we've all been in denial.

17:09.333 --> 17:12.301
But sooner or later,
you've got to confront your demons.

17:12.470 --> 17:14.199
Oh, I've confronted demons.

17:14.372 --> 17:16.738
Big hairy demons
like you've never dreamt of.

17:16.907 --> 17:19.502
But right now the demon I need
to confront is Babette Storm.

17:21.646 --> 17:22.943
You know Babette Storm?

17:23.848 --> 17:27.944
I love her.
I have been to all of her movies.

17:28.118 --> 17:29.677
All right, I snuck in, but...

17:30.121 --> 17:31.588
Well, she is a thief and a liar,

17:31.756 --> 17:33.417
and she was horrible
as a submarine captain

17:33.591 --> 17:35.252
<i>in that movie
Courage Under Water.</i>

17:35.426 --> 17:37.121
Yeah, well,
she's the one that belongs here.

17:37.295 --> 17:38.956
I'm gonna prove it.

17:41.198 --> 17:42.688
Oh, sorry.

17:42.867 --> 17:46.098
I have one just like it at home.
I swear.

17:48.306 --> 17:50.103
Hello, little Salem.

17:50.274 --> 17:54.176
Granny May got you
some very special kitty candy.

17:54.345 --> 17:56.313
Oh, thanks, sweetheart. Oops.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.708
Did you just speak?

17:57.882 --> 18:00.680
Uh, no, it's the dementia setting in.

18:00.851 --> 18:02.751
Oh, ha, thank God.

18:03.788 --> 18:05.483
Jeez, it's like a kiln in here.

18:05.656 --> 18:07.988
You're running a sweatshop.
These conditions are deplorable.

18:08.159 --> 18:09.626
Oh, please, it's good for them.

18:09.794 --> 18:11.557
It keeps them sharp.

18:11.729 --> 18:14.425
Oh, Jeanette, don't eat the thread.

18:14.599 --> 18:16.191
Workers have rights too, you know.

18:16.634 --> 18:18.625
Come on, girls,
you don't have to take this.

18:18.803 --> 18:19.929
Let's stage a walkout.

18:20.438 --> 18:22.303
Oh, nice try, rabble-rouser.

18:22.473 --> 18:23.838
They're not walking out on me.

18:24.008 --> 18:26.101
I've got their support hose.

18:26.711 --> 18:28.770
<i>So in sum, I'd say Never, Always</i>

18:28.946 --> 18:32.177
is a story of hope,
redemption and love.

18:32.350 --> 18:33.783
Plus, you get to see my buns.

18:34.418 --> 18:35.544
Excuse me, excuse me.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.348
- Press coming through.
- We're all press.

18:38.522 --> 18:40.422
Okay,
then the shortest to the tallest.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.326
You always seem to bring out
the best in your co-stars.

18:43.494 --> 18:45.655
- How do you do it?
- Acting is like life.

18:45.830 --> 18:48.492
I always try to give more than I take.

18:48.666 --> 18:49.690
Oh, give me a break.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.767
I've got a question,
are you a shoplifter?

18:52.436 --> 18:54.836
Anyway, heh,
I've played many different roles,

18:55.006 --> 18:57.702
and preparing for them
is always about the search for truth.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.137
Kind of how I live my life.

18:59.310 --> 19:02.973
- Ugh, anybody got a shovel?
- Could you sit down?

19:04.015 --> 19:05.778
Okay,
it's time for some straight answers.

19:05.950 --> 19:09.113
<i>Whisper, mumble, scream or shout
Let the honest truth come out</i>

19:09.286 --> 19:11.880
What was it like working with
the up-and-coming star, Billy Pape?

19:12.056 --> 19:14.524
Oh, a dear, dear person,

19:14.692 --> 19:19.322
aside from his limited acting skills
and unlimited body odor.

19:19.997 --> 19:23.057
Um, is it true that you stole several
garments from the Monique store?

19:23.768 --> 19:25.258
I cannot tell a lie.

19:25.436 --> 19:29.930
For some inexplicable reason,
yes, heh, heh. Yes, I did. Ha, ha.

19:30.107 --> 19:32.098
And on Thursday,
did you put clothes in my bag

19:32.276 --> 19:35.404
after I warned you that I was reporter
doing a story about your shoplifting?

19:36.113 --> 19:37.808
Uh, guilty. Ha, ha.

19:39.350 --> 19:40.442
That's all I got.

19:40.618 --> 19:42.279
What else can you tell us
about Miss Storm?

19:42.453 --> 19:45.616
Never give up an exclusive story.

19:45.790 --> 19:47.382
Rule number one
was never get too close...

19:47.558 --> 19:49.321
Okay,
so I haven't memorized all the rules.

19:53.931 --> 19:57.867
I said, "I never give up an exclusive
interview" and I ran right here.

19:58.269 --> 19:59.736
Yeah, we know.

19:59.904 --> 20:01.428
The press conference is webcast.

20:01.605 --> 20:02.902
Really?

20:03.074 --> 20:06.168
Want to see what you missed
by running here with your exclusive?

20:06.343 --> 20:08.641
Oh, my God. Billy Pape showed up?

20:08.813 --> 20:11.407
<i>The lead in the film
was originally Julia Roberts,</i>

20:11.582 --> 20:14.676
<i>but I gave her food poisoning, forcing
her to bow out at the last minute.</i>

20:15.686 --> 20:19.816
<i>I also cheat on my taxes,
ha, ha, and my husband.</i>

20:19.990 --> 20:21.184
<i>And I altered my father's will</i>

20:21.358 --> 20:23.952
<i>when I found out
he left all his money to charity.</i>

20:24.128 --> 20:28.189
You see how your shoplifting story
kind of pales compared to this?

20:28.365 --> 20:30.230
Nice going.

20:31.001 --> 20:33.299
Don't hate me
because I'm her favorite.

20:33.604 --> 20:35.071
What? You got another rule for me?

20:35.706 --> 20:37.173
Well, since you asked.

20:37.341 --> 20:38.774
Journalism rule number four:

20:38.943 --> 20:41.571
Never yell stop the presses
unless you're stuck in them.

20:42.446 --> 20:44.038
I guess I really blew it.

20:44.215 --> 20:47.048
Look, your instincts were right,
you broke a big story.

20:47.218 --> 20:49.618
You just broke it for 20 other writers.

20:51.021 --> 20:52.716
You're gonna do great.

20:52.890 --> 20:55.882
Hey, listen. I had a rough start too.

20:56.060 --> 20:58.528
It took Annie about a year
before she stopped picking on me.

20:58.696 --> 20:59.856
Well, what changed?

21:00.030 --> 21:01.895
You showed up.

21:02.066 --> 21:04.660
Finally, someone appreciates me.

21:07.838 --> 21:10.705
Now that all your workers walked out,
how are you gonna fill your orders?

21:10.875 --> 21:13.207
Oh, I found even cheaper labor.

21:19.350 --> 21:22.444
Wait until PETA hears about this.

21:23.305 --> 21:29.199
