were those little eye crispies.

Like the shoes

04:00.657 --> 04:01.992
that people are wearing

Well, uh..

09:42.790 --> 09:46.253
...we're having a dress

09:42.790 --> 09:46.253
rehearsal at dance class.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.506
And I needed something

09:46.294 --> 09:49.506
to rehearse dressing in.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.425
[car honking]

09:51.466 --> 09:53.843
Oh-oh. Gotta go.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.843
That's my ride.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.143
Bye, D.J.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.143
I'll always remember you.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.982
Goodbye, Michelle.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.943
Best of luck

10:08.024 --> 10:09.943
in everything you do.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.947
See you, Gibbler.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.286
Kids on the block..

10:19.327 --> 10:22.539
-Whoa, baby.

10:22.581 --> 10:27.043
- There's a car in the kitchen.

10:22.581 --> 10:27.043
- I told you so.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.214
Michelle, do you know

10:28.753 --> 10:31.214
how Joey's car got in here?

10:31.256 --> 10:32.799
Yes, I do.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.843
- How?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.843
- Through the window.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.223
Girls, I'm home.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.223
Listen, I--

10:48.022 --> 10:50.233
Have mercy.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.279
There's a..

10:56.448 --> 10:59.367
- There's..

10:56.448 --> 10:59.367
- There's a car in the kitchen.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.660
Thank you.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.787
How did a car get

11:00.701 --> 11:02.787
in the kitchen?

11:02.829 --> 11:05.081
- Through the window.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.084
- Everybody okay?

11:05.123 --> 11:08.084
- Yeah, we're all fine.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.752
(Danny)

11:08.126 --> 11:09.752
'Hello.'

11:09.794 --> 11:12.255
But I don't think

11:09.794 --> 11:12.255
dad is gonna be fine.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.883
Well, alright. We have to break

11:12.297 --> 11:15.883
this to him very gently, okay?

11:15.925 --> 11:19.179
- 'Hey, where is everybody?'

11:15.925 --> 11:19.179
- In your new garage.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.932
We'll be right back.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.932
Stall dad.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.936
Alright, come on, Michelle.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.936
Come with me.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.356
It'll be a lot harder for him

11:26.978 --> 11:29.356
to cry in front of you.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.155
Hi, guys.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.155
How's it going?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.574
Oh, fine.

11:39.616 --> 11:40.867
We've had a bang-up day.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.579
There's a car in the kitchen.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.582
[laughing]

11:47.624 --> 11:50.126
Michelle, you're so silly.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.546
She's not that silly.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.713
Um, there's, uh,

11:52.587 --> 11:54.713
actually something

11:54.755 --> 11:57.258
I-I would like to show you

11:54.755 --> 11:57.258
in the kitchen.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.969
Okay, I'm ready.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.969
Send him in.

12:00.011 --> 12:03.473
Oh, this is great.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.058
I love surprises.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.644
Let's see,

12:05.099 --> 12:07.644
it's not Father's day.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.479
No.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.272
Oh, I love this.

12:11.314 --> 12:15.235
This must be one of those

12:11.314 --> 12:15.235
bonus "I love dad" days.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.570
I don't know.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.289
Good face, dad.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.376
Is everybody alright?

12:28.331 --> 12:31.376
Where's Stephanie?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.920
We're all fine.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.920
Stephanie's at dance class.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.007
Look at this house.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.384
Look at this kitchen.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.844
Look at this mess.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.844
I just waxed the floor.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.391
Where is my best friend, Joey?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.102
Dad, let me get

12:46.433 --> 12:49.102
one more picture of you.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.730
This is a very serious matter.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.565
That's okay,

12:51.770 --> 12:53.565
you don't have to smile.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.778
[knock on door]

12:59.820 --> 13:02.741
- Who is it?

12:59.820 --> 13:02.741
- Stephanie Judith Tanner.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.244
Steph, what are

13:04.867 --> 13:06.244
you doing here?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.037
My carpool dropped me off.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.956
I came to say goodbye.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.250
Goodbye?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.710
Stephanie, come in here.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.091
- Where are you going?

13:16.963 --> 13:20.091
- I'm moving to Mexico.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.386
I'm going to start a new life

13:20.133 --> 13:23.386
as a Mexican hat dancer.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.806
Stephanie, you're not allowed

13:25.888 --> 13:27.806
to cross the street

13:27.848 --> 13:29.559
how can you cross the border?

13:31.185 --> 13:34.397
I have no choice.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.397
I'm a woman on the run.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.275
Why?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.152
Because..

13:39.193 --> 13:41.279
...I can never go home again.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.622
Steph, why can't

13:48.536 --> 13:50.622
you go home?

13:50.664 --> 13:53.333
I'm having a little problem.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.210
Actually, it's more

13:53.374 --> 13:56.210
like a super-giganto

13:56.252 --> 13:58.588
dinosaur-size problem.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.465
Steph, come over here.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.343
Sit down and tell me

14:00.507 --> 14:03.343
what happened.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.680
It's too terrible.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.680
I can't even say the words.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.932
Stephanie, honey,

14:06.721 --> 14:09.932
you can tell me anything.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.352
Okay.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.728
I dr..

14:16.063 --> 14:17.398
I dr..

14:19.734 --> 14:21.068
I dr..

14:22.487 --> 14:25.824
You dropped something?

14:22.487 --> 14:25.824
Did something break?

14:29.536 --> 14:33.414
- What did you break?

14:29.536 --> 14:33.414
- You name it, I broke it.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.125
(Jesse)

14:34.874 --> 14:36.125
'Hey, Becky, it's me.'

14:36.167 --> 14:37.836
It's Uncle Jesse,

14:36.167 --> 14:37.836
you gotta hide me.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.672
- Oh, but, Stephanie..

14:37.877 --> 14:40.672
- Just don't tell him I'm here.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.507
Please, please, please.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.218
- 'Becky.'

14:42.549 --> 14:45.218
- Uh, coming.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.348
I heard voices.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.348
Who were you talking to?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.684
Uh, nobody.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.437
I'm a talk-show host

14:52.726 --> 14:56.437
and I was practicing talking.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.856
You look beautiful.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.525
Way too beautiful

14:57.938 --> 15:00.525
for a business dinner.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.820
Oh, those are lovely roses.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.820
Are they for me?

15:03.862 --> 15:05.154
Maybe.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.909
Well, yeah, I was gonna

15:07.073 --> 15:09.909
come over and apologize

15:09.950 --> 15:14.247
for acting jealous

15:09.950 --> 15:14.247
about that McIntyre creep.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.541
Well, look at this.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.541
I'm doing it again.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.292
I'm sorry.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.292
Will you forgive me?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.878
Of course,

15:18.334 --> 15:19.878
I forgive you.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.839
This was very sweet.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.839
Well, thanks for coming by.

15:22.881 --> 15:27.761
I'll call you later and tell you

15:22.881 --> 15:27.761
all about my boring dinner. Bye.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.513
Whose suitcase is that?

15:30.555 --> 15:33.099
Well, it's-it's

15:30.555 --> 15:33.099
not what you think.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.810
Someone's in the closet, isn't

15:33.140 --> 15:35.810
there? Who's in the closet?

15:35.852 --> 15:39.188
- What closet?

15:35.852 --> 15:39.188
- It's McIntyre, isn't..

15:39.230 --> 15:40.732
McIntyre, come on out.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.860
I got your business dinner

15:40.774 --> 15:43.860
right here.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.446
Jess...J-Jesse..

15:51.910 --> 15:54.995
Just as I suspected.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.372
Nobody's in here.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.336
He he he.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.259
Steph, what are

16:05.924 --> 16:08.259
you doing here?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.804
Just hanging around.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.349
Come on down.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.349
Let's go.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.561
Steph has a super-giganto,

16:15.391 --> 16:18.561
dinosaur-size problem, Jess.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.521
Oh, she does, huh?

16:20.563 --> 16:21.856
Then why don't you

16:20.563 --> 16:21.856
sit down over here

16:21.898 --> 16:23.441
and tell Uncle Jesse about it?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.656
Okay.

16:29.697 --> 16:33.409
I sort of drove

16:29.697 --> 16:33.409
Joey's car..

16:33.451 --> 16:35.286
..into the kitchen.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.497
You're the one

16:35.328 --> 16:37.497
who drove Joey's..

16:37.538 --> 16:38.748
Steph, you can't even drive.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.583
You're telling me.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.171
No wonder you're

16:41.709 --> 16:45.171
moving to Mexico.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.507
Take it from a guy

16:45.212 --> 16:47.507
who's been in trouble a lot.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.050
Now, I know

16:47.548 --> 16:50.050
you're feeling scared

16:50.092 --> 16:51.302
and you feel like

16:50.092 --> 16:51.302
you gotta run.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.637
But, let me

16:51.344 --> 16:52.637
tell you something.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.054
The best way

16:52.679 --> 16:54.054
to solve this problem

16:54.096 --> 16:56.015
is to go home

16:54.096 --> 16:56.015
and face the music.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.061
Was dad really mad

16:58.225 --> 17:01.061
when he saw the kitchen?

17:01.103 --> 17:03.063
Well, you'll be able

17:01.103 --> 17:03.063
to see for yourself

17:03.105 --> 17:05.650
when D.J.'s pictures come

17:03.105 --> 17:05.650
back from the one-hour photo.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.904
Come on.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.904
Let's go.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.704
Hey, Dad, it's almost dinner.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.704
Do you want me to set the car?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.795
Sure, honey.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.795
But use the good hubcaps.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.966
[whistling]

17:30.008 --> 17:32.760
You're in big trouble, mister.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.015
Joey, are you okay?

17:34.178 --> 17:37.015
You had us worried sick.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.516
Danny, I'm fine.

17:38.558 --> 17:43.103
In that case,

17:38.558 --> 17:43.103
you're in big trouble, mister.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.647
Hey, look, I know

17:43.145 --> 17:44.647
I'm a little late.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.399
But you're not gonna

17:44.689 --> 17:46.399
believe what happened.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.150
I had this little

17:46.440 --> 17:48.150
nick in my car, right?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.903
You don't say.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.071
And I went to buy

17:49.944 --> 17:52.071
some touch-up paint

17:52.112 --> 17:54.448
and you'll never believe

17:52.112 --> 17:54.448
who I ran into.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.869
Speaking of running into things,

17:54.490 --> 17:57.869
come with me into the kitchen.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.371
Oh, are you upset because

17:57.911 --> 18:00.371
I took the last ice cube

18:00.413 --> 18:01.915
and didn't refill the tray?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.836
Something like that.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.923
Wait, Dad.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.923
Let me get in there first.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.592
Danny, look, I-I'll go to the

18:09.964 --> 18:12.592
store, I'll buy some more ice.

18:12.633 --> 18:16.012
Everything will be fine, okay?

18:12.633 --> 18:16.012
Don't worry about it.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.680
My car.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.642
Rosie.

18:21.684 --> 18:25.229
This is my punishment for

18:21.684 --> 18:25.229
not filling the ice cube tray?

18:26.981 --> 18:28.441
Are you saying

18:26.981 --> 18:28.441
you didn't know about this?

18:28.482 --> 18:30.317
If I did, don't you think

18:28.482 --> 18:30.317
I would have bought

18:30.359 --> 18:33.487
a bigger jar

18:30.359 --> 18:33.487
of touch-up paint?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.782
Danny, when I left,

18:33.529 --> 18:35.782
Stephanie was watching my car.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.408
What the heck happened?

18:37.450 --> 18:40.160
Well, here's someone who knows

18:37.450 --> 18:40.160
what the heck happened.

18:42.371 --> 18:46.125
I was taking a make-believe

18:42.371 --> 18:46.125
drive through the country..

18:46.166 --> 18:49.295
...and I wanted

18:46.166 --> 18:49.295
to play the radio.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.213
So, I turned the key..

18:51.255 --> 18:54.550
...and the next thing I knew,

18:51.255 --> 18:54.550
I was in the kitchen.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.095
I should've never left

18:54.592 --> 18:57.095
those keys in the ignition.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.640
It's not your fault, Joey.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.934
I had no business

19:00.681 --> 19:02.934
being in your new car.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.686
- It was perfect.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.686
- Well, almost.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.563
The radio didn't work.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.315
Now he tells me.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.655
Go ahead, Dad.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.655
Yell, scream, punish me.

19:15.696 --> 19:19.492
Or if you want,

19:15.696 --> 19:19.492
I'll just move to Mexico.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.579
Right now, I want you just to

19:21.410 --> 19:23.579
wait upstairs in your room

19:23.621 --> 19:25.790
until I can figure out

19:23.621 --> 19:25.790
what to do with you.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.249
Come on, Steph.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.085
Here, Deej,

19:27.291 --> 19:29.085
take your sister upstairs.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.962
Make sure she doesn't

19:29.127 --> 19:30.962
skip the country.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.966
My turn to drive the car.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.468
You know the rules, Michelle.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.346
Nobody gets to drive

19:37.510 --> 19:40.346

Be a big boy.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.356
Come on, Steph.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.356
You just made a mistake.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.232
But everything's

19:50.397 --> 19:52.232
gonna be alright.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.864
D.J., I'd like to talk

19:54.944 --> 19:57.864
to Stephanie alone, please.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.700
Sure, Dad.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.700
Hang in there, Steph.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.330
Go easy on her, Dad.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.330
She's just a kid.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.797
Stephanie, I am very

20:11.752 --> 20:14.797
disappointed in you.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.841
How could you do this?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.134
You could've been hurt.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.553
You could've hurt

20:18.176 --> 20:20.553
someone else.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.305
What you did is the stupidest

20:20.594 --> 20:23.305
thing you've ever done.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.224
I know.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.224
That's why I ran away.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.560
And you know better

20:25.265 --> 20:27.560
than that, too, don't you?

20:27.601 --> 20:31.438
I know. Everything I do

20:27.601 --> 20:31.438
is wrong. I hate myself.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.945
Steph, come out

20:35.151 --> 20:37.945
from under there.

20:37.987 --> 20:41.032
I don't deserve fresh air.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.743
How long do you intend

20:41.074 --> 20:43.743
to stay under that blanket?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.745
Till I get married.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.205
You know, it could be

20:45.786 --> 20:47.205
very difficult

20:47.246 --> 20:48.831
to meet somebody

20:47.246 --> 20:48.831
under there.

20:50.416 --> 20:54.003
I'll just stay in my room

20:50.416 --> 20:54.003
the rest of my life.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.505
Well, I don't

20:54.045 --> 20:56.505
know about that.

20:56.547 --> 21:00.176
But I do know that

20:56.547 --> 21:00.176
I'm gonna have to punish you.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.510
Big time.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.264
And I should

21:03.262 --> 21:05.264
never get any allowance

21:05.305 --> 21:07.058
or presents ever again.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.561
And you should send me

21:08.559 --> 21:10.561
away to carpenter school..

21:10.603 --> 21:12.354
...so I can build you

21:10.603 --> 21:12.354
a brand-new house

21:12.396 --> 21:15.066
that you can live in

21:12.396 --> 21:15.066
without me.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.526
And you'd never have to

21:15.108 --> 21:17.526
hug or kiss me again.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.160
Steph, there is nothing

21:22.448 --> 21:26.160
you could ever do

21:26.202 --> 21:28.871
that would make me stop

21:26.202 --> 21:28.871
hugging and kissing you.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.250
Nothing?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.834
Come here.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.546
Look.

21:37.588 --> 21:41.341
You have to know, that

21:37.588 --> 21:41.341
no matter what you do wrong..

21:41.383 --> 21:44.011
...and no matter

21:41.383 --> 21:44.011
how angry I get.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.306
I am always

21:44.053 --> 21:47.306
gonna forgive you.

21:47.347 --> 21:51.060
- Because I love you.

21:47.347 --> 21:51.060
- How can you still love me?

21:51.102 --> 21:54.063
I wrecked Joey's car

21:51.102 --> 21:54.063
and I broke the house.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.857
Steph, those are just things.

21:56.899 --> 22:00.611
We can always buy a new car

21:56.899 --> 22:00.611
or we could put up a new wall.

'But there's only one

22:00.653 --> 22:03.405
Stephanie Judith Tanner.'

22:05.241 --> 22:07.994
And you could

22:05.241 --> 22:07.994
never be replaced.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.871
Gee, I never

22:08.035 --> 22:10.871
thought of that.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.041
I think about it

22:12.290 --> 22:14.041
every day.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.628
I love you, dad.
