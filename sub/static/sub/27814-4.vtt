WEBVTT

00:00.980 --> 00:02.347
Previously on "Cardinal".

00:02.381 --> 00:04.282
What kind of person writes and sends

00:04.317 --> 00:05.817
that kind of card?

00:05.852 --> 00:06.985
Someone who's suffered.

00:07.019 --> 00:07.986
You're a police officer,

00:08.020 --> 00:10.288
you must have your share of enemies?

00:10.323 --> 00:12.023
Did you send the cards.

00:12.058 --> 00:14.292
Man, I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:14.327 --> 00:15.693
You cannot

00:15.728 --> 00:18.296
open up an investigation all by yourself.

00:18.331 --> 00:19.331
You're not gonna let it go.

00:19.365 --> 00:20.532
If you're gonna do it,

00:20.566 --> 00:22.133
do it quieter.

00:22.168 --> 00:23.501
What the-

00:23.536 --> 00:24.870
So why aren't you with Nathan?

00:24.904 --> 00:28.707
I want to be able
to look my son in the eyes

00:28.741 --> 00:30.809
and tell him someone
paid for what they did.

00:30.843 --> 00:32.476
You doing more ATMs today?

00:32.511 --> 00:34.312
Mama told me to lay off.

00:34.347 --> 00:35.380
She seemed mad.

00:35.414 --> 00:38.049
Jack must have done something messed up.

00:38.084 --> 00:39.150
The kid's not wired right.

00:39.185 --> 00:40.423
You gotta be careful Leems,

00:40.458 --> 00:41.853
he'll hurt you.

00:41.888 --> 00:43.655
Lloyd Kreeger.

00:43.689 --> 00:44.656
Where's Henry?

00:44.690 --> 00:45.657
He left.

00:47.026 --> 00:49.828
Sam Duchene. I like your drawings.

00:49.862 --> 00:52.664
Please, leave me alone.

01:12.218 --> 01:13.518
Where is it! Where is it!

01:13.552 --> 01:14.953
Where is it!

01:17.089 --> 01:18.924
Mama! Mama!

01:24.463 --> 01:25.530
Shh shh!

01:25.564 --> 01:26.898
It's Mama.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.433
Shh shh shh!

01:28.467 --> 01:29.868
It's okay.

01:29.902 --> 01:30.936
It's okay.

01:30.970 --> 01:32.237
Shh shh shh.

01:33.572 --> 01:34.739
It's a dream baby.

01:34.907 --> 01:36.741
Shh shh shh shh shh shh!

01:38.444 --> 01:39.644
It's all right.

01:40.279 --> 01:41.780
It's okay.

01:41.814 --> 01:44.716
Shh shh shh shh shh shh!

01:44.750 --> 01:46.217
What's wrong with me?

01:46.252 --> 01:47.585
Nothing.

01:47.620 --> 01:48.887
Nothing's wrong with you.

01:48.921 --> 01:50.889
Shh shh shh shh shh shh.

01:50.923 --> 01:52.390
It's okay.

01:52.425 --> 01:53.792
Shh.

02:02.268 --> 02:03.902
Shh shh shh shh shh shh.

02:11.143 --> 02:12.344
He called her again.

02:13.179 --> 02:15.447
This man has her cell phone.

02:15.481 --> 02:16.581
I must have dropped it

02:16.615 --> 02:17.816
when I jumped.

02:18.317 --> 02:19.951
He's been following me.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.127
That's him.

02:30.963 --> 02:33.631
You drew this?

02:33.666 --> 02:34.866
She's an illustrator.

02:35.167 --> 02:36.801
Goes to college for it.

02:38.704 --> 02:39.671
But you said you-

02:39.705 --> 02:40.939
you didn't get a good look at him.

02:40.973 --> 02:43.641
It was dark, he was wearing a hoodie.

02:43.676 --> 02:44.976
I saw his face at school.

02:45.011 --> 02:46.644
He was wearing the same thing.

02:47.713 --> 02:49.114
This is good.

02:49.148 --> 02:50.515
We can circulate it.

02:56.155 --> 02:57.355
Hey Sam,

02:58.190 --> 02:59.391
are you okay?

03:02.194 --> 03:04.629
I just feel so stupid.

03:04.663 --> 03:06.664
It's Randall Wishart
who should feel stupid.

03:09.068 --> 03:11.870
If this man can find her at school,

03:11.904 --> 03:13.638
he can find her at home.

03:13.672 --> 03:15.040
We're arranging a safehouse.

03:15.341 --> 03:17.175
Until then you can stay with me.

03:43.035 --> 03:45.083
Need to do a little bit of a purge.

03:46.038 --> 03:47.419
Yeah, no kidding.

03:50.743 --> 03:52.077
A married man.

03:52.111 --> 03:54.746
Sam, honestly, what were you thinking?

03:57.716 --> 03:59.117
He said he loved me.

04:00.886 --> 04:02.720
A man like that only loves himself.

04:28.914 --> 04:31.505
Headshot, nice.

04:39.938 --> 04:41.138
It gets easier.

04:42.953 --> 04:44.220
I doubt it.

04:45.097 --> 04:47.065
You did good.

04:47.099 --> 04:48.933
Mama will be proud of you.

04:53.105 --> 04:54.272
Lemur.

04:56.308 --> 04:57.509
No.

05:00.346 --> 05:01.312
We're family.

05:01.347 --> 05:02.780
I mean, not really.

05:04.116 --> 05:06.284
It'll be okay so long as they don't know.

05:06.318 --> 05:07.585
I don't want to.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.793
It's not like you haven't done it before.

05:14.627 --> 05:15.960
Just no, okay?

05:26.305 --> 05:29.140
So where are we with the
Barstows' missing rental car?

05:29.175 --> 05:31.442
We got units patrolling but nothing yet.

05:31.477 --> 05:33.984
Dyson, can we get more units on that?

05:36.315 --> 05:37.515
Sergeant?

05:38.651 --> 05:40.051
Yeah, you'll have them.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.188
We found something new.

05:43.222 --> 05:45.456
Sawdust on Irena Barstow's pants

05:45.491 --> 05:47.692
does not match construction
lumber used for dock repairs

05:47.726 --> 05:48.960
at the marina.

05:48.994 --> 05:51.462
It's white pine, they're using fir.

05:51.497 --> 05:52.697
I know a cabinet guy in town

05:52.731 --> 05:54.165
that works with white pine.

05:56.001 --> 05:57.168
Well done, McLeod.

05:57.203 --> 05:59.671
Cabinet maker did it, we can all go home.

06:01.407 --> 06:02.473
The, uh,

06:02.508 --> 06:05.009
the cabinet maker's
brother he owns this dive bar

06:05.044 --> 06:07.312
where they spread sawdust on the floor.

06:09.215 --> 06:10.815
Anyone want to know where it is?

06:14.019 --> 06:15.153
Heard of it on the radio,

06:15.187 --> 06:18.236
but never seen the pictures before.

06:19.358 --> 06:21.159
So you have seen them?

06:21.193 --> 06:22.527
I think so.

06:22.561 --> 06:24.785
Were they dressed rich like this?

06:26.198 --> 06:28.499
Yes, they were well dressed.

06:28.534 --> 06:29.667
Expensive jewellery.

06:29.702 --> 06:31.035
That's what I remember,

06:31.070 --> 06:32.537
more than the faces.

06:32.571 --> 06:34.172
They stuck out.

06:34.206 --> 06:36.505
Did they say anything to you?

06:37.209 --> 06:39.377
Just ordered.

06:39.411 --> 06:40.578
G&T's maybe?

06:40.613 --> 06:42.180
They were nice,

06:42.214 --> 06:44.182
- tipped well.
- Alana, two draft.

06:44.216 --> 06:47.051
Oh, they were with another guy.

06:47.086 --> 06:48.286
Hm.

06:49.788 --> 06:51.222
This guy?

06:52.057 --> 06:53.858
Uh, no.

06:53.892 --> 06:56.107
The guy they were with was older.

06:56.929 --> 06:58.902
- Um...
- Hey.

07:00.299 --> 07:01.566
I'll get it.

07:03.602 --> 07:05.570
Oh, he was,

07:05.604 --> 07:08.370
like sorta mean looking,

07:09.408 --> 07:10.708
with a neck tattoo.

07:10.743 --> 07:12.777
He was pretty much my type.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.502
Uh, they weren't here just here to drink.

07:16.415 --> 07:18.716
Seemed like they had
business or something.

07:18.751 --> 07:21.586
The scary one showed up with a bag.

07:22.755 --> 07:24.422
Who left with the bag?

07:25.090 --> 07:26.624
I don't know.

07:26.659 --> 07:27.792
But the guy,

07:27.826 --> 07:29.761
he came back the next day.

07:29.795 --> 07:32.764
He sat at the bar all afternoon

07:32.798 --> 07:35.767
nursing a beer and checking his phone

07:35.801 --> 07:37.635
like he was waiting for a call.

07:38.543 --> 07:39.710
Where is it?

07:43.475 --> 07:45.743
This is definitely
the Barstow's rental car.

07:45.778 --> 07:47.245
Anything on the GPS?

07:47.279 --> 07:48.913
Track log was erased.

07:48.947 --> 07:51.249
Can you recover the data?

07:51.283 --> 07:52.450
Possibly.

07:53.952 --> 07:55.586
Okay, so he left it here

07:55.621 --> 07:57.255
after dropping them in the water.

07:57.289 --> 08:00.591
Same deal as Island Road,
lots of material left behind.

08:00.626 --> 08:02.627
Looks like blood here on the seat

08:02.661 --> 08:04.262
and the steering wheel.

08:04.296 --> 08:06.664
Days old at least,
so possibly the victims'.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.033
And take a look at this.

08:12.838 --> 08:15.340
It was under the spare tire.

08:25.351 --> 08:28.286
The guy the Barstows were talking to

08:28.320 --> 08:29.520
he's not a local.

08:30.823 --> 08:32.789
You know all the neck tats in town?

08:32.825 --> 08:35.893
You stay here long enough,
you'll know 'em too.

08:37.328 --> 08:39.163
Well I'm not going anywhere.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.167
Maybe you should have.

08:46.338 --> 08:48.172
What about the assault
rifle in the trunk?

08:51.377 --> 08:52.844
Everybody keeps telling us

08:53.975 --> 08:55.813
what nice people,

08:55.848 --> 08:57.882
good people the Barstows were.

08:57.916 --> 09:00.565
Yup. He's an ex-gun industry guy.

09:01.353 --> 09:03.321
And the weapon is black market.

09:03.355 --> 09:04.822
And they're here for the

09:04.857 --> 09:06.337
- Sportsman's Show.
- Mhm.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.614
It's a good cover.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.194
Big bag of money in the trunk.

09:13.698 --> 09:15.132
The Barstows are gun runners.

09:27.713 --> 09:30.214
♪ you and I

09:34.720 --> 09:37.922
♪ you and I

09:41.727 --> 09:45.331
♪ do or die

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

10:03.415 --> 10:05.716
You wanna shove your attacker's arm up,

10:05.751 --> 10:07.752
when you're out of the strike zone

10:07.786 --> 10:09.551
and you can counter attack.

10:11.423 --> 10:12.590
Seriously?

10:13.125 --> 10:15.726
Up north people are gonna
come at us with knives?

10:15.761 --> 10:16.928
Mama says

10:17.463 --> 10:19.397
we don't know what can happen,

10:19.431 --> 10:20.598
ever.

10:21.266 --> 10:22.834
We need to be prepared for anything.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.484
Like that punk that
talked back at the ATM?

10:27.694 --> 10:28.973
I just put him down.

10:29.007 --> 10:30.241
No hesitation.

10:30.275 --> 10:31.642
Hey, can I play?

10:36.448 --> 10:37.863
We-we were just finishing up.

10:37.897 --> 10:38.983
No, come on man,

10:39.017 --> 10:40.284
let me show you something.

10:40.319 --> 10:41.786
I got something new, huh?

10:42.321 --> 10:43.955
You wanna see something, huh?

10:46.692 --> 10:47.758
See how easy that was?

10:47.793 --> 10:49.293
- I'm okay.
- Let him go.

10:49.328 --> 10:50.428
I'm okay.

10:50.462 --> 10:52.052
See? See how I'm holding him?

10:52.464 --> 10:54.599
You can kill a man this way.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.467
Secret is, you gotta
hold him long enough.

10:57.469 --> 10:58.870
Not just till he goes limp.

10:59.671 --> 11:00.872
Longer.

11:01.340 --> 11:03.188
You learn this from Mama?

11:04.009 --> 11:05.176
No.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.944
My dad used to choke me out

11:06.979 --> 11:08.813
whenever I talked back to him.

11:08.847 --> 11:10.612
Party trick for his buddies.

11:13.552 --> 11:15.853
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jack, stop!

11:15.888 --> 11:17.154
Stop!

11:22.767 --> 11:23.967
It don't matter.

11:25.396 --> 11:26.596
He's dead anyway.

11:33.071 --> 11:35.540
- Come at me, man.
- No.

11:35.574 --> 11:36.841
Come on, just-

11:37.075 --> 11:38.476
Come at me.

11:38.510 --> 11:39.644
Come on Lemur, come at me.

11:39.678 --> 11:40.645
I don't want to.

11:40.679 --> 11:42.647
Come on, come at me, man.

11:42.681 --> 11:44.562
Huh? Just-

11:47.252 --> 11:48.653
What the hell, Jack?

11:48.687 --> 11:50.187
Dick!

11:50.222 --> 11:52.278
What is it with you and women?

11:53.859 --> 11:55.693
What is that supposed to mean?

11:56.061 --> 11:58.062
You wanna tell her
about the girl from Colorado?

12:01.433 --> 12:03.401
Yeah, he wanted her to come with us.

12:03.435 --> 12:04.869
But she didn't want to.

12:06.538 --> 12:08.205
Didn't turn out good for her, did it?

12:10.542 --> 12:11.842
You gonna do the same thing with

12:11.877 --> 12:13.344
the girl that drew that picture

12:13.378 --> 12:14.779
you've been carrying around?

12:17.883 --> 12:19.584
You see, Mama and I,

12:19.618 --> 12:22.186
we could replace you.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.754
Both of you could disappear

12:23.789 --> 12:26.057
and no one would even know you were gone.

13:15.243 --> 13:16.443
John, Lise-

13:16.577 --> 13:19.279
you know that suspect of yours
with the crow neck tat?

13:19.714 --> 13:21.348
What about him?

13:21.382 --> 13:22.916
Uni spotted the guy on Fraser,

13:22.950 --> 13:24.751
tried to grill him about the Barstows.

13:24.786 --> 13:28.021
Wasn't cooperating so the poor
kid tried to strong-arm him.

13:28.055 --> 13:30.023
Uh, didn't turn out too well
for either one of them.

13:30.057 --> 13:31.024
Where is he now?

13:31.058 --> 13:33.460
Uh, kid's getting stitches
but your guy's in holding.

13:33.594 --> 13:35.762
Misha Pulaski,

13:36.150 --> 13:37.416
you're gonna love him.

13:37.899 --> 13:39.900
We have a witness who
saw you with the Barstows

13:39.934 --> 13:40.901
at the bar.

13:40.935 --> 13:42.002
You had a bag.

13:42.036 --> 13:44.538
Same bag was found in
their abandoned rental car.

13:44.572 --> 13:45.972
Along with their blood.

13:47.742 --> 13:49.709
The last and only time I saw those folks

13:49.744 --> 13:51.044
was at the Chinook.

13:51.078 --> 13:52.690
Where you were buying guns.

13:54.415 --> 13:55.782
Okay, we know you were with them

13:55.817 --> 13:57.451
and we know what they do.

13:58.252 --> 14:00.420
Good, so you know they were not here

14:00.455 --> 14:03.089
to sell pretty bows and arrows, hm?

14:03.124 --> 14:05.559
How long have they been coming
here to sell illegal weapons?

14:05.593 --> 14:06.560
I couldn't tell you.

14:06.594 --> 14:08.628
Okay. So you just decided
to give them a bag

14:08.663 --> 14:10.625
with fifty thousand dollars?

14:11.098 --> 14:13.900
Sure. Down payment on some hunting bows

14:13.935 --> 14:15.101
for Christmas.

14:15.136 --> 14:17.771
You know, my sisters,
they love those Hunger Games.

14:18.005 --> 14:19.272
Listen to me.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.241
You assaulted a police officer,

14:21.275 --> 14:22.909
that's not going away.

14:22.944 --> 14:25.412
Now, we can't charge you for a
gun deal that never happened,

14:25.446 --> 14:27.948
but we can focus on you

14:27.982 --> 14:29.727
as a murder suspect.

14:32.954 --> 14:35.255
Look. You think if I knew
where those guns were,

14:35.289 --> 14:37.123
I would still be here? Hm?

14:38.458 --> 14:39.725
Then tell us this-

14:40.461 --> 14:43.263
how many guns do you think the
Barstows brought here to sell.

14:43.297 --> 14:45.159
Oh, even if I had to guess?

14:45.633 --> 14:47.634
Oh, they brought enough to fight an army.

15:03.484 --> 15:04.684
Shoes.

15:08.489 --> 15:09.656
Seriously?

15:11.245 --> 15:13.563
We live with a psychopath,
you're worried about shoes?

15:16.063 --> 15:17.631
It never hurts to have manners.

15:17.665 --> 15:19.499
Okay, whatever Mama's boy.

15:25.506 --> 15:26.873
I'm sorry I let him hit you.

15:33.514 --> 15:35.081
Lemme make it up to you, Nik.

15:37.718 --> 15:39.152
If you could have one cool thing

15:39.186 --> 15:41.354
to bring up north with you,
what would it be?

15:44.859 --> 15:46.693
A new pair of True Religion jeans.

15:49.530 --> 15:51.197
Super skinny, indigo dark.

15:56.537 --> 15:57.871
I'm gonna get you a pair.

15:57.905 --> 15:59.105
No way.

16:01.108 --> 16:02.075
We gotta lay low, Leems.

16:02.109 --> 16:03.176
We can't roll up to the mall

16:03.210 --> 16:05.045
and knock off a jean store.

16:06.047 --> 16:07.714
It's not the jeans I'm stealing.

16:27.013 --> 16:28.180
- Your kill?
- Mhm.

16:29.770 --> 16:30.937
Nice.

16:33.814 --> 16:35.448
What happened to your face?

16:37.778 --> 16:39.379
- You do this to your sister?
- No, he didn't.

16:39.413 --> 16:40.580
Then what happened?

16:49.423 --> 16:51.124
You want to learn how to
field dress a rabbit Nikki?

16:51.158 --> 16:52.792
I've had enough blood for one day.

16:53.961 --> 16:55.929
I'll take this to the old man.

17:12.445 --> 17:13.613
You want half?

17:15.856 --> 17:17.022
I'm gluten free.

17:18.885 --> 17:20.051
Of course you are.

17:23.236 --> 17:24.869
What are you worth, anyway?

17:26.487 --> 17:27.961
That's none of your business.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.715
Don't matter.

17:31.198 --> 17:33.033
Money's not gonna be worth anything soon.

17:34.468 --> 17:35.635
All this?

17:36.372 --> 17:37.771
Gone.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.172
Seeya.

17:39.206 --> 17:40.607
That what she tells you?

17:40.641 --> 17:41.975
That woman that

17:42.009 --> 17:43.629
pretends to be your mom?

17:44.679 --> 17:45.879
Yeah.

17:48.228 --> 17:50.469
I'll listen to her over a
rich old perv like you.

17:51.652 --> 17:52.786
I saw you looking at me.

17:52.820 --> 17:53.987
No-

17:55.022 --> 17:56.222
you did not.

18:01.369 --> 18:02.635
Finish your food.

18:13.908 --> 18:15.542
What did you do with Henry?

18:18.746 --> 18:20.013
My friend,

18:20.681 --> 18:21.848
Henry.

18:23.344 --> 18:24.777
I don't know anything about him.

18:28.522 --> 18:30.356
If you're out by the bunkhouse would ya

18:30.858 --> 18:32.553
take a look around for him.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.514
For me?

18:39.700 --> 18:40.867
Look.

18:42.036 --> 18:43.870
If you help me out here,

18:43.904 --> 18:46.108
I'll give you more money

18:46.607 --> 18:49.442
than you have ever seen in your life.

18:54.715 --> 18:55.882
No thanks.

18:57.885 --> 19:00.053
You know, Mama and Jack
went out to the bunkhouse

19:00.087 --> 19:01.287
before we got here.

19:02.556 --> 19:04.224
Said there was nobody there.

19:06.727 --> 19:08.561
Maybe your friend just got tired of you.

19:55.609 --> 19:57.805
Whoever did kill them was a customer

19:58.145 --> 20:00.079
and they or the Barstows
found an empty house

20:00.114 --> 20:01.726
to set up the exchange.

20:02.483 --> 20:03.817
If the killer had got those guns,

20:03.851 --> 20:05.896
he could be long gone by now.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.508
You want to get something to eat?

20:09.790 --> 20:10.957
No, I can't.

20:10.991 --> 20:13.459
I've got to relieve Kular at
the ATM thing he's still on.

20:13.494 --> 20:14.694
Can I help?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.575
No sense in wrecking both our nights.

20:31.645 --> 20:33.479
Hey, Kel, do you wanna get some pizza?

20:35.216 --> 20:38.012
I-I thought you were working tonight.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.154
No I'm out with friends right now.

20:43.157 --> 20:47.188
Maybe we could do pizza tomorrow instead?

20:47.661 --> 20:48.795
Oh, yeah.

20:48.829 --> 20:49.963
Yeah, tomorrow's fine.

20:49.997 --> 20:52.031
I'll talk to you then.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.499
Okay.

20:54.081 --> 20:55.281
Bye.

20:57.176 --> 20:58.343
Thanks.

21:07.214 --> 21:08.414
Hm.

21:41.115 --> 21:42.382
Yeah?

21:43.050 --> 21:44.217
Delivery.

21:58.265 --> 21:59.532
I didn't order anything.

21:59.566 --> 22:01.137
Roger Felt,

22:01.802 --> 22:03.202
I have reason to
believe you're in breach.

22:03.237 --> 22:04.237
You can't come in here.

22:04.271 --> 22:05.738
I need to have a look around.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.907
Let me see your warrant.

22:08.575 --> 22:09.776
You're a convicted felon,

22:09.810 --> 22:11.522
no warrant required.

22:13.914 --> 22:14.948
Whatever you think I've done-

22:14.982 --> 22:16.282
I've been speaking

22:16.317 --> 22:18.785
with Desmond's Funeral Home

22:18.819 --> 22:21.888
about the invoice for my wife's funeral.

22:21.922 --> 22:24.057
They say it came from their accountant.

22:24.091 --> 22:26.559
And that their accountant is you.

22:26.593 --> 22:28.261
Performing accountancy services.

22:28.295 --> 22:30.207
That's a direct violation.

22:31.465 --> 22:32.665
Beckwith and Beaulne,

22:33.834 --> 22:34.901
those your partners?

22:34.935 --> 22:36.069
Can I speak with them?

22:36.103 --> 22:37.770
They don't exist. It-it's me.

22:37.805 --> 22:39.939
Add running a fictitious company

22:39.974 --> 22:41.407
to the list.

22:56.991 --> 22:58.569
Get your shoes on.

23:18.695 --> 23:20.530
Something you want to ask me?

23:25.903 --> 23:28.524
The old man said he had a friend,

23:28.549 --> 23:29.816
Henry.

23:31.955 --> 23:33.854
Just wanted to know

23:36.244 --> 23:37.611
if he was still here.

23:39.614 --> 23:41.081
Henry was here.

23:43.618 --> 23:44.718
When you were down by the road,

23:44.752 --> 23:46.753
we went into the bunkhouse
and waited for him.

23:47.822 --> 23:49.656
I had Jack slit his throat.

23:56.097 --> 23:57.264
That upset you?

24:00.434 --> 24:01.835
Why would you do that?

24:06.474 --> 24:07.741
A month from now

24:07.775 --> 24:09.142
or a year from now,

24:10.845 --> 24:11.945
everything's gonna be in ruin.

24:11.979 --> 24:13.613
Everybody's gonna be dead,

24:16.117 --> 24:18.118
and those that aren't are
gonna wish they were.

24:20.187 --> 24:21.821
What we did for Henry was a kindness.

24:26.027 --> 24:27.294
So...

24:30.665 --> 24:32.132
what about the old man?

24:35.670 --> 24:37.504
You're afraid he's gonna be your job?

24:41.042 --> 24:42.309
I promise you,

24:43.678 --> 24:46.513
I'm not going to ask you do
anything you're not ready for.

26:24.612 --> 26:26.746
Felt's in breach of his parole.

26:26.781 --> 26:29.382
Which is something for
his parole officer to handle,

26:29.417 --> 26:30.450
not a senior detective

26:30.484 --> 26:31.718
in the middle of an open
murder investigation.

26:31.752 --> 26:34.254
This is not like Codwallader.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.755
Okay. I have evidence.

26:36.323 --> 26:37.757
He's behind these cards.

26:38.993 --> 26:40.260
Look.

26:43.264 --> 26:44.731
There's an obvious printing flaw.

26:44.765 --> 26:45.732
Look at the T.

26:45.766 --> 26:46.733
Alright?

26:46.767 --> 26:48.902
Here is an invoice from his office.

26:48.936 --> 26:50.926
Same printing flaw.

26:53.274 --> 26:56.076
I put him in prison six years ago

26:56.110 --> 26:57.310
for fraud.

26:59.013 --> 27:00.644
This is his revenge.

27:17.832 --> 27:19.032
Jesus.

27:21.836 --> 27:24.293
I can't let you question him alone.

27:27.475 --> 27:28.641
I got your cards.

27:29.310 --> 27:30.877
Something you want to tell us?

27:31.679 --> 27:33.113
You don't have to say anything.

27:33.147 --> 27:34.636
That's alright.

27:36.984 --> 27:38.184
I didn't mean to-

27:41.155 --> 27:42.789
I lost everything because of you

27:42.823 --> 27:44.457
and you didn't even give
me a second thought.

27:44.492 --> 27:46.231
So I just wanted-

27:47.728 --> 27:49.162
I just wanted you to know how it felt.

27:49.196 --> 27:50.396
I-

27:52.199 --> 27:53.399
I'm sorry.

27:55.202 --> 27:56.402
You didn't deserve this.

27:57.193 --> 27:58.304
I'm sorry.

27:58.339 --> 27:59.506
Roger,

28:00.875 --> 28:03.207
where were you on the
night of August 14th?

28:04.512 --> 28:05.678
What?

28:07.248 --> 28:09.713
Where were you the night my wife died?

28:10.885 --> 28:12.085
What?

28:12.686 --> 28:13.720
No.

28:13.754 --> 28:15.321
No I didn't,

28:15.356 --> 28:16.422
no I wouldn't,

28:16.457 --> 28:17.857
I wouldn't do that-
- Maybe we should take a break.

28:17.892 --> 28:19.325
Roger, don't say another word.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.016
I was-

28:21.529 --> 28:23.229
I don't know where I was.

28:23.264 --> 28:24.497
I don't know where I was.

28:24.532 --> 28:25.498
Roger, stop.

28:25.533 --> 28:27.700
I-I, you can check my calendar.

28:27.735 --> 28:28.701
I can check my calendar.

28:28.736 --> 28:29.903
Whatever you want.

28:29.937 --> 28:32.672
You can check my computer
but I would not do this.

28:32.706 --> 28:35.842
I mean, I-I sent those
but I-I wouldn't do that.

28:35.876 --> 28:37.825
You have to say something!

28:39.547 --> 28:41.347
I didn't, I wouldn't do that.

28:41.382 --> 28:42.882
I didn't do that.

28:42.917 --> 28:44.117
I didn't do that.

28:45.286 --> 28:48.502
No. I sent the cards
but I wouldn't do that.

28:50.457 --> 28:51.524
I wouldn't.

28:51.559 --> 28:53.126
You have to listen to me.

29:06.128 --> 29:07.229
Anything?

29:07.263 --> 29:08.430
Quiet so far.

29:10.132 --> 29:11.567
Go home for a few hours.

29:12.901 --> 29:14.031
You sure?

29:14.343 --> 29:15.509
Yeah.

29:20.309 --> 29:21.752
- Okay.
- Bye.

29:33.956 --> 29:35.423
Uh, 403, that minivan.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.425
Is that the second time he's come by?

29:37.460 --> 29:39.261
Negative, different car.

29:41.256 --> 29:42.589
10-42 in progress.

29:42.624 --> 29:43.891
105 Main Street.

30:02.238 --> 30:03.443
Request immediate backup.

30:03.478 --> 30:05.704
ATM, on the corner of Main and Ferguson.

30:07.448 --> 30:08.882
Miss, are you hurt?

30:08.917 --> 30:10.500
No, I think I'm okay.

30:11.085 --> 30:12.219
Okay. where did he go?

30:12.253 --> 30:13.587
That way.

30:13.621 --> 30:14.822
Okay. Help is coming.

30:32.473 --> 30:33.607
Hey!

30:33.641 --> 30:34.908
Police!

30:34.943 --> 30:36.310
Hey! Stop!

30:38.112 --> 30:40.247
Stop! Police!

31:07.976 --> 31:09.142
Police!

31:09.477 --> 31:10.677
Police!

31:40.174 --> 31:41.308
Police!

31:41.342 --> 31:42.509
Don't move!

31:55.023 --> 31:56.223
Marcus?

31:59.219 --> 32:00.327
- Okay, I'll be back.
- Okay.

32:00.361 --> 32:01.561
I'll get help.

32:02.530 --> 32:03.730
Did you see anyone?!

32:04.165 --> 32:05.532
No. Nothing.

32:05.566 --> 32:07.134
You stay with him!

32:07.168 --> 32:09.077
Get EMS here now!

32:54.716 --> 32:55.682
Yeah.

32:55.717 --> 32:57.017
It's me.

32:57.051 --> 32:58.185
I need your help.

32:58.219 --> 32:59.386
Where are you?

33:33.488 --> 33:35.055
What are you doing here?

33:35.089 --> 33:36.089
I messed up.

33:36.124 --> 33:38.333
I just wanted to do
something nice for Nikki.

33:40.128 --> 33:41.561
Give me your hand.

33:41.596 --> 33:43.397
Go easy, I think my ribs are broken.

33:44.432 --> 33:45.632
Hey.

33:46.634 --> 33:49.177
Mama doesn't see how weak you are,

33:50.271 --> 33:51.513
But I do.

33:52.273 --> 33:53.473
Goodbye, brother.

33:53.508 --> 33:54.941
Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!

35:34.095 --> 35:36.095
Ok, thanks.

35:38.008 --> 35:40.343
So, the plates and the VIN don't match.

35:40.377 --> 35:42.311
Car was reported stolen
from Pearson Airport

35:42.346 --> 35:43.546
a couple weeks ago.

35:44.214 --> 35:45.948
They'll fume for prints back at the shop,

35:45.983 --> 35:47.283
but that may take a while.

35:47.317 --> 35:48.284
In the meantime,

35:48.318 --> 35:49.886
I've got a present from the van.

35:53.991 --> 35:55.558
This is Roman Barstow's wallet.

35:57.995 --> 35:59.996
Island Road and the ATMs are connected.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.596
If the van was stolen
from airport parking

36:05.597 --> 36:07.565
there must be security footage somewhere.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.799
I'm on it.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.101
What happened with the civilian?

36:13.772 --> 36:14.939
He's dead.

36:16.775 --> 36:17.975
What a waste.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.311
Yeah.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.306
None of us wanted to
believe she could have done it.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.010
I would have seen it coming.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.980
People have secrets.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.650
You do this job, you know that.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.319
But this-

37:03.655 --> 37:05.665
This has to stop.

37:08.193 --> 37:10.294
Even if there was a little doubt,

37:10.328 --> 37:11.629
I would not have let it go.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.965
Lise Delorme would not have let it go.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.400
Roger Felt-

37:30.582 --> 37:32.216
Roger Felt

37:32.250 --> 37:34.218
was just a bitter prick

37:34.252 --> 37:36.086
who used your grief to hurt you.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.972
We have two more bodies

38:03.548 --> 38:06.850
linking Island Road and
the ATM robberies, yes.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.352
Any chance one of those bodies

38:08.386 --> 38:10.220
belongs to the Island Road killer?

38:11.222 --> 38:12.890
He's still out there.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.260
We have a dead civilian.

38:18.229 --> 38:19.730
Marcus Glover,

38:19.764 --> 38:21.398
father of the ATM victim.

38:22.767 --> 38:24.401
He wanted to get revenge.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.805
What happened with Cardinal?

38:29.407 --> 38:31.108
I should have sent him back on leave

38:31.142 --> 38:32.109
the minute I found out

38:32.143 --> 38:33.777
he was digging into this stuff.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.281
And the cards again.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.484
It's more than just the cards.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.086
He told me

38:42.921 --> 38:45.756
he doesn't believe
Catherine killed herself.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.594
He didn't tell you?

38:56.167 --> 38:58.235
I thought this was something he

38:58.269 --> 38:59.770
needed to get out of his system.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.638
I didn't realize how bad it was.

39:06.463 --> 39:08.464
You tell me what you need, Lise.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.281
Are you better off with Cardinal,

39:11.316 --> 39:12.516
or without him?

39:30.168 --> 39:31.802
The ATM suspect is dead.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.638
Shot point blank in the forehead.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.142
Just like the Barstows.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.811
We have evidence it's
the Island Road killer.

39:43.648 --> 39:45.482
So, they knew each other.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.318
Partnership gone wrong maybe.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.293
What, they're in town buying guns,

39:56.327 --> 39:58.295
uh, they're robbing ATMs to pay for them-

39:58.329 --> 39:59.696
Why didn't you tell me?

40:07.005 --> 40:07.971
You see Dyson's memo.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.840
Yeah, I told her to write it.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.314
I have to do this, Lise,
because nobody around here,

40:17.348 --> 40:18.756
you included, will.

40:18.790 --> 40:20.818
So you think I let
Catherine's death slide?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.319
That's not what this is about.

40:22.353 --> 40:24.721
We can't afford to have
the Barstow investigation

40:24.756 --> 40:25.856
come under review-

40:25.890 --> 40:27.867
I told you it's not, it won't.

40:28.739 --> 40:29.906
No it won't.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.229
Because you're giving this to me now.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.601
So, what evidence do you have?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.237
I have the suicide note that Catherine-

40:40.271 --> 40:42.757
John-
- Wrote weeks before she died.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.008
I have the cards.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.343
I, it's more than that.

40:46.377 --> 40:47.377
No. You don't believe she did it.

40:47.412 --> 40:48.846
And that should-
- That's what it is.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.640
- That should be enough.
- No it's not.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.217
It's not enough.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.054
Don't come in tomorrow.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.288
Take the weekend.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.567
And come back when you're
ready to work with me.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.061
Uh, Lise.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.096
Yeah?

41:06.131 --> 41:07.965
We got the video footage from Pearson.

41:08.671 --> 41:09.872
Okay, thank you.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.239
It's Thanksgiving.

41:16.407 --> 41:17.774
Spend time with Kelly.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.079
She needs you.

41:30.666 --> 41:32.098
That's definitely the vehicle.

41:37.438 --> 41:38.605
There.

41:39.106 --> 41:40.941
That looks like our ATM thief.

41:45.146 --> 41:47.614
Well who the hell is that woman with him?

42:30.324 --> 42:32.325
Feel better knowing the truth?

42:33.494 --> 42:34.861
It rarely does.
