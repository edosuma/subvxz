WEBVTT

01:57.520 --> 02:00.592
- What will you do if they won't go?
- Go on alone, of course.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.630
<i>Pax vobiscum,</i> my sons.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.712
<i>Et cum spiritu tuo.</i>

02:30.800 --> 02:33.268
You're both English, are you not?
Yes.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.920
You're the first white man
we've seen in three months.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.709
You two are the first I've seen in 40 years.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.399
My name is Glendon.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.835
This is my assistant, Hugh Renwick.
We're botanists.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.230
He's a botanist. I'm a nobody
he brought along out of kindness.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.390
I wanted to see
the last places on earth.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.118
Why are you here?

02:51.360 --> 02:53.794
We're looking for
the <i>Mariphasa lupina lumina...</i>

02:54.120 --> 02:56.554
a strange flower which grows only in Tibet...

02:56.640 --> 02:59.757
and which, it is said,
takes its life from the moon.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.308
Is there really such a flower, Father?

03:02.400 --> 03:05.836
There are some things
it is better not to bother with.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.031
Why do you say that, Father?

03:10.120 --> 03:12.429
- You aren't afraid, are you?
- No.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.350
But I respect
some of the superstitions of others.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.708
Often they are founded in fact.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.156
Our coolies tell us, the valley
we want to see is filled with demons.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.959
Yes, I'm afraid they thought
you were one of them.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.473
That's why they ran away.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.869
I've never been into that valley...

03:29.960 --> 03:33.191
and I've never known a man to return from it.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.672
Then we were right. This is the place.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.320
According to this map,
it's just beyond that ridge...

03:39.400 --> 03:41.118
just off the trail.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.754
- Are you game?
- Wish us luck, Father.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.432
- Get the ponies.
- Right.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.192
You are foolish...

03:47.360 --> 03:51.592
but without fools there would be no wisdom.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.589
<i>Pax vobiscum.</i>
Thank you, Father.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.671
Think of all the trouble we've been
through these past six months...

04:16.760 --> 04:18.557
just for the sake of a little flower.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.269
Yes. But it's the only one
of its kind in the whole worid.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.670
We're going to go on climbing.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.917
I say, Glendon!
What?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.833
I can't move! Something's holding my feet!

04:34.920 --> 04:37.480
Nonsense. Lift them. Come on.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.431
- Are you all right now?
- I seem to be.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.988
- What was the matter?
- I don't know.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.915
It's the strangest feeling.
The sort you have in a dream.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.508
Your feet won't move.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.318
Don't let it get you, old boy.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.188
Autosuggestion, self-hypnosis:
The basis of all superstition.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.639
What happened?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.152
Something struck me.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.757
Wilfred, what are you doing?

08:29.120 --> 08:33.272
Sorry, dear. I lost all track of time.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.035
Everybody's asking for you.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.594
I've been working on an experiment.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.912
What's the matter? Is something
wrong? I mean, am I all right?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.433
Dear old bear.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.829
Nothing interests you anymore...

08:50.040 --> 08:51.996
except your mouldy old secrets in there.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.798
Not even your wife.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.359
I promise you, my darling...

08:55.440 --> 08:57.795
that as soon as I've completed
that experiment...

08:57.880 --> 09:00.394
I'll try to be more... Well, more human.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.754
It isn't in you.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.478
Ever since you came back from Tibet...

09:03.560 --> 09:06.632
I've felt you were planning to
divorce me and marry a laboratory.

09:08.920 --> 09:12.230
I'll not only divorce you,
but I'll beat you as well...

09:12.320 --> 09:14.880
if ever again you get me mixed up
in a mess like this.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.916
Don't blame me. Blame the Botanical Society.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.989
I know, but I...

09:18.080 --> 09:19.718
Here's Aunt Ettie. Let's get out...

09:19.800 --> 09:23.031
or she'll be battering down the
doors. I'll have no secrets left.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.874
Wilfred, how sweet of you to let us
all in on you today this way.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.310
Can you really make artificial moonlight?

09:29.400 --> 09:31.834
I can't wait until I see your new laboratory.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.353
Deadline, Aunt Ettie.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.158
He won't even let me go in there.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.912
Oh, Chanel. Sweet.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.719
<i>But you look a bit down.</i>
<i>What's the matter, Lisa?</i>

09:40.360 --> 09:43.716
My dear wife has just been scolding me.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.595
Yes, how you manage to keep
your dear wife is a mystery to me.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.036
Skirmishing off the way you do.
Leaving her alone, months on end.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.350
Anyhow, I knew the risk I took
when I married...

09:53.440 --> 09:55.192
one of the black Glendons of Malvern.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.952
Marrying any man is risky.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.474
Marrying a famous man
is kissing catastrophe.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.028
Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.191
Good heavens!
What is that wicked thing doing?

10:18.120 --> 10:20.680
It trapped that poor, dear little fly.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.479
It's going to eat that poor, dear little fly.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.673
How revolting.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.591
I wonder where is
that horrible Madagascar plant?

10:35.360 --> 10:36.952
The one that eats mice and men.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.871
Mice and spiders, Miss Ettie.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.355
It's over there. Shall we take a look?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.438
- They'll be feeding it soon.
- No. I'll have my own tea first.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.795
I may lose it after I've seen the thing...

10:46.880 --> 10:48.711
but I shall have it anyway.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.794
Please don't yank me, Paul.
It irritates me to be yanked.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.995
I'm sorry, Granny.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.436
But I've just seen someone
I want to speak to. There she is.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.709
Alice, darling.
Oh, my dear, how are you?

11:01.800 --> 11:04.109
- Do you know Mr. Renwick?
- How do you do?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.918
- Mr...
- How do you do, Ames?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.316
I must have my tea, quick.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.432
My tongue is hanging out.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.239
You do pick up the oddest phrases,
don't you, Ettie?

11:14.320 --> 11:17.551
I got that one
from your delightful grandson here.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.994
You take Lady Forsythe. I'll take Capt...

11:21.080 --> 11:22.991
- Ames.
- Of course.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.433
I never knew anyone...

11:25.520 --> 11:28.273
who could scuttle about as quickly
as Ettie Coombes can.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.315
Lisa.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.395
Here's a young man who says
he used to be a beau of yours.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.675
Paul! I read you were in England.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.036
I wondered if...
Lisa, how great to see you again.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.112
I simply adore to travel. Simply adore it.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.435
He used to be a beau of hers.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.110
I say, you've got a lovely garden here.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.235
Haven't we?

11:53.320 --> 11:57.313
I simply jitter to go to Java. Simply jitter.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.549
Yes.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.432
"Simply jitter to go to Java.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.876
"I simply jitter to go to Java."

12:07.960 --> 12:11.032
Wilfred, I want you to meet
a very dear friend, Paul Ames.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.712
How do you do, sir?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.997
Mrs. Glendon and I used to throw jam
in each other's hair as kids...

12:16.080 --> 12:19.152
and sail off the stable roof
on improvised parachutes.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.994
I've heard about your more
recent exploits, as everyone has.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.150
My wife never told me that she knew you.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.198
- We've known one another for ages.
- Yes, quite a time.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.999
Oh, yes. He proposed to her once.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.589
When I was six, and he was twelve.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.758
That was ages ago.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.238
Are you planning on staying
in England long?

12:43.840 --> 12:46.070
No. I return to California on the fourth.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.434
I've made my home there.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.159
How does it feel to have
a flying school of one's own?

12:50.240 --> 12:52.708
To be able to hop across
from San Francisco to Tokio...

12:52.800 --> 12:53.994
in the twinkling of an eye?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.389
At this moment, I ask nothing more of life.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.674
Really?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.309
A very enchanting mood to be in:

13:00.800 --> 13:02.631
To ask nothing more of life.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.350
Are you in that mood, Lisa?

13:05.760 --> 13:09.036
Anyway, I'm in that mood.
All these lovely flowers about.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.630
How true. Only God can make a daffodil.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.030
The poet said, "Only God
can make a tree," Aunt Ettie.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.112
Isn't it just as difficult
to make a daffodil, Wilfred?

13:19.200 --> 13:20.349
Much more so.

13:23.720 --> 13:28.032
Here's a nice, fat frog for you,
my dear Carnelia. Here we are.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.156
Ettie Coombes, what's happened?

13:35.240 --> 13:38.357
- A plant just ate a frog.
- A what?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.311
- A what?
- Frog.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.118
Heretic! Bringing a beastly thing
like that into Christian England.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.954
Nature is very tolerant, sir.
She has no creeds.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.074
Quite so.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.431
May I congratulate you, sir...

14:02.520 --> 14:05.512
on the amazing collection of plants
you've assembled here.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.794
Thank you.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.314
Evolution was in a strange mood...

14:09.880 --> 14:12.713
- when that creation came along.
- Yes.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.832
It makes one wonder...

14:14.920 --> 14:17.480
just where the plant worid leaves off...

14:17.560 --> 14:19.391
and the animal worid begins.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.190
Have I met you before, sir?

14:27.320 --> 14:30.710
In Tibet, once. But only for a moment...

14:31.240 --> 14:34.152
- in the dark.
- In the dark?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.270
Let me introduce myself again.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.036
DR. YOGAMl: I am Dr. Yogami.
How do you do, sir?

14:42.120 --> 14:46.033
Like yourself, a student, a nurturist of plants.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.193
Dr. Yogami.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.589
Pardon?

15:05.680 --> 15:08.911
Do I understand you to say,
that we met in Tibet?

15:09.880 --> 15:10.949
Yes.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.353
And unless I'm mistaken,
we were both on a similar mission.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.549
Yes?

15:17.840 --> 15:20.195
Would it be intrusive if I should ask you...

15:20.280 --> 15:22.669
- if you were successful?
- In what?

15:23.040 --> 15:25.759
In obtaining a specimen...

15:25.840 --> 15:28.195
of the <i>Mariphasa lumina lupina:</i>

15:28.520 --> 15:31.114
The phosphorescent wolf flower.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.793
Well, you know...

15:33.360 --> 15:35.828
it blooms only under the rays of the moon.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.155
My specimens died on the journey back.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.794
As a scientist, sir, as a botanist...

15:42.360 --> 15:44.351
you actually believe that this flower...

15:44.440 --> 15:47.955
- takes its life from moonlight?
- I do.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.318
So far I've been unsuccessful...

15:50.400 --> 15:52.516
in persuading mine to bloom by moonlight...

15:52.600 --> 15:54.033
or any other kind of light.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.519
Let me see them.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.672
I'm very sorry.
I'll have to ask you to excuse me.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.034
May I go along with you?

16:02.560 --> 16:03.629
Lee!

16:05.600 --> 16:07.511
- You'll pardon me?
- Of course.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.597
No one's called me Lee for years.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.033
So what's happened to you?

16:11.120 --> 16:13.873
You were the gayest,
happiest creature in the worid once.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.871
What's happened to you?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.758
I have a toothache today.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.879
I never seem to be able
to rise above a toothache.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.269
It makes me want to howl, break things...

16:23.360 --> 16:25.191
pull noses, tweak ears, screech.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.475
Yes, you were always
a good screecher as a child.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.710
But I'll say this for you, you were truthful.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.677
I'd hate to see you turn into a liar.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.795
Liar?

16:32.880 --> 16:35.838
Yes, it isn't a toothache
that's troubling you today.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.275
Won't you tell an old pal how to help?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.389
How?

16:40.720 --> 16:42.756
- Shut up.
- I see.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.598
It's been great seeing you.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.477
Now I'd better go and find Wilfred.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.437
He's probably looking everywhere for me.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.590
I can't bear to see you change like this.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.319
You, who used to rear at the drop of a hat.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.231
A wild pair we were, weren't we?

16:56.320 --> 16:59.118
High-headed, hard at the bit,
quick with the heels.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.111
How we used to fight. Remember?

17:01.200 --> 17:04.237
Yes. Where's all that lovely fight gone?

17:05.079 --> 17:08.516
There's been no fight in me
since the night we broke things off.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.713
This flower is an antidote for what?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.638
Werewolfery.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.311
Lycanthrophobia is the medical term...

17:25.960 --> 17:27.518
for the affliction I speak of.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.478
And do you expect me to believe
that a man so affected...

17:30.600 --> 17:32.511
actually becomes a wolf...

17:32.600 --> 17:35.114
under the influence of the full moon?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.315
No.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.713
The werewolf is neither man nor wolf...

17:40.240 --> 17:44.870
but a satanic creature,
with the worst qualities of both.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.548
I'm afraid, sir, that I gave up
my belief in goblins, witches...

17:51.040 --> 17:54.237
personal devils, and werewolves...

17:54.520 --> 17:56.192
at the age of six.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.990
But that does not alter the fact...

17:59.200 --> 18:02.078
that in workaday, modern London today...

18:02.520 --> 18:04.351
at this very moment...

18:04.760 --> 18:08.639
there are two cases of werewolfery
known to me.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.430
And how did these unfortunate gentlemen...

18:15.520 --> 18:18.717
contract this medieval unpleasantness?

18:20.440 --> 18:23.238
From the bite of another werewolf.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.755
These men are doomed but for this flower...

18:37.760 --> 18:39.239
the <i>Mariphasa.</i>

18:41.840 --> 18:43.478
There you are, Wilfred.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.154
- Your wife?
- Yes.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.793
This is my wife. Dr. Yogami.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.117
How do you do?

18:54.720 --> 18:57.996
May I visit
your conservatories again one day?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.350
- Of course, yes.
- Thank you.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.158
What a strange man.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.429
Yes.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.955
See, man. See that moon vine.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.671
That only blooms at night.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.350
If I've deceived that vine,
surely I can deceive <i>Mariphasa!</i>

19:42.760 --> 19:43.909
I don't know, sir.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.356
I got a feeling that <i>Mariphasa</i>
ain't a human plant, sir...

19:47.800 --> 19:49.518
not like this vine.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.715
Look.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.079
Look, man!

20:10.120 --> 20:11.872
What did I tell you?

20:15.640 --> 20:19.599
And these two buds
should bloom before tonight.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.278
Hawkins, go and get your dinner.
Dinner, sir?

20:35.360 --> 20:38.033
Go. Get out. You make me nervous.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.112
Don't stand there staring at me
all solemn and owl-eyed.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.952
Yes, sir. Certainly.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.076
Of course, Mr. Plympton,
you being a mere indoor person...

21:45.160 --> 21:47.151
has no idea of the mysteries of nature.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.869
Most interesting, what you've been
telling me, Mr. Hawkins.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.355
And so them rings make moonlight, do they?

21:53.440 --> 21:56.159
You have the idea, Mr. Plympton,
in a manner of speaking.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.798
Not that it's easy to grasp.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.031
But there's a very scary thought,
if you come to consider it.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.951
Yes? And what might that be?

22:03.040 --> 22:05.634
It don't leave nothing for heaven to do.

22:05.720 --> 22:06.789
Quite so.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.155
If you please, not on the glass, thank you.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.232
Now, perhaps, you'll be good enough
to go and tell Dr. Glendon...

22:12.320 --> 22:14.390
the missus is hoping he'll come in for tea.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.516
Not a chance, I assure you, of his coming.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.910
- Not a chance, Mr. Hawkins?
- Not a chance, Mr. Plympton.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.868
Upstart.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.398
Did you speak, Mr. Hawkins?

22:25.480 --> 22:27.994
I did, Mr. Plympton, but not to you.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.998
More tea?
No, thanks.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.399
- No, thank you.
- No, dear.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.552
I have to get back to London
before the evening traffic starts.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.872
I'll never forgive you, Lisa, if you
don't come to my party tonight.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.636
Everyone in the worid will be there.
Definitely everyone in the worid.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.914
I'd love to come...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.434
but it's impossible
to get Wilfred to go anywhere.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.317
Forget Wilfred.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.349
Why don't you invite Paul
to stay on for dinner?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.635
And let him drive you into town afterwards.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.756
- Yes, why don't you?
- I do.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.394
I stay.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.919
Ettie, dear, how did you find
your new home?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.309
I happened on it district visiting.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.794
Come, darling.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.757
Queen Elizabeth stayed there one night.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.832
It's right on the river,
in the midst of the sweetest slums.

23:13.920 --> 23:18.072
So individual: Murderer's dens
on one side, pubs on the other.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.915
Is your party buffet or sit-down?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.275
Buffet. The house is too small for sit-down.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.839
How I loathe buffets.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.433
Last week at Eva Trippet's...

23:26.520 --> 23:28.909
I sat on a plate of salad, and no one told me.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.718
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.233
Dr. Yogami.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.032
How do you do?

23:41.240 --> 23:43.151
Is Dr. Glendon at home?

23:43.360 --> 23:46.955
My husband is working on
an experiment. He can't see anyone.

23:47.040 --> 23:50.032
- Perhaps I can see him later?
- I'm afraid not.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.188
Lisa, who is this interesting-looking man?

23:53.280 --> 23:54.838
Introduce him to me at once.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.956
Dr. Yogami, my aunt, Miss Coombes.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.673
- How do you do?
- I noticed you...

23:58.760 --> 24:01.479
at the botanical garden party
and wondered who you were.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.312
You must come to my party tonight.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.313
Just a free and easy musical
at my little bandbox in the slums.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.876
Thank you, but I'm
far too busy a man for pleasure.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.236
Nonsense. Very busy men
come to my parties.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.833
Positively the busiest.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.672
Lady Forsythe is bringing her son.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.671
Could you find a busier man in all London...

24:19.760 --> 24:21.079
than the Chief of Scotland Yard?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.037
Time to scuttle, Ettie.

24:23.120 --> 24:26.112
I must go. I'll see you tonight, Dr. Yokohama.

24:58.160 --> 25:02.711
Dr. Yogami, didn't they tell you
that I wasn't seeing anyone today?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.309
I thought, perhaps, you might see me.

25:06.400 --> 25:10.029
- Come another day, please.
- Another day would be too late.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.400
What will happen before morning,
I cannot say.

25:14.200 --> 25:17.715
Tonight is the first night of the full moon.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.077
Still harping on that old wives' tale of yours?

25:21.480 --> 25:23.869
Would it were an old wives' tale.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.675
Exactly what do you want of me?

25:32.040 --> 25:36.079
Two blossoms of the <i>Mariphasa</i> flower
in there...

25:36.680 --> 25:40.229
- would save two souls tonight.
- Tonight?

25:41.160 --> 25:43.549
But I thought you said
the <i>Mariphasa</i> was a cure.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.835
No. An antidote.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.955
Effective only for a few hours.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.793
Won't you let me see
the results of your experiment?

25:53.880 --> 25:56.348
Sorry. When my experiments are completed...

25:56.440 --> 25:58.908
I will show the results to the entire worid.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.359
Not before.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.238
Now, sir, I must wish you good day.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.830
DR. YOGAMl: Then there is nothing more
to be said?

26:06.920 --> 26:08.148
Nothing.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.714
Good day.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.269
But remember this, Dr. Glendon.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.355
The werewolf instinctively seeks to kill...

26:19.440 --> 26:21.396
the thing it loves best.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.308
Come in.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.677
We're leaving now, Wilfred.
We?

27:46.760 --> 27:48.034
I know it's a little early...

27:48.120 --> 27:51.112
but Paul wants to stop at his flat and change.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.428
Had you planned on getting home?

27:55.520 --> 27:58.876
Naturally, I shall get Lee back.
Yes, of course. Thank you.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.072
Darling, won't you change your mind
and come with us?

28:03.280 --> 28:05.350
I listened
to all the childhood memories...

28:05.440 --> 28:07.590
I care to hear for one night.

28:08.640 --> 28:12.155
Run along, dear.
Run along and enjoy yourself.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.311
I want you to see what I've done
with that brocade you brought me.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.198
Put off those beastly lights, I tell you!

28:19.280 --> 28:22.352
Wilfred, what on earth's the matter?

28:24.240 --> 28:28.028
Sorry, darling. I've been putting
some medicine in my eyes...

28:28.120 --> 28:30.680
and the lights hurt them.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.154
I just wanted you to see my coat.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.476
Some other time, please.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.550
Good night, Wilfred.
Good night.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.074
Good night, Dr. Glendon.
Good night, sir.

28:44.480 --> 28:45.469
Lisa.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.468
Good night, my darling.

31:50.600 --> 31:54.513
<i>Scenes that are brightest</i>

31:55.280 --> 31:58.750
<i>May charm</i>

31:58.920 --> 32:03.072
<i>awhile</i>

32:03.360 --> 32:08.275
<i>Hearts which are brightest</i>

32:08.960 --> 32:13.829
<i>And eyes that smile</i>

32:13.920 --> 32:15.956
Lisa! Get off my train!

32:17.080 --> 32:19.071
I hate it when I step on a train.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.071
I shall take you home in a minute.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.720
- Alice, my dear.
- Oh, my dear.

32:23.800 --> 32:27.031
How amazing of you
to succeed in bringing your son.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.231
She's singing <i>Scenes That Are Brightest.</i>

32:29.320 --> 32:31.550
She sings Botticelli divinely.

32:31.960 --> 32:35.669
One doesn't sing Botticelli. One paints him.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.309
Oh, yes. I forgot for the moment.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.949
Lisa, dear. Charming. Paul, so good of you.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.239
You two deep men should know each other.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.552
Col. Forsythe, this is Dr. Yokohama.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.509
We've met somewhere.

32:55.920 --> 32:56.989
Yes.

33:04.720 --> 33:08.679
Don't you just love moonlight,
Dr. Yokohama?

33:09.520 --> 33:12.034
Makes everything so peaceful.

33:12.640 --> 33:17.077
Isn't it romantic to have the Thames
lapping at your very threshold?

33:17.800 --> 33:21.076
Sings me to sleep every night, positively.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.112
That's the worst district in London
over there.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.351
Knife you for a shilling, positively.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.917
But what difference?

33:31.280 --> 33:34.477
I always say, everything is fate.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.991
Don't you agree with me?

33:47.520 --> 33:48.953
What's that?

33:50.200 --> 33:52.156
A lost soul perhaps.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.039
Let's go in.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.228
What is it, Hugh?

34:12.320 --> 34:14.514
Just a dog, out for a little or no good.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.034
It isn't a dog. It's a lost soul.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.632
I think we'd better
get her upstairs, don't you?

34:23.960 --> 34:26.155
My aunt is feeling a little ill, Dr. Yogami.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.196
You know, you're a naughty girl.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.467
Ettie Coombes, what's the matter with you?

34:32.080 --> 34:34.116
One shouldn't drink at one's own parties.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.634
But I get so nervous.

34:38.639 --> 34:41.279
Ettie Coombes, you should
go on the water wagon.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.157
Now, you come along to bed.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.917
Don't worry. You'll be
perfectly all right in the morning.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.679
I'm so nervous. I want to lie down.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.909
Nothing to be nervous of.
Here we are.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.797
Get to bed. You'll be okay in the morning.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.314
I've been so frightened.
Open the window.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.868
Yes, of course I will. Air will do her good.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.315
Do you know she's nearly asleep now?

35:08.400 --> 35:10.072
Come on. Let's go.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.439
What's that horrible sound? What is it?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.997
Well, if I were back on the ranch...

35:26.080 --> 35:28.878
I'd say it was a coyote with a bad dream.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.589
But in London, I don't know.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.676
Can't tell me that's a dog.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.720
You are quite right. It isn't a dog.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.236
I say, you're trembling.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.873
All right, I'll go.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.951
Don't go up there, Mrs. Glendon.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.151
Don't let any of the women come upstairs.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.276
Just a moment. If you'll all stand back.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.477
What's the matter in here?

36:43.080 --> 36:44.229
What's wrong?

36:44.320 --> 36:47.551
The devil's been here. He had green eyes.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.112
He clawed at me. He was covered with hair.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.794
There, there. You've had
a bad nightmare, that's all.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.996
If anyone dares to tell me
I've been dreaming...

36:56.080 --> 36:57.638
I shan't answer for the consequences.

36:57.720 --> 36:58.948
Nobody will.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.155
Come along.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.435
<i>You'll be much better if you sit down.</i>

37:02.720 --> 37:05.314
You sit down here. You'll be all right.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.472
My wicked woridliness
has caught up with me at last.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.028
The Babu of Goroka always said it would.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.236
There. Never mind.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.991
I'm not here in my official capacity...

37:17.080 --> 37:18.991
but I think I can say with conviction...

37:19.080 --> 37:22.072
that no devil or any man has come
through this window tonight.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.799
Yes. I think our hostess
has been mixing her drinks.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.518
That's a very excellent deduction.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.716
A horrible feeling. I've been like it myself.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.869
We all do it at times.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.269
It's getting quite late.
The party must be over.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.475
Shall we have one before we go?

37:33.560 --> 37:34.549
I'll have one.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.437
- Lee, I'll wait for you.
- All right.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.431
Can I drop you anywhere?

38:35.360 --> 38:38.397
- Anything else, sir?
- Nothing.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.153
This flower looks to have
slipped off and died on its own.

38:41.240 --> 38:44.198
Whatever is it, sir?
I've never seen nothing like it.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.351
Let that flower alone!

38:55.080 --> 38:56.877
I meant no harm, sir.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.475
It's only that I'm so fond of flowers...

38:59.560 --> 39:02.074
my fingers always want to touch them.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.672
I'm sorry, Millie.

39:04.880 --> 39:08.953
Here. Take these and buy yourself
a pot of primroses or something.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.189
Thank you, sir.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.391
Go on, Jenkins. You heard the cries...

39:12.480 --> 39:14.755
and you ran in the direction
from which they came.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.752
Yes, sir. And bloodcurdling they was.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.075
I took off as fast as anybody could...

39:20.160 --> 39:22.515
that was suffering from broken arches.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.239
Broken arches acquired
in the line of duty, sir.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.794
It was some minutes
before you located the fatality?

39:28.880 --> 39:30.711
Good morning. I'm a little early.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.552
No. Did you see the papers?
No.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.073
Just read this.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.593
Go on, Jenkins.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.036
At Goose Lane, me arches crack,
and I come a cropper.

39:39.120 --> 39:42.556
- Go on.
- Then I see what I see.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.316
My stomach takes such a turn,
my arches crack again.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.873
Goose Lane.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.840
This thing must have happened
near Miss Ettie's house.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.273
Yes, quite near.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.351
There were wounds on the girl's throat...

39:54.440 --> 39:56.317
a wild animal might have made.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.513
Well, if that wasn't a wolf I heard
baying last night, I'm crazy.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.832
You know, our dear Aunt Ettie...

40:02.920 --> 40:05.673
may not have mixed her drinks
as badly as we thought.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.079
In view of this occurrence...

40:07.160 --> 40:10.072
I'm inclined to wonder myself
whether there's any connection.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.470
But whatever Miss Coombes saw,
it wasn't a wolf.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.869
No. Not in London. You may be sure of that.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.359
I see I can't help you.

40:17.440 --> 40:20.113
But I've only one other
brilliant suggestion to make.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.553
How about a werewolf then?

40:21.640 --> 40:24.950
This is Scotland Yard, my boy,
not <i>Grimm's Fairy Tales.</i>

40:25.320 --> 40:28.915
"There are more things in heaven
and Earth, Horatio." You know.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.192
It's a funny thing. When I was
flying in Yucatán last year...

40:32.280 --> 40:34.714
- the authorities went cuckoo over...
- Who?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.479
I beg your pardon, sir.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.915
I mean, the authorities
were gravely concerned...

40:39.000 --> 40:41.070
with a series of murders,
not unlike this one...

40:41.160 --> 40:44.630
and they were always preceded
by the howling of a wolf.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.597
And then one night...

40:47.200 --> 40:50.078
they shot something
slinking through the hills...

40:50.480 --> 40:52.391
and the murders ceased.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.680
- They said it was a werewolf.
- Who were they?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.273
All right.

40:57.440 --> 41:00.557
But if any more of your citizens
are found stark and cold...

41:01.040 --> 41:03.270
just remember, nephew warned you.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.714
I think I might be able to persuade
Wilfred to go, too. Yes.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.598
Anyhow I'll expect you, Paul.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.557
Dinner at 8:00. Goodbye.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.193
Good morning, Wilfred.
Good morning, dear.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.072
I've just been talking to Paul.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.072
He suggests that we all go
for a moonlight ride tonight.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.991
I'm sorry. I can't go.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.432
There's something wrong, darling.
Very, very wrong.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.232
Why do you say that?

41:46.320 --> 41:47.958
Won't you tell me what it is?

41:48.040 --> 41:50.952
Nothing. I shall be all right.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.755
I wish we could burn
that wretched laboratory...

41:53.840 --> 41:55.239
and everything in it.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.992
Darling, you're not happy.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.310
I know when you used to work...

41:59.400 --> 42:01.470
you were single-tracked and absorbed.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.869
But you were thrilled, excited.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.798
Now something about you frightens me.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.030
Lisa, you mustn't say such things.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.759
You're short-tempered with me now.
You never used to be.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.308
You seem to have found
someone sufficiently pleasant...

42:14.400 --> 42:15.753
to make up for it.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.235
You're being utterly hateful.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.719
I'm sorry.

42:24.720 --> 42:27.393
Just bear with me a little while longer.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.355
You really want me
to go on that ride tonight?

42:30.440 --> 42:33.796
- If you only knew how much.
- All right, then. I'll go.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.957
I do love you, Lisa.
You know that, don't you?

42:51.320 --> 42:53.276
Hawkins.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.751
Yes, sir. Coming, sir.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.637
You called, sir?

43:01.920 --> 43:04.036
Hawkins, I've got to get away for tonight.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.509
I want you to watch over things
very carefully.

43:06.600 --> 43:09.194
Yes, sir. I promise you,
no more flowers will be stolen.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.396
That I can and will promise you, sir.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.437
But this bud, sir.

43:13.720 --> 43:16.792
The moon lamp, it don't seem
to bring it out, does it?

43:16.920 --> 43:17.955
No.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.797
Well, sir, the real moon will be out
in a couple of hours.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.348
Maybe that'll bring it out all right, sir.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.635
That'll be too late, Hawkins.

43:28.360 --> 43:30.078
That'll be too late.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.197
I want you to keep
the moon ray going.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.236
Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.877
Wilfred, we'll have to hurry...

43:43.960 --> 43:46.713
if we want to see the moon
rise over the Downs.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.199
I can't go.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.757
I've to go down to Leicestershire
for a few days to see Bransby.

43:51.840 --> 43:53.353
I'm sorry, sir.

43:53.440 --> 43:56.716
I've just had a wire from him about
a shipment of bulbs from Burma.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.234
Can't you put it off until tomorrow,
and ride tonight?

43:59.320 --> 44:02.153
I can't. And you're not to go riding, either.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.229
What?

44:03.320 --> 44:05.151
- I forbid it, do you hear?
- Forbid it?

44:05.240 --> 44:07.708
I can't have my wife
gallivanting around the country...

44:07.800 --> 44:09.472
in the moonlight, with a total stranger.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.834
Hardly that, Dr. Glendon.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.480
I planned to ride, Wilfred,
and I intend to ride.

44:13.560 --> 44:16.028
Very well. If you must...

44:17.360 --> 44:21.990
then promise me that you'll get back
before the moon rises.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.229
Promise me that.

44:23.320 --> 44:25.151
I'll promise you nothing of the sort.

44:25.240 --> 44:28.277
I shall ride tonight,
tomorrow night, the next night...

44:28.400 --> 44:31.437
in fact, every night there's a moon.
Come, Paul.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.156
Don't go.
Of course I'm going.

44:46.560 --> 44:50.439
- Here's to you, Mrs. Moncaster.
- And here's to you, Mrs. Whack.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.475
That's the first I've had today.

45:00.760 --> 45:03.877
- How's your son, dearie?
- He's doing splendid.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.152
Did I tell you he was a foreman
in a pants factory?

45:07.240 --> 45:08.468
- No.
- Yes.

45:08.560 --> 45:11.836
And the warden says he's
the best prisoner he's ever had...

45:11.920 --> 45:13.069
in the penitentiary.

45:13.160 --> 45:16.311
I always knew that boy
would amount to something.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.840
Is your tripe tough, Mrs. Moncaster?

45:21.920 --> 45:24.229
- Not at all.
- Mine is.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.918
It ain't tripe you're eating. It's your veil.

45:29.640 --> 45:30.914
Oh, Lord.

45:32.200 --> 45:34.668
I want two gins for two ladies.

45:34.840 --> 45:36.478
Two ladies?

45:36.800 --> 45:38.119
Where's the other lady?

45:38.200 --> 45:40.839
Man, what's the matter with your sight?

45:41.440 --> 45:43.271
I'm the both of them.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.433
I beg your pardon.

45:49.520 --> 45:52.956
Could you tell me of anyone in this
neighbourhood with rooms to let?

45:53.040 --> 45:54.837
Try Mrs. Moncaster in there...

45:54.920 --> 45:57.354
the lady with the feathers,
eating the plate of tripe.

45:57.440 --> 46:00.910
- Thank you.
- He seems to have a secret sorrow.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.877
Which one of you ladies has rooms?

46:05.960 --> 46:08.428
I have. And most reasonable.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.636
Three shillings a week for a gentleman.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.551
And the rooms is splendid.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.438
Don't you pay attention
to the lying old hypocrite, sir.

46:15.520 --> 46:17.192
Now, my rooms is...

46:20.360 --> 46:23.636
That's my dearest friend, Mrs. Whack.

46:23.840 --> 46:26.593
But she don't understand
the ethics of business.

46:26.880 --> 46:30.839
Now, are your intentions
by the night or by the week?

46:30.960 --> 46:33.713
- I'll take the room by the week.
- Then this way, sir.

46:33.800 --> 46:37.395
It's just across the court.
Right here. This way.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.198
If you'll follow me, sir.

46:39.920 --> 46:43.037
It's going to be a fine night after all.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.596
I do hate taking my plumes out in the wet.

46:46.800 --> 46:49.439
Are you a single gentleman, sir?

46:49.520 --> 46:51.192
Singularly single, madam.

46:51.560 --> 46:55.155
More single than I ever realised
is possible for a human being to be.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.753
You don't say.

46:57.240 --> 47:00.710
What would you say, if I were
to tell you that it was possible...

47:00.800 --> 47:03.268
for a man to turn into a werewolf?

47:03.640 --> 47:07.155
I'd say I was Little Red Riding Hood.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.958
There's my gilt and splendid parlour, sir.

47:13.760 --> 47:16.354
You're single, and I'm single.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.271
Ain't that a coincidence?

47:18.560 --> 47:22.189
Ten years I was married to
Moncaster. Ain't seen him in 20.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.998
He run away to Australia.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.511
What a man he was.

47:26.720 --> 47:29.473
Used to come home from his work
all portered up...

47:29.560 --> 47:32.597
hit the baby with the plate,
throw the gravy in the grate...

47:32.680 --> 47:34.477
spear the canary with a fork.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.676
And with his heavy
hobnail boots...

47:36.760 --> 47:38.432
black-and-blue me from head to foot...

47:38.520 --> 47:41.239
and all because I forgot
to have crackling on the pork.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.197
Here's your room, sir.

47:49.880 --> 47:52.075
Don't let this happen to me.

47:57.560 --> 48:01.633
Father in Heaven,
don't let this happen to me again.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.678
If it must happen, keep me here.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.591
Keep me away from Lisa.

48:24.520 --> 48:26.988
Keep me away from the thing I love.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.633
Mrs. Moncaster.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.472
Oh, you poor dear.

49:21.760 --> 49:23.796
I'm sorry I hit you, Mrs. Whack.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.639
Say no more about that, Mrs. Moncaster.

49:26.720 --> 49:28.551
What's going on here?

49:29.160 --> 49:32.357
He grips me, swipes me,
swats me one in the breadbasket...

49:32.440 --> 49:35.477
and slams the door in me face.
Do you call that a gentleman?

49:35.560 --> 49:39.030
I thought perhaps you might want
some help. That's why I come in.

49:39.240 --> 49:42.869
Strange noises have been coming
from his room, Mrs. Whack.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.793
I don't know what I've let myself in for.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.912
I'd use me passkey and have a look.

50:01.560 --> 50:03.835
Take a peek through the keyhole first.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.198
Where have you been?

50:33.480 --> 50:36.836
I've been waiting more than
15 minutes for you to open the gate.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.514
Them wolves have been
acting queerly all night.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.834
Hear them?
Wolves is nothing to me.

50:43.080 --> 50:44.718
Give me a nice kiss, Alf.

50:54.720 --> 50:56.756
I hadn't ought to do this.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.356
Me with a wife and kids.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.477
But you don't love your wife
and your kids. You love me.

51:25.160 --> 51:28.391
Them blasted wolves.
What's the matter with them tonight?

51:28.480 --> 51:30.232
What a fool you are.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.796
A young fellow like you...

51:32.880 --> 51:36.395
tied to a white-faced, whimpering,
scarecrow of a woman.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.753
But you're going to leave her
and come with me, ain't you?

51:42.440 --> 51:43.589
Maybe.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.797
Wait a minute.
I've got to see what's happening.

52:17.480 --> 52:21.359
Why, Mrs. Whack,
what keeps you up so late?

52:21.440 --> 52:23.431
I felt I couldn't go to bed, ángel...

52:23.520 --> 52:25.670
without coming back to see how you was.

52:25.760 --> 52:28.035
I ain't exactly bubbling.

52:28.360 --> 52:31.033
- Is he back?
- Vanished as if he was air.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.436
He must have been a hairy man.

52:37.600 --> 52:40.512
I suppose you don't happen to have
a nip about you anywhere.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.636
No. Ain't it unfortunate?

52:45.240 --> 52:46.593
He's back.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.630
How did he get in?
I been sitting here all night.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.833
Better go up and see what he's about now.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.758
Put your eye to the keyhole.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.434
And you keep off my jaw, Mrs. Whack.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.919
Why, Mrs...

53:10.520 --> 53:11.589
Mrs. Whack.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.716
What is it?
Come here.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.389
Look.

53:20.760 --> 53:23.433
Pull yourself together. Come on.

53:24.120 --> 53:27.715
I wonder if you saw
what I saw...

53:27.800 --> 53:30.109
or if I saw what you saw.

53:30.960 --> 53:32.871
And I better run for the police.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.953
No. We've seen something
better left unsaid to the police.

53:37.200 --> 53:40.237
- They might say we've been drinking.
- Maybe we have.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.914
By any chance, did you find a bottle?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.399
No, my love.

53:46.720 --> 53:49.678
But if I saw what I thought I saw...

53:49.760 --> 53:51.716
I've had my last bottle.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.996
And it had better be the same with you.

53:54.080 --> 53:57.436
Now, I'm speaking to you
as a sister to a sister.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.150
That's right. Now, that's...

54:06.160 --> 54:07.798
Let's get inside.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.439
Shut it out.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.549
Sorry, Tom.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.949
Nice doings at the zoo.
What does <i>The Herald</i> say?

54:20.040 --> 54:22.349
Usual thing: "What's the matter
with Scotland Yard?"

54:22.440 --> 54:25.477
What do the papers think we are?
The eyes that see all?

54:26.000 --> 54:29.310
Old Forsythe's bobbing up and down
like a balloon that can't land.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.833
And, Evans.
Yes, sir.

54:30.920 --> 54:34.674
If I don't get a definite report on
both these atrocities by 6:00 p. M...

54:34.760 --> 54:38.230
I promise you, you'll all be seeking
new professions by tomorrow morning.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.912
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.151
Uncle, this is Dr. Yogami
of the University of Carpathia.

55:09.240 --> 55:10.798
Sit down.
YOGAMl: Thank you.

55:10.880 --> 55:14.156
Ever since the other night,
I've been wondering where I met you.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.959
I called on you
seven years ago...

55:17.480 --> 55:20.278
to enlist the resources of Scotland Yard...

55:21.600 --> 55:25.036
for an unfortunate mortal
afflicted with lycanthrophobia.

55:25.120 --> 55:26.792
Yes. I recall it.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.108
You thought I was mad.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.316
What can we do for you now?

55:31.160 --> 55:34.197
Your department is trying
to solve two murders.

55:35.200 --> 55:38.795
There will be other murders tonight,
and tomorrow night.

55:40.800 --> 55:43.519
Also next month,
when the moon is full again...

55:43.600 --> 55:47.673
unless you realise, sir, there is
a werewolf abroad in London.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.434
Yes, my nephew has similar ideas.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.916
What do you want us
to do about it?

55:53.000 --> 55:57.471
You must seize the only specimen
of the <i>Mariphasa</i> plant in England.

55:57.640 --> 56:00.234
And where shall I get this posy?

56:00.800 --> 56:04.236
In the private laboratory
of Dr. Wilfred Glendon.

56:05.880 --> 56:10.635
That flower is the
only known antidote for werewolfery.

56:10.920 --> 56:13.480
Yes, a very interesting folktale...

56:13.640 --> 56:15.915
but of no value to the police.

56:16.360 --> 56:17.998
I warn you, sir...

56:18.520 --> 56:20.795
unless you secure this plant...

56:21.400 --> 56:25.029
and discover the secret
of nurturing it in this country...

56:25.800 --> 56:27.552
there'll be an epidemic...

56:27.640 --> 56:30.234
that will turn London into a shambles.

56:30.960 --> 56:33.554
We'll take precautions
for the protection of London.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.837
There is a wolf wandering about,
but not the supernatural one.

56:36.920 --> 56:39.559
That, I think,
disposes of our murders.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.069
But that wolf escaped last night.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.236
That wolf will be captured.

56:45.320 --> 56:48.517
But the murder in Goose Lane
was two nights ago.

56:48.840 --> 56:51.673
Do not worry about the animal from the zoo.

56:52.680 --> 56:56.673
Whether you catch it or not,
will not matter much...

56:58.840 --> 57:00.114
tonight.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.633
Why, sir, you give me quite a start, sir.

57:16.880 --> 57:19.952
That one bud, sir, it seems rather stubborn.

57:20.720 --> 57:23.109
It doesn't seem to want to come out,
does it, sir?

57:24.200 --> 57:26.191
I'm afraid it's no use, Hawkins.

57:26.560 --> 57:28.869
It will only need another night.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.399
Another night?

57:41.560 --> 57:42.913
Why, sir...

57:43.560 --> 57:46.597
you look as if it was
a matter of life and death, sir.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.149
Perhaps we can speed it up, sir.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.550
At least we can try, can't we?

57:53.840 --> 57:56.832
- You never fail me, do you, Hawkins?
- No, sir.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.113
Listen. I haven't been here.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.993
- You haven't seen me.
- Why, of course not, sir.

58:04.080 --> 58:06.469
I've got to get away. Immediately.

58:06.840 --> 58:08.512
I can't stay here.

58:08.720 --> 58:11.757
I can't stay here
with this stubborn <i>Mariphasa.</i>

58:32.640 --> 58:35.438
Why, Mr. Glendon,
whatever brings you here?

58:35.520 --> 58:38.114
- I'm spending the night here.
- I am glad, sir.

58:38.200 --> 58:41.351
And my wife will be happy to cook
one more supper for you, sir.

58:41.440 --> 58:44.512
I don't want anyone to know that
I'm here. Not even Mrs. Timothy.

58:44.600 --> 58:47.398
I want to be alone. I want to
get away from Glendon Manor...

58:47.480 --> 58:51.234
away from my work, away from people.
I want to be alone and think.

58:51.320 --> 58:54.756
You've often wanted to be alone
and think, haven't you, Timothy?

58:54.840 --> 58:58.719
Yes, sir, but Mrs. Timothy
will be awful disappointed, sir.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.474
You know, she's always talking
about the old days...

59:01.560 --> 59:04.233
when Miss Lisa's mother and father
was alive...

59:04.320 --> 59:06.515
and you would come courting here.

59:07.240 --> 59:10.073
Hello, old fellow.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.958
You remember me, don't you?

59:12.160 --> 59:14.196
He seems glad to see me, Timothy.

59:14.280 --> 59:17.397
Yes. Beans remembers the old days, too, sir.

59:17.480 --> 59:19.596
Do you know
where I'm going to spend the night?

59:19.680 --> 59:22.717
I was thinking of airing out
the best room in the west wing, sir.

59:22.800 --> 59:25.712
No, don't do that.
I'm going to the Monk's Rest.

59:26.080 --> 59:29.516
You can't do that, sir.
Why, it ain't been open for years.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.478
Nevertheless, that's where I'm going
to spend the night.

59:32.560 --> 59:37.031
You see, Miss Lisa and I,
we miss the old times, too.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.558
Thank you, Timothy.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.474
Why, there ain't even a bed, sir.

59:49.760 --> 59:51.318
I shan't need a bed, Timothy.

59:51.400 --> 59:54.915
- You'll be cold, I'm afraid, sir.
- If I am, I shall build a fire.

59:56.840 --> 59:58.592
Here's the key, sir.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.114
- Lock me in, Timothy.
- Pardon, sir?

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.670
Lock me in. Don't open that door
before sunrise.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.194
Even if I call, pay no attention to it.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.635
Keep that door locked till dawn.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.519
Good night.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.679
Good night, sir.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.596
There it is, Paul. You can
just see it through the trees.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.472
Dear old Falden.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.719
I couldn't go back to America
without one look at it.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.677
Let's get out of the car here and walk.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.795
All right.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.396
Lee, I can't tell you how strange
it seems coming back here...

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.152
after all these years.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.913
This is where we used to hunt
for birds' eggs. Remember?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.151
And this is where I proposed to you.
Do you remember that?

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.873
And then a bumblebee stung you.
How funny you looked.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.794
My dear, I can't tell you how good
it is to hear you laugh again.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.674
Lee, I love you so much.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.749
Always have, always will.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.879
Don't say that, Paul.
You promised you wouldn't.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.952
We've been through it all before. It's no use.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.996
But you're horribly, miserably unhappy.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.638
Anyone can see that.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.154
It's you who are making me unhappy, Paul.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.875
Couldn't you care for me again?

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.595
I wouldn't tell you if I could.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.596
I don't know why, Lee...

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.508
but I'm frightened for you.
Terribly frightened.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.113
Don't be silly.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.957
I can still beat you to the Monk's Tower.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.395
It's on. I'll give you
a 10-yard start. Off you go.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.233
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.039
I've won!

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.391
So you've seen this monster before?

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.313
Yes. There was something
grotesquely familiar about it.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.392
Then it suddenly struck me.
It was Wilfred Glendon.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.277
Paul, pull yourself together.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.590
Do you realise
what you're accusing Glendon of?

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.432
A man I've known all his life.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.149
I repeat, sir. I fought
with Wilfred Glendon, a werewolf.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.473
Where is Mrs. Glendon now?

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.472
At home, doors and windows locked.
Miss Coombes is with her.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.915
They promised not to leave
the room until I got back.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.037
Very well. I'll go to Glendon Manor
in my official capacity.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.759
But I'm going to form my own conclusions...

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.671
- from what I see and hear.
- All right.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.070
We've just found another victim
of this monstrous murderer:

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.991
A chambermaid at the Bedlington Hotel...

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.594
- killed some time last night.
- Very well. I'll be over.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.955
There you are. There's your werewolf for you.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.758
Unless it had seven-league boots...

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.876
it couldn't get to the Bedlington Hotel...

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.110
150 miles from Falden Abbey.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.316
I'll tell you what. We'll go to the hotel...

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.039
and after that, if necessary,
we'll go to Glendon Manor.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.235
I think it'll be necessary.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.789
Usual thing. The place smelled
like a kennel when we came in.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.154
You can still notice it.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.468
Who occupied the room?

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.438
The guest's name was a Dr. Yogami, sir.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.232
The same kind of lacerations?
Exactly, sir.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.589
Yeah.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.675
Look, sir. I just found these
in the wastepaper basket.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.435
I've never seen
a flower like it before, have you?

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.589
No.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.469
Yogami spoke of some rare plant
that Glendon had.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.949
This must be it.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.951
Buck up, my boy. You're not such a fool.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.076
We'll drive down to Glendon Manor at once.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.309
Right. I'll get my hat.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.956
Dr. Glendon is not at home, sir.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.474
- Was he here last night?
- I think not, sir.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.793
Have you heard from Dr. Glendon?

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.598
No, we haven't heard a word from him.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.948
Has Hawkins seen him?

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.598
No. He is not in the laboratory.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.195
- Are you all right, Lisa?
- Yes. Don't worry.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.474
Keep your door locked.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.113
No report from the East End, sir.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.031
No report from Yogami's apartment, sir.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.519
We've heard nothing of Dr. Yogami.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.919
Three men at Glendon's. Yes.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.838
No, we're not afraid.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.395
Glendon has not passed through Richmond.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.391
Headquarters. No station reports
any trace of Dr. Glendon.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.913
- Dr. Glendon!
- Quiet. Help me up.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.309
The police have been searching
everywhere for you.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.278
I know. The <i>Mariphasa,</i> has it bloomed yet?

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.679
No, but it's going to bloom.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.035
That'll be all.
You needn't mention you've seen me.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.473
No, sir. Of course not.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.158
Yogami! You brought this on me...

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.357
that night in Tibet.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.599
I'm sorry I can't share this with you.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.878
Relax, Lisa. Relax.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.628
Quick. Col. Forsythe.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.388
Col. Forsythe has left
for Glendon Manor, madam.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.109
It's Lisa. Don't you know me?

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.314
Wilfred!

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.511
Thanks for the bullet.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.272
It was the only way.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.909
In a few moments now...

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.669
I shall know why all of this had to be.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.831
<i>Lisa, goodbye.</i>

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.838
Goodbye, Lisa.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.279
I'm sorry...

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.872
I couldn't have made you happier.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.830
In my report, I shall say...

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.550
that I shot him by accident...

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.553
while he was trying to protect his wife.
