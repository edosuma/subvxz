00:03.289 --> 00:05.944
- You made me go mad.
- You're making me mad now.

00:05.990 --> 00:07.624
- We are Cook and Effy.
- We've never met.

00:08.277 --> 00:09.673
I'm not scared.

00:09.708 --> 00:10.646
You're no good
for me, Cook.

00:10.707 --> 00:12.629
I need John.
He'll make me better.

00:12.776 --> 00:14.532
- You're John Foster.
- And you must be Freddie.

00:14.533 --> 00:16.058
Can't let you have her,
I'm afraid.

00:16.101 --> 00:17.623
She really does love you,
you know.

# Thought it was a nightmare #

01:39.601 --> 01:42.211
# Lo, it's all so true, #

01:43.397 --> 01:46.432
# They told me,
"Don't go walkin' slow" #

01:46.532 --> 01:49.100
# "'Cause Devil's on the loose." #

01:49.803 --> 01:52.192
# Better run through the jungle #

01:53.214 --> 01:55.732
# Better run through the jungle #

01:56.877 --> 01:59.275
# Better run through the jungle #

02:00.460 --> 02:03.224
# Woah, don't look
back to see. #

02:04.434 --> 02:07.143
# Thought I heard a rumblin' #

02:07.825 --> 02:10.213
# Callin' to my name #

02:11.499 --> 02:14.702
# Two hundred million guns
are loaded #

02:14.782 --> 02:17.212
# Satan cries, "Take aim!" #

02:17.543 --> 02:20.473
# Better run through the jungle #

02:21.215 --> 02:23.956
# Better run through the jungle #

02:24.891 --> 02:27.401
# Better run through the jungle #

02:28.426 --> 02:31.251
# Woah, don't look
back to see #

03:01.285 --> 03:03.786
# Over on the mountain #

03:03.936 --> 03:06.633
# Thunder magic spoke #

03:07.897 --> 03:11.189
# "Let the people know
my wisdom" #

03:11.440 --> 03:13.605
# "Fill the land with smoke" #

03:14.163 --> 03:16.665
# Better run through the jungle #

03:17.448 --> 03:20.094
# Better run through the jungle #

03:21.056 --> 03:23.313
# Better run through the jungle #

03:23.374 --> 03:24.187
Three.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.688
- # Woah, don't look back to see #
- Four. Shit.

03:28.170 --> 03:30.595
Come on, get up!
Five...

03:30.797 --> 03:31.623
Come on!

04:20.329 --> 04:21.245
Freds?

04:25.027 --> 04:26.593
I'm wearing your best tee.

04:57.239 --> 04:58.132
Anything?

04:59.941 --> 05:01.497
Only in my head.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.867
He's talking in my head.

05:04.681 --> 05:06.421
What's our Fred saying?

05:07.859 --> 05:09.742
He's saying
they're all fucking mad.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.517
Two, three and... go!

05:11.678 --> 05:13.150
Yup.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.357
Where's Panda gone?

05:20.234 --> 05:21.357
What's she doing?

05:24.665 --> 05:26.144
Oh my God!

05:31.851 --> 05:33.563
You're going the wrong way!

05:36.153 --> 05:38.382
Go, Panda.
They're all after you.

05:39.727 --> 05:41.402
Bounce to me!

05:54.489 --> 05:56.910
Ems! I'm back!

05:57.052 --> 05:57.851
No!

05:58.965 --> 06:00.723
Oh my God.
Oh my God. Oh, shit.

06:02.164 --> 06:02.922
Hi.

06:03.922 --> 06:05.288
I got eggs.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.090
We can have eggs, yeah?

06:07.460 --> 06:10.684
And Red Bulls
and pain au chocolat and...

06:11.480 --> 06:15.048
I got the heat.
What?

06:21.160 --> 06:22.874
She'd been snoring
like that all night.

06:23.084 --> 06:23.706
What?

06:23.707 --> 06:25.758
You were both
so fucking trashed.

06:26.202 --> 06:28.275
So I slept in the sofa
with Panda.

06:29.818 --> 06:30.694
Right.

06:31.251 --> 06:32.433
She's quite cute.

06:33.980 --> 06:35.018
For a straight girl.

06:39.010 --> 06:41.301
Wow. In the scud.

06:42.225 --> 06:44.610
- When did that happen?
- I didn't notice.

06:44.807 --> 06:46.742
Good thing. You might have got
you know...

06:47.587 --> 06:48.573
Tempted...

06:50.258 --> 06:51.339
I was wrecked.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.347
Yeah.
You were both pissing corn.

06:55.881 --> 06:57.205
Like I said, cute.

06:59.721 --> 07:00.839
Is this bad?

07:03.813 --> 07:04.836
You all need your breakfast?

07:05.334 --> 07:07.738
I can fry you,
poach you, scramble you.

07:09.406 --> 07:10.714
Do you any way you like.

07:11.603 --> 07:13.669
But shower though,
cause, Ems...

07:13.914 --> 07:16.092
You smell of something
and it ain't roses.

07:27.994 --> 07:30.156
Couldn't you have just brought me
some grapes or something?

07:30.246 --> 07:32.311
Grapes are for chipmunks.
This is so better.

07:33.179 --> 07:35.322
I wrote you a song,
I just can't get the hang of...

07:35.357 --> 07:37.899
Tit and piss,
the instructions were in Japanese!

07:38.803 --> 07:41.170
Oh, fuck me up
the arse three ways!

07:41.229 --> 07:43.414
- Come on, you nonky cunt!
- Language!

07:43.449 --> 07:46.508
Great, innit? I've been practising.
Oh, I've got it!

07:46.868 --> 07:50.975
Scrapey, scrapey for you,
shakey, shakey for you.

07:53.284 --> 07:54.177
What for?

07:54.212 --> 07:55.980
Life.
Can't stand still, can we?

07:55.981 --> 07:57.748
So this is gonna
cheer you up.

08:00.890 --> 08:03.883
# Some days are disasters #

08:03.923 --> 08:06.124
# That you wish could just end #

08:07.128 --> 08:09.511
# Other days are bastards #

08:09.551 --> 08:12.588
# Just like a bad boyfriend #

08:12.623 --> 08:15.646
# But it makes me feel
much worse than this #

08:15.681 --> 08:18.655
# To see a face masked
with a frown #

08:18.690 --> 08:23.173
# I'm not telling you to smile,
but don't be down #

08:24.231 --> 08:26.882
# Don't be down, my friend #

08:26.963 --> 08:31.044
# Don't do your wrist
any harm #

08:31.079 --> 08:35.149
# You don't belong
on a funny farm #

08:36.433 --> 08:42.514
# And I'd rather see you in a party
dress than in a hospital gown #

08:42.515 --> 08:47.464
# I'm not telling you to smile,
but don't be down #

09:05.923 --> 09:07.335
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.694
- Do, do, do, do, do, do.
- Did you write that?

09:24.237 --> 09:25.572
Oh, fuck me!

09:29.619 --> 09:31.533
Seems nice.

09:31.901 --> 09:33.294
Met her at Dojo's.

09:34.364 --> 09:36.101
Hit it off. You know.

09:37.259 --> 09:39.051
Like a whirlwind romance.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.912
Yeah, well,
we got chatting.

09:42.101 --> 09:43.175
Did you?

09:44.762 --> 09:45.493
No.

09:47.137 --> 09:49.852
Well... least
you're moving on.

09:49.892 --> 09:53.631
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm well over Eff. Finito.

09:53.856 --> 09:58.016
It's like... liberating, yeah.

09:58.220 --> 09:59.642
- Good.
- Moving on.

10:00.786 --> 10:02.713
I'm looking
forward to meeting...

10:03.751 --> 10:07.123
Phew, fucking hell! I'm never
having the mezze platter again.

10:07.515 --> 10:09.382
I opened the window a bit,
you know.

10:10.966 --> 10:12.341
Naomi, Arcia.

10:13.823 --> 10:14.629
- Pardon?
- Arcia.

10:14.955 --> 10:17.261
Sorry, I didn't quite...

10:17.296 --> 10:18.310
Arcia.

10:19.109 --> 10:20.030
Arcia?!

10:20.798 --> 10:22.466
Arcia, all right?

10:22.831 --> 10:26.664
Yeah, it's fine.
Arcia, Arcia.

10:27.416 --> 10:28.651
It's pretty...

10:29.561 --> 10:31.722
- Arcia.
- Cheers.

10:31.755 --> 10:33.207
Listen, lover,

10:33.553 --> 10:36.942
I think I lost my pissing thong
in the bus station.

10:38.114 --> 10:39.752
Er, did you?

10:39.831 --> 10:42.335
You know I fucking did,
stud man!

10:42.523 --> 10:44.192
He's a little criminal.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.912
That is what they say.

10:46.013 --> 10:46.929
Yeah.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.438
I'm not going!
I'm fine here! Leave me alone!

11:06.494 --> 11:08.357
Sometimes
it's hard to move on.

11:10.729 --> 11:12.232
How are you, Elizabeth?

11:12.694 --> 11:13.491
Better.

11:14.111 --> 11:15.048
Sure?

11:16.599 --> 11:17.385
No.

11:19.351 --> 11:21.092
Your mother
wants you to go home.

11:22.152 --> 11:23.942
She says she can look
after you there.

11:25.627 --> 11:27.957
- Is that good?
- Good?

11:32.839 --> 11:34.696
You know better than that,
Elizabeth.

11:35.409 --> 11:37.283
We have to forget about
good and bad.

11:40.194 --> 11:41.670
My boyfriend ran away.

11:42.545 --> 11:43.768
That was bad.

11:45.535 --> 11:46.708
How can we know?

11:48.444 --> 11:50.218
If only we knew
how things will turn out.

11:51.958 --> 11:52.946
Yeah.

11:56.489 --> 11:59.338
I came to tell you that
I'm leaving my job here.

11:59.766 --> 12:02.590
You?
You're leaving?

12:02.834 --> 12:04.286
Don't be upset.

12:05.431 --> 12:06.432
I think...

12:07.518 --> 12:08.791
Maybe it's time.

12:10.821 --> 12:12.234
Do I say thank you?

12:13.047 --> 12:17.331
We don't know yet.
But I think...

12:18.647 --> 12:22.049
Yes, you could be something
I'm proud of.

12:22.084 --> 12:23.926
I'll never forget you.

12:30.108 --> 12:30.949
No.

12:32.643 --> 12:33.703
You won't.

12:43.786 --> 12:45.596
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

12:45.907 --> 12:47.193
Goodbye.

12:58.901 --> 13:00.669
Effy, Effy...

13:04.414 --> 13:05.717
Freds?

13:20.092 --> 13:22.334
I thought you didn't
sleep with her any more.

13:24.791 --> 13:27.875
Yeah, well,
people keep moving in.

13:29.693 --> 13:31.719
Isn't what you told me,
that's all.

13:32.161 --> 13:34.553
Mandy, we haven't done
anything.

13:34.609 --> 13:35.903
So, I don't why...

13:36.939 --> 13:38.924
I mean,
we didn't do anything last night.

13:40.948 --> 13:41.667
Did we?

13:41.707 --> 13:43.218
You wanted to.

13:43.347 --> 13:45.484
If you hadn't been totally
fucking AWOL...

13:45.519 --> 13:48.851
No. I didn't.

13:48.886 --> 13:49.832
Yeah?

13:50.099 --> 13:51.568
Otherwise,

13:52.131 --> 13:53.987
what have we been doing?

13:54.704 --> 13:56.594
What have you been doing?

13:57.614 --> 13:59.404
She thinks I'm straight!

13:59.465 --> 14:01.403
What?
How do you even...

14:01.438 --> 14:03.462
Said it when she was
looking at my tits, didn't she?

14:04.254 --> 14:06.031
Bit fucked up, that.

14:13.743 --> 14:16.354
I don't want to be
fucked around, Emily.

14:17.696 --> 14:20.026
Just cos she won't
take you to Goa.

14:26.028 --> 14:27.242
Don't.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.838
I'd take you.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.622
We'd go dancing.

14:36.722 --> 14:38.230
Sleep in a hut.

14:39.923 --> 14:42.176
I'd make love to you
on the beach.

14:45.745 --> 14:47.573
Isn't that
what you want?

14:51.138 --> 14:53.504
Ems! Mandy!
Breakfast!

14:53.505 --> 14:56.695
Oh, yeah. There's someone here
you've got to meet.

15:19.163 --> 15:20.173
You're Freddie's sister.

15:20.406 --> 15:22.852
Yeah.
Thomas, right?

15:24.534 --> 15:26.575
I thought maybe
he's hiding in here.

15:26.892 --> 15:28.058
Why would he hide
from you?

15:29.281 --> 15:31.231
I don't know.
But something's not right.

15:31.266 --> 15:32.065
So I want to...

15:33.715 --> 15:35.044
I don't fit here.

15:35.439 --> 15:38.292
I don't think it matters.
I don't fit anywhere.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.825
But I like
all the wrong things.

15:41.068 --> 15:42.995
- Like?
- You know.

15:43.713 --> 15:46.376
Gossip Girl, Davina,
Dick Van Dyke,

15:46.411 --> 15:47.974
Lady And The Tramp,
Hannah Montana,

15:48.014 --> 15:50.034
Monster Trucks,
Dancing On Ice,

15:50.074 --> 15:54.914
mojitos, Rio Ferdinand,
Marsala Zone, Pop Tarts,

15:55.023 --> 15:58.959
Jude Law's accent in Cold Mountain,
hair straighteners, Love Actually,

15:59.012 --> 16:03.618
Kylie, Whitney, Britney, Robbie,
Brucie, L'Oreal, Wild At Heart,

16:04.053 --> 16:04.867
milk,

16:04.907 --> 16:08.981
Comic Relief, ponies,
Posh, Becks, pecs,

16:09.016 --> 16:11.168
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
and heavy petting.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.938
Oh, I fucking love that!

16:16.406 --> 16:19.443
Anyway, Freddie doesn't
mind what I like.

16:21.821 --> 16:24.256
If they knew where he was,
they'd tell me, right?

16:24.449 --> 16:26.051
Let's ask.

16:28.310 --> 16:31.078
I like to run.
I run like a dog.

16:31.709 --> 16:34.232
Cute.
So what are you doing here?

16:34.267 --> 16:35.856
Oh, Katie has a plan.

16:36.158 --> 16:38.226
I'm supposed to teach her French
for her interview.

16:38.261 --> 16:40.979
You know, Panda notices
that we are a little too friendly.

16:41.014 --> 16:42.604
She's jealous,
and she wants me back

16:42.639 --> 16:45.345
because she can't stand to see me
giving Katie French.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.572
It's a good plan, yes?

16:49.160 --> 16:50.212
Go for it.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.478
- Panda?
- Yo.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.928
You're looking happy.

16:54.963 --> 16:57.976
Am I? That's weird.
I'm suicidal, obviously.

16:59.470 --> 17:02.853
Because your boyfriend smashed
your heart into 1,000 pieces

17:02.888 --> 17:03.832
seven months ago?

17:03.867 --> 17:06.220
Yup. He did that.
Tragic, ain't it?

17:06.592 --> 17:07.351
Bummer.

17:10.827 --> 17:12.929
Thomas is coming round
to Naomi's later

17:13.215 --> 17:15.287
to give me French lessons
for my interview.

17:16.621 --> 17:17.960
That's kind of him,
isn't it?

17:18.050 --> 17:18.810
Yeah, kind.

17:32.608 --> 17:34.745
Hmm, you like a bit
of cheese cake, innit?

17:35.980 --> 17:38.960
Well, this is... nice,
isn't it?

17:38.995 --> 17:41.420
Yeah, it's nice.
I think it's nice.

17:41.455 --> 17:44.839
I'm doing cocktails.
Who wants a Ball Breaker?

17:45.355 --> 17:47.415
- Um...
- I've got rum,

17:47.450 --> 17:52.769
creme de menthe, ouzo
and... rum.

17:52.779 --> 17:54.786
- I'm fine.
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

17:54.826 --> 17:56.066
Oh, come on!

17:56.106 --> 17:58.901
What's wrong with everyone?!
It's nearly half eleven.

17:58.936 --> 18:01.755
I'll have one. I love that
creme de menth-ay stuff.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.164
Makes you piss green, innit?

18:03.199 --> 18:04.129
There you go.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.582
Come on, you pussies.
Ball Breakers. They're cool.

18:07.967 --> 18:09.743
If Effy's having one,
you can all fucking...

18:13.616 --> 18:15.030
What did you call her?

18:15.265 --> 18:18.663
Um... I might have
made a slight...

18:18.698 --> 18:21.002
Her name's Arcia,
for fuck sakes!

18:21.433 --> 18:22.965
Why's everybody weirding her?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.965
Yeah. Your friends
are weirdal, Cook.

18:26.416 --> 18:28.496
They don't half fucking stare,
do 'ey?

18:33.032 --> 18:34.221
Oh, man!

18:34.256 --> 18:36.294
Um, I just remembered,
you gotta go.

18:36.329 --> 18:36.847
What?

18:36.882 --> 18:39.193
Something's come up.
I've gotta, um...

18:39.228 --> 18:40.751
But we was gonna
get piercings.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.215
Yeah, yeah,
and we will soon.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.737
- Soon...
- What the fuck?!

18:43.772 --> 18:46.958
You said you was gonna be
right up my alley, wasn't it?

18:46.998 --> 18:50.169
Yeah...

18:50.209 --> 18:51.579
Yeah, bye.

18:53.310 --> 18:54.821
Screw you!

18:55.568 --> 18:56.764
Did I do that?

18:57.467 --> 18:58.767
Yeah, you kinda.

19:04.224 --> 19:05.098
I'll go.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.622
Cook...

19:11.405 --> 19:12.801
I'm losing it, man.

19:12.802 --> 19:14.246
Cook, come and
talk to me.

19:16.912 --> 19:19.031
I never clocked
that she looked like Eff, I swear.

19:19.066 --> 19:20.787
Chrissakes,
stop being a tit.

19:21.707 --> 19:22.618
Freddie.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.684
Something's up.

19:25.426 --> 19:28.284
Look, Karen, I've asked around.
There is no sign of Freds.

19:28.319 --> 19:29.749
He's legged it,
that's all there is.

19:29.784 --> 19:31.023
You owe him, Cook.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.661
When you ran off last year,
who came looking for you?

19:33.696 --> 19:34.866
That's only cos I took his girl
with me...

19:36.287 --> 19:38.182
You stupid bastard!

19:38.217 --> 19:40.278
- What is wrong with you all?
- Fuck.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.886
You find him.
You fucking find my brother.

19:43.003 --> 19:45.153
Karen, I'm sorry.

19:45.188 --> 19:47.008
- I miss him too.
- No, you don't.

19:47.518 --> 19:48.881
Nobody loves him
like I do.

19:48.916 --> 19:50.800
Not even
that crazy bitch, Effy.

19:52.437 --> 19:54.362
He's all I've got.

19:55.058 --> 19:56.697
God knows
he's all you've got.

19:58.954 --> 20:00.597
Read that and tell me
there is nothing wrong.

20:00.972 --> 20:02.669
I'll give you a blowjob
every day for a year

20:02.704 --> 20:03.921
if that's
all you care about.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.936
You've got me wrong,
Karen.

20:11.946 --> 20:12.378
Show me.

20:46.891 --> 20:48.690
So do I, Freds.

20:50.822 --> 20:52.221
So do I.

21:20.462 --> 21:21.107
Come on.

21:21.142 --> 21:22.491
Where's everybody going?

21:23.969 --> 21:25.535
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:25.570 --> 21:26.903
I'm going.

21:27.290 --> 21:28.516
The atmosphere's
not great in there.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.908
Naom's caning
the spliff again.

21:30.943 --> 21:32.168
Yeah, and the rest.

21:32.637 --> 21:34.849
Well, let's go get
some of that baby food.

21:41.844 --> 21:43.379
Hi, Tommo.

21:43.414 --> 21:46.590
Panda. Katie, are you ready
for some French?

21:46.625 --> 21:49.406
Yes, thanks, Thomas, I'd love some.
You remember I said...

21:49.441 --> 21:50.574
Yeah, I remember.

21:54.005 --> 21:55.212
I'm pretty cool, huh?

21:55.247 --> 21:56.154
Do you think she cares?

21:56.189 --> 21:57.145
Oh, she cares.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.627
What's going on in there?

22:00.378 --> 22:01.878
Je ne sais rien, putain.
(Fuck, I don't know anything)

22:01.974 --> 22:04.159
- Huh?
- It's time for our lesson, Katie.

22:06.212 --> 22:07.395
Where's everybody gone?

22:12.181 --> 22:13.204
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:14.424 --> 22:16.254
- What is it?
- It's Mandy.

22:16.392 --> 22:19.134
Yeah, yeah.
You can dance. Come on.

22:19.484 --> 22:21.328
I gotta get going.

22:21.363 --> 22:22.403
No. No.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.191
Everyone's so fucking pissy.

22:28.186 --> 22:31.687
Come on. Emsy's got the gob on
and I wanna party.

22:31.722 --> 22:33.383
That's all we have to do.

22:33.984 --> 22:36.320
OK. Why not?

22:36.360 --> 22:38.792
There you go. You hear that?
Why not.

22:42.401 --> 22:44.709
Let's have
a bit more volume.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.119
Better!

23:21.649 --> 23:23.127
You dance pretty good...

23:23.162 --> 23:24.740
for a straight girl.

23:25.753 --> 23:28.520
Yeah. We...
We had problems.

23:28.555 --> 23:31.883
Me and Emsy.
Cos... Cos I was...

23:32.486 --> 23:34.576
I was bad, and...

23:35.149 --> 23:36.593
That right, Ems?

23:38.337 --> 23:39.456
See?

23:40.391 --> 23:41.547
I'm forgiven.

23:42.637 --> 23:45.361
It's just been heaven
these last months.

23:46.043 --> 23:47.537
Fucking heaven.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.325
I'm only saying...

23:54.657 --> 23:56.426
I'm only saying
because...

23:59.391 --> 24:00.554
Naomi...

24:08.240 --> 24:08.995
Eh?

24:09.614 --> 24:10.679
If you don't want her...

24:11.405 --> 24:12.480
I do.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.607
Combien de fois
allons-nous baiser?

24:46.158 --> 24:48.312
Combien de fois
nous allons baiser?

24:48.347 --> 24:49.539
It's future conditional.

24:52.145 --> 24:53.100
Hang on, let me try again.

24:53.420 --> 24:56.325
Combien de fois...
nous allons baiser?

24:56.360 --> 24:58.360
Awful.
You're actually terrible.

24:58.912 --> 25:00.715
I know. I'm terrible.

25:00.755 --> 25:02.454
Let me try again.

25:02.494 --> 25:06.430
Combien de fois
nous... allons... baiser.

25:06.465 --> 25:07.554
Not even close!

25:07.589 --> 25:09.401
Watch my lips,
listen to how I say it.

25:09.441 --> 25:12.164
Combien de fois
allons-nous baiser.

25:12.204 --> 25:17.186
Alright, I think I've got it.
Combien de fois nous allons baiser?

25:17.221 --> 25:19.570
No, you're not listening.
One more time.

25:20.011 --> 25:22.641
Combien de fois
allons-nous baiser.

25:27.478 --> 25:28.338
Try this one...

25:30.915 --> 25:34.358
OK... Tes mamelons
se leveront pour moi.

25:35.896 --> 25:37.678
- What the fuck's "mamelons"?
- These.

25:37.718 --> 25:41.450
You cheeky bastard. Honestly!

25:41.485 --> 25:43.591
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.747
No, no, no.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

25:52.053 --> 25:52.887
No, it wasn't...

25:52.922 --> 25:53.738
I thought we were...

25:54.760 --> 25:56.038
No, that's not right.

25:57.742 --> 25:59.916
I'm such a dozy bitch!

26:00.293 --> 26:02.138
I didn't realise.

26:02.359 --> 26:03.265
What?

26:03.305 --> 26:05.297
Don't make me say it,
Tommo.

26:18.213 --> 26:21.644
You are beautiful, Katie,
in so many ways.

26:22.818 --> 26:25.658
But I can't stop loving her.
Sorry.

26:30.386 --> 26:31.648
Oh, fuck!

26:46.639 --> 26:48.168
I love you.

26:50.372 --> 26:51.930
Don't lie.

27:04.218 --> 27:05.930
My mum's coming back
next week.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.408
Maybe you should go.

27:42.603 --> 27:43.750
Cook!

27:46.457 --> 27:47.765
What?

27:49.291 --> 27:50.264
Freds?

28:14.760 --> 28:16.170
Hey, Fredster.

28:20.721 --> 28:22.056
Look where we ended up.

28:24.432 --> 28:26.742
All back
at Naomi Campbell's.

29:01.488 --> 29:02.882
Naomi...

29:04.000 --> 29:05.180
Naomi!

29:05.626 --> 29:08.976
Bit loud. Bit loud!

29:28.134 --> 29:29.249
Fuck!

29:29.639 --> 29:30.313
What?

29:32.169 --> 29:34.340
Cook! Cook!

29:35.475 --> 29:37.560
What the fuck?!
What's happening?

29:37.626 --> 29:39.391
- Gotta go, Cookie, the fuzz.
- I'm on it.

29:39.392 --> 29:41.099
Open the door!
Police!

29:41.520 --> 29:43.144
Always looking good
in lingerie, Panda.

29:46.457 --> 29:48.180
This is the police,
open the door!

29:54.432 --> 29:57.102
This is the police,
open the door.

29:57.142 --> 29:58.474
James Cook?

30:00.157 --> 30:03.129
Open the door.
This is your last chance.

30:05.262 --> 30:06.940
Right, OK, step back.

30:08.317 --> 30:09.659
James Cook!

30:09.686 --> 30:11.685
Police,
stay where you are!

30:11.762 --> 30:13.522
You, stay there.

30:14.293 --> 30:15.730
Where's James Cook?

30:16.023 --> 30:16.813
Where is he?

30:25.560 --> 30:27.221
Come on.

30:28.257 --> 30:30.041
Yeah...

30:34.744 --> 30:36.387
You train pretty hard.

30:36.899 --> 30:37.750
Yeah.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.255
I run fast...

30:39.760 --> 30:40.737
like a dog.

30:42.416 --> 30:45.502
Perry, I'm still fucking
watching you, you know!

30:45.503 --> 30:49.463
17, 18, come on.
Shape. Shape. Move!

30:52.518 --> 30:57.636
You just ran 400 metres
in 48.2 seconds.

30:57.671 --> 30:58.590
So?

30:58.625 --> 30:59.294
So?!

30:59.691 --> 31:03.242
That would put you in the European
Junior Championships, that's all.

31:03.364 --> 31:05.822
I'm not from Europe.
I'm from Congo.

31:06.167 --> 31:07.654
So what you
doing here, then?

31:07.655 --> 31:10.644
Nothing.
I work. I run. So?

31:11.368 --> 31:12.396
No college?

31:13.764 --> 31:14.466
Why not?

31:14.473 --> 31:15.720
And I mind
my own business.

31:16.003 --> 31:16.991
Sure you do.

31:17.844 --> 31:20.754
You could be in university,
a shit-load of universities.

31:20.789 --> 31:23.709
You know, there are scholarships
for boys like you.

31:25.246 --> 31:26.216
Boys like me?

31:26.703 --> 31:30.013
Yes. Boys that run fast.
Problem?

31:32.212 --> 31:33.592
I can do many things.

31:33.698 --> 31:35.594
I don't have to run for Whitey
to get what I want.

31:37.091 --> 31:39.374
No? OK.

31:40.313 --> 31:44.035
Perry, if you do not put
that fag out of your mouth,

31:44.116 --> 31:46.712
I am going
to ram it up your arse.

31:49.747 --> 31:51.069
Neither do I.

31:52.604 --> 31:55.338
You... can call me.

31:58.812 --> 32:00.235
And fix your head.

32:01.074 --> 32:03.328
We gotta take our chances,
young blood.

32:03.917 --> 32:06.731
Otherwise,
what else we got?

32:11.762 --> 32:13.957
Right, Perry, get down!
Squat thrusts!

32:14.320 --> 32:17.146
Two, three.
You are going to puke your guts,

32:17.186 --> 32:21.455
or I'm going to rip your balls out
and sell them to Nando's!

32:21.456 --> 32:22.389
Come on!

32:43.433 --> 32:45.082
You fuck
everything up again?

32:48.787 --> 32:49.899
Yeah.

32:51.325 --> 32:53.329
It's his birthday today.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.256
Yeah.

33:05.188 --> 33:06.226
Do you think
he'd mind?

33:14.559 --> 33:16.421
Freds probably got scared.

33:17.390 --> 33:18.508
I'm pretty scary.

33:19.308 --> 33:20.182
Yep.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.356
But I can't not know...

33:25.430 --> 33:27.097
if he couldn't bear it.

33:28.670 --> 33:29.982
I can handle it.

33:31.622 --> 33:32.986
I think
I can handle it.

34:14.746 --> 34:16.853
We'll go and find him.
All right?

34:23.498 --> 34:26.379
My powers of deductive
reasoning are unparalleled.

34:26.688 --> 34:29.496
They're actually hunting you
with dogs. Impressive.

34:29.737 --> 34:32.370
Anyway, we weren't sure
if the coast was clear.

34:32.429 --> 34:33.442
What do you mean, "we"?

34:34.128 --> 34:37.137
Yeah, and it's a bit chilly
hiding out there in the garden.

34:39.103 --> 34:41.313
The sea eagles
are roosting.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.277
Hello, Eff.

34:50.396 --> 34:51.891
I've been trying
to tell you something.

34:52.521 --> 34:53.989
Spit it out, Panda-pops.

34:56.768 --> 34:57.959
I'm going away.

34:59.668 --> 35:02.498
Really? Fine.
Where?

35:02.737 --> 35:04.775
Harvard.
On a history scholarship.

35:06.592 --> 35:08.980
I might have done some exams
without telling anyone.

35:26.868 --> 35:27.734
Hello, Mum.

35:30.502 --> 35:33.685
Yeah. Looking forward
to seeing you, too.

35:36.732 --> 35:41.573
Oh, no. Nothing much.
Just... the usual stuff.

35:46.056 --> 35:49.669
Yeah, I accepted a place
at Goldsmiths, but...

35:53.349 --> 35:55.237
I know how proud
you are of me, Mum.

35:57.371 --> 35:58.871
I love you, too.

36:14.103 --> 36:15.509
It's all over.

36:41.358 --> 36:42.778
I thought...

36:43.383 --> 36:45.068
What the fuck
are you doing?

36:45.564 --> 36:48.377
We're having a party.
Freds'd like it. Don't you think?

36:50.102 --> 36:53.308
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess he would.

38:17.564 --> 38:20.542
So here!
I guess it's round here.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.588
- Hi, Thomas.
- Hey!

38:32.335 --> 38:33.696
I've never
been here before,

38:34.174 --> 38:35.529
to Freddie's shed.

38:36.224 --> 38:38.039
Yeah. Same here.

38:38.780 --> 38:40.933
First time
for everything, yeah?

38:42.634 --> 38:43.304
Yeah.

38:45.080 --> 38:48.034
Right.
Let's get this party started.

38:57.111 --> 38:59.312
What the fuck
kind of lame-o rave is this?!

39:00.677 --> 39:01.584
I dressed up.

39:01.624 --> 39:03.942
Yeah. Well, pardon me for farting,
dinky tits.

39:04.279 --> 39:05.444
You took long enough
getting here.

39:05.479 --> 39:07.008
We're playing Ace of Truth.

39:07.228 --> 39:08.873
And I can tell you we've learned
a few things tonight.

39:08.923 --> 39:10.894
- Haven't we, Karen?
- You said it had to be shocking.

39:11.499 --> 39:13.851
- Yeah.
- Please don't say it.

39:13.886 --> 39:14.787
I'm still feeling queasy.

39:15.054 --> 39:16.613
Who's going to start?

39:23.268 --> 39:24.457
I will.

39:31.723 --> 39:33.811
I've loved you
from the first time I saw you.

39:34.475 --> 39:36.059
I think I was 12.

39:36.753 --> 39:40.112
It took me three years to pluck up
the courage to speak to you,

39:40.198 --> 39:43.324
and I was so scared of the way
I felt, you know,

39:43.763 --> 39:45.299
loving a girl,

39:45.595 --> 39:48.065
that I learned how
to become a sarcastic bitch

39:48.100 --> 39:49.366
just to make it
feel normal.

39:51.536 --> 39:53.812
I screwed guys
to make it go away,

39:53.852 --> 39:55.413
but it didn't work.

39:56.897 --> 39:59.752
When we got together,
it scared the shit out of me,

39:59.787 --> 40:04.437
because... you were the one person
who could ruin my life.

40:07.548 --> 40:11.166
I pushed you away and made you
think things were your fault,

40:11.167 --> 40:14.116
but really I was just terrified
of pain.

40:16.044 --> 40:19.248
I screwed that girl Sophia
to kind of spite you

40:19.283 --> 40:20.514
for having a hold on me

40:20.953 --> 40:24.857
and I'm a total fucking coward,
because... I got...

40:27.334 --> 40:28.977
...these...

40:31.266 --> 40:34.087
these tickets to Goa for us
three months ago...

40:35.698 --> 40:38.196
...but I...
I couldn't stand...

40:41.144 --> 40:44.320
I didn't want to be a slave
to the way I feel about you.

40:45.498 --> 40:47.096
Can you understand?

40:49.376 --> 40:52.298
You were trying to punish me back,
and it's horrible.

40:52.431 --> 40:54.636
It's so horrible
because...

40:55.296 --> 40:58.708
Really, I'd die for you.

40:59.637 --> 41:00.838
I love you.

41:02.191 --> 41:04.988
I love you so much
it's killing me.

42:36.789 --> 42:37.765
Freds?

42:52.463 --> 42:53.234
Who's that?

43:38.925 --> 43:40.123
I'm going away, Panda.

43:40.715 --> 43:44.451
Yes. Even though I have no exams,
I have a chance to study.

43:44.486 --> 43:47.517
They have a scholarship for athletes.
A friend is going to help me.

43:47.896 --> 43:51.141
Right.
I was going to tell...

43:51.176 --> 43:52.345
It's a long way away.

43:52.677 --> 43:53.606
The USA.

43:54.403 --> 43:55.313
It's called Harvard.

43:56.604 --> 43:59.670
I think I have a chance there.
I can make a new start.

44:00.491 --> 44:03.834
And you know...
I run like a dog.

44:07.717 --> 44:08.862
That sounds cool, Tommo.

44:16.809 --> 44:17.752
Wacker.

45:13.283 --> 45:14.618
What?

45:30.698 --> 45:31.894
Get out.

45:43.347 --> 45:44.707
What have you done?

45:46.853 --> 45:49.035
Don't be stupid, Cook.

45:49.497 --> 45:51.743
She told me
all about you too.

45:52.407 --> 45:53.991
There was much
to correct in that girl.

45:55.364 --> 45:56.543
I almost managed it.

45:57.808 --> 45:59.134
Perhaps I still can.

45:59.764 --> 46:00.884
You...

46:02.609 --> 46:03.985
You did something
to my friend.

46:04.020 --> 46:05.181
This is wasting time.

46:07.272 --> 46:09.024
Would you kneel down,
please?

46:09.576 --> 46:10.544
Mr Foster...

46:10.579 --> 46:12.927
Dr Foster, actually.

46:14.571 --> 46:16.064
Kneel down, please.

46:29.300 --> 46:31.620
I don't think you know
what I am, mate.

46:31.655 --> 46:35.699
I think I do.
You're nothing.

46:36.985 --> 46:39.926
You don't deserve that girl.
And, you know...

46:41.029 --> 46:42.154
I do.

46:44.379 --> 46:46.033
I'm a fucking
waste of space.

46:47.728 --> 46:49.144
I'm just a stupid kid.

46:50.569 --> 46:52.052
I got no sense.

46:53.337 --> 46:54.318
Criminal.

46:57.103 --> 46:58.900
I'm no fucking use, man.

47:00.625 --> 47:01.852
I am nothing.

47:03.108 --> 47:04.152
So please...

47:05.169 --> 47:06.639
Please...

47:07.410 --> 47:08.946
Get it into your...
you know...

47:09.530 --> 47:10.935
Into your bonks.

47:12.528 --> 47:13.777
That you killed my friend.

47:18.987 --> 47:19.932
I'm Cook.

47:21.679 --> 47:24.235
I'm Cook!
