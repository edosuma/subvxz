00:03.789 --> 00:05.898

00:05.960 --> 00:07.628
Bagsy, Sparrow.

00:07.855 --> 00:09.252
If she was my girl, I wouldn't hide her.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.664
I'm a royal. She's not.

00:11.736 --> 00:13.277
How could you? These letters

00:13.324 --> 00:16.303
were supposed to be between us. Not us!

00:16.566 --> 00:18.557
Don't ever doubt your words again,
they're perfect.

00:18.581 --> 00:20.093
Just believe in them.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.367
(CYRUS) You tricked me.

00:22.434 --> 00:25.640
If you think I'm giving up
my reign without a fight,

00:25.724 --> 00:27.523
you'd better watch your back.

00:27.791 --> 00:30.914
<i> # Kingliam seems to be everywhere.</i>

00:31.195 --> 00:33.484
Simon is your biological father.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.468
I need you to believe in me now.

00:35.609 --> 00:37.792
This is your last night as King.

00:38.136 --> 00:39.945
Things are gonna change for you now.

01:14.462 --> 01:15.874
Lenny.

01:17.255 --> 01:18.976
Lenny.

01:20.837 --> 01:22.554
- Lenny.
- Hm?

01:23.503 --> 01:24.906
Come here.

01:38.573 --> 01:40.632
Robby?

01:41.046 --> 01:42.920
You always did make
everything about you.

01:42.992 --> 01:44.992
(Both laugh)

01:47.117 --> 01:49.885
Right, I've ordered tea
to the Blue State Room,

01:49.929 --> 01:51.887
which will be served momentarily,

01:52.077 --> 01:55.090
and, um, have you caught
your sister up yet?

01:55.163 --> 01:57.781
Mother, relax. Come here, join us.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.023
(Scoffs) I've no idea

02:08.124 --> 02:09.531
what kind of shit you're up to now,

02:09.616 --> 02:11.173
but you've already won.

02:11.390 --> 02:13.413
What could you possibly
need with a Robert double?

02:13.468 --> 02:15.554
Uncle Cyrus.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.421
Maybe it is you.

02:18.538 --> 02:22.538
(Sighs) Well, if so, I guess you've
all got a lot to catch up on.

02:22.804 --> 02:25.843
To be clear, Daddy's dead.

02:27.691 --> 02:29.343
Discuss.

02:37.460 --> 02:40.109
Here's the file on your death.

02:40.439 --> 02:42.945
And... the one on your father's.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.672
I want to say, Your Majesty,

02:46.696 --> 02:48.984
it's an absolute honor to have you back.

02:49.881 --> 02:52.114
Thank you, Mr. Hill.

02:52.601 --> 02:55.687
What's on this disk is a little graphic,

02:55.851 --> 02:57.085
I must warn you.

02:57.146 --> 02:59.734
But if you... feel you need to see it...

03:02.159 --> 03:04.429
I'll let you have some time
on your own, then.

04:06.819 --> 04:08.858
It is so much better in the morning.

04:08.942 --> 04:12.483
Mm. So much better.

04:13.132 --> 04:16.366
I mean,
it's not too shabby at night either.

04:16.934 --> 04:18.952
Mm, but this,

04:19.507 --> 04:21.101
in the morning,

04:21.409 --> 04:23.436
just feels right.

04:24.826 --> 04:26.311
This does feel right.

04:27.772 --> 04:29.210
And the crazy thing is,

04:29.297 --> 04:31.811
I don't even have the urge
to reach for my phone.

04:32.007 --> 04:33.514
I don't even know where it is.

04:33.647 --> 04:34.883
And I don't care.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.358
Usually it's sex then phone.

04:38.577 --> 04:40.644
As soon as I turn my phone on...

04:41.953 --> 04:43.632
all of this goes away.

04:44.764 --> 04:46.761
It can wait ten more minutes.

04:49.958 --> 04:51.616
Hear hear.

04:52.389 --> 04:53.935
Ahem!

04:54.155 --> 04:55.882
Jasper! You scared the hell out of us!

04:55.951 --> 04:58.311
You need to return to the palace
immediately, Your Highness.

04:58.358 --> 05:00.155
Since when do you call me...

05:00.245 --> 05:03.796

Oh, yeah? What was that?

06:03.561 --> 06:05.514
That's between me and him.

06:09.385 --> 06:11.632
I was supposed to meet him for his walk.

06:12.499 --> 06:14.292
The night it happened.

06:14.483 --> 06:17.538
- Why didn't you?
- I was with a girl.

06:17.889 --> 06:21.585
- Anyone important?
- It's a long story.

06:24.193 --> 06:26.027
You couldn't have known.

06:29.038 --> 06:32.460
Been gone less than a year,
yet it feels like a lifetime.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.467
I've missed so much.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.720
(Message alert)

06:42.908 --> 06:44.777
Everything OK?

06:44.925 --> 06:46.798
Seemed Serious.

06:47.034 --> 06:52.801
Yes, but not on secure network.
Talk soon.

07:01.605 --> 07:03.309
(Sighs)

07:03.598 --> 07:06.832
Sire, look what I've done.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.512
I look just like my Majesty again.

07:11.254 --> 07:13.121
Good for you, Chad.

07:13.371 --> 07:16.957
But for the last time,
I'm not going to be king anymore.

07:17.184 --> 07:19.652
The only remaining gig
will be lying in my casket.

07:19.726 --> 07:22.494
- But, Your Majesty...
- (Groans)

07:22.543 --> 07:24.762
We had a good run, you and me,

07:24.949 --> 07:27.879
but your services are
no longer required.

07:28.434 --> 07:30.684
Maybe you should go back to just being

07:30.723 --> 07:32.551
incredibly handsome.

07:37.575 --> 07:39.309
Vanish.

07:40.338 --> 07:42.471
You daft thing.

07:47.082 --> 07:48.482
For us to keep this from the public

07:48.520 --> 07:51.145
we need to appear business as usual.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.738
So, send a couple of tweets,

07:53.926 --> 07:57.434
Instagram a selfie,
or a plate of food, or whatever.

07:57.605 --> 07:58.926
Not you, Robert, obviously.

07:59.504 --> 08:00.959
(She chuckles)

08:01.191 --> 08:04.020
How many people were
involved in the rescue?

08:04.395 --> 08:07.572
Once I called MI6,
they informed a handful of admins

08:07.613 --> 08:09.174
with top security clearance.

08:09.246 --> 08:12.051
Then there were the
four military extractors

08:12.085 --> 08:13.559
that I know and trust.

08:13.691 --> 08:15.715
I told them I had to tell you in person.

08:15.926 --> 08:17.715
They dropped me at the tunnel entrance.

08:17.813 --> 08:20.660
What were they going to
say to the prince? No?

08:20.855 --> 08:23.629
We need to keep a tight
lid on this for now.

08:23.824 --> 08:25.371
- So, Eleanor.
- Yup.

08:25.459 --> 08:28.824
Proceed with the preliminary
interview with Vanity Fair

08:28.933 --> 08:32.082
and don't give any
indication of abnormalities.

08:33.683 --> 08:36.308
(ROBERT) What are your
thoughts on going public?

08:36.441 --> 08:38.871
(HELENA) We'll use the press
conference we had scheduled.

08:38.957 --> 08:40.739
Great. What was that for?

08:40.847 --> 08:43.323
To announce your brother
and sister officially proven

08:43.386 --> 08:45.372
as... Simon's children.

08:45.679 --> 08:46.941
(Eleanor chuckles)

08:47.066 --> 08:48.957
- What?
- Yeah.

08:49.105 --> 08:51.516
- Seriously, Mum?
- It wasn't my finest hour.

08:51.676 --> 08:54.176
- You can say that again.
- Hear hear.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.066
So who will introduce Robby
at the press conference?

08:57.309 --> 08:59.332
- Mum should.
- (HELENA) Agreed.

08:59.407 --> 09:01.848
Shall I have the writers
prepare you a speech?

09:02.246 --> 09:04.285
Of course not. It's been a while, son.

09:04.551 --> 09:07.512
Can I just say that this
is happening right now?

09:07.988 --> 09:10.129
We're here, all of us.

09:12.676 --> 09:14.738
Your dear late brother
returns from the dead

09:14.805 --> 09:16.488
and you can't stop texting.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.801
Mm, some things never change.

09:19.450 --> 09:21.004
Yeah.

09:24.519 --> 09:26.238
(ELEANOR) Yeah,
I'm really not interested

09:26.348 --> 09:29.121
in some kind of expose on my nightlife

09:29.230 --> 09:30.848
or gossip expedition.

09:30.881 --> 09:34.039
<i>(MAN) Absolutely not.
We couldn't be less interested in that.</i>

09:34.143 --> 09:36.777
Okay. It would need to have
some kind of special angle

09:36.897 --> 09:39.789
or point of view.
And who do you suggest style it?

09:39.995 --> 09:42.478
<i>(MAN) Well, we thought you would.</i>

09:42.861 --> 09:44.681
(ELEANOR) I'll think about
it and get back to you.

09:44.705 --> 09:46.728
- I'm not saying no.
<i>- (MAN) Brilliant.</i>

09:46.822 --> 09:48.768
<i>Please take your time, Your Highness.
Talk soon.</i>

09:48.850 --> 09:50.283
Yep.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.878
(Robert claps)

09:53.986 --> 09:56.330
- Oh.
- Wow, little sis!

09:56.447 --> 09:58.807
All grown up. Very impressive.

09:58.939 --> 10:00.406
You never even did interviews before,

10:00.430 --> 10:02.663
let along grant access for a full piece.

10:02.805 --> 10:06.166
Mum asked me to pitch in a
bit with the family image.

10:06.248 --> 10:08.015
Well, I'm proud of you.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.143
Hey, how did the...

10:14.627 --> 10:17.721
Er... Robert, this is Jasper Frost,

10:17.778 --> 10:19.102
Liam's security detail.

10:19.158 --> 10:22.212
Hello, Mr. Frost. You're
probably looking for Liam.

10:22.502 --> 10:23.441
Liam!

10:23.443 --> 10:26.142
(Laughs) Not here, Mr. Frost.

10:30.359 --> 10:32.617
You'd think, if anyone,
he would know where Liam was.

10:32.710 --> 10:35.999
You... Right? I've no idea.

10:36.523 --> 10:38.124
Very strange.

10:50.707 --> 10:52.288
(Knocking on door)

10:54.703 --> 10:57.484
Just seeing how you're getting on.

10:57.687 --> 10:59.744
I apologize if it's weird
to be in a guest room

10:59.746 --> 11:01.146
that used to be your room.

11:03.717 --> 11:06.375
Your things are being
gathered from storage.

11:06.492 --> 11:09.039
Mum, please, relax.
You thought I was dead.

11:09.219 --> 11:11.281
No need to apologize.

11:11.476 --> 11:12.961
Nonsense. You're not a guest.

11:13.094 --> 11:16.695
Mum, it's what I want.
Something simple. Really.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.508
I just need to grab one
thing out of the boxes.

11:19.695 --> 11:21.750
Oh, and then all I need is that bed.

11:22.008 --> 11:24.202
I did more thinking on
that island about that bed

11:24.204 --> 11:25.555
than I care to admit.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.851
It's amazing the power an
object can hold over you

11:27.906 --> 11:29.461
if you let it.

11:29.570 --> 11:31.342
Luckily we kept that bed.

11:31.344 --> 11:34.012
Lucius thought it would be a
waste of funds to replace it.

11:35.078 --> 11:37.092
It's my job to claw back expenses

11:37.180 --> 11:39.651
so you continue to live
the royal lifestyle...

11:39.937 --> 11:42.787
(BOTH) ...the country expects of you.

11:42.851 --> 11:44.589
Where is Lucius, by the way?

11:45.525 --> 11:48.693
- (Sighs)
- Let me guess. Long story.

11:50.297 --> 11:52.597
Do I need to add your
name to the list of people

11:52.599 --> 11:55.433
who didn't end it well with Father?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.924
Top of the list.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.333
It was a distant couple of years for us,

12:01.411 --> 12:03.641
as I'm sure you remember.

12:05.857 --> 12:08.224
I hope you found the
time to see Alistair.

12:09.927 --> 12:12.377
Alistair has chosen
to never see me again.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.268
Same long story.

12:15.893 --> 12:18.362
So no Dad, no Lucius, no Alistair,

12:18.541 --> 12:23.127
and your old cohort, Cyr...
I mean King Cyrus.

12:23.244 --> 12:24.943
Shit.

12:26.667 --> 12:29.549
It must have been quite
lonely for you lately.

12:31.244 --> 12:33.487
No one feels sorry for us, my dear.

12:33.838 --> 12:37.268
No. That's why we have each other.

12:37.377 --> 12:40.932
And no need to any more,
'cause I've got you back.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.782
Right, I'll leave you to get some rest

12:45.807 --> 12:47.477
and then we'll get some
more food into you.

12:47.501 --> 12:48.626
You are too thin, darling.

12:48.656 --> 12:50.657
I've been on the Paleo diet.

You bitch.

14:48.325 --> 14:49.669
Slag.

14:49.754 --> 14:52.715
How dare you show your face here...

14:54.129 --> 14:57.036
without calling? What if I were out?

14:58.325 --> 15:00.887
Veruca Popplewell, Duchess of Essex,

15:00.949 --> 15:02.567
as I live and breathe.

15:02.661 --> 15:05.348
Darling, you look... exquisite.

15:05.536 --> 15:07.606
You and your Benjamin Button disease.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.545
Stop. You're more fabulous
every time I see you.

15:09.569 --> 15:11.723
Well, the game favors the young.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.786
The title only gets one so far.

15:13.903 --> 15:15.536
Tell me about it.

15:15.746 --> 15:18.215
So, to what do we owe

15:18.301 --> 15:20.223
this delightfully unexpected visit

15:20.254 --> 15:21.840
from my ex sister-in-law?

15:21.926 --> 15:23.603
I came as soon as I heard the news.

15:23.669 --> 15:25.692
I had to see the miracle for myself.

15:25.856 --> 15:27.774
And what news is that, darling?

15:27.848 --> 15:30.919
- Our retched king's cancer.
- Of course.

15:31.059 --> 15:32.348
You mean the big news.

15:32.401 --> 15:34.848
In fact, the only news anyone
is talking about round here.

15:35.032 --> 15:37.801
So, come for a front-row
seat to his misery, have you?

15:37.896 --> 15:39.270
You know me too well.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.583
Well, I hate to keep you
from your fun any longer,

15:41.630 --> 15:43.254
but please, let's brunch soon.

15:43.329 --> 15:44.961
Let's.

15:50.263 --> 15:51.929
(Exhales deeply)

15:53.231 --> 15:55.575
What a relief. I feared the worst.

15:55.738 --> 15:57.778
Perhaps don't relax just yet, ma'am.

15:57.897 --> 15:59.397
Crenshaw's on his way saying

15:59.450 --> 16:01.989
you'll very much like
to receive his audience.

16:02.145 --> 16:04.676
F-M-L.

16:07.206 --> 16:09.715
Skip the pleasantries.
I know why you're here

16:09.815 --> 16:11.661
and you know I can't comment

16:11.739 --> 16:13.465
on the report of the twins' paternity.

16:13.490 --> 16:15.490
I also know that you
offering a non-comment

16:15.515 --> 16:17.581
on something I myself
haven't yet brought up

16:17.645 --> 16:19.403
is all the confirmation I need.

16:19.428 --> 16:21.544
If that's the confirmation I was after.

16:21.612 --> 16:24.647
However,
this just validates my suspicion.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.786
What could be a bigger
story than the twins proven

16:27.889 --> 16:29.129
as Simon's children?

16:29.228 --> 16:31.628
That Robert is still alive.

16:32.504 --> 16:35.942
You know how absurd that sounds, right?

16:36.394 --> 16:37.809
Perhaps I'll let you run the story.

16:37.911 --> 16:39.934
It'll be the noose by
which you string up

16:39.959 --> 16:42.598
your own empire, Mr. Crenshaw.

16:43.192 --> 16:46.153
I have a very valuable source in MI6.

16:46.317 --> 16:48.512
I'm going to run my story.

16:48.786 --> 16:51.599
I just thought I'd give
you the opportunity for...

16:51.647 --> 16:53.098
A quote?

16:53.501 --> 16:57.684
"Opportunity."
Apropos word choice, Mr. Crenshaw.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.559
So now you know. You have a decision.

17:00.747 --> 17:03.661
Wait a measly 14 hours
for the press conference,

17:03.809 --> 17:07.028
and have the opportunity
to pre-write the full story

17:07.192 --> 17:08.833
with an exclusive, official interview

17:08.925 --> 17:10.762
about my time on the island.

17:10.934 --> 17:14.208
In addition to the
first query on camera.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.674
Opportunity seized.

17:17.105 --> 17:18.458
Or...

17:20.934 --> 17:22.356
you release the story.

17:22.481 --> 17:24.339
Have a few hundred page clicks

17:24.692 --> 17:27.075
on your increasingly
less relevant website

17:27.208 --> 17:29.129
as it gets drowned
out by the white noise

17:29.301 --> 17:30.598
of being the only publication

17:30.623 --> 17:33.924
to not have an official
quote from yours truly.

17:35.156 --> 17:37.155
Opportunity wasted.

17:39.053 --> 17:43.139
So, will you seize the
opportunity and be patient

17:43.303 --> 17:47.506
and parlay that patience
into a legacy-defining story?

17:50.491 --> 17:52.444
(Sighs)

17:54.447 --> 17:56.538
(Snoring)

17:58.733 --> 18:00.670
Hey!

18:00.811 --> 18:02.170
(Sighs deeply)

18:02.311 --> 18:05.077
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any worse.

18:05.194 --> 18:07.631
Why are there two?
I thought one had to be removed.

18:07.762 --> 18:10.280
It's a neuticle. A fake ball.

18:10.405 --> 18:12.280
Generous with the sizing, weren't we?

18:12.368 --> 18:14.413
Did you just come here to prod me?

18:14.506 --> 18:16.038
Yes, actually.

18:16.311 --> 18:18.475
But frankly,
you've taken all the fun out of it

18:18.538 --> 18:20.100
with this depressive scene.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.036
By the looks of it,
you won't be around long enough

18:22.060 --> 18:25.053
- for the cancer to take you.
- That's the idea.

18:25.202 --> 18:27.374
Don't let me stop you, then.

18:27.764 --> 18:29.217
I'll just take a peek at the will

18:29.286 --> 18:31.913
and then be on my way to leave you to...

18:32.183 --> 18:33.883
whatever this is.

18:33.964 --> 18:36.928
The halfwits will be well taken care of.

18:37.108 --> 18:38.686
They'll be able to flit around Dubai

18:38.747 --> 18:40.850
with the Eurotrash
from here to eternity.

18:40.897 --> 18:43.030
Or until you croak and Penelope returns

18:43.077 --> 18:45.819
to assume the crown with the
new Queen Mother at her side.

18:45.940 --> 18:47.999
(Laughs and winces)

18:48.436 --> 18:50.401
There'll be no Queen Motherhood for you,

18:50.522 --> 18:53.210
I'm afraid.
That bullshit artist friend of yours

18:53.241 --> 18:56.444
has proven her grating
twins are Simon's.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.788
Therefore, I'll be off the throne,

18:58.866 --> 19:00.420
so then will be Penelope.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.740
- Have them retest.
- It still won't matter,

19:02.827 --> 19:05.124
because it seems that Robert

19:05.235 --> 19:08.303
may or may not be alive as well.

19:08.608 --> 19:10.288
Define may or may not.

19:10.569 --> 19:13.491
I was a bit high, or drunk,

19:13.624 --> 19:16.569
or full of a deadly disease.
Take your pick.

19:16.741 --> 19:19.772
I wasn't exactly present
enough to know for sure.

19:19.913 --> 19:22.444
So it doesn't matter which
of the offspring it is,

19:22.535 --> 19:24.217
I'm losing the crown,
one way or another.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.929
(Slap)

19:26.905 --> 19:28.022
You're going to lie down

19:28.078 --> 19:31.053
while they put a legally
dead person on your throne?

19:31.233 --> 19:33.444
Where's the man I used to love to hate?

19:33.639 --> 19:35.397
That man used to preach religiously

19:35.475 --> 19:37.405
that there was always another way.

19:37.532 --> 19:39.866
That man wouldn't let doctors' results

19:40.006 --> 19:42.928
or Helena or cancer get in
the way of what he wanted.

19:42.989 --> 19:44.522
- (Slap)
- That man used to take

19:44.657 --> 19:46.288
whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted,

19:46.419 --> 19:48.545
and piss in the mouth of
anyone who spoke against him.

19:48.603 --> 19:49.999
- (Slap)
- That man...

19:50.082 --> 19:52.803
weaseled his way onto the throne

19:53.030 --> 19:55.432
of history's greatest empire.

19:55.506 --> 19:56.616
(Slap)

19:56.702 --> 19:58.678
Where the bloody hell is that man?

19:58.703 --> 20:01.186
- (Slap)
- Right here.

20:01.342 --> 20:03.256
I'm right here, Goddamnit.

20:03.438 --> 20:06.172
Hello, you miserable bastard.

20:06.335 --> 20:10.600
Now, put on your big-girl panties,

20:10.788 --> 20:13.811
or a pair of mine,
like you always liked to,

20:13.967 --> 20:17.202
and show them what a
real king looks like.

20:21.038 --> 20:22.733
Can you believe this?

20:22.944 --> 20:24.928
Is Robert really sitting
in the room down the hall

20:24.964 --> 20:27.420
- after all this time?
- I can't believe it.

20:27.592 --> 20:29.061
Except that it's true.

20:29.178 --> 20:30.952
It's like right when I think

20:30.977 --> 20:34.319
I've wrapped my mind around this,
it goes, "What?"

20:35.624 --> 20:37.866
I just hope Robby being
back will mean an end

20:37.930 --> 20:40.460
to all the drama the family's
been through this year.

20:40.594 --> 20:43.092
The Henstridges are overdue
for a period of no drama.

20:43.282 --> 20:44.811
Amen.

20:45.483 --> 20:46.797
Speaking of which,

20:46.875 --> 20:50.000
Liam, I need your advice on Jasper.

20:50.156 --> 20:52.000
I just don't know how,

20:52.148 --> 20:54.135
if, when to introduce him to Robert.

20:54.242 --> 20:56.570
It's nerve-racking,
not like the other bodyguards.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.578
This is like... real,

20:58.625 --> 21:00.164
and what if he doesn't like him?

21:00.166 --> 21:02.862
And Jasper is not exactly the standard

21:02.917 --> 21:03.987
"we met in a bar" story.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.252
Fair enough. But I know him better now.

21:07.018 --> 21:08.377
He's the one who found out about Ted.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.690
Right! I should lead with that, Liam.

21:10.692 --> 21:13.284
Well-Well, don't force it, Len.

21:13.324 --> 21:14.901
Let it come out naturally.

21:14.981 --> 21:16.510
Yeah, naturally. Obviously.

21:16.553 --> 21:18.120
Be honest and open with him.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.080
Okay.

21:20.370 --> 21:22.097
After what he's been through,
it's what he deserves.

21:22.121 --> 21:23.454
Yeah.

21:24.262 --> 21:27.992
Yes. Honest and natural.
Thank you. Great.

21:29.781 --> 21:31.594
(Grunts)

21:32.266 --> 21:34.039
There she is.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.492
It's where Dad gave me
my first sip of whisky.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.656
Kept a bottle there ever since.

21:39.922 --> 21:42.469
He always joked that we only
kept Scotland in the kingdom

21:42.517 --> 21:44.017
for their scotch.

21:46.612 --> 21:48.245
Cheers.

21:53.629 --> 21:54.996
For Dad.

21:58.352 --> 21:59.776
Are you okay?

22:00.774 --> 22:02.518
I know you've already processed this,

22:02.551 --> 22:05.386
but for me, my father just died.

22:07.042 --> 22:09.175
It doesn't get easier.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.360
- (Text alert)
- Shit. Sorry.

22:13.105 --> 22:14.961
So who is she?

22:18.125 --> 22:20.266
You were texting in the throne room,

22:20.438 --> 22:22.180
during lunch the whole time.

22:22.352 --> 22:23.938
There was a time when part of your game

22:23.977 --> 22:25.797
was leaving them a day or two to respond

22:25.828 --> 22:26.906
so they'd freak out.

22:26.977 --> 22:29.141
Then you waited till the perfect moment.

22:29.352 --> 22:32.406
Now you're the one freaking
out to speak to her.

22:32.953 --> 22:35.352
Who is she? Is it anyone serious?

22:35.453 --> 22:37.985
It's nothing. Just a girl.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.828
If you say so.

22:42.633 --> 22:45.079
Let's take a walk tonight. Just us.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.711
You can't. You're supposed to be dead.

22:48.566 --> 22:49.977
Exactly.

22:50.033 --> 22:52.766
And I've only got 12
more hours to be dead.

22:54.469 --> 22:56.242
Meet me after dark.

22:57.535 --> 22:59.501
Let's do it for Dad.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.185
For Dad.

23:01.187 --> 23:06.590
♪ Long to be next to you ♪

23:09.527 --> 23:10.739
HELP!

23:13.592 --> 23:15.459
(Screams)

23:15.576 --> 23:17.701
Where's the threat, Your Highness?
In your room?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.428
James, I'm sorry, no threat.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.832
Why the, er, the sign then?

23:22.030 --> 23:23.215
I'm trying to get a hold of Jasper.

23:23.239 --> 23:24.787
He's giving me the silent treatment

23:24.871 --> 23:26.662
and not responding to my texts.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.459
- Oh, for shit's sake!
- I know.

23:29.545 --> 23:31.850
As impossible as it is to imagine

23:32.108 --> 23:34.912
your supremely eloquent
emoji texts going unanswered,

23:35.201 --> 23:38.100
the palace private cameras
are not a messaging service

23:38.165 --> 23:39.731
for you two.

23:44.119 --> 23:46.022
But could you tell him though?

23:46.170 --> 23:47.436
Oh.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.975
Is there something
Liam's security detail

24:03.018 --> 24:04.445
- can help you with?
- Don't be like that.

24:04.469 --> 24:07.600
I've been trying to apologize
about earlier with Robby.

24:07.834 --> 24:10.780
I just wanted to see how the call went.

24:10.998 --> 24:13.639
Oh, I know. That's so sweet.

24:13.866 --> 24:16.209
I panicked. I didn't have time to decide

24:16.256 --> 24:18.576
how to tell him about us.
But I've thought about it,

24:18.647 --> 24:21.238
and I spoke to Liam,
and I'll just tell him straight away.

24:21.317 --> 24:23.417
I've got nothing to hide.

24:25.267 --> 24:27.412
Okay.

24:28.645 --> 24:31.389
Well, what do I do? What should I say?

24:31.478 --> 24:34.655
Er, well, just be yourself.
I like you, he will too.

24:34.705 --> 24:36.694
- Okay, but which self?
- Hm?

24:36.822 --> 24:39.694
Well, let's start with

I'm sorry, Your Highness.
That was a really bad joke.

24:47.758 --> 24:50.626
An American joke. They're all bad.

about Dad's murderer.

My boyfriend.

25:18.905 --> 25:20.920
Mm, I wanted to introduce you

25:21.069 --> 25:24.436
because I thought that you
should know what's going on.

25:25.631 --> 25:27.373

25:27.810 --> 25:29.176

the hand of the man who

25:49.530 --> 25:51.389
found my father's murderer.

25:51.570 --> 25:54.803
And of course, I have
high standards for my only sister,

25:54.861 --> 25:57.959

26:01.281 --> 26:05.491

able to ensure that

26:15.974 --> 26:17.412

37:03.790 --> 37:07.262
Armed only with a knife,
that belonged to my father,

37:07.910 --> 37:11.310
a small compass and a single flare...

37:11.936 --> 37:14.082

37:14.315 --> 37:17.145
With my watch's homing beacon damaged,

37:17.466 --> 37:20.113
I knew that I couldn't
waste that flare on anything

37:20.138 --> 37:21.934
but an absolute certainty.

37:22.090 --> 37:25.004

first opportunity I had

37:25.036 --> 37:26.730
to be rescued.

37:27.512 --> 37:32.152
And when I saw that blessed
fishing boat turn around...

37:32.882 --> 37:35.395
well, I could almost taste

37:35.446 --> 37:37.652

London Pride on my lips.

37:53.278 --> 37:56.707

three weeks and four days,

37:59.029 --> 38:00.828
did you ever lose hope?

38:01.262 --> 38:02.746
Good question.

38:02.842 --> 38:04.691
Did I ever lose hope?

38:06.673 --> 38:08.551
I can say that when I came to,

38:08.576 --> 38:10.684
I was completely stripped of hope.

38:11.117 --> 38:13.152

38:13.205 --> 38:15.504
when it's pressed against
a wall with nowhere to go.

38:15.708 --> 38:18.379
It doesn't take no for an answer.

38:18.581 --> 38:21.551
And every breath that
I took from that moment

38:21.793 --> 38:24.183
built a new degree of hope.

38:25.527 --> 38:30.047
Until I was completely sure
that I would be back home.

38:36.360 --> 38:39.493
And back with you lot,
asking questions like this.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.659
(Laughter)

38:40.717 --> 38:42.430
So, no, I never lost hope.

38:42.598 --> 38:44.665
Patience, on the other hand, well,

38:44.709 --> 38:46.571
that's a different story.

38:46.859 --> 38:48.977
Let's just say that I, er...

38:49.332 --> 38:51.688
painfully mastered patience.

38:51.946 --> 38:54.446
(Barrage of questions)

38:55.433 --> 38:57.579
For the Queen.
You must have a million emotions.

38:57.604 --> 38:58.954
Can you describe them for us?

38:59.012 --> 39:01.016
Are you worried about King Cyrus?

39:01.070 --> 39:03.196
Given his past and path to the throne,

39:03.228 --> 39:05.962
are you worried about
the transition of power?

39:08.677 --> 39:09.899
No.

39:10.035 --> 39:12.035
He and I have spoken.

39:12.461 --> 39:16.101
He knows his time has come... and gone.

39:17.579 --> 39:20.352
Hah! Fat chance.

39:21.509 --> 39:23.024
Does this mean I'm being disposed of,

39:23.049 --> 39:24.547
right when I've been brought back?

39:24.617 --> 39:28.157
Ssh. You're much prettier
when you don't speak.

39:28.719 --> 39:31.680
And no,
neither of us are going anywhere.

39:32.732 --> 39:35.666
Go and lie back down.
I'll be over shortly.

39:38.651 --> 39:41.149
Nice to have you back, old friend.

39:43.258 --> 39:46.235
I'm back, bitch.

39:51.232 --> 39:53.086
What about you, Princess Eleanor?

39:53.156 --> 39:54.755

40:13.270 --> 40:15.824
<i>I just couldn't be happier right now.</i>

40:16.714 --> 40:18.153
I feel like everything's lining up

40:18.213 --> 40:20.481
exactly like it's supposed to.

40:22.660 --> 40:24.996
<i>(REPORTER) Prince Robert,
how much time will it take you</i>

40:25.074 --> 40:27.762
<i>to recuperate before
getting back into the swing?</i>

40:27.949 --> 40:32.223
<i>(ROBERT) None. I'm home, I'm focused,</i>

40:32.403 --> 40:34.356
<i>I'm ready to lead this kingdom.</i>

40:35.153 --> 40:37.020
<i>I've never been in more control.</i>

40:39.387 --> 40:41.762
<i>And now I'm back in my own room...</i>

40:42.312 --> 40:44.910
<i>and finally back in my own bed...</i>

40:46.508 --> 40:48.542
<i>I'm all set.</i>

40:49.895 --> 40:51.098
<i>(FEMALE REPORTER) Prince Liam,</i>

40:51.160 --> 40:52.504
<i>is there anything you'd like to add</i>

40:52.528 --> 40:54.285
<i>about what you're feeling today?</i>

40:54.504 --> 40:57.817
<i>(LIAM) I can try. Words may fail me.</i>

40:59.157 --> 41:03.473
<i>But consequently,
I've been reprocessing feelings...</i>

41:03.987 --> 41:05.942
<i>attached to loss today.</i>

41:07.164 --> 41:09.298
<i>All of you have felt it.</i>

41:10.832 --> 41:13.909
<i>It's insurmountable when you
lose someone you care about.</i>

41:16.278 --> 41:19.715
I'd have given up everything
to have my brother back.

41:20.324 --> 41:22.473
Thankfully, I didn't have to.

41:23.199 --> 41:25.754
And after all we went
through when we lost Robert,

41:25.999 --> 41:28.569
we feel lucky... and immensely grateful

41:28.605 --> 41:30.638
to have him back with us.

41:33.405 --> 41:35.577
<i>Now let's all take this impossibility</i>

41:35.740 --> 41:37.647
<i>as a renewed sense of purpose.</i>

41:37.788 --> 41:40.827
Let's commit to a new
era for our kingdom.

41:41.639 --> 41:43.139
And let's all hope to look back

41:43.178 --> 41:45.272
on this event's implications as being

41:45.374 --> 41:48.014
more epic than we can ever imagine.

41:49.045 --> 41:53.045
Dare I say, we've only just begun.
