00:07.107 --> 00:09.041
Who's a good little fella?

00:09.109 --> 00:11.168
Hey, where's your brother?

00:11.344 --> 00:13.039
Here he comes!

00:13.680 --> 00:17.081
Shut the... up, Steve! You're scaring him!

01:02.829 --> 01:04.262
I done told you, now.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.924
This Halloween,
you won't like me when I'm angry.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.298
I don't like you ever. Now just hold still.

01:09.369 --> 01:12.031
You're about to be both Hall and Oates.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.970
People ain't gonna get that.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.099
Yeah, you're right. Too inside.

01:16.176 --> 01:19.668
Let me go get the blender.
You can go as the Boston Philharmonic.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.611
I ain't being no boogersnot orchestra.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.148
I'm the Incredible Plum.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.547
No, you're not.

01:24.617 --> 01:25.606
Now, get in there.

01:25.685 --> 01:26.982
All right. You know best.

01:27.053 --> 01:29.613
But just so we're clear, boy,
don't make me angry.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.055
Shut up.
Just let the food ninja do the work.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.217
Shake, unplug that.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.261
Great. Look who just ruined Halloween.

01:35.328 --> 01:38.320
You're like the A-bomb.
Everybody's laughing, having a good time.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.366
Then you show up, boom.
Everything's dead.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.994
Come on out of there, Meatwad.
You're gonna be The Bachelor.

01:44.070 --> 01:47.471
All right!
But I can still be the plum, too, right?

01:47.540 --> 01:48.973
- No!
- You better not say it.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.270
- No.
- I'll get angry.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.243
Of course you can. Shake!

01:52.512 --> 01:54.139
The plum is a bachelor, too, Meatwad.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.843
Yeah. He was so angry
he didn't understand the compromises...

01:57.917 --> 02:00.818
you gotta go through
building a lasting relationship.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.787
He done, like, throw a car at a woman.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.916
Plus, his genitals were purple.

02:05.992 --> 02:07.619
What are you supposed to be, Frylock?

02:07.694 --> 02:10.925
Don't mind me.
I'm just a sailor on shore leave.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.864
From the ship of the damned.

02:16.569 --> 02:17.661
Okay.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.830
You know, "The Ship of the Damned"?

02:19.906 --> 02:22.397
Famous short story about a ship
that had a hole in it?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.534
- No.
- Just go put on your ballerina shoes...

02:24.611 --> 02:27.808
and get the rest of the outfit.
Be who you really are, Dr. Zhivago.

02:27.881 --> 02:28.939
Yeah, you suck.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.448
I'll just go get the candy, okay?

02:30.517 --> 02:31.541
He getting candy.

02:31.618 --> 02:34.086
I got $10 says he's wearing
women's panties under that.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.214
- Under what?
- I know what I said, Meatwad!

02:37.290 --> 02:38.314
- Okay.
- Don't repeat me!

02:38.391 --> 02:39.824
- Okay.
- I'm not a retard like you!

02:39.893 --> 02:40.882
Gracious.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.688
Good one, Frylock.
Which crappy book is this one from?

02:45.765 --> 02:47.027
<i>Onion of Arabia?</i>

02:47.100 --> 02:48.465
Yeah. Onion.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.060
Hey, look at this. Our first trick-or-treater.

02:51.137 --> 02:52.399
- I thought he was you.
- No.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.372
- I'm the haunted sailor from the...
- We know.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.533
We heard where you're from, and it sucks!

02:56.609 --> 02:58.770
I don't think you understand, man.
I live here.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.210
Okay. I get it.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.145
You're Insane Creature Guy.

03:02.215 --> 03:04.308
No. This isn't a costume.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.477
I live in the attic. I'm a monster.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.181
No! Frylock, get the axe!

03:09.255 --> 03:12.247
So, do you have any mail for me?
Willie Nelson?

03:12.325 --> 03:14.793
- Willie Nelson?
- Not "the" Willie Nelson.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.488
But my name is Willie Nelson.

03:16.563 --> 03:20.932
Wait a minute. I think we might have time
to order an axe from a Web site!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.763
- Will we make it?
- That is weird.

03:22.835 --> 03:26.396
Come to think of it, we do occasionally
get mail for a Willie Nelson.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.236
I used to forward it,
but now I just throw it out.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.573
- Sorry.
- Good. Thanks.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.842
This isn't mine. I think I'll throw it out.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.906
That was my window to the world!

03:37.984 --> 03:40.817
Now it's been shattered by the monster.
Pretty scary, right?

03:40.887 --> 03:44.584
No. What's that word that's
the exact opposite of scary?

03:44.657 --> 03:47.091
- Tacos?
- Taco? Where? Get out of my way.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.320
Those are mine! I made them!

03:48.394 --> 03:51.852
Okay, look, the scaring will resume
when I get back to your attic.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.695
- You live in the attic?
- He has said that twice already!

03:54.767 --> 03:57.861
- You're just now getting this?
- There's a monster in the attic?

03:57.937 --> 03:59.268
Yeah.

03:59.339 --> 04:02.934
I was driven here by the villagers
when I was doing 30 in the 25...

04:03.009 --> 04:05.705
and I guess when I say villagers...

04:05.778 --> 04:07.973
it's more like this one guy.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.776
I really didn't know him.

04:09.849 --> 04:13.717
But, you know, I knew him,
but it's not like we were buds or anything.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.777
- You want him to repeat that?
- No, I heard it.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.153
- Thanks for joining us now.
- What's with the razor?

04:18.224 --> 04:21.750
I shave. Once every couple of days.

04:21.894 --> 04:25.125
It's nerve-wracking. It's supposed to be.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.756
- It's not.
- You shave up there?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.460
We wouldn't hear it anyway. I mean...

04:28.534 --> 04:30.263
we have pretty good insulation up there.

04:30.336 --> 04:34.204
I know. It's sweltering. I mean,
do you guys have a fan or something?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.504
I'm just gonna borrow it.
I'm not gonna keep it.

04:36.576 --> 04:40.478
You are the gayest monster
since gay came to gaytown!

04:40.546 --> 04:43.379
Easy! Where's this coming from?

04:43.449 --> 04:47.317
No, let's get down to it.
What I say is very baffling.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.185
You two. We don't want any trouble
here now, okay?

04:50.256 --> 04:52.918
No, I'm with you.
I don't think violence solves anything.

04:52.992 --> 04:56.155
God, you're gay!
You don't think violence solves anything?

04:56.229 --> 05:00.495
- What kind of monster are you?
- Look, I'm pretty hard-core.

05:00.566 --> 05:04.297
I've been known to do a number
on plenty of cats...

05:04.370 --> 05:06.031
Do a number?

05:06.105 --> 05:09.768
Yeah, I bet you do a number.
In your tights on Broadway...

05:09.842 --> 05:14.370
which is where you moved to
after you left Texas Chainsaw Mascara...

05:14.480 --> 05:16.038
where you're from!

05:16.115 --> 05:17.173
What's he talking about?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.980
How much you want to bet me
you couldn't scare jack?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.421
- Carl.
- Who's this, your fricking mother?

05:23.489 --> 05:26.185
No, Carl. It's your neighbor, remember?

05:26.259 --> 05:28.921
Willie Nelson?
I was driven here by the villagers, and...

05:28.995 --> 05:30.519
- Villager...
- Well, the villager...

05:30.596 --> 05:32.029
Yeah, that's a great story.

05:32.098 --> 05:35.033
- See ya.
- All right. Pay up. Let's go.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.295
Hold on.

05:37.603 --> 05:40.197
The shaving. The shaving!

05:40.273 --> 05:43.640
- I'm calling the cops.
- He will do it. I'm out of here, man.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.612
- Then we better go.
- What is this? "The shaving. The shaving".

05:47.714 --> 05:48.840
Get some edge, man.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.748
This has a triple edge,
with special lubricating strip.

05:51.818 --> 05:52.807
This'll do a number.

05:52.885 --> 05:56.116
You want to see how to scare
the neighbor? Check this out.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.053
- What?
- Catch!

05:58.124 --> 06:00.251
- Hi, Carl!
- Get him off!

06:00.326 --> 06:01.759
It's too easy.

06:01.828 --> 06:05.423
- Cool. Can I try that?
- No. Only I can do that.

06:05.631 --> 06:09.590
But I will show you the ways
of a monster. Come.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.671
Now remember, you have no regard
for human life...

06:12.739 --> 06:14.536
most especially women...

06:14.607 --> 06:18.737
because they have the organs
that you wish that you had.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.676
So you want to make a suit from them.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.442
I don't want to make a suit from them...

06:22.515 --> 06:26.144
Listen to me. That's how it's done.
All you concern yourself with is kill.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.188
You got it? None of the side crap,
'cause it's throwing you off.

06:29.255 --> 06:32.019
And who's gonna stop you anyway?
You're immortal.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.252
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.693
Please, and do me another favor:
Lose the shaving.

06:36.763 --> 06:40.563
Monsters don't groom themselves.
They're frigging maniacs!

06:42.335 --> 06:45.236
Okay. Now what's this?

06:45.304 --> 06:49.468
It's John Q. Public.
I'm just walking along the street...

06:49.542 --> 06:53.069
and suddenly a monster pops out
and says...

06:53.646 --> 06:55.443
"What are you doing here?"

06:56.315 --> 06:59.443
Damn it! No!

06:59.519 --> 07:04.218
- Will you read the sheet?
- "Nice head. I think I'll take it".

07:04.290 --> 07:06.349
There we go,
but a little more feeling, okay?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.553
I can't want it for you,
because they'll know.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.619
And wear this sailor's hat, too.

07:10.696 --> 07:14.029
Would you mind, please?
We're working here.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.727
I think the sailor's hat adds a nice...

07:15.802 --> 07:18.794
It's gonna land us one of those
rainbow flags to hang out front.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.135
- Now, get out of here!
- All right, I'm gonna roll.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.504
I'm on this.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.372
Remember, the chain saws are electric...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.537
so you only got about 30 feet to play with.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.945
Now, go! Kill like crazy! Kill them!

07:30.016 --> 07:31.449
"Nice head. I think I'll take it.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.451
"Nice head. I think I'll take it.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.783
"Nice head. I think... " Oh, crap!

07:35.855 --> 07:38.824
- What? What do you want?
- Yeah, what do you want?

07:39.725 --> 07:40.987
What are you doing here?

07:41.060 --> 07:43.051
I live here, ass...

07:43.129 --> 07:45.097
- Yeah, I know.
- And I'm just visiting.

07:45.164 --> 07:48.133
You didn't get any of my mail by mistake,
did you?

07:48.234 --> 07:49.929
- Willie Nelson?
- Hang on. Let me look.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.196
Eat me.

07:51.370 --> 07:55.170
If it shows up, bring it over. If you dare.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.872
- God, I suck.
- Okay, sit down. Tell me.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.573
How did it go?
You told them your name, right?

08:01.948 --> 08:04.542
Yeah. Blood Feast Island Man.
Just like you said.

08:04.617 --> 08:07.518
And? What else? Come on, don't be shy.

08:07.587 --> 08:11.819
Of course Blood Feast Island Man
does thirst for blood.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.553
Yes. The thirst is part of his pain...

08:14.627 --> 08:17.255
- because the devil had sex with a dog...
- Yeah.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.127
- ... and your mother...
- I know about that.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.223
- ... was that very dog.
- Yeah, I know.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.669
And as you know, because you wrote it,
I do feel the need to kill again.

08:25.738 --> 08:26.966
You crave it.

08:27.039 --> 08:30.475
And I guess our friend Carl
knows that pretty well...

08:30.743 --> 08:32.734
by now. You know what I mean?

08:32.812 --> 08:34.609
Yeah, pretty much.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.443
I think he got the point,
you know what I mean?

08:37.783 --> 08:41.684
- I'll get it. You sit there.
- Here, have a taste.

08:41.754 --> 08:44.484
- No! Don't touch me!
- How you doing?

08:44.557 --> 08:47.082
- I'm going back to the attic.
- I'm going back next door.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.251
He's got AC over there.

08:48.327 --> 08:53.162
You didn't do jack, did you?
Blood Feast Island Pansy!

08:53.232 --> 08:56.963
Which is your new name
until you earn the right to kill.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.172
Ring it again.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.310
Come on out, Carl! Touch the handle!

09:05.645 --> 09:08.580
Come on! We're not gonna do anything!

09:08.915 --> 09:13.181
- Ring it again. He's in there.
- Are we trying to kill him or scare him?

09:13.252 --> 09:16.187
Killing is scary. Come on, it's Halloween.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.189
I don't know if I want to be a part of this.

09:18.257 --> 09:22.193
Too late. This is your work.
It's got your name all over it.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.259
Enough of this... Fine. Thanks, Carl.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.299
We didn't want you to come out anyway!

09:27.366 --> 09:30.961
<i>Why don't you stay in there and have
a little more drinky-drinky on me?</i>

09:31.037 --> 09:32.061
Lower the blood.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.231
Which lever is it?
There's, like, three of them.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.970
- I said: do it!
- Okay, I got it.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.012
- You hear me?
- Hell, yeah!

09:45.084 --> 09:48.952
- Yeah, that was frigging awesome!
- Yeah. Give me some skin!

09:49.021 --> 09:50.181
No, thank you.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.986
I think I got enough of your skin
on my face here.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.688
Come on, boy. I know where he lives.
We gonna scare him good.

09:56.796 --> 10:00.288
Okay, let's review. What happened?

10:00.533 --> 10:02.933
We did it, Guy. High five.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.731
All right. Over here, please.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.965
You should have seen his face.
You did see it.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.438
- You were there.
- No, I did.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.998
And I guess my eyes rolled back
into my head...

10:11.077 --> 10:14.240
once it reached
the height of demonification.

10:14.313 --> 10:17.009
You're right. I looked over.
That's what you were doing.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.916
Yeah, that's typical
with dark powers of this nature...

10:19.986 --> 10:23.217
and Carl is freaking right now.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.588
