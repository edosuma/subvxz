WEBVTT

00:04.491 --> 00:07.260
I must say, Penny,
this is great fun.

00:07.261 --> 00:08.795
Glad you're
enjoying yourself.

00:08.796 --> 00:11.464
Until I met you and Bernadette,
my trips to the bathroom

00:11.465 --> 00:14.267
had been entirely focused
on elimination.

00:14.268 --> 00:17.704
Now they have a delightful
social aspect.

00:17.705 --> 00:19.439
Amy, you must've been
in the bathroom

00:19.440 --> 00:20.807
with other women before.

00:20.808 --> 00:24.310
Of course I have.

00:24.311 --> 00:26.496
But they were strangers
and seemed off-put

00:26.497 --> 00:29.816
when I engaged in friendly
stall-to-stall chit-chat.

00:29.817 --> 00:31.984
Some women don't
like to get chummy

00:31.985 --> 00:34.120
when their panties are down.

00:34.121 --> 00:37.257
You okay in there, bestie?

00:37.258 --> 00:38.491
I'm fine...

00:38.492 --> 00:40.026
The reason I ask is
that many people

00:40.027 --> 00:41.561
experience bladder shyness;

00:41.562 --> 00:43.329
the inability to pass uri...

00:43.330 --> 00:45.498
Yeah, I said I'm fine.
Stop talking to me.

00:45.499 --> 00:47.901
She always this crabby
when she urinates?

00:47.902 --> 00:50.103
We're really not that close.

00:50.104 --> 00:53.106
Screw it.
I'll go later.

00:53.107 --> 00:55.541
And I'll be right
by your side.

00:57.895 --> 00:59.412
Did I tell you
Priya invited

00:59.413 --> 01:01.581
me and Howard to have dinner
with her and Leonard?

01:01.582 --> 01:03.182
Oh, that's nice.

01:03.183 --> 01:05.051
No, it's not.

01:05.052 --> 01:06.552
It's a strategic maneuver.

01:06.553 --> 01:09.188
Leonard's new girlfriend is
testing Bernadette's loyalty

01:09.189 --> 01:10.390
to you and the group.

01:10.391 --> 01:12.358
That bitch is crafty.

01:14.795 --> 01:17.029
- You think?
- Of course.

01:17.030 --> 01:19.332
How does the cheetah attack
a herd of wildebeests?

01:19.333 --> 01:21.501
By going after
its weakest member.

01:22.503 --> 01:25.772
Well, what makes me
the weakest member?

01:25.773 --> 01:29.976
Your trusting nature coupled
with your teeny-tiny body.

01:29.977 --> 01:32.578
You wouldn't last a minute
on the Serengeti.

01:32.579 --> 01:35.064
Okay, Amy,
you're being silly.

01:35.065 --> 01:37.183
I'm not concerned about
who hangs out with who.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.685
And I certainly
don't have a problem

01:38.686 --> 01:41.187
with Leonard's new girlfriend
who wears way too much makeup.

01:42.323 --> 01:45.024
Ooh, these are cute.

01:45.025 --> 01:46.259
Of course if I buy them,

01:46.260 --> 01:49.362
I'll have to rent
my womb out to a gay couple.

01:51.598 --> 01:53.750
It doesn't matter. I'm going to
tell her we can't make it.

01:53.751 --> 01:55.568
Oh, no. You <i>have</i> to go.

01:55.569 --> 01:56.753
I don't understand.

01:56.754 --> 01:59.672
I thought I was
a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

01:59.673 --> 02:03.142
You are-- with hair
that smells like strawberries.

02:03.143 --> 02:05.178
And we're going to use that
to our advantage.

02:05.179 --> 02:06.546
Wait. What are you
talking about?

02:06.547 --> 02:08.931
By accepting the invitation,
Bernadette becomes

02:08.931 --> 02:10.984
a double agent
inside the enemy camp.

02:10.985 --> 02:12.802
She could ferret out
Priya's tactics,

02:12.803 --> 02:14.053
identify her weaknesses

02:14.054 --> 02:16.105
and feed her false
information, such as:

02:16.106 --> 02:20.259
Leonard's no stranger
to back-alley cockfights.

02:20.260 --> 02:22.261
I don't know.
I'm not a very good liar.

02:22.262 --> 02:25.598
They kind of whup that
out of you in Catholic school.

02:25.599 --> 02:27.617
Don't worry.
I'll teach you.

02:27.618 --> 02:28.985
I did two years
of Cub Scouts

02:28.986 --> 02:30.970
before they found
out I was a girl.

02:33.173 --> 02:35.074
Okay, I don't
know you people.

02:35.075 --> 02:36.642
I'm just an innocent
woman wondering

02:36.643 --> 02:39.579
if this shoe store will
take my Texaco card.

02:41.048 --> 02:43.533
How do you feel about
concealing a recording device

02:43.534 --> 02:46.319
in the cleavage of
your ample bosom?

02:46.320 --> 02:49.856
I don't want anything
in my ample bosom.

02:49.857 --> 02:53.459
Come on, Strawberries.
Take one for the team.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.080
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

03:22.092 --> 03:24.694
- Okay, see you later.
- Good news.

03:24.695 --> 03:28.014
I finally have a handle on my
idea for three-person chess.

03:29.349 --> 03:32.201
That is good news. Bye.

03:32.202 --> 03:33.369
Uh, do you know
how I solved

03:33.370 --> 03:36.138
the balanced center
combat-area problem?

03:36.139 --> 03:37.490
Five words:

03:37.491 --> 03:41.744
transitional quadrilateral
to triangular tessellation.

03:42.612 --> 03:44.880
That... that's brilliant.

03:44.881 --> 03:46.916
It's what I do.

03:47.584 --> 03:49.168
But wait, there's more.

03:49.169 --> 03:52.121
I also invented
two new chess pieces.

03:52.122 --> 03:55.324
The serpent...
and the old woman.

03:57.494 --> 03:59.929
Okay, now I have to ask.
What do they do?

03:59.930 --> 04:02.965
When the serpent slithers
to an opposing player's piece,

04:02.966 --> 04:05.034
that piece
is considered poisoned

04:05.035 --> 04:08.304
and will die
after two more moves.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.041
All right.

04:12.042 --> 04:15.845
Unless... it gets to
the old woman in time,

04:15.846 --> 04:18.514
in which case
she sucks out the poison,

04:18.515 --> 04:21.784
turning her into
the Grand Empress:

04:24.888 --> 04:26.388
a piece combining the power

04:26.389 --> 04:30.025
of the knight, queen
and serpent.

04:30.026 --> 04:31.427
Elegant.

04:31.428 --> 04:33.996
That's because it's simple.

04:35.899 --> 04:37.900
Okay, well, I look forward
to playing with you.

04:37.901 --> 04:39.135
And...

04:39.136 --> 04:40.169
And what?

04:40.170 --> 04:42.671
And a third person.

04:42.672 --> 04:45.191
It's three-person chess.

04:45.192 --> 04:47.176
I must say,
ever since you started

04:47.177 --> 04:51.480
having regular intercourse, your
mind has lost its keen edge.

04:52.365 --> 04:54.517
You should reflect on that.

04:54.518 --> 04:57.453
Excuse me, but Einstein had
a pretty busy sex life.

04:57.454 --> 05:01.857
Yes, and he never unified
gravity with the other forces.

05:01.858 --> 05:03.959
If he hadn't been
such a hound dog,

05:03.960 --> 05:05.828
we'd all have time machines.

05:05.829 --> 05:08.297
Got it. Bye.

05:08.298 --> 05:10.166
You know I'm right.

05:11.935 --> 05:15.204
I think he's getting worse.

05:15.205 --> 05:18.073
Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

05:24.648 --> 05:26.215
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:26.216 --> 05:28.350
I'm just breaking in
some new shoes.

05:28.351 --> 05:30.219
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.403
Did you know that women
wear high heels

05:31.404 --> 05:33.989
to make the buttocks
and breasts more prominent?

05:33.990 --> 05:35.825
Hadn't really thought about it.

05:35.826 --> 05:37.226
Look.

05:40.397 --> 05:44.500
Uh, sure. Very... prominent.

05:44.501 --> 05:47.269
Please, Leonard, don't leer,
you have a girlfriend.

05:48.071 --> 05:50.272
- Sorry.
- So, are you off to dinner

05:50.273 --> 05:51.674
with Priya, Howard
and Bernadette?

05:51.675 --> 05:52.675
Yeah. How did you know?

05:52.676 --> 05:53.709
I heard it at the mall,

05:53.710 --> 05:55.177
when I was shopping
with my girlfriends,

05:55.178 --> 05:57.813
'cause, you know,
that's kind of my life now.

05:58.982 --> 06:00.049
Have a good night.

06:00.050 --> 06:02.218
Try not to ogle my caboose
as I walk away.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.962
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

06:13.897 --> 06:16.498
Hey, Raj, will you
be joining us for dinner?

06:16.499 --> 06:18.934
The lonely guy
and the two happy couples?

06:18.935 --> 06:20.736
I'd rather get a prostate exam

06:20.737 --> 06:24.373
from a leper who walks away
with nine fingers.

06:24.374 --> 06:28.110
Oh, would you please stop
feeling sorry for yourself?

06:28.111 --> 06:31.463
I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.

06:31.464 --> 06:34.250
Just like I'm the only one
who'll have sex with me.

06:34.251 --> 06:37.169
Really? In front
of your sister?

06:37.170 --> 06:41.156
We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.

06:41.157 --> 06:43.976
Excuse me. I'm going to go
wander the streets alone.

06:43.977 --> 06:46.095
Invisible, unwanted and unloved;

06:46.096 --> 06:49.331
a pathetic shadow
in a city with no heart.

06:52.168 --> 06:54.970
I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.

06:57.841 --> 07:01.777
I don't understand. Is this
a way to break in new shoes?

07:01.778 --> 07:04.213
No. Once these puppies
touch the ground

07:04.214 --> 07:05.447
they're mine,
and I'll have to wear them

07:05.448 --> 07:07.016
walking up and down
Hollywood Boulevard

07:07.017 --> 07:09.118
in order to pay them off.

07:11.154 --> 07:14.189
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

07:14.190 --> 07:17.659
Good news: the wildebeest
is in the curry.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.128
The what?

07:19.129 --> 07:21.997
Bernadette is with
Priya and Leonard.

07:21.998 --> 07:24.466
Message received.

07:24.467 --> 07:28.671
Commence operation
"Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."

07:30.390 --> 07:32.024
Hey. Seriously?

07:32.025 --> 07:34.710
Didn't you get enough of this
cliquey crap in high school?

07:34.711 --> 07:36.745
I wish. A clique
requires friends.

07:36.746 --> 07:39.281
- I didn't have any.
- None?

07:39.282 --> 07:41.583
I used to take my lunch
down to the maintenance room

07:41.584 --> 07:43.786
and eat with the janitor.

07:43.787 --> 07:46.255
It was nice until his wife
called me a <i>puta</i>

07:46.256 --> 07:47.690
and made me stop.

07:50.493 --> 07:53.429
Hang on.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.831
It's the wildebeest.

07:55.832 --> 07:58.500
Priya just made a snide comment
about your acting career.

07:58.501 --> 08:00.369
W-What the hell did she say?

08:00.370 --> 08:02.438
She thinks it's cool
you're following your dream,

08:02.439 --> 08:04.340
no matter what.

08:04.341 --> 08:07.776
That bitch!

08:07.777 --> 08:10.512
How do you want
to handle it?

08:10.513 --> 08:12.348
Um, okay.

08:12.349 --> 08:15.317
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya
that I'm on my way to Prague

08:15.318 --> 08:17.853
to shoot a movie
with Angelina Jolie.

08:17.854 --> 08:19.555
Got it.

08:19.556 --> 08:22.391
Is it going
to be in 3-D?

08:22.392 --> 08:24.226
What? I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

08:24.227 --> 08:25.627
I'm gonna say 3-D.

08:25.628 --> 08:28.430
That'll let her know
the studio has faith in it.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.868
You're kidding. 3-D?

08:34.070 --> 08:36.705
That's what I hear.

08:36.706 --> 08:39.140
Then the studio
must have real faith in it.

08:41.077 --> 08:43.245
Wonder why she
didn't <i>tell</i> me.

08:43.246 --> 08:45.714
Have you been spending time
with your ex-girlfriend?

08:45.715 --> 08:47.716
No...

08:47.717 --> 08:50.285
Then why are you surprised
she didn't tell you?

08:50.286 --> 08:53.856
Well, it's not as much
"surprised" as

08:53.857 --> 08:57.726
you know...
uh... the other thing.

08:58.661 --> 09:00.829
What other thing?

09:00.830 --> 09:04.833
Well, if you... uh...

09:04.834 --> 09:07.803
I don't... oh...

09:07.804 --> 09:09.371
What's the word I'm looking for?

09:09.372 --> 09:12.107
I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.

09:14.411 --> 09:17.579
She's also dating an astronaut.

09:18.515 --> 09:21.083
Wow. That's very impressive.

09:21.084 --> 09:24.753
Yeah. But Leonard's
impressive, too.

09:28.425 --> 09:30.092
Thank you.

09:30.994 --> 09:33.262
"Befuddled."

09:33.263 --> 09:36.832
The word I was looking for
was "befuddled."

09:41.938 --> 09:46.208
Knight to old woman...

09:47.710 --> 09:51.213
six-and-a-third.

09:57.053 --> 10:00.322
Brilliant move.

10:04.260 --> 10:07.062
Thank you.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.901
Will the two of you excuse me?

10:17.774 --> 10:20.642
I need a hug.

10:21.511 --> 10:23.028
Sorry, I have company.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.182
Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

10:32.183 --> 10:35.485
I don't want to hug you.

10:35.486 --> 10:36.853
I don't want to
hug you, either.

10:36.854 --> 10:38.221
I was just
feeling blue.

10:38.222 --> 10:41.058
Blue, as in depressed.

10:41.059 --> 10:43.193
Well, not so much
depressed as lonely.

10:43.194 --> 10:46.163
I don't know what
color lonely is.

10:46.164 --> 10:48.198
- What?
- Red is angry;

10:48.199 --> 10:49.800
yellow is frightened;

10:49.801 --> 10:53.036
green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.

10:53.037 --> 10:56.206
Perhaps we can assign
a color to lonely.

10:56.207 --> 11:00.210
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.213
All right. Come in.

11:03.214 --> 11:05.882
You look positively
orange with loneliness.

11:07.352 --> 11:10.654
No, I don't see that
catching on at all.

11:10.655 --> 11:11.855
What are you doing?

11:11.856 --> 11:13.757
I'm working on my
three-person chess game.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.392
Oh, cool. Can I play?

11:17.528 --> 11:20.597
It's three-person chess.

11:20.598 --> 11:22.299
Did you bring a friend?

11:22.300 --> 11:23.900
No.

11:23.901 --> 11:26.403
Then as a mental exercise
I invite you

11:26.404 --> 11:31.274
to figure out why the two of us
can't play three-person chess.

11:32.243 --> 11:35.679
Can you believe this guy?

11:37.982 --> 11:39.416
Social protocol does, however,

11:39.417 --> 11:41.084
require me to bring you
a hot beverage

11:41.085 --> 11:42.352
in your time of need.

11:42.353 --> 11:43.587
No, thank you. I'm fine.

11:43.588 --> 11:45.255
It's not optional.

11:46.290 --> 11:49.959
We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.930
I, uh, I guess you're probably
wondering what's got me down.

11:53.931 --> 11:55.649
Actually, I was wondering

11:55.650 --> 11:57.768
if I could add
a third new chess piece.

11:57.769 --> 12:01.321
How do you think people
would feel about Prince Joey--

12:01.322 --> 12:04.975
the king's feeble-minded
but well-meaning cousin?

12:04.976 --> 12:06.676
I'm going to be 30 years old,

12:06.677 --> 12:08.779
and I have no one in my life
to love me.

12:08.780 --> 12:11.448
I'm such a basket case, I can't
even talk to a woman

12:11.449 --> 12:13.483
without having alcohol
in my body.

12:13.484 --> 12:16.286
The fun thing about
Prince Joey

12:16.287 --> 12:20.123
is every time he moves,
there's a one-in-five chance

12:20.124 --> 12:21.758
he'll kill himself.

12:23.194 --> 12:25.195
Sheldon, listen to me.

12:25.196 --> 12:27.798
I have a big decision to make,
and I'm scared.

12:27.799 --> 12:30.767
Yellow. Go ahead.

12:30.768 --> 12:32.219
A friend at the School
of Pharmacology

12:32.220 --> 12:33.937
gave me these new pills
they're testing.

12:33.938 --> 12:35.305
He says it's
the next big thing

12:35.306 --> 12:36.706
for social anxiety disorder.

12:36.707 --> 12:39.076
Fascinating.
What's in it?

12:39.077 --> 12:40.510
I'm not sure.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.813
Some sort of beta-blocker
attached to a molecule

12:42.814 --> 12:45.816
extracted from
the urine of cows.

12:45.817 --> 12:47.951
I like cows.

12:47.952 --> 12:49.152
That's not the point.

12:49.153 --> 12:51.822
It was its own
point. Go on.

12:51.823 --> 12:53.457
I'm a scientist.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.792
My ability to think
is my bread and butter.

12:55.793 --> 12:57.627
I'm afraid if I take this,
I might lose

12:57.628 --> 13:01.531
that special, unique something that
makes me so successful in my field.

13:01.532 --> 13:05.034
Rajesh, I've had
the privilege

13:05.035 --> 13:08.038
of working alongside
you for many years.

13:08.039 --> 13:12.242
My recommendation is that you
gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

13:17.982 --> 13:21.084
Okay, I'm still trying
to work this out.

13:21.085 --> 13:24.054
How did Penny meet an astronaut?

13:24.055 --> 13:25.021
I don't know.

13:25.022 --> 13:28.375
The regular way
people meet astronauts.

13:28.376 --> 13:31.128
Most of those
guys live in Texas.

13:31.129 --> 13:33.930
Obviously, this one doesn't.

13:35.066 --> 13:36.266
Okay.

13:36.267 --> 13:38.168
Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.

13:38.169 --> 13:40.604
People meet, Howard.
God!

13:40.605 --> 13:43.073
Fine.

13:43.074 --> 13:44.374
You've met lots of astronauts,

13:44.375 --> 13:46.576
and I've never grilled you
about that.

13:46.577 --> 13:49.112
I'd thank you to extend me
the same courtesy.

13:51.015 --> 13:53.850
I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.

13:53.851 --> 13:57.454
I still can't get over the fact
that she got a big movie part.

13:57.455 --> 14:02.325
Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's
up to, 'cause I don't.

14:02.326 --> 14:05.762
Maybe that's where she met
the astronaut, all right?

14:05.763 --> 14:07.731
I'm sorry. What would an
astronaut be doing

14:07.732 --> 14:09.399
working on a movie?

14:09.400 --> 14:12.302
He's a consultant.

14:12.303 --> 14:16.122
I thought the movie was
about 18th-century Vienna.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.958
He can't have a hobby?!

14:20.244 --> 14:23.129
Excuse me, I have to pee.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.582
Or is that
implausible, as well?!

14:28.986 --> 14:32.189
It's nice to have another
couple to hang with, isn't it?

14:34.308 --> 14:36.426
All right, guys,
you have to go back.

14:36.427 --> 14:37.744
I can't afford you.

14:37.745 --> 14:41.131
No, don't send
us away; we love you.

14:43.034 --> 14:46.803
I love you, too,
but you cost more than my rent.

14:46.804 --> 14:49.806
But, Penny,
you look so good in us.

14:49.807 --> 14:52.192
Damn it, the shoes are right.

14:52.193 --> 14:56.613
Good golly, Penny,
your whimsy is boundless.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.652
What do you got for me,
wildebeest?

15:02.653 --> 15:04.688
I think they're on to me.

15:04.689 --> 15:06.957
The story's starting
to fall apart.

15:06.958 --> 15:08.959
Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.227
We may have
to kill her.

15:10.228 --> 15:13.463
Bernadette, I'm putting
you on speakerphone.

15:13.464 --> 15:15.398
Where are you now?

15:15.399 --> 15:16.766
In the bathroom.

15:16.767 --> 15:20.503
Oh, look at this, another one of
our classic bathroom gabfests.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.772
What's the problem?

15:22.773 --> 15:24.241
They're just asking me

15:24.242 --> 15:26.076
all sorts of questions
I can't answer.

15:26.077 --> 15:28.078
Just change the subject.

15:28.079 --> 15:30.080
I suppose I could get them back
to talking about Leonard

15:30.081 --> 15:31.815
going to India
to meet Priya's parents.

15:31.816 --> 15:33.266
What?!

15:33.267 --> 15:35.869
They said something about
going there this summer.

15:35.870 --> 15:37.954
What, are they getting engaged?

15:37.955 --> 15:40.890
I don't know. I was too busy
covering my heinie

15:40.891 --> 15:43.393
on Amy's stupid
astronaut story!

15:43.394 --> 15:45.729
What astronaut story?

15:45.730 --> 15:48.298
You texted me Penny's
dating an astronaut.

15:48.299 --> 15:50.267
I texted "architect."
That's amusing.

15:50.268 --> 15:53.136
Auto-correct
must've changed it.

15:53.137 --> 15:56.873
Yeah, it's hysterical.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.476
All right, look, just forget
about the astronaut.

15:59.477 --> 16:02.512
Architect. Where would you
have met an astronaut?

16:04.048 --> 16:06.549
Look, just find out what's up
with this trip to India.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.418
I don't want
to do this anymore!

16:08.419 --> 16:09.452
Don't you quit on us!

16:10.655 --> 16:11.955
Bernie, you okay?

16:11.956 --> 16:14.724
It was an architect!

16:16.827 --> 16:18.945
Thank you for coming
with me, Sheldon.

16:18.946 --> 16:19.996
You're a good friend.

16:19.997 --> 16:21.564
I'm glad you think so.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.667
That's what I
strive to emulate.

16:23.668 --> 16:27.954
Okay, let's see
if this drug works.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.074

16:36.180 --> 16:37.781
Can I help you?

16:43.587 --> 16:47.307
Forgive me for staring,
but you're very beautiful.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.598
Thank you.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.434
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?

16:57.435 --> 16:58.601
India.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.303
Oh, cool.
I've always wanted to go there.

17:00.304 --> 17:01.771
It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.073
May I join you?

17:03.074 --> 17:06.576
Uh, okay, sure.
Why not?

17:06.577 --> 17:08.411
My name is Dr. Rajesh
Koothrappali,

17:08.412 --> 17:09.907
and this is my friend
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

17:09.933 --> 17:10.747
Hi.

17:10.748 --> 17:12.682
There's no need
to interact with me.

17:12.683 --> 17:15.551
I'm just here to observe.

17:15.553 --> 17:17.420
What's he
observing?

17:17.421 --> 17:19.356
We're scientists.
We observe everything.

17:19.357 --> 17:20.589
Here, go buy yourself a scone.

17:20.590 --> 17:23.291
All right.

17:24.729 --> 17:26.930
- And what is your name?
- Angela.

17:26.931 --> 17:30.100
Oh, derived from the word
"angel." Appropriate.

17:30.101 --> 17:32.402
You're cute.

17:32.403 --> 17:34.337
I'd like to buy a scone.

17:34.338 --> 17:35.672
Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.

17:35.673 --> 17:36.773
We have muffins.

17:36.774 --> 17:38.375
They sound delicious,

17:38.376 --> 17:41.177
but this money
is earmarked for scones.

17:41.178 --> 17:43.163
What are
you doing?!

17:43.164 --> 17:44.948
Oh, just getting comfortable.

17:44.949 --> 17:49.119
So how long have you
lived in Los Angeles?

17:49.120 --> 17:50.170
I...

17:50.171 --> 17:51.421
They were out of scones.

17:51.422 --> 17:52.672
Sheldon, I'm talking to someone.

17:52.673 --> 17:53.690
You're being rude.

17:53.691 --> 17:55.725
I'll bet you're an actress.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.127
If not, you should be.

17:57.128 --> 17:59.129
You have a very expressive face.

17:59.130 --> 18:00.563
Oh, my God.

18:00.564 --> 18:02.716
Wait, where are you going?

18:02.717 --> 18:04.184
We were doing so well.

18:04.185 --> 18:07.637
She never even got
to see my penis.

18:08.939 --> 18:11.307
Ta-da!

18:18.382 --> 18:20.683
Who wants some
more coffee?

18:20.684 --> 18:22.185
Thanks, yeah.
Sure.

18:22.186 --> 18:23.987
Let me help you.

18:25.539 --> 18:28.591
Nice to see that the gals
are getting along.

18:28.592 --> 18:30.660
"Gals"?

18:30.661 --> 18:32.996
Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

18:34.365 --> 18:36.166
This trip to India
sounds fun.

18:36.167 --> 18:37.600
Yeah, I think it will be.

18:37.601 --> 18:40.537
Are you concerned your parents
might not approve of Leonard?

18:40.538 --> 18:42.272
A little.

18:42.273 --> 18:44.174
They're very old-fashioned.

18:44.175 --> 18:45.742
Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

18:45.743 --> 18:47.944
It's not like you guys
are getting engaged, right?

18:50.080 --> 18:53.116
Oh, God, no.
We're not there yet.

18:53.117 --> 18:55.952
Not engaged.
Very interesting.

18:55.953 --> 18:57.320
I have to tinkle.

18:57.321 --> 18:59.255
You've been in there
a lot tonight. Are you okay?

18:59.256 --> 19:02.792
Yes.
Are you writing a book?

19:02.793 --> 19:04.928
Why are you getting upset?

19:04.929 --> 19:07.597
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.

19:07.598 --> 19:09.899
What's up with you?

19:12.436 --> 19:14.270
Bernadette?

19:15.172 --> 19:17.607
I can't do this anymore!

19:17.608 --> 19:19.742
I'm a good girl!

19:19.743 --> 19:22.078
I went to Catholic school!

19:23.113 --> 19:25.081
Okay, well, it's getting late.

19:25.082 --> 19:28.518
This was terrific.

19:28.519 --> 19:30.186
You win.

19:30.187 --> 19:32.088
Bernie?

19:34.983 --> 19:39.053
I think the word you're
looking for is "befuddled."

19:44.885 --> 19:51.157
My catapult flings my bishop

19:51.158 --> 19:55.461
to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.263
Nice.

19:57.264 --> 20:01.868
Okay, rook to transporter pad.

20:01.869 --> 20:05.071
And he comes out at...

20:06.874 --> 20:10.159
...Leonard's Queen's Bishop
five-and-a-third.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.311
Check on Leonard.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.715
Hang on.

20:15.716 --> 20:19.986
When is my pawn allowed
to use the golf cart?

20:19.987 --> 20:21.804
When it's done charging.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.689
Or you land on
the time machine.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.092
Obviously.

20:26.093 --> 20:28.861
Oh, oh...

20:28.862 --> 20:32.615
Beekeeper to King 12.

20:32.616 --> 20:37.670
I capture your pope
and release the swarm.

20:38.939 --> 20:41.174
Checkmate on Sheldon.

20:41.175 --> 20:45.611
I knew I should've given
my pope the jet pack.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.846
Hey, I've got winners.
