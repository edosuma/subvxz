00:08.400 --> 00:12.700
Well, gosh, what'd I just find
in my pocket?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.900
Is that tri-tip with peanut butter?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.800
It is.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.800
DAPHNE:
Mm. No luck?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.100
He's definitely
coming down with something.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.200
Yeah. Well, I guess
I'm gonna have to eat these myself.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.100
Good idea. Reverse psychology.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.100
What do you mean?

00:32.900 --> 00:35.600
Well, Joe has found the source
of the leak in my ceiling.

00:35.900 --> 00:38.500
It is Cam Winston's brand-new
washing machine.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.600
By Godfrey,
this time he's gone too far.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.600
As if his noise and noxious presence
at the condo meetings

00:44.900 --> 00:45.900
weren't bad enough.

00:46.100 --> 00:50.300
Have you ever heard of anything
more fury inspiring?

00:50.700 --> 00:51.600
I certainly have not.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.000
Imagine the cheek of the man
installing an illegal washer-dryer.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.900
Oh, they're not illegal.
A lot of the units have them.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.400
You guys have a hook-up in the hall
closet where you keep all those hats.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.500
First of all, I had completely forgotten
about the hook-up.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.600
Second of all, I believe the Homburg
is poised for a comeback.

01:10.900 --> 01:14.000
And third,
we have a more immediate problem

01:14.300 --> 01:16.800
in the form of the evil waters
of Cam Winston.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.300
Yeah, about that. Maybe you could ask
Mr. Winston to not use the machine

01:20.500 --> 01:21.800
until we get that leak patched.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.500
Wrong! We've got
to teach Cam a lesson

01:23.700 --> 01:25.300
and shut his water off right now.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.300
That's, uh, not our standard
operating procedure.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.800
Well, I could compensate you
for your pains.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.100
I gotta go all the way down
to the basement.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.700
Perhaps this will help persuade you.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.900
Might get me as far as 6.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

01:53.400 --> 01:55.500
Hello, all.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.600
It's called a Segway.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.900
My friend Raul at the university
is doing an experiment

02:06.200 --> 02:07.900
on the psychological effects
of technology,

02:08.100 --> 02:10.900
- and he asked me to ride it around.
- Well, how do you like it?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.900
Walking is but a distant memory.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.600
Better yet, I can redirect
the unused energy to other pursuits

02:17.900 --> 02:20.500
such as playing squash
or lovemaking.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.400
Oh, Niles.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.600
I'm sorry, I'd love to stay and gawk,
but I'm at war. Come, Joe.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.900
- What was that about?
- Oh, Cam Winston.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.000
Hey, can I have a ride on that thing?

02:34.300 --> 02:37.400
Nothing would please me more.
But no.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.300
One of the conditions
of the experiment

02:42.500 --> 02:44.200
is that I can't share the Segway
with anyone.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.900
Not even you, Daphne. I'm sorry.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.800
I can't believe you agreed to that.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.400
Well, it was damned difficult,
let me tell you.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.800
But I'll make a note of your
disappointment in my daily write-up.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

Well, I know we can't ride it,
but there's a poor sick little dog here...

02:58.400 --> 03:00.300
Dad, again, saying no

03:00.600 --> 03:03.000
is one of the prices
we are all paying for science.

Now, who wants a Fudgsicle?

- Hello, Mr. Winston.
- Hey, Cam, come on in.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.300
Is Frasier at home?

03:15.600 --> 03:19.700
Someone has shut off my water,
and I suspect his hand is at the spigot.

03:20.100 --> 03:23.400
Oh, jeez,
that doesn't sound like Fras.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.300
Then you don't know
what he's capable of.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.300
What's the matter with your dog?
He looks a little glassy-eyed.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.300
He's got a bug.
I gotta take him to the vet.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.700
Oh, well, my mother's a vet,

03:32.900 --> 03:34.300
and she happens to be
staying with me.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.300
I'm sure she wouldn't mind
taking a look, even if it is Frasier's dog.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.400
Oh, no, he's mine.
Frasier can't stand him.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.300
Yeah, when he's healthy,
he jumps on Dr. Crane's bed,

03:42.600 --> 03:44.800
drools on his pillow,
chews on his slippers.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.600
Really?

03:47.900 --> 03:50.000
We gotta get this little rascal
back up on his feet.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.800
[LAUGHING]

03:55.200 --> 03:58.800
I've done some calculating,
and in the last nine years,

03:59.200 --> 04:03.900
I've carried 2.8 tons of laundry
approximately 106.4 miles

04:04.200 --> 04:05.700
back and forth to the basement.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.800
That's the same as carrying an SUV
on my back to Canada.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.100
Maybe we should ask him
to buy a washer-dryer.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.400
DAPHNE:
Oh, there's an idea.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.200
I was gonna suggest
moving the apartment

closer to the laundry room.

- He looks good.

Well, Eddie's tough.
Plus, the smartest dog ever.

were the smartest dogs.

much exposure to dogs.

having a vet right here in the building.

It's only temporary.

on my house.

a few weeks. Then Cam found out.

new bay windows

more serious. A lot more serious.

what you're talking about.

reduced to a single argyle.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.600
Nor is this the only example.

would have noticed

11:48.900 --> 11:52.700
that I left the apartment
wearing two shades of black.

Explanation, please.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.100
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.200
I'm forced
to do the laundry downstairs,

12:01.500 --> 12:04.800
and I guess your socks are just
too tempting to the neighbours.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.200
Of course, you're welcome to go
down there yourself and stand guard.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.000
I see.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.200
And if we had our own
washer-dryer,

there would be
no more lost socks.

FRASIER: I'm fine.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.100
You seem like you've been
in a lousy mood lately.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.200
It's just that they put
soymilk in my latte.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.900
I don't like soymilk.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.500
If it doesn't come from a teat
or an udder, it isn't milk.

Oh, terrific.

Here comes Niles on his fabulous

How are things
back in the twentieth century?

13:13.300 --> 13:16.600
- Wow, that looks like fun.
- Fun? I suppose it is.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.100
I never really thought about it.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
You see, the Segway
is more of a productivity tool.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.000
- Yeah, do you think I could...?
- No, go away.

If I'm grumpy,
it's because of Cam Winston.

Yes, I do, and I think it's great.

Okay, fine. Whatever.

As am I. That's why I called you.

Just for the record,

15:34.500 --> 15:35.700
Well, that seems appropriate,
