WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:05.080
WOMAN: Certainly, sir.
Which event?

00:05.120 --> 00:07.400
The one were the prisoners take on
the wild beasts.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.440
The prisoner executions, sure.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.600
Hm. They're all sold out,
I'm afraid.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.200
More shows will be added
if there's enough appetite.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.520
From the punters or the beasts?
Both.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.200
You're welcome to add your names
to the waiting list.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.480
How about them massive
chubby chickens?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.560
The ostrich show's sold out too.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.760
Oh, the Mr Fatty Long-Nose.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.840
As is the elephant parade.
What do you have tickets for?

00:28.880 --> 00:32.360
The only animal show not sold out
is the pig chase.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.400
Right. What does that involve?

00:34.440 --> 00:36.480
Guys trying to catch
some greased up pigs.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.800
That sounds absolutely mind blowing.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.600
We're not paying to watch pigs.
You can get that on a farm.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.720
We have to see something.
Three tickets for the pig chase.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.400
That's just sold out.
Oh, for fu...

00:50.600 --> 00:54.640
# OLI JULIAN FEAT. MICHAEL PROPHET:

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.060 --> 01:07.060
I really wouldn't bother.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.100
Nothing good happens to us.
Accept it.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.540
I will not accept it. No, sir.
We've got no money.

01:11.580 --> 01:14.020
The one with the best job is a slave.
Ah, thank you.

01:14.060 --> 01:16.140
And in the biggest city in the world,

01:16.180 --> 01:18.500
I still can't find anyone
who'll go out with me.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.700
It's a dry patchizzle. You'll put
that thing to use sooner or later.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.620
(SCOFFS) I may as well cut it off
and use it as a spare thumb.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.820
Hey, will you be my boyfriend?

01:26.860 --> 01:28.940
Er... (CHUCKLES) Sorry.
Will I...?

01:28.980 --> 01:32.020
I need you to be my boyfriend now.
Oi, you there.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.660
Please?
Ah, yes. Yes. Sure.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.460
Are you an animal rights dickhead
who's lobbing tomatoes at the area?

01:39.500 --> 01:42.180
Excuse me, Officer. Tomatoes?
Yeah.

01:42.220 --> 01:45.620
The splatty red things?
That is a criminal offence.

01:45.660 --> 01:47.740
Even in Gaul, I imagine.
But, Officer,

01:47.780 --> 01:49.940
I've been with my boyfriend
all afternoon.

01:49.980 --> 01:52.380
Ah, yes. I'm her boyfriend.
Hello.

01:52.420 --> 01:54.420
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

01:54.460 --> 01:58.060
We've been buying things for dinner.
Haven't we, darling?

01:58.100 --> 02:01.980
Oh... Yes! I'm cooking
a romantic dinner of grapes...

02:02.580 --> 02:05.220
..and an egg.
Mm. My favourite.

02:07.660 --> 02:11.100
If you don't mind, we really must
go home and make love now.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.620
Ooh. Er, OK.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.540
Yeah. On you go. As you were.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.660
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.700
I am sorry for kissing you.

02:21.740 --> 02:24.140
It's fine. You can keep the tomato.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.980
Is that it then?
Have we broken up already?

02:27.020 --> 02:29.260
I should find my other dickhead.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.460
We are doing another protest tonight
if you want to join us.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.740
We'd love to.
Meet us by the area at sunset.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.660
I'm Marcus, by the way.
Delphine.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.420
You gonna eat that?

02:45.180 --> 02:47.180
That was incredible.

02:47.220 --> 02:49.860
You could see the sparks fly,
right, G Man?

02:49.900 --> 02:52.220
I was more focussing on the tomato,
to be fair.

02:52.260 --> 02:55.420
She was just using me as an alibi.
She could have grabbed anyone.

02:55.460 --> 02:58.020
But she grabbed you.
It's definitely destiny, man.

02:58.060 --> 03:01.180
I'm not sure destiny's thought
this through. She's from Gaul.

03:01.220 --> 03:03.700
She chucks tomatoes at stuff.
She's a bit real.

03:03.740 --> 03:06.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're real.
You're really real.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.020
I think she's the Gaul for you.

03:09.060 --> 03:11.260
(CHUCKLES)
No, she's not my kind of Gaul.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.740
She's gonna be your Gaulfriend.
I can feel it.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.060
It's meant to go pink, blue,
pink, blue, you fat shit.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.820
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlady.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.780
What's with all the flowers?
I'm gentrifying, aren't I?

03:24.820 --> 03:27.660
The Games are in town.
I'm turning this rats nest

03:27.700 --> 03:30.940
into an exclusive urban
apartment complex.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.900
Sweet. How are you going to do that?
Raise the rent, mainly.

03:33.940 --> 03:37.180
That's another 30 a week.
Cough up, beaky.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.380
(SCOFFS)
Any word from Landlord, by the way?

03:39.420 --> 03:42.340
No, he was always crap
at keeping in touch.

03:42.380 --> 03:46.180
He's a lot worse now he's dead.
We don't know that, do we?

03:46.220 --> 03:48.940
Oh, give it a rest, gormless.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.380
He's been on the run almost a year.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.540
My boy's dead in a ditch by now.

03:53.580 --> 03:56.420
Another 30 is pretty steep.
Yeah.

03:56.460 --> 03:58.460
It's what he would have wanted.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.300
(SCOFFS)
Of course I don't have tickets.

04:03.340 --> 04:06.820
Animals are idiots. Why would anyone
want to watch those divs?

04:06.860 --> 04:09.500
The one's in the arena have got some
serious talent.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.540
Talent?  Yes.
For what?

04:11.580 --> 04:14.340
Pooing where they want
and licking their own privates?

04:14.380 --> 04:16.820
No. For being cute and scary
at the same time.

04:16.860 --> 04:19.540
We knew a guy at school who
could lick his own privates,

04:19.579 --> 04:23.020
so that's not animal specific.
What? No. Surely not.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.300
Apparently,
one in 20 guys can reach.

04:25.340 --> 04:28.500
Oh, as if it's possible to reach.
It is if you try hard enough.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.700
But...
I mean, that's...

04:30.740 --> 04:33.500
(STRAINS)

04:35.940 --> 04:37.940
You can't get anywhere near it.
Look.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.980
Stop that.
Yes. Sorry. Was just making a point.

04:41.020 --> 04:44.500
Kindly make your point at home,
water boy. You dirty devil.

04:44.540 --> 04:46.660
Yes, will do, water man.
Oh, Flavia.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.100
You haven't got any tickets for
the beasts have you?

04:49.140 --> 04:51.980
I don't need tickets.
I've got a luxury box in the arena.

04:52.020 --> 04:54.020
Whoa. How?
My husband got it.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.100
Then he got a bouncy bimbo
to run off to Greece with.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.780
Leaving both me and the box behind.

04:59.820 --> 05:02.220
Oh, no. How big is your box,
out of interest?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.300
Any chance I could squeeze in there?

05:04.340 --> 05:08.460
My box is narrow and snug, shredder,
and I'd rather hoped to fill it

05:08.500 --> 05:12.340
with an eligible suitor rather than
some grubby goon from work.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.340
I'm just desperate to see
the beasts. I'd do anything.

05:15.380 --> 05:18.500
Very well. Go get some sacks
and ropes from the store room.

05:18.540 --> 05:20.540
Oh, yes! Hang on.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.580
Is this a sex thing?
Quickly.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.100
You will do yourself a mischief.

05:29.020 --> 05:31.100
In his hasty escape,

05:31.140 --> 05:34.540
that randy little rat left
all of his crap behind, see?

05:34.580 --> 05:36.580
Whoa! This is a lot of stuff.
Indeed!

05:36.620 --> 05:41.140
He was an avid collector of art,
wine and women, as it turned out.

05:41.180 --> 05:44.940
Take it all to the dump for me,
and you can come in my box.

05:44.980 --> 05:47.660
Can I keep any of it?
There's no point. It's all broken.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.620
This stuff here isn't.
Oh, is it not?  No.

05:50.660 --> 05:56.380
You little shit!
You dirty, dirty, cheating shit!

05:58.340 --> 06:00.580
OK. I'll dump it.
If you would.

06:32.980 --> 06:36.140
I say.
What do you think you're doing?

06:36.180 --> 06:39.140
I will not tolerate fly tipping!

06:40.460 --> 06:44.980
You can shift all that filthy
clutter n'all. That includes Grumio.

06:45.020 --> 06:47.100
What? I'm not going anywhere.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.140
I can't have you lowering the tone.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.220
You're worse than mould.
(SHEEP BLEATING)

06:51.260 --> 06:54.740
And you can shut your noise, girl,
and all.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.180
Thank the gods I won't have to
put up with that din much longer.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.220
You're not selling Juno?
No.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.300
Actually, I'm eating her.
Right.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.420
But she's Landlords'.

07:05.460 --> 07:08.780
And he's dead.
They'll be reunited, won't they?

07:08.820 --> 07:10.820
Soon as I've boiled her up.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.020
Oi! Let go!
(BLEATING)

07:13.060 --> 07:15.860
Let go!
Let go you bitey little bitch.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.900
(BLEATING)
Right!

07:18.420 --> 07:21.780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bloody hell. That's a bit full on.

07:21.820 --> 07:25.780
Finger up the bum. The only language
your dumb animal speaks.

07:28.340 --> 07:30.340
I'm getting my stew pot.

07:32.180 --> 07:34.180
(SNIFFS)

07:35.660 --> 07:37.660
Hold up. What are you doing?

07:42.820 --> 07:45.500
You idiot.
Landlady's a total hard arse

07:45.540 --> 07:48.140
and now you've got her goat.
Literally got her goat.

07:48.180 --> 07:51.180
She were gonna eat her, tough.
Who brings a goat on a protest?

07:51.220 --> 07:53.980
It'll be fine, man.
She can bleat along with the chants.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.060
If there are chants.
We don't know, do we?

07:56.100 --> 07:59.540
We've never protested about anything.
Or ever cared about anything.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.700
Uh-uh. Not true.
We care about hot girls.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.740
If they're protesting, so are we.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.780
I just wanted to blend in.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.700
Not expose ourselves as
the dopey twats we obviously are.

08:08.740 --> 08:11.220
Please calm down.
We'll absolutely nail this.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.500
You rescued a goat? That's amazing.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.780
Oh. Yeah. Exactly.

08:20.820 --> 08:23.100
We knew we had to intervene,
didn't we, Grumio?

08:23.140 --> 08:26.020
Our landlady was going to eat it.
She fingered it up the bum.

08:26.060 --> 08:28.780
Yeah. What? Did she?
She sounds horrible.

08:28.820 --> 08:30.820
And unhygienic.
Yeah, well.

08:30.860 --> 08:32.860
People do sick things
to animals here.

08:32.900 --> 08:36.260
Look at The Games. They're stacking
elephants on top of each other.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.900
For entertainment.
No way! How many can they do?

08:38.940 --> 08:42.100
Does it matter? They're making
monkeys wear little hats.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.140
(CHUCKLES FONDLY)

08:44.940 --> 08:47.580
Oh, dear me, that's...
We hate that kind of thing.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.660
Please may I have another tomato?

08:49.700 --> 08:52.100
Sorry, cherie.
We need them for the protest.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.420
Great.
Where we splatting these guys then?

08:54.460 --> 08:58.140
We're not. We're pulping them.
Ah, right. So how's that work?

08:58.180 --> 09:00.380
Tonight's protest
is more of a tableau.

09:00.420 --> 09:03.020
So we pulp the tomatoes
to look like blood

09:03.060 --> 09:05.180
and then we smear it on our naked
bodies.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.220
Yeah, great. Sorry, what?

09:07.260 --> 09:10.900
It's a naked protest. We're gonna
lay down like slaughtered animals.

09:10.940 --> 09:13.140
And the animals have to be naked,
do they?

09:13.180 --> 09:15.180
Animals usually are.
Fair point.

09:15.220 --> 09:18.300
Please, guys? We need more males
to balance out the herd.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.340
You'll do it, right?
Big time.

09:20.380 --> 09:22.660
Yeah, whatever.
Sorry, can you give us a sec?

09:25.060 --> 09:28.220
This is not how I want Delphine
to see me naked for the first time.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.900
You'll see her naked too.
I'm sure she'll look great.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.980
It's chilly, and broad daylight.

09:33.020 --> 09:35.100
My penis does not fly
in these conditions.

09:35.140 --> 09:38.380
Hurry up, Marcus. I'm saving a place
for you next to me.

09:38.420 --> 09:42.740
Yeah! Sorry. Just having some trouble
with my belt knot.

09:43.260 --> 09:46.420
She'll be protesting, not checking
out the size of you penoose.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.100
She'll be protesting against the size
of my penoose.

09:49.140 --> 09:52.340
Grumio's ready, look.
Yeah, I know. I'm trying not to look.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.380
Do you need me to help you?

09:54.420 --> 09:58.020
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
No thanks! It's just a granny knot.

09:58.060 --> 10:00.060
Ooh, ey up. Centurions.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.740
Oh, thank Jove for that.
Hello, Officer.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.380
Hi. There's a bit of a protest here.
You might wanna shut it down.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.660
Oh, not another one. What are these
clowns doing this time?

10:10.700 --> 10:13.940
Yeah, they're stripping off
and covering themselves in tomato.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.980
Oh, OK. Well that's fine then.

10:16.020 --> 10:18.020
Wow. Is it?

10:18.060 --> 10:20.980
They're not damaging anything,
they can do what they want.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.500
Surely they're disturbing the peace.
It's pretty disturbing stuff.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.180
Just looks like some girls taking
their clothes off.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.300
Which is absolutely fine by me.
(CHUCKLES)

10:29.340 --> 10:31.460
DELPHINE:
Marcus, what's the problem?

10:33.300 --> 10:37.220
Don't you try and stop me,
you bully boy bastard.

10:37.260 --> 10:40.220
What? I'm not.
This is a peaceful protest

10:40.260 --> 10:43.780
against the sick cruelty to beasts.
You've no right to stop me.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.820
I know. That's what I've just said.

10:45.860 --> 10:48.620
He said if I take my clothes off,
he's going to arrest me.

10:48.660 --> 10:51.180
What the fuck?
No, I never said...

10:51.220 --> 10:53.220
No!

10:53.260 --> 10:55.260
You oppressive shit!

10:55.300 --> 10:57.300
(GROANS)

10:57.340 --> 10:59.340
No, no, no!

10:59.380 --> 11:01.380
(OVERLAPPING SPEECH)

11:03.420 --> 11:06.820
(SCREAMING)
Centurion brutality!

11:08.020 --> 11:10.020
Keep walking.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.420
Morning, wankers.
You got bail.

11:14.460 --> 11:17.900
You're free to go. Sentencing's
this afternoon in the Forum.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.940
Stay out of trouble. OK, lads?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.980
Thank you. Yes, will do.
(GRUMIO SNORES)

11:22.060 --> 11:24.060
And put your bloody tunic back on.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.540
(GROANS SLEEPILY)

11:26.580 --> 11:28.860

11:30.580 --> 11:32.580
Fuck the police!

11:32.620 --> 11:35.500
(CHEERING)

11:45.300 --> 11:47.940
Oh, hi. Thanks.
Thanks?

11:47.980 --> 11:51.180
I mean, sorry. That's what you say
when people kiss you?

11:51.220 --> 11:53.220
Thanks or sorry?

11:53.260 --> 11:55.340
Historically, yes.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

11:55.380 --> 11:58.660
You guys bailed us out?  Of course.
You took a beating for us.

11:58.700 --> 12:01.580
Yeah, I mean, we managed to get in
a couple of good punches,

12:01.620 --> 12:04.660
I'm just gutted I couldn't do
the whole naked protest thing.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.700
Another time, maybe?
Yeah.

12:06.740 --> 12:10.820
Or instead, how about dinner tonight
at my place?

12:10.860 --> 12:12.860
Sounds good.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.300
Where's you anally abused goat,
by the way?

12:16.260 --> 12:18.940
Juno! Juno!

12:26.020 --> 12:28.460
It's still warm. She must be close.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.860
Yeah, that's not telling me much.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.220
Juno?

12:36.740 --> 12:39.060
No, it wasn't that.
How did you hurt your neck?

12:39.100 --> 12:41.380
I just slept funny.
How funny?

12:41.420 --> 12:43.420
End up trying to suck you're on nob?
No.

12:43.460 --> 12:46.220
That would be funny.
Don't pretend you've never tried.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.420
He doesn't need to.
He's got a Gaulfriend.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.420
She gave him a Gaulic kiss.
What? You're kidding me.

12:51.460 --> 12:54.180
Tonight, she's bringing a baguette.
What does that mean?

12:54.220 --> 12:56.740
I think it's just long bread.
I can't handle this.

12:57.460 --> 13:00.820
Shredder, a quick word in my office.
Oh.  I did warn you.

13:08.340 --> 13:10.340
No. Juno!

13:11.580 --> 13:13.940
Juno! Move back.
(BLEATING)

13:13.980 --> 13:16.540
Let go, Juno!
Oi!

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
(SHUDDERS)
(BLEATING)

13:20.780 --> 13:24.060
You managed to get everything
to the dump, then, did you?

13:24.100 --> 13:26.100
Er, yes, thanks. All fine.

13:26.140 --> 13:29.820
Curious.
I wonder, then, how Simeon here,

13:29.860 --> 13:33.660
found a bag full of my husband's
adult toys in his front garden.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.020
Hello again.
How did you...

13:36.060 --> 13:38.460
Company address was printed
on the sack

13:38.500 --> 13:41.940
that you so carelessly tossed into
my privet.

13:41.980 --> 13:45.620
It's an absolute disgrace, frankly.
OK. You're right. I'm really sorry.

13:45.660 --> 13:49.380
To throw out such high quality
leatherwear like that...

13:49.420 --> 13:51.540
Simeon is quite the aficionado.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.580
Well, I dabble.

13:53.620 --> 13:57.980
I must say, this is the finest
lambskin gimp mask I've ever handled.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.740
He's persuaded me to hang onto it
after all, shredder.

14:00.780 --> 14:03.740
Cool. Sorry, have I done bad
or good? I can't tell.

14:03.780 --> 14:06.300
Very good. You've excelled yourself.

14:06.340 --> 14:09.100
Thanks to your in-built idiocy,
I've met Simeon, here.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.540
Great! So I can still use your box
later on, then?

14:11.580 --> 14:14.780
As a result, I know have a much
better man to fill my box with.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.820
Sorry, old chum.
What?

14:16.860 --> 14:19.300
No, don't take this guy.
You barely know him.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.340
We've only met briefly,
but, in that time,

14:21.380 --> 14:23.700
we really have bonded, haven't we?

14:23.740 --> 14:25.740
I'll say.

14:25.780 --> 14:27.860
What about me?
How am I going to see the beasts?

14:27.900 --> 14:30.020
There's a waiting list.
Add you name to it.

14:30.060 --> 14:32.140
I already have.
Well, do it again.

14:48.380 --> 14:50.660
My azaleas bitten to buggery.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.940
Shit all over my courtyard.

14:52.980 --> 14:55.900
It's Landlord's courtyard.
Punch him in the head, Davus.

14:55.940 --> 14:59.180
I'd rather not. He's me mate.
Punch the goat in the head then.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.740
We're fairly tight as well.
Right!

15:01.780 --> 15:04.100
It's time for my dinner.

15:04.140 --> 15:06.140
Don't.
Give us it here.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.180
Stop it! No!
Stop it!

15:08.220 --> 15:10.220
(GROANS)

15:10.260 --> 15:13.300
Right! That is it!

15:16.980 --> 15:20.460
You got us evicted, for the sake of
our dead landlord's rancid goat?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
Yeah, it got a bit out of hand.

15:22.540 --> 15:25.100
What about my sexy dinner date
with Delphine?

15:25.140 --> 15:27.140
I'm back to getting naked
in the street.

15:27.180 --> 15:29.580
(FOOTSTEPS)
Good afternoon, citizens.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.860
Here are today's sentences.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.020
Julius Drusus, charged with
shoplifting, 25 denarii fine.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.140
(CROWD CHEERING)
Forza Alfidia,

15:38.180 --> 15:42.060
charged with soliciting
without a licence, 300 denarii fine.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.380
Bloody hell.
Ours had better not be that much.

15:44.420 --> 15:49.580
Marcus Gallow, Stylax Urastaques
and Grumio, no surname given,

15:49.620 --> 15:53.740
charged with assaulting a centurion,
50 denarii fine.

15:53.780 --> 15:56.300
(CROWD CHEERING)
That's fine. That's a fine fine.

15:57.740 --> 15:59.740
What's going on now?

15:59.780 --> 16:03.500
Ladies and gentlemen, I've just been
informed that due to popular demand,

16:03.540 --> 16:06.700
one more beast show has been added
for this afternoon.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.940
(CHEERING)
Oh, yes! That was me!

16:08.980 --> 16:11.140
I was the popular demand!
Boom.  Yeah!

16:11.180 --> 16:13.900
Let's get to the box office
and snaffle some good seats.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.820
As a result,
we'll be needing more prisoners

16:16.860 --> 16:20.020
so those people just mentioned
will no longer have to pay a fine...

16:20.060 --> 16:22.060
What?
This gets better and better.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.700
Shh. Hang on. ..as they will now be
sentenced to death

16:24.740 --> 16:27.020
by wild beasts in the arena.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.060
Have a great day.

16:46.660 --> 16:49.260
Now you will.
Right up close.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.540
Bit too close.
I didn't want to see inside them.

16:51.580 --> 16:54.940
Should have thought of that before
you filled in that waiting list.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.500
You punched centurion because you
didn't want to get your wang out.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.340
At least we won't have
to find somewhere to live any more.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.700
Because we won't live any more.
I know.

17:03.740 --> 17:07.420
I'm just saying. Every cloud.

Soz, mate.

17:12.819 --> 17:14.819
She keeps wandering off.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.500
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlord.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.540
Landlord?

17:21.500 --> 17:24.060
Where've you been?
Well, how long have you got?

17:24.099 --> 17:26.940
Not long. Probably just give us
the gist, if poss.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.140
OK. Ran away, hid in a cave, got
caught, brought here, met you lot.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.500
But you've got a way out of this,
right?

17:33.540 --> 17:35.700
You're dodgy as fuck.
Surely you got a plan?

17:35.740 --> 17:37.740
Yeah, I have, actually.

17:37.780 --> 17:40.900
Gonna knock myself out on the
arena wall before something eats me.

17:40.940 --> 17:44.300
Right. And how about if we want
to avoid getting eaten altogether?

17:44.340 --> 17:47.460
Oh, well. If you beat the beasts,
then you're laughing.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.380
Wicked. let's do that, then.
15 years ago I think someone did.

17:51.420 --> 17:54.220
OK, great.
Back when they used to use badgers.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.260
And squirrels.

Hey!

18:03.260 --> 18:05.500

18:05.540 --> 18:07.540
I heard. It's so shitty.

18:07.580 --> 18:10.140
Have you come to watch?
No, we're protesting outside.

18:10.180 --> 18:12.260
And they listening?
Will they let us go?

18:12.300 --> 18:15.540
No idea. We're protesting against
the animal cruelty.

18:15.580 --> 18:17.580
(SCOFFS)
What about the human cruelty?

18:17.620 --> 18:20.020
I'm gonna get eaten alive.
I'm trying to do both.

18:20.060 --> 18:22.580
It's amazing that you'd die
for the cause like this.

18:22.620 --> 18:25.380
What? I'm not dying
for the bloody cause.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.420
I don't give a shit about the cause.

18:27.460 --> 18:29.860
If I'm honest,
I don't even really like animals.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.900
I did this because I really fancy you

18:31.940 --> 18:35.060
and didn't want you seeing my scared
little willy in broad daylight.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.100
How's that for a cause?
Come on!

18:37.140 --> 18:39.140
(CHEERING)

18:44.700 --> 18:46.700
I don't want to die now.

18:46.740 --> 18:49.820
I mean, I'm not keen on it happening
at all, but not now.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.700
I've got no regrets.
Really? No regrets? None at all?

18:53.740 --> 18:55.780
I suppose I could have had
more sleep.

18:55.820 --> 18:58.500
I wish I'd had more sex.
(TUTS) Don't we all, mate.

18:58.540 --> 19:01.420
Or at least another go on myself.
I wonder if I can...

19:01.460 --> 19:04.300
No. The adrenaline should speed
things up.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.460
Isn't it humiliating enough
without throwing in a death wank?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
Fine, I won't.

I know the odds aren't...great,

19:42.940 --> 19:44.940

together and work as a team,

through that gate, we can take it.
