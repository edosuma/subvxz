WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.206
DOES THIS RELATIONSHIP
HAVE A FUTURE?
 CAN'T WE JUST KEEP

00:05.206 --> 00:07.778
GOING THE WAY WE ARE?
 JACKSON LEFT.

00:07.778 --> 00:11.082
ORSON'S LYING TO ME AGAIN.
 BREE MADE A DECISION.

00:11.082 --> 00:13.044
SO I THINK I HAVE
TO DIVORCE HIM.
 KARL SIGNED UP.

00:13.044 --> 00:15.516
KARL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.388
WELL, I JUST ENROLLED EVAN.

00:17.388 --> 00:19.190
WOW.

00:19.190 --> 00:22.093
AND SUSAN CONFESSED.
 MIKE AND I GOT
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

00:22.093 --> 00:24.325
MIKE WAS DRIVING, RIGHT?
 THAT'S WHAT WE SAID,

00:24.325 --> 00:27.298
BUT IT WASN'T TRUE.
HE TOOK THE BLAME FOR ME.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.805
(Mary Alice) ON THIS STREET,

00:34.805 --> 00:38.069
THE BARGAINING BEGINS
AT SUNRISE...

00:38.069 --> 00:42.273
AN OLD WOMAN OFFERS A PAPERBOY
A GENEROUS TIP

00:42.273 --> 00:45.546
IF HE'LL THROW THE PAPER
ONTO HER PORCH...

00:45.546 --> 00:50.281
A WIFE TELLS HER HUSBAND
SHE'LL MAKE HIS FAVORITE DINNER

00:50.281 --> 00:53.584
IF HE'LL BRING HOME ROSES...

00:53.584 --> 00:57.428
A MAN TELLS HIS NEIGHBOR
HE'LL TAKE IN HIS GARBAGE CANS

00:57.428 --> 01:00.661
THE DAY
SHE FINALLY MOWS HER LAWN.

01:00.661 --> 01:04.135
YES, ON WISTERIA LANE,

01:04.135 --> 01:06.767
EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO BARGAIN--

01:06.767 --> 01:09.200
ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.443
I DON'T WANT OATMEAL.
CAN I HAVE PANCAKES?

01:12.443 --> 01:15.206
KATHERINE'S NOT
A SHORT ORDER COOK, BUDDY.

01:15.206 --> 01:18.149
IF SHE MADE OATMEAL FOR
BREAKFAST, WE'RE HAVING OATMEAL.

01:18.149 --> 01:21.312
I TELL YOU WHAT, M.J.
IF YOU FINISH JUST HALF OF IT,

01:21.312 --> 01:23.854
I WILL MAKE CANDIED APPLES
FOR YOUR SLEEPOVER.

01:23.854 --> 01:28.189
I LOVE CANDY APPLES.
 SHE'S LETTING YOU OFF EASY.
YOU SHOULD THANK HER.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.860
THANK YOU, KATHERINE.

01:29.860 --> 01:33.124
YOU ARE SO WELCOME,
YOU SWEET THING.

01:33.124 --> 01:36.297
DAD, ARE YOU GONNA MARRY
KATHERINE?

01:39.230 --> 01:41.672
(mouth full) UM...
(chuckles)

01:41.672 --> 01:44.235
THAT'S, UM...

01:44.235 --> 01:45.636
I DON'T KNOW.

01:45.636 --> 01:47.308
WHY NOT?

01:47.308 --> 01:52.112
OH, WELL, OH, BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T
TALKED ABOUT MARRIAGE.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.814
WHY NOT?

01:53.814 --> 01:56.647
M.J., YOU'RE BEING RUDE.

01:56.647 --> 01:59.650
OH, I'M NOT OFFENDED.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.454
DON'T YOU WANNA MARRY
KATHERINE?

02:03.454 --> 02:05.326
(laughs) WELL...

02:05.326 --> 02:06.627
I LOVE HER.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.330
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.862
SO WHY DON'T YOU MARRY HER?

02:11.862 --> 02:14.205
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

02:14.205 --> 02:16.307
ARE YOU KIDDING?

02:17.568 --> 02:20.471
BUDDY, UM,
WHEN IT COMES TO MARRIAGE,

02:20.471 --> 02:22.343
THE TRUTH IS...

02:22.343 --> 02:25.346
WOW. WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THE TIME? I'M LATE FOR WORK.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.449
(keys jangle)
 WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.580
COWARD.

02:29.580 --> 02:32.823
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

02:32.823 --> 02:35.586
HOW'D I DO?

02:35.586 --> 02:37.358
YOU WERE GREAT.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.290
BUT HE DIDN'T ANSWER ME.

02:39.290 --> 02:42.333
DOESN'T MATTER.
ISSUE'S ON THE TABLE.

02:42.333 --> 02:44.365
YES, ON THIS STREET,

02:44.365 --> 02:47.468
THE NEGOTIATING BEGINS
AT SUNRISE,

02:47.468 --> 02:49.470
AND IT DOESN'T END...

02:49.470 --> 02:51.472
HERE'S THE ICE CREAM
I PROMISED YOU.

02:51.472 --> 03:06.457
UNTIL SOMEONE GETS
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT.

03:06.457 --> 03:09.320
WALTER BERGEN WAS
A DIVORCE LAWYER,

03:09.320 --> 03:12.493
AND THE WOMEN WHO HIRED HIM
ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING TO SAY

03:12.493 --> 03:15.696
ABOUT THE MEN
THEY WERE DIVORCING.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.728
HE'S ALWAYS TALKING
TO HIS GRANDMOTHER,

03:17.728 --> 03:20.731
WHO DIED SIX YEARS AGO.

03:20.731 --> 03:22.733
HE SPENDS ALL HIS MONEY
ON HOOKERS,

03:22.733 --> 03:25.506
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE WOMEN.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.938
HE SAYS HE NEEDS MORE MONEY
FOR THE CHILDREN,

03:27.938 --> 03:29.440
AND BY "CHILDREN,"

03:29.440 --> 03:32.483
I MEAN RACEHORSES.

03:32.483 --> 03:35.946
YES, WALTER BERGEN THOUGHT
HE HAD HEARD IT ALL

03:35.946 --> 03:40.751
UNTIL THE DAY WHEN ONE
OF HIS CLIENTS ACTUALLY SAID...

03:40.751 --> 03:44.325
MY HUSBAND IS A DECENT MAN,
AND I WANT TO DO RIGHT BY HIM.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.456
HMM.

03:45.456 --> 03:48.859
WOMEN WHO SEEK MY SERVICES
RARELY TAKE THAT ATTITUDE.

03:48.859 --> 03:51.662
WELL, I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF
AS A GOOD PERSON.

03:51.662 --> 03:53.464
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

03:53.464 --> 03:55.506
AND I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

03:55.506 --> 03:56.807
THE INCOME HE'LL DERIVE

03:56.807 --> 03:59.510
FROM HIS HALF OF THE CATERING
BUSINESS ALONE SHOULD--

03:59.510 --> 04:01.572
WAIT. I'M NOT PLANNING
ON GIVING HIM HALF.

04:01.572 --> 04:03.474
IT'S MY BUSINESS.

04:03.474 --> 04:06.577
WHICH YOU STARTED
AFTER YOU WERE MARRIED.

04:06.577 --> 04:09.249
THAT ENTITLES HIM TO HALF.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.482
I-I MAY HAVE
OVERSTATED THINGS

04:11.482 --> 04:13.684
WHEN I DESCRIBED MY HUSBAND
AS A DECENT MAN.

04:13.684 --> 04:17.257
HE ACTUALLY HAS A WIDE VARIETY
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.361
MRS. HODGE, IT'S STATE LAW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.363
I WANT YOU TO SAY
THAT FOR $300 AN HOUR,

04:22.363 --> 04:24.495
YOU HAVE SOME LAWYER TRICKS
UP YOUR SLEEVE

04:24.495 --> 04:26.497
TO HELP ME
PROTECT MY BUSINESS.

04:26.497 --> 04:29.770
SURELY YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME
TO DO SOMETHING CRIMINAL?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.805
MRS. HODGE, DIDN'T YOU SAY

04:34.805 --> 04:38.809
YOU LIKE TO THINK OF YOURSELF
AS A GOOD PERSON?

04:38.809 --> 04:41.352
WELL, CLEARLY, I LIKE
TO THINK OF MYSELF

04:41.352 --> 04:44.585
AS A RICH PERSON EVEN MORE.

04:46.957 --> 04:49.990
OH! FULL HOUSE.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.693
BREE TAKES THE HIGH. GABY GETS
THE LOW. SPLIT THE POT.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.595
OH, I HATE SPLITTING THE POT.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.698
WELL, THAT'S THE RULE. THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.930
SO STOP BITCHING.
 WELL, YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT.

04:59.930 --> 05:03.404
I AM THE WIFE OF FAIRVIEW'S
LATINO BUSINESSMAN OF THE YEAR.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.706
HEY!
 SO HE FINALLY WON?

05:05.706 --> 05:08.409
(laughs) YEAH.
THERE'S GONNA BE A HUGE DINNER,

05:08.409 --> 05:11.482
AND WE'RE TAKING A PICTURE
WITH THE MAYOR AND HIS WIFE.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.914
OH, NOT NECESSARILY. I HEAR
THEY'RE GETTING DIVORCED,

05:13.914 --> 05:16.787
AND IT'S GONNA GET UGLY.
 (Katherine)
REALLY? HOW DO YOU KNOW?

05:16.787 --> 05:18.789
THE WIFE HIRED

05:18.789 --> 05:21.922
THE SLEAZIEST, MOST UNETHICAL
DIVORCE LAWYER IN TOWN.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.625
OH. WHO--WHO'S THAT?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.597
MY EX-HUSBAND.

05:26.597 --> 05:28.599
OH, RIGHT.
KARL'S A DIVORCE LAWYER.

05:28.599 --> 05:30.461
YEAH, AND A TOTAL SHARK.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.463
THE WORST THING ABOUT
OUR DIVORCE

05:32.463 --> 05:34.605
WAS THAT I COULDN'T HIRE HIM
TO REPRESENT ME.

05:34.605 --> 05:37.668
BUT I THOUGHT YOU JUST SPLIT
EVERYTHING DONE THE MIDDLE.
 OH, NOT WITH KARL.

05:37.668 --> 05:40.641
BY THE TIME HE'S DONE FINDING
LOOPHOLES AND HIDING ASSETS,

05:40.641 --> 05:43.374
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SPLIT.

05:43.374 --> 05:44.675
YOU DON'T SAY.

05:44.675 --> 05:46.377
HEY, LADIES.

05:46.377 --> 05:47.778
UH, LYNETTE, AHEM.

05:47.778 --> 05:51.021
IT'S GETTING KINDA LATE.

05:51.021 --> 05:54.024
ARE YOU KICKING US OUT, TOM?
 UH, NO.
NO, JUST REMINDING LYNETTE

05:54.024 --> 05:56.787
THAT IT'S, UH,
TEN MINUTES TILL MIDNIGHT,

05:56.787 --> 05:59.490
WHICH MEANS TEN MINUTES
TILL TOMORROW.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.892
I GOT IT. I'LL BE RIGHT UP.

06:04.935 --> 06:06.767
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.769
TOM AND I ARE READING
THIS BOOK THAT SUGGESTS

06:08.769 --> 06:12.643
COUPLES MAKE A PACT TO HAVE SEX
EVERY NIGHT FOR A MONTH.

06:12.643 --> 06:16.106
LET ME GUESS.
WRITTEN BY A GUY?
 WAS HIS NAME CARLOS SOLIS?

06:16.106 --> 06:19.450
(chuckles) WE'VE BEEN
HAVING SOME PROBLEMS,

06:19.450 --> 06:22.813
SO THE THEORY IS IT CREATES
INTIMACY AND BRINGS YOU CLOSER.

06:22.813 --> 06:24.815
IS IT WORKING?

06:24.815 --> 06:26.757
I'VE GOTTA SAY IT IS.

06:26.757 --> 06:28.759
YOU BECOME MORE ATTUNED
TO EACH OTHER'S NEEDS

06:28.759 --> 06:30.821
AND MORE SENSITIVE TO--
 (Tom) LYNETTE!

06:30.821 --> 06:33.494
JEEZ! TWO SECONDS!

06:33.494 --> 06:36.867
WE--WE SHOULD GO.
 NO, WE'RE IN OUR THIRD WEEK.
WE GOT THIS DOWN TO A SCIENCE.

06:36.867 --> 06:40.170
JUST DEAL ME OUT A FEW HANDS.

06:58.589 --> 07:01.652
(Gabrielle) JUANITA, HURRY UP.
THE BUS WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.794
BE RIGHT DOWN!

07:06.997 --> 07:10.000
THERE'S AN EXTRA PIECE
OF CINNAMON TOAST ON THE TABLE.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.502
NOT HUNGRY. BYE!

07:11.502 --> 07:12.833
(door opens)

07:12.833 --> 07:15.135
(door closes)

07:15.135 --> 07:17.538
(engine idling)

07:17.538 --> 07:18.969
(air hisses)

07:18.969 --> 07:22.042
(door creaks)

07:25.215 --> 07:28.979
SUSAN? IT'S DAVE.

07:28.979 --> 07:31.482
HEY, REMEMBER I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT MY BUDDY

07:31.482 --> 07:34.485
THAT OWNS THAT BOAT
ON BASS LAKE?

07:34.485 --> 07:36.787
YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT USING IT
THIS WEEKEND,

07:36.787 --> 07:39.790
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D TAKE
YOU AND M.J. FISHING.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.792
YEAH,
I KNOW IT'S SHORT NOTICE,

07:41.792 --> 07:44.094
BUT I REALLY WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING TO THANK YOU.

07:44.094 --> 07:46.096
YOU'VE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME
SINCE EDIE DIED.

07:46.096 --> 07:50.601
PLUS I KNOW
M.J. WOULD LOVE IT.

07:50.601 --> 07:53.644
GREAT. I'M REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

07:53.644 --> 07:54.975
BYE.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.547
(beep)

08:05.215 --> 08:06.486
(vacuum whirring,
telephone rings)

08:08.218 --> 08:09.920
(turns vacuum off)

08:09.920 --> 08:11.962
(beep)
 HELLO?

08:11.962 --> 08:14.595
OH, HI, PRINCIPAL HARDY.
WHAT'S UP?

08:15.926 --> 08:18.599
SHE'S WEARING WHAT?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.931
NOW MARCH IN THERE
AND WIPE THAT STUFF OFF!

08:20.931 --> 08:23.934
YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL.
 YES, I DO.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

08:23.934 --> 08:26.937
HOW HUMILIATING IT WAS
FOR ME TO GET THAT CALL TODAY?

08:26.937 --> 08:28.939
NOW EVERY PARENT IN TOWN
IS GONNA THINK

08:28.939 --> 08:32.883
THAT I LET MY 6-YEAR-OLD
WEAR MAKEUP TO SCHOOL!

08:32.883 --> 08:34.885
AND I WANT MY MAKEUP BACK.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.986
IS IT IN HERE? (sighs)

08:39.019 --> 08:42.292
WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS?

08:42.292 --> 08:43.924
JUANITA.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.526
I WAS TRYING TO LOOK
LIKE YOU.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.258
WHY?

08:48.258 --> 08:51.862
SOME GIRLS AT SCHOOL
SAW YOU PICK ME UP YESTERDAY

08:51.862 --> 08:54.635
AND TOLD ME
I MUST BE ADOPTED.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.868
THEY SAID I WASN'T PRETTY ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR DAUGHTER.

08:59.209 --> 09:01.241
(sighs)

09:08.849 --> 09:11.321
(groans)
 HOW'S IT FEELING,
MRS. McCLUSKEY?

09:11.321 --> 09:14.224
I-IT'S REALLY THROBBING.
OH, PLEASE HURRY.

09:14.224 --> 09:16.056
OKAY.

09:22.192 --> 09:24.234
(brakes squeal)

09:24.234 --> 09:25.736
HI THERE.

09:25.736 --> 09:29.239
JACKSON, HEY. YOU'RE BACK.

09:29.239 --> 09:32.172
I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.144
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?

09:34.144 --> 09:36.576
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.148
WELL, YOU DID.

09:38.148 --> 09:39.579
AHEM.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.181
OH, UH, RIGHT.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.213
JACKSON, YOU REMEMBER
MRS. McCLUSKEY, DON'T YOU?

09:43.213 --> 09:45.786
SURE. HOW ARE YOU,
MRS. McCLUSKEY?

09:45.786 --> 09:48.288
OH, I'M IN AGONIZING PAIN.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.290
I'M TAKING HER TO THE DOCTOR

09:50.290 --> 09:52.793
SO HE CAN PERFORM
A LITTLE PROCEDURE.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.995
HE'S GONNA LANCE A BOIL
ON MY BACKSIDE.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.227
IT MAY RUPTURE ANY SECOND.

09:57.227 --> 09:58.328
OKAY.

09:58.328 --> 10:02.633
I JUST HAD MY CAR DETAILED,
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.204
NO PROBLEM.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.306
UH, WHEN CAN I SEE YOU?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.809
UM...

10:08.809 --> 10:10.881
HOW ABOUT DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT?

10:10.881 --> 10:13.313
SOUNDS GREAT.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.787
IF YOU TWO WANT
TO KEEP STARING AT EACH OTHER,

10:16.787 --> 10:19.750
I CAN JUST GO LAY DOWN
ON THE LAWN AND DIE.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.321
I DON'T MIND.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.193
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.296
(grunts)

10:26.296 --> 10:27.828
(tires peal)

10:27.828 --> 10:30.801
(knock on door)

10:30.801 --> 10:32.132
KARL.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.404
HEY, MIKE. HEARD M.J.'s
HAVING A SLEEPOVER.

10:34.404 --> 10:36.807
I THOUGHT I'D HIT YOU UP
FOR AN INVITATION.

10:36.807 --> 10:40.010
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE OLD
FOR SLEEPOVERS?

10:40.010 --> 10:42.172
CARDS ON THE TABLE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

10:42.172 --> 10:45.175
EVAN'S ONE OF THE ONLY BOYS
IN CLASS WHO WASN'T INVITED,

10:45.175 --> 10:46.677
AND HE'S REALLY UPSET.

10:46.677 --> 10:50.120
OKAY, CARDS ON THE TABLE.
M.J. SAYS EVAN'S A BULLY,

10:50.120 --> 10:52.322
AND HE DOESN'T WANT HIM
AT HIS SLEEPOVER.

10:52.322 --> 10:55.726
WELL, WHAT IF I PROMISE EVAN
WILL BE ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR?

10:55.726 --> 10:58.889
I'M SORRY. IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.
M.J. FINALIZED HIS GUEST LIST.

10:58.889 --> 11:01.792
WELL, I THINK
IF YOU CHECK THAT LIST AGAIN,

11:01.792 --> 11:04.965
YOU'LL NOTICE EVAN'S NAME'S
ON THERE.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.798
I'M M.J.'s DAD,

11:07.798 --> 11:10.440
NOT HIS BOUNCER.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.842
BUT...

11:11.842 --> 11:13.173
THANKS.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.807
HEY, HONEY.
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING?

11:16.807 --> 11:19.309
VERY EXCITING. JUST GOT BACK
FROM THE GROCERY STORE.

11:19.309 --> 11:22.182
IT IS DOUBLE COUPON DAY,
SORTA LIKE THE OSCARS

11:22.182 --> 11:24.414
AND THE SUPER BOWL
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.

11:24.414 --> 11:26.817
(laughs) DID YOU REMEMBER
TO GET MY, UM...

11:26.817 --> 11:28.819
(lowered voice)
MY SPECIAL DEODORANT?

11:28.819 --> 11:30.320
I SURE DID. (chuckles)

11:30.320 --> 11:33.023
MILADY'S ARMPITS
WILL BE ALUMINUM-FREE.

11:33.023 --> 11:36.767
HOW IS YOUR DAY?
 I'm totally slammed,
which is why I'm calling.

11:36.767 --> 11:39.069
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA
BE HERE LATE TONIGHT,

11:39.069 --> 11:41.201
AND BY "LATE,"
I MEAN PAST MIDNIGHT.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.974
WAIT. W-WHAT ABOUT OUR PACT?

11:43.974 --> 11:47.908
WE'LL... DOUBLE UP TOMORROW.
 LYNETTE, I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS ALL DAY.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.240
I KNOW, AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.313
I WILL CALL YOU LATER.
I LOVE YOU. BYE. (kisses)
 (beep)

11:53.313 --> 11:55.786
(sighs)
 (beep)

12:00.390 --> 12:04.724
TOM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.156
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

12:06.156 --> 12:09.800
WELL,
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING...

12:09.800 --> 12:12.332
HERE?
 (locks door)

12:12.332 --> 12:15.065
OH, NO.

12:15.065 --> 12:17.267
ARE YOU CRAZY?

12:17.267 --> 12:19.369
CRAZY ABOUT YOU, BABY.

12:19.369 --> 12:21.912
BUT I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO,

12:21.912 --> 12:25.776
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE DONE
TILL 2:00 A.M.

12:25.776 --> 12:27.747
POSSIBLY 3:00.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.881
WHOO!
 COME ON. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
REMEMBER WHAT THE BOOK SAID?

12:30.881 --> 12:33.523
EVERY NIGHT, NO MATTER WHAT.

12:33.523 --> 12:37.487
(grunts)
 NO, THIS IS
A REALLY BAD TIME FOR ME.

12:37.487 --> 12:38.789
MM.

12:41.361 --> 12:46.096
WELL, YOU DID BUY ME
THAT DEODORANT. OOH!

12:46.096 --> 12:49.239
MMM.

12:49.239 --> 12:50.770
MMM.
 (beep)

12:50.770 --> 12:53.103
(woman) Lynette,
I have Carlos on line two.

12:53.103 --> 12:55.775
UH, TELL HIM
I'LL CALL RIGHT BACK.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.546
MM.

12:56.546 --> 12:59.850
He says it's really important.

12:59.850 --> 13:01.281
HELLO?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.084
Hey, Lynette. I'm over here
at Capital Consultants,

13:04.084 --> 13:06.086
AND THE GUYS HAVE A QUESTION.

13:06.086 --> 13:09.259
I NEED YOU TO PULL UP
THEIR ACCOUNT.
 Now? I'm kind of busy!

13:09.259 --> 13:12.022
WELL, THE AD HAS TO BE
AT THE PRINTER'S BY NOON,

13:12.022 --> 13:14.794
so yeah, now.
 MWAH. MMM.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.397
(moaning)

13:17.397 --> 13:20.430
(giggles)
 (Tom panting)

13:20.430 --> 13:24.204
LYNETTE?

13:24.204 --> 13:26.336
LYNETTE!

13:26.336 --> 13:28.178
Yes?

13:28.178 --> 13:29.910
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:29.910 --> 13:36.016
SORRY. JUST HAD THE HANDYMAN
IN HERE, BUT HE'S FINISHED.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.118
Thank you, handyman.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.921
(Tom) You're welcome, ma'am.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.894
So... Carlos...

13:43.894 --> 13:46.396
WHERE WERE WE?

13:47.998 --> 13:51.431
COULD I GET YOU SOMETHING?
 NO, THANKS, I DON'T DRINK.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.203
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:53.203 --> 13:55.906
GLUG GLUG. I REMEMBER NOW.

13:55.906 --> 13:58.909
I'M BRINGING YOU BUSINESS, KARL.
TRY NOT TO INSULT ME.

13:58.909 --> 14:00.410
SORRY.

14:00.410 --> 14:02.472
SO YOU WANT
TO DIVORCE ORSON.

14:02.472 --> 14:05.245
YES, I KNOW
THAT COMES AS A SURPRISE.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.547
NOT REALLY. I'VE MET HIM.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.049
THE GUY'S A STIFF.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.051
KARL, IF WE MOVE FORWARD,

14:11.051 --> 14:14.054
I WILL INSIST YOU HANDLE
OUR DIVORCE WITH DIGNITY.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.555
(sets pen down)

14:15.555 --> 14:17.057
ARE YOU SURE?

14:17.057 --> 14:20.230
I DON'T KNOW OF A DIGNIFIED WAY
TO SCREW A SPOUSE OUT OF MONEY

14:20.230 --> 14:22.963
THAT THEY, BY LAW,
ARE ENTITLED TO.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.195
THAT IS WHY YOU'RE HIRING ME,
RIGHT?

14:25.195 --> 14:28.198
I JUST WANT TO PROTECT
WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY MINE.

14:28.198 --> 14:30.040
CAN YOU HELP ME?

14:30.040 --> 14:31.942
(ice cubes rattling)
 SURE.

14:31.942 --> 14:33.103
LOVELY.

14:33.103 --> 14:36.006
I'LL MAKE OUT A CHECK.
 YEAH, NOT SO FAST.

14:36.006 --> 14:39.479
UH, I SAID I COULD DO IT,
NOT THAT I WOULD.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.111
I NEED A FAVOR.

14:41.111 --> 14:43.413
WELL, WHAT KIND OF A FAVOR?

14:45.115 --> 14:47.017
M.J. DELFINO IS HAVING

14:47.017 --> 14:49.219
A SLEEPOVER AT HIS HOUSE
IN TWO DAYS.

14:49.219 --> 14:52.422
MY SON WASN'T INVITED.
NOW HIS FEELINGS ARE HURT.

14:52.422 --> 14:54.394
SO?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.967
SO I WANT YOU TO GET MY SON
INTO THAT SLEEPOVER.

14:56.967 --> 15:00.130
HOW WOULD I GO ABOUT
DOING THAT?

15:00.130 --> 15:01.431
GOSH, I DON'T KNOW.

15:01.431 --> 15:05.035
HOW WOULD I GO ABOUT HIDING
YOUR ASSETS FROM ORSON?

15:05.035 --> 15:07.037
I NEED YOUR HELP, KARL.
I REALLY DO,

15:07.037 --> 15:11.281
BUT I AM NOT COMFORTABLE
MANIPULATING A 6-YEAR-OLD.

15:11.281 --> 15:15.085
MM-HMM. YOU KNOW,
I HAD THIS ONE CLIENT...

15:15.085 --> 15:17.387
HIS WIFE HAD BEEN WITH HIM
SINCE JUNIOR HIGH.

15:17.387 --> 15:19.389
SHE SUPPORTED HIM
THROUGH MED SCHOOL,

15:19.389 --> 15:22.222
GAVE HIM THREE KIDS
AND THE BEST YEARS OF HER LIFE.

15:22.222 --> 15:26.026
ONCE I HAD DONE MY PARTICULAR
BRAND OF LEGAL MAGIC,

15:26.026 --> 15:28.028
HE ENDED UP
WITH 90% OF THE MONEY,

15:28.028 --> 15:30.630
AND SHE ENDED UP
IN A STUDIO APARTMENT...

15:30.630 --> 15:32.432
WITH A ROOMMATE.

15:39.469 --> 15:41.141
THEN AGAIN...

15:41.141 --> 15:43.043
M.J. DOES...

15:43.043 --> 15:47.047
LOVE MY MACAROONS.

15:54.524 --> 15:57.027
SWEETIE, DON'T LISTEN
TO THOSE KIDS. THEY'RE IDIOTS.

15:57.027 --> 16:00.090
YOU ARE A GORGEOUS LITTLE GIRL.
 YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT.
YOU'RE MY DAD.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.332
NO, IT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU ARE NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL.

16:02.332 --> 16:06.266
MAKEUP JUST COVERS THAT UP.
 HE'S RIGHT, SWEETIE. YOU DON'T
NEED ALL THAT GUNK ON YOUR FACE.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.239
THEN WHY DO YOU WEAR IT?
 BECAUSE I'M AN ADULT.

16:09.239 --> 16:12.172
AND BESIDES,
I HARDLY WEAR ANY.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.175
COME ON, GABY.
LET'S TRY TO KEEP THIS REAL.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.348
ARE YOU GONNA WEAR MAKEUP
WHEN DADDY GETS HIS BIG AWARD?

16:18.348 --> 16:21.451
WELL, IT'S A BIG, FANCY DINNER.
OF COURSE.

16:21.451 --> 16:23.453
BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR.
 SWEETIE, YOU'RE 6.

16:23.453 --> 16:26.116
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
I CAN DO THAT YOU DON'T.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.118
SO YOU GET TO LOOK PRETTY
AT DADDY'S PARTY,

16:28.118 --> 16:31.261
AND I HAVE
TO LOOK LIKE THIS?

16:31.261 --> 16:34.724
HEY, I HAVE A GREAT IDEA.
 OKAY, SEE? YOUR DADDY'S
GOT A GREAT IDEA.

16:34.724 --> 16:38.428
HOW ABOUT IF NEITHER ONE OF YOU
WEARS MAKEUP TO THE DINNER?

16:38.428 --> 16:40.600
OKAY.
 (chuckles)

16:40.600 --> 16:45.205
NO, NO, NO.
YOUR DADDY'S JUST BEING SILLY.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.478
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND,
SILLY DADDY?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.782
(lowers voice) ARE YOU
A LUNATIC? I AM NOT WALKING

16:52.782 --> 16:56.386
INTO A BALLROOM FULL OF PEOPLE
WITHOUT MY FACE ON.
 COME ON. THIS IS
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

16:56.386 --> 16:58.448
TO TEACH HER
THAT BEAUTY'S ONLY SKIN DEEP.

16:58.448 --> 17:02.021
YEAH, WELL, ONCE YOU SEE
THIS SKIN WITHOUT FOUNDATION,

17:02.021 --> 17:05.355
YOU MAY WANT TO RETHINK THAT.
 GABY, YOUR DAUGHTER IS IN PAIN.
AND DON'T YOU LOVE HER ENOUGH

17:05.355 --> 17:07.527
TO PUT YOUR VANITY ASIDE
FOR ONE NIGHT?

17:07.527 --> 17:12.602
I WAS IN LABOR FOR 20 HOURS.
SHE STILL OWES ME FOR THAT!

17:12.602 --> 17:15.405
(scoffs) FINE.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.737
I WILL MAKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE,

17:17.737 --> 17:20.810
AND I WILL BE UGLY
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

17:20.810 --> 17:24.273
BUT IF SHE EVER NEEDS
A KIDNEY...

17:24.273 --> 17:26.415
(sighs)

17:29.179 --> 17:31.721
WOW. YOU'RE REALLY GOING ALL OUT
ON THIS SLEEPOVER.

17:31.721 --> 17:33.723
(chuckles)
 ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE

17:33.723 --> 17:36.686
THAT TONS OF SUGAR AND WHISTLES
ARE A GOOD COMBINATION.

17:36.686 --> 17:38.188
OH, GOOD POINT.

17:38.188 --> 17:41.491
I'LL MAKE US SOME GOODY BAGS
FILLED WITH EARPLUGS AND VODKA.

17:41.491 --> 17:44.234
IT'S GREAT. I'M SURE
M.J. WILL APPRECIATE IT.

17:44.234 --> 17:45.665
I'M SURE HE WILL.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.497
HE'S A GREAT KID...

17:47.497 --> 17:50.370
AND FUNNY.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.802
(laughs) THAT WAS HILARIOUS
THE OTHER DAY,

17:52.802 --> 17:56.376
WHEN HE ASKED US
WHEN WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
 I'M GLAD
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.478
I WAS TAP-DANCING
MY ASS OFF.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.181
NO, YOU WERE GREAT.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.452
ALTHOUGH...

18:02.452 --> 18:05.455
SOMEDAY YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.

18:05.455 --> 18:08.518
I'M SURE HE'S FORGOTTEN
BY NOW. YOU KNOW KIDS.

18:08.518 --> 18:10.260
KIDS ARE LIKE THAT.

18:10.260 --> 18:13.823
GROWN-UPS
ON THE OTHER HAND...

18:13.823 --> 18:15.595
NOT SO MUCH.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.098
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT M.J.
ANYMORE, ARE WE?

18:19.098 --> 18:23.133
OH, YOU WANT TO GO RUN
AND GET YOUR TAP SHOES?

18:23.133 --> 18:25.675
NO. NO.
I'LL BE COMPLETELY HONEST HERE.

18:25.675 --> 18:27.677
MOVING IN WITH YOU IS

18:27.677 --> 18:30.310
ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS
I EVER MADE.
 (chuckles)

18:30.310 --> 18:33.143
YOU MAKE ME
REALLY, REALLY HAPPY.

18:33.143 --> 18:35.385
BUT?

18:35.385 --> 18:37.517
I'VE BEEN MARRIED BEFORE,

18:37.517 --> 18:41.291
AND I JUST DON'T SEE MYSELF
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN.

18:44.394 --> 18:46.526
OKAY.

18:48.158 --> 18:50.460
PROBABLY NOT
WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.162
I WANTED THE TRUTH.

18:52.162 --> 18:54.364
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
THE TRUTH SUCKS.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.440
SO COULD YOU GET THE STREAMERS
OUT OF THE CAR?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.272
SURE.

19:03.613 --> 19:05.345
OH, BY THE WAY,

19:05.345 --> 19:07.517
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

19:07.517 --> 19:09.549
I DO LOVE YOU.

19:14.924 --> 19:16.886
(toots)

19:19.489 --> 19:23.563
I'VE ONLY BEEN WORKING THERE
TWO MONTHS, BUT I LOVE IT.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.535
AND THE KIDS ARE SO CUTE.

19:25.535 --> 19:30.370
AND I GET TO SEE M.J.
DURING THE DAY, WHICH IS NICE.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.543
UH, YOU KNOW, UH,

19:33.543 --> 19:36.706
FOR A GUY THAT JUST HAD
TO SEE ME SO BAD,

19:36.706 --> 19:40.550
YOU... YOU SEEM
AWFULLY FAR AWAY.

19:40.550 --> 19:43.613
I'M SORRY.

19:43.613 --> 19:45.585
I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.719
I HAVE SOMETHING...

19:49.719 --> 19:53.723
TO ASK YOU, AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GONNA REACT.

19:53.723 --> 19:56.596
WHAT IS IT?

19:57.967 --> 19:59.699
OH.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.503
THIS IS GONNA
COME OUT OF NOWHERE, BUT...

20:07.507 --> 20:09.509
I WANT YOU TO MARRY ME.

20:11.511 --> 20:16.446
A-AND HERE'S HOW I CAME TO THIS.
THE OTHER DAY...
 (gasps)

20:16.446 --> 20:18.348
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:18.348 --> 20:20.950
I HAVE TO GO UPSTAIRS.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.352
NOW?

20:22.352 --> 20:26.356
(crying)

20:29.299 --> 20:31.301
SUSAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

20:31.301 --> 20:34.664
I'M FINE. I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ME CRYING.

20:34.664 --> 20:37.337
HONEY,
YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.808
OH, I'M SORRY.

20:38.808 --> 20:40.640
JUST, UM,

20:40.640 --> 20:42.572
ALL THESE MONTHS,

20:42.572 --> 20:46.015
I'VE BEEN TELLING MYSELF THAT
I DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU,

20:46.015 --> 20:50.380
WHICH WAS EASY TO DO
BECAUSE YOU LEFT SO SUDDENLY.

20:50.380 --> 20:53.883
BUT I AM SO LONELY.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.885
AND AS MUCH AS I TELL MYSELF

20:55.885 --> 21:01.791
THAT I LIKE BEING THE STRONG,
SINGLE WOMAN ON HER OWN,

21:01.791 --> 21:03.993
THE TRUTH IS,

21:03.993 --> 21:07.367
I THINK ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.839
AND I WANTED TO CALL YOU,

21:09.839 --> 21:13.543
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU'D GOTTEN OVER ME.

21:13.543 --> 21:18.408
AND TO HEAR
THAT YOU STILL LOVE ME...

21:18.408 --> 21:20.410
THAT IS JUST SOMETHING

21:20.410 --> 21:23.713
THAT I REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR
RIGHT NOW.

21:23.713 --> 21:25.715
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW--

21:25.715 --> 21:28.718
OH, GOD. I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

21:28.718 --> 21:30.520
JACKSON...

21:30.520 --> 21:33.793
I LOVE YOU.

21:35.365 --> 21:36.666
(gasps)

21:36.666 --> 21:39.669
(panting)

21:44.534 --> 21:46.536
JACKSON?

21:46.536 --> 21:48.638
OH, GOD.

21:48.638 --> 21:52.782
I REALLY WISH
YOU'D LET ME FINISH.

21:52.782 --> 21:54.514
FINISH WHAT?

21:54.514 --> 21:56.886
SUSAN,
I NEED YOU TO MARRY ME

21:56.886 --> 22:00.720
SO THAT IMMIGRATION DOESN'T
DEPORT ME BACK TO CANADA.

22:03.653 --> 22:06.426
AND THE ONE THING
I DIDN'T TELL YOU IS THAT

22:06.426 --> 22:10.560
I'M HERE ON A STUDENT VISA
THAT EXPIRED SIX YEARS AGO,

22:10.560 --> 22:12.562
AND I GOT A CALL
FROM THE AUTHORITIES,

22:12.562 --> 22:15.565
SO UNLESS I CAN FIND SOMEBODY
THAT WILL MARRY ME,

22:15.565 --> 22:17.637
I'M GONNA BE
IN REALLY BIG TROUBLE.

22:20.069 --> 22:21.871
SUSAN?

22:21.871 --> 22:24.914
SUSAN, DID YOU HEAR ME?

22:26.746 --> 22:28.548
I HEARD.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.120
SO...

22:31.120 --> 22:33.022
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

22:35.755 --> 22:38.988
OKAY. OKAY,
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

22:38.988 --> 22:42.732
GET OUT OR I WILL KICK YOUR ASS
BACK TO THE CANADIAN BORDER!

22:42.732 --> 22:44.694
(thud)
 OW!

22:44.694 --> 22:46.766
(door opens and closes)
 (pants)

22:46.766 --> 22:50.440
TOOK A SHOWER,
BRUSHED MY TEETH.

22:50.440 --> 22:54.504
WE ARE GOOD TO GO.

22:54.504 --> 22:56.746
MMM.

22:56.746 --> 22:57.847
LYNETTE.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.653
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:03.653 --> 23:05.615
YOU KNOW, THE PACT.

23:05.615 --> 23:07.016
OH.

23:07.016 --> 23:09.018
DIDN'T WE ALREADY DO IT
TONIGHT?

23:09.018 --> 23:10.590
(chuckles) NO.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.863
OH, THEY'RE ALL STARTING
TO BLUR.
 (moans)

23:13.863 --> 23:16.165
LOOK, I WORKED TILL 3:00 A.M.
LAST NIGHT.

23:16.165 --> 23:19.068
I'M EXHAUSTED. HOW ABOUT
WE TAKE A RAIN CHECK?

23:19.068 --> 23:21.771
A RAIN CHECK?
 MM.

23:21.771 --> 23:23.673
THIS ISN'T BASEBALL.

23:23.673 --> 23:26.706
EVERY NIGHT FOR 30 DAYS--
THAT'S THE LAW.

23:26.706 --> 23:31.010
TOM,
I HAVE A 7:00 A.M. MEETING.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.082
HOW ABOUT
I TAKE A LONG LUNCH,

23:33.082 --> 23:36.045
AND YOU DO ME TWICE AT WORK
TOMORROW?

23:36.045 --> 23:37.517
COME ON.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.889
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

23:39.889 --> 23:42.091
OKAY.

23:42.091 --> 23:43.723
OKAY.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.995
WE'LL HAVE SEX.

23:45.995 --> 23:47.997
BUT CAN YOU MAKE IT QUICK?

23:47.997 --> 23:49.699
LYNETTE, PLEASE.

23:49.699 --> 23:51.701
YOU CAN'T RUSH AN ARTIST.

23:51.701 --> 23:53.062
MMM.

23:53.062 --> 23:54.804
MMM.

23:54.804 --> 23:58.067
(moaning)

24:02.011 --> 24:05.975
(snoring)

24:12.682 --> 24:15.454
MORNING. OH, SORRY. I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.487
(dishes clatter)
 GOOD.
I DIDN'T MAKE YOU ANY.

24:17.487 --> 24:19.759
OH, OKAY.
UH, COFFEE WILL BE FINE.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.832
BEANS ARE RIGHT THERE.
GRAB A HANDFUL AND GRIND.

24:22.832 --> 24:25.094
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

24:27.236 --> 24:29.769
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

24:29.769 --> 24:32.171
LAST NIGHT,
WE WERE HAVING SEX?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.003
YOU FELL ASLEEP?

24:35.745 --> 24:36.846
AFTER?

24:36.846 --> 24:38.147
DURING.

24:38.147 --> 24:40.650
OH.

24:40.650 --> 24:42.982
WAS IT GOOD? (chuckles)

24:42.982 --> 24:45.785
I DIDN'T FINISH.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.618
GOD, YOU RUINED OUR STREAK,
LYNETTE.

24:48.618 --> 24:51.521
I'M SORRY. I WAS EXHAUSTED.

24:51.521 --> 24:54.524
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS
ASKING YOU TO SCRUB A FLOOR.

24:54.524 --> 24:57.997
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
LIE THERE, LIKE YOU USUALLY DO.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.701
OH, OKAY. I'M GONNA LET THAT ONE
GO, 'CAUSE YOU'RE UPSET.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.172
WELL, IT'S TRUE.

25:03.172 --> 25:05.234
WITH YOU BEING SO TIRED
FROM WORK LATELY,

25:05.234 --> 25:07.837
I'M THE ONE DOING
ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING.

25:07.837 --> 25:09.839
TOM, YOU'RE BEING
COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.

25:09.839 --> 25:11.941
WE'VE HAD SEX
23 DAYS STRAIGHT.

25:11.941 --> 25:15.244
I'VE SEEN MORE CEILING
THAN MICHELANGELO.
 WE MADE A COMMITMENT, LYNETTE.
THE BOOK SAYS--

25:15.244 --> 25:17.246
OH, WOULD YOU STOP
WITH THE BOOK?

25:17.246 --> 25:19.889
YOU BOUGHT IT AT A CAR WASH

25:19.889 --> 25:23.192
ALONG WITH A PACK OF GUM
AND AN AIR FRESHENER.
 YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S STUPID.
ALL MY IDEAS ARE STUPID.

25:23.192 --> 25:27.096
I SHOULD JUST STICK
TO DOING CHORES.
 DON'T JUST WALK AWAY.

25:27.096 --> 25:29.959
YOU BETTER GET TO WORK, LYNETTE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

25:35.204 --> 25:37.967
HEY. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU BOYS
IN A WHILE.

25:37.967 --> 25:40.309
THERE'S BEEN A BREAK IN THE CLUB
FIRE CASE, MR. WILLIAMS.

25:40.309 --> 25:41.871
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

25:41.871 --> 25:44.614
(Detective Collins)
DO YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

25:44.614 --> 25:47.276
NO. WHO IS HE?

25:47.276 --> 25:49.579
DR. SAMUEL HELLER,
PSYCHIATRIST FROM BOSTON.

25:49.579 --> 25:51.751
HE'S THE GUY WHO BURNED UP
IN THE FIRE.

25:51.751 --> 25:54.924
WHAT'S A SHRINK FROM BOSTON
DOING IN FAIRVIEW?

25:54.924 --> 25:57.256
NO IDEA,
BUT WE'D LIKE TO FIND OUT

25:57.256 --> 26:00.259
IF ANYONE KNOWS HIM
OR WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE.

26:00.259 --> 26:04.563
DID YOU SEE HIM BACKSTAGE?
 NO, I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY.

26:06.836 --> 26:08.738
EXCEPT PORTER SCAVO.

26:08.738 --> 26:12.201
YEAH, BUT I TOLD YOU.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

26:15.344 --> 26:17.346
DO YOU KNOW A GUY NAMED
JACKSON BRADDOCK?

26:17.346 --> 26:20.710
HE WAS BACKSTAGE.
 WAS HE?

26:20.710 --> 26:22.682
YEAH, HE GOT LOCKED
IN THE EMPLOYEE MEN'S ROOM

26:22.682 --> 26:25.915
RIGHT BEFORE
THE FIRE STARTED.
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

26:25.915 --> 26:28.618
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM?
 WE'VE BEEN TRYING,

26:28.618 --> 26:31.220
BUT HE LEFT TOWN, AND WE'VE BEEN
UNABLE TO FIND HIM.

26:31.220 --> 26:35.594
THAT'S A SHAME.
 WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.166
YOU BET.

26:41.731 --> 26:43.002
(beep)

26:43.002 --> 26:45.735
(dials)

26:45.735 --> 26:47.737
(door closes)

26:47.737 --> 26:49.238
HEY, SUSAN. IT'S DAVE.

26:49.238 --> 26:52.241
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
I'D PICK UP YOU AND M.J.

26:52.241 --> 26:54.744
AROUND 6:00 A.M. SATURDAY
FOR THE TRIP.

26:54.744 --> 26:58.347
YEAH. I FIGURED THE EARLIER
WE GET GOING, THE BETTER.

26:58.347 --> 27:00.389
OKAY.

27:00.389 --> 27:02.621
(beep)

27:02.621 --> 27:06.195
WELL, HELLO THERE, M.J.

27:06.195 --> 27:08.157
I WAS BAKING THIS MORNING,
AND LIKE AN IDIOT,

27:08.157 --> 27:10.159
I MADE TOO MANY MACAROONS.

27:10.159 --> 27:12.161
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO TAKE ONE?

27:12.161 --> 27:15.164
I WOULD HATE TO SEE THEM
GO TO WASTE.
 MACAROONS ARE MY FAVORITE.

27:15.164 --> 27:18.668
OH, REALLY?
WHAT A DELIGHTFUL COINCIDENCE.

27:18.668 --> 27:21.671
YOU KNOW, I COULD BAKE THESE
FOR YOU EVERY WEEK,

27:21.671 --> 27:25.074
AND ALL I'D NEED IN RETURN IS
JUST THE TINIEST OF FAVORS.

27:25.074 --> 27:26.375
WHAT KIND OF FAVOR?

27:26.375 --> 27:29.078
INVITE EVAN MAYER
TO YOUR SLEEPOVER.

27:29.078 --> 27:31.280
I DON'T LIKE EVAN.
HE'S MEAN.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.282
OH, NO.

27:33.282 --> 27:35.885
DEEP DOWN,
HE'S JUST A FRAGILE LITTLE BOY

27:35.885 --> 27:38.758
WHO WANTS TO BE LIKED.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.990
HE HIT ME
WITH A DEAD SQUIRREL.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.963
NOW, M.J., WE CAN FIND FAULTS
WITH ALL OUR FRIENDS

27:43.963 --> 27:45.194
IF WE NITPICK.

27:45.194 --> 27:47.767
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WILL YOU INVITE HIM?

27:49.398 --> 27:51.901
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME ICE CREAM
WITH YOUR MACAROONS?

27:51.901 --> 27:54.103
BECAUSE I COULD MAKE THAT
HAPPEN.

27:54.103 --> 27:56.005
BREE?

27:56.005 --> 27:57.977
I'M LATE FOR MY GOLF GAME.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.679
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GO TO THE A.T.M.,

28:00.679 --> 28:05.715
SO I TOOK THE CASH
OUT OF YOUR WALLET.

28:05.715 --> 28:08.057
BYE.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.021
(sighs)

28:16.025 --> 28:19.468
M.J.,
THERE'S SOMEONE IN MY LIFE

28:19.468 --> 28:22.331
WHO HITS ME
 WITH A DEAD SQUIRREL

28:22.331 --> 28:25.805
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

28:25.805 --> 28:29.178
AND YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN HELP ME.

28:29.178 --> 28:33.142
PLEASE, PLEASE INVITE EVAN
TO YOUR PARTY.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.116
OKAY.

28:37.116 --> 28:40.489
(whispers) THANK YOU.

28:40.489 --> 28:42.822
OH, THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

28:45.895 --> 28:51.300
BOY, THE STUFF I DO
FOR MACAROONS.

28:51.300 --> 28:54.433
(doorbell rings)

28:59.869 --> 29:02.772
GO AWAY! I-I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

29:02.772 --> 29:04.513
COME ON. LET ME IN.

29:04.513 --> 29:06.816
THANKS, BUT I'VE REACHED
MY MAXIMUM ALLOWANCE

29:06.816 --> 29:09.148
FOR HUMILIATION THIS WEEK.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.321
LISTEN, I'M SORRY YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS A REAL PROPOSAL.

29:12.321 --> 29:15.484
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
I'D MOVED ON.

29:15.484 --> 29:18.457
MAXIMUM ALLOWANCE EXCEEDED.

29:21.490 --> 29:22.992
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:22.992 --> 29:26.836
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE. YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BE MAD AT ME.

29:26.836 --> 29:29.168
OH, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

29:29.168 --> 29:32.141
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.

29:33.803 --> 29:36.505
I WAS A LITTLE LONELY
AND A LITTLE AFRAID

29:36.505 --> 29:41.851
AND... I JUST DID
WHAT I ALWAYS DO--

29:41.851 --> 29:45.214
LET SOME SILLY ROMANTIC FANTASY
TAKE OVER.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.889
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU STILL FELT
THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

29:51.821 --> 29:53.462
I DON'T.

29:53.462 --> 29:55.464
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

29:55.464 --> 29:57.426
NOT REALLY.

29:57.426 --> 30:02.131
AND BESIDES, YOU MOVED ON.

30:02.131 --> 30:04.974
WELL, I HAD TO.

30:04.974 --> 30:07.506
YOU PUSHED ME AWAY.

30:07.506 --> 30:11.340
I HAD TO... HEAL MY HEART
AND GET OVER IT.

30:16.215 --> 30:20.549
THIS--I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO

30:20.549 --> 30:23.092
TO STAY HERE
AND DO YOUR WORK?

30:23.092 --> 30:24.954
YEAH.

30:34.964 --> 30:36.866
I'LL HELP YOU.

30:36.866 --> 30:38.437
REALLY?

30:38.437 --> 30:41.610
YEAH.
 (sets flowers down)

30:41.610 --> 30:44.143
I'LL DO IT. BUT THAT'S IT.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.416
NO LOVE, NO SEX, JUST...

30:47.416 --> 30:48.978
MARRIAGE.

30:48.978 --> 30:50.950
NO SEX?

30:50.950 --> 30:55.885
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THIS
IS A REAL MARRIAGE, DON'T YOU?

31:03.032 --> 31:06.095
(indistinct conversations)

31:09.598 --> 31:11.270
GABY, COME ON.

31:14.974 --> 31:18.147
FOR GOD SAKES, WILL YOU TAKE
THOSE OFF? IT'S 8:00 AT NIGHT.

31:18.147 --> 31:21.150
OH, FINE. AS LONG AS YOU
DON'T MIND PEOPLE THINKING

31:21.150 --> 31:24.083
YOU'RE OUT ON THE TOWN WITH
YOUR ANEMIC LESBIAN SISTER.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.056
THERE'S OUR MAN OF HONOR.
(chuckles)

31:27.056 --> 31:29.058
(chuckles)
GABY, THIS IS STEPHANIE.

31:29.058 --> 31:32.121
SHE PUT THIS WHOLE BANQUET
TOGETHER.
 HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

31:32.121 --> 31:35.664
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
WHY I LOOK LIKE THIS.
 EXCUSE ME?

31:35.664 --> 31:37.666
I'M NOT ILL.
I'M JUST NOT WEARING ANY MAKEUP

31:37.666 --> 31:40.669
SO I CAN TEACH MY DAUGHTER THAT
BEAUTY'S WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE.

31:40.669 --> 31:43.272
I DON'T ACTUALLY LOOK
THIS HIDEOUS.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.375
OKAY.

31:49.979 --> 31:52.181
WILL YOU PLEASE
STOP EXPLAINING YOURSELF?

31:52.181 --> 31:55.144
I MEAN, IT WAS BAD ENOUGH
WHEN YOU DID IT WITH THE VALET.
 I CAN'T HELP IT.

31:55.144 --> 31:57.947
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE THINKING
I CONDONE THIS FACE.

31:57.947 --> 32:01.620
I'M GONNA GO FIND OUR TABLE.

32:04.593 --> 32:05.995
CHAMPAGNE?

32:05.995 --> 32:07.396
OH, THANK YOU.

32:07.396 --> 32:11.160
I'M NOT ILL. I'M JUST
NOT WEARING ANY MAKEUP.
 (Carlos) GABY!

32:11.160 --> 32:12.661
GOTTA GO.

32:14.403 --> 32:17.967
(party favors honk,
children shouting)

32:17.967 --> 32:20.239
COME ON, GUYS.
NO RUNNING IN THE HOUSE.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.271
THESE CANDY APPLES ARE GREAT.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.343
CAN ME AND EVAN
HAVE ANOTHER ONE?

32:24.343 --> 32:26.345
WELL,
I BETTER ASK KATHERINE.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.476
WHERE IS KATHERINE?

32:31.180 --> 32:34.153
HEY.
YOU'RE MISSING ALL THE FUN.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.725
I JUST GOT A CANDIED APPLE
OUT OF A KID'S HAIR.

32:36.725 --> 32:40.289
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

32:40.289 --> 32:42.161
NO, COME ON DOWN.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.633
IT'S NOT AS MUCH FUN
WITHOUT YOU.

32:44.633 --> 32:47.396
OKAY.

32:47.396 --> 32:50.469
YOU WERE HONEST WITH ME,
SO I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

32:52.241 --> 32:54.243
I GOT SCARED.

32:56.045 --> 32:58.677
OF WHAT?

32:58.677 --> 33:03.682
I WAS HOSTING A PARTY
WITH THIS AMAZING MAN

33:03.682 --> 33:06.355
AND HIS ADORABLE SON,

33:06.355 --> 33:08.357
AND WE WERE LIKE
THE PERFECT FAMILY,

33:08.357 --> 33:10.259
AND THEN I REALIZED...

33:10.259 --> 33:12.091
WE'RE NOT A FAMILY.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.523
IT COULD ALL GO AWAY
IN AN INSTANT.

33:16.525 --> 33:18.627
KATHERINE, I'M NOT LEAVING.

33:18.627 --> 33:21.700
BUT YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING
EITHER.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.334
WHY NOT, MIKE?

33:25.334 --> 33:27.476
IS IT SUSAN?

33:27.476 --> 33:31.040
YOU STILL IN LOVE WITH HER?

33:31.040 --> 33:32.311
NO.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.313
NO, I'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

33:34.313 --> 33:37.416
THEN IT MUST BE ME.

33:37.416 --> 33:42.121
KATHERINE, I LOVE
HAVING YOU IN MY LIFE.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.693
I'M JUST NOT READY.

33:44.693 --> 33:47.326
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

33:47.326 --> 33:51.700
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU
TO SAY ANYTHING.

33:51.700 --> 33:55.064
I JUST HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

33:57.666 --> 33:59.508
(crash and laughter)

33:59.508 --> 34:05.144
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO MAKE SURE
THE FIRST FLOOR IS STILL THERE.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.482
EXCUSE ME.
THE MAYOR'S ABOUT TO LEAVE,

34:13.482 --> 34:16.455
AND THE NEWSPAPER WANTS A PHOTO
WITH HIM AND YOUR FAMILY.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.456
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
(chuckles)

34:18.456 --> 34:22.491
TELL HIM NO WAY IN HELL.
 TELL HIM
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

34:22.491 --> 34:24.463
THE NEWSPAPER? FORGET IT.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.735
GABY, I DO BUSINESS
WITH THE CITY.

34:26.735 --> 34:30.268
I CAN'T JUST BLOW OFF
THE MAYOR.
 SERIOUSLY, WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS
TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.271
NEXT TIME
THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC,

34:32.271 --> 34:34.303
PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK
I'M PATIENT ZERO.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.447
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
OUT OF THIS.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.779
FINE.

34:40.779 --> 34:44.081
BUT JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR, YOU'RE
ALSO LATINO JERK OF THE YEAR.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.813
COME ON. LET'S GO.

34:45.813 --> 34:47.856
OH, CAN I AT LEAST
USE THE BATHROOM FIRST?

34:47.856 --> 34:49.658
(sighs)

34:51.460 --> 34:55.224
LADIES! ATTENTION, PLEASE.

34:55.224 --> 34:59.398
I AM IN A JAM, AND I NEED
LIPSTICK AND EYELINER.

34:59.398 --> 35:02.301
COME ON. CHOP CHOP.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.673
YOU CAN USE MY MAKEUP.

35:04.673 --> 35:08.307
OH, THAT DOESN'T REALLY GO
WITH MY SKIN TONE.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.509
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE HAVE THE SAME COLORING.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.242
YEAH, IT DOESN'T REALLY GO
WITH YOUR SKIN TONE EITHER,

35:13.242 --> 35:16.345
BUT I CAN ONLY DEAL
WITH ONE DISASTER AT A TIME.

35:16.345 --> 35:18.817
OOH. ASIAN GIRL.
CLOSE ENOUGH.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.719
UM, I DON'T THINK SO.

35:20.719 --> 35:24.122
UGH. WAS IT THE "CHOP CHOP"
THING? FINE. I'M SORRY.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.124
NOW CAN I BORROW SOME BLUSH?

35:26.124 --> 35:29.258
I DON'T SHARE COSMETICS.
I'M SORT OF A GERM FREAK.

35:29.258 --> 35:33.662
OH, DON'T WORRY.
I'M AS HEALTHY AS A HORSE.
 REALLY? YOU LOOK SICK.

35:33.662 --> 35:36.765
THAT'S 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANY MAKEUP!

35:36.765 --> 35:39.508
I SAID NO.
NOW LEAVE ME ALONE.

35:39.508 --> 35:42.241
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK.
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.872
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
 (gasps)

35:43.872 --> 35:45.474
OH.

35:45.474 --> 35:47.346
OH! HEY!

35:47.346 --> 35:50.319
COME OUT NOW,
OR I'LL CALL SECURITY!

35:50.319 --> 35:53.322
YOU KNOW, FOR A WOMAN WHO HAS
A PURSE FULL OF DINNER ROLLS,

35:53.322 --> 35:56.154
YOU SURE HAVE
A LOT OF ATTITUDE.

35:57.826 --> 36:01.460
OH, GOOD. WE'RE ALL HERE.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.393
BY THE WAY, MRS. SOLIS,
YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.

36:04.393 --> 36:06.495
THANK YOU.

36:06.495 --> 36:09.438
YEAH, MOM. YOU LOOK GREAT.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.872
OKAY, BIG SMILES, EVERYONE.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.345
(camera shutter snaps)

36:20.879 --> 36:22.581
SEE THIS?

36:22.581 --> 36:24.683
MY THIRD ESPRESSO.
 (thud)

36:24.683 --> 36:28.217
I'M WIRED. NO WAY
I'M FALLING ASLEEP TONIGHT.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.324
HEY.

36:35.324 --> 36:38.797
HOW ABOUT WE THROW A PIZZA
ON THE FRONT LAWN,

36:38.797 --> 36:40.969
AND WHEN THE KIDS
RUN OUT TO GET IT,

36:40.969 --> 36:44.903
WE LOCK THE DOOR AND DO IT
IN EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE?

36:48.677 --> 36:52.641
TOM, I'M SORRY.

36:52.641 --> 36:54.743
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

36:54.743 --> 36:57.816
IF YOU WANNA STAY MAD,
I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA STAY MAD.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.789
(sighs)

37:00.789 --> 37:03.792
I AM NOT MAD, LYNETTE.

37:03.792 --> 37:04.923
THEN WHAT'S WRONG?

37:04.923 --> 37:07.296
YOU'RE GONNA THINK
IT'S STUPID.

37:07.296 --> 37:08.727
TELL ME.

37:10.859 --> 37:12.861
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY SEX

37:12.861 --> 37:14.933
HAS BECOME SO IMPORTANT
TO ME LATELY?

37:14.933 --> 37:18.867
BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE ONLY THING IN MY LIFE

37:18.867 --> 37:20.739
THAT I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.912
THAT IS SO SWEET.

37:23.912 --> 37:27.476
NO. NO, IT'S NOT GOOD, LYNETTE--
NOT FOR ME, NOT FOR YOU.

37:27.476 --> 37:28.747
I...

37:28.747 --> 37:32.951
I NEED SOMETHING ELSE
TO BE EXCITED ABOUT.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.954
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DO THIS,
TO TAKE A BREAK AND STAY HOME.

37:35.954 --> 37:40.689
I DID. YOU KNOW, I FIGURED,
THE KIDS ARE GROWN...

37:40.689 --> 37:42.661
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSE
AND THE ERRANDS,

37:42.661 --> 37:44.893
AND IT'LL BE EASY,
AND IT IS.

37:44.893 --> 37:46.895
IT'S TOO DAMN EASY.

37:46.895 --> 37:49.868
I AM FINISHED WITH MY WORK
BY NOON,

37:49.868 --> 37:52.901
AND THEN I JUST SIT AROUND,

37:52.901 --> 37:55.304
WAITING FOR YOU TO COME HOME.

37:55.304 --> 37:56.305
SO...

37:56.305 --> 37:58.407
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? HMM?

37:58.407 --> 38:01.910
WHAT ARE YOU
PASSIONATE ABOUT?

38:01.910 --> 38:04.713
I DON'T KNOW.

38:06.815 --> 38:08.817
I'M A MIDDLE-AGED GUY,

38:08.817 --> 38:12.561
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

38:15.694 --> 38:18.367
I TOLD YOU IT WAS STUPID.

38:18.367 --> 38:20.999
NO.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.773
NO.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.816
HEY.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.793
I KNOW I DISAPPOINTED YOU
TONIGHT, AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

38:44.793 --> 38:47.996
IT'S OKAY.
I KNOW WHY YOU DID IT.

38:47.996 --> 38:50.559
I NEED MAKEUP, TOO.

38:50.559 --> 38:54.032
HONEY, I KNOW
YOU THINK BEING PRETTY

38:54.032 --> 38:56.905
SEEMS LIKE THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,

38:56.905 --> 38:58.907
BUT BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOT.

38:58.907 --> 39:01.510
YOU WERE A MODEL.

39:01.510 --> 39:03.041
(sighs)

39:03.041 --> 39:07.115
YES, I WAS.

39:07.115 --> 39:09.478
AND MY WHOLE LIFE,

39:09.478 --> 39:11.750
PEOPLE TOLD ME
HOW PRETTY I WAS.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.051
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:13.051 --> 39:16.084
I NEVER THOUGHT
I HAD TO WORK HARD IN SCHOOL

39:16.084 --> 39:18.056
OR WORK ON FRIENDSHIPS

39:18.056 --> 39:21.129
OR MY PERSONALITY--
NONE OF IT.

39:21.129 --> 39:23.131
AND THEN I STOPPED MODELING,

39:23.131 --> 39:26.395
AND I REALIZED I DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH ON THE INSIDE.

39:26.395 --> 39:29.798
AND I DON'T WANT THAT
FOR YOU.

39:31.369 --> 39:36.805
I WANT YOU TO BE BRAVE
AND FUNNY AND CREATIVE...

39:36.805 --> 39:40.449
TO BE MORE
THAN JUST A SHELL.

39:40.449 --> 39:43.512
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE WHOLE RICH, GOOEY CENTER.

39:47.055 --> 39:49.558
WILL YOU PROMISE TO DO THAT
FOR YOURSELF?

39:51.159 --> 39:52.721
OKAY.

39:55.464 --> 39:56.825
(kisses)

39:58.396 --> 40:01.029
WHEN DO I GET TO WEAR MAKEUP?

40:04.503 --> 40:06.875
I TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU CAN WEAR MAKEUP

40:06.875 --> 40:09.638
THE DAY YOU REALIZE
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED IT.

40:22.190 --> 40:23.522
HEY.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.524
I BOUGHT M.J.
A FISHING POLE.

40:25.524 --> 40:28.156
I FIGURE I'D TEACH
THE LITTLE GUY HOW TO CAST

40:28.156 --> 40:31.460
BEFORE WE HIT THE WATER.
 OH, MY GOD. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO MAKE IT THIS WEEKEND.

40:31.460 --> 40:34.002
I'M KIND OF...

40:34.002 --> 40:35.864
(sighs)
GETTING MARRIED.

40:35.864 --> 40:38.066
WHAT? (chuckles)

40:38.066 --> 40:39.568
TO WHO?

40:39.568 --> 40:41.209
(Jackson) DAVE WILLIAMS.

40:41.209 --> 40:43.712
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU
OUT HERE.

40:43.712 --> 40:45.744
JACKSON.
 (chuckles)

40:45.744 --> 40:49.077
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WAS
OUT OF THE PICTURE, I'M BACK.
 (chuckles)

40:53.622 --> 40:56.124
SINCE YOU HELD UP
YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN,

40:56.124 --> 40:58.126
I'M GOING TO HOLD UP MINE.

40:58.126 --> 41:01.129
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU
WALK AWAY FROM THIS MARRIAGE

41:01.129 --> 41:03.131
WITH YOUR BUSINESS
AND YOUR ASSETS INTACT.

41:03.131 --> 41:04.633
NOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS,

41:04.633 --> 41:07.496
I MAY NEED YOU TO LIE,
STONEWALL,

41:07.496 --> 41:10.198
EVEN RESORT
TO SOME OUTRIGHT TRICKERY.

41:10.198 --> 41:12.470
MY QUESTION IS...

41:12.470 --> 41:14.603
WILL YOU BE UP FOR THAT?

41:17.806 --> 41:21.249
I USED TO THINK OF MYSELF
AS A GOOD PERSON.

41:21.249 --> 41:27.485
IF I HAD A CHOICE, I WOULD
ALWAYS CHOOSE THE HIGH ROAD.

41:27.485 --> 41:32.621
LATELY I'VE BEGUN
TO REALIZE THAT, UM...

41:32.621 --> 41:36.224
I'M CAPABLE OF DOING
WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE.

41:36.224 --> 41:38.997
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MAKES YOU?

41:40.599 --> 41:42.871
THE PERFECT CLIENT.

41:42.871 --> 41:44.132
(chuckles)

41:48.837 --> 41:50.539
ON THIS STREET,

41:50.539 --> 41:54.182
THE BARGAINING IS FINISHED
BY SUNDOWN...

41:56.244 --> 41:58.817
A DAUGHTER AGREES
TO GO TO BED EARLY

41:58.817 --> 42:03.652
IF HER MOTHER LETS HER DRESS UP
IN HER OLD GOWNS...

42:03.652 --> 42:07.525
A WOMAN AGREES TO LET
HER FIANCé SPEND THE NIGHT

42:07.525 --> 42:12.300
IF HE'LL AGREE
TO SLEEP ON THE SOFA...

42:12.300 --> 42:15.764
A MAN ALLOWS HIS LOVER
TO GET CLOSE

42:15.764 --> 42:19.568
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T DISCUSS
THE FUTURE.

42:21.670 --> 42:27.215
YES, EVERYONE KNOWS HOW
TO BARGAIN ON WISTERIA LANE...

42:27.215 --> 42:29.277
HI.

42:29.277 --> 42:31.820
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
SO LATE?

42:31.820 --> 42:33.952
WELL, I HAVE
A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.156
I'LL MAKE YOU BREAKFAST
IN THE MORNING

42:38.156 --> 42:40.629
IF YOU MAKE LOVE TO ME
TONIGHT.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.663
WHY NOT?

42:46.765 --> 42:49.067
BUT SOMETIMES...

42:49.067 --> 42:53.672
THEY GET MORE THAN
THEY BARGAINED FOR.
