01:35.918 --> 01:38.118
Father?

01:38.918 --> 01:40.917
Can I ask for your guidance?

01:40.918 --> 01:43.917
Please?

01:43.918 --> 01:46.118
I'll try to be helpful if I can.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.917
Okay, I have to tell you,

01:51.918 --> 01:53.917
I'm not religious, okay?

01:53.918 --> 01:56.917
I'm spiritual.

01:56.918 --> 01:58.911
I'm a musician,

01:58.918 --> 01:59.917
I find my spirituality

01:59.918 --> 02:01.917
through all the things that
are much more powerful

02:01.918 --> 02:03.078
than anything you guys do.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.917
But, uh... my God is music.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.917
Yeah?

02:07.918 --> 02:10.917
God appears in many ways.

02:10.918 --> 02:13.118
Yes. Yeah, it does.

02:13.918 --> 02:16.917
And...

02:16.918 --> 02:22.118
Have you ever felt
this dreadful passion?

02:24.420 --> 02:25.917
I...

02:25.918 --> 02:28.917
Close my eyes and I see her.

02:28.918 --> 02:30.917
I see her eyes.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.917
Her lips.

02:33.918 --> 02:35.917
I...

02:35.918 --> 02:37.917
She's coming.

02:37.918 --> 02:39.917
She's coming to town and

02:39.918 --> 02:43.917
I want to rid myself of this feeling,

02:43.918 --> 02:47.917
of this overwhelming feeling.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.917
Well, my relationship is with Jesus.

02:51.918 --> 02:54.917
So girlfriend advice isn't
really my specialty.

02:54.918 --> 02:56.917
But I can say that

02:56.918 --> 02:58.917
it is wise to keep inner strength when

02:58.918 --> 03:00.917
when in the presence of temptation

03:00.918 --> 03:04.917
through the death and
resurrection of our God.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.917
I grant you pardon and absolution.

03:07.918 --> 03:11.917
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

03:11.918 --> 03:12.917
Amen.

03:12.918 --> 03:14.917
Um...

03:14.918 --> 03:16.118
I'm not confessing.

03:16.918 --> 03:18.917
I thought that...

03:18.918 --> 03:20.917
But uh...

03:20.918 --> 03:25.917
Thank you, it's, uh...

03:25.918 --> 03:27.917
I...

03:27.918 --> 03:29.358
So I just have to remain strong

03:29.918 --> 03:30.917
but I can still be around her?

03:30.918 --> 03:33.917
I'm not exactly sure
that was my meaning.

03:33.918 --> 03:35.917
That works.

03:35.918 --> 03:37.917
I mean, I got it.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.917
Thank you. That's actually really good.

03:40.918 --> 03:42.917
- Oh.
- Makes sense. Thank you.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.118
Thank you, thank you.

03:47.918 --> 03:49.917
Just don't tell your union rep.

03:49.918 --> 03:51.917
What if I told you I am the union rep?

03:51.918 --> 03:53.917
I still can't believe they
needed multiple oboes

03:53.918 --> 03:54.917
for a small horror film.

03:54.918 --> 03:56.917
What are the chances?

03:56.918 --> 03:58.917
I was going for a real vintage
Elmer Bernstein thing.

03:58.918 --> 03:59.917
Oh.

03:59.918 --> 04:02.917
A period contemporary mind fuck, you know?

04:02.918 --> 04:06.917
Would you ever be up for hearing
some more of my demos?

04:06.918 --> 04:08.917
Over drinks?

04:08.918 --> 04:10.917
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm
actually extremely busy.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.917
So I wouldn't be able
to hear them, you know?

04:12.918 --> 04:13.917
Absolutely.

04:13.918 --> 04:15.917
Forgive me for my ardor.

04:15.918 --> 04:18.916
It's as much of a
liability as a strength.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.118
Hmm. Bye.

04:21.918 --> 04:23.244
I'm going to remember that line.

04:23.245 --> 04:25.917
That wasn't bad, right?

04:25.918 --> 04:27.917
Play some music, watch a movie.

04:27.918 --> 04:29.917
You know, I can promise you,
any jobs I can throw your way,

04:29.918 --> 04:30.917
from now on I will.

04:30.918 --> 04:33.917
I'd really appreciate it.
I just want to play.

04:33.918 --> 04:35.917
I once had a session where
I spent the entire day

04:35.918 --> 04:37.917
playing a Moog synthesizer with one hand

04:37.918 --> 04:39.917
while rolling joints with the other hand.

04:39.918 --> 04:42.917
I think the movie took place in space

04:42.918 --> 04:43.917
or was it Africa?

04:43.918 --> 04:46.917
Or maybe I was just fucking spaced out?

04:46.918 --> 04:47.917
See you, DD.

04:47.918 --> 04:49.118
Bye, guys.

04:49.918 --> 04:51.917
Hey.

04:51.918 --> 04:53.917
You girls want to go grab a bite?

04:53.918 --> 04:54.917
I'm not really hungry.

04:54.918 --> 04:57.917
I have to wash off after the indignity

04:57.918 --> 04:59.703
of working on that piece of crap film.

04:59.918 --> 05:02.917
Yeah, I feel like I should call my
sister and tell her I love her.

05:02.918 --> 05:05.369
No, I can't. Alex is doing
a showcase tonight.

05:05.918 --> 05:07.917
I'm glad to see this Alex
thing is really working out.

05:07.918 --> 05:08.917
Yeah, well, we'll see.

05:08.918 --> 05:10.704
You know, on second thought,

05:10.705 --> 05:11.918
I could maybe eat a little something.

05:11.919 --> 05:15.118
My treat, of course, Cyn.

05:23.918 --> 05:25.917
Is this...

05:25.918 --> 05:26.918
a real evil eye?

05:26.919 --> 05:28.917
Absolutely, dude. Straight from Athens.

05:28.918 --> 05:30.917
It'll ward off anything.

05:30.918 --> 05:31.917
Used to have a whole store up.

05:31.918 --> 05:33.917
Chipotle bought us out.

05:33.918 --> 05:35.917
Do you have anything that's stronger?

05:35.918 --> 05:37.917
You mean like witchcraft?

05:37.918 --> 05:40.118
I was thinking more like sage.

05:40.918 --> 05:41.917
[laughing]

05:41.918 --> 05:44.917
Well, Betty,

05:44.918 --> 05:46.917
I have to ask you something,

05:46.918 --> 05:47.917
and don't get mad.

05:47.918 --> 05:48.917
Fire away.

05:48.918 --> 05:51.917
Have you ever thought about
just being nice to Hailey?

05:51.918 --> 05:54.917
Let me give it a shot.

05:54.918 --> 05:56.917
Yeah, that's not gonna happen, Cyn.

05:56.918 --> 05:58.917
Betty, she's harmless.

05:58.918 --> 06:01.917
Yeah, harmless as a puppy with fleas.

06:01.918 --> 06:03.917
Take your eye off her,

06:03.918 --> 06:05.917
and the symphony will suddenly
be filled with sorority girls

06:05.918 --> 06:06.917
who dabble in music.

06:06.918 --> 06:09.917
Plus, you know, mentoring's
not really my jam.

06:09.918 --> 06:11.917
Can we have a check, please?

06:11.918 --> 06:13.917
You remember how hard it
was when we started out?

06:13.918 --> 06:15.917
Give her a break.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.917
Why? I didn't get one.

06:17.918 --> 06:21.917
When I started out, I was one
of six women in this symphony.

06:21.918 --> 06:23.917
When Catherine Lee got pregnant,

06:23.918 --> 06:25.917
they had no fucking idea
what maternity leave was.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.917
They just let her go.

06:27.918 --> 06:29.917
I mean, it absolutely infuriates
me hearing these kids

06:29.918 --> 06:32.917
complain about how hard they have it.

06:32.918 --> 06:34.118
I mean, shut up.

06:34.918 --> 06:36.917
Go cry some place else.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.917
I mean, I got where I was because
of my talent and my hard work.

06:39.918 --> 06:41.358
- Hear you are, ma'am.
- Thanks.

06:41.918 --> 06:42.917
- No.
- Betty.

06:42.918 --> 06:44.917
I said it was my treat.

06:44.918 --> 06:46.118
Thanks.

06:50.918 --> 06:51.917
How bad is it?

06:51.918 --> 06:53.917
What?

06:53.918 --> 06:56.118
Your wrist? Tendonitis.

06:59.918 --> 07:00.918
It's that obvious, huh?

07:00.919 --> 07:03.118
It's obvious to me.

07:05.918 --> 07:06.917
What are you on?

07:06.918 --> 07:10.118
A nice cocktail of Grey
Goose and a mild steroid.

07:10.918 --> 07:12.917
- Ooh.
- I know, I'm no wallflower.

07:12.918 --> 07:16.917
Hey!

07:16.918 --> 07:18.917
- You little shit.
- Son of a bitch.

07:18.918 --> 07:19.917
- Fuck you, bitch.
- Fuck you!

07:19.918 --> 07:21.917
Ow!

07:21.918 --> 07:23.917
Are you okay?

07:23.918 --> 07:25.917
Yeah, thanks.

07:25.918 --> 07:27.917
Nice move.

07:27.918 --> 07:28.917
Just a reflex.

07:28.918 --> 07:32.917
Oh. I have some ice for that at home.

07:32.918 --> 07:34.118
Come on.

07:41.918 --> 07:42.917
(clears throat)

07:42.918 --> 07:43.917
Hi, everybody.

07:43.918 --> 07:46.917
So, what you're about to see

07:46.918 --> 07:48.917
is a work in progress.

07:48.918 --> 07:50.917
Emphasis on the word progress.

07:50.918 --> 07:54.173
Which, uh, on my note card here

07:54.174 --> 07:55.918
is written in capital
letters and underlined.

07:55.919 --> 07:58.917
I helped him come up with that.

07:58.918 --> 08:00.917
Okay, so a couple years
back Addison introduced me

08:00.918 --> 08:02.917
to a little book called Moby Dick.

08:02.918 --> 08:04.917
I... I just, I loved it,

08:04.918 --> 08:06.917
and I wanted to see if there was a way

08:06.918 --> 08:08.917
we could bring its epic scale

08:08.918 --> 08:11.917
to a more intimate
dimension with our bodies,

08:11.918 --> 08:14.547
and we're just now at a place where
we're looking to get some feedback.

08:14.547 --> 08:17.118
So, yeah, thank y'all
so much for being here.

08:22.918 --> 08:25.118
(acoustic guitar music)

08:34.918 --> 08:36.917
It's so cool, I've never seen him dance

08:36.918 --> 08:38.118
in front of an audience.

08:48.918 --> 08:51.917
Do you think he's meant
to be Captain Ahab?

08:51.918 --> 08:55.118
I think he's the albino sperm whale.

08:57.918 --> 08:58.917
That's good, right?

08:58.918 --> 09:00.917
They move really well together.

09:00.918 --> 09:04.118
Like brother and sister.

09:04.918 --> 09:08.917
[phone vibrates]

09:08.918 --> 09:10.917
Shit. _

09:10.918 --> 09:11.917
[singing in Spanish]

09:11.918 --> 09:14.118
Gotta go.

09:15.918 --> 09:16.917
Keep my eye on him.

09:16.918 --> 09:18.118
Yeah.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.917
Hello? Hello, Maestro?

09:30.918 --> 09:32.655
Hello, I need you to come meet me.

09:32.656 --> 09:33.917
I'll text you the address.

09:33.918 --> 09:36.917
Yes, of course. Yes, definitely.

09:36.918 --> 09:39.118
You know this is Hailey, right?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.118
Hailey! Hailey.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.344
Oh, Maestro, I'm so sorry I'm late.

09:48.345 --> 09:49.916
We have to be very
discreet tonight, okay?

09:49.917 --> 09:51.917
Very discreet, do you
understand what I'm saying?

09:51.918 --> 09:52.917
- Yes.
- Yes?

09:52.918 --> 09:54.917
Total discretion, got it.

09:54.918 --> 09:56.917
- Yes, strong, good.
- Man: Hailey?

09:56.918 --> 09:58.917
Okay, be strong, be brave.

09:58.918 --> 09:59.917
What? What, what?

09:59.918 --> 10:01.424
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
- What? Oh, fuck.

10:01.425 --> 10:03.917
Hailey Rutledge.

10:03.918 --> 10:04.917
Oh my God, hey.

10:04.918 --> 10:05.917
I didn't know you were in NY.

10:05.918 --> 10:09.917
Yeah, NY, it's so funny
that you call it that.

10:09.918 --> 10:10.917
How are you?

10:10.918 --> 10:11.917
I'm good. Man.

10:11.918 --> 10:14.892
At college, she turned me
onto Ayn Rand, it was like,

10:14.892 --> 10:16.118
[imitates explosion]

10:17.918 --> 10:20.118
Did you know that John
Cage once performed here?

10:20.918 --> 10:22.917
And, like, Philip Glass supposedly

10:22.918 --> 10:25.917
donated this keyboard that's
like 10 feet long or something?

10:25.918 --> 10:27.917
Philip Gla... I hate Philip Glass.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.917
You hate Philip Glass?

10:28.918 --> 10:29.917
Wow. Who is this guy?

10:29.918 --> 10:31.917
Is that like your boyfriend?

10:31.918 --> 10:33.917
- Boyfriend, girlfriend?
- No.

10:33.918 --> 10:36.118
Hey, I'm Derrick.

10:36.918 --> 10:37.917
- Is that...
- No, it's not.

10:37.918 --> 10:39.917
Derrick, it's so nice to see you.

10:39.918 --> 10:41.917
You have to go now.

10:41.918 --> 10:42.917
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:42.918 --> 10:45.118
Bye.

10:46.918 --> 10:47.917
Is he an old love of yours?

10:47.918 --> 10:49.917
Forgive me, I am so mortified right now.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.917
Ha. Ha ha.

10:51.918 --> 10:52.917
- Next.
- Okay, you're next.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.917
Oh.

10:54.918 --> 10:58.917
Hi, two tickets under Rodrigo de Souza.

10:58.918 --> 11:01.118
Okay, um...

11:01.918 --> 11:03.917
They're actually under Harmonic.

11:03.918 --> 11:04.917
- Phil.
- Phil.

11:04.918 --> 11:06.118
Phil Harmonic.

11:06.918 --> 11:08.917
Thank you so much.

11:08.918 --> 11:09.917
Next.

11:09.918 --> 11:10.917
Hey, I figured it out, man.

11:10.918 --> 11:11.917
I'm a really big fan.

11:11.918 --> 11:14.118
Thank you much. Thank you, thank you.

11:17.918 --> 11:18.917
- Hailey...
- Yes?

11:18.918 --> 11:20.917
Okay, listen to me, okay?

11:20.918 --> 11:21.621
Okay.

11:21.621 --> 11:23.221
Pay close attention to
what I'm going to say.

11:23.221 --> 11:23.917
- Yes.
- All right?

11:23.918 --> 11:25.917
Under no circumstance

11:25.918 --> 11:28.917
no matter what I say,
no matter what I do,

11:28.918 --> 11:31.515
are you going to allow me to go
backstage after the performance.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.917
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:32.918 --> 11:33.917
Promise me.

11:33.918 --> 11:34.917
I promise.

11:34.918 --> 11:36.917
No, promise properly.

11:36.918 --> 11:38.118
Do like this.

11:38.918 --> 11:40.118
Okay.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.917
- Good.
- Great.

11:43.918 --> 11:45.917
- Promise.
- Promise.

11:45.918 --> 11:46.917
Okay, cool, so I'll e-mail you.

11:46.918 --> 11:48.153
All right, thanks so much for coming.

11:48.154 --> 11:49.917
- I really appreciate it.
- Hey, sorry to interrupt.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.917
- Oh, hey.
- That was awesome.

11:51.918 --> 11:53.917
Sorry if I stink.

11:53.918 --> 11:55.437
You don't stink, you smell like work.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.398
Congratulations. You
guys were fucking great.

11:57.670 --> 11:59.917
Yeah, I'd never read Moby Dick, but...

11:59.918 --> 12:01.917
I feel pretty confident

12:01.918 --> 12:03.917
I could bullshit my way through
that dinner party now.

12:03.918 --> 12:04.917
I saw Hailey leave.

12:04.918 --> 12:07.118
Yeah, she had a work emergency.

12:07.918 --> 12:08.917
Do you have your lip stuff?

12:08.918 --> 12:10.917
Mmm.

12:10.918 --> 12:11.917
I'm gonna be honest, I don't
give a shit about movement,

12:11.918 --> 12:13.917
but, no, that inspired me.

12:13.918 --> 12:15.917
Inspired you to do what?

12:15.918 --> 12:18.118
I don't know, get my ass in shape?

12:24.918 --> 12:26.917
Nice place.

12:26.918 --> 12:27.917
It's home.

12:27.918 --> 12:30.118
I did what I could with it.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.917
My sister's kids.

12:34.918 --> 12:36.917
They were bastards when they were young.

12:36.918 --> 12:38.917
Here, check this out.

12:38.918 --> 12:41.917
These are my babies.

12:41.918 --> 12:45.917
Betty, this is incredible.

12:45.918 --> 12:47.917
If not maniacal.

12:47.918 --> 12:50.917
Some early Zeppelin.

12:50.918 --> 12:51.917
Oh, the first Black Sabbath.

12:51.918 --> 12:53.917
That is some witchy shit.

12:53.918 --> 12:57.118
I also have an extensive
collection of prog rock.

12:57.918 --> 13:00.703
What, you think I only
get it up for Brahms?

13:01.918 --> 13:03.917
Wow.

13:03.918 --> 13:05.917
After all these years,

13:05.918 --> 13:08.118
I didn't know how cool you are.

13:10.918 --> 13:13.118
Cheers.

13:22.918 --> 13:25.118
You smoke?

13:25.918 --> 13:26.917
[chuckles]

13:26.918 --> 13:29.118
Hit me.

13:48.918 --> 13:51.917
Ah.

13:51.918 --> 13:52.917
My one regret.

13:52.918 --> 13:57.118
He was as brilliant as he was handsome.

13:57.128 --> 14:01.118
Dare I ask what's going
on with you and Thomas?

14:04.918 --> 14:07.118
I'm not sure I even know.

14:09.918 --> 14:11.917
I mean, he's gone.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.118
What does it matter, really?

14:14.918 --> 14:17.917
Didn't ever commit, anyway.

14:17.918 --> 14:19.917
He's not in a position to,

14:19.918 --> 14:22.118
not with his wife and his public persona.

14:22.918 --> 14:26.917
You know, growing old is horseshit.

14:26.918 --> 14:28.917
But growing old alone,

14:28.918 --> 14:32.118
it's the best.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.917
So 40 years with the New York Symphony

14:39.918 --> 14:43.917
doesn't seem like it
turned out so bad for you.

14:43.918 --> 14:46.118
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

14:50.918 --> 14:53.118
[chattering]

14:55.918 --> 15:01.118
Wait, why can't I let you go
backstage after the performance?

15:03.918 --> 15:09.917
Because the performer that
we are watching tonight,

15:09.918 --> 15:12.917
she's my wife.

15:12.918 --> 15:15.118
Oh.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.118
(violin plays)

15:38.918 --> 15:42.118
She's really pretty.

15:42.336 --> 15:44.118
Well, yeah.

16:12.918 --> 16:13.917
[applause]

16:13.918 --> 16:15.917
Shut up!

16:15.918 --> 16:18.917
You shut the fuck up!

16:18.918 --> 16:20.917
She's got a lot of blood.

16:20.918 --> 16:22.118
Yeah.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.917
I had no idea that that
old man and that fish

16:27.918 --> 16:29.226
had the hots for each other like that.

16:29.227 --> 16:31.917
You and Alex have really great chemistry.

16:31.918 --> 16:33.917
Yeah?

16:33.918 --> 16:36.198
I think we just know each
other's bodies really well.

16:37.918 --> 16:39.917
So are these all producer types?

16:39.918 --> 16:43.917
Uh, more like casting directors and agents.

16:43.918 --> 16:44.917
That's cool.

16:44.918 --> 16:46.917
So... You're a tattoo artist?

16:46.918 --> 16:48.917
Yeah, uh-huh.

16:48.918 --> 16:49.917
For a little while now.

16:49.918 --> 16:53.917
My early work is mostly
primitive symbology,

16:53.918 --> 16:55.358
you know, peace signs, anchors.

16:55.918 --> 16:56.917
Yin-yangs, that type of shit.

16:56.918 --> 16:59.917
So you're a bearded guy magnet.

16:59.918 --> 17:02.917
Yeah, it definitely attracts
those I wish to repel.

17:02.918 --> 17:03.917
For sure.

17:03.918 --> 17:06.916
What about you? I mean, a
pretty, smart Julliard dancer.

17:06.917 --> 17:08.916
That's gotta put you on
top of the food chain.

17:08.917 --> 17:09.916
If I ate.

17:09.917 --> 17:10.916
[chuckles]

17:10.917 --> 17:13.117
Uh, no.

17:13.917 --> 17:15.916
Yeah, here and there, I guess.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.085
Nothing serious, though?

17:17.086 --> 17:19.117
Heavens, no.

17:19.917 --> 17:20.916
Heavens, no?

17:20.917 --> 17:22.916
Why not? What about...
What about other dancers?

17:22.917 --> 17:26.916
- Other dancers?
- Yeah.

17:26.917 --> 17:29.917
Okay, excuse me. I've gotta
go press the flesh.

17:29.918 --> 17:30.917
Okay.

17:30.918 --> 17:32.911
Um, bathroom's this way, yeah?

17:32.918 --> 17:36.917
Seriously, your ass and legs are
exactly what I have in mind.

17:36.918 --> 17:38.917
- They're perfect.
- Oh, well, thanks.

17:38.918 --> 17:41.917
So, you'll come to Florida?

17:41.918 --> 17:44.917
I'll put you up in a nice hotel.

17:44.918 --> 17:46.267
Maestro, I can't let you do this.

17:46.268 --> 17:47.917
You made me do the Mexican thumb kiss.

17:47.918 --> 17:49.917
You're not Mexican. You're
not going to go to hell.

17:49.918 --> 17:51.917
- No, Maestro...
- It doesn't matter. It's fine, it's fine.

17:51.918 --> 17:52.917
- Please.
- It's fine. Give me two minutes.

17:52.918 --> 17:54.212
No, I can't give you two minutes.

17:54.213 --> 17:55.917
Give me two minutes. It's
under control, okay?

17:55.918 --> 17:57.917
I have it fine.

17:57.918 --> 17:59.917
Okay, but in two minutes,
I'm going to come in there,

17:59.918 --> 18:00.917
- And I'm going to...
- Shh.

18:00.918 --> 18:03.118
Forcibly remove you.

18:10.918 --> 18:13.917
My message warned you to stay away.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.917
I know.

18:15.918 --> 18:20.118
But I didn't come to see you.

18:20.918 --> 18:24.118
I came to listen to the music.

18:25.918 --> 18:26.917
I couldn't leave without saying

18:26.918 --> 18:29.917
how exquisite your performance was.

18:29.918 --> 18:31.917
Very sophisticated.

18:31.918 --> 18:34.917
Very thoughtful.

18:34.918 --> 18:37.118
You got me thinking.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.917
And your technique with a bow.

18:40.918 --> 18:42.917
Phew...

18:42.918 --> 18:45.917
Even better than I remembered.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.917
It's very nice for one's technique

18:47.918 --> 18:50.917
to practice bowing of a floating ice shelf.

18:50.918 --> 18:54.917
I've been performing in
Greenland, you know?

18:54.918 --> 18:57.917
Yes, Greenland.

18:57.918 --> 19:01.917
As part of my efforts to raise
awareness about climate change.

19:01.918 --> 19:03.917
You got arrested, right?

19:03.918 --> 19:05.118
Yeah.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.917
Three times.

19:06.918 --> 19:08.917
Three times in Greenland.

19:08.918 --> 19:12.917
We succeeded.

19:12.918 --> 19:16.917
Anna Maria...

19:16.918 --> 19:17.917
Nothing changes.

19:17.918 --> 19:21.118
I guess your hair changed.

19:21.918 --> 19:23.917
That's very funny.

19:23.918 --> 19:26.118
But it's just hair.

19:27.918 --> 19:31.118
I guess I'll be leaving now.

19:33.918 --> 19:37.118
All right, going in.

19:37.918 --> 19:38.917
Maestro, the car is...

19:38.918 --> 19:39.917
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

19:39.918 --> 19:42.917
Hey, Hailey!

19:42.918 --> 19:44.917
Who is she?

19:44.918 --> 19:46.917
Uh, me? I'm with the Maestro.

19:46.918 --> 19:48.917
I mean, like, I work with him...

19:48.918 --> 19:49.917
- No.
- Below him.

19:49.918 --> 19:51.917
Underneath... Underneath him.

19:51.918 --> 19:52.917
- You kissed her?
- What?

19:52.918 --> 19:54.917
- No!
- No, no, no.

19:54.918 --> 19:55.917
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:55.918 --> 19:56.917
No, she plays the oboe. No.

19:56.918 --> 19:58.917
She's my assistant.

19:58.918 --> 20:01.917
Then maybe I am seeing into the future.

20:01.918 --> 20:04.917
Anna Maria, look into my eyes.

20:04.918 --> 20:05.917
Calm down, look into my eyes.

20:05.918 --> 20:07.917
Okay, no, no, no. Breath in.
Breathe in a little bit.

20:07.918 --> 20:10.118
[screaming in Spanish]

20:15.918 --> 20:17.917
Oh, my God.

20:17.918 --> 20:20.917
The day you left to conduct for Oslo

20:20.918 --> 20:22.917
you became disloyal,

20:22.918 --> 20:24.917
and faithless.

20:24.918 --> 20:28.118
When you abandoned Mexico,
when you broke with my family,

20:28.918 --> 20:31.917
you abandoned integrity.

20:31.918 --> 20:34.917
For what? Celebrity?

20:34.918 --> 20:36.917
The adoration of cheap little women?

20:36.918 --> 20:37.917
No! No, she...

20:37.918 --> 20:39.917
I told you, she plays the oboe.

20:39.918 --> 20:43.917
Yeah, or maybe for some sickening
pursuit of glory, who knows?

20:43.918 --> 20:44.917
- Glory?
- Yeah.

20:44.918 --> 20:46.917
You think this is about glory?

20:46.918 --> 20:47.917
Yeah.

20:47.918 --> 20:48.917
Glory is for football players.

20:48.918 --> 20:51.917
I'm about the magic. I'm
about the magic, okay?

20:51.918 --> 20:52.917
- Yeah?
- Glory? Glory?

20:52.918 --> 20:54.917
- I'm leaving.
- [speaks Spanish]

20:54.918 --> 20:55.917
- I'm leaving.
- Baby, baby.

20:55.918 --> 20:57.118
Que, Que, Que?

20:57.918 --> 21:01.917
Just don't tell me I'm about
the glory. Come on.

21:01.918 --> 21:02.917
- I'm sorry.
- Aye.

21:02.918 --> 21:04.917
- Oh, baby.
- What?

21:04.918 --> 21:09.917
Let's... Let's not make a
whole drama out of it.

21:09.918 --> 21:10.917
No, don't make a drama.

21:10.918 --> 21:11.917
We're adults now, okay?

21:11.918 --> 21:13.917
Yeah. Of course.

21:13.918 --> 21:16.118
Please, baby, I have one question.

21:16.918 --> 21:17.917
When you go to sleep,

21:17.918 --> 21:20.917
in your luxury apartment late at night,

21:20.918 --> 21:24.917
your noise machine is drowning out
all the sounds of the city below.

21:24.918 --> 21:26.917
- Yeah?
- How do you feel then?

21:26.918 --> 21:30.917
I see what you're trying to say, yeah.

21:30.918 --> 21:32.398
Does it bring your ego pleasure,

21:32.918 --> 21:34.917
making dead music in your sterilized world?

21:34.918 --> 21:38.917
Remarkable only for its lifeless artifice?

21:38.918 --> 21:40.917
Don't say those things.

21:40.918 --> 21:43.244
How do you feel then, mi Amor?

21:43.918 --> 21:45.917
I see what you're saying. Ow.

21:45.918 --> 21:49.118
You fucking disgust me.

21:49.294 --> 21:50.917
- I disgust you?
- Yeah.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.917
Fine. Okay, let me go. Let me go.

21:52.918 --> 21:53.917
Let me go. Okay.

21:53.918 --> 21:54.917
You know what? I'm gonna go.

21:54.918 --> 21:56.917
Okay? Okay, yeah.

21:56.918 --> 21:57.917
Because I'm about the magic.

21:57.918 --> 21:58.917
I'm about the magic.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.449
This is going to be TBD, okay?

22:00.450 --> 22:01.917
This is how they say it in this country.

22:01.918 --> 22:02.917
- TBD.
- TBD?

22:02.918 --> 22:04.917
- TBD.
- TBD, TBD.

22:04.918 --> 22:06.118
[screaming in Spanish]

22:06.918 --> 22:08.917
Hailey, [speaks Spanish]

22:08.918 --> 22:10.917
I told you not to let me go in.

22:10.918 --> 22:11.917
Didn't I? Eh?

22:11.918 --> 22:14.118
[speaks Spanish]

22:19.918 --> 22:22.118
[knocking]

22:28.918 --> 22:31.917
Oh, hey, um, sorry it's so late.

22:31.918 --> 22:34.917
Alex texted me and told me
to come over after the show.

22:34.918 --> 22:35.917
But my phone died, and...

22:35.918 --> 22:36.917
Yeah, he's asleep.

22:36.918 --> 22:39.917
Oh, fuck. Of course.

22:39.918 --> 22:41.917
Um, okay, well,

22:41.918 --> 22:42.917
I brought you guys, like,

22:42.918 --> 22:44.917
this really shitty bottle of rosé.

22:44.918 --> 22:47.917
Uh, as a congratulations.

22:47.918 --> 22:49.917
Here, you should keep it.

22:49.918 --> 22:51.917
Why don't you come in and
we'll just wake him up

22:51.918 --> 22:53.917
and we can all drink it together?

22:53.918 --> 22:55.917
Really?

22:55.918 --> 22:58.118
Yeah, sounds like fun.

23:01.918 --> 23:05.118
He's in my bed.

23:08.918 --> 23:10.917
Oh.

23:10.918 --> 23:12.917
He, like, fell asleep on your bed?

23:12.918 --> 23:16.118
Yeah, he fucking does it all the time.

23:16.918 --> 23:20.118
I'm worried he's
narcoleptic, or something.

23:22.918 --> 23:25.917
Uh...

23:25.918 --> 23:27.411
Hey, um...

23:27.918 --> 23:29.917
We don't know each other very well.

23:29.918 --> 23:32.118
Uh, but, do you mind if
I ask you a question?

23:32.420 --> 23:33.917
No, we're not fucking.

23:33.918 --> 23:36.917
I mean, we used to, but, uh...

23:36.918 --> 23:38.917
we kind of realized it was
screwing with our dancing

23:38.918 --> 23:42.917
so we stopped, and that was 5 months ago.

23:42.918 --> 23:44.917
That was your question, right?

23:44.918 --> 23:48.917
Yeah. Well, I wasn't trying to be
that blunt about it, or anything.

23:48.918 --> 23:49.917
But...

23:49.918 --> 23:52.917
Mmm, well, I have a bluntness problem.

23:52.918 --> 23:53.917
So I'm told.

23:53.918 --> 23:56.917
Um, but, absolutely no fuckage

23:56.918 --> 23:58.917
occurring between Alex and I.

23:58.918 --> 24:00.917
Cool. No fuckage.

24:00.918 --> 24:02.917
You know, I'm gonna hit the dusty trail.

24:02.918 --> 24:04.917
I'm, like, super tired.

24:04.918 --> 24:08.917
Why don't you guys just sleep in my bed

24:08.918 --> 24:09.917
and I'll sleep in his?

24:09.918 --> 24:10.917
That's so sweet.

24:10.918 --> 24:12.917
I just got to get up
like, super early, so...

24:12.918 --> 24:15.917
Is this what I said about
us sleeping together?

24:15.918 --> 24:17.917
Because, honestly, it's so, so over,

24:17.918 --> 24:20.917
and the bed thing, I feel like
he just kinda got used to it.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.917
No, my roommate does it all the time.

24:22.918 --> 24:23.917
I totally understand.

24:23.918 --> 24:28.118
You are a fantastic dancer, and
I hope you enjoy the rosé.
