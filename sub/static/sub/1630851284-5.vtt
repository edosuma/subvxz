before the medicine.

10:30.021 --> 10:33.131
Young lady, in this family, we
put clothing back on the hanger

10:33.358 --> 10:35.616
so the salesperson will think
we're classy!

10:35.636 --> 10:37.952
Why are you acting
like such a cranky pants?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.121
Stop talking
to me about clothes!

10:40.215 --> 10:42.807
How's everything going in here?
I brought twelves.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.884
Do we need more twelves in here?

10:45.036 --> 10:49.205
This mall is an assault
on human dignity!

10:49.224 --> 10:52.317
I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!
I hate it! I hate it!

10:52.468 --> 10:55.654

-(Marge groaning)

10:57.232 --> 10:59.157

who helped you today,

10:59.234 --> 11:02.160
remember, I'm Shauna.

11:03.238 --> 11:04.888
They don't respect you

11:04.906 --> 11:07.724
unless you insult them
just a little bit.

11:07.742 --> 11:09.834
-Girls?
-Cops.

11:09.944 --> 11:11.503
-For real.
-Yeah. Def. Yeah.

11:11.654 --> 11:15.173
Oh, look who got a visit
from the pube fairy.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.233
Dude, those aren't pubes.

11:17.326 --> 11:20.512
Yeah-huh.
Everything new is a pube.

11:20.588 --> 11:23.682
So, Simpson, you got your eyes
on any ladies?

11:23.833 --> 11:26.926
Uh, yeah, I'm talking to
a couple dozen honeys right now.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.502
I'm in love with most of 'em,

11:28.522 --> 11:31.581
but right now, I want
to keep my focus on the gym.

11:31.599 --> 11:34.600

11:34.753 --> 11:36.269
Uh, what about our reps?

11:36.421 --> 11:38.012
There's plenty of time
for that...

11:38.031 --> 11:39.756

11:45.096 --> 11:47.664
Working out is awesome!

11:50.101 --> 11:54.045

11:58.034 --> 12:00.777
So, uh, how was the mall?

12:00.795 --> 12:05.131
Apparently, I'm the worst mother
in the world for being nice.

12:05.283 --> 12:08.893
Lisa had a huge tantrum in
front of the cell phone jewelry.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.621
I've asked her a hundred times
what the problem is,

12:11.639 --> 12:13.064
and she won't tell me.

12:13.216 --> 12:14.807
Can you talk to her?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.401
Of course, honey.

12:16.478 --> 12:19.553
Time for me to earn
my "World's Greatest Dad" mug.

12:19.647 --> 12:22.298
You bought that for yourself
in the hospital gift shop

12:22.391 --> 12:24.133
while I was giving birth.

12:24.152 --> 12:27.662
We both left with something
special that day.

12:28.731 --> 12:29.581
(Homer moans softly)

12:29.808 --> 12:30.807
Honey,

12:30.900 --> 12:31.991
if something's bothering you,

12:32.085 --> 12:32.917
you got to let it out.

12:33.144 --> 12:34.660
Like swallowed burps,

12:34.813 --> 12:37.647

at the worst possible...

That is what
you were doing, right?

13:17.947 --> 13:19.188
Yes.

13:19.357 --> 13:21.691
I can't expect you
to understand my problem.

13:25.713 --> 13:28.364
Honey, if you didn't care,

Not human, I say.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.554
Here we are.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.223
When you called for help,
I was hoping you needed someone

13:37.350 --> 13:39.967
to spell-check
your suicide note.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.211
And just so we're clear,

13:54.668 --> 13:57.836
-Uh...
-In our world, that's a "yes."

13:58.063 --> 14:00.413
We heard what your mother said.
Not cool.

14:00.565 --> 14:04.491
We only use "chunky"
to describe jewelry and stew.
