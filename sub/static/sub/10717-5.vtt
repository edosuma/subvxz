00:01.160 --> 00:03.299
-Thursdays.
-Why the hell are you naked?

00:03.330 --> 00:06.367
It's after Labor Day!

00:06.400 --> 00:10.700
WOMAN (announcing):
Archer. All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.010 --> 00:16.343
FX presents The Americans.

00:20.250 --> 00:21.239
Previously on
"the Americans"...

00:21.280 --> 00:22.144
Where are you? What's going on?

00:22.190 --> 00:23.543
Dad and I have to work.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.579
Pastor Tim and Alice --

00:24.620 --> 00:26.383
did they say something?
I...

00:26.420 --> 00:27.648
Are you screwing my wife?

00:27.690 --> 00:29.920
No. God, no. I w--

00:29.960 --> 00:31.552
Don't lie to me!

00:31.590 --> 00:33.558
Have you patched things up
with Stan yet?

00:33.600 --> 00:36.228
We could use a friendly face
at the FBI.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.898
(lowered voice) You wanna find
out who really planted that bug?

00:38.930 --> 00:40.568
Help me track Martha.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.603
I need to hear from you
within the hour because, um,

00:43.640 --> 00:45.608
it will be really helpful
ifI could...

00:45.640 --> 00:48.768
Discuss a few things with you
beforehand.

00:51.980 --> 00:54.949
(vehicles passing)

00:54.980 --> 00:57.289
(horn honks in distance)

00:57.320 --> 01:00.312
**

01:09.470 --> 01:11.290
(sighs)

01:18.140 --> 01:20.631
(cap pops, pills rattling)

01:20.680 --> 01:23.501
(closes cap, bottle clatters)

01:30.420 --> 01:32.081
(swallows)

01:38.860 --> 01:41.954
(door opens,
footsteps approach)

01:42.000 --> 01:43.319
(objects clatter)

01:43.370 --> 01:45.224
(door closes)

01:45.270 --> 01:47.090
(velcro rips)

01:48.940 --> 01:51.829
(wig, pins, and keys clatter)

01:56.780 --> 01:59.214
I am so sorry.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.679
(coat rustling)

02:08.720 --> 02:13.020
Where have you been
for the last two days?

02:13.060 --> 02:15.699
I, um...

02:15.730 --> 02:18.096
I had an emergency.

02:18.130 --> 02:20.769
One of my colleagues,
and,uh".

02:20.800 --> 02:24.201
I had to --
I had to deal with it.

02:26.070 --> 02:27.537
You didn't even check
your machine.

02:27.580 --> 02:31.368
I know. I know.
And I am really sorry.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.583
Well, I had
an emergency, too.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.016
(sips and swallows)

02:42.060 --> 02:44.688
(glass clatters)
(inhales deeply)

02:44.730 --> 02:47.392
Agent Gaad made an announcement
about the counters

02:47.430 --> 02:49.466
on the Xerox machine.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.196
The one where I've been
copying your reports --

02:52.240 --> 02:54.390
well, the numbers are off.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.228
And Agent Aderholt
took me to dinner.

02:58.270 --> 03:00.636
I can't tell if
they're connected,

03:00.680 --> 03:04.468
or if he was just
asking me out.

03:04.510 --> 03:06.444
What did he talk about?

03:08.450 --> 03:11.044
Marriage, divorce,

03:11.090 --> 03:13.957
if I'm dating anyone.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.922
And?

03:17.960 --> 03:19.552
I told him --

03:19.600 --> 03:22.922
a-a married man who's not
gonna leave hIs wrfe.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.222
Just ex-- _
exactly what you said.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.738
Good.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.704
Good.

03:30.970 --> 03:34.098
(voice breaking)
And by the time I got home,

03:34.140 --> 03:39.168
I thought I was having
a heart attack, really.

03:39.210 --> 03:41.940
My chest got tight and...

03:41.980 --> 03:44.289
And I couldn't breathe
and...

03:44.320 --> 03:45.947
And I called my doctor,

03:45.990 --> 03:48.788
and he said I was having
a panic attack.

03:48.820 --> 03:51.459
And he's prescribed me
valium.

03:51.490 --> 03:52.923
Oh, my God, Martha.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.450
(sniffles)

03:54.500 --> 03:56.798
I can't live
like this, Clark.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.464
I need to be able just to --
just reach my husband.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.479
I am -- I am so sorry.

04:08.810 --> 04:11.472
You shouldn't have to...

04:11.510 --> 04:13.444
(exhales)

04:13.480 --> 04:15.311
(inhales deeply)

04:15.350 --> 04:17.716
Look”.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.980
(paper rustles, pen clicks)

04:20.020 --> 04:22.557
(sighs)

04:22.590 --> 04:25.320
(pen scratching)

04:25.360 --> 04:27.089
Memorize this.
(paper rips)

04:29.030 --> 04:31.999
And now you can always
reach me.

04:32.030 --> 04:34.635
But only call
from a pay phone.

04:34.670 --> 04:37.662
A lady will answer, but she'll
get the message to me

04:37.710 --> 04:39.507
anytime, day or night.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.001
I will need that back
tomorrow morning.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.987
Of course. I mean...

04:51.020 --> 04:54.683
Why would I expect
to keep anything?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.492
(door creaks open)

05:01.530 --> 05:03.020
(gasping)

05:04.970 --> 05:06.267
(exhales sharply)

05:06.300 --> 05:08.837
I was --
what's the matter?

05:08.870 --> 05:10.531
(exhales)

05:12.140 --> 05:14.677
I can't sleep.

05:14.710 --> 05:16.598
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.539
Yes. It's -- I'm sorry, I --
you just startled me.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.514
Come on in.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.848
(switch clicks)
(sighs)

05:23.890 --> 05:25.687
Sorry.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.018
(sighs deeply)

05:28.060 --> 05:31.689
I felt so weird with Henry
when we were bowling,

05:31.730 --> 05:35.120
uh, trying to pretend
to act normal

05:35.160 --> 05:36.627
and pretending that
I'm not worried

05:36.670 --> 05:38.524
every time he hangs out
with Mr. Beeman.

05:38.570 --> 05:40.788
I mean, I don't get why
we cancelled the trip

05:40.840 --> 05:44.207
and where you and dad were.
Mr. Beeman asked me about it,

05:44.240 --> 05:45.639
and I had to make up
this whole story

05:45.670 --> 05:48.036
about clients in_ New York --
Walt.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.241
W-what did he ask you?

05:50.280 --> 05:53.317
Where you were
and what happened with Epcot.

05:53.350 --> 05:56.148
It's just weird,
the way you disappear.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.217
And when Pastor Tim asked me
if you hurt people --

05:59.250 --> 06:01.718
Paige. Okay.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.057
Stop.

06:03.090 --> 06:05.149
Where were you all weekend?

06:05.190 --> 06:06.726
I wanna know.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.354
(sighs deeply)

06:12.640 --> 06:15.165
Maybe we should
take a break.

06:15.200 --> 06:20.775
Just so much has been
thrown at you, and...

06:20.810 --> 06:22.778
Maybe it's too much.

06:25.710 --> 06:28.611
You know, we tried...
(inhales deeply)

06:28.650 --> 06:31.039
To tell you
everything, and...

06:34.290 --> 06:35.780
That hasn't
worked out so well.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.287
Wouldn't you agree?

06:39.800 --> 06:43.190
Where were you?

06:43.230 --> 06:47.189
I think it's enough now,
Paige.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.299
This is enough.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.706
(sighs heavily)

06:55.740 --> 06:59.676
**

07:32.520 --> 07:34.875
(Sirens wailing)

08:16.420 --> 08:19.548
(inhales deeply)

08:19.600 --> 08:22.228
(exhales slowly)

08:22.260 --> 08:25.320
(clock ticking)

08:30.610 --> 08:33.238
(sighs) Oleg...

08:36.410 --> 08:38.970
(inhales deeply)

08:39.010 --> 08:42.013
(exhales slowly)

09:46.750 --> 09:50.811
(inhales deeply,
exhales slowly)

10:11.040 --> 10:13.531
(sighs)

10:15.210 --> 10:17.678
Martha says they know
extra copies have been made

10:17.710 --> 10:19.678
at the Xerox machine.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.181
Anybody could've done that.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.188
(telephone continues ringing)

10:26.220 --> 10:29.678
An agent took her out for dinner
Friday night.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.793
Could be coincidence...

10:38.130 --> 10:41.338
Do you have Hans checking to see
if she's being followed?

10:41.370 --> 10:43.668
Off and on.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.361
Maybe we should put him on
full-time.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.041
(nng)

10:50.080 --> 10:51.604
Okay.

10:51.650 --> 10:55.211
Paige said that Stan was
asking about our trip.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.047
Asking how?

10:59.090 --> 11:00.955
He noticed we were gone

11:00.990 --> 11:03.823
and that we cancelled Epcot
last-minute.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.996
Philip, you need to
make up with him.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.571
(door opens,
indistinct conversation)

11:27.920 --> 11:29.319
You're right.

11:29.350 --> 11:31.215
There's something going on
with Martha.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.480
But it may not be
what you think.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.284
She said she's having an affair
with a married guy.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.393
You believe her?

11:42.430 --> 11:44.762
Well, it explains the secrecy,

11:44.800 --> 11:47.564
but it's also a good cover.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.501
You find anything?

11:50.540 --> 11:53.668
No diary,
datebook, photographs.

11:53.710 --> 11:56.338
Just family.

11:56.380 --> 11:59.577
And a Kama Sutra book.

11:59.610 --> 12:02.010
Lot of pages marked, so...

12:02.050 --> 12:06.589
(Exhales) Okay,
there's probably a guy.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.053
And a gun.

12:11.290 --> 12:12.826
Which I knew.

12:18.670 --> 12:21.867
Oh, bigger spoonful.
Don't break it up.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.959
Like...
Ah.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.637
(Chuckles)

12:25.670 --> 12:27.638
You will be
the only white lady

12:27.680 --> 12:29.978
who knows how to make
sundubu jjigae.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.877
(both laugh)

12:32.920 --> 12:35.946
This doesn't have any
hot peppers in it, does it?

12:35.980 --> 12:38.448
Only in your bowl.
Oh, good.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.787
(laughs)

12:39.820 --> 12:42.118
Anyway,
they are on the bridge,

12:42.160 --> 12:44.219
and grandfather -- he say,

12:44.260 --> 12:45.955
"I will ask you a question.

12:45.990 --> 12:49.289
"And when we get to the other
side, "give me your answer.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.969
"I will never ask you again.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.467
Will you marry me?"

12:53.500 --> 12:55.331
Oh, my God.
Mm.

12:55.370 --> 12:59.136
They get to the other side,
and grandmother says,

12:59.170 --> 13:01.331
"NO."
What?!

13:01.380 --> 13:03.177
So he looks at his brother,
who's pulling the rickshaw,

13:03.210 --> 13:06.304
he says, "turn around.
We try again."

13:06.350 --> 13:07.647
(laughs)

13:07.680 --> 13:09.671
(laughs)
And all day long,

13:09.720 --> 13:12.848
he pulls them back and forth
across the bridge.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.755
Until the day she die,

13:14.790 --> 13:16.826
my grandmother says
she never said, "Yes."

13:16.860 --> 13:19.420
(both laugh)

13:19.460 --> 13:21.496
That's the best story.

13:21.530 --> 13:25.261
Mm. (chuckles)
Well, that's my family.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.996
(laughs)

13:28.040 --> 13:31.009
(chuckles)

13:31.040 --> 13:32.598
Mmm.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.176
(utensil clatters)

13:34.210 --> 13:36.371
What about your family?

13:36.410 --> 13:38.947
Oh. I have a small family.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.869
It's just really my brother
and my dad and I.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.889
My mom left
when I was 10, so...

13:44.920 --> 13:46.182
(sips)

13:46.220 --> 13:47.710
My dad...
(sets down glass)

13:47.760 --> 13:51.127
went into this whole depression
for a few years.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.582
He almost lost his job.

13:54.230 --> 13:56.869
Wow, you really know how
to kill a party.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.720
(laughs)

13:58.770 --> 14:00.692

Ronald Reagan:
Ask around today,

15:45.870 --> 15:48.077
especially among
our young people,

15:48.110 --> 15:50.146
and I think you will find
a whole new attitude...
(Door opens, closes)

15:50.180 --> 15:52.000
Towards serving their country.
Hey, guys.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.472
Hey.
Hi, mom.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.249
(Video game beeping)
Hey, mom.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.645
...Than just fair pay,
equipment, and leadership.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.318
You, the American people,

15:58.350 --> 15:59.988
have sent a signal
to these young people

16:00.020 --> 16:01.851
that it is, once again,

16:01.890 --> 16:03.357
an honor to wear the uniform.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.688
(chuckles)

16:05.730 --> 16:07.152
What are you
laughing at?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.656
Just...

16:08.700 --> 16:12.329
His cheeks -- they're so red.

16:12.370 --> 16:15.168
He looks like a clown.
(laughs)

16:15.200 --> 16:16.929
Where have you been?

16:16.970 --> 16:19.666
I was at a friend's.
I lost track of time.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.177
(chuckles)
You have friends?

16:21.210 --> 16:23.098
Uh, yeah, I have friends,
wise ass.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.846
Paige and Dad made
tuna noodle casserole.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.848
Ooh.
There's leftovers.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.678
Where you going, honey?
Upstairs.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.188
Oh, I wanted to try
your casserole.

16:33.220 --> 16:35.450
It's in the fridge.
Come on.
Keep your mother company.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.185
She hasn't seen you
all day.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.199
Henry, five more minutes on that
thing, then bed, all right?

16:40.230 --> 16:41.720
I'm not gonna fall asleep
anyway.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.193
So stare at the ceiling
for eight hours.

16:43.230 --> 16:44.561
Then you can eat breakfast.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.467
Ooh. This looks good.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.058
(dish thuds)
(TV continues indistinctly)

16:49.100 --> 16:50.909
Your mother and I...

16:50.940 --> 16:53.704
(Whispers) Are gonna talk with
Pastor Tim and Alice tonight.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.402
(TV continues indistinctly)
What are you gonna say?

16:56.440 --> 16:58.749
Well, we'll just see
where we are.

16:58.780 --> 17:02.409
And we'll tell you everything
when we get back. Okay?

17:02.450 --> 17:04.042
...In a strategic
and intermediate

17:04.090 --> 17:06.684
nuclear arsenals
of both Sides.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.792
(car doors close,
dog barking in distance)

17:21.800 --> 17:24.268
(door opens)
Oh.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.179
Tim:
(inhales deeply) Hi.

17:29.210 --> 17:31.440
Hi. Hi, Alice.
Hello.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.742
Hello again.
Tim: Hi.

17:32.780 --> 17:34.418
Hi, Tim. Hi, Alice.
Hi.

17:34.450 --> 17:38.113
Hi. This is our friend,
Father Rivas.

17:38.150 --> 17:41.085
He works with us
in El Salvador.

17:41.120 --> 17:44.624
I am like you, a priest,

17:44.660 --> 17:46.423
but a Jesuit.
Oh.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.758
We welcome
all denominations here.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.267
Especially Jesuits.
(Laughter)

17:50.300 --> 17:52.188
Tim. My wife, Alice.

17:52.230 --> 17:55.267
It is good to meet you both.
Thank you for seeing me.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.633
Oh, of course.
Please. Sit.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.774
Thank you.
Yeah.

18:00.810 --> 18:03.278
Philip: Mm.

18:03.310 --> 18:05.471
(door closes)

18:07.420 --> 18:10.218
We wanted you to meet
Father Rivas

18:10.250 --> 18:12.445
so you could understand...

18:12.490 --> 18:14.481
We're. . .concerned

18:14.520 --> 18:17.728
that you have the wrong picture
about what we do, and --

18:17.760 --> 18:20.820
And when they tell me
a priest in America

18:20.860 --> 18:24.728
wants to know what they do,
I say you must bring me to him.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.795
I must speak to him.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.661
He will understand me.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.509
We're very involved with

18:30.540 --> 18:33.407
the human rights situation
in El Salvador.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.342
We developed a contact
in the government here

18:37.380 --> 18:39.348
who shares our concerns.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.917
This contact let us know
about something

18:41.950 --> 18:44.487
that was about to take place
over there.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.909
They gave me a warning.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.986
We left the mission
in the middle of the night,

18:49.020 --> 18:50.749
my entire church.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.519
Later, we heard
the death squads came.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.993
My God.

18:54.030 --> 18:56.328
Their work saved us all.

18:56.360 --> 19:00.694
We're not saying our government
doesn't do bad things.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.164
Do people get hurt? Probably.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.201
But not because of us.

19:06.240 --> 19:10.700
You know scar Romero
and Rutilio Grande?

19:10.750 --> 19:13.674
Of course. That was terrible.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.712
They were my mentors.
My friends.

19:16.750 --> 19:21.210
Your country pays
for the death squads.

19:21.260 --> 19:25.185
We know.
We work with C.I.S.P.E.S.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.720
They are good.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.296
(inhales deeply)

19:28.330 --> 19:31.868
But these people --
they protect us.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.095
Without them,
I would not be here.

19:35.940 --> 19:39.933
**

19:48.950 --> 19:50.542
(engine idling)
Elizabeth: Thank you again.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.753
Father Rivas: Of course.
Good luck to you both.

19:59.760 --> 20:03.423
You think that guy's
really a priest?

20:03.470 --> 20:05.290
I don't know.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.805
What happened?

20:14.110 --> 20:16.032
Is Henry asleep?

20:17.710 --> 20:19.268
Well...
(Door closes)

20:19.310 --> 20:22.438
We had a really good talk
with Pastor Tim and Alice.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.280
We, uh, we told them about
some of the good things

20:26.320 --> 20:29.187
that we're doing around
the world -- specific things.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.757
How we help people,
not hurt them.

20:31.790 --> 20:35.624
And, um, and hopefully,
he gets that now.

20:37.830 --> 20:41.197
So...everything's okay?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.992
(Sighs deeply)

20:45.310 --> 20:48.632
Paige, he needs to feel

20:48.680 --> 20:51.478
like you still trust him.

20:55.020 --> 20:59.184
It's important
that you make up with him.

21:04.330 --> 21:07.629
Right.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.993
I'm...I'm gonna go to bed.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.593
He -- he really cares
about you, Paige.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.974
(sighs)

21:24.010 --> 21:26.205
Is this gonna work?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.744
(telephone rings, indistinct
conversations in Russian)

21:32.790 --> 21:35.111
(door closes,

22:12.890 --> 22:16.326

Hello?
Yes, hello.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.537
Uh. Your grocery delivery --
it's on its way.

25:07.570 --> 25:09.128
It'll be there in five minutes.

Hi.

27:14.030 --> 27:16.999
(sighs and sniffles)

27:17.030 --> 27:19.066
Clark?

27:27.540 --> 27:30.532
(Birds chirping)

(inhales and exhales deeply)

28:06.750 --> 28:09.344
(sighs)

28:18.930 --> 28:21.455
I'm supposed to tell you
I forgive you.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.427
Do you?

28:26.600 --> 28:28.636
That's what
they want me to say.

28:29.970 --> 28:32.507
Why do you think your parents
would want that?

28:32.540 --> 28:35.100
Apparently, they like you.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.973
They said you're a good guy.
We're on the same side.

28:39.450 --> 28:41.111
Well, what do you think?

28:43.280 --> 28:45.919
I don't know.

28:45.950 --> 28:50.785
I'm finding this all...
confusing.

28:51.990 --> 28:53.799
How so?

28:56.130 --> 29:00.089
I feel like there's this whole
grown-up conspiracy.

29:00.130 --> 29:02.030
You're all so sure about

29:02.070 --> 29:03.867
what I'm supposed to feel
and what I'm supposed to do,

29:03.910 --> 29:06.799
but then you just...
do whatever you want.

29:08.910 --> 29:10.946
Well, that must feel awful.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.642
It does.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.379
(inhales sharply)

29:16.420 --> 29:18.809
Do you feel any clearer
about your parents

29:18.850 --> 29:20.738
than when you first
came to me?

29:23.090 --> 29:26.878
I know they believe
in something.

29:26.930 --> 29:29.819
And they love me.

29:29.860 --> 29:32.499
(sighs)

29:32.530 --> 29:34.760
And they told me the truth
when I asked.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.009
Which maybe was a mistake.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.808
I really think I've seen
that car before.

29:45.850 --> 29:48.068
Think or know?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.940
I-I think.

29:51.190 --> 29:55.718
Green LTD.
License ended 0-4.

29:57.620 --> 30:00.487
Any other cars
you recognize?

30:00.530 --> 30:03.090
I...I'm not sure.

30:03.130 --> 30:05.098
I was focused
on getting the license.

30:05.130 --> 30:06.495
I might've missed
something.

30:06.530 --> 30:08.430
Did someone block you?

30:08.470 --> 30:11.667
You mean on purpose?
Yeah.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.429
I don't know.
It happened so fast.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.277
There were other cars.
I was a block away.

30:16.310 --> 30:18.346
I-I caught it, but then
it was turning the corner --

30:18.380 --> 30:20.177
It's okay.
It's okay. It's hard.

30:20.210 --> 30:23.919
I-I just -- I just need
the information.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.551
Once you made the call,

30:29.590 --> 30:32.058
did you come to the apartment
to see if they were there?

30:32.090 --> 30:35.127
No. If they'd seen me
and then I showed up,

30:35.160 --> 30:38.527
that would've
been bad, right?

30:38.570 --> 30:41.562
**

30:55.950 --> 30:57.542
Woman: Mr. Dunlap
is at an appointment
out of the ofﬁce.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.548
Man: I know he's in there.
(telephone rings)

30:59.590 --> 31:01.148

is why you're protecting him.

VVhatsittake?

31:02.920 --> 31:04.888

Hello?

31:06.790 --> 31:08.826
Hello.

31:08.860 --> 31:10.418
This is Martha.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.759
Hello, Martha.
Clark told me you might call.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.394
He's sorry he wasn't there,
but he wants to talk to you.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.759
(washing machines whirring)

31:17.800 --> 31:19.267
Is he there?

31:19.310 --> 31:22.507
No. Are you calling
from a pay phone?

31:22.540 --> 31:24.679
Yes.
Give me the number.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.076
He can call you there
in one hour.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.771
Can you be there?

31:28.820 --> 31:30.674
Uh, yeah.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.278
Tell me the number.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.958
Um...

31:33.990 --> 31:35.787
5-2-1...

31:40.390 --> 31:44.292
(coughing)

31:46.330 --> 31:48.059
(inhales deeply)

31:51.570 --> 31:53.765
Hans thinks he saw
surveillance on Martha.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.471
Thinks?

31:55.510 --> 31:58.604
Well, he's pretty sure
he saw a car he knew, yeah.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.606
She may be blown.

32:00.650 --> 32:03.369
Well, if they're suspicious,

32:03.420 --> 32:05.479
they still
have a better story.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.387
The bug was Gene.

32:08.420 --> 32:12.789
Copies are unaccounted for
on the Xerox machine she uses.

32:12.830 --> 32:14.559
She can't be the only one.
It's true.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.194
It could be a clerical error.
It's not.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.139
It's also very possible

32:21.170 --> 32:23.468
that they are surveilling
all the other people right now.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.503
She may not be blown.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.178
What if you're wrong?

32:28.210 --> 32:29.632
(sighs)

32:29.680 --> 32:32.240
We will do everything we can
to protect her.

32:32.280 --> 32:36.979
These surveillance reports
are very important to us.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.989
Can you give her a camera?

32:40.020 --> 32:41.988
I'm not sending her in there
with a camera.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.659
What about memorizing dates?

32:44.690 --> 32:46.829
All we need are the dates
that they're on William.

32:46.860 --> 32:49.522
No.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.699
If she's blown, the next
operational act she does,

32:51.730 --> 32:53.994
they are putting handcuffs
on her.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.530
It's very hard.
I understand.

32:55.570 --> 32:57.834
It's excruciating
not to make a move

32:57.870 --> 33:00.998
when things are uncertain.
We are people of action.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.099
That's a good thing, isn't it?
Yes, of course.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.347
You two still care
about people.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.940
It's what makes you
such good officers.

33:07.980 --> 33:10.778
And we will do our very best
to protect your agents.

33:10.820 --> 33:13.516
But if we slow down here,
just a little,

33:13.550 --> 33:17.179
and see if The Centre
picks up anything...

33:17.220 --> 33:19.450
When do we_see William
again?

33:19.490 --> 33:21.856
What makes you think he's gonna
see us after what happened?

33:21.900 --> 33:24.198
I've known _William
a long time.

33:24.230 --> 33:26.369
He complains a lot.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.062
He's volatile,
but he's a patriot.

33:29.100 --> 33:32.035
Just remind him

33:32.070 --> 33:34.402
that he has been here
for 25 years

33:34.440 --> 33:38.206
having accomplished
virtually nothing.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.811
Now he has the chance
to get something

33:41.850 --> 33:44.387
that may very well
tip the balance of power

33:44.420 --> 33:46.217
if there is a war.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.549
He does that,
and we bring him home a hero.

33:49.590 --> 33:52.229
(coughing)

33:52.260 --> 33:54.251
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.928
(coughs) Now...

33:59.530 --> 34:02.931
What about the pastor
and his wife?

34:04.270 --> 34:06.363
We're working on it.

34:08.140 --> 34:10.973
(horn honks in distance,
vehicles passing)

34:16.320 --> 34:17.878
(horn honks in distance)

34:22.960 --> 34:24.427
(exhales)

34:24.460 --> 34:26.428
(sighs heavily)

34:26.460 --> 34:29.759
Nina's dead.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.462
They executed her
a few days ago.

34:36.470 --> 34:39.633
But I-I thought...
No. Doesn't matter
what you think.

34:39.670 --> 34:42.138
Doesn't matter what
anyone thinks.

34:45.010 --> 34:47.308
(exhales slowly)

34:54.590 --> 34:56.854
(exhales slowly)

35:02.030 --> 35:05.488
When I joined
counterintelligence,

35:05.530 --> 35:08.795
they... (swallows)

35:08.840 --> 35:12.469
said this could happen.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.705
Losing someone.

35:18.510 --> 35:21.308
But...

35:21.350 --> 35:23.671
But Nina.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.179
When my...

35:35.200 --> 35:37.555
When my father
was young...

35:40.370 --> 35:42.497
...they fought the Nazis.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.361
They were heroes.

35:47.370 --> 35:50.009
Now my brother's killed,

35:50.040 --> 35:52.349
and they can't even say
the name of the war

35:52.380 --> 35:54.712
he died in at his funeral.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.958
(washing machines whirring)

36:10.000 --> 36:13.720
(telephone rings)

36:16.240 --> 36:17.537
Hello?

36:17.570 --> 36:19.538
It's me.

36:19.570 --> 36:21.128
(sighs)

36:21.170 --> 36:22.569
I've been waiting.

36:22.610 --> 36:24.976
I know. I'm sorry.
There's a lot going on.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.409
Is everything all right?

36:26.450 --> 36:29.146
Yeah. Are -- are you okay?

36:29.180 --> 36:31.489
No.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.340
Can you come tomorrow night?

36:34.760 --> 36:37.911
I-I-I think we should
stick to Tuesday.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.224
(voice breaks) Well,
then you've got to be there.

36:40.260 --> 36:42.626
I-I will. I will.

36:45.930 --> 36:48.194
I love you.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.501
Tell me Tuesday.

36:52.540 --> 36:55.407
(receiver clatters)

36:55.440 --> 36:58.238
(sighs)
(receiver clatters)

36:58.280 --> 36:59.941
(coins drop through machine)

37:08.620 --> 37:11.623
**

37:27.810 --> 37:29.801
He was nice.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.377
And you're right.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.139
He cares about me.

37:37.180 --> 37:39.182
Good.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.248
Hey.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.645
(door closes)

38:07.680 --> 38:09.978
Your, uh, mom doesn't want
to come in?

38:10.020 --> 38:11.988
Uh, no. She's, uh,
seeing a friend.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.908
Henry: Hey, Matthew!

38:13.950 --> 38:16.259
(video game beeps)

38:16.290 --> 38:17.848
Welcome back.

38:17.890 --> 38:20.529
"Max Dugan Returns" is playing
at the K-B tonight.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.154
Your dad has to go to
work later, but do you wanna go?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.861
It just came up today.
Sorry.

38:24.900 --> 38:28.028
But I could take you boys for an
early pizza before I go.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.538
Mario's.
No way. Abdullah's.

38:30.570 --> 38:32.333
Are you high, Mr. Beeman?

38:32.370 --> 38:33.769
(exhales)
I don't think so.

38:33.810 --> 38:36.677
_ The crust at Mario's
is so much better, right?

38:36.710 --> 38:39.508
You know, I'm -- I'm actually
not hungry yet,

38:39.550 --> 38:41.518
so...
Okay, then.
So how 'bout the movie?

38:41.550 --> 38:44.212
I don't know. Um...
Yeah,
he just got here, so...

38:44.250 --> 38:47.879
Okay, yeah. So we'll hang out.
Wanna play a game?

38:58.260 --> 39:00.569
(inhales deeply)

39:04.000 --> 39:07.003
(water running)

39:12.950 --> 39:16.408
Henry's at Stan's again.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.974
Seems like he's spending

39:18.020 --> 39:20.318
an awful lot of time there
recently.

39:20.350 --> 39:23.114
I mean, why doesn't he see
his friends?

39:26.930 --> 39:29.490
What happened
to that Doug kid?

39:29.530 --> 39:31.896
He's around. I see him.

39:31.930 --> 39:33.921
Kids grow apart.

39:33.970 --> 39:36.564
I know, but...
Even if he is bored,

39:36.600 --> 39:38.067
I don't understand
what's so fun over there,

39:38.100 --> 39:39.658
hanging around
with a grown-up

39:39.710 --> 39:43.430
instead of finding kids
his own age somewhere.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.199
I feel like we should
be paying rent over there.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.782
(inhales deeply)

39:57.820 --> 40:01.426
When do you see Martha
again?

40:01.460 --> 40:04.429
Tuesday.

40:04.470 --> 40:07.997
We should be able to confirm
by then if she's being followed.

40:16.310 --> 40:20.804
You know, truthfully, Philip,
Gabriel's not wrong.

40:20.850 --> 40:23.318
You got the one bad sign
with Hans.

40:23.350 --> 40:26.239
Maybe that pans out,
maybe it doesn't.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.420
It can move too fast.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.593
Mm-hmm.

40:37.330 --> 40:38.991
I'll get Henry for dinner.

40:39.030 --> 40:41.567
(glass thuds)

40:41.600 --> 40:43.329
(Philip sighs)

40:44.940 --> 40:48.501
(door opens, closes)

40:51.550 --> 40:54.144
Who was Howdy Doody's brother?

40:54.180 --> 40:56.239
Double Doody.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.918
Oh, my God.
How did you know that?

40:57.950 --> 40:59.645
It's a TV show.

40:59.690 --> 41:01.317
You watched "Howdy Doody"?

41:01.350 --> 41:03.750
What, you think I was
an FBI agent when I was 8?

41:03.790 --> 41:06.327
Uh, yeah. Basically.
Yeah.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.759
(doorbell rings)

41:07.790 --> 41:09.496
Hey, careful.
That -- that's hot.

41:09.530 --> 41:11.191
(crunches) Ow.

41:11.230 --> 41:13.027
Yeah, he just said
it was hot.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.765
I don't care. I'm starving.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.064
(crunches)

41:19.410 --> 41:21.605
Philip.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.198
You here for Henry?

41:23.240 --> 41:26.471
Yes. But can I talk
to you for a second?

41:27.880 --> 41:29.871
Sure.

41:33.720 --> 41:36.314
(door closes)
(exhales)

41:40.830 --> 41:43.298
Stan, this is stupid.

41:43.330 --> 41:44.729
I should've told you
about EST

41:44.770 --> 41:47.796
and about
talking with Sandra.

41:47.830 --> 41:50.958
But I-I just...

41:51.000 --> 41:53.036
I think I knew
it might...bug you.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.971
And although nothing weird
happened or ever would,

41:56.010 --> 41:59.707
H was a wimp,
and I'm sorry.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.672
You were an asshole.

42:03.120 --> 42:07.648
Okay. I think "wimp"
would have sufficed.

42:07.690 --> 42:09.988
You know,
in case you hadn't noticed,

42:10.020 --> 42:12.727
I don't have
a ton of friends here.

42:12.760 --> 42:16.389
And the idea that my friend
was talking to my wife...

42:16.430 --> 42:17.988
ex-wife, whatever.

42:18.030 --> 42:19.759
Yeah, I know.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.739
And truthfully, I know
you wouldn't do anything

42:25.770 --> 42:27.704
'cause you're a good guy.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.507
Her, I'm not
so sure about.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.608
(Chuckles)

42:36.780 --> 42:38.714
Hey, did she say anything
about me?

42:40.050 --> 42:43.679
Yeah.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.780
She thought maybe she'd been
too hard on you.

42:49.060 --> 42:51.324
Henry: Dad, is that you?

42:54.470 --> 42:56.097
Here.

42:56.140 --> 42:58.802
"Who was the first non-human
to Win an Oscar"?

42:58.840 --> 43:01.604
Oh! Uh, uh, that's --
that's easy. Lassie.

43:01.640 --> 43:04.279
Uh, Mickey Mouse.
Yes.

43:04.310 --> 43:06.471
Mr._ Beeman's like
a TrIVIal Purswt genius.

43:06.510 --> 43:09.718
How have you been, Matthew?
Good.

43:09.750 --> 43:11.445
It's good to see you.
You look good.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.641
Thanks.
Hey, dad, can I stay later?

43:13.690 --> 43:15.055
We're eating, and Matthew has

43:15.090 --> 43:16.717
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
on video.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.216
Is that a good thing?
Mm-hmm.

43:18.260 --> 43:20.228
Well, then it's fine by me.
(horn honks)

43:20.260 --> 43:22.728
Oh, that's work. Uh...

43:22.760 --> 43:24.660
I'll be back
in the morning, all right?

43:24.700 --> 43:26.065
Okay.
But don't stay up too late.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.499
You got it.

43:27.530 --> 43:29.464
I'll follow you out.
Good to see you, Matthew.

43:29.500 --> 43:32.139
Uh, you, too, Mr. Jennings.

43:32.170 --> 43:34.468
All right, it's your roll.

Philip Jennings.

You'll never guess
who I just met.

44:40.840 --> 44:43.070
I saw.

You know, that's the guy
I fought with Gaad

when I lost
the Afghan task force list.

we can for her.
