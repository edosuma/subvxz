WEBVTT

00:14.098 --> 00:16.305
I'm so sorry about last night.

00:16.392 --> 00:22.763
Hey, it's over. Just promise to never
scare me like that again, okay?

00:22.857 --> 00:28.147
You forgive me? For everything?

00:35.494 --> 00:37.234
Of course I do, lover.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.821
Ahhh!

00:42.293 --> 00:45.831
Hey. Hey, calm down. You're okay.

00:45.922 --> 00:47.412
God, the last thing I remember is--

00:47.506 --> 00:49.121
Saskia riding you like
a theme park attraction

00:49.217 --> 00:51.833
while draining your chi to death?

00:51.928 --> 00:56.217
At least that's the part I walked
in on. Seemed pretty athletic.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.922
Bo, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean--

00:58.017 --> 01:01.305
Look, she's a succubus. | get it, Dyson.

01:01.395 --> 01:05.138
And I'm sorry. This is my fault.
I should have told you about her.

01:05.233 --> 01:09.647
No, it's not. We need to talk.

01:09.737 --> 01:13.355
Yeah, we do.

01:13.449 --> 01:17.283
We need to talk about happier things,

01:17.370 --> 01:20.112
like my super cool new succubus trick.

01:20.206 --> 01:25.166
Breathing you back to life with my chi.
I mean, how rock star am I?

01:25.253 --> 01:28.336
Who is the best girlfriend ever?

01:28.422 --> 01:31.960
Bo, I'm serious. I need
to tell you something.

01:33.886 --> 01:38.255
Okay. Not loving the sound
of that, but I'm listening.

01:38.349 --> 01:41.887
Saskia isn't who you think she is.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.184
What are you talking about?

01:45.982 --> 01:50.726
And I've been expecting her to
come for you for awhile now.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.560
Why?

01:52.655 --> 01:55.613
Because, Bo, she is your mother.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.323
You're crazy.

02:09.005 --> 02:13.874
The polite term is mentally
unstable. And don't be sexist.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.926
Just because a girl has a little ambition
doesn't mean she's off her rocker.

02:17.013 --> 02:19.129
Even if you are who you say you are,

02:19.223 --> 02:23.557
how could you possibly think that I
would betray my people and join you?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.929
After everything you've done?

02:25.021 --> 02:29.060
Ooh, awkward confession--| don't.
See, you Light Fae honchos,

02:29.150 --> 02:33.359
you're so predictable. I'm
counting on that, actually.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.898
I don't understand.
Why have you come to me?

02:38.993 --> 02:43.111
Ignition. Every fire needs its
spark and you're going to be mine.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.413
Hey, be a friend and just
scooch back a foot or two.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.536
Why?

02:57.470 --> 03:00.337
Oops. New shoes.

03:06.479 --> 03:12.395
One down, boys. Let's go
start ourselves a war.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.322
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.275
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:22.370 --> 03:25.282
My love carries a death sentence.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.489
l was lost for years,

03:27.583 --> 03:30.245
searching, while hiding,

03:30.336 --> 03:34.454
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:34.548 --> 03:39.463
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:47.228 --> 03:52.143
Oh, Sven, you romantic
pirate bastard, you.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.519
[door slamming]

03:54.610 --> 03:57.977
Bo! Just wait! Would you
just please talk to me?

03:58.072 --> 04:02.281
No, no. Allow me to leave. I
will give you guys your privacy.

04:02.368 --> 04:05.155
How long have you
known who my mother is?

04:05.246 --> 04:08.579
Or I could stay. Staying is good.
Quiet like a bunny.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.624
How long, Dyson?

04:11.710 --> 04:15.373
Since before we met. I wanted to tell
you. I wanted to tell you everything.

04:15.464 --> 04:19.548
That's why I called you last night,
because I was going to tell you.

04:19.635 --> 04:24.254
Bo, it wasn't my story
to tell. lt's Trick's.

04:24.348 --> 04:28.387
What does Trick have
to do with my mother?

04:28.477 --> 04:31.890
I let your mother down
long before you were born.

04:31.981 --> 04:34.222
I failed her.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.102
Tell me.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.653
All of it.

04:41.740 --> 04:46.279
She was of my clan. The Fae were
constantly at war back then.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.531
We'd nearly fought
ourselves into extinction.

04:48.622 --> 04:53.537
|'d grown weary of trying to earn
a true peace. So, I forced one.

04:55.713 --> 05:00.332
Trick is a blood Sage. What he writes
in his own blood comes to pass.

05:00.426 --> 05:03.213
It's a nifty little skill there, Trickster.

05:03.304 --> 05:07.764
Not really. Nothing that powerful
comes without a price, as I've learned.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.216
So, what went wrong?

05:10.311 --> 05:13.644
Aife. Peace demands forgiveness.

05:13.731 --> 05:16.973
And in every war, there are those
who find it too dear a price.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.853
Your mother led a small rebellion.

05:18.944 --> 05:23.278
She killed one of the Dark Fae
clan leaders. She was caught.

05:23.365 --> 05:27.529
But she escaped. She came to me.
I could have sheltered her,

05:27.620 --> 05:30.236
but that would have re-started the war.

05:30.331 --> 05:33.619
So, I handed her over to
the Dark for execution.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.665
[AlFE crying]

05:42.635 --> 05:45.217
Well, then they need to go
back to executioner school

05:45.304 --> 05:47.920
because they totally didn't kill her.

05:48.015 --> 05:53.555
No. Gods forgive them. But it was
a long time before I found that out.

05:53.646 --> 05:57.434
She has hated and plotted
against Trick ever since.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.981
Are you telling me everything?

06:03.072 --> 06:04.687
Yes.

06:04.782 --> 06:07.114
Well, then this doesn't
really make sense, does it?

06:07.201 --> 06:12.867
Befriending me and attacking
Dyson. This is obviously personal.

06:12.957 --> 06:14.322
So, what does she want with me?

06:14.416 --> 06:15.576
--I don't know.
--And why now?

06:15.668 --> 06:19.661
I don't know, Bo. And I
don't care to find out.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.996
What matters is getting you
the hell away from her.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.251
Amen.

06:23.342 --> 06:26.675
I've prepared for this. We can get
her out of town if we act quickly.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.298
No.

06:28.389 --> 06:32.507
Now is not the time to be stubborn.
Please, you need to listen to me.

06:32.601 --> 06:36.093
You two still haven't learned
anything from this, have you?

06:36.188 --> 06:39.305
You think that you get to
decide what I do next?

06:39.400 --> 06:42.267
I just found my mother and
you want me to, what, run?

06:42.361 --> 06:44.101
Bo, you saw what she did to me.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.734
Yeah, I did.

06:47.825 --> 06:51.784
And now I heard what was done to her.

06:51.870 --> 06:57.081
Look, I am not saying that I trust her.
Or that she's Fae of the freaking year.

06:57.167 --> 07:01.831
But she is my mother and
I want to hear her side.

07:01.922 --> 07:07.212
Good or bad, whatever
answers she has, I need them.

07:10.347 --> 07:15.933
I am ready to know who
or what I really am.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.181
Whatever the cost.

07:35.456 --> 07:39.495
[KENZI] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow your roll, okay?

07:39.585 --> 07:41.166
I just need... I just
need a little wee recap

07:41.253 --> 07:44.086
just to make sure I got
everything right, okay?

07:44.173 --> 07:48.132
Saskia is really Aife.
Aife is really your mother.

07:48.218 --> 07:55.056
And last night, Dyson really,
really banged your mom.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.805
Well, I think, technically, she banged
him. But yeah, that's the basic gist.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.353
You hear that sound? That is
the sound of my head exploding.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.021
How are you so calm?

08:03.108 --> 08:08.228
Umm, shock. Plus I can't afford to
freak out right now. I have to think.

08:08.322 --> 08:12.361
I mean, clearly I can't trust my friends
anymore, so I'm kind of on my own here.

08:12.451 --> 08:18.447
I know. I can't believe Dyson played us.
My bullshit detector totally failed.

08:18.540 --> 08:23.625
But hey, you know I had nothing to
do with this, right? We are good?

08:23.712 --> 08:28.627
Kenzi, we are always good. I can
always trust you to have my back.

08:28.717 --> 08:33.882
So, hey! Big news in the world of you.
You have met your mama.

08:33.972 --> 08:37.840
--Yeah.
--How the hell does that feel?

08:37.935 --> 08:41.553
Weird. Great.

08:41.647 --> 08:45.014
Scary. I mean,

08:45.109 --> 08:48.943
I know she's kind of a big,
crazy bitch, but still,

08:49.029 --> 08:52.066
she's my mom and she's alive.

08:52.157 --> 08:55.194
This is good. I mean, I've been
letting everybody else interfere,

08:55.285 --> 08:56.661
and now I get to call the shots.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.736
If you want to find Aife, I'm in.

08:58.831 --> 09:01.413
Find her how? I mean, when she
was Saskia, she always found me.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.618
Well hey, look, we do this for people
all the time, find missing Fae.

09:05.713 --> 09:10.548
If Aife was just a case,
where would we start?

09:10.634 --> 09:12.215
With Lauren.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.883
--Why Lauren?
--Because,

09:13.971 --> 09:16.428
if Trick is right and Aife has
something planned for me,

09:16.515 --> 09:18.847
I need to know how to defend myself.

09:18.934 --> 09:23.678
And besides him, Lauren knows
more Fae lore than anybody.

09:23.772 --> 09:28.232
Yes, that is my girl. Cynical and
protective. I am so proud of you.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.525
Really, it's like my little
baby's all grown up.

09:30.612 --> 09:35.106
I still don't know why you've judged
yourself so harshly all these years.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.577
I have my reasons.

09:37.661 --> 09:42.621
You did what you had to do, as a king.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.494
What's done is done.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.748
I know you won't believe
me now, but it is a relief

09:48.839 --> 09:51.876
not having any more secrets to carry.

09:51.967 --> 09:56.677
We don't have time for relief.
I meant what I said to Bo.

09:56.764 --> 10:00.097
Aife means her ill in some way.
You've got to convince her of that.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.176
I'm afraid that ship
has sailed, my friend.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.512
I'm not in a position to ask
her any favours right now.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.142
I'm sorry that keeping my
counsel has come between you.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.944
I know you care for Bo.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.365
Which is why I need you
to get through to her.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.239
I know Aife. Bo is no match for her.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.697
Trust me, I know exactly
how strong Aife is.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.629
I'm sorry. I'm just--
I'm in a bit of a rush today.

10:32.716 --> 10:33.956
Who's Captain Dead Guy?

10:34.051 --> 10:35.916
It's a Light Elder, he
was killed last night.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.093
By a succubus?

10:38.180 --> 10:40.762
By something sharp and pointy.

10:40.849 --> 10:44.057
I have to get my report into
the High Elders this afternoon.

10:44.144 --> 10:48.433
Just standard procedure, but it
is a mountain of paperwork. Go.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.360
--So, you can't help me then?
--I just don't think I understand.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.105
What succubus are you
so afraid of facing?

10:54.196 --> 10:58.064
It doesn't matter. I just need to
learn how to protect myself from her.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.694
How do succubi fight one another?

10:59.785 --> 11:03.152
Slow motion pillow fights?
Crotch lasers?

11:03.247 --> 11:05.329
Bo, you're the only succubus
that I've studied up close.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.825
I suppose I could ask the Ash, but--

11:06.917 --> 11:10.876
No. Can we just keep this between
us for now, until I know more?

11:10.963 --> 11:15.332
All right. I'll see what I can
find out. On one condition.

11:15.425 --> 11:20.419
That afterwards, you and I finally have
that talk and you let me explain myself.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.630
I've missed you.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.215
Okay. Deal.

11:25.310 --> 11:29.098
I have to go... meet a
guy about this thing.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.102
So, can I meet you back at the
clubhouse? Yes? Cool. Okay.

11:35.696 --> 11:40.156
Dude, you have spectacularly
lousy timing, as always.

11:40.242 --> 11:43.450
--What is the emergency?
--Wow. Mama, look at you.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.324
Wow. Your hair. Oh, girl,
look at your hair.

11:46.415 --> 11:50.784
It's nice and streaky and
relaxed and forgiving and--

11:50.878 --> 11:53.335
What the hell's wrong with you?
Are you on something?

11:53.422 --> 11:56.004
You look good. You just
look good. You look real--

11:56.091 --> 11:58.207
Oh, nice. Nice, Brutus.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.964
Oh well, Brutus.
Wow, that's a little harsh.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.591
--Kenzi, wait.
--I don't want to talk to you. Shoo.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.138
Bo isn't returning my calls.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.840
Oh, gee, I wonder why, genius.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.596
You have to make her listen to me.

12:08.687 --> 12:11.599
You know what, man? I don't even
want to listen to you, okay?

12:11.690 --> 12:17.151
Liar, liar, wolf pants on fire. Dammit,
man, we trusted you! I trusted you!

12:17.237 --> 12:20.104
--And you weren't wrong to.
--Bull and shit, buddy.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.779
You've been spying on
her this whole time.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.074
Kenzi, you know I only
want what's best for her.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.697
Well, not anymore I don't, okay.

12:25.787 --> 12:29.996
Why the hell would I ever trust
you around Bo again, huh?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.074
Because I love her.

12:44.014 --> 12:48.929
You make me regret this, I swear
to god, I will sell you for parts.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.143
What do you want me to do?

13:17.047 --> 13:18.833
Surprise!

13:20.550 --> 13:22.336
Cookie?

13:22.427 --> 13:25.134
What's with the Betty Crocker?

13:25.222 --> 13:26.962
Symbolic.

13:27.057 --> 13:31.016
I know I haven't been the best mom,
but it's never too late, right?

13:34.022 --> 13:37.856
You abandon me, stalk me,
nearly kill my boyfriend,

13:37.943 --> 13:40.480
yeah, cookies ought to do it.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.276
It's the boyfriend thing, right?

13:42.364 --> 13:45.982
Which part? The seducing
him or nearly killing him?

13:46.076 --> 13:50.786
I was only trying to make him one
of my thralls to get closer to you.

13:50.872 --> 13:54.410
Besides, he's not good
enough for my little girl.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.493
A mother knows these things.

13:57.587 --> 14:02.957
So, the first time we met, that
obviously wasn't by accident, huh?

14:03.051 --> 14:06.259
Nope. Busted.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.962
Look, I was watching
you for a long time.

14:09.057 --> 14:12.390
I just was trying to find the
right time to introduce myself.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.889
Which you never did.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.768
So, what do I call you
anyway, huh? Saskia?

14:18.859 --> 14:20.690
--Aife?
--Mom has a nice ring to it.

14:20.777 --> 14:24.315
I have a mom. Her name is Mary.

14:24.406 --> 14:27.364
She knits wicked afghans, helped
me with all of my homework,

14:27.451 --> 14:30.943
and never once abandoned me to
figure out my true nature all by myself.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.495
I could knit, you don't know.

14:35.709 --> 14:39.918
Fine. Look, I know I've made
some mistakes. I'm new at this.

14:40.005 --> 14:44.419
But the point isn't that I was gone,
sugarpie, it's that I'm here now.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.251
And I'm not going anywhere.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.927
I have big plans for us.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.803
What did you put in this cookie?

14:57.898 --> 15:03.564
Oh. It's okay, Mama's got you.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.861
The secret ingredient is love.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.153
Bo?

15:15.248 --> 15:20.493
The UN. voted and it is considered
rude to kill the messenger, okay?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.585
Maybe she's upstairs.

15:25.675 --> 15:31.591
Bo? D-Man just wants to talk, please.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.217
Kenzi.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.562
We're too late. Aife's got her.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.891
Are you sure it was Aife?

15:43.985 --> 15:47.694
--Unfortunately, I know her scent.
--Dude, gross.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.397
Well, I can't keep this from
the Council any longer.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.823
What does that mean?

15:51.910 --> 15:55.494
It means this is bigger than us. And Bo.

15:55.580 --> 15:59.289
I was hoping to get Bo out of the
way before I alerted the others.

15:59.376 --> 16:02.618
But the Elders need to know
that Aife has returned.

16:02.712 --> 16:03.462
Where are you going?

16:03.505 --> 16:04.915
To speak with the Ash.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.418
Yeah? And what the hell
are we supposed to do, huh?

16:07.509 --> 16:10.216
Pray. If Aife has Bo in her grasp,

16:10.303 --> 16:13.136
there's no telling what hell
she's putting her through.

16:25.068 --> 16:29.402
M'lady, how may we serve?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.525
Umm.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.153
Is my mom around?

16:40.375 --> 16:42.411
[THRALL] Bahama Mama's up.

16:45.672 --> 16:49.130
[AlFE] There's my baby.
Have a nice rest?

16:49.217 --> 16:52.380
So, this is how you live.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.382
Honey, this is how
everyone should live.

17:01.813 --> 17:05.055
You're still mad. It's the
cookie thing, right? Too far?

17:05.150 --> 17:07.937
Hey, for your information,
I've been looking for you.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.895
I want to talk to you.
I want to get to know you.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.947
You didn't have to treat me like the
enemy, you could have just invited me.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.525
And you would have come? Why?

17:16.620 --> 17:19.532
You're my mom.

17:19.623 --> 17:22.865
I'm so sorry. It's years
of captivity and torture,

17:22.959 --> 17:25.666
they're hell on a girl's social skills.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.210
What are you talking about?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.253
That he was the king
that ended the wars.

17:32.344 --> 17:36.087
And that you broke that peace.
And that he sacrificed you to keep it.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.137
He left out the best part.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.135
What's that?

17:39.226 --> 17:42.184
Oh, just everything that happened
after he handed me over.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.556
The Dark King had a sadistic side

17:44.648 --> 17:48.812
and thought it a waste to execute
a perfectly good succubus.

17:48.902 --> 17:54.113
He decided to keep me instead for
his own entertainment for centuries.

17:54.199 --> 17:58.613
He was a very imaginative man.
We had us a lot of fun.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.159
I'm sorry.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.908
So, I guess you really
do hate Trick, huh?

18:06.002 --> 18:11.122
Hate's like beauty, baby. The real
stuff fades, but it never dies.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.668
You know, maybe this was a
mistake. You're free to go.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.844
I absolutely abhor prisons of all kinds.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.512
I'm not going to keep
my daughter in one.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.214
So, why did you kidnap me?

18:21.309 --> 18:25.803
What can I say? I'm a
sucker for a dramatic gesture.

18:25.897 --> 18:30.812
Also, I thought it would be good
to get away from Trick and his lies.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.860
For US to get a Chance to connect.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.687
I'd like that.

18:41.871 --> 18:45.329
Your timing is impeccable.
The High Council is gathering

18:45.417 --> 18:48.830
in an hour to discuss last
night's slaying of Elder Ellis.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.751
Do you think Aife was involved?

18:50.839 --> 18:53.205
A tad premature, don't you think?

18:53.300 --> 18:56.292
I know all about our people,
including Aife.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.503
And what, she was mythic.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.725
She's very real and she's here now.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.640
Do you believe she means us ill?

19:04.728 --> 19:06.093
I know she does.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.850
And yet you kept this from me
until this last moment. Why?

19:09.941 --> 19:14.355
To discuss Aife meant revealing myself.
Something I was loathe to do.

19:14.446 --> 19:18.485
So, you're saying you put your
personal needs above those of the Fae.

19:18.575 --> 19:19.781
That doesn't sound like you.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.234
I was also trying to protect Bo.

19:22.329 --> 19:26.993
To prevent her from being
caught in the crossfire.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.620
Always knew she was part
of something bigger.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.918
Just had to wait for you to reveal it.

19:32.005 --> 19:35.964
Withholding information critical
to the security of the Fae.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.508
Trick, you've finally overstepped.

19:38.595 --> 19:39.550
What will you do now?

19:39.637 --> 19:41.593
Raise it at the meeting
of the High Elders.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.262
We'll need to discuss your punishment.

19:43.350 --> 19:46.217
I meant about Aife.

19:46.311 --> 19:49.724
Perhaps, you've been
behind that bar too long.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.146
You underestimate us, Trick.

19:52.233 --> 19:56.602
We're no longer the motley crew of
scattered tribes from your day.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.403
If Aife so desires,
then let her come at us.

19:59.491 --> 20:03.109
Surely, we can handle
one bitter succubus.

20:03.203 --> 20:07.116
Or two, if it comes to that.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.508
Okay, seriously,
what's with the beefcake?

20:24.599 --> 20:27.807
Oh, you mean my thralls? I think
they class up the place, don't you?

20:27.894 --> 20:32.103
Well, yeah, but how do you get
them to obey you for so long?

20:32.190 --> 20:35.307
I mean, I can usually only
sway by touch and it wears off.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.643
It's an acquired skill.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.649
Siphoning chi is an art. But once
you've learned to master it,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.605
you can enslave just about anyone.

20:42.700 --> 20:46.739
Also, it does wonders
for the crow's feet.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.037
So, why didn't you use it then?

20:49.124 --> 20:50.864
Enthrall the bastard
who held you prisoner?

20:50.959 --> 20:52.290
Oh nice, blame the victim.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.288
--No, I didn't mean that.
--|'m kidding. I'm kidding.

20:54.379 --> 20:58.463
Fair question, easy answer--he had
an amulet that binds chi to your body.

20:58.550 --> 21:02.008
It's like kryptonite to us succubi.
I couldn't influence him.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.461
Is he my father?

21:04.556 --> 21:05.466
I don't want to talk about that.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.388
--Is he still alive?
--Pretty sure I was speaking English.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.182
Sorry.

21:10.270 --> 21:14.309
All in due time, okay?
Ask me something else.

21:16.568 --> 21:20.186
Why didn't you declare yourself
to me the first time we met?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.692
Honestly, I wanted to
get a feel for you first.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.114
I didn't know if Trick had polluted
you. Turned you against me.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.702
No. He's never said a
bad word about you.

21:26.786 --> 21:31.155
The thing is I've always had
high hopes for my little girl.

21:31.249 --> 21:34.286
You can make a real
difference in this world.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.368
Is this the part where you
tell me to go to college?

21:36.463 --> 21:40.297
This is the part where I tell you
we're going to take down the Fae.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.502
--What?
--I know you hate the divide

21:46.598 --> 21:49.590
as much as I do.
The Dark and the Light.

21:49.684 --> 21:53.802
And we're going to put an end to that,
you and me, starting tonight.

21:53.897 --> 21:57.310
Right. So, what, you, me,
and your himbo army

21:57.400 --> 22:01.268
are going to take down the Fae as
they flee from us and our male models?

22:01.362 --> 22:05.696
Oh, honey. They do more
than just mix Mama drinks.

22:07.785 --> 22:11.152
Yeah? Like what?

22:15.335 --> 22:17.951
Forget Trick, we need
to talk about Aife.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.037
We're fools to ignore the past.

22:20.131 --> 22:23.669
I will not open this to debate.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.422
He's proven we can't trust his word.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.346
What do you want?

22:30.433 --> 22:32.389
Further, how did you get in here?

22:32.477 --> 22:34.559
Package from Aife.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.265
Boom.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.606
--Call it off.
--|t's done.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.734
You can't be serious. That's your plan?

22:47.825 --> 22:49.690
You don't like? I thought
it was rather elegant,

22:49.786 --> 22:51.697
but I'm open to better ideas.
We can go halfsies.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.904
You're talking about assassinations!

22:53.998 --> 22:55.283
Murders, anarchy.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.583
Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.752
I'm suggesting we finish
what Mama started

23:00.838 --> 23:04.422
and cut those power-hungry
gasbags down at the knees.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.841
Look, when we first met, you said
you didn't want to choose sides,

23:06.928 --> 23:08.338
--that you wanted to be free.
--So?

23:08.429 --> 23:10.260
So, why should you be the
only one to have that choice?

23:10.348 --> 23:11.508
--Well, I shouldn't.
--So, you do want to

23:11.599 --> 23:12.759
tear down the establishment?

23:12.850 --> 23:14.681
Yes. But not like this.

23:14.769 --> 23:18.887
How, then? Don't be so
naive. It's the only way.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.017
And then what?

23:20.108 --> 23:22.599
And then we let the world burn.

23:22.694 --> 23:27.563
And you and I reign over
the ashes, side by side.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.860
You don't want to free people.

23:32.954 --> 23:35.240
You just want to be their new religion.

23:35.331 --> 23:38.368
But doesn't that have a nice ring to it?

23:38.459 --> 23:42.919
Trick was right about you.
You are crazy.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.837
Don't be a little cow.
Mommy has feelings.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.039
I don't want any part of this.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.090
That complicates things.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.258
You said I was free to go.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.964
Now consider yourself grounded.

24:01.858 --> 24:08.229
Hey! Let her go. She'll be back.
A girl needs her mama.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.405
More salt next time.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.411
How badly did she hurt you?

24:17.498 --> 24:20.490
Medium. But I'm going to
need more than just healing.

24:20.585 --> 24:21.574
What do you mean?

24:21.669 --> 24:26.129
Aife. I'm going to need to store up
all the energy I can to face her.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.830
Then take it.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.420
Come on, get him in
the lab. Move. Move!

24:34.515 --> 24:35.675
What's his status?

24:35.767 --> 24:36.973
He's crashing.

24:37.060 --> 24:41.269
Shit. All right, come on, hang
in there. Two, three, four, five.

24:44.776 --> 24:48.189
I never meant to hurt you.
Please believe me.

24:49.572 --> 24:55.033
I do. I'm not angry with you, Dyson.
I don't want to fight anymore.

24:55.119 --> 25:00.034
I know that you thought that lying to
me was protecting me, I get that.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.706
I just don't know how to forgive it.

25:02.794 --> 25:05.251
Bo, |--

25:05.338 --> 25:08.751
Don't! Please, don't.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.926
Fine.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.675
But whatever is or
isn't left between us,

25:16.766 --> 25:18.302
I don't want you facing
Aife without me.

25:18.393 --> 25:22.306
I know. But I have enough
to deal with as it is.

25:22.397 --> 25:26.515
And I can't have people on my team
that I don't completely trust.

25:28.903 --> 25:31.189
There's nothing I can say to
make you change your mind?

25:31.280 --> 25:34.317
Dyson .

25:34.409 --> 25:38.573
You have to let me
fight my own battles.

25:38.663 --> 25:43.908
Do that, and when the smoke clears,

25:44.001 --> 25:46.253
we'll see where we stand.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.513
Come on. Let's go see Lauren.

26:05.398 --> 26:06.103
Phone.

26:06.149 --> 26:07.685
Thanks.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.152
[LAUREN] There's a med evac
out the south doors. Move.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.230
Fae-Con One, huh?

26:16.951 --> 26:18.066
Bo, thank god you're okay.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.571
--What the hell is going on?
--There was an attack

26:19.662 --> 26:22.449
on the meeting of the High Elders.
It was a suicide bomber.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.826
The Ash is on life support
and it does not look good.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.327
--Oh shit.
--The rest of the wounded are being

26:26.419 --> 26:28.159
moved to a safe site, as
well as the noble families

26:28.254 --> 26:30.040
until we can just figure out
what the hell is going on.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.246
I know what's going on.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.877
This is about that other
succubus, isn't it?

26:33.968 --> 26:35.674
Bo, you listen to me very carefully.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.299
A hit like this looks like a
declaration of war from the Dark.

26:38.389 --> 26:41.472
And it will not be long
until our side retaliates.

26:41.559 --> 26:44.096
If someone else is involved in this,
we have to stop her now.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.597
You can't afford to
protect her anymore--

26:45.688 --> 26:47.974
--She's my mother.
--What?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.397
Doc! Doc, you got that list?
I need it now.

26:50.485 --> 26:53.898
Yeah. Right here.
Most are expecting you.

26:53.988 --> 26:56.024
Whoa, man, where are you going?
What's with the body armour?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.070
All hell's breaking loose.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.116
I got to lead this evac, get these
important people underground.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.660
Well, you are reasonably
important yourself,

27:02.747 --> 27:04.533
so don't get too heroic on me, okay?

27:04.624 --> 27:06.740
No. I'll play it just like you, all right?

27:06.834 --> 27:09.621
General cowardice, with
moments of crazy bravery.

27:09.712 --> 27:12.419
All right. I can live with that.
One for good luck?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.047
--What?
--What?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.341
I'll be seeing you.

27:17.428 --> 27:18.884
Yeah.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.804
I will either stop her myself
or bring her in, I promise.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.631
I just need one more chance
to get through to her

27:23.726 --> 27:26.263
before you bring the entire damn
Light Fae army down on her.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.184
I don't know, Bo--

27:27.271 --> 27:30.138
Look, you have to trust
me. I have a plan.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.770
She told me about some kind of
amulet that blocks the chi.

27:32.860 --> 27:37.524
Yeah. Yeah. Koushang. I looked
into it after you asked.

27:37.615 --> 27:38.445
Well, where do I find one?

27:38.533 --> 27:42.196
The Light Fae have a trophy room with
things passed down from Ash to Ash.

27:42.286 --> 27:46.154
We keep one in there, inside an
amethyst crystal. Here, take these.

27:46.249 --> 27:47.989
--[BO] What is this?
--[LAUREN] It's a key and a map.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.871
The guards are helping with the
evac, so you have got to hurry.

27:50.962 --> 27:53.704
Thank you. I know the
risk you are taking.

27:53.798 --> 27:57.290
And if I get through this,
I owe you that last talk.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.805
You please just come back safe.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.678
Thank you.

28:11.566 --> 28:13.898
There's an evac order for the Elders.

28:13.985 --> 28:16.021
I know. I'm helping facilitate it.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.727
Shouldn't you be getting
underground, too?

28:17.822 --> 28:19.687
Have you not seen where I live?

28:19.782 --> 28:22.694
You know what I mean.
She's going to be coming for you.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.868
Most likely. I created this mess.

28:25.955 --> 28:31.166
I'm not abandoning my brothers and
sisters by hiding from it. Where's Bo?

28:31.252 --> 28:32.367
She's gone to face Aife.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.168
--Alone?
--She made me promise not to follow.

28:35.256 --> 28:38.168
But I'll be damned if I let her fight
this battle alone for all of us.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.716
Good. What are you planning?
How can I help?

28:40.803 --> 28:44.466
I'm going to go see the Norn.
Ask her to intercede.

28:44.557 --> 28:48.425
You know the Ancients adore trickery.
Their favours come at a high price.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.225
I know the risks.

28:50.313 --> 28:53.305
They're mine to take.

28:53.399 --> 28:57.733
--|'|| arrange an audience.
--No need. We have a history.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.562
You're not the only one with secrets.

29:00.656 --> 29:03.443
I just came to wish you luck.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.445
Thank you, my friend.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.449
[B0] The Koushang should be in here.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.125
[KENZI] Wait! What if it's a booby trap?

29:15.212 --> 29:19.251
Like, payback for rejecting
Lauren's hot-pot lady love, huh?

29:19.342 --> 29:20.798
[BO] Shh!

29:32.438 --> 29:33.803
All clear.

29:33.898 --> 29:37.356
Good. I thought there
would be guard dragons.

29:39.153 --> 29:42.020
What? These people are very
freaky, you never know.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.571
Thanks. Less sassing
and more searching.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.945
All right.

29:47.036 --> 29:49.903
So, what are we going to do when
we face Mommy Dearest, huh?

29:49.997 --> 29:53.239
Other than pee our pants a lot.
Also, I think I might cry.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.825
Look, I just want one more
shot to reason with Aife.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.662
Get her to turn herself in
before the Fae come for blood.

29:58.756 --> 30:01.088
Well, good luck with
that, because I vote

30:01.175 --> 30:04.508
we just knock her head unconscious
and drag her in by her hair.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.131
Well, that works, too.

30:06.222 --> 30:09.555
Ooh, shiny. Well, no offence, babe,

30:09.642 --> 30:12.850
but if Aife scares Trick
and got the drop on Dyson,

30:12.937 --> 30:16.100
I'm thinking she's pretty much,
like, a grade ten succubus.

30:16.190 --> 30:17.270
So, what grade am I?

30:17.358 --> 30:25.276
Oh, you know, kindy-garten with
pigtails and a Muppet lunchbox.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.822
So, why come with me then?

30:26.909 --> 30:31.323
Because I got your back no matter
how stupid, you know that.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.082
Yeah, I do.

30:39.922 --> 30:44.336
Ooh, jack and pot, bitches.

30:44.427 --> 30:48.261
Hey, this Koushang thingama-Fae
looks a lot like this, right?

30:48.347 --> 30:49.723
That's it.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.138
How do we know it works?

30:51.225 --> 30:54.217
You up for a test run? Lock lips
and see if I can drain your chi?

30:54.311 --> 30:56.017
Dude, seriously?

30:56.105 --> 30:58.221
Did you make this whole thing
up just to make out with me?

30:58.315 --> 31:03.981
Yeah. You caught me, Kenzi.
Now hold still, lovah.

31:13.497 --> 31:19.458
Oh, you just got succu-busted! Not
so tough now, little succubus, huh?

31:19.545 --> 31:22.537
Kenzi, I love you.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.964
Which is why I can't let
you risk yourself for me.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.634
Bo! Dammit! Get back here.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.598
Hale, she's gone rogue.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.020
How do you feel about another evac?

31:50.367 --> 31:52.449
Hello?

31:57.041 --> 31:59.248
Mom?

31:59.335 --> 32:02.702
Oh, poo. I was expecting
a sneak attack.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.958
You know, it's usually best
not to announce your arrival

32:05.049 --> 32:07.335
if you want to keep advantage.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.589
Well, I know better than to
underestimate you like that.

32:10.679 --> 32:14.547
Where are your thralls? Or are you
actually ready for a fair fight?

32:14.642 --> 32:15.927
I gave them the night off.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.304
Well, the ones who haven't
blown themselves up yet.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.353
I thought we could use some
privacy. A little girl talk.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.182
I agree.

32:24.276 --> 32:28.440
I came to officially ask
you to stop your attacks.

32:28.531 --> 32:32.649
If you come with me, I will plead
with the Light Fae to go easy on you.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.410
Oh, you're adorable.

32:38.874 --> 32:42.366
Ooh, and armed. That's my girl.

32:42.461 --> 32:47.000
You still rejecting my
beautiful plan? I'm sad.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.877
You'll get over it.

32:51.345 --> 32:53.961
We'll see, shall we?

32:54.056 --> 32:57.219
Go. There will be food and
drink at the next way station.

32:58.519 --> 33:00.680
Trick, she's gone after Aife, alone.

33:00.771 --> 33:04.263
Okay, I can find her if I track her
on her phone, but I need help.

33:04.358 --> 33:06.189
Where's your book, Blood King?

33:06.277 --> 33:08.063
Kenzi, don't.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.769
We both know you can shape destiny.

33:09.864 --> 33:12.071
You've done it before,
so do it now for Bo.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.365
You don't know what you're asking.
This is not a game.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.578
What are you going to do,
help everybody else, just not Bo?

33:16.662 --> 33:19.904
Do you really think I didn't try to
fix this thing with Aife long ago?

33:19.999 --> 33:22.866
I have rooms of books
filled with my blood.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.828
Every time, something horrible went
wrong. I can't use my blood again.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.958
I won't!

33:29.049 --> 33:31.540
Fine. Use mine then.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.921
Kenzi!

33:34.013 --> 33:35.969
Come. Sit.

33:38.684 --> 33:43.144
I can't explain everything.
Just please try and understand.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.221
Understand is that you're a coward.

33:45.316 --> 33:48.808
Bo might die tonight fighting
your battle. Paying for your sins.

33:48.903 --> 33:52.771
And if you really cared for her, there is
nothing you wouldn't do to stop that.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.655
No chance we could hug this out, huh?

34:01.373 --> 34:02.829
Guess not.

34:18.807 --> 34:21.219
I won't let you ruin
everything I've worked for.

34:21.310 --> 34:25.019
I wanted you willing, but I can
make you join me against Trick.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.972
I can make you one of my thralls.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.323
You bitch!

34:38.410 --> 34:41.902
You have to calm down and listen
to me. I don't want to hurt you.

34:41.997 --> 34:46.366
And I didn't want to have
to kill you. Shit changes.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.704
No running in the house!

35:07.189 --> 35:09.305
I'm here to see the Norn.

35:29.461 --> 35:35.752
Oh, you again. So soon.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.834
Actually, it's been a few centuries.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.419
Oh, well.

35:40.514 --> 35:43.256
Time passes differently in here.

35:47.021 --> 35:48.602
My cane.

35:56.530 --> 35:59.863
So...

35:59.950 --> 36:05.490
...what brings you to see me?

36:07.166 --> 36:10.408
The same as everyone else.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.164
I beg a favour.

36:13.255 --> 36:16.622
My favours aren't begged,
they're bought.

36:18.761 --> 36:22.299
You remember my price?

36:22.389 --> 36:24.971
A sacrifice.

36:25.059 --> 36:29.928
You will grant that which I want most
in exchange for what I hold dearest.

36:30.022 --> 36:36.063
Oh. Very well. I am intrigued.

36:37.488 --> 36:42.448
Come, supplicant, kneel.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.241
I will hear your plea.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.996
[AlFE] You're asking for
a spanking, young lady.

37:00.469 --> 37:03.051
Where are you going? Why are you
resisting? You're my daughter.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.720
Because I know there's good in you.

37:21.323 --> 37:23.359
Gods, help me.

37:24.410 --> 37:28.449
[NORN] When last we met,
you wanted my help, as well.

37:28.539 --> 37:30.996
What did I ask for?

37:32.209 --> 37:33.494
My wolf.

37:33.585 --> 37:38.295
That's right. You're very essence,
shifter. Strip you bare.

37:38.382 --> 37:42.045
Leave you as a normal man.
What did you say?

37:42.136 --> 37:44.548
I said it was too high of a price to pay.

37:44.638 --> 37:47.721
Uh huh. Just so.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.008
But I'm ready now.

37:52.813 --> 37:55.850
What's that? Speak up.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.057
I said I'm ready to
pay your price, crone.

37:58.152 --> 37:59.938
You would give up your
wolf for this woman?

38:00.028 --> 38:02.155
Yes.

38:02.239 --> 38:05.026
Why?

38:05.117 --> 38:08.109
Reasons are not part of this bargain.

38:08.203 --> 38:13.118
If you give my strength to Bo,
you can take anything you need.

38:15.002 --> 38:19.871
Oh well, then. A deal is struck.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.832
A sacrifice is named and accepted.

38:22.926 --> 38:27.215
In exchange for my helping this Bo,

38:27.306 --> 38:31.174
I will take from you that
which you value the most.

38:31.268 --> 38:34.226
I will take...

38:34.313 --> 38:36.429
...your love of her!

38:37.858 --> 38:39.394
You will remember
the one you have lost,

38:39.485 --> 38:42.192
but you will never feel
passion for her again.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.235
[roaring]

38:55.209 --> 38:56.198
Hold on. Don't let go.

38:56.293 --> 38:59.285
Now why would I let go
when I can take you with me?

39:03.091 --> 39:04.342
Bo! I got here as fast as I could.

39:04.426 --> 39:05.632
Get out of here, Kenzi.

39:05.719 --> 39:08.461
Bo, shut up, okay. And let
go of your crazy mother.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.671
No. No. I can pull her up.
I'm strong enough.

39:10.766 --> 39:12.051
Yeah, okay well, the banister isn't.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.224
Okay, I can't help you, Bo.
Please, you've got to give up--

39:14.311 --> 39:16.973
I am not giving up on
her like everybody else.

39:44.800 --> 39:49.214
Bo, she's right. Honey,
you've got to let me go.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.259
Don't say that.

39:50.347 --> 39:51.837
There's still so much I need to tell you.

39:51.932 --> 39:52.967
No!

39:53.058 --> 39:55.140
Ask Trick.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.809
He knows it all. Tell him I'm sorry.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.852
And you promise me
one thing, okay, honey?

39:59.940 --> 40:01.396
What?

40:01.483 --> 40:03.769
Try and forgive me.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.839
What the Houdini?

40:27.926 --> 40:30.338
There's no body, no blood trail.

40:30.429 --> 40:33.796
What the hell did she do?
Fly off with a broom?

40:33.890 --> 40:36.927
It wouldn't surprise me.

40:37.019 --> 40:42.730
Come on. Let's not
push our luck. Let's go.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.437
[KENZI] Thanks for another
mind-blowing day, huh?

40:50.532 --> 40:51.738
[BO] You're welcome.

40:51.825 --> 40:56.364
Swamp freaks, headless guys.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.116
People eaters.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.743
You can't say I haven't introduced
you to some interesting people.

41:00.834 --> 41:03.667
No, ma'am. Here.

41:03.754 --> 41:07.793
Pay is shit, it's dangerous as hell,

41:07.883 --> 41:11.341
but life with you,
my dear, is never boring.

41:11.428 --> 41:13.259
Right back at you.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.673
So, can we please talk
about how we feel

41:17.768 --> 41:19.599
vis-a-vis the other
members of our posse now?

41:19.686 --> 41:21.642
Oh, Kenz, I don't know.

41:21.730 --> 41:23.846
Aife said Trick still knows more.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.317
Yeah, which means
he's still lying to me.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.107
Maybe he has his reasons.

41:28.195 --> 41:30.436
[BO] Well, he better.

41:30.530 --> 41:34.273
I mean, the shitty thing is is that I
thought he was one of the good guys.

41:34.368 --> 41:38.907
You know. That he was trying
to protect me from the Fae and

41:38.997 --> 41:41.329
now I don't know what to think.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.247
What about D? You
going to forgive him?

41:43.335 --> 41:48.455
Well, he's a stubborn bastard. I don't
know how, but he helped me tonight.

41:48.548 --> 41:52.632
I could feel him with me
when I was fighting my mom.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.380
So, you guys are good?

41:54.471 --> 41:57.178
[BO] We will be, finally.

41:57.265 --> 41:59.130
There's no more secrets between us.

41:59.226 --> 42:01.512
We deserve a fresh start.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.231
Well, unless your mom goes
succu-cougar on his ass again.

42:12.322 --> 42:16.361
So, you do think she's still alive?

42:16.451 --> 42:20.410
Like a cockroach after the
apocalypse, baby. Evil never dies.

42:20.497 --> 42:25.867
Kenzi, she's different.
You saw her tonight.

42:25.961 --> 42:27.826
She sacrificed herself for me.

42:27.921 --> 42:34.713
And I don't know how or why,
but that was the real Aife.

42:34.803 --> 42:36.634
That was my mom.
