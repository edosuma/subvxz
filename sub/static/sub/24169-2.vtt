00:06.005 --> 00:07.215
[rapid panting]

00:08.008 --> 00:09.175
[panting continues]

00:12.262 --> 00:13.888
[panting continues]

00:16.599 --> 00:17.976
Oh, good. You're awake.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.811
-Honey, are you okay?
-[panting continues]

00:19.894 --> 00:21.938
You're breathing really fast, Mom.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.356
I know.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.649
This is new.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.652
[panting] Well, as you saw yesterday,
I'm a little antsy.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.196
Anyway, I didn't want you to wake up
and find me gone and worry.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.114
[panting]

00:32.073 --> 00:33.283
I gotta go.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.579
Go? Do you think that's a good idea?
I don't.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.206
-Where are you going?
-I don't know, but I gotta get out of here.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.460
Sweetie, we just unchained you
and you're kind of kill-happy right now.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.044
So I'm going to have to insist--

00:45.128 --> 00:47.088
-[door closes]
-Okay, drive safe.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.256
Nice.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.717
-You could've said something.
-I just woke up.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.051
Me, too.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.810
[distant hawk screeches]

01:09.527 --> 01:11.446
[panting]

01:18.620 --> 01:20.455
[panting]

01:20.538 --> 01:21.372
Ha!

01:22.957 --> 01:23.917
[faint squeak]

01:25.168 --> 01:27.045
[panting]

01:30.882 --> 01:31.841
Who's my little friend?

01:32.425 --> 01:35.637
Who's my furry
little cross-training friend? You are.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.598
Let's go again.
I'll give you a head start.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.395
Oh, my God, you can run <i>and </i>poop.
That's so cool.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.981
You were chasing rabbits?

01:47.065 --> 01:49.275
Yeah. I tried jogging,
but I didn't feel any better.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.694
And then this rabbit ran out
in front of me

01:51.778 --> 01:55.824
and I went after it and I was like,
"Yes, this is scratching that itch."

01:55.907 --> 01:57.867
You know what's cool?
I'm never surprised anymore.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.245
Well, I feel like
channeling my bloodlust

02:00.328 --> 02:03.623
is key to preventing something
like last night's oopsie.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.291
There's an eyelid on the light.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.337
Oopsie.

02:12.841 --> 02:13.967
[squishing]

02:14.551 --> 02:15.468
Mmm!

02:15.552 --> 02:19.264
So I took the container with Serbian Guy
back to the storage unit.

02:19.347 --> 02:23.977
And then I destroyed his phone
and then buried his clothes in the desert.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.771
Look at me, I'm becoming a morning person.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.983
If this helps you be less murdery,
that's great.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.944
My concern is, if someone sees you
running around

02:33.027 --> 02:35.572
snatching rabbits
like a coyote in yoga pants,

02:35.655 --> 02:38.074
they might ask questions like,
"What the <i>fuck </i>is that?"

02:38.158 --> 02:39.242
No one's gonna see me.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.078
I'm way out in the desert,
even past where we buried Gary.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.456
I just think you should keep a low profile
until we know what's going on.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.833
Maybe we'll get you a treadmill.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.752
We could put a toy rabbit on a stick
in front of it and you can chase that.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.339
Well, make up your mind, Joel.
Am I a coyote in yoga pants

02:53.423 --> 02:55.383
or a greyhound at a racetrack?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.094
He's thinking, he's thinking.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.555
He knows he screwed up
and he's going with...

03:00.638 --> 03:02.098
You are my beautiful wife.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.226
Nailed it.
Don't come at me with that weak tea.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.978
I love you very much.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.480
What is that supposed to mean?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.065
She's trying to get in your head.
Don't listen to her.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.318
Okay, when I was running,
I had a thought.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.904
I think we should go to the office today
and tell Carl

03:15.987 --> 03:18.615
that we want in on that big
housing development he's doing.

03:18.698 --> 03:23.036
Or even better, we hold off for a while
on seeing our boss who yells at us

03:23.119 --> 03:25.830
and whose vocal cords you might rip out
and eat in front of him.

03:26.831 --> 03:29.334
Come on, Joel. I don't wanna lay low.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.086
I wanna make my mark.
I wanna shake shit up.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.546
Dream big.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.839
My dream right now

03:34.923 --> 03:37.592
is to keep my family together
and my wife out of jail.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.511
And take apart this hammer-knife
I made to kill the undead,

03:40.595 --> 03:43.139
and use the hammer portion
to build bookshelves.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.599
Then, when my workday is done,

03:44.682 --> 03:47.185
the knife to cut Brie
and, perhaps, an apple.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.687
Fine. I'll go see Carl alone.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.148
But if he doesn't let us in
on that project,

03:52.232 --> 03:55.360
I am going to pry it out
of his plump and salty fingers.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.739
Okay, I'll come with you.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.366
[clatters]

04:02.617 --> 04:05.453
By God, I'm gonna have an apple today.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.418
-Hi, Joel.
-Hey, Lisa. How you doing?

04:12.502 --> 04:14.545
I'm okay. Still no news about Dan.

04:15.171 --> 04:18.299
Oh, I'm sorry. That must be hard.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.051
-Yeah.
-Hello, Joel.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.552
You know what they say--

04:21.636 --> 04:24.138
"When God closes a door,
He always opens a window."

04:24.764 --> 04:26.349
With a breathtaking view.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.434
-Don't you start.
-[chuckles]

04:30.478 --> 04:32.897
-We're still praying for Dan.
-She loves God.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.565
He blesses everything we do.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.568
Well, He sure made you His instrument.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.736
Stop.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.322
How are you doing, Joel?

04:41.406 --> 04:44.659
I saw in the sheriff's log
you trashed Principal Novak's house.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.953
Yeah, Alondra said
you told her some crazy story

04:47.036 --> 04:48.538
about trying to move furniture?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.916
Yeah, she got that wrong.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.170
-So, why were you there?
-I drove over in my car.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.588
No, <i>why </i>were you there?

04:58.631 --> 05:00.717
[laughs] Oh. I'm sorry.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.928
I thought you said, "How was I there?"

05:04.470 --> 05:06.681
Which was by way of car.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.561
-Do you not wanna tell me, Joel?
-Of course I do.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.650
I was there to see his grandmother.
I volunteer to teach the elderly.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.278
Oh, that's sweet. What do you teach them?

05:21.195 --> 05:22.030
Dancing.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.657
[yells]
Sheila, we're gonna be late!

05:24.741 --> 05:27.285
You wrecked Principal Novak's
living room by dancing?

05:28.619 --> 05:30.621
Well, it was the salsa.

05:30.705 --> 05:35.251
And when you dance with <i>pasi√≥n</i>, as I do,
sometimes things get away from you.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.961
Salsa! [laughs]

05:37.712 --> 05:38.546
[door closes]

05:39.756 --> 05:41.424
-Oh, hey, guys.
-Hi.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.011
Joel was telling us he gave dance lessons
to Principal Novak's grandmother.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.013
Wha--? Yeah.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.806
He's a wonderful dancer.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.850
So you're both athletic.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.187
I saw you coming from your run.
I was heading out for mine.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.605
Oh. You run?

05:55.688 --> 05:57.648
Duh. Check out those "getaway sticks".

05:57.732 --> 05:58.566
Boom.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.903
-You need to stop.
-Why don't you make me, Officer?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.781
Well, we really should be going.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.533
Hey, Sheila,
we should go running together sometime.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.620
Now I'm hanging out with Blondie,
it'd be good to get to know you better.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.205
I would love that.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.957
Yeah, wouldn't that make sense?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.668
You and Deputy Garcia
getting to be friends.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.630
Speaking of friends, is it okay
if I bring Anne to dinner Tuesday night?

06:22.131 --> 06:24.550
Don't tell me you forgot.
You canceled last time.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.261
Shoot. Sheila, what's that thing
we have on Tuesday?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.472
Dinner with Lisa. And now with Anne.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.850
Yeah. That's what I was fishing for.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.605
We get rid of one cop,
now you bring another into our lives?

06:37.688 --> 06:38.940
You're too impulsive.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.234
At least let me do the talking
with Carl today.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.862
If you talk, you'll claim
you're the world's fastest tap dancer.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.988
Salsa.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.244
Maybe neither of us should talk to Carl.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.914
You're right, it's too dangerous.
Let's build your bookshelves.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.125
-Really?
-No. Drive.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.218
We have a problem. I got
another hit on our job board listing.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.178
Take it down. We got the bile.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.763
Unless you want more. Perv.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.474
I did take it down. Then I realized
there's an e-mail exchange

07:13.558 --> 07:15.351
between us and the Serb
your mom killed.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.062
If anyone investigates his disappearance,
they could find it.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.190
We need to access and delete e-mails
on his end. Do you have his cell phone?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.067
-No, my mom destroyed it.
-Shit!

07:23.818 --> 07:26.028
He didn't mention his password
before your mom killed him?

07:26.612 --> 07:30.283
Unless it was, "Ah! Oh, my God! Why?"
Then, no.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.534
That's clearly not helping.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.452
[phone chirps]

07:33.494 --> 07:34.328
[laughs]

07:34.412 --> 07:35.997
-Who's that?
-Just a friend.

07:36.080 --> 07:36.914
Eric.

07:36.998 --> 07:37.915
Hm?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.001
-Eric!
-Right. Okay.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.045
Uh, we need to get into his apartment
so we can use his computer.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.089
Darn. I have to miss school again.
Let's do it.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.424
Maybe we should tell your parents.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.885
I don't do that anymore.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.219
Oh.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.809
[crunching, licking]

07:57.018 --> 07:57.935
Hey, Carl.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.229
Hey, scrumptious. How's it going?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.356
I'm in a fucking bad mood.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.276
My four-year-old needs glasses
and my wife can't handle it.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.278
What do you people want?

08:07.862 --> 08:11.782
We want to come back at a later date
and tell you what we want. Right, honey?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.701
You're partnering
with that development company

08:13.784 --> 08:14.785
on some new homes.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.746
We should be the point people on that.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.415
That development's on hold
since Gary disappeared.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.836
-What does Gary have to do with it?
-The project needs a great salesman.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.880
That guy could sell farts to an asshole.

08:25.963 --> 08:29.091
Well, maybe <i>you </i>need
to have <i>your </i>eyes checked

08:29.175 --> 08:34.222
because you have two great salesmen
standing right here.

08:34.889 --> 08:38.935
Although,
they could also be standing right here.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.020
Come on, Carl,
are you gonna give up

08:41.103 --> 08:45.858
some awesome money making opportunity,
like the giant baby you look like?

08:45.942 --> 08:47.360
Excuse me?

08:47.443 --> 08:51.822
What she means is,
you have the skin of a young person

08:51.906 --> 08:54.242
along with childlike enthusiasm.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.285
That explains it.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.828
Fine.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.497
That development is high-end.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.832
There's a house on Linden Drive

09:01.916 --> 09:04.835
that is way pricier
than the shitboxes you sell.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.296
You bring me that listing, we'll talk.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.092
Deal. We'll get that listing
and <i>fuck it </i>like we're on vacation.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.805
What she means is,
we're gonna <i>get </i>that listing.

09:19.892 --> 09:20.893
[clicking]

09:22.436 --> 09:24.605
-[creaks]
-[both] Hello?

09:26.065 --> 09:27.608
Are you sure he lived alone?

09:27.692 --> 09:30.945
He sold vomit on the Internet.
I'm pretty sure there's not a Mrs. Right.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.115
-Let's delete the e-mails and get out.
-Okay.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.659
[door closes]

09:38.744 --> 09:39.579
Are you okay?

09:41.789 --> 09:42.915
It was really scary.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.584
Yeah, it must have been.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.129
I mean, he followed me home.
He was in my kitchen.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.006
I keep thinking
about what could have happened.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.424
Do you wanna talk about it?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.676
I am.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.637
Right, right. Go on.

09:57.805 --> 10:01.142
It really freaked me out.
I had to sleep with my parents last night.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.435
I'm sorry, Abby.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.687
-I should have been there.
-No, no.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.399
You were a hero. Your serum saved my mom.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.319
Besides, you're here now, so...

10:12.445 --> 10:14.530
[faint chirping]

10:14.614 --> 10:15.948
-[faint chirping]
-Sorry.

10:16.032 --> 10:16.991
[rapid chirping]

10:17.074 --> 10:19.619
-Let me get that.
-Okay, who keeps texting you?

10:19.702 --> 10:21.412
It's just this girl I met
at the Rite Aid last night.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.873
-Ramona.
-Oh!

10:23.956 --> 10:24.832
Oh, I met her.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.417
Anyway, we kind of hit it off,

10:26.500 --> 10:28.794
and she's been texting me
to hang out, so...

10:29.962 --> 10:30.796
Huh.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.800
-Is that a good "huh" or a bad "huh"?
-It's like a processing "huh".

10:34.884 --> 10:35.760
Oh.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.388
So, is that like a good processing "huh"?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.849
-We're breaking and entering right now.
-Right.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.520
-[keys clicking, beeps]
-[monitor beeping]

10:46.604 --> 10:47.647
Oh.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.692
-[beeping]
-Damn it. I can't get into his computer.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.153
He has a touch sensor.
We need his fingerprint.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.738
How are we gonna get his fingerprint?

10:58.866 --> 11:00.785
-No.
-Yeah.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.411
-Gross.
-Yeah.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.122
Okay. I'll get the key
to my parents' storage unit.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.585
My mom loves fingers, but she says
thumbs are like the ends of bread,

11:09.669 --> 11:11.087
so maybe we'll get lucky.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.050
And of course, the living room.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.803
This house is gonna show really well.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.888
The laundry room upstairs. Brilliant.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.681
Mm. Lot of memories.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.851
I raised two kids here.
Well, three if you count Rachel.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.895
Why wouldn't we count Rachel?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.313
Let's not open the Rachel box.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.150
Why we're not counting Rachel
is your business.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.444
-Well, there's Rachel.
-[tapping]

11:37.363 --> 11:38.280
[panting]

11:38.364 --> 11:41.867
You are my baby, you are my baby.
You're my bad baby.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.494
You leave scratches on the front door.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.538
You're always trying
to run out of Mommy's house.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.332
You know we can't let you go outside.
Never, never, never.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.875
Why can't Rachel run outside?

11:49.959 --> 11:52.044
-Because she will not wear her socks.
-[whimpers]

11:52.128 --> 11:54.755
Then her paws get dirty,
and I can't put 'em in my mouth

11:54.839 --> 11:57.007
and I kiss her like this--
mwah, mwah, mwah...

11:59.051 --> 12:00.678
Just leave it.

12:00.761 --> 12:01.762
[laughing]

12:02.430 --> 12:06.267
So, you think it's okay to deny Rachel
what's natural and normal to her?

12:06.350 --> 12:08.269
You think you know what's best for my dog?

12:08.352 --> 12:09.979
Of course not.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.315
Honey, maybe what feels natural
to Rachel isn't what's best.

12:13.399 --> 12:17.111
If she, Rachel, runs wild,
untethered, sockless,

12:17.194 --> 12:18.737
she could get into all kinds of trouble.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.741
She might even get caught
doing something unusual in the desert

12:22.825 --> 12:24.368
and get arrested.

12:24.869 --> 12:25.870
Tsk.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.872
You just wanna be yourself.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.041
-That's hard sometimes, isn't it?
-[gasps] She's kissing you.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.044
Rachel never kisses strangers.
This is a good sign.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.006
You know what else is a good sign?

12:37.089 --> 12:41.260
One in your yard
with our faces on it saying "Just Sold."

12:41.343 --> 12:42.386
[laughing]

12:42.887 --> 12:45.681
Let's talk about what kind of price
we can get for this.

12:46.682 --> 12:49.518
Ding-dong! Principal Residential.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.853
Oh, shit.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.980
We're early, I hope that's okay.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.940
I'm Chris, she's Christa.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.860
-Easy to remember, but if you forget...
-Check the tiramisu.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.279
Ooh--! [chuckles]
Mmm!

13:00.362 --> 13:01.906
-What a douchey move.
-Yeah.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.324
-We should do that.
-Yeah.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.911
-Sheila, Joel. How are you?
-You all know each other?

13:06.994 --> 13:09.622
Of course we know the Hammonds.
Are you feeling better now?

13:10.206 --> 13:15.044
Poor Sheila vomited all over
brand-new textured plush carpeting

13:15.127 --> 13:16.545
at a house they were showing.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.755
Ooh.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.757
They had to replace the flooring
under the carpet.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.675
That's not true, Chris.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.844
That carpet was stain-resistant,
you know that.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.889
We've known Chris and Christa
since high school.

13:26.972 --> 13:27.890
Oh.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.143
Chris is a few years older,
but we graduated at the same time.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.687
I'll let you do the math.
Because he couldn't.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.647
[laughing]

13:36.148 --> 13:38.234
Joel and I played football
against each other.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.152
Do you remember
the championship game, sport?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.570
Chris once drove drunk.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.324
Joel was quarterback for his team,
it was the final play of the game.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.701
Little guy drops back
and throws a Hail Mary.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.329
It was raining, the ball was wet.
That's important to know.

13:50.412 --> 13:53.165
The ball went sideways
and landed in the marching band

13:53.249 --> 13:55.459
and hit the bass drum.
Kaboom!

13:57.419 --> 13:59.797
They say if you put that drum
up against your ear,

13:59.880 --> 14:02.174
-you can still hear Joel crying.
-Mm.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.927
Listen, Becky, a lot of people
are gonna wanna sell your house,

14:05.010 --> 14:09.181
but I promise you,
we are the best damn realators in town.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.351
They're actually
the <i>only </i>"realators" in town,

14:12.434 --> 14:14.395
the rest of us pronounce it <i>"realtors".</i>

14:14.478 --> 14:15.563
Yeah, it's "realtors".

14:15.646 --> 14:19.441
That's what she said, "realators".
Wait, I heard the difference.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.778
But you know, it doesn't matter.
Both ways are correct.

14:22.862 --> 14:27.032
That's not true. One way is correct
and the other is profoundly ignorant.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.494
No, Joel's right.
You can say "realator" or "realator".

14:35.624 --> 14:39.211
Becky, show us the kitchen and I'll
slice everyone a piece of tiramisu.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.673
Unless you pronounce it <i>"tira-a-misu."</i>

14:42.756 --> 14:44.550
-[laughs]
-That's funny.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.887
Chris flipped his dad's car.
It was in the papers.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.598
Listen, bitch.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.934
You keep talking shit about us,
and I swear to God I will drop you.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.270
Try it and I'll kick your twat
so far up your throat

14:56.353 --> 14:57.938
you'll get pregnant giving blowjobs.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.065
Whoa!

15:00.566 --> 15:01.692
[door closes]

15:01.775 --> 15:02.776
I hate them.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.654
-I hate how tall he still is.
-Oh, we are screwed.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.365
No. Becky said she's not deciding
till tomorrow.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.992
We have to win this.
We have to crush them.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.161
-I wanna make it hurt.
-Mm.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.498
-What?
-I like competitive Joel. It's hot.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.834
Better than you wanting
to putter around the house.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.337
Fuck puttering! Fuck Chris and Christa!

15:22.004 --> 15:23.339
Fuck tiramisu.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.591
Hey, as long as you're fucking
everything...

15:29.178 --> 15:30.763
[both gasp, moan]

15:30.846 --> 15:32.097
[sighs]

15:32.181 --> 15:34.808
If we did that more often,
you wouldn't have to chase rabbits.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.145
I don't think you realize
the kind of energy I have now.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.022
I don't wanna break you.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.609
What are we gonna do
about Chris and Christa?

15:45.736 --> 15:46.862
We could kill them.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.907
We can't solve all our problems
with murder.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.284
-How about just this problem?
-No.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.619
We're not killing them.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.620
Right.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.957
We could kill one of them.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.584
That'd be a tough call,
they're both such dicks.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.672
No, we have to do something
that doesn't involve murder.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.715
Hmm.

16:10.052 --> 16:10.928
[sighs]

16:14.014 --> 16:17.851
Boy, if you take killing off the table,
we really don't have a lot of moves.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.729
No, we really don't.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.567
What about kidnapping?

16:26.485 --> 16:29.655
Why don't governments do more
to stop that?

16:29.738 --> 16:30.906
Oh, hi, honey.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.367
We were just discussing
international affairs.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.120
Last night I saw you swallow
a man's tongue like an oyster.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.456
Don't you think it's ridiculous
for us to keep lying to each other?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.542
You're right. I'm sorry. How was school?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.377
It was good.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.296
Did you see Eric?
How's he doing after last night?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.716
While he was at Rite Aid
picking up cleaning supplies,

16:48.799 --> 16:51.051
the oddly insightful girl who works there
asked him out.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.302
I think he's doing okay.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.347
Eric's dating the Rite Aid girl?
Good for him, huh?

16:55.431 --> 16:56.598
Yeah, I guess.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.143
I mean, he's giggling a lot now,
so, that's new.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.981
You know,
it's hard to share your best friend.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.608
You just have to think
about what makes Eric happy.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.652
Oh, Mom. No. No, no, no.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.031
I don't need life advice from people
who were plotting a kidnapping.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.619
We were brainstorming.
If the Wright brothers

17:17.703 --> 17:20.205
had you as a daughter,
we'd have never conquered the sky.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.333
-[door closes]
-I thought you gave her good advice.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.919
Put other people's needs above her own.
We should all do that.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.005
We <i>should </i>all do that.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.049
Are you talking about what happened
in the bedroom?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.176
-Because I did my level best.
-No.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.470
We became so preoccupied
with Chris and Christa,

17:34.553 --> 17:35.804
we lost sight of the client.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.806
We need to get back
to what's important to her.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.227
Don't worry about the bedroom.
I know how hard I work you up there.

17:42.728 --> 17:46.315
It's not work, honey.
But I could use more water breaks.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.530
Should I carve it into a swan
or a dolphin?

17:54.573 --> 17:56.784
Wait. I don't think
you should have to do this,

17:56.867 --> 18:00.829
unless chiseling this block of creep
will help you feel better.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.748
-Thanks.
-No problem.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.250
I worked a snow cone cart
one summer, so...

18:06.376 --> 18:07.753
[tapping]

18:11.673 --> 18:13.509
Hey, you should go out with Ramona.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.763
I don't wanna be the girl
who holds a friend back

18:17.846 --> 18:20.516
because they have a three-percent
chance of winding up together.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.392
And I like her.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.020
I want you to be happy.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.149
-Did you say a three-percent chance?
-Really? That's all you heard?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.944
No, I also heard you want me to be happy.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.737
Thank you.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.906
You're welcome.

18:35.989 --> 18:36.990
[chuckles]

18:37.991 --> 18:39.326
-[tapping]
-Ooh, there.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.036
-Where?
-I think that's a thumb.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.163
-[tapping]
-[crackling]

18:49.128 --> 18:51.964
-It's stuck to his nose.
-Should I pull it apart?

18:52.047 --> 18:54.258
-No. We might lose the thumbprint.
-What do we do?

18:58.887 --> 19:01.849
-So, defrost?
-I guess.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.935
-"Poultry" or "leftovers"?
-I know it's not popcorn.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.815
Anybody could get you
a good price for this house.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.526
So let's talk about
what's really important to you.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.195
There is a lot of love in this home.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.948
We noticed that in the pencil marks
in Kyle's room

19:18.031 --> 19:19.700
that tracked his height all those years.

19:19.783 --> 19:23.245
And in the jungle mural you painted
for Maggie in her room.

19:23.328 --> 19:27.916
We wanna find another family
that will fill this home with memories,

19:28.000 --> 19:33.338
and we promise we'll do that, if you do us
the honor of making us your <i>realators.</i>

19:33.797 --> 19:35.799
-Realtors.
-Both are correct.

19:35.883 --> 19:36.842
That's lovely.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.010
[both gasp]

19:38.093 --> 19:40.262
I was going to wait until tomorrow
to decide, but--

19:40.345 --> 19:41.930
Ding-dong!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.182
Unbelievable.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.685
You can't waltz into people's homes
'cause you say, "Ding-dong."

19:46.768 --> 19:50.230
So sorry to interrupt,
but we just got some great news.

19:50.314 --> 19:54.234
We sold Johnny Depp's manager's house
for above asking.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.988
And he agreed that you can come
to set and meet Johnny,

19:58.071 --> 20:00.574
who is in LA right now making a movie.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.201
Oh, my God.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.037
-This is unreal.
-We thought you'd like that.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.831
We noticed half your DVDs
were Johnny Depp movies.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.792
While we were staring
at Maggie's racist jungle mural.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.545
Is there any more
of that <i>"tira-a-misu" </i>left?

20:14.379 --> 20:15.464
Of course.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.798
None for you.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.343
-[Rachel whines]
-[sighs]

20:27.184 --> 20:28.810
Where are you going?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.604
We've been talking about doing
what's best for people.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.732
I haven't done that for you.
You need to run free, chase things.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.444
That's really sweet,
but that's what you're thinking about now?

20:37.527 --> 20:40.906
Yes, because you need to run
and chase things.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.742
-Now.
-[whines]

20:48.205 --> 20:50.082
-Oh, no!
-[Becky] <i>What?</i>

20:50.624 --> 20:53.001
I was gathering our stuff up.
I noticed Chris left the door open,

20:53.085 --> 20:53.919
and Rachel got out.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.420
[wails] No!

20:56.338 --> 20:57.339
I'm on it.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.566
[grunts]

21:18.735 --> 21:20.779
Finally, a worthy adversary.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.368
[barks]

21:28.704 --> 21:31.248
You may be faster than me,
but I never tire.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.541
Just ask my husband.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.256
I hope we didn't overcook it.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.301
It's really puckered.
Like it fell asleep in a bathtub.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.262
[beeps]

21:46.388 --> 21:47.973
[chirping, beeping]

21:48.056 --> 21:49.641
-It worked!
-Oh, thank God.

21:49.850 --> 21:50.684
[phone chirping]

21:53.353 --> 21:57.399
Okay, that is the 20th text from Ramona.
Are you gonna ask her out, or what?

21:57.482 --> 22:00.736
One day. Right now,
I'm living the fantasy of what might be,

22:00.819 --> 22:03.280
rather than the inevitable reality
of me blowing it.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.907
-And...
-[keyboard clicks]

22:05.991 --> 22:07.993
There. Done.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.287
-We don't have to go to jail.
-Yes!

22:10.370 --> 22:11.455
Let's get out of here.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.665
-[rattling]
-Shit. Someone's coming.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.125
[rattling]

22:17.210 --> 22:18.170
We're going to jail.

22:20.130 --> 22:20.964
Whoa!

22:22.341 --> 22:23.258
Who are you?

22:23.925 --> 22:24.760
Who are you?

22:26.219 --> 22:27.262
We're friends of Goran.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.931
So are we. Why are you wearing gloves?

22:30.015 --> 22:31.141
Why are <i>you </i>wearing gloves?

22:32.517 --> 22:33.643
We're teen hand models.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.147
And we have to protect our assets
from sun damage.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.441
-Right, Charlotte?
-That's right... Hank.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.942
-Yep.
-And you?

22:42.319 --> 22:44.696
We're wearing gloves
because we're janitors

22:44.780 --> 22:46.323
on our way to our janitor jobs.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.909
Yeah. And we hate changing there.

22:49.618 --> 22:53.872
Well, we're off to a photo shoot
with a watch company,

22:53.955 --> 22:56.917
and as I'm sure you can imagine,
they are very punctual.

22:57.000 --> 22:57.834
[Eric] Yes.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.631
-[door closes]
-Were they here for the bile?

23:02.714 --> 23:05.425
-You heard everything I heard, Marsha.
-You think they're with us?

23:05.509 --> 23:10.055
Hmm. Well, based on my having
the identical information you have,

23:10.138 --> 23:11.056
I don't know.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.352
-Who were those guys?
-You heard everything I heard, Eric.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.400
Why are we at the Rite Aid?

23:22.484 --> 23:25.237
'Cause Ramona's in there.
And you're gonna ask her out.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.613
-Now?
-Yeah.

23:26.696 --> 23:30.909
She obviously wants to see you.
Just ask her to lunch or something.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.037
-What's the worst that could happen?
-[gasps]

23:36.498 --> 23:37.332
You're right.

23:38.959 --> 23:39.918
You only live once.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.839
-Go on, get outta here.
-Okay.

23:46.842 --> 23:50.137
You know, I'll always be there for you.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.391
Don't forget, you have a defrosted thumb
in your pocket.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.308
Right.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.689
Whew. Okay.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.450
-If anything happens to that dog.
-There's no way I left the door open.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.870
I recall you also denied
flipping your dad's car.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.414
Look.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.672
You got her.

24:27.174 --> 24:30.844
-Oh, thank you! Thank you!
-No problem.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.387
We're "realators", ma'am.

24:32.470 --> 24:35.473
And we have the extra syllable
because we go the extra mile.

24:35.557 --> 24:39.186
You are such a naughty girl, Rachel.
Look how dirty you are.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.022
I'm gonna get you a wet towel
and your robe.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.148
I'll take her.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.317
-[barks]
-No, thank you.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.027
Joel?

24:47.611 --> 24:48.528
Oh, yeah.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.739
[Rachel whimpers]

24:57.746 --> 24:59.497
You screwed us, didn't you, half-pint?

24:59.581 --> 25:01.625
"Half-pint?" Dude, I'm 6'1".

25:01.708 --> 25:06.213
And I'm 6'4", which makes me...
three inches taller than you.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.881
Not tall enough to block my Hail Mary.

25:07.964 --> 25:10.133
[whistles] Booh!

25:10.217 --> 25:13.553
Ah! Ah! Ah!
[mimics cheering]

25:13.637 --> 25:16.056
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

25:16.139 --> 25:18.183
-Whoop!
-Don't spike the dog.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.899
We got it. We got the listing.
That's the client's signature there.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.944
Who are you building homes
with now, huh? Us.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.403
Bam!

25:30.487 --> 25:33.782
Good job. I had zero faith in you two.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.369
But now, seeing this,
I have the tiniest amount.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.620
Careful. We'll get cocky.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.790
Well, get familiar with the site map.
I'll call the geologists

25:41.873 --> 25:43.792
and get them out there
as soon as possible.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.378
Congratulations, I guess.

25:46.461 --> 25:50.131
Bring it in.
Mama wants to hold the baby.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.301
You cut that "baby" shit out right now.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.803
You got it.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.847
Shall we look at our future?

25:59.057 --> 26:00.392
I guess we're really doing this.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.938
[sighs]

26:05.021 --> 26:07.190
-Look at it.
-Yeah.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.153
Is that where we buried Gary?

26:13.321 --> 26:14.489
Yeah.

26:18.034 --> 26:19.619
[coyote howls]

26:24.749 --> 26:27.752
-Are we bad people?
-I don't think so.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.587
A thousand square miles of desert

26:29.671 --> 26:32.674
and they're building
right where we buried your first kill.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.092
Maybe we're being punished.

26:34.175 --> 26:38.513
Or maybe someone just has low blood sugar
and should have stopped for tacos

26:38.596 --> 26:41.099
-like I suggested.
-This isn't low blood sugar.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.476
We do a lot of things
that aren't so great.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.272
We won the listing in an underhanded way.
We lie to our neighbors.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.232
And, of course, kill people.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.776
We only kill bad people.
Our neighbors like us.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.446
And I thought the way we got the listing
was clever.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.240
I don't think we're bad.
Maybe we're just bold.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.117
[man] Yeah, you guys are fantastic.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.457
Holy shit!

27:07.250 --> 27:08.084
Gary?

27:08.668 --> 27:09.961
What did you do to me?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.380
[coyote howls]
