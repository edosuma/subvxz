00:04.700 --> 00:05.800
Morning, Charlie.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.400
Charlie.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.200
Good, I don't have to give him
mouth-to-mouth.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.000
Morning.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.300
He sleeping?

00:23.300 --> 00:24.500
Sure, let's call it sleep.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.200
Uncle Charlie, I'm gonna have
a bowl of Maple Loops.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.000
You want one?

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:43.100 --> 00:44.500
You sure he's okay?

00:44.500 --> 00:46.500
I never said
he was okay.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.400
Freaky.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.000
You really shouldn't
see him like this, Jake.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.500
There. Now you can
enjoy your breakfast.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
What's wrong with him?

01:10.400 --> 01:12.000
Oh, he's getting old, kiddo.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.300
I wish you could've
seen him in his prime.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.000
He was like Babe Ruth.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.500
He played baseball?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.400
No, he was a drunken
whore-monger.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.900
But there was none better.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.300
Oh, God, look what the cat
dragged in.

01:28.300 --> 01:31.000
He didn't just drag it,
he ate it, pooped it out

01:31.000 --> 01:32.300
and then covered it with sand.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.300
You know what'd be funny?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.500
To paint a big mustache on him.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.300
That would be hilarious...

01:40.900 --> 01:41.700
but no.

01:43.100 --> 01:43.900
Charlie?

01:45.700 --> 01:46.500
Charlie?

01:47.500 --> 01:48.400
Yeah?

01:49.600 --> 01:50.400
You okay?

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
Yeah.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.200
What time did
you get home?

01:55.500 --> 01:56.800
I'm home?

02:00.300 --> 02:01.300
You are.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.000
Oh, God, I'm blind.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.900
It's a miracle.

Okaysee you tomorrow.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.100
Good night, Berta.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.100
Hey.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.200
Look who's finally up.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.800
How'd you sleep?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.000
Okay, I guess.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.900
Good, I'm glad.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.500
Oh, Tater Tots.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.700
Help yourself.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.800
Jake, I said no.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.800
I didn't dot.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.600
He didn't.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.600
What are you staring at?

03:37.900 --> 03:39.700
Nothing, se?r.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200
So, uh, how are you feeling?

03:44.700 --> 03:45.600
Depends.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
What day is it?

03:48.700 --> 03:49.500
Saturday.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.300
Oh.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.000
Well, in that case I feel great.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.100
Why "in that case"?

03:54.300 --> 03:56.400
If it was Thursday,
I'd be a little worried.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.700
I don't know, Charlie,
you've been pushing it
pretty hard lately.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.800
What do you mean?

04:00.800 --> 04:02.100
I mean you're not a kid anymore.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.500
Oh, please.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.200
I'm in the best shape
of my life.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.800
Now, that doesn't belong
inside of me.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.300
It takes a lot to gross me out,
but wow.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.200
Hey, get your stuff together.
I'm going to bring you
back to your mom's.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.400
Let me tell you something, Alan.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.900
You're only as young
as the women you feel.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.900
And lately,
I've been feeling about 24.

04:31.900 --> 04:32.900
Twenty-four?

04:33.100 --> 04:35.000
Yep, and she doesn't think
I'm old.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.400
She thinks I'm cute and fun.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.200
And rich.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.200
Yeah, the rich helps.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.200
I'm not that cute.

04:40.700 --> 04:41.600
Okay, fine.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.700
I understand the allure,
the nectar of the young berry.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.600
But I also know what happens
when you burn a candle
at both ends.

04:50.000 --> 04:50.800
How would you know that?

04:50.800 --> 04:53.300
Did you take a candle-making
class at the Learning Annex?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.800
Hey, I have done my share
of walking on the wild side.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.300
The wild side?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.500
Okay, the rambunctious side.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.600
My point is there comes a time
in a man's life

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
when he has to start accepting
his limitations.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.300
Yeah, well, my point is the day
you start accepting limitations

05:09.300 --> 05:11.200
is the day you start dying.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.000
And I'm not dying, my friend;

05:14.000 --> 05:16.300
????????

05:18.300 --> 05:19.500
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:19.700 --> 05:21.400
I'm gonna go throw
up and take a nap.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.000
That was fun!

05:31.000 --> 05:31.900
Yeah.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.900
How long until
you're ready to go again?

05:34.300 --> 05:35.300
You mean tonight?

05:36.600 --> 05:37.800
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.100
You're old.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.300
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not old.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.200
I'm just not a...
yogurt dispenser.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.800
You're almost
as olds my dad.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.600
All right, listen,
if you're looking to go again,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.000
that's not the way
get there.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Aw, did I hurt your feelings?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.900
No, no, you didn't hurt
my feelings.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.700
It's just, you know,
there are certain

05:57.700 --> 06:00.100
biological factors
you have to take into account...

06:00.100 --> 06:01.500
Yeah, my dad takes Viagra.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.600
Good for him.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.400
All I'm saying is

06:07.400 --> 06:09.000
we could do something else
for a while

06:09.000 --> 06:10.400
and then come back to this.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.600
Great, let's go to a club.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.400
Now?

06:13.100 --> 06:14.400
It's 11:00.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.900
So we'll get there early.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.900
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of

06:19.900 --> 06:23.000
<i>making some toaster pizzas
and watching The Daily Show.</i>

06:24.600 --> 06:25.700
Oh.

06:25.700 --> 06:26.500
What?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.700
I'm bored.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.900
If we're not gonna have sex,
I nt to go out.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.300
Okay, tell you what,
why don't you go out

06:35.300 --> 06:37.600
and, you know,
boogie-oogie-oogie,

06:38.700 --> 06:41.100
and when you come back,
wake me up and we'll have sex.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.700
That's a lame idea, Charlie.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.600
Okay, you can skip
the waking me up part.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.400
I'm just gonna go
call some friends.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.500
No, no, wait, wait.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.500
Come here, come he.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.300
I think I'm ready
to go again.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.400
Really?
Really.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.000
I got nothing--
let's go dancing.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.800
Yeah, I'm coming with the guy
I told you about, the old guy.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.000
I don't know.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.800
I think he's got a little
brother who's old, too.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.900
I'll ask him.

07:17.900 --> 07:18.800
Great, we'll see you there.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.400
Hey, do you think your brother
would want tcome with us?

07:21.800 --> 07:22.600
Alan?

07:22.600 --> 07:24.000
No, he's not the type.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.200
He'd be miserable going to
a dance club at this hour.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.200
Wait here, I'll go get him.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.000
Hey.
Oh, you just missed it.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.800
Jon Stewart made a very clever
joke about the budget deficit.

07:37.900 --> 07:38.900
Swell.

07:38.900 --> 07:40.400
Get dressed,
we're going dancing.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.500
Yeah, right.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.300
Toaster pizza?

07:42.300 --> 07:44.900
No, come on, let's go.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.900
You're serious?
Yes.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.900
But it's after 11:00,
and I'm all tucked in.

07:51.000 --> 07:51.900
Too bad.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.300
I'm drinking nighty-night tea.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.800
Come on, Robin
wants to go dancing,

07:56.800 --> 07:58.200
and I'm gonna need
a designated driver.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.600
Hey, just 'cause you're
making a fool of yourself

08:00.600 --> 08:02.300
trying to keep up
with a 24-year-old girl,

08:02.300 --> 08:03.500
doesn't mean I have to join you.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.500
She has a 24-year-old
girlfriend.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.500
Is it dressy-dressy
or dressy-casual?

08:14.100 --> 08:15.900
Just take it.
Maybe it'll
loosen you up.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
I don't think so.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.400
Recent studies
indicate that ecstasy

08:20.400 --> 08:22.100
may well deplete
your spinal fluid.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.700
ah, so?

08:24.700 --> 08:27.000
So?
Young lady,
I am a chiropractor.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.700
Whoo.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.000
You know what,

08:31.200 --> 08:32.400
my date isn't working out.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.799
Well, maybe
you'd get somewhere

08:34.799 --> 08:36.799
if you stopped talking to her
like you're her fher.

08:36.799 --> 08:40.100
Well, somebody has to,
because her real father
has obviously dropped the ball.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.799
Oh, wonderful, a smoker.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.300
So I guess you're counting on
stem cell research

08:46.300 --> 08:48.100
to replace your spine
and lungs.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.000
Alan, Alan,
you're embarrassing me.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.200
I'm embarrassing you?
Look at yourself.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.000
You're standing in
line in a dank alley

08:58.000 --> 08:59.600
in the middle of
the Urine District.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.700
Hey, this is the hippest
club in town.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.800
Oh, hip, schmip-- it's
a toilet with a doorman.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.300
Somebody lit a doobie.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.500
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,

09:12.700 --> 09:14.000
that is definitely
the ganja.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.300
Great, now we're all
gonna get busted.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.800
Will you just relax
and let yourself have some fun?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.400
Oh, this is fun for you?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.300
Exhaust fumes
and reefer smoke?

09:24.300 --> 09:25.400
Let me tell you
something, Charlie.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
I'm not a kid anymore.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.600
I need plenty of
rest, exercise and a gh-fiber
diet, and...

09:30.100 --> 09:32.300
Oh, perfect, I just
stepped on a condom.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.600
Go ahead,
have a good time.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.400
Hold it.
We're with them.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.500
I don't think so.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.700
No, no, we are.
Although truth be told,

09:42.700 --> 09:44.500
I don't see a long-term
relationship in the offing.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.300
You understand.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.300
Don't touch the rope.

09:48.700 --> 09:49.500
Sorry.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.000
I didn't realize you
were king of the rope.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.000
(softly):
Shut up, Alan.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Look, if you're not
on the list,
you're not getting in.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.300
You let the girls in.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.700
Alan.
He let the girls in.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.800
That's because pretty girls
dress up the place.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
Watch how this works.

10:06.000 --> 10:06.800
Listen...

10:07.500 --> 10:09.700
why don't you check
your list for Jackson.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.100
Andrew Jackson.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.900
Nope.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.500
Got Tito and LaToya.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.200
Okay.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
What if I change
my name to...

10:26.800 --> 10:28.400
Ulysses S. Grant?

10:28.800 --> 10:30.700
You can change your name
to Condoleezza Rice.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.200
If you're not on the li
and you're not a celebrity,

10:34.200 --> 10:35.000
you're not getting in.

10:37.100 --> 10:37.900
All right, look,

10:37.900 --> 10:39.600
I didn't want to have
to play this card,

10:39.600 --> 10:40.900
but I'm Charlie Harper.

10:40.900 --> 10:41.900
I'm in the music business.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.900
I wrote
the Maple Loops jingle.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.300
Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.100
Oh, I love those cookies.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.900
Great.
You got any on you?

10:52.100 --> 10:53.000
No.
Beat it.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.200
Charlie, let me
handle this.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
Sir...

11:01.500 --> 11:03.100
I am Matthew Broderick.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.300
Who?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.900
Bruno, they're with me.

11:08.100 --> 11:08.900
Are you sure?

11:09.400 --> 11:10.900
This is a good chance
to cut 'em loose.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.100
Guys, come on.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.700
Matthew Broderick
is a gifted actor????????

11:27.600 --> 11:30.400
Oh, for God's sake, will
yostop complaining?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.600
Well, I'm sorry, but
the music in that club
was so loud,

11:32.600 --> 11:33.700
my ears
are still ringing.

11:37.900 --> 11:38.800
You know what
that sound is?

11:38.800 --> 11:41.500
That is the sound of the little
hairs in my middle ear dying.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.200
I am talking permanent
hearing loss, Charlie.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.600
Those little hairs
don't grow back.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.200
Oh, wait, let's
see something.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.500
* Ah.... C-Sharp... *

12:02.000 --> 12:05.800
* C-Sharp is the sound
of encroaching deafness. *

12:06.400 --> 12:08.500
Listen to you;
you're like an old man.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.800
I can't listen to me.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.900
All I hear is... * Ah... *

12:14.300 --> 12:15.600
Worst night of my life.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.700
u're just ticked off
because you couldn't keep up.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.500
I couldn't keep up?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.300
I was out on the dance floor
with the girls

12:22.300 --> 12:23.700
while you were sleeping
in the booth.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.100
I wasn't sleeping.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.600
I was closing my eyes,

12:27.600 --> 12:29.800
because I couldn't bear
to watch you do this.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.800
I was voguing.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.400
You were napping.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.400
Nobody vogues anymore, Alan.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.400
And guess what?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.500
Nobody does the robot
anymore, either.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.100
Oh, yeah?

12:49.100 --> 12:50.700
Then why did it catch on
with the other dancers?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.900
It di't catch on.
They were openly mocking you.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.200
What do you want from me?

12:56.200 --> 12:59.000
I went out to the club,
I went to the after-hours club,

12:59.000 --> 13:00.200
I went out to breakfast,

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
I held my date's hair

13:01.200 --> 13:03.200
while she vomited pancakes
in the parking lot.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.200
Well, if you weren't whining
about wanting to go home,

13:07.200 --> 13:09.200
you'd be having sex
with her right now.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.800
Oh, darn. What man doesn't dream
of kissing second-hand pancakes?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.300
And I have to go to work.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.100
You know what?

13:18.200 --> 13:20.500
You are a fuddy-duddy.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.200
I'm... I'm a fuddy-duddy?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.900
Hey, if the orthopedic shoe
fits, wear it.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.600
They are not orthopedic.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.300
They merely have a reinforced
arch for the active lifestyle.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.000
<i>And you were napping.</i>

13:34.400 --> 13:36.400
Okay, maybe I needed
a little shut-eye.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.100
But that's only because
I had vigorous sex earlier.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.600
Oh, let's fa it.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.500
We're both too old
for the MTV lifestyle.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
MTV?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.000
Did they just defrost you?

13:48.900 --> 13:52.800
Okay... MTV, VH-1,
whatever the kids are watching.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.700
My point is,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.400
I am comfortable
acting my age,

13:56.400 --> 13:57.800
while you are in deep denial.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.700
Hey, hey, I am not in denial
about anything.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.600
I am a young, vibrant man
in the prime of my life.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
I-- (coughs)

14:11.600 --> 14:12.400
What?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.800
Young people have phlegm, too.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.000
Sure.

14:17.700 --> 14:18.600
Anyway...

14:18.600 --> 14:19.400
as I was...

14:22.600 --> 14:23.500
Oh, God.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.300
What's the matter

14:26.400 --> 14:27.300
My chest.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.100
Are you okay?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.000
I don't know...

14:32.600 --> 14:33.400
Hey, Alan...

14:33.600 --> 14:34.400
Yeah?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.900
Do you think it's too late
to start jogging?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.200
ALAN:
Damn it, what kind
of hospital is this?!

14:43.200 --> 14:44.700
Where the hell
are the doctors?

14:44.700 --> 14:46.100
That's my brother
in there!

14:46.100 --> 14:48.300
If he dies,
I'm homeless!

14:54.300 --> 14:55.500
Uh, everything's fine.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.100
They're just going
to run some tests.

14:59.100 --> 14:59.900
Not to worry.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.200
Easy for you tsay.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.400
Listen, Alan,
if I don't make it,

15:06.200 --> 15:07.300
you need to know
about my will.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.200
Hey, I don't want to hear
that kind of tal
You're going to make it.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.500
But go on, finish
what you were saying.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.400
First of all,

15:18.600 --> 15:20.200
I left the house
to you and Jake.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.000
Yes!

15:24.600 --> 15:25.700
You're going to make it.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.700
Just so you know,
there's two mortgages on it

15:31.700 --> 15:34.500
and the property taxes
are $50,000 a year.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.000
Really? $50,000?

15:40.500 --> 15:42.900
Uh, excuse me.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.600
Do you got to flat line
to get a little help
around here?!

15:51.400 --> 15:54.300
Do you got to move
to Canada to get some
decent medical care?!

15:56.900 --> 15:57.900
Uh, they'll be right here.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.900
So, uh... 50 grand, hu

16:02.400 --> 16:03.400
Boy, I don't know...

16:04.400 --> 16:05.700
how I could afford that.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.700
You know, unless I came
into some money, you know.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.100
An inheritance or something.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.400
There's no money, Alan.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.000
None?

16:14.400 --> 16:16.300
The whole thing's
a house of cards.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.300
Huh.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.200
Okay, I did not want
to have to do this.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.800
But I am Matthew Broderick.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.900
And that is my brother
lying there.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.400
MAN:
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Broderick.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.000
<i>I loved you
in The oducers.</i>

16:37.000 --> 16:37.800
Thank you.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.400
Okay, let's have
a look-see, huh?

16:43.800 --> 16:46.800
According to your tests,
you just had an acute
attack of indigestion.

16:49.900 --> 16:50.900
It was gas?

16:50.900 --> 16:53.100
Yes, a big bubble,
about the size
of a pomegranate.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.200
What have you had
to eat recently?

16:56.400 --> 16:57.800
Nothing much.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.800
He had Belgian waffles,
link sausages, two Red Bulls,

17:00.800 --> 17:01.900
a quart of scotch

17:01.900 --> 17:03.900
and the tongue of
a 24-year-old actress.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.800
He asked what I ate, Alan.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.700
And I told him, Charlie.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.400
Oh-ho, you're
a dirty bird.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.800
Well, the good news is that you
are a perfectly healthy
50-year-old man.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.800
I'm only 40.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.099
Tell that to
your liver.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.700
I recommend you slow down a bit.
I've been saying the same thing.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.599
And you...

17:27.300 --> 17:29.600
<i>Why no sequel to
Ferris Bueller, huh?</i>

17:30.300 --> 17:31.700
I wait and I wait.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.300
I'm sorry;
I'll get on it.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.100
Ah. Give the people
what they want.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.200
So, gas.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.000
Good news, huh?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.700
A little embarrassing, but yeah.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.600
What do you have
to be embarrassed about?

17:51.800 --> 17:55.100
Oh, I don't know-- the
paramedics, thambulance,

17:55.100 --> 17:57.700
the crying and the last-minute
negotiations with God.

17:58.900 --> 17:59.700
Oh, right.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.200
Are you still planning
on teaching piano to orphans?

18:02.400 --> 18:03.600
If any show up, sure.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.200
Well, will you at least
accept the fact

18:07.200 --> 18:08.600
that you have to slow down?

18:10.300 --> 18:11.800
Yeah, yeah.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.800
It's weird, Alan.

18:16.300 --> 18:20.300
It seems like just yesterday I
could... I could party all night

18:20.800 --> 18:22.600
and eat and drink
anything I wanted to.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.100
Now a couple of Red Bulls
and a waffle,

18:25.100 --> 18:27.700
and I'm sitting in the emergency
room praying for a fart.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.700
Now you know why I ordered
tomato juice and cottage cheese.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
I got to admit, yodo
take good care of yourself.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.000
I try.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.700
I guess that's why
I keep you around.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.300
Because I'm a good example?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.600
No, you clod,
spare parts.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.000
What are we watching?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.200
<i>Antiques Roadshow.</i>

18:56.800 --> 18:59.400
This woman thinks she has
Martha Washington's
butter churn.

19:02.700 --> 19:03.800
Toaster pizza?

19:04.500 --> 19:05.300
Thank you.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.500
So, you going
out tonight?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.100
Eh, what's the point?

19:10.800 --> 19:13.400
Look, Charlie, I'm glad
you're slowing down a bit,

19:13.400 --> 19:15.500
but you haven't been out
of the house in a week.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.600
Eh, it's too depressing.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.400
Wherever I go,
I'm the oldest guy in the room.

19:21.900 --> 19:22.700
Even here.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.600
Hey, what would you think
about getting a cat?

19:32.300 --> 19:33.100
Okay, that's it.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.000
Put some clothes on.
We're going out.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.800
It's 9:00.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.300
I was going to make
some kettle corn.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.600
Forget the corn;
you're coming with me.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Where are we going?

19:42.000 --> 19:42.800
You'll see.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.900
Can you drive?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.200
I don't like to drive
at night.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.100
What the hell is
this place?

19:53.100 --> 19:54.500
The fountain of youth.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.500
What?

19:55.500 --> 19:56.300
Follow me.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.600
Ooh, look, young stuff.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.300
??????????

20:14.800 --> 20:16.700
May I ask you
a personal question?

20:17.500 --> 20:18.300
Sure.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.700
How old are you?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.200
I just turned 40.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.700
Oh, you're a baby.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.400
well
Yeah.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.200
Hey, I have a little
riddle for you.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.300
All right.

20:32.700 --> 20:36.100
What has multiple
orgasms and hums?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I give up.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.400
Come on, I'll show you.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.000
Alan...

20:52.800 --> 20:53.700
Alan, I'm leaving.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.600
And may God bless you.
