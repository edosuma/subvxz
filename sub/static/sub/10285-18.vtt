WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:06.707
Previously on ER:

00:06.774 --> 00:08.476
I'm in love with you.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.144
RASGOTRA:
I don't know
why I'm being so crazy.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.513
I don't know why
I couldn't tell you.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.015
It's because
we've become friends.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.351
Started out with 14.
Now they're down to five.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.919
But you're still standing.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.821
But nothing will
make them focus on you

00:20.888 --> 00:22.156
like getting another offer.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.092
"Headhunters"?
What? Are you leaving us?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.094
I have to move out.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.528
DANIEL:
You got to save her!

00:27.595 --> 00:29.630
You got to save her right here,
right now

00:29.697 --> 00:31.031
or no one's leaving.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.778 --> 00:47.047
I-I don't know
what else to tell you.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.383
It's up to you.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.686
I got nothing.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.288
No, I'm sleeping fine.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.224
Work's good. I'm good...

00:56.290 --> 00:59.493
Surprised...
you know, that I'm okay.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.695
Didn't think I would be.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.297
I mean, who would?

01:04.031 --> 01:05.999
But, uh...

01:06.066 --> 01:07.635
I am.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.071
Hostage situations
are very traumatizing,

01:11.139 --> 01:13.141
especially when there's
a fatality involved.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.476
Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.650
Are-are we done?

01:22.716 --> 01:24.485
If you want to be.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.822
Okay, then, yeah. Yeah.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.259
I'm here anytime, Dr. Morris.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.294
Feel free to drop by,

01:33.361 --> 01:35.463
call and set up an appointment,

01:35.529 --> 01:38.366
whatever.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.003
I don't want to go
to school today.

01:43.070 --> 01:46.307
Mm, I don't want to have surgery
today, but look at me.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.975
Come here and give
Mommy a kiss.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.178
Come here.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.747
Be right back.
Be back in an hour.
Okay, mm-hmm.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.183
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.117
Be good today.
We will.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.189
You all right?

02:02.356 --> 02:04.458
Yeah, yeah.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.227
Fourth time's a charm, right?

02:06.294 --> 02:08.628
Yep. I think I heard that
somewhere, too.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.303
So you've been at County
since you were a nurse, right?

02:15.369 --> 02:16.404
You must like it.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.606
Yeah. Amazing people.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.641
It's hard to imagine
being anyplace else.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.410
It feels like home?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.612
Yes, sad, but true.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.114
Yeah, I did some time
in a county hospital.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.550
In the trenches,
the adrenaline...

02:29.617 --> 02:31.151
it's great
and frustrating.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.286
Constantly

02:32.353 --> 02:33.754
fighting the system

02:33.821 --> 02:35.789
or trapped in some
bureaucratic quagmire.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.558
Am I right?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.260
Yeah, you're pretty right.

02:39.327 --> 02:42.496
Here, no bureaucracy,
no broken system.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.997
Just the best care
we can provide

02:44.064 --> 02:45.499
to every patient we treat.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.034
I mean, County's
a dinosaur.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.869
We'd love to have you
come join our team

02:48.936 --> 02:50.304
out here in the 21st century.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.840
Is that something you
might be interested in?

02:52.906 --> 02:55.142
Yes, definitely.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.644
Usual wound dressing.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.347
Excellent work,
Nurse Taggart.

03:00.748 --> 03:04.184
So, when are you getting
your next break?

03:04.252 --> 03:07.187
Again? Wow!

03:07.255 --> 03:09.823
Uh, I'll come meet you
in a half hour.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.425
Okay.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.894
Hey, Frank, can you get me
a V/Q scan for Exam 2?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.763
Do I not look busy to you?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.532
What, you finally
figured out how to beat
the computer at solitaire?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.234
Hey, if you have to know,

03:20.301 --> 03:22.069
I'm adjusting the patient
throughput database.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.471
(Taggart yelps)

03:23.537 --> 03:25.373
Always ask your nurse
for preemptive orders.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.575
That way you won't have
to wait for an attending.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.310
Thank you so much, Chuny.
You're welcome.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.379
Frank, do you have
the PowerPoint CD and the notes

03:31.445 --> 03:32.946
for the joint trauma
conference today?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.682
Check and check.
Get the hell away
from me, woman!

03:34.748 --> 03:36.450
Come on now!
Just put the gown on!

03:36.517 --> 03:38.452
Hey!
Mr. Randall!
Mr. Randall!

03:38.519 --> 03:40.554
You owe me five bucks!

03:40.621 --> 03:42.890
We're presenting
at the trauma conference?

03:42.956 --> 03:44.692
Yeah, hemostatic resuscitation.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.694
Sounds boring.
Chuny, did I do this right?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.228
G'day, all.
I'd like to introduce

03:48.296 --> 03:50.030
new fourth year, Kaya Montoya.
Hi.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.599
Hi, I'm Sam.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.867
Hi, I'm Chuny.
BRENNER:
Kaya comes to us

03:53.934 --> 03:55.703
all the way from the
University of New Mexico.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.538
Be gentle.
It's her first day.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.872
You're a Lobo, huh?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.007
I sure am.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.375
I'm a big fan.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.776
Spent a lot of time
there as a kid.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.312
Used to go to football games
with my brother.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.747
My dad has
season tickets.
Oh.

04:06.814 --> 04:10.017
Hi. What time
did you leave?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.286
I must have
fallen asleep.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.721
Red wine...

04:13.787 --> 04:16.089
Dr. Montoya,
care to assist me

04:16.156 --> 04:17.425
on a corneal foreign body?

04:17.491 --> 04:18.559
DAWN:
Mr. Randall...

04:18.625 --> 04:19.927
RANDALL:
No means no!

04:19.993 --> 04:24.164
No!

04:24.231 --> 04:27.635
What, you couldn't
wait a half hour?

04:36.910 --> 04:39.012
BP: 175/100.
Oh, I know my pressure's high.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.414
I ran out of my pills.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.882
Yeah, for the third time.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.284
The ER is not the place
to come for med refills.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.986
(sneezes)
Bless you.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.154
Oh, God bless you.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.523
My doctor died five years ago

04:49.590 --> 04:51.759
and I haven't found
another one I like.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.894
Well, I'll refer you
to County Clinic.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.729
Oh, six months' wait.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.698
Don't know if you noticed,
sweet cakes,

04:57.765 --> 05:01.168
but time ain't
exactly on my side.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.404
Shh, shh!
Oh, it's okay, Purdy.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.440
Come on. Come on.
It's okay. It's okay.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.475
(gasps)
Hey, you are not supposed

05:07.541 --> 05:08.909
to have that in here.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.012
Oh, she's just a baby.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.947
You know what?

05:14.014 --> 05:15.816
I'm going to give you
a two-week supply of meds.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.017
No refills.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.519
I want you to get
a regular doctor.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.953
DAWN:
Abby, got a couple of rigs

05:20.020 --> 05:21.555
coming in.
Brenner told me to get you.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.823
You qualify for Medicare.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.124
We'll help you
find somebody.

05:24.191 --> 05:27.160
Won't find anyone I like.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.530
Will you make sure
Social Work gets down here?

05:30.564 --> 05:33.601
(Abby sneezes)
Bless you.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.438
Who has 27 cats?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.407
That's disgusting.
I hate cats.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.974
Did I mention that?

05:41.041 --> 05:43.110
So what's up, girl?
How you doing?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.244
I'm fine.
This'll go away.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.679
No, I mean with you.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.581
Something's on your mind.
I can tell.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.985
No, not more
than usual really.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.888
Is it Luka?
No.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.457
Well, yeah.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.559
But it's not just that.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.861
I got a job offer.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.129
What? Where?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.363
Payton Medical Center.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.565
Ooh, fancy.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.234
Don't you go and get
all stuck up on us.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.602
It is nice.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.303
Bet the pay is nice, too.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.706
The pay is good.
The hours are good.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.007
They use a portion
of their profits

06:14.074 --> 06:16.243
to provide free care
to the uninsured.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.978
It's all good.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.480
Wow, look at you, girl.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.949
I remember back when
we were nurses together.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.252
Now you're about to go off
and be an attending.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.554
I'm happy for you.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.656
Proud, too.
Thanks, Chuny.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.190
Abby, glad you could join us.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.959
I got here as soon as I could.
Of course you did.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.827
She says her name is Lois.
She was staggering

06:33.894 --> 06:35.328
in a crosswalk
before she passed out.
Lois Landry.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.664
Is she drunk?
Nothing on the breath.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.499
No apparent head trauma.
Lois Lan...

06:38.566 --> 06:40.768
150/90. Normal sinus at 62.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.335
You've been
partying, Lois?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.437
(wearily):
No.
We got this one.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.638
BRENNER:
What do you got?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.239
Manny Bonilla,
mail truck driver,

06:46.306 --> 06:47.908
swerved to avoid the lady.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.679
You're going to want
four units of O neg,

06:51.745 --> 06:53.747
a surgery consult,
auto versus pole,

06:53.814 --> 06:55.683
abdominal and pelvic trauma.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.118
All right. On my count.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.621
One, two, three.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.056
Hi, I'm Dr. Morris.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.525
Manny.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.828
Uh, trauma panel, C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

07:07.895 --> 07:08.996
UA and 12 lead?

07:09.062 --> 07:09.997
Uh, yeah.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.331
Can't believe this.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.101
One second I'm driving along,
minding my business,

07:14.167 --> 07:16.436
and there she is.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.105
Right in the middle
of the street.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.106
I got the hemocue.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.608
Scleral icterus.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.975
Bradying to 55.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.611
Slow heart rate.
Is that why she fainted?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.045
No, her BP's fine.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.615
CBC, chem panel,
type and hold, coags,

07:27.681 --> 07:29.016
and have Frank
go through her stuff,

07:29.082 --> 07:30.884
see if there's
any family to contact.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.953
BRENNER:
Kaya, do you appreciate
the jaundice?
No.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.655
Hemocue 11.2.
How do we put it all together,
altered and jaundiced?

07:34.722 --> 07:36.857
Maybe she has...
I didn't ask you, Laverne.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.325
Do us a favor.
Put the patient in a gown.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.426
Is it a head bleed?

07:39.493 --> 07:40.594
No, there's no sign of trauma,

07:40.661 --> 07:42.195
but we do have asterixis.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.396
Now jaundice means
liver disease,

07:43.463 --> 07:44.732
so what lab's
going to help us?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.366
AST?
I can do it myself.
No.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.602
ALT?
It's ammonia.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.437
That's right,
so she may have...?

07:50.504 --> 07:51.805
Hepatic encephalopathy

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
from acute
liver failure?
Very good.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.875
45cc's of oral lactulose.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.276
BRENNER:
You're quite the teacher.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.578
Yeah, you should
try it sometime.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.847
Oh, I teach.
I'm just very selective.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.887
Distal aorta's closed. Clamp.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.723
EBL 250cc's. Pressure's good.
(phone ringing)

08:09.790 --> 08:10.958
DUBENKO:
It's not pretty.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.459
RASGOTRA:
How did this happen?

08:12.526 --> 08:13.527
It's just one of those things.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.662
SHIRLEY:
OR 2.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.796
Send this for cultures, please.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.230
ICU's got a post-op

08:17.297 --> 08:18.766
heart bleeding out
through the chest tube.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.233
Okay. Tell them
I'll be right there.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.802
You'll what?
SHIRLEY:
He'll be right there.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.370
Yep, finish up.
The hard stuff's done.

08:23.436 --> 08:24.672
Lucien...
Make sure
to keep the heparin

08:24.738 --> 08:26.006
at 18 cc's per kilo per hour

08:26.073 --> 08:27.775
and check coags q4.
You'll be fine.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.547
(groans):
Okay.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.548
Hip's back in.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.116
Pressure's up to 130/82.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.518
Have Surgery meet him at the CT
to review the scan.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.822
Dr. Morris, I need to go up
to Psych for my debriefing.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.624
Total waste of time.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.392
I don't know why
they're making it mandatory.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.727
Shoot, I don't mind.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.228
That man could've
killed us all.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.897
You know, these people
out here are crazy.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.266
Your liver is, uh...

08:53.333 --> 08:54.501
is pretty damaged, Lois.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.937
BRENNER:
Have you had a fever?

08:57.004 --> 08:59.239
Just weak and achy
for a few weeks.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.741
Thought it was the flu.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.976
Okay, everybody goes
right to hep A and B,

09:03.043 --> 09:04.778
but you should consider
other infectious etiologies...

09:04.845 --> 09:08.515
Mm-hmm, like CMV, HSV,
paramyxovirus,

09:08.582 --> 09:09.750
hemorrhagic fever.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.118
We'll send serologies.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.320
Are you on any
prescription medication?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.122
BRENNER:
What kinds were you
thinking about?

09:15.188 --> 09:16.890
Certain antibiotics.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.026
Antivirals,
antidepressants,

09:19.092 --> 09:22.630
oral hypoglycemics,
seizure meds, and NSAIDs.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.534
I gave grand rounds on fulminant
hepatic failure last year.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.002
Grand rounds.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.071
Well, I guess I don't have
anything to teach you.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.339
I guess you don't.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.107
How long am I going to be here?
I work tonight.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
Uh... actually, I think
you're probably going

09:36.243 --> 09:38.078
to have to stay in the hospital
for a little while, Lois.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.213
We went ahead
and contacted your family.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.383
You what?

09:43.450 --> 09:44.618
We found your wallet.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.819
Our clerk was able
to get in touch

09:45.886 --> 09:47.554
with your mom
and she's on her way.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.922
Oh, my God.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.357
Don't worry.
We'll figure this out.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.760
You had no right
to go through my things.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.194
I don't want anyone here.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.497
Well, you're pretty sick and...
I'm fine

09:57.564 --> 09:58.866
on my own; I don't...

09:58.932 --> 10:01.134
I don't need any help.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.637
Everybody needs some help
sometimes.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.606
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.008
More saline
at the splenic flexure.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.476
She's got some
interloop abscesses.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.211
Fourth liter's up.
Oh, crap.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
I think the bowel's perfed.
Page Dubenko.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.481
You nick it
removing the graft?

10:14.547 --> 10:15.849
No, the injury's
old and ratty.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.450
Maybe we missed it.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.852
You page Lucien yet?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.487
Yeah. What do you want to do?

10:20.553 --> 10:22.222
GIA stapler?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.158
Lesion's less than
30% of the lumen.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.161
Better off with debridement
and primary closure.

10:28.228 --> 10:31.699
Okay, 15 blade, pickups
and 3-oh vicryl. Let's go.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.535
I'm keeping my hand
in the midline.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.270
Now, elicit a fluid wave.

10:37.337 --> 10:41.008
Laverne, would you mind calling
the lab for our results, please?

10:43.376 --> 10:47.414
After that, I'll show you how
to check for urine bilinogen.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.451
So Lois, you said you first
got sick a few weeks ago?

10:51.518 --> 10:52.652
Mm.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.555
You live with somebody?

10:55.622 --> 10:57.390
Alone.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.993
I left home a long time ago.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.930
FRANK:
Abby, I've got
the mother here.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.231
Hi. Uh, I'm
Dr. Lockhart.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.199
Lois passed out
on the crosswalk.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.600
We think that

11:07.667 --> 11:09.202
she's having some problems
with her liver.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.670
Lois? Who is Lois?

11:10.738 --> 11:14.241
Where-Where is my son?

11:14.307 --> 11:16.309
I'm sorry?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.778
I'm Edith Landry.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.213
They said
you had my son, Lonnie.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.216
I'm right here, Mom.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.697
CLETUS:
Let's get pizza for lunch.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.733
No, no, let's...
let's get some beefs.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.668
You guys like
sweet peppers or hot?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.036
Both.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.704
Me, too.
And dipped twice.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.373
Shut up.
You're making me hungry.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.576
I haven't had normal food
in days.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.144
You got a little fever.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.079
(sighs)

11:52.145 --> 11:53.680
I've had a fever for weeks.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.982
I'm not worried.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.050
Good. We'll check back
in a bit, okay?

11:59.719 --> 12:00.788
Why is she still spiking?

12:00.854 --> 12:02.222
Well, it's to be expected,

12:02.289 --> 12:03.590
especially when you've
manipulated infected tissue.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.792
Fever, shifting
vital signs--

12:04.858 --> 12:06.426
all part of the
healing process.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.962
I should have done a resection
and an anastomosis instead.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.831
No. Primary repair
was the right thing.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.299
You know, maybe
my sutures were too loose.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.134
She could be leaking
into her...
Stop it.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.803
I've watched you
do primary repair

12:15.869 --> 12:17.537
of a bowel perf
probably a hundred times.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.807
But I just can't
be positive that...
Neela!

12:19.873 --> 12:23.176
You stepped up.
You made the right calls.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.513
(voice breaking):
I told you
I didn't want anyone here.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.317
(sighs)

12:32.285 --> 12:34.354
She's upset.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.527
(sighs)

12:41.461 --> 12:43.763
You know, sometimes...

12:46.066 --> 12:47.334
...the people closest
are the ones

12:47.400 --> 12:49.937
that have the hardest time
with the truth.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.907
(sniffles)

12:58.145 --> 13:00.914
I'll be right back.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.883
EDITH:
No, I'm fine.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.384
D-Don't worry.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.154
We'll talk about it
when I get home, okay?

13:07.220 --> 13:10.257
Okay. Bye.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.161
That was my husband.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.497
I lied to him.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.399
He doesn't know that...

13:19.466 --> 13:21.568
Lonnie is here.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.772
Um, we're not sure yet,

13:25.839 --> 13:27.841
but I think her
liver is failing.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.076
Her?

13:29.142 --> 13:32.712
I know. It's a lot. I know.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.148
When you people called me,

13:35.215 --> 13:37.184
you said my son was here.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.820
There was a driver's license
in the personal belongings bag.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.856
Our clerk used it
to contact you.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.292
We-We had no idea.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.869
Lonnie always had a flair
for the dramatic.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.973
We woke up one morning
six years ago,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.310
and he was just gone.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.779
My strange, sweet little boy.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.016
Just gone.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.584
He never had many friends,
you know.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.653
Kept to himself.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.625
His father-- they, uh...
they never saw eye to eye.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.765
Um....

14:25.832 --> 14:28.201
I may have to go
check on some of L...

14:28.268 --> 14:31.404
uh, of Lonnie's... tests,

14:31.471 --> 14:33.673
but you can go in there
if you like.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.008
I'm-I'm sure...

14:35.075 --> 14:39.179
your child could
use the company.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.219
PRATT:
What are you guys doing?

14:46.286 --> 14:47.921
I don't see
anything.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.356
Watching surveillance
footage.
Right there.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.124
Charlie and his crew
caught some couple

14:51.191 --> 14:52.725
knockin' boots
all over the hospital.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.427
MORRIS:
I've seen more
steam in a shower.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.795
You don't see
the gyrating?

14:55.862 --> 14:56.964
Look at the
gyrating.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.698
Is that
a leg?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.267
Yup. Well, we
still got to get
the picture enhanced,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.002
bring up the
sound levels.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.503
You got cameras wired
for sound?
Some.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.205
Ah.
What a tease.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.407
Hey, Morris,
you need to sign off

15:07.474 --> 15:08.508
on my CHF'er.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.443
What are you guys
looking at?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.945
Surveillance
footage.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.246
Of what?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.614
Apparently, people
getting busy

15:14.681 --> 15:15.983
all over the hospital.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.350
What?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.086
No idea
who they are, huh?
Uh-uh.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.188
Well, hang on to the DVD.
Look again.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.522
See if you recognize anyone.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.224
Will do.
Yeah.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.993
FRANK:
That look
like sex to you?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.127
TAGGART:
Yeah.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.261
I mean, n-no.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.097
Yeah, not
good sex anyway.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.299
Hey, Morris, I got to go
to Psych to do my debriefing.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.766
Did you do
yours yet?

15:33.833 --> 15:34.968
Yeah. It was lame.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.337
Hey, Gates,
uh, come here a sec.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.471
What?

15:38.538 --> 15:40.007
(laughing):
It's surveillance footage

15:40.073 --> 15:42.675
of people having sex
in different rooms

15:42.742 --> 15:43.977
in the hospital.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.578
I know it's
been a long time,

15:45.645 --> 15:48.648
but that does not
look like sex to me.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.819
Frank, I've been waiting
forever on the LFTs.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.055
Could you check
on that for me?
Yeah. Sure.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.956
(Pratt sighs)
Hey, do you
have a minute?

15:57.024 --> 15:58.258
Yeah. Come on.
Walk with me.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.692
What's going on
with the attending job?

15:59.759 --> 16:01.094
You still haven't
heard anything yet?

16:01.161 --> 16:02.429
You know how
slow they are.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.164
I got another
job offer.
What? Where?

16:04.231 --> 16:05.532
Payton Medical Center,
and they want an answer today.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.300
Well, can't you get them
to wait another day?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.369
I'll go talk to Anspaugh
as soon as I can.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.171
They've been waiting
for two weeks.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.173
Just get 'em to wait
one more day.
You're the one

16:13.240 --> 16:15.242
that told me to get
out there, so I did.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.877
I need a plan, or I'm gonna
end up working in Lubbock.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.446
Abby, got Lois' labs back.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.448
They put 'em in the system
under the wrong name.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.083
Bilirubin's eight.
AST: 10,000.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.518
Look, I'll get an answer
as soon as I can.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.192
Mrs. Landry, I got
the test results.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.565
That's him.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.734
Abby, just got
the coags.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.103
Protime is 96.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.571
Okay, hang the FFP.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.738
What's happening?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.074
We need to give plasma

16:47.140 --> 16:48.275
because her damaged liver
is not making

16:48.341 --> 16:49.542
enough proteins
to clot the blood.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.544
I need to go talk
to her about this.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.381
I think you should come.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.419
Last hemocue was 11.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.821
Okay, stay ahead
four of packed cells.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.790
Hi, Mom.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.160
It's just me.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.162
Don't worry. Your father

17:09.229 --> 17:12.398
isn't coming.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.867
It's been so long.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.869
You didn't call

17:17.936 --> 17:19.872
or even write.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.741
I didn't know what to say.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.344
We didn't know where you were,

17:24.411 --> 17:27.180
if you were even... alive.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.916
Six years.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.119
(sniffles)

17:32.185 --> 17:34.087
I'm sorry.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.089
(sobbing):
Please don't hate me.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.958
(sniffles)

17:39.025 --> 17:40.227
Honey...
(sobs)

17:40.293 --> 17:43.863
Honey, I could never hate you.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.533
(whimpering)

17:48.101 --> 17:50.903
Uh, Lois... Lois?

17:50.970 --> 17:54.407
Your test results show
that you're in liver failure.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.076
Do you take
hormones?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.478
(gasps)

17:58.545 --> 18:01.114
Uh, estrogen injections
twice a week.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.949
LOCKHART:
Where do you get them?

18:03.015 --> 18:04.617
From a friend
of a friend.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.219
A doctor?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.955
It's this guy who brings them
back from Mexico.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.391
They're... They're way cheaper.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.326
I'm just...
I'm trying to save money.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.962
It's okay. Is there a way
we can get a sample?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.364
Do you have
any at home?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.032
Um... I have a vial
in my purse.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.701
I had it with me.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.969
(sniffles)

18:23.035 --> 18:26.239
It's right here.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.142
(mumbles)

18:29.209 --> 18:31.043
I'm sorry. I know
they're in here.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.179
It's okay.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.946
There.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.682
Can you get that
to toxicology?

18:35.748 --> 18:37.184
Yeah.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.854
You think it's the estrogen?

18:41.921 --> 18:43.623
We'll find out.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.927
Have you had
the reassignment surgery yet?

18:47.994 --> 18:50.163
(sniffles)

18:50.230 --> 18:51.864
No. That's what
I'm saving up for.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.367
CHUNY:
Hey, Abby, can you wait
till next Wednesday?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.336
They only do gas chromatography
once a week.

18:56.403 --> 18:57.537
LOCKHART:
Since when?

18:57.604 --> 19:00.072
CHUNY:
Since budget cuts.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.441
I love County.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.075
What do you mean
you didn't get it?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.544
What do you mean
what do I mean?

19:04.611 --> 19:06.246
Do I have to get
it myself?
No, I'll get it.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.181
Okay, well, it's right
there on the desk.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.849
Aren't you the
cutest thing?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.451
Yay!
(laughs)
Oh!

19:11.518 --> 19:12.952
MORRIS:
You going soft on me, Frank?

19:13.019 --> 19:14.887
FRANK:
Well, look at
the face. Oh!

19:14.954 --> 19:16.356
Not doing it for me.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.824
Let me see.
Let me see.
Here...

19:17.890 --> 19:19.626
No, that's...
(clattering on floor)

19:19.692 --> 19:21.461
Hey, Gates, what the hell's
the matter with you?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.129
I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.397
I'll get it.
I'll get it. No.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.798
I've got it. Scram.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.801
You've done enough.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.738
Dr. Gates, broken arm kid
is ready to go.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.072
All right.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.775
(gasps):
Oh, my God, look how cute.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.009
Her name is Purdy.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.345
(laughs)

19:38.411 --> 19:40.413
Ms. Gaines,
what are you doing here?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.349
Uh, stretching
my legs.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.317
Well, you left me
back there for... forever.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.986
You know, I wrote the discharge
at 10:00 a.m.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.455
Here's the prescription.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.022
What does it take
to send somebody home?

19:50.089 --> 19:51.324
Forget where
you work?

19:51.391 --> 19:52.725
Would you mind?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.026
Right this way, ma'am.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.862
Thank you, Miss.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.231
Messenger from Payton picked up
your toxicology sample.
Okay.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.699
Abby, Lois is vomiting blood.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.700
Suction's on high.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.335
Push the packed cells.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.103
What's happening?

20:04.170 --> 20:05.938
She's bleeding from either
her esophagus or her stomach.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.139
She's had FFP?
Two units.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.541
Okay, well, call GI.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.776
We're gonna heat coagulate
with an endoscope.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.344
All right,
hold on, hold on.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.745
Hold on. Let's use
Recombinant factor 8-A.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.281
I don't know.
It's a brand-new drug.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.615
It can normalize

20:15.682 --> 20:17.717
the PT in 20 minutes
if the FFP fails.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.387
Okay, Grand Rounds,
your show.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.154
Four migs
per kig IV push.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.090
Okay.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.426
Sensitivities on
Sheryl Hawkins.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.329
Cultures came back positive
for Acinetobacter.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.764
Resistant to vanco, imipenem,
linezolid, everything.

20:31.831 --> 20:32.932
What are you doing?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.501
Calling ID.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.336
There must be another drug.
Something that will...

20:36.403 --> 20:37.670
No, Neela, there's not.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.306
She is septic.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.741
If we can't treat this,
we're gonna lose her.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.009
I understand that.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.511
Then why are you not upset?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.045
Well, who says that I'm not?

20:46.112 --> 20:47.580
I simply don't feel the need
to indulge it.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.115
So what do you suggest
I do then?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.850
I suggest you take a deep
breath, gather yourself

20:50.917 --> 20:54.086
and go back in there and
find out how aggressive

20:54.153 --> 20:56.523
she wants us to be.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.592
(chart thudding)

21:04.331 --> 21:05.632
Hey, there.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.866
Hey.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.301
How you feeling?

21:08.368 --> 21:10.036
Same.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.238
Uh, Is and Os
look good.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.273
How's the PCA working out?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.708
You in any pain?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.377
No.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.879
Should that have changed?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.614
Not necessarily.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.783
You already did
your rounds.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.685
Why are you back?

21:25.752 --> 21:27.620
I've been here
a month.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.622
You never
just check in.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.325
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.895
Neela...

21:35.962 --> 21:39.265
I'm a mother of four.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.568
Do you really think I don't know

21:41.634 --> 21:43.903
when someone's not
telling the truth?

21:46.906 --> 21:49.041
Where's your family?

21:51.043 --> 21:53.413
Getting lunch.

21:53.480 --> 21:57.016
Well, you should get them back.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.525
NG output has
slowed down.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.059
Looks like
your factor 8-A worked.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.061
Repeat CBC and coags.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.063
Abby,
this is Mr. Landry.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.699
And a Dr. Jensen called.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.401
Said he'd try your cell.
Mike?

22:14.467 --> 22:16.035
MIKE:
Edith?
I told you
not to come.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.804
Hemoglobin's 10.
You said you were
at the hospital.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.138
I thought
you got hurt.
It's okay.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.740
Keep her NPO.
I'm fine.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.174
D5 half at
125 an hour.
What's going on here?

22:22.241 --> 22:23.676
If you're okay,
what are you doing?

22:23.743 --> 22:25.945
Mr. Landry, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
And maybe

22:26.012 --> 22:28.448
you two might want
to talk about this
outside, okay?

22:28.515 --> 22:29.582
Chuny, can you show them
to the Family Room?

22:29.649 --> 22:30.983
MARQUEZ:
Sure thing.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.452
Want to follow me
this way, please.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.554
Okay, check a KUB
for NG placement.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.355
Well, this case just got
a lot more interesting,

22:36.423 --> 22:37.757
didn't it?
You got this?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.926
Absolutely.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.328
Hi.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.030
Dr. Jensen. Hi.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.365
Listen, I really appreciate
you running that for me.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.968
Our lab is... it's a mess.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.302
You know.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.571
Yeah, about that.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.339
I need to ask you for a favor.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.341
Um, yeah.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.209
I was hoping

22:57.276 --> 23:00.547
that you'd give me one more day
to make a decision.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.248
Yeah, I know. I know.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.750
I... I...

23:03.816 --> 23:05.918
Right now?

23:06.686 --> 23:08.154
No, you're right.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.456
You're right. I... yeah.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.824
Um...

23:13.526 --> 23:15.462
I accept.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.464
Yeah.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.500
I'll take the job.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.535
Sat's only 77 on 100%.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.003
Lungs are wet.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.639
Send a blood gas
and get her on a non-rebreather.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.544
Translation, please.

23:31.611 --> 23:35.281
The infection is
causing fluid

23:35.347 --> 23:37.650
to collect
in your lungs.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.320
So, what now?

23:41.387 --> 23:43.355
Without
a breathing tube,

23:43.422 --> 23:45.324
your oxygen will
continue to drop

23:45.391 --> 23:46.693
and you'll...

23:46.759 --> 23:51.097
eventually fall
into a comatose state.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.705
Get the tube.

24:00.406 --> 24:02.709
Okay, then.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.746
Give me the tube.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.786
You don't think
it's a good idea?

24:13.853 --> 24:16.589
You won't be able to talk.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.592
(breathing laboredly)

24:19.659 --> 24:22.461
You got a point there.

24:22.529 --> 24:25.532
Sheryl,

24:25.598 --> 24:28.835
if we put this tube in,
we may never get it out.

24:28.901 --> 24:33.840
So I shouldn't even try
to get better?

24:33.906 --> 24:35.842
It's not a matter of trying.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.511
The antibiotics aren't working.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.881
Maybe my immune system

24:41.948 --> 24:44.250
can fight infection
on its own.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.218
It would take a miracle.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.725
I believe in those.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.697
I need to be sure

24:57.764 --> 25:01.033
you understand exactly
what I'm saying.

25:03.135 --> 25:06.072
If I don't try...

25:06.138 --> 25:09.208
what does that say?

25:11.277 --> 25:13.780
That's what I teach
my kids?

25:14.547 --> 25:17.550
(breathing laboredly)

25:21.353 --> 25:23.723
Put the bed...

25:23.790 --> 25:25.491
Can you put the bed up?

25:25.558 --> 25:27.493
(bed whirring)

25:27.560 --> 25:28.928
I want you to be

25:28.995 --> 25:30.096
in my blog.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.731
You can't say no.

25:31.798 --> 25:34.033
Can't say no.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.235
Chrissy.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.236
Okay.

25:37.303 --> 25:40.239
(panting):
Hi.

25:40.306 --> 25:43.242
Hi, everyone.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.510
(wheezing):
This...

25:44.577 --> 25:47.513
is the beautiful

25:47.580 --> 25:49.515
and talented

25:49.582 --> 25:53.385
Dr. Neela Rasgotra.

25:53.452 --> 25:54.887
She's the one

25:54.954 --> 25:58.090
always avoiding
the camera.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.226
(chuckles)

26:02.328 --> 26:04.597
She saved my life.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.966
Don't you say that!

26:07.033 --> 26:08.400
What the hell am I
supposed to say, Edie?!

26:08.467 --> 26:09.802
Huh?!
Excuse me.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.738
We got the toxicology
results back.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.139
It's not great news.

26:21.648 --> 26:25.484
Okay.

26:25.551 --> 26:28.487
The estrogen you've been
injecting contains

26:28.554 --> 26:30.122
tetrachloroethane.

26:30.189 --> 26:33.092
It's an organic solvent
extremely toxic to the liver.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.594
How can we fix it?

26:35.662 --> 26:37.363
The medicine I gave

26:37.429 --> 26:39.365
is only a
temporary fix.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.034
It's okay to look at me, Dad.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.976
Lois...

26:50.042 --> 26:52.311
(sobbing)

26:52.378 --> 26:54.647
Lois...

26:57.784 --> 27:01.654
I don't think your liver
can recover from the damage.

27:01.721 --> 27:05.624
We've already seen
bleeding complications,

27:05.692 --> 27:07.293
encephalopathy.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.029
If it's very serious,
it can cause seizures,

27:10.096 --> 27:12.999
a coma or death.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.736
So what do we do?

27:16.803 --> 27:19.138
Your best hope is
for a liver transplant.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.842
Transplant?

27:22.909 --> 27:24.744
How do we do that?

27:24.811 --> 27:26.245
There-there's some kind
of list, right?

27:26.312 --> 27:30.016
Yes, um, but that could
take a long time.

27:30.082 --> 27:33.385
There's something
called LDLT.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.722
If a family member
or friend is a tissue match,

27:35.788 --> 27:37.256
they can donate a portion
of their liver.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.759
Siblings have the highest odds
of being a match.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.794
We don't have
any other children.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.096
The odds are also good
for a parent.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.497
Yeah, we're not doing that.

27:45.564 --> 27:46.665
Let's go.
Mike...

27:46.733 --> 27:47.734
Damn it, Edith, no!

27:47.800 --> 27:48.735
We're leaving!

27:48.801 --> 27:51.337
(sobbing)

27:51.403 --> 27:53.372
Mr. Landry,

27:53.439 --> 27:54.741
please.
Please what?

27:54.807 --> 27:56.242
You're her only parents.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.443
You already lost her once...
How many times

27:57.509 --> 27:59.045
I gotta say no?

27:59.111 --> 28:00.612
Well, you're just gonna walk out
of here and let her die?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.681
I'll do it.
Edith!

28:04.717 --> 28:06.953
I'll do it.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.121
Test me.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.924
Frank...
Hmm?

28:11.991 --> 28:13.926
um, if you're
not too busy,

28:13.993 --> 28:15.928
could you help me
with something?

28:15.995 --> 28:18.264
Well, I need somebody
big and strong

28:18.330 --> 28:21.467
to help me put a box
on a shelf in Sutures.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.469
Okay, Sam.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.271
Chivalry's not dead.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.808
Oh, I have to forward
the phones.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.952
All right, and last
but not least,

28:40.019 --> 28:41.653
first trimester bleed,
ultrasound

28:41.720 --> 28:43.322
and quant beta
HCG pending.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.225
Hey, so I heard you made
the short list for chief.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.459
All right.

28:47.526 --> 28:48.895
When's your final
interview?
Next week.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.696
You ready?
You got your game face?

28:50.763 --> 28:52.031
Yeah, I'm good.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.499
So where you going
anyway?

28:53.565 --> 28:54.801
It's personal, Morris.

28:54.867 --> 28:55.968
Oh, okay,

28:56.035 --> 28:57.136
international
man of mystery.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.305
All right,
it's Betina.

28:59.371 --> 29:00.807
She needs a few things
and it can't wait
till my shift's over.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.108
Post-op things.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.442
Cupcakes worked,
didn't they?

29:03.509 --> 29:04.977
It's cool.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.512
You don't have to give me
credit. My advice worked.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.679
I know you know.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.015
And I know
you know I know.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.482
Hey, Pratt.
Hey.

29:10.549 --> 29:11.683
Did you talk to Anspaugh?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.052
I haven't had a
chance yet. Why?

29:13.119 --> 29:14.320
'Cause I took
the other job.
What?!

29:14.386 --> 29:16.088
Why would you do that?

29:16.155 --> 29:17.523
Because they wouldn't
give me another day.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.858
And it's a really good job.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.692
All right, look,
I got to go,

29:20.759 --> 29:24.063
but when I get back,
we're going to fix this.

29:24.130 --> 29:27.666
Okay, everyone,
let's get started.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.168
The five-year war in Iraq

29:29.235 --> 29:31.137
hasn't yielded
any weapons of mass destruction,

29:31.203 --> 29:32.839
but it has given us
some advances

29:32.905 --> 29:35.574
in trauma resuscitation.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.776
Hemostatic resuscitation

29:37.844 --> 29:39.745
is about replacing
coagulation factors

29:39.812 --> 29:41.413
and platelets early.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.783
So, soldiers who received plasma
on a one-to-one ratio

29:44.851 --> 29:48.454
with PRBC transfusion
have lower mortality.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.057
Lights, please.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.327
TAGGART:
Ooh, you're such a tiger.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.795
(Gates roaring)
(Taggart moaning)

29:56.863 --> 29:58.064
GATES:
What'd you call me?

29:58.130 --> 29:59.431
TAGGART:
I called you a tiger.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.632
GATES:
Say it louder.
Yeah.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.001
Tiger!
What?

30:02.068 --> 30:03.735
Yes!
That's my kind
of presentation.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.037
Ooh!
That's the tiger...

30:05.104 --> 30:07.506
That's right.
Ooh, come to Mama.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.008
Hey.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.609
Hi.
I got everything.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.278
Drainable pouches,

30:12.344 --> 30:14.480
no-sting prep wipe,
stomahesive powder.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.282
You romantic fool.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.284
So, you need anything?
I got to get back.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.519
Um, more water?
Sure.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.126
There you go.
Oh, with ice, please.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.395
Sure. No problem.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.796
Is there anything else
I can get you?

30:30.863 --> 30:33.265
Kiss, please.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.305
So, I was thinking...

30:39.371 --> 30:41.773
I should stay here
for a few days.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.375
Why?

30:43.442 --> 30:45.044
Look, we both know

30:45.111 --> 30:47.546
that you shouldn't
be alone right now.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.581
I can sleep here
on the couch,

30:49.648 --> 30:52.218
and tend
to your every need.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.421
And not because
I'm supposed to,

30:55.487 --> 30:57.256
but because I want to.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.557
Get it?

30:58.624 --> 31:00.226
Got it.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.894
Good.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.463
Come here.

31:06.432 --> 31:07.934
Mmm.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.637
I missed you, Mama.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.973
I missed you, too.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.044
Mrs. Landry,

31:18.110 --> 31:19.445
we got your lab results back.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.613
And they show that
you are a tissue match.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.949
Oh, thank God.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.416
How soon can we do it?
We can't.

31:24.483 --> 31:27.419
The tests also show
that you have cirrhosis.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.757
I used to be a drinker,

31:31.823 --> 31:34.560
but I thought I was okay.
I haven't been sick.

31:34.626 --> 31:35.827
You are okay now,

31:35.894 --> 31:37.396
but it's too risky
for you to donate.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.397
Mr. Landry...

31:38.464 --> 31:39.265
Don't even say it.

31:39.331 --> 31:39.966
Mike.

31:40.032 --> 31:40.866
V tach. No pulse.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.334
She's still ours!

31:42.401 --> 31:43.502
Charge to 300!

31:44.536 --> 31:45.938
That is not my kid!

31:46.005 --> 31:47.273
Clear! Clear!
I don't know

31:47.339 --> 31:49.108
who that is!

31:49.175 --> 31:51.143
MARQUEZ:
No change.
Mike!
360.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.644
Standby with epi and
lidocaine. Okay, clear.
Don't you walk out of here!

31:52.711 --> 31:54.646
She's still ours, Mike!

31:54.713 --> 31:56.482
Pulseless V tach.

31:56.548 --> 31:57.716
All right.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.351
Continue compressions,
intubation,

31:59.418 --> 32:01.687
get 8.0 ET tube and suction.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.427
Chuny, what was
her last creatinine?

32:08.494 --> 32:11.130
MARQUEZ:
2.9.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.731
All right,
push an amp of calcium.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.566
That's not in the
algorithm for...
Just push it.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.835
MARQUEZ:
It's not in the crash cart.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.637
What are you thinking--
hyperkalemia?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.372
EDITH:
Hyper what?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.940
MARQUEZ:
Abby.
LOCKHART:
Too much potassium.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.575
I thought you said
it was her heart.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.944
She's had six units of blood;
that's a huge potassium load.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.047
And if she's in
hepatorenal syndrome...

32:28.114 --> 32:29.848
Her kidneys can't clear it
and her heart will stop.

32:29.915 --> 32:31.350
(gasping):
Oh, God.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.385
Calcium's in.
All right,
hold compressions.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.457
Got a pulse.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.692
Nice work, Abby.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.429
Amp of D50, amp of bicarb,
ten units of insulin.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.796
Pressure at 100/60.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.532
(gasping):
Oh, thank God.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.766
Oh, thank you.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.668
Great work, guys.

32:49.735 --> 32:54.040
LOCKHART:
All right, send out a
chem panel and call renal.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.380
(sobbing)

33:01.447 --> 33:03.415
Uh... he's okay now, right?

33:03.482 --> 33:05.351
Lois is in
critical condition.

33:05.417 --> 33:09.055
She's going to keep arresting or
die until she gets a new liver.

33:16.962 --> 33:18.930
Hey, what's up, man?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.332
What are you doing
out here?

33:20.399 --> 33:22.868
Oh, it's slow.
Just taking a breather.

33:22.934 --> 33:25.804
So how'd that trauma
conference go?

33:25.871 --> 33:29.941
(chuckles)
Oh, probably the
best one ever.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.910
Really?
Oh, yeah.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.879
Mm.
Wow.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.347
How's Betina?

33:35.414 --> 33:39.285
Ah, she's a little sore,
but she'll be all right.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.987
You did the right thing
going back to her.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.322
Well, actually, it's weird.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.657
You know, I've never felt
like this before.

33:45.724 --> 33:49.295
I used to think that falling
in love was like...

33:49.361 --> 33:50.962
getting sick or something.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.531
(chuckling):
So you try to avoid it, right?

33:52.598 --> 33:56.468
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.938
You know,
I was thinking about, uh,

34:00.005 --> 34:02.741
that thing
that happened to you.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.511
You know,
that hostage thing?

34:05.577 --> 34:06.812
Oh, yeah?

34:06.878 --> 34:09.380
Yeah, well, you know
how those things like that go.

34:09.447 --> 34:13.452
I mean, you keep thinking about
'em even when you don't want to.

34:13.518 --> 34:17.556
So... if you want
to talk, man,

34:17.623 --> 34:19.958
it's cool with me.

34:20.025 --> 34:21.827
What, what is there
to talk about?

34:21.893 --> 34:23.829
I don't know.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.264
It's just sometimes it helps.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.466
I know I've had to do it.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.936
So, if... you want,
you could talk to me

34:31.002 --> 34:33.938
or somebody
more qualified.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.141
There's no shame
in that.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.576
(sighing):
You know, I-I already did

34:37.643 --> 34:40.246
their mandatory
little psych debrief.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.246
I don't need it.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.880
I'm... I'm good.

34:42.947 --> 34:46.083
All right, cool.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.420
I'll see you inside.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.059
Oh, that's right,
tiger, yes, yes.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.360
(laughter)

34:55.427 --> 34:56.328
No way.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.663
We kid you not. It was great.

34:57.729 --> 34:58.897
Didn't know
you had it in you, Tony.

34:58.964 --> 34:59.765
Yeah, well,
now you do.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.133
You all do.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.135
Sorry, still doesn't look
like sex to me.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.571
Oh, my favorite part
was the linen cart.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.707
All right,
you know what?
Whoa!

35:09.808 --> 35:12.378
There, you got us.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.745
Gates is my boyfriend.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.080
Are you happy now?

35:15.147 --> 35:16.081
Show's over.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.983
Now go back to work.

35:18.049 --> 35:19.851
Yeah, what she said.

35:19.918 --> 35:21.119
(laughter)

35:21.187 --> 35:22.288
Hey, cover for
me, will you?

35:22.354 --> 35:23.655
I got to go see Uncle Donnie.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.723
Sure, mate, been
covering all day.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.091
Why stop now?

35:26.158 --> 35:28.160
Dr. Brenner,
we're ready to present.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.329
Ah, the dutiful,
young fourth-years.

35:30.396 --> 35:32.130
I'm all ears.
Present away.

35:32.198 --> 35:33.532
56-year-old woman
with a history...

35:33.599 --> 35:34.766
Let's start with
the chief complaint

35:34.833 --> 35:36.235
that brought her in.

35:36.302 --> 35:39.771
Okay, uh, chief complaint
is headache, backache,

35:39.838 --> 35:40.839
nausea, dizziness...

35:40.906 --> 35:42.308
That's four complaints,

35:42.374 --> 35:43.775
so go back and find what
the biggest problem is.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.678
Kaya, take a look
at the nosebleed in 2.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.013
We're going to
pack it together.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.014
Okay.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.148
Dr. Brenner.

35:50.216 --> 35:53.118
Yes?

35:53.185 --> 35:55.554
Why are you treating
me like this?

35:55.621 --> 35:58.156
Look at me.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.663
What the hell
was last night, huh?

36:04.730 --> 36:06.398
Boring.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.801
To be honest, dull,
mundane, mechanical.

36:09.868 --> 36:12.671
Thank God I had two bottles
of Bordeaux in me.

36:12.738 --> 36:13.972
You know,
I don't know why I thought

36:14.039 --> 36:15.040
that you'd be a better student

36:15.106 --> 36:16.542
in bed
than you are here,

36:16.608 --> 36:19.578
but I guess the Bordeaux
helped with that as well.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.248
You don't want
to see me, fine,

36:22.314 --> 36:23.782
but you still
have to teach me.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.517
Well, for that
to be possible, my dear,

36:25.584 --> 36:27.753
you would actually have
to have the ability to learn.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.256
I could get you
fired for this.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.790
Really?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.125
And risk sullying that
spotless reputation to become

36:34.192 --> 36:35.361
the student that sleeps
with attendings

36:35.427 --> 36:36.728
and then rats them out?

36:36.795 --> 36:39.531
That? That would be something,
wouldn't it?

36:40.299 --> 36:43.469
(sighs)

36:46.905 --> 36:49.808
You can fill out all the
admit papers up in the ICU.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.378
Nurse Marquez
will show you there.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.948
I think she's saying thank you.

36:59.585 --> 37:02.654
Uh, hey, Mr. Landry,
can I talk to you for a second?

37:07.626 --> 37:09.561
You know, the
people you love,

37:09.628 --> 37:11.997
they can't always help who
they are, and they do stuff

37:12.063 --> 37:13.499
we don't understand,

37:13.565 --> 37:14.733
but you have to just
try and get past that,

37:14.800 --> 37:16.968
especially when
they need you.

37:23.141 --> 37:26.645
Okay, um...

37:26.712 --> 37:28.179
okay, there is a
clinical trial.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.916
It's called a
bioartificial liver...

37:30.982 --> 37:31.917
Okay.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.785
Okay.

37:33.852 --> 37:37.255
I'll donate if I can.

37:37.323 --> 37:38.256
(sighs)

37:38.324 --> 37:41.026
How do I get tested?

37:41.960 --> 37:44.330
We can do it here.

38:13.592 --> 38:16.662
(clipboard clanks lightly)

38:32.844 --> 38:34.813
(typing)

38:34.880 --> 38:37.816
(music playing, laughter)
SHERYL:
I'm home! I'm home! I'm home!

38:37.883 --> 38:40.519
Baby, baby, baby.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.456
Come here, my love, come here.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.625
* Ah, ah, ah, ah. *

38:46.692 --> 38:48.159
You got no moves, Dad.

38:48.226 --> 38:50.996
(laughing):
He's got moves.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.598
Shake it, baby.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.300
CLETUS:
Yeah.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.468
(Sheryl laughing)

38:56.535 --> 38:58.003
Those are moves.
Oh, yeah.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.405
Those are moves.

38:59.471 --> 39:02.474
Whoo!

39:02.541 --> 39:04.910
CLETUS:
Look at Mom move.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.345
(rhythmic clapping)

39:07.413 --> 39:09.948
(laughter)

39:10.015 --> 39:14.319
* Singing,
as we danced in the night *

39:14.386 --> 39:20.392
* Remember how the stars stole
the night away... *

39:20.459 --> 39:23.529
Family seems
to be taking it well.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.330
Should have been an attending
there this morning.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.565
The outcome
would have been the same.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.033
You don't know that.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.367
I've been operating with you
for three years now

39:29.435 --> 39:30.502
and I do know that.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.770
If I had stayed
with you,

39:31.837 --> 39:33.104
the patient in the ICU
would have died.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.773
What, so instead
it's Sheryl?

39:34.840 --> 39:37.643
Look, you're emotional because
you got close to the patient.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.145
That's okay, but it's clouding
your judgment.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.647
You know,
if wanting her

39:41.713 --> 39:42.781
to get the best possible
treatment is clouded,

39:42.848 --> 39:44.850
then, yes, you're right.
Neela,

39:44.916 --> 39:46.351
Neela...
You could have approached
the perf differently.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.352
Neela...
I can't
even be sure

39:47.419 --> 39:48.520
I got all the abscesses.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.988
Stop now, okay?

39:50.055 --> 39:52.257
I know what it's like
to be close to a patient,

39:52.323 --> 39:54.025
but you're not
a little intern anymore,

39:54.092 --> 39:56.962
and I expect you to handle bad
outcomes like a professional.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.296
What does that mean?

39:58.363 --> 39:59.731
That I should stop
giving a damn?

39:59.798 --> 40:01.567
No, it means that no matter
how much we care,

40:01.633 --> 40:03.835
sometimes the people
we try to save die.

40:03.902 --> 40:07.639
Are you trying to
rationalize this?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.274
'Cause we both know

40:09.340 --> 40:11.009
you should have never left
that room this morning.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.010
That's enough.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.446
Please.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.714
There are more patients

40:15.781 --> 40:16.748
than there are doctors
in this place,

40:16.815 --> 40:18.584
and I can't be everywhere.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.285
None of this
should be news to you.

40:20.351 --> 40:21.920
This is the job.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.738
(sighs)

40:53.485 --> 40:55.453
Oh, Abby,

40:55.521 --> 40:57.422
Exam 2 lady finished
her Dilantin load.

40:57.489 --> 41:00.592
Okay, she can be dispo'd.

41:00.659 --> 41:01.727
Thank you.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.961
Take care.
You, too.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.130
(clears throat)

41:07.499 --> 41:09.434
Laverne, you know how
to bury the knot?

41:09.501 --> 41:11.970
Okay, just start
at the base of the wound,

41:12.037 --> 41:14.840
sub-Q, good,

41:14.906 --> 41:17.543
and now go sub-Q
to the other side.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.645
There you go.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.079
Gives you better approximation
and cosmesis.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.181
Thank you, Dr. Lockhart.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.950
Sure.

41:26.685 --> 41:29.187
Hey, Abby, wait up.

41:29.254 --> 41:30.756
So I talked with Anspaugh.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.558
Yeah, I told you
I already took the...

41:32.624 --> 41:33.625
Yeah, I know,
I know, I know.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.326
Just hear me out, okay?

41:35.393 --> 41:37.829
(knocking)

41:37.896 --> 41:38.797
Hi.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.231
I'm not interrupting, am I?

41:40.298 --> 41:41.967
No, not at all.

41:44.402 --> 41:46.972
I was, uh...

41:47.038 --> 41:51.009
hoping maybe you had
a little time next week.

41:52.210 --> 41:55.513
To talk.

41:55.581 --> 41:56.715
Where have you two been?

41:56.782 --> 41:57.916
Nowhere.
Exam 3.

41:57.983 --> 41:59.551
Dr. Gates,
GYN has a bed,

41:59.618 --> 42:01.720
but they can't take your PID
for two hours.

42:01.787 --> 42:03.722
All right,
everybody, listen up.

42:03.789 --> 42:05.857
I have a wonderful
announcement to make.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.793
It is with
great pleasure

42:07.859 --> 42:11.262
to introduce Dr. Abby Lockhart,
our newest attending physician.

42:11.329 --> 42:12.497
(cheering and applause)

42:12.564 --> 42:13.665
Cider, anyone?

42:13.732 --> 42:14.532
What happened?
You're staying?

42:14.600 --> 42:15.734
Yeah, wild horses.

42:15.801 --> 42:17.202
TAGGART:
Congrats, Abby.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.737
Glutton for
punishment, huh?
Guess so.

42:18.804 --> 42:20.405
A party?
Of course no one told me.

42:20.471 --> 42:21.940
No, Abby's the new attending.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.742
Oh, that's great.
Way to go.
Thanks.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.811
Frank, how about a little
for me, huh?
Me, too.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.979
Yeah, just cool
your jets, everybody.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.649
Hey, Luka,
I thought I'd catch you.

42:30.716 --> 42:32.751
Um, I know I'm gonna see you
in a little bit

42:32.818 --> 42:34.519
when you come to pick up Joe,

42:34.586 --> 42:39.357
but I just wanted to tell you
that I got the job at County.

42:39.424 --> 42:41.159
Thought you'd want to know.
