00:02.352 --> 00:03.281
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

00:03.281 --> 00:05.515
Don't use that one. It's icky.

00:05.981 --> 00:07.647
God doesn't make mistakes very often,

00:07.649 --> 00:09.065
but when he does,

00:09.067 --> 00:10.634
you have to throw them right in the trash.

00:10.636 --> 00:11.635
- Oh.
- Does this make sense

00:11.637 --> 00:12.686
To anyone else?

00:12.688 --> 00:15.088
White dress, $30.

00:15.090 --> 00:17.490
White wedding dress, $200.

00:17.492 --> 00:19.125
Is there cocaine in this or something?

00:19.127 --> 00:21.094
Yeah. The wedding industry's a racket.

00:21.096 --> 00:23.313
Oh, you think everything is a racket.

00:23.315 --> 00:26.633
And that is the last of it, Glenn.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.635
Wow. Hmm.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.287
I'm just gonna say what we all thinking.

00:32.290 --> 00:34.474
This is pretty as hell.

00:34.476 --> 00:36.576
Oh, it's 8:00.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.927
Ooh, wait. Uh, hold on.

00:37.929 --> 00:39.379
I just want to move that.

00:39.381 --> 00:40.547
That's not in center.

00:40.549 --> 00:42.132
That should be in center.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.925
Oh, no, no.

00:57.983 --> 01:00.767
Well, that was a good use
of the last five hours.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.642
They realize they're basically
just fighting over a white net

01:09.644 --> 01:10.877
with glitter on it, right?

01:10.879 --> 01:12.779
Mm, I got five bucks on the blonde.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.147
Yeah, I'll take that action.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.684
How are there already this many go backs?

01:17.686 --> 01:19.302
We've been open for five minutes.

01:19.304 --> 01:21.971
Oh, I'm actually here as a customer today.

01:21.973 --> 01:23.690
How do I look?

01:23.692 --> 01:25.008
Ooh, wow.

01:25.010 --> 01:26.543
Aw, that's hella nice, yo.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.011
Yo, where's the laptops at?

01:28.013 --> 01:29.496
We need, like, five or six of those things.

01:29.498 --> 01:31.097
My band is playing at our wedding.

01:31.099 --> 01:33.016
Yeah, we're gonna smash
computers as part of the act

01:33.018 --> 01:35.685
'cause, you know, like, technology.

01:35.687 --> 01:37.871
Uh... Wow.

01:37.873 --> 01:40.523
That sounds like an expensive
celebration you're planning.

01:40.525 --> 01:42.425
It's about 500 people.

01:42.427 --> 01:43.727
I wanted to invite more,

01:43.729 --> 01:45.962
but I couldn't afford any more stamps.

01:45.964 --> 01:47.747
I bet your parents are all, like,

01:47.749 --> 01:51.084
"Don't spend all your money on one day!

01:51.086 --> 01:53.553
Save some for the baby."

01:53.555 --> 01:54.521
Parents.

01:54.523 --> 01:56.005
Nah. Five G's, son.

01:56.007 --> 01:57.941
Yo, what's up? Making it rain!

01:57.943 --> 02:00.026
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:00.028 --> 02:01.961
Stand down. Drop that paper, yo.

02:01.963 --> 02:03.379
It's mine.

02:03.381 --> 02:04.848
Where did you get all of that?

02:04.850 --> 02:07.333
Bo got hit by a car in the seventh grade

02:07.335 --> 02:08.585
By an old lady.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.204
She was legally blind and super drunk.

02:11.206 --> 02:12.806
Isn't he lucky?

02:12.808 --> 02:14.340
Yeah, your boy here was
just crossing the street,

02:14.342 --> 02:15.792
then it was like, crash!

02:15.794 --> 02:17.393
Oh, going to the light.

02:17.395 --> 02:18.845
I'm like, "No god. Later.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.363
I got stuff to accomplish. Later, light."

02:20.365 --> 02:21.598
I pick up a phone.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.133
"Yo, Hello, Lawyer?"

02:23.135 --> 02:24.417
"Yo, settle out of court?

02:24.419 --> 02:26.002
I think so. Yes."

02:26.004 --> 02:27.520
Wha-chaah. Money.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.872
Ha-ha!

02:28.874 --> 02:31.624
So you just walk around
with $5,000 in your pocket?

02:31.626 --> 02:33.793
That's right. I always
got that right here.

02:33.795 --> 02:35.728
Uh-oh. Where's that five G's?

02:35.730 --> 02:36.996
Yo, I was just kidding, dummies.

02:36.998 --> 02:39.032
I got that right here. Oh, no.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.266
Yo, where's it at, for real?

02:40.268 --> 02:42.102
It's right there.

02:42.104 --> 02:43.937
Oh.

02:43.939 --> 02:45.238
Oh, what's up?

02:45.240 --> 02:46.589
Good looking out, yo.

02:46.591 --> 02:48.308
Please don't tip me.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.011
Ma'am, I have the arm strength of a chimp,

02:52.013 --> 02:54.114
but there is just too
much real estate back here.

02:54.116 --> 02:57.217
I'd have to dislocate your shoulder.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.002
Do it.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.653
Okay.

03:00.655 --> 03:01.955
But you'll have to teach
one of your bridesmaids

03:01.957 --> 03:03.423
to do this on the day.

03:03.425 --> 03:05.558
And they actually have money saved up,

03:05.560 --> 03:07.544
but instead of using
it to pay for the baby,

03:07.546 --> 03:09.829
they're gonna blow it
all on some big party.

03:09.831 --> 03:11.030
What?

03:11.032 --> 03:13.600
Two 17-year-olds are
making a bad decision?

03:13.602 --> 03:14.784
What?

03:14.786 --> 03:16.503
I thought that only
happened in the movies.

03:16.505 --> 03:19.155
I'm just saying that I
wish somebody had warned me

03:19.157 --> 03:20.673
Not to spend so much money on a wedding.

03:20.675 --> 03:22.392
I'm telling you.

03:22.394 --> 03:24.444
People do not like to be
told how to spend their money.

03:24.446 --> 03:25.812
Really?

03:25.814 --> 03:27.030
So does that mean you'll stop telling me

03:27.032 --> 03:28.398
To call your "Dad's friend?"

03:28.400 --> 03:29.916
That's about making you money,

03:29.918 --> 03:31.317
and if you saw the
charts that he showed me...

03:31.319 --> 03:33.419
Oh, yeah. The charts.

03:39.561 --> 03:41.761
Hi. Where are the twinkly white lights?

03:41.763 --> 03:44.063
It's an outdoor ceremony, so
they have to be weatherproof.

03:44.065 --> 03:46.232
- I will take you to them.
- Thank you.

03:46.234 --> 03:48.801
Which one of you is the lucky fella?

03:48.803 --> 03:51.321
Oh, well, actually, we both are.

03:51.323 --> 03:53.373
I love that!

03:53.375 --> 03:55.074
The four of you can celebrate

03:55.076 --> 03:57.343
Your anniversary together every year.

03:57.345 --> 03:58.344
- No...
- Congratulations

03:58.346 --> 04:00.430
- On your wedding!
- Yes.

04:00.432 --> 04:01.447
To each other.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.383
- To...
- Yeah.

04:03.385 --> 04:06.719
Oh!

04:06.721 --> 04:08.621
Outdoor lighting is in aisle four.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.039
If you need anything else, just ask.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.491
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

04:11.493 --> 04:13.393
Have a heavenly day!

04:14.496 --> 04:16.045
Thank you.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.747
I don't know how,

04:17.749 --> 04:19.832
but you really seem to have
a handle on this whole gay,

04:19.834 --> 04:22.051
you know...

04:22.053 --> 04:24.871
Oh!

04:24.873 --> 04:26.673
That's great, Mateo!

04:26.675 --> 04:28.691
Congratulations on that.

04:28.693 --> 04:30.510
You know, I thought you might be,

04:30.512 --> 04:31.911
But I-I wasn't sure,

04:31.913 --> 04:33.363
and then I forgot about it.

04:33.365 --> 04:36.783
But now I know, and
that's terrific with me.

04:36.785 --> 04:38.301
Yeah.

04:38.303 --> 04:39.752
Oh, bam!

04:39.754 --> 04:41.988
I'm about to blow up this alien so bad.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.590
Whoa. Oh.

04:43.592 --> 04:47.827
Chey, you know babies
come with lots of expenses...

04:47.829 --> 04:50.680
Is what your dumb parents would say.

04:50.682 --> 04:52.482
Remember, from before?

04:52.484 --> 04:54.300
Aah, parents.

04:54.302 --> 04:56.519
- Oh.
- Yeah.

04:56.521 --> 04:58.471
But your parents do make a good point.

04:58.473 --> 05:00.823
Well, my mom said that
we should save some money,

05:00.825 --> 05:04.427
but then, Bo is all like,
"Nah," so it's a tough call.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.447
Dang! Those aliens are smart as hell!

05:07.449 --> 05:09.249
You want to go back to shopping?

05:09.251 --> 05:10.483
- Yes.
- Hey, guys.

05:10.485 --> 05:12.318
You want to play a different game?

05:12.320 --> 05:13.553
Blam!

05:13.555 --> 05:14.754
- Diapers!
- Boom!

05:14.756 --> 05:15.972
- Wipes!
- Blast!

05:15.974 --> 05:17.390
- Bottle warmer.
- Headshot!

05:17.392 --> 05:19.092
- More diapers.
- Poo-poo!

05:19.094 --> 05:20.677
- Breast pump.
- Squirt, squirt!

05:20.679 --> 05:21.928
- Diaper bag.
- Pew, pew!

05:21.930 --> 05:23.529
See you in hell, cute baby stuff.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.315
Bo, you're killing them all!

05:25.317 --> 05:27.066
And time's up.

05:27.068 --> 05:29.102
What's up? 2,500 points!

05:29.104 --> 05:31.804
Your boy here is getting a Charleston Chew!

05:31.806 --> 05:33.573
Actually, those aren't points.

05:33.575 --> 05:36.459
Those are dollars, and that's
how much this stuff costs.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.345
This stuff is $2,500?

05:39.347 --> 05:41.314
That's, like, half of Bo's stack.

05:41.316 --> 05:45.518
Plus a car seat and a crib and daycare,

05:45.520 --> 05:48.154
and it just keeps coming.

05:48.156 --> 05:49.756
Dang.

05:49.758 --> 05:52.058
I'm gonna have to get hit by so many cars.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.243
Maybe we should save
some of our wedding money

05:54.245 --> 05:55.628
for the future.

05:55.630 --> 05:57.981
Huh, yeah.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.415
You could do that.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.301
You do have to make some sacrifices

06:01.303 --> 06:02.685
When you're a parent.

06:02.687 --> 06:06.773
I mean, your whole life changes.

06:06.775 --> 06:10.476
Bo, you look weird.

06:10.478 --> 06:11.527
Yeah. Hey.

06:11.529 --> 06:13.112
But I think it's great

06:13.114 --> 06:15.064
That you guys are starting
to think about being...

06:15.066 --> 06:17.367
Aah!

06:17.369 --> 06:18.651
- Hey, look out.
- Bo?

06:18.653 --> 06:19.869
Excuse me. Oh, sorry.

06:19.871 --> 06:22.822
Bo?

06:22.824 --> 06:24.490
I was gonna say "responsible."

06:26.924 --> 06:29.698
Where did you go? Please come back.

06:29.698 --> 06:31.315
I love you.

06:31.317 --> 06:33.083
It's Cheyenne, by the way.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.685
Hey, you had to go freak
the little dummy out?

06:34.687 --> 06:35.986
Well, it's not my fault.

06:35.988 --> 06:36.987
Oh, she's right.

06:36.988 --> 06:38.671
She was just teaching us this fun game

06:38.673 --> 06:42.341
about how expensive and
scary it is to have a baby.

06:43.344 --> 06:44.827
What if he never comes back?

06:44.830 --> 06:46.530
He will. He's gonna come back.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.297
He will!

06:48.299 --> 06:49.265
And you know what?

06:49.267 --> 06:50.750
If he doesn't,

06:50.752 --> 06:52.018
That wouldn't be the worst thing...

06:52.021 --> 06:54.021
Going right back at it, huh?

06:54.023 --> 06:55.455
Okay.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.973
You know what? Um... I'll go look for him.

06:57.976 --> 06:59.643
Could tag along with me if you want.

06:59.644 --> 07:02.022
That turd walked out with
a Cloud 9 scanner gun.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.329
That makes it my jurisdiction.

07:03.565 --> 07:04.981
He is not a turd.

07:04.983 --> 07:06.400
Oh, he's a turd.

07:06.401 --> 07:07.983
Also, my truck has a rather unique odor,

07:07.985 --> 07:10.152
but you should get used to
it after a couple of hours.

07:10.155 --> 07:12.205
Oh... No, thank you.

07:12.206 --> 07:14.890
We should probably just split up, you know,

07:14.892 --> 07:16.225
cover more ground.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.195
Up to you. Oh...

07:18.197 --> 07:19.713
Almost forgot my taser.

07:19.715 --> 07:21.214
- Oh
- Oh!

07:21.216 --> 07:23.600
Okay. I'm coming with you!

07:23.602 --> 07:25.369
Take care of her.

07:25.371 --> 07:27.571
Uh, hey, hey. Now, now.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.522
Now, now. There, little lady.

07:29.524 --> 07:32.224
You're gonna... you're
gonna do just fine, kiddo.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.623
Girl.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.625
I learned that from Wendy Williams.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.816
If you're hungry, that can
of beans is up for grabs,

07:49.818 --> 07:51.468
But not this one.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.470
I'm good.

07:53.472 --> 07:56.123
Do you mind if I turn on
the... where's your radio?

07:56.125 --> 07:58.025
Oh, I special ordered my truck without one.

07:58.027 --> 07:59.543
Yeah, it costs a little extra,

07:59.545 --> 08:01.495
but it makes the vehicle
less appealing to thieves

08:01.497 --> 08:03.947
'cause no one wants a
truck without a radio.

08:03.949 --> 08:06.433
Name a song, though. I'll sing it for you.

08:06.435 --> 08:07.851
- That's okay.
- No, no, go ahead.

08:07.853 --> 08:09.803
I got a photographic memory for music.

08:09.805 --> 08:11.655
Okay, um...

08:11.657 --> 08:13.040
"Single Ladies."

08:13.042 --> 08:14.224
Not familiar with that one.

08:14.226 --> 08:15.976
- "Uptown Funk."
- Don't know it.

08:15.978 --> 08:17.411
- "Dancing Queen."
- Nope.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.596
"Thriller?"

08:19.598 --> 08:21.365
Michael Jackson?

08:21.367 --> 08:22.616
You can't name a song by some guy

08:22.618 --> 08:23.817
you went to middle school with.

08:23.819 --> 08:25.819
It has to be popular.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.152
I can't be a single mom.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.755
I have never even driven
on the highway before.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.606
What if the baby needs to go downtown?

08:46.608 --> 08:49.359
Okay, again, Bo is coming back, all right?

08:49.361 --> 08:51.161
And when he does, you're
gonna have a cart full

08:51.163 --> 08:54.264
of hella radical wedding stuff to show him.

08:54.266 --> 08:55.615
Yeah, like these little ass pillows

08:55.617 --> 08:57.968
to put the rings on
'cause they're important.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.486
Bo once threw up on a pillow

08:59.488 --> 09:01.655
at my Grandma's retirement party.

09:03.192 --> 09:06.143
Everything I see reminds
me of how amazing he was.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.812
Okay. Surprising triggers.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.714
We'll pick for you. What do you think?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.265
Pfft...

09:12.267 --> 09:13.500
This one. Done.

09:13.502 --> 09:14.684
Moving on.

09:14.686 --> 09:15.936
- Ooh.
- What? What's up?

09:15.938 --> 09:17.487
It's a little burlapy.

09:17.489 --> 09:18.789
She's getting married, not shipping coffee.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.257
Ah.

09:20.259 --> 09:21.558
Why don't we just go with this one?

09:21.560 --> 09:23.126
Well, you know what? Your call.

09:23.128 --> 09:26.163
Do you want to go warm and
rustic like this burlap one

09:26.165 --> 09:28.899
Or generic, kind of unoriginal?

09:29.902 --> 09:32.269
I guess warm and rustic.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.854
Warm and rustic! All right.

09:33.856 --> 09:35.806
- We got ourself a pillow.
- Okay.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.225
Next up on the wedding
train, "Guest Books".

09:38.227 --> 09:39.226
Okay.

09:49.621 --> 09:52.939
I feel terrible about how
I handled things earlier

09:52.941 --> 09:54.357
with your friends.

09:54.359 --> 09:56.710
Friends? Oh, they're not... no.

09:56.712 --> 09:58.445
- They're not my friends, dude.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:58.447 --> 10:01.248
Gay BFFs?

10:01.250 --> 10:02.883
I don't know the lingo.

10:02.885 --> 10:05.402
Look, I just want everyone
who comes into this store

10:05.404 --> 10:07.087
to feel accepted.

10:07.089 --> 10:09.222
But do you know that in this entire sale,

10:09.224 --> 10:12.309
there is not one section
dedicated to gay weddings?

10:12.311 --> 10:14.277
Gay people use the same
decorations as straight people.

10:14.279 --> 10:15.495
We just use 'em better.

10:15.497 --> 10:17.464
That's my point exactly.

10:17.466 --> 10:19.316
I mean, they should not have to conform

10:19.318 --> 10:24.971
to someone's... Hel... hetero normal ideal

10:24.973 --> 10:27.190
of what a wedding should be.

10:27.192 --> 10:31.111
Would you be willing to help
me put something together?

10:31.113 --> 10:32.496
Of course.

10:32.498 --> 10:33.997
Great.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.933
We're gonna take those
guy's minds and blow them.

10:38.370 --> 10:42.339
I don't know if just randomly
driving around is a good idea.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.741
Where do teenagers go?

10:44.743 --> 10:45.892
Prom.

10:45.894 --> 10:47.527
Is there a prom around?

10:47.529 --> 10:50.497
No, I just meant that we
should think like a teenager.

10:50.499 --> 10:51.798
Ah, yeah.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.551
Hey, Mom, get out of my room.

10:54.553 --> 10:57.187
You don't understand my generation.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.573
Pimples.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.758
It's not helping.

11:02.469 --> 11:03.668
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

11:03.670 --> 11:05.053
Is that him?

11:05.054 --> 11:06.387
Hey! Hey!

11:06.389 --> 11:07.905
Stop! It's him, it's him.

11:07.907 --> 11:08.956
Speed up. Go, go, go.

11:08.958 --> 11:10.407
Bo!

11:10.409 --> 11:11.876
Hey, Bo!

11:11.878 --> 11:14.828
We just want to talk! Stop!

11:14.830 --> 11:16.247
That's one of our carts.

11:16.249 --> 11:17.498
That's one of our carts.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.836
What? Who cares? Bo!

11:20.125 --> 11:21.262
What are you doing?

11:23.212 --> 11:24.711
Who cares?

11:24.713 --> 11:26.296
I care.

11:26.298 --> 11:27.764
Hey.

11:27.766 --> 11:29.349
That is Cloud 9 store property!

11:29.352 --> 11:30.351
No, it's not.

11:30.353 --> 11:33.938
Dina! He's getting away!

11:33.939 --> 11:35.772
Bo!

11:35.775 --> 11:37.475
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

11:37.477 --> 11:39.060
- Give it to me.
- Hey it's not your cart!

11:49.131 --> 11:49.996
You know, on second thought,

11:49.996 --> 11:51.336
I don't think that is one of our carts.

11:52.881 --> 11:54.548
So what are we thinking for lunch?

11:54.550 --> 11:56.066
Sandwiches? Burritos?

11:56.068 --> 11:57.501
Indian? Tapas?

11:57.503 --> 11:58.702
What is up with you?

11:58.704 --> 12:00.270
Do you even want to find Bo?

12:00.272 --> 12:01.672
Yes, of course I do.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.098
Just... Maybe not right away.

12:07.446 --> 12:10.480
I'm really not anxious to get
back to the wedding day sale,

12:10.482 --> 12:11.882
Okay?

12:11.884 --> 12:13.550
Just seeing all those women celebrating,

12:13.552 --> 12:15.452
Having found someone,

12:15.454 --> 12:16.920
and I'm not getting any younger.

12:16.922 --> 12:19.656
- Kind of a bummer.
- Well, it can be hard to date.

12:19.658 --> 12:21.274
If you'd seen some of the guys I dated.

12:22.961 --> 12:25.195
Gay. Racist.

12:25.197 --> 12:27.531
Mean. Redhead.

12:27.533 --> 12:28.778
That was all one guy.

12:29.018 --> 12:31.668
Oh, I've dated some losers.

12:31.670 --> 12:33.070
I dated this one guy

12:33.073 --> 12:35.373
Who would only speak
in Monty Python quotes.

12:35.374 --> 12:36.990
The last guy I dated only hung out with me

12:36.992 --> 12:38.642
to play chess with my dad,

12:38.644 --> 12:41.228
and the guy before that was
just using me for my freezer.

12:41.230 --> 12:42.946
I dated three guys

12:42.949 --> 12:46.467
who were dating me just to
get close to my friend, Rene,

12:46.468 --> 12:49.486
and Rene wasn't even that hot.

12:49.488 --> 12:52.472
Whatever. This is not about Rene.

12:54.827 --> 12:56.960
Well, Rene sounds like a sack of crap.

12:56.962 --> 12:59.312
She was. Thank you.

12:59.314 --> 13:00.564
I just call it like I see it.

13:00.566 --> 13:03.350
Yes.

13:03.352 --> 13:06.002
There is... A guy at work

13:06.004 --> 13:09.222
That things have been
getting pretty intense with.

13:09.224 --> 13:11.074
Really? Who?

13:11.076 --> 13:12.659
Well, I don't want to
talk about my personal life

13:12.661 --> 13:14.795
with coworkers, but I will say

13:14.798 --> 13:18.616
that there has been some very
heavy flirtation happening.

13:18.617 --> 13:20.333
I've been changing my
shirt multiple times a day

13:20.335 --> 13:22.386
just 'cause of all the pit stains.

13:22.388 --> 13:23.904
Steamy stuff.

13:25.674 --> 13:26.940
How's this?

13:26.942 --> 13:28.158
It's nice.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.710
But is it gay enough?

13:29.712 --> 13:31.378
I don't want to be kicking myself later

13:31.380 --> 13:33.363
that we should have gone more gay.

13:33.365 --> 13:34.881
Let's err on the side of gay.

13:34.883 --> 13:36.616
It feels appropriately gay.

13:36.618 --> 13:37.567
Good.

13:37.569 --> 13:39.503
You know, I have to say,

13:39.505 --> 13:41.938
You're much more
open-minded than I thought.

13:41.940 --> 13:43.590
Thank you.

13:43.593 --> 13:46.994
People assume all
Christians are homophobes.

13:46.995 --> 13:48.795
You know, that is ignorant.

13:48.797 --> 13:53.100
You can't imagine how hard
it is being stereotyped.

13:53.102 --> 13:54.951
- Sure.
- I mean, if anything,

13:54.953 --> 13:58.438
Jesus went out of his
way to accept everyone.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.606
- Agreed.
- Yeah.

13:59.608 --> 14:01.341
I think Jesus would've
been pro gay marriage.

14:01.343 --> 14:02.325
Absolutely.

14:02.327 --> 14:04.377
He would've been pro-gay adoption.

14:04.379 --> 14:07.347
For all we know, Jesus himself was gay.

14:10.203 --> 14:11.769
So it's Tuesday, right?

14:11.771 --> 14:14.322
That means... that
means Wednesday's coming.

14:14.323 --> 14:16.890
Mm. Shake?

14:16.892 --> 14:18.792
No, thanks. Vegan.

14:18.794 --> 14:21.428
- Huh.
- Yeah.

14:21.430 --> 14:23.029
You know, we can keep looking for Bo,

14:23.031 --> 14:25.165
but the guy can't bike forever,

14:25.167 --> 14:27.284
especially not with those quads.

14:27.286 --> 14:28.618
What don't you like him?

14:28.620 --> 14:30.554
Is it the mustache?

14:30.556 --> 14:32.355
No.

14:32.357 --> 14:34.975
I got married at 19.

14:34.977 --> 14:37.360
I know what they're in for.

14:37.362 --> 14:39.946
I mean, you miss out on a lot of stuff.

14:39.948 --> 14:42.315
I mean, you get stuff too, obviously,

14:42.317 --> 14:44.835
but the money's always tight,

14:44.837 --> 14:47.053
and you're five steps
ahead of where you should be

14:47.055 --> 14:50.574
but also five steps behind
where you should've been.

14:50.576 --> 14:52.425
But the mustache is bad, right?

14:52.427 --> 14:54.861
Strawberry blondes should not
be allowed to grow facial hair.

14:54.863 --> 14:56.096
No.

14:56.098 --> 14:57.430
That should be in our constitution.

14:57.432 --> 14:58.932
Yeah.

14:58.934 --> 15:02.469
Well, we should probably go back.

15:02.471 --> 15:05.405
God, I hope the brides have cleared out.

15:05.407 --> 15:07.274
You know, no one's really gonna notice

15:07.276 --> 15:09.576
if we're gone another hour or two.

15:09.578 --> 15:11.378
Well, what would we do?

15:11.380 --> 15:12.562
Um...

15:12.564 --> 15:15.582
Oh, we could pamper ourselves.

15:17.302 --> 15:18.518
Oh, yeah.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.986
The place is way fancier

15:19.988 --> 15:21.872
than my usual spot.

15:21.874 --> 15:24.474
Moist towelettes to wipe up the gunpowder.

15:24.476 --> 15:27.561
Man, I feel like a princess.

15:27.563 --> 15:28.829
I think I saw a turquoise one.

15:28.831 --> 15:30.347
Boom, cake stand.

15:30.349 --> 15:32.299
Silver-plated, lace bows.

15:32.301 --> 15:34.201
This is all kinds of elegant.

15:34.203 --> 15:36.286
If someone came up to you with
a wheelbarrow full of elegance,

15:36.288 --> 15:37.787
you'd have to be like, "Sorry, Homie".

15:37.789 --> 15:39.122
"We ass-deep in elegance."

15:39.124 --> 15:40.390
That's really pretty.

15:40.392 --> 15:41.641
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, no.

15:41.643 --> 15:43.109
That would be... really,

15:43.111 --> 15:45.011
it'd be perfect for a
traditional wedding cake.

15:45.013 --> 15:45.962
- Yeah.
- But we were talking more of,

15:45.964 --> 15:48.532
like, a dessert pot luck kind of a thing.

15:48.534 --> 15:50.767
For a wedding? That seems
a little adventurous.

15:50.770 --> 15:54.038
Jonah says a lot of weddings
are doing more DIY elements.

15:54.039 --> 15:55.722
We're just looking for
something a little more

15:55.725 --> 15:56.824
specifically curated
to Cheyenne and Bo's...

15:56.825 --> 15:58.074
Ugh, that word.

15:58.076 --> 15:59.326
You said I could say "curated" once a week.

15:59.328 --> 16:00.677
I chose now as my time.

16:00.679 --> 16:02.946
Honestly, as long as Bo
is there, I don't even...

16:02.948 --> 16:04.147
Yeah, no, no, no.
Totally, totally, totally.

16:04.149 --> 16:05.999
I'm just saying, I don't think a wedding

16:06.001 --> 16:08.251
needs to be stuck in
stodgy, old traditions.

16:08.253 --> 16:10.704
Right, better to have the
wedding in a treehouse,

16:10.707 --> 16:12.857
drinking artisanal cocktails out of a tuba.

16:12.858 --> 16:15.492
A DIY element does add a
certain personal touch to it.

16:15.494 --> 16:17.043
It's a trend, like dancing down the aisle.

16:17.045 --> 16:18.345
You know, it's like, "I'm eating flan."

16:18.347 --> 16:19.729
"I'm eating a baklava."

16:19.731 --> 16:20.981
Why couldn't we just
have a nice, classy cake

16:20.983 --> 16:22.215
like civilized human beings?

16:22.217 --> 16:23.667
Give my taste buds a passport

16:23.669 --> 16:25.569
because they're going around the world.

16:25.571 --> 16:26.770
Let's go over some basics.

16:26.772 --> 16:28.439
You're gonna take your mag.

16:28.539 --> 16:31.557
The flat part is actually gonna
go towards the back of the gun.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.014
My favorite uncle was a cop.

16:39.016 --> 16:41.917
He got me a .22 for my Quinceañera.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.335
Here, I thought you were just

16:43.337 --> 16:45.103
the second-hottest girl at work.

16:50.928 --> 16:53.178
Hey, you should come with me
to celebrity night sometime.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.063
They put pictures on the targets.

16:55.065 --> 16:56.648
I don't want to brag, but last week,

16:56.651 --> 16:58.401
Kristen Stewart was my bitch.

16:58.402 --> 16:59.685
Oh, my god.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.520
Yeah, it's really satisfying.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.188
I think tomorrow they're doing
the whole cast of "Scandal."

17:05.597 --> 17:07.431
So, you just gonna walk
out on your fiancé?

17:07.433 --> 17:09.252
You think that's "Where it's at?"

17:09.285 --> 17:10.701
Kinda. Okay.

17:10.703 --> 17:12.336
Like, everyone cool I know has done that.

17:12.338 --> 17:15.005
Most rappers. Literally every athlete.

17:15.007 --> 17:16.040
You know what?

17:16.041 --> 17:17.625
Cheyenne is better off without you.

17:17.627 --> 17:20.211
What's this?

17:20.213 --> 17:21.462
"Bo Derek Thompson.

17:21.464 --> 17:23.513
"Suma Cum Laude, Harvard medical school.

17:23.516 --> 17:25.883
Chief of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins."

17:25.885 --> 17:27.384
Yo, some of that's left over

17:27.386 --> 17:28.969
from the computer template or whatever.

17:28.971 --> 17:30.855
Wait, this is what you were doing all day?

17:30.857 --> 17:32.723
You were handing out resumes?

17:32.725 --> 17:34.558
And your name is Bo Derek?

17:34.560 --> 17:36.894
Yeah, it's like you said.
Parenting's expensive.

17:36.896 --> 17:39.363
Got to make some paper for
that baby coming, be a man.

17:39.365 --> 17:43.067
"Managing editor of vogue, 1972-1981."

17:43.069 --> 17:45.202
I'm impressed, actually.

17:45.204 --> 17:46.787
Oh no, Amy. This is all lies.

17:49.411 --> 17:51.361
Oh, what a surprise.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.413
You picked a white dress. What a curveball.

17:53.415 --> 17:54.915
'Cause that's exactly
what a wedding should be,

17:54.917 --> 17:56.450
A series of curveballs.

17:56.452 --> 17:58.251
You guys, it's really sweet that you care,

17:58.253 --> 18:00.120
but both dresses are fugly.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.621
I just think that your tastes are

18:01.623 --> 18:03.790
a little more along the
lines of my grandmother's.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.625
Okay, well, I just think that

18:05.627 --> 18:07.461
your tastes are a little
more along the lines

18:07.463 --> 18:08.762
of a Wiccan space queen.

18:08.764 --> 18:09.846
What?

18:09.848 --> 18:10.964
What's your dream wedding, anyway?

18:10.966 --> 18:12.265
A bunch of people sweating in a field

18:12.267 --> 18:13.800
while some jag reads from
"The Velveteen Rabbit?"

18:13.802 --> 18:15.102
What's your dream wedding?

18:15.104 --> 18:19.056
A beige Toyota Camry driven
by a white guy named Matthew?

18:19.058 --> 18:20.640
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You know!

18:20.642 --> 18:22.809
What do you say? You want
to look like my Aunt Linda?

18:22.811 --> 18:25.445
You cannot get married in a green bean.

18:25.447 --> 18:27.064
Right this way.

18:33.138 --> 18:36.823
Welcome. We are happy you're here.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.125
You guys made this?

18:38.127 --> 18:39.326
It's really nice.

18:39.328 --> 18:41.211
You think this is nice?

18:41.213 --> 18:42.496
You better buckle in

18:42.498 --> 18:44.998
'cause the party is just getting started.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.417
It is? We didn't discuss... okay.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.253
oh.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.005
Pose yourself. There's nothing like it.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.473
Vogue!

18:53.475 --> 18:54.925
- Wow.
- Vogue.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.810
Glenn, this isn't what we agreed on!

18:56.812 --> 18:58.428
I made a few tweaks.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.181
I turned my safe search up to the max

19:01.183 --> 19:03.683
and then Googled, "world's gayest parties."

19:03.685 --> 19:05.018
Wow.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.853
Listen. He's trying.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.656
He's your dad, two years ago.

19:09.658 --> 19:11.825
Oh, okay.

19:11.827 --> 19:12.909
Yeah.

19:12.911 --> 19:13.994
This was great.

19:13.996 --> 19:16.113
Thank you so much.

19:16.115 --> 19:17.364
- You're welcome.
- Oh, another one.

19:17.366 --> 19:19.916
Wow.

19:19.918 --> 19:21.034
- Get those hands up.
- All right.

19:21.036 --> 19:23.253
- Get those hands up.
- All right.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.707
Whoa.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.176
You look like a princess.

19:29.178 --> 19:30.961
You like it?

19:30.963 --> 19:33.463
It's from the Farrah Abraham collection.

19:33.465 --> 19:34.881
Who's Farrah Abraham?

19:34.883 --> 19:36.550
Teen mom, porn star.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.018
You'd recognize her.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.887
Don't run away again.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.222
I won't.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.690
Now we got a bunch to figure out.

19:43.692 --> 19:45.025
But no matter what, you and me

19:45.027 --> 19:46.693
are gonna throw a baller-ass wedding,

19:46.695 --> 19:48.361
raise up a baller-ass shorty,

19:48.363 --> 19:51.531
and have a baller-ass life.

19:51.533 --> 19:53.700
I think you just wrote our vows.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.704
I give them six months.

19:57.706 --> 19:58.905
I don't know.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.574
Maybe they'll surprise us.

20:00.576 --> 20:02.826
Now, let's bleed some green! Yeah.

20:02.828 --> 20:05.245
Come and get a... take a
little shower in this stuff!

20:05.247 --> 20:06.663
Or not.

20:06.665 --> 20:09.216
Let 'em start out with a fun party.

20:09.218 --> 20:10.834
Yeah.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.552
Hey, by the way,

20:12.554 --> 20:15.555
What we were talking about
earlier, if you tell anyone,

20:15.557 --> 20:16.840
I will staple your...

20:16.842 --> 20:20.427
It'll stay between friends.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.129
Thanks.

20:22.131 --> 20:23.380
Ear to the wall.

20:23.382 --> 20:26.049
You interrupted, but
that's what I'll staple.

20:26.051 --> 20:27.601
Just know that.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.390
Hey.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.115
Hey, Jonah.

20:45.571 --> 20:48.071
God, you are so funny.

20:49.575 --> 20:51.158
Oh, shoot.
