00:01.086 --> 00:03.086
(theme music)

00:05.461 --> 00:09.461
<i> A Merry Murdoch Christmas
was counted as eps </i>  9+10
<i>making this ep</i>  11 of 20

00:54.487 --> 00:58.624
Here, allow me.
Ah, thank you.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.362
They really should have picked
a better branch for Baby Day.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.164
Baby Day?
You open an account

01:05.166 --> 01:07.599
for your baby and they'll match
what you deposit up to $5.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.169
$5? That's a lot of money.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.539
There you are.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.974
Please, can I
have your attention?

01:15.976 --> 01:18.677
All mothers who are
here to open accounts, please,

01:18.679 --> 01:22.081
line up between the ropes
for the first available teller.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.316
If you are here
on another bank matter, please,

01:24.318 --> 01:29.021
speak to Miss Nolan, here.
Thank you for your patience.

01:31.291 --> 01:35.727
Hello. I'm Detective Murdoch.
I'm here to apply for a loan.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.397
I'm afraid our loan
clerk has an appointment.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.233
I'll have our Bank
Manager speak to you.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.869
Thank you.

01:43.871 --> 01:47.773
Detective Murdoch,
I'm John Mortimer.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.442
How can I help you?
I need you to sign

01:50.444 --> 01:52.845
for a receipt.
Yes, of course.

02:00.086 --> 02:04.323
Now, where were--
(babies crying loud)

02:04.325 --> 02:06.959
(with a little laugh): This has
been happening all morning.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.462
(laughing too): Each one sets
the other off, I suppose.

02:10.464 --> 02:14.266
Baby Day!
Not your idea, I take it?

02:14.268 --> 02:18.704
Only Head Office could dream
up something as ghastly as this.

02:18.706 --> 02:23.675
Let's step into my office,
we'll talk about your loan.

02:29.682 --> 02:33.752
My wife and I have been
living in a hotel suite.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.288
And you're looking
to buy a home.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.924
Build, actually. But...

02:38.926 --> 02:41.860
we both work very long
hours and have no time

02:41.862 --> 02:43.762
for household chores.
So you wish

02:43.764 --> 02:47.332
to include servant quarters.
Actually,

02:47.334 --> 02:51.270
the home I'm going to build
will do the chores for us.

02:53.506 --> 02:57.376
A... dish-washing
cupboard. Simply place

02:57.378 --> 03:01.480
the dirty dishes inside
and let the jets of hot water

03:01.482 --> 03:04.149
do the work for you.
Well it's...

03:04.151 --> 03:06.818
all very...
interesting.

03:06.820 --> 03:10.055
My pay stubs
for the past ten years.

03:10.057 --> 03:14.259
I have always been
gainfully employed.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.962
Now, I don't make
a King's Ransom,

03:16.964 --> 03:19.398
but I am far from
a profligate spender.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.833
(alarm sounding)

03:21.835 --> 03:24.436
The vault room
has been breached.

03:24.438 --> 03:27.406
Let's not panic. That will
only alarm the customers.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.007
But the thief
could be getting away.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.009
The exits
lock automatically

03:31.011 --> 03:35.013
as soon as the alarm
is activated. (deep breath)

03:35.015 --> 03:38.016
Automatic doors..?

03:41.688 --> 03:44.990
Shall I come with you?
No, stay here.

03:44.992 --> 03:48.627
Telephone the police from
my office and lock the doors.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.735
Excuse us, please.
But...

03:56.737 --> 03:59.004
what do you want me
to do with this?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.940
(sounds of alarm
and babies crying)

04:06.512 --> 04:09.781
Was anything taken?
I'll know in a moment.

04:13.353 --> 04:16.521
(end of alarm and sigh)

04:21.828 --> 04:25.330
Two bags missing.
$30 000.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.599
Oh dear, oh dear!

04:34.841 --> 04:37.609
all of which will have
to be searched. Why, oh why

04:37.611 --> 04:40.012
did this have
to happen on Baby Day?

04:40.014 --> 04:43.682
How much time do you think
elapsed from leaving your office

04:43.684 --> 04:47.185
to entering that staircase?
15, 20 seconds?

04:47.187 --> 04:49.621
I'm sorry?
Why didn't we encounter

04:49.623 --> 04:53.158
the thief on his way out?
He must have gone up

04:53.160 --> 04:56.862
the employee staircase.

05:16.549 --> 05:20.052
(babies crying)

05:21.220 --> 05:23.221
Has anyone else

05:23.223 --> 05:24.856
come through here?
No.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.126
Could I have
your attention, please!

05:28.128 --> 05:30.362
I... I regret to announce

05:30.364 --> 05:33.565
that we have had a...
a bit of a robbery!

05:33.567 --> 05:36.034
(vocal reactions)
Pardon me.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.772
As some of you
have noticed,

05:40.774 --> 05:42.708
the exit doors
are locked.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.510
This is purely
a security measure.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.512
They will be opened as soon as--
Hey!

05:47.514 --> 05:50.148
I've got
deliveries to make.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.950
As I said...

05:51.952 --> 05:54.119
Detective Murdoch,
perhaps you'd like to...

05:54.121 --> 05:56.221
The police will
be here shortly.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.891
The doors will remain locked
until we have searched

05:59.893 --> 06:02.861
and obtained statements
from everyone.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.530
You'd best put out
a sign telling customers

06:05.532 --> 06:08.500
the bank will be closed
for the remainder of the day.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.002
And let them in!

06:11.004 --> 06:14.806
Detective, my staff and I
are at your disposal.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.175
Thank you.
How did you

06:17.177 --> 06:20.712
get here before we did?
I was already here, sir.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.548
I was applying
for a loan.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.784
For the automatic house, sir?
A man's banking

06:25.786 --> 06:29.321
is his own business, Crabtree.
So what have we, Murdoch?

06:29.323 --> 06:31.890
$30 000 is missing
from the vault.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.626
But as the doors lock
when the alarm sounds,

06:34.628 --> 06:37.496
the thief and the money
are still inside the bank.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.197
Crikey, it's all
mothers and babies.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.167
How big is thirty thousand?
How big?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.969
What denominations?

06:43.971 --> 06:48.640
1000 each of tens and
twenties. Newly minted.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.909
So, roughly the size
of a shoe box.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.778
Sir, that could be hidden
in one of the prams.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.847
Yes, we'll have to search
them all, George. As well

06:55.849 --> 06:58.116
as the mothers.
I'll search the mothers.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.991
Julia. Thank you for coming.
The message said you wanted me

07:05.993 --> 07:08.827
to conduct a search of a mother?
Not just a mother,

07:08.829 --> 07:13.165
all of them.
And their prams.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.867
Oh my!

07:15.869 --> 07:17.969
Sir, if I may,

07:17.971 --> 07:20.672
Why are you wearing a scarf
in the middle of summer?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.774
Team colours. There's a
Wednesday match back in England,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.776
tomorrow. They're playing
for the league title.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.778
A Wednesday match
on a Tuesday?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.847
Sheffield Wednesday. It's
the name of the team, Murdoch.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.849
Ah, football.
Of course, football.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.452
Do I look
like a rugby man?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.320
So, it takes two
of you to open a door?

07:35.322 --> 07:37.522
Both keys must be turned
simultaneously or the alarm

07:37.524 --> 07:39.424
will sound.
That way a thief can't pick

07:39.426 --> 07:42.127
the lock without
setting off the alarm.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.798
Our lad picked
the lock then, did he?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.601
He must have.
I'm the only one

07:49.603 --> 07:52.370
with the key and it
never leaves my pocket.

07:52.372 --> 07:55.474
Bags of fours,
twos, and ones.

07:55.476 --> 07:59.211
He knew what
he was after.

07:59.213 --> 08:03.181
Sir, look at this.

08:05.318 --> 08:09.087
Water.
Where's it from?

08:09.089 --> 08:12.591
You think it's
connected to the robbery?

08:14.760 --> 08:18.296
Oh, how beautiful!
How old is he?

08:18.298 --> 08:20.232
Nine months.

08:20.234 --> 08:23.201
Still at that age when
they hold your gaze endlessly.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.837
Oh, only if he likes you.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.441
I'll need to check his pram.
Of course.

08:29.443 --> 08:32.210
Oh!

08:37.650 --> 08:39.284
Oh!

08:39.286 --> 08:41.686
Roland's just discovered
the joy of dropping things.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.123
Could you take him for a moment?
Oh, yes!

08:45.125 --> 08:48.226
Hello, Roland!

08:48.228 --> 08:51.463
Hello!

08:54.133 --> 08:56.935
He's taken a shine to you.

08:56.937 --> 09:01.072
Did you hear that, William?
He's taken a shine to me.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.909
How could he not?

09:03.911 --> 09:05.977
(little snicker)

09:07.713 --> 09:09.781
What's the nature of your
business here, Mr. Braxton?

09:09.783 --> 09:13.485
I was applying for a loan.
Open your jacket, please.

09:13.487 --> 09:16.154
Where were you
when the alarm sounded?

09:16.156 --> 09:17.956
With the Loan Clerk.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.692
Turn out your pockets
and pull your pants up tight.

09:20.694 --> 09:25.196
Is this your briefcase?
Yes.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.099
This is the last
of them, sir.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.669
Wednesday-ite, are you?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.604
You're from Sheffield?
Bugger Sheffield,

09:32.606 --> 09:34.205
I'm from Owlerton!

09:34.207 --> 09:36.007
The new stadium is down
the street from my house.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.643
(laughing): You must be
kicking yourself, lad.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.345
Black and blue.
If I'd known they'd be up

09:40.347 --> 09:42.480
for the championship I'd have
never left. Bloody kills me

09:42.482 --> 09:44.616
that I'm missing it.
Aye.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.918
Right then, sir.
You're free to go.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.554
Thank you.
Oh, I'll see you around, lad.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.524
Maybe for a pint.
Ah! Nice lad.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.926
Have you searched

09:54.928 --> 09:56.895
and obtained statements
from all of the customers?

09:56.897 --> 09:59.698
Yes, sir.
Right then,

09:59.700 --> 10:03.001
you can... let them go.

10:03.003 --> 10:06.171
Where's the money, Murdoch?
Well, sir, if it wasn't in one

10:06.173 --> 10:08.907
of the prams it must
still be on the premises.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.009
Where? And how did he
hide it without being seen?

10:11.011 --> 10:14.112
Perhaps it never
made it up here.

10:43.342 --> 10:47.779
Oh, thank God!

10:49.715 --> 10:51.850
(laughing): Thank God!
If I were you,

10:51.852 --> 10:53.852
I'd put that lot
straight in the safe.

10:53.854 --> 10:57.989
Yes. Yes. Right away,
of course! Thank you so much!

10:57.991 --> 11:00.458
The thief must have
stashed the money

11:00.460 --> 11:02.727
with the intention of collecting
it when the heat was off.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.497
Sirs, I've recovered
some baby toys.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.033
A couple of rattles,
a bonnet, a stuffed rabbit

11:08.035 --> 11:10.735
and a whistle
that doesn't work.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.470
Crabtree. What do you
want us to do with them?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.572
Nothing, sir. I just thought
I should bring them back down

11:14.574 --> 11:17.742
to the Station in case one the
mothers wanted to claim them.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.211
That's fine, George.
Crabtree.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.081
Detective! Inspector!

11:23.083 --> 11:25.884
Mr. Mortimer. You look
like you've seen a ghost!

11:25.886 --> 11:30.121
It wasn't the money they were
after. It was the plates.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.823
The plates?
I believe he's referring

11:31.825 --> 11:34.826
to the plates
used to print banknotes.

11:34.828 --> 11:38.263
They were in the safe.
I never thought to look!

11:38.265 --> 11:40.732
What are they worth?
Worth?

11:40.734 --> 11:44.069
As much as can
be printed. Millions!

11:44.071 --> 11:46.137
Bloody Hell.

11:53.145 --> 11:56.114
I started at the Trader's Bank
of Canada when I was 16.

11:56.116 --> 12:00.351
Worked my way up.
Not a blemish on my record.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.320
And now...

12:02.322 --> 12:04.189
If they were after the plates,
why steal the cash?

12:04.191 --> 12:07.158
A decoy. The thief likely
knew that we would search him,

12:07.160 --> 12:09.928
so he set us up to look
for the wrong thing.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.763
You think they were trying
to smuggled out the plates

12:11.765 --> 12:13.598
in one of the prams.
It would be an ideal way

12:13.600 --> 12:16.601
to both hide and
transport the plates.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.637
The thief likely chose
Baby Day on purpose.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.206
You realize he's not
the only one who's not

12:21.208 --> 12:24.576
looking so good in all this.
I'm aware, sir.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.544
We had the thief in
the bank, with the goods

12:26.546 --> 12:29.047
and we let him go. And you were
here the whole bloody time.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.116
I am AWARE, sir.
As will be

12:31.118 --> 12:34.152
Chief Constable Davis.

12:39.658 --> 12:42.694
Forty-seven seconds.
What?

12:42.696 --> 12:44.729
The time it took for us
to get down to the vault.

12:44.731 --> 12:48.032
I've timed the walk
down the stairs at 27 seconds,

12:48.034 --> 12:50.168
plus an extra 20 seconds
for the time it took us

12:50.170 --> 12:52.303
to actually start heading down.
Sir, don't take that

12:52.305 --> 12:55.640
too badly. I'm sure none of us
would have been much faster--

12:57.676 --> 13:00.278
The plates
were in the safe.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.347
So, how did he
break into the safe,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.516
steal the plates
and the money,

13:04.518 --> 13:07.519
all without being seen
in the time it took us

13:07.521 --> 13:10.421
to walk down the stairs?

13:10.423 --> 13:14.092
A cloak of invisibility.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.995
Don't be stupid, George.
That would render him invisible,

13:16.997 --> 13:19.697
not the plates.
Not if carried the plates

13:19.699 --> 13:21.933
under the cloak, Henry.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.869
It's not a
likely theory...

13:24.871 --> 13:27.739
The safe has a standard
rotary combination lock.

13:27.741 --> 13:31.309
An expert could crack it
in a matter of a few minutes,

13:31.311 --> 13:34.913
but how did he
do it in seconds?

13:34.915 --> 13:37.882
He might, if he knew
the combination.

13:40.619 --> 13:43.087
I'll be needing the
combination to the safe.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.824
Three turns to the right,
thirty five...

13:45.826 --> 13:48.927
Ten seconds.
Three turns to the left.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.429
Fifteen seconds.
Oh, sir!

13:51.431 --> 13:53.698
It would do
my concentration

13:53.700 --> 13:56.201
a great deal of good if you
did not read the time aloud.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.871
Oh! Alright, then.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.842
STARTING OVER!!
STARTING OVER!!

14:03.844 --> 14:06.845
I'm not deaf, Higgins. I
might be old, but I'm not deaf.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.681
Sorry, sir.
Go.

14:09.683 --> 14:13.051
Four turns to the left...

14:16.355 --> 14:19.457
Thirty seven. One turn...

14:25.397 --> 14:28.032
Get the plates.

14:31.136 --> 14:33.972
The money. Two bags.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.243
Oh sir. Do I stash the money?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.778
There's no time. Go!

14:44.950 --> 14:47.151
Hello!

14:50.122 --> 14:52.056
It took George 32 seconds
to open the safe.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.292
That means he couldn't have
gone up the main staircase

14:54.294 --> 14:56.494
without you seeing him.
He also didn't have time

14:56.496 --> 14:58.730
to stash the money
before heading upstairs.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.732
George barely
made it as it was.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.433
Then the thief must
have come downstairs after.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.769
How did he conceal
2 bags of money?

15:04.771 --> 15:06.571
Sir, if I remember correctly,
one of the customers

15:06.573 --> 15:10.008
did have a briefcase.
Nigel Braxton.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.943
The Wednesday-ite.
The Yorkshire fella.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.045
That's a good thought, George,
but I did see Mr. Braxton

15:14.047 --> 15:16.347
in the Loan Clerk's office
as the alarm sounded.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.417
He did tell us that, George.
So, we know the thief went up

15:19.419 --> 15:22.887
the employee staircase.
And that he knew the
combination to the safe.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.889
Impossible!
I'm afraid that's the only

15:24.891 --> 15:27.225
version of the events
that is not impossible.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.161
Now, who else besides you
has the combination to the safe?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.597
That's just it, no one!
And if you were

15:32.599 --> 15:35.433
run over by a train?
Head Office

15:35.435 --> 15:38.369
would have a copy, I suppose.
Who should we speak to

15:38.371 --> 15:40.805
at Head Office?
Mr. Bruce,

15:40.807 --> 15:43.341
Thornton Bruce.
He's the bank president.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.311
Mortimer!
That would be him now.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.980
A disaster.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.450
An outright disaster.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Bruce.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.352
I don't know how
it could have happened.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.487
We will have to engrave
new plates, obviously.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.091
But that will take weeks, weeks
during which the counterfeiters

16:00.093 --> 16:02.293
can flood the market with
printed notes that will be

16:02.295 --> 16:04.395
impossible to tell
from legitimate notes.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.632
And all this was conducted under
the noses of the city police.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.835
How do you explain that?
The thief had the combination

16:10.837 --> 16:14.005
to the safe, sir.
How do you explain that?

16:14.007 --> 16:16.975
I swear I've never
breathed it to another soul.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.711
Not even my dog.
All the combinations

16:19.713 --> 16:21.946
to the vaults are
in a safe in my office.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.149
And who has that combination?
The vice president,

16:25.151 --> 16:27.952
my secretary.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.955
No system is
foolproof, I suppose.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.957
So how do we
recover these plates?

16:32.959 --> 16:35.593
Well, if the thief
knew the combination,

16:35.595 --> 16:38.129
he would have had time
to steal the plates

16:38.131 --> 16:40.665
and escape up
the employee staircase.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.634
But not without
being seen by someone.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.272
I've placed all of the
customers in their stated

16:48.274 --> 16:51.709
positions when the alarm
sounded. Now, as you can see,

16:51.711 --> 16:53.945
most of the mothers were
here, in front of the tellers.

16:53.947 --> 16:57.048
Mr. Braxton was off
in the Loan Clerk's office.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.851
Mr. Lester was here.
The furniture mover?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.786
That's right.
Come on lads,

17:01.788 --> 17:04.022
it's not that heavy, let's go!
You got a sweat on, there,

17:04.024 --> 17:07.091
crack on!
O'Reilly, what are you doing?

17:07.093 --> 17:09.827
Wait! W-w-wait!
Uh, we can't move it

17:09.829 --> 17:12.430
any further, sir. The wires
are stapled to the baseboards.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.899
Well then, unstaple them.
Yes sir.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.368
What's all this?
The young lad at the bank

17:17.370 --> 17:20.204
got me thinking, Murdoch.
If I can't go to the game,

17:20.206 --> 17:23.775
the bloody game can come to me!
By telegraph?

17:23.777 --> 17:25.743
I have a pal who works
in a telegraph office

17:25.745 --> 17:28.012
back in Sheffield.
He's agreed to apprise me

17:28.014 --> 17:30.782
of the game's progress.
Sir, won't that be

17:30.784 --> 17:32.984
terribly expensive?
Well, the police department

17:32.986 --> 17:35.853
get a special rate. And I don't
have to pay for a telegrapher;

17:35.855 --> 17:37.855
there's no better dot
and dash man in the business

17:37.857 --> 17:40.725
than Jackson.
Thank you, sir.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.627
Sir, have you
considered the charge

17:42.629 --> 17:44.228
for a Trans-Atlantic signal?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.464
Can't be that expensive.
My sister telegraphs

17:46.466 --> 17:49.300
every Christmas. And she's
married to a bloody Scotsman.

17:49.302 --> 17:53.871
Well, best to check,
either way.

17:55.707 --> 17:59.143
Right then, George.
We know the thief

17:59.145 --> 18:01.379
came up this staircase

18:01.381 --> 18:05.750
and into the teller's cage one
minute after the alarm sounded.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.053
He would have emerged into
the lobby via this... door.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.623
Who are these people?
Joanne Perly,

18:12.625 --> 18:15.193
Nicole Henry, both mothers.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.996
Catherine Tweedale, head teller.
Why were you not

18:18.998 --> 18:21.065
lined up with
the rest of the mothers?

18:21.067 --> 18:23.968
Well, we were
penned in like cattle!

18:23.970 --> 18:26.437
Nicole is expecting
her second baby

18:26.439 --> 18:28.539
and it's not like
they didn't have chairs.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.775
They thought there
should be a number system.

18:30.777 --> 18:34.745
I didn't disagree.
Which way were you all facing?

18:34.747 --> 18:36.881
I was facing
the teller's cage.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.750
So you would have seen
someone come through

18:39.752 --> 18:42.553
and exit the teller's cage?
Absolutely!

18:42.555 --> 18:45.223
And did you?
The first person I saw

18:45.225 --> 18:48.092
come through that door,
after the alarm sounded,

18:48.094 --> 18:50.862
was you.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.133
Ready yourself, George!

18:55.135 --> 18:57.702
And.... GO!

18:57.704 --> 18:59.871
I-I-I don't understand.
If the thief

18:59.873 --> 19:02.306
didn't go up
the employee stairs...

19:02.308 --> 19:04.876
I believe he went up
the main stairs.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.845
Then why didn't we see him?
Because we were still

19:07.847 --> 19:10.815
in your office.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.486
Fifteen seconds.
Very good, George!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.288
Thank you sir.
I've actually been...

19:17.290 --> 19:21.926
taking strides to increase
my physical prowess. Good lord!

19:21.928 --> 19:23.728
That's not enough
time to open the safe.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.764
He didn't open the safe.
He didn't?

19:26.766 --> 19:29.167
No. The plates
were stolen earlier,

19:29.169 --> 19:33.004
possibly last night, as well
as the cash, in all likelihood.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.541
The person who triggered the
alarm was merely an accomplice.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.043
An accomplice?
Yes.

19:39.045 --> 19:42.313
The real thief was
upstairs discussing a loan...

19:42.315 --> 19:45.983
with me. You had
the keys to the vault,

19:45.985 --> 19:48.753
you knew the combination
to the safe;

19:48.755 --> 19:51.122
all you needed was for
someone to trigger the alarm.

19:51.124 --> 19:54.125
That's why we didn't rush
out of your office immediately

19:54.127 --> 19:56.994
after the alarm sounded.
Because you needed to delay

19:56.996 --> 19:59.363
just long enough
for your accomplice

19:59.365 --> 20:01.365
to make it all the way
back up the stairs

20:01.367 --> 20:03.467
before we headed down.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.336
No... But....

20:05.338 --> 20:07.538
Arrest him, George.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.474
(gasping): Oh!

20:10.476 --> 20:13.244
I didn't! I couldn't!
I wouldn't!

20:19.651 --> 20:21.786
Take him to the cells,
I'll interview him later.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.722
Good work, Murdoch.
How did you figure it out?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.524
Simple deduction, sir. It was

20:26.526 --> 20:28.926
the only logical
explanation remaining.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.895
When one has
eliminated the impossible,

20:30.897 --> 20:32.964
whatever remains
must be the truth.

20:32.966 --> 20:35.266
Sir. No telegraph
transmissions?

20:35.268 --> 20:37.702
Ten words for $2.
That's 20 cents a word.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.705
Sir, why not transmit
in code? Shorten it up a bit.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.040
PK could be a penalty kick.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.743
C for a corner,
G could stand for goal--

20:45.745 --> 20:48.379
I understand, Crabtree. There
is still a five-word minimum.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.681
Then share the cost. There
must be dozens of Yorkies

20:50.683 --> 20:53.751
in Toronto who would be willing
to pay for real-time results.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.054
Have Jackson call them out
as they come in,

20:57.056 --> 20:59.557
play by play,

20:59.559 --> 21:02.393
all coming from
a game 5000 miles away.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.695
You know, Crabtree,
you have some daft ideas,

21:04.697 --> 21:07.832
but this one's bloody brilliant.
Agreed.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.834
Detective Murdoch.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.136
Ah, Mr. Bruce!

21:12.138 --> 21:14.338
Heard you arrested my manager.
Indeed.

21:14.340 --> 21:17.475
We've determined the thief
could not have opened the safe,

21:17.477 --> 21:20.411
stolen the plates and returned
to the lobby without being seen.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.680
Therefore the plates must have
been removed BEFORE the alarm

21:22.682 --> 21:24.515
went off.
And the only person who could

21:24.517 --> 21:26.717
have done that...
Is the Branch Manager.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.086
And the alarm?
Set off by an accomplice

21:29.088 --> 21:32.590
to mask the earlier robbery.
What a shame.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.192
He showed such promise.
Really?

21:35.194 --> 21:37.928
He seemed a bit thick.
Baby Day was his idea.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.897
It was?
We knew nothing of it

21:39.899 --> 21:42.633
until we arrived this morning.
But what an idea.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.237
Customers for life for the cost
of a mere five dollars.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.342
It wasn't my idea. I got a
memorandum from head office

21:51.344 --> 21:54.378
saying the Traders Bank
was developing a strategy

21:54.380 --> 21:57.548
to encourage lifelong loyalty.
Sir,

21:57.550 --> 22:00.251
I have that file.
It will be

22:00.253 --> 22:03.454
the one dated August 16th.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.191
It certainly looks
like one of ours.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.894
That's it!
Do you have another memorandum

22:09.896 --> 22:11.796
to compare it to?
Of course.

22:11.798 --> 22:16.233
Hm... I sent
that one.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.777
Have a look at the letterhead.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.983
The letterhead
is lighter.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.386
It's a fake.
Sent by the thief

22:35.388 --> 22:37.488
to create a distraction,
I suppose.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.390
Why would he

22:39.392 --> 22:42.493
specifically require
mothers and their babies?

22:44.830 --> 22:47.131
(knocking)

22:47.133 --> 22:49.033
Thank you.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.936
Perhaps it wasn't
the Bank Manager.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.205
He's the only one it could be.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.242
Oh my.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.513
(sigh)

23:09.721 --> 23:12.189
What's all this?
Building blocks, sir.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.991
By drilling holes
and inserting dowels,

23:13.993 --> 23:17.094
the Detective has developed a
system by which building blocks

23:17.096 --> 23:18.996
can attach quickly,
and they won't let go.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.699
Look, they won't...
let go!

23:21.701 --> 23:23.667
I don't give a toss
about building blocks.

23:23.669 --> 23:26.370
I thought the case was solved.
The Bank Manager did it.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.406
But I'm no longer
confident in that assertion.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.208
We know the thief must
have had the combination

23:31.210 --> 23:33.611
to the safe. We know
there was insufficient time

23:33.613 --> 23:36.080
to make it up the main
staircase. If he'd gone up

23:36.082 --> 23:38.182
the employee staircase
he would have bumped

23:38.184 --> 23:40.751
into the three ladies,
here. Therefore,

23:40.753 --> 23:43.320
the plates were stolen
beforehand and the only one

23:43.322 --> 23:45.589
who could have done that
is the Bank Manager.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.658
What if...

23:49.394 --> 23:52.062
What if the thief was able
to get into the vault room

23:52.064 --> 23:54.365
without triggering the alarm?

23:54.367 --> 23:57.635
I thought it couldn't be done.
We haven't tried it.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.304
One unlocks the door,

24:00.306 --> 24:02.573
the other disengages the alarm.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.708
Now, both need to be
turned simultaneously

24:04.710 --> 24:08.179
or the alarm sounds.
On my mark, George.

24:08.181 --> 24:12.149
Ready, set, go.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.296
The device is an
electro-mechanical relay.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.731
When these contacts

24:27.733 --> 24:29.900
are touching, the alarm sounds.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.404
What keeps them apart is this
ratchet device. As you can see,

24:33.406 --> 24:37.208
both have to be
perfectly synchronized or...

24:37.210 --> 24:40.344
(Alarm goes off.)

24:46.017 --> 24:48.786
Right then.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.755
Let's try to
break in, George

25:28.693 --> 25:31.328
<i>What if there were</i>
<i>two thieves?</i>

25:31.330 --> 25:33.330
Both with keys.
The Loan Clerk

25:33.332 --> 25:35.733
keeps the alarm key. He could
have copied the other one.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.502
Yes. But they both would have
needed access to the safe.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.871
They could have
hired a safe cracker.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.207
Or Mr. Mortimer
is in on it,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.976
but that begs the same question:
why not simply walk out

25:45.978 --> 25:49.146
of the bank with
the plates? Why Baby Day?

25:49.148 --> 25:51.715
(chanting in the background)

25:51.717 --> 25:54.251
Come on (I hear "Pray up")
Wednesday, boys!

25:54.253 --> 25:56.921
Oy, Owlerton!
Bloody brilliant!

25:56.923 --> 25:59.924
I brought some mates.
Do we pay you before or after?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.892
Pay now. Jackson!
Sir?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.028
The game's about to start
in a few minutes. Get ready

26:04.030 --> 26:06.130
to man your station, Slugger.
Yes, sir.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.699
Right lads. Follow me.
Oh, and get your cash out.

26:08.701 --> 26:11.168
Come on Wednesday!

26:12.704 --> 26:15.673
Jackson. Here are the codes.
C stands for Crawshaw,

26:15.675 --> 26:18.242
D for Davis and so on.
2 means the word "to"

26:18.244 --> 26:20.844
unless it means the number 2.
Wait, what?

26:20.846 --> 26:23.547
Don't worry Jackson. Context
is everything. Just try to bring

26:23.549 --> 26:27.351
the game to life.
Remember: hearing is seeing.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.587
This is a fan sheet for
the team. Basic information

26:29.589 --> 26:32.856
on all the players.
Oy. It's past kick off.

26:32.858 --> 26:35.259
Come on, Jackson. Chop, chop.

26:38.096 --> 26:41.298
KO.
KO. Kick off, man.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.368
Right, uh, Kick off
for Sheffield.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.805
The Wednesday. The Wednesday.
The Wednesday.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.341
Crawshaw, two.

26:50.343 --> 26:53.210
Is that the number or the word?
Oh for God's sake, Jackson.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.580
Let me try. Crawshaw...
Crawshaw passes

26:56.582 --> 26:59.416
to Spiksley. Spiksley
moving forward now.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.353
That's very good, Crabtree.
OK, I can do this.

27:02.355 --> 27:05.956
I can do this
better. Crawshaw...

27:10.862 --> 27:13.631
George!

27:13.633 --> 27:17.001
He's with the inspector, sir.
Henry, have a look at this.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.236
If the teller

27:19.238 --> 27:21.639
had stepped out to speak
to these two mothers,

27:21.641 --> 27:24.942
she would be standing here,
facing towards the front door.

27:24.944 --> 27:28.045
If you say so, sir.
Yes.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.180
Bring them in, Henry.
All three of them.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.916
Right away.

27:32.918 --> 27:38.522
Crawshaw to Davis.
Intercepted.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.125
(reactions of despair)
Poor foot control has plagued

27:41.127 --> 27:43.193
Davis ever since
last year when he broke

27:43.195 --> 27:45.162
his ankle in a grudge
match against Leeds.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.731
Dirty Leeds.
(booing)

27:47.733 --> 27:50.768
The Wednesday
reclaims possession.
(happy reactions)

27:50.770 --> 27:53.671
Ruddlesdin... Holding....

27:53.673 --> 27:56.707
holding. To Wilson.

27:56.709 --> 28:00.244
Back to Ruddlesdin.
Header to Davis.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.281
Scores.
(acclamations)

28:10.255 --> 28:12.556
Hello, Henry.
The Detective will be

28:12.558 --> 28:14.925
a few minutes. He's
interviewing the mothers.

28:14.927 --> 28:18.028
I recognize you.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.165
It's Roland, isn't it?

28:21.167 --> 28:23.967
I don't know how
you tell them apart.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.503
They all look
the same to me.

28:26.505 --> 28:29.106
(loud talking and cheering)
What is going on in there?

28:29.108 --> 28:31.408
Sheffield
Wednesday supporters.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.378
They're listening to the game.
And bouncing!

28:34.380 --> 28:37.147
And bouncing!
(baby laugh)

28:37.149 --> 28:39.883
You were in
the teller's cage

28:39.885 --> 28:42.152
when a woman demanded
to speak with you.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.388
That was me.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.790
So you exited the
teller's cage and spoke

28:46.792 --> 28:49.159
to these two women.
Yes.

28:49.161 --> 28:52.362
Then, please explain
how you came to be facing

28:52.364 --> 28:55.499
the other way, toward
the teller cage door?

28:55.501 --> 28:57.568
I...

28:59.304 --> 29:02.439
The man... At the door.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.209
Yes, there was a man
at the door, peering through

29:05.211 --> 29:08.278
as if he couldn't get in.
This was before the alarm?

29:08.280 --> 29:11.915
Yes. So I went to the door,
but, by the time I got there,

29:11.917 --> 29:14.318
he'd left.
So I came back.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.321
That's how I ended up
facing the other way.

29:19.958 --> 29:23.060
Penalty kick for Watson.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.963
And Watson scores for
West Bromwich Albion.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.432
The score is now one-one.
Bollocks!

29:28.434 --> 29:30.801
That referee should never
have given that penalty.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.903
There you have it, Jackson.
Sheffield asked the question

29:32.905 --> 29:34.872
and it has been
soundly answered.

29:34.874 --> 29:38.275
The match has drawn even.
It doesn't say all
that, George.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.344
I'm trying to bring it to
life, Jackson. I'm trying to add

29:40.346 --> 29:43.113
a bit of... colour
to the commentary.

29:46.751 --> 29:49.186
They claim to remember
a man trying to get

29:49.188 --> 29:51.855
into the bank before
the alarm sounded.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.525
What's wrong with that?
Why was he unable

29:54.527 --> 29:57.027
to get into the bank?
The alarm hadn't gone off,

29:57.029 --> 29:59.229
the doors would
have been unlocked...

30:00.965 --> 30:03.400
unless the alarm
HAD gone off.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.102
But you would have
heard it, surely.

30:05.104 --> 30:08.372
Not if it was drowned out.

30:08.374 --> 30:12.976
Now, where were--
(babies crying loud)

30:12.978 --> 30:16.079
This has been
happening all morning.

30:16.081 --> 30:20.017
Each one sets
the other off, I suppose.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.553
Henry,

30:22.555 --> 30:24.955
where's that whistle that
George found at the bank?

30:24.957 --> 30:28.091
It doesn't work.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.532
(No sound comes out.)

30:35.534 --> 30:38.368
(All babies cry.)

30:42.740 --> 30:44.808
I know how
they did it.

30:54.452 --> 30:57.588
(loudly): I don't
hear a thing!

30:57.590 --> 31:00.424
Oh!
Ah!

31:00.426 --> 31:03.260
Good God! It sounds like
a highpitched fingernails

31:03.262 --> 31:05.562
on a blackboard.
I'd bloody cry myself

31:05.564 --> 31:07.998
if I heard that.
But how could the babies

31:08.000 --> 31:10.467
hear the whistle if we can't?
Hendrik Zwaardemaker,

31:10.469 --> 31:13.804
a Dutch scientist, discovered
a few years ago that babies

31:13.806 --> 31:17.074
and children can hear much
higher frequencies than adults.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.076
So the thief blew the
whistle just as he was about

31:19.078 --> 31:21.078
to enter the vault.
And the alarm sounded,

31:21.080 --> 31:23.380
but it was drowned out
by crying babies.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.550
He then opened the alarm box
and inserted a slip of paper

31:26.552 --> 31:28.185
between the contacts,
silencing the alarm.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.420
Then he cracked the safe
and removed the plates.

31:30.422 --> 31:33.323
Then removed the slip of
paper, setting the alarm
off once again.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.325
And he bolted up the main
staircase just before

31:35.327 --> 31:37.394
you turned the corner.
Why not leave the piece

31:37.396 --> 31:39.963
of paper between the contacts
and then, bolt out of the bank?

31:39.965 --> 31:42.432
Because the doors were still
locked from the first alarm.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.168
He wouldn't have been able to
leave. And he wouldn't have been

31:45.170 --> 31:47.838
able to account for his
whereabouts during the
window of opportunity.

31:47.840 --> 31:51.074
(from the game): Inspector!
Instead he was in the
lobby 15 seconds later

31:51.076 --> 31:53.810
when the alarm went off.
The second half is just

31:53.812 --> 31:57.214
about to start. So how
do we catch the bugger?

31:57.216 --> 31:59.116
Well,

31:59.118 --> 32:03.287
if he went up the stairs, then
he would have to run into...

32:03.289 --> 32:06.089
the furniture mover.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.826
Did you see anyone come up the
stairs after the alarm went off?

32:09.828 --> 32:13.463
Uh... the manager.
Before that, immediately

32:13.465 --> 32:16.800
after the alarm went off.
Uh, no.

32:16.802 --> 32:19.670
Well that's odd. Because
the thief had to come up

32:19.672 --> 32:22.005
the stairs after
the alarm sounded,

32:22.007 --> 32:24.574
and since you didn't see the
thief, the thief must be you.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.710
What?
As I recall,

32:26.712 --> 32:28.879
you were out of breath.
Of course I was.

32:28.881 --> 32:32.082
I was delivering chairs!
I do a dozen of these deliveries

32:32.084 --> 32:33.984
every day. You think because
I'm delivering to a bank

32:33.986 --> 32:36.620
that I'm suddenly
gonna up and rob it?

32:45.196 --> 32:48.765
Who ordered the chairs?
Head Office, of course.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.501
It's their new
"Customer is King" policy.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.404
The chairs are
for our clients.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.708
I see.

32:59.544 --> 33:02.179
This is another
fake memorandum.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.051
(sighing):Do you think this is
the work of the furniture mover?

33:08.053 --> 33:11.221
If so, why this? Why not
simply walk into the bank

33:11.223 --> 33:15.392
blow the whistle and steal the
plates? Why bring in a chair?

33:15.394 --> 33:18.095
I... I don't know.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.696
To smuggle the plates?

33:19.698 --> 33:23.066
But then the chairs
are still here.

33:23.068 --> 33:25.802
Unless...

33:38.616 --> 33:41.051
(The bank manager gasps.)

33:41.053 --> 33:44.388
A Trojan horse.
Where's the other chair?

33:44.390 --> 33:46.923
It's in the Loan
Clerk's office.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.098
(gasping): Oh my God, oh my God!

33:55.100 --> 33:57.467
They're here.
You've found them!

33:57.469 --> 34:01.171
I've got to call Mr. Bruce.
I have to put them in the safe!

34:01.173 --> 34:04.074
No. We should leave them.
What?

34:04.076 --> 34:07.778
Who else had access to this
office during the robbery?

34:07.780 --> 34:10.981
No one. I locked the door
after the alarm went off.

34:10.983 --> 34:12.949
But there was
someone in this office.

34:12.951 --> 34:15.185
Mr. Braxton. He was
here about a loan.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.721
But it couldn't have been him.
He was sitting in the office

34:17.723 --> 34:19.990
when the alarm went off.

34:33.571 --> 34:37.507
Wilson to Ruddleson.
Ruddleson back to Wilson.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.844
Wilson driving
forward. SCORES!!!

34:45.349 --> 34:47.818
Wilson said he wanted
to send a message to the fans.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.654
last month, I guess he had a
different message for West Brom.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.956
Either way, I think it's
safe to say: message sent,

34:52.958 --> 34:55.225
message received. Two to one
for the Sheffield Wednesday,

34:55.227 --> 34:57.427
with a mere ten minutes
left on the clock.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.030
West Brom with the kick off.
(knocking at the door)

35:00.032 --> 35:01.398
Yup.

35:01.400 --> 35:05.936
Painter to Havelock. Holds it.
We're a goal ahead

35:05.938 --> 35:08.138
with about ten minutes
remaining. Can't this wait?

35:08.140 --> 35:11.074
Sir, we've recovered
the plates and I believe

35:11.076 --> 35:14.411
I know who the thief is.
Really? So who is it?

35:14.413 --> 35:17.581
Nigel Braxton.
The little Yorkie?

35:17.583 --> 35:19.282
But he's bouncing
away in my office.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.452
Sir, I believe he stashed
the plates inside of a chair

35:22.454 --> 35:24.754
in the Loan Clerk's
office. The only person

35:24.756 --> 35:26.923
who could have done
that is Nigel Braxton.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.993
But you said he was in the
office when the alarm went off.

35:29.995 --> 35:33.096
The thief placed a piece
of ice between the contacts

35:33.098 --> 35:35.899
inside of the alarm. That's why
we found water on the floor

35:35.901 --> 35:37.934
inside the vault.
I thought water

35:37.936 --> 35:39.936
conducts electricity.
Well, the dissolved minerals

35:39.938 --> 35:43.440
in water conduct. But
distilled water is an insulator.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.876
So when the ice melts...

35:45.878 --> 35:48.578
...the contacts touch
and the alarm sounds.

35:48.580 --> 35:53.416
<i>But by then Braxton was safey</i>
<i>in the Loan Clerk's office.</i>

35:53.418 --> 35:55.919
<i>When the alarm sounded,</i>

35:55.921 --> 35:58.488
<i>I believe Braxton used</i>
<i>the distraction to transfer</i>

35:58.490 --> 36:02.125
<i>the plates from his bag to the</i>
<i>secret compartment of the chair.</i>

36:07.865 --> 36:10.033
Now if I'm not mistaken,
Mr. Braxton will be returning

36:10.035 --> 36:12.669
to the bank to retrieve
those plates, soon.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.671
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.541
Sir. We need to
catch him red handed.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.643
Give no indication
that you know.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.646
Ah. I'll be keeping
an eye on him all the same.

36:24.549 --> 36:27.918
To Ruddlesdin. Ahead to Davis.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.553
He's got room!

36:29.555 --> 36:31.888
The little bugger's gone.
He must have slipped out

36:31.890 --> 36:34.024
the side door. Do you
think he's on to us?

36:34.026 --> 36:36.293
That or he's returned to the
bank to retrieve the plates now.

36:36.295 --> 36:39.162
We need to make a move.
Let's get to the armory.

36:39.164 --> 36:41.331
I'll get George.
No, no, no. Leave him be.

36:41.333 --> 36:45.101
The boy's a natural. And
the lads have paid good money.

36:47.305 --> 36:49.906
Goal!
(cheering)

36:51.642 --> 36:53.877
Aw, Go and tell him

36:53.879 --> 36:56.012
to stop looking at the bloody
peephole, Murdoch.

36:56.014 --> 36:59.349
(from inside):
Thank you for seeing me!

36:59.351 --> 37:03.220
Too late.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.657
I need to see
the Loan Clerk.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.593
I'm afraid he's
busy at the moment.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.595
It'll just take
a second. I just

37:11.597 --> 37:14.030
have to ask him
a very quick question.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.900
(baby cooing)

37:16.902 --> 37:19.236
Thank you.

37:22.406 --> 37:26.843
Oh, OK. Excuse me,
Mr. Braxton.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.079
No a problem. Take your time.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.694
Gotcha.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.638
I'm sorry. I've just realized
I have to be somewhere.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.040
Where would that
be, Mr. Braxton?

37:57.042 --> 37:59.743
Let's have a look
in that satchel, shall we?

38:03.314 --> 38:06.049
(cocking the gun): Let him go!

38:06.051 --> 38:08.752
Sorry, gentlemen.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.554
Another day... perhaps?

38:11.556 --> 38:14.291
You made me miss
the end of the match.

38:14.293 --> 38:17.027
(cocking): I've half a mind
to shoot you on principle.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.995
(Murdoch cocking)

38:18.997 --> 38:21.164
I'm afraid you're
outgunned, Mrs. Perly.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.166
(baby cooing)

38:23.168 --> 38:26.503
Let us leave or I'll
blow her head off.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.938
Take the pram
and back out slowly.

38:28.940 --> 38:32.142
Nigel, get behind me.
Thanks angel.

38:32.144 --> 38:35.512
While I'm at it, why don't I
flag us down a motorcar?

38:35.514 --> 38:39.282
Make it a fast one. Come on!

38:39.284 --> 38:42.686
Please wait! Excuse me ladies,
sorry. One minute, please, sir.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.256
Got to-Get out
of the bloody car! Now!

38:46.258 --> 38:49.059
(grunting)

38:51.262 --> 38:53.563
Mrs. Perly,

38:53.565 --> 38:56.166
put down the gun.
It's not too late,

38:56.168 --> 38:59.436
no one's been hurt.
Come on, angel!

38:59.438 --> 39:02.372
Time's a-wasting!
(Honks the horn.)

39:02.374 --> 39:05.041
(baby cooing and teller moaning)

39:05.043 --> 39:07.544
Bye bye.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.048
(yelping)

39:16.454 --> 39:19.589
No!

39:28.999 --> 39:31.634
(soft moan)

39:36.407 --> 39:38.908
(groans of effort)

39:54.158 --> 39:56.259
(gunshot)
Ooh!

39:56.261 --> 39:59.229
(moan)

39:59.231 --> 40:02.399
(gunshot)

40:02.401 --> 40:04.267
Ugh!

40:04.269 --> 40:06.970
(grunt)

40:12.276 --> 40:16.379
(birds chirping and voices)

40:16.381 --> 40:18.782
(baby crying)

40:32.496 --> 40:35.265
I didn't take you
for a patriot, Inspector

40:35.267 --> 40:37.233
Patriot?
Your tattoo sir.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.136
1867. The birth
of Canada.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.672
(laughing): Sob Canada.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.908
1867 is the birth
of the Wednesday;

40:44.910 --> 40:47.877
Sheffield Wednesday football
club. My uncle was one

40:47.879 --> 40:49.612
of the founding
committee members.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.081
Bloody hell. I forgot
to ask about the game.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.217
We broke even, sir.
May have even turned

40:54.219 --> 40:56.653
a bit of a profit.
I meant the score, Crabtree.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.956
The end score: Three to one
for the Sheffield Wednesday.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.425
Champions of England;

41:02.427 --> 41:04.160
I should be happier.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.029
Well, sir,
you have been shot.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.832
Two people are dead and
a child has been orphaned.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.167
(sighing): Thank you, doctor.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.003
I'm gonna get another drink.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.440
(baby cooing)
What will happen to him?

41:17.442 --> 41:20.009
A woman from
the local orphanage

41:20.011 --> 41:23.012
will be by to take him until
we can find his next of kin.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.448
I believe she's here now, sir.
Oh, right.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.150
Please let her in, George.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.519
I will do. By the way,
sir, we received a telegram

41:29.521 --> 41:32.021
from Scotland Yard. Apparently
Nigel Braxton is wanted

41:32.023 --> 41:34.157
in England for a whole
slew of bank robberies.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.925
And Mrs. Perly?
That's her maiden name.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.261
Originally hails
from Stratford, Ontario.

41:38.263 --> 41:41.331
Next of kin?
None, sir.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.834
Neither of them?

41:44.836 --> 41:47.637
(baby cooing)

41:47.639 --> 41:50.740
I want to adopt him.
What?

41:50.742 --> 41:52.375
Julia!

41:52.377 --> 41:56.012
He's an orphan, William.
He has no other home.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.482
Y-Yes, but. We don't
know anything about him!

41:59.484 --> 42:03.152
All we do know is he's the
progeny of two bank robbers.

42:03.154 --> 42:06.022
William. Criminality
is not heritable;

42:06.024 --> 42:09.492
you yourself are hardly
your father's son.

42:11.762 --> 42:14.397
He took a shine to me, William.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.666
I think in some way,

42:16.668 --> 42:20.837
this might be meant to be.
You've always wanted children.

42:20.839 --> 42:23.740
Yes, but not this way.

42:23.742 --> 42:26.242
Then how?

42:28.045 --> 42:30.079
I'm from the Hamley
House for Orphans.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.448
Yes. Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

42:32.450 --> 42:35.451
Detective William Murdoch,
my wife, Doctor Julia Ogden.

42:35.453 --> 42:38.087
Will he be adopted?
We'll do our best, ma'am.

42:41.692 --> 42:44.294
He doesn't seem
to want to go.

42:44.296 --> 42:46.963
I'll take him.

42:46.965 --> 42:50.300
Actually, I...
"We".

42:50.302 --> 42:54.404
I would-"We" would
like to adopt him.

42:56.407 --> 43:00.076
We've discussed it. And
I believe we are in agreement.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.014
It's most unusual.
Are you certain?

43:05.016 --> 43:08.084
We are.
We are.

43:08.086 --> 43:12.488
Then I'll drop off
the papers. Good day!

43:16.594 --> 43:19.195
What have we done?

43:19.197 --> 43:22.131
Hopefully, the right thing.

43:22.133 --> 43:25.001
(baby and Julia laughing)

43:32.843 --> 43:35.812
(theme music)
