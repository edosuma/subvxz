15:34.183 --> 15:36.435
You knew Cooper and I were
in a fragile place,

15:36.518 --> 15:39.688
and you made a move on my husband
without even checking with me.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.275
You asked for my help.
You came to that party of your own accord.

15:43.359 --> 15:47.488
Your husband told me to do what I did.
It tasted like he enjoyed it.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.575
That was a onetime mistake.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.788
Don't you ever touch my husband again.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.669
I thought
you wanted something more, Billie.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.588
All your talk of sex and freedom.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.509
Instead, you made a very public problem
at a very private party.

16:08.592 --> 16:12.721
I know, and I'm sorry,
but that's what it took for me to realize

16:12.805 --> 16:15.683
I don't want what you and Devon have.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.019
I don't want my husband fantasizing
about somebody else,

16:19.103 --> 16:21.146
let alone acting on those fantasies.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.066
So you're gonna go back
to being Little Miss Happy Homemaker?

16:24.149 --> 16:27.152
No. In fact,
I probably should get back to work.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.696
Right, to keep you distracted

16:28.779 --> 16:32.116
from the fact that your deepest
feminine desires are utterly unfulfilled.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.325
That's not true.

16:34.493 --> 16:38.914
There are a lot of ways to be feminine,
a lot of different desires.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.001
Fine. You can tell yourself
that'll be enough.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.586
But I know it won't be.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.215
Guess what. Your husband knows too.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.260
Cooper and I are working things out.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.304
You might be trying to,
but I'm not sure Cooper is.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.974
He seemed pretty done with you to me.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.477
[door slams]

17:01.645 --> 17:02.688
[knocking on door]

17:04.857 --> 17:07.526
-Can I talk to you for a sec?
-Yeah, sure.

17:15.909 --> 17:20.039
I lied before.
I'm not into residential hydropower.

17:20.622 --> 17:24.710
And let me guess.
Devon didn't get jumped in Greenwich.

17:25.794 --> 17:26.628
No.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.381
That was me.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.886
What are you talking about?

17:33.969 --> 17:36.638
Billie and I were trying
to spice things up.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.932
And so we...

17:40.100 --> 17:43.187
We let Devon and Trina take us to, um...

17:45.898 --> 17:48.901
to a party, and things got out of control.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.360
I...

17:51.236 --> 17:54.364
I did things with Trina...

17:55.574 --> 17:57.910
and Devon tried to get with Billie...

18:01.789 --> 18:03.040
and I lost it.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.253
I cannot imagine you doing any of this.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.256
That's not the Cooper Connelly I know.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.801
It's not the Cooper Connelly
that I know either.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.181
Um...

18:22.893 --> 18:25.020
I have to take this to HR.

18:25.687 --> 18:29.483
Despite the fact that
the incident occurred outside of work,

18:29.566 --> 18:32.277
it was still a physical altercation
between two employees.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.195
I know.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.489
I can't let my feelings get in the way.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.407
I understand that, and I'm...

18:38.408 --> 18:39.284
I'm so sorry.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.286
No, I'm sorry for you.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.290
When are you gonna leave her?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.337
-Francesca...
-She's destroying you.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.928
I told you how you rescued me.
Now it's my turn.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.143
This is a key to my apartment.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.021
It's a safe haven. Maybe a fresh start.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.486
You don't ever have to go home again.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.879
[dramatic music playing]

19:50.898 --> 19:51.982
Mommy?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.361
Hi, honey.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.239
Oh, look at you!

19:59.740 --> 20:01.116
What's a divorce?

20:03.577 --> 20:05.204
Where'd you hear that word?

20:05.287 --> 20:08.790
Hannah said her mom said
you and Daddy are getting a divorce.

20:10.459 --> 20:14.129
That's not happening. Okay? It's...

20:16.256 --> 20:18.967
It's not true. I promise.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.345
[door opens, then closes]

20:21.428 --> 20:23.597
Hey, hey. Aunty Sasha's back.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.018
-Almost time for you guys to go, right?
-[Hudson] Daddy's not home.

20:28.101 --> 20:31.647
Oh, he's coming. I'm sure he's on his way.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.649
We can't make France without Daddy.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.819
We're gonna be fine, honey. We've got...

20:38.987 --> 20:42.866
We have passports, we have brie.
Everything's gonna be great.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.579
Hey, Huddy.

20:48.580 --> 20:53.335
Why don't we go check on Ellary?
What do you say? Yeah? Okay.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.463
Go, go, go. I'll race you.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.884
[dramatic music playing]

21:02.261 --> 21:03.929
[cell phone ringing]

21:10.602 --> 21:12.312
[voicemail] You've reached
Cooper Connelly.

21:12.396 --> 21:17.442
Sorry I'm not available to take your call.
Leave a message. I'll speak with you soon.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.611
-[voicemail beeps]
-Cooper, where are you?

21:20.153 --> 21:24.116
I know you're angry,
but it's Hudson's International Fair.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.701
Don't do this to him.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.997
Don't do this to us.

21:30.914 --> 21:34.543
Just... Just call me. Please.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.094
[elevator dings]

21:50.183 --> 21:51.518
Thanks for seeing me.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.151
You want a drink?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.906
Yeah. Sure.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.452
So this is, uh...

22:53.246 --> 22:54.456
your place, huh?

22:57.334 --> 22:58.543
This is where you lived...

23:00.379 --> 23:01.463
together.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.635
-Yeah.
-Look...

23:09.221 --> 23:11.390
I know there's something going on
between you.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.438
She's in love with you.
Always has been, always will be.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.815
-Cooper--
-Just stop.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.786
I just need to know...

23:37.416 --> 23:39.209
Is this real for you too?

23:42.671 --> 23:44.089
Okay, if I walk away,

23:45.924 --> 23:47.551
will you take care of her?

23:49.928 --> 23:52.973
It's not just her. Okay? It's my kids too.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.394
They'll be a part of your life,
they'll have to be.

24:01.273 --> 24:07.028
And I will not walk away unless I know
that they're all gonna be okay.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.162
It is real.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.668
I am undeniably in love with your wife.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.422
And I would do anything...

24:27.132 --> 24:28.550
lay down my life...

24:30.343 --> 24:32.679
to be the father
of her children and yours.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.103
But she won't have me.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.232
Oh, bullshit.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.235
She said no.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.073
And trust me, I tried.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.954
I even brought her a ring,
asked her to marry me.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.418
She said no this whole time.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.129
'Cause that's who she is.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.716
That's who you're married to.

25:12.427 --> 25:13.303
Is it?

25:15.931 --> 25:19.851
'Cause I'm not sure
that I even know who I'm married to.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.611
You know, you were right.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.531
At dinner.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.371
There is a reason
why she never mentioned you.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.627
'Cause she was hiding herself because...

25:48.296 --> 25:53.426
I think, deep down,
she does want a life that is...

25:55.637 --> 26:00.308
That is-- That is wilder and bigger...

26:01.768 --> 26:03.019
than just me.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.730
Wrong, mate.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.652
-She's all about you.
-Yeah, yeah, for now.

26:12.195 --> 26:13.029
Maybe.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.742
But we both know...

26:19.661 --> 26:20.996
whatever I can offer--

26:21.079 --> 26:24.165
It's everything she's ever wanted.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.459
[tender music playing]

26:32.716 --> 26:35.969
Kids, a husband who would never run away.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.225
Everything I was too chickenshit
to give her.

26:44.561 --> 26:48.106
You can only run around
having crazy adventures for so long.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.820
At the end of the day,
Billie really wanted me to be...

26:57.490 --> 26:58.325
you.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.000
So the real question isn't,
"Am I gonna take care of her?"

27:13.131 --> 27:14.716
The question is, "Are you?"

27:47.082 --> 27:50.085
-[upbeat music playing over speakers]
-[indistinct chatter]

28:05.350 --> 28:06.726
Oh, nope. Nope.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.234
No one wants it.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.698
That's okay, honey. You know, um...

28:21.491 --> 28:23.076
Maybe they're just full.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.372
Why don't you go check out Japan?
They have salmon sushi.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.291
Your favorite, right? Yeah? Go on.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.842
Hannah, why don't you go find your father?

28:38.925 --> 28:41.720
All the daddies are bringing in
the drinks.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.139
At least, all the daddies who came.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.473
Okay, that's enough.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.768
Whatever your inner nun is telling you,

28:48.852 --> 28:51.938
dissing a 4-year-old is not
the appropriate response.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.898
Billie, you need to back off.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.692
Caroline is not your problem.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.194
Yeah. It's not her fault
your husband isn't here.

28:58.278 --> 29:01.489
-Cooper got tied up at work.
-Devon said he left two hours ago.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.450
[dramatic music playing]

29:03.533 --> 29:06.661
Look, Billie,
I'm sorry about what's happening.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.705
You have no idea what's happening.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.458
I know that you're questioning
a lot of things

29:11.541 --> 29:14.210
that most women here
simply accept as canon,

29:14.294 --> 29:17.422
and honestly,
a part of me admires you for that.

29:17.505 --> 29:19.674
Not sure what there is to admire.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.218
But it's also scaring people

29:22.302 --> 29:26.014
because it's making them wonder
what they might be settling for too.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.850
I'm not settling, Judy.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.143
I love my life!

29:30.226 --> 29:33.271
Do you?
Then why are you so afraid to question it?

29:33.354 --> 29:35.732
Maybe it's okay to admit
that the happily-ever-after

29:35.815 --> 29:38.860
never turned out
to be so deliriously happy after all.

29:38.943 --> 29:43.740
I am! Deliriously happy. Seriously.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.867
It's not like Trina's
the first married woman

29:45.950 --> 29:47.660
who ever wanted to go to a sex party.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.870
Excuse me?

29:48.953 --> 29:51.915
What do you think would have happened
if your old boyfriend hadn't turned out

29:51.998 --> 29:55.168
to be bald, fat
and in the concrete business?

29:55.710 --> 29:58.546
You're right.
I don't know where Cooper is.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.923
I don't know where we are,

30:00.006 --> 30:02.717
but I do know
that I am trying to live my life

30:02.801 --> 30:06.137
with open eyes and an open heart,
and it is messy,

30:06.221 --> 30:11.267
and it's joyful,
and it is soul-crushing and necessary.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.813
Oh, please.
Spare us the lecture and just admit

30:14.896 --> 30:18.274
that you're dying to go back to spreading
your legs on the Lower East Side.

30:18.358 --> 30:22.529
Hey. You leave her alone, okay?
You are in no position to judge.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.072
Back off, Boy Scout.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.575
I am so sick of Good Guy Connelly.
You're no saint, buddy.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.162
At least I'm willing
to take responsibility for what I did.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.499
To everyone.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.711
If you're gonna hand out apologies,
start with me.

30:38.795 --> 30:42.382
No. She deserves it.
And a whole hell of a lot more.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.844
Spoken like
the pussy-whipped pussy you are.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.180
You're really gonna do this here?

30:49.264 --> 30:51.558
-You let her run all over you...
-Real classy, Dev.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.810
...and you're too weak
to shut that crazy down.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.562
Don't talk about Billie like that.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.773
Yes, we've had our problems.
We're working it out.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.567
That's called marriage.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.946
This right here, this is the real world.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.783
Okay? I don't know
what world you all are living in.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.293
You say what you want,
but Billie's a good woman.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.045
And she is a great mother.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.968
And I love her with everything that I got.

31:30.471 --> 31:34.684
Daddy. Italy has gelato.
That's ice cream, right?

31:35.518 --> 31:39.856
Hey, buddy, guess what. I know
where they got the best ice cream in town.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.691
Come here.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.194
Let's get out of here.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.056
I lost the partnership.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.728
I may lose my job.

32:19.687 --> 32:20.772
[clears throat]

32:20.855 --> 32:22.941
HR still needs to speak with Devon.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.320
After what just went down,
I'm sure he'll do his worst.

32:27.403 --> 32:28.529
Oh, honey.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.366
I am so sorry.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.077
I know you worked so hard.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.583
[Cooper clears throat]

32:42.293 --> 32:43.670
I went to see him.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.673
Brad.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.258
I know he was at the house.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.929
He showed up.

32:53.805 --> 32:54.806
I sent him away.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.351
I didn't mention it
because there was no reason to.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.103
I was never going back to him.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.898
If I'd have told you
that he came, that he...

33:04.941 --> 33:06.234
proposed to me...

33:07.819 --> 33:10.738
-you'd have left, and you know it.
-I don't know anything.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.700
All I do know is that if we have
any chance of making it,
