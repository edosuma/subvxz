Cousin, what’s a six letter word
for, "Do over?"

01:32.225 --> 01:33.126
Repeat.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.629
What’s a six‐letter word
for, "Do over?"

01:35.662 --> 01:36.830
Repeat.

01:36.863 --> 01:38.799
What’s a six‐letter word
for, "Do over?"

01:38.832 --> 01:41.702
Repeat. The word is "Repeat."

01:43.737 --> 01:46.272
Well, love me tender
and call me Elvis.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.676
Why you didn’t say so
in the first place?

01:50.877 --> 01:52.245
Appleton.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.914
Have you got that
racketeering story ready?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.116
Yes, yes, sir,
I just finished it, sir.

01:57.483 --> 01:58.484
There you are.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.356
Bunky?

02:03.389 --> 02:06.827
Bunky McDermott. Bunkster,
it’s me, the Appleman.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.429
Larry Appleton.
It’s been a long time.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.598
‐You’re lookin’ good.
‐Well, so are you.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.766
You, you haven’t changed a bit.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.635
You just look...richer.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.670
[chuckles]

02:16.703 --> 02:18.739
Well, how is everything going?

02:18.772 --> 02:21.808
Well, I have a penthouse
in New York, a villa in Capri

02:21.842 --> 02:24.578
and a castle in Spain.
What do you think?

02:24.611 --> 02:27.213
I think it must be tough
for you to run home for lunch.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.884
This is my cousin, Balki.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.819
Balki, Bunky. Bunky, Balki.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.854
‐Balki.
‐Bunky.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.726
Nice work, Appleton.
You may win a Pulitzer yet.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.595
Bunky, it’s been a pleasure.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.297
A Pulitzer, say.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.299
Appleton,
that’s very impressive.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.569
You’ve come a long way
since high school.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.436
Well, we had some good times,
didn’t we?

02:50.470 --> 02:52.405
[chuckles]
Remember the time

02:52.438 --> 02:54.908
a bunch of us
were going to the dance

02:54.941 --> 02:57.544
and we pretended we’d
run out of gas and we made that

02:57.578 --> 03:00.847
poor sap go back and get some,
and then we drove off?

03:00.881 --> 03:03.416
[chuckles]

03:03.449 --> 03:04.450
Yeah, that was me.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.488
Oh, I must have been
thinking of that nerd

03:08.522 --> 03:10.624
whose books
we always glued together.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.393
Uh, me again.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.864
Cousin, I’m confused,
were you the sap or the nerd?

03:19.766 --> 03:21.835
No, I was the sap.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.738
We did some pretty cruel things
to you in high school, Larry.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.807
I’m really sorry about that.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.341
Well, that’s okay.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.776
I, I guess everybody does some

03:29.810 --> 03:31.512
stupid things
when they’re young.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.478
Boy, tell me about it.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.715
Back on Mypos
there was this group of kids

03:34.748 --> 03:35.916
who used to crow like a rooster

03:35.949 --> 03:37.718
and get the hens all excited.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.391
Say, Mr. Pulitzer,
The Beekman Club’s giving a

03:45.425 --> 03:48.595
little formal
dinner dance on Saturday.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.697
Why don’t you come as my guest?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.599
‐The Beekman Club?
‐Yeah.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.900
Oh, you’ll feel right at home.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.869
All the old gang are members.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.771
You mean Muffy, Buffy, Fluffy?

03:57.804 --> 03:59.506
[chuckles]
And Biff, Cliff and Griff!

04:00.874 --> 04:01.942
Sounds terriff!

04:04.310 --> 04:05.679
Boy, you guys
are taking me back.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.715
I’m remembering my old gang
back on Mypos.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.818
Clinki, Blinki, Dinki.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.987
Manny, Moe, and Jack.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.692
I love this guy!

04:19.726 --> 04:21.293
You gotta bring him along.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.863
Okay, dinner’s at nine.

04:26.499 --> 04:29.703
Well, Balki, this is great!

04:29.736 --> 04:30.804
This is something I’ve been

04:30.837 --> 04:31.905
dreaming about
since high school.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.807
Cousin, you’ve eaten out before.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.512
No, I, I mean, this is,
this is a chance for me finally

04:38.545 --> 04:40.747
to be, uh, accepted by Bunky.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.882
I mean, back in high school

04:41.915 --> 04:43.784
everybody wanted to be in
Bunky’s crowd.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.319
They were the smartest,
the best looking...

04:46.352 --> 04:47.621
...the most popular.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.322
They had the most fun.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.558
And next week,
when I go to that party

04:51.592 --> 04:53.326
and walk in
with Jennifer on my arm

04:53.359 --> 04:55.361
Bunky’ll see that
I am, Larry Appleton

04:55.395 --> 04:57.330
ace reporter
for the Chicago Chronicle.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.733
He’ll beg me to be
a member of that club.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.902
Oh, it’ll be Buffy,
Muffy, Fluffy

05:01.935 --> 05:04.004
Biff, Cliff, Griff, and Larry.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.641
Well, Cousin, that sounds great.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.076
It sounds like you’re gonna
have a wonderful time.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.013
No, we’ll have a wonderful time,
he invited you, too.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.114
Well, Cousin,
I can’t possibly go.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.050
Next Saturday night is
the Star Search semifinals.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.555
Balki, he invited you.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.389
Bunky asked me to
bring you along.

05:23.423 --> 05:24.925
You don’t say no
to Bunky McDermott.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.493
I’m not, I’m saying no to,
Cousin McLarry.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.666
Alright. Alright, you’re right.

05:32.699 --> 05:35.569
There’s absolutely
no reason for you to go.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.637
Well, you’re right.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.672
‐You won’t know anyone there.
‐That’s right.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.406
‐You’ll be bored.
‐That’s right.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.776
You can meet Wayne Newton
some other time.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.388
[chuckles]

05:55.421 --> 05:58.725
Uh, Cousin, uh,
did‐did you say that, uh

05:58.759 --> 06:00.493
Wayne Newton was
going to be there?

06:01.628 --> 06:03.930
Of course.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.432
Funny, Bunky, uh, didn’t say

06:06.466 --> 06:09.035
that Wayne Newton
was going to be there.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.504
Well, who do you think
Fluffy is?

06:16.142 --> 06:17.477
[instrumental music]

06:22.015 --> 06:26.486
Okay, now, we only have seven
hours till Bunky’s party.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.622
In two hours
I’ll have a light snack

06:28.655 --> 06:30.591
so I won’t pig out
on the hors d’oeuvres.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.893
And in three hours
and 15 minutes

06:32.926 --> 06:35.929
I’ll shave so I’ll be smooth,
yet a little swarthy.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.964
And, in four hours

06:37.998 --> 06:40.501
the gold paint on
your credit card should be dry.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.505
Cousin, uh, do you want me
to do the rest of your wallet?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.940
Your, your library card,
sure looks a little shabby.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.441
No, no, no, no.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.043
‐Just the credit card’s fine.
‐Okay.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.546
[telephone ringing]

06:52.579 --> 06:53.880
Hello.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.983
Oh, yeah, hi, Bunkster! Yes!

06:57.017 --> 06:59.520
Yeah, oh, no, we haven’t
forgotten about the party.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.688
No, Balki and I’ll be there
with bells on.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.423
Cousin, I get to wear my bells?

07:05.025 --> 07:07.193
No, no you don’t get
to wear your bells.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.930
‐Oh!
‐Yeah, yeah, what’s that?

07:09.963 --> 07:12.933
Oh, uh, you and the gang just
got back from the Caribbean?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.968
Well, well,
isn’t that a coincidence?

07:15.001 --> 07:16.737
So did Balki and I.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.908
Yeah? Oh, yeah, no,
we love the tropics.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.679
Oh, yeah.
Sun and surf, surf and sun.

07:25.712 --> 07:26.947
Right.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.448
Yeah, I’m surprised
we didn’t run into ya.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.719
Okay. Alright, see you tonight.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.754
Bye‐bye.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.123
Yes, I lied to Bunky.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.792
Yes, I have a good reason.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.794
Yes, I’ll tell it to you
if you just give me a chance.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.567
I lied to Bunky so that I
wouldn’t hurt their feelings.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.701
Well, I think that...
Wait, wait, wait‐‐

07:47.734 --> 07:48.902
If we go to that party

07:48.935 --> 07:50.737
and Bunky and his friends
find out we’re the only ones

07:50.771 --> 07:52.072
who haven’t been
to the Caribbean

07:52.105 --> 07:53.774
they are going to feel terrible.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.708
‐Well, I think it’s better‐‐
‐You wouldn’t want that‐‐

07:54.741 --> 07:56.242
‐Wait a minute. Would you‐‐
‐Would you?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.611
‐Would you?
‐Let me just, let me just‐‐

07:57.644 --> 07:59.513
You wouldn’t
want that to happen.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.947
Would you?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.850
No, no, I wouldn’t
want to hurt

08:03.884 --> 08:07.554
Muffy, Buffy, Puffy,
Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.290
‐Not to mention Wayne.
‐Good.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.825
Good. Now, we’ve got to hurry.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.760
We’ve only got a couple of hours
to get a suntan.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.597
Cousin, why, why,
why we do need a suntan?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.098
To prove that we have
been in the Caribbean.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.702
Cousin, this is where your
silly little plan falls apart.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.970
We don’t have enough time
to go to the Caribbean

08:24.004 --> 08:27.073
get a suntan and get back
in time for the party.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.909
I see what you’re saying.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.276
You’re saying that
we should get a suntan

08:30.310 --> 08:31.845
right here in the apartment.

08:31.878 --> 08:32.979
‐Good thinking, Balki‐‐
‐No, no, wait, wait, wait‐‐

08:33.013 --> 08:34.047
‐I‐I‐I‐‐
‐You know.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.081
I’d be nothing without you.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.552
I‐I‐I, I was
painting the card.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.621
[instrumental music]

08:46.627 --> 08:49.730
Okay, we’ve put on
the suntan lotion.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.965
We are ready to tan.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.800
I don’t know, Cousin, I...

08:53.834 --> 08:54.935
...I don’t know if it’s working.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.603
I put it on and I’m still as

08:56.637 --> 08:58.238
white as a mackerel
in the moonlight.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.777
Balki, first we have to get
into the tanning beds

09:03.810 --> 09:06.279
turn them on and let
the ultraviolet lights

09:06.312 --> 09:07.814
gradually tan us.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.882
Okay.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.954
Now.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.923
I’ll just set the alarm...

09:53.727 --> 09:54.728
...for half an hour.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.265
That should give us enough
of a tan to impress Bunky.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.970
Okay, now, put these on.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.042
Cousin, look! I found
Little Orphan Annie’s eyes!

10:10.844 --> 10:13.914
Balki, get into
the tanning bed, now.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.616
Okay, okay.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.121
The top of Barbie’s bikini?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.657
‐Balki.
‐Oh.

10:25.391 --> 10:28.128
[instrumental music]

10:34.367 --> 10:37.303
Oh, my Lord!
Balki, Balki, we overslept.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.741
Get up, get up!

11:01.261 --> 11:02.929
[screaming]

11:09.269 --> 11:11.071
[instrumental music]

11:28.154 --> 11:30.891
You know, cousin

11:30.924 --> 11:33.493
when we were
in the tanning beds

11:33.527 --> 11:35.461
I dreamt we were
at Bunky’s party.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.130
Yeah?

11:37.163 --> 11:38.364
It was on the sun.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.039
Alright, alright, maybe we did
get a little too much sun.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.208
A little too much sun?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.810
[laughing]

11:55.381 --> 11:58.519
Cousin, even though it means

11:58.552 --> 12:00.120
I won’t be meeting Wayne Newton

12:00.153 --> 12:03.123
I think we should
skip Bunky’s party.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.425
Balki,
if I don’t go to this party

12:05.458 --> 12:07.493
I’ll miss my chance to become a
member of the Beekman Club

12:07.528 --> 12:09.195
and I’ll regret it
for the rest of my life.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.064
Do you want me to regret it
for the rest of my life?

12:11.097 --> 12:13.767
Well, of course not, cousin.
You regret so much already.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.739
‐Ahh!
‐Ow!

12:20.373 --> 12:22.776
Alright, alright, come on.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.378
Let’s get our tuxes on.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.048
‐Now, we’re already late.
‐Yeah.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.415
‐So, we gotta hurry.
‐Okay.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.751
‐Let’s go.
‐Okay.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.490
[groaning]

12:44.931 --> 12:46.166
‐Ahh!
‐Ahh!

12:51.404 --> 12:52.806
‐Ahh!
‐Ahh!

12:55.341 --> 12:57.578
Alright,
let’s make a run for it.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.279
‐Okay, ready?
‐Yeah.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.248
One, two, three.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.450
[screaming]

13:12.325 --> 13:15.461
Truce, truce, truce.
Truce, truce, truce, truce.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.830
Truce.

13:18.364 --> 13:19.533
[sighing]

13:19.566 --> 13:21.067
[screaming]

13:24.070 --> 13:26.039
‐Alright, give me my tux.
‐Okay.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.841
[sobbing]

13:33.647 --> 13:36.049
[groaning]

13:39.285 --> 13:40.954
[screaming]

13:45.491 --> 13:49.863
Truce, truce, truce, truce,
truce, truce, truce.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.066
[screaming]

13:55.168 --> 13:56.469
‐Get your tux.
‐Okay.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.973
[panting]

14:07.113 --> 14:09.015
[sobbing]

14:15.455 --> 14:17.558
[groaning]

14:30.504 --> 14:32.873
[groaning]

15:11.011 --> 15:13.614
[groaning]

15:16.550 --> 15:18.018
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.119
Let’s just get this over with.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.486
Right, okay, ready?

15:20.521 --> 15:23.356
One, two, three.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.025
[screaming]

15:28.494 --> 15:30.931
[sighs]

15:34.668 --> 15:37.137
[instrumental music]

15:48.649 --> 15:51.217
Mary Anne,
do you see what I see?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.587
Yeah, nobody’s wearing
an evening gown.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.788
Boy, are they gonna
be embarrassed.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.626
(Jenifer)
’And nobody else has
a suntan, either.’

16:01.327 --> 16:03.564
Larry, are we... Larry?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.435
[grunting]

16:15.676 --> 16:19.179
Larry? Please, tell me
we’re at the wrong party.

16:19.212 --> 16:22.616
Well, I hope not,
otherwise we’ll miss Fluffy.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.050
Who’s fluffy?

16:24.084 --> 16:26.086
Oh, that’s Wayne Newton’s
real name.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.657
Appleton, glad
you could make it.

16:30.691 --> 16:34.360
Well, well, well, Bunky, you,
you said the party was formal.

16:34.394 --> 16:39.265
Oh, gee! Who was responsible
for telling Appleton?

16:39.299 --> 16:42.669
Oh, it was me.
I guess I forgot.

16:42.703 --> 16:44.638
[laughing]

16:46.472 --> 16:48.408
Say, Appleton, what did you
do in the Caribbean?

16:48.441 --> 16:50.777
Put out fires with your face?

16:54.781 --> 16:59.419
Oh, no, i‐i‐it’s nothing, it,
uh, it looks worse than it is.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.488
‐And Balki.
‐Hi, how are ya?

17:02.523 --> 17:04.790
I’m well. And you, how are you?

17:04.825 --> 17:08.228
Well, if I was a
charcoal briquette, I’d be fine.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.799
But it’s a small price
to pay to see Fluffy.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.500
Do you know Fluffy?

17:14.535 --> 17:18.571
Do I know Fluffy? I happen
to be Fluffy’s biggest fan.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.741
You know the album that
Fluffy cut in Cleveland

17:20.773 --> 17:21.842
right after he got the...

17:21.875 --> 17:24.511
[screaming]

17:24.545 --> 17:26.847
Uh, Bunky, uh,
I’d like to introduce you

17:26.880 --> 17:29.415
to my fiance, Jennifer Lyons.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.352
And this is, Mary Anne Spencer,
Balki’s, girlfriend.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.821
Whoa, major league, Appleton.

17:34.855 --> 17:37.724
Happy to meet you,
Jennifer, Mary Anne.

17:37.758 --> 17:40.360
Uh, thank you for inviting us.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.328
Well, everybody
enjoy yourselves.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.297
‐I’ll see you guys later.
‐Alright.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.737
I, I hate to see you
in this much pain.

17:50.771 --> 17:52.105
Maybe we should go.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.473
No, wh‐why don’t we just
sit down?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.124
[grunting]

18:12.158 --> 18:14.160
Aw, your sunburn?

18:14.194 --> 18:15.461
No, the chair’s on my foot.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.801
‐Are you okay?
‐Yes. Ah!

18:26.740 --> 18:29.910
Okay, now, everybody, come on,
let’s go. Attention.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.679
It’s coronation time.

18:32.713 --> 18:34.447
[applauds]

18:38.451 --> 18:41.254
Cousin, coronations
are my favorite flower.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.923
No, you’re wrong. Balki.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.826
I think they’re going to make me
a member of The Beekman Club.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.160
‐Oh.
‐Ow.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.394
‐Sorry.
‐Oh!

18:48.428 --> 18:51.865
See, what did I tell ya?
I’m in.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.868
Larry, Balki,
would you please join me?

18:56.670 --> 18:58.505
Oh, Cousin, are they going
to make me a member, too?

18:58.539 --> 19:00.574
Well, Bunky said he liked you.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.175
[screaming]

19:11.885 --> 19:13.954
Ladies and gentlemen

19:13.987 --> 19:17.223
the moment
you’ve all been waiting for.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.225
[cheering]

19:23.263 --> 19:26.266
We are going to crown
our kings for the evening.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.704
Our old friend from high school,
Larry Appleton

19:30.737 --> 19:34.841
and our new friend, his cousin,
Balki Bartokomous.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.877
[cheering]

19:39.713 --> 19:41.615
Not only are we in, we’re kings.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.416
I know.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.285
May I have the crowns, please?

19:47.821 --> 19:50.356
[laughing]

19:52.526 --> 19:54.628
No, no, don’t, don’t,
don’t, please?

19:54.661 --> 19:57.731
Hold your applause until
the end of the ceremony.

19:57.764 --> 20:01.434
Cousin, the, the previous kings
must have had enormous heads.

20:03.469 --> 20:07.340
Okay, now,
every king needs a throne.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.411
And we searched high and low

20:11.444 --> 20:13.379
for one that was worthy of you.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.552
[laughing]

20:27.661 --> 20:30.731
Cousin, it’s just like
King Ferdinand’s throne.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.401
We, we must really be important.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.773
No, Balki, they’re,
they’re making fun of us.

20:39.806 --> 20:43.443
All hail Appleton,
king of fools.

20:50.517 --> 20:54.521
You’re right, Bunky.
I am a fool.

20:54.555 --> 20:56.523
I wanted to be
a member of your club.

20:58.391 --> 21:02.529
I was stupid enough to think you
had changed since high school.

21:02.563 --> 21:04.030
But you’re still as cruel
and insensitive

21:04.064 --> 21:06.399
as, as you were then.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.836
And I, really don’t want to
spend another minute with you.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.877
Come on, Balki, we’re leaving.

21:16.910 --> 21:19.513
Just, just a moment.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.982
Frankly, I am shocked that
Wayne Newton would have

21:22.015 --> 21:23.650
anything to do with any of you.

21:24.885 --> 21:27.287
[instrumental music]

21:32.392 --> 21:35.762
Larry, I don’t understand why
you wanted to join Bunky’s club?

21:35.796 --> 21:36.797
He’s a jerk.

21:38.098 --> 21:42.969
Well, I think the only reason
I wanted to be in Bunky’s club

21:43.003 --> 21:46.707
was because Bunky
didn’t want me in his club.

21:48.108 --> 21:50.410
Cousin, on Mypos

21:50.443 --> 21:52.112
when we can’t make friends
with a skunk

21:52.145 --> 21:54.347
we consider that a good thing.

21:58.852 --> 22:01.387
I’ll try to remember that.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.457
Yeah, I, I must have been crazy.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.727
I, I don’t know why I’d want
to be friends with somebody

22:06.760 --> 22:09.495
like Bunky, when I already have

22:09.530 --> 22:11.832
three of the best friends
in the world.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.070
Well, Larry,
you’re not only my best friend

22:17.103 --> 22:18.505
you’re the man I love.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.510
That goes for me, too, Larry.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.982
I mean the friend part...

22:29.015 --> 22:31.918
...the love part
is...someone else.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.462
‐Ow!
‐Ow!

22:42.495 --> 22:45.431
[theme music]

22:51.772 --> 22:54.107
[theme music]

23:20.901 --> 23:23.570
[music continues]
