NARRATOR: Previously onX-Men...

00:02.958 --> 00:04.333
Who are you?
What do you want with us?

00:04.333 --> 00:08.708
My name is Sinister,
Mr. Sinister.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.333
I've heard the name.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.333
Frankly, I'm not impressed.

MR. SINISTER:
Get Jean Grey to the plane!

00:26.708 --> 00:28.291
Jean!

00:29.875 --> 00:31.625
Obey me.

00:31.625 --> 00:32.875
Obey!

00:39.000 --> 00:41.416
-Professor?
-You're alive!

00:41.416 --> 00:45.166
If you will rendezvous
with me at
the following coordinates...

00:45.166 --> 00:47.958
CYCLOPS: Morph said something
about Sinister
having the Professor.

00:47.958 --> 00:50.333
So, we're flying into a trap.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.000
Suits me.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Brace yourselves, people,
we're going in!

01:00.708 --> 01:02.416
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:06.708 --> 02:11.375
I'm afraid the accommodations
are hardly first-class,

02:11.375 --> 02:14.625
but you will only be here
until the X-Men join us.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.875
You should feel honored.

02:23.875 --> 02:29.833
Your genetic material
and theirs will live on
in my army of super-mutants

02:29.833 --> 02:32.583
after you're gone.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.166
Your plan is doomed, Sinister.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.125
You underestimate the X-Men.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.333
(GROANS)

02:41.250 --> 02:44.958
I have summoned
the X-Men into a trap.

02:51.125 --> 02:53.375
These are the coordinates
the Professor gave us.

02:53.375 --> 02:57.833
An uncharted
tropical valley hidden
in Antarctica?

02:57.833 --> 02:59.375
This is fantastic.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.875
Not his best landing.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.875

03:20.083 --> 03:21.958
Take it easy, chere.

03:21.958 --> 03:23.208
First, we charge the card.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
No! Gambit have no power either.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.250
Cyclops, your eyes!

03:34.250 --> 03:35.458
I know.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.583
Our powers have abandoned us.

03:37.583 --> 03:41.583
Curious. This phenomenon
cannot be natural.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.458
I'm at a loss to explain it.

03:43.458 --> 03:47.250
RUCKUS: You know what they say,
easy come, easy go!

03:47.250 --> 03:52.250

just might let you live.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.958
We'll never surrender
to Sinister.

04:01.958 --> 04:05.875
We took you apart once, Ruckus,
and we can do it again.

04:05.875 --> 04:09.166
That was when you had your
mutant powers.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.708
And since we aren't affected,

04:11.708 --> 04:15.875
I think you better
watch your mouth, and mine.

without your powers?

Sorry, lady. You got a date
with a man in a cape.

04:56.458 --> 05:01.000
You'll need more than
that piece of tin
to hide behind.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.583
You're not so much.

05:04.583 --> 05:07.875

Your mind reels from the power
of Vertigo.

There is no up nor down,
no left nor right.

If you give us no trouble,
you may live longer.

06:56.375 --> 07:00.708

has planned for us,

18:37.875 --> 18:39.125
(GROANING)

18:41.708 --> 18:43.875
He's gone all to pieces.

18:43.875 --> 18:47.125
Master! I'll save you, master.

18:50.708 --> 18:52.250
MR. SINISTER: The future

18:52.250 --> 18:58.250
cannot be destroyed so easily.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.000
Yes, it can.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.708
It will be a while before he
gets back together.

19:07.708 --> 19:08.875
(MORPH GROANS)

19:08.875 --> 19:10.250
Morph!

19:17.875 --> 19:19.750
BEAST: The detonations
are intensifying.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.625
CYCLOPS: Everybody out of here!

19:25.583 --> 19:27.208
(GROANING)

19:38.000 --> 19:41.958
XAVIER: It will take time
to put right what
Sinister tried to destroy.

19:41.958 --> 19:45.416
Thankfully, the X-Men
have proved
what I'd always hoped,

19:45.416 --> 19:49.750
that, in my absence,
they can carry on together
with our important work.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.875
When we return home,
I will be able to
remove the device

19:52.875 --> 19:55.000
Sinister implanted in Morph,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.208
but removing the psychic damage
will take longer.

19:58.208 --> 20:01.833
It was good to fight alongside
you again, Charles.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.000
Then join me in my work.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
That can never be.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.458
We each have our own destiny.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.458
Only the future will prove
which one of us is right.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.250
Goodbye, my friend.

20:27.708 --> 20:31.458
The Savage Land is cleansed
of outlanders.

20:32.458 --> 20:37.416
Now, its true future begins.

20:41.291 --> 20:44.458
