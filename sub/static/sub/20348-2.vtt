01:46.107 --> 01:48.276
<i>Did the missing person use
an aluminum-based deodorant?</i>

01:48.485 --> 01:51.029
<i>The man didn't shower
for five years.</i>

01:51.654 --> 01:53.698
<i>Hygiene was not a priority.</i>

01:54.073 --> 01:55.700
<i>Did the missing person
have visual impairment</i>

01:55.909 --> 01:57.118
<i>or wear corrective lenses?</i>

01:57.327 --> 01:58.453
<i>No. Uh, no, ma'am.</i>

01:58.703 --> 02:00.205
<i>He had 20/20 vision.</i>

02:00.371 --> 02:03.041
<i>He could see from the top of that pillar
all the way to the bridge.</i>

02:05.585 --> 02:08.797
Could you please describe
your relationship to the missing person?

02:09.255 --> 02:10.715
He was my husband.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.516
Your husband, what was he, uh, doing
up there on that pillar?

02:19.724 --> 02:21.309
<i>Is that on your little questionnaire, too?</i>

02:21.768 --> 02:23.436
No. I was just curious.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.397
- Guess.
<i>- What?</i>

02:26.981 --> 02:29.150
Guess. What do you think
he was doing up there?

02:32.529 --> 02:34.739
I think it was an elaborate
coping mechanism.

02:35.031 --> 02:37.116
<i>Coping mechanism? For what?</i>

02:37.700 --> 02:39.744
For whatever pain he was suffering.

02:40.745 --> 02:44.415
Honey, he wanted to suffer.

02:45.542 --> 02:49.420
He settled for the pillar only after
we got arrested trying to crucify him.

02:49.754 --> 02:52.549
I got one nail in
before those fuckers had me in cuffs.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.342
<i>Free country, my ass.</i>

02:54.592 --> 02:56.553
<i>But that pillar did the trick just fine.</i>

02:57.220 --> 03:01.891
<i>He stayed up there in the rain,
in the cold, in the burning sun.</i>

03:02.100 --> 03:04.519
<i>And he ate, and he peed,
and he shit up there.</i>

03:04.769 --> 03:07.272
<i>He never came down,
never touched another person,</i>

03:07.856 --> 03:09.148
<i>not even his own wife.</i>

03:09.774 --> 03:11.818
That man never wavered.

03:12.569 --> 03:14.612
He proved himself to God,

03:16.781 --> 03:18.575
and last night he got his reward.

03:22.579 --> 03:23.746
You saw him depart?

03:24.122 --> 03:25.373
Yes, ma'am.

03:25.790 --> 03:29.294
He looked so calm and at peace.

03:30.128 --> 03:34.507
And all of a sudden,
he just kind of faded out

03:35.800 --> 03:37.260
like he was on a dimmer.

03:37.552 --> 03:38.887
And, um...

03:39.637 --> 03:41.139
And he was gone.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.349
And it was beautiful.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.978
So, you just happened to be awake
and looking right at him

03:47.186 --> 03:50.189
at the exact moment
that he, uh, dimmed out?

03:52.317 --> 03:54.193
I wasn't the only one who saw him.

03:54.903 --> 03:56.279
Ask around.

04:03.453 --> 04:06.664
She says there will be
another departure here on the 14th.

04:06.831 --> 04:10.501
I mean, I didn't actually see it happen,

04:12.503 --> 04:14.130
but, uh, how else could he get down
from that thing?

04:14.631 --> 04:16.591
And the man on the pillar
was the first to go

04:16.841 --> 04:18.176
because he was the highest up.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.637
I don't know how else to explain it.

04:20.887 --> 04:23.097
He just popped like a bubble.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.857
His wife was a woman of God,

04:33.066 --> 04:35.818
and she spent all morning
with the preacher.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.696
Thank God for the preacher.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.453
Would you happen to know
the name of this preacher?

04:53.503 --> 04:54.671
Hello?

04:55.213 --> 04:56.714
It's open. Come in.

05:02.387 --> 05:03.388
Are you okay?

05:03.721 --> 05:05.556
I'm fine. Just a nosebleed.

05:06.099 --> 05:07.976
I take it you're here
to yell at me about the book?

05:08.518 --> 05:09.560
What book?

05:10.436 --> 05:12.105
The one I gave Kevin. He didn't tell you?

05:12.355 --> 05:14.440
Oh. No, he told me. I'm staying out of it.

05:17.694 --> 05:21.030
So, you wanna tell me
where the man on the pillar is?

05:21.698 --> 05:23.449
It's my understanding he departed.

05:23.616 --> 05:26.619
I didn't witness it myself,
but that's what people saw.

05:27.078 --> 05:29.080
People also saw you with his wife.

05:31.082 --> 05:32.417
Sandy and I are friends.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.544
She lost a husband. I offered comfort.

05:34.836 --> 05:38.589
Matt, I can literally see the lie wheel
turning in your brain.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.675
When did I ever lie to you?

05:41.175 --> 05:44.012
When I was five, I stood out on the street
while our house burned down

05:44.220 --> 05:46.180
with our mom and dad inside
and you told me it didn't hurt

05:46.347 --> 05:47.515
because they were already in heaven.

05:47.765 --> 05:48.850
They are.

05:51.811 --> 05:52.979
Where is he, Matt?

05:59.110 --> 06:03.364
You know, that poor woman
lived across the bridge

06:03.531 --> 06:05.616
in that horrible encampment
for three years

06:05.783 --> 06:07.326
just to be close to her husband.

06:08.286 --> 06:09.996
<i>And when they finally allowed her back in,</i>

06:10.163 --> 06:12.582
<i>she pitched her tent
right at the base of that pillar</i>

06:12.832 --> 06:14.876
<i>and took care of him every single day,</i>

06:15.668 --> 06:19.005
even though he never acknowledged her,
never gave a word of thanks.

06:21.632 --> 06:25.470
Her loyalty and devotion,
I've never seen anything like it.

06:28.973 --> 06:30.933
Except when you did it for Mary.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.772
I get it, Matt. She left.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.732
My heart breaks for both of you,

06:38.149 --> 06:41.319
but you making up this bullshit story
about some nutjob departing...

06:41.486 --> 06:42.820
He had a heart attack.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.989
He fell and he died,

06:45.198 --> 06:46.657
and his wife brought him to the church

06:46.824 --> 06:48.910
and asked me to give him
a Christian burial.

06:49.160 --> 06:53.331
And she asked me to promise,
promise not to say anything,

06:53.498 --> 06:55.416
but I didn't lie, Nora.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.210
<i>I did not lie.</i>

07:05.384 --> 07:07.220
He deserves a legacy.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.516
Can't you give a man a little grace?

07:14.936 --> 07:17.480
So, are you gonna dig him up or should I?

07:21.025 --> 07:22.944
One's for dry cleaning,
one's for gym clothes,

07:23.152 --> 07:24.737
and then the last one's
for everything else.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.615
Honey, you don't need to justify
your desire to have three hampers.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.117
It's not a desire, it's a need.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.577
Well, maybe we should get a fourth hamper
just in case one breaks.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.038
You're jealous. That's okay.

07:34.705 --> 07:38.042
- It's hard to acknowledge my genius idea.
- Boy, is it.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.051
- Ready?
- Yep.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.512
All right.

07:50.888 --> 07:54.892
One King James Bible
wrapped in Saran Wrap.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.062
One thermos.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.398
Empty.

08:06.571 --> 08:07.738
What?

08:10.241 --> 08:12.535
If I told you this was a picture of him
and a killer whale,

08:12.743 --> 08:14.579
- would you believe me?
- No, I would not.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.835
Huh!

08:21.210 --> 08:22.461
<i>Good morning.</i>

08:24.088 --> 08:25.464
Taking over up there?

08:28.885 --> 08:30.261
Just cleaning up.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.097
Came by to pay my respects.

08:33.598 --> 08:34.932
He was friends with Michael.

08:36.267 --> 08:38.269
Hey, John, I read your book.

08:42.899 --> 08:44.066
- You did?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.360
Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom
and I picked it up,

08:46.527 --> 08:48.487
and before I knew it,
20 minutes had flown by.

08:48.654 --> 08:49.739
It's exciting.

08:53.784 --> 08:54.952
Y'all have a nice day.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.462
I didn't leave it in the bathroom.

09:05.129 --> 09:07.173
If we can't have a sense of humor
about you being the Messiah,

09:07.340 --> 09:08.424
we're gonna have a problem.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.407
These are his personal effects.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.994
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:38.079 --> 09:40.831
Me too, me too. I'm sorry for your loss.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.960
Well, I appreciate that
very much, sweetheart.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.672
If you don't mind, I'm just gonna sit here
and smoke my coping mechanism.

09:50.967 --> 09:52.093
She's just hurt.

09:53.052 --> 09:54.720
Of course she is.

09:56.222 --> 09:57.682
<i>You took him from his pillar,</i>

09:57.848 --> 10:00.309
<i>now he sits in heaven by your side.</i>

10:01.560 --> 10:04.855
He departed from our world
to be rewarded in yours.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.817
- Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
- Excuse me. Hello.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.029
Hi. You know what happened to him?

10:12.613 --> 10:14.031
- What really happened?
- Come on.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.743
Have a good day. God bless.

10:18.119 --> 10:19.453
"God bless"?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.248
Who gives a shit
if they wanna believe that he lifted?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.457
It's not true.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.084
Well, in 10 days,
when the world doesn't end,

10:25.251 --> 10:26.294
they're all gonna go home

10:26.460 --> 10:28.296
and they're gonna find something else
that's not true.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.589
Till then, I need to keep things
nice and calm.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.966
I am nice and calm.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.801
Yeah. Hey.

10:35.011 --> 10:38.180
You're the calmest
and the nicest person I know.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.479
Bye-bye.

10:45.896 --> 10:46.939
Bye-bye.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.080
<i>Hard part's over.</i>

11:08.461 --> 11:10.504
Just gonna crack this open, okay?

11:11.422 --> 11:13.507
<i>And you are free. Congratulations.</i>

11:16.594 --> 11:17.720
<i>How's it feeling?</i>

11:18.304 --> 11:20.723
Can you wiggle your fingers, make a fist?

11:21.849 --> 11:23.893
Good as new. Thank you.

11:26.145 --> 11:29.815
Ms. Durst, I'm sorry
if this seems inappropriate,

11:31.025 --> 11:33.861
but when you came in last month
to get the cast, one of the orderlies,

11:34.153 --> 11:36.197
he said he saw you in the parking lot
before you came in.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.283
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding,

11:40.368 --> 11:42.995
but he said that he saw you
slam your car door on your arm

11:43.204 --> 11:44.205
on purpose.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.252
Now, why in God's name would I do that?

12:02.306 --> 12:05.351
- Hello?
<i>- Hi. Is this Nora Durst?</i>

12:05.559 --> 12:07.311
Yes. Who is this?

12:07.853 --> 12:10.147
<i>- Is this a secure line?</i>
- Who is this?

12:11.524 --> 12:13.234
<i>It's Mark Linn-Baker.</i>

12:13.442 --> 12:16.195
- Who?
<i>- Mark Linn-Baker.</i>

12:16.737 --> 12:21.158
<i>I'm, uh, calling on behalf of
a third party, and they...</i>

12:21.367 --> 12:23.994
<i>Well, they've asked me to ask you,</i>

12:24.161 --> 12:26.247
<i>would you like to see your children again?</i>

12:26.956 --> 12:28.040
What?

12:31.252 --> 12:35.256
<i>Your children, Erin and Jeremy,
would you like to see them again?</i>

12:38.050 --> 12:39.677
I've got news for you, you shit.

12:39.844 --> 12:43.222
Your third party obviously doesn't know
that I'm a fraud investigator for the DSD,

12:43.431 --> 12:44.473
and I'm gonna have this call traced,

12:44.640 --> 12:46.016
and I'm gonna find out
what exactly it is...

12:46.183 --> 12:47.852
<i>They know your kids' names, Nora.</i>

12:48.060 --> 12:49.812
<i>I'm pretty sure they know what you do.</i>

12:50.146 --> 12:51.564
<i>And they don't care.</i>

12:52.022 --> 12:55.192
<i>You don't have to trace me.
I'm at the Crown Central in St. Louis.</i>

12:55.359 --> 12:57.528
<i>Just ask for Mark Linn-Baker.</i>

13:00.322 --> 13:02.324
- St. Louis?
<i>- Yes.</i>

13:02.533 --> 13:04.785
<i>And I'm only gonna be here
for the next 24 hours,</i>

13:04.994 --> 13:10.541
<i>so if you want to see your children,
you need to come and see me in person.</i>

13:12.751 --> 13:13.878
<i>Nora?</i>

13:14.628 --> 13:15.796
Yeah?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.466
<i>This is real.</i>

13:53.959 --> 13:55.252
George Brevity. Hello.

13:55.461 --> 13:57.588
- Hey, George. It's Nora Durst.
<i>- Hey, Nora.</i>

13:57.838 --> 13:59.381
<i>I just got your paperwork
on the pillar guy.</i>

13:59.965 --> 14:02.092
Extra credit
for sending the photos of the corpse.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.387
Oof! What, did he land on his head?

14:05.554 --> 14:07.348
Oh, is that Durst? Go and ask her, man.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.100
<i>Hey, Ocko wants to know
if you ever found out</i>

14:10.309 --> 14:12.144
<i>what he was doing up on that thing
for five years.</i>

14:12.520 --> 14:13.562
Suffering, apparently.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.022
Hey, George, listen.

14:15.231 --> 14:17.942
Tell me, how do I know the name
Mark Linn-Baker?

14:18.317 --> 14:19.777
The <i>Perfect Strangers</i> guy?

14:20.778 --> 14:21.820
<i>Who?</i>

14:22.196 --> 14:23.364
The sitcom.

14:23.572 --> 14:24.698
Yeah, they were cousins.

14:24.949 --> 14:26.700
One of them was a foreign guy, Yalki.

14:26.951 --> 14:29.620
<i>- Balki.</i>
- Balki, right. Yeah. Yeah.

14:29.954 --> 14:32.665
<i>- Mark Linn-Baker was the other cousin.</i>
- He faked his departure.

14:32.957 --> 14:36.794
Yeah, Balki and the two actresses
who played their wives lifted on the 14th.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.839
Mark felt left out
and ran off to Mexico for three years.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.509
You know what he's doing now?

14:43.968 --> 14:45.803
<i>No. Why?</i>

14:46.136 --> 14:48.639
I think he's running a carrot stick
out of St. Louis.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.100
<i>No shit?</i>

14:51.308 --> 14:54.144
- Will you authorize my travel?
<i>- Aw, jeez, Nora, I mean,</i>

14:54.979 --> 14:58.315
we got our hands full right now,
you know, with the seven-year itch coming.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.485
<i>- Well, can't it wait?</i>
- I need to go now, today.

15:02.361 --> 15:03.654
I think this is really big.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.658
All right. Keep all your receipts, okay?

15:07.866 --> 15:09.660
Okay. Thanks.

15:09.994 --> 15:11.036
All right, bye-bye.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.498
She's going.

15:22.423 --> 15:23.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:23.882 --> 15:24.925
What are you doing home?

15:26.844 --> 15:28.846
Uh, I just came home to change a shirt.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.681
Oh.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.684
Sick of me already?

15:34.018 --> 15:35.644
I have to go to St. Louis for work.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.771
Just a couple of nights.

15:38.856 --> 15:40.190
Oh.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.192
I'm gonna miss you.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.445
I'll miss you, too.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.866
Oh, do you mind if I borrow this?
I need something to read on the plane.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.327
Really?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.495
- You don't want me to take it?
- No.

15:53.746 --> 15:56.332
Uh, no. Matt said there's only one copy.

15:56.749 --> 15:58.709
Maybe Matt should've gone to Kinko's.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.045
Oh.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.339
Are you... You busting my balls?

16:03.714 --> 16:05.924
Can holy balls be busted?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.428
I would love for you to take it.

16:10.054 --> 16:11.805
We're on the same page about this, right?

16:12.056 --> 16:13.223
That it's ridiculous?

16:13.390 --> 16:14.933
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.896
Mmm. "And she did kiss the lips of Kevin.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.273
"And lo, it was good."

16:28.238 --> 16:29.239
<i>Love you.</i>

16:29.615 --> 16:31.450
Try not to walk on too much water
when I'm gone, okay?

16:31.659 --> 16:32.910
I won't.

16:33.911 --> 16:35.663
And I love you, too.

17:05.984 --> 17:06.985
Uh...

17:08.112 --> 17:09.154
May I help you, ma'am?

17:09.863 --> 17:11.865
Uh, this isn't letting me hit "No."

17:13.659 --> 17:15.911
And are you traveling
with an infant today?

17:16.203 --> 17:18.539
- No.
- Okay.

17:18.831 --> 17:20.457
Hmm.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.167
It must be a dead spot.

17:22.418 --> 17:23.460
Just go ahead and click "Yes."

17:23.711 --> 17:25.587
It doesn't matter.
You're only taking up one seat.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.638
May I use another kiosk, please?

18:01.832 --> 18:04.334
All right, a deluxe room, one king.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.004
Just a reminder,
we are a nonsmoking hotel.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.798
And you requested that
a rental car be dropped off for you

18:10.007 --> 18:11.925
- here at the hotel tomorrow morning?
- Yes, that's right.

18:13.719 --> 18:14.720
Great.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.096
Is there anything else
that I can help you with?

18:16.847 --> 18:18.682
Actually, I'm here to meet
with one of your guests.

18:19.183 --> 18:21.143
Oh, of course.
May I have the guest's name, please?

18:21.477 --> 18:24.813
Um, Mark Linn-Baker.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.328
<i>Who is it?</i>

18:39.495 --> 18:42.331
They just called from downstairs.
You know who it is.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.628
It's Nora Durst.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.219
Please, come on in.

19:00.933 --> 19:04.144
<i>Did you know
they have a tailor here on premises?</i>

19:05.395 --> 19:06.522
I bought this suit yesterday.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.398
They just sent a guy up, measures me.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.650
Two hours later, it's back.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.194
I never had a suit fit like this
in my life.

19:12.945 --> 19:14.655
It's very nice.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.323
<i>May I have your cell phone, please?</i>

19:16.573 --> 19:17.783
- What?
- Your phone.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.077
I just need to make sure
you're not recording this.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.495
I'm not.

19:22.079 --> 19:23.413
Please?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.499
Ugh, okay.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.170
<i>Hey!</i>

19:30.754 --> 19:32.089
What are you doing?

19:32.297 --> 19:33.590
Sorry.

19:33.757 --> 19:34.883
Uh, it's just hardware.

19:39.513 --> 19:42.140
Everything that matters
is up there in the cloud, right?

19:44.768 --> 19:46.436
Uh, please, have a seat.

19:49.565 --> 19:52.776
Uh.. Sorry. I took notes.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.320
- I don't wanna mess up the science.
- Hmm.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.742
Okay.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.456
There are a couple types of radiation.

20:07.624 --> 20:10.627
Non-ionizing and ionizing.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.296
Now, there are a couple types of that.

20:12.504 --> 20:15.591
There's alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron.

20:16.008 --> 20:17.134
Neutron is rare.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.471
You only find it near
particle accelerators or reactors.

20:21.805 --> 20:26.018
And yet, trace amounts were cataloged
within the first 48 hours

20:26.310 --> 20:30.439
following October 14th
at sites where departures occurred.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.984
- You with me so far?
- Oh, absolutely.

20:34.318 --> 20:38.113
All right, the guys who discovered this,
they bring their findings to Switzerland.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.909
And the physicists,
the best physicists in the world,

20:42.117 --> 20:44.453
- they confirm those findings.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:44.953 --> 20:50.083
And they name it LADR,
low amplitude Denziger radiation.

20:50.626 --> 20:51.835
<i>So, great.</i>

20:52.169 --> 20:53.337
Big deal.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.881
They found LADR at departure sites.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.008
But it's a footprint.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.177
A shadow.

21:00.344 --> 21:02.512
You can't do anything with it
because it dissipated.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.139
It's gone.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.600
Well, what if they could make more?

21:08.185 --> 21:09.519
<i>If they could recreate it?</i>

21:10.979 --> 21:14.107
They could build a device
and whatever they put inside that device,

21:14.274 --> 21:16.526
they could blast it with that radiation...

21:18.028 --> 21:19.655
And it would go.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.866
Go? Where?

21:24.034 --> 21:25.369
Wherever they went.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.746
The 2%.

21:29.539 --> 21:31.875
So, they built it, this device?

21:32.417 --> 21:34.503
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>
- Then why haven't I heard of it?

21:35.212 --> 21:38.590
No one would let them conduct
beta testing on live subjects.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.884
- You mean people?
<i>- Right.</i>

21:41.510 --> 21:44.012
Because they were blasting them
with radiation?

21:44.304 --> 21:45.347
Exactly.

21:45.555 --> 21:48.767
So, they had to leave Switzerland.
The unit is mobile now.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.686
They don't stay in one place for too long.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.355
That was smart of them.

21:54.398 --> 21:55.732
Ah.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.568
I know what you're thinking.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.407
They made me go to a hotel in Phoenix.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.828
I felt the same way you do right now
when I heard it the first time.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.371
Her name was Lauren.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.374
Uh-huh. Where's Lauren now?

22:14.626 --> 22:16.253
She went through.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.422
- Through?
- Through.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.766
So, what's the cost?

22:30.642 --> 22:32.769
Well, it's different for everyone. Uh...

22:32.978 --> 22:35.689
I think it's based on a percentage
of your overall net worth.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.774
- I can tell you what I paid... Yeah?
- Mark.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.610
I don't know if you are a part of this
or a victim of it,

22:40.777 --> 22:43.822
but if this is real,
if they've actually built this device,

22:44.072 --> 22:48.285
they're not sending people
to some magical place

22:48.452 --> 22:50.328
to be with their loved ones.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.959
They're incinerating them.

23:01.506 --> 23:05.177
They will call you on this

23:06.136 --> 23:08.680
with a formal invitation and instructions.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.308
All you have to do is answer it.

23:12.601 --> 23:13.602
And this

23:15.228 --> 23:18.356
is a digital record of the people
who have gone through.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.942
A hundred and nineteen testimonials.

23:22.110 --> 23:25.405
They are not hapless suckers, not victims.

23:26.156 --> 23:29.451
Each and every one of them
had to pass an IQ test to qualify.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.495
There's a Nobel laureate in there.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.914
I have two degrees from Yale.

23:39.211 --> 23:40.462
Are you married, Mark?

23:45.217 --> 23:46.635
Not anymore.

23:48.386 --> 23:49.471
You?

23:50.180 --> 23:51.848
I'm in a committed relationship.

23:52.724 --> 23:59.022
Oh. Well, then I guess
I am just wasting my breath, huh?

23:59.523 --> 24:01.024
Yes, you are.

24:03.527 --> 24:06.363
And I think you may be suicidal.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.536
Four series regulars.

24:13.370 --> 24:15.705
Three go, one stays.

24:15.914 --> 24:16.957
Me.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.503
You know what the odds of that are?

24:25.507 --> 24:27.843
One in 128,000.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.390
What happened was arbitrary.

24:34.349 --> 24:37.519
It was purposeless.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.272
It wasn't my fault.

24:40.730 --> 24:44.192
I didn't do anything to deserve this.

24:44.359 --> 24:47.195
So, no, Nora, I don't wanna kill myself.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.241
I want to take some fucking control.

Hi.

34:16.973 --> 34:18.182
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:21.686 --> 34:25.148
So, Michael said Tommy's party was fun.

34:25.356 --> 34:26.399
Yeah, it was nice.

34:26.566 --> 34:27.775
You were missed.

34:31.654 --> 34:32.947
I see you got your cast off.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.825
Oh. Yeah. Day before yesterday.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.161
You know I would've done it for you.

34:38.411 --> 34:39.746
I didn't wanna waste your time.

34:42.498 --> 34:43.833
How'd you break it?

34:44.834 --> 34:46.169
I'm clumsy.

34:47.628 --> 34:50.715
Did I ever tell you how the day
after October 14th I broke my leg?

34:51.549 --> 34:53.926
There was a picture of me on crutches
in the newspaper

34:54.135 --> 34:55.678
once they found out about my family.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.849
The headline was "Nora Cursed."

35:03.728 --> 35:05.396
Rhymes with Durst.

35:09.984 --> 35:11.694
- Nora.
- Hmm?

35:12.945 --> 35:14.614
How'd you break it?

35:16.949 --> 35:18.993
I don't wanna lie to you.

35:19.744 --> 35:21.078
Then don't.

35:26.042 --> 35:28.544
I broke it to cover something up.

35:35.510 --> 35:36.844
Show me.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.898
It's the logo for the Wu-Tang band.

35:50.650 --> 35:53.736
- I think you mean the Wu-Tang Clan.
- Right.

35:54.278 --> 35:55.905
Big fan.

35:58.282 --> 35:59.617
What were you covering up?

36:02.745 --> 36:04.956
Um...

36:05.873 --> 36:07.542
My kids' names.

36:16.759 --> 36:19.428
The artist did a beautiful job.
It was very tasteful.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.098
Very understated.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.978
And it didn't hurt, the needle.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.021
It was... It felt good.

36:30.815 --> 36:32.149
But, um...

36:35.361 --> 36:39.156
Just as he was finishing up,
I played it out.

36:41.659 --> 36:43.160
I thought for the rest of my life

36:44.120 --> 36:45.580
people would come up to me
and they would say,

36:45.830 --> 36:47.915
"Oh, what a nice tattoo.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.542
"Who are Erin and Jeremy?"

36:49.792 --> 36:51.586
And I would say, "They're my children."

36:55.256 --> 36:58.593
"I'm Nora Cursed.
Ask me about my poor, departed children."

37:00.177 --> 37:01.679
It was pathetic.

37:03.139 --> 37:07.059
So, I pointed to
the first thing I saw on the wall,

37:07.226 --> 37:09.228
it looked like a phoenix,

37:09.562 --> 37:11.022
and I told the guy
to give me that one instead.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.691
"Just cover it up, please,"
like it never fucking happened.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.988
I was having a bad day.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.577
I think I'm going crazy.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.370
Mmm-mmm.

37:27.538 --> 37:29.749
You are not going crazy, Nora.

37:33.169 --> 37:35.880
How are you not going crazy after Evie?

37:39.300 --> 37:40.676
Evie died...

37:43.095 --> 37:44.430
And I got to bury her.

37:47.058 --> 37:48.726
I got to bury her.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.653
I bought a trampoline.

39:23.654 --> 39:25.823
Come on.

39:43.507 --> 39:44.759
Evening, ma'am.

39:44.967 --> 39:46.469
License and registration, please.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.971
Um, my boyfriend's the chief of police
in this town.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.348
You think I can get off
with a warning, Officer?

39:52.892 --> 39:55.061
Okay.

39:55.269 --> 39:58.189
Consider yourself warned.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.816
I just got off my shift.
Do you wanna go grab a drink?

40:01.275 --> 40:03.778
Can I take a rain check?
I just got back from a business trip.

40:06.238 --> 40:07.740
Business trip?

40:10.659 --> 40:12.495
Christine called you?

40:36.602 --> 40:38.270
I didn't go to see her.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.064
I was in St. Louis on business.

40:40.314 --> 40:41.440
They live in Kentucky.

40:42.942 --> 40:44.443
How'd you even know where to find her?

40:44.860 --> 40:46.028
She's not hiding, Tom.

40:46.195 --> 40:48.280
She's putting pictures of Lily
on Instagram and Facebook.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.865
Her name's not Lily anymore.

40:54.036 --> 40:56.038
Christine just wants to know
if she should be worried.

40:56.872 --> 40:58.541
She came after me.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.168
She filed for custody because

41:01.377 --> 41:03.045
she made the single
worst mistake of her life.

41:03.254 --> 41:04.672
She wanted to fight me.

41:04.964 --> 41:06.298
And did I fight back, Tom?

41:07.466 --> 41:08.509
No.

41:08.843 --> 41:10.177
No, I didn't.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.513
I sat across from her at the deposition,

41:12.721 --> 41:15.891
and all I saw was a mother
who had lost her child.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.144
<i>And I gave her child back.</i>

41:18.394 --> 41:19.812
And now she doesn't know who I am.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.857
So, no, Tom, nobody has to worry about me.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.201
Kevin adopted me when I was three.

41:35.703 --> 41:37.204
I don't even remember that.

41:37.997 --> 41:39.665
I grew up thinking he was my real dad.

41:42.126 --> 41:44.253
Then, when I was 10,
he and my mom decided

41:44.420 --> 41:48.257
that I should know about my real father,
my biological father.

41:56.473 --> 41:59.935
I spent the next 10 years of my life

42:00.227 --> 42:02.938
knocking on some asshole's fucking door

42:03.230 --> 42:04.940
who wanted nothing to do with me.

42:05.524 --> 42:07.902
<i>He had moved on. He had a new family.</i>

42:08.944 --> 42:11.780
So, I wish they wouldn't have told me,

42:12.615 --> 42:14.867
because I was already where I belonged.

42:18.454 --> 42:20.289
Well, do you know what I wish?

42:22.499 --> 42:24.585
I wish you'd never left her for me.

42:28.631 --> 42:30.966
I didn't leave Lily for you, Nora.

42:32.301 --> 42:34.136
I left her for my dad.

42:36.472 --> 42:37.973
I didn't even know you existed.

43:11.966 --> 43:13.801
Can I print a photo from this?

43:18.514 --> 43:19.848
Which one do you wanna print?

43:21.600 --> 43:23.018
This one, please.

43:26.522 --> 43:28.399
- Jesus.
- How big can I make it?

43:53.007 --> 43:54.717
You are a heartless bitch.

44:01.265 --> 44:03.475
Hey! Hey! Hey, God damn you!

44:04.893 --> 44:06.729
God damn you to hell!

45:03.285 --> 45:04.620
You're home.

45:13.629 --> 45:15.547
I thought you were gone till tomorrow.

45:22.096 --> 45:23.931
I tear it off every time.

45:30.229 --> 45:32.398
I just do it to feel...

45:36.819 --> 45:38.487
I don't wanna die.

45:54.837 --> 45:56.171
It's okay.

45:57.965 --> 45:59.049
It is?

46:01.802 --> 46:04.138
You don't need to explain, Kevin.

46:07.433 --> 46:08.767
Hey, look.

46:11.687 --> 46:13.188
I got a tattoo.

46:16.608 --> 46:18.652
A couple hundred more
and I'll catch up with you.

46:24.867 --> 46:26.535
Let's have a baby.

46:27.035 --> 46:28.203
What?

46:31.290 --> 46:34.793
I wanna have a baby with you.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.178
I'm sorry.

46:49.099 --> 46:50.434
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47:03.530 --> 47:04.531
Oh.

47:10.204 --> 47:11.246
Hey.

47:13.415 --> 47:14.583
Sorry.

47:20.923 --> 47:22.424
Are you happy?

47:25.469 --> 47:26.553
Yes.

47:28.096 --> 47:29.640
I'm happy, too.

47:33.268 --> 47:35.437
Let's not fuck that up, okay?

47:42.903 --> 47:44.571
I need to get that.

47:44.738 --> 47:45.739
Yeah.

47:53.747 --> 47:55.666
- Yes?
<i>- Hello. Ms. Durst?</i>

47:55.916 --> 47:56.959
Yes.

47:57.668 --> 47:59.419
<i>Thank you for answering the call.</i>

47:59.670 --> 48:01.922
<i>Mark explained the opportunity
we're offering you?</i>

48:05.676 --> 48:06.760
Yes.

48:07.177 --> 48:08.762
<i>Someone is standing by to meet you</i>

48:08.929 --> 48:11.473
<i>at the Crown Central
in Melbourne, Australia.</i>

48:11.765 --> 48:14.643
<i>Can you be there by Tuesday
with $20,000 in cash?</i>

48:20.816 --> 48:23.819
- Yes, I can do that.
<i>- Excellent. We'll see you then.</i>

48:28.907 --> 48:30.867
- Who was that?
- Work.

48:34.663 --> 48:36.665
I need to go to Australia.

48:37.499 --> 48:39.501
Just for a couple of days.

48:43.505 --> 48:45.090
Can I come with you?

48:47.968 --> 48:49.011
Yeah.

48:51.013 --> 48:52.014
Yeah.

49:33.055 --> 49:36.224
<i>I can't be sure just yet, Jean,
but with the seventh anniversary of</i>

49:36.433 --> 49:38.727
<i>October 15 fast approaching,</i>

49:38.894 --> 49:41.313
<i>we may see some hellfire
moving up from the south.</i>

49:41.688 --> 49:42.731
<i>And off the Gold Coast,</i>

49:42.939 --> 49:47.569
<i>a high-pressure system of locusts
and perhaps blood boiling up.</i>

50:02.876 --> 50:03.919
Where you off to, then?

50:05.295 --> 50:08.090
Oh, uh, just closing up, Chief.

50:08.674 --> 50:10.217
Nothing's happening tonight.

50:10.634 --> 50:11.927
You a psychic, Gerry?

50:12.469 --> 50:13.637
Sorry?

50:15.305 --> 50:18.350
Are you, like, clairvoyant?

50:18.934 --> 50:20.227
Can you see into the future?

50:21.395 --> 50:23.605
- Uh, no, Chief.
<i>- No?</i>

50:24.606 --> 50:25.941
It's just that you've concluded that

50:26.108 --> 50:28.652
nothing's gonna happen tonight
because nothing has happened?

50:30.278 --> 50:31.279
Yeah.

50:31.863 --> 50:36.034
It's just,
Ginny's not feeling well, so...

50:36.326 --> 50:37.494
Ginny?

50:38.328 --> 50:39.329
Who's that?

50:40.580 --> 50:41.623
You know who she is.

50:42.082 --> 50:43.125
<i>I honestly don't.</i>

50:45.043 --> 50:46.795
I mean, it can't be your wife
'cause you haven't got a wife.

50:47.045 --> 50:48.797
I mean, it...

50:49.423 --> 50:50.882
Shit, I know who you're talking about.

50:51.133 --> 50:52.551
You're talking about your dog, aren't ya?

50:52.926 --> 50:54.344
Yep.

50:54.511 --> 50:55.512
Yeah, well, I'm afraid little Ginny's

50:55.679 --> 50:57.764
gonna have to wait for you to
come home tonight because

50:58.765 --> 50:59.975
you're on duty.

51:00.642 --> 51:03.145
- Yes, Chief. Yep.
<i>- Good.</i>

51:04.104 --> 51:06.732
Cruiser one's got 'roo brains all over it,
so give it a wash, will ya?

51:06.982 --> 51:08.024
I'm gonna take yours.

51:41.850 --> 51:43.143
This oughta be good.

51:49.316 --> 51:50.859
Good evening.

51:51.526 --> 51:52.736
G'day, sweetheart.

51:53.862 --> 51:55.071
Ladies.

51:59.284 --> 52:01.536
May I ask why you're blocking my driveway?

52:05.665 --> 52:07.209
Are you chief of police?

52:09.419 --> 52:10.837
Indeed I am.

52:12.214 --> 52:13.840
Is your name Kevin?

52:15.801 --> 52:17.302
Indeed it is.

52:23.600 --> 52:26.770
"And He looked at them
and raised His hand,

52:27.020 --> 52:28.897
"but they did not wave in response.

52:29.689 --> 52:34.027
"And so He clutched the stone to His chest
and jumped into the water."

52:40.450 --> 52:42.619
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

52:44.830 --> 52:46.665
I know who you are.

52:47.707 --> 52:49.751
Well, I don't know who you are.

52:51.586 --> 52:55.173
My name is Grace Playford
and I need your help.

52:56.550 --> 52:58.051
Well, Grace, uh,

52:58.760 --> 53:01.721
I'm off duty, so why don't
you and your girlfriends run along home

53:01.888 --> 53:03.265
before I call Mr. Playford?

53:04.975 --> 53:06.393
Will you come with us, please?

53:07.060 --> 53:08.061
I can explain everything.

53:08.228 --> 53:10.438
No, no, no, I don't want you
to explain fucking anything.

53:10.605 --> 53:12.941
I want you
to get the fuck off my property, and...

53:13.149 --> 53:14.401
What the...

53:18.738 --> 53:20.407
Jesus, Florence.

53:20.782 --> 53:22.409
Well, he wasn't coming.

53:50.186 --> 53:51.771
What the fuck?

53:52.230 --> 53:53.440
What's happening?

53:55.191 --> 53:56.735
It's all right.

53:57.027 --> 53:58.194
You're amongst friends.

54:00.864 --> 54:02.741
We know who you are.

54:04.367 --> 54:05.577
Let me go.

54:06.494 --> 54:08.580
I don't know why you're acting this way,

54:09.164 --> 54:12.167
but if I have to prove I know,
then so be it.

54:12.834 --> 54:14.169
Maybe it's not him.

54:15.879 --> 54:17.213
It's him.

54:17.797 --> 54:19.674
Let me go, you fucking cunt!

54:22.260 --> 54:23.762
I'll see you in two minutes.

54:33.271 --> 54:34.689
Stop it!

54:41.029 --> 54:42.948
No! Fuck off!

55:00.507 --> 55:03.218
- Grace, what if it's not him?
- It's him.

55:09.557 --> 55:11.226
<i>But what if it's not?</i>

55:39.295 --> 55:40.505
Okay, let him up.

55:43.466 --> 55:45.260
Okay, let him up!

56:16.958 --> 56:18.126
Kevin?

56:23.131 --> 56:24.299
Kevin?

56:27.594 --> 56:28.762
Kevin?

56:32.098 --> 56:33.600
Kevin, you need to wake up now.

56:34.601 --> 56:36.269
We know who you are.

56:38.021 --> 56:39.189
Wake up.

56:45.820 --> 56:48.448
Help me. Help me get the ropes off.

56:51.451 --> 56:53.119
Let's get him off.

56:54.037 --> 56:55.080
Get him off.

56:55.330 --> 56:56.956
<i>We've gotta get him...</i>

56:57.499 --> 56:58.750
<i>Come on.</i>

57:00.668 --> 57:02.545
<i>You all right, Naomi?</i>

57:06.925 --> 57:08.426
<i>Kevin...</i>

57:08.635 --> 57:09.677
Hey.

57:17.519 --> 57:19.562
What are you ladies up to?

58:31.467 --> 58:32.468
English-SDH
