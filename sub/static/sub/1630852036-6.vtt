12:05.491 --> 12:06.458
[Det. Witt] It did appear,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.326
consisting
with what Bruce described

12:08.427 --> 12:10.995
that Ryan met up
and ended up having

12:11.097 --> 12:14.699
a very positive, uh, visit
with his daughter Jordan.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.535
There was nothing
suspicious or concerning

12:30.516 --> 12:32.450
[Charlotte]
<i>Not hearing from Ryan,</i>

12:32.551 --> 12:34.586
it kinda took me by surprise,

12:34.687 --> 12:37.422
because if he didn't
have his phone on him,

12:37.523 --> 12:39.424
he would have got a hold of you

12:39.525 --> 12:41.960

[Det. Budd]<i> The hope was</i>

we're aware that it might
be more than

12:51.036 --> 12:52.303

24:33.338 --> 24:36.006
<i>an older GMC truck.</i>

24:36.107 --> 24:39.109
[tense music playing]

24:44.716 --> 24:45.683
[Det. Jacobs] <i>The lone occupant</i>

24:45.784 --> 24:49.353
<i>got out of the driver side.</i>

24:49.454 --> 24:52.456
[tense music playing]

24:59.064 --> 25:01.031
[Det. Jacobs]<i> He started</i>
<i>to meticulously</i>

25:01.132 --> 25:04.001
<i>wash that truck.</i>

25:04.102 --> 25:06.036
<i>He spent a great deal of time</i>

25:06.137 --> 25:08.806
spraying the passenger side
of the truck down,

25:11.276 --> 25:14.945
<i>around the box, the outside,</i>

25:15.046 --> 25:17.848
<i>the under panel
of the passenger side,</i>

25:17.949 --> 25:20.551
<i>the door, the mirror,
the window.</i>

25:20.652 --> 25:23.687
And then, he jumped up
into his truck

25:23.788 --> 25:25.155
<i>and started spraying out</i>

25:25.257 --> 25:29.260
<i>the back portion of the truck.</i>

25:32.797 --> 25:36.200
It seems pretty extensive.

25:36.301 --> 25:39.303
[tense music playing]

25:40.839 --> 25:42.907
[Det. Jacobs]<i> And then,</i>
<i>it really got my attention</i>

25:43.008 --> 25:45.342
<i>when he opened the driver's door</i>

25:45.443 --> 25:50.014
<i>and the passenger door,</i>

25:50.115 --> 25:53.384
<i>and got into the truck
with the power wash</i>

25:53.485 --> 25:58.355
<i>and started spraying down
the interior of the truck.</i>

25:58.456 --> 26:01.759
[dramatic music playing]

26:01.860 --> 26:04.328
He takes a lot of time
to power wash

26:04.429 --> 26:05.863
the inside of the truck,

26:05.964 --> 26:07.164
which is not something

26:07.265 --> 26:10.634
I had ever seen
as an investigator.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.504
[narrator]<i> Detectives can't</i>
<i>ID the truck driver,</i>

26:13.605 --> 26:15.039
<i>so they request a view footage</i>

charged four days earlier.</i>

26:19.711 --> 26:22.713
[dramatic music playing]

26:25.617 --> 26:27.284
An individual came in

26:27.385 --> 26:29.820
and, uh, put money on that card.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.359
<i>Comparing the video
from the 3rd to the 7th,</i>

26:35.460 --> 26:38.028
<i>again, with similar stature,</i>

26:38.129 --> 26:39.663
<i>walking with a limp</i>

26:39.764 --> 26:42.166
<i>and the height and weight
of that individual,</i>

26:42.267 --> 26:46.503
there was no doubt in my mind
that that was Will Rempel.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.607
[dramatic music playing]

26:51.910 --> 26:54.745
[narrator]<i> Detectives</i>
<i>then head to the salvage yard</i>

26:54.846 --> 26:57.815
<i>to investigate Will's receipt.</i>

26:59.684 --> 27:02.052
[Det. Witt] Hi.
Detective Witt, Calgary PD.

27:02.153 --> 27:04.054
We're investigating
a disappearance

27:04.155 --> 27:05.356
involving a red pickup truck.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.859
We believe may have been sold
to you by this man.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.528
Does he look familiar?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.031
[narrator]<i> The salvage yard</i>
<i>worker remembers Will Rempel</i>

27:14.132 --> 27:15.332
<i>selling his vehicle</i>

27:15.433 --> 27:17.668
<i>as he insisted it'd be scrapped.</i>

27:17.769 --> 27:19.670
[Det. Witt]<i> They thought</i>
<i>it was a bit strange</i>

27:19.738 --> 27:22.840
because it was in such
good condition.

27:22.941 --> 27:25.075
<i>I was very concerned</i>

27:25.176 --> 27:28.512
<i>about what kind of shape
it would be in.</i>

27:28.613 --> 27:30.814
When they advised me
that the truck was intact,

27:30.915 --> 27:32.950
I was enormously relieved

27:33.051 --> 27:35.185
<i>because it could
potentially help</i>

27:35.286 --> 27:37.788
<i>explain to us
what had happened to Ryan.</i>

27:41.126 --> 27:44.795
[narrator]<i> The vehicle is</i>
<i>seized and sent for analysis.</i>

27:46.965 --> 27:49.933
[dramatic music playing]

27:54.539 --> 27:56.440
[Det. Witt] So, if Will Rempel
kidnapped Ryan,

27:56.541 --> 27:58.275
what was his motivation?

27:58.376 --> 27:59.977
[narrator]<i> Will's only</i>
<i>connection to Ryan</i>

28:00.078 --> 28:03.347
<i>is his brother, Tim.</i>

28:03.448 --> 28:06.917
<i>They looked into Tim's
bank records for any clues.</i>

28:07.018 --> 28:08.819
There's gas station
transaction here

28:08.887 --> 28:11.255
at 8:15 PM on February the 6th.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.358
That's the night Ryan vanished

28:47.592 --> 28:50.294
There were two people
in that vehicle,

28:50.395 --> 28:53.630
<i>and the passenger,
I could not tell the identity</i>

28:53.732 --> 28:56.400
due to the footage being
the evening and not the best.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.503
[dramatic music playing]

29:05.810 --> 29:06.810
[Det. Jacobs] <i>At one point,</i>

29:06.911 --> 29:09.313
<i>the driver did get out
of the vehicle,</i>

29:09.414 --> 29:11.715
then this individual
went inside the store.

29:16.621 --> 29:19.857
<i>And this particular driver
had a ball cap on,</i>

29:19.958 --> 29:24.828
<i>a gray sweatshirt
that said skin on the front.</i>

29:24.929 --> 29:27.097
At the Esso gas station,

29:27.198 --> 29:29.500
the individual driving
the Jeep had a two-tone

29:29.601 --> 29:31.802
<i>light colored ball cap on.</i>

29:31.903 --> 29:33.837
<i>And in this particular video,</i>

<i>this individual also had</i>

29:35.206 --> 29:39.176
<i>a similar ball cap on as well.</i>

29:39.277 --> 29:41.879
I was able to definitively

29:41.980 --> 29:46.517
ID this person as Tim Rempel.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.751
[narrator] <i>The footage confirms,</i>

29:47.852 --> 29:50.020

30:00.632 --> 30:03.167
[Det. Witt]<i> We obtained blood</i>

30:06.271 --> 30:08.939
<i>Swabs were sent away
for analysis to our crime lab</i>

30:09.040 --> 30:11.708
and they confirmed that
that blood was Ryan's.

30:15.113 --> 30:18.515
[narrator]<i> Police suspect</i>
<i>that Ryan is likely dead,</i>

30:18.616 --> 30:20.250

inside of the truck,

30:25.356 --> 30:27.524
what that speaks to is foul play

from the payphone.

31:24.115 --> 31:27.718
[Tim speaking]

He said that he showed Ryan
some pictures of Jordan

and was having a conversation
about custody issues.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.830

31:41.666 --> 31:45.235
Tim tells us that he punched
Ryan in the face,

31:45.336 --> 31:47.004
which caused him to bleed a lot

31:47.105 --> 31:50.240

to drop to the ground.

wouldn't come
right out and say it

32:30.315 --> 32:34.384
but in a roundabout way,
he basically said that

32:34.485 --> 32:36.853

his ring in the barrel.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.149
because you knew that
there was no way of seeing him

the mysterious call

38:41.552 --> 38:45.922
<i>in March, 2016,
the trial begins.</i>

38:46.023 --> 38:48.224
So, the theory
that the Crown prosecutors

38:48.326 --> 38:51.328
put to the jury
and the judge was

38:51.429 --> 38:54.197
<i>that the three of them
had planned</i>

38:54.298 --> 38:56.800
<i>how they were gonna kidnap Ryan</i>

38:56.901 --> 38:59.903
<i>prior to February 6th.</i>

39:02.239 --> 39:03.807
<i>And then on February 6th,</i>

39:03.908 --> 39:07.410
<i>Sheena gives the okay
via text message to Tim.</i>

39:11.082 --> 39:12.582
[narrator] <i>Later that afternoon,</i>

39:12.683 --> 39:14.884
<i>Ryan meets up
with his daughter, Jordan,</i>

39:14.985 --> 39:17.987
<i>for the first time in two years.</i>

39:18.089 --> 39:19.189
[Det. Witt]<i> That night,</i>

39:19.290 --> 39:23.860
<i>Tim and Will lure Ryan
out of his house.</i>

39:23.961 --> 39:25.195
Hello?

39:25.296 --> 39:26.496
Hey, is this Ryan?

39:26.597 --> 39:29.132
Who is this?

39:29.233 --> 39:32.235
And Will kidnaps him.

39:37.742 --> 39:39.242
[narrator] <i>Will then drives Ryan</i>

39:39.343 --> 39:42.345
<i>to a remote area in Beiseker...</i>

39:54.325 --> 39:57.861
<i>where he meets his brother, Tim.</i>

39:57.962 --> 39:59.796
[Tim] This ends now, okay?

39:59.897 --> 40:00.997
Don't talk to her anymore.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.632
You don't see her anymore,
all right?

40:02.733 --> 40:03.867
Get out of here.

40:06.904 --> 40:10.340
[Det. Witt] And subsequently
Will and Tim killed him.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.716
<i>And then, Will drove Ryan's body</i>

40:19.817 --> 40:22.051
<i>out to the burn barrel</i>

40:22.153 --> 40:26.156
and disposed of his remains
on that gravel pit.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.160
[narrator]<i> Using the same</i>
<i>woods seen on video</i>

40:30.261 --> 40:33.096
<i>in the bed of his truck.</i>

40:33.197 --> 40:36.166
[dramatic music playing]

40:40.070 --> 40:43.306
[narrator]<i> The following day,</i>
<i>Will cleans the truck.</i>

40:43.407 --> 40:45.942
<i>The CCTV is shown to the jury</i>

40:46.043 --> 40:48.745
<i>along with the DNA evidence.</i>

40:48.846 --> 40:50.914
Our role is to find the truth
and present the truth.

40:51.015 --> 40:54.751
And in this case, I think
that's exactly what happened.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.520
[narrator] <i>On April 20th, 2016,</i>

40:57.621 --> 41:00.590
<i>the trio are found guilty
of first degree murder</i>

41:00.691 --> 41:03.426
<i>and are sentenced
to life in prison.</i>

41:04.762 --> 41:06.463
[Det. Witt]
Sheena was the mastermind

41:06.564 --> 41:09.466
behind Ryan's kidnapping
and murder.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.801
<i>In early October of 2011,</i>

41:11.902 --> 41:16.306
<i>Sheena filed
for full custody of Jordan.</i>

41:16.407 --> 41:17.807
<i>Ryan wouldn't consent.</i>

41:17.908 --> 41:20.310
<i>He wanted to be
in Jordan's life.</i>

41:20.411 --> 41:22.679
None of this would have
happened if it wasn't for her

41:22.780 --> 41:24.147
<i>wanting him
to be out of their lives</i>

41:24.248 --> 41:26.149
<i>so that he couldn't interfere</i>

41:26.250 --> 41:29.986
with this new family that
she wanted to start with Tim,

41:30.087 --> 41:33.990
their new baby that was
on the way, and Jordan.

41:34.091 --> 41:35.658
<i>It's just so cold-hearted</i>

41:35.759 --> 41:37.961
<i>that this was the choice
that Sheena made</i>

41:38.062 --> 41:39.829
to deal with her custody issues,

41:39.930 --> 41:42.632
was to kill the father
of her child who now,

41:42.733 --> 41:46.569
<i>for all intents of purposes,
she has neither parents.</i>

41:46.670 --> 41:48.404
It's just a very, very sad case

41:48.506 --> 41:53.243
and it was so all unnecessary.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.211
[narrator]<i> All that's left</i>
<i>for Jordan</i>

41:55.312 --> 41:57.580
<i>are the precious
memories and photos</i>

41:57.681 --> 42:02.151
<i>of time spent
with her loving dad.</i>

42:02.253 --> 42:03.887
[Carla]<i> I just want</i>
<i>Ryan to be remembered</i>

42:03.988 --> 42:05.889
<i>for the fun-loving,
charismatic person</i>

42:05.990 --> 42:08.458
that he was, happy go lucky,

42:08.559 --> 42:11.194
and a father
who loved his daughter.

42:11.295 --> 42:14.163
He was the guy
who always made sure

42:14.265 --> 42:16.799
to tell you that he loves you,

42:16.901 --> 42:20.303
and he made you feel
like he truly did.

42:20.404 --> 42:22.305
[Carla]<i> I just wanna say</i>
<i>thank you, Ryan,</i>

42:22.406 --> 42:23.773
<i>for the years of friendship</i>

42:23.908 --> 42:25.842
<i>that you did give to me
and my buddies,</i>

42:25.943 --> 42:26.976
and we want you to know

42:27.077 --> 42:29.445
that they may have taken you
in time,

42:29.547 --> 42:31.981
but you're still with us
and you always will be

42:32.082 --> 42:34.584
because a true friend
never leaves.
