IT'S THAT TIME

01:35.363 --> 01:37.198
- WHEN YOUR "LITTLE FRIEND"
COMES TO VISIT?

01:37.231 --> 01:39.233
- WHEN EVERY GAY CHARITY
ON THE FUCKING PLANET

01:39.267 --> 01:40.634
TRIES TO HIT ME UP
FOR A TABLE

01:40.668 --> 01:42.636
AT THEIR BENEFIT,
OR AN AD IN THEIR BOOKLET,

01:42.670 --> 01:47.208
OR A SPERM SAMPLE
FOR THEIR SILENT AUCTION.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.277
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S ALSO
THAT TIME OF THE MONTH

01:49.310 --> 01:50.744
FOR MY CREDIT CARD BILLS.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.413
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY ZEROES.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.748
- EXCEPT FOR A MIXER
AT THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.550
- HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO PAY FOR THEM ALL?

01:56.584 --> 01:58.219
- HOW MANY BLOW JOBS
CAN YOU GIVE IN AN HOUR?

01:58.252 --> 01:59.387
- NOT ENOUGH.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.489
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.524
- I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO COME UP
WITH THE CASH SOME OTHER WAY.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.493
- LOOK, WE SOLD ALMOST
3,000 COPIES OF RAGE

02:05.526 --> 02:06.760
ON THE NET
LAST MONTH ALONE.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.795
I COULD GIVE YOU SOME MONEY.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.829
- NO.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.264
- WHY NOT?

02:10.298 --> 02:12.500
- I'M NOT TAKING YOUR MONEY.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.535
- I THOUGHT WE WERE PARTNERS.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.237
- WE ARE.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.805
- THEN WHY WON'T YOU
LET ME GIVE YOU MONEY?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.173
- BECAUSE I DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP.

BUT YOU DRINK LIKE A PRINCE.

MAKE IT TWO.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.725
ON ME.
- KEEP IT.

[glasses clink]

02:45.433 --> 02:46.567

02:46.600 --> 02:48.402
I CAN STILL AFFORD
TO TIE ONE ON

02:48.436 --> 02:50.704
WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE
FROM YOU.

02:50.738 --> 02:54.308
- BRIAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE FUCK YOUR PROBLEM IS.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.977
YOU HELP EVERYONE.

A POLICE STATE

AND NOW,
WHEN YOU NEED HELP--

03:04.352 --> 03:06.820
HEY, TODD.
HOW'S IT GOING?

03:06.854 --> 03:09.223
- FINE.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.424
WHERE WAS I?

03:10.458 --> 03:12.560
- "WHEN--WHEN I NEED HELP"?

03:12.593 --> 03:14.428
- RIGHT.
YOU WON'T TAKE IT.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.330
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY THAT IS?

03:16.364 --> 03:17.865
- POURQUOI?

03:17.898 --> 03:21.569
- BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE THE ONE IN CHARGE,

03:21.602 --> 03:24.972
THE ONE WHO'S IN CONTROL,
THE ONE WHO'S ON TOP.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.607
- MM-HMM.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.709
[both chuckle]

03:28.742 --> 03:31.445

HUH?

- LOOK, I TOLD YOU--

03:35.349 --> 03:36.884
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.019
LIKE I BELIEVE THAT.
- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.754
HE TOOK OFF.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.790
NOT EXACTLY THE FIRST TIME
HE'S RUN AWAY, IS IT?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.492
SO I'D SAY IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
HE'S BACK ON THE STREETS.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.926
- WHAT ABOUT
YOUR LITTLE BOYFRIEND?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.329
HUH? HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE AROUND EITHER.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.797
- HE'S GONE TO FIND HIM.
- [scoffs]

03:49.830 --> 03:51.499
- NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A CLASS.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.867
- OH, AND I HAVE
A CUSTODY HEARING ON TUESDAY.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.769

THERE.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.049
LUNCH IS ON ME.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.317
- BRIAN.
- WHAT?

09:10.350 --> 09:11.919
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TREAT MY FRIENDS?

09:11.952 --> 09:13.220
- BRIAN, IT'S OKAY.
- WE CAN HANDLE IT.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.855
- YEAH, AS SOON AS
YOU GET ANOTHER JOB.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.323
- BY 4:30 THIS AFTERNOON,

09:16.356 --> 09:18.792
I INTEND TO BE REINSTATED
IN MY FORMER POSITION

09:18.826 --> 09:20.861
AND WITH A SIZABLE RAISE.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.062
- VANCE ASKED YOU BACK?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.131
- BRIAN, THAT'S GREAT!
- WOW.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.599
- I'M GOING TO TRY
AND BE AS GRACIOUS

09:25.633 --> 09:27.234
AS LONG AS I POSSIBLY CAN,

09:27.267 --> 09:28.736
THEN I'M GOING TO STICK IT
TO THE MOTHERFUCKER.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.203
YOU CAN KEEP THE CHANGE, DEB.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.940
- * THERE'S A CHANGE
IN THE WEATHER *

09:32.973 --> 09:35.843
* A CHANGE IN THE SEA

09:35.876 --> 09:40.347
* AND FROM NOW ON,
THERE'LL BE A CHANGE IN ME *

09:40.380 --> 09:42.983
* MY WALK WILL BE DIFFERENT

09:43.016 --> 09:46.386
* MY TALK AND MY NAME

09:46.419 --> 09:49.823
* NOTHING ABOUT ME'S
GONNA BE THE SAME *

09:49.857 --> 09:55.228
- I, UH...CRASHED.

09:55.262 --> 10:00.100
I THINK I WAS OUT
FOR A DAY OR SO.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.969
WHEN I FINALLY CAME TO,

10:02.002 --> 10:03.704
THE PARTY WAS STILL GOING ON.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.406
WELL, THE PARTY WAS
ALWAYS GOING ON.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.711
THE GUYS WERE DOWNSTAIRS,
WATCHING PORN.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.113
THE ONES THAT WEREN'T TOO
TWEAKED OUT OF THEIR MINDS,

10:13.146 --> 10:15.649
THAT IS.

10:17.751 --> 10:22.990
AND THEY WERE--
THEY WERE REALLY INTO IT.

10:23.023 --> 10:27.060
IT LOOKED HOT.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.897
SO I DREW A LITTLE OFF

10:29.930 --> 10:34.668
OF DR. C'S PIPE.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.404
AND...

10:37.437 --> 10:41.742
THAT'S WHEN I SAW THE GUY
IN THE VIDEO,

10:41.775 --> 10:45.779
THE ONE GETTING GANG-BANGED.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.229
IT WAS ME.

11:02.262 --> 11:07.034
THAT'S HOW OUT OF CONTROL
I WAS.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.069
GOD ONLY KNOWS IF
THEY WERE USING CONDOMS.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.437
I-I'LL HAVE TO TAKE
A TEST.

11:10.470 --> 11:14.374
I-I DON'T--
[stammers]

11:17.845 --> 11:20.714
I DON'T FEEL VERY OPTIMISTIC.

11:27.955 --> 11:32.192
ANYWAY...

11:32.225 --> 11:34.928
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THAT
IF I--

11:34.962 --> 11:40.734
IF I DIDN'T COME HERE...

11:40.768 --> 11:43.837
I COULD BE DEAD.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.478
- I KNOW HOW HARD
THAT WAS FOR YOU.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.214
JUST REMEMBER,
NOBODY WAS JUDGING YOU

11:54.247 --> 11:57.818
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE
IN OUR OWN WAY.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.087
- WELL, YOUR BEING THERE MADE IT
A WHOLE LOT EASIER.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.254
- I'M GLAD.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.891
- IN FACT,
I-I KEEP THINKING,

12:03.924 --> 12:05.392
YOU KNOW, IF ALL
THIS HADN'T HAPPENED,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.829
IF I HADN'T COME STUMBLING
THROUGH THAT DOOR,

12:08.862 --> 12:13.767
I MEAN, WE MIGHT NOT EVER
HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER AGAIN.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.773
SO, YOU WANT TO--

12:19.807 --> 12:22.509
YOU WANT TO GRAB
SOME LUNCH OR--

12:22.542 --> 12:25.312
- YEAH.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.980
LET ME JUST CHECK
MY MESSAGES,

12:27.014 --> 12:28.982
AND I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE LOUNGE.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.952
- ALL RIGHT.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.010
NOW, THIS IS A SURPRISE.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.546
I THOUGHT
THEY OUTLAWED SHOCK THERAPY.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.481
- HELLO, TEDDY.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.150
- HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

13:03.183 --> 13:05.285
DON'T TELL ME I ENDED UP
IN THE PAPERS AGAIN.

13:05.318 --> 13:09.089
- MEL AND LINZ TOLD ME
YOU'D CHECKED YOURSELF IN.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.091
- OH. HMM.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.425
I THOUGHT
IT WAS ONLY US FAGGOTS

13:12.459 --> 13:17.464
WHO COULDN'T KEEP
OUR MOUTHS SHUT.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.067
- I'M HAPPY,
IF THAT'S THE WORD,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.568
THAT--THAT YOU'RE HERE.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.303
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

13:23.336 --> 13:28.441
NOTHING LIKE A LITTLE R&R
IN A COZY LITTLE B AND B.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.310
- SO, HOW LONG ARE YOU--

13:30.343 --> 13:31.945
- NOT LONG AT ALL. NAH.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.247
FEELING GOOD AS NEW ALREADY.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.582
THEY TELL ME I'M--

13:35.615 --> 13:37.317
I'M MAKING REMARKABLE PROGRESS,
SO--

13:37.350 --> 13:38.919
- GLAD TO HEAR IT.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.588
JUST BE CAREFUL.

13:41.621 --> 13:47.327
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT
TO RUSH IT OR--

13:47.360 --> 13:50.931
- OR WHAT?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.400
- NOTHING.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.236
- OR I'LL WIND UP USING AGAIN?
IS THAT--

13:56.269 --> 13:57.938
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY?

13:57.971 --> 14:00.207
- ALL I MEANT WAS,
Y-Y-YOU KNOW,

14:00.240 --> 14:02.242
BE CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE
THE CUPCAKES

14:02.275 --> 14:07.347
OUT OF THE OVEN
TILL THEY'RE DONE.

14:07.380 --> 14:11.218
- WELL, ISN'T THAT PROFOUND.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.887
AND IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

14:13.921 --> 14:17.390
I'M NOT A CUPCAKE.
OKAY?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.359
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF WINDING UP BACK HERE

14:19.392 --> 14:20.994
IN THE LOSERS' LOUNGE.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.229
- LOOK, I DIDN'T COME HERE

14:22.262 --> 14:23.964
TO UPSET YOU.
- THEN WHY DID YOU?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.265
WHAT, TO JUST SEE FOR YOURSELF
HOW FAR I'VE SUNK?

14:25.298 --> 14:27.000
- NO.
- I TOLD MEL AND LINDSAY

14:27.034 --> 14:28.035
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
VISITING ME.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.970
- SINCE WHEN AM I "ANYONE"?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.371
- HEY, TED, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GRAB SOME LUNCH

14:31.404 --> 14:34.241
BEFORE IT'S ALL GONE.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.376
- BLAKE, UH...

14:36.409 --> 14:39.379
YOU REMEMBER--
- EMMETT.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.248
OF COURSE.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.583
- BACK AGAIN,
OR HAVEN'T YOU EVER LEFT?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.552
- BLAKE ISN'T A PATIENT.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.988
HE'S
A SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELOR,

14:48.021 --> 14:49.990
AND A DAMN GOOD ONE.

14:50.023 --> 14:53.026
- WELL, IF ANYONE KNOWS
HIS STUFF, IT'S YOU.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.928
- YEAH, HE'S BEEN AMAZING.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.263
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD HAVE DONE IF--

14:56.296 --> 14:58.031
IF HE HADN'T BEEN HERE.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.400
- LOOK, I JUST CAME TO
MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,

15:00.433 --> 15:04.037
AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE,
SO...

15:08.075 --> 15:15.215
- * NOW YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY

15:15.248 --> 15:21.021
* FOR BEING SO UNTRUE

15:21.054 --> 15:26.693
* WELL, YOU CAN CRY ME
A RIVER *

15:26.726 --> 15:30.563
* CRY ME A RIVER

15:30.597 --> 15:33.600
* I CRIED A RIVER

15:33.633 --> 15:34.634
* OVER...

15:34.667 --> 15:37.437
- YOU LOOK GREAT.

15:37.470 --> 15:41.708
WHISKEY?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.710
- LITTLE EARLY FOR HAPPY HOUR.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.445
- [sighs]
YOU'RE HERE,

15:45.478 --> 15:48.381
I'M HAPPY.
[glasses clink]

15:52.219 --> 15:54.621
SO DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS?

15:54.654 --> 15:57.457
STOCKWELL WAS INDICTED

15:57.490 --> 16:00.460
IN THE COVER-UP OF
THAT YOUNG MAN'S MURDER.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.463
MAYOR DEEKINS HAS
DEMANDED HIS RESIGNATION.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.998
- OH, MY.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.100
HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.501
- DAMN LUCKY FOR VANGUARD

16:08.535 --> 16:09.736
HE DIDN'T BRING US
DOWN WITH HIM.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.504
- MM-HMM.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.606
- SO...

16:13.640 --> 16:15.775
NAME YOUR PRICE.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.510
- FOR WHAT?

16:17.544 --> 16:19.546
- TO COME BACK, OF COURSE.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.614
WE NEED YOU HERE.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.351
I NEED YOU HERE.
- I DON'T KNOW, GARDNER.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.119
IT'S NOT JUST
A MATTER OF THE MONEY.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.655
THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.491
- HMM?
- [clears throat]

16:31.524 --> 16:33.260
JACUZZI IN MY PRIVATE BATHROOM.

16:33.293 --> 16:36.396
AN UNLIMITED EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.430
- MM-HMM.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.766
- LOYALTY.
- HMM. AH.

16:39.799 --> 16:45.372
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

16:45.405 --> 16:50.343
AND MY HANDSHAKE.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.691
NOW I'LL JUST NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.263
- [scoffs]

17:10.297 --> 17:12.199
NON-COMPETITION CLAUSE?

17:12.232 --> 17:13.666
- IT'S JUST A FORMALITY.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.402
- SO THIS IS
WHY YOU WANTED ME BACK?

17:15.435 --> 17:18.271
YOU'RE AFRAID I WAS GOING
TO RAID THE PANTRY?

17:18.305 --> 17:22.442
AND HERE I THOUGHT IT WAS ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.477
- YOU'RE NOT GIVING YOURSELF
ENOUGH CREDIT.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.814
- I'M GIVING MYSELF
ALL THE CREDIT.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.317
I BROUGHT IN ALL
OF OUR MAJOR ACCOUNTS,

17:30.350 --> 17:31.684
I CREATED THEIR CAMPAIGNS,

17:31.718 --> 17:33.153
I CONVINCED THE WORLD
IT COULDN'T LIVE

17:33.186 --> 17:34.754
WITHOUT THEIR PRODUCTS.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.590
AND THEY WOULD LEAVE WITH ME
FASTER THAN A TEN-SECOND SPOT.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.193
BUT IF I SIGN THIS,
THEY'D ALL BE OFF-LIMITS.

17:40.227 --> 17:44.464
I WOULDN'T COUNT MY CLIENTS
BEFORE THEY'RE SNATCHED.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.503
- HE'S 16, HE'S TALL,

17:50.537 --> 17:53.173
SKINNY, HE'S GOT
LONG, DIRTY BLOND HAIR,

17:53.206 --> 17:55.308
HE'S GOT A BIT OF AN ATTITUDE.

17:55.342 --> 17:59.212
- HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.
SORRY.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.116
[radio playing
Everything I do]

18:03.150 --> 18:06.786
- * EVERYTHING I DO,
I DO FOR YOU *

18:06.819 --> 18:08.588
- HUNTER?

18:08.621 --> 18:10.723
WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.259
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.761
- COME ON, LET'S EAT.
DINNER'S ON ME.

18:14.794 --> 18:18.231
- WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

18:18.265 --> 18:20.233
HOW MANY TRUCKERS
DID YOU HAVE TO FUCK TO GET IT?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.235
- JUST ONE.
AND IT WAS ONLY A BLOW-JOB.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.903
- THAT'S A RELIEF.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.405
HOW COULD YOU?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.407
- HOW COULD I WHAT?
WE'RE BROKE.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.377
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.246
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.
LET'S GO.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.614
- TO MEXICO?
- TO PITTSBURGH.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.649
- NO WAY! YOU PROMISED.
- I'M BREAKING IT.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.551
- NOW COME ON.
- GET THE FUCK OFF ME.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.253
- LISTEN TO ME,
YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE.

18:40.287 --> 18:45.425
I RISKED EVERYTHING FOR YOU!

18:45.458 --> 18:47.660
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO
WHAT I TELL YOU.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.496
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK
AND FIGHT.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.231
AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO TRY AND TURN YOU

18:51.264 --> 18:55.402
INTO A NORMAL HUMAN BEING,
WHICH, AT THE MOMENT,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.770
FLAPPING MY ARMS
AND FLYING TO THE MOON

18:57.804 --> 19:01.208
SEEMS LIKE A BETTER BET.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.143
MOVE IT!

19:11.951 --> 19:16.289
[indistinct chatter]

19:16.323 --> 19:20.427
- HEY, CAN'T YOU SEE
I JUST CLEANED THERE?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.831
- A LITTLE TESTY TONIGHT?

19:24.864 --> 19:28.435
- WHAT DO THEY THINK
I'M DOING THIS FOR, MY HEALTH?

19:28.468 --> 19:30.470
- ACTUALLY, YOU ARE.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.942
- I WONDER IF THEY MADE
ELIZABETH TAYLOR DO THIS.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.411
- ABSOLUTELY.
IN HER DIAMONDS.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.812
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
I'D FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT

19:39.846 --> 19:41.981
IF I WAS WEARING
A 600-CARAT CHOKER.

19:42.014 --> 19:46.719
- I'LL PICK ONE UP FOR YOU
WHILE I'M OUT.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.555
- SORRY.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.724
I'M JUST FEELING A LITTLE--
- UPSET?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.726
- [sighs]

19:53.760 --> 19:55.595
CONSTIPATED, ACTUALLY.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.430
I HAVEN'T HAD A BOWEL MOVEMENT
SINCE I GOT HERE.

19:57.464 --> 20:02.435
SO FORGET THE CHOKER,
JUST BRING ME SOME METAMUCIL.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.004
- LOOK.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.474
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.843
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO
I WAS GOING THROUGH IT MYSELF.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.512
- YEAH.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.316
I KNOW, I REMEMBER
BRINGING YOU HERE.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.450
THEN I CAME BACK
TO SEE YOU AND--

20:17.484 --> 20:20.520
- AND I WAS GONE.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.588
YEAH.

20:21.621 --> 20:25.325
IT WASN'T VERY NICE OF ME.

20:25.358 --> 20:29.362
- IT WAS FUCKING SHITTY.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.731
I CARED ABOUT YOU.

20:31.764 --> 20:36.803
I--

20:36.836 --> 20:39.406
I MORE THAN CARED ABOUT YOU.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.040
- I KNOW.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.377
I-I KNOW. THAT'S--THAT'S
WHY I HAD TO LEAVE.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.647
- TO SPARE ME THE PAIN?
- AND MYSELF.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.617
FROM YOU SEEING ME THAT WAY.

20:50.650 --> 20:54.887
- WELL,
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.525
I'M THE ONE DOWN ON MY HANDS
AND KNEES, SCRUBBING THE FLOOR.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.026
THE ONE THEY ALL COME
TO GAWK AT,

21:00.059 --> 21:02.295
SO THEY CAN FEEL SUPERIOR,
LIKE EMMETT.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.831
- WELL, I'M SURE HE FELT JUST
AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS YOU DID.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.499
- I GUESS IT TAKES SOMETHING
LIKE THIS

21:06.533 --> 21:10.803
FOR A PERSON TO REVEAL
THEIR TRUE COLORS, HUH?

21:10.837 --> 21:13.540
WELL, AT LEAST I HAVE YOU.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.842
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS HOW IT FEELS

21:15.875 --> 21:19.278
AND WHAT IT'S LIKE.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.083
- I HAVE TO GO.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.086
- A HOT DATE?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.322
- ACTUALLY, YEAH.

21:29.356 --> 21:33.693
WE'RE GOING TO SEE LUCIA.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.562
- OH.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.929
THAT'S NICE.
I-I DIDN'T KNOW.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.567
I-I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THAT YOU LIKE OPERA.

21:40.600 --> 21:45.438
- THANKS TO YOU,
I'M HOOKED.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.939
- WELL, AT LEAST
IT'S ONE ADDICTION

21:46.973 --> 21:49.576
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO REHAB FOR, RIGHT?

21:49.609 --> 21:52.579
- GOOD NIGHT.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.582
- HAVE FUN.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.595
[door closes]

22:11.664 --> 22:13.600
- I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU TOO.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.868
- HEY! WHAT ABOUT ME?

22:15.902 --> 22:17.904
- AH, COME HERE, PAL.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.707
HEY, DID YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.842
- HE WAS A PERFECT ANGEL.

22:22.875 --> 22:26.479
- I WAS A PERFECT ANGEL.
- ALL RIGHT. [groans]

22:26.513 --> 22:29.582
THANK GOD YOU'RE BOTH
SAFE AND IN ONE PIECE.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.784
- AT LEAST
IT'S STILL IN ONE PIECE.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.887
- YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW
HUNTER AND I ARE BOTH OKAY TOO.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.726
- UM...

22:39.759 --> 22:42.495
WHAT'S THIS?

22:42.529 --> 22:43.796
- A BURGER BOX.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.164
- YOU ATE IN MY CAR?

22:45.197 --> 22:46.499
- WE WERE IN A HURRY
TO GET HOME.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.501
WE DIDN'T WANT TO STOP.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.471
- SO YOU TURNED MY CAR INTO
A RECYCLING BIN. CHRIST.

22:51.504 --> 22:52.939
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THAT TIME
IN SEVENTH GRADE

22:52.972 --> 22:54.641
WHEN I LENT YOU
MY BRAND-NEW TEN-SPEED.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.743
YOU BROUGHT IT BACK,
THE FRONT FENDER WAS CRUSHED,

22:56.776 --> 22:57.877
MY SEAT WAS TORN.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.614
- I WAS HIT BY A BUS.

23:01.648 --> 23:04.517
- WELL, THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I EVER LOAN YOU--

23:06.218 --> 23:07.820
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

23:07.854 --> 23:09.789
- FOR GIVING ME THE WHEELS
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER YOU

23:09.822 --> 23:12.925
FOR NO GOOD REASON,
OTHER THAN

23:12.959 --> 23:15.695
YOU LOVE ME.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.696
[car horn honks]

23:16.729 --> 23:18.164
- YOU'RE PATHETIC.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.766
AND SO IS THIS CAR.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.501
NOW I HAVE JUST ENOUGH TIME
TO GET IT WASHED.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.803
HOW DO I LOOK?
- LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.104
- DON'T SELL ME SHORT.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.106
- TEN.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.645
- WISH ME LUCK.

23:32.679 --> 23:37.684
- YOU DON'T NEED IT.

23:37.717 --> 23:40.687
[engine turns]

23:43.255 --> 23:46.559
[tires squeal]

23:46.593 --> 23:51.964
- * ARE THE STARS OUT TONIGHT?

23:51.998 --> 23:56.669
* I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
CLOUDY OR BRIGHT

23:56.703 --> 24:01.574
* 'CAUSE I ONLY HAVE EYES

24:01.608 --> 24:04.243
* FOR YOU

24:04.276 --> 24:06.746
[indistinct chatter]

24:06.779 --> 24:10.750
- BECAUSE I CONSIDER YOU TO BE
MY MOST IMPORTANT CLIENT.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.853
BECAUSE I REGARD YOU
AS MY MOST VALUABLE ACCOUNT.

24:13.886 --> 24:14.954
BECAUSE NO ONE'S
CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP

24:14.987 --> 24:16.623
MEANS MORE TO ME THAN YOURS.

24:16.656 --> 24:21.227
I WANTED YOU TO BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW...

24:21.260 --> 24:23.095
I'M STARTING MY OWN AGENCY.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.697
- THAT'S GREAT NEWS, BRIAN.

24:24.731 --> 24:25.732
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, BRIAN.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.567
- WAY TO GO, PARTNER!

24:27.600 --> 24:29.035
- IT'S A BIG STEP, I KNOW.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.103
BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT
BY FOCUSING ON

24:31.137 --> 24:33.573
A SMALL,
SELECT LIST OF CLIENTS,

24:33.606 --> 24:34.974
I CAN STILL PROVIDE
THE SAME INNOVATIVE CAMPAIGNS

24:35.007 --> 24:36.275
YOU'VE COME TO EXPECT,

24:36.308 --> 24:38.144
BUT WITH THE PERSONAL ATTENTION

24:38.177 --> 24:40.046
ONLY A BOUTIQUE OPERATION
CAN OFFER.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.614
- SOUNDS LIKE A HELL OF A PLAN.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.149
- WELL, IF ANYONE CAN PULL
THIS OFF, BRIAN,

24:43.182 --> 24:44.917
YOU CAN.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.919
- I LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING,
PARTNER.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.055
- AND THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE
TO PUT EYE-CONIC OPTICS...

24:49.088 --> 24:50.723
I WANT BROWN ATHLETICS...

24:50.757 --> 24:52.725
FRAWLEY OPEN-FIRE STEAK
HOUSES...

24:52.759 --> 24:56.262
AT THE VERY TOP OF MY LIST.

24:56.295 --> 25:04.170
- * AND I ONLY HAVE EYES

25:04.203 --> 25:12.011
* FOR YOU

25:12.044 --> 25:14.046
- WANT TO PASS THE ZITI,
SWEETIE?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.082
[kisses]
- SURE, MA.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.917
- SEE HOW NICE SHE'S BEING?

25:17.950 --> 25:19.085
THAT'S HOW I KNOW.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.888
- WHAT?
- THAT SHE'S PISSED.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.691
SHE'S JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.025
[knock on door]

25:26.058 --> 25:27.627
- RIGHT THERE!

25:27.660 --> 25:32.832
- WILL YOU SIT DOWN
AND FINISH EATING ALREADY?

25:32.865 --> 25:33.933
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.034
- HI.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.936
- HI.
- JESUS CHRIST!

25:36.969 --> 25:38.337
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TWO SUPPOSED TO BE?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.106
- I'M MOTHER SUPERIOR.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.041
- AND I'M FRIEDRICH.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.945
- I CAN ONLY DREAM OF WHAT
PERVERSIONS GO ON IN YOUR HOUSE.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.648
- LET ME GUESS: THE
SING-A-LONG SOUND OF MUSIC.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.082
- IT WAS A BENEFIT
FOR PEDIATRIC AIDS.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.183
- I BET YOU WORKED UP
AN APPETITE

25:51.217 --> 25:52.318
CLIMBING ALL THOSE MOUNTAINS.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.686
SIT DOWN, EAT.
- NO, NO, NO.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.954
WE DIDN'T COME TO EAT.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.956
HUNTER, GIVE ME A DOLLAR.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.257
- YOU SHORT OF CASH, HONEY?

25:58.290 --> 25:59.959
VIC, GET THE TEA CANISTER.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.193
- NO, IT HAS TO COME
FROM HUNTER.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.062
- WHAT FOR?
- I PETITIONED THE COURT

26:03.095 --> 26:04.864
TO APPOINT ME
YOUR GUARDIAN AD LITEM.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.232
- MY WHAT?

26:06.265 --> 26:08.200
- IT MEANS I CAN REPRESENT YOU
AT THE HEARING,

26:08.234 --> 26:10.069
EXPLAIN TO THE JUDGE WHY YOUR
MOTHER SHOULDN'T GET CUSTODY,

26:10.102 --> 26:11.838
AND WHY IT'S IN
YOUR BEST INTEREST

26:11.871 --> 26:15.074
TO REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE,
WITH MICHAEL AND BEN.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.009
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

26:17.043 --> 26:18.344
- FUCK, YEAH.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.012
[laughter]

26:20.046 --> 26:23.015
- YOU SEE? I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD
DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.084
- YEAH, INSTEAD OF RUNNING OFF
WITHOUT TELLING YOUR MOTHER.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.085
[slaps]
- OH.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.954
- OW.
- [laughs]

26:27.987 --> 26:30.256
- I TOLD YOU.
- YES, YOU DID.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.759
[indistinct chatter]

26:32.792 --> 26:36.095
- BY THE TIME YOU'RE DONE
DECIMATING HIS CLIENT LIST,

26:36.128 --> 26:37.697
VANCE WILL BE ASKING YOU
FOR A JOB.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.298
- AH, WE'LL SEE.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.399
- STOP BEING MODEST.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.234
- I WAS AIMING FOR SMUG.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.369
- HOW DO YOU LIKE THE NAME
I PICKED OUT

26:43.402 --> 26:46.973
FOR YOUR NEW AGENCY?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.708
- "KINNETIK."

26:48.741 --> 26:50.042
- WITH TWO Ns.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.211
- THAT'S CLEVER.
- IT'S GENIUS.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.421
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT IF NO ONE'S SITTING HERE,

27:02.454 --> 27:04.156
I WAS WONDERING--
- LOOK, I'M--

27:04.190 --> 27:05.792
I'M VERY FLATTERED
YOU SHOULD ASK,

27:05.825 --> 27:07.159
SO DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

27:07.193 --> 27:09.261
BUT FUCK OFF.

27:09.295 --> 27:13.065
- I WAS GOING TO ASK IF
I COULD BORROW THE STOOL.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.801
ASSHOLE.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.435
- BUY YOU A DRINK?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.337
- I'M VERY FLATTERED
YOU SHOULD ASK,

27:18.370 --> 27:20.339
SO DON'T TAKE--

27:20.372 --> 27:23.209
HELLO, BOYS.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.077
- SORRY, MISS DIETRICH,
I MISTOOK YOU FOR MY FRIEND,

27:25.111 --> 27:26.779
EMMETT HONEYCUTT.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.081
- WE'RE GOING TO BABYLON.
YOU WANT TO COME?

27:29.115 --> 27:32.018
- OH, I'M NOT REALLY
IN THE MOOD FOR MEN,

27:32.051 --> 27:33.920
OR MUSCLES, OR MUSIC.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.188
I'D RATHER STAY HERE,
GET SHIT-FACED.

27:36.222 --> 27:39.225
- WELL, YOU PASSED SHIT-FACED
ABOUT TEN MILES BACK.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.193
- SO I'VE HAD A FEW COCKTAILS.

27:41.227 --> 27:44.163
WHAT, DOES THAT--DOES
THAT QUALIFY ME FOR REHAB?

27:44.196 --> 27:46.298
BESIDES,
I'VE ALREADY BEEN THERE.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.034
- DID YOU SEE TED?

27:48.067 --> 27:51.771
- AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHO'S THERE WITH HIM.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.840
- LIZA?
- ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.775
- BEN AFFLECK.
- MATTHEW PERRY?

27:55.808 --> 27:58.177
BLAKE,
THE TWEAKED-OUT TWINKIE!

27:58.210 --> 27:59.211
[chuckles]
- AH.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.914
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?

28:01.948 --> 28:03.182
- YOU KNOW,
SOME ASSHOLES NEVER LEARN.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.851
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HE'S LEARNED.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.219
HE'S EVEN GOTTEN A DEGREE.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.956
HE'S A DRUG ABUSE COUNSELOR.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.724
YEAH.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.926
A FEW DAYS
IN DR. BOYTOY'S CARE

28:13.960 --> 28:16.863
AND MR. SCHMIDT'S
AS GOOD AS NEW.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.364
LET'S--
[clears throat]

28:18.397 --> 28:20.967
LET'S HAVE A DRINK
TO HIS REMARKABLE RECOVERY.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.203
SHALL WE? HMM.

28:24.236 --> 28:29.175
[both moaning]

28:52.899 --> 28:54.500
- OH, GOD.

28:54.533 --> 28:57.469
[moaning]

29:05.277 --> 29:08.180
OH, GOD, OH.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.269
- OH.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.404
AH. [laughs]

29:32.438 --> 29:34.540
- MM.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.109
[both moan]

29:41.180 --> 29:44.583
- STOP IT.
YOU KNOW THAT DRIVES ME NUTS.

29:44.616 --> 29:48.487
- [chuckles]
DOES IT?

29:48.520 --> 29:51.057
THEN HOW ABOUT WE GO AGAIN?

29:51.090 --> 29:54.060
- THAT'D MAKE THREE.

29:54.093 --> 29:58.230
- GOD,
I MISSED KISSING YOU.

29:58.264 --> 30:02.201
HOLDING YOU.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.509
WHAT?

30:10.542 --> 30:15.614
- I'M JUST LOOKING.

30:15.647 --> 30:20.386
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

30:20.419 --> 30:26.125
- YOU'RE KIND OF CUTE YOURSELF.

30:26.158 --> 30:30.062
- SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY--

30:30.096 --> 30:36.002
I MEAN HOW YOU COULD
EVER LOVE ME.

30:36.035 --> 30:41.073
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:41.107 --> 30:44.476
- I FEEL LIKE SUCH AN IDIOT.

30:44.510 --> 30:48.080
RUNNING OFF WITH HUNTER
THE WAY I DID.

30:48.114 --> 30:52.118
I SHOULD'VE JUST STAYED HERE,
LIKE YOU SAID,

30:52.151 --> 30:54.153
INSTEAD OF PUTTING
EVERYBODY THROUGH

30:54.186 --> 30:57.223
MIKEY AND HUNTER'S
EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.158
IT WAS SO NOT COOL.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.493
IT WAS SO IMMATURE.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.163
AND WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE
IS THAT TO GIVE TO A KID?

31:04.196 --> 31:05.431
- HOLD IT.

31:05.464 --> 31:08.534
WHAT YOU DID WAS INCREDIBLE.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.504
- IT WAS?

31:12.538 --> 31:15.674
- NOT ONLY DO I ADMIRE YOU

31:15.707 --> 31:20.246
FOR HAVING THE BALLS
TO DO IT,

31:20.279 --> 31:24.416
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF JEALOUS.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.452
- JEALOUS?

31:26.485 --> 31:29.055
- HOW YOU PUT HUNTER'S SAFETY
ABOVE YOUR OWN,

31:29.088 --> 31:32.658
WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.660
I WOULDN'T CALL THAT IMMATURE.

31:34.693 --> 31:39.398
I WOULD CALL THAT...

31:39.431 --> 31:41.567
LOVE.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.690
- IT'S A SPECIAL PLACE.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.326
- SPECIAL AS IN UNIQUE,

32:07.359 --> 32:09.561
FABULOUS, ONE-OF-A-KIND?
OR SPECIAL AS IN,

32:09.595 --> 32:13.199
"THERE ARE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY
CAN TEACH HIM TO DRESS HIMSELF"?

32:13.232 --> 32:15.167
- MOM?
- HI, HONEY.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.168
- HI, HONEY.

32:16.202 --> 32:19.038
- I MEAN SPECIAL AS IN,

32:19.071 --> 32:20.372
IT'S FOR
A CERTAIN KIND OF PERSON.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.209
A PERSON WHO'S,
UM, HAS NO CHILDREN,

32:23.242 --> 32:24.710
WHO'S SINGLE,

32:24.743 --> 32:27.579
A PERSON WHO--
LET'S FACE IT, BRIAN.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.981
IT'S A FUCKPAD.

32:29.015 --> 32:31.617
- MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

32:31.650 --> 32:33.385
- SO HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
I CAN GET FOR IT?

32:33.419 --> 32:35.487
- GET FOR WHAT?

32:35.521 --> 32:37.123
- I'M SELLING THE LOFT.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.325
- WHAT?

32:39.358 --> 32:41.193
- WELL, IT WAS EITHER CUT
MY EXPENSES OR CUT MY WRISTS.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.529
SO I'VE JUST OPTED
FOR THE TIDIER OF THE TWO.

32:43.562 --> 32:47.133
- LISTEN, I'LL CALL YOU LATER
WITH SOME COMPS.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.334
WE CAN SET A PRICE.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.602
HEY, DARLING.

32:50.636 --> 32:54.073
AND I WON'T BE CHARGING
COMMISSION.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.641
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE
FOR JUSTIN,

32:55.674 --> 33:00.346
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.414
- YOU'RE NOT SELLING YOUR LOFT.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.483
IT'S YOUR HOME.
- NOT FOR LONG.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.618
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE STARTING
YOUR OWN AGENCY,

33:06.652 --> 33:08.487
THAT YOUR CLIENTS
WERE GOING TO GO WITH YOU.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.789
- YEAH, WELL,
THEY TURNED ME DOWN.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.092
BEST LAID PLANS
OF MICE AND AD-MEN.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.660
- THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.028
A LOAN.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.230
- $100,000
IN DEBT AND UNEMPLOYED?

33:18.264 --> 33:19.765
I'M NOT EXACTLY
A VERY GOOD RISK.

33:19.798 --> 33:22.234
- GET A JOB
AT ANOTHER AGENCY.

33:22.268 --> 33:25.237
- YEAH. I DO HAVE AN OFFER.
IT'S IN SCRANTON.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.772
IT'S AT HALF MY SALARY.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.640
- OH, CHRIST.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.643
YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO ME.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.380
- I-I DIDN'T.
I LISTENED TO ME.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.116
- BESIDES, IT'S JUST FOUR WALLS
AND A FLOOR.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.251
AND TOP-OF-THE-LINE APPLIANCES

33:39.285 --> 33:41.187
AND STAINLESS STEEL COUNTERTOPS.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.122
AND IMPORTED ITALIAN FIXTURES.

33:43.155 --> 33:46.425
- IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.727
IT'S WHERE WE MADE LOVE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.662
- THAT WASN'T LOVE.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.699
I JUST GAVE YOU A RIM-JOB
AND FUCKED YOUR BRAINS OUT.

33:53.732 --> 33:57.303
- MM.

33:57.336 --> 34:00.306
IT WAS LOVE TO ME.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.351
- VIC.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.687
VIC!

34:15.721 --> 34:17.823
DO--DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?

34:17.856 --> 34:21.293
- I GUESS WE COULD GIVE
EACH GUEST A CLAW AND A STRAW,

34:21.327 --> 34:24.430
LET HIM SUCK THE MEAT OUT.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.098
- WHAT I NEED IS AN ADVIL.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.566
OR A GUN.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.568
- SOMEONE HAD
A FEW TOO MANY LAST NIGHT.

34:29.601 --> 34:30.836
- [groans]

34:30.869 --> 34:34.373
- HOW ABOUT I WASH
THE GREENS, GENTLY?

34:37.209 --> 34:39.445
WHERE'S THE FUCKING STRAINER?

34:39.478 --> 34:42.448
I CAN'T FIND A THING
IN THIS GODDAMN KITCHEN.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.650
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH MY GODDAMN KITCHEN?

34:44.683 --> 34:46.785
- WE HAD EVERYTHING
WE NEEDED OVER AT TED'S.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.188
- SO GO TO TED'S.
- WE CAN'T GO TO TED'S.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.223
- WOULD YOU TWO, PLEASE?

34:51.257 --> 34:54.593
MAKE A LIST
AND I'LL PICK EVERYTHING UP.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.396
[both mouthing silently]

34:57.429 --> 35:01.567
[pills rattling]

35:12.378 --> 35:15.781
- WE WON THE SWEEPSTAKES.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.752
OPENING OF A NEW Q-MART.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.388
FUNDRAISER FOR THE CENTER.

35:22.421 --> 35:27.893
CHRIST, ANOTHER ONE?

35:27.926 --> 35:29.495
OH.

35:29.528 --> 35:33.232
LOOK, VIC.
YOU GOT A POSTCARD.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.767
FROM MICHELANGELO.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.270
- THAT MUST'VE BEEN LOST
IN THE MAIL A LONG TIME.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.639
- ACTUALLY, WE MET AT
A FAIRY GATHERING.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.442
- THE TONY AWARDS?
- HUH!

35:43.475 --> 35:46.412
- IT'S A GROUP OF GAY MEN
WHO GATHER IN THE WOODS

35:46.445 --> 35:49.181
TO REDISCOVER
OUR SPIRIT OF JOY.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.183
- AND GET LAID IN THE BUSHES.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.651
- MICHELANGELO
ISN'T HIS REAL NAME.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.386
IT'S HIS FAIRY NAME.
WE ALL HAD THEM.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.922
MINE WAS--
- CHERUB.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.390
- [snorts]

35:58.424 --> 36:00.392
- I WENT RIGHT AFTER
I WAS DIAGNOSED.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.693
I WAS DEVASTATED.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.396
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW I COULD GO ON,

36:04.430 --> 36:06.798
SO I SWALLOWED MY SKEPTICISM.

36:06.832 --> 36:11.937
TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST
HEALING EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.673
- YOU KNOW, HONEY,
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.343
- RUNNING AROUND IN THE WOODS
WITH A BUNCH OF FAIRIES?

36:17.376 --> 36:22.481
THANKS,
BUT I'LL STICK TO ADVIL.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.717
- [laughs]
- "STOCKWELL INDICTED."

36:25.751 --> 36:29.455
- SEEING A HEADLINE LIKE THAT
RESTORES MY FAITH IN HUMANITY.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.557
- MAKES ME WANT TO BUY SHOES.
- [laughs]

36:31.590 --> 36:34.326
- BIRKENSTOCKS?
- OH. MANOLOS.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.428
BUT SINCE WE'RE SAVING UP
FOR THE NEW ARRIVAL,

36:36.462 --> 36:38.597
I'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER
MEANS TO EXPRESS MY JOY.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.233
- MM-HMM.
- WE ALL HAVE BRIAN TO THANK.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.734
- HE IS THE WIZARD OF OZ.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.836
- THERE WASN'T ANY WIZARD.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.639
THERE ISN'T ANY "CONCERNED
CITIZENS FOR THE TRUTH."

36:47.673 --> 36:50.609
BRIAN PAID FOR THAT COMMERCIAL
AGAINST STOCKWELL HIMSELF.

36:50.642 --> 36:51.743
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.979
- NOW HE'S $100,000 IN DEBT.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.315
HE HAS TO SELL OFF EVERYTHING
HE OWNS,

36:56.348 --> 36:58.884
EVEN THE LOFT.
- WOW.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.519
NEVER DREAMED
I'D BE SAYING THIS,

37:00.552 --> 37:03.322
BUT I WISH
THERE WAS SOMETHING WE COULD DO.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.624
- I TRIED OFFERING HIM
THE MONEY I MADE FROM RAGE,

37:05.657 --> 37:06.792
BUT HE WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.661
- HE'S TOO PROUD FOR THAT.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.730
- SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO?

37:11.763 --> 37:14.866
STAND AROUND AND WATCH
WHILE HE LOSES EVERYTHING?

37:14.900 --> 37:16.768
- IT'S HIS CHOICE.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.638
- "IT'S HIS CHOICE"?
THAT'S IT?

37:19.671 --> 37:21.607
I THOUGHT YOU CARED ABOUT HIM.
- I DO.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.910
BUT I ALSO KNOW BRIAN WOULD
NEVER BE BEHOLDEN TO ANYONE.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.350
- YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU,
YOUR HONOR,

37:31.383 --> 37:32.618
MRS. MONTGOMERY'S
SOCIAL WORKER'S REPORT,

37:32.651 --> 37:33.819
INCLUDING
A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION,

37:33.852 --> 37:35.621
TESTIMONY
FROM HER NEW EMPLOYER,

37:35.654 --> 37:37.689
A SIGNED LEASE
FOR HER APARTMENT RENTAL,

37:37.723 --> 37:40.292
AND AN APPROVED
CREDIT CARD APPLICATION.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.394
- DID HE INCLUDE
HER GIRL SCOUT BADGE?

37:42.428 --> 37:43.829
- HOPEFULLY, UPON REVIEWING
THESE DOCUMENTS,

37:43.862 --> 37:45.664
YOUR HONOR WILL CONCUR
THAT MRS. MONTGOMERY

37:45.697 --> 37:47.366
HAS TAKEN ADMIRABLE INITIATIVE

37:47.399 --> 37:48.700
IN OVERCOMING SEVERE HARDSHIP,

37:48.734 --> 37:50.902
SO THAT JAMES MAY BE RETURNED
TO HER CARE.

37:50.936 --> 37:51.970
- MIND IF I HEAVE?

37:52.003 --> 37:53.939
- DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.675
- [whispers]
JUST SIT THERE AND SHUT UP.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.076
- YOUR HONOR.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.579
- MS. MARCUS.
- I DON'T MEAN TO DIMINISH

38:00.612 --> 38:02.381
RITA MONTGOMERY'S
ADMIRABLE INITIATIVE,

38:02.414 --> 38:04.450
BUT YOU'LL ALSO FIND
ANOTHER SET OF DOCUMENTS,

38:04.483 --> 38:06.718
INCLUDING HER ARREST
FOR STABBING HER HUSBAND,

38:06.752 --> 38:08.387
TESTIMONY FROM
NEIGHBORS RECOUNTING

38:08.420 --> 38:09.921
HER REPEATED DRUG ABUSE,

38:09.955 --> 38:12.090
AS WELL AS A STATEMENT
FROM HER OWN SON

38:12.123 --> 38:14.993
DESCRIBING HOW SHE COERCED HIM
FROM THE AGE OF 12 ON

38:15.026 --> 38:16.928
INTO ACTS OF PROSTITUTION.
- THAT'S NOT--

38:16.962 --> 38:19.565
- THAT'S NOT TRUE!
- THE FUCK IT'S NOT!

38:19.598 --> 38:21.467
- YOUNG MAN, PLEASE ALLOW
YOUR LAWYER TO SPEAK FOR YOU.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.701
THAT'S WHAT
SHE'S BEING PAID FOR.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.835
- YEAH. A BUCK.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.337
- NOW SHE WANTS HIM BACK.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.072
WELL, I CONTEND
RITA MONTGOMERY

38:27.105 --> 38:28.740
IS UNFIT TO BE JAMES'S MOTHER,

38:28.774 --> 38:30.542
AND IT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL
TO HIS PHYSICAL

38:30.576 --> 38:32.077
AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING
TO BE RETURNED

38:32.110 --> 38:34.546
TO HER SO-CALLED CARE.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.415
- YOUR HONOR, MAY I--
NO, MR. LANDREY, YOU MAY NOT.

38:36.448 --> 38:39.084
I'D LIKE TO EXAMINE
ALL DOCUMENTS IN MY CHAMBERS.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.086
I'M CALLING
A 15-MINUTE RECESS.

38:41.119 --> 38:44.022
- ALL RISE.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.904
- SALMON POACHER.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.873
POPOVER PAN.

39:07.413 --> 39:08.647
STRAINER.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.482
STRAINER, STRAINER, STRAINER...

39:10.516 --> 39:11.717
- UNDER THE SINK.

39:11.750 --> 39:15.120
- JESUS-FUCKING-
MARY-AND-JOSEPH!

39:15.153 --> 39:17.589
OH, YOU SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

39:17.623 --> 39:21.059
- SORRY.
- [exhales]

39:21.092 --> 39:23.995
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BACK.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.765
VIC NEEDED SOME THINGS, SO--

39:26.798 --> 39:31.369
- DON'T MIND ME. JUST TAKE
WHATEVER YOU WANT AND, UH...

39:35.173 --> 39:36.942
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:36.975 --> 39:40.178
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE IN--
- IN REHAB?

39:40.211 --> 39:42.681
YEAH. I LEFT.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.049
- KUDOS TO YOUR COUNSELOR.

39:44.082 --> 39:47.553
MUST BE THE FASTEST CURE
ON RECORD.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.954
- WHAT WITH THE COST OF HEALTH
CARE THESE DAYS,

39:48.987 --> 39:51.690
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU
TO LINGER TOO LONG.

39:51.723 --> 39:56.662
IN FACT, THEY'RE THINKING OF
PUTTING IN A DRIVE-THRU WINDOW.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.065
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

40:00.098 --> 40:02.534
A DRIVE-THRU WINDOW?

40:02.568 --> 40:05.704
- YEAH, TEDDY.
YOU'RE A REAL SCREAM.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.440
AFRAID I-I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'VE
HAD MORE LAUGHS THAN WITH YOU.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.909
- WELL, YOU MUST FEEL REAL GOOD
THAT THE LAST ONE'S ON ME.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.812
HOW I'VE MANAGED
TO TOTALLY FUCK UP MY LIFE.

40:13.845 --> 40:18.049
- SORRY.
DON'T PLAN PITY PARTIES.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.520
- I'M NOT ASKING FOR YOUR PITY.
I'M JUST STATING A FACT.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.989
- WELL, THEN HERE'S
ANOTHER ONE.

40:24.022 --> 40:28.093
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER
SITTING ON THE SOFA.

40:28.126 --> 40:31.196
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR SARDONIC WIT

40:31.229 --> 40:33.865
AND YOUR SUPERIOR, "I'M NOT LIKE
THOSE OTHER LOSERS" ATTITUDE

40:33.899 --> 40:36.702
AND GET YOUR ASS BACK THERE.

40:36.735 --> 40:40.606
- WHAT? SO THEY CAN FIX ME?

40:40.639 --> 40:42.941
IT'S TOO LATE.

40:42.974 --> 40:48.480
I'M BEYOND REPAIR.

40:48.514 --> 40:51.149
I HAVE NOTHING.

40:51.182 --> 40:56.488
NO FUTURE, NO FRIENDS.

40:56.522 --> 41:01.126
NO JOB, NO LOVER.

41:01.159 --> 41:04.830
WHAT'S THE POINT?

41:04.863 --> 41:08.033
I MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.136
- THEN DO IT.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.171
- WHAT?

41:13.204 --> 41:16.274
- I SAID, "THEN DO IT."

41:16.307 --> 41:17.843
GO ON.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.245
KILL YOURSELF.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.180
DOING US ALL A FAVOR.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.849
ONLY, UH--

41:23.882 --> 41:27.653
ONLY, DON'T BE A MAN
ABOUT IT.

41:27.686 --> 41:30.188
BE A QUEEN.
[opera music playing]

41:30.221 --> 41:32.023
A LITTLE MOOD MUSIC.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.124
YEAH.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.926
AND, OH.
HERE, IT'S, UH--

41:34.960 --> 41:38.196
IT'S NOT QUITE A DAGGER,
BUT IT'LL DO IN A PINCH.

41:38.229 --> 41:41.266
GO ON.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.768
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

41:42.801 --> 41:47.005
YOU CAN FINALLY BE
MARIA CALLAS. HMM?

41:47.038 --> 41:50.275
PLUNGE IT INTO YOUR HEART,
LIKE TOSCA.

41:50.308 --> 41:53.011
- TOSCA DIDN'T STAB HERSELF.
SHE JUMPED OFF A ROOF.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.146
- EVEN BETTER.

41:55.180 --> 42:00.185
FEEL FREE TO SCREAM
OR SING AS LOUD AS YOU WANT.

42:00.218 --> 42:04.790
BECAUSE NOBODY'S LISTENING.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.662
[slams door]

42:10.696 --> 42:13.832
*

42:13.865 --> 42:15.066
- HAVING REVIEWED
ALL THE DOCUMENTS,

42:15.100 --> 42:17.302
THERE'S NO DOUBT,
MRS. MONTGOMERY,

42:17.335 --> 42:18.837
THAT ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE,

42:18.870 --> 42:21.840
AS WELL AS A VIOLENT HOME LIFE,
MADE YOU UNFIT

42:21.873 --> 42:24.810
TO GIVE YOUR SON
THE PROPER CARE HE DESERVED.

42:24.843 --> 42:27.112
STILL, THERE'S EVERY INDICATION
THAT YOU'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES

42:27.145 --> 42:30.081
TO BREAK FREE FROM YOUR PAST.

42:30.115 --> 42:33.084
IT IS ALSO MY OVERWHELMING
PERSONAL FEELING

42:33.118 --> 42:35.654
THAT A CHILD BELONGS
WITH ITS NATURAL PARENT,

42:35.687 --> 42:37.088
AS LONG AS THAT PARENT
CAN PROVIDE

42:37.122 --> 42:39.658
A SAFE AND NURTURING
ENVIRONMENT.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.927
THIS COURT IS THEREFORE WILLING
TO GIVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE

42:41.960 --> 42:43.695
BY GRANTING YOU
CUSTODY OF JAMES.

42:43.729 --> 42:44.930
- [sighs]

42:44.963 --> 42:46.965
THANK YOU.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.334

I'M GOING WITH HER!

42:51.102 --> 42:52.804

I'LL BE FORCED

42:52.838 --> 42:54.139
TO HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.140

CAN'T WAIT TO TURN IT
INTO A MOROCCAN BORDELLO.

44:08.046 --> 44:09.447

"SEND A TRANNY TO SUMMER CAMP"?

44:18.189 --> 44:19.424

TO GIVE THEIR MONEY AWAY.

45:08.974 --> 45:12.878
- IT'S FOR A WORTHY CAUSE.

45:15.113 --> 45:17.215
- WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON HERE?

45:17.248 --> 45:18.416
- WE'RE HAVING
A LITTLE FUNDRAISER

45:18.449 --> 45:23.088

PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM.

45:25.190 --> 45:28.093
"CONCERNED CITIZENS
FOR THE TRUTH"?

45:28.126 --> 45:31.096
YOU SEE, THEY'VE MADE
A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION

45:31.129 --> 45:32.831
TO OUR COMMUNITY.

45:32.864 --> 45:35.233

45:35.266 --> 45:38.236
AND NOW WE HEAR
THEY'RE IN NEED OF,

45:38.269 --> 45:42.173
WELL, A LITTLE HELP
THEMSELVES.

45:42.207 --> 45:44.109
SO, WE, THE COMMUNITY,

45:44.142 --> 45:46.978
WOULD LIKE TO GIVE
SOMETHING BACK.

45:47.012 --> 45:50.515
IT MAY NOT BE
ALL THAT THEY NEED,

45:50.548 --> 45:53.852
BUT IT'S A START.

45:53.885 --> 45:57.789
WE'RE HOPING
YOU'LL ACCEPT THIS

45:57.823 --> 46:00.125
ON THEIR BEHALF.

46:00.158 --> 46:05.063
[applause]

46:10.435 --> 46:13.338
GO ON, OPEN IT.

THE TRUTH" FOR A SHORT TIME.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.427
BUT, UM...

46:36.461 --> 46:38.029
I'VE KNOWN THEM LONG ENOUGH
TO KNOW

46:38.063 --> 46:42.901

TO ACCEPT HANDOUTS.

46:42.934 --> 46:45.203
UH, CHARITABLE DONATIONS.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.210
BUT I GUESS THIS TIME I'M JUST

46:52.243 --> 46:54.846
TO TELL THEM THAT
ONCE IN A WHILE,

46:54.880 --> 46:57.048
WE COULD ALL USE
A LITTLE HELP,

46:57.082 --> 47:00.585
AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO SWALLOW

47:00.618 --> 47:01.619
THEIR FUCKING PRIDE

47:01.652 --> 47:07.325
AND SAY...

47:07.358 --> 47:10.461
THANK YOU.

47:10.495 --> 47:11.930

[laughter]

47:30.181 --> 47:31.616

47:31.649 --> 47:33.484
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HIT
SOME AFTER-HOURS CLUBS?

47:33.518 --> 47:37.022
- EXCUSE ME, YOUNG MAN?
- YOU'VE GOT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

47:37.055 --> 47:38.356
- CHRIST, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE GOING TO TURN

47:38.389 --> 47:39.557
INTO MY GODDAMN PARENTS.

47:39.590 --> 47:41.292

AN EYE ON YOU,

47:45.596 --> 47:47.966
JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU DO.
