00:08.294 --> 00:10.360
My name is Nathan Fielder,

00:10.375 --> 00:13.377
and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools

00:13.424 --> 00:15.724
with really good grades.

00:15.824 --> 00:17.690
Now I'm using my knowledge

00:17.790 --> 00:19.824
to help struggling small
business owners make it

00:19.924 --> 00:22.490
in this competitive world.

00:22.590 --> 00:26.524
This is "Nathan for You."

00:26.624 --> 00:28.924
If you're a fan of delicious chili,

00:29.024 --> 00:31.057
there's a small chance
you've heard of the Lie-N-Den

00:31.157 --> 00:33.780
Bar & Grill in Bakersfield, California,

00:33.882 --> 00:35.882
where owner Robert
Bryan has been serving up

00:35.982 --> 00:39.782
his famous family chili
recipe for decades.

00:39.882 --> 00:41.149
Just about done.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.482
Robert's longtime dream

00:42.582 --> 00:44.215
has been to sell his chili

00:44.315 --> 00:46.215
to the hordes of hungry hockey fans

00:46.315 --> 00:48.815
who attend Bakersfield
Condors home games

00:48.915 --> 00:51.582
at the nearby Rabobank Arena,

00:51.682 --> 00:53.582
but so far, he hasn't had much luck.

00:53.682 --> 00:55.149
I did call Rabobank Arena.

00:55.249 --> 00:56.649
I asked them,

00:56.749 --> 00:59.149
"How would I get on your vendor list?"

00:59.249 --> 01:01.215
"Oh, we have our own vendors.

01:01.315 --> 01:04.015
We don't have a list." So.

01:04.114 --> 01:05.749
I tasted his chili just to make sure

01:05.849 --> 01:08.149
it was as good as he said, and it was.

01:08.249 --> 01:09.382
Mmm.

01:09.482 --> 01:10.715
The flavors and spices

01:10.815 --> 01:12.749
felt awesome against my tongue,

01:12.849 --> 01:14.715
and I was stunned that Rabobank Arena

01:14.815 --> 01:16.249
turned him away,

01:16.349 --> 01:17.382
but fortunately, I had a plan

01:17.482 --> 01:19.015
to get him in the door.

01:19.115 --> 01:21.949
I have a pretty good handle on the law,

01:22.015 --> 01:24.215
from, you know, just
experiences I've had.

01:24.315 --> 01:26.115
- Okay.
- And here's the thing.

01:26.215 --> 01:29.282
If they never know that
you're selling chili,

01:29.382 --> 01:32.815
then what's the consequence?

01:32.949 --> 01:34.715
Well, I don't know how I would sell it

01:34.815 --> 01:36.582
without them... without their knowledge.

01:36.682 --> 01:39.082
Although it violates
the stadium's policy,

01:39.182 --> 01:42.249
there's no law against sneaking
chili into a hockey game

01:42.349 --> 01:44.149
for the purposes of selling it,

01:44.249 --> 01:46.715
so if we could make a
custom-design body suit

01:46.815 --> 01:49.715
that could be filled with
a massive payload of chili,

01:49.815 --> 01:51.482
Robert would finally be able to sell

01:51.582 --> 01:53.949
his signature dish at Rabobank Arena

01:54.015 --> 01:58.082
without stadium management
ever catching on.

01:58.182 --> 02:00.282
That's interesting.

02:02.649 --> 02:06.149
I'm just curious as to how...
what it would look like.

02:06.249 --> 02:08.348
You know, I put a lot of
thought into this idea,

02:08.449 --> 02:11.215
and every time I run
it through in my head,

02:11.315 --> 02:12.715
it works perfectly.

02:12.815 --> 02:14.549
Okay.

02:14.649 --> 02:17.049
Robert was on board, so later that week,

02:17.149 --> 02:18.615
I hired a professional tailor

02:18.715 --> 02:20.682
to help design the chili suit

02:20.782 --> 02:23.249
based on a detailed sketch I had drawn.

02:23.349 --> 02:27.415
The easiest way is probably
to put the chili in...

02:27.515 --> 02:29.515
I guess from the neck part, right?

02:29.615 --> 02:31.282
Sure.

02:31.382 --> 02:33.349
Our plan was to have
the chili reservoirs

02:33.449 --> 02:36.415
mimic the distribution of
fat on a larger man's body

02:36.515 --> 02:38.949
so it wouldn't look
suspicious under clothing,

02:39.015 --> 02:40.949
and with the help of
a guy from Craigslist,

02:41.049 --> 02:44.042
our tailor was able to take
all the measurements he needed.

02:44.159 --> 02:46.615
- The chili is gonna go here.
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.715 --> 02:49.415
And we can get more in here too.

02:49.515 --> 02:51.049
You could probably do,
like, a cup there, right?

02:51.149 --> 02:52.549
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Cup or so?

02:52.649 --> 02:54.482
- Yeah, a cup, yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

02:54.582 --> 02:55.615
All right, so we'll
see you around, then.

02:55.715 --> 02:57.482
Yeah. Thank you so much.

02:57.582 --> 02:58.949
And a few days later, we received

02:58.982 --> 03:00.749
a completed prototype

03:00.849 --> 03:03.249
of a heat-resistant
polyvinyl fluoride suit

03:03.349 --> 03:05.782
designed to hold over 100 servings

03:05.949 --> 03:07.649
of fresh chili.

03:07.749 --> 03:09.549
The individual
reservoirs would be linked

03:09.649 --> 03:11.715
by a network of tubes
that would all lead

03:11.815 --> 03:13.982
to a battery-powered peristaltic pump

03:14.082 --> 03:15.949
for dispensing the chili.

03:15.982 --> 03:17.849
Using our intake funnel,

03:17.949 --> 03:21.282
we loaded in over 30
pounds of Robert's product

03:21.382 --> 03:23.182
that had been blended into a thin paste

03:23.282 --> 03:28.215
to ensure an even flow without
compromising the flavor.

03:28.315 --> 03:30.049
So with that, I activated the pump,

03:30.149 --> 03:32.715
and it was time to
see if this could work.

03:32.815 --> 03:35.515
[MOTOR WHIRRING]

03:36.749 --> 03:37.949
As I had hoped,

03:38.049 --> 03:39.015
the pump dispensed the chili

03:39.115 --> 03:40.182
at a steady pace,

03:40.282 --> 03:41.382
which was good,

03:41.482 --> 03:42.949
but I realized we had overlooked

03:42.982 --> 03:45.215
a crucial detail.

03:45.315 --> 03:47.315
The chili suit prevented
bathroom access,

03:47.415 --> 03:48.549
and because of its weight,

03:48.649 --> 03:49.982
removing it during a game

03:50.082 --> 03:51.549
would not be an option.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.349
So I experimented with a design

03:53.449 --> 03:55.515
that would allow me to
deposit my excretions

03:55.615 --> 03:58.049
directly into custom rubber underwear

03:58.149 --> 04:00.415
connected to a secondary pumping system

04:00.515 --> 04:02.415
so I could eject it into a toilet

04:02.515 --> 04:05.049
via a second tube down my right arm.

04:05.149 --> 04:07.215
But once I had some clothing on,

04:07.315 --> 04:09.482
I realized the potential
for a costly mix-up

04:09.582 --> 04:11.115
was too great.

04:11.215 --> 04:12.949
So I had the bottom part of the suit

04:12.982 --> 04:14.815
redesigned with strategic holes

04:14.949 --> 04:16.548
in the groin and buttocks region

04:16.649 --> 04:18.214
that would allow the wearer

04:18.315 --> 04:19.949
to relieve him or herself

04:20.048 --> 04:22.682
without taking off the suit.

04:22.782 --> 04:25.315
But there was still the
issue of the temperature.

04:25.415 --> 04:27.149
To meet health department standards,

04:27.249 --> 04:29.115
Robert said the chili
would have to remain

04:29.215 --> 04:33.615
above 135 degrees
Fahrenheit at all times.

04:33.715 --> 04:36.315
But when I put it on,
the heat was so intense

04:36.415 --> 04:38.315
that I could barely
have it against my skin

04:38.415 --> 04:40.315
for more than a few seconds.

04:40.415 --> 04:43.149
So I tracked down some
heat-resistant polymer gel

04:43.249 --> 04:44.815
that could insulate the body

04:44.949 --> 04:46.815
against the most extreme temperatures.

04:46.949 --> 04:47.949
Feel anything?

04:47.982 --> 04:49.149
- No.
- Good.

04:49.249 --> 04:50.949
I did a preliminary test

04:51.049 --> 04:53.482
with a blowtorch on
various parts of my body

04:53.582 --> 04:56.949
to ensure the gel would protect
even my most sensitive regions.

04:56.982 --> 04:59.449
[GROANING]

04:59.549 --> 05:01.849
And after getting gelled
up from head to toe,

05:01.949 --> 05:04.349
the burning sensation
had completely vanished.

05:04.449 --> 05:06.182
Yeah.

05:06.282 --> 05:08.382
It seemed like we had
solved every problem,

05:08.482 --> 05:12.015
but there was still one final
thing I had to take care of.

05:12.115 --> 05:14.815
The pump on my chest that
made the chili suit function

05:14.949 --> 05:16.249
was made out of metal,

05:16.349 --> 05:18.782
and to get into Rabobank Arena,

05:18.949 --> 05:21.615
every ticket holder has to
pass through a metal detector.

05:21.715 --> 05:23.815
So I figured if I
could convince security

05:23.949 --> 05:27.249
that I had a medically
necessary pacemaker,

05:27.349 --> 05:29.615
they wouldn't be suspicious
when the alarm went off.

05:29.715 --> 05:32.249
So I taped a real pacemaker to my chest

05:32.349 --> 05:33.949
and then headed to a walk-in clinic

05:33.982 --> 05:35.649
to request an X-ray

05:35.749 --> 05:37.582
that would hopefully trick the physician

05:37.682 --> 05:39.249
into writing me a doctor's note.

05:39.349 --> 05:41.615
I would need to actually examine you

05:41.715 --> 05:45.015
and see why is it that
you need the X-ray.

05:45.115 --> 05:47.215
I have to have a reason why.

05:47.315 --> 05:49.449
Well, I'm paying you for it,

05:49.549 --> 05:51.249
so what do you care?

05:52.715 --> 05:57.449
- I'm actually...
- legally, it's being...

05:57.549 --> 06:00.682
monitored to see why
we're ordering an X-ray.

06:00.782 --> 06:02.182
Oh.

06:02.282 --> 06:03.515
Well, what's the minimum I need to say

06:03.615 --> 06:04.649
to get one?

06:07.415 --> 06:10.615
Either some area hurts
of your chest or...

06:10.715 --> 06:12.149
- Sure.
- You're having a cough.

06:12.249 --> 06:14.049
Okay. Yeah.

06:14.149 --> 06:16.349
- Are you...
- what are you experiencing?

06:16.449 --> 06:19.149
Yeah, both those. Yeah.

06:19.249 --> 06:20.415
Mm-kay.

06:20.515 --> 06:22.215
Just step as close as you can,

06:22.315 --> 06:24.182
and you're gonna take
this shirt off, okay?

06:24.346 --> 06:28.322
_

06:29.315 --> 06:30.949
Your undershirt will be fine,

06:30.982 --> 06:31.949
but I gotta get rid
of the buttons, okay?

06:32.049 --> 06:33.149
Okay. Okay, sure.

06:33.249 --> 06:35.149
Take a big breath.

06:35.249 --> 06:36.749
Hold it.

06:36.849 --> 06:38.049
And once the doctor saw

06:38.149 --> 06:39.749
the pacemaker on my X-ray...

06:39.849 --> 06:40.949
It looks like it's in well position

06:41.049 --> 06:44.082
and no abnormalities.

06:44.182 --> 06:45.715
She wrote me a doctor's
note that would hopefully

06:45.815 --> 06:47.249
get me through security.

06:47.349 --> 06:49.249
Thank you so much, Doctor.

06:49.349 --> 06:51.749
And that meant it was
finally time to buy a ticket

06:51.849 --> 06:54.314
to the next Bakersfield
Condors home game.

06:54.479 --> 06:56.479
So an hour before puck drop,

06:56.613 --> 06:58.946
I headed to the Lie-N-Den
to fill up the suit

06:59.046 --> 07:01.213
with a fresh batch of chili.

07:01.313 --> 07:03.479
I then put on some extra large clothing

07:03.613 --> 07:05.479
that made me look like
a typical hockey fan

07:05.613 --> 07:07.446
but was also secretly designed

07:07.613 --> 07:09.513
so I could carry everything I would need

07:09.613 --> 07:10.813
for our customers.

07:10.913 --> 07:12.146
Along with a special pocket

07:12.246 --> 07:14.246
built to hold cups and spoons,

07:14.346 --> 07:16.679
I also had a cane with a secret trigger

07:16.779 --> 07:19.379
that could dispense organic
sour cream on demand,

07:19.479 --> 07:22.179
a trucker hat with a
built-in cheese grater

07:22.279 --> 07:24.146
to deliver fresh cheddar cheese,

07:24.246 --> 07:28.013
and lastly, a cargo
pocket full of chives.

07:33.646 --> 07:35.179
Got a little bit of an aftertaste,

07:35.279 --> 07:37.379
but I don't know if it's the chives

07:37.479 --> 07:39.079
or the sour cream.

07:42.279 --> 07:43.479
It's close.

07:43.613 --> 07:44.913
With everything set

07:45.013 --> 07:46.246
and just minutes until game time,

07:46.346 --> 07:48.279
I arrived at Rabobank Arena

07:48.379 --> 07:51.079
and nervously approached
the security checkpoint.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.179
Hi. I have a medical condition.

07:53.279 --> 07:55.379
This is my pacemaker ID card.

08:09.413 --> 08:10.946
Thank you so much.

08:11.046 --> 08:13.979
Getting inside was a huge victory,

08:15.713 --> 08:17.313
to sell chili for an entire game

08:17.413 --> 08:19.146
without getting caught,

08:19.246 --> 08:21.046
so I decided to start
in the upper levels

08:21.146 --> 08:22.613
where security was thinner.

08:22.646 --> 08:24.979

but it wasn't long until
I had my first sale.

08:34.946 --> 08:37.313
It's chili.

08:37.413 --> 08:39.313
- Do you want one?
- _

08:39.413 --> 08:41.212
As my confidence grew,

08:41.313 --> 08:42.679
I ventured down to the lower level,

08:42.779 --> 08:44.179
where I got a second sale

08:44.279 --> 08:46.679
from a guy in section 109.

08:46.779 --> 08:49.679
I used my big body to
block the view of security

08:49.779 --> 08:52.213

08:52.313 --> 08:55.513
Here you go. Two dollars, please.

08:55.613 --> 08:57.746
And after that, I began
to feel invincible.

08:57.846 --> 08:59.646
Hi, there.

08:59.746 --> 09:02.146
I moved through the
stadium like a ninja,

09:02.246 --> 09:04.379
switching sections after each sale

09:04.479 --> 09:05.713
so I couldn't be tracked.

At one point,

09:07.379 --> 09:08.613
I thought security was on my tail,

09:08.713 --> 09:10.446
but I was able to lose the guy

09:10.613 --> 09:12.646
by ducking into a handicapped bathroom,

09:12.746 --> 09:14.013
after which I reemerged

09:14.113 --> 09:15.479
and resumed my operation.

09:15.613 --> 09:16.979
I can serve it to you right now.

09:17.079 --> 09:19.079
I have it right under my clothes.

09:19.179 --> 09:22.279
I sold 16 bowls of
delicious chili that night,

09:22.379 --> 09:25.013
right under the noses
of stadium management,

09:25.113 --> 09:27.213
and that meant, from this day forward,

09:27.313 --> 09:30.013
Robert had a proven
method to sell his chili

09:30.113 --> 09:31.413
at Rabobank Arena.

09:31.513 --> 09:34.446
This is $32.

09:34.613 --> 09:36.679
And the ticket was only 12.

09:36.779 --> 09:39.779
So that's $20 profit in one game.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.446
Okay.

09:41.613 --> 09:42.813
So I'll just leave all
this here for you, then?

09:42.913 --> 09:43.946
Yeah.

09:45.313 --> 09:47.346
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

09:53.646 --> 09:55.913
Nothing feels better than a massage.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.613
Nothing.

09:57.646 --> 09:59.913
Which is why Anna Davis of Swan Day Spa

10:00.013 --> 10:01.746
in Los Angeles, California,

10:01.846 --> 10:03.746
has made it her livelihood.

10:03.846 --> 10:05.713
But with plenty of
competition in the area,

10:05.813 --> 10:08.346
Anna has been forced to
lower her prices so much,

10:08.446 --> 10:09.979
she's barely making a profit.

10:10.079 --> 10:11.713
Now we have a lot of competition,

10:11.813 --> 10:13.713
so the client, when they got in,

10:13.813 --> 10:15.979
they were looking for the cheaper price.

10:16.079 --> 10:19.446
We have a deep tissue one,
which is, you pay more, $15.

10:19.546 --> 10:20.913
I think I'll try the
$40 one for right now.

10:21.013 --> 10:23.113
Okay. Okay, that's fine.

10:23.213 --> 10:25.113
With customers going
for the cheapest price

10:25.213 --> 10:27.846
and ignoring her more
profitable premium massages,

10:27.946 --> 10:29.646
it was clearly a problem.

10:29.746 --> 10:31.913
So I paid Anna a visit with a unique way

10:32.013 --> 10:33.879
for her to upsell her customers.

10:33.979 --> 10:35.913
You see, the key to upselling

10:36.013 --> 10:38.713
is advertising a low
price to bring people in

10:38.813 --> 10:41.413
but then ensuring that
once they see the product,

10:41.513 --> 10:43.413
they'll definitely want to upgrade.

10:43.513 --> 10:45.779
So if customers arrived at Swan Day Spa

10:45.879 --> 10:47.779
and discovered that the $40 special

10:47.879 --> 10:51.113
was done exclusively by someone
with a contagious disease,

10:51.213 --> 10:52.813
like viral warts,

10:52.913 --> 10:54.613
customers would be a lot more likely

10:54.713 --> 10:57.546
to upgrade to one of
Anna's premium options.

10:57.646 --> 10:59.413
THE PLAN: upsell customers

10:59.613 --> 11:03.446
by making the $40
special a wart massage.

11:04.779 --> 11:07.779
I think... I think you're right.

11:07.879 --> 11:11.146
Nobody want to get the wart massage.

11:11.246 --> 11:12.313
For sure.

11:12.413 --> 11:13.613
Anna was intrigued,

11:13.646 --> 11:15.179
but she was a bit worried

11:15.279 --> 11:17.846
about what her customers might think.

11:17.946 --> 11:19.679
They might be upset.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.246
They might be sue me.

11:21.346 --> 11:23.313
Sue the business.

11:23.413 --> 11:25.113
But I assured her that
no one would complain

11:25.213 --> 11:27.646
as long as they believed
it was for a good cause.

11:27.746 --> 11:29.379
Have you ever done any
charity work before?

11:29.479 --> 11:31.613
- Oh, never.
- So with Anna's blessing,

11:31.679 --> 11:33.513
I created a real charity

11:33.613 --> 11:35.879
whose mission was to place
people living with warts

11:35.979 --> 11:37.213
into the workplace.

11:37.313 --> 11:39.346
I then distributed our flyers

11:39.446 --> 11:41.746
at dermatology clinics across the city

11:41.846 --> 11:43.613
and posted an ad on Craigslist

11:43.646 --> 11:45.913
seeking people with active viral warts

11:46.013 --> 11:48.413
who were looking for
work, and later that week,

11:48.513 --> 11:50.913
I met with the two men who responded.

11:51.013 --> 11:53.746
I think I've had every
kind of wart invented.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.379
[LAUGHS] I don't know.

11:55.479 --> 11:57.279
Oh, whoa.

11:57.379 --> 12:00.613
But probably the worst
case of warts that I had

12:00.713 --> 12:03.646
was on my penis.

12:03.746 --> 12:05.346
Okay.

12:05.446 --> 12:06.346
And it was, like, a circle around my...

12:06.446 --> 12:08.479
I mean, it was...

12:10.279 --> 12:15.246
Made it so that...
sex was not an option.

12:15.346 --> 12:16.479
- Right.
- Right?

12:16.613 --> 12:17.979
- Yeah, 'cause...
- Yeah.

12:18.079 --> 12:19.179
I just took a soldering iron.

12:19.279 --> 12:20.679
Burned it off myself.

12:20.779 --> 12:22.279
- Whoa.
- Like, why go to a doctor

12:22.379 --> 12:23.379
and have him do it?

12:23.479 --> 12:24.446
I know what he's doing.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.279
Just burned it off.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.346
- You drop something?
- I did, yeah.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.813
A little device here.

12:28.913 --> 12:30.813
- A device?
- Yes.

12:32.946 --> 12:38.113
- What is that?
- This is a wellness wand.

12:39.279 --> 12:40.613
- What's that mean?
- Well, it's...

12:40.679 --> 12:42.046
Right now,

12:42.146 --> 12:43.879
the way that the unit works

12:43.979 --> 12:46.046
if I have it sitting right...

12:46.146 --> 12:47.879
if I set it right here,

12:47.979 --> 12:49.679
it's putting out a signal

12:49.779 --> 12:51.446
that's coming out to
the edge of the table,

12:51.613 --> 12:52.879
maybe a little beyond.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.113
- Uh-huh.
- All right?

12:54.213 --> 12:56.646
And the signal is matching

12:56.746 --> 13:00.513
with whatever the needs are
that you select from the files.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.379
- Are you a healer or something?
- Yes.

13:02.479 --> 13:03.379
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:03.479 --> 13:04.446
Okay.

13:04.613 --> 13:05.479
- Yeah.
- What...

13:05.613 --> 13:06.513
Uh, what...

13:06.613 --> 13:08.613
How, um...

13:08.713 --> 13:09.746
Okay.

13:11.146 --> 13:12.779
After carefully vetting the candidates

13:12.879 --> 13:15.079
to be sure they had at least one wart,

13:15.179 --> 13:18.979
I officially signed them
on to the CityWarts roster.

13:19.079 --> 13:21.513
But before they could be
placed at Swan Day Spa,

13:21.613 --> 13:23.946
there was still one
thing our charity needed:

13:24.046 --> 13:25.713
an endorsement.

13:25.813 --> 13:27.513
It seemed like every credible charity

13:27.613 --> 13:29.313
had the endorsement of a public figure,

13:29.413 --> 13:31.746
like a mayor or a city council member,

13:31.846 --> 13:34.113
and I was worried that if
CityWarts didn't have one,

13:34.213 --> 13:36.313
the public would never accept the idea

13:36.413 --> 13:38.746
of a wart-infected masseur.

13:38.846 --> 13:43.046
So I rented out the ballroom of
the historic Oxford Palace Hotel

13:43.146 --> 13:46.146
and then reached out to every
local politician I could find,

13:46.246 --> 13:48.246
inviting them to be the guest of honor

13:48.346 --> 13:51.113
at a gala event for the
launch of a new charity.

13:51.213 --> 13:53.879
And after a few days,
we finally got an RSVP

13:53.979 --> 13:55.813
from Councilman Ed Reyes,

13:55.913 --> 13:59.013
a 12-year veteran of LA's city council.

13:59.113 --> 14:00.313
So on the day of the event,

14:00.413 --> 14:01.946
I decorated the ballroom

14:02.046 --> 14:03.746
with the finest and fanciest things

14:03.846 --> 14:05.846
in the hopes that this
gala would be enough

14:05.946 --> 14:08.779
to dazzle Councilman Reyes
into legitimizing CityWarts

14:08.879 --> 14:10.913
with his official endorsement.

14:11.013 --> 14:12.279
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hey.

14:12.379 --> 14:13.613
Oh, my gosh. You look nice.

14:13.713 --> 14:15.246
- Thank you.
- How are you?

14:15.346 --> 14:17.246
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

14:17.346 --> 14:18.746
Okay, so.

14:18.846 --> 14:19.879
What do you think?

14:19.979 --> 14:21.646
- I like it.
- It's pretty.

14:21.746 --> 14:22.879
Once Anna took her seat,

14:22.979 --> 14:24.246
we opened our doors

14:24.346 --> 14:25.646
to the crowd of random people

14:25.746 --> 14:27.446
I had paid to attend the event

14:27.613 --> 14:29.179
so that Councilman
Reyes would be impressed

14:29.279 --> 14:31.079
by the charity's popularity

14:31.179 --> 14:32.779
when he arrived.

14:32.879 --> 14:34.079
Since every real charity gala

14:34.179 --> 14:36.046
is hosted by a beauty queen,

14:36.146 --> 14:39.079
I hired Miss California
2013, Mabelynn Capeluj,

14:39.179 --> 14:41.046
to be the evening's host.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.713
It's here in Los Angeles, and they help

14:42.813 --> 14:45.713
people in Los Angeles
with warts get jobs?

14:45.813 --> 14:47.846
- Yes.
- That's their mission, okay.

14:47.946 --> 14:50.146
Do you get nervous before
these things at all?

14:50.246 --> 14:51.813
- Um, sometimes, sometimes.
- Yeah?

14:51.913 --> 14:54.179
But I feel like this will be easy.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.908
Hopefully I don't jinx myself.

14:55.930 --> 14:56.848
- You're so beautiful...
- Thank you.

14:56.923 --> 14:58.057
You could probably go out there

14:58.095 --> 14:59.628
and just go, "Blah, blah, blah,"

14:59.666 --> 15:01.459
and no one would know the difference.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.567
- Thank you. Hopefully.
- Yeah. No problem.

15:08.330 --> 15:09.663
As the crowd settled in,

15:09.763 --> 15:11.563
Councilman Reyes entered the room

15:11.663 --> 15:12.830
with all the confidence
I would have expected

15:12.930 --> 15:14.496
from an elected official.

15:14.596 --> 15:16.930
I only hoped that this gala event

15:17.030 --> 15:19.330
would be enough to win
his coveted endorsement.

15:19.396 --> 15:22.430
[APPLAUSE]

15:30.883 --> 15:33.550
So, growing up, I actually
had a friend who...

15:33.650 --> 15:35.350
he had warts on his hand,

15:35.450 --> 15:38.350
and I believe his mom or he said

15:38.450 --> 15:40.150
it was from handling a frog.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.150
He was able to seek medical attention,

15:43.250 --> 15:46.350
and they were able to
freeze and remove the wart,

15:46.450 --> 15:48.350
and he's just fine now,

15:48.450 --> 15:50.983
and that's why I'm so
proud to introduce to you

15:51.083 --> 15:54.550
CityWarts and their mission
to put warts to work.

15:54.650 --> 15:55.816
And right now, I'd like to bring out

15:55.916 --> 15:57.450
some CityWarts Angels

15:57.550 --> 15:59.816
to talk about their own
experiences with warts.

15:59.916 --> 16:01.883
[APPLAUSE]

16:01.983 --> 16:03.716
[CLASSICAL MUSIC]

16:03.816 --> 16:05.416
My name is Daniel,

16:05.516 --> 16:08.550
and I have warts.

16:10.777 --> 16:12.444
My hope is that some personal stories

16:12.544 --> 16:14.377
from our CityWarts Angels would help

16:14.477 --> 16:16.577
garner sympathy from Councilman Reyes.

16:16.744 --> 16:18.777
I had a wart right here.

16:18.877 --> 16:22.177
Nine warts made, like,
a number six on my hand.

16:22.277 --> 16:26.977
A ring of genital warts around my penis.

16:27.077 --> 16:28.810
Remember, wart pride.

16:28.910 --> 16:29.977
Thanks, CityWarts.

16:30.077 --> 16:31.410
Thank you very much.

16:31.510 --> 16:33.610
[APPLAUSE]

16:33.744 --> 16:37.777
I appreciate everything
that CityWarts is doing

16:37.877 --> 16:40.177
for our community,

16:40.277 --> 16:42.610
and because of CityWarts,

16:42.744 --> 16:47.744
I had a opportunity for a
job placement with massage.

16:47.810 --> 16:49.910
You guys have a great night,

16:50.010 --> 16:51.577
and thank you.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.377
The speeches were a hit,

16:53.477 --> 16:55.044
and after concluding the night

16:55.144 --> 16:56.644
by recognizing the Swan Day Spa

16:56.744 --> 16:58.777
as CityWarts' newest partner,

16:58.877 --> 17:00.844
it was time to approach Councilman Reyes

17:00.944 --> 17:02.044
for his endorsement.

17:02.144 --> 17:03.544
Councilman, hi.

17:03.644 --> 17:04.844
Would I be able to get a photo with you

17:04.944 --> 17:06.144
and Anna over here?

17:06.243 --> 17:08.010
This is Anna.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.176
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Hi, Anna.

17:09.277 --> 17:10.310
Okay, come on over here.

17:10.410 --> 17:11.544
With a photo of Anna

17:11.644 --> 17:12.844
standing next to

17:12.944 --> 17:14.176
a respected city councilman,

17:14.277 --> 17:16.109
it was now impossible to deny

17:16.210 --> 17:18.210
that he was a supporter of our cause.

17:18.310 --> 17:19.743
Thank you for that endorsement.

17:19.810 --> 17:20.910
Thank you so much.

17:21.010 --> 17:22.544
So with proof of our credibility

17:22.644 --> 17:23.743
now proudly displayed

17:23.844 --> 17:25.877
behind the desk at Swan Day Spa,

17:25.977 --> 17:27.644
it was finally time for our wart angels

17:27.743 --> 17:29.244
to meet their new boss.

17:29.344 --> 17:31.544
It is such a honor

17:31.644 --> 17:33.310
to be in a location

17:33.410 --> 17:35.744
where...

17:35.844 --> 17:38.510
you're creating a
wart-positive environment.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.544
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.644
[CHUCKLES]

17:42.744 --> 17:44.910
But before moving forward,
Anna wanted to be sure

17:45.010 --> 17:46.744
they had the right skills for the job.

17:46.844 --> 17:49.544
Have you ever trained to massage before?

17:49.644 --> 17:52.177
Are you a licensed massage therapist?

17:52.277 --> 17:55.110
I'm not a licensed massage therapist,

17:55.210 --> 17:58.310
but I stay in practice
with my girlfriend,

17:58.410 --> 18:00.977
because she gets foot reflexology

18:01.077 --> 18:02.810
every single night,

18:02.910 --> 18:05.377
and then I just work my
way up from the ankles.

18:05.477 --> 18:07.310
Apply. Release. Apply. Release.

18:07.410 --> 18:08.577
Dig a little bit.

18:08.744 --> 18:11.344
- Okay.
- Every night.

18:11.444 --> 18:12.977
She's a lucky lady.

18:13.077 --> 18:15.210
Oh, that's nice. How about you, Albert?

18:15.310 --> 18:17.244
Well, I've had experience.

18:17.344 --> 18:20.977
I used to give massages
to my grandmother.

18:21.077 --> 18:24.444
- Okay.
- Just a little bit at a time.

18:24.544 --> 18:26.877
Like, and I... the main focus

18:26.977 --> 18:29.444
was for her to feel good

18:29.544 --> 18:32.244
and not for me to be...

18:32.344 --> 18:35.444
because a massage is
not supposed to be...

18:35.544 --> 18:38.044
it's supposed to be...

18:38.144 --> 18:39.844
- You know.
- Yeah.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.577
Just making the person relax and...

18:42.744 --> 18:46.044
Okay, so you approve
them? They meet your standards?

18:46.144 --> 18:47.977
For right now, I mean,
we have to learn more.

18:48.077 --> 18:50.977
For now, yeah, we have to see.

18:51.594 --> 18:54.034
Anna was satisfied with
their qualifications,

18:54.105 --> 18:55.805
so the Angels took their stations

18:55.905 --> 18:57.572
while Anna and I waited
for customers up front.

18:57.672 --> 18:59.372
Yes, I'd like to have the massage.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.872
Yeah, it's... how you like it?

19:01.972 --> 19:03.705
We have so many kinds.

19:03.805 --> 19:06.338
I want to get that one that
was the special for $40.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.838
- Okay.
- As usual, the customer chose

19:08.938 --> 19:10.905
the cheapest option available,

19:11.005 --> 19:13.038
so once she was ready
and waiting on the table,

19:13.138 --> 19:16.014
it was time to see if
the new upsell would work.

19:16.107 --> 19:17.507
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

19:17.576 --> 19:20.342
Hi, so I'm not sure if you're aware,

19:20.426 --> 19:22.893
but the $40 massage
special that you selected

19:22.927 --> 19:26.393
is done in conjunction with
a charity outreach program

19:26.439 --> 19:28.306
- called CityWarts...
- Uh-huh.

19:28.381 --> 19:30.414
That puts people living with
warts into the workplace.

19:30.514 --> 19:32.014
Okay.

19:32.114 --> 19:33.848
Is that something
you're comfortable with?

19:33.881 --> 19:36.014
Yeah, that's okay 'cause
it's not a contagious thing.

19:36.114 --> 19:37.281
Oh, actually, warts are contagious.

19:37.381 --> 19:39.114
- Oh, they are?
- Yes.

19:39.214 --> 19:42.348
- Oh. They're contagious?
- Yes.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.981
Does he wear gloves or what?

19:44.081 --> 19:46.281
He will be wearing thin gloves.

19:46.381 --> 19:49.348
After telling the client about
our full range of massages,

19:49.448 --> 19:52.181
she could now see the benefits
of the premium options.

19:52.281 --> 19:53.748
So how much are the other massages?

19:53.848 --> 19:55.548
It's just $15 more.

19:55.648 --> 19:57.148
All right, I'll take one of the others.

19:57.248 --> 19:59.281
My plan worked perfectly.

19:59.381 --> 20:01.848
All right, so this is
your therapist, Mamie.

20:01.948 --> 20:03.948
She does not have any warts.

20:04.048 --> 20:05.148
- All right, thanks.
- At all.

20:05.248 --> 20:06.681
Okay, great, enjoy your massage.

20:06.781 --> 20:08.348
- Thank you.
- And Anna was thrilled.

20:08.448 --> 20:09.948
- She upgraded.
- Oh!

20:10.048 --> 20:11.048
And as the day went on,

20:11.148 --> 20:12.881
more and more customers

20:12.981 --> 20:14.714
opted to upgrade to the premium options.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.814
I guess I just want the one
with the non-wart worker.

20:17.914 --> 20:19.148
Yeah.

20:19.248 --> 20:21.014
Anna was upselling her clients

20:21.114 --> 20:22.981
at an unprecedented rate,

20:23.081 --> 20:24.848
and any time a customer was skeptical,

20:24.948 --> 20:26.681
we had all the credibility we needed.

20:26.781 --> 20:28.881
This is me and a city councilor.

20:28.981 --> 20:31.748
I mean, I don't know how much more legit

20:31.848 --> 20:33.981
you can get than an LA city councilman

20:34.081 --> 20:37.414
endorsing the charity, but...

20:37.514 --> 20:40.748
- Yeah, it seemingly...
- it seems safe

20:40.848 --> 20:43.348
if the city's working with it.

20:43.448 --> 20:45.114
I did feel a little bad

20:45.214 --> 20:46.448
that no one wanted anything to do

20:46.548 --> 20:48.348
with our wart angels that day,

20:48.448 --> 20:50.014
but it was nice to know

20:50.114 --> 20:51.814
that at least they had each other.

20:51.914 --> 20:54.614
I love baking cakes.

20:54.714 --> 20:57.048
Pies.

20:57.148 --> 21:00.114
Is it the baking that you like,

21:00.214 --> 21:03.114
or is it the look in the person's eyes

21:03.214 --> 21:06.114
that you baked it for?

21:06.214 --> 21:07.114
Both.

21:07.214 --> 21:09.848
Absolutely.

21:12.677 --> 21:14.711
Type of pacemaker you have?

21:15.748 --> 21:18.048
Um...

21:18.148 --> 21:20.414
I think it's a...

21:22.381 --> 21:24.414
Sony?

21:24.480 --> 21:27.284
