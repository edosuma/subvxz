-The internet.

The AIDS crisis, it wiped out nearly every
meaningful critical voice in every medium.

So now, the artist's intention
is buried in a sea of likes and thumbs up.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.824
but, hey, damn, I got this.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.158
-[Nadia] Mm-hmm.
-[Ruth] Uh-huh.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.619
Look, she's smoking, like you. Get it?

11:43.703 --> 11:46.163
And St. Valentine was a big smoker.
Everybody knows that.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.331
Oh, yeah.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.167
Fucking bingo.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.713
It's here.

11:53.796 --> 11:57.174
You know, that was written by the same
woman that wrote <i>Anne of Green Gables.</i>

11:57.258 --> 11:58.217
[Nadia] Yeah, of course.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.636
Everybody loves Anne,

12:00.720 --> 12:03.431
but I like Emily.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.432
She's dark.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.394
-You lock the door behind you?
-Yes.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.438
You already asked me that, Ruthie.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.190
Oh, I know. My memory's slipping.

12:13.274 --> 12:17.153
There's-- There's somebody
in the neighborhood.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.781
I am making you tea.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.409
But, personally,
I wouldn't touch the stuff.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.244
[Nadia] "She despised Rhoda...

12:25.661 --> 12:28.038
more than ever
for trying to get back with her."

12:28.622 --> 12:31.250
You know, Rhoda was the cunt
in this story, obviously.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.501
Here we are.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.174
[knock at door]

12:40.217 --> 12:41.719
[sighs]

12:41.802 --> 12:43.721
Fucking God damn it, man.

12:45.639 --> 12:46.640
[sighs]

12:47.183 --> 12:48.684
[knocking on door]

12:49.185 --> 12:50.853
[knocking continues rapidly]

12:51.353 --> 12:52.188
[sighs]

12:52.897 --> 12:54.190
[dance music playing]

12:56.650 --> 12:58.444
-Gas explosion.
-[Alan] Bike accident.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.404
Listen, I know you think
I'm a moral narcissist,

13:00.488 --> 13:02.406
but there are good guys and bad guys.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.366
And I am definitely a good guy.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.994
And that piece of shit, he...

13:07.953 --> 13:09.288
he is a bad guy.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.958
Okay, so then why are you
the one in purgatory?

13:14.251 --> 13:16.462
Hey, happy birthday.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.630
John.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.548
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

13:19.632 --> 13:21.801
So, listen. Uh, remember
when I stood up Lucy

13:21.884 --> 13:23.761
and you've been secretly
resenting me ever since?

13:23.844 --> 13:25.971
Let's take her to breakfast
tomorrow morning,

13:26.055 --> 13:28.390
make everything kosher copacetic, okay?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.310
We can go to my place.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.813
Let's take the fire escape.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.357
It'll be fun.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.317
[gasps] What's that?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.735
-Come on.
-Whoa.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.030
[Mike] You gotta stop getting
so worked up over him.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.324
You've spent enough time
on this guy already.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.701
I know it's a bummer, but come on.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.786
Oh, yeah.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.913
Yeah, it is a bummer.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.790
It is a bummer for everybody involved,

13:52.873 --> 13:54.250
except, it seems, to be for you,

13:54.333 --> 13:56.001
which, you know, doesn't make any sense,

13:56.085 --> 13:59.088
because if anybody deserves to be punished

13:59.171 --> 14:01.340
for the rest of their fucking life,
it is you.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.133
You are fucking garbage,

14:03.217 --> 14:05.010
and someone needs to bag you up,

14:05.094 --> 14:07.555
take you outside,
throw you into the East River,

14:07.638 --> 14:10.432
and put everyone
who can smell your fucking stench

14:10.516 --> 14:12.309
out of their goddamn misery!

14:12.393 --> 14:13.227
God!

14:13.310 --> 14:14.770
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.856
-Yeah!
-Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

14:17.356 --> 14:20.192
I don't know who the fuck you are,
I don't know what's going on here,

14:20.276 --> 14:23.237
but either you two suck each other's dicks
or get out of my apartment.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.823
Okay? Come on.
I'm not sucking anybody's dick.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.664
Bea, he's a sex addict.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.542
-[Beatrice] <i>Who?</i>
-Michael. Mike. Your Mike. Your Michael.

14:36.625 --> 14:40.212
Alan, you're so fucking drunk right now.
I'm not gonna do this with you.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.090
-I am not, okay?
-[Alan] <i>Bea, he's a sex addict.</i>

14:43.173 --> 14:45.759
Don't bother calling me back,
'cause you're not gonna be sober.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.136
-You need help.
-Please, Bea.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.804
-[honking]
-[tires screech]

14:48.888 --> 14:50.097
-[crash]
-[water running]

14:56.896 --> 14:58.063
[water running]

15:02.318 --> 15:04.320
-Gas explosion again.
-Again?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.113
I get hit by a car.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.406
[Nadia] Oh, classic.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.449
Hey, wait a second.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.160
Are you telling me
that you're never dying on the stairs?

15:11.243 --> 15:12.494
No.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.539
Are you some kind
of a fucking superhero or just a...

15:15.623 --> 15:17.583
Do you think that we're dying
at the same time?

15:17.666 --> 15:19.668
Hey, happy birthday.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.629
Give me one second.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.423
[snoring]

15:25.132 --> 15:26.926
[horns honking in the distance]

15:34.892 --> 15:38.103
-Up with Susan?
-Yeah, 'cause she was like doing that.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.981
-What?
-She was choking her during sex.

15:41.065 --> 15:41.899
Oh!

15:41.982 --> 15:44.026
Yeah, she's a choker and shit.

15:44.109 --> 15:44.985
Yeah.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.654
It's kind of hot.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.281
I mean, it is kind of hot,
but then the stalking started.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.950
-That's not hot.
-Yeah.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.246
This guy's been following us
for like five blocks.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.501
What the hell are you even--

16:00.584 --> 16:02.211
Back the fuck up, motherfucker!

16:02.294 --> 16:06.966
I said back the fuck up, motherfucker!
Back the fuck up, motherfucker! Back up!

16:07.049 --> 16:08.676
Let's go! Let's go!

16:16.392 --> 16:17.810
[keys jangling]

16:19.478 --> 16:21.355
Three-one-one, you guys rock.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.316
Listen, uh, I'd like to report a gas leak.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.568
Yeah.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.278
Yes, it is urgent.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.530
Uh-huh.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.282
You know, it's a big-time
fucking emergency, actually.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.044
[gunshot]

16:51.427 --> 16:52.678
[shaky breathing]

16:54.680 --> 16:55.681
[Ruth] Nadia!

16:56.724 --> 16:58.851
Oh, God. Look at me. Look at--

16:58.934 --> 17:01.145
Oh! Nadia, no! Honey, please!

17:01.228 --> 17:03.772
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.399
I thought it was a burglar.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.944
They've been saying
there's somebody in the neighborhood.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.904
[speaking indistinctly]

17:14.533 --> 17:15.367
[knock at door]

17:17.494 --> 17:18.495
[Nadia] Fuck.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.082
Oh, fuck.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.460
[exhales]

17:25.961 --> 17:27.171
[exhales] Fuck.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.553
[exhales]

17:44.104 --> 17:45.439
[dance music playing]

17:47.941 --> 17:50.527
[Mike chuckles]

17:50.611 --> 17:52.446
[Mike] You think he's gonna propose?

17:53.113 --> 17:54.239
That's a bummer.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.618
Yeah.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.370
That's right.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.955
Hi. I'm Alan.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.959
-Yeah, I'm on the phone.
-Yeah, with my girlfriend.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.419
Beatrice.

18:08.295 --> 18:11.298
Bea, uh...
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna call you back.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.760
-Listen.
-Why you?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.637
Why me what?

18:16.720 --> 18:17.554
Bea.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.100
She chose you, and you don't love her.
You're not faithful.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.976
You never get punished.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.269
So why you?

18:25.729 --> 18:27.731
She didn't choose me, Alan.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.860
The only choice she made was not you.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.321
Nobody chooses me.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.367
I'm the hole where a choice should be.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.207
Oh, God. Alan.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.084
I had a mace-induced asthma attack. You?

18:47.167 --> 18:50.087
What if they keep going?

18:50.504 --> 18:53.006
-Who? Who keeps going?
-Them.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.467
I mean, everyone who's not us.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.178
All right, I thought
that what was happening to us

18:58.262 --> 19:00.013
wasn't hurting anybody else, but...

19:00.556 --> 19:03.267
[chuckles]
...I mean, they're all in it, too.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.309
What?

19:04.393 --> 19:07.396
Fifteen times, Ruth has grieved for me.

19:07.479 --> 19:11.608
In 15 universes, she's alone.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.403
Wait. It's 15 for you, too? Did you count?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.155
I know how to count, Alan.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.407
Hey, happy birthday.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.576
Hey. Okay, listen to me.

19:20.659 --> 19:24.496
We are leaving,
and I am not going to get the book.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.625
I'm going to tell your daughter
about <i>Emily of New Moon.</i>

19:29.459 --> 19:30.586
-Understand?
-Yeah.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.004
-Can you help me with this?
-Sure.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.463
Sorry, I gotta make a call.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.550
[woman laughs]

19:36.633 --> 19:39.219
-What the fuck?
-Oh, my God.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.556
You want me to feel guilty?

19:43.140 --> 19:44.057
Well, I don't.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.227
I am not Beatrice's boyfriend.
That was your job.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.605
Look, I know it's not up to me
to punish you.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.024
But I don't have to make this
easy for you.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.067
Who is Beatrice?
You know what? I don't care.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.571
Listen, I have an early flight
to Sweden in the morning,

19:57.654 --> 19:59.781
so you need to get out
so I can get it in.

20:01.033 --> 20:01.909
Whatever.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.454
If it wasn't you,
it would be some other woman.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.997
Do I look like I care?

20:07.080 --> 20:09.750
-I-- I wasn't trying to insult you, ma'am.
-Fuck you.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.211
[sighs]

20:14.046 --> 20:16.298
She told me all about you, you know?

20:16.840 --> 20:20.677
That you have mental problems,
that you're sick and you won't get help,

20:20.761 --> 20:22.179
and she couldn't break up with you

20:22.262 --> 20:24.264
because she was afraid
you would do something.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.974
She calls you the gingerbread man.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.894
She can call me whatever she wants.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.066
[sighs]

21:02.469 --> 21:03.720
I'll be right back, okay?

21:10.310 --> 21:11.228
[John] There she is.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.021
[Nadia] John, man.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.530
This kid just gave me the finger.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.739
[John laughs]

21:22.823 --> 21:24.032
She's perfect.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.202
Luce, say hi.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.330
Say hi, baby. Say hi.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.082
Pancake time.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.792
Okay, John.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.004
-Be careful.
-With what?

21:39.464 --> 21:40.382
What's wrong?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.719
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.887
-Do what?
-I can't meet her.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.306
I could die in front of her, John.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.223
-Die?
-Yes.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.726
-What are you gonna die from?
-I don't know. The grate.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.521
A car could run me over.
I mean, best case scenario, I...

21:55.439 --> 21:57.065
[sighs] ...disappear.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.652
Don't do this.
Okay, please, I'm begging you.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.695
Don't do this to her.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.072
I can't have people
coming in and out of her life like this.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.950
Exactly, all right? I'm not rejecting her.
I'm protecting her.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.120
[John] Don't do this to her, please. Okay?
Don't do it to me.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.040
I'm begging you. I love you.
Please don't do this.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.876
Just come and say hi. Just say hi.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.628
I wish I could. I really do.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.464
I wish I could, okay?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.841
Sorry. I'm sorry about everything.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.760
All right? I got to go. I got to go.
[Maxine] Is cyanide sweet, though?

22:35.145 --> 22:37.606
Is that why Jim Jones
put it in the Kool-Aid?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.524
So the kids can't taste it?

22:39.608 --> 22:41.401
[Lizzy] Jonestown was bonkers.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.904
[Lizzy and Maxine speaking indistinctly]

22:47.949 --> 22:49.534
-[Lizzy] Right?
-[Maxine] Yeah.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.661
[Lizzy] But it's huge. I don't know.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.706
[Maxine] Wait, nothing we do
will be as devastating as that.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.291
-[Lizzy] Mm-hmm.
-[Maxine] Maybe...

22:56.792 --> 22:58.126
I should start a religion.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.545
-[buzzing repeatedly]
-Come on, man.
Please don't be fucking dead.

23:04.883 --> 23:05.842
Fuck.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.764
Yay. Uh...

23:10.847 --> 23:14.142
I'd like to report a gas leak...
every fucking day, please.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.436
