01:22.680 --> 01:26.130
Hey, kids, it's story time!

01:26.850 --> 01:31.144
I'm gonna tell you the story
of Krusty's expensive new suit:

01:31.355 --> 01:34.309
His sexual-harassment suit.

01:34.525 --> 01:36.102
Oh, boy.

01:36.318 --> 01:38.441
Anyway, as part of Krusty's
plea bargain...

01:38.612 --> 01:40.652
...he has a new
court-ordered sidekick...

01:40.864 --> 01:42.987
...Ms. No-Means-No.

01:44.326 --> 01:47.161
You're hot. Let's get some dinner
after the show.

01:48.789 --> 01:52.750
I have dinner with all my employees.
Right, Sideshow Mel?

01:52.292 --> 01:54.840
We've never spoken outside of work.

01:57.589 --> 02:00.923
I'm surprised he didn't blame
his problems on his Percodan addiction.

02:01.135 --> 02:03.174
Wasn't my fault. It was the Percodan.

02:03.345 --> 02:06.500
If you ask me,
that stuff rots your brain.

02:06.223 --> 02:08.500
And now a word from my new sponsor.

02:08.225 --> 02:11.143
Percodan?! Oh, crap!

02:12.146 --> 02:14.304
Bart, are you ready
for your history test?

02:14.523 --> 02:16.148
You bet, Mom. Ask me anything.

02:16.358 --> 02:20.605
Okay. Who was
George Washington Carver?

02:20.946 --> 02:22.855
The guy who chopped up
George Washington?

02:23.320 --> 02:24.490
Really?

02:37.379 --> 02:41.800
- Bart, you said you were going to study.
- My stomach.

02:41.258 --> 02:45.338
- You just don't wanna take that test.
- No, I mean it. It really hurts.

02:45.554 --> 02:47.179
Mom, I think he's serious.

02:47.681 --> 02:49.920
Kids are so naive.

02:49.266 --> 02:52.267
Lisa, when you get to be our age,
you'll learn a few things.

02:52.478 --> 02:54.885
Like when a sign says,
"Do not feed the bears"...

02:55.640 --> 02:57.389
...man, you'd better not
feed the bears.

02:57.566 --> 02:59.523
Now, get to school, boy.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.864
Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test.
I have a stomachache.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.983
Well, that's a lame excuse
for an excuse.

03:10.204 --> 03:13.489
Look, if you ignore me and I die,
you'll get in a lot of trouble.

03:13.707 --> 03:16.163
Read page six of the school charter.

03:16.377 --> 03:20.326
"No teacher shall be held accountable
if Bart Simpson dies."

03:20.547 --> 03:23.548
We're also absolved if Milhouse
gets eaten by the school snake.

03:23.717 --> 03:27.585
Hey, cool, there's a rabbit in here.

03:28.722 --> 03:33.431
Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test.
Can I please go to the nurse?

03:33.644 --> 03:35.471
Gosh, maybe you really are in pain.

03:35.646 --> 03:39.311
Well, it would be cruel
not to let you go.

03:49.451 --> 03:50.483
Now you may go.

03:52.121 --> 03:54.742
Lunchlady Doris, why are you here?

03:54.957 --> 03:58.824
Budget cuts. They've even got
Groundskeeper Willie teaching French.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.256
Bonjour, you cheese-eating
surrender monkeys.

04:03.465 --> 04:05.754
Look, my stomach really hurts.

04:05.968 --> 04:08.673
All I can give you are
these chewable Prozac for kids.

04:08.846 --> 04:13.424
Your choice: Manic-Depressive Mouse
or the Bluebird of Unhappiness.

04:14.977 --> 04:18.512
Superintendent Chalmers, meet
our new school nurse, Lunchlady Doris.

04:18.689 --> 04:22.687
Nice to see you. Seymour, why is that
student lying unconscious on the floor?

04:22.901 --> 04:25.274
Well, in many cases,
the floor is the best...

04:25.446 --> 04:27.853
Oh, look, here comes Lumpy,
the school snake.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.108
Help! Help!

04:30.326 --> 04:32.402
Oh, Lord.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.701
Don't worry, son. You'll be fine.

04:41.879 --> 04:44.714
This boy's appendix is inflamed
and about to burst...

04:44.882 --> 04:48.796
...which will make it easier to find
once I get in there.

04:50.763 --> 04:54.511
Man, these are primo seats.
I could really go for a hot dog.

04:54.683 --> 04:56.806
Homer, this is an operation.

04:56.977 --> 05:00.311
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!

05:00.522 --> 05:05.101
Okay, Bart, I will count to three,
and you will be sound asleep.

05:05.277 --> 05:07.947
One, two, three.

05:08.113 --> 05:10.735
- Out like a light.
- Scalpel.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.364
Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs.

05:17.289 --> 05:19.163
Hey, I smell gas.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.242
Pleasant gas.

05:21.418 --> 05:24.253
Night-night gas.

05:26.882 --> 05:29.171
How's my special little guy?

05:29.343 --> 05:31.798
How you feeling, big brother?

05:31.970 --> 05:34.888
Oh, this is wonderful. You're alive.

05:35.570 --> 05:38.930
- No thanks to you, Homer.
- Why, you little...

05:41.230 --> 05:44.813
Now, Homer, please. The boy's
just had a very serious operation.

05:44.984 --> 05:46.980
Oh, right.

05:47.690 --> 05:51.446
Now, Bart, I found the culprit:
A jagged, metal cereal O.

05:51.657 --> 05:54.409
Wicked. I got this cool scar.

05:54.618 --> 05:56.278
And I get to miss a week of school.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.112
Dr. Hibbert, can I have
my appendix out?

06:04.860 --> 06:05.960
Why not. Follow me, kids.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.621
Nurse, prep these children.

06:09.883 --> 06:12.719
I'm glad you're okay, Bart.

06:22.604 --> 06:24.147
Bleeding Gums Murphy.

06:24.356 --> 06:27.559
Little Lisa. It's good to see you again.

06:27.776 --> 06:29.816
It's been a long time.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.862
My friends call me Bleeding Gums.

06:34.740 --> 06:35.866
How'd you get a name like that?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.196
Let me put it this way.
You ever been to the dentist?

06:39.371 --> 06:40.450
- Yeah.
- Not me.

06:40.664 --> 06:45.659
I suppose I should go to one, but I
got enough pain in my life as it is.

06:46.462 --> 06:49.581
- What are you here for?
- My brother just had his appendix out.

06:49.798 --> 06:52.835
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.548
I'm doing my rounds,
and I'm a little behind.

06:55.971 --> 06:57.798
He'll be fine.

06:59.975 --> 07:04.684
Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by.
You're the first visitor I've had.

07:04.897 --> 07:07.566
- What about your family?
- I don't really have a family.

07:07.733 --> 07:10.936
All I had was a little brother
who grew up to become a doctor.

07:11.111 --> 07:14.943
He used to laugh
at the most inappropriate times.

07:15.282 --> 07:17.654
I've got an older brother
that I'll never see.

07:17.826 --> 07:21.409
He's a jazz musician or some such.
Oh, well. Bye-bye.

07:21.580 --> 07:24.332
It must be awful to be
all alone in the world.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.415
Well, I always had my music.

07:26.585 --> 07:30.203
I learned at the feet
of Blind Willy Witherspoon.

07:31.590 --> 07:35.339
I've been playing jazz for 30 years,
and I just can't make a go of it.

07:35.511 --> 07:37.503
I want you to have my saxophone.

07:37.721 --> 07:40.508
This isn't a saxophone,
it's an umbrella.

07:40.724 --> 07:42.764
So I've played a umbrella
for 30 years?

07:42.935 --> 07:44.346
Why didn't anybody tell me?

07:45.620 --> 07:48.680
- We all thought it was funny.
- That's not funny.

07:48.857 --> 07:53.400
Then I got my big break.
I was on Steve Allen's Tonight! Show.

07:55.114 --> 08:00.274
Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's
inspired me to do some improv poetry.

08:00.452 --> 08:03.619
Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat
How I wonder where you at

08:03.789 --> 08:06.743
I really love the way you cook
Like me, when I wrote this book

08:06.917 --> 08:08.328
How to Make Love to Steve Allen.

08:08.544 --> 08:11.820
From the author of
Happiness Is a Naked Steve Allen...

08:11.255 --> 08:16.830
...Journey to the Center of Steve Allen
and The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen.

08:16.301 --> 08:19.671
I cut my first and only album,
Sax on the Beach.

08:19.888 --> 08:24.883
But then I spent all my money
on my $ 1500-a-day habit.

08:25.769 --> 08:28.439
I'd like another FabergÃ© egg, please.

08:28.605 --> 08:32.602
- Sir, don't you think you've had enough?
- I'll tell you when I've had enough!

08:34.736 --> 08:36.645
When was the last time you worked?

08:36.864 --> 08:40.778
In '86, when I did a guest shot
on The Cosby Show.

08:41.784 --> 08:45.285
Hey, kids. Meet Grandpa Murphy.

08:45.497 --> 08:47.786
But we have three grandpas already.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.289
This one is a great jazz musician.

08:50.502 --> 08:52.127
They all are.

08:52.963 --> 08:56.628
You see, the kids,
they listen to the rap music...

08:56.800 --> 08:58.959
...which gives them the brain damage.

08:59.136 --> 09:03.383
With their hipping and the hopping
and the bipping and the bopping.

09:03.557 --> 09:07.471
So they don't know
what the jazz is all about.

09:07.686 --> 09:10.806
You see, jazz is like
a Jell-O Pudding Pop.

09:10.981 --> 09:13.899
No. Actually, it's more like Kodak film.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.437
No. Actually, jazz is like
the New Coke.

09:17.613 --> 09:20.186
It'll be around forever.

09:22.701 --> 09:24.658
Wow, you've had some career.

09:24.828 --> 09:28.660
Although the moral seems to be that
a life of jazz leaves you sad and lonely.

09:28.832 --> 09:33.245
Well, before you came to visit,
I would have agreed with you.

09:35.547 --> 09:39.470
This just in: Krusty the Clown staged
a press conference today...

09:39.218 --> 09:42.551
...to defend himself against charges
that his products are unsafe...

09:42.721 --> 09:44.465
...his theme park is a deathtrap...

09:44.640 --> 09:48.934
...and that he's marketing videos
of Tonya Harding's wedding night.

09:49.144 --> 09:51.137
I contend the tourists
were decapitated...

09:51.313 --> 09:55.620
...before they entered the Krustyland
House of Knives. Next question.

09:55.234 --> 10:00.524
What about that little boy who got
appendicitis from eating your cereal?

10:00.739 --> 10:05.485
To prove that this metal O is harmless,
I will personally eat one.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.408
See? There's nothing...

10:10.791 --> 10:15.120
Oh, boy!
This thing is shredding my insides!

10:15.296 --> 10:19.210
Krusty, that wasn 't the metal one.
That was a regular Krusty-O.

10:19.383 --> 10:20.925
It's poison.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.200
- So you all set for your recital?
- I sure am. Look.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.677
I stopped brushing my teeth
so I can play just like you.

10:30.394 --> 10:34.937
Lisa, honey, music comes from what's
in your heart, not what's on your teeth.

10:35.107 --> 10:36.850
Come on, let's jam.

11:31.997 --> 11:35.117
Hey, Moe, what will you give me
for an A.A. Chip?

11:35.334 --> 11:39.414
Barney, this is a five-minute chip.
It's worth a Pabst.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.834
Baby, you are gonna
knock them dead.

11:48.430 --> 11:50.637
Here, take this for luck.

11:51.225 --> 11:54.724
Your sax! Thank you so much.

12:00.984 --> 12:03.310
Now, I have learned that
most of the orchestra...

12:03.487 --> 12:05.314
...is having their appendixes removed.

12:05.489 --> 12:08.620
So without further ado,
I give you the remnants...

12:08.242 --> 12:11.770
...of the Springfield Elementary School
orchestra.

12:11.286 --> 12:15.201
On saxophone, Lisa Simpson.
On triangle, Martin Prince.

12:15.374 --> 12:19.502
And with a flute up his nose,
Ralph Wiggum.

12:20.296 --> 12:21.494
That's some nice fluting.

12:21.714 --> 12:23.671
They'll play
"Stars and Stripes Forever."

12:23.841 --> 12:25.917
Hopefully not forever.

12:31.307 --> 12:33.180
This sucks.

12:45.154 --> 12:49.365
Hey, Bleeding Gums, I was great!
And I owe it all to...

12:49.575 --> 12:51.340
What happened to Mr. Murphy?

12:51.243 --> 12:53.340
I'm sorry. He passed away.

13:06.383 --> 13:08.755
Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?

13:09.261 --> 13:13.930
Bleeding Gums was my hero,
and I never got to tell him how I felt.

13:13.307 --> 13:14.552
Oh, I'm sure he knew.

13:14.725 --> 13:17.560
And I'm sure that wherever he is now,
he's happy.

13:17.770 --> 13:22.266
But he was the only person who had
the same love for music that I do.

13:23.859 --> 13:25.318
Thank you.

13:25.486 --> 13:28.190
Oh, Dad, why did he have to die?

13:28.405 --> 13:32.652
Well, it's like the time that your cat,
Snowball, got run over.

13:32.826 --> 13:34.369
- Remember, honey?
- Yeah.

13:34.578 --> 13:37.690
What I'm saying is,
all we have to do...

13:37.247 --> 13:40.165
...is go down to the pound
and get a new jazzman.

13:40.334 --> 13:43.390
Oh, Dad!

13:46.256 --> 13:47.799
I blew it again.

13:47.966 --> 13:49.377
What?

13:52.388 --> 13:54.546
Hey, Lis, you still upset
about that jazz guy?

13:55.570 --> 13:58.580
If it helps,
I believe that after you die...

13:58.227 --> 14:00.599
...you can come back
as whatever you want.

14:00.771 --> 14:02.728
- I'll be a butterfly.
- How come?

14:02.898 --> 14:08.521
Because nobody ever
suspects the butterfly.

14:10.239 --> 14:11.816
I didn't burn down the school.

14:11.991 --> 14:15.270
It was the butterfly, I tell you.
The butterfly!

14:15.244 --> 14:17.367
He's crazy, boys. Get the Taser.

14:23.961 --> 14:27.793
Maybe I need to talk to somebody
with a little more age and wisdom.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.794
Death stalks you at every turn.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.631
- Grampa.
- Well, it does.

14:34.596 --> 14:36.423
There it is. Death!

14:36.598 --> 14:37.927
It's only Maggie.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.960
Oh, yeah.

14:40.269 --> 14:44.931
You know, at my age,
the mind starts playing tricks. So...

14:45.107 --> 14:47.479
- Death!
- That's only the cat.

14:48.485 --> 14:51.570
- Death!
- That's Maggie again, Grampa.

14:52.197 --> 14:54.985
Where were we? Death!

14:56.702 --> 14:59.240
How come it won't stop hurting?

14:59.788 --> 15:02.458
Lisa, it's normal to be sad
when a friend dies.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.701
And Bleeding Gums
was a good friend to you.

15:04.877 --> 15:08.246
But nobody is really gone
as long as we remember them.

15:08.464 --> 15:10.706
If you really want to preserve
his memory...

15:10.883 --> 15:15.675
...I recommend getting a tattoo.
It preserves the things you love.

15:16.430 --> 15:19.347
"Starland Vocal Band"? They suck!

15:19.767 --> 15:21.427
Death!

15:29.193 --> 15:33.440
- Isn't anybody gonna show up?
- Well, Lisa, we've waited an hour.

15:34.156 --> 15:37.691
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

15:37.868 --> 15:40.655
...to bid farewell
to Blood and Guts Murphy...

15:40.829 --> 15:43.783
No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.

15:43.958 --> 15:47.658
Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy
was quite the sousaphone player...

15:47.836 --> 15:51.122
Saxophone! He was a jazz musician.

15:51.340 --> 15:53.463
You didn't know him.
Nobody knew him.

15:53.675 --> 15:55.860
But he was a great man.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.965
And I won't rest
until all of Springfield...

15:58.138 --> 16:00.843
...knows the name
Bleeding Gums Murphy.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.590
And I won't rest
until I've gotten a hot dog.

16:03.769 --> 16:05.263
Homer, this is a cemetery.

16:05.437 --> 16:09.305
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!

16:09.483 --> 16:11.855
What do you do,
follow my husband around?

16:12.270 --> 16:15.396
Lady, he's putting my kids
through college.

16:19.952 --> 16:22.525
Good news, Bart.
The Krusty-O Cereal Corp...

16:22.705 --> 16:27.248
...has settled your case for $ 100,000,
less, of course, my legal fees.

16:27.459 --> 16:28.918
What kind of legal fees?

16:29.128 --> 16:30.752
Well, for a case this complex...

16:30.921 --> 16:33.495
...I had to assemble
a crack team of lawyers.

16:33.674 --> 16:35.713
Ronald Chaporo, trial attorney.

16:35.884 --> 16:39.419
Albert Dershman, who can hold
three billiard balls in his mouth.

16:39.638 --> 16:42.460
How much of the 100 thou do I get?

16:43.517 --> 16:45.344
Five hundred dollars?

16:45.561 --> 16:47.434
- Yes, well...
- Cool.

16:47.646 --> 16:50.647
Glad you're happy. Let's roll.

16:53.402 --> 16:55.975
I can't believe it. Five hundred bucks!

16:56.155 --> 16:59.571
Just think what I can do
with that money.

17:00.909 --> 17:03.661
Five hundred dollars on red.

17:04.872 --> 17:07.279
The winner is black.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.371
Cool.

17:09.585 --> 17:13.285
I wanna honor Bleeding Gums' memory,
but I don't know where to start.

17:13.505 --> 17:17.420
Maybe you could get the local
jazz station to do a tribute to him, huh?

17:17.593 --> 17:21.804
Jazz. They just make it up
as they go along. I could do that.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.137
- That's "Mary Had a Little Lamb."
- Okay, then this:

17:30.230 --> 17:33.231
That's the same thing.
You just replaced "dees" with "do's."

17:34.651 --> 17:38.210
I have a request. I'd like you to do
a tribute to Bleeding Gums Murphy.

17:38.197 --> 17:40.948
I'd love to, little sister,
but we don't have his album.

17:41.158 --> 17:43.234
- What if I could find it?
- I'd spin it.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.700
But ain't no one gonna hear it.

17:45.245 --> 17:47.119
Our broadcast range is only 23 feet...

17:47.289 --> 17:50.907
...which makes us the most powerful
jazz station in the entire U.S. Of A.

17:51.126 --> 17:53.000
Gee, your station has
a lot of problems.

17:53.212 --> 17:55.667
Tell me about it.
Just look at our morning guy.

17:55.881 --> 18:01.880
Hello. This is "Moleman in the Morning."
Good Moleman to you.

18:01.261 --> 18:04.465
Today, part four of our series
of the agonizing pain...

18:04.640 --> 18:07.676
...in which I live every day.

18:10.104 --> 18:12.511
Two hundred and fifty dollars?

18:12.731 --> 18:16.100
But I need that album to honor
the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy.

18:16.318 --> 18:18.774
He's dead?
Well, why didn't you say so?

18:24.702 --> 18:27.270
Where am I gonna get $500?

18:36.714 --> 18:39.390
Now drive, Smithers. Drive.

18:45.598 --> 18:47.970
Excuse me, my good man,
I have $500 to blow.

18:48.142 --> 18:51.760
- What have you got?
- Behold the ultimate Pog.

18:53.605 --> 18:55.479
I'll take it.

19:07.703 --> 19:11.748
Lisa, look what I've got. Ta-da!

19:12.374 --> 19:15.660
Bart, I can't believe it. But why?

19:15.836 --> 19:19.390
When I said my stomach hurt,
you were the only one who believed me.

19:19.214 --> 19:22.548
Oh, thank you. But $500...

19:22.718 --> 19:25.430
You'll never see that much
money again.

19:25.262 --> 19:27.385
Oh, yeah? Take a look at this.

19:31.185 --> 19:33.640
I got the album.

19:34.688 --> 19:37.358
Here. You can listen to it on this.

19:40.611 --> 19:43.695
I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums.

20:06.345 --> 20:09.346
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.

20:09.515 --> 20:12.219
Poison-gas cloud heading for...

20:14.812 --> 20:18.430
That's nice. Hey, it's getting cloudy.

20:19.817 --> 20:21.228
Oh, boy.

20:32.454 --> 20:35.206
That was for you, Bleeding Gums.

20:36.792 --> 20:40.125
You've made
an old jazzman happy, Lisa.

20:40.296 --> 20:44.708
You must avenge my death, Kimba.
I mean, Simba.

20:44.883 --> 20:47.900
Luke, I am your father.

20:47.261 --> 20:49.520
This is CNN.

20:49.221 --> 20:53.500
Will you guys pipe down?
I'm saying goodbye to Lisa.

20:53.183 --> 20:55.223
We're sorry.

20:55.436 --> 20:57.309
I don't want you to go.

20:57.521 --> 21:00.226
Sorry, but I have to. Goodbye.

21:01.483 --> 21:03.393
Goodbye.

21:07.573 --> 21:10.408
Oh, what the heck.
Once more, from the top.

22:19.728 --> 22:21.306
One more time!

22:21.480 --> 22:23.354
Oh, come on, Lisa.

22:23.524 --> 22:26.150
I got a date with Billie Holiday.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.106
