00:54.888 --> 00:56.139
I know you do that.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.224
-No, you don't.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.309
How'd you sleep?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.352
Not well.

01:01.436 --> 01:05.190
Your vegan-leather couch
is covered in fondue cheese

01:05.273 --> 01:07.400
and the irony is just too loud.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.778
-Stop doing that!

01:09.861 --> 01:12.739
I have to do something
to get my mind off last night.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.115
You heard from the kids?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.700
Not a peep.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.577
You think we got away with it?

01:17.660 --> 01:18.536
Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.040
They totally bought your nonsense
about recapturing the rats

01:22.123 --> 01:24.793
that you trained as therapy dogs.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.294
Well, they were on the fence,

01:26.377 --> 01:30.423
but I think once they see
their little orange vests, we've got 'em.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.425
Well, just in case,

01:32.926 --> 01:37.514
I'm gonna fix this damn house before
they decide they need to fix it for us.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.642
-We're gonna make this right, Frankie.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.393
-Or our insurance can.
-Right.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.688
I know I should know this,
but do we have insurance?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.482
Yes. We have a lot of insurance.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.860
So don't worry,
your ceramic cat-camel is covered.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.570
Good, 'cause I broke it.

01:59.744 --> 02:03.623
There's nothing to be scared of.
I'm right here with you.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.583
-I'm not scared, I--
-Shh!

02:05.667 --> 02:07.961
Shh! I'm talking to the rats.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.672
-Oh. Now I'm scared.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.466
Oh, shit.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.426
We need to talk.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.971
I thought we agreed that I was gonna say,
"We need to talk."

02:18.054 --> 02:20.390
Okay, wheels are off. I'm out.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.143
Don't move. Just stay there.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.520
I know what's going on here.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.150
Grace, you're in a safe space,
and we love you,

02:30.233 --> 02:33.486
but your drinking has affected me
in the following ways...

02:33.570 --> 02:37.323
-This isn't about my drinking.
-So let's get you a drink. I've got it.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.619
Well, if it's not her drinking,
I can't imagine what it could be about.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.832
Remember, this is a safe space.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.876
Jesus, fuck!

02:47.959 --> 02:51.129
Uh, not the physical space,
but the emotional space.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.006
Safe emotional space.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.591
Jesus, fuck.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.801
We did a little research last night.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.555
-And we found this checklist online.

03:00.638 --> 03:04.517
It's just a bunch of things
to look out for as your parents get older.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.352
Give me that stupid thing.

03:08.396 --> 03:14.944
"Scars Your Parrots May Be Deadly
for Asserted Leaving!"

03:15.028 --> 03:18.323
"Signs Your Parents May Be Ready
for Assisted Living!"

03:18.406 --> 03:20.033
Oh, God, that's even worse!

03:20.116 --> 03:23.494
We are not going to assisted living!
Are you insane?

03:23.953 --> 03:25.788
Just listen for a second.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.501
"Are there signs of neglect
around the house?"

03:30.585 --> 03:32.670
I don't see any.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.672
-Tub comes to mind.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.468
"Has your parent suffered
a recent physical setback?"

03:38.551 --> 03:40.428
This isn't a cane, it's a weapon.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.432
"Have you noticed changes
in your parent's coordination?

03:44.515 --> 03:46.726
Have there been unexplained bruises?"

03:46.809 --> 03:48.770
I can explain all my bruises.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.064
Tae Bo. Fight with a hammock.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.690
Slept on an Oreo.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.943
I don't need to sit here and take this.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.988
Seems like you do.

03:59.072 --> 04:03.409
"Does your loved one have trouble
getting up from a seated position?"

04:03.493 --> 04:06.412
Does your loved one have trouble
getting her middle finger up?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.331
Nope, works just fine.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.332
Okay.

04:09.874 --> 04:13.628
And as I leave you,
I am flipping you off with my mind.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.340
-Let's go.
-I mean, we tried to do it and... -now whatever happens to them is--
Come on!

04:20.802 --> 04:23.680
How could you even think
of putting us in a home?

04:23.763 --> 04:26.516
It's a retirement community.
Like the place Arlene lives. Like... exactly the place Arlene lives.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.313
It's independent living
with a lot of help.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.983
Support.
We decided to use the word "support."

04:35.066 --> 04:37.944
It's independent support
with a lot of help.

04:38.569 --> 04:42.198
Do you really not see yourselves
in some of the things on this list?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.324
No.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.577
And a different checklist
would say I'm doing just fine.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.788
Growing as an artist: check.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.624
Finding new things to fondue: check.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.295
Improvising a kick-ass checklist:
check-plus.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.089
Yeah. Founded two successful businesses:
check.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.301
Didn't run one of them into the ground:
check.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.428
Don't live in a shoe: check.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.556
We're concerned about you
living out here alone.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.725
Oh, don't be. We have each other.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.644
Yeah, that really helped

05:11.728 --> 05:15.148
when the two of you couldn't get up
off the floor for an entire day.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.317
See, I knew you were
gonna hang on to that.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.946
Look, we didn't need a Panic Alert then,
and we don't need to move now.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.824
How you can even suggest
we leave our home...

05:24.907 --> 05:26.617
Have you looked at it lately?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.244
Oh, God damn it!

05:28.328 --> 05:31.331
Are you forgetting
what this house means to us?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.458
This is where
we put our lives back together

05:33.541 --> 05:36.002
after your dumb gay dads ruined it all.

05:36.085 --> 05:39.797
Look, look, look, maybe we didn't
introduce this idea in the right way.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.215
You sure as hell didn't.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.635
And the only place I want to be
is away from you.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.013
Not you though.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.352
I'll go.

05:55.354 --> 05:56.272
Really?

05:56.856 --> 05:57.857
Fuck no!

05:57.940 --> 06:00.777
God damn it, I don't know
what's wrong with you!

06:02.487 --> 06:03.529
Ow.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.758
A certain someone I know
has a big smile on his face.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.219
A certain someone I know put it there.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.223
I guess we should let Roy
rub our ears more often.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.518
I guess we should.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.815
Maybe our therapist was onto something
when she told us to try new things.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.860
I'll confess I never thought
I'd get such a thrill

06:42.944 --> 06:44.904
watching someone else flirt with you.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.072
I know!

06:46.531 --> 06:48.783
I think I finally understand
<i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

06:48.866 --> 06:51.494
But how did the mask get on their bed?

06:51.577 --> 06:53.913
I don't know.
I didn't figure everything out.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.918
But I think maybe
we figured something out.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.880
About us.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.760
Sounds like something
we should talk more about...

07:07.844 --> 07:08.678
Mm-hmm.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.638
...while you finish making my breakfast.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.223
What?

07:13.599 --> 07:16.602
One good roll in the hay
and someone's a sass machine.

07:17.311 --> 07:20.523
I do manufacture sass. Carry on.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.109
No, just one bite.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.194
No, no! No, no!

07:25.278 --> 07:26.779
No, just one bite!

07:32.118 --> 07:35.663
We know you're upset,
but we did not mean to make you clean.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.206
Well, you did.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.583
Happy now?

07:38.666 --> 07:42.378
-We're sorry we ambushed you.
-But we're worried about Mom.

07:48.885 --> 07:49.844
Hey.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.724
Don't try to butter me up.

07:54.807 --> 07:59.812
Look, Grace, we both know
that you can take care of yourself.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.773
I mean, we were there
when that biker parked in your spot.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.609
But we're worried about our mom.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.821
She would never ask for help...

08:08.905 --> 08:11.657
or admit that she needs any, but she does.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.285
I know when we hear stories
like "Frankie got lost in Mexico,"

08:14.368 --> 08:16.204
it sounds all cute and funny.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.831
I know when you hear
Mom hit a cop car with a scooter,

08:18.915 --> 08:20.833
it sounds absolutely hilarious.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.627
But it's not cute or funny.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.337
It's scary.

08:24.420 --> 08:29.717
And Barry assures me it absolutely
was hilarious, but it's also bad.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.514
And now, with her other knee,
she's running out of knees.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.141
What happens if she falls down the stairs?

08:37.225 --> 08:40.645
-She will shatter into a million pieces.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.688
Will you be able
to scrape her up off the floor?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.650
Will you be able to get help
all the way out here in time?

08:45.733 --> 08:48.194
If you lived at Walden Villas,
help would be right there.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.656
-Whenever she needed it.
-Day or night. Just a button away.

08:51.739 --> 08:55.576
Maybe you don't need to be there,
but she does.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.621
And we can't imagine her
going anywhere without you.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.416
We know that this is a lot to ask.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.252
She came back from Santa Fe for you.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.963
But she would never
go anywhere without you again.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.772
Come on, girls.
We're going to be late for lunch.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.275
-I'll grab our table.
-Okay.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.071
How the hell did we get here?

09:32.822 --> 09:35.157
I think it all started with the tub.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.955
Well, thank God for that tub. Right?
It gave us the nudge we needed.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.749
Now we have a tub we can walk into.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.670
Well, it's really a shower,
but you're using it as a tub, so...

09:49.839 --> 09:51.424
Oh, that man is waving.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.719
Oh, no, he's choking.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.679
Oh, no, he's waving.

10:03.519 --> 10:07.565
Well, we better get to lunch
before Howard touches all the food.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.566
Ew.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.531
You go on without me.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.699
Again?

10:17.199 --> 10:19.577
But you've only been
to the dining hall once.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.787
Everyone's been asking me if you died.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.664
Well, it's such a long walk.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.083
Besides I have a ton of emails
I have to deal with,

10:26.167 --> 10:28.628
including a couple from Nick
that I've been avoiding.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.005
You know, you can't just move here
and not tell him.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.592
He's been in Japan for two months.
Maybe he moved there and didn't tell me.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.219
Has he pitched my idea for Japants?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.181
No, and he needs you
to stop sending him drawings.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.433
In fact,
that's what most of his emails are about.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.188
-Oh, God.
What

10:47.730 --> 10:49.940
I'm just looking for my blowtorch.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.109
With your eyes shut?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.154
I'm trying to visualize where I put it.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.783
I bet Robert borrowed it
when he and Sol came to visit.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.701
He kept asking about it.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.787
He kept asking you
to not use it near his hair.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.622
Like his hair doesn't need it.

11:04.997 --> 11:05.873
I'll text him.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.042
Oh, shit, where's my phone?

11:08.834 --> 11:11.629
Where's my phone? Okay.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.341
Sorry. My husband cut himself

11:15.424 --> 11:18.636
and now he's bleeding
all over the dining room table.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.347
Anyway, what were we just talking about?

11:22.223 --> 11:25.309
I don't remember, actually.
And I'm kind of worried about Jeff now.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.936
Oh, therapy.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.273
I'm so glad you guys are processing...
or whatever.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.067
Oh, it's been really helpful.

11:33.651 --> 11:37.530
Our therapist finally has us
self-actualizing as a gay couple.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.158
Yeah, I noticed the Pilobolus poster
in your bathroom.

11:41.742 --> 11:46.831
And she helped us unpack why our friend,
Roy, was such a turning point for us.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.708
We needed to be reminded of all the things
we love about each other,

11:49.792 --> 11:50.835
and Roy did that.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.504
He injected something into us
that was magical.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.880
I'll bet he did.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.800
No, no, no.
An open relationship is not for us.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.469
But a relationship with windows

12:00.553 --> 12:03.139
where we can bask
in the heat of the day together

12:03.222 --> 12:05.057
when there's something hot nearby,

12:05.141 --> 12:07.268
that we can handle.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.895
You guys have really rooted out

12:09.979 --> 12:12.940
-the most un-fun corners of being gay.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.651
Frankie just texted me the following:

12:15.734 --> 12:18.946
"You up?" Question mark.
"Blowtorch?" Question mark.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.657
And then a little picture
of a black woman praying.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.659
I don't know, man.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.494
Everything okay with them?

12:26.454 --> 12:28.706
They have some stuff going on.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.917
They actually moved
into a retirement community.

12:32.001 --> 12:36.505
Wow. Sometimes I forget
how much older you guys are than I am.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.674
-You laugh, young man,

12:38.758 --> 12:43.387
but someday, you will look in the mirror
and all you will see are the years lost,

12:43.471 --> 12:45.473
the dreams deferred and--

12:45.973 --> 12:46.807
Oh!

12:47.558 --> 12:49.852
-Roy texted.
He's coming back to town
and would like to drop by.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.648
Oh, my God. Shut up.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.734
-He was casual.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.237
Then I think we should be casual back,
but funny.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.530
But not too funny.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.449
-You do it.
-No, you do it.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.575
I'm uncomfortable.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.037
Okay, I'll do it. What should I say?

13:12.917 --> 13:15.127
-Knock, knock.
-Come in.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.004
Hi! It's Katie!

13:17.087 --> 13:18.172
Hi, Katie.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.886
Hey. What's going on here, honey?

13:23.969 --> 13:26.889
I don't know, Raha. What do you see?

13:26.972 --> 13:30.935
I saw you weren't at lunch.
We've been missing you in the dining hall.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.438
Well, you don't know this about me,
but I don't eat.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.567
Oh, we have liquid meals available
if that's more comfortable for your body.

13:38.651 --> 13:43.239
I have plenty
of liquid meals here, thank you.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.909
And, um... I'm sort of busy.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.827
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

13:48.911 --> 13:53.457
Residents aren't allowed to operate
businesses out of their apartments.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.209
It's a zoning thing.

13:56.377 --> 14:00.005
But, unfortunately, there's no painting
allowed outside the art room.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.840
Art rooms are for dilettantes.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.801
I am a locally-famous artist

14:03.884 --> 14:08.722
who's been written up in a series
of well-respected prison newsletters.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.599
We have a newsletter here, too,

14:10.683 --> 14:14.103
but we can't spotlight residents
who don't follow the rules.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.313
I'm not like the other residents.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.440
I'm just here because of my friend.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.818
That's the thing,
I don't need to follow the rules.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.821
I'm just here for my friend,
looking after her.

14:23.904 --> 14:28.409
And the only reason I can stand being here
is because I'm running my business.

14:28.492 --> 14:32.580
You know, kind of that thing in between
a resident and someone who works here.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.539
A visitor?

14:33.622 --> 14:37.251
More of a long-term visitor
who eats for two.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.461
Basically, an employee.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.423
But running a business
is sort of antithetical

14:42.506 --> 14:45.593
to the whole idea
of "retirement" community.

14:45.676 --> 14:50.180
Yeah, I'm not a fan
of "retirement" or "community."

14:50.264 --> 14:51.974
Well, I'm not a fan of working here,

14:52.057 --> 14:55.936
but Invisaligns don't pay for themselves
and my girlfriend says I need them.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.650
So if there are keys that you have
that I should have...

15:01.859 --> 15:03.360
Ah, hey, hey.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.825
Raha, are you getting my keys?

15:17.666 --> 15:21.503
I'm so glad you two
decided to join me for this.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.839
And what is this class exactly

15:26.258 --> 15:28.802
Well, it's called "Look Great, Feel Good."

15:28.886 --> 15:30.012
Currently, I'm neither.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.682
Yeah. I mean,
I'm fine with the "Look Great."

15:33.766 --> 15:35.768
I haven't felt good since 1992,

15:35.851 --> 15:38.395
but, you know, who cares? I look great.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.649
Well, you have to admit,
these clothes are comfortable.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.193
Grace, how do your knees feel
in those shoes?

15:44.276 --> 15:48.030
Oh, my knees are fine.
My feet feel profound shame.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.951
If you really wanted a new outfit,
I would've taken you shopping.

16:00.125 --> 16:00.960
Hiya, Kooky.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.258
Thanks for telling me about this,
by the way.

16:08.342 --> 16:12.763
I'm sorry, but everything
just happened so fast and you were away.

16:13.722 --> 16:17.977
And the upstairs tub fell into the kitchen
and everything just got worse from there.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.812
-Yeah.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.188
I'll call my guy.

16:21.271 --> 16:24.400
It's a little late for that.
The kids put the house on the market.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.777
What? You love that place.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.988
I... I can't think about it.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.615
-I can have it fixed.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.826
It's not just about fixing a house.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.747
Frankie couldn't live there anymore.
And I couldn't leave her.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.085
So get a cute craftsman
with a little basement for her to haunt.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.295
You know something? The truth is, the house
was getting too much for me, too.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.009
I hired a contractor and he ripped me off.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.929
They all do.
-No, this is different. He scammed me.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.473
I never would have fallen
for that crap before.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.560
So we'll call a lawyer.
If that doesn't work, I'll call a hit man.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.687
I never said that. I did say that.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.690
You're not understanding, Nick.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.900
It's not understandable!

17:06.984 --> 17:10.362
I come back to town
and you are in a home!

17:10.863 --> 17:13.032
This is a retirement community!

17:13.115 --> 17:16.368
What difference does it make?
You don't belong here.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.663
Look, I may be here a little early,
but I'm gonna end up here anyway.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.416
I have explained this trajectory
to you before.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.792
Repeatedly!

17:23.876 --> 17:26.628
And has it given me pause
even for one second?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.213
Well, it seems like it is now.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.633
No. No, no, don't put this on me.
I don't care where you live.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.428
We can still do all the same things
we talked about.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.805
Chartering a boat, sailing to Peru.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.932
And then what, climbing Machu Picchu?

17:39.016 --> 17:41.310
I can't even climb Mount St. The Stairs.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.855
So we'll do Istanbul
and jet-ski on the Bosphorus.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.943
Now this is where you say,
"Istanbul, yes, jet-skiing, no."

17:50.027 --> 17:53.280
And then I say, "Fine, I didn't want
to leave the Four Seasons anyway."

17:56.200 --> 17:59.411
I'm sorry, Nick.
I can't play this game anymore.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.921
Is this another test?
Because you know me, Grace.

18:09.004 --> 18:12.007
I'll buy the whole damn place
and move in right next to you!

18:16.303 --> 18:18.180
This place isn't for you, Nick.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.317
Well, my college roommate
was an art major,

18:30.400 --> 18:32.986
and he said they needed a model
for his drawing class.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.488
What he neglected to tell me--

18:34.571 --> 18:38.408
-Was that you'd be nude.
-I think it was a ploy to get in my pants.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.870
You and I had very different
college experiences.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.039
How often did you eat soup in a blazer?

18:44.123 --> 18:47.126
I modeled nude for Frankie once.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.253
I caught pneumonia and almost died.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.462
Sad, Sol.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.214
Still have the drawing Frankie did of you?

18:52.589 --> 18:54.967
Painting. And somewhere, yes.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.261
I'd like to see it sometime.

18:58.137 --> 18:58.971
Oh...

19:00.472 --> 19:01.682
Well...

19:03.475 --> 19:07.563
Back in the day, I was first runner-up
in a James Dean look-alike contest.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.982
Actually, the winner was disqualified

19:10.065 --> 19:14.820
when it was revealed he and Dean
were distant cousins. So, I won.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.323
You know, I can just picture you
with your floppy hair.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.791
-Boy, it's late.
-It's not even five. But you said you had that thing
you had to get to.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.379
Oh, I lied to sound fancy.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.882
Well, it was nice seeing you either way.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.302
Are you guys trying to get rid of me?

19:38.385 --> 19:40.721
No, no, this was so much fun.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.348
-No. We liked that.

19:43.432 --> 19:47.102
-Not we, he liked it. I liked watching it.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.478
You like watching?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.815
No! Yes. Well, no.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.693
It's okay. I think I get it.

19:55.777 --> 20:00.949
I mean, I've never been used
quite like this before, but, um...

20:01.033 --> 20:03.577
that is what's happening here, right?

20:06.371 --> 20:09.333
God, Roy, we didn't mean to use you.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.627
I know. Boo-hoo for the guy
with five percent body fat.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.337
Is it that low? Oh...

20:15.380 --> 20:16.548
I think I should go.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.012
No, Roy, wait. Please.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.014
This isn't us.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.015
We feel terrible.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.476
It's just that...
we've been in therapy, see, and--

20:27.559 --> 20:29.186
-And it's been a disaster.
-Yes.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.605
And our therapist is clinically insane.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.106
We've been really unhappy with her.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.817
-She doesn't take our insurance.
-Parking's a nightmare.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.028
-So whatever's happening here--
-It's her fault.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.989
So please stay for dinner
and let us prove that we're normal.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.492
If you leave, she wins.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.330
All right.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.166
All right. Look, I'm not gonna lie.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.420
I saw the pork chops in your fridge,
and I want 'em bad.

20:55.837 --> 20:58.215
-Oh.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.009
I'm so sorry, honey.

21:01.510 --> 21:05.222
You want me to go beat him up for you?
I've been taking chair-karate.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.432
If you can get him seated, I can take him.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.725
No, thank you.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.936
You know what this situation needs?

21:11.019 --> 21:12.688
-Don't say fondue.
-Fondue.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.941
-Nothing.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.026
Where's my fondue pot?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.696
Isn't it where you left it?
Stuck to the counter?

21:20.779 --> 21:24.074
-No!
-Oh, it was probably confiscated.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.285
-Because of the open flame.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.287
It's a whole liability thing.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.123
But cold fondue is just Velveeta.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.624
It's in your contract.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.211
The employees reserve the right
to remove any item deemed

21:36.295 --> 21:38.046
too dangerous for the residents. But they can't just steal our stuff.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.719
Oh, they don't steal it, they put it
into a storage closet for safekeeping.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.179
And when you die,
your family gets it back.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.724
Where is this closet?

21:54.313 --> 21:58.358
Take away a man's bong,
you take away his dignity.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.569
Waffle irons are dangerous?

22:00.652 --> 22:01.737
They certainly can be.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.490
Have I ever told you the true story
of how my yurt exploded?

22:05.574 --> 22:09.870
No, you always get so frustrated
by your own interruptions, you give up. It was President's Day,
and the humidity was...

22:14.708 --> 22:17.044
That's my fondue pot!

22:17.127 --> 22:18.503
Hey, is this your blowtorch?

22:19.087 --> 22:20.005
Portia.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.508
Oh, my God.
Those fascists kidnapped her.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.845
I know. This is bullshit.
Let's get out of here.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.056
Oh, we could use a new toaster.

22:29.139 --> 22:32.225
No, no, we can't. It's against the rules.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.353
Well, of course it is. There's a rule
for everything in this damn place.

22:35.437 --> 22:39.775
I know. I can't birth my art
where it demands to be born.

22:39.858 --> 22:44.321
Do you know they will not let us
run Vybrant in our apartment?

22:44.404 --> 22:46.198
Are we still doing that?

22:46.281 --> 22:47.991
Yes!

22:48.075 --> 22:50.202
All these dumb rules.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.871
You know
where they don't have dumb rules?

22:53.288 --> 22:54.206
Our house.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.208
Well, yeah, but you can't go there.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.126
What do you mean, I can't go there?

22:58.960 --> 22:59.961
Well, because...

23:01.046 --> 23:02.547
You know why.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.383
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.093
Because of you.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.678
Because of me?! No, it's because of you.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.139
No, I came here for you.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.017
Because you're a porcelain figurine.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.937
I came here for you,
because you're Mrs. Magoo.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.523
But I've always been Mrs. Magoo.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.483
Yeah, and I haven't shattered yet.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.194
I mean, if a part falls off,
just glue it back on.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.363
Oh, my God.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.658
We have been<i> Parent Trapped.</i>

23:30.575 --> 23:33.245
It made so much sense
when the kids laid it out.

23:34.412 --> 23:37.874
-Boy, I'd like to lay them out.
-I'd like to see you do it, too.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.711
Did you really come here for me?

23:42.462 --> 23:43.839
Of course.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.591
I knew you'd do the same for me.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.844
And you did.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.933
Well, since we came here for each other,

23:55.433 --> 23:57.519
can we leave for each other?

23:58.979 --> 23:59.813
Done.

24:03.441 --> 24:05.068
-This.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.281
What is taking so long?

24:09.364 --> 24:12.159
If it were really an emergency,
I'd be way dead.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.869
Yeah. Oh, shh. Here he comes.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.997
Oh, good. It's the dumb, handsy one.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.462
Just arriving at the No-No Room. Stand by.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.132
Go. Go. Go. Go.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.467
Uh-uh-uh-uh. I'm driving.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.344
You've got a history with carts.

24:31.428 --> 24:35.307
-Yeah, you're famously such a good driver.
-Well, thank you.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.685
-Yes. Sort of.

24:40.854 --> 24:41.771
Yeah, I do.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.194
Oh, this is great!
Oh!

24:47.777 --> 24:49.112
Okay, here we go.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.989
Whoo-hoo!

24:51.072 --> 24:52.449
Ma'ams, you need to sign those out!

24:52.532 --> 24:54.743
We don't have to do a freaking thing!

24:54.826 --> 24:57.370
-Go that way.
-I will after I go this way. Wait.

24:58.455 --> 25:01.249
Hey, this thing has
a great turning radius.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.959
I'm calling<i> Consumer Reports.</i>

25:03.043 --> 25:04.753
Oh, God, not now.

25:06.630 --> 25:11.259
You know what's hard to say
when you're drunk? Arnold Palmer.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.346
Arnol Plammer.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.681
You're right.

25:17.515 --> 25:20.685
It's just tea and lemonade. Big whoop.

25:22.145 --> 25:26.316
Speaking of more wine,
where is Roy with the scotch?

25:27.943 --> 25:30.487
Posthaste with the Roy, scotch!

25:33.281 --> 25:34.532
You take that neat...

25:35.533 --> 25:36.701
or on the rocks?

25:57.222 --> 25:58.265
Hmm...

25:59.307 --> 26:00.850
Hmm... Go that way.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.312
-No, I was wrong, go that way.
Oh, God.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.357
No, that was too far,
you gotta go back a little that way.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.567
-And then to the left.

26:10.485 --> 26:11.319
Duh.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.571
But you do have to go to the right. That--

26:13.655 --> 26:16.783
Where the hell did you guys park?
Because like nine people yelled at me.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.536
-It's in the cake.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.621
Right. There's a series of clues--

26:21.705 --> 26:23.999
-Oh, fuck this family!
-Kidding! I'm kidding!

26:25.834 --> 26:27.168
Where the hell are they?

26:31.381 --> 26:32.590
Come on. Floor it, Frankie!

26:32.674 --> 26:35.969
I've been flooring it the whole while.
This is as fast as it goes.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.595
Look, we're almost there!

26:37.679 --> 26:39.097
Whoo-hoo!

26:39.180 --> 26:42.350
Ocean, here I come! Oh, God.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.938
-So close.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.773
I guess we're walking.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.527
Come on. Ugh.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.327
What are we gonna do about the cart?

27:00.410 --> 27:02.203
What cart? I don't see a cart.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.416
Wait.

27:06.875 --> 27:07.792
Come on.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.421
Am I wrong to never want
to talk to our kids again?

27:11.504 --> 27:13.715
We're gonna punish 'em for this.

27:13.798 --> 27:17.218
You can go back into business
with Brianna. That would punish her.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.138
And you can de-alphabetize
Bud's cookbook collection.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.557
-That would punish him.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.268
She's got a million kids
and he lives in a shoe.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.020
They're punishing themselves.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.067
It's not a race.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.985
That's loser talk.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.489
Oh.

27:44.662 --> 27:45.663
Home.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.626
What were we thinking?

28:04.307 --> 28:05.934
