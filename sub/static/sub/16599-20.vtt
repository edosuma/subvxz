<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:02.769 --> 00:04.703
Danny, what are you doing here?

00:04.738 --> 00:05.971
Uh, this is my partner,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.939
Steve McGarrett.

00:07.974 --> 00:10.375
Steve, this is my
lovely ex-wife, Rachel.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.445
Rachel is moving back in
with Stan.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.546
The baby's his?

00:14.581 --> 00:17.549
Turns out, uh, she's further
along than she thought.

00:17.584 --> 00:18.650
Um...

00:18.685 --> 00:19.851
she's gonna try to make it work

00:19.886 --> 00:21.586
with Stan, for the--
for the kid's sake.

00:21.621 --> 00:23.555
I'm sorry, Danny.

00:24.924 --> 00:27.592
You had no right
to do that.

00:27.627 --> 00:28.727
You understand that?

00:28.762 --> 00:30.528
You had no right to
keep that from me,

00:30.563 --> 00:31.463
that I got a son.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.365
What about Stan?

00:33.400 --> 00:34.466
What does he know?

00:34.501 --> 00:36.368
He knows now.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.271
Hey, Five-O.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.439
Show me your
hands. Hands!

00:41.775 --> 00:43.642
STEVE:
Got a piece.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.477
We ran your prints,
your name's Harry Brown.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.445
30 years
with the HPD, huh?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.579
A highly decorated
officer.

00:48.615 --> 00:52.651
And if I might add, poker
buddies with your old man.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.387
STEVE:<i> Hey, you could take all</i>

00:55.422 --> 00:56.621

a gut instinct

00:56.656 --> 00:58.490

00:58.525 --> 01:00.492
Well, it's good to know that's

Am I, uh, am I crazy
or is it my day

03:28.808 --> 03:30.008

I don't believe you.

(chuckles)
No.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.700
Not really. Um...

03:57.770 --> 03:59.805
I'm getting a divorce.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.775
I'm beginning to think
I'm not very good

04:03.810 --> 04:05.076
at this whole marriage thing.

04:05.111 --> 04:06.945
No, no,
'cause, you know,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.480
it takes two people

04:08.515 --> 04:09.748
to wreck a relationship.
I know that.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.083
You guys, y-you, um,

04:12.118 --> 04:14.152
you tried to talk to somebody?
Get some help?

04:14.187 --> 04:15.587
Yeah, we've been
seeing a therapist,

04:15.622 --> 04:16.821
but do you know
what they said?

04:16.856 --> 04:17.622
Uh-uh.

04:17.657 --> 04:18.756
Get a divorce.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.792
Okay,
so you got the wrong therapist.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.794
It's not the
therapist, Danny.

04:22.829 --> 04:26.030
It's just not working
and the truth is,

04:26.065 --> 04:28.733
it hasn't been
working for a while.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.670
Did you, um...

04:32.705 --> 04:33.805
tell the kids?

04:33.840 --> 04:34.973
Not yet.

04:35.008 --> 04:35.974
That's it?

04:36.009 --> 04:36.975
There's no fixing it or...

04:37.010 --> 04:38.142
Stan says it's what he wants

04:38.177 --> 04:39.911
and I don't know what more
I can do.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.180
(sighs)
Okay.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.551
Here comes Charlie.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.722
Hi, Charlie.

04:50.757 --> 04:51.923
CHARLIE:
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Danno.

05:05.672 --> 05:06.805
STEVE: Hey. - Hmm.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.641
You want these?

05:11.878 --> 05:13.278
I don't need 'em.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.914
You see, my
boating days

05:15.949 --> 05:17.882
and my dreaming-about-boating
days are over now.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.985
Yeah, that's right, my friend,
those dreams have been scuttled.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.054
Wrecked, ruined.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.923
Laying at the bottom
of the ocean.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.891
What are you
talking about?

05:26.926 --> 05:28.125
(sighs)
Well,

05:28.161 --> 05:33.031
Samantha went and got herself
accepted into Northwestern.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.098
That's fantastic.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.034
Lou, congratulations,
that's terrific.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.036
Oh, yeah. That's fantastic

05:38.071 --> 05:39.938
for a man with no dreams
of boat ownership.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.974
Or maybe a
multimillionaire.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.343
But for my soon
to be broke ass,

05:45.378 --> 05:47.946
now I'll have to just settle
for being a land-captain.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.316
You know that stupid Internet
says that this thing

05:51.351 --> 05:52.884
is gonna cost
me 70 grand.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.119
But then, they only
set aside three grand

05:55.154 --> 05:57.856
for "other expenses."

05:58.891 --> 06:01.593
Seems a little low to me.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.961
Damn right it's too low.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.796
You seen them college textbooks,
man?

06:04.831 --> 06:06.197
Them things is thick
as a phonebook.

06:06.232 --> 06:08.700
You know how expensive
this is gonna be?

06:08.735 --> 06:11.369
I guarantee you I won't see
change from $150,000.

06:11.404 --> 06:14.105
Which is more than me and Renee
paid for our first house.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.240
It's a good school, this one
that Sammy got into, right?

06:16.275 --> 06:18.042
So it's gonna be
a good degree,

06:18.077 --> 06:19.043
right?

06:19.078 --> 06:20.778
If it's a good degree,

06:20.813 --> 06:21.846
she's probably gonna
get a good job.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.683
Hey.
Good money, right?

06:25.718 --> 06:29.721
You can guilt that kid into
buying you whatever you want.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.623
Yeah.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.957
Yeah, except
for by then,

06:32.992 --> 06:35.360
she'll be sitting
where I'm sitting,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.996
with her own damn kids
to send to college.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.831
Look, don't
get me wrong,

06:39.866 --> 06:41.966
I'm proud as hell of Samantha;
she graduated high school

06:42.001 --> 06:43.868
with honors
and as far as I can tell,

06:43.903 --> 06:45.136
she don't have a boyfriend.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.705
But let me tell you
what else that means.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.174
That means I won't be walking
around here spouting off

06:50.209 --> 06:52.877
any Williams-style
retirement talk.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.412
I'm in this for the long haul.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.147
I'm riding this wave

06:56.182 --> 06:58.750
all the way to the beach,
and by beach,

06:58.785 --> 07:00.752
I mean cemetery.
(phone rings)

07:00.787 --> 07:02.253
Good. Good.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.921
McGarrett.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.923
Copy that.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.158
Copy that,
we're on the way.

07:07.193 --> 07:10.862
Security situation
downstairs.

07:10.897 --> 07:14.666
Sir, I want you to stay right
where you are. Do not move.

07:14.701 --> 07:15.700
Hey.

07:15.735 --> 07:16.968
What's going on?

07:17.003 --> 07:17.769
He set off the metal detector.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.070
Guy had a concealed weapon
on him.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.339
Says he knows you.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.341
DISPATCHER (over radio):
10-32, signal 10-13.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.177
Harry.

07:26.212 --> 07:27.345
Hiya, kid.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.015
Yeah, he knows me.
Get up, Harry.

07:40.927 --> 07:41.993
(stapler snaps)

07:42.028 --> 07:44.062
(Grover and Steve groan)

07:44.097 --> 07:45.830
STEVE: Did one of our
security boys downstairs

07:45.865 --> 07:46.764
give you this?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.900
This? No, this is
a preexisting condition.

07:48.935 --> 07:49.967
Hmm.

07:50.002 --> 07:50.868
Wait.
- Um,

07:50.903 --> 07:52.437
please try and stay
still, Mr. Brown.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.138
Are you thinking about
getting a boat?

07:54.173 --> 07:55.840
What, are you out of your mind?

07:55.875 --> 07:56.908
You should do it.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.243
Nothing like being rocked
to sleep by the ocean.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.945
Yes. - NOELANI: All right, well,

08:00.980 --> 08:02.714
I closed up the wound,
but he's gonna have to

08:02.749 --> 08:03.981
remove these staples
in a week or so.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.717
Noelani, thank you very much
for coming up.

08:05.752 --> 08:06.951
We really appreciate it.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.885
As I mentioned before,
Commander,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.754
I'm very happy to help out
whenever I can,

08:09.789 --> 08:11.989
but are these house calls
gonna become a regular thing?

08:12.024 --> 08:13.791
Because emergency
medicine

08:13.826 --> 08:14.892
isn't really what I do.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.062
Wait. What do you do?

08:18.097 --> 08:19.731
I normally deal with
dead bodies.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.432
Well, you take much longer,

08:21.467 --> 08:23.101
you may have another one
on your hands.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.970
STEVE: No, I think this'll be,
uh, the last for awhile.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.809
Are you feeling dizzy?
Any nausea?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.044
Only when I
drink tequila.

08:33.946 --> 08:34.946
I'm trying to establish whether

08:34.981 --> 08:35.980
or not you have a concussion.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.015
I don't. Trust me.

08:38.050 --> 08:40.084
You know,
I'm a original leatherhead.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.220
I played fullback
from Pop Warner

08:42.255 --> 08:43.921
all the way
through college.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.523
Real skull cracker. This?

08:45.558 --> 08:47.959
This is just a little ding
on the dome, is all.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.260
Very well, then.

08:49.295 --> 08:50.995
Well, thanks again, Noelani.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.098
We guarantee your next body
will be a dead body.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.399
(chuckles)
- I promise.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.535
Feel better,
Mr. Brown.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.437
Thanks for
looking after me, doc.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.571
Thanks again.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.110
You want to do us a favor
and tell us what happened here?

09:06.145 --> 09:09.113
I got coldcocked.
The guy came at me from behind.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.081
Mm-hmm.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.215
GROVER:
Well, presumably,

09:11.250 --> 09:13.851
Harry, the man hit you
for some reason.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.220
STEVE: I see you got a new piece
poking out of your jacket.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.056
You back in the P.I. game,
pissing people off again?

09:19.091 --> 09:21.325
Let's just say I made a
couple of bad investments.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.027
I needed some cash.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.930
So, I un-retired myself
and took a job.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.532
Supposed to just be recon.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.967
It was an older guy
named Thomas Stratham.

09:30.002 --> 09:32.403
Was married to a younger broad
named Celine.

09:32.438 --> 09:36.107
Old Tommy, he's loaded.
Also got himself a chronic case

09:36.142 --> 09:37.408
of the green-eyed
monster.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.043
Wanted me to look
into his wife,

09:39.078 --> 09:42.847
see if she had a little
something going on the side.

09:42.882 --> 09:43.981
GROVER:
Well?

09:44.016 --> 09:45.149
Did she?

09:45.184 --> 09:47.185
No.
Followed her for a few weeks.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.220
Was gonna give my report
to Stratham,

09:49.255 --> 09:52.824
but, you know, he's paying
my day rate plus expenses,

09:52.859 --> 09:54.125
I didn't see the point

09:54.160 --> 09:56.160
in jumping to any
hasty conclusions.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.129
(laughs)

09:58.164 --> 09:59.997
So, I was still tailing her
this morning.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.033
<i>Right after</i>
<i>she gets her 7:00 a.m.</i>

10:02.068 --> 10:03.234
<i>medium skinny chai whatever,</i>

10:03.269 --> 10:05.603
<i>she's grabbed.</i>
<i>Right in front of me.</i>

10:05.638 --> 10:06.571
(tires screeching)

10:07.573 --> 10:08.906
<i>Of course, instinct kicks in.</i>

10:08.941 --> 10:09.907
<i>You know what it's like, Steve.</i>

10:09.942 --> 10:11.142
All right, stop!

10:11.177 --> 10:12.143
<i>Before you know</i>
<i>what you're doing,</i>

10:12.178 --> 10:15.146
<i>you're in a situation.</i>
<i>Guy blindsided me.</i>

10:16.282 --> 10:17.448
(tires screeching)

10:17.483 --> 10:19.517
Did you get a look
at these guys' faces?

10:19.552 --> 10:22.019
Well, they were wearing masks.
It all happened so fast.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.255
But I did get a partial plate
on the car.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.923
You call HPD with that?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.225
No, I called Mr. Stratham.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.227
You know, I mean,
the crew had already reached out

10:29.262 --> 10:31.896
with their demands. Plus,

10:31.931 --> 10:34.098
the usual speech about
"no cops," but, you know,

10:34.133 --> 10:36.534
once Five-O, always Five-O,
right, Steve?

10:36.569 --> 10:39.437
But I have to admit,
I was feeling a little bit

10:39.472 --> 10:42.139
out of my depth with
a kidnapping deal.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.006
A few years back, that punk

10:43.042 --> 10:45.109
never would have
gotten the drop on me.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.344
Would you do me a favor?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.012
Cut yourself some slack,
all right?

10:48.047 --> 10:49.914
You did the right thing coming
up here to talk to us.

10:49.949 --> 10:53.117
Look, we should go see Stratham.
He's expecting another call

10:53.152 --> 10:55.119
with the details
of the exchange.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.388
Uh, yeah, just pump
the brakes there, chief.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.057
You got a head
full of staples.

11:00.092 --> 11:02.026
You sure you're up
for something like this, Harry?

11:02.061 --> 11:04.295
I like this guy.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.299
STRATHAM:
<i>What? No!</i>

11:08.334 --> 11:10.334
They were very clear--
no cops.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.037
Have you ever heard of
"misprision," a felony?

11:13.072 --> 11:14.171
I can't go anywhere,

11:14.206 --> 11:15.105
even if I want to.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.074
Mr. Stratham,
I understand your anxiety,

11:17.109 --> 11:19.377
but you need to know that
you're ten times more likely

11:19.412 --> 11:21.612
to get your wife back safely
if you let us help you

11:21.647 --> 11:23.347
than if you go after this alone,
all right?

11:23.382 --> 11:24.482
We know the playbook.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.616
We have resources
at our disposal

11:25.651 --> 11:27.919
that private citizens
do not have.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.654
We're up on all the phones.
Thank you.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.455
This is Officer Kalakaua.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.257
She's gonna be here
to run a trace

11:33.292 --> 11:35.259
when those kidnappers
call you back.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.628
You have any idea
who these people are, Tom?

11:37.663 --> 11:39.330
No, no, no.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.332
The voice on the call
was distorted.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.701
Look, all I know is I got
to get a million together

11:43.736 --> 11:45.102
in three hours,
so, please,

11:45.137 --> 11:47.371
you have to get her back, okay?

11:47.406 --> 11:49.707
Celine... I don't know
what I'd do without her.

11:49.742 --> 11:54.011
Okay, and you-- you have to
let us do what we do, okay?

11:54.046 --> 11:56.013
Please.
- Why don't you come with me?

11:56.048 --> 11:58.016
All right?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.387
(chuckling):
Hey...

12:04.123 --> 12:06.090
Oh.
- Hairdo, long time.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.124
How are you, buddy?

12:07.159 --> 12:08.626
I'm doing good.
- Yeah?

12:08.661 --> 12:10.561
Good? What about
retirement-- no?

12:10.596 --> 12:13.998
Eh... turns out
sitting around at home

12:14.033 --> 12:16.734
watching old cop shows
may work for some people,

12:16.769 --> 12:18.703
but I'm not one of 'em.
- Mmm.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.204
I guess this life's in my blood.
Hard job to do,

12:20.239 --> 12:21.706
harder still to let go.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.975
How about that?
You should listen to this guy.

12:24.010 --> 12:24.976
He knows what he's
talking about.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.644
He put you up to saying that.
I know he did.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.046
He wants me to die
on the job with him

12:29.081 --> 12:30.080
instead of retiring, huh?

12:30.116 --> 12:32.149
I got no idea what you're talking about.
- Oh.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.019
Okay, uh, what's going on?

12:35.054 --> 12:36.387
I got a theory,
all right?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.089
What if it wasn't
a coincidence

12:38.124 --> 12:39.290
that Celine got grabbed
where she did?

12:39.325 --> 12:42.126
I mean the location
and the exact time.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.494
Harry, you were tailing
her a couple of weeks.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.297
What if whoever grabbed her

12:46.332 --> 12:47.999
was watching her
at the same time you were?

12:48.034 --> 12:50.001
I wish I could tell
you something useful,

12:50.036 --> 12:51.669
but the lady was
like clockwork.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.238
Every morning
she hit the gym,

12:54.273 --> 12:56.240
same time, same
coffee shop.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.775
Okay, okay.
Think of tiny details.

12:57.810 --> 13:00.778
I mean, it could be a little bit
of minutiae in there.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.981
Something out of the ordinary.
Can you think of anything?

13:05.217 --> 13:07.051
Is that a thought
or just... that's how you look?

13:07.086 --> 13:10.788
It's probably nothing.
A couple of days ago,

13:10.823 --> 13:13.090
Celine was having lunch
with another woman.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.092
The conversation
got a little heated.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.061
I mean, I didn't think
much of it at the time.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.796
I just figured it was
a couple of friends

13:18.831 --> 13:20.031
going back and forth.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.066
You know who
this woman was?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.034
I have no idea.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.403
Didn't seem relevant
to my case at the time,

13:25.438 --> 13:28.139
so I didn't ID her. All right,
how about a description?

13:28.174 --> 13:30.174
I can do better than that.
I got a picture of her.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.143
A picture? You got it on you?
- Yeah.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.447
What is this, Harry?

13:37.716 --> 13:39.517
Old school.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.189
I got to tell you
it's quite the buzz

13:45.224 --> 13:48.059
to meet another fan
of analog tech, mm-hmm.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.760
So what do
you shoot on?

13:49.795 --> 13:53.464
Pentax, Nikon,
Hasselblad, Canon?

13:53.499 --> 13:56.734
What do you got, some kind
of weird license plate fetish?

13:56.769 --> 13:59.136
Oh, no, I just keep a record
of all the cars

13:59.171 --> 14:00.638
that park outside
my house.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.707
Naturally.
And you are, again...

14:03.742 --> 14:06.444
Jerry.
Jerry Ortega.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.711
Five-O special consultant.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.847
You on medication,
Jerry?

14:09.882 --> 14:11.449
No. Why?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.317
No reason.

14:15.387 --> 14:19.623
Yeah, I mean, these days
with high-res camera phones

14:19.658 --> 14:20.858
and all the filters,

14:20.893 --> 14:22.793
everyone's a
photographer, right?

14:22.828 --> 14:24.395
It's cool that you still
do it the old-school way.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.164
You know, with f-stops
and ISOs.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.833
I mean, it's not just
an aesthetic choice for me.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.868
These days, you can't
be too careful.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.170
I mean, digital
files can be hacked

14:33.205 --> 14:35.139
and manipulated
and shared.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.575
You know that, and that's
why you work on film.

14:37.610 --> 14:42.179
You know, to keep all the
sensitive P.I. information safe.

14:42.214 --> 14:46.183
(chuckles) Well, I hate to pop
your balloon, cuddles,

14:46.218 --> 14:48.719
but if I could work out what
all those little buttons do,

14:48.754 --> 14:50.855
I'd switch to digital
in a heartbeat.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.624
You've got to be insane,
or very, very single

14:53.659 --> 14:55.159
to want to spend this much time

14:55.194 --> 14:59.630
in a small, dark room
inhaling these fumes.

15:01.667 --> 15:02.666
Right.

15:02.701 --> 15:05.169
HARRY:
There she is.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.405
Good job, Jerrymundo.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.775
STRATHAM:
Her name is Natasha Baron.

15:11.810 --> 15:15.179
She's, uh...
she's an old friend of Celine's.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.649
You, uh, you
seem surprised.

15:18.684 --> 15:19.850
I am, I am.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.785
As far as I knew,
they had some kind

15:21.820 --> 15:22.786
of falling-out a while ago.

15:22.821 --> 15:25.890
I didn't even know
they were still in touch.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.158
What happened between them?

15:27.193 --> 15:28.759
I have no idea.

15:28.794 --> 15:33.531
So, what, you think Natasha is
involved in this somehow, or...

15:33.566 --> 15:36.233
Well, you know, they had
a heated argument, and then,

15:36.268 --> 15:37.935
48 hours later, your
wife ends up kidnapped.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.570
All right, it makes Natasha
somebody that we need to

15:39.605 --> 15:41.238
go and talk to right now.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.907
So, hopefully, I'll have some
answers for you soon, Tom.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.543
CHIN:
<i>So Natasha Baron</i>

15:45.578 --> 15:47.545
is a freelance
graphic designer

15:47.580 --> 15:48.946
She runs her business
out of her home,

15:48.981 --> 15:50.915
and according to the U.S.
Census, she lives alone.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.284
I'm gonna upload her address
to your GPS now.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.286
Thank you.
- (beeps)

15:58.224 --> 16:01.492
Why are you pouting?

16:01.527 --> 16:03.260
What's wrong?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.728
Nothing.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.430
No, no, not--
not that.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.865
You have got the face--

16:07.900 --> 16:09.600
staring out the window
thinking about things

16:09.635 --> 16:13.204
you don't want to talk
about face on today.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.906
I can't, uh, adjust my face,

16:15.941 --> 16:17.274
'cause this is
the only face I got.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.776
HARRY:
Well, it makes sense to me.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.545
I mean, if he had any choice
in regard to faces,

16:21.580 --> 16:22.780
why would he go with this one?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.915
That's pretty good.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.317
Just tell me what's wrong.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.918
Okay,

16:27.953 --> 16:30.254
I, uh... I spoke
to Rachel this morning.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.922
Who's Rachel?
His ex-wife. And?

16:31.957 --> 16:33.891
You know, come to think of it,
I don't...

16:33.926 --> 16:35.459
we don't need
to discuss this now

16:35.494 --> 16:36.727
in front of, uh...

16:36.762 --> 16:37.761
What, you mean me?

16:37.796 --> 16:39.263
Yeah, you.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.498
HARRY:
Listen to me, muscles.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.601
I gave my name
to three different women,

16:43.636 --> 16:46.270
only to have it
thrown back in my face.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.005
So if anybody can
give you good advice

16:48.040 --> 16:51.308
in the world of ex-wives,
it's me.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.845
Well, uh, Rachel and Stan
are gonna get a divorce.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.447
What?

16:56.482 --> 16:57.982
Stan and Rachel, they're...
they're finished?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.383
Mm-hmm.
- HARRY: Now, wait a second.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.318
I'm a little confused here.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.921
You're upset because your
ex-wife is getting a divorce

17:03.956 --> 17:04.989
from another guy?

17:05.024 --> 17:05.956
What's the big deal?

17:05.991 --> 17:08.025
Well...

17:08.060 --> 17:10.828
(chuckling):
Oh, I get it.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.897
You and the former Mrs. Do are
thinking of having another go.

17:13.932 --> 17:15.032
No.
No.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.333
Then why the sad face?

17:16.368 --> 17:17.534
Well, I don't have
a sad face.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.836
I have a concerned face.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.272
The reason I have
a concerned face is because

17:21.307 --> 17:23.407
this guy, uh, has been

17:23.442 --> 17:24.975
like a second father
to my children.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.777
HARRY: They got kids.
There's... there's a unit,

17:26.812 --> 17:28.579
a family unit
they got going over there,

17:28.614 --> 17:29.780
and I don't think
it's a good idea

17:29.815 --> 17:30.781
that it gets broken up.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.016
You want to hear
my two cents?

17:32.051 --> 17:32.950
No, I don't.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.419
Hey, what about therapy?
They try therapy?

17:35.454 --> 17:36.320
It worked for us.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.522
I don't know, it seemed
pretty definitive.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.857
He's the one who wants
the divorce, not her.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.924
Did you just say "us"?

17:40.959 --> 17:41.925
You know what you need to do?

17:41.960 --> 17:42.993
You need to call Stan.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.695
Man to man, talk to him.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.597
See if you can convince him
to give it another shot.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.466
Wait a second, you two lovebirds
have a therapist?

17:49.501 --> 17:50.601
Yeah, we got a therapist.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.436
That's a terrible idea.
I agree.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.305
What do you agree... Okay, you
got something better to offer,

17:54.340 --> 17:56.540
let's hear it.
No, we don't got to hear it.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.543
Well, the way I figure it,
in the end, life will go on.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.313
Because nothing stays the same.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.547
Which is gonna be pretty sad

18:03.582 --> 18:04.982
when the good times
stop rolling,

18:05.017 --> 18:07.351
but it's what gives us hope

18:07.386 --> 18:08.652
when we're in
the pit of despair.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.354
Just remember one thing,
hairdo.

18:10.389 --> 18:14.391
No matter what happens,
the sun will rise tomorrow,

18:14.426 --> 18:16.060
and you're gonna put your
pants on one leg at a time.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.629
That's good. Three...
three ex-wives, you said?

18:18.664 --> 18:20.464
Yeah.
- 'Cause it makes sense.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.072
(doorbell rings)

18:33.512 --> 18:36.113
(doorbell rings)

18:36.148 --> 18:38.549
(doorbell rings again)

18:38.584 --> 18:40.084
I'm coming.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.387
(doorbell rings)

18:43.422 --> 18:45.456
(screams)

18:51.897 --> 18:53.364
(screams)

18:58.504 --> 18:59.603
LUKELA: We got a neighbor
heard screams.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.038
Then a car speeding away.

19:04.777 --> 19:08.011
Obviously not a coincidence. They
must have kidnapped her, too.

19:08.046 --> 19:09.380
But why?

19:11.683 --> 19:13.951
Sure. Sure, boss,
I'll let him know.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.854
That was Commander McGarrett.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.956
Natasha Baron has been
abducted from her home.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.658
Oh, my God.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.994
It's likely connected to your
wife's kidnapping in some way.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.397
Do you have any idea why
they'd want to take her as well?

19:31.036 --> 19:31.935
Mr. Stratham?

19:31.970 --> 19:34.538
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.940
I... It's just, you know,
it's a lot to process.

19:36.975 --> 19:40.677
I, uh... I have
no idea.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.046
(phone vibrating)

19:43.582 --> 19:44.848
Is that them?

19:44.883 --> 19:49.052
No. No, no, it's... it's work.

19:49.087 --> 19:52.890
(computer chimes)

19:57.463 --> 19:59.163
Are you sure about that?

20:01.867 --> 20:05.436
Why are the kidnappers
sending you this photo?

20:05.471 --> 20:08.005
'Cause you're having
an affair with her, aren't you?

20:10.843 --> 20:12.610
Yes.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.847
Hi. - So, shortly
after we received

20:16.882 --> 20:17.848
the proof-of-life
photo of Natasha,

20:17.883 --> 20:19.717
this comes through.

20:21.820 --> 20:22.920
Nice guy. Wow.

20:22.955 --> 20:23.954
This keeps getting
better and better,

20:23.989 --> 20:25.856
doesn't it, Tom, huh?

20:25.891 --> 20:28.058
DANNY:
"Now will you pay?"

20:28.093 --> 20:29.193
You mean, like you
didn't before, or what?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.727
It means Tom's
been lying to us.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.463
Isn't that right, Tom?

20:32.498 --> 20:33.964
Let me take a crack at this.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.866
The first time
those kidnappers called you

20:35.901 --> 20:37.801
and said they had your wife,
they gave you

20:37.836 --> 20:40.037
a where and a when
for an exchange, didn't they?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.072
Didn't they, Tom?

20:42.107 --> 20:44.041
All right, I think
it's safe to assume

20:44.076 --> 20:46.910
that Tom's silence here
is confirming

20:46.945 --> 20:49.079
that he blew off
the first ransom drop.

20:49.114 --> 20:50.781
You degenerate.

20:50.816 --> 20:51.782
(grunts)

20:51.817 --> 20:53.817
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

20:53.852 --> 20:54.952
We don't do that.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.954
Not usually we don't.
You all right?

20:56.989 --> 20:59.890
This guy wants me
to look after his wife,

20:59.925 --> 21:01.124
and all the time,
he's the cheat.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.527
What happened? Was Celine onto
you, is that what happened?

21:03.562 --> 21:06.063
You were so desperate to find
out if she was having an affair,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.865
because if she was,
you could divorce her

21:07.900 --> 21:10.000
and avoid a payout--
isn't that right?

21:10.035 --> 21:12.202
Except I didn't find
anything, did I, Tom?

21:12.237 --> 21:13.971
You were about
out of luck,

21:14.006 --> 21:16.006
and then the gift
of all gifts happens.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.008
Somebody kidnaps Celine,

21:18.043 --> 21:20.010
and all your shady little
prayers are answered.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.845
DANNY:
Okay, I'm just curious.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.948
Were you hoping that
the kidnappers killed your wife,

21:24.983 --> 21:26.884
so you could be
with Natasha?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.752
You kidding me? Of course he
doesn't care about his wife,

21:28.787 --> 21:30.721
it was a shock
they grabbed his girl.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.022
No, I just want her back safely.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.590
What'd you say?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.659
You better pray
that we get

21:35.694 --> 21:37.895
both these women back safely,
or you're gonna be on trial

21:37.930 --> 21:39.930
for an accessory to murder.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.277
You make a noise,

21:53.312 --> 21:56.847
and we come down and we gag you.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.149
It's your choice.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.118
(panting)

22:02.888 --> 22:03.987
(door closes)

22:04.022 --> 22:06.290
Try not to panic.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.926
Just take deep breaths.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.194
(inhales)

22:11.229 --> 22:13.196
What am I doing here?

22:13.231 --> 22:15.332
What do they want with me?

22:15.367 --> 22:19.002
Well, what do we both
have in common?

22:19.037 --> 22:20.304
I told you the other day.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.773
There is nothing going on
between me and Tom.

22:22.808 --> 22:25.909
Well, then,
we could be in trouble.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.845
What do you mean?

22:30.782 --> 22:34.051
Tom wouldn't pay
my ransom, Natasha.

22:36.121 --> 22:40.223
They came in here,
and put a gun to my head.

22:40.258 --> 22:41.992
They were gonna kill me.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.728
So I told them,

22:44.763 --> 22:47.764
if that jackass
won't pay for his wife,

22:47.799 --> 22:50.067
maybe he will pay
for his girlfriend.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.603
Oh... Oh, my God.

22:52.638 --> 22:53.571
CELINE:
So I hope,

22:53.606 --> 22:57.307
for both of our sakes,
that you are lying,

22:57.342 --> 23:01.345
and that Tom cares a lot more
for you than he does for me.

23:06.084 --> 23:08.185
No. To me, that could be
any one of a dozen brands.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.320
Nope. See over there?

23:10.355 --> 23:14.024
Only Kona has that kind
of detail on the label.

23:14.059 --> 23:17.194
Well, clearly, I am in the
presence of a craft beer savant.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.663
STEVE: Hey, yo.
We got something?

23:19.698 --> 23:20.831
HARRY: Oh,
we sure do.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.033
Our man with the two first names

23:23.068 --> 23:24.868
done cracked
this puppy wide open.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.169
Actually, we took a closer look

23:26.204 --> 23:28.205
at the proof of life
photo of Natasha Baron.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.674
Take a look at this.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.943
Now, the logo on that bag there

23:32.978 --> 23:34.344
is from Rainbow Valley
Supermarket.

23:34.379 --> 23:35.646
There's only one on the island.

23:35.681 --> 23:36.713
Mm-hmm.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.148
And then there's this.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.217
According to our local
craft beer expert,

23:40.252 --> 23:41.318
that's a case of Kona.

23:41.353 --> 23:42.886
Big Wave Ale, to be exact.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.121
All right,
we know the timeframe

23:44.156 --> 23:45.656
when Natasha was kidnapped,

23:45.691 --> 23:48.258
so we just need to narrow down
the store's CCTV footage

23:48.293 --> 23:50.360
and find the guy who bought
a case of this beer.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.095
Right. Actually,
we already pulled

23:52.130 --> 23:54.064
the store's security camera
footage over the last 12 hours

23:54.099 --> 23:55.065
and we're processing
it right now.

23:55.100 --> 23:55.999
Okay. Great work.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.334
Uh, let me know
when you get something else.

23:57.369 --> 23:58.735
Okay.

23:58.770 --> 23:59.837
All right.

24:02.207 --> 24:02.973
What's up?

24:03.008 --> 24:04.408
Can you, um,
can you come in here

24:04.443 --> 24:05.776
for a second, please?

24:05.811 --> 24:06.843
Yeah.

24:06.878 --> 24:07.944
All right.

24:07.979 --> 24:09.413
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.116
Um, despite, uh,
the little voice in my head

24:13.151 --> 24:14.117
that is constantly telling me

24:14.152 --> 24:16.687
to never listen to you,
I ignored it, and I went

24:16.722 --> 24:18.955
and I called Stan.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.157
Didn't go well, huh?

24:20.192 --> 24:22.159
No, it did not go well.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.760
Didn't go well.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.861
Okay.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.930
Are you sure
that you did it right?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.098
I mean, I'm just...
Some-- occasionally,

24:28.133 --> 24:29.299
you can be a little...

24:29.334 --> 24:32.102
It wasn't the delivery.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.236
No? What'd he say?

24:33.271 --> 24:34.438
He said a lot
of things.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.840
He said that he is, um...

24:36.875 --> 24:39.710
he's leaving, and that he hung
in as long as he could,

24:39.745 --> 24:41.778
for the kids' sake--
which I appreciate,

24:41.813 --> 24:43.714
I give him credit for--
but he can't take it anymore,

24:43.749 --> 24:45.015
and, he is...he is
on a plane to Las Vegas.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.783
When?

24:46.818 --> 24:47.818
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

24:47.853 --> 24:48.852
Yeah.
- That's it?

24:48.887 --> 24:51.988
No. That is not it. Um...

24:52.023 --> 24:54.191
he, uh, he told me
that he thinks

24:54.226 --> 24:55.492
that Rachel's
still in love with me.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.227
HARRY:
Oh, boy.

24:57.262 --> 24:58.395
What?

24:58.430 --> 25:00.230
What-- this is
a private conversation.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.498
Rachel's still in...
Obviously.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.167
Hey, you got to admit,
I called this.

25:04.202 --> 25:06.269
When are you and the ex
gonna get back together?

25:06.304 --> 25:08.071
No, Harry, we're not gonna get
back together,

25:08.106 --> 25:09.806
uh, for a lot of reasons.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.074
Most important being
that I have a girlfriend

25:11.109 --> 25:12.075
that I like very much. Okay?

25:12.110 --> 25:15.045
I didn't hear the word "love,"
did you, Steve?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.180
Harry, you know what? You don't know
anything! Huh? Dude, this is crazy.

25:17.215 --> 25:20.150
Please. You don't know
the, the specifics

25:20.185 --> 25:22.519
and you're not,
you don't, just...

25:22.554 --> 25:24.087
butt out, please.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.757
Okay, w-what, okay,
so i-is... that's it.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.760
No, that was not it.

25:29.795 --> 25:32.429
Do you not think that Charlie
has a lot to do with this?

25:32.464 --> 25:35.265
Because he can't get over
something like that.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.234
Every time they get into a
discrepancy, that's gonna be...

25:37.269 --> 25:39.236
I mean, he can't forgive her
for that. Right?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.270
What's the deal with Charlie?

25:40.305 --> 25:41.271
Charl-- look.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.974
Danny, Danny
got Rachel pregnant

25:44.009 --> 25:45.509
when Rachel and Stan
were having a break, right?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.311
And Stan thought the kid
was his for the longest time

25:48.346 --> 25:50.981
and then Charlie got sick, he
needed a bone marrow transplant.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.849
Hey, he's fine, okay?

25:52.884 --> 25:54.384
Guess who the only
matching donor was, right?

25:54.419 --> 25:58.321
So the truth came out,
it got crazy. (sighs) Oh...

25:58.356 --> 26:00.190
Doesn't need to know
any of this.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.292
(knocking on door)
Hey. We got something.

26:02.327 --> 26:03.560
Thank God.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.095
CHIN:
<i>We found our mystery shopper.</i>

26:05.130 --> 26:07.297
Ran facial rec and got a hit.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.167
Meet Gary Fallon.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.536
Several priors, including
robbery and aggravated assault.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.372
Also pulled
the parking lot footage.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.040
Natasha's in the trunk.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.542
Ran the license plate,
and it came back

26:18.577 --> 26:20.477
to an address in Wahiawa.

26:20.512 --> 26:23.246
Live satellite images confirm

26:23.281 --> 26:25.415
that the car's currently parked
outside the property.

26:25.450 --> 26:27.517
Got to be where
they're holding the women.

26:27.552 --> 26:28.886
(sirens wailing)

26:36.628 --> 26:38.361
Thermal imagery
indicates four bodies inside.

26:38.396 --> 26:41.031
STEVE: Looks like
two hostages, two hostiles.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.299
Steve.

26:43.501 --> 26:45.135
Everybody look sharp,
We got somebody moving

26:45.170 --> 26:46.303
to the front door.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.879
(crying)

26:55.914 --> 26:58.081
Lou, get the bomb squad
out here, right now.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.817
Okay.

27:10.629 --> 27:14.364
Move-- everybody get back,
right now.

27:14.399 --> 27:16.867
We got more movement
inside the house.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.435
Chin.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.540
Celine, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.542
Celine, stop.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.477
Look at me.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.412
It's okay.

27:29.447 --> 27:30.981
Please, let them go
or they're going to kill me.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.085
Hold your fire.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.387
Back off. Nobody do
anything stupid.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.323
I got a shot.
- Negative.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.092
He's got a dead man switch.
We light him up,

27:42.127 --> 27:43.427
that bomb goes off,
everybody is dead.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.599
STEVE: Get those
cars out of here,

27:49.634 --> 27:51.468
let these vehicles through,
right now.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.270
Get those cars out of here.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.005
(tires screeching)

27:56.474 --> 27:58.041
Lou.
- Yeah.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.476
Get helos up,
track that vehicle.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.911
Got it. This is Captain...

28:00.946 --> 28:03.914
Celine, look at me.

28:03.949 --> 28:05.482
Look at me.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.417
Give me your hand.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.452
Celine, give me your hand.

28:09.487 --> 28:11.922
That's right, that's
right. Look at me.

28:11.957 --> 28:15.191
Okay. Breathe.

28:15.226 --> 28:16.660
(exhales)

28:16.695 --> 28:19.562
We got a bomb tech
coming out right now.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.932
We're gonna get this vest
off of you; look at me.

28:21.967 --> 28:24.434
I'm right here
with you, okay?

28:24.469 --> 28:26.503
We're gonna breathe together.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.205
Okay. You're doing great.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.241
(sniffles)

28:51.563 --> 28:53.530
All right, go, go. Go, go.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.673
Okay. You're okay.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.375
You're okay.

29:06.478 --> 29:09.179
You just went through
a hell of an ordeal,

29:09.214 --> 29:10.280
but this very time sensitive.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.615
Right now, I need to ask you
some questions, okay?

29:12.650 --> 29:13.549
Of course.

29:13.585 --> 29:17.053
We IDed this man
as one of the kidnappers.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.588
Do you recognize him?

29:18.623 --> 29:21.358
No. Um, they were wearing masks.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.059
I never saw their faces.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.627
Okay, were you able to hear
any of their conversations?

29:24.662 --> 29:26.062
Anything about an endgame,

29:26.097 --> 29:27.530
or how they were gonna
get off the island?

29:27.565 --> 29:28.731
No, no. Uh,
the only thing they said

29:28.766 --> 29:31.534
was that I was supposed to drive
to this abandoned factory,

29:31.569 --> 29:34.237
wearing the vest, and
that I was to wait for you guys

29:34.272 --> 29:35.639
to show up with the money.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.642
HPD's got a bird in the air,
but we lost visual.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.578
(exhales)

29:41.613 --> 29:43.646
Well, y-you have
to get her back.

29:43.681 --> 29:45.415
We're gonna do
everything in our power.

29:45.450 --> 29:49.119
You don't, um, understand.

29:49.154 --> 29:52.222
I was the one who told them
about Natasha.

29:55.393 --> 29:56.693
All right, listen, to me,

29:56.728 --> 29:58.495
Celine, I'm sure
you didn't have an option.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.096
You don't blame
yourself now, okay?

30:00.131 --> 30:01.698
Right.

30:01.733 --> 30:05.235
I'm not the only one
to blame here.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.370
CELINE: So now we know
what I am worth to you.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.706
STRATHAM: Celine, I am so sorry
for what I put you through,

30:09.741 --> 30:12.042
and for this thing
with Natasha, I...

30:12.077 --> 30:13.810
Save it.

30:13.845 --> 30:14.811
And just do the right thing.

30:14.846 --> 30:17.414
Because whatever else
Natasha has coming to her,

30:17.449 --> 30:19.516
she doesn't deserve to die just
because she made the mistake

30:19.551 --> 30:20.517
of getting involved with you.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.119
KONO: Blocked number,
this has got to be it.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.088
Remain calm. You keep
them on the line

30:25.123 --> 30:26.523
as long as you can, Tom,
all right?

30:26.558 --> 30:27.690
Stay calm.
- Yeah. Okay.

30:27.725 --> 30:29.259
All right.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.460
You ready?

30:32.530 --> 30:33.896
Hello?

30:33.932 --> 30:36.199
KIDNAPPER 2 (distorted): You're
testing our patience, Mr. Stratham.

30:36.234 --> 30:38.635
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Look, I-I had nothing to do

30:38.670 --> 30:40.703
with the, the police
showing up at that house.

30:40.738 --> 30:42.238
Look, I have the money...

30:42.273 --> 30:44.374
KIDNAPPER 2:
I talk. You listen.

30:44.409 --> 30:46.476
You have one shot at this.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.345
You screw it up,
and Natasha will die.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.647
<i>Put $1 million</i>
<i>in non-sequential,</i>

30:50.682 --> 30:53.083
<i>unmarked hundred dollar bills</i>

30:53.118 --> 30:54.250
<i>into a metal briefcase.</i>

30:54.285 --> 30:58.321
<i>A taxi will stop</i>
<i>outside your house.</i>

30:58.356 --> 30:59.589
<i>Get in.</i>

31:08.533 --> 31:10.166
CHIN:
The cab is heading east

31:10.201 --> 31:12.235
on Ala Wai Boulevard, Steve.

31:13.438 --> 31:14.771
STEVE (over radio):
<i>Copy that, Chin.</i>

31:14.806 --> 31:16.306
<i>We're on our way.</i>

31:17.775 --> 31:19.809
Where are we going?

31:19.844 --> 31:21.277
Hey.

31:21.312 --> 31:23.279
Can you hear me?

31:23.314 --> 31:25.615
They told me if I talked to
you, they'd hurt my family.

31:25.650 --> 31:26.750
Just let me get you
there, please.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.455
Still in visual contact.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.358
STEVE: Uh, I got a visual.
They're headed downtown.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.327
HPD and SWAT should be
standing by to deploy.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.163
Hold perimeter on my command.

31:40.198 --> 31:41.731
JERRY:
Roger that.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.533
Looks like the
taxi's slowing down.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.308
DANNY:
Stratham just went in

31:52.343 --> 31:54.177
an apartment building,
2524 Kamani Street.

31:54.212 --> 31:56.579
GROVER:
This is Captain Lou Grover.

31:56.614 --> 31:58.815
HPD and SWAT, I need you
in position right now.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.685
Set up one block perimeter.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.722
(sirens wailing)

32:10.562 --> 32:14.164
STEVE:
Got a visual.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.266
Guys, he's on the roof.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.834
I repeat, he's on the roof.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.639
There's, uh...

32:22.674 --> 32:24.207
there's no one here.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.878
Hello?

32:28.913 --> 32:30.480
KIDNAPPER 2:
Look down.

32:30.515 --> 32:31.948
At the base of the wall...

32:31.983 --> 32:34.818
you will see some binoculars,
pick them up.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.722
Across the street, corner unit,

32:39.757 --> 32:41.258
three floors down.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.396
TOM:
Okay, look, I-I got the money.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.698
Ju-Just don't hurt her,
all right?

32:48.733 --> 32:50.200
Just tell me what
you want me to do.

32:50.235 --> 32:51.635
Look over the wall.

32:58.776 --> 32:59.609
Yeah, I can see it,
I can see it.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.377
Place the metal clamp

33:01.412 --> 33:02.612
through the handle on the case,

33:02.647 --> 33:03.713
and release it.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.751
All right, team, listen up,

33:08.786 --> 33:11.754
our suspect is in a hotel room
across the street.

33:11.789 --> 33:13.456
Make that the 15th floor.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.657
Northwest
corner unit.

33:14.692 --> 33:15.792
Suspect is in a room,

33:15.827 --> 33:17.794
floor 15, in
a hotel room.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.629
Grover, Danny move in.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.364
Move on that room.
Move, move.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.602
What's he doing
with that bag?

33:28.673 --> 33:29.839
Whoa!

33:50.728 --> 33:53.330
STEVE: They're headed
inside with the case.

33:57.468 --> 33:58.768
We're good.

34:00.805 --> 34:02.405
Okay, you-you have your money.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.806
Now, just-just let her go.

34:03.841 --> 34:05.508
You really should've paid
the ransom the first time.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.377
Please! Please.

34:07.412 --> 34:08.645
Don't hurt her!

34:08.680 --> 34:09.746
Please! Please, don't hurt her!

34:10.882 --> 34:11.981
Steve,

34:12.017 --> 34:14.517
the gunman looks like he's
ready to pull the trigger.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.618
You got a shot?

34:15.653 --> 34:16.786
KONO:
Negative.

34:16.821 --> 34:17.988
Gonna bring it down, hold on.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.492
All right, Chin,
take the elevator, Chin,

34:22.527 --> 34:23.893
me and Grover will
take the steps.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.331
Taking fire, we're taking fire,

34:28.366 --> 34:29.599
we're taking fire.

34:30.768 --> 34:31.734
Okay. Hold position.

34:31.769 --> 34:33.736
Holding.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.305
Okay, take
your shot, Kono.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.572
(grunts)

34:36.607 --> 34:37.507
(screams)

34:39.877 --> 34:41.678
Gary? Gary?

34:49.620 --> 34:50.953
I lost visual
on the second kidnapper.

34:50.988 --> 34:52.722
He's in the building.
We've lost visual

34:52.757 --> 34:54.557
on the second suspect, guys.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.592
He's still in the building.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.566
Five-O!
Hold it...

35:09.574 --> 35:10.940
CHIN: Danny, suspect
is headed to you.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.043
Northeast corridor.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.102
All right, this is
Detective Danny Williams.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.738
I need SWAT to send a unit down
to the utility basement room.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.540
Our perp just went down
the... laundry chute,

35:44.575 --> 35:46.543
and I guess
I'm going in after him.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.452
Whoa!

35:56.487 --> 35:57.987
Oh! Whoa!

35:58.523 --> 35:59.456
(grunts)

36:00.958 --> 36:02.992
(Danny grunts)

36:10.802 --> 36:12.635
I'm beginning to think you guys
just have a phobia of hospitals.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.937
If you're gonna
staple his head, can I?

36:14.972 --> 36:15.938
No, no, ho, ho.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.440
Please, no staples.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.542
What the hell is Harry
doing back there?

36:19.577 --> 36:21.878
STEVE: Oh, yeah, it's a thing
he does, and he does this.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.046
And it says it helps him
think. I don't know.

36:24.081 --> 36:25.448
Well, I think better
with a cigar.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.483
Can I start smoking
in the office?

36:27.518 --> 36:29.085
Well, so we got an ID
on our missing perp.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.086
HPD recovered
a cell phone

36:30.121 --> 36:32.121
from the body
of Gary Fallon,

36:32.156 --> 36:33.289
our dead kidnapper.

36:33.324 --> 36:35.158
When they dumped the phone,
they found multiple messages

36:35.193 --> 36:37.560
from this guy.
Who is he?

36:37.595 --> 36:38.928
CHIN: He's our fugitive,
Colin Hanson.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.463
He's got a record for robbery,

36:40.498 --> 36:41.564
and he did time with Fallon.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.566
STEVE: Get this guy's photo
to all air and sea ports.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.001
Make sure he doesn't
leave the island.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.503
CHIN:
Copy.

36:59.784 --> 37:00.784
(doorbell rings)

37:05.523 --> 37:07.023
(screams)
No!

37:07.058 --> 37:08.658
Please don't!
(car engine starts)

37:08.693 --> 37:09.659
I-I have money!

37:09.694 --> 37:11.161
I have money!

37:13.998 --> 37:15.765
What the hell am I doing here?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.600
For starters,

37:17.635 --> 37:19.669
I wanted you to know what
it really feels like

37:19.704 --> 37:21.003
to be kidnapped.

37:21.038 --> 37:24.240
To be grabbed, and hooded,

37:24.275 --> 37:26.576
and thrown into
a trunk of a car.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.178
Was that scary, Celine?

37:29.213 --> 37:31.848
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.015
HARRY: You see, there was
something about the way

37:33.050 --> 37:35.818
that you were abducted
that gnawed at me.

37:35.853 --> 37:38.087
<i>When they put you in the car,</i>

37:38.122 --> 37:39.589
<i>they put you in the back</i>

37:39.624 --> 37:40.723
<i>and you just cooperated,</i>

37:40.758 --> 37:42.925
<i>like a good little girl.</i>

37:42.960 --> 37:46.028
Now, Natasha, on the other hand,
when they grabbed her,

37:46.063 --> 37:47.897
she was struggling.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.966
<i>Fighting for her life.</i>
(Natasha screams)

37:50.001 --> 37:53.269
She put up the kind of commotion
that people take notice of.

37:53.304 --> 37:56.005
(Natasha screaming) <i>So they put her in
the trunk where nobody could see her.</i>

37:56.040 --> 37:58.975
<i>And then there were the</i>
<i>ligature marks on her wrist,</i>

37:59.010 --> 38:01.244
<i>put there by the kidnappers.</i>

38:01.279 --> 38:03.212
<i>See, they tied that rope</i>
<i>tight around her wrists</i>

38:03.247 --> 38:05.548
<i>so that she couldn't get away.</i>

38:05.583 --> 38:07.950
But you, Celine,

38:07.985 --> 38:11.120
they knew you weren't
gonna get away.

38:11.155 --> 38:13.789
They just had to make you look
like you were a victim.

38:13.824 --> 38:16.726
Do you have any idea
how crazy you sound right now?

38:16.761 --> 38:17.894
I got to be honest,

38:17.929 --> 38:20.563
I was skeptical at first, too.

38:20.598 --> 38:22.899
Then we got the report back

38:22.934 --> 38:24.734
<i>on that bomb vest you were</i>
<i>wearing, and it turned out</i>

38:24.769 --> 38:26.869
<i>one of trigger wires wasn't</i>
<i>even connected to the battery,</i>

38:26.904 --> 38:28.971
so that thing was never
gonna go off.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.273
And why go through
the trouble

38:30.308 --> 38:33.175
of having myself kidnapped?

38:33.210 --> 38:35.311
I already have the money.
I was married to it.

38:35.346 --> 38:37.046
Love, greed.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.148
Maybe both.

38:39.183 --> 38:40.850
You knew I was tailing you,

38:40.885 --> 38:43.152
that's why you acted
like a good girl.

38:43.187 --> 38:46.856
You made sure I only saw
what you wanted me to see.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.758
The kidnapping,
not the boyfriend.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.560
What boyfriend?

38:52.129 --> 38:54.197
Well, Colin Hanson.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.601
Well, if he's not your
boyfriend, he's pretty confused.

38:58.636 --> 39:00.836
(handcuffs click) <i>When we picked
him up about an hour ago,</i>

39:00.871 --> 39:02.672
<i>outside terminal three,</i>
<i>Honolulu International,</i>

39:02.707 --> 39:03.973
<i>he was waiting for you.</i>

39:04.008 --> 39:06.576
So we got
his phone.

39:06.611 --> 39:07.577
We found

39:07.612 --> 39:09.979
texts, voicemails,

39:10.014 --> 39:11.247
pictures of
the two of you.

39:11.282 --> 39:13.082
That is you, right?

39:14.652 --> 39:15.585
HARRY:
You knew

39:15.620 --> 39:18.054
that if Tom found out
about you and Colin,

39:18.089 --> 39:20.623
that would trigger the fidelity
clause in your prenup,

39:20.658 --> 39:21.924
and you'd end up with nothing.

39:21.959 --> 39:22.925
I gotta say,

39:22.960 --> 39:24.293
it was a, it was a smart plan.

39:24.328 --> 39:26.095
I mean, who would ever suspect

39:26.130 --> 39:28.097
the woman who was
also the victim?

39:28.132 --> 39:30.933
HARRY: The lying,
scumbag husband

39:30.968 --> 39:32.335
and the scheming,
cheating wife.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.138
How could this relationship
not work out?

39:36.307 --> 39:38.808
STEVE: Come on.
- (door buzzes open)

39:41.312 --> 39:43.212
(sighs)

39:43.247 --> 39:44.981
All right.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.050
I got to tell
you, buddy...

39:48.085 --> 39:49.218
that was well done.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.053
If you say so.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.888
What now?

39:52.923 --> 39:56.158
Ah, I'm getting too slow
for this, Steve.

39:56.193 --> 39:59.629
In my prime,
I would've seen all the angles.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.897
You were the one who did
see all the angles, all right?

40:01.932 --> 40:03.699
If it wasn't for you,
we'd still be trying

40:03.734 --> 40:05.001
to figure
this thing out.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.235
Now listen, relax, come with me,

40:06.270 --> 40:07.803
I'm gonna I buy you
a couple of beers,

40:07.838 --> 40:09.205
you can tell me some stories
about my old man.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.206
What do you say?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.808
I got a better idea.

40:12.843 --> 40:14.810
I got a poker game
to got to tonight.

40:14.845 --> 40:16.879
There's an empty seat
if you want in.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.014
Really?

40:18.049 --> 40:20.182
Bunch of old-timers
who knew John.

40:20.217 --> 40:23.686
That way you get to hear
the stories,

40:23.721 --> 40:25.655
and I get to take your money.

40:25.690 --> 40:29.158
Oh, you-- oh, you think
you're gonna take my money?

40:29.193 --> 40:32.261
Well, if you play anything
like your dad, I will.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.697
"Mr. All-In."

40:34.732 --> 40:37.066
"Mr. All-In," huh?

40:37.101 --> 40:39.802
(both chuckle)

40:45.142 --> 40:46.175
(knocking at door)

40:48.913 --> 40:49.879
Hey.

40:49.914 --> 40:52.314
What are you doing here?

40:52.349 --> 40:54.283
Can I come in?

40:54.318 --> 40:56.419
Yeah.
Yeah? Sure?

40:56.454 --> 40:57.654
(chuckles)

41:03.494 --> 41:05.027
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:05.062 --> 41:06.262
You, uh...

41:06.297 --> 41:07.930
Tell them?
No, not yet.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.799
I was...

41:09.834 --> 41:12.334
actually just working
myself up to it.

41:12.369 --> 41:13.369
Ah.

41:16.006 --> 41:17.407
Right. Thanks.

41:19.076 --> 41:21.711
I know that you spoke to Stan.

41:21.746 --> 41:24.313
I hope I didn't
cause any trouble.

41:24.348 --> 41:26.816
No, it was a nice thing to do.

41:29.053 --> 41:31.721
Didn't change anything,
but, uh...

41:31.756 --> 41:33.989
You can't change the way things
are with Stan and me.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.225
No, but I thought, uh, you know,

41:36.260 --> 41:37.326
give it a shot.

41:37.361 --> 41:39.161
Not that-- change anything.
You know what I mean.

41:39.196 --> 41:41.230
I just feel that I...

41:41.265 --> 41:43.366
contributed to the problem,
so...

41:44.401 --> 41:47.303
No, this is, um...

41:47.338 --> 41:49.338
it's not your fault, Danny.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.343
Anyway, uh, I was, uh,
I was at home,

41:54.378 --> 41:58.414
and I was, uh,
I was thinking about, uh...

41:58.449 --> 42:01.951
when you and I had to tell Grace
that we were splitting up.

42:01.986 --> 42:05.221
And I remember
it being, uh,

42:05.256 --> 42:07.990
pretty awful, uh...

42:08.025 --> 42:10.259
For me, it was about
the worst day of my life.

42:10.294 --> 42:11.927
And I don't want you to
go through that alone,

42:11.962 --> 42:14.196
so I am here for you,
if you want me to be here.

42:14.231 --> 42:15.197
I am here.

42:15.232 --> 42:16.198
I can leave, I can stay.

42:16.233 --> 42:20.369
I'd like to stay for you,
if that's what...

42:25.442 --> 42:26.408
Thank you.

42:26.443 --> 42:27.777
Yeah.

42:29.446 --> 42:30.446
