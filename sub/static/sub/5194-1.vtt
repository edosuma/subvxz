00:55.320 --> 00:56.740
Sometimes it scares me to think...

00:56.840 --> 00:59.420
where it's coming from, you know?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.260
Like...

01:01.360 --> 01:04.090
there's someone else
inside there, not me.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.980
Well...

01:09.080 --> 01:12.260
what if I...

01:12.360 --> 01:14.840
what if I lose it and never get it back?

01:17.920 --> 01:19.968
What would I do then?

01:26.680 --> 01:28.728
Take a listen to this again,
I want to...

01:29.840 --> 01:31.740
do something with it.

01:31.840 --> 01:36.084
Um... I've got... I think I've got it.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.771
The music part,
it worked out in my head, but...

01:40.640 --> 01:42.961
I don't know anything else
except that it should...

01:44.800 --> 01:47.540
it should sound like,
you know, a cry, but...

01:47.640 --> 01:50.340
in sort of a good way or something.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.900
I want these voices
at the end just to...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.764
sound...

02:18.600 --> 02:20.660
All right, Chuck, let's have it.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.331
I wish they all could be California...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.700
We don't want to take 16...

02:28.800 --> 02:31.610
Help me, help me, help me...

02:33.360 --> 02:35.860
Baby...

02:35.960 --> 02:37.291
There we go.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.166
I'm losing it.
I'm losing the whole record.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.005
That'd be great.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.250
Something's going to happen.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.260
All right, here we go.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.771
You're grass and I'm a power mower.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.940
If everybody had an ocean...

03:31.040 --> 03:33.820
Across the USA...

03:33.920 --> 03:37.020
Then everybody'd be surfin'...

03:37.120 --> 03:39.540
Like Californi-a...

03:39.640 --> 03:42.580
You see them wearing their baggies...

03:42.680 --> 03:45.580
Huarache sandals, too...

03:45.680 --> 03:48.780
A bushy, bushy blonde hairdo...

03:48.880 --> 03:51.420
Yeah, we all grew up
in Hawthorne, California.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.220
The brothers here,
Dennis, Brian, and Carl.

03:54.320 --> 03:54.900
Carl.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.340
They all live in the same house
and I grew up...

03:56.440 --> 03:58.300
a few blocks down.
Al... Al, where did you live?

03:58.400 --> 04:01.260
Well, it's been building up
inside of me...

04:01.360 --> 04:05.380
for, oh, I don't know how long...

04:05.480 --> 04:09.140
I don't know why, but I keep thinking...

04:09.240 --> 04:13.100
something's bound to go wrong...

04:13.200 --> 04:17.500
- Ooh
- But she looks in my eyes...

04:17.600 --> 04:20.500
and makes me realize...

04:20.600 --> 04:21.860
and she says...

04:21.959 --> 04:23.980
I have watched you...

04:24.080 --> 04:27.740
on the shore...

04:27.840 --> 04:34.460
standing by the ocean's roar...

04:34.560 --> 04:37.180
with a different melody,
It's the same chord progression...

04:37.280 --> 04:38.380
- with a spin-off.
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.260
So, my part in the chorus
against the band...

04:41.360 --> 04:44.820
alternates with the intro
backing the new melody.

04:44.920 --> 04:45.980
Just gets around.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.020
Gets around. Clever.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.900
Round, round, get around,
I get around...

04:50.000 --> 04:51.500
- I get around
- Yeah...

04:51.600 --> 04:53.260
Get around, 'round, 'round, 'round...

04:53.360 --> 04:55.580
- I get around...
- Okay, hold it!

04:55.680 --> 04:57.980
'Round, 'round, 'round, I get around

04:58.080 --> 04:59.820
Get around, 'round, 'round,
I get around...

04:59.920 --> 05:02.580
I'm a real cool head...

05:02.680 --> 05:06.420
- I'm making real good bread
- Get around, 'round, 'round...

05:06.520 --> 05:08.260
Well, you knew all along...

05:08.360 --> 05:10.180
that your dad was
getting wise to you now...

05:10.280 --> 05:12.740
You shouldn't have lied now,
you shouldn't have lied...

05:12.840 --> 05:14.500
And since he took your set of keys...

05:14.600 --> 05:16.540
you've been thinking that
your fun is all through now.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.860
You shouldn't have lied now,
you shouldn't have lied.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.660
But you can come along with me...

05:20.760 --> 05:22.500
'cause we've got
a lot of things to do now.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.540
You shouldn't have lied now,
you shouldn't have lied...

05:24.640 --> 05:27.020
And we'll have fun, fun, fun...

05:27.120 --> 05:28.860
now that Daddy took the T-bird away.

05:28.960 --> 05:36.020
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

05:38.120 --> 05:41.780
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

05:41.880 --> 05:44.167
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

05:44.280 --> 05:47.940
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

05:48.040 --> 05:50.281
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

06:19.920 --> 06:21.700
Excuse me.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.245
What?

06:23.360 --> 06:25.260
Oh.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.660
Hi, how are you?

06:26.760 --> 06:29.127
I'm fine, thanks. Are these your shoes?

06:29.240 --> 06:30.660
What? Yeah, yeah, they're my shoes.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.700
I didn't want to, you know,
mess up the car...

06:32.800 --> 06:34.140
because I jog.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.780
See, I jog on the beach and, um...

06:36.880 --> 06:39.660
I get sand in my shoes, you know?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.260
So...

06:41.360 --> 06:43.100
Well, that's very considerate.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.060
But I... you know,
I also get sand in my socks.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.980
I got holes in my socks,
so I did make a mess anyways.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.605
So, I'm sorry about that.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.420
What are you going to do?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.488
You're going to get sand in the car.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.860
It's no problem.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.340
Can I help you today?

06:57.440 --> 06:59.940
I'd like to buy a car.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.500
Cadillac, you know?

07:01.600 --> 07:03.180
Great.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.487
- You've come to the right place.
- Yeah.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.809
This is the Fleetwood.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.644
- Wow.
- My personal favorite.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.700
What do you think?

07:22.800 --> 07:24.211
I don't know.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.802
Well, take your time,
there's no pressure.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.606
Blue is a very calm color.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.940
Is this guy a friend of yours?
I feel like he's watching us.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.646
No, he's not my friend.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.580
He's my bodyguard.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.380
Come on.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.260
Something like that.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.260
It's a funny word, isn't it, bodyguard?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.044
- Uh...
- Bodyguard.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.760
- Are we on "Candid Camera"?
- No.

08:05.880 --> 08:09.487
No, no, no. I do need a car.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.571
Can we just sit in here for a minute?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.730
Sure.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.300
Well, the master lock feature works.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.900
We know that much.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.604
Hmm.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.482
My brother died.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.527
Oh. Oh, I'm...

08:49.720 --> 08:51.165
I'm so sorry.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.020
He drowned.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.060
A few years ago.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.764
Two.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.940
But I'm all...
broken up about it still, you know?

09:06.040 --> 09:08.486
I mean, he wasn't even 40 yet.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.060
That is... that's terrible.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.860
- So sad.
- Yeah.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.340
But I just don't get it.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.660
I think about it every day,
and I just don't get it.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.580
I guess it's better just
not to think about it, right?

09:21.680 --> 09:23.180
Just...

09:23.280 --> 09:25.220
force it out of your mind.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.688
Sure. Yeah, I can understand that.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.129
I'm not married anymore.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.329
Okay.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.722
Do you have a pen I could use?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.060
I guess I need
a little piece of paper, too.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.020
Uh, sure. Just, um...

10:05.120 --> 10:06.610
Thank you.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.848
Brian, come on out of the car.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.570
- I'm Brian.
- Melinda.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.329
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.300
- Come on, Brian.
- I want this car.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.980
-
- The Fleetwood?

10:24.080 --> 10:26.287
No, no, yeah, but I want this car. Okay?

10:28.280 --> 10:30.940
I want this car.
This one we're sitting in.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.660
- Oh, the floor model?
- Yes, it's your favorite, right?

10:34.760 --> 10:37.740
- You want...
- It's special. You understand?

10:37.840 --> 10:39.700
- Can I have it?
- Sure.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.723
- Okay.
- Yes.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.886
- What's happening, guys?
- Hi, Gene.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.980
- Hi, I'm Dr. Eugene Landy.
- Hi.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.020
How are you?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.860
I'm Brian's brother from another mother.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.940
- What's up?
- I want the blue Fleetwood, Gene.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.380
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.780
You sure you don't want a Maserati?

11:02.880 --> 11:04.860
- No offense.
- None taken.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.860
- No, that one.
- Really?

11:06.960 --> 11:09.220
- It's her favorite.
- Okay.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.900
Well, I'm going to expect
a deal here. You know?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.380
Something worth our while.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.051
Do you know who this man is?
Brian Wilson.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.530
Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.340
- You didn't mention that.
- Well, 'cause that stuff doesn't matter.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.980
That's ego stuff. You know?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.900
Are you kidding me?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.660
I love your music. I grew up on it.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.220
So, thank you.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.620
That makes me feel really good,
Melinda Ledbetter.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.300
Okay.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.860
- Melinda Ledbetter.
- Right? It's a nice name.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.220
Uh, why don't you get started
on the paperwork?

11:45.320 --> 11:47.580
- Okay?
- Will do.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.100
Great. And thank you again
for your help.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.645
Let's go, Brian.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.540
Come on, guy.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.900
I think it's a good choice.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.240
- You feel good about it?
- Yeah.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.620
- You sure?
- Yeah.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.960
Okay.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.642
What the hell was that about?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.803
I'm not really sure.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.050
You okay?

12:14.960 --> 12:18.248
Yeah.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're about to start our descent.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.580
Please return your seats
to an upright position...

12:43.680 --> 12:45.489
and fasten your seat belts.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.880
You okay?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.445
I think I'm having a heart attack.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.485
Brian! Brian!

13:23.640 --> 13:25.180
- Brian! Brian! Brian!
- Get him something!

13:25.280 --> 13:26.500
- Bring us a pillow!
- Breathe!

13:26.600 --> 13:27.860
- Give me the pillow!
- Where's the pillow?!

13:27.960 --> 13:30.042
Give me the pillow!

13:30.160 --> 13:31.220
- Brian! Brian!
- Breathe!

13:31.320 --> 13:32.820
Are you choking? Are you choking?

13:32.920 --> 13:34.500
- I don't want to die!
- Hey!

13:34.600 --> 13:36.060
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I don't want to die!

13:36.160 --> 13:38.540
Brian, look at me.
Look at me! Look at me!

13:38.640 --> 13:40.580
Look at me! Look at me. Look at me.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.250
It's okay.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.940
Hi.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.849
You good?

13:48.920 --> 13:51.740
Nowhere to run to, baby.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.100
It was weird.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.780
It was like I was in a movie
or something.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.100
There was music, like always...

13:57.200 --> 13:59.580
but then it got dark and scary.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.860
I couldn't breathe.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.860
Like someone was holding
his hand over my mouth.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.620
Hey, Brian. You doing okay, baby?

14:06.720 --> 14:08.860
Yeah, I'm good, Mare.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.361
Okay, just checking.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.740
Yeah, then I started hearing things.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.580
Strange things.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.300
- People talking.
- What, like voices?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.620
Like, uh...

14:21.720 --> 14:23.540
like voices in your head?

14:23.640 --> 14:25.130
No!

14:26.600 --> 14:30.180
Well, kind of. Yeah.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.020
Maybe I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

14:33.120 --> 14:34.451
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

14:34.560 --> 14:36.020
It was kind of scary.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.580
I think it's just Dad. You know?
Messing with your head.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.900
We're too big for him
to take the belt to us anymore...

14:42.000 --> 14:45.020
so he's got to use
his black magic shit or something.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.420
Ah, come on. It's not Dad.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.380
- Yeah...
- Something's off.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.500
It's being on the road.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.380
You know, being up there. It's freaky.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.900
I get nervous onstage, too, Bri.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.700
- I mean, we all probably do.
- No, but this is different.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.620
Anyway, you don't need me
standing up there...

14:59.720 --> 15:01.940
looking like a jerk.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.100
I'll be better back here at home.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.860
Making music.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.980
I just want to be home.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.380
I got all kinds of new ideas...

15:10.480 --> 15:12.060
new sounds...

15:12.160 --> 15:13.780
new harmonies...

15:13.880 --> 15:16.060
new instruments.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.446
You hear the new Beatles?

15:17.560 --> 15:19.660
- Yeah.
- The "Rubber Soul"? Yeah.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.420
I heard it was about
John Lennon having an affair.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.860
It's amazing!

15:23.960 --> 15:25.700
I mean, it works like a whole.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.020
It's like a whole album.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.940
Everything fits together, no fat.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.940
Like an album of folk songs,
but the sounds are really far out.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.220
- Lots of overdubbing.
- They stole our backing vocal.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.971
You know, we go,
La, la, la, la, la, la...

15:38.080 --> 15:39.700
And then they changed it to...

15:39.800 --> 15:42.140
De, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de...

15:42.240 --> 15:45.820
I thought it said,
"Tit, tit, tit, tits, titties."

15:45.920 --> 15:47.300
- No?
- Denny.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.340
We can't let them get ahead of us!

15:49.440 --> 15:50.540
J...

15:50.640 --> 15:52.420
I can take us further.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.980
If you let me
stay at home in the studio.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.481
It's what I need to do.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.620
And I promise, when you come back...

16:00.720 --> 16:04.406
I will have stuff for you
that will blow your minds.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.247
Bri!

16:08.360 --> 16:10.169
Fine, but you just keep
your head on straight.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.340
- Okay, Bri?
- I will!

16:11.440 --> 16:13.340
- Hey, Brian!
- I will.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.820
Straight as a die.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.580
Hey, straight as a what?

16:17.680 --> 16:18.820
What does that even mean?

16:18.920 --> 16:20.020
You're going to die in a straight line?

16:20.120 --> 16:21.780
I have no idea. I heard Dad use it once.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.660
Oh, never use it again.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.540
It's going to be strange
to be in Japan without you, brother.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.380
Yeah, who's going to fold
our clothes now?

16:30.480 --> 16:32.540
Bri!

16:32.640 --> 16:34.780
Carl, Dennis, come on,
guys, come sit with us.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.486
Okay, I'll be right over.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.442
Everybody in!

16:48.560 --> 16:50.340
One of these days,
you are going to break...

16:50.440 --> 16:53.340
your skull open
if you're not careful, Bri.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.860
I'm going to make the greatest album
ever made, Mare!

16:55.960 --> 16:57.860
I know you are, baby.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.660
I know you are.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.340
Ben, two more minutes, I'm almost ready.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.646
You can lock up.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.140
- This is Melinda.
- Friday night.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.900
- 6:00?
- Hello?

17:16.000 --> 17:19.819
- What? Wrong ear.
- Put it on the other ear.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.446
- Hello? Uh, hi.
- Jesus.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.859
Is this Mel... Melinda?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.700
Yes, this is Melinda.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.060
Melinda Ledbetter?

17:29.160 --> 17:31.460
Yes.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.380
Hi.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.180
It's Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.

17:36.280 --> 17:40.205
Hi, Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.529
Melinda!

17:45.520 --> 17:47.522
Melinda Ledbetter!

17:49.760 --> 17:51.728
Melinda Ledbetter!

17:54.600 --> 17:56.489
Melinda!

17:58.720 --> 18:00.131
Are you there?!

18:01.600 --> 18:05.002
Hi.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.884
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.100
- How are you?
- I'm great!

18:13.200 --> 18:16.090
- You look really great.
- Thank you.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.940
- You want to go?
- Oh, did you... yeah.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.371
I...

18:25.400 --> 18:27.846
- I forgot your apartment number.
- Ah. Well...

18:27.960 --> 18:29.380
It's a good thing
the loudspeaker worked.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.050
Yeah.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.100
Why does it feel like
the prom all of a sudden?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.850
I'm not sure.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.521
Thank you.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.780
- Hey, Melinda.
- Hi.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.360
- You look great.
- Uh, hi!

18:56.440 --> 19:00.980
Gazing at people...

19:01.080 --> 19:03.380
- This song is so great.
- Some hand in hand...

19:03.480 --> 19:04.970
I love it.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.700
Such a beautiful song.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.500
- What's that?
- Excuse me?

19:08.600 --> 19:09.780
I couldn't hear what you said.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.620
What'd you say to Brian?

19:11.720 --> 19:13.900
Uh, I... I just said
that this song is...

19:14.000 --> 19:15.340
is so great. I love it.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.260
- Why? Why?
- No, it's a great song.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.940
It's fantastic. You're right. Timeless.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.203
Thoughts they cannot defend...

19:26.600 --> 19:31.288
Just what you want to be...

19:39.480 --> 19:41.403
Well...

19:43.080 --> 19:45.128
I guess this is good night.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.531
Good night.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.326
- Okay.
- Would you like me to call you again?

19:59.560 --> 20:01.340
Would you like to call me again?

20:01.440 --> 20:04.808
Or... are you just asking
'cause you were told to?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.202
Both things.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.700
- Both.
- I really appreciate your honesty.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.849
I really do. I don't meet
a lot of honest people anymore.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.780
I'll tell you what.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.043
I'm going to be home
most of the day Sunday.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.860
Give me a call if you feel like it.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.180
If you don't, that's fine, too.
There's no pressure.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.691
I'm going to call you.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.169
- Cool.
- Cool.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.805
Good night.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.291
Good night.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.571
I may not always love you...

21:12.320 --> 21:17.008
but long as there are stars above you...

21:18.680 --> 21:23.049
you never need to doubt it.

21:24.240 --> 21:29.041
I'll make you so sure about it.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.140
And God only knows...

21:32.240 --> 21:35.961
what I'd be without you.

21:40.840 --> 21:45.980
If you should ever leave me...

21:46.080 --> 21:51.300
well, life would still go on,
believe me.

21:51.400 --> 21:56.340
The world could show nothing to me...

21:56.440 --> 22:01.731
so what good would living do me?...

22:01.840 --> 22:03.683
And God only knows...

22:03.800 --> 22:07.407
what I'd be without you.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.700
And God only knows...

22:13.800 --> 22:18.442
what I'd be without you.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.380
And the last verse
repeats one more time...

22:24.480 --> 22:27.006
and the chorus will harmonize
over and over at the end.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.740
It's still rough, I know,
but it's getting there.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.900
It's right for Carl's voice.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.820
You like it, Dad?

22:34.920 --> 22:37.100
I mean, it'll get better.
The vocals will...

22:37.200 --> 22:39.540
counterpoint the backing track.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.165
Real soulful.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.609
Oh, you don't want
my advice or my meddling.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.060
Well, just tell me what you think.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.580
Not much use for me, is there?

22:52.680 --> 22:54.260
With your mom living on her own.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.011
Come on, we're still a family.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.780
Families don't fire their own father.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.660
I don't want to start
that argument again.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.820
- I'm not arguing.
- If I say something now, you'll argue.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.763
Then don't say anything.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.260
Forget it!

23:11.360 --> 23:13.860
Forget what? Forget what?

23:13.960 --> 23:16.420
- You don't like the song.
- I never said that.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.126
I can tell.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.300
Just say something!

23:22.400 --> 23:24.420
I would change the title.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.460
The Capris had a tune out
called "God Only Knows"...

23:27.560 --> 23:30.980
- in '55, '54.
- Never mind that.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.100
Did you close your eyes
like I asked you to?

23:33.200 --> 23:35.260
Tony and I think...

23:35.360 --> 23:38.409
if you close your eyes,
you can see a place...

23:38.520 --> 23:41.100
where something is happening.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.660
It's like being blind, but because
you're blind, you can see more.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.780
Don't you think
it's a spiritual kind of thing?

23:45.880 --> 23:49.168
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.124
I closed my eyes, didn't see a thing.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.740
I don't know,
maybe it could be something...

23:56.840 --> 23:58.500
with the right arrangement.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.260
Well, yeah, I have French horns on it...

24:00.360 --> 24:03.060
and flutes, tambourines,
sleigh bells, piano, bass...

24:03.160 --> 24:05.003
real complex key shifts.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.780
Frankly, if you really want to know...

24:08.880 --> 24:10.540
I don't care for it.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.220
It's too wishy-washy.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.820
If you leave me, why leave me?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.820
Life will go on, why go on living?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.540
It's not like a Beach Boys song.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.369
Your brothers are going to hate it.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.820
- It's a love song.
- It's a suicide note.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.180
Didn't you just say it could be something
with the right arrangement?!

24:27.280 --> 24:30.740
Well, I gave it another thought, okay?

24:30.840 --> 24:32.660
And if you can't keep
your voice down in my house...

24:32.760 --> 24:34.091
get out!

24:53.720 --> 24:55.180
Hey, Carol.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.380
- How's it going?
- Good. Good to see you.

24:57.480 --> 24:58.860
Groovy shades.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.689
Lyle, how's it going?

25:03.040 --> 25:05.460
- Hal, hey. Good to see you.
- Hey. You, too.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.780
I want you to meet Tony Asher.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.140
Tony Asher, this is Hal Blaine.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.300
The greatest drummer working today.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.860
And you never heard of him, have you?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.166
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

25:13.280 --> 25:16.300
That's the secret.
All these guys, Hal, Tommy, Carol, Earl...

25:16.400 --> 25:18.420
the whole band.
I mean, they're probably...

25:18.520 --> 25:21.420
the best in the business,
but they're studio musicians...

25:21.520 --> 25:23.700
so nobody's ever heard of them.
It's crazy!

25:23.800 --> 25:25.340
- Huh?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.329
Yeah. Here you go.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.286
Kettle drums?
Thought we were doing rock 'n' roll.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.340
Ah, a whole new bag.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.420
So what do we got going here, Brian?

25:37.520 --> 25:40.620
Uh, I don't know, Hal. Just some ideas.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.580
Try something.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.250
Oh, excuse me.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.860
- Bum, bum, bum.
- Yup.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.086
Yeah, let's try it.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.680
Mmm.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.528
That's exactly how I want it.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.841
You know what I'm going to do?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.260
Let's add a little tie right here.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.805
I think this will sound better...

26:08.920 --> 26:12.420
- a little smoother right there.
- You want to tie the first one?

26:12.520 --> 26:15.100
Okay, this is "I'm Waiting
For the Day," take six.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.921
Here we go. One, two, one, two, three.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.460
Oh, hey! That was out of sight.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.980
I mean, it really was, Al.
How did you play that?

26:48.080 --> 26:50.500
- I don't know.
- What?

26:50.600 --> 26:52.125
The, uh...

26:52.760 --> 26:54.125
How did you play that?

26:56.040 --> 26:58.500
- It was a mistake.
- Well, if you repeat a mistake...

26:58.600 --> 27:00.740
every four bars,
it's not a mistake anymore.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.460
- See what I mean?
- I love it.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.482
All right.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.968
That was great. Okay, let's do it again.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.260
Remember, it's the higher octave
on the upbeats and the bridge.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.580
Hey, Brian?

27:45.680 --> 27:47.020
- Yeah, I love that.
- Brian?

27:47.120 --> 27:49.700
- Yeah?
- I think you might've screwed up here.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.100
Really? Let me see.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.100
Well, you've got Lyle playing in D...

27:53.200 --> 27:56.060
- and the rest of us are in A major.
- Yeah, that's right.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.380
How does that work?
Two bass lines in two different keys?

27:59.480 --> 28:01.540
Well, it works in my head.

28:01.640 --> 28:02.860
It's all playing in my head.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.928
The orchestration
and the five vocal parts.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.420
I think it's going to work.
Let's try it.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.780
Oh, Hal? Hal?

28:10.880 --> 28:12.769
Here's how I want you
to do it. It goes, uh...

28:19.120 --> 28:20.300
Two, three, four.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.540
So it's, uh...

28:22.640 --> 28:24.420
the first beat
on the last bar of the intro.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.522
Boom! Two, three, four.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.580
There's the North Star right there.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.740
- That's the North Star?
- Yeah, yeah. You knew that.

28:43.840 --> 28:47.100
- I really didn't.
- Come on.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.060
- I mean, it's a bright star.
- Have you ever...

28:49.160 --> 28:50.460
have you ever seen this before?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.289
- Never like this.
- Yeah.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.900
I used to love
coming here as a kid, you know?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.260
I love the feel of this place.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.140
I really wanted to take you here.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.083
- You did?
- Yeah.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.180
Demonstration booths.
Do you remember those?

29:13.280 --> 29:16.284
- In the department store?
- Yeah, and that's when I first heard...

29:16.400 --> 29:18.140
The Four Freshmen...

29:18.240 --> 29:21.005
and immediately my mind just...

29:22.200 --> 29:23.660
I mean, it's... like magic.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.420
Something happened and...

29:25.520 --> 29:28.620
so I listened to those harmonies
and study them after school,

29:28.720 --> 29:31.380
and I would teach them to my brothers.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.140
And we'd all sing.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.700
And then I would teach them
to my parents...

29:34.800 --> 29:36.060
and we'd all be sitting around singing.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.811
My brothers and my parents
and everybody.

29:38.920 --> 29:39.980
Everybody.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.940
Wow. That sounds like
such a wonderful childhood.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.644
Yeah, it was really nice...

29:44.760 --> 29:46.980
except for when my dad
was beating on us...

29:47.080 --> 29:49.180
all the time, you know? Like...

29:49.280 --> 29:53.140
He was a really hard, hard guy.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.049
You know, like, um...

29:56.760 --> 29:59.780
There's a spanking. You know that sound?

29:59.880 --> 30:01.380
You know a certain kind of spanking...

30:01.480 --> 30:03.084
and it sounds like a...
you know, like...

30:05.440 --> 30:07.260
But the way we had it, you know?

30:07.360 --> 30:09.820
When it came out of him, it's...

30:09.920 --> 30:13.380
You know?

30:13.480 --> 30:14.925
Really hard.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.340
Come on, let's give
these guys some privacy.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.060
- You know, we laugh about it.
- Babe, I can't just...

30:19.160 --> 30:20.900
- Doug, come on.
- You know, back in those days?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.180
We laugh about all that, but...

30:23.280 --> 30:26.329
it was pretty tough business.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.731
Pretty tough business.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.220
Hey.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.020
- I'm so sorry.
- No, what? About what?

30:35.120 --> 30:37.180
They're okay.
They come here all the time.

30:37.280 --> 30:40.740
- It's their favorite spot.
- No, Brian, about your dad.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.808
Oh, yeah.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.540
You know, spare... spare the rod...

30:45.640 --> 30:47.324
spoil the child.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.700
You know I'm 96% deaf...

30:50.800 --> 30:53.963
in my right ear because
my dad whacked me all the time?

30:54.960 --> 30:56.820
He was a really hard man...

30:56.920 --> 30:59.020
and he was a not very happy man...

30:59.120 --> 31:01.100
but, uh...

31:01.200 --> 31:03.500
in some ways I love my dad,
you know, because...

31:03.600 --> 31:05.220
he scared me and he scared me so much...

31:05.320 --> 31:07.740
I think he actually scared me
into making good records.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.220
You know? I mean, he had this, like...

31:09.320 --> 31:12.820
competitive spirit
that really blew my mind and...

31:12.920 --> 31:14.763
What about your mom?

31:16.840 --> 31:18.900
She stayed out of all of it, mostly.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.980
I think she drank a lot. You know?

31:22.080 --> 31:24.526
That's how she...
she... she dealt with it.

31:26.520 --> 31:30.820
I haven't seen her in... three years?

31:30.920 --> 31:33.260
- What?
- Gene doesn't think it's a good idea...

31:33.360 --> 31:35.328
for me to be in touch
with my family right now.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.060
I haven't seen my daughters in...

31:39.160 --> 31:40.810
two years.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.900
You have two daughters.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.129
Yeah. Yeah.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.260
I wasn't a very good father
to them, you know?

31:53.360 --> 31:56.940
Because I was drinking and drugging
when I should have been...

31:57.040 --> 31:58.780
you know, a parent.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.460
And, uh...

32:01.560 --> 32:03.660
you know, I made a mess of my life...

32:03.760 --> 32:05.900
lost control of my life.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.740
It's a weird trip...

32:07.840 --> 32:09.780
but...

32:09.880 --> 32:12.406
anyway, they live in Encino
with their mom.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.860
Well, shit.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.564
Yeah.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.660
But it's not so bad now anymore.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.220
You know?

32:25.320 --> 32:27.641
- Good.
- Uh-huh.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.526
Good.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.940
Look, listen to me,
I'm just going on and on.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.780
- It's my boring life...
- It's not boring.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.580
It is, but what about you, Melinda?

32:40.680 --> 32:43.660
I mean, my God, you're so...

32:43.760 --> 32:47.460
You're such good fun
and you're... you're so...

32:47.560 --> 32:49.820
so tender and so sweet.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.081
I mean...

32:52.360 --> 32:54.966
why don't you have a... boyfriend?

32:58.080 --> 33:00.686
Oh, well...

33:02.440 --> 33:04.124
There was someone.

33:05.960 --> 33:09.282
He was no good. He broke my heart.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.380
He shouldn't have done that.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.801
Well, I shouldn't have let him.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.660
Aww, sh...

33:25.760 --> 33:27.540
Fuck. Tony, you holding those keys down?

33:27.640 --> 33:28.740
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.320
Can I have another
bobby pin, please, Hal?

33:33.760 --> 33:35.540
Okay, keep the keys down, Tony.

33:35.640 --> 33:36.721
Here we go.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.180
Yeah, so, uh, right here.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.700
No, give it, uh...

34:03.800 --> 34:05.220
like...

34:05.320 --> 34:06.560
There's like a gasp in between.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.540
Cut! I think we got it.

34:15.639 --> 34:18.380
Chuck, mix that in, uh,
with the sound of the train...

34:18.480 --> 34:19.900
going by at the end of "Caroline, No."

34:20.000 --> 34:21.860
- You got it, Brian.
- Hey, Chuck...

34:21.960 --> 34:24.565
you think we could get a horse in here?

35:17.480 --> 35:19.005
Hey, kid.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.380
Brian.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.300
Brian!

35:24.400 --> 35:26.820
Brian! You got a light?

35:26.920 --> 35:29.571
I spilled coffee on my matches in there.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.380
Tough day at the office?

35:45.480 --> 35:47.820
Well...

35:47.920 --> 35:50.300
my family is coming in tomorrow...

35:50.400 --> 35:53.180
the band, they're...

35:53.280 --> 35:55.965
Well, sometimes they're tough, you know?

36:07.560 --> 36:09.244
Let me tell you something.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.860
We're all pros, you know?

36:13.960 --> 36:16.900
We've played with everyone.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.700
Heard it all.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.220
You name them, we've played with them.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.380
Sinatra, Dean Martin...

36:24.480 --> 36:27.460
Elvis, Phil Spector...

36:27.560 --> 36:31.380
Sam Cooke, everyone!

36:31.480 --> 36:34.404
And we all studied in goddamn
conservatories, for Christ's sake.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.380
But...

36:40.480 --> 36:43.180
but you...

36:43.280 --> 36:46.620
you got to know...

36:46.720 --> 36:48.245
that you're touched, kid.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.682
You've blown our minds.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.805
- More than Phil Spector?
- Ah, Phil's got nothing on you.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.820
Oh, man.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.500
No, the band is going to love it.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.250
Every note of it.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.844
You're a talented young man.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.167
Hang in there, man. I'll see ya.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.128
- I'll see ya tomorrow, Hal.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.740
- Wow, nice place.
- Yeah, come on in.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.171
Let me show you around.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.780
- Oh, wow.
- This is my room.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.325
This is my room.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.700
- Oh, nice!
- Yeah, I got to pick it.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.900
What do you mean?

37:57.000 --> 38:00.980
Well, you know, I got another house
a little bit up the coast, you know?

38:01.080 --> 38:03.020
- You do?
- But Gene wants me to live, you know...

38:03.120 --> 38:04.500
in a more controlled environment.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.140
So he's living in that one
and I'm living here.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.700
You know, not so many
distractions and memories.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.580
But I got to pick the room.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.125
- Wow.
- Ch... ch... check this out.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.244
Look at this.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.260
That's absolutely beautiful.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.860
Thanks.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.460
What is it?

39:01.560 --> 39:03.020
Oh, that's just something that I...

39:03.120 --> 39:04.963
came up with when I saw you.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.020
What are you going to do with it?

39:09.120 --> 39:11.340
Nothing, it's gone.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.044
That was just for you.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.620
That's so incredible. Oh, my God...

39:19.720 --> 39:21.660
that just, like, came out of you.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.900
Is that how it works? Or just...

39:24.000 --> 39:26.002
Yeah. Sometimes.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.780
Sometimes your inner voice
wants to express itself...

39:31.880 --> 39:33.740
and every once in a while,
every blue moon...

39:33.840 --> 39:36.220
your soul... comes out to play.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.700
- You know?
- Wow.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.700
Can't be rushed.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.700
It's like a kid, it's just nature...

39:41.800 --> 39:44.121
but... yeah.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.420
Can I ask you something personal?

39:51.520 --> 39:55.180
- Personal?
- Kind of.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.203
Sure, I'm an open book.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.450
Did you really spend two years in bed?

40:03.680 --> 40:05.540
No...

40:05.640 --> 40:07.290
more like three.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.409
At least, that's what I tell people.

40:14.360 --> 40:18.001
I got out at night
sometimes in my bathrobe.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.082
Do you like matzo ball soup?

40:25.880 --> 40:28.060
I don't know. I don't think...

40:28.160 --> 40:31.340
- I've ever had matzo ball soup.
- No?

40:31.440 --> 40:33.408
It's really good.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.540
My ex-wife was Jewish,
did I tell you that?

40:37.640 --> 40:39.180
- No.
- That's when I first had it.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.140
- Oh.
- At Marilyn's parents' house.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.890
They're really nice parents.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.540
She saved my life.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.580
Marilyn?

40:48.680 --> 40:49.820
Mare.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.380
I wasn't a very good husband,
I told you...

40:52.480 --> 40:54.420
but...

40:54.520 --> 40:56.568
we were only kids when we got married.

40:56.680 --> 40:59.809
- She was 16. 16.
- That's crazy.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.780
I think it's
an acquired taste, you know?

41:04.880 --> 41:08.123
- Marriage?
- Matzo ball soup.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.340
We should go one day, you know?

41:12.440 --> 41:13.780
- Go to Canter's and try it.
- Sure.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.180
- Do you want to try it?
- Yeah, I would. Why not?

41:16.280 --> 41:18.420
- I don't want to force you to.
- You wouldn't be.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.820
- It's not going to kill you or anything.
- I would hope not.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.540
You know, I mean,
just have a little bit.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.180
- It's good to try new things in life.
- Okay. I will.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.060
I will try to keep an open mind.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.180
- It's important to try things.
- Good.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.500
- New things.
- New things.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.522
I agree.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.180
Brian...

41:35.280 --> 41:36.850
time for your pills.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.330
Come on.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.329
- One minute.
- Oh.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.420
Melinda...

41:51.520 --> 41:53.700
you ever hear of the, um...

41:53.800 --> 41:56.300
"Underground Dictionary"?
Thank you, sweetheart.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.900
- Uh, no.
- Well, I published it.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.500
- 1971.
- Huh.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.220
It's an amazing book. It's a, uh...

42:03.320 --> 42:05.100
lexicon for subcultural speak.

42:05.200 --> 42:08.860
It's a reference book
for professionals...

42:08.960 --> 42:11.645
of all kinds to learn how to talk to...

42:13.200 --> 42:15.140
the subcultures of the time.

42:15.240 --> 42:18.940
- Bikers, hookers, surfers...
- Hey.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.580
- Are you okay?
- ...junkies, blacks...

42:20.680 --> 42:24.060
- Yeah.
- What does he have you on?

42:24.160 --> 42:27.500
I get allergies.
I get allergies, so, um...

42:27.600 --> 42:28.540
I get a little drowsy.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.290
They're the toughest ones to talk to.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.209
Right, Brian?

42:33.680 --> 42:36.260
I'm... I'm... I'm hungry, Gene.

42:36.360 --> 42:39.660
- ...It was a real bitchin' concept book.
- Gene, I'm hungry.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.900
Kind of ahead of its time
and it got a lot of attention.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.460
- Frankly.
- Gene, I'm hungry.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.100
It's coming.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.260
Uh, far out, right on, out of sight...

42:48.360 --> 42:50.442
uh, smokey tits, bonnaroo.

42:51.680 --> 42:54.900
Uh, super wicked, wiggy.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.100
How about that? All right.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.168
We got one ready here.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.340
Guest of honor first.

43:03.440 --> 43:04.580
- Oh.
- There you go, ma'am.

43:04.680 --> 43:07.300
- Nope.
- You know, I'm...

43:07.400 --> 43:09.620
- You... you should have it.
- No, no. He's not as hungry...

43:09.720 --> 43:11.529
- as he thinks he is.
- I'm... I'm hungry.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.580
No, you're not. You know what?

43:13.680 --> 43:15.460
You need to drink more water
and you would be full.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.166
- I think he's hungry.
- Go ahead. No, patience is a virtue.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.089
- Seriously, he can wait.
- I think he should...

43:20.200 --> 43:22.168
- I can share.
- Taste it.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.163
Good? Far out.

43:33.440 --> 43:34.771
Far out.

43:37.680 --> 43:38.980
- Hey, Gene.
- Yeah?

43:39.080 --> 43:41.700
Exactly what allergies
does he suffer from anyway?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.928
Don't you worry about that.

43:45.600 --> 43:48.540
Brian's medications
are very carefully administered...

43:48.640 --> 43:51.060
if you must know.

43:51.160 --> 43:54.340
You know what?
No, God damn it! Jesus Christ!

43:54.440 --> 43:56.660
Seriously?! Seriously?!

43:56.760 --> 44:00.460
You have got to learn
to wait your goddamn turn!

44:00.560 --> 44:03.180
Jesus Christ!

44:03.280 --> 44:05.220
Now this is what happens, okay?

44:05.320 --> 44:06.820
- I'm hungry.
- No!

44:06.920 --> 44:10.220
You are not goddamn hungry!
You think you're hungry!

44:10.320 --> 44:13.180
Do you you understand
the goddamn difference?!

44:13.280 --> 44:15.500
Wait your turn!

44:15.600 --> 44:17.602
You have got to be kidding me!

44:20.240 --> 44:23.140
You have no idea
the consequences from this.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.020
- Okay?
- No.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.488
No idea, man! Come on!

44:28.600 --> 44:30.807
Jesus Christ! Rob?

44:48.320 --> 44:51.500
First of all, I want to apologize
about the other night.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.260
I can get worked up
sometimes when it comes to Brian.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.580
Now, I should have
met with you earlier...

44:57.680 --> 45:00.220
but with all of that said...

45:00.320 --> 45:02.180
I really don't want you to be alarmed...

45:02.280 --> 45:05.460
by what, uh, I'm going
to talk to you about now.

45:05.560 --> 45:08.660
But you should know
that you are dealing with...

45:08.760 --> 45:12.300
a very, very... sick man.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.420
There's no other way to say it. Sorry.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.860
Well, how sick is he?

45:16.960 --> 45:20.203
Brian is a... paranoid schizophrenic.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.900
But you really
do not need to be alarmed...

45:24.000 --> 45:25.420
because I have it under control.

45:25.520 --> 45:28.380
I am the control... so to speak.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.340
When I started working with Brian...

45:30.440 --> 45:33.220
he weighed, what... 300 pounds?

45:33.320 --> 45:35.580
He spent all day in bed...

45:35.680 --> 45:38.540
eating bloody steaks
and a lot of junk food.

45:38.640 --> 45:41.140
- Self-medicating.
- Oh.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.940
Drinking, among other things.

45:44.040 --> 45:47.660
Uh, just not dealing,
not able to look me in the eye.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.620
Not able to look anybody in the eye.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.180
Frankly, suicidal.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.260
- So...
- Really?

45:54.360 --> 45:56.620
I pulled him out of the grave...

45:56.720 --> 45:58.940
and I stood him up...

45:59.040 --> 46:02.089
and I taught him
how to start living again.

46:04.040 --> 46:07.940
He was very open,
I mean, he... I... thought.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.100
You know, he told me...

46:09.200 --> 46:10.964
he was taking medication for anxiety...

46:11.080 --> 46:13.700
- and a little depression.
- First thing, don't...

46:13.800 --> 46:15.980
believe everything that Brian tells you.

46:16.080 --> 46:19.700
He's, uh...- he's a little boy
in a man's body.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.723
I mean, there's a lot
of playacting going on...

46:21.840 --> 46:23.922
in Brian World.
Are you in love with him?

46:28.240 --> 46:31.420
Please understand something.
I hope you do.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.740
It's my job... it's my duty...

46:33.840 --> 46:36.940
to approve anyone that
Brian is spending time with.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.042
And I mean everyone.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.249
Yeah? So...

46:42.360 --> 46:43.940
If you want to continue to see him...

46:44.040 --> 46:46.420
well, then there's
going to have to be some rules.

46:46.520 --> 46:48.180
Um, for example...

46:48.280 --> 46:50.780
if Brian calls you,
asks you out for a date...

46:50.880 --> 46:52.140
well, that's fantastic...

46:52.240 --> 46:55.528
but I need you to call me
directly... immediately.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.460
And afterwards, I think it would be...

46:58.560 --> 47:00.180
therapeutically useful...

47:00.280 --> 47:03.180
if you report to me
everything that happened.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.180
Your thoughts, your feelings.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.940
Uh, his thoughts, his feelings.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.500
And so far as you can report
on those things objectively...

47:09.600 --> 47:12.220
from your perspective. You follow me?

47:12.320 --> 47:15.340
I'm giving you
unprecedented access here.

47:15.440 --> 47:19.180
But... I need you...

47:19.280 --> 47:21.500
to work with me.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.540
All right, you want a cup of tea?

47:23.640 --> 47:25.620
But, you know, your suspicion...

47:25.720 --> 47:27.980
is just like Brian's initial paranoia.

47:28.080 --> 47:30.300
His desire not to get better.

47:30.400 --> 47:31.820
But, you know, that came from...

47:31.920 --> 47:33.540
no sense of self-worth...

47:33.640 --> 47:37.060
no belief in himself,
no ability to trust.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.700
You have the ability to trust, Melinda?

47:39.800 --> 47:41.060
Come on.

47:41.160 --> 47:44.300
I'm helping a great man
learn how to be alive again.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.402
Why not trust me?

47:47.800 --> 47:49.740
I'm going to try, Gene.
I just don't know you.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.922
But I know you.

47:53.200 --> 47:56.010
As I told you, it is my job.

47:57.120 --> 47:59.260
Okay?

47:59.360 --> 48:02.060
You think of yourself
as an independent woman, right?

48:02.160 --> 48:04.420
Hagerty girl, right?

48:04.520 --> 48:06.460
Successful modeling career...

48:06.560 --> 48:08.900
some long-term relationships...

48:09.000 --> 48:11.020
disappointments.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.540
Your last boyfriend
took you for a bit of a ride.

48:13.640 --> 48:16.689
Had a girl in every port.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.580
And now you...

48:19.680 --> 48:21.250
sell cars.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.850
Well, we all do what we can.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.420
We do.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.140
And life can be painful.

48:27.240 --> 48:30.130
I know. That's all I'm saying.

48:32.880 --> 48:35.100
You know, I don't believe
in coincidences.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.123
There's a reason we met.

48:38.240 --> 48:41.767
All of us. Let's work together.

48:43.320 --> 48:46.740
Help me out and let me help you...

48:46.840 --> 48:49.525
and help me help Brian. Okay?

48:50.640 --> 48:52.580
Thanks, Gene. Thank you.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.489
Take good care of yourself.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.740
Konnichiwa.

50:04.840 --> 50:06.780
- Where's my favorite big brother?
- Denny!

50:06.880 --> 50:08.980
How you doing? Oh, hey.

50:09.080 --> 50:11.500
Hey, man, forget about California girls.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.660
- Tokyo is where it's at!
- Tokyo girls? Denny.

50:14.760 --> 50:17.081
- I missed you, Bri.
- Oh, it's good to see you.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.860
Hey, look, I got you a souvenir.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.700
Hey, it matches your shirt. It's cool.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.620
- Hey, Al, good to see you!
- Good to see you.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.380
- Bruce, thanks for being there for me.
- It's an honor, Brian.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.740
No way to fill your shoes,
but I did my best.

50:27.840 --> 50:28.980
- Cousin.
- Mike!

50:29.080 --> 50:30.764
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you!

50:30.880 --> 50:32.900
- What happened? Look at that beard!
- I know, I know...

50:33.000 --> 50:35.220
but what happened to you?
You're getting a little tubby here.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.020
What happened?
You should go on a fast with me.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.860
Well, I'm already eating
as fast as I can.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.780
Well, fatty, we are ready
to rock to your roll, man.

50:41.880 --> 50:43.820
- Let's... let's listen to some tracks.
- Good to see you.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.251
- All right!
- What you got cooking?

50:45.360 --> 50:48.060
You know, Carl, a samurai sword
would have been...

50:48.160 --> 50:49.500
Well, yeah, but I just...

50:49.600 --> 50:51.284
- it was in the airport.
- Does it look cool?

50:51.400 --> 50:55.420
I try hard to be strong...

50:55.520 --> 51:00.740
but sometimes I fail myself...

51:00.840 --> 51:04.580
And after all I've promised you...

51:04.680 --> 51:07.220
so faithfully...

51:07.320 --> 51:09.380
you still...

51:09.480 --> 51:11.940
believe...

51:12.040 --> 51:15.761
in me.

51:17.360 --> 51:22.048
I want to cry...

51:50.720 --> 51:53.460
Hey, Brian? This chorus.

51:53.560 --> 51:56.300
The lyrics.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.780
Don't you think it's a little, uh...

51:58.880 --> 52:00.980
What?

52:01.080 --> 52:03.321
"Hang on to your ego,"
what are you trying to say?

52:04.520 --> 52:06.300
Uh...

52:06.400 --> 52:07.820
well...

52:07.920 --> 52:09.500
- "hang on to your ego."
- Yeah, ego.

52:09.600 --> 52:11.860
Are you saying...

52:11.960 --> 52:13.820
Is this a druggie song?
Is this a drug song?

52:13.920 --> 52:17.140
- A drug song?
- Yes, "hang on to your ego."

52:17.240 --> 52:20.164
Uh, "Hang on, but I know
that you're going to lose the fight."

52:20.280 --> 52:23.660
I don't know. I... I don't think
it's a drug song...

52:23.760 --> 52:25.860
- whatever that is.
- "They come on like they're peaceful...

52:25.960 --> 52:27.660
but inside they're so uptight.

52:27.760 --> 52:31.500
They trip through the day
and waste all their thoughts at night."

52:31.600 --> 52:33.180
Sounds like a druggie to me, Brian.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.500
- Druggie?!
- Don't pretend like you don't know...

52:35.600 --> 52:39.400
- what I'm talking about here!
- Okay, it's about ego. That's all.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.565
It's about ego?

52:43.680 --> 52:46.729
That's all? Okay.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.940
I'm not trying to be
a tough guy here, okay?

52:51.040 --> 52:53.580
I'm just asking a question.
I just want to know if it's a drug song.

52:53.680 --> 52:55.020
If it's not a drug song,
I want to know what it's about.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.540
Does it sound like
a drug song to anybody else?

52:56.640 --> 52:58.020
Okay, it's not a drug song,
but is it about...

52:58.120 --> 52:59.500
I don't know, it sounds fine.

52:59.600 --> 53:01.460
Okay, okay, so hang on...
we'll hang on to our ego.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.700
Let's all just hang on to our egos
and record the song.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.940
She made me feel so bad.

53:06.040 --> 53:08.008
She made my heart feel sad.

53:08.120 --> 53:10.100
She made my days go wrong.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.060
And then my nights so long.

53:12.160 --> 53:14.060
You've got to keep in mind...

53:14.160 --> 53:17.260
love is here...

53:17.360 --> 53:21.020
today, and it's gone...

53:21.120 --> 53:26.843
tomorrow. It's here and gone so fast.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.020
You have that attached to the flash?

53:39.120 --> 53:41.885
Brian, your voice is on the track.

53:43.480 --> 53:45.020
Stop, please.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.740
Yeah!

53:46.840 --> 53:48.126
No.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.682
- Yes.
- What do you mean, "yeah"?

53:54.760 --> 53:57.020
I mean, yeah, I left them in.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.460
I like it.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.380
- We're listening here.
- You left them in?

54:00.480 --> 54:02.100
The voices? The talking in your head?

54:02.200 --> 54:04.060
That's part of the song?

54:04.160 --> 54:06.980
- It's part of the music.
- Keep in mind love is here.

54:07.080 --> 54:09.940
It's just like all
the other instruments we use.

54:10.040 --> 54:12.780
- Play the studio.
- Today, and it's gone...

54:12.880 --> 54:15.540
- Play the studio?
- ...tomorrow, it's here...

54:15.640 --> 54:17.620
- Play the studio?
- I like it, Bri.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.380
They're not going to hear it anyways.

54:19.480 --> 54:21.420
It's buried under there.
I... I think it's really cool.

54:21.520 --> 54:24.060
- Can we stop it, please?
- Jesus, come on, Mike.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.300
No, no, no, it's amateurish.
It's amateurish.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.260
It's hip, man! It's fun!

54:28.360 --> 54:30.340
It's now!
That's where things are happening.

54:30.440 --> 54:31.780
- Brian, it's not.
- Now!

54:31.880 --> 54:33.220
No, this is not fun.

54:33.320 --> 54:35.180
- Not the music, not the lyrics.
- I think it's fun.

54:35.280 --> 54:36.980
Now, it's not all bad,
don't get me wrong...

54:37.080 --> 54:38.980
but it's not Beach Boys fun.

54:39.080 --> 54:41.460
- We've done Beach Boys fun.
- And we had hits, we had lots of hits!

54:41.560 --> 54:43.180
- Why are we arguing right now, Mike?
- There's not one hit...

54:43.280 --> 54:44.540
on this album, guys!

54:44.640 --> 54:46.860
I don't care how many car horns
and bicycle bells...

54:46.960 --> 54:48.780
and jingle-jangle
or whatever you put in there.

54:48.880 --> 54:51.300
They're not going to buy
something depressing like that!

54:51.400 --> 54:54.140
- Depressing?
- Even the happy songs are sad.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.460
We need to write
some of the old stuff again, fellas.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.324
- That's all I'm saying.
- The old stuff is old!

54:58.440 --> 55:01.100
- So we'll make it new again!
- I can't go back in time!

55:01.200 --> 55:02.660
We're not surfers, we never have been...

55:02.760 --> 55:04.660
and real surfers
don't dig our music anyway.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.127
- They don't.
- Okay, I can't write about the summer...

55:07.240 --> 55:10.340
and fun and summer
and summer and fun and cars!

55:10.440 --> 55:12.460
I got different stuff inside me.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.860
I got to get it out.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.340
Oh, jeez, would you listen to yourself?

55:15.440 --> 55:17.660
You've "got to get it out"?

55:17.760 --> 55:19.842
- Who are you? Mozart?!
- Everyone shut up!

55:19.960 --> 55:21.860
Carl, play it again.

55:21.960 --> 55:23.980
It's a new creative bag.

55:24.080 --> 55:27.820
- We've got to keep growing!
- Oh, jeez.

55:27.920 --> 55:30.740
None of these guys have played
one single note on the entire album.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.420
It's like you're making
your own record with our voices, Brian.

55:33.520 --> 55:35.260
Dennis played.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.940
- A little bit. Carl, too.
- "A little bit."

55:37.040 --> 55:39.088
For crying out loud,
would you listen to yourself?

55:40.080 --> 55:41.620
First you wanted
to stop touring with us...

55:41.720 --> 55:43.620
and we accepted that, that's fine.
Bruce is doing great.

55:43.720 --> 55:45.500
But now it's like we're barely a part...

55:45.600 --> 55:47.489
of the Brian Wilson Band!

55:49.120 --> 55:51.441
You can't just do
whatever the hell you want, Brian!

55:57.120 --> 55:59.327
The other guys might not say this...

56:01.080 --> 56:02.684
but you are letting us down.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.740
If you stop thinking about
yourself for two seconds...

56:07.840 --> 56:09.490
you might realize that.

56:30.920 --> 56:33.260
Break my heart.

56:33.360 --> 56:37.540
I want to go and cry.

56:37.640 --> 56:40.220
It's so sad...

56:40.320 --> 56:44.220
to watch a sweet thing die.

56:44.320 --> 56:49.380
Oh, Caroline, why?

56:49.480 --> 56:56.100
Could I ever find in you again...

56:56.200 --> 57:02.700
the things that made me
love you so much then?

57:02.800 --> 57:06.580
Could we ever bring them back...

57:06.680 --> 57:11.083
once they have gone?

57:14.680 --> 57:19.720
Oh, Caroline, no.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.940
Sorry, sorry, Brian,
but apparently your dad...

57:25.040 --> 57:26.700
just drove up.
I thought you'd want to know.

57:26.800 --> 57:29.167
- Shit!
- Hide the pot!

57:31.400 --> 57:32.845
Fuck!

57:41.760 --> 57:43.820
- Uncle Murray!
- Boys?

57:43.920 --> 57:45.900
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Mike, Al.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.700
Good to see you, boys.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.211
Dad, good to see you, sir.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.660
Where's Brian?

57:51.760 --> 57:53.220
There you are. How you doing?

57:53.320 --> 57:54.660
Good, good.

57:54.760 --> 57:58.140
Listen to this.
Chuck, if you would be so kind.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.401
My new band.

58:07.800 --> 58:10.180
This is where you guys
need to get back to.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.930
This is a hit.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.100
Check out the harmonies.

58:15.200 --> 58:17.020
- I live...
- And the arrangement?

58:17.120 --> 58:20.700
- for the sun...
- Doesn't this guy sound just like Brian?

58:20.800 --> 58:22.860
I'm telling you,
I am taking these guys...

58:22.960 --> 58:24.530
all the way to the top!

58:26.360 --> 58:29.330
That's great, Dad.
You're doing your own thing.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.700
- Such a lucky...
- Chuck, let me know when we're ready...

58:31.800 --> 58:33.900
- for the next take.
- Sure, Brian.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.020
Brian, come back here.
Listen to what a gold record sounds like.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.929
Sun, sun, sun...

59:40.360 --> 59:42.980
Doesn't this guy sound just like Brian?

59:43.080 --> 59:46.050
I don't give a shit, Brian!

59:49.800 --> 59:51.404
I don't give a shit!

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.460
I just want to say, man.
Listen man, you're the artist.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.260
Right? You want God.
You should have God.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.180
Don't you want to be out there
rocking the boat?

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.820
What is this? 1939? Mike says?

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.649
Who cares what Mike says?

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.940
Sing what's in your soul, man.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.220
Let the world stand on its head.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.140
Don't listen to
the record company suits.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.860
Don't listen to anybody.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.620
Listen to you.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.660
You're the genius.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.140
We're the band as far as anybody
in the know is concerned.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.980
- Right?!
- Sorry, man. It's true.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.060
Listen, Brian,
I got something for you, man.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.700
Something for you, man.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.963
It'll take all that crap
out of your head, man.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.249
Where were you?

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.208
I did LSD.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.486
Really?

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.444
Really?

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.060
What was it like?

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.260
Well...

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.220
at first it was nothing...

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.369
then everything.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.442
And then I did it again.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.820
Again?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.002
Oh, I heard the most...

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.780
a whole other kind of music.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.580
I saw things...

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.762
that you can't see.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.731
Like what?

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.780
What things that you can't see?

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.260
Like...

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.885
weird things?

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.768
Things like God.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.460
- What?
- I saw God and...

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.006
he showed me everything.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.967
Oh, he showed me the future, Mare.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.329
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.660
Brian?

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.660
- I'm so sorry.
- Brian, what are you talking about?

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.300
Bri?

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.940
What is the matter? Hey...

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.420
No, hey, hey...

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.660
It's okay. It's okay, Bri.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.420
Here, come here. Come here.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.500
- Look at me. Come on, Brian.
- My grandfather and me...

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.460
- Look at me.
- ...around Nassau town...

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.260
we did roam...

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.820
drinking all night.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.580
Got into a fight.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.365
Well, I feel so broke up...

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.165
I want to go home.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.380
So hoist up the John B's sail.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.340
See how the mainsail sets.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.180
Call for the captain ashore.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.487
Let me go home.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.162
Let me go home.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.900
I want to go home.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.860
Well, I feel so broke up...

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.486
I want to go home.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.740
The first mate, he got drunk.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.650
Broke in the captain's trunk.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.420
The constable had to come...

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.126
and take him away.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.740
Sheriff John Stone...

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.580
Why don't you leave me alone?

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.460
Hey, Evan!

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.100
- Evan, could you turn that off?
- I feel so broken up.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.660
What? It's a tribute to you, Brian!

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.340
We're stoked to have you, man.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.580
Okay. Could you turn it off anyway...

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.921
because it sort of destroys my brain.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.420
It does.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.820
I can only imagine.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.940
- Are you having fun?
- I'm having so much fun.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.620
I love being with you.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.220
And not with Gene
and the whole gang watching us.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.288
Oh, uh, Gene told me to tell you...

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.780
that he was sorry
about the other day with the barbecue.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.540
That Doug gave me
the wrong dosage and, um...

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.300
so that's why he lost his temper...

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.380
and that... he's really sorry...

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.300
but he wanted us to have a good time.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.340
And that's why it was good
that Evan was here.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.020
- So, you know?
- Yeah, how do you know Evan?

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.610
Evan is Gene's son.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.204
Ah, so we're still being watched.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.765
Yeah.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.448
But we can do whatever we want.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.801
I think we should do
whatever we want, too.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.580
What do you want to do?

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.340
Evan, will you take that...

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.966
- Can you swim?
- Yes.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.380
Evan, will you take the boat in
really close to shore?

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.620
I want to show Melinda my house.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.180
Go in past the kelp.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.045
Sure thing!
Whatever makes you happy, Brian.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.806
All right, on the count of three,
I want you to get up...

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.844
I want you to jump in the water
and I want you to come over to my house.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.100
- Right now. You ready? Come on.
- What?! Are you serious?

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.380
Yeah, let's do it.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.165
Let's ditch this scene
and make out like teenagers.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.620
In or out? Come on.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.848
- In.
- One, two, three!

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.444
That is not cool, Brian!
My dad is going to go nuts on me!

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.940
Whoo!

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.380
Cold? You cold?

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.100
I'm exhausted. That was crazy!

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:23.047
Come on, come on, come on.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.740
- You want to hear something funny?
- Of course.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.620
Gene's got me on this thing...

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.020
I have to say to myself
five times a day...

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.690
"I love you."

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.241
It's called self-nourishment.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.979
Can you believe that?

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.765
- Does it work?
- I don't know.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.845
Sometimes I wish I had
somebody else to say it to.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.484
Coming!

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.649
- Honey...
- Doorbell. Somebody's here.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.899
I didn't hear anything.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.779
You got to hide
under the stairs, you know?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.881
- What?
- Hide under the stairs.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.291
Hide under the stairs.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.645
Brian.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.620
- You got to go. You got to go.
- What?

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.620
- You got to go now.
- What's happening?

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.340
We overslept,
they're going to come back...

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:11.260
- any minute. You got to go.
- Okay, shh.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.020
You got to go. You got to go now.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.500
- You have to go.
- Did I do something wrong?

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.761
No, but they're coming back.
Do you understand?

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.540
And when they come back,
it's not going to be a good scene.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.020
- Okay, listen.
- It's not going to be a good scene.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.260
- Hey.
- What?

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.700
You're a grown man...

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.100
and if you want me to stay,
you can just tell him.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.740
- No, I can't. I can't do that.
- Yes. This is your house.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.684
- No, no, no.
- Do you want me to stay?

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.420
He's my legal guardian.
Do you understand?

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.460
He can do things to me. All right?

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.100
- I don't have a choice.
- You know what? Stop.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.500
- Please, Melinda, go.
- You can stand up to him.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.420
You... listen, you have...

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.939
you have friends and family
and daughters...

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.540
that you're not allowed to see...

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.540
and it's not normal
and you deserve normal.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.340
- Stop.
- He could... he could send me away...

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.220
- and throw away the key.
- He's manipulating you.

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.500
- No, he isn't.
- Yes.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.980
He's protecting me. He's protecting me.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.220
No, you're protecting him.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.300
Listen, he is taking advantage of you.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.220
He's overmedicating you.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.220
I'm really... I think...

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.641
I think that you know it, too.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.780
Please leave. Please, I'm begging you.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.580
Leave, leave.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.900
Just leave, please.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.100
- Okay.
- Don't leave me.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.700
- just go now.
- Do you want me to go or not?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.140
I want you to leave right now,
I don't want you to leave me.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.300
- Okay, I'm not going to leave you.
- Okay? Please.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.820
- Please, please.
- But I'm going. Calm down.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.730
- Please.
- Calm down. I'm going.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.740
Last thing I want to say right now is...

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.220
I told you so,
so I'm not going to say it.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.130
That's a whole lot of words
for something you're not saying.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.580
"Pet Sounds" didn't sell.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.020
There, I said it. It flopped.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.660
- But critics loved it.
- The critics don't buy albums.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.860
Well, Mike...

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.300
the British buy albums, you know?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.200
- And they went crazy for it.
- It's not even going to go gold.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.060
When's the last time
that happened to us?

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.020
Look, you know what I say?

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:23.140
Good. Good. We got it behind us now.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.540
We can get back to our music.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.580
The proof is in the formula.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.569
Like Coca-Cola?

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.220
And geometry?

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.140
Penicillin and chicks.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.180
Earth to Brian.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.060
- Cocaine is...
- Brian.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.380
You know, Paul McCartney
said that "God Only Knows"...

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.580
is the greatest song
ever written, like...

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.100
That's because it was a formula.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.286
I will never tie you down.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.740
Left alone with just a memory...

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:05.500
life seems dead and so unreal...

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.561
All that's left is loneliness.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.740
There's nothing left to feel.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.367
You don't have to say you love me...

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.211
just be close at hand.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.970
Cuz...

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.140
Listen, about...

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.180
I have this song playing
over and over in my head.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.851
I just don't have
the words or the melody.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.921
Do you have anything?

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.245
That's good.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.380
Well, piss on you, Banana.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.244
I like it.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.460
You know, Mom told me once
when we were kids that...

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.940
dogs can pick up on vibes
from people like...

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.140
like they know when we're happy...

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.100
or sad or scared.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.300
Yeah, well...

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.722
it's too bad we're not dogs. Right?

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.660
Play that for me again.
There's something there.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.966
Really.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.500
Close my eyes.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.580
She's somehow closer now.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.641
Softly smile, I know she must be kind.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.380
It's weird...

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.620
how she comes in so strong.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:27.540
And I wonder
what she's picking up from me.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.060
- I hope it's...
- I'm picking up good vibrations...

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.100
She's giving me excitations...

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.260
I'm picking up good vibrations...

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.460
- Good vibrations
- She's giving me excitations...

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.340
Good, good, good, good vibrations...

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.620
She's giving me excitations.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.540
Good, good, good, good vibrations...

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.060
Good! Good, we got that part.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.700
Cut it. I want to move to Goldstar
for the next part.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.370
Oh, not again.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.940
Okay, let's cut, please. Okay.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.620
So try to, um...

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.460
more staccato, okay?
You guys are the rhythm now.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.780
Um, so, it's like an engine
underneath the song...

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.660
Dennis, can you be quiet, please,
while we find the sound? Thanks.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.808
Okay, let's try it again.
More broken up.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.649
One, two, three, four.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.484
Okay, Scott, that sounds great.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.443
Let's see if we can, uh...

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.940
take it even further now.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.100
So, like you're not
even playing the cello.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.363
Just, uh, like a propeller.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.810
One, two, three, four.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.420
Yes! Beautiful! I love it!

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.060
Okay, stop. One more time.
Okay, and when we modulate there...

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.260
it's like shifting gears,
so take... give me...

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.420
Just remember to keep laying
into that change.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.284
Okay? One, two, three, four.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.980
Got to keep those...

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.660
loving good vibrations...

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.820
a-happening with her.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.321
Got to keep those...

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.900
loving good vibrations...

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.020
a-happening with her.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.540
Got to keep those...

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.140
loving good vibrations
a-happening with her.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.660
Okay, Chuck, let's cut
for a second, please.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.060
Okay, let's go again, please.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.060
Let's think of this feel
a little harder. Okay?

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.700
A little stronger.
Let's really hit it now, okay?

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.131
Here we go!

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.724
Okay, one more time, please.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.447
They know the...

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.220
They're doing it! Brian.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.620
They've been doing it
for the past three hours!

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.700
- Okay, Mike...
- Oh, my God!

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.180
you can leave if you
don't want to be here.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.860
Thank you. I'm working
with the cello players.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.020
Okay, let's try it again, please.
One more time.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.361
Take 32, here we go.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.900
Um, I would like to make a toast...

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.420
um, to "Good Vibrations,"...

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.820
Brian's pocket symphony to God.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.060
And the best-selling single
the Beach Boys ever had...

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.925
ever.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.380
Brian, the suits
at Capitol must be happy.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.405
Yeah, I guess you can tell the record
company to go screw themselves.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.700
I mean, you can do
whatever you want, Brian.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.940
Right?

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.965
Now what are you going to do
with all that freedom?

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.020
- Did my dad call?
- No.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.300
He hasn't. Do you want me to get him?

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.380
Hey, Van, what do you and Brian
have cooking?

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:06.100
You know, just your basic...
American songbook, neoclassical ditties.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.380
Basic Copland,
Gershwin, Hank Williams...

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.220
a little bit of Irving Berlin
and Kurt Weill.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.940
Just a sprinkle of Beethoven
and the Beach Boys.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.980
So nothing too ambitious.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.660
Brian wants to call it...

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.330
"Smile."

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.964
Stop! Stop!

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.281
Stop.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.361
Um...

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.140
Hi, I should have called.
I brought matzo ball soup. What?

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.540
What's the goddamn song called?
"Heaven Is A Car"!

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.180
Helpful, healing music!

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.203
- Wait.
- You just have to just produce something!

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.540
- Come on.
- Put your hands on the keyboard...

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.180
- Don't say nothing. The doctor's in there.
- ...and make some noise...

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.740
- of some kind! I don't care what...
- What's happening?!

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.161
at this point!

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.007
Come here. Here, you sit down, you sit.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.620
It's too many. It's too many.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.540
I take away because
it makes him more crazy.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.900
Dr. Eugene give him too much.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.140
He's more loco than Mr. Brian.

01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.620
It's too many pills...

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.420
- and it makes him crazy.
- Write the song!

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.380
Okay, okay.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.100
Gloria?!

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.690
Go, go, go!

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.045
Gloria!

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.660
Oh. Hey, Melinda.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.700
- Hi, Gene.
- Wow, uh, what are you doing here?

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.980
You know, I brought Brian some soup.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.580
Matzo ball.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.091
Jesus Christ.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.540
This is like a sodium bomb.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.246
Brian cannot eat that. Sorry.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.500
Is... is he okay?

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.420
He's great.
He's never been better, actually.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.740
Gloria, can you make me a...
make me an Arnold Palmer?

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.260
Thanks.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.420
So...

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.780
uh... listen, actually,
I'm very glad that you're here.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.420
Um... we are finally
recording the new album...

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.780
and, um...

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.100
Brian is working on his autobiography.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.900
So he's very busy...

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.810
and he will not be able
to see you anymore.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.700
You can't do that, Gene.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.540
Yes, I can.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.220
Melinda, honest to God...

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.140
who are you really thinking about here?

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.780
Brian or yourself?

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.245
Thank you.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.260
Well, I'd really like
to say goodbye to him.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.300
Well, he's resting right now.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.500
Well, I can wait.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.860
My rules, Melinda,
and it's for his own good.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.540
And yours, too, frankly.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.980
Can you make me
an Arnold Palmer, please?

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.860
What the hell is wrong with you today?

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.700
Just make me a goddamn Arnold Palmer.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.131
Sure.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.445
No.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.924
You have my sympathy.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.900
Is this Audree Wilson?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.180
You don't know me, but I am a friend...

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.340
of your son, Brian.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.681
Well, I, um...

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.140
I'm sorry, this is awkward
calling you out of the blue...

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.460
but, um, well, I'm just concerned...

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.100
that he is not getting the best care.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.660
Oh, well, I met him a few months ago.

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.889
He came... I'm... I sell Cadillacs.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.860
Carl, hi.
My name is Melinda Ledbetter...

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.380
and Dr. Landy is...

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.660
I... I understand that there
are some legal complications...

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.540
so I... well...

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.166
you know I just...
I wanted you to... to...

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.420
A choke of grief...

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.620
Heart hardened, I...

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.900
Beyond belief...

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.540
A broken man too tough to cry...

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.881
Surf's up...

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:15.460
Aboard a tidal wave...

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.900
Come about hard...

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.460
and join the young...

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.860
and often spring you gave.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.260
I heard the word...

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.740
Wonderful thing...

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.243
A children's song...

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.644
What do you say, Brian?

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.444
It's been over two hours.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.209
I'm not sure.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.260
It's just hostile in here right now.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.089
The vibrations aren't right.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.971
Okay, let's cancel the session.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:31.649
Are you sure?

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.260
It's going to cost like $5,000,
with everybody here.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.691
Let's cancel it.

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.531
I can't work.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.523
I don't know, the vibrations
are just all wrong tonight.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.130
Two, three, go.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.260
That was it. That was the one.
Cut it, print it.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.681
That's about as good a job
as it's going to get, right there.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:24.180
Don't have to be that way.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.691
It's not my fault.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.260
All right, it's late.
I know, let's go then.

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.249
We're waiting around, waiting on you.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.820
Brian, we've been waiting on you, man.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.763
Brian!

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.740
Brian, come on.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:46.060
Brian, I thought we were
going to have a serious meeting.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.540
A band meeting.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.086
Hey, you guys shouldn't talk over there.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.460
Let's everybody come to the deep end.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.881
We can't stand in the deep end, Brian.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.620
We're too shallow for the deep end.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.020
Listen, cousin, we're not...

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.009
we're not going to let you
do this to us anymore.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:07.647
The lyrics on this album
do not make any sense.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.380
"To ride in the rough
and sunny down snuff"?

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.300
What is that?

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.940
It's a gothic cowboy trip.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.180
Brian, tell them.
The lyrics don't matter, all right?

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.980
It's about the music.
Throw the lyrics out.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:19.900
They're just words.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.180
We need to throw you out.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.500
I'm telling you, Brian,
we need to destroy this shit...

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.580
- before it destroys us.
- Hey...

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.660
everybody please whisper.
Let's... let's come to the other side.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.580
I have been writing lyrics professionally
since I was 14 years old.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.180
- I don't need to be here.
- Good, then go! Please.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.060
It's safer for everyone on the deep end!

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.900
We have got to finish this album
and we are not going to do it this way.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.420
Not in these fragments!

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.020
Breaking it up and moving us all around.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.180
The house is bugged.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.420
Okay, Phil Spector has the house bugged.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.020
He's a violent gangster
and he's angry at me.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.340
Dad is listening in all the time!

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.180
Just whisper, okay?!

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:01.363
- I know what I'm talking about!
- We're not going to whisper, Brian!

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.130
Jeez.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.367
Tell him it's over.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.380
You and I are going
to rewrite these songs...

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.324
put them together in a normal album
and get on with it.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.660
Just us!

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.762
Family first, right?

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.842
Okay, right, well...

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.660
Now, can we have a serious meeting now?

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.411
I want to do a chanting album.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.285
Okay? No words. All Hawaiian singing.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.340
And we can turn it
into a children's show for television.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.700
And it'll be completely unstructured...

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:55.600
and it'll be about animals
and eating right.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.500
Ma ha le lu lei...

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.260
Ma ha le lu lai...

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.930
Keene wakapulah...

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.580
Everyone.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.460
Ma ha le lu lei...

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.483
Ma ha le lu lai...

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.042
I'm worried about you, brother.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.567
I think I might be losing it.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.840
I don't blame you.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.928
There's a lot to lose out there.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.281
It's a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.964
Yeah, it is.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.926
We just got to stick together, brothers.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.090
We just got to stick together.
It'll all be okay.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.860
Where is everybody?

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.008
Did you fire them, too?

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:42.488
They're working on the new album.

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:48.020
They think they can simplify
what I was doing and release it.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.964
So, uh, to satisfy the record company.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.884
"Smiley smile."

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.969
Your masterpiece.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.220
Cheer up, I got good news.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:05.220
I sold the publishing rights
to A&M Records.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.085
$750,000.

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.620
What?

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.860
I sold the rights
to the Beach Boys music.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.645
Got the most I could for it,
not as much as I wanted...

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.700
but something.

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.700
They're...

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.900
our songs. You can't do that.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:27.808
I did.

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.607
Anyway, what are you worried about it?

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.242
They're never going
to amount to anything.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.860
You've peaked, Brian. Look around.

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.580
Five years from now
no one is going to remember you...

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.841
or the Beach Boys.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.580
What was I supposed to do?

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.524
That's all I got. You fired me!

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.885
Your own father.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.860
Now...

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.770
maybe we can be a family again.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.420
So, in fact, you're saying...

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.020
that there should be a code of ethics...

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.140
that we abide by. Correct?

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.980
Absolutely, and that's what
the entire argument's about.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.860
Dan Rather just wanted
to get to the bottom...

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.406
of the Iran-Contra situation...

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:54.860
What do you want?

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.580
I'm sorry to bother you,
but he wants to see you.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.160
Now.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.420
I have nothing to say to that man.

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.500
I'm not talking about Dr. Landy.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.409
I'm talking about Brian.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.441
Gene doesn't know I'm here.
Brian sent me.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.443
He needs you, Melinda.

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:20.644
Can I take you to him?

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.489
I'm glad you came.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.380
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.403
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.364
- Hi.
- I'm sorry I couldn't come to see you.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.580
It's been a...

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.842
Gene had to give me a day off, you know?

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.340
It's been real, real busy.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.010
He wouldn't let me out.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.051
Well...

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.642
It's really hard making a record.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.123
- You know?
- You don't... you don't look well.

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:19.420
- Are you okay?
- Nuh-uh.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.340
I feel awful.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:26.020
I fall asleep everywhere I go.

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.488
I'm nauseous all the time.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.700
Gene is really
a tough producer, you know?

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.660
I mean, I don't really, uh...

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.620
know what he wants.
He's really demanding.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.926
And, uh...

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.180
I'm, uh... I'm...

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.020
I'm signing contracts
all the time and documents.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.600
Making record deals and I don't know...

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.180
I don't know what's...
I don't know what's going on.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.780
- You know what I mean?
- Brian, you need...

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.660
- you need real care.
- I miss you. I miss my family.

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:01.100
I miss you.
I want to be with you. You understand?

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.580
- I want to be with you.
- Okay.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.740
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.460
But, I, um...

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.164
I hear voices.

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.260
I hear voices.

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.840
- Since when?
- 1963.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.500
- Are you kidding?
- No kidding.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.410
I just didn't tell you
'cause I didn't want to scare you away.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:25.380
I'm right here.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.140
- I'm right here.
- I can't live this life anymore.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.020
- Okay.
- It's a hellhole.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.780
- Please.
- Then let's go.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.660
I don't... how?

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.540
You and me...

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.780
we're going to walk
out of here right now.

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.420
And everything will change. Okay?

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.660
- Yeah, that's what I want.
- Great.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.060
If you're ready, I'm ready.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.700
- Yes, I want to be with you.
- I'm ready.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.860
- Okay.
- Let's... let's go.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.371
All right.

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.486
Hey, guys.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.929
Wow, it really sounds
like I missed something here. Huh?

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.900
Hey, Brian?

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.660
- Brian.
- Listen to me, man.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.780
- No.
- I'm really sorry that you feel like...

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.405
you live in a hellhole.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.900
I had no idea.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.060
You know, I've really tried
to make you feel comfortable, man.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.940
Why can't I be with her, Gene?!

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.860
For the same reason, man,
that you cannot be with anybody.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.580
You're sick.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.820
Look at you, man. You're sick...

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.380
but you're going to get better.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.820
Come into the control room, please.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.780
- Let's walk out of here.
- Hey, what's it going to take, Melinda?

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:34.260
A court order?
You really want to push it that far?

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.260
I told you to stay away.

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:39.180
- Come on, let's go.
- If you stray from the program, you lose.

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.140
Everything will change.
We'll walk out of here.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.140
- I can't be here.
- You can see your friends...

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.060
and your family
and you can get your life back.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.180
- Brian, please.
- Do you understand?

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.820
- You asked me here.
- If I let you go...

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.940
- you're going to spiral down.
- Well, I'm here!

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.260
I came! You'll come with me.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.060
I love you. I love you.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.340
- And you're going to die here.
- I'll have to put you in an institution.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.660
Brian, look at me.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:03.060
Look at me, stay with me. Listen...

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.860
you need to get back to your life.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.700
You need to get back to yourself.

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.700
Who you are inside.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.260
Please, baby, please come with me.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.700
There's no way out.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.564
No way out.

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.260
You know I love Brian.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.647
I love him very much...

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.131
but with everything
that he's gone through...

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:34.924
it feels a little selfish
wanting to be with him right now.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.620
I do not want to be
one more person in his life...

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.449
who wants something from him.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.002
So I'm going to walk away.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:53.406
But I cannot leave him
in that house with Gene.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.180
I can't.

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.442
I can't even think of him there.

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.460
Gene is killing Brian.

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.740
Gloria, I know you know.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.620
You know better than anyone.

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.820
You're seeing it every day.

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.729
I need your help.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.580
Dr. Eugene said
he's going to call immigration...

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.660
because he knows I have no papers...

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.260
- but I don't care.
- What he is doing to you...

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:29.762
to Brian, he is a monster.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.500
We cannot let this go on.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.220
I just need something.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.540
Something to bring to Brian's family.

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.008
Something we can use against Gene.

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.363
Help me.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.740
Brian! Come in here!

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.020
I think she just smiled!

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:19.124
Oh, man. Come... come see.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.100
It's her first smile!

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.806
She's got your smile.

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.140
Oh, yeah.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.380
Oh, yeah, this is it.

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:58.060
They find it in the printer.

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.340
It's very lucky. Very, very lucky.

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.540
- Sí.
- Oh.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.580
Oh, this is it.

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.682
Carl Wilson, please.

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.620
Carl, hi.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.740
It's Melinda Ledbetter.

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.540
I'm fine. Thanks.

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.768
Listen, I have
some important information...

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.780
that I need to share with you.

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:23.180
It's about your brother and Dr. Landy.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.487
Yes. Yes.

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.125
It's that way.

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.700
Oh, really? Oh, wow.

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:36.860
Her own little office, huh?

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:39.660
Private office. Wow.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.366
Our little girl is really moving up
in the world, huh?

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.740
Oh, for Christ's sake!

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.780
Don't tell me she's not here.

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:50.724
- Dr. Eugene Landy?
- Yes, what?

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.131
You've been served.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.685
Oh, wow.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.860
Oh, you bitch.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.282
Um, do you think
that you've won, Melinda?

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.620
You know what?

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:13.780
I'm going to beat this
and I'm going to beat you!

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.325
Oh, my God.

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.580
You know, this kind of behavior
is so transparent.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.980
It is so sick and manipulative!

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.820
Do you really think
that you are so different?

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.780
Oh, my God. You...

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.689
slut!

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.409
Slut!

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.020
And what is it?
What are you going to do?

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.620
You're going to make yourself believe
that you love him?

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:38.900
Is that it?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.500
And that's going to make you
feel better about yourself, isn't it?

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.500
And it's going to assuage
your filthy little conscience...

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:47.740
while you are sucking him dry!

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:50.820
You are robbing him blind!
Well, get in line...

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.321
you little bitch!

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.126
Open the door! I know you're in there!

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.322
You all right?

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.726
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.684
So, what are you going to do now?

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.322
I'm going to go sell some cars.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.244
- You disgust me.
- They call you a genius.

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.300
- Well, I'm a genius, too.
- Family first.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.660
- You are nothing.
- You stole everything from me.

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:31.340
- You're amazing.
- I want you to see yourself dead.

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.700
- You're nothing.
- Listen to me.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.460
I'm the way out.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:40.803
- You need to get back to your family.
- I'm going to kill you.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.940
- A winner never quits...
- You need to get back to yourself.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.769
- Dad? Dad?
- ...and a quitter never wins.

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.540
- You need to get back to you.
- ...such a disappoint... Brian.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.300
- Who you are.
- You disgust me.

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:52.131
- What's wrong with you?
- You need to get back to you.

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:06.340
There's a world where I can go...

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:13.340
and tell my secrets to.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.940
In my room.

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.340
Brian.

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.646
Your dad...

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.980
In my room...

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.447
My room.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.966
How many times
do I have to tell you this, Brian?

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.486
You don't do it all by yourself, Brian.

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:20.171
You need us as much as we need you.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.100
Brian, I love you! Get up!

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:29.060
I won't desert you, Brian.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.730
Don't worry.

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.420
Brian, I spoke to Carl.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.931
He's going to get you out of here.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:42.405
They say I can't see you anymore, Brian.

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:50.607
How long will the wind blow?

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:56.980
You need to find a way
to get back to yourself.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.900
Until I die...

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.100
Till I die...

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:06.200
These things I'll be until I die.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:15.060
Come find me, Brian.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.460
until I die...

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:22.700
These things I'll be until I die.

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:28.980
These things I'll be until I die.

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:32.220
These things I'll be...

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.460
until I die.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:40.100
These things I'll be until I die.

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.362
These things I'll be...

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.570
Hi.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.441
- Hi!
- How are you?

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.940
Well, gee, you just
scared me half to death.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.168
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.

01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.860
What are you doing here?

01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.689
Looking for you.

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.660
Well, you look good.

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:08.420
You look really good, too.

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.060
Do you think it's a sign?

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:13.260
- What?
- You almost killing me?

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.500
I did not almost kill you.
You jumped in front of my car.

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.980
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, no, no.

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:19.100
Do you think we could
go out on a date again?

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.020
What?

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:22.980
Can we... me and you...
go out on a date?

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.460
Gene's gone. Look, I'm alone.

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.740
Really.

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.380
I got some state-appointed
someone or another...

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.369
managing all my things and...

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.010
Could you at least drive me home?

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:38.900
- Right now?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.580
Brian, I...

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.260
You know, I have an appointment.

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.540
I'm on my way somewhere.
I don't think I can get all the way...

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.660
- to Malibu right now.
- I don't live in Malibu anymore.

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:48.220
I'm off the beach for good.

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.460
- Really?
- Just... let me get in. Just five minutes.

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.620
I want to show you something. Okay?

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.780
- Let me show you something.
- Okay, getting in my car.

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.020
It won't take long.

01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.100
- Okay, where are we going?
- Uh, take a right.

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.601
Turn here to get on.
Yeah, okay, that way.

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.340
So you live here now?

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.780
I didn't say I wanted you
to take me to where I live.

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.220
I said I wanted you to take me home.

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.900
This is where I grew up.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.445
I wanted to show you.

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.780
All right, see that street?
119th Street?

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:17.020
- Yes.
- See that street? Do you see it?

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.485
Take a left here.

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.810
Uh-oh.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.809
Welcome home.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.243
You didn't know?

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:40.020
You hungry? You want something to eat?

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.620
You want, maybe, to go for a drive?

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:44.610
Or, maybe we could
find someplace to drive together?

01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:51.964
And then what?

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.140
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?...

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:16.940
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long...

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.820
And wouldn't it be nice
to live together...

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:24.561
In the kind of world where we belong?...

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.820
You know, it's gonna make it
that much better...

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:36.180
When we can say good night
and stay together...

01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:40.020
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could wake up...

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:43.841
In the morning when the day is new?...

01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:47.660
And after having spent
the day together...

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:52.820
Hold each other close
the whole night through...

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.700
Happy times together
we've been spending...

01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:03.020
I wish that every kiss
was never ending...

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:06.522
Well, wouldn't it be nice?...

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.121
Maybe if we think and wish...

01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:14.700
And hope and pray, it might come true...

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:16.580
Run, run, wee-ooh...

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:19.060
Baby, then there wouldn't be...

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.700
A single thing we couldn't do...

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.805
- We could be married
- We could be married...

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:30.003
And then we'd be happy...

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:45.363
I was sitting in a crummy movie...

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:48.980
With my hands on my chin...

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.162
Thank you.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:54.220
Oh, the violence that occurs...

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:57.324
Seem like we never win...

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:06.922
Love and mercy,
that's what you need tonight...

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:16.482
So, love and mercy to you
and your friends tonight...

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:23.980
I was sittin' in my room,
and the news came on TV...

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.460
Na, na, na, na...

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:31.245
A lotta people out there hurting...

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.020
And it really scares me...

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.220
Na, na, na, na...

01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:43.566
Love and mercy,
that's what you need tonight...

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:52.570
So, love and mercy to you
and your friends tonight...

01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.020
I was standin' in a bar and watching
all the people there...

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:04.020
Na, na, na, na...

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.220
Oh, the loneliness in this world...

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:09.140
Well, it's just not fair...

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.780
Na, na, na, na...

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:19.445
Hey, love and mercy,
that's what you need tonight...

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:28.404
So, love and mercy to you
and your friends tonight...

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:33.969
Love and mercy tonight...

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:01.441
Good night, everybody. Drive safely.

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.940
Just driftwood floating on the sea...

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:25.980
Searching for the me...

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:29.820
And all that I have known to be...

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.700
Thank God that you noticed me...

01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:34.900
And brought back harmony...

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.260
To this lonely soul...

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.740
Oh, it's a revelation...

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:48.260
I feel alive again...

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:54.208
There are no limitations with love...

01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:59.980
The day you said that you'd be mine...

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.180
I can see Cloud Nine...

01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:06.340
'Cause I was flying over it...

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:10.980
I wasted so much time...

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:15.460
Running in circles in my mind...

01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:19.140
I couldn't hear my heart...

01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:24.087
Calling out for you...

01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.300
There's only one kind of love...

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.900
The kind that I've been dreaming of...

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.380
Don't you know it's unconditional?...

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.660
And when you hold love in your hand...

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.020
Only then you'll understand...

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:42.205
It's everything
that you've been wishing for...

01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:54.300
Sometimes from out of the blue...

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.368
An angel comes to you...

01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:59.900
But you've got to have an open heart...

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.340
I nearly failed the test of time...

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.740
But now that you are mine...

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.780
Girl, I'm here to stay...

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:14.340
Oh, it's a revelation...

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:18.900
I feel alive again...

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.007
There are no limitations with love...

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.620
There's only one kind of love...

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:32.220
The kind that I've been dreaming of...

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:36.740
Don't you know it's unconditional?...

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:38.860
And when you hold love in your hand...

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.100
Only then you'll understand...

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:45.728
It's everything
that you've been wishing for...

01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.180
Da, da, da-da...

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.420
Doo-doo, doo-doo...

01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:59.700
Da, da, da-da...

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.220
Doo-doo, doo-doo...

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:05.220
Da, da, da-da...

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:07.607
Da-da...

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:10.740
Da-da...

02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:13.020
There's only one kind of love...

02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.441
The kind that I've been dreaming of...

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:19.620
Don't you know it's unconditional?...

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:21.980
And when you hold love in your hand...

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.140
Only then you'll understand...

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.609
It's everything
that you've been wishing for...

02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:47.140
Okay, it'll be at this tempo.

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.980
One, two...

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.060
one, two, three, four.

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:52.900
One, two...

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.300
How far are we going, Brian?

02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.540
Where we were originally.

02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:58.620
as soon as... let's see...

02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:01.460
- Gotta keep...
- New track. Take one.

02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:06.088
- Count it, please.
- One, two, one, two, three.

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:31.420
All right, hold it for a second, please.

02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:33.522
Just rest for one second.
I'll be right out.
