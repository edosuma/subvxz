WEBVTT

00:00.743 --> 00:02.334
- Yo!
- Get ready, fools.

00:02.411 --> 00:05.729
'Cause you're about to hear the
greatest rap song of all time!

00:05.731 --> 00:08.232
That's right, you ain't never
heard rhymes like this before.

00:08.234 --> 00:09.750
Yo! Ready, Paige?

00:09.826 --> 00:10.751
Readier than ever, Frankie.

00:10.827 --> 00:13.679
Let's go!

00:13.756 --> 00:15.884
(phone beeping) - Oh, I'm
getting an alert on my phone.

00:15.908 --> 00:17.235
My aunt just posted
pictures of food.

00:17.259 --> 00:19.259
Pancakes, bacon, eggs.

00:19.336 --> 00:20.480
- Pretty standard breakfast.
- Yeah!

00:20.504 --> 00:21.836
She didn't need to post that.

00:21.914 --> 00:23.580
Now back to the rapping.

00:23.582 --> 00:27.192
Listen up, y'all, 'cause we 'bout
to make history with this song.

00:27.269 --> 00:28.396
Show them
how it's done, Frankie.

00:28.420 --> 00:31.030
Yo! Hey, yo! Hey, yo!

00:31.106 --> 00:32.756
Hey... Yo, my shoe's untied.

00:32.758 --> 00:34.700
Can't stop the greatest
rap song of all time

00:34.777 --> 00:38.095
with shoes that don't have
as snug a fit as you need.

00:38.097 --> 00:39.930
Great fix. Ready?

00:39.932 --> 00:40.873
Yeah! Let's do this thing.

00:40.949 --> 00:43.100
All right, suckas!

00:43.102 --> 00:44.710
I got one question for y'all:

00:44.787 --> 00:46.194
How's the air quality?

00:46.272 --> 00:48.288
What?

00:48.365 --> 00:48.955
Does it feel
a little bit humid to you?

00:49.032 --> 00:50.607
No.

00:50.609 --> 00:52.793
All right. Good, great.
Uh, then no more distractions.

00:52.869 --> 00:54.628
Phones are off.

00:54.704 --> 00:56.129
Shoes are tied.
Air quality is...

00:56.206 --> 00:57.275
- pretty good.
- Frankie: Yeah!

00:57.299 --> 00:59.283
Now, let's get
everybody on your feet.

00:59.285 --> 01:01.451
Let's get that energy back up.

01:01.453 --> 01:03.470
The beat's about to drop!
It's about to drop!

01:03.547 --> 01:04.933
- It's about to drop!
- Here it comes!

01:04.957 --> 01:06.973
The greatest rap song
of all time!

01:07.050 --> 01:08.550
Frankie: Ugh! Nevermind.

Can you believe my mom says

02:04.350 --> 02:06.125
I have wild emotional shifts?

02:06.201 --> 02:08.685
It makes me really sad.

02:08.687 --> 02:10.787
Ooh! Volleyball tryouts.
I love volleyball.

02:12.949 --> 02:14.299
Ooh! That sounds like
so much fun.

02:14.376 --> 02:17.711
(gasps) We should all
tryout together.

02:17.787 --> 02:19.954
- Pass.
- Why?

02:20.032 --> 02:22.457
No, that's literally the only
thing I know about spots.

02:22.534 --> 02:24.701
Is "pass" not a volleyball term?

02:24.703 --> 02:26.036
Not really.

02:26.038 --> 02:27.721
Shoot. Is that something?

02:29.966 --> 02:30.983
Ahh, sports are dumb.

02:32.711 --> 02:34.802
Oh, man.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.138
Being on a volleyball team
sounds amazing!

02:37.216 --> 02:38.806
I would finally feel like

02:38.884 --> 02:40.286
I'm apart of something
at this school.

02:40.310 --> 02:41.621
Well, it's gonna be tough
to make the team.

02:41.645 --> 02:45.055
They're probably gonna be
a lot of girls trying out.

02:45.057 --> 02:47.148
But with hard work, I know
we can do it because

02:47.226 --> 02:48.906
- hard work is the...
- Nevermind, I'm out.

02:51.063 --> 02:52.896
What do you mean?

02:52.898 --> 02:54.673
"Hard work"
just sounds like a lot of...

02:54.750 --> 02:56.008
work.

02:57.569 --> 03:00.904
You can't just quit something
because it seems hard.

03:00.906 --> 03:03.515
And that's the magical sound
of Paige getting involved.

03:03.592 --> 03:05.342
Stay strong.

03:06.912 --> 03:07.912
It's gonna be a mess.

03:11.433 --> 03:13.433
Amelia, you do this.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.343
You quit things when
they get too hard.

03:15.421 --> 03:17.021
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:18.848 --> 03:19.865
- (phone chirp)
- Ugh!

03:19.942 --> 03:21.650
I forgot my password again!

03:25.431 --> 03:28.114
Uh, if you give up whenever
something seems hard,

03:28.191 --> 03:30.358
you'll never live up
to your full potential.

03:30.436 --> 03:31.493
(grunts)

03:32.955 --> 03:33.955
These are broken.

03:37.776 --> 03:39.626
Amelia Duckworth,

03:39.703 --> 03:41.272
do you want to make
this volleyball team?

03:41.296 --> 03:43.722
Yes, I do. I really do.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.283
Then I am going to
personally train you

03:46.285 --> 03:49.970
and I give you the Paige Olvera
guarantee that you will make the team.

03:50.046 --> 03:53.232
Because with hard work,
you can accomplish anything!

03:56.628 --> 03:57.628
Free pretzels!

04:06.730 --> 04:08.062
Sorry, Horse Face Guy.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.491
I couldn't find your horse face
in the Lost and Found.

04:11.568 --> 04:13.408
But honestly, I can't even
tell the difference.

04:17.316 --> 04:18.498
"The Blade Factor"...

04:23.747 --> 04:25.489
Bernie wrote a graphic novel?

04:25.491 --> 04:27.507
Oh, man, this is gonna be bad.

04:30.496 --> 04:31.678
Bernie: Chapter One...

04:31.755 --> 04:33.596
(Bernie narrates)

04:40.839 --> 04:41.780
Bernie: "Find him in 24 hours"

04:41.857 --> 04:44.190
or there will be galactic war."

04:44.267 --> 04:47.119
Wow, this is kind of... good.

04:49.197 --> 04:52.117
Mitch Blade found himself surrounded
by an army of octopus-tiger monsters.

04:58.206 --> 04:59.539
Do I have goosebumps?

05:01.360 --> 05:02.467
I have goosebumps.

05:04.863 --> 05:08.031
Bernie: Zortan, King of
the Volcano Planet...

05:08.033 --> 05:09.033
(Bernie narrates)

05:17.893 --> 05:19.059
What is it?

05:20.562 --> 05:21.562
What's the option?

05:22.881 --> 05:24.272
There's no ending!

05:26.810 --> 05:29.235
Bernie, what happens at the end?

05:29.312 --> 05:30.887
Well, Grandma says
if you live a good life,

05:30.889 --> 05:35.000
you get wings and meet the
beautiful mermaid in the sky.

05:35.077 --> 05:40.154
What? No, I'm talking about The Blade
Factor: An Alien Crime Odyssey.

05:40.232 --> 05:42.174
You read it?
I thought I lost it,

05:42.250 --> 05:43.302
but when I checked
the Lost and Found,

05:43.326 --> 05:45.010
all I found was
this horse face mask.

05:48.407 --> 05:49.672
(bag rustles)

05:52.578 --> 05:54.511
Dah! I could have seen his face!

05:58.750 --> 06:01.676
Look, I need to know what happens
at the end of your book, Bernie.

06:01.753 --> 06:03.753
Does Mitch save
the President of Earth?

06:03.755 --> 06:05.680
I don't know.
I never wrote the ending.

06:05.757 --> 06:07.517
I decided to become
a master juggler instead.

06:11.947 --> 06:13.038
Oh.

06:16.101 --> 06:17.781
Wanna see me do it
with the apples on fire?

06:18.770 --> 06:19.770
No!

06:21.865 --> 06:24.265
Look, Bernie, you're a talented
writer and an amazing artist.

06:24.292 --> 06:26.868
This book is so good,
it deserves an ending.

06:26.945 --> 06:30.713
Wow, Frankie. You've never
complimented me before. Thank you.

06:32.451 --> 06:33.466
But I'm a juggler now.

06:35.787 --> 06:37.281
Look, I'm dying
to know how this story ends.

06:37.305 --> 06:38.305
So here's a compromise:

06:40.626 --> 06:42.142
How is this a compromise?

06:42.218 --> 06:43.218
I didn't punch you.

06:43.295 --> 06:46.738
Now finish.

06:46.815 --> 06:49.460
Pfft, good luck 'cause there is nothing
that you can do to make me stay in here.

06:49.484 --> 06:50.650
(lock clicks)

06:52.487 --> 06:53.687
I was not anticipating a lock.

06:58.810 --> 07:00.752
All right, Amelia,
you've got this.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.306
With hard work,
you can accomplish anything.

07:02.330 --> 07:03.663
Are you ready to train?

07:03.740 --> 07:05.217
Readier than a catfish
at a cotillion!

07:05.241 --> 07:07.709
Don't know what that means,
but let's play some volleyball!

Hey, Mom.
No, I can't talk right now.

08:00.372 --> 08:01.980
I'm narrating a girl's life.

08:02.057 --> 08:03.815

She definitely got good.

08:14.886 --> 08:16.611
Man, I could go
for some pretzels.

08:24.563 --> 08:26.505
Yes!
(sing-songy) I made the team!

08:26.581 --> 08:28.331
(sing-songy) I am so awesome!

08:30.569 --> 08:33.920
Sorry. Uh, I need to be
more aware of my surroundings.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.092
Oh, no.

08:39.168 --> 08:41.002
Amelia's not on here.

08:41.079 --> 08:42.746
Paige!

08:42.748 --> 08:46.358
(panting) Did we make it? Did we make it?
Where's the list?

08:46.434 --> 08:51.421
Uh... Coach isn't posting one this year.
'Cause, you know, trying to save the trees.

08:51.423 --> 08:52.697
Climate change is real.

08:54.593 --> 08:59.612
But he told me to tell you...

08:59.689 --> 09:02.207
that you made the team.
We both did!

09:02.284 --> 09:04.876
(both squealing)

09:04.953 --> 09:07.695
Oh, my gosh! We did it!

09:07.773 --> 09:10.531
Thank you for showing me
how much potential I have.

09:10.609 --> 09:11.929
Now I feel like
I can do anything!

No? Okay.

09:29.552 --> 09:30.955
What's up, guys?
Today we are doing the...

09:30.979 --> 09:34.297
Frankie and I are gonna go
against Paige and Bernie

09:34.299 --> 09:37.317
to see who can build the best
fort out of all this stuff.

09:37.393 --> 09:41.079
Then we'll get in and the other
team will test how strong it is.

09:41.156 --> 09:43.807
You sure you don't want to test
how strong this is?

09:43.809 --> 09:44.809
All girls: Yes.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.500
This is our humble abode.

09:54.577 --> 09:57.503
Out here we have
a nice little seating area.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.983
There's enough pillows
for you to take a little nap.

09:59.007 --> 10:01.766
- So, you think it's this huge mansion...
- Yeah, uh-huh.

10:01.843 --> 10:04.585
- But actually, you lift up the pizza box doors...
- Mm-hmm.

10:04.663 --> 10:08.273
- Um...
- There's a nice little room in which you can lay... Ow!

10:08.350 --> 10:09.833
- Lay down.
- (laughs)

10:09.835 --> 10:11.276
All right, so they built a fort.

10:11.353 --> 10:12.444
They think it's stable.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.187
Let's put that to the test.
First stop...

10:16.007 --> 10:17.007
Let's go.

10:20.695 --> 10:22.070
(screaming)

10:25.517 --> 10:27.350
(screaming)

10:27.352 --> 10:28.868
(both shouting)

10:28.945 --> 10:31.020
(both cheering)

10:31.022 --> 10:33.022
Ahh!

10:33.024 --> 10:34.593
We are now going to do
the same test to them.

10:34.617 --> 10:35.617
Here are...

Coach Carlson, you have to
let Amelia on the team.

11:09.911 --> 11:13.320
She worked hard,
and if you crush this dream,

11:13.398 --> 11:15.899
she'll never try hard
at anything again.

11:15.901 --> 11:18.176
Don't you want to help change
a girl's life forever?

11:19.829 --> 11:20.845
Nah.

11:22.908 --> 11:25.074
That's it?

11:25.076 --> 11:26.756

and you just said one.

11:27.837 --> 11:28.837
Yeah.

11:30.081 --> 11:31.672
Coach.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.008
Look, your friend's not bad,

11:34.085 --> 11:35.246

as the other girls.

11:35.270 --> 11:37.362
Oh.

11:37.439 --> 11:39.772
I'm one of the other girls.

11:39.849 --> 11:41.925
Besides, I got my own problems.

11:41.927 --> 11:44.427
Head of the P.T.A.
wants to get me fired.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.778
She says I don't value my job

11:45.855 --> 11:49.432
and every time I talk to her,
I say something stupid.

11:49.434 --> 11:51.492
Like, "Go ahead, fire me then.
I don't care."

11:53.772 --> 11:55.121
Yeah, all those words are wrong.

11:57.108 --> 11:58.958
Hey, how about this?

11:59.035 --> 12:01.110
Now, if you put Amelia
on the team,

12:01.112 --> 12:03.112
I'll make a video
starring you to convince

12:03.114 --> 12:04.608
the head of the P.T.A.
you're a good guy.

12:04.632 --> 12:07.133
Yeah, that could trick her.

12:07.210 --> 12:09.285
All right, you got a deal.

12:09.287 --> 12:11.045
Yay!

12:11.122 --> 12:13.117

a good way to start the video.

12:13.141 --> 12:17.477

dummy from the P.T.A...

in the middle of a galactic war!

12:37.740 --> 12:39.165

12:39.242 --> 12:41.362
you just doodled "Mister
Bernie Blade" 50 times times.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.756
Well if I married...
Wait, no, he's not real.

12:48.192 --> 12:50.918

show was canceled before the finale?

12:56.184 --> 12:57.776

happened to Lady Barkington.

13:01.673 --> 13:04.007
You see? That's how I feel.

Mitch Blade

this is going nowhere.

Amelia Duckworth,

14:33.932 --> 14:36.040
superstar
volleyball player here.

14:36.117 --> 14:38.376
And since I'm on
the Sierra High team,

14:38.453 --> 14:40.453
that makes us
the greatest team in the world.

14:40.529 --> 14:41.713
Oh, no.

14:44.275 --> 14:46.792
I am challenging
state volleyball champions

14:46.869 --> 14:48.945
Eggermont Academy to play us.

14:48.947 --> 14:50.947
Hey Eggermont,

14:50.949 --> 14:52.557
we're gonna rip you apart!

14:59.290 --> 15:01.182
Ah, no one's gonna get
the pretzel thing.

15:07.056 --> 15:09.632
Good news! Eggermont
accepted my challenge!

15:09.634 --> 15:11.392
But... Uh, Amelia,

15:11.469 --> 15:14.820
Eggermont is the best team in the
state and not even in our division.

15:14.897 --> 15:15.638
Why would you do that?

15:15.640 --> 15:18.824
It's all because of you.

I can finally move on
with my life!

21:44.529 --> 21:47.755
Okay, the moment I've been
waiting my entire life for.

21:49.884 --> 21:51.958
How does Princess Puppies end?

21:52.036 --> 21:53.036
Are you ready?

21:54.038 --> 21:58.307
The puppy becomes a princess.

21:59.968 --> 22:02.803
What? Are you... What?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.304
That's crazy!

22:04.382 --> 22:07.158
I know. I'm very, very talented.

22:12.815 --> 22:14.390
(booing)

22:14.392 --> 22:16.149
How did we lose?

22:16.227 --> 22:18.151
We practiced so much!

22:18.229 --> 22:20.504
Hey, hey! Hey, don't throw
your trash at her.

22:20.581 --> 22:22.506
This was all my fault.

22:22.583 --> 22:23.968
Throw what's left
of your trash at me.

22:23.992 --> 22:25.584
(crowd booing)

22:28.406 --> 22:30.526
Wow, you guys really had a
lot of trash left to throw.

22:35.003 --> 22:36.637
What do you mean,
it was all your fault?

22:39.100 --> 22:40.524
You never made the team.

22:42.511 --> 22:44.195
- But you told me...
- I lied.

22:44.271 --> 22:46.197
I'm so sorry, Amelia.

22:46.273 --> 22:48.607
Why would you do that?

22:48.684 --> 22:50.484
Well, because I was wrong.

22:52.947 --> 22:55.447
I guess sometimes you can work
really, really hard at something

22:55.524 --> 22:57.449
but still not succeed.

23:05.610 --> 23:07.200
(sighs)

23:07.278 --> 23:09.202
You know what?

23:09.280 --> 23:10.779
I'm glad you pushed me.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.172
I made some new friends, and...

23:13.951 --> 23:15.951
even though we didn't win,

23:15.953 --> 23:17.553
I think everybody had
a lot of fun today.

23:24.145 --> 23:27.129
And, hey, I got
really good at volleyball.

23:27.131 --> 23:29.965
Yeah.

23:29.967 --> 23:32.527
So, maybe you can work your butt
off and not get what you want...

23:34.639 --> 23:36.472
but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't try.

23:36.474 --> 23:39.324
In fact, I'm gonna tryout
again next year.

23:39.401 --> 23:40.492
Maybe that's the lesson

23:40.569 --> 23:42.478
I was trying to teach you
all along.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.480
- Was it?
- No.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.540
Thanks, Paige.
