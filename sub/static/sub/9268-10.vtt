00:06.760 --> 00:10.760
'Hello.
Tindall? Moriarty.

00:10.760 --> 00:14.720
'I've been calling you for
hours. I was engaged.'

00:16.680 --> 00:19.320
'What happened? Did she leave you?

00:21.000 --> 00:24.240
'I'd rather not discuss
it over the telephone.'

00:26.560 --> 00:30.000
'I'm glad I caught you. I'm planning
to steal the Mona Lisa.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.960
'I'll need an accomplice,
and you were in the frame.'

00:34.520 --> 00:37.880
'The Mona Lisa? Isn't she guarded?

00:39.160 --> 00:41.960
'Well, if that smile
is anything to go by...

00:43.720 --> 00:47.360
'Where shall we meet?
In Paris, of course!

00:47.360 --> 00:49.560
'I shall loiter outside the Louvre.'

00:53.240 --> 00:54.920
Anybody there?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

02:05.640 --> 02:10.120
Another break-in last night.
Ashmolean Museum, I hear.

02:10.120 --> 02:13.440
I assume you can vouch
for your whereabouts?

02:13.440 --> 02:14.760
Red Lion all evening.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.400
Pub full of alibis,
and a sore head to prove it.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.680
Don't you worry, Sid. These crimes,
out of your league.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.800
Out of yours, too,
by the sounds of it.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.040
A rousing homily, Father.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.840
Now, about next Tuesday's
parish committee meeting...

02:29.840 --> 02:31.360
Your message sounded urgent.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.280
There have been some changes made
to the Adoration rota, and...

02:35.280 --> 02:36.560
We're just waiting for...

02:43.440 --> 02:46.960
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
it's the bishop.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.480
Thank you, Benson.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.800
This had better be important, Brown.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.280
Good afternoon, Your Lord...Your
Grace. An unexpected pleasure.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.760
I'm due at a diocese lunch.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.680
Perhaps somewhere private? Hm?

03:15.720 --> 03:19.040
I imagine you've been busy,
this recent spate of thefts.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.520
Busy building a case.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.320
I left it in here for safekeeping.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.440
Do hurry up, Brown,
the suspense is killing me.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.920
The brazen impertinence
of the thefts,

03:33.920 --> 03:37.120
the modus operandi,
points to a certain criminal.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.960
Flambeau.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.800
Wanted across Europe for the
purloining of priceless artefacts.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.040
Where did you get this? It was left
in the church yesterday evening.

03:48.040 --> 03:51.320
I assume he intended me to find it.
You seem very sure of that.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.920
This note was posted to the
presbytery. An anonymous tip-off.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.560
Are you seriously telling me
that this Flambeau intended

04:06.560 --> 04:08.600
to steal the Blue Cross?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.160
Worth a bit, is it?

04:10.160 --> 04:13.120
It belonged to St Gredifael,
a Welsh abbot.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.280
Aside from the material
value of the cross,

04:15.280 --> 04:18.120
its veneration as a holy relic
makes it priceless.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.240
He could have taken it last night.
That would have been too easy.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.520
It seems our thief is
setting us a challenge.

04:24.520 --> 04:28.040
I'm keeping this as evidence.
This isn't a crime scene...

04:28.040 --> 04:29.480
yet.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.720
If the cross is in jeopardy...
We'll move it to Newbury Priory.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.760
We'll say it coincides with
the Eucharistic Congress.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.400
I'm sure the parish could
spare me for a few days.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.800
I'm sure it could.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.920
As custodian of the cross,
it's my duty to protect...

04:46.920 --> 04:50.920
I am not about to entrust our relic,
or my reputation,

04:50.920 --> 04:52.800
to the care of an
absent-minded priest.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.240
The cross will be chaperoned
by the County Constabulary's finest.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.520
This afternoon. Today?

04:58.520 --> 05:01.280
The sooner the better. Catch this
crook on the back foot. Hm?

05:01.280 --> 05:02.720
Hm? Hm?

05:03.760 --> 05:07.280
Only a heathen would
steal a holy relic.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.880
Who'd have thought it? Hey?
The Flambeau paying us a visit!

05:11.880 --> 05:13.760
He's a thief!

05:13.760 --> 05:16.880
And a thief is just a man with
no respect for property.

05:16.880 --> 05:20.200
On the contrary, Mrs M.
Thieves respect property.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.920
They merely wish it to be their own.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.280
Oh!

05:25.760 --> 05:28.520
Lunch. Oh, is that what you call it?

05:28.520 --> 05:32.360
Well, those potatoes look to me as
if they're ready for the last rites.

05:32.360 --> 05:37.280
Who asked you, anyway? First time
I tried to do English dinner.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.200
So I've put the feelers out,
no-one's heard a thing.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.560
We don't even know what
he looks like.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.880
This is my dish.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.240
Well, I'm telling you,
if he puts his mind to it,

05:46.240 --> 05:47.680
he's going to steal that cross.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.360
Unless someone steals
the initiative.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.440
Just get out of my way.

06:02.520 --> 06:06.160
Inspector Valentine, here to escort
the Blue Cross to Newbury.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.720
Father Brown already took it.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.440
I think he catch
five-past-two train.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.840
I still don't like this.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.160
Defenceless priest travelling alone.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.520
What better way to
flush out a thief?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.840
I'm assuming you do have a plan?
God will provide one.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.440
You'll have it by the
end of the day.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.960
Of course you can trust me,
I'm a man of my word.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.440
Three and six?!
Daylight bleedin' robbery!

06:46.440 --> 06:47.920
I'm on disability!

06:47.920 --> 06:50.160
For God's sake. I'm going
to miss the first race.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.160
Why don't you watch your mouth?

06:52.160 --> 06:54.880
The train isn't due for another
two and a half minutes.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.120
Excuse me, Father. Didn't see
you there. Please, after you.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.680
Oh, no, no. I insist.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.240
You really are taking the mick.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.920
Excuse me.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.680
Return to Newbury.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.760
Some people was born
with no manners.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.440
London-bound, meself. Penny short.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.080
Huh! Ah.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.040
Ever so kind of you. Oi, 'scuse me.
London, please.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.360
Maybe we could share a compartment?
A man with my frailties,

07:52.360 --> 07:55.040
I'd feel safer travelling
with a priest.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.040
Mr Dawson. Pleased to
make your acquaintance.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.000
Father.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.480
In here.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.720
Excuse me.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.040
Terribly sorry.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.400
Ain't this nice? Someone
to pass the time with.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.120
No room.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.760
There's plenty of room.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.880
I had you down as first class.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.200
A parlance of poorer men
will have to suffice.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.360
A cripple, a ponce,
a soldier and a priest...

09:39.280 --> 09:42.000
..what a company we are.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.480
We'll head him off
at the next station.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.240
Turn that blinkin' bell off!

10:07.480 --> 10:09.440
Nothing beats
a day at the races.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.600
Follow the horses, do you, Father?

10:11.600 --> 10:13.960
I have to confess to
the occasional flutter.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.880
Is that what draws you to Newbury?

10:15.880 --> 10:18.560
Alas, no. Ecclesiastical business.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.400
The Somerset De Veys have
racing in their blood.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.320
Will you permit me to give
you a tip? Of course.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.520
Filcher's Folly in the 3.45.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.720
I'll check it out.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.040
Watch me blooms!

10:35.080 --> 10:37.360
Visiting a lady friend.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.720
She runs a boarding house
in Muswell Hill. Two weeks,

10:40.720 --> 10:43.640
once a year - an arrangement
that suits us both.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.680
"By our deeds we are known."

10:50.160 --> 10:52.720
The motto of the
Gloucestershire Regiment.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.000
I'm impressed. I served in the
Glosters in the Great War,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.800
and before I realised my calling.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.000
Korea, for me.
Six-month tour of duty.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.720
We sail tomorrow
on the Santa Cruz.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.800
A chaplain rarely
sees real action.

11:11.680 --> 11:15.920
Polio - stopped me
fighting for King and Country...

11:16.960 --> 11:20.160
..poliomyelitis,
and a nervous disposition.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.360
Must you? Plays havoc with me chest.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.120
Interesting choice of reading.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.160
The battle to land the big fish.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.960
A parable of simple faith.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.280
God always sends us
where we are most needed.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.200
Captain Flynn.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.520
Father Brown.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.320
Don't let anyone leave
the train. Allbright, take that end.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.640
You take this end.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.040
I might stretch my legs.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.040
Will you excuse me?

12:40.800 --> 12:43.080
Well? No sign.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.520
We're looking for
a priest, Allbright.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.120
Even you should be able to find him.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.520
Ah, Inspector. I was just
on my way down to see you.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.560
I've a good mind to give
you a caution.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.280
I'd rather have a cup of tea.
I believe now they use bags.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.520
You were told to leave
the cross with me.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.480
Wouldn't it be best
if we worked together?

13:23.480 --> 13:24.800
You're obstructing my case!

13:27.680 --> 13:29.200
Just been for a top-up.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.040
On the contrary, I have been busy
weighing up potential suspects.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.760
Calls himself Justin De Vey. Fancy.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.680
Plays the country gent.
Appearances can be deceptive.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.000
Clearly likes a drink.
Threadbare collar. Cuffs are frayed.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.720
So are his nerves,
from the look of things.

13:51.720 --> 13:55.880
Quite a temper. Particularly
when goaded by Mr Dawson.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.400
Devious type. Terrible limp.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.880
So if he stole your relic,
he wouldn't get far.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.480
Assuming the limp is real.

14:06.480 --> 14:10.760
Then there is our army
chaplain, Captain Flynn.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.600
Bound for Korea. Anxious soldier.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.560
Maybe he's got cause to be.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.600
We all have our crosses to bear.
I'm sticking to you like glue.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.400
Best pretend we
don't know each other.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.200
I think it's a bit late for that.

14:37.120 --> 14:41.800
There you are. I was worried.
Left alone with these two.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.560
Not a civil word
from either of them.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.440
This compartment lacks the
refinement for polite conversation.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.600
Now I've warned you. Terribly sorry,
we're full up, old chap!

14:49.600 --> 14:51.520
I'm getting off shortly.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.840
Why don't you take my seat?
I'll find a more amenable carriage.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.240
One with some air in it.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.440
I think you'll find that
belongs to Father Brown.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.320
So it does. Beg your pardon.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.080
So you do know each other.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.080
This gentleman is
obviously a priest.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.560
His name is clearly
labelled on his suitcase.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.840
The contents of your package
are intriguing, Father Brown.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.360
Perhaps we should all
guess what's inside it, eh?

15:29.360 --> 15:31.200
Perhaps you should
mind your business?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.920
< Next stop Newbury,
five minutes to Newbury.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.280
That's my stop.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.960
Oh, come on, don't keep
us all in suspense.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.480
Sit down. It's clearly
a prize of considerable worth.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.320
I thought he was pulling a...

15:57.960 --> 16:01.280
Stay here. And this time,
do as you're told.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.840
He could be concussed.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.200
I think, perhaps, that one's mine.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.800
Oh, sorry.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.760
< Fire! The train is on fire!

16:27.200 --> 16:29.320
I have reason to believe
I may be in some danger.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.560
Then we'd better get
you off this train.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.240
< No pushing, stay calm.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.200
All right, I confess,
I'll come quietly. The priest?

16:45.200 --> 16:48.240
The priest? He went off with
the chaplain. And the cross?

16:48.240 --> 16:51.720
What cross? Where is it?
I've no idea, I swear, I've no idea!

17:30.520 --> 17:35.120
This parcel contains
a priceless holy relic.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.040
It's Welsh gold,
inlaid with sapphires.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.720
Someone wants to steal it.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.520
Then we should
wait for the police.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.040
No, I'd rather keep going.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.080
The priory is less than a mile away.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.520
Then I'll come with you,
a military escort.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.720
I couldn't ask you to get involved.
We met on that train for a reason.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.680
What about your posting?

17:58.880 --> 18:01.320
God always sends us
where we're needed most.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.720
Perhaps we should
cut across the fields?

18:03.720 --> 18:06.240
Arrive at the priory as the
pilgrims would have done.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.440
Embroiled in a race-fixing scandal.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.320
I owe a few gangsters some money.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.880
Then we've probably
done you a favour.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.320
Take him in.

18:34.120 --> 18:38.120
Valentine to Control. Relay
an urgent message to all units.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.640
Be on the lookout for
two persons of interest,

18:40.640 --> 18:42.480
a priest and an army chaplain,

18:42.480 --> 18:44.640
headed in the direction
of Newbury Priory.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.480
He won't get far on foot. Not with
all that gold to weigh him down.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.120
The priory is just
beyond those trees.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.880
You clearly value this
relic of yours.

19:04.880 --> 19:09.880
The Blue Cross was revered
for its miraculous healing powers.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.440
Miracles are enigmas of theology.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.720
Miracles are the
foundations of our faith.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.600
You must have doubts, questions.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.040
When our certainties are shaken,

19:29.040 --> 19:32.920
then our true mettle is revealed.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.440
You must think me a cynic.

19:38.040 --> 19:42.320
I find you troubled,
perhaps in need of guidance.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.320
A war brings out the worst in men.
And the best in men.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.680
The challenges of
a country parish seem less

19:49.680 --> 19:51.560
when I remember the trenches.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.040
Don't tell me you miss it?

19:55.080 --> 19:58.880
Camaraderie, the companionship.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.160
The thrilling sense of
one's own mortality.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.680
Choices you make can be lonely.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.600
Would you like your handkerchief?

20:32.440 --> 20:34.120
Call for backup.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.240
I had my suspicions on the train.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.400
Then it only seems fair that
you should share them.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.040
The criminal is the artist.
The detective merely the critic.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.240
North-eastern France.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.280
You might want to catch me
before you try to place me.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.080
The troop ship carrying the
Glosters sails from Southampton.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.160
I take a keen interest
in my former regiment.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.400
It would seem I was careless.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.800
You sponsored reason
to attack theology,

21:09.800 --> 21:12.760
something a true cleric could
never do, even an Anglican.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.000
I hoped you might have presented
more of a challenge.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.880
Deficient in reason, perhaps.
A celibate simpleton.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.680
< Father Brown?

21:19.680 --> 21:22.240
The police are seeking
to catch a crook.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.600
I wanted to save a soul.
< Father Brown!

21:25.800 --> 21:28.560
Only a man in search of
redemption would have warned

21:28.560 --> 21:30.160
the victim of his imminent crime.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.440
This game is beginning to bore me.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.240
I presume you mean pass-the-parcel?

21:38.440 --> 21:42.000
Well, I am still in possession
of a holy relic,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.560
and you are still holding
a worthless doppelganger.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.040
A troubled thief of
religious artefacts.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.840
There are easier ways to
get closer to God than that.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.640
The cross, Priest, or it is you
who will be closer to God.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.920
Father Brown!

22:06.640 --> 22:08.720
Father!

22:20.480 --> 22:22.280
You'd better pray we catch him.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.560
What do you call this? Only vehicle
I could find at short notice.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.320
I'm driving.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.760
Allez! What?

22:52.760 --> 22:53.880
Quickly.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.760
We'll never outrun them
in this heap of scrap.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.560
Too much baggage.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.760
You're nicked, Dawson.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.720
Well, I hope you're pleased
with yourself.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.880
So Flambeau and Dawson
were working together?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.760
Well, even the best of thieves
can use an accomplice.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.960
The lips were a little fuller.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.760
You see, the moustache serves
to fuddle the memory.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.360
It's a clever trick, it draws
attention from the rest of the face.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.080
The man was in disguise.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.840
At least we've got
something to go on.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.920
I'm a laughing stock
at Scotland Yard!

24:02.920 --> 24:05.320
It's all down to you
and your blessed interfering.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.840
Developments, sir. We're busy.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
They said on the desk
you was tied up.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.680
Geezer with the limp.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.400
Mr Dawson. Also known
as Arnold Quip.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.640
I knew I recognised his face.
Small-time chiseller.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.880
Plenty of form.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.800
Knee-capped during the Blitz
for crossing the Bemerton brothers.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.080
He told me he'd had polio.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.720
Perhaps if you'd remembered
this before the crime took place.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.040
I give him information
and he throws it back in my face.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.120
It's time we talked to Quip. Sir.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.640
Assuming he's finished with
the police surgeon.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.240
I'll need a statement.
Might help to clear up your mess.

24:49.040 --> 24:52.120
Double-crossed, Mr Quip.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.840
Where's Flambeau?

24:56.840 --> 25:00.440
You're the detective. You tell me.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.000
Clean away with the loot.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.600
Left you to take the rap.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.000
You were keeping an eye
on the place, caught on the hop...

25:11.000 --> 25:13.520
..as Father Brown
set off for the station.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.480
Alerted to the change of plan

25:21.480 --> 25:24.320
during his night-time visit
to St Mary's, Flambeau made

25:24.320 --> 25:26.720
a mental note of the
dimensions of the cross.

25:26.720 --> 25:31.520
His clue, delivered to the
presbytery, had the desired effect -

25:31.520 --> 25:34.160
contained panic, as the church

25:34.160 --> 25:37.200
and the police colluded
to move it to safety.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.920
Flambeau ordered Quip
to intercept me.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.160
He made sure I stepped
into the right compartment.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.200
Father.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.840
Clever that Captain Flynn
was already on the train...

25:50.080 --> 25:52.000
..so as to avoid immediate
suspicion.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.360
In here.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.200
The first attempted switch
was carefully rehearsed.

26:00.240 --> 26:05.040
Mr Dawson was primed to replace
my parcel with Flambeau's replica.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.760
As chance would have it,
exactly the moment De Vey chose

26:11.760 --> 26:13.320
to light his pipe.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.120
Must you? Plays
havoc with me chest.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.320
In retrospect, his
annoyance was understandable.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.400
Best-laid plans.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.200
Left alone in the carriage,
they reverted to plan B.

26:26.400 --> 26:29.120
My arrival was somewhat unexpected.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.680
But it gave you the opportunity
to leave the compartment.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.760
I think you'll find that
belongs to Father Brown.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.040
So it does.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.560
Your botched attempt to
cut and run was designed

26:41.560 --> 26:43.640
to throw us off the scent.

26:43.640 --> 26:47.040
De Vey's interest was
an unwelcome distraction.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.600
The contents of your package
are intriguing, Father Brown.

26:50.600 --> 26:54.240
In fact, it worked
to Flambeau's advantage.

26:54.240 --> 26:58.120
Sit down. Well, it's clearly
a prize of considerable worth.

26:58.120 --> 27:02.040
At a prearranged time,
Quip pulls the emergency cord.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.520
The perfect diversion.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.400
Another attempted switch
in the ensuing chaos.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.960
I think, perhaps, that one's mine.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.920
With the cross still
safely in my possession,

27:15.920 --> 27:18.840
Flambeau had to get
me off that train.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.520
Fire! The train is on fire!

27:21.520 --> 27:23.360
By then, I knew he was our thief.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.640
And so you decided
to abscond together?

27:25.640 --> 27:29.640
He switched parcels as he
helped me down from the train.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.760
I swapped them back again
as we walked to the priory.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.920
He could have taken it earlier,
the moment he got me alone. You see?

27:39.920 --> 27:42.960
Believe me, Father, I'm trying to.

27:42.960 --> 27:47.040
There was doubt.
Somewhere, there was doubt.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.400
What exactly am I charged with?

27:49.400 --> 27:53.280
Aiding and abetting, evading arrest,
that'll do for starters.

27:55.880 --> 27:58.520
Come to appeal to my
better judgment?

27:58.520 --> 28:02.000
It would seem he
made fools of us all.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.480
That swindling frog will get
what's coming to him. You'll see.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.880
Move.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.520
Piece of work.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.160
I thought, perhaps, he might
have given us a lead.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.640
Ho-ho-ho, you're having
a laugh, ain't ya?

28:16.640 --> 28:19.320
There's honour amongst
thieves, Father.

28:19.320 --> 28:22.520
Flambeau and your cross, halfway
back to the continent by now.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.600
I'll be late for confessional.

28:26.600 --> 28:29.160
I...

28:29.160 --> 28:30.520
Sid.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.520
Bless me, Father, for I have
sinned. It's been....

28:57.960 --> 29:00.560
..too long since
my last confession.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.200
What is it that brings you here?

29:04.240 --> 29:06.840
I accuse myself of the
following transgressions.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.280
Whatever you tell me
remains between us.

29:14.360 --> 29:17.840
I stole a bicycle. I was 14.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.280
I was tired of walking everywhere.
I took it home and hid it,

29:22.280 --> 29:24.120
waited for someone to punish me.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.000
I started to ride
around the village,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.560
brazenly cycling here and there.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.520
How could I own a bicycle?

29:35.520 --> 29:38.280
I came from nowhere, I had nothing.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.960
There was no-one to
take me in hand.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.440
Soon enough, they knew my name,

29:46.440 --> 29:49.200
a certain notoriety.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.840
I was someone to live up to.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.080
You have stolen something
that belongs to God.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.640
Every crime presents a challenge.
Wouldn't you agree?

29:57.640 --> 30:00.320
The prize has nothing
on the game itself.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.760
Thou shalt not steal.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.520
I know, I know. I wanted
beautiful things.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.120
Thou shalt not covet.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.080
They bring so much
lightness into the dark.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.640
We're rather suited,
priest and thief.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.040
Drawn into the dark.
Driven towards sin.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.920
Driven?

30:26.920 --> 30:29.480
What will it take
to stop me, Father?

30:31.080 --> 30:32.360
A few prayers?

30:33.440 --> 30:34.800
A dozen Hail Marys?

30:38.360 --> 30:41.960
Assign me some penance,
and perhaps I'll return it.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.200
My soul for your relic.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.280
I cannot absolve you
unless you are truly sorry.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.040
(Then we are back where we started.)

31:00.040 --> 31:02.320
(I am lost to you.)

31:02.320 --> 31:03.720
(And so is your cross.)

31:05.840 --> 31:07.080
Oh!

31:31.680 --> 31:33.040
Just the man I wanted to see.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.600
Just been at the police station.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.720
And I've been on the phone
to the Cardinal Archbishop.

31:40.720 --> 31:43.040
This time, Brown,
you have gone too far.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.920
I was acting for a higher authority.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.360
You chose to disregard my
clerical instruction,

31:49.360 --> 31:53.120
inclined to pit your wits against
this religious kleptomaniac.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.600
Your actions have bought
the clergy into disrepute.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.760
Perhaps a period of penance.

32:00.760 --> 32:04.040
I'm removing you from your parish,
effective forthwith.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.320
You've left me no choice.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.440
Divine retribution.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.240
So you keep telling us.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.920
Heaven only knows what
the Father was thinking.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.760
We were just...discussing
this terrible business.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.160
I imagine I'm the
talk of the parish.

32:54.320 --> 32:58.560
Fish. It isn't Friday.
Doesn't really matter now.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.640
Perhaps some tea.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.960
They're letting Quip go.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.280
Valentine claims he ain't
got nothing on him.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.560
What would I do without holy orders?

33:19.560 --> 33:21.200
Better start packing.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.480
You will do no such thing.
I will go and talk to the bishop.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.040
It's a bit late for that.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.280
We have to do something!
If Father leaves the parish...

33:30.280 --> 33:31.760
You will be pensioned off.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.600
Oh, and what other priest is going
to employ a Polish agnostic? Hey!

33:35.600 --> 33:39.040
Not to mention a charmless spiv.
Hey, what have I done?

33:39.040 --> 33:41.200
You should never have
encouraged him.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.840
I could have absolved him, got back
the cross, a simple choice.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.680
Yeah, well, nothing's ever simple
where Flambeau's concerned.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.120
You're right.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.000
There must be something else.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.720
There has to be something else!

34:07.400 --> 34:10.320
(Then we are back where we started.)

34:10.320 --> 34:12.719
(I am lost to you.)

34:12.719 --> 34:14.639
(And so is your cross.)

34:16.960 --> 34:19.560
To catch a thief, look to the cross.

34:21.400 --> 34:25.040
Saint Dismas. The Penitent thief,

34:25.040 --> 34:27.480
condemned alongside Christ.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.000
Patron saint of criminals.
And undertakers.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.239
Father?

34:38.560 --> 34:41.040
"The prize has nothing
on the game itself."

34:41.040 --> 34:42.920
What exactly are we looking for?

34:42.920 --> 34:45.480
The cross, Mrs McCarthy.
Look to the cross.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.760
Fought at Dunkirk. Never came home.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.320
He even stole a name.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.760
Captain Flynn.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.720
We're missing something.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.320
What else?

35:00.320 --> 35:02.000
We sail tomorrow on the Santa Cruz.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.560
Santa Cruz. Holy cross.

35:08.480 --> 35:11.720
Now where are we going?
The library. Shipping notices.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.160
If I know Quip, he'll be out after
revenge, not to mention his 10%.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.560
We keep him tailed. He'll
lead us straight to Flambeau.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.440
Oi-oi, look out.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.880
Looks like someone else
has had the same idea.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.800
Right, I'll get on the back.

35:58.800 --> 36:02.760
No point following Quip.
I already know where he's heading.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.320
So this is the ship that Flambeau
told you he was sailing on?

36:23.360 --> 36:26.720
Flambeau and I
have unfinished business.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.960
Wait for me by the van. Uh, no.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.160
I need you to be a lookout.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.160
And you need someone
to watch your back.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.160
You forget, I have God on my side.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.800
Yeah, well, let's hope
he pulls his weight this time.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.280
The loss of faith is
a terrible thing.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.920
No-one is beyond redemption.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.120
Is that what you say
to your sinners?

37:08.120 --> 37:11.680
I want to see you suffer.
To see how far you've fallen.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.560
First, you lost your cross.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.560
Now, I have taken
everything that's dear to you.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.080
No-one can steal my faith.

37:20.080 --> 37:24.680
The holy father, dispensing his
pastoral care, all dressed in black.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.360
Perhaps he's in mourning
for the trenches?

37:30.960 --> 37:34.920
I've seen the best
and the worst of men.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.400
Depravity even I
could never sink to?

37:37.400 --> 37:39.520
You could not even imagine.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.600
My father was a soldier.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.360
He fought for his country
in the Great War.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.680
Your paths may have crossed.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.160
Ypres. Flanders.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.480
Were you at Flanders, Father Brown?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.200
I was in Flanders.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.320
They shot him for desertion.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.680
Firing squad.

38:01.680 --> 38:06.800
I never knew him.
I missed his moral guidance.

38:08.960 --> 38:13.400
Whatever you have done,
whatever has been done to you...

38:13.400 --> 38:15.640
Do you think they prayed
for my father's soul?

38:15.640 --> 38:19.280
There were masses.
Requiems for the fallen.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.320
Even those who fell running away?

38:21.320 --> 38:22.720
Deserters were punished.

38:24.440 --> 38:27.040
It was never the
church's place to intervene.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.240
Then whose place was it? Hm?

38:30.760 --> 38:32.200
I was 17.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.880
I wasn't a priest.
I was barely a man.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.920
Your church could have stopped them.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.400
Perhaps.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.760
Yes. The church you chose to serve,

38:47.760 --> 38:49.160
your divine institution,

38:49.160 --> 38:51.840
They could have stopped
them from killing my father,

38:51.840 --> 38:53.720
even if he was a coward.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.600
They could have
stopped me from this.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.360
And you talk to me about guilt.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.600
To come here alone was very brave.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.000
Or very stupid.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.400
Quip is being tailed by the police.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.960
Quip is on his way here.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.200
I gather he gave them the slip.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.560
You can give him the viaticum
before I give him the bullet.

39:30.120 --> 39:33.640
For the love of God,
just do as he tells you.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.960
Such a Philistine.
Absolve me now...

39:40.040 --> 39:42.160
..or I send him
to hell to wait for me.

39:43.760 --> 39:47.640
Without remorse,
these are empty words.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.320
God, the Father of mercies,

40:01.320 --> 40:03.720
through the death and
resurrection of His Son...

40:03.720 --> 40:05.000
The short version.

40:07.640 --> 40:10.640
Au nom du pere, say it!

40:12.920 --> 40:13.960
Police!

40:30.880 --> 40:34.720
Throw down your weapon.
There's nowhere to run!

40:34.720 --> 40:36.040
You'll never catch him alive.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.440
Hold your fire!

40:42.880 --> 40:44.720
You want to end this.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.680
Glorious failure? How very English.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.720
Step out of my line
of sight, Father.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.320
You could call it checkmate.

40:53.320 --> 40:57.320
Echec et mat?
That would make you the winner.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.120
Your accent. Champagne-Ardenne.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.760
But of course. Where else?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.080
You want your cross?

41:19.400 --> 41:21.920
Don't let him get away. Stop him!

41:21.920 --> 41:23.320
No, stop.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.400
Enough!

41:32.440 --> 41:33.920
We must have got him.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.840
You'll find Mr Quip
in the warehouse.

41:36.840 --> 41:38.280
You need to see a doctor.

41:43.360 --> 41:47.520
I want divers out here now. Sir.
And get me some more lights! Sir.

41:51.120 --> 41:55.040
Well caught.
You know me, nifty fingers.

41:58.240 --> 42:01.760
It's over, Father. Just let him go.

42:13.880 --> 42:19.200
Au nom de Dieu, et
du Fils et du Saint Esprit...

42:22.320 --> 42:23.880
..I absolve you.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.160
Ahem.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.880
I was hoping I'd find you here.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.040
I've been speaking
to Cardinal Griffin.

42:55.040 --> 42:59.480
High praise for your exploits
in the retrieving of the holy relic.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.920
He asked me to extend
his personal thanks.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.520
He did?

43:03.520 --> 43:06.560
I explained to him that you
were one of my most...

43:06.560 --> 43:08.160
tenacious priests.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.800
Our conversation yesterday...

43:14.760 --> 43:17.000
..we'll say no more about it,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.440
though any further lapses in the
liturgy will not be tolerated.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.840
Absolutely.

43:22.840 --> 43:25.200
And do sort yourself out, Brown.

43:25.200 --> 43:29.000
You look as if you've
been in bar brawl.

43:41.240 --> 43:45.680
French, these nylons.
Bought them off a sailor.

43:45.680 --> 43:49.320
Itchy stockings with
big French holes in it.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.360
Oh, well, this is the
thanks I get? Ha!

43:52.880 --> 43:55.600
Father, you have telegram.
It's on the mirror.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.040
A woman should buy her own hosiery,

44:00.040 --> 44:02.960
unless, of course, she wants
to look like a slattern.

44:06.080 --> 44:08.120
Donec obvium iterum.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.080
(Donec obvium iterum.)

44:17.440 --> 44:19.200
Until we meet again.
