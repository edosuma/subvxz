There--

02:42.789 --> 02:44.957
There's no excuse
for what your grandmother did.

02:45.041 --> 02:45.917
Yeah, no shit.

02:46.084 --> 02:47.085
Honey.

02:48.211 --> 02:52.590
-What did you say to her?
-It doesn't matter what she said to her.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.760
She hit me 'cause she felt guilty.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.512
She should.

02:58.096 --> 02:59.222
Guilty about what?

02:59.430 --> 03:00.932
About Danny.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.143
What does that mean?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.896
I know what Papa Ray did to him.

03:07.105 --> 03:08.523
Eve told me.

03:11.109 --> 03:12.777
Let me tell you something.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.070
You don't know.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.823
You don't understand. There were reasons.

03:17.031 --> 03:20.493
-What reasons could there possibly be?
-Because our sister just drowned.

03:20.576 --> 03:23.663
-That's why, Janey.
-So he beat the crap out of Danny?

03:23.746 --> 03:26.499
-And that's fine with you?
-I didn't say it was fine.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.126
So, Papa Ray beat him,

03:28.209 --> 03:29.377
Uncle Kevin attacked him,

03:29.460 --> 03:32.505
and now Mama Ray hits me
for telling the truth?

03:43.266 --> 03:45.351
What is it with you people?

03:46.644 --> 03:49.897
This family is so fucked up.

04:10.585 --> 04:12.003
I'd say good morning,

04:12.086 --> 04:14.964
but I think I'm probably wrong.

04:15.548 --> 04:16.799
No, it's...

04:16.924 --> 04:18.301
I just--

04:18.384 --> 04:21.179
I just got knocked around a little bit,
that's all.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.431
By what, an 18-wheeler?

04:23.639 --> 04:26.184
More like a redneck asshole...

04:26.267 --> 04:29.187
who sucker-punched my ass.

04:32.899 --> 04:35.026
What's so fucking funny?

04:35.234 --> 04:38.780
I'd call John Rayburn a lot of things,
but a redneck isn't one of them, babe.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.867
Who said--?
Who said anything about John Rayburn?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.745
Baby, come on. I know you.

04:46.621 --> 04:49.707
There's only one reason
you're sticking around a place like this.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.918
Yeah, what's that reason?

04:54.337 --> 04:55.755
Because you're having fun.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.469
And I know the kind of fun you're having.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.933
So now you're mad at me?

05:09.769 --> 05:13.689
You said that you'd stay away,
so that I could do my thing.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.863
Well, did he put it together?
Does he know you're with me?

05:21.072 --> 05:24.116
He had--
He has no fucking clue.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.827
The motherfucker is so in the dark.

05:26.953 --> 05:29.831
Just please don't go
messing this up for me.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.836
This is my family, you know?
I'm getting to know these people.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.217
They're your family?

05:46.389 --> 05:48.224
Family? Why the fuck...?

05:48.307 --> 05:50.393
Why would you want them
to be your family?

05:50.601 --> 05:53.646
Why would you wanna go and do that for?

05:54.897 --> 05:57.233
They don't deserve you.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.868
You got me? Look, they don't deserve you.

06:10.454 --> 06:16.002
Just tell me. Do I have to worry
about John Rayburn sussing things out?

06:17.920 --> 06:20.590
You don't gotta worry about nothing, baby.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.427
Nothing to worry about.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.559
Yes.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.422
Why are you still harassing me?

07:01.505 --> 07:02.381
Huh?

07:03.049 --> 07:05.468
I just can't stop wondering...

07:06.218 --> 07:07.678
why the change of heart?

07:10.014 --> 07:12.725
If you gave up your best friend to Lowry,

07:12.808 --> 07:15.019
why'd you go to his motel room that night?

07:19.482 --> 07:21.859
Danny didn't kill that guy alone.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.278
I know you were there.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.533
You must be driving yourself crazy.
First, you say that I killed Danny,

07:29.617 --> 07:31.535
then you say, no, you helped him kill.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.538
One of those must be true.

07:43.881 --> 07:47.093
It's just a matter of time
before I hang a body on you.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.724
What the hell is it gonna take, huh?

07:54.684 --> 07:58.396
Seriously, what's it gonna take for you
to stop trying to pin this shit on me?

07:58.479 --> 07:59.605
Huh?

08:00.231 --> 08:02.066
Look, if you want answers, go.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.735
Talk to someone
who will actually give you some.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.363
Who might that be?

08:08.406 --> 08:10.741
Danny's fucking family.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.710
Yeah?

09:02.793 --> 09:04.295
<i> Hey, it's me.</i>

09:04.503 --> 09:06.422
How's, uh--? How's everyone doing?

09:06.505 --> 09:08.132
<i>We've been better.</i>

09:08.215 --> 09:09.216
How's Janey?

09:09.425 --> 09:11.427
She's pissed.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.803
Thank you very much.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.848
You talk to Mom?
Where the fuck did that come from?

09:16.057 --> 09:17.933
No, I haven't talked to her yet.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.227
Do you want some good news?

09:20.686 --> 09:22.396
I'd love some good news. Thank you.

09:22.605 --> 09:26.067
Well, you're within seven points
of Aguirre now.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.861
<i>People are calling in.</i>
<i>They wanna donate and volunteer.</i>

09:29.403 --> 09:32.198
And then, there's another thing.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.116
<i>Yeah? What is it?</i>

09:37.495 --> 09:41.123
You have been asked to speak
at a victim rights group.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.542
No.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.419
I already said you would.

09:45.503 --> 09:47.546
You need to take advantage
of the Aguirre situation.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.425
I told you, that's his personal life.
I don't want anything to do with that.

09:51.509 --> 09:54.011
<i>-He's an asshole. He beat his wife.</i>
-People already know that.

09:54.095 --> 09:57.306
-I don't need to be talking about it.
-You know what? You're just a cop.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.850
And you're going to meet
with victims' families.

10:00.059 --> 10:02.228
<i>It's a nice thing to do.</i>

10:02.937 --> 10:05.648
You really need to keep your eye
on the bigger picture here. Okay?

10:06.148 --> 10:07.650
<i>We need this.</i>

10:07.733 --> 10:10.861
So, go to the event
and bring Diana with you.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.405
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

10:17.326 --> 10:19.912
You know these. They're for the pots
outside the living room.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.664
- Okay.
- And...

10:21.747 --> 10:25.209
these are a new order, so I'm gonna have
to ask Sally what she wants with those.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.127
Yeah.

10:34.385 --> 10:36.387
- Thanks, Diego.
- No problem.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.604
Is she okay?

10:49.733 --> 10:54.864
-No, not really.
-Yeah, I was up all night myself.

10:56.115 --> 10:58.159
I feel awful.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.333
I'm sorry, Sally,

11:06.417 --> 11:10.296
but how you feel
is the last thing I care about right now.

11:12.464 --> 11:15.634
I would like to apologize
to my granddaughter.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.679
Okay.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.390
But I'm not gonna force her
to make peace if she doesn't want to.

11:21.599 --> 11:24.101
She said some very cruel things to me.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.561
Some horrible things.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.813
If she upset you,
if she was out of line,

11:27.897 --> 11:31.025
you could have come to me or John.
Instead, you chose to hit her.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.943
I didn't choose to hit her.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.779
So, on it goes.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.116
What is that supposed to mean?

11:40.075 --> 11:43.412
The anger, the violence.
Where do you think Danny got it from?

11:45.581 --> 11:48.334
It must be great to be a perfect mother.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.545
What did Janey say to you?

11:51.629 --> 11:53.923
Well, what did she say to me?

11:54.006 --> 11:55.674
She said I killed Danny.

12:00.054 --> 12:02.181
Maybe she was right.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.141
But we all had a hand in it,

12:04.224 --> 12:06.310
even John.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.324
- Thank you, Larry.
- Thank you, Larry.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.495
Is there anyone else
who would like to share?

12:25.079 --> 12:27.164
We have the room for another ten minutes.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.923
Um, I'll go.

12:36.006 --> 12:36.882
Hi.

12:36.966 --> 12:38.842
-And you are?
-What?

12:38.926 --> 12:40.678
-Your name.
-Oh, I'm Kevin.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.972
Hi, Kevin.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.056
Welcome.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.140
Um...

12:47.893 --> 12:50.562
I'm a-- I'm an alcoholic.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.071
Wow, that's the first time
I said that. Um...

13:02.574 --> 13:04.326
I, um...

13:04.535 --> 13:07.287
I don't know why this is so--

13:07.454 --> 13:10.457
So hard for me.
I usually like talking in front of people.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.502
I'm kind of a "life of the party"
type of guy.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.087
Um...

13:18.465 --> 13:21.051
my wife and I are having a baby.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.054
Yeah, we're having a boy.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.223
Um...

13:29.935 --> 13:31.103
Um...

13:32.730 --> 13:35.065
thing is, six months ago,
that would have been great news.

13:35.149 --> 13:38.902
I always wanted to be a father.
We've been trying for a while.

13:42.072 --> 13:46.952
But I think, looking back, I don't think
I was really dealing in reality, you know?

13:51.165 --> 13:54.293
But the past few months,
reality has really come.

14:00.299 --> 14:01.216
Knocking.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.803
Knocking at my door.
Well, kind of crashing at my door.

14:05.054 --> 14:06.263
Um...

14:09.224 --> 14:11.518
I'm-- I'm s--

14:14.938 --> 14:18.734
I'm starting to see that I'm maybe
not the person that I thought I was.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.531
My family is not really
who I thought they were.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.756
That's-- That's all. I'm done.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.759
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Thank you, Kevin.

14:43.842 --> 14:44.718
Seriously.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.771
Where are you with O'Bannon?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.064
Nowhere.

14:57.147 --> 15:01.026
I can't put him in the motel room, and
if he knows anything about Danny's murder,

15:01.110 --> 15:03.195
he ain't saying shit.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.988
I honestly don't think he's our guy.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.202
I did some leg work on my own.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.123
You did?

15:14.790 --> 15:18.627
Take a look at the original interviews
with the Rayburn family.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.549
Someone had some kid gloves on
when they were questioning.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.635
They weren't suspects.

15:26.844 --> 15:30.472
Well, there's a lot of little gaps there
that need exploring.

15:30.806 --> 15:31.974
Such as?

15:33.016 --> 15:35.686
Danny Rayburn leaves the Red Reef,

15:35.769 --> 15:38.188
goes back home to his family.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.149
After that,

15:40.399 --> 15:43.569
they claim they don't know where he went,

15:43.777 --> 15:45.487
or what he was doing.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.322
Yeah, that's right. I mean--

15:47.406 --> 15:49.867
I don't buy that. I don't buy that.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.786
They're a tight-knit family, and they knew
their brother killed someone.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.790
Maybe they were trying to help him.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.087
-That's a reach, Franco.
-Well,

16:02.546 --> 16:04.923
I want you to bring them in
and talk to them again.

16:07.426 --> 16:08.802
Look,

16:08.886 --> 16:12.514
all due respect, I think this family
has gone through enough.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.434
Would you rather
I have someone else do it?

16:16.935 --> 16:18.687
This is really a priority for you, huh?

16:19.605 --> 16:22.774
Focus on the day after the Red Reef.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.319
I wanna know where the family was.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.446
Who saw Danny, who spoke to him.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.867
Word's gonna get out
that we're bringing them back in.

16:32.284 --> 16:35.120
If the press should happen to be alerted,
oh, well.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.668
Read that.

16:44.338 --> 16:48.091
And then start with
the brother and sister.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.063
Yeah?

17:01.146 --> 17:02.064
You got a minute, John?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.027
Yeah, come on in.

17:10.322 --> 17:13.492
Look, I know we had words the other day,
but you were right.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.619
What you need, Marco?

17:15.953 --> 17:19.748
Aguirre doesn't wanna let the Danny thing
die. I mean, he is grasping at straws.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.420
What's he asking you to do?

17:25.504 --> 17:28.090
Bring in Meg and Kevin for questioning.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.765
He's an asshole.

17:37.683 --> 17:41.478
-I hate putting you guys through this--
-I know you do.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.489
Hey, uh...

17:55.117 --> 17:58.370
I appreciate you
giving me a heads-up on it. I do.

18:09.423 --> 18:12.843
What do you mean, another interview?
What are you talking about?

18:12.926 --> 18:15.637
-We already gave our statements.
-Was there something that's changed?

18:16.054 --> 18:19.641
No, nothing's changed. It's Aguirre
fucking with me, that's what it is.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.396
Does the story stay the same?

18:24.605 --> 18:27.649
The story stays the same.
The story stays exactly the same.

18:27.733 --> 18:31.653
Nothing changes.
Nothing changes in the story.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.489
You both realize
how fucking important that is, right?

18:35.115 --> 18:36.908
Yes, I do.

18:43.874 --> 18:44.875
What?

18:46.835 --> 18:49.004
-What?
-The last time I talked to Marco,

18:49.087 --> 18:51.632
he was asking me all about the boat.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.675
-What boat?
-The boat.

18:53.759 --> 18:57.179
The boat that they found near Danny.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.014
You didn't tell me that.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.850
- What's that matter? It wasn't a problem.
- It is a problem.

19:02.059 --> 19:05.812
Because I was fucking blasted.
I was high.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.483
And I'm sure I seemed totally guilty.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.612
I sounded like an idiot.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.493
He has to think I was hiding something.

19:26.583 --> 19:30.087
All right, if Marco asks him again,

19:30.462 --> 19:32.172
what do we do?

19:36.635 --> 19:38.804
Maybe we can use it.

19:46.395 --> 19:49.523
They went out on the catamaran tour.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.651
They already left.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.946
You wanna take the boat out?

19:58.949 --> 20:00.534
What?

20:00.784 --> 20:03.537
The boat. We could take it for a spin.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.667
Is that why you asked me out here?
To take me for a boat ride?

20:09.751 --> 20:11.461
Just offering.

20:13.672 --> 20:16.133
I almost didn't come, you know.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.009
Why is that?

20:18.343 --> 20:21.221
I was afraid you might tag me.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.015
-Heard you got a killer right hook.
-Yeah, well,

20:24.099 --> 20:28.270
that was a mistake that I am not proud of.

20:30.355 --> 20:33.191
Don't worry. I'm sure she deserved it.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.612
Sit down.

20:48.165 --> 20:51.752
So, what did your dad tell you about us?

20:51.835 --> 20:53.628
The family?

20:54.463 --> 20:57.007
He said you were all fucked up.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.970
That he didn't wanna be
the kind of dad his dad was.

21:02.888 --> 21:07.058
Being born a Rayburn was the worst thing
that ever happened to him.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.524
He said he hated it here.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.822
God knows why.
Idiot didn't know how good he had it.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.832
You know that I...

21:30.916 --> 21:34.252
didn't think it was a good idea
for Danny to have a child.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.423
Thought it'd be too much for him.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.137
You were right.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.848
It was too much for him.

21:47.808 --> 21:52.521
And I never asked him much
what was going on in his life.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.191
I guess I was afraid
what I might find out.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.991
But now I wish I had asked him.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.704
Then I might have known about you.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.042
And things might have been different.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.298
I doubt it.

22:24.636 --> 22:27.514
You must've had
some good times together.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.476
Eve said he used to
come by and see you.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.772
Yeah, we hung out sometimes.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.108
Where?

22:38.191 --> 22:40.151
Miami, mostly.

22:40.819 --> 22:41.653
Oh.

22:42.237 --> 22:44.114
Did you know about the restaurant?

22:44.656 --> 22:46.408
He took me there.

22:49.995 --> 22:52.163
Would you take me there?

23:11.099 --> 23:13.059
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

23:21.484 --> 23:24.279
Is it against the rules if I ask you
how your meetings are going?

23:27.282 --> 23:29.075
Going fine.

23:30.327 --> 23:31.870
That's good.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.459
This is fucking crazy, you know that?

23:38.710 --> 23:39.628
What?

23:40.629 --> 23:42.672
I'm trying to stay sober here.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.843
Yeah, that's why you're going.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.179
Yeah, right, the whole thing
is based on honesty.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.473
Honesty with myself.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.599
Honesty with the world.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.809
How the fuck am I supposed to stay sober

23:54.893 --> 23:57.395
when we have to keep on lying
about everything?

23:57.729 --> 24:00.148
Hey, are you sure you can do this today?

24:00.231 --> 24:03.318
Because if you're feeling off,
or you're having a bad day...

24:04.486 --> 24:06.905
Tomorrow's gonna be any better?

24:18.583 --> 24:19.959
What are you doing in here?

24:20.585 --> 24:22.337
Looking for the necklace.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.297
What--? What necklace?

24:24.381 --> 24:27.759
The seahorse Danny gave me. Dad took it.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.428
You can't go through your dad's stuff
like that. You know that.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.473
But it was a gift. It's mine.

24:35.475 --> 24:39.938
Honey, I know you liked Danny.
He was always nice to you.

24:40.605 --> 24:43.441
But there is so much
that you don't understand.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.069
Like what?

24:48.530 --> 24:50.907
Take them out of town for a while.

24:53.743 --> 24:58.039
That day he took you out on the boat,
he was threatening you.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.501
-What are you talking about?
-He's the reason that we went away.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.503
-What is--? What is--?
-We were afraid of him.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.673
And Dad was gonna do anything
in his power to keep you safe.

25:07.424 --> 25:09.801
What do you mean, keep me safe?

25:11.302 --> 25:13.555
And while we're running away,
what are you gonna be doing?

25:14.097 --> 25:15.890
I don't know.

25:20.562 --> 25:24.023
Mom, what does that even mean?

25:25.400 --> 25:27.777
It means that Danny was dangerous.

25:30.572 --> 25:34.242
And Dad had to make sure
that he couldn't hurt us.

25:38.163 --> 25:41.374
He wasn't dangerous
and he was not threatening me.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.251
I was there.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.186
-You ready?
-Mm-hm.

26:04.814 --> 26:08.359
Did Danny ever tell you
what went down at the Red Reef Inn?

26:09.611 --> 26:11.029
No.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.449
When was the last time you saw Danny?

26:15.992 --> 26:17.285
Um...

26:17.368 --> 26:23.500
I think I said this before, that night
at the inn with my mom, and Meg and John.

26:24.209 --> 26:26.586
And that night,
did he mention Eric O'Bannon?

26:27.003 --> 26:29.380
No, not that I remember.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.132
All right.

26:36.137 --> 26:40.016
After Danny left you guys that night,
do you know where he went?

26:41.434 --> 26:42.477
Uh-uh.

26:45.355 --> 26:46.689
Where'd you go?

26:47.232 --> 26:49.400
-Me?
-You.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.029
-Do you remember?
-Yeah, yeah, I remember.

26:53.905 --> 26:54.906
Um...

26:59.035 --> 27:02.872
Danny said some really, really
horrible things to my mom that night.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.666
-Mm-hm.
-And I, uh...

27:05.625 --> 27:07.710
I got pretty riled up.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.588
And I just basically lost it.

27:11.756 --> 27:14.634
"Lost it"? What do you mean?

27:17.762 --> 27:19.806
I went on a bender.

27:20.473 --> 27:25.144
After Danny left the inn that night,
I went back to my shithole of an office

27:25.228 --> 27:30.066
and I basically shoveled snow
and did shots until I blacked out.

27:38.658 --> 27:41.119
Now, the following morning,
John had the heart episode.

27:44.873 --> 27:46.499
Did you see Danny that day?

27:46.583 --> 27:50.461
No, last time I saw him was that night.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.592
Where were you that day?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.136
The day that John fell ill.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.179
Uh...

28:00.722 --> 28:04.350
Well, obviously, I was worried about John,
so I went to go see him at the hospital.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.894
Mm-hm.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.646
See, it says here,
the attending nurse said that

28:08.730 --> 28:12.525
you didn't get there till the afternoon.
Is that true?

28:13.693 --> 28:14.819
Mm-hm.

28:14.903 --> 28:18.406
-That's right.
-Okay, so where were you in the morning?

28:25.246 --> 28:26.706
Kevin.

28:33.296 --> 28:35.924
I can't live like this anymore, man.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.808
Kevin, where were you in the morning?

28:51.773 --> 28:55.318
Meg called me,
but I didn't go to the hospital.

28:59.364 --> 29:00.990
Why not?

29:07.580 --> 29:10.208
I was tweaking. And I, um...

29:11.626 --> 29:15.964
I had to just keep on driving that train.
I went to go score some more cocaine.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.302
And there's something else
I have to tell you.

29:24.973 --> 29:27.934
Um, the day that you took me
down to the police yard

29:28.017 --> 29:29.394
to show me the burned-out boat...

29:29.936 --> 29:30.937
Yeah?

29:31.020 --> 29:33.022
I was really high that day.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.738
And I lied to you.
I said I had never seen the boat before.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.490
-Had you seen the boat?
-Several times.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.576
-Where?
-In my boatyard.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.915
That boat could have been a key to solving
Danny's murder, do you understand that?

29:50.999 --> 29:53.084
I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

29:53.167 --> 29:56.379
Why the fuck
would you lie to me about that?

29:57.630 --> 29:59.173
I lied...

30:00.633 --> 30:05.847
I lied because the guy who brought
the boat in for repairs was my dealer.

30:06.389 --> 30:07.348
What's his name?

30:09.100 --> 30:11.686
I don't know his name, man.
He was my dealer.

30:11.769 --> 30:14.147
Well, what did he look like,
do you remember that?

30:17.900 --> 30:19.777
What did he look like?

30:21.988 --> 30:24.198
He had bleached hair.

30:29.787 --> 30:32.582
He had a gold tooth.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.430
Holy shit, that's him. Yeah.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.599
The guy's name is Rafi Quintana.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.603
He worked for Wayne Lowry.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.398
Are you serious?

30:58.232 --> 31:02.695
We've always thought that Danny's body
was found near one of Lowry's boats.

31:03.154 --> 31:05.406
If Quintana was involved,

31:06.157 --> 31:07.992
that confirms it.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.674
How did it go?

31:25.843 --> 31:28.054
He made a break in the case.

31:30.848 --> 31:31.933
Good job.

31:36.646 --> 31:39.899
Trust me, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.688
And while we're running away,
what are you gonna be doing?

32:18.771 --> 32:20.731
I don't know.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.069
What are you gonna be doing, John?!

32:25.153 --> 32:27.196
I don't fucking know!

32:28.656 --> 32:31.534
<i> Listen, I know that</i>
<i>when you sent me away with the kids,</i>

32:31.617 --> 32:33.369
that there were things you didn't tell me.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.122
Yes, there were.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.961
Why don't you tell me exactly what it is
that you wanna know?

32:42.044 --> 32:46.174
-You still tried to help him.
-I didn't help him though. Now he's dead.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.009
-So, what the fuck does it matter?
-Right.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.778
So, Danny didn't say anything
about being at the Red Reef motel?

33:07.862 --> 33:09.113
No.

33:09.197 --> 33:13.034
That night at the inn,
he never said anything about it.

33:13.534 --> 33:17.955
And during this period,
did he ever talk about Eric O'Bannon?

33:18.706 --> 33:22.543
No. I mean,
I knew they'd been hanging out, but...

33:26.464 --> 33:27.673
Eric was at Dad's funeral.

33:28.716 --> 33:30.551
Yeah, I remember.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.223
The day after the Red Reef...

33:36.307 --> 33:38.809
that's the day that John
had the heart episode.

33:38.893 --> 33:42.480
Yeah, he got light-headed doing yard work

33:42.563 --> 33:45.233
so I picked him up,
and I took him to the hospital.

33:45.733 --> 33:48.361
Mm-hm. Any thoughts why he called you?

33:49.362 --> 33:51.739
Diana and the kids were away.

33:53.449 --> 33:55.493
Any idea where Danny was that day?

33:56.994 --> 34:00.373
No. The night before at the inn
was the last time that I saw him.

34:00.456 --> 34:02.625
How about the day after that?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.211
Did you see him then?

34:05.294 --> 34:08.130
No, I just told you,
that was the last time I saw him.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.968
I'm just trying to pin down where
Danny was the days following the Red Reef.

34:12.802 --> 34:17.181
So, that day you had no idea where
Danny was. What about the following day?

34:18.641 --> 34:20.476
I went to New York.

34:23.396 --> 34:26.524
The night before you left to New York,
I went by your house. Do you remember?

34:28.401 --> 34:29.860
Of course.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.321
Yes.

34:36.993 --> 34:39.328
I just came from seeing John
at the hospital.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.497
Yeah.

34:41.956 --> 34:45.876
It's not like you to leave your brother
in a hospital bed and take off.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.170
Yeah, I had already had it planned.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.423
Why were you in such a hurry
to get out of town?

34:51.048 --> 34:54.135
I mean, when I got to your house,
you were outside, in the driveway,

34:54.218 --> 34:58.431
in the pouring rain, putting your
suitcases in the trunk of your car.

34:58.806 --> 34:59.807
Mm-hm.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.978
-So?
-So, you don't think that's strange?

35:04.061 --> 35:04.895
Hm?

35:04.979 --> 35:06.147
You get home from the hospital.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.774
The first thing you do is
put your luggage in the trunk?

35:08.858 --> 35:10.192
Yeah.

35:10.276 --> 35:13.988
It was pouring rain.
You weren't leaving till the next day.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.869
Is, uh--? Is there a question?

35:20.536 --> 35:22.204
The next day when you went to the airport,

35:22.288 --> 35:24.707
did you drive yourself in your own car,
or did you take a cab?

35:26.959 --> 35:28.961
I-- I don't understand.
Why does that matter?

35:29.045 --> 35:31.422
Your car was in your driveway
while you were out of town.

35:31.547 --> 35:32.548
Because I took a cab.

35:32.965 --> 35:35.676
Why would you put luggage
in the trunk of your car the night before?

35:35.760 --> 35:38.471
Because I was going to drive,
but then I changed my mind.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.431
Why were you so upset that night?

35:40.514 --> 35:43.351
I mean, I've known you a long time, Meg.
I've never seen you like that.

35:43.434 --> 35:46.395
Come on, seriously? Think about the shit
that was going on with my family.

35:46.479 --> 35:48.356
That's why I went to your house.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.816
And when I got there,

35:50.900 --> 35:53.944
I got the impression that you
didn't want me anywhere near you.

35:54.028 --> 35:55.571
That's because we had just broken up.

35:55.655 --> 35:58.741
Or you saw my car pull into the driveway,

35:58.824 --> 36:00.660
and you didn't want me
anywhere near your house.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.746
I don't understand what you're asking me.

36:04.121 --> 36:06.290
I know Danny was difficult.

36:07.291 --> 36:10.002
And I also know how much
you cared about him.

36:14.423 --> 36:15.299
Yeah, I did.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.303
He murdered someone the night before.

36:19.387 --> 36:21.764
When I got to your house,
you were panicking.

36:22.515 --> 36:24.684
-No, I wouldn't say that.
-Were you helping him?

36:25.434 --> 36:27.269
-What?
-Were you protecting your brother?

36:27.353 --> 36:30.106
-Was Danny there that night?
-No, of course not.

36:30.398 --> 36:32.983
Was he inside the house,
and that's why you didn't want me around?

36:33.067 --> 36:35.486
No, I didn't want you around
because I didn't want you around.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.905
That night I got there,
you looked like you were hiding something.

36:37.988 --> 36:40.991
I pulled in, you were panicking.
You didn't want me to go near your house.

36:41.075 --> 36:43.661
What are you doing?
Okay, my brother was killed.

36:43.744 --> 36:46.914
My family is a victim in all of this.
Why are you treating me like a suspect?

36:47.331 --> 36:48.541
I'm just asking some questions.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.918
I don't have to be here.
I'm doing this to be helpful.

36:51.001 --> 36:53.504
Well, you're not being
very helpful right now, Meg.

36:55.005 --> 36:58.050
I had no other contact with Danny
after that night.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.136
That's the answer to your question.
I'm done now.

37:01.554 --> 37:03.389
This is bullshit, and you know it.

37:25.911 --> 37:29.081
Your sister wanted to know if you'd like
us to select anecdotal material for you.

37:29.707 --> 37:31.584
"Anecdotal material"?

37:31.667 --> 37:33.919
For the victims' rights group tonight.

37:34.795 --> 37:37.423
No, I think I've got it worked out.

37:37.506 --> 37:38.382
Thank you.

37:38.466 --> 37:39.300
Mm-hm.

37:52.146 --> 37:53.564
Hey.

38:00.988 --> 38:02.406
Well, how'd it go?

38:02.490 --> 38:04.450
It was great. It went great.

38:06.619 --> 38:07.828
No surprises?

38:07.912 --> 38:09.205
No.

38:12.416 --> 38:15.377
Are you ready for this thing?
Do you know what you wanna say?

38:15.461 --> 38:19.840
Yeah. I think I'm gonna keep it
a little bit more informal, but yeah.

38:20.674 --> 38:22.384
All right.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.805
You know what, can you just make sure
that you make the most of this, please?

38:29.850 --> 38:31.602
You need anything else?

38:32.520 --> 38:33.896
No.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.107
All right, let me know how it goes.

39:23.487 --> 39:24.488
What?

39:27.908 --> 39:28.951
Nothing.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.884
Janey was going through
your dresser earlier.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.637
She was looking for the necklace
that Danny gave her.

39:53.809 --> 39:54.852
Where is it?

40:04.069 --> 40:05.946
I don't know.

40:06.614 --> 40:08.616
Well, what do you think happened to it?

40:08.699 --> 40:10.534
Honey, I just told you,
I don't know.

40:13.454 --> 40:14.705
How could you not know? I mean--

40:14.788 --> 40:17.625
I don't know because I got rid of it,
that's why.

40:18.918 --> 40:20.461
You got rid of it?

40:22.254 --> 40:24.006
Why would you get rid of it, John?

40:24.506 --> 40:27.760
-Why would you do that?
-Why the fuck would I keep it anyway?!

40:27.843 --> 40:29.845
Danny threatened Janey with it.

40:30.387 --> 40:33.641
Explain to me why I would wanna
keep something like that.

40:42.775 --> 40:44.318
Which tie?

40:47.529 --> 40:49.531
What's happening with you?

40:52.076 --> 40:54.995
I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm sorry.

40:55.079 --> 40:56.789
Something's off.

40:59.166 --> 41:02.795
The other day, for the first time
in our entire marriage...

41:03.504 --> 41:05.673
you actually scared me.

41:11.553 --> 41:14.390
And these--
What are these? Bruises on your hands?

41:14.473 --> 41:17.309
I don't know because I'm afraid to
even ask you about that. Why is that?

41:17.393 --> 41:19.561
Wanna ask about my hands?
Go ahead. It happened at work.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.480
-You want me to tell you?
-Are they from work?

41:21.563 --> 41:24.900
As long as they're from work. That's your
answer to everything these days, isn't it?

41:28.195 --> 41:29.822
It's work.

41:32.324 --> 41:35.828
When you're out late,
when you're distant with me...

41:36.453 --> 41:39.415
when your hands are
fucking covered in bruises.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.840
I want you to see someone.
I want you to go to a therapist.

41:47.923 --> 41:50.801
-I'm not gonna see a therapist.
-Then I'm not doing this.

41:50.884 --> 41:54.179
I'm not living with the fear,
and I'm not living with you lying to me.

42:49.026 --> 42:50.736
<i>You think you know my family, right?</i>

42:51.653 --> 42:53.447
No. I mean,

42:53.530 --> 42:55.866
I only know what you told me.

42:58.869 --> 43:01.455
There's a lot of things you don't know.

43:04.083 --> 43:06.543
A lot of stuff that's personal.

43:06.627 --> 43:08.295
It's awful, it's humiliating.

43:09.505 --> 43:11.757
Stuff that I don't want anyone to know.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.759
This is a murder case.

43:14.885 --> 43:17.346
You have to explain
what you're talking about.

43:18.764 --> 43:21.642
You wanna know why I didn't tell you
everything about Danny?

43:21.725 --> 43:25.562
-Do you wanna know about my family?
-Yeah.

43:27.481 --> 43:29.858
Okay, I'll start with my parents.

43:31.568 --> 43:33.737
Their marriage was shitty.

43:34.404 --> 43:36.281
My mom left us when we were kids.

43:37.741 --> 43:39.409
I didn't know this.

43:39.827 --> 43:42.412
And you know what happened when she left?

43:42.496 --> 43:46.125
Danny took my sister Sarah...
out on a boat,

43:46.208 --> 43:48.794
and she drowned
at the bottom of Whale Harbor.

43:49.711 --> 43:50.921
I'm sorry, Meg.

43:51.004 --> 43:54.800
That's just the beginning,
because when my dad found out,

43:54.883 --> 43:56.176
he went...

43:57.469 --> 44:00.180
He attacked Danny,
and he beat the shit out of him

44:00.264 --> 44:02.015
and put him in the hospital.

44:03.350 --> 44:06.645
And when Danny finally came home,
and police came to investigate,

44:06.728 --> 44:10.107
my mom had already gotten to us.

44:11.024 --> 44:12.609
What do you mean?

44:14.153 --> 44:16.572
She made us bury the truth.

44:17.447 --> 44:22.327
My mom had John, Kevin and I
all lie to the cops

44:22.411 --> 44:24.538
to protect my dad.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.501
It's awful.

44:30.419 --> 44:35.257
And the more you know about us,
the more horrible it gets.

44:36.717 --> 44:39.219
We're not the people
that you think we are.

44:44.183 --> 44:48.187
That's why I had to end it... with you.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.442
Because I wanted to get away.

44:53.525 --> 44:56.278
I wanted to leave
and I wanted to never come back,

44:56.361 --> 45:00.324
but I couldn't
because of my fucking family.

45:03.243 --> 45:04.328
I'm sorry.

45:09.333 --> 45:13.003
I fucking-- I fucking hate them.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.304
I'm sorry, Meg.

45:22.387 --> 45:26.308
I know what Aguirre
is telling you to do, and I know why.

45:26.391 --> 45:28.894
-I'm just doing my job.
-I know.

45:31.438 --> 45:34.608
But you need to decide
who you're loyal to.

45:35.525 --> 45:39.071
Him... or us?

46:23.448 --> 46:24.491
As you all know,

46:24.574 --> 46:27.452
domestic violence
has been in the news lately.

46:27.703 --> 46:30.831
It's important to take a moment,

46:30.914 --> 46:36.503
and to use this opportunity
to open a dialogue.

46:36.586 --> 46:39.006
Not just for domestic violence,

46:39.089 --> 46:43.093
but for victims of violence in general.

46:43.176 --> 46:47.889
And we're very lucky to have John Rayburn
here with us this evening.

46:47.973 --> 46:51.893
Now, Detective Rayburn
is not only a candidate for sheriff,

46:51.977 --> 46:56.982
but someone whose own family
has been touched by violence.

46:58.525 --> 47:01.403
I'd like to welcome him here

47:01.486 --> 47:05.365
and thank him
for offering his perspective.

47:08.452 --> 47:10.162
Thank you.

47:11.788 --> 47:13.248
Thank you.

47:13.874 --> 47:14.916
Uh...

47:17.586 --> 47:20.172
I never expected to be here,

47:20.255 --> 47:23.633
as I'm sure that none of you
ever expected to be here either.

47:24.718 --> 47:26.762
And yet here we are.

47:28.805 --> 47:30.891
I'm a police officer.

47:31.433 --> 47:33.727
As a police officer,

47:33.810 --> 47:38.106
violence... is part of my everyday life.

47:39.316 --> 47:44.488
But that's not the same
as experiencing violence personally.

47:44.571 --> 47:48.617
That is to say,
having violence perpetrated against you,

47:48.700 --> 47:51.661
and/or maybe even losing a loved one.

47:52.579 --> 47:53.622
As Marcia said,

47:53.705 --> 47:57.876
many people believe that violence
only occurs on the 6:00 news.

47:57.959 --> 47:59.795
It only happens to other people.

48:08.637 --> 48:12.390
You know, something that the public
doesn't always know

48:12.474 --> 48:15.936
is that when the police work a homicide,

48:16.436 --> 48:20.440
they refer to the case
by the victim's name only.

48:22.150 --> 48:25.862
I never realized how important that was...

48:27.155 --> 48:31.201
until my brother Danny Rayburn
lost his life to violence.

48:36.039 --> 48:38.625
Violence is particularly difficult

48:38.708 --> 48:43.004
when it... happens in the family,

48:43.088 --> 48:45.882
and I have experienced that as well.

48:45.966 --> 48:47.926
Many of you
that have been through it here,

48:48.009 --> 48:51.388
I can tell you that I understand,
not just...

48:52.806 --> 48:54.641
Not just the sadness involved with it,

48:54.724 --> 49:00.021
but also the guilt associated with it.

49:01.815 --> 49:03.441
You wonder...

49:04.401 --> 49:05.569
You wonder if you're to blame,

49:05.652 --> 49:09.739
because it is so very easy to be silent
when there is violence in a family.

49:11.074 --> 49:16.246
It's very easy to be ashamed...
when you don't speak up.

49:19.166 --> 49:23.211
I think that's why it's so very important
that we're here talking about this.

49:25.630 --> 49:28.508
To remind each other to be on guard.

49:42.689 --> 49:44.774
As much as we're...

49:44.858 --> 49:47.903
As much as we're scared to admit it,

49:48.570 --> 49:51.615
that violence lies within all of us.

49:53.491 --> 49:55.869
We're all capable of it.

50:00.040 --> 50:01.917
Thank you for that.

50:02.918 --> 50:07.172
Um, maybe we can take some questions?

50:08.423 --> 50:09.966
- Yes, sir?
- Um...

50:11.468 --> 50:13.887
That must have been a lot, hm?

50:14.846 --> 50:16.765
Living with all that?

50:18.642 --> 50:20.101
Yeah.

50:26.399 --> 50:28.485
I'm still curious.

50:31.238 --> 50:32.739
About what?

50:33.740 --> 50:36.117
That night in your driveway...

50:37.535 --> 50:39.496
why were you panicking?

50:44.251 --> 50:46.211
Because you were right.

50:46.753 --> 50:48.838
There was somebody in my house.

50:49.589 --> 50:51.216
Danny?

50:54.552 --> 50:57.097
It was the guy that I cheated on you with.

51:08.817 --> 51:10.110
Do I know him?

51:11.778 --> 51:14.030
No, he's not from here.

51:16.574 --> 51:17.909
What's his name?

51:22.330 --> 51:24.207
You don't know him.

51:34.342 --> 51:35.885
Hey.

51:37.345 --> 51:39.222
What's his name?

51:40.724 --> 51:42.726
Alec Moros.

51:42.809 --> 51:44.227
Okay?

51:49.733 --> 51:52.569
You know, I know it's stupid
to say now, but...

51:53.320 --> 51:57.157
I really am sorry
for everything that I put you through.

52:06.750 --> 52:08.335
Marcia, excuse me.

52:08.418 --> 52:11.379
-Oh, thank you for coming.
-Uh, thank you very much.

52:11.463 --> 52:13.757
I mean,
it was obvious to everyone in this room

52:13.840 --> 52:15.675
that you were speaking from the heart,
so--

52:15.759 --> 52:18.887
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you for having me.

52:18.970 --> 52:20.972
Have you seen my wife, by chance?

52:21.056 --> 52:23.683
Um, no. Not since the panel.

52:24.893 --> 52:26.895
Okay. Thank you for everything again.

52:26.978 --> 52:28.563
No problem.

52:37.947 --> 52:41.326
<i>Hi, it's Diana, please leave a message.</i>

52:50.794 --> 52:52.337
Shit.

52:54.047 --> 52:55.799
What the fuck happened to you?

52:56.341 --> 52:58.259
Don't worry about it.

52:58.927 --> 52:59.761
Bring it?

53:01.513 --> 53:05.517
I brought it.
I'm wondering why you want it.

53:07.477 --> 53:10.397
Why? 'Cause it's mine, that's why.

53:12.607 --> 53:14.526
What the hell are you gonna do with it?

53:14.609 --> 53:17.445
What do you care? Fuck, you don't need it.

53:19.531 --> 53:22.367
Come on, give it to me
before I bash your fucking head in.

54:36.441 --> 54:37.859
Morning.

54:46.493 --> 54:48.536
Where's your mother?

54:48.620 --> 54:50.330
She didn't tell you?

54:50.413 --> 54:51.873
Tell me what?

54:51.956 --> 54:53.875
She went to Aunt Laura's.

54:53.958 --> 54:55.960
Said there was an emergency.

55:01.841 --> 55:04.385
Did you guys have a fight or something?

55:06.638 --> 55:08.848
No, we didn't have a fight.

55:10.183 --> 55:11.643
No.

55:13.603 --> 55:16.231
Let's call Aunt Laura, see what's up.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.240
If you could pick up two
or three of those, it'd be great.

55:25.323 --> 55:26.241
Thank you.

55:35.375 --> 55:36.960
Oh, hey, there, sweetheart.

55:40.922 --> 55:42.840
Hi, the office isn't open yet.

55:43.424 --> 55:45.093
It's okay.

55:45.176 --> 55:48.137
I'm not--
I'm not looking to volunteer anyhow.

55:51.349 --> 55:54.435
Is there something
that I can help you with?

56:06.447 --> 56:09.659
Oh, your brother John did this to me.
In case--

56:09.742 --> 56:11.744
In case you were wondering.

56:13.580 --> 56:15.415
I mean, I just wanted to talk to him,

56:15.498 --> 56:18.751
but you know what an angry motherfucker
he can be, right?

56:20.003 --> 56:23.840
And I figure it's on account
of all the secrets he's keeping.

56:26.676 --> 56:29.637
'Cause we both know
what Danny was doing down here.

56:29.804 --> 56:33.182
We both know how angry
it must have made John.

56:33.266 --> 56:36.728
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-Angry enough to...

56:36.894 --> 56:39.355
Angry enough to want him dead?

56:44.777 --> 56:47.280
Sir, the office is closed.
You need to leave.

56:47.447 --> 56:49.574
Your brother can't control his temper,
clearly.

56:49.741 --> 56:52.327
I mean, if you ask me,
that's gonna be a real liability,

56:52.410 --> 56:54.787
especially with the sheriff's race
coming up and all.

56:54.954 --> 56:58.791
Why don't you go to the police,
tell them whatever the fuck you want to?

56:58.875 --> 57:01.628
Hey, hey, I'm not interested
in sending your brother to jail.

57:04.005 --> 57:07.008
No. Uh-uh.

57:07.675 --> 57:10.094
I just... I just wanna tell you a story

57:10.178 --> 57:13.348
about your brother John
and the Red Reef motel.

57:13.431 --> 57:14.849
And when I'm done,

57:15.016 --> 57:20.104
you decide what it's worth to you
to keep me from telling it again.

58:18.538 --> 58:21.124
When you sent us away,

58:21.207 --> 58:23.126
I remember thinking...

58:23.543 --> 58:26.462
"What if Danny gets violent with John?"

58:26.963 --> 58:28.631
But then I thought,

58:28.715 --> 58:31.843
you got a gun,
you can protect yourself.

58:33.720 --> 58:34.846
No.

58:34.929 --> 58:36.556
No, no, no. John wouldn't do that,

58:36.639 --> 58:41.019
'cause... Danny's the violent one,
not John.

58:42.145 --> 58:44.647
Danny's the scary one.

58:50.028 --> 58:51.904
Because I just...

58:55.366 --> 58:59.662
Because I just could never imagine
that you were capable of...

59:14.135 --> 59:17.305
I'm not gonna ask you the question...

59:18.723 --> 59:22.643
because I can't ever...

59:24.020 --> 59:26.064
hear the answer.

59:49.921 --> 59:51.839
Who else knows?

1:00:02.350 --> 1:00:03.976
Nobody.

1:00:10.191 --> 1:00:12.151
Tell me we're safe.

1:00:15.738 --> 1:00:17.448
We are safe.

1:00:18.533 --> 1:00:21.160
And if the day comes when we're not...

1:00:22.495 --> 1:00:24.413
you will tell me.

1:00:31.212 --> 1:00:33.923
If anything ever happens to you...

1:00:36.134 --> 1:00:37.844
I know nothing.

1:00:40.847 --> 1:00:43.683
Because I gotta be here for our kids.

1:01:14.755 --> 1:01:16.716
What you've done...

1:01:21.679 --> 1:01:24.182
could destroy us.
