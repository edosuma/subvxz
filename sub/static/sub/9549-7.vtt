00:02.422 --> 00:03.787
Step into it,
now. Come on, Petey.

00:03.857 --> 00:04.915
Don't be afraid
of the ball.

00:04.992 --> 00:07.984
Step into one, now. Come
on, kid. Here we go, Petey.

00:08.061 --> 00:12.020
Nice level swing now. Eye on the
ball, Petey. Come on, you can do it.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.465
Here we go.
Level swing.

00:14.602 --> 00:17.503
All right. Hey, that's all
right. Hey, Petey, it's all right.

00:17.572 --> 00:20.200
See the ball. Wait for a
good pitch. Come on, Petey.

00:20.274 --> 00:23.175
Looking good, Martha. You want
to play? We need a center fielder.

00:23.244 --> 00:25.269
You trying to
kill me, Chauncey?

00:25.346 --> 00:27.780
Don't talk like that.
You're gonna outlive us all.

00:27.849 --> 00:29.874
Hey, here we go,
Petey. Come on, now!

00:29.951 --> 00:32.147
Step into one, now.
Meet the ball.

00:36.325 --> 00:37.622
Here we go.
You can do it.

00:37.693 --> 00:41.288
This is your pitch, Petey.
Come on, now. This one's yours.

00:41.797 --> 00:44.129
Meet the ball.
Here we go, Petey.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.297
All that practice about
to pay off. Come on, Petey.

00:56.179 --> 00:57.271
Whoa!

00:58.448 --> 00:59.938
He actually did it!

01:00.016 --> 01:03.918
Attaboy, Petey!
That's how you do it!

01:03.987 --> 01:05.010
Whoo!

01:05.087 --> 01:06.112
Whoo-hoo!

01:06.189 --> 01:08.123
That's how you do it.
Right there, kid.

01:08.191 --> 01:09.180
Nice hit, Petey.
Somebody get that.

01:09.259 --> 01:10.522
Those things cost
four bucks each.

01:10.594 --> 01:13.290
Nice hit, Petey!
Attaboy!

01:13.464 --> 01:14.556
Whoo!

01:36.755 --> 01:38.655
Oh, look at
all this stuff.

01:38.723 --> 01:39.985
I guess we have
to pack it all up.

01:40.058 --> 01:44.119
Let's worry about it after the
funeral. I still can't believe this.

01:44.529 --> 01:47.157
She beat cancer twice
to die like that?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.262
Hit by a baseball.

01:51.938 --> 01:54.031
At least
she didn't suffer.

01:57.276 --> 01:58.903
Oh, her fish.

01:59.312 --> 02:01.177
They must be starving.

02:03.816 --> 02:05.283
Here you go.

02:06.652 --> 02:07.846
I know.

02:08.454 --> 02:09.979
I miss her, too.

02:12.459 --> 02:13.858
What's that?

02:14.161 --> 02:16.959
Bills mostly. I'll
give them to the lawyer.

02:22.836 --> 02:24.098
Bethy...

02:25.772 --> 02:27.296
Bethy, look at this.

02:27.374 --> 02:28.842
What is it?

02:31.713 --> 02:34.045
What is that?
Is that a baseball?

02:36.184 --> 02:40.018
It's postmarked Tuesday. That
was three days before she died.

02:46.995 --> 02:49.362
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:49.431 --> 02:51.956
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

02:54.069 --> 02:56.401
<i>No one seems to care</i>

02:56.472 --> 02:57.496
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:57.573 --> 03:00.201
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

03:00.276 --> 03:02.267
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

03:04.113 --> 03:06.673
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

03:07.417 --> 03:09.817
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

03:09.886 --> 03:10.910
<i>Well, I do</i>

03:10.987 --> 03:14.081
<i>It's amazing</i>

03:14.157 --> 03:15.624
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

03:15.692 --> 03:17.489
<i>'cause I worry
all the time</i>

03:17.561 --> 03:20.724
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

03:20.797 --> 03:22.128
<i>You better pay attention</i>

03:22.199 --> 03:25.032
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

03:25.101 --> 03:28.162
<i>might just kill you</i>

03:28.773 --> 03:30.934
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

03:31.008 --> 03:32.873
<i>But I don't think so</i>

03:32.944 --> 03:35.572
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

03:35.646 --> 03:37.876
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

03:44.878 --> 03:46.743
Don't touch it.
I'm not touching it.

03:46.813 --> 03:48.576
I don't even want
to look at it.

03:48.648 --> 03:50.707
Hey, Monk,
thank you for coming.

03:50.784 --> 03:52.251
We caught a
weird one here.

03:52.318 --> 03:53.649
I mean, this is
off the charts.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.518
What happened?
What did you do here?

03:56.956 --> 03:59.083
Oh, we rearranged
the squad room.

03:59.159 --> 04:00.490
I guess I should
start at the beginning.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.495
On Friday, a woman named
Martha Murphy was killed.

04:03.563 --> 04:05.293
She was hit
by a baseball.

04:05.366 --> 04:07.391
She was power walking past
the Little League field,

04:07.468 --> 04:09.868
when a 12-year-old kid
named Petey Cunningham

04:09.937 --> 04:13.031
knocked one over the fence
and beaned her. Left temple.

04:13.107 --> 04:15.337
I mean, what are the odds,
right? A million-to-one?

04:15.409 --> 04:16.603
A billion-to-one, maybe.

04:16.677 --> 04:19.373
You rearranged the squad room. Why?

04:19.446 --> 04:20.935
It's supposed to
be more efficient.

04:21.015 --> 04:24.213
We've broken it down
into five different units.

04:24.286 --> 04:25.275
It's actually working
out pretty well...

04:25.353 --> 04:27.287
Whatever.
Listen, get this.

04:27.355 --> 04:31.291
Yesterday, Martha's family flies in
from Denver. They go to her house.

04:31.359 --> 04:32.986
They're gonna get
Grandma's affairs in order.

04:33.061 --> 04:35.655
Guess what they found?
It's the darndest thing.

04:35.730 --> 04:37.357
In 30 years of law
enforcement, I've never...

04:37.432 --> 04:39.400
Yeah, here's what
I don't understand.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.765
What was the problem
with the way it was?

04:41.837 --> 04:43.772
The way it was
before was the way...

04:43.840 --> 04:44.829
Monk...

04:44.907 --> 04:45.931
...it's always been.

04:46.008 --> 04:48.238
Monk, I haven't even gotten
to the voodoo stuff yet.

04:48.311 --> 04:50.302
Voodoo? I mean, it's
so random, isn't it?

04:50.379 --> 04:55.316
You got all these arbitrary
formations and... I mean,

04:56.385 --> 04:58.285
who can work like this? It's madness.

04:58.354 --> 05:00.982
Okay! I don't know
what I was thinking.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.954
Randy, let's put everything
back the way it was.

05:04.261 --> 05:06.422
What? You mean right now? For how long?

05:06.496 --> 05:08.123
Until Monk dies.

05:09.032 --> 05:10.397
You heard
the Captain.

05:10.467 --> 05:13.368
Let's move the desks
back the way they were.

05:13.537 --> 05:14.936
Let's go, Sergeant.

05:15.272 --> 05:17.240
Hey, Ralph, give me a
hand with this one here.

05:18.709 --> 05:19.698
That's yours.

05:19.776 --> 05:21.107
Captain, yeah.
Let me just grab that there.

05:21.178 --> 05:25.138
Okay, hey, guys, let's go, let's
go, let's go. We don't have all day.

05:25.216 --> 05:26.615
Is that a gap?
Thank you.

05:31.556 --> 05:33.353
There we go.
There we go.

05:35.393 --> 05:37.088
All right, whoa!

05:37.362 --> 05:38.693
Chair!

05:43.869 --> 05:46.133
Okay? Yeah, that one's a little off.

05:47.339 --> 05:49.603
It's askew. You know,
kind of straight...

05:50.342 --> 05:51.866
Okay, well, now, that's
too far. You went too...

05:51.944 --> 05:53.138
Monk!

05:53.512 --> 05:55.446
That's the way it was.

05:55.514 --> 05:57.038
Yeah, almost.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.482
So what did you
find at her house?

06:00.553 --> 06:01.952
Over here.

06:05.258 --> 06:06.247
Voodoo doll.

06:06.326 --> 06:08.988
Yeah, we've already traced
it from a store in The Haight,

06:09.062 --> 06:11.155
Reverend Jorgensen's
Voodoo Boutique.

06:11.231 --> 06:13.358
Just sent Fenderman and
Kramer up there to take a look.

06:13.433 --> 06:16.596
It was postmarked
last Tuesday in Nob Hill.

06:16.670 --> 06:20.698
Checked with post office.
The postmark is 100% legit.

06:20.775 --> 06:25.371
So here's what we have. The doll was
mailed three days before she died.

06:26.514 --> 06:29.711
And I'm looking at it,
but it's just not possible.

06:37.925 --> 06:39.917
Wait a minute.

06:40.963 --> 06:42.157
What?

06:56.311 --> 06:58.803
I'm sorry. Something about voodoo?

07:15.932 --> 07:16.921
She was exercising?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.334
Yes, sir. Power walker,
came by every afternoon.

07:20.637 --> 07:22.298
At the same time?

07:22.373 --> 07:24.136
Varied, 3:30, 4:00.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.403
So she was
walking along here.

07:26.477 --> 07:28.672
The ball came
over the fence.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.148
Are there a lot of balls
hit over the wall?

07:32.216 --> 07:34.582
Not really. Every
now and then, maybe.

07:34.651 --> 07:36.243
It was a hell
of a hit, actually.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.686
I mean, too bad
about Mrs. Murphy,

07:37.756 --> 07:39.223
but Petey really
got all of it,

07:39.290 --> 07:40.552
'cause you kept
your eye on the ball.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.183
You listened to me,
waited for your pitch.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.125
Thanks.
Beautiful hit.

07:44.195 --> 07:46.595
I mean, until the,
uh, you know.

07:47.465 --> 07:48.693
Right.

07:51.069 --> 07:52.627
Hi, Petey.
Hey!

07:53.004 --> 07:55.734
Did you know
Mrs. Murphy?

07:55.807 --> 07:57.139
No, sir.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.906
Am I going to jail?

08:00.346 --> 08:02.075
Probably not.

08:05.217 --> 08:07.276
So what do you think?
Act of God, right?

08:07.353 --> 08:08.377
I don't know.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.979
Yeah, so how do you
explain the doll?

08:11.057 --> 08:13.821
Well, I can't
explain it yet.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.861
Well, you want me to start
rounding up witch doctors?

08:15.928 --> 08:17.089
Yeah.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.256
That'd probably make a
hell of a lineup, though.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.423
You know what,
it's not funny.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.058
I used to laugh
about it, too.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.500
About what?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.601
Voodoo, black magic.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.006
Wait, you can't actually
believe in that stuff.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.909
Somebody predicted that poor
woman would get hit by a baseball

08:32.979 --> 08:35.345
three days before it happened.
How would you explain it?

08:35.414 --> 08:36.644
Well...

08:36.717 --> 08:38.446
I mean...

08:38.919 --> 08:39.943
Maybe...

08:40.020 --> 08:41.352
Well, wait,
I got it.

08:41.422 --> 08:43.549
Well, well, she walked
by here every day, right?

08:43.624 --> 08:46.650
Yeah. So maybe the killer
was waiting back here,

08:46.727 --> 08:48.786
behind this tree
with a baseball gun.

08:48.863 --> 08:50.990
A baseball gun?
There's no such thing.

08:51.065 --> 08:52.498
Yeah, but there are
pitching machines.

08:52.567 --> 08:53.693
Yeah.

08:53.768 --> 08:56.169
Okay, so how would
your baseball-gun killer...

08:56.238 --> 08:57.933
Oh, that's a good name
for him, by the way.

08:58.006 --> 09:00.270
How would he know someone
would hit a home run

09:00.342 --> 09:01.707
at exactly that moment?

09:01.777 --> 09:04.803
And what happened
to the other baseball?

09:04.880 --> 09:06.609
The other baseball.

09:06.748 --> 09:09.740
It's voodoo. It's real,
and it kills people.

09:10.619 --> 09:14.716
Okay, how about this? She had an
insurance policy with a no-suicide clause.

09:14.791 --> 09:16.315
So she had to make it
look like an accident.

09:16.392 --> 09:18.724
She came here, she waited
for a home run to be hit.

09:18.795 --> 09:21.730
She grabs the ball and
cracks her own cranium.

09:23.099 --> 09:26.034
With a baseball? She
fractured her cranium?

09:26.336 --> 09:27.598
Yeah.

09:27.937 --> 09:29.700
Was she that strong?

09:33.443 --> 09:35.571
She exercised.
She exercised.

09:35.646 --> 09:37.841
I think voodoo's looking
better and better.

09:37.915 --> 09:40.315
Okay, let's be rational here. Yeah.

09:40.384 --> 09:45.549
We live in the real world. It is governed
by science, physics, laws of nature.

09:45.856 --> 09:51.726
There is always, always a non-voodoo
explanation for everything.

09:51.795 --> 09:53.593
Mmm-hmm,
except voodoo.

09:53.665 --> 09:54.996
Disher.

09:55.066 --> 09:56.260
I don't understand.

09:56.334 --> 09:59.360
Did some gypsy put a curse
on you when you were a child?

09:59.437 --> 10:00.631
I don't want to
talk about it.

10:00.705 --> 10:02.468
We'll be
right there.

10:02.541 --> 10:04.202
Randy, what is it?

10:04.609 --> 10:06.304
It's another doll.

10:10.015 --> 10:11.676
Hey.
Hi, Lieutenant.

10:11.750 --> 10:12.843
Is this
a crime scene?

10:12.919 --> 10:14.284
I don't know.
I think so.

10:14.353 --> 10:15.513
I don't know what the hell it is.

10:15.588 --> 10:17.453
Ed, just tell him
what you told me.

10:17.523 --> 10:19.081
Okay, remember this
a couple of days ago?

10:19.158 --> 10:22.127
There was thunder and
lightning. The guy kept golfing.

10:22.195 --> 10:24.186
Remember you said
what a jerk the guy was,

10:24.263 --> 10:26.493
how he single-handedly
proved Darwin's theory?

10:26.566 --> 10:27.590
What about it?

10:27.667 --> 10:30.693
Well, the guy's name is Ralph
Farris, okay? This is his place.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.363
He doesn't have
any family, right?

10:32.439 --> 10:36.034
So this morning, the super comes
in to start packing up and...

10:36.109 --> 10:37.474
And what?

10:37.544 --> 10:38.841
And this.

10:42.015 --> 10:44.347
Postmarked a week
ago. Nob Hill.

10:49.256 --> 10:51.247
Well, go ahead
and open it.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.186
No, you can
open it, sir.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.161
I'll open it.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.828
Although, technically,
I am just a consultant.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.704
Sergeant,
you're not helping.

11:06.774 --> 11:08.139
Yes, sir.

11:08.676 --> 11:10.200
I'll open it.

11:18.854 --> 11:20.947
It's another doll,
isn't it?

11:23.325 --> 11:25.623
And there's a lightning
bolt coming out of its head?

11:25.694 --> 11:27.389
No, it's his neck.

11:32.836 --> 11:34.667
No, you're right.
It's his head.

11:34.738 --> 11:36.535
Now do you
believe me?

11:59.548 --> 12:00.981
Hi!
Hey, whoa, whoa.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.985
What time is it?
It's not 8:00, is it?

12:04.053 --> 12:06.453
I have a surprise, a good
surprise. It's a good thing.

12:06.522 --> 12:08.547
We're going away.
We're going on vacation.

12:08.624 --> 12:09.956
No, thank you.

12:10.027 --> 12:12.621
Mr. Monk, you've been working
too hard. You need a break.

12:12.696 --> 12:13.958
I already made
a reservation.

12:14.031 --> 12:16.329
It's a five-star resort
in Santa Barbara.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.200
Five stars means immaculate.
Oh, here's the brochure.

12:21.605 --> 12:23.266
We don't have to fly.
It's right down the coast.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.740
And get this, your room
is on the 10th floor.

12:25.809 --> 12:27.800
Room 1010,
how about that?

12:27.878 --> 12:30.177
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We talked about this.

12:30.248 --> 12:31.977
I don't really
do vacations.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.610
Did I mention it's my treat?
It won't cost you a nickel.

12:34.686 --> 12:36.449
Room 1010, huh?

12:36.521 --> 12:37.647
What about Julie?

12:37.722 --> 12:39.747
Julie's still on the
internship in Washington.

12:39.824 --> 12:40.916
So...

12:41.025 --> 12:43.016
It's just you
and me, boss!

12:43.094 --> 12:44.561
You ready?
Here we go!

12:44.629 --> 12:46.893
Wait a second. Now, you
mean? Right, right now?

12:46.965 --> 12:47.990
Yeah, that's
the fun of it.

12:48.067 --> 12:50.262
We just get up and
go. We're fancy-free!

12:50.336 --> 12:52.167
We're fancy-free?
Yeah!

12:52.237 --> 12:53.898
Is that what
you just said?

12:53.973 --> 12:56.407
How can I leave? I'm still
working on the voodoo thing.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.375
Mr. Monk, they won't even
miss you. It'll be fine.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.810
Well, I have to call
the Captain and...

13:00.879 --> 13:02.141
No, no, no, no.
I'll call the Captain.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.444
Um, I'll do that.
You just get your coat.

13:04.516 --> 13:05.608
Okay?

13:09.656 --> 13:11.783
Captain Stottlemeyer,
please.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.683
Hi, it's Natalie.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.593
I'm taking Mr. Monk out of
town for a couple of days.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.961
Yeah, I agree. He needs a break.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.522
So don't even
bother calling.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.664
Get the coat.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.734
I will. I will, as soon as we get back.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.473
Okay.
All right, bye.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.275
He wants us to take
a lot of pictures.

13:35.349 --> 13:37.283
That phone's unplugged.

13:37.585 --> 13:38.643
Pardon me?

13:38.719 --> 13:41.313
It's not plugged in.
There's the cord.

13:42.223 --> 13:44.248
Are you calling me a liar?

13:44.658 --> 13:45.819
It's not plugged in.

13:45.894 --> 13:47.088
So you're calling me
a liar?

13:47.162 --> 13:49.130
I don't know
what to say.

13:49.664 --> 13:51.427
It's not
plugged in.

14:01.843 --> 14:04.937
Natalie, what is going
on? Are you in trouble?

14:05.013 --> 14:07.949
It's this case, Mr. Monk.
I hate this case.

14:08.184 --> 14:11.517
What, the...
Two voodoo dolls.

14:11.587 --> 14:12.815
Three.

14:13.556 --> 14:15.786
The Captain called
an hour ago.

14:17.226 --> 14:18.625
Excuse me?

14:18.828 --> 14:20.056
Are you in charge?

14:20.129 --> 14:22.029
Yes, ma'am.
We both are.

14:23.466 --> 14:24.832
Mostly him.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.098
It wasn't his heart.

14:27.938 --> 14:29.565
It was that doll.

14:30.574 --> 14:32.701
That voodoo doll
killed him.

14:32.876 --> 14:34.275
Yes. Miss...

14:34.611 --> 14:37.375
Um, Dilworth, Angeline
Dilworth. He was my uncle.

14:37.448 --> 14:42.511
Ms. Dilworth, um, I need you
to take a deep breath, okay?

14:42.586 --> 14:44.578
Can you
do that for me?

14:44.656 --> 14:45.645
Yeah.

15:00.472 --> 15:02.702
Are you okay? Mr. Monk,
I'm gonna wait out here.

15:02.774 --> 15:04.902
Oh, Natalie, you're
being ridiculous.

15:04.977 --> 15:07.172
Mr. Monk, I can't go in. I'm sorry.

15:07.246 --> 15:11.444
Yeah, I hate to mention this,
but it is technically your job.

15:11.951 --> 15:15.352
Then fire me. I'm not going to fire you.

15:15.588 --> 15:17.920
Just don't go anywhere.
You're my ride home.

15:17.990 --> 15:19.014
I hate this case.

15:19.091 --> 15:23.188
Yes, you've made that
clear. You hate this case.

15:24.331 --> 15:27.789
I was upstairs. I heard him
scream. I came back down.

15:27.868 --> 15:31.269
I guess he had opened the
mail, and he just collapsed.

15:32.873 --> 15:34.841
I'm an ER nurse.
I tried everything.

15:34.908 --> 15:38.810
I did cardiocerebral
resuscitation. And I just...

15:38.879 --> 15:40.744
It was too late,
and...

15:41.148 --> 15:43.174
He was just gone.

15:44.185 --> 15:47.018
Well, we found these on the
kitchen counter. Nitroglycerine.

15:47.088 --> 15:49.079
Yeah, he had a bad heart.

15:49.190 --> 15:50.680
He'd been sick
for a long time.

15:50.758 --> 15:53.158
That's why I moved
back, to help.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.621
I was the only
family he had.

15:55.930 --> 15:58.956
Captain, we're all done
here. Can I take him?

15:59.734 --> 16:04.229
Uh, no. Uh... I want Monk to have
a look at him. Where the hell is he?

16:04.306 --> 16:05.432
I don't know.

16:08.844 --> 16:11.278
Hey, there you are.
Where the hell you been?

16:11.346 --> 16:12.574
I called two hours ago.

16:12.648 --> 16:13.842
It's Natalie.

16:13.916 --> 16:15.679
She didn't even
give me the message.

16:15.751 --> 16:18.447
She's all twisted up
about this case.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.285
She's outside right now.
She won't come in.

16:21.357 --> 16:23.291
Now, wait a minute. Let
me get my head around this.

16:23.359 --> 16:25.759
You are the level-headed,
brave one now?

16:25.828 --> 16:27.728
She's shaking her head.

16:27.997 --> 16:31.558
It's this voodoo stuff.
She believes it.

16:31.634 --> 16:33.363
Yeah, I don't think
she's coming in.

16:33.436 --> 16:35.404
I can't really
blame her.

16:35.705 --> 16:37.400
We've all
got the heebie-jeebies.

16:37.473 --> 16:39.703
Say hello to doll
number three.

16:40.911 --> 16:42.538
Heart attack.
Yep.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.641
Victim number three,
Robert Boyd, 64 years old.

16:46.717 --> 16:48.548
Guy was a big fish. He
owned Boyd Teletronics.

16:48.619 --> 16:50.382
You know, the
cell phone company?

16:50.454 --> 16:52.979
So, according to his
niece, Angeline Dilworth,

16:53.057 --> 16:55.958
that's her right over there,
he's had a bad ticker for years.

16:56.026 --> 16:58.221
She's been worried about him,
especially this last week.

16:58.295 --> 16:59.284
Why is that?

16:59.363 --> 17:01.832
Apparently, he was obsessed
with the voodoo killings.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.765
He was watching the
news, following the case.

17:03.835 --> 17:05.358
He's real superstitious.

17:05.436 --> 17:06.733
Yeah, so I see.

17:06.805 --> 17:09.535
So he goes to collect the
mail, including this box.

17:09.608 --> 17:10.801
Yeah, same
as the others.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.844
Postmarked three days
ago, no return address.

17:13.912 --> 17:15.811
He opens the box,
sees the doll.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.508
Bob's your uncle,
his heart just stops.

17:19.452 --> 17:21.420
"Bob's your uncle"?

17:21.487 --> 17:23.454
That doesn't
sound right.

17:23.556 --> 17:26.047
Well, yeah. Well, Bob was her uncle...

17:26.125 --> 17:28.025
Uncle Robert.

17:28.828 --> 17:30.056
Yeah, right, but
that doesn't matter.

17:30.129 --> 17:31.790
Excuse me. It's a figure of speech.

17:31.864 --> 17:32.990
A figure of
whose speech?

17:33.065 --> 17:34.054
Well, it's
kind of ironic.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.464
I've never heard...
His name is Robert...

17:35.534 --> 17:37.001
No, I know. No, no, back up a second.

17:37.069 --> 17:38.127
I've never heard "Bob's
your uncle" before.

17:38.204 --> 17:39.229
You've never heard
"Bob's your uncle"? No.

17:39.306 --> 17:40.295
Have you been
to Australia?

17:40.374 --> 17:42.205
No, I've never
been to Australia.

17:42.276 --> 17:44.767
Bob's your uncle, mate.
Didgeridoo.

17:44.845 --> 17:46.836
Have you been? Have
you been to Australia?

17:46.913 --> 17:48.005
No.

17:48.482 --> 17:50.712
Did you, like,
see a movie, like...

17:50.784 --> 17:52.411
Like, "That's a knife,
mate. "

17:52.486 --> 17:53.544
Is that...

17:55.355 --> 17:56.822
Hey, Natalie.

18:04.899 --> 18:06.366
Is there a problem?

18:06.434 --> 18:08.334
Um, it's upside down.

18:09.304 --> 18:10.566
What is?

18:11.372 --> 18:13.966
The horseshoe. It's
supposed to point up,

18:14.042 --> 18:16.476
so the good luck
stays in the shoe.

18:16.844 --> 18:20.679
He was a superstitious guy. I'm
surprised he didn't know that.

18:20.749 --> 18:23.081
Maybe that's why
it didn't work.

18:23.786 --> 18:25.651
Uh, we haven't met.
I'm Adrian Monk.

18:25.721 --> 18:26.915
Monk.

18:27.222 --> 18:30.282
I've heard of you. You're
that famous detective.

18:30.926 --> 18:32.325
I'm Angeline Dilworth.

18:32.394 --> 18:34.385
Right, I understand you were
here alone when it happened.

18:34.463 --> 18:35.452
That's right.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.830
Did your uncle know
the other victims?

18:37.901 --> 18:40.267
Martha Murphy
or Ralph Farris?

18:41.104 --> 18:42.435
No.
No.

18:42.505 --> 18:46.669
Monk, Natalie just called from
the driveway. She wants to go home.

18:46.743 --> 18:47.903
Now?

18:47.977 --> 18:50.639
Yep, she's in pretty
bad shape. I can tell.

18:50.714 --> 18:51.874
You'd better
take care of her.

18:51.948 --> 18:53.415
What can I do?

18:54.117 --> 18:56.450
Well, you've seen normal
people, sensitive people,

18:56.520 --> 18:58.920
taking care of each
other. Do what they do.

18:58.989 --> 19:00.513
Call you later.

19:03.027 --> 19:04.153
Um...

19:07.631 --> 19:09.963
I'm sorry
about your uncle.

19:22.848 --> 19:26.682
Whoa, look at this place. It's
like Halloween the year round.

19:30.021 --> 19:31.784
Lucky bath crystals.

19:31.857 --> 19:33.484
Incense powder.

19:35.060 --> 19:36.528
Money powder.

19:36.763 --> 19:39.527
"Guaranteed to cure
all financial woes. "

19:39.599 --> 19:40.691
Well, you should buy it.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.530
Can't afford it.

19:54.013 --> 19:55.504
"Cupid's Arrow. "

19:56.483 --> 19:58.212
It's a love potion.

20:10.464 --> 20:11.556
What?

20:11.832 --> 20:13.561
It's not working.

20:13.634 --> 20:14.829
Good.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.066
Are these the same voodoo
dolls from the news?

20:22.143 --> 20:24.236
Be very careful
with that.

20:24.312 --> 20:26.712
That's a very
powerful instrument.

20:26.981 --> 20:28.073
Don't tell him
your real name.

20:28.149 --> 20:30.413
Why not?
Just to be safe.

20:31.719 --> 20:32.708
The dolls.

20:32.787 --> 20:33.777
Right.

20:33.856 --> 20:35.517
Reverend Jorgensen.

20:35.591 --> 20:36.990
My name is
Leland Stottlemeyer.

20:37.059 --> 20:38.720
So is mine. Uh, we'd like to ask you

20:38.794 --> 20:41.456
a couple of questions
about your merchandise.

20:41.530 --> 20:43.657
Uh, we're gonna
be a while here.

20:43.732 --> 20:45.666
Thank you.
Thank you.

20:45.734 --> 20:49.363
I've been talking to you guys
all week, and I'm all talked out.

20:49.438 --> 20:53.466
Well, that's unfortunate, because
there was another incident, yesterday.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.977
Did you, uh,
sell this doll?

20:56.379 --> 20:58.506
Probably.
Looks like mine.

20:58.915 --> 21:02.351
Well, you're three for three, because
all three dolls came from your shop.

21:02.419 --> 21:05.786
Give me a break. I can't be
responsible for how my dolls are used.

21:05.856 --> 21:08.256
Listen, did you take out
this advertisement?

21:08.325 --> 21:10.816
What if I did?
It's no big deal.

21:11.528 --> 21:12.928
Could be a motive.

21:12.997 --> 21:14.760
A motive?
Publicity.

21:14.832 --> 21:15.856
Seem to be
pretty busy here.

21:15.933 --> 21:19.096
You think I killed all
those people for publicity?

21:19.604 --> 21:21.970
How? How did
I do that?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.840
We don't know.
We don't know yet.

21:25.142 --> 21:26.871
Are we done here?

21:27.111 --> 21:29.011
Um, yeah, we're done.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.647
If you think
of anything else,

21:31.717 --> 21:35.016
please don't hesitate to
call me or call Lieutenant...

21:35.087 --> 21:36.850
Stottlemeyer.
Leland Stottlemeyer.

21:40.526 --> 21:42.153
Natalie, it's me.

21:45.197 --> 21:46.425
Natalie.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.259
Hello?

21:50.135 --> 21:51.194
Hey.

21:51.404 --> 21:54.100
Feeling better?

21:55.642 --> 21:58.338
Great, listen, I have a favor to ask.

21:58.411 --> 22:01.005
I, uh... I don't know what's going
on with you and all this voodoo stuff,

22:01.080 --> 22:04.106
but here's the thing. You
cannot be the unstable one.

22:04.183 --> 22:06.981
I cannot take care
of you, Natalie.

22:07.053 --> 22:11.354
This morning I spent six hours
organizing my cereal boxes.

22:11.425 --> 22:15.555
I have to be honest. I cannot
function like this. Do you understand?

22:17.798 --> 22:19.026
Natalie?

22:21.602 --> 22:22.694
What?

22:53.536 --> 22:54.730
Okay.

22:55.271 --> 22:56.533
I got it.

22:57.406 --> 22:59.567
They'll be here
in five minutes.

22:59.642 --> 23:01.769
Was there anything
else in the box?

23:01.844 --> 23:03.971
Natalie,
when did it arrive?

23:07.116 --> 23:09.517
The postmark says
Pacific Heights.

23:09.886 --> 23:11.717
Do you know anybody
in Pacific Heights?

23:11.788 --> 23:12.880
No.

23:15.158 --> 23:18.559
They misspelled your
name. T- E-A-G-E-R.

23:18.629 --> 23:19.857
Who spells your
name like that?

23:19.930 --> 23:21.227
The Devil.

23:21.298 --> 23:22.697
Excuse me?

23:22.966 --> 23:24.934
The head's been cut off.

23:25.402 --> 23:28.429
That's what it means. I'm...
I'm gonna be decapitated.

23:28.506 --> 23:31.839
No. It doesn't
mean anything.

23:31.909 --> 23:36.642
I mean, it could've broken
off in shipping, right?

23:37.782 --> 23:39.511
Oh, no.
You're right.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.212
It has been cut with
some kind of scalpel.

23:42.286 --> 23:44.413
What's gonna
happen to Julie?

23:46.157 --> 23:47.989
Hey...
Look at me.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.024
Natalie, look at me.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.725
All right, this is me talking.
Nothing is going to happen.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.531
I don't know what's going
on here, but it isn't hoodoo

23:59.138 --> 24:00.901
and it isn't voodoo.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.531
Someone is just
trying to scare you.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.404
Voodoo isn't real.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.174
Okay? It's a fairy tale.

24:08.248 --> 24:12.116
You've been asking me all week
how can I believe in this stuff?

24:13.553 --> 24:17.853
When Mitch first started his
tour, I lived in South Carolina.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.358
We had a little
apartment off base.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.695
There was this woman
who lived down the hall,

24:22.762 --> 24:24.093
Ms. Ayida.

24:24.264 --> 24:26.699
She claimed to be
a voodoo priestess.

24:26.767 --> 24:29.167
She said that
Mitch was in danger.

24:29.737 --> 24:31.728
She told me
to warn him.

24:31.806 --> 24:34.570
I didn't say anything.
I didn't warn him.

24:35.242 --> 24:36.675
I...

24:36.744 --> 24:39.178
I guess I didn't
take it seriously.

24:40.815 --> 24:43.010
The next day,
he was shot down.

24:43.584 --> 24:45.484
And you blame
yourself?

24:46.621 --> 24:49.021
It's not a fairy tale, Mr. Monk.

24:50.892 --> 24:52.086
Natalie!

24:53.695 --> 24:55.356
We got your call.

25:49.521 --> 25:51.716
Hey, good morning.
How'd you sleep?

25:51.790 --> 25:53.155
I didn't.

25:53.458 --> 25:56.154
Do you know anything
about ceiling fans?

25:56.361 --> 25:58.659
Like what? Do they ever come off?

25:58.730 --> 25:59.958
There's one
in my bedroom.

26:00.031 --> 26:02.659
I swear it was whispering
my name all night.

26:02.734 --> 26:03.793
Try the couch.

26:03.869 --> 26:06.895
It doesn't matter. I'm never
sleeping again. Where's Mr. Monk?

26:06.972 --> 26:09.167
He's down at the
station with the Captain.

26:09.241 --> 26:11.937
Hey, we've got 40 guys
on the case, Nat.

26:12.511 --> 26:13.535
What are you
looking for?

26:13.612 --> 26:14.601
A knife.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.377
I threw them out. The blender,
too, and the hedge clippers.

26:20.519 --> 26:21.781
Got it.

26:24.825 --> 26:27.157
Listen, everything's
gonna be fine.

26:27.227 --> 26:29.457
We're gonna put you in a safe
house this afternoon, okay?

26:29.529 --> 26:31.156
Randy, I'm not leaving.

26:31.231 --> 26:32.562
I'm never leaving
this house again.

26:32.632 --> 26:33.724
You're gonna
have armed guards.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.325
It's already been
scheduled, Natalie.

26:37.904 --> 26:39.235
Randy...

26:40.574 --> 26:41.939
The cookie.

26:46.914 --> 26:48.142
Sorry.

26:49.383 --> 26:52.147
Doesn't matter. I could have the
whole Sixth Fleet guarding me.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.245
Natalie, it's
just a doll.

26:54.322 --> 26:58.588
You really don't believe
in it? Witchcraft, voodoo?

26:58.693 --> 27:01.287
I'm a Pisces.
We're not superstitious.

27:01.797 --> 27:03.526
Where's your milk?

27:05.634 --> 27:07.226
Oh, no,
no, no, no.

27:09.471 --> 27:11.939
<i>Do you understand me?
Do not touch la muñeca.</i>

27:12.007 --> 27:14.032
Don't touch
anything, okay?

27:14.109 --> 27:16.577
Yeah, we'll have an
officer there in 20 minutes.

27:16.645 --> 27:18.806
I told the mayor
not to go public.

27:18.881 --> 27:20.940
Now we got 50
copycats out there.

27:21.016 --> 27:23.042
Half the town is getting
voodoo dolls in the mail,

27:23.119 --> 27:25.519
and all of them want a
squad car in their driveway.

27:25.588 --> 27:29.456
But these are the four,
the only four that count.

27:30.660 --> 27:32.924
The same
wrapping paper,

27:32.996 --> 27:35.021
the same handwriting,
it's strange.

27:35.098 --> 27:37.862
He doesn't write
the address on the box.

27:38.201 --> 27:39.998
He uses these labels.

27:40.169 --> 27:42.035
What does
that tell us?

27:42.940 --> 27:45.067
I don't know. I don't... I don't know.

27:46.477 --> 27:48.001
It's the damndest
thing, right?

27:48.078 --> 27:50.342
What about the victims?
Is there any connection?

27:50.414 --> 27:53.383
No. No. The FBI's been
running their names all day.

27:53.450 --> 27:55.611
There's no connection. And,
oh, here's some more bad news.

27:55.686 --> 27:58.712
Our number-one suspect,
our only suspect,

27:59.423 --> 28:01.051
is not gonna fly.

28:01.459 --> 28:03.654
Huh, the guy who was
selling all the dolls.

28:03.728 --> 28:07.357
Reverend Jorgensen. He's got
an alibi for all three victims.

28:07.432 --> 28:09.024
And now Natalie.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.863
Now Natalie.

28:11.636 --> 28:12.625
How's she doing?

28:12.704 --> 28:14.831
Ah, she's
scared to death.

28:15.607 --> 28:18.735
I just talked to Randy. She hasn't
gotten off the couch all day.

28:18.810 --> 28:23.271
Now he says she's wearing one of those
plastic dog funnels around her neck.

28:23.849 --> 28:25.077
Well, that can't be good.

28:25.151 --> 28:28.018
We have got
to do something.

28:28.354 --> 28:30.788
She's going to
completely unravel.

28:31.190 --> 28:33.886
It would take me
forever to replace her.

28:36.262 --> 28:39.562
But, of course, that's not
the most important thing.

28:40.701 --> 28:42.464
This isn't about me.

28:42.970 --> 28:45.996
You know, Monk, if she really
does take this crap seriously,

28:46.073 --> 28:48.132
there is something
we can do.

29:09.454 --> 29:10.580
Don't answer it.
Don't answer it!

29:10.655 --> 29:12.282
Okay, it's okay.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.085
I know who it is.

29:16.796 --> 29:17.990
It's...

29:30.276 --> 29:32.301
Thank you
for coming.

29:33.179 --> 29:35.044
Right this way.

29:38.418 --> 29:39.680
Natalie...

29:41.254 --> 29:43.245
This is Hadley Jorgensen.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.258
Reverend Jorgensen.

29:48.128 --> 29:49.755
Hello, Natalie.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.425
Captain Stottlemeyer
told me you had a problem.

29:54.935 --> 29:56.836
He thought
I could help.

29:57.672 --> 29:59.697
Help? How?

30:00.208 --> 30:02.506
Sister, you have
been cursed.

30:03.144 --> 30:07.478
And without getting too technical,
I'm here to un-curse you.

30:07.682 --> 30:10.207
And Mr. Monk
is going to help.

30:11.085 --> 30:12.177
I am?

30:12.253 --> 30:15.655
I've taken the liberty of
making a replica of the dolls,

30:15.724 --> 30:17.487
working from photos.

30:20.195 --> 30:22.186
Does this look
about right?

30:27.135 --> 30:28.295
Oh, God!

30:31.707 --> 30:33.265
How do you know
this will work?

30:33.342 --> 30:35.607
Sister, I guarantee it.

30:36.212 --> 30:38.077
You shall be cleansed.

31:10.180 --> 31:13.173
Can't you just fast-forward
and get to the end?

31:13.551 --> 31:14.677
No.

31:25.530 --> 31:26.827
Uh...

31:26.898 --> 31:28.695
What is that?

31:28.767 --> 31:31.463
It's an herb.
It's called asafetida.

31:31.536 --> 31:32.799
Mmm-hmm.

31:33.139 --> 31:35.733
Also known as
"Devil's dung. "

31:41.914 --> 31:43.108
Okay, I think
we're done here.

31:43.182 --> 31:44.308
Thank you very much
for coming, though.

31:44.383 --> 31:46.408
No, no, no, Mr. Monk,
please let him finish.

31:46.485 --> 31:48.043
Yes, it's almost ready.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.678
What is it?

31:49.755 --> 31:51.849
It's my own
original recipe.

31:52.125 --> 31:56.459
Mr. Monk, if you would be so
kind as to reattach its head.

31:56.530 --> 31:58.088
Mmm-hmm.

31:58.165 --> 31:59.462
Here's some adhesive.

31:59.533 --> 32:00.830
Mmm, yeah.

32:04.171 --> 32:05.832
Some witchgrass,

32:08.942 --> 32:10.466
some coltsfoot.

32:13.648 --> 32:15.878
Ah! Mandrake root.

32:21.956 --> 32:23.423
Smidgen more.

32:26.260 --> 32:27.852
All I need now
is the doll.

32:27.929 --> 32:29.556
One second.

32:30.331 --> 32:32.027
It doesn't
have to be perfect.

32:32.101 --> 32:33.591
Almost done.

32:34.403 --> 32:36.371
It's symbolic, really.

32:36.572 --> 32:38.062
There we go.

32:41.610 --> 32:44.238
The forces of darkness
are gathering.

32:44.446 --> 32:46.038
Hold on.

32:50.954 --> 32:53.047
It doesn't have
to be perfect!

32:55.125 --> 32:56.854
Ah.
Wait a second.

32:57.327 --> 32:58.555
It doesn't have
to be perfect.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.323
One second,
almost done.

33:00.397 --> 33:01.796
Doesn't...

33:04.968 --> 33:05.992
Wait one second...

33:06.069 --> 33:07.297
Mr. Monk, please,
just let him finish!

33:07.370 --> 33:08.394
Hold on.

33:08.471 --> 33:10.599
She's suffering,
Mr. Monk!

33:11.075 --> 33:13.441
It doesn't have
to be... Okay!

33:13.511 --> 33:15.536
Yeah, that's close enough.

33:18.649 --> 33:20.241
The potion is ready.

33:20.317 --> 33:21.944
Potion's ready.

33:29.127 --> 33:31.459
Cleanse this body.

33:32.898 --> 33:35.458
Release its soul.

33:37.235 --> 33:39.965
Expel its darkness.

33:41.573 --> 33:44.269
Make her whole.

33:46.044 --> 33:47.705
What did you do?

33:48.013 --> 33:50.039
What?
Did you drink that?

33:50.116 --> 33:51.174
Yeah, you said
it was ready.

33:51.250 --> 33:54.048
You're supposed to rub it on
your neck! What? Are you mental?

33:54.120 --> 33:56.418
What do we do?
What do we do?

33:56.489 --> 33:58.787
What? 911. 911!
911! 911! 911!

33:58.858 --> 34:00.951
Is that another chant?

34:01.027 --> 34:03.723
Now!
Call 911.

34:10.237 --> 34:11.829
How do you feel?

34:11.905 --> 34:12.929
God, it hurts.

34:13.005 --> 34:15.167
I know, I know.
I know, just hang on.

34:15.242 --> 34:16.937
Hang on, they should
be here any...

34:17.010 --> 34:18.476
And they're here.
Here they are.

34:18.545 --> 34:19.773
Maybe we should
induce vomiting.

34:19.847 --> 34:22.543
No! No. No,
no, no, no, no.

34:22.616 --> 34:25.608
Let's call that
"plan never do. "

34:26.386 --> 34:29.049
We got a call. Somebody
OD'd? Yeah, over here.

34:31.159 --> 34:32.217
What did she take?

34:32.293 --> 34:34.284
An anti-hex potion,
about 15 ingredients.

34:34.362 --> 34:35.829
She wasn't supposed to drink it.

34:37.098 --> 34:38.292
Oh, hello.

34:38.366 --> 34:39.355
Hi.

34:39.434 --> 34:40.992
Oh, Angeline, right?

34:41.069 --> 34:42.400
Mr. Monk, small world.

34:42.469 --> 34:44.495
I didn't
know you were a paramedic.

34:44.572 --> 34:45.596
Oh, I didn't
mention that?

34:45.672 --> 34:47.335
No, no, you didn't.

34:47.409 --> 34:48.706
What was in it,
specifically?

34:48.777 --> 34:51.678
Nothing that unusual. Some
alkanet root, some deer tongue,

34:51.746 --> 34:54.341
root bark, motherwort,
graveyard dirt.

34:54.416 --> 34:56.748
What wasn't in it? Let's
just write all this down.

34:56.819 --> 34:57.979
Mmm.

34:58.053 --> 34:59.384
I'll go with you.

34:59.455 --> 35:02.015
I'm sorry,
there's no room.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.924
You can ride with me,
if you don't mind the mess.

35:18.542 --> 35:20.772
You allergic
to any medication?

35:21.011 --> 35:22.239
No.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.909
You were there.
You were a witness.

35:26.350 --> 35:29.683
I said the potion was ready.
I never said to drink it.

35:29.754 --> 35:31.415
That's not voodoo.
That's voo-don't.

35:31.489 --> 35:33.013
What is all
this stuff?

35:33.090 --> 35:34.387
It's gonna get us killed!

35:34.458 --> 35:35.686
They're my
good-luck charms!

35:40.631 --> 35:42.360
It's a small world.

35:43.701 --> 35:45.101
Excuse me?

35:45.370 --> 35:47.838
The paramedic,
I've met her before.

35:48.307 --> 35:50.502
She was Robert Boyd's niece.

35:52.578 --> 35:54.375
Wait, wait...

35:54.980 --> 35:58.211
And before that!
Victim number two!

35:58.283 --> 36:00.444
She was the paramedic
on the golf course.

36:00.519 --> 36:02.282
Oh, there's got to be
a good explanation.

36:02.354 --> 36:05.882
I know Angeline,
and she's a good person.

36:05.959 --> 36:07.927
Whoa, whoa.
You know her?

36:07.994 --> 36:10.394
I mean, I've seen her
around. She's a customer.

36:10.463 --> 36:11.987
She's a customer?

36:12.065 --> 36:14.158
Has she ever bought
any of those dolls?

36:14.234 --> 36:16.361
Sure, five, maybe six.

36:17.370 --> 36:18.769
That's it.

36:18.838 --> 36:20.863
That's it.
She's the guy.

36:20.940 --> 36:21.929
Who's the guy?

36:22.008 --> 36:23.566
The paramedic!

36:23.644 --> 36:26.044
Angeline, she's
the connection.

36:26.113 --> 36:28.308
Her uncle was loaded.
He was the real target.

36:28.382 --> 36:32.512
The other dolls were just
distractions. It was so simple.

36:32.586 --> 36:33.951
It was brilliant!

36:34.021 --> 36:37.616
<i>All she needed were some
packages that had been postmarked.</i>

36:37.691 --> 36:40.660
<i>So she mailed a few
empty boxes to herself,</i>

36:41.061 --> 36:44.190
<i>then she waited. She
needed the right accident,</i>

36:44.266 --> 36:45.631
<i>the right victim.</i>

36:45.700 --> 36:49.136
<i>Martha Murphy was
perfect. She lived alone.</i>

36:49.404 --> 36:52.840
<i>Angeline stole her key,
snuck into her house,</i>

36:52.907 --> 36:56.900
<i>and left the box and
customized doll in plain sight.</i>

36:57.545 --> 37:01.003
<i>Two days later, she did the
same thing with Mr. Farris.</i>

37:01.449 --> 37:04.214
<i>The third victim
was the real target.</i>

37:04.920 --> 37:06.911
<i>Killing her uncle
was easy.</i>

37:06.989 --> 37:11.016
<i>Angeline's a paramedic. She
knew exactly what drugs to use,</i>

37:11.093 --> 37:15.325
<i>something untraceable, something
that would look like a heart attack.</i>

37:15.398 --> 37:17.832
<i>She put some good-luck
charms around his house</i>

37:17.900 --> 37:21.301
<i>to make him look superstitious,
and the stage was set.</i>

37:22.673 --> 37:26.905
Thanks a lot, Detective. I'll probably
never sell another voodoo doll.

37:43.261 --> 37:47.459
You're in a lot of pain.
Let me get you something.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.135
Do you have
a cell phone?

37:51.669 --> 37:53.227
No, I never use them.

37:53.304 --> 37:56.171
I prefer to communicate
over the astral plane.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.434
Hadley!

38:00.846 --> 38:01.938
Fine.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.222
Go! Go, go, go!
Just go, go, go!

38:38.351 --> 38:41.219
You're gonna have
to ram it. Come on!

38:41.889 --> 38:45.256
You have to ram it.
Do it! Just do it now!

38:59.808 --> 39:01.503
Oh!
Oh, God!

39:01.977 --> 39:03.239
Call an ambulance!

39:03.311 --> 39:05.245
A different ambulance,
this one's cursed.

39:05.313 --> 39:06.610
Right away.

39:14.423 --> 39:16.448
I don't
understand. Why me?

39:16.525 --> 39:19.086
She was afraid I was getting too close.

39:19.162 --> 39:20.993
She was trying to
keep me distracted.

39:21.063 --> 39:23.759
Aw, because she knew how
much you cared about me.

39:23.833 --> 39:26.996
She knew you'd be so worried about
me, you couldn't think straight.

39:27.069 --> 39:28.263
Well, that was
her theory, yes.

39:28.337 --> 39:30.305
But don't forget, she
was clinically insane.

39:30.373 --> 39:31.863
I'm so relieved.

39:31.941 --> 39:33.499
I've never been
happier to be wrong.

39:33.576 --> 39:34.600
About what?

39:34.677 --> 39:38.136
Oh, about everything. About
voodoo, about Mitch and me.

39:38.549 --> 39:43.213
Good! I'm glad. Welcome back to
the real world, the world of facts

39:43.287 --> 39:46.085
and science
and rational thought.

39:46.156 --> 39:47.953
Hmm. You missed one.

39:52.029 --> 39:53.189
You were saying?

39:53.263 --> 39:57.724
Facts and science. Natalie, if you
let superstition rule your life,

39:57.802 --> 40:00.532
you're just avoiding
any responsibility.

40:00.605 --> 40:02.095
You missed another one.
I did not.

40:02.173 --> 40:05.006
You missed it. I watched
you, you missed it.

40:16.154 --> 40:17.747
Where was I?
Rational thought.

40:17.823 --> 40:22.624
Exactly. Superstitions,
hexes, curses, voodoo,

40:23.095 --> 40:26.223
they're all just
crutches that people use

40:26.298 --> 40:28.323
when they can't
cope with the...
