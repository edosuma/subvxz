CHRIS ROCK:
Going to high school
is full of pressure

00:06.340 --> 00:08.242
because you barely spend
any time there

00:08.276 --> 00:10.611
before they start trying
to prepare you for college.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.414
These are guidebooks
for the PSATs.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.117
What's that?

00:16.150 --> 00:18.186
It's a preliminary
college exam.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.820
If you do well on
this, chances are

00:19.853 --> 00:22.056
you'll get into
a good college,
get a good job,

00:22.090 --> 00:23.291
and have a good life.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.326
What if you don't do good?

00:25.359 --> 00:26.494
If you don't do well...

00:26.527 --> 00:27.495
Then you get something

00:27.528 --> 00:29.497
from my box of paper hats.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.065
Let's see...

00:31.099 --> 00:33.501
which one of these will
look good on your head?

00:37.205 --> 00:41.209
Try that.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.643
See if you can
read that.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.545
"May I take your
order, please?"

00:44.578 --> 00:45.546
Perfect.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.780
If you suck
on the PSAT,

00:46.814 --> 00:48.249
you got nothing
to worry about.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.617
You got a future
ahead of you.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.452
A super-sized future.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.234
* Ah, make it funky now.

Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:24.285 --> 01:27.221
I wanted to do well
on the PSAT,

01:27.255 --> 01:29.423
but my mother wanted me
to do better...

01:29.457 --> 01:30.824
Look at this, Chris.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.760
You could get
a National Merit Scholarship.

01:32.793 --> 01:36.130
If you get enough answers right,
you get money, like on Jeopardy.

01:36.164 --> 01:36.964
DREW:
Actually, on Jeopardy,

01:36.997 --> 01:38.666
you have to get
the questions right.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.734
Actually, nobody asked you.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.370
JULIUS:
They give scholarships
for being smart?

01:42.403 --> 01:45.206
I thought they only gave
scholarships for playing sports.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.208
Do they give scholarships
for being an idiot?

01:47.241 --> 01:48.209
Chris can get that.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.843
ROCHELLE:
Hush, Tonya.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.545
Chris, if you do
well on this,

01:51.579 --> 01:53.214
this would really mean a lot.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.615
You know what,
I'm thinking about

01:54.648 --> 01:57.618
enrolling you, Drew, and Tonya
into Hansel and Gretel.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.187
What's Hansel and Gretel?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.289
Hansel and Gretel is
a social organization

02:01.322 --> 02:03.557
made up of successful
black families.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.593
You know, the upper crust
of the black community.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.860
We were just the crust.

02:06.894 --> 02:07.761
How are we supposed to get in?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.363
Well, we're successful
in our own way.

02:09.397 --> 02:10.564
I mean each of us

02:10.598 --> 02:12.600
has something
that we can be proud of.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.502
I'm not pregnant.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.237
I'm not on drugs.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.104
I'm not in a gang.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.572
I actually know
where all my kids are.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.674
See, baby, we're almost perfect.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.942
We're damn near white.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.313
You know what, we're going to go
to a meet-and-greet on Sunday.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.414
If they like us, we're in.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.416
While my mother was happy,

02:28.449 --> 02:31.319
the big test was
making Greg testy.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.320
This test is a monster.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.921
Have you looked
at this thing?

02:33.954 --> 02:36.357
It covers everything
from analogies and
reading comprehension

02:36.390 --> 02:39.227
to algebra, geometry,
statistics and probability.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.429
Anybody got a dictionary?
I don't have enough time
to do the work

02:41.462 --> 02:43.197
I need to do to stay
in this school.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.598
When am I going to find time
to do the work

02:44.632 --> 02:45.933
I need to do to get
into another school?

02:45.966 --> 02:46.900
Well, make time.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.236
You have to prepare
for this kind of exam.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.470
Study a few hours every night

02:49.503 --> 02:51.472
and then get eight hours of
sleep the night before the test.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.474
I haven't slept eight hours
since I was born.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.776
We were so broke,
we had to share our sleep.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.278
I don't know about you.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.312
I'm just going to cram it in
the night before.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.947
It'll be easier to remember
if I just read it.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.217
Historically, white people
prepare in advance,

03:03.251 --> 03:05.853
while black people deal
with things at the last minute.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.588
From going to the movies...

03:07.621 --> 03:10.458
So what's playing?
Anything good?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.528
Let me see...

03:14.562 --> 03:16.330
Spaceballs?

03:16.364 --> 03:18.399
What's that about?

03:18.432 --> 03:19.667
...to natural disasters.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.504
Yeah, girl. You know
anybody with a boat?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.449
Hey, little dude,
let me hold a dollar.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.354
That'll be a dollar.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.789
Here you go.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.691
PSATs, huh?

03:43.724 --> 03:46.727
You know, my uncle works at the
place that makes the test books.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.029
And I'm selling answer keys
if you need one.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.298
20 bucks.
No, I'm good.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.267
Well, you'll be better if you
have the answers to that test.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.537
I'd be better if you'd stop
robbing me every single day.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.673
Did you see this?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.409
"Congratulations.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.977
You have won
a free 27-inch color TV."

04:04.011 --> 04:05.479
What is this, a scam?

04:05.513 --> 04:06.814
No, it's legit. I called.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.383
They said I just have
to come down and pick it up.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.951
What, did you buy
a raffle ticket or something?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.686
Not that I can remember.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.422
But I enter
every contest I see.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.425
He once entered a contest
to win a free contest.

04:17.458 --> 04:21.695
At Hansel and Gretel
my mother laid down the law

04:21.729 --> 04:23.597
like the big bad wolf.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.767
I need you guys to be
on your best behavior.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.704
So please, be sure to say
"please" and "thank you."

04:30.738 --> 04:33.407
And for God's sake,
use your right fork.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.876
Now if you don't know
what somebody is talking about,

04:35.909 --> 04:40.414
just look at them, nod,
and say, "Oh, really?"

04:40.448 --> 04:42.416
And agree, okay?

04:42.450 --> 04:43.684
Okay.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.752
Now go mingle.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.687
That's white-speak for talking.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.823
I just started taking
violin lessons.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.425
My parents took me
to Lincoln Center

04:51.459 --> 04:53.827
to see Itzhak Perlman.
He's a genius.

04:53.861 --> 04:57.331
My family could nod
and say, "Oh, really?"
Oh, really?

04:57.365 --> 04:58.932
But good luck
getting them to agree.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.635
The violin's okay.
I like the bass.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.036
Have you ever heard
the bass line

05:03.070 --> 05:04.605
to
"Get the Funk Out of My Face"?

05:04.638 --> 05:05.673
Louis Thunder

05:05.706 --> 05:07.608
Now that's
a genius.

05:07.641 --> 05:11.044
When Americans talk about dance,
it's always Michael Jackson,

05:11.078 --> 05:14.482
but I think that if more people
were to see Baryshnikov,

05:14.515 --> 05:15.916
they would feel differently.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.585
Oh, really?

05:17.618 --> 05:20.454
Well, a lot of people saw him
dance in White Nights

05:20.488 --> 05:22.356
and they're still talking
about Michael Jackson.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.558
I'm more of a
Boogaloo Shrimp fan myself.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.627
So we all bought houses
on the Vineyard.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.961
Aw, let me tell you,

05:27.995 --> 05:31.365
weekends at the Inkwell
in the summer are amazing.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.833
Oh, really?

05:32.866 --> 05:35.936
So you bought another house...
in another state

05:35.969 --> 05:38.606
so you can get in the car
with your wife and kids

05:38.639 --> 05:39.740
and drive
eight hours

05:39.773 --> 05:41.909
so you can hang out
with the same people

05:41.942 --> 05:43.944
you hang out with
during the week?

05:43.977 --> 05:45.646
That is amazing.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.381
While my family
was putting people off,

05:47.415 --> 05:48.649
my mother was turning it on.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.917
Hello, everyone.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.819
This is my son Chris.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.787
He's taking his PSAT
on Monday.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.456
Well done.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.758
George Watkins.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.461
Very impressive, Chris.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.496
You're taking the first
step towards college

06:02.530 --> 06:03.664
and a very bright future.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.665
And this is...?

06:04.698 --> 06:05.966
God, not you.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.468
You two know each other?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.869
Yes.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.738
He's the so-called judge

06:10.771 --> 06:12.440
that threw me in jail

06:12.473 --> 06:14.442
after I beat
that speeding ticket.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.944
You were in contempt.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.446
She still is.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.581
Look, okay, that is
ancient history, all right?

06:20.614 --> 06:21.882
I'm past that.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.453
I'm here today
for my children.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.521
Well, if you son is
doing well in school,

06:27.555 --> 06:29.523
this is an opportunity for him
to meet the right people.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.891
He's doing very well, thank you.

06:30.924 --> 06:31.992
He's working on

06:32.025 --> 06:33.126
a Merit Scholarship.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.695
She might as well have said

06:34.728 --> 06:36.564
I was working
on a cure for cancer.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.799
Really

06:38.832 --> 06:41.769
That's right.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.672
Well, you're obviously trying
to better yourself.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.973
How about we let

06:46.006 --> 06:47.608
bygones be bygones?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.610
Bye... Gone.

06:49.643 --> 06:53.046
That's how proper black people
say, "Let's squash this."

06:53.080 --> 06:55.115
Chris, just make sure you study
a little every night

06:55.148 --> 06:56.950
and get eight hours of sleep
before your test.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.652
Don't cram.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.953
That's a surefire way to fail.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.655
Okay, great. Good to see you.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.090
:
Good to see you, too.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.859
I don't think he means it.
Hello.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.596
Back at home, if the judge
had been around

07:08.629 --> 07:09.963
he'd be holding me in contempt.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.565
Boy, what are you doing?

07:11.599 --> 07:12.800
Didn't you hear
what the judge said?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.067
You need to go to bed.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.669
But...
But nothing!

07:15.703 --> 07:18.539
Stop studying so you can
do well on that test!

07:18.572 --> 07:21.509
First time I ever heard that.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.115
Since I didn't get to cram
on my test,

07:28.148 --> 07:31.118
there was only one thing
left to do.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.352
Hey, Jerome...

07:32.385 --> 07:34.988
Little dude from
across the street.
Let me hold a dollar.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.958
I'll let you hold $20.
I need the answer key
to the PSAT test.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.693
Now you're thinking.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.031
All right, everyone, listen up.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.066
The test is about to commence.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.870
No pressure... it's just
the rest of your lives at stake.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.972
Begin.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.909
While everyone else
took the test,

07:55.943 --> 07:57.645
I took out the answers.

08:04.718 --> 08:09.189
And after the test results
were in, I got called out.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.925
Chris, I just never would have
expected this out of you.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.227
I just don't see
how you could do this.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.597
When you're about to go down
for a crime,

08:16.630 --> 08:17.898
everybody knows it's best

08:17.931 --> 08:19.867
to throw yourself
on the mercy of the court.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.802
Ms. Morello, I can explain.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.704
This test meant
a lot to my mother.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.972
I bet it did.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.007
And she must be proud of you.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.242
A perfect score
on the PSAT test?

08:29.276 --> 08:32.946
That's unheard of in
the history of this school.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.082
You're like a little
chocolate Einstein.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.316
More like chocolate Pinocchio.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.417
Thanks.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.120
Anyway, we're taking you out
of your regular classes

08:40.153 --> 08:42.723
and putting you in the
Advanced Placement program.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.825
Advanced Placement?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.660
Yes. If you think
white people are smart,

08:46.694 --> 08:48.629
wait until you to go class
with the Asians.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.834
Back home, I decided to keep
my high score on the down low.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.236
Chris, how did you do
on the PSAT?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.972
Oh, I think I did fine.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.708
Hallie Berry fine.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.676
They should be sending
the scores soon.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.245
Good. 'Cause I want to impress
those Hansel and Gretel people.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.181
And I want to brag about your
score to that Judge Watkins.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.719
Nothing like using your kids
to fight your battles for you.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.688
I stood out in AP class
because unlike everyone else,

09:14.722 --> 09:15.823
I was dumb.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.692
I need you to read
The Theory of Atomic Physics,

09:18.726 --> 09:22.195
Quantum Dynamics
and Worm Holes,

09:22.229 --> 09:24.965
and Richard Feynman's
Quantum Electrodynamics:

09:24.998 --> 09:28.035
The Strange Theory
of Light and Matter.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.604
Which were all made
into Wayans Brother movies.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.706
Then write a report
on each of them

09:32.740 --> 09:34.842
presenting an alternate theory
to each central thesis.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.276
This is a tough assignment

09:36.309 --> 09:38.078
so I'll give you plenty of time.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.279
You have until tomorrow.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.281
While I dealt with my success,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.016
Greg dealt with his failure.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.785
Advanced Placement classes.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.854
I can't understand how you
did so well on the test.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.689
I studied for days
and still did horribly.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.224
Greg... I cheated.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.960
I had the answers.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.895
Dude, why didn't you tell me?
I could have used them, too.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.129
Don't you think
it'd look suspicious

09:56.163 --> 09:58.065
if you and I ended up
with identical scores?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.767
Plus, he would have panicked
and ratted me out.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.870
Yeah, plus, I would have
panicked and ratted you out.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.839
At least now I have a year
to study for the real SATs,

10:05.873 --> 10:07.107
which I'm going to take
legitimately.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.742
So technically,
this really wasn't cheating.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.910
With that kind of thinking,

10:09.943 --> 10:11.779
I should have gone
into politics.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.347
Dude, you're in the AP class.
What about that?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.383
No problem.
I won't last in there a week.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.250
How do you know?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.819
Oh, I know.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.187
While I wanted to be free

10:20.220 --> 10:23.691
from AP class,
my father wanted a free TV.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.858
Hi. How you doing?
Hey.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.327
I'm here to pick up
a TV set I won.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.662
Oh, okay, I just need
to see some ID

10:28.696 --> 10:29.963
to make sure your name's
on the list.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.932
Okay.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.400
Those TVs are nice.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.102
Yeah.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.804
Oh, we got you.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.939
Okay, Julius, just
sign right here.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.308
Okay, great,
that's everything.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.776
All right.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.211
You're under arrest!

10:46.013 --> 10:48.015
What? What am I
under arrest for?

10:48.048 --> 10:50.751
30 unpaid parking tickets
from 1982!

10:50.784 --> 10:52.285
Parking tickets?!

10:52.319 --> 10:53.754
Yeah, maybe next time
you'll think twice

10:53.787 --> 10:55.188
before you try and cheat
New York City

10:55.222 --> 10:56.323
out of a quarter!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.858
Does this mean
I don't get the free TV?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.126
Get him the hell
out of here!

10:59.159 --> 11:00.928
Ow! Ow!

11:00.961 --> 11:02.429
While my father
was thrown in jail,

11:02.462 --> 11:05.398
I tried to get
thrown out of class.

11:05.432 --> 11:10.403
Does anyone...
have... the answer?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.272
Does your mama
have the answer?

11:12.305 --> 11:13.974
Excuse me?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.343
Don't excuse me.
Excuse your mama.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.313
"Excuse your mama?"

11:20.347 --> 11:22.149
Chris, what were
you thinking?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.450
I don't know.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.985
I guess I have to go back
to Thurman's class now.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.120
No, I can get you
back into AP class,

11:27.154 --> 11:29.122
but no more "your mama" jokes.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.391
Obviously, you need a challenge.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.727
So, I'm putting you on the
Academic Scholastathon Team.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.263
The Academic Scholasta

11:36.296 --> 11:37.530
Scholastathon!

11:37.564 --> 11:40.768
It's a team competition where
students match their intellects

11:40.801 --> 11:42.235
against students
from other schools.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.471
I'm not sure
I'm right for this.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.873
Are you kidding?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.841
This will be like
intellectual basketball.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.409
And you're our Dr. J!

11:49.442 --> 11:52.445
I just hope I don't get hung
from the intellectual rim.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.485
While I faced humiliation

11:58.518 --> 12:00.153
with the Academic
Scholastathon Team,

12:00.187 --> 12:01.889
my father faced
something worse:

12:01.922 --> 12:02.522
my mother.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.858
Parking tickets, Julius?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.894
I'm trying to get us
into Hansel and Gretel

12:06.927 --> 12:08.528
and now I got to
get you out of jail?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.864
I paid those tickets
with one money order.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.266
Look, I even have
the receipt right here.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.367
We can straighten this out
when we get to court.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.771
I don't understand why they
didn't get my money order.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.909
I'm damned if I ain't getting
time off for my wedding!

12:21.942 --> 12:23.911
You want me to file
the money orders?!

12:23.944 --> 12:26.780
I'll file the money orders...
Julius!

12:33.353 --> 12:36.389
Back at school, even though I
seemed to keep failing upwards,

12:36.423 --> 12:39.026
I was about to take
my whole team down.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.796
Welcome to today's
Academic Scholastathon match

12:42.830 --> 12:48.235
between Tattaglia High
and John Saxon High.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.369
Today's questions will focus

12:49.402 --> 12:54.141
on the subject
of Afro-American icons.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.209
Our first question goes

12:56.243 --> 12:58.445
to last week's champion.

12:58.478 --> 13:03.483
"What famous Afro-American
basketball player

13:03.516 --> 13:08.555
claims to have slept
with over 20,000 women?"

13:08.588 --> 13:10.824
Sheryl Swoops?

13:10.858 --> 13:12.459
We don't know.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.895
Tattaglia?

13:14.928 --> 13:17.097
Wilt Chamberlain.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.867
Correct!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.434
The teams were all white,

13:21.468 --> 13:23.837
but unfortunately for them,
the questions were all black.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.105
Shirley Chisholm.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.940
Correct!

13:26.974 --> 13:28.208
Earl the Pearl Monroe.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.142
Correct.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.143
Jimi Hendrix.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.278
Correct!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.612
Peaches and Herbs.
Huggy Bear.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.847
Bugaloo Shrimp!

13:33.881 --> 13:36.216
:
Correct!

13:37.650 --> 13:41.021
With a perfect score
of 34 to nothing,

13:41.054 --> 13:44.057
the match goes
to Tattaglia High!

13:46.359 --> 13:48.862
My Academic Scholastathon
performance was pure luck.

13:48.896 --> 13:52.232
Unfortunately, my mother
thought it was pure genius.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.266
Chris, how come you
didn't tell me

13:53.300 --> 13:55.936
your were on the Athletic
Scholastathon Team?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.637
'Cause I didn't want
to jinx my match.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.007
Well, you may not want
to brag, but I do.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.943
Now, I got to tell everybody
to come to your next match.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.646
She told my family,
our friends, our neighbors...

14:06.679 --> 14:07.714
Kill Moves?!
Judge Watkins!

14:07.747 --> 14:11.151
Yes, Judge Watkins,
you have to come see him...

14:11.184 --> 14:12.485
Pretty much
everybody on Earth.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.055
and even a few people
not on Earth.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.290
Mission control,
there is a black woman

14:17.324 --> 14:18.391
outside of the Space Station.

14:18.425 --> 14:23.330
Hey! Come see my son
in the Academic Scholastathon!

14:23.363 --> 14:24.664
He's really smart.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.499
He gets it from me!

14:26.533 --> 14:28.635
Everybody there
wanted to see me

14:28.668 --> 14:31.972
in the Academic Scholastathon
except me.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.907
The questions today will be

14:33.941 --> 14:37.444
on the conjugation
of Lithuanian verbs.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.578
Oh, yes!

14:38.611 --> 14:43.416
First question to the champions
of last week, Tattaglia.

14:45.118 --> 14:49.156
What is the pluperfect
of the verb dirbit?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.024
I don't know.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.060
Who doesn't know dirba?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.061
Hiroshima High?

14:54.094 --> 14:55.095
Dirba.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.130
Correct.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.599
Let's try
another question.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.035
After that, I came down
quicker than Milli Vanilli

15:02.069 --> 15:03.536
after the lip sync scandal.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.537
MODERATOR:
Tattaglia?

15:04.571 --> 15:05.538
I don't know.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.639
Hiroshima?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.075
Matea.

15:08.108 --> 15:08.708
Tattaglia?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.143
I don't know.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.011
Suprasti.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.279
I got nothing.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.246
Pirkti.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.982
CHRIS:
I don't know.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.416
HIROSHIMA GIRL:
Atsibosti.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.985
Wilt Chamberlain?

15:18.018 --> 15:18.618
Zvimbti.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.153
Correct!

15:20.187 --> 15:23.023
And that is the final question.

15:23.056 --> 15:28.328
And the winner with a perfect
score of 34 to nothing:

15:28.361 --> 15:30.363
Hiroshima High!

15:37.504 --> 15:39.606
I hope this doesn't
hurt our chances

15:39.639 --> 15:41.374
for getting
into Hansel and Gretel.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.410
Oh, your chances aren't hurt.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.744
Oh, thank God.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.179
They're destroyed.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.516
Decimated, obliterated,
annihilated.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.419
Okay, okay! I get it.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.454
Rochelle, your kid's an idiot.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.758
You nearly had me at the mixer.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.328
I knew Chris was an idiot.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.431
After decapitating
the Academic Scholastathon,

16:04.464 --> 16:07.467
I was never so happy to be sad.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.403
You okay, baby?

16:10.437 --> 16:14.241
Mom, I know how much you wanted
us to be in Hansel and Gretel.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.009
So, I'm sorry I messed up.

16:16.043 --> 16:19.012
Baby, if they think this
family's not good enough

16:19.046 --> 16:22.015
to join their stupid club,
then forget them.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.017
Bet they'd beg me to join now!

16:24.051 --> 16:25.785
I'm proud of you.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.087
Even though I lied and cheated?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.155
Thanks, Mom.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.457
Having my mother believe
in me when I was wrong

16:30.490 --> 16:33.393
was one of the reasons that
I always wanted to do right.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.196
Hey, did you ever get
those PSAT scores back?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.698
Oh, um, I'll get them
to you tomorrow.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.236
While I was planning
to settle my score,

16:43.270 --> 16:45.705
my mother and father
had to settle a case.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.709
Case 765443.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.244
That's me.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.213
All right, I see
you have a complaint

16:53.246 --> 16:55.748
regarding a series
of unpaid parking tickets.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.051
Oh, no, not you.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.652
What-What are you,
following me around?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.521
You think I want
to be here?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.690
Say the wrong thing
and you'll get locked up

17:03.723 --> 17:05.725
faster than a door with
Jehovah's Witnesses coming.

17:05.758 --> 17:10.130
Just joking, witnesses.
We love you guys!

17:10.163 --> 17:12.265
Uh, Your Honor, I have
a receipt that shows

17:12.299 --> 17:13.433
I paid all the tickets
in question.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.168
You may approach the bench.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.369
Objection!
Rochelle!

17:16.403 --> 17:18.571
What are you objecting to?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.840
The way you treated
my family.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.409
Listen, I am trying
to give you a break.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.311
I suggest you fix your attitude.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.412
You're the one
with the attitude.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.614
Let me tell you
something.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.316
Just because you do
summer in the Vineyard,

17:29.349 --> 17:31.284
and you go swimming
in the Inkpen,

17:31.318 --> 17:34.354
and you play the violin
instead of the funky bass,

17:34.387 --> 17:36.856
and you eat those, all those
stupid little finger foods,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.826
does not make you better
than somebody. Okay?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.861
My son is a good kid!

17:41.894 --> 17:43.630
And my husband

17:43.663 --> 17:44.697
is innocent!

17:44.731 --> 17:46.233
So, you know what?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.268
You can take your little
Hansel and Gretel

17:48.301 --> 17:50.503
and you can
shove it up your...

17:50.537 --> 17:52.272
Lady, you are out of order!

17:52.305 --> 17:53.140
No! You're out of order!

17:53.173 --> 17:56.276
You're out of order!

17:56.309 --> 17:57.477
This whole trial
is out of order!

17:57.510 --> 17:58.878
Get her out of here.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.414
Get her out of here!

18:02.582 --> 18:04.317
Attica!

18:04.351 --> 18:05.652
I have the receipts.
Attica!

18:07.154 --> 18:09.756
Get him, Julius!

18:09.789 --> 18:11.124
Back home it appeared
that both jail

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
and the PSATs
were behind us.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.562
She screamed at
the judge? Cool!

18:15.595 --> 18:16.563
What happened after that?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.798
The money I was going to
save by winning the case

18:18.831 --> 18:20.233
I had to spend to bail
your mother out of jail.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.136
Judge Watkins?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.737
Oh, look what
we have here.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.207
I cannot believe you even
showed your face here.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.408
We ain't in court now.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.910
And we don't
want to go back.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.779
I just came to say I'm sorry.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.214
What?

18:34.247 --> 18:35.648
The goal at Hansel and Gretel

18:35.682 --> 18:37.750
is to create a better life
for our children.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.419
You and your husband

18:39.452 --> 18:41.254
obviously care
about your kids.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.622
And if you're interested,

18:42.655 --> 18:44.624
I'd like to officially
invite you to join.

18:44.657 --> 18:45.425
Chris?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.693
Ms. Morello?

18:46.726 --> 18:50.363
So, what, are you trying to skip
town before the heat comes down?

18:50.397 --> 18:51.631
What are you talking about?

18:51.664 --> 18:56.936
Let's just say this young man is
cracked, busted, and found out.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.338
WATKINS:
Found out
about what?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.273
There was a citywide
security breach.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.609
Chris was one
of 1,400 students

19:02.642 --> 19:04.811
to get a perfect score
on his PSATs.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.280
Hold up, are you trying
to say that my son cheated?

19:07.314 --> 19:08.815
I didn't say that.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.882
But you were thinking it.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.851
You know, it's really not polite

19:11.884 --> 19:14.153
to use your voodoo mind tricks
on white people.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.657
So, your son cheated
on his test?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.326
And the only reason
he got a perfect score

19:19.359 --> 19:21.461
in the Academic
Scholastathon

19:21.494 --> 19:24.197
is because the questions
were all about black people.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.266
There's a competition with
questions about black people?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.901
I'm sorry, but Chris,

19:28.935 --> 19:32.405
you're back in your regular
classes as of next week, and...

19:32.439 --> 19:34.907
Yeah, I know. Detention.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.075
No, that would be too easy.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.712
I'm making you stay on the
Academic Scholastathon Team.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.348
As your punishment,

19:41.381 --> 19:42.782
you can go on losing
along with them.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.753
Well, I have to go
while I still have some hubcaps.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.754
Too late!

19:47.787 --> 19:50.390
And I don't know
who you are,

19:50.423 --> 19:52.592
but I love a black man
in a suit.

19:52.625 --> 19:56.429
Call me.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.468
I know, obliterated,
decapitated, incarcerated.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.735
Bye!

20:02.769 --> 20:04.771
He's going to go
get adulterated!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.846
Boy, I ought to knock you
into subspace.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.015
Isn't that kind of ridiculous?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.850
Mission Control,

20:17.884 --> 20:19.852
that stupid black kid is
outside of the Space Station.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.854
Help me!

20:21.888 --> 20:25.892
