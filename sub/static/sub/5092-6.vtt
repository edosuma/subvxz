WEBVTT

00:05.573 --> 00:08.409
DANNY:
Look at this-- gun collar,
two weapons possessions,

00:08.442 --> 00:10.244
two outstanding warrants.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.712
You know, we gotta take

00:11.745 --> 00:13.581
these transit assignments
more often, Jack.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.848
Yeah, well, maybe
they'll think twice

00:14.882 --> 00:18.119
before they jump the turnstile
with a pistol in their pocket.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.353
That's right, Einstein.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.422
Try to save yourself
two bucks,

00:21.455 --> 00:23.757
you get two
years instead.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.627
(indistinct radio
communication)

00:29.197 --> 00:31.232
REPORTERS: The NYPD crackdown
on subway fare-beaters

00:31.265 --> 00:33.234
has once again yielded
numerous arrests

00:33.267 --> 00:34.668
on more serious charges.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.770
But not everyone
is singing the praises

00:36.804 --> 00:39.073
of Commissioner Reagan's
popular program.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.242
I'm here with the
Reverend Darnell Potter

00:41.275 --> 00:43.244
of the Disciples
of Isaiah Church.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.678
Reverend, this program

00:44.712 --> 00:46.614
has gotten dozens of
guns off the street.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.449
Isn't that hard
to argue with?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.818
Not if the ends don't
justify the means, Jane.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.354
I mean, this program
is oppressive.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.688
It is offensive.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.690
Yet another example
of Commissioner Reagan's

00:56.724 --> 00:59.393
extreme tactics, and one
that I don't see him practicing

00:59.427 --> 01:00.728
in the white neighborhoods.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.563
REPORTER:
What exactly are you saying?

01:02.596 --> 01:03.764
I'd give my right arm

01:03.797 --> 01:06.600
to stick my left foot
in your mouth, pal.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.270
I'm afraid that would be
considered excessive force, Pop.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.605
Fine, then I'll use
a sock instead.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.641
What's he saying
about me this morning?

01:13.674 --> 01:16.377
That you're an oppressor
and a racist.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.545
That's all?

01:17.578 --> 01:18.712
He's dogging it.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.282
It's not funny, Francis.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.683
The buck
has got to stop somewhere,

01:22.716 --> 01:25.153
and this time,
it's on Frank Reagan's desk.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.720
This guy's dangerous.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.721
Only if you're
standing between him

01:27.755 --> 01:28.856
and a television camera.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.824
POTTER:
Do you think we're gonna see

01:30.858 --> 01:33.794
this kind of chain-gang
parade in SoHo?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.496
Hm? No.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.100
(siren blares)

01:47.608 --> 01:50.578
I swear, Reagan,
sometimes I'm convinced

01:50.611 --> 01:52.246
that God Himself
is a member

01:52.280 --> 01:53.714
of the Fraternal
Order of Police.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.783
Yeah? Why's that?
'Cause every
once in a while

01:55.816 --> 01:57.518
he lets a clown like this

01:57.551 --> 01:59.453
blow a red light when
I'm right behind him.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.789
It's your lucky,
day, Sarge.
Yeah, I guess so.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.391
License and
registration.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.559
I don't care, I want it
on my desk in ten minutes!

02:05.593 --> 02:08.829
DRIVER:
If you don't have Stadler's
numbers on it, I don't care.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.531
I don't care, either.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.632
Take your time.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.833
He's gonna be a
while, all right?

02:12.866 --> 02:15.269
License and registration.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.575
MAN (over radio):
12 George. 10-30.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.577
Male with a gun at 122 Lenox.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.747
12 Sergeant op. Copy that.
Show us responding, okay?

02:26.780 --> 02:31.852
What do you know-- it turns out
it's your lucky day, GQ.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.790
(siren wailing)

02:49.337 --> 02:51.739
We got a call about
a robbery in progress.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.608
All police inquiries go through
Reverend Potter's office.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.344
Show us your hands, please.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.882
That's a sanctuary up there.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.218
Yeah? Not for a man with a gun.
Now, step aside.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.220
There's no firearms
permitted inside.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.888
That's exactly the way we feel.
Step aside. Now.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.623
Back up, I said.
Back up.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.461
We have two officers
approaching now.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.662
Over here.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.400
All right, that's
far enough.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.234
Right there.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.302
You were told

03:21.335 --> 03:22.770
this is a house
of worship.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.572
Step aside right now.
Man, you're not getting in.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.906
We're not screwing
around anymore.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.576
Now, make a hole.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.743
Get your hands off him!

03:29.777 --> 03:30.778
(grunting)

03:36.650 --> 03:39.953
(both groaning)

03:39.987 --> 03:41.722
Sarge...

03:41.755 --> 03:43.291
Sarge, you okay?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.758
Huh?
You all right?

03:44.792 --> 03:45.993
Sarge...

03:49.363 --> 03:51.932
Hey, back up!
Back up!

03:51.965 --> 03:53.467
Stay back!

03:53.501 --> 03:55.969
10-85, forthwith!

03:56.003 --> 03:57.671
Uh, 122 Lenox.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.373
I need a bus.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.575
(siren wailing)

04:04.011 --> 04:05.513
(tires squeal)

04:10.618 --> 04:13.020
(sirens wailing)

04:16.690 --> 04:17.991
What's going on?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.660
Officers in distress,
a few blocks away.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.662
All right, take them.
Jack, we gotta go.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.696
Take them.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.599
Watch out!
Excuse me.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.669
(indistinct shouts)

04:31.972 --> 04:32.973
Move aside!
Step back!

04:33.006 --> 04:35.676
(clamoring)
Let go!

04:35.709 --> 04:36.977
I got you, Sarge.
This way.

04:38.812 --> 04:39.913
What the hell's going on?

04:39.947 --> 04:40.714
Back up! Hey, kid!

04:40.748 --> 04:42.816
Danny...
DANNY:
What happened?

04:42.850 --> 04:44.552
He's hurt.
A bus is on the way.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.019
Whoa! Hey! Back off!
Hey! I said back up!

04:46.053 --> 04:48.322
MAN:
This is a church!
Hey!

04:48.356 --> 04:50.958
Come here... come here...
What are you doing, huh?

04:50.991 --> 04:53.561
Put your hands on
a police officer, huh?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.963
MAN:
Better watch your back, pig!

04:55.996 --> 04:56.997
Hey! Back it up!

04:57.030 --> 04:59.032
10-13. We need more units.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.034
We got a situation here.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.936
DANNY:
I said back up!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.402
How's he doing?

05:34.435 --> 05:35.569
Hey.
He'll live.

05:35.603 --> 05:38.105
Yeah, he caught a lot worse
than that in fifth grade,

05:38.138 --> 05:40.107
banging around for the
basketball under the basket.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.174
Intentional foul.
Eh, it was

05:41.208 --> 05:43.811
fair and square, kid;
I'm just going for the ball.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.912
How's the sergeant?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.647
They don't know yet.
How are you?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.516
JAMIE: I'm fine.
It's not as bad

05:48.549 --> 05:50.951
as it looks.
The guy that pushed
you down the stairs--

05:50.984 --> 05:52.119
you see him over there?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.926
No. No, they must still

05:58.959 --> 06:00.728
be in the building.
Hey, J.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.962
You get a good look at him?

06:01.995 --> 06:03.130
Yeah, it was
a big guy,

06:03.163 --> 06:05.433
uh, with an earring,
and a skinny guy.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.701
Caught him with a backhand
when I was going down.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.170
Well, the guy you collared in
the car may know who they are.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.473
We better get them
out of here, though,

06:12.506 --> 06:14.508
before they launch a rescue.
Yeah,
all right.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.544
You all right?
Yeah.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.415
Are you sure you're all right?

06:21.449 --> 06:22.650
Yeah. I just feel stupid

06:22.683 --> 06:24.952
walking into something
like that, you know?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.187
There was supposed to be
a robbery, but I don't know.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.558
Whoa, hey, somebody says there's
a guy with a gun, you go in.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.060
Yeah, I know.
Kid, I know
I bust your chops

06:33.093 --> 06:34.728
about Harvard
and all that stuff,

06:34.762 --> 06:37.631
but listen to me-- what
you did today was true blue.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.433
I understand.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.801
I'll see you later.
All right.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.704
(sighs)

06:43.737 --> 06:46.474
Sergeant Renzulli
sustained a concussion,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.676
Officer Reagan just some
minor cuts and bruises,

06:48.709 --> 06:49.877
so far as we know.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.513
Is the scene secure?
In process.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.482
It's a commercial building, but
Reverend Potter's church rents

06:54.515 --> 06:55.816
an old theatre on
the second floor

06:55.849 --> 06:57.718
for their sanctuary.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.153
REPORTER: ...police officers
and members of the church.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.090
Now, details are sketchy,
but apparently

07:03.123 --> 07:05.058
the fight broke out
when the police officers

07:05.092 --> 07:06.527
were denied entry
in the building...

07:06.560 --> 07:08.195
It's on the sensitive
locations list.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.463
Communications should
have relayed that

07:09.497 --> 07:10.698
to the responding officers.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.033
And look, I know the guy
that runs this place

07:13.066 --> 07:14.201
is a thorn in your side...

07:14.234 --> 07:17.204
You give him too much credit--
He's just a camera hog.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.438
But the church does
a lot of good.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.841
Yeah, they tossed some drug
dealers out of the neighborhood.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.576
Well, now they've tossed
two police officers

07:22.610 --> 07:23.811
down a flight of stairs.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.746
Please don't tell me
we're heading out there.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.147
What, and make his day?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.550
Not if I can help it.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.984
REPORTER: The police don't
know what to do,

07:31.018 --> 07:32.786
because the church members
will not budge.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.690
Thank you.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.826
Erin?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.861
Well, if it isn't
Larry Skolnick.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.630
You missed me.
I'm touched.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.633
So, how's private practice
treating you?
Good.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.102
Heard you had a big tax evasion
case-- lot of press.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.671
Ka-ching, ka-ching.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.540
It paid for the new condo.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.574
45th floor, river view.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.975
You should come check it out.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.844
Yeah... ugh, heights
make me dizzy.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.245
Oh, even better.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.248
There's a great little Italian
place on the ground floor.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.783
You'd love it.
Thank you, Larry, but...

08:02.816 --> 08:04.618
We could talk about
opportunities for you.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.521
People in my firm
would jump to have you.

08:07.555 --> 08:10.023
Yeah, I don't think
I'm quite ready

08:10.057 --> 08:12.225
to cross over to the dark side.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.728
What, you really enjoy
butting heads

08:14.762 --> 08:16.263
with scuzzball drug dealers?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.599
You think I'm going to enjoy
defending them?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.834
(laughing)
Which reminds me--

08:20.868 --> 08:25.573
my 11:00 a.m. scuzzball
should be here any moment.
Actually...

08:25.606 --> 08:26.640
He's early.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.644
Larry Skolnick, counsel
for the scuzzball.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.897
MAN:
Commissioner, sir...
As you were.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.999
I'm sorry, Commissioner,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.266
but the situation's gone
from bad to worse.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.401
Don't apologize, Ed.

08:54.434 --> 08:58.071
I know that was the last
phone call you wanted to make.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.673
Ed?

08:59.707 --> 09:01.609
It's a standoff.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.677
They're over there,
we're over here.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.646
No communication
whatsoever.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.781
And the peanut gallery's
getting larger by the minute.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.618
All the exits secured?
Ten minutes ago.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.952
E.S.U.?
Captain?

09:11.985 --> 09:14.988
FRANK:
James?
Sir.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.691
We can take the
building any time.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.727
Simultaneous tactical
entry at five points.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.129
We can have this over
before lunch.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.931
This crowd's going
to love that.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.103
There's Potter.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.975
(crowd cheering)

09:36.677 --> 09:39.212
(applause)

09:47.688 --> 09:49.623
(reporters calling to Potter)

09:49.657 --> 09:51.992
(cheering)

09:52.025 --> 09:53.661
You should talk to him.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.163
I'm right here.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.398
Lucinda, I'm glad

09:58.431 --> 10:02.736
you and your colleagues are here
to witness this.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.905
A church that has rid
the community of drugs--

10:04.938 --> 10:08.375
has run job training programs
to help the people.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.342
And what do we get?

10:09.376 --> 10:12.780
A sea of blue surrounding
a house of worship.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.649
But there are
unconfirmed reports,

10:15.683 --> 10:17.751
Reverend, that church
security guards

10:17.785 --> 10:20.420
assaulted two police officers
answering a 911 call.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.657
You don't think a police
response was warranted?

10:23.691 --> 10:25.025
I have a question for you:

10:25.058 --> 10:26.660
Do you think we'd get
this same response

10:26.694 --> 10:28.896
if these unconfirmed
reports happened

10:28.929 --> 10:32.165
in St. Patrick's Cathedral?
Hell, no!

10:32.199 --> 10:33.701
Hell no is right!

10:33.734 --> 10:37.137
And there'll be
no negotiation

10:37.170 --> 10:40.207
until the police remove
their army of occupation.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.676
Captain, get your men ready.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.278
Can I get an
amen on that?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.280
CROWD:
Amen!

10:47.314 --> 10:49.449
We ain't going
anywhere here.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.184
We'll stay
right here.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.652
Right here!

10:58.225 --> 11:00.360
(knocks gently on door)

11:00.393 --> 11:01.995
How you feeling, Sarge?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.396
(sighs)

11:03.430 --> 11:06.199
Like I fell down a flight
of stairs on my noggin.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.902
That's funny 'cause that's
exactly what you did.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.738
(chuckles)

11:10.771 --> 11:12.873
Well, what do you know?

11:12.906 --> 11:14.241
Doc says you got
a concussion.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.176
You got to rest up
a couple more days.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.079
Yeah.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.349
Hey, do me a favor.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.851
Would you check
the drawer?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.886
Make sure my watch
is still there.

11:27.087 --> 11:30.791
My old man gave it to me
when I went on the job.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.025
Said after the gun,

11:32.059 --> 11:35.062
a cop's best friend is
knowing what time it is.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.030
Smart guy, your old man.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.332
Yeah, he was.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.472
He would have liked you, Reagan.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.741
He would have thought you was
a good influence on me.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.779
Close call out there
today, Sarge.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.413
Could have went
either way,

11:53.446 --> 11:55.415
but it went ours.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.884
Never look back, though, right?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.251
That's what you taught me?

11:58.285 --> 12:00.788
That's right, kid.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.856
And I wish I would have met
your old man

12:02.890 --> 12:04.792
so I could have set him straight
about one thing.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.496
It's you
who's a good influence on me.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.933
And you don't forget it.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.869
All right.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.877
The guy with the earring--
what was his name?

12:23.911 --> 12:25.378
Thurgood Marshall.
JACKIE:
And the skinny guy

12:25.412 --> 12:27.314
was, uh,
Clarence Thomas?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.782
You mock us?
DANNY:
Hey, you started

12:28.816 --> 12:29.883
with the jokes, friend.
Not to mention

12:29.917 --> 12:31.351
assaulting
a police officer.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.553
Someone pushed me from behind.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.188
Uh-huh.
I tripped into you.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.057
Right.
This whole thing was
a police provocation.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.159
Oh, right,
so those two officers--

12:39.192 --> 12:40.794
they just pushed themselves
down the stairs.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.594
Is that right?

12:41.628 --> 12:43.430
They burst
into a place of worship.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.032
With weapons.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.133
For no reason.
Except there was

12:46.166 --> 12:48.368
a report
of an armed robbery.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.037
What robbery?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.438
We were praying.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.339
It's a church.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.141
Right, it's a church
and you were praying.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.810
Then why did two officers
just burst in for no reason?

12:56.844 --> 12:59.046
There are elements
in the police, huh?

12:59.079 --> 13:00.047
Racists, provocateurs.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.849
Let's get one thing straight.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.051
Those cops weren't racists
and they weren't provocateurs.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.185
So they were
manipulated

13:05.218 --> 13:08.021
and lied to.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.161
There was no armed robbery.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.202
(sighs)

13:22.235 --> 13:23.036
Guy sees the world

13:23.070 --> 13:25.172
through a very special set
of blinders.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.006
Yeah, I'm
beginning to think

13:26.039 --> 13:27.574
there was no armed
robbery at all.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.843
Yeah, but somebody called up
and said there was one.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.144
Mm-hmm.
So let's pull
the 911 tape,

13:31.178 --> 13:33.046
see if we can't figure out
who it was.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.082
(typing)

13:36.416 --> 13:38.952
POTTER:
We shall not be moved!

13:38.986 --> 13:40.888
No!
We must witness!

13:40.921 --> 13:41.922
(cheering)

13:44.224 --> 13:46.193
Stand tall, stand tall!

13:46.226 --> 13:48.061
We're gonna stand
right here, y'all.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.496
With minimum force,
Captain.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.031
Understood.
Once you're inside,

13:51.064 --> 13:53.433
take special care
with any religious objects.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.103
Wasn't a Bible that threw
two men down the stairs.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.439
Yes, sir.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.308
(clamoring)

14:01.341 --> 14:02.842
Frank.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.313
The mayor's here.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.415
POTTER:
See,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.183
that's what I'm talking about.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.519
(cheering)

14:12.552 --> 14:14.487
POOLE:
How are you doing?
Yes,

14:14.521 --> 14:16.523
I'm doing good, sir,
I'm doing good.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.192
What the hell
is he doing?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.660
Campaigning.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.362
Come on back now, huh?
We'll see you.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.964
(cheering)

14:23.997 --> 14:25.132
That's what
I'm talking about.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.134
That is what I'm
talking about.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.135
Praise God.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.136
Frank.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.370
Mr. Mayor.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.072
How are we going
to defuse this?

14:32.105 --> 14:35.342
In about 90 seconds, we are
going to enter that building

14:35.375 --> 14:37.978
and arrest the men
who assaulted my officers.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.679
Don't you think negotiating
would be a better idea?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.581
Reverend Potter doesn't seem
to want to talk.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.416
We can't negotiate
with ourselves.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.318
Let me speak
with Reverend Potter.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.120
You just did.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.156
Frank, look around.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.159
Going in would be a mistake.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.163
Sir, sending a message
to the crowd

14:56.196 --> 14:57.630
that assaulting
a police officer

14:57.664 --> 15:01.634
doesn't have consequences--
that would be a mistake.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.138
Captain, you're a go.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.140
Go now.

15:07.174 --> 15:10.177
(crowd clamoring)

15:12.445 --> 15:13.646
No, no, no!

15:16.316 --> 15:17.217
That's not gonna happen.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.588
POTTER:
No, no!

15:21.621 --> 15:23.190
You see what's happening?
You see this?

15:23.223 --> 15:24.724
This is not justice!

15:24.757 --> 15:26.426
This is not justice!
Give me your hands!

15:27.727 --> 15:29.296
OFFICER: Yes, you!
Let's go, go, go!

15:29.329 --> 15:32.165
(protestors clamoring)

15:32.199 --> 15:34.134
You see what they doing
to my church!

15:34.167 --> 15:37.104
Not on my watch!
Not on my watch!

15:37.137 --> 15:38.471
Oh, hell, no!

15:38.505 --> 15:40.107
This is not justice!

15:40.140 --> 15:42.209
No! You need to
witness up here!

15:42.242 --> 15:44.311
This is not justice!
This is a church!

15:47.614 --> 15:49.516
(protestors clamoring)

16:03.463 --> 16:05.032
Sorry, Captain.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.066
Are you sure?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.201
I can keep them around
while you think it over.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.170
The guys who shoved us,
they're not here.

16:10.203 --> 16:10.870
They must've skipped
out the back

16:10.903 --> 16:12.172
before we secured the building.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.009
Okay.
Cut 'em loose.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.513
(clamoring)

16:25.052 --> 16:27.554
MAN: There's a man with a gun--
he's robbing people

16:27.587 --> 16:29.122
at 122 Lenox.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.390
I just ran out of there.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.691
He's a bad-ass.

16:31.724 --> 16:32.792
Got a gun.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.294
Be careful.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.029
Doesn't mention
it's a church?

16:36.063 --> 16:37.797
That's a funny thing.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.931
Even funnier thing is

16:38.965 --> 16:41.034
the call came from a pay phone
in Washington Heights.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.802
That's nowhere near
122 Lenox.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.337
No. So what does he do?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.805
He runs out of
a church in Harlem,

16:45.838 --> 16:47.374
doesn't stop till he gets
to Washington Heights?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.575
What's wrong?
There's no pay phones

16:48.608 --> 16:50.243
between Harlem
and Washington Heights?

16:50.277 --> 16:51.278
No, it's a bogus call.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.779
It's gotta be
a bogus call.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.581
But who would want
to trick the cops

16:54.614 --> 16:56.716
into running into
a prayer service?

16:56.749 --> 16:59.419
I don't know.
Let's go find out.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.325
I'm sure we can work something
out for Mr. Harten here.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.427
Sure.
Since he was found

17:07.460 --> 17:09.762
in possession of
four kilos of heroin

17:09.796 --> 17:12.499
and enough cocaine
to levitate Manhattan,

17:12.532 --> 17:15.668
I think a guilty plea
will settle things nicely.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.072
He'll plead to Criminal
Possession, Fourth Degree.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.708
So, one Class C felony
instead of two A-1's?

17:21.741 --> 17:22.709
He'd take the maximum.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.477
I... would?
Yeah.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.214
This is not Christmas, and I am
certainly not Santa Claus.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.182
Well, I'll save you
the trouble of a trial.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.850
It's no trouble.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.352
The drugs were found
in his refrigerator.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.387
Search warrant
was valid.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.190
His fingerprints
were all over the wrappers.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.458
Plus he gives you
a half-dozen dealers

17:38.491 --> 17:40.193
who buy from him
in upper Manhattan--

17:40.227 --> 17:42.195
Harlem to
Washington Heights.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.198
So he'd give us the guys
who buy from him?

17:45.232 --> 17:47.434
Names, addresses, times, places.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.170
Yeah, I think you forgot
what we do here.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.872
We give a deal to a little fish
who gives us a big fish,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.408
not the other way around.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.077
How about the people
he buys from?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.514
What, are you nuts?

18:01.548 --> 18:03.082
I like breathing.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.153
Looks like we're done here.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.428
Manhattan North Narcotics
says a guy, Otto Jackson,

18:15.462 --> 18:16.863
runs everything that
goes on up here.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.232
Those guys probably
all work for him.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.368
Looks like a narcotics
convention's going on.
Yeah.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.171
That's the pay phone
they made the 911 call from.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.472
Don't they all
use their cells?

18:25.505 --> 18:27.240
Ah, I guess so--
but they got eyes,

18:27.274 --> 18:29.542
so maybe we can get
some citizen cooperation.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.582
Hey! We're recruiting
for a new game show.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.649
Whoa! Hey! Come here!

18:36.683 --> 18:37.817
Come here...

18:37.850 --> 18:38.885
Don't worry,
this won't take long.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.520
It's called
Name That Tune.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.322
We're gonna play you a tape,
you're gonna tell us

18:42.355 --> 18:43.556
who's singing on it.
You got it?

18:43.590 --> 18:44.557
You busting me?

18:44.591 --> 18:47.560
Not yet.
Play the tape, Detective.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.762
MAN: There's a man
with a gun, he's robbing people

18:49.796 --> 18:51.398
at 122 Lenox.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.632
I just ran out of there.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.633
He's a bad-ass.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.634
Got a gun.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.935
Be careful.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.036
Look at how fast
your heart's pumping.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.172
I think you're ready to be
our grand prize winner.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.540
I don't know
who that is.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.909
Okay, empty your
pockets then.
You ain't got
no probable cause.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.844
You know what? We'll empty
your pockets-- cuff him.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.045
Yep. Come here.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.515
You got anything
sharp in there?
Okay, okay, okay! Okay!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.384
His name's Wendell.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.752
He lives...
he lives over there.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.521
First floor in the rear.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.622
Okay.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.224
He's kind of a dummy.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.659
Unlike yourself?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.328
Hey, I told you
what you want.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.729
You want your parting gift now?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.664
Yeah, please.
Thank you.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.732
(handcuffs rattling)

19:25.765 --> 19:27.267
Let's go see
Wendell.

19:43.583 --> 19:47.320
I'd appreciate it if you check
the attitude at the door, Frank.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.255
If it's all the same to you,

19:48.288 --> 19:50.323
I'd rather hang it
on the back of my chair.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.325
You need to talk to Potter.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.993
If he has names and addresses

19:54.026 --> 19:55.962
for the men who assaulted
my officers.

19:55.995 --> 19:59.599
Frank, the only way we're gonna
have that conversation,

19:59.632 --> 20:01.234
is to have the larger one first.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.403
Just try to put yourself
in his position;

20:03.436 --> 20:04.971
see things
from his perspective.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.673
A bunch of white cops
surrounded his church--

20:06.706 --> 20:07.974
Stop right there.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.976
It was a bunch of cops

20:10.009 --> 20:14.947
surrounding his church-- white,
black, Hispanic, female.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.285
Anyone who wants to paint my
department as being all white,

20:18.318 --> 20:20.553
all male, all the time,
had better check their facts.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.521
All right, Frank.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.989
No, it's not all right.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.725
Mr. Mayor,
I get real tired

20:25.758 --> 20:29.429
of seeing decades of progress
in the ranks ignored

20:29.462 --> 20:31.664
for the sake of
greasing the rhetoric.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.600
The cops who were
assaulted were white,

20:33.633 --> 20:35.702
the alleged perps were black--
that's all.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.304
"Be peaceful,
be courteous,

20:37.337 --> 20:40.440
"obey the law,
respect everyone.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.708
"But if someone
puts his hand on you,

20:41.741 --> 20:44.277
send him to the cemetery."

20:44.311 --> 20:45.612
Malcolm X.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.818
And hello to you,
too, Reverend.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.286
This is a vital summit,
Commissioner.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.054
Let's try to get off
on the right foot.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.656
Now it's a summit?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.791
I thought the three of us
could sit down.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.661
Okay. Fine.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.363
Let's start with
the names of the men

21:03.396 --> 21:04.831
who assaulted my officers.

21:04.864 --> 21:05.732
Frank...

21:05.765 --> 21:06.833
He makes conditions?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.034
If this is a summit,

21:08.067 --> 21:09.836
that's the first thing
on the agenda.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.038
We need to begin by
discussing the conditions

21:12.071 --> 21:14.073
that underlie the tensions
in my community

21:14.106 --> 21:15.308
vis-a-vis
your department.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.275
Two from your community

21:16.309 --> 21:18.945
shoved two from mine
down a flight of stairs.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.313
Frank, please...

21:20.347 --> 21:21.548
See what I'm
talking about?

21:21.581 --> 21:23.049
No willingness to work together,

21:23.082 --> 21:25.385
no interest
in building consensus.

21:26.919 --> 21:30.089
"A genuine leader
is not a seeker of consensus

21:30.122 --> 21:33.893
but a molder of consensus."

21:40.367 --> 21:42.301
Martin Luther King.

21:46.373 --> 21:49.809
I don't care if Frank Reagan
won't talk to me.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.011
I'm just one man.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.380
(supporters cheering,
shouting agreement)

21:53.413 --> 21:55.715
But this is an insult
to the community.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.949
(cheering, applause)

21:56.983 --> 21:59.085
To all of us.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.387
To all of you.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.253
(shouting, cheering)

22:01.287 --> 22:03.623
We supported Mayor Poole
in his election,

22:03.656 --> 22:05.024
and we demand

22:05.057 --> 22:08.728
that he remove Frank Reagan
as police commissioner.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.763
(applause and cheering on TV)

22:12.532 --> 22:15.368
Reagan must go!
MAN:
Yeah.

22:15.402 --> 22:16.736
Reagan must go!
Let 'em hear you.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.438
Reagan must go.
Let 'em hear you.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.406
Reagan must go!

22:19.439 --> 22:20.573
On time now.
Reagan must go!

22:20.607 --> 22:21.941
Let 'em hear you.
Reagan must go!

22:26.012 --> 22:29.449
And if he won't do that,
well, then guess what?

22:29.482 --> 22:30.517
CROWD:
What?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.919
We will remove Mayor Poole.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.655
Somebody needs to work
on his people skills.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.924
Nah, he's got 'em in
the palm of his hand.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.427
Oh, you meant me.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.729
(turns TV off)

22:42.762 --> 22:44.764
I know Potter takes himself
way too seriously,

22:44.797 --> 22:47.033
but that doesn't mean
you get to write him off.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.001
He's a sideshow, Garrett.
He doesn't matter.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.037
No. He matters
to the mayor.
Why?

22:51.070 --> 22:53.039
How many votes
could he possibly control?

22:53.072 --> 22:55.575
It was a close election,
and it always will be

22:55.608 --> 22:57.109
with a minority candidate
in this city.

22:57.143 --> 23:00.046
Plus, there may be
personal loyalty there.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.781
Both Potter and Poole
started out

23:01.814 --> 23:03.983
working in the same
anti-poverty programs.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.786
Which makes them, what, friends,
allies, strange bedfellows?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.521
Does it matter?
Garrett,

23:08.555 --> 23:12.492
I don't want to start a war
with the mayor.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.860
Who said you were?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.929
(sighs)

23:16.963 --> 23:18.164
Say something.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.032
We're getting a warrant

23:20.066 --> 23:22.769
to search Potter's church
and office.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.471
On second thought,

23:24.504 --> 23:26.005
don't say anything.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.074
The men we're looking for
are his people.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.042
He's withholding
information

23:30.076 --> 23:31.678
in a criminal investigation.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.980
To recap, you're in this mess

23:34.013 --> 23:35.915
because you invaded
Potter's church,

23:35.948 --> 23:38.885
so your next bright idea is
to invade it again?

23:38.918 --> 23:42.121
It will be the most polite
search in NYPD history.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.924
I've given strict instructions
to conduct it

23:44.957 --> 23:48.094
as if they were tossing
Mother Teresa's place.

23:50.963 --> 23:54.166
(sighs)

23:54.200 --> 23:56.636
MAN:
There's a man

23:56.669 --> 23:59.906
with a gun. He's robbing people
at 122 Lenox.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.108
I just ran out of there.
He's a bad-ass.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.643
Got a gun. Be careful.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.944
(recorder beeps off)

24:04.977 --> 24:06.112
So?

24:06.145 --> 24:08.815
I don't know.

24:08.848 --> 24:09.982
You don't know
what, Wendell?

24:10.016 --> 24:11.551
You don't know why
you made the call?

24:11.584 --> 24:13.185
I don't know.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.320
You got to know something.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.523
I mean, you must have had
a reason to make the call.

24:16.556 --> 24:19.526
I don't know.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.794
Okay, let me
make it easy for you.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.796
Do you know a guy named Otto?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.532
Uncle Otto.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.699
Uncle Otto?

24:26.733 --> 24:28.134
Otto's your uncle?

24:29.702 --> 24:31.037
Oh, okay.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.272
Did your Uncle Otto ask you
to make the call?

24:33.305 --> 24:37.076
You're supposed
to report crimes.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.045
That's what
they told us in school.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.880
(knocking)
Yeah?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.048
Kid's lawyer's here.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.650
What? Who called him?

24:43.683 --> 24:44.851
Take a wild stab.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.056
Sit tight.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.625
Mr. Maxwell,

24:52.659 --> 24:54.927
the attorney.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.896
Oh, you must be Uncle Otto.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.965
Where's my nephew,
detectives?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.534
You taking good
care of him?

25:01.568 --> 25:03.536
Well, we're doing about as
good as we can, considering

25:03.570 --> 25:04.871
his phony phone call
caused a riot.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.138
Which, if true,

25:06.172 --> 25:07.273
constitutes Falsely Reporting
an Incident

25:07.306 --> 25:08.841
in the Third Degree.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.109
Yeah, that's right.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.010
Which is a
misdemeanor.
Mm-hmm.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.945
Plus, he's a juvenile.
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.647
And you may have noticed that
he's also mentally challenged.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.949
Yeah, I noticed. I also noticed
that Uncle Otto is not

25:16.983 --> 25:19.018
mentally challenged.
Is there any particular reason

25:19.051 --> 25:20.052
you put your nephew up to this?

25:20.086 --> 25:21.053
Now, I'm sure

25:21.087 --> 25:23.690
my nephew hasn't said
any such crazy things.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.092
Come on, did you make the kid
make the phony phone call

25:26.125 --> 25:28.060
to cause problems with
Potter's church and the cops?

25:28.094 --> 25:30.262
Can we go see Wendell now?

25:31.798 --> 25:33.700
(sighs)
Go ahead.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.703
Come on.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.739
(sighs)

25:42.241 --> 25:44.977
Hey.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.113
(speaking quietly)

25:49.215 --> 25:51.984
POTTER:
Have you

25:52.018 --> 25:53.285
people no shame?

25:53.319 --> 25:54.854
Actually,
Reverend, yes.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.123
Uh, as a practicing
Catholic,

25:57.156 --> 26:00.126
I have a great and
deep sense of respect

26:00.159 --> 26:01.694
for, uh, any
house of worship.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.095
Then get out.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.330
Then give us the
names of the guys

26:04.363 --> 26:06.032
who pushed two New York
City police officers

26:06.065 --> 26:08.034
down a flight of stairs,
and we'll gladly go.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.702
I was prepared to discuss that
with the commissioner.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.870
It's my understanding

26:10.903 --> 26:13.339
the commissioner does not
negotiate police procedure.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.141
JACKIE:
Reverend, may we have

26:15.174 --> 26:17.109
your assistance
in opening this locked door?

26:17.143 --> 26:18.878
No, you may not.
This is outrageous.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.113
All right, well, if we're gonna
have to jack the lock,

26:21.147 --> 26:22.749
it's gonna take a minute,
and I'm sure

26:22.782 --> 26:24.817
you want us out of here
as swiftly as possible.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.218
My lawyer is on his way.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.054
Actually, uh,

26:28.087 --> 26:29.055
sorry, Reverend,
but, um...

26:29.088 --> 26:30.056
And stop with the "Reverend."

26:30.089 --> 26:31.157
When you say it,
it sounds...

26:31.190 --> 26:33.192
...but the execution of this
search warrant does not

26:33.225 --> 26:36.829
require us to wait for your
legal representation to arrive.

26:36.863 --> 26:40.199
And you cannot imagine what
a locksmith costs these days.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.634
JAMIE:
Detectives--

26:41.668 --> 26:44.136
got something.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.875
Right there.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.779
Church picnic?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.814
A prayer retreat,
upstate.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.415
Where Harriet Tubman
worshipped

26:56.448 --> 26:58.384
and conducted
the Underground Railroad.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.988
Helping hundreds of people
escape slavery and retreat 'em.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.123
Sounds like a nice retreat.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.226
That skinny guy right there.
Mmm-hmm.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.360
Ah, don't touch it,
Officer.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.962
It's church property.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.998
This guy with the earring?
Mmm-hmm.

27:12.031 --> 27:16.635
That's Shawn Hunter
and Nathan Bradley.

27:17.904 --> 27:20.139
Well, well, well,
any idea where

27:20.172 --> 27:24.176
we might be able to find
these gentlemen, Reverend?

27:30.216 --> 27:32.284
What's next, Frank?

27:32.318 --> 27:34.987
You gonna send a Strip-o-Gram
to his Sunday service?

27:38.991 --> 27:41.327
You heard from Reverend Potter.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.131
That search warrant was executed
for legitimate purposes.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.332
So this is nothing personal?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.000
Have you ever really listened

27:48.034 --> 27:49.902
to what he says
about this department?

27:49.936 --> 27:53.105
Frank, you're gonna have
to understand Potter.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.907
He comes from a
long tradition

27:54.941 --> 27:58.144
of polemicists who serve
as lightning rods to simply

27:58.177 --> 27:59.211
move the cause forward.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.412
At the end of the day,

28:00.446 --> 28:03.349
his vision of the Promised Land
is his own show on MSNBC.

28:03.382 --> 28:06.919
Okay, that is harsh.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.956
You're right. I'm sorry.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.291
Maybe...

28:12.324 --> 28:14.761
I just wanted it to be him.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.196
I'm not sure I'm following.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.966
I asked the Special Frauds team
at the DA's Office

28:19.999 --> 28:20.967
to give me what they had

28:21.000 --> 28:24.236
in ongoing investigations
involving Potter.

28:26.505 --> 28:30.009
$1.2 million in federal funds
unaccounted for

28:30.042 --> 28:33.512
from the West Harlem
Jobs Training Program

28:33.545 --> 28:36.515
which Potter started
along with...

28:36.548 --> 28:38.250
You're investigating me?

28:38.284 --> 28:40.219
Not at all.
But the two of you go way back.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.855
You drill down or Potter,
your name does tend to pop up.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.456
What else
were they looking into?

28:44.490 --> 28:45.958
Not for me to say.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.359
Ongoing investigation.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.261
I see.

28:49.295 --> 28:53.332
Well, Frank,
I don't know anything.

28:53.365 --> 28:56.068
Maybe nothing you can prove.

28:56.102 --> 28:59.305
Potter started out
as a good guy,

28:59.338 --> 29:02.975
but there were rumors:
no-show jobs,

29:03.009 --> 29:04.376
odd people hanging around.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.013
So I distanced myself.
I left those programs.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.081
I know that.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.987
One of those odd people

29:15.021 --> 29:17.790
a guy named Otto Jackson?

29:20.059 --> 29:22.428
Yeah. He and Potter
were pretty tight. Why?

29:22.461 --> 29:24.997
Just a name comes up.

29:25.031 --> 29:28.134
Really? In the D.A. files?

29:32.972 --> 29:36.442
There is no ongoing
investigation, is there?

29:36.475 --> 29:41.113
Well, I heard there was,

29:41.147 --> 29:43.215
but you'd have
to confirm that with the D.A.

29:43.249 --> 29:48.387
I have just been flipped
by an NYPD detective.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.822
Former detective.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.423
And sometimes we all need
a little push

29:51.457 --> 29:52.959
to do the right thing.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.961
I should fire you, Frank.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.563
You can, but you won't,
because you're a good man.

29:57.596 --> 30:02.334
And you... (scoffs)
are a pain in the ass.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.338
I'll take that as a compliment.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.254
Um, how'd you get that,
Uncle Jamie?

30:22.288 --> 30:25.057
I took a flight of stairs
with the wrong end of me.

30:25.091 --> 30:26.625
(laughter)

30:26.658 --> 30:27.559
You fell?

30:27.593 --> 30:29.395
I was pushed.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.597
Uncle Jamie and his partner
were pushed down some stairs.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.265
Really?

30:33.299 --> 30:35.134
Papers made it sound like
it was 'cause you were white.

30:35.167 --> 30:38.004
Nonsense.
It's because he was blue.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.439
The uniform.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.109
What happened is there
were some black men

30:43.142 --> 30:44.576
who thought that
the white cops

30:44.610 --> 30:45.644
were trespassing
in their church.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.446
Were they?

30:47.479 --> 30:49.315
No, they weren't.
They were doing their job.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.218
Well, that
doesn't always matter.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.953
Shouldn't Grandpa have sent
black cops instead?

30:53.986 --> 30:55.587
Should all your teachers be
white just

30:55.621 --> 30:57.356
'cause you are?
And your coaches?

30:57.389 --> 30:58.991
That would be stupid.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.193
It's called "segregation,"
and it is dumb.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.029
All this stuff is very
complicated, you know?

31:03.062 --> 31:04.931
I mean, on the one hand,
you got white cops

31:04.964 --> 31:06.532
who walk the beat
in black neighborhoods,

31:06.565 --> 31:08.500
and you know, sometimes
they feel like

31:08.534 --> 31:10.202
not everybody trusts 'em
just 'cause they're white.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.071
You got black kids who
feel like a white cop's

31:12.104 --> 31:13.405
gonna ask them just
because they're black.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.474
It's happened a million times
in this country.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.944
DANNY: But I am an equal
opportunity cop.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.246
I don't care what color you are,
what race you are.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.647
You break the law,
I'm breaking your head.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.915
(chuckles)

31:22.949 --> 31:24.216
Danny!
(laughter)

31:24.250 --> 31:26.418
Gandhi speaks.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.321
So, how do we make
it better?

31:29.355 --> 31:31.490
LINDA:
One decent person
at a time.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.193
You put a knock on anybody
who talks trash like that.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.694
Remember this:

31:35.727 --> 31:37.663
white, black, blue, purple--

31:37.696 --> 31:40.332
we're all the same color
on the inside.

31:40.366 --> 31:43.702
And in every gospel sermon
and prayer in every church,

31:43.735 --> 31:48.574
temple and mosque, it all
boils down to one sentence:

31:48.607 --> 31:50.409
go out of here and treat

31:50.442 --> 31:51.944
everybody you meet
a little better.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.279
Amen.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.981
And pass the potatoes.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.617
So is our mayor still on
the fence about this?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.619
You know, I really
think he'd like

32:00.652 --> 32:02.621
to see Reverend Potter gone,

32:02.654 --> 32:05.391
but black on black,
he can't do it himself.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.194
So he's gonna send in the
white police commissioner?

32:08.227 --> 32:11.697
Can't call the fire department.
He's not on fire.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.000
(all chuckle)

32:14.033 --> 32:17.636
Who wants the last lamb chop?
Nobody? Okay, pass it on down.

32:17.669 --> 32:21.507
DANNY:
One lamb chop coming up.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.642
It's a beauty.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.112
So how does the white police
commissioner get rid

32:26.145 --> 32:27.679
of the rabble-rousing minister?

32:27.713 --> 32:30.182
Well, you start by
nailing him for the
phony 911 call,

32:30.216 --> 32:31.750
which was only done
to give Potter

32:31.783 --> 32:33.185
something to rant about.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.654
Wait, he made the phony
911 call?

32:35.687 --> 32:36.588
Technically, no.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.624
But a drug dealer
and buddy of his did.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.559
How do you know
they were buddies?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.694
I don't know.
Dad dug it up.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.464
Why would a drug dealer
do a favor for Potter?

32:45.497 --> 32:47.633
He's the one that kicked them
out of the neighborhood.
No...

32:47.666 --> 32:49.501
supposedly he kicked them
out of the neighborhood.

32:49.535 --> 32:50.769
You never know with
a guy like Potter.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.272
It could have all just been
a P.R. stunt.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.341
Especially when it comes
to this Otto guy.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.743
Otto Jackson?

32:58.744 --> 33:00.279
You know him?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.015
What, is he your dealer
or something?

33:03.049 --> 33:04.583
No, I heard his name
the other day.

33:04.616 --> 33:08.220
Defense attorneys offer him up
as part of a plea bargain.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.022
Great. Why don't
you take it?

33:10.056 --> 33:13.625
Look, you get this guy
to roll on Otto--

33:13.659 --> 33:15.761
then we can use that to flip
Otto against Potter.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.630
I already turned him down.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.566
My case is solid.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.602
Plus, this lawyer is
this smug jerk

33:23.635 --> 33:25.604
who just hits on me
all the time.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.139
Well, you know,
you don't necessarily

33:27.173 --> 33:28.574
have to give the client a deal.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.410
You could, you know,
sleep with the lawyer.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.179
Come on, sis.

33:33.212 --> 33:37.516
You got to learn how to take one
for the team once in a while.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.326
And the doctor says
I'm all good now.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.529
Takes more than one flight down
to crack this thick skull.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.464
Marie's on her way up
to get me now.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.333
You need to have your head
examined again, Sarge.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.068
Going home's supposed
to be the good news.

33:56.102 --> 34:00.806
Yeah, except now I got to eat
her cooking again.

34:00.839 --> 34:03.142
It's like dog food.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.344
Hey. If it isn't
Humpty and Dumpty.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.712
Hey.
Hey.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.580
You're talking to a wounded
member of service here.

34:08.614 --> 34:09.781
Nice try, Sarge.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.650
Doc told me
your head cracked the stairs,

34:11.683 --> 34:12.684
not the other way around.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.586
He's funny.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.589
Yeah, I was going to bring you
some flowers, but instead

34:17.623 --> 34:19.225
I brought something
for you, Jamie.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.428
What's this?
Well, once we got the names

34:22.461 --> 34:23.862
of the goons
that did this to you,

34:23.895 --> 34:25.864
TARU traced their cells.
They're holed up in in Midtown.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.633
Since you can I.D.
them, I was wondering

34:27.666 --> 34:29.435
if you want to come hit
their door with me.

34:29.468 --> 34:31.637
Yeah.
Yeah? Good.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.639
What do you say, Sarge?
Mind if I take the kid,

34:33.672 --> 34:35.774
show him how the
real cops work?
Go ahead, knock yourself out.

34:35.807 --> 34:38.177
Just don't forget
what you learned.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.745
Good night, Sarge.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.219
Get on the ground!

34:47.253 --> 34:48.354
Go! Go!

34:48.387 --> 34:49.655
Easy, my man.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.157
Get your hands up!

34:51.190 --> 34:53.359
We got the guy
with the earring.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.693
Come on, bring him out.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.862
Come on,
bring him out!

34:56.895 --> 34:59.831
OFFICER:
Bedroom clear.
Check the back.

34:59.865 --> 35:03.369
Kitchen clear.
Let's go.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.704
What do you say, kid?
Second bedroom clear!

35:05.737 --> 35:07.839
These guys look like the guys?
Yeah, that's the guys.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.775
You gentlemen remember
this officer here?

35:09.808 --> 35:11.677
I want my lawyer.
You want your lawyer?

35:11.710 --> 35:14.213
How about we get you
a doctor instead?

35:14.246 --> 35:16.348
What you going to do, throw us
down the stairs now?

35:16.382 --> 35:18.817
I don't know, you threw my
kid brother down the stairs.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.820
What do
you say?
No, it's the wrong century.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.855
It's a kinder, gentler NYPD.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.292
Be glad he's
the forgiving type.

35:26.325 --> 35:27.759
Let's go.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.866
A message from you
at 10:00 last night.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.902
I hope I didn't miss
a drunk dial.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.941
I'm taking your deal, Larry.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.311
And what happened to you
not being Santa Claus?

35:45.344 --> 35:49.315
We have a backlog here, and I
have more serious cases, so...

35:49.348 --> 35:51.850
No. There's something going on.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.652
You want the deal
or not, Larry?

35:53.685 --> 35:55.387
Sure. Done.

35:55.421 --> 35:57.856
Your guy supplies
evidence sufficient

35:57.889 --> 35:59.725
the half dozen dealers

35:59.758 --> 36:01.927
including one Otto Jackson.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.662
Done, done and doner.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.897
All right. I'll
draw up the papers.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.801
Does this mean you'll
come see my apartment, too?

36:11.370 --> 36:13.539
(chuckles)

36:25.917 --> 36:27.519
All right.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.655
There's the good
Reverend Potter.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.657
You ready
to go, Otto?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.892
That son of a bitch.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.628
Aw, man, Harten, I swear,

36:36.662 --> 36:38.730
I'm gonna kill him!

36:38.764 --> 36:40.666
Hey, you do remember you're
wearing a wire, right?

36:40.699 --> 36:43.635
I'm kidding, all right?
I'm just kidding.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.737
Let's go over it again.

36:45.771 --> 36:48.440
Look, man, I've been through it
with juries six times already.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.476
I know what I'm
supposed to say.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.244
You know it when
I say you know it.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.279
Let's go over it again.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.817
I go inside the restaurant.
Right.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.886
I sit down with Potter.
Right.

37:00.919 --> 37:04.790
Get him to talk about the 911
call-- how he asked me to do it.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.693
And then, you know,
how he wanted to cause trouble

37:07.726 --> 37:09.695
and get his face back
on the front pages...

37:09.728 --> 37:10.629
Front pages again, exactly.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.264
And you're going to keep
on talking until...?

37:12.298 --> 37:13.865
Until he admits to it.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.835
Right. And if you don't
get him to admit to it?

37:16.868 --> 37:19.905
20 years in Attica.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.573
I kind of like you, Otto.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.275
I hope you don't
screw this up.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.976
All right, time to go.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.245
Bon appetit.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.868
(reporters clamoring,
calling to Potter)

37:49.901 --> 37:50.802
Is it true that you've
been caught on tape

37:50.836 --> 37:52.804
admitting to setting up
the false 911 call?

37:52.838 --> 37:54.973
No comment.
Who did you tell to make
the call, and why?

37:55.006 --> 37:57.309
No comment.
Do you have any words
for the police officers...

37:57.343 --> 37:59.678
(over TV):
whose lives you endangered?

37:59.711 --> 38:01.880
How do you explain...
WOMAN:
Reverend Potter...

38:01.913 --> 38:05.717
First time that fella's
ever been speechless.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.820
The press is having
a field day.

38:08.854 --> 38:11.923
That recording found its way
to every media outlet in town.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.359
How the hell
did that happen?

38:13.392 --> 38:14.860
Good question.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.429
The mayor made a statement.
One sentence,

38:17.463 --> 38:22.033
about how Potter is having no
official or unofficial role

38:22.067 --> 38:23.969
in his campaign
or his administration.

38:24.002 --> 38:27.873
Distancing himself.
Distancing him,
like, to Cleveland.

38:27.906 --> 38:31.042
And Potter's office says
he's out on a...

38:31.076 --> 38:32.110
Spiritual sabbatical.

38:32.143 --> 38:36.047
You know, I heard an interview
with Bernie Williams

38:36.081 --> 38:38.984
this morning on the radio,
as I was coming in.

38:39.017 --> 38:42.053
Turns out he's the first guy
to win the batting title,

38:42.087 --> 38:44.923
the Golden Glove,
and the World Series ring

38:44.956 --> 38:47.693
all in the same year.
I know that.

38:47.726 --> 38:49.995
Know what he does now?
What?

38:50.028 --> 38:52.030
Plays guitar.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.600
Well enough to record
on a major label.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.968
Turns out he's been playing
almost as long

38:57.002 --> 38:58.704
as he played baseball.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.939
Good for him.
What's your point?

39:00.972 --> 39:03.041
Who said I had a point?

39:03.074 --> 39:04.109
You always have a point.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.512
Scratch that-- you always think
you have a point.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.947
Okay, how many times have
I heard you go on about,

39:08.980 --> 39:10.616
you've got no talent
or taste for politics.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.150
And I was watching

39:12.183 --> 39:14.420
this week, and lo and behold,

39:14.453 --> 39:17.589
you've got a talent
for politics.

39:17.623 --> 39:21.092
Up to and including today's
little turn of events.

39:21.126 --> 39:24.830
You won't find my fingerprints
on that leak, ever.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.432
It's as if Bernie Williams

39:26.465 --> 39:28.400
stepped up to the
plate as a Yankee

39:28.434 --> 39:32.137
and instead of swinging a bat,
picked up a Stratocaster

39:32.170 --> 39:33.705
and whipped off
the Hendrix version of

39:33.739 --> 39:36.575
"The Star-Spangled
Banner"-- I mean...

39:36.608 --> 39:37.909
who knew?

39:39.745 --> 39:42.814
I think you could make
a run for mayor.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.484
Seriously.

39:45.517 --> 39:49.120
Keep that thought to yourself.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.156
Seriously.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.459
You got to admit,

39:53.492 --> 39:56.462
Gracie Mansion would be
a nice place to retire from.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.930
I like it just fine,
right where I am.
