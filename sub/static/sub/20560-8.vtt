00:21.563 --> 00:23.440
[theme music playing]

02:07.127 --> 02:08.044
You're alive.

02:08.128 --> 02:13.091
Philosophically arguable, but...
physically, yes, I am.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.884
I don't understand.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.344
We felt you die.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.973
I remember the sound of bone saw.
Then nothing.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.017
So you could be a Bolger.
He could be a zombie.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.895
I believe that was the intention
of our friend over there.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.899
I think you're the first cluster
to get this close to Whispers.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.152
You continue to impress, Officer Gorski.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.697
Wait, if Whispers wanted you lobotomized,
then who stopped the surgery?

02:35.780 --> 02:38.700
The only person in BPO
with more power than him.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.618
-Are you talking about--
-The Chairman.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.748
As you can see,
my status is much improved.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.836
A deal with the devil? I'm afraid so.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.463
I didn't think I could be
any more confused by you,

02:52.547 --> 02:54.674
but congratulations, you found a way.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.968
I think both of you can understand
that right now,

02:57.051 --> 02:58.970
I'm doing what I have to do to survive.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.099
-Okay, Jonas is alive?
-Apparently so.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.851
I'm totally confused.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.436
I don't understand.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.605
Obviously, the Chairman was working
with Whispers...

03:08.688 --> 03:11.774
-...when he took out Croome.
-But why would he want to save Jonas...

03:11.858 --> 03:14.569
-...if Whispers ordered the surgery?
-The Chairman needs Whispers.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.614
-He doesn't trust him.
-Which is why he needs Jonas.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.784
That's it. The Chairman needs Whispers
for the zombie project.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.369
Hashtag: disposable assassins.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.664
Which he uses to eliminate
his political opposition.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.499
Mitchell Taylor. RIP.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.502
What we need to understand is
what does Whispers get out of all of this?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.504
The secret of Whispers
is still to be solved.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.467
But assuming for the moment that Whispers
does have a separate agenda...

03:37.550 --> 03:39.594
That would explain why the Chairman
doesn't trust him.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.180
And why he would secretly save Jonas.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.849
Because he knew Jonas
is connected to Whispers.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.476
He needs a watchdog.

03:46.559 --> 03:50.313
It's a painful irony,
but my life is tied to Whispers.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.943
-[sips]
-[helicopter approaching]

04:00.365 --> 04:02.116
-I'm sorry.
-Goddamn it.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.535
Will, no. No, stop.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.580
-This is our last chance!
-If they put a bullet in you, it will be.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.518
Where you going?

04:29.227 --> 04:32.730
-In every fight...
-...mistakes are made.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.423
Is Jonas still here?

04:59.465 --> 05:03.011
-No. The blockers kicked in.
-Good.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.031
-[beeps]
-[lock clicks]

05:24.782 --> 05:26.409
How did you remember that?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.580
I like safes.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.683
Mandiba has made a crucial mistake
underestimating you.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.353
And the power of social media.
We're getting a huge number of hits.

05:54.437 --> 05:58.399
We've done some preliminary polls
and you are gaining on him.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.611
Oh, yeah. Vote Van Damn, he's our man.

06:01.694 --> 06:05.698
Mandiba has started spending money,
trying to recover his reputation.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.993
-These are all over Nairobi.
-What?

06:09.077 --> 06:11.871
-Mandiba was pals with Nelson Mandela?
-It's fake.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.749
-Mandiba photoshopped himself in.
-But people believe it.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.335
-Is this legal?
-Mandiba doesn't care.

06:17.418 --> 06:21.130
He's on trial for corruption.
This is small potatoes.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.841
But what it demonstrates
is his desperation.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.384
He's afraid of you.

06:25.468 --> 06:29.639
Yeah. He's an evildoer. You know
all evildoers are afraid of Van Damn.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.101
These ads started running yesterday.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.269
-He's a thug.
-A thug.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.354
He's a thug.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.857
Extortionist! To ride his bus,
you have to pay a safety tax.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.946
I was there. I watched him beat
this old guy who wouldn't pay his tax.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.614
He works for the water company.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.284
He put his fist through this guy's face.
I mean, the guy's scary.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.912
I saw him drive on the sidewalk.
He just didn't care.

06:52.995 --> 06:58.709
Vote for Van Damn and all of Kibera
will be paying his safety tax.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.838
[scoffs] This is bullshit.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.381
This is politics.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.841
And politics is war.

07:04.924 --> 07:10.346
Which is why we feel that additional
security precautions must be taken.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.852
This is Fred Kimafi.
He's our new security advisor.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.603
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Hello.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.232
[laughs] He doesn't need security.
Van Damn is security.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.985
It's, as he said, a precaution.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.153
Why?

07:25.945 --> 07:28.656
Because if anything
should ever happen to you,

07:28.739 --> 07:31.826
no one will ever be brave enough
to stand up to Mandiba again.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.128
Good morning.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.589
As if it matters.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.679
Lito. Lito, don't do it.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.598
Don't forget that every bite
is the equivalent

07:53.681 --> 07:55.016
of 20 minutes on the treadmill.

07:55.099 --> 07:58.186
We're actors.
Rejection is nine-tenths of our job.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.314
What job? I don't have a job.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.734
And I can't get a job
because I don't have an agent.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.569
Why don't I have an agent?

08:07.278 --> 08:10.531
Because he could see
what you both refuse to see.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.786
One of these days, that shit-for-brains
is going to realize that dropping you

08:15.870 --> 08:18.623
was the sorriest, stupidest mistake
he's ever made.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.170
Not a mistake. It's not a mistake, Dani.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.630
It's a reality.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.050
They accepted it. And I have accepted it.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.801
Now you two have to.

08:30.885 --> 08:34.889
Don't you believe what you said
in SÃ£o Paulo? That we make our reality?

08:35.473 --> 08:39.644
Hernando...
how many gay action stars are there?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.562
No, let me rephrase.

08:41.646 --> 08:45.441
How many out gay action stars are now,

08:45.525 --> 08:49.153
or will be employed this year
or the foreseeable future? I'll tell you.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.656
I'll tell you. It's a nice round number.

08:54.784 --> 08:55.952
Zero.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.579
Zero.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.458
As in my future prospects.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.628
From hero to zero.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.216
Put that on my tombstone.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.242
Lito?

09:37.451 --> 09:38.411
Lito?

09:39.453 --> 09:40.621
What are you doing?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.124
I'm practicing.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.126
For what?

09:46.002 --> 09:49.088
For my future as a homeless,
unemployable failure.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.847
Wait. Sun. Sun.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.613
Where is this place?

10:13.696 --> 10:16.616
They call them love motels.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.662
[Lito] Oh.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.706
Oh. Oh, yeah.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.500
Sure.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.173
[sighs] Sun.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.816
[sobbing]

11:02.119 --> 11:03.537
Why are you here?

11:08.542 --> 11:10.795
I don't know. [exhales]

11:11.128 --> 11:12.588
[sobbing]

11:12.672 --> 11:16.258
I don't know what I'm doing. [cries]

11:22.681 --> 11:23.933
Stop crying.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.438
Why?

11:30.940 --> 11:33.067
Because it's not that bad.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.155
You don't know that. You don't--

11:38.239 --> 11:42.827
I'm sorry, Sun, but you can't understand
what it's like to lose everything.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.994
I can't?

11:44.703 --> 11:48.541
No, I lost my manager. I lost my agent.

11:48.624 --> 11:52.378
I lost my Instagram followers,
my Twitter followers.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.588
-I've lost--
-Shut up!

11:57.716 --> 11:59.885
You have a man who loves you.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.431
And you have a friend who was willing
to give up her life for you.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.599
And you have a mother who accepts you.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.477
That is true.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.397
And what do I have?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.068
My parents are dead.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.990
And my only brother will kill me
if I don't kill him first.

12:22.491 --> 12:26.162
If anyone should be on the bed crying,
it should be me.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.583
But you will never do that.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.004
Of course not.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.841
Maybe that's why I'm here, Sun.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.351
[sobbing] Come on, come on.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.444
Here.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.270
I need your advice.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.694
While I am keenly aware that my husband

14:21.777 --> 14:23.988
has not been
completely forthcoming with me

14:24.071 --> 14:26.282
in regards to his business practices,

14:26.365 --> 14:30.369
I also know that I have not been
as honest as I could have been.

14:30.452 --> 14:34.748
At first, I was absolutely certain
that not telling Rajan about the...

14:35.833 --> 14:37.960
things, you know, going on in my head,

14:38.043 --> 14:40.838
including the fact that I'm a different
species of human being altogether,

14:40.921 --> 14:42.590
were things better kept to myself.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.925
But now, I am not so sure.

14:45.801 --> 14:49.889
And here is the heart of the matter:
I believe Rajan is a good man.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.976
Though I say this as something I know
I am less certain of than I was before.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.021
Separate issue: as a police officer,
you must have sensed

14:57.104 --> 14:59.565
there was something completely
untrustworthy about that Lila, didn't you?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.317
It wasn't just me, was it?

15:01.400 --> 15:04.528
-Yeah, she seemed--
-Exactly. Yeah. I felt the same.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.530
Here. Lick this.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.912
Hmm...

15:12.995 --> 15:16.665
So, rather than allowing myself
to be paralyzed by doubt,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.667
a mistake I have made in the past,

15:18.751 --> 15:22.588
I am considering a more, you know,
proactive approach, like you or Sun,

15:22.671 --> 15:25.049
and simply telling Rajan everything.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.593
You know, I mean,
everything that is going on with me

15:27.676 --> 15:31.013
and then asking him
what exactly is going on with him.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.098
Which, frankly,
I am not sure I even want to know,

15:33.182 --> 15:36.185
but can any marriage
really survive secret-keeping?

15:44.777 --> 15:45.986
Uh...

15:46.487 --> 15:50.824
Do you want to tell him everything
in order to make him tell you everything?

15:50.908 --> 15:54.745
Or do you want to tell him
because you're in love with someone else?

15:59.708 --> 16:01.043
[clears throat softly]

16:01.126 --> 16:03.921
[stutters] Your thiamine is low

16:04.004 --> 16:07.299
and the lack of iron
is affecting your adrenals,

16:07.383 --> 16:08.759
which is why you're craving the drugs.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.679
Heroin is not going help you figure out
how to find Whispers.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.599
You need to eat properly,
take your medicine, and focus.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.438
Yeah.

16:25.901 --> 16:26.819
You will be fine.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.031
Hey.

16:33.617 --> 16:34.868
So will you.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.710
[indistinct chatter]

16:43.377 --> 16:45.295
[Jela chuckles]

16:45.379 --> 16:47.673
Ah, look at you.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.384
Wow.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.973
When you get elected, I hope you
don't forget about your friends.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.145
[laughs]

17:01.228 --> 17:02.646
[speaks Swahili]

17:49.068 --> 17:52.071
-You all right?
-I used to feel so sure.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.614
Of what?

17:53.697 --> 17:54.907
Of everything.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.202
I'm starting to think
this is a terrible idea.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.120
You said we needed to find the Assistant.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.457
You said this was the best place to start.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.958
Is that him?

18:06.585 --> 18:10.380
Hey, Officer Strange, you coming?

18:11.924 --> 18:12.841
Come on.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.021
[Felix] You want to hit me, don't you?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.147
Huh?

18:27.815 --> 18:28.982
You want to hit me?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.276
Pay me back, huh?

18:32.486 --> 18:34.905
Do it. Just do it, huh?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.325
We gotta get out of here, man.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.702
Fuck all this shit.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.581
This isn't us, Wolfie.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.341
Hey, what's up, D?
I thought you were off today.

18:54.424 --> 18:58.137
Uh, yeah. This is a friend.
Looking for a missing person.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.475
There's my desk.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.645
That was his desk?

19:09.481 --> 19:10.524
It was.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.694
No more. That's, uh...
that's Officer Boyd.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.780
-What's up, Sasha?
-Hey, Diego.

19:16.864 --> 19:17.698
Chillin'.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.963
What are we doing here?

19:33.714 --> 19:35.507
Let's just go back to the shop.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.969
To making keys, saving damsels.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.226
I'm going to tell Fuchs to stuff
this gilded cage straight up his ass.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.269
Don't.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.314
Why?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.861
I have to take care of something first.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.460
Okay. We do this by the book.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.670
-Is he here?
-He's--

20:13.754 --> 20:16.715
Then get this straight.
None of your cowboy bullshit--

20:16.798 --> 20:18.425
Okay, he's there.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.845
I don't care. I just need him to know
we do this by the rules.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.264
Technically, it's against the rules
to have her in here.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.560
-What? What did he say?
-Nothing.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.270
Yeah.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.984
Why do you think she would be listed
as a missing person?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.486
We know she was scared.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.488
We know she went through a lot of trouble
to meet with you.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.365
-Which means that--
-Whoever's after you

20:41.448 --> 20:42.783
is probably after her.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.624
He's a good cop.

20:52.793 --> 20:56.129
It also means they're gonna come after
anyone who tries to help us.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.553
What'd he say?

21:05.889 --> 21:07.266
He's just worried about you.

21:09.977 --> 21:16.525
Well, thank you, ghost cop, but, uh...
I can take care of myself.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.265
-[thumps]
-Hmm?

21:49.141 --> 21:52.519
-[Rajan] Fuck. Damn it.
-Rajan.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.064
-Rajan! Oh, my God!
-It's nothing.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.524
-Sit.
-What happened?

21:57.607 --> 22:00.152
-A small accident. Everything's fine.
-Should I call the doctor?

22:00.235 --> 22:02.612
No, it's a small accident.
Tell her it's fine.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.782
-[man] It isn't bad, ma'am.
-I thought your job was to protect him!

22:05.866 --> 22:07.451
[Rajan] It was my fault.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.286
-You know how clumsy I can be.
-[Kala] Oh, my God!

22:09.369 --> 22:12.664
It's stupid even talking about it.
I've just been working too many hours.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.166
[Kala] Put your head up.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.834
[Rajan] I'm embarrassed as it is.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.836
-Please, let me just clean up, okay?
-Rajan, I--

22:17.919 --> 22:19.546
-Ah!
-If you need anything--

22:19.629 --> 22:20.797
-Yeah.
-I'll be with him.

22:20.881 --> 22:21.840
[Rajan] Fuck.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.218
He's lying.

22:26.595 --> 22:31.433
But it's okay, because without lies,
life would be too hard.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.396
No. No.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.232
-Without what lies?
-[TV playing indistinctly]

22:40.484 --> 22:41.485
In the movie.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.071
Too many lies.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.655
From Here to Eternity.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.078
[sighs]

22:53.830 --> 22:54.998
Uh-oh.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.627
Why, "Uh-oh"?

22:59.920 --> 23:02.255
First, chocolate fudge brownie,
and now this.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.716
What are we watching?

23:05.300 --> 23:07.636
From Here to Eternity.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.805
Ooh! Scoot, scoot.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.058
-It's Stella's favorite film.
-Your mom?

23:13.600 --> 23:14.643
Yeah.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.978
My mother had a copy on VHS.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.566
She and my aunts watched it to death.

23:23.527 --> 23:27.072
When it was on,
nothing else mattered to them.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.616
Mom, see me?

23:29.699 --> 23:30.826
[orchestral music plays]

23:30.909 --> 23:32.202
Lito!

23:37.207 --> 23:40.877
Burt Lancaster had this... power.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.963
Oh, I get that.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.801
[Lito] They all wanted to be her.

23:53.723 --> 23:57.853
Did you want Burt to kiss
and drip on you, too?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.105
No.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.150
Maybe.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.996
[woman in movie] He was drunk
when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

24:16.079 --> 24:17.497
I was lying on the floor.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.749
Oh, this moment is amazing.

24:19.833 --> 24:24.838
The confession of her secret,
her truth bringing him to his knees,

24:24.921 --> 24:26.506
asking to be forgiven.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.552
Empathy overwhelming his male jealousy.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.596
What? How do you see that?
I can't see that.

24:32.679 --> 24:36.016
Please just stop talking about it.
I don't want to talk about it.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.559
-Okay.
-I don't want to talk about it.

24:37.642 --> 24:38.852
-Okay.
-I just want to watch.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.771
-Okay. Okay, sorry.
-Sorry.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.150
Karen, listen to me. Listen.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.651
[Karen] I know.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.362
Until I met you, I didn't think...

24:49.446 --> 24:51.573
[whispers] Lito watches it
when he's depressed.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.574
I don't get it.

24:52.657 --> 24:56.161
Why would he watch his mother's
favorite film when he's depressed?

25:03.001 --> 25:04.711
I have a theory.

25:10.967 --> 25:15.597
I think this is the film where Lito
became aware of the power of acting.

25:16.473 --> 25:20.685
I imagine the effect Burt Lancaster had
on his mother and aunties...

25:21.269 --> 25:23.271
must have felt like a kind of magic.

25:24.231 --> 25:28.902
But at the same time,
he was probably beginning to suspect

25:28.985 --> 25:32.864
that he was different from a man
like Burt Lancaster

25:32.948 --> 25:35.450
in very significant ways.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.952
You mean he's gay?

25:38.995 --> 25:40.247
Exactly.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.251
Which would naturally create
some complex insecurities:

25:44.334 --> 25:48.922
wanting to do and be everything
that a heteronormative icon

25:49.005 --> 25:51.758
such as Burt Lancaster
was able to do and be...

25:52.467 --> 25:54.386
but knowing that it was not possible.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.139
Yeah, but he's gonna do more.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.641
Way more.

25:59.724 --> 26:04.271
Have you seen the pictures from SÃ£o Paulo?
They're everywhere. They're blowing up.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.107
I know, but right now,
Lito can't see any of it.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.442
He believes his career is over.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.736
That's why he's grieving.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.706
You okay?

26:24.499 --> 26:26.293
I can't go on like this much longer.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.599
You're so smart, Hernando.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.184
But you're so wrong.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.688
I'm not grieving a career.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.899
It was my dream.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.236
And now it's over.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.761
Every time I walk by this place,
I remember that day.

27:17.844 --> 27:21.014
You were in the middle of the crowd.
Everyone was like, "Van Damn! Van Damn!"

27:21.097 --> 27:22.849
And it was like straight out of a--

27:27.437 --> 27:29.356
[Jela laughs]

27:30.231 --> 27:32.400
This shit is getting real!

27:34.903 --> 27:35.987
Wow.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.080
-[Nomi] Sun!
-[gasps]

27:46.289 --> 27:47.999
Oh! Don't hit me!

27:49.125 --> 27:51.044
-[sighs]
-I'm sorry I woke you.

27:51.669 --> 27:54.172
I get completely confused with time zones.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.465
What do you want?

27:55.548 --> 27:57.133
The Bak Summer Gala.

27:57.884 --> 27:59.427
-Joong-Ki canceled it.
-No.

28:00.136 --> 28:02.180
The police tried
to convince him to cancel,

28:02.263 --> 28:04.391
but it looks like there's
so much money coming in

28:04.474 --> 28:06.309
from Tokyo, London and Abu Dhabi,

28:06.393 --> 28:09.938
your brother sent a memo today
telling everyone he'll be there.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.607
Which means it is so on.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.901
But there will be a lot of security.

28:14.984 --> 28:17.695
Oh, yeah, there will be major,
insane security.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.114
-[Amanita] Is that Sun?
-[Nomi] Mm-hmm.

28:20.824 --> 28:21.908
And Lito.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.621
-Lito? What's he doing here?
-I don't know.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.872
[Lito sighs]

28:27.956 --> 28:29.833
I think he's depressed.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.086
How will I get in
if they will be expecting me?

28:33.169 --> 28:36.256
We first considered hacking an invite,
but because the police set-up

28:36.339 --> 28:38.258
is concentrated on the people
coming through the front door...

28:38.341 --> 28:40.260
Security is so performative.

28:40.343 --> 28:43.513
From what we can tell,
they're not even checking the staff.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.223
Just like the TSA.

28:45.306 --> 28:49.144
Which means,
we found a back door, literally.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.104
The fake ID is a breeze.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.523
There is only one little problem...

28:54.816 --> 28:56.693
Do you know anything about tending bar?

28:57.318 --> 28:58.445
No, nothing.

28:59.654 --> 29:00.780
She doesn't, does she?

29:00.864 --> 29:03.491
-Shit.
-Shit.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.995
[cocktail shaker rattling]

29:10.457 --> 29:11.708
Oh...

29:15.420 --> 29:16.504
What?

29:17.756 --> 29:21.217
It's Lito. Flair bartending.

29:25.305 --> 29:28.308
For six months, I trained
with the best bartenders in all Mexico.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.684
Oh, my God.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.895
For my role in Blood-Stained Tequila.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.358
[Lito sobs]

29:56.377 --> 29:57.837
Relaxing, isn't it?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.257
I feel I can talk to you, Wolfgang.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.718
I need your advice.

30:05.345 --> 30:10.683
I know you know what's going on,
how delicate the situation is.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.311
-It's not my business.
-No.

30:13.394 --> 30:15.480
And I appreciate that about you, but...

30:17.065 --> 30:20.944
this is about Lila,
and the way she talks about you.

30:21.444 --> 30:24.030
I think she is your business.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.158
Does she ever talk about me?

30:32.747 --> 30:33.748
Not really.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.672
[sighs] Maybe I'm getting older.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.304
I care for Lila a great deal.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.727
She's not like other women.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.147
Aww...

30:58.231 --> 31:01.317
I love listening to men trying
to express their feelings.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.529
I think you can understand
that I have thought about marrying her.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.156
Was that before or after
you came inside me?

31:08.241 --> 31:12.745
Do you believe you can ever
really know someone?

31:14.163 --> 31:15.331
Some people.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.459
Do you think you know me?

31:19.627 --> 31:21.546
I have friends at the NSA.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.464
Here we go.

31:23.965 --> 31:28.511
I pay them a not-insignificant amount
of money to monitor certain cell lines.

31:29.804 --> 31:35.393
Recently, I received the transcripts
of a call that was...

31:37.353 --> 31:38.521
distressing.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.190
Oh, poor baby.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.653
I think she's going to betray me.

31:46.779 --> 31:49.282
Hmm. What did the transcript say?

31:52.702 --> 31:56.623
It was a call from Khalial,
one of my competitors.

31:58.416 --> 32:02.086
He was negotiating a contract on my life.

32:05.381 --> 32:06.883
He was talking to Lila.

32:10.303 --> 32:13.097
You know this city. You know this world.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.433
I'm not asking for you to get involved.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.396
I just need information.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.863
You were right about the difference
between us.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.450
I want to live as you live,
without a leash around my neck.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.664
Hello?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.627
Sebastian?

32:43.086 --> 32:45.797
Thank God.
Fredrick said you were with him.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.674
With who?

32:47.757 --> 32:50.259
I don't know what's going on.
I'm trying to understand it.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.804
I received a call from Khalial,
who's going to make a move on you.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.390
I played along
because I don't think it's his idea.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.600
I think someone is driving him.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.394
Who?

33:00.019 --> 33:00.979
Wolfgang.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.315
Sebastian, be careful.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.151
If something happened to you,
I don't know what I would do.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.779
It's all right. Everything's fine.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.906
Come home to me.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.034
See you later.

33:18.663 --> 33:19.747
I must go.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.251
I would like to continue
this conversation.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.752
I'll find you.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.976
I know you're angry...

33:41.144 --> 33:43.730
but this is how a girl like me
tells a boy like you

33:43.813 --> 33:45.481
that she has a crush on you.

33:46.774 --> 33:50.528
And instead of laying in bed,
wishing she was going out with you

33:50.611 --> 33:52.238
and not her current boyfriend...

33:53.406 --> 33:55.658
she has decided to do something about it.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.684
Sh...

34:42.538 --> 34:43.873
[Superpower] Far enough.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.136
So we meet again, eh, Van Damn?

34:57.220 --> 34:59.097
[chuckles]

35:01.307 --> 35:05.603
So, tell me, did that pretty girl
of yours turn you on to politics?

35:05.686 --> 35:07.522
Or you are Silas' bitch now?

35:07.605 --> 35:08.940
Why do you care?

35:13.027 --> 35:15.905
Just never figured you for doing something
as stupid as politics.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.406
I want to help.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.617
I want to change things.

35:21.577 --> 35:22.870
Change?

35:22.954 --> 35:24.956
People like what they're used to.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.251
People also want things to get better.

35:28.751 --> 35:29.794
[laughs]

35:30.670 --> 35:33.005
Someone is listening
to all the noise you make.

35:33.589 --> 35:36.926
-You and your lady should be careful.
-Is this is a warning?

35:38.511 --> 35:40.680
Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.765
He just comes for you.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.101
I could get offed just for talking to you.

35:46.686 --> 35:47.979
Why are you talking to me then?

35:49.480 --> 35:51.190
'Cause I still like you, Van Damn.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.738
I shouldn't.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.407
For what you did to me...

36:01.200 --> 36:02.660
I should have killed you.

36:04.287 --> 36:08.875
I was going to...
but then I heard everyone talk about it.

36:08.958 --> 36:12.086
Us. The new Rumble in the Jungle.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.671
Me and you.

36:13.754 --> 36:15.423
It's like Ali and Foreman.

36:17.800 --> 36:22.680
Separate, we are good...
Together, we are legendary.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.935
Maybe you should work for me.

36:30.813 --> 36:32.231
Bossman pays better.

36:34.942 --> 36:38.613
If you survive this, Van Damn,
you've got my vote.

36:47.455 --> 36:51.500
[Elizabeth, echoing] How long
are we talking about, Milton?

36:51.584 --> 36:53.294
You said a week or two...

36:53.377 --> 36:54.587
You said a week or two.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.714
Now it's a month or two.
Then what? A year or two?

36:56.797 --> 36:58.674
[overlapping voices echoing]

37:01.802 --> 37:03.596
It will take what it takes.

37:03.679 --> 37:06.557
What about us? What about this family?

37:07.141 --> 37:10.603
I am trying to protect this family.
These people are not like us. They are...

37:10.686 --> 37:11.938
...extremely dangerous.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.482
I hate it here! I hate it!

37:14.565 --> 37:16.609
-Chelsea.
-I want to go home!

37:16.692 --> 37:19.612
-Take her out of here.
-She's your daughter.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.198
I want to go home! I want to go home!

37:22.281 --> 37:24.742
I have to work. Get out. Go.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.535
-Leave me the...
-...fuck alone!

37:26.619 --> 37:27.745
-Chelsea, come.
-[voice echoing]

37:27.828 --> 37:29.705
Sometimes I don't know who you are!

37:29.789 --> 37:31.874
[voice echoing] Leave me the fuck alone!

37:31.958 --> 37:32.959
No.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.776
You're just as trapped as we are,
aren't you?

38:19.338 --> 38:21.173
[phone rings]

38:27.888 --> 38:29.807
[phone rings]

38:32.685 --> 38:33.936
[Lila] It's Sebastian.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.857
He's worried about your relationship.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.610
I told him I would talk to you.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.950
Okay. Let's talk.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.179
Rajan?

39:21.692 --> 39:24.570
[Rajan] You will stay the fuck away
from my family!

39:24.653 --> 39:25.738
Do you hear me?

39:26.322 --> 39:28.949
I owe you nothing! Nothing!

39:29.450 --> 39:30.993
You're not gonna do anything!

39:33.037 --> 39:36.707
You know what? This is over!
I told you, it's over! I'm done!

39:40.211 --> 39:41.629
Who were you talking to?

39:46.342 --> 39:49.095
No one. An old client in America.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.222
We just had a disagreement.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.349
It sounded serious.

39:54.975 --> 39:55.976
It's just late.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.898
-You should go back to bed, Kala.
-What about you?

40:00.981 --> 40:04.276
I'll... I've got some things to do.
I'll join you.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.311
Are you all right?

40:49.488 --> 40:51.449
I look terrible.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.870
I hate heels. I'm already klutzy enough.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.580
You look great.

40:57.663 --> 41:01.500
You're just feeling a little anxious
because Teagan asked you to do a toast.

41:02.251 --> 41:05.171
And the idea of talking
in front of your parents

41:05.254 --> 41:07.298
has you battening down the hatches.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.384
You're so right.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.930
See? There's something my cluster
would never be able to know

41:15.014 --> 41:15.973
about what was going on.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.142
Come here.

41:42.082 --> 41:42.958
Wolfgang.

41:43.542 --> 41:44.877
What did he want?

41:45.419 --> 41:47.922
He didn't say, but he doesn't talk much.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.785
Wolfgang.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.003
Hello.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.268
What's going on?

42:44.436 --> 42:45.688
I'll handle it.

43:19.513 --> 43:21.974
Riley... Wolfgang's in trouble.

43:22.057 --> 43:23.058
Nomi.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.227
What's wrong with Wolfgang?

43:25.311 --> 43:28.355
Wolfgang's meeting Lila
and we think the meeting is a trap.

44:12.524 --> 44:15.110
I knew this woman was trouble. I knew it!

44:15.194 --> 44:16.695
At least we know the name
of the restaurant.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.865
But this doesn't make any sense.
And why would he agree to this meeting?

44:19.948 --> 44:21.992
Maybe he felt he didn't have a choice.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.911
She wanted this fight.

44:23.994 --> 44:27.039
But if he knew it was a trap,
why wouldn't he ask us for help?

44:27.122 --> 44:28.415
Wolfgang?

44:29.041 --> 44:29.875
Ask for help?

44:32.503 --> 44:33.587
Can't picture it.

44:40.844 --> 44:42.012
Greco di Tufo.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.515
We come from the same place.

44:44.598 --> 44:45.808
Oh.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.269
Greco's been around for 2,000 years.

44:50.229 --> 44:52.231
It has outlived other grapes.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.568
The wine drunk
to toast the end of the world...

44:57.111 --> 44:58.612
this will also be Greco.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.409
I like beer.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.831
-Beer for the Berliner.
-[in Italian] Right away.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.423
-Would she really attack him in public?
-I would.

45:17.506 --> 45:20.342
Which means there could be several killers
in that room. We need to ID them.

45:21.176 --> 45:24.054
Shit. Okay. Amanita,
we need to get control over--

45:24.138 --> 45:25.222
[screams]

45:26.473 --> 45:28.517
I can see your hackles are up.

45:29.977 --> 45:33.147
You're sniffing the air,
trying to understand if I'm alone or...

45:33.439 --> 45:34.523
if this is a trap.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.191
Is it?

45:36.733 --> 45:38.318
Do you like this feeling?

45:39.528 --> 45:42.156
The tension of not knowing
who you can trust?

45:44.783 --> 45:45.909
I don't.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.245
I hate it.

45:50.205 --> 45:53.041
I hate being... controlled

45:53.125 --> 45:57.796
and forced to make deals and compromises
I don't want to make.

46:03.719 --> 46:06.722
What are we gonna do?
The killers could be anywhere.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.349
[Will] We need access
to the restaurant computer.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.851
[Sun] How without Nomi?

46:10.934 --> 46:12.769
[phone rings]

46:15.063 --> 46:16.857
-Yeah?
-Hello, Officer.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.359
I do believe you're in need of assistance.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.611
Who the hell are you?

46:20.694 --> 46:23.864
You can call me the Bug.

46:26.867 --> 46:30.037
Hi. I'm a friend of Will and Riley.
Are they there?

46:31.163 --> 46:32.664
-Yeah--
-Amanita.

46:33.248 --> 46:35.792
Riley. Wow.

46:36.710 --> 46:37.836
Is Nomi okay?

46:38.420 --> 46:39.421
She'll be fine.

46:39.963 --> 46:42.466
Lola says she's a bit concussed
but she'll sleep it off.

46:42.549 --> 46:44.384
She was more worried about you.

46:44.468 --> 46:47.262
We're okay. But we could use your help.

46:49.014 --> 46:51.266
In the neighborhood I'm from, we say,

46:51.350 --> 46:53.977
"All the government
is someone else's government."

46:55.020 --> 46:58.649
I want to build a rione...
a neighborhood for our kind.

46:59.024 --> 47:02.277
I want to use this city.
I want to take it and make it ours.

47:02.361 --> 47:04.863
There are many people
who try to own this city.

47:06.281 --> 47:07.574
They're not us.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.160
And what would "we" do with a city?

47:10.244 --> 47:14.456
We need a place where we can be free,
be ourselves. Free of sapiens.

47:16.166 --> 47:17.876
Sounds like a nice fantasy.

47:19.169 --> 47:20.754
Help me make it a reality.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.173
Are you giving me a choice?

47:26.009 --> 47:28.428
If it was about a choice,
would you have come?

47:33.433 --> 47:36.019
I've got encrypted emails
from Sebastian Fuchs

47:36.103 --> 47:38.897
referencing the restaurant
and Lila Facchini.

47:39.481 --> 47:41.316
I'll cross it
with the reservation records.

47:45.195 --> 47:46.947
[waiter speaking Italian]

47:48.031 --> 47:49.616
[speaking Italian]

47:52.703 --> 47:54.371
Hey! Whoa! How do you know that?

47:54.454 --> 47:56.164
If we can cross-check the names,
we can verify--

47:56.248 --> 47:58.875
-Hold on, hold on. Interpol?
-It's an emergency.

48:01.420 --> 48:05.507
Okay. It's happening again.
I don't believe this.

48:05.591 --> 48:07.884
I know you're a little old-fashioned,
Wolfgang.

48:08.885 --> 48:13.098
Some part of you thinks it should be
the man who proposes to the woman, but...

48:13.181 --> 48:18.895
from the first moment our eyes touched,
I could feel our fates were connected.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.359
I've got two out of three names
coming through.

48:24.985 --> 48:28.697
What about your cluster?
Do they buy into your little fantasy?

48:29.281 --> 48:30.490
Of course.

48:32.951 --> 48:35.954
We are mai soli. Never alone.

48:37.581 --> 48:41.126
Okay, three reservations made
two nights ago within ten minutes:

48:41.209 --> 48:43.545
tables five, 12 and 16.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.839
-We need to...
-...be sure.

48:47.007 --> 48:49.009
We can ping them through Fuchs' account.

48:50.427 --> 48:53.055
I think you might like us
when you get to know us.

48:53.847 --> 48:57.225
Maybe even that small
old-fashioned part of you.

49:05.108 --> 49:07.611
All he has is a single Glock.

49:14.701 --> 49:18.080
Maybe we should take this conversation
somewhere more private.

49:19.122 --> 49:20.582
I don't think so.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.459
[Bug] Here we go. Here we go.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.672
[phones ringing, beeping]

49:27.422 --> 49:30.801
[phones ringing, beeping]

49:32.302 --> 49:33.762
[gasping, laughing]

49:33.845 --> 49:35.347
Bug, you are a genius!

49:35.430 --> 49:37.849
Well, technically,
I tend to test in the high 130s,

49:37.933 --> 49:39.518
but really, who's counting?

49:39.601 --> 49:41.561
So, let's say I play along.

49:42.354 --> 49:44.898
Is this where you tell me
I have to take out Sebastian Fuchs?

49:46.525 --> 49:49.861
I promised you, no middle ground.

49:49.945 --> 49:52.739
How do I know you won't just sell me out
like everyone else?

49:53.448 --> 49:55.450
You're not like everyone else.

49:55.534 --> 49:56.702
Yeah.

49:58.245 --> 49:59.371
But you are.

50:00.247 --> 50:02.791
I told you this was a waste of our time.

50:05.794 --> 50:07.170
-Wolfgang.
-Mm-hmm?

50:08.588 --> 50:11.007
This city needs a true king.

50:11.633 --> 50:13.385
These people are desperate for a leader.

50:13.468 --> 50:16.012
I know they will go to their knees
for a man like you.

50:16.096 --> 50:18.306
[sighs] You don't understand.

50:21.309 --> 50:22.561
This is Berlin.

50:23.478 --> 50:25.188
These are my people.

50:25.731 --> 50:27.566
And we go to our knees for no one.

50:29.192 --> 50:32.696
Take your fucking "mai soli"
and the three guns Fuchs hired

50:32.779 --> 50:34.823
and fuck off.

50:36.950 --> 50:41.413
I'm going to enjoy scraping you
off my shoe like the dog shit you are.

50:50.547 --> 50:52.132
Bring it, bitch.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.599
[indistinct shouting]

51:03.101 --> 51:04.603
[diners screaming, shouting]

51:50.941 --> 51:51.983
[guns click]

52:01.201 --> 52:02.702
Oh, Wolfgang.

52:05.997 --> 52:07.958
We could've had everything.

52:08.875 --> 52:11.545
All I want right now is one more bullet.

52:17.968 --> 52:19.344
I make a promise to you.

52:20.262 --> 52:22.848
You will come to regret not dying tonight.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.009
-[siren wailing in distance]
-Help me.

52:59.718 --> 53:00.719
Help me!

53:00.802 --> 53:02.470
-Please!
-[loud bang]

53:02.554 --> 53:03.638
Help!

53:05.640 --> 53:09.686
Help me! Please! He just attacked me!

53:09.769 --> 53:11.146
He's over there! Please!

53:14.441 --> 53:16.401
He killed everybody!

53:16.985 --> 53:18.028
Please, help me!
