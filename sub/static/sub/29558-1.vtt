00:01.380 --> 00:03.969
[catchy music]

00:08.111 --> 00:10.700
[dogs barking]

00:21.849 --> 00:23.161
- Here we are, Mugs.

00:23.161 --> 00:26.819
Our first day of class
at Pooch University.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.235
- Oh, boy!

00:28.235 --> 00:30.754
I've waited my whole
life, all two years of it,

00:30.754 --> 00:32.445
to attend Pooch U.

00:32.445 --> 00:33.999
- Me too!

00:33.999 --> 00:35.242
And look at this place!

00:35.242 --> 00:37.899
It's everything I
thought it'd be.

00:37.899 --> 00:39.177
Let me tell ya.

00:39.177 --> 00:42.249
- [sniffs] Smell these
halls, the textbooks,

00:42.249 --> 00:45.252
the number two lead
pencils, the erasers!

00:45.252 --> 00:47.047
- Listen to those paws squeak

00:47.047 --> 00:49.359
on the freshly
mopped tile floors.

00:49.359 --> 00:51.913
Oh, I've dreamt of this!

00:51.913 --> 00:53.018
- So have I!

00:53.018 --> 00:55.089
Hey, let's find our classroom.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.159
I don't want us to be late

00:56.159 --> 00:57.505
to our very first lesson.

00:57.505 --> 00:58.610
- Neither do I!

00:58.610 --> 01:00.163
Let's go.

01:00.163 --> 01:02.338
Check this place out, Mugs!

01:02.338 --> 01:03.201
[chuckles]

01:03.201 --> 01:04.822
It's so big!

01:04.822 --> 01:07.860
So sprawling, it's vast!

01:08.999 --> 01:10.139
- I know!

01:10.139 --> 01:12.451
Imagine throwing a
bone down this hallway,

01:12.451 --> 01:13.866
then chasing after it.

01:13.866 --> 01:14.936
Oh, what fun!

01:14.936 --> 01:16.317
- Or a Frisbee!

01:16.317 --> 01:18.664
- Now, hold on a
second, buddy boy.

01:18.664 --> 01:20.632
This is the world
of scholastics,

01:20.632 --> 01:23.013
an institution of
higher learning.

01:23.013 --> 01:24.567
- Yeah, so?

01:25.464 --> 01:26.672
What's your point?

01:26.672 --> 01:29.123
- Well my point,
pup pupil, is this.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.712
We can't act like a
couple of animals here.

01:31.712 --> 01:34.508
We're not marauding
mutts, backyard brutes,

01:34.508 --> 01:36.130
canine commandos.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.925
We're students, and we're here

01:37.925 --> 01:39.168
to get an education.

01:39.168 --> 01:41.411
- Oh, yeah!

01:41.411 --> 01:42.654
I gotcha.

01:42.654 --> 01:44.656
No chasing our tails
or alerting when

01:44.656 --> 01:46.209
someone uses a pencil sharpener!

01:46.209 --> 01:48.108
- Or barking when
someone drops a book.

01:48.108 --> 01:48.936
- Oh!

01:50.006 --> 01:51.801
No barking?

01:51.801 --> 01:54.114
- Oh, no barking, Slobberstick.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.944
Zero, nada, zilch.

01:56.944 --> 01:58.394
Barking's a no go here.

01:58.394 --> 02:00.672
We bark, and we'll
be canine non grata

02:00.672 --> 02:02.018
for the rest of the semester,

02:02.018 --> 02:03.847
you mark my words.

02:03.847 --> 02:05.263
- Sheesh!

02:06.678 --> 02:11.165
Okay, but barking is my
favorite activity, Mugs.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.961
It's gonna be some kinda
tough to control myself.

02:13.961 --> 02:16.308
- Well you gotta, Slobberstick.

02:16.308 --> 02:19.415
We only get one chance to
make a first impression,

02:19.415 --> 02:22.487
and I want ours to be
the best it can be.

02:22.487 --> 02:26.007
Who knows, maybe someday
we'll be professors here.

02:26.007 --> 02:27.354
- Whoa!

02:27.354 --> 02:28.562
Really?

02:28.562 --> 02:30.046
You think?

02:30.046 --> 02:32.117
- If we play our biscuits
right, you never know.

02:32.117 --> 02:36.466
- That'd be
incredible! [chuckles]

02:36.466 --> 02:38.434
Professor Slobberstick.

02:38.434 --> 02:39.849
- Professor Mugs.

02:39.849 --> 02:41.816
[laughing]

02:41.816 --> 02:43.232
- The future's bright, Mugs.

02:43.232 --> 02:44.578
Let's buy some chains.

02:45.682 --> 02:47.546
- First things
first, Slobberstick,

02:47.546 --> 02:49.099
let's get to class.

02:49.099 --> 02:50.480
- Here we are!

02:50.480 --> 02:52.620
There's our room number.

02:52.620 --> 02:53.449
- Oh, boy!

02:53.449 --> 02:55.002
Here we go!

02:55.002 --> 02:58.074
[lighthearted music]

03:00.421 --> 03:01.595
Uh, hi.

03:01.595 --> 03:03.252
You must be Professor Fetch.

03:03.252 --> 03:05.875
- And you must be
Slobbersticks and Mugs.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.497
- Mugs and Slobberstick.

03:07.497 --> 03:08.464
Nice to meet you.

03:08.464 --> 03:10.051
- Yes, yes!

03:10.051 --> 03:12.606
Well, are you dogs ready
for your introduction

03:12.606 --> 03:14.159
to higher learning?

03:14.159 --> 03:15.505
- Are we?

03:15.505 --> 03:16.472
[laughing]

03:16.472 --> 03:18.612
We were born ready.

03:18.612 --> 03:20.234
- Well! [laughs]

03:20.234 --> 03:21.718
I like your attitude.

03:21.718 --> 03:23.617
Let's get ready to start class.

03:23.617 --> 03:25.688
- Oh, goody!

03:25.688 --> 03:27.207
Goody, let's go.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.691
Toss something, Professor.

03:28.691 --> 03:32.073
You got a rock, a wet
stick, an old shoe?

03:32.073 --> 03:36.561
- Hm, well this is not
that kind of class,

03:36.561 --> 03:38.321
this is higher dog learning.

03:38.321 --> 03:42.222
We must follow a certain
scholastic etiquette.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.568
- Etiquette?

03:43.568 --> 03:45.673
Is that a dessert?

03:45.673 --> 03:48.055
It's like a donut,
right? [laughs]

03:48.055 --> 03:49.470
Yum.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.023
I love donuts.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.335
- Slobberstick, please.

03:52.335 --> 03:53.750
You're embarrassing us.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.027
[laughing]

03:55.027 --> 03:56.512
- Quite the contrary, Mugs.

03:56.512 --> 03:59.549
You are inquisitive, curious.

03:59.549 --> 04:01.379
Etiquette is the customary code

04:01.379 --> 04:03.967
of polite behavior in society,

04:03.967 --> 04:07.212
or among members of a
particular profession or group.

04:07.212 --> 04:08.040
- Oh!

04:08.040 --> 04:09.179
Like dogs.

04:09.179 --> 04:11.147
- Yes, like dogs!

04:11.147 --> 04:13.736
Which, as it so happens,
will be the subject

04:13.736 --> 04:15.151
of our first class today.

04:15.151 --> 04:16.565
- Dogs?

04:16.565 --> 04:18.982
Woo hoo! [laughs]

04:18.982 --> 04:22.227
I know this subject
like the back of my paw.

04:22.227 --> 04:23.263
- Me too!

04:23.263 --> 04:24.402
This should be fun.

04:24.402 --> 04:26.990
- No doubt, pupils, no doubt.

04:26.990 --> 04:29.199
Since you boys
are rearing to go,

04:29.199 --> 04:30.649
let's say we begin at once.

04:30.649 --> 04:32.513
There's much ground to cover.

04:32.513 --> 04:33.859
- How sweet!

04:33.859 --> 04:34.688
- Awesome!

04:34.688 --> 04:36.724
- Let's see...

04:36.724 --> 04:39.520
Where to begin?

04:39.520 --> 04:42.489
Ah, how about with
one you'll know.

04:42.489 --> 04:44.145
If you don't mind
me asking, Mugs,

04:44.145 --> 04:46.078
what kind of breed
of dog are you?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.010
- Me?

04:47.010 --> 04:48.426
I'm a sheepdog, Professor.

04:48.426 --> 04:49.289
- Excellent!

04:49.289 --> 04:50.324
We'll start there.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.325
Have a seat.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.431
[bell rings]

04:53.431 --> 04:57.676
If you or your friends
ever need to be corralled,

04:57.676 --> 05:01.266
it's a good bet that
the Shetland Sheepdog

05:01.266 --> 05:03.303
can more than do the trick.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.339
In fact, herding is exactly

05:05.339 --> 05:08.377
what this cute little
animal was bred to do.

05:10.137 --> 05:12.381
Shetland Sheepdogs
are also known

05:12.381 --> 05:14.624
as the "Sheltie" for short.

05:14.624 --> 05:16.937
They're small dogs
that look a lot like

05:16.937 --> 05:19.871
tiny versions of the
very popular collie.

05:19.871 --> 05:22.494
The Sheltie is part
of a group of dogs

05:22.494 --> 05:24.531
called "herding dogs".

05:24.531 --> 05:27.465
The amazing Shetland
Sheepdog comes to the world

05:27.465 --> 05:28.776
from the Shetland Islands,

05:28.776 --> 05:30.399
where breeders created it

05:30.399 --> 05:33.988
by mixing Icelandic Yakkins
with Border Collies.

05:33.988 --> 05:37.233
These pooches were
primarily used to herd sheep

05:37.233 --> 05:41.099
so that they are kept
away from garden plants.

05:41.099 --> 05:42.307
How neat!

05:42.307 --> 05:44.482
Even though when
it comes to herding

05:44.482 --> 05:46.898
few dogs are as
good as the Sheltie,

05:46.898 --> 05:49.935
today these magnificent
mutts are mostly found

05:49.935 --> 05:53.042
herding kids around
in homes everywhere.

05:53.042 --> 05:56.735
Moms and dads are very
grateful for this. [chuckles]

05:56.735 --> 05:57.909
You can imagine.

05:59.531 --> 06:02.465
The Sheltie is super popular
in the United States,

06:02.465 --> 06:04.502
where it comes in at number 20

06:04.502 --> 06:07.125
on the most popular breeds list.

06:07.125 --> 06:10.404
Shelties can grow to be
about 15 inches tall,

06:10.404 --> 06:14.374
and weigh in anywhere
from 20 to 40 pounds.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.377
These cute little guys
have a thick double coat,

06:17.377 --> 06:20.276
and a hefty mane
around their necks.

06:20.276 --> 06:23.624
They come in lots of
colors like black and gray,

06:23.624 --> 06:26.834
but it's the tricolored
black, white, and tan ones

06:26.834 --> 06:28.940
that are most often seen,

06:28.940 --> 06:31.908
and wow do we love seeing them.

06:31.908 --> 06:34.877
They're just so
doggoned adorable!

06:34.877 --> 06:37.500
[lighthearted music]

06:37.500 --> 06:40.123
Shetland Sheepdogs have
heads that are shaped

06:40.123 --> 06:43.264
like a slice of pie,
almond shaped eyes,

06:43.264 --> 06:45.405
cute little ears
with folded tips,

06:45.405 --> 06:48.615
and muscular bodies
with long tails.

06:51.859 --> 06:54.724
Shelties are
incredibly smart too!

06:54.724 --> 06:56.761
In fact, they are the sixth most

06:56.761 --> 07:00.592
intelligent type of dog
in the whole wide world.

07:00.592 --> 07:01.559
- Wow!

07:01.559 --> 07:03.423
I didn't know all that.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.872
- Neither did I.

07:04.872 --> 07:07.012
You were a mystery to me, buddy.

07:07.012 --> 07:10.360
- Welcome to the world of
higher learning, pupils.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.674
Where no subject is exempt
from our probing minds,

07:13.674 --> 07:16.815
and no mental stone
will be left unturned.

07:16.815 --> 07:18.092
- Stones?

07:18.092 --> 07:21.751
I love turning over
stones, and sticks,

07:21.751 --> 07:25.548
and balls, tennis
balls especially!

07:25.548 --> 07:26.722
- Slobberstick, please.

07:26.722 --> 07:28.448
- Oh, right.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.552
[laughing]

07:29.552 --> 07:30.795
- Moving right along.

07:30.795 --> 07:31.589
- Yeah!

07:32.624 --> 07:34.212
Tell us more, Professor.

07:34.212 --> 07:35.903
- What about collies?

07:35.903 --> 07:38.078
Every wonder what
the smartest dog

07:38.078 --> 07:40.287
in the whole wide world is?

07:40.287 --> 07:42.254
Well, you're about to meet them.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.740
Get set to meet
the wondrous animal

07:44.740 --> 07:47.467
known as the Border Collie.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.261
[dramatic music]

07:49.261 --> 07:50.953
Border Collies are working dogs

07:50.953 --> 07:53.680
who are relatives
of landrace collies.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.578
These amazing
animals were created

07:55.578 --> 07:57.166
during the 19th century

07:57.166 --> 08:00.169
by breeders to chase
and keep farm animals

08:00.169 --> 08:01.653
like sheep together.

08:03.552 --> 08:05.830
Border Collies are world famous

08:05.830 --> 08:08.073
for their incredible
intelligence,

08:08.073 --> 08:10.282
and excellent herding skills.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.976
Nowadays, they make
super household pets too!

08:16.530 --> 08:18.946
Border Collies can
grow up to about

08:18.946 --> 08:21.570
18 to 22 inches tall,

08:21.570 --> 08:24.952
and weigh around
27 to 45 pounds.

08:24.952 --> 08:27.299
These dogs have smooth fur,

08:27.299 --> 08:30.337
and at times, it can
even feel a little rough.

08:30.337 --> 08:32.650
They're usually black
and white in color,

08:32.650 --> 08:35.238
but it has a
beautiful double coat

08:35.238 --> 08:37.413
that can be a mix of white, red,

08:37.413 --> 08:39.241
and light or dark brown.

08:39.241 --> 08:43.832
They are gorgeous,
simply gorgeous.

08:43.832 --> 08:46.456
Border Collies have
flat, medium sized heads

08:46.456 --> 08:48.528
with loving, oval shaped faces,

08:48.528 --> 08:51.013
and ears that can either
stand straight up,

08:51.013 --> 08:52.704
or be dropping.

08:52.704 --> 08:54.395
They have medium length hair

08:54.395 --> 08:57.813
that goes all the way to
the tips of their tails.

08:57.813 --> 09:00.540
How handsome is this dog?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.266
[dramatic music]

09:06.511 --> 09:07.995
Border Collies are
famous for being

09:07.995 --> 09:09.894
the smartest dog in the world,

09:09.894 --> 09:12.068
and the smartest
Bordie Collie ever

09:12.068 --> 09:13.760
was named Chaser.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.831
This amazing animal
learned the name

09:15.831 --> 09:19.628
of each of her 1,000 toys.

09:19.628 --> 09:21.630
Now that's smart!

09:21.630 --> 09:25.288
Another super smartypants
Border Collie was Striker.

09:25.288 --> 09:27.567
He learned how to
roll down car windows

09:27.567 --> 09:29.810
using his nose and paws.

09:29.810 --> 09:32.123
Maybe he even knew how to drive,

09:32.123 --> 09:35.471
and just didn't tell
anyone. [laughs]

09:36.990 --> 09:40.649
Border Collies are insanely
happy and loyal dogs

09:40.649 --> 09:43.065
who love to be
surrounded with people

09:43.065 --> 09:44.756
and other animals.

09:44.756 --> 09:47.517
[dramatic music]

09:48.898 --> 09:52.522
Hope you have a big backyard
if you own one of these.

09:52.522 --> 09:54.904
These dogs need lots of exercise

09:54.904 --> 09:56.665
to stay happy and healthy.

09:56.665 --> 10:01.324
A bored Border Collie may
drive you a little crazy.

10:01.324 --> 10:04.086
[dramatic music]

10:05.570 --> 10:08.124
Border Collies can learn to
do lots of important things

10:08.124 --> 10:10.195
like being search
and rescue dogs,

10:10.195 --> 10:12.232
and serving as therapy dogs

10:12.232 --> 10:14.924
for people who need
some extra attention.

10:14.924 --> 10:17.996
They really are
all-purpose pooches.

10:24.037 --> 10:25.901
- Rowdy, those collies!

10:25.901 --> 10:29.698
- A boxer is a very
interesting dog breed.

10:29.698 --> 10:31.113
Put 'em up, kids.

10:31.113 --> 10:34.634
You're about to meet
a dog like no other!

10:34.634 --> 10:37.119
Say hello to the boxer!

10:37.119 --> 10:39.328
Well, not a real boxer,

10:39.328 --> 10:41.848
though these dogs
would look super funny

10:41.848 --> 10:44.782
wearing boxing gloves. [laughs]

10:44.782 --> 10:47.129
The boxer was created
by dog breeders

10:47.129 --> 10:49.649
during the 19th
century in Germany.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.894
They were made by mixing
Mastiffs with English Bulldogs.

10:53.894 --> 10:56.656
The boxers were bred to
be good hunting dogs,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.588
but over the years
they've become

10:58.588 --> 11:01.522
really cool and
popular house pets.

11:01.522 --> 11:03.801
You might even know one.

11:03.801 --> 11:06.355
They're medium sized
dogs that grow to be

11:06.355 --> 11:09.116
about 21 to 25 inches tall,

11:09.116 --> 11:13.327
and weigh in from
around 55 to 75 pounds.

11:15.122 --> 11:17.124
These handsome animals
have short hair

11:17.124 --> 11:18.194
and smooth fur,

11:18.194 --> 11:20.162
and are usually multi-colored.

11:20.162 --> 11:22.716
Boxers have smallish
heads with big lips

11:22.716 --> 11:24.062
and floppy ears,

11:24.062 --> 11:26.340
their jaws are
usually square shaped,

11:26.340 --> 11:28.032
and their bottom jaws stick out

11:28.032 --> 11:30.620
farther than their
top ones. [laughs]

11:30.620 --> 11:31.449
How cute.

11:33.037 --> 11:36.316
So, how did this dog
get its feisty name?

11:36.316 --> 11:39.043
The name "boxer" refers
to one of the more

11:39.043 --> 11:42.184
interesting habits of
this particular pooch.

11:42.184 --> 11:45.394
A boxer will actually
stand on its back legs

11:45.394 --> 11:48.984
and use its front paws
to actually box a bit.

11:48.984 --> 11:50.502
[chuckles] Wow.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.711
That's too cool.

11:53.264 --> 11:56.336
Also cool, there's a
boxer named "Brandy"

11:56.336 --> 11:57.993
who holds the record for having

11:57.993 --> 11:59.960
the longest tongue ever

11:59.960 --> 12:02.273
in the Guinness Book
of World Records.

12:02.273 --> 12:03.274
How long?

12:03.274 --> 12:05.655
17 inches!

12:05.655 --> 12:06.864
[chuckles] Wow.

12:06.864 --> 12:09.729
A kiss from Brandy would
leave you soaking wet.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.006
Be prepared, though.

12:11.006 --> 12:13.008
No matter what the tongue size,

12:13.008 --> 12:17.288
all boxers have a habit
of drooling. [chuckles]

12:19.497 --> 12:20.325
Cute.

12:20.325 --> 12:23.225
Sloppy, but cute.

12:23.225 --> 12:25.089
[catchy music]

12:25.089 --> 12:28.023
Boxers are also super
fast for their size,

12:28.023 --> 12:30.370
and when running, can
reach speeds of up to

12:30.370 --> 12:32.717
30 miles per hour.

12:32.717 --> 12:34.201
Whoa!

12:34.201 --> 12:37.929
They're super athletic dogs,
and were usually circus stars.

12:37.929 --> 12:41.933
They were even used during
the World War as messengers.

12:41.933 --> 12:43.141
Amazing.

12:45.972 --> 12:49.492
- Boxers are so
unique, Professor.

12:49.492 --> 12:52.185
I want to play with
one. [chuckles]

12:52.185 --> 12:54.566
Who do you think would
win in a tug-of-war, guys?

12:54.566 --> 12:57.431
Me or a boxer?

12:57.431 --> 12:59.399
- You might stand
a better chance

12:59.399 --> 13:01.401
with the next dog breed, Slobs.

13:01.401 --> 13:02.678
On to those chihuahuas.

13:02.678 --> 13:04.162
- As you wish, Mugs.

13:04.162 --> 13:06.682
Here come the chihuahuas.

13:06.682 --> 13:08.166
Let's hope you're ready,

13:08.166 --> 13:12.136
because you're about to meet
something really special.

13:12.136 --> 13:16.071
One of the smallest dogs
in the whole wide world!

13:16.071 --> 13:19.039
Say hello to the chihuahua!

13:20.489 --> 13:24.079
The chihuahua is a member
of the toy breed dog family,

13:24.079 --> 13:26.184
and they make awesome
little friends,

13:26.184 --> 13:29.118
as they love being
companions, and of course,

13:29.118 --> 13:30.913
adore lying in your lap.

13:30.913 --> 13:33.640
They sure are small
enough to fit, huh?

13:35.815 --> 13:39.094
Chihuahua are relatives
of an ancient Mexican dog

13:39.094 --> 13:41.130
that was known as
the Techichi dog.

13:41.130 --> 13:43.236
These tiny barkers
lived in Mexico

13:43.236 --> 13:46.032
for about 1,400
years before making

13:46.032 --> 13:48.448
its cute little way
to the United States,

13:48.448 --> 13:51.520
and eventually, around
the entire world.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.523
These little critters
are super popular,

13:54.523 --> 13:56.905
or should I say, "pupular".

14:00.149 --> 14:02.117
Chihuahua only
grow to be no more

14:02.117 --> 14:03.670
than nine inches tall,

14:03.670 --> 14:06.569
weighing in around
four to seven pounds.

14:06.569 --> 14:08.882
Now that is so tiny.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.437
Want to know something cool?

14:12.437 --> 14:15.751
There was once a chihuahua
named "Miracle Milly"

14:15.751 --> 14:17.787
and she holds the world record

14:17.787 --> 14:20.618
for being the
smallest dog on Earth,

14:20.618 --> 14:23.517
being on 3.8 inches tall,

14:23.517 --> 14:26.072
and weighing just
a couple of pounds!

14:26.072 --> 14:28.177
That's half the
size of a banana!

14:28.177 --> 14:31.318
Aw, too cute.

14:31.318 --> 14:33.251
[catchy music]

14:33.251 --> 14:35.875
There are two kinds of
adorable chihuahuas.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.153
One has long hair
and a smooth coat,

14:38.153 --> 14:40.362
and the other is
usually a silky,

14:40.362 --> 14:43.813
or at times, wiry single,
or even double coat.

14:43.813 --> 14:46.023
They come in lots of colors too.

14:46.023 --> 14:49.889
Like red, black,
gold, brown, white,

14:49.889 --> 14:53.133
and even sometimes show
up as multicolored.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.618
No matter what your
favorite color is,

14:55.618 --> 14:57.620
there's probably a
chihuahua out there

14:57.620 --> 14:59.450
waiting to lick you on the face

14:59.450 --> 15:02.142
with a big old kiss.

15:02.142 --> 15:05.249
[catchy music]

15:05.249 --> 15:07.389
Chihuahuas have
little round heads,

15:07.389 --> 15:11.048
big bulging eyes, and ears
that stand straight up

15:11.048 --> 15:12.325
on their noggins.

15:12.325 --> 15:15.121
They're named after the
largest state in Mexico,

15:15.121 --> 15:16.570
and for a little while,

15:16.570 --> 15:20.402
it was also known as either
a Texas or Arizona dog

15:20.402 --> 15:22.369
because that's where
these little fellas

15:22.369 --> 15:24.751
had been found in
the United States,

15:24.751 --> 15:27.167
just near the Mexico border.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.448
- What cool dogs chihuahuas are!

15:32.448 --> 15:34.105
I can't think of
another small breed

15:34.105 --> 15:35.935
that has more
charm than they do!

15:35.935 --> 15:38.938
- Well, Mugs, are you
familiar with the Pomeranian?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.249
- The Pomeranian?

15:40.249 --> 15:41.492
No.

15:41.492 --> 15:43.735
- Then allow me
to introduce you.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.014
Looking for the
perfect companion

15:46.014 --> 15:48.499
to have fun and cuddle with?

15:48.499 --> 15:49.741
Who isn't!

15:49.741 --> 15:51.571
Needless to say,
you're gonna fall

15:51.571 --> 15:54.539
quickly in love with
our next furry friend,

15:54.539 --> 15:55.920
the Pomeranian.

15:58.302 --> 16:00.718
Pomeranians are the
smallest members

16:00.718 --> 16:02.478
of the Spitz family of dogs,

16:02.478 --> 16:04.756
and even though they are small,

16:04.756 --> 16:07.794
they have giant
sized personalities.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.109
They're also a very
popular dog breed.

16:12.109 --> 16:15.181
Pomeranians are one
of the 15 most popular

16:15.181 --> 16:16.699
in the United States,

16:16.699 --> 16:20.807
and have stayed on that
list for over a decade.

16:20.807 --> 16:22.774
Wow, how cool!

16:23.983 --> 16:27.193
Pomeranians are adorable.

16:27.193 --> 16:30.506
They can grow to be about
seven or 12 inches tall,

16:30.506 --> 16:34.234
and weigh in somewhere between
three and seven pounds.

16:34.234 --> 16:36.616
These pooches have
thick, fluffy coats,

16:36.616 --> 16:38.618
and come in a ton of colors,

16:38.618 --> 16:43.002
like sable, red,
blue, gray, orange,

16:43.002 --> 16:46.039
brindle, and even bicolored tan,

16:46.039 --> 16:47.972
white, brown, and balck.

16:47.972 --> 16:49.180
How cool!

16:50.250 --> 16:52.114
Pomeranians have
pie shaped heads

16:52.114 --> 16:54.358
with pointy snouts
which makes them look

16:54.358 --> 16:56.705
kind of like tiny foxes.

16:56.705 --> 16:59.052
They also have
almond shaped eyes,

16:59.052 --> 17:03.401
pointy ears, and small
bodies with curly tails.

17:03.401 --> 17:05.472
Aren't they cute?

17:05.472 --> 17:08.579
[lighthearted music]

17:10.098 --> 17:13.031
These adorable doggies
are uber intelligent,

17:13.031 --> 17:16.345
very loyal, and even
kind of independent.

17:16.345 --> 17:18.347
They aren't very
demanding animals,

17:18.347 --> 17:20.798
but they will bond
with their family

17:20.798 --> 17:23.007
and follow them
from room to room

17:23.007 --> 17:24.733
to make sure they're near,

17:24.733 --> 17:27.666
should they want to
give their pooch a rub.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.083
Aw!

17:30.083 --> 17:32.775
Pomeranians also
love to be dressed up

17:32.775 --> 17:35.019
and travel with their families,

17:35.019 --> 17:38.195
either on foot, or
in a doggy stroller.

17:38.195 --> 17:39.886
Isn't that sweet?

17:39.886 --> 17:41.957
Plus, because they're so smart

17:41.957 --> 17:43.717
and can learn tricks easily,

17:43.717 --> 17:46.099
they're extra fun, fun, fun!

17:47.549 --> 17:52.036
- Nice, but what about some
big dog breeds, Professor?

17:53.210 --> 17:56.420
These teeny, tiny dogs
are like wind up toys.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.698
Can we hear about
something we can relate to?

17:58.698 --> 18:01.390
- Oh, you want the big dogs, eh?

18:01.390 --> 18:02.495
- Yeah!

18:02.495 --> 18:03.875
- Okay, Slobberstick.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.292
Try the Mastiff on for size!

18:06.292 --> 18:07.396
- The Mastiff?

18:08.639 --> 18:09.950
Cool!

18:09.950 --> 18:12.470
- Say hello to this big dog.

18:12.470 --> 18:15.301
The English Mastiff
is a very large

18:15.301 --> 18:17.303
and awesome worker animal.

18:17.303 --> 18:20.582
Let's check out
everything about them.

18:20.582 --> 18:23.032
English Mastiffs were
created in England

18:23.032 --> 18:25.621
by breeders from a
now extinct dog breed

18:25.621 --> 18:28.279
that was once known as Molossus.

18:29.418 --> 18:31.627
The English Mastiff
came to America

18:31.627 --> 18:34.182
on the Mayflower
with the pilgrims!

18:34.182 --> 18:36.977
Can you say colonial dog?

18:36.977 --> 18:40.049
[lighthearted music]

18:43.018 --> 18:45.986
These pooches are
the 26th most popular

18:45.986 --> 18:47.954
dog breed in the United States,

18:47.954 --> 18:50.474
and are great and
gentle house pets.

18:50.474 --> 18:53.132
But the English Mastiff is big.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.756
Fully grown, they can
be 27 to 30 inches tall,

18:56.756 --> 19:01.692
and weigh anywhere
from 140 to 220 pounds.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.004
My, my!

19:04.004 --> 19:07.180
[lighthearted music]

19:07.180 --> 19:10.010
These marvelous animals
have short, sleek coats

19:10.010 --> 19:13.738
that come in light yellowish
brown, light reddish brown,

19:13.738 --> 19:17.190
or sometimes yellowish
brown with black spots!

19:17.190 --> 19:20.642
Breeders call this
color combo "brindle".

19:20.642 --> 19:23.714
[lighthearted music]

19:27.304 --> 19:31.411
An English Mastiff has a
really big head and body,

19:31.411 --> 19:34.932
and you guessed
it, they eat a lot.

19:34.932 --> 19:37.314
If you have a Mastiff
living in your home,

19:37.314 --> 19:39.626
you'll likely be
going grocery shopping

19:39.626 --> 19:42.629
for you and the
Mastiff quite a lot.

19:44.493 --> 19:45.977
For as big as they are,

19:45.977 --> 19:49.809
English Mastiffs are calm
and very gentle dogs.

19:49.809 --> 19:53.157
They're super loyal, and
get along with everyone,

19:53.157 --> 19:54.848
even other pets.

19:54.848 --> 19:56.022
Be warned, though.

19:56.022 --> 19:58.852
They are very
difficult to train.

19:58.852 --> 20:01.683
They're overly sensitive
and stubborn doggies,

20:01.683 --> 20:03.685
but they learn well from love

20:03.685 --> 20:06.308
and positive reinforcement.

20:06.308 --> 20:09.380
[lighthearted music]

20:14.454 --> 20:16.111
English Mastiffs can be kept

20:16.111 --> 20:18.044
in small houses and apartments

20:18.044 --> 20:21.220
because even if you
have a huge backyard,

20:21.220 --> 20:23.429
this big fella would
rather hang out

20:23.429 --> 20:25.224
inside with its family.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.502
Aw, too cute!

20:30.436 --> 20:31.954
- Wow!

20:31.954 --> 20:34.094
What a big guy.

20:34.094 --> 20:36.131
Now that's a dog.

20:36.131 --> 20:37.374
- Sure is!

20:37.374 --> 20:39.307
- I thought you boys
would enjoy that.

20:39.307 --> 20:40.929
And before we continue,

20:40.929 --> 20:42.965
no discussion of
large dog breeds

20:42.965 --> 20:44.691
would be complete
without touching

20:44.691 --> 20:46.141
on the German Shepherd.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.557
Guess what?

20:48.557 --> 20:51.284
You're about to meet
one of the best dogs

20:51.284 --> 20:53.907
in the whole wide world!

20:53.907 --> 20:56.979
Not to mention, one of
the most beautiful too.

20:56.979 --> 20:59.430
Say hello to the
German Shepherd,

20:59.430 --> 21:02.191
and prepare for lots of kisses.

21:04.090 --> 21:07.266
Originally known as the
German Shepherd Dog,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.371
this breed is one
of the only ones

21:09.371 --> 21:12.650
to have the word "Dog"
be apart of its name.

21:12.650 --> 21:13.617
Why?

21:13.617 --> 21:14.928
Well, that's a great question

21:14.928 --> 21:17.517
that has a pretty cool answer.

21:17.517 --> 21:20.624
Back in the olden days,
being a German Shepherd

21:20.624 --> 21:23.489
was a job that
lots of humans had.

21:23.489 --> 21:25.456
That's why the
breed became known

21:25.456 --> 21:27.527
as the German Shepherd Dog

21:27.527 --> 21:29.253
so people could
tell the difference

21:29.253 --> 21:33.119
when speaking about either
the person or the dog breed.

21:33.119 --> 21:34.776
Pretty cool, right?

21:34.776 --> 21:35.708
You betcha.

21:39.194 --> 21:43.992
During the year 1889, a man
named Max von Stephanitz

21:43.992 --> 21:46.270
started breeding
what we now know

21:46.270 --> 21:47.754
as the German Shepherd.

21:47.754 --> 21:51.171
This happened at a dog
show when he caught sight

21:51.171 --> 21:54.692
of a medium sized, gray
and yellow type dog

21:54.692 --> 21:56.970
that he thought
looked like a wolf.

21:56.970 --> 22:00.526
Developing this breed earned
Stephanitz the nickname,

22:00.526 --> 22:04.323
"Father of the
German Shepherd Dog".

22:04.323 --> 22:06.911
German Shepherd dogs
come in many colors

22:06.911 --> 22:10.915
like black, sable,
gray, black and tan,

22:10.915 --> 22:13.953
red and black, brown,
black and silver,

22:13.953 --> 22:16.127
and even blue.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.060
How cool is that?

22:18.060 --> 22:19.821
Over the years, German Shepherds

22:19.821 --> 22:23.031
have grown in popularity
all over the world,

22:23.031 --> 22:26.068
and it's become the
second most registered dog

22:26.068 --> 22:28.726
in the United States of America.

22:28.726 --> 22:31.453
[dramatic music]

22:42.188 --> 22:44.190
When it comes to a performance,

22:44.190 --> 22:47.780
there's not a whole lot that
a German Shepherd can't do.

22:47.780 --> 22:50.955
They make great house
pets, awesome guard dogs,

22:50.955 --> 22:54.373
serve on the force of both
the police and the military,

22:54.373 --> 22:58.307
and even make incredible
service and companion dogs.

22:58.307 --> 23:02.001
In a word, German
Shepherds are awesome!

23:03.140 --> 23:06.108
[dramatic music]

23:06.108 --> 23:09.940
- Amazing dogs, those
German Shepherds!

23:09.940 --> 23:11.493
- On to the Rottweiler!

23:11.493 --> 23:12.736
Give us a Rottie, Professor.

23:12.736 --> 23:14.945
- One Rottweiler coming up!

23:14.945 --> 23:17.534
It's time to meet not
only one of the best

23:17.534 --> 23:19.087
watch dogs in the world,

23:19.087 --> 23:22.193
but also one of
the most adorable!

23:22.193 --> 23:25.404
Get ready to say hi to
the German bred pooch,

23:25.404 --> 23:28.027
better known as the Rottweiler!

23:29.787 --> 23:32.825
Rottweilers were created
with protection in mind.

23:32.825 --> 23:35.137
In the olden days,
they were work dogs

23:35.137 --> 23:37.968
who were employed to guide
cattle to the market,

23:37.968 --> 23:41.799
and to pull heavy carts for
both butchers and farmers.

23:41.799 --> 23:45.803
These dogs are strong,
with a capital S.

23:46.735 --> 23:49.358
[catchy music]

23:51.637 --> 23:54.950
Rottweilers are the 10th
most popular breed of dog

23:54.950 --> 23:56.158
in the Untied States,

23:56.158 --> 23:58.195
and make super great house pets,

23:58.195 --> 24:00.646
and of course, guard dogs.

24:00.646 --> 24:03.856
[catchy music]

24:03.856 --> 24:05.444
Rotties are fairly big too.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.723
An adult can grow to be
almost 30 inches tall

24:08.723 --> 24:12.278
and weigh up to 130 pounds!

24:12.278 --> 24:13.486
Phew!

24:13.486 --> 24:15.868
Told you they were
big and strong.

24:15.868 --> 24:18.457
[catchy music]

24:20.804 --> 24:23.462
Rotties have really
smooth, short black coats,

24:23.462 --> 24:25.360
sometimes with brown markings

24:25.360 --> 24:26.948
on their adorable faces,

24:26.948 --> 24:29.847
and their super muscular
chests and legs.

24:29.847 --> 24:32.263
Their heads are
thick and sizable,

24:32.263 --> 24:35.197
with cute little triangle
shaped ears on top.

24:35.197 --> 24:37.165
Some owners like to shorten

24:37.165 --> 24:39.512
or crop their tails
when they're young,

24:39.512 --> 24:41.410
but we'll take these
black beauties.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.102
any way we can get them.

24:43.102 --> 24:45.794
Aw, how cute.

24:45.794 --> 24:48.383
[catchy music]

24:52.111 --> 24:54.907
Rottweilers are insanely smart,

24:54.907 --> 24:56.840
but along with that,

24:56.840 --> 24:59.498
they are super stubborn dogs.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.052
It can be easily
trained as long as

25:02.052 --> 25:04.744
their humans are fair and firm.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.474
Rotties are sometimes
related to being bullies,

25:10.474 --> 25:13.166
but that couldn't be
further from the truth.

25:13.166 --> 25:15.479
These dogs are very cuddly,

25:15.479 --> 25:17.412
and happy to please their humans

25:17.412 --> 25:19.552
by being very loyal.

25:19.552 --> 25:23.211
They really do make
awesome, loving pets.

25:23.211 --> 25:25.696
Rottweilers do not
like to be alone.

25:25.696 --> 25:27.974
They are social dogs
that want to spend

25:27.974 --> 25:30.736
as much time with their
families as possible.

25:32.910 --> 25:33.808
- Hey!

25:34.981 --> 25:37.881
Do you guys want to
hear about Dobermanns?

25:37.881 --> 25:40.780
- I'm sure everybody would
love to, Slobberstick.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.334
Check this out!

25:43.334 --> 25:46.199
One of the more famous
work dogs in the world

25:46.199 --> 25:49.927
is without question, the
renowned Dobermann Pinscher,

25:49.927 --> 25:52.309
and there's a great
reason for that.

25:52.309 --> 25:54.483
When it comes to
getting a job done,

25:54.483 --> 25:57.003
few pooches are
as capable, smart,

25:57.003 --> 26:00.248
and strong as this
handsome dog from Germany.

26:01.421 --> 26:03.769
The marvel known as
the Dobermann Pinscher

26:03.769 --> 26:06.219
was originally
created in Germany

26:06.219 --> 26:08.877
way back during the 1890s.

26:08.877 --> 26:11.121
Breeders did so by
combining around

26:11.121 --> 26:13.572
seven different breeds of dogs,

26:13.572 --> 26:16.713
including Rottweilers,
Manchester Terriers,

26:16.713 --> 26:20.579
the German Pinscher,
and even the Great Dane.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.821
Whoa!

26:21.821 --> 26:23.754
Why go through all
of this trouble?

26:23.754 --> 26:25.929
Because the breeders
wanted to create

26:25.929 --> 26:28.621
one of the world's
best guard dogs,

26:28.621 --> 26:31.279
and they were
totally successful.

26:31.279 --> 26:34.109
These incredible animals
came to the United States

26:34.109 --> 26:37.009
somewhere around the
beginning of the 20th century,

26:37.009 --> 26:39.908
and since then, they
have become the 12th most

26:39.908 --> 26:42.117
popular dog in America,

26:42.117 --> 26:44.119
and it's easy to tell why.

26:44.119 --> 26:46.915
Not only are they
incredible watch dogs,

26:46.915 --> 26:50.056
but they are amazing house pets.

26:50.056 --> 26:52.611
[catchy music]

26:55.027 --> 26:56.753
Dobermanns can
grow to be anywhere

26:56.753 --> 26:59.618
from 24 to 28 inches tall,

26:59.618 --> 27:03.898
and weigh between
60 to 100 pounds.

27:03.898 --> 27:06.176
Now that's a big dog.

27:06.176 --> 27:08.730
[catchy music]

27:09.835 --> 27:12.285
These good lookers
have a thin, short coat

27:12.285 --> 27:15.012
that ranges in color
from black, to red,

27:15.012 --> 27:17.636
and even blue or
yellowish brown.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.879
They all have rusty
colored markings

27:19.879 --> 27:21.640
above their cute little eyes,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.365
on their necks, and of course

27:23.365 --> 27:25.022
on their strong chests.

27:25.022 --> 27:27.404
Sometimes though,
you can even find

27:27.404 --> 27:30.027
a completely white Dobie.

27:30.027 --> 27:32.996
It's rare, but it does happen.

27:32.996 --> 27:35.619
[catchy music]

27:35.619 --> 27:38.449
Dobermann Pinschers
have long snouts,

27:38.449 --> 27:41.660
medium sized ears, and
super muscular bodies

27:41.660 --> 27:46.043
that end on a mighty long
and usually wagging tail.

27:46.043 --> 27:50.185
Look at their little
backsides wriggle, so cute.

27:50.185 --> 27:52.809
[catchy music]

27:52.809 --> 27:54.673
How's that for a fascinating

27:54.673 --> 27:57.330
and sometimes
frightening large breed?

27:57.330 --> 27:59.194
- That's so cool, Professor.

27:59.194 --> 28:01.024
Do any Dobermanns
take classes here?

28:01.024 --> 28:02.681
- We used to have
a couple, Mugs,

28:02.681 --> 28:03.958
but they couldn't get along

28:03.958 --> 28:05.476
with our Great Dane students.

28:05.476 --> 28:06.305
- Great Danes?

28:07.927 --> 28:09.377
Tell us more!

28:09.377 --> 28:11.966
- Don't worry, I will.

28:11.966 --> 28:15.348
Ready to meet one of the
greatest dogs in the world?

28:15.348 --> 28:16.764
One that's so great,

28:16.764 --> 28:20.077
it even has the word
great in its name?

28:20.077 --> 28:22.804
Say hello to the Great Dane!

28:22.804 --> 28:25.704
These dogs are as
big as they come.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.533
Great Danes are large animals

28:27.533 --> 28:32.055
that belong to a group of
dogs known as working dogs.

28:32.055 --> 28:35.092
Even though they have the
word Dane in their names,

28:35.092 --> 28:37.819
these dogs are not from Denmark.

28:37.819 --> 28:40.546
Great Danes came to
the world from Germany.

28:40.546 --> 28:42.513
They were created
by dog breeders

28:42.513 --> 28:44.895
over 400 years ago

28:44.895 --> 28:48.381
when they mixed old English
Mastiffs with Greyhounds

28:48.381 --> 28:51.074
and Mighty Irish Wolfhounds.

28:51.074 --> 28:54.560
The result is a
wonderfully fast, smart,

28:54.560 --> 28:56.873
and aggressive dog
that were perfect

28:56.873 --> 29:00.946
for hunting animals
including wild boars.

29:00.946 --> 29:02.568
Whoa.

29:02.568 --> 29:05.226
[intense music]

29:06.434 --> 29:08.850
Over the years since
their creation,

29:08.850 --> 29:11.819
Great Danes have become
far less aggressive,

29:11.819 --> 29:14.649
because they aren't used
for hunting anymore.

29:14.649 --> 29:17.169
Instead, they
prefer to play with

29:17.169 --> 29:18.929
and protect their family.

29:20.897 --> 29:22.899
Great Danes are
awesome house pets,

29:22.899 --> 29:25.764
and are often shown
off in dog shows.

29:27.489 --> 29:30.009
These dogs are big.

29:30.009 --> 29:33.047
Great Danes can grow up
to nearly three feet tall

29:33.047 --> 29:38.052
and weigh anywhere from 100
to well over 120 pounds.

29:38.673 --> 29:39.501
Wanna talk big?

29:39.501 --> 29:40.951
Check this out.

29:40.951 --> 29:43.436
There was once a
Great Dane named Zeus

29:43.436 --> 29:45.197
who became famous for being

29:45.197 --> 29:47.924
the world's tallest dog.

29:47.924 --> 29:49.166
That's right.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.755
Zeus is in the Guinness
Book of World Records

29:51.755 --> 29:55.241
for growing to a height of
three feet, eight inches tall,

29:55.241 --> 29:58.797
and weighing 150 pounds!

29:58.797 --> 30:00.799
Now that's a big dog.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.148
Great Danes have
short coats of hair

30:05.148 --> 30:07.322
that come in three
different kinds.

30:07.322 --> 30:10.912
Black, black and blue,
fawn, and harlequin.

30:10.912 --> 30:12.465
No matter what their color,

30:12.465 --> 30:14.674
they're all incredibly
pretty animals,

30:14.674 --> 30:17.332
and are a sight to remember
once you've seen them.

30:19.990 --> 30:22.165
These big pooches
have giant heads

30:22.165 --> 30:23.822
that are long and narrow,

30:23.822 --> 30:25.306
and sitting on top of them

30:25.306 --> 30:27.826
are cute little floppy ears.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.034
Their bodies?

30:29.034 --> 30:32.761
Well, they are as
muscular as they come.

30:32.761 --> 30:34.142
Even though they're large,

30:34.142 --> 30:38.181
Great Dane are also
big, emotional softies.

30:38.181 --> 30:40.873
They're loving and
calm and get along well

30:40.873 --> 30:43.600
with other dogs, and even cats.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.292
Great Danes just want
to love their families,

30:46.292 --> 30:48.881
and they hate to be left alone.

30:48.881 --> 30:49.709
Aw.

30:52.402 --> 30:55.370
Surprisingly, Great
Danes don't eat much,

30:55.370 --> 30:57.717
and don't need much exercise.

30:57.717 --> 30:59.961
Just walk them as
you usually would,

30:59.961 --> 31:02.688
and they'll remain
happy and healthy.

31:02.688 --> 31:04.828
How do you guys
love the Great Dane?

31:04.828 --> 31:06.830
- They're amazing, Professor.

31:06.830 --> 31:10.213
I have a Great Dane cousin
somewhere in the Midwest.

31:10.213 --> 31:11.421
- Oh, yeah!

31:11.421 --> 31:13.112
Cousin Marlon?

31:13.112 --> 31:14.838
I remember him.

31:14.838 --> 31:16.426
- Hey, what's next, Professor?

31:16.426 --> 31:18.877
- How about that
super cool terrier?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.224
- Yes, let's hear it!

31:21.224 --> 31:25.228
- The adorable Boston
Terrier is a lot of things.

31:25.228 --> 31:29.301
They're cute, funny,
playful, absolutely loyal,

31:29.301 --> 31:32.028
and no matter what
its name says,

31:32.028 --> 31:33.822
it isn't a terrier.

31:33.822 --> 31:37.240
Let's find out more
about this fuzzy friend.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.656
[lighthearted music]

31:39.656 --> 31:42.038
Boston Terriers were
created when breeders

31:42.038 --> 31:45.386
mixed the English Bulldog
and the now extinct

31:45.386 --> 31:46.905
White English Terrier.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.114
Since its introduction
to the world,

31:49.114 --> 31:52.634
this beauty has become the
state dog of Massachusetts,

31:52.634 --> 31:55.879
the official mascot
of Boston University,

31:55.879 --> 31:59.296
and of course, one of the
most popular dog breeds

31:59.296 --> 32:01.505
in the United States of America.

32:01.505 --> 32:02.472
How about that?

32:04.060 --> 32:06.303
Boston Terriers can
grow up to about

32:06.303 --> 32:08.512
12 to 17 inches tall,

32:08.512 --> 32:12.033
and weigh anywhere
from 10 to 25 pounds.

32:12.033 --> 32:14.001
They have smooth, shiny coats

32:14.001 --> 32:16.555
that come in lots
of colors like red,

32:16.555 --> 32:18.833
black, or even brindle.

32:18.833 --> 32:20.490
No matter what the color though,

32:20.490 --> 32:22.250
they all have white markings

32:22.250 --> 32:23.838
on their face and chest.

32:23.838 --> 32:25.115
So cute.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.223
These furry pals
are also known as

32:29.223 --> 32:30.914
the American Gentleman,

32:30.914 --> 32:32.812
because their overall markings

32:32.812 --> 32:36.609
make them look like they're
wearing a fancy tuxedo.

32:36.609 --> 32:37.438
[chuckling]

32:37.438 --> 32:39.612
So refined.

32:39.612 --> 32:42.788
[calming piano music]

32:45.170 --> 32:47.966
Boston Terriers have
box shaped heads,

32:47.966 --> 32:50.969
short snouts, large, erect ears,

32:50.969 --> 32:53.972
broad chests, sturdy
muscular bodies,

32:53.972 --> 32:55.974
and very short tails.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.873
Know what really makes
them stand out though?

32:58.873 --> 33:02.325
Their huge, loving, round eyes.

33:02.325 --> 33:03.809
Aw.

33:03.809 --> 33:06.985
[calming piano music]

33:08.296 --> 33:10.850
Boston Terriers are
very loving and gentle

33:10.850 --> 33:13.888
with extremely fun
loving personalities.

33:13.888 --> 33:15.234
They're smart, too.

33:15.234 --> 33:17.098
Super smart, in fact.

33:17.098 --> 33:19.963
But they're also
stubborn at times,

33:19.963 --> 33:21.896
nearly hyperactive even.

33:21.896 --> 33:25.313
It takes a long while to
properly train these cuties,

33:25.313 --> 33:26.728
but once they are,

33:26.728 --> 33:29.697
they're one of the
best dogs around.

33:29.697 --> 33:32.803
[calming piano music]

33:32.803 --> 33:35.979
Boston Terriers are
real athletes too!

33:35.979 --> 33:38.050
They're agile and can jump high,

33:38.050 --> 33:41.536
and even pull weights
in doggy competitions.

33:41.536 --> 33:42.779
See?

33:42.779 --> 33:45.023
I told you they were
strong as can be.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.648
Boston Terriers get
along great with kids

33:49.648 --> 33:50.821
and other animals,

33:50.821 --> 33:52.616
and have been
known to even learn

33:52.616 --> 33:55.171
how to ride skateboards.

33:55.171 --> 33:57.104
That's radical!

33:57.104 --> 33:59.175
When the day's
activities are over,

33:59.175 --> 34:02.109
Boston Terriers like to
chill out with their owners,

34:02.109 --> 34:04.939
and maybe even
cuddle up on a couch.

34:05.974 --> 34:07.183
- So cool!

34:07.183 --> 34:08.873
What's the next dog
breed, Professor?

34:08.873 --> 34:10.909
- The amazing beagle!

34:10.909 --> 34:12.947
Got any beagle cousin, anybody?

34:12.947 --> 34:14.190
- Me!

34:14.190 --> 34:17.364
Oh, I have a cousin
in about any breed,

34:17.364 --> 34:18.884
color, and size!

34:19.850 --> 34:22.370
- I'm willing to venture to say

34:22.370 --> 34:26.443
that one of your favorite
cartoon characters is Snoopy!

34:26.443 --> 34:28.100
Everyone loves him.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.964
Ever wonder what kind of animal

34:29.964 --> 34:31.310
this fellow is?

34:31.310 --> 34:33.449
Well, Snoopy is a beagle,

34:33.449 --> 34:36.418
and they've been around
for thousands of years.

34:38.110 --> 34:42.527
The beagle was created
over 2,500 years ago.

34:42.527 --> 34:44.047
Holy moly.

34:45.945 --> 34:48.844
This ancient dog breed
came to the United States

34:48.844 --> 34:51.882
from the country of England
during the 19th century.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.714
These beauties were
bred to be great hunters

34:55.714 --> 35:00.443
of rabbits, hares, foxes,
and even birds and fish.

35:00.443 --> 35:01.961
Wow!

35:01.961 --> 35:05.172
In fact, the beagle is still
very popular with hunters,

35:05.172 --> 35:07.070
and they're still used as good

35:07.070 --> 35:09.107
and dependable hunting dogs.

35:10.660 --> 35:14.042
Beagles have super
friendly personalities too.

35:14.042 --> 35:16.528
They're medium-sized
animals that can grow

35:16.528 --> 35:19.462
anywhere from 13
to 16 inches tall,

35:19.462 --> 35:21.947
and a full grown beagle
will weigh around

35:21.947 --> 35:24.467
20 to 25 pounds.

35:25.985 --> 35:28.298
Everyone agrees on one thing.

35:28.298 --> 35:30.507
Beagles are awesome.

35:30.507 --> 35:33.614
In fact, they just happen
to be the fifth most

35:33.614 --> 35:36.651
popular dog breed in
the United States.

35:36.651 --> 35:38.032
How cool is that?

35:40.759 --> 35:43.451
You can spot a
beagle super easily.

35:43.451 --> 35:45.315
They have really smooth coats

35:45.315 --> 35:48.318
that range from white,
to black, to brown,

35:48.318 --> 35:49.975
and a mixture thereof.

35:49.975 --> 35:52.219
They have cute,
little round skulls

35:52.219 --> 35:54.945
and long, super floppy ears.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.431
Their bodies are long,
and pretty muscular

35:57.431 --> 35:59.122
for a dog of its size,

35:59.122 --> 36:02.194
and they have the sweetest
little curly tails.

36:02.194 --> 36:06.474
And don't be surprised to
see them wagging like crazy.

36:06.474 --> 36:09.305
They're so easy to
fall in love with.

36:11.790 --> 36:15.759
Like Snoopy, beagles are
super smart and curious.

36:15.759 --> 36:18.210
They're very friendly
dogs who love

36:18.210 --> 36:20.557
going on adventures
with their owners.

36:20.557 --> 36:24.527
Also like Snoopy, beagles are
comically stubborn animals

36:24.527 --> 36:28.186
who are anything
but easy to train.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.774
[catchy music]

36:32.155 --> 36:35.331
Still in all, they are
very loyal to their owners,

36:35.331 --> 36:37.333
and that's part of
why they've become

36:37.333 --> 36:39.783
so very popular.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.338
[catchy music]

36:46.549 --> 36:49.207
Beagles do have a
tendency to get lonely,

36:49.207 --> 36:50.656
as they're a pack animal,

36:50.656 --> 36:52.865
and they hate being left alone.

36:52.865 --> 36:55.005
They actually like
having other dogs

36:55.005 --> 36:56.731
to pal around with too.

36:56.731 --> 36:59.217
There's always time
to play and get into

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
a little mischief, right?

37:02.081 --> 37:04.118
- Nice! [laughs]

37:05.982 --> 37:07.984
What are we tackling next?

37:07.984 --> 37:10.055
- Now I'm going to
tell you all about

37:10.055 --> 37:12.264
the dogs known as Basset Hounds.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.714
- Basset Hounds?

37:13.714 --> 37:14.784
Cool!

37:14.784 --> 37:16.234
- Indeed, Mugs.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.339
Let's begin!

37:18.339 --> 37:20.928
Hope you have your
traveling shoes on,

37:20.928 --> 37:24.518
we're gonna have to travel
all the way to France

37:24.518 --> 37:26.968
to meet our next furry friend!

37:26.968 --> 37:28.384
The Basset Hound!

37:29.730 --> 37:31.835
Basset Hounds were
developed and bred

37:31.835 --> 37:34.252
all the way back
in the 16th century

37:34.252 --> 37:35.943
by French monks.

37:35.943 --> 37:38.325
These monks wanted
a dog whose bodies

37:38.325 --> 37:39.947
would be close to the ground

37:39.947 --> 37:42.363
so they could easily
pick up on the scents

37:42.363 --> 37:45.366
of other animals,
both big and small.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.509
They may be short,
but Basset Hounds

37:50.509 --> 37:51.786
are kind of heavy,

37:51.786 --> 37:55.273
standing at only about
11 to 15 inches tall,

37:55.273 --> 37:57.723
this beast can end
up weighing anywhere

37:57.723 --> 38:01.175
from 50 to 65 pounds.

38:01.175 --> 38:03.591
Now that's a sideways
fire hydrant.

38:04.868 --> 38:06.801
How did they get their names?

38:06.801 --> 38:08.286
Well, I'm glad you asked.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.771
I told you already
that the Basset Hound

38:10.771 --> 38:12.980
originally came from France,

38:12.980 --> 38:15.189
so it makes sense
that their names

38:15.189 --> 38:17.295
came from the French language.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.918
Basset comes from the word "bas"

38:19.918 --> 38:22.265
that means low in French.

38:22.265 --> 38:23.922
How about that?

38:23.922 --> 38:26.511
[catchy music]

38:29.099 --> 38:31.895
Even though Basset Hounds
make great hunters,

38:31.895 --> 38:35.002
they're also so cute and sweet.

38:35.002 --> 38:37.211
These guys look kind of sad,

38:37.211 --> 38:39.144
but they're totally not.

38:39.144 --> 38:42.458
It's those deep set in
face with loose skin

38:42.458 --> 38:44.908
and wrinkles that make
them look that way.

38:44.908 --> 38:47.221
They're actually
very happy animals

38:47.221 --> 38:49.292
with super cute, long ears,

38:49.292 --> 38:52.916
a very long body, and
stubby, short little legs

38:52.916 --> 38:55.160
with really big paws on 'em.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.473
Take all that, and add in a tail

38:57.473 --> 38:59.613
that sticks straight
up on their body,

38:59.613 --> 39:03.030
and you have the
recipe for adorable.

39:03.030 --> 39:06.102
Well, adorable and loud.

39:06.102 --> 39:09.830
Basset Hounds bark
and howl a whole lot.

39:09.830 --> 39:12.142
In fact, that's part
of how the Basset Hound

39:12.142 --> 39:13.454
got so famous.

39:13.454 --> 39:16.112
A long time ago in
the southern U.S.,

39:16.112 --> 39:18.942
hunters and other
owners of Basset Hounds

39:18.942 --> 39:22.429
would feed their dogs easy
to make fried cornballs

39:22.429 --> 39:24.534
to quiet their barking buddies.

39:24.534 --> 39:28.366
These treats eventually
became known as hush puppies,

39:28.366 --> 39:30.885
and now they're people
treats! [laughs]

39:30.885 --> 39:32.577
Isn't that funny?

39:32.577 --> 39:35.165
[catchy music]

39:37.202 --> 39:40.205
Over the years, Basset
Hounds became very popular

39:40.205 --> 39:42.310
and they're features
in lots of movies,

39:42.310 --> 39:45.486
advertisements,
and even cartoons.

39:45.486 --> 39:47.833
They're so famous
that they even have

39:47.833 --> 39:52.044
a brand of shoes named after
them called Hush Puppies.

39:52.044 --> 39:55.496
In fact, Basset Hounds are
still the official mascot

39:55.496 --> 39:58.292
of this popular, comfy shoe.

39:58.292 --> 39:59.327
How neat.

40:01.088 --> 40:02.710
- Great!

40:02.710 --> 40:04.298
Bassets are so fun.

40:04.298 --> 40:06.645
- Who loves bulldogs?

40:06.645 --> 40:07.888
- Me!

40:07.888 --> 40:10.477
Did I ever tell you guys
my cousin Tricks and--

40:10.477 --> 40:11.512
- Let me guess.

40:11.512 --> 40:13.583
Cousin Tricks is a bulldog?

40:13.583 --> 40:14.929
- Yup!

40:14.929 --> 40:17.760
- What's a friendly
dog that snores a lot

40:17.760 --> 40:19.140
while farting?

40:19.140 --> 40:20.832
[chuckles] Wanna
meet that fella?

40:20.832 --> 40:23.282
I'm sure you do. [chuckles]

40:23.282 --> 40:25.699
We're talking about
a bold little dog

40:25.699 --> 40:27.908
known as the bulldog!

40:29.219 --> 40:32.050
Bulldogs are great
medium-sized companion dogs

40:32.050 --> 40:35.398
that were created way
back in the 16th century

40:35.398 --> 40:38.539
when dog breeders mixed
Mastiffs and pugs.

40:38.539 --> 40:41.128
The result of that
mixing is adorable

40:41.128 --> 40:42.681
in every way.

40:44.303 --> 40:47.479
Bulldogs have sort of
an unusual look to them,

40:47.479 --> 40:50.206
and because of that,
you can always find them

40:50.206 --> 40:52.277
in movies and on TV.

40:52.277 --> 40:55.522
In fact, they're one of
the most popular dogs

40:55.522 --> 40:57.765
in the whole wide world.

40:59.215 --> 41:02.839
A bulldog can grow to be
about 12 to 16 inches tall,

41:02.839 --> 41:06.015
weighing in around
40 to 50 pounds.

41:06.015 --> 41:08.776
That's pretty heavy
for such a small pooch.

41:10.364 --> 41:12.193
They have short, smooth coats

41:12.193 --> 41:14.230
that come in lots of varieties,

41:14.230 --> 41:16.335
but it's their cute little faces

41:16.335 --> 41:19.166
that make them so good looking.

41:20.926 --> 41:25.034
Bulldogs have wide
jaws and short snouts.

41:25.034 --> 41:28.382
The skin on their faces
looks wrinkled and loose,

41:28.382 --> 41:30.142
and the teeth on
their lower jaws

41:30.142 --> 41:32.938
stick out over their top jaws.

41:32.938 --> 41:35.251
They have big,
muscular shoulders,

41:35.251 --> 41:37.529
short bodies, powerful legs,

41:37.529 --> 41:40.014
and tiny little tails.

41:40.014 --> 41:40.843
Aw.

41:42.983 --> 41:45.399
If you couldn't guess
by looking at them,

41:45.399 --> 41:47.988
bulldogs can be super stubborn.

41:47.988 --> 41:51.405
But with proper training,
they can be very obedient,

41:51.405 --> 41:54.063
and also become great athletes.

41:55.823 --> 41:59.482
Though they are hardheaded,
bulldogs are also smart,

41:59.482 --> 42:03.382
and become friendly animals
that are perfect for families.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.489
Yes, bulldogs look heavy,

42:06.489 --> 42:09.250
but they're also
pretty quick and agile.

42:09.250 --> 42:13.047
An adult bulldog can run
up to 15 miles per hour

42:13.047 --> 42:16.637
and even jump about
seven feet in the air!

42:16.637 --> 42:17.742
Whoa!

42:17.742 --> 42:20.261
Can you say "Air Bulldog"?

42:20.261 --> 42:23.126
They'd rather stay in the
air, or on the ground,

42:23.126 --> 42:26.613
because these dogs
are not good swimmers.

42:26.613 --> 42:31.134
So if you have a pool, just
remember that little tidbit.

42:32.515 --> 42:33.999
- Are dachshunds next?

42:33.999 --> 42:35.242
- Yes they are!

42:35.242 --> 42:36.381
How did you know?

42:36.381 --> 42:39.557
- K-9 intuition!

42:39.557 --> 42:42.283
- Hot diggity dog!

42:42.283 --> 42:45.735
Our next barking buddy
is a real wiener.

42:45.735 --> 42:46.978
[chuckles]

42:46.978 --> 42:48.358
Get ready to meet the
cute little critter

42:48.358 --> 42:50.119
known as the dachshund!

42:51.776 --> 42:54.710
Dachshunds just happen
to be the 11th most

42:54.710 --> 42:57.678
popular breed of doggy
in the United States,

42:57.678 --> 43:00.508
and it's super easy to see why.

43:00.508 --> 43:03.788
They are adorable.

43:03.788 --> 43:06.618
Dachshunds grow to be
about nine inches tall,

43:06.618 --> 43:10.518
and can weigh in anywhere
from 15 to 30 pounds.

43:10.518 --> 43:13.556
Mini dachshunds
usually weigh about 11.

43:13.556 --> 43:15.351
Such cutie pies.

43:16.524 --> 43:18.734
Dachshunds are super
popular for being

43:18.734 --> 43:20.598
what's known as a wiener dog

43:20.598 --> 43:22.600
because of their
short, stubby legs

43:22.600 --> 43:24.498
and their long bodies.

43:24.498 --> 43:26.431
They have two types of coats,

43:26.431 --> 43:29.123
either smooth, or long and wiry.

43:29.123 --> 43:31.298
Even cooler though, they come in

43:31.298 --> 43:33.611
at a whopping 12 colors,

43:33.611 --> 43:35.474
and at least different patterns

43:35.474 --> 43:38.581
like sable, brindle, or mottled.

43:38.581 --> 43:42.171
[lighthearted piano music]

43:45.105 --> 43:47.072
Dachshunds have
long heads to match

43:47.072 --> 43:48.936
their long, muscular bodies,

43:48.936 --> 43:51.629
and are complete
with a long tail.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.632
They have beautiful
eyes and floppy ears

43:54.632 --> 43:56.910
hanging off their little faces.

43:56.910 --> 43:58.566
How darling is that?

44:00.638 --> 44:04.365
The name dachshund actually
means "badger dog" in German.

44:04.365 --> 44:05.712
Why?

44:05.712 --> 44:07.783
Because of their
incredible sense of smell,

44:07.783 --> 44:10.061
dachshunds were used
to hunt badgers,

44:10.061 --> 44:11.821
foxes, and rabbits.

44:11.821 --> 44:14.030
Their tiny legs were
made for digging,

44:14.030 --> 44:16.688
so they could get their
prizes either above

44:16.688 --> 44:18.656
or below ground.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.174
How about that?

44:20.174 --> 44:22.625
[lighthearted piano music]

44:22.625 --> 44:25.766
Dachshunds are known
to be very brave,

44:25.766 --> 44:28.320
they're also smart
and energetic animals

44:28.320 --> 44:31.876
that have a habit of being
pretty darn stubborn.

44:31.876 --> 44:33.601
Instead of listening to you,

44:33.601 --> 44:35.914
they would rather be
chasing other animals

44:35.914 --> 44:37.605
or even birds.

44:37.605 --> 44:39.953
In a pinch, a nice, fun toy

44:39.953 --> 44:41.955
will keep them very occupied.

44:43.094 --> 44:44.716
They may be tough to teach,

44:44.716 --> 44:48.271
but holy cow, are they loving.

44:48.271 --> 44:49.894
Dachshunds have
been known to bond

44:49.894 --> 44:52.586
with their human
families super quick,

44:52.586 --> 44:54.381
and they always
want to be a part

44:54.381 --> 44:56.590
of whatever is going on.

44:56.590 --> 44:59.766
They're just all
around fun play-mates.

44:59.766 --> 45:01.837
Hooray for that!

45:01.837 --> 45:03.286
- I had a play-mate
who was a dachshund

45:03.286 --> 45:05.633
when I used to go to
doggy daycare as a puppy.

45:05.633 --> 45:06.738
- Yeah?

45:06.738 --> 45:07.912
Did you like him?

45:07.912 --> 45:10.638
- Nah, he was annoying
as all get out.

45:10.638 --> 45:12.123
- I can see that!

45:12.123 --> 45:15.782
How about the Dalmatian,
Professor Fetch?

45:15.782 --> 45:19.889
- I'd guess you have
at least 101 reasons

45:19.889 --> 45:23.410
to love our next dog
breed, the Dalmatian!

45:23.410 --> 45:25.412
Not only are they superstars,

45:25.412 --> 45:28.035
but they're also some
of the bravest dogs

45:28.035 --> 45:30.313
in the whole wide world!

45:31.452 --> 45:34.317
Dalmatians are also
known as "dau".

45:34.317 --> 45:36.078
They're an ancient
breed of pooch,

45:36.078 --> 45:39.357
but no one seems to know
exactly where they came from,

45:39.357 --> 45:40.530
it's a mystery.

45:41.566 --> 45:43.706
Breeders and
researches all believe

45:43.706 --> 45:46.226
that these wonderful
dogs came to the world

45:46.226 --> 45:48.746
from the Dalmatia
area of Croatia.

45:48.746 --> 45:52.508
Given the name, that
makes perfect sense!

45:52.508 --> 45:55.166
[intense music]

46:00.033 --> 46:01.551
Wanna know something cool?

46:01.551 --> 46:02.794
Of course you do!

46:02.794 --> 46:05.279
Archeologists have
even uncovered

46:05.279 --> 46:06.694
pictures of Dalmatians

46:06.694 --> 46:09.836
on the walls of
Ancient Egyptian tombs,

46:09.836 --> 46:12.355
and that means that
ancient Dalmatians

46:12.355 --> 46:14.564
even scampered around Egypt!

46:14.564 --> 46:17.222
Whoa, now that's amazing.

46:19.949 --> 46:23.228
Today, Dalmatians are
used as popular house pets

46:23.228 --> 46:25.403
and also as rescue dogs.

46:25.403 --> 46:27.646
For a long while,
they were even known

46:27.646 --> 46:29.856
as carriage dogs
because they have a

46:29.856 --> 46:32.824
super friendly
relationship with horses.

46:32.824 --> 46:35.102
For many years, horses were used

46:35.102 --> 46:37.415
to help speed along
fire carriages,

46:37.415 --> 46:40.452
and the Dalmatians
have a cool ability

46:40.452 --> 46:43.628
to keep horses
calm around fires.

46:43.628 --> 46:45.768
So, for the longest time,

46:45.768 --> 46:47.528
they've been
traveling with firemen

46:47.528 --> 46:51.015
and other heroes to help
get people out of danger.

46:51.015 --> 46:52.637
Talk about brave.

46:53.776 --> 46:55.882
A Dalmatian can
grow to be anywhere

46:55.882 --> 46:58.505
from 19 to 23 inches tall,

46:58.505 --> 47:01.715
weighing in around
40 to 70 pounds.

47:01.715 --> 47:03.993
They have really
short, smooth hair,

47:03.993 --> 47:06.927
and are usually white
with black spots on them.

47:06.927 --> 47:09.309
Every Dalmatian has
a unique pattern,

47:09.309 --> 47:12.277
and no two Dalmatians
look alike.

47:12.277 --> 47:13.589
Now that's interesting.

47:16.109 --> 47:19.837
These superhero dogs have
large, muscular bodies,

47:19.837 --> 47:22.287
thin ears, and super long legs

47:22.287 --> 47:24.151
with cute, round little feet.

47:25.187 --> 47:26.809
These dudes can run for hours

47:26.809 --> 47:27.914
without getting tired,

47:27.914 --> 47:29.985
and during the Second World War,

47:29.985 --> 47:32.401
they were used to
send secret messages

47:32.401 --> 47:34.610
back and forth between troops.

47:34.610 --> 47:38.407
They truly were like
the first animal spies.

47:38.407 --> 47:39.995
Now that's impressive!

47:41.410 --> 47:43.481
Dalmatians love to
play in the water,

47:43.481 --> 47:45.586
and are very good swimmers.

47:45.586 --> 47:47.519
They require a lot
of training though

47:47.519 --> 47:50.626
because they're also
very independent animals

47:50.626 --> 47:52.904
who make awesome guard dogs.

47:53.974 --> 47:55.044
- Wow!

47:55.044 --> 47:58.013
Dalmatians are so interesting!

47:58.013 --> 47:59.842
There's no other
dog quite like 'em.

47:59.842 --> 48:01.879
- Same goes for the pug.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.777
Did you know it's
easier on the pug

48:03.777 --> 48:05.399
to raise two pugs together?

48:05.399 --> 48:07.401
- I didn't know that, Professor.

48:07.401 --> 48:09.334
What else do you
know about the pug?

48:09.334 --> 48:10.680
- Let's find out!

48:10.680 --> 48:13.442
It's time to get cute.

48:13.442 --> 48:16.894
Our next kind of dog is
as cute as they come.

48:16.894 --> 48:19.379
Get ready to meet the pug!

48:19.379 --> 48:21.381
A small, toy-sized
animal that is

48:21.381 --> 48:24.936
one of the best companion
dogs you could ever have.

48:26.627 --> 48:29.837
Pugs were bred about
200 years B.C. in China,

48:29.837 --> 48:32.116
and specifically
for the Emperor,

48:32.116 --> 48:34.808
who wanted the perfect lap dog.

48:34.808 --> 48:36.672
How's that for important?

48:36.672 --> 48:39.399
Pug were created to be royalty.

48:40.779 --> 48:43.921
Pugs made their way to
Europe in the 16th century,

48:43.921 --> 48:47.303
and became a very
popular breed of dog.

48:47.303 --> 48:49.581
Now, you can find
these little guys

48:49.581 --> 48:51.618
all over the world.

48:52.999 --> 48:55.346
Because they're so
small and friendly,

48:55.346 --> 48:59.005
they make for great pals
for just about anyone.

48:59.005 --> 49:02.353
No matter how old or young!

49:02.353 --> 49:04.700
These little dudes and
dudettes grow to be

49:04.700 --> 49:06.667
about 14 inches tall,

49:06.667 --> 49:09.947
and weigh in around
14 to 18 pounds.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.707
They have really short hair,

49:11.707 --> 49:13.364
and can vary in color,

49:13.364 --> 49:16.919
but their cute little
noses are always black.

49:16.919 --> 49:19.163
So adorable!

49:19.163 --> 49:21.786
Speaking of their
faces, pugs always look

49:21.786 --> 49:24.375
like they've been
squished in and wrinkled.

49:24.375 --> 49:28.068
This makes their big eyes
all the more lovable.

49:28.068 --> 49:30.795
They're known for
their adorable faces,

49:30.795 --> 49:35.110
short little legs,
and tiny, curly tails.

49:35.110 --> 49:36.835
How cute is that?

49:36.835 --> 49:38.768
Make some room in your bed,

49:38.768 --> 49:43.014
pugs enjoy this one thing
more than anything else.

49:43.014 --> 49:44.498
Sleeping.

49:44.498 --> 49:46.500
They get tired super easily,

49:46.500 --> 49:51.091
and will sleep around
14 hours every day.

49:51.091 --> 49:53.404
Don't expect them
to bring that stick,

49:53.404 --> 49:56.027
ball, or bone back anytime soon,

49:56.027 --> 49:58.685
they don't really
like to play fetch,

49:58.685 --> 50:00.998
and are actually hard to train

50:00.998 --> 50:03.138
because they're so stubborn.

50:03.138 --> 50:05.519
Pugs would rather
just eat, sleep,

50:05.519 --> 50:08.005
love you, sleep some more, poop,

50:08.005 --> 50:11.456
sleep, kiss you, and
then sleep some more,

50:11.456 --> 50:13.320
more than anything else!

50:14.528 --> 50:17.117
They can run about three
to seven miles per hour,

50:17.117 --> 50:18.946
and for a four legged animal,

50:18.946 --> 50:21.949
they're notoriously
bad swimmers.

50:21.949 --> 50:23.917
They may be small animals,

50:23.917 --> 50:26.747
but pugs have huge
personalities.

50:28.163 --> 50:32.236
When they are awake, pugs
are super playful and loyal.

50:32.236 --> 50:34.100
They're very
interested in people,

50:34.100 --> 50:36.930
and will often follow their
owners around the house

50:36.930 --> 50:40.278
to always be near them and
see what they're doing.

50:40.278 --> 50:42.487
Pugs also love to lay in laps,

50:42.487 --> 50:44.558
and sleep with
their human owners

50:44.558 --> 50:47.044
as much as possible.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.114
Aw!

50:48.114 --> 50:50.599
- Incredible, Professor Fetch.

50:50.599 --> 50:53.153
We're learning so much
in such a short time.

50:53.153 --> 50:55.500
It feels like my
brain might burst.

50:55.500 --> 50:56.743
[laughs]

50:56.743 --> 50:59.125
- I don't think your
brains can burst, Mugs,

50:59.125 --> 51:00.712
but they might get bigger,

51:00.712 --> 51:02.059
and we're not done yet.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.094
- Bring it on!

51:04.061 --> 51:04.889
- Oh my!

51:06.063 --> 51:07.926
You'd better have
a pillow ready,

51:07.926 --> 51:10.308
because by the time
I'm done telling you

51:10.308 --> 51:13.173
about the Energizer
Bunny of the dog world,

51:13.173 --> 51:14.864
the Jack Russell Terrier,

51:14.864 --> 51:18.834
I can almost guarantee
you're gonna need some rest.

51:20.594 --> 51:24.115
Jack Russell Terriers were
created in jolly old England

51:24.115 --> 51:27.118
at the very beginning
of the 19th century.

51:27.118 --> 51:29.431
These cuties are
the direct relatives

51:29.431 --> 51:33.193
of what is now known as the
extinct British White Terrier.

51:34.505 --> 51:37.094
Jack Russells are
incredible hunters,

51:37.094 --> 51:39.303
but nowadays people
usually keep them

51:39.303 --> 51:40.994
as companion dogs.

51:42.651 --> 51:45.136
If there's one thing
that Jack Russells

51:45.136 --> 51:46.482
do better than hunt,

51:46.482 --> 51:48.553
it's be great friends.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.143
The Jack Russell
Terrier can grow to be

51:52.143 --> 51:54.697
anywhere from 10
to 15 inches tall,

51:54.697 --> 51:58.598
and usually weighs
around 14 to 18 pounds.

51:58.598 --> 52:00.462
They generally have white coats

52:00.462 --> 52:02.429
with black and tan markings,

52:02.429 --> 52:05.294
but sometimes can just
be white and brown.

52:06.985 --> 52:08.470
Speaking of their fur,

52:08.470 --> 52:11.438
Jack Russells have
three kinds of coats.

52:11.438 --> 52:14.200
Short and smooth,
long and rough,

52:14.200 --> 52:16.478
or a combination of both.

52:16.478 --> 52:19.550
They have little eyes that
are shaped like almonds,

52:19.550 --> 52:21.517
tiny, triangular ears,

52:21.517 --> 52:24.865
and small but sturdy bodies.

52:24.865 --> 52:27.972
[lighthearted music]

52:29.698 --> 52:33.219
And my goodness, is the
Jack Russell active.

52:33.219 --> 52:36.049
You can even call
them hyperactive!

52:36.049 --> 52:39.397
They just keep going,
and going, and going,

52:39.397 --> 52:41.675
and going, and going.

52:41.675 --> 52:43.332
They love playing with balls,

52:43.332 --> 52:44.437
digging in the dirt,

52:44.437 --> 52:46.301
and of course, exploring.

52:46.301 --> 52:48.993
You have to teach them
at a very young age

52:48.993 --> 52:50.270
how to be calm,

52:50.270 --> 52:53.618
or you'll own a friendly
four-legged comet

52:53.618 --> 52:56.690
that speeds around your
house insanely happy

52:56.690 --> 52:58.727
for the rest of its life.

52:58.727 --> 52:59.624
How about that?

53:01.626 --> 53:03.904
Because they enjoy
running so much,

53:03.904 --> 53:07.287
the Jack Russell Terrier
needs a lot of space.

53:07.287 --> 53:09.462
These little poaches
need big houses

53:09.462 --> 53:12.154
and big backyards to run around.

53:12.154 --> 53:14.846
That's probably the only
thing that will make them

53:14.846 --> 53:18.850
tired enough to sit still
for even five minutes.

53:18.850 --> 53:20.404
Zoom!

53:20.404 --> 53:24.201
- Jacks, so playful, so smart.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.479
- Same goes for poodles, guys.

53:26.479 --> 53:27.928
- Oh, poodles!

53:29.102 --> 53:30.207
[laughing]

53:30.207 --> 53:32.312
So fluffy too.

53:32.312 --> 53:35.281
- Time to check in
with a cuddly dog

53:35.281 --> 53:37.869
who's super famous
for having one of the

53:37.869 --> 53:42.219
coolest and most recognizable
haircuts in the world.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.704
Say hello to the poodle!

53:44.704 --> 53:47.258
[catchy music]

53:48.432 --> 53:50.641
The poodles as we
know them today

53:50.641 --> 53:54.817
were created in Germany during
the 15th or 16th century,

53:54.817 --> 53:58.338
and they were originally
used for hunting birds

53:58.338 --> 54:01.445
who hung out and made
their nests around water.

54:01.445 --> 54:05.863
Then, very quickly, they
became super popular in Europe,

54:05.863 --> 54:08.348
especially when it
came to royalty.

54:08.348 --> 54:09.729
Well, could you blame them?

54:09.729 --> 54:12.214
Who wouldn't want to
cuddle with a poodle?

54:15.044 --> 54:19.186
To this day, poodles are
still very popular house pets.

54:19.186 --> 54:21.810
Not only are their
appearances charming,

54:21.810 --> 54:24.191
but so are their personalities.

54:25.503 --> 54:28.575
There are three kinds
of poodles, standard,

54:28.575 --> 54:31.440
miniature, and even toy poodles

54:31.440 --> 54:33.891
which are super small!

54:33.891 --> 54:36.169
A standard poodle
will grow anywhere

54:36.169 --> 54:38.447
from 11 to 22 inches tall,

54:38.447 --> 54:41.036
and weigh around 60 pounds.

54:42.451 --> 54:45.247
Poodles have fluffy coats
that come in lots of colors

54:45.247 --> 54:47.836
from black to blue,
red to silver,

54:47.836 --> 54:50.045
and even beige and white.

54:50.045 --> 54:53.117
They have cute, round
heads with long noses,

54:53.117 --> 54:54.981
cute oval shaped peepers,

54:54.981 --> 54:57.259
and long, flat ears.

54:57.259 --> 55:00.297
Their tails are also
pretty noticeable too,

55:00.297 --> 55:03.161
as they stand straight up high.

55:03.161 --> 55:04.508
How cute is that?

55:06.095 --> 55:09.996
And get this,
poodles are so smart.

55:09.996 --> 55:13.931
In fact, poodles are the second
smartest dog on the planet,

55:13.931 --> 55:16.416
right next to the Border Collie.

55:16.416 --> 55:17.624
Whoa!

55:17.624 --> 55:20.213
They are really,
really easy to train,

55:20.213 --> 55:22.767
and learn tricks super fast.

55:22.767 --> 55:25.011
Because they do learn
tricks so quickly,

55:25.011 --> 55:28.325
they were a staple in
circus acts of yesteryear.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.844
They can perform anything,

55:30.844 --> 55:33.847
even dancing around on two legs.

55:33.847 --> 55:36.402
[catchy music]

55:38.507 --> 55:40.716
Poodles are super loving animals

55:40.716 --> 55:43.236
and adore kids and other pets.

55:45.031 --> 55:46.964
They're also very loud.

55:46.964 --> 55:50.485
If you have a guest or
someone comes to your door,

55:50.485 --> 55:52.935
they're going to
tell you about it.

55:52.935 --> 55:55.352
They're loud but never mean.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.250
They are as sweet as could be,

55:57.250 --> 55:59.735
and that makes them
perfect therapy dogs

55:59.735 --> 56:03.360
for people with handicaps,
or of course, the elderly.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.740
How sweet.

56:07.571 --> 56:09.780
- The Maltese is
pretty cool too!

56:09.780 --> 56:12.023
I've always wanted to know
more about those dogs.

56:12.023 --> 56:14.129
- Well, here's
your chance, Mugs.

56:14.129 --> 56:17.097
But be prepared for
high levels of cuteness.

56:17.097 --> 56:18.547
Let's check them out.

56:18.547 --> 56:19.548
- All right!

56:19.548 --> 56:22.586
- Get ready to bow wow wow,

56:22.586 --> 56:26.521
because we're going to
learn about pooch royalty.

56:26.521 --> 56:28.799
Here's one of the
favorite dog breeds

56:28.799 --> 56:31.353
of the wealthy folks
in the Mediterranean,

56:31.353 --> 56:32.699
the Maltese!

56:33.942 --> 56:35.633
The Maltese comes to the world

56:35.633 --> 56:37.394
from the island of Malta,

56:37.394 --> 56:40.327
where it enjoyed its
status of canine royalty

56:40.327 --> 56:44.124
for a whopping 28 centuries.

56:44.124 --> 56:46.333
That's a long time!

56:46.333 --> 56:49.095
The Maltese came to the
United States of America

56:49.095 --> 56:53.168
for an 1887 showing
at the world famous

56:53.168 --> 56:54.687
Westminster Kennel Club.

56:56.067 --> 56:59.864
Like royalty, the Maltese
have a very refined

56:59.864 --> 57:01.797
and dignified look to them.

57:01.797 --> 57:04.110
They have small,
cute little bodies,

57:04.110 --> 57:06.319
and silky straight
hair that flows

57:06.319 --> 57:08.908
all the way down to the ground.

57:08.908 --> 57:10.806
Maltese are usually white,

57:10.806 --> 57:13.084
and their little
black noses and eyes

57:13.084 --> 57:16.156
make them look simply adorable.

57:17.088 --> 57:18.089
[sneezing]

57:18.089 --> 57:19.470
Bless you. [laughs]

57:19.470 --> 57:23.094
Don't worry, you're not
sneezing because of the Maltese.

57:23.094 --> 57:25.787
These dogs have no undercoats,

57:25.787 --> 57:27.340
so they don't shed much,

57:27.340 --> 57:31.448
and are what's known as
a hypo-allergenic dog.

57:31.448 --> 57:34.105
No sneezes around
these little pleasers.

57:37.488 --> 57:40.629
A Maltese can grow to
about 10 inches tall,

57:40.629 --> 57:43.460
and weigh around
four to seven pounds.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.876
Most of that is probably hair.

57:45.876 --> 57:48.775
Their hair is so long
that usually owners

57:48.775 --> 57:50.743
tie it in a knot with a bow

57:50.743 --> 57:54.022
just so the dog can
see where it's going.

57:54.022 --> 57:56.231
[laughs] How bout that?

57:56.231 --> 57:58.785
[catchy music]

58:00.925 --> 58:04.273
These dogs are super
affectionate and lively.

58:04.273 --> 58:05.792
Got a camera handy?

58:05.792 --> 58:07.345
Well, good!

58:07.345 --> 58:10.763
Because the Maltese know how
to ham it up around people.

58:10.763 --> 58:12.523
They want your attention,

58:12.523 --> 58:15.871
and will do just about
anything to get it.

58:15.871 --> 58:18.460
[catchy music]

58:20.289 --> 58:22.499
The Maltese is a playful, fun,

58:22.499 --> 58:24.362
and full of energy dog,

58:24.362 --> 58:28.159
and yep, they will
probably tire you out.

58:28.159 --> 58:28.988
Yikes!

58:28.988 --> 58:29.816
I'm pooped.

58:31.059 --> 58:34.096
- You're right, Professor Fetch!

58:34.096 --> 58:39.101
The Maltese is crazy
cute, and super smart too.

58:40.275 --> 58:42.173
- Oh, can we check out
one more dog, Professor?

58:42.173 --> 58:43.796
- [Slooberstick] Schnauzers?

58:43.796 --> 58:45.211
Oh!

58:45.211 --> 58:46.039
Woo hoo!

58:49.215 --> 58:52.805
- Time to meet another tiny dog.

58:52.805 --> 58:54.323
A mini one, even.

58:54.323 --> 58:55.670
Coming to us from Europe

58:55.670 --> 58:58.742
is the adorable
Miniature Schnauzer.

58:58.742 --> 59:01.089
Let's learn all about them.

59:01.089 --> 59:03.678
[catchy music]

59:05.058 --> 59:07.958
Miniature Schnauzers
are tiny little dogs

59:07.958 --> 59:09.856
that come to the
world as part of the

59:09.856 --> 59:11.858
terrier family of animals.

59:11.858 --> 59:15.172
They were created in Germany
during the 19th century

59:15.172 --> 59:17.519
when breeders mixed
a regular Schnauzer

59:17.519 --> 59:19.866
with Affenpinschers and poodles.

59:21.937 --> 59:24.388
Mini Schnauzers make
great companions

59:24.388 --> 59:27.529
and are also very
popular show dogs.

59:27.529 --> 59:29.013
Currently, they are listed as

59:29.013 --> 59:31.809
one of the 20 most
popular dog breeds

59:31.809 --> 59:33.604
in the United States.

59:33.604 --> 59:35.054
How cool is that?

59:40.680 --> 59:43.165
These tiny dogs can
grow to be anywhere

59:43.165 --> 59:45.582
from 12 to 14 inches tall,

59:45.582 --> 59:49.378
and weigh in anywhere
from 11 to 20 pounds.

59:49.378 --> 59:52.312
They have very clean
and wiry double coats

59:52.312 --> 59:54.107
that are super thick!

59:54.107 --> 59:56.593
Their coat is
usually solid black,

59:56.593 --> 59:59.561
or a combination of
black and another color

59:59.561 --> 01:00:01.390
like white or silver.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:04.704
Miniature Schnauzers have
snouts that are square shaped

01:00:04.704 --> 01:00:06.982
with thick hair on their faces.

01:00:06.982 --> 01:00:11.159
They have long, bushy
eyebrows and long beards.

01:00:11.159 --> 01:00:12.643
How cute!

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:16.543
They have a folded set of
ears and sturdy bodies.

01:00:16.543 --> 01:00:19.443
Schnauzers have short
legs that are super strong

01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:22.446
as well as having
very short tails.

01:00:24.793 --> 01:00:27.451
So, how did they get their name?

01:00:27.451 --> 01:00:31.904
In German, the word "Schnauzer"
translates to muzzle,

01:00:31.904 --> 01:00:34.665
and because the Miniature
Schnauzer's furry faces

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.563
are so recognizable,

01:00:36.563 --> 01:00:39.946
that word ended up
describing them perfectly.

01:00:39.946 --> 01:00:42.639
In fact, their
snouts are so popular

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.262
they have kind of
become their trademark.

01:00:45.262 --> 01:00:46.366
How interesting.

01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:49.956
[catchy music]

01:00:52.545 --> 01:00:55.134
Mini Schnauzers also
have an incredible

01:00:55.134 --> 01:00:56.411
sense of hearing.

01:00:56.411 --> 01:00:58.655
They can hear sounds
that are two times

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.209
higher in pitch than human ears.

01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:03.418
How cool is that?

01:01:03.418 --> 01:01:05.972
[catchy music]

01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:12.047
These dogs are super
happy, caring, and smart.

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:14.705
But they are also
pretty stubborn,

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.811
and require a lot of training

01:01:16.811 --> 01:01:18.778
to become good house pets.

01:01:20.193 --> 01:01:22.713
And that about does
it for today's class.

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.301
- We're done?

01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:25.371
So soon?

01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:26.683
- We sure are.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.340
Did you boys enjoy your
first day at Pooch U?

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.617
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:01:30.617 --> 01:01:32.033
- Excellent!

01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:33.724
I'll see you both back
here tomorrow morning then,

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:35.795
and we'll continue our lessons.

01:01:35.795 --> 01:01:36.727
- Okay!

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:39.419
We'll be here bright and early,

01:01:39.419 --> 01:01:42.250
bushy tail and all. [chuckles]

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.011
- Professor Fetch, I
don't want class to end.

01:01:45.011 --> 01:01:47.704
Is there any way we
can have some homework?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:48.808
- Yeah!

01:01:48.808 --> 01:01:50.499
- My bones!

01:01:50.499 --> 01:01:52.709
In all my years of teaching,

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:56.264
no students have ever asked
to do homework before.

01:01:56.264 --> 01:01:58.024
You two really are serious about

01:01:58.024 --> 01:01:59.992
learning all you
can, aren't you?

01:01:59.992 --> 01:02:00.717
- Yes!

01:02:01.579 --> 01:02:02.719
- Very well.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.928
I'll give you some
homework on this topic.

01:02:04.928 --> 01:02:06.550
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:09.173
- You both can do a round
robin, brain blasting,

01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:11.210
doggy study session
in the comfort

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.729
of your own home.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.213
- And we'll come back refreshed,

01:02:14.213 --> 01:02:17.561
reinvigorated, and ready
to learn evermore tomorrow.

01:02:17.561 --> 01:02:19.770
- Woo hoo!

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:21.013
Let's go!

01:02:21.013 --> 01:02:22.462
[bell rings]

01:02:22.462 --> 01:02:25.672
- Pooch U has already taught
us so much about dogs,

01:02:25.672 --> 01:02:27.813
and it's only our
first day of class.

01:02:27.813 --> 01:02:29.953
- How wild!

01:02:29.953 --> 01:02:32.300
The semester's barely begun,

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.751
I wonder what else
we'll learn about.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.200
- There's just no telling!

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.755
Professor Fetch is
like a mad genius,

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.171
and the classroom is
like his laboratory.

01:02:41.171 --> 01:02:44.450
- Whipping up hot
problem potions

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:47.764
and solving doggy
daydream dilemmas.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.662
- Yeah! [laughs]

01:02:49.662 --> 01:02:51.181
I love Pooch U!

01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:51.975
- So do I.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.461
Let's go home and
chew on some facts

01:02:55.461 --> 01:02:57.394
like it's an old chew.

01:02:58.257 --> 01:02:59.223
- All right!

01:02:59.223 --> 01:03:00.535
My mouth is already drooling.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.367
[dogs barking]

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:11.580
[door shuts]

01:03:12.892 --> 01:03:14.307
Let's take a bag of
kibbles to the living room,
