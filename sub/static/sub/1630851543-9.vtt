[jazz music]

00:05.804 --> 00:12.846
â™ª â™ª

00:18.484 --> 00:20.754
[cheers and applause]

00:20.786 --> 00:22.254
- From the
Penn & Teller Theater

00:22.288 --> 00:24.591
at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas,

00:24.623 --> 00:28.827
here is our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:28.861 --> 00:31.830
[cheers and applause]

00:31.864 --> 00:38.905
â™ª â™ª

00:41.073 --> 00:42.709
- Welcome to "Fool Us."

00:42.741 --> 00:45.110
If you're hungry
for some tasty magic

00:45.145 --> 00:48.081
with the helping of some
well-seasoned entertainers,

00:48.113 --> 00:50.850
then belly up
for tonight's episode.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.786
And as always,

00:52.819 --> 00:57.390
behind it all are the chefs
of chicanery, Penn and Teller.

00:57.423 --> 01:00.460
[cheers and applause]

01:10.804 --> 01:12.171
Fun fact:

01:12.204 --> 01:15.474
Penn and Teller create
each "Fool Us" trophy by hand.

01:15.507 --> 01:17.143
That's why
they're very particular

01:17.176 --> 01:18.811
about who they'll give it to.

01:18.844 --> 01:21.046
They need to be
legitimately fooled

01:21.081 --> 01:23.248
by a world-class magician,

01:23.283 --> 01:25.551
perhaps one that
looks like this.

01:27.887 --> 01:29.289
- I lead a double life.

01:29.322 --> 01:32.258
By day, I'm a professor.
I have a PhD in math.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.328
My dissertation was titled
"Vaught's Two-Cardinal Theorem

01:35.360 --> 01:37.930
and Notions of Minimality
in Continuous Logic,"

01:37.963 --> 01:41.033
which I'm not gonna try
to explain to you right now.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.135
But by night,
I'm a magician.

01:43.168 --> 01:44.938
I perform at venues
like the Magic Castle

01:44.971 --> 01:47.439
doing sleight of hand.

01:47.473 --> 01:50.009
The way I think about
math research is very similar

01:50.043 --> 01:51.377
to the way
I think about magic.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.112
They have a lot in common.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.713
Math research, like magic,

01:54.746 --> 01:57.650
requires a lot of very strange
and beautiful creativity,

01:57.683 --> 02:00.153
and this is the same approach
I take to performing magic

02:00.186 --> 02:02.421
where I want to think outside
of reality

02:02.454 --> 02:05.224
and how I can share
that with my audience.

02:05.257 --> 02:07.826
Tonight, I have a trick
that I spent a lot of time

02:07.861 --> 02:10.530
developing just for the show.

02:10.562 --> 02:13.800
Penn, Teller, this trick
has a little bit of math

02:13.832 --> 02:16.603
and a whole lot of magic.

02:16.635 --> 02:19.671
[cheers and applause]

02:20.973 --> 02:25.110
- Please welcome the math-
magical mind of Tori Noquez.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.847
[cheers and applause]

02:27.881 --> 02:30.650
- I'm a mathematician.
I have a PhD and everything.

02:30.682 --> 02:32.618
And whenever I mentioned
what I do for a living,

02:32.651 --> 02:34.120
the first thing people
always say is,

02:34.153 --> 02:36.088
oh, you're really good
with numbers.

02:36.122 --> 02:40.393
You must spend a lot of time
in Vegas. Nope.

02:40.425 --> 02:41.961
Turns out when people find out
I'm a card magician,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.429
they do the exact same thing.

02:43.462 --> 02:44.796
Oh, you're really good
with playing cards.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.266
You must spend a lot of time
in Vegas.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.968
Still nope.
[laughter]

02:49.002 --> 02:50.670
One of the reasons I don't
spend much time here gambling

02:50.703 --> 02:52.739
is as I'm sure you know,
a lot of these games

02:52.771 --> 02:54.774
are designed
such that the house wins,

02:54.807 --> 02:57.043
so this inspired me
to use my math

02:57.075 --> 02:59.512
and magic skills
to design my own

02:59.545 --> 03:03.316
Vegas-style game in which
the odds are in your favor.

03:03.348 --> 03:05.551
And I brought with me
for us to play.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.252
Rules are simple.
Penn, in a moment,

03:07.287 --> 03:09.122
I'm gonna have you
select a card at random

03:09.155 --> 03:11.591
and Teller,
you're gonna have one chance

03:11.623 --> 03:14.526
to find the position of
that card on this board of 52.

03:14.561 --> 03:17.229
Now I know those odds
sound near-impossible,

03:17.263 --> 03:21.501
but I'll use a little bit
of magic to help you guys out.

03:21.533 --> 03:25.170
All right, Penn, go ahead
and tell me when to stop.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.372
- Stop.
- Right there.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.740
Did you want one more,
one less?

03:28.775 --> 03:30.143
- One less.
- Okay. All right.

03:30.175 --> 03:33.712
So this card right here.
Okay, let's see how you did.

03:33.746 --> 03:38.418
We will not be using
any of these

03:38.450 --> 03:43.456
and we will not be using
any of these.

03:43.489 --> 03:48.260
So our winning card
is the four of hearts.

03:48.293 --> 03:52.998
Perfect. All right, Teller,
you're our player.

03:53.031 --> 03:56.069
And I really think you're gonna
nail this. I know you can win.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.503
In fact, I created this game
so that you could win. Okay?

03:58.538 --> 04:01.974
So I'm feeling really good.
Are you ready? All right.

04:02.008 --> 04:04.377
All I need you to do
is indicate which row

04:04.409 --> 04:08.247
and how many cards
over that four of hearts is.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.850
Fifth row, sixth card.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.353
Okay, so here's the fifth row.

04:13.385 --> 04:16.889
One, two, three, four,
five, six right here.

04:16.923 --> 04:21.261
And are your sure,
do you wanna change your mind?

04:21.293 --> 04:24.930
One more. Okay.
So right here. Perfect.

04:24.963 --> 04:27.834
I'm really excited.
I really think you nailed it.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.302
Okay.

04:30.336 --> 04:33.906
All right, Teller's card.

04:33.939 --> 04:35.375
[audience murmurs]

04:35.408 --> 04:39.112
Six of spades, really?
I thought, you were sure.

04:39.144 --> 04:40.913
All right. Well, you know what?
That's okay.

04:40.947 --> 04:45.050
Because Penn is here
so we can play again.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.653
All right. Penn same deal.
Where's the four of hearts?

04:47.687 --> 04:49.454
- Uh, first card.

04:49.488 --> 04:51.156
- First card, top left.
Right here?

04:51.189 --> 04:53.725
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, bold choice. I like it.

04:53.759 --> 04:55.495
All right.
Let's see what you got here.

04:55.528 --> 04:58.898
I'm feeling even better
about it this time.

04:58.930 --> 05:01.800
Okay.

05:01.834 --> 05:05.538
[audience murmurs]
Oh, jack of diamonds.

05:05.571 --> 05:06.973
And this was supposed
to be an easy game.

05:07.005 --> 05:09.574
This is not going
how I planned it at all.

05:09.608 --> 05:11.711
Alyson, hi.
- Hi.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.112
- Are you busy right now?
- No.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.480
- Do you want to play
a game with us?

05:14.514 --> 05:15.814
- Of course.
- Great.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.149
Before you take your turn,
let me just make sure

05:17.182 --> 05:19.718
the winning card's
actually back here.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.288
Um, yeah.
Teller was pretty close.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.459
In fact, Penn was
a little bit closer.

05:26.492 --> 05:30.028
So Alyson,
where's the four of hearts?

05:30.062 --> 05:32.264
- Second row, third card.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.167
- Second row, third card.
Right here.

05:34.199 --> 05:37.103
- Yes.
- Okay. Are you feeling lucky?

05:37.136 --> 05:39.204
- Always.
- Good. Me, too.

05:39.237 --> 05:43.375
All right.
Let's see how you did.

05:43.408 --> 05:46.512
All right.

05:46.545 --> 05:49.415
Eight of diamonds.
Aw.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.018
Well, that's it.
The game is over

05:52.050 --> 05:55.120
and I was really rooting
for you guys, too.

05:55.153 --> 05:59.024
See, remember when I said that
the odds were in your favor?

05:59.057 --> 06:02.427
Well, unlike most magicians,
I wasn't lying.

06:02.461 --> 06:03.696
The odds really were
in your favor.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.230
And somehow all three of you
managed to defy

06:05.264 --> 06:07.233
those easy odds.

06:07.266 --> 06:12.271
Thing is, other than the
three cards that you selected,

06:12.305 --> 06:14.639
every other card on this board
is four of hearts.

06:14.673 --> 06:17.709
[applause]

06:17.744 --> 06:21.012
And if you can't figure out how
you missed every single time,

06:21.047 --> 06:24.082
then the odds
are that I fooled you.

06:24.117 --> 06:29.122
[cheers and applause]
- Tori Noquez!

06:30.389 --> 06:34.226
So I get the feeling you don't
think like everyone else.

06:34.259 --> 06:38.463
- I do not, no. My research
is in very abstract math

06:38.497 --> 06:41.266
and that happens in, like,
theoretical space

06:41.300 --> 06:42.935
and it's all made up
and imaginary

06:42.968 --> 06:44.569
and, like,
requires a lot of creativity.

06:44.603 --> 06:47.740
- And is it hard to speak
with us mere mortals?

06:47.774 --> 06:50.976
- [chuckles] No, turns out
I'm also a human being, so.

06:51.009 --> 06:54.379
- That's good. Good to know.
So thinking the way you do

06:54.413 --> 06:57.649
probably helps you create
tricks that no one seen before.

06:57.682 --> 06:58.918
- Yeah. You know, I mean

06:58.951 --> 07:00.685
I've trained classically
in magic

07:00.720 --> 07:02.788
and learned all the background,
but then, yeah,

07:02.822 --> 07:04.122
I like to think outside the box

07:04.156 --> 07:05.690
and sometimes I'll think
of something and be like,

07:05.725 --> 07:07.627
has someone else done this?
Have I seen this?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.327
And then like, I'm really
excited when the answer is no,

07:09.362 --> 07:11.531
and I get to work it out.
- That's so cool.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.500
Are you just a high achiever
at everything you do?

07:14.533 --> 07:19.137
- Oh, yeah. I'm a marathoner.
I do everything all the way.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.507
- Wow.
Have you always loved magic?

07:21.540 --> 07:23.074
- Yeah. As a kid,
I was like a science kid.

07:23.108 --> 07:24.410
So I was, like, building
rockets and, like,

07:24.444 --> 07:25.677
blowing stuff up

07:25.711 --> 07:26.978
and, like, setting off
the school fire alarm.

07:27.012 --> 07:30.382
But yeah, when I was 22,
I visited the Magic Castle

07:30.415 --> 07:32.250
for the first time
and I thought it was so cool.

07:32.284 --> 07:34.086
And I was like,
"I wanna be part of this."

07:34.120 --> 07:36.355
- All right. Let's see
if Penn and Teller calculated

07:36.389 --> 07:38.423
how you did your trick.
- All right.

07:38.457 --> 07:41.761
- Tori,
you've done a card trick plot

07:41.793 --> 07:43.295
that we've never seen before.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.396
- Oh.
[chuckles]

07:44.430 --> 07:45.932
- After eight seasons
of "Fool Us"

07:45.965 --> 07:49.468
and actually looking into magic
a little bit before that...

07:49.502 --> 07:50.769
[laughter]

07:50.802 --> 07:52.271
This is a whole
different thing.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.843
That reveal with all the fours
of hearts is just beautiful.

07:56.875 --> 07:57.843
- Thank you.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.444
- And the idea
of given the edge

07:59.478 --> 08:01.747
and all that and the no choice,
but you actually have a choice,

08:01.781 --> 08:03.483
it's a really good plot.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.350
- Thank you.
- And very original.

08:05.384 --> 08:06.886
- Thank you.
- I really loved it.

08:06.918 --> 08:08.254
We're trying to figure out
how you did it.

08:08.286 --> 08:10.490
You know,
it's such a great trick.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.891
And we went down one row
then we had to double back

08:12.925 --> 08:15.026
and try to figure out how to go

08:15.060 --> 08:16.661
and what you were
possibly doing here.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.632
And what people may not know
is if we're right,

08:19.665 --> 08:23.369
which we don't know--[sighs]
we don't know if we are,

08:23.401 --> 08:28.074
but if we're right,
this is surprisingly

08:28.106 --> 08:31.276
not the cheapest trick
to put together

08:31.310 --> 08:33.712
we've ever seen the show.
Cost a little bit of money,

08:33.745 --> 08:36.682
but you seem unflappable
in the whole thing.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.652
But it's a complicated trick
in terms of plot.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.520
It's a beautiful reveal.

08:41.553 --> 08:44.056
So I'm actually eager
to hear the answer.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.591
I tried to drop
a few hints there.

08:46.625 --> 08:49.629
So you tell us,
did you fool us?

08:49.662 --> 08:53.032
- No, you guys figured it out.
- Aw.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.768
It was very entertaining.
Thank you so much.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.403
- Thank you for having me.
- Aw, thank you.

08:57.436 --> 09:02.542
Tori Noquez!
[cheers and applause]

09:02.575 --> 09:04.110
After this break,

09:04.143 --> 09:07.145
we'll find out if we have
a new Fooler in our midst.

09:07.178 --> 09:08.847
Stick around.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.317
â™ª â™ª

09:19.158 --> 09:21.961
[cheers and applause]

09:21.994 --> 09:23.229
Welcome back.

09:23.261 --> 09:26.465
Let our next performer
make themselves known.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.302
[upbeat music]

09:30.336 --> 09:31.571
- My name is Alex Boyer

09:31.604 --> 09:33.471
and I'm from a small town
in Quebec.

09:33.505 --> 09:35.374
Not exactly a hub
for entertainment,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.909
but in Quebec,
we make our own fun.

09:37.943 --> 09:40.278
Cue drum solo.
[drum solo]

09:40.312 --> 09:42.914
I've always
wanted to be a rock drummer.

09:42.948 --> 09:44.716
Why am I doing this?
I have no idea.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.119
But I found my way magic
when I was super young.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.554
And I think magic and music
is kind of the same thing.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.591
I can play with
people's emotion

09:51.624 --> 09:54.894
and make them happy, excited,
I can startle them.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.330
I'm a 6'2"
super sweet teddy bear.

09:57.363 --> 10:01.500
And I'm obsessed with my hair.

10:01.533 --> 10:04.269
Doing magic is actually
the only job I've ever had.

10:04.302 --> 10:06.138
Can I do it in French?

10:06.172 --> 10:10.610
[speaking French]

10:10.643 --> 10:12.845
Can I have some
English subtitles, please? No?

10:12.878 --> 10:15.847
Penn and Teller, what I'm about
to do may not look threatening,

10:15.880 --> 10:18.517
but don't be deceived.
We have lives in the balance.

10:18.551 --> 10:22.254
Not mine, thankfully.
[laughs]

10:22.288 --> 10:25.323
[cheers and applause]

10:27.158 --> 10:31.263
- Please welcome the
danger magic of Alex Boyer.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.231
[cheers and applause]

10:33.264 --> 10:35.868
- [indistinct]

10:35.900 --> 10:39.471
How you guys doing?
- Good.

10:39.504 --> 10:41.006
- Probably wondering why
you're not understanding

10:41.039 --> 10:43.609
what I'm saying right now,
right?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.645
Is because I'm French Canadian.
[laughter]

10:46.678 --> 10:49.081
But seriously though,
what an absolute--

10:49.115 --> 10:51.149
my God, what an absolute honor
to be here tonight

10:51.182 --> 10:53.485
performing in front
of my magic heroes.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.687
And much like you Teller,
I'm speechless.

10:55.721 --> 10:56.788
[laughter]

10:56.822 --> 10:58.423
What is up guys?
My name is Alex Boyer.

10:58.456 --> 11:01.460
And tonight, we're gonna
save someone's life.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.229
One of yours, actually.

11:03.261 --> 11:04.363
It is gonna be

11:04.397 --> 11:08.533
Ngan, Amanda, Scott,
Matt, or Katie.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.503
But one of you
is in grave danger.

11:10.535 --> 11:13.639
So choose wisely.
No pressure.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.207
Behind you there is
five numbered boxes.

11:16.241 --> 11:18.844
And when I snap my fingers,
I want you to switch randomly

11:18.878 --> 11:21.980
until you arrive in the front
of whichever box you choose.

11:22.014 --> 11:22.981
Ready?
- Okay.

11:23.014 --> 11:24.683
- All right, here we go.

11:24.716 --> 11:27.687
[quirky suspenseful music]

11:27.720 --> 11:29.889
[chuckles]
All right.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.823
This one?
Really, really?

11:31.856 --> 11:35.594
I mean, that's your life.
[laughter]

11:35.628 --> 11:36.629
You guys good?
- Yeah.

11:36.662 --> 11:37.863
- Happy?
- Yeah.

11:37.897 --> 11:42.234
- Great.
Now this trick is dangerous.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.969
So I need someone
to share the blame with me

11:44.003 --> 11:45.471
in case something goes wrong.
[laughter]

11:45.504 --> 11:49.408
Alyson, everyone.
Hey!

11:49.442 --> 11:50.442
How're you?
- Good.

11:50.475 --> 11:51.543
- Nice to meet you.
- Me, too.

11:51.576 --> 11:52.677
- Love your outfit, though.
- Thanks.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.179
- Big fan.
- Thank you.

11:54.212 --> 11:58.183
- Alyson here I have five big
cards numbered one to five.

11:58.216 --> 12:03.621
We have one here,
two, three, four, five.

12:03.655 --> 12:05.591
â™ª â™ª

12:05.624 --> 12:09.394
What's, what's--okay.

12:09.427 --> 12:11.864
On that note, let's begin.
[laughter]

12:11.897 --> 12:13.499
A little bit of Canadian humor
for you.

12:13.532 --> 12:15.000
Alyson.
- Yeah.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.368
- Can you take these five cards
for me, please?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.903
And shuffle them face down
just like this.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.138
- Okay.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.706
- And make sure
nobody sees anything.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.041
Great.
Now, in a moment,

12:22.073 --> 12:24.110
I want you to put one card
on the table.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.245
You're doing great and
make sure you don't look at it.

12:26.278 --> 12:27.645
And this card will represent

12:27.679 --> 12:29.481
the life
we're about to save tonight.

12:29.514 --> 12:30.615
- Okay.
- Ready?

12:30.649 --> 12:32.084
- Yeah.
- But hold on.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.320
Make sure you're confident
in your decision as well.

12:34.352 --> 12:35.754
Because I don't want you
to be home tonight

12:35.788 --> 12:37.222
sitting on your couch

12:37.255 --> 12:40.158
thinking, "What if I would have
chosen a different box?

12:40.192 --> 12:42.495
would I have saved
someone's life tonight?"

12:42.528 --> 12:45.798
Or maybe you're gonna be laying
in your bed thinking,

12:45.831 --> 12:49.067
"Damn that guy had
amazing hair."

12:49.100 --> 12:51.504
[laughter]

12:51.537 --> 12:52.937
Alyson, go ahead and place
the one card here.

12:52.971 --> 12:54.974
- [indistinct] for that one.
- Awesome. This one?

12:55.006 --> 12:56.509
- Yeah.
- Great. Now remember

12:56.542 --> 12:58.409
you could have chosen
any one of these cards, right?

12:58.443 --> 12:59.677
But you chose this one.

12:59.711 --> 13:01.379
Now let's see whose life
you saved tonight.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.816
And by the way, thanks for
making a decision for me.

13:03.849 --> 13:08.620
We have number two.
Number two is Matt.

13:08.653 --> 13:11.557
Your life is safe tonight
you can stand behind your box.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.426
Right here. Careful.
Yeah. Amazing.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.663
Now here's the dangerous part,
Penn and Teller.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.764
The rest of you,
when I say your name,

13:19.798 --> 13:22.567
I want you to sit
on your chosen box. Good?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.036
- Okay.
- Here we go.

13:24.068 --> 13:27.273
Let's start with number one.
Katie...

13:27.306 --> 13:29.475
- [chuckles]
- Go ahead.

13:29.508 --> 13:33.211
â™ª â™ª

13:33.245 --> 13:35.313
Go ahead.
Come on, come on, come on.

13:35.346 --> 13:38.817
Yes! One done.
Here we go. Here we go.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.519
[laughter]

13:40.552 --> 13:44.155
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Number three, we have Amanda.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.758
Go ahead, Amanda.

13:45.790 --> 13:47.960
This is not chaotic at all.
[laughter]

13:47.993 --> 13:51.996
Here we go.
Yeah, amazing. Ngan, your turn.

13:52.030 --> 13:54.834
Go ahead, go ahead.
Don't be afraid guys.

13:54.866 --> 13:56.134
Don't be afraid.
Go ahead.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.838
â™ª â™ª

13:59.871 --> 14:02.106
Great.
Now the last one is Scott.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.176
Nervous, buddy?
- Terribly.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.412
- Me too. Can you tell?
- No.

14:06.445 --> 14:07.645
- Okay, cool. Here we go.
[laughter]

14:07.679 --> 14:09.581
Scott, here we go.
Yeah.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.649
Oh yeah. Go ahead, bud.

14:11.683 --> 14:12.951
Yes, we did it!

14:12.985 --> 14:14.586
Thank you guys so much.
Thank you, thank you.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.054
You guys can go grab a seat.

14:16.087 --> 14:17.456
But Matt,
stay there for me, please.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.758
Thank you so much.
Again, thank you. Thank you.

14:19.792 --> 14:23.696
I should probably tell you
why I'm celebrating like this.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.831
Remember at the beginning,
when I told you that Alyson

14:25.865 --> 14:28.333
and I are going to save
someone's life tonight?

14:28.366 --> 14:29.567
- I do remember that.

14:29.601 --> 14:34.874
- Well, Matt, this is
exactly--don't move.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.508
â™ª â™ª

14:36.542 --> 14:38.344
What we've done.

14:38.376 --> 14:39.644
â™ª â™ª

14:39.677 --> 14:42.313
[audience murmurs]

14:42.347 --> 14:44.316
â™ª â™ª

14:44.350 --> 14:45.417
We saved your life tonight,
bud.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.418
- Thank you.
- Happy?

14:46.451 --> 14:47.485
- Happy.

14:47.519 --> 14:48.519
- Go grab a seat.
Thank you so much.

14:48.553 --> 14:49.520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:49.554 --> 14:51.389
[applause]

14:51.423 --> 14:54.293
- Oh, and Matt,
remember the apple?

14:54.326 --> 14:58.297
That was to remind everyone
that an apple a day keeps...

14:58.330 --> 15:02.234
the doctor away. Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

15:02.268 --> 15:05.471
- Alex Boyer.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.440
So is the comedy in Quebec
its own special thing?

15:08.474 --> 15:11.009
- Yeah.
It has a huge scene in Quebec.

15:11.043 --> 15:14.513
It's like one of the biggest
attractions there. It's comedy.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.649
And we have so many great
comedians there.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.150
And yeah, it's a special place.

15:19.183 --> 15:20.719
- Do you feel like
you've developed

15:20.753 --> 15:23.489
a style that is unique to you?
- When I was younger,

15:23.522 --> 15:25.256
I was taking myself
a little bit too seriously.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.991
And I've tried to just
being goofy

15:27.025 --> 15:30.261
a little bit more and stuff.
So I have like an edgy style,

15:30.296 --> 15:32.130
but being goofy,
having fun with people.

15:32.163 --> 15:34.799
That's the whole goal.
So I think, yes.

15:34.832 --> 15:36.634
- Do you still get nervous
when you perform

15:36.668 --> 15:38.269
or is this easy for you?

15:38.303 --> 15:40.205
- I mean, tonight is
a special night, you know,

15:40.239 --> 15:42.540
I'm performing
literally in front of people

15:42.573 --> 15:44.076
I've grown up watching.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.979
So yeah, tonight I was a little
bit nervous, but I'm happy.

15:47.011 --> 15:49.514
I had lots of fun
and it's a dream come true.

15:49.548 --> 15:50.982
- And you didn't kill anyone.

15:51.015 --> 15:52.451
- I didn't kill anyone, yeah.
- Whoo.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.919
[laughter]
- [indistinct]

15:54.953 --> 15:58.691
- All right, Alex, let's see
if he fooled Penn and Teller.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.359
- All right.
- Hey Alex, you know,

16:00.392 --> 16:02.695
we've been doing this show
a long time

16:02.727 --> 16:05.197
and we love firsts on the show.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.700
And season one,
there were a lot of firsts.

16:07.732 --> 16:09.335
It was the first season.
- Right.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.635
- And then it went on
and on and on

16:10.668 --> 16:13.572
and we get fewer
and fewer firsts.

16:13.605 --> 16:16.607
But this, we're not talking
about your magnetic personality

16:16.642 --> 16:19.544
or how you did all the jokes
or being French Canadian.

16:19.577 --> 16:20.913
We had French Canadians before.
- Yeah.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.448
- We've got Canadians before,
that's not a first.

16:23.481 --> 16:25.918
We've had danger magic,
that's not a first.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.019
But you are without a doubt

16:28.052 --> 16:32.825
the very first butt stab
we've had on the show.

16:32.857 --> 16:34.559
We were very excited
about that.

16:34.592 --> 16:37.162
A true possible impalement.
- Thank you.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.697
- And it was a great,
great act.

16:39.731 --> 16:41.165
- Thank you, guys, so much.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.467
- You have a great personality.
It was very, very good.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.168
We also liked,
like our buddy Piff,

16:44.202 --> 16:46.270
we like people eating
during the show

16:46.304 --> 16:49.140
and the apple thing
at the end really, really good.

16:49.173 --> 16:52.778
But I think I snuck
in the word somewhere.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.581
Not the word butt
and not the word stab

16:55.614 --> 16:58.584
and not the word
French Canadian--two words.

16:58.616 --> 17:01.919
But somewhere in there,
they had something, an idea,

17:01.953 --> 17:03.455
a pretty good idea
of how you did it.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.655
- Absolutely, yeah.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.790
- Did they know
how you did your trick?

17:05.824 --> 17:07.625
- I think so.
I think so, yeah.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.428
- Aw, well, thank you so much.
- It's all good.

17:09.461 --> 17:11.864
Thank you, guys, so much.
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.133
- Alex Boyer.
[cheers and applause]

17:14.165 --> 17:16.701
Penn and Teller
will take on more magicians

17:16.734 --> 17:18.069
and then finish the show

17:18.103 --> 17:21.173
by performing one of their own
amazing tricks.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.410
So stick around.
[cheers and applause]

17:32.750 --> 17:35.621
[cheers and applause]

17:35.653 --> 17:38.656
- "Fool Us" is back
and ready for almost anything.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.692
Let's see if this next magician
can surprise us.

17:43.895 --> 17:46.164
- I'm a magician
first and foremost

17:46.198 --> 17:48.567
and magic really
is my passion.

17:48.599 --> 17:51.636
But I also co-founded
a magic company

17:51.670 --> 17:54.740
and we produce magic tricks
for other magicians.

17:54.772 --> 17:57.342
I've kept pretty busy
running a magic company

17:57.375 --> 17:59.978
and we sell magic to magicians
all over the world.

18:00.011 --> 18:01.313
We've even produced
a few tricks

18:01.346 --> 18:03.147
that have appeared
on "Fool Us"

18:03.182 --> 18:05.349
and some have even
fooled Penn and Teller,

18:05.384 --> 18:08.252
but I still think of my real
job as being a performer.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.655
I only create magic
that I'd want to do.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.023
That's the approach.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.625
Because if I can't see myself
doing the trick,

18:13.659 --> 18:16.028
then I can't see other
magicians doing it either.

18:16.060 --> 18:18.529
I'm not supporting
anyone else's vision tonight

18:18.564 --> 18:20.865
nor underwriting
another magician's dream.

18:20.898 --> 18:23.535
I've created a brand-new
effect to perform tonight.

18:23.568 --> 18:25.636
This time, I'm here for me.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.707
[cheers and applause]

18:30.409 --> 18:32.243
- Returning to the "Fool Us"
stage

18:32.277 --> 18:36.280
all the way from London,
Andi Gladwin.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.150
[cheers and applause]

18:38.182 --> 18:41.953
- More than 45 years ago,
a circus school graduate

18:41.987 --> 18:45.124
and a Latin high school teacher
met for the first time

18:45.156 --> 18:46.557
and formed one of the most

18:46.592 --> 18:50.229
iconic double acts
of their generation.

18:50.261 --> 18:53.265
Now I can't tell you
the odds of Penn meeting Teller

18:53.298 --> 18:56.535
that day,
but I can help recreate them.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.002
I'm gonna give Penn and Teller

18:58.036 --> 19:00.005
a series of random choices
to make.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.974
And even though they will be
completely random,

19:03.008 --> 19:07.346
I predict that the end result
will be that Penn and Teller

19:07.378 --> 19:09.548
meet once again.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.083
Penn,
the first choice is yours.

19:11.115 --> 19:13.417
On the board here, I have
five different locations:

19:13.451 --> 19:15.220
your house, a coffee shop,

19:15.253 --> 19:17.756
the movies, a library,
and a theater.

19:17.788 --> 19:19.892
I'd like you to pick
one of those locations.

19:19.924 --> 19:21.727
- A library.
- A library.

19:21.759 --> 19:24.663
We will put Penn
into the library.

19:24.695 --> 19:27.266
Teller the same thing for you.
I'll move you down the road,

19:27.298 --> 19:29.934
you just hold up your hand
when you want me to stop.

19:29.968 --> 19:33.739
Your house, a coffee shop,

19:33.771 --> 19:36.875
the movies, a library--

19:36.909 --> 19:38.176
you wanna stop in the library.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.145
So we have both Penn
and Teller in the library.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.681
They made the same decision.

19:42.713 --> 19:45.116
Perhaps it was always
meant to be.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.719
Now here's the fun thing.
In this folder here,

19:47.752 --> 19:50.489
I have five of
your key career events.

19:50.521 --> 19:52.223
I'm gonna read them out one
by one

19:52.257 --> 19:55.493
and I'd like you to rank them
between one and five.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.162
And we'll place one
in each spot

19:57.195 --> 19:59.530
until we fill up
all five spaces.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.933
Now one could be high
or five could be high.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.469
That's your choice.
I'm not gonna find out.

20:04.502 --> 20:06.904
And I'm even gonna give you the
opportunity to change your mind

20:06.939 --> 20:09.007
once you've seen
all five cards.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.143
So the first career event
is for you, Penn.

20:11.175 --> 20:13.979
It is graduating Clown School.

20:14.011 --> 20:16.414
Where should that go?
One, two, three, four or five?

20:16.448 --> 20:20.251
- Clown College, well,
the best of times,

20:20.285 --> 20:22.186
it was the worst of times.
[laughter]

20:22.221 --> 20:23.788
Let's put that at two.

20:23.821 --> 20:24.923
- That is a great choice.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.424
I have so many questions
right now,

20:26.458 --> 20:28.492
but we will leave that
to later.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.627
And Teller this one's for you.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.729
Of course,
we already mentioned it.

20:30.761 --> 20:32.730
It is teaching
high school Latin.

20:32.763 --> 20:36.201
Where would you rank that?
One, three, four or five?

20:36.234 --> 20:39.171
- Unus. Notice I speak Latin
to the only Latin teacher

20:39.203 --> 20:40.771
that won't correct
my pronunciation.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.241
[laughter]
This one goes here.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.210
Next one is for both of you.

20:45.243 --> 20:47.813
You both appeared on a TV show
early in your career

20:47.846 --> 20:49.080
called "Miami Vice."

20:49.114 --> 20:51.083
Now I have to admit
I haven't seen the show.

20:51.115 --> 20:53.585
I'm just hoping that your
Wikipedia page is accurate,

20:53.618 --> 20:55.487
but where should it go?
We have three, four or five.

20:55.519 --> 20:56.887
- Oh, dear.
We can change our minds?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.356
- Later on, you can change
your mind, I promise.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.226
- Is one low or high
in your mind, Teller?

21:01.259 --> 21:02.693
'Cause wherever it is,

21:02.728 --> 21:04.695
"Miami Vice"
needs to be the worst.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.464
[laughter]
- You know what?

21:06.498 --> 21:08.500
I'm gonna go and change this
right now.

21:08.532 --> 21:10.501
If you want,
I can swap teaching Latin

21:10.535 --> 21:11.869
and put it somewhere else.

21:11.903 --> 21:13.438
- Why don't you
slide them over,

21:13.471 --> 21:17.108
put "Miami Vice"
in the toilet at one?

21:17.142 --> 21:19.544
- "Miami Vice" at one.

21:19.577 --> 21:22.314
- 'Cause you spend six weeks
with Don Johnson,

21:22.346 --> 21:24.048
see how much
you wanna stay alive.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.884
[laughter]

21:26.917 --> 21:28.519
- Okay, we're almost there.

21:28.553 --> 21:33.157
These next one is your first
Broadway show back in--

21:33.191 --> 21:35.727
- Well, that was fabulous.
- This was back in 1987.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.729
You were referred to
as the bad boys of magic.

21:37.762 --> 21:39.431
- Yeah.
[laughter]

21:39.463 --> 21:40.699
I would say five on that.

21:40.731 --> 21:42.233
- Five.
- Let's do five on that.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.403
- A very understandable
career highlight.

21:44.435 --> 21:46.570
The next one
is my personal favorite,

21:46.605 --> 21:49.007
but I have to admit it hasn't
actually happened yet,

21:49.040 --> 21:51.042
but I'm hoping
it will after the show.

21:51.076 --> 21:52.510
- Nobel Prize.
- Almost.

21:52.544 --> 21:53.511
- Okay.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.047
- Equally as good
if not better.

21:55.079 --> 21:58.016
It is making me, Andi Gladwin,

21:58.049 --> 21:59.550
the third
Penn and Teller member.

21:59.584 --> 22:00.751
- I see, I see.
[laughter]

22:00.786 --> 22:03.622
- I have a name for us.
Penn Andi Teller.

22:03.654 --> 22:05.557
It's one extra letter. It's
like it's meant to be, fellas.

22:05.589 --> 22:07.526
We should do this.
- It's a very good point.

22:07.558 --> 22:09.528
- So that one right now
is gonna go in to four.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.796
I did say I would give you

22:10.828 --> 22:12.763
the opportunity
to change your mind.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.900
So are there any now that
you've seen every one of them

22:14.932 --> 22:17.769
that
you want me to switch about?

22:17.803 --> 22:20.238
- I think they're in pretty
good order right there myself.

22:20.271 --> 22:21.839
Do you want to change
something, Teller?

22:21.873 --> 22:24.776
Good. We are happy.
We will stand pat.

22:24.809 --> 22:26.345
- If you are happy,
I'm happy too.

22:26.377 --> 22:28.246
But there is one more
opportunity I wanna give you.

22:28.279 --> 22:30.781
You see,
the orientation of these cards

22:30.816 --> 22:33.451
is vitally important
to the outcome of this trick.

22:33.484 --> 22:36.688
So are there any that you would
like me to turn upside down?

22:36.721 --> 22:38.890
- Please turn "Miami Vice"
upside down.

22:38.923 --> 22:40.759
- I'm sensing bad times.
[laughter]

22:40.791 --> 22:42.527
- Let's hope voodoo works
with that rat bastard.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.862
[laughter]

22:43.894 --> 22:47.265
- Any more before we continue?
- No. That's good.

22:47.298 --> 22:49.667
- Well, now I get to tell you
what all of this is about.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.971
You see, on the other side
of these cards is a maze.

22:53.003 --> 22:56.375
And it's a maze built entirely
by the decisions

22:56.407 --> 22:59.076
that you have both made
from your career.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.780
And you'll notice it's a maze
with five stop points

23:02.814 --> 23:06.084
and five end points
on each card.

23:06.117 --> 23:08.787
Now Penn,
that day that you met Teller,

23:08.819 --> 23:10.821
if you'd have decided
to stay at home,

23:10.855 --> 23:12.457
let's look at
what would have happened.

23:12.490 --> 23:16.260
You see, you wouldn't have met
Teller as we follow along

23:16.294 --> 23:19.230
making every move
along you can see

23:19.263 --> 23:20.898
that you wouldn't have met
Teller that day.

23:20.932 --> 23:24.135
Instead, you have
ended up back home.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.903
It wouldn't have been
Penn and Teller,

23:25.936 --> 23:29.106
it would've been Penn
and some other fellow.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.777
Now there are
25 different start

23:31.809 --> 23:34.378
and end point combinations
on this board.

23:34.413 --> 23:39.017
If you multiply that by the 24
possible orders on the board

23:39.049 --> 23:40.419
and then multiply that again

23:40.451 --> 23:43.355
by the 16 possible
order combinations,

23:43.387 --> 23:46.590
and there is a one
in 9,600 chance

23:46.625 --> 23:48.826
that you two
would create this maze.

23:48.859 --> 23:51.462
Now either my entire
"Fool Us" experience

23:51.496 --> 23:53.698
is based entirely on luck

23:53.731 --> 23:56.801
or maybe, just maybe,

23:56.835 --> 23:59.304
Penn and Teller were
always meant to be.

23:59.336 --> 24:00.505
Let's take a look.

24:00.538 --> 24:03.909
Penn, you decided
to start at the library.

24:03.942 --> 24:08.046
If I follow along making
all of the twists and turns

24:08.078 --> 24:11.316
based on all of the twists
and turns of your career,

24:11.348 --> 24:13.718
you will see that
the end result

24:13.751 --> 24:17.622
is that Penn and Teller
meet once again.

24:17.655 --> 24:22.426
It's like it was meant to be.
[cheers and applause]

24:22.461 --> 24:26.932
- Andi Gladwin.

24:26.964 --> 24:30.067
Wow.
That was amazing.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.569
- Yes.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.971
- You must be
incredibly good at math.

24:34.005 --> 24:35.840
- I'm a secret nerd.

24:35.874 --> 24:38.442
- And you're incredibly good
at magic.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.810
- Well, thank you.
That's very kind.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.614
But it's fun to combine
all of my interests.

24:42.646 --> 24:44.182
I used to be
a computer programmer.

24:44.215 --> 24:45.584
That's a little bit of that.
There's math.

24:45.616 --> 24:47.853
There's everything.
This is a fun trick to work on.

24:47.885 --> 24:50.288
- Wow.
So what is this trick tell us?

24:50.322 --> 24:52.656
Is life fate or happenstance?

24:52.691 --> 24:55.727
- Well, we can never calculate
the odds of meeting the people

24:55.759 --> 24:58.497
that we ended up meeting
and that was my starting point.

24:58.529 --> 25:01.165
Thinking, "What would the odds
of Penn meeting Teller?"

25:01.199 --> 25:02.834
- So if this trick didn't work

25:02.867 --> 25:06.738
and Penn wound up in the coffee
shop, would we all just vanish?

25:06.770 --> 25:10.375
- We probably will just enjoy
coffee right now, I think.

25:10.407 --> 25:12.109
- Do your business
and your performances

25:12.143 --> 25:13.310
compete for attention?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.012
- No, they share attention,
actually,

25:15.046 --> 25:18.016
because I get to use
my experience as a performer

25:18.048 --> 25:19.917
and then I get
to perform the tricks

25:19.951 --> 25:21.586
and make sure
that they are really great.

25:21.619 --> 25:23.821
- Andi,
I know they were amazed.

25:23.855 --> 25:28.425
But let's see if Penn
and Teller are still puzzled.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.063
- Hey, Andi, boy, you just come
up with the greatest stuff.

25:32.096 --> 25:34.566
Teller especially
goes to Vanishing Inc.,

25:34.598 --> 25:37.969
which is your company and buys
tricks from you all the time.

25:38.002 --> 25:39.703
You just make up
the greatest stuff.

25:39.738 --> 25:44.308
And we are so honored because
did you make this up for us?

25:44.342 --> 25:45.743
- Just for you guys.
- Wow.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.711
- This is the only time
you're performing it?

25:47.746 --> 25:49.146
- First and last time.

25:49.180 --> 25:52.584
- Wow. We're amazed and honored
and thankful of that.

25:52.616 --> 25:56.288
You know, as you probably
noticed, we were drawing things

25:56.320 --> 25:59.758
and we were looking at this,
we were tracing it in our minds

25:59.790 --> 26:01.826
and turning stuff
and figuring it out.

26:01.859 --> 26:03.127
I gotta to tell ya,

26:03.161 --> 26:07.566
of all the people we've busted
on "Fool Us,"

26:07.598 --> 26:10.201
I don't think there's anybody
we've busted more.

26:10.234 --> 26:13.471
I mean, I think we figured out
more in this trick

26:13.505 --> 26:15.673
than any other trick
we've ever figured out.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.576
We were so proud of ourselves.

26:17.608 --> 26:20.478
We figured out
like four steps of this

26:20.511 --> 26:23.280
and we're just doing math
like crazy.

26:23.315 --> 26:26.351
We're feeling really good
about ourselves. Really great.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.118
And we were feeling
a little smug

26:28.153 --> 26:30.989
and then we ran through
all the stuff we worked out,

26:31.021 --> 26:33.924
which I will repeat is more
than we've ever worked out

26:33.959 --> 26:38.163
on anyone else and realized
it still wasn't enough.

26:38.195 --> 26:39.964
We still don't have everything.

26:39.998 --> 26:42.567
You fooled us.
It's as simple as that.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.868
[cheers and applause]
- You fooled them!

26:44.903 --> 26:48.006
- We don't have enough.
We have so much of it.

26:48.038 --> 26:52.042
We figured so much of it,
but not enough.

26:52.076 --> 26:53.612
- Now you look amazed.

26:53.644 --> 26:55.779
- Thank you so much.
[cheers and applause]

26:55.814 --> 26:58.016
Thank you so much.
- Yay!

26:58.048 --> 27:00.218
Congratulations, Andi.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.619
- And thanks for working
that out for us.

27:01.653 --> 27:02.787
It was so great.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.957
- Andi Gladwin!
[cheers and applause]

27:05.990 --> 27:09.461
Behold, a new Fooler.
And we're not done yet.

27:09.493 --> 27:14.432
Penn and Teller take on
more magicians when we return.

27:22.906 --> 27:25.644
[cheers and applause]

27:25.676 --> 27:27.112
- You though we vanished,

27:27.144 --> 27:30.781
but we return just in time
to show you our next magician.

27:32.983 --> 27:36.054
- Comedy has always been
a big part of my repertoire.

27:36.086 --> 27:38.522
Well, it had to be
because of my name.

27:38.556 --> 27:40.157
I call myself Topas.

27:40.191 --> 27:42.894
My real name
is Tomas Froschler,

27:42.926 --> 27:46.364
which in German means Thomas,
the little frog.

27:46.397 --> 27:47.531
[frog croaks]

27:47.565 --> 27:48.767
With a name like that,

27:48.799 --> 27:50.101
you better learn
to laugh at yourself,

27:50.134 --> 27:52.604
so I do,
even when I'm being Topas.

27:52.636 --> 27:54.172
Last time I was on the show,

27:54.204 --> 27:56.307
I did one of the tricks
I'm most known for

27:56.340 --> 27:58.576
and in fact, I've done
for more than a decade.

27:58.609 --> 28:02.212
Tonight, I'm bringing
Penn and Teller a surprise.

28:02.247 --> 28:04.682
I'm doing a brand-new effect.

28:04.715 --> 28:06.317
No one has ever
seen it before.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.586
Maybe I can fool Penn
and Teller for this reason.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.690
Performing a new trick
on "Fool Us"

28:11.722 --> 28:14.125
is like introducing a baby
to the world.

28:14.159 --> 28:18.496
So please, if you would,
wish me luck.

28:18.529 --> 28:21.566
[cheers and applause]

28:23.300 --> 28:28.673
- Joining us once again,
German master magician, Topas.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.742
[cheers and applause]

28:38.182 --> 28:41.152
[dramatic pop music]

28:41.185 --> 28:48.226
â™ª â™ª

28:58.502 --> 29:00.704
[audience murmurs]

29:00.739 --> 29:07.778
â™ª â™ª

29:44.382 --> 29:46.451
- â™ª A little less of me â™ª

29:46.483 --> 29:49.319
â™ª Where is myself? â™ª

29:49.354 --> 29:51.388
â™ª Keep on running,
I look stunning â™ª

29:51.422 --> 29:53.157
â™ª And feel free â™ª

29:53.191 --> 29:55.425
â™ª A little less of me â™ª

29:55.460 --> 29:58.163
â™ª Where is myself? â™ª

29:58.195 --> 30:00.365
â™ª All this hustle
just for muscle â™ª

30:00.397 --> 30:03.233
â™ª I'll be less of me â™ª

30:03.268 --> 30:08.038
â™ª â™ª

30:08.071 --> 30:09.707
[audience murmuring]

30:09.740 --> 30:15.779
â™ª â™ª

30:35.266 --> 30:37.634
[applause]

30:37.669 --> 30:43.708
â™ª â™ª

30:55.987 --> 30:58.088
â™ª A little less of me â™ª

30:58.122 --> 31:00.825
â™ª Where is myself? â™ª

31:00.858 --> 31:03.027
â™ª All this hustle
just for muscle â™ª

31:03.060 --> 31:06.029
â™ª I'll be less of me â™ª

31:06.064 --> 31:07.798
â™ª â™ª

31:07.832 --> 31:09.567
[applause]

31:09.601 --> 31:14.404
â™ª â™ª

31:14.439 --> 31:17.474
[cheers and applause]

31:18.609 --> 31:21.813
- Topas.

31:21.846 --> 31:24.048
Hello.
- Hi.

31:24.082 --> 31:27.018
- So Topas, this is
the premiere of this trick.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.653
- Yes, that's true.

31:28.685 --> 31:31.221
I've never shown it
anywhere else.

31:31.256 --> 31:32.356
- So you brought your baby

31:32.390 --> 31:33.458
and you
just threw it to the wolves?

31:33.490 --> 31:34.625
[laughter]

31:34.659 --> 31:37.261
- Well, they're
very nice wolves.

31:37.295 --> 31:40.097
So I feel I'm
in the best place possible

31:40.131 --> 31:42.432
to introduce it to the world.
- Aw.

31:42.467 --> 31:45.336
So for your whole career,
you always create new tricks?

31:45.369 --> 31:48.373
- Yeah. I like to be
an author of magic

31:48.405 --> 31:50.741
and I don't think
there has been

31:50.775 --> 31:54.645
any magic been done in the past
on a treadmill before.

31:54.679 --> 31:59.384
So you know, we had to come up
with new principles

31:59.416 --> 32:03.855
for floating while you jog.
[laughter]

32:03.887 --> 32:05.390
- When you develop a new trick,

32:05.423 --> 32:07.858
do you start with the ending
or the beginning,

32:07.892 --> 32:11.828
or do you sort of see
the whole thing as a package?

32:11.863 --> 32:16.366
- It's not the ending, usually.
It's this one special moment

32:16.401 --> 32:20.171
that I have never seen before
and that I want to create.

32:20.203 --> 32:24.342
In this case,
I saw moving in slow motion,

32:24.375 --> 32:28.613
jogging in slow motion.
That was, you know,

32:28.645 --> 32:30.748
the dream, the vision
I had for this piece.

32:30.781 --> 32:33.984
- All right, let's see if you
and your magical treadmill

32:34.018 --> 32:36.921
will walk away with a trophy.

32:36.954 --> 32:39.324
- Oh, Topas, as soon as we saw
your name, you know,

32:39.356 --> 32:42.527
Teller said this guy's
a great inventor

32:42.559 --> 32:45.863
and also your stuff
is so meticulous.

32:45.896 --> 32:47.464
I don't think we have anybody
on the show

32:47.498 --> 32:48.900
that works harder than you.

32:48.932 --> 32:52.470
And this is also
physically so demanding.

32:52.502 --> 32:54.471
Such an amazing routine.

32:54.505 --> 32:57.909
And having that treadmill,
you know, it's a magical thing.

32:57.942 --> 33:00.178
It's a magical thing
to be able to move.

33:00.211 --> 33:02.814
And it's kind of like
your magic wand in this.

33:02.846 --> 33:08.452
It's just so good walking
around at the beginning,

33:08.486 --> 33:12.123
behind the thing which is maybe
not much to an audience.

33:12.155 --> 33:13.790
It's a big deal to us.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.861
You know, they say gambling
when they show a sleight,

33:16.894 --> 33:19.497
how to get into it, how do you
get out of it, you know.

33:19.529 --> 33:22.467
And that's really hard
on this trick.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.135
You get into it, no sweat,
you know.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.172
Wipe the sweat from your brow
no big deal, you're in.

33:28.205 --> 33:33.044
And a lot of people think that,
you know, levitations

33:33.076 --> 33:37.515
and moving around like that
is kind of old school.

33:37.548 --> 33:40.218
But to us, it was really hip.
It was really good.

33:40.250 --> 33:44.122
But I think we have a pretty
good idea how you did it

33:44.154 --> 33:46.723
and almost wish we didn't
because

33:46.758 --> 33:51.061
this is the top tier for beauty
and for entertainment

33:51.095 --> 33:54.198
and just for plain good,
hard work

33:54.231 --> 33:56.433
and thinking magically.
Just beautiful.

33:56.467 --> 33:58.001
- So Topas,

33:58.036 --> 34:03.240
do they know the tricks
to your magical treadmill?

34:03.273 --> 34:06.810
- You know, maybe you have not
heard everything I have heard,

34:06.844 --> 34:09.179
but I think they have
a very good idea.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.847
[laughter]

34:10.882 --> 34:13.384
- Well, thank you so much.
Topas.

34:13.418 --> 34:18.556
- So good. So good, Topas.
[cheers and applause]

34:18.588 --> 34:21.659
- I bet you have time
for one more trick.

34:21.692 --> 34:23.260
And just to sweeten the pot,

34:23.293 --> 34:26.463
I'll tell you it's a trick
by Penn and Teller.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.365
See you right after the break.

34:28.398 --> 34:30.902
[cheers and applause]

34:38.443 --> 34:40.978
[cheers and applause]

34:41.012 --> 34:44.849
Closing out tonight's show
along with author and comedian,

34:44.882 --> 34:47.918
Heather McDonald,
are the legends themselves,

34:47.952 --> 34:51.489
Penn and Teller.
[cheers and applause]

34:51.521 --> 34:53.123
- Hey, Heather,
how you doing?

34:53.157 --> 34:54.891
- I'm doing great.
How are you guys?

34:54.925 --> 34:56.693
- Very well, thank you.
I think we were--

34:56.726 --> 34:59.030
weren't we on Chelsea
together once, I think?

34:59.063 --> 35:01.364
- I'm sure we were.
- I'm sure. We had to be.

35:01.398 --> 35:03.166
So we sent you a bunch of M&Ms.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.103
Did you get a bunch of bags?
- Yes, I do. I have a lot.

35:05.135 --> 35:06.137
- We gave you a zillion bags.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.271
Now, Heather, these are--

35:08.306 --> 35:11.809
they're packaged by weight
and by percentage.

35:11.842 --> 35:14.411
So you never know how many
of each color you're gonna get.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.780
So pick any one of the bags
you have there

35:16.813 --> 35:19.851
and just open it up

35:19.884 --> 35:22.452
and dump them carefully
onto the plate there, Heather.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.155
If you would--
don't open yours, Teller.

35:24.188 --> 35:27.190
That--don't open yours.
Just dump them out there.

35:27.224 --> 35:29.393
- Hold on.
- Okay, good.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.862
- This is the hard part
of the trick, Heather.

35:31.896 --> 35:36.634
- Okay. So, pour them out.
Okay.

35:36.666 --> 35:39.804
- I have mostly brown
and mostly orange.

35:39.836 --> 35:42.940
There are fewer yellows,
greens and blues,

35:42.974 --> 35:45.976
but let's just check yellows.

35:46.010 --> 35:48.045
How many yellows
do you have there, Heather?

35:48.079 --> 35:53.451
I have one, two,
three, four, five, six.

35:53.483 --> 35:57.054
I have six yellows.
How many yellows do you have?

35:57.088 --> 35:59.724
- I have 12.
- Yeah, so you have many more

35:59.757 --> 36:01.759
yellows than I do.
And you'll see.

36:01.791 --> 36:04.661
What do you have the fewest of,
does it seem there, Heather?

36:04.695 --> 36:07.130
- I feel like
I have the fewest reds.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.934
I have one, two, three,
four, five reds.

36:09.967 --> 36:14.371
- Yeah. I have two, two, four,
I have six reds.

36:14.405 --> 36:16.440
But you see there's
different numbers there.

36:16.474 --> 36:20.110
Now Heather, you can either
keep the bag you've got there

36:20.143 --> 36:21.344
or you can change
for another bag

36:21.378 --> 36:22.679
just dump those out.

36:22.713 --> 36:25.148
You happy with those
or you wanna change?

36:25.182 --> 36:26.516
- I guess I'm happy with these,
I don't know.

36:26.550 --> 36:28.119
- Okay, good.
Here's what we're gonna do,

36:28.152 --> 36:30.487
mix them up so that all the
colors have different there.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.956
Okay. And just
for the trick purposes,

36:32.989 --> 36:34.257
let's get rid
of the brown ones.

36:34.291 --> 36:36.860
Pick out the brown ones.
Count them as you do one,

36:36.893 --> 36:41.565
two, three, four, five,
six, seven,

36:41.599 --> 36:43.534
eight, nine.

36:43.568 --> 36:44.969
- Seven.

36:45.001 --> 36:47.371
- Nine, ten.
I have ten brown ones.

36:47.405 --> 36:50.240
So Heather, eat the brown ones.
Get rid of the brown ones.

36:50.273 --> 36:53.311
I'll feed mine to Teller.
Eat all the brown ones.

36:53.344 --> 36:54.545
- Okay.
All right, hold on.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.681
- Brown ones are gone.
- Okay.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.884
- Now the next most
are oranges.

36:59.916 --> 37:02.519
Count out your oranges.
You're gonna eat those, too.

37:02.552 --> 37:05.856
Two, four, six, eight,

37:05.889 --> 37:09.793
ten, twelve.

37:09.827 --> 37:11.494
I have 13 oranges.

37:11.528 --> 37:13.431
How many oranges do you have,
Heather?

37:13.463 --> 37:16.067
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight,

37:16.099 --> 37:18.168
nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

37:18.202 --> 37:19.804
- 12.
And I have 13.

37:19.836 --> 37:21.304
Eat them, Heather.
Eat them.

37:21.338 --> 37:22.907
[laughter]

37:22.940 --> 37:25.610
Eat yours. Here's another one.
Eat your oranges.

37:25.643 --> 37:27.177
All right, good eating.

37:27.210 --> 37:29.847
Now all you've got left here

37:29.880 --> 37:33.583
are blues,
yellows, reds, and greens.

37:33.617 --> 37:36.219
So mix them up good and then
close your eyes, Heather.

37:36.253 --> 37:39.824
Close your eyes. Reach in
and pull out one color.

37:41.626 --> 37:43.594
What color you got there?

37:43.628 --> 37:44.961
- Blue.
- Blue.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.963
Count the blues and eat them.

37:52.103 --> 37:55.773
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

37:55.806 --> 38:00.344
- I got 16 blues. 16 blues.
Eat 'em, Heather.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.947
Teller eats them so much faster
than you do.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.048
[laughter]

38:05.081 --> 38:07.684
Once again, Heather,
close your eyes.

38:07.717 --> 38:09.286
Reach in, pull out a color.

38:12.255 --> 38:14.257
What color you got there,
Heather?

38:14.291 --> 38:15.559
- Red.
- Red.

38:15.592 --> 38:16.860
I got--eat the reds.

38:16.893 --> 38:22.099
Two, four, I got six reds.
How many you got?

38:22.132 --> 38:23.534
- I only have five.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.936
- Only have five.
Eat them, Heather, eat them.

38:27.538 --> 38:31.108
Now, all you've got left
is yellow and green.

38:31.141 --> 38:32.909
- Okay.
- Now, you tell me.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.577
This is totally your choice.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.213
One color you're gonna eat

38:36.246 --> 38:38.349
and the other color
is gonna be our trick.

38:38.382 --> 38:39.983
Which color do you wanna eat?

38:40.016 --> 38:42.286
Which color do you want
for our trick?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.487
- I'll eat the green.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.856
- So how many greens
are you eating?

38:45.889 --> 38:48.492
- Two, four, six, eight,
ten, eleven.

38:48.525 --> 38:51.262
- And how many yellows
do you have left?

38:51.295 --> 38:56.500
- I have 12.
- You have 12 yellows left.

38:56.534 --> 39:00.971
Eat the greens.
And you have 12 yellows left.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.306
Now you notice, Heather,
from the very beginning,

39:03.340 --> 39:06.043
Teller has been holding
one bag of M&M's.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.411
I opened up mine,
we ate the whole bag.

39:08.445 --> 39:09.713
You ate your whole bag.

39:09.746 --> 39:13.684
He has one bag in plain sight
the whole time.

39:13.717 --> 39:17.320
In that bag, Heather?
- Yes.

39:17.355 --> 39:21.092
- There are

39:21.125 --> 39:24.594
one, two, three,
four, five, six,

39:24.628 --> 39:28.199
seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve.

39:28.231 --> 39:29.666
[audience exclaiming]

39:29.699 --> 39:33.336
12 yellows and nothing else
in the bag, Heather.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.172
Thanks a lot for doing
the trick with us, Heather.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.340
- My kids will enjoy that.
Thank you so much.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.775
That was real fun.

39:38.809 --> 39:42.413
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, wow.

39:42.445 --> 39:45.248
That is all the tricks
and treats

39:45.282 --> 39:47.150
we could fit
into tonight's show.

39:47.184 --> 39:50.054
We'll see you next time
with another sweet episode

39:50.086 --> 39:51.054
of "Fool Us."

39:51.088 --> 39:52.822
Goodnight.
Yum.

39:52.856 --> 39:55.893
[cheers and applause]
