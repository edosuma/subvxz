01:52.760 --> 01:55.080
[laughs] That is embarrassing!

01:55.120 --> 01:57.080
- Yeah, I'm always
- doing stuff like that.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.600
Me too.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.240
Something funny?

02:00.280 --> 02:02.000
Sorry to break up your dorkfest,

02:02.040 --> 02:04.000
- but I want to talk to Paula.
- Come.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.360
I'm not sure about Paula.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.880
[Mia] We've been getting closer,

02:13.920 --> 02:15.460
but I don't know

02:15.461 --> 02:17.000
how trustworthy she is.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.800
That Violetta is bad news.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.120
I just wonder

02:21.121 --> 02:22.400
if she's really on our team.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.920
Yeah: "Team Terrific."

02:23.960 --> 02:25.720
- Can I get a
- "whoa, Team Terrific!"?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.720
Hey, guys!

02:29.760 --> 02:31.400
Wait up!

02:31.440 --> 02:33.080
What did Violetta want?

02:33.120 --> 02:35.080
Nothing...

02:35.081 --> 02:37.040
just one of Violetta's jokes.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.440
Howttthhh it goin', Mia?

02:50.480 --> 02:52.060
- Huh?

02:52.061 --> 02:53.640
- Howth that lithp treatin' ya?

02:53.680 --> 02:55.120
What are you talking about?

02:55.160 --> 02:56.840
I don't have a lisp.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.240
You sure about that?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.880
Rumour has it you used to go

02:59.920 --> 03:01.920
to a thpeech therapitht?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.020
Vincent, you never told anyone

03:12.021 --> 03:13.440
about my lisp, did you?

03:13.480 --> 03:14.720
Are you kidding?

03:14.760 --> 03:15.960
I have a great respect

03:16.000 --> 03:17.560
for people with a "LISP".

03:17.600 --> 03:18.760
Oh. Right.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.960
Well, if it wasn't me

03:22.000 --> 03:24.040
it must have been...

03:24.080 --> 03:25.680
Paula! I knew it!

03:25.720 --> 03:27.480
- She's still doing
- Violetta's dirty work.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.660
Well, I'm going to give her

03:28.661 --> 03:29.800
a piece of my mind!

03:29.840 --> 03:31.280
Go Team Terrific!

03:33.320 --> 03:34.360
Hi.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.296
- Not that I really care,
- but why are you spreading gossip

03:38.320 --> 03:39.760
About me and my lisp?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.080
Is that your idea of funny?

03:42.520 --> 03:44.320
- You really think
- I would do that?!

03:44.360 --> 03:46.040
- I don't know.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.720
- Well, I wouldn't, okay?

03:47.760 --> 03:50.560
We're... really good friends!

03:50.600 --> 03:52.080
Aren't we?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.360
Good friends,

03:53.400 --> 03:54.880
kinda like you and Violetta?

03:54.920 --> 03:58.280
Violetta's very popular, I know.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.200
But... you're really nice to me.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.880
And we get along so well.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.680
How do I know I can trust you?

04:05.720 --> 04:07.600
- I guess you're going to
- make me prove it?

04:08.760 --> 04:10.400
Fine, I will.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.520
I'll get to

04:11.521 --> 04:12.601
the bottom of this somehow!

04:45.600 --> 04:47.840
Hi Mia. Say your password.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.120
"A treasure now

04:49.121 --> 04:50.360
and then betrays,

04:50.400 --> 04:51.720
Seek the ferns

04:51.721 --> 04:53.040
where the young one plays."

05:05.600 --> 05:08.360
[screams]

05:10.000 --> 05:11.160
[grunts]

05:11.200 --> 05:12.600
- Oops!
- [Yuko] Mia!

05:14.440 --> 05:15.500
- Are you alright?

05:15.501 --> 05:16.560
- I'm fine thanks.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.480
Just the usual bruised ego.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.480
- [neighs]
- Onchao!

05:20.520 --> 05:21.780
Nice to see you've mastered

05:21.781 --> 05:23.040
the art of landing...

05:23.080 --> 05:24.580
right on top of my best

05:24.581 --> 05:26.080
sand castle ever.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.020
Sorry. The tide would have

05:28.021 --> 05:29.920
washed it away eventually,

05:26.120 --> 05:29.920
right?

05:29.960 --> 05:31.800
- I made this castle
- when I was five,

05:31.840 --> 05:33.496
- And the tide has never
- come up this far.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.080
[Mia] How can that be?

05:35.120 --> 05:36.776
- There's a tide pool right here,
- full of...

05:36.800 --> 05:38.480
[Mo] Mia, no!

05:38.520 --> 05:40.520
Hey! What was that all about?!

05:40.560 --> 05:41.920
Don't you know a Crystal Basin

05:41.921 --> 05:43.280
when you see one?

05:43.320 --> 05:44.800
[Mia] Um, no.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.400
What's a Crystal Basin?

05:47.440 --> 05:48.760
Check it out.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.400
I don't think

05:54.401 --> 05:55.560
you'd like being glass.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.560
I... I didn't know.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.760
Now you do.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.120
[hums]

06:05.640 --> 06:07.200
Hey, if Yuko played around here

06:07.201 --> 06:08.760
when she was little,

06:08.800 --> 06:10.360
that fits with the oracle:

06:10.400 --> 06:11.500
"A treasure now

06:11.501 --> 06:12.600
and then betrays.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.600
Seek the ferns

06:14.601 --> 06:16.560
where the young one plays."

06:16.600 --> 06:18.080
Well? There could be

06:18.081 --> 06:19.560
a Trumptus piece nearby!

06:19.600 --> 06:21.520
- Do you see any ferns
- around here?

06:21.560 --> 06:22.700
And who knows

06:22.701 --> 06:23.840
if the oracle meant Yuko.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.300
Let's just find

06:25.301 --> 06:26.720
the paisley grass first.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.760
What's paisley grass again?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.600
- The Queen has come down
- with Gryphon Flu.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.400
Uh... Gryphon Flu?

06:32.440 --> 06:34.040
You know... Gryphon Flu.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.600
Green blotches,

06:35.601 --> 06:37.120
stuffy nose, the shakes.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.800
Cured by Paisley Grass.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.960
You've never heard of that?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.680
Of course I have!

06:43.720 --> 06:45.240
I just thought you said...

06:45.280 --> 06:47.640
Flyphon... Gru.

06:47.680 --> 06:48.880
Which, you know,

06:48.881 --> 06:50.080
isn't even words.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.760
Pheew!

06:56.920 --> 06:58.300
I thought for sure Onchao would

06:58.301 --> 06:59.680
lead us to some paisley grass.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.320
Unicorns love that stuff.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.060
You know what paisley

07:04.061 --> 07:05.160
grass looks like, right?

07:05.200 --> 07:06.540
No! But I haven't lived here

07:06.541 --> 07:07.880
my whole life.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.960
Don't touch those!

07:14.000 --> 07:15.160
Why not?!

07:17.240 --> 07:18.280
AH-CHOO!

07:18.320 --> 07:19.880
[Mo] That's why.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.680
- Look, maybe you
- should just hang back

07:21.720 --> 07:23.240
- And let us do
- the search for now.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.960
You guys don't want me around?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.520
Of course we do!

07:26.560 --> 07:28.200
- It's just that we really
- need to find

07:28.240 --> 07:29.760
That paisley grass fast...

07:29.800 --> 07:31.040
And I'm holding you back

07:31.080 --> 07:32.360
because I don't know anything?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.120
Fine. Find it yourself.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.720
- [sighs]

07:38.721 --> 07:39.840
- What did you say?

07:39.880 --> 07:41.240
I don't know. Who knows what's

07:41.241 --> 07:42.600
going to upset a girl?

07:42.640 --> 07:44.200
They don't make any sense.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.680
Oh, boys...

07:46.720 --> 07:48.000
What did I say?!

07:50.320 --> 07:52.480
Paisley grass! Gryphon flu!

07:52.520 --> 07:54.280
How would I know that stuff?!

07:54.320 --> 07:55.680
[neighs]

07:56.560 --> 07:58.160
[Mia] Polytheus!

07:58.200 --> 08:00.680
Ah... it's you!

08:00.720 --> 08:03.080
Welcome to my humble shop,

08:03.120 --> 08:05.140
Crazy Polytheus's Cavalcade

08:05.141 --> 08:07.160
of Curios and Collectibles!

08:07.200 --> 08:08.640
[chuckles]

08:08.680 --> 08:10.760
And hello again to you,

08:10.800 --> 08:12.760
little unicorn friend.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.440
What are you doing here?

08:14.480 --> 08:16.880
Why, selling antiques, doodads,

08:16.920 --> 08:18.520
novelties and all manner

08:18.521 --> 08:20.120
of filigreed frippery!

08:20.160 --> 08:21.680
To only the most discerning

08:21.681 --> 08:23.200
customers, of course.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.760
And anyone dumb

08:25.761 --> 08:26.800
enough to trust you.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.660
Oh my dear,

08:28.661 --> 08:30.480
I am deeply offended.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.440
- Then I presume you
- wouldn't be interested

08:32.480 --> 08:34.200
In this rare and

08:34.201 --> 08:35.919
exquisite objet d'art.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.400
It's a Tell-All LANTERN.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.980
But if you don't trust me,

08:40.981 --> 08:42.520
that's fine.

08:42.559 --> 08:45.760
What's a Tell-All LANTERN?

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
This little wonder

08:46.801 --> 08:47.801
of the world can answer

08:47.840 --> 08:49.600
any question of its owner.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.400
[snorts]

08:51.440 --> 08:52.960
Onchao, stop.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.240
[Polytheus] Here's my proposal.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.320
Because I like you...

08:56.360 --> 08:57.900
I offer you a

08:57.901 --> 08:59.440
"try before you buy" plan.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.580
You become the lantern's

09:01.581 --> 09:03.680
rightful owner until sundown,

09:03.720 --> 09:05.500
at which time you either

09:05.501 --> 09:07.280
pay for it, or you give it back.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.420
- What's the catch?

09:08.421 --> 09:09.520
- No catch.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.120
I swear on

09:11.121 --> 09:12.680
the Iridescent Dringsills.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.160
What's an Iridescent Dringsill?

09:15.200 --> 09:17.720
I don't know. I just made it up.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.540
With one of these,

09:19.541 --> 09:21.320
you'd know that.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.960
I hereby transfer ownership

09:22.961 --> 09:24.560
to you.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.840
You shall not be disappointed.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.880
Remember...

09:31.881 --> 09:33.320
you have only until sundown!

09:35.600 --> 09:37.200
[laughs evilly]

09:39.600 --> 09:41.040
I really need your help.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.160
I'm sick of looking dumb.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.080
- [Mo] There's not
- one blade of paisley grass

09:45.120 --> 09:46.480
Anywhere around here.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.240
This is taking so long,

09:48.280 --> 09:50.176
- we could have planted some
- and had it grow by now.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.600
So where else do we look?

09:53.920 --> 09:56.680
Try the... Diablo Backwoods?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.440
Pretty doubtful.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.600
And how would you know

09:59.601 --> 10:00.720
about Diablo Backwoods?

10:00.760 --> 10:02.400
I do know some things.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.200
- Hey, where'd you
- get the lantern?

10:04.240 --> 10:05.440
Oh, just picked it up down

10:05.441 --> 10:06.640
by the beach.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.740
It could come in handy.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.800
We always seem to wind up

10:08.840 --> 10:10.440
someplace dark.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.940
Alright, we'll try

10:11.941 --> 10:13.400
the Diablo Backwoods.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.780
There can't be

10:14.781 --> 10:16.120
any less paisley grass there.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.200
[Mia] Great!

10:18.640 --> 10:20.920
Um... it's that way.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.840
Oh, uh, I knew that.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.000
I... just thought

10:24.001 --> 10:25.120
we'd take the scenic route.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.720
[chuckles evilly]

10:31.760 --> 10:34.480
My client will be pleased.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.760
Here you go, Ziggo.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.760
A gourmet treat for you.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.320
[screeches]

10:55.320 --> 10:56.960
Precisely how I feel

10:56.961 --> 10:58.600
when I don't get what I want.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.000
[evil laughter]

11:03.040 --> 11:05.840
Greetings, Panthea.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.080
I don't like when you do that!

11:09.120 --> 11:10.400
Why can't you come in

11:10.401 --> 11:11.680
the gate like a normal person?

11:11.720 --> 11:13.040
But I bring good news

11:13.041 --> 11:14.360
your majesty.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.560
Your trap is planted.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.280
Oh, well then your surprise

11:18.281 --> 11:19.960
visit is most welcomed.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.100
Ugh... I almost

11:21.101 --> 11:22.200
feel guilty asking

11:22.240 --> 11:23.340
to be paid for

11:23.341 --> 11:24.440
such a simple deception,

11:24.480 --> 11:26.640
except that I never feel guilty

11:26.680 --> 11:28.440
about being paid for anything.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.600
Gargona already paid you!

11:30.640 --> 11:32.260
That was the purchase price

11:32.261 --> 11:33.880
of that creature,

11:33.920 --> 11:35.300
and the customized lamp

11:35.301 --> 11:36.680
to carry it in.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.040
Well actually...

11:38.041 --> 11:39.360
Hmmphh.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.780
I have not been paid

11:40.781 --> 11:42.160
for the effort

11:42.200 --> 11:43.540
of luring that elf

11:43.541 --> 11:44.880
and her little

11:44.920 --> 11:46.900
single-horned friend

11:46.901 --> 11:48.880
into your trap.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.560
Ugggh... Take it, then!

11:51.600 --> 11:53.400
Oooh!

11:53.440 --> 11:56.040
Excellent. [laughs]

11:56.080 --> 11:57.380
Oh and be sure

11:57.381 --> 11:58.680
to tell your friends!

11:58.720 --> 12:00.100
Half off magic mirrors

12:00.101 --> 12:01.480
every Tuesday!

12:01.520 --> 12:02.760
Ta-Ta.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.880
[Panthea] I'm never completely

12:05.881 --> 12:07.280
sure he's gone.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.580
Now then, Gargona...

12:08.581 --> 12:09.840
Polytheus did his part,

12:09.880 --> 12:12.120
so you better not mess up yours!

12:12.160 --> 12:14.000
I give you my word,

12:14.040 --> 12:15.360
the prey won't escape our trap

12:15.361 --> 12:16.680
this time!

12:18.400 --> 12:19.440
Meow.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.480
There there Ziggo.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.000
The nasty snake man is gone.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.000
[neighs]

12:31.040 --> 12:32.280
[Mia] Mhmm...

12:33.440 --> 12:35.000
Paisley grass, I presume.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.360
Whooo!

12:36.400 --> 12:37.800
Wow!

12:37.840 --> 12:39.720
Awesome guess that it'd be here!

12:39.760 --> 12:41.280
Um... thanks.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.880
Sure is nice to be the one

12:44.881 --> 12:46.320
with the answers for a change.

12:47.480 --> 12:48.680
Don't give me that look.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.200
I know what you're thinking.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.000
- It's not like
- I'm hurting anyone.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.016
- We never would have found
- this grass without...

12:54.040 --> 12:55.960
- [gasps]
- Wait!

12:56.000 --> 12:57.760
If it helped us find this grass,

12:57.761 --> 12:59.520
I wonder if...

12:59.560 --> 13:00.680
[whispers] Where can I find

13:00.681 --> 13:01.800
a piece of the Trumptus?

13:03.760 --> 13:05.520
I figured out the oracle!

13:05.560 --> 13:06.920
The Trumptus piece is

13:06.921 --> 13:08.280
in the Morbitus Badlands.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.140
Didn't the oracle say

13:10.141 --> 13:11.960
"where the young one plays"?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.720
Who plays in the Badlands?

13:13.760 --> 13:16.120
- We gotta get this paisley grass
- back to the Queen!

13:16.160 --> 13:17.920
She's waiting for us.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.160
- It's a piece of the Trumptus!
- She'll understand!

13:36.800 --> 13:38.080
[whistles]

13:38.120 --> 13:40.320
[Mo] Mia, Yuko!

13:40.360 --> 13:41.400
Dragons.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.520
[shrieking]

13:51.160 --> 13:52.520
We're safer on foot.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.680
[ghostly murmurs]

14:07.280 --> 14:09.640
Scary... not-scary.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.120
Could the choice be any easier?

14:12.160 --> 14:13.760
[Mo] That's what scares me.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.640
- [Yuko] What, is this way
- dangerous?

14:16.800 --> 14:18.720
[lantern whispers]

14:18.760 --> 14:21.600
Pitfalls. Snares. Cages.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.120
This road is full of them.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.000
And you know this... how?

14:25.040 --> 14:26.300
Your long experience

14:26.301 --> 14:27.560
as a tracker?

14:28.440 --> 14:29.600
Ugh!

14:31.880 --> 14:32.920
[grunts]

14:34.640 --> 14:35.680
[grunts]

14:41.720 --> 14:43.640
Wow, that's a no go.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.200
Good call Mia.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.920
How did you know about all this?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.560
I pick things up here and there.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.240
[snorts]

15:12.000 --> 15:13.280
Why do you keep looking at

15:13.281 --> 15:14.560
that old lantern?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.360
- [Gargona] Yes!
- Gargona!

15:16.400 --> 15:17.600
Why don't you

15:17.601 --> 15:18.800
tell them the truth?

15:21.760 --> 15:23.120
[neighs]

15:24.640 --> 15:26.320
We're not scared of you!

15:26.360 --> 15:27.760
Yeah! Bring it on!

15:28.480 --> 15:29.600
[neigh]

15:29.640 --> 15:30.760
Onchao!

15:30.800 --> 15:32.080
Let him go!

15:33.760 --> 15:35.680
- Agh!
- Agh!

15:35.720 --> 15:36.800
- Ugh!

15:36.801 --> 15:37.880
- Ugh!

15:37.920 --> 15:39.440
Ugh!

15:40.920 --> 15:43.280
Ugh!

15:44.720 --> 15:45.960
[Gargona] Hahaha.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.680
What have we here?

15:49.880 --> 15:52.160
Your lovely antique treasure

15:52.200 --> 15:53.920
has betrayed you.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.600
[Mo] It's a flibber-nate?

15:56.640 --> 15:57.800
A flibber-nate?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.320
They lie to their owners.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.000
- Trick 'em and
- get 'em in trouble!

16:01.040 --> 16:02.920
- But it told the truth
- about the traps,

16:02.960 --> 16:04.640
And the paisley grass...!

16:04.680 --> 16:06.500
No, wait, we asked

16:06.501 --> 16:08.320
those questions, not you.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.720
A flibber-nate only

16:09.721 --> 16:11.080
lies to its owner.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.180
[Gargona] I knew sooner

16:12.181 --> 16:13.240
or later you'd ask it

16:13.280 --> 16:15.320
to lead you to something:

16:15.360 --> 16:17.960
whatever you elves look for.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.560
And I made sure

16:19.600 --> 16:22.200
the lantern had an answer ready!

16:22.240 --> 16:23.420
Mia, if you had told us

16:23.421 --> 16:24.600
the truth about that lantern,

16:24.640 --> 16:26.240
we could have warned you!

16:26.280 --> 16:28.160
- I... I just didn't
- want to look dumb.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.640
I'm so sorry!

16:29.680 --> 16:31.360
Oh, don't be glum.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.760
You'll love Panthea's dungeon.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.360
Fewer rats than you'd expect.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.620
[Mia] Great, the end

16:44.621 --> 16:45.880
of a perfect day.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.940
Oh, be quiet!

16:48.941 --> 16:50.120
Wait a second,

16:50.160 --> 16:51.820
Polytheus only loaned me

16:51.821 --> 16:53.480
the lantern until sundown.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.240
Gargona is the flibber-nate's

16:58.241 --> 16:59.880
actual owner!

16:59.920 --> 17:01.640
[gasps] Yuko, you said

17:01.641 --> 17:03.360
the flabber-nate will

16:59.920 --> 17:03.360
only lie to its owner,

17:03.400 --> 17:05.359
- right?
- Yeah. So?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.280
- So Gargona probably
- doesn't know

17:07.319 --> 17:08.780
That Polytheus only let me

17:08.781 --> 17:10.240
try out the lantern.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.040
Maybe she thinks I still own it!

17:12.079 --> 17:13.520
I have an idea.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.800
If we could just get out

17:14.800 --> 17:16.040
of these ropes.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.839
[gasps] Wait a second!

17:20.440 --> 17:22.200
Nice! I am so glad girls

17:22.201 --> 17:23.960
like to keep souvenirs!

17:29.400 --> 17:30.780
Let go of me, you ugly spawn

17:30.781 --> 17:32.160
of a sea serpent!

17:32.200 --> 17:33.960
- AHH!
- [Yuko] It would have to be

17:34.000 --> 17:35.400
A whole lot better looking

17:35.401 --> 17:36.800
to make it to "ugly"!

17:36.840 --> 17:37.880
- Ugh!

17:37.881 --> 17:38.920
- [Gargona] Hahaha.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.240
Panthea will be most pleased

17:41.280 --> 17:43.080
- to get her hands
- on this unicorn!

17:43.120 --> 17:44.160
[neighs]

17:44.200 --> 17:45.520
[Mia laughs]

17:45.560 --> 17:46.720
As if!

17:46.760 --> 17:48.120
We'll be the ones laughing

17:48.160 --> 17:49.800
when the Elf army gets here!

17:49.840 --> 17:51.480
Foolish girl!

17:51.520 --> 17:53.020
Still listening to your

17:53.021 --> 17:54.520
flibber-nate lantern?

17:54.560 --> 17:55.960
Why don't you ask it?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.920
It only lies to me, right?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.600
[Gargona] Insolent one!

18:00.640 --> 18:03.040
Don't try to bluff me!

18:03.080 --> 18:06.080
Is there an Elf army nearby?

18:07.040 --> 18:08.200
[whispers]

18:08.240 --> 18:10.000
How large?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.320
[whispers]

18:11.360 --> 18:13.480
Large enough to defeat us?!

18:13.520 --> 18:15.440
You lose, Gargona!

18:15.480 --> 18:17.000
Oh yeah?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.960
They'll have to catch us first!

18:19.000 --> 18:21.160
Sound the retreat!

18:21.200 --> 18:22.320
[blows horn]

18:24.040 --> 18:26.400
Oh, fools! Don't just run away!

18:26.440 --> 18:28.640
Bring the unicorn!

18:35.200 --> 18:37.000
That unicorn is priceless!

18:37.040 --> 18:38.700
Panthea will kill us all

18:38.701 --> 18:40.360
if we return without it!!

18:41.720 --> 18:42.800
[laughs]

18:42.840 --> 18:44.560
No! Stop!

18:47.600 --> 18:48.800
Waterglares!

18:48.840 --> 18:50.600
- Blasted Elves!
- Aaah!

18:56.640 --> 18:57.960
[neighs]

18:59.920 --> 19:00.960
[neighs]

19:05.560 --> 19:07.680
[Gargona] UUUUGGGGGGGHHH!!!!!!!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.780
Whew. I've never flown

19:22.781 --> 19:24.400
so fast in my life!

19:24.440 --> 19:26.160
Can we just take a break?

19:26.200 --> 19:28.560
- We have to get the Pisley Grass
- back to the palace

19:28.600 --> 19:29.840
Or the Queen will

19:29.841 --> 19:31.080
have my wings on a platter!

19:31.120 --> 19:33.080
- Let's go!
- Come on, Onchao!

19:33.120 --> 19:34.720
[Mia] You can play later.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.040
- [snorts]
- [Mia gasps]

19:36.080 --> 19:37.600
"Seek the ferns..."

19:37.640 --> 19:39.480
- [both] "where
- the young one plays!"

19:39.520 --> 19:42.040
Duh! Onchao's the "young one"!

19:46.160 --> 19:48.120
And here's the Trumptus piece!

19:56.360 --> 19:57.720
Ah!

19:57.760 --> 20:00.040
The best paisley grass tea

20:00.080 --> 20:01.400
I've ever had...

20:01.440 --> 20:02.840
thanks to you three!

20:02.880 --> 20:03.980
And another piece

20:03.981 --> 20:05.080
of the Trumptus.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.420
It draws closer to

20:06.421 --> 20:07.720
completion all the time.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.640
A productive day out, eh?

20:09.680 --> 20:11.320
No wonder you were gone so long.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.320
Yeah, um... that's my fault.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.880
I got a little lost.

20:14.920 --> 20:15.940
But these guys

20:15.941 --> 20:16.960
helped me find my way.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.280
[giggles]

20:24.360 --> 20:25.960
[Mo] Can you believe it?

20:25.961 --> 20:27.560
Only ten pieces to go.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.960
Uh oh. Battery.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.320
I gotta go.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.420
I'm sorry I led everyone

20:31.421 --> 20:32.480
on a wild goose chase

20:32.520 --> 20:33.960
just because I felt dumb.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.440
What's a "wild goose"?

20:36.480 --> 20:38.200
You've never heard of a goose?

20:38.240 --> 20:39.700
You guys have no idea

20:39.701 --> 20:41.160
how happy this makes me.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.360
- I'm not the only one
- who doesn't know everything.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.600
'Bye, everyone!

20:45.640 --> 20:48.360
Give Onchao a hug for me!

20:48.400 --> 20:49.920
Ugh! I should have asked her to

20:49.960 --> 20:51.160
bring us one of

20:51.161 --> 20:52.360
those "goose" things!

20:55.280 --> 20:57.480
Phew, that was a close one.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.560
- Vincent?!
- What are you doing here?

21:01.600 --> 21:02.760
Shh.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.640
Paula snuck me in.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.280
Paula...? Why?

21:08.320 --> 21:09.976
- Look, she just said
- you need to hide. Okay.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.060
Uhm... That's it!

21:11.061 --> 21:12.120
Quick, the closet!

21:12.160 --> 21:13.440
- O-okay, but...
- Go... Go!

21:15.000 --> 21:16.100
Oh, hush. I should

21:16.101 --> 21:17.200
probably be hiding too.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.600
Ha, ha!

21:22.640 --> 21:26.200
So funny how you nailed Mia!

21:26.240 --> 21:28.200
[Paula] And she was so niffed.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.680
[to herself] What?!

21:29.720 --> 21:31.600
- [Paula] How did you know
- about her lisp?

21:31.640 --> 21:35.480
I never even told you about it!

21:35.520 --> 21:37.520
Mhmm... Well, duh.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.840
It's all in your diary.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.760
- Way to hide
- your private thoughts.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.520
Oi! Give that back!

21:44.560 --> 21:45.960
Who says you could

21:45.961 --> 21:47.360
go through my stuff like that?!

21:47.400 --> 21:50.200
Violetta, you are such a jerk.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.480
Yes you are.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.040
What is this...?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.440
You set me up?!

21:55.480 --> 21:56.760
- You used me!

21:56.761 --> 21:58.040
- You bet I did.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.160
Just like you're using me

21:59.161 --> 22:00.240
to get people to like you!

22:00.280 --> 22:03.040
Well, Mia likes me for who I am!

22:03.080 --> 22:05.280
She's a real friend.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.560
And I'm not gonna

22:06.561 --> 22:07.800
hang out with you anymore!

22:07.840 --> 22:09.560
Way to go Paula!

22:09.600 --> 22:11.080
Oh, boo-hoo.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.040
- You know what?
- Fine, have it your way.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.040
But make no mistake...

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
you've just made

22:20.081 --> 22:21.081
an enemy for life!

22:23.160 --> 22:25.720
Wow, that was a bit dramatic.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.780
I'm sorry

22:26.781 --> 22:27.800
I mistrusted you before.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.940
It's okay. That's what

22:29.941 --> 22:32.040
friendship is all about, right?

22:32.080 --> 22:33.680
- Umm... I think
- we're gonna need to

22:33.720 --> 22:35.320
Get Violetta out of your system.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.440
Yep. You're

22:36.441 --> 22:37.520
with Team Terrific now!

22:39.880 --> 22:41.520
So um... mind helping me

22:41.521 --> 22:43.160
sneak out please.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.800
[laughs] Come on.

22:44.801 --> 22:46.400
Hide behind us, Vincent.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.440
My friends call me Vinthent.
