00:01.343 --> 00:02.910
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.270 --> 00:06.071
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

00:06.073 --> 00:09.140
A fine institution.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.242
The place where
Albert Einstein taught,

00:11.244 --> 00:13.345
and where Leonard got his PhD,

00:13.347 --> 00:15.814
so it may have gone downhill.

00:15.816 --> 00:18.383
Gentlemen, you may
remember Dr. Nowitzki.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.785
She's back at Caltech
for her postdoc.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.087
- Hello.
GUYS: Hi.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.555
Question:

00:23.557 --> 00:27.125
are you seeking a romantic
relationship with me?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.727
What if I were?

00:28.729 --> 00:32.197
Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.933
We're colleagues, I'm
currently in a relation...

00:39.506 --> 00:41.673
(knocking)
SHELDON: Amy? Amy.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.541
(knocking continues)
Amy?

00:56.757 --> 00:57.956
Will you marry me?

00:59.292 --> 01:01.292
(ringtone playing)

01:01.294 --> 01:03.928
One moment, please.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.331
Really, you're going to
answer that right now?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.532
It's Leonard.

01:07.534 --> 01:10.068
I don't want to be rude.

01:10.070 --> 01:10.835
Hello?

01:10.837 --> 01:11.870
Oh, hey, where you been?

01:11.872 --> 01:13.204
We've been calling you
for hours.

01:13.206 --> 01:16.141
Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was
on "airplane" mode.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.108
Why?

01:17.110 --> 01:21.112
Because I was on an airplane.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.580
Hey, put him on speaker.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.349
- Yeah.
- Hey, where are you?

01:24.351 --> 01:26.951
I came to Princeton
to see Amy.

01:26.953 --> 01:28.553
It's a funny
story, actually.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.189
I was having lunch
with Dr. Nowitzki,

01:31.191 --> 01:32.557
and she kissed me.

01:32.559 --> 01:33.658
- Excuse me?
- What?

01:33.660 --> 01:34.859
I'm sorry?

01:34.861 --> 01:37.996
And in that moment,
I realized

01:37.998 --> 01:41.366
that Amy was the only woman
I ever wanted to kiss

01:41.368 --> 01:43.168
for the rest of my life.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.638
So I came to New Jersey
to ask her to marry me.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.440
Oh, that's so sweet.
(chuckling)

01:48.442 --> 01:50.742
- Sheldon...
- Yeah, although

01:50.744 --> 01:53.945
there was one man
whose blessing I needed first.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.816
I've thought about it,
and I really want to spend

01:57.818 --> 02:00.318
the rest of my life with Amy.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.054
Do I have your blessing?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.323
Well, Sheldon...

02:06.593 --> 02:09.561
...I think you should make
her finger like Saturn

02:09.562 --> 02:12.497
and put a ring on it.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.501
You asked Stephen Hawking
and not her father?

02:16.503 --> 02:17.969
SHELDON:
Stephen Hawking's a genius.

02:17.971 --> 02:22.207
If he said no, I wasn't gonna
waste my time on her father.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.110
But you did ask my father?

02:25.112 --> 02:27.846
I did. He said yes.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.615
Although, not in a robot voice,
so it wasn't nearly as cool.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.951
Okay. Oh, my God, I can't
believe you guys are engaged.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.452
We're not engaged, yet.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.054
She's taking forever to answer.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.256
Because you're on the phone!

02:40.227 --> 02:42.026
We'll call you back.

02:43.563 --> 02:47.098
(ringtone chiming)

02:47.100 --> 02:48.133
SHELDON:
She said yes.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.001
Yay!

03:21.793 --> 03:23.826
Mother, I have
some good news to share.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.695
We're engaged.

03:27.098 --> 03:30.166
I am so happy for you two,
but I'm not surprised.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.567
I've been praying for this.

03:31.569 --> 03:33.602
Well, God had nothing
to do with it.

03:33.604 --> 03:36.205
It happened because I was
kissing another woman,

03:36.207 --> 03:39.642
and it made me realize
I wanted to be with Amy.

03:39.644 --> 03:41.677
More than one woman
was interested in you?

03:41.679 --> 03:44.413
I might have prayed
a little too hard.

03:44.415 --> 03:46.048
Wait, oh, and I just...

03:46.050 --> 03:47.316
I want to let you know
right now

03:47.318 --> 03:49.485
that we are not
getting married in a church.

03:49.487 --> 03:50.419
That's all right, Sheldon.

03:50.421 --> 03:53.255
Anywhere Jesus is
is a church.

03:53.257 --> 03:54.824
Well, he won't be
at our wedding.

03:54.826 --> 03:56.792
He's in my heart,
so if I'm there,

03:56.794 --> 03:58.694
he'll be there.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.229
Okay, well, then,
he's your plus-one.

04:00.231 --> 04:01.797
You don't get to bring
anyone else.

04:01.799 --> 04:03.833
That's fine.
Love you.

04:03.835 --> 04:05.501
Love you, too.
Bye.

04:06.938 --> 04:09.138
Lord, thank you.

04:09.140 --> 04:10.873
Even though you can do anything,

04:10.875 --> 04:14.577
that was mighty
impressive.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.846
We're engaged.

04:16.848 --> 04:18.748
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

04:18.750 --> 04:20.416
Wait, uh, tell me everything.

04:20.418 --> 04:23.085
Well, Dr. Nowitzki was
kissing me...

04:23.087 --> 04:25.621
Okay, you can stop leading
with that part of the story.

04:26.624 --> 04:28.224
Well, congratulations.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.725
I'm so happy
for you two.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.527
Hold on, I have to
tell Bernadette.

04:31.529 --> 04:32.695
Hey, Bernie, guess what?

04:32.697 --> 04:35.464
Sheldon and Amy got engaged.
Can you believe it?

04:35.466 --> 04:40.169
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe it.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.607
She's so happy...
I think she's crying.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.078
Do you think
Sheldon's gonna want

04:49.080 --> 04:52.181
some weird
<i>Star Trek</i> wedding?

04:52.183 --> 04:54.383
I don't know.

04:54.385 --> 04:56.619
Well, Leonard could barely
finish the words

04:56.621 --> 04:57.787
"Doctor Who wedding cake"

04:57.789 --> 05:00.890
before I shut that down hard.

05:00.892 --> 05:02.425
Mm-hmm.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.693
Are you listening to me?

05:04.695 --> 05:07.430
Yeah, you're mean
to Leonard. I heard you.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.832
Is everything okay?

05:09.834 --> 05:13.135
Look, I'm gonna
tell you something,

05:13.137 --> 05:14.103
but you can't freak out,

05:14.105 --> 05:15.071
because I'm already
freaking out.

05:15.073 --> 05:17.306
Oh, my God,
what is it?

05:17.308 --> 05:19.442
I'm pregnant again.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.677
Wha...

05:27.452 --> 05:30.419
Interesting.

05:32.056 --> 05:33.756
Howard's gonna lose his mind.

05:33.758 --> 05:35.157
Wait, you haven't
told him yet?

05:35.159 --> 05:36.092
No.

05:36.094 --> 05:39.628
You told me first?
Oh, Bernie!

05:40.798 --> 05:43.265
This wasn't supposed
to happen-- we were careful.

05:43.267 --> 05:44.233
Yeah, I didn't even think
you could get pregnant

05:44.235 --> 05:45.267
while you were
breastfeeding.

05:45.269 --> 05:47.903
Well, guess what?
You can.

05:47.905 --> 05:50.506
Okay, look, look,
this is a good thing.

05:50.508 --> 05:51.974
Halley's gonna have
a little brother

05:51.976 --> 05:53.375
or sister to play with.

05:53.377 --> 05:55.945
I guess that would be
pretty cute.

05:55.947 --> 05:57.713
And, you, know, I was
a surprise to my parents,

05:57.715 --> 05:59.148
and my dad said
it was the best thing

05:59.150 --> 06:00.649
that ever happened to them.

06:00.651 --> 06:04.320
Okay. Maybe this baby
actually is a blessing.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.188
Oh, my God, honey,
of course it is.

06:06.190 --> 06:08.357
(exhales)

06:08.359 --> 06:09.725
How am I pregnant again?

06:09.727 --> 06:12.128
Yeah, what were you thinking?

06:15.133 --> 06:18.300
All right, I'm all
checked in to my flight.

06:18.302 --> 06:20.002
Well, I'm sad
you're leaving.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.071
Why'd you only book
a flight for one day?

06:22.073 --> 06:24.773
I came here to propose.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.709
If you'd said no,
I wouldn't want to stick around

06:26.711 --> 06:28.978
looking at your stupid face.

06:30.314 --> 06:32.548
Now, mind you,
your face is only stupid

06:32.550 --> 06:34.550
in the "no" version
of the story.

06:34.552 --> 06:38.754
But I said yes, so I get
a lifetime of this.

06:38.756 --> 06:41.357
Yes, you do, smart face.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.326
Why don't you stay
a few extra days?

06:44.328 --> 06:46.695
Well, I don't have
any other clothes.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.830
We'll get you some.

06:47.832 --> 06:49.665
Oh, I don't know,
I'm pretty particular.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.668
Well, there's a comic book store
less than a mile from here.

06:52.670 --> 06:55.471
Perfect, let's go shopping.

06:55.473 --> 06:58.407
Oh, um, and I'm having dinner
with some colleagues tonight.

06:58.409 --> 07:00.075
I'm sure they'd
love to meet you.

07:00.077 --> 07:01.243
(groans)

07:01.245 --> 07:03.012
Come on, what do you say?

07:03.014 --> 07:06.849
Aw, you're nagging me.

07:06.851 --> 07:08.951
It's like
we're already married.

07:08.953 --> 07:10.186
Is that a yes or a no?

07:10.188 --> 07:13.389
Geez, save some
for the honeymoon.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.927
Look at Nowitzki
over there.

07:17.929 --> 07:19.128
LEONARD: I can't believe
she tried to steal

07:19.130 --> 07:20.896
Sheldon from Amy.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.531
You know what?

07:22.533 --> 07:24.433
I'm gonna go there and tell her
that they're engaged now

07:24.435 --> 07:26.535
and that her little plan
didn't work.

07:26.537 --> 07:27.736
Because you're sticking up
for Sheldon,

07:27.738 --> 07:29.738
or because you're still mad
she rejected you?

07:29.740 --> 07:31.507
Too far away, can't hear you.

07:32.743 --> 07:33.776
Hello, Ramona.

07:33.778 --> 07:35.444
Mm. Hello.

07:35.446 --> 07:38.547
Why are you
sitting by yourself?

07:38.549 --> 07:39.882
Oh, that's right,

07:39.884 --> 07:43.052
Sheldon's in New Jersey
being engaged to Amy.

07:44.055 --> 07:45.621
I heard.

07:45.623 --> 07:47.256
Now that Sheldon's
out of the picture,

07:47.258 --> 07:51.060
I could give you one more chance
to go out with me.

07:51.062 --> 07:53.262
Nope, I'm good.

07:55.466 --> 07:58.033
You sure?

07:58.035 --> 08:00.469
I will not ask again.

08:00.471 --> 08:03.038
I sincerely hope not.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.808
Very well.

08:05.810 --> 08:08.377
I'm going to leave
before this gets awkward.

08:11.682 --> 08:13.649
Hey.

08:13.651 --> 08:14.883
Want me to make dinner?

08:14.885 --> 08:17.052
Uh, sure, but first,
why don't you have a seat?

08:17.054 --> 08:18.787
There's something
I need to show you.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.558
Ooh, if it's how to make
dinner, that'd be great.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.362
(sighs)

08:30.401 --> 08:33.501
Is this a... pregnancy test?

08:33.504 --> 08:35.604
Yes.

08:38.909 --> 08:42.878
That means... positive?

08:42.880 --> 08:45.147
Yes.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.950
No.

08:51.088 --> 08:52.054
Yes.

08:52.056 --> 08:55.157
(giggling nervously):
N-- No.

08:56.027 --> 08:58.227
Yes.

08:59.563 --> 09:01.864
(high-pitched):
No!

09:05.536 --> 09:07.303
How could this even happen?

09:07.305 --> 09:09.405
Uh, w--
we were careful.

09:09.407 --> 09:10.873
- Well, it did.
- No!

09:10.875 --> 09:12.241
- Yes! Yes!
- No! No!

09:12.243 --> 09:13.542
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

09:13.544 --> 09:14.710
Okay! Okay! Okay!

09:14.712 --> 09:16.312
Well, w-what are we gonna do?

09:16.314 --> 09:17.780
What do you mean
what are we gonna do?

09:17.782 --> 09:18.847
We're gonna have another baby.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.349
- No! No!
- Stop that!

09:20.351 --> 09:22.151
- Yes!
- I'm trying!

09:24.689 --> 09:27.289
Look, I know
it's scary, but...

09:27.291 --> 09:30.759
we're both responsible adults,
we can do this.

09:30.761 --> 09:32.361
You really think so?

09:33.130 --> 09:35.798
(crying):
No!

09:39.670 --> 09:41.670
Hey, Stuart.
Oh, hey, Raj.

09:41.672 --> 09:42.738
What can I help you with?

09:42.740 --> 09:44.873
I need to buy
an engagement gift.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.810
Well, you came
to the wrong place.

09:47.812 --> 09:49.845
It's for Sheldon and Amy.

09:49.847 --> 09:52.147
No way! They're engaged?
Yeah.

09:52.149 --> 09:54.316
Well, that's exciting news.
(chuckles)

09:54.318 --> 09:56.085
Who would've thought Sheldon
and Amy would be the next two

09:56.087 --> 09:57.086
to tie the knot?

09:57.088 --> 09:58.721
Tell me about it. I'm the one

09:58.723 --> 10:01.790
who caught the bouquet at
Leonard and Penny's wedding.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.125
Okay.

10:03.127 --> 10:04.693
Uh... you know,

10:04.695 --> 10:07.162
they might like this.

10:08.866 --> 10:11.100
Superman and Wonder Woman,
it's kind of romantic.

10:11.102 --> 10:12.835
Hmm.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.169
You know what?

10:14.171 --> 10:16.004
Why am I buying them a gift?

10:16.006 --> 10:16.939
They have love.

10:16.941 --> 10:18.440
Screw them and
their happiness.

10:18.442 --> 10:20.776
What do you have for someone
who's bitter and alone?

10:22.480 --> 10:26.014
Literally everything.

10:27.184 --> 10:29.451
Sheldon, these are the heads
of my research team.

10:29.453 --> 10:30.586
Oh, hello.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.920
AMY:
Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris,

10:31.922 --> 10:33.655
this is my fiancé,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

10:33.657 --> 10:35.023
That's the first time
I've said that

10:35.025 --> 10:36.892
and it kind of gave me
the goose bumps.

10:36.894 --> 10:39.061
(chuckles)
Dr. Cooper,

10:39.063 --> 10:41.296
we are so excited to meet you.
SHELDON: Oh.

10:41.298 --> 10:43.198
Well, that's very kind of you.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.702
If you'd like, I could autograph
your menus after dinner, yeah?

10:46.704 --> 10:48.871
But I better not see those
on eBay.

10:48.873 --> 10:50.139
(laughs)

10:50.141 --> 10:51.974
No, no, no, we're just
excited to meet the man

10:51.976 --> 10:53.809
who landed
this brilliant woman here.

10:53.811 --> 10:54.877
(chuckles softly)
SHELDON: Oh!

10:54.879 --> 10:55.944
That wasn't hard,

10:55.946 --> 10:57.780
she threw herself at me.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.184
Now, getting the universe
to show me its naughty bits,

11:02.186 --> 11:04.853
that-that took some doing.

11:04.855 --> 11:07.089
Sheldon's a physicist.

11:07.091 --> 11:09.992
Oh.
Oh, that's nice.

11:13.164 --> 11:14.763
Amy, I recently read
your paper on lesions

11:14.765 --> 11:16.965
in the olfactory receptors
in the brain.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.700
It was inspired.

11:18.702 --> 11:21.036
Oh, well,
I guess it didn't stink.

11:21.038 --> 11:23.305
But if it did,
that rat wouldn't have known it.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.574
(laughter)
I'm sorry,

11:25.576 --> 11:26.708
I'm sure you don't
want to sit here

11:26.710 --> 11:28.410
and listen to
a bunch of work talk.

11:28.412 --> 11:29.711
Oh, no, I love it.

11:29.713 --> 11:30.779
No, but let's talk about work.

11:30.781 --> 11:32.481
Amy's work, my work.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.149
Yeah, why don't
we start with my work?

11:35.619 --> 11:37.052
Actually, I do have
a question for Dr. Cooper.

11:37.054 --> 11:39.054
When Amy first
told you about

11:39.056 --> 11:41.089
her approach to
synaptic tracing,

11:41.091 --> 11:43.592
did you think it was gonna
revolutionize the field?

11:43.594 --> 11:45.561
(stammers)
Really?

11:45.563 --> 11:47.496
That's your question?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.531
What are you,
<i>Entertainment Tonight?</i>

11:49.533 --> 11:51.467
You know what?

11:51.469 --> 11:53.101
Let me give you a
better question. Here,

11:53.103 --> 11:54.570
um, "Dr. Cooper,

11:54.572 --> 11:56.939
"I heard you were working on
a top-secret project

11:56.941 --> 11:58.273
"for the U.S. military.

11:58.275 --> 11:59.408
Why don't you tell us
about that?"

11:59.410 --> 12:01.677
See, that's a great question.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.613
Okay, what was that like?

12:04.615 --> 12:08.050
Oh, I can't tell you that,
it's top-secret.

12:17.928 --> 12:20.929
Boy, that was exhausting.

12:20.931 --> 12:23.398
You know, no offense, but your
colleagues were pretty rude.

12:25.168 --> 12:26.935
Really,<i> they</i> were rude?

12:26.937 --> 12:27.936
Yes.

12:27.938 --> 12:29.304
They just kept talking about you

12:29.306 --> 12:31.006
and how great you are,

12:31.008 --> 12:33.608
no matter how many times
I brought me up.

12:33.610 --> 12:35.410
You know,
these are my colleagues

12:35.412 --> 12:36.945
and they want to talk
about my work.

12:36.947 --> 12:38.813
Why does that bother you
so much?

12:38.815 --> 12:41.049
Because I was there.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.084
It's like having
Optimus Prime over to dinner

12:43.086 --> 12:45.253
and not asking him
to turn into a truck.

12:46.089 --> 12:48.089
You know what, Sheldon?

12:48.091 --> 12:50.859
You're not always the smartest
person in every room.

12:50.861 --> 12:53.428
You may not even be the smartest
person in this room.

12:53.430 --> 12:55.196
Oh, I am sorry.

12:55.198 --> 12:58.533
What, is Neil deGrasse Tyson
hiding behind the couch?

12:58.535 --> 12:59.734
'Cause if he is,
he's not that smart,

12:59.736 --> 13:01.836
it's pretty dusty back there.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.141
Hey, where are you going?

13:06.143 --> 13:08.009
I'm storming off to my room.

13:08.011 --> 13:10.245
Well, then where am I
supposed to storm off to?

13:10.247 --> 13:12.414
Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?

13:12.416 --> 13:14.215
(door closes)

13:16.820 --> 13:18.553
Is there another bedroom?

13:19.856 --> 13:21.990
Perhaps a-a den?

13:24.895 --> 13:28.363
So, how are you guys
doing with all the new

13:28.365 --> 13:31.633
events in your womb?

13:33.437 --> 13:35.604
Good, you know?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.706
Obviously,
it was a surprise.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.774
There was some crying

13:39.776 --> 13:41.076
and some yelling.
Some suggestion

13:41.078 --> 13:42.777
of make-up sex
that did not go over well,

13:42.779 --> 13:44.779
even though it's not like
we can get more pregnant.

13:47.851 --> 13:50.952
But then we realized that
it's a gift, in the sense

13:50.954 --> 13:52.687
that we didn't
ask for it,

13:52.689 --> 13:54.089
and we may not
have chosen it...

13:54.091 --> 13:58.059
And we already have one.

13:58.061 --> 14:00.261
You know, whenever
I find a top I like,

14:00.263 --> 14:04.165
I always go back and get a
second one in a different color.

14:06.737 --> 14:11.139
Which I hope is not the case
with your baby.

14:12.676 --> 14:16.044
I know you guys are freaked out,
but you're great parents,

14:16.046 --> 14:18.847
and if you ever need help,
we are here for you.

14:18.849 --> 14:20.615
Yeah, anything at all, just ask.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.385
Ooh, you know what you could do?

14:23.387 --> 14:26.187
You could have a baby, too.

14:28.892 --> 14:31.559
I'm sorry, what?

14:31.561 --> 14:34.562
No, that's a great idea,
we could go through it together.

14:34.564 --> 14:35.964
Wouldn't that be fun?

14:35.966 --> 14:37.165
(chuckles)

14:37.167 --> 14:38.366
You guys were just saying

14:38.368 --> 14:40.769
how freaked out
and miserable you are.

14:40.771 --> 14:42.904
I say lots of crazy things.

14:42.906 --> 14:45.807
I'm pregnant and hormonal.

14:45.809 --> 14:48.176
Do it! Have a baby, do it!

14:49.546 --> 14:52.047
Come on, it'd be so cute,
our kids playing together?

14:52.049 --> 14:53.882
What do you say, why don't
you two hit the old mattress

14:53.884 --> 14:55.784
and whip up a family?

14:55.786 --> 14:57.285
Okay, we're not
gonna have a baby

14:57.287 --> 14:59.054
just to make you
guys feel better.

14:59.056 --> 15:01.956
Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby
it's gonna be when we are ready,

15:01.958 --> 15:03.692
or when I'm certain
Penny is gonna leave me.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.194
Exactly.

15:08.899 --> 15:11.599
They're my friends,
and I should be happy for them.

15:11.601 --> 15:13.134
A-And I'm trying,

15:13.136 --> 15:17.405
but all I feel is this gnawing,
empty sensation in my gut.

15:17.407 --> 15:19.374
I had that once.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.143
Turned out it was a tapeworm.

15:24.648 --> 15:26.381
Cool. Uh...

15:27.451 --> 15:28.683
It's just...

15:28.685 --> 15:30.852
it's hard talking
to my other friends about this,

15:30.854 --> 15:32.120
but I knew you would understand.

15:32.122 --> 15:33.354
Why is that?

15:33.356 --> 15:34.989
Because you and I
are both alone,

15:34.991 --> 15:36.991
which is actually
kind of comforting,

15:36.993 --> 15:39.127
because at least
we can be alone together.

15:39.129 --> 15:41.496
Mm. This is-this is awkward.

15:41.498 --> 15:44.599
I, um, I was actually gonna
close up a little early tonight

15:44.601 --> 15:46.301
'cause I have a date.

15:46.303 --> 15:48.069
Really?

15:48.071 --> 15:49.871
Yeah.

15:49.873 --> 15:51.172
(clears throat)

15:51.174 --> 15:54.776
Forgive me if I'm having trouble
being happy for you.

15:54.778 --> 15:59.347
Don't be silly,
I'm loving your pain.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.519
Is this how our marriage
is going to be?

16:04.521 --> 16:06.121
Sometimes people
will be more interested

16:06.123 --> 16:08.289
in talking to her than to me?

16:08.291 --> 16:11.259
Are you sitting in a bathroom?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.328
Yes.

16:13.330 --> 16:14.929
I needed a place to storm off to

16:14.931 --> 16:17.398
and it was all
that was available.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.666
Fine.

16:18.668 --> 16:22.971
But if I hear a flush,
this conversation is over.

16:22.973 --> 16:26.341
Those people were in the
presence of a world-class mind,

16:26.343 --> 16:30.011
and all they wanted to talk
about was their own nonsense.

16:30.013 --> 16:33.748
Can you see the irony
in that statement?

16:35.585 --> 16:37.786
How about now?

16:39.723 --> 16:41.923
How about now?

16:44.961 --> 16:46.327
I'll wait.

16:48.532 --> 16:49.798
LEONARD:
Uh...

16:49.800 --> 16:51.166
Surprise.

16:51.168 --> 16:53.902
Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?

16:53.904 --> 16:55.236
No.

16:55.238 --> 16:57.438
Wait.

16:59.576 --> 17:00.742
No.

17:00.744 --> 17:02.010
No.

17:02.012 --> 17:03.812
All right, so what
are we celebrating?

17:03.814 --> 17:06.381
Well, you know, Bernadette
and Howard are pregnant again,

17:06.383 --> 17:08.148
and Amy and Sheldon
are getting married.

17:08.151 --> 17:09.818
I didn't want you
to feel left out.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.685
Ah. Left out?

17:11.688 --> 17:13.721
Well, Bernadette has to grow
a baby inside of her,

17:13.723 --> 17:15.022
and Amy has to marry one.

17:15.025 --> 17:16.958
My life is great.

17:18.528 --> 17:20.094
So do you not want the cake?

17:20.096 --> 17:22.931
Try and take it away,
see what happens.

17:24.901 --> 17:28.469
Oh, crap,
it is our anniversary.

17:28.471 --> 17:31.439
Happy anniversary!

17:33.743 --> 17:35.476
Amy.

17:35.478 --> 17:39.881
There's something
I need to say to you.

17:39.883 --> 17:41.049
I'm listening.

17:42.252 --> 17:45.486
I've been thinking
about the Avengers.

17:47.090 --> 17:49.457
I believe that.

17:49.459 --> 17:50.859
But I don't think
that's something

17:50.861 --> 17:52.193
you needed to say to me.

17:52.195 --> 17:57.065
I realized
that Iron Man is great.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.266
And also,

17:58.268 --> 18:00.168
that Captain America is great.

18:00.170 --> 18:04.038
And sometimes, Iron Man
is in a Captain America movie,

18:04.040 --> 18:06.774
and he's not mad
it's not an Iron Man movie.

18:06.776 --> 18:09.711
You know, he can fly in,
give the audience a thrill,

18:09.713 --> 18:11.045
and then fly away.

18:11.047 --> 18:14.883
And that should've
been me tonight.

18:14.885 --> 18:19.053
I should've been the delightful
cameo in your movie.

18:19.055 --> 18:21.356
Thank you, Sheldon.

18:21.358 --> 18:23.658
Instead, I was like
the Hulk, and I...

18:23.660 --> 18:26.194
Okay, please stop talking
about the Avengers.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.297
Anyway.

18:29.299 --> 18:31.199
I'm proud of you.

18:31.201 --> 18:32.934
And I'm going to try
to do a better job

18:32.936 --> 18:37.405
of sharing the spotlight
because we're a team.

18:37.407 --> 18:42.844
You know?
Much like t-the Dodgers.

18:44.714 --> 18:49.350
If they had superpowers,
and fought crime.

18:49.352 --> 18:53.354
And Thor was in them.

18:53.356 --> 18:55.256
Sheldon, I know this isn't easy,

18:55.258 --> 18:59.327
but you'll have
a whole lifetime to practice.

18:59.329 --> 19:03.631
I-It could take that long,
I'm really bad at it.

19:05.969 --> 19:08.069
You know, maybe, um,

19:08.071 --> 19:11.706
I should start right now,
and go back to Pasadena

19:11.708 --> 19:14.409
and let you have
this experience to yourself.

19:14.411 --> 19:16.277
You just want to go back

19:16.279 --> 19:18.546
'cause that's where everybody
makes a fuss over you.

19:18.548 --> 19:21.883
You know, your colleagues
are right, you are brilliant.

19:32.706 --> 19:34.239
Hello.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.533
- Hey. - Hey.
- Amy, welcome back.

19:35.534 --> 19:37.709
Oh, l-let me see the ring.

19:37.711 --> 19:40.211
Ooh, nice.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.514
H-Hey, her eyes are up there.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.419
I-Is that the woman
who kissed Sheldon?

19:47.421 --> 19:49.220
Uh... Could be.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.723
Hard to say.
Tell us about Princeton.

19:51.725 --> 19:53.491
Excuse me for a minute.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.360
Not-- well, we'll
catch up later.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.829
This is going to be
the biggest smackdown

19:57.831 --> 19:59.831
since my Aunt Noopur showed up
at the family reunion

19:59.833 --> 20:02.600
wearing the same sari
as my cousin Sruti.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.838
Dr. Nowitzki?

20:06.840 --> 20:08.606
Oh.

20:08.608 --> 20:12.477
Dr. Fowler. Um, hello.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.046
Thank you. Thank you so much.
