WEBVTT

00:20.450 --> 00:25.217
Thought I told you not to run
them sheep on my land!

00:27.457 --> 00:29.118
It's my land, Garrett.

00:29.292 --> 00:32.056
It became mine when
we signed that lease.

00:32.596 --> 00:34.564
He's right, Mr. Garrett.

00:35.565 --> 00:39.524
I'm paying you off when we get back,
and I'm breaking that goddamn lease.

00:39.903 --> 00:43.532
-I don't allow the law would agree to that.
-What law is that?

00:44.074 --> 00:46.542
Santa Fe Ring law?

00:46.710 --> 00:48.041
Shit.

00:48.345 --> 00:52.748
-Goddamn law is ruining the country.
-Ain't you still a part of that law?

00:54.251 --> 00:56.344
Something wrong with that harness.

00:58.722 --> 01:02.852
I believe they elected you and paid you
good wages for killing the Kid, huh?

01:06.096 --> 01:08.929
You rotten son of a bitch.

01:26.116 --> 01:29.779
-You try your luck, Eno.
-You miss more than anybody else does.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.585
I'll bet on it.

02:05.655 --> 02:07.350
You want the breast or the thigh?

02:07.958 --> 02:09.482
What he always gets.

02:11.228 --> 02:13.662
I want a breast and a thigh.

02:18.301 --> 02:19.563
Jesus Christ!

02:20.971 --> 02:22.404
-Who is it?
-Get down!

02:23.707 --> 02:25.368
Goddamn, that's Garrett.

02:35.552 --> 02:37.179
Hello, Bill.

02:37.721 --> 02:42.055
-It's fair shooting for an old married man.
-Lucky, I guess. How are you, Kid?

02:42.225 --> 02:44.022
-Good to see you.
-Good seeing you.

02:44.194 --> 02:46.992
-Hey, Billy!
-Who's this you got with you?

02:47.164 --> 02:50.622
-Looking good.
-Having some kind of fiesta? Hello, Black.

02:51.535 --> 02:54.936
We always live like this.
You ought to visit us more often.

02:55.105 --> 02:59.064
I reckon the whole damn territory's
gonna be one big open jug for us now.

02:59.242 --> 03:01.904
-Is that right, Pat?
-Ain't that right, Pat?

03:02.112 --> 03:07.106
Take a two-day ride from Lincoln just to pay
me back the 2 dollars you owe me, Pat?

03:07.918 --> 03:09.886
You'd better collect it now, Black.

03:10.754 --> 03:13.348
We ain't gonna be seeing much
of Pat these days.

03:14.357 --> 03:18.589
Say, I understand those Mexican señoritas
are still pretty as ever down there.

03:19.229 --> 03:20.526
Yeah?

03:20.697 --> 03:24.064
I know one's waiting on you, hoss,
with a knife.

03:24.701 --> 03:27.932
-Remember them sisters?
-No. Which ones were they?

03:28.104 --> 03:30.629
That one you got up and asked
how much you owed.

03:30.807 --> 03:34.334
And she said,
"Whatever you think it's worth."

03:34.511 --> 03:37.309
You threw a dime on her pillow.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.881
Girl said, "If that's all it's worth,
I might as well sew it up."

03:42.719 --> 03:45.381
Son of a bitch.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

03:49.092 --> 03:52.118
You don't figure he's too good
to drink with us, do you?

03:52.295 --> 03:54.092
Maybe it's the other way around.

04:00.537 --> 04:03.472
Jesus, don't you get stale
around here, Bill?

04:03.640 --> 04:08.134
Maybe a year or so down in Mexico
will do you some good.

04:09.045 --> 04:11.946
I didn't figure you'd bother
to make a ride out here.

04:12.549 --> 04:14.779
Shit, you know me better than that.

04:14.951 --> 04:16.248
You heard about Eben?

04:16.586 --> 04:19.248
He drowned in the Rio Grande.

04:19.422 --> 04:21.822
Trying to get to that old Mex
you're talking about.

04:22.259 --> 04:24.625
He took two of the posse with him.

04:25.562 --> 04:27.655
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:29.065 --> 04:31.329
I always liked old Eben.

04:35.105 --> 04:37.938
At least he knew when it was
the right time to leave.

04:39.242 --> 04:41.676
We did have some times, didn't we?

04:45.749 --> 04:48.946
It's gotta be pretty hard
to turn your back on all that.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.285
You want it straight?

04:55.458 --> 04:57.085
If that's what you're here for.

05:00.764 --> 05:03.255
The electorate...

05:04.968 --> 05:06.060
...wants you gone.

05:07.070 --> 05:09.038
Out of the country.

05:14.711 --> 05:17.475
But are they telling me,
or are they asking me?

05:22.686 --> 05:23.914
I'm asking you.

05:27.590 --> 05:30.354
But in five days, I'm making you.

05:32.395 --> 05:35.330
Because I might take over sheriff
of Lincoln County.

05:35.498 --> 05:37.090
Old Pat.

05:38.668 --> 05:40.966
Sheriff Pat Garrett.

05:41.438 --> 05:44.236
Sold out to the Santa Fe Ring.

05:48.111 --> 05:49.703
How does it feel?

05:51.081 --> 05:52.981
It...

05:55.452 --> 05:59.388
...feels like times have changed.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.321
Times maybe.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.084
Not me.

06:14.371 --> 06:16.635
Hey, why don't you stick around.

06:16.806 --> 06:18.706
We got a few days left, ain't we?

06:20.176 --> 06:22.542
No, I gotta get back.

06:26.483 --> 06:27.814
Adiós, Pat.

06:28.551 --> 06:29.984
Adiós, Bill.

06:30.387 --> 06:32.321
Don't press your luck.

06:36.025 --> 06:38.186
I ain't worried about my luck.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.366
Why don't you kill him.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.034
Why?

06:56.946 --> 06:58.538
He's my friend.

08:46.289 --> 08:49.588
Get on up, Billy.
You hear what I'm saying?

08:52.195 --> 08:55.494
I ain't making no money
watching you boys sleep.

08:55.665 --> 08:59.328
You like to waste the best part
of the damn day.

08:59.769 --> 09:02.431
Let that squirrel loose!
You'll shake it to death.

09:02.605 --> 09:05.506
-I'm just scratching.
-Chisum's cattle is waiting.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.905
Oh, let them wait.

09:12.649 --> 09:18.110
I hate a son of a bitch that gets up
noisy and full of himself.

09:18.288 --> 09:21.519
I ain't in this for my health, hateful.

09:26.763 --> 09:27.752
That's awful.

09:35.305 --> 09:38.035
-Pat ain't gonna like this.
-What?

09:38.474 --> 09:43.002
Coming down hard on him
the day after he got his new badge.

09:43.179 --> 09:45.306
Hell, there ain't no way
he's gonna know.

09:46.249 --> 09:47.944
I ain't afraid of Pat Garrett.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.449
Well, all right, a little bit.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.422
Bastards.

09:59.262 --> 10:01.822
I'd best go get them horses watered.

10:32.028 --> 10:34.223
Goddamn Chisum.

10:34.631 --> 10:36.724
How'd he know we was here?

10:37.333 --> 10:40.268
-Hell, that's Garrett.
-Goddamn him too.

10:40.436 --> 10:44.270
Now he's got Bell and half the town
of Lincoln out there with him.

10:52.548 --> 10:54.140
Help me up.

10:55.218 --> 10:57.186
Sweet Mary's ass!

10:57.453 --> 10:59.216
Don't let me go down.

11:03.192 --> 11:07.094
They killed me. I'm gut-shot for sure.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.590
Hold your fire!

11:12.769 --> 11:14.236
Hold your fire!

11:14.604 --> 11:15.866
Hold it!

11:17.106 --> 11:18.903
Bill!

11:19.075 --> 11:20.975
Come on out!
You don't have a chance!

11:22.712 --> 11:24.441
What are you taking me in for?

11:26.215 --> 11:27.705
Which one was that?

11:28.351 --> 11:29.648
Buckshot Roberts.

11:30.887 --> 11:32.787
For the killing of Buckshot Roberts!

11:34.023 --> 11:36.321
Hell, that was a year ago.

11:37.193 --> 11:39.127
I shot him straight up.

11:41.998 --> 11:43.465
Come on in, Pat!

11:44.033 --> 11:45.557
I'll warm your breakfast!

11:54.644 --> 11:55.633
Guess he ate.

11:58.347 --> 12:01.407
They're closing down
the store on us for sure.

12:12.528 --> 12:14.519
Maybe it's time you took a walk.

12:18.835 --> 12:20.962
Hell, yes.

12:21.137 --> 12:23.230
Why not?

12:23.773 --> 12:25.263
I can still hold a gun.

12:30.213 --> 12:33.046
We gotta move. I'm going fast.

12:34.617 --> 12:35.948
Kid.

12:37.787 --> 12:40.051
Sweet Mary's ass!

12:41.858 --> 12:45.794
I'm going now, so, by God,
let's get on with it.

12:47.296 --> 12:48.593
Hey.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.760
I ain't afraid of him now.

12:53.936 --> 12:57.133
Hold your fire! We're coming out!

12:58.107 --> 12:59.506
Hold it!

13:01.144 --> 13:05.171
-You go left. I'll go right.
-Might be they ain't circled us.

13:05.348 --> 13:08.875
Might be the dog would've caught
the rabbit if he hadn't thought to shit.

13:10.453 --> 13:12.683
Where are the goddamn horses?

13:38.548 --> 13:41.016
-That's enough!
-Hold it! Hold it!

13:43.653 --> 13:46.019
All right, Kid!

13:46.189 --> 13:48.214
Come on out if you're still alive!

13:49.125 --> 13:51.355
Game's over!

13:54.897 --> 13:56.387
Coming out, Pat!

14:41.344 --> 14:42.971
You're in poor company, Pat.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.008
Yeah, I'm alive, though.

14:51.654 --> 14:53.349
So am I.

15:23.352 --> 15:26.685
I never figured to hear you brag
on being a working man.

15:28.691 --> 15:31.558
Well, I never figured you
for the law either.

15:34.697 --> 15:37.257
It's just a way of staying alive.

15:38.501 --> 15:41.629
No matter what side you're on,
you're always right.

15:43.039 --> 15:48.067
And I aim to live to be rich,
old and gray.

15:48.711 --> 15:51.373
That's a fine ambition, Pat.

15:52.982 --> 15:56.713
You keep thinking like that.
I'll think on how I'll spend your money.

15:56.886 --> 15:58.911
Only thing you've got
to think about...

15:59.488 --> 16:02.719
...is when you stand before
the highest court there is.

16:02.892 --> 16:05.224
May it sit in judgment
on your rotten soul.

16:06.295 --> 16:08.229
Now, you listen. Listen to me good.

16:08.397 --> 16:12.026
Before that rope snaps,
it'll hit you like a bolt of lightning...

16:12.201 --> 16:14.829
...that what I've been telling you
is the truth!

16:16.772 --> 16:19.434
You'll learn to believe
before I'm finished.

16:20.376 --> 16:22.105
That's 3 to you.

16:24.847 --> 16:26.371
What do you believe in, Bell?

16:30.419 --> 16:34.253
I do believe I'm gonna
have to see that bet...

16:34.757 --> 16:36.850
-...and raise you 5.
-Billy...

16:37.026 --> 16:40.860
...somewhere in the Good Book,
it says there's a time for everything.

16:41.030 --> 16:43.760
A time to love, a time to hate...

16:44.467 --> 16:46.128
...a time to kill.

16:48.504 --> 16:51.871
But now it's time
you got close to God, boy.

16:52.608 --> 16:54.735
I heard God's fast...

16:54.910 --> 16:58.505
...but I have to go up in front of him
myself before I'd bet on it.

16:59.548 --> 17:01.311
You will.

17:04.987 --> 17:06.511
Well, that puts me on my way.

17:06.689 --> 17:09.453
I got to go collect a few more taxes.
He's all yours.

17:09.892 --> 17:11.154
Two days, boys.

17:11.327 --> 17:13.795
I count eight days till dawn, Billy.

17:13.963 --> 17:18.366
You'd best be on your knees and making
the acquaintance of your Lord and master.

17:19.101 --> 17:23.435
Pat, keep that mule's asshole away from me
before I have to break him.

17:23.939 --> 17:25.873
I surely wish you'd try, son.

17:26.042 --> 17:29.034
I got my shotgun full of 16 thin dimes.

17:29.345 --> 17:32.246
Enough to spread you out
like a crazy woman's quilt.

17:32.415 --> 17:34.849
-Bob.
-Why don't you sing a song of Jesus...

17:35.017 --> 17:38.418
-...while there's still a way.
-Bob. Bob.

17:38.587 --> 17:39.884
Damn it.

17:41.657 --> 17:45.593
You mess around with him one more time,
I'll send your ass back to Texas.

17:45.761 --> 17:46.955
Don't.

17:48.497 --> 17:51.193
I think I'd like to keep him here a while.

18:23.766 --> 18:24.960
I fold, Billy.

18:32.875 --> 18:35.070
Folding three queens, now, are you?

18:35.945 --> 18:39.346
You must be afraid
I'll go out a loser, Bell.

18:40.416 --> 18:44.216
-I guess I just ain't seeing them.
-Well, I'll tell you what...

18:45.020 --> 18:47.716
...as long as I'm breathing,
let's play it straight.

18:48.524 --> 18:52.722
I ain't sold my saddle like you
and the rest of the town boys, Bell.

18:53.696 --> 18:56.722
Or it's just Bob that smells
like street shit over there.

19:00.769 --> 19:02.703
On your knees!

19:02.872 --> 19:04.601
Kiss my ass.

19:07.343 --> 19:08.367
Bob!

19:10.346 --> 19:12.143
Repent, you son of a bitch!

19:13.749 --> 19:15.580
Sweet Jesus, I repent.

19:15.751 --> 19:18.083
Leave off, Bob! You've gone loco!

19:32.334 --> 19:34.859
I'm going across the street
and have a drink.

19:35.037 --> 19:36.902
I'm thirsty as hell.

19:38.140 --> 19:42.042
I wanna tell you one last thing
personal, Kid.

19:46.048 --> 19:49.176
It's gonna be a loose rope
and a long drop.

19:53.122 --> 19:56.023
That last thump got my guts going.

19:56.792 --> 19:59.124
I need to go to the outhouse.

20:14.009 --> 20:17.308
My horse locoed on me once
coming back from Pacheco.

20:17.713 --> 20:20.238
I cut the second bar in his mouth
and bleed him.

20:20.416 --> 20:23.385
He died on me,
and I ended up walking 40 miles.

20:25.955 --> 20:27.786
I never was much for walking.

20:27.957 --> 20:30.289
Well, I ain't never walked a mile since.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.855
Fell in with a bunch of Mescaleros.

20:39.735 --> 20:44.172
They was just off the reservation,
and I was "suspicioned" of them.

20:44.506 --> 20:48.408
But I had some biscuit on me.
I give it to them, and they just rode off.

20:55.484 --> 20:57.179
That's a hell of a story, Bell.

21:03.926 --> 21:06.952
You know, I believe old Pat's
lost his sand.

21:07.129 --> 21:09.256
He won't come on a man.

21:09.431 --> 21:14.027
You ought not to talk about him that way.
You and him used to be pretty close.

21:15.704 --> 21:17.899
He ain't the same man.

21:23.746 --> 21:27.307
He signed himself over to Chisum
and every other landowner...

21:27.483 --> 21:30.646
...that's trying to put a fence
around this country.

21:31.186 --> 21:33.484
That's what you been doing, ain't it?

21:33.656 --> 21:36.250
Selling us out and getting fat.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.791
Ain't that easy, Billy.

21:54.977 --> 21:57.571
You was a friend of Carlyle's,
wasn't you, Bell?

21:57.746 --> 21:59.873
You know I was.

22:01.917 --> 22:05.546
I don't mean to be contrary,
but did I ever tell you how he died?

22:06.822 --> 22:10.383
I shot him three times in the back,
blew his goddamn head off.

22:12.361 --> 22:14.329
I don't wanna kill you, Bell.

22:15.331 --> 22:17.299
Well, I sure hope you don't, Billy.

22:18.667 --> 22:20.157
Then just move toward me.

22:23.739 --> 22:26.537
Don't. Don't do it, please.

22:29.311 --> 22:31.836
You wouldn't shoot me in the back, Billy.

22:39.621 --> 22:42.351
-What the hell was that?
-There's been a shooting.

22:45.994 --> 22:47.222
Get in the house!

22:55.037 --> 22:57.972
-My God, he's got a shotgun.
-Somebody get the sheriff!

23:00.809 --> 23:03.369
How does Jesus look to you now, Bob?

23:04.046 --> 23:05.377
Bonney's killed Bell!

23:06.181 --> 23:08.615
Yeah, and he's killed me too.

23:16.658 --> 23:18.125
Keep the change, Bob.

23:36.779 --> 23:38.041
Bring me an ax.

24:10.012 --> 24:12.503
Get back, I don't wanna kill you.

24:20.656 --> 24:24.490
Go over to that livery stable,
get me the best horse you've got.

27:01.516 --> 27:03.507
Caught your horse, Billy.

27:03.685 --> 27:05.243
Try him again.

27:08.991 --> 27:13.360
By God, I think I'm just gonna trade you
that fine brown horse for your buckskin.

27:13.528 --> 27:15.928
What the hell, Billy?

27:22.437 --> 27:26.965
I'll thrown in about $1.60 worth of change
if you can dig it out of old Bob there.

29:30.732 --> 29:34.896
Would some of you people
get him up off the ground and into it?

29:36.304 --> 29:39.102
Anything you say, sheriff.

29:49.985 --> 29:52.078
Hell of a mess, Pat.

29:53.054 --> 29:55.113
Shot Bell and Ollinger and rode on out.

29:55.290 --> 29:58.623
Yeah. Do me up good this time, Zeppy.

30:00.862 --> 30:02.625
And leave the mustache on it.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.998
-Is the boy around?
-Boy.

30:17.813 --> 30:19.303
Speak to Mr. Garrett.

30:20.515 --> 30:22.312
Yes, sir?

30:22.818 --> 30:25.252
I want you to run all the way down
to my house.

30:25.420 --> 30:28.821
Tell Mrs. Garrett that I'm gonna
be home for dinner.

30:28.990 --> 30:31.982
And then I want you to stampede
over to the courthouse...

30:32.160 --> 30:35.459
...find John Neully and the others
standing around there...

30:35.630 --> 30:39.293
...and tell them to come over here
and pay me a visit. Got that?

30:41.336 --> 30:44.635
John Neully, courthouse. Yes, sir.

31:00.288 --> 31:02.188
Who are you?

31:03.491 --> 31:05.584
That's a good question.

31:12.234 --> 31:14.532
I believe you know of me.

31:15.070 --> 31:17.129
Bill Kermit.

31:19.307 --> 31:23.004
Wanted for horse-thieving
down in Seven Rivers, ain't you?

31:23.178 --> 31:25.408
That'd be me, sheriff.

31:26.448 --> 31:29.611
Killed old C.B. Denning last year
at Silver City...

31:29.784 --> 31:32.878
...for calling you at cheating at monte.

31:33.054 --> 31:36.820
That'd be me. Alamosa Bill.

31:44.933 --> 31:48.061
Well, Bill, I'm gonna make you
my deputy.

31:49.871 --> 31:53.136
Listen, Bill, why don't you go out back...

31:54.175 --> 31:57.110
...find us a couple of steaks
and a mess of eggs.

31:57.545 --> 32:01.777
And get one of them good bottles
they got behind the bar there.

32:03.184 --> 32:05.209
I wanna have me a bath.

32:17.265 --> 32:20.496
It should take you about two weeks
to make the circle.

32:21.269 --> 32:23.294
Yeah.

33:34.075 --> 33:37.203
-They say William Bonney's escaped.
-He has.

33:39.748 --> 33:41.181
And he's in Mexico, I hope.

33:46.988 --> 33:49.684
Where we should be if I had any sense.

33:50.725 --> 33:52.215
If not...

33:52.794 --> 33:55.661
...I'll go after him.
Got too much riding on it not to.

33:57.232 --> 33:59.792
I figure that's why they elected me.

34:01.136 --> 34:03.434
Anyways, I don't give a damn.

34:03.772 --> 34:06.400
Brought him in once, I can do it again...

34:06.574 --> 34:08.405
...if I have to.

34:10.512 --> 34:13.037
You might say that
you are glad to see me.

34:13.982 --> 34:16.644
It's been over a week you've been gone.

34:23.625 --> 34:25.286
I'm sorry.

34:26.828 --> 34:29.888
I gotta go down to the saloon,
there's a...

34:31.232 --> 34:35.362
...drunk down there causing a lot of trouble.
Goes by the name of Alamosa Bill.

34:35.537 --> 34:39.200
Said he rode with the Kid
down in west Texas.

34:40.575 --> 34:43.806
Will you be blessing this house
with your presence for dinner?

34:46.114 --> 34:48.981
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.

34:50.718 --> 34:53.915
-It's been a long year.
-Not now.

34:54.089 --> 34:56.455
My people don't talk to me.

34:57.358 --> 35:01.818
They say you are getting to be too much
of a gringo since you've been sheriff.

35:01.996 --> 35:03.827
That you make deals with Chisum.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.130
You don't touch me.

35:08.002 --> 35:10.232
You are dead inside.

35:10.772 --> 35:13.263
-I wish you'd never put on that badge.
-Not now.

35:14.642 --> 35:17.133
Or I won't be here when you get back!

35:26.221 --> 35:28.052
We'll deal with this...

35:29.557 --> 35:31.422
...when it's over.

35:34.429 --> 35:36.761
I hope he gets away.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.926
Well, he won't.

35:39.334 --> 35:42.269
There's too much play in him.

35:42.804 --> 35:45.034
And not enough in you.

36:22.544 --> 36:24.307
You're late, Pat.

36:26.948 --> 36:28.643
More cognac, please.

36:48.536 --> 36:51.369
-Good of you to come, sheriff.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

36:51.539 --> 36:54.099
-It's a pleasure to see you.
-Thank you, sir.

36:54.275 --> 36:56.709
May I offer you some supper?

36:57.245 --> 37:01.841
Oh, no. No, I think I might have
a little of that brandy, though.

37:02.016 --> 37:04.484
Of course. Some brandy.

37:05.720 --> 37:09.349
I do hope you enjoy
these rainy New Mexican evenings.

37:09.524 --> 37:12.357
They have a fabulous melancholy
to them.

37:13.328 --> 37:17.059
They bring us closer
to some greater design.

37:18.399 --> 37:20.367
At least I hope so.

37:27.342 --> 37:30.971
Allow me to introduce
Mr. Lewellyn Howland.

37:31.145 --> 37:35.081
And this man is Norris.

37:37.919 --> 37:41.685
These gentlemen are very concerned
about the escape of William Bonney.

37:41.856 --> 37:45.986
-A concern I'm sure you also share.
-He escaped from my jail.

37:47.262 --> 37:49.253
Exactly.

37:55.236 --> 37:58.728
This territory is vast and primitive.

37:59.540 --> 38:05.206
There is money here, growing investments
and political interests.

38:05.380 --> 38:07.314
We must protect these investments...

38:07.482 --> 38:10.246
...so that the area can continue
to prosper and grow.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.581
-I believe you rode with the Kid, didn't you?
-I did.

38:13.755 --> 38:17.748
-Then you must be aware of his moves.
-Well, I know Billy.

38:17.925 --> 38:21.861
-And he ain't exactly predictable.
-Oh, come now, sheriff.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.828
For a man who's half outlaw himself
and still smart enough...

38:24.999 --> 38:29.402
...to be elected sheriff by Chisum and
the big ranchers, I expect better than that.

38:29.737 --> 38:32.137
Can you bring him in,
or should we look elsewhere?

38:32.407 --> 38:34.534
Oh, I can bring him in.

38:34.709 --> 38:39.078
If you and the big peckerheads don't mess
things up by starting another cattle war.

38:39.247 --> 38:44.207
I assure you, Chisum and the others have
been advised to recognize their position.

38:45.486 --> 38:49.889
And in this particular game,
there are only a few plays left.

38:50.191 --> 38:54.218
I'd advise you to grab on to a winning hand
while you have a chance.

38:58.800 --> 39:03.464
We're offering a reward of $1000
for the Kid's capture.

39:05.239 --> 39:07.639
You can have 500 now.

39:08.710 --> 39:11.235
Well, I aim to bring the Kid in.

39:11.746 --> 39:14.078
But until I do...

39:14.248 --> 39:18.685
...better take your $500
and shove it up your ass and set fire to it.

39:42.043 --> 39:44.705
Commendable notion, sheriff.

41:15.470 --> 41:17.131
Eno.

41:18.506 --> 41:20.269
Well, now.

41:32.019 --> 41:36.422
I'm gonna blow the top of your
cow-humping head off, you son of a bitch.

41:36.591 --> 41:38.923
How's it going, Luke?

41:40.161 --> 41:43.096
You are a son of a bitch.

41:43.264 --> 41:45.596
I thought they's getting ready
to trim you.

41:45.766 --> 41:48.667
There's a whole bunch of us
just fixing to ride in.

41:49.303 --> 41:51.498
Well, I saved you all a trip.

41:52.373 --> 41:54.034
Or somebody did.

41:56.677 --> 42:00.579
I figured I'd lay back a few days.
Maybe more.

42:09.357 --> 42:13.885
Well, it sure is pleasurable
seeing you back again, Kid.

42:21.235 --> 42:24.568
-You glad I'm back?
-Welcome home, Billy.

42:25.273 --> 42:27.002
And did you miss me?

42:27.174 --> 42:31.508
So much you had to take up
with that low-down piece, old Hyatt.

42:46.427 --> 42:48.895
Cómo estás, Silva?

42:49.964 --> 42:52.194
Buenos días, Billy.

42:52.366 --> 42:55.631
Now, you're uglier than me.
How's it going, Beaver?

42:58.172 --> 43:03.371
Eno, I thought you boys would be out
in the Nueces or Colorado by now.

43:03.544 --> 43:08.811
Well, I figured to watch you get stretched
but might have knowed you'd show up.

43:08.983 --> 43:11.315
Good thing somebody did.

43:17.658 --> 43:20.684
These four rode in here this morning.

43:36.677 --> 43:38.907
What's your name, boy?

43:41.315 --> 43:44.910
-Alias.
-Alias what?

43:45.086 --> 43:47.281
Alias anything you please.

43:47.455 --> 43:49.753
What do we call you?

43:49.924 --> 43:52.085
Alias.

43:52.259 --> 43:56.218
-Hell, let's call him Alias.
-That's what I'd do.

43:57.498 --> 43:59.830
Alias it is.

44:06.273 --> 44:08.138
Thank you.

44:21.022 --> 44:23.047
My, my.

44:28.129 --> 44:30.427
You boys hungry?

44:36.370 --> 44:39.703
-I didn't catch your name.
-I didn't give it out.

44:40.408 --> 44:43.377
Well, I guess that's why I didn't catch it.

44:44.812 --> 44:46.245
But I know yours.

44:46.881 --> 44:48.508
And that's enough.

44:52.053 --> 44:55.113
Hey, Silva. Do you remember that meeting
with John Jones...

44:55.289 --> 44:59.055
...and that old man they called
U.S. Christmas, down near El Rito?

44:59.226 --> 45:02.957
-That old man they called U.S. Christmas?
-Right. See?

45:06.167 --> 45:10.570
Seems John stepped on one of U.S.'s
boots one night they was both in town.

45:11.472 --> 45:15.636
Old U.S., he'd been out hunting buffalo
for six months.

45:15.810 --> 45:21.214
Now, he was mean and testy
and damn near blind drunk.

45:21.649 --> 45:26.985
He had on a pair of these flat-heeled,
about half-length Wellington boots.

45:27.455 --> 45:30.856
Them boots was the only thing he owned
he put any store in.

45:33.694 --> 45:36.185
And John stepped on one of them.

45:39.533 --> 45:42.661
That old man just stepped back and said:

45:42.837 --> 45:44.964
"Let's get to it."

45:50.611 --> 45:53.944
So John said to U.S.:

45:54.115 --> 45:56.709
"If you're gonna get that riled...

45:56.884 --> 46:00.547
...over a pair of foreign,
lady-looking boots...

46:01.355 --> 46:03.915
...we just might as well
get the ball rolling."

46:05.993 --> 46:08.120
So they went in the middle
of the street.

46:09.163 --> 46:11.597
And they took the 10 steps.

46:12.500 --> 46:16.493
And John put three holes
right through that old man's chest.

46:37.958 --> 46:40.153
I must have known them
from somewhere.

46:43.330 --> 46:45.890
It's too soon for bounty hunters.

46:47.334 --> 46:49.268
Alias?

47:10.925 --> 47:13.018
What the hell?

47:14.862 --> 47:16.557
Garrett?

47:18.399 --> 47:19.957
I thought you was in Lincoln.

47:20.634 --> 47:24.195
-What the hell you doing?
-You get your ass over there, Gate.

47:34.715 --> 47:36.307
Howdy, Cullen.

47:38.452 --> 47:40.647
How do you do, yourself?

47:41.322 --> 47:43.916
What are you doing
with that piece of sheep dip?

47:44.925 --> 47:50.056
I'd like to blow his thieving head off
just for riding through my town.

47:57.037 --> 48:01.599
I ain't paid nobody no never mind.
Been staying in my own good hole.

48:01.775 --> 48:04.938
Fact is, I'm thinking about
going to Texas.

48:05.112 --> 48:07.012
Kid broke out.

48:07.314 --> 48:09.680
Killed Ollinger and Bell.

48:10.251 --> 48:14.381
I thought maybe Gate and some of the boys
might have a sign on him.

48:15.522 --> 48:19.083
Well, I still want him for that train robbery
up at Springer.

48:19.860 --> 48:25.924
Gate's been holed up outside of town here
with Black Harris and Sut Cole, that bunch.

48:26.100 --> 48:28.933
Been meaning to roust them
out of here...

48:29.103 --> 48:31.936
...but somehow or other
I just can't get around to it.

48:32.106 --> 48:35.974
I don't know nothing about the boys,
I don't know nothing about the Kid.

48:37.478 --> 48:41.915
Understand you've been riding for Chisum.

48:44.118 --> 48:46.848
I'd rather be on the outside of the law...

48:47.021 --> 48:52.254
...than packing a badge for that town of
Lincoln and them that's a-running it.

48:56.530 --> 48:57.827
It's a job.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.564
Comes an age in a man's life when...

49:05.339 --> 49:08.672
...he don't wanna spend time
figuring what comes next.

49:08.842 --> 49:11.037
Well, it's gonna cost you some change.

49:11.745 --> 49:14.714
I got to the point where
I don't do nothing for nobody...

49:14.882 --> 49:17.578
...unless there's a piece of gold
attached to it.

49:37.471 --> 49:39.905
One of these days,
when I get my boat built...

49:40.074 --> 49:43.601
...I'm gonna drift out of
this damn territory.

49:46.880 --> 49:50.646
This town's got no hat size nohow.

49:55.456 --> 49:56.923
Mama?

49:57.091 --> 49:59.321
Where'd you put my badge?

50:22.716 --> 50:25.014
I don't like it, Cullen.

50:25.686 --> 50:27.813
This town is not worth it.

50:30.591 --> 50:35.085
Tell you the truth, Mama,
I don't take a shine to it myself.

50:47.341 --> 50:49.241
Anytime you're ready.

51:17.337 --> 51:19.601
Company's coming.

51:19.773 --> 51:21.263
Sheriff Baker.

51:27.915 --> 51:29.576
Hey, Black Harris!

51:29.750 --> 51:31.581
I wanna talk to you!

51:31.752 --> 51:33.515
Whoa, boys.

52:01.648 --> 52:03.115
Black.

52:12.392 --> 52:16.556
I ain't seen the Kid,
if that's what you're sniffing after.

52:17.297 --> 52:22.735
But if it's straight-up one-to-one you want,
then I'm your man.

52:23.871 --> 52:25.600
I'm looking for sign, Black.

52:26.440 --> 52:31.707
Us old boys ought not to be doing this
to each other.

52:33.147 --> 52:36.014
Ain't that many of us left.

52:36.183 --> 52:41.018
Remember?
You and me rode into this county together.

52:42.256 --> 52:44.850
How long ago was that, Pat?

52:46.693 --> 52:49.594
Oh, hell, about 15 years ago.

52:56.036 --> 53:00.370
Pat, I know where the Kid's at.

53:00.874 --> 53:02.842
I'll tell you...

53:03.944 --> 53:07.436
...when you're lying proper
on the ground.

53:19.193 --> 53:21.991
It'll be the last words you ever hear.

55:00.794 --> 55:04.491
Hey, look at that. Look at them turkeys.

55:08.268 --> 55:10.736
Hey, hold them critters, Silva.

55:12.673 --> 55:14.698
Go on, kid, let's get them.

55:33.427 --> 55:34.724
Watch this.

55:39.566 --> 55:42.228
Get in there. Watch this.

55:45.872 --> 55:47.169
Come on, Billy.

55:47.341 --> 55:50.071
-Get out of the way, you son of a bitch.
-Grab him!

55:52.112 --> 55:53.602
Move, Billy.

55:54.881 --> 55:56.280
That's the way. Do it!

55:56.450 --> 55:58.042
Got mine.

55:58.385 --> 56:00.751
Both hands, man.

56:08.562 --> 56:11.360
-What you got there?
-I got me a turkey.

56:30.317 --> 56:31.545
Let me see that bird.

56:31.718 --> 56:35.518
Oh, I could have roped four or five
of them in if it wasn't for you.

56:39.526 --> 56:41.926
Them is Mr. Chisum's cattle.

56:47.067 --> 56:48.659
And this is Chisum's land.

56:57.544 --> 57:00.172
-Where you going with it, Silva?
-Get your rifle.

57:00.480 --> 57:02.641
You'll make a good living cow-thieving.

57:03.784 --> 57:05.547
Give him a good laugh.

59:54.654 --> 59:55.985
You want some coffee?

59:56.790 --> 59:58.724
I could use some.

1:00:02.495 --> 1:00:04.258
Name is Poe.

1:00:04.998 --> 1:00:07.933
John W. Poe out of Fort Griffin, Texas.

1:00:09.903 --> 1:00:13.703
Maybe you saw me last month
in Santa Fe at Governor Wallace's.

1:00:19.446 --> 1:00:22.779
The governor made me a deputy.
I figure he probably told you.

1:00:25.285 --> 1:00:27.685
Already got me a deputy.

1:00:29.623 --> 1:00:31.989
Two's better than one.

1:00:34.127 --> 1:00:38.894
I answer only to the governor,
Mr. Norris and Mr. Howland.

1:00:45.038 --> 1:00:48.201
I heard talk on the trail
the Kid's in Mexico.

1:00:48.375 --> 1:00:50.343
Don't figure to me.

1:00:51.778 --> 1:00:55.236
Most likely, he's trying to get
his old bunch together again.

1:01:11.898 --> 1:01:16.130
-Which way we going?
-I'm going southwest.

1:01:17.270 --> 1:01:19.636
That would be the Chisum ranch.

1:01:20.140 --> 1:01:21.539
Chisum is a fine man.

1:01:22.676 --> 1:01:25.042
Country's gotta make a choice.

1:01:25.211 --> 1:01:29.477
Time's over for drifters and outlaws
and those who got no backbone.

1:01:30.116 --> 1:01:32.016
I'm gonna tell you this once.

1:01:32.185 --> 1:01:34.050
I don't wanna have to say it again.

1:01:34.854 --> 1:01:37.789
This country's getting old,
I aim to get old with it.

1:01:38.725 --> 1:01:40.886
Now, the Kid don't want it that way.

1:01:41.061 --> 1:01:44.292
He might be a better man for it.
I ain't judging.

1:01:44.464 --> 1:01:46.864
But I don't want you explaining
nothing to me.

1:01:47.033 --> 1:01:51.470
And I don't want you saying nothing about
the Kid and nobody else in my damn county.

1:02:11.591 --> 1:02:13.684
Garrett to see you, Mr. Chisum.

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:17.296
-All right. Somebody else try him.
-Yes, sir, Mr. Chisum.

1:02:23.503 --> 1:02:26.768
Mescaleros stole 40 head of horses
last week.

1:02:28.208 --> 1:02:31.268
Yeah, I heard they was
off the reservation.

1:02:33.213 --> 1:02:36.273
And Bonney tried to steal a few head
a couple of weeks ago.

1:02:36.449 --> 1:02:39.907
Well, he says you owe him
$500 back salary.

1:02:40.086 --> 1:02:43.647
He rode for me.
I treated him just like any other man.

1:02:48.194 --> 1:02:52.028
Sheriff, tell me something.
Why did you ride all the way out here?

1:02:52.365 --> 1:02:55.994
-We thought maybe you'd heard something.
-I'll tell you what I heard.

1:02:56.669 --> 1:03:00.571
Billy the Kid is in Tascosa.
Billy the Kid is in Tombstone.

1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:04.904
Billy the Kid is in Mexico, Tularosa,
Socorro, White Oaks.

1:03:05.078 --> 1:03:09.777
And Billy the Kid is at my table
right at this moment...

1:03:09.949 --> 1:03:14.215
...eating tacos and green chili peppers
with my niece, just like old times.

1:03:14.387 --> 1:03:17.754
-You staying for supper?
-No, thanks.

1:03:19.859 --> 1:03:21.520
Mr. Poe?

1:03:23.797 --> 1:03:26.891
I.... Yeah, yes, I could eat.

1:03:27.467 --> 1:03:30.027
Fine. Bunkhouse is right behind
the large barn.

1:03:30.203 --> 1:03:32.569
Men usually eat
when the cook lets them.

1:03:36.142 --> 1:03:40.010
Interesting meeting you, Mr. Poe.
Perhaps I'll see you again some time.

1:03:40.814 --> 1:03:42.679
Glad to be of service, Garrett.

1:03:43.049 --> 1:03:44.880
But don't overuse it.

1:03:49.122 --> 1:03:50.749
I appreciate the loan.

1:03:55.595 --> 1:03:57.586
You gonna get him?

1:04:39.239 --> 1:04:40.501
My friend.

1:04:41.207 --> 1:04:44.233
Buena suerte until I see you.

1:04:44.911 --> 1:04:47.038
Come to Mexico, Billy.

1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.641
People know you're here.

1:04:50.416 --> 1:04:52.008
I say this as a friend.

1:04:52.185 --> 1:04:55.643
In old Mex he ain't gonna be nothing
but another drunken gringo...

1:04:55.822 --> 1:04:59.553
...shitting out chili peppers
and waiting for nothing.

1:05:04.464 --> 1:05:06.864
It's got a good edge.

1:05:12.171 --> 1:05:15.231
There's a lot of land between here
and the border.

1:05:15.408 --> 1:05:17.103
And it's all Chisum's.

1:05:17.277 --> 1:05:21.111
Better keep those sheep moving,
or they're gonna end up on his table.

1:05:23.616 --> 1:05:26.449
I have no quarrel with Chisum.

1:05:26.753 --> 1:05:28.914
It is an old war that is over.

1:05:29.088 --> 1:05:30.988
Let him alone...

1:05:31.758 --> 1:05:34.192
...and he will let you alone.

1:05:35.028 --> 1:05:37.258
Don't you believe it, my friend.

1:05:37.430 --> 1:05:39.728
I must believe it.

1:05:56.916 --> 1:05:58.941
Adiós, Paco.

1:06:03.089 --> 1:06:05.717
You could leave, you could live in Mexico.

1:06:05.959 --> 1:06:08.291
-Could you?
-Yeah.

1:06:08.461 --> 1:06:10.793
I could live anywhere.

1:06:10.964 --> 1:06:13.489
I could leave anywhere too.

1:06:16.769 --> 1:06:20.364
-Have you ever been to California?
-Not yet.

1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:22.867
I ain't either.

1:06:23.676 --> 1:06:27.271
But they're sure pushing on me
to go somewhere.

1:06:29.282 --> 1:06:32.274
Yeah, your leaving would sure
give Garrett some size.

1:06:32.518 --> 1:06:36.420
I reckon he's given me
about all the time he can.

1:06:38.224 --> 1:06:41.660
Mexico might not be bad
for a couple of months.

1:06:42.795 --> 1:06:45.320
Depends on who you are.

1:06:47.767 --> 1:06:49.860
I reckon.

1:07:30.810 --> 1:07:33.506
There's a lot of us who'd ride with you.

1:07:38.918 --> 1:07:41.045
Mexico won't be so bad
for a few months.

1:07:42.355 --> 1:07:44.346
I guess that depends who you are.

1:07:46.826 --> 1:07:48.691
But if I was y'all...

1:07:49.562 --> 1:07:52.087
...I'd be clearing out of here.

1:07:52.432 --> 1:07:55.595
Gonna be some hard times
coming down.

1:07:59.005 --> 1:08:02.099
Remember me to whoever rides by.

1:08:30.837 --> 1:08:34.466
Boy, get some water for these horses.

1:08:49.555 --> 1:08:53.150
-All right about the goddamn--
-Hello there, Lemuel.

1:08:55.928 --> 1:09:01.264
Well, if it ain't the limb
of the law, Patrick J. Garrett.

1:09:01.434 --> 1:09:05.370
Your booze is under the bar,
where I always keep it.

1:09:05.738 --> 1:09:08.935
Shake it up, it's got a little oil on it.

1:09:13.679 --> 1:09:18.139
That's the fairest drink of whiskey
you'll ever throw lip over, boy.

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:22.078
Know you around these parts?

1:09:23.556 --> 1:09:26.218
I ain't ever rode through here before.

1:09:35.301 --> 1:09:39.397
Don't seem the best way
to be tracking a man down.

1:09:39.572 --> 1:09:42.302
They're already talking about you
in Lincoln.

1:09:47.346 --> 1:09:51.009
I calculate you ain't been there
in more than seven weeks.

1:09:59.091 --> 1:10:02.288
Well, when I want somebody
to keep time for me, I'll ask you.

1:10:08.768 --> 1:10:10.929
I'll stay here the night.

1:10:12.438 --> 1:10:16.704
You take that trail east, then south.
I'll pick you up in Roswell. Five days...

1:10:16.876 --> 1:10:18.969
...six at the most.

1:10:24.917 --> 1:10:28.216
You might be able to find something
out there alone.

1:10:37.930 --> 1:10:40.160
Are you getting tired, Garrett?

1:10:40.967 --> 1:10:44.164
Looks like you only got
a couple more days left in you.

1:10:45.504 --> 1:10:49.372
Yeah, well...adiós.

1:10:58.517 --> 1:11:00.280
You want yourself a woman?

1:11:04.023 --> 1:11:08.426
One come in here from Albuquerque,
run a cathouse over there. Name is Bertha.

1:11:09.228 --> 1:11:14.393
Got an ass on her like a $40 cow, and a tit.

1:11:14.567 --> 1:11:17.434
I'd like to see that thing filled
full of tequila.

1:11:18.537 --> 1:11:21.700
Say, you know something,
you can't beat that, can you?

1:11:56.509 --> 1:11:57.999
Howdy, ma'am.

1:11:58.177 --> 1:12:00.077
Mr. Horrell.

1:12:05.518 --> 1:12:08.817
-Hey, Tommy.
-Billy.

1:12:09.355 --> 1:12:12.347
Didn't think we'd be getting to see you.

1:12:13.492 --> 1:12:17.451
I felt obliged to come and pay my respects
before moving on.

1:12:17.630 --> 1:12:19.495
Sit down, Bill.

1:12:28.574 --> 1:12:30.599
You picked a fine time to come, Billy.

1:12:38.284 --> 1:12:40.946
I sure never figured on you
taking on the badge.

1:12:41.387 --> 1:12:45.414
Didn't figure on it myself.
I was just in town being sociable.

1:12:46.359 --> 1:12:49.920
Rode in from Seven Rivers
to watch you hang.

1:12:51.497 --> 1:12:56.332
-Garrett swore me in when you lit out.
-Won't be having no ill talk at my table.

1:12:56.569 --> 1:12:58.093
Fill yourself, Billy.

1:13:05.411 --> 1:13:07.641
Another fried pie?

1:13:08.214 --> 1:13:09.943
Don't mind if I do.

1:13:10.116 --> 1:13:12.676
Never tasted anything so good.

1:13:18.023 --> 1:13:19.786
Thank you, ma'am.

1:13:21.127 --> 1:13:22.651
Billy?

1:13:22.828 --> 1:13:24.420
Tomato.

1:13:29.201 --> 1:13:32.898
I don't suppose you ran into
old Pat, did you, Billy?

1:13:34.373 --> 1:13:35.738
Can't say I did.

1:13:36.942 --> 1:13:39.968
He'll track you down, Billy, and get you.

1:13:40.713 --> 1:13:43.944
Pat Garrett's got more sand than most.

1:13:44.150 --> 1:13:46.948
Yeah, I'm outlawed, for sure.

1:13:47.119 --> 1:13:49.246
Old Alamosa here will see to that.

1:13:52.291 --> 1:13:56.660
It wasn't long ago, I was the law,
riding for Chisum.

1:13:57.062 --> 1:13:59.496
And old Pat was an outlaw.

1:14:03.369 --> 1:14:06.099
The law is a funny thing, ain't it?

1:14:15.247 --> 1:14:17.112
Well, we best get to it.

1:14:21.053 --> 1:14:24.716
Just got through putting up
that new cottonwood door.

1:14:24.890 --> 1:14:27.188
Used the old one for my son, John.

1:14:28.127 --> 1:14:30.823
He got into a shooting with Olin Carroll.

1:14:30.996 --> 1:14:32.987
He's buried out yonder there.

1:14:36.001 --> 1:14:38.629
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Horrell.

1:14:39.672 --> 1:14:41.037
John was a good hand.

1:14:42.708 --> 1:14:44.505
Couldn't shoot, though.

1:14:49.615 --> 1:14:52.379
Harley, you and Lee give me a hand
with this door.

1:15:10.536 --> 1:15:14.063
I don't suppose there's any other
way we could work this out?

1:15:20.079 --> 1:15:22.411
Well, let's get to it.

1:15:22.982 --> 1:15:24.643
Ten steps?

1:15:24.817 --> 1:15:26.910
Suits me.

1:15:27.086 --> 1:15:29.077
You count them.

1:15:39.965 --> 1:15:42.525
You ain't thought of another way,
have you?

1:15:44.336 --> 1:15:46.395
No, I can't come up with nothing.

1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:50.374
Get to it.

1:15:53.279 --> 1:15:59.115
One, two, three, four, five...

1:15:59.285 --> 1:16:01.719
...six, seven, eight--

1:16:21.774 --> 1:16:24.299
That wasn't 10, hoss.

1:16:26.011 --> 1:16:28.536
I never could count.

1:16:31.250 --> 1:16:33.912
At least I'll be remembered.

1:17:33.479 --> 1:17:35.709
Howdy, old-timer.

1:17:37.816 --> 1:17:40.785
You're wasting the best part of your day.

1:17:50.496 --> 1:17:52.123
Hello, Holly.

1:17:53.699 --> 1:17:57.362
-Bit off your graze, ain't you?
-A bit.

1:17:59.405 --> 1:18:02.772
Hell, everybody knows
he's looking for the Kid.

1:18:03.375 --> 1:18:05.935
Everybody knows the Kid
ain't in this territory.

1:18:06.111 --> 1:18:07.510
Nobody's seen him.

1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:10.706
Maybe he be outside there.
I wish he'd come get a drink.

1:18:10.883 --> 1:18:13.147
Get himself a drink?

1:18:13.485 --> 1:18:16.420
Yeah. Well, I had mine.

1:18:16.689 --> 1:18:19.089
No need to run off, Holly.

1:18:34.206 --> 1:18:36.868
He ain't out there, Pat.

1:18:38.844 --> 1:18:42.075
You boys shuck them gun belts.
Let them lay where they fall.

1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:58.059
-You boys carrying wages?
-What kind of wages do you mean?

1:18:58.564 --> 1:19:02.000
Well, any kind of wages.
Thought maybe we'd just have a few...

1:19:02.468 --> 1:19:04.595
...sociable hands.

1:19:16.915 --> 1:19:18.815
Ain't no harm in being sociable.

1:19:18.984 --> 1:19:20.781
Ain't no harm in being sociable.

1:19:26.091 --> 1:19:27.991
Boy...

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:30.958
...go over there to Lemuel
and get that shotgun...

1:19:31.130 --> 1:19:35.123
...he's got his fingers wrapped around
and bring it over to me, stock first.

1:19:35.968 --> 1:19:37.629
Do it!

1:19:41.673 --> 1:19:44.870
It ain't no use, you getting mad.
I wasn't set on using that.

1:19:45.043 --> 1:19:47.705
But those boys have been
patronizing me real well.

1:19:49.081 --> 1:19:52.642
No use getting him mad, old Pat.
We been patronizing him real well.

1:19:56.188 --> 1:19:59.646
Now, I want you to stand over
behind breed here.

1:20:02.995 --> 1:20:08.262
I want you to take the stock of that gun and
rap him smartly on the back of the head.

1:20:08.901 --> 1:20:11.961
You do it, or this bullet
that's going through his chest...

1:20:12.137 --> 1:20:15.903
...is liable to come out the other side
and tickle your private parts.

1:20:16.074 --> 1:20:17.302
Private parts?

1:20:34.359 --> 1:20:36.452
-Lemuel.
-Yeah?

1:20:37.095 --> 1:20:40.758
I want you to drag your fat ass over here
so we can all see you.

1:20:41.433 --> 1:20:44.368
You're crazier than a mule-humping goat.

1:20:44.937 --> 1:20:48.839
Sitting there with all that law crammed
inside of you, busting to get out.

1:20:50.709 --> 1:20:54.372
I wouldn't give a sweet jerk in hell
if the Kid did lay you out.

1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:59.417
You used to be just like a daddy
to that boy.

1:21:00.419 --> 1:21:02.182
Boy.

1:21:07.426 --> 1:21:09.257
Come over here.

1:21:11.630 --> 1:21:15.691
I want you to take Lemuel's hat
and stuff it down over his eyes, gentle-like.

1:21:16.602 --> 1:21:20.368
Those eyes ain't seen nothing but bad
since he's been in this territory.

1:21:21.173 --> 1:21:23.334
And I'm looking right smack-dab at it.

1:21:33.385 --> 1:21:36.684
Now, I want you to go over there
to that shelf of airtights...

1:21:37.456 --> 1:21:42.120
...and give us a nice read,
loud enough for us all to hear.

1:21:53.605 --> 1:21:55.470
Let's hear it!

1:21:56.375 --> 1:21:59.344
"Beans. Beans.

1:21:59.611 --> 1:22:00.942
Spinach.

1:22:01.113 --> 1:22:03.946
Eastern plums.

1:22:04.116 --> 1:22:08.018
Beans. Beef stew. Salmon."

1:22:08.186 --> 1:22:10.177
-Two is a better game.
-"Pears."

1:22:10.589 --> 1:22:15.083
Listen, Pat, we haven't done nothing.

1:22:15.327 --> 1:22:20.492
All we did was come in
and wet ourselves down.

1:22:22.134 --> 1:22:25.035
-"Spinach."
-Take it right from the bottle, Holly.

1:22:25.437 --> 1:22:26.870
"Beef stew."

1:22:27.372 --> 1:22:30.364
No need to stand on manners
around here.

1:22:33.612 --> 1:22:36.581
No, no, no.
Go ahead, have another one there.

1:22:37.482 --> 1:22:39.677
"Climax tobacco."

1:22:40.752 --> 1:22:42.617
Just keep on going there.

1:22:43.355 --> 1:22:47.451
"AMK fine quality tomatoes."

1:22:47.859 --> 1:22:51.795
He's trying to drown you. That's what.
Trying to get his bark back on him.

1:22:52.064 --> 1:22:54.862
Thinks it's going to make him young,
like the Kid.

1:22:55.033 --> 1:22:56.591
"AMK salmon.

1:22:57.536 --> 1:23:00.664
Beans. Spinach and beans.

1:23:00.839 --> 1:23:02.898
Baked beans.

1:23:04.242 --> 1:23:05.266
Beans."

1:23:05.444 --> 1:23:11.144
-Boy, this sure lights up and kill you.
-"Baked beans.

1:23:12.617 --> 1:23:14.209
Beans."

1:23:20.525 --> 1:23:22.015
"Quality."

1:23:26.765 --> 1:23:28.699
"Quality."

1:23:30.402 --> 1:23:32.393
"Beef stew."

1:23:36.775 --> 1:23:38.868
Tell me, Pat.

1:23:39.311 --> 1:23:43.441
Are you afraid to take it
to the Kid, or what?

1:23:44.549 --> 1:23:47.211
Ever since you and the Kid
have been together...

1:23:47.386 --> 1:23:52.949
...you've just been a little short
of supplies, you know what I mean?

1:23:55.293 --> 1:23:57.261
"Lima beans."

1:23:57.496 --> 1:23:59.123
Oh, hell.

1:24:01.767 --> 1:24:03.928
I don't care about either one of you.

1:24:04.770 --> 1:24:09.036
"Lard. Quality-- Quality salmon."

1:24:33.498 --> 1:24:37.696
"Plums. Beans. Tomatoes."

1:24:37.869 --> 1:24:41.270
You just made me have a bowel
movement in my britches, Garrett.

1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:43.670
I ain't gonna never forgive you for this.

1:24:43.842 --> 1:24:46.811
"Succotash. Beets.

1:24:47.345 --> 1:24:49.404
Spinach."

1:24:50.115 --> 1:24:51.776
Boy.

1:24:53.518 --> 1:24:54.780
When you see Billy...

1:24:58.490 --> 1:25:03.587
...tell him we had a little drink together.

1:25:21.580 --> 1:25:22.945
No!

1:25:23.682 --> 1:25:25.172
No!

1:25:25.350 --> 1:25:27.375
No. No.

1:25:32.290 --> 1:25:33.951
It's ready.

1:25:50.642 --> 1:25:52.576
Jesus Christ!

1:25:53.879 --> 1:25:55.141
You working for Chisum?

1:25:56.181 --> 1:25:58.911
Yeah. We're working for him.

1:26:04.823 --> 1:26:07.257
Hello, Paco.

1:26:20.172 --> 1:26:22.834
I will tell you about a house
that I want to build.

1:26:24.109 --> 1:26:25.633
No, not here.

1:26:25.810 --> 1:26:27.607
For us, amigo.

1:26:28.313 --> 1:26:30.713
It will be on the other side.

1:26:30.882 --> 1:26:32.907
In old Mex.

1:26:33.218 --> 1:26:35.846
I will sell my sheep.

1:26:36.388 --> 1:26:39.619
And I will build the adobe bridge myself.

1:26:39.791 --> 1:26:41.691
You know, Billy...

1:26:42.694 --> 1:26:44.662
...I'll put a vine...

1:26:44.829 --> 1:26:47.662
...a grapevine out on the veranda...

1:26:47.832 --> 1:26:50.300
...and I will have three chairs...

1:26:50.635 --> 1:26:53.331
...and I will sit in the middle one.

1:26:53.805 --> 1:26:56.740
And anyone who doesn't do right...

1:26:56.908 --> 1:27:00.400
...according to nature and my mother...

1:27:00.579 --> 1:27:03.047
...I will blow his head off.

1:27:03.815 --> 1:27:05.214
Billy....

1:27:09.621 --> 1:27:11.953
Cómo te sientes tú, Billy?

1:27:22.867 --> 1:27:24.732
Well, that ties it.

1:27:24.903 --> 1:27:26.996
I'm going back.

1:28:23.361 --> 1:28:25.420
Look who's here.

1:28:25.864 --> 1:28:27.923
Hey, look who's here!

1:28:37.776 --> 1:28:41.007
I was hoping that was you
as soon as I seen your dust.

1:28:41.479 --> 1:28:43.811
Well, I was hoping that was you.

1:28:44.916 --> 1:28:47.350
I ain't shut of this country yet.

1:28:47.519 --> 1:28:49.487
I should have knowed better.

1:28:50.488 --> 1:28:52.012
Beaver.

1:28:52.590 --> 1:28:54.387
Goddamn glad to see you, buddy.

1:28:55.660 --> 1:29:00.495
You boys look grim. You need somebody
back here to spur your flanks, don't you?

1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:04.769
You just give us the word.
There's enough of us left.

1:29:05.870 --> 1:29:08.031
Nobody's running us off.

1:29:10.141 --> 1:29:11.938
Not Garrett...

1:29:12.911 --> 1:29:14.378
...Chisum...

1:29:14.746 --> 1:29:17.374
...or that goddamn governor.

1:29:20.819 --> 1:29:23.049
Chisum killed Paco.

1:29:34.466 --> 1:29:36.127
Hello, Rupert.

1:29:39.804 --> 1:29:41.294
Take your old room.

1:29:41.473 --> 1:29:42.804
Key's in the door.

1:29:42.974 --> 1:29:44.771
Oh, Rupert...

1:29:45.176 --> 1:29:48.304
...what ladies do you have
hosting for you nowadays?

1:29:54.119 --> 1:29:58.317
We just got some sort of an octoroon
from south Texas...

1:29:58.490 --> 1:30:01.516
...and there's Ruthie Lee and Pauline.

1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:04.824
Well, I'll be up in Ruthie Lee's room.

1:30:05.296 --> 1:30:06.786
She won't want to see you.

1:30:06.965 --> 1:30:09.365
She's been with the Kid
more than a few times.

1:30:09.534 --> 1:30:11.297
Well, send her up anyway.

1:30:12.370 --> 1:30:13.632
You want another one?

1:30:13.805 --> 1:30:15.773
I don't care who you send up, Rupert.

1:30:15.940 --> 1:30:19.569
Just make sure that Ruthie Lee's
part of the package.

1:30:27.685 --> 1:30:29.118
Come in.

1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:45.031
-Hello, Ruthie.
-Which way do you wanna go?

1:30:47.839 --> 1:30:49.329
I don't know yet.

1:31:00.051 --> 1:31:02.110
Gotta ask a few questions first.

1:31:04.222 --> 1:31:07.783
He was here a few weeks ago.
I don't know where he went.

1:31:11.229 --> 1:31:13.527
Better do better than that, Ruthie.

1:31:19.904 --> 1:31:24.136
You're gonna have to do me one more time,
because I owe the Kid that much.

1:31:34.419 --> 1:31:36.353
Now you tell me.

1:31:38.456 --> 1:31:40.321
Fort Sumner.

1:32:21.432 --> 1:32:23.127
Excuse me.

1:32:26.838 --> 1:32:29.068
Clean it off real good, now.

1:32:39.584 --> 1:32:41.848
We're getting to the best part.

1:32:42.754 --> 1:32:46.155
You gotta pull hard there.
They been on for a long time.

1:32:48.192 --> 1:32:49.989
Yeah.

1:32:55.066 --> 1:32:57.762
Oh, yes. How is that tub?

1:32:59.504 --> 1:33:01.563
Having a little trouble there, girls?

1:33:05.443 --> 1:33:07.035
Jesus.

1:34:00.732 --> 1:34:02.029
What room is Garrett in?

1:34:03.901 --> 1:34:05.698
End of the hall.

1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:16.669
Garrett?

1:34:19.917 --> 1:34:22.181
Come on in. The door's not locked.

1:34:27.825 --> 1:34:29.452
Well, where's he at?

1:34:31.663 --> 1:34:33.187
Fort Sumner.

1:34:33.765 --> 1:34:36.529
Yeah, well, I don't wanna hear about that.

1:34:38.469 --> 1:34:40.460
If you don't get him, I'm going to.

1:34:44.442 --> 1:34:48.105
Go down to the sheriff's office
and find Kip McKinney.

1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:50.805
Tell him to meet me downstairs.

1:34:50.982 --> 1:34:53.917
Don't say nothing about nothing.

1:35:27.685 --> 1:35:29.448
Thank you, Rupert.

1:35:38.262 --> 1:35:40.230
Your jail empty?

1:35:41.132 --> 1:35:43.600
I recollect that it is.

1:35:43.768 --> 1:35:46.498
-Who's your deputy?
-Sack Oliver.

1:35:47.705 --> 1:35:49.866
Well, I got the girls upstairs.

1:35:50.041 --> 1:35:51.167
Locked up.

1:35:54.579 --> 1:35:58.037
Take the girls over to see old Sack Oliver.

1:35:59.150 --> 1:36:00.947
Give him the key.

1:36:02.053 --> 1:36:04.283
Go on, give him the key.

1:36:11.395 --> 1:36:15.263
And then bring Mr. McKinney's horse back.
All right, Poe?

1:36:29.547 --> 1:36:31.981
Where are we going anyway?

1:36:32.683 --> 1:36:34.617
Fort Sumner.

1:36:34.786 --> 1:36:37.846
There ain't nothing out there
but some old cattle thieves.

1:36:41.359 --> 1:36:44.658
Well, there's a couple
of young ones there too.

1:36:56.707 --> 1:36:59.073
No, I ain't going.

1:37:04.649 --> 1:37:06.674
You owe it to me.

1:37:07.418 --> 1:37:09.818
I do? For what?

1:37:09.987 --> 1:37:13.252
For not killing you over at Rosewater...

1:37:13.624 --> 1:37:16.388
...for getting you this job...

1:37:17.061 --> 1:37:19.325
...and not seeing you run out of here.

1:37:19.497 --> 1:37:23.399
For pulling you out of that snowdrift
up at Chamas.

1:37:24.268 --> 1:37:27.465
For coldcocking you over at
Stillwater's saloon last fall...

1:37:27.638 --> 1:37:31.699
...and saving you from Rabbit Owen's
biting off your ear and from just...

1:37:32.376 --> 1:37:35.903
...putting up with you for a hell of a lot
longer than I ought to.

1:37:41.219 --> 1:37:42.777
Yeah.

1:37:44.155 --> 1:37:45.986
Well...

1:37:46.791 --> 1:37:50.249
...I hope they spell my name right
in the papers.

1:38:17.855 --> 1:38:19.083
Billy.

1:38:20.391 --> 1:38:22.518
Cut the dust.

1:38:38.809 --> 1:38:40.174
He's coming in, Billy.

1:38:45.416 --> 1:38:47.213
Yeah, I reckon.

1:38:48.819 --> 1:38:51.686
Maybe he wants to have a drink with me.

1:39:24.255 --> 1:39:26.485
I'd just as soon ride in,
get it over with.

1:39:26.657 --> 1:39:28.852
He ain't gonna be there anyway.

1:39:29.393 --> 1:39:32.226
Hell, I don't have nothing
against the Kid...

1:39:32.697 --> 1:39:35.996
...saving maybe he killed J.W. Bell.

1:39:36.167 --> 1:39:37.794
Yeah.

1:39:38.269 --> 1:39:40.601
I sure did like J.W.

1:39:40.771 --> 1:39:44.605
We'll meet up on the other side of the fort,
at old Pete Maxwell's place.

1:39:44.775 --> 1:39:46.709
I know old Pete.

1:40:37.228 --> 1:40:39.162
Hello, Pete.

1:40:45.603 --> 1:40:48.003
Heard you were back.

1:40:53.010 --> 1:40:54.841
Obliged.

1:40:59.784 --> 1:41:03.049
We'd like to bed down
in your extra bunk.

1:41:06.891 --> 1:41:10.452
No reason not to. I got no need for it.

1:41:14.565 --> 1:41:16.328
Been on any drives?

1:41:17.802 --> 1:41:19.463
No.

1:41:23.274 --> 1:41:24.969
I recollect the time...

1:41:25.342 --> 1:41:27.810
...Toddy Sparks got his horse stole.

1:41:29.146 --> 1:41:31.046
Jace Summers stole it.

1:41:31.215 --> 1:41:33.615
Just up and stole it.

1:41:34.452 --> 1:41:36.784
It was up by Del Rio.

1:41:38.923 --> 1:41:41.323
Old Toddy got even, though.

1:41:41.492 --> 1:41:43.585
He sure did.

1:41:45.262 --> 1:41:48.493
Put a rattler in Jace's blanket.

1:41:50.734 --> 1:41:53.294
Bit him through the neck.

1:41:55.172 --> 1:41:57.834
Buried him in a thunderstorm.

1:41:58.209 --> 1:42:01.269
Summer of '71 it was.

1:43:17.888 --> 1:43:20.516
Man, what are you,
some kind of frog-watcher?

1:43:20.691 --> 1:43:22.386
Take it easy. Wrong room.

1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:24.858
You're goddamn right
you got the wrong room.

1:43:25.062 --> 1:43:27.758
-Who in the hell you looking for?
-Somebody else.

1:43:28.165 --> 1:43:29.598
What somebody else?

1:44:22.886 --> 1:44:24.581
It's cold.

1:44:27.558 --> 1:44:29.822
It's cold.

1:44:34.298 --> 1:44:36.232
Hello, Will.

1:44:37.067 --> 1:44:38.728
Hello, sheriff.

1:44:46.143 --> 1:44:48.873
You finally figured it out, huh?

1:44:53.450 --> 1:44:55.680
Go on, get it over with.

1:45:25.749 --> 1:45:27.216
Jesus.

1:45:44.301 --> 1:45:46.030
Jesus.

1:45:48.706 --> 1:45:50.435
Jesus.

1:46:57.574 --> 1:46:59.735
I'm hungry.

1:46:59.910 --> 1:47:01.434
I'll get you something.

1:47:01.612 --> 1:47:05.275
No, I'll just see what Pete's got out
in the cooler.

1:48:17.654 --> 1:48:20.521
That's the Kid, Tex. Right there.

1:48:21.758 --> 1:48:23.817
Go on, shoot him. Go on, shoot him.

1:48:47.217 --> 1:48:50.015
Go on, shoot him.

1:48:52.856 --> 1:48:54.084
Who's that?

1:48:57.461 --> 1:48:58.689
Who the hell are you?

1:49:03.667 --> 1:49:05.191
Hello, Pete.

1:49:07.104 --> 1:49:08.435
Evening, Pat.

1:49:09.573 --> 1:49:12.804
Easy. We come to see Pete Maxwell.

1:49:14.411 --> 1:49:16.936
You chickenshit bastard.

1:49:23.220 --> 1:49:25.381
Hey, Pete, who's that out there?

1:50:28.318 --> 1:50:29.717
I want his trigger finger!

1:50:29.987 --> 1:50:34.515
I want it cut off! I want it nailed to a post!
Then I want him taken back to Lincoln!

1:50:35.826 --> 1:50:37.418
No!
