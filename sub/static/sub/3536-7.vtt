WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:03.294
Carroll was convicted
in 2004

00:03.433 --> 00:05.883
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.995 --> 00:07.477
We need
you in Virginia, Ryan.

00:07.593 --> 00:08.726
I'm not an agent anymore.

00:08.845 --> 00:11.115
You caught Carroll. No one
knows him like you do.

00:11.246 --> 00:12.959
So what's my sequel
about, Joe?

00:13.082 --> 00:14.884
We're gonna
write this together, Ryan...

00:15.061 --> 00:16.018
Ohh!

00:16.711 --> 00:19.221
Even though you
slept with my wife.

00:19.376 --> 00:22.692
I have so many surprises
waiting for you.

00:23.007 --> 00:25.454
Olivia, I require
legal counsel.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.500
Do not bring me
into this any further.

00:27.635 --> 00:29.368
We're just
getting started.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.967
If you want to see
Joey, get in now.

00:33.077 --> 00:34.668
I was told that I would see my son.
Where is he?

00:34.782 --> 00:36.188
You don't have to be
afraid of me, Claire.

00:36.323 --> 00:37.491
You have to trust me.

00:37.636 --> 00:39.774
Hey, Joey.
Remember me?

00:39.968 --> 00:42.072
Do not move.

00:44.439 --> 00:45.645
Be right back.

00:46.803 --> 00:48.620
Place is
surrounded by cops.

00:48.723 --> 00:49.763
No way out.

00:49.862 --> 00:51.541
Come on.
We got to go.

00:51.653 --> 00:53.200
What's taking her
so long?

00:53.313 --> 00:54.186
I looked all over
the place!

00:54.289 --> 00:55.561
She and Joey
are both gone.

00:56.073 --> 00:57.139
Ugh!

00:57.246 --> 00:58.244
Don't move!

00:58.352 --> 00:59.762
Joey, we're here
to help you.

01:00.888 --> 01:02.983
I'm with Roderick.
Let's go.

01:03.084 --> 01:04.107
Stop right there!

01:04.187 --> 01:06.802
No. Joey, no! Wait!

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.299 --> 01:29.885
Where are we?

01:32.053 --> 01:34.092
I thought we were
going to see my mom.

01:34.217 --> 01:35.431
We are,

01:35.833 --> 01:37.541
but I need to meet
a friend first.

01:37.646 --> 01:39.456
We have to meet
your friend here?

01:39.649 --> 01:42.427
Yes. He's gonna
help us, okay?

01:42.541 --> 01:43.539
We won't be long.

01:43.658 --> 01:44.834
What about
Jacob and Paul?

01:44.932 --> 01:46.493
Aren't they
coming, too?

01:48.086 --> 01:49.511
I don't know.

01:50.835 --> 01:52.058
What about
all the bad guys?

01:52.164 --> 01:53.514
Aren't they still
looking for us?

01:53.621 --> 01:55.174
- No.
- How do you know?

01:55.289 --> 01:56.833
Joey, please stop.

02:00.697 --> 02:02.441
Everything's
gonna be okay.

02:03.546 --> 02:05.107
Promise.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.382
Hello?

02:17.793 --> 02:19.468
I've been waiting
for you.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.449
I was told
to come here.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.117
I know.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.128
It's about time
you showed up.

02:31.546 --> 02:33.142
My name is Bo.

02:34.009 --> 02:35.688
Go pull your truck
in there.

02:36.248 --> 02:38.100
I have to go use
the bathroom.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.280
We've been driving
all night.

02:41.437 --> 02:42.891
You got
a little boys' room?

02:44.056 --> 02:45.884
Through the office.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.882
Go ahead, Joey.

03:18.444 --> 03:20.090
Hello?

03:47.734 --> 03:49.413
Please! Please!

03:49.534 --> 03:50.706
Help me, please.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.229
Don't leave me here.

03:52.352 --> 03:54.653
Don't leave me.
Please come back!

03:54.855 --> 03:57.465
Come back, come back,
come back!

04:07.953 --> 04:10.099
Guards! Guards!
Help!

04:10.264 --> 04:12.480
Hey.
Come on, come on.

04:14.377 --> 04:17.611
Ryan Hardy's assault
resulted in 3 broken fingers.

04:17.719 --> 04:18.940
As I'm sure you're
aware, warden,

04:19.045 --> 04:20.702
this is a clear violation
of my client's

04:20.819 --> 04:22.174
eighth amendment rights.

04:22.297 --> 04:23.290
I'm aware.

04:23.427 --> 04:25.080
The FBI's behavior
was unwarranted.

04:25.184 --> 04:26.544
We have case law
precedence,

04:26.685 --> 04:28.929
federal tort
and civil liberties claims.

04:29.042 --> 04:32.399
Just exactly what do
you want, Miss Warren?

04:32.505 --> 04:34.764
I'll let my client
tell you himself.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.714
Mr. Carroll.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.612
First,
Warden Montero

04:40.743 --> 04:44.470
and other important
people, thank you.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.088
Thank you for
allowing me

04:46.203 --> 04:50.194
the opportunity to
share the injustices

04:50.336 --> 04:55.436
that have been
inflicted upon me.

04:58.722 --> 05:00.095
He said
his name was Charlie,

05:00.221 --> 05:02.983
and he told me that
he was hired to follow me

05:03.102 --> 05:04.631
and to report
back to Joe.

05:04.753 --> 05:06.034
He had photos and video,

05:06.158 --> 05:09.586
and he-- he said he was
gonna take me to Joey.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.133
And you
believed him.

05:11.307 --> 05:12.769
Yes, I did.

05:13.223 --> 05:14.573
He had this honor
about him

05:14.672 --> 05:16.585
like hew as living up
to some code of conduct,

05:16.696 --> 05:18.178
definitely military.

05:21.665 --> 05:24.359
Um, Marines or army
or something.

05:24.447 --> 05:25.651
He said that he was
waiting to hear

05:25.747 --> 05:27.893
from someone
named Roderick for orders.

05:28.004 --> 05:29.371
Tea.

05:31.768 --> 05:32.977
Thank you.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.667
Roderick?

05:34.902 --> 05:36.787
Um, yeah. I'm sure
it's an alias.

05:37.565 --> 05:39.087
Roderick Usher--
it's from Poe's

05:39.161 --> 05:40.216
"Fall Of The House
Of Usher."

05:40.322 --> 05:41.739
When we were
at the farmhouse,

05:41.835 --> 05:43.491
Emma got a call
from this Roderick.

05:43.617 --> 05:44.884
Cult leaders often have
a second in command,

05:45.003 --> 05:48.016
someone to oversee,
manages the cult.

05:48.129 --> 05:50.511
Do you even know how many
people are involved in this?

05:51.411 --> 05:53.989
I mean, are we talking
fans or prison groupies

05:54.099 --> 05:56.749
or people with serious
mental disorders?

05:56.868 --> 05:58.310
And do we know how many
of them have killed?

05:58.413 --> 05:59.623
Truth is,
we don't know,

05:59.734 --> 06:00.736
but it's a lot bigger
than we thought,

06:00.842 --> 06:01.858
more pervasive.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.699
Miss Matthews, can I count
on you not to engage

06:03.820 --> 06:05.591
with any more
of Joe's followers?

06:05.694 --> 06:06.999
No, you can't,

06:07.122 --> 06:09.365
not any more than I can count
on you to find my son.

06:09.605 --> 06:11.323
Claire...

06:11.914 --> 06:14.085
I don't know what I would
do in your situation,

06:14.617 --> 06:16.865
so I will just ask you
to inform us

06:16.985 --> 06:19.339
if anyone makes contact
with you again.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.775
You have to find
this guy-- Charlie.

06:29.896 --> 06:30.652
I'm-- I'm sorry.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.431
Don't.
Just find him.

06:32.586 --> 06:34.127
He knows where
they took Joey.

06:49.170 --> 06:50.860
When is Charlie coming?

07:05.056 --> 07:06.525
There you are.

07:07.638 --> 07:09.082
You okay?

07:12.720 --> 07:15.172
Hey. Everything
okay, honey?

07:15.272 --> 07:16.261
There was a girl.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.240
She's locked
in a cage back there.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.750
She's scared.
We have to help her.

07:19.864 --> 07:21.933
- There's a what?
- We have to help her.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.498
You're not supposed
to go back there!

07:26.430 --> 07:28.205
She's none
of your business.

07:32.049 --> 07:36.115
You don't go
back there, okay?

07:38.029 --> 07:39.467
You understand?

07:46.678 --> 07:48.137
Stay right here.

07:49.881 --> 07:51.884
Why do you have
a girl in a cage?

07:52.538 --> 07:53.876
Is there something
that I should know about?

07:54.014 --> 07:55.937
It's none of your
business neither.

07:58.659 --> 08:00.582
Why don't
we just wait?

08:01.569 --> 08:05.010
Less talking
and... just wait.

08:08.968 --> 08:10.142
You can't
do this, Gene.

08:10.259 --> 08:12.205
I've already discussed
it with Director Franklin.

08:13.449 --> 08:16.196
I understand that some lines
may have been crossed,

08:16.314 --> 08:17.879
but this doesn't
make any sense.

08:17.984 --> 08:19.559
We're talking about a
convicted serial killer here.

08:19.682 --> 08:22.245
Carroll makes a convincing
case for prison abuse.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.503
I do not need
that kind of liability!

08:24.621 --> 08:25.892
What's going on here?

08:26.030 --> 08:27.556
Look. Just give
me the time

08:27.699 --> 08:28.963
to speak with
the Justice Department,

08:29.085 --> 08:30.372
find a better
alternative.

08:30.497 --> 08:32.312
It's too late for that.
Excuse me.

08:32.423 --> 08:34.056
And I'd suggest you do
something about this man

08:34.195 --> 08:35.953
before he does
more damage.

08:36.597 --> 08:38.736
This is on you,
Mr. Hardy.

08:40.293 --> 08:41.970
What is he talking about?
What's going on?

08:42.203 --> 08:43.885
The warden just
granted Joe Carroll's

08:43.999 --> 08:45.512
request
for a transfer.

08:45.598 --> 08:46.437
He's leaving.

08:46.548 --> 08:47.600
What? When?

08:47.698 --> 08:48.572
Immediately.

08:48.659 --> 08:50.152
They're preparing
to move him now.

09:02.556 --> 09:05.219
Joe Carroll, you've been
remanded into the custody

09:05.354 --> 09:07.221
of the Jesup County federal
correctional facility

09:07.340 --> 09:08.752
of the state
of Georgia.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.982
You mind giving us
the room?

09:15.685 --> 09:17.326
He's all yours.

09:21.382 --> 09:23.687
I don't believe we've
had the pleasure.

09:24.905 --> 09:26.124
Oh! Ryan.

09:26.216 --> 09:28.034
Come for your
farewell visit.

09:28.703 --> 09:29.969
Thanks.

09:34.026 --> 09:34.932
Well, I couldn't
let you leave

09:35.070 --> 09:36.903
without saying
a proper good-bye.

09:37.524 --> 09:39.063
So why
the transfer, Joe?

09:40.037 --> 09:42.119
What's in Georgia,
huh?

09:42.229 --> 09:43.720
You have friends
there?

09:44.696 --> 09:46.400
Is that where
the cult is,

09:46.703 --> 09:48.490
your good buddy
Roderick?

09:48.601 --> 09:51.369
Roderick? Roderick. No.

09:51.482 --> 09:54.220
Sorry. Name doesn't
ring a bell.

09:54.339 --> 09:55.973
Tell me about Claire.

09:56.270 --> 10:00.371
How did she react when you
failed to rescue our son?

10:00.491 --> 10:01.780
Was she upset?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.889
Has she rejected
you yet?

10:04.848 --> 10:06.463
It's okay, Ryan.

10:06.575 --> 10:09.500
Every great love
must be tested after all.

10:09.624 --> 10:11.538
- You know, that's strange.
- Hmm?

10:12.440 --> 10:13.887
I say the name Roderick,

10:14.030 --> 10:16.239
and you immediately
change the subject.

10:16.473 --> 10:20.474
Hmm. I'm so gonna
miss these little chats.

10:23.242 --> 10:25.295
We need to take him
down for processing.

10:38.583 --> 10:39.973
Good-bye, Ryan.

10:41.238 --> 10:42.607
I want to go.
I really think

10:42.740 --> 10:44.293
that I should be
supervising the transfer.

10:44.418 --> 10:46.562
The US Marshals are
supervising the transfer.

10:46.699 --> 10:48.098
They agreed to let me
accompany them.

10:48.207 --> 10:49.210
No. Listen.
I got to be there.

10:49.331 --> 10:50.769
You can't.

10:50.902 --> 10:55.279
Look. I know that we are
all upset and disappointed

10:55.391 --> 10:57.112
about what happened
at the farmhouse,

10:58.219 --> 10:59.761
but we got this.

11:00.755 --> 11:03.002
I will make sure
nothing goes wrong.

11:13.177 --> 11:14.532
Mike.

11:16.304 --> 11:17.390
What's up?

11:18.506 --> 11:20.969
I need you to look
into Warden Montero.

11:21.542 --> 11:23.096
You think the warden's
been compromised?

11:23.210 --> 11:24.087
I don't know
what to think,

11:24.209 --> 11:26.625
- but something's not right.
- Hmm.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.435
So how do you
know Roderick?

11:41.107 --> 11:43.480
I do things for him
from time to time.

11:43.965 --> 11:45.396
What kind of things?

11:56.394 --> 11:58.033
Are you
still in there?

11:58.523 --> 12:00.320
I'm Joey.
I've got the keys.

12:00.425 --> 12:01.526
Let me get you out.

12:01.657 --> 12:03.590
Joey, I'm Dana.

12:03.699 --> 12:04.992
Nice to meet you.

12:06.473 --> 12:07.960
I knew you'd come back.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.310
Do you know
Joe Carroll?

12:15.416 --> 12:16.975
I know who he is,

12:17.561 --> 12:19.623
but I'm not a part
of his little club.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.097
Where's the kid?

12:26.352 --> 12:27.814
Joey?

12:28.829 --> 12:30.340
Joey?

12:33.601 --> 12:35.212
- Please hurry.
- I am.

12:35.673 --> 12:36.983
You-- you can do it.

12:39.874 --> 12:42.107
I'm trying...
Got it!

12:47.127 --> 12:48.410
Come on.

12:52.723 --> 12:54.037
Oh. What are you
waiting for?

12:54.169 --> 12:55.341
Let's go.

13:07.323 --> 13:08.887
What did you
just do?

13:09.125 --> 13:10.497
Why'd you do that?

13:12.004 --> 13:14.139
Why did you do that?!

13:16.023 --> 13:17.372
You come back here!

13:18.199 --> 13:20.343
Ugh!

13:23.212 --> 13:24.458
Come here!

13:24.968 --> 13:26.561
Come back here!

13:32.132 --> 13:33.559
Where are you?!

13:44.005 --> 13:45.677
Joey!

13:52.547 --> 13:54.274
All right, Joey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:58.284 --> 14:00.745
I'm not gonna hurt you, Joey.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.816
I told you not
to go back there!

14:07.924 --> 14:10.349
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

14:10.446 --> 14:12.134
Touch him again,
and you're dead!

14:16.134 --> 14:17.583
Joey, come here.

14:18.285 --> 14:19.275
Unh!

14:21.207 --> 14:22.686
Denise!

14:23.503 --> 14:25.063
Oh! Joey, run!

14:26.518 --> 14:28.764
Aah! Noooo!

14:33.790 --> 14:35.549
What the hell
is going on?

15:15.044 --> 15:16.356
Everything okay
out there?

15:16.475 --> 15:17.654
All set.

15:17.821 --> 15:19.572
Chopper's inbound now.

15:21.293 --> 15:23.764
Okay. They're locking him
in the transport vehicle.

15:28.321 --> 15:29.696
Prisoner is
in the transport.

15:29.793 --> 15:31.235
Securing
all doors now.

16:00.899 --> 16:02.150
Hey. What'd you
find out?

16:02.658 --> 16:04.088
Well, he looks clean.

16:04.359 --> 16:05.693
No known association
with anybody

16:05.809 --> 16:06.999
that's ever visited
Joe Carroll,

16:07.108 --> 16:08.709
but I did find
one thing.

16:08.895 --> 16:11.265
The warden's got a teenage
daughter enrolled in college.

16:13.709 --> 16:15.343
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.325
Yeah.

16:17.535 --> 16:18.661
Warden Montero.

16:18.942 --> 16:20.198
I really don't
have time, Hardy.

16:20.304 --> 16:22.162
I have a question about
Joe Carroll's transfer.

16:22.269 --> 16:23.748
We've already been
through this.

16:23.853 --> 16:24.667
Humor us.

16:24.765 --> 16:26.004
You're the reason
that man got transferred,

16:26.101 --> 16:26.815
not me.

16:26.895 --> 16:28.484
Okay. So this has
nothing to do

16:28.578 --> 16:30.114
with your
daughter Dana.

16:30.335 --> 16:31.317
Where is she,
warden?

16:31.417 --> 16:32.849
She's in school.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.703
Hoberman college.

16:34.811 --> 16:35.677
That's right.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.631
She hasn't been to class
in over two days.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.096
This morning,
her boyfriend filed

16:39.212 --> 16:40.921
a missing persons report
with campus security.

16:41.028 --> 16:41.817
Well, I wasn't
aware of that.

16:41.929 --> 16:42.709
I'll look into it
right away.

16:42.811 --> 16:44.873
Joe Carroll's people
threatened you, didn't they?

16:45.082 --> 16:47.005
They forced you to authorize
his transfer, huh?

16:47.114 --> 16:49.830
Mr. Hardy, I understand
that you're here

16:49.951 --> 16:51.248
at the behest of the FBI,

16:51.351 --> 16:52.805
but you're skating
on very thin ice.

16:52.911 --> 16:56.139
Do not push me.

17:03.949 --> 17:05.925
- You buying it?
- Not for a second.

17:06.044 --> 17:07.281
I want to know
everything about him,

17:07.396 --> 17:09.288
where he goes, who he
talks to, everything.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.656
What's taking
so long?

17:19.223 --> 17:21.491
We're waiting for word
that it's safe to move.

17:21.604 --> 17:23.348
Why do we have to
wait here?

17:23.792 --> 17:26.085
What about that guy Bo?

17:26.220 --> 17:27.747
Is he part of this?

17:28.718 --> 17:29.899
When we set up
the web site,

17:30.008 --> 17:31.618
we found a lot
of people like Bo,

17:32.040 --> 17:34.399
useful but
in a limited way.

17:34.514 --> 17:35.812
He's not part
of everything,

17:36.475 --> 17:38.187
and he won't be
coming with us.

17:38.648 --> 17:40.138
He's got that girl
in a cage.

17:40.262 --> 17:42.287
The girl is
very important.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.859
Her name is Dana.
She's our leverage.

17:45.955 --> 17:48.826
She's gonna ensure that we all
make it home safe tonight.

17:50.462 --> 17:51.940
You know
the people there?

17:52.064 --> 17:53.274
A few.

17:53.813 --> 17:56.722
Some of my buddies
that I signed up with,

17:56.829 --> 17:58.313
friends
of Roderick's.

17:58.612 --> 18:00.453
What-- what about
your friends--

18:01.723 --> 18:04.241
Paul and Jacob?

18:04.471 --> 18:05.973
What happened
to them?

18:12.290 --> 18:13.904
I'm sorry.

18:14.897 --> 18:16.756
I didn't mean
to, uh...

18:21.932 --> 18:23.575
We do what
we have to do.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.519
Run it again.

18:39.855 --> 18:41.021
What's up?

18:41.143 --> 18:42.379
Going through the stuff
we confiscated

18:42.498 --> 18:43.643
from Charlie's warehouse.

18:43.739 --> 18:44.810
I found a bunch
of surveillance footage

18:44.910 --> 18:45.752
all spliced together,

18:45.866 --> 18:47.332
and one was marked
"detention center."

18:47.440 --> 18:48.313
Wait. It's from here?

18:48.427 --> 18:49.470
Mm-hmm.

18:50.447 --> 18:51.449
Well, that's
the prison's exit.

18:51.550 --> 18:53.719
Why would Charlie have
video of that?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.335
Do you have access to the
surveillance footage

18:57.435 --> 18:59.936
of Joe Carroll's transfer
vehicle just as he left?

19:00.017 --> 19:01.002
Uh, yes. I think I do.

19:01.105 --> 19:01.814
Pull it up,
the same point,

19:01.916 --> 19:03.554
exiting
the sally port.

19:07.112 --> 19:08.767
Look there.
Look at that.

19:08.883 --> 19:11.516
Run that back.
Enhance that.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.029
There.
That's an edit.

19:19.771 --> 19:21.909
The warden hijacked the
surveillance footage.

19:22.009 --> 19:23.077
Ryan, the warden
just left the building,

19:23.570 --> 19:25.164
said he was taking
the rest of the day off.

19:25.292 --> 19:26.736
Get Parker
on the phone now.

19:36.079 --> 19:37.063
Agent Parker.

19:37.172 --> 19:39.042
Joe's not in
the transport vehicle.

19:39.151 --> 19:40.106
What are you
talking about?

19:40.218 --> 19:42.069
Stop the transfer,
check the truck.

19:42.177 --> 19:43.183
He's not in there.

19:43.313 --> 19:44.494
That's impossible.

19:44.615 --> 19:46.494
The warden and his men
have been compromised.

19:46.755 --> 19:47.747
Do it!

19:48.943 --> 19:50.697
You need to stop, check
on the prisoner.

19:50.797 --> 19:51.760
What? Why?

19:51.893 --> 19:53.412
Stop now.

20:09.970 --> 20:11.201
Open up.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.540
What's going on?

20:16.646 --> 20:17.739
Need you to open
the vehicle.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.771
I'm not really authorized
to do that, ma'am.

20:19.869 --> 20:21.095
I'm authorizing you.

20:21.233 --> 20:22.762
That's not how it works.

20:24.186 --> 20:25.677
It's not a request.

20:38.419 --> 20:39.989
What the hell
is your problem?

20:42.238 --> 20:43.432
What did you do?

20:44.124 --> 20:45.847
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:52.579 --> 20:53.747
Open the trunk.

20:56.665 --> 20:58.050
You're gonna get
my daughter killed.

20:58.165 --> 20:59.718
Open the trunk.

21:29.898 --> 21:31.227
Where is he?

21:31.463 --> 21:32.757
Where the hell
is he?

21:57.148 --> 21:58.515
Yuhh.

21:59.091 --> 22:00.398
Thank you, Olivia.

22:07.745 --> 22:09.124
She's my daughter.

22:09.568 --> 22:10.807
They're gonna kill her.

22:10.947 --> 22:12.148
They won't.

22:12.306 --> 22:14.609
They need her alive to
guarantee Joe's safety,

22:14.722 --> 22:16.616
so just tell us
what you did,

22:16.759 --> 22:20.384
and we can save your
daughter and stop Joe.

22:28.496 --> 22:31.063
His lawyer Olivia Warren.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.891
They told me to
hand Joe off to her.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.267
Cuff him.

22:46.279 --> 22:48.882
We need a current location for
Olivia Warren, Joe Carroll's lawyer.

22:48.981 --> 22:50.254
Tell Mitchell to ping
Warren's cell phone.

22:50.349 --> 22:51.557
If it's on, that's
our best chance.

22:51.666 --> 22:53.735
Tell boy wonder thanks for the
help, but I'm already on it.

22:53.835 --> 22:54.635
She says she's
already--

22:54.727 --> 22:56.132
Yeah, no.
I heard that.

22:56.807 --> 22:59.770
Found it.
She's in Richmond, driving,

22:59.877 --> 23:02.688
headed southeast on 12th
Street toward Cary Ave.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.294
- Great.
- I'll call for backup.

23:04.411 --> 23:04.961
Southeast--

23:05.081 --> 23:06.569
Yeah. I heard
that, too.

23:14.238 --> 23:16.425
You seem a bit
nervous, Olivia.

23:17.610 --> 23:21.708
That's because I'm presently
committing at least 7 felonies.

23:22.724 --> 23:23.928
How much further?

23:24.052 --> 23:26.651
Oh. Just a few
more minutes.

23:37.017 --> 23:38.330
Hey.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.353
You're not supposed
to be out here.

23:42.893 --> 23:45.137
Denise thinks I'm
reading my book.

23:45.422 --> 23:46.677
Hmm.

23:47.433 --> 23:50.239
She said you were going
to take me to see my mom.

23:50.353 --> 23:52.047
Doesn't sound like
you believe her.

23:54.098 --> 23:55.673
She's telling you
the truth.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.483
I was just
with your mom, you know?

23:57.593 --> 23:58.677
You were?

23:58.788 --> 24:00.537
Yup. She wouldn't stop
talking about you.

24:00.652 --> 24:02.895
I was supposed to bring her
here so you could see her.

24:03.070 --> 24:04.772
What happened?

24:06.173 --> 24:07.509
I screwed up,

24:08.567 --> 24:12.513
and, uh, let the bad
guys get in the way.

24:14.405 --> 24:16.024
She okay?

24:16.396 --> 24:18.906
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:19.321 --> 24:20.620
She's fine.

24:21.467 --> 24:22.996
It's just...

24:23.880 --> 24:25.576
It's gonna take
a little bit longer

24:25.684 --> 24:28.454
before you can
see her, okay?

24:28.576 --> 24:30.250
I'm sorry about that.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.850
Okay?

24:33.327 --> 24:35.464
Will you tell me
the truth?

24:35.821 --> 24:37.789
What's really
going on?

24:40.157 --> 24:41.815
What do you
want to know?

24:42.339 --> 24:45.392
That girl,
will she be okay?

24:48.699 --> 24:50.034
Would it make you
feel better

24:50.166 --> 24:52.344
if I promise you
she'll be okay?

24:53.619 --> 24:55.819
Yeah? Okay.

24:56.568 --> 24:59.778
I give you my word,
all right?

25:07.351 --> 25:08.880
Is this where
you need to be?

25:09.218 --> 25:10.450
Yes.

25:10.878 --> 25:12.564
I don't think
anyone followed us.

25:12.756 --> 25:15.927
I admire your
positive attitude, Olivia,

25:16.052 --> 25:18.643
but I don't share
your optimism.

25:19.091 --> 25:23.771
There's, uh, one more thing
I need you to do for me.

25:23.869 --> 25:25.234
What is it?

25:26.464 --> 25:28.164
Call Ryan Hardy.

25:28.321 --> 25:30.448
What? Why would I?

25:30.562 --> 25:31.998
Do it.

25:44.867 --> 25:46.162
FBI dispatch.

25:46.277 --> 25:47.607
Hello. This is
Olivia Warren.

25:47.717 --> 25:49.232
I need to speak
to Ryan Hardy.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.747
It's an emergency.

25:50.862 --> 25:52.173
I'll connect you now.

25:57.163 --> 25:58.482
Hello?

25:58.598 --> 25:59.429
Mr. Hardy?

25:59.548 --> 26:00.647
Olivia, where are you?

26:00.732 --> 26:02.037
Is-- is Joe Carroll
with you?

26:02.203 --> 26:05.219
Say these exact words
to him--

26:05.385 --> 26:08.262
Joe Carroll
is killing me,

26:08.361 --> 26:09.899
and it's because
of you, Ryan.

26:10.016 --> 26:10.841
What?!

26:10.949 --> 26:12.391
Tell him that I am
killing you

26:12.528 --> 26:13.774
and it's because of him.

26:13.880 --> 26:14.677
Don't do it, Joe.

26:14.816 --> 26:15.828
Wait, Olivia.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.388
Please. No!

26:17.501 --> 26:18.483
Put Joe on the phone
with me.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.000
Tell him, Olivia.

26:20.188 --> 26:22.102
Tell him it's
all his fault.

26:22.215 --> 26:24.037
- I won't!
- What's going on?

26:24.169 --> 26:25.270
Tell him he can
kill me.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.219
Aah! Aah!

26:27.725 --> 26:28.912
Olivia?

26:29.326 --> 26:30.376
Olivia?

26:32.953 --> 26:34.594
No, wait, wait.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.151
I'm gonna be there soon.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.578
He can kill me.

26:38.697 --> 26:39.980
Olivia?

26:41.099 --> 26:45.022
Olivia? Hello?
Hello?

26:45.759 --> 26:48.016
No. No, no!

26:49.559 --> 26:50.607
No!

26:52.238 --> 26:53.823
Hardy, hold on.

27:46.707 --> 27:47.964
FBI!

27:51.882 --> 27:53.022
Anybody see anything?

27:53.126 --> 27:55.501
Some guy got out of the
car and ran in there.

27:55.649 --> 27:56.992
All right. Call 911!

28:02.961 --> 28:04.190
You see him?

28:04.583 --> 28:05.685
Go that way.

28:24.392 --> 28:25.587
I'm David.

28:25.732 --> 28:27.047
It's a pleasure,
sir.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.893
Weston,
he's up there!

28:32.506 --> 28:33.881
Get out of the way!
Come on!

28:34.002 --> 28:35.036
FBI!

28:35.149 --> 28:37.416
Stay back! Stay back!

28:38.447 --> 28:40.620
This way, sir.
This way.

28:47.617 --> 28:49.188
- Take that side. Move.
- All right.

29:03.066 --> 29:04.009
What are--

29:04.116 --> 29:05.508
Excuse me.

29:26.330 --> 29:28.016
I'm Louise, sir.

29:31.419 --> 29:33.331
Nice to meet you,
Louise.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.957
Douglas,
are you in the basement? Over.

29:40.357 --> 29:42.053
Douglas, Douglas,
do you copy?

29:53.864 --> 29:56.826
Unh! Unh! Unh!

30:03.316 --> 30:04.502
Ugh!

30:09.848 --> 30:10.946
Oh.

30:31.209 --> 30:34.671
Oh, this is
most baffling.

30:34.782 --> 30:38.535
You, me, us here
in this moment?

30:39.926 --> 30:41.310
What do I do?

30:41.827 --> 30:42.962
I kill you?

30:43.074 --> 30:43.917
Huh?

30:44.042 --> 30:45.567
Now?

30:47.074 --> 30:48.282
Hmm?

30:49.188 --> 30:52.472
No. This is--
this is all wrong.

30:52.888 --> 30:55.040
I mean, you can't die
in a parking garage.

30:55.169 --> 30:56.142
That would be
most uneventful,

30:56.255 --> 30:57.775
hardly dramatic at all.

30:57.883 --> 30:59.312
Go ahead.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.940
Do it.

31:03.316 --> 31:06.761
Really, you must admit
it's a quandary, hmm?

31:06.875 --> 31:12.445
I so very much want you
to live and see

31:13.148 --> 31:15.249
all that's
about to happen.

31:16.425 --> 31:20.615
You see, as much as you've
encountered up until this moment,

31:20.915 --> 31:22.695
I don't quite know
how to tell you this,

31:22.814 --> 31:25.521
but we have only
just concluded

31:25.670 --> 31:28.672
the first part
of our novel.

31:28.789 --> 31:30.279
Yes, Ryan.

31:30.426 --> 31:32.673
For 9 long years,

31:33.023 --> 31:35.371
I have sat
in my prison cell

31:35.498 --> 31:40.800
outlining this entire story
in my mind.

31:41.151 --> 31:44.014
I've meticulously planned
all of it

31:44.295 --> 31:46.210
with a little help
from my friends.

31:47.851 --> 31:51.015
That's a Beatles reference,
by the way.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.739
But I must say

31:54.838 --> 31:58.585
very, very much going
according to plan.

32:02.075 --> 32:03.958
We should leave
now, sir.

32:05.706 --> 32:09.732
There is so much more
to come, Ryan.

32:12.850 --> 32:14.642
I'll be in touch.

32:16.377 --> 32:17.964
Call me
when you're gone,

32:18.469 --> 32:20.260
and then I'll
let him go.

32:25.677 --> 32:28.656
Don't even think
about it.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.348
You can't kill me.

32:34.474 --> 32:36.113
Didn't you hear
what Joe just said?

32:37.355 --> 32:39.026
He wants me alive.

32:39.931 --> 32:41.821
Then I'll shoot you
in the leg.

32:43.455 --> 32:45.764
- Don't miss.
- No!

32:46.678 --> 32:47.741
Aigh!

33:36.335 --> 33:37.635
Okay.

33:37.856 --> 33:39.538
Yeah. We'll be on the
road in a few minutes.

33:40.183 --> 33:41.373
Clear to go.

33:41.568 --> 33:43.293
It's gonna take us a few
hours to get there.

33:44.647 --> 33:45.925
What about him?

33:48.008 --> 33:49.404
And the girl?

33:51.783 --> 33:54.102
Give me a few minutes.
I'll be right back.

34:01.916 --> 34:03.150
You need
anything else?

34:03.693 --> 34:05.339
Need a word
in private.

34:06.035 --> 34:07.135
Anything wrong?

34:07.242 --> 34:10.632
No. Just some
unfinished business.

34:24.726 --> 34:26.614
The helicopter
they used wasn't registered.

34:26.726 --> 34:28.436
Local airport radar
had them for a short time,

34:28.556 --> 34:30.090
but they lost them.

34:30.981 --> 34:33.119
Warden Montero's
in federal custody.

34:33.228 --> 34:34.527
Anyone locate
his daughter?

34:34.786 --> 34:35.650
Not yet.

34:35.775 --> 34:37.150
How are we supposed
to find these people?

34:37.471 --> 34:39.531
They're nameless,
faceless.

34:39.637 --> 34:41.692
We'll find them
and break them.

34:45.074 --> 34:48.243
Let's start
with this guy, right now.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.279
I can't let you
hurt him, Ryan.

34:50.391 --> 34:52.422
If we're gonna end this,
if we're gonna find Joe,

34:52.538 --> 34:54.067
we're gonna find his son,
the rest of them,

34:54.166 --> 34:56.726
we got to start doing
things a different way.

35:07.846 --> 35:09.570
I'll give you 5 minutes.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.014
Guys, listen up.

35:22.942 --> 35:24.188
Fellas...

35:25.500 --> 35:27.212
I need to speak
with him.

35:37.070 --> 35:38.610
So...

35:39.103 --> 35:40.688
the boy...

35:40.886 --> 35:42.621
Joey Matthews...

35:44.525 --> 35:45.876
where is he?

35:50.363 --> 35:53.038
I'm not gonna
tell you anything.

35:56.443 --> 35:58.089
You look like
you're in pain.

35:58.203 --> 35:59.660
I can handle it.

36:03.741 --> 36:05.827
That's good to know.

36:06.678 --> 36:08.222
Unh!

36:11.086 --> 36:12.619
Aigh!

36:13.920 --> 36:15.216
Aah!

36:15.602 --> 36:17.417
Aah!

36:36.979 --> 36:38.198
Need some bolt cutters!

36:38.307 --> 36:39.654
We found
the warden's daughter!

36:39.771 --> 36:40.985
We're gonna get
you out of there.

36:41.097 --> 36:43.058
She's a live.
Bring in the paramedics.

36:45.318 --> 36:47.416
Okay. Okay.
I got you now.

36:47.549 --> 36:49.005
You're okay now.
You're okay.

36:49.105 --> 36:50.547
We got you,
we got you.

36:51.505 --> 36:53.441
Hey, hey.
Look at me.

36:54.201 --> 36:55.564
There was
a little boy.

36:56.027 --> 36:57.151
Joey?

36:57.431 --> 36:58.594
They-- they took him.

36:58.732 --> 37:01.546
He-- he-- he was-- he
was trying to help me.

37:03.921 --> 37:06.042
Place is clear.
She's the only one.

37:07.624 --> 37:09.186
It's okay now.

37:09.458 --> 37:10.947
Come on. We're gonna
get you out of here.

37:26.861 --> 37:28.082
Did they tell you
where I'm going?

37:28.211 --> 37:29.531
Because they
won't tell me.

37:29.638 --> 37:30.936
Protective custody.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.322
Better if
I don't know.

37:36.873 --> 37:38.594
- So Joe's free...
- Claire.

37:38.728 --> 37:40.444
And now I get
locked up.

37:43.596 --> 37:45.061
It's for your
own safety.

37:46.935 --> 37:48.021
And my son?

37:48.149 --> 37:49.557
I'm not giving up,
Claire.

37:50.325 --> 37:51.944
That's what he wants,

37:52.570 --> 37:54.249
but he's not
gonna win.

37:55.968 --> 37:58.229
This isn't
a game, Ryan.

37:58.335 --> 37:59.618
This is my life,

37:59.718 --> 38:01.642
this is
my son's life!
