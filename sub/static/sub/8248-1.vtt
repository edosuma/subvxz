00:36.240 --> 00:39.400
I want to tell you about the time
I almost died.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.000
I never thought it would happen to me.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.520
Not at this age.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.080
Beaten...

01:02.080 --> 01:03.720
...outsmarted.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.280
How did I get into this fix?
How did it all begin?

01:07.760 --> 01:10.400
If I go back to the beginning
that'll take forever.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.000
So, let's start more recently.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.040
Somewhere.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.640
Anywhere.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.240
Reese.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.640
I thought the governor
didn't approve of this.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.000
The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.240
So what is this, six notches on your belt?

02:00.480 --> 02:01.520
Eight.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.080
Congratulations.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.280
Fuck you.

02:05.280 --> 02:07.200
Ask me more nicely, huh?

02:07.200 --> 02:08.560
John Hobbes.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.840
You're wanted in the dance hall.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.240
Edgar Reese.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.400
Well, well, well.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.000
Look who's here.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.560
It's the brilliant detective
who sealed my brutish fate.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.840
That's right.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
So, what's this?
They're making you famous now?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.760
Big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.200
All courtesy of the ACLU.
They'll shoot me getting smoked.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.880
Who knows?
Maybe it'll be a big video rental.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.560
All these society ladies showing it
to their dinner guests:

02:54.560 --> 02:57.520
"You see that there?
That's a urine stain, ladies."

02:58.000 --> 02:59.840
"Oh, my, it's not urine."

03:00.880 --> 03:02.400
It's good to see you, Hobbes.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.560
It's good to be seen by you, Reese.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.560
You're...

03:09.560 --> 03:11.040
...my best pal.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.760
You're still a good fella.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.360
Open the gate.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.640
You remind me of somebody, Hobbes.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.760
Indeed you do.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.360
Indeed you do.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.760
Do you like riddles?

04:00.760 --> 04:02.040
No, I don't.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.040
Here's a beaut.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.280
Why is there...

04:07.800 --> 04:10.520
...a space between Lyons and Spakowsky?

04:11.360 --> 04:12.160
What?

04:12.160 --> 04:15.840
Come on. You should know this one, pal.
You should know this one.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.360
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.600
Open the gate.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.520
Remember this, Hobbes.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.520
A day...

04:31.160 --> 04:33.360
...a week, a month.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.640
What are you, a Nazi now?

04:39.760 --> 04:40.880
It's Dutch.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.840
What goes around...

04:43.800 --> 04:45.360
...really goes around.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.440
You have a safe trip.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.520
I'll be looking for you.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.200
What goes around really goes around.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.680
Howdy, folks.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.440
Ladies, gents...

05:08.440 --> 05:10.480
...cocksuckers, pederasts...

05:10.840 --> 05:13.600
...l hope you all enjoy the show. Yes, I do.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.560
I'll give you a blowjob
if you get me out of this baby.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.600
"Time

06:40.960 --> 06:43.080
"ls on my side

06:43.320 --> 06:44.600
"Yes, it is

06:45.200 --> 06:47.280
"Time

06:47.680 --> 06:49.520
"ls on my side

06:50.080 --> 06:51.640
"Yes, it is

06:52.120 --> 06:54.000
"Now, you always say

06:54.360 --> 06:56.440
"That you want to be free

06:56.800 --> 06:59.520
"But I'll come running back

06:59.960 --> 07:02.960
"l'll come running back to you"

07:04.960 --> 07:07.640
Baby, come on, go ahead...

07:07.640 --> 07:09.560
...light up my life!

07:38.120 --> 07:40.520
Something is always happening.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.960
But when it happens,
people don't always see it...

07:46.440 --> 07:47.960
...or understand it...

07:49.480 --> 07:51.000
...or accept it.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.520
The criminals don't accept consequences.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.080
They kill. It's not their fault.
This is the consequence of what I do.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.480
-Look who made it. How'd it go?
-Mr. Consequence.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.480
-He died.
-I told you.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.880
Get one more.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.480
Nice to see you.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.120
How you doing, Gracie?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.160
-Don't tempt me with that.
-Sorry.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.320
What's your poison? We got some Becks.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.800
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.920
-Budweiser's good for me.
-Budweiser?

09:24.920 --> 09:25.960
-Yeah.
-Good.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.920
No, we're going imported here.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.480
-If you can't afford it, I'll buy.
-I can afford it. Budweiser.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.720
At least have a Bud lce
or a Bud Dry or something.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.080
It is just a Bud, okay?

09:38.120 --> 09:39.800
-You guys want anything?
-No.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.000
Here's your Bud.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.520
He was one of the most notorious inmates.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.760
Here you go.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.400
Thank you, sweetheart.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.400
You're an unusual cop, Hobbes.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.440
Really?

09:50.960 --> 09:54.760
I've been in this precinct about what,
five, six months?

09:54.760 --> 09:57.240
Everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

09:57.240 --> 09:59.160
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

09:59.160 --> 10:01.040
Now is that true, or what?

10:01.880 --> 10:03.240
No, I don't like cream.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.600
That means "no"?

10:04.600 --> 10:05.880
Yeah, it means "no."

10:05.880 --> 10:09.480
Now, is that "no" as in "never,"
"no" as in "sometimes"...

10:09.480 --> 10:12.400
...or "no" as in "l do,
but I don't like to talk about it"?

10:12.400 --> 10:13.960
"No" as in "never."

10:17.080 --> 10:19.000
This is a big city, Hobbesy.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.640
We got a tradition to uphold.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.960
Got something wrong with your ears?
When the man says something, he says it.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.080
This is hypothetical:

10:25.080 --> 10:29.400
A cop who's trying to make ends meet
wants a little something on the side....

10:29.400 --> 10:30.920
I don't like cream...

10:30.920 --> 10:32.520
...and I don't judge.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.960
You don't judge?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.800
He's a fucking saint, huh?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.440
So you're telling me
that under no circumstances...

10:38.440 --> 10:41.080
...would a holy man like you ever,
you know...

10:41.080 --> 10:43.400
...break the law or do something....

10:44.600 --> 10:45.720
Look, Lou...

10:47.400 --> 10:51.240
...l could jump across the table,
snatch your heart out of your chest...

10:51.240 --> 10:54.040
...squeeze the blood out,
and stick it in your front pocket.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.120
Oh, yeah?

10:55.400 --> 10:57.800
If I lost control. But if I did...

10:58.280 --> 11:00.920
...l'd be no different
than the people we bust.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.840
Now, as to your general question....

11:04.240 --> 11:06.880
You take any cop on the force,
cream or no...

11:06.880 --> 11:10.920
...ninety-nine percent of the time
they're doing their job, aren't they?

11:10.920 --> 11:11.960
Ninety-nine five.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.320
Point five.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.760
So he or she, cream or no...

11:16.200 --> 11:19.240
...is doing more good out there every day...

11:19.240 --> 11:22.560
...than any lawyer or a stockbroker or...

11:23.000 --> 11:26.480
...President of the United States
can ever do in their lifetime.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.920
Cops are the "chosen people."

11:29.920 --> 11:31.080
Amen.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.320
Guess I'm switching to Bud.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.200
Gracie, come here and get this foreign shit
off my table...

11:45.200 --> 11:47.000
...and bring me three Buds.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.760
Damn it, what took you so long?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.360
You know what you'd look like
with this sandwich up your ass?

13:13.040 --> 13:14.200
Pardon me?

13:14.200 --> 13:17.600
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.720
Charles, I hate to do this, but....

13:20.720 --> 13:22.960
Put the job where the sandwich goes.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.840
Hello?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.600
Hello?

13:49.960 --> 13:51.080
Hello?

14:00.720 --> 14:03.800
Here we go. Juice, pretzels...

14:04.360 --> 14:05.440
...apple....

14:05.440 --> 14:07.920
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.520
Uncle John, will you please
make my lunch tomorrow?

14:10.520 --> 14:11.720
Here's Toby.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.640
I can't be having the same thing every day.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.600
What do you want,
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

14:20.240 --> 14:21.840
Jelly and peanut butter?

14:24.400 --> 14:25.720
I love you, Dad.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.040
Don't forget your Uncle Johnny.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.520
I can feel the love in this room, man.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.840
-Bye.
-Be good.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.280
-Have a good day at school.
-Okay. Bye.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.480
You're doing a good job, Art.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.720
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.640
Why don't you sit down with me?
Let's talk a bit.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.920
You're not in a hurry?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.720
No, no....

14:47.960 --> 14:49.520
I can relax today.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.160
Besides, what are they going to do?
Fire me?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.200
-How're you doing?
-Okay.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.040
-You're all right?
-Yeah.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.320
I love you, Johnny.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.600
You ever think it would be easier,
your life would be easier...

15:09.600 --> 15:12.520
...if maybe me and Sam
were not living with--

15:12.960 --> 15:14.000
No, no.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.880
-Maybe Marcy wouldn't have left.
-Later for Marcy.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.680
If she loved me, she would've never left.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.560
Besides, family's always first.
You're my brother.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.840
I love you, too.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.840
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.240
-No more peanut butter and jelly.
-Okay.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.320
A cop knows.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.080
A cop sees.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.200
Even the most casual thing, it registers.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.920
Often you don't remember till later on.
But then...

16:29.920 --> 16:32.360
...you look back and you realize...

16:33.960 --> 16:35.280
...you knew.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.520
Good morning, Detective.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.800
How're you doing, Lieutenant?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.560
Look who's feeling good today.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.520
Hey, what can I say?
You're looking better than me.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.520
Got a call on four, Hobbes.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.360
Thank you, Denise. Jonesy?

16:53.960 --> 16:55.880
How's everything today? Good?

16:57.160 --> 16:58.400
Detective Hobbes.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.040
Pal, you got a pen?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.080
4541...

17:02.080 --> 17:04.319
...South Stender, Apartment 2.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.040
Who's there?

17:06.040 --> 17:07.880
A clue, Magoo.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.800
Couldn't sleep last night.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.000
Who can?

17:15.319 --> 17:18.880
Remember I used to get calls at two or
three o'clock in the morning from Reese?

17:18.880 --> 17:20.720
He loved you. He truly did.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.880
Somebody called me last night.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.440
Imagine that.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.800
-Denise?
-Yeah?

17:25.800 --> 17:29.400
Send a car to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.000
Make sure we gain entry.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.080
Got a body?

17:32.080 --> 17:36.320
No, it's probably just some knucklehead,
saw me on TV, trying to impress his girl.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.320
-How'd I look last night?
-Fabulous.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.160
You saw that? Four different channels.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.080
You're a god. You're a god.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.880
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.640
Super says no family,
no friends, no nothing.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.600
Why is he dead, then?

17:57.360 --> 17:58.640
What've you got?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.200
I've got puncture wounds.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.200
Look for a syringe, or something.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.760
Eighteen.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.800
-What's that, his eighteenth victim?
-Could be.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.880
Could be.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.080
Very tidy.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.160
The DOA's been dead awhile,
so what the hell is this?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.600
Killer slept over and then...

18:29.600 --> 18:31.680
...had a nice, neat breakfast.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.040
Looks like it.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.160
Check this out.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.280
Shit.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.720
What?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.160
It's a riddle.

18:53.120 --> 18:56.960
Reese, in his cell before he died,
he asked me, "Why is there a space...

18:56.960 --> 18:59.120
"...between Lyons and Spakowsky?"

19:00.000 --> 19:00.960
Yeah?

19:05.760 --> 19:07.120
Accomplice?

19:07.520 --> 19:09.520
Reese had an accomplice?

19:09.920 --> 19:12.360
Unless it's a copycat. Maybe the...

19:12.720 --> 19:15.880
...prison guards or the people
that made that documentary.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.080
-You got a minute?
-I'll be there in a second.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.920
Fifty people must have seen
that documentary by now.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.080
Me and Jonesy will run them down.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.280
Yeah, good.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.520
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gloves.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.160
Left prints on the spoon and cereal bowl
like he was advertising.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.360
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.480
I hate to be stupid...

19:36.480 --> 19:37.840
Enjoy it, Lou.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.320
...but is motive still something
we think about...

19:40.320 --> 19:43.640
...or is it that all these crimes
are done out of sickness?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.040
Number 2.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.640
Everything is motive.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.520
Sickness is motive.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.800
Sharp.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.600
The coroner's prelim on the Ruski.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.080
Isn't that the wacko poison
that Reese used on them Arab kids?

19:59.360 --> 20:00.800
-Tiff?
-Yeah?

20:00.800 --> 20:04.560
You like riddles? You know,
puzzles and shit? Brainteasers?

20:04.560 --> 20:06.640
Sure, as long as I'm doing the teasing.

20:06.640 --> 20:10.720
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?

20:11.320 --> 20:13.480
What does that even mean? Come on!

20:13.480 --> 20:15.280
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.640
South Precinct.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.080
Come again?

20:19.080 --> 20:21.400
Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.840
Keep talking.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.880
The guy's a fucking asshole.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.000
He's the King Kong of assholes.
He's a fucking legend.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.360
His name's up on the wall.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.200
What?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.040
Some chief in the '30s
thought it would boost morale.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.480
They kept it up until '81 or '82,
and it got to be like a booby prize.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.480
It was downtown in the lobby...
till they remodeled.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.640
Must've passed it by 1,000 times.

20:50.640 --> 20:54.240
I guess I need to open my eyes
and look around sometime.

20:54.480 --> 20:57.680
Lyons, I don't remember him,
but Spakowsky, he was around.

20:57.680 --> 21:01.360
This guy was so fucking mean
that his wife shot him in the foot.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.800
Who was '65?

21:02.800 --> 21:04.320
Who was in that space?

21:04.320 --> 21:06.360
You got me, bud. I don't know.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.720
You're saying they took a name off?
Why would they do that?

21:10.720 --> 21:14.720
I don't know. I called Records.
They say they don't know who it was...

21:14.720 --> 21:17.360
...and they don't know why it's not there.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.120
We'd better find out.

22:12.640 --> 22:15.120
Lieutenant, just the man I wanted to see.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.000
"Robert Milano."

22:20.000 --> 22:21.280
That's right.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.920
Cop of the Year, 1965.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.920
Eight months later, goes up to a cabin,
middle of nowhere, dies cleaning his gun.

22:27.920 --> 22:32.080
So it's either two things:
He was dirty or it was a woman.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.440
What?

22:35.680 --> 22:38.000
I met him once...Milano.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.480
He had a poker up his ass,
but otherwise he was a good cop.

22:41.480 --> 22:44.280
-What I want to know is--
-I know what you want.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.320
I can't help you.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.160
Can't help me?

22:48.560 --> 22:49.600
Look...

22:50.640 --> 22:52.640
...do all of us a favor, okay?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.840
Whatever you find out...

22:54.840 --> 22:56.680
...keep it to yourself.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.760
I got something for you.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.840
Documentary on Reese.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.560
Thank you. You're a real white man.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.120
Jonesy.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.360
-Tape on Reese. You want to view it?
-Give me a sec.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.360
What do you got on Muskavich?

23:14.360 --> 23:15.800
Fingerprints were bust.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.520
The crime scene says
the killer probably had dark hair.

23:18.520 --> 23:19.960
He probably was left-handed.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.600
Yeah, like Reese.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.560
He had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn flakes.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.960
Directory Assistance.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.760
Can you give me a number on a Milano...

23:28.760 --> 23:30.440
...Sylvia M-l-L-A-N-O.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.760
Hold, please.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.360
Hey, Lieutenant.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.920
Excuse me, Boss.

23:37.920 --> 23:42.400
If somebody dies because you kept
your mouth shut, you're holding the bag.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.120
When it's a perfect world, let me know.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.800
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.160
-Is that clear enough for you?
-Yeah.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.040
I'm sorry. There's no listing.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.360
Okay, thanks. No, listen, listen.
You still there? Hello?

23:56.360 --> 24:00.760
Check and see if there's a G. Milano,
a Gretta Milano. Can you do that for me?

24:00.760 --> 24:01.880
-Hold, please.
-Thanks.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.800
Syringe had the same prints.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.600
-So now what? Video time?
-Yeah.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.320
You know, I was thinking....

24:11.320 --> 24:12.720
Don't hurt yourself.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.760
Eat me.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.360
Hold for the number.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.640
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.640
He quotes Reese. He could be a cop.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.360
He could be, huh?

24:23.360 --> 24:25.360
Lou, could be a cop, huh?

24:25.640 --> 24:27.760
Please leave a message. Thank you.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.200
Make sure Hobbes gets a copy of this.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.960
Are you watching, Johnny-boy?
I hope you're paying close attention.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.480
Every gesture!

24:36.480 --> 24:37.760
Every word!

24:46.240 --> 24:47.400
Wait a second.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.520
What?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.120
Check something out.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.280
That...

24:57.600 --> 24:59.520
...language he was speaking...

24:59.520 --> 25:00.800
...later.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.280
That's Dutch?

25:03.200 --> 25:04.640
That's what he said.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.560
What's he speaking now? ls that Dutch?

25:08.640 --> 25:09.640
This now?

25:11.520 --> 25:13.680
This is mumbo-jumbo, gibberish.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.960
You sure on that?

25:36.040 --> 25:37.280
Who is it?

25:37.280 --> 25:40.840
It's Detective John Hobbes.
I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.480
-Oh, yes. You left a message.
-Yes.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.760
I wanted to talk to you about your father.

25:53.640 --> 25:54.960
How're you doing?

25:55.840 --> 25:57.000
May I come in?

25:59.200 --> 26:00.480
Sure.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.560
You're surrounded by angels.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.680
I teach theology at the university.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.080
I see. Very beautiful.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.360
Thank you.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.600
Why do you want to know
about my father?

26:25.320 --> 26:29.120
It's 30 years later and the files are sealed...

26:30.720 --> 26:33.600
...and my boss was told to let it alone, so...

26:34.560 --> 26:35.760
...here I am.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.640
I can tell you what my mother told me
before she died.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.440
Why do you want to know?
Just curious, or...?

26:44.440 --> 26:45.520
No, ma'am.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.760
See, I'm the detective
who caught Edgar Reese.

26:48.760 --> 26:51.760
I'm not sure if you're familiar with him.
He was just executed.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.480
-Yeah, I read about him.
-Right.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.120
And this Reese fella, he...

26:57.200 --> 27:00.080
...in a roundabout way,
gave me your father's name.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.360
Did Reese like to sing?

27:06.840 --> 27:08.440
Yeah, he did, actually.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.600
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?

27:13.600 --> 27:16.040
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.080
Do you want some coffee?

27:19.080 --> 27:20.280
Sure.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.120
One condition:

27:24.680 --> 27:26.200
You and I never spoke.

27:26.680 --> 27:30.280
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the files.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.800
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Agreed?

27:33.800 --> 27:36.360
Will I get a cup of coffee if I say yes?

27:39.240 --> 27:42.320
Detective, my dad was a good cop.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.360
"Pride of the force" and all that.
And then he shot himself.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.720
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.

27:49.720 --> 27:53.000
He'd caught a killer,
but copycat crimes started.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.360
Evidence mounted up against him:
fingerprints, witnesses.

27:56.360 --> 28:00.520
The press never got real proof,
but my father's medal was rescinded.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.720
I see.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.840
So you're saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away?

28:07.320 --> 28:10.920
The mayor, the governor and
the chief of police, they all needed a hero.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.240
Some of these people are
still important today.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.800
-I see.
-No. Not yet, you don't.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.520
My father saw the evidence against him,
told my mother he couldn't beat it.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.240
So, he went to this cabin in the mountains.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.760
It's a place that's been
in my mother's family for generations.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.520
He went there and....

28:32.520 --> 28:33.720
The thing is...

28:33.720 --> 28:36.680
...l know my father was innocent
of those murders.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.560
How do you know?

28:40.560 --> 28:42.560
How do you know he was innocent?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.520
It was 30 years ago.
It's not important anymore.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.640
It's important to me, Miss Milano.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.040
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the killer to be punished?

28:52.040 --> 28:54.320
-Of course, I do.
-But?

28:57.960 --> 29:01.640
Are you afraid that if you tell me
your life may be in danger?

29:02.840 --> 29:03.880
Yeah.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.200
That's it?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.040
Yes.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.800
Okay.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.680
Okay.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.360
Thank you very much.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.560
-For the coffee as well.
-Okay.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.880
Oh, listen....

29:21.880 --> 29:24.520
If I have any more questions,
can I call you?

29:24.920 --> 29:26.480
I'd rather you didn't.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.960
Detective....

29:35.480 --> 29:37.040
Do you believe in God?

29:38.040 --> 29:40.480
Yeah. I go to church every now and then.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.040
What I see in my line of work...

29:43.280 --> 29:45.440
...faith's a little hard to sustain.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.520
Good luck.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.920
Sometimes I think the basicjob
that human beings have...

30:00.920 --> 30:03.960
...isjust to figure out
what the hell is going on.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.360
Example: Gretta Milano.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.880
What was she hiding?
What was she so scared of?.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.800
And then her question about God.
What the hell is that all about?

30:21.360 --> 30:24.400
You never know.
Down to the smallest thing.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.720
The man who passes you
and catches your eye. Does he know you?

30:28.720 --> 30:33.200
Did you go to school together? ls he a
homicidal maniac who hates you on sight?

30:37.800 --> 30:39.160
Or is it nothing?

30:40.440 --> 30:41.640
Nothing at all.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.240
Wake up.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.960
Go to bed.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.560
I know. I know.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.560
Here we go. Up. Up.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.040
I'm going, Uncle John.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.640
Hello?

31:50.920 --> 31:52.000
Hello?

31:57.080 --> 31:58.280
Let's go, Sam.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.080
Good night.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.560
Good night, son.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.720
-Johnny?
-Yeah?

32:17.320 --> 32:18.960
Do you ever get scared?

32:21.080 --> 32:22.360
Yeah, sometimes.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.000
Me, too.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.680
Good night, Art.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.520
-Hello?
-Mrs. Moohr? This is Charles.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.640
Apparently, I must have gotten drunk
or something...

33:06.640 --> 33:08.800
...because the last few days....

33:09.840 --> 33:11.080
Am I working tonight?

33:11.080 --> 33:12.360
You quit.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.160
I quit?

33:14.160 --> 33:17.400
Yes. You insulted Harry
and he hired someone else.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.480
But.... I mean.... How...?

33:22.920 --> 33:24.800
Look, I'm really sorry....

33:25.120 --> 33:28.240
Could you apologize, please,
to your husband for whatever--

33:28.240 --> 33:30.880
We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.320
Hello?

33:56.440 --> 33:59.160
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

34:37.719 --> 34:40.840
I played Reese's tape on the phone
to a linguist. He's coming down.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.080
Yeah? Prelim?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.960
Said it sounded Mideastern.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.199
-Anything on Muskavich?
-Only the pizza.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.560
Now, we're hitting
your area of expertise, huh?

34:48.560 --> 34:50.560
Pizza is a staff of life.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.760
Without pizza and other fine ltalian foods,
there would be no happiness.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.440
There was one slice left:

34:56.440 --> 34:59.000
Garlic, linguica and pineapple.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.040
Plus, there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.400
So it was the killer's eats.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.280
Hell of a clue. You better write
that one up for the journal.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.280
I will, Lou. And I will laud you copiously.

35:09.720 --> 35:10.680
Thank you.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.840
Detectives? Your guy's in Video.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.720
The linguist guy's here.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.760
I'll be right there.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.200
Any luck?

35:22.200 --> 35:24.640
John Hobbes, Professor Richard Louders.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.360
-How do you do?
-Pleasure.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.360
This is completely exhilarating.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.880
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?

35:30.880 --> 35:33.000
Not now. Have a seat.

35:33.320 --> 35:36.840
Professor says it's a language.
He's just never heard it spoken aloud.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.840
-Meaning?
-Some kind of antique.

35:38.840 --> 35:43.160
I believe this is a Biblical tongue:
Syrian Aramaic.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.800
Only a few nomadic tribes still use it.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.440
So you don't know what he's saying?

35:47.440 --> 35:49.160
I haven't the faintest.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.120
He's not too pleasant, is he?

35:52.440 --> 35:55.720
But if you'd spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.480
I'd appreciate it. If you could wait out front
for 15 minutes...

35:59.800 --> 36:01.320
...we'll dupe one off for you.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.680
I'll be waiting.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.320
-See you in a minute.
-'Bye, Detective.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.240
-Syrian Aramaic.
-Imagine that.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.520
I got something else, too.
I'm looking up this clipping...

36:17.520 --> 36:19.960
...of Reese, high-school baseball team.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.080
He bats right.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.320
He throws right.

36:26.160 --> 36:27.720
What are you saying, Hobbes?

36:27.720 --> 36:30.080
Reese pulled off some of the sickest shit
on record.

36:30.080 --> 36:34.400
He speaks a language 2,000 years old and
you're worried 'cause he's ambidextrous?

36:34.400 --> 36:36.040
I'm worried about everything.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.640
-Hobbes, call on Line 1 .
-Thank you, Bill.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.400
Detective Hobbes.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.720
Hey, pal, need another clue?

36:45.360 --> 36:47.360
1339 South Grove...

36:47.760 --> 36:49.000
...Apartment 9.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.680
Jonesy, that pizza place
with the number 17?

36:56.320 --> 36:57.960
Is that close to Grove?

36:57.960 --> 36:59.360
I think so.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.720
They're in the same place...

37:16.720 --> 37:17.920
...exactly.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.000
-It's like he's laughing at us.
-He is.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.880
Cash, not a check?

37:33.120 --> 37:34.320
That's right.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.600
Take a look at this.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.200
What the hell is this?

37:57.360 --> 37:58.880
You know what's scary?

38:00.880 --> 38:05.200
I'm going home last night, this guy's
walking past me, he's going the other way.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.760
He looks me right in the eye.

38:07.760 --> 38:11.000
The kind of look like he knows you.
You know what I mean?

38:15.440 --> 38:17.680
It's the same guy that's in the bathtub.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.400
-The stiff.
-You're shitting me.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.200
I shit you not. Same guy.

38:22.840 --> 38:24.280
Oh, man.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.440
I ain't smart enough to figure this out.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.640
Me, neither.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.240
Found under the sink.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.360
Same poison?

38:35.360 --> 38:38.000
Same poison.
Better get that down to the lab.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.120
-What else have you got?
-The number on his chest.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.680
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?

38:43.680 --> 38:47.720
Everything's under a Charles Olom,
but it looks like that's an alias.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.920
So, we're running his prints.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.520
To quote Yogi Berra ,
"lt's like deja vu all over again."

39:01.520 --> 39:03.240
-You mean Reese?
-Yeah.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.520
Whoever is doing it...

39:08.160 --> 39:09.920
...has a thing for Hobbes.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.280
Seems like.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.120
How is he?

39:14.120 --> 39:15.520
Who, Hobbes?

39:16.560 --> 39:18.960
How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.200
If it starts to work at him,
let me know, okay?

39:23.400 --> 39:26.200
And if it starts to work on me,
I'll let you know.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.160
I thought that was you.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.880
What are you doing, more...

39:50.880 --> 39:52.600
...historical research?

39:55.720 --> 39:57.960
Nice talking to you. See you Monday.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.640
All right, Lou.

40:01.320 --> 40:03.000
Come on, Jimmy.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.440
Over here, shoot it!

40:04.440 --> 40:06.120
Shoot it, shoot it!

40:06.120 --> 40:08.320
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.640
That's okay, that's okay.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.160
Score is tied.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.080
No, 19 to 17.

40:14.720 --> 40:15.880
You can take him.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.640
Pass the ball. I'm open.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.320
Take the ball back.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.960
Johnny's going to make a point.
He's got the ball.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.000
-Hi, Art.
-How're you doing?

40:26.240 --> 40:28.480
Good one! Three, two, one!

40:30.360 --> 40:32.080
That's it for me. I've gotta go.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.320
No, I've gotta go. I have a long drive.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.640
Art, get in here.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.760
Uncle John, but he's a spaz.

40:38.240 --> 40:41.440
You don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?

40:41.440 --> 40:43.120
Cherish what you got.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.560
Get on in there.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.600
-Want to come with us?
-I didn't bring my shoes.

40:47.600 --> 40:48.640
Come on.

40:49.920 --> 40:50.880
What's up?

40:50.880 --> 40:53.280
-Tiffany didn't get you?
-No, what's up?

40:53.280 --> 40:55.400
You know how weird this case is?

40:56.680 --> 40:58.560
We got a positive l.D...

40:59.240 --> 41:00.640
...on Charles Olom.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.200
Real name's Mickey Noons.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.640
Born in Canada, illegal alien.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.200
Blah, blah, blah. Smalltime shithead.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.760
That ain't bad.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.120
That ain't it.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.040
Noons killed the Ruski. It's his prints
all over Muskavich's apartment.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.160
What?

41:17.760 --> 41:20.240
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...

41:20.480 --> 41:23.360
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn flakes.

41:24.040 --> 41:27.280
Three days later somebody does
the exact same thing to him.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.800
"Exact," because Noons and Muskavich
were killed by the same person.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.240
Some kind of ringmaster?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.600
I think so.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.600
Hey, Art. You and Sam don't forget lunch,
all right?

41:37.040 --> 41:39.960
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.640
I got a bad feeling about this.

41:42.640 --> 41:43.880
Me, too.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.520
Somebody's playing with my dick
and it ain't me.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.640
-Yeah. See you.
-'Bye.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.400
-Ten minutes, Art!
-Okay.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.920
There are moments which mark your life.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.360
Moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same.

43:38.640 --> 43:41.640
And time is divided into two parts:

43:42.680 --> 43:44.000
Before this...

43:44.560 --> 43:45.960
...and after this.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.920
Sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.880
That's the test...or so I tell myself.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.880
I tell myself that at times like that...

44:25.560 --> 44:29.000
...strong people keep moving forward,
anyway...

44:31.320 --> 44:33.720
...no matter what they're going to find.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.160
-Miss Milano.
-Oh, hello.

47:44.760 --> 47:47.400
I went to your family's place
in the mountains.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.800
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.520
Let me get that for you.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.440
Trees and the water....

47:53.440 --> 47:56.120
Absolutely beautiful.
What does "Azazel" mean?

47:58.040 --> 48:02.200
Your father wrote it in the basement
on the wall, then he painted over it.

48:02.840 --> 48:04.200
My dictionary...

48:04.440 --> 48:06.120
...says that it's "the...

48:06.120 --> 48:07.800
"...evil spirit of the wilderness."

48:07.800 --> 48:09.400
Whatever that means.

48:09.400 --> 48:12.240
One of the books your father had up there
talks about demons...

48:12.240 --> 48:14.240
...and how they move by touch.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.920
Walk away, Mr. Hobbes.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.280
-Say again?
-If you enjoy your life...

48:18.280 --> 48:22.240
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.200
It's out of my hands, Miss Milano.
I mean, it's my job.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.480
'Bye, Mr. Hobbes.

48:34.720 --> 48:35.720
That's it?

48:35.720 --> 48:37.240
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.080
-Fax.
-Thanks.

48:55.920 --> 48:59.640
Phone company sent MUDs and LUDs
for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.400
See those calls there?

49:01.400 --> 49:04.600
They were made right around
the time they were killed.

49:05.280 --> 49:07.720
You're saying the killer called me
from the crime scene?

49:07.720 --> 49:08.880
Sure looks like it.

49:08.880 --> 49:11.600
-Reese used to call me at night.
-Reese is dead.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.280
Whoever's doing this
is in league with Reese...

49:14.280 --> 49:17.920
...or was imitating Reese.
I know he's still calling my house.

49:18.440 --> 49:20.400
How many times have I got to change
my phone number?

49:20.400 --> 49:23.320
The more you change it, the more it looks
like someone on the inside.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.640
Like a cop?

49:25.320 --> 49:26.360
Yeah.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.640
It's nothing to me...

49:33.640 --> 49:35.840
...but the egos upstairs....

49:37.640 --> 49:39.240
-You hear me?
-Both ears.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.520
I'm going to lose my sense of humor.
What've you got?

49:47.760 --> 49:49.720
A translation from the Aramaic:

49:50.080 --> 49:51.960
"l can't enter you by touch.

49:51.960 --> 49:55.800
"But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.520
"l'll fuck you up and down, left and right."
That's in the Bible.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.680
"lf that doesn't work, I have other ways."

50:01.680 --> 50:04.200
We need a translation of the translation.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.240
Anything else?

50:15.960 --> 50:17.600
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.120
I like the night.

50:53.360 --> 50:54.560
The street.

50:54.560 --> 50:56.160
The smells.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.680
The sense of another world.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.800
Sometimes you come
face to face with yourself.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.080
Now...

53:04.080 --> 53:05.680
...put that card back in.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.480
-Anywhere.
-All right.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.360
-Tell me when to stop, okay?
-Okay.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.680
Can you pronounce it for me again?

53:15.920 --> 53:18.840
Okay, Professor, I think I got it.
All right...'bye.

53:41.480 --> 53:44.160
I can get inside you.
After I'm spirit, I won't.

53:44.640 --> 53:45.600
No.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.680
Better I get you for real.

53:49.200 --> 53:49.880
Fuck you...

53:49.880 --> 53:52.960
...up, down, left, right, coming, going....

53:53.680 --> 53:55.600
I'll get so close to you...

53:56.120 --> 53:58.000
...so close it breaks you.

53:59.600 --> 54:01.360
And if that doesn't work...

54:01.600 --> 54:03.360
...well, I have other ways.

54:04.080 --> 54:05.560
I have so many...

54:05.560 --> 54:06.960
...many ways.

54:24.840 --> 54:25.800
Right.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.360
Fifteen minutes.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.360
Hi. Can I help you?

54:34.400 --> 54:36.760
You're releasing a Richard Suckle?

54:37.640 --> 54:40.560
-He called a cab.
-I'll have him brought right down.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.440
-Looking good today.
-Thanks.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.040
Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.200
Thank you.

55:07.120 --> 55:08.760
Hobbesy, tell me something.

55:08.760 --> 55:09.760
Shoot.

55:09.760 --> 55:12.960
The other day you were
in the basement reading an old file.

55:12.960 --> 55:14.040
What about it?

55:14.040 --> 55:17.040
Looked like a map in there.
Are you going somewhere?

55:17.880 --> 55:18.920
I went up to the country.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.760
It's great to get out of town.

55:20.760 --> 55:22.720
Lovely. Fresh air, you know?

55:23.000 --> 55:27.200
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.

55:27.520 --> 55:28.880
It was beautiful.

55:30.520 --> 55:32.480
So I'm curious. Where'd you go?

55:34.080 --> 55:35.320
Why do you ask?

55:38.120 --> 55:39.160
Come here.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.040
Come here.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.040
Come on, come here.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.360
"Time

55:48.680 --> 55:50.400
"ls on my side

55:51.480 --> 55:52.600
"Yes, it is

55:53.040 --> 55:54.840
"Time

55:55.760 --> 55:57.480
"ls on my side

55:58.120 --> 55:59.280
"Yes, it is"

55:59.520 --> 56:01.080
-Lou?
-What?

56:03.360 --> 56:04.720
"You're always saying

56:04.720 --> 56:06.640
"That you want to be free

56:06.880 --> 56:09.120
"But I'll come running back"

56:28.120 --> 56:30.080
Why were you singing that song?

56:30.080 --> 56:32.440
-Song?
-Why were you singing that song?

56:32.440 --> 56:33.320
I was singing?

56:33.320 --> 56:36.160
Did they put you up to this?
Why did you sing that song?

56:36.160 --> 56:37.040
What're you talking about?

56:37.040 --> 56:40.080
-You don't know what I'm talking about?
-No, I don't.

56:40.080 --> 56:43.640
You don't know what I'm talking about?

56:58.920 --> 57:00.040
Hey, you!

57:11.120 --> 57:12.760
Syrian Aramaic.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.440
How clever.

57:16.080 --> 57:17.000
Jesus.

57:19.360 --> 57:20.880
It's true what I said.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.920
I do know who you are.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.080
Azazel.

57:25.600 --> 57:27.120
Where'd you get that?

57:27.640 --> 57:29.080
From Milano's place?

57:29.560 --> 57:31.440
You found something up there.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.320
Well, some things, pal, you shouldn't know.

57:35.680 --> 57:36.880
Like what?

57:37.760 --> 57:38.800
Like what?

57:39.640 --> 57:42.680
If you know, you should never, ever tell.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.160
Beware of my wrath.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.040
Well?

59:12.240 --> 59:14.160
What were you doing back then?

59:15.480 --> 59:18.320
-What are you talking about?
-You were singing.

59:19.600 --> 59:20.600
No.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.440
-I wasn't singing.
-You were.

59:22.440 --> 59:25.320
Lawrence and Mike were singing
some '60s thing.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.560
There you go.

59:27.600 --> 59:30.480
I wasn't singing it. I hated the fucking '60s.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.680
I wasn't singing.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.200
I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.

59:42.120 --> 59:45.800
Your father, mother, they're dead,
their lives were ruined, your life's ruined.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.200
I'm very sorry about that.

59:47.200 --> 59:51.200
But I gotta know what's going on.
If this thing is what it seems to be...

59:51.560 --> 59:54.800
...if this thing is what the book says
that it is, then....

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.520
Is this for real? Do you believe this stuff?

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.440
I believe more is hidden than is seen.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.520
I believe what I see. I'm trying to get
my mind around what I just saw.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.200
Something...

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.680
...threatened me.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.200
Reese threatened me in Aramaic.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.120
What else did Reese say?

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120
I'm asking the questions here.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.040
You answer the questions I ask.
Because if I don't know what's going on--

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.200
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.920
It's like the Mafia. They don't even exist.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.280
Okay...okay.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.560
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.200
So where are they from?
Who the hell are they?

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.040
There are certain phenomena...

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.360
...which can only be explained
if there is a god...

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.920
...and if there are angels.
And there are. They exist.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.760
Some angels were cast down. A few
were punished by being deprived of form.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.360
They can only survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.440
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is played out.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.640
That's it?

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.400
Come on, get out of here.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.560
Come on.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.280
I mean....

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.880
Miss Milano, I'm just a cop, okay?

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.240
I'm a detective.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.480
My work is based upon evidence, facts.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.280
Mine, too. Mine, too.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.640
Aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.840
So you're saying that...

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.840
...Edgar Reese is actually--

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.560
At the time you knew him,
he was not himself.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.480
-He was Azazel?
-Yes, Azazel.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.280
Sadistic, left-handed, likes to sing.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.000
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.760
You got his attention.
He tried to get inside you.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.200
He shook your hand. That didn't work,
so now he'll try to find some other way.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.560
Like he did with your father?

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.680
How do we fight him? ls it possible?

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.920
I believe it is. And I'm not alone.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.440
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.200
These people know the--

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.640
We believe that God limited demons
and made them mortal.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.400
He put a few of us here to fight them.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.120
Us? Us who?

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.600
Who, us?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.280
You're saying I'm one of these people?

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.120
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.400
You're just doing your job.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.360
Okay.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.800
Touche.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.560
So these demons are mortal?
They can be killed?

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.280
-By the right person.
-Who is?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.480
This is religion, Mr. Hobbes.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.120
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man--

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.760
-Or woman.
-Yes.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760
It could be you, me, anybody?

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.240
The right person of the right character
with the right knowledge....

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.320
So, this is what you've been doing.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.920
You've been preparing for this,
haven't you?

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.440
Can I ask you something personal?

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.720
Everything's personal if you're a person.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.720
Is this why you live alone?

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.560
There's a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.920
That's true.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.280
I mean...

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.960
...if I had someone, I'd want to share
my life and thoughts, and work with them.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.120
If I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have that right.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.920
You can talk to me.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.560
You don't have to. I'm not saying that....
I'm not, you know....

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.720
Do whatever you want to do. I'm just
saying you can talk to me if you want.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.880
Thanks.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.640
That's a very nice thing to say.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.960
I've got to go.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.960
I hope I've been helpful.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.640
-Thanks for listening.
-Thank you.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.840
I'm sorry.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.080
I was about to tap you on the shoulder.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.400
You're a friend of John Hobbes, right?

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.480
I'm Jay Reynolds.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.000
You know?

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.600
How lovely.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.800
You're not just Hobbes' chippy.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.640
Have we met?

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.520
You seem vaguely familiar.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.080
Come on...

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.320
...tell me.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.160
I'm about to find out anyway.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.120
Foreplay.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.280
Watch out.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.680
No, you don't!

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.360
Please, help me!

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.920
Go! Go!

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.000
-Open up!
-Go!

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.400
Jesus, are you all right?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.720
Are you all right?

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.880
Thanks for coming.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.600
I ran.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.040
He came after me and I ran.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.280
Maybe you weren't ready yet.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.920
That's the point. You have to be ready.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.200
You know what it is?

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.120
I never believed this day would come.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.320
I thought God would make it up to me.
I'd be good...

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.840
...and God would show me
an angel instead.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.200
Do they know who you are?

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.720
We shouldn't be seen together.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.480
Not anymore.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.360
Wipe your tears.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.640
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.080
How're you doing?

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.480
Fine.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.640
Murders not getting you wound up?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.760
Bag the chocolates. You ain't got
to talk to me sideways. What's up?

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.160
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were killed?

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.360
Where was l?

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.280
Am I a suspect?

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.400
Sit down.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.720
Not to me, you're not.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.760
But....

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.040
Lieutenant, you know....
What is it, the phone records again?

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.399
What do they think I did?

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:22.040
I committed murder, then called home,
then ran home and answered my phone?

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.720
No, it's something else.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:25.760
Your prints.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.640
My prints?

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.279
On what?

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.800
On that fucking little coin of yours.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:34.279
-Where?
-Noons' place.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.399
Shit.

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:48.760
This is a frame-up.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:49.840
Is it?

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.640
Anybody could have got those coins.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.600
They could've got them
when I was at the store or something.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.600
They could've taken them off my desk.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.760
We always said it could be a cop.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.200
We did always say that.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.439
I'm not stupid, you know.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.479
I know you know more than you're saying.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.840
So tell me.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.920
You don't really want to know.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.200
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even want to know.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.439
Try me.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.080
You remember Robert Milano?

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.520
Listen to me.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.120
This is exactly what happened to him.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.279
He was framed.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.520
I'll give you some advice.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.880
Let go of it for a couple of hours.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.399
Go home.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.279
See your family.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.200
Take a load off.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.280
The hell with Stanton.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.560
The hell with all of them.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.560
Nobody likes to get
the shit kicked out of them.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.000
Nobody likes to get hit from every angle.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.240
But eviljust keeps on coming.
You know what I mean?

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.800
You saw it before, but now...

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.480
...it's in your face, laughing at you.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.120
-Hi, Unc.
-Hey, Sam.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.760
How're you doing?

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.080
Hi, Mr. Hobbes.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.520
You're home early today.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.680
For a change.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.120
-Did you move my address book?
-What?

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.200
No.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.360
What?

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.320
What's wrong with your eye?

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.560
Who hit you in the eye?

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360
I fell.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.960
You fell?

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.960
I fell, or something.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.200
People don't fall down and get a black eye.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.720
-No?
-No.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.560
All right, it's okay.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.120
It's okay. Look....

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.640
What happened?

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.360
Sammy hit me.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.520
What?

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.360
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.640
He didn't mean to.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.320
It was an accident. It was an accident!

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.960
John...John!

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.200
Sam?

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.120
Where's Toby?

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.200
Outside, I guess.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.880
Okay, go back in the house.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.600
-Toby?
-Hey, Hobbes.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.800
Leave my family alone, you hear me?

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.440
Go back in the house.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.840
-What's going on?
-Go back in the house!

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.160
-You leave my family alone.
-Why?

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.880
You came after me.
Now I'm coming after you and yours.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.520
Toby, you all right?

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.480
Go right home. Go.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.000
-Okay, I will.
-Run!

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.960
What's the matter, pal?
Are you afraid to fight me?

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.960
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.760
Come on, Hobbes.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.400
Put the gun down.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.400
I knew you'd come out.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.200
Put the gun on the ground!

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.800
I know you, Hobbes.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.440
Set the gun down, sir!

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.120
Put the gun down!

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.680
"Yes, it is

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.240
"Time

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.520
"ls on my side"

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.120
Hey, pal.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.760
Wake up, Hobbes.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.640
I'm not that easy to kill.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.960
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.400
What are you going to do, arrest me?
What'll you tell Stanton?

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.240
I'd love to hear that one.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.360
It's me you want, isn't it?

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.560
Why don't you just kill me?

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.560
But I'm still having fun.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.240
Aren't you still having fun?

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.480
He was standing in the street,
yelling at him...

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.320
...shooting at him.
Finally, when the officer....

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.720
I guess that's it.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.440
There's no question
that the dead man shot first?

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.960
No question at all. My wife saw it too,
if you want to ask her.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.320
A schoolteacher.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.480
What am I going to say?

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.120
What am I going to do?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.080
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.120
But his gun was filled with blanks.
He got the gun out of a stolen car.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.760
-It was a setup.
-A setup?

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.360
That's right. A setup.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.240
He set it up for you to kill him?

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.520
Committing suicide by--

01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.680
Excuse me.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.080
What the hell are you doing out here?

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.040
You take Sam home, lock every door,
every window....

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.640
You don't let anybody in. Can you do that?

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.280
Can you remember that? All right, do it.

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.800
-Johnny?
-Yeah?

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.720
Are you mad at me or something?

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.040
No, Art. Never. Just....

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.880
Do what I told you.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.080
Hate to see the mighty fall,
you know what I mean?

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.880
Now it's letters. Fuck you, Lou.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.680
I told you, it's a cult.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.760
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cult.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.400
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.560
Trying to send some kind of message.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.880
The killer's sending a message?

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.680
Hobbes....

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.880
This time, you are the killer.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.400
Yeah, sort of.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.000
No fucking "sort of."

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.360
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.560
We're going back to the precinct. Now.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.200
Tonight, another shocking murder
in the city.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:22.600
A well-respected schoolteacher
opened fire on an off-duty police officer.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.000
The officer...

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.040
...John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.440
Our report now, from the scene.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.160
We're on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.880
Close the door.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.080
Detective Hobbes shot and killed
a high-school math teacher.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.320
The police have not yet identified him.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.360
According to witnesses,
the man started shouting at Hobbes...

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.440
...who was off duty at the time.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.360
I talked to the schoolteacher's wife.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.600
He got married four months ago.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.920
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.600
So much for suicide by a cop!

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.480
The shooting team will need your gun.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.280
I'll get the hearing as soon as I can.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.360
People want the world to make sense.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.800
If the only way I can get the world
to make sense for me is to arrest you...

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.200
...then I'll have to do it.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.680
Get the fuck out of here.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.280
-It was a clean shoot.
-Yeah, I know.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.200
It doesn't help, but I know.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.720
Coffee?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.200
No, thanks.

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:17.120
Want to talk? From where I sit, we're
dealing with shit that ain't in the manual.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.640
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Can you tell me that?

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.760
What's the point of life?

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.560
-"The point"?
-Yeah.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.680
-"Of life"?
-Yeah.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.280
The point of life.... You want a cigarette?

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.480
No, thanks.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.440
The point of life is we catch bad guys.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.360
That's what I used to think.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.800
It's not good enough.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.520
You can shoot me for talking like this, but--

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.800
It's two o'clock in the morning.
You can talk any way you want.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.320
What are we doing here?
You know what I'm saying?

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.720
Why do we even exist?

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.760
Us.

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.440
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.840
Yeah, it could be.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.120
I have a hard time believing that we're...

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.720
...part of some huge...

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:26.240
...moral experiment, you know,
conducted by a greater being than us.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.520
If there's a greater being than we are,
why does he give a shit about us?

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:34.080
There are five billion of us.
We're like ants. Do we care...

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.560
...what ants do, from a moral standpoint?

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.800
"Ants"? No.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:42.040
I'm following you,
but at the same time I'm losing you.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.280
Are you heading someplace here?

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.880
That's my point.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.960
Are we headed someplace?

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.560
If we don't figure it out....

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.760
Maybe if you figure it out...

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.440
...you die.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.360
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.400
...you don't get to hang around anymore.
You get promoted.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.880
Meanwhile, Delores...

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.240
...says we're put here to do one thing.

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.400
One thing?

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.320
What's that?

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.960
It's different. It's different for everybody.
Hers is lasagna.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.480
Lasagna?

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.720
And just one thing, not two or...?

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.400
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.480
But it's like...

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.800
...when a moment comes...

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.280
...we either do the right thing...

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.160
...or wrong.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.160
When do you know
when your moment comes?

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.880
So, like this could be it for me?

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.080
That's the beauty. You never know.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.040
-Hello?
-John?

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.600
Is that you?

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.240
Hi. I just wanted to see if you were okay.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.680
I'll call you back. I'll call you later.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.720
That was the killer.
We'll arrange things later.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.360
I'm going home.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.400
Yeah, fuck it.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.400
I killed someone.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.760
He got me to kill an innocent man.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.800
I know.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.840
What do they want, Gretta?

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.240
Just tell me what they want.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.640
The demons?

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.000
They want the fall of civilization.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.480
"The fall of Babylon, " as they put it.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.640
-The whole thing?
-Yeah.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.120
They're doing a goodjob, aren't they?

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.720
You know, after I shot the teacher...

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.120
...Azazel moved to someone else.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.520
Are you sure? After death?

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.400
I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.560
Listen to this.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.520
I was looking through
one ofyour father's books...

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:28.120
...and it says "outside"...
I guess that means outside the body.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.440
"Outside, they can survive
for one breath only. "

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.680
A Hebrew text says that the breath
can carry them for 500 cubits.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.560
I never knew what it meant.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:41.160
A cubit, that's a distance
or something, right?

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160
From your elbow to your fingertips.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.080
So 500 cubits would be what?
About a sixth of a mile?

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.320
Yeah, well, you're right then.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.680
They are limited in certain ways.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.480
What are you thinking?

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.600
I don't know.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.240
I don't know. Are you okay?

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.320
Yeah.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.560
All right. Well, then...

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.440
...maybe I'll check up on you tomorrow.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.840
Good night.

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.040
Good night.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.240
Good morning, Sam.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.680
Good morning, Sam.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.120
Oh, hi, Uncle John.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.200
Oh, hi.

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.480
-Thanks for tucking me in last night.
-You're welcome.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.080
We sent Michael Aaron to the scene...

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.200
...where he'll be ready with a live report
shortly. We'll be right back.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.080
Were you asleep when I tucked you in?

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.000
I don't know. All I remember
was somebody tickling me.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.640
Tickling my chest.

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.000
Why'd you write that?

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.400
-Where's your father?
-In the bedroom.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.880
He's a sleepyhead.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.960
Ifyou watched the national news
just last week...

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.440
...you might have seen
a similar case in Boston...

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.080
...of a decorated cop accused of murder.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.440
Hello?

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.400
Have you seen the news?

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.640
The cop was shooting first.
And he kept on shooting.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.480
Lou's coming to get you.

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.640
He'll bring you down
for more conversation.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.960
-Lou?
-No.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.480
-They get him yet?
-No. Not yet.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.800
I gotta go.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.560
Here. Put these clothes on.
Get dressed right away.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.920
-Why?
-Just do what I tell you, please!

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.240
Are you ready?

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.560
Almost. What's going on here?

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.040
We're just going to play
a little trick on somebody.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.360
Cool.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.000
We're going out the window.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.480
What about my dad?

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.840
He's sleeping. He's still asleep.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.120
-Excuse me, Sister. How're you doing?
-Good.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:54.440
Good.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.240
Does "apocalypse" mean anything to you?

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.080
Sure it does.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.040
"Apocalypse" was the Greek word
for "revelation."

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.840
"Revelation"?

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.160
-You mean like the book of the Bible?
-Yes.

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.320
Revelation.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.040
All right. Thank you.

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.680
Pack of cigarettes.

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.120
-Any special kind?
-No, any kind.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.440
Okay, out of five.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.680
Detective Hobbes?

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.880
Sir, you forgot your change.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.440
Detective Hobbes.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.320
I want to talk to you.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:03.280
Go, Sam. Run! Down the stairs,
down the stairs! Go!

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.360
All units in the area--

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.120
Why don't you close that coat up?

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.000
Cigarettes?

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.040
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.280
I did quit and they are bad for you.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.240
You know what's going on?

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.480
The police think that I did some bad things.

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:20.000
-You are the police.
-Not anymore.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.920
Why do they think you did that?

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.080
Because....

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.280
Because somebody...

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.960
...made it look like I did.

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.320
I once saw that on a show.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.560
I want to talk to you
about something else, too.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.520
About your dad.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.200
He's not asleep, is he?

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.560
No, son. He's not asleep.

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.960
Did it hurt?

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.800
I don't think so.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.040
-Do you think he's gonna go to Heaven?
-Yes.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.760
Yes, I do.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.200
If anybody deserves to go to Heaven,
it's your dad.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.440
I think so, too.

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:51.360
We've got no place else to go.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.040
This is my nephew, Sam.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.680
Okay. Hi, Sam.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.760
Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.120
You're in your pajamas.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.480
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm glad you're here.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.280
Why don't you go over there
by the fireplace and get warm.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.880
Azazel wrote on his chest.

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.600
Unless I do something--

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.320
I'll get you a coffee.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.440
Thank you.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.840
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but let me...

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.920
...let me run this by you, okay?

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:30.800
After the host body dies...

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.960
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.360
At the same time...

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:40.120
...Azazel says to me when he moves
as spirit no man can resist.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.680
So someone he can't get into by touch,
he can still get into by spirit.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.400
Because, if when he's in spirit form...

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:52.080
...he's fighting for his life,
he's going to be that much more powerful.

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.920
Please tell me what you're going to do.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.440
Whatever I do...

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.920
...l have to make sure
that you and Sam are safe.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.720
Will you take him somewhere...

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.400
...nobody knows about?

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.360
Even me.

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.320
Listen....

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.160
I gotta go.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.080
You're gonna stay with Gretta
for a little while.

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.800
Maybe for a long while.

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.400
And I want you to remember this:

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.680
Whatever people say about me...

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:44.920
...or whatever I do...

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.440
...l just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:51.880
Because I love you.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.160
You understand?

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.360
I'm gonna go back to sleep...

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:05.320
...and when I wake up
everything is gonna be just the way it was.

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.400
Thank you.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.800
You know what this means, right?

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.520
I'm ready.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.840
Hey, Jonesy, how're you doing?

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.560
Look, I'm worried, man.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.120
What are you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.960
I'm going nowhere.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.600
I'm taking a long drive...

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.520
...where nobody will find me...

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.120
...and sit by the water and think.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.440
I gotta ask you something.

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.120
Yeah, shoot.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.560
We've been partners a long time.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.360
Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.920
So, is there anything you gotta tell me?

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:59.320
Yeah, remember what
we were talking about the other night?

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.880
When the moment comes...

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.640
...you know it.

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.840
Be careful, okay?

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.080
I'll see you, partner.

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.600
Yeah, you too.

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.640
Be good.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.360
You're probably wondering:
What am I doing?

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:48.200
This is where things get a little tricky.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.440
It'sjust him and me now.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Hobbes versus Azazel.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.760
I thought I had him.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.080
But he thought he had me, too.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:50.920
Come on out.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.240
I know you're here.

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.040
I knew you'd come.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.640
Haven't you done enough?

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.400
You made me kill an innocent man. You...

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.240
...murdered my brother!

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.400
Come out, you son of a bitch!

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.400
How much more fun can you have!

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.560
Jesus, Hobbes.

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.560
What are you talking about?

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.480
I didn't do any of that.

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.920
Me, I'm the poor schmo
they sent up here to bring you in.

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.600
So it's you now.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.080
It's me.

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.040
Who'd you expect it'd be?

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.040
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.520
I know you've got one.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.320
Or what?

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.120
You'll shoot me?

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.240
Where is the fun in that?

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.000
Fuck you, huh?

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.400
You're making me do this.

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.000
Now, drop the goddamn gun.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.720
Do what he says, Hobbes.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:18.920
Jonesy?

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.160
Who else is out here, huh?

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.840
Lou? Tiff? Come on out!

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.760
No, it's just the two of us.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.400
The gun, Hobbes.

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.040
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.000
You know I didn't do any of it.

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.720
I know that, Hobbes.

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.280
We both want to believe you,
but we've gotta bring you in.

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.080
Stan....

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.040
I don't know if I can do this.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.200
What the fuck you talking...?

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:39.120
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods....

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.200
We drive his car into the lake.
End of story. What's wrong with that?

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.200
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:47.560
He did it, fine.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.520
He didn't do it, even better.

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:53.320
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun!

01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.880
Jonesy?

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:03.000
Put the goddamn gun down.

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.000
Okay.

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.200
Thank you.

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.760
I'm sorry, Stan.

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:40.960
Been on the force so many years you think
you've seen it all, but you haven't.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:42.840
Life always gives you one more surprise.

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.040
One more.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.960
Sometimes it's a big one.

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.840
Azazel.

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.680
I'm your partner, man.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.360
You're free. Run.

01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.680
Keep thinking, Hobbes.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.000
How about that!

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.600
Jonesy's fucked. He just killed his boss.

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.280
Jonesy's fucked!

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:16.760
You're fucked!

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:18.560
One at a time, huh?

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.080
That's how we do it. One by one.

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.680
Olly-olly-oxen-free!

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.200
"Time

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.840
"ls on my side

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.160
"Yes, it is

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:36.240
"Time

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.720
"ls on my side"

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.640
You like the Stones, Hobbes?

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:43.840
I bet you didn't, you big Monkee-fan pussy.

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.400
Time's up!

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.480
See the deal?

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.240
If I kill you...

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.200
...it's just the final...

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.080
...pathetic chapter...

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.800
...in the life of a disgraced hero.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.880
Just one more piece of shit, human scum.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.080
But...

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.560
...turn it around.

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.320
If I die...

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.400
...l enter you...

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.600
...put 20 more murders on your tab...

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.840
...before you go down.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:32.080
Maybe your nephew or that...

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.680
...chippy you were talking to.

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:39.840
How do you want to do this?
I die, you die?

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.240
What's maximum fun? Can you guess...

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.760
...what maximum fun is?

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.320
Sure you can.

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.520
Now that I've played you
from the outside...

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.400
...maximum fun is...

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.640
...l become you.

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:31.280
You got me, Hobbes. You got me good.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.280
But I gotta ask you something.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:38.520
You wouldn't let me kill myself.
Why is that?

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.320
Because I need more time.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.080
Time for what, asshole?

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.600
Five hundred cubits.
That's a long way, Azazel.

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.000
If Jonesy dies too fast...

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.960
...as powerful as you are...

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.960
...l might never get away from you.

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:56.000
Oh, he's catching on.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.120
What? You think you're going to win?

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.640
God willing.

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:09.600
You never know.

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.200
Let me ask you something.

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:24.600
Why do you think...

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.840
...Milano...

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.240
...came all the way out here...

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.000
...in the middle of nowhere?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.040
To die, the little chickenshit.

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.000
I don't think so.

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.680
I think that he wanted to do...

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:41.880
...what I'm going to do.

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.080
-Only he couldn't pull it off.
-Pull what off?

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:46.800
Oh, come on, Azazel.

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:49.880
Open your eyes.

01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:53.120
Look around sometime.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.760
Here we are in this beautiful place...

01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:00.600
...not another human being
around for miles.

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:02.920
It's just you and me.

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.600
What is this? You don't smoke anymore.

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:20.600
That's right. I don't.

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.880
You know why?

01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:27.520
Because cigarettes kill.

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:32.480
Especially cigarettes laced with poison.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.000
Bullshit.

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:40.480
Same poison that you used
to kill my brother.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:45.680
Fuck you.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.600
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.440
Isn't it so sweet?

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.800
We die together...

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:54.480
...just you and me.

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.120
"Time

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:06.480
"ls on my side

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.600
"Yes, it is"

01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.560
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.480
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:37.880
I'm sorry.

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.240
So, like I said at the start...

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:43.920
...l was beaten...

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:46.520
...outsmarted, poisoned...

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.720
...by Detective John Hobbes.

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.360
Can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands ofyears...

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:07.360
...and realize you're actually going to die...

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:11.880
...because some self-righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world?

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.360
Yes, a demon can die...

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.080
...and Hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game.

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.680
So what?

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:25.440
The war isn't over, I promise you.

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.040
Not by a long shot.

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:47.680
You forgot something, didn't you?

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.000
At the beginning I said
I was going to tell you...

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.080
...about the time I almost died.

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.520
See you around.
