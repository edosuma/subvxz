25:41.670 --> 25:42.802
- I'd love to.

26:09.437 --> 26:13.136
- "Use the accompanying diagram
to solve exercises 5 and 6.

26:14.747 --> 26:18.359
"So given J equals K,

26:18.489 --> 26:22.189
P.J. equals P.K."

26:22.319 --> 26:26.106
Ugh. This is not
the geometry that I remember.

26:26.236 --> 26:28.238
- This is impossible.
- [sighs]

26:28.369 --> 26:29.936
- We'll get it.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.372
I think I just need
a little break.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.113
- It's due tomorrow.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.289
- Guys, I remember
how to do this.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.508
- Really?

26:37.639 --> 26:39.423
- Yeah. It's not
that surprising.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.122
I mean, I only did it
a couple of years ago.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.211
- Uh-huh.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.300
- I got to get
dinner started.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.736
- Hey, Mom,
why don't we order in tonight?

26:47.867 --> 26:49.129
It's on me.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.397
- Can we order Chinese?

26:59.008 --> 27:00.357
- Sure.

27:00.488 --> 27:01.881
Go grab a menu.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.236
Someone's feeling
a little generous.

27:09.366 --> 27:10.759
- I decided to go see Courtney
about getting a job.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.805
- Oh, really?

27:12.935 --> 27:15.198
- Yeah, so going to be doing

27:15.329 --> 27:16.547
some landscaping work
around town,

27:16.678 --> 27:19.333
and Courtney
gave me an advance.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.074
- Well, that was nice
of her.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.250
I heard she's very successful.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.556
You could learn
a lot from her.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.819
- Yeah.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.171
And, you know,
I want to start

27:31.301 --> 27:33.216
helping out around here
a little bit more.

27:33.347 --> 27:37.264
I am, after all,
the man of the house.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.570
- Yes, I guess you are now.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.356
Well, just don't grow up
on me too fast.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.053
I'm still your mother,

27:44.184 --> 27:45.664
and I'm here for you
when you need me.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.230
- I know.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.492
Thank you.

28:25.399 --> 28:27.183
- Hello there.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.098
- Hi.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.361
Sorry, I--I didn't mean
to disturb you.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.581
- Oh, don't be silly.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.843
Just enjoying the view.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.628
You're new, aren't you?

28:37.759 --> 28:39.630
- Yeah.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.155
Yeah, I just started working
for Courtney yesterday.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.331
- Well, she sure knows
how to pick them.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.595
Can I get you a drink?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.684
Beer? Wine? Cocktail?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.381
- No.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.122
I haven't even started yet.
I'm fine.

28:54.776 --> 28:55.734
- Okay, we can have
a drink after.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.300
There's no rush.

28:57.431 --> 29:00.042
My husband's out of town,
as usual.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.565
- Okay.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.524
- It's awfully hot
out here.

29:03.654 --> 29:04.917
Why don't we go inside?

29:05.047 --> 29:06.483
Oh, did I scare you?

29:06.614 --> 29:08.485
Is this your first time
doing this?

29:08.616 --> 29:10.487
- Doing what?

29:10.618 --> 29:11.793
- Don't worry.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.403
I'll take care of you.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.319
- Sorry...

29:17.538 --> 29:19.366
I--I need to leave.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.287
- I understand, Karen.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.202
It won't happen again.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.638
[door opens and closes]
- Courtney!

29:30.769 --> 29:32.074
- Ooh, can I call you back,
Karen?

29:32.205 --> 29:33.336
Thank you so much.

29:33.467 --> 29:34.773
I'm in here!

29:37.601 --> 29:39.255
- Something really
weird happened.

29:41.736 --> 29:44.347
- I just spoke to Karen,
who said that you ran out

29:44.478 --> 29:46.436
without finishing the job.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.961
- Yeah. I mean, she...

29:49.091 --> 29:50.789
she came on to me.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.878
Like, she...

29:53.008 --> 29:54.793
she tried to have sex with me.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.316
- I thought that Daniel
explained to you

29:56.446 --> 29:57.534
what the job was all about.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.798
- What?

29:59.928 --> 30:03.018
- Did you really think that I
was sending you to trim hedges?

30:03.149 --> 30:05.934
My clients aren't looking
for "yard work."

30:06.065 --> 30:07.806
Their husbands
can help them with that.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.372
They're looking for something

30:09.503 --> 30:11.592
that the husbands
can't give them,

30:11.722 --> 30:13.812
like what you gave to me.
- Are you kidding me?

30:13.942 --> 30:15.335
- Look in that drawer
and get the binder.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.516
Have a look through it.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.265
The women who come to me

30:32.395 --> 30:35.398
aren't looking to buy cosmetics
out of a catalogue.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.400
They're looking
to buy fantasies.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.185
That's what I give them.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.969
And I would think that
that would be something

30:41.100 --> 30:42.841
that would interest you
more than mowing lawns.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.843
- No. No way. I'm out.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.279
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.933
That's--that's not for me.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.935
I'm sorry.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.675
- Okay.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.155
Fair enough.

30:53.286 --> 30:55.941
But if you'll excuse me,

30:56.071 --> 30:57.464
I do need to find
somebody else for Karen.

30:57.594 --> 30:59.379
I like to keep
my clients happy.

30:59.509 --> 31:02.208
- No hard feelings then?

31:02.338 --> 31:03.687
- Of course not, sweetie.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.430
Goodbye, Jason.

31:08.562 --> 31:09.737
- Goodbye.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.018
- Yo, hold up.

31:30.149 --> 31:31.890
Hey.
- Hey, man.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.239
- Dude, what happened?

31:33.369 --> 31:35.067
- Nothing.

31:35.197 --> 31:36.764
- That guy come back?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.897
- No, just forget about it.
I got to get to class.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.729
- Why didn't you tell me
about Courtney?

31:45.860 --> 31:47.340
- Tell you what?

31:47.470 --> 31:49.472
- You know.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.257
- You went to see her.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.868
- Yeah, and she sent me
to some woman's house.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.219
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

31:57.350 --> 31:58.873
She tried to come on to me
and I bolted.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.875
- You...

32:01.006 --> 32:03.225
dude, you shouldn't
have done that.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.749
- I'm pretty sure having sex
for money is illegal.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.186
What was I supposed to do?

32:07.316 --> 32:08.709
- [scoffs]

32:08.839 --> 32:10.711
- What, you actually
enjoy doing it?

32:10.841 --> 32:12.582
- Sometimes.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.584
I mean, yeah.

32:14.715 --> 32:17.065
It's great if you don't
overthink it.

32:17.196 --> 32:19.067
[scoffs]

32:19.198 --> 32:22.027
I get to hook up
with beautiful women

32:22.157 --> 32:23.898
and make some money.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.335
I mean, how many guys
in here would kill

32:26.466 --> 32:28.033
to trade places with me?

32:28.163 --> 32:30.209
You just...

32:30.339 --> 32:32.428
you just got to be careful.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.865
But if it's not for you, man,
it's not for you.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.519
It's better to figure
that out now.

32:36.650 --> 32:37.781
Later.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.009
[knock on door]
- Yes?

32:48.140 --> 32:50.490
- Hi, I'm Amber Weston.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.144
You wanted to see me.

32:52.274 --> 32:55.016
- Hi, Amber.
I'm Nicole Johnson.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.410
- Nice to meet you.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.195
- Please, come in
and have a seat.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.589
I've been talking to sdents
this week

33:02.719 --> 33:05.374
that were friends
with Chad Griffith.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.855
He was your boyfriend,
wasn't he?

33:10.466 --> 33:11.859
- Yes, he was.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.082
- I'm so sorry, sweetie.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.694
- Chad's parents
won't tell me anything.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.739
- What do you mean?

33:22.870 --> 33:24.524
- About what the police
were saying.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.830
If there are any suspects
or anything.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.745
- Suspects?

33:28.876 --> 33:31.009
I thought he slipped
and hit his head.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.359
- Well, that's what people
are saying, but...

33:36.101 --> 33:39.017
the police asked me
if I knew anyone that...

33:40.192 --> 33:41.497
[sighs]

33:41.628 --> 33:43.325
...that wanted to hurt Chad.

33:44.326 --> 33:45.806
- Hurt Chad?

33:45.936 --> 33:46.981
- I knew something
was going to happen.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.635
[sighs]

33:48.765 --> 33:50.854
- What do you mean?

33:50.985 --> 33:52.987
- It doesn't matter now.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.990
- Was he doing
something illegal?

33:57.644 --> 33:59.124
You can tell me.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.393
- He told me he was
going to stop

34:07.523 --> 34:09.743
once he made enough money.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.571
He said he was going to stop.

34:11.701 --> 34:14.094
- Amber, you need to tell me
what Chad was doing.

34:17.359 --> 34:18.578
- He was...

34:20.319 --> 34:21.755
He was sleeping
with older women...

34:23.931 --> 34:26.107
for money.

34:26.237 --> 34:28.370
- Have you talked to the police
about this?

34:28.501 --> 34:30.284
- Yeah, but...

34:30.416 --> 34:32.853
I don't want to get any
of his friends in trouble.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.507
- Other boys
were doing this too?

34:35.638 --> 34:38.946
- We were going to go
get out of town.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.730
Start over somewhere new.

34:45.822 --> 34:46.909
I was...

34:48.216 --> 34:49.261
[sighs]

34:51.001 --> 34:54.353
I got to get back
to class now, so...

34:55.963 --> 34:58.444
- Amber.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.533
I'll talk to the police
and see what I can find out.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.318
- Thank you.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.673
[door closes]

35:17.854 --> 35:18.942
- Hey, Mom?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.728
- Hello, Jason.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.469
- Courtney.

35:23.599 --> 35:24.774
What are you doing here?

35:24.905 --> 35:26.515
- Hey.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.256
Courtney invited me over
for drinks tonight.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.128
Justine is spending the night
at Heather's.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.782
So if you want to order a pizza
or something, go ahead.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.698
- Actually, I was thinking
about going to Daniel's.

35:35.829 --> 35:36.960
Can I borrow the car?

35:37.091 --> 35:38.179
- Sure, honey.

35:40.355 --> 35:44.185
- You know, my husband's old
car is still in the garage.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.927
I thought I'd keep it just in
case I needed a spare one day,

35:47.057 --> 35:49.495
but why don't I
give it to Jason.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.627
- Really?

35:51.758 --> 35:53.368
- Courtney, that's too much.

35:53.499 --> 35:55.283
- Oh, well, look,
it's no big deal, really.

35:55.414 --> 35:56.937
It's just taking up space.

35:57.067 --> 35:58.895
I mean, you'd be doing me
a favor.

35:59.026 --> 36:00.245
It does need
a tune-up, though,

36:00.375 --> 36:02.899
and the tires need
to be changed soon.

36:03.030 --> 36:05.032
- Well, now that Jason
has his new job,

36:05.163 --> 36:06.555
he can take care of all
those grown-up problems.

36:07.991 --> 36:09.428
Jay, what do you think?

36:10.864 --> 36:12.344
- Sure.

36:12.474 --> 36:13.780
That's great.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.869
Thank you, Miss McQueen.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.436
- Don't mention it.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.873
You can pick up the keys
tomorrow.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.963
- Good night.
- You too.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.011
Are you expecting
something in return?

36:29.926 --> 36:31.406
- No strings attached.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.374
- [Nicole sighs]

36:42.504 --> 36:43.853
I needed this so much.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.507
- I hear you.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.205
How's the new job going?

36:49.119 --> 36:51.078
- I'm relieved to say
that I'm loving it.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.906
- Well, that's great, right?

36:53.036 --> 36:54.516
You didn't think you would?

36:54.647 --> 36:57.127
- I haven't worked full-time
since Jason was born.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.694
- Hmm.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.435
- After we lost Kyle,

37:00.566 --> 37:02.437
things got tight.

37:02.568 --> 37:05.440
I had some insurance money
in savings,

37:05.571 --> 37:08.051
but that's for the kids'
college.

37:08.182 --> 37:11.054
I was really worried
about going back to work.

37:11.185 --> 37:15.755
But now, I feel more confident
in having a career again.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.496
- That's because
you're a survivor.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.324
Like me.

37:19.454 --> 37:22.109
And I think that
deserves a toast.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.112
To sisters,
doing it for themselves.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.331
- Cheers.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.158
Mm.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.682
Speaking of,

37:29.812 --> 37:31.597
I hear you're getting
an award.

37:31.727 --> 37:32.902
- Oh, that's nothing.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.556
- The Entrepreneurial
Spirit Award?

37:34.687 --> 37:36.297
Sounds like something to me.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.081
- [laughs]
Well, Mayor Wiley

37:38.212 --> 37:40.258
is presenting the award
to me this weekend,

37:40.388 --> 37:42.042
and I'm having a party here.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.262
You have to promise
that you're going to come.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.654
- I wouldn't miss it.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.526
You're a real
community role model.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.179
- Oh, stop.
- No, really.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.094
You're a successful
businesswoman

37:51.225 --> 37:52.705
giving back
to the community.

37:52.835 --> 37:55.751
And you have amazing taste
in jewelry.

37:55.882 --> 37:57.492
- Well, one has to have
their priorities.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.364
- Cheers to that.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.459
[knocks]

38:09.243 --> 38:11.071
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.334
- Come on in. I've got
the car keys in the kitchen.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.385
- Look, Courtney,
I really appreciate this,

38:20.515 --> 38:22.430
but you know I can't
afford it right now.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.389
- Well, I'm sure your mom
can help out

38:24.519 --> 38:26.565
with the insurance
and the repairs.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.871
- Look, don't tell her
I said anything,

38:29.002 --> 38:32.135
but we've...we've really had
to watch our spending lately.

38:32.266 --> 38:34.747
- Oh, well,
that's not my business.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.532
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have suggested it.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.142
- Just, things have...

38:39.273 --> 38:40.840
things have been tough
since Dad died,

38:40.970 --> 38:43.625
and Mom's doing her best,

38:43.756 --> 38:45.279
but she's...

38:45.410 --> 38:46.541
I mean, she's not you.

38:46.672 --> 38:50.153
- Jason, I owe you an apology.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.199
I should have told you
more about this job.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.983
You were not prepared,

38:54.114 --> 38:55.637
and that was really
unfair of me.

38:57.683 --> 38:58.814
You know, I used to be
like your mom.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.599
What my mistake was

39:00.729 --> 39:02.165
is that I relied on my husband
for everything.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.909
- It couldn't have been easy
when he passed away.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.911
- It's been a struggle.

39:09.042 --> 39:10.739
I mean, I loved Jack to bits,

39:10.870 --> 39:13.873
but he was a dreamer and,
you know,

39:14.003 --> 39:15.918
he had grand ideas,

39:16.049 --> 39:18.051
but they weren't necessarily
that practical.

39:20.053 --> 39:23.056
Before he died,
he ran up a lot of debt

39:23.186 --> 39:24.666
that I didn't know about,

39:24.797 --> 39:26.886
and so by the time
we paid for his funeral,

39:27.016 --> 39:29.497
there was no more money
left in our savings.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.978
And the bank were ready
to take away our house.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.719
- That's...

39:33.849 --> 39:35.111
I'm sorry, that's terrible.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.201
- I'm not proud of it.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.247
If I didn't have
this extra income,

39:40.378 --> 39:43.163
I'd probably be out
in the street.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.341
- [sighs]
Well, look,

39:47.472 --> 39:50.953
seeing as I have a car
to take care of now...

39:52.738 --> 39:55.741
maybe you and I
can help each other.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.743
- Not if you're not
comfortable.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.875
I don't want my boys doing
anything they feel bad about.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.051
- But Daniel says
he really likes it, and--

40:02.182 --> 40:04.793
- Daniel's very popular
with my clients.

40:04.924 --> 40:08.667
- I just--I know the money
would take some stress off Mom,

40:08.797 --> 40:12.192
and I...I want to help
support my family.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.150
- Are you sure?

40:14.281 --> 40:15.848
- Yeah. Yes.

40:17.023 --> 40:18.111
I'm sure.

40:18.241 --> 40:19.460
- [sighs]

40:19.591 --> 40:20.896
Jason, thank you so much.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.898
That means so much to me.

40:23.029 --> 40:25.945
I'm very discreet,
and so are my clients.

40:26.075 --> 40:28.643
- Good, because I don't want Mom
or Justine knowing about this.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.863
- About what? You're just doing
a landscaping job.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.214
When you're ready,

40:34.344 --> 40:35.955
she's looking
for somebody special,

40:36.085 --> 40:37.957
and I think that you're exactly
what she needs.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.829
- All right.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.658
Thank you, Courtney.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.312
- Oh...

40:45.443 --> 40:47.183
don't forget your new
used car.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.101
Jason.

40:53.276 --> 40:54.974
You should be really proud

40:55.104 --> 40:56.454
of what you're doing
for your family.

41:03.635 --> 41:06.115
[door opens and closes]

41:40.193 --> 41:41.368
- Hello?

41:51.944 --> 41:53.162
Miss Harris?

42:01.519 --> 42:02.607
- Hello, Jason.

42:06.436 --> 42:08.047
- The door was open.

42:08.177 --> 42:09.265
- Stop right there.

42:27.501 --> 42:29.372
I want to get a look at you.

42:48.783 --> 42:50.089
Hmm.

43:23.557 --> 43:25.472
Take off your shoes.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.222
Now your shirt.

43:50.671 --> 43:52.064
Excellent.

43:54.762 --> 43:56.938
Take off your pants.

44:17.611 --> 44:19.569
Sit down.

44:38.414 --> 44:39.938
Now it's your turn.

44:40.068 --> 44:41.809
- at do you mean?

44:43.550 --> 44:45.683
- Courtney was right
You are adorable.

44:47.423 --> 44:49.687
Tell me what to do.

44:52.211 --> 44:54.430
- T-Take off your shirt.

45:04.136 --> 45:06.486
Now take your pants.

45:18.933 --> 45:20.239
- Now...

45:21.980 --> 45:23.372
tell me what you like.

45:26.419 --> 45:28.073
What turns you on?

45:33.992 --> 45:35.558
- I don't know.

45:35.689 --> 45:38.387
- You don't have to be afraid
of pleasure, Jason.

45:53.533 --> 45:54.708
- Miss Harris.

46:34.008 --> 46:35.140
- Your share.

46:35.270 --> 46:36.576
- Thank you.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.537
- You should buy your mom
something nice with that,

46:41.668 --> 46:43.322
like a...

46:43.452 --> 46:45.280
necklace or something.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.938
Your next client.

46:51.069 --> 46:52.244
- Great.

47:03.559 --> 47:05.344
- Oh, honey.

47:05.474 --> 47:07.128
You didn't have to do this.

47:07.259 --> 47:08.434
- Happy birthday, Mom.

47:08.564 --> 47:09.827
You deserve it.

47:12.612 --> 47:13.831
It's from the both of us.

47:14.962 --> 47:16.137
- Thank you.

47:16.268 --> 47:18.009
I love you both.

47:21.186 --> 47:22.970
- All right, get that ankle.
Get that ankle.

47:23.101 --> 47:24.319
Time.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.106
Jason, you and Billy
rotate them in.

47:28.236 --> 47:29.716
Okay, let's go,
20 seconds to get an ankle,

47:29.847 --> 47:31.022
then we switch it up.

47:31.152 --> 47:32.240
Ready?
[blows whistle]

47:39.073 --> 47:40.161
Time.
[blows whistle]

47:40.292 --> 47:41.423
Switch.

47:41.554 --> 47:42.816
- [gasps and pants]

47:55.873 --> 47:57.309
- Courtney been
riding you too hard?

47:57.439 --> 47:59.789
[laughs]
- Yeah, something like that.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.662
I've had a client
every night this week.

48:02.792 --> 48:04.533
I'm definitely going
to need a break soon.

48:04.664 --> 48:07.014
- Don't count on it.
You're fresh meat.

48:07.145 --> 48:09.147
At least the money's
not bad, right?

48:09.277 --> 48:11.192
- Yeah. I mean, you can't
complain about that.

48:11.323 --> 48:12.890
I can finally afford
to ask Clara out.

48:13.020 --> 48:15.501
[cell phone buzzes]

48:20.593 --> 48:21.681
Pizza boy?

48:21.811 --> 48:23.117
- [laughs]

48:23.248 --> 48:24.771
Some of the women,
they...

48:24.902 --> 48:26.947
they like role playing.

48:27.078 --> 48:28.601
I was a pool boy last week.

48:28.731 --> 48:29.907
- [laughs]

48:34.215 --> 48:35.913
[school bell ringing]
- You seem distracted, man.

48:36.043 --> 48:37.175
What's wrong?

48:37.305 --> 48:39.742
- I failed my biology test.

48:39.873 --> 48:42.093
I didn't have any time
to study this weekend.

48:43.529 --> 48:44.791
My mom is going
to kill me.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.314
- I can help you study.

48:46.445 --> 48:47.881
- Yeah? You good at biology?

48:48.012 --> 48:49.230
- Oh, yeah.

48:49.361 --> 48:51.015
I got lots of practice.

48:52.625 --> 48:54.279
- I'll catch you later,
all right?

48:59.327 --> 49:00.415
Hey, Clara.

49:05.725 --> 49:08.206
I was thinking that maybe

49:08.336 --> 49:10.817
you and me could go see a movie
this weekend or something.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.384
- I'm not going with you.

49:12.514 --> 49:14.255
- Wait, why?

49:17.345 --> 49:20.305
- I know what you and Daniel
are doing.

49:20.435 --> 49:22.089
You're disgusting, Jason.

49:22.220 --> 49:24.135
Just stay away from me.

49:24.265 --> 49:25.919
- Clara, wait.

49:26.050 --> 49:28.095
[cell phone buzzes]

49:33.187 --> 49:34.275
[sighs]

49:36.190 --> 49:37.800
- You ran away the other day.

49:37.931 --> 49:39.977
Kind of hurt my feelings.

49:40.107 --> 49:42.718
- I am so sorry
about that.

49:42.849 --> 49:45.634
I promise I am
all yours now.

49:45.765 --> 49:48.072
- Well, isn't that lovely.

49:51.336 --> 49:52.467
[moans]

49:59.039 --> 50:00.606
Oh, yes.

50:00.736 --> 50:01.999
[moans]

50:16.056 --> 50:17.405
[moaning]

50:27.111 --> 50:28.677
[gasps]
What's that?

50:28.808 --> 50:30.027
- I didn't hear anything.

50:32.725 --> 50:34.031
- Karen!

50:34.161 --> 50:35.423
- Oh, my God!

50:35.554 --> 50:36.642
Oh, God,
that's my husband.

50:36.772 --> 50:38.209
He's home early.

50:38.339 --> 50:40.298
- What should I do?

50:40.428 --> 50:41.821
- Get in the closet.
- Karen, where are you?

50:41.951 --> 50:43.083
- Get in the closet.

50:52.223 --> 50:54.138
- Why didn't you answer me?

50:54.268 --> 50:56.227
- Well, I didn't hear you.

50:56.357 --> 50:58.446
- So, whose car is that
parked out in the street?

50:58.577 --> 51:00.187
- Well, I have no idea.

51:01.580 --> 51:02.755
- Karen...

51:05.453 --> 51:08.674
what do you do
while I'm out of town?

51:08.804 --> 51:10.719
- What?
- Never mind.

51:10.850 --> 51:14.027
I don't want to argue
with you anymore.

51:14.158 --> 51:17.465
- I cook, I clean,
pick up your dry cleaning.

51:18.858 --> 51:19.989
And I think about you.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.557
I miss you.

51:34.047 --> 51:36.745
[moans]

51:36.876 --> 51:39.096
Oh, you know I love you.

51:41.010 --> 51:43.622
[moaning continues]

52:05.948 --> 52:07.646
- [sighs]

52:13.304 --> 52:14.392
- Where have you been?

52:15.871 --> 52:19.092
- I was out with Daniel.

52:19.223 --> 52:20.876
- Do you know what time it is?
- Yeah.

52:21.007 --> 52:22.748
Sorry.

52:22.878 --> 52:23.705
- If you're going
to be out this late,

52:23.836 --> 52:24.576
I'd appreciate a phone call.

52:24.706 --> 52:26.404
- All right.

52:26.534 --> 52:29.363
- I saw Mrs. O'Neill
at school today.

52:29.494 --> 52:31.452
She told me you failed
your test on Friday.

52:31.583 --> 52:33.976
- Yeah.

52:34.107 --> 52:36.327
It's not a big deal.
I can bring it up.

52:36.457 --> 52:39.112
- This isn't like you.

52:39.243 --> 52:40.983
- I'm sorry, okay?
It was a hard exam.

52:41.114 --> 52:42.637
What do you want me to do?

52:42.768 --> 52:44.248
- I've been your mother
for 18 years,

52:44.378 --> 52:46.598
and I know when you're hiding
something from me.

52:49.209 --> 52:50.732
- Okay.

52:50.863 --> 52:52.691
What are you talking about?

52:54.432 --> 52:56.129
- I thought things
were getting better.

52:58.218 --> 53:01.482
I can only help if you tell me
what's going on.

53:04.398 --> 53:05.834
- Mom...

53:14.060 --> 53:16.280
everything's fine.

53:16.410 --> 53:17.846
Okay, I'm...

53:17.977 --> 53:19.848
I'm sorry about the exam.

53:19.979 --> 53:22.329
I'm sorry for...

53:22.460 --> 53:23.809
being out late.

53:23.939 --> 53:25.419
I'm sorry for not calling.

53:25.550 --> 53:26.725
- Honey--
- I'm sorry for everything.

53:39.781 --> 53:41.348
[door closes]

53:41.479 --> 53:43.045
- I didn't get paid
for last night.

53:43.176 --> 53:44.656
- I just spoke to Karen.
She told me what happened.

53:44.786 --> 53:45.918
Are you okay?

53:46.048 --> 53:47.528
- Yeah, her husband is crazy.

53:47.659 --> 53:49.661
I saw a gun in his
dresser drawer.

53:49.791 --> 53:51.184
How long has she been
doing this?

53:51.315 --> 53:53.447
- Karen is a very
lucrative client, okay?

53:53.578 --> 53:55.014
That marriage has been over
for years.

53:55.144 --> 53:56.363
Her husband's leaving
on Tuesday.

53:56.494 --> 53:58.191
She wants you
to come back then.

53:58.322 --> 53:59.671
Just get the money
up front this time.

53:59.801 --> 54:01.325
- No. Thank you.

54:01.455 --> 54:04.066
- Excuse me?
- I said no.

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:43.140
You just never know

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.229
what's going on
in people's lives.

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.666
They can seem perfectly normal
on the outside.

01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:49.494
But underneath...

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.104
- Excuse me.

01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:53.193
Can I steal Courtney away
for a second?

01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:54.978
I just want to grab some
pictures for the paper.

01:04:55.108 --> 01:04:57.110
- Of course.
- Please excuse me, Nicole.

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:03.900
- [sighs]

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.083
Do you know where
the restroom is?

01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:15.563
Thank you.

01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:26.618
Oh!
- Oh!

01:05:26.748 --> 01:05:28.446
- I'm sorry, I was looking
for the restroom.

01:05:28.576 --> 01:05:29.664
- It's right down there.

01:05:29.795 --> 01:05:30.839
- Thank you.

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:41.111
- Sorry, I got out
as soon as I could.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.069
- No worries.
- So, what's up?

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.853
Did your mom
say something?

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:47.639
- No, Mom's still over
at the party.

01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:50.207
- Oh.

01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:52.035
So, what's--what's the big
emergency?

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:54.385
- Do you know a guy
named Benjamin?

01:05:54.515 --> 01:05:57.431
- Yeah. Yeah, I know Benjamin.

01:05:57.562 --> 01:05:59.477
Did he come by?
Did he say something to you?

01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:01.479
- Well, yeah, he--

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:03.350
he was in the locker room
last night after you left.

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:06.397
He gave me my next client,
and then he freaked out on me.

01:06:06.527 --> 01:06:08.007
- Dude.

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:09.878
That kid is a psychopath.

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:12.185
You need to stay
away from him.

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:13.839
I think even Courtney
is scared of him.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.623
- Why does she
keep him around?

01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:17.974
- He kind of got her started.

01:06:18.104 --> 01:06:19.279
He needed her contacts,

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.629
and I guess she saw
an opportunity.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.284
But he sort of stepped out
on his own now.

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:26.025
Try to get me to work
for him instead.

01:06:26.156 --> 01:06:28.506
- Is that who hit you
the other day?

01:06:30.595 --> 01:06:31.988
- I told him to go to hell.

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:33.728
I'm not working for a lunatic
like that.

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:35.078
- Dude, we need to go
to the police then.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:36.427
- How do you think
they've got away with it

01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:37.906
all these years?
[cell phone buzzing]

01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:40.474
I mean, Courtney's probably
paying them off.

01:06:40.605 --> 01:06:42.302
Is that your next client?
- Yeah.

01:06:42.433 --> 01:06:44.565
Yeah, I should probably go.

01:06:44.696 --> 01:06:46.524
- All right, well, I'll head
back to the party, all right?

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:47.829
- All right.
Meet me back here?

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.222
- Yeah.

01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:08.720
- Hello.

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:10.156
Wasn't expecting you.

01:07:10.287 --> 01:07:12.158
- Hello, Karen.

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:13.594
It's been a while.

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:17.468
- Yes, it has.

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:19.296
- Courtney asked me
to give this to you.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.387
- Didn't realize
you still worked for her.

01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:25.650
- Yeah, from time to time.

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:28.957
I hear you're all alone
tonight.

01:07:30.263 --> 01:07:31.830
- Guess so.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.354
- Would you like
some company?

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:36.791
- Why not?

01:07:36.922 --> 01:07:39.011
You were always
my favorite.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.160
It's been a while.

01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:06.038
What's this?

01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:07.866
Oh! Ah!

01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:13.350

01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:53.129
- Benjamin.

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:58.482
Benjamin?
What happened?

01:08:58.612 --> 01:08:59.917
- She shot me.

01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:02.747
Karen shot me.

01:09:02.877 --> 01:09:04.705
- Well, we got to call you
an ambulance.

01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:06.446
- No!

01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:08.100
Gunshot wounds get reported
to the police.

01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:11.189
When they find Karen's body,

01:09:11.321 --> 01:09:13.453
they'll figure out
what happened.

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:15.760
- You're right.
- So call your friends.

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:18.415
You must have a client
who's a doctor.

01:09:20.024 --> 01:09:21.157
- Are you sure
that Karen's dead?

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:24.160
- Of course I'm sure.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:25.421
- I don't like mistakes.

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:27.466
- I don't make
mistakes.

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:29.687
- You sure about that?
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:31.254
- When you went to see Jason
at school,

01:09:31.384 --> 01:09:32.951
did you hurt him?

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.560
- What? No.

01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:35.997
- No?

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:40.567
- I scared him a little bit,
but I didn't hurt him.

01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:41.960
- I just wanted you
to talk to him.

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:43.701
- You wanted him
back in line.

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.832
I got him back in line.

01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:49.272
- You punched Daniel after I
sent you to go and talk to him.

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:50.621
- I'm not saying
I'm not going to do it.

01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:52.274
I'm just saying--

01:09:52.404 --> 01:09:54.494
- He was being difficult,
and now he's not.

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:56.192
Why are you bringing this up
right now?

01:09:56.322 --> 01:09:57.976
Please call someone.
- I didn't want him hurt.

01:09:58.106 --> 01:10:01.109
I didn't want
any of my boys hurt.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.068
- Sometimes things
get out of line.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.201
Accidents happen.

01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:07.855
Will you please
call someone?

01:10:07.986 --> 01:10:10.075
- Is that what happened with
Chad? Was that an accident?

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.338
- What are you talking about?

01:10:12.469 --> 01:10:13.513
- Did you kill him?

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:22.696
You did kill him.

01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:24.524
- What does it matter?

01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:26.439
He wasn't going to work
for you anymore.

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:28.528
- You're out of control.

01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:29.834
- And you're too soft.

01:10:29.964 --> 01:10:31.836
That's why you pay me.

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:33.794
I clean up after your messes.

01:10:33.925 --> 01:10:35.709
- I didn't want you to kill
him!

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.058
- God, please...

01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:40.497
Can you please call someone?

01:10:40.627 --> 01:10:42.803
- I can't believe
this is happening.

01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:45.415
I should never have gotten
involved with you.

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:47.025
- We watch out for each other.

01:10:47.155 --> 01:10:49.984
Courtney, please,
who else can you trust?

01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:51.464
- So you're not working
on the side

01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:53.379

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:54.598
Stealing from me?

01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:56.556
- Courtney, please.

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:58.602
Please.

01:10:58.732 --> 01:11:00.386
Just help me, please.

01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:01.953
- You're right, Benjamin.

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:04.216
I have gotten soft.

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:05.957

- I just--I had
something to do.

01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:04.145
- What exactly do you do

01:12:04.276 --> 01:12:06.365
that takes you out
of this house every night?

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:08.541
- Stuff. I don't know.

01:12:08.672 --> 01:12:10.326
I--I do stuff.
I have a life.

01:12:10.456 --> 01:12:13.241
- Stop lying to me.
- I'm not lying to you.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.766
I answered your damn question.
- Get back here.

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.289
- I have a big test
tomorrow.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.682
Daniel's coming over
to help me study.

01:12:18.812 --> 01:12:19.857
- I don't want you
to see him anymore.

01:12:19.987 --> 01:12:21.641
- Why?

01:12:21.772 --> 01:12:23.556
- He's a bad influence.

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:25.558
- No, he isn't. That doesn't
even make any sense.

01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:27.473
- I saw him do something
inappropriate.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.781
- Okay. What does that mean?

01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.652
- It means you're
not to hang around him.

01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:34.393
- You can't tell me who
I can and can't hang out with.

01:12:34.524 --> 01:12:36.090
- I can as long
as you live in this house.

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:38.136
- Well, then I won't live
in this house.

01:12:38.266 --> 01:12:40.225
I never wanted to live in this
house in the first place.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.618
I didn't want
to come here.

- You know why
we had to do that.

01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:45.622
- Yeah, I know the real reason
is because you couldn't stand

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:47.014
being there anymore
without Dad.

01:12:47.145 --> 01:12:48.712
