00:04.305 --> 00:07.041
Starlight: It's the ponies
from my old village.

00:07.075 --> 00:09.610
[laughing]

00:09.643 --> 00:12.313
Oh! It's only a dream.

00:12.346 --> 00:16.050
With my past, I should never
be in charge of anything.

00:16.084 --> 00:19.220
THEY'VE TAKEN MY SISTER AND I!
IT'S WORSE THAN LAST TIME!

00:19.253 --> 00:21.455
Chrysalis and the
Changelings are back.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.324
They've ponynapped all of
the most powerful ponies

00:23.357 --> 00:25.226
in Equestria.

00:25.259 --> 00:28.229
This is Thorax. He's
a reformed Changeling.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.698
They took Fluttershy?

00:30.731 --> 00:34.235
I think I have a pretty good
idea where she might be.

00:36.804 --> 00:40.308
* My little pony,
my little pony *

00:40.341 --> 00:42.243
* Aaaahhh

00:42.276 --> 00:44.312
* My little Pony

00:44.345 --> 00:46.714
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

00:46.747 --> 00:48.582
* My Little Pony

00:48.616 --> 00:51.185
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

00:51.219 --> 00:53.254
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

00:53.287 --> 00:55.423
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

00:55.456 --> 00:57.558
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

00:57.591 --> 00:59.560
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

00:59.593 --> 01:01.695
* To have my little pony

01:01.729 --> 01:04.498
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:04.532 --> 01:07.801
**

01:16.410 --> 01:19.380
* [scary music]

01:20.848 --> 01:23.651
Oh, this is so strange.
We're here and that's there

01:23.684 --> 01:27.255
and I clearly meant for us
to be there and not here.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.823
Oh, I can probably
explain that.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.460
Oh well, if at first
you don't succeed.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.762
Maybe we should come
up with a plan first?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.265
A what?

01:37.298 --> 01:39.367
You know, figuring out the
best way to do something

01:39.400 --> 01:41.802
before you actually do it?

01:41.835 --> 01:44.538
[laughing] Oh,
that's adorable.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.675
But, you see, unlike
you I can do anything.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.210
Actually...

01:49.243 --> 01:51.379
That's all very nice, but
really a waste of time.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.746
We have me.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.483
And what else could
we possibly need?

01:55.516 --> 01:59.587
A draconequis with magic AND
half a brain might help.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.455
Why are you here
again?

02:01.489 --> 02:04.425
I mean, it's not like you're
going to stop the Changelings

02:04.458 --> 02:06.560
by pulling a rabbit
out of the hat.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.563
At least my magic
can do something.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.898
The thing about
magic here is...

02:10.931 --> 02:12.600
Like this!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.602
For Fluttershy!

02:16.204 --> 02:16.870
Eeyah!

02:18.672 --> 02:20.174
[oinking]

02:21.675 --> 02:23.911
I've been trying to tell you.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.880
Nothing other than
Changeling magic works here!

02:26.914 --> 02:30.318
Chrysalis' throne is carved
from an ancient dark stone

02:30.351 --> 02:32.853
that soaks up outside magic
the same way Changelings

02:32.886 --> 02:35.723
soak up love. It's how
she keeps the hive safe.

02:35.756 --> 02:41.629
[chimes]

02:41.662 --> 02:46.234
So... What kind of
plan were you thinking?

02:46.267 --> 02:50.738
Without magic I have no idea.
But nopony else is coming,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.640
so somepony better
come up with something.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.376
Anypony?

02:56.910 --> 02:58.712
Anything?

02:58.746 --> 03:00.714
Hmmm.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.551
This throne. If we get into
the hive and destroy it,

03:03.584 --> 03:05.219
can we get our magic back?

03:05.253 --> 03:06.654
Uh-huh.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.789
Well, that's a terrible plan.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.625
How are we even supposed
to get to the hive?

03:11.659 --> 03:13.427
We walk?

03:14.728 --> 03:17.831
I haven't walked that
far in millennia.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.199
Ugh.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.474
Ugh. I don't know how any
of you manage not being able

03:26.507 --> 03:30.244
to disappear and reappear
whenever you want.

03:30.278 --> 03:34.548
Well, I for one definitely miss
you being able to disappear.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.750
Give Discord a break.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.520
None of us knew we weren't
going to be able to use magic.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.988
I did.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.624
If we get separated, it might
make sense to have a way

03:43.657 --> 03:46.026
to make sure we are
who we say we are.

03:46.059 --> 03:51.299
Ooo. Like a secret code.
How about if I say "We are"

03:51.332 --> 03:56.270
you say "Doomed?" Or you say
"Rescue" and I say "I'm--

03:56.304 --> 03:57.971
[crash]

03:58.005 --> 04:01.709
How about if we say "Klutzy"
and you say "Draconequis?"

04:01.742 --> 04:04.412
Klutzy draconequis.
Works for me.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.813
I'll definitely
remember it.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.683
[whistling wind]

04:19.360 --> 04:22.830
Trixie: OK. I am
definitely glad you came.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.566
I don't think we'd be able
to find our way without you.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.634
You definitely wouldn't.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.702
[rumble and slam]

04:28.736 --> 04:30.704
Um... Where's the way out?

04:30.738 --> 04:34.007
It's a Changeling Hive. It
shifts and changes like we do

04:34.041 --> 04:36.444
and we're the only ones
who can navigate it.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.947
It's total chaos to
non-Changelings.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.951
Well, it's decent chaos. I don't
know if I'd call it total.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.356
Discord: Are we sure that
I'll get my magic back

04:48.389 --> 04:51.525
when we destroy
this throne-thingy?

04:51.559 --> 04:53.861
If Thorax is
right, then yes.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.430
Well, that's reassuring.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.332
And how are we supposed
to destroy the throne

04:58.366 --> 04:59.433
when we find it?

04:59.467 --> 05:02.803
I... don't know.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.405
That's reassuring.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.377
I don't suppose you brought
any throne-destroying tools

05:09.410 --> 05:12.580
along with these
useless side show props?

05:12.613 --> 05:15.616
Asks the "lord of chaos"
who can't go for a walk

05:15.649 --> 05:17.918
without whining non-stop.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.020
Yes, but when the
throne is destroyed,

05:20.053 --> 05:23.123
I'LL be able to rip the
very fabric of reality

05:23.156 --> 05:25.993
to save our friends
while YOU'LL still be

05:26.026 --> 05:30.664
a self-absorbed,
below-average illusionist.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.501
SELF-ABSORBED?! Why you--

05:33.534 --> 05:35.936
CUT! IT! OUT!

05:35.969 --> 05:37.805
I'm just barely
keeping it together

05:37.838 --> 05:40.674
and it would be WONDERFUL if you
two could actually try to help

05:40.708 --> 05:42.443
instead of bickering like foals.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.113
OK.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.615
How can we help?

05:47.648 --> 05:50.484
Don't ask me! I couldn't
even handle giving advice

05:50.518 --> 05:53.821
at the Sunset Festival
and I HAD magic then!

05:53.854 --> 05:56.023
And the three of us
are as good as useless.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.526
At least Thorax knows
where we're going.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.893
Thorax: Um... guys?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.630
I think we're lost.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.465
Trixie: Aww, great!

06:04.498 --> 06:06.534
We might as well just
sit here and wait

06:06.567 --> 06:09.670
for the Changelings to
soak up all of our love

06:09.703 --> 06:12.806
or whatever gross thing
it is that they do.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.709
How often do you
all get hungry?

06:15.743 --> 06:19.179
Actually, I haven't
been since I met Spike.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.715
And Changelings
are always hungry.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.551
We can never get
enough love.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.619
Well, that's just super.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.922
But you aren't
hungry at all now?

06:28.956 --> 06:32.560
Once I made a few friends,
I guess I just sort of...

06:32.593 --> 06:35.496
forgot about the
whole feeding thing.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.932
Is that about the same
time your wings changed?

06:38.966 --> 06:40.133
I guess so.

sit around chit-chatting

about feeding and
not feeding.

Can you please lower your voice?

You're going to get
us all captured!

07:00.087 --> 07:02.122
Oh! You keep saying
that, but I haven't seen

07:02.155 --> 07:04.925

we got into this hive.

moments where we need a plan.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.112
What kind of plan?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.747
We have no magic

07:26.780 --> 07:28.882
and it's not like my illusions
are going to save us.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.819
Do you have any of
your smoke bombs?

need a new code word.

That was a pretty
good plan.

But we still don't
know where we're going.

didn't go with the rest.

in the hive,

no way past the guards.

of distraction.

I was just as surprised
as you are that I'm here.

When I heard that I'd be playing
for a bunch of Changelings,

09:17.825 --> 09:21.829

realized it was just one of you.

Unless you think maybe one of us
might be the real Fluttershy.

11:00.928 --> 11:05.799
That certainly would be a nasty
Changeling trick, wouldn't it?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.768
I'm the real one.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.903
I'm the real one.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.005
I'm the real
Fluttershy.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.775
[snivelling]

11:14.808 --> 11:19.046
We can't wait for Discord.
Between seeing him and Trixie,

11:19.079 --> 11:22.315
the castle will be
crawling with guards soon.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.952
But if we do manage to
destroy Chrysalis' throne,

11:24.985 --> 11:26.186
we'll need him.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.955
He could take on the
entire Changeling army

11:27.988 --> 11:29.857
by sneezing if he
wanted to.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.826
He's probably already
been captured.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.429
Hello? Fellow rescuers?

11:38.365 --> 11:41.301
We can't stay here. We've
got to find the throne!

11:41.334 --> 11:44.204
Oooh! I heard some
of the Changelings

11:44.237 --> 11:48.108
who were chasing me say
that they know where it is.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.743
Klutzy...

11:49.777 --> 11:55.315
Hmmmm? Oh, yeah haha. I can
be klutzy. Now, follow me!

11:57.184 --> 11:59.052
You know that's
not Discord, right?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.220
Obviously.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.225
This way! We're
almost there!

12:05.258 --> 12:07.995
I know this trick. If
he says to go left,

12:08.028 --> 12:09.529
we should definitely go right.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.932
He's leading us to a
swarm waiting to attack.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.835
[sigh]

12:14.868 --> 12:16.870
OK, I'll handle it.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.206
You two just get ready to
run into the other tunnel.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.975
Wait, what!? Trixie
you can't.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.778
I won't know what to do.
We've already lost Discord.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.114
I can't lose you too.
Without magic I--

12:27.147 --> 12:30.183
Starlight, you got us this
far with just my illusions

12:30.217 --> 12:32.552
and Discord's
annoying personality.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.789
You don't need magic to
figure out what to do next.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.291
I know you're afraid
to be in charge,

12:38.325 --> 12:42.529
but you're really good at it.
Listen to your best friend.

12:45.065 --> 12:49.536
Hey, Discord? Wanna see the new
trick I've been working on?

12:49.569 --> 12:53.106
I call it, "The
Changeling Catcher!"

12:53.140 --> 12:55.375
Run!

12:55.408 --> 12:56.443
[whoosh]

12:56.476 --> 12:59.479
**

13:06.019 --> 13:07.220
* [weak] Ta-daaa...

13:08.521 --> 13:11.058
**

13:11.091 --> 13:14.561
[panting]

13:14.594 --> 13:19.332
* [dramatic music]

13:19.366 --> 13:23.837
* [music quiets]

13:23.871 --> 13:26.874
**

13:26.907 --> 13:28.375
[splat]

13:28.408 --> 13:32.445
* [dramatic music]

13:32.479 --> 13:35.482
**

13:42.189 --> 13:48.862
[evil laugh] One little
pony all by herself.

13:52.199 --> 13:56.870
Oh, how will I ever
prevent this daring rescue?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.406
[hissing and snarling]

14:07.447 --> 14:13.353
Well, well, well. The Princess
of Friendship's sole pupil.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.323
Honestly, I didn't think
you were worth replacing

14:16.356 --> 14:18.425
with one of my drones.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.528
You won't get away with this!

14:21.561 --> 14:26.033
I already have. Nopony
is coming to save you.

14:26.066 --> 14:31.905
Your little squad was it,
and now there's just you.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.573
Thorax is still out there.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.443
Don't mention that traitor's
name in my Kingdom!

14:36.476 --> 14:40.380
He was a fool to leave and
even more a fool to return.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.084
When I find him he'll
learn just what happens

14:44.117 --> 14:46.653
to those who betray the hive.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.222
[whimper]

14:49.256 --> 14:52.559
And it seems I don't
have far to look, do I.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.095
[zap]

14:55.128 --> 14:56.263
Thorax!

14:56.296 --> 14:57.597
[hiss]

14:59.032 --> 15:02.035
[clanking]

15:05.072 --> 15:09.509
Very clever. And clearly Thorax
revealed to you the secret

15:09.542 --> 15:13.146
of my throne. I can't
have powerful ponies

15:13.180 --> 15:15.515
using their
abilities against me.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.450
Even with your
rather embarrassing

15:17.484 --> 15:20.487
little rescue attempt,
everything has gone

15:20.520 --> 15:23.323
according to MY plan.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.193
What plan? Why did
you do all this?

15:26.226 --> 15:28.428
So I could feed, of course!

15:28.461 --> 15:32.132
By replacing the most beloved
figures in Equestria,

15:32.165 --> 15:35.969
my drones will be able to store
all the love meant for them

15:36.003 --> 15:38.738
and return it here... to me.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.976
Everypony will do as I
command and my subjects

15:43.010 --> 15:47.147
and I will feed on their love
for generations! [evil laugh!]

15:52.485 --> 15:54.521
What if you
didn't have to?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.156
Ridiculous!

15:57.624 --> 16:01.594
The hunger of Changelings
can never be satisfied.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.532
Exactly. Thorax left the
hive and made a friend.

16:05.565 --> 16:09.269
He shared love and now
he doesn't need to feed!

16:09.302 --> 16:12.005
You don't have to live your
lives starving all the time!

16:13.606 --> 16:15.542
You know nothing
of the Changelings

16:15.575 --> 16:17.277
or what it takes
to be their Queen!

16:19.179 --> 16:24.217
I decide what is best for my
subjects, not some mewling grub!

16:24.251 --> 16:27.554
I know what it's like to lead
by fear and intimidation.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.089
And I know
what it's like

16:29.122 --> 16:31.791
to want everypony
to do what you say.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.528
But I was wrong. A real leader
doesn't force her subjects

16:35.562 --> 16:37.797
to deny who they are.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.367
She celebrates what
makes them unique...

16:40.400 --> 16:43.403
...and listens when one of
them finds a better way.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.473
The only thing
Thorax has found...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.742
...is what happens to those who
turn their back on the hive!

16:49.776 --> 16:51.111
[zap]

16:51.144 --> 16:52.312
No! Stop!

16:53.546 --> 16:57.417
Just as soon as I drain every
last ounce of love from him

16:57.450 --> 17:00.420
and show my subjects
what a real leader is.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.658
I can feel the love
inside me slipping away.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.328
I can't hold onto
it much longer.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.097
Then don't!

17:10.130 --> 17:12.665
Sharing love is what made
you different to begin with.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.102
You should share
yours with Chrysalis.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.337
Give her all of it.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.739
[whoosh]

17:19.772 --> 17:23.110
[zapping]

17:38.291 --> 17:40.760
This is what happens
when you give love freely

17:40.793 --> 17:42.862
instead of taking it.

17:42.895 --> 17:47.834
**

17:50.237 --> 17:53.706
[rumbling and cracking]

17:53.740 --> 17:55.508
[explosion]

17:57.377 --> 18:02.149
* [soft music]

18:02.182 --> 18:05.185
**

18:15.395 --> 18:17.197
Fluttershy?

18:18.898 --> 18:21.468
It's, um, good to see you too.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.471
Starlight?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.774
What happened?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.643
We defeated the Changelings
with no magic at all;

18:30.677 --> 18:32.579
they found a new leader...

18:32.612 --> 18:35.348
and they're all
kinda good now.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.653
Well done, Starlight Glimmer.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.555
It seems as though you've
learned a great deal

18:42.589 --> 18:43.556
since we last spoke.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.458
[cracking]

18:45.492 --> 18:47.594
[shriek]

18:47.627 --> 18:53.900
**

18:53.933 --> 18:55.935
When Twilight and her
friends defeated me,

18:55.968 --> 19:00.207
I chose to run away and seek
revenge. You don't have to.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.475
You can be the leader
your subjects deserve.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.919
There is no revenge you
could ever conceive of

19:12.952 --> 19:15.388
that will come close to
what I will exact upon you

19:15.422 --> 19:18.225
one day, Starlight Glimmer!

19:26.733 --> 19:29.502
Thorax, as the new leader
of the Changelings,

19:29.536 --> 19:32.572
I look forward to discussing how
we can improve our relationship

19:32.605 --> 19:34.574
in the future.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.344
However, for the moment,
perhaps it is best

19:37.377 --> 19:41.481
that we leave the Changeling
Kingdom to the Changelings.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.682
[poof]

19:42.715 --> 19:44.917
Splendid idea!
Now who's ready

19:44.951 --> 19:49.289
for some celebratory
tea at Fluttershy's?

19:49.322 --> 19:52.492
Oh. Um. Everypony?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.961
Actually, now that you
can snap your claws

19:54.994 --> 19:57.297
and send us absolutely
anywhere again,

19:57.330 --> 19:58.831
I think I have a
better option.

20:02.602 --> 20:06.239
Uh.. Hey Starlight.
What are you doing here?

20:06.273 --> 20:08.475
You left in such
a hurry before,

20:08.508 --> 20:11.244
we kinda thought you
didn't want to come.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.747
Yeah. I guess after the way I
used my magic on all of you,

20:14.781 --> 20:17.450
I wasn't sure I was somepony
who should even be in charge

20:17.484 --> 20:20.453
of a baking contest. I was
afraid I might go back

20:20.487 --> 20:23.723
to being the pony I
used to be. But...

20:23.756 --> 20:26.759
...I realized that sometimes
you don't have a choice.

20:26.793 --> 20:31.831
You have to step up. And I
HAVE changed. I can handle it.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.634
Whether than means saving
Equestria OR helping friends

20:34.667 --> 20:38.438
with a sunset festival.
Speaking of which...

20:38.471 --> 20:42.008
...I know the festival is almost
over, but I kinda invited

20:42.041 --> 20:43.910
a few of my
friends to join.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.714
Hope that's OK.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.618
Are you kidding? Of course!

20:51.651 --> 20:54.854
Great. Now, where's
that baking contest?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.789
This pony needs a cupcake!

20:59.859 --> 21:04.764
So I'm able to rip the very
fabric of reality again.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.500
Yeah, yeah and I'm
still a self-absorbed,

21:07.534 --> 21:10.337
below-average
illusionist. Right?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.905
Actually, I was going to say
a COUPLE of those illusions

21:12.939 --> 21:15.575
were slightly above average.

21:15.608 --> 21:19.045
If you ever need a little chaos
in your act, let me know.

21:19.078 --> 21:22.749
Ha! When pigs fly!

21:22.782 --> 21:25.318
Your wish is my command!

21:25.352 --> 21:26.886
[snap]

21:26.919 --> 21:28.321
[squeal]

21:28.355 --> 21:29.789
Whoa-whoaaaa!

21:31.591 --> 21:35.562
Somepony is really gonna have to
catch us up on what we missed.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.600
* My Little Pony

21:42.569 --> 21:44.904
* My Little Pony

21:55.382 --> 21:57.550
* My Little Pony

21:57.584 --> 22:01.588
* friends
