00:07.700 --> 00:14.220
[typing]

00:19.700 --> 00:22.680
Uh...look, I know with what happened…

00:22.680 --> 00:24.420
What happened?

00:25.140 --> 00:28.700
Oh, uh, I mean, you know, the body and…

00:28.700 --> 00:30.760
Oh that? Don’t worry about that.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.320
Wait, what?

00:32.320 --> 00:34.600
Don’t worry about it. Happens to everybody.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.120
Okay, I’m confused.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.120
About?

00:38.120 --> 00:45.261
I mean...I just...I had the NYPD knocking
down my door; raid my apartment and drag me

00:45.261 --> 00:47.730
here!

00:47.730 --> 00:53.120
And I’m pretty sure that they found the
girl that was in my bathtub.

00:53.120 --> 01:00.900
I heard somebody say, “Holy shit, look,
there’s a dead girl in the bathtub!”

01:00.900 --> 01:04.800
And?

01:04.800 --> 01:10.000
And?!?

01:10.000 --> 01:17.870
And nobody has asked me about how the body
got there and nobody has interrogated me-

01:17.870 --> 01:20.240
Do you want to be interrogated?

01:20.240 --> 01:21.420
Well, no, but…

01:21.420 --> 01:24.549
There you go, then.

01:24.549 --> 01:29.940
Okay, so...I’m right back to being confused.

01:29.940 --> 01:37.720
So, I’m not under arrest or, you know, I’m
not going to get taken in for experimentation.

01:37.720 --> 01:41.720
Experimentation? Why would we want to experiment
on you?

01:41.800 --> 01:48.040
Oh...because, I’m...you know, one of the
undead.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.440
Oh. Please don’t call it that.

01:50.440 --> 01:56.660
Well, I thought that was what it was called
when I got the “dark gift” or whatever...

01:56.660 --> 02:00.040
Holy shit! Seriously, don’t say things like
that.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.380
What else am I supposed to call it?

02:02.380 --> 02:06.470
What it is. You’re a fucking vampire! Deal
with it!

02:08.580 --> 02:09.919
Goddamn it, Theresa!

02:09.919 --> 02:12.240
I told you not to do this! Do you remember
that?

02:12.240 --> 02:13.240
I’m sorry!

02:13.240 --> 02:17.900
You’re sorry?!? Sorry’s not good enough!
Sorry?!? Sorry’s not going to cut it because

02:17.900 --> 02:21.260
Cassidy and Susalyn are never going to invite
you back again!

02:21.260 --> 02:27.180
And do you know how long I’ve been trying
to get invited here?!?

02:28.960 --> 02:36.960
I said that I’m sorry, Mika. I just can’t
deal with what her father does! He’s poisoning…

02:38.820 --> 02:40.960
Yeah, it’s all about you. Huh?

02:42.160 --> 02:48.580
You’re fucking unbelievable, do you know
that? You’re unbelievable. Unbelievable.

02:51.340 --> 02:57.680
Just. Don’t talk to me anymore. Don’t.
Okay?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.560
Come on.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.760
Jesus Christ. Really?

03:28.060 --> 03:30.720
Come on. Watch your head.

03:36.340 --> 03:40.200
I’m sorry. Can you just get her to this
address?

03:40.220 --> 03:40.860
Sure.

03:45.580 --> 03:52.880
You owe me $30. Okay? Remember? You owe me
$30.

03:52.880 --> 03:57.580
I don’t know. Venmo me or something when
you get home. Thank you.

05:03.020 --> 05:07.680
Ummm...hello. Mr. Driver person?

05:36.460 --> 05:41.280
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t see you there.

06:09.480 --> 06:19.160
[moaning]

06:21.820 --> 06:25.140
I thought tonight was going to be a shitty
night.

06:46.420 --> 06:49.220
Ow. Ow. That’s a little too hard.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.140
Ow! Ow! That’s too hard! Just stop please!

06:54.240 --> 06:58.860
Stop! Stop! No! Oh god! Please stop!

06:59.060 --> 07:01.460
Get the fuck off of me, please!

07:09.340 --> 07:12.680
The night’s not over yet.

07:12.680 --> 07:19.520
Wow. You really were drunk. I’m feeling
that now.

07:21.740 --> 07:22.880
I was just thinking

07:24.580 --> 07:29.040
That when you don’t show up wherever you
were going to go tomorrow,

07:29.050 --> 07:33.930
They’ll blame the cab driver for it. That’s
how it always works out.

07:33.930 --> 07:40.900
And then every woman in the city will be afraid
to take a town car for a little bit.

07:40.900 --> 07:45.389
Kinda funny when you think about it, huh?

07:45.389 --> 07:54.819
Help me! Please! Somebody help me!

07:54.820 --> 07:56.389
Help!

07:58.160 --> 08:00.240
Shhhhhh...Little Doe.

08:00.240 --> 08:05.640
You mustn’t scream or the Big Bad Wolf will
hear you.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.200
[bone snapping]

08:08.280 --> 08:09.280
Seriously.

08:11.560 --> 08:19.000
It’s almost a shame that someone as pretty
as you is going to be in some fridge tomorrow.

08:19.000 --> 08:28.880
Some cold, impersonal city morgue, with a
little tag on your toe like a Christmas present.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.960
Imagine a little kid opening up a Christmas
present and it’s your corpse inside.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.940
[laughs] That’s so funny!

08:40.679 --> 08:49.240
All warm and wet but tomorrow, it’ll be
dry and cold.

08:49.240 --> 08:57.440
That beautiful soft skin of yours is going
to crack and just rot off.

08:57.440 --> 09:04.190
These. Are just going to sag and wither.

09:04.190 --> 09:12.450
Even this pretty face of yours. Gone.

09:12.450 --> 09:19.529
Oh, Little Doe. You mustn’t cry.

09:19.529 --> 09:22.980
I can tell you’re afraid now.

09:22.980 --> 09:27.920
You don’t want to die, do you?

09:27.920 --> 09:33.230
Nobody does, Little Doe. Nobody does.

09:39.900 --> 09:44.940
Fuck it.

09:49.860 --> 09:53.260
[sounds of tearing flesh]

09:56.520 --> 10:00.560
[heavy breathing]

10:11.740 --> 10:18.720
138! 138! Please report to office two. Now.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.260
That’s me!

10:25.220 --> 10:28.400
Alright then. Orientation time.

10:28.400 --> 10:33.580
First off, I’m sure until the moment you
were made you had no idea we were real, right?

10:33.580 --> 10:34.500
Yeah.

10:34.500 --> 10:39.980
Well, we aim to keep it that way. I’m guessing
since we only found one body at your place,

10:39.990 --> 10:42.300
That means you’ve left bodies in other places,
right?

10:42.300 --> 10:46.060
Yeah. I was just...I couldn’t...chop up...just...

10:46.060 --> 10:52.620
No worries. Just fill out a form. We have
people who handle that sort of thing.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.900
Here.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.320
This goes into the basic do’s and don’t’s.

11:01.330 --> 11:04.649
You know, sunlight, stakes, beheading, fire,
all the things that kill us.

11:04.649 --> 11:06.760
Then there’s the things that are bullshit.

11:06.760 --> 11:12.110
Like not appearing in mirrors, being allergic
to garlic, needing an invitation to enter

11:12.110 --> 11:13.350
someone’s home

11:13.350 --> 11:15.460
Being harmed by holy water and crosses.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.020
It’s really all bullshit, huh?

11:18.020 --> 11:21.920
That it is. Also, there’s some numbers in
there to deal with our particular problems

11:21.930 --> 11:23.410
like…

11:23.410 --> 11:26.260
If you decide you don’t feel like killing
anymore,

11:26.260 --> 11:30.310
we have blood banks set up all around the
city, around most major cities, actually

11:30.310 --> 11:32.620
Where you can get blood from willing donors.

11:32.620 --> 11:36.700
I don’t know. What about feeding on rats
and stuff?

11:37.080 --> 11:38.960
Why would you want to do that?

11:38.960 --> 11:42.170
I mean, that’s what they do in the movies.

11:42.170 --> 11:45.390
Just forget all those stupid movies and tv
show.

11:45.390 --> 11:47.860
We don’t sparkle. We don’t turn into bats.

11:47.860 --> 11:51.060
We can’t fly and we can’t ride fucking
moonbeams or whatever.

11:51.060 --> 11:53.240
You’re a physical creature of flesh and
bone.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.089
Just with a longer lifespan than other creatures
of flesh and bone.

11:56.089 --> 11:58.170
And a very particular diet.

11:58.170 --> 12:03.519
Little stronger, little faster. Can’t sunbathe.
All the rest bullshit. Got it?

12:03.519 --> 12:04.740
Yeah, I got it.

12:04.740 --> 12:08.270
Oh, there’s also something in there about
who to call if you encounter any problems

12:08.270 --> 12:12.900
from werewolves, demons, or other supernatural
beings.

12:12.900 --> 12:20.260
Wait, werewolves and demons? Those things
exist?

12:20.260 --> 12:26.120
Yes, said the vampire to the other vampire.
Supernatural creatures are real.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.900
I know that may come as a shock to you, but
surprise.

12:29.900 --> 12:34.800
In truth, though, there really shouldn’t
be werewolves anymore. It’s completely treatable.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.290
Jesus Christ.

12:36.290 --> 12:40.640
Oh and don’t blog about this. Any of it.
We’re monitoring that. Not even little subtle

12:40.640 --> 12:41.460
hints.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.200
Don’t start randomly quoting “Bela Lugosi’s
Dead” or anything.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.440
Wait, who?

12:46.790 --> 12:49.500
Bless your ignorant little heart.

12:49.510 --> 12:51.670
Don’t worry about it.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.420
Just remember no one knows about us.

12:54.420 --> 12:57.139
I will say it again with extra emphasis.

12:57.140 --> 13:02.690
No one knows about us and if you tell people
about us you will die, ‘kay?

13:03.160 --> 13:04.160
Okay!

13:23.380 --> 13:24.500
Can I help you?

13:24.520 --> 13:25.980
Hi. I’m Allison.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.300
Theresa.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.860
Saw you back at the office there. Was worried
I missed you.

13:31.860 --> 13:34.300
Were you following me?

13:34.300 --> 13:37.380
Yes I was. Your perfume is really easy to
track.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.800
Well, that’s pretty creepy.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.300
We’re hunters. We hunt.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.740
So, you’re new, huh?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.100
That I am.

13:46.100 --> 13:50.060
Well, you just got yourself a guide. So, what
do you got there?

13:50.060 --> 13:56.880
That’s pamphlet Ms. Solenz gave me. It has
all the do’s and don’t’s and stuff.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.300
I mean, have you read this?

13:58.300 --> 14:02.120
I think that it’s supposed to be a little
bit sarcastic, just in case someone who isn’t

14:02.120 --> 14:04.580
one of us finds it.

14:04.580 --> 14:06.700
I guess that makes sense, but

14:06.709 --> 14:15.230
Oh, and this part that says you should learn
hobbies that are difficult to master. What

14:15.230 --> 14:16.899
does that even mean?

14:16.899 --> 14:20.430
I dunno. I’ve had enough time to get really
good at my Mandarin.

14:20.430 --> 14:21.430
Have you?

14:21.430 --> 14:25.320
Mmmhmm. So what do you say, do you know any
other vampires besides the one who made you?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.860
I don’t even know the one who made me.

14:27.860 --> 14:35.320
Poor baby. Tell you what. Why don’t we take
a walk? We’ll talk about it.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.360
Talk?

14:36.460 --> 14:38.400
Maybe some other things.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.440
If I didn’t know any better, Allison, I’d
say you were flirting with me.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.240
And if I was?

14:44.240 --> 14:48.960
Well, the last woman who picked me up ended
up tearing a pretty big chunk of my throat

14:48.970 --> 14:50.079
out by the end of the night,

14:50.079 --> 14:52.350
So thanks but no thanks!

14:52.350 --> 14:55.900
But that turned out better than expected,
now, didn’t it?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.920
Are you hungry?

15:04.840 --> 15:08.260
No, not them. I’m trying to be careful about
this.

15:09.040 --> 15:15.839
Are you sure? He’s AB Negative and she’s
ovulating. Makes everything taste better.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.800
You can tell all that from here?

15:17.800 --> 15:21.920
You can’t? Sorry. You’re new.

15:21.920 --> 15:27.139
Sure I can. Pretty far out, huh? Don’t worry,
you’ll be able to do it soon enough.

15:27.139 --> 15:28.740
They’re not that far from us.

15:28.740 --> 15:32.740
Oh, I’m doing it again, aren’t I? It’s
so hard to keep up with what everyone’s

15:32.740 --> 15:33.800
saying now a days.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.160
If I wasn’t this, I’d be a grandma by
now. How old are you?

15:37.160 --> 15:41.660
You’re going to make me do math? It’s
not one of the powers that we get.

15:41.660 --> 15:44.080
What year? 1972

15:44.580 --> 15:47.220
Okay so that’s 42-

15:47.220 --> 15:52.080
Whatever. It’s boring. Don’t be such a
downer. We’re not supposed to be boring

15:52.080 --> 15:53.020
anymore.

15:53.020 --> 15:57.500
Now come on. Walk with me.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.680
So, you said you saw me back at the office?

16:07.680 --> 16:08.680
Yep.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.690
Do you work there?

16:09.690 --> 16:14.009
God, no silly. Not nearly old enough to work
there. Everyone there is like a thousand years

16:14.009 --> 16:15.400
old or something.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.280
Seriously?

16:16.280 --> 16:17.500
Honest injun.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.860
Wow, that was kinda racist.

16:19.860 --> 16:25.080
Is that racist now? My mother used to use
it all the time. It’s just a word.

16:25.080 --> 16:30.920
Anyway these rules are too boring and they change
far too often for my tastes. I see

16:30.920 --> 16:35.600
So, if you don’t work there, what were you
doing there?

16:35.600 --> 16:40.240
Me and my ex were kinda “bending” the
rules.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.029
I thought they said if you bend the rules,
they kill you.

16:43.029 --> 16:46.840
Bending, not breaking. If I was breaking,
then I wouldn’t be standing here talking

16:46.840 --> 16:48.040
to you right now.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.199
Those guys don’t fuck around with that shit.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.840
So what rule were you “bending?”

16:55.240 --> 16:59.899
You’re new. You got a little weird about
the whole injun thing. So, maybe it’s best

16:59.899 --> 17:01.500
that I not tell you.

17:01.500 --> 17:05.160
You may not think it was as bitchin’ as
we did.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.640
Bitchin’?

17:07.640 --> 17:12.200
Is that not used anymore either? It’s so
hard to talk to new people in my little vampire

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
bubble.

17:13.339 --> 17:14.339
No, it’s cool. It’s okay.

17:14.339 --> 17:19.020
Ah, see you wouldn’t have thought it was
as “cool” as we did.

17:19.020 --> 17:23.020
Alright, well, I get the feeling I shouldn’t
talk about it anymore.

17:23.020 --> 17:26.199
Don’t worry about that any of that boring
bullshit anymore.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.380
We are going to be young forever!

17:28.380 --> 17:31.300
There’s no reason for us to worry about
anything anymore and now you have me as your

17:31.300 --> 17:32.200
guide!

17:32.200 --> 17:37.000
I’m going to show you the ropes! Be the
Mickey to your Rocky! And… fuck…

17:37.000 --> 17:38.860
No, I understood that reference.

17:38.860 --> 17:40.140
Far out.

17:40.140 --> 17:45.100
Anyway, enough about me. It doesn’t seem
like you are enjoying this much.

17:45.100 --> 17:49.080
It’s not that. It’s just...I can barely
wrap my head around…

17:50.260 --> 17:51.620
Okay, here’s the thing.

17:51.620 --> 17:56.760
I took some self-defense courses before I
moved here because I heard all the stories

17:56.770 --> 17:58.130
about New York.

17:58.130 --> 17:59.950
Ah, another transplant, huh?

17:59.950 --> 18:01.309
Yeah, Wooster, MA.

18:01.309 --> 18:04.039
Conchord, New Hampshire! New England, REPRESENT!

18:04.040 --> 18:07.550
So, you picked up fist bumping?

18:08.340 --> 18:10.680
Yeah, boy-ee!

18:10.680 --> 18:16.500
Okay, so as I was saying I took a couple self-defense
courses in my freshman year and

18:16.500 --> 18:21.820
Someone comes at me I can, punch them out,
you know, but otherwise

18:21.820 --> 18:23.440
Wouldn’t hurt a fly, huh?

18:23.440 --> 18:26.280
Oh no, I see a roach that fucker’s dead!

18:27.240 --> 18:34.060
I volunteered in college. I don’t really
like violence. I’m a pacifist.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.320
[laughs]

18:36.320 --> 18:37.620
What’s so funny?

18:37.980 --> 18:40.580
Boy, did you choose the wrong creature to
become!

18:40.590 --> 18:44.929
You should’ve been like a unicorn or a pixie
and then you could prance around the enchanted

18:44.929 --> 18:45.929
forest

18:45.929 --> 18:48.289
As you sprinkle pixie dust on all the little
woodland creatures!

18:48.289 --> 18:54.450
This isn’t funny! In the last month, I’ve
killed five people!

18:54.450 --> 18:58.750
Oh dear! A whole five?!?

18:58.750 --> 19:02.780
You realize you are just like Hitler, right?

19:02.780 --> 19:07.580
This is serious. I don’t know what I’m
doing. I’m way over my head! I feel like

19:07.580 --> 19:08.690
shit about it!

19:08.690 --> 19:13.080
I think I might just try out one of those
blood banks.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.740
I doubt you’re going to want to wait a whole
90 days to feed again.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.210
What do you mean?

19:18.210 --> 19:21.650
Takes 90 days for them to process the application.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.200
Are you fucking serious?

19:23.200 --> 19:27.380
Had a sister who applied for that. Took them
90 days before they let her into the program.

19:29.200 --> 19:33.480
Isn’t it like a blood bank or a soup kitchen
or…

19:33.490 --> 19:37.520
God no. It’s a city program. It’s not
like there’s a bunch of people with their

19:37.520 --> 19:38.800
necks out for you.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.800
Fuck!

19:39.800 --> 19:43.180
It’s part of the cycle, baby. The whole
circle of life.

19:43.180 --> 19:47.880
Listen, I was made back in 1972 but it doesn’t
mean I don’t go for a Brazilian once every

19:47.880 --> 19:48.880
four weeks.

19:50.860 --> 19:53.480
Ummmm….I’m sorry.

19:53.480 --> 20:00.419
By “Brazilian,” you mean a bikini wax,
right. Not that you kill a Brazilian person,

20:00.420 --> 20:01.419
right?

20:02.120 --> 20:03.320
Want to see?

20:03.330 --> 20:05.520
No. Thank you.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.820
And you know, I’m not sure if that analogy
actually works.

20:09.820 --> 20:14.690
You adapt! You adjust to your circumstances.
You were one thing, now you’re something

20:14.690 --> 20:15.750
new.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.520
It’s not that easy!

20:20.010 --> 20:21.980
Don’t think about it.

20:21.980 --> 20:24.130
I can’t help that!

20:24.130 --> 20:27.500
Then I’ll help you.

20:27.500 --> 20:33.360
I have to ask you, if you’re like this,
then why did the person who made you make

20:33.360 --> 20:34.560
you?

20:34.820 --> 20:38.680
I think I got her drunk with my blood.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.980
[flesh sizzling]

21:30.980 --> 21:32.640
[cries out]

21:36.440 --> 21:40.000
What’s burn-

21:40.010 --> 21:42.390
Who are-

21:42.390 --> 21:46.520
Oh, shit.

21:49.860 --> 21:55.840
I made you last night, didn’t I? Fuck.

21:58.160 --> 22:03.360
Well, you don’t want to be touching the
sun now.

22:11.060 --> 22:13.400
Stop it!

22:13.400 --> 22:16.300
Christ, you’re being annoying.

22:16.300 --> 22:21.740
Look, I was really fucking drunk last night
and I didn’t know I was going to have a

22:21.740 --> 22:24.120
guest this morning, so…

22:26.800 --> 22:31.320
You can stay here for the day but I want you
out by the time the sun sets.

22:33.760 --> 22:40.640
No problem. I don’t want to be anywhere
near you, after what you did to me!

22:40.640 --> 22:45.560
Did to you? You mean made you immortal?

22:50.660 --> 22:53.440
You tried to kill me last night!

22:54.620 --> 23:01.060
Whatever. Fine. Bathroom doesn’t get any
sun. Feel free to sleep there if you don’t

23:01.120 --> 23:02.440
want to be near me.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.360
[shower running]

23:23.340 --> 23:27.960
[heart beat]

24:16.680 --> 24:20.200
[stomach rumbling]

24:21.300 --> 24:24.600
Oh, fuck!

24:28.540 --> 24:33.780
[vomiting]

25:25.440 --> 25:38.160
[heart beat]

25:48.100 --> 25:53.080
Wow. That’s pretty fucking far out. I mean…

25:53.080 --> 25:57.360
No, I get it. I know what you mean.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.780
[clears throat]

26:36.620 --> 26:45.380
[laughing] that better

26:52.740 --> 26:59.280
So, not to interrupt, but you did say that
it was five people?

26:59.280 --> 27:00.960
Yeah.

27:00.960 --> 27:08.300
[loud heart beat]

27:22.940 --> 27:26.060
[flesh tearing]

27:54.240 --> 27:57.120
[contented sigh]

28:15.320 --> 28:19.660
No no no no no. Please please. Just wake up,
please!

28:44.200 --> 28:46.120
Alright.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.420
Okay, um, okay.

28:58.660 --> 29:04.600
Drink. Just drink! Please!

29:07.380 --> 29:11.780
[cries]

29:25.020 --> 29:27.340
[electric knife]

29:34.740 --> 29:37.400
I’m so sorry about this.

29:40.540 --> 29:45.420
[electric knife cutting through flesh]

29:46.240 --> 29:50.760
[electric knife getting stuck on bone]

30:09.360 --> 30:13.140
[cries]

30:13.160 --> 30:23.360
No no! Don’t feel bad! It’s what we are.

30:23.360 --> 30:32.640
I didn’t want to do what I did to the jogger.
Never again. It’d been five days.

30:32.640 --> 30:42.440
Five days of me just sitting in my apartment.
Smelling her get just riper and riper and

30:42.440 --> 30:49.080
I didn’t want to go outside because I was
afraid of hurting somebody or attacking somebody.

30:49.080 --> 30:54.860
But I couldn’t stay in there with that smell
anymore.

30:54.860 --> 30:59.660
You know, maybe if I went outside when the
streets were empty and no one was outside,

30:59.660 --> 31:03.660
people would be safe from me.

31:03.820 --> 31:07.740
And then it just happened.

31:08.960 --> 31:16.420
[heart beat]

31:32.760 --> 31:43.580
[heart beat gets louder]

32:17.160 --> 32:22.800
Do it. You said you’d do it! Do it!

32:24.000 --> 32:30.360
[flesh tearing]

32:38.940 --> 32:40.720
Thank you.

32:43.900 --> 32:47.020
Thank you.

32:58.280 --> 33:05.240
It doesn’t have to be violent. I only need
to feed when I feel the hunger coming on.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.260
And that makes it…

33:07.260 --> 33:10.000
Not horrible.

33:11.660 --> 33:15.180
Did you get a job at a suicide hotline?

33:15.180 --> 33:21.680
No, I’ve never met anybody who wanted to
die...that directly but...

33:28.140 --> 33:34.560
[sorrowful music]

34:11.460 --> 34:13.719
Ugh. I hate feeding off of junkies!

34:43.739 --> 34:50.060
[music continues]

36:13.260 --> 36:16.820
I have to be honest.

36:16.820 --> 36:23.260
I was kind of hoping that whatever was in
her system would make me overdose

36:23.260 --> 36:27.620
So that all of this would be over.

36:36.380 --> 36:40.320
It’s good to know where you’ve come from.

36:40.320 --> 36:44.840
I am really glad that you came out tonight.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.140
Me too.

36:47.780 --> 36:53.850
My night was such a downer up until I saw
you.

36:53.850 --> 36:55.520
Tony and I were-

36:55.520 --> 36:59.480
Toni. Is she your ex?

36:59.480 --> 37:03.670
Tony with a “y.” Yeah, he’s my ex.

37:03.670 --> 37:07.830
Wait, uh. I’m sorry. He?

37:07.830 --> 37:11.410
So, you’re normally into guys?

37:11.410 --> 37:13.650
Well, yeah, silly.

37:13.650 --> 37:20.160
But how things are and with us breaking up,
I thought I’d try something new.

37:20.160 --> 37:27.680
Wait. So what am I? Just your vacation from
dick?

37:27.680 --> 37:32.680
Don’t be like that.

37:32.690 --> 37:39.210
I think you’re great, but tonight has been
traumatic enough without being somebody else’s

37:39.210 --> 37:40.440
Katy Perry moment.

37:40.440 --> 37:43.210
Theresa, baby! Don’t be like that.

37:43.210 --> 37:47.810
You know what? Maybe I’ll see you around.

37:47.810 --> 37:54.480
Theresa! Theresa, come on!

38:04.100 --> 38:09.500
[hums]

38:12.500 --> 38:13.960
Alright, listen! I

38:13.970 --> 38:17.710
have had a shitty enough night without some
horny guy trying to get in my pants!

38:17.710 --> 38:21.270
On a normal night, I wouldn’t be into your
equipment and tonight is not a normal night,

38:21.270 --> 38:22.760
so just please

38:22.760 --> 38:25.480
Back off! You have no idea what I could do
to you!

38:25.480 --> 38:29.080
Yeah. That sounds like a challenge to me,
actually.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.839
I’m serious!

38:31.840 --> 38:33.880
Fuck off before I hurt you!

38:33.880 --> 38:35.220
Hurt me?

38:35.220 --> 38:36.820
[laughs]

38:36.820 --> 38:41.040
Wait. Oh my god. You can’t tell?

38:41.040 --> 38:42.300
Tell what?

38:42.300 --> 38:47.440
Seriously? Oh my god. Okay. Alright. Gimme
a minute.

38:54.180 --> 38:56.060
Wait. What?

38:56.060 --> 39:00.400
So, you seriously couldn’t tell? Couldn’t
smell me?

39:00.400 --> 39:03.770
Jesus, what are they teaching kids at the
Hierarchy these days, man?

39:03.770 --> 39:06.890
The Hierarchy didn’t teach you anything?
Allison didn’t teach you anything?

39:06.890 --> 39:09.080
How do you know Alli-

39:09.080 --> 39:11.740
Oh shit, you’re Tony, aren’t you?

39:11.740 --> 39:13.850
Allison talk about me?

39:13.850 --> 39:16.740
Look, whatever you’ve heard about Allison
and I, it’s-

39:16.740 --> 39:17.790
Hey, hey, listen.

39:17.790 --> 39:23.580
If the little lady wants to have herself some
fun of the sapphic variety, I’m totally

39:23.580 --> 39:24.580
cool with that.

39:24.580 --> 39:27.130
Listen, I’m not interested in just being
her fun.

39:27.130 --> 39:33.720
Oh my god, you’re one of those! Bringing
the U-Haul to the first date!

39:33.720 --> 39:35.880
[laughs]

39:35.880 --> 39:38.460
Tell me, what’s your name?

39:38.460 --> 39:39.820
Theresa.

39:39.829 --> 39:44.040
You know, Theresa, I saw you earlier at the
office tonight, when they were yelling at

39:44.040 --> 39:45.880
Allison and I

39:45.880 --> 39:49.770
Well, of course, then we started yelling at
each other.

39:49.770 --> 39:53.119
So, you two literally broke up tonight?

39:53.119 --> 39:55.480
Broke up is a really harsh term.

39:55.480 --> 40:00.480
Besides, my “mom” will get really pissed
off if Allison doesn’t show up to the party

40:00.480 --> 40:01.720
tonight.

40:02.740 --> 40:07.400
Party? What, like a vampire party?

40:07.400 --> 40:12.740
Uh yeah, like a vampire party. You’re telling
me she didn’t invite you?

40:12.740 --> 40:16.880
Wow, that’s really cold, Allison. Geez.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.300
You know what? I’m just gonna go, okay?

40:19.300 --> 40:22.780
No no no no, no no baby girl, don’t go!

40:22.780 --> 40:27.840
Listen, just because Allison and I are taking
a break does not mean that you and I can’t

40:27.840 --> 40:28.890
be close.

40:28.890 --> 40:31.859
I can’t think of a single reason why you
and I can’t be friends.

40:31.859 --> 40:35.310
Oh you can’t think of one? Well, I can think
of several!

40:35.310 --> 40:40.220
First of all, my name is not “Baby Girl,”
it is Theresa. And second-

40:40.220 --> 40:46.880
Second of all, you couldn’t even smell me,
which means you don’t know shit!

40:46.880 --> 40:50.840
Which means you probably need a guide.

40:50.840 --> 40:55.869
Because I’m willing to bet that’s only
one of many problems you’re having.

40:55.869 --> 41:00.930
I bet right now, the world is a whole lot
of white noise.

41:00.930 --> 41:05.420
You’re hearing all sorts of things you couldn’t
hear before.

41:05.420 --> 41:09.700
Rain drops. Insects. Heart beats.

41:09.700 --> 41:14.460
And I bet when someone walks by, it’s like
a whole herd of elephants right next to your

41:14.460 --> 41:14.980
ear.

41:15.820 --> 41:24.220
Been avoiding the subways, been avoiding midtown. Staying out of really populated areas I bet.

41:24.220 --> 41:30.599
And hey, listen, it’s okay. I know it’s
scary. You must be going through hell.

41:30.600 --> 41:36.260
I mean, I had Allison. I had a “mom” to
be there for me.

41:36.260 --> 41:42.540
Maybe what you need is someone to be there
for you.

41:42.540 --> 41:54.660
Tell you what, come with me. I’ll keep my hands
to myself and show you what you can do. Okay?

41:54.680 --> 41:57.700
This doesn’t have to be awful.

41:57.700 --> 42:05.920
This can be really, really wonderful, if you
know how to use your abilities.

42:05.920 --> 42:10.960
So, what do you say? I’ll be good.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.780
Okay.

42:15.780 --> 42:18.940
Just seriously, hand’s off, okay?

42:18.940 --> 42:22.980
Scout’s honor. Now come on.

42:22.980 --> 42:27.400
[hums]

42:31.680 --> 42:35.620
[punk music playing]

42:35.620 --> 42:38.160
No no no! There’s too many people!

42:38.160 --> 42:41.650
That is the whole point! You have to be in
a place with a lot of people!

42:41.650 --> 42:45.240
My head feels like it’s going to explode!
It’s too loud!

42:45.240 --> 42:47.860
Yeah. Close your eyes.

42:49.660 --> 42:51.660
Oh! You lured me here so you could-

42:51.660 --> 42:59.020
I didn’t lure you anywhere. Listen! This
only works if you close your eyes first. I

42:59.020 --> 43:00.640
am trying to help you.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.220
If you try anything-

43:02.220 --> 43:08.360
I’m not going to try anything. So, you can
either do this or I can leave and

43:08.360 --> 43:10.780
you can figure out all this shit on your own.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.460
Fine.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.840
Okay. Close them.

43:18.460 --> 43:22.920
Now, can you hear my voice above everything
else?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.120
Barely.

43:25.120 --> 43:33.620
Alright. What I need you to do is focus and let everything
else fade away. Just listen.

43:34.840 --> 43:45.780
Listen. Listen. Listen.

43:45.780 --> 43:48.560
[background noise fades away]

43:48.560 --> 43:52.820
Now, open your eyes.

43:56.560 --> 44:01.460
This is freaky! It’s this easy?!?

44:01.460 --> 44:05.040
Yes, it is, Baby Girl. I mean, Theresa.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.060
Let me show you something else.

44:07.240 --> 44:09.420
I want you to focus on these people.

44:09.420 --> 44:17.700
Now, Find one. Listen to them. Let yourself smell them, let yourself
hear them, let yourself smell them, let yourself

44:17.700 --> 44:18.700
feel them.

44:19.220 --> 44:24.980
But just focus on one at a time, otherwise,
you’re going to get overwhelmed. ‘kay?

44:27.500 --> 44:31.540
Fucking prick! You’re not supposed to pay
any attention to that. He doesn’t fucking belong

44:31.540 --> 44:32.620
here! Look at him!

44:34.860 --> 44:36.620
Wanna do some shots?

44:39.940 --> 44:42.180
She was supposed to be here two hours ago!

44:43.740 --> 44:48.700
I’m gonna have a couple more drinks! You
have to calm down! I’m fine! I’m fine!

44:50.200 --> 44:55.359
Oh my god! They all sound different! They
all smell different!

44:55.360 --> 45:01.800
Yeah, that’s scent. It’s a combination.
Diet. Blood type. All that sort of shit.

45:01.800 --> 45:06.040
Eventually, you’ll be able to tell blood
type from taste and smell, you know? Something

45:06.040 --> 45:07.040
to learn.

45:07.040 --> 45:10.859
Oh my god, I really can smell everything.
I mean, I’ve been smelling little bits of

45:10.859 --> 45:13.619
pee on all the guys here, but that guy-

45:13.619 --> 45:17.589
Yeah yeah, okay. No no no. Don’t be smelling
that guy.

45:17.589 --> 45:19.910
Why am I smelling little bits of pee on all
the guys here?

45:19.910 --> 45:23.359
That’s not a debate we’re going to have.
I haven’t peed in 42 years so-

45:23.359 --> 45:24.760
No wonder I don’t fuck you guys.

45:24.760 --> 45:28.400
If I really wanted to, I can point out some
of the women here who aren’t smelling too

45:28.400 --> 45:29.380
fresh this morning-

45:29.380 --> 45:32.660
Oh come on! Can we talk about something else? Okay yeah

45:32.670 --> 45:37.460
That sounds like a wonderful idea! Music!
Music! You’re not hearing the music right

45:37.460 --> 45:41.540
now, so
Let’s focus on the most primal form. Drums.

45:41.540 --> 45:50.840
Vocals. Drum beat is like a heart. Find it. Okay.

45:50.940 --> 46:00.220
Now, let the other instruments fade in. Listen
to the voice and just put it together like

46:00.220 --> 46:04.540
a skeleton. Parts become one beautiful whole

46:04.540 --> 46:10.360
[music fades in]

46:17.920 --> 46:24.500
Feels like I have super powers. Can I read
minds too?

46:24.500 --> 46:27.360
No, you can’t read minds.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.140
Sucks.

46:28.140 --> 46:34.320
but now, that I’ve been kind enough to show
you how to use your senses, do you smell what

46:34.320 --> 46:35.320
I smell?

46:36.720 --> 46:39.440
I dunno. What? What do you smell?

46:41.180 --> 46:45.740
Let’s think outside the box a little. Come
on. Tell me what you see besides these

46:45.740 --> 46:46.500
people.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.440
I smell a lot of people outside the club.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.300
Uh huh?

46:54.860 --> 46:59.540
And someone outside in the alley behind the
bar.

46:59.540 --> 47:04.109
She’s alone and she’s drunk as a skunk
from how her blood smells, so go let’s get

47:04.109 --> 47:05.180
you a drink!

47:05.180 --> 47:10.760
Sorry. I’m not thirsty. I have a few days
before I have to drink. And if I drink from

47:10.760 --> 47:12.160
her, I’m going to get drunk-

47:12.160 --> 47:18.599
Listen, grasshopper! The lesson is not yet over! Are you saying you don’t trust me?

47:18.599 --> 47:20.839
No, I’m not saying that.

47:20.840 --> 47:24.720
Okay, good! Because I was nice enough to go
and help you here! Okay?!?

47:24.720 --> 47:26.420
Yeah, you were. You were.

47:26.420 --> 47:30.600
Good, so come on. Let’s go. It’ll be fun!

47:31.580 --> 47:34.600
[throwing up]

47:37.460 --> 47:38.520
Fuck!

47:39.680 --> 47:47.000
Fucking asshole! How could he do this to me?!?
Fuck!!

47:48.500 --> 47:51.540
Ma’am? Are you okay?

47:51.559 --> 47:57.839
No no no no. I’m not fucking okay. Fucking
asshole. He took my fucking-

47:57.840 --> 48:02.180
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You’re like, really, fast.

48:02.180 --> 48:07.160
That I am, but don’t worry, you’re safe
with my friend and I.

48:07.940 --> 48:12.860
Check it out, Theresa, it’s another redhead.
Something you and I have in common.

48:12.860 --> 48:15.660
What, you couldn’t tell she was a redhead
by scent?

48:15.660 --> 48:19.380
No, Theresa, you can’t tell hair color by
scent. That’d be stupid.

48:19.380 --> 48:21.360
What are you guys even talking about?

48:21.369 --> 48:24.210
Don’t you worry your pretty little head
about it.

48:24.210 --> 48:29.250
Listen, your knight in shining armor is here
and I’m going to help you. So, listen, first

48:29.250 --> 48:30.250
thing I need to know

48:30.250 --> 48:32.760
This guy, what was his name?

48:32.760 --> 48:37.000
Jimmy. Jimmy fucking Cesare! He took my fucking
purse and then he hit me!

48:37.000 --> 48:41.460
Who hits a fucking girl?!? Who fucking does
that?!? Who does that?!?

48:41.460 --> 48:43.390
Obviously, someone with a lot of issues.

48:43.390 --> 48:50.080
Yeah yeah yeah. Whatever. Where the fuck are
my keys? Were they in my purse or-

48:50.660 --> 48:53.660
Whoa whoa whoa! Tony, what are you doing?

48:53.660 --> 48:58.000
Hey! Listen! Listen! I was just trying to
help! I was just-

48:58.000 --> 49:01.780
He’s being a douche is what you were being!
Tony, what are we doing? Is there a reason

49:01.780 --> 49:03.000
why we’re here?!?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.100
Of course there is.

49:04.100 --> 49:05.680
Hands off me!

49:06.440 --> 49:08.620
Check this out, Theresa!

49:10.600 --> 49:14.180
Tony! Tony, please stop!

49:19.300 --> 49:23.360
Tony, what the fuck?!? She’s still alive!

49:23.360 --> 49:25.100
Yes, she is!

49:28.880 --> 49:34.880
Please please please, please! Tony!

49:37.840 --> 49:38.840
Here!

49:42.620 --> 49:45.600
[laughs and hoots]

49:45.600 --> 49:49.280
What the hell was that Tony? Why didn’t you finish
her?

49:49.280 --> 49:56.360
Can you smell that? Can you smell the fear
in her blood? Gives her blood a little extra

49:56.360 --> 49:57.599
flavor, don’t it?

49:58.460 --> 50:00.540
You’re so fucking fucked up!

50:00.540 --> 50:05.760
No, listen, there’s a lesson here. Okay...okay…

50:05.760 --> 50:10.260
What I need you to do is let her go and then
I’ll show you how to track her using her

50:10.260 --> 50:13.180
fear. It’s a really useful skill to have.

50:15.880 --> 50:20.500
Oh yeah, I like to wear this, so you don’t
look like you just murdered someone in an

50:20.540 --> 50:21.300
alley.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.780
I don’t want to die.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.260
It’s okay. It’s okay.

50:26.260 --> 50:32.440
What is going on? Why aren’t you chasing
her? The whole point of me bringing you out

50:32.440 --> 50:34.740
here was so I could teach you how to do this, okay?

50:34.740 --> 50:39.000
Shut the fuck up, Tony! I’m so sorry about
this...

50:39.000 --> 50:40.680
Son of a fucking bitch!

50:41.660 --> 50:48.530
Just close your eyes and think of somewhere
nice. Somewhere you love. Somewhere beautiful.

50:48.530 --> 50:51.180
And I get to tend the rabbits! [makes shotgun
noise]

50:51.180 --> 50:53.740
Stop, Tony, come on!

50:53.740 --> 50:58.620
I don’t know. Maybe you’re not smart.
Maybe you’re not brilliant. Allison doesn’t

50:58.620 --> 51:01.440
really go for brains.

51:01.440 --> 51:07.720
But the red shit coming out of her neck means
she is dying, okay? It doesn’t matter if

51:07.720 --> 51:08.720
you want to be

51:08.720 --> 51:13.640
Mother fucking Theresa and let her go, she
is going to die in this fucking alley, so

51:13.640 --> 51:19.080
you should do what I tell you! I don't want to die.

51:19.080 --> 51:25.580
Close your eyes! Close your eyes because you’re
going somewhere peaceful alright?

51:25.580 --> 51:29.710
Yeah, the Kings County Morgue is really fucking
peaceful this time of night!

51:29.710 --> 51:32.180
So, stop being so fucking dramatic!

51:35.980 --> 51:39.060
My fucking god! Waste of a goddamn fucking
evening!

51:39.660 --> 51:42.820
[whimpers]

51:52.200 --> 51:53.960
Shhhhh. It’s okay.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.560
[flesh tearing]

51:59.560 --> 52:02.180
Well, it’s about fucking time. Jesus.

52:11.780 --> 52:16.640
I can’t believe you made me do that. She
was so scared. I know what it’s like to

52:16.650 --> 52:17.650
feel like that.

52:17.650 --> 52:22.480
Whatever, Gandhi. Listen, instead of complaining,
maybe you should be saying thank you.

52:22.480 --> 52:26.390
Because now you don’t have to sit in your
cave and wait for the people to go away.

52:26.390 --> 52:35.150
No! That was awful! That wasn’t me. I don’t
want them to feel terror like that.

52:35.150 --> 52:38.620
You know, there’s a lot of good blood going
to waste. You should probably do something

52:38.620 --> 52:39.360
about that.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.360
Yeah, I’ll hold.

52:42.860 --> 52:49.400
Fuck you! Fuck you! Seriously! Fuck you, you
fucking psycho!

52:50.680 --> 52:56.440
Hi. V-Code: 483-367

52:56.440 --> 53:07.080
Yeah, uh, I’m in an alleyway off Troutman,
between Irving and Wyckoff. Victim was arguing

53:07.089 --> 53:08.210
with someone named

53:08.210 --> 53:16.520
Jimmy Cesare. Yeah yeah. She was going on
about how her purse was stolen. Yeah, final

53:16.520 --> 53:17.730
kill was done by me

53:17.730 --> 53:21.040
and...What’s your V-Code?

53:27.680 --> 53:30.960
Theresa somebody or other. She just ran off.

53:30.960 --> 53:40.480
Okay...Oh, okay. Thanks a lot. Yeah, cool.
You have a good evening too. Thank you.

53:42.520 --> 53:46.160
Well…

53:46.160 --> 53:48.040
Waste not, want not.

53:52.880 --> 53:57.860
[sounds of feeding]

54:02.680 --> 54:10.780
Can I ask you why the government hasn’t
tried to hunt us down or experiment on us?

54:10.780 --> 54:14.390
Well, they recognize that we’re predators
and predators have to hunt.

54:14.390 --> 54:18.470
As long as you’re registered and don’t
step on the wrong toes and don’t let the

54:18.470 --> 54:19.610
general public know we’re around

54:19.610 --> 54:21.750
They’re perfectly okay with us hunting.

54:21.750 --> 54:25.150
Sorry, but why are they okay with that?

54:25.150 --> 54:27.550
Because there are rules; acceptable losses.

54:27.550 --> 54:31.730
Keep your kills private. Don’t feed on anyone
you’ve been seen with. Don’t feed on anyone

54:31.730 --> 54:32.780
you know.

54:32.780 --> 54:37.620
Don’t turn anyone who will have a big mouth
about it. Don’t feed on anyone who will

54:37.620 --> 54:39.220
be missed. Don’t feed on children-

54:39.220 --> 54:48.360
Whoa. Children? People will-we...we feed on
little children?

54:48.360 --> 54:52.840
Let me tell you from personal experience,
children are delicious. It’s like heaven

54:52.840 --> 54:54.000
in your mouth.

54:54.980 --> 54:56.100
Really?

54:56.100 --> 54:59.480
Oh my god, yeah! Especially babies.

54:59.480 --> 55:08.359
So, you have fed on babies? Why aren’t you
in trouble?

55:08.359 --> 55:14.560
One of us was lucky enough to be born in a
time of plague and abundant orphans.

55:14.560 --> 55:19.990
The other was born in a time of Amber Alerts
and Nancy Grace, so stay away from kids.

55:19.990 --> 55:21.780
Not thinking that’s going to be a problem.

55:21.780 --> 55:28.460
Good. Because if it becomes a problem, we’ll
kill you. Without question, without mercy,

55:28.470 --> 55:29.609
we will kill you.

55:29.609 --> 55:34.710
And if you think you’re going to get away
with fucking with the rules, you will have

55:34.710 --> 55:36.500
another thing coming.

55:38.980 --> 55:41.480
Theresa! Excuse me. Theresa!

55:41.480 --> 55:47.700
What? No scent. You’re another vampire,
aren’t you?

55:47.700 --> 55:54.380
Guilty as charged. I’m terribly sorry to
disturb you. My name is Polina. Polina Volkova.

55:54.380 --> 55:58.780
Well, that’s great. That’s just fucking
great. It’s just going to be an insane vampire

55:58.780 --> 56:02.380
parade. That’s my life now. I don't need to deal-

56:04.740 --> 56:07.780
Wait. Holy shit. You’re their mother, aren’t
you?

56:07.790 --> 56:09.150
Excuse me.

56:09.150 --> 56:11.540
Tony and Allison. You’re their mother, aren’t
you?

56:11.540 --> 56:18.660
No. Dear me, no. Far from it, in fact. I represent
someone of great stature who would like to

56:18.660 --> 56:20.240
speak to you.

56:21.900 --> 56:24.700
I’m sorry. I don’t want to deal with this.
I just want to go home.

56:24.700 --> 56:26.220
[bone crunching]

56:26.220 --> 56:30.830
Ms. Costanza. It will only take a moment.
We just want to talk.

56:32.580 --> 56:35.020
Wait...I didn’t tell you my name.

56:35.020 --> 56:37.580
All will be explained when you meet Her.

56:55.420 --> 56:56.800
[car door slamming]

56:57.120 --> 57:05.940
I would offer you a drink but I can tell you
have just fed.

57:12.900 --> 57:16.560
Oh, my sweet child

57:18.880 --> 57:22.760
Do not be embarrassed by what you are.

57:24.220 --> 57:26.320
I’ve been hearing that all night.

57:26.320 --> 57:36.400
Yes! But you have heard it from those who should
be. Those who do not appreciate the gift they

57:36.400 --> 57:37.400
have.

57:37.400 --> 57:47.190
You ran into two of that Russian barbarian’s
offspring. She, like her children, do not

57:47.190 --> 57:48.720
know of beauty.

57:49.660 --> 57:55.520
They do not know of the grace in what we do.

57:55.520 --> 57:56.760
But you do?

57:56.760 --> 58:06.140
Ah, the things I could show you, Theresa Costanza.
The things I could show you.

58:06.140 --> 58:07.700
What about her?

58:09.780 --> 58:16.700
I serve a greater purpose. Before I met the
Order, I was lost, but now I’m where I was

58:16.700 --> 58:18.359
always supposed to be

58:18.359 --> 58:22.369
My blood will feed La Reina and that’s all
I need.

58:22.369 --> 58:29.500
If I can help her live one more day, even
with my death, I have lived a good life.

58:29.500 --> 58:37.400
You see, Ms. Costanza? There are those
who will give themselves to us willingly.

58:37.400 --> 58:43.240
We are not all animals like that Allison and
Tony you met earlier tonight.

58:43.240 --> 58:51.060
He, especially...leave it to that graceful
woman to allow one like him to become one

58:51.060 --> 58:52.460
of them.

58:53.340 --> 59:03.260
A man like him in Order would have been sport
come Festival de Malandro

59:03.260 --> 59:08.620
A man like him would never taint my blood.

59:08.620 --> 59:16.240
Ms. Costanza, you should participate in the
Festival sometime. It really is quite glorious.

59:16.240 --> 59:25.640
The predator becomes prey. We, those who love
La Reina, become something more than ourselves.

59:25.640 --> 59:32.080
Something...Something more like her. Something
divine.

59:32.080 --> 59:37.460
Also, it is quite the chance to let loose,
shall we see.

59:37.460 --> 59:39.040
[laughs]

59:39.040 --> 59:44.520
What do you want from me and why do you both
know my name?

59:44.520 --> 59:49.160
Theresa Costanza, I know many things.

59:49.160 --> 59:52.820
La Reina was gifted with the second sight
even before she ascended.

59:52.820 --> 01:00:00.220
My Order would embrace you. There would be
no more struggle to feed.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.820
That would be nice.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.140
That wouldn’t just be nice, it would be
an honor, Ms. Constanza!

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:11.280
You are meeting with the high priestess of
our order! Do you know how few receive an

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.300
audience-

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.380
She will learn, Polina! She will learn!

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.560
What do you want?!?

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:27.080
Information. It is, as they say, power.

01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:36.731
I have an enemy and that enemy made the two
you met tonight. Them and many more.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.140
Many more who do not know of grace.

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:49.660
My enemy, the Russian, she feels she has the
right to get into my territory.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:59.040
But I am told I cannot move against her unless
I want to start a war. No one wants a war.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:09.600
The Hierarchy wants us all to play nice. There
is where I need you to become my eyes. Those

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.580
two they will-

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:16.720
I just want to go home. I think I just want to go home. I’m sorry.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:28.040
Theresa Costanza, are you giving up the chance
to be under my protection?

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.240
Giving up the chance to be a sister in my
Order?

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.600
I just want to go home.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:54.180
Get out of my sight.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:02:01.780
If you mention that you met me to Sakkara
or any of her children, they will kill you.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:10.120
And if they don’t, I will! Then I will kill
everything that you’ve ever loved!

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:16.680
My name is never to be on your lips. Go!

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.100
[car door slams]

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.540
[door slams]

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:10.640
[flies buzzing]

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.720
[silence]

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.560
[knocking on door]

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.740
Alright. Alright! Okay, Alright, Jesus!

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:35.360
Hi. What
are you doing here? Are you tracking me again?

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.020
Christ I just got done dealing with your crazy ex-boyfriend.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.460
You met Tony?

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:49.260
Yeah! Listen, I don’t want to be part of
your weird relationship drama.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:54.420
Okay, sorry. I didn’t know he was going
to get involved with you. He didn’t hurt

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.320
you, did he?

01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:02.600
No. He’s just fucking sleazy. How could
you go out with a guy like that?

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.740
He can be kind’ve sweet when you get to
know him.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:12.600
Whatever. It’s really late. I’m just going
to turn in.

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:16.220
No no no no no. The sun doesn’t come up
for another six hours!

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.220
Really, I’m done for the night!

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.440
Theresa, I really really like you!

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:29.000
I’m sorry that we got off on the wrong foot
and definitely sorry you had to deal with

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Tony.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.180
Can I come in?

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:38.260
I thought vampires didn’t need permission
to enter someone’s else’s house.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.540
We don’t. It’s just good manners to ask.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.400
Alright. Fine. Come in.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.020
Yay. Thank you!

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:58.840
Hey, I like you. A lot. You’ve got a certain
vibe about you, you know?

01:04:58.849 --> 01:05:06.099
I really like you too, Allison. I’m worried
about just being your vacation from him.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:10.280
I just met you. I can’t commit to someone
so soon.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.260
No, that’s not what I’m trying to say.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:18.000
Baby, let's just take things as they come. Okay?

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.720
Oh, this feels so wrong.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.460
There’s no wrong for us anymore.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.780
I don’t want to live like that.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.760
So, there’s a party tonight.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.480
I know, Tony told me about it.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.040
Why don’t you come? Meet some more of your
kind?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.920
Yeah, if they’re anything like Tony…

01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:02.300
Some of them are, but do remember that sister
I told you about, the one who does the blood

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.300
donations?

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.780
Miranda always shows up to these things and
she never seems to have any fun.

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.920
Maybe the two of you will have something in
common.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.820
Are you trying to pawn me off on someone else?

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:20.940
No, baby, I want you all to myself. I just
think maybe you could use a few more friends.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.340
Alright. Um...so where is this party?

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.600
Westchester.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.380
Westchester?

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:34.500
There’s no way we will be able to get there
and back without the sun-

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:41.460
It’s all taken care of. And it’s a nice
place, with servants and everything.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:47.720
And it’s safe there. It’s all family.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.240
And you’re sure it’s okay if I come?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.080
Mmmhmm.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:57.940
Sorry to ask but is Tony going to be there?

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.620
You won’t have to interact with him at all.
I promise.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.400
You promise?

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.440
I do.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:15.860
Okay. Alright. Fine. Can I go change into
something a little bit nicer?

01:07:15.869 --> 01:07:16.990
You need any help?

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.940
Not if you want to actually make it to that
party.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.540
So, what do you think?

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:54.320
It’s weird. I didn’t realize how little
I’d be picking up when I was around all

01:07:54.329 --> 01:07:57.770
these other...well, you know…

01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:59.860
You can say vampires.

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.630
Vampires. It’s like I’m not picking up
any scents or anything.

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:06.940
You’ll get to that in time.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:13.440
I guess. It’s a pretty mixed party. I wasn’t
expecting this.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440
Why?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.029
I dunno. Seems weird, is all.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.279
Aw. Fuck.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:21.840
Hey, Baby Girl!

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.200
Hey Tony.

01:08:23.219 --> 01:08:24.689
And Indira Gandhi.

01:08:24.689 --> 01:08:25.689
Whatever.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:30.880
This is my ex and her beard. She’s decided
she’s a lesbian since we broke up.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.020
Ladies, this is Aurora. She’s going to live
forever.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.100
Aurora Nightshade.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.640
Obviously.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.160
Tony is going to usher me under the long,
black veil.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.779
He’s going to initiate me into the world
of the Brujah.

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:49.390
And together, we will rage against the societal
norms that Ventrue like yourself cling to.

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:50.600
The Bru-wha?

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.710
Do not mock our clan. I was born into darkness.
Conceived under the Only Theatre of Pain.

01:08:55.710 --> 01:09:00.529
Not the Valor stuff. Never the Valor stuff.
He is untrue.

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:03.779
Do you have any idea what she’s talking
about?

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:07.540
Come along, Aurora. Let’s let the ladies
wallow in their conformity.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.240
What the fuck just happened?

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.640
I think that Tony stopped at Hot Topic on
the way to the party.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.738
Is that some stupid attempt to make you jealous.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:19.310
I don’t know how it could be.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.080
Oh hey, Theresa, this is the sister I was
telling you about.

01:09:26.089 --> 01:09:27.089
Hi Miranda.

01:09:27.089 --> 01:09:28.720
Hi Allison.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.158
There’s someone that I want you to meet.

01:09:30.158 --> 01:09:31.929
Thanks, but I have a lot of-

01:09:31.929 --> 01:09:34.319
This is Theresa. She’s new.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:37.779
Huzzah for her. Now, if you don’t mind,
I have some inventory-

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:40.719
No no no. I wanted her to talk to you. You
guys are kind’ve alike.

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.630
I’m sure we’re practically twinsies, but-

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:45.760
She’s weird about the whole feeding thing.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.920
Oh. Hello Theresa.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.920
Hey.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.000
So you just got turned.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yeah.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
How long ago?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
About a month.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So you are new.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.360
So I’m just going to let you guys talk.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.240
Allison, you said-

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.600
So…

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.760
Some party, huh?

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.980
I guess.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.460
Where did you meet Allison?

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:23.360
She actually followed me home from the orientation
I had to go to.

01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:25.390
Oh, you mean the Hierarchy offices?

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:28.170
Yeah, she and Tony were being bad.

01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:30.240
What did they do exactly?

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.080
She didn’t tell you.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.240
I didn’t get specifics but if Tony was involved,
I'm assuming it can’t be good.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.320
Tony isn’t even the worst one here. I take
it you haven’t met Paisley yet.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.940
You mean like the garnish?

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:52.480
No, that’s parsley. It’s Paisley, like
the design or like the town in Scotland.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.300
There’s a town in Scotland named Paisley.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:11:00.100
Apparently so. But once you meet her, you’ll
give serious thought to tanning.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.460
Wow. She’s really that bad, is she?

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:08.540
You’ll see. Or hopefully, she’ll get in
a car accident on the way here and you won’t.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.480
I guess.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.300
So, about the program?

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:19.739
Yeah. Everything comes clean and packaged.
It took me about 90 days to apply.

01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:23.480
Yeah. Allison told me it the 90 days thing

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.640
I had to deal with doing some things I’d
rather not talk about right now until then.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.140
I understand.

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:31.540
Do you?

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.740
I’ve fed on five people since I’ve been
turned and it’s just…

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.700
Really not my thing.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.440
Well, I’ll hook you up with the app for
your phone.

01:11:43.449 --> 01:11:47.660
It automatically applies you and then reapplies
you when the year’s up.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:52.680
You have to apply every year to prove that
you’re not abusing the program in any way.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.300
I see.

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.940
Uh, Can I ask you a question?

01:11:58.940 --> 01:11:59.840
No.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.100
Oh, okay.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:09.180
I was kidding. You asked me a question asking
if you could...nevermind. What is it?

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:15.290
Well, for my orientation, they mentioned something
about other beings.

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:21.400
Werewolves and demons and I don’t know.
Did you ever met any of them?

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.200
No really. Just other vampires. But hey, until
I met our “mother” I hadn’t met any

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.840
of our kind either.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.280
I am not sure why you mean by “our.”

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:31.980
Mother.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.460
And who is this child?

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.820
I do not smell any of my blood within her.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.280
I’m Theresa.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.780
Child, come with me. We must talk.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.860
So, you seek to come between my children?

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.140
Whoa. Whoa. Wait, I-

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:09.780
My Tony and my Allison. I found them together
at Galaxy 21 and thought they should be together

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780
forever,

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.460
so I made it so.

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:14.640
Are you trying to tell me that you know better
than I,

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.440
who was born before your grandmother’s grandmother’s
grandmother?

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.500
No no no. That’s not at all what I’m trying-

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:26.700
Do you know of poetry? Do you know of love?
Love between predators?

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.500
I know what it’s like to be in love. I…

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:33.800
You know the love of a little girl. The love
of a school child who feels her heart thump

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.430
for the first time.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:43.000
I speak of love passed through blood. Passed
through time. Birth is painful. Always. Always,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.180
is it painful.

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:50.140
Yet, I do not smell any of me within you.
I cannot tell whose child you are, but you

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.460
are not one of mine.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.631
Listen to me for just a minute!

01:13:53.631 --> 01:13:57.260
A minute she asks for. What is that to a god?

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:03.940
Do you ask a second of the wind? To fire?
To earth? To water?

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:09.540
Do you know what these eyes have seen? Know
she will never be yours!

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.270
Just, please, lady.

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:15.540
You may call me by my name: Sakkara!

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.800
Okay, alright...Sakkara…

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.370
Did you give Tony the same lecture for his
wanna-be Morticia?

01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:32.800
Oh, you are an innocent, yes? Oh, I see.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:40.870
Much you do not know of this world. Much you
have yet to learn, yes?

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:43.180
I don’t get it.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:50.700
Go. Go, pleasure my daughter. Perhaps you
learn a little of what you are tonight, yes?

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:55.220
Uh...thank you for your blessing.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:00.900
[laughs]

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.140
I don’t think your “mom” liked me very
much.

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:22.960
She doesn’t have to. It only matters that
I like you.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:31.760
[moaning]

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.640
This has all been like some crazy fucking
dream, you know?

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.080
I hope you’re not planning on waking up
anytime soon.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.500
No. It’s just…

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:32.620
Some things have been terrifying but

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:38.480
Some other things have just been beautiful.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:45.260
That’s what our life is. We can do whatever
we want to. And we have all the time in the

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.640
world to do it.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.960
All we have to do to get it is…

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.200
Is that really so bad?

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.000
Yeah, it is for me.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.360
Well, Miranda will help you with that if it
really bothers you so much.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:07.880
It’s just nature, you know? I mean, do you
blame a lion when it kills a lamb?

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.180
Yeah, but we’re not lions.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:16.040
But we’re also not...people. Not really,
not anymore.

01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:22.530
I know you still feel like one. You still
look like one. But we’re different from

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:24.560
them now.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:32.460
I have a lot of trouble believing that.

01:17:32.469 --> 01:17:40.680
People get sick. People grow old. People smell
and pee and poo and they rot away.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:47.120
But we are going to be beautiful, forever.
Forever, Theresa.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.920
If I wasn’t made this, what would I be now?

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.580
Some New England grandma, sitting in a nursing
home, unloved?

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:10.980
Old, ugly. My nurses being mean to me when
my diaper needed to be changed.

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:14.670
Probably looking back in regret at taking
that bus to New York, thinking I was going

01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:16.030
to be Linda Lovelace,

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:19.890
and that Tony was going to make me a star?

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:26.080
That’s where I’d be right now. Forgotten. Probably
even dead by now. I was doing a lot of blow

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.080
back then.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:38.180
But look at me now, 40-something years later,
and I’m still young and beautiful.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.200
People still turn their heads when I walk
down the street. Hell, you want me, don’t

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:42.700
you?

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.140
You know I do.

01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:51.281
But would you if I were an old woman? I don’t
mean to get too much of a head trip on you,

01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:52.281
you know,

01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:57.460
but would you really want me if I were just
old, broken down Allison Crandel from Concord?

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:03.900
It’s just the cycle of life. Some things
have to die so that other things can live.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:04.420
That's...

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:08.240
Plants feel pain. You know that, right?

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:14.160
So, even the gentle animals out there in the
fields eating grass and leaves and shit

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:21.540
They’re still feeding on something alive
to live. You can’t get around it. No matter

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.320
how hard you try.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:43.260
And we can go wherever we want to. Just the
two of us. Go ahead. Name a place for me.

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:49.160
Name someplace you’ve never been before.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.940
I’ve never been to Spain.

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:56.800
Then we’ll go to Spain. Barcelona.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:08.820
And then maybe Paris or Berlin or Tokyo or
wherever. We can go wherever we want to.

01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:16.260
And there are arms wide open for us,
wherever we decide to go. There’s so much beauty in the

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.820
world for us.

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:22.320
The world was made for us. We’re the only
ones around long enough to see everything.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.800
Except the day time.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.100
Well, after we’ve seen everything
there is to see. And we’re all riding around

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.680
on flying cars

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.860
and all the cities are in domes and we’ve
been to Mars,

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:42.060
we can go and watch the sunrise together and
the last thing we see is going to be something

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.220
beautiful.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.700
You make it all sound so...clean.

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:57.770
It’s a small price to pay. Eventually, you
don’t even feel guilty about it. Trust me

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:58.820
on that.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.780
I think I’m gonna go take a shower.

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.540
I know, I laid some heavy shit on you today.

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:15.640
But at some point you’re going to have to accept
what you are.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.920
Or you’re going to just have to decide maybe
it’s time to say hi to the big yellow bitch

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.840
in the sky.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.180
Are those the only two ways this goes?

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:40.380
Think I’m going to stay in here for a bit.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:49.220
I’m gonna go take a shower. Alright.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.040
[party music]

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.200
What are you typing?

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.000
Inventory. I run a vintage clothing store
off Avenue A.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.620
Kinda appropriate.

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:38.560
Would be if I were made in the 1850’s. I
was born in 1982 and turned in 2010.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:44.400
I’m the second youngest in this little...well,
I guess if you want to call it a “family.”

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.240
Only one younger is Paisley.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.940
So, why do you run a vintage clothing store?

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:55.940
Because money is required to exchange goods
and services.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:01.280
Just because I drink blood doesn’t free
me from the joys of Capitalism.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:09.360
So, you know...I noticed that only half the
people here are vampires.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.590
We are the real 1%.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.200
But nobody here seems to be quiet about it.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.480
I mean, Tony over there just told that girl
that he was going to make her one of us.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.000
Oh. You really don’t get it, do you?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.680
Get what?

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.000
You didn’t notice all the security getting
in here? The giant fence around the property?

01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:32.010
The dogs?

01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:35.750
Yeah, I thought...Allison told me this was
a safe place.

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:41.320
For us, it is. Almost everybody who isn’t
one of us isn’t getting out of here alive.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:53.360
I mean, come on, you’ve met Solenz. Can
you imagine if Tony brought that girl into

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.360
the Hierarchy Offices?

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.070
She’d stake him on the spot.

01:23:56.070 --> 01:24:01.110
I think I feel ill. I can’t believe...I
feel like such a bitch for making fun of that

01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:02.469
poor girl!

01:24:02.469 --> 01:24:04.340
We need to get them out of here! We need to
tell somebody!

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.949
Your heart is in the right place and I’ve
been where you are,

01:24:06.949 --> 01:24:11.760
but you’re just going to cause a panic and
get them all killed sooner. Trust me.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.780
What about the lake?!?

01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:16.260
You didn’t swim all the way out to the other
side. Lined with barbed wire and there’s

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.460
guards on the shore.

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:24.740
This is so fucked up.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:27.330
Wait, then what are you still doing here?

01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:29.909
Sakkara’s still the one who made me.

01:24:29.909 --> 01:24:33.580
Even if I don’t like what’s going on,
I still come, just to keep the peace.

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.790
That is fucked up and you know it!

01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:41.310
I don’t disagree. But do you think you or
I, or even us both, could fight our way through

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:42.310
here?

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:43.310
What about the butlers-

01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:44.310
Slaves.

01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:50.220
Occasionally, Sakkara will pick out a few
that she likes and give them the option of

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:53.160
serving for life or dying here.

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:58.560
I take it you haven’t seen the basement.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.720
No. What’s in the basement?

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:07.180
Well, besides the fucking oven she uses to
burn all the bodies from her little parties…

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.480
[car crash outside]

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.380
There goes avoiding a panic. I’m sorry to
do this to you, but I’m allergic to Paisley.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:26.040
Alright, bitches! I brought tonight’s entertainment!

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.080
Oh, for fuck’s sake. Is that who I think
it is?

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:34.460
Everybody, I want you to meet...uh...whatever.

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:39.440
Her name isn’t important. All that matters
is that she’s mine now.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.630
She was rude to me and now she has to be punished.

01:25:42.630 --> 01:25:46.740
Jesus fuck, Paisley! You actually went and
got the goddamn salesgirl?

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:50.860
Yes, I did. You don’t talk to me like that.

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:55.239
This isn’t one of your fucking rich daddy’s
lawsuits! You have to be more careful with

01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:56.920
this sort of thing!

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.150
About a month ago, Paisley was bitching that
she went to buy some shoes and

01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:02.290
the salesgirl who worked there was rude to
her.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:07.740
Yup. And tonight, she’s going to learn that
the customer is always right. Isn’t that

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.300
right?

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.660
You’re my little piggy now, aren’t you?

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:12.760
[oinking noises]

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.220
Somebody help me!

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:16.540
Fuck this.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.240
Please! Somebody help me!

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.260
Somebody help me! I don’t wanna die!

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:28.949
No! Just don’t! I’m sorry to have to do
this to a fellow creature of the night,

01:26:28.949 --> 01:26:34.280
but I demand that you let her go! This is
nonconsensual and She has the right to say

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.800
no!

01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:38.640
You are so precious! What’s your name, darling?

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.280
Aurora Nightshade! I am a fellow child of
the night like yourself.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.380
Are you now?

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.520
Yes, I am, but this must not continue.

01:26:46.530 --> 01:26:50.699
I understand the need and the hunger to feed
but if this was merely about feeding,

01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:52.590
I wouldn’t dream of standing in your way

01:26:52.590 --> 01:27:01.429
A child of the Toreador with her mortal prey.
But this is about sexual assault and we are

01:27:01.429 --> 01:27:02.460
above that!

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.180
We are?

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:07.480
Yes, we are, my sweet sister in crimson!

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.520
And I’m sure you’re aware of the Sanguinomicon!

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:17.750
And all the vast amounts of pleasure that
are there to be had and desires to be quenched-

01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:21.370
You are so cute. Mwah!

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:23.540
[neck snapping]

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.120
What the fuck, Paisley?!?

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.000
Oh, was that yours?

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.139
I didn’t even get a chance to fuck her!

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:41.300
Oh, whatever, Romeo. Why don’t you fuck
my new pet instead?

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:45.180
Yeah, what really want I want to do is fuck
your hyperventilating crying-

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:48.480
[crying]

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:54.220
Paisley, she is peeing on the floor!

01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:55.230
[laughter]

01:27:55.230 --> 01:28:00.900
Sakkara’s gonna be upset. Somebody get me
a rolled up newspaper.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:01.900
[laughter]

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:09.160
Oh man, that’s so funny! You know what’d
be even funnier?

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.670
If I killed your little pet!

01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:12.340
You let her go! She’s mine!

01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.330
You know what? You killed the one that was
mine. It’s only fair!

01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:17.260
She has to live and suffer for what she did!

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:20.030
I don’t give a fuck what she did!

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.380
You want her to live, so maybe it’s time
for you to learn that you don’t always get

01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:24.660
what you want!

01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:25.660
Fuck you!

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.680
Fuck me?

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.720
Fuck you!

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.480
Fuck me?

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.220
Fuck you!

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:30.900
Fuck me, huh?

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.639
Enough! Enough! Both of you!

01:28:33.639 --> 01:28:34.639
But she-

01:28:34.639 --> 01:28:37.560
This arguing, I will not have in my home,
between my children!

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.630
Paisley, the girl now belongs to me.

01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:41.620
But-

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:50.760
There will be no buts. The girl is now mine, to
do with as I please. I will let you seed her,

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.720
though.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:56.020
You best get a good vintage out of her or
I will show you what it means to be punished,

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.020
understood?

01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.020
Yes…

01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.590
Yes, ma’am.

01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:06.160
Good. Now, Tony, you are out an offering,
but you should pick one from the room.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.660
Paisley will make it up to the one whose offering
you take.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:23.720
This one’s not as pretty as Aurora was,
but I think she’ll do.

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:28.180
You should be glad. All the others, they will
die tonight.

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.980
You...if you can please my “son” with
what you have between your legs, you may wake

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:32.800
up tomorrow.

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:37.600
Now, strip and pleasure him.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.270
I do not want that thing rotting in my home.
Take it to the ovens.

01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:49.280
Now, I will be in my room. Let this charade
end. Feed as you will.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:58.800
[chaos]

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.720
Well, you know what to do. Get to whipping
it out, come on!

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:23.940
Now, I feel like getting drunk.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.820
You, drink!

01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:29.880
Are you fucking kidding me?!?

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:37.400
[sounds of chaos]

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:47.400
Darling, in about a half hour, I’m going
to tear your throat out with my teeth. You’re

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.880
going to die. Right here.

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:55.340
And there’s nothing you can do about it,
so if you want to, at least, not feel it,

01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:06.800
You better start chugging right the fuck now!
Drunker you are, the less it’s going to

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.800
hurt!

01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:13.640
[sounds of torture and despair]

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.540
That was fucking horrible!

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:21.880
You know, Paisley’s daddy pretty much paid
for her to become one of us.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.949
What?

01:31:22.949 --> 01:31:28.850
Fucking rich oil asshole. Congressman. One
of the few who actually knows about us.

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:33.640
Some shit went down at Port Authority last
year, after the eclipse and the blackout.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:39.469
I don’t really know what happened, but he
pretty much said that he was going to come

01:31:39.469 --> 01:31:41.110
down on us hard

01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:45.702
If we didn’t do something about his sweet
little girl who had a brain tumor or some

01:31:45.702 --> 01:31:46.700
shit.

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:54.560
So, you’re telling me that that monster
in there was sitting and dying in a hospital

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:55.340
bed

01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:56.560
And now she’s this?

01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:59.760
No, from what I can tell, Paisley’s always
been that way.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:03.510
Tumor slowed her down a bit, made her bed-ridden,
but she’s always been a terrible fucking

01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:04.510
person.

01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:07.460
I think that’s why my mom decided to turn
her in the first place.

01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:15.760
She wanted to see what would happen if someone
who was already a monster became one of us.

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.280
That and the suitcase full of money probably
helped.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.360
What is that smell?

01:32:29.370 --> 01:32:31.490
The basement.

01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:35.740
You never did tell me what was in the basement.

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:39.300
Are you sure you want to know?

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:47.420
[water dripping]

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.000
Wait. Oh my god, is that what I think it is?

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:23.200
[banging]

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:08.960
[babies crying]

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.600
Oh my god!

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.160
Oh my god! Oh my fucking god!

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:28.150
You wanted to see it.

01:35:28.150 --> 01:35:30.300
What about the rules?!?

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:34.220
They said we’re not allowed to feed on kids!
They were very specific about that!

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:39.570
No one is going to miss child that nobody
knows about except for the ones who bred it.

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.780
Honestly, that’s what they’re probably
doing to the salesgirl back there.

01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:48.270
Have enough of the male servants fuck her
until she gets knocked up

01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:52.940
and when she’s ready to pop, Sakkara will
serve up her baby like it’s a Chateau Margaux.

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:57.200
This is the most horrifying thing I’ve ever…

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.820
This is who you are now.

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.020
Did you think the rules were to protect them
from us? The rules are there to protect us

01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:04.030
from them!

01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:08.880
If the average person knew what monsters we
were, they’d rise up and kill all of us.

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:15.160
It already happened once. Stalin did it after
World War II. He purged the Soviet Union of

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:16.170
all of us.

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:20.060
Sakkara was there You should hear her go on
about it.

01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:24.560
That’s why the good ol’ U. S. of A. had
no problem working with us.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.120
We’re enemies of Communism.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:36.140
Help me! Please, help me! Please help me!
Why aren’t you helping me?!?

01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:51.080
[ankle snapping]

01:36:52.640 --> 01:37:01.740
Please! Please! Please!

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.500
[screams]

01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:15.300
Oh, hey! Hi, Miranda and whatever your name
is.

01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:18.340
I know this isn’t like your thing and I’m
trying to respectful of that.

01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:23.480
So, I’m going to take her out of here. So
sorry. You keep doing what you’re doing.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.700
Don’t mind me. So sorry about this.

01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:27.960
Let me go!

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.650
Shut the fuck up!

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:39.240
Hey, everybody! Look what I got!

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.840
[vampires cheer]

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.520
I think I’m going to be sick.

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.350
There’s nothing in you to throw up. You
have to stop kidding yourself. This is who

01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:47.480
you are.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.900
What about you? Isn’t this who you are too?

01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:07.300
Theresa, let me tell you about the best feeling
I’ve ever had. The most wonderful euphoric

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:11.619
joy

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:15.310
Was the last time I saw my parents.

01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:19.720
I didn’t mean to.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:29.100
I had held back for so long that Iost control.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:43.660
I fed on them and it felt good. Feeling their
fear, tasting their blood. It was amazing...

01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:50.620
And then, I saw what I had done and I couldn’t
live with myself anymore.

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:57.680
I went outside that morning to go lay out in the
sun, so I’d die and I wouldn’t have to

01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.760
face what I was.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:05.440
So, why are you still here?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.880
It rained. For four days straight. And by
the time it was done,

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.250
I realized that just because I was a monster,
but I didn’t have to act like one.

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:23.020
I applied for the donor program immediately.

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:27.970
How did you survive those three months?

01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:33.280
Do you know how easy it is to find a would-be
rapist in this city, if you really want to?

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:38.880
I figured if I was going to feed, I’d feed
on scumbags.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.920
Twelve less predators in the world...and...
and then I never fed again.

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.860
I want to be like that.

01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:49.680
And yet, you want to be with Allison.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.760
What do you mean?

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.200
Allison has killed more people than Ted Bundy, John Wayne
Gacy, and Henry Lee Lucas combined.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.360
You could probably fill a concert hall with
how many people she’s killed.

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.960
I didn’t tell you from before what she and
Tony got in trouble for, did I?

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.280
No, you didn’t.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.380
Do you remember the Tsunami in 2004? You might
have been a teen during it,

01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:18.940
but there was an earthquake in the Indian
Ocean. A 9.0. Triggered a tsunami…

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:24.020
I vaguely remember my parents watching it
on the news.

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:28.600
Around that time, Tony and Allison took a
trip to Thailand.

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.240
Why?

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.920
There were an awful lot of orphaned children
after the Tsunami.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:42.679
What? No…how is that “bending” the rules?

01:40:42.679 --> 01:40:44.970
I think you know the answer to that.

01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:46.909
No one will miss those kids.

01:40:46.909 --> 01:40:52.570
As it was, there were regular businessmen,
taking their pick for kiddie porn and slavery.

01:40:52.570 --> 01:40:55.369
So Allison and Tony were just two more invaders.

01:40:55.369 --> 01:41:00.330
But the Hierarchy got pissed off that they
were so close to a news story.

01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:06.120
That’s…That’s horrible.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.400
She’s a monster, Theresa. So are you.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.840
So am I.

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:20.400
It’s whether or not you act like one that
matters.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:26.820
You can apply for the donor program, but don’t
forget what you are,

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:34.480
because if you do, that’s when you’ll
really hurt the ones you loved before...this.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:48.080
Come on! Rut! Fucking rut! You fucking pigs!

01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:54.810
Huh. That’s the kind of ass the Puerto Rican
guys like.

01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:55.960
Paisley! Christ!

01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:02.000
What?!? They like big asses! They write songs
about it, dumbie!

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.660
When he’s done, you’re next.

01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.360
Oh, phone!

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:21.560
Come on, honey give us a smile! Come on! Give
us a nice little smile!

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.640
Fine. Be that way. Bet you that you break
before I get bored.

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.520
[laughing]

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:43.260
[screams of torment]

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:20.660
How can you do this? I don’t want to be like this.

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:27.820
How can you be such fucking monsters?!? You
used to be just like them!

01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:32.980
Someone need some ointment for her butthurt?

01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:36.640
Little girl thinks she’s better than all
of us.

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:43.720
Princess, even when I was like them, I still
would’ve laughed my ass off when I made

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.120
you eat your own shit.

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.740
You wouldn’t have even been the first.

01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:55.199
So, you better thank your lucky fucking stars
that some dumb bitch met you and decided to

01:43:55.199 --> 01:43:56.310
turn you,

01:43:56.310 --> 01:44:01.280
because if I found you, instead, you’d be
doing little doggy tricks, like that little

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.280
shit

01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:10.760
Remember, honey: just because you’re one
of us now, doesn’t make you one of us.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.040
You fucking cunt!

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:19.380
Oh, ladies! Ladies, ladies. Listen as much as I’d
love to see a cat fight,

01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:22.940
Allison told me she has a present for you.
You should go see what it is.

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.780
Why should I fucking trust you? This is just
going to be some goddamn trick.

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:33.619
Oh, you know what I’m hurt. Because really, after all
those powers I was nice enough to give you,

01:44:33.619 --> 01:44:35.050
you act this way towards me?

01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:39.680
I mean, hey, if you want Butch over here to
rip your fucking head, then that’s fine.

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:43.880
Otherwise, no trick. Allison told me she has
a present.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.260
Honest Injun.

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:47.180
[laughs]

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.580
[knocking]

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:08.300
What the fuck, Allison?!? What the hell are
you doing?

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:14.460
Baby, been waiting for you. Look I got you
a present. Isn’t she pretty?

01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:18.520
I was going to put a giant pink bow on her head
but I thought she looked better naked.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:24.620
They always do. Besides, it’d be silly to
put a tuxedo on a hamburger, right?

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:31.300
This is what you wanted to show me?

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:34.220
This is what Tony said I had to see?

01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:38.500
Allison, this is...this is bullshit. She is
a person!

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:45.000
I don’t want to be like this. I don’t
want to be like those monsters down there.

01:45:45.010 --> 01:45:49.550
And why are you even talking to him still?
I thought you two broke up!

01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:55.080
Don’t worry about Tony. Just come here and
see what I’ve gotten for you.

01:45:55.100 --> 01:46:02.900
No, I can’t do this. I'm not down for this. You know what Miranda was right about
you!

01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:06.480
Oh, Miranda is so melodramatic.

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.680
Eventually, you’ll learn to ignore her,
just like everyone else. Besides, the sun’s

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:13.840
coming up.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:16.120
If you go out right now, you’ll be killed.

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:26.340
I...I don’t think I care anymore. I think...I
think...I want to see the sun, one last time.

01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:32.540
Baby, it would kill me if something happened
to you.

01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:39.980
Just come back inside. What?

01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:05.520
Just a taste. A little taste. You don’t
like it, I’ll find you someplace safe to

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.640
sleep until the sun goes down.

01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:18.400
Besides, if she tastes anything like her sister
or cousin over there, you’re in for a treat.

01:47:18.409 --> 01:47:24.180
No no! No, Allison, don’t! Let her go!

01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:29.140
Stop, let her go! Please, Allison!

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:34.800
[moaning]

01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:37.860
Oh, it tastes so…

01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:41.180
This is so wrong.

01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:45.080
There’s no wrong for us anymore. Just what
we want when we want it. For however long

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:46.460
we want!

01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:48.300
I don’t want to be like-

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:53.420
Stop going through the motions and start being
what you are!

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.240
[scream echoing]

01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:34.140
[phone ringing]

01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:52.640
Hey...hey, mom. I know. No, I’ve just...

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:56.880
I’ve been sick.

01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:03.300
I know it’s been a month but I’ve been
sick this whole...

01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:14.080
I don’t know about those classes. I might
just drop them. I’ll have to see.

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:19.720
No, Mika and I broke up.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:26.960
Yeah, I know. Thanks mom.

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:35.980
Uh no please don’t visit just yet. I have all
these finals to…

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:41.580
Seriously, don’t come visit.

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:45.560
I have my finals to do and then I may-

01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:01.900
I know. Thank you.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.980
I love you too.

01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:15.360
No no nothing’s the matter, mom.

01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:23.500
Give my love to dad and Matt okay?

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:34.500
[cries]

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:00.620
Oh god! You’re not in the basement yet!

01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.840
No, it’s good! It’s good! They’re still
asleep! They’re still asleep!

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.120
If you just-

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:10.400
[anguished cries]

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.720
[door creaking]

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:42.320
Theresa!

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.660
Come back to bed!

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.660
Come on.

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:50.500
Come back to bed.

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:56.380
Hey! Hey!

01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:15.620
[credits music]

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:16.560
Thank you so much for changing your mind.

01:56:16.570 --> 01:56:20.719
We understand how hard this must have been
for you.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.620
The last time we met, you were understandably
upset.

01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:29.260
But it’s good to know that you’ve seen
that La Reina’s way is the only way that

01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:31.500
this gets resolved.

01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:39.969
I knew she was coming back. Didn’t I tell
you? The mirror does not lie.

01:56:39.969 --> 01:56:44.280
I knew she would eventually see things our
way.

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:51.460
There is nothing good that can come of being
associated with Sakkara.

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:59.340
All that bloodshed. All that madness. You
must be tired of that.

01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:08.320
She is. She told me herself. Last time we
helped her. I am sure she remembers.

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:11.600
How could you forget something like that?

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:17.520
How long was that? Ninety days, while you
waited for the program to kick in?

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.119
Polina, I am sure the girl can speak for herself.

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:31.840
So, my dear, would you be the eyes that we
ask for?

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:38.190
You will help us know the moves of the usurper
and her children?

01:57:38.190 --> 01:57:41.700
Yeah. I’ll help you.

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:48.540
I’m not joining your Order or anything,
but I can’t do this shit anymore.

01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:56.440
I think the last straw for me was that girl,
Theresa. That night-

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:04.340
There there. Soon, it will all be over.

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:15.260
Order will overcome chaos. We have a goddess
on our side.
