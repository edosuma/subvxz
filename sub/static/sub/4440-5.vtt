00:12.672 --> 00:15.574
God, it's so nice to hav
an afternoon off.

00:15.575 --> 00:17.810
I'm glad you're able to
come out to lunch with me.

00:17.811 --> 00:21.247
Well, Mondays are
usually pretty light.

00:21.248 --> 00:23.716
Um, it's Thursday.

00:23.717 --> 00:27.386
Right. I'm just saying that
Mondays work, too,

00:27.387 --> 00:28.754
lunch-wise.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.424
Jenna?

00:31.425 --> 00:32.825
Oh, my God, Nick! Hey!

00:32.826 --> 00:34.326
I thought it was you.

00:34.327 --> 00:36.461
Uh, this is my
neighbor Ryan.
Hey.

00:36.462 --> 00:39.096
I profiled Nick for the Local
Hero of the Week segment

00:39.097 --> 00:40.930
on the 5:00 news.

00:40.931 --> 00:44.099
He spent a whole year in Africa
building houses for the poor.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.733
Solar powered, of course.

00:45.734 --> 00:47.268
They each have
the carbon footprint

00:47.269 --> 00:49.503
of a tiny African baby.

00:49.504 --> 00:51.671
Oh, and I made them shoes.

00:51.672 --> 00:54.207
Nick is an amazing person.

00:54.208 --> 00:57.845
Hey, it's all about the kids...
who have shoes now.

00:57.846 --> 01:00.781
Wow, you're like the great white
Oprah, aren't you?

01:00.782 --> 01:03.151
Actually, I think of myself
as post-racial.

01:04.553 --> 01:06.154
What do you do, Ryan?

01:06.155 --> 01:10.959
Oh, um, well, it's
Thursday, so, uh...

01:10.960 --> 01:13.629
Oh, Ryan used to be
a very powerful lawyer,

01:13.630 --> 01:15.364
but now he's taking
some time off.

01:15.365 --> 01:17.132
Ah... to do what?

01:17.133 --> 01:20.901
Uh, you know...

01:20.902 --> 01:24.637
Well, that sounds...

01:26.440 --> 01:28.373
Come on, mate,
give us a bit

01:28.374 --> 01:29.774
of that gouda
I'm smelling.

01:29.775 --> 01:31.643
Wilfred, no,
you can't have cheese.

01:31.644 --> 01:33.177
What am I supposed to eat?

01:33.178 --> 01:35.113
The grass down here tastes
like shit

01:35.114 --> 01:36.547
and the shit tastes like grass!

01:38.717 --> 01:40.951
Wilfred? Wilfred!

01:40.952 --> 01:42.453
Wilfred, come back!

01:42.454 --> 01:45.823
I'll go.
You two catch up.

01:45.824 --> 01:47.425
(urine splashing)

01:47.426 --> 01:49.627
You know cheese
isn't good for you.

01:49.628 --> 01:51.963
I'm sick of you telling me
what I can and can't do.

01:51.964 --> 01:55.033
It's like those baby killers
say, "My body, my choice."

01:55.034 --> 01:57.035
I'm sorry, but apparently,
looking after you is

01:57.036 --> 01:58.737
my sole reason for getting
out of bed.

01:58.738 --> 02:01.506
What am I doing with my life?

02:01.507 --> 02:02.807
Nothing.

02:02.808 --> 02:04.708
Don't undersell
yourself.

02:04.709 --> 02:07.344
<i>How many people can watch
a whole season of The Wire</i>

02:07.345 --> 02:09.446
in one sitting?
Not many, I'd wager.

02:09.447 --> 02:10.913
That shit is dense.

02:10.914 --> 02:13.082
The way Jenna jumped in
to cover for me...

02:13.083 --> 02:14.350
like I'm some kind of loser.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.118
Is that what people think of me?

02:16.119 --> 02:17.387
What are you,
a golden retriever?

02:17.388 --> 02:19.522
What do you care
what other people think?

02:19.523 --> 02:20.690
Uh, excuse me.

02:20.691 --> 02:22.025
Would you sign
a petition

02:22.026 --> 02:23.460
to support the
South Venice Hospice?

02:23.461 --> 02:25.629
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Just sign

02:25.630 --> 02:27.531
right here, but don't worry
about the address part.

02:27.532 --> 02:28.865
You can just leave that blank.

02:28.866 --> 02:31.201
Why would I do that?

02:31.202 --> 02:33.970
Well, you could
list a shelter or something.

02:33.971 --> 02:35.339
Shelter? You think
I'm homeless?

02:35.340 --> 02:38.108
Do I look homeless?

02:38.109 --> 02:41.779
Well, you were talking
to a dog.

02:44.916 --> 02:46.650
Here we are.

02:46.651 --> 02:49.119
Whoa, you said
we were going
for a walk.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.223
A walk, Ryan, which by
definition means no destination.

02:52.224 --> 02:54.058
Even a cat knows that.

02:54.059 --> 02:56.828
I thought it would be a good
idea for us to get off the couch

02:56.829 --> 02:58.730
and do some volunteer work.

02:58.731 --> 03:00.365
You mean like community service?

03:00.366 --> 03:02.000
That's for drunk drivers
and wife beaters,

03:02.001 --> 03:04.169
not decent folk like us.
Now come on.

03:04.170 --> 03:07.071
Let's go over to that playground
and blaze a fatty.

03:07.072 --> 03:08.973
Come on. It'll feel good
to do something worthwhile.

03:08.974 --> 03:10.441
Besides, these people have

03:10.442 --> 03:12.176
a lifetime of wisdom
to share with us.

03:12.177 --> 03:15.178
Like what, how to keep from
sitting on your balls?

03:15.179 --> 03:16.613
Wilfred, we're doing this.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.315
You can't make me
do whatever you want.

03:18.316 --> 03:19.583
You're not my husband!

03:19.584 --> 03:23.119
Oh, my God! The stench!

03:23.120 --> 03:25.454
Wilfred, you can't
pee here.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.656
Why not?
Everyone else is.

03:27.657 --> 03:30.158
Hi. We're here to volunteer.

03:30.159 --> 03:32.293
Oh, fantastic.

03:32.294 --> 03:34.329
Stay right there. I'm gonna
start planning your parade.

03:34.330 --> 03:35.964
Just a cake will be fine.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.900
Anyway, uh, this is Wilfred,
and I'm...

03:38.901 --> 03:41.202
You know what? Let's not bother
with the names, you know?

03:41.203 --> 03:43.772
If you make it through the
day, we'll revisit this.

03:43.773 --> 03:44.873
Kill me, please!

03:44.874 --> 03:47.109
What?
I wanna die!

03:47.110 --> 03:50.112
Why won't they let me die?!

03:50.113 --> 03:51.714
Oh, you don't mean that.

03:51.715 --> 03:53.282
You've got a lot
of living to do.

03:53.283 --> 03:54.984
There are mountains
to be climbed.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.586
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's gonna change his diaper

03:56.587 --> 03:59.255
on those mountains, huh?
These people are ready to die.

03:59.256 --> 04:01.424
Hope is the last thing
they need.

04:01.425 --> 04:04.326
A coffin is the last thing
they need. Up top.
I just thought...

04:04.327 --> 04:07.596
Uh-uh, our only job is to offer
them peace and comfort.

04:07.597 --> 04:10.966
for their final days,
not cheery little pep talks.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.401
Think you can handle that?

04:12.402 --> 04:14.302
Uh-huh.
Okay. All right, Mr. Gordon.

04:14.303 --> 04:16.004
You can't do that.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.574
Can't eat cheese,
can't jack morphine.

04:18.575 --> 04:20.276
<i>Is there anything
I can do, Ryan?</i>

04:20.277 --> 04:22.945
(Haitian accent):
That dog can't be in here!

04:22.946 --> 04:25.815
Oh, it's okay.
He's a service dog.

04:25.816 --> 04:28.117
There's something about that dog
I don't like.

04:28.118 --> 04:31.220
Something about him
rattles me bones.

04:31.221 --> 04:32.521
I ain't rattling
your bones.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.089
Not without
a few drinks in me.

04:34.090 --> 04:35.691
Have a nice day.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.293
I don't get it, Ryan.

04:37.294 --> 04:40.096
No one in America
wants to be a nurse?

04:40.097 --> 04:42.265
Admit it, Ryan,
you're not getting

04:42.266 --> 04:44.702
any satisfaction
out of this.

04:44.703 --> 04:47.271
You're only here so Jenna
and everyone will think
you're a do-gooder.

04:47.272 --> 04:51.042
Yeah, okay, I want
to be admired.

04:51.043 --> 04:54.279
I want people to think
I'm a good person

04:54.280 --> 04:56.747
like that douchebag
in the park.

04:56.748 --> 04:58.349
What's wrong with that?

04:58.350 --> 05:01.652
The only opinion
that matters is yours.

05:01.653 --> 05:06.124
Come on. Let's get stoned
and then go home and get stoned.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.659
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither are you.

05:08.660 --> 05:12.362
Fine. You want to heal the sick
like Florence Henderson,

05:12.363 --> 05:13.931
be my guest.

05:13.932 --> 05:15.833
That's Florence Nightingale.

05:15.834 --> 05:19.003
No, I'm talking about the
episode where Jan got the mumps.

05:19.004 --> 05:21.372
Or was that Bobby?
And why did they need Alice?

05:21.373 --> 05:23.508
Sure, they had six kids,

05:23.509 --> 05:25.676
but Carol didn't
even work.

05:25.677 --> 05:28.946
I guess what I'm trying to
say is I'm very, very high.

05:28.947 --> 05:30.448
I'm gonna take a nap.

05:33.318 --> 05:37.188
Mr. Helms, I took that pile
of photos on your dresser

05:37.189 --> 05:38.990
and I put them in
this scrapbook

05:38.991 --> 05:43.128
so you could look
at your loved ones.

05:43.129 --> 05:45.864
If there's anything else
I can do for you...

05:45.865 --> 05:47.399
Wait.
Yes?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.667
Do that thing you did
for me in Paris.

05:49.668 --> 05:51.770
I'm not sure I...

05:51.771 --> 05:54.372
Come on, Betty.
The war's over.

05:54.373 --> 05:57.509
Take these trousers off
and toss my salad.

05:57.510 --> 05:59.077
What?

05:59.078 --> 06:01.479
Do it, you little whore!

06:01.480 --> 06:04.416
Get your tongue in there
and play with yourself.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.719
That's it.
I'm done.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.454
Hey, volunteer guy,
scrub that out.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.790
Actually, I was just
about to get my dog and...

06:10.791 --> 06:13.993
(alarm blaring)

06:13.994 --> 06:15.294
(monitor flatlines)

06:15.295 --> 06:17.696
Oh, my God, your dog.

06:17.697 --> 06:21.165
Officer, I swear,
she told me she was three.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.033
I'm sorry.
I'll get him out...

06:23.034 --> 06:25.402
No, no, no, he sensed that
Mr. Gordon was leaving us

06:25.403 --> 06:27.404
and he didn't want him
to die alone.

06:27.405 --> 06:29.606
Your dog did
a beautiful thing.

06:29.607 --> 06:32.976
He did?

06:32.977 --> 06:36.045
Well, compassion was
the first trick I taught him.

06:36.046 --> 06:38.748
Hi, I'm Ryan.

06:38.749 --> 06:42.218
Everybody, this is Ryan

06:42.219 --> 06:44.688
and his dog Wilfred.

06:51.701 --> 06:54.637
I knew Wilfred was special,
but this is amazing.

06:54.638 --> 06:56.906
Well, I'm not sure he
actually did anything.

06:56.907 --> 06:58.641
No, I've heard about
this kind of thing.

06:58.642 --> 07:01.244
There was this cat in Ohio
that predicted 22 deaths.

07:01.245 --> 07:02.912
They say that it's
a chemical thing,

07:02.913 --> 07:05.281
something that
they can smell.
Hmm.

07:05.282 --> 07:06.649
I just thought he went in
there to pass out...

07:07.885 --> 07:09.519
...sleep.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.021
So, Wilfred has a gift.
How about that.

07:12.022 --> 07:14.557
JENNA:
I am so proud of him.

07:14.558 --> 07:17.227
I'm proud of you both.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.296
Come here, Wilfred.
Come here.

07:19.297 --> 07:22.933
I'm gonna make you
a special dinner.
(playful growling)

07:22.934 --> 07:24.734
Hey, if you're not
doing anything, do
you want to join us?

07:24.735 --> 07:26.069
I'm just going
to toss a salad.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.804
Sounds great.

07:27.805 --> 07:30.507
Okay. (playful growling)

07:30.508 --> 07:32.576
Think you might be
disappointed, mate.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.944
Sometimes the term
"tossed salad"

07:34.945 --> 07:36.112
means a bowl of lettuce.

07:38.482 --> 07:40.216
Drop it.

07:40.217 --> 07:41.984
Wilfred, come on.
I don't want you to be sick

07:41.985 --> 07:43.986
when we go back to
the hospice tomorrow.

07:43.987 --> 07:45.888
Hmm, yeah, I don't
think I'm going back.

07:45.889 --> 07:47.056
What? Why?

07:47.057 --> 07:48.791
I know you're getting off

07:48.792 --> 07:50.926
on being a big hero,
but let's look at the reality.

07:50.927 --> 07:53.763
I'm a dog with a wondrous
spiritual gift.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.999
And you're a man who made
a 30-foot paperclip
chain last week.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.368
Wilfred--
Who has the power now, Ryan?

07:58.369 --> 08:00.136
Cause it's feeling like...

08:00.137 --> 08:04.708
(clicking tongue)

08:04.709 --> 08:06.544
me.

08:06.545 --> 08:08.112
If I'm gonna do this,
it's gonna cost you.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.349
Okay, what do you want?

08:11.350 --> 08:14.152
What I want is--
whatever I want.

08:14.153 --> 08:15.686
But that stuff makes you--
(farting)

08:15.687 --> 08:17.054
Sorry, didn't catch
that. Makes me what?

08:17.055 --> 08:18.089
It makes you--
(farting)

08:18.090 --> 08:19.490
Come again?

08:19.491 --> 08:21.191
I'm not playing this--
(farting)

08:21.192 --> 08:23.060
Are you--
(farts)

08:23.061 --> 08:25.262
I--
(long fart)

08:25.263 --> 08:26.496
Oh, God! Oh!

08:26.497 --> 08:28.131
Don't deny yourself, Ryan.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.399
Enjoy it.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.734
Enjoy me.

08:33.404 --> 08:35.038
Look at that.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.307
It's like Wilfred is an
angel of mercy to them.

08:38.743 --> 08:40.210
I'm glad you came back.

08:40.211 --> 08:42.379
It's nice to see someone
who really cares.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.215
There's a lot of jerks who
volunteer just to make
themselves look good.

08:45.216 --> 08:47.884
You're kidding.
Do people actually do that?

08:47.885 --> 08:49.553
Oh, yeah.

08:49.554 --> 08:52.356
That dog need to go back
where he come from--

08:52.357 --> 08:55.258
the gates of Hell.

08:55.259 --> 08:57.294
Maybe you should go back
to where you came from--

08:57.295 --> 08:59.629
right over there
where you were standing--

08:59.630 --> 09:00.997
before you came over here.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.499
(sighs)

09:03.500 --> 09:05.401
Don't mind Ruby.

09:05.402 --> 09:07.837
She's been a total bitch since
the earthquake took her family.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.107
Oh, look!

09:10.108 --> 09:13.244
It's like Wilfred can
sense that Mrs. Miller's

09:13.245 --> 09:14.979
ready to leave us.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.382
I'm going to go
call her family.

09:17.383 --> 09:19.418
Yeah, you can run,
but you can't hide.

09:19.419 --> 09:21.787
But you can't really run either,
can you?

09:23.489 --> 09:24.856
Checkmate.

09:24.857 --> 09:27.092
I'm reading you
a book, Mr. Helms.

09:27.093 --> 09:29.795
Did I ever tell you about
the time I choked a Jap?

09:29.796 --> 09:33.599
1942. I was at
my first Brandeis mixer.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.667
I think it's time
for your nap.

09:38.806 --> 09:40.040
What's going on?

09:40.041 --> 09:41.241
(monitor beeping)
(sighs)

09:41.242 --> 09:42.509
Mrs. Miller hasn't
passed yet.

09:42.510 --> 09:44.244
Maybe Wilfred's wrong.

09:44.245 --> 09:45.645
Was yesterday just a fluke?

09:45.646 --> 09:48.282
No, no, Wilfred's
done this a lot.

09:48.283 --> 09:51.317
He predicted 22 deaths
at a hospital in Ohio.

09:51.318 --> 09:53.587
I thought that was a cat.

09:53.588 --> 09:56.023
Lame-stream media.

09:56.024 --> 09:58.692
Piss off!
I'm working!

09:58.693 --> 10:00.727
Maybe he could use
a little walk.

10:02.530 --> 10:03.963
What's the problem, Wilfred?

10:03.964 --> 10:05.598
You said you could do this.

10:05.599 --> 10:07.633
Save it, Ryan.
I'm under enough pressure.

10:07.634 --> 10:09.868
Where'd you get
that key card?

10:09.869 --> 10:11.569
That there be none
of your business.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.272
(humming tune)
Whoa, you can't do this.

10:15.273 --> 10:18.375
I can do
whatever I want.

10:18.376 --> 10:20.611
That's the deal, right?

10:20.612 --> 10:22.079
I'm not kidding
around here, Wilfred.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.247
This is serious stuff.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.715
Some of it is.

10:24.716 --> 10:28.419
Some of it's just
over-the-counter crap.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.922
This is not going to happen.
All right, then,

10:30.923 --> 10:33.491
well, I guess
we're through here.

10:33.492 --> 10:36.127
I'll go back to being a dog,
and you can go back

10:36.128 --> 10:39.031
to your celebrated status
as a land baron in Farmville.

10:43.269 --> 10:45.936
Bottoms up.

10:48.673 --> 10:52.075
Oh, that's right,
you're driving.

10:54.444 --> 10:56.845
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

10:56.846 --> 10:59.882
I have to go shepherd
Mrs. Miller's soul to Heaven.

10:59.883 --> 11:01.617
Or Hell.

11:01.618 --> 11:02.985
I leave those details
to others.

11:06.890 --> 11:09.059
I promise you,
she was so close to...

11:09.060 --> 11:11.594
She was right on
the brink of death.

11:11.595 --> 11:14.231
Oh...

11:14.232 --> 11:15.432
(monitor beeping)

11:15.433 --> 11:18.102
Tell the truth, Wilfred.

11:18.103 --> 11:19.870
This is all just a scam,
isn't it?

11:19.871 --> 11:21.739
These things take time.

11:21.740 --> 11:24.208
Trust me, she's on her way out.

11:24.209 --> 11:26.710
Just get me some dinner.
I want pizza.

11:26.711 --> 11:29.046
Huh! The last thing
I'm giving you is more cheese.

11:29.047 --> 11:31.749
Pizza is what I want.
We had a deal.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.217
Well, that's when
I was stupid enough

11:33.218 --> 11:35.152
to think you were for real.
The deal's off.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.921
Now let's get out
of here

11:36.922 --> 11:40.091
before we completely
humiliate ourselves.

11:40.092 --> 11:42.560
I hate to think that
any minute now...

11:42.561 --> 11:45.196
(alarm wailing)

11:48.033 --> 11:50.635
(monitor flatlines)

11:50.636 --> 11:53.504
So, about that pizza...

11:53.505 --> 11:55.439
Did you...?

11:55.440 --> 11:59.043
Oh, my God, Wilfred
did it again.

11:59.044 --> 12:01.512
And I want the kind
with cheese in the crust.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.148
(steady tone continues)

12:08.648 --> 12:09.781
You lied to me!

12:09.782 --> 12:11.182
You told me
you had a gift.

12:11.183 --> 12:13.217
And you told me
we were getting pizza.

12:13.218 --> 12:15.086
What's the bigger
lie here, mate?
I ask you that.

12:15.087 --> 12:16.554
I can't believe
I let this happen.

12:16.555 --> 12:17.888
You killed that woman!

12:17.889 --> 12:20.724
Now that's just crazy talk.

12:20.725 --> 12:22.526
You're really overreacting here.

12:22.527 --> 12:23.928
I saw you with the pillow.

12:23.929 --> 12:24.996
I was fluffing it!

12:24.997 --> 12:26.197
Over her face.

12:26.198 --> 12:29.200
I'm just doing God's work, mate.

12:29.201 --> 12:31.436
And a lot more efficiently,
I must say.

12:31.437 --> 12:33.937
Well, it stops now.
(knocking)

12:33.938 --> 12:36.540
Hey! I've been waiting
for you to get home.

12:36.541 --> 12:39.109
I told my producer
about your work at the hospice,

12:39.110 --> 12:41.245
and he agreed that you
and Wilfred would be perfect

12:41.246 --> 12:43.380
for our next Hero
of the Week segment.

12:43.381 --> 12:45.583
Oh, I'm no hero.

12:45.584 --> 12:47.619
Of course you are.
Look, it'll be great.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.320
Me and my cameraman will follow
you around the hospice

12:49.321 --> 12:51.689
so we can show the whole world
what you've done.

12:51.690 --> 12:53.625
I don't think that's such
a great idea.
Don't be so modest.

12:53.626 --> 12:55.828
Yeah, it's not like you were
doing this to impress anybody.

12:55.829 --> 12:57.797
Besides, I'm kind of
already committed

12:57.798 --> 12:59.332
for tomorrow
night's broadcast.
Look, Jen...

12:59.333 --> 13:01.234
Ryan, you're doing this.
I can't call my producer

13:01.235 --> 13:03.203
and tell him that I couldn't
book my own dog.

13:03.204 --> 13:05.506
You hear that, Ryan?
Hey, we're on.

13:05.507 --> 13:07.742
I'm gonna be
a TV star.

13:07.743 --> 13:10.645
I better start working
on my catchphrase.

13:13.282 --> 13:15.616
So I'd like to get some B-roll
of you with one of the patients.

13:15.617 --> 13:16.784
Uh, maybe him?

13:18.586 --> 13:22.155
Yeah. Or anyone else?

13:22.156 --> 13:24.524
Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm the
staff coordinator.
Jenna.

13:24.525 --> 13:26.526
I am so happy that
you're doing a story

13:26.527 --> 13:28.494
on Ryan and his
amazing work.

13:28.495 --> 13:30.763
You are an
inspiration.
I'm really not.

13:30.764 --> 13:32.398
Stop it! Okay, can you believe

13:32.399 --> 13:34.067
that I had to talk him
into this?

13:34.068 --> 13:35.969
Some people would kill
for this kind of attention.

13:35.970 --> 13:37.204
I know, right?
So humble.

13:37.205 --> 13:38.572
Excuse me.

13:38.573 --> 13:40.040
He's so sweet.
I know.

13:42.678 --> 13:44.011
We can't go through
with this.

13:44.012 --> 13:45.713
Relax, Ryan.

13:45.714 --> 13:48.083
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

13:48.084 --> 13:50.852
To be a well-regarded douchebag?

13:50.853 --> 13:52.221
No. I mean,
I-I thought...

13:52.222 --> 13:55.757
Sorry, Ryan, but I have
the power now.

13:55.758 --> 13:59.093
I can't be bothered
by what you want anymore.

13:59.094 --> 14:01.329
Now it's about
what the people want.

14:01.330 --> 14:04.531
And they want sweet release.

14:04.532 --> 14:06.700
I'm their savior, mate.

14:06.701 --> 14:11.070
So the question isn't
"What does Ryan want?"

14:11.071 --> 14:12.938
It's "What would Wilfred do?"

14:12.939 --> 14:15.039
That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.708
(snorting)

14:18.644 --> 14:22.414
(sighs)

14:22.415 --> 14:24.783
(inhales)

14:24.784 --> 14:26.818
It's show time.

14:35.194 --> 14:38.663
MAN 1: Hey, everybody,
Wilfred's back!

14:38.664 --> 14:41.165
Pick me!
I just want to die!

14:41.166 --> 14:45.670
WOMAN: No, no! I'm more
tumor than person! Pick me!

14:45.671 --> 14:47.338
MR. HELMS:
I'll suck your dick!

14:47.339 --> 14:50.107
That's a good pitch,
but I want to hear others.

14:50.108 --> 14:52.142
Ah... you.

14:52.143 --> 14:55.312
Skeletor. Why do you
deserve to die?

14:55.313 --> 14:59.684
You think you smart, but I
figure out what you are doing!

14:59.685 --> 15:01.253
Your dog be distracting
everybody

15:01.254 --> 15:03.455
so you can steal our medicines!

15:03.456 --> 15:06.058
Zip it, Ruby.
I checked the records.

15:06.059 --> 15:10.063
Your key card is the only one
accessing the drug closet.

15:10.064 --> 15:11.764
So if anything's missing,
it's on you!

15:11.765 --> 15:13.633
You'll be sorry.

15:13.634 --> 15:17.937
Soon, everybody be sorry!

15:17.938 --> 15:19.572
(panting)

15:19.573 --> 15:22.141
Don't worry, I'll deal
with the nurse.

15:22.142 --> 15:24.677
I'll make her see the light.
What are you gonna...?

15:24.678 --> 15:28.014
Hey, are you ready
for your close-up?

15:28.015 --> 15:32.352
Okay. All right, Ryan,
we're almost ready. You nervous?

15:32.353 --> 15:36.189
I'm just trying to figure out
how the hell I got here.

15:36.190 --> 15:37.724
Look, just be yourself.

15:37.725 --> 15:39.660
You know, the one thing that
being in front

15:39.661 --> 15:41.128
of the camera
has taught me is that

15:41.129 --> 15:42.363
some people are gonna
like you,

15:42.364 --> 15:43.764
and some people
are gonna hate you.

15:43.765 --> 15:45.499
But if you worry
about what other people think,

15:45.500 --> 15:47.301
you'll just drive
yourself crazy.

15:47.302 --> 15:49.103
You'll be great.

15:49.104 --> 15:51.072
So I'm just gonna start
by asking you a few questions.

15:51.073 --> 15:52.240
(loud thud)

15:52.241 --> 15:54.742
Oh, my God!

15:54.743 --> 15:56.811
It's Ruby.

15:59.881 --> 16:01.615
RYAN:
Wilfred!

16:03.118 --> 16:05.853
Oh, my God,
you did it!

16:05.854 --> 16:08.189
You really did it!

16:08.190 --> 16:11.525
Whatever I did, I did
for the both of us.

16:11.526 --> 16:14.161
No! I never wanted this!

16:14.162 --> 16:16.030
Tell me something,
Ryan.

16:16.031 --> 16:18.165
When those pathetic bags
of bones

16:18.166 --> 16:20.268
down there fall to their knees

16:20.269 --> 16:24.505
and pray for death, who do you
think they're praying to?

16:24.506 --> 16:26.574
Me! That's who.

16:26.575 --> 16:28.442
You've lost your mind.

16:28.443 --> 16:30.744
It's like you've got
some kind of God complex!

16:30.745 --> 16:32.847
I'll let you in on
a little secret, Ryan.

16:32.848 --> 16:35.282
I haven't got a God complex.

16:35.283 --> 16:40.121
<i>I am God! Thunder!</i>

16:40.122 --> 16:41.789
How did you do that?!

16:41.790 --> 16:44.158
Lucky coincidence!

16:44.159 --> 16:46.226
You've got it wrong, Wilfred...

16:46.227 --> 16:48.829
and so did I!

16:48.830 --> 16:50.931
I don't care
what other people think!

16:50.932 --> 16:54.234
The only thing that matters
is how I feel about myself!

16:54.235 --> 16:57.938
Well, it's a little late
for that.

16:57.939 --> 16:59.807
I won't let you get away
with this.

16:59.808 --> 17:02.543
Stay out of my way...

17:02.544 --> 17:07.414
or the next bed I curl up in
might be yours.

17:07.415 --> 17:09.715
No!

17:09.717 --> 17:11.752
I have something to say!

17:11.752 --> 17:13.720
You're making
a big mistake, Ryan.

17:13.721 --> 17:16.757
I don't care. I can't let this
go on any longer.

17:16.758 --> 17:18.492
Hey, look, Ruby left
a suicide note.

17:18.493 --> 17:19.661
She did?

17:21.631 --> 17:25.435
Are you sure it's in
human handwriting?

17:25.435 --> 17:26.935
I swear
that's not a racial thing.

17:26.936 --> 17:29.373
Look, Ryan, I hate
to do this,

17:29.374 --> 17:32.743
but I think there's
a bigger story here
than you and Wilfred.

17:32.744 --> 17:34.211
No, no, no, there's
no story here.

17:34.212 --> 17:36.446
We don't need this
kind of publicity.

17:36.447 --> 17:38.615
I'm sorry, but you've got
a rogue nurse who

17:38.616 --> 17:40.751
apparently stole
huge amounts of drugs
and then killed herself

17:40.752 --> 17:43.121
out of guilt.
This is a pretty
juicy exclusive.

17:43.122 --> 17:45.890
This hospice is struggling
as it is.

17:45.891 --> 17:47.859
This could shut us down.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.894
I know, and I feel
really, really badly.

17:50.602 --> 17:51.635
We're going live.

17:56.358 --> 18:01.427
You know, you had me
worried back there
at the hospice.

18:01.428 --> 18:05.331
You-you didn't actually
kill anyone, did you?

18:05.332 --> 18:07.567
No! Ryan!

18:11.338 --> 18:14.406
Except for the old lady.
I definitely killed her.

18:14.407 --> 18:15.774
Gotcha.

18:15.775 --> 18:17.176
(sighs)

18:17.177 --> 18:19.879
But seriously,
I did.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.049
Ah-ha! I'm kidding!

18:23.050 --> 18:25.351
Wait. You're kidding
that you did,

18:25.352 --> 18:27.586
or you're kidding
that you didn't?

18:29.589 --> 18:33.125
Okay, Ryan, I... I really don't
want you to get mad here,

18:33.126 --> 18:36.361
but I'm guilty...

18:36.362 --> 18:38.863
of being charming.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.100
And killing
an old lady.

18:42.101 --> 18:44.469
With kindness!

18:44.470 --> 18:45.771
And a pillow.

18:45.772 --> 18:47.973
Just kidding!

18:50.710 --> 18:52.978
Or am I?

19:00.653 --> 19:02.054
Nice kid.

19:02.055 --> 19:04.890
That is so typical
of Western thinking:

19:04.891 --> 19:06.659
If you can't see it
for yourself,

19:06.660 --> 19:08.160
it doesn't exist.

19:08.161 --> 19:10.129
I've actually got
many, many magical powers

19:10.130 --> 19:11.897
that would blow your mind.

19:11.898 --> 19:14.099
Like what?

19:14.100 --> 19:17.736
Off the top of my head,
I can make you disappear.

19:17.737 --> 19:20.005
