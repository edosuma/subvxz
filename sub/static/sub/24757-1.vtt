[cellphone ringing]

00:09.426 --> 00:10.468
Hello.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.928
Hey, Viv. Are you up?

00:12.721 --> 00:14.764
Hmm. Barely.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.437
How are you so perky
this early in the morning?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.564
Well, like Mom always said,

00:22.647 --> 00:23.815
"The early bird gets the worm."

00:23.940 --> 00:25.525
[Vivian] She did say that.

00:25.608 --> 00:26.609
Mostly to me.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.737
[laughs] Another all-nighter?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.822
Yeah, story of my life.

00:31.031 --> 00:31.906
What's up?

00:32.073 --> 00:34.617
Ah, just trying not to lose
my marbles at work.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.786
My students are driving me nuts.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.787
Ha! Story of my life.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.789
Oh, get this.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.876
So this little boy yesterday,
he spent two hours gluing

00:42.959 --> 00:45.712
exactly 17 sequins onto a big red heart.

00:46.045 --> 00:49.090
And when he was done he decided
he was allergic to girls.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.509
Hey, a little sympathy for the boys.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.386
They're still trying to figure it all out.

00:53.678 --> 00:54.679
What? It's second grade.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.556
They haven't got love
all figured out by now?

00:57.432 --> 00:58.433
[mimics sneezing]

00:59.684 --> 01:01.186
Maybe he's onto something.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.897
I know for a fact
you are not allergic to girls.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.318
So, Viv, any big plans?

01:08.401 --> 01:11.279
You going anywhere nice, with anyone nice?

01:11.362 --> 01:13.490
You really can't help yourself, can you?

01:13.573 --> 01:14.824
[Michelle] Well?

01:15.825 --> 01:17.118
Well, no.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.871
I'm not going "anywhere nice
with anyone nice."

01:20.872 --> 01:22.123
What about your algorithm?

01:22.665 --> 01:24.626
Well, we haven't launched it yet.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.044
It won't be for a couple months.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.754
When it is,
you're going to sign up, right?

01:30.048 --> 01:32.342
Maybe... eventually.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.677
Well, I hope you do.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.763
I can't wait for you to meet
your perfect match.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.682
For you.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.518
-My favorite.
-[laughs]

01:42.811 --> 01:43.937
Oh!

01:44.020 --> 01:46.022
Three-flavored pudding.
You get me!

01:46.189 --> 01:47.190
Oh, let me guess.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.901
Vanilla, butterscotch, chocolate?

01:50.693 --> 01:52.070
It's a balanced meal.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.446
[chuckles]

01:53.863 --> 01:56.491
So tell me, Viv,
what exactly does a love scientist

01:56.574 --> 01:58.326
put on their dating profile, anyway?

01:58.701 --> 01:59.828
Software developer...

01:59.911 --> 02:01.496
who is creating a dating algorithm

02:01.579 --> 02:03.039
so people can find true love.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.667
We are a lot like love scientists,

02:05.750 --> 02:08.669
but the fellowship
is completely different.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074

02:25.186 --> 02:27.814
Are you ready for eggs a la Wes Robinson?

02:28.439 --> 02:29.983
Thank you, sweetheart.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.451
Your, ah, eggs a la Wes Robinson
are burning.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.958
[telephone rings]

02:50.295 --> 02:52.046
-[Judith] Weston.
-Hello, mother.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.381
To what do I owe this pleasure?

02:53.464 --> 02:54.883
I've been calling you all morning.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.634
The Nikkei has been open for hours.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.511
I was busy.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.388
[whispers] I have to go.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.598
Call me.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.563
[Judith] Wes, where do you find
these women?

03:08.646 --> 03:11.774
I mean, doesn't it sometimes get
just a little tiresome?

03:13.276 --> 03:15.236
So, is there a reason
you're calling so early?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.447
Don't you have an empire to run?

03:17.530 --> 03:18.406
[Judith] Exactly.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.618
Your division, Robinson Tech,
is down two points.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.745
Now, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

03:24.162 --> 03:25.330
Hmm.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.873
I love you...

03:26.956 --> 03:27.916
Mother dearest?

03:28.082 --> 03:29.626
[chuckles]

03:29.876 --> 03:31.002
Oh, Wes.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.546
You know, when I appointed you
head of the tech division,

03:33.630 --> 03:35.840
I expected you to run it well.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.300
I will.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.636
Just after this cup of coffee.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.014
Yeah, maybe you just don't
have the acumen I thought you had.

03:43.097 --> 03:46.267
Or maybe you have just too many
distractions...

03:46.351 --> 03:48.353
Maybe you should stop
worrying so much.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.231
Oh, but, Wes, I do worry.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.860
You know, when you were young
your father always used to say about you--

03:55.985 --> 03:58.279
I'm not really interested
in what my father always said.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.156
Well, all right.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.326
Maybe this is something
you will be interested in.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.787
If you don't manage to turn this around,

04:05.870 --> 04:07.997
I'll have to rethink your position
in the company.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.165
How's that?

04:12.627 --> 04:13.628
[cellphone chirps]

04:26.432 --> 04:28.393
[Vivian] Craft battles? Really?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.770
You should've heard the drama
between this little boy and girl

04:30.853 --> 04:32.105
over glitter glue.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.690
They wound up with it in their hair.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.109
Michelle, just tell your students
that most long term relationships

04:36.192 --> 04:37.694
result from a mutual pursuit.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.946
Not glitter glue.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.160
Listen, I just got to the office
and I've got a lot of work to do today.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.038
You work too much, you know that?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.541
I mean, you need to take time
and enjoy life.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.293
When's the last time you went on a date?

04:53.876 --> 04:55.378
OK, I really got to go.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.672
I'll talk to you later. Love you. Bye.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.173
Love you.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.267
Hey, guys.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.894
It took me all night, but I think I solved

05:11.978 --> 05:13.354
the data streaming problem.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.023
-Ha-ha-ha!
-Way to go, Viv!

05:17.317 --> 05:18.401
Purfect!

05:18.484 --> 05:19.944
[Justine] Why don't you leave
that picture there,

05:20.028 --> 05:22.196
rather than bring it back and forth
every day.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.615
I wouldn't want Liz to be left
alone overnight.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.159
It's a picture!

05:26.242 --> 05:28.077
Oh, come on.
Give him a break will you.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.500
[Justine] Ugh!

05:34.751 --> 05:36.919
No matches again!

05:37.003 --> 05:39.464
Justine! My Perfect Match
isn't even live yet.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.924
-There's no one to match to.
-I know.

05:42.008 --> 05:46.012
It's just a big fat zero is another
reminder of my lonely, pathetic life.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.263
Well, maybe you should get a cat.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.264
Yes!

05:48.931 --> 05:50.308
I don't want a cat!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.185
I want to meet a man.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.936
A good man!

05:54.020 --> 05:55.396
Sure, I've met a lot of men.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.314
Sometimes more than once!

05:56.397 --> 05:57.690
But a good one...

05:57.774 --> 05:59.317
You know what I'm talking about.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.111
Vivian is concentrating
on her career right now.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.905
She solved the data streaming problem!

06:03.988 --> 06:05.114
Thanks, George.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.493
That's just as fulfilling
as a relationship.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.453
Are you kidding me?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.080
You two need to get out there!

06:12.330 --> 06:14.540
You need to grab some hot bull
by the horns

06:14.624 --> 06:15.833
and just hold on for dear life

06:15.917 --> 06:17.710
and hope that he's not secretly married!

06:17.794 --> 06:19.420
And you need to grab...

06:19.504 --> 06:21.089
a cow by the horns?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.048
That sounds weird.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.050
Yeah, I should.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.052
I mean, I can be spontaneous!

06:26.135 --> 06:28.304
Except for Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.182
That's when I take Liz to the vet
for her diabetes medication.

06:31.265 --> 06:35.353
Guys, dating isn't about spontaneity
or how hot somebody is.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.563
Relationships that are based
on physical attraction

06:37.647 --> 06:40.024
don't result in longevity or marriage!

06:40.233 --> 06:41.109
Oh.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.944
It's, it's about compatibility!

06:43.486 --> 06:45.196
That's why our dating algorithm,

06:45.279 --> 06:46.823
will be better than anything else!

06:47.198 --> 06:49.242
There's all this stress about dating!

06:49.325 --> 06:50.701
What to wear?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.161
Should I shave my legs?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.329
Of course.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.580
Who pays the bill?

06:55.373 --> 06:57.792
All that for someone
that you're never going to see again.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.670
Yeah! Or they don't call you back
because you're "too aggressive"!

07:01.420 --> 07:03.965
-Yeah, or they give you a fake number.
-[Vivian] See?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.176
My Perfect Match takes care
of all the stress

07:07.260 --> 07:09.762
by letting a computer
find a soulmate for you!

07:11.472 --> 07:12.807
[office chatter]

07:26.529 --> 07:29.740
Now that is what I call a Perfect Match!

07:31.033 --> 07:32.118
Really?

07:41.878 --> 07:44.589
-Good morning, Mr. Robinson.
-Adele!

07:44.672 --> 07:46.215
Tell me what's good!

07:46.299 --> 07:49.093
Well, you're late for the first
quarter development meeting.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.387
Let's push that to this afternoon.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.890
Too late! I already told them
to start without you.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.266
What?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.435
Well, you're not that important, anyway.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.146
Right, I'm just the CEO of the company.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.273
Oh! Really?

08:02.356 --> 08:03.858
I had no idea.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.902
Well maybe you should start
showing up to work on time!

08:06.569 --> 08:09.280
-Maybe I should hire another secretary.
-Good luck.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.991
We both know you'd never find anyone
prettier than me.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.244
Or one with so many, many years
of experience.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.663
[Adele] But somehow I just keep
getting prettier!

08:21.083 --> 08:22.001
You'll be pleased to hear

08:22.084 --> 08:24.795
that the programming department
has been very busy lately...

08:26.797 --> 08:28.174
Mr. Robinson.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.592
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.720
Please continue.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.015
Right! Of course. Um...

08:36.140 --> 08:38.768
As I was saying, we've been very busy

08:38.893 --> 08:41.770
and I am pleased with the results
of this quarter's roll out.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.899
We have some exciting new products
to show you

08:45.024 --> 08:47.068
that I think you're really going to like.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.861
Wonderful! Let's hear them.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.322
May I introduce...

08:52.698 --> 08:53.741
Fat Cat!

08:54.283 --> 08:57.828
It tracks and monitors
your cat's calorie intake.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.081
Fat...

09:00.748 --> 09:01.791
Cat?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.168
Yeah, for the cat lovers.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.505
No good?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.009
OK, um, OK!
You're going to love this one.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.596
It's called Coffee-Mometer!

09:16.055 --> 09:18.140
For the coffee connoisseur.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.726
It helps the user gage their perfect
drinking temperature.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.895
By simply inputting the start brew time

09:22.979 --> 09:25.273
along with the region
of where the beans come from.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.024
[Wes] Coffee-what?

09:27.608 --> 09:28.651
This sounds pretentious.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.946
-Can't people just use their finger?
-I... uh... I...

09:32.446 --> 09:33.781
What else have you got?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.575
What about...

09:37.743 --> 09:39.495
Movie Moody.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.915
It's really exciting!

09:42.999 --> 09:45.334
The user takes a selfie,

09:45.418 --> 09:46.961
and the app suggests a movie,

09:47.461 --> 09:49.171
that, ah...

09:49.589 --> 09:51.257
OK, I'm starting to see...

09:51.924 --> 09:54.719
the problem... It's, um...

09:55.052 --> 09:55.970
OK, um...

09:56.053 --> 09:58.222
This smart-tech has no potential
for revenue!

09:59.056 --> 10:02.268
Robinson Tech is dropping in the market,
and why?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.687
Because we've lost touch
with what the people want!

10:06.647 --> 10:08.024
We need to think bigger!

10:08.107 --> 10:09.358
What else have you got?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.862
Well, we have one more thing
in development

10:12.945 --> 10:16.157
and it, it's still in the--
the programming stage.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.284
What is it?

10:19.952 --> 10:23.289
It's an online dating algorithm.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.878
Perfect.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.301
-[messenger chimes]
-Vivian Blair?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.887
[Adele on speaker] Wes Robinson
needs you in the development meeting.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.972
He wants you to present My Perfect Match.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.017
Here's your chance, kid!

10:45.102 --> 10:47.313
Uh, thank you. I'll be right in.

10:50.566 --> 10:51.942
OK. OK. OK...

10:52.026 --> 10:53.110
I can do this.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.571
I can do this. I need my research!

10:55.655 --> 10:56.947
-Where's my research?
-Here!

10:57.281 --> 10:58.282
How do I look?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.201
I don't know what to say.
I've never done this before!

11:00.576 --> 11:01.410
Here!

11:01.911 --> 11:02.870
Deep breaths.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.205
You'll be fine.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.374
-Don't be nervous.
-[George] And just smile!

11:08.167 --> 11:09.126
Maybe don't smile.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.586
-No?
-[George] No.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.504
OK.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.507
-Go on. You've got this, girl!
-I got this!

11:15.216 --> 11:17.218
I got this! I got this.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.179
[Vivian screams]

11:20.388 --> 11:21.305
[Justine laughs]

11:29.814 --> 11:30.856
[exhales sharply]

11:38.906 --> 11:39.740
[whimpers]

11:40.366 --> 11:41.700
Vivian Blair, is it?

11:42.118 --> 11:43.035
Yes.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.453
Mr. Robinson.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.497
[Wes] I apologize for putting you
on the spot like this,

11:46.622 --> 11:49.125
but we're all dying to hear about
My Perfect Match.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.960
Sir, I'm more than happy to present
My Perfect Match--

11:51.168 --> 11:53.170
-Derek!
-Yeah, I'm just--

11:53.254 --> 11:55.381
Derek, this is Vivian's project,

11:55.464 --> 11:56.882
I'd like to hear it from her, please.

12:01.804 --> 12:02.805
[softly] Thank you.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.975
Go on. Impress me.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.060
I dare you.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.314
[nervous exhale]

12:14.150 --> 12:15.109
Well...

12:15.693 --> 12:20.072
My Perfect Match...
is online dating with a twist.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.533
Instead of swiping left or right,

12:22.616 --> 12:25.077
based on whether you think
you will match with what you see...

12:28.456 --> 12:29.457
Uh...

12:34.920 --> 12:37.131
Um... [clearing throat] My research shows

12:37.214 --> 12:39.550
that most relationships
that result in marriage

12:39.633 --> 12:41.260
are based on compatibility,

12:41.343 --> 12:45.473
rather than physical attraction
or say... passion.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.391
Really?

12:47.516 --> 12:49.310
[Vivian] Scientifically speaking, yes.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.314
It's all in the research,
if you'll just turn to page three.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.984
You're talking about
taking the passion out of dating?

12:57.985 --> 12:59.904
That sounds almost as boring as Fat Cat.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.947
[laughter]

13:04.158 --> 13:07.244
No, I'm talking about putting
compatibility first.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.500
People say "love is blind," but has
anyone really put that to the test?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.043
Huh?

13:14.418 --> 13:16.420
I'm saying, no photos.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.630
No measurements.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.132
My Perfect Match takes
your digital footprint

13:20.216 --> 13:21.467
and runs the algorithm.

13:21.592 --> 13:25.221
And then it determines the mathematical
likelihood of love between two people.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.182
It's revolutionary, really.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.312
See this is what I'm talking about!

13:33.938 --> 13:34.772
She's right.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.608
There are millions of people online

13:37.691 --> 13:39.818
that are crazy enough to do anything
to find love.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.153
Crazy?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.614
No, I, I've been working on this research
for months.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.865
It's not crazy.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.659
My Perfect Match will work!

13:46.909 --> 13:48.494
I don't care if it works or not.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.539
With the right marketing,
people will buy it...

13:52.122 --> 13:55.167
and the best time
to attract desperate daters is now.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.002
Before Valentine's Day!

13:58.504 --> 13:59.630
Valentine's Day--

13:59.880 --> 14:00.839
Can I just--

14:00.923 --> 14:03.217
Derek, pull all your people off
whatever they're doing.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.302
I want everyone at Robinson Tech

14:05.386 --> 14:08.389
focusing all their energy
on launching My Perfect Match

14:08.472 --> 14:10.307
-for this Valentine's Day.
-Of course, Mr. Robinson.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.517
Can I just...

14:12.142 --> 14:13.102
Thank you, Vivian.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.730
I think it's going to be revolutionary
working with you.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.361
[laughs]

14:22.653 --> 14:24.572
If you'll excuse me, I'm just going to...

14:36.083 --> 14:37.167
Vivian!

14:37.626 --> 14:38.836
Long time, no see.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.464
-Mr. Robinson.
-[Wes] Please, call me Wes.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.177
I would just like some clarification.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.472
If you don't think My Perfect Match
will actually work,

14:50.556 --> 14:52.433
why are you insisting on launching it?

14:52.558 --> 14:55.519
Don't you have a moral obligation
to believe in the products you put out?

14:57.605 --> 14:58.772
Professionally speaking.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.443
Look, I don't have to believe
in something personally

15:02.860 --> 15:04.987
to trust that it has monetary potential.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.741
Like all the people online
that are looking to find love,

15:08.991 --> 15:11.452
they'll just spend a bunch of money
and move on.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.037
That's all I really care about.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.623
Well, that's cynical!

15:17.333 --> 15:19.752
Nothing lasts forever,
especially not love.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.339
But with your product,

15:23.422 --> 15:26.467
Robinson Tech can get in
on the online dating game

15:26.550 --> 15:27.885
and get out with some capital.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.971
There's a golf app I think has potential.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.182
Golf?

15:33.432 --> 15:34.808
People love golf!

15:36.018 --> 15:39.396
Besides, you don't find love
with numbers and statistics.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.275
You walk up to a woman in a bar,

15:43.567 --> 15:46.528
you buy her a drink and you tell her...

15:48.113 --> 15:49.531
"You're the most beautiful woman
in the room."

15:51.784 --> 15:53.369
That's what women want to hear, anyway.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.747
Not the score of their
digital compatibility!

15:57.164 --> 15:59.291
I have spent months on this research.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.460
It's scientifically proven!

16:01.752 --> 16:05.047
There's nothing better than that
to base a relationship on.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.049
My money's still on passion.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.718
[sighs] Well...

16:09.802 --> 16:12.262
I can tell we're not going to agree on
pretty much anything.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.724
Thank you for your time, Mr. Robinson.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.434
Wes.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.773
If you'll excuse me,
I now have a lot of work to do...

16:22.856 --> 16:23.983
apparently.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.654
What did I say?

16:29.405 --> 16:32.241
Well, for someone who is constantly
surrounded by women,

16:32.324 --> 16:34.868
you really seem to know very little
about them.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.539
And also, Ben is here to see you.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.625
Yo! Big brother!

16:41.792 --> 16:43.335
-Now what?
-Ouch!

16:43.752 --> 16:45.713
Is that any way to treat a man who has
been slaving away

16:45.796 --> 16:47.047
all day on the tennis courts?

16:47.798 --> 16:49.508
You know, thanks to my back swing,
I just secured

16:49.591 --> 16:51.218
an investment with the Austrians.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.971
Ben Robinson, One. Wes Robinson, Zero.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.141
You act like we are in some kind
of competition.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.060
We are all invested in this company, Ben.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.478
Come on, lighten up!

17:01.645 --> 17:03.981
-[Ben] What's the deal?
-[Wes] Sorry.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.817
I'm suddenly in a bit of a bad mood.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.484
Yeah, so I've heard.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.945
Adele texted me already,
saying Robinson Tech is pushing

17:11.030 --> 17:12.448
an online dating app?

17:12.531 --> 17:13.824
That's not like you.

17:13.906 --> 17:14.782
Adele!

17:14.907 --> 17:16.660
What? He's a Robinson too!

17:18.829 --> 17:22.374
Actually, it's a dating algorithm.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.710
OK, whatever.
An online dating algorithm.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.545
It's a risky move.
Mom's not going to like this.

17:26.627 --> 17:27.713
You leave mom to me.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.050
I know there's a lot of competition out
there but this one's different.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.054
I trust you, but you're still gonna
need a major marketing boost.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.972
That's why I made a quick phone call.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.476
-What are you doing tomorrow morning?
-Why?

17:41.226 --> 17:43.020
Because you're going to appear on
Hello Morning.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.063
You didn't.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.981
Aren't I just the best brother ever?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.357
Ben Robinson, Two.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.776
Wes Robinson, still zero.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.653
A live TV interview!

17:52.446 --> 17:54.323
Ben, I don't even know
how this algorithm works yet.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.241
How could I possibly
sell it to the masses?

17:56.408 --> 17:58.660
Invite that pretty developer lady
with you.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.579
Adele already told me all about her too.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.122
Oh, she did, did she?

18:03.415 --> 18:04.792
[Ben] Wes, relax!

18:04.875 --> 18:07.377
I've still got your back,
as long as you've still got mine.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.005
You'll be at rehearsal
on Saturday night, right, Best man?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.257
-Huh? Huh?
-Of course. Of course.

18:13.634 --> 18:14.760
Now will you get out of here, already?

18:14.843 --> 18:15.761
You have a wedding to plan,

18:15.844 --> 18:17.846
and I suddenly have a lot
of begging to do.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.931
Later.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.689
-What do you think?
-I think that looks great.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.732
Yeah?

18:30.359 --> 18:31.360
[door slams]

18:35.114 --> 18:36.115
[exhales sharply]

18:37.616 --> 18:38.784
[fast typing]

18:42.287 --> 18:44.123
What happened in there?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.459
[phone chimes]

18:47.793 --> 18:48.794
Yes?

18:48.877 --> 18:51.296
[Adele on speaker] Wes Robinson would
like to see you in his office.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.756
Again.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.299
[phone chirps]

19:00.973 --> 19:02.850
Uh, I think it went well?

19:03.934 --> 19:04.893
Yeah.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.577
You know you could walk over
to my desk like a normal person,

19:21.660 --> 19:23.328
instead of having your assistant page me.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.913
Well that would mean I'd
have to fire Adele

19:24.997 --> 19:25.914
and she wouldn't like that.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.334
-Try it, see what happens.
-See?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.753
And she's the only one who knows
how to work the photocopier.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.338
What do you want?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.465
I want you, actually.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.304
Ah... I don't know... What do you mean?

19:40.929 --> 19:43.932
I want you to be with me
on Hello Morning tomorrow

19:44.016 --> 19:45.517
to promote My Perfect Match.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.936
The TV show?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.522
No way.

19:50.939 --> 19:54.443
All I'm asking is for you to stand
beside me for five minutes on the show.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.862
Yeah... I don't think so.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.573
Come on. I can't do it without you.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.742
Let me handle this.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.829
Look, I get it.

20:06.079 --> 20:09.124
Spending even one more moment
with that man

20:09.208 --> 20:11.710
is almost as appealing as a root canal.

20:11.835 --> 20:12.669
Yeah.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.129
You know I can hear you.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.214
But look at it this way.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.843
Being on TV is great publicity
for Perfect Match.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.262
And you want it to be a success, right?

20:24.264 --> 20:26.808
[sighs] OK. I'll do it.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.603
For My Perfect Match.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.729
[Wes] Thank you.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.149
You're welcome.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.863
I cannot wait to see what the world thinks

20:39.947 --> 20:42.157
of the two of you promoting love
on live TV.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.083
[sighs]

20:51.291 --> 20:52.584
Well, it's official.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.462
I've got nothing to wear
to the Hello Morning taping tomorrow.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.215
Why do I own so much beige?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.759
Viv, what has gotten into you?

21:01.301 --> 21:02.594
It's my boss, Wes Robinson!

21:02.678 --> 21:04.221
He's always like, "Call me Wes."

21:04.304 --> 21:06.473
It just gets under my skin!

21:06.556 --> 21:08.100
You know, for a guy who runs
a tech company,

21:08.183 --> 21:09.226
he wouldn't know a good idea

21:09.309 --> 21:11.228
if hit him in his giant, egotistical head!

21:11.603 --> 21:13.563
Ah, sounds cute.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.899
Wes Robinson is not cute!

21:16.441 --> 21:17.901
Devilishly handsome?

21:19.194 --> 21:20.821
OK, OK!

21:20.904 --> 21:22.447
Look, I'm just joking!

21:22.906 --> 21:24.199
Jeez, Viv!

21:24.491 --> 21:26.576
I haven't seen you this riled up
in forever.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.580
Look, you need to be more realistic.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.832
OK. Men are men!

21:32.040 --> 21:33.792
It's like they have two brain cells.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.877
One to watch any sport with a ball in it,

21:35.961 --> 21:39.423
and the other to somehow know the lyrics
to every Bruce Springsteen song.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.633
Anything more is a bonus.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.929
And not every man is Dad.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.349
You need to start giving them a chance.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.146
What do you think he'd think of us now,
if he hadn't left?

21:56.732 --> 21:57.774
Hmm.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.568
Who knows!

21:59.901 --> 22:01.278
It's been so long.

22:02.946 --> 22:06.241
But, you know, I bet he would
probably say...

22:06.450 --> 22:08.952
"Wow! Look at Vivian!"

22:09.036 --> 22:10.746
She's grown up to be
the smartest woman in the world,

22:10.996 --> 22:13.165
and Michelle has somehow managed to be

22:13.290 --> 22:15.500
an amazing wife and a fabulous teacher.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.712
It's true, I really am an awesome wife.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.255
[chuckles]

22:20.589 --> 22:21.923
Well, speaking of awesome,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.843
I think I found the perfect outfit
for tomorrow.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.762
Tada!

22:27.429 --> 22:28.680

22:28.764 --> 22:30.182
Is that what I think it is?

22:30.682 --> 22:33.894
-[Vivian] Yeah. "Uh"?
-Uh... I mean...

22:34.936 --> 22:37.898
That's a really nice dress, Viv.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.942
-I like the pink.
-Uh-huh.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.820
-And the lace.
-Yeah?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.447
[Riley] Very Lady Diana.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.365
Upper crust.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.785
You're my favorite brother-in-law.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.287
-I'm your only brother-in-law.
-[Michelle laughs]

22:52.913 --> 22:55.082
[whispers] She's really not going
to wear that, right?

22:55.248 --> 22:57.709
Hey, if it was good enough
for my prom date, it's good enough for--

22:57.793 --> 22:58.960
Ted Reynolds.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.128
Vivian Blair.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.589
So you're the genius that
invented My Perfect Match!

23:03.006 --> 23:05.050
I didn't know genius could
be so beautiful.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.135
Oh, I don't know about that.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.013
I appreciate you having us on the show
on such short notice, Ted.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.390
It's no problem at all, Wes,
your brother's an old friend.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.975
And to be honest with you,
I owe him a few favors

23:14.059 --> 23:16.019
after a couple of unlucky
poker matches recently.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.188
-The guy's a shark!
-Well, that is Ben.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.147
[both men laugh]

23:19.231 --> 23:21.191
He's always been better at making friends
than I have.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.693
But, I appreciate you extending
the courtesy to me.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.487
It's no problem at all.
We'll see you guys on set.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.530
You're going to do great!

23:28.907 --> 23:29.991
[Vivian exhales]

23:30.492 --> 23:32.661
Is it just me or is it getting
really hot in here?

23:34.079 --> 23:35.330
It's probably the lights.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.083
-Are you OK?
-Huh?

23:39.417 --> 23:40.919
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.171
A little too late for that.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.548
[inhales deeply]

23:45.215 --> 23:46.716
Nope, I'm fine.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.720
This is... good. I want it.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.390
Oh, hi, there.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.600
Camera one.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.228
Let's go.

24:03.441 --> 24:06.027
[man] Back live. Three, two, one...

24:06.653 --> 24:09.197
We're back again this morning
with more updates on fashion week.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.533
But first, are you looking for a new way
to find love?

24:11.658 --> 24:14.202
We have Vivian Blair and Wes Robinson
of Robinson Tech,

24:14.286 --> 24:16.705
to talk to us more about
a new online dating algorithm.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.915
Vivian, tell us all about
My Perfect Match.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.542
Thank you, Ted.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.377
Well, our programmers have developed
an algorithm

24:22.460 --> 24:25.297
to determine your love match
based on your digital footprint.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.424
My digital footprint is a size 12.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.092
[laughs]

24:30.468 --> 24:33.597
The algorithm knows you
better than you know yourself

24:33.680 --> 24:35.891
and it is designed to
not only find you a date,

24:35.974 --> 24:37.559
but the perfect partner.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.769
Hopefully, it's the last
first date you'll ever have.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.813
That sounds like something
my mother would love.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.441
And I understand the app
is available today, locally.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.775
-That's right.
-Yes.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.569
So anyone can download it after the show?

24:48.195 --> 24:50.739
And we're working on
a wider international release.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.992
Single man to single man...

24:54.075 --> 24:55.202
What do you think, Wes?

24:56.244 --> 24:57.495
I think Vivian is right.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.956
My Perfect Match
could find anyone true love.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.584
Anyone! Even you?

25:02.834 --> 25:03.919
Sure.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.838
So, you would consider
using it yourselves?

25:07.547 --> 25:09.132
Of course we would.

25:11.843 --> 25:15.764
Well, we're actually quite busy
with the launch--

25:15.847 --> 25:17.849
And we at Robinson Tech,

25:17.933 --> 25:19.684
stand behind the quality
of all of our products.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.688
If My Perfect Match can't find Vivian
and I true love, nothing will.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.816
Well, we have to have you
back on the show for a follow up.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.069
Let's say... Valentine's Day?

25:29.444 --> 25:30.904
And don't forget to bring
your perfect matches,

25:31.029 --> 25:32.197
I'd love to meet them.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.407
[laughs] So would I.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.492
Fantastic!

25:35.575 --> 25:37.118
Our audience is gonna love this.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.620
Keep your eyes on these two daters.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.413
Robinson Tech is on the market!

25:40.914 --> 25:42.332
-[whispers] What are you doing?
-[whispers] I had to!

25:42.415 --> 25:44.251
We'll catch up with CEO Wes Robinson

25:44.334 --> 25:45.585
and programmer Vivian Blair,

25:45.669 --> 25:46.836
to see if love is in the air.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.012
What were you thinking,
putting me on the spot like that?

25:56.137 --> 25:57.514
What was I supposed to say?

25:57.597 --> 25:59.015
We were on the show to promote!

25:59.099 --> 26:02.060
Literally, anything but committing me
to having my dating life

26:02.143 --> 26:03.311
broadcast on television.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.106
You said yourself My Perfect Match
works, right?

26:06.606 --> 26:07.816
So you should have no problem using it.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.402
Of course I wouldn't have a problem
finding my match

26:10.485 --> 26:11.945
because I'm not an egomaniac!

26:12.153 --> 26:13.655
I'm sure there's not
a single women out there

26:13.738 --> 26:15.615
that would possibly want
to spend a life with you.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.741
[mumbles] Let alone breathe the same air.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.494
-What was that?
-Hm?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.872
Look, I haven't heard
any complaints before.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.625
But, then again with the women I meet,

26:25.709 --> 26:27.419
we don't generally do much talking.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.753
Really?

26:28.837 --> 26:31.214
They don't tend to share their theories
on astrophysics?

26:32.841 --> 26:34.092
You're just jealous.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.303
I could find true love if I wanted to.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.554
But I don't want to.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.848
Hey, it's not just me that is
riding on the success of this product.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.391
This is your company!

26:43.518 --> 26:45.395
You know what, you're right.

26:45.478 --> 26:46.479
Challenge accepted.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.482
I guess we'll see
who finds their perfect match.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.775
I guess we will.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.485
-Fine!
-Fine!

26:57.032 --> 26:58.241
I like her!

27:07.876 --> 27:09.377
Are you OK, Viv?

27:10.337 --> 27:12.380
We saw what happened on TV.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.508
-You looked great!
-Yeah, yeah.

27:15.592 --> 27:18.595
You couldn't even tell
how pissed off you were.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.013
The software is now live.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.265
-Everything's running smoothly.
-Good!

27:22.349 --> 27:24.601
Because the first profile on there
is going to be mine!

27:25.685 --> 27:26.770
Yes!

27:26.853 --> 27:29.230
This is what we've been training for!

27:29.481 --> 27:30.774
-OK!
-All right!

27:30.899 --> 27:32.609
OK, let's do it!

27:32.942 --> 27:35.403
-On! [giggles]
-Oh, it looks great, it looks great!

27:35.987 --> 27:38.365
OK. What is your social password?

Here, let me.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.579
Where was this selfie taken?

27:45.872 --> 27:46.873
I don't know.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.167
I thinks it's your summer home.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.960
How do you not know that?

27:51.211 --> 27:53.838
Adele, I pay you to know things
like that for me!

27:54.672 --> 27:57.384
-Sunset or sunrise?
-Sunset.

-Ah, chocolate!

Uh-uh.

Have you ever been in love?

28:24.327 --> 28:25.328
Hmm.

28:27.455 --> 28:31.376
Maybe what Oksana and I had was love.

She was Ukrainian super model
and she didn't speak English.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.301
Haven't you ever heard that love
is its own language?

for the algorithm

how mine would look.

-Well, you did great.
-Yeah?

determine your profile name.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.563
Nice try.

33:43.646 --> 33:45.773
But not even you could get me down
right now.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.817
I'm sure the men that have
been selected for me

33:47.900 --> 33:50.153
by my team's excellent programming,

33:50.236 --> 33:52.488
are absolutely perfect.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.866
Oh, I'm sure they are very special.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.661
In fact, I'm going to message...

33:59.203 --> 34:00.955
Mr. Valentine right now

34:01.039 --> 34:02.123
and see if he wants to meet tonight.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.334
[whisper] Mr. Valentine.
[laughs] Well, Good luck.

34:06.627 --> 34:09.714
And where will you take
your perfect match?

34:11.507 --> 34:13.259
Somewhere romantic.

34:13.634 --> 34:16.512
Quiet. Where I can really get to know him.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.062
[slurps wine]

34:28.107 --> 34:29.317
[sighs]

34:31.069 --> 34:32.445
You look really pretty tonight.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.114
I didn't think you'd be so pretty!

34:36.491 --> 34:38.951
Not that you're not pretty!

34:39.034 --> 34:40.369
Not that I didn't
expect you to be pretty,

34:40.453 --> 34:42.705
I just think you're pretty.

34:43.371 --> 34:44.748
Sorry, did I already say that?

34:44.916 --> 34:46.626
Yeah, a few times.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.128
-Sorry.
-Oh no, no don't be sorry.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.505
[both laughs nervously]

34:50.670 --> 34:52.130
Thank you for the compliment.

34:52.715 --> 34:53.757
You're welcome.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.886
You look great, too.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.055
I like your shirt.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.599
Oh, this?

35:01.849 --> 35:04.352
I'm glad you like it.
I probably tried on about 20 of them.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.895
[laughs]

35:08.439 --> 35:10.066
Just to be honest, Viv,

35:10.149 --> 35:11.192
I haven't been on a date in awhile.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.485
So I'm a little nervous.

35:14.612 --> 35:15.613
Me too.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.119
So... we have a lot in common.

35:21.869 --> 35:22.954
We do!

35:23.329 --> 35:25.748
-We are both career driven.
-Mm-hmm.

35:25.873 --> 35:28.292
-We're both from small families.
-Mm-hmm.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.546
We both prefer the fall over the summ--

35:33.339 --> 35:34.757
[sneezes]

35:36.759 --> 35:38.010
Are you OK?

35:38.511 --> 35:40.930
[sneezing continues]

35:44.308 --> 35:45.601
Sorry.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.938
[snorts] I think it's my allergies.

35:49.438 --> 35:51.190
Sorry, what were you saying again?

35:51.399 --> 35:55.319
Ugh... Um, we both have
traditional values!

35:56.487 --> 35:57.697
Garçon.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.451
I'm allergic to these flowers.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.662
[waiter] Oh, my. I am so sorry.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.832
Do you want me to remove them for you?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.042
[waiter] I could take them away
from the table.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.085
You should probably just...

36:11.169 --> 36:12.670
-[whispers] take them away.
-[waiter] No problem.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.046
Thank you.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.509
-[Mr. Valentine sighs]
-As you were saying?

36:20.887 --> 36:22.346
It's almost like we were...

36:24.348 --> 36:25.933
M-A-D-E...

36:26.851 --> 36:28.811
made for each other!

36:31.230 --> 36:33.816
Yeah! We are technically very compatible!

36:33.900 --> 36:34.984
Hmm.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.652
I'm sorry.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.779
I didn't ask you what you do
for a living?

36:39.906 --> 36:40.865
Lizards.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.244
Lizards?

36:45.745 --> 36:47.163
Mm-hmm.

36:48.122 --> 36:52.627
Like, you sell them? In a pet store?

36:53.377 --> 36:54.629
I show them.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.005
In competition.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.676
I have this iguana that would just...

37:03.054 --> 37:04.555
take your breath away.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.723
I bet!

37:11.103 --> 37:13.397
Um, the chicken, how did you like it?

37:13.773 --> 37:16.359
Um, the chicken was very good.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.318
See!

37:17.401 --> 37:19.278
Look at us being compatible again!

37:19.654 --> 37:20.905
I liked it too.

37:20.988 --> 37:23.491
Yeah, at first I thought
it was a little weird

37:23.574 --> 37:25.785
that you ordered exactly what I ordered.

37:25.868 --> 37:27.119
But, hey...

37:27.453 --> 37:30.790
Viv, I just want to share
everything with you.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.459
Mr. and Miss Valentine!

37:33.918 --> 37:34.961
Hmm.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.047
I still can't believe it!

37:39.298 --> 37:42.802
Yeah, I literally can't believe it either!

37:48.266 --> 37:50.851
Dessert! Let's have dessert!
Garçon!

37:50.935 --> 37:52.937
-[claps] Garçon.
-No, it's, no no, no, no.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.314
It's fine. Thank you.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.068
Thank you. It's OK.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.405
You're watching your figure?

38:02.905 --> 38:06.492
Vivee, now that we've found each other,
you can totally let yourself go.

38:07.868 --> 38:10.079
A bit. It's perfectly natural.

38:10.329 --> 38:11.622
Honestly, it's fine.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.166
How considerate.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.087
You know, with this whole
career driven thing,

38:18.170 --> 38:19.922
I actually have an early morning tomorrow,

38:20.006 --> 38:21.173
so I should probably wrap this up.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.759
When can I see you again?

38:26.470 --> 38:27.680
I'll call you.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.890
See? I knew you were going to say that!

38:30.599 --> 38:34.687
It's like we share the same B-R-I-A-N.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.230
Brain.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.608
The waiter's over there.
You should probably grab the bill.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.610
You know, be a gentleman?

38:42.903 --> 38:43.988
Garçon!

38:52.455 --> 38:53.831
You got to be kidding me!

38:54.582 --> 38:55.499
There...

38:55.583 --> 38:58.461
-There you are.
-[Marty] How's the date going?

38:59.837 --> 39:01.964
Well, a lady never tells.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.799
It's going great, actually!

39:03.966 --> 39:05.468
I think it's the pheromones.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.637
Did you know that lizards emit pheromones
to other lizards,

39:08.763 --> 39:11.057
while they are trying to attract a mate.

39:11.307 --> 39:14.185
Oh! Just leave me alone,
you crazy lizard guy!

39:15.936 --> 39:17.146
[Vivian squeals]

39:19.732 --> 39:21.317
-[Vivian] Stay away from me!
-[Mr. Valentine] Wait...

39:21.400 --> 39:23.319
Stay away from me!

39:25.905 --> 39:27.281
[laughs]

39:27.365 --> 39:28.866
-[Mr. Valentine] Come back.
-[Vivian] No.

39:28.949 --> 39:29.909
Put that down.

39:29.992 --> 39:33.204
I thought you were allergic to roses!

39:33.621 --> 39:35.289
[laughs]

39:35.456 --> 39:37.375
-See, you do love me.
-No. No, I don't.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.420
Wes, come on.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.588
This is for the wedding.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.595
What do you think of off white or taupe?

39:50.388 --> 39:51.806
Um...

39:52.306 --> 39:53.891
They look exactly the same.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.644
What are you doing picking
the napkins for, anyway?

39:57.103 --> 39:59.105
Elaine trusts my impeccable taste.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.648
[Judith] No, no, no, darling.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.275
She trusts my impeccable taste.

40:03.734 --> 40:04.777
Hello, Mother.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.529
Well, hello, Wes.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.824
You know, I had to let myself in.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.659
Are you avoiding me?

40:11.992 --> 40:15.162
No, just busy being a cog
in the Robinson Wheel.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.288
Really?

40:16.414 --> 40:18.666
I mean, what is this
I am seeing all over the news,

40:18.749 --> 40:21.210
something called My Perfect Match?

40:22.795 --> 40:24.130
It's just a new venture.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.715
You have nothing to worry about.

40:27.049 --> 40:28.467
Nothing to worry about?

40:28.592 --> 40:31.804
Wes, that was not exactly
a glowing review.

40:31.887 --> 40:34.056
Hey, any publicity is good publicity.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.850
[Judith scoffs] Hardly.

40:36.434 --> 40:41.021
Now, I still control the majority
voting shares in this company,

40:41.105 --> 40:43.649
and I vote apps are on the way out.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.402
It's not an app, it's an algorithm.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.988
I have no intention of doing that.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.824
People just want to find
that special someone.

40:52.324 --> 40:55.911
Look, I know it's still early,
but we've got the research behind us.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.246
Really?

40:58.038 --> 41:01.083
So just who is this woman
named Vivian Blair?

41:02.626 --> 41:04.462
Just a woman from the company.

41:04.628 --> 41:07.715
Oh, Wes, please.
I know you way too well for that.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.177
Now I'm just concerned
that you're doing this all on a whim

41:11.260 --> 41:13.345
to impress some pretty girl, all right.

41:13.679 --> 41:17.725
Business is all about logic
and thinking with your brain.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.562
Can you imagine what this company
would look like right now

41:21.645 --> 41:25.733
if your father had just followed
every one of his romantic notions?

41:26.525 --> 41:28.152
I'm the result of one of those notions.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.279
It's not like that.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.909
Vivian's driven. Smart.

41:35.701 --> 41:38.037
In fact she wants
nothing to do with Wes.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.414
-That's how smart she is.
-[Judith] Oh, well that's fabulous.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.166
Let's just keep it that way, all right?

41:42.249 --> 41:44.627
I want you focused on the numbers.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.586
Trust me.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.088
I'm focused on all the right things.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.675
So nope for the taupe?

41:51.926 --> 41:54.094
-[Wes chuckles]
-No, no.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.892
Ugh. So embarrassing!

42:00.351 --> 42:02.520
Oh, come on, it wasn't that bad.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.981
Michelle, not only was that the worst date
I have ever been on in my entire life,

42:06.065 --> 42:08.234
it was plastered across the evening news.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.946
OK, OK. It was, it was pretty bad.

42:12.279 --> 42:13.864
But, at least you looked good.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.574
I mean that outfit looked fabulous on you

42:15.658 --> 42:17.493
as you were running away from lizard guy.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.788
[laughs]

42:20.996 --> 42:24.124
Michelle, stop laughing!

42:24.917 --> 42:26.544
OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:26.627 --> 42:27.670
I'll stop.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.005
How am I supposed to face
Wes Robinson tomorrow?

42:30.089 --> 42:32.299
He's going to have a field day
rubbing this in.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.802
Why do you care so much about his
opinion, anyway?

42:34.927 --> 42:36.637
I mean, the algorithm is a success.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.680
You should be proud.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.723
Yeah. I guess so.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.767
Oh, OK.

42:41.850 --> 42:42.810
I get it.

42:43.227 --> 42:46.730
You're not going to think it's a success
until you snag your own hot shot guy.

42:47.022 --> 42:48.399
What? No.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.025
Wait, is that wrong?

42:50.150 --> 42:53.445
I just want Wes to know
that I was right all along, OK.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.949
Are you trying to make him jealous?

42:57.116 --> 43:00.286
I don't want to make him jealous,
I just want to win a little bet.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.788
Uh-huh. Sure.

43:03.789 --> 43:07.668
Look, I think that competition
has no place in the dating world,

43:08.252 --> 43:10.129
but if you're looking
for your perfect match

43:10.212 --> 43:11.880
then I suggest you keep looking,

43:11.964 --> 43:14.508
because Mr. Valentine
was definitely not it.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.261
[sigh] OK.

43:20.055 --> 43:21.724
Back on the dating horse.

I can't. I've got a lot of work to do.

45:18.090 --> 45:19.716
I'm still young. I can learn new tricks.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.178
Listen, I just have a question
about the report.

45:23.762 --> 45:24.972
What's this figure here?

45:25.180 --> 45:26.306
Oh, that's the projections.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.641
It's what we think
the download numbers will be

45:27.724 --> 45:29.768
after the Valentine's Day roll out.

45:31.061 --> 45:32.438
-Those are big numbers.
-Mm-hmm.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.649
OK. Thanks.

45:36.316 --> 45:39.945
Um, actually,
I've been wanting to ask you.

45:42.197 --> 45:46.118
How do you feel about making
My Perfect Match

45:46.827 --> 45:49.329
free on Valentine's Day?

45:50.414 --> 45:53.208
But isn't that when we're set to do
the most downloads?

45:53.834 --> 45:56.044
Robinson Tech would be losing out
on a lot of revenue.

45:56.128 --> 45:59.465
Yes, but on a larger scale,
the more we get people to talk about it,

45:59.548 --> 46:01.758
the more potential revenue it could gain.

46:02.342 --> 46:04.720
It's the best advertisement of all.

46:06.221 --> 46:07.389
We could even go global.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.808
Here, take a look at this.

46:14.521 --> 46:16.482
I charted the potential numbers

46:16.565 --> 46:19.485
and I think if we increase
the users by 10%,

46:19.568 --> 46:23.155
we can increase the overall downloads
by 25% in 30 days.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.700
-That's impressive.
-Yeah.

46:26.825 --> 46:29.745
Vivian, this might just be
almost as popular as you.

46:31.955 --> 46:33.207
I've seen you on TV a lot lately.

46:33.290 --> 46:35.876
Oh. OK, here we go.

46:36.418 --> 46:38.212
Come on, you can laugh at me.

46:38.337 --> 46:40.631
Are you kidding? It's great publicity.

46:41.006 --> 46:43.467
And it's also a little fun
to watch you squirm.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.052
Oh, really?

46:45.177 --> 46:47.930
And how do you know one of those guys
isn't my perfect match?

46:48.639 --> 46:50.641
You don't like any of them. I can tell.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.976
And how do you know that?

46:53.393 --> 46:55.229
Because when you don't like something

46:55.312 --> 46:56.897
you wrinkle your nose up like this.

46:57.189 --> 46:58.690
-[sniffs]
-See?

46:58.899 --> 47:01.193
I know, because you do it every time
you see me.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.570
-Mr. Robinson.
-Wes.

47:06.114 --> 47:07.115
Wes.

47:08.367 --> 47:10.744
It's not that I don't like you.

47:10.869 --> 47:13.997
It's just everything you stand for.

47:14.540 --> 47:15.874
Oh, much better.

47:16.124 --> 47:18.752
You know. The fancy cars and the money,

47:18.877 --> 47:22.589
and the revolving door of beauty queens.

47:22.881 --> 47:24.216
It's just not real.

47:25.217 --> 47:28.971
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
But that's not really me.

47:29.888 --> 47:30.889
You'll see.

47:32.933 --> 47:34.977
[cellphone rings]

47:35.936 --> 47:37.521
Is that one of your perfect matches?

47:38.021 --> 47:39.147
I wish.

47:40.482 --> 47:41.567
It's just my mother.

47:41.650 --> 47:42.526
Again.

47:42.609 --> 47:43.735
I'll call her back.

47:46.738 --> 47:49.283
Once again Vivian, thank you
for all your hard work.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.535
You're a real asset to the company.

47:52.536 --> 47:54.621
Delivery for Vivian Blair.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.917
And I see I'm not the only one
that values you.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.502
-Thank you.
-There you go.

48:01.295 --> 48:02.379
Ugh.

48:02.546 --> 48:04.131
This isn't the real me, either.

48:05.173 --> 48:06.091
Uck!

48:06.842 --> 48:08.635
It must of cost the guy a small fortune.

48:08.969 --> 48:11.346
I know. I hate red roses.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.348
I thought every woman loved roses?

48:14.474 --> 48:15.726
Well, I'm not every woman.

48:16.977 --> 48:18.395
You certainly are not.

48:24.776 --> 48:28.572
My Dad left when I was a kid.

48:30.782 --> 48:34.745
He told us he was going
to get my Mom some roses,

48:34.828 --> 48:35.996
but he never came back.

48:37.497 --> 48:39.791
I haven't liked the sight of them since.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.086
Sounds familiar.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.673
My Dad didn't exactly stick around either.

48:49.426 --> 48:50.886
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

48:51.136 --> 48:52.638
Oh! Don't worry about it.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.058
You did get something right, though.

48:56.141 --> 48:57.351
-I did?
-Uh-hmm.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.396
I didn't like any of them,

49:01.730 --> 49:03.774
-my matches.
-I knew it!

49:05.025 --> 49:06.568
I did! I knew it.
Who was the worst?

49:06.652 --> 49:07.736
Was it yoga guy?

49:07.819 --> 49:10.781
I just don't like men that wear
tighter shorts than I do.

49:10.864 --> 49:13.867
I know, you should leave a little
something to the imagination.

49:14.618 --> 49:15.952
Everyone likes a bit of mystery.

49:16.662 --> 49:17.746
I should have seen it coming,

49:17.829 --> 49:20.165
because his user name was Twisted Mister.

49:20.290 --> 49:22.834
[laughter]

49:28.382 --> 49:30.092
Are you staying late again tonight?

49:32.594 --> 49:35.764
How about, instead of chocolate cake,
I order us some take out?

49:36.014 --> 49:37.015
Your choice.

49:41.978 --> 49:43.397
I can't.

49:43.647 --> 49:46.024
I actually have another date tonight.

49:49.361 --> 49:50.404
OK.

49:51.029 --> 49:52.155
Another time, then.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.116
Yeah.

49:56.284 --> 49:59.162
-Well, back to work.
-OK, OK!

49:59.287 --> 50:00.914
This company doesn't run itself, you know.

50:00.997 --> 50:02.708
Thanks... Wes.

50:05.919 --> 50:07.129
[sighs]

50:28.442 --> 50:31.486
Hi. I'll have my usual. Thanks.

50:37.784 --> 50:40.245
Hi, Wes! How's it going?

50:40.996 --> 50:42.581
-The usual?
-Yes, please.

50:42.664 --> 50:44.791
-Wes.
-Vivian!

50:46.126 --> 50:47.169
Where's your date?

50:48.545 --> 50:50.422
Don't tell me he stood you up.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.218
His loss, my gain.

50:55.427 --> 50:58.263
I'm sure "DJ Dan" will be here any minute.

50:58.597 --> 51:00.557
-DJ Dan!
-DJ Dan.

51:00.640 --> 51:01.767
OK.

51:05.228 --> 51:08.023
Now do you believe me, that love
is about more than just compatibility?

51:10.942 --> 51:15.530
To tell you the truth,
I would be OK if he was a no show.

51:16.823 --> 51:20.702
I'm getting a little tired
of all this "compatibility."

51:22.829 --> 51:24.164
It's called chemistry.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.795
Well, it's easy for someone
like you to say,

51:30.420 --> 51:33.089
someone who oozes charm
out of their pores.

51:33.381 --> 51:35.091
But chemistry does not equal love!

51:36.176 --> 51:39.346
First of all, I don't
want to "ooze" anything,

51:40.263 --> 51:41.890
and you don't know anything about me.

51:41.973 --> 51:43.850
I know the bartender knows your name.

51:45.393 --> 51:48.605
You're probably here every night
of the week, picking up a new girl.

51:49.606 --> 51:51.775
And what do you know
about compatibility, huh?

51:52.567 --> 51:56.154
Well, unlike you, I don't need
My Perfect Match to make me a match.

51:57.405 --> 51:58.448
I'll do it right now.

51:59.407 --> 52:00.575
Watch and learn.

52:05.455 --> 52:06.414
Bingo!

52:10.544 --> 52:11.503
Hi.

52:13.088 --> 52:14.005
I don't normally do this,

52:14.089 --> 52:16.299
but I couldn't help but notice
how beautiful you are.

52:17.676 --> 52:18.802
Can I buy you a drink?

52:19.469 --> 52:22.389
Wow! Wes Robinson of Robinson Tech.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.142
Well? Is she your perfect match?

52:27.310 --> 52:29.145
She certainly is perfect, isn't she?

52:29.980 --> 52:31.773
You two are a beautiful couple.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.817
-I'm sure you'll be very happy together.
-Come on. Let's go.

52:34.025 --> 52:35.819
[Marty] Hey, it's a free country, man.

52:36.236 --> 52:37.904
Come on, out you go. Out.

52:38.405 --> 52:39.865
[bouncer] And don't come back.

52:45.745 --> 52:48.498
And I walked right up to the woman
at the bar and I bought her a drink.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.835
You should have seen the look
on Vivian's face, though.

52:51.918 --> 52:53.503
So, did you take her home?

52:53.628 --> 52:54.880
Who? Vivian?

52:54.963 --> 52:56.298
No! The other girl.

52:56.423 --> 52:57.757
No, of course not!

52:57.883 --> 52:59.509
I only bought her a drink
to make Vivian mad.

52:59.634 --> 53:00.927
Yeah, good luck with that.

53:02.721 --> 53:04.097
What are you talking about?

53:04.472 --> 53:05.765
Whatever you're trying to pull

53:05.891 --> 53:08.018
is not gonna work
on a woman like Vivian Blair.

53:08.101 --> 53:09.769
She sees right through you, big brother.

53:09.978 --> 53:12.022
Now can you pay attention?
This is kind of my wedding.

53:12.689 --> 53:14.774
-Wedding rehearsal.
-Same thing.

53:17.193 --> 53:19.362
Here comes the bride!

53:21.573 --> 53:22.782
Perfect.

53:23.825 --> 53:26.286
Now, Ben, you can take your bride's hand

53:26.369 --> 53:28.663
and then I'll ask for the rings, please.

53:29.581 --> 53:30.582
Thank you.

53:30.999 --> 53:32.000
You'll say your vows

53:32.083 --> 53:34.336
and then at the end
I'll pronounce you man and wife,

53:34.419 --> 53:36.338
and then you can go on
to your happily ever after.

53:36.922 --> 53:38.340
It's as simple as that.

53:41.301 --> 53:42.260
[exhales]

53:43.303 --> 53:44.804
Are you about to cry?

53:44.888 --> 53:46.765
Of course not.
This is a wedding rehearsal.

53:48.141 --> 53:49.351
Same thing.

53:51.269 --> 53:53.563
[cellphone rings]

53:56.024 --> 53:57.651
I'm sure she's calling for you.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.071
Hey, Mom.

54:01.279 --> 54:02.364
Where are you?

54:02.572 --> 54:03.823
Negotiating.

54:04.741 --> 54:07.410
Look, it's not like
I'm missing the wedding, OK.

54:07.535 --> 54:10.580
It's just a rehearsal, and you know
I don't do well with boring.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.165
Put your brother on.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.125
Well, enjoy your closing, Mom.

54:14.209 --> 54:17.003
Elaine and I can't wait
to share our special day with you.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.046
See you soon.

54:18.838 --> 54:20.090
Tag. You're it.

54:20.882 --> 54:22.258
Who wants some champagne?

54:26.096 --> 54:27.138
Hello, Mother.

54:27.389 --> 54:28.431
Weston.

54:29.057 --> 54:32.644
You have made your old mother
a very happy woman.

54:32.978 --> 54:35.730
Shares of Robinson Corporation
are just shooting through the roof.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.273
And it's all thanks to you.

54:38.358 --> 54:39.275
Thank you, Mother.

54:39.401 --> 54:41.027
And all you had to do was trust me.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.070
You should try it more often.

54:43.446 --> 54:45.365
So, how's the rehearsal?

54:47.534 --> 54:49.619
Good. They look happy.

54:50.203 --> 54:51.579
Oh, well, of course they do.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.499
Everyone always looks happy
on their wedding day.

54:54.582 --> 54:55.709
I know I did.

54:56.292 --> 54:58.253
But don't let that fool you.

54:58.670 --> 55:00.213
Love doesn't pay the bills.

55:00.338 --> 55:01.965
Oh, you mushball.

55:02.048 --> 55:06.011
[laughs] Well, you and I are cut
from the same cloth, honey.

55:06.136 --> 55:08.596
You know, cynicism runs in this family.

55:09.431 --> 55:10.390
Does it?

55:11.224 --> 55:13.059
So, who are you taking to the wedding?

55:14.227 --> 55:15.437
No one.

55:16.104 --> 55:18.106
Wes, come on, you have to take someone.

55:18.732 --> 55:19.816
There's no one.

55:19.899 --> 55:21.443
All right. Don't pout.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.946
Your brother's the emotional one, not you.

55:25.739 --> 55:28.366
Look, she doesn't have
to be Miss Right, OK,

55:28.450 --> 55:32.078
she just has to be Miss Right
for the photographers and the networking.

55:32.495 --> 55:36.833
I think I have invited at least five CEOs
from Fortune 500 companies to this thing.

55:37.250 --> 55:38.752
Oh, sounds like a lot of fun.

55:39.002 --> 55:42.088
Well, Robinson Corporation
is a family-owned company

55:42.172 --> 55:45.592
and that means even a family wedding
becomes a corporate event.

55:46.593 --> 55:48.553
I should know, I'm writing the checks.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.223
The place is going to be overrun
with photographers.

55:53.767 --> 55:55.435
The day isn't about business, Mom.

55:55.935 --> 55:57.353
It's about Ben and Elaine.

55:57.937 --> 56:00.482
Ben is marrying a school teacher, Wes.

56:01.024 --> 56:04.778
I'm sure her family is very happy
that someone is worrying about the bills.

56:05.612 --> 56:07.697
Sure, yeah, happy...

56:08.448 --> 56:12.535
Look, I turned over a multi-million dollar
company to you.

56:13.036 --> 56:15.413
When are you going to start
focusing on growth.

56:15.872 --> 56:19.334
Um, how successful is successful?

56:19.667 --> 56:24.005
Every generation should
build on the Empire, not crumble it.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.550
Excuse me Mother, I have to go.

56:28.051 --> 56:29.677
I have a toast to make.

56:45.276 --> 56:47.654
-[Wes] Big night last night?
-Hmm? What?

56:48.404 --> 56:49.823
Oh, um...

56:50.657 --> 56:53.201
I'm so sorry. I must have fallen asleep.

56:55.662 --> 56:57.205
Can I see you in my office, please?

56:57.413 --> 57:00.083
Uh-huh, yup. Yes. Thank you.

57:07.173 --> 57:08.466
Why didn't you wake me up?

57:09.008 --> 57:10.635
You just looked so peaceful.

57:10.718 --> 57:12.512
Like a little, drooling angel.

57:12.637 --> 57:13.471
[laughs]

57:13.680 --> 57:15.849
That's not, that is not funny!

57:21.604 --> 57:22.939
This is going to seem...

57:23.064 --> 57:25.400
No. No. Will you...

57:26.151 --> 57:27.485
Vivian's here.

57:31.948 --> 57:33.491
[to himself] Act casual, act casual.

57:34.075 --> 57:35.785
I surrender, OK?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.245
You were right and I was wrong.

57:37.328 --> 57:39.831
And I'll clearly never find
a soulmate on My Perfect Match,

57:39.914 --> 57:43.293
because I am now convinced
of what I knew all along.

57:44.586 --> 57:45.420
What's that?

57:45.879 --> 57:47.338
I'm undateable.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.383
-I don't know about that.
-It's true.

57:50.717 --> 57:53.136
I'll never find someone that I love more
than my job.

57:53.344 --> 57:57.056
In fact, I'll never go on another date
again for the rest of my life.

57:58.683 --> 57:59.726
Vivian.

57:59.934 --> 58:01.519
I need you to go on another date.

58:04.814 --> 58:05.773
With me.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.027
I'm sorry, say that again?

58:09.110 --> 58:11.362
Relax. It's not a real date.

58:11.946 --> 58:14.949
I just need you to sit beside me
at my brother's wedding this Saturday.

58:15.742 --> 58:16.826
Do you have plans?

58:17.160 --> 58:19.787
-No, but we're launching--
-Please.

58:20.246 --> 58:22.040
This is really important to my family

58:22.123 --> 58:25.543
and I'm pretty sure there's not
a single woman in my contact list

58:25.627 --> 58:27.003
that wouldn't throw a drink in my face,

58:27.086 --> 58:28.338
if given the opportunity.

58:30.423 --> 58:32.091
I definitely believe that.

58:32.926 --> 58:35.261
Besides, why chose an amateur

58:35.345 --> 58:38.223
when you can have the dating
expert herself?

58:39.057 --> 58:41.726
Hmm. What about that girl from the bar?

58:43.061 --> 58:44.354
I changed my mind.

58:44.646 --> 58:46.481
She wasn't the most beautiful woman
in the room.

58:46.940 --> 58:48.274
Oh, really?

58:48.525 --> 58:50.360
They must just grow from trees, then.

58:52.487 --> 58:54.572
I had my eye on someone else, but...

58:55.657 --> 58:57.450
she left before I could tell her.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.077
Well, you know what they say,

58:59.160 --> 59:02.080
there are plenty of vapid 25-year-old
women in the sea.

59:04.832 --> 59:06.000
Pretty please?

59:06.918 --> 59:08.211
What do you say?

59:09.087 --> 59:10.255
I can't, Wes.

59:11.464 --> 59:13.341
Not because I have plans.

59:14.259 --> 59:15.802
But, they need me here.

59:17.428 --> 59:18.888
I need you.

59:21.307 --> 59:23.268
This wedding is important
for the company, too.

59:26.437 --> 59:29.857
He says it's a work thing.
You could ask for major overtime.

59:30.608 --> 59:32.986
-Adele! Don't you have work to do?
-I am working.

59:33.069 --> 59:34.279
I am your assistant,

59:34.362 --> 59:36.864
and I'm assisting you
getting a date for the wedding.

59:38.449 --> 59:39.867
You know, she's onto something.

59:41.703 --> 59:42.870
OK.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.081
I'll go with you
to your brother's wedding.

59:45.999 --> 59:47.083
Great.

59:47.959 --> 59:50.211
But if I do, I want a raise.

59:50.962 --> 59:52.422
You know how hard I've worked.

59:52.630 --> 59:53.881
I've earned it.

59:54.799 --> 59:56.301
And I want Derek's job.

59:57.510 --> 59:59.429
-A tough negotiator.
-Uh-huh.

59:59.887 --> 01:00:01.264
I like that.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.558
Deal.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:04.976
Deal.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.063
[computer chimes]

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.399
Derek, my office please.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:20.950
Derek, you're fired.

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:22.744
Yeah, I figured.

01:00:23.077 --> 01:00:25.121
Your days were numbered after Fat Cat.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:28.374
Yeah, this always happens.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.292
[chuckles]

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:35.048
Can't wait to see you all dressed up!

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:37.925
[nervous] Yay...

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.011
[laughs]

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.681
It is perfect.

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:46.934
-You are going to sweep Wes off his feet.
-Justine, it's just for work.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.353
Are you kidding me?

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:49.937
I have been watching you two for weeks.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:52.315
You can cut the romantic tension
with a spoon.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.443
Can I come?
Can I come? Can I come?

01:00:55.943 --> 01:00:56.986
I need you here.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.112
I know.

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:01.366
-I always miss all the fun stuff.
-[Vivian giggles]

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:02.867
-Thank you.
-Bye!

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:06.496
-You look great.
-Aw, thanks.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:09.624
Adele.

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:14.295
-I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:23.638
Hi. Thanks for coming.

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:26.474
Wow, you look nice.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.601
Thank you.

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:30.895
You should have seen the
price tag for "nice."

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:32.480
It was worth every penny.

01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:35.525
Show you to your seat?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:48.788
Thanks for doing this.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.873
You are officially employee of the month.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.083
Ooh, a trophy.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.835
I'm not just in it for the glory,
you know.

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:54.919
Of course.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.838
Now if you need me, I'll be up there

01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:58.005
next to the guy getting married.

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.674
Oh, the one with the tux, right?

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:00.717
Yeah.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.385
Kind of looks like me but better looking.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.303
[laughs]

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:05.471
Good luck.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.647
Be upstanding, please.

01:02:16.482 --> 01:02:18.109
[wedding music begins]

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.595
[music fades]

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:50.224
We are gathered here today to celebrate
one of life's greatest moments.

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:54.395
The joining of two hearts, Ben and Elaine.

01:02:55.396 --> 01:02:59.817
Together you have decided to embark
on the same path, hand-in-hand.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.278
To commit to one another

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.531
and love one another more fully each day.

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.743
And I understand the bride
and the bridegroom

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:10.328
have written their own vows.

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:15.625
Come on Ben,
don't keep your beautiful bride waiting.

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:20.963
Elaine.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.133
You are my best friend.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:29.388
And I promise to love you
and cherish you for the rest of my life.

01:03:30.097 --> 01:03:33.226
And I will never grow tired of you,
even when I get old and tired.

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:36.562
And I'll let you buy as many throw pillows
as you want,

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.481
even though I think we have way too many.

01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:39.607
[Elaine giggles]

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.526
That dress... Wow!

01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:45.446
Even if you were wearing a paper bag
right now,

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.532
with that smile, you'd still be

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:49.492
the most beautiful bride
I've ever laid my eyes on.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.539
You're all I need,
you're all I have ever needed

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:59.043
and I can't wait to spend the rest
of my life proving how much I love you.

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:03.172
[exhales]

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.594
[cellphone rings]

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:12.765
George!

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:14.433
Calling with good news, I hope.

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:17.103
Unfortunately not, Mr. Robinson.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.564
It's, um, it's My Perfect Match.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.399
What happened?

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:23.234
[George] It isn't making its projections.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.945
Downloads are way down.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:28.573
By what margin?

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:30.992
A lot, sir.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.702
We're not getting
anywhere near the numbers

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:34.495
that we'd predicted
for the Valentine's Day roll out,

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.164
and new subscribers are at a standstill.

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.166
It's not looking good.

01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:43.754
Thanks for calling, George.
I appreciate it.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.965
Do you want me to call Vivian
and tell her?

01:04:48.342 --> 01:04:49.635
[Wes] No. I'll...

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.179
I'll tell her.

01:04:57.768 --> 01:04:58.936
-Hi Vivian.
-[gasps]

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.106
It's nice to see you.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.649
You look well.

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:05.902
[coughs]

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:07.737
Listen, elephant in the room,

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.574
but I have a girlfriend now
and she's really jealous,

01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:13.576
so it would be great if, uh,

01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:15.578
-she didn't know about us.
-Mm-hmm.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.204
I appreciate--

01:05:19.373 --> 01:05:20.917
Coming, my little green iguana.

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:22.543
You'll find someone.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:29.759
Wes.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.346
What's wrong?

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.139
Nothing.

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:39.018
Are you... hungry?

01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:41.687
Because I just walked past the kitchen,

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.398
and the prime rib is looking top notch!

01:05:44.523 --> 01:05:46.192
That sounds amazing. I'm starving.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:47.526
All right. Come on.

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:50.696
[wedding emcee] Next toast, Mr. Robinson.

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:53.282
[applause]

01:05:57.703 --> 01:05:59.914
Now, I'll keep this short.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.084
As I'm sure you're all aware,

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.754
Ben was the one in the family
that got all the charisma.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.006
That's why he's head of Marketing
for the company,

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.300
and I'm pretty sure that's how

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.052
he convinced a woman like Elaine
to marry him.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.471
[guests chuckles]

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.099
Ben's not just my brother,

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:19.558
he's also my best friend.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.269
We used to compete a lot
when we were kids.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.231
I usually won, of course.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:26.399
[more chuckles]

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.567
I was president of the student council.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:31.988
Quarterback of the junior football team
in high school.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.533
And I had the biggest yo-yo collection.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:40.204
But, I've never been more
envious of anyone

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.540
than I am of you today, Ben.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.166
I'm throwing in the towel.

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:47.378
You've surpassed me in every single way.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.715
I only hope that one day that I too

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.676
can find the same love
that you share with Elaine.

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:57.596
That's all I've ever really wanted.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.269
-To Ben and Elaine.
-[guests] To Ben and Elaine.

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:05.021
May they always be as happy
as they are today.

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:10.818
And make sure you drink up this champagne,
because it was flown in from France

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:11.736
and we can't return it.

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:13.279
[applause]

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.709
[party chatter]

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.713
[cellphone rings]

01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:38.179
Hello, Mother.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.222
Wes, I've got to talk to you.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.307
[Wes] Where are you?

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.184
How are you missing Ben's wedding?

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:45.186
I am not missing Ben's wedding,

01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:47.354
I'm, just, fashionably late.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.941
Besides, it's his second wedding,
it's almost like watching a rerun.

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:52.860
Look, I have to go.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.362
Can this wait till later?

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.406
[Judith] No. No, it cannot wait.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.533
I just got a very important call
from the office.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.704
My Perfect Match is tanking.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.333
And after the company
spent millions on marketing.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:09.627
I believed in it.

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:12.671
Wes, are you out of your mind?

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:15.674
I mean, you can't just believe in things!

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:20.054
Robinson Tech is a business,
it is not a fairy tale.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.848
You've got to get your
head out of the clouds, Wes,

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.810
and use that expensive education you have.

01:08:26.393 --> 01:08:27.685
Oh, where should I start?

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:31.232
Well, you might start by
not taking your employees to weddings.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:34.234
Pictures are already starting
to pop up all over the internet.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:37.113
Seriously Wes, it's just embarrassing.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:38.988
I'm sorry, Mother.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.658
I thought you'd be used to me
disappointing you by now.

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:43.577
Wes...

01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:54.296
-Is everything OK?
-Yeah.

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:58.175
You wanna, get some air.

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:02.095
Hey, hey, hey, seriously though...

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.640
what's wrong?

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.100
What happened over there?

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:12.106
Wes, you're not acting like yourself.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.774
Is that such a bad thing?

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:18.028
OK, now you're making me nervous.

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:21.740
What's going on?

01:09:23.742 --> 01:09:25.202
Is it My Perfect Match?

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:29.747
Can you just say something?

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:39.300
Whoa.

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:41.886
That was not part of the job description.

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:44.138
Was it wrong?

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:45.848
Yes!

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.560
-Why?
-Because you're my boss.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.690
Because you're chocolate cake.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:58.277
You look really good
but you're really bad for me.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.239
I thought you liked chocolate cake?

01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:05.576
You really do.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:24.595
Do you want to get out of here?

01:10:33.854 --> 01:10:34.980
Ben, where's your brother?

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.191
Mom, are you seriously just getting here?

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.485
What? Well, honey, look.

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:40.903
I sat through your first wedding.

01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:43.155
I'm sure this one was equally as touching.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:44.615
Now where's Wes?

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.325
You're not going to like this.

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:47.785
He left with Vivian.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.204
I can't believe he's doing this.

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:51.664
I can't believe he didn't do it sooner.

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.958
He's walking out on his own
brother's wedding!

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:55.501
-[man] Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
-Oh, Wilson, hello!

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:56.502
No, Mom.

01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:59.922
He's finally letting his guard down
and opening his heart.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:02.174
Maybe it's time you do the same.

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:06.804
Life is more than just spreadsheets, Mom.

01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:14.103

[rain pouring outside]

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.674
I can't believe this is really happening.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.844
You couldn't stand to be in the same
room as me a couple of weeks ago.

01:11:48.053 --> 01:11:50.597
I'm willing to admit that I might
have been wrong.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:52.349
Might have?

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.938
You know, you might have to kiss me
a few more times while I think about it.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:09.408
Do you want to come in for coffee?

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:20.169
What is it?

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.217
My Perfect Match is tanking, Vivian.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:32.765
This was supposed to be the biggest day
of the release but it's not.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.436
Statistically speaking,
it's all down hill from here.

01:12:40.105 --> 01:12:42.107
When did you find out about this?

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:44.526
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:48.072
-I didn't want to ruin your night.
-My night?

01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:50.574
-This is my career.
-I know.

01:12:50.657 --> 01:12:52.618
-I didn't tell you because...
-Because you're a coward.

01:12:54.995 --> 01:12:56.580
You run away from everything.

01:12:56.663 --> 01:12:58.957
That's why you don't pick up the phone
when your mother calls.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.918
That's why you don't have a girlfriend.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.006
I bet you didn't even upload
your profile onto My Perfect Match!

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.521
I fell for the Wes Robinson act, didn't I?

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.112
Vivian, wait!

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:31.824
It wasn't an act with you.

01:13:32.699 --> 01:13:34.535
Is that what you tell the other girls?

01:13:35.327 --> 01:13:36.787
Do they fall for that too?

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.707
You know, I might be cynical about love,
but you...

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.543
You won't even try.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.920
You won't even take a chance.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:22.541
Aw, honey.

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.720
I can't believe it's all over.

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:36.513
This isn't fair.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.308
Viv should have been the next face
of Silicone valley.

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:40.726
Yeah.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:46.982
What's he doing here?

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:26.104
I knew you would end up back here.

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:29.983
I just didn't know it would take you
so long to screw up with Vivian.

01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:31.276
What are you doing here?

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:34.613
Saving you from yourself,
what do you think?

01:15:36.156 --> 01:15:38.325
I don't feel like talking
right now, Adele.

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:40.827
Well, that's good!

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:43.121
Because I plan on doing most of it.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.214
What has gotten into you, Wes?

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.093
Why is it I can't go anywhere
without a woman yelling at me?

01:15:57.344 --> 01:15:59.888
Because we seem
to hold you to a higher standard

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.348
than you hold yourself.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:04.977
Do you remember when
you were a school boy?

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:07.938
I do.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.023
I was your mother's assistant back then

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:13.527
and you used to love
coming into this office.

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:15.612
When your Mom was in a meeting,

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:18.407
you'd sit right there and staple
all my schedules together

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.076
and drive me nuts, just like you do now.

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:26.498
But I wish you could have
seen the smile on your face,

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.751
the way I saw your smile.

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:35.173
You hoped more than anything

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.883
that if you worked hard enough,

01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:39.845
one day this whole place would be yours.

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:43.890
I remember your crazy jackets.

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.976
Those shoulder pads! [laughs]

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.021
It was the 80s.

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:51.273
Now leave me alone, I'm not done.

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:56.695
Over the years your mother spoiled you.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.281
I warned her.

01:16:59.823 --> 01:17:02.326
You were handed everything you wanted

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:06.121
and I stopped seeing that special smile
on your face.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.670
Until I saw you look at Vivian.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:18.091
And after all these years,

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:23.180
I knew there was something you wanted
so much again.

01:17:23.847 --> 01:17:26.475
Something you knew would not be
handed to you.

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:29.353
Something you knew you would
have to work for.

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:32.689
There was only one problem.

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.818
She saw right through the act.

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:40.489
Then drop the act.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.241
It doesn't look good on you, anyway.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.542
Come on, a girl like Vivian Blair
doesn't come along every day.

01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:55.754
Do you really want to give up
just like that?

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.223

We didn't hear anything about a
plan to get Vivian back. I swear.

Yeah but we're totally going to
help with that plan to get her back.

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:39.955
I granted access
to all my social media accounts,

01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:42.874
and I didn't just answer
all the questions,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.210
I answered them honestly.

01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:48.004
What's going on?

01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:52.550
My plan was to go on dates
with real women,

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:55.261
not just the ones who fall for my
cheesy pick up lines.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:59.641
Lots of horrible dates,
and then tell you about them.

01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:02.268
So you could see the real me.

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:08.942
Then I hoped that eventually you'd see
that we are compatible.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.571
But my plan failed before it even began.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.699
What are you talking about?

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:18.868
Check your profile.

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.430
I have a new match.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:43.560
Wes.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.437
The real me.

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:48.732
Look at those two.

01:23:48.982 --> 01:23:50.191
Oh.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.526
Way to go, Viv!

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.695
Is that really her boss?

01:23:53.778 --> 01:23:54.779
Yeah.

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:58.158
Wow, that is some kind of handsome.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.869
Your boss is female, right?

01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:04.164
Oh, yeah. And not handsome.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.417
-Yeah, just checking.
-[laughs]

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:10.128
You're my perfect match, Vivian.

01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:13.256
And the only reason
you couldn't find yours

01:24:13.339 --> 01:24:15.800
was because he was too afraid to sign up.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.387
So the algorithm
says that we're compatible,

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:21.014
but that doesn't mean that we're--

01:24:21.097 --> 01:24:23.224
You would like it if I brought you
flowers on our first date.

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:25.101
But never red roses.

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:27.645
If I brought you red roses,

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.398
you'd do that thing that you just did,

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:31.566
where you scrunch your nose up,

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:34.360
like this, when you don't like something.

01:24:36.362 --> 01:24:38.239
If I had a chance to cook you dinner,

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:40.158
I'd make you chocolate cake.

01:24:40.658 --> 01:24:43.078
Always chocolate cake.
No matter what time of day.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:47.332
Your ideal date would be somewhere
quiet and romantic,

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:51.086
where it just seems like you and me.

01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:55.048
When you're nervous
you brush your hair behind your ear.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:57.217
I must have seen you do it a dozen times.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:00.845
But you're not doing it right now.

01:25:01.971 --> 01:25:03.431
And that gives me hope...

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:06.643
Because Vivian,

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.357
I love you.

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:16.861
[chuckles]

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:19.197
Wow. Are you getting this?

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:22.992
I just have one more question.

01:25:25.036 --> 01:25:26.955
Will you spend Valentine's Day with me?

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:40.343
Only if I can pay!

01:25:40.718 --> 01:25:42.220
[Vivian laughs]

01:25:52.772 --> 01:25:54.023
They kissed!

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:57.277
Oh! I have to call her.

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.904
But, she's on TV.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.447
I'll leave a voicemail.

01:26:02.073 --> 01:26:03.116
[Ted] There you have it.

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:04.826
Vivian Blair and Wes Robinson.

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:06.870
You couldn't find a more perfect match!

01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:10.665
[jazz music playing]

01:26:24.095 --> 01:26:25.138
George!

01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:27.390
I never knew you had it in you.

01:26:27.473 --> 01:26:28.516
Justine...

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.394
I want you to meet Liz, my cat.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:35.356
I would be so honored. [giggles]

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:40.570
Hi, Viv, we're watching you right now,

01:26:40.653 --> 01:26:42.322
and it looks like you found
your someone nice

01:26:42.405 --> 01:26:43.781
just in time for Valentine's Day.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.700
Whoo! I'm so happy!

01:26:45.783 --> 01:26:47.076
OK, call me later.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.244
Bye.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:50.580
[cellphone chimes]

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.209
Whoa. No, no. Look. Look.

01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.504
Viv, You're never going to believe this.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:01.216
Justine, at this point,
I will believe anything.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.718
The servers are blowing up.

01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:05.803
My Perfect Match downloads
are going through the roof.

01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:07.222
It's all because of you guys.

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.474
We've got so much work to do.

01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:10.558
OK!

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:12.518
[Ted] I don't know about you guys,

01:27:12.602 --> 01:27:14.270
but this next segment on celebrity diets

01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:15.605
is going to be super lame.

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:17.857
But you know what? I don't care.

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:19.400
Happy Valentine's Day everybody!

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.694
Happy Valentine's Day, baby.

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:24.322
-I love you.
-I love you too.

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:29.327
Good job, guys.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.541
How did you know I would say yes?

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:39.087
I didn't. But I've spent too much
of my life being a coward,

01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:41.547
and I had to prove that we're compatible.

01:27:41.881 --> 01:27:43.925
Ah. And what about passion?

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:46.719
We'll always have passion.
