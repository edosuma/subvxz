[instrumental music]

00:04.656 --> 00:06.093
This is fun, huh?

00:06.180 --> 00:08.530
Dinner and a movie
with my hubby.

00:08.617 --> 00:09.618
Might even let you
get a little bit

00:09.705 --> 00:12.186
in the backseat of the car.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.231
Well, we could skip the movie,
pull over and do it

00:14.318 --> 00:16.494
under the L Tracks,
then split the Kit-Kat bar

00:16.581 --> 00:17.669
I got in my glove box.

00:17.756 --> 00:20.150
No, come on, I dressed up fancy.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.065
I want to go to a nice
restaurant with good food

00:22.152 --> 00:25.895
not one with
a playground or a mascot.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.593
Boy, you are really tying
my hands here, lady.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.943
[cell phone rings]

00:31.031 --> 00:33.120
Oh, it's my mom again.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.904
Probably another
imaginary prowler

00:34.991 --> 00:36.862
rooting through her
underwear drawer.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.690
She actually believes
somebody would do that?

00:38.777 --> 00:41.998
People look away when they see
it hanging on her clothesline.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.608
- Tell her we're busy.
- You tell her.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.001
I don't wanna talk to her.

00:45.088 --> 00:49.005
- I already pushed answer.
- Damn it.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.268
Oh, yourmom.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.314
Hey, Peggy.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.532
What?

00:54.619 --> 00:56.404
Really?

00:56.491 --> 00:58.754
A raccoon is
loose in the attic.

00:58.841 --> 01:01.452
That's impossible, I put
chicken wire over the chimney

01:01.539 --> 01:03.715
when she thought the possums
were stealing her jewelry.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.369
Hang on.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.241
It's on the way,
let's just stop by

01:07.328 --> 01:09.069
or she'll bug us through
the whole movie.

01:09.156 --> 01:11.636
Fine, this better not come out
of my backseat time.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.943
Suggest you step on it.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.988
Okay, Peggy, we're on our way.

01:17.816 --> 01:21.168
I...hope you don't die
before we get there too.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.913
Psh. Took him long enough.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.567
If I told him
the house was on fire

01:29.654 --> 01:33.441
he'd probably stop for
marshmallows and a stick.

01:33.528 --> 01:37.706
Prepare to meet your maker,
you ring-tailed bastard!

01:37.793 --> 01:40.317
Bark a couple of times,
help me sell this.

01:41.666 --> 01:42.580
- Oh!
- Hey, mom.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.886
- Oh!
- Hey, Peggy.

01:43.973 --> 01:46.018
That raccoon's got us
all spooked.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.846
Pull out your
service revolver and turn

01:47.933 --> 01:51.372
that rodent's ass
into a Davy Crockett cap.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.287
How the heck could a
raccoon get in the house?

01:53.374 --> 01:54.810
A glass cutter
and a suction cup?

01:54.897 --> 01:57.987
What do you want
from me, Colombo?

01:58.074 --> 02:00.772
That possum wearing your pearls
would scare it away.

02:00.859 --> 02:03.601
I'll bet they're in cahoots,
one of them's eating my garbage

02:03.688 --> 02:06.648
while the other one's
watching me in the shower.

02:06.735 --> 02:10.391
It's like having your
own little fan club.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.523
Mike, just-just go upstairs
and scare it away.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.309
Be careful, those things
got razor sharp teeth

02:15.396 --> 02:16.658
and their spittle can
give you brain worms.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.181
Brain worms?

02:18.268 --> 02:20.575
They crawl inside your
medulla oblongata

02:20.662 --> 02:22.403
and the next thing you know,
you're sitting under a tree

02:22.490 --> 02:25.971
in your underwear
eating packing peanuts.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.538
Is that what happened
to the neighbor lady?

02:27.625 --> 02:29.540
Probably the same raccoon.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.325
Poor thing's a Looney Toon.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.370
For Halloween, she puts
a colander on her head

02:33.457 --> 02:36.765
and hands out little
travel shampoos.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.984
Just stomp around a little bit
so we can get out of here.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.944
I don't mind dying alone,
but I won't have them 'coons

02:42.031 --> 02:45.774
tearing the skin off my skull
like it's a taffy apple.

02:45.861 --> 02:48.385
I'm sure Mike'll scare it away.

02:48.472 --> 02:51.345
In the dark, his silhouette
has a very bear-like shape.

02:51.432 --> 02:55.131
Hm. So, where are you two
headed all gussied up?

02:55.218 --> 02:58.961
Is the Queen in town?

02:59.048 --> 03:01.224
No, we're just gonna grab a bite
and maybe catch a movie.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.400
Oh, la-dee-da.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.361
I can't get Mike to mow
my yard, but he's got time

03:07.448 --> 03:11.539
to trot you around town
like a show pony.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.584
We actually haven't been
out in quite a while.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.325
You know, we've both been
pretty busy with work

03:15.412 --> 03:16.370
and, you know, we're
trying to start a family..

03:16.457 --> 03:18.763
Right, right.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.896
Maybe I'll get to hold
the baby a couple of times

03:20.983 --> 03:24.682
before my arms get chewed
off by wild animals.

03:24.769 --> 03:27.598
Well, if that happens, we'll
just strap him to a BabyBjorn

03:27.685 --> 03:30.035
so you can still walk
around with him, okay?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.954
Alright, mom,
no raccoons on the premises

03:36.041 --> 03:40.089
but I did see some very
familiar faeces up there.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.091
Oh, why are you eyeballing Jim?

03:42.178 --> 03:44.006
He hasn't messed
in the house since he ate

03:44.093 --> 03:46.095
that half-pound bar
of baking chocolate.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.618
Oh, been there, done that.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.446
- You ready to..
- Yes.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.232
Oh, right, I forgot. You and
Madonna are going clubbing.

03:52.319 --> 03:55.060
We're actually going to see
the new Sandra Bullock movie.

03:55.147 --> 03:59.021
Oh, is that the one where she
turns out to be her own ghost?

03:59.108 --> 04:01.328
Thank you. I hate surprises.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.981
Does this mean
we can skip the movie?

04:03.068 --> 04:05.375
[Molly]
'No.'

04:05.462 --> 04:07.377
Would it have killed you
to at least bark

04:07.464 --> 04:09.553
a couple of times,
help build the drama?

04:38.669 --> 04:41.324
Perhaps, but would my voice have
been heard over the sounds

04:41.411 --> 04:45.197

and crunching bones?

to you about your mother.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.082
Oh, did she insult
you at my wedding?

06:27.169 --> 06:29.476
Because I had nothing to do
with the seating arrangements.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.521
Actually, I enjoyed
her company very much

06:31.608 --> 06:34.089

if she had any..

06:34.176 --> 06:36.134
...current entanglements.

06:36.221 --> 06:40.312
She's always feuding with the
Korean guy across the street.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.706
Nothing serious,
just a few racial slurs

06:42.793 --> 06:45.361
and an occasional turd
in the mailbox.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.670
So, no gentleman friend
to speak of?

06:49.757 --> 06:52.760
I don't think
she has any friends.

Hang on. I think I got

You know, I saw him dancing
with her at the wedding

10:49.779 --> 10:51.868
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.435
The women at church
wouldn't throw

10:53.522 --> 10:55.655
holy water on me
if I was on fire.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.963
You still have a
lot of life to live.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.138
Have you thought
about getting out there

11:01.225 --> 11:02.531
and maybe dating again?

11:02.618 --> 11:04.402
Oh, yeah,
I'll just leave a trail

11:04.489 --> 11:06.361
of breadcrumbs to my bloomers.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.542
What if I told you that I know
a nice, older gentleman

11:13.629 --> 11:16.240
who would very much like
to spend some time with you?

11:18.503 --> 11:21.593
If this is where you shove me
into a nursing home van

11:21.681 --> 11:24.292
you better have a rag
of ether and a lead pipe.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.948
[Jim barks]

11:32.126 --> 11:34.041
Just secure the bank
and seal off the area.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.608
I want choppers in the air
and a SWAT team on the ground.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.393
[knock on door]
Captain?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.569
Put snipers on the roof
of the surrounding buildings

11:40.656 --> 11:42.353
and if they get a clean shot,
tell 'em to take it.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.313
- I'll be standing by.
- Everything alright, sir?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.968
Eh, bank robbery in progress
near the Financial District.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.884
No fatalities, but he's holding
about a dozen people hostage.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.668
Wow, it's crazy out there.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.801
My partner and I just broke
up a pretty nasty turf war.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.324
- Gang-related?
- Hot dog vendors.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.502
Sort of a throw down
between the foot-long guy

12:00.589 --> 12:03.200
and the kosher guy.

12:03.287 --> 12:04.898
Uh-huh.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.421
So, you got some
good news for me?

12:06.508 --> 12:09.424
Yeah, they're gonna
share the spot.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.165
And, uh, we put
a soft pretzel guy

12:11.252 --> 12:13.863
in between 'em to act
as kind of a buffer.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.299
I was talking about
your mother, Biggs.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.215
- Did you speak to her?
- I did.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.566
Here's her number and she told
me to tell you, and I quote

12:21.653 --> 12:24.178
"If you're looking for an easy
spread, buy some Miracle Whip."

12:27.268 --> 12:29.400
Damn, I love a woman with
some pepper in her jack.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.185
Thanks for making this happen.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.448
And I'm assuming whatever goes
on between the two of you

12:33.535 --> 12:35.276
won't affect me or my
livelihood in any way.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.799
Of course not.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.976
This was just you doing
a favor for a friend.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.673
A friend?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.067
I'm friends with a lot
of people in a lot of places

12:44.154 --> 12:46.766
and I can certainly
be a friend to you.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.594
Well, one can't have
too many friends, sir.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.728
Oh, speaking of which,
the, uh, mayor gave me

12:52.815 --> 12:57.298
his courtside seats to the Bulls
and I can't use 'em.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.779
Courtside?
I've never sat courtside before.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.564
You play your cards right,
Biggs, you might see bars

13:02.651 --> 13:05.785
on that shirt
instead of barbecue sauce.

13:08.439 --> 13:09.701
Actually curried mustard.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.705
The frankfurter turf war
got kind of messy.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.707
I better go take
a bite out of crime, sir.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.017
- How'd it go?
- I gave him my mom's number.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.672
And he gave me two courtside
tickets to the Bulls game.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.109
Courtside?

13:26.196 --> 13:27.328
Well if it doesn't work
out with your mom

13:27.415 --> 13:29.809
does he like old
black ladies?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.723
My grandma will do a
lot more for a lot less.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.035
[crowd cheering]

13:44.998 --> 13:46.129
These are the
best seats ever.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.609
You know, if we wanted to

13:47.696 --> 13:50.394
we could actually trip the guys
on the other team.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.615
- But we won't, right?
- No, no, I'm just saying.

13:53.702 --> 13:56.226
But we'd probably get on TV.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.620
- Go Bulls!
- Whoo!

13:58.707 --> 14:00.013
It's so hard not
to trip them now

14:00.100 --> 14:02.015
'cause I'm-I'm
thinking about it.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.625
I won't, I won't, I won't.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.670
How about the courtside
service, huh?

14:05.757 --> 14:07.107
That's a nice little perk.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.673
I know,
before one beer is finished

14:08.760 --> 14:10.675
another one magically
appears in my hand.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.548
Same with nachos. It's like
the guy can read my mind.

14:13.635 --> 14:16.029
The whistling and the pointing
at your mouth probably helps.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.292
Whoo!

14:18.379 --> 14:20.424
You realize that by
accepting these tickets

14:20.511 --> 14:22.774
I'm essentially
pimping out my mom.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.602
Worth it.

14:24.689 --> 14:25.908
And you didn't
pimp her out

14:25.995 --> 14:27.170
they're just having
dinner together.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.606
My mother and my boss.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.304
I keep waiting
for the phone call

14:30.391 --> 14:32.523
telling me I'm out of work,
and she's under arrest.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.829
She seems like
the kind of woman

14:33.916 --> 14:35.744
that might actually
flourish in prison.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.398
Whoo!

14:37.485 --> 14:39.226
Oh, yeah, she would
definitely be in her element

14:39.313 --> 14:40.749
but we would still
have to visit her.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.534
True, but the-there's
the protective glass.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.232
Legs. Go, Bulls!

14:47.103 --> 14:48.844
It's win-win, you've done
a favor for your boss

14:48.931 --> 14:50.541
and your mom might finally

14:50.628 --> 14:53.066
have some male companionship
that's more masculine than her.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.547
[laughs]

14:56.634 --> 14:58.723
Give it back.
Molly?

15:01.813 --> 15:04.773
- I could've totally made that.
- I know. I know.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.956
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- This thing is a beast!

15:14.043 --> 15:15.436
I love being up high too.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.960
It gives me a false sense
of superiority.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.657
There's nothing false about it,
this is the finest

15:19.744 --> 15:21.703
urban police vehicle
on the road today.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.227
It's so big, it makes me feel
like I actually lost

15:24.314 --> 15:27.187
the 35 pounds
I told the captain I did.

15:27.274 --> 15:30.016
Hey, listen to this,
"High speed rear crash tested

15:30.103 --> 15:33.802
level three ballistic door
panels, framed in boron steel."

15:33.889 --> 15:35.978
They put boron
in this baby?

15:36.065 --> 15:37.762
This is Robocop
kind of stuff, man.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.200
[imitating Robocop]
The future is now.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.679
Hey, let me drive.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.855
No way! My mom's the
one dating the captain

15:43.943 --> 15:46.075
so get used to sitting bench.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.947
Come on, man,
it's bad enough I didn't go

15:48.034 --> 15:50.079
to the Bulls game last night.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.995
Alright, after lunch, we'll
find an empty parking lot

15:53.082 --> 15:55.519
and I'll let you toodle
it around a little bit.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.392
I'll need to lock my seat
position into the memory.

15:58.479 --> 16:02.265
Oh, that seat's not
going to forget you.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.875
It's all the way back,
all the way down

16:03.963 --> 16:07.053
and after lunch, it's with
the door cracked open.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.663
Just for that, I'm not
going to let you drive.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.752
Come on, don't be that way!

16:10.839 --> 16:12.972
[automated message]
'Test Car One,
captain requests your presence'

16:13.059 --> 16:14.016
'back at the station.'

16:14.103 --> 16:16.758
That's us.
Where's the radio?

16:16.845 --> 16:18.455
I don't know
if there is one.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.501
It might be voice activated.

16:20.588 --> 16:24.505
We hear you,
and we are responding!

16:24.592 --> 16:27.595
[automated message]
'Test Car One, do you read?'

16:27.682 --> 16:30.467
Yes. Yes, we read.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.295
Hit the lights,
we better just get there.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.210
Lights, lights.
Where are the lights?

16:43.263 --> 16:46.222
- Captain, you wanted to see me?
- Sit down, Biggs.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.271
Is there a problem, sir?
Did my mom order the lobster?

16:51.358 --> 16:55.753
Take a seat, and hand over
the keys to the test vehicle.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.842
That baby handles
like a champ, sir.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.453
My only complaint would
be the cup holder

16:59.540 --> 17:03.109
which can't accommodate
anything over 32 ounces.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.546
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.591
We're giving you back
your old squad car.

17:07.678 --> 17:08.984
I can't go back
to my old car.

17:09.071 --> 17:12.161
That like going back
to single stuffed Oreos.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.033
After last night's
dinner with your mother

17:14.120 --> 17:16.992
I am not feeling very
generous towards you.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.473
Sir, now I told you
she was a bit ornery.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.779
Granted, that's like saying my
alligator's a bit of a nipper

17:24.217 --> 17:25.609
but you were warned.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.351
- Your mother was a delight.
- Come again?

17:28.438 --> 17:31.441
Funny, vibrant and
a straight-shooter.

17:31.528 --> 17:32.703
You're speaking
metaphorically.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.924
She didn't actually
try to shoot you?

17:36.011 --> 17:37.839
The only sour note
of the whole evening

17:37.926 --> 17:40.537
is when the subject
of you came up.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.757
Is this about me being
a 14-pound baby?

17:42.844 --> 17:46.021
I know I did a number on her,
but you can't blame me.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.763
This isn't about a baby,
this is about a grown

17:48.850 --> 17:51.809
man who ignores the woman
who sacrificed and toiled

17:51.896 --> 17:56.597
to make sure that hip-splitting
ingrate had a good life.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.990
I don't know what she told you,
but you've got to take

17:59.078 --> 18:01.645
everything she says
with a grain of salt.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.431
Might be time for you
and that party girl you married

18:04.518 --> 18:07.260
to put your sainted mother
on your social calendar.

18:09.523 --> 18:10.785
Sir, I don't know
where you guys ate

18:10.872 --> 18:12.787
but I know what she fed you.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.793
From now on,
Sundays belong to her.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.143
No ifs, ands, or buts.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.927
And help her out
around the house

18:23.014 --> 18:24.712
at least enough
to keep the animals

18:24.799 --> 18:28.107
from chewing off
her angel face.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.457
Sir, I have found
no evidence to support

18:30.544 --> 18:32.633
the repeated claims
of wild animals.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.678
Say one more thing
against that lovely woman

18:34.765 --> 18:37.420
you're guarding porta potties
outside Soldier Field.

18:37.507 --> 18:40.423
- Is that understood?
- Loud and clear, sir.

18:40.510 --> 18:43.470
- Knock, knock.
- And there she is. Ooh hoo-hoo!

18:43.557 --> 18:45.950
- Look at those stems.
- Mom?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.517
Michael, what a sweet surprise.

18:47.604 --> 18:50.390
I feel like
I haven't seen you in forever.

18:50.477 --> 18:51.739
Mom, what's with the getup?

18:51.826 --> 18:53.567
Oh, you know
I like to look nice.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.656
Murph wanted to take me
to lunch, but I thought

18:55.743 --> 18:58.659
I'd pack us a little picnic
instead, if that's okay.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.749
Oh, that's more than okay.
That's perfect.

19:01.836 --> 19:05.840
Oh, what a sweet,
considerate woman...you are.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.766
You're a lucky man, Biggs.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.290
Yeah, lucky.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.337
Think I need a little air.
Getting kinda light-headed.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.079
Do you like breasts or legs?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.559
Can I decide
after I eat the chicken?

19:29.646 --> 19:31.039
Oh!

19:31.126 --> 19:33.607
Wake up. Wake up.

19:33.694 --> 19:34.999
Oh, God, it's real.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.311
No, they're here, Murph.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.095
She's setting the
table and he's upstairs

19:44.183 --> 19:45.880
trying to get rid
of that raccoon.

19:45.967 --> 19:49.840
- Raccoon, my ass.
- I'm on the phone.

19:49.927 --> 19:52.060
Can you swing by later
for coffee and dessert?

19:52.147 --> 19:53.975
I'll save you a big piece.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.933
Oh, you're terrible.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.893
No, I was talking about pie.

19:58.980 --> 20:02.157
Oh! You're terrible!

20:02.244 --> 20:04.115
[Peggy laughs]

20:04.203 --> 20:06.422
Alright, we'll see you later.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.295
Every possible point of entry
is sealed with chicken wire.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.775
You shouldn't be bothered
by raccoons again, mom.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.386
Thank you for being
so thorough.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.170
I'll be sure to mention
it to the captain.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.697
Ooh, I better crack open
some Cool Whip for the pie.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.223
What the hell were you thinking

20:24.310 --> 20:25.659
setting your mom up
with your boss?

20:25.746 --> 20:27.617
Aren't you the one who
told me it was a win-win?

20:27.704 --> 20:29.097
Hey, when you're
sitting courtside

20:29.184 --> 20:31.491
the whole world's
made of cotton candy.

with mom and the captain.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.595
Mom and the captain,
