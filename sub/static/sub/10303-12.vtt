01:18.480 --> 01:20.789
Disodium guanylate.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.599
Diacetyl tartaric acid.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.358
I don't feel good about this, Bud.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.235
I mean, I know we're mad at Dad for not
letting us have a party and everything...

01:32.440 --> 01:34.032
...but even he doesn't deserve this.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.471
This is cool
and unusable punishment.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.988
Desperate times
call for desperate measures, Kel.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.677
Now, just a little
pyridoxine hydrochloride...

01:47.600 --> 01:50.672
...and voila.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.956
Snack mountain.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.356
Now, once Dad washes this down
with tonight's episode of Psycho Dad...

01:59.560 --> 02:02.597
...he'll say yes quicker
than you do on a first date.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.630
Sure hope you're right.

02:09.039 --> 02:11.793
Oh, good morning, kids.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.639
Gee, you guys are up early.
What time is it?

02:19.880 --> 02:21.472
Five p.m.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.473
Oh, darn,
I slept through my afternoon nap.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.709
So, what are you up to?

02:27.920 --> 02:30.639
Oh, just trying to bribe Daddy
into letting us have a party.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.439
You know, that could be tough.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.636
I don't think he's forgotten
the last one.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.398
You know, the nightsticks,
the sirens, the strip-searches...

02:40.920 --> 02:44.469
Not to mention what happened
after the police got here.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.997
Mom, a woman only turns 12 once.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.710
I'm much more of an adulteress now.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.278
So you think Dad'll go for it, Ma?

02:56.520 --> 02:58.158
Well, I don't know...

02:58.400 --> 03:02.951
...but at least you have his two favourite
food groups here. Greasy and salty.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.870
And to seal the deal,
Psycho Dad's on tonight.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.958
Yeah, for the sake of the party,
I hope he still likes the show.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.875
Who's that riding into the sun?

03:24.080 --> 03:27.390
Who's the man with the itchy gun?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.876
Who's the man who kills for fun?

03:31.120 --> 03:37.070
Psycho Dad, Psycho Dad
Psycho Dad

03:42.360 --> 03:46.478
Hi, Bud. Hi, Kelly.
Hi, couch monster.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.079
Anybody know what night it is?

03:50.480 --> 03:54.871
The night the rest of your body
secedes from your armpits?

03:55.480 --> 03:59.155
Peg, how do you think of those
and fight gravity at the same time?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.072
Anyway, tonight there's a very special
episode of the Dad on.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.279
He caught his wife and the schoolmarm
teaching his son housework...

04:07.520 --> 04:10.478
...but he's only got one cartridge left.
What does he do?

04:10.680 --> 04:11.749
What would any of us do?

04:13.520 --> 04:18.036
Dad, did you...? Did you notice
we made you some Psycho Dad vittles?

04:18.640 --> 04:22.758
Yes, a veritable coronary-copia
of your favourites.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.069
I'm sorry, but they were out
of the twice-fried gristle logs.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.959
You two are the best kids
any father accidentally ever had.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.711
Now, come on, beat it.
Psycho Dad's coming on.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.716
- When do we ask him about the party?
- Okay, as soon as Psycho Dad is over.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.520
- Okay.
- And now, ladies and gentlemen...

04:45.720 --> 04:48.359
Psycho Dad!

04:48.560 --> 04:50.152
- Will not be seen tonight...

04:50.400 --> 04:55.155
...so we may present
the All Barbara Special.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.678
Stay tuned as Barbara Walters
interviews Barbra Streisand...

04:58.920 --> 05:03.038
...Barbara Bush,
and then Barbra Streisand again.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.111
No Psycho Dad?

05:07.360 --> 05:10.591
How can this be, Peg?
What moron is behind this?

05:18.760 --> 05:21.991
Who's the guy whose show is done?

05:22.200 --> 05:25.636
Whose TV hero's on the run?

05:25.880 --> 05:29.156
Who'll be watching VH1?

05:29.400 --> 05:34.997
Loser Al, Loser Al
Loser Al

05:37.840 --> 05:40.354
Marcie, I don't think
this is a very good time.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.750
Are you kidding?
This is a great time.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.073
My women's group finally helped
get Psycho Dad cancelled.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.518
Cancelled? You got it cancelled?

05:51.720 --> 05:54.154
Indeed-y do.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.789
- Okay, now can we ask him?
- No.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.589
Why not?
The show couldn't be more over.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.558
Why, Marcie?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.357
Because Psycho Dad
was the most violent programme on TV.

06:09.560 --> 06:12.791
Did you know that they portrayed
an average of 84 killings...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.508
...per one-hour show?

06:16.480 --> 06:19.153
Well, a man's got to reload.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.119
My point, earwig...

06:24.360 --> 06:27.750
...is that violence on TV
desensitizes people.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.310
Well, so does marriage,
and they haven't cancelled that yet.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.959
Despite all my letters.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.476
And I don't want to hear any of that
politically-correct rooster poop...

06:40.720 --> 06:43.314
...that television is the cause
of all our problems.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.633
People don't act a certain way
just because it's on TV.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.868
You know, that's true.
Al watches a lot of sex on HBO.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.998
And Peg watches a lot of Models Inc.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.829
Al, violence has no place
on the streets or on TV.

07:02.040 --> 07:07.194
And we've got to start somewhere.
Today Psycho Dad, tomorrow...

07:07.400 --> 07:10.198
...everything else that men enjoy.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.270
Okay, now can we ask him?

07:25.480 --> 07:26.959
Are you for real...

07:27.200 --> 07:30.795
...or has someone switched you
with a pod from the planet Bimbo?

07:32.560 --> 07:35.632
And if so, are...?
Are there more like you?

07:36.760 --> 07:39.957
Hey, Al, what gives?

07:41.800 --> 07:46.351
Yeah. Yeah. Did they take off
Psycho Dad on your TV too?

07:47.440 --> 07:49.032
Oh, hey.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.832
Hey.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.471
Ranch style.

07:54.920 --> 08:00.074
Stand back, kids.
Huey, Dewey and Ewey are here.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.348
Men, listen up.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.598
They've cancelled Psycho Dad.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.796
- What?
- Yes.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.354
And you know who's behind it?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.158
- Women?
- No.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.437
Marcie D'Arcy, chicken-at-large.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.111
Well, I say there's no way
we'll give up our Psycho Dad.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.112
- What can we do?
- We can write letters.

08:22.360 --> 08:27.388
- Well, real men don't write letters.
- They do to Penthouse.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.508
They got letters in Penthouse?

08:32.760 --> 08:34.990
Of course they have letters
in Penthouse.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.549
So you have something to do
right after you...

08:45.160 --> 08:46.878
Right after you...

08:47.920 --> 08:50.673
You finish reading the interviews.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.149
They got interviews in Penthouse?

08:54.360 --> 08:56.590
All right, come on, everyone, think.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.755
We're men. Let's use the power
of our giant manly brains.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.915
Ma, they've been like that
for hours now.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.635
Should we get the jumper cables?

09:28.080 --> 09:29.911
No need.

09:34.480 --> 09:39.076
I got it! We'll picket the TV stations.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.912
Once word gets out, men will come...

09:41.120 --> 09:43.839
...from every part of the country.
Men, gather the troops.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.112
This will be the biggest demonstration
Chicago has ever had.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.952
Yeah.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.275
- Hey, Al.
- Yeah?

10:11.520 --> 10:14.990
You remember that
letter-writing idea I had?

10:21.200 --> 10:26.718
Bring back Psycho Dad.
Bring back Psycho Dad.

10:26.960 --> 10:32.353
Bring back Psycho Dad.
Bring back Psycho Dad.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.513
Bring back the feeling in my feet.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.513
All right, take a two-minute break.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.792
- How long have we been here?
- Counting the break...

10:43.600 --> 10:45.591
...2 and a half minutes.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.274
Say, Al, don't think that
I'm not grateful...

10:49.520 --> 10:51.750
...for your dragging me out
of a warm pool hall...

10:52.000 --> 10:54.639
...to picket
on this balmy winter morn.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.757
But are you sure
that anyone is giving...

10:57.000 --> 11:00.788
...oh, say, a rat's patoot about this?

11:01.040 --> 11:03.554
Boy, you don't know anything
about America, do you?

11:03.800 --> 11:06.473
Its landscape
will be littered with frozen dead guys...

11:06.720 --> 11:08.836
...if we don't get the hell out of here.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.788
Well, for your information, ladies...

11:14.040 --> 11:16.793
...this country was founded
on the power of protest.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.635
From the Boston Tea Party
to the March of Dimes.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.108
The strong and the brave...

11:22.360 --> 11:25.193
...have always stood up
to make their voices heard.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.829
Well, Al Bundy, too,
will make his voice heard.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.514
I will stand, I will fight, I will...

11:30.920 --> 11:33.753
Boys, here comes the cops.
Ditch the signs.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.032
Well?

11:46.240 --> 11:48.196
Hey, Officer Dan.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.990
How's the wife and kids?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.752
Warm.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.797
Why aren't I?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.355
Well, if by that you mean...

11:59.600 --> 12:02.398
...what are we doing here, well, we...

12:03.440 --> 12:05.476
Tell him, Jefferson.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.750
Al made us come.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.914
- Thanks, Jefferson. Nice cover.
- Okay.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.958
Okay, boys,
let's head for the squad car.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.031
Aren't you even gonna search us?

12:16.280 --> 12:18.714
It's 13 degrees out here.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.555
I don't even care
what I've got concealed.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.512
Oh, come on, Dan. Give us a break.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.796
We're just protesting, that's all.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.237
Protest or no protest.
You just can't gather a...

12:31.840 --> 12:33.512
Psycho Dad?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.913
They took off Psycho Dad?

12:39.080 --> 12:43.232
Bring back Psycho Dad.
Bring back Psycho Dad.

12:43.480 --> 12:48.793
Bring back Psycho Dad.
Bring back Psycho Dad.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.350
I don't understand it. The press must
have gotten wind of this by now.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.513
- What could be keeping them?
- Polar bears, maybe?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.991
All right, a couple of more times
around and we'll take a few...

13:00.200 --> 13:02.111
...months off.

13:03.520 --> 13:07.308
Hey, look, I think I see
another protestor coming.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.988
Okay, snap to, boys.
Make him feel welcome.

13:10.240 --> 13:15.712
- Bring back Psycho Dad.
- Let your kids have a party.

13:15.960 --> 13:21.512
- Bring back Psycho Dad.
- Let your kids have a party.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.957
Bring back Psycho Dad.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.390
- Let...
- Hey now!

13:29.200 --> 13:31.350
Sergeant at Arms Ike...

13:31.560 --> 13:32.788
...eject the infidel.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.195
- Yeah, get him.
- Get him, Ike! Get him!

13:39.520 --> 13:41.431
Hey, Al, I've got an idea.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.671
Bob Rooney's got a heated garage.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.550
Yeah, and he's got the profile
of a manatee too. What's your point?

13:47.800 --> 13:50.678
Well, we could protest there
and be warm.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.679
Protest in Bob Rooney's garage.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.514
But how can we be sure our message
will reach the people?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.313
We'll leave our signs outside.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.913
Genius.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.835
Now, let's see. It's 40 degrees below
zero with 20 mile an hour winds.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.390
Who do we send outside today?
One of our many Aryan anchormen...

14:16.640 --> 14:20.076
...or the woman from a country
named after the equator?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.436
- You're on.
- Hi.

14:22.680 --> 14:26.514
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal.

14:26.760 --> 14:30.912
And we are here live
outside the studios of WHBZ...

14:31.160 --> 14:33.754
...where some sort
of pro-violence demonstration...

14:34.000 --> 14:35.718
...was supposed to be held.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.918
But the only evidence
we could find is a crumpled copy...

14:39.120 --> 14:41.554
...of Penthouse Magazine...

14:41.760 --> 14:46.072
...and the name "Al"
mysteriously written in the snow.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.518
So once again,
it seems the joke's on me.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.671
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal saying:

14:54.880 --> 14:56.677
I'd have that anchor job by now...

14:56.920 --> 15:01.311
...if I had just slept with Peter Jennings
instead of Andy Rooney.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.031
Hi, Daddy. How are you feeling?

15:14.960 --> 15:16.916
Well, let's see.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.351
I'm dead.

15:22.080 --> 15:26.596
Oh, good.
Now, what would you say if I told you...

15:26.800 --> 15:30.076
...that Bud and I got
Psycho Dad back on the air?

15:30.520 --> 15:32.750
You got Psycho Dad back on the air?

15:32.960 --> 15:36.032
You better not be kidding or you're
gonna have to outrun the Dodge.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.997
Rush Limbaugh
can outrun the Dodge.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.352
No, seriously, Dad, if we could get
Psycho Dad back on the air...

15:46.560 --> 15:49.552
...would you let us throw a party?
- Lf you got Psycho Dad back...

15:49.760 --> 15:54.515
...on air, not only would I let you throw
a party, I'd provide the fake vomit.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.954
Well, break out the barf, Dad,
because we got Psycho Dad...

16:00.200 --> 16:02.589
...back on the air,
and it's on right now.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.797
But close your eyes first, Dad...

16:06.000 --> 16:10.232
...because there's a few minutes left
of Saved by the Bell, The Prison Years.

16:18.840 --> 16:24.915
And now, the return
of your favourite Western, Psycho Dad.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.634
Well, shut my mouth
and call me Mary.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.990
That is Psycho Dad.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.237
That is Psycho Dad.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.397
- What...? What's wrong?
- Just my stinking luck. It's a rerun.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.033
- A rerun?
- Yeah, yeah, I recognize this episode.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.555
This is the part
where he's gonna shoot his wife...

16:47.800 --> 16:52.032
...she ducks and he accidentally kills
President Lincoln instead.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.076
Damn women.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.394
That's no problem. I'll just fast-forward
the tape to the part you don't remember.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.031
Dad, we only did this
to make you happy.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.669
It wasn't to trick you
into letting us have a party...

17:08.880 --> 17:11.519
...or that nifty vomit thing
or anything.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.873
I knew it was too good to be true.

17:15.119 --> 17:19.715
- So can we have a party?
- Begone, children of the corn.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.196
Way to go, VCR Minus.

17:26.040 --> 17:30.113
Well, like they say in France,
comme ci, comme di.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.911
Al, turn on the TV. Psycho Dad's on.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.832
Yeah, and my wife and kids...

17:37.080 --> 17:40.470
...are just figments
of Stephen King's imagination.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.678
No, really. It's on the news.
He's holding a press conference.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.959
He is? He is. I knew he wouldn't
take this lying down.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.953
- Hey, I bet he got my letter.
- You wrote Psycho Dad a letter?

17:51.160 --> 17:53.515
Not actually a letter,
but I cut out some letters...

17:53.720 --> 17:57.156
...from the newspaper
and taped it in, you know.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.392
Like the way Psycho Dad did
when he kidnapped the circuit judge...

18:00.640 --> 18:02.995
...so there couldn't be no wedding.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.633
I knew the Psychster
wouldn't let his biggest fans down.

18:09.080 --> 18:14.200
Sure the cancellation was a shock.
I felt hurt, I'd been rejected.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.159
I thought,
"Well, nobody cares anymore...

18:17.400 --> 18:22.076
...about a simple saga
of a guy run amok in the old West."

18:22.400 --> 18:24.755
The man's a freaking poet.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.872
And while I was at my lowest,
this letter arrived.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.711
Maybe that's my letter.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.833
It came postage due.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.516
It is my letter.

18:41.960 --> 18:48.274
I'd lik e to read it to you now.
"Dear, Syk o Dad," spelled S-Y-K-O.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.037
What? You try to find
P's and H's in USA Today.

18:56.280 --> 19:00.717
"Hi, my name is Al.
I'm just a regular Joe.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.635
Sure I scored four touchdowns
in a game once.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.788
But that's not the point.
The point is...

19:13.040 --> 19:16.396
...I lik e you, Psycho Dad,
I really, really lik e you.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.154
No, not in that way.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.197
So please don't let them
tak e you off.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.115
I beg you, fight this thing
lik e you would fight a varmint...

19:27.360 --> 19:31.399
...or an ex-wife. Your friend, Al.

19:31.640 --> 19:36.031
P.S., What does Barbara Eden
look lik e nak ed?"

19:37.200 --> 19:40.317
- Barbara Eden?
- She's 1000.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.512
I didn't mean now.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.718
Ladies and gentlemen,
this letter has made clear to me...

19:46.960 --> 19:51.636
...that if Psycho Dad elicits
this kind of response from the public...

19:51.880 --> 19:55.589
...there's only one thing I can do.
- Fight! Fight!

19:55.800 --> 19:57.677
- Quit.
- What?

19:57.920 --> 19:59.148
Yes, quit.

19:59.400 --> 20:03.871
Quit, apologize, and renounce forever
the character of Psycho Dad.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.509
If this is the kind of following
that I inspire...

20:06.760 --> 20:09.752
...then I'm afraid I must stop leading.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.749
However, since the network's
offering me big bucks...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.389
...be sure to watch me
in my new show:

20:16.640 --> 20:21.191
Lefkowitz, Special Education
Teacher's Aide.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.999
Thank you.

20:23.480 --> 20:28.793
And to you, Al,
goodbye and get help.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.468
I can't believe Psycho Dad
would sell us out.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.472
That's not Psycho Dad talking.

20:35.040 --> 20:41.354
He doesn't use words like "character"
or "education" or "Lefkowitz."

20:41.600 --> 20:44.717
He's been brainwashed by people
like Marcie and her do-gooders.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.428
Well, we've got
to think of something.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.111
Use the power
of our giant manly brains?

20:51.360 --> 20:53.590
No, that would take too long.

20:54.280 --> 20:59.832
Yeah. What would Psycho Dad do
if he were one of us?

21:00.080 --> 21:04.835
He would... He'd take some women
hostage and make them do laundry.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.037
No, Psycho Dad
don't have no laundry.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.192
He's been wearing
the same Psycho suit for 7 years.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.755
And now he's hanging it up for good.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.594
Well, we can't just sit here
and let it happen.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.994
What do you want us to do? We're not
going back to ice station Zebra again.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.028
No. I'm taking this fight to the place
that stands for liberty.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.034
- That stands for freedom of expression.
- The nudie bar?

21:35.640 --> 21:38.154
No. Well, maybe first.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.277
Then we're going
to our nation's capital.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.559
Gentlemen, NO MA'AM
is going to Washington!
