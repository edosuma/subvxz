00:01.990 --> 00:05.289
Previously on "big brother".

00:05.290 --> 00:09.989
Austin, Liz, Julia and
Vanessa formed a new

00:09.990 --> 00:10.990
alliance.

00:10.990 --> 00:11.990
I love it.

00:11.991 --> 00:14.989
And then formed another
one with Steve.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.989
The scamper squad.

00:17.990 --> 00:20.289
With John and Becky on block.

00:20.290 --> 00:23.829
I have nominated you
Becky and you Johnnie mack.

00:23.830 --> 00:27.989
Both nominees through
Vanessa under the bus.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.989
It's obvious that I
perceive to be a threat.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.989
I've been after Vanessa
for a while now.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.989
I just haven't been telling
anyone.

00:34.990 --> 00:37.539
An when Becky reveals
some startling information.

00:37.540 --> 00:40.989
Was there a master pran
for that Bob.

00:40.990 --> 00:44.989
Was someone supposed to
throw it.

00:44.990 --> 00:48.119
Austin and the twins decided
it might be time to turn on

00:48.120 --> 00:49.539
their allies.

00:49.540 --> 00:52.989
I knew Vanessa was angry
at me during her hoh with

00:52.990 --> 00:54.999
Jackie but I had no clue
that she was actually

00:55.000 --> 00:56.989
planning my entire demise.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.989
With numbers dwindling,
Ally Steve and John wanted

00:59.990 --> 01:01.989
to choose a side of the house.

01:01.990 --> 01:06.989
We should buddy buddy up.

01:06.990 --> 01:07.990
With Austin and twins.

01:07.991 --> 01:10.409
So they made a new
five-person alliance.

01:10.410 --> 01:11.989
We definitely want to
work with you.

01:11.990 --> 01:14.989
I wish I had thought of it!

01:14.990 --> 01:15.990
I did!

01:15.991 --> 01:19.989
And his help keeps John
in the game.

01:19.990 --> 01:24.949
Julie: By a vote of 6-0,
Becky, you are evicted from

01:24.950 --> 01:26.989
the "Big Brother" house.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.989
With only eight house
guests remaining, a race for

01:29.990 --> 01:31.989
power began.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.989
Go!

01:33.990 --> 01:37.829
Oh what a surprise.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.989
Julie: Sorry Meg, you
buzzed in last, you've been

01:39.990 --> 01:40.990
eliminated.

01:40.991 --> 01:43.829
Tonight, who will end up
running the house and which

01:43.830 --> 01:45.699
two house guests will be
nominatedded.

01:45.700 --> 01:52.989
Find out right now on "big
brother".

01:52.990 --> 02:00.990
Oh my God
captioning funded by CBS

02:02.990 --> 02:10.990
oh my God
captioning funded by CBS

02:22.990 --> 02:29.699
oh my God
captioning funded by CBS

02:29.700 --> 02:30.000
!

02:30.001 --> 02:38.001
All right, ready to begin
round two.

02:38.990 --> 02:39.990
Ready, set.

02:39.991 --> 02:41.989
Careful.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.699
Y'all looking good.

02:44.700 --> 02:45.989
Thank you.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.539
So this competition, you
get on your starting block

02:48.540 --> 02:50.999
and hold down all three
buttons, one with each hand

02:51.000 --> 02:52.409
and one with a foot.

02:52.410 --> 02:54.989
And we have to hold until it
says go.

02:54.990 --> 02:57.989
Oh my God,.

02:57.990 --> 03:00.989
When you see the word go
you race across the yard and

03:00.990 --> 03:01.990
you buzz in.

03:01.991 --> 03:05.699
The house guest that hits
the buzzer last will be

03:05.700 --> 03:06.949
eliminated.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.989
If you release any of your
buttons before you see the

03:08.990 --> 03:10.989
word go, you would be
eliminated.

03:10.990 --> 03:15.999
Then the last person
standing will be the new

03:16.000 --> 03:16.990
hoh.

03:16.991 --> 03:18.989
Stay focused.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.989
Now you are supposed to
go on the word go, however

03:21.990 --> 03:27.989
I'm seeing slow, bro and
then there's bro.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.989
Bro.

03:29.990 --> 03:34.989
Hey, does anyone remember
Jace, the ultimate bro?

03:34.990 --> 03:38.989
What's up, Jace.

03:38.990 --> 03:40.989
Winning hoh this week
will guarantee my safety and

03:40.990 --> 03:44.989
I can get my target, Vanessa,
out of this game, possibly

03:44.990 --> 03:45.000
for good.

03:45.001 --> 03:47.989
How are you doing, boysies.

03:47.990 --> 03:48.990
Without wants it?

03:48.991 --> 03:50.989
Are they talking to us?

03:50.990 --> 03:51.990
They're talking to us.

03:51.991 --> 03:54.989
Vanessa is the big enemy
in the house this week.

03:54.990 --> 03:56.989
However, she's also one of
my closest allies.

03:56.990 --> 03:59.949
So I don't want to be the
one responsible for sending

03:59.950 --> 04:00.830
her home.

04:00.831 --> 04:01.989
It might be in my best
interest to let somebody

04:01.990 --> 04:05.989
else win.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.409
Don't take your hands-off.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.999
My best is for me, Julia
or Austin to win so my

04:12.000 --> 04:14.989
alliance can stay in power
an send a fourth person to

04:14.990 --> 04:15.990
the jury.

04:15.991 --> 04:22.989
All right, guys Meg goes
out first but that's okay

04:22.990 --> 04:24.989
because I know she is tired.

04:24.990 --> 04:27.999
Now it's time for me to win
this hoh to get Vanessa out

04:28.000 --> 04:32.989
of this house.

04:32.990 --> 04:37.989
Oh, wait, what the hell,
no, I'm ready, him's set and

04:37.990 --> 04:41.999
I move my rate hand off the
buzzer.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.989
I'm sorry, Julia, you
false started.

04:44.990 --> 04:46.989
That means you've been
eliminated.

04:46.990 --> 04:49.989
Come join the winners'
circle, baby.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.990
I'm so mad.

04:50.990 --> 04:50.991
I told you.

04:50.991 --> 04:51.990
Be careful.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.989
All right, guys, you have
one minute before the next

04:54.990 --> 04:54.991
race.

04:54.991 --> 04:56.989
Good one, Julia.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.289
I ran track & field in high
school this was my hoh to

05:00.290 --> 05:01.989
win and I blew it.

05:01.990 --> 05:04.829
Now this game is resting on
Austin's shoulders.

05:04.830 --> 05:07.989
All right, time for round three.

05:07.990 --> 05:15.990
Ready, set.

05:18.990 --> 05:26.990
This sucks.

05:29.990 --> 05:30.990
Oh.

05:30.991 --> 05:32.989
I'm sorry, Vanessa you
false started.

05:32.990 --> 05:36.989
You have you've been eliminated.

05:36.990 --> 05:40.989
So my foot went you have
the button.

05:40.990 --> 05:43.989
Now that I'm out it's up to
Austin and Steve to win this

05:43.990 --> 05:46.949
one and keep us in power for
another week.

05:46.950 --> 05:47.989
Vanessa is eliminated.

05:47.990 --> 05:48.990
I'm relieved.

05:48.991 --> 05:51.409
My biggest target has been
eliminated out of the became

05:51.410 --> 05:54.989
and now it's time for me to
try to get my third hoh

05:54.990 --> 05:56.989
under my belt.

05:56.990 --> 06:01.989
It's down to the boys.

06:01.990 --> 06:02.990
About time guys start
running stuff.

06:02.991 --> 06:05.989
About time, all the girls
on the sidelines wow.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.989
This head of household
competition is tough.

06:07.990 --> 06:12.989
It's endures, it's physical,
it's mental, it requires

06:12.990 --> 06:15.989
extreme focus, this is going
to be interesting.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.989
Let's begin round four.

06:17.990 --> 06:25.989
Ready, set, don't take your
hand off.

06:25.990 --> 06:25.991
Oh.

06:25.991 --> 06:28.289
Right out of the gate?

06:28.290 --> 06:34.989
In the time to run yet.

06:34.990 --> 06:39.989
Oh.

06:39.990 --> 06:41.989
They're taunteding us.

06:41.990 --> 06:44.829
The hardest part of this
competition is holding this

06:44.830 --> 06:46.989
big old head up on this
little body.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.989
I'm all stretched down in a
squatting position and I got

06:49.990 --> 06:51.989
to hold all this weight up.

06:51.990 --> 06:59.990
It puts all the stress on
the back of my neck.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.989
I was ready to take off
on that one.

07:06.990 --> 07:09.989
Oh.

07:09.990 --> 07:12.989
Them are fighting words.

07:12.990 --> 07:20.990
You go play your mind
games with me, supertv hey

07:26.990 --> 07:34.990
guys.

07:36.990 --> 07:44.990
Guys.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.989
> I'm sorry Johnnie mack,
you were last to the finish.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.989
That means you've been
eliminated.

07:51.990 --> 07:54.989
I'm supposed to be the
runner here and I got beat

07:54.990 --> 07:58.989
by Steve and a kid that
should be at mathlet, s right

07:58.990 --> 07:59.990
now.

07:59.991 --> 08:01.989
Hopefully James can take it
this week, now that I can't,

08:01.990 --> 08:04.989
even though I wanted credit
for it.

08:04.990 --> 08:08.989
Sucks.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.989
All right, it's down to the
final three, Austin, James

08:11.990 --> 08:12.410
and Steve.

08:12.411 --> 08:16.989
Yeah, boys.

08:16.990 --> 08:19.989
Is it's come down to
myself, James and Steve in

08:19.990 --> 08:23.989
this hoh competition and
yeah, I could bow out right

08:23.990 --> 08:25.989
now because I have deals
with a lot of people.

08:25.990 --> 08:28.999
But if I win I could
guarantee my safety and the

08:29.000 --> 08:35.289
twins' safety no matter what.

08:35.290 --> 08:36.989
I hate this.

08:36.990 --> 08:39.989
I know, I don't know what it
is about this game.

08:39.990 --> 08:43.989
I know it's so important
for James to win this

08:43.990 --> 08:46.989
competition because he's the
only person in the house I

08:46.990 --> 08:50.699
can fully trust and we'll
know for sure that I'm not

08:50.700 --> 08:52.989
going home this week.

08:52.990 --> 09:00.409
Nice cup of Joe.

09:00.410 --> 09:06.989
> This is not easy on your
knees.

09:06.990 --> 09:07.999
James.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.949
This competition... James
was in the military, Austin

09:11.950 --> 09:12.989
a professional wellser.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.989
There is no way I will
outrun these guys, the only

09:15.990 --> 09:18.989
way I would beat them is if
they accidentally let go and

09:18.990 --> 09:20.989
coy end up being hoh again.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.289
Time out, time out, time out.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.989
Can we call a time out.

09:23.990 --> 09:31.990
Kidding, kidding, no, no, go.

09:36.950 --> 09:38.999
Oh did you let go?

09:39.000 --> 09:43.989
Ness oh, Steve.

09:43.990 --> 09:44.990
No!

09:44.991 --> 09:48.989
I'm sorry, Steve, looks
like you let go with your

09:48.990 --> 09:49.990
right hand.

09:49.991 --> 09:53.539
You've been eliminated.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.989
You okay.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.989
Yesia, I'm good.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.989
All right, it's time for
the final race.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.989
Austin versus James.

10:00.990 --> 10:02.989
Who will be the new head
of household.

10:02.990 --> 10:05.989
I'm really scared that
James is going to win and

10:05.990 --> 10:07.289
put up me and my sister.

10:07.290 --> 10:08.699
Go Austin.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.119
I hope you can win and we
can get another weak in the

10:11.120 --> 10:16.829
hoh room.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.989
> I'm scared, never have I
ever been rooting so hard

10:19.990 --> 10:22.989
for someone as I have right
now for Austin, because

10:22.990 --> 10:25.119
James is trying to surprise
people by making a big move

10:25.120 --> 10:27.989
and that big move could be
targeting myself or someone

10:27.990 --> 10:30.989
in my alliance and that's bad.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.999
Go.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.989
Austin if you win I'll
give you a smooch.

10:36.990 --> 10:40.989
Keep it up, boys, might
be a long one.

10:40.990 --> 10:40.991
James.

10:40.991 --> 10:43.989
What are you doing.

10:43.990 --> 10:46.989
Last few weeks I have
lost a lot of my soldiers,

10:46.990 --> 10:49.989
my closest Ally I have in
this house is Meg.

10:49.990 --> 10:52.989
I've got to win this hoh
comp to insurance that we

10:52.990 --> 10:55.989
don't end up on the block.

10:55.990 --> 10:58.989
Down to me and James and
I'm thinking yes, let's win

10:58.990 --> 11:01.999
this, this is juddas talking
because he knows that you

11:02.000 --> 11:05.989
can't trust anyone in this game.

11:05.990 --> 11:09.989
And a lot of alone time with
Liz up in the hoh.

11:09.990 --> 11:14.989
Go, go that's a g, to the
o, now go.

11:14.990 --> 11:22.990
Go!

11:24.990 --> 11:30.989
Go!

11:30.990 --> 11:33.989
I'm sorry, James, you were
the last to ring in, that

11:33.990 --> 11:35.989
means Austin, could be
gratlations, you are the new

11:35.990 --> 11:37.989
head of household.

11:37.990 --> 11:38.999
Choo!

11:39.000 --> 11:41.989
I feel pretty good with
Austin right to you because

11:41.990 --> 11:45.409
the on thing that I am
worried about is that he

11:45.410 --> 11:49.409
will probably recognize
senning Vanessa home this

11:49.410 --> 11:51.989
week isn't the best move for
his game, it's just the best

11:51.990 --> 11:53.989
move for my game.

11:53.990 --> 11:55.829
I hope nothing weird happens.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.989
So Austin is hoh this is
my best-case scenario.

11:58.990 --> 12:01.989
Someone I trust is in power
and at the same time I don't

12:01.990 --> 12:03.989
have to be the one getting
blood on my hands this week.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.539
Oh, man.

12:05.540 --> 12:06.989
I'm eck at that timic
that I won hoh.

12:06.990 --> 12:09.989
I get to spend time with my
queen up in the hoh ram.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.989
However it's time for me to
make a decision.

12:11.990 --> 12:15.989
Is Austin going to play this
game or is judd as.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.990
The time... it's time to
betray somebody

12:35.700 --> 12:38.989
Austin winning hoh is
very bittersweet.

12:38.990 --> 12:41.989
On the one hand I'm so
excited that we're still in

12:41.990 --> 12:44.119
power and Austin, Julie and
I are safe.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.989
But on the other hand, we
have to get even more blood

12:46.990 --> 12:48.989
on our hands this week.

12:48.990 --> 12:56.990
And Austin just has a big
decision to make.

12:58.990 --> 13:06.990
And Austin just has a big
decision to make.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.989
We don't have to make out.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.989
You've already gotten to
make out so...

13:12.990 --> 13:16.989
fair enough.

13:16.990 --> 13:18.989
Thank you.

13:18.990 --> 13:19.999
Thank you.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.829
Austin's hoh and I'm
feeling ready really good

13:23.830 --> 13:26.119
about this because I have
two alliances with him, so

13:26.120 --> 13:33.989
this is all around a win-win
for me.

13:33.990 --> 13:36.989
I mean I just didn't
trust him, you know, too

13:36.990 --> 13:37.990
risky.

13:37.990 --> 13:38.990
We're in the perfect spot.

13:38.990 --> 13:39.990
I know.

13:39.991 --> 13:41.989
But like we're in the
perfect spot and everyone

13:41.990 --> 13:44.829
realizes we're in the
perfect spot.

13:44.830 --> 13:47.989
And so you know what I'm
just going to let... I know

13:47.990 --> 13:50.989
because I'm scared of James
if he wants to make a big

13:50.990 --> 13:51.990
pov again.

13:51.991 --> 13:55.119
It's like really, it's
really krid call now that

13:55.120 --> 13:56.989
you cut deals with people.

13:56.990 --> 13:57.990
I know.

13:57.991 --> 13:59.989
We have nothing.

13:59.990 --> 14:00.990
Yeah.

14:00.991 --> 14:03.989
Yeah.

14:03.990 --> 14:05.829
Back up to the hoh room.

14:05.830 --> 14:06.989
I know, seriously.

14:06.990 --> 14:13.989
Too much time.

14:13.990 --> 14:14.990
Good job.

14:14.991 --> 14:16.989
I think it's best because
I think next week might be

14:16.990 --> 14:17.990
even better.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.989
I will need you for that.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.989
That's what I'm thinking.

14:22.990 --> 14:25.989
That was my problem, to
drone out, oh, yeah.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.699
I was thinking about
droing throwing it too.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.989
The twins and I have
aligned ourselves with

14:30.990 --> 14:31.990
everyone in the house.

14:31.991 --> 14:35.989
First you have Austin's
angels which is myself, the

14:35.990 --> 14:40.989
twins and Vanessa.

14:40.990 --> 14:44.989
I also have the scamper
squad which is myself, the

14:44.990 --> 14:47.989
twins, Vanessa and Steve.

14:47.990 --> 14:49.989
The scamper squad.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.949
The twins and I also have
an alliance with John and

14:53.950 --> 14:54.290
Steve.

14:54.291 --> 14:56.989
We definitely want to
work with you.

14:56.990 --> 14:57.990
Yup.

14:57.991 --> 15:01.989
An I even have an
alliance with Meg and James.

15:01.990 --> 15:03.989
We will keep each other
safe, just you two.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.989
We want this to be the
brass tacks, straight up.

15:06.990 --> 15:12.989
I think the one this week
is which alliance do I

15:12.990 --> 15:13.990
fracture.

15:13.991 --> 15:15.989
I'm going to tell people
right before the round you

15:15.990 --> 15:18.539
made a deal with me that you
promised me and the twins

15:18.540 --> 15:19.989
safety and I just said okay.

15:19.990 --> 15:20.990
Okay.

15:20.991 --> 15:22.989
That's why he isn't going up.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.119
Hell yeah.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.989
Right now I'm choosing to
be loyal to Megan James.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.989
Half of it is kind of an
insurance policy.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.989
I know James could
potentially win that hoh

15:31.990 --> 15:32.990
next week.

15:32.991 --> 15:34.989
We also just love hanging
out with Meg and James so

15:34.990 --> 15:38.989
that really leaves me with
either Vanessa, Steve or

15:38.990 --> 15:44.989
Johnnie mack as a target.

15:44.990 --> 15:47.989
I made a deal with him
before the games and...

15:47.990 --> 15:51.989
when Austin tells me that
I'm safe I'm feeling really

15:51.990 --> 15:53.989
good about it he has to the
given me or Meg any reason

15:53.990 --> 15:55.999
to doubt him at this time.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.989
We're all part of a team.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.539
We're trying to get down to
final five.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.989
I don't see him putting his
trust in Johnnie mack or

16:02.990 --> 16:02.991
Steve.

16:02.991 --> 16:07.989
And definitely not Vanessa.

16:07.990 --> 16:10.999
You got to do you what
got to do.

16:11.000 --> 16:11.990
Uh-huh.

16:11.991 --> 16:13.989
Things could get ugly.

16:13.990 --> 16:21.990
Could get real ugly.

16:23.990 --> 16:25.829
I think we're good.

16:25.830 --> 16:31.989
I mean we just made a...
>> they're probably going to...

16:31.990 --> 16:35.989
they'll be one of the three.

16:35.990 --> 16:39.989
I think we're good though.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.989
I was on the block last
week, me and Steve made this

16:43.990 --> 16:45.989
alliance with Austin and the
twins.

16:45.990 --> 16:49.989
I'm feeling safe with Austin
being hoh because of the

16:49.990 --> 16:50.990
deal.

16:50.991 --> 16:58.991
James is a bigger target
than me at this point.

17:00.990 --> 17:07.989
James is a bigger target
than me at this point.

17:07.990 --> 17:10.829
> I knew I could win.

17:10.830 --> 17:14.289
You can do... I have a
really good idea.

17:14.290 --> 17:17.989
But you need an hoh anyways.

17:17.990 --> 17:19.999
Vanessa, I know you have
big plans for this week.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.999
You have big plans for every
week.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
But news flash, you are not
running my hoh.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.989
> Already in my bed.

17:38.990 --> 17:40.999
Who do you think you're
going to put up.

17:41.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm not putting Meg and
James up.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.989
John or... or John and
Vanessa.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.989
By working with Meg and
James it keeps another dual

17:55.990 --> 17:56.990
in the game.

17:56.991 --> 17:58.989
If one of them goes the
twins an I are exposed as

17:58.990 --> 18:01.989
the next likely victims.

18:01.990 --> 18:04.989
If I take out Meg or
James it is a huge betrayal.

18:04.990 --> 18:05.990
I like them.

18:05.991 --> 18:10.119
The only people I don't have
fun with really are, well,

18:10.120 --> 18:10.990
Vanessa.

18:10.991 --> 18:14.989
What are you doing.

18:14.990 --> 18:16.699
Bam.

18:16.700 --> 18:17.989
Here's my idea.

18:17.990 --> 18:19.989
It's a little tricky okay
but the only way I think you

18:19.990 --> 18:23.989
get no blood on your hands
except for Johnnie macks,

18:23.990 --> 18:28.989
putting Johnnie mack on the
block you could get pov and

18:28.990 --> 18:30.989
could pull himself off which
is bad.

18:30.990 --> 18:33.999
So set it up for a situation
where he will throw it if he

18:34.000 --> 18:39.989
does play, we don't put him
on the block.

18:39.990 --> 18:42.989
I think I can convince
him even if he is on the

18:42.990 --> 18:50.989
block that he can let one of
us win it and take him off.

18:50.990 --> 18:54.989
I would have to pup...
>> if you put Johnnie mack

18:54.990 --> 18:58.989
done within dns he barely
wanted to play last week.

18:58.990 --> 19:00.119
He's laying to you.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.989
He's very loyal to...
>> es he a numbers guys.

19:03.990 --> 19:05.989
Why would he go against four
people.

19:05.990 --> 19:06.990
I will tell you something.

19:06.991 --> 19:09.289
This is not to leave this ram.

19:09.290 --> 19:17.290
Okay.

19:20.990 --> 19:21.990
> Really?

19:21.991 --> 19:23.699
This information means
nothing to me.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.989
But the fact that Vanessa
didn't tell me sooner means

19:26.990 --> 19:29.989
either a, she's lying or b,
she's noti

19:29.990 --> 19:32.989
everything that she's doing
in this house.

19:32.990 --> 19:34.989
That changes the
assessment, you know.

19:34.990 --> 19:35.990
Okay.

19:35.991 --> 19:43.991
All right, that's good stuff.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.989
So let's get down to
brass tacks.

19:52.990 --> 19:53.990
Brass tacks.

19:53.991 --> 19:55.989
I am trying to think what
is the safest way to get all

19:55.990 --> 19:57.989
of us to final fair at this
point.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.989
Don't want to put you up at all.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.699
I like you guys better than
anyone else and don't want

20:03.700 --> 20:05.989
you to have a chance for
going home.

20:05.990 --> 20:07.989
The one way was Steve and
Johnnie mack.

20:07.990 --> 20:11.989
The other thing I'm thinking
too for me is like who is

20:11.990 --> 20:14.989
going to be least likely to
hold a grudge if they came

20:14.990 --> 20:15.990
right back.

20:15.991 --> 20:17.989
Probably Johnnie mack.

20:17.990 --> 20:18.990
Yes.

20:18.991 --> 20:20.989
But he's probably least
likely to come back so I

20:20.990 --> 20:23.989
want to make it just the
right move.

20:23.990 --> 20:29.289
I feel like she's... every
week she tries to get out

20:29.290 --> 20:30.989
who she wants to get out.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.989
And honestly, she's done
that every week.

20:33.990 --> 20:36.119
Yeah, uh-huh.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.289
Right.

20:37.290 --> 20:39.989
So here's the thing, Steve
and Johnnie mack go up,

20:39.990 --> 20:42.989
Johnnie mack gets... and she
is go up, or I need you to

20:42.990 --> 20:45.989
be the pawn, Vanessa, put
her up with Steve an back

20:45.990 --> 20:48.699
door generallie mack, there
are a lot of things.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.989
Taking out Vanessa is
such a difficult decision

20:50.990 --> 20:53.989
because down in my gut I
still think that she's

20:53.990 --> 20:55.989
working with me more than
anyone else.

20:55.990 --> 20:58.989
If I were to take her out
now I could be killing a

20:58.990 --> 20:59.999
real number for me.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.949
The thing is Vanessa has
had a hand in every single

21:03.950 --> 21:05.989
he vurx... eviction pretty
much so far.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.989
I think that's absolutely right.

21:07.990 --> 21:08.990
And even this week.

21:08.991 --> 21:10.989
Becky was kind of her target.

21:10.990 --> 21:14.989
100 percent she got what
she wanted.

21:14.990 --> 21:16.999
Honestly, I'm not sure
that she is necessarily

21:17.000 --> 21:20.989
coming at me right away, so
that is am I making a

21:20.990 --> 21:22.989
mistake to take her when
Johnnie mack might put me

21:22.990 --> 21:23.990
up.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.989
I feel she is in a position
where she has to work with

21:25.990 --> 21:26.990
all of us.

21:26.991 --> 21:29.949
If you back door Vanessa
what could you even say,

21:29.950 --> 21:31.539
like there would be so much
to say.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.989
That's the thing I'm
thinking numberswise.

21:33.990 --> 21:34.990
Yeah.

21:34.991 --> 21:36.989
It might not be my best
interest to do it.

21:36.990 --> 21:37.990
Yeah.

21:37.991 --> 21:42.989
But if she talks any more
it's like I will wajted to

21:42.990 --> 21:43.990
do it.

21:43.991 --> 21:45.289
Even though it seems
Johnnie mack would be an

21:45.290 --> 21:47.989
easy target to get rid of
this week without ruining my

21:47.990 --> 21:49.989
position in the house the
more we talk out the things

21:49.990 --> 21:52.989
that Vanessa has said and
done in this game, the more

21:52.990 --> 21:56.829
I'm realizing that maybe I
need to take her out.

21:56.830 --> 22:00.289
It's kind of like the kid
that is not supposed to eat

22:00.290 --> 22:04.989
the cook... cookie but I want
to eat the cook-year.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.699
Don't push push but you
really want to push it.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.989
It is going to be... holy
hell.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.120
It would be just a
meltdown of the century

22:28.990 --> 22:30.990
come in.

22:36.990 --> 22:39.989
I wanted to talk to
everyone before I make any

22:39.990 --> 22:40.990
decisions kind of thing.

22:40.990 --> 22:41.990
Okay.

22:41.991 --> 22:43.989
Because it is tough there
are only so many numbers I

22:43.990 --> 22:45.989
am able to pick from, basically.

22:45.990 --> 22:46.999
Right.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.989
So I'm trying to see that
I can do that is the least

22:49.990 --> 22:49.991
damaging.

22:49.991 --> 22:50.990
Right.

22:50.991 --> 22:53.289
Any suggestions?

22:53.290 --> 22:56.539
You got to minimize the
blood on your hands.

22:56.540 --> 23:02.989
They just know that I... want
to put them up.

23:02.990 --> 23:03.999
You told Meg that.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.989
I told Meg and James, you
and the twins, before the

23:05.990 --> 23:06.990
final.

23:06.991 --> 23:09.989
I'm telling Vanessa I
made a deal with James and

23:09.990 --> 23:11.989
Meg during the last round of
this hoh.

23:11.990 --> 23:15.289
She has no idea that in
reality we made this deal

23:15.290 --> 23:16.989
last week.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.949
Sorry Vanessa.

23:18.950 --> 23:22.989
So the only person left
is Johnnie mack.

23:22.990 --> 23:23.990
Uh-huh.

23:23.991 --> 23:26.989
Okay, so you are saying
you want to put him up.

23:26.990 --> 23:27.999
Potentially.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.989
I'm telling Vanessa my
target is Johnny Mac this

23:30.990 --> 23:31.990
week.

23:31.990 --> 23:32.990
And that say half truth.

23:32.991 --> 23:34.289
However I might want to
target her.

23:34.290 --> 23:36.989
So if you put Johnnie
mack up you need a pawn.

23:36.990 --> 23:38.989
But the problem is the
pawn has to come from this

23:38.990 --> 23:39.990
room.

23:39.991 --> 23:42.829
Obviously you guys aren't
going to go... it has to be

23:42.830 --> 23:45.989
you or me and it makes the
most sense, I mean you are

23:45.990 --> 23:48.989
close to Johnnie mack so you
would be a vote for him as

23:48.990 --> 23:51.989
opposed to...
>> back up, you lost me.

23:51.990 --> 23:55.989
So I mean I'm assuming
that Liz is not going to be

23:55.990 --> 23:58.409
the pawn so I think it is
going to be you and me if

23:58.410 --> 23:59.410
there has to be a pawn.

23:59.411 --> 24:01.989
I would do t here would be
the problem, it would

24:01.990 --> 24:04.989
require you agreeing to vote
against Johnnie mack if it

24:04.990 --> 24:05.990
came down to it.

24:05.991 --> 24:08.539
You want to make sure if you
are going to take the shot

24:08.540 --> 24:09.540
you hit.

24:09.540 --> 24:09.990
Got it.

24:09.991 --> 24:13.989
You see what I'm saying.

24:13.990 --> 24:14.990
I do.

24:14.990 --> 24:15.990
Yeah.

24:15.991 --> 24:17.989
So I don't know, I guess
I have to decide who

24:17.990 --> 24:20.989
the... if I were to do that,
what pawn to put up.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.989
If Steve doesn't... I don't
know if Steve feels

24:23.990 --> 24:24.999
comfortable with that the or
not.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.119
How do you feel about it, Steve.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.699
Generally not good about pawns.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.989
Vanessa, I don't
understand what your problem

24:31.990 --> 24:33.989
is pawns go home in this game.

24:33.990 --> 24:34.990
I don't want to do this.

24:34.991 --> 24:38.989
Will you please stop putting
me in this position.

24:38.990 --> 24:43.999
Right, okay, okay.

24:44.000 --> 24:51.699
> This is horrible wrning.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.989
I feel like you're not
feeling... dow want to talk

24:53.990 --> 24:55.989
to me alone or something?

24:55.990 --> 24:58.989
Could we?

24:58.990 --> 25:06.990
Yeah, get up for a minute
and try to figure it out.

25:08.410 --> 25:09.410
She's good.

25:09.411 --> 25:10.829
She's good, man.

25:10.830 --> 25:13.829
She already decided I was
coming before she walked in

25:13.830 --> 25:14.989
the door.

25:14.990 --> 25:15.990
No, I want to talk to you
straight up, I'm not going

25:15.991 --> 25:18.989
to play her game, dude, I'm
not losing you.

25:18.990 --> 25:20.989
I am not going to do it.

25:20.990 --> 25:21.990
She tried to back door you.

25:21.990 --> 25:22.990
I know.

25:22.991 --> 25:24.409
And this is what she does
every week.

25:24.410 --> 25:26.409
She has a target, she does this.

25:26.410 --> 25:27.989
She comes up with new
information last minute that

25:27.990 --> 25:30.989
she hasn't shared with me
yet but all of a sudden it

25:30.990 --> 25:32.989
is convenient for her to
share the information.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.989
Shelli told me before she
left that Johnnie mack told

25:35.990 --> 25:39.989
Clay that he has a final two
deal with Steve.

25:39.990 --> 25:42.989
And she is like that is why
we can't trust Steve.

25:42.990 --> 25:45.989
So if he happens to go, oh well.

25:45.990 --> 25:48.989
Can I tell you something,
Johnnie mack and I don't

25:48.990 --> 25:49.990
have a final two.

25:49.991 --> 25:51.539
I didn't think you did.

25:51.540 --> 25:52.829
We don't, period.

25:52.830 --> 25:53.700
And I believe you.

25:53.701 --> 25:54.989
You don't even have to
convince me.

25:54.990 --> 25:56.699
I never said final two.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.989
The truth of the matter
is, am I working with John,

25:58.990 --> 25:59.830
yes.

25:59.831 --> 26:00.989
Am I close with him, yes.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.989
Did I ever agree to go to
the final two with him?

26:03.990 --> 26:05.989
No.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.989
Kind of screwed because I
feel like I have been put in

26:08.990 --> 26:10.989
this position where I'm
aligned with everyone in the

26:10.990 --> 26:11.990
house.

26:11.990 --> 26:12.990
But not by your choice.

26:12.991 --> 26:15.989
But not really by my
choice and now it's happened

26:15.990 --> 26:19.289
and I don't know... I mean I
have have half a mind to put

26:19.290 --> 26:25.989
my top hat on and says hey,
juddas says you take a seat

26:25.990 --> 26:27.999
on that block and go nuts.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.989
What do you think I
should do then?

26:29.990 --> 26:33.119
You think putting you and
Johnnie mack would be a

26:33.120 --> 26:33.990
terrible decision.

26:33.990 --> 26:34.990
I don't want to go up.

26:34.990 --> 26:35.990
I know you don't.

26:35.990 --> 26:36.990
I do not want to go up.

26:36.990 --> 26:37.990
I know.

26:37.991 --> 26:39.989
If you really don't feel
comfortable as a pawn we

26:39.990 --> 26:41.539
will figure something else out.

26:41.540 --> 26:43.989
Right now the only thing
certain is that Johnnie mack

26:43.990 --> 26:45.989
will go up on that block.

26:45.990 --> 26:50.989
Who is going next to him, I
don't know.

26:50.990 --> 26:51.990
It's my hoh.

26:51.991 --> 26:54.989
I will put the top hat on
and do what I have to do.

26:54.990 --> 26:57.989
I want to you do what is
best for you and what is the

26:57.990 --> 27:00.119
best for those girls.

27:00.120 --> 27:08.120
I know.

27:08.990 --> 27:10.989
So he didn't want to go
up as a pawn.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.699
He does not want to do it.

27:12.700 --> 27:13.949
So now I'm caught.

27:13.950 --> 27:16.989
Do I ask you to be a pawn,
what do I do?

27:16.990 --> 27:19.829
Imagine how funny it
would look if you put me up.

27:19.830 --> 27:21.989
Johnnie mack is going to
know he is a backup target.

27:21.990 --> 27:23.989
He doesn't know you are
close to them.

27:23.990 --> 27:27.989
What do you do if you win veto.

27:27.990 --> 27:30.989
Do you really have to do
Johnnie mack, really.

27:30.990 --> 27:31.990
Yes.

27:31.990 --> 27:32.990
We don't have a final two
with him.

27:32.991 --> 27:34.699
You don't have a final two.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.699
No.

27:36.700 --> 27:36.990
Okay.

27:36.991 --> 27:38.989
But you are closer to him
than me.

27:38.990 --> 27:39.990
Yes.

27:39.990 --> 27:40.990
Okay.

27:40.991 --> 27:42.989
I'm just really not
comfortable being a pawn.

27:42.990 --> 27:44.989
We all need to be willing
to be pawns at some point.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.989
If we're not there is no
point in being aligned.

27:47.990 --> 27:50.989
Then you don't trust each other.

27:50.990 --> 27:52.699
I need a drink.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.989
I'm watching Vanessa just
go off on Steve.

27:54.990 --> 27:57.989
And this is hysterical
...Hysterical to me.

27:57.990 --> 27:59.989
News flash you also don't
want to be a pawn for the

27:59.990 --> 28:02.989
same reason he does, you
don't sound like a loyal

28:02.990 --> 28:04.989
alliance member yourself
what are you doing.

28:04.990 --> 28:07.699
I think it's dumb, no
matter what we have the

28:07.700 --> 28:11.829
votes to keep each other so
we're arguing over spilt

28:11.830 --> 28:12.949
milk.

28:12.950 --> 28:14.989
I hurt my own game in
such a big way to keep you

28:14.990 --> 28:16.409
here and you know that.

28:16.410 --> 28:18.999
Ask Liz or Julia, I can't
remember which one, how much

28:19.000 --> 28:21.989
sleep I lost that night
trying to strategize a way

28:21.990 --> 28:24.949
to keep you, going through
that wasn't on you, and you

28:24.950 --> 28:26.989
know that.

28:26.990 --> 28:27.990
Was it, okay.

28:27.990 --> 28:28.990
You said was it?

28:28.990 --> 28:28.991
Yeah.

28:28.991 --> 28:30.989
I thought it was, you lied.

28:30.990 --> 28:31.990
Yeah, I know.

28:31.990 --> 28:32.990
You know what I mean.

28:32.991 --> 28:35.989
And that is what I went on.

28:35.990 --> 28:38.989
Couple weeks ago Vanessa
was hoh and part of a major

28:38.990 --> 28:39.990
plan to back door me.

28:39.991 --> 28:43.829
She had basically hired
James to throw the battle of

28:43.830 --> 28:46.699
the block when he was
sitting next to Liz.

28:46.700 --> 28:47.989
Thank you, James.

28:47.990 --> 28:49.989
I need her to confess to this.

28:49.990 --> 28:52.989
So is the plan for Liz
and James to stay on the

28:52.990 --> 28:53.990
block?

28:53.990 --> 28:54.990
Was that the whole plan then.

28:54.991 --> 28:56.829
It was.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.989
Were they supposed to be
on the block and somehow Liz

28:58.990 --> 28:59.540
won that.

28:59.541 --> 29:01.289
As far as I know, yes.

29:01.290 --> 29:04.989
As far as I know, I put
up strong people.

29:04.990 --> 29:05.950
Thinking they would win.

29:05.951 --> 29:06.989
Yes.

29:06.990 --> 29:08.989
She thought James through
it, you know.

29:08.990 --> 29:10.539
But he didn't, he said.

29:10.540 --> 29:10.990
In the end.

29:10.990 --> 29:11.990
I don't know.

29:11.991 --> 29:13.989
We don't know, we'll never know.

29:13.990 --> 29:14.950
Did you ask him.

29:14.951 --> 29:15.989
I never asked him.

29:15.990 --> 29:16.990
Do you think he threw it?

29:16.991 --> 29:18.989
I don't know.

29:18.990 --> 29:20.989
I don't know that, on their
side.

29:20.990 --> 29:21.990
But.

29:21.990 --> 29:22.990
Whatever.

29:22.991 --> 29:24.989
I know that Vanessa is
lying right now.

29:24.990 --> 29:27.119
James did throw that battle
of the block.

29:27.120 --> 29:30.989
Guess what, Vanessa, I can't
trust you any more.

29:30.990 --> 29:33.699
I will put the top hat on
and figure it out.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.989
Can I have three minutes
with you alone?

29:35.990 --> 29:36.990
No more.

29:36.991 --> 29:38.989
I just want to sit with
Liz for a second.

29:38.990 --> 29:40.539
I understand.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.989
Just like... all right.

29:42.990 --> 29:43.990
No problem.

29:43.991 --> 29:51.991
All right, I am going to go
to bed.

29:53.990 --> 29:57.289
Oh jeez, my leg is
completely and totally

29:57.290 --> 30:00.119
asleep.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.989
When she said you know
you deserve to go up, and I

30:03.990 --> 30:06.989
protected you that week,
you... the reason I can't be

30:06.990 --> 30:10.409
a pawn next to Johnnie mack
is I have two votes.

30:10.410 --> 30:12.989
I don't know if I have her vote.

30:12.990 --> 30:14.989
There we go, Steve, that
is what we want to hear.

30:14.990 --> 30:17.999
She is going to sit here
when I'm hoh to say I

30:18.000 --> 30:20.989
deserve to be back doored
because I lied to her.

30:20.990 --> 30:24.989
And she lied straight up
about the bop...

30:24.990 --> 30:27.409
I'm livid at Vanessa.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.989
She has the awe dos toilt
lie to me time and time

30:29.990 --> 30:33.989
again and now I'm stuck in
the most awkward hoh of the

30:33.990 --> 30:34.990
season.

30:34.991 --> 30:35.999
I'm willing to do what I
need to do.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.989
And if Vanessa needs to be
my target, then it's her

30:39.990 --> 30:40.990
time.

30:40.991 --> 30:46.989
Welcome to the imaganarium.

30:46.990 --> 30:48.990
Dow believe that, I'm done

31:14.990 --> 31:15.990
there we go.

31:15.990 --> 31:16.990
That was a good spot.

31:16.991 --> 31:20.989
You can come back.

31:20.990 --> 31:21.990
Do you like me?

31:21.991 --> 31:23.999
We like each other.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.989
I like you because you
cook delicious omelets.

31:27.990 --> 31:27.991
That's all?

31:27.991 --> 31:29.699
That's it.

31:29.700 --> 31:30.540
Okay.

31:30.541 --> 31:32.989
I know that I did not
like Austin at first.

31:32.990 --> 31:36.999
But now I like him.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.119
Yeah, I lake him.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.699
93%.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.409
I like that you are very
sensitive, very sweet, very

31:45.410 --> 31:45.990
caring.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.409
I like your soft skin a lot.

31:48.410 --> 31:52.989
I like your soft skin and
the fact that you don't have

31:52.990 --> 31:59.989
any back hair your honey
tail is growing on me.

31:59.990 --> 32:00.120
Oh really.

32:00.121 --> 32:01.699
I like your butt.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.989
I love your butt.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.989
I really like that you
have big muscles.

32:06.990 --> 32:12.989
You're a really good... and
you're a pretty good kisser.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.119
Oh, thank you.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.989
You're an amazing kisser.

32:15.990 --> 32:17.989
And you let me yell at you.

32:17.990 --> 32:18.700
Yes.

32:18.701 --> 32:21.989
I do.

32:21.990 --> 32:23.990
Because I'm not perfect.

32:32.990 --> 32:34.539
Who's there?

32:34.540 --> 32:40.989
May I...
>> yeah.

32:40.990 --> 32:43.989
Do you need anything from
me or anyway I can help?

32:43.990 --> 32:45.989
I don't know.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.989
I'm still trying to decide.

32:47.990 --> 32:52.989
Basically like it's either
I'm putting Vanessa up now

32:52.990 --> 32:55.989
or I leave her open for a
back door.

32:55.990 --> 32:57.989
That's what I'm trying to
decide.

32:57.990 --> 33:00.409
Because I don't want to go
back on my deal with Meg and

33:00.410 --> 33:00.990
James.

33:00.990 --> 33:01.990
Okay.

33:01.991 --> 33:03.989
At this point I'm going back
and forth between Steve and

33:03.990 --> 33:04.990
Vanessa.

33:04.991 --> 33:06.989
I can't keep them both safe.

33:06.990 --> 33:08.989
What does Judas do.

33:08.990 --> 33:11.989
Okay, your mind is made up.

33:11.990 --> 33:12.990
No, it is not.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.989
I have to decide who I am
putting up next to Johnnie

33:15.990 --> 33:16.990
mack, you know.

33:16.991 --> 33:19.989
I still might have to think
about putting you up even

33:19.990 --> 33:20.990
though I don't want to.

33:20.989 --> 33:21.989
I don't want to do that.

33:21.990 --> 33:23.989
So I don't know.

33:23.990 --> 33:26.989
Like I could just go with
her and she's going to be

33:26.990 --> 33:32.989
freaked out.

33:32.990 --> 33:36.989
If you need to use me as
a pawn I don't want to be

33:36.990 --> 33:41.989
next to Johnnie mack, that
is my request.

33:41.990 --> 33:45.989
I don't want to go up
next to Johnnie mack.

33:45.990 --> 33:46.990
I know you don't.

33:46.991 --> 33:49.949
If you need to put me up,
do it next to Vanessa.

33:49.950 --> 33:51.989
Why are you so opposed to
going up against Johnnie

33:51.990 --> 33:52.990
mack.

33:52.991 --> 33:54.989
Because that is telling
me you are with Meg and

33:54.990 --> 33:55.990
James and not me and him.

33:55.991 --> 33:57.989
No way, oh my God.

33:57.990 --> 34:00.989
See I trust you more than
I trust them.

34:00.990 --> 34:02.989
That's just it, but you
understand, when you put me

34:02.990 --> 34:04.989
and Johnnie mack up next to
each other.

34:04.990 --> 34:07.989
But the thing is if I
don't put you up, they are

34:07.990 --> 34:09.699
automatically knowing we're
together.

34:09.700 --> 34:12.409
I think it's interesting
interest that James and Meg

34:12.410 --> 34:14.989
are not even open for
discussion but this alliance

34:14.990 --> 34:16.989
we have is open to debate.

34:16.990 --> 34:19.289
I don't understand what he
is thinking or going after

34:19.290 --> 34:21.989
but I don't think I'm as
tight with Austin as I

34:21.990 --> 34:22.990
thought.

34:22.991 --> 34:24.989
This situation, I'm
damned if I do, damned if I

34:24.990 --> 34:25.990
don't.

34:25.991 --> 34:27.989
I don't trust them more than
you.

34:27.990 --> 34:30.989
Just don't put me up next
to Johnnie mack.

34:30.990 --> 34:32.989
I'm starting to get
really frustrated.

34:32.990 --> 34:33.990
Steve, just give me this.

34:33.991 --> 34:35.409
I'm dying here.

34:35.410 --> 34:37.989
I'm stuck in the worst
situation ever.

34:37.990 --> 34:39.989
I was hoping that you
would be understanding if I

34:39.990 --> 34:41.989
had to do it.

34:41.990 --> 34:44.949
But it's like if you are's
not understanding of it,

34:44.950 --> 34:52.950
there's no point in doing it.

34:52.990 --> 34:53.410
Right.

34:53.411 --> 34:55.949
Is yeah.

34:55.950 --> 34:57.699
I wish you luck,
Mr. Austin.

34:57.700 --> 34:58.989
Thank you.

34:58.990 --> 35:02.989
Bye Steve.

35:02.990 --> 35:05.699
Wait, can you tell me
it's not going to be me next

35:05.700 --> 35:05.990
to John.

35:05.990 --> 35:06.990
Yes.

35:06.991 --> 35:14.991
Okay, thank you well,
what do you think?

35:16.990 --> 35:24.990
Steve,... within he's
pissing me off.

35:26.990 --> 35:34.990
Steve,... within he's
pissing me off.

35:35.990 --> 35:36.990
He's so out of it.

35:36.990 --> 35:37.990
Out of what.

35:37.991 --> 35:40.989
I don't want to be up
next to Johnnie mack.

35:40.990 --> 35:42.989
The fact that Steve
doesn't want to be a pawn

35:42.990 --> 35:50.990
next to Johnnie mack is very
alarming and it says a lot.

35:52.990 --> 35:54.989
If it were safe, do it.

35:54.990 --> 35:56.989
They that I have your back.

35:56.990 --> 35:59.989
He needs to know that you
have his back too.

35:59.990 --> 36:01.119
I told him.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.989
Okay.

36:02.990 --> 36:05.989
I know Liz and Julia have
my back in this game because

36:05.990 --> 36:08.409
they know I've always looked
out for them.

36:08.410 --> 36:10.989
And I get the strong feeling
that they know that Austin

36:10.990 --> 36:14.119
is leaning towards saving
Steve and putting me up as a

36:14.120 --> 36:15.829
pawn.

36:15.830 --> 36:17.989
I getter get to the hoh room,
handle things with Austin or

36:17.990 --> 36:19.989
I will be the ones going up
as a pawn.

36:19.990 --> 36:27.990
You have to go through...
>> Steve will not play ball.

36:29.990 --> 36:36.989
You have to go through...
>> Steve will not play ball.

36:36.990 --> 36:40.989
He says if if I put uphill
and Johnnie mack, he knows

36:40.990 --> 36:43.989
I'm closer with Meg and
James than him and Johnnie

36:43.990 --> 36:46.989
mack.

36:46.990 --> 36:49.829
And there knows the trust.

36:49.830 --> 36:51.289
Send him and Johnnie mack
who is at least loyal.

36:51.290 --> 36:53.989
I mean I don't know f
someone is going to threaten

36:53.990 --> 36:56.989
you that way, that is not
the way you play in a team,

36:56.990 --> 36:57.990
I'm sorry.

36:57.991 --> 36:59.829
One of them told me that
Steve had said he didn't

36:59.830 --> 37:02.409
care about going up on the
block next to me but cared

37:02.410 --> 37:04.699
about going on the block
next to Johnnie mackment

37:04.700 --> 37:06.289
that should tell you
something, that means

37:06.290 --> 37:09.119
they're the closest am which
means you can't rely on his

37:09.120 --> 37:12.989
vote if I end up next to
Johnnie mack, you know you

37:12.990 --> 37:13.990
are relying on that.

37:13.991 --> 37:16.989
I'm relying on Meg and James.

37:16.990 --> 37:19.949
Instead I am going home
and it will be the dumbest

37:19.950 --> 37:21.989
move because quite frackly
you have someone connected

37:21.990 --> 37:24.989
to no one in the house but
y'all.

37:24.990 --> 37:26.989
I am willing to be a pawn
but this would not be the

37:26.990 --> 37:27.990
spot for it.

37:27.991 --> 37:29.989
So what do I do then?

37:29.990 --> 37:31.989
Someone please tell me what
to do?

37:31.990 --> 37:35.989
Okay, let me... can I talk
to Vanessa for a second

37:35.990 --> 37:36.410
alone.

37:36.411 --> 37:42.989
I want to figure this out, okay.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.989
Okay, so the one thing I
need to know because this

37:44.990 --> 37:47.119
keeps coming up and I
haven't thought it out with

37:47.120 --> 37:50.989
the girls, did you know
because everyone has told me

37:50.990 --> 37:56.989
that you know, did you know
that James was the thrower

37:56.990 --> 37:57.990
with Liz.

37:57.990 --> 37:57.991
Yes.

37:57.991 --> 37:58.990
So you did know.

37:58.991 --> 38:00.409
Yes, I did know.

38:00.410 --> 38:01.290
Okay.

38:01.291 --> 38:02.989
Austin, I thought you lied
to me.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.989
That was the only moment in
this game I thought that.

38:05.990 --> 38:07.989
And I was so hurt.

38:07.990 --> 38:11.829
You know how up set I was
when you lied to me.

38:11.830 --> 38:15.949
I didn't know... I thought
you told when you lied to me

38:15.950 --> 38:16.989
I was so confused.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.989
I thought you were working
against me.

38:18.990 --> 38:19.990
That's what I thought.

38:19.990 --> 38:20.990
I know, I know.

38:20.990 --> 38:21.990
I did.

38:21.991 --> 38:23.829
In that moment, can't you
remember like that moment

38:23.830 --> 38:27.989
where we had this, I saw
that look and I realized oh

38:27.990 --> 38:28.990
my God, how wrong I was.

38:28.990 --> 38:29.990
I know.

38:29.990 --> 38:30.990
I felt terrible.

38:30.991 --> 38:34.829
We had a moment but there
were two days of hell that

38:34.830 --> 38:35.989
still burns if me.

38:35.990 --> 38:36.990
I made a mistake.

38:36.991 --> 38:38.289
Vanessa has come clean to me.

38:38.290 --> 38:40.999
But can I trust her or is
this another game move on

38:41.000 --> 38:43.989
her part this is a
make-or-break decision for

38:43.990 --> 38:44.290
me.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.989
I need to decide what to do.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.539
I'm totally flipping a
coin on it with you and

38:48.540 --> 38:49.949
Steve.

38:49.950 --> 38:50.989
All I can do is give you
my word I'm loyal to you.

38:50.990 --> 38:54.539
We had our... in the past and
it made us stronger and I'm

38:54.540 --> 38:54.990
so sorry.

38:54.991 --> 38:56.539
That's all I can say.

38:56.540 --> 38:57.989
Will you kill me if I put
you up.

38:57.990 --> 38:59.989
You have to do what is
right for you, man.

38:59.990 --> 39:01.119
Oh my God.

39:01.120 --> 39:01.990
I understand.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.990
I understand

39:28.990 --> 39:31.000
time for the nomination
ceremony.

39:46.990 --> 39:49.989
This is the nomination ceremony.

39:49.990 --> 39:52.989
It is my responsibility as
the head of household to

39:52.990 --> 39:54.119
nominate two house guests
for eviction.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.999
I will turn two keys to lock
in my nominations, and their

39:58.000 --> 39:59.989
faces will appear on the
memory wall.

39:59.990 --> 40:07.990
The first house guest that I
have nominated is:.

40:12.990 --> 40:20.990
The next house guest that I
have nominated is:.

40:22.990 --> 40:30.989
The next house guest that I
have nominated is:.

40:30.990 --> 40:33.989
I'm conflicted, as a
human being I've always been

40:33.990 --> 40:34.990
conflicted.

40:34.991 --> 40:36.409
I think that life is
meaningless and important at

40:36.410 --> 40:37.290
the same time.

40:37.291 --> 40:39.119
It's meaningless base we're
all going to die.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.989
But it's important because
we're living.

40:40.990 --> 40:42.989
We can love.

40:42.990 --> 40:45.989
And I can quest for knowledge.

40:45.990 --> 40:46.990
Because knowledge is power,
right?

40:46.991 --> 40:49.989
Well, unfortunately, those
in power say what knowledge

40:49.990 --> 40:50.990
is.

40:50.991 --> 40:52.989
Especially here.

40:52.990 --> 40:55.989
In week five I was supposed
to be eliminated from this

40:55.990 --> 40:56.990
game.

40:56.991 --> 41:01.989
My fate was sealed, and if
it wasn't for her winning a

41:01.990 --> 41:04.539
competition all by herself,
I wouldn't be here and I

41:04.540 --> 41:06.949
would have no decisions to make.

41:06.950 --> 41:09.989
So now I'm not thinking just
for myself, I'm thinking

41:09.990 --> 41:10.990
about her too.

41:10.991 --> 41:13.989
And I'm in an impossible
situation this week.

41:13.990 --> 41:16.989
Johnnie mack, Steve, you
were not a part of what

41:16.990 --> 41:17.990
happened to me that week.

41:17.991 --> 41:19.989
So why are you guys on the
block.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.829
You're victims just like I am.

41:21.830 --> 41:26.989
But unfortunately life,
victims aren't we all.

41:26.990 --> 41:28.989
So.

41:28.990 --> 41:34.989
This nomination ceremony
is adjourned.

41:34.990 --> 41:36.989
Austin being in the big
brother house for 60

41:36.990 --> 41:39.989
something days I think you
have finally lost your mind,

41:39.990 --> 41:40.990
man.

41:40.991 --> 41:43.989
I think that'sed craziest
nomination speech I've ever

41:43.990 --> 41:44.990
heard.

41:44.991 --> 41:47.119
I think you need to go to
the puzzle factory, man.

41:47.120 --> 41:52.119
I am in awe of Vanessa
not going up today.

41:52.120 --> 41:57.829
I don't know what she did, I
don't know how she did it

41:57.830 --> 42:00.989
but Vanessa is a phenomenal,
phenomenal player and I have

42:00.990 --> 42:03.119
to applaud her for that.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.989
Two weeks in a row I'm on
the block against someone I

42:06.990 --> 42:09.289
don't want to see go home
but my back is against the

42:09.290 --> 42:10.539
wall.

42:10.540 --> 42:13.119
One of us has to win a veto
and we have to turn this

42:13.120 --> 42:13.990
thing around.

42:13.991 --> 42:18.989
I am shocked and so utederly
grateful.

42:18.990 --> 42:19.990
I really thought I was going up.

42:19.991 --> 42:22.989
But at the end of the day,
Austin and I do have each

42:22.990 --> 42:24.989
other's back and have come
very far together in this

42:24.990 --> 42:26.989
game.

42:26.990 --> 42:30.539
This has been the hardest
hoh of the season.

42:30.540 --> 42:32.989
The back door option is
still open for Vanessa but

42:32.990 --> 42:36.989
it's a matter of timing and
no numbers and I'm not sure

42:36.990 --> 42:39.989
yet if this is the rate week
for her to go.

42:39.990 --> 42:42.989
Who will win the power of
veto and will be it used to

42:42.990 --> 42:46.409
save either John or Steve
from eviction.

42:46.410 --> 42:49.989
