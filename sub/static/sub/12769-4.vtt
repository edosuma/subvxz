00:22.834 --> 00:25.333
CURTAIN THREE.
DR. WILDER IS ON CALL.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.041
GOT IT.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.750
(door hisses)

00:28.792 --> 00:30.750
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
IS THE BABY OKAY?

00:30.792 --> 00:33.542
THAT'S WHY I PAGED
DR. MONTGOMERY.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.458
THIS IS ELANA STONE.
SHE'S 33 YEARS OLD, 22 WEEKS.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.041
(whimpering)
PRESENTED WITH DIFFUSE PAIN

00:38.083 --> 00:40.667
LOCALIZED MORE
IN THE ABDOMINAL AREA.
(cries) I THINK
I'M HAVING A MISCARRIAGE.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.458
OKAY, ELANA,

00:42.500 --> 00:45.041
I'M GONNA DO AN ULTRASOUND, TRY
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.458
SHE'S HAD CHRONIC PAIN
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS,

00:47.500 --> 00:50.333
SENSITIVITY TO TOUCH,
MIGRAINES.
SEVEN DOCTORS,
NO ONE COULD FIND ANYTHING.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.041
OW!
ELANA, I NEED YOU TO HANG IN
A LITTLE LONGER, OKAY?

00:53.083 --> 00:55.792
OKAY.
OKAY.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.041
OW! (crying)

00:57.083 --> 00:58.250
OW!

00:58.291 --> 01:00.375
IS OUR BABY OKAY?
(groaning)

01:00.417 --> 01:02.083
HE LOOKS JUST FINE.

01:02.125 --> 01:04.041
BUT THE PAIN...

01:04.083 --> 01:06.625
LATELY EVEN BREATHING'S
BEEN HARD.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.667
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT THE PREGNANCY...

01:08.709 --> 01:11.291
OW!
IS EXACERBATING THE UNDERLYING
CONDITION. I'M SORRY.

01:11.333 --> 01:15.041
(sniffles) PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

01:15.083 --> 01:19.041
(crying)

01:19.083 --> 01:20.583
A CLUSTER OF
UNRELATED SYMPTOMS

01:20.625 --> 01:22.583
INCLUDING SEVERE PAIN
WITH NO OBVIOUS CAUSE?

01:22.625 --> 01:24.041
YOU THINK IT'S FIBROMYALGIA?

01:24.083 --> 01:26.792
I'VE HAD PATIENTS WITH IT
BEFORE, AND IT'S MADDENING.

01:26.834 --> 01:28.834
YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM
A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS,

01:28.875 --> 01:31.333
TREATMENT'S COMPLICATED.
YEAH, WE CAN'T GIVE HER
ANYTHING TOO STRONG

01:31.375 --> 01:34.834
OVER THE LONG TERM.
IT'LL HURT THE BABY.
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS
CAN WORK.

01:34.875 --> 01:37.667
THAT'D BE GREAT IF WE HAD TIME,
BUT SHE NEEDS HELP RIGHT NOW.

01:37.709 --> 01:41.041
WELL, IF WE CAN'T GIVE HER MEDS
AND ALTERNATIVES ARE TOO SLOW,

01:41.083 --> 01:43.875
THEN WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

01:43.917 --> 01:46.750
(elevator bell dings)

01:46.792 --> 01:49.750
YEAH. THANK YOU.

01:49.792 --> 01:52.208
(gasps) BETSEY. HI.

01:52.250 --> 01:55.542
HI. IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.542
I'M MONICA BRATTON,
BETSEY'S AUNT.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.333
HI. I-I'M VIOLET TURNER.

01:59.375 --> 02:02.125
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
WE ALL ARE.

02:02.166 --> 02:04.959
YOU KNOW, DELL WAS...
HE--HE WAS FAMILY.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.041
I SPOKE TO A DR. FREEDMAN
ON THE PHONE

02:07.083 --> 02:09.166
WHEN BETSEY FIRST CAME
TO LIVE WITH ME.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.166
HE SAID IF WE EVER NEEDED
ANYTHING, TO BE IN TOUCH.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.959
YES. UH, HE--WELL, HE'S WITH
A PATIENT RIGHT NOW.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.709
WOULD--WOULD YOU LIKE--
I SUPPOSE
I COULD JUST TELL YOU.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.542
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE KIDS. IT'S
A CHOICE I MADE A LONG TIME AGO.

02:19.583 --> 02:21.583
UH, YES. I-I UNDERSTAND.
IT CAN BE A BIG ADJUSTMENT,

02:21.625 --> 02:24.667
BUT SOMETIMES--
AND WHEN DELL DIED
AND I TOOK BETSEY IN,

02:24.709 --> 02:27.250
I DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.417
BUT I CAN'T KEEP HER.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.083
(clicks button)

02:46.667 --> 02:49.625
IS IT WRONG THAT I WANT
TO PUNCH AUNT MONICA?

02:49.667 --> 02:52.750
ON SEVERAL LEVELS,
BUT SO DO I.

02:52.792 --> 02:55.125
LOOK, DESPITE WHAT IS CLEARLY
A LIMITED EMOTIONAL CAPACITY,

02:55.166 --> 02:58.959
I THINK AUNT MONICA DID WHAT
SHE THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR BETSEY.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.583
COME ON. SHE LEFT HER IN
OUR OFFICE LIKE PADDINGTON BEAR.

03:01.625 --> 03:04.041
THE ONLY THING MISSING WAS
A NOTE PINNED TO HER JACKET.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.041
SHE BROUGHT HER BACK TO THE ONLY
FAMILY THAT SHE HAS LEFT.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.959
BUT WE'RE NOT HER FAMILY.
SHE NEEDS NAOMI.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.041
WELL, NAI WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO REALLY BONDED WITH BETSEY.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.667
DELL AND BETSEY
LIVED WITH HER.
WELL, SHE'S AWAY

03:14.709 --> 03:16.792
ON FOUNDATION BUSINESS
FOR THE NEXT MONTH, SO...

03:16.834 --> 03:19.583
MAYBE WE COULD TAKE HER HOME
FOR A COUPLE NIGHTS?

03:19.625 --> 03:21.458
SHE'S NOT A PUPPY, COOPER.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.458
THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN
AND FAMILY SERVICES

03:23.500 --> 03:26.041
IS SET UP
FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

03:26.083 --> 03:29.458
YOU KNOW, I-I HAVE A FRIEND--
WE'RE NOT PLACING BETSEY
IN THE SYSTEM.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.417
EVERYBODY IN HER LIFE
HAS ABANDONED HER.
THEY DIED, VIOLET.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.041
I UNDERSTAND THAT, CHARLOTTE,
BUT IN HER MIND, THEY--
THE SYSTEM IS THERE TO PROTECT
KIDS EXACTLY LIKE BETSEY.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.792
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,
IT STILL SCREWS THEM UP.

03:37.834 --> 03:40.458
EITHER WAY, BETSEY'S GONNA
HAVE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.834
HER MOTHER WAS AN ADDICT.
BOTH HER PARENTS ARE DEAD.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.458
BETSEY NEEDS--

03:44.500 --> 03:47.291
HELP. SHE NEEDS HELP, WHICH DELL
WOULD'VE GIVEN ANY ONE OF US

03:47.333 --> 03:49.709
WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT...

03:49.750 --> 03:52.625
IF HE WERE STILL ALIVE.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.250
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:59.291 --> 04:01.875
IT'S WORSE. I CAN'T...

04:01.917 --> 04:05.583
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME SOME DRUGS,
A SHOT, SOMETHING.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.709
UNFORTUNATELY, ANYTHING
STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP YOU

04:07.750 --> 04:09.875
WOULD WIND UP
HARMING THE BABY.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.041
SO WHAT,
SHE JUST HAS TO SUFFER?

04:12.083 --> 04:13.709
IF THE PREGNANCY'S
MAKING THIS WORSE,

04:13.750 --> 04:15.750
CAN'T YOU JUST
TAKE THE BABY OUT?
NO, THE BABY'S NOT VIABLE YET.

04:15.792 --> 04:18.125
BUT THERE ARE
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS

04:18.166 --> 04:20.333
THAT COULD HELP
FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR TERM.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.041
I WOULD BE WITH YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

04:23.083 --> 04:26.041
AND ONCE YOU DELIVER,
THE LEVEL OF PAIN MIGHT SUBSIDE.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.041
THAT'S ANOTHER
THREE AND A HALF MONTHS. NO.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.917
IF YOU CAN'T
TAKE AWAY THE PAIN,

04:31.959 --> 04:35.542
I CAN'T HAVE THIS BABY.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.583
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

04:40.250 --> 04:42.000
SHE CAN'T ABORT OUR BABY.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.083
ELANA'S IN AGONY.

04:46.125 --> 04:48.542
IF SHE DOESN'T FEEL
SHE CAN CARRY TO TERM--

04:48.583 --> 04:50.542
SHE DIDN'T WANT A KID.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.542
I PUSHED HER,
AND FINALLY SHE AGREED,

04:52.583 --> 04:55.542
BUT I'VE NEVER...
I'VE NEVER FELT MY SON KICK.

04:55.583 --> 05:00.709
ELANA WON'T LET ME TOUCH HER
BECAUSE OF THE PAIN, BUT...

05:00.750 --> 05:04.041
THAT'S MY BABY.

05:04.083 --> 05:07.917
AND I WON'T LET YOU KILL HIM.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.583
(door opens and closes)

05:13.166 --> 05:16.125
I'M NOT CRAPPING IN A CUP.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.583
(Cooper)
IT'S THE ONLY WAY

05:17.625 --> 05:19.583
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR STOMACH.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.500
I'M NOT DOING IT.

05:21.542 --> 05:24.166
OKAY.
HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH THEN?

05:24.208 --> 05:26.834
COME ON. EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT A STOMACHACHE

05:26.875 --> 05:28.834
IS THE BEST WAY
TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.125
YOU CAN'T PROVE IT.
YOU CAN'T DISPROVE IT.

05:31.166 --> 05:34.166
WHY ARE YOU FAKING?
BUT I'M NOT FAKING--

05:34.208 --> 05:36.625
AH, TH--IT'S THE TRUTH
OR THE CUP.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.542
YOUR CHOICE.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.166
ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S THESE KIDS AT SCHOOL.

05:44.208 --> 05:47.166
AND THEY DON'T REALLY LIKE
THE STUFF THAT I'M INTO,

05:47.208 --> 05:49.166
SO THEY DO THINGS TO ME.
LIKE?

05:49.208 --> 05:52.041
LIKE I HAD PICTURES
IN MY LOCKER,

05:52.083 --> 05:54.959
AND THEN THEY TORE THEM DOWN.
I'M ASSUMING THEY WEREN'T
PICTURES OF GIRLS.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.250
ANIME.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.417
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE--

05:58.458 --> 06:00.333
CARTOONS, YEAH.
PEOPLE WITH BIG EYES

06:00.375 --> 06:01.917
AND IMPOSSIBLE-TO-PRONOUNCE
NAMES.

06:01.959 --> 06:05.667
WELL, THEY'RE JAPANESE FANTASY
AND ACTION ANIMATIONS, BUT...

06:05.709 --> 06:08.041
YEAH.
YEAH.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.208
ANYWAY, SO I WAS TRYING
TO GET MY PICTURES BACK,

06:10.250 --> 06:12.750
AND THEN THE ASSHATS
DRAGGED ME OUT TO THE QUAD

06:12.792 --> 06:16.041
AND DUCT TAPED ME
TO A FLAGPOLE.
OH, THAT'S, UH, NOT GOOD.

06:16.083 --> 06:21.041
YEAH. IT WAS MY DAD THAT
GOT ME INTO ALL THIS STUFF.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.542
IF HE HADN'T DIED,

06:22.583 --> 06:25.458
HE'D PROBABLY
HELP ME KICK THEIR ASSES.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.583
YEAH.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.667
LOOK, CAN'T YOU JUST
WRITE ME A NOTE?

06:30.709 --> 06:32.667
THEN WHAT, HOMESCHOOLING,
WITNESS PROTECTION?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.667
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
TEENAGERS CAN BE JERKS,

06:34.709 --> 06:37.083
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE FOREVER.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.875
SO FIND THE OTHER KIDS
THAT ARE INTO ANIME

06:39.917 --> 06:43.291
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
YEAH, I'M TRYING. BUT WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT NOW?

06:43.333 --> 06:46.208
WELL, WHAT WOULD THE HERO
FROM ONE OF YOUR STORIES DO?

06:46.250 --> 06:48.291
OH, PLEASE DON'T TELL HER.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.291
SHE'S JUST
GONNA MAKE IT WORSE.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.041
DOES HE NEED A CUDDLE
OR A KICK IN THE BACKSIDE?

06:53.083 --> 06:55.500
UM...

06:55.542 --> 06:58.041
WELL, A BUG'S BEEN DOING AROUND,
BUT I THINK HE'S ON THE MEND.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.041
UM, JUST TO BE
ON THE SAFE SIDE,

07:00.083 --> 07:03.041
I'D KEEP HIM HOME
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY,

07:03.083 --> 07:05.041
MAKE SURE
IT'S OUT OF HIS SYSTEM.
OKAY. SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

07:05.083 --> 07:06.917
YEAH.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.834
SHE'S IN UNBEARABLE PAIN,

07:08.875 --> 07:11.875
AND IT'S GOTTEN WORSE
WITH THE PREGNANCY.
BUT DO YOU THINK
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT

07:11.917 --> 07:14.667
SHE SHOULD TERMINATE A PREGNANCY
THAT'S ALMOST VIABLE?
THAT IS A DECISION
FOR ELANA.

07:14.709 --> 07:17.250
BUT THERE ARE TREATMENTS
SHE HASN'T TRIED YET

07:17.291 --> 07:19.041
THAT ALTER THE RELEASE
OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS

07:19.083 --> 07:20.667
AND INCREASE
HER PAIN TOLERANCE.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.667
PETE, I AM NOT EAGER
TO TERMINATE HER PREGNANCY,

07:22.709 --> 07:25.125
BUT I'M ALSO NOT GONNA
LOOK HER IN THE EYE

07:25.166 --> 07:28.625
AND TELL HER
SHE NEEDS TO BE TOUGHER.
IS SHE
HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING?

07:28.667 --> 07:30.208
YEAH, SHE MENTIONED THAT.
SWALLOWING?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.750
YEAH, IT'S IN HER CHART.

07:31.792 --> 07:36.041
ORDER AN M.R.I.

07:36.083 --> 07:38.792
(mouth full) YEP, I'M BRILLIANT.
GET USED TO IT.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.083
AND GET ME THAT BRAIN SCAN.

07:43.625 --> 07:47.000
(footsteps approach)

07:50.166 --> 07:53.458
HEY, I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.041
FEEL LIKE GETTING A SNACK?

07:57.083 --> 07:59.166
THIS IS MY DADDY'S OFFICE.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.583
HE USED TO HAVE CRAYONS

08:01.625 --> 08:03.542
AND PAPER.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.500
YEAH.

08:05.542 --> 08:09.583
I REMEMBER. YOU TWO HAD
A LOT OF FUN IN HERE.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.750
YOU KNOW,
HE LOVED YOU SO MUCH.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.709
AND I KNOW THAT WHEN
SOMEONE YOU LOVE GOES AWAY,

08:14.750 --> 08:16.208
IT FEELS ICKY.

08:16.250 --> 08:19.500
AND IT'S CONFUSING BECAUSE YOU
HAVE ALL THESE BIG FEELINGS

08:19.542 --> 08:21.375
THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.750
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT...

08:26.792 --> 08:30.041
ALL OF US HERE
CARE ABOUT YOU...

08:30.083 --> 08:32.583
SO MUCH...

08:32.625 --> 08:36.583
AND THAT
YOU CAN TELL ANYTHING TO ME.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.041
OKAY?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.000
ANYTHING AT ALL.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.583
(voice breaks) WHERE AM I
GONNA SLEEP TONIGHT?

08:48.083 --> 08:56.000
HOW ABOUT
YOU COME HOME WITH ME?

08:58.083 --> 09:01.500
♪♪♪

09:05.667 --> 09:07.333
SHOULD WE HAVE OFFERED--

09:07.375 --> 09:10.458
MNH-MNH-MNH-MNH-MNH.
DON'T--DON'T EVEN SAY IT.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.250
OH, COME ON, SAM.

09:12.291 --> 09:15.500
ADDISON...

09:15.542 --> 09:19.917
BETSEY NEEDS
MORE THAN WE CAN GIVE HER.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.667
AND IT'S NOT OUR PLACE.

09:21.709 --> 09:24.083
REALLY, IT'S--IT'S NOT
VIOLET'S PLACE EITHER.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.041
YEAH, BUT IT'S ONLY
FOR A FEW NIGHTS.

09:26.083 --> 09:28.041
I MEAN, I TOOK CARE OF LUCAS
FOR MONTHS.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.041
I KNOW,
BUT LUCAS WAS A BABY,

09:30.083 --> 09:32.041
AND--AND ALL DUE RESPECT,

09:32.083 --> 09:35.000
I MEAN, YOU WERE WARM HANDS
TO HOLD HIM.

09:37.542 --> 09:40.000
OH.

09:40.041 --> 09:43.000
WAIT. I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT
TO COME OUT LIKE THAT.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.458
I-I'M JUST TRYING
TO SAY THAT...

09:46.500 --> 09:49.750
FOR YOU,
WHEN YOU HAD TO LET GO,

09:49.792 --> 09:51.834
HOW'D IT FEEL?

09:51.875 --> 09:55.417
SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND
AND GET ATTACHED.

09:55.458 --> 09:57.500
AND IT WOULD BE BRUTAL.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.250
WHY ISN'T LUCAS CRYING YET?

10:06.291 --> 10:08.250
BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS
THAT I WORKED A LONG SHIFT

10:08.291 --> 10:10.041
AT THE E.R. LAST NIGHT,

10:10.083 --> 10:11.959
AND THERE'S ANOTHER KID
IN THE HOUSE.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.208
AND HE'S THOUGHTFUL...
(kisses)

10:13.250 --> 10:15.333
JUST LIKE HIS DADDY.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.375
(singsongy)
GOOD MORNING, BOO-BOO.

10:22.417 --> 10:25.959
RISE AND SHINE.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.041
GOOD MORNING.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.834
(normal voice) PETE!

10:34.375 --> 10:38.333
PETE,
LUCAS IS NOT IN HIS CRIB!

10:43.709 --> 10:46.041
(Lucas babbles)

10:46.083 --> 10:48.041
(cartoon playing indistinctly)

10:48.083 --> 10:51.041
MY DADDY AND I USED TO
WATCH CARTOONS TOGETHER.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.291
I THOUGHT MAYBE LUCAS
WOULD LIKE THEM.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.333
(laughs)

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
(laughs)

11:03.375 --> 11:06.041
Try to relax, Elana.
We're almost done.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.583
The sedative is helping.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.583
TOO BAD WE CAN'T
KEEP HER DOPED UP.

11:09.625 --> 11:13.041
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS HERBAL TEA
AND CHINESE GONGS.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.917
(laughs) OKAY.
THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.291
COME ON, ADDISON.
WE'RE SURGEONS.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.041
YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT YOU
REALLY BUY INTO HIS WHOLE

11:21.083 --> 11:23.041
BAD-JUJU-CAUSED-MY-CANCER RAP,
DO YOU?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.625
PETE HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE.
MM.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.625
AND JUST BECAUSE
YOU DISAGREE WITH HIM

11:27.667 --> 11:29.208
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S WRONG.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.625
WELL, HE'S WRONG THIS TIME.

11:31.667 --> 11:35.041
ELANA DOESN'T HAVE FIBROMYALGIA.
SHE'S GOT A CHIARI MALFORMATION.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.041
THE HERNIATION'S PUTTING
PRESSURE ON HER BRAIN.

11:37.083 --> 11:40.041
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT'S CAUSING HER PAIN?
I DO.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.041
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?

11:42.083 --> 11:44.250
WHAT I DO BEST...

11:44.291 --> 11:46.583
CUT.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.750
(footsteps approach)

11:50.792 --> 11:52.208
HEY.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.208
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST NIGHT
WITH BETSEY?

11:54.250 --> 11:56.583
GOOD. IN FACT,
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

11:56.625 --> 11:59.041
SHE WAS WATCHING CARTOONS
WITH LUCAS.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.000
(laughs)
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.792
IT WAS SWEET, ACTUALLY.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.792
YEAH, SHE, UH,
SHE TOOK LUCAS FROM HIS CRIB

12:05.834 --> 12:07.458
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.500
THAT SOUNDS...

12:09.542 --> 12:11.375
UH, UNNERVING.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.583
NO. I MEAN,
W--IT WAS FOR A MINUTE,

12:13.625 --> 12:15.709
BUT I KNOW
SHE'D NEVER HURT LUCAS.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.250
YEAH, WELL, WE HOPE, YOU KNOW,
BUT BETSEY IS TROUBLED.

12:18.291 --> 12:20.917
SHE NEEDS HELP. SHE NEEDS
SOMEONE TO CARE. THAT'S ALL.

12:20.959 --> 12:23.458
WHAT I MEAN IS,
YOU NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.583
I THINK YOU'RE BLOWING THIS
OUT OF PROPORTION, SHELDON.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.583
SHE'S A CHILD.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.083
BETSEY DOES NEED HELP, OKAY?
YEARS OF HELP.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.458
AND THOSE AREN'T
GOING TO BE EASY YEARS.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.458
NOW COME ON.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

12:34.500 --> 12:37.500
WELL, I THINK WE OWE IT TO HER
AND TO DELL

12:37.542 --> 12:39.458
TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN
FOR HER.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.458
BUT THE BEST THING
YOU CAN DO FOR HER

12:41.500 --> 12:44.709
IS TO HELP HER START A NEW LIFE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
MEANING WITHOUT ME?

12:44.750 --> 12:48.250
I THINK YOU'D HELP BETSEY MOST
BY LETTING HER GO.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.041
(Pete) SO YOU WANT
TO DO BRAIN SURGERY

12:51.083 --> 12:53.041
ON A WOMAN WHO'S ALMOST
SIX MONTHS PREGNANT?

12:53.083 --> 12:55.041
YEAH, IF I RELEASE
THE INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE,

12:55.083 --> 12:57.041
IT SHOULD REDUCE HER PAIN.
IF WE DON'T HELP HER NOW,

12:57.083 --> 12:59.291
SHE'S GONNA TERMINATE
THE PREGNANCY.
I CAN HELP HER.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.417
NOT FAST ENOUGH, PETE.
YOU THINK SURGERY
IS THE BETTER OPTION?

13:01.458 --> 13:03.709
APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT
MIGHT NOT HELP ELANA,

13:03.750 --> 13:05.834
IT COULD ALSO KILL HER.
IT COULD KILL HER BABY.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.834
THIS IS NOT
A COMPLICATED PROCEDURE,

13:07.875 --> 13:09.917
AND THERE IS A HUGE UPSIDE.
FOR CHIARI MALFORMATIONS,

13:09.959 --> 13:12.125
INVERSION THERAPY
HAS THE SAME UPSIDE.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.333
IT CAN RELIEVE THE PRESSURE
ON THE CEREBELLAR TONSILS

13:14.375 --> 13:16.959
AND DIMINISH HER PAIN
FOR WEEKS.
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP
HER UPSIDE DOWN

13:17.000 --> 13:19.166
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE?
I CAN GET HER THROUGH
THE PREGNANCY.

13:19.208 --> 13:22.875
THEN YOU CAN CUT
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, EITHER WAY,
ELANA AND STEVEN

13:22.917 --> 13:24.542
ARE GONNA NEED
SOME GUIDANCE HERE.

13:24.583 --> 13:28.375
FINE. HE MAKES HIS PITCH,
I MAKE MINE.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.583
I'M HORNY.
WANT A QUICKIE?

13:35.625 --> 13:37.583
WELL, EMILY POST
WOULD BE PROUD. (laughs)

13:37.625 --> 13:39.125
(laughs) MM.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.875
MM. HEY, DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD, UM--

13:41.917 --> 13:45.125
LESS TALK. MORE HANDS. MM.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.166
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
DO SOMETHING?

13:47.208 --> 13:49.166
I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.208
(chuckles)
I MEAN ABOUT BETSEY.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.417
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
IF IT WAS OUR KID,

13:53.458 --> 13:54.959
DELL WOULD STEP UP.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.792
WE DON'T HAVE KIDS,
COOPER.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.625
OKAY, IF WE DID...

13:59.667 --> 14:01.166
IT'S JUST, SHE'S HERE,

14:01.208 --> 14:05.208
AND EVERY TIME I LOOK AT HER,
I THINK THAT...

14:06.542 --> 14:08.792
YEAH, YOU HATE ME
RIGHT NOW, DON'T YOU?

14:08.834 --> 14:10.333
A THOUSAND THINGS ABOUT YOU

14:10.375 --> 14:14.291
THAT MAKE ME
WANT TO PULL MY HAIR OUT...

14:14.333 --> 14:17.959
BUT YOU CARING TOO MUCH
IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.250
(sighs)

14:21.291 --> 14:23.667
I'M NOT GETTIN' LAID, AM I?

14:26.500 --> 14:28.583
WHEN YOU'RE FEELIN' RANDY,

14:28.625 --> 14:30.625
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.041
(chuckles)

14:32.083 --> 14:34.542
(clicks lock)

14:34.583 --> 14:37.208
THEY CALLED ME TO COME GET
MY SON BECAUSE HE BROUGHT

14:37.250 --> 14:39.250
A KNIFE TO SCHOOL!
A KNIFE, DR. FREEDMAN!

14:39.291 --> 14:42.417
HE SAYS HE'S BEING BULLIED,
AND THAT'S YOUR SAGE ADVICE?
I NEVER SAID--

14:42.458 --> 14:44.625
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME
WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

14:44.667 --> 14:46.792
HE'S ONLY 14.
MOM, PLEASE.

14:46.834 --> 14:49.250
NO--
JACKIE, JACKIE, LET'S SIT DOWN
AND WE CAN TALK--

14:49.291 --> 14:51.291
AND--AND DO WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL HIM NEXT?

14:51.333 --> 14:54.458
I'M TRYING TO HELP.
REALLY? YOU COULD'VE
GOTTEN HIM KILLED.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.542
LET'S GO.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.000
(elevator bell dings)

15:10.625 --> 15:12.291
MA'AM, HI.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.291
MY NAME IS DR. WALLACE.
I'M A PSYCHIATRIST.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.250
CAN WE TALK FOR A MINUTE?
NO.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.041
(clicks button)

15:22.542 --> 15:24.250
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.834
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU
IF I CAN.

15:26.875 --> 15:29.041
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH KENNY.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THERE IS,

15:29.083 --> 15:30.917
BUT YOU DID ARM YOURSELF.

15:30.959 --> 15:33.291
AND I THINK I CAN HELP YOU WORK
THROUGH SOME OF YOUR ISSUES.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.458
MY SON CAN TALK TO ME.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.333
I'M SURE HE CAN,
BUT DOES HE?
(ding)

15:38.375 --> 15:39.750
(doors open)

15:39.792 --> 15:41.750
ELANA'S BRAIN
IS TOO LARGE FOR HER SKULL,

15:41.792 --> 15:43.709
AND LIKE ANY BODY PART
THAT GETS SHOVED

15:43.750 --> 15:45.709
INTO AN AREA THAT'S TOO SMALL,
IT CAN CAUSE PAIN.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.709
BUT IF I SHAVE OFF
A SMALL PART OF THE BONE

15:47.750 --> 15:49.709
AT THE BACK OF THE SKULL,

15:49.750 --> 15:51.709
REMOVE A PATCH
OF THE BRAIN COVERING,

15:51.750 --> 15:54.041
AND SEW IN A NEW, BIGGER ONE--
HER PAIN GOES AWAY?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.458
MAYBE.
LIKELY.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.166
BUT THERE ARE RISKS.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.583
WHAT ARE THEY?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.667
ELANA COULD DIE,
OR YOUR SON COULD.

16:01.709 --> 16:04.041
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION.
I CAN POSITION YOUR BODY

16:04.083 --> 16:06.166
TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE
THAT'S CAUSING THE PAIN.

16:06.208 --> 16:08.500
I WOULD WORK WITH YOU EVERY DAY
FOR THE REST OF YOUR PREGNANCY

16:08.542 --> 16:10.917
TO HELP YOU MANAGE IT.
DR. MONTGOMERY?

16:10.959 --> 16:12.667
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:12.709 --> 16:15.291
I THINK THAT BOTH OPTIONS
ARE VIABLE.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.709
OH, PLEASE.
DON'T BE DIPLOMATIC.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.250
JUST TELL ME
WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:22.375 --> 16:25.291
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE
THE SURGERY.

16:25.333 --> 16:29.041
I'LL BE THERE TO MONITOR
THE BABY THE ENTIRE TIME.

16:29.083 --> 16:32.166
(inhales deeply)
HOW SOON CAN WE DO IT?

16:32.208 --> 16:35.500
ELANA, NO. I DON'T WANT
A LIFE WITHOUT YOU.

16:35.542 --> 16:39.834
WITH ALL THIS PAIN, WHAT KIND
OF LIFE HAVE YOU HAD WITH ME?

16:39.875 --> 16:42.041
(inhales) OH.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.834
I WANT THE SURGERY.

16:51.542 --> 16:55.041
THAT'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE
OF T-SHIRT.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.041
IT'S ANIME.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.583
"TAKAO'S TURN."
GENIUS KID FINDS A PEN,

16:59.625 --> 17:01.792
AND ANYONE WHOSE NAME
HE WRITES WITH IT DIES.

17:01.834 --> 17:05.041
YOU'RE A FAN BOY?
I'M AN ACTION GUY.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.208
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

17:06.250 --> 17:08.000
WELL, FANTASY, MOSTLY.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.208
I LIKE THE ONES

17:09.250 --> 17:11.458
WHERE THE BAD GUYS GET
WHAT'S COMING TO THEM.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.667
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

17:14.709 --> 17:17.166
NOT IN THEORY.
I WAS PROTECTING MYSELF.

17:17.208 --> 17:20.542
A WEAPON SEEMS EXCESSIVE
IN RESPONSE TO HUMILIATION.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.792
WELL, THEY DID MORE.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.000
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT IT?

17:35.166 --> 17:37.375
THEY KICKED ME,

17:37.417 --> 17:39.041
AND THEY WOULDN'T STOP

17:39.083 --> 17:41.041
TILL I TOOK OFF
MY ANIME SHIRT.

17:41.083 --> 17:45.500
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
THEIR ACCEPTANCE, DR. WALLACE.

17:47.125 --> 17:48.917
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:48.959 --> 17:52.834
I GUESS I JUST WANT
WHAT DR. FREEDMAN SAID,

17:52.875 --> 17:54.792
TO STAY
IN ONE SCHOOL LONG ENOUGH

17:54.834 --> 17:57.375
THAT I CAN FIND KIDS...

17:57.417 --> 17:59.375
LIKE ME.

17:59.417 --> 18:02.667
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU CHANGED SCHOOLS?

18:02.709 --> 18:05.166
SIX TIMES IN TWO YEARS.

18:05.208 --> 18:08.291
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT
MY MOM TO FIND OUT,

18:08.333 --> 18:10.625
'CAUSE SHE
JUST KEEPS FREAKING OUT.

18:10.667 --> 18:15.333
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE THE NEW KID IN SCHOOL

18:15.375 --> 18:18.166
OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

18:20.250 --> 18:22.041
(Sam)
POSTERIOR FOSSA DECOMPRESSION,

18:22.083 --> 18:24.041
THAT'S RISKY
ON A PREGNANT WOMAN.

18:24.083 --> 18:27.041
YEAH, SHE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN,
AND IF WE CAN'T HELP HER,

18:27.083 --> 18:29.041
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO ABORT.
DAD'S DESPERATE.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.041
IT'S JUST--
IT'S A BAD SITUATION.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.041
Y-YOU SEE HOW HARD
ALL THESE PEOPLE WORK

18:33.083 --> 18:34.291
TO BECOME PARENTS,

18:34.333 --> 18:37.291
AND THE LENGTHS THAT NAOMI GOES
THROUGH TO GET THEM PREGNANT,

18:37.333 --> 18:41.041
AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO,
AND YOU WONDER--I WONDER--

18:41.083 --> 18:43.458
YOU KNOW,
IS IT EVEN WORTH IT?

18:43.500 --> 18:45.875
HOW CAN YOU THINK THAT?
YOU HAVE MAYA.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.041
YEAH, MAYA WHO IS 16,

18:48.083 --> 18:49.667
HAS HER OWN BABY,

18:49.709 --> 18:52.458
AND IS MARRIED
TO A GUY NAMED DINK.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.041
(laughs)

18:54.083 --> 18:57.041
I MEAN, NAOMI AND I,
WE DID EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD,

18:57.083 --> 18:59.125
A-AND MAYA HAD
SO MANY ADVANTAGES,

18:59.166 --> 19:00.792
BUT STILL...

19:00.834 --> 19:04.875
I DON'T KNOW. I-I LOOK AT MAYA,
AND I LOOK AT BETSEY,

19:04.917 --> 19:09.125
AND... I THINK SOMETIMES,
IT'S JUST FUTILE.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.750
OKAY. I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT
THIS SPEECH

19:11.792 --> 19:14.709
TO THE MOTHER WHO'S ABOUT
TO HAVE BRAIN SURGERY

19:14.750 --> 19:16.667
TO SAVE HER BABY.

19:16.709 --> 19:19.208
I'M SORRY. I...

19:19.250 --> 19:23.041
LOOK, I FEEL REALLY...
REALLY BAD ABOUT BETSEY.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.709
I DO. BUT I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE

19:25.750 --> 19:28.375
THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE
ABOUT HER.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.834
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:29.875 --> 19:33.291
I MEAN THAT IF VIOLET
DIDN'T TAKE HER,

19:33.333 --> 19:35.959
THAT I STILL WOULD'VE SAID NO.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.083
I ALREADY HAVE A CHILD,
ADDISON,

19:39.125 --> 19:41.458
AND A GRANDCHILD.

19:43.959 --> 19:46.083
I DON'T.

19:46.125 --> 19:47.500
WELL, CAN YOU EVEN--

19:47.542 --> 19:49.291
I DON'T KNOW, SAM.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.458
BUT YOU WANT TO?
I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.250
WELL, THEN WHY ARE YOU
PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT?

19:54.291 --> 19:56.375
BECAUSE... I WANT TO BELIEVE

19:56.417 --> 19:59.375
THAT IF I DID WANT
TO HAVE A CHILD WITH YOU,

19:59.417 --> 20:01.417
THAT YOU WOULD.

20:30.458 --> 20:33.041
(refrigerator opens,
bottles clatter)

20:33.083 --> 20:34.500
GIVE HER A MINUTE.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.208
(fizzing)

20:42.250 --> 20:44.166
(laughing)

20:44.208 --> 20:45.709
(laughing)

20:45.750 --> 20:48.417
YOU--YOU WANT TO TRY?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.250
(both laugh)

20:53.291 --> 20:55.291
(fizzing)
AAH! OH! (laughing)

20:55.333 --> 20:58.542
(laughing)

20:58.583 --> 21:00.792

COULDN'T REALLY FIND
YOUR PLACE?

21:36.083 --> 21:38.041

I BEDDED THE PROM QUEEN

21:38.083 --> 21:39.792
THREE YEARS RUNNING,

21:39.834 --> 21:42.667
AND THE LAST ONE'S SISTER, TOO.

21:42.709 --> 21:44.583

COOL IN ITS WAY.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000

TOOK A LOT OF DEAD ARMS,

22:00.041 --> 22:02.041

22:04.083 --> 22:05.333

22:05.375 --> 22:09.041

FOR A DATE WITH NORMA JACKS,

22:09.083 --> 22:12.125
AND NO ONE EVER
SCREWED WITH ME AGAIN.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.583
KENNY'S DAD BOUGHT HIM
HIS FIRST DECK OF POKéMON CARDS

22:15.625 --> 22:17.041
WHEN HE WAS 7.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.959
NOW ANIME
IS A WORLD HE CAN GO TO

22:20.000 --> 22:21.959

22:22.000 --> 22:24.417
AND THE DIMWITTED BULLIES
DON'T GET TO WIN.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.041
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A BETTER PLACE FOR HIM TO BE.

22:27.083 --> 22:30.917
THEY'RE HURTING HIM, COOPER,
AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.917
AND KENNY SAYS
JACKIE'S RESPONSE IS ALWAYS

22:32.959 --> 22:35.625
TO PULL HIM OUT OF SCHOOL.
WELL, SHE WANTS TO KEEP HIM
OUT OF THE LINE OF FIRE.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.417
YEAH, BUT FIGURING OUT
HOW TO ADAPT,

22:37.458 --> 22:40.041
LEARNING HOW RESILIENT
YOU CAN BE, I MEAN, THOSE SKILLS

22:40.083 --> 22:42.041
ARE ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOPING
INTO A COMPETENT ADULT.

22:42.083 --> 22:44.041
I TOLD KENNY
TO STAND UP FOR HIMSELF

22:44.083 --> 22:46.625
UNTIL HE COULD FIND HIS PEOPLE,
THERE'D BE SAFETY IN NUMBERS.

22:46.667 --> 22:49.041
BUT IF JACKIE'S NEVER GONNA
GIVE HIM THAT CHANCE...
WELL, THEN
HE'LL NEVER LEARN TO COPE.

22:49.083 --> 22:51.041
THAT'S A POINT I'D LIKE
TO MAKE TO JACKIE,

22:51.083 --> 22:53.959

SOMEONE'S GONNA KICK YOUR ASS.

WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY AND GO.

PULLING HIM OUT OF SCHOOL.

WOULDN'T YOU?

23:04.041 --> 23:05.959

TO SHIELD HIM, BUT--

23:06.000 --> 23:08.041

23:08.083 --> 23:09.458
NO, THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.667

23:11.709 --> 23:13.041
JACKIE, THE WORST IN PEOPLE,

23:13.083 --> 23:15.709
IT STARTS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE.

23:15.750 --> 23:18.083
AND PART OF GROWING UP IS
LEARNING HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT.

23:18.125 --> 23:21.166
NOW IF--IF YOU DON'T
GIVE HIM TIME TO ADAPT--

23:21.208 --> 23:24.041
I WILL NOT SEND HIM BACK
TO BE ATTACKED.

23:24.083 --> 23:26.458
IT TAKES EVERYTHING I'VE GOT NOT
TO GO IN THERE AND KILL THEM.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.041
TEMPTING AS THAT MAY BE,
IF YOU LET ME,

23:29.083 --> 23:32.667
I CAN HELP KENNY DEVELOP
THE SKILLS TO HANDLE THIS.

23:32.709 --> 23:34.834
SKILLS?

23:34.875 --> 23:36.041
HE'S 14 YEARS OLD,

23:36.083 --> 23:39.041
AND HE COMES HOME AND CRIES
EVERY DAY, LIKE A BABY.

23:39.083 --> 23:42.417
IT KILLS ME, BUT...

23:42.458 --> 23:45.542
IT ALSO DRIVES ME CRAZY.

23:45.583 --> 23:49.041
AFTER MY HUSBAND DIED,
I-I LET IT GO FOR A WHILE.

23:49.083 --> 23:52.041

23:52.083 --> 23:54.625

FOR HIM.

24:34.917 --> 24:37.542

AT LEAST AT THE BEGINNING,

24:37.583 --> 24:40.542

IMPROVEMENTS IN A FEW MONTHS.

24:40.583 --> 24:43.083

24:43.125 --> 24:46.041
