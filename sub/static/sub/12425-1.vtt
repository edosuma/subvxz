WEBVTT

00:31.831 --> 00:35.108
Thank you all listeners
for following us tonight.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.113
The first symphony,

00:37.504 --> 00:41.816
"Fruit of a burning time,"
that Schumann wrote,

00:42.275 --> 00:45.813
was composed
in the winter of 1841

00:45.879 --> 00:47.381
in just four days,

00:47.480 --> 00:50.188
between January 23rd and 26th.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.865
Orchestrated by the composer
in less than a month,

00:53.953 --> 00:56.126
it was finished on February 20th

00:56.189 --> 00:58.191
and performed
for the first time,

00:58.291 --> 01:00.293
on March 31st of that same year

01:00.360 --> 01:03.000
under the direction
of Felix Mendelssohn.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.533
The orchestration
is composed of,

01:05.632 --> 01:06.804
two flutes,

01:07.000 --> 01:08.001
two oboes,

01:08.134 --> 01:09.306
two clarinets,

01:09.369 --> 01:10.677
two bassoons,

01:10.737 --> 01:11.875
four horns,

01:11.971 --> 01:13.006
two trumpets,

01:13.073 --> 01:14.074
three trombones,

01:14.307 --> 01:15.809
timpani, triangle

01:16.076 --> 01:17.316
and harp.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.680
We listen now to the first movement,

01:20.747 --> 01:24.490
andante un poco maestoso,
allegro molto vivace.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.530
Duration,
10 minutes, 28 seconds.

01:28.388 --> 01:31.369
Specially dedicated to Lorena.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.177
Lorena!

01:45.238 --> 01:46.581
I'm coming!

02:55.008 --> 02:57.284
LIST OF CHARACTERS

02:57.343 --> 03:00.688

03:00.780 --> 03:04.318
PAULA, the girlfriend

03:04.417 --> 03:07.990
NATALIA, the ex-girlfriend

03:08.087 --> 03:11.660

03:11.758 --> 03:15.365

03:26.439 --> 03:30.046
ANNOUNCER

03:30.143 --> 03:34.182
MUSICIANS

06:09.268 --> 06:16.152
THE PRINCESS OF FRANCE

06:27.553 --> 06:29.362
It's started already.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.507
We're in the fourth act.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.064
Sit down there.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.370
Rehearsal's almost over.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.536
- Do you know the plot?
- No.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.841
The four made a pact not to get
carried away by their lovers,

06:43.903 --> 06:45.382
to not love them anymore,

06:45.471 --> 06:47.246
but now they'll start
to betray each other, one by one,

06:47.340 --> 06:49.377
without saying a word.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.647
- Let's go.
- Okay.

06:54.313 --> 06:56.725
The blackness of his hair
shames black itself.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.990
And the monstrosity of his face

07:00.052 --> 07:02.896
shames monsters themselves.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.596
And beautiful like the day.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.569
- If only...
- If only...

07:08.661 --> 07:09.799
If only...

07:09.862 --> 07:12.638
If only...

07:12.698 --> 07:17.044
I would have liked to have forgotten him.
But he is like a fever.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.582
And the desire...

07:18.671 --> 07:20.082
I want to hear him again.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.380
Again?

07:22.775 --> 07:26.188
I wish the other three
were in love as well.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.020
Misery loves company.

07:28.181 --> 07:33.597
Poor solace is just an excuse.

07:34.454 --> 07:39.267
His love is not charitable
if he sees we share in his anguish.

07:39.358 --> 07:44.034
What an embarrassment!

07:44.096 --> 07:47.270
Come, Olivia, you blush,
as his your case is such.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.972
You chide at him, offending twice as much.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.379
Don't you love a younger fellow?

07:52.438 --> 07:54.577
I have been closely shrouded in this bush,

07:54.640 --> 07:56.813
and mark'd you both
and for you both did blush.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.082
I heard your guilty rhymes,
observed your fashion,

07:59.145 --> 08:02.456
saw sighs reek from you,
noted well your passion.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.084
"Ay me!" says one.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.096
"O Jove!" the other cries.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.793
What will Antonio say when
that he shall hear faith so infringed?

08:09.889 --> 08:13.393
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.

08:13.459 --> 08:17.965
What grace hast thou,
thus to reprove these worms for loving,

08:18.064 --> 08:20.442
that art most in love?

08:20.633 --> 08:23.409
But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.449
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,

08:25.505 --> 08:28.952
of sighs, of groans,
of sorrow and of teen!

08:29.141 --> 08:32.179
Tell me, Gentle Bassanio.
Where lies thy grief?

08:32.278 --> 08:34.315
Where lies thy pain, Good Olivia?

08:34.413 --> 08:37.087
And yours, Silvius?

08:37.183 --> 08:41.359
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?

08:41.821 --> 08:44.802
We are the cheaters
while other are spying.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.497
Not you to me, but I betray'd by you,

08:47.593 --> 08:51.541
I am betray'd, by keeping company with men
like men of inconstancy.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.334
When shall you see me
write a thing in rhyme?

08:54.433 --> 08:57.471
Or groan for love?
Or spend a minute's time in pruning me?

08:57.637 --> 09:00.811
When shall you hear
that I will praise a hand,

09:00.940 --> 09:03.511
a foot, a face, an eye.

09:03.776 --> 09:05.119
Let's go outside.

09:06.779 --> 09:08.816
Soft! Whither away so fast?

09:08.881 --> 09:12.886
A true man or a thief that gallops so?

09:13.185 --> 09:14.858
I post from love.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.237
- Are you okay?
- Yes, fine.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.675
- Need anything?
- No, no.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.579
The guy next to me wasn't feeling well
and I got worried.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.082
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.378
He had to go out.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.510
- He's in the bathroom?
- No, still inside.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.714
Want to go back in?

09:37.810 --> 09:39.187
I'll wait for him here.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.724
Guillermo. And you?

09:40.813 --> 09:41.985
Lorena.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.652
Follow me.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.195
But he may come.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.891
Stay here.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.489
- Okay.
- Thank you.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.734
Come on. Come on!

09:52.825 --> 09:54.327
Not that. The quills.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.701
The knife.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.744
Here's the list. Follow the numbers.

10:00.833 --> 10:01.834
I can't read it.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.539
Next, the bows. For Victor.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.673
Thanks.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.549
<i>Natalia saw everything from backstage.</i>

10:13.613 --> 10:15.354
<i>”Don't tell anyone,” I mean to tell her.</i>

10:15.414 --> 10:17.087
<i>But you know Natalia.</i>

10:17.183 --> 10:18.787
<i>She doesn't even look at me.</i>

10:23.222 --> 10:25.634
<i>And soon after, the same thing with you.</i>

10:25.725 --> 10:26.863
<i>Paula.</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:28.196
<i>Paula.</i>

10:28.294 --> 10:31.207
<i>And nothing. Not a move, not a word.</i>

10:33.566 --> 10:36.410
And then, he comes through the door
in his shorts.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.743
He asks for a ring.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.248
To give him a ring.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.945
I check the list, but it's too dark.
I can't see anything.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.715
Try checking on the table
but I still see nothing.

10:44.777 --> 10:45.778
Victor!

10:45.878 --> 10:49.553
I try to see my hands,
nothing, completely blind.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.617
Sol notice he's nervous.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.458
To calm him down,
I decide to give him my own ring.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.556
And there, you wake up.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.743
Every time I am about
to give him the ring, I wake up.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.466
- Always the same?
- Yes. And with your boyfriend.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.732
I wanted to tell you,
it makes me feel bad.

11:04.797 --> 11:07.277
It's nothing. Just a bit obsessed.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.805
Maybe.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.745
Aren't you sad he's leaving?

11:13.806 --> 11:15.513
Yeah, but there's not much I can do.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.087
How can you be so at ease?

11:17.143 --> 11:19.248
If I were you, I'd go with him.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.726
Did you tell Jimena?

11:27.620 --> 11:29.497
That her boyfriend kept on kissing me?

11:29.588 --> 11:30.623
What are you two up to?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.431
I was thinking of Victor.

11:32.925 --> 11:37.772
Maybe, if Paula stays here, I'll tell him
I could go to Mexico with him.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.275
- You, to Mexico?
- Yes.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.641
Now that his father passed away,
don't you think he had enough?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.341
- He may want to be alone.
- And do as Paula does?

11:46.105 --> 11:49.279
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.278
<i>That night, as in previous ones,</i>

11:52.344 --> 11:54.221
<i>Lorena didn't say a word to anyone.</i>

11:54.313 --> 11:56.156
<i>Not to me, nor to Victor.</i>

11:56.449 --> 11:59.362
<i>And as it was already planned,
a week later,</i>

11:59.452 --> 12:01.557
<i>Victor traveled to Mexico for a year.</i>

12:02.188 --> 12:04.464
<i>I remained in Buenos Aires,
waiting for him.</i>

12:04.790 --> 12:06.133
<i>During that year,</i>

12:06.192 --> 12:09.867
<i>Lorena went through more
heartbreaks than breakthroughs.</i>

12:15.801 --> 12:17.542
<i>The year went by.</i>

12:17.803 --> 12:22.252
<i>I kept my promise to continue
only with Victor in spite of the distance.</i>

12:22.475 --> 12:24.250
<i>But a month before his arrival,</i>

12:24.343 --> 12:26.880
<i>someone appeared that
complicated everything.</i>

12:27.079 --> 12:30.856
<i>Victor returned
and called everyone to get together again.</i>

12:31.016 --> 12:32.654
<i>He wanted us back in the play</i>

12:32.718 --> 12:35.562
<i>that had brought us
together in the first place.</i>

12:35.654 --> 12:36.894
<i>With Victor in town,</i>

12:36.989 --> 12:40.732
<i>I decided to hide myself for some days
of quiet thinking.</i>

12:47.666 --> 12:49.009
Where are you?

12:49.068 --> 12:50.706
No, I can't talk now.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.379
No, no. Don't come now.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.744
Yes, I want to see you too
but I'm with Jimena.

12:57.376 --> 13:00.357
She'll tell everybody.
Do you want Paula to know?

13:02.081 --> 13:04.220
Come, but I won't pay
much attention to you.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.927
I don't know. Make something up.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.725
I don't know, something like that.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.564
But don't be all happy,
or she'll find out.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.721
I thought you'd arrive next week.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.128
I came early.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.461
- Have you seen Natalia lately?
- No.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.229
I moved up my ticket for her.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.828
To surprise her
but she didn't want to meet me.

13:47.927 --> 13:51.602
You don't know this, but we've been
writing to each other since I left.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.975
Lately, I've been talking
more with her than with Paula.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.308
Natalia told me that Paula
is seeing someone else.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.748
As she told me this,
I drifted more and more towards her.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.251
And what about Paula?

14:02.308 --> 14:04.652
I don't know. Just before my arrival,

14:04.743 --> 14:07.451
she told me she had to go
on a trip somewhere.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.584
- Suspicious.
- Tell me about it.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.321
Any idea who she could be seeing?

14:11.383 --> 14:12.384
No.

14:12.451 --> 14:13.691
Natalia was to help me with that.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.130
Nothing seems to be working out for you.

14:16.188 --> 14:21.035
Maybe not. But I thought it would be best
not to wait any longer,

14:21.093 --> 14:26.042
move up my trip, surprise Natalia,
and resolve everything with Paula.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.977
Sounds good, not to give up
the possibility of change.

14:29.034 --> 14:33.346
Being here will clear up
everything somehow.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.043
I'll continue my life
abroad with one of them.

14:35.107 --> 14:36.108
Or with none?

14:36.175 --> 14:37.745
And all this happened today?

14:37.810 --> 14:39.756
I've been wandering around for hours.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.684
You look pretty.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.886
You'll call her later on to meet her.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.361
What a pity.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.526
I need to distract myself.
How are you doing, girls?

14:49.588 --> 14:50.828
"How are we doing?"

14:50.890 --> 14:52.892
Yeah, I don't know. Tell me something.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.131
We have to catch up. What are you up to?

14:55.194 --> 14:56.229
I'm doing fine.

14:56.328 --> 14:59.673
I came to see Ana
and I'm making a small catalogue.

15:01.033 --> 15:02.137
And what else?

15:02.201 --> 15:03.544
What else, what?

15:03.636 --> 15:06.048
Your life or Ana's.

15:06.138 --> 15:07.549
Just tell me something.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.517
I'm doing two plays. One with Ana.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.555
I'm still with Guillermo, always so-so.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.646
I'm thinking about moving out soon,
not with him.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.817
I swim for my back, and I'm doing better.

15:16.548 --> 15:19.051
I'm talking to mother again,
and my father's still dead.

15:19.151 --> 15:20.721
Same here. Mine's dead, too.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.060
Yes, I remember.
Are you feeling any better?

15:23.155 --> 15:24.498
So-so.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.433
Sometimes I get really upset.
It was too much.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.505
But now it's getting better.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.837
I sold his house, paid his debts,
I'm in charge of his theater.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.505
I still have two or three things
to do there. It's okay.

15:35.567 --> 15:36.875
And what about you?

15:37.536 --> 15:39.174
It's been a year since we last talked.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.239
Yeah, sort of.

15:41.173 --> 15:43.676
I don't know. Many things happened.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.715
- I see, you're pregnant.
- Yes.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.519
- Whose is it? Ricardo's?
- No.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.452
- Pablo?
- No.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.796
- Guillermo?
- No.

15:53.886 --> 15:54.921
You don't know him.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.626
- But what's his name?
- I don't remember.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.596
And what will the child's name be?

16:00.659 --> 16:02.229
Victor, in your honor.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.274
False. I don't know yet.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.635
Who's Natalia dating?

16:05.698 --> 16:06.904
Stop thinking about her.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.468
So tell me something about you.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.070
Go home and we'll talk there.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.747
Look what she gave me.

16:12.271 --> 16:15.684
Every time I see something of his,
I think of Ana and I get it for her.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.220
She's building me a Bouguereauteque.

16:17.276 --> 16:20.348
There's no motivation for the gifts,
but this time, it could not be.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.824
I'm helping her with
the replacement job here.

16:22.881 --> 16:25.828
- Well, not everything is possible.
- Exactly, not everything is possible.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.524
- Back to college?
- I'm writing my thesis now.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.260
- And how is it going?
- Not sure yet.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.357
Do you like what you do?

16:31.423 --> 16:33.403
It's good to finish what I started.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.665
- Speak to him.
- Thank you.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.967
Jimena got it.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.201
You came back the same jerk as before.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.436
- Does it have a title?
- No, not yet.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.069
It's still on Bouguereau.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.511
Thankfully.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.441
In fact, she was showing me
one of his paintings.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.179
- Here?
- We were looking at it when you called.

16:49.274 --> 16:50.810
Are there postcards of those here?

16:50.909 --> 16:51.944
No.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.922
- Maybe, in the store.
<i>- I'll</i> take a look.

16:53.979 --> 16:54.980
Okay.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.026
The originals are here.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.654
So it would be my unmotivated gift.
Be back in a minute.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.106
You think you're funny, huh?

17:11.163 --> 17:12.436
- Did you like my Natalia trick?
- Not much.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.842
You've just changed my name for hers.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.344
She won't notice.

17:16.435 --> 17:19.382
We sent her to
the closed store of a closed museum.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.848
She'd better realize what
her boyfriend is doing with my girlfriend.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.886
Leave Guillermo out of this.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.548
Are you getting back together with Paula?

17:26.612 --> 17:29.058
- Come here. Kiss me.
- No. Stop it.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.216
Come here.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.726
Soft, not so rough.
She'll be back at anytime now.

17:35.821 --> 17:36.856
Let's leave, then.

17:36.955 --> 17:39.697
We sent her away already
and now you want to ditch her?

17:39.792 --> 17:40.862
She'll tell everyone.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.462
If you keep on talking,
you'll tell everybody.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.736
Natalia invited me to a closed museum
and kissed me there,

17:45.831 --> 17:48.402
after weeks of secretly
planning everything by email.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.037
What's your problem all of a sudden?

17:51.136 --> 17:52.706
Did you find the maintenance guy?

17:52.805 --> 17:54.011
It's closed. Have the key?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.711
Not to the store.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.087
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.554
Kept talking to him.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.716
- And the people from restoration?
- Not a soul.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.054
Keep talking to him about Bouguereau.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.651
Tell me about this guy,
so I'll forget Natalia.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.520
Frenchman, 19th century.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.759
Forgotten today, but key figure back then.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.095
Painted in the 20th century, too.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.727
Enemy of the Impressionists.
Master of many.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.705
Female portraits,
large scale and solidity.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.402
Models in his studio,
with such perfect results that

18:19.498 --> 18:24.345
they exceeded all realism of the time,
becoming something stranger. Enough?

18:24.436 --> 18:26.177
No, why? Please, continue.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.182
- But look into my eyes.
- Why?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.686
Yes, so I'll focus better.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.455
Besides being a perfectionist,
he was a huge business man.

18:33.512 --> 18:36.049
He did large scale paintings
with epic and expensive motifs

18:36.115 --> 18:38.925
so as to purposely put them out of market,

18:39.017 --> 18:43.261
donating them to churches and such,
gaining so much prestige

18:43.355 --> 18:45.096
that he could push up
the prices of his other works

18:45.190 --> 18:48.569
especially the many smaller ones,
with simpler techniques.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.608
Those paintings that created
in every bourgeois

18:51.697 --> 18:54.871
the need to obtain some of this prestige,

18:54.933 --> 18:57.880
even if it'd be from a painting of
a baby girl or a barefoot countrywoman.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.616
A whole strategy that was very successful.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.981
Here it says that some of his paintings
ended up decorating brothels

19:02.040 --> 19:03.110
in the United States.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.119
Yes, the Americans loved him very much.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.451
What amazes me is that while others
were decomposing the universe

19:07.546 --> 19:08.581
in a variety of stains,

19:08.647 --> 19:10.847
this guy insisted on painting
secularized little virgins

19:10.883 --> 19:12.556
with raped-like expressions.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.224
Okay, it's not working.
You are thinking about something else.

19:15.287 --> 19:16.595
No. Why? Carry on.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.134
<i>Here, The Birth of Venus.</i>

19:18.223 --> 19:20.794
Many must have
touched themselves while looking at this.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.566
It was fashionable at the time.

19:22.628 --> 19:24.471
He did paintings that
were accepted in the salons

19:24.563 --> 19:26.839
while Monet, Renoir
and the others were rejected.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.071
- You like him?
- Not necessarily.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.171
Degas said he was
a smug jerk or something.

19:31.270 --> 19:36.242
They began calling "bouguereaute"
a certain eunuch horny decadence.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.868
Today you were left a bit bouguereauté.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.412
Pretty much bouguereauté.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.253
- Do you like it?
- I don't know.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.451
It reminds you of Natalia?

19:42.514 --> 19:43.857
- You think so?
- True.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.149
- You shouldn't have said that.
- But it looks like her.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.596
Let's see another one.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.655
<i>Surprised Nymph by Manet.</i>

19:49.755 --> 19:50.825
This is the same as the last one.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.368
Does it remind you of Natalia, too?

19:52.457 --> 19:54.994
This one is uglier,
but it has Natalia's gestures.

19:55.093 --> 19:58.040
- Neither reminds you of Paula?
- No.

19:59.097 --> 20:02.010
You don't like it much
because her legs are crossed.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.171
The other gave herself to you
and this one rejects you.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.612
I couldn't meet Natalia today.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.514
She slipped me a note under the door.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.142
She'll explain to you later.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.188
She'll turn out to be
your perfect Bouguereau.

20:11.276 --> 20:12.778
Maybe she just likes writing to you.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.653
So much so as to make me come over here?

20:14.713 --> 20:16.818
You came by yourself, manipulated by her.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.361
Okay, I learned the lesson.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.850
Go over there. I'll take a picture.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.296
- You think so?
- Yeah.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.354
Seriously?

20:22.454 --> 20:24.798
Come on. Next to the painting.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.199
Will you call her to join the play?

20:28.293 --> 20:29.863
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.066
Has everybody answered you back?

20:31.163 --> 20:33.006
- Almost everybody.
- Who didn't?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.373
Natalia, actually.

20:35.867 --> 20:36.937
Done.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.847
Are you sure you want us
all together again?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.019
It's a matter of recording
a pilot of the play.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.850
If it is accepted, we'll sign a contract

20:44.910 --> 20:48.050
to do six or seven
Shakespeare plays for the radio.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.921
- Is there money in that?
- Yes.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.723
- It's Guillermo. He's outside. Join me?
- Yes.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.229
And I'll go home.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.730
Talking about work suits you.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.858
Focus on the play
and forget about the rest.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.994
Just like you forgot about me,
Paula and many more.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.059
Sure.

21:01.159 --> 21:03.435
All the focus on the play
and sacrifice all the women?

21:03.528 --> 21:06.065
It wouldn't resemble you
but it's worth a try.

21:06.164 --> 21:07.575
I've changed a lot since we last met.

21:07.666 --> 21:08.838
You won't chase us anymore?

21:08.900 --> 21:11.312
I have no time for that.
I am very busy now.

21:11.370 --> 21:12.405
Do you remember your lines?

21:12.471 --> 21:14.542
"Advance your standards,
and upon them, lords."

21:14.606 --> 21:17.212
"Pell-mell, down with them!
But be first advised."

21:17.276 --> 21:19.256
"Shall we resolve to woo
these girls of France?"

21:19.344 --> 21:20.345
"And win them too!"

21:20.746 --> 21:22.089
Guillermo.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.860
- What's up?
- How are you doing?

21:24.916 --> 21:27.192
- Fine.
- When did you arrive?

21:27.252 --> 21:28.856
- This morning.
- Good.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.594
- We'll start soon, won't we?
- Tomorrow or the day after.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.294
<i>- I'll</i> email you.
- Great.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.286
- Where are you going?
- This way, aren't we?

21:36.361 --> 21:38.034
- No, that way?
- Okay.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.208
I'll write to you.

21:40.265 --> 21:43.109
- How are you?
- It's great you came.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.977
- I thought you knew.
- I didn't expect you.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.043
- I sent you a message.
- I just saw it.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.507
Victor.

23:24.569 --> 23:28.039
Seeing you so suddenly
and hearing you talking about Paula

23:28.140 --> 23:31.349
made me understand
how little is left of me in you

23:31.410 --> 23:33.412
without her in the middle.

23:33.512 --> 23:36.891
I think it's better to do
as you said a while ago,

23:36.982 --> 23:39.929
focus on the play
and allow yourself to forget

23:40.018 --> 23:42.225
this less than perfect moment.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.324
Leave the keys on the table.
Do not come back.

23:45.390 --> 23:49.099
And see you at the recording.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.765
Ana

24:12.217 --> 24:14.026
Prologue, take 3.

24:29.267 --> 24:32.407
<i>Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of Navarre?</i>

24:32.871 --> 24:36.284
<i>Since a crooked figure may
attest in little place a million</i>

24:36.374 --> 24:38.615
<i>And let us, ciphers to this great accompt</i>

24:38.710 --> 24:41.054
<i>On your imaginary forces work</i>

24:42.047 --> 24:43.890
<i>Suppose within the girdle of these voices</i>

24:43.949 --> 24:45.951
<i>Are now confined seven mighty lovers</i>

24:46.051 --> 24:48.930
<i>Piece out our imperfections
with your thoughts</i>

24:49.087 --> 24:50.293
<i>Convert me into a princess</i>

24:50.388 --> 24:53.130
<i>And make the six remaining ladies
into six proud men</i>

24:53.225 --> 24:57.173
<i>For 'tis your thoughts that
now must deck our kings</i>

24:57.262 --> 24:59.936
<i>Carry them here and there
jumping o'er times</i>

24:59.998 --> 25:03.605
<i>Turning the accomplishment
of many years into an hour-glass</i>

25:04.569 --> 25:08.984
<i>For the which supply, admit me</i>

25:09.574 --> 25:11.952
<i>Who prologue-like your humble
patience pray</i>

25:12.010 --> 25:15.321
<i>Gently to hear, kindly to judge</i>

25:15.413 --> 25:16.790
<i>Our play</i>

25:48.847 --> 25:50.986
- Let's try again.
- The same?

25:51.316 --> 25:53.387
Yes, but with another tune.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.553
Let's see.

25:55.120 --> 25:58.329
Just like before,
once it's set up, you start.

26:03.795 --> 26:04.796
Wait.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.499
I'll put more reverb.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.871
<i>Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of Navarre?</i>

26:38.396 --> 26:41.741
<i>Since a crooked figure may
attest in little place a million</i>

26:42.167 --> 26:44.443
<i>And let us, ciphers to this great accompt</i>

26:44.536 --> 26:46.948
<i>On your imaginary forces work</i>

26:47.038 --> 26:48.779
<i>Suppose within the girdle of these voices</i>

26:48.873 --> 26:51.183
<i>Are now confined seven mighty lovers</i>

26:51.242 --> 26:54.246
<i>Piece out our imperfections
with your thoughts</i>

26:54.346 --> 26:55.586
<i>Convert me into a princess</i>

26:55.680 --> 26:58.024
<i>And tum the six remaining ladies
into six proud men</i>

26:58.083 --> 27:02.259
<i>For 'tis your thoughts that
now must deck our kings</i>

27:02.354 --> 27:04.925
<i>Carry them here and there
jumping o'er times</i>

27:05.023 --> 27:07.128
<i>Turning the accomplishment
of many years...</i>

27:08.293 --> 27:09.966
- Was it him?
- Yes, but he played dumb.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.233
He may not remember.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.606
I thought the same
but he never looked at me.

27:13.698 --> 27:15.769
No, that's something else.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.744
Isn't it strange not to have
looked at least once?

27:17.802 --> 27:19.713
He's not doing very well these days.

27:19.771 --> 27:20.977
Is he depressed?

27:21.072 --> 27:24.315
He doesn't want much contact with anyone,
much less with women.

27:24.409 --> 27:25.547
Have I scared him?

27:25.610 --> 27:28.056
I don't think so. It's more general.

27:28.446 --> 27:30.187
- What are you looking for?
- The razor.

27:32.884 --> 27:33.885
There.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.498
How long will he stay here?

27:37.622 --> 27:38.930
I don't know.

27:39.958 --> 27:42.962
If we sleep in the same bed,
we'll have to talk at some point.

27:43.061 --> 27:44.062
Does it worry you?

27:44.129 --> 27:47.440
If he's sensitive about it,
you should ask him.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.979
What's Guillermo doing tonight?

27:50.035 --> 27:51.378
He's sleeping over here.

27:51.736 --> 27:52.976
You thought he was seeing someone else.

27:53.071 --> 27:54.675
He said he wanted to talk.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.184
And that worries you?

27:56.274 --> 27:58.151
No, it actually relieves me a bit.

27:59.477 --> 28:01.354
When did you meet Victor?

28:01.446 --> 28:03.585
Some time ago but I still remember it.

28:04.282 --> 28:08.424
When I replaced Natalia in the play,
he was leaving, too.

28:16.828 --> 28:18.830
<i>That night we were gazing
at each other the whole time.</i>

28:18.930 --> 28:21.001
<i>Me, on one side and he, on the other side.</i>

28:21.099 --> 28:23.943
<i>I was dancing with some friends,
but he kept his distance.</i>

28:24.002 --> 28:26.004
<i>A song by the Beach Boys started playing.</i>

28:26.104 --> 28:28.015
<i>I think it was Surfin' USA.</i>

28:28.106 --> 28:31.144
<i>He smiled a little
and began to dance next to me.</i>

28:31.209 --> 28:34.019
<i>It was clear that at some point
we were going to kiss and all,</i>

28:34.112 --> 28:35.819
<i>but there was no hurry.</i>

28:36.448 --> 28:38.689
<i>Suddenly, a bunch of chicks
began to circle him.</i>

28:38.783 --> 28:41.855
<i>No idea if his girlfriend was one of them</i>

28:41.953 --> 28:45.162
<i>but he was uncomfortable around them.</i>

28:45.223 --> 28:47.726
<i>They finally took him away
and I never saw him again</i>

28:47.826 --> 28:49.806
<i>that night or any other.</i>

28:49.861 --> 28:51.499
<i>They made me feel pretty bad.</i>

28:51.563 --> 28:53.804
<i>But the song was still on
and so I told myself,</i>

28:53.865 --> 28:55.708
<i>"Fine, one more dance and I'll head home."</i>

30:10.542 --> 30:14.080
- Is this my room?
- Yes, we'll share it.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.647
- Here are the sheets.
- Thanks.

30:15.747 --> 30:18.227
- And this?
- It was in the studio.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.132
That's mine. Thank you.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.256
Nice drawings.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.995
- Did you like them?
- Yes.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.793
- It's us.
- Let me see.

30:27.892 --> 30:29.166
Yes.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.933
I hope I didn't bother you.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.770
I didn't even notice you were there.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.469
You always do naked pictures?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.477
They're just sketches.
Keep them if you like.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.569
No, they're yours.

30:37.635 --> 30:39.637
Carla told me you've met before.

30:39.704 --> 30:40.910
Yes, but not really.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.178
I thought you wouldn't remember.

30:42.273 --> 30:44.514
We were drunk but I still remember.

30:44.609 --> 30:45.815
You'll have to share the bed

30:45.877 --> 30:48.414
unless one of you prefers to sleep
on the floor.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.186
- Fine by me.
- For me, too.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.784
Just in case anyone gets shy.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.421
Or frightened.

30:54.485 --> 30:55.623
Frightened?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.963
I told Carla about your promise.

30:58.223 --> 31:00.533
- What promise?
- No more women.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.132
No, it is not so.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.299
But I have too much work
and too little time.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.206
I hope I didn't freak you out.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.504
It's okay.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.511
Great. You two stay here, then.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.842
Which side do you prefer?

31:11.936 --> 31:13.108
The right.

31:13.171 --> 31:14.206
Good.

31:14.305 --> 31:17.309
Tomorrow I can find
another place to sleep.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.348
It's okay for me.

31:19.444 --> 31:20.946
Your boyfriend doesn't need to know.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.014
He can get rather jealous.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.887
And he's heard about Victor's history.

31:26.050 --> 31:30.465
My history has been sort of damaged lately
so you can tell him whatever you want.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.157
What about your girlfriend?

31:32.223 --> 31:34.169
- Paula?
- Yes, your girlfriend.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.795
She's traveling.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.464
Haven't seen her yet?

31:37.528 --> 31:39.565
No, she'll be back the day after tomorrow.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.872
And you're okay waiting
for her to come back?

31:41.966 --> 31:42.967
Yes.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.473
You seem changed.

31:45.536 --> 31:46.571
You noticed?

31:46.671 --> 31:49.379
Nothing happened that night, did it?

31:49.741 --> 31:51.982
I don't know. I don't remember much.

31:52.343 --> 31:53.720
Neither do I.

31:54.012 --> 31:56.014
Tonight we know at least.

31:56.714 --> 31:58.125
So it seems.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.387
Let's leave everything
for another time, then.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.488
Are you working all night?

32:03.554 --> 32:06.831
I'd rather get up early.
What "everything"?

32:07.091 --> 32:09.731
Everything that might happen
the next time we meet

32:09.827 --> 32:13.502
when we'll be neither the ones we were,
nor the ones we are now.

32:13.698 --> 32:17.043
If we've met a second time,
there's sure to be a third one.

32:17.201 --> 32:21.047
And maybe then, you'll be less busy
and I'll have no boyfriend.

32:21.339 --> 32:22.409
Who knows?

32:22.507 --> 32:23.952
Yes, who knows? We'll see.

32:24.042 --> 32:26.022
We'll see how we are then.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.354
I'm the same as before.

32:28.680 --> 32:33.186
Before I didn't know you,
but now you don't seem so bad.

32:33.418 --> 32:35.694
But, in a while, who knows?

32:36.254 --> 32:39.098
You think it's better to let
whatever's going to happen happen?

32:39.190 --> 32:40.931
No, not at all.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.062
"Whatever" can be not much.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.538
There is already something.

32:44.595 --> 32:45.596
Yes, a mess.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.199
Whose is this?

32:47.865 --> 32:49.708
Guillermo's, I think.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.070
I have the very same one.

32:55.540 --> 32:59.716
Why don't we leave this for later
and you sleep on the floor?

33:00.845 --> 33:02.085
Either way.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.025
Sleeping together might damage our future.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.255
It'd be a shame.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.263
I can sleep with Jimena
and you with Guillermo.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.299
I'll sleep on the floor.

33:10.888 --> 33:12.094
Done, then.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.301
Will I be able to be in the play?

33:15.393 --> 33:17.839
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to Natalia yet.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.636
No one knows exactly how to contact her.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.574
Everybody was happy when I replaced her.

33:21.632 --> 33:22.804
Yes, I know.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.574
Even Natalia said that
I did it better than she did.

33:25.636 --> 33:27.138
Did she see you in the play?

33:27.238 --> 33:29.809
Yes, but after that night,
we never saw her again.

33:30.408 --> 33:32.388
Was the play taped this year?

33:32.443 --> 33:34.787
Yes, I should have a DVD somewhere.

33:36.114 --> 33:38.287
Has anyone seen Paula lately?

33:38.349 --> 33:39.350
No.

33:43.788 --> 33:45.324
Do you want the DVD?

33:47.492 --> 33:48.698
Victor.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.238
From Paula to Guillermo with love

33:51.329 --> 33:52.449
What are you thinking about?

33:52.563 --> 33:53.940
Victor.

33:53.998 --> 33:55.773
You know he's back, don't you?

33:55.933 --> 33:56.934
No.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.938
- Is he?
- Yes.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.480
Why were you thinking about him?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.349
He crossed my mind when I saw you.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.477
PRIVATE LESSONS

34:05.543 --> 34:08.683
He got some money in Mexico
to do something with the play.

34:08.746 --> 34:09.746
I see.

34:09.813 --> 34:10.815
He hasn't called me yet.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.384
He told Carla.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.963
He must have thought
you didn't want to do it again.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.291
Well, you ran away.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.797
But he could have asked me.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.975
- People change, don't they?
- Yes, maybe.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.705
Do you have his phone number?

34:32.804 --> 34:34.511
He doesn't use one.

34:35.039 --> 34:36.643
Do you know where he's staying?

34:36.706 --> 34:38.914
Now at Jimena and Carla's.

34:39.043 --> 34:40.443
You've all gotten together already?

34:40.478 --> 34:42.355
I met him on my own.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.489
If you meet him again,
tell him to write to me.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.654
Okay.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.059
There aren't many people around here.

34:51.155 --> 34:52.998
Because they're on vacation now.

34:53.056 --> 34:56.561
But there's a school here,
and another one there.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.669
And Guillermo's number?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.244
Yes, but he won't pick up.

35:03.334 --> 35:04.369
How's that?

35:04.435 --> 35:06.073
He's in the club.

35:06.337 --> 35:08.078
- Same club as always?
- Yes.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.742
- Still going there?
- Yes.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.185
- He hasn't changed much.
- No.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.413
He's with Victor?

35:14.512 --> 35:15.889
No, no idea.

35:17.081 --> 35:18.526
How do I get to the club?

35:18.583 --> 35:19.743
If I were you, I wouldn't go.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.189
Natalia!

36:26.284 --> 36:28.127
Hello. How are you?

36:28.920 --> 36:30.922
- Are you with Victor?
- No.

36:30.988 --> 36:32.058
He's gone?

36:32.123 --> 36:33.966
He hasn't lived here in awhile.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.005
No, I know but he came back.

36:36.093 --> 36:37.094
I see.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.368
He left his backpack here.

36:39.497 --> 36:40.498
No, that's mine.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.202
- The black one?
- Yes.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.507
But it looks like the one I once gave him.

36:44.769 --> 36:45.770
I see.

36:46.437 --> 36:48.474
And you are here by yourself?

36:48.606 --> 36:49.607
Yes.

36:50.107 --> 36:52.018
Do you have his phone number?

36:52.343 --> 36:54.516
I have his old one
but I don't think he's using it.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.489
The one he used a year ago?

36:56.781 --> 36:59.125
- Yes.
- No, he's not using it.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.188
Or he's not picking up for you.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.494
Are you looking forward to
walking out on him again?

37:05.556 --> 37:08.127
I don't get why you're
so aggressive with me.

37:08.859 --> 37:10.065
It's been a while
since we last saw each other.

37:10.127 --> 37:12.971
Why don't you ask me
how I'm doing or something?

37:14.732 --> 37:16.302
You didn't ask me either.

37:17.301 --> 37:18.609
Fine.

37:18.669 --> 37:20.080
How are you?

37:20.304 --> 37:21.806
Fantastic. And you?

37:21.872 --> 37:23.283
Pretty bad, actually.

37:23.341 --> 37:24.752
I see.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.156
And why don't you care?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.359
I just don't.

37:31.716 --> 37:33.821
But I'm being honest.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.158
So am I.

37:37.154 --> 37:38.758
Any idea where I could I find him?

37:38.856 --> 37:39.857
Ask Paula.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.438
No, I can't. Paula's mad at me.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.039
Naturally.

37:45.363 --> 37:47.843
Come on. It's really important.

37:48.532 --> 37:50.671
I want to be back in the play.

37:53.704 --> 37:56.344
You know something. Give me his number.

37:56.574 --> 37:57.917
What are you doing here?

37:58.009 --> 38:00.046
- Victor used to come here.
- When?

38:00.111 --> 38:01.920
Back then he was either with me or here.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.356
That was over a year ago.

38:03.414 --> 38:05.917
People change.
He surely has a new girl now.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.052
I'm doing pretty much the same thing.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.429
That's why it may be better
not to give you his number.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.859
Don't get in between us.
Let me talk to him.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.868
You're thinking of a Victor
that no longer exists.

38:20.097 --> 38:21.576
Don't touch me.

38:21.999 --> 38:23.501
You don't touch me.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.009
What are you thinking about?

38:25.870 --> 38:27.042
Victor.

38:27.705 --> 38:28.775
You know he's back, don't you?

38:28.873 --> 38:31.376
- No. Is he?
- Yes.

38:31.575 --> 38:32.883
Why were you thinking about him?

38:32.943 --> 38:35.389
He crossed my mind when I saw you.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.754
He got some money in Mexico
to do something with the play.

38:38.949 --> 38:40.895
PRIVATE LESSONS

38:41.052 --> 38:42.929
He hasn't called me yet.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.100
I think he called Carla.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.931
He must have thought
you didn't want to do it again.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.233
You ran away.

38:50.294 --> 38:52.399
But he could have asked me.

38:52.463 --> 38:53.908
People change, don't they?

38:53.964 --> 38:55.341
Yes, maybe.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.477
- Do you have his number?
- Yes.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.482
Why do you want it?

39:01.639 --> 39:04.620
I'll ask him if I can be
in the play again.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.656
- Maybe Carla won't mind.
- I don't know.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.625
It wouldn't hurt to try.

39:10.748 --> 39:13.592
Right now Carla is having a hard time.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.860
Same here.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.164
May I have his number, please?

39:22.093 --> 39:23.766
Write it down.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.163
No.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.573
- Just tell me.
- You sure?

39:27.631 --> 39:28.837
Yes. I'll memorize it.

39:28.899 --> 39:31.277
- No, use mine.
- You sure?

39:31.335 --> 39:32.643
I'll be brief.

39:57.862 --> 40:00.433
Ana told me about
the new job for the play.

40:00.498 --> 40:02.569
- Yes.
- I thought of something.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.843
- What do you want?
- She says there's money.

40:04.902 --> 40:05.937
Yes.

40:06.003 --> 40:08.882
These months have been
pretty tough for me.

40:08.973 --> 40:11.476
The private lessons aren't going so well.

40:12.042 --> 40:13.385
I see. I already spoke to Carla.

40:13.477 --> 40:14.581
You saw her already?

40:14.678 --> 40:16.351
Yes. She showed me a DVD.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.655
- Did you like it?
- Yes.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.491
I thought we could tell her
to do some other part

40:20.551 --> 40:22.326
so we could both be in it.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.660
What do you want me to tell you?

40:24.822 --> 40:26.665
That there's no problem with it.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.498
That I still think about you.

40:28.659 --> 40:29.831
Still sore?

40:29.894 --> 40:30.998
No, still fine.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.165
I'm pretty bad.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.574
What do you want me to tell you?

40:35.633 --> 40:37.340
Can I have Carla's number?

40:37.401 --> 40:38.402
Why?

40:39.103 --> 40:41.913
To call her, and explain to her
that it's nothing personal against her,

40:42.006 --> 40:43.883
but a favor between us.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.085
Can I have her number?

40:46.544 --> 40:48.182
- I won't give it to you.
- Why?

40:48.245 --> 40:49.246
Because.

40:49.847 --> 40:51.758
If I explain it to her, she'll understand.

40:52.216 --> 40:54.096
I've already talked to her.
I want her to do it.

40:54.151 --> 40:55.892
But let me speak to her.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.091
She's been doing it for a year.
I can't kick her out.

40:59.156 --> 41:00.396
Will you perform?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.062
No, Guillermo is doing it.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.367
I won't kick him out
only because I'm back.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.432
And what are you doing?

41:06.530 --> 41:07.531
Everything else.

41:07.598 --> 41:09.703
What's all that about her
spending a year doing it?

41:09.767 --> 41:11.144
I have the same reasons.

41:11.235 --> 41:12.543
It's not the same.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.544
It's not the same, I need it much more.

41:16.540 --> 41:17.575
In your opinion.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.279
In my opinion, it's vital...

41:19.376 --> 41:20.787
- Fine.
- Lend me your phone.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.949
Stop it. Call her from yours.

41:23.047 --> 41:25.721
I have no phone. I told you I'm broke.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.091
What's that face?

41:31.155 --> 41:32.828
- It's over.
- What's over?

41:32.890 --> 41:34.961
- This is over.
- Let me see.

41:35.059 --> 41:36.179
What are you thinking about?

41:36.327 --> 41:37.328
Victor.

41:37.394 --> 41:39.396
- You know he's back, don't you?
- No.

41:39.463 --> 41:40.464
Is he?

41:40.631 --> 41:41.632
Yes.

41:41.732 --> 41:43.302
Why were you thinking about him?

41:43.400 --> 41:45.505
He crossed my mind when I saw you.

41:45.603 --> 41:48.812
He got some money in Mexico
to do something with the play.

41:48.906 --> 41:50.476
PRIVATE LESSONS

41:51.242 --> 41:52.687
He hasn't called me yet.

41:52.776 --> 41:54.653
I think he told Carla.

41:55.145 --> 41:58.786
He must have thought
you didn't want to do it again.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.851
You ran away, didn't you?

42:02.286 --> 42:04.288
But he could have asked me.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.665
People change, don't they?

42:06.757 --> 42:08.430
Yes, maybe.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.442
Do you have his number?

42:20.304 --> 42:22.113
How are you, Victor?

42:22.206 --> 42:23.310
Fine.

42:23.507 --> 42:24.781
And you?

42:25.175 --> 42:26.279
Yes.

42:26.677 --> 42:28.554
She's here with me.

42:28.612 --> 42:29.886
Okay. Here she is.

42:29.947 --> 42:30.948
Kiss. Bye.

42:31.448 --> 42:32.552
It's for you.

42:32.650 --> 42:33.822
Hello.

42:34.118 --> 42:35.188
Yes.

42:35.352 --> 42:36.990
How did you know?

42:37.688 --> 42:39.031
Telepathy.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.533
Yes, in the street.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.498
No, nothing in particular.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.044
Yes, I could.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.343
Great. Meet you there.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.071
Kiss.

43:08.018 --> 43:10.225
- I was just thinking of you.
- Why?

43:10.988 --> 43:12.899
I have an offer for you.

43:12.990 --> 43:16.267
There might be a job
for a few months for everybody.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.395
The radio gig?

43:17.494 --> 43:18.666
You heard about it?

43:18.729 --> 43:20.208
Yes, excellent.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.743
Just what I needed.

43:21.832 --> 43:24.506
But you're playing another part
because Carla's doing yours.

43:24.568 --> 43:26.514
I know. It's all right.

43:26.570 --> 43:28.277
I need to ask you two favors.

43:28.372 --> 43:29.373
Tell me.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.886
May I stay at your place tomorrow night?

43:31.942 --> 43:33.546
Yes, of course.

43:33.611 --> 43:37.923
I'm homeless till Paula gets back,
and there's no room at Jimena's.

43:39.883 --> 43:40.884
Thank you.

43:41.185 --> 43:42.960
And the other favor?

43:43.687 --> 43:46.031
Meet Paula and give this to her.

43:48.626 --> 43:49.696
From Paula to Guillermo with love

43:49.760 --> 43:50.761
Here, check it out.

43:50.861 --> 43:51.896
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST

43:57.768 --> 43:59.770
You'll see me there.

44:00.104 --> 44:02.584
And Guillermo, too, playing the Princess.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.710
Have you ever seen him?

44:03.774 --> 44:07.051
Just a couple of rehearsals,
never an entire show.

44:08.045 --> 44:10.150
If you like it, I'll join in.

44:10.247 --> 44:12.056
I'd love to do it.

44:12.116 --> 44:14.062
Yes, it would be great.

44:14.451 --> 44:16.795
I'm sure it'd be great if you all do it.

44:17.221 --> 44:19.633
Aren't you tempted to
do it again yourself?

44:19.723 --> 44:21.225
What? To act?

44:21.291 --> 44:23.134
You did it for so long.

44:23.227 --> 44:25.571
I'd rather have Guillermo do it.

44:26.230 --> 44:28.437
How beautiful Paula was here.

44:30.401 --> 44:31.846
It's Natalia.

44:32.403 --> 44:35.145
- Moreno?
- Yes, she's asking for you.

44:35.973 --> 44:38.510
It's Ana's number,
but it's signed by Natalia.

44:38.609 --> 44:42.147
She says that if I'm with you,
you should call her at this number.

44:51.755 --> 44:53.098
Hello, Natalia?

44:53.157 --> 44:54.602
Victor here. How are you?

44:55.959 --> 44:57.097
Fine.

44:57.795 --> 44:59.331
I have an offer for you.

44:59.430 --> 45:02.673
There might be a job
for a few months for everyone.

45:02.966 --> 45:04.843
You already know?

45:05.002 --> 45:07.608
You're playing another part,
because Carla's doing yours.

45:07.671 --> 45:09.446
I need to ask you two favors.

45:09.506 --> 45:13.283
Can I stay at your place tomorrow night?
I have to record something with Guillermo.

45:13.777 --> 45:15.120
Excellent.

45:15.212 --> 45:18.659
And then, something else,
I need you to give something to Paula.

45:19.650 --> 45:22.392
No, I'm not telling you what.
It's a surprise.

45:23.487 --> 45:25.990
Not for you, silly. For Paula.

45:37.668 --> 45:39.045
Is Paula coming back to town?

45:39.136 --> 45:41.844
Yes, I'm coming. What are you doing?

45:41.905 --> 45:43.816
- No. What are you doing?
- My bag.

45:43.874 --> 45:46.150
I prepared it so as not to be suspected.

45:46.210 --> 45:48.087
- What a fool.
- Yes, I know.

45:48.178 --> 45:50.681
But today I'll meet him
and tell him everything.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.888
- It's about time.
- I left it till the last day.

45:53.984 --> 45:55.861
But today I'll tell him everything.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.227
I love you.

46:41.765 --> 46:42.800
Hi.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.917
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

46:49.973 --> 46:50.974
Fine.

46:53.911 --> 46:54.912
Recording.

46:55.913 --> 46:57.756
And till that instant
shut my woeful self up

46:57.815 --> 46:59.294
in a mourning house,
raining the tears of lamentation

46:59.383 --> 47:02.227
for the remembrance of my father's death.

47:02.653 --> 47:05.293
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,

47:05.389 --> 47:08.097
neither entitled in the other's heart.

47:09.426 --> 47:10.427
Good.

47:10.794 --> 47:11.966
Again.

47:13.063 --> 47:14.406
And till that instant
shut my woeful self up

47:14.464 --> 47:15.909
in a mourning house,
raining the tears of lamentation

47:15.966 --> 47:18.310
for the remembrance of my father's death.

47:19.069 --> 47:21.845
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,

47:21.939 --> 47:24.579
neither entitled in the other's heart.

47:25.976 --> 47:28.252
- Again.
- Same way?

47:28.312 --> 47:29.916
Yes, again.

47:30.414 --> 47:31.984
And till that instant
shut my woeful self up

47:32.082 --> 47:33.993
in a mourning house,
raining the tears of lamentation

47:34.084 --> 47:36.758
for the remembrance of my father's death.

47:37.254 --> 47:39.666
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,

47:39.756 --> 47:42.100
neither entitled in the other's heart.

47:44.161 --> 47:45.162
Again.

47:46.630 --> 47:48.041
And till that instant
shut my woeful self up

47:48.131 --> 47:50.133
in a mourning house,
raining the tears of lamentation

47:50.200 --> 47:52.703
for the remembrance of my father's death.

47:53.437 --> 47:55.348
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,

47:55.439 --> 47:58.113
neither entitled in the other's heart.

48:00.544 --> 48:01.545
Enough.

48:02.279 --> 48:03.485
I'd try it a few times more.

48:03.547 --> 48:05.049
I should have left an hour ago.

48:05.148 --> 48:06.559
You could continue some other day.

48:06.650 --> 48:09.358
I think it's better to finish it today.

48:09.453 --> 48:11.296
One more. Last one.

48:16.526 --> 48:17.869
Recording.

48:18.395 --> 48:19.897
And till that instant
shut my woeful self up

48:19.997 --> 48:21.670
in a mourning house,
raining the tears of lamentation

48:21.732 --> 48:24.303
for the remembrance of my father's death.

48:24.968 --> 48:27.676
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,

48:27.738 --> 48:30.082
neither entitled in the other's heart.

48:33.310 --> 48:34.516
I'll get the door for you.

48:41.485 --> 48:43.692
- Bye.
- Bye.

49:12.449 --> 49:14.554
Okay. Let's do another one.

49:18.855 --> 49:21.233
Wind and foliage.

49:31.802 --> 49:32.974
Pause.

49:33.070 --> 49:34.549
A stronger one.

49:37.207 --> 49:38.481
Stronger.

49:41.244 --> 49:42.382
Fine.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.057
The letters.

49:44.948 --> 49:46.325
We need to tear some paper.

49:46.416 --> 49:48.726
- May I use those?
- Sure.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.494
They are Natalia's. Is that okay?

49:52.589 --> 49:54.227
Yes, it's okay.

49:59.963 --> 50:01.499
Enraged letter.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.419
Paper ball.

50:18.448 --> 50:19.950
A faster ball.

50:22.786 --> 50:23.958
Again.

50:24.354 --> 50:27.301
- Similar to that one?
- Like this.

50:31.094 --> 50:32.095
Good.

50:32.496 --> 50:34.169
Now you record me.

50:43.707 --> 50:44.947
Thunder.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.731
We have received
your letters <i>full</i> of love.

50:55.819 --> 50:56.820
What's this?

50:56.887 --> 50:58.457
We have received
your letters <i>full</i> of love.

50:58.522 --> 51:00.126
Yeah, cut it out.

51:00.190 --> 51:01.191
Let me listen.

51:01.291 --> 51:02.634
It's our text.

51:02.692 --> 51:03.830
Yes, now cut it out.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.875
I can't believe it.
Did you tape everything?

51:06.963 --> 51:08.033
Sit down.

51:08.398 --> 51:13.245
And, in our maiden council,
rated them at... Fuck!

51:13.637 --> 51:14.638
Nice.

51:14.704 --> 51:18.345
<i>A time, methinks, too short
to make a world-without-end bargain in.</i>

51:19.342 --> 51:22.551
<i>No, no, my lord,
your grace is perjured much,</i>

51:22.646 --> 51:24.592
<i>full of dear guiltiness,
and therefore this.</i>

51:24.681 --> 51:28.060
<i>If for my love, as there is no such cause,</i>

51:28.418 --> 51:31.490
<i>you will do aught,
this shall you do for me,</i>

51:31.555 --> 51:34.035
<i>your oath I will not trust,
but go with speed</i>

51:34.091 --> 51:36.093
<i>to some forlorn and naked hermitage,</i>

51:36.193 --> 51:38.366
<i>remote from all the pleasures
of the world.</i>

51:38.428 --> 51:40.738
<i>There stay until the twelve
celestial signs</i>

51:40.831 --> 51:43.072
<i>have brought about the annual reckoning.</i>

51:43.166 --> 51:44.577
<i>If this austere insociable life</i>

51:44.668 --> 51:47.012
<i>change not your offer made
in heat of blood,</i>

51:47.070 --> 51:49.550
<i>if frosts and fasts, hard lodging
and thin weeds</i>

51:49.606 --> 51:52.416
<i>nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,</i>

51:52.509 --> 51:54.887
<i>but that it bear this trial and last love.</i>

51:54.945 --> 51:56.754
<i>Then, at the expiration of the year,</i>

51:56.847 --> 52:00.522
<i>come challenge me, challenge me
by these deserts.</i>

52:00.917 --> 52:04.797
<i>And, by this virgin palm
now kissing thine,</i>

52:05.055 --> 52:07.092
<i>I will be thine, and till that
instant shut my woeful self up</i>

52:07.190 --> 52:09.101
<i>in a mourning house,
raining the tears of lamentation</i>

52:09.192 --> 52:10.899
<i>for the remembrance of my father's death.</i>

52:10.961 --> 52:13.635
<i>If this thou do deny, let our hands part,</i>

52:13.730 --> 52:16.973
<i>neither entitled in the other's heart.</i>

52:18.068 --> 52:19.308
I love you.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.749
Yesterday I was going to end things
with Victor, but I didn't.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.656
Guillermo got mad,
and left me alone with him,

52:31.748 --> 52:34.627
giving me a second chance to do it.

52:34.718 --> 52:36.322
But I don't know.

52:36.786 --> 52:38.424
I realized that when I'm with him,

52:38.488 --> 52:41.469
it's not that I am not brave enough

52:41.558 --> 52:43.060
but that I don't want to.

52:43.126 --> 52:44.503
Because as soon as I saw Guillermo again,

52:44.594 --> 52:47.302
I could tell him easily not to meet again.

52:47.397 --> 52:49.399
- So? Off to Mexico?
- Yes, I'm leaving.

52:49.466 --> 52:52.970
- And all of a sudden?
- It took me a year to decide.

52:53.069 --> 52:54.605
- Yes, that's true.
- A lot of time.

52:54.671 --> 52:56.480
- Jimena's down there?
- No idea.

52:56.573 --> 52:58.348
- Can we hold the text?
- I think so.

52:58.441 --> 52:59.442
But you know it.

52:59.509 --> 53:01.079
Yes, some I do.

53:02.312 --> 53:03.814
Victor says we should go down.

53:03.914 --> 53:05.655
- We're all set?
- Yes.

53:06.650 --> 53:08.493
- Did you bring me the keys?
- What keys?

53:08.585 --> 53:10.929
- Mine.
- No. Victor must have them.

53:11.955 --> 53:14.196
- Here's what you left.
- What?

53:19.429 --> 53:21.705
- Did you use my flyers?
- What flyers?

53:21.798 --> 53:25.507
- For my private lessons.
- Victor said that we could use them.

53:25.602 --> 53:28.481
- You tore them all.
- We only used a couple.

53:28.538 --> 53:29.710
<i>Victor,</i>

53:29.806 --> 53:32.150
<i>seeing you so suddenly talking about Paula</i>

53:32.209 --> 53:34.485
<i>made me understand
how little is left of me in you</i>

53:34.544 --> 53:36.046
<i>without her in the middle.</i>

53:36.146 --> 53:38.524
<i>I think it's better to do as
you said a while ago,</i>

53:38.615 --> 53:40.959
<i>focus on the play
and allow yourself to forget</i>

53:41.017 --> 53:42.997
<i>this less than perfect moment.</i>

53:43.053 --> 53:45.966
<i>Leave the keys on the table.
Do not come back.</i>

53:46.022 --> 53:48.059
<i>And see you in the recording.</i>

53:48.158 --> 53:49.228
<i>Ana.</i>

53:49.359 --> 53:51.862
Silvio, thy love is far from charity.

53:51.962 --> 53:54.568
You may look pale,
but I should blush, I know.

53:54.664 --> 53:59.409
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.

54:02.973 --> 54:04.975
Come, Olivia, you blush,
as his your case is such.

54:05.041 --> 54:08.648
You chide at him, offending twice as much.

54:08.712 --> 54:10.714
You do not love a younger fellow.

54:10.814 --> 54:12.851
I have been closely shrouded in this bush

54:12.916 --> 54:15.089
and mark'd you both
and for you both did blush,

54:15.185 --> 54:17.756
I heard your guilty rhymes,
observed your fashion,

54:17.854 --> 54:20.858
saw sighs reek from you,
noted well your passion.

54:20.924 --> 54:24.565
"Ay me!" says one.
"O Jove!" the other cries.

54:24.661 --> 54:28.108
What will Antonio say when
that he shall hear faith so infringed?

54:28.198 --> 54:31.702
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.

54:31.768 --> 54:34.442
Good heart, what grace hast thou,
thus to reprove these worms for loving,

54:34.537 --> 54:35.914
for loving, that art most in love?

54:36.006 --> 54:39.215
But are you not ashamed?

54:39.276 --> 54:42.120
Are you not all three of you,
to be thus much o'ershot?

54:42.212 --> 54:44.089
What a scene of foolery have I seen,

54:44.180 --> 54:47.024
of sighs, of groans,
of sorrow and of teen!

54:47.083 --> 54:50.530
Tell me, gentle Bassanio,
where lies thy grief?

54:50.754 --> 54:52.756
Where lies thy pain, Olivia?

54:52.856 --> 54:55.132
And yours Silvius?

54:55.225 --> 54:59.731
All about the breast, a caudle, ho!

55:00.030 --> 55:03.273
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?

55:03.366 --> 55:06.313
Not you to me, but I betray'd by you,

55:06.403 --> 55:10.374
I am betray'd, by keeping company
with men like men of inconstancy.

55:10.874 --> 55:13.480
When shall you see me write
a thing in rhyme?

55:13.576 --> 55:16.716
Or groan for love?
Or spend a minute's time in pruning me?

55:16.780 --> 55:19.386
When shall you hear that I
will praise a hand,

55:19.449 --> 55:20.655
a foot, a face, an eye,

55:20.750 --> 55:25.290
a gait, a state, a brow, a breast,
a waist, a leg, a limb?

55:25.755 --> 55:27.962
Soft! Whither away so fast?

55:28.058 --> 55:34.134
A true man or a thief that gallops so?

55:34.230 --> 55:37.507
I post from love, good lover, let me go.

55:39.269 --> 55:41.146
God bless the king!

55:41.237 --> 55:42.682
What present hast thou there?

55:42.772 --> 55:44.149
Some certain treason.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.242
What makes treason here?

55:46.910 --> 55:48.150
Nay, it makes nothing, sir.

55:48.244 --> 55:51.248
The treason and you go in
peace away together.

55:51.614 --> 55:54.322
I beseech your grace,
let this letter be read,

55:54.417 --> 55:56.988
our parson misdoubts it,
'twas treason, he said.

55:57.087 --> 56:00.261
Antonio, read it over.
Where hadst thou it?

56:00.457 --> 56:03.438
- Of Costard.
- Of Dun Adramadio.

56:07.997 --> 56:10.273
Have you written all this?

56:11.835 --> 56:13.371
What is in you?

56:13.603 --> 56:14.843
Why dost thou tear it?

56:14.938 --> 56:17.612
A toy, a toy, you need not fear it.

56:17.674 --> 56:19.676
It did move him to passion,

56:19.776 --> 56:21.847
and therefore let's hear it.

56:21.945 --> 56:25.017
It is Antonio's writing,
and here is his name.

56:25.115 --> 56:27.391
You whoreson loggerhead!

56:27.484 --> 56:29.691
You were born to do me shame.

56:31.488 --> 56:33.229
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess.

56:33.289 --> 56:34.632
What?

56:34.691 --> 56:38.468
That you three fools lack'd me
fool to make up the mess,

56:38.695 --> 56:42.142
he, she, and you, and I,
are pick-purses in love,

56:42.198 --> 56:43.802
and we deserve to die.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.071
Now the number is even.

56:46.169 --> 56:47.204
True, true, we are four.

56:47.303 --> 56:49.010
Will these turtles be gone?

56:49.072 --> 56:50.745
Hence, sirs, away!

56:50.874 --> 56:54.686
Walk aside the true folk,
and let the traitors stay.

56:57.514 --> 56:59.084
Sweet lords, sweet lovers,

56:59.182 --> 57:00.991
O, let us embrace!

57:01.050 --> 57:04.691
As true we are as flesh and blood can be,

57:04.754 --> 57:07.428
young blood doth not obey an old decree.

57:07.524 --> 57:09.936
We cannot cross the cause
why we were born.

57:10.026 --> 57:13.337
What, did these rent lines show
some love of thine?

57:13.396 --> 57:15.342
Did they, quoth you?

57:15.398 --> 57:19.073
Who sees the heavenly love,
that, like a rude and savage man of Inde,

57:19.169 --> 57:21.581
bows not his vassal head
and strucken blind

57:21.671 --> 57:24.083
kisses the base ground
with obedient breast?

57:24.174 --> 57:27.917
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
dares look upon the heaven of her brow,

57:28.011 --> 57:29.854
that is not blinded by her majesty?

57:30.513 --> 57:32.720
What zeal, what fury hath inspired
thee now?

57:32.782 --> 57:34.352
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

57:34.417 --> 57:36.727
Are we not all in love?

57:36.853 --> 57:38.594
Nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworn.

57:38.688 --> 57:42.397
Then leave this chat, and,
Antonio, now prove our loving lawful,

57:42.459 --> 57:43.870
and our faith not torn.

57:43.927 --> 57:45.736
Ay, marry, there,
some flattery for this evil.

57:45.795 --> 57:49.607
Some tricks, some quillets,
how to cheat the devil.

57:49.699 --> 57:52.976
- Some salve for perjury.
- 'Tis more than need.

57:53.069 --> 57:54.412
Shut up.

57:54.904 --> 57:57.111
Have at you, then,
affection's men at arms.

57:57.207 --> 57:59.881
Consider what you first did swear unto,

58:00.043 --> 58:03.252
to fast, to study, and to see no woman,

58:03.780 --> 58:06.283
flat treason 'gainst
the kingly state of youth.

58:06.416 --> 58:07.417
Say, can you fast?

58:08.451 --> 58:10.590
Your stomachs are too young,

58:10.887 --> 58:12.423
and abstinence

58:13.056 --> 58:14.797
engenders maladies.

58:15.058 --> 58:17.834
And where that you have vow'd
to study, lords,

58:17.927 --> 58:20.237
for when would you, or you, or you

58:20.296 --> 58:23.573
in leaden contemplation have
found out such fiery numbers

58:23.633 --> 58:27.240
as the prompting eyes
of beauty's tutors have enriched you with?

58:27.337 --> 58:29.749
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain.

58:29.806 --> 58:32.810
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive,

58:32.909 --> 58:35.947
from whence doth spring
the true Promethean fire.

58:36.012 --> 58:38.652
They are the ground, the books,
the academes

58:38.748 --> 58:41.592
that show, contain
and nourish all the world,

58:41.651 --> 58:44.495
else none at all in ought
proves excellent.

58:44.587 --> 58:47.124
Then fools you were
these women to forswear.

58:47.190 --> 58:49.830
For wisdom's sake,
a word that all men love.

58:49.926 --> 58:51.963
Or for love's sake,
a word that loves all men.

58:52.028 --> 58:53.769
Or for men's sake,
the authors of these women.

58:53.830 --> 58:56.140
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men.

58:56.199 --> 58:58.475
Let us once lose our oaths
to find ourselves,

58:58.535 --> 59:00.811
or else we lose ourselves
to keep our oaths.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.710
Saint Cupid, then!
And, soldiers, to the field!

59:02.772 --> 59:04.809
Advance your standards,
and upon them, lords.

59:04.874 --> 59:07.821
Pell-mell, down with them!
But be first advised.

59:07.877 --> 59:09.879
Shall we resolve to woo
these girls of France?

59:09.979 --> 59:11.788
And win them, too.

59:14.484 --> 59:16.964
- Good?
- Yes, it was okay.

59:23.159 --> 59:25.503
I heard about you and Guillermo.

59:54.324 --> 59:56.201
- Bye, Ana.
- Bye.

59:56.392 --> 59:58.394
- Goodbye, girls.
- Bye.

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:12.709
Victor!

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:14.577
Victor!

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.255
- My keys!
- What?

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.414
My keys! You have them.

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:20.894
The keys.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.522
No, Paula must have them.

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.036
Got my keys?

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:34.101
Thanks.

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.650
<i>What followed was not nice.</i>

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:56.229
<i>Paula did not come to Mexico, and
didn't want to continue with the pilot.</i>

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:59.793
<i>Despite that, I managed to assemble
the best project possible,</i>

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:02.733
<i>and two months later
I learned that it was approved.</i>

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:06.471
<i>But every time I listened to it,
when I heard her say,</i>

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:09.338
<i>”Shall we resolve to woo
these girls of France?"</i>

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:13.339
<i>couldn't help but think how
that day it should have ended.</i>

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.516
<i>I'd have preferred it
to have gone differently.</i>

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.778
<i>Something more like this.</i>

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.432
I love you.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:27.530
<i>It is not the fashion to see
the lady the epilogue,</i>

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:31.669
<i>but it is no more unhandsome
than to see the lord the prologue.</i>

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:34.941
<i>If it be true that good wine
needs no bush,</i>

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:39.214
<i>'tis true that a good play
needs no epilogue.</i>

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:42.448
<i>Yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</i>

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:45.788
<i>and good plays prove the better
by the help of good epilogues.</i>

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:48.385
<i>What a case am I in, then,
that am neither a good epilogue</i>

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:51.988
<i>nor cannot insinuate with you
in the behalf of a good play.</i>

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:55.492
<i>I</i> am not furnished like a beggar,
therefore to beg <i>will</i> not become me,

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:59.165
<i>my way is to conjure you,
and I'll begin with the women.</i>

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:02.704
<i>I charge you, 0 women,
for the love you bear to men,</i>

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:05.802
<i>to like as much of this play
as please you,</i>

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:10.078
<i>and I charge you, 0 men,
for the love you bear to women,</i>

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:13.710
<i>as I perceive by your simpering,
none of you hates them,</i>

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:17.382
<i>that between you and the women
the play may please.</i>

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.891
<i>H' I were a woman, I would kiss
as many of you as had beards</i>

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:25.591
<i>that pleased me, complexions that! liked,</i>

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.895
<i>and breaths that I defied not.</i>

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:31.597
<i>And, I am sure, as many as have
good beards, or good faces,</i>

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:33.173
<i>or sweet breaths,</i>

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.402
<i>will, for my kind offer,
when I make curtsy,</i>

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:37.500
<i>bid me farewell.</i>
