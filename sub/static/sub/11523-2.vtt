WEBVTT

00:07.215 --> 00:09.551
This is a year-round Christmas store?

00:09.718 --> 00:12.262
You must be the happiest woman on Earth!

00:12.429 --> 00:13.514
I'm a man.

00:13.681 --> 00:14.807
That's great.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.558
Anyway, I saw this...

00:16.642 --> 00:17.685
at the sign store,

00:17.768 --> 00:20.354
and I bought it to prove how serious I am

00:20.437 --> 00:21.480
about working here.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.333
Yeah, we're not really hiring. It's just...

00:23.357 --> 00:25.275
I've got a bomb!

00:26.443 --> 00:28.278
And now that I've got your attention,

00:28.445 --> 00:29.905
here's my résumé.

00:31.448 --> 00:35.744
This says you were a babysitter
from 1997 to 1998,

00:35.828 --> 00:37.496
then there's a 15-year gap...

00:37.579 --> 00:39.832
Look, I know I'm not perfect,

00:39.915 --> 00:43.335
but let me tell you about
another imperfect employee.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.128
His name was Rudolph,

00:45.212 --> 00:47.130
and he was a joke.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.801
Some say his mother made it
with a doorbell light,

00:50.885 --> 00:52.720
but when he was given a chance,

00:52.803 --> 00:54.889
Rudolph went down in history,

00:54.972 --> 00:57.641
and that reindeer's name was Rudolph.

00:57.808 --> 01:02.479
All I'm asking for is a chance
to get my life back on track.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.691
Last week, I threw myself
at a married man.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.694
I'm like a lollipop
with a question mark on its wrapper.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.779
I don't know what's going on inside.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.364
But if anything can remind me

01:12.531 --> 01:14.533
of what's good and right in the world,

01:14.616 --> 01:16.201
it's this place.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.496
They say there's a war on Christmas.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.624
Well, sir, put me on the front line,

01:22.708 --> 01:24.793
'cause if any Grinches or Scrooges

01:24.877 --> 01:26.754
dare come over that hill,

01:26.837 --> 01:30.049
I'll make them wish
they'd never been born!

01:35.220 --> 01:36.388
Oh, no.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.766
Those Santas must be
coming from a funeral.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.270
I'm so sorry for your loss, Santas.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.111
Jeepers!

01:53.072 --> 01:55.198
Why is your phone going
straight to voice mail?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.242
Jacqueline, hi! Huh?

01:57.325 --> 02:01.789
<i>So not all toxic mold is black,
but all black mold is toxic...</i>

02:01.872 --> 02:02.957
What are you doing here?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.666
I need a place to stay.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.753
I just found out my ex-husband
sold the town house.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.003
He's in escrow.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.756
Ugh. He's such an escrow.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.841
I had to clean out my closets

02:12.925 --> 02:14.635
and get the jewelry from the safe.

02:14.802 --> 02:15.922
Of course you can stay here,

02:15.970 --> 02:17.655
but wouldn't you rather
be in a fancy hotel?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.532
When I did the <i>Today </i> show,
they put me in a hotel

02:19.556 --> 02:21.600
where the hallways had trays
of free floor food.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.268
No, I can't afford that right now.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.104
But you have 12 million...

02:25.270 --> 02:27.147
You shut your wet mouth!

02:27.230 --> 02:30.025
Don't ever let anyone know
how little I got in the divorce.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.152
Now get me inside...

02:32.235 --> 02:35.196
before someone helicopters
over this neighborhood and sees me.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.160
<i>Flores!</i>

02:40.243 --> 02:43.288
<i>Flores para los muertos!</i>

02:43.371 --> 02:44.414
Are they buying it?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.296
Mrs. Voorhees...

02:51.463 --> 02:52.840
Oh, wait. You're divorced.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.049
What do I call you now?

02:54.133 --> 02:55.550
Mrs. Voor-hers?

02:55.717 --> 02:56.844
Ms. White.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.428
That's my Sioux family name.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.849
It was given to us in the 1920s
by a sarcastic census taker.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.101
Okay, Ms. White,

03:04.183 --> 03:05.978
what are you doing back in New York?

03:06.145 --> 03:08.647
Kimmy, I need your help.

03:08.814 --> 03:09.815
Help?

03:09.898 --> 03:11.900
That's what we elves are born to do.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.944
Oh, you <i>are </i> dressed like an elf.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.863
I just assumed it was the trucker pills.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.699
So what's the hardest thing in the world

03:18.866 --> 03:20.325
for a trophy wife to do?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.037
Lose the jerk but keep the perks.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.245
Trademark me.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.249
Julian's the jerk,
and the perks are everything

03:28.333 --> 03:30.836
I worked him so hard to achieve.

03:31.003 --> 03:34.339
And I'm gonna get it all back.

The first thing we have to do
is let the city know I'm back.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.249
I'll get my jumbo sidewalk chalk.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.211
Luckily, the gatekeepers
of New York society are all moms

04:12.293 --> 04:14.379
at St. Clotilde's School for Fancy Boys,

04:14.462 --> 04:15.630
where Buckley is kept.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.257
<i>They're thin, they're rich,</i>

04:18.341 --> 04:20.219
<i>and I'm their natural enemy...</i>

04:20.301 --> 04:21.511

04:26.558 --> 04:27.893
<i>the others will follow.</i>

04:27.976 --> 04:31.188
Reg is dragging me to the prewar auction
at J.O. Brothers tonight,

04:31.271 --> 04:32.981
and I am not doing that sober,

04:33.065 --> 04:35.150
so who's up for margaritas

04:35.234 --> 04:38.445
after Pilates Stella McCartney
vegan ankle boot bánh mì detox?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.281
Deirdre Robespierre.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.741
Owen R.'s mom?

04:42.824 --> 04:44.118
He's so cool!

04:44.284 --> 04:46.369
I have custody of Buckley this week.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.704
You go to after-school pickup

04:47.788 --> 04:49.748
and let the other nannies know I'm back.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.541
If anyone asks where I've been,

04:51.625 --> 04:53.585
just say the Côte d'Azur.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.839
Right, I forgot.

04:57.923 --> 04:58.966
Say I've been in Europe...

04:59.133 --> 05:00.550
traveling and trying to figure out

05:00.717 --> 05:02.928
how to spend my half of $3 billion.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.138
Got it?

05:04.221 --> 05:07.474
Okay, now I'm meeting a broker
to look at apartments.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.600
You know what to do...

05:10.018 --> 05:11.686
Heavenly Father!

05:11.853 --> 05:13.730
Titus, what happened?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.315
Much like Icarus,

05:15.398 --> 05:17.818
a friend of mine who once put
too much stuff in his closet,

05:17.901 --> 05:19.736
I put too much stuff in my closet.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.281
Oh, my gosh.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.053
Oh, Jacqueline's gonna be
staying with us for a few days.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.369
You two have met before, right?

05:28.536 --> 05:29.830
Doorman at Barney's.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.499
We buried a robot together.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.377
I can't believe "clo-zay" is gone.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.588
Well, do you really need
all these clothes?

05:38.755 --> 05:41.091
I mean, when's the last time you wore...

05:41.175 --> 05:42.425
red suspender shorts

05:42.509 --> 05:43.677
or puffy white gloves?

05:43.760 --> 05:44.761
Yes.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.321
Mickey-Mousing hasn't
been a thing in the community

05:46.345 --> 05:47.472
for quite some time.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.159
So why don't you get rid
of some of this stuff?

05:49.183 --> 05:52.311
Because each one of these pieces
is a little piece of me.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.229
Especially this pleather vest

05:54.313 --> 05:56.982
that melted onto me
after I fell asleep at a beach.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.275
Then give it to Goodwill.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.586
When I was a kid, that's where
I got my cool nurse shoes,

06:00.610 --> 06:02.445
and I was all, "Hi, I'm a nurse.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.823
After our shift,
let's go to the bar at the Ramada."

06:04.990 --> 06:06.310
The world would be a better place

06:06.365 --> 06:08.118
if everyone dressed more like me.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.578
Speaking of which, is that my elf costume?

06:11.538 --> 06:14.041
Oh, no, I left mine in that river.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.463
There's my ID.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.217
What the hell are you doing here?

06:23.382 --> 06:27.095
Being in a stupid-face contest
and coming in second.

06:27.262 --> 06:30.307
Well, I'm here cleaning my room out
to take stuff back to Connecticut.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.808
Connecticut!

06:31.892 --> 06:34.936
Do you know what my life is like now
because of you?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.105
I'm on a field hockey team.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.191
I scored twice against Country Day,

06:39.274 --> 06:40.525
and it's all your fault!

06:40.692 --> 06:42.236
Are you seriously still mad at me?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.072
I did it for your own good, Xan.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.865
Someday you'll thank me.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.492
Yeah, when pigs fly.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.702
Oh, my God.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.913
I sound so lame now!

06:53.080 --> 06:53.914
And stupid.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.041
Pigs fly all the time, Xan,

06:56.124 --> 06:57.334
or did you think prize pigs

06:57.416 --> 06:59.627
walk to international pig competitions?

07:06.843 --> 07:09.054
- This is not gonna be easy.
- I get it.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.391
After all these years,
I still haven't thrown away

07:12.473 --> 07:14.268
my late husband's clothes...

07:14.434 --> 07:16.436
and not just 'cause I dress up in them

07:16.519 --> 07:18.563
to cash his disability checks.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.399
I suppose I could part with this.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.901
It's irrelevant now that Drew Carey's
the host of the show.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.319
Yeah.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.904
And my bunion outgrew these

07:25.987 --> 07:28.615
limited-edition Air Jordache thigh-tops.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.492
Oh, and these shants.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.371
Oh, shorts that are as long as pants.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.622
Bye, shants.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.207
Good for you, Titus.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.917
Good for mankind, Lillian.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.169
Imagine a world where everyone shares

07:41.253 --> 07:43.130
my sense of fabulousness.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.756
There'd be no more war,

07:44.923 --> 07:46.674
no more famine,

07:46.758 --> 07:48.427
no more stupid polo shirts

07:48.509 --> 07:50.304
where the horse is, like, the whole shirt!

07:50.387 --> 07:52.347
Oh, yay!

07:52.513 --> 07:55.309
Go, Titus!

07:59.479 --> 08:00.521
Hey, guys.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.689
Remember me?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.401
I brought in those nut brownies
that almost killed a couple kids?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.445
Cool, cool.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.529
Owen R.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.702
You must be Owen's nanny. Whatevs.

08:15.787 --> 08:16.621
I love you.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.748
Oh, you're Kimmy,

08:18.832 --> 08:20.041
Buckley's nanny.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.042
You smell like summer.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.337
It's actually pre-fall, but you're sweet.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.089
So where has Jacqueline been?
We miss her.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.590
Traveling in Yerp.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.302
Euur-up.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.263
Well, please tell her
I would love to see her

08:33.347 --> 08:34.472
whenever she has time.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.140
She would like that.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.893
Oh, any chance she could do
a playdate today?

08:39.059 --> 08:40.812
Owen has blimping until 3:00.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.147
Would 3:30 work?

08:42.313 --> 08:43.398
Um...

08:43.482 --> 08:44.524
checking...

08:44.607 --> 08:46.360
calendar.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.987
Let me see.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.781
Aww...

08:51.865 --> 08:52.866
Hmm.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.451
Yes?

08:55.494 --> 08:56.870
Oh, then it's a date.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.289
Buckley playdate, 3:30.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.666
Owen playdate, 3:30.

09:01.749 --> 09:05.670
<i>I found the following on the web
for "urine playmate, teen dirty."</i>

09:05.753 --> 09:06.838
Siri, no!

09:11.968 --> 09:14.304
Now they filled in the sinkhole.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.056
Where am I supposed to number two

09:16.139 --> 09:18.141
when I have a gentleman caller?

09:25.524 --> 09:28.109
Pardon me, do you have
any more mannequins?

09:28.193 --> 09:30.070
My pieces will warrant a window display.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.239
Mannequins? No, we don't have...

09:32.322 --> 09:33.322
Hey!

09:33.407 --> 09:34.282
Sicko!

09:34.366 --> 09:35.367
Beat it!

09:39.371 --> 09:41.664
You got donations,
just throw 'em on the pile.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.590
All the better.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.433
My clothes will be plucked
from this hellhole

09:52.467 --> 09:54.719
like so many little orphans Annie.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.096
Exactly.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.682
Your clothes are special, like Annie.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.768
The rest of this stuff, it's ugly.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.811
No one wants it,

10:03.895 --> 10:05.063
like the other orphans,

10:05.146 --> 10:08.108
who eventually aged out of the system.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.997
I'm so proud.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.844
Well, my apartment search
has been a disaster.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.599
Everything is either
too expensive or just horrible.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.267
Look at this view.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.186
If I can see New Jersey,
that means it can see me.

10:45.353 --> 10:49.357
Okay, so at pickup,
I talked to Mrs. Robespierre...

10:49.524 --> 10:51.985
What? She was there?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.861
Her style... how effortless was it

10:53.945 --> 10:55.738
on a scale from none to zero?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.550
Look, after school, I dropped
Buckley off at Little League,

10:57.574 --> 10:59.009
even though he didn't have any equipment...

10:59.033 --> 11:00.076
Because he's an owner.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.412
He just watches the games
from his luxury tree.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.123
Okay, but later today,
he has a playdate

11:05.206 --> 11:07.125
with Owen and Owen's mom.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.043
Oh, Kimmy!

11:09.127 --> 11:10.920
I could just kiss you!

11:12.088 --> 11:13.714
But we shouldn't, right?

11:13.798 --> 11:14.882
Because...

11:17.676 --> 11:18.928
I should go get dressed.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.098
Maybe I've been overthinking this.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.058
I mean, I haven't been gone that long,

11:24.225 --> 11:26.394
and I am the best to be around.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.686
Listen to this laugh.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.276
More rosé?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.695
I am fun,

11:36.779 --> 11:38.990
and I absolutely underestimated Deirdre.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.367
What a sweetheart!

11:40.450 --> 11:42.160
She's so nice.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.662
She remembered my name,

11:43.744 --> 11:45.384
and she said since you've been traveling,

11:45.455 --> 11:46.581
she'll come to you.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.255
And where exactly

11:54.339 --> 11:56.299
do you expect her to go?

11:56.466 --> 11:57.300
Perhaps we should meet

11:57.384 --> 11:58.653
at the apartment that I don't have?

11:58.677 --> 12:01.555
Or did you expect her to come here?

12:01.638 --> 12:02.763
To this?

12:02.930 --> 12:05.433
I call it Kimmy's Klubhouse,
with two "K" s.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.688
That's why Deirdre
wanted to have a playdate,

12:09.770 --> 12:11.439
to see how I'm living now.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.286
Can't you just say we'll meet in the park?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.109
She'll see right through that.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.486
People don't go to the park

12:16.570 --> 12:19.072
when they have their own backyards
and terraces.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.326
Unless you have
something even better planned.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.580
Like visiting a place
where it's Christmas all year

12:26.663 --> 12:29.541
and you have to guess whether it's a man?

12:29.708 --> 12:31.543
It has to be something
that requires access,

12:31.626 --> 12:33.878
connections, special treatment.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.380
I went to a playdate once

12:35.463 --> 12:37.149
where the kids got to run
the Greek economy.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.174
We can beat that.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.718
What are nine-year-old boys into?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.844
Koosh balls. Pokémon.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.155
<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</i>

12:43.179 --> 12:45.557
Yes, the Mutant Ninja Turtles.
I can work with that.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.642
Really? That one's still a thing?

12:47.726 --> 12:49.018
- Why?
- Focus up, Kimmy.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.905
I need you to run back to the town house...

12:56.610 --> 12:57.694
Just practicing.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.237
I knew there was more plan.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.405
What's up?

13:00.572 --> 13:02.073
<i>♪ Heroes in a half shell ♪</i>

13:02.156 --> 13:03.324
<i>♪ Turtle power ♪</i>

13:03.408 --> 13:05.744
Whoever wrote that song
deserves to be a billionaire!

13:09.080 --> 13:10.123
Oh.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.586
What are you still doing here?

13:14.753 --> 13:16.254
Are you crying?

13:16.421 --> 13:19.132
No, this is the cool way
to do your makeup now.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.341
I know.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.635
I subscribe to <i>Teen Beat.</i>

13:21.800 --> 13:24.429
You're insane.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.935
Look, I know change is hard...

13:31.018 --> 13:32.061
Do you?

13:32.228 --> 13:34.606
This house has been
the only constant in my life.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.899
Every year, it's like,
"Here's your new mom,

13:36.983 --> 13:38.109
your new school,

13:38.192 --> 13:39.193
your new nose"...

13:39.277 --> 13:41.362
What? No. Shut up!

13:42.739 --> 13:45.492
I actually had to leave my home
when I was about your age.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.785
Yeah?

13:46.867 --> 13:49.329
Well, I bet you hate the person
who made you do it.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.497
Guess what, Kimmy.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.623
For me,

13:51.706 --> 13:52.957
that person's you.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.337
But that makes me the Reverend.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.797
I'm not the Reverend.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.849
Oh, Kimmy.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.059
Wonderful.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.020
Thank you.

14:14.103 --> 14:14.979
Thank you.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.063
Oh, Kimmy,

14:16.147 --> 14:18.775
I also need you to call my hotel.

14:18.857 --> 14:22.403
My suite is so big, I keep getting lost.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.572
Have them send up a guide monkey.

14:24.656 --> 14:25.865
Does Deirdre look impressed?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.408
Damn it, don't look.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.828
- Does she?
- I'm a good person, right?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.288
- Who cares?
- I know I'm not perfect.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.475
I sometimes look at magazine covers
without paying for them,

14:34.499 --> 14:36.042
and I've made some kissing mistakes...

14:36.125 --> 14:36.959
Hey.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.522
Making out with John Mayer
is just part of living in New York.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.507
But I also help you all the time,

14:42.590 --> 14:43.800
and I don't step on cracks,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.611
even though I haven't
seen my mother in years,

14:45.635 --> 14:47.887
and sending Xan to Connecticut
was for her own good.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.556
It doesn't make me the Reverend.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.408
I think it's time for some
Mutant Ninja Turtles

14:51.432 --> 14:52.975
to go an adventure!

14:53.059 --> 14:54.977
These costumes are just wonderful.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.372
The tortoise shells were collected

14:56.396 --> 14:59.399
by Buckley's grandfather
during a hunting trip to the Galápagos.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.692
Oh.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.152
We need to get through this, Schmidt.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.779
You're not the Reverend, okay?

15:04.863 --> 15:07.423
Now get these kids underground,
and don't let the police see you.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.116
All right, Turtles!

15:09.200 --> 15:11.160
Let's go to your secret hideout
in the sewer!

15:11.244 --> 15:12.620
Yeah!

15:15.874 --> 15:17.208
Okay, come on.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.252
- Be safe.
- Bye.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.798
She should not be able to do that.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.177
Look, a rat!

15:28.261 --> 15:30.012
- Is it Master Splinter?
- Mm-hmm.

15:30.096 --> 15:30.971
Oh, yeah!

15:31.055 --> 15:32.056
There's hundreds of them.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.558
Ugh.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.810
So how's the apartment hunt?

15:36.853 --> 15:39.105
Everything's too affordable.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.399
I really like that new building
that Rem Koolhaas

15:41.482 --> 15:42.776
and Michael Stipe designed.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.152
The Rem Koolhaas R.E.M. Cool House?

15:46.362 --> 15:47.196
Hmm?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.452
Oh, a Birkin bag.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.888
It's the one that's made entirely

15:53.912 --> 15:55.663
out of famous Internet cats.

15:55.830 --> 15:56.915
Oh, no, no, I know.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.499
It's just, those came out last year.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.335
This is exactly why I love you,
Jacqueline.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.921
You don't care what anybody thinks.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.924
Oh, Deirdre.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.217
I never can tell
if you're trying to help me

16:08.301 --> 16:10.052
or destroy me!

16:11.262 --> 16:12.555
I honestly don't know!

16:13.765 --> 16:16.267
I have a degree in political science
from Princeton,

16:16.350 --> 16:19.103
and all that wasted mental energy
has to go somewhere.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.864
I'll be in intimates.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.454
Is this some sort of joke?

16:36.621 --> 16:39.373
Is this sticker a phone call
from <i>Crank Yankers?</i>

16:39.457 --> 16:40.541
Is it?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.508
The culottes can also be used
as pants for stuffed animals.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.613
Hey, Titus,

17:10.780 --> 17:12.781
you got a D battery on you?

17:12.949 --> 17:17.662
I want to whip a Philadelphia snowball
at those hipsters.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.747
Millennials.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.040
They'll appreciate me.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.916
Millennia, this is perfect.

17:24.084 --> 17:27.213
For our sketch show about ladies
who work at Jennifer Convertibles!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.464
Unacceptable!

17:28.631 --> 17:30.216
You people don't know the meaning

17:30.299 --> 17:32.635
of the word "sensuali-Titus-travaganza!"

17:33.594 --> 17:35.221
That's it!

17:36.848 --> 17:38.307
Donation canceled!

17:38.391 --> 17:40.142
Pearls before swine!

17:40.226 --> 17:41.519
I should have known better.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.437
You people don't deserve Titus!

17:46.065 --> 17:48.526
And I was wearing this when I came in.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.612
Hey!

17:51.779 --> 17:53.656
Buddy, get out of here!

17:58.327 --> 18:00.830
This is why I never
open myself up to the world.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.641
I just get rejected
like a crinkly dollar bill

18:02.665 --> 18:03.750
in a vending machine!

18:03.833 --> 18:05.084
Titus, no.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.502
You're very smooth.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.128
You're like a pudding man.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.797
Good-bye, cruel world!

18:11.674 --> 18:15.302
I wish Bruce Willis
had let that asteroid hit you!

18:15.386 --> 18:17.137
Hashtag spoiler alert!

18:21.809 --> 18:24.645
We killed Bebop the pig man
and ate so much pizza!

18:28.691 --> 18:30.818
Well, this was so much fun.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.421
I would say, "See you tonight,"
but lucky for you,

18:32.445 --> 18:34.655
you don't have a husband.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.908
I just mean you don't have
a husband who drags you

18:36.991 --> 18:38.534
to auctions every other night.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.578
You know Reg and his art.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.472
He and his sister have
the world's largest collection

18:42.496 --> 18:43.957
of Greek incest pottery.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.809
Well, let me come with you.
I'll keep you company.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.710
Oh, that's so sweet,

18:47.794 --> 18:49.963
but it's just no fun when you can't bid.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.090
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.175
Darling, can I tell you something?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.469
As a friend?

18:56.636 --> 18:57.720
I don't know. Can you?

18:57.887 --> 19:00.347
I'm honestly not sure.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.850
I have a 150 IQ, but I spent all morning

19:02.934 --> 19:04.435
picking out dog stationery.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.396
Maybe I'm just tormenting you
just to feel alive,

19:07.480 --> 19:11.358
but also there is a chance
this is real empathy.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.402
We may never know!

19:13.569 --> 19:15.780
Okay, friend, what is it?

19:15.863 --> 19:18.282
Some hateful rumor about my divorce?

19:18.449 --> 19:21.452
Oh, you are not as dumb
as I say people say you are.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.121
Look,

19:23.287 --> 19:24.998
I hate to dignify this,

19:25.081 --> 19:26.666
but there is a rumor

19:26.749 --> 19:28.709
that you only got $12 million from Julian.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.419
Wow.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.421
That is absurd.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.299
I've never had 12 of anything.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.844
$12 million.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.596
I mean, would a dozenaire
have a chauffeured Bentley?

19:40.680 --> 19:41.764
I don't think so.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.393
Get in the car, kids.
Let's get in the car.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.649
See you tonight, sweetie.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.362
Excuse me.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.996
Stay down.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.288
Get to that bus.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.581
What's a bus?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.458
I can't keep this up.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.884
Titus!

20:17.967 --> 20:19.635
Titus, you'll never believe it!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.345
Go away, Lillian.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.848
I've decided to live as a bed from now on.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.017
But your clothes are gone!

20:26.100 --> 20:27.560
Somebody took 'em!

20:27.643 --> 20:28.769
- They did?
- Yeah!

20:28.853 --> 20:30.646
Oh, that's... Wait a minute.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.690
Oh, Titus,

20:32.857 --> 20:35.818
you are not on <i>Crank Yankers.</i>

20:35.902 --> 20:38.278
It's not a show anymore,

20:38.362 --> 20:39.906
and they would call you.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.745
I just wish we could have met
the chic sophisticate

20:45.828 --> 20:47.139
that was rummaging through a Dumpster

20:47.163 --> 20:48.539
on a hot weekday afternoon.

20:48.706 --> 20:52.334
I'm just happy
there's another Titus out there.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.670
It's too bad we'll never know who he is.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.314
He could have been
my stunt double if I were ever

20:56.338 --> 20:58.632
to get cast in a movie
that involves stairs.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.384
Well, I'll see you back at the house.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.428
I found some unshredded mail in there,

21:02.595 --> 21:05.014
so I'm gonna go open up a Kohl's card.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.444
One of my Mickey-Mousing gloves.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.946
Other Titus must have dropped it.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.748
Teddy von Bearington's pants
and/or my culottes.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.342
My shants!

21:42.426 --> 21:43.594
Can I help you, pal?

21:44.386 --> 21:45.471
So sorry.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.224
It's just that I threw away
some clothes earlier,

21:48.307 --> 21:49.576
and then I Hansel-and-Gretel'd myself

21:49.600 --> 21:53.520
to your backless... car... thingy.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.439
Hang on.

21:55.522 --> 21:56.607
I know you.

21:56.774 --> 21:57.942
I don't think so.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.110
I am an enigma.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.736
No, dude, you're the...

22:00.820 --> 22:03.405
you're the first guy I ever hit on.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.825
I'm Mikey?

22:07.201 --> 22:09.620
I came out to you.

22:09.787 --> 22:10.913
Of course.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.331
I remember your wrists.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.167
Titus Andromedon.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.130
You may know me
from my attendance at such films

22:16.210 --> 22:17.503
as <i>Must Love Dogs</i>

22:17.586 --> 22:19.713
and the first 20 minutes of <i>Interstellar.</i>

22:19.797 --> 22:21.632
Anyway, you dropped these.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.217
Sorry.

22:23.301 --> 22:26.887
I'm not exactly <i>out </i> out at work, you know?

22:26.971 --> 22:28.514
I got to put up a front.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.599
Go to the strip club with the guys,

22:30.683 --> 22:33.227
airbrush a hot chick
on the back of my truck.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.272
Oh...

22:36.354 --> 22:38.065
I get it.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.734
Putting yourself out there is scary.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.028
Right?

22:42.111 --> 22:44.864
And with the gay stuff,
I don't know where to start.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.158
Sometimes I snazz things up
at work, like...

22:47.241 --> 22:48.534
like with this shirt,

22:48.617 --> 22:49.970
but then the guys start razzing me, like,

22:49.994 --> 22:51.495
"How's it going, Mr. Shirt?"

22:51.662 --> 22:53.080
That kind of thing.

22:53.247 --> 22:56.625
But when I saw your clothes
in the Dumpster, I just...

22:56.709 --> 22:58.187
just thought they were real beautiful.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.714
Thank you.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.590
That's...

23:03.674 --> 23:04.842
Thank you.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.095
Well, goodbye forever.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.722
Titus, wait.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.325
Don't you think it's... I don't know...

23:11.349 --> 23:12.683
a sign,

23:12.766 --> 23:15.311
running into each other like this?

23:15.393 --> 23:17.355
Do we believe in signs, us homos?

23:17.437 --> 23:18.856
I can say that, right?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.774
It's America.
You can say anything except...

23:29.783 --> 23:30.868
...Jezebel.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.453
Right, well, look,

23:33.537 --> 23:34.872
you already rejected me once,

23:34.955 --> 23:38.334
but you remind me of Carlos Delgado
from the Mets,

23:38.416 --> 23:39.877
and that's just hot,

23:39.960 --> 23:41.921
and, uh, whatever.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.881
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.008
- Right?
- Mathematically, no.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.676
But I do know what you're saying.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.969
Okay.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.804
So...

23:55.976 --> 23:57.144
You want to go out sometime?

23:57.311 --> 23:59.021
Oh.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.085
Yeah!

24:26.590 --> 24:27.817
This isn't gonna work.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.093
I can't do it,

24:29.260 --> 24:30.468
and I'm not a quitter, Kimmy.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.972
I watched <i>Interstellar</i>
all the way to the end.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.598
<i>You </i> can't keep doing this?

24:34.765 --> 24:36.183
Yes, me.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.060
Is there anyone else here?

24:38.227 --> 24:39.812
I try to be a good person,

24:39.895 --> 24:41.105
but I don't feel good at all,

24:41.188 --> 24:42.815
and it's not just the sewer pizza.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.024
Xan hates me,

24:44.108 --> 24:45.234
Owen got a rat bite,

24:45.318 --> 24:46.598
and all you're doing is lying...

24:46.735 --> 24:47.945
about how much money you have,

24:48.112 --> 24:50.281
where you live, what monkeys do at hotels.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.449
And how come?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.491
So you can go back
to your dumb life you hated?

24:53.575 --> 24:54.660
What's the point?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.703
I don't know about Xan.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.705
Did you see her?
Did she get fat in Connecticut?

24:58.872 --> 25:02.376
But you're helping me
do something really important and good.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.378
'Splain it.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.713
I came back to New York to help my family.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.633
By turning into a Deirdre
and making me fight a gutter pig?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.510
The Dutch bought Manhattan
for $24 worth of beads.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.221
Today it's worth a trillion,

25:14.305 --> 25:16.223
and I plan to make up the difference.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.476
But who even has that much beads?

25:18.558 --> 25:19.744
Maybe Michael's Arts &amp; Crafts.

25:19.768 --> 25:20.853
Ask for Jan!

25:21.020 --> 25:23.022
Every year, men like Deirdre's husband

25:23.105 --> 25:24.940
donate billions to charity.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.235
They support art museums,
wiener disease research,

25:28.319 --> 25:31.405
super PACs that drive poor people
to the circus on election day.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.366
And you get free peanuts.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.659
You know who Robin Hood is?

25:35.826 --> 25:37.286
Uh, yeah.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.080
That Disney movie
where Robin Hood's a fox?

25:40.164 --> 25:42.291
When you were little,
did you think he was handsome?

25:42.375 --> 25:44.835
And then, like,
your crotch gets a headache?

25:45.002 --> 25:45.836
Are you kidding?

25:45.919 --> 25:47.046
That voice

25:47.129 --> 25:48.381
and how he didn't wear pants?

25:50.007 --> 25:51.549
Well, I'm trying to be Robin Hood.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.178
Take from the rich and give to the poor.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.554
If I can get back into Deirdre's world,

25:56.638 --> 26:00.100
I can start a charity
that will make up for 400 years

26:00.184 --> 26:01.227
of Dutch oppression,

26:01.310 --> 26:04.771
but I won't get a penny
unless I'm taken seriously,

26:04.938 --> 26:07.858
and if I fail, I can't go back home.

26:10.528 --> 26:14.073
You know, in the bunker,
when a new girl showed up,

26:14.240 --> 26:17.451
there was one way she could get
instant respect.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.828
Go up to the toughest-looking girl there

26:19.912 --> 26:21.579
and punch her in the face.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.208
What does the Reverend even see in her?

26:24.375 --> 26:25.876
It's like, talk American, right?

26:29.213 --> 26:31.589
Now you're all my bitches!

26:31.757 --> 26:33.175
Mm!

26:36.429 --> 26:37.513
Who the heck are you?

26:37.679 --> 26:39.681
I'm Gretchen. I just got here.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.641
<i>After that,</i>

26:41.808 --> 26:42.935
no one messes with you.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.730
I don't know what the rich blonde lady
version of a bunker punch is...

26:46.897 --> 26:48.023
I do.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.907
Kimmy, I need you to go back
to the town house

26:49.983 --> 26:52.236
and get Julian's father's
slave auction paddle.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.363
Father? That's not long enough ago.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.241
And, look, I know I've been making you
run back and forth all day,

26:57.408 --> 26:59.285
but I can't go back to that house.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.660
Too many terrible memories.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.329
That's it!

27:02.496 --> 27:03.914
That's how I help Xan!

27:04.081 --> 27:06.708
Did you hear? She got fat in Connecticut.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.257
You must have a lot of great
memories in this house.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.508
I don't get it.

27:14.674 --> 27:17.261
I was putting Windex in your food,
like, every day.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.013
I bet each room in this house
is special to you.

27:20.097 --> 27:22.015
Obviously this one is.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.142
It's funny,

27:23.225 --> 27:25.036
'cause this is also
where your tutor Charles and I

27:25.060 --> 27:26.479
would tongue out in secret.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.314
Wait. What?

27:28.397 --> 27:29.398
Oh, yeah.

27:29.482 --> 27:30.608
We'd be all...

27:33.693 --> 27:35.695
Oh, yeah! Gimme!

27:37.030 --> 27:38.365
Oh, yeah!

27:40.075 --> 27:42.702
Wh... Why are <i>you</i> doing that?

27:42.869 --> 27:44.455
Ew!

27:44.622 --> 27:47.333
You must have a lot
of great memories in here.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.917
Breakfast on Christmas morning,

27:49.001 --> 27:50.252
hanging out with your friends,

27:50.336 --> 27:51.669
to say nothing of lunch!

27:51.837 --> 27:53.380
I did a lot of stuff here, too.

27:53.464 --> 27:54.507
For example...

27:54.672 --> 27:58.051
<i>playing "Sexy Cat Burglar
Avoiding Lasers."</i>

28:01.347 --> 28:03.890
<i>Rapping my cool Kimmy raps.</i>

28:04.057 --> 28:05.142
<i>♪ Xan's got a plan ♪</i>

28:05.225 --> 28:07.269
<i>♪ With her friend Jan
in the tan van, man ♪</i>

28:07.353 --> 28:08.521
<i>♪ Aww, beatbox ♪</i>

28:10.814 --> 28:12.232
And look,

28:12.316 --> 28:14.901
a world of infinite Kimmys.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.195
Please stop!

28:18.572 --> 28:20.574
Any good memories out here?

28:20.658 --> 28:21.992
No.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.202
Cool,

28:23.285 --> 28:26.580
'cause this is where I threw up
baked beans and sewer pizza.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.748
You what? When?

28:28.832 --> 28:31.043
Right now!

28:32.127 --> 28:33.837
Damn it, Kimmy,

28:33.920 --> 28:35.631
that's where I had my first kiss.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.883
You're like an HGTV renovation team.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.594
You come into someone's home
and ruin it with your stupidity.

28:40.678 --> 28:43.222
You ruined the house I grew up in.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.932
I bet that makes it easier to leave.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.810
Do you think you're helping me?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.479
You're heading for the door.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.400
You're so weird.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.193
In bed!

29:04.117 --> 29:06.203
Going once, going twice...

29:06.286 --> 29:07.663
What are you doing?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.956
Using my $12 million to punch Deirdre

29:10.040 --> 29:11.458
in her white mouth.

29:11.625 --> 29:15.421
Sold to the lady in the front row
for $111/2 million.

29:18.632 --> 29:19.966
I'm so sorry.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.720
I didn't recognize you, Mrs. Voorhee...

29:22.886 --> 29:24.846
I mean Ms. White.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.941
She must have taken Julian
for all he's worth,

29:36.024 --> 29:37.943
and now she's returned in full,

29:38.026 --> 29:40.153
like Alcibiades to Athens,

29:40.237 --> 29:42.322
and I have become her Eupolis.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.951
Oh, I picked up Mookie's stationery.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.576
- Good night, everybody!
- Good night!
