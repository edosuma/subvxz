[Emaramus]
<i>Beneath the arms of your chairs,</i>

00:13.870 --> 00:16.506
if you haven't already noticed,
are two buttons.

00:16.907 --> 00:18.809
[Emaramus]
Your left, to vote for freedom,

00:19.843 --> 00:21.379
under your right arm

00:22.111 --> 00:23.613
is a vote for death.

00:28.718 --> 00:31.421
[eerie music playing]

00:32.723 --> 00:36.561
[priest] The Lord is
my shepherd; I shall not want.

00:37.126 --> 00:38.862
He makes me to lie down...

00:43.733 --> 00:45.635
[priest] He restores my soul:

00:45.669 --> 00:50.608
He leads me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

00:50.641 --> 00:52.043
Even though I walk

00:52.075 --> 00:54.578
- through the valley of the shadow of death...
- [car doors closing]

00:57.681 --> 01:01.651
I will fear no evil,
for You are with me;

01:01.684 --> 01:05.489
Your rod and Your staff
they comfort me.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.758
You prepared a table
before me...

01:07.790 --> 01:11.594
[tense music building up]

01:11.627 --> 01:16.400
[priest mumbling]

01:18.701 --> 01:22.773
...and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

01:27.611 --> 01:28.546
Daddy?

01:28.912 --> 01:31.481
Come here. Don't stand up, okay?

01:34.550 --> 01:35.820
[rapid beeping]

01:35.853 --> 01:36.754
I'm here, mother.

01:36.787 --> 01:37.888
- [beeping]
- [shooting]

01:37.921 --> 01:40.124
[agent]
Sniper! Get 'em out of here!

01:40.156 --> 01:42.593
- [agent] Get 'em out of here!
- [agent] Move! Move! Move!

01:42.626 --> 01:43.928
[agent] Get back in the car!

01:43.960 --> 01:46.630
[agent] Take the south side
of the street.

01:47.630 --> 01:48.731
What happened?

01:48.766 --> 01:50.835
[woman] You don't want to know.
Just get us out of here.

01:50.868 --> 01:52.503
[agent] Anybody got eye?

01:52.535 --> 01:53.603
Over here!

01:54.805 --> 01:57.708
[beeping]

02:09.652 --> 02:11.155
[window opening]

02:15.225 --> 02:17.794
I'm here to seek forgiveness
for my sins, Father.

02:19.630 --> 02:23.834
[priest] But your sins are
far too harsh for forgiveness.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.268
What?

02:25.302 --> 02:30.673
- [priest chuckling]
- [gas entering room]

02:30.707 --> 02:32.108
[coughing]

02:32.142 --> 02:36.481
[rock music playing]

02:45.322 --> 02:48.493
- [man] This is top of the line, premium stuff.
- Okay. Okay.

02:53.230 --> 02:54.599
- [shooting]
- Ah!

02:58.768 --> 02:59.769
[shooting]

03:06.709 --> 03:07.911
Double dealing.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.549
You can have it.

03:12.583 --> 03:13.651
All of it.

03:27.597 --> 03:31.736
[rock music playing]

03:34.637 --> 03:38.808
I called him that evening,
and we made plans to meet.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.178
Had you seen or met him
somewhere before?

03:44.982 --> 03:46.984
I never know them, Doctor.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.155
[gasping for air]

03:53.290 --> 03:56.827
Well, it's our time for today.
Same time next week?

03:58.629 --> 03:59.697
[elevator bell ringing]

04:09.272 --> 04:10.674
[rattling]

04:12.809 --> 04:14.311
Come on.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.149
[buzzing]

04:19.182 --> 04:20.351
[elevator bell ringing]

04:25.322 --> 04:29.692
[rock music playing]

04:29.726 --> 04:34.163
[woman whining]

04:34.197 --> 04:36.733
[gasping for air]

04:36.767 --> 04:39.269
[coughing]

04:43.173 --> 04:44.908
[Nadia] <i>Lucy, tell me something.</i>

04:44.940 --> 04:48.845
[Nadia] Why is it that every
time I set you up with a client,

04:48.878 --> 04:51.181
I never hear
back from them?

04:51.848 --> 04:54.151
Look, if you don't want
to work with me...

04:54.183 --> 04:57.320
No, darling, please, stay.

04:59.455 --> 05:01.191
Do business as usual.

05:09.832 --> 05:12.669
- [Lucy] Who the fuck are...
- [buzzing]

05:21.243 --> 05:25.381
[rock music playing]

05:25.414 --> 05:28.418
[people chattering]

05:40.464 --> 05:42.199
I think I'm gonna take off.

05:42.798 --> 05:44.935
Alright. Well, catch
you tomorrow.

05:44.967 --> 05:45.935
Yeah.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.997
[whimpering]

06:21.303 --> 06:25.842
[rock music playing]

06:27.444 --> 06:29.413
[Curtis] What's going on?
I can't see a thing.

06:30.279 --> 06:31.781
[Lucy] Oh, fuck.

06:32.349 --> 06:33.382
[Lucy sighing]

06:33.416 --> 06:35.286
[Romero]
Moving only makes it worse.

06:36.185 --> 06:37.353
[Curtis] Who said that?

06:38.988 --> 06:40.356
[coughing]

06:41.291 --> 06:43.226
- [Marlene] Doesn't matter.
- [switch flipping]

06:44.194 --> 06:45.329
Oh.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.429
[liquid dripping]

06:46.462 --> 06:47.897
God.

06:47.930 --> 06:49.500
[switch flipping]

06:49.533 --> 06:50.735
Oh.

06:54.303 --> 06:55.272
[switch flipping]

07:00.476 --> 07:02.979
- Fuck.
- [switches flipping]

07:05.348 --> 07:07.885
I guess this is the part
we get to meet our host.

07:07.918 --> 07:10.387
[walking steps resounding]

07:17.293 --> 07:18.928
Ladies, gentlemen,

07:20.462 --> 07:21.464
killers alike.

07:21.498 --> 07:22.565
Killers?

07:22.599 --> 07:23.666
What are you talking about?

07:23.700 --> 07:26.502
That <i>puta</i> Madam Nadia sent you,
didn't she?

07:26.536 --> 07:28.405
I know it was fucking her.

07:29.339 --> 07:31.841
If it is the smugglers
you work for,

07:31.875 --> 07:34.178
I and my associates can pay
you more.

07:34.211 --> 07:35.012
Oh.

07:35.878 --> 07:38.447
Such energy and bravado

07:38.481 --> 07:40.451
from those who deal in death.

07:41.418 --> 07:42.386
Hmm.

07:43.486 --> 07:47.957
Allow me to apologize
for the lack of lavatories.

07:48.457 --> 07:50.928
Your actions
will not be frowned upon.

07:50.961 --> 07:54.231
I have also provided water,
as you see,

07:55.365 --> 07:57.234
if I find you deserving.

07:58.034 --> 07:59.837
[Romero]
Who the fuck are you kidding?

08:00.337 --> 08:02.839
I'm lying here,
in my own piss and shit.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.909
You're roasting us with these electric
heaters every hour on the hour

08:05.942 --> 08:08.212
and now what,
you're gonna offer us water?

08:08.245 --> 08:11.915
Where the fuck did you learn your
manners, you fucking cocksucker, you?

08:11.947 --> 08:14.317
I'll... I'll have some water,
if you don't mind.

08:14.351 --> 08:15.820
Seriously?

08:16.452 --> 08:19.923
You've been here what,
all of fucking five minutes?

08:19.955 --> 08:22.458
Who are you? What do you want?

08:22.491 --> 08:23.960
I'm Emaramus.

08:24.894 --> 08:26.329
Emaramus Kloath.

08:27.430 --> 08:28.498
Hi.

08:28.531 --> 08:33.236
[rock music playing]

08:35.405 --> 08:36.440
[chuckles]

08:36.472 --> 08:38.876
But I think it's the latter,

08:38.908 --> 08:42.846
far more pertinent to you,
Mr. Fofana.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.283
Your killing spanned
three continents.

08:47.983 --> 08:49.219
Very impressive.

08:50.420 --> 08:52.488
And Mistress Lucy.

08:54.391 --> 08:58.228
Black widow of rich sadists.

08:58.929 --> 09:02.565
And Romero, Mr. Scaranelli,

09:02.599 --> 09:06.570
hit man extraordinaire,
real tough guy.

09:08.604 --> 09:10.574
[Emaramus]
And of course, let's not forget

09:11.574 --> 09:15.646
the sweet but not so innocent
Mrs. Gunthery.

09:17.247 --> 09:18.482
[whimpering]

09:18.515 --> 09:21.418
Not so talented
as you're brushing death, dear.

09:21.984 --> 09:24.454
It's a shame the world
doesn't recognize it.

09:24.487 --> 09:27.257
- Leave her the fuck alone, you piece of shit!
- [chuckling]

09:28.959 --> 09:30.560
[Emaramus] And last,

09:31.427 --> 09:35.365
we have
Professor Curtis Tiddleman.

09:36.232 --> 09:38.502
You know, it's only by chance
you came to join us.

09:39.435 --> 09:43.272
I was merely enjoying
my evening's drink

09:43.305 --> 09:46.310
when I saw you stalking
that pretty blonde girl.

09:46.343 --> 09:47.544
No.

09:47.578 --> 09:51.982
I've never seen such subtle
malevolence in someone's eyes.

09:52.648 --> 09:57.287
[Emaramus] And I have been around
some very nasty characters in my day.

09:57.653 --> 10:02.525
Only the devil knows what you
would've done to that poor woman.

10:03.258 --> 10:05.662
So, all these people
are killers?

10:06.563 --> 10:11.936
[walking steps resounding]

10:13.603 --> 10:18.007
Yes, killers, just like you,
Mr. Tiddleman.

10:19.743 --> 10:24.281
Killers who will not
only decide your fate,

10:24.314 --> 10:26.717
but the fate
of one another as well.

10:27.783 --> 10:29.319
I'm not a killer.

10:32.388 --> 10:35.424
[country music playing]

10:35.458 --> 10:38.462
It's like going to a nightclub,
and you can't get in,

10:38.494 --> 10:41.230
and you don't know the bouncer,
and you're not dressed right,

10:41.263 --> 10:43.433
and you don't have enough money
to grease the bouncer.

10:44.066 --> 10:46.570
And this is why privilege

10:46.603 --> 10:50.507
is a primary barrier

10:51.440 --> 10:52.976
to social mobility.

10:53.776 --> 10:54.645
Yes?

10:56.278 --> 10:57.981
What about the American Dream?

10:59.516 --> 11:02.219
I mean, if you're smart

11:02.252 --> 11:05.388
and you work hard,
you can have it all?

11:06.455 --> 11:10.393
All right, let's talk about that,
because I've heard that, too.

11:13.729 --> 11:16.767
What are you shooting from behind the
arc, mid to high 30s?

11:16.800 --> 11:20.237
What? Come on, Mr. T.

11:20.270 --> 11:22.239
Try 41.8.

11:22.272 --> 11:23.607
[everyone] Ooh!

11:23.640 --> 11:26.443
Okay, all right.
So you're a natural athlete,

11:26.475 --> 11:29.211
and on top of that,
you work really hard.

11:29.244 --> 11:30.346
Definitely.

11:30.379 --> 11:32.615
Since I was like six or seven.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.683
All right, there you have it.

11:34.717 --> 11:36.252
Okay.

11:36.286 --> 11:38.387
So this is gonna be like
another day at the gym for you.

11:38.421 --> 11:42.258
I would like everyone here
to take out a piece of paper

11:43.358 --> 11:47.464
and write your name on it and
crumble it up into a little ball,

11:48.297 --> 11:51.567
and I am going to take
this awesome hat here.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.502
I'm gonna hold it out.

11:53.536 --> 11:57.541
And if you can throw the piece
of paper into the hat,

11:58.407 --> 11:59.743
sitting where you are,

12:00.542 --> 12:03.647
I will give you an A
on tomorrow's quiz.

12:04.814 --> 12:05.815
Let's play ball.

12:13.355 --> 12:15.624
[Curtis]
We're waiting for you, Mr. 41.8.

12:15.657 --> 12:17.527
Yeah, I know, I know.

12:17.860 --> 12:21.531
I just don't want nobody
interfering with perfection.

12:31.874 --> 12:33.309
Damn it.

12:33.343 --> 12:34.645
[Curtis] Close, but no cigar.

12:34.677 --> 12:38.581
So that was a lesson in social
mobility and privilege, right?

12:39.449 --> 12:40.818
Because the front row,

12:41.884 --> 12:43.352
they're the privileged,

12:44.454 --> 12:46.290
but also the minority.

12:47.858 --> 12:51.661
And the socioeconomic construct of
society means the farther away you are,

12:52.362 --> 12:57.668
the less likely it is that you are
going to achieve the American Dream.

12:58.501 --> 13:01.472
Even Mr. 41.8,

13:01.838 --> 13:04.574
with all of his natural talents

13:04.607 --> 13:07.411
and all of his years
of hard work,

13:08.777 --> 13:10.279
he came up short.

13:11.446 --> 13:13.282
He represents the majority.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.719
So what I...
I'd like the front row to do,

13:17.520 --> 13:18.621
the privileged,

13:18.655 --> 13:22.493
is to turn around and look
at the people behind you.

13:23.792 --> 13:26.395
And my message
to those of you today

13:26.429 --> 13:31.434
who are fortunate enough to be
positioned in life to obtain privilege,

13:31.467 --> 13:35.739
be it by fortune or by birth,

13:36.839 --> 13:42.679
is to never forget the people
positioned behind you

13:44.479 --> 13:47.850
because then your fortune

13:49.685 --> 13:52.388
becomes our misfortune.

13:52.421 --> 13:54.356
[school bell ringing]

13:54.390 --> 13:55.559
See you tomorrow.

13:57.392 --> 13:58.695
Valid point, Mr. T.

13:58.728 --> 14:00.363
Thanks, Jamal.

14:06.569 --> 14:07.471
Wow.

14:09.405 --> 14:12.675
You really know how to capture the
hearts and minds of your students.

14:13.743 --> 14:14.710
Thank you.

14:15.677 --> 14:18.347
I'm Christine Jennings,
English Department.

14:19.382 --> 14:21.685
Uh, nice to meet you.

14:22.618 --> 14:23.887
[Curtis] I'm late for...

14:25.354 --> 14:26.455
Okay.

14:30.892 --> 14:33.629
And you think because you saw me

14:33.662 --> 14:36.365
try to work up the nerve
to ask a co-worker out

14:36.398 --> 14:37.566
that I'm a killer too?

14:39.368 --> 14:42.572
[Curtis] Do you realize how
ridiculously insane that sounds?

14:43.373 --> 14:44.874
You're crazy.

14:46.575 --> 14:48.744
[Curtis crying] I've never
harmed anyone in my life.

14:50.847 --> 14:54.685
Well, that's not
for me to decide.

14:56.286 --> 15:00.790
It's this time, I do have
my reserved judgment, of course.

15:00.823 --> 15:04.728
And I will exercise it
if your peers choose not to...

15:05.560 --> 15:06.629
[Romero] Peers?

15:06.662 --> 15:07.763
Mm-hm.

15:07.797 --> 15:09.899
What are you gonna do,
you're gonna call the police?

15:10.767 --> 15:11.834
It's true?

15:12.801 --> 15:14.803
You're really all killers?

15:14.836 --> 15:15.838
Yes.

15:16.605 --> 15:19.308
Killers, just like you.

15:19.342 --> 15:20.710
- No.
- [Emaramus] Mr. Tiddleman.

15:20.743 --> 15:22.811
- No.
- [Emaramus] Killers who will...

15:22.844 --> 15:26.682
- No.
- ...all vote on your fate and the fate of each other.

15:27.450 --> 15:28.785
Who are you to label us?

15:30.786 --> 15:34.358
You know nothing about us.
You know nothing about me.

15:48.438 --> 15:49.406
[knocking]

15:49.646 --> 15:51.792
[foreign language]
Can I come in?

15:52.708 --> 15:54.167
All right-

15:54.208 --> 15:57.750
Tell me, why aren't you playing outside
with the other kids?

15:57.792 --> 16:00.875
I don't know any of them, I'm scared.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.083
What are you scared of?

16:03.500 --> 16:06.083
That the kids won't play with me.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.917
You don't know that.

16:08.333 --> 16:11.042
Look babe, see this ring?

16:11.625 --> 16:13.625
This is a halo.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.208
Like an angel?

16:15.250 --> 16:16.875
Yes, exactly.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.750
And you now what?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.667
Because you're going be an angel that's

16:22.708 --> 16:25.792
going to fly through her adventures without
fear of anything

16:26.500 --> 16:29.542
And you know everyone loves angels.

16:30.417 --> 16:31.917
Okay, ready?

16:34.625 --> 16:36.125
Come on.

16:36.270 --> 16:39.722
Oh, I know what you know
and don't know.

16:40.589 --> 16:42.691
And I know you
better than you know yourself.

16:42.724 --> 16:43.625
Wait.

16:44.727 --> 16:47.464
What do you mean decide
one another's fate?

16:47.497 --> 16:50.934
Oh, Ms. Gunthery,
so good of you to join in.

16:51.666 --> 16:54.603
Well, one by one,

16:56.906 --> 16:59.709
each of you is going
to give an account

16:59.742 --> 17:04.914
of what led you to embark
on the life of a killer.

17:06.181 --> 17:10.085
And after the accounts
have all been weighed,

17:10.118 --> 17:11.421
we shall vote.

17:11.453 --> 17:12.855
[Romero]
You gotta be kidding me.

17:12.888 --> 17:15.692
You are one sick motherfucker,
you know that?

17:21.763 --> 17:23.565
[grunting]

17:23.598 --> 17:24.933
Dom, Tony, come on.

17:24.967 --> 17:28.505
Sometimes I wonder if this what
being a man with two kids is like.

17:28.537 --> 17:31.775
[cars honking]

17:33.476 --> 17:34.444
Hey, buddy.

17:34.477 --> 17:36.747
It's buy and read,
not the other way around.

17:45.220 --> 17:46.690
You keep the change.

17:48.190 --> 17:50.427
Retirement
might be just around the corner.

17:54.831 --> 17:56.733
You'd better hope I don't
get out of here.

17:59.869 --> 18:02.873
Example, Ms. Gunthery.

18:03.706 --> 18:05.142
Yay or nay?

18:05.674 --> 18:07.176
Does she get to live,

18:07.910 --> 18:12.449
or is she punished by death
for her acts?

18:14.150 --> 18:17.853
[Emaramus] You will, of course,
get to vote on your own fate,

18:17.886 --> 18:22.458
as with the rest of you,
in the true spirit of democracy.

18:22.491 --> 18:24.693
Death doesn't frighten me.

18:25.628 --> 18:27.230
[crying]
Frightens the hell out of me.

18:27.263 --> 18:29.566
Spoken like the wise
professor you are.

18:29.598 --> 18:30.733
Yeah.

18:32.201 --> 18:36.440
You're right, death is nothing to
be frightened of in and of itself,

18:36.838 --> 18:38.808
it's merely
the inheritance of life.

18:39.875 --> 18:43.245
But how one meets their deaths

18:43.278 --> 18:44.713
can be

18:44.747 --> 18:49.752
quite frightening and painful,

18:49.785 --> 18:52.189
beyond anything imaginable.

18:56.292 --> 18:58.261
What if we refuse to play along?

18:58.294 --> 18:59.963
[Emaramus]
What an excellent question!

19:00.962 --> 19:05.201
Well, that is when my reserved
judgment will come into play,

19:05.767 --> 19:07.938
and each and every one of you

19:08.804 --> 19:13.944
will meet unimaginable suffering
and anguish before you die.

19:14.809 --> 19:17.646
So what makes you think we won't
just vote each other out of here?

19:18.581 --> 19:21.818
Because I know you
better than you know yourself.

19:22.919 --> 19:24.153
I guarantee you.

19:25.287 --> 19:28.892
[water moving]

19:34.796 --> 19:39.736
How refreshing is the river
of life even among death, huh?

19:44.873 --> 19:47.643
Well, I'm excited.

19:50.179 --> 19:52.916
Who wants to give
the first account of a killing?

You, come. Come.

21:24.373 --> 21:26.142
Don't leave me.

21:26.174 --> 21:28.377
Stay. I'm not leaving,
I promise.

21:28.411 --> 21:31.881
Now! You go play goal man. Go.

Get up. Get up. Get up!

Please don't hurt her.
I'm sorry.

22:04.713 --> 22:06.281

You go play goal man now.

22:17.992 --> 22:19.261
Yeah.

22:19.295 --> 22:20.263
No!

22:21.363 --> 22:23.667
For every goal you let go,

22:24.299 --> 22:26.235
I will have my men
cut off her limb.

[Amadu] <i>That was the first time
I killed a man,</i>

24:57.018 --> 25:00.957
and with him died
all that I knew

25:02.324 --> 25:03.426
and loved.

25:04.526 --> 25:07.497
A land plagued by the chaos
of war and suffering,

25:08.229 --> 25:09.966
very little ever makes sense.

25:11.467 --> 25:15.305
How could you not help those
like the family that you lost?

25:20.409 --> 25:22.445
I believe you were trying to say

25:22.478 --> 25:24.881
that your fellow captives here
have been...

25:26.614 --> 25:28.218
how do you say,

25:29.450 --> 25:31.887
relating to the boy
that he had been.

25:32.988 --> 25:36.659
However, yet, that boy
died someplace

25:36.691 --> 25:39.228
between the death of his sister

25:39.260 --> 25:41.363
and the death of the man
that killed her.

25:42.331 --> 25:43.432
Right?

25:43.465 --> 25:46.336
Everyone must find
their own way in life.

25:47.436 --> 25:49.305
[Emaramus] But you didn't find
your own way.

25:50.005 --> 25:53.476
True. And I choose to accept it.

25:58.447 --> 25:59.548
[Amadu] <i>It was befitting</i>

25:59.582 --> 26:03.518

to avenge my sister</i>

<i>took me in as a son.</i>

26:06.455 --> 26:08.224

26:10.625 --> 26:15.998
Ghost educated me in the ways
of the uncivilized disguise

in the trimming
of the civilized world.

26:19.735 --> 26:22.204
[Amadu] <i>They also hire us</i>

26:22.237 --> 26:26.609

26:32.547 --> 26:34.717
[foreign language]

26:34.749 --> 26:40.390
Ghost taught me not only how
to survive in the cruel world

26:41.757 --> 26:46.228
where the weak are prey
for the rich and strong,

26:46.661 --> 26:49.932

You go on.

In the beginning, I was driven by a

<i>and we left my father.</i>

01:01:25.772 --> 01:01:29.643
I never saw him
again after that.

01:01:33.312 --> 01:01:36.716
I became pregnant as a result
of the rape,

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:39.520
and went through
a very difficult abortion.

01:01:41.754 --> 01:01:43.289
The following years,

01:01:44.623 --> 01:01:47.361
my mother took a very protective
role in my life,

01:01:47.393 --> 01:01:50.363
taking me to and from school.

01:01:51.665 --> 01:01:54.768
I immersed myself
in my schoolwork,

01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:59.306
and shied away from social
events or relationships, friends.

01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:01.341
[Marlene] <i>I hid myself.</i>

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:04.611
Oh, excuse me. Hey.
Hi, I'm Christopher.

01:02:04.643 --> 01:02:07.247
I'm sorry. I have
to get to class.

01:02:09.515 --> 01:02:13.520
And no matter what I tried,

01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:17.491
unwanted attention found me.

01:02:17.524 --> 01:02:19.359
You're not going to at least
tell me your name?

01:02:19.392 --> 01:02:22.663
Uh, um... uh, I... I really
have to get to class.

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:26.267
Sure, all right. Hey,
just at least let me take you to coffee.

01:02:26.632 --> 01:02:27.667
I'm sorry.

01:02:28.401 --> 01:02:29.402
I can't.

01:02:32.404 --> 01:02:35.776
Hey, hey, hey. Why are you being
such a stuck-up bitch, huh?

01:02:35.808 --> 01:02:38.411
Ah! Ugh.

01:02:38.444 --> 01:02:40.547
Hey, didn't she tell you
she had to go, man?

01:02:50.457 --> 01:02:52.225
I'm sorry about these guys.

01:02:52.259 --> 01:02:52.793
It's okay.

01:02:54.326 --> 01:02:55.428
My name is Samuel.

01:02:57.297 --> 01:02:59.400
Hi, I'm Marlene.

01:03:00.267 --> 01:03:01.868
Hi.

01:03:01.902 --> 01:03:04.538
[Marlene] <i>I never really felt safe
until Samuel stepped in that day.</i>

01:03:07.439 --> 01:03:10.877
I saw in him what my mother
didn't see in my father,

01:03:12.344 --> 01:03:14.281
someone who
could protect me.

01:03:15.848 --> 01:03:17.651
[Marlene] <i>He was ambitious.</i>

01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:19.553
He knew what he wanted.

01:03:20.286 --> 01:03:21.821
I love your daughter
very much.

01:03:25.692 --> 01:03:27.394
Marry me?

01:03:40.806 --> 01:03:42.810
[Marlene] <i>We bought
a beautiful home together.</i>

01:03:45.844 --> 01:03:48.482
<i>He made me smile every day.</i>

01:03:49.815 --> 01:03:52.752
The only thing that Samuel
and I wanted more

01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:56.623
than each other was a family.

01:03:58.290 --> 01:03:59.493
In due time,

01:03:59.526 --> 01:04:03.397
we discovered
that I couldn't conceive.

01:04:05.765 --> 01:04:08.634
The doctor told us that my

01:04:08.667 --> 01:04:14.274
cervix was permanently
damaged from the abortion.

01:04:17.544 --> 01:04:19.547
Lord, you look gorgeous
this evening!

01:04:22.448 --> 01:04:25.752
Oh, God, I miss this.

01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:30.757
You know, it's time for a toast.

01:04:36.296 --> 01:04:38.299
It's when I confided in Samuel

01:04:38.698 --> 01:04:40.301
about the rape

01:04:41.835 --> 01:04:45.573
and he changed.

01:04:53.613 --> 01:04:56.382
[Marlene]
<i>He felt that I had deceived him,</i>

01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:59.620
<i>that I had lied about who I was</i>

01:05:00.886 --> 01:05:03.289
<i>and what I could give him.</i>

01:05:04.524 --> 01:05:05.859
God, you're gorgeous.

01:05:07.294 --> 01:05:08.295
To us!

01:05:08.661 --> 01:05:11.397
To us. Cheers!

01:05:12.899 --> 01:05:16.670
[Samuel] No, what are you doing?

01:05:16.703 --> 01:05:18.839
Tonight we celebrate. Drink up.

01:05:27.547 --> 01:05:29.917
You want to dance with me?

01:05:42.661 --> 01:05:44.297
You're so gorgeous.

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:46.299
Samuel.

01:05:46.332 --> 01:05:46.866
Yeah.

01:05:47.701 --> 01:05:49.503
My... my head...

01:05:51.471 --> 01:05:52.539
Go on.

01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:53.640
Samuel.

01:06:11.424 --> 01:06:12.726
[camera turning on]

01:06:48.727 --> 01:06:49.829
[man] <i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:55.134 --> 01:06:57.337
[man] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:07:00.105 --> 01:07:02.609
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:07:05.145 --> 01:07:07.848
I don't have to tell you how
this changes everything.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:22.429
Infidelity is something
that I just won't tolerate.

01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:25.532
[Samuel] I want you out!

01:07:29.468 --> 01:07:31.871
I want you out
of my home immediately.

01:07:31.904 --> 01:07:32.939
Why...

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.075
Why like this?

01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:40.447
[sobbing]

01:07:41.114 --> 01:07:42.483
Well this,

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:46.853
this is for wasting
my fucking time.

01:08:06.672 --> 01:08:09.542
Oh, so, you want
to kill me, huh?

01:08:15.814 --> 01:08:16.884
Come on then!

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:18.751
[thud]

01:08:33.867 --> 01:08:36.470
[Marlene]
<i>The police ruled it an accident.</i>

01:08:36.903 --> 01:08:41.207
<i>I found the copies he made
of the tape and destroyed them.</i>

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:45.679
A blinding hatred

01:08:45.711 --> 01:08:49.881
for those who take and take

01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:54.488
from everyone
and everything around them

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.622
until there is
nothing left to take

01:08:57.657 --> 01:09:01.495
and then they find reason
to take even more.

You going to blame every man or

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.122
[Romero]
Yeah, you're one sick poodle.

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:05.259
Who are you to call her sick?
What if you were raped?

01:10:05.892 --> 01:10:09.696
What they did to me only helped
me to see the evil that men do.

01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:15.268
Helped you to see the evil
that men do.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:20.806
Like, you make that sound
so enlightening, profound even.

01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:24.811
But what truths do these words
really hold, Ms. Gunthery?

01:10:24.844 --> 01:10:27.881
I mean, what evil did you see

01:10:29.282 --> 01:10:31.184

01:10:39.759 --> 01:10:42.696
Well, anyway, I was passing,
I had to come in.

01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:46.899
And?

01:10:48.635 --> 01:10:50.938
I was hoping there was someone
I could speak to about my work.

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:52.872
Not interested.

01:10:54.674 --> 01:10:56.676
Well, come on.
You haven't even seen it.

01:10:57.242 --> 01:10:59.779
Look, I'm going
to leave my information.

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.882

[Marlene] Who is she?

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.262
Some model I met
a few years ago.

01:11:49.295 --> 01:11:51.163
We've done
a few pieces together.

01:11:52.331 --> 01:11:55.335
It's the loneliness in her pose
I most want to communicate.

01:11:55.367 --> 01:11:56.402
Hmm.

01:11:57.703 --> 01:11:58.871
I can see that.

01:11:59.906 --> 01:12:01.174
Except...

01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:08.814
[Marlene] The shading here just
bleeds into the sunlight a little.

01:12:08.848 --> 01:12:09.850
Where?

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:15.455
[Marlene] <i>He was more interested
in figure painting</i>

01:12:15.487 --> 01:12:17.423
<i>as a way to manipulate women
into his bed</i>

01:12:17.456 --> 01:12:21.961
<i>than as a form
of artistic expression.</i>

01:12:24.464 --> 01:12:25.931
<i>He was a man.</i>

01:12:26.866 --> 01:12:31.270
<i>And I know the evil that men do.</i>

01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:37.743
Mr. Fofana, what is your opinion of Ms.
Gunthery's action?

01:12:39.412 --> 01:12:40.981
I have no opinion.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.782
Really?

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:44.416
Why is that?

01:12:44.451 --> 01:12:48.221
One's hardships are measured
by one's own experiences.

01:12:49.322 --> 01:12:52.392
It's not the hardships that are
in question here though.

01:12:53.358 --> 01:12:54.593
It's not the point.

01:12:54.626 --> 01:12:59.799
[Emaramus] It's the reaction,
the response to the hardships.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.002
Mr. Tiddleman,

01:13:03.269 --> 01:13:05.305
what have your hardships led to?

01:13:06.238 --> 01:13:11.310
Not... not to make light of any...

01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:14.214
what anyone else here has gone
through, you know,

01:13:14.246 --> 01:13:16.815
but the only hardships
I've known

01:13:16.849 --> 01:13:22.322
are deciding how to engage
and prepare my students

01:13:22.354 --> 01:13:23.889
for this ever-changing life,

01:13:23.922 --> 01:13:28.495
and you never know
what awaits us.

01:13:34.332 --> 01:13:36.870
I... I don't... I don't...
I don't belong here.

01:13:40.473 --> 01:13:41.475
Wow,

01:13:42.475 --> 01:13:45.511
you really are the most
intriguing of the bunch.

01:13:45.545 --> 01:13:47.413
I got to give you that.

01:13:47.446 --> 01:13:50.550
See, I don't have anything to go
on, Mr. Tiddleman, I'll be honest.

01:13:50.582 --> 01:13:52.484
I only briefly observed you

01:13:52.518 --> 01:13:56.389
in pursuit of that little blonde
girl, your co-worker.

01:13:57.823 --> 01:13:59.392
That's the goddamn truth.

01:13:59.925 --> 01:14:01.260
[Emaramus] So you say.

01:14:02.327 --> 01:14:04.196
How's the ex?

01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:05.297
Uh, she's okay.

01:14:06.698 --> 01:14:09.568
But hey, you know, you'd better make
a move on Christine before I do,

01:14:09.602 --> 01:14:12.839
because once she gets to know the
Dunkin, it might be difficult for you.

01:14:14.273 --> 01:14:15.242
[Emaramus] <i>You know,</i>

01:14:16.509 --> 01:14:20.913
I got you pegged as an
opportunistic killer, Mr. Tiddleman.

01:14:22.614 --> 01:14:26.486
I think you select your victims

01:14:26.519 --> 01:14:27.787
more or less

01:14:27.821 --> 01:14:31.858
the way in which you came to
join us here tonight, by chance.

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:36.295
But I'm willing to bet it hasn't
always been that way. Hmm.

01:14:36.328 --> 01:14:38.898
I'm no more a killer than you
are the King of England.

01:14:43.402 --> 01:14:45.272
You have me figured wrong.

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:52.312
Please, I just want to go back
to my students, please.

01:14:52.345 --> 01:14:53.513
- Nah.
- [Curtis] Please.

01:14:58.216 --> 01:15:02.822
First, your story.
We'll let your peers decide.

01:15:03.456 --> 01:15:06.926
I swear,
I'm not a killer, I swear.

01:15:09.495 --> 01:15:12.631
- Your story, Professor.
- [beeping]

01:15:12.665 --> 01:15:14.533
- [buzzing]
- Ahh!

01:15:19.371 --> 01:15:21.907
[Emaramus]
Your story, Professor.

01:15:24.443 --> 01:15:25.678
- [buzzing]
- [Curtis screaming]

01:15:25.711 --> 01:15:28.448
All right, already. All right,
yo, what are you going to do?

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.483
You... you're going to kill him
before we even vote?

01:15:31.684 --> 01:15:34.988
Is that compassion I hear
in your voice, Mr. Scaranelli?

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.889
If I wasn't strapped
to this chair,

01:15:36.922 --> 01:15:40.359
I would stand up and give you a
big New York finger to fuck off.

01:15:41.527 --> 01:15:45.899
I've... I've never killed anyone.

01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:47.934
Well, that's not for me
to decide.

01:15:49.035 --> 01:15:51.037
That's for all of you to decide.

01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:53.239
[Emaramus] Mr. Tiddleman

01:15:53.706 --> 01:15:55.575
refuses to give an account,

01:15:56.408 --> 01:15:59.011
and he denies that he's anything
like the rest of you,

01:15:59.545 --> 01:16:01.948
but know that it is my opinion,

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:04.350
he poses a greater threat
than any of you combined.

01:16:07.653 --> 01:16:09.356
The voting shall begin.

01:16:09.956 --> 01:16:12.325
[Emaramus] Beneath the arms
of each of your chairs,

01:16:12.358 --> 01:16:15.361
if you haven't already noticed,
are two buttons.

01:16:15.394 --> 01:16:17.597
To the right, a vote of death.

01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:20.033
Left, a vote for freedom.

01:16:21.533 --> 01:16:23.370
We'll begin with Mr. Fofana.

01:16:27.439 --> 01:16:29.276
Your vote, Mr. Fofana.

01:16:31.111 --> 01:16:35.047
[Amadu] <i>In the beginning, I was driven by
a sense of loyalty and gratitude to Ghost.</i>

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:38.718
[Lucy] <i>How were the rest of the
families caught in the middle of it,</i>

01:16:38.751 --> 01:16:40.320
<i>like you and your family
had been?</i>

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.723
- [Amadu] <i>I chose survival.</i>
- [shooting]

01:16:43.755 --> 01:16:47.626
[Marlene] <i>How could you not help
families like the one you lost?</i>

01:16:52.497 --> 01:16:54.366
So, what is it we're
doing here, again?

01:16:54.399 --> 01:16:56.036
Vote or I'll vote for you.

01:16:56.635 --> 01:16:58.505
I wouldn't want to give
you the pleasure.

01:17:00.538 --> 01:17:01.541
[beeping]

01:17:02.707 --> 01:17:06.412
[Amadu] <i>Everyone must find
their own way in life.</i>

01:17:09.614 --> 01:17:11.017
[Emaramus] Mr. Tiddleman.

01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:14.419
You know, before we proceed,

01:17:14.452 --> 01:17:18.657
I really do have to commend you
on your little act today.

01:17:19.457 --> 01:17:21.728
Classic psychopath.

01:17:22.495 --> 01:17:25.230
But I guess we're going to find out
how far that's going to get you.

01:17:26.665 --> 01:17:28.234
We'll have you vote now.

01:17:28.634 --> 01:17:29.569
No.

01:17:30.769 --> 01:17:32.471
Vote, Professor.

01:17:32.505 --> 01:17:33.473
I won't.

01:17:34.639 --> 01:17:36.008
It's not right.

01:17:43.248 --> 01:17:44.483
Okay.

01:17:46.385 --> 01:17:49.055
I have enjoyed it, I do,

01:17:49.822 --> 01:17:52.325
this little game you're playing.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.260
So persistent.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.496
Look at me, Mr. Tiddleman.

01:17:58.397 --> 01:17:59.399
Look!

01:18:01.399 --> 01:18:04.504
You know, I really don't know
why you continue to persist.

01:18:05.403 --> 01:18:07.506
None of them can hear us.
It's just us.

01:18:09.274 --> 01:18:12.210
I'm right about you.
You're like me.

01:18:12.243 --> 01:18:13.645
You don't know me.

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.749
You don't know me.

01:18:20.251 --> 01:18:21.254
Okay.

01:18:22.487 --> 01:18:24.356
- [Curtis coughing]
- Here's what I'm gonna do.

01:18:28.493 --> 01:18:29.795
Each vote of yours

01:18:31.397 --> 01:18:34.267
does not exist, a non-vote

01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:37.437
will be considered a vote
for your own death

01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:40.740
and whoever you don't vote upon,
and I'm going to give you ten seconds.

01:18:40.773 --> 01:18:42.675
- [clock ticking]
- Oh. No.

01:18:43.408 --> 01:18:44.710
No.

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:49.548
[Emaramus] <i>We will now vote
on Ms. Lucy Black.</i>

01:18:54.286 --> 01:18:56.256
You have ten seconds.

01:18:59.457 --> 01:19:01.393
Tick-tock, Professor.

01:19:02.862 --> 01:19:03.830
No.

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:05.698
Ten seconds.

01:19:11.269 --> 01:19:12.471
[Curtis] I'm not going to do it.

01:19:13.404 --> 01:19:14.773
- [Curtis] I'm not.
- Time's up.

01:19:18.443 --> 01:19:20.779
Romero's fate will be next.

01:19:20.813 --> 01:19:24.818
Hey, buddy, it's buy and read,
not the other way around.

01:19:26.484 --> 01:19:27.652
[shooting]

01:19:27.685 --> 01:19:29.555
You keep the change.

01:19:30.656 --> 01:19:32.757
Retirement
might be just around the corner.

01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:34.828
[Lucy]
<i>You're such an arrogant prick.</i>

01:19:36.394 --> 01:19:38.297
<i>Sounds like he got off on it.</i>

01:19:42.268 --> 01:19:45.572
[Romero] <i>Never in a billion years would I
have imagined it ended the way that it did.</i>

01:19:50.376 --> 01:19:54.480
[Emaramus] We will now vote
on Curtis Tiddleman.

01:19:54.513 --> 01:19:57.649
And do not let his boyish charms
and tears fool you.

01:19:58.617 --> 01:20:02.388
[Emaramus] <i>Mr. Tiddleman,
what have your hardships led to?</i>

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:07.559
I swear to you,
I am not a killer.

01:20:10.595 --> 01:20:12.497
Think of it this way.

01:20:12.531 --> 01:20:15.268
You may never get another
chance to vent your hate.

01:20:15.867 --> 01:20:17.536
[Emaramus] So, what will it be?

01:20:19.671 --> 01:20:20.772
[beeping]

01:20:22.474 --> 01:20:23.643
Mr. Scaranelli,

01:20:24.742 --> 01:20:26.645
you're really
trying my patience.

01:20:26.679 --> 01:20:30.483
You have voted three times
consecutively for freedom.

01:20:31.282 --> 01:20:35.854
You're making me question your involvement
in the integrity of my process.

01:20:35.888 --> 01:20:39.257
So, I have made a new decision.

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:42.395
Any non-vote by you
or vote of freedom again

01:20:42.428 --> 01:20:44.729
will constitute
a vote of death for yourself.

01:20:44.763 --> 01:20:47.834
Didn't I tell you that rules
only serve one purpose?

01:20:54.406 --> 01:20:58.411
Finally, to decide
on the fate of Ms. Gunthery.

01:21:00.813 --> 01:21:03.850
[Romero] <i>You're going to blame every man
for what two fucking sickos did to you?</i>

01:21:05.317 --> 01:21:09.322
It wasn't a judgment based
on observation, it was a fact.

01:21:09.354 --> 01:21:10.388
[man choking]

01:21:10.421 --> 01:21:11.657
He was a man.

01:21:13.492 --> 01:21:16.262
Could you do me the courtesy

01:21:16.295 --> 01:21:20.466
of relieving my curiosity
and casting your own vote?

01:21:30.408 --> 01:21:31.810
Just as I thought.

01:21:32.745 --> 01:21:34.346
[beeping]

01:21:37.715 --> 01:21:39.285
Mr. Tiddleman,

01:21:40.885 --> 01:21:44.523
I can't help but notice, but all of your
voting seems to be to free your peers.

01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:46.526
Why is that?

01:21:46.892 --> 01:21:48.694
You wanted me to vote.

01:21:50.696 --> 01:21:52.430
I'm voting.

01:21:52.464 --> 01:21:55.702
Yes, but your voting lacks
the judgment of the truth

01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:58.604
or truth of judgment that were.

01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:00.806
Either way, it's boring.

01:22:02.507 --> 01:22:04.544
What do you mean?
These are your rules.

01:22:05.477 --> 01:22:09.047
Yes, and rules, like laws,
are amended every day,

01:22:09.081 --> 01:22:13.453
so, a vote of freedom
for Mrs. Gunthery

01:22:14.086 --> 01:22:16.289
will now be a vote
of death for you.

01:22:17.723 --> 01:22:19.292
That's not fair.

01:22:20.392 --> 01:22:21.661
You have ten seconds.

01:22:23.028 --> 01:22:25.531
You keep changing the rules because
you're going to kill us all.

01:22:25.563 --> 01:22:27.732
- [clock ticking]
- Five seconds.

01:22:27.765 --> 01:22:29.602
- [Curtis] You're lying.
- Three.

01:22:30.102 --> 01:22:32.505
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:22:33.738 --> 01:22:34.741
Oh.

01:22:39.478 --> 01:22:40.846
[Emaramus] Well done.

01:22:41.714 --> 01:22:42.814
Bravo!

01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:46.318
Well,

01:22:47.419 --> 01:22:49.921
all things must run
their course,

01:22:51.556 --> 01:22:53.393
even curses.

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:59.899
[switches flipping]

01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:11.877
Hmm.

01:23:12.577 --> 01:23:13.678
Ah.

01:23:13.711 --> 01:23:15.714
[moaning]

01:23:15.747 --> 01:23:17.716
[Curtis coughing]

01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:26.392
Ugh...

01:23:27.693 --> 01:23:28.795
He let us go.

01:23:30.696 --> 01:23:31.698
He didn't.

01:23:33.866 --> 01:23:35.368
The others did.

01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:37.403
Where are we?

01:23:41.139 --> 01:23:44.443
Hang on, I think I see
my car over there.

01:23:51.916 --> 01:23:52.817
What?

01:23:52.852 --> 01:23:54.819
Look, I don't know
what you're thinking,

01:23:54.853 --> 01:23:57.523
but I'm definitely done with
whatever just happened over there,

01:23:57.555 --> 01:23:58.590
and that's including you.

01:24:00.459 --> 01:24:02.662
Oh, God!
Please don't leave me. Hey!

01:24:03.429 --> 01:24:04.997
Hey, please don't leave me.

01:24:05.031 --> 01:24:07.533
Listen, if you're worried about what
happened, you don't have to be, I promise.

01:24:07.565 --> 01:24:09.868
I won't tell anyone anything.
I promise.

01:24:09.902 --> 01:24:10.870
Come on.

01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:13.138
[Curtis] Thank you.

01:24:14.773 --> 01:24:16.843
Lucy. Lucy. Lucy.

01:24:17.742 --> 01:24:19.678
- Lucy.
- Jesus! What?

01:24:19.711 --> 01:24:21.581
I'm sorry about your mother.

01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:25.785
Yeah, thanks.

01:24:33.759 --> 01:24:34.727
Shit!

01:24:40.165 --> 01:24:41.366
What?

01:24:41.399 --> 01:24:44.636
It's just you... you don't seem
fazed by what just happened.

01:24:45.737 --> 01:24:46.639
So?

01:24:47.473 --> 01:24:49.609
So, that... that guy, who was he?

01:24:50.742 --> 01:24:52.578
How did he know
the things he knew?

01:24:52.611 --> 01:24:53.578
I don't know.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.216
I think he might have been tied
up with Madam Nadia somehow.

01:24:57.248 --> 01:24:59.117
But also, who gives a fuck, yo?

01:25:00.251 --> 01:25:02.086
I told you I was leaving
this shit behind me.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.823
Fucking let it go.
We're alive, aren't we?

01:25:05.523 --> 01:25:06.658
Are we safe?

01:25:07.626 --> 01:25:09.695
How do you know
he won't come after us?

01:25:09.728 --> 01:25:10.630
Look,

01:25:11.263 --> 01:25:13.433
this shit might be new to you,

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.868
but I've been living it
through my entire fucking life,

01:25:16.902 --> 01:25:19.904
so, if you feel the need to burden me with
your shit, get the fuck out of my car.

01:25:19.938 --> 01:25:20.940
No.

01:25:24.776 --> 01:25:27.546
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Shh!

01:25:29.614 --> 01:25:30.817
Ugh!

01:25:36.255 --> 01:25:37.523
[coughing]

01:25:37.555 --> 01:25:39.625
Do you know this level of fear?

01:25:43.862 --> 01:25:46.899
[both struggling]

01:25:47.733 --> 01:25:49.268
Ahh!

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.502
You motherfucker.

01:26:32.743 --> 01:26:35.848
[grunting]

01:26:39.885 --> 01:26:41.187
- [buzzing]
- [screaming]

01:26:50.228 --> 01:26:52.797
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:26:53.764 --> 01:26:54.767
Oh, shit!

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.236
Shit!

01:26:57.269 --> 01:27:01.806
[breathing heavily]

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.775
Fuck.

01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:27.832
Fuck.

01:27:28.966 --> 01:27:30.335
Oh, fuck.

01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:33.940
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

01:27:35.706 --> 01:27:37.910
Ah! Stop!

01:27:38.644 --> 01:27:40.813
[Lucy] Stop! Get off!

01:27:42.913 --> 01:27:48.688
[gasping and coughing]

01:27:55.426 --> 01:27:56.761
Shh.

01:27:57.795 --> 01:27:58.897
Shh.

01:27:59.764 --> 01:28:01.633
Shh. Shh.

01:28:06.042 --> 01:28:08.333
[foreign language]
Rot in hell!

01:28:31.697 --> 01:28:35.968
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [police radio chattering]

01:28:44.776 --> 01:28:46.845
Professor Curtis Tiddleman.

01:29:13.904 --> 01:29:17.777
Police! Stop right there!
Down on your knees. Now!

01:29:21.846 --> 01:29:22.782
In here.

01:29:45.437 --> 01:29:46.906
I was going to tell you.

01:29:47.371 --> 01:29:48.406
I'm sorry.

01:30:10.929 --> 01:30:15.367
- [police radio chattering]
- [police sirens sounding]

01:30:42.861 --> 01:30:47.866
[woman crying]

01:30:47.898 --> 01:30:48.867
[woman] No.

01:30:57.309 --> 01:30:59.545
[screaming]

01:30:59.577 --> 01:31:03.848
- Shh! Shh!
- [yelling]

01:31:03.881 --> 01:31:06.919
Shh! Shh!

01:31:23.468 --> 01:31:25.571
...California's
maximum-security prison,

01:31:25.604 --> 01:31:29.541
where the execution of Curtis Tiddleman
has been scheduled for November 3rd.

01:31:29.573 --> 01:31:32.844
The former college professor has
opted to allow his execution

01:31:32.877 --> 01:31:35.179
without exhausting
any of his appeals.

01:31:35.212 --> 01:31:37.349
Tiddleman had
been convicted of the murder

01:31:37.381 --> 01:31:39.852
of seven women
and seven teenage boys

01:31:39.885 --> 01:31:43.322
and is believed to be responsible
for potentially a dozen others.

01:31:43.354 --> 01:31:45.957
Five years ago,
police received an anonymous tip

01:31:45.991 --> 01:31:47.926
that a woman
had been abducted by a man

01:31:47.959 --> 01:31:49.560
and driven away
in her own car.

01:31:49.594 --> 01:31:53.399
That woman was
25-year-old Lucia Perez.

01:32:08.545 --> 01:32:10.281
[Emaramus] <i>Hello, Professor.</i>

01:32:10.648 --> 01:32:13.317
