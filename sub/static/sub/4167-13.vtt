00:02.077 --> 00:04.246
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:06.248 --> 00:07.791
"Whore."

00:07.875 --> 00:09.877
Fucking pregnant again.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.463
Some Indian kid I mercy fucked for U-Turn.

00:12.546 --> 00:16.050
Ain't nothing to say, faggot,
except "send money. "

00:16.133 --> 00:18.552
- I thought you were dating me.
- I am.

00:18.636 --> 00:20.721
So I'm just something for you
to rub up against.

00:20.846 --> 00:21.847
Silas, don't do this.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.516
Thug means never having to say you're sorry.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.353
- Kids need to know if there's danger.
- What kind of danger?

00:27.436 --> 00:29.063
Big, scary men with guns.

00:29.188 --> 00:33.776
I've been doing some research on the internet
and I really think Pittsburgh is the place for us.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.152
That little thing's a camera?

00:35.236 --> 00:37.529
I can broadcast the image
to any computer in the house.

00:37.613 --> 00:42.952
Dumb-name will know my wrath,
the wrath of Doug. It's coming.

00:43.035 --> 00:46.413
- Andy, meet Chess.
- You wanna buy from me?

00:46.497 --> 00:50.709
Why don't you let Ms Botwin know
it's available if she's interested?

00:50.793 --> 00:52.878
Oh, yeah. I'm bad. Punish me.

00:55.297 --> 00:58.968
You will start paying
for the many sins against me.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.012
I need to rent your empty house.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.890
We need a grow house.
Can you deal with that?

01:04.974 --> 01:06.058
Slut.

01:17.194 --> 01:20.030
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:20.114 --> 01:22.449
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:22.533 --> 01:25.160
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:25.244 --> 01:27.788
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:27.872 --> 01:30.875
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:30.958 --> 01:33.794
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:33.836 --> 01:36.630
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:36.714 --> 01:39.717
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:39.800 --> 01:43.095
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:43.220 --> 01:46.515
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:46.599 --> 01:49.226
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

01:49.310 --> 01:52.438
<i># And they all came out the same</i>

01:52.521 --> 01:55.941
<i># And there's doctors and lawyers</i>

01:56.025 --> 01:58.819
<i># And business executives</i>

01:58.903 --> 02:02.406
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

02:02.489 --> 02:06.827
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:27.097 --> 02:30.351
And where were you last night, young lady?

02:30.434 --> 02:31.477
Sinner.

02:32.645 --> 02:36.273
- Why is this cross in my house?
- Andy said I could put it here.

02:37.316 --> 02:38.943
- Andy?
- Let me ask you something.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.154
You think our customers might be interested

02:42.238 --> 02:45.991
in some lovely outdoor-grown biker bammy?

02:47.117 --> 02:48.118
How did it get in here?

02:48.202 --> 02:50.371
Oh, it wasn't easy. Let me say that right now.

02:50.454 --> 02:51.664
And getting it outta here?

02:51.747 --> 02:54.667
Ooh, I'm gonna say near impossible on that one.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.711
Make the impossible possible, Doug.

02:57.795 --> 03:00.381
Why don't I come back
after you've had your coffee?

03:00.464 --> 03:01.590
Yeah, why don't you?

03:01.674 --> 03:04.176
I think it wouldn't be a terrible idea

03:04.260 --> 03:07.012
if we had an alternative source for weed.

03:07.096 --> 03:09.765
- Bikers?
- Motorcycle club.

03:09.807 --> 03:11.267
They're great.

03:11.350 --> 03:13.269
It's a family business, brother and sister.

03:13.352 --> 03:15.521
- You met a biker girl?
- No.

03:16.355 --> 03:19.024
Yeah. No. She's not a girl. She's a woman.

03:19.149 --> 03:20.568
Of course she is.

03:20.651 --> 03:21.819
Discussion over.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.697
But this has nothing to do with her.
It's an opportunity.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.616
- Where were you all night?
- I was working.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.785
You have a working mother, Shane.

03:29.869 --> 03:30.870
Them's the breaks.

03:30.953 --> 03:34.248
What's wrong with offering
another choice to our clients?

03:34.331 --> 03:35.875
They aren't looking for choices.

03:35.958 --> 03:38.127
People are too overwhelmed by choice.

03:38.210 --> 03:40.212
- They seek simplicity.
- I'm not buying it.

03:40.296 --> 03:44.884
This is a culture where you can order
coffee 80 million ways, and people love it.

03:44.967 --> 03:47.011
Chess just wants you to think about it.

03:48.345 --> 03:49.722
Chess...

03:49.805 --> 03:52.057
wants me to think about it?

03:53.267 --> 03:55.936
How does Chess know what I do?

03:56.020 --> 03:58.188
Yeah. That was kinda creepy.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.065
He seemed to know a lot about you.

04:00.149 --> 04:01.859
That's not good.

04:01.942 --> 04:05.029
Right, Shane. Very observant.
That's not good.

04:05.863 --> 04:09.200
Don't cock-block me on this, Nance.
She's really hot.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.369
See how many bricks he'll trade me
for a giant cross.

04:13.746 --> 04:15.539
How the hell did he get it in here?

04:15.623 --> 04:17.666
I believe it's a miracle.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.711
I don't believe in miracles.

04:21.712 --> 04:23.964
I believe in Pittsburgh.

04:26.717 --> 04:29.470
I swear I think the sky is bluer over here.

04:29.553 --> 04:35.351
No graffiti, no drunks and junkies.
Shoot, I'll take it. How long we staying?

04:35.434 --> 04:37.978
This is temporary, little girl.
And don't kid yourself.

04:38.062 --> 04:40.189
There's plenty of drunks
and junkies out here.

04:40.272 --> 04:43.108
They just ain't on the corner
cos they got air-conditioning.

04:43.192 --> 04:44.652
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.822
- Did you hear how high her voice got?
- Mm-hm.

04:48.906 --> 04:50.658
She think we gonna jump her.

04:50.741 --> 04:52.993
That's why we gonna be just fine.

04:53.035 --> 04:54.828
How do you figure?

04:54.912 --> 04:57.456
There's only one thing
more powerful than white fear...

04:57.540 --> 04:59.083
- Mm.
... and that's white guilt.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.502
- Mm.
- Now, they say, "Good morning,"

05:01.585 --> 05:04.255
but what they're really saying is,
"I'm not racist. "

05:04.338 --> 05:06.090
Look at this one coming up here.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.301
- Hello, there. How are you?
- Good morning to you.

05:09.802 --> 05:11.220
Ooh, yeah.

05:11.303 --> 05:15.307
They gonna treat us like Maya Angelou
and Condoleezza Rice.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.947
So, how we doing here?

05:30.030 --> 05:33.951
Well, a lot of the plants
that were ready for harvest didn't make it,

05:34.034 --> 05:36.662
and we're dealing with a lot less space here.

05:36.787 --> 05:38.247
You are asking about the crop?

05:39.206 --> 05:41.667
Yes. I'm asking about the crop.

05:41.750 --> 05:45.004
- I'm running low.
- I can't fill you back up right now.

05:46.005 --> 05:50.050
- I'm thinking of opening up another supply line.
- With who?

05:50.134 --> 05:54.305
There's this biker chick that Andy wants to fuck
and a guy named Chess.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.932
18-foot cross in my house... I don't know.

05:57.016 --> 06:00.644
Well, it's gonna be a little dry
around here for a while.

06:01.937 --> 06:03.981
Then I'll do it.

06:05.608 --> 06:08.652
Ooh, Lord!

06:08.736 --> 06:11.822
I can smell this house
from two fucking blocks away.

06:11.906 --> 06:15.409
Smells like a skunk massacre
happening up in here.

06:15.492 --> 06:19.538
- What you gonna do?
- How about this for a game plan?

06:19.580 --> 06:22.374
I grow inside,
you and Vaneeta grow outside.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.043
Rosemary, lavender.

06:24.126 --> 06:27.421
Fine. As soon as I make
a little something to eat, I'll get to it.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.342
You need a shower.

06:32.426 --> 06:36.180
- What, you don't want to stay and help?
- I haven't got the green thumb.

06:38.682 --> 06:41.185
She just got the white attitude.

06:41.227 --> 06:43.729
Yeah. That's all I'm saying, Bill.

06:43.812 --> 06:47.942
We substitute the cheap drywall
from China, it'll save us a ton.

06:56.867 --> 07:00.704
- Hey, there. How you doin'?
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

07:23.769 --> 07:26.272
You know, I hope for Nancy's sake

07:26.313 --> 07:27.398
that you used a condom.

07:28.232 --> 07:30.901
God forbid you should replicate.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.159
God bless you all.

07:43.289 --> 07:45.124
My decorator.

07:45.207 --> 07:47.585
We're doing a little remodelling.

07:55.301 --> 07:58.345
I want to be part of the team,
one of the cool kids.

07:58.429 --> 08:00.472
What can I do?
What can I do? What can I do?

08:00.556 --> 08:03.434
Ain't nothing for you to do
but collect your rent every month.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.186
Oh, sure.
Everyone gets to have fun except me.

08:06.270 --> 08:09.023
Well, fuck that shit. I am here to kick ass!

08:09.648 --> 08:13.152
- Whose ass?
- Whoever gets in my way. Come on.

08:13.235 --> 08:15.946
Let me do something fun. Come on. Please.

08:16.030 --> 08:19.158
I am on a real high here.
Do not bring me down.

08:19.241 --> 08:21.493
OK, Gangster Barbie,
I will figure something out.

08:21.577 --> 08:23.996
You'll see. I'm good. I'm ready.

08:24.079 --> 08:27.249
I will not disappoint you.
I'll be a great soldier.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.001
I'm sure you will. Hold this.

08:31.795 --> 08:34.465
I'm helping Daddy, aren't I?

08:43.349 --> 08:44.350
Whoa!

08:46.644 --> 08:49.772
What took you so long?
I texted you over two hours ago.

08:49.855 --> 08:53.984
- You're not my only customer, Sully.
- I really need to smoke out.

08:54.068 --> 08:57.029
I'll bet. What happened?

08:57.112 --> 09:00.199
It's just a signal
that it's time for me to move on.

09:03.661 --> 09:08.165
Forward to my next
shitty, prefab Jesus town.

09:08.249 --> 09:12.378
Hey, you know
I take this Jesus stuff seriously.

09:12.461 --> 09:14.964
- Sorry.
- Shame you have to go.

09:15.798 --> 09:17.967
You're one of my best customers.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.593
You could go with me.

09:19.677 --> 09:21.971
Huh. No, thanks.

09:22.054 --> 09:26.600
I'm happy here
in my shitty, prefab Jesus town.

09:28.185 --> 09:29.395
Shame.

09:31.522 --> 09:34.608
<i>What can I do for you, Pot Mommy?</i>

09:34.692 --> 09:37.778
My horny lieutenant tells me
you may have some product for me.

09:37.861 --> 09:39.780
Oh, now. Low on the MILF, huh?

09:41.031 --> 09:44.660
You seem to know so much about me.
I know nothing about you.

09:44.743 --> 09:45.744
Doesn't seem fair.

09:45.828 --> 09:48.163
You should've checked out
my Facebook page.

09:48.247 --> 09:50.457
Hey, wanna play some Risk?

09:50.541 --> 09:51.750
- I'm in.
- Andy.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.295
- What?
- Mommy's all business, I see.

09:54.378 --> 09:58.716
You know what? OK.
Let me show you what I got for you. Hm?

09:58.799 --> 10:02.761
Risk is all about Kamchatka.
That's your gateway to the West.

10:02.845 --> 10:05.139
Uh-huh? Think you're telling me
something I don't know?

10:05.222 --> 10:08.100
Your housewives will love it.

10:08.183 --> 10:10.394
Make 'em forget
that their husbands won't fuck 'em.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.731
- How much?
- Five for a pound.

10:14.356 --> 10:15.524
That's a fair price.

10:17.318 --> 10:18.736
Yeah.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.571
For a full pound.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.616
Yeah, it might be a little short. You're good.

10:23.699 --> 10:27.203
All right, tell you what, 10% discount. Mm?

10:27.286 --> 10:29.580
You know what,
take the first one on consignment.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.333
Why would you go
and do something like that?

10:32.416 --> 10:34.418
Cos I can tell you'll be a loyal customer.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.462
I'm all about loyal customers.

10:36.545 --> 10:40.424
But you bring me back that five grand real soon.

10:40.507 --> 10:45.304
Er, 10% off is, erm, $4500, right?

10:47.806 --> 10:49.475
- Yeah.
- Chess, is it?

10:49.600 --> 10:51.936
- Yeah.
- Is that short for Chester?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.520
No.

10:53.604 --> 10:55.981
It is. He hates it.

10:56.774 --> 10:59.902
- See you soon, Pot Mommy.
- See you soon, Chester.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.821
Hey, I challenge you to a game,
one-on-one.

11:03.405 --> 11:05.783
- Winner takes all.
- All of what?

11:08.702 --> 11:11.163
Oh, winner takes all, Nance!

11:27.429 --> 11:29.098
Uncle Andy?!

11:32.601 --> 11:33.852
Silas?

11:36.772 --> 11:37.940
Mom?

11:39.483 --> 11:40.693
Mom?

11:44.530 --> 11:46.782
Mom? Mom?

11:57.251 --> 12:02.882
Front door. Side. Back.

12:10.264 --> 12:11.473
Hey.

12:13.225 --> 12:15.686
Yeah, it's just a bug in the system.

12:23.444 --> 12:24.987
Ugh.

12:25.070 --> 12:28.282
This is so not what I had in mind.

12:30.618 --> 12:35.122
Conrad said you wanted to get dirty.
Now you're dirty.

12:35.831 --> 12:38.334
Hand me some more of that sage, Princess.

12:38.417 --> 12:42.171
Make it smell Italian out here
instead of Jamaican.

12:44.048 --> 12:48.177
These hands went to college.
Majored in English Lit.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.596
These are not farm hands.

12:58.479 --> 13:03.108
What? I'm part Viking. I miss my ice floe.

13:03.192 --> 13:05.361
Look to me like hot flashes.

13:08.656 --> 13:11.116
- You taking oestrogen?
- Can't.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.910
Cancer.

13:12.993 --> 13:18.165
- You?
- Shit. I tried HRT, ERT, and herbs.

13:18.249 --> 13:19.542
Mm...

13:19.625 --> 13:22.086
vodka and cigarettes,
only thing that works for me.

13:24.463 --> 13:27.758
- Fuck this. Let's light up.
- Here you go.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.386
Conrad expects us
to finish this planting today.

13:30.469 --> 13:32.471
Fuck Conrad. He in the shade.

13:33.472 --> 13:35.015
Yeah, but...

13:35.641 --> 13:38.686
You got a boyfriend, Heylia?
Husband? Lover?

13:39.812 --> 13:42.773
Is he a piece of shit, lying asshole?

13:42.856 --> 13:45.943
I had my share of them,
but I'm taking a break,

13:46.026 --> 13:47.570
maybe a lifetime break.

13:47.653 --> 13:50.698
I think I'm doomed to be alone.

13:51.407 --> 13:54.326
- Ain't no shame in it.
- But I get lonely.

13:54.785 --> 13:59.081
- Buy yourself a dog.
- No, I'm not good with animals.

13:59.164 --> 14:02.209
- Men and animals.
- Men are animals.

14:04.378 --> 14:07.840
Listen to both of you.
Two of the scariest bitches on the planet.

14:07.923 --> 14:09.216
No wonder nothing with a dick

14:09.300 --> 14:11.510
wants to come within 100 yards
of either of you.

14:11.594 --> 14:16.056
I don't see nothing that has to
stand up to pee in your life neither.

14:16.140 --> 14:18.183
So shut the fuck up, Vaneeta.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.895
Yeah, shut the fuck up, Vaneeta.

14:27.067 --> 14:31.030
"And Herod with his soldiers treated him
with contempt and mocked him.

14:31.113 --> 14:34.366
"Then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel,
he sent him back to Pilate. "

14:34.450 --> 14:39.580
Oh, for God's sake,
get to the punch line already before I die.

14:39.663 --> 14:45.252
It's no joke, Mr Mertes.
It's the crucifixion story. Luke, chapter 23.

14:45.336 --> 14:47.796
Remember?
Where we left off last week?

14:47.880 --> 14:52.551
- You read the Bible to me last week?
- Yes. I read it to you every week.

14:52.635 --> 14:55.512
OK. This weed sucks.

14:55.596 --> 14:59.516
We were low on MILF,
so we had to go to a new grower.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.477
Well, it's ditch weed drag.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.563
Don't let it happen again.
I'm on borrowed time.

15:04.647 --> 15:07.900
This is not quality.
I am so sorry, Mr Mertes.

15:07.983 --> 15:10.319
Silas, make her give me my money back.

15:10.402 --> 15:11.904
This new weed sucks.

15:11.987 --> 15:16.575
I know. Nobody wants it. I told Mom.
We'll refund you, Mr Mertes.

15:16.659 --> 15:20.037
Good. Now I got to take a whiz.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.999
If I'm not out in ten, do not resuscitate.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.547
So you're talking to me? You missed me?

15:29.630 --> 15:32.383
- You pissed me off.
- Cos you like me.

15:32.466 --> 15:36.303
- Because I like you.
- I like you, too.

15:39.139 --> 15:42.101
I'm not... good at sharing.

15:42.184 --> 15:46.522
Well, this you don't have
to share with anyone.

15:48.065 --> 15:50.276
Only for you.

15:53.571 --> 15:56.824
- A little help here!
- You should go help him.

15:56.907 --> 15:58.742
In a minute.

15:58.826 --> 16:00.286
Bad boy.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.079
- You love it.
- I do.

16:03.205 --> 16:06.292
Wait, hang on. There's more.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.881
This is inferior product.

16:11.964 --> 16:16.218
- Planning a big night on the town, are we?
- Not with this shit I'm not.

16:16.302 --> 16:20.139
You got to hook me up with better weed.
They wouldn't even buy this at the Manhole,

16:20.180 --> 16:21.765
and they smoke everything.

16:21.849 --> 16:22.892
I'm sure they do.

16:22.975 --> 16:27.521
I've got unsatisfied customers.
My reputation is suspect.

16:27.605 --> 16:29.607
That outfit is suspect.

16:30.858 --> 16:34.028
- Don't try to change the subject.
- We're out of MILF.

16:34.111 --> 16:37.573
Gonna be at least a week
before we have more.

16:37.656 --> 16:41.202
Well, hurry up, OK?
Clinique is putting the screws to me.

16:41.285 --> 16:44.413
We're having a sonogram tomorrow,
and those things aren't cheap.

16:44.496 --> 16:50.169
- Do you think you're ready to be a father?
- Do I look like I am ready to be a father?!

16:57.468 --> 16:58.761
Terrific.

17:02.014 --> 17:04.934
I'm always curious
about my customer's choices.

17:06.435 --> 17:09.355
Yeah. I think this one chose me.

17:09.939 --> 17:11.397
Care to elaborate?

17:11.482 --> 17:15.611
It just reminds me that "thug" means
never having to say you're sorry.

17:16.612 --> 17:18.696
- Don't you mean love?
- Absolutely not.

17:18.781 --> 17:20.366
Ahh.

17:20.449 --> 17:22.701
Love means you're constantly apologising.

17:24.537 --> 17:26.497
Tell me about it.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.667
I should get "I'm sorry, baby"
tattooed on my ass.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.001
Why don't you?

17:31.043 --> 17:33.837
I already got a giant eagle
chained to a rock there.

17:35.297 --> 17:39.593
- Looking good. Wanna take a look?
- Yeah.

17:43.138 --> 17:45.975
- Came out nice.
- Yeah.

17:47.351 --> 17:49.436
You have something for me?

17:50.771 --> 17:52.356
Ohh.

17:52.439 --> 17:57.611
Thank you, Pot Mommy. And here you go.

17:57.695 --> 18:00.781
Erm, I don't think our business
arrangement's gonna work out.

18:01.532 --> 18:02.867
And why's that?

18:02.950 --> 18:05.411
My customers
don't seem to like your product.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.372
Wait. My shit is good.

18:08.455 --> 18:12.459
Oh, no. Don't take it personally.
You grow Merlot, they prefer Cabernet.

18:12.543 --> 18:14.128
Your customers sound gay.

18:14.211 --> 18:17.464
Some of them are.
Most of them just don't like your weed.

18:18.382 --> 18:21.886
Here's for the pound
you loaned me on consignment.

18:23.012 --> 18:24.847
Good faith.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.600
I wish you luck in all future endeavours.

18:28.475 --> 18:33.898
So, see you around. Wear a helmet.
Follow safety laws.

18:33.981 --> 18:37.735
Wait, wait, wait. I'm disappointed.

18:37.776 --> 18:41.947
Are you absolutely sure
that we can't do business, huh?

18:41.989 --> 18:44.366
- I am.
- That's a shame.

18:45.951 --> 18:48.787
But just to show you
that there's no hard feelings,

18:48.871 --> 18:52.416
I'd like to take you to dinner.
Give you a chance to get to know me.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.585
I don't mix the business with the personal.

18:54.668 --> 18:57.213
According to you,
we're not doing the business any more.

18:57.296 --> 19:01.300
- We're not doing the personal, either.
- Tell you what, you think about it.

19:01.383 --> 19:04.678
You weigh the pros and the cons,
and I'll be in touch.

19:04.762 --> 19:08.224
Touch yourself, Chester. I gotta go.

19:08.307 --> 19:09.892
Bye.

19:11.936 --> 19:13.020
Girl's got balls.

19:14.438 --> 19:15.940
Yeah, she does.

19:17.066 --> 19:20.152
But who wants a chick with fuckin' balls?

19:30.746 --> 19:32.373
Jesus, Doug.

19:55.145 --> 19:56.772
"Whore. "

19:56.855 --> 19:58.774
Hello to you, too.

19:58.857 --> 20:01.193
I've been doing a little light reading.

20:02.236 --> 20:06.156
Hell did that cross get in there?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.075
How the fuck?

20:08.158 --> 20:12.246
Doug snuck it in on Sanjay's shift,
wired it, the whole thing.

20:14.123 --> 20:17.585
Mangoes, apricots.

20:17.668 --> 20:19.587
Nice supermarkets y'all got.

20:19.670 --> 20:22.965
Yes. We blow a loud horn of plenty out here.

20:27.553 --> 20:30.556
- That kind of day?
- Only kind I know.

20:33.517 --> 20:34.810
What the fuck...

20:37.104 --> 20:38.731
Oh, yeah.

20:40.399 --> 20:42.693
Please tell me
you have a thing for traffic signs.

20:42.776 --> 20:45.362
I got a thing for these figs.
They're delicious.

20:45.446 --> 20:47.198
You fucked him?

20:47.281 --> 20:49.325
That's none of your business.

20:49.366 --> 20:51.410
OK. Get the fuck outta here.

20:51.493 --> 20:54.330
What, you think you're the first
black man I've been with?

20:54.413 --> 20:56.081
- I'm not?
- You know he's called U-Turn?

20:56.165 --> 20:58.876
- OK, now you're just obscene.
- Come on.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.502
I never slept with U-Turn.

21:01.587 --> 21:02.880
Just gave him a hand job.

21:03.923 --> 21:06.675
- OK, so now you're fucking with me.
- You think?

21:06.759 --> 21:08.719
Do I believe you?

21:08.802 --> 21:11.138
You'd better if you want to get lucky tonight.

21:14.475 --> 21:17.144
- Why would you do that?
- Mess with you or get the tattoo?

21:17.228 --> 21:18.395
The fucking tattoo.

21:20.356 --> 21:22.233
I thought it would make me stronger.

21:23.776 --> 21:25.486
Question is...

21:26.237 --> 21:30.032
you got a thing for women
who got a thing for traffic signs?

21:30.115 --> 21:32.326
That motherfucker caused us nothing but pain.

21:32.409 --> 21:34.870
Motherfucker's dead. We're alive.

21:36.705 --> 21:40.000
- That's true.
- Now shut up and taste this.

21:46.131 --> 21:50.386
What city has 720 bridges
and 15 in its downtown alone?

21:50.469 --> 21:52.721
- I'm gonna guess, Pittsburgh.
- Correct.

21:52.763 --> 21:55.599
- And what city has the first robotics institute?
- Nance?

21:55.683 --> 21:57.309
Pittsburgh.

21:57.393 --> 22:00.771
Carnegie Mellon University.
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Correct.

22:00.854 --> 22:03.274
- Where was the first Big Mac sold?
- Pittsburgh.

22:03.357 --> 22:05.568
- The first World Series?
- Uh-hurgh.

22:05.651 --> 22:08.362
- The first aluminium building?
- Silas?

22:08.404 --> 22:12.283
- Wrong. Pittsburgh.
- My God. What happened to you?

22:12.366 --> 22:14.410
I was driving home. Stopped at a light.

22:14.493 --> 22:15.494
- Ow, ow!
- Sorry...

22:15.578 --> 22:16.912
Go get a rag.

22:16.996 --> 22:18.455
- I stopped at a light.
- I heard.

22:18.539 --> 22:21.000
And what happened? Look at you.

22:21.083 --> 22:24.086
Three... Three guys on motorcycles
pulled me out of the car.

22:24.169 --> 22:26.338
How many motorcycles in Pittsburgh?

22:26.422 --> 22:30.134
They said they're coming after you.
They're coming after all of us.

22:30.217 --> 22:31.677
I don't know. I need to look it up.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.054
You need a doctor. Come on.
We're going to a doctor.

22:35.973 --> 22:37.266
Jesus Christ, Shane!

22:37.349 --> 22:41.645
There are many safe, ethnically diverse
neighbourhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

22:41.770 --> 22:45.482
I'm glad you asked. There's Allentown,
Arlington, Arlington Heights,

22:45.566 --> 22:48.736

Spring Hill, Squirrel Hill,
St Clair, Summer Hill, Windgap.

22:59.830 --> 23:04.168
- I can also do them backwards.
- Shane, who are you talking to?

23:05.169 --> 23:06.837
Dad.

23:10.007 --> 23:14.511
Can too! Windgap, Summer Hill, St Clair,

23:32.780 --> 23:34.615
<i># The lights go on</i>

23:34.698 --> 23:37.409
<i># The lights go off</i>

23:38.536 --> 23:44.124
<i># When things don't feel right</i>

23:44.208 --> 23:49.630
<i># When I feel alive</i>

23:49.713 --> 23:55.135
<i># I try to imagine a careless life</i>

23:55.219 --> 24:02.268
<i># A scenic world where the sunsets are all</i>

24:02.351 --> 24:05.646
