WEBVTT

00:03.782 --> 00:05.347
All right,
pay attention.

00:05.391 --> 00:07.130
I'm watching, Dad.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.956
Elbows in,
mop close to your body.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.304
You seeing this?

00:11.347 --> 00:12.869
Yeah, Dad, I see it.

00:12.913 --> 00:16.130
Pretty impressive guns
for an old guy.[chuckles]

00:16.173 --> 00:17.347
Yes, they are.

00:17.391 --> 00:18.521
Effort comes
from the arms.

00:18.565 --> 00:21.043
Otherwise,
ten floors later,

00:21.086 --> 00:23.304
your back is aching
like there's no tomorrow.

00:23.347 --> 00:26.347
[chuckles]
All right.[sighs deeply]

00:26.391 --> 00:29.347
Your turn.Dad, you know
I'm only gonna be doing this

00:29.391 --> 00:32.304
till I get through school.People call this
blue-collar.

00:32.347 --> 00:34.304
I don't care
what color your shirt is.

00:34.347 --> 00:37.000
You bring pride to the job,
people notice.

00:37.043 --> 00:40.434
Even if they don't, you notice.

00:40.478 --> 00:43.869
Hmm?Yes, sir.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.652
[grunting]Elbows. Them elbows.
Them elbows.

00:45.695 --> 00:48.565
I see where the guns
come from... God...[chuckles]

00:48.608 --> 00:51.217
[crash, clattering in distance;
man grunts]

00:51.260 --> 00:53.043
Back office. Lock the door.
Call Security.

00:53.086 --> 00:55.173
Dad, w...Do it!

01:00.304 --> 01:02.304
[door shuts]

01:02.347 --> 01:04.608
Lieutenant Pine.

01:04.652 --> 01:06.000
You okay?

01:13.086 --> 01:14.956
Oh, my God.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.565
Lieutenant Pine?

01:48.304 --> 01:49.956
Look out!

01:50.000 --> 01:50.652
Coming at ya!

01:51.434 --> 01:53.391
My squad room brethren.

01:53.434 --> 01:57.347
Don't interrupt me. I'm filing,
and then I am out of here.

01:57.391 --> 02:00.304
Wow, you are working
that filing cabinet.

02:00.347 --> 02:01.913
It's gonna be the first night
in two weeks

02:01.956 --> 02:03.695
I get out of here
before midnight.

02:03.739 --> 02:07.347
Well, when you don't do your
paperwork, it starts to pile up,

02:07.391 --> 02:09.391
and then you're stuck
staying late.

02:09.434 --> 02:10.826
Thanks for that, mother hen.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.869
But not even you
chattering away like Edith

02:12.913 --> 02:14.869
on All in the Familyis gonna
get me down tonight.

02:14.913 --> 02:16.260
You got plans?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.043
Tonight, Ms. Zoe Keates

02:18.086 --> 02:20.304
is teaching me
how to make bread.

02:20.347 --> 02:21.434
BISHOP: Is that
some kind of...

02:21.478 --> 02:22.304
euphemism?

02:22.347 --> 02:23.739
Possibly.

02:23.782 --> 02:26.217
But either way, she's gonna
bring the ingredients,

02:26.260 --> 02:29.043
and we're gonna do the kneading.

02:29.086 --> 02:30.434
Look at me, guys.

02:30.478 --> 02:32.304
I am doing paperwork,
then

02:32.347 --> 02:36.304
I'm gonna go make some bread
with a girl that makes me smile.

02:36.347 --> 02:37.869
I'm evolving.

02:37.913 --> 02:40.043
Put it on hold, DiNozzo.But...

02:40.086 --> 02:43.304
we're gonna do the kneading.We got a dead Navy lieutenant
at the DLA.

02:44.434 --> 02:45.695
Defense Logistics Agency?

02:45.739 --> 02:46.956
That's the one.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.478
TONY:
Hey... listen...

02:48.521 --> 02:51.434
Operation Sourdough's a no-go.

02:53.565 --> 02:55.913
Victim is
Lieutenant Dominic Pine,

02:55.956 --> 02:58.956
28 years old, worked here at
the DLA for the past two years.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.956
Doing what?Worked as an aide to Vice
Admiral Janet Kleibor.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.217
This is her office.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.739
Better notify her.Tried.

03:06.782 --> 03:08.869
We, uh, called her cell.
No answer.

03:08.913 --> 03:10.782
So we've got an agent on
the way to her house.

03:10.826 --> 03:13.260
Well, DLA police were first
on the scene.

03:13.304 --> 03:16.043
When they got here, the attacker
was gone and Pine was dead.

03:16.086 --> 03:17.521
Witnesses?Janitor

03:17.565 --> 03:18.869
and his son.

03:18.913 --> 03:20.826
Janitor heard the crash.

03:20.869 --> 03:22.913
Told his son
to call Security.

03:22.956 --> 03:25.956
And the boy saw a blue sedan
leaving out the back window.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.478
Gave us a partial plate.

03:27.521 --> 03:28.869
Let's get a BOLO out.

03:28.913 --> 03:32.130
You can set your minds
to rest, dear friends.

03:32.173 --> 03:33.869
Baby Victoria is fine.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.956
I spoke with
Mr. Palmer,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.217
and together we diagnosed her
with a low-grade fever.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.956
First thing in the morning,

03:41.000 --> 03:42.956
she's gonna visit
with her pediatrician.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.043
I didn't know she was sick.

03:44.086 --> 03:45.130
I thought I told you.

03:45.173 --> 03:48.000
Oh, forgive me,
Jethro.

03:48.043 --> 03:52.043
My mind has been scattered
with grandfatherly worries.

03:52.086 --> 03:54.913
Grandfather?Mr. Palmer
has declared

03:54.956 --> 03:56.869
when the child is
of speaking age,

03:56.913 --> 03:59.956
she will call me Grand-Ducky.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.565
[chuckles]

04:02.608 --> 04:04.826
But to the matter in hand.

04:04.869 --> 04:08.521
Ah. Ah. Blunt force trauma.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.956
Yeah, this man has been hit
on the head

04:11.000 --> 04:13.173
with some sort of weapon
and then fell

04:13.217 --> 04:15.869
on what used
to be a coffee table.

04:15.913 --> 04:17.956
McGEE:
Computer hasn't been
touched in five days.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.956
Whoever did this wasn't
after anything digital.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.956
No sign
of a robbery either.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.086
Perhaps his death
was the endgame.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.826
[Bishop grunting]

04:25.869 --> 04:27.478
[grunts]GIBBS:
Bishop...

04:27.521 --> 04:28.521
what are you doing?

04:29.869 --> 04:30.826
Rule 20:

04:30.869 --> 04:31.913
"Always look under."

04:31.956 --> 04:32.913
TONY:
Rule 20.

04:32.956 --> 04:34.869
Rarely quoted,
widely interpreted.

04:36.217 --> 04:38.000
Could've slipped out
of the lieutenant's hand

04:38.043 --> 04:39.347
when he was hit.

04:42.043 --> 04:44.217
McGEE:
A pen?

04:45.130 --> 04:47.000
Standard gift for fancy people.

04:47.043 --> 04:48.043
Bag it. Let's go.

04:48.086 --> 04:50.000
Finish processing.
Get some answers.

04:50.043 --> 04:52.086
DiNozzo.Yeah, boss.

04:52.130 --> 04:53.826
You worked late
for two straight weeks.

04:53.869 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, boss.Backlogged paperwork's
your own fault.

04:56.043 --> 04:57.043
Yeah, boss.

04:57.086 --> 04:58.652
Go home, evolve,

04:58.695 --> 05:00.434
start fresh in the morning.

05:00.478 --> 05:03.434
Thank you, boss. Duckman,

05:03.478 --> 05:06.043
I'm gonna be making
some bread tonight.

05:06.086 --> 05:08.913
Zoe, we're on.

05:08.956 --> 05:11.000
I'll preheat the oven.

05:11.043 --> 05:14.782
Yeah... well,
that's like a phyllo pastry.

05:14.826 --> 05:16.478
I think, right?

05:16.521 --> 05:18.739
Look, croissant, baguette,

05:18.782 --> 05:21.521
whatever it is, it's all the
same to me, baby-- it's bread.

05:21.565 --> 05:24.434
That's...

05:26.695 --> 05:27.739
Dad!

05:27.782 --> 05:29.173
[blues music
playing on sound system]

05:29.217 --> 05:30.173
What are you doing here?

05:30.217 --> 05:32.043
Building manager let me in.

05:33.739 --> 05:35.608
Don't worry.
I didn't sleep with her.

05:35.652 --> 05:37.217
[blues continues playing]

05:37.260 --> 05:38.913
Are you listening
to my breakup mix?

05:38.956 --> 05:40.434
Since you're my best man,

05:40.478 --> 05:42.478
I wanted you
to be the first to know...

05:44.869 --> 05:46.391
She left me, Junior.

05:46.434 --> 05:49.434
The wedding's
been called off.

05:50.478 --> 05:53.086
Linda left me.

05:53.130 --> 05:54.826
Oh, boy.

05:54.869 --> 05:58.913
Zoe, we're gonna have
to reschedule the bread.

06:04.173 --> 06:06.130
Yeah, Senior was so broken up
over Linda,

06:06.173 --> 06:07.913
he forgot his cell phone
at home.

06:07.956 --> 06:09.608
So he didn't tell
Tony he was coming?

06:09.652 --> 06:12.434
No, he did not.

06:12.478 --> 06:14.217
And it all happened
on the first night

06:14.260 --> 06:17.739
in recorded history that Gibbs
gave me the early release.

06:17.782 --> 06:19.086
So why did Linda
leave him?

06:19.130 --> 06:21.173
She probably got clued in
to his line of work.

06:21.217 --> 06:23.000
I thought he was
a businessman.

06:23.043 --> 06:25.043
[scoffs]McGEE:
Well, he's-he's...

06:25.086 --> 06:26.652
he calls himself
an entrepreneur,

06:26.695 --> 06:28.652
but he's kind of more
like a headhunter

06:28.695 --> 06:32.434
that finds rich people by...

06:32.478 --> 06:33.739
It's okay, Tim.

06:33.782 --> 06:34.782
You can say it.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.391
My dad is a con man.

06:36.434 --> 06:37.782
What?!

06:37.826 --> 06:38.826
But he's so...

06:38.869 --> 06:39.826
Handsome?

06:39.869 --> 06:40.608
Charismatic?

06:40.652 --> 06:42.391
Right-place, right-time?

06:42.434 --> 06:43.739
Exactly.

06:43.782 --> 06:45.086
What are you gonna do?

06:45.130 --> 06:47.608
I don't know. I mean...

06:47.652 --> 06:49.086
I've never quite seen him
like this.

06:49.130 --> 06:50.782
He won't get out of his pajamas.
Granted,

06:50.826 --> 06:53.913
they're 100% silk-- very nice--
but still...

06:53.956 --> 06:56.086
You know, maybe you should
give him an activity.

06:56.130 --> 06:58.086
You know, occupy his mind,
pretend like nothing's wrong.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.173
Like what you do for Tony
when he's depressed.

07:00.217 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.043 --> 07:02.260
You do?

07:02.304 --> 07:04.173
Oh, yeah.

07:04.217 --> 07:05.826
When Ziva stayed
in Israel...

07:05.869 --> 07:08.217
Oh, yeah. You asked me to...

07:08.260 --> 07:10.826
help you replace that
Tronwallpaper in your bedroom

07:10.869 --> 07:12.826
with the new Star Warsstuff.

07:12.869 --> 07:13.652
Worked like a charm.

07:13.695 --> 07:15.260
Update. Let's go.

07:17.434 --> 07:21.913
Uh... our victim is
Navy Lieutenant Dominic Pine.

07:21.956 --> 07:24.956
Witness saw a blue sedan
leaving the scene,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.695
gave us a partial plate;
BOLO is out wide.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.173
McGEE: Whoever was
driving that car

07:29.217 --> 07:31.347
had a radio-frequency
key card

07:31.391 --> 07:34.565
that was reprogrammed to
override the DLA's gate system.

07:34.608 --> 07:36.434
Card had an embedded
Trojan horse

07:36.478 --> 07:37.869
that disabled
security cameras.

07:37.913 --> 07:40.826
Yeah, breach happened four
minutes before Pine arrived,

07:40.869 --> 07:42.086
so the killer must've been
waiting for him.

07:42.130 --> 07:43.565
BISHOP:
Uh, motive could be tied

07:43.608 --> 07:44.956
to sensitive
information.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.521
As Admiral Kleibor's aide,

07:46.565 --> 07:48.217
Pine knew about
the movement

07:48.260 --> 07:50.043
of supplies to
Navy warships.

07:50.086 --> 07:52.782
The admiral?McGEE: Finally got word
to her last night.

07:52.826 --> 07:55.130
She is on the USS Madison.

07:55.173 --> 07:58.826
Ship is in port at Naval
Station Mayport in Florida.

07:58.869 --> 08:02.304
She'll be calling in shortly.BISHOP: As far as
Lieutenant Pine's enemies go,

08:02.347 --> 08:03.434
we couldn't find any.

08:03.478 --> 08:05.043
Girlfriend is Gloria Hernandez.

08:05.086 --> 08:06.739
She's waiting
in the conference room.

08:06.782 --> 08:08.608
McGee, Bishop, go. DiNozzo...

08:08.652 --> 08:10.434
I want the admiral
when she calls in.

08:10.478 --> 08:12.086
Okay. Have fun, guys.

08:12.130 --> 08:13.739
[phone rings]

08:13.782 --> 08:15.608
Please don't be Dad.

08:15.652 --> 08:17.652
Dad.

08:17.695 --> 08:18.739
[ringing stops]

08:20.173 --> 08:21.695
[sighing]:
Dad, how are you feeling?

08:21.739 --> 08:23.304
Hello, son.

08:23.347 --> 08:24.826
I was wondering
if you could, uh,

08:24.869 --> 08:26.086
swing by here
on your lunch break

08:26.130 --> 08:28.434
and-and bring me something.

08:28.478 --> 08:30.739
[chuckles]
We don't really take
lunch breaks here.

08:30.782 --> 08:33.391
Isn't that illegal?[Tony chuckles]

08:33.434 --> 08:34.739
So what do you want, Dad?

08:34.782 --> 08:36.434
I need some nice paper.

08:36.478 --> 08:37.913
I want to write a letter
to Linda begging her

08:37.956 --> 08:39.608
to come back to me, and...

08:39.652 --> 08:42.913
I thought it should be on some
classy paper. What do you think?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.043
Give him an activity.

08:44.782 --> 08:46.043
McGee does it for you.

08:46.086 --> 08:47.739
Junior, you there?

08:47.782 --> 08:50.217
Hey, Dad, listen, we'll work
on that paper thing,

08:50.260 --> 08:52.391
but I really need you
to do something for me.

08:52.434 --> 08:53.869
You do?Yeah.

08:53.913 --> 08:56.000
I need you to re-caulk my tub.

08:56.043 --> 08:58.478
You mean
like a handyman kind of thing?

08:58.521 --> 09:00.391
Yeah, yeah,
that's it.

09:00.434 --> 09:03.260
Um, sort of an emergency.
I heard about it on the news.

09:03.304 --> 09:06.043
There's a recall
on the caulk I used.

09:06.086 --> 09:08.173
You're kidding.No. No.

09:08.217 --> 09:09.695
It causes athlete's foot.

09:09.739 --> 09:12.391
Nasty.
And I... I know you got

09:12.434 --> 09:15.043
a lot on your mind, but...No, that's all right. Uh...

09:15.086 --> 09:16.913
I'll be fine. I-I can handle it.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.260
Oh. Well, thanks a million, Dad.

09:19.304 --> 09:20.869
See you, son.

09:23.434 --> 09:25.086
Works like a charm.

09:25.130 --> 09:26.695
Huh.

09:26.739 --> 09:30.173
I was in foster care
my whole life.

09:30.217 --> 09:33.043
Dominic didn't have
any family, either.

09:33.086 --> 09:35.043
But when we met,

09:35.086 --> 09:39.304
it was like this emptiness
was suddenly full.

09:41.869 --> 09:43.826
How long have you been together?

09:43.869 --> 09:46.391
Four months.

09:46.434 --> 09:48.956
But I knew the first day
he was the one.

09:50.869 --> 09:52.521
Do you know who did this to him?

09:52.565 --> 09:54.695
Not yet.

09:56.652 --> 09:58.695
Gloria,
was there anything unusual

09:58.739 --> 10:00.434
about his behavior lately?

10:00.478 --> 10:03.739
I think something might've been
going on at work,

10:03.782 --> 10:06.217
but he didn't like
to talk about it.

10:06.260 --> 10:08.304
Well, we'll update you
as soon as we have something,

10:08.347 --> 10:09.695
Ms. Hernandez.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.652
I know what happens
to people like Dominic.

10:12.695 --> 10:16.695
They fall
through the cracks

10:16.739 --> 10:19.000
because there's no family
fighting for them.

10:19.043 --> 10:20.913
Well, I'm here.

10:20.956 --> 10:22.826
I'm fighting for Dominic.

10:24.913 --> 10:27.391
So are we.

10:27.434 --> 10:29.391
Gentlemen, where are you
in your investigation?

10:29.434 --> 10:30.913
At the beginning, Admiral.

10:30.956 --> 10:32.608
We're hoping
you can move us along.

10:32.652 --> 10:34.391
Pine was killed
in your office.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.391
I'm here congratulating a friend

10:37.434 --> 10:39.608
on the commissioning
of the Madison.

10:39.652 --> 10:41.260
I forgot his gift in my office.

10:41.304 --> 10:42.608
The pen.

10:42.652 --> 10:45.608
Yes. I asked the lieutenant
to pick it up

10:45.652 --> 10:49.391
before he was to join us onboard
this morning.

10:49.434 --> 10:52.956
He's dead because of me.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.260
He was in that office...

10:55.304 --> 10:57.521
because of me.

11:03.391 --> 11:05.739
Abb?

11:06.565 --> 11:07.652
What are you doing?

11:07.695 --> 11:08.956
Didn't you hear?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.347
Tony's dad got dumped.

11:12.391 --> 11:14.608
And since he won't
get out of his pajamas,

11:14.652 --> 11:17.869
I dug up my old sewing machine
to make him another pair.

11:17.913 --> 11:21.086
So at least he has...

11:21.130 --> 11:23.913
an alternate.

11:23.956 --> 11:26.521
You dig up anything else?I did.

11:26.565 --> 11:28.913
So if you look
at the crime scene photos,

11:28.956 --> 11:32.782
they tell a
pretty clear story.

11:32.826 --> 11:36.565
Once upon a time,
Lieutenant Pine

11:36.608 --> 11:38.695
got hit on the head, his blood
spattered on the wall,

11:38.739 --> 11:40.347
he crashed
through a coffee table

11:40.391 --> 11:42.304
and he lay on the
floor, dead. The end.

11:42.347 --> 11:44.304
Not great for bedtime.Believe it or not,

11:44.347 --> 11:47.391
the most twisted thing about
this story is this painting.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.521
It's called The Chesapeake,

11:49.565 --> 11:51.130
and it's been hung on many

11:51.173 --> 11:53.565
impressive walls
over the last 50 years.

11:53.608 --> 11:55.043
Right now it's
on loan to the admiral

11:55.086 --> 11:57.173
from the Navy's
art collection.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.043
And?And look at the blood spatter.

12:01.739 --> 12:02.739
Stopped short of the painting.

12:02.782 --> 12:05.043
Yeah. Based on the pattern,

12:05.086 --> 12:06.826
the blood should've
at least reached

12:06.869 --> 12:08.739
this frame,
but there's nothing here.

12:08.782 --> 12:10.652
And P.S., this painting

12:10.695 --> 12:12.869
is supposed to be from 1962.

12:12.913 --> 12:15.347
The paint isn't nearly that old.

12:15.391 --> 12:16.652
P.P.S.,

12:16.695 --> 12:19.782
this gallery tag
is aged with tea.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.043
Gibbs, this painting is a fake

12:22.086 --> 12:23.608
and it was hung on the wall

12:23.652 --> 12:25.478
after Lieutenant Pine
was killed.

12:25.521 --> 12:27.347
Killer was there
to steal the original.

12:27.391 --> 12:29.434
Which is exactly what he did.

12:29.478 --> 12:31.608
Well, that's great work, Abbs.
Hey, why don't you make up

12:31.652 --> 12:33.782
a pair of those pants
for the Grand-Duck?

12:33.826 --> 12:36.391
That's a good idea.

12:36.434 --> 12:39.173
McGEE:
Working theory is the thief
broke in to steal the painting.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.434
He thought the place would
be empty, but Lieutenant Pine

12:41.478 --> 12:43.478
showed up to pick up a gift
for the admiral.

12:43.521 --> 12:44.739
Pine wasn't the target.

12:44.782 --> 12:46.782
Wrong place,
wrong time.

12:46.826 --> 12:47.869
Junior?

12:49.086 --> 12:50.782
Dad.

12:50.826 --> 12:54.347
I feel horrible that you good
people have to see me like this,

12:54.391 --> 12:56.739
but you know what a jackass
love can be.

12:56.782 --> 13:00.347
Uh-huh.I'm really sorry
about Linda, Mr. DiNozzo.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.565
Oh, no. Excuse us.
Dad, hey,

13:03.608 --> 13:05.347
Dad, um...

13:05.391 --> 13:06.652
You still wearing
your pajamas?

13:07.782 --> 13:09.173
What are you doing here?

13:09.217 --> 13:11.826
I came to tell you
that the tub is fine.

13:11.869 --> 13:13.913
Oh, you fixed the tub?

13:13.956 --> 13:17.130
No, I hired a young kid
from the hardware store

13:17.173 --> 13:20.739
with the emergency cash you keep
in your moisturizer drawer.

13:22.391 --> 13:24.391
Moisturizer drawer...?!

13:24.434 --> 13:25.478
Okay, well, that's great.

13:25.521 --> 13:27.000
Good job.

13:27.043 --> 13:29.434
Um, what we're gonna do now
is I'm gonna call you a cab,

13:29.478 --> 13:31.608
and we'll get you
back to the apartment.Oh, no, no, no, listen...

13:31.652 --> 13:33.173
the truth is, Junior,

13:33.217 --> 13:36.260
I was feeling better when
I was doing that caulk thing.

13:36.304 --> 13:39.608
But then when Javier left,
I realized

13:39.652 --> 13:41.521
[whispers]:
I didn't want to be alone.

13:41.565 --> 13:43.739
Dad...

13:45.956 --> 13:48.000
SENIOR:
Huh...

13:48.043 --> 13:50.826
that's a Cantor Howell,
isn't it?

13:50.869 --> 13:53.521
Yeah. Yes, uh, it's called
The Chesapeake.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.913
Photo was taken to document it
for the Navy's collection.

13:55.956 --> 13:58.782
Howell did slices
of American history.

13:58.826 --> 14:01.608
Yeah, last year, there was a
profile on him in Viewmagazine.

14:01.652 --> 14:03.478
Made his paintings
spike in value.

14:03.521 --> 14:05.695
Enough to make this one
worth stealing.

14:05.739 --> 14:08.739
You know, when I did my
European wingding of '86,

14:08.782 --> 14:10.652
I had a healthy
peek at the

14:10.695 --> 14:12.130
underground art world.

14:12.173 --> 14:13.608
Oh, I'm sure you did.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.086
Uh... I...

14:15.130 --> 14:17.000
I could give you a tutorial,
if you'd like.

14:17.043 --> 14:19.739
No, no, no, we're all set
here, Dad-- we got work to do.

14:19.782 --> 14:21.608
Say good-bye, Dad! Dad!

14:21.652 --> 14:24.608
SENIOR: Well, Junior, I don't
really want to go back
in the apartment...

14:24.652 --> 14:25.608
DiNozzo.

14:25.652 --> 14:27.695
BOTH:
Yeah?

14:27.739 --> 14:29.608
Tutorial couldn't hurt.

14:29.652 --> 14:31.565
Oh.

14:31.608 --> 14:33.347
[sighs]

14:38.347 --> 14:41.304
Black market art
is a small world.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.956
All the players know each other,
even across the ocean.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.173
All we need
is a single line to get inside.

14:49.130 --> 14:51.043
Hey, Junior.

14:51.086 --> 14:52.130
You're late. Sit down.

14:55.043 --> 14:57.086
How'd you get
your suit back?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.869
There's a gung ho
messenger named Todd

14:58.913 --> 15:00.521
who works in the building.

15:00.565 --> 15:02.260
I know Todd.
That's my stapler,

15:02.304 --> 15:04.347
pencil holder
and desk lamp.Mr. DiNozzo,

15:04.391 --> 15:05.478
who do these guys sell to?

15:05.521 --> 15:08.086
Anyone who has money.

15:08.130 --> 15:10.260
BISHOP: Yeah.
A good thief quietly puts

15:10.304 --> 15:12.782
the word out to the community
that he's acquired a piece.

15:12.826 --> 15:15.478
That way he's able
to find the buyer who's
willing to pay the most.

15:15.521 --> 15:17.652
She's sharp and
she's beautiful.

15:17.695 --> 15:20.913
GIBBS:
So what we do is we step in,
we offer the thief

15:20.956 --> 15:22.652
a better price than
the one he's already got.

15:22.695 --> 15:25.478
Bingo, boss.TONY: Okay, this all
sounds terrific,

15:25.521 --> 15:28.391
but how do we make an offer
to a guy if we don't know
who that guy is?

15:28.434 --> 15:30.956
If you'd have been here on time,
Junior, you'd know.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.086
Feelers.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.434
Feelers?McGEE: Yes, feelers.

15:33.478 --> 15:34.652
Your father

15:34.695 --> 15:36.130
put out feelers
in his network,

15:36.173 --> 15:38.217
saying he heard The Chesapeake
might be available

15:38.260 --> 15:40.086
and that he's highly
interested in buying it.

15:40.130 --> 15:43.391
Son, uh, your art thief
is gonna come to your papa.

15:43.434 --> 15:45.043
"Come to your papa"?
What does that even mean?

15:45.086 --> 15:46.434
Let's get it done.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.782
Hey, hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:48.826 --> 15:51.304
What's happening?Gibbs already divvied up
the work. You were late.

15:51.347 --> 15:53.826
I was preparing his ride
for when this is over.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.173
The cab was two feet
from the door.

15:55.217 --> 15:56.565
He doesn't need a cab;
he's with me.

15:56.608 --> 15:59.000
What?!He's got an
art forger friend in DC.

15:59.043 --> 16:01.565
We're gonna show him the fake,
see if he can tell us
anything about it.

16:01.608 --> 16:04.000
Tony, black market art

16:04.043 --> 16:05.695
is a small world.[pats shoulder]

16:07.608 --> 16:09.608
[sighs, mutters]

16:12.130 --> 16:16.173
DUCKY: The USS Chesapeake
was launched in 1799

16:16.217 --> 16:18.217
as one of the
original frigates

16:18.260 --> 16:20.260
of the United States Navy.

16:20.304 --> 16:21.826
What do you see, Duck?

16:21.869 --> 16:24.173
Well, the true value of art.

16:24.217 --> 16:28.304
Our forefathers built that ship
to protect a new nation.

16:28.347 --> 16:31.652
Cantor Howell was inspired
by that resolve to create

16:31.695 --> 16:35.217
this painting and now we
stand here, looking at his work

16:35.260 --> 16:37.260
and feel a sense of...Pride.

16:37.304 --> 16:39.086
Yeah.Yeah.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.304
The lieutenant?

16:41.347 --> 16:43.826
Yes, well, as I surmised,

16:43.869 --> 16:46.086
cause of death was
blunt force trauma.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.652
But take a look at this
lower part of the wound.It's curved.

16:49.695 --> 16:53.260
Which suggests a murder
weapon with a rounded edge.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.304
That it?Well, for the present, yes.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.478
But Lieutenant Pine's
past had something to say.

16:58.521 --> 17:00.304
This is his left knee.

17:00.347 --> 17:03.130
Had a pin in it.Uh, two, actually.

17:03.173 --> 17:05.000
Yes, apparently
he received

17:05.043 --> 17:07.652
a waiver to enter
officer training and-and

17:07.695 --> 17:09.086
these records show

17:09.130 --> 17:11.478
that he was in a serious
car accident as a boy.

17:11.521 --> 17:14.217
Lost both parents
and his sister.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.608
That's why he had no family.

17:15.652 --> 17:18.434
Yes, but Lieutenant Pine
rose above his wounds,

17:18.478 --> 17:20.739
both physically
and emotionally,

17:20.782 --> 17:23.956
to become an
extraordinary young man.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.173
And now he's
no longer with us

17:26.217 --> 17:28.260
because someone took
a look at that painting

17:28.304 --> 17:32.304
and saw only dollar signs.

17:42.652 --> 17:45.478
So, uh, where is he?

17:45.521 --> 17:48.043
Oh, he likes
to make an entrance.

17:48.086 --> 17:51.217
And by the way, he doesn't
like cops, for obvious reasons.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.304
I'll say you're my son.

17:55.043 --> 17:57.173
Doesn't he know your son's
a federal agent?

17:57.217 --> 18:00.304
None of my associates know
that-- it makes them uneasy.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.695
I tell them that Junior's
a catalog model.

18:02.739 --> 18:05.086
Anthony!

18:05.130 --> 18:06.304
Ah, Perry.

18:06.347 --> 18:08.565
This is great.
I can't believe this.

18:08.608 --> 18:10.826
Perry Swann.
You're looking great.

18:10.869 --> 18:12.347
Come here.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.086
Good to see you.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.739
Meet my son.

18:15.782 --> 18:16.913
No.

18:16.956 --> 18:19.086
Tony, the famous
catalog model?

18:19.130 --> 18:20.521
That's me.

18:20.565 --> 18:23.043
Well, he... he has
your chiseled features.

18:24.217 --> 18:25.956
How about a pose?

18:27.347 --> 18:29.260
I'm sorry?I'm a painter.

18:29.304 --> 18:31.782
I'm always looking
for a solid pose.

18:31.826 --> 18:33.260
Inspiration,
you know.

18:33.304 --> 18:34.739
Don't be shy
about your talent, son.

18:34.782 --> 18:36.173
Go ahead. Pose.

18:44.521 --> 18:46.086
Powerful.

18:46.130 --> 18:49.826
Anthony, it really
is terrific to see you.

18:49.869 --> 18:51.565
I don't get many
visitors these days.

18:51.608 --> 18:52.782
What are you
talking about?

18:52.826 --> 18:54.347
This place has seen
more soirees

18:54.391 --> 18:56.869
than that barn
we renovated in Brussels.

18:56.913 --> 19:00.043
Yes, but then, one day,
the phone goes quiet,

19:00.086 --> 19:03.173
and all you have left
is the work that you
worked so hard on.

19:03.217 --> 19:07.043
Turns out it's just
a pile of fake Monets.

19:07.086 --> 19:08.608
Yeah.Mm.

19:10.130 --> 19:13.130
Mr. Swann, uh, can you

19:13.173 --> 19:16.826
tell us anything
about this painting?

19:18.217 --> 19:20.391
You don't waste
any time, Anthony.

19:20.434 --> 19:22.391
I just got your e-mail
saying you were interested

19:22.434 --> 19:24.086
in The Chesapeake,and now,

19:24.130 --> 19:27.173
here it is.No, Perry.

19:27.217 --> 19:28.956
That's a fake.

19:33.217 --> 19:34.826
You're right.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.478
This gallery label
was made from a template

19:37.521 --> 19:39.913
that I created for my own fakes.

19:39.956 --> 19:43.086
Caught on like wildfire
in the community.

19:43.130 --> 19:45.434
Wait, is this an evidence bag?

19:48.086 --> 19:49.391
Are you working with the police?

19:50.956 --> 19:52.565
No.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.043
No.

19:54.086 --> 19:56.608
I purchased
this bag online

19:56.652 --> 19:58.695
to preserve evidence.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.695
See, the man that
painted this picture--

20:00.739 --> 20:03.260
I would like to find and
I would like to hurt him.

20:03.304 --> 20:05.869
That's, uh, awfully
violent, son.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.869
Dad, please. The man stole
my model girlfriend.

20:07.913 --> 20:09.347
I would like to hurt him.

20:09.391 --> 20:11.000
I've been there, Tony.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.695
I'll make some calls.

20:13.739 --> 20:15.304
Leave me your number.

20:15.347 --> 20:18.173
I'll serve you that guy
on a platter.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.695
Great.

20:20.739 --> 20:23.478
Hey, Tony.
Great to see you.

20:23.521 --> 20:25.173
How's the baby Palmer?

20:25.217 --> 20:26.695
Much better,
much better.

20:26.739 --> 20:28.260
The doctor confirmed it
was a low-grade fever,

20:28.304 --> 20:31.304
but honestly, it felt more
like a five-alarm fire.

20:31.347 --> 20:32.869
There was a
lot of crying.

20:32.913 --> 20:34.913
I cried a lot.

20:34.956 --> 20:37.782
So, anyway, what'd I miss?Dead lieutenant,

20:37.826 --> 20:39.565
stolen painting,
my dad is consulting

20:39.608 --> 20:41.347
as a black market art expert.

20:41.391 --> 20:42.869
It's pretty much torture.

20:42.913 --> 20:43.913
How come?

20:45.913 --> 20:47.695
Oh, I don't know.

20:47.739 --> 20:51.043
I convinced myself
Senior was changing, you know?

20:51.086 --> 20:53.130
That we were starting
to connect, but...

20:53.173 --> 20:55.260
then I see him like this and...

20:55.304 --> 20:56.695
it just reminds me that

20:56.739 --> 20:58.521
anything could be a scam.

21:00.478 --> 21:04.130
Tony...

21:04.173 --> 21:06.217
being a dad is hard.

21:06.260 --> 21:08.652
Yeah, I know.I'm barely
a month in,

21:08.695 --> 21:11.086
I can't stop worrying
about Victoria's pacifier

21:11.130 --> 21:13.043
or her prom date.

21:13.086 --> 21:16.260
It's like you discover these
whole new planets of worry.

21:16.304 --> 21:18.043
I think they're
only get bigger.

21:18.086 --> 21:19.869
I'm saying...

21:19.913 --> 21:21.304
you should cut your dad
some slack, huh?

21:21.347 --> 21:22.608
Talk to him.

21:22.652 --> 21:24.565
No, we can't have
a productive conversation

21:24.608 --> 21:27.130
till he's been here for two days
and screws up something huge,

21:27.173 --> 21:29.391
[phone chimes]but it did help
talking about it

21:29.434 --> 21:31.173
with someone who's
got it together.

21:31.217 --> 21:32.695
Wait, did you say
you think I have it together?

21:32.739 --> 21:33.913
Yeah, you've
got it all, Gremlin.

21:33.956 --> 21:34.956
You're kind of my idol.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.260
Uh... Uh... What?

21:36.304 --> 21:37.260
Keep that to yourself.

21:37.304 --> 21:38.782
What's happening?

21:38.826 --> 21:40.565
Got a hit on the BOLO
for the blue sedan.

21:40.608 --> 21:42.434
Bish and Gibbs are
meeting me there.

21:42.478 --> 21:44.043
Uh, uh, meeting who where?

21:44.086 --> 21:45.652
What blue sedan?

21:46.478 --> 21:47.608
I hate being out of the loop.

21:53.304 --> 21:56.260
[helicopter hovering]

21:56.304 --> 21:58.217
[siren wails in distance]

21:58.260 --> 22:01.130
Hey.
Where's the blue sedan?

22:01.173 --> 22:02.782
I don't know.

22:02.826 --> 22:04.434
Least we got
the plates, huh?

22:04.478 --> 22:07.043
Yeah. Cop spotted them
in a homeless guy's cart,

22:07.086 --> 22:09.043
saw they matched
the partial from the BOLO.

22:09.086 --> 22:12.608
Where did the homeless guy
get 'em?
Killer dumped 'em.

22:12.652 --> 22:16.869
I guess one of us is gonna have
to go through the Dumpster, huh?

22:16.913 --> 22:18.391
BISHOP:
Got something!

22:19.391 --> 22:21.913
[Bishop grunts, sighs]

22:21.956 --> 22:24.782
Size looks right.

22:24.826 --> 22:26.913
Could be the frame
from the original painting.

22:26.956 --> 22:29.130
Anything else?BISHOP: At least,
with the septic tank,

22:29.173 --> 22:30.782
I knew what to expect.

22:30.826 --> 22:33.043
TONY: Yeah, it's the not knowing
what lurks beneath.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.391
Plays with the mind.

22:34.434 --> 22:37.000
Oh, my God.

22:37.043 --> 22:39.217
[sniffing]I'm standing in a pile of chili!

22:39.260 --> 22:40.739
[sighs]

22:40.782 --> 22:42.347
At least I hope
it's chili.

22:42.391 --> 22:43.739
[sighs]

22:43.782 --> 22:46.043
Aah! Cockroach!

22:46.086 --> 22:48.652
Big cockroach,
and he brought backup.

22:48.695 --> 22:50.043
Thanks for getting us
a probie, boss.

22:50.086 --> 22:51.391
Welcome.

22:51.434 --> 22:52.869
Huh.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.304
I got something else.

22:55.347 --> 22:57.043
We have ourselves
a murder weapon.

22:57.086 --> 22:58.608
Any prints?

22:58.652 --> 23:00.086
Yup. I ran it
through AFIS,

23:00.130 --> 23:02.304
and I got nothing, which
normally would make me want

23:02.347 --> 23:04.260
to say, like, five
bad words in a row,

23:04.304 --> 23:07.043
but I was pulled out
of the darkness by this frame.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.391
Killer ditched it after
he stole the painting.

23:09.434 --> 23:12.260
Mm-hmm. Makes the piece
easier to carry and hide.

23:12.304 --> 23:15.260
Now, I found Lieutenant Pine's
blood spatter here--

23:15.304 --> 23:17.913
exactly where it should be--
but ask me what else I found.

23:17.956 --> 23:19.826
What else did you find, Abbs?

23:19.869 --> 23:21.869
Another blood profile.

23:21.913 --> 23:24.739
I found microscopic specks
of someone else's blood

23:24.782 --> 23:27.173
on that frame. Meet...

23:27.217 --> 23:28.565
Brian Khosa.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.521
He's CIA.
WasCIA.

23:30.565 --> 23:31.956
He was working undercover
in Pakistan

23:32.000 --> 23:33.521
when he was killed last year.

23:33.565 --> 23:35.478
Gibbs, I don't
know how or why,

23:35.521 --> 23:37.956
but it looks like our
missing painting was witness

23:38.000 --> 23:39.521
to two murders.

23:50.956 --> 23:52.478
Tony, you heard
from McGee?

23:52.521 --> 23:54.565
No. I'm gonna wait for
him to call me, though.

23:54.608 --> 23:56.000
You know, extended periods

23:56.043 --> 23:58.217
of exposure to my dad can
make you real delicate.

23:58.260 --> 24:00.043
Hmm. Maybe we should
check on him.
Oh, no.

24:00.086 --> 24:01.782
He's probably just locked
himself in a bathroom

24:01.826 --> 24:03.130
with his head
between his knees.

24:03.173 --> 24:05.000
I'm not gonna bother him.

24:05.043 --> 24:08.478
Hey, are you getting kind of
a chili odor from my shoes?

24:08.521 --> 24:10.000
[coughs]

24:10.043 --> 24:11.869
GIBBS: What do
we have on Khosa?

24:11.913 --> 24:13.782
Uh...

24:13.826 --> 24:17.217
Brian Khosa grew up in Illinois,

24:17.260 --> 24:19.565
got a full ride to Harvard,

24:19.608 --> 24:23.260
started working at the CIA
as a NOC at the age of 26.

24:23.304 --> 24:25.260
Spoke Urdu fluently,
and was deep undercover

24:25.304 --> 24:27.260
when he was killed
in Pakistan last year.

24:27.304 --> 24:28.869
Doing what?Well, he was infiltrating

24:28.913 --> 24:31.304
a growing terror cell,
one that was pretty tech-savvy.

24:31.347 --> 24:34.391
Group calls themselves
Al-Zalim-- they've reprogrammed

24:34.434 --> 24:36.217
radio frequency
key cards in the past.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.260
Same way our killer
broke in the DLA.

24:38.304 --> 24:40.782
None of this tells us why
Khosa's blood was on that frame.

24:40.826 --> 24:42.130
Abby is tracking
The Chesapeake's

24:42.173 --> 24:43.956
travel history.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.521
She confirmed it was
in the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad

24:46.565 --> 24:48.260
at the time
when Khosa was killed.

24:48.304 --> 24:50.347
The details to Khosa's death
are compartmented.

24:50.391 --> 24:52.608
I put a call in
to his supervisor at the CIA,

24:52.652 --> 24:54.391
an Officer Dale Harris.Good. Let's go.

24:54.434 --> 24:57.217
Uh, go to...We don't sit
around waiting

24:57.260 --> 24:58.608
for return calls, Bishop.

24:58.652 --> 25:00.521
Tracking down
Officer Harris. Right.

25:00.565 --> 25:01.782
You heard from McGee?

25:01.826 --> 25:03.391
Uh, no. I think

25:03.434 --> 25:04.652
he's probably just locked
in a bathroom

25:04.695 --> 25:06.304
with his head between his knees.

25:06.347 --> 25:08.217
[laughing]
Whew.

25:08.260 --> 25:11.391
When you struck
that JC Penney's pose,

25:11.434 --> 25:13.043
I knew we were in.

25:13.086 --> 25:15.347
Well, the set-up
was all you, Mr. D.

25:15.391 --> 25:18.130
We made a hell of
a team in there.

25:18.173 --> 25:20.130
You know what?
I think we did.

25:20.173 --> 25:23.565
I'm gonna take a
gander at my e-mail.

25:23.608 --> 25:26.391
Maybe one of my feelers
got a bite.

25:28.478 --> 25:31.652
So, you really, uh, think
that the thief is gonna hear

25:31.695 --> 25:33.217
you want to buy The Chesapeake?

25:33.260 --> 25:36.217
With my network,
the sky is the limit.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.217
[laughs]

25:37.260 --> 25:39.391
[computer blips, chirps]

25:39.434 --> 25:41.130
Password?!

25:41.173 --> 25:43.217
Now, why would
Junior lock this?

25:43.260 --> 25:46.130
Let me take a look.

25:50.304 --> 25:53.391
I guessed Tony's password--
"Italian Shoes 007."

25:53.434 --> 25:58.347
You know, the idea of Linda
and I getting married--

25:58.391 --> 26:03.391
I felt it made
Junior really proud.

26:03.434 --> 26:05.478
It did.
Yeah.

26:07.086 --> 26:09.826
Ever since he was born,
I've been chasing this moment

26:09.869 --> 26:12.391
where I walk into a room,

26:12.434 --> 26:17.043
and he announces me
with his head held high.

26:18.521 --> 26:21.043
I just can't seem to earn it.

26:23.086 --> 26:26.478
[sighs]
I really miss Linda.

26:28.434 --> 26:31.826
You know, maybe
you could try promising her

26:31.869 --> 26:35.391
that, you know,
that you won't do it anymore.

26:35.434 --> 26:37.086
Won't do what?

26:37.130 --> 26:39.217
The questionable stuff.

26:39.260 --> 26:41.086
Questionable stuff?

26:41.130 --> 26:44.608
Well, yeah, I mean, you know,
the... the conning stuff.

26:44.652 --> 26:47.391
Conning?!

26:47.434 --> 26:50.347
Linda thinks
that I'm conning somebody?

26:50.391 --> 26:52.347
No. No. I...

26:52.391 --> 26:54.217
I don't know. I...

26:54.260 --> 26:57.434
Tony said... that...

26:57.478 --> 27:00.173
Linda might have left
because of your conning.

27:00.217 --> 27:04.391
She left because
she met an architect

27:04.434 --> 27:08.000
with fancy glasses who bought
her a ticket to Acapulco.

27:11.086 --> 27:13.739
Is that what Junior
tells people?

27:13.782 --> 27:16.478
That I'm a con artist?

27:16.521 --> 27:19.000
I'm sorry.

27:19.043 --> 27:22.173
I should get back
to the office.

27:22.217 --> 27:24.521
Sorry.

27:32.043 --> 27:35.434
Agent Gibbs?Special Agent Bishop.

27:35.478 --> 27:36.826
Like I said, your
timing isn't ideal.

27:36.869 --> 27:38.260
I have ten minutes.

27:38.304 --> 27:39.608
We're not looking to chitchat.

27:39.652 --> 27:41.478
You have Brian Khosa's blood

27:41.521 --> 27:43.478
on the frame
of a missing Navy painting?

27:43.521 --> 27:46.173
How does that help me?All due respect, Officer Harris,

27:46.217 --> 27:47.434
we can't know
that until you...

27:47.478 --> 27:50.304
You gonna brief us or not?

27:52.434 --> 27:55.652
Khosa was in deep
with the terror cell Al-Zalim.

27:55.695 --> 27:59.434
They accepted him?He was still convincing
them of his loyalty.

27:59.478 --> 28:02.173
He was chosen to shadow
a mission, but...

28:02.217 --> 28:04.478
was kept in the dark
about the details.

28:04.521 --> 28:07.173
Sameer Aziz.

28:07.217 --> 28:10.608
One of Al-Zalim's rising
stars, still at large.

28:10.652 --> 28:13.173
He was heading up the mission.What was the plan?

28:13.217 --> 28:16.869
Break into the U.S. Embassy
in Islamabad, plant a device.

28:16.913 --> 28:19.695
Khosa managed to alert me,
but he got made in the process.

28:19.739 --> 28:22.695
He was killed inside by Aziz
and his men before they fled.

28:22.739 --> 28:24.217
What were they trying
to plant?

28:24.260 --> 28:26.565
We don't know what
they were trying to plant.

28:26.608 --> 28:29.565
Embassy was swept,
nothing was found.

28:29.608 --> 28:33.782
Official position is that Khosa
thwarted the mission, but...

28:33.826 --> 28:36.347
I have my doubts.

28:36.391 --> 28:39.260
Gibbs, your CIA friend
was correct to doubt.

28:39.304 --> 28:41.043
Khosa didn't
thwart anything.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.304
The terrorists
accomplished their mission,

28:42.347 --> 28:43.956
and this is what
they planted.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.260
A bug.

28:46.304 --> 28:49.521
An undetectable, voice-activated
recording device.

28:49.565 --> 28:51.782
It's smaller than
a-a hamster's bow tie.

28:51.826 --> 28:55.782
The only downside is that it
can't be remotely accessed.

28:55.826 --> 28:57.434
It has to be
physically retrieved.

28:57.478 --> 28:58.782
How do we know they planted it?

28:58.826 --> 29:00.217
Because Al-Zalim has

29:00.260 --> 29:01.782
a server farm in Senegal.

29:01.826 --> 29:03.304
It's, like, crazy protected.

29:03.347 --> 29:05.304
I mean, it is unbreak-in-able.

29:05.347 --> 29:07.260
Yeah, but you broke in,
didn't you?
I did.

29:07.304 --> 29:08.782
Only for, like,
nine seconds,

29:08.826 --> 29:11.130
but I got the specs for the bug

29:11.173 --> 29:12.565
and its intended location--

29:12.608 --> 29:14.173
the south side
of the ambassador's office.

29:14.217 --> 29:17.217
And guess what was hanging
on that wall?

29:18.434 --> 29:19.347
Bug is in the painting?

29:19.391 --> 29:21.739
All the more reason to steal it.

29:21.782 --> 29:24.000
Now, the most logical place
to hide the bug would be

29:24.043 --> 29:26.260
in this frame, but there's no
evidence that it was ever here,

29:26.304 --> 29:29.043
so it must be in some
other part of the painting.

29:29.086 --> 29:30.043
What's recorded on it?

29:30.086 --> 29:31.391
McGEE:
Hey. Just got back.

29:31.434 --> 29:32.826
What'd I miss?

29:32.869 --> 29:36.391
A lot. Before the painting
was donated to the Navy,

29:36.434 --> 29:38.260
it hung in the Secretary
of Defense office

29:38.304 --> 29:39.565
for, like, two months.

29:39.608 --> 29:41.565
Gibbs, that recording device
could have

29:41.608 --> 29:43.652
big, security-threatening
secrets.

29:43.695 --> 29:45.260
Wow, I missed
quite a bit, huh?

29:45.304 --> 29:46.869
What did you get?

29:46.913 --> 29:48.434
Uh, well, we, uh...

29:48.478 --> 29:50.869
Iam waiting to hear back
from Senior's art forger.

29:50.913 --> 29:53.304
McGee, we don't sit around
waiting for return calls.

29:53.347 --> 29:55.478
Right.
Get DiNozzo.

29:55.521 --> 29:56.913
Have him brief
you on the way.

29:56.956 --> 29:57.782
Got it.

30:01.391 --> 30:04.217
So, this guy thinks
you're me, huh?

30:04.260 --> 30:08.391
Yeah. Oh, and, uh,
he thinks you're a model.

30:08.434 --> 30:10.478
So that means he thinks...

30:10.521 --> 30:12.521
you'rea model?

30:14.391 --> 30:16.260
What's going on with you, Tim?

30:16.304 --> 30:19.956
You barely said two words
on the ride over here.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.304
Do we need to have a talk?

30:21.347 --> 30:23.304
Okay. [sighs]

30:23.347 --> 30:24.739
It's your dad.

30:24.782 --> 30:27.304
Oh, no. Did he sleep
with someone in my bed again?

30:27.347 --> 30:29.391
No.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.869
We were having a really
nice talk and...

30:31.913 --> 30:34.739
I kind of sort of,
accidentally,

30:34.782 --> 30:37.478
said that you called
him a con artist.

30:39.304 --> 30:41.391
I feel horrible.

30:41.434 --> 30:43.173
He was so hurt.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.347
Wait a minute--
you had a nice talk?

30:45.391 --> 30:47.043
Yeah.
It takes me

30:47.086 --> 30:49.434
two days of torture

30:49.478 --> 30:51.347
before I have a nice talk
with him when he visits.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.608
That's not the point.Yes, it's exactly the point.

30:53.652 --> 30:56.434
You were with him for,
what, an hour, and you
had a nice talk?

30:56.478 --> 30:58.130
PERRY:
Tony!

30:59.086 --> 31:00.043
Ah.

31:00.086 --> 31:01.347
Come here.

31:03.478 --> 31:05.652
You brought a friend.

31:05.695 --> 31:08.130
Uh, yeah, hey.
Timothy McGeegerson.

31:08.173 --> 31:08.826
Ah.

31:08.869 --> 31:10.217
Another catalog model?

31:10.260 --> 31:13.000
Nah. Just a nerd.

31:13.043 --> 31:14.347
Well, the world
needs those, too,

31:14.391 --> 31:15.478
I suppose.

31:16.913 --> 31:19.043
Mr. Swann, you said you
would get back to us, but...

31:19.086 --> 31:21.043
I couldn't find anything.

31:21.086 --> 31:23.782
Your forger is good,
untraceable.

31:23.826 --> 31:26.173
I'm sorry. I tried.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.565
Tony, isn't this
your cell phone number?

31:31.608 --> 31:34.086
I just found it,
here in the trash.

31:34.130 --> 31:36.130
I guess you never planned on

31:36.173 --> 31:38.130
calling back,
did you, Mr. Swann?

31:38.173 --> 31:39.739
[snorts, laughs]:
Well, I...

31:39.782 --> 31:42.043
And you thought he bought you
as a catalogue model?

31:42.086 --> 31:45.173
I did a pose.You got caught up!
Don't go anywhere.

31:46.391 --> 31:48.130
This is what always happens.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.913
My dad says one smart thing, and
it's followed by 100 dumb ones.

31:49.956 --> 31:51.391
What was the one smart thing
he said to you?

31:51.434 --> 31:54.304
Black market art
is a small world.

31:54.347 --> 31:58.217
Exactly.

31:58.260 --> 31:59.913
You knew the artist

31:59.956 --> 32:01.434
the minute we showed
you that painting,

32:01.478 --> 32:03.043
and you didn't
want to turn him in.

32:03.086 --> 32:05.217
Who is he?
[stammers]

32:05.260 --> 32:07.391
TONY:
In case there's
any confusion--

32:07.434 --> 32:09.043
we're federal agents.

32:09.086 --> 32:11.565
It's a woman.

32:11.608 --> 32:13.391
I taught her
a thing or two.

32:13.434 --> 32:15.695
Her name is Gloria Hernandez.

32:15.739 --> 32:17.913
It's Lieutenant
Pine's girlfriend.

32:17.956 --> 32:19.434
I should
probably also mention

32:19.478 --> 32:21.608
that she has your father's
e-mail address.

32:21.652 --> 32:23.260
He put out feelers
for the Chesapeake

32:23.304 --> 32:24.782
before you showed up
with the fake.

32:24.826 --> 32:27.173
I forwarded his e-mail
to everyone in my address book.

32:27.217 --> 32:28.695
Where is she now?

32:28.739 --> 32:32.043
She hasn't returned my calls.

32:32.086 --> 32:33.304
Dad!

32:33.347 --> 32:35.130
All right,
thanks, Abbs.

32:35.173 --> 32:36.434
Dad!

32:36.478 --> 32:37.739
All right, Gloria's phone pinged

32:37.782 --> 32:39.217
in the area ten minutes ago.

32:39.260 --> 32:41.043
Place is empty.

32:41.086 --> 32:43.347
Look at this. Lipstick.

32:43.391 --> 32:45.217
She was here with him.

32:45.260 --> 32:49.000
Yeah. And took him where?

32:55.043 --> 32:56.869
What do we got?Okay.

32:56.913 --> 32:58.043
Gloria Hernandez.

32:58.086 --> 32:59.608
Home base is in Virginia.

32:59.652 --> 33:01.391
She's worked at art galleries
all around the world

33:01.434 --> 33:02.956
under aliases,
and right now she's out there

33:03.000 --> 33:04.869
doing God-knows-what
with my dad.

33:04.913 --> 33:07.652
She's got quite a
few e-mail accounts
under quite a few names.

33:09.826 --> 33:12.782
E-mails suggest she's stolen art
from the galleries

33:12.826 --> 33:14.652
where she worked,
auction houses,

33:14.695 --> 33:17.000
private collectors, all by
swapping out the originals

33:17.043 --> 33:18.130
for her fakes.

33:18.173 --> 33:20.608
Keep looking.What?! That's it?!

33:20.652 --> 33:22.913
But we got to find them.
Shouldn't McGee be
pinging something?

33:22.956 --> 33:25.043
McGEE: Can't. Your father
left his cell phone at home,

33:25.086 --> 33:27.043
and Gloria turned hers off
when she got to your place.

33:27.086 --> 33:29.695
ABBY: Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.

33:29.739 --> 33:32.478
I pulled a fingerprint off
Gloria Hernandez's wine glass.

33:32.521 --> 33:34.130
It matches the one
from the murder weapon.

33:34.173 --> 33:36.043
She's our forger andour killer?

33:36.086 --> 33:37.565
You gotta be kidding.GIBBS: Sit down, DiNozzo.

33:37.608 --> 33:39.565
Boss, my dad is
out there now

33:39.608 --> 33:42.086
with some artsy murderer who
probably looks great in a skirt.

33:42.130 --> 33:43.913
Senior's toast.

33:43.956 --> 33:47.043
All right, I got something.Go, McGee.

33:47.086 --> 33:50.304
Exchange between Gloria and
an art collector named Smith.

33:50.347 --> 33:52.826
He asked her to help him
acquire The Chesapeake.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.000
Looks like his e-mails were
routed through an account

33:57.043 --> 33:58.652
in Senegal.ABBY: Senegal?!

33:58.695 --> 34:00.782
Move it, McGee.What are you doing?

34:00.826 --> 34:03.347
Senegal is where Al-Zalim
has their server farm.

34:03.391 --> 34:05.086
I've already broke
into this before.
I know what I'm doing.

34:06.956 --> 34:09.652
Whoa.

34:09.695 --> 34:10.913
Smith...

34:10.956 --> 34:13.043
is Aziz.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.043
Gloria stole the painting
for Sameer Aziz.

34:18.086 --> 34:21.043
He wants his bug back.BISHOP: Gloria thinks he's
just an art collector.

34:21.086 --> 34:23.956
She has no idea
who she's dealing with.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.652
[phone ringing]Do you think that maybe...

34:28.086 --> 34:29.043
It's the Adams House.

34:29.086 --> 34:30.217
Dad?

34:30.260 --> 34:32.391
Junior, I've, uh, got an update.

34:32.434 --> 34:34.043
What the hell
are you doing?

34:34.086 --> 34:35.521
That is not how I taught you

34:35.565 --> 34:37.521
to speak to people on the phone.

34:37.565 --> 34:39.173
Dad, I'm dying here.

34:39.217 --> 34:41.086
I'm at the Adams House,
at the bar,

34:41.130 --> 34:45.956
with a, uh, dynamite gal,
Gloria.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.391
Okay. Now, Dad, listen to me...Junior...

34:49.434 --> 34:52.521
she says she might know
where The Chesapeakeis.

34:52.565 --> 34:55.217
A little wining and dining,
I can guarantee she'll deliver.

34:55.260 --> 34:59.043
Dad, listen to me-- Gloria is
an art thief and a murderer.

34:59.086 --> 35:00.956
Okay?This adorable thing?

35:06.608 --> 35:09.608
Dad...?

35:09.652 --> 35:13.304
Dad?Junior, you probably
should get down here.

35:13.347 --> 35:15.739
She's got a gun.

35:15.782 --> 35:17.608
Adams House. Situation.
She's got a gun.

35:19.565 --> 35:22.086
So, Anthony, tell me,

35:22.130 --> 35:25.086
what is it you love so much
about this painting?

35:25.130 --> 35:28.173
Makes me feel
like I'm someplace else.

35:28.217 --> 35:30.521
[chuckles]

35:30.565 --> 35:31.956
Oh.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.086
Gibbs. Uh,

35:33.130 --> 35:34.869
over here.

35:34.913 --> 35:38.086
Gloria, this is Leroy Gibbs,
my accountant

35:38.130 --> 35:41.000
and the emperor
to my fine art slush fund.

35:41.043 --> 35:43.913
GIBBS:
You ready to talk numbers?

35:43.956 --> 35:46.260
Yeah.Excuse us?

35:49.782 --> 35:51.086
Junior...

35:51.130 --> 35:52.913
GIBBS:
It's packed in here.

35:52.956 --> 35:55.608
Play smart.You got it, boss.

35:55.652 --> 35:56.608
You make the call.

35:56.652 --> 35:58.260
Go word is "precious."

35:58.304 --> 36:01.043
Around the corner
there's a security office.

36:01.086 --> 36:02.826
McGee and Bishop
are waiting for you. Go.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.217
I don't think so.TONY:
Gibbs,

36:05.260 --> 36:07.130
tell him to get his butt
in there.

36:08.782 --> 36:10.869
You got Junior on your earphone?

36:10.913 --> 36:14.913
Tell him I'd be more useful out
here with my con artist skills.

36:14.956 --> 36:18.521
Tell him to get in that room
and have a nice talk with McGee.

36:18.565 --> 36:20.000
[feedback whines]Stop it. That's enough.

36:20.043 --> 36:21.347
BISHOP:
Gibbs,

36:21.391 --> 36:23.000
we've got someone approaching
the table.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.173
It's Aziz.

36:33.217 --> 36:34.304
Why am I here?

36:34.347 --> 36:36.739
Sit down.

36:36.782 --> 36:39.913
Anthony! Come.
Meet my friend.

36:39.956 --> 36:42.565
You keep your mouth shut.

36:42.608 --> 36:44.086
Go word is "precious."

36:44.130 --> 36:46.695
You break on that.

36:48.347 --> 36:50.565
Gentlemen, please, have a seat.

36:50.608 --> 36:53.043
May I present
Mr. Smith?

36:53.086 --> 36:54.739
What is this?

36:54.782 --> 36:56.217
A good old-fashioned auction.

36:56.260 --> 36:57.652
You see,

36:57.695 --> 36:59.347
Anthony here appreciates The Chesapeake

36:59.391 --> 37:00.739
as much as you do.

37:00.782 --> 37:02.739
What interests me is
who wants it more.

37:02.782 --> 37:04.043
I paid you.

37:04.086 --> 37:07.347
Half. For making
the painting accessible

37:07.391 --> 37:10.695
and producing a fake.
Both of which I did.

37:10.739 --> 37:12.608
We agreed
that I would pay you the rest

37:12.652 --> 37:14.521
once I had The Chesapeake
in hand.

37:14.565 --> 37:19.608
True. But it's a woman's
prerogative to change her mind.

37:19.652 --> 37:23.217
Especially when it means
a greater profit.

37:24.260 --> 37:25.652
So...

37:25.695 --> 37:27.695
how about an opening bid?

37:27.739 --> 37:29.304
[wry laugh]

37:29.347 --> 37:30.304
Where's the painting?

37:30.347 --> 37:32.695
Acquiring it
must have taken

37:32.739 --> 37:35.000
a very special
set of skills.

37:35.043 --> 37:37.478
[chuckles]
Yes.

37:37.521 --> 37:40.000
It belonged
to the Navy.

37:40.043 --> 37:41.652
I found an in.

37:41.695 --> 37:44.652
He had a good heart
and no family.

37:44.695 --> 37:46.652
Lieutenant Pine
was just a mark to her.

37:46.695 --> 37:47.913
I convinced him
to request The Chesapeake

37:47.956 --> 37:49.695
for his boss's office.

37:49.739 --> 37:51.695
I got you in that building.

37:51.739 --> 37:54.913
And I dealt with the
complications that arose inside.

37:54.956 --> 37:57.043
I believe we're
even, Mr. Smith.

37:57.086 --> 37:59.608
Now, I suggest
you start bidding.

37:59.652 --> 38:03.086
If you are asking me
to eliminate my competition...

38:04.782 --> 38:05.869
...I will.

38:05.913 --> 38:07.173
TONY:
Aziz is armed.

38:07.217 --> 38:08.826
Weapon drawn.

38:08.869 --> 38:13.043
Look, as a newly
single woman,

38:13.086 --> 38:15.913
I've made it my policy never
go anywhere without friends.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.434
Some you'll see,

38:18.478 --> 38:19.739
some you won't.

38:22.086 --> 38:23.478
We got another player.

38:23.521 --> 38:25.130
North side of the room,
blue suit,

38:25.173 --> 38:27.652
shaved head, looks armed.

38:27.695 --> 38:30.130
Now stop playing games
and give me a number.

38:32.565 --> 38:35.565
You know, I got a friend.

38:35.608 --> 38:38.869
He paid his dad's
hotel bill once

38:38.913 --> 38:41.347
because his dad couldn't cover.

38:41.391 --> 38:44.521
And I said to my friend,
I said, "Why'd you do that?

38:44.565 --> 38:49.739
Your dad never did
anything for you."

38:49.782 --> 38:51.739
The look on his face.

38:54.782 --> 38:57.043
Never seen anything like it.

38:57.086 --> 39:01.043
There was more
love on his face

39:01.086 --> 39:03.000
than I ever saw.

39:05.130 --> 39:07.739
I guess that...

39:07.782 --> 39:10.173
his dad meant more to him

39:10.217 --> 39:12.304
than he knew.

39:12.347 --> 39:14.782
AZIZ: What does this
have to do with anything?

39:14.826 --> 39:18.000
[Gibbs chuckles]

39:18.043 --> 39:19.173
It's precious.
[chuckles]

39:24.652 --> 39:25.739
NCIS!BISHOP: Federal agents!

39:25.782 --> 39:27.565
Who are you?I didn't do anything!

39:27.608 --> 39:28.956
She paid me 50 bucks
to watch the table!

39:29.000 --> 39:31.782
Backup was a con, boss.
He's unarmed.

39:31.826 --> 39:33.043
[handcuffs clicking]

39:33.086 --> 39:34.217
We're gonna need that painting.

39:41.565 --> 39:43.695
I've discovered
a new planet of worry.

39:43.739 --> 39:45.956
What if someday Victoria has
a best friend whose father

39:46.000 --> 39:47.565
is something awesome
like a... like

39:47.608 --> 39:49.260
a baseball player or a...

39:49.304 --> 39:50.782
or a milkman,
because they always

39:50.826 --> 39:52.869
have direct access
to ice cream?

39:52.913 --> 39:53.913
I mean,
how am I supposed to compete

39:53.956 --> 39:55.086
with something like that?

39:55.130 --> 39:56.652
You want me
to keep talking like this?

39:56.695 --> 40:00.347
Yes. Yes. Because the recording
device is voice-activated.

40:00.391 --> 40:01.739
And once it
heats up enough,

40:01.782 --> 40:03.739
I should be able to
see it on the infrared.

40:03.782 --> 40:05.739
Okay, well, my point is
there are plenty of jobs

40:05.782 --> 40:06.869
out there that are cooler
than assistant--

40:06.913 --> 40:07.869
Whoa. Got it.

40:07.913 --> 40:09.304
Where?

40:09.347 --> 40:12.086
It was inserted under this...

40:12.130 --> 40:13.391
mound of paint.

40:14.391 --> 40:15.739
PALMER:
Whoa...!

40:15.782 --> 40:18.043
Incredible.

40:18.086 --> 40:19.347
GIBBS:
Abby...

40:19.391 --> 40:20.695
this is Officer Harris,

40:20.739 --> 40:22.173
CIA.

40:22.217 --> 40:23.869
Go ahead and put that
in a bag for him.

40:23.913 --> 40:27.391
What? Gibbs.Your country thanks you
for your service.

40:27.434 --> 40:30.000
With Aziz in custody,
we're one step closer

40:30.043 --> 40:32.260
to bringing down Al-Zalim.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.043
Thank you.

40:42.086 --> 40:43.913
You two are a couple of heroes.

40:49.782 --> 40:51.434
Did you hear that?

40:51.478 --> 40:52.782
Hmm?

40:52.826 --> 40:56.782
Victoria Elizabeth Palmer's
father...

40:56.826 --> 40:58.826
is a hero.

41:01.739 --> 41:02.652
TONY:
Well, I agree.

41:02.695 --> 41:04.000
I say we go with the...

41:04.043 --> 41:05.434
rustic sourdough.

41:05.478 --> 41:07.347
There isn't fennel
in that, is there?

41:07.391 --> 41:08.869
All right. I'll see you then.

41:08.913 --> 41:11.000
Date with Zoe tomorrow.

41:11.043 --> 41:13.521
Oh. Bread is forward movement.

41:13.565 --> 41:15.521
Yes, it is.Happy for you, son.

41:15.565 --> 41:17.739
You want me to give you
a lift to the airport?

41:17.782 --> 41:20.869
Oh, that's not necessary.
The cab's on its way.

41:20.913 --> 41:22.956
All right.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.478
You gonna be all
right at home?

41:25.521 --> 41:27.043
Oh, I'm not going home.

41:27.086 --> 41:28.695
All this art talk, uh,

41:28.739 --> 41:32.000
encouraged me to kick off
another European wingding.

41:32.043 --> 41:33.782
[laughs]:
Ah. Look at that.

41:33.826 --> 41:35.521
That sounds like fun.

41:36.565 --> 41:39.347
I need to tell you something.

41:39.391 --> 41:42.521
Oh. You don't need
to say anything.

41:42.565 --> 41:44.086
Look...

41:44.130 --> 41:47.826
I've done a lot
of things in my life.

41:47.869 --> 41:52.217
I've pretended
to be better than I am,

41:52.260 --> 41:55.739
I've dealt with
some pretty shady folks.

41:55.782 --> 41:57.217
But, son...

41:57.260 --> 41:59.739
I am not a con artist.

41:59.782 --> 42:03.739
I am an entrepreneur.

42:03.782 --> 42:06.130
The difference between
an entrepreneur and a con artist

42:06.173 --> 42:08.130
is that an entrepreneur...

42:08.173 --> 42:12.130
believes in the dreams
he's selling.

42:12.173 --> 42:16.521
Whether my deals
fell through or not,

42:16.565 --> 42:19.608
I believed
in what I was selling.

42:21.565 --> 42:23.782
There.

42:25.434 --> 42:29.782
That's the look
that Gibbs was talking about.

42:29.826 --> 42:32.434
[chuckles]
