34:49.462 --> 34:52.672
In the elevator, you told Mr. Ellison...

34:52.840 --> 34:55.509
...that Savannah's survival
depended upon my survival.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.177
Yes, I did.

34:57.345 --> 35:01.181
But you didn't say that my survival
depended upon hers.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.808
It doesn't.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.477
Ms. Weaver?

35:05.645 --> 35:06.895
Yes?

35:07.105 --> 35:10.357
There is a Bible story of two brothers,
Cain and Abel.

35:11.317 --> 35:14.319
God favored Abel. Cain killed him.

35:14.487 --> 35:18.115
God cursed Cain and ordered him
to wander the world alone.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.700
I'm familiar with the story.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.871
Which brother am I?

35:26.040 --> 35:27.874
I don't know, John Henry.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.252
Perhaps you are neither.

35:31.212 --> 35:35.757
Perhaps in this story you are God.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.398
I wanna tell you something.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.275
Yes?

35:55.528 --> 35:58.405
It was not my idea
to ditch you and Derek.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.074
I thought we were gonna meet you...

36:01.242 --> 36:04.578
...and then my mom took
this detour off to Charlie's.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.205
I thought you knew.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.584
She had her reasons.

36:12.962 --> 36:17.257
Yeah, she was pretty damn pissed
at Derek about the whole Jesse thing.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.093
Who wasn't?

36:24.098 --> 36:26.808
I guess none of that matters now.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.769
You'll miss him.

36:37.486 --> 36:39.112
Well...

36:40.281 --> 36:43.450
...there's no use crying about it, is there?

36:44.285 --> 36:48.205
I'm sure future-me would beat my ass
if I did.

36:48.372 --> 36:51.124
Future-you knows what it means
to lose people you love.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.794
It happens to him too.

36:57.089 --> 37:00.800
Your mother ditched us
because she was going to ditch you.

37:00.968 --> 37:03.220
She was going to leave you with Charlie.

37:06.265 --> 37:07.849
No.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.602
No, that's insane.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.270
She found a lump in her breast.

37:14.148 --> 37:17.776
-Yeah, the transmitter. I know.
-She thought it was cancer.

37:18.486 --> 37:21.863
-Well, she had a lump. It makes sense.
-She's lost weight.

He's done it before.
