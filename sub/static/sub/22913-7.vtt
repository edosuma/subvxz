WEBVTT

00:01.224 --> 00:02.724
There is a place

00:02.826 --> 00:05.026
all Templars go...
A tree where we leave our past.

00:05.128 --> 00:07.662
- You want Navarre.
- Absolutely not!

00:07.764 --> 00:09.497
I saw Roland having this written...

00:09.599 --> 00:10.565
A message.

00:10.667 --> 00:11.799
A message to who?

00:11.901 --> 00:13.368
Philip will raise your child.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.203
Our child will not know you.

00:15.305 --> 00:16.671
Wake up!

00:16.773 --> 00:18.072
I'm not Godfrey.

00:18.174 --> 00:20.041
I am not a traitor, nor will I ever be.

00:20.143 --> 00:22.043
Wait!
I am the man you're looking for.

00:22.145 --> 00:23.544
I killed your son.

00:23.647 --> 00:25.580
Go back to where you first met Godfrey.

00:25.682 --> 00:27.415
There, you will find what you seek.

00:27.517 --> 00:30.418
He's fooled you all! He murdered Lluis!

00:30.520 --> 00:32.487
You shall be hanged
until death takes you.

00:35.191 --> 00:36.157
Guards!

00:36.259 --> 00:38.426
De Nogaret!

00:41.658 --> 00:43.531
The Navarrese have sent word to Paris

00:43.633 --> 00:45.166
of the hostages you've taken.

00:45.268 --> 00:47.335
They will take it as
an attack on France.

00:50.576 --> 00:52.963
I'm sure your cousin Joan
will not let it pass.

00:53.076 --> 00:54.976
I should hope not.

00:55.078 --> 00:56.811
So this is their leader?

00:56.913 --> 00:57.812
Yes.

00:57.914 --> 00:59.513
Mercy, Your Grace.

00:59.615 --> 01:01.882
The people of Navarre want peace.

01:03.987 --> 01:06.854
My grandfather was Navarrese.

01:07.427 --> 01:08.489
In his honor...

01:08.591 --> 01:09.890
I will spare your life.

01:11.995 --> 01:13.561
But if I release you,

01:13.663 --> 01:15.529
how can I know you will not once again

01:15.631 --> 01:17.400
raise your sword against me?

01:18.324 --> 01:20.901
I give you my word as leader
of the village of Sanguesa,

01:21.004 --> 01:22.837
we will not.

01:25.842 --> 01:28.542
Forgive me if I make certain.

01:28.877 --> 01:30.244
Remove his hands.

01:32.334 --> 01:34.515
No. No!

01:35.647 --> 01:36.518
No, no!

01:43.022 --> 01:45.436
S01E07
And Certainly Not the Cripple

01:45.581 --> 01:48.237
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

01:52.999 --> 01:54.235
You're the one called Landry?

01:54.337 --> 01:55.403
Might be.

01:55.505 --> 01:57.204
Mother Superior tells me you might be

01:57.306 --> 01:58.739
the worst troublemaker here.

01:58.841 --> 02:01.818
Then she'll be glad to let
me leave to be your squire.

02:02.245 --> 02:04.278
It's definitely the right place?

02:04.380 --> 02:07.882
Rashid told me the Grail would
be where I first met Godfrey.

02:08.322 --> 02:10.651
This is where I first met Godfrey.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.987
Hello, Mother.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.667
Do you know this place?

02:14.812 --> 02:16.131
How did it burn?

02:16.276 --> 02:18.993
One of the children was
playing with a candle...

02:19.073 --> 02:20.294
or so I heard.

02:20.396 --> 02:21.729
Thank you.

02:21.831 --> 02:23.931
It's over.

02:24.574 --> 02:26.400
If the Grail was here, it's ash.

02:26.502 --> 02:28.335
I did everything Godfrey told me.

02:28.438 --> 02:30.104
I did everything Rashid told me.

02:30.206 --> 02:31.439
I followed the trail.

02:31.541 --> 02:33.107
I was tortured.

02:34.911 --> 02:36.944
I sent our brother to his death.

02:39.615 --> 02:41.348
Tancrede was right.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.794
God never wanted the Grail to be found.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.512
God's grace be with you.

02:53.262 --> 02:55.129
God's grace be with you.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.934
God's grace be with you.

03:00.036 --> 03:02.203
I haven't seen God's
grace for some time.

03:02.305 --> 03:04.672
Let's be honest,
he hasn't seen mine, either.

03:04.774 --> 03:06.813
There's a price on your head.

03:10.336 --> 03:12.420
Only say the word and I shall be hanged.

03:13.716 --> 03:15.015
I heard your master was taken.

03:15.118 --> 03:17.518
One can only assume it
was about the Grail.

03:18.955 --> 03:21.989
Don't pretend you don't want to
find the grail as much as I do.

03:22.497 --> 03:24.058
Or is this your life now?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.726
Bread for the bewildered?

03:27.330 --> 03:30.631
Imagine if you did find the Grail.

03:30.733 --> 03:33.467
Wouldn't you like to swing
your sword in battle again?

03:35.438 --> 03:37.238
He's given up.

03:37.830 --> 03:38.839
We were sent to an orphanage,

03:38.941 --> 03:40.841
but it was burnt to the ground.

03:40.943 --> 03:43.344
There is no more trail to follow.

03:43.446 --> 03:45.079
It's over.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.148
The Grail has been
"lost forever" before now,

03:47.250 --> 03:49.550
only to show its face soon afterwards.

03:49.652 --> 03:51.519
Why would you want it?

03:51.621 --> 03:53.154
Oh, I don't know.

03:53.256 --> 03:55.189
The greater good.

03:56.626 --> 03:57.976
Go.

03:59.162 --> 04:01.262
Before they see you.

04:11.674 --> 04:13.908
Landry.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.849
Forgive me, Your Holiness.

04:22.316 --> 04:23.951
I have failed you.

04:24.053 --> 04:25.252
How so?

04:25.743 --> 04:26.754
I was taken by a group

04:26.856 --> 04:29.056
calling themselves the
Brotherhood of Light.

04:29.158 --> 04:31.091
I have heard that name.

04:31.194 --> 04:32.891
They are infidels.

04:33.525 --> 04:35.396
Perhaps.

04:37.684 --> 04:40.234
But if they are to be believed,
Godfrey was one of them.

04:40.336 --> 04:42.436
Godfrey was a traitor?

04:44.667 --> 04:46.497
I'm not sure.

04:47.192 --> 04:50.077
His allegiance should have
been to God and to his Pope

04:50.179 --> 04:53.480
and to his follow Templars...
Not to infidels.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.049
His loyalty was to the Grail.

04:55.151 --> 04:57.051
The Brotherhood has
made it their mission

04:57.153 --> 04:59.386
to protect the Grail,
to keep it from the hands of men.

04:59.488 --> 05:02.456
Oh! They have no business!

05:04.393 --> 05:06.477
Forgive me, Father.

05:09.098 --> 05:11.321
I struck a bargain with them.

05:12.335 --> 05:13.734
I let them take Tancrede

05:13.836 --> 05:16.470
in exchange for information
about the Grail.

05:16.572 --> 05:18.639
Dear God.

05:19.206 --> 05:21.912
Have you taken leave of your senses?

05:22.612 --> 05:25.246
They shared with me a
clue that Godfrey left,

05:25.348 --> 05:28.115
something to which only
I would know the answer.

05:28.217 --> 05:29.316
Which was?

05:29.418 --> 05:31.085
The Grail...

05:31.187 --> 05:33.787
was where I first met Godfrey...

05:33.889 --> 05:36.423
the orphanage where I
was left by my mother.

05:36.525 --> 05:40.094
I went there immediately,
but it was burned.

05:40.196 --> 05:41.695
And the Grail?

05:42.399 --> 05:43.264
Gone.

05:43.366 --> 05:44.965
I think it is dust, and if it isn't,

05:45.067 --> 05:47.101
then maybe this Brotherhood
of Light is right,

05:47.203 --> 05:50.021
and God doesn't mean for
the Grail to be found.

05:50.645 --> 05:51.605
You should have informed me

05:51.707 --> 05:53.340
before you undertook this journey.

05:53.442 --> 05:54.942
Forgive me.

05:55.044 --> 05:57.478
I merely wished to retrieve
the Grail as I promised.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.446
And then what?

06:00.715 --> 06:02.783
This Brotherhood of Light...

06:03.240 --> 06:04.652
I-I did not know...

06:06.049 --> 06:07.054
they wanted to protect it,

06:07.286 --> 06:08.722
just as Godfrey had before them.

06:08.824 --> 06:12.126
You would have given the Grail
into the care of the infidels?

06:12.228 --> 06:13.694
No.

06:13.796 --> 06:14.862
I don't know.

06:14.964 --> 06:16.530
Oh, Landry!

06:16.632 --> 06:18.532
You have taken leave of your senses.

06:18.634 --> 06:19.967
Forgive me.

06:20.069 --> 06:22.169
It is fortunate that you
did not find the Grail.

06:22.271 --> 06:24.238
There is a chance that
I could still find it.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.141
If somehow t-this
information is wrong...

06:27.243 --> 06:30.411
Maybe somebody moved the Grail
before the orphanage burned.

06:30.513 --> 06:32.379
Landry... go home to your Temple,

06:32.481 --> 06:34.715
take your seat,
and do your job as Master.

06:34.817 --> 06:37.751
As for this so-called "Brotherhood,"

06:37.853 --> 06:40.154
you're to have nothing
further to do with them.

06:40.256 --> 06:41.155
Holy Father...

06:41.257 --> 06:42.619
Get out.

07:02.178 --> 07:03.744
Thank you.

07:03.846 --> 07:05.346
Do not despair.

07:05.448 --> 07:07.381
There's news from the palace...

07:07.483 --> 07:09.750
that might lift your spirits.

07:09.852 --> 07:12.853
The queen is with child.

07:29.872 --> 07:32.272
My prayers are answered
to see you alive.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.476
I thought you'd give me the time...

07:35.578 --> 07:37.478
to find a way for us.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.645
Time?

07:38.748 --> 07:41.315
My belly is already showing.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.617
My first duty is to
keep this child safe.

07:43.719 --> 07:45.911
By denying its true father?

07:51.093 --> 07:54.828
In my darkest moment,
you appeared to me.

07:56.132 --> 07:59.333
All I could think about
was you and our child.

08:01.871 --> 08:03.504
Landry.

08:03.606 --> 08:05.572
Your Grace.

08:05.674 --> 08:07.107
Had I known you'd been captured,

08:07.209 --> 08:09.410
I would have sent the
Royal Guard immediately.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.446
Thank you, Your Grace.

08:12.548 --> 08:14.648
God has smiled upon us.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.818
He has again blessed
our union with a child.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.587
Congratulations, Your Grace.

08:20.689 --> 08:23.857
Dr. Vigevano is confident
the baby is a boy.

08:24.562 --> 08:26.756
Come. Feel my son.

08:27.863 --> 08:29.830
I don't think the
Master Templar wants...

08:29.932 --> 08:31.932
Come.

08:33.535 --> 08:35.414
Can you feel him?

08:43.611 --> 08:46.280
Forgive me, Your Grace.

08:46.382 --> 08:47.981
Urgent news.

08:52.721 --> 08:54.955
Landry, I'm sorry, excuse us.

09:00.062 --> 09:01.628
What is it?

09:01.730 --> 09:03.497
Navarre has been attacked.

09:03.599 --> 09:05.427
Attacked?! By who?

09:08.571 --> 09:10.471
Pierre?

09:10.573 --> 09:12.005
Can you read?

09:17.513 --> 09:21.849
"I'm in Paris. I need more men, I.V."

09:21.951 --> 09:23.442
Where did you get this?

09:23.777 --> 09:25.658
The girl... Adelina.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.421
She saw Roland having it written.

09:28.791 --> 09:30.991
It means he was working for someone.

09:31.093 --> 09:32.860
It is confirmed.

09:32.962 --> 09:35.429
Queen Elena's armies have
taken hostages from Sanguesa.

09:35.531 --> 09:36.997
Rally the dukes.

09:37.099 --> 09:39.233
Our troops have to be
mustered within a fortnight.

09:39.335 --> 09:40.434
Two weeks?!

09:40.536 --> 09:42.002
They must leave immediately!

09:42.104 --> 09:44.905
My dear,
to muster an army is no small thing.

09:45.007 --> 09:48.509
You need supplies, horses, grain.

09:48.611 --> 09:50.210
Rest assured, we shall be swift.

09:50.312 --> 09:53.347
Good. In the meantime,
I will set off for Navarre

09:53.449 --> 09:55.215
and start to gather the troops there.

09:55.317 --> 09:56.383
Every able-bodied lad...

09:56.485 --> 09:58.051
"Every able-bodied lad"?

10:01.824 --> 10:03.891
I wasn't aware this was amusing.

10:05.828 --> 10:07.528
This is my homeland.

10:09.723 --> 10:12.733
A battlefield is no place for a woman,

10:12.835 --> 10:15.802
let alone a woman who is with child.

10:15.905 --> 10:18.805
What kind of husband would
I be if I let you go?

10:18.908 --> 10:21.885
What kind of queen would I be
if I did not defend my people?

10:25.180 --> 10:26.480
Excuse my wife.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.916
Her condition has made her excitable.

10:29.018 --> 10:30.817
This has nothing to
do with my condition!

10:30.920 --> 10:33.720
My dear, you have no idea what
the blood of battle is like.

10:33.822 --> 10:35.622
Neither do you.

10:43.499 --> 10:46.342
Escort the queen to her quarters.

10:48.003 --> 10:49.570
Philip,
I will not be sent from the room.

10:49.672 --> 10:51.738
It is for your own good. Guards.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.096
Is the queen awake?

11:16.198 --> 11:17.598
I do not know, Sir.

11:37.177 --> 11:38.476
Dear Lord, bless us.

11:38.578 --> 11:40.445
Bless Jacques, our Grand Master.

11:40.547 --> 11:41.813
Bless Boniface, our Pope.

11:41.915 --> 11:44.575
And may He grant us all Thy wisdom,
amen.

11:44.729 --> 11:46.217
Amen.

11:50.152 --> 11:51.466
Brother Tancrede.

11:51.724 --> 11:53.785
Forgive me, Master,

11:53.888 --> 11:56.053
I am to give the report.

11:56.429 --> 11:58.128
Of course.

11:58.230 --> 12:00.164
Proceed, Brother Anthony.

12:00.266 --> 12:01.632
Thank you, Master.

12:01.734 --> 12:04.768
Our expenditure this
month has fallen to 8,000.

12:04.870 --> 12:10.174
The value of our assets
remains constant at 968,000.

12:10.276 --> 12:13.310
The King's army is almost
ready to defend Navarre.

12:13.412 --> 12:16.547
There are rumors that
in defiance of the king,

12:16.649 --> 12:18.882
Queen Joan has already set off.

12:18.984 --> 12:21.018
The queen has gone to Navarre?

12:21.120 --> 12:23.053
Yes, Master.

12:23.155 --> 12:25.289
As you know, the prisoner Roland

12:25.391 --> 12:29.026
is wanted for more than just
the murder of the Temple Master.

12:29.128 --> 12:31.962
He's wanted for the murder
of a noble family in Genoa

12:32.064 --> 12:33.897
and our brothers in the Temple there

12:33.999 --> 12:36.847
will be collecting him
to face his charges.

12:42.241 --> 12:44.074
I heard about Catalonia's attack.

12:44.176 --> 12:47.044
Have you also heard about
the queen's departure?

12:47.146 --> 12:49.847
This is defiance. This...

12:49.949 --> 12:52.249
utter disregard for my authority.

12:52.351 --> 12:54.485
By God, Landry, I cannot allow it.

12:54.587 --> 12:56.220
I am her husband and her king.

12:56.322 --> 12:57.888
Your Grace, allow me to help.

12:57.990 --> 12:59.823
I can ride out and bring her home.

12:59.925 --> 13:01.658
No need. The matter is in hand.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.886
My governor there,
De Rouvray, he's a good man.

13:05.698 --> 13:08.732
He will see to it that she does
not venture into harm's way.

13:10.603 --> 13:13.437
Oh, I've been so foolish, Landry.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.507
I allowed myself to imagine

13:16.609 --> 13:18.842
that things were improving between us...

13:18.944 --> 13:21.178
That the child was healing our rift.

13:22.715 --> 13:25.249
Forgive me, Your Grace,
but I doubt a child

13:25.351 --> 13:27.451
can heal a marriage with difficulties.

13:31.357 --> 13:32.689
You say you want to help me.

13:32.791 --> 13:34.525
Anything, Your Grace.

13:34.627 --> 13:37.628
In times of strife,
my father would sneak out of the palace

13:37.730 --> 13:40.230
dressed as a commoner to
walk among the people.

13:40.332 --> 13:42.799
And you wish to walk
among the people now?

13:42.902 --> 13:44.401
No.

13:45.114 --> 13:47.271
I wish to drink.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.874
Drink or be gone.

13:50.976 --> 13:52.609
I'm the Temple Master.

13:52.711 --> 13:54.044
Drunkenness is frowned upon.

13:54.146 --> 13:55.479
Not tonight.

13:55.581 --> 13:57.314
Tonight you're not a monk,
and I'm not a king.

13:57.416 --> 14:00.150
Now drink. To my miserable marriage.

14:02.521 --> 14:05.088
She thinks I'm a coward, you know?

14:05.191 --> 14:08.158
She accused me of never
fighting in a battle.

14:08.260 --> 14:11.562
A king has to strategize
from a proper distance...

14:11.664 --> 14:16.166
you know, in... in order to
observe the whole battlefield.

14:18.037 --> 14:20.270
Who am I fooling?

14:20.372 --> 14:23.173
A true leader fights shoulder
to shoulder with his men,

14:23.275 --> 14:25.075
as you Templars do.

14:25.177 --> 14:27.244
I have not done this.

14:27.346 --> 14:28.812
Philip,
you can't blame yourself for that.

14:28.914 --> 14:30.847
Well, who then can I blame?

14:30.950 --> 14:32.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:32.685 --> 14:34.451
- Hey.
- Philip? Philip!

14:34.553 --> 14:37.421
Let it go. Come on.

14:37.523 --> 14:39.690
I always let it go.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.358
You, there!

14:43.629 --> 14:45.762
I suggest you buy me another.

14:45.864 --> 14:48.966
And I suggest you suck my rod.

14:54.073 --> 14:55.505
His sword is buckled to his right.

14:55.608 --> 14:56.974
He's gonna swing with his left.

14:57.076 --> 15:00.310
You duck,
then you hit him with all you've got.

15:00.412 --> 15:02.145
All right?

15:05.618 --> 15:07.184
Come on, lovely boy!

15:18.297 --> 15:19.630
I saw.

15:28.774 --> 15:30.374
Who do you work for?

15:31.777 --> 15:32.909
Aaah!

15:34.913 --> 15:37.180
Enough!

15:38.350 --> 15:40.884
What do you think you are doing?!

15:40.986 --> 15:43.687
Roland had this letter written
before he was arrested.

15:43.789 --> 15:45.889
At the end, it says "I.V."

15:45.991 --> 15:47.891
I know that could be
two letters or a number,

15:47.993 --> 15:49.893
but we need to tell our Master...

15:49.995 --> 15:52.596
Roland is no longer our concern.

15:52.698 --> 15:55.932
The Temple in Genoa is sending
knights to collect him.

15:56.035 --> 15:57.934
Roland is wanted for crimes there,

15:58.037 --> 15:59.770
and there he will face justice.

15:59.872 --> 16:01.605
Oh, no! What could be more important

16:01.707 --> 16:03.206
than killing a Temple Master?

16:03.309 --> 16:05.108
He should stay here in Paris.

16:05.210 --> 16:07.911
It's not Godfrey's death
you seek to avenge, is it?

16:09.048 --> 16:10.947
It's Marie's.

16:11.050 --> 16:14.584
Parsifal, you must submit to God.

16:15.133 --> 16:18.955
Only then will you be
worthy of being a Templar.

16:19.513 --> 16:22.459
Will you submit to him?

16:23.018 --> 16:24.428
Yes, sir.

16:24.873 --> 16:26.229
I will.

16:38.377 --> 16:40.243
Extraordinary, wasn't it?

16:40.346 --> 16:41.611
It's extraordinary that
you walked out of there

16:41.714 --> 16:43.080
with only a bloody lip.

16:43.182 --> 16:45.549
Oh, it felt so good not to hold back,
huh?

16:45.651 --> 16:47.484
To have free rein.

16:49.588 --> 16:52.255
Ah, free rein.

16:52.830 --> 16:54.376
What is it?

16:55.994 --> 16:59.129
It takes setting aside the crown
to see things more clearly.

17:00.144 --> 17:03.633
In the end, it is those closest to you

17:03.736 --> 17:05.801
who will betray you.

17:06.431 --> 17:08.338
De Nogaret.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.441
You were warned about De Nogaret.

17:12.911 --> 17:15.078
It's right under my nose. I just...

17:17.383 --> 17:19.316
I just couldn't see it.

17:21.686 --> 17:24.354
Everyone lies to the king.

17:26.297 --> 17:29.826
Sometimes I think you're the
only friend I've got, Landry.

17:29.928 --> 17:32.596
Never betray my trust.

17:47.710 --> 17:50.013
I remember you were a noble...

17:50.115 --> 17:52.649
before joining the Temple.

17:53.194 --> 17:54.766
What was your name?

17:55.888 --> 18:00.457
My given name was Audric,
the second Lord of Bonnechere.

18:03.829 --> 18:06.062
Have you ever been with a woman?

18:06.165 --> 18:10.200
Uh, a few... before my oath.

18:12.571 --> 18:14.905
You smell of ale.

18:15.007 --> 18:16.640
You've been drinking.

18:16.742 --> 18:18.375
Did you ever want any children?

18:18.477 --> 18:21.077
A third Lord of Bonnechere?

18:21.786 --> 18:23.770
I suppose.

18:24.131 --> 18:26.416
When I heard God's call,
then I answered.

18:26.518 --> 18:30.263
It is possible to hear
God's call and ignore it.

18:31.758 --> 18:33.757
Landry?

18:33.859 --> 18:35.829
What have you done?

18:41.633 --> 18:42.933
Who is she?

18:43.035 --> 18:44.367
It no longer matters.

18:44.470 --> 18:47.370
I gave her up for this
search for the Grail.

18:48.774 --> 18:51.575
But I still can't get
her out of my heart.

18:51.677 --> 18:54.277
If it's over, then let it be over.

18:56.281 --> 18:57.781
She's having my child.

19:00.786 --> 19:03.687
Another man will raise
that child as his own.

19:03.789 --> 19:05.689
Jesus' name, Landry!

19:05.791 --> 19:08.091
I must resign as master.

19:08.193 --> 19:11.261
You cannot resign before
finding the Grail.

19:11.363 --> 19:12.462
The Grail is dust.

19:12.564 --> 19:14.231
If God intended for us to have it,

19:14.333 --> 19:16.766
we would have found
something at the orphanage.

19:16.869 --> 19:19.536
He's testing your faith. You must forget

19:19.638 --> 19:22.739
this woman and the child
and resume the search.

19:22.841 --> 19:25.057
I never knew my parents.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.111
And their absence haunted me.

19:28.510 --> 19:31.448
The idea that I would inflict
that same pain on a child...

19:31.550 --> 19:34.084
Look at me. I am wracked with pain.

19:35.670 --> 19:38.455
All you've ever known is this.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.625
What do you know about being a father?

19:41.727 --> 19:44.494
I know enough not to abandon my child.

19:44.596 --> 19:47.063
Turn your back on the Grail,

19:47.165 --> 19:49.299
and you will be abandoning God.

19:49.401 --> 19:53.970
No, Brother,
it is God who keeps abandoning me.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.794
I took something he
believed belonged to his people.

20:38.896 --> 20:40.362
Is that what's in your box?

20:40.465 --> 20:42.737
Never mention that box again.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.979
Understand?

20:49.006 --> 20:50.973
You.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.575
What are you doing here?

20:52.677 --> 20:55.244
Looking for a handsome lad like you...

20:55.346 --> 20:56.912
Landry.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.817
How do you know my name?

21:02.280 --> 21:05.254
I heard the cripple
say it in the street.

21:07.845 --> 21:10.292
You know something, don't you?

21:10.834 --> 21:13.596
You want to know who
burnt down the orphanage.

21:15.009 --> 21:16.799
It wasn't a child.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.801
And it wasn't an accident.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.102
Who was it?

21:20.394 --> 21:22.138
Me.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.181
Brother Gawain.

21:32.283 --> 21:33.816
This was a mistake.

21:33.918 --> 21:37.353
Believe me, I know what it is
like to be on the inside...

21:37.455 --> 21:39.522
and yet to feel so alone.

21:40.558 --> 21:41.690
Tell me.

21:45.196 --> 21:47.374
Landry has broken his vows.

21:47.580 --> 21:49.204
Master "holier than thou" Landry?

21:49.358 --> 21:54.003
He's been with a married woman,
one who bears his child.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.372
Even when he demoted me,
I respected his decision

21:56.474 --> 21:58.874
because he was the best one
to lead us after Godfrey.

21:59.331 --> 22:00.464
And now?

22:00.542 --> 22:02.611
Does he still deserve your loyalty?

22:02.713 --> 22:04.947
He's the only one who
can find the Grail,

22:05.049 --> 22:06.816
so, yes, I remain loyal to him.

22:07.658 --> 22:09.718
Tell me something...

22:09.821 --> 22:13.656
If Landry found the Grail,
would he let you drink from it?

22:14.099 --> 22:16.725
Yes. He knows how much I suffer.

22:17.346 --> 22:18.892
He's not fallen that far.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.629
He would not deny me that.

22:20.731 --> 22:23.699
Your master seems to deny
everyone but himself.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.135
And if you think he would deny you,

22:26.237 --> 22:28.237
then you must ask yourself...

22:28.684 --> 22:30.706
how much does it mean to you

22:30.808 --> 22:34.210
to have a chance of
drinking from the Grail?

22:34.585 --> 22:36.579
And how far would you be willing to go?

22:36.681 --> 22:37.847
What do you mean?

22:37.949 --> 22:39.348
Oh, I...

22:39.450 --> 22:41.310
I merely raise the question.

22:47.546 --> 22:49.273
Halt!

22:50.947 --> 22:52.597
What is it?

22:52.803 --> 22:54.864
Navarre, Your Grace.

23:15.119 --> 23:17.553
Why did you burn down the orphanage?

23:17.655 --> 23:19.889
I'd like some wine, please.

23:19.991 --> 23:22.691
I know you monks have
the good stuff here.

23:22.793 --> 23:24.803
Claret.

23:34.572 --> 23:35.804
Now ask your questions.

23:35.907 --> 23:36.888
Why did you burn it down?

23:36.914 --> 23:40.876
It's what Godfrey instructed me to do,
if he should be killed.

23:41.913 --> 23:44.079
Anyone getting as far as the orphanage

23:44.181 --> 23:46.148
was to believe they were too late.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.451
So the Grail is not lost.

23:51.785 --> 23:54.256
Why did you not say something before?

23:54.358 --> 23:58.227
Because what I say is
meant for your ears only.

23:58.329 --> 24:02.464
All of these men around you,
once you have the Grail,

24:02.566 --> 24:04.833
they will all try to take it from you.

24:04.936 --> 24:06.835
You can't trust any of them...

24:06.938 --> 24:10.105
Not the Turcopole,
not your friend the King,

24:10.207 --> 24:12.322
and certainly not the cripple.

24:33.397 --> 24:34.849
Your Grace.

24:34.952 --> 24:38.367
I am Governor De Rouvray.
Welcome to Navarre.

24:41.238 --> 24:42.805
What is Queen Elena's position?

24:42.907 --> 24:44.873
She is camped five leagues to the east.

24:46.410 --> 24:48.177
And the Merinos are convening here?

24:48.279 --> 24:49.445
Yes, Your Grace.

24:49.547 --> 24:51.814
Good. I wish to speak with them.

24:51.916 --> 24:54.116
Are you certain, Your Grace?

24:54.218 --> 24:55.551
Of course.

24:55.653 --> 24:57.319
I must speak with the nobles.

24:57.421 --> 24:59.221
As you wish.

24:59.323 --> 25:02.358
But be warned...
they may not wish to speak with you.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.232
- Who's this?
- From the Temple in Genoa,

25:10.334 --> 25:12.201
sent to collect the prisoner.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.511
You're not supposed to be out here.

25:42.665 --> 25:45.089
Why? Am I prisoner?

25:45.191 --> 25:47.922
I don't know what you are to come here,
telling me my brothers can't be trusted.

25:48.025 --> 25:50.895
- They can't.
- But you can be?

25:51.401 --> 25:54.564
Whom to trust? Tricky, isn't it?

25:54.696 --> 25:58.202
If I had wanted to kill you,
I would have done it at the orphanage.

25:58.304 --> 25:59.885
Or I could do it now.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.831
Your throat would be cut
the moment you tried.

26:01.913 --> 26:03.513
You're feeding the wrong one.

26:03.612 --> 26:07.645
The black wolf and the white wolf,
you're feeding the wrong one.

26:07.747 --> 26:08.892
You know that story?

26:08.975 --> 26:12.216
Oh, you think you're
the only person he told.

26:13.015 --> 26:15.366
Of all people, you can trust me.

26:15.505 --> 26:18.506
I am the clue that
Godfrey meant you to find.

26:18.608 --> 26:21.352
- I'll take you to the Grail.
- You know where it is?

26:21.517 --> 26:24.145
- Where?
- You'll see.

26:24.247 --> 26:26.581
We set off in the morning.

26:32.622 --> 26:34.422
Hey, what's going on?

26:34.524 --> 26:36.090
Where are you going? Oi!

26:36.192 --> 26:38.726
No messing! You have to get me to Genoa!

26:40.964 --> 26:43.564
Oi, I'm talking to you!

26:58.335 --> 27:01.516
It's time to make your penance.

27:29.312 --> 27:32.714
I've never talked, lad,
and I'm not starting now.

27:32.816 --> 27:35.316
So don't waste your time.

27:42.004 --> 27:44.492
Tell me who you work for,
and I'll let you find peace.

27:44.594 --> 27:48.414
Or die a sinner
with no forgiveness.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.833
Listen to me.

27:51.935 --> 27:54.168
You don't want to know who it is.

27:54.270 --> 27:57.739
I met Marie when I was 13 years old.

27:59.342 --> 28:02.199
She was the most beautiful
thing I ever saw.

28:02.562 --> 28:04.262
You don't know these people.

28:05.832 --> 28:06.965
Who is it?

28:07.067 --> 28:08.333
They'll kill you.

28:08.435 --> 28:10.235
I don't care.

28:10.337 --> 28:12.303
Now tell me.

28:12.406 --> 28:14.272
What's his name?

28:14.374 --> 28:16.675
Who are you working for?

28:16.777 --> 28:18.610
No mercies...

28:18.712 --> 28:20.645
no mercy...

28:20.747 --> 28:22.914
thy will be done...

28:36.530 --> 28:38.263
Oh.

28:47.374 --> 28:49.441
Lord...

28:49.543 --> 28:51.142
hear me...

28:51.244 --> 28:52.544
I beg.

28:52.646 --> 28:54.279
There's no one listening.

28:54.381 --> 28:55.680
In the name of Jesus!

28:55.782 --> 28:58.116
There's no one listening!

28:58.218 --> 28:59.217
No!

29:01.888 --> 29:03.988
You trust her?

29:05.592 --> 29:07.619
I have no alternative.

29:08.166 --> 29:11.033
If she does lead us to the Grail...

29:11.194 --> 29:15.300
if we do find it,
would you allow me to drink from it?

29:16.570 --> 29:19.637
Gawain, you told me we must
bear the pain God gives us.

29:19.740 --> 29:21.339
This is different.

29:22.442 --> 29:24.709
Godfrey himself used the
Cup to heal his brother.

29:24.811 --> 29:26.511
Godfrey had the Grail since Acre.

29:26.613 --> 29:28.246
If he thought you should use it,

29:28.348 --> 29:29.914
he would have given it to you.

29:30.016 --> 29:33.685
The Grail is meant to heal the world...

29:33.787 --> 29:35.253
not you or me.

29:35.355 --> 29:36.421
Gawain?

29:36.523 --> 29:38.723
It is easy for you to say.

29:38.825 --> 29:40.925
You have not lost as much as I have.

29:41.027 --> 29:41.926
I haven't?

29:42.028 --> 29:43.839
Are you sure?

29:45.365 --> 29:46.664
If you value our friendship,

29:46.767 --> 29:48.433
you'll never ask this of me again.

30:00.514 --> 30:03.882
Six hours on the cross.

30:04.590 --> 30:06.551
Then death.

30:06.653 --> 30:09.554
And the resurrection.

30:09.656 --> 30:12.056
Your suffering was greater than mine.

30:12.159 --> 30:14.425
But at least yours ended quickly.

30:14.528 --> 30:16.594
Every step...

30:16.696 --> 30:21.933
every waking moment is agony untold.

30:23.403 --> 30:25.737
Every time I ride a horse,

30:25.839 --> 30:28.740
every time I draw a sword,

30:28.842 --> 30:31.376
and I can show none of it.

30:31.478 --> 30:35.446
Lord, I know I am a Judas.

30:35.549 --> 30:39.951
I have lived with the
guilt of my betrayals.

30:40.053 --> 30:42.453
But now I find our master,

30:42.556 --> 30:45.790
your chosen one, is a vile sinner.

30:45.892 --> 30:48.827
And still he can do no wrong.

30:48.929 --> 30:50.995
I have kept my vows,

30:51.097 --> 30:54.632
and now you show me that
those vows are worthless?

30:58.438 --> 31:00.271
Oh.

31:00.373 --> 31:02.273
I see.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.309
This is your plan for me.

31:04.411 --> 31:08.913
You have burdened me with
this because it is my destiny.

31:09.015 --> 31:13.451
You needed Judas to betray Jesus,
and you need me.

31:13.553 --> 31:16.788
It is your will that Landry
not give me the Grail

31:16.890 --> 31:20.792
because you want me to take it from him.

31:20.894 --> 31:23.494
And take it I will!

31:27.331 --> 31:29.931
Why is the cripple here?

31:30.033 --> 31:31.533
He's my brother.

31:31.635 --> 31:33.201
I trust him with my life.

31:41.278 --> 31:43.578
Our scouts...

31:43.680 --> 31:47.115
Our scouts say Queen Elena's army...

31:47.217 --> 31:50.218
sits 4,000 strong, ready to invade.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.420
How many troops can you raise?

31:51.522 --> 31:54.022
1,000 men, 400 horses.

31:54.124 --> 31:57.025
Do not forget France's reinforcements,
my Lords.

31:57.127 --> 31:59.361
And where are France's reinforcements?

31:59.463 --> 32:02.731
Did Your Grace bring the
French army in under her dress?

32:03.826 --> 32:06.201
My husband, your king,

32:06.303 --> 32:09.104
was mustering thousands
of troops when I left.

32:09.206 --> 32:12.040
You have my word,
reinforcements are coming.

32:12.142 --> 32:13.642
Your word?

32:13.744 --> 32:15.043
And who are you?

32:15.145 --> 32:18.246
This is not your home...
Nor has it ever been.

32:20.805 --> 32:24.052
Navarre is where my
family have been born

32:24.154 --> 32:26.288
and buried for 400 years.

32:26.390 --> 32:28.390
You are a Merino.

32:28.492 --> 32:30.759
My grandfather, Theobald,
gave you that title.

32:30.861 --> 32:34.030
You have your noble lands
because my family bestowed them!

32:34.648 --> 32:38.300
It is true that I do not know
this country as well as I wish.

32:38.402 --> 32:40.626
But I know my cousin.

32:41.171 --> 32:42.404
Once she learns I'm here

32:42.506 --> 32:43.972
and the army of France is behind me,

32:44.074 --> 32:45.474
she will back down.

32:47.611 --> 32:49.478
Make way!

32:49.580 --> 32:51.603
Clear a path!

32:52.516 --> 32:55.250
A delivery has arrived for her Grace.

32:55.352 --> 32:58.854
A gift from Queen Elena of Catalonia.

33:11.679 --> 33:14.336
Send a message to Queen Elena.

33:14.438 --> 33:16.771
Tell her I wish to parley.

33:23.788 --> 33:25.814
I know what you're thinking.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.315
It won't work.

33:27.417 --> 33:28.478
What?

33:28.581 --> 33:31.553
Draw your sword against him,
and he'll kill you.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.357
Why would I draw my
sword against my master?

33:35.459 --> 33:37.359
I don't know.

33:38.270 --> 33:42.083
Why would you draw your
sword against your master?

34:25.197 --> 34:27.108
Mother Superior.

34:31.304 --> 34:33.415
I don't understand.

34:33.516 --> 34:38.018
Landry, it was always my
privilege to care for you.

34:38.121 --> 34:41.889
And you have grown into the
man I knew you would become.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.626
I'm very happy to see you.

34:53.025 --> 34:55.088
This is as far as I'll go.

36:34.581 --> 36:37.286
That's it?

36:37.493 --> 36:41.100
15 years I've waited for this moment.

37:01.874 --> 37:03.908
I thought you would have
waited till the ride home.

37:04.010 --> 37:05.276
I'm taking the Grail

37:05.378 --> 37:06.810
because you were never
going to give it to me.

37:06.913 --> 37:08.312
Is this really about the Grail?

37:08.414 --> 37:10.147
I am crippled because
of my loyalty to you.

37:10.249 --> 37:11.749
You are crippled
because it's God's will.

37:11.851 --> 37:14.285
Do not speak to me of God's will.

37:14.387 --> 37:17.524
Was it his will that you took
a woman from her husband?

37:17.782 --> 37:20.307
Is it His will that you've
abandoned your child?

37:20.410 --> 37:23.260
- Don't push me, Brother.
- You are no brother of mine.

37:23.786 --> 37:26.156
You're not fit to be a Templar.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.934
You're a hypocrite.

37:28.063 --> 37:30.124
And you're a liar.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.964
You gave Tancrede over to the Saracens
knowing what they would do to him.

37:38.627 --> 37:41.595
You're our master, our leader,

37:41.697 --> 37:45.499
and you spat on every
value we hold dear.

37:45.601 --> 37:48.575
You hate yourself more than
you could ever hate me.

37:48.885 --> 37:51.436
Your leg is the least of your problems.

37:54.643 --> 37:55.942
Draw your sword.

37:56.045 --> 37:57.044
No.

37:57.146 --> 37:58.812
Defend yourself.

38:01.650 --> 38:04.217
Oh! Oh!

38:19.768 --> 38:21.401
Gawain...

38:22.671 --> 38:24.738
Don't make me kill you.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.073
I'm a better Templar than you.

38:26.175 --> 38:27.307
I'm a better man than you.

38:49.298 --> 38:51.231
Do it.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.333
This cup has made madmen of us all.

38:53.850 --> 38:55.902
You are a better Templar than me.

38:56.004 --> 38:58.605
Because if I was a better Templar,

38:58.707 --> 39:00.657
I would kill you.

39:13.989 --> 39:16.723
There you go. Enjoy it while you can.

39:16.825 --> 39:19.426
We'll all be starving when war comes.

39:20.318 --> 39:22.095
War with whom, England?

39:23.204 --> 39:24.776
Where have you been?

39:24.956 --> 39:26.600
Catalonia.

39:26.702 --> 39:29.102
The queen rode out of
Paris and into battle.

39:29.204 --> 39:30.909
And with child.

39:31.295 --> 39:32.706
The queen is with child?

39:32.808 --> 39:34.708
Five months or so, they say.

39:34.810 --> 39:37.531
Then there'll be another
prince or princess,

39:37.711 --> 39:40.914
then taxes will go up... Again.

39:41.016 --> 39:42.916
Royal bastards.

39:51.693 --> 39:55.131
Landry has been with a married woman.

39:56.031 --> 39:58.352
One who bears his child.

40:00.068 --> 40:02.669
To Landry,
our new Temple Master.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.143
A royal bastard indeed.

40:14.783 --> 40:16.752
Congratulations.

40:16.958 --> 40:19.019
These sisters have kept
the secret of the Grail

40:19.121 --> 40:20.754
for 15 years.

40:20.856 --> 40:22.889
Thank you. The Pope himself
will hear of your service.

40:22.991 --> 40:25.926
No, wait! The cripple?

40:27.696 --> 40:29.262
You were right.

40:29.364 --> 40:31.078
Is he dead?

40:33.063 --> 40:34.034
I will deal with him.

40:34.136 --> 40:36.803
No. When he wakes, you let him go.

40:36.905 --> 40:40.340
He's a broken man,
and we are still Christians.

40:40.442 --> 40:42.843
There are things now that you must do.

40:42.945 --> 40:45.045
You must take the Grail
to a new safe place.

40:45.147 --> 40:47.547
There are places Godfrey
had prepared for this day.

40:47.649 --> 40:49.382
No. No more hiding places.

40:49.485 --> 40:51.318
- I will take it to the Temple.
- No.

40:51.420 --> 40:52.547
And from there,
I will take it to the Pope.

40:52.676 --> 40:53.939
No.

40:55.991 --> 40:58.886
The Temple is not safe
for you or the Grail.

40:59.595 --> 41:02.062
The Temple is the safest place
for me and for the Grail.

41:05.938 --> 41:07.901
I'm gonna have to go with you.

41:08.308 --> 41:09.416
Why?

41:09.623 --> 41:11.738
Because you're making a mistake.
Because...

41:14.080 --> 41:16.843
Because this will be the death of you.

41:16.945 --> 41:18.770
And because...

41:19.801 --> 41:21.748
I'm your mother.

41:37.740 --> 41:39.499
Pierre.

41:46.642 --> 41:48.174
Where's the master?

41:48.277 --> 41:49.376
Is he back yet?

41:49.478 --> 41:50.610
No, why? What's happened?

41:50.712 --> 41:53.747
It's Roland. I took him from the Temple.

41:55.117 --> 41:56.383
I killed him.

41:57.993 --> 42:00.287
Parsifal,
why would you do that?

42:00.389 --> 42:03.723
It doesn't matter.
I know who he's working for.

42:04.860 --> 42:06.860
You do? You know?

42:06.962 --> 42:10.130
He told me.
And it means we cannot trust anyone.

42:10.232 --> 42:12.681
I need to warn Landr...
