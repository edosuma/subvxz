WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:03.297
If we don't do something,

00:03.298 --> 00:04.514
the restaurant is done.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.769
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:05.770 --> 00:07.734
I fell in love with a married man.

00:07.768 --> 00:09.301
That was the first crime I committed.

00:09.336 --> 00:11.270
I believe Elizabeth Grey ended his life.

00:11.304 --> 00:13.039
Did you cancel with my friend

00:13.073 --> 00:14.907
so that you could go
have sex with your boss?

00:14.942 --> 00:17.043
What kind of person does that?

00:17.077 --> 00:18.343
Lucy!

00:18.377 --> 00:19.678
Try to stay calm, Mrs. Malloy.

00:19.712 --> 00:21.579
I'll be right back. We're gonna find her.

00:24.350 --> 00:25.651
April, what are you doing here?

00:25.685 --> 00:26.852
Where is she?

00:26.886 --> 00:28.219
Where's who? Slow down.

00:28.254 --> 00:30.122
Lucy! I know you took her.

00:30.156 --> 00:31.690
Lucy? I don't have Lucy.

00:31.724 --> 00:33.491
Stop lying to me, you son of a bitch!

00:33.526 --> 00:34.659
Where is my daughter?

00:34.693 --> 00:36.694
I don't have her.

00:36.728 --> 00:38.929
April, I don't have Lucy.

00:42.134 --> 00:44.669
Then Miranda. Miranda took her.

00:44.703 --> 00:47.204
- Miranda's in Florida with Scottie.
- Really?

00:47.238 --> 00:48.773
She called me from the
landline this morning.

00:48.807 --> 00:49.974
I know she's there.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.642
April, talk to me. What
the hell is going on?

00:51.676 --> 00:52.842
I don't know.

00:52.877 --> 00:54.077
I don't... I don't... I don't know.

00:54.111 --> 00:56.413
I don't know where she
is. I can't find Lucy.

01:21.064 --> 01:24.866
Frankly, I'm not sure what
we're doing here today.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.234
Well, uh, Your Honor,

01:26.268 --> 01:28.970
this is in regards to the
matter of Grey vs. Kim.

01:29.004 --> 01:30.839
Thank you for stating
the obvious, Mr. Taylor.

01:30.873 --> 01:33.575
What I meant was, I see no case here.

01:33.609 --> 01:35.844
I've examined these depositions,

01:35.878 --> 01:37.779
and the only thing that seems irrefutable

01:37.813 --> 01:40.581
is that Thomas Grey was seriously ill.

01:40.615 --> 01:43.817
The amount of lost earnings
you claim here is negligible.

01:43.852 --> 01:46.053
As to whether or not Dr. Kim was present

01:46.088 --> 01:47.355
at the time of his death,

01:47.389 --> 01:49.690
the evidence is circumstantial at best.

01:49.724 --> 01:51.392
Isn't that for a jury to decide?

01:51.426 --> 01:52.994
Actually, it isn't.

01:53.028 --> 01:55.328
I have no intention of
wasting this court's time

01:55.363 --> 01:58.598
on what I perceive to
be a frivolous lawsuit.

01:58.632 --> 02:00.267
Case dismissed.

02:06.073 --> 02:07.840
That's it? It's over?

02:07.875 --> 02:09.142
Were you hoping for more?

02:12.078 --> 02:15.281
Thank you. Thank you so much.

02:19.652 --> 02:20.920
Ooh.

02:24.891 --> 02:26.058
Oh, no.

02:28.593 --> 02:30.828
Can someone get that, please?

02:35.234 --> 02:36.367
Hello?

02:36.402 --> 02:37.535
We lost.

02:37.569 --> 02:40.571
Oh, my God, that is fantastic.

02:40.605 --> 02:44.408
I mean, I mean, I'm so
sorry. That really sucks.

02:44.442 --> 02:46.743
Go ahead and do your little
happy dance now so that

02:46.777 --> 02:48.145
when we get back to the office,

02:48.179 --> 02:50.580
you can act depressed with the rest of us.

02:50.614 --> 02:51.881
You're already dancing, aren't you?

02:51.916 --> 02:53.216
Maybe a little bit,

02:53.251 --> 02:54.384
But I promise I will mope it up

02:54.419 --> 02:55.852
once you guys get back to the office.

02:57.121 --> 03:00.056
Hey, is there anyone out there?

03:00.090 --> 03:01.357
Dom, I gotta go.

03:01.391 --> 03:03.559
I think all the assistants
have left the building.

03:03.593 --> 03:05.194
All right.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.495
Bye. Oh.

03:10.367 --> 03:11.900
You answered. It's a miracle.

03:11.935 --> 03:13.069
Jeff.

03:13.103 --> 03:14.370
Hi.

03:14.404 --> 03:16.471
Uh, I'm sorry. I was
just... I was really swamped.

03:16.505 --> 03:17.838
Well, between you and your husband,

03:17.873 --> 03:19.574
neither one of you knows
how to return a call.

03:19.608 --> 03:20.775
You'd think I was

03:20.809 --> 03:22.510
an auditor instead of
your business manager.

03:22.545 --> 03:24.279
What can I do you for?

03:24.313 --> 03:27.282
Well, I'm not sure how much
Harry's already told you, but...

03:27.316 --> 03:29.150
Assume he's told me nothing.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.348
Oh, well, uh, I hate to
do this over the phone,

03:34.382 --> 03:36.283
but I need an answer as soon as possible.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.051
About what?

03:38.085 --> 03:40.153
About whether or not you wanna
close down the restaurant.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.561
Come in!

03:48.595 --> 03:50.062
Last time, I promise.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.365
Oh, what is it, Harry? I'm late.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.633
Blue hoodie.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.200
Pretty sure it was in
the dry cleaning basket.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.169
If not, it's on the floor of the closet

03:57.203 --> 03:59.405
or possibly under the bed.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.406
Dude, I have to get to Alex's

04:00.440 --> 04:02.074
before she leaves for class, okay?

04:02.108 --> 04:03.308
Can't you just get it yourself?

04:03.342 --> 04:05.143
I am not stepping foot back in that house.

04:05.177 --> 04:06.144
Oh, my God.

04:06.178 --> 04:08.045
You've got to get over it, okay?

04:08.080 --> 04:09.947
I'm telling you, that guy has
never been back to this house.

04:09.982 --> 04:11.483
You don't know that, Joss.

04:11.517 --> 04:12.850
I do know that, Harry.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.453
The only person sleeping in
Savi's bed right now is me.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.454
Nice mattress, by the way.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.223
Oh, the memory foam is amaze-balls.

04:21.926 --> 04:23.827
I'll live without the hoodie.

04:23.861 --> 04:25.663
Harry.

04:26.864 --> 04:29.099
Is there someone I can e-mail a picture to?

04:29.133 --> 04:30.801
I can do it on my phone.

04:33.938 --> 04:36.272
Okay, thank you, officer.

04:36.307 --> 04:37.507
Oh, shoot.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.175
Did you try any of the
parents in her class?

04:39.209 --> 04:40.910
I mean, maybe she went to a friend's house

04:40.944 --> 04:42.745
- and didn't tell you.
- No, but she knew we were going out together.

04:42.780 --> 04:43.913
We had a plan.

04:43.947 --> 04:45.581
Maybe she forgot.

04:45.616 --> 04:47.417
Take me home.

04:53.290 --> 04:54.957
I'm late for work.

04:54.991 --> 04:56.792
Yeah, I know.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.095
You're seriously not even gonna talk to me?

05:00.130 --> 05:01.263
There's nothing to talk about.

05:01.298 --> 05:03.598
Alex, come on. It was one mistake,

05:03.633 --> 05:05.600
which wasn't even a mistake technically,

05:05.635 --> 05:07.303
- considering we...
- Joss, I'm not doing this.

05:09.205 --> 05:11.840
It's not worth it.

05:11.874 --> 05:13.808
Wow. Thanks a lot.

05:13.843 --> 05:17.045
No. No. You do not get to be hurt.

05:17.079 --> 05:18.479
Of course I'm hurt.

05:18.513 --> 05:20.414
Alex, you're throwing away
our entire relationship. Why?

05:20.449 --> 05:21.782
I was not the one who threw it away.

05:21.817 --> 05:24.517
You did that all by yourself.

05:29.357 --> 05:31.258
Will you please just ta...

05:43.676 --> 05:45.911
Stay here.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.646
I'll text you if she's inside.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.148
Okay.

05:57.323 --> 05:58.689
Lucy!

06:00.292 --> 06:02.060
Lucy, are you here?

06:02.094 --> 06:04.962
Lucy!

06:53.141 --> 06:54.875
Hey.

06:54.909 --> 06:55.876
Come here.

06:55.910 --> 06:58.079
Come here. Come here.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.381
Come here.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.850
It's okay.

07:03.885 --> 07:05.252
It's okay.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.191
Yes? Hello?

07:11.225 --> 07:14.427
Oh, my God. Thank God.

07:14.462 --> 07:16.329
What? What?

07:16.363 --> 07:17.997
It's the police. They found Lucy.

07:18.031 --> 07:20.700
Oh, thank God.

07:26.987 --> 07:29.588
So should I come down there now or...

07:29.622 --> 07:31.189
Right, okay.

07:31.224 --> 07:33.492
Thank you so much, officer.

07:33.526 --> 07:36.595
She's at the police
station in Santa Monica.

07:36.629 --> 07:37.863
Santa Monica?

07:37.897 --> 07:40.598
Apparently, she took
the bus down to the pier.

07:40.632 --> 07:42.467
I don't even know how she
knew which one to get on.

07:42.501 --> 07:43.634
- Why?
- I don't know.

07:43.669 --> 07:45.470
Uh, all I know is that they have her,

07:45.504 --> 07:48.272
and they're bringing her back now, so...

07:48.306 --> 07:51.308
I'm leaving. But, April, please...

07:51.343 --> 07:52.777
I'll call you.

07:56.748 --> 07:59.350
I promise.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.621
Hey.

08:04.655 --> 08:07.024
I called you this morning.
Did you get my message?

08:07.058 --> 08:09.260
Yeah. I've been with patients all day.

08:09.294 --> 08:10.427
I haven't had a second.

08:10.461 --> 08:12.061
Oh, good. You're both here.

08:12.096 --> 08:13.596
I'm actually on my way out the door. Uh...

08:13.630 --> 08:15.798
This'll just take a minute.

08:15.832 --> 08:17.800
I couldn't let this entire day pass

08:17.834 --> 08:20.036
without celebrating Dr.
Kim's acquittal, so...

08:20.070 --> 08:21.504
There was never a trial, Lila.

08:21.538 --> 08:24.107
Dismissal, acquittal, either way...

08:24.141 --> 08:27.609
You won. Cheers, Dr. Kim.

08:27.643 --> 08:30.145
I know I speak for all of us when I say,

08:30.179 --> 08:31.579
whew, what a relief.

08:36.953 --> 08:39.354
Ahh. I'm, uh, I'm sorry I can't stay.

08:39.389 --> 08:41.323
I have a dinner.

08:41.357 --> 08:43.357
Congratulations, Karen.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.259
Thank you.

08:45.294 --> 08:47.028
I just can't believe you
were put through all this.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.790
Thanks, Lila, but I have to go, too.

08:49.824 --> 08:51.092
Have a nice night.

08:52.294 --> 08:53.860
Oh.

08:53.895 --> 08:55.729
Doctor's office.

08:55.763 --> 08:56.930
Dr. Kim?

08:58.967 --> 09:02.135
It's a Dr. Josh Burke from
the state licensing board.

09:02.169 --> 09:03.903
He says he wants a meeting with you.

09:07.868 --> 09:10.069
I've been trying to talk to
Harry about it for weeks now,

09:10.103 --> 09:11.837
but he refuses to engage.

09:11.872 --> 09:13.506
What exactly is the problem?

09:13.540 --> 09:15.141
We're hemorrhaging money.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.709
I need 25 grand to stop the bleeding.

09:17.744 --> 09:21.012
After that, I can focus on
fixing what isn't working,

09:21.046 --> 09:23.181
starting with our marketing strategy.

09:23.215 --> 09:25.350
Why don't you just hire a publicist?

09:25.385 --> 09:27.519
I wanted to. Your husband refused.

09:27.553 --> 09:30.054
Clearly, I should be
talking to you about this.

09:30.089 --> 09:31.322
No, no, no, no, no.

09:31.356 --> 09:33.724
These are all his decisions to make.

09:33.759 --> 09:35.393
You know, it's his restaurant.

09:35.427 --> 09:37.795
Yeah, but it's... your investment.

09:37.829 --> 09:39.730
Restaurants are a risky business.

09:39.765 --> 09:41.098
We knew that going in.

09:41.132 --> 09:43.401
Obviously, this is more
than a business investment.

09:43.435 --> 09:45.936
This is your life here,
your... your husband's dream.

09:45.970 --> 09:48.505
We split up, Jeff.

09:48.539 --> 09:50.407
What?

09:50.441 --> 09:52.642
We're separated.

09:52.677 --> 09:56.212
So you can stop calling him
my husband every five minutes.

09:56.246 --> 09:59.215
It's kind of killin' me.

09:59.249 --> 10:00.583
Savi, I'm so sorry.

10:00.618 --> 10:02.385
I never would have come here if...

10:02.420 --> 10:03.885
I know.

10:08.057 --> 10:10.559
He's lost, Savi.

10:10.593 --> 10:12.661
You're the only one that
can get through to him

10:12.696 --> 10:15.364
when he's like this.

10:15.398 --> 10:20.100
I can't be that person for him anymore.

10:20.135 --> 10:21.536
I'm sorry.

10:21.570 --> 10:24.238
But you're gonna have to
find the money someplace else.

10:27.409 --> 10:31.178
Or shut it down.

10:34.282 --> 10:37.083
- Mommy, mommy, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, sweetie.

10:37.117 --> 10:40.253
It's okay, sweetie. You're okay.

10:40.287 --> 10:41.788
Apparently, one of those Disney kids

10:41.823 --> 10:44.190
was giving a free concert
at the pier this afternoon.

10:44.225 --> 10:45.726
Your daughter got a little
lost trying to find it.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.893
A concert?

10:46.927 --> 10:49.195
Luckily, she located a
police officer right away.

10:49.230 --> 10:51.231
As you can see, she's pretty shaken up.

10:51.265 --> 10:54.199
Thank you so much, officer.
Thank you for bringing her home.

10:54.234 --> 10:55.368
Good night.

10:55.402 --> 10:57.202
Good night. Oh, it's okay.

10:57.237 --> 10:58.504
You're okay.

10:59.906 --> 11:02.441
Oh, God.

11:02.476 --> 11:04.042
Now that is something I could do

11:04.077 --> 11:05.644
at least another five to seven times.

11:07.446 --> 11:09.614
This office suits you.

11:09.648 --> 11:12.617
Mm. You should see what I
can do in a California king.

11:12.651 --> 11:14.185
I'm just sayin'.

11:14.219 --> 11:15.820
No, no, you misunderstand.

11:15.855 --> 11:17.622
I would like to put your name in

11:17.656 --> 11:19.891
for the management position, hmm?

11:19.925 --> 11:21.726
How do you feel about that?

11:21.761 --> 11:22.894
Aren't you the manager?

11:22.928 --> 11:25.362
No, no. I am a consultant.

11:25.397 --> 11:28.064
I was brought in to help put
the company back on track,

11:28.099 --> 11:29.400
which I did,

11:29.434 --> 11:31.402
with your assistance, of course.

11:31.436 --> 11:33.270
Oh. Well, you're welcome.

11:36.107 --> 11:37.841
Thank you.

11:37.876 --> 11:39.909
But now I have to go back
to Paris, so I have to...

11:39.943 --> 11:42.177
Wait, wait, whoa. What?

11:42.212 --> 11:45.347
I'm... I'm leaving tomorrow night.

11:45.382 --> 11:48.350
Wh... Olivier, you're going
back to Paris tomorrow evening?

11:48.385 --> 11:50.052
I thought I'd mentioned
this to you earlier.

11:50.086 --> 11:54.256
No. No, you... you never
mentioned it, Olivier, ever.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.758
Oh. You are upset?

11:56.793 --> 11:59.193
Yeah, I'm upset. What the
hell did we even do this for?

11:59.228 --> 12:01.496
Uh, forgive me. I don't follow.

12:01.531 --> 12:03.532
Olivier, if you had told me 48 hours ago

12:03.566 --> 12:04.733
that you were leaving,

12:04.767 --> 12:06.568
I wouldn't have let you
screw up my entire life.

12:06.602 --> 12:09.003
What kind of arrogant jerk
starts up a fling with someone

12:09.038 --> 12:11.139
two days before they leave the country?

12:11.173 --> 12:12.506
Hey.

12:12.541 --> 12:15.175
I didn't realize. I...

12:15.209 --> 12:17.878
Did you hope that this would
turn into something more?

12:17.913 --> 12:19.346
You and me? God, no.

12:19.380 --> 12:20.815
Then what is the problem?

12:20.849 --> 12:23.216
The problem is, Olivier,
it's obnoxious, okay?

12:23.251 --> 12:24.885
You knew that I was in a relationship!

12:24.920 --> 12:25.953
Yes.

12:25.987 --> 12:27.687
- And?
- And?

12:27.721 --> 12:29.589
Oh, my... and you didn't
even think twice about it,

12:29.623 --> 12:31.925
and now because of you,
Alex broke up with me, okay?

12:31.959 --> 12:33.359
Uh, no, no, no, no.

12:33.393 --> 12:35.428
Because of you she broke up with you.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.230
I don't have a girlfriend or wife.

12:38.265 --> 12:40.867
- I do have an ex-wife, so I...
- You know what? Never mind, okay?

12:40.901 --> 12:42.502
I was right about you. You're a douche.

12:42.536 --> 12:44.437
And you're still a child.

12:46.239 --> 12:48.240
Tant pis pour toi.

12:48.275 --> 12:50.476
Oh...  go back to Europe...

12:50.510 --> 12:51.777
Asshole.

13:19.942 --> 13:21.843
I dropped my phone in
the toilet this morning.

13:21.877 --> 13:23.878
Before you ask, I did try the rice thing,

13:23.912 --> 13:25.146
but it didn't help.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.581
So I ended up spending all day at the grove

13:26.615 --> 13:27.649
waiting for these geniuses.

13:27.683 --> 13:30.150
Which, are they geniuses? I think not.

13:30.184 --> 13:34.120
But I got my upgrade, so it was worth it.

13:34.155 --> 13:36.423
Um, so you haven't had your phone all day?

13:36.458 --> 13:38.659
No.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.694
I'm sorry.

13:40.729 --> 13:42.563
Um, did you try to call me?

13:42.597 --> 13:43.797
I... I should have checked in.

13:43.832 --> 13:44.965
I... I left a message for you.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.399
Um, Lucy went missing today.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.567
What?

13:47.601 --> 13:49.836
It's okay. We found her. She's fine.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.471
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

13:51.505 --> 13:53.473
God.

13:53.507 --> 13:55.808
Wait. "We" who?

13:57.110 --> 13:58.845
Paul was with me.

14:00.046 --> 14:01.180
Yeah, it... it's a long story,

14:01.214 --> 14:02.781
and I promise to tell you all about it,

14:02.815 --> 14:05.851
but right now, I really
just need to get some sleep.

14:05.885 --> 14:09.287
Of course. I'm really sorry
that I wasn't around today.

14:09.321 --> 14:11.990
Oh, no, it's okay. You... you didn't know.

14:12.024 --> 14:13.191
You okay?

14:13.225 --> 14:14.426
Can I call you tomorrow?

14:14.460 --> 14:16.828
Yeah, of course.

14:16.863 --> 14:18.796
I... I'll have my new phone.

14:18.830 --> 14:22.032
You can help me pick out a new wallpaper.

14:22.066 --> 14:23.401
- I can't wait.
- Yeah. Bye.

14:23.435 --> 14:25.202
Bye.

14:25.236 --> 14:26.871
Night.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.928
Walk with me.

14:51.962 --> 14:54.730
What's going on? Somebody die?

14:54.764 --> 14:56.899
They're not making the official
announcement until tomorrow,

14:56.934 --> 14:58.500
but I wanted to give you the heads-up

14:58.535 --> 15:00.436
- in case you're upset.
- Upset?

15:00.470 --> 15:02.071
Why would I be upset?

15:02.105 --> 15:03.806
Oh, my God. Somebody really did die?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.241
No. No, no. No... no one died.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.909
No, it's, um, they're making me...

15:07.944 --> 15:10.412
partner.

15:10.446 --> 15:12.480
Get outta here.

15:12.514 --> 15:14.449
Are you serious?

15:14.483 --> 15:16.251
Oh, Dom, that's amazing.

15:16.385 --> 15:18.920
Really? You're not secretly
hating me right now?

15:18.954 --> 15:21.689
No. No, of course not.
Why would I hate you?

15:21.723 --> 15:23.057
I just know how much you wanted this.

15:23.091 --> 15:25.792
I did want this.

15:25.826 --> 15:27.461
But I didn't earn it.

15:29.630 --> 15:32.099
I think we should celebrate.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.201
Fancy dinner?

15:34.235 --> 15:36.970
Bottle of wine that you
can drink all by yourself?

15:37.004 --> 15:40.739
Well, it's hard to say no to that.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.443
Tomorrow night?

15:43.477 --> 15:45.978
Tomorrow night sounds good.

15:46.012 --> 15:49.182
So it's a, um...

15:49.216 --> 15:50.883
it's a date?

15:50.917 --> 15:54.053
Yes.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.562
And while there are many
doctors in the association

16:03.597 --> 16:05.631
who are sympathetic
to end-of-life options

16:05.665 --> 16:08.400
for the terminally ill, the fact remains,

16:08.434 --> 16:11.669
assisted suicide is still illegal.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.170
But I didn't assist him.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.239
Did you prescribe the morphine?

16:15.273 --> 16:16.440
Yes, but...

16:16.475 --> 16:18.843
If you would like to deny
any of these allegations,

16:18.877 --> 16:21.946
including the affair with
your patient, Thomas Grey,

16:21.981 --> 16:25.683
I'd be happy to take it back to the board.

16:27.952 --> 16:30.087
Right.

16:30.121 --> 16:32.122
Then, unfortunately,

16:32.156 --> 16:34.791
you've crossed one too many ethical lines.

16:34.826 --> 16:36.059
Meaning what?

16:36.094 --> 16:39.262
There was talk of permanently
revoking your license.

16:39.296 --> 16:41.231
But because of the important work

16:41.265 --> 16:42.665
you've done in our community,

16:42.699 --> 16:44.399
the board felt that a 6-month suspension

16:44.434 --> 16:45.567
was more appropriate.

16:45.602 --> 16:47.069
Six months?

16:49.205 --> 16:51.573
Beginning immediately.

16:51.608 --> 16:52.842
Hold on.

16:52.876 --> 16:55.878
Do you realize what this
means to my practice?

16:55.912 --> 16:57.579
Forget my reputation, but my patients...

16:57.614 --> 16:58.747
Dr. Kim...

16:58.781 --> 17:00.849
I have several critical cases right now.

17:00.883 --> 17:02.450
I can't just abandon them.

17:02.484 --> 17:05.419
You should've thought of that before.

17:13.362 --> 17:15.494
You want another glass of milk?

17:15.530 --> 17:16.964
No, thank you.

17:21.036 --> 17:22.736
Do you want to talk about it?

17:22.771 --> 17:24.137
Do we have to?

17:25.540 --> 17:27.808
Eventually.

17:30.244 --> 17:32.444
But if you're not ready, we can wait.

17:32.479 --> 17:34.513
I'm not ready.

17:37.551 --> 17:39.018
Okay.

17:44.792 --> 17:48.827
But probably not gonna be
able to go tonight, right?

17:48.861 --> 17:50.428
Can't go where?

17:50.462 --> 17:51.797
To Audrey Rose's slumber party.

17:51.831 --> 17:52.964
It's her birthday.

17:52.999 --> 17:56.301
Oh, right, right. I forgot about that.

18:00.606 --> 18:01.740
You can go.

18:01.774 --> 18:03.373
Really?

18:03.408 --> 18:05.209
Promise is a promise.

18:05.243 --> 18:07.878
You're the best mom in the world.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.557
Hey, it's me.

18:21.592 --> 18:24.160
I need a girls' night.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.565
Ooh. Love the dress.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.167
Oh. Love yours more.

18:31.202 --> 18:32.168
Table, or...

18:32.203 --> 18:34.303
No, bar. I know my way.

18:34.338 --> 18:36.071
Hi. Can I get a shot of Tequila?

18:36.106 --> 18:37.139
Uh, top shelf?

18:37.173 --> 18:38.540
Thank you.

18:41.044 --> 18:42.510
Cheers.

18:44.814 --> 18:46.148
Cheers.

18:52.187 --> 18:53.320
Buy the next round,

18:53.355 --> 18:54.622
and maybe I'll let you sit closer to me.

18:54.656 --> 18:55.790
Two, please.

19:01.563 --> 19:02.864
I'm Morgan.

19:02.898 --> 19:06.200
Ouch. That's a terrible name.

19:07.401 --> 19:09.402
I'm gonna tell my mom you said that.

19:09.436 --> 19:11.704
- And I just brought up my mom, so...
- Yeah, you did.

19:11.739 --> 19:13.339
Can I start over?

19:13.374 --> 19:14.507
Please.

19:14.541 --> 19:16.276
Good. Thank you. Um...

19:16.310 --> 19:19.813
Hi. I'm Morgan. What's your name?

19:19.847 --> 19:23.249
Well, I haven't decided if
I'm gonna tell you that yet.

19:23.283 --> 19:25.450
It's a little early for Tequila, isn't it?

19:25.485 --> 19:27.552
It's happy hour, Harry. Get into it.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.054
You okay?

19:29.089 --> 19:31.456
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm great, in fact.

19:31.491 --> 19:32.892
I'm young, I'm single,

19:32.926 --> 19:34.426
the hostess girl loves my dress,

19:34.460 --> 19:36.495
so what more could a girl ask for?

19:37.964 --> 19:39.831
- Joss, you might wanna slow down a bit...
- Uh, hey, Harry,

19:39.865 --> 19:41.933
did... did you serve some
bad fish or something?

19:41.967 --> 19:45.003
Why is it so dead in here?

19:45.037 --> 19:46.504
Right-o. Have fun.

19:46.538 --> 19:47.571
What?

19:47.606 --> 19:49.440
Hey, can I get another round, please?

19:49.474 --> 19:50.842
Yes, coming right up.

19:57.581 --> 19:59.582
Hey.

19:59.617 --> 20:00.818
Hi.

20:05.423 --> 20:06.456
I wanna go first.

20:06.490 --> 20:08.192
Oh, I think we should wait for Joss.

20:08.226 --> 20:10.327
She didn't answer my text.
She might not be coming.

20:10.361 --> 20:12.728
Oh, then I think I
should go on Joss' behalf.

20:12.762 --> 20:14.430
You really think Joss
is gonna win this game?

20:14.464 --> 20:17.433
No, but I owe it to her to at least try.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.801
Hi. My name is Joss.

20:19.836 --> 20:25.974
And my life sucks the most because...

20:27.710 --> 20:29.644
You can't even think of one reason.

20:29.678 --> 20:33.981
No, wait. Because my
girlfriend broke up with me,

20:34.015 --> 20:35.816
and I am sad.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.322
To Joss.

20:41.356 --> 20:43.057
Okay. My turn.

20:43.091 --> 20:44.124
Hi. I'm Karen.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.126
My life sucks the most

20:46.161 --> 20:48.963
because my license got suspended.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.698
And my reputation as a
psychiatrist is officially mud.

20:52.733 --> 20:54.367
Do people still say "mud"?

20:54.401 --> 20:56.169
That sounds so old-fashioned.

20:56.203 --> 20:57.337
I think it's dated.

20:57.371 --> 21:00.473
Fine. My reputation is...

21:00.507 --> 21:02.141
destroyed.

21:02.176 --> 21:03.309
So dramatic.

21:03.344 --> 21:04.477
To me!

21:04.511 --> 21:05.678
- To Karen.
- To Karen.

21:08.348 --> 21:09.948
Okay. Whoo!

21:09.983 --> 21:12.084
- Okay.
- Here we go.

21:12.118 --> 21:14.086
Hi. I'm Savi.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.420
Hi, Savi.

21:15.454 --> 21:19.557
Uh, my life sucks the
most because I'm pregnant,

21:19.592 --> 21:21.159
and I don't know who the dad is...

21:21.194 --> 21:23.727
and I just found out
I'm not gonna be partner.

21:23.762 --> 21:24.896
Would you...

21:24.930 --> 21:27.564
And I'm going on the first date in 15 years

21:27.599 --> 21:30.868
because my marriage is dead.

21:30.903 --> 21:32.870
And, oh, yeah, I'm pregnant.

21:32.905 --> 21:35.506
I get to say that twice
because I feel really fat.

21:35.540 --> 21:36.507
You're not fat.

21:36.541 --> 21:39.209
I feel really fat.

21:39.243 --> 21:41.878
Fine. To Savi.

21:41.913 --> 21:43.046
To Savi.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.714
To me.

21:47.084 --> 21:48.618
Oh, my God, it's Paul.

21:48.652 --> 21:49.752
I thought he was leaving town.

21:49.787 --> 21:50.921
He was, but I needed his help

21:50.955 --> 21:52.389
when I couldn't find Lucy yesterday.

21:52.423 --> 21:54.023
You couldn't find Lucy yesterday?

21:54.057 --> 21:55.190
It's a long, horrible story

21:55.225 --> 21:56.458
which I will tell you about in a minute.

21:56.492 --> 21:57.626
Hey, Paul.

21:57.660 --> 21:58.727
Put him on speakerphone.

21:58.761 --> 22:00.595
- No. No.
- I just wanna hear his voice.

22:00.630 --> 22:02.364
Unlike you, I haven't seen him

22:02.399 --> 22:06.035
since he's... been alive.

22:06.069 --> 22:08.904
So who are you going on the date with?

22:08.939 --> 22:10.271
Why do you ask?

22:10.306 --> 22:12.540
I'm curious.

22:12.574 --> 22:14.042
Dom.

22:14.076 --> 22:15.209
Is that terrible?

22:15.244 --> 22:19.480
Not as terrible as me sleeping with Sam.

22:19.514 --> 22:21.249
What did he want?

22:21.283 --> 22:23.952
He wants to come by
tomorrow to talk about Lucy.

22:23.986 --> 22:25.853
What did you say?

22:25.887 --> 22:27.220
I said okay.

22:27.255 --> 22:28.855
He was so helpful yesterday,

22:28.889 --> 22:31.091
and I promised to call
him today and I didn't.

22:31.125 --> 22:32.592
Should I have said no?

22:32.626 --> 22:34.761
I think you have a runaway preteen daughter

22:34.795 --> 22:38.598
and a dead husband who isn't dead anymore.

22:38.632 --> 22:41.101
Which means you win the game, April.

22:41.135 --> 22:42.935
To April.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.903
To me.

22:47.607 --> 22:49.641
You slept with Sam?

22:54.614 --> 22:55.747
Oh, yeah.

22:56.950 --> 22:58.616
Slow down, baby.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.618
Slow down, baby.

23:02.488 --> 23:03.754
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, stop.

23:03.789 --> 23:04.922
No, don't fight it.

23:04.957 --> 23:06.091
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Stop.

23:06.125 --> 23:07.425
Shh. Shh. Just close your eyes. Stop.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.994
Shut up. Shut up.

23:09.028 --> 23:10.928
No, please don't do this.

23:17.635 --> 23:19.303
Let's go. Joss, let's go.

23:19.337 --> 23:20.770
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:20.805 --> 23:23.173
Harry...

23:41.229 --> 23:43.329
What a delicate flower you are.

23:45.699 --> 23:48.534
Did you put this bucket here?

23:48.568 --> 23:49.802
I did.

23:49.836 --> 23:51.304
Glad to see you're making the most of it.

23:51.338 --> 23:53.873
What happened last night?

23:53.908 --> 23:55.875
Seriously. I don't remember anything.

23:55.910 --> 23:57.377
Probably for the best.

23:57.411 --> 23:59.177
Although, maybe not.

23:59.212 --> 24:01.880
Lessons must be learned and whatnot.

24:01.915 --> 24:03.615
Must they?

24:03.649 --> 24:05.450
So what's going on with you?

24:05.484 --> 24:07.185
You were in a bit of a state last night

24:07.220 --> 24:10.822
even before the Tequila took over.

24:13.159 --> 24:15.326
Alex broke up with me.

24:16.728 --> 24:18.262
Sorry to hear that.

24:18.297 --> 24:20.331
Sorry but not surprised, right?

24:20.365 --> 24:22.333
It's not like anyone ever expected me

24:22.367 --> 24:24.435
to be relationship material.

24:24.469 --> 24:26.437
Well, not with a woman, because...

24:26.471 --> 24:27.771
you're not a lesbian.

24:27.806 --> 24:28.940
It shouldn't matter, Harry.

24:28.974 --> 24:30.174
Uh, yeah.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.674
It does.

24:31.708 --> 24:33.043
No, but it shouldn't.

24:33.077 --> 24:35.878
I'm supposed to be this
sexually liberated free spirit,

24:35.913 --> 24:37.380
and...

24:37.415 --> 24:38.881
maybe it's all just a load of crap.

24:38.916 --> 24:41.184
Maybe I'm actually a self-destructive,

24:41.218 --> 24:43.186
emotionally stunted idiot.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.354
Maybe you're both.

24:44.388 --> 24:46.722
Seriously, I will puke on your face.

24:46.757 --> 24:48.390
Uh, you do have a tendency

24:48.425 --> 24:51.260
to make things harder
than they need to be, Joss,

24:51.294 --> 24:54.363
but that's what your
20s are about, I suppose.

24:54.397 --> 24:56.865
What, being stupid?

24:56.899 --> 24:58.567
Screwing up enough

24:58.601 --> 25:00.235
until you figure out who you are...

25:00.270 --> 25:02.271
and what you want.

25:02.305 --> 25:04.105
You know what's great about you, Joss,

25:04.139 --> 25:05.840
is that...

25:05.874 --> 25:07.541
you'll try anything.

25:09.578 --> 25:10.878
What's not so great

25:10.912 --> 25:13.414
is that you don't know when to stop.

25:15.417 --> 25:18.086
But you'll figure it out.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.786
Hey.

25:19.820 --> 25:21.521
You're not broken.

25:27.428 --> 25:28.728
Yep.

25:28.762 --> 25:30.230
Gonna sharf.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.614
Thanks for sitting down with me.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.249
Um, I've just been
thinking about Lucy nonstop

25:51.283 --> 25:54.652
and... wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.321
I don't know how okay it is.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.189
We haven't talked about anything.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.657
Did you at least ground her?

25:59.691 --> 26:00.992
It didn't seem like the right thing to do.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.861
She was... so scared, and...

26:03.896 --> 26:07.297
I don't know. It's not
like when she was a baby.

26:07.332 --> 26:10.300
Do you remember that
9-1-1 book we used to have?

26:11.503 --> 26:12.636
The green one?

26:12.670 --> 26:13.803
Yeah.

26:13.838 --> 26:16.540
I think we dog-eared every page.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.013
I don't know what I'm doing.

26:24.048 --> 26:26.849
You're doing everything you can.

26:26.883 --> 26:28.851
You said it. I mean,
she's not a baby anymore.

26:28.885 --> 26:31.521
She probably senses something's off.

26:31.555 --> 26:33.523
Yeah, and when I try
and talk to her about it,

26:33.557 --> 26:34.957
she refuses.

26:34.991 --> 26:37.026
Maybe she needs to talk to someone else.

26:37.061 --> 26:39.694
You mean like a therapist?

26:39.728 --> 26:41.930
Sorry. That's probably stupid.

26:41.964 --> 26:44.732
No, no, it's... it's not stupid.

26:44.767 --> 26:46.734
It's not stupid at all.

26:58.914 --> 27:00.748
Good morning, Joss.

27:00.783 --> 27:03.149
I hear congratulations are in order.

27:03.184 --> 27:04.317
Why are you smiling at me like that?

27:04.351 --> 27:05.485
You're freaking me out.

27:05.519 --> 27:06.653
I'm just sucking up to the new boss,

27:06.688 --> 27:08.354
who I hear

27:08.389 --> 27:10.824
has a thing for the ladies.

27:10.858 --> 27:14.061
Truth be told... I swing.

27:14.095 --> 27:16.396
Oh, my God. You're kidding
me. I'm the new manager?

27:16.430 --> 27:18.430
Well, yeah, Olivier announced it yesterday.

27:18.465 --> 27:20.499
I guess you were out celebrating.

27:23.604 --> 27:24.904
No.

27:26.873 --> 27:29.575
What... what are you doing?

27:29.610 --> 27:31.677
I'm quitting, Mona.

27:31.712 --> 27:32.945
Do you want my frog?

27:32.980 --> 27:34.112
Oh, yes.

27:34.146 --> 27:35.680
Wait. But you just got promoted.

27:35.715 --> 27:37.348
Exactly.

27:37.382 --> 27:40.351
I'm getting better and
better at a job that I hate.

27:40.385 --> 27:42.353
This is not what I want to
do for the rest of my life.

27:42.387 --> 27:44.122
Well, what do you want
to do with your life?

27:44.156 --> 27:45.289
I don't know,

27:45.324 --> 27:46.958
but I'm not gonna figure it out

27:46.993 --> 27:48.960
selling crappy houses to crappy people.

27:48.995 --> 27:50.861
Hey, can I have your desk?

27:50.895 --> 27:52.395
Sure.

27:52.430 --> 27:54.832
Oh, sweetie, you missed one.

27:57.335 --> 27:58.535
Thanks, I...

27:58.569 --> 27:59.703
Oh, wait.

27:59.738 --> 28:01.471
Um, that's... that's my property.

28:02.674 --> 28:05.142
Yeah, I just gave you a frog, Mona.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.745
Call it a parting gift.

28:36.438 --> 28:39.406
You know, I'm really sick of
seeing your name on my phone.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.741
Then stop coming after me.

28:40.776 --> 28:42.242
It's over, Elizabeth.

28:42.277 --> 28:43.577
What are you babbling on about now?

28:43.611 --> 28:45.245
I know you contacted the state board

28:45.280 --> 28:47.447
to have my license suspended.

28:47.482 --> 28:49.984
And they have. So you won, okay?

28:50.018 --> 28:51.819
You won.

28:51.853 --> 28:53.320
I have no idea what you're saying to me.

28:53.354 --> 28:55.354
My license is suspended.

28:55.389 --> 28:57.323
You're saying you had no part in that?

28:57.357 --> 28:58.658
No, actually, I didn't.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.493
So I guess I'm not the only person

29:00.527 --> 29:02.295
who finds you a giant bitch.

29:03.630 --> 29:04.764
Good-bye, Elizabeth.

29:04.799 --> 29:05.932
Wait, wait, wait.

29:05.966 --> 29:07.801
Let me get this straight.

29:07.835 --> 29:09.702
So you ruin my life,

29:09.736 --> 29:11.369
and all that happens to you is,

29:11.404 --> 29:13.538
you get your license suspended?

29:13.573 --> 29:15.140
What a joke.

29:16.843 --> 29:18.310
Did she just hang up on me?

29:18.344 --> 29:19.812
Unbelievable.

29:21.014 --> 29:23.348
Was that Karen?

29:24.617 --> 29:27.185
Excuse me?

29:27.219 --> 29:28.953
Don't you mean Dr. Kim?

29:28.987 --> 29:31.022
Or are you two that close now?

29:31.056 --> 29:32.690
You're wasted.

29:32.725 --> 29:34.826
Hey, don't you walk away from me!

29:34.860 --> 29:36.961
I'm not talking to you
when you're like this, mom.

29:58.137 --> 30:00.137
So I thought we could go back to that,

30:00.172 --> 30:02.173
uh, therapist... Dr. Foley.

30:02.207 --> 30:03.508
You remember her?

30:03.542 --> 30:05.008
She was the therapist you saw af...

30:05.042 --> 30:07.377
After dad died. Yeah.

30:09.647 --> 30:11.448
If you want to see someone else, we...

30:11.482 --> 30:13.417
Why can't you just ground
me like a normal person?

30:13.451 --> 30:15.419
It's not supposed to
be a punishment, honey.

30:15.453 --> 30:16.920
I'm just worried about you.

30:16.954 --> 30:18.755
And since you don't seem
to want to talk to me...

30:18.790 --> 30:20.256
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

30:20.291 --> 30:23.158
No, I'm not kidding.

30:23.193 --> 30:24.960
I'm trying to figure out a way

30:24.994 --> 30:26.629
to get us back to the way we used to be.

30:26.663 --> 30:28.631
You and me... we were the dynamic duo,

30:28.665 --> 30:29.898
remember?

30:34.371 --> 30:37.038
What?

30:37.072 --> 30:39.870
Tell me what you're
thinking. I can't fix it...

30:39.875 --> 30:42.644
It's not my fault we're
not the dynamic duo anymore.

30:42.678 --> 30:45.046
You're never here.

30:48.986 --> 30:51.755
You're right.

30:51.789 --> 30:54.356
It's my fault, and I'm sorry, Lucy.

30:54.391 --> 30:56.358
I'm truly sorry.

30:57.894 --> 30:59.361
It's not your fault.

30:59.396 --> 31:02.631
It's just what happens. I get it.

31:02.666 --> 31:03.965
You get what?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.267
You're with Richard now.

31:05.302 --> 31:07.436
It makes sense, you don't
have time for me anymore.

31:07.470 --> 31:10.070
Oh, honey. Is that what you think?

31:10.105 --> 31:11.406
It's obvious you like him a lot,

31:11.440 --> 31:12.740
which means you're gonna get married and...

31:12.775 --> 31:14.241
Whoa. Whoa. Slow down.

31:14.276 --> 31:16.678
Nobody is getting married.

31:16.712 --> 31:19.280
Maybe not now, but someday.

31:22.250 --> 31:24.751
Is... is that what's been worrying you?

31:24.786 --> 31:27.120
Do you not like Richard?

31:27.154 --> 31:28.622
I like him okay.

31:28.656 --> 31:31.090
And Madi's nice.

31:31.125 --> 31:33.860
I'm just not ready for a new family.

31:36.297 --> 31:38.799
I kinda still miss our old one.

31:47.641 --> 31:49.308
Ooh, okay.

31:49.343 --> 31:50.476
Okay, blow it out.

31:50.510 --> 31:51.644
No, you blow it out.

31:51.678 --> 31:52.812
No, I'm scared.

31:52.846 --> 31:53.979
Okay, why did you order this?

31:54.013 --> 31:56.781
Because I know how much you like chocolate.

31:56.816 --> 31:58.616
All right, all right.
I'm gonna blow it out.

31:58.651 --> 32:00.284
But if I gets all over your dress,

32:00.319 --> 32:01.653
you can't get mad.

32:01.687 --> 32:02.987
Oh, I'll be mad.

32:03.021 --> 32:04.489
- Okay, so put... all right, shield up.
- Okay.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.257
- Shield up. Ready?
- Yeah.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.826
All right.

32:09.438 --> 32:10.738
Oh, come on.

32:10.773 --> 32:12.073
Come on! Okay, that's it. That's it.

32:13.275 --> 32:14.441
Next time I'm picking the restaurant

32:14.476 --> 32:15.776
and I'm picking the dessert.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.844
I mean, assuming there is a next time.

32:17.879 --> 32:19.713
Yep.

32:19.747 --> 32:22.483
It feels like there could be.

32:22.517 --> 32:24.585
Doesn't it?

32:27.522 --> 32:29.656
It does to me.

32:41.968 --> 32:44.536
Remember when we wanted this

32:44.571 --> 32:46.771
to go outside our offices?

32:46.806 --> 32:49.608
Our failed logo.

32:49.642 --> 32:52.177
I was so obsessed with
seeing my name on the door,

32:52.212 --> 32:54.045
we hired three different companies

32:54.080 --> 32:56.047
to come up with this design.

32:56.082 --> 32:59.150
Spent a fortune.

32:59.185 --> 33:02.820
Couple a hundred bucks, I think.

33:04.423 --> 33:07.024
It felt like a lot at the time.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.035
I'm so sorry, Jacob.

33:19.871 --> 33:22.072
About what?

33:22.107 --> 33:23.840
Which part?

33:25.475 --> 33:27.443
All of it.

33:29.279 --> 33:32.281
About keeping things from you,

33:32.315 --> 33:33.983
putting you in this position.

33:34.017 --> 33:36.853
I'm the one who turned you in, Karen.

33:39.223 --> 33:41.522
I thought you should know.

33:43.259 --> 33:46.427
But... why?

33:46.462 --> 33:47.763
You said you understood.

33:47.797 --> 33:51.099
I understood helping a sick patient.

33:54.070 --> 33:55.836
Don't understand sleeping with him.

33:55.871 --> 33:57.337
That's fine.

33:57.372 --> 34:00.340
But to go behind my back? Why would you...

34:00.375 --> 34:01.876
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

34:01.910 --> 34:03.710
Are you seriously gonna
talk to me right now

34:03.745 --> 34:06.580
about going behind your back?

34:06.614 --> 34:08.514
For months, Karen,

34:08.549 --> 34:10.449
for months, I have been sitting here

34:10.485 --> 34:13.452
like a... like a jackass...

34:13.487 --> 34:15.621
supporting you, trusting you.

34:15.656 --> 34:17.523
And this whole time,

34:17.556 --> 34:19.292
you... you've been lying to my face?

34:19.326 --> 34:21.360
Jacob, I'm so sorry.

34:21.395 --> 34:23.562
I don't believe you.

34:23.597 --> 34:25.899
And that's the problem. I...

34:25.933 --> 34:28.801
I don't think I can believe a word you say,

34:28.835 --> 34:31.402
ever again.

34:31.437 --> 34:34.106
Which means...

34:34.139 --> 34:37.309
there's really no way to continue this.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.577
Continue what?

34:39.612 --> 34:41.579
What are you saying?

34:41.614 --> 34:43.648
I'm... I'm saying...

34:45.117 --> 34:47.217
I'm saying, we're done.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.554
When your suspension is up,

34:51.589 --> 34:53.389
don't bother coming back.

35:26.389 --> 35:27.522
Hey.

35:27.557 --> 35:28.690
You can't keep doing this.

35:28.725 --> 35:30.559
No, no, I'm not. I swear.

35:30.593 --> 35:32.760
I'm not gonna be that person.

35:32.794 --> 35:35.429
I know we... we can't get back together

35:35.464 --> 35:37.565
and I know we can't be friends anymore.

35:37.599 --> 35:38.900
I get it.

35:38.934 --> 35:40.201
Okay.

35:44.006 --> 35:45.139
What's this?

35:45.174 --> 35:46.507
It's not a huge space,

35:46.541 --> 35:48.008
but it's got great light, big windows.

35:48.042 --> 35:52.579
It's in a cool up-and-coming
area near Echo Park.

35:52.613 --> 35:55.448
I think it'd make a perfect yoga studio.

35:55.483 --> 35:58.518
I already negotiated the
price down to nothing,

35:58.552 --> 36:00.787
so just give Quinn a call

36:00.821 --> 36:03.890
and tell him I sent you, okay?

36:10.297 --> 36:11.830
I have a question.

36:14.234 --> 36:16.702
Anything.

36:16.736 --> 36:18.704
Why did you do this?

36:18.738 --> 36:21.139
I mean, I know why I did it.

36:21.173 --> 36:23.641
I... I was hoping so badly
that it would work out,

36:23.675 --> 36:24.976
even though, deep down,

36:25.011 --> 36:26.544
I knew that I couldn't change you, and...

36:26.578 --> 36:28.546
No, no, no.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.782
But you did change me.

36:30.816 --> 36:32.784
Joss...

36:32.818 --> 36:35.720
You were never gonna become a lesbian.

36:35.754 --> 36:37.254
No.

36:37.289 --> 36:39.890
Probably not. 

36:41.192 --> 36:43.660
Why did you try to be?

36:43.694 --> 36:46.163
For you.

36:47.865 --> 36:49.699
If being in a relationship was

36:49.734 --> 36:51.701
the only way that we could
keep hanging out together,

36:51.736 --> 36:55.071
then... I thought I'd go for it.

36:58.242 --> 37:02.078
I just wanted to be with you.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.014
This was free.

37:09.118 --> 37:10.585
It shouldn't be.

38:01.364 --> 38:02.531
Oh, thank you.

38:02.565 --> 38:05.600
Thank you. This was
supposed to be my treat.

38:05.635 --> 38:07.837
Next time.

38:10.473 --> 38:12.107
It's cold.

38:12.142 --> 38:14.209
You know what? Come here. Come here.

38:18.914 --> 38:22.317
I never knew you were such a gentleman.

38:22.351 --> 38:25.686
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

38:38.299 --> 38:40.601
Was that not okay? I thought that, um...

38:40.635 --> 38:42.837
Yeah, I know.

38:42.871 --> 38:45.339
I thought so, too.

38:45.373 --> 38:47.640
It's, uh, it's okay.

38:47.675 --> 38:49.342
I... I understand.

38:49.377 --> 38:52.579
You're not... you're not ready.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.216
Maybe it's just too soon?

39:06.526 --> 39:09.094
So she'll start seeing Dr. Foley this week.

39:09.128 --> 39:10.429
Once a week for now,

39:10.463 --> 39:12.264
and then we'll see how it goes.

39:12.298 --> 39:13.632
That sounds great.

39:13.666 --> 39:16.602
I'm glad Lucy was open to it.

39:16.636 --> 39:18.202
Well, she's not thrilled
about it, but it's...

39:18.236 --> 39:19.704
it's the right thing to do.

39:21.907 --> 39:24.975
I also wanted to say, thank
you for your suggestion.

39:25.010 --> 39:28.078
I'm glad I was here.

39:30.749 --> 39:32.850
Uh, so what time is your flight?

39:32.885 --> 39:38.354
Actually, it was a few hours ago.

39:38.389 --> 39:39.689
I want to stay, April.

39:39.724 --> 39:41.658
That's not...

39:41.692 --> 39:43.794
What does that even mean?

39:43.828 --> 39:45.128
How can you think to...

39:45.162 --> 39:46.663
I want a second chance.

39:46.697 --> 39:48.398
I'll do whatever it takes.

39:48.433 --> 39:50.379
That's impossible. You
can't just start over.

39:50.380 --> 39:51.380
Why not?

39:51.668 --> 39:52.968
You committed fraud, for one thing.

39:53.002 --> 39:54.870
So I'll turn myself in.

39:54.905 --> 39:57.539
If I have to go to jail, then so be it.

39:57.573 --> 39:59.874
Look, I made the biggest
mistake of my life.

39:59.909 --> 40:03.177
All I want to do now is make it right.

40:03.211 --> 40:06.414
I want to be with my wife

40:06.449 --> 40:09.250
and my little girl, who I love.

40:11.921 --> 40:15.188
I miss my family, April.

40:48.387 --> 40:50.489
Uh, hey, Jeff, it's Savi.

40:50.523 --> 40:52.958
Don't pull the plug.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.426
I can't let Harry lose his
restaurant because of me.

40:55.461 --> 40:59.764
And since I can't seem
to move on with my life,

40:59.799 --> 41:04.034
maybe this will be good for both of us.

41:04.068 --> 41:06.036
I'll, uh, send you a check tomorrow.

41:06.070 --> 41:07.538
Uh, but... but please,

41:07.572 --> 41:10.708
don't let Harry know that
the money came from me.

41:12.811 --> 41:14.444
Okay, bye.
