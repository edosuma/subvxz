Mel b.: Well, I think we're

29:07.639 --> 29:12.178
no longer a family show today.
I can't believe how you got away

29:12.179 --> 29:15.038
with it and made it funny and
still edgy and still acceptable

29:15.039 --> 29:18.508
and still a family show.
But I get your sense of humor,

29:18.509 --> 29:21.338
you naughty girl.
I want to come to the

There are two sides to me.

30:43.679 --> 30:47.878
On stage, I'm a singer.
And when I'm off stage, I do

30:47.879 --> 30:52.278
have the biggest responsibility,
and that is being a mom, you

He is really proud.

I know this is my moment.
Knowing that Tony is there, that

the one that was always there

44:33.679 --> 44:38.038

me to follow my dreams and not

44:38.039 --> 44:42.708
let anybody or anything hold me
back.

50% chance that my daughter

44:45.809 --> 44:49.208
could have it, and I want to
make sure my daughter knows that

44:49.209 --> 44:51.378
she's strong and she's beautiful
and she can do whatever she

44:51.379 --> 44:54.078
wants to in life, and that's
because of all of the values my

I want to raise my daughter to

44:58.879 --> 45:02.038

46:04.979 --> 46:07.708
Yeah.
What up?

46:07.709 --> 46:10.708
What up, people?
Yeah.

46:10.709 --> 46:13.708
Yo, I met my wife.
I met my wife in high school

46:13.709 --> 46:15.308
theater class.
We hate each other.

46:15.309 --> 46:18.878
So the teacher put us in a group
because that's what teachers do.

46:18.879 --> 46:24.308
And we had to do a skit where
she played a cop and I played a

46:24.309 --> 46:25.408
robber.
Real quick, she was supposed to

46:25.409 --> 46:28.778
say put your hands up and I put
my hands up and she said

46:28.779 --> 46:31.538
"freeze!"
and I did my best to freeze and

46:31.539 --> 46:35.038
she didn't know I had tourette's
and she got pissed off.

46:35.039 --> 46:38.978
I never seen her so mad.
She put me against the wall and

46:38.979 --> 46:43.238
said "freeze, fool!"
I was like, damn, I'm going to

46:43.239 --> 46:44.908
marry this woman.
I like her passion.

46:44.909 --> 46:48.078
We're a silly couple.
That's what makes us work.

46:48.079 --> 46:49.508
I don't like couples that take
themselves too seriously.

46:49.509 --> 46:53.278
I was walking and there was this
dude with his arm around this

46:53.279 --> 46:56.938
girl and he was squeezing her
butt and he made eye contact

46:56.939 --> 47:00.008
with me and decided in that
moment to squeeze harder.

47:00.009 --> 47:04.808
Then he went like this to me, as
if to let me know, hey, man, I

47:04.809 --> 47:08.338
squeeze butts.
And I didn't like that, because

47:08.339 --> 47:11.078
it was like he was telling me
that I don't squeeze butts, and

47:11.079 --> 47:14.108
I wanted to embarrass him and
make him feel uncool in the

47:14.109 --> 47:18.608
moment, so when he went, I just
pretended to get shot.

47:18.609 --> 47:22.708
He was like -- I said, no!
Damn it!

47:22.709 --> 47:27.108
And then this dumb ass checked
his hand, like he forgot he

47:27.109 --> 47:31.238
loaded it.
He came up to me afterwards, he

47:31.239 --> 47:34.238
was like, oh, you're that funny
guy, you're that comedian with

47:34.239 --> 47:37.338
tourette's, huh?
I don't even believe you have

47:37.339 --> 47:39.538
tourette's.
I haven't heard you cuss once.

47:39.539 --> 47:42.308
I was like, only 10% have that
kind.

47:42.309 --> 47:44.438
Most people have what I have,
two different extremes, so when

47:44.439 --> 47:52.838
I cuss you out, it's from the
heart.

47:52.839 --> 47:59.238
[ Cheers and applause ]
It's because I hate you.

47:59.239 --> 48:00.908
And I don't like rude people,
man.

48:00.909 --> 48:02.978
I really don't.
Like, if you honk at me on the

48:02.979 --> 48:05.278
street from now on, I'm going to
follow you home.

48:05.279 --> 48:06.938
People don't believe me.
This is my job.

48:06.939 --> 48:09.208
I don't do anything from 6:00
A.M. until 8:00 P.M.

48:09.209 --> 48:12.878
I have a lot of time to follow
you home.

48:12.879 --> 48:15.878
I don't like rude people.
I get offended in public when

48:15.879 --> 48:17.678
someone's being rude.
I get offended for everybody,

48:17.679 --> 48:20.678
even if I don't know you.
So from now on, from this day

48:20.679 --> 48:23.478
forward, and I mean this from
the bottom of my heart, if I

48:23.479 --> 48:30.808
open a door for you and you
don't say thank you, I'm pulling

48:30.809 --> 48:40.138
you the hell back in.
[ Cheers and applause ]

48:40.139 --> 48:42.878
You can stay inside until you
get some manners.

48:42.879 --> 48:46.108
I don't like rude people, man.
A lady came up to me recently,

48:46.109 --> 48:48.178
was like, how do you go to the
bathroom with tourette's?

48:48.179 --> 48:51.178
I was like, what the heck?
That's a rude question, first of

48:51.179 --> 48:52.978
all.
You don't have to add "with

48:52.979 --> 48:54.508
tourette's" at the end of a
question.

48:54.509 --> 48:57.438
He's always there, all right?
I haven't been like going to the

48:57.439 --> 48:59.508
bathroom, tourette's, you stay
outside, I'm going to do this

48:59.509 --> 49:03.078
and pick you up after.
Second it's crazy because you've

49:03.079 --> 49:07.938
seen my twitch.
It's noticeable, but it's not

49:07.939 --> 49:08.939
insane.
My body's not here and I'm

49:08.940 --> 49:10.208
headbutting the judges.
It's not crazy.

49:10.209 --> 49:14.438
I never once in my 30 years of
living walked into a public

49:14.439 --> 49:17.638
restroom and just been like,
everybody move!

49:17.639 --> 49:20.108
I have tourette's!
It's about to get messy.

49:20.109 --> 49:26.478
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

49:26.479 --> 49:29.938
Tyra: Well, everybody is
moving because everybody left

49:29.939 --> 49:31.678
their seat for you.
Wow!

49:31.679 --> 49:38.408
Mel b., let's start with you.
Mel b.: I am smiling from ear

49:38.409 --> 49:41.978
to ear.
My cheeks are hurting because I

49:41.979 --> 49:44.038
was laughing so much.
You know what it is?

49:44.039 --> 49:47.308
It's just the way that you style
out these jokes and you're

49:47.309 --> 49:50.108
deliberate, and I can't believe
you can actually talk that long

49:50.109 --> 49:55.208
without taking a breath.
You really honed in your work,

49:55.209 --> 49:57.838
and you would pull that punch
line after punch line after

49:57.839 --> 49:59.278
punch line.
You're amazing.

49:59.279 --> 50:01.138
I think you're brilliant.
I love your swagger.

50:01.139 --> 50:06.378
I love everything about you.
Tyra: Heidi Klum.

50:06.379 --> 50:10.908
Heidi: Samuel, Samuel.
You won me over tonight.

50:10.909 --> 50:15.878
You really have.
I think this was your best

50:15.879 --> 50:19.078
performance this far, and I wish
you good luck for tomorrow.

50:19.079 --> 50:20.838
Thank you so much.
Tyra: Simon?

50:20.839 --> 50:23.038
Simon: I was just thinking,
because I'm not an expert on

50:23.039 --> 50:26.608
this, but the great thing about
watching a comedian is you know

50:26.609 --> 50:29.178
when they're good by the
audience reaction, and the

50:29.179 --> 50:34.638
audience loved you tonight.
I could tell that.

50:34.639 --> 50:37.138
And in addition, it's not just
you, Samuel.

50:37.139 --> 50:41.208
Whereas a week ago, everyone was
literally dying because of their

50:41.209 --> 50:43.508
nerves, you had a sharpness to
you tonight, along with

50:43.509 --> 50:46.308
everybody else, which is a --
you want to win this, and I

50:46.309 --> 50:48.838
respect you for that.
You've given yourself a shot

50:48.839 --> 50:51.178
after that, I've got to tell
you.

50:51.179 --> 50:53.778
Thank you so much.
Tyra: Howie, you are the

50:53.779 --> 50:55.638
comedian expert, so what do you
have to say?

50:55.639 --> 50:57.578
Howie: Well, I think it's all
subjective.

50:57.579 --> 51:00.338
But I've got to tell you,
personally, I love you.

51:00.339 --> 51:02.078
I thought you brought your "a"
game.

51:02.079 --> 51:04.008
I thought America loves you,
this audience loves you.

51:04.009 --> 51:07.938
That was your best act yet.
I think your mother is looking

51:07.939 --> 51:09.708
down at you --
Tyra: Yes.

51:09.709 --> 51:11.978
Howie: You're a great man, a
great comedian and deserving to

51:11.979 --> 51:13.638

I wish you the best of luck.

51:13.639 --> 51:19.278
I love you and your career just
took off tonight.

51:19.279 --> 51:21.778
Tyra: All right, so, what is
going through this, your funny

51:21.779 --> 51:25.978
bone right now?
Just this journey's been

51:25.979 --> 51:28.078
amazing, and I said since the
beginning, I want to be the

51:28.079 --> 51:31.908
first comedian to win this show,
and I think I just gave myself a

51:31.909 --> 51:32.779

Tyra: I love it.

51:32.780 --> 51:35.808

only I could right now.

When I perform, I try to
bring music to magic.

With the movements and with my
hands and the cards.

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:13.738
When I was in college, I was
studying to become a concert

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:16.138
pianist.
Even though my main focus was

01:00:16.139 --> 01:00:19.438
music, I always found myself
coming back to magic.

01:00:19.439 --> 01:00:22.938
Two years into my music
education, I started to feel

01:00:22.939 --> 01:00:30.578
pain in both of my wrists.
I found out that I had carpal

01:00:30.579 --> 01:00:32.438
tunnel.
The doctor told me that I

01:00:32.439 --> 01:00:35.708
couldn't do both piano and
magic.

01:00:35.709 --> 01:00:40.178
I had to choose one.
Probably the toughest decision

01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:43.578
of my life, but I had to choose
magic.

01:00:43.579 --> 01:00:47.478
Looking back, that decision has
completely changed the direction

01:00:47.479 --> 01:00:50.408
of my life.
In a really good way, yeah, the

01:00:50.409 --> 01:01:00.608
best way.
It's taken me here.

America that I have what it

01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:15.378

throughout the competition,
which was your lack of

Our relationship grew so strong
because she had to put so much

we put everything we had into
putting this act together.

Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:15:34.639 --> 01:15:36.778
Simon: I have so much respect
for what you do.

01:15:36.779 --> 01:15:40.978
This is live TV.
This could have been a

01:15:40.979 --> 01:15:43.178
prerecording, because these
things can go horribly wrong,

01:15:43.179 --> 01:15:46.608
and it did once, but you are
absolutely sensational at what

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:48.238
you do.
You've made the show special.

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:50.078
Thank you very much.
Simon: Best performance

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:51.878
you've done so far.
Amazing.

01:15:51.879 --> 01:15:53.238
Amazing.
Tyra: Howie?

01:15:53.239 --> 01:15:56.808
Howie: It is amazing and you
figure, how are they going to

01:15:56.809 --> 01:16:00.108
step it up?
If I'm correct, you were

01:16:00.109 --> 01:16:03.778
blindfolded the entire act, not
just one trick, the entire act.

01:16:03.779 --> 01:16:05.178
Also the production and
everything around it.

01:16:05.179 --> 01:16:08.608
This is the best show I've ever
seen, never mind been on.

01:16:08.609 --> 01:16:10.778
I've never been on a show like
this.

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:12.808
This is amazing.
Every act seems like a winning

01:16:12.809 --> 01:16:14.638

I am so confused.

01:16:14.639 --> 01:16:16.708
Good luck, America.
Thank you.

Tyra: Mel b.
Mel b.: Well, first off, I

01:16:19.639 --> 01:16:22.408
think my favorite part was when
you dropped him at the end.

01:16:22.409 --> 01:16:25.178
But having said that.
You know, I think we just

01:16:25.179 --> 01:16:27.938
actually realized how strong you
have to be to do what you do and

01:16:27.939 --> 01:16:30.238
you make it look easy and
seamless and flawless.

01:16:30.239 --> 01:16:33.078
That again, you've stepped it up
another level.

01:16:33.079 --> 01:16:37.308
By far your best performance.
Simon: Mel, can I say

01:16:37.309 --> 01:16:38.838
something?
Do not try this at home.

01:16:38.839 --> 01:16:41.538
Tyra: You're right, do not
try this at home, no matter how

01:16:41.539 --> 01:16:46.108
much you love each other.
So, you held him this time.

01:16:46.109 --> 01:16:49.978
That shocked all of us.
Where does that emotional and

01:16:49.979 --> 01:16:53.078
physical strength from km from?
Well, I trust him and he

01:16:53.079 --> 01:16:54.908
trusts me and we both have to be
strong for each other.

01:16:54.909 --> 01:16:58.178
And I just want to say, we are
so honored to be here with all

Michael, I just want to thank

01:18:02.809 --> 01:18:07.238
you from the bottom of my heart.
The care that you gave my son in

01:18:07.239 --> 01:18:08.778
the hospital.
You gave me hope.

01:18:08.779 --> 01:18:11.378
There were many days and
nights that I didn't think I

01:18:11.379 --> 01:18:14.438
could make it through, and you
gave me strength.

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:19.808
I think what really bonded
our hearts to you forever was

01:18:19.809 --> 01:18:22.108
when you walked with us through
the loss of our little girl.

01:18:22.109 --> 01:18:24.938
Ten years ago, you wrote me a
letter encouraging me about

01:18:24.939 --> 01:18:29.108
being a father.
We first met you in iv in

01:18:29.109 --> 01:18:32.308
2011, I think it was?
We have two siblings we're

01:18:32.309 --> 01:18:34.538
