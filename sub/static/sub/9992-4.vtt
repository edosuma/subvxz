00:00.162 --> 00:02.623
A tisket, a tasket

00:02.694 --> 00:05.485
A green and yellow basket

00:05.593 --> 00:08.621
I wrote a letter to my love

00:08.679 --> 00:11.133
And on the way I dropped it

00:11.239 --> 00:13.908
I dropped it, I dropped it

00:13.995 --> 00:16.831
And on the way I dropped it

00:16.954 --> 00:19.662
A little boy picked it up

00:19.718 --> 00:22.571
and put it in his pocket

00:22.687 --> 00:25.360
A tisket, a tasket

00:25.473 --> 00:28.145
A green and yellow basket

00:28.262 --> 00:30.701
I wrote a letter to...

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

02:56.180 --> 02:59.234
Bridge? Come on, I'm begging you. Open the door.

02:59.293 --> 03:02.229
- You have school.
- No! I hate school.

03:02.484 --> 03:07.790
Yeah, well, I like school and I still have to get dressed! Unlock the door, you little freak!

03:07.867 --> 03:09.063
- Ariel!
- Hey, what's all the racket?

03:09.115 --> 03:10.539
Mom, I want my own room!

03:10.626 --> 03:12.448
Bridgette, you know you're not supposed to lock the door.

03:12.535 --> 03:14.875
And I want my own private island and a private jet to take me there...

03:14.969 --> 03:17.952
- Bridgette, answer me!
- ...and cook and a houseboy to pamper me when I arrive.

03:18.009 --> 03:19.867
- It's good to want things.
- Bridgette?

03:20.481 --> 03:21.547
She's okay.

03:22.136 --> 03:25.008
Honey, you've got clean clothes folded in the laundry basket.

03:25.086 --> 03:26.329
Go get dressed in my room.

03:26.877 --> 03:28.295
Freakazoid!

03:29.735 --> 03:30.999
I'll take care of this.

03:31.562 --> 03:32.884
Where you going?

03:49.860 --> 03:52.657
Mommy, what are you doing out there?

03:52.744 --> 03:54.347
I came to talk to you.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.893
Are you in your underwear?

03:59.344 --> 04:01.832
Aren't you worried someone might see?

04:02.031 --> 04:04.786
A little. But I'm more worried about you.

04:04.873 --> 04:06.941
Don't worried about me. I'm fine.

04:07.044 --> 04:09.917
I'm just going to stay in my room for the rest of my life.

04:11.028 --> 04:13.244
Oh... okay.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.953
Well, what do I tell your teacher?

04:17.928 --> 04:20.541
Daddy and I are supposed to meet with her this morning.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.096
I don't know.

04:22.732 --> 04:25.819
Tell her that... that I hate school.

04:26.357 --> 04:27.872
Okay, I'll tell her.

04:28.928 --> 04:30.760
And you're just going to stay in there?

04:31.497 --> 04:34.022
Even though Mommy and Daddy have to go to work

04:34.136 --> 04:36.239
and you'll be all alone in the house?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.955
You're okay with that?

04:39.234 --> 04:44.031
I would be scared to be all alone in the house without you.

04:44.154 --> 04:47.159
But if you're okay with that, I'll see you after work.

04:52.966 --> 04:55.101
Mom!!

04:57.042 --> 04:58.081
Yeah?

04:58.219 --> 05:00.657
Maybe I'll stay in my room for the rest of my life

05:00.738 --> 05:03.897
on a day when you don't have to go to work.

05:04.020 --> 05:06.412
Mm, okay. That makes sense.

05:06.622 --> 05:07.619
Tell you what.

05:07.752 --> 05:11.889
You go unlock the door and I'll come around and meet you and we'll have some breakfast, okay?

05:12.003 --> 05:13.794
- Okay.
- Okay. Go.

05:15.192 --> 05:16.810
She's smart as a whip.

05:17.445 --> 05:20.558
I actually think, in some ways, that may be part of the problem.

05:20.860 --> 05:24.127
I'm sorry. I guess we didn't know there was a problem.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.076
Not academically. Academically, she's stellar.

05:27.296 --> 05:30.316
But I am concerned with how she's doing socially.

05:30.485 --> 05:33.684
Working in groups. Playing with others. That sort of thing.

05:33.952 --> 05:36.945
She seems to have a hard time with it.

05:37.083 --> 05:37.910
Really?

05:38.130 --> 05:42.707
Mm-hmm. I've noticed she spends a lot of time alone, playing by herself.

05:42.932 --> 05:45.108
Is she like that at home?

05:47.908 --> 05:48.846
Yeah.

05:49.876 --> 05:53.182
She has a very active imagination. But that isn't bad, is it?

05:53.285 --> 05:55.455
No. Not necessarily,

05:55.942 --> 06:00.832
but... if a child is lonely, if they feel separate and apart...

06:01.119 --> 06:05.900
it becomes difficult for them to enjoy coming to class, being with others.

06:06.060 --> 06:10.643
So, I'm worried because she doesn't seem to have many friends.

06:11.748 --> 06:15.060
To be perfectly honest, she doesn't seem to have any friends.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.961
The other kids-- they avoid her.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.871
I should've seen it. I should've realized.

06:21.538 --> 06:24.758
I mean, I've always known that she was... unique.

06:24.902 --> 06:27.231
I just... No friends?

06:27.763 --> 06:31.701
With Ariel, it was so easy. She was somebody everybody always wanted to play with.

06:31.794 --> 06:34.629
All I had to do was sit back and wait for the phone to ring.

06:34.783 --> 06:35.971
This is my fault.

06:36.095 --> 06:39.185
I should've been out there, making play dates, arranging sleepovers.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.837
Wait a second. It's not like it's too late. She's in first grade, for goodness sake!

06:43.974 --> 06:46.323
You're right. You're right.

06:46.912 --> 06:48.852
I'll make some calls as soon as I get home.

06:48.946 --> 06:51.858
Call some of the other mothers. Maybe set something up for this weekend.

06:54.111 --> 06:55.223
Wait, wait!

06:55.878 --> 06:59.764
I have to go into the D.A.'s today. I got to drop Marie off at day care.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.370
Maybe this was not the greatest moment to go back to work.

07:02.473 --> 07:04.617
Hold on. Can we not blow this out of proportion?

07:04.730 --> 07:07.315
We have a problem. We have a plan to solve it.

07:07.424 --> 07:09.841
You'll make the calls tonight instead of an hour from now.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.028
End  of crisis.

07:11.145 --> 07:14.048
- What if I have to work late?
- Then I'll make some calls.

07:14.209 --> 07:17.817
We're talking about helping our six-year-old make friends, not curing cancer.

07:18.564 --> 07:19.747
We can do this.

07:20.832 --> 07:21.897
She's a good kid.

07:22.958 --> 07:24.837
The lady said "smart as a whip," did she not?

07:25.703 --> 07:26.383
Hey.

07:26.956 --> 07:28.211
Consider the gene pool.

07:30.004 --> 07:33.173
And you be sure and tell my esteemed colleague that confession or no confession,

07:33.223 --> 07:38.190
if I don't have his client's affidavit on my desk by 5:00 this afternoon, I'm pulling the offer.

07:38.922 --> 07:41.309
- You're here?
- I have been for over an hour.

07:41.779 --> 07:44.477
Boy, I told my assistant to call your house first thing this morning.

07:44.555 --> 07:46.014
- I had a thing at school.
- And she didn't try your cell?

07:46.117 --> 07:46.863
No.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.555
- And you couldn't just sense...?
- Apparently not.

07:51.322 --> 07:54.350
- So, basically, I'm here for nothing?
- No, not for nothing.

07:54.493 --> 07:55.962
I mean, you'll be paid.

07:57.651 --> 07:58.778
You know what? You're right.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.585
Since you're here, since you're getting paid...

08:00.673 --> 08:02.152
You know, I don't need a mercy job.

08:02.301 --> 08:04.854
Hey, I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for me.

08:05.076 --> 08:08.005
All I need to do is run for reelection and have someone find out I paid you

08:08.058 --> 08:10.579
and you didn't do anything to earn it. Are these the CCFs?

08:10.671 --> 08:11.449
Yes, sir.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.736
All right, now, all I need is a place to put you.

08:21.204 --> 08:22.408
Don't thank me now.

08:22.898 --> 08:23.954
You spoil me.

08:24.899 --> 08:28.418
Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. Old Wayne over there swears to me he actually likes it!

08:28.521 --> 08:30.831
Old Wayne? Sounds like something I used to drink.

08:30.902 --> 08:33.702
Criminal sketch artist. You'll be sharing this space with him.

08:35.212 --> 08:38.929
And what exactly is it you would have me do in this sumptuous space?

08:39.140 --> 08:40.624
You ever heard of "Cold Case Files"?

08:41.014 --> 08:42.600
Yeah,  but I never watched it.

08:42.683 --> 08:45.125
No, not the television show. These are the real thing.

08:45.213 --> 08:47.671
They're cases that are cold. Mysteries that are unsolved.

08:47.742 --> 08:50.455
Unsolved Mysteries. Never saw that either.

08:50.661 --> 08:53.901
What I'd like you to do is spend a little bit of time looking at each one of these files.

08:54.028 --> 08:57.091
- See if you get some sort of vibration off of it.
- Ooh, "vibration"?

08:57.910 --> 09:00.987
Whatever it is you get, when you get, whatever it is you get.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.901
- Got it.
- Good. I'll be in my office.

09:03.132 --> 09:04.939
That would be that room with all the windows?

09:05.277 --> 09:06.241
Right you are.

09:21.708 --> 09:23.377
All right, let's get started.

09:24.114 --> 09:28.457
I'll try, but like I was telling the officers, it's not like I got a really good look at him.

09:28.805 --> 09:32.077
It was dark, and I was hiding from him. And then I was running from him.

09:32.183 --> 09:34.697
It's all right. Just do the best you can do.

09:34.887 --> 09:39.198
Let's start with something easy. Let's start with, uh, hair color.

09:39.444 --> 09:42.433
According to the investigating officer's police report,

09:42.526 --> 09:45.788
you said the perpetrator had blond hair?

09:45.926 --> 09:48.752
Yeah. Brownish blond. I think so.

09:49.044 --> 09:49.986
You think so?

09:50.349 --> 09:51.963
No. That's it. Definitely.

09:52.516 --> 09:53.652
Brownish blond.

09:54.358 --> 09:55.397
And short.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.823
So we're talking about a Caucasian?

09:58.922 --> 10:00.241
You mean a white man?

10:00.940 --> 10:02.794
Yeah, he was a white man.

10:03.543 --> 10:05.789
What about his stature?

10:06.032 --> 10:10.400
Are we talking tall man, short man, fat man, thin man?

10:11.552 --> 10:12.524
It's okay.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.301
Just relax and concentrate on what happened.

10:17.409 --> 10:21.648
Mister... he killed my fiancé right in front of me.

10:22.718 --> 10:25.462
My clothes have pieces of his brain on them.

10:26.672 --> 10:29.098
You relax and concentrate.

10:30.091 --> 10:31.744
Miss, uh...

11:09.608 --> 11:12.654
He was a short man, really.

11:12.712 --> 11:13.724
Average to short.

11:16.202 --> 11:17.504
Just a white guy.

11:18.993 --> 11:21.107
An average to short white guy.

11:22.418 --> 11:25.332
Okay. What else can you remember?

11:25.736 --> 11:28.102
Eyes, maybe? Eye color?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.851
Did he have all of his teeth?

11:31.016 --> 11:34.303
What about his ears? Were they especially large?

11:34.936 --> 11:37.537
Just... take your time.

11:40.724 --> 11:42.151
Let me think...

11:59.079 --> 12:01.567
I'd have to say he looked like a farm boy to me.

12:02.177 --> 12:06.830
You know, like one of those Midwestern-looking types...

12:07.377 --> 12:09.989
with nice teeth and short hair.

12:15.305 --> 12:17.798
It's all coming back to me now.

12:24.536 --> 12:29.480
Anyway, my wife and I thought it might be fun for our girls to get together outside of school.

12:30.683 --> 12:31.873
Bridgette, yeah.

12:32.624 --> 12:34.924
Great. Let's see, uh...

12:35.190 --> 12:37.786
Um, how about... Sorry?

12:38.608 --> 12:42.501
No, no, actually, Bridgette doesn't have an online calendar.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.602
Does sound like a time saver. We'll look into it.

12:46.981 --> 12:48.553
Oh, so how about Saturday?

12:49.730 --> 12:51.995
She has horseback riding till noon? Huh.

12:52.160 --> 12:57.355
Um, then, book club... right. Ah, what about Sunday?

12:59.726 --> 13:01.257
A fund-raiser?

13:01.738 --> 13:05.976
Wow, I didn't know that six-year-olds did...

13:08.647 --> 13:12.950
No. I can definitely see how that would help flesh out a high school transcript. Sure.

13:13.857 --> 13:15.899
Uh... what about the next weekend?

13:17.927 --> 13:19.473
You can pencil her in?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.632
Yeah, okay, sure.

13:23.528 --> 13:25.018
No, no, it's Dubois.

13:26.176 --> 13:28.198
Uh, that's a different Bridgette.

13:30.999 --> 13:32.324
Sure, yeah.

13:32.602 --> 13:34.588
Probably should talk to Cassie first.

13:35.489 --> 13:38.132
Well, yeah, call me if she's interested.

13:38.950 --> 13:39.918
You, too.

13:40.799 --> 13:41.658
Bye.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.705
Everyone brush your teeth?

13:55.667 --> 13:58.422
Ah, my prayers have been answered.

13:58.524 --> 14:00.997
A woman sneaking into my room.

14:01.412 --> 14:05.169
And wonder of wonders, she actually looks like my wife.

14:05.379 --> 14:07.156
The better to ease the guilt.

14:08.365 --> 14:09.537
God is good.

14:11.711 --> 14:14.944
You  missed some amazing franks and some even better beans.

14:15.595 --> 14:17.632
We waited at the table for you to show up.

14:17.739 --> 14:20.750
We waited for, I don't know, three hours?

14:21.508 --> 14:25.142
But by then the flies were getting so thick, the kids started to complain,

14:25.224 --> 14:28.670
and it was like, oh, heck, let's just eat without Mommy.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.188
I'm sorry.

14:45.382 --> 14:49.601
I've been looking at mug shot books for the last five hours.

14:50.082 --> 14:53.760
This witness, this woman was caught up in this...

14:55.156 --> 14:56.375
e xecution.

14:57.001 --> 14:59.873
Her fiancé was murdered right in front of her.

15:00.467 --> 15:04.399
And she's giving this description to the police of the perpetrator.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.502
And I'm listening and I'm realizing

15:07.784 --> 15:10.999
the man she's describing is not the man inside her head.

15:11.101 --> 15:11.812
Al...

15:11.900 --> 15:15.731
And I can't very well go to the sketch artist and say, um, "I read her mind.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.414
Draw a guy who looks like this."

15:18.874 --> 15:23.446
So, I looked through all the mug shot books, hoping...

15:23.937 --> 15:26.558
And then I looked up and it's 10:30.

15:27.516 --> 15:29.974
And now the police are looking for the wrong guy.

15:30.598 --> 15:32.345
She's probably scared, Al.

15:32.621 --> 15:35.095
I know, but I gotta think of something.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.530
You want to hear some good news?

15:39.779 --> 15:41.402
Bridgette made a friend.

15:45.068 --> 15:47.807
- No.
- Yeah. Talk about timing, huh?

15:48.073 --> 15:50.434
Oh, she came home from school all excited.

15:50.655 --> 15:53.343
They played on the playground. They ate lunch together.

15:53.496 --> 15:55.421
She can't wait to go to school tomorrow.

15:55.544 --> 15:58.217
Oh, God, that's great! And I wasn't here.

15:58.298 --> 16:01.079
It's okay. She'll tell you all about him in the morning.

16:01.175 --> 16:02.999
Yeah, it's a him?

16:03.085 --> 16:03.972
Bobby!

16:04.298 --> 16:06.706
Bobby. Bobby who?

16:06.823 --> 16:11.257
We don't have a last name yet, but she promised to get it and a phone number tomorrow.

16:11.370 --> 16:15.185
With any luck, he'll still have some openings in the fourth quarter of his fiscal year.

16:15.362 --> 16:17.574
Mm, this is great.

16:18.486 --> 16:20.980
Maybe I'll see him tomorrow when I drop her off at school.

16:21.069 --> 16:22.229
I'm sure you will.

16:23.356 --> 16:25.235
Now may I have a kiss?

16:26.013 --> 16:27.949
- What?
- A kiss.

16:28.158 --> 16:31.718
That thing we used to do when we saw each other after a long day.

16:33.453 --> 16:35.122
I like Bobby.

16:38.037 --> 16:39.792
It sounds nice.

16:40.201 --> 16:41.461
He sounds nice.

16:41.572 --> 16:42.956
You can't have him.

16:43.410 --> 16:45.341
He's already involved with your daughter.

16:45.721 --> 16:48.746
And, besides, you're already involved with me.

17:09.416 --> 17:11.659
It's not even 7:30. Why are we so early?

17:11.823 --> 17:14.633
Because I have to work today. Besides it's only a few minutes.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.781
More like 20. What are we supposed to do for 20 whole entire minutes?

17:17.858 --> 17:20.858
I don't know. Look, kids are playing in the playground!

17:21.003 --> 17:22.932
Uh, little kids.

17:23.117 --> 17:26.705
I'm sure you'll think of something. And don't forget, Dad is picking you up today.

17:26.829 --> 17:29.030
- How come?
- Because I have a big day at work,

17:29.106 --> 17:32.881
and he's gonna bring home things he can do there, so try not to make too much noise.

17:33.312 --> 17:33.992
Okay.

17:34.883 --> 17:36.332
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, lips.

17:37.241 --> 17:38.135
Where's my kiss?

17:38.774 --> 17:39.215
Bye.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.476
Bye, Mom.

17:45.850 --> 17:47.161
Bye, wild thing.

18:17.166 --> 18:18.720
Wow. You are really good.

18:19.674 --> 18:22.842
Hi. Um, I'm sitting over there temporarily.

18:22.940 --> 18:25.351
Allison. I think we missed each other the other day.

18:25.448 --> 18:26.231
Wayne.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.499
It's amazing you can do that.

18:32.765 --> 18:34.352
I  been at it a long time.

18:34.630 --> 18:35.617
What do you do?

18:36.007 --> 18:40.250
Oh, I'm a consultant. I work part-time with the D.A. It's pretty boring.

18:40.741 --> 18:42.959
Could I ask you kind of a nutty question?

18:43.056 --> 18:47.546
- What's that?
- Do you ever, like, draw for money?

18:47.776 --> 18:50.261
What, you mean like ads or something?

18:50.779 --> 18:53.976
I have this idea-- I don't mean to put you on the spot--

18:54.085 --> 18:56.137
but it's my husband's birthday tomorrow.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.134
And he's one of those people who's impossible to shop for.

18:59.615 --> 19:00.720
Could I give you a...?

19:00.853 --> 19:04.003
You have a picture or something, like maybe a photo from your wallet?

19:04.248 --> 19:04.971
No.

19:05.609 --> 19:08.661
I was hoping maybe I could describe him to you...

19:10.987 --> 19:11.902
All right.

19:16.193 --> 19:20.709
Okay. Let's start with his, um... complexion.

19:21.052 --> 19:22.460
How would you describe that?

19:22.917 --> 19:26.151
Well, it's very similar to yours actually.

19:28.932 --> 19:30.544
Let me see if I've got this straight.

19:30.965 --> 19:33.893
This is the man we should be looking for, not this man?

19:34.661 --> 19:36.458
Then who do you suppose this is?

19:36.740 --> 19:38.229
I think it's Matt Damon.

19:39.413 --> 19:42.249
I left a magazine laying around and I think the witness saw it and...

19:42.331 --> 19:43.722
Oh, for crying out loud.

19:45.868 --> 19:49.259
Okay, let's say you're right. Let's say the witness lied and her sketch is bogus.

19:49.335 --> 19:52.592
Well, she's not lying exactly. She's just afraid of being involved.

19:52.663 --> 19:55.214
Allison, that's lying. Exactly.

19:55.387 --> 19:58.438
Besides, whatever her reasons are, my hands are really tied.

19:58.519 --> 19:59.458
What do you mean?

20:00.164 --> 20:01.900
Well, what would you have me do with this?

20:02.079 --> 20:06.421
I don t know. Publish it. Distribute it. Go get the cops to go get the guy.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.200
Allison, I can't put this out. Where would I say it came from?

20:10.573 --> 20:12.463
An anonymous eyewitness.

20:12.615 --> 20:14.080
Oh, right.

20:14.321 --> 20:17.649
The description from the person in the room-- that's the one I tell the police to ignore.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.269
And the description from someone whose identity I can't discuss--

20:20.357 --> 20:22.400
- that's the one I want them to pay attention to.
- But...

20:22.509 --> 20:25.932
Then what? What happens if we manage to find the guy and make an arrest?

20:26.030 --> 20:28.140
What happens when the defense attorney puts you on the stand?

20:28.226 --> 20:29.072
What do you say?

20:29.190 --> 20:31.719
Better yet, what happens when he puts the woman on the stand and she says,

20:31.791 --> 20:33.675
"That's not the man I described"?

20:34.402 --> 20:35.457
I don't know.

20:35.778 --> 20:39.476
All I know is, you're looking for the wrong man.

20:39.967 --> 20:41.293
Well, maybe you're right.

20:42.322 --> 20:45.024
But if this is the real man we should be looking for,

20:45.516 --> 20:48.257
then we need to get the real eyewitness to say so.

21:00.706 --> 21:04.360
- I got a C-plus on my math test.
- C-plus? All right.

21:04.892 --> 21:05.885
That's progress.

21:06.368 --> 21:07.231
Where's your sister?

21:08.117 --> 21:10.559
- Playground, probably.
- Come on, let's go find her.

21:18.265 --> 21:19.790
You're it! You can't catch me.

21:24.552 --> 21:26.007
You can't touch me.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.266
Bridgette!

21:37.368 --> 21:40.328
God. Why does she have to be so weird all the time?

21:51.002 --> 21:54.402
It doesn't sound like that big a deal. So she was playing by herself.

21:55.417 --> 21:57.219
Did you ask her what happened to Bobby?

21:57.602 --> 22:01.151
Maybe he went home sick, or maybe he was playing with some little boys.

22:02.334 --> 22:05.119
That doesn't mean that he doesn't want to play with her anymore.

22:05.269 --> 22:06.071
I'm just saying...

22:06.218 --> 22:09.507
Bridgette, did you get to ask Bobby what his last name was?

22:09.621 --> 22:12.793
It's Lechelle. Bobby Lechelle.

22:13.187 --> 22:14.452
Let's see.

22:15.620 --> 22:18.667
Oh. Perfect. There's only one Lechelle.

22:18.952 --> 22:19.819
Call!

22:20.025 --> 22:21.068
Why don't you call?

22:21.528 --> 22:22.972
- You're a big girl.
- Okay.

22:25.114 --> 22:30.595
Okay, I'll read you the numbers. Ready? 5-5-5-0-1-9-6.

22:36.198 --> 22:37.380
It's ringing.

22:40.042 --> 22:43.681
Hello? Is Bobby home? This is Bridgette.

22:44.477 --> 22:47.176
Bobby! He's my friend.

22:49.904 --> 22:51.649
She wants to talk to you.

22:52.786 --> 22:57.491
Hi, Mrs. Lechelle? This is, uh, Allison Dubois. I'm Bridgette's mom.

22:58.803 --> 23:00.026
No, I don't...

23:00.630 --> 23:02.924
A joke? Of course not.

23:04.552 --> 23:08.168
I'm sorry. I don't understand. You don't have a son at Central?

23:12.365 --> 23:13.297
You do?

23:15.232 --> 23:16.241
You did.

23:24.516 --> 23:25.754
I'm sorry.

23:27.342 --> 23:29.947
I'm  terribly, terribly sorry.

23:32.964 --> 23:34.033
What was that about?

23:37.428 --> 23:41.939
Bridgette, baby, go brush your teeth and get ready for bed. I'll come read you a book.

23:46.793 --> 23:47.406
What?

23:48.580 --> 23:49.557
He's dead.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.992
Oh, my, God, what happened?

23:54.319 --> 23:55.690
Five years ago.

23:57.125 --> 23:59.752
He died five years ago.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.609
Do you think she knows?

24:13.673 --> 24:17.580
I doubt it. She probably just thinks he's another kid on the playground.

24:20.365 --> 24:22.985
- Well, we have to tell her.
- I guess.

24:23.406 --> 24:24.348
You guess?

24:25.398 --> 24:27.123
You don't think this is a problem?

24:27.471 --> 24:30.810
We should just be happy that she has a new friend and leave it at that?

24:32.587 --> 24:35.131
- We have to do something about this.
- I know.

24:35.219 --> 24:37.323
All right, okay, fine, so we're on the same page, then.

24:41.352 --> 24:46.584
Any thoughts as to why who's been dead for five years should choose to hang around our daughter?

24:46.661 --> 24:48.356
You make it sound so sinister.

24:48.484 --> 24:51.976
He's drawn to her because she can see him, that's all.

24:52.162 --> 24:54.644
I don't know if you're aware of this, but right now you sounded almost...

24:55.156 --> 24:57.905
- I don't know, almost proud of her.
- Please.

24:58.107 --> 25:02.487
I wouldn't wish the way I see the world on anybody, least of all my own daughter.

25:02.579 --> 25:04.945
So what's next, she gonna start finishing my sentences for me?

25:05.052 --> 25:09.073
Start knowing things before they happen, start waking up in a cold sweat from bizarre dreams?

25:09.179 --> 25:11.335
You don't know that any of those things are going to happen.

25:11.473 --> 25:13.050
Well, I'm allowed to wonder.

25:13.634 --> 25:15.247
And I'm allowed to worry.

25:17.689 --> 25:19.543
In fact, I'd be an idiot not to worry.

25:20.044 --> 25:21.938
Got it. Sorry.

25:23.183 --> 25:27.207
- Sorry to have polluted the gene pool.
- Didn't mean it like that.

25:27.366 --> 25:28.932
How else could you mean it?

25:30.453 --> 25:32.712
How do you know she's not gonna outgrow it?

25:33.321 --> 25:36.945
And just because you see one ghost doesn't mean you see every ghost.

25:37.063 --> 25:37.928
If you say so.

25:38.148 --> 25:41.931
Just because you have one dream that seems to come true doesn't mean every dream comes true.

25:42.035 --> 25:45.935
I had dream the other night, a wolf was chasing me through the airport trying to kill me.

25:46.049 --> 25:47.451
Didn't mean a damn thing.

25:49.582 --> 25:52.080
Although you are looking kind of wolfish.

25:52.213 --> 25:53.376
I'm going to check on Bridgette.

25:56.238 --> 25:59.940
So it just isn't gonna work out with Bobby this weekend.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.153
How come?

26:02.618 --> 26:04.043
It just isn't.

26:05.234 --> 26:06.539
But I was thinking,

26:07.035 --> 26:10.450
is there somebody else you like, somebody else at school?

26:11.752 --> 26:14.926
No, Mommy. The other kids are mean.

26:15.034 --> 26:17.138
All the other kids are mean.

26:17.358 --> 26:20.337
Bobby is the only one who's nice to me.

26:20.818 --> 26:22.774
What about next weekend?

26:22.892 --> 26:24.864
Can Bobby and me play then?

26:27.547 --> 26:31.909
I don't know, Honey. We'll see tomorrow. It's late, go to sleep.

26:48.551 --> 26:49.286
Ready?

26:50.346 --> 26:52.404
- She's in the conference room.
- Absolutely.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.179
This is gonna be a bit tricky.

26:55.267 --> 26:59.931
I have no factual ground on which to question the validity of the sketch she approved.

27:00.053 --> 27:03.337
Show her my sketch, see how she reacts to a picture of the real killer.

27:03.427 --> 27:07.667
Love to-- only down the line the defense attorney could say that I influenced the witness.

27:07.810 --> 27:09.346
We can't even show it to her?

27:09.470 --> 27:11.379
I didn't say we; I said I.

27:16.295 --> 27:20.329
Do you remember the affidavit you signed when the sketch artist showed you the finished picture yesterday?

27:20.416 --> 27:24.961
The one on which you swear that the description you gave is, to the best of your knowledge, accurate?

27:25.961 --> 27:27.928
Well, we lost that affidavit.

27:28.132 --> 27:33.124
I feel terrible about the inconvenience, but I'm afraid that I have to ask you to sign it again.

27:40.118 --> 27:45.105
Is this the man you saw shoot your fiancé in cold blood the night of the 12th?

27:45.571 --> 27:46.810
Yeah, that's him.

27:46.995 --> 27:48.408
Any changes you'd like to make?

27:48.508 --> 27:49.236
No.

27:49.411 --> 27:52.237
Any details that have come back to you since yesterday?

27:52.954 --> 27:54.515
Not really, no.

27:54.694 --> 27:57.592
Are you sure? I'd be happy to bring in the artist you worked with.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.919
If you had any additional thoughts, now would be the time to share them.

28:02.621 --> 28:06.625
No. I'm very happy with the sketch. If you'll let me just sign the paper...

28:09.886 --> 28:10.799
Allison...

28:16.817 --> 28:18.026
Oh, my goodness.

28:19.292 --> 28:20.291
Here you go.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.102
Thank you.

28:30.294 --> 28:31.821
- Thank you.
- Allison.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.656
Is there anything else, or can I go?

28:35.944 --> 28:39.510
Yeah... you could take another look.

28:39.684 --> 28:42.531
- Excuse me?
- Isn't this the man that killed your fiancé?

28:42.701 --> 28:45.045
I don't understand what's going on here-- I signed your paper.

28:45.164 --> 28:46.833
I'm sorry, you're free to leave at any time.

28:46.986 --> 28:50.872
Listen, I know you're afraid, but if you don't help us, he may very well kill somebody else.

28:51.041 --> 28:52.685
I am helping you-- I'm here, aren't I?

28:52.782 --> 28:57.261
- Without you making an accurate identification... 
- I did make an accurate identification.

28:59.729 --> 29:03.866
There is no one on this planet that wants to see that man behind bars more than me.

29:04.347 --> 29:08.094
There is no one more frightened of seeing that man again than me.

29:08.870 --> 29:10.486
I've done all that I can.

29:12.003 --> 29:13.498
Have you caught him yet?

29:14.292 --> 29:17.015
Do you even know his name? Do you even know where he lives?

29:17.419 --> 29:22.150
Can you promise me that he isn't in the parking lot waiting for me right now?

29:27.219 --> 29:28.628
I didn't think so.

29:30.005 --> 29:34.976
So, if he kills again, it won't be my fault, now, will it?

29:48.140 --> 29:49.773
- Is not!
- Is so!

29:49.850 --> 29:51.545
- Is not!
- Is so!

29:51.610 --> 29:52.747
- Is not!
- Is so!

29:52.829 --> 29:54.954
- Is not!
- Is so!

29:55.070 --> 29:56.957
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Is not!

29:57.120 --> 30:01.595
Mom, tell her-- tell there is no best friend! There is no play date! There is no Bobby!

30:01.676 --> 30:02.829
Ariel, enough.

30:03.664 --> 30:06.040
- Joe...
- Is so a Bobby!

30:07.728 --> 30:09.152
Stop it, girls.

30:10.704 --> 30:12.721
Stop it...!

30:13.433 --> 30:17.806
Stop. Ariel, go to your room now. Do your homework. Now!

30:18.261 --> 30:19.417
Bridgette, go.

30:19.678 --> 30:21.425
Get your coat. You're coming with me.

30:21.646 --> 30:23.192
Where are you taking me?

30:23.539 --> 30:24.600
To jail?

30:25.695 --> 30:27.625
Just... get your coat.

30:29.438 --> 30:30.698
What's your plan, Stan?

30:32.909 --> 30:33.846
I don't know.

30:33.934 --> 30:38.113
I figure if Bobby's gonna be her best friend, then I should go have a chat with him.

30:39.191 --> 30:40.102
Bridgette?

30:40.814 --> 30:41.609
Bridgette?

30:42.619 --> 30:43.466
Move it.

31:01.859 --> 31:03.947
I don't see him. Do you?

31:04.152 --> 31:08.549
Of course not, Mommy. It's night. He's probably at home, in bed, asleep.

31:10.357 --> 31:12.359
That's the thing, honey. He isn't.

31:12.554 --> 31:13.731
He never sleeps.

31:14.352 --> 31:15.713
He's afraid to.

31:15.944 --> 31:19.671
He's afraid if he allows himself to sleep, he'll wake up somewhere far, far away

31:19.742 --> 31:23.055
and he'll never see you again and he'll never see his parents again.

31:23.277 --> 31:24.273
He's scared.

31:25.165 --> 31:29.009
Well, I'd be scared, too, if I thought I was going far, far away.

31:29.229 --> 31:32.353
But that's the thing, see. When you go to this place...

31:32.584 --> 31:37.663
you can actually see everybody. Any time you want, and you're never lonely.

31:37.888 --> 31:39.276
It's a good place.

31:39.916 --> 31:41.288
And it's his time.

31:42.113 --> 31:44.446
And we have to help him get there.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.696
Hey, Bridgette. Who's that?

31:59.541 --> 32:01.502
Hey, Bobby. This is my mom.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.606
Hi, Bobby.

32:07.415 --> 32:08.346
I know.

32:08.987 --> 32:12.775
It's been a while since a grown-up saw you, spoke to you, right?

32:15.224 --> 32:17.103
I bet you miss your mom.

32:18.224 --> 32:19.985
I know she misses you.

32:20.641 --> 32:23.253
She cries for you. She prays for you.

32:23.790 --> 32:26.328
But you can't hear any of that here, can you?

32:28.659 --> 32:33.692
You need to be in a place where you can hear everything... see everyone.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.312
There is a place like that, you know.

32:37.024 --> 32:40.178
And there are a lot of people waiting for you to show up there.

32:40.685 --> 32:42.252
Your grandpa and grandma.

32:42.656 --> 32:45.601
Lots of other relatives you've never even met.

32:46.733 --> 32:48.382
It's a wonderful place.

32:49.599 --> 32:53.737
And to get there, all you have to do is to relax.

32:54.187 --> 32:55.544
And let go.

32:56.722 --> 32:58.073
Close your eyes.

32:59.732 --> 33:01.381
Aren't you tired?

33:04.371 --> 33:05.416
Come here.

33:13.458 --> 33:17.099
But, Mommy... I don't want Bobby to go away.

33:19.121 --> 33:22.327
Where he's going, he will always be with you.

33:22.506 --> 33:25.762
In your memories, and in your heart. He will be watching you.

33:26.492 --> 33:31.132
And if you miss him... all you'll need to do is think of him.

33:32.234 --> 33:33.067
Okay?

33:36.320 --> 33:38.066
Okay. Let's go lay down.

35:11.178 --> 35:12.100
It's for you.

35:12.599 --> 35:13.539
Who is it?

35:13.690 --> 35:15.234
Oh, I think it's your witness.

35:24.488 --> 35:27.280
- Ticket and ID, please.
- I'm not actually flying tonight.

35:27.363 --> 35:29.841
My name's Allison Dubois. I'm with the DA's office.

35:29.963 --> 35:32.933
I'm here to secure an affidavit from a witness who's leaving the country.

35:33.021 --> 35:35.811
I was told that my office called ahead to let you know I was coming.

35:42.979 --> 35:46.522
- I came as quickly as I could.
- Thank you. Thanks for coming.

35:46.926 --> 35:49.697
I feel safe here... you know? They check for guns.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.026
My plane boards in 20 minutes. Let's just get this over with.

35:56.208 --> 35:58.206
That is the man, isn't it?

36:00.823 --> 36:05.411
Just so we're clear... I'm not coming back to testify until you've got him locked up.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.018
Till you've got him where he can't hurt me.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.579
Everybody understands.

36:13.086 --> 36:15.661
I know you think I'm crazy, running way like this.

36:15.788 --> 36:17.002
I know what happened...

36:18.758 --> 36:22.127
I mean, I wasn't there, but I read your statement.

36:22.245 --> 36:23.129
He knows me.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.166
He looked right at me.

36:34.711 --> 36:36.791
That night, I was supposed to be dead.

36:37.113 --> 36:38.306
He meant to kill me.

36:43.555 --> 36:45.086
He means to kill me.

36:45.613 --> 36:48.259
Who is this guy? Do you know him?

36:48.368 --> 36:49.975
I mean... what sort of a criminal is he?

36:50.106 --> 36:52.454
He's the worst kind. He's a cop.

36:53.375 --> 36:57.061
I don't know his name or anything, but I know he's an undercover detective in Vice.

36:57.184 --> 37:00.307
My boyfriend told me that nobody moves any kind of narcotic

37:00.368 --> 37:02.770
in south Arizona unless he gets a taste of it.

37:06.622 --> 37:08.642
I'm sorry I lied to you.

37:08.928 --> 37:10.552
I didn't know what else to do.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.044
A tisket, a tasket

37:17.203 --> 37:19.987
A green and yellow basket

37:20.067 --> 37:22.734
I wrote a letter to my love

37:27.598 --> 37:29.005
Can't be too careful.

37:32.419 --> 37:33.556
Wait a second.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.537
What did you say the detective's name was?

37:37.504 --> 37:40.807
Wolfe. Detective Wolfe. I'm here on official police business.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.977
Hey... did you say Wolfe?

37:46.194 --> 37:47.689
Hey, wait a sec.

37:47.887 --> 37:50.976
You know what? Let me walk you to the gate. I just have this feeling...

38:25.418 --> 38:27.605
Police officer! Stop or I'll shoot!

38:41.382 --> 38:43.087
- Don't stop!
- What do you mean?!

38:43.143 --> 38:44.178
Just trust me.

39:05.689 --> 39:09.210
An eyewitness to murder and an employee of the District Attorney's office

39:09.276 --> 39:11.458
narrowly escaped death here at the airport...

39:11.544 --> 39:15.492
If I don't see some bodies fully dressed and making their way to the car in the next 30 seconds...

39:15.580 --> 39:17.621
...to get the witness's signature on some legal documents.

39:17.703 --> 39:21.391
- Unknown to both women, they were being followed...
- Mom... I don't feel good.

39:21.467 --> 39:23.018
You never feel good.

39:23.085 --> 39:25.265
In the car, or nobody's going to feel good.

39:25.367 --> 39:28.861
...a Phoenix Police detective gave chase and the two women found themselves trapped

39:28.927 --> 39:33.177
at the end of an unoccupied jetway dangling three stories in the air.

39:33.257 --> 39:36.965
- Did anyone remember to shut off the TV?
- Fate and a passing luggage carrier intervened, and...

39:44.994 --> 39:48.107
- Don't forget to give that envelope to Mrs. Cass.
- Okay. Bye.

39:48.434 --> 39:49.858
- Bye.
- See you later.

39:49.980 --> 39:51.458
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:52.185 --> 39:56.023
Ding-ding-ding. Last stop. Everybody out.

39:56.119 --> 39:59.283
- You lied to me.
- About what?

39:59.421 --> 40:01.418
You said he'll always be with me.

40:02.545 --> 40:06.759
He is, honey. He's with you right now, watching out for you.

40:07.256 --> 40:10.374
Well, I don't see him.

40:10.603 --> 40:11.828
Well, he's there.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.527
And he's there.

40:15.177 --> 40:16.579
And he's there.

40:19.447 --> 40:21.217
Now, give Mommy a kiss.

40:25.498 --> 40:27.234
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

40:27.377 --> 40:28.228
See ya.

40:43.312 --> 40:44.734
Whatcha doin'?

40:46.312 --> 40:49.102
We said... whatcha doin'?

40:49.460 --> 40:50.659
Mmm, nothin'.

40:50.956 --> 40:52.891
Why aren't you playing with your friend?

40:53.172 --> 40:55.287
He had to go away somewhere...

40:57.340 --> 40:58.825
Okay, I'll tell her.

40:59.086 --> 41:01.728
You can play with me and my friend if you want.

41:01.912 --> 41:03.079
What friend?

41:03.653 --> 41:05.486
He's 'maginary.

41:05.610 --> 41:08.287
His name's Wilbur. He's a giraffe.

41:08.563 --> 41:09.869
What kind of giraffe?

41:09.987 --> 41:11.483
The spotted kind.

41:11.645 --> 41:13.284
The kind that lives in Africa?

41:13.371 --> 41:16.509
Well, of course Africa. That's where spotted giraffes are from.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
