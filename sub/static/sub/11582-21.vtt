(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:04.205 --> 00:06.640
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.776
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.809 --> 00:10.744
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.778 --> 00:12.346
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.380 --> 00:14.648
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.485
These are their stories.

00:17.518 --> 00:21.255
[loud rock music]

00:21.289 --> 00:23.291
Where do you think
you're goin'?

00:23.324 --> 00:24.125
Leave me alone.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.060
You know what
I want from you, bitch.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.128
Stop, please!

00:27.161 --> 00:28.496
Come on, give it to me.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.530
No!

00:31.599 --> 00:32.700
No!

00:32.733 --> 00:35.436
[police siren wails]

00:35.469 --> 00:36.704
Let's get out of here.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.339
We'll take the car!

00:41.542 --> 00:42.510
[car starting]

00:42.543 --> 00:43.644
My baby...

00:50.851 --> 00:51.819
My baby!

00:51.852 --> 00:53.287
[crying]

00:53.321 --> 00:55.823
Joey!

00:55.856 --> 00:58.659
Joey!

01:04.198 --> 01:06.134
(Fin)
Victim's name
is Samantha Beavan, 21.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.468
Two freaks attacked her
in the club.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.769
She got away,
they followed her,

01:08.802 --> 01:09.737
stole her car,

01:09.770 --> 01:12.140
and threw her nine-month-old
baby out the back.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.707
He survive?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.443
He's still breathing.
Car seat saved him.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.578
Mom and kid are on their way
to St. Vincent's.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.580
They rape her in the club?

01:19.613 --> 01:21.782
She was orally sodomized
in the stairwell.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.417
But so far, no witnesses.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.752
She have any idea
who attacked her?

01:24.785 --> 01:25.853
Nah.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.321
She said she couldn't
see their faces.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.456
Might have an eyewitness.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.424
Security camera covers that
service entrance over there.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.793
We'll pull the tape.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.163
What makes a mother
leave her baby in the car

01:35.196 --> 01:36.630
while she goes out clubbing?

01:36.664 --> 01:38.266
(Nurse)
No broken bones
or head trauma.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.600
He's one tough kid.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.535
Thrown from a moving car,
not even a whimper.

01:41.569 --> 01:42.636
(Benson)
And what about Sam?

01:42.670 --> 01:43.671
Pretty shook up,

01:43.704 --> 01:44.705
but only cuts and bruises.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.207
Did you do a rape kit?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.475
She wanted to
nurse Joey first.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.742
Ms. Beavan,
two detectives to see you.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.313
She was just here.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.814
How many exits?
Two.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.716
Main entrance and
the ambulance bay in back.

01:55.749 --> 01:56.717
I'll take the front.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.489
Sam?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.191
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.258
Sam. I'm Olivia Benson.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.659
I'm a police officer

02:05.693 --> 02:06.594
and I'd like to ask you
some questions.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.728
I'm okay.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.530
You were sexually assaulted
and you need to be examined.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.531
But I just--I wanna go home.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.665
I understand that.

02:11.699 --> 02:12.666
I just need to ask you
a couple questions

02:12.700 --> 02:14.635
about the men
who attacked you.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.237
Please. Joey's real tired.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.605
Let me take him home.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.340
Maybe you should have
thought about Joey

02:19.373 --> 02:20.674
before you left him
in a car.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.509
I know, it was stupid.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.377
But I-I was only
going to be a minute.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.378
They were looking for
a bartender

02:24.412 --> 02:25.513
and I really need the money--

02:25.546 --> 02:26.580
(Dr. Iqbal)
Miss Beavan.
Miss Beavan.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.250
You need to come inside.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.718
No. We're both fine.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.320
Your son isn't.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.288
His tox screen
was positive for opiates.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.257
Painkillers.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.325
I don't understand.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.826
I'd never give Joey any drugs.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.328
Sam.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.230
You were breast-feeding.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.798
You could have killed him.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.852
(Cragen)
Sam Beavan is waiting
in the interview room.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.953
What took you so long?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.455
ACS found two priors.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.023
Social worker
had to remove the baby.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.926
Sam has a bad habit
of leaving Joey alone.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.328
Security tape from the alley.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.629
Really did a number on her.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.364
(Cragen)
You get a look at their faces?

03:50.398 --> 03:51.699
Nope, this is it.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.934
Before you ask,
no sign of the car.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.370
Sam tell you why
she was using painkillers?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.539
She slipped down
some subway steps.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.640
Hurt her back,
doctor prescribed oxycodone,

03:59.673 --> 04:01.008
she got hooked.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.777
Along with more than
a million other illegal users.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.379
They call it Hillbilly Heroin.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.314
You crush it, snort it,

04:06.347 --> 04:09.550
get 12 hours worth of pain meds
in one hit.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.751
So we investigate a rape

04:10.784 --> 04:12.286
while we prosecute her
for child endangerment.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.821
(Benson)
Or we get her into treatment

04:13.854 --> 04:15.289
and find the guys
who attacked her.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.357
That baby could have died

04:16.390 --> 04:17.658
while Mommy
was trying to score.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.992
So we punish her
for being raped?

04:19.026 --> 04:21.395
Look again.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.336
They're pattin' her down.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.903
They're drug dealers.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.971
She probably owed them.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.940
Which means she knows 'em.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.408
Get the tape
over to TARU,

04:34.442 --> 04:36.310
see if they can
give us faces.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.646
Liv, Elliot, go jog
the young lady's memory

04:38.679 --> 04:40.848
about her attackers.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.552
I told that other detective
I never saw them before.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.886
It was dark.
They grabbed me.

04:45.919 --> 04:46.987
Right, and you told us

04:47.020 --> 04:48.088
you went to the club

04:48.121 --> 04:49.990
looking for a job.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.525
Owner says
they never had one,

04:51.559 --> 04:53.494
so why don't we
start again, okay?

04:53.527 --> 04:55.429
You went to the club
lookin' to buy drugs--

04:55.463 --> 04:56.597
No, I was attacked!

04:56.630 --> 04:58.732
Why are you treating me
like I'm a criminal?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.768
Because your baby's toxicology
report makes you one.

05:00.801 --> 05:01.835
(Benson)
Sam.

05:01.869 --> 05:05.473
You still put your baby at risk.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.408
Now, if you help us,
we can help you.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.943
I'll call social services,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.379
we'll get you into rehab.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.680
The sooner you do that,

05:12.713 --> 05:15.749
the sooner
you get baby Joey back.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.952
What do I have to do?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.622
Tell us who attacked you.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.963
His name's Jake Lumet.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.999
Sometimes he sells me pills.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.835
And the other one?

05:34.868 --> 05:36.003
I never saw him before.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.510
[loud rock music]
(Fin)
Jake Lumet.

05:42.543 --> 05:46.113
*

05:46.146 --> 05:49.149
(Munch)
Jeez, what a tip.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.119
(Fin)
Looks like somebody's been
having themselves a good time.

05:52.152 --> 05:55.456
[switches off music]

05:55.489 --> 05:57.825
He's conscious.
Call a bus.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.762
Oh, you puke on me,
I'll kill you.

06:01.795 --> 06:02.930
Okay, this guy's high.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.598
Tell the paramedics
to load up on Narcan.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.033
He's gonna need it.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.535
(Munch)
We've got a drug overdose.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.603
What have we here?

06:09.637 --> 06:10.838
Oxycodone.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.441
Paid for by Medicare.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.142
Then Jake's robbing old people
and beating up junkies.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.877
Who'd he steal the meds from?

06:16.910 --> 06:19.847
Prescribed for
a Jenny Rogers.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.082
[knock on door]

06:22.115 --> 06:23.183
Jennifer Rogers
live here?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.718
Um...Jenny just
went to the store.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.687
Why?
We'd like to talk to her.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.589
Well, I'm Carol.
I'm her daughter-in-law.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.923
She's not in any trouble,
is she?

06:29.957 --> 06:32.125
Should she be?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.895
Well, she's getting sort of
forgetful and wanders off.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.531
She takin' any
pain medications?

06:37.565 --> 06:40.133
Mm-hmm, yeah.
She's got terrible sciatica.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.702
She mention losing her meds?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.870
Maybe somebody stealing 'em?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.805
You mean like a mugging?

06:44.838 --> 06:45.873
Oh, God, yeah.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.508
Two days ago,

06:47.541 --> 06:49.610
she came home with
an awful bruise on her face.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.679
And she insisted
it was nothing, but, um--

06:51.712 --> 06:52.846
but she'd slipped,
you know?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.114
Where can we find her?

06:54.147 --> 06:56.049
You know what,
I'm gonna come with you, okay?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.117
She should
be home by now.

07:00.821 --> 07:01.622
Thank you.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.059
Jenny.
Oh, hello, Carol.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.728
Hey.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.797
Um, these are police officers
and they wanna talk to you.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.164
Hi, Jenny. I'm Olivia.
And this is Elliot.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.735
Whatcha drinking?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.003
Tea.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.738
Oh, Jenny, how could you?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.140
I'm sorry.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.108
[sighs]
It's okay, sweetheart.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.776
She just started doing this.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.211
She knows we're hard up,
and she's trying to help out.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.514
By letting her
beg on the street?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.981
Well, we asked her to stop,

07:28.015 --> 07:29.683
but we can't keep her shut up
in the apartment all day.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.019
Some bruise
you got there, Jenny.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.187
Well.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.956
I fell in the street.
It's very icy.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.727
Is that when you lost these?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.862
It must have been.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.964
Did somebody
take them from you?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.636
Were you attacked?

07:48.669 --> 07:50.070
Yeah.

07:50.103 --> 07:54.074
Do you know by who?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.276
I wanna show you some photos.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.845
See if you can
pick out the person.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.716
Take a look.
See if you can pick him out.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.918
(Carol)
Well, go on.
The police'll protect you.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.555
Maybe him.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.189
Maybe?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.563
(Fin)
Good morning, Jake.
Wakey wakey.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.267
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.669
Hey, what'd I--what'd I do?

08:21.702 --> 08:23.003
Same old, same old.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.172
Sodomized a woman,
stole her car,

08:25.205 --> 08:26.707
and almost killed her baby.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.841
[coughing]
Hey.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.042
Look, man,
I'm sick here, okay?

08:29.076 --> 08:30.143
I need a doctor.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.212
And a lawyer.
You're under arrest.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.313
Samantha Beavan gave you up.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.048
Who?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.149
(Munch)
The woman you forced
to have sex.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.250
Hey, look, man,

08:37.284 --> 08:38.919
I don't have to
force any woman.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.020
Jake, we know
you attacked Sam.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.155
We have you
on a security camera.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.125
Yeah?
Yeah, well, show me a picture.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.627
(Fin)
Just give up your partner

08:46.660 --> 08:48.562
and we'll put in
a good word for you.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.164
Yeah.
Look, I don't got no partner.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.000
[laughs]
You guys ain't got jack, man!

08:53.033 --> 08:54.768
Stop busting our balls.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.770
We got Sam and we even got
the old lady you assaulted.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.639
Eyewitness says
that you hit her

08:58.672 --> 08:59.907
and took her painkillers.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.175
What painkillers?

09:02.209 --> 09:03.911
The ones you stuffed
up your nose

09:03.944 --> 09:05.913
and left scattered
all over your crib.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.016
Oh...
[laughs]

09:09.049 --> 09:10.183
You mean Jenny's?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.656
She sold them to me.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.725
[chuckles]
Yeah.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.192
That Jake's a liar.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.061
If she sold him drugs,

09:21.094 --> 09:23.096
why'd she pick out his photo?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.998
Will her I.D.
of Jake stand up?

09:25.032 --> 09:27.300
Well, she's...a bit senile.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.836
We found her panhandling
on the street.

09:28.869 --> 09:29.870
Well, she's broke.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.171
She could be dealing.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.773
There's been cases
of Medicare patients

09:32.806 --> 09:34.241
selling their
prescription drugs.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.176
Buy for $10,
sell for $250.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.678
Get George W. on the phone,

09:37.711 --> 09:39.212
that's one way
to fix Social Security.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.181
I just talked to ACS.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.750
Sam Beavan's kid
spiked a fever,

09:42.783 --> 09:43.884
back in the hospital.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.985
Is it serious?
He's in ICU.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.054
May have pneumonia.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.789
Is this caused
by his mom's drug use?

09:48.822 --> 09:49.857
The oxycodone
made him lethargic.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.325
He aspirated milk
into his lungs.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.329
Look...Sam's a nursing mother

09:56.363 --> 10:00.367
trying to take care of
her nine-month-old kid.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.103
And Jenny Rogers
is just a sweet old lady.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.204
So why does this
pathetic junkie

10:04.237 --> 10:06.807
need to beat up
helpless women?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.108
Maybe he gets off on it,

10:08.141 --> 10:09.643
or he's trying to
intimidate 'em.

10:09.677 --> 10:10.744
(Munch)
Check the security tape.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.879
Jake's partner's the one

10:11.912 --> 10:13.146
that's dishing out
most of the punishment.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.247
(Benson)
Well, the problem is,

10:14.281 --> 10:16.717
Sam says she doesn't know him,
and Jake won't name him.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.051
(Cragen)
All right,
have Novak charge Jake

10:18.085 --> 10:19.787
with sodomy, grand larceny,

10:19.820 --> 10:21.789
kidnap, and attempted murder.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.224
When he's looking at 20 years,
he'll cough up a name.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.127
Yeah. Someone just coughed up
Sam Beavan's car.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.329
Dumped it in Queens.
CSU's bringin' it in now.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.967
(Stabler)
What do you got?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.435
Car's wiped clean.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.403
We'll run hair and fibers,
but that'll take time.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.304
(Benson)
You could've told us that

10:37.337 --> 10:39.372
before we schlepped
all the way down here.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.841
(O'Halloran)
It's not all bad news.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.111
Found these in the back
under the passenger seat.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.813
One's still got some in it.
Painkillers.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.181
He wipes the car,
but leaves these behind?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.683
That's some kind of stupid.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.251
Well, one of them
had to climb in the back

10:51.284 --> 10:52.185
to toss out the baby seat.

10:52.219 --> 10:55.388
Pills must have slipped
out of their pocket.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.890
These are two prescriptions
for oxycodone

10:56.924 --> 11:00.360
made out to Jenny Rogers.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.230
Old lady's scammin' us?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.932
Remember that routine
with the cup?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.199
"What are you drinking?"
"Uh, tea."

11:06.233 --> 11:08.035
Panhandling's
a pretty good cover

11:08.068 --> 11:09.336
if you're dealing
on the street.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.938
We should bring
the whole family in.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.873
Got a call from a friend
at the 1-5.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.107
Yeah, and?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.876
It's your daughter, Kathleen.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.378
They picked her up for DUI.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.214
They're holding her
at the precinct.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.317
Go ahead.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.798
Excuse me, Officer Crawford?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.200
Hey, how are you?

11:40.233 --> 11:41.268
Elliot Stabler.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.803
Thanks for
the heads-up to Fin.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.837
Ray Crawford.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.238
What happened?

11:45.272 --> 11:49.376
A car did
an illegal U-turn on 23rd,

11:49.409 --> 11:51.745
patrol pulled it over,
your kid's at the wheel.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.414
Cops smelled booze on her.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.817
You book her?
Yeah.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.852
She never told us
who she was.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.187
We didn't know
she was your kid

12:00.220 --> 12:03.323
until we found your
courtesy shield in her wallet.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.159
Can I see her?

12:06.193 --> 12:07.795
Yeah. This way.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.970
Daddy!

12:17.004 --> 12:18.005
It's okay, it's okay.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.874
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.076
[sighs]

12:23.110 --> 12:23.977
Why didn't you call me?

12:24.011 --> 12:25.779
Why didn't you tell
the officers who I am?

12:25.813 --> 12:28.215
I was scared.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.950
All right.
I'm sure you were, baby.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.019
No.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.055
I was scared what you'd do.

12:38.058 --> 12:41.194
Oh.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.334
Mom.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.070
Is everything okay?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.172
Yeah, I'll handle it.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.941
I'm sorry.
She went to a party--

12:53.974 --> 12:55.208
And you just let her go.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.479
Elliot. She is 17 years old.

12:59.512 --> 13:03.884
I know. Look, we'll...

13:03.917 --> 13:06.954
Take her home.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.923
Dad.
Night, baby.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.062
Oh, my--

13:20.333 --> 13:22.903
Don't ask.

13:22.936 --> 13:23.904
Get anything?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.338
I waited for you.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.540
Jenny's son?
His name is Kevin.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.311
He works as a security guard.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.346
Carol, Jenny, hi.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.582
Kevin, I'm Elliot.
Thanks for coming down.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.084
Like we had a choice.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.185
Dragging my mother out
in the middle of the night.

13:38.218 --> 13:38.952
You'd think this was
a police state.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.921
Kevin, please.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.089
(Stabler)
Kevin, relax.
No one's forcing you to stay.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.190
We'd just like to know
what a guy

13:43.223 --> 13:44.491
that we pulled in for rape

13:44.524 --> 13:46.393
was doing with your mom's
prescriptions.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.461
The guy that attacked her
was a rapist?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.198
Mom.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.632
Did he do anything to you?
No.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.434
He just pushed me.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.570
Well, thank God he only
stole your pills.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.472
He said your mom
sold him the drugs.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.308
What?

14:01.341 --> 14:02.976
You're gonna believe a rapist?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.378
I know Mom's getting on,

14:05.412 --> 14:07.147
and she loses stuff
all the time,

14:07.180 --> 14:08.916
but you've got
some nerve accusing her.

14:08.949 --> 14:09.983
(Benson)
Kevin, why don't
you and Carol

14:10.017 --> 14:11.184
grab a cup of coffee

14:11.218 --> 14:12.119
and let us
talk to your mom alone.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.087
So you can make her
say what you wanna hear?

14:14.121 --> 14:15.088
Like maybe the truth?

14:15.122 --> 14:16.256
Are you calling us liars?

14:16.289 --> 14:17.324
(Benson)
No, we're just wondering

14:17.357 --> 14:20.894
why your mom went to two doctors
in the last ten days

14:20.928 --> 14:22.429
for the same painkillers.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.897
And how your mother's pills

14:23.931 --> 14:25.665
ended up with
two different drug dealers.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.934
Okay.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.501
Let's go. Come on.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.037
(Jenny)
No. Stop it.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.105
Mom.
Kevin, stop it!

14:32.139 --> 14:34.607
I'll answer your questions.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.644
You know,
selling your pain meds...

14:37.677 --> 14:39.246
is a very serious crime.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.313
I didn't.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.215
Jake Lumet says that you did.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.383
Who the hell is Jake Lumet?

14:43.416 --> 14:45.585
Jenny,
you picked his photo out.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.087
Did he attack you or not?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.422
No, I made a mistake.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.557
Did another man
attack you?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.425
Two men?

14:52.459 --> 14:55.328
I don't remember.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.298
Do you remember going to
two different doctors?

14:58.331 --> 14:59.632
I have very bad arthritis.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.069
Carol said that
you had sciatica.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.636
She has that too.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.605
Sometimes I lose my pills,

15:05.638 --> 15:07.274
and I wanna be sure
I have enough.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.141
Did you really
lose your pills,

15:08.175 --> 15:09.542
Jenny, or did you sell them

15:09.576 --> 15:12.245
'cause you needed the money?

15:12.279 --> 15:17.084
[crying]

15:17.117 --> 15:18.385
Okay, so who do we believe?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.620
The junkie rapist
or the crying granny?

15:20.653 --> 15:23.290
She's either selling,
or she's in real bad shape.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.425
80 migs every six hours?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.194
That's enough to numb a moose.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.529
Could the doctors
be in on it?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.731
The pills Jenny had would fetch
about five grand on the street.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.333
A doc in Kentucky

15:33.366 --> 15:35.235
made a million bucks
off illegal scrips

15:35.268 --> 15:36.536
before he got caught.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.438
Unless Jenny was running
the scam on her own.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.041
I mean, a sweet old lady
like her asks for pain meds,

15:41.074 --> 15:43.710
who's gonna think
she's a junkie?

15:43.743 --> 15:46.113
What about her loving family,
Kevin and Carol?

15:46.146 --> 15:46.980
Checked their records.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.515
Both of them clean.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.617
All right, Elliot and Olivia
can talk to Jenny's doctors,

15:50.650 --> 15:53.120
find out how bad
she was hurting.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.687
Wait a minute.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.156
The only thing that connects

15:56.189 --> 15:58.158
our two victims is Jake.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.093
He bought pills from Jenny,
sold 'em to Sam.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.695
But we still don't know anything
about his partner,

16:02.729 --> 16:04.364
except everybody's too scared
to give up his name.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.498
(Cragen)
All right, you and Munch

16:05.532 --> 16:07.367
light a fire under TARU.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.336
They gotta help us
find this creep.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.109
(Morales)
Been playing with your
security camera footage.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.211
Took me a while
to find anything useful,

16:18.245 --> 16:19.479
but if you look here,

16:19.512 --> 16:21.648
I isolate
and enlarge the image,

16:21.681 --> 16:22.782
increase contrast,

16:22.815 --> 16:25.218
and for six frames,
we've got...

16:29.289 --> 16:30.257
Jake the flake.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.359
What about the other perp?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.427
Uh, no shot of the face.
But look at this.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.036
(Fin)
Check out the manicure.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.404
Our perp's a woman.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.108
Oh, my God.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.611
Why do I have to see this?

16:51.644 --> 16:53.513
I should be at the hospital.
Joey's real sick.

16:53.546 --> 16:58.285
Just tell us who she is, Sam.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.153
I don't know.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.089
(Benson)
Sam.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.790
Did you think that
we wouldn't believe you

17:03.823 --> 17:06.226
if you told us that you were
attacked by a woman?

17:06.259 --> 17:07.727
We know that women can be

17:07.760 --> 17:09.462
more vicious than men
when it comes to sexual assault.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.330
(Fin)
With men, it's business,

17:10.363 --> 17:13.100
take what they want--
money, drugs, sex.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.836
With a woman, it's personal.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.138
Especially if their victim is

17:18.171 --> 17:20.473
younger and prettier
than they are.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.674
Now, you gave us Jake.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.378
Why not this woman?

17:25.412 --> 17:29.182
I'm afraid.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.483
You don't know
what she's like.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.518
She'll kill me.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.086
Like she nearly
killed your baby.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.354
Look, Jake was driving.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.557
She threw Joey
out of the car.

17:37.590 --> 17:41.060
She would have killed him
without a second thought.

17:45.532 --> 17:49.402
What is her name, Sam?

18:02.649 --> 18:07.554
Carol.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.290
[knock on door]

18:10.323 --> 18:12.859
Carol Rogers. Police.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.870
(Benson)
I'll check the other rooms.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.472
Dead.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.440
Looks like she bled out
from a knife wound.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.210
Elliot.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.546
All this stuff is Jenny's.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.748
(Stabler)
She lives in a closet?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.188
What's going on?

18:46.259 --> 18:47.294
Oh, my God, Carol.
Don't touch her.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.162
Don't--don't touch her.
Let me go!

18:49.196 --> 18:51.398
Kevin, please.
Let go of me!

18:51.431 --> 18:52.732
Who did this?
I don't know.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.733
But you'll contaminate
the crime scene.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.835
Sit down.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.671
[sobbing]

18:58.705 --> 19:01.741
We got footprints.

19:03.843 --> 19:07.414
They don't lead anywhere.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.715
Killer must have
wiped them clean.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.451
Those are small shoes.
Woman's?

19:11.484 --> 19:14.254
Kevin.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.822
Where's your mother?

19:15.855 --> 19:18.391
She should be here.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.293
Is there any way
that these are hers?

19:24.464 --> 19:26.499
Oh, no.
[groans]

19:26.533 --> 19:29.769
Mom. No.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.876
Checked airports,
bus, train terminals,

19:36.909 --> 19:38.345
no sign of Jenny.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.847
How can a little old lady
just disappear?

19:40.880 --> 19:41.881
What about Kevin's alibi?

19:41.914 --> 19:43.516
He was at work.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.752
He's a security guard
at a furniture warehouse.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.254
(Stabler)
How far from his apartment?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.721
Couple of miles
just over the East River.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.957
Security officers
make rounds alone.

19:50.990 --> 19:51.991
Maybe he slipped out,

19:52.024 --> 19:53.760
stabbed his wife,
slipped back in.

19:53.793 --> 19:54.861
See if it's possible.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.463
But what's his motive?

19:56.496 --> 19:57.730
Carol's making money
selling drugs.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.998
We checked with the bank.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.333
The account
was in her maiden name

20:00.367 --> 20:01.634
with more than
20 grand in it.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.303
And Kevin didn't realize?

20:03.336 --> 20:05.405
(Stabler)
He's no genius,
but if he did find out

20:05.438 --> 20:07.574
that Carol was squirreling away
some cash for a rainy day

20:07.607 --> 20:08.908
and wasn't gonna
share it with him,

20:08.941 --> 20:10.510
there's your motive
right there.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.379
All right, now, one of
Carol's fingernails broke off.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.881
(Fin)
Yeah, CSU's still
looking for it.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.783
She might have
got a piece of her killer.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.850
The knife has
a textured handle.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.386
No prints.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.920
(Cragen)
Well, and what about
the footprints?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.323
CSU says it's a woman's shoe,
size seven.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.791
Okay, so we're
looking at Jenny

20:24.824 --> 20:26.359
or one of Carol's
junkie clients.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.760
Or Sam Beavan.

20:27.794 --> 20:28.761
Who's been staying
at the hospital

20:28.795 --> 20:30.497
since her kid is in the ICU.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.331
(Stabler)
I just find it
very hard to believe

20:31.364 --> 20:33.700
that a little old lady
has the strength

20:33.733 --> 20:36.336
to stab to death
a streetwise 30-year-old.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.372
Only takes one good blow
to the right spot.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.341
Thanks.

20:41.374 --> 20:44.611
Well, Carol wasn't
the only death yesterday.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.846
Sam's baby died.

20:46.879 --> 20:52.319
She left the hospital
right after it happened.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.387
Could she have gotten
to Carol's before you two?

20:54.421 --> 20:57.690
The hospital's a lot closer
to Carol's than we are.

20:57.724 --> 20:58.925
Find Sam.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.896
(Benson)
Sam?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.034
Police.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.607
Sam?

21:14.641 --> 21:15.808
Sam, are you okay?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.744
Go away.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.081
She's high.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.016
SVU portable, I need a bus
at 415 West 98th...

21:24.050 --> 21:25.752
Sam. Sam.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.019
I need you to tell me
what happened.

21:27.053 --> 21:30.423
My baby. I killed my baby.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.892
Sam, where did you go

21:32.925 --> 21:35.928
after you left the hospital?

21:39.532 --> 21:40.800
I don't remember.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.469
Who gave you the drugs?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.671
Did you get 'em from Carol?

21:44.704 --> 21:47.374
No.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.008
I hate her.
Sam.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.111
Sam, look at me. Look at me.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.380
Carol's dead.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.915
Did you kill her?

21:59.586 --> 22:02.855
She got me hooked.

22:02.889 --> 22:07.494
I'm glad she's dead.

22:07.527 --> 22:11.398
[cell phone ringing]

22:14.501 --> 22:16.869
Benson.

22:16.903 --> 22:21.674
I can take them now.

22:21.708 --> 22:26.779
They can't hurt Joey anymore.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.148
(Benson)
Yeah.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.450
You dump the calls?

22:30.483 --> 22:32.585
Okay, thanks.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.953
That was the crime lab.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.688
CSU found bloody fingerprints

22:35.722 --> 22:37.657
on a pay phone
outside of Carol's apartment.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.593
The only call that was made
around the time of the murder

22:40.627 --> 22:42.495
was to a storage house
in Queens.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.930
Crazy broad calls last night,

22:43.963 --> 22:45.498
asks what time we close.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.000
Makes me wait 40 minutes
because she lost her key,

22:48.034 --> 22:49.436
and then forgets to

22:49.469 --> 22:50.570
return the, uh, spare.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.638
Her name Jenny Rogers?

22:51.671 --> 22:56.042
Yeah, this is her unit.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.045
Crazy bitch shut it
from the inside.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.147
Jenny.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.582
Jenny, are you in there?

23:02.615 --> 23:06.619
(locker guy)
Hey, you can't do that.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.788
(Benson)
Jenny. What are you doing?

23:08.821 --> 23:10.890
I've come home.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.892
Sweetheart.
You can't stay in here.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.093
(Jenny)
Yes, I can.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.595
The gas station
across the road

23:15.628 --> 23:17.697
has a bathroom,
it's quite clean.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.165
My mother made this.

23:19.198 --> 23:22.435
She said it would
keep me warm one day.

23:25.672 --> 23:26.973
Are these your parents?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.576
(Jenny)
Yeah. That's me in the middle.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.882
And all this stuff was theirs?

23:35.915 --> 23:38.050
Yeah, I stored it here
when I sold the house.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.020
I think I need to do
some rearranging.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.490
Jenny. What's wrong
with your apartment?

23:43.523 --> 23:47.694
Carol is what's wrong with it.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.796
That's why you've come,
isn't it?

23:49.829 --> 23:52.098
Did you kill her, Jenny?

23:55.502 --> 23:58.671
Perhaps...
I should get a lawyer.

23:58.705 --> 24:02.108
Yeah. Perhaps you should.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.977
(Chandler)
This is a tragedy.

24:05.011 --> 24:05.978
(Cragen)
It's a homicide.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.113
No, it was self-defense.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.214
Now, how do you figure?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.650
Carol was unarmed,
Jenny stabbed her.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.752
She finally cracked
after suffering years

24:12.785 --> 24:14.220
of financial, emotional,
and physical abuse.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.822
Now, how can you go

24:15.855 --> 24:19.191
with an elder abuse defense
if Jenny never reported it?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.628
Because she's one of
a million and a half victims

24:21.661 --> 24:22.529
who never do.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.263
You don't believe me,
tell your detectives

24:24.296 --> 24:26.465
to ask Jenny why she
had to sell her parents' house.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.970
(Jenny)
I needed the money for Kevin.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.506
He--he had some bad luck.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.543
He--he had a business venture
go wrong.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.010
They often do
in Atlantic City.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.179
Gambling debts.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.981
(Jenny)
Then he had
an accident at work.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.282
(Chandler)
After a liquid lunch.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.818
His back was never the same.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.087
No, he needed painkillers.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.757
And then Carol got him
hooked on the other stuff,

24:50.790 --> 24:52.224
marijuana and cocaine.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.861
That's where the money went.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.095
But Carol had lots of cash.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.898
Because she was dealing drugs.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.232
Kevin never had any money.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.701
He had to ask her.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.736
Jenny, did Kevin or Carol
ever hurt you?

25:03.770 --> 25:06.739
Carol was cruel.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.941
She would stroke my arm

25:08.975 --> 25:11.010
like she was being all loving,

25:11.043 --> 25:14.246
then she would
grip it and twist.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.215
How about Kevin?
Did he ever hit you?

25:16.248 --> 25:19.318
He didn't mean to hurt me.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.087
What happened the night
that Carol died?

25:21.120 --> 25:23.189
(Chandler)
You don't have to answer,
Jenny.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.657
Yeah, she's right about that.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.159
But with this evidence,
a jury will convict

25:27.193 --> 25:29.696
without you ever
saying a word.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.732
(Benson)
But, if Carol
made your life hell,

25:32.765 --> 25:35.234
then the jury's also gonna
take that into consideration.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.805
Jenny, you need to tell us
your side of the story.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.275
[door opens]

25:43.309 --> 25:44.811
(Cragen)
Detectives.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.684
CSU found Carol's
missing fingernail.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.686
Warner faxed over this report.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.755
What's going on?

25:55.788 --> 25:58.625
There were
blood and skin fragments

25:58.658 --> 26:00.192
under one of
Carol's fingernails.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.863
She got a piece of
her murderer.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.898
Jenny, DNA says
the blood's from a man.

26:05.932 --> 26:09.068
(Stabler)
Now, you know
who that is, don't you?

26:15.875 --> 26:18.210
[sighs]

26:18.244 --> 26:19.979
I came home from the store,

26:20.012 --> 26:22.949
but I never went back
into the apartment.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.785
(Benson)
Why not?

26:25.818 --> 26:28.788
I heard people arguing,
real angry.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.658
Then a scream,

26:31.691 --> 26:34.894
and the door opened
and I hid.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.964
And a man
ran down the stairs.

26:37.997 --> 26:42.068
Kevin.
Yes.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.104
[sobs]

26:45.137 --> 26:46.806
I went in and I saw Carol.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.107
I pulled the knife out of her,

26:48.140 --> 26:49.876
but I couldn't
stop the bleeding.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.211
[door opening]

26:52.244 --> 26:54.947
I heard you found my mother.
Why didn't you call me?

26:54.981 --> 26:56.716
We wanted to
talk to her first.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.785
What the hell is she
doing in there?

26:58.818 --> 27:00.219
Telling us
how you murdered Carol.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.921
What?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.022
Why would I kill my wife?

27:03.055 --> 27:04.056
'Cause she robbed you blind.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.895
Don't listen to them, Mom.
Don't say anything!

27:08.928 --> 27:10.429
All right, all right,
that's enough, come on.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.864
Get off of me!

27:11.898 --> 27:13.032
I didn't do anything!

27:13.065 --> 27:14.366
(Cragen)
Scratch says you did.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.703
(Fin)
Kevin Rogers,
you're under arrest

27:16.736 --> 27:18.070
for the murder
of Carol Rogers.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.806
You have the right
to remain silent.

27:19.839 --> 27:23.175
Mom...what have you done?

27:23.209 --> 27:25.111
Anything you do say
can be used against you

27:25.144 --> 27:26.445
in a court of law.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.280
You have a right
to an attorney.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.116
If you cannot afford one...

27:51.971 --> 27:53.072
You okay?

27:57.476 --> 27:59.011
Tough one.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.014
Especially for the mom.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.956
What happened at the 1-5
two nights ago?

28:16.763 --> 28:18.230
My kid got in trouble.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.804
Good night.

28:24.837 --> 28:25.972
Why didn't you tell me?

28:29.275 --> 28:31.177
Nothing to tell.
I took care of it.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.112
Patrol issued a summons
for a moving violation,

28:33.145 --> 28:35.147
they brought Kathleen
down to verify I.D.

28:35.181 --> 28:38.084
After you got everybody
to make her DUI go away.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.827
Okay...

28:47.860 --> 28:48.895
what are you saying,
Captain?

28:48.928 --> 28:50.863
Somebody starts digging,

28:50.897 --> 28:52.164
they're gonna find
the paper trail.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.100
Radio tapes
from the sector car

28:54.133 --> 28:55.802
telling Dispatch
they stopped a DUI.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.404
If it comes back to me,
I'll take care of it.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.072
What about the guys who
stuck their necks out for you?

29:03.275 --> 29:04.944
Well, they've got kids.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.413
They understand.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.416
That the message
you wanna send your kids?

29:10.449 --> 29:12.384
That the law only applies
to certain people?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.122
I'm taking care of my family.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.324
And given the chance,
I'd do it again.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.099
Am I interrupting something?

29:30.369 --> 29:33.372
No.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.010
Arraignment go okay?

29:38.044 --> 29:39.812
Yeah.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.347
Kevin was denied bail.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.884
I'm gonna need your reports
as soon as possible.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.519
Detective Stabler
will type up his DD5s now.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.429
(Novak)
On the day of the murder,

29:57.463 --> 30:00.833
what happened when you
went back to the apartment?

30:00.867 --> 30:02.601
(Jenny)
I heard people arguing inside.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.837
I didn't want to go in,

30:04.871 --> 30:07.006
so I hid on the stairs.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.841
Then I heard a scream.

30:08.875 --> 30:09.909
What happened next?

30:13.045 --> 30:14.947
Someone
ran down the stairs.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.349
Who was that man, Jenny?

30:17.383 --> 30:18.417
Objection.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.485
Leading the witness.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.087
She just testified
that she heard

30:21.120 --> 30:23.222
an argument between
a man and a woman.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.556
As the woman in question

30:24.590 --> 30:26.926
now has a knife
sticking out of her chest,

30:26.959 --> 30:28.194
"someone" has to be a man.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.161
(Delroy)
Or a woman
who sounds like a man.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.229
(Petrovsky)
All right, Mr. Delroy.

30:30.262 --> 30:33.866
Miss Novak?

30:33.900 --> 30:36.835
(Novak)
Who did you see running
down the steps, Jenny?

30:38.637 --> 30:42.108
I was hiding.

30:42.141 --> 30:46.112
[sighs]
And I...didn't see him.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.085
You didn't see him?

30:54.520 --> 30:56.355
No.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.857
I was too scared to look.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.129
Let me remind you
of your grand jury testimony.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.532
Read that.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.435
Read it, the part

31:09.468 --> 31:11.670
where you say
you saw your son, Kevin,

31:11.703 --> 31:14.941
running down the stairs.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.576
I never saw him.

31:19.711 --> 31:23.382
You lied...
to the grand jury?

31:23.415 --> 31:26.052
(Jenny)
I was angry at Kevin for
marrying that awful woman.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.120
I wanted to punish him.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.959
You realize
you're committing perjury.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.028
You could go to prison.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.967
Did you see Kevin
run down the stairs?

31:44.036 --> 31:46.205
I didn't.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.142
I'm nearly 70.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.610
I get confused.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.480
I'm very sorry.

31:56.648 --> 32:00.519
I'm sure you are.

32:00.552 --> 32:01.720
Nothing further.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.489
(Delroy)
Move for dismissal,
Your Honor.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.391
Only the testimony of
Mrs. Rogers can put my client

32:05.424 --> 32:06.692
anywhere near
the scene of the crime.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.028
Without it, the People
don't come close

32:09.061 --> 32:11.363
to making
a prima facie case.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.698
Any more witnesses,
Miss Novak?

32:12.731 --> 32:15.534
No, Your Honor.

32:15.567 --> 32:18.737
Then I have no choice but to
grant the defense's request.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.106
The case is dismissed.

32:20.139 --> 32:23.109
Mr. Rogers,
you're free to go.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.045
Mrs. Rogers,
you may step down.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.359
Let's go.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.267
I don't know what to say.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.335
I-I really thought Jenny

32:49.368 --> 32:51.370
was strong enough to testify.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.205
That was Rikers.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.440
Maybe she would have been

32:54.473 --> 32:55.774
if she hadn't
visited her son last night.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.477
How the hell
did you let that happen?

32:58.510 --> 33:00.479
I can't stop a mother
from visiting her son.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.214
Looks like
we can't stop a son

33:02.248 --> 33:03.182
from beating up
his mother, either.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.452
(Cragen)
You gonna charge Jenny
with perjury?

33:06.485 --> 33:07.719
Well, what's the point
of sending her to jail?

33:07.753 --> 33:09.188
She's still the victim.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.356
Well then, there's
nothing more we can do.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.390
She's made her bed.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.226
Yeah, on a mattress
in a closet.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.761
You know,
if we don't do something,

33:15.794 --> 33:17.496
Kevin's gonna keep right on
abusing her.

33:17.529 --> 33:18.664
(Cragen)
It's over.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.566
We're not social workers.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.171
[knock on door]

33:25.204 --> 33:26.572
[door unlatching]

33:26.605 --> 33:27.606
Yeah, what is it?

33:27.639 --> 33:28.640
Deirdre Bathhurst

33:28.674 --> 33:30.042
from Adult
Protective Services.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.343
I'm here to see Jenny Rogers.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.212
May I come in?

33:33.245 --> 33:35.247
She's inside.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.217
You can't come in.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.251
You're trespassing.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.087
Get out.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.754
Miss Bathhurst is legally
entitled to a police escort.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.256
Hi, Jenny, how are you?

33:44.290 --> 33:46.192
(Kevin)
What for?
I got no beef with you.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.227
She's entering
a dangerous home.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.295
Haven't you heard?

33:49.328 --> 33:51.530
The guy who lives here
is a murderer.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.133
I didn't murder anybody.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.302
You should be looking for
the guy who killed my wife,

33:56.335 --> 34:00.572
not bothering
innocent people.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.741
But what are you doing?

34:02.774 --> 34:03.842
(Bathhurst)
Checking to make sure
Mrs. Rogers has adequate food.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.111
I haven't done
the shopping yet.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.145
You need to do that, sir.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.045
I got her lunch.

34:07.079 --> 34:08.714
(Stabler)
What, french fries?

34:08.747 --> 34:10.349
Next thing you know

34:10.382 --> 34:12.551
you'll be telling me
that ketchup's a vegetable, huh?

34:12.584 --> 34:13.819
Hey, Jenny,
how you doing?

34:13.852 --> 34:14.653
(Jenny)
Oh, I'm fine.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.688
Please, leave us alone.

34:16.722 --> 34:17.489
Okay.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.625
(Kevin)
You heard her, she's my mom.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.393
I love her,
and I'm gonna take care of her.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.195
I've even given her
my room to sleep in.

34:23.229 --> 34:26.532
What are your stinky sweats
doing tucked under the pillow?

34:26.565 --> 34:28.367
This is police harassment.
Get out.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.705
Jenny, this is my card.

34:33.739 --> 34:34.806
You call me anytime, okay?

34:34.840 --> 34:35.874
Get out!

34:35.907 --> 34:39.678
Now!

34:39.711 --> 34:41.213
Have a nice day.

34:44.616 --> 34:45.651
I'll visit every two days.

34:45.684 --> 34:46.852
That's it?

34:46.885 --> 34:48.787
Our maximum case load
is supposed to be 30.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.289
I have nearly 50.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.191
Some of them in
a lot worse shape than Jenny.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.325
You saw the fridge,
you saw the cupboards,

34:53.359 --> 34:54.360
there's nothing in 'em.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.594
She's sleeping on the floor.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.363
Jenny was eating
and she was clean.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.764
Unless she makes a complaint

34:58.797 --> 35:01.767
or we see concrete evidence
of abuse, we can't act.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.469
I'm sorry, Detective,
but that's the law.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.572
Thanks, anyway.
Thank you.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.175
(Benson)
Hey.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.510
What's goin' on?

35:11.543 --> 35:13.179
I don't know.
What's goin' on?

35:13.212 --> 35:14.646
Cragen's pretty steamed.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.215
Kevin's lawyer claims
that you harassed him.

35:23.955 --> 35:24.856
Kevin Rogers' attorney

35:24.890 --> 35:26.458
has filed an official complaint
against you.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.493
Of course he has.

35:27.526 --> 35:28.727
Captain, look.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.795
Kevin's gonna do anything

35:29.828 --> 35:31.730
to keep his punching bag
at home.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.566
How many times do you think
you can break the rules

35:34.600 --> 35:35.667
and get away with it?

35:39.438 --> 35:41.573
You stay away from him.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.789
Thank you.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.591
It's after midnight, Jenny.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.327
Oh, what are you doing here?

36:01.360 --> 36:02.628
You were told to stay away!

36:02.661 --> 36:03.695
I'll tell my son!

36:03.729 --> 36:04.863
Fine, let's go wake him up.
Come on.

36:04.896 --> 36:07.699
No, don't. Please.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.835
Just leave.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.573
If I leave,
will you go back inside?

36:14.606 --> 36:17.509
Or are you too afraid?

36:17.543 --> 36:19.445
I-I gotta get some money.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.647
My son lost his job
because of the trial.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.782
If I don't help out,
we're gonna get evicted.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.951
Kevin is a big boy,
he can take care of himself.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.388
Look, Jenny.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.590
Let me take you
to a shelter.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.759
They'll give you
a bed for the night.

36:33.792 --> 36:34.793
Come on.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.728
No. I'm stayin' here.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.398
If you don't mind,
nobody will give me any money

36:39.431 --> 36:41.300
with you hanging around.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.305
Jenny Rogers,
you're under arrest

36:46.338 --> 36:47.406
for disorderly conduct.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.374
How am I being disorderly?

36:48.407 --> 36:50.509
Huh?
Obstructing traffic.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.344
Let's go.

36:55.947 --> 37:00.486
Don't you have a family
to go home to?

37:00.519 --> 37:02.888
How much can you make
doing this?

37:02.921 --> 37:06.458
Oh, on a good day,
$20 an hour.

37:06.492 --> 37:08.026
People feel sorry for me.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.797
(Stabler)
Mm-hmm.
He do that to you?

37:11.830 --> 37:13.765
I burnt myself on the stove.

37:13.799 --> 37:18.370
You know, I see guys like him
all the time.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.806
Usually after they've raped
or beaten up a woman.

37:20.839 --> 37:21.940
Yeah.

37:21.973 --> 37:22.974
Now, Jenny.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.543
All you gotta do

37:24.576 --> 37:26.478
is just tell me
what he did to you.

37:26.512 --> 37:28.980
That way, we can get him
the treatment that he needs.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.549
Where, in prison?

37:32.451 --> 37:33.519
He burns you, he hits you,

37:33.552 --> 37:35.454
he makes you beg out
on the street

37:35.487 --> 37:37.589
in the middle of the night.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.560
Jenny, he murdered
his own wife.

37:41.593 --> 37:45.063
Do you think
prison'll fix him?

37:45.096 --> 37:47.366
He'd be lost.
He'd really go bad.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.301
Like he's good now.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.502
No.

37:50.536 --> 37:53.038
You think I'm blind.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.674
But I know my son.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.376
I know what he did.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.411
Then give him up.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.382
Do you have children?

38:03.415 --> 38:04.783
Yes.

38:04.816 --> 38:08.320
What would you do if
one of them got into trouble?

38:08.354 --> 38:12.023
You would help them.

38:12.057 --> 38:15.927
It was my job
to bring Kevin up right,

38:15.961 --> 38:17.663
and I failed.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.332
I won't fail him again.

38:20.366 --> 38:23.402
So don't ask me to betray him

38:23.435 --> 38:26.905
because I never will.

38:36.748 --> 38:37.816
(Stabler)
What are you doing here?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.017
I called your home,
I called your cell,

38:39.050 --> 38:40.051
I called the desk.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.788
They said you signed back in.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.523
Why don't you tell me
what you're doing?

38:44.556 --> 38:47.593
I just didn't want you
to get in trouble.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.862
You haven't
done anything stupid?

38:52.998 --> 38:56.435
We just keep losing people.

38:56.468 --> 38:59.638
The baby, Sam, even Carol.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.508
I just didn't want
another victim.

39:06.745 --> 39:07.813
What is she gonna do?

39:10.416 --> 39:14.152
I'm taking her
back to her son's.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.687
Good night, Liv.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.489
Go home.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.903
You want a way out?

39:31.937 --> 39:33.439
Don't think there is one.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.006
Maybe there is.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.174
I talked to Corrections
at Rikers.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.177
They say Kevin was jonesing
real bad when he was in there.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.579
He's still using.

39:40.612 --> 39:41.880
He's gonna be
looking to score.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.749
Explains why he made Jenny
go begging at midnight.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.183
Do you know where
he'd go to buy?

39:45.216 --> 39:46.952
(Fin)
More or less.

39:46.985 --> 39:50.121
But we're gonna have to
get more creative than that.

39:50.155 --> 39:53.124
[tires screeching]

39:53.158 --> 39:54.860
What'd I do now, man?

39:54.893 --> 39:55.894
Get in the car.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.930
Aw!

39:58.964 --> 40:00.866
I swear to you, man,
I'm clean, all right?

40:00.899 --> 40:02.167
I changed my ways--
Shut up!

40:02.200 --> 40:05.036
Okay.
We need a favor.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.204
This guy's looking to buy.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.873
We want you to sell to him.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.140
What's wrong with
his own dealer?

40:09.174 --> 40:10.676
He's on vacation.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.844
Look man, I told you.
I changed my ways, all right?

40:12.878 --> 40:14.045
Wait, wait--

40:14.079 --> 40:15.514
Change back.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.616
I want you to sell him this
for half a G.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.117
(Naldo)
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about my overhead, man?

40:19.150 --> 40:20.986
That's the favor, Naldo.

40:21.019 --> 40:24.422
You don't,
I'm busting you.

40:27.626 --> 40:28.694
All right,

40:28.727 --> 40:30.562
We'll take you there.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.236

40:38.269 --> 40:40.105
(Fin)
Come back tomorrow.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.508

40:51.282 --> 40:54.586
Okay, come on,
Naldo, move in.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.060
He's not buyin'.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.128
Just wait.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.104
Okay, Naldo, get clear.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.512
Go.
Choke on it.

41:20.546 --> 41:21.613
He's all yours.

41:21.647 --> 41:22.914
(officer on radio)
10-4.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.550
The product's
in his right hand.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.918
Freeze. Police.
Hands in the air!

41:26.952 --> 41:28.520
Come on.

41:28.554 --> 41:29.555
What's up, man?
I'm just out for a walk.

41:29.588 --> 41:30.689
Spread 'em.

41:30.722 --> 41:31.857
Come on.

41:31.890 --> 41:33.091
(Kevin)
I haven't got anything.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.093
What's this, then?

41:35.126 --> 41:36.895
That's three and a half grams
possession

41:36.928 --> 41:38.196
with intent to distribute.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.999
That's a class C felony.
Three to six years.

41:41.032 --> 41:42.133
They'll deal that down

41:42.167 --> 41:45.003
to a one-year mandated
treatment upstate.

41:45.036 --> 41:48.073
That good enough?

41:48.106 --> 41:51.910
Good enough.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.199

42:20.205 --> 42:21.807

It's a program.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.575
Kevin has a chance
to get better

42:23.609 --> 42:25.310
and you can live your life
without being afraid.

42:25.343 --> 42:28.914
What life?

42:28.947 --> 42:31.016
You took my son away?

42:31.049 --> 42:34.252
What have I got
to live for now?
