WEBVTT

00:05.906 --> 00:08.070
Previously, on Deadbeat.

00:08.071 --> 00:11.320
- All right, try it now.
- Testes, one, two, three.

00:11.321 --> 00:13.389
- Good.
- That sounded good.

00:13.390 --> 00:14.916
Ah! Oh!

00:14.917 --> 00:16.963
Are you seeing any ghosts right now?

00:16.964 --> 00:18.472
No.

00:18.473 --> 00:20.889
Steve Myer is the mayor of New York.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.572
I asked him, I said, "yo,
what's taking so freaking long

00:23.573 --> 00:25.417
with the Second Ave. Subway line?"

00:25.418 --> 00:27.262
He says the workers don't want to work

00:27.263 --> 00:29.611
because it might be haunted.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.523
We elected a Mayor Myer?

00:39.710 --> 00:42.728
- Shaky legs. Knock it off.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:42.729 --> 00:44.407
I'm just nervous about the $10,000, Roofie.

00:44.408 --> 00:45.614
It could change my life, man.

00:45.615 --> 00:47.795
Kevin Pacalioglu and Rufus Jones?

00:47.796 --> 00:49.774
Rufus?

00:49.775 --> 00:51.384
Yeah, that's my name.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.592
Mayor Myer will see you now.

00:52.593 --> 00:53.799
Very good.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.377
Hey, look, man. Be... be cool.

00:55.378 --> 00:57.121
I know how you get around authority types.

01:02.256 --> 01:03.763
Oh, gentlemen. Welcome.

01:03.764 --> 01:07.152
Good to see you again, Mr.
Mayor. Your excellency.

01:07.153 --> 01:08.428
Please be seated.

01:08.429 --> 01:10.809
As you both know, the
election is coming up.

01:10.810 --> 01:12.185
And I intend to win.

01:12.186 --> 01:13.795
- Ha-ha.
- You see, new yorkers,

01:13.796 --> 01:15.875
they like progress.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.721
And the premise of my proposed programs

01:17.722 --> 01:20.471
has been the production
of prolonged projects.

01:20.472 --> 01:22.216
That's literally my promise.

01:22.217 --> 01:23.759
The promise of progress.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.242
You're kind of blowing my mind right now.

01:26.243 --> 01:28.289
And the icon of this campaign

01:28.290 --> 01:30.905
has become the completion of
the Second Avenue subway line.

01:30.906 --> 01:33.858
But now, after the recent cave-in,

01:33.859 --> 01:36.709
the workers are refusing to finish the job.

01:36.710 --> 01:38.857
They are scared to go down there.

01:38.858 --> 01:40.937
Uh, and you think it's haunted?

01:40.938 --> 01:44.426
Well, some would say that
the subway tunnel is haunted.

01:44.427 --> 01:47.143
I personally would not go
on record saying as much.

01:48.654 --> 01:50.699
Yesterday you told me you needed a medium.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.417
No, no, no, no, no.

01:53.418 --> 01:55.798
That was just a casual
conversation amongst friends.

01:55.799 --> 01:57.476
And that reminds me,

01:57.477 --> 01:59.791
how is it that you two know
each other? Are you friends?

01:59.792 --> 02:01.200
Uh... yeah, yeah.

02:01.201 --> 02:02.710
Well, yes.

02:02.711 --> 02:04.857
Also, Roofie is my drug...

02:06.166 --> 02:08.547
Counselor. I'm his drug counselor.

02:08.548 --> 02:10.526
Not him. You know, he has a trouble niece.

02:10.527 --> 02:12.137
I counsel her with the...

02:12.138 --> 02:14.822
See, I love helping kids.

02:14.823 --> 02:17.136
Just like he loves helping ghosts.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.780
How does that work, exactly?

02:18.781 --> 02:19.987
Helping ghosts?

02:19.988 --> 02:22.303
Oh, well, you know, I just, uh...

02:22.304 --> 02:24.919
I sort of find the ghosts'
unfinished business

02:24.920 --> 02:26.798
and I just finish it.

02:26.799 --> 02:28.174
Kind of like what you're doing

02:28.175 --> 02:29.918
with the Second Avenue subway line.

02:29.919 --> 02:30.992
Ah.

02:33.644 --> 02:34.938
Yes.

02:34.939 --> 02:36.632
All right, all right, all right, all right!

02:36.633 --> 02:38.193
Oh!

02:38.194 --> 02:40.444
Happy, man. Congratulations on yourself.

02:40.648 --> 02:43.601
I know. Roofie, I'm gonna
exorcise the living

02:43.602 --> 02:45.461
- Out of that subway station.
- I know you are, man.

02:45.462 --> 02:47.589
- Look, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, dad.

02:47.590 --> 02:50.145
Wait, dad? Did you just call me dad?

02:50.146 --> 02:51.537
- What?
- You just called me dad.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.338
No, I wouldn't call you dad.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.291
Hey, you want to get stoned

02:56.292 --> 02:58.012
and go watch that new
Camomile White exercise DVD?

02:58.013 --> 03:00.240
- Sound like a good idea, my white son.
- All right.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074

03:35.916 --> 03:37.875
Sue, remind me, what is
this ridiculous charity

03:37.876 --> 03:39.237
that we're going to again?

03:39.238 --> 03:40.928
Oh, it's for survivors

03:40.929 --> 03:42.758
of people who claim they've
been raped by ghosts.

03:42.759 --> 03:45.085
Right. Uh, take out my speech.

03:45.086 --> 03:46.577
Oh. Um...

03:46.578 --> 03:48.636
What? What? What the hell is that?

03:48.637 --> 03:49.899
Is that a goldfish?

03:49.900 --> 03:51.699
Oh, actually, she's a carp.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.221
Her name's Barbara.

03:53.222 --> 03:55.051
She doesn't look as though
she's doing too well.

03:55.052 --> 03:57.080
I found her in a puddle. She's a rescue.

03:57.081 --> 03:59.736
A puddle? She's probably
riddled with disease.

03:59.737 --> 04:01.924
We can't look after a
riddled-with-disease goldfish.

04:01.925 --> 04:04.151
Oh, I found her. I don't
mind taking care of her.

04:04.152 --> 04:06.011
- I love fish.
- Fine, Sue. Don't you worry.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.642
I know exactly what do to.

04:08.867 --> 04:10.656
Oh, no! No!

04:10.657 --> 04:12.426
Oh, relax, relax.

04:12.427 --> 04:14.614
This leads all the way out
to the river. It's fine.

04:14.615 --> 04:15.977
Come on. Bloody come on.

04:15.978 --> 04:17.935
Come on.

04:17.937 --> 04:19.528
That's the subway.

04:19.529 --> 04:21.427
That doesn't lead to water.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.150
Come on.

04:27.863 --> 04:29.961
This is where it all goes down.

04:29.962 --> 04:31.890
Stuff moving around, electrical surges.

04:31.891 --> 04:34.675
And as you probably heard a
few days ago, the cave-in.

04:34.676 --> 04:36.565
Uh-huh. So you think it's a ghost

04:36.566 --> 04:39.429
and not just the tunnel, like, settling?

04:39.430 --> 04:40.921
No. For my money, I think the tunnel

04:40.922 --> 04:42.612
is being haunted by one of my guys.

04:42.613 --> 04:43.845
- Oh.
- Mikey O'Schmidt.

04:43.846 --> 04:45.413
He had an accident a few months back,

04:45.414 --> 04:46.981
and he didn't make it.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.748
The thing is, Mikey's a good worker.

04:48.749 --> 04:50.516
A real stand-up guy, you know.

04:50.517 --> 04:52.283
So why he would be causing
trouble, I have no idea.

04:52.284 --> 04:54.819
It beats me. Anyway,
nobody'll go past here.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.517
Yeah. Who knows?

04:56.518 --> 04:59.523
Maybe he just had a thing
for deep, dark holes.

04:59.524 --> 05:02.489
Yeah, all right. Then why
don't you get to it, okay?

05:02.490 --> 05:03.717
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, you'll find your way.

05:03.718 --> 05:05.524
- Okay.
- This place give me the creeps.

05:05.525 --> 05:07.193
Yeah.

05:14.223 --> 05:15.830
"Herro"?

05:21.363 --> 05:24.998
Hey. Uh, hey, construction worker guy.

05:26.565 --> 05:28.931
Hey, Mikey O'Schmidt?

05:28.932 --> 05:30.399
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

05:30.400 --> 05:32.296
No civilians down here.

05:32.297 --> 05:33.734
It's a liability.

05:33.735 --> 05:35.572
No, no, I'm not a civilian. I'm a medium.

05:35.573 --> 05:36.900
- I'm here to help you.
- All right, tell you what.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.507
My shift ends in an hour.

05:38.508 --> 05:39.975
Why don't you meet me
up on the street level.

05:39.976 --> 05:41.773
No, no, no. What are you talking about?

05:41.774 --> 05:43.610
There's no... there's no shift.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.478
Haven't you noticed there's
nobody else down here?

05:45.479 --> 05:46.676
You haven't heard?

05:46.677 --> 05:48.304
The other guys think this place

05:48.305 --> 05:50.211
is kind of haunted.

05:50.212 --> 05:52.807
You know, I overheard some of
them talk about the equipment

05:52.808 --> 05:54.545
turning on by itself.

05:54.546 --> 05:56.342
These rocks floating around like this.

05:57.881 --> 05:59.647
Oh. Uh-oh.

05:59.648 --> 06:02.254
You believe that or what?

06:02.255 --> 06:04.281
- Oh, my God.
- What?

06:04.282 --> 06:06.318
You're a ghost who
doesn't know he's a ghost.

06:06.319 --> 06:07.816
What did you just say to me?

06:07.817 --> 06:09.454
- I...
- How'd you get down here anyway?

06:09.455 --> 06:10.782
What are you, some kind
of hobo or something?

06:10.783 --> 06:12.619
Yo, I don't suck pa-chank.

06:12.620 --> 06:13.857
I said hobo.

06:13.858 --> 06:15.725
- Oh.
- Why don't you get out of here

06:15.726 --> 06:18.661
before I rip off your pa-chank
and stick it up your pacino.

06:18.662 --> 06:20.528
Mike, I'm gonna tell you something.

06:20.529 --> 06:21.826
You're a dead man.

06:21.827 --> 06:23.394
Now you're threatening me?

06:23.395 --> 06:26.489
- No, that came out wrong.
- Nobody,

06:26.490 --> 06:28.157
nobody threatens Mikey O'Schmidt.

06:28.158 --> 06:29.425
Now, get the hell out of here.

06:29.426 --> 06:31.893
Yeah, yeah, okay.

06:40.201 --> 06:42.766
No, stop eating the
newspapers, you little piggy.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.204
I need those.

06:44.205 --> 06:45.732
They're delicious.

06:45.733 --> 06:48.308
What is this? What are you eating?

06:48.309 --> 06:51.404
Oh, my God. This is the
obituary I've been looking for.

06:51.405 --> 06:53.711
You ate everything except for
the part I need for my case.

06:53.712 --> 06:55.808
Well, it's a good thing I stopped you.

07:01.181 --> 07:04.146
Okay. Look, Mikey.

07:04.147 --> 07:05.852
Hey, hey. No civilians down here.

07:05.853 --> 07:07.686
It's a liability.

07:07.687 --> 07:09.422
No, I'm the... I'm the guy from earlier.

07:09.423 --> 07:10.598
The medium, remember?

07:10.599 --> 07:11.775
Anyway, I just came down here

07:11.776 --> 07:13.413
to show you this newspaper clipping.

07:13.414 --> 07:14.589
You're gonna get a kick... tell you what.

07:14.590 --> 07:16.168
My shift ends in an hour.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.374
Why don't you meet me
up on the street level.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.081
What are you talking about, man?

07:19.082 --> 07:20.885
Stop dicking around. I got
something I want to show you.

07:20.886 --> 07:22.189
What is wrong with you?

07:22.190 --> 07:23.366
Do you have old-timer's disease or what?

07:23.367 --> 07:24.807
What did you say to me?

07:24.808 --> 07:26.053
How'd you get down here anyway?

07:26.054 --> 07:28.024
Are you some kind of hobo or something?

07:28.025 --> 07:30.451
Uh, excuse me.

07:35.193 --> 07:38.173
- Hey, Mikey O'Schmidt.
- Hey, hey, hey!

07:38.174 --> 07:41.017
No civilians down
here. It's a liability.

07:41.018 --> 07:43.022
Oh, boy.

07:54.942 --> 07:58.609
Barkeep, can I have another one, please?

07:58.610 --> 08:01.786
And, uh, go ahead and leave the bottle.

08:01.787 --> 08:03.590
Yeah, we don't really do that here.

08:03.591 --> 08:06.405
No, but it's in all those
movies, though, so...

08:06.406 --> 08:08.297
yeah, but it's not like a real thing.

08:08.298 --> 08:10.229
If you want another drink,
I'll pour you another drink.

08:10.230 --> 08:11.876
It's just, you know, the bottle,

08:11.877 --> 08:13.082
- there's no way to regular it.
- All right.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.117
Yeah, fair enough.

08:24.321 --> 08:25.889
Sue?

08:25.890 --> 08:27.291
Oh, my God. Hi.

08:27.292 --> 08:30.047
Are you, like, uh, sobbing?

08:30.048 --> 08:31.587
No, I'm just weeping.

08:31.588 --> 08:32.763
Oh.

08:32.764 --> 08:33.940
What about?

08:33.941 --> 08:36.861
Life. Death.

08:36.863 --> 08:38.461
Camomile.

08:38.462 --> 08:40.657
Ah, been there.

08:40.658 --> 08:43.010
Here, here, why don't
you wipe your face off.

08:43.011 --> 08:44.687
You look like a little street rat.

08:44.688 --> 08:46.227
Thanks.

08:46.228 --> 08:47.570
May I?

08:47.571 --> 08:49.698
Yeah.

08:49.699 --> 08:51.199
What's all this about?

08:51.200 --> 08:52.444
Oh, nothing.

08:52.445 --> 08:53.827
It's a case I'm working on.

08:53.828 --> 08:55.425
This ghost that doesn't know he's dead.

08:55.426 --> 08:57.494
Oh. How does that work?

08:57.495 --> 09:00.240
The way someone is in death is very similar

09:00.241 --> 09:01.485
to the way someone is in life.

09:01.486 --> 09:03.544
You know, and like this Mikey ghost,

09:03.545 --> 09:06.104
he's a macho construction
worker type of guy

09:06.105 --> 09:08.330
that never would admit that he got hurt.

09:08.331 --> 09:10.889
- So is denial carried over?
- Yeah.

09:10.890 --> 09:13.272
I... I just need to make him
understand that he's dead.

09:13.273 --> 09:14.892
But this Mikey ghost,

09:14.893 --> 09:17.076
he's on some sort of, like, ghostal loop.

09:17.077 --> 09:19.863
Every time I go to talk
to him about his death

09:19.864 --> 09:22.248
he just keeps resetting,
like he's never even met me.

09:22.249 --> 09:23.858
- Huh.
- It's... it's bizarre.

09:23.859 --> 09:25.508
I've never seen anything like it before.

09:25.509 --> 09:27.893
He... I shouldn't be boring you with this.

09:27.894 --> 09:30.983
Are you kidding? I love
talking about this ghost stuff.

09:30.984 --> 09:35.088
If I talk to Camomile about it,
she'd just berate me senseless.

09:35.089 --> 09:37.071
She's mean, isn't she?

09:37.072 --> 09:38.550
In a weird way,

09:38.551 --> 09:41.005
it's her evilness that
draws me to her most.

09:41.006 --> 09:43.521
Yes. I think I have the exact same thing.

09:43.522 --> 09:47.013
It's like a shame boner. I
get a shame boner around her.

09:47.014 --> 09:49.206
Yeah, me too. But... but not that.

09:49.207 --> 09:50.746
Yeah, the lady version of that.

09:50.747 --> 09:52.467
Yeah. What's wrong with us?

09:52.468 --> 09:54.550
There's nothing wrong with us.

09:54.551 --> 09:57.096
We're... we're normal. She's nuts.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.078
You know what? Matter of fact,

09:59.079 --> 10:00.628
Camomile.

10:00.629 --> 10:03.657
Yeah,  her.

10:03.658 --> 10:05.800
her right in the asshole.

10:06.777 --> 10:08.386
Yeah.

10:09.635 --> 10:10.882
Yeah.

10:10.883 --> 10:12.462
Oh, man.

10:12.463 --> 10:14.273
I am so glad that I ran into you here.

10:14.274 --> 10:16.185
I... I needed a distraction from this.

10:16.186 --> 10:17.503
This is making me bonkers.

10:18.742 --> 10:20.824
Wait. Maybe that's it.

10:20.825 --> 10:23.712
Maybe you don't need to break the loop.

10:23.713 --> 10:25.835
Maybe you just need to
distract him from the loop

10:25.836 --> 10:27.717
long enough to get through to him.

10:27.718 --> 10:29.397
Well, how would I do that?

10:29.398 --> 10:31.511
You said he's a New York
City construction worker.

10:31.512 --> 10:32.718
- Yeah.
- You literally

10:32.719 --> 10:33.936
just need a pretty girl.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.475
A pretty girl?

10:35.476 --> 10:36.693
Will you do it?

10:36.694 --> 10:39.401
Me? You think I'm pretty?

10:39.402 --> 10:42.474
Yeah. You're pretty enough for this guy.

10:43.792 --> 10:46.566
How would you like to
get really drunk with me?

10:46.567 --> 10:49.960
Like, the most drunk you've
ever gotten in your entire life.

10:51.934 --> 10:53.190
- It's on me.
- I would love that.

10:53.191 --> 10:54.447
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:54.448 --> 10:55.579
Yeah. Barkeep.

11:16.157 --> 11:18.216
Okay.

11:18.217 --> 11:20.324
I have to tell you something.
I have to tell you this.

11:20.325 --> 11:23.003
This is between you and me, but
this job I'm doing right now

11:23.004 --> 11:26.813
is for the mayor of New York City.

11:26.814 --> 11:29.946
And if I do it right, it will
bring me glory and riches

11:29.947 --> 11:31.754
beyond my wildest dreams.

11:31.755 --> 11:34.529
And when I get paid, I
want to come back for you.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.082
I'm gonna rescue you from Camomile forever.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.471
And I can be your assistant.

11:39.472 --> 11:40.892
No!

11:40.893 --> 11:43.155
We can be each other's assistants.

11:45.380 --> 11:48.029
All right. More money. More pictures.

11:48.030 --> 11:49.845
Whoo!

11:58.425 --> 12:00.619
A lot of noise for a man who doesn't exist.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.660
- Hey!
- Hey, uh, I know.

12:02.661 --> 12:05.116
Civilized liability. I
get it. But guess what?

12:05.117 --> 12:06.402
It's different this time,

12:06.403 --> 12:07.727
because I brought a pretty girl with me,

12:07.728 --> 12:09.148
and she's gonna be coming any minute.

12:09.149 --> 12:10.473
Yeah, well, if it's her

12:10.474 --> 12:12.066
I'll be coming any minute too.

12:14.381 --> 12:15.869
Hello, Kevin.

12:15.870 --> 12:17.774
What are you...? What are you doing here?

12:17.775 --> 12:20.617
You're kidding me, right?
I'm here for the subway job.

12:20.618 --> 12:22.916
How did you even know about the...?

12:23.906 --> 12:26.600
Sue.

12:35.084 --> 12:36.244
Uh, pardon me,

12:36.245 --> 12:37.829
uh, your excellency.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.599
Well, this is awkward.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.238
Ahem, miss White here
called late last night,

12:42.239 --> 12:43.848
and she expressed an
interest in helping out.

12:43.849 --> 12:45.547
And since I hadn't heard from you,

12:45.548 --> 12:46.877
I thought, you know,

12:46.878 --> 12:48.216
you're having difficulties
finishing the job.

12:48.217 --> 12:50.086
- No.
- So here we are.

12:50.087 --> 12:51.955
It's just I have more experience

12:51.956 --> 12:53.854
with these type of high-profile jobs.

12:53.855 --> 12:56.064
High-profile? No, you said you didn't want

12:56.065 --> 12:57.533
to go on record hiring a medium.

12:57.534 --> 12:59.802
I did not go on record about that.

12:59.803 --> 13:01.942
Besides, miss Camomile White

13:01.943 --> 13:03.771
is the most respected
spiritualist in the world, so...

13:03.772 --> 13:05.840
- Is she?
- It's kind of a no-brainer.

13:05.841 --> 13:07.710
- You're kind of a no-brainer!
- Brilliant.

13:07.711 --> 13:09.819
I'm sorry, Kevin. This is business.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.859
And to compensate for your time, here.

13:11.860 --> 13:14.028
It's the key to the city.

13:14.029 --> 13:16.198
It's chocolate.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.983
Let me jockey for position.

13:28.984 --> 13:30.213
Excuse me?

13:30.214 --> 13:32.622
You say this is all just business?

13:32.623 --> 13:34.921
Let me jockey for position, then.

13:34.922 --> 13:36.121
Me versus Camomile.

13:36.122 --> 13:37.330
Mano a womano.

13:37.331 --> 13:38.760
May the best medium win.

13:40.970 --> 13:43.098
Okay, okay, we can do that.

13:43.099 --> 13:44.138
- What?
- Yes!

13:44.139 --> 13:45.338
The two mediums

13:45.339 --> 13:46.047
who enter the tunnel,

13:46.048 --> 13:47.247
whoever gets rid of the ghost

13:47.248 --> 13:48.517
- gets the $10,000 fee.
- Yes.

13:48.518 --> 13:50.116
We'll call all the news outlets

13:50.117 --> 13:51.516
and make a big deal out of it.

13:51.517 --> 13:53.220
I just have to say sir. For me,

13:53.221 --> 13:54.585
it's not even about money.

13:54.586 --> 13:57.124
I just truly believe
in your administration,

13:57.125 --> 14:00.133
and I just really want to
make this subway project work.

14:00.134 --> 14:02.402
Yeah, and for me, sir, I
would really like to say

14:02.403 --> 14:05.171
that it is just about beating her.

14:05.172 --> 14:08.180
And the money, obviously. Also,
a little press never hurts.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.440
I have a meeting. Excuse me.

14:09.441 --> 14:11.179
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck to you both.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.079
Very good, your majesty. Thank you.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.289
I get to keep this?

14:16.619 --> 14:18.287
Guess so.

14:18.288 --> 14:20.396
This should be interesting.

14:20.397 --> 14:22.666
You ready to lose?

14:22.667 --> 14:24.966
Oh, I was born ready.

14:26.475 --> 14:28.404
Did everybody bring an egg

14:28.405 --> 14:30.073
like I asked you to?

14:30.074 --> 14:31.383
Okay, can I borrow off you?

14:31.384 --> 14:34.112
Eggs represent the tender area

14:34.113 --> 14:36.751
between life and non-life.

14:36.752 --> 14:39.511
Cracking these eggs on various rocks

14:39.512 --> 14:43.745
around the tunnel will determine
where the spirit resides.

14:43.746 --> 14:45.140
Bull snot.

14:45.141 --> 14:47.970
That is baloney of the grade-A variety.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.963
Mike O'Schmidt the ghost is
standing right next to me.

14:49.964 --> 14:51.158
Right here.

14:51.159 --> 14:52.693
No, he is.

14:52.694 --> 14:54.586
He's standing right here,
leaning off this post.

14:54.587 --> 14:56.489
Yeah, as a matter of fact, he's saying...

14:56.490 --> 15:00.584
he says, "Camomile, you can get
some sausage with your eggs."

15:00.585 --> 15:02.308
Bada-bing.

15:02.309 --> 15:04.410
Yeah, there's more. Hold on, there's more.

15:04.411 --> 15:08.138
He says, "is Camomile a
vegetarian? Because...

15:09.333 --> 15:11.066
No, I'm not gonna say that.

15:11.067 --> 15:12.321
Well, come on. What is he saying?

15:12.322 --> 15:13.626
He knows another way

15:13.627 --> 15:15.519
that you can get some protein in you.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.353
He did that, not me.

15:17.354 --> 15:19.076
Yeah, that does sound like Mikey.

15:19.077 --> 15:21.607
This is insane. He's putting
on a ventriloquist act

15:21.608 --> 15:23.002
to take jabs at me.

15:23.003 --> 15:24.407
You want us to believe

15:24.408 --> 15:26.200
that Mikey's standing there next to you?

15:26.201 --> 15:28.960
- Yes.
- Make him actually do something.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.863
- All right, I will.
- Do it.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.428
Piece of cake. Uh, Mikey,

15:32.429 --> 15:36.812
why don't you grab your
pickax and smash something.

15:36.813 --> 15:38.914
- Come on. You serious?
- Smash a rock. Smash a rock.

15:38.915 --> 15:41.176
Show Camomile how much of
a man you are. Come on.

15:41.177 --> 15:43.208
- Come on, do it. Yeah.
- All right.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.072
He's going to do it for her.

15:45.073 --> 15:46.467
Watch out. I got this.

15:46.468 --> 15:48.062
- Stand back.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:52.187 --> 15:54.019
Was that you?

15:54.020 --> 15:55.354
- I didn't do that.
- Hold on a minute.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.779
Okay, everybody just calm down.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.383
Take a breath. Stay calm.

15:58.384 --> 16:00.083
Stay there.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.255
I have a feeling...

16:03.395 --> 16:06.395
- What is that?
- Just as I suspected.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.536
A detonation device.

16:08.537 --> 16:10.276
No.

16:10.277 --> 16:14.417
He must have planted that there
earlier for this very use.

16:14.418 --> 16:16.188
No, that... no, that's nof mine.

16:16.189 --> 16:17.518
That is not my detonator.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.089
Smoke and mirrors, folks.

16:19.090 --> 16:20.389
Smoke and mirrors.

16:20.390 --> 16:24.800
Please ignore this insensitive distraction,

16:24.801 --> 16:27.571
and join me now in holding hands.

16:27.572 --> 16:31.482
And let's send Mikey into
the light with honor.

16:31.483 --> 16:33.953
- No.
- Everybody come together.

16:33.954 --> 16:36.123
All together, please. Hold hands.

16:36.124 --> 16:37.864
- Oh, my...
- Concentrate.

16:37.865 --> 16:40.135
Close your eyes.

16:40.136 --> 16:43.045
Mikey O'Schmidt, hear our voices.

16:43.046 --> 16:46.986
- You actually buying this?
- I'm right here.

16:46.987 --> 16:48.987
This place is no longer for you.

16:48.988 --> 16:51.298
- Leave this place. Move into the light.
- Tony!

16:51.299 --> 16:53.128
Roberto. Come on, guys.

16:53.129 --> 16:56.469
Mikey, O'Schmidt, a
higher power commands you

16:56.470 --> 16:58.341
Leave this place!

17:00.351 --> 17:02.521
Send him the message with your mind.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.521
- Tell him to leave this place.
- What's happening?

17:04.521 --> 17:06.462
- What's happening?
- I tried to tell you, Mikey,

17:06.463 --> 17:08.402
a bunch of times. You got into an accident.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.272
Look.

17:10.273 --> 17:12.604
Oh, no. I don't think it was an accident.

17:12.605 --> 17:14.074
Yes, it was. It was an accident.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.415
No. There was something else down here.

17:16.415 --> 17:19.285
It's something big,
it's something powerful.

17:19.286 --> 17:20.556
It's... it's something.

17:20.557 --> 17:22.567
That did that?

17:23.867 --> 17:26.007
- What?
- You got a giant head wound.

17:26.008 --> 17:27.578
- What did that to your head?
- I don't know

17:27.579 --> 17:29.378
Mikey O'Schmidt,

17:29.379 --> 17:30.979
move into the light.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.589
Your light is waiting.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.350
- No, no, no, Mikey.
- Something's here.

17:34.351 --> 17:36.890
- And may your light...
- You were right.

17:36.891 --> 17:38.161
Mike, tell me what you're talking about.

17:38.162 --> 17:39.901
- Shine bright.
- I gotta go.

17:39.902 --> 17:41.372
Hey, Mikey. No, no, no.

17:49.255 --> 17:52.164
The exorcism has worked.

17:52.165 --> 17:54.495
Mikey has passed into the light.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.036
Yes, yeah, yeah.

17:58.037 --> 18:00.307
Mikey, he moved on. But
that was coincidentally.

18:00.308 --> 18:02.347
That was a coincidence. She didn't do that.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.918
Listen, guys. There's something
here. There's something here.

18:04.919 --> 18:07.189
Something scary, something
more powerful than I thought.

18:07.190 --> 18:08.659
No, it's not... it's not funny.

18:08.660 --> 18:11.270
I'm not kidding. He had a giant brain gash.

18:11.271 --> 18:12.940
Guys, I'm not lying.

18:12.941 --> 18:14.381
That's probably what messed up his memory.

18:14.382 --> 18:16.011
- That's what put him on the...
- Lies.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.252
Lies. He's clearly making this up

18:18.253 --> 18:19.452
because he's a sore loser.

18:19.453 --> 18:21.151
I'm not lying!

18:21.152 --> 18:23.390
Fraud.

18:23.391 --> 18:25.700
Sue, the recording.

18:27.329 --> 18:30.137
A few weeks ago I met
up with Mr. Pacalioglu

18:30.138 --> 18:33.176
to discuss our respective abilities.

18:33.177 --> 18:36.674
Sue, hit play.

18:36.675 --> 18:38.513
Press...

18:38.514 --> 18:40.254
Sue.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.992
Just be honest.

18:42.993 --> 18:44.261
Are you like me?

18:44.262 --> 18:46.090
Can you actually see ghosts?

18:46.091 --> 18:47.529
- No.
- Have you ever

18:47.530 --> 18:51.068
seen a ghost in your life? I mean, please.

18:51.069 --> 18:52.597
- It's important.
- No.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.266
I have never seen a ghost.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.706
I don't even know how that would work...

18:55.707 --> 18:58.005
that could... that could
be anybody on there.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.244
I really want to
believe in you, Mr. Paclogaloogie.

19:00.245 --> 19:02.613
Oh, uh, close.

19:02.614 --> 19:05.292
Mr. Pacalioglu. Uh, I mean,
at least I think it is.

19:05.293 --> 19:06.922
I never met my parents.

19:13.229 --> 19:17.427
Your business is finished.

19:24.044 --> 19:25.513
I think maybe I can

19:25.514 --> 19:27.323
supply you with some
footage if you need it.

Go.

20:08.544 --> 20:10.314
Go, get out of here.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.329
You too Blob.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.198
What do you want? You want to sit around

20:20.199 --> 20:21.398
and eat junk food all day?

20:21.399 --> 20:22.767
Go do it somewhere else.

20:22.768 --> 20:24.596
Get lost.

20:25.488 --> 20:27.115
Just go.

Did you get them
all? Oh, you missed one.

20:43.428 --> 20:45.707
Okay, I think that's the last one.

20:45.708 --> 20:48.293
Uh, I think we should probably get going.

20:48.294 --> 20:49.864
You know, Sue, I have to say

20:49.865 --> 20:51.750
you've been on very
thin ice with me lately.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.691
But I really quite fancied that glam stunt.

20:54.692 --> 20:55.879
Yeah, about that... you know, I...

20:55.880 --> 20:57.124
I was under the impression

20:57.125 --> 20:58.465
that just one single overhead light

20:58.466 --> 20:59.806
was going to explode.

20:59.807 --> 21:02.306
But actually the shock
on my face really played.

21:02.307 --> 21:04.221
Yes, but I... I just wanted to let you know

21:04.222 --> 21:07.066
that you are back onto
ice of regular thickness.

21:07.067 --> 21:09.087
Miss white, please, I
have to confess something.

21:09.088 --> 21:11.232
I didn't rig those headlamps to explode.

21:11.233 --> 21:12.573
What?

21:12.574 --> 21:14.202
I think Kevin is right.

21:14.203 --> 21:17.659
Be very careful what you say next.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.805
I have to come clean. I believe in ghosts.

21:19.806 --> 21:21.500
I believe in Kevin.

21:21.501 --> 21:25.465
I think that that Mikey guy
was actually here as a ghost.

21:25.466 --> 21:27.352
And I think there's
something else in this cave.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.527
Something powerful.

21:29.528 --> 21:32.754
Oh, there is something powerful here, Sue.

21:32.755 --> 21:36.183
And that something needs a new assistant.

21:36.184 --> 21:37.812
Do you get where I'm going with this, Sue?

21:37.813 --> 21:39.794
That ice that I was talking about earlier

21:39.795 --> 21:41.844
not just cracked. Melted.

21:41.845 --> 21:44.593
And has no place in the
paranormal enterprise

21:44.594 --> 21:46.930
that is Camomile White.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.280
I think we're making a mistake.
