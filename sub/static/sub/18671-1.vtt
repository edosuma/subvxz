01:28.376 --> 01:30.371
My head.

02:02.094 --> 02:03.897
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil. How you been?

02:07.887 --> 02:10.687
Move. Move. I said move.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.449
First of all, A, I'm a cop.

02:13.641 --> 02:17.093
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.

02:17.477 --> 02:20.584
Doesn't it get itchy? Sweaty?

02:21.044 --> 02:22.041
The paper.

02:22.195 --> 02:26.261
Even though your face is covered,
I can tell, you need a hug.

02:27.527 --> 02:28.869
- Back off.
- Come on.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.442
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.

02:30.596 --> 02:32.130
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.

02:32.283 --> 02:34.355
No love? Really?

02:39.994 --> 02:41.375
You coming?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.331
- What did I do?
- How should I know?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.783
You gonna pick that up?

02:47.244 --> 02:49.085
Hurry, I gotta go to court.

02:58.752 --> 03:03.240
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet. Let's go.

03:10.528 --> 03:12.101
Thank you.

03:42.366 --> 03:45.397
Come on, man. You can't lock me up
for walking down the street.

03:45.550 --> 03:47.430
Guy with the persuader
pointed at my head?

03:47.583 --> 03:48.926
I don't know that guy.

03:49.079 --> 03:51.074
- What's in the paper?
- News. Newspaper.

03:51.496 --> 03:52.992
Wallet.

04:02.735 --> 04:04.615
And the gun.

04:07.876 --> 04:08.988
Okay, easy tiger.

04:12.172 --> 04:14.128
What's with the paper?

04:16.468 --> 04:19.844
This is a really unsatisfying
conversation.

04:20.688 --> 04:23.181
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?

04:23.335 --> 04:25.214
Better than you.

04:30.201 --> 04:31.620
He took my money.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.569
And when you tell me what
I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.

04:36.722 --> 04:38.256
Off to dance with Lady Justice.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.328
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.668
I've always been lucky.

04:45.506 --> 04:46.619
Hey. What the hell?

04:49.035 --> 04:50.071
Firearm.

04:50.225 --> 04:51.989
Thank you, sir.

04:58.357 --> 04:59.469
You're Lena Valoise.

04:59.853 --> 05:00.850
I was.

05:01.004 --> 05:03.152
Tomorrow, Again
is one of my favorite movies.

05:03.305 --> 05:04.379
Me too.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.489
- Nick.
- How do you do?

05:06.643 --> 05:08.330
Great. What are you doing here?

05:08.484 --> 05:10.670
I've come to see my son,
the assistant DA.

05:10.824 --> 05:11.975
Me too.

05:12.128 --> 05:14.391
- You must be very proud.
- I must.

05:14.545 --> 05:17.153
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.

05:17.805 --> 05:20.414
- You look a little lost.
- I am. Courtroom 3?

05:20.567 --> 05:22.600
Come. I'll show you.

05:46.421 --> 05:49.145
We call it the thin blue line, the police.

05:49.298 --> 05:51.715
The fragile barrier
between the bad guys and you.

05:52.175 --> 05:56.664
We give policemen
like Detective Nick Blades guns.

05:56.817 --> 05:57.814
We pay them well.

05:58.428 --> 06:02.763
And all we ask in return
is that they do what they swear they'll do.

06:02.916 --> 06:03.990
Protect and serve.

06:04.182 --> 06:06.138
But what happens
if they break that promise?

06:06.330 --> 06:09.706
What happens if one day you can't tell
the good guys from the bad guys?

06:09.859 --> 06:12.736
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold
care to join us in this case?

06:12.890 --> 06:15.153
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.

06:15.306 --> 06:16.802
Anarchy.

06:16.956 --> 06:20.485
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully
wears in this courtroom...

06:20.638 --> 06:22.211
...is emblematic of the point.

06:22.364 --> 06:24.091
- Objection.
- Sustained.

06:24.244 --> 06:26.546
When I was a kid,
I believed in Batman and Superman.

06:26.699 --> 06:29.077
- Mr. Gold....
- You know what? I still do.

06:29.231 --> 06:31.456
I believe there is such a thing
as right and wrong.

06:31.648 --> 06:34.333
I believe in an irrepressible commitment
to the truth.

06:34.524 --> 06:38.897
An irreproachable moral and ethical code
that cannot be compromised.

06:39.051 --> 06:42.810
Detective Blades thought
he could be the law, but not follow it.

06:43.462 --> 06:45.188
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.564
That's wrong.

06:49.331 --> 06:50.329
Thank you.

06:55.469 --> 06:57.732
We will adjourn for the day.

06:58.346 --> 07:00.954
First time he called the police on me
he was 9.

07:01.108 --> 07:04.253
- What'd you do?
- I took away his LEGOs.

07:04.867 --> 07:05.864
Mr. Gold.

07:06.018 --> 07:08.012
Your reaction
to the DA's decision to retire?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.659
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.

07:10.851 --> 07:13.728
Do you have any comments
on a frontrunner for the interim slot?

07:14.112 --> 07:15.953
I've been dealing with police corruption.

07:16.106 --> 07:19.175
It doesn't leave a lot of time
to deal with office personnel matters.

07:19.329 --> 07:22.704
Do you plan on attending
Willie Van Beber's execution?

07:24.047 --> 07:25.696
I did my job...

07:25.888 --> 07:28.266
...putting Willie Van Beber
right where he belongs.

07:28.420 --> 07:31.297
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner
take it from there.

07:31.489 --> 07:33.061
Excuse me.

07:33.215 --> 07:36.667
You people don't mind if I borrow my son,
the assistant DA, do you?

07:36.821 --> 07:38.739
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.002
You sure you don't have
an announcement to make?

07:41.155 --> 07:42.574
Your father is having an affair.

07:42.728 --> 07:45.336
Would you and the good Lord
care to comment on that?

07:45.528 --> 07:47.638
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?

07:47.791 --> 07:50.285
Every time you say
Dad's having sex with someone else.

07:50.438 --> 07:52.548
Go to the country house.

08:05.207 --> 08:06.166
Where's the van?

08:06.357 --> 08:08.582
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.536
I thought we'd agree
we only use the Hawk in an emergency.

08:11.689 --> 08:15.410
This is an emergency. Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1 :30.

08:15.564 --> 08:18.364
Honey, this car represents
the last fragile thread of dignity...

08:18.556 --> 08:21.356
...holding my family together.
Take my car. Park in my spot.

08:21.510 --> 08:22.852
Theo.

08:25.652 --> 08:29.181
I thought on people's birthdays, other
people are supposed to do what they want.

08:29.373 --> 08:31.867
And I thought turning 40
meant not acting 7.

08:39.001 --> 08:44.372
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch
with the next DA.

08:44.564 --> 08:47.095
Great. And you'll still earn less
than our gardener...

08:47.249 --> 08:50.164
...and I'll still be paying for lunch
with my parents' credit card.

08:50.356 --> 08:52.504
Jeez, Kelly, come on. Don't do this.

08:52.658 --> 08:56.302
Just give me today. You're the one who
wants to live in a house big enough for 12.

08:56.455 --> 08:58.603
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.

08:59.601 --> 09:00.790
I'm leaving.

09:01.212 --> 09:02.247
I'm not done yet.

09:02.401 --> 09:04.472
Leaving you.

09:04.664 --> 09:07.503
Actually, you're the one leaving
since my parents own the house.

09:07.656 --> 09:10.034
I'll give you one week
to get your things and get out.

09:10.188 --> 09:13.947
Today you do this? Today?
On my birthday?

09:14.101 --> 09:16.632
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years...

09:16.824 --> 09:19.394
...I've wasted on someone
going precisely nowhere?

09:20.507 --> 09:22.194
Kelly, come on.

09:22.348 --> 09:25.302
Wait a minute. What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.

09:25.493 --> 09:29.444
Really? And how many hours do you
spend with them on any given week?

09:29.598 --> 09:32.245
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.

09:32.436 --> 09:35.735
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you
three times what the DA's job pays.

09:35.889 --> 09:38.037
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.032
I believe in what I do. Is that so wrong?

09:40.185 --> 09:43.446
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?

09:45.402 --> 09:48.241
Yeah? Okay.

09:49.468 --> 09:51.425
They want me back.

09:51.578 --> 09:53.496
- Right away, sir.
- Good.

09:53.688 --> 09:55.414
Because I don't.

10:08.763 --> 10:09.722
I'm sorry.

10:11.026 --> 10:13.942
Please remember
to put the cover back on the Hawk.

10:24.222 --> 10:27.214
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.

10:27.367 --> 10:29.823
I've received the following note
from the jurors.

10:29.976 --> 10:31.319
"We have voted several times.

10:31.510 --> 10:34.963
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."

10:35.155 --> 10:38.492
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.

10:38.645 --> 10:41.829
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.

10:41.983 --> 10:44.131
Would you like to set the matter
for retrial?

10:44.284 --> 10:46.279
Yes. Absolutely, yes.

10:48.350 --> 10:51.381
Blades? I don't care what the jury did.

10:51.572 --> 10:54.948
You're on leave until you deal
with Internal Affairs. Do you hear me?

10:55.102 --> 10:58.439
Until I say so, you are not police.

10:58.592 --> 11:01.699
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA,
they're gonna rush out...

11:01.853 --> 11:05.267
...and get my name tattooed
across their butt cheeks.

11:07.185 --> 11:09.026
- Give me five.
- Nice going.

11:09.180 --> 11:12.402
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.

11:13.054 --> 11:15.125
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?

11:15.317 --> 11:17.542
Was in Interview 4,
but Schaefer needed the room...

11:17.695 --> 11:20.265
...so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?

11:20.419 --> 11:22.951
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate? I'm buying.

11:23.104 --> 11:24.677
You're buying? Or is Gil buying?

11:24.830 --> 11:26.978
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.

11:27.132 --> 11:29.472
He was carrying the paper the cash
when I popped him.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.502
Then some ape in a wool ski mask
came at me with a piece.

11:32.694 --> 11:34.842
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?

11:34.996 --> 11:37.105
There's numbers and letters
circled all over it.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.944
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.

11:40.097 --> 11:42.667
I tried to decipher it
but Gold's closing was distracting.

11:42.821 --> 11:45.084
Sure. Yeah, I'll check it out.

11:45.429 --> 11:46.964
I'll go sit on Gil.

11:47.156 --> 11:49.841
Blades strikes me
as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.

11:50.033 --> 11:51.759
He's dirty.

11:52.181 --> 11:55.365
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.

11:55.518 --> 11:59.469
Yes, exactly. We used to call that felony
larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.

11:59.622 --> 12:02.691
I understand Internal Affairs
is going to water board him next week.

12:02.845 --> 12:04.609
Trust cops to deal with cops?

12:04.763 --> 12:08.484
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.706
Wouldn't it be nice
if life was all blacks and whites?

12:11.859 --> 12:14.506
Turns out, it's mostly grays.

12:15.005 --> 12:19.071
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.

12:19.224 --> 12:21.104
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.

12:21.296 --> 12:23.789
Am I supposed to see the forest
or mostly grays?

12:23.942 --> 12:26.244
Look, everything I know
comes from you.

12:26.397 --> 12:29.083
A much younger and stupider me.

12:29.735 --> 12:32.497
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.

12:32.688 --> 12:36.409
Good. Grant Stone's gonna get
the interim appointment as the DA.

12:36.563 --> 12:38.634
You're kidding? Grant Stone?

12:38.788 --> 12:41.319
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.

12:41.511 --> 12:44.618
And everyone in the office thinks
you're an asshole. So do the judges.

12:44.772 --> 12:45.961
Most of the defense bar.

12:46.153 --> 12:48.224
I should start caring about
defense lawyers?

12:48.378 --> 12:50.411
Everybody in the system
gets chewed up, Theo.

12:50.564 --> 12:52.559
Including the poor bastards
we send to prison.

12:52.751 --> 12:56.165
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--

12:56.318 --> 12:58.965
Theo. Take some time off.

12:59.118 --> 13:01.688
Go home. Look in the mirror.

13:07.519 --> 13:09.821
I need Gil Ott for an interview.

13:11.086 --> 13:12.659
- Not here.
- Where is he?

13:13.887 --> 13:16.188
Check again. Detective Schaefer
brought him earlier.

13:16.342 --> 13:18.989
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.

13:19.180 --> 13:22.479
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want? I just came on.

13:22.633 --> 13:24.858
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.

13:25.011 --> 13:27.773
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.

14:29.340 --> 14:32.064
What the crap? Come on.

14:48.405 --> 14:49.939
What's up with the sneak attack?

14:50.093 --> 14:52.087
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

14:52.241 --> 14:53.238
I'm a DA.

14:53.392 --> 14:57.381
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

14:57.803 --> 14:59.798
License.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.790
My registration.

15:03.135 --> 15:06.127
Have you had anything to drink tonight,
Mr. Gould, is it?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.886
It's Gold. Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.569
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.

15:13.722 --> 15:16.100
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.

15:16.292 --> 15:18.440
Mr. Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.

15:18.632 --> 15:22.046
If you do not calm down,
I will have to place you under arrest.

15:22.391 --> 15:24.578
Are you joking? What is all this about?

15:24.770 --> 15:27.071
- Please step out of the car.
- No.

15:27.225 --> 15:29.757
Mr. Gold, please step out
of the vehicle now.

15:29.910 --> 15:32.442
I am placing you under arrest.

15:32.825 --> 15:35.587
This is absolutely ridiculous.

15:35.779 --> 15:37.850
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.229
- No, I'm not.
- You are definitely resisting arrest.

15:40.421 --> 15:41.610
What are you talking about?

15:41.801 --> 15:44.103
If you continue to resist arrest,
I will Tase you.

15:44.256 --> 15:46.481
Are you out of your freaking mind?

15:51.622 --> 15:54.383
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.

15:54.575 --> 15:57.222
Make the call. Let's go 10-99.

16:02.554 --> 16:03.858
Detective Nick Blades...

16:04.012 --> 16:08.001
...there's something shocking
you should see, State and Chestnut.

16:29.061 --> 16:30.441
Get the hell away from me.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.743
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.

16:32.896 --> 16:34.469
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.576
Just leave me alone.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.338
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.

16:40.492 --> 16:42.947
I've seen Tomorrow, Again
like 50 times.

16:43.139 --> 16:46.284
Please don't speak to me.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.279
What happened?

16:48.586 --> 16:53.342
Two policemen kidnapped
and Tased me.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.567
Friends of yours, I presume.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.099
I've never been Tased myself.

16:58.444 --> 17:02.011
Imagine the worst dental appointment
of all time.

17:06.461 --> 17:07.996
You got lucky, detective.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.103
It won't happen again.

17:12.061 --> 17:13.212
I've always been lucky.

17:15.207 --> 17:16.857
Today's my birthday.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.810
I hope it's the best one ever.

17:55.293 --> 17:56.367
Kelly!

17:56.521 --> 17:59.436
No, no. Don't do this to me.

17:59.819 --> 18:01.469
Kelly.

18:01.852 --> 18:03.387
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.650
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.

18:05.804 --> 18:07.913
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!

18:08.105 --> 18:09.985
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead...

18:10.138 --> 18:12.171
...apparently,
your precious Hawk is missing...

18:12.325 --> 18:14.588
...and you may remember,
I'm going to my parents...

18:14.741 --> 18:18.155
...until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.

18:18.309 --> 18:19.613
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.

18:20.227 --> 18:23.871
Just give me a little more time
to explain to the kids.

18:29.510 --> 18:32.540
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys. Daddy loves you.

18:32.732 --> 18:34.151
See you soon.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.659
This asshole must be having
the worst day of his life.

18:45.813 --> 18:49.534
He just called in to report that
someone stole his car out of his driveway.

18:50.761 --> 18:53.024
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.

18:53.216 --> 18:56.055
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?

18:57.052 --> 18:59.507
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?

19:00.082 --> 19:02.768
You know what happens
when you wake up in the morning...

19:02.921 --> 19:05.836
...and you can't tell the difference between
good guys and bad?

19:05.990 --> 19:08.560
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.

19:08.713 --> 19:10.286
Anarchy.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.278
And the Cubs win the World Series.

19:14.889 --> 19:19.416
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.

19:29.696 --> 19:30.693
Yeah?

19:30.847 --> 19:33.954
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.

19:34.146 --> 19:37.943
We've done our share of fooling around
over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.

19:38.097 --> 19:42.048
It's time for him to hang up his sword and
die with something approaching dignity.

19:42.547 --> 19:44.043
Mom, I don't need to hear this.

19:44.196 --> 19:46.920
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.

19:47.073 --> 19:49.950
I thought it was the cancer,
so I didn't push. But now I know.

19:50.142 --> 19:54.400
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.

19:54.553 --> 19:57.277
What time are you picking us up
for lunch?

19:59.233 --> 20:00.269
Theo?

20:00.422 --> 20:03.031
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.

20:03.184 --> 20:04.718
- So take the van.
- It's dead.

20:04.872 --> 20:09.015
Again? All right, you have my permission
to use the Hawk, just be very careful.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.968
- I can't.
- Why not? What's wrong with the Hawk?

20:13.349 --> 20:15.382
I don't believe this.

20:16.610 --> 20:17.569
I gotta go.

20:17.761 --> 20:20.561
If something happens to that automobile,
it'll kill your father.

20:20.714 --> 20:24.589
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.

20:47.566 --> 20:49.484
Move out of the street.

20:50.213 --> 20:54.317
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.

20:54.471 --> 20:57.386
Please move out of the street
or I'll have to cite you.

20:58.345 --> 21:00.839
I'm bleeding here. I'm bleeding here.

21:00.992 --> 21:03.409
Move now.

21:16.988 --> 21:20.862
My car was stolen. I saw the guy driving it
around the corner two minutes ago.

21:21.054 --> 21:25.504
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh? Shocking.

21:25.657 --> 21:30.299
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.

21:30.491 --> 21:32.063
I don't see anything.

21:32.217 --> 21:34.940
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.469
You know, I'm about to go off shift
if you want a ride downtown.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.579
Thank you.

22:02.828 --> 22:04.861
Okay, Blades,
so now you're buying two dinners.

22:05.014 --> 22:06.932
And not the Whole Foods deli again,
either.

22:07.086 --> 22:09.157
Someplace where they bring food
to the table.

22:09.311 --> 22:11.190
Let's see what you got,
then we'll decide.

22:11.344 --> 22:15.218
Well, it was code. Forensics figures it
for driver's license numbers.

22:15.410 --> 22:16.829
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

22:16.982 --> 22:20.396
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep. And it's four local Louisiana plates.

22:20.550 --> 22:22.545
It's just that there are three extra letters.

22:22.736 --> 22:25.307
WVB or BVW,
depending on how you read it.

22:25.498 --> 22:29.718
But one of the cars is registered
to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.

22:29.871 --> 22:32.748
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.

22:32.902 --> 22:36.431
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.730
If we have the list and Gil's in jail,
how does the car get stolen?

22:39.922 --> 22:42.492
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.

22:42.645 --> 22:45.752
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.

22:45.944 --> 22:48.092
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.

22:48.246 --> 22:49.550
Check with Schaefer and Chin.

22:49.703 --> 22:52.350
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses
on my way to Gil's.

22:52.503 --> 22:53.501
Okay.

22:55.572 --> 22:57.145
Hi, Nick.

22:57.682 --> 22:59.216
Blades. Goddamn it.

22:59.408 --> 23:02.861
If you're out there impersonating
a police officer, I will pinch you myself.

23:03.014 --> 23:05.776
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.

23:05.929 --> 23:07.962
In the meantime,
I'm having my teeth cleaned...

23:08.116 --> 23:09.382
...and maybe a trim.

23:22.155 --> 23:26.260
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.

23:26.413 --> 23:29.942
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.

23:30.134 --> 23:34.584
So as soon as we can unplug an officer
from another matter, we'll be with you.

23:34.737 --> 23:38.995
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor
and tell him to come out here now.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.831
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs
to see you.

23:43.253 --> 23:44.673
Thank you, sir.

23:46.514 --> 23:47.856
Yes?

23:48.393 --> 23:50.311
I understand that my reputation
precedes me.

23:50.465 --> 23:53.188
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour...

23:53.342 --> 23:56.180
...my car was stolen,
and I just want a little help. That's all.

23:56.372 --> 23:59.633
Despite the fact you've been trying
to put one of my best cops in jail...

23:59.786 --> 24:01.858
...I find this conversation scintillating.

24:02.011 --> 24:06.499
You, in fact,
may describe it as electrifying.

24:26.101 --> 24:27.789
- How you doing?
- Good.

24:27.981 --> 24:29.975
I'm detective Nick Blades,
New Orleans police.

24:30.129 --> 24:32.814
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.

24:33.006 --> 24:35.077
- Your parents home?
- No.

24:35.231 --> 24:37.034
- They at work?
- No.

24:38.031 --> 24:40.256
- I give up. Where are they?
- Dead.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.938
My grandma says
that if she was on the jury...

24:44.092 --> 24:45.664
...she'd vote to send you to jail.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.119
I guess I'm glad
your grandma's not on the jury.

24:48.772 --> 24:51.495
My grandma says
you should be ashamed of yourself.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.449
I am. Your grandma take care of you?

24:54.986 --> 24:56.942
- Yeah.
- Is she home?

24:57.134 --> 24:58.093
No.

24:58.285 --> 25:00.816
Is that your grandma's car
in the driveway?

25:01.430 --> 25:03.770
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?

25:04.230 --> 25:06.340
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?

25:06.494 --> 25:08.488
- Yeah.
- Is he home?

25:08.642 --> 25:10.138
- No.

25:10.330 --> 25:12.209
- Where's he?
- Jail.

25:13.590 --> 25:15.048
Does he get out soon?

25:15.201 --> 25:18.654
My grandma said it depends if his jury
is as dumb as yours.

25:20.303 --> 25:22.183
Tell your grandma
to lock the car up tight.

25:22.681 --> 25:24.139
All right.

26:12.626 --> 26:16.040
- Hand over the money already.
- It's not like it's because you got nothing.

26:16.193 --> 26:17.728
Yeah, well.

26:36.524 --> 26:37.675
It's okay, guys.

26:45.116 --> 26:48.108
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.717
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot? He just said that.

26:51.407 --> 26:52.903
Never heard of you. Let's see it.

27:07.787 --> 27:09.667
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.

27:12.659 --> 27:13.656
Enjoy.

27:14.385 --> 27:16.571
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.

27:16.725 --> 27:19.371
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know. Ask him.

27:19.525 --> 27:21.443
What you want with Gil?

27:22.632 --> 27:23.783
Where is the little creep?

27:23.975 --> 27:27.274
After he robbed 400 off me,
he didn't leave no forwarding address.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.805
- You see him with this guy?
- No.

27:29.997 --> 27:32.452
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?

27:32.606 --> 27:36.058
All I know is, last time I saw him,
he was okay.

27:36.211 --> 27:38.820
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.

27:38.973 --> 27:41.236
I chose Olive Garden.

27:41.390 --> 27:43.730
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?

27:45.034 --> 27:46.492
Thank you.

27:48.832 --> 27:52.207
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.

27:54.586 --> 27:57.539
I also took that off Gil.

27:57.693 --> 28:01.375
Call 911. Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.

28:07.206 --> 28:08.894
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.

28:09.047 --> 28:10.160
I'm sure they'll find it.

28:10.351 --> 28:12.998
But with my luck,
somebody will probably have peed in it.

28:13.612 --> 28:15.799
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?

28:15.952 --> 28:18.637
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.

28:18.829 --> 28:20.133
Well, also in the meantime...

28:20.287 --> 28:22.818
...my wife is taking away my kids,
my car was stolen...

28:22.972 --> 28:25.657
...and because of Blades,
I'm getting no help from the cops.

28:26.156 --> 28:29.416
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.

28:31.948 --> 28:35.055
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.

28:35.209 --> 28:37.280
I should have listened.

28:38.124 --> 28:42.458
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.

28:42.612 --> 28:45.067
That's much better than rotting teeth.

28:48.212 --> 28:50.821
You mentioned the Van Beber case.

28:51.243 --> 28:52.547
Here's the murder book.

28:52.969 --> 28:56.728
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.

28:56.882 --> 28:59.682
And everyone was mad at me
for not dealing.

28:59.835 --> 29:02.712
The judge was mad at me
for ruining his summer vacation.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.167
The boss didn't want me tied up
for three months.

29:05.321 --> 29:08.390
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.

29:08.543 --> 29:11.650
Plead it. Settle it. Compromise.

29:11.957 --> 29:15.831
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber
gets his just punishment...

29:15.985 --> 29:17.711
...because I refused to compromise.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.511
Grab that, will you?

29:22.122 --> 29:23.388
- Hello?
- Kelly...

29:23.542 --> 29:25.575
...you get your husband
on the phone right now.

29:25.767 --> 29:28.528
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.

29:28.682 --> 29:31.098
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.

29:31.789 --> 29:32.978
- Yeah.
- Who was that?

29:33.132 --> 29:34.896
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.

29:35.050 --> 29:38.464
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger
about our problems like it's CNN.

29:38.655 --> 29:41.494
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

29:41.647 --> 29:45.215
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly
he insisted we come to your house.

29:45.368 --> 29:48.130
When you weren't here,
he got very upset and locked himself...

29:48.284 --> 29:50.547
- ...in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?

29:50.700 --> 29:53.846
Apparently. He must've had it
in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears...

29:53.999 --> 29:57.221
- ...like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?

29:57.375 --> 29:59.907
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.

30:00.098 --> 30:02.285
You can buy guns
in vending machines now.

30:02.438 --> 30:04.817
- Call the cops.
- No. I will not have some SWAT team...

30:04.970 --> 30:07.579
...blasting through the door
scaring your father to death.

30:07.732 --> 30:11.223
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can. I gotta go.

30:20.007 --> 30:23.037
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.

30:28.753 --> 30:32.704
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.

30:34.277 --> 30:36.693
Where'd you get those tickets? Kinko's?

30:37.269 --> 30:39.033
Nice pants.

30:40.529 --> 30:42.371
Nick? Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

30:42.524 --> 30:44.442
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?

30:44.634 --> 30:47.396
He's been threatening to kill himself
for the last 20 minutes.

30:47.549 --> 30:50.350
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.728
Herb, I want the truth.

30:52.881 --> 30:55.451
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.

30:55.643 --> 30:57.484
Along with everything else,
he's cheating.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.978
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?

31:00.553 --> 31:02.164
Herb. What did you do?

31:03.737 --> 31:05.617
- Wait.
- Marty. Holy moly.

31:05.770 --> 31:07.074
Put down the gun.

31:07.266 --> 31:10.834
- Oh, Lord. Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.

31:10.987 --> 31:11.984
He's not well, Nick.

31:12.138 --> 31:15.820
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky. He won't shoot Marty.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.736
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.

31:19.426 --> 31:20.845
You need a haircut.

31:20.999 --> 31:24.873
I said I'd stay with him in sickness
and in health.

31:25.027 --> 31:27.482
Now he's sick and I'm staying.

31:27.673 --> 31:29.438
But I can't abide the cheating.

31:29.745 --> 31:32.046
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.770
Just follow him. I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.

31:34.923 --> 31:37.110
That sounds like a bad idea.

31:37.570 --> 31:39.296
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?

31:39.488 --> 31:42.327
I heard about your son's car being stolen,
thought I could help.

31:42.519 --> 31:44.091
What car?

31:44.628 --> 31:48.656
- Oh, my God. The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?

31:48.810 --> 31:51.265
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?

31:51.456 --> 31:54.142
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.

31:54.295 --> 31:57.287
Detective Blades happened to stop by
and everything's under control.

31:57.441 --> 31:59.627
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.120
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.

32:02.274 --> 32:04.767
He's agreed to help find the car.

32:04.959 --> 32:06.839
And the other matter?

32:07.146 --> 32:09.754
Forget the other matter for the moment.

32:10.214 --> 32:12.439
You and Theo find the Hawk.

32:12.593 --> 32:15.393
I'll do everything I can
to keep this from your father.

32:15.546 --> 32:17.234
I'll expect regular reports.

32:19.651 --> 32:22.144
- She wants reports.
- I heard.

32:32.348 --> 32:34.649
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.

32:34.956 --> 32:38.984
This is a very comfortable mattress.

32:39.137 --> 32:41.631
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.

32:41.823 --> 32:43.549
Kelly bought it.

32:47.231 --> 32:50.492
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.

32:51.144 --> 32:54.942
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?

32:55.133 --> 32:58.279
Same reason everybody buys one.

32:58.547 --> 33:01.118
It's a crazy world out there, son.

33:01.309 --> 33:04.877
And I got like 30 percent off.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.211
Don't you tell your mother.

33:12.395 --> 33:14.237
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.

33:14.390 --> 33:17.651
Am I dreaming this
or is your Uncle Marty here?

33:18.456 --> 33:19.415
Uncle Marty?

33:20.758 --> 33:22.714
Of course, he had to leave.

33:24.325 --> 33:25.975
Took my gun.

33:27.317 --> 33:29.695
I think that's probably for the best.

33:30.194 --> 33:33.723
Theo, your mother
has to try this mattress.

33:33.915 --> 33:38.672
I mean, it is incredible. You should try it.

33:39.285 --> 33:42.009
Come on. Try it. Come on.

33:54.169 --> 33:56.125
Yeah. So?

33:56.892 --> 34:00.268
It is. It's a great mattress.

34:01.419 --> 34:06.329
It is sublime is what it is.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.129
Yeah.

34:10.088 --> 34:11.583
It's nice.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.016
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.935
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.

34:39.088 --> 34:41.812
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.

34:41.965 --> 34:43.384
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.

34:43.538 --> 34:46.376
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck. Monday, on a ship.

34:46.530 --> 34:48.946
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.

34:49.138 --> 34:51.670
Trust me, you're not getting any play
from the department.

34:51.862 --> 34:54.777
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.

34:54.969 --> 34:58.038
You get your way, I'm gonna need
all the money I can scrape together.

34:58.191 --> 35:00.953
I'm not dropping the charges,
even if you do find the car.

35:01.145 --> 35:03.792
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.

35:03.945 --> 35:06.669
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.

35:06.822 --> 35:09.277
- You know him?
- How would I know him?

35:09.469 --> 35:12.806
Gil was carrying a newspaper with
plates numbers written in code on it.

35:13.535 --> 35:15.223
Your plate number was on the list.

35:15.415 --> 35:18.867
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye
on the Hawk. It's a very nice car.

35:19.020 --> 35:21.591
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.659
I wasted every weekend of my childhood
working on that damn car.

35:26.462 --> 35:29.339
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.

35:30.874 --> 35:32.293
I get it.

35:32.638 --> 35:35.975
So, what do we do? We go see Ott,
you slap him around a little...

35:36.129 --> 35:37.548
...he tells us where my car is?

35:37.702 --> 35:41.000
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court,
so I had to park him.

35:41.154 --> 35:44.146
While you were blasting me
in front of the jury, he slipped.

35:44.299 --> 35:46.294
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.

35:46.486 --> 35:49.555
But I'll assume that he delivered
a copy of the list once he got out.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.434
So how do we find my car?

35:51.895 --> 35:53.429
How should I know?

35:54.043 --> 35:56.728
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.

35:56.881 --> 35:59.528
Although, technically,
I'm on administrative leave.

35:59.682 --> 36:02.674
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.

36:03.057 --> 36:04.745
Don't do that.

36:10.499 --> 36:11.496
What--?

36:12.801 --> 36:14.143
What--?

36:19.552 --> 36:22.544
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?

36:22.697 --> 36:24.500
I'm a lawyer. My mind is my weapon.

36:24.654 --> 36:27.914
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me
long before I find your car.

36:35.049 --> 36:36.392
Come on.

36:38.387 --> 36:41.570
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.

36:41.724 --> 36:43.412
Why are we here?

36:44.601 --> 36:46.327
Come on, let's go.

36:47.631 --> 36:51.007
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.

36:52.081 --> 36:55.994
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.

36:56.185 --> 37:00.443
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.

37:01.709 --> 37:04.548
Gentlemen, we honor the master
and the practice...

37:04.701 --> 37:07.271
...by bowing when we enter the dojo.

37:16.439 --> 37:18.511
We're police. You Edward Mackie?

37:22.960 --> 37:25.876
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.098
Are you insane?

37:36.808 --> 37:39.685
Ever see that scene in Indiana jones
where he watches some guy...

37:39.839 --> 37:42.255
...with a big sword do his thing
and then shoots him?

37:42.447 --> 37:44.288
In this situation, I'm Indy.

37:50.426 --> 37:52.612
Move. Now.

37:52.766 --> 37:56.640
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--

37:59.325 --> 38:00.706
Move.

38:07.496 --> 38:08.915
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

38:09.107 --> 38:11.255
Theodore, put thing down
before you kill someone.

38:17.009 --> 38:20.308
Hey. Hey, give me a break.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.262
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?

38:23.799 --> 38:25.410
It's already in the book.

38:27.443 --> 38:29.246
Thanks for everything.

38:29.399 --> 38:32.161
That's why those people
are so widely despised.

38:32.315 --> 38:35.575
There's no give and take.
No compromise.

38:36.419 --> 38:38.951
What does any of this
have to do with my car?

38:39.104 --> 38:42.211
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.

38:42.787 --> 38:45.319
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.

38:45.472 --> 38:48.272
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.

38:50.651 --> 38:52.377
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.371
In prison,
he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.

38:54.525 --> 38:57.862
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect,
looking for Gil at his father's place.

38:58.016 --> 39:01.123
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names
before I do more good deeds.

39:01.276 --> 39:04.153
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning. He's in jail.

39:04.307 --> 39:06.608
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?

39:06.800 --> 39:08.948
The boy's running
so he must have burned somebody.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.441
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.

39:11.633 --> 39:14.664
I seem to recall something about
my mother paying you to find my car?

39:14.855 --> 39:17.234
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?

39:17.426 --> 39:20.226
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?

39:20.379 --> 39:23.486
Possibly. There seems to be a connection
between gangs and the list.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.862
Before I was chief assistant,
I did head up the gang prosecution unit.

39:27.015 --> 39:29.739
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?

39:29.931 --> 39:31.964
- Really.
- Isn't he about to be executed?

39:32.117 --> 39:34.035
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.

39:39.099 --> 39:40.134
Get in.

39:41.132 --> 39:43.050
Get in. Come on, move, move.

39:43.242 --> 39:45.735
- You, too.
- Let's go.

39:46.349 --> 39:47.730
Come on, let's go.

39:47.921 --> 39:49.724
Go, go, go.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.777
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.

39:58.931 --> 40:01.462
No, thanks. You're like a walking clichÃ©.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.953
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.

40:05.413 --> 40:08.175
Brother Blades. So nice to see you.

40:08.367 --> 40:11.513
Happy, this is my partner,
Roberto Clemente.

40:11.666 --> 40:15.042
The sainted ballplayer. It's my honor.

40:15.234 --> 40:18.686
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott
and he ends up locked up.

40:18.839 --> 40:20.105
You know anything about that?

40:20.297 --> 40:22.292
I heard some old guys
kicked the shit out him.

40:22.445 --> 40:25.514
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.

40:25.706 --> 40:30.808
Give me six maple, two glazed,
and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.608
And I'll need the paper back
when you're done reading it.

40:37.290 --> 40:40.935
It's like warm maple syrup
being poured over your tongue.

40:42.737 --> 40:45.576
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.

40:46.343 --> 40:48.875
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?

40:49.067 --> 40:52.020
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.125
Why do they never see that coming?

41:00.460 --> 41:02.876
What a waste of 50 grand.

41:03.145 --> 41:06.060
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.

41:18.258 --> 41:21.250
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.818
That one on the list?

41:28.424 --> 41:29.728
Yep.

41:30.150 --> 41:31.301
It's mine.

41:31.493 --> 41:34.063
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.

41:34.216 --> 41:36.172
Yeah. I'll make sure to use my Club.

41:36.901 --> 41:39.011
That was my guy yesterday,
outside the bar.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.392
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.

41:40.584 --> 41:41.811
Why a wool mask in July?

41:41.965 --> 41:44.381
I was hoping to grab Gil
before he delivered the paper.

41:44.573 --> 41:46.875
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.

41:47.028 --> 41:49.253
No, the paper wasn't for me.

41:49.406 --> 41:53.166
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily
bad reputation, Blades.

41:53.319 --> 41:58.114
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor
convicts on the four yard at Angola.

41:58.306 --> 42:00.838
I was one of them. It was a social club.

42:01.029 --> 42:03.753
I understand you've since
diversified considerably.

42:04.290 --> 42:09.891
And like all other complex organizations,
we have our internal differences.

42:10.504 --> 42:13.918
The newspaper was a delivery
from Willie Van Beber...

42:14.072 --> 42:16.450
...to a pro hitter, identity unknown.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.061
You know who Van Beber is?

42:18.215 --> 42:21.245
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?

42:21.398 --> 42:25.311
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.

42:25.465 --> 42:27.037
He's running out of time.

42:27.229 --> 42:30.336
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?

42:30.490 --> 42:32.024
I believe I do.

42:32.177 --> 42:35.400
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.

42:35.591 --> 42:37.816
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.

42:37.970 --> 42:41.691
I need Gil because he's the one
that can ID the person out on the street...

42:41.844 --> 42:43.724
...taking orders from Van Beber.

42:43.877 --> 42:45.220
- Still with me?
- Yeah.

42:45.412 --> 42:49.171
If you hadn't popped Gil,
I'd have his contact and it would be over.

42:49.976 --> 42:53.736
I'm genuinely sorry. I had no idea
my nose was in your business.

42:53.927 --> 42:57.341
- Yeah. These things happen.
- So where's Ed?

42:57.802 --> 43:01.024
Ed's dead. Or will be shortly.

43:01.216 --> 43:04.246
And you better keep your eye
on your little pal Roberto the DA...

43:04.400 --> 43:06.433
...because if he's not on the list,
he will be.

43:06.624 --> 43:09.233
You know
he's the one that put Willie down.

43:09.386 --> 43:10.882
He's on the list.

43:11.074 --> 43:12.992
Like I said, find Gil.

43:13.184 --> 43:17.135
Get his contact, take him off the street,
or feed him to me.

43:17.327 --> 43:19.858
Then, hopefully,
Van Beber will go to his great reward...

43:20.012 --> 43:22.045
...and I'll get back
to my goddamn doughnuts.

43:30.638 --> 43:33.591
- Blades.
- It's not cars. It's bodies.

43:37.274 --> 43:38.885
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.

43:39.077 --> 43:41.532
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.

43:41.685 --> 43:45.061
I mind. You're putting my life at risk
and those of everyone around you.

43:49.817 --> 43:51.544
Idiot!

43:54.305 --> 43:55.341
Hey, I'm back.

43:55.495 --> 43:58.256
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males...

43:58.410 --> 44:02.092
...all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?

44:02.246 --> 44:05.545
How many non-Whole Foods dinners
am I up to? I'm going to prison soon.

44:05.698 --> 44:08.077
Two of out of the three
have federal jackets.

44:08.230 --> 44:10.417
Happy Conners is a snitch?
That's hard to believe.

44:10.570 --> 44:14.061
Negative. It's Ed Mackie and
Dean Nickerson are the informants.

44:14.214 --> 44:16.209
- Which agency?
- FBI.

44:16.362 --> 44:19.584
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy
named Willie Van Beber. Know him?

44:19.738 --> 44:23.190
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.

44:23.344 --> 44:26.566
Very soon. This is his last hurrah.

44:26.758 --> 44:29.826
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber
the names of the informants.

44:30.018 --> 44:32.435
Who has access to the FBI
informant database?

44:32.588 --> 44:37.192
Anyone senior in this department or
in any other in the region, state or federal.

44:37.383 --> 44:39.225
Why is Gold on the list though?

44:39.378 --> 44:41.833
I'm sure there's more than a few
who wanna smoke Gold.

44:42.025 --> 44:44.672
I expect it's because
he put Van Beber on death row.

44:44.825 --> 44:48.277
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?

44:48.431 --> 44:50.809
No, we put this out there,
our leaky cop evaporates.

44:51.001 --> 44:52.075
True.

44:52.229 --> 44:55.758
Glass finds out I'm working this,
he'll have a coronary. I don't need that.

44:55.911 --> 44:58.366
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.

44:58.558 --> 45:01.128
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?

45:01.895 --> 45:04.619
- Come on! What are you doing?
- No.

45:04.772 --> 45:06.153
Come on! Dude!

45:15.858 --> 45:16.855
You coming?

45:25.716 --> 45:27.788
Five-0 in the house.

45:27.941 --> 45:29.092
Was that really necessary?

45:29.284 --> 45:31.931
I keep my love of food
and my professional life separate.

45:34.386 --> 45:36.611
- Fatty.
- Blades.

45:36.764 --> 45:38.912
Give me a slab to go with
the sauce on the side.

45:39.104 --> 45:41.214
I heard you paid off that jury.

45:41.367 --> 45:43.707
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.

45:43.861 --> 45:47.773
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.

45:49.154 --> 45:51.648
Along with my order,
I'll need an address on Gil Ott.

45:51.839 --> 45:53.911
I don't know no Gil.

45:54.563 --> 45:57.402
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.

45:57.555 --> 45:59.780
And I do know me a Bill.

46:04.153 --> 46:05.879
Theodore, assume for a moment...

46:06.032 --> 46:08.833
...most of the people in this place
are on parole, probation...

46:08.986 --> 46:10.789
...or otherwise in the system.

46:10.942 --> 46:15.853
How long would it take for me to find out
one of them is in possession of a gun...

46:16.006 --> 46:21.530
...resulting in their immediate
and protracted incarceration?

46:22.681 --> 46:24.599
You ain't even no police.

46:27.782 --> 46:31.158
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.

46:31.350 --> 46:34.649
Feel free to call me any time
within the next five minutes.

46:45.543 --> 46:46.809
Yeah.

46:49.034 --> 46:51.719
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.

46:51.949 --> 46:55.133
Most importantly, what does any of it
have to do with finding my car?

46:55.325 --> 46:57.665
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.

46:57.818 --> 46:59.698
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.

47:01.424 --> 47:02.651
Talk to me.

47:03.879 --> 47:05.605
Thanks, Fatty. I owe you.

47:07.024 --> 47:09.825
Hey. You can't just go and
do whatever you want in life, Blades.

47:10.016 --> 47:11.321
There are systems and rules.

47:11.512 --> 47:13.507
These systems and rules exist
for a reason.

47:13.661 --> 47:15.732
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.

47:15.885 --> 47:19.108
And not once have you just cut a corner,
just bent a little.

47:19.683 --> 47:21.946
You know what the United States
Supreme Court says?

47:22.138 --> 47:25.322
United States Supreme Court says
a prosecutor is a representative...

47:25.475 --> 47:28.889
...not of an ordinary party
to a controversy. No, sir.

47:29.081 --> 47:33.646
As a prosecutor,
I am the representative of our sovereignty...

47:33.799 --> 47:35.947
...whose obligation
to govern impartially...

47:36.101 --> 47:39.131
...is as compelling as its obligation
to govern at all.

47:39.323 --> 47:42.315
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective...

47:42.469 --> 47:46.650
...my solemn obligation
is not to win cases, but to do justice.

47:47.570 --> 47:50.562
I make one wrong move,
I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.

47:50.908 --> 47:54.168
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.201
It's very tiring to be around you.

48:04.717 --> 48:06.674
You just bought a slab of ribs.

48:06.827 --> 48:10.394
You kidding me? The last time I ate
at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.

48:10.586 --> 48:12.082
This place rocks.

48:12.274 --> 48:14.384
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?

48:14.537 --> 48:17.721
I'm feeling really lost. Can you try
and explain to me what's happening?

48:17.913 --> 48:19.447
Your car look anything like that?

48:20.560 --> 48:23.475
That's it. I don't believe this.

48:23.628 --> 48:24.741
That's it. That's my car.

48:24.894 --> 48:27.963
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?

48:28.155 --> 48:29.843
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.

48:29.996 --> 48:31.799
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.

48:31.953 --> 48:34.369
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.

48:34.523 --> 48:36.287
Give me the keys.

48:37.016 --> 48:39.202
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.

48:39.356 --> 48:41.658
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear...

48:41.849 --> 48:44.534
...on how important that car is
to my father. To me.

48:44.726 --> 48:47.565
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
- It's not.

48:47.757 --> 48:49.253
I need to find that car, Blades.

48:49.406 --> 48:52.935
My family is gone, my career is shit,
my mother's insane and my father's dying.

48:53.127 --> 48:55.927
The one thing I got half a chance of doing
is finding that car.

48:56.081 --> 48:59.456
And if you can't or won't help me,
then goddamn it, I will do it myself.

49:00.108 --> 49:02.295
Get off. Get off.

49:02.870 --> 49:05.172
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.

49:05.364 --> 49:09.775
Hello? I'm kidnapped. Here, here.

49:09.967 --> 49:12.422
This is why this country's
going in the toilet.

49:12.575 --> 49:14.608
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?

49:14.800 --> 49:17.600
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?

49:17.754 --> 49:20.976
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.

49:21.590 --> 49:22.971
I just saw him.

49:23.124 --> 49:26.078
Called from the trunk of his car
after you told me about the list.

49:26.231 --> 49:28.725
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk? What happened?

49:28.917 --> 49:30.298
A pro, for sure.

49:30.489 --> 49:32.791
You were right about Mackie,
he was working for us.

49:33.290 --> 49:36.550
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.

49:36.704 --> 49:38.890
Mackie would have put him down forever.

49:39.044 --> 49:40.923
I was actually figuring Happy
for the body.

49:41.077 --> 49:44.567
I don't think so. Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.

49:44.759 --> 49:47.214
- You know Willie Van Beber?
- 4-4 number-one shot caller?

49:47.406 --> 49:50.475
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.

49:50.628 --> 49:52.738
Van Beber's settling up
before he gets executed.

49:52.891 --> 49:54.924
They wanna kill each other,
it's fine with me.

49:55.078 --> 49:57.111
Start smoking my informants,
I get annoyed.

49:57.303 --> 50:00.487
I mean, Mackie means
we lose two ongoing investigations.

50:00.640 --> 50:03.018
He made the list
for putting Van Beber on the row.

50:03.172 --> 50:06.356
- How nice. Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.

50:06.547 --> 50:09.578
After you get your delivery boy,
plug the damn leak.

50:12.416 --> 50:14.871
We're not even looking for my car.
I doubt we ever were.

50:15.063 --> 50:17.633
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?

50:17.787 --> 50:19.897
These things take time. Have faith.

50:20.050 --> 50:22.774
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.

50:40.419 --> 50:42.759
I don't understand. Why are we waiting?

50:42.912 --> 50:45.904
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we
just go in and get Gil Ott now?

50:46.096 --> 50:47.631
Fools rush in, my friend.

50:51.006 --> 50:52.426
I hate golf.

50:55.341 --> 50:59.023
Other than working on the Hawk, this was
the one thing my father and I did together.

50:59.484 --> 51:02.476
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs
around people's necks.

51:02.974 --> 51:04.010
You just have to relax.

51:06.158 --> 51:07.117
How?

51:07.961 --> 51:11.068
Before you swing, breathe.

51:15.671 --> 51:18.548
Okay, time's up. I'll go get him.

51:19.853 --> 51:22.231
If Gil Ott's in there,
you think my car is nearby?

51:22.384 --> 51:25.146
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.

51:25.300 --> 51:30.018
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing. I'll be back.

51:59.823 --> 52:02.010
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil. How you been?

52:02.163 --> 52:04.887
Until about two seconds ago,
pretty good.

52:05.040 --> 52:08.224
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?

52:08.378 --> 52:10.526
- Out where?
- Jail.

52:10.679 --> 52:13.901
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.

52:14.093 --> 52:18.850
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead. Okay?

52:19.042 --> 52:21.919
Paper had the name of 4-4's,
two of which were federal snitches.

52:22.072 --> 52:24.719
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

52:24.949 --> 52:29.284
It also had the name of a DA named Theo
Gold, who also happens to be a friend.

52:29.437 --> 52:31.087
You get the needle for whacking a DA.

52:31.278 --> 52:33.733
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.

52:33.887 --> 52:35.805
You're the only one
who can ID the source...

52:35.958 --> 52:39.717
...which is why I assume you're whacked
out in this caddy shack shit hole.

52:39.871 --> 52:42.863
That's just rude. I live here.

52:43.131 --> 52:46.545
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.

52:55.253 --> 52:59.741
Everybody wants you, Gil. Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.

52:59.895 --> 53:03.155
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.649
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.

53:08.142 --> 53:09.830
Sit down.

53:09.983 --> 53:11.901
I need your contact. One name.

53:12.055 --> 53:15.123
Give me that name and maybe
I'll let you live so you can remodel.

53:15.315 --> 53:17.310
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.

53:20.033 --> 53:21.760
Back inside.

53:22.565 --> 53:24.023
Now!

53:47.039 --> 53:49.302
You want me to go after them
or get those off you?

53:49.455 --> 53:51.834
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.

53:51.987 --> 53:54.595
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.

53:55.746 --> 53:57.166
Did you ask about the car?

53:58.163 --> 53:59.275
I forgot.

54:00.503 --> 54:02.344
It's okay.

54:05.375 --> 54:06.794
I'm sorry I shot you.

54:07.599 --> 54:10.668
Nothing nine Band-Aids
and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.

54:11.550 --> 54:13.545
I did predict you'd shoot me.

54:13.737 --> 54:14.964
I remember.

54:15.118 --> 54:17.688
I decided I wanted to live
more than I want my car.

54:17.841 --> 54:19.644
My father will understand that.

54:19.798 --> 54:21.102
I'll take you home.

54:21.294 --> 54:23.173
Just drop me off at my parents'.

54:23.365 --> 54:24.976
I'll break the news.

54:25.168 --> 54:26.626
I can already see his face.

54:26.779 --> 54:29.503
God, I'd do anything to avoid
that slightly disappointed...

54:29.656 --> 54:32.150
...but not altogether surprised look.

54:32.533 --> 54:34.106
You know the look?

54:34.259 --> 54:35.640
Please.

54:35.794 --> 54:40.013
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old
daughter I see one weekend a month.

54:40.167 --> 54:41.931
I know the look.

54:45.269 --> 54:49.642
Theo, go get him before
one of the neighbors calls the police.

54:52.020 --> 54:53.439
Yeah.

54:53.708 --> 54:55.395
- Yep.
- What are you doing?

54:55.549 --> 54:56.815
Call you in a bit.

54:57.007 --> 54:58.925
I can't tell whether
I'm being guarded or surveilled.

54:59.116 --> 55:01.188
Your little redheaded
co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?

55:01.341 --> 55:04.717
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really? Why?

55:04.909 --> 55:06.712
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.

55:07.249 --> 55:10.394
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.

55:10.548 --> 55:13.233
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.

55:13.386 --> 55:16.455
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?

55:16.608 --> 55:20.022
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on. That's ridiculous.

55:20.176 --> 55:23.935
She can go to any private firm in this city
and make five times what she's making.

55:24.088 --> 55:27.157
She doesn't need to sell informant data
for money, okay?

55:27.311 --> 55:30.993
- You want me to call her? Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore. Maybe later.

55:31.147 --> 55:33.909
My mother wants you to come in
for my belated birthday dinner.

55:34.062 --> 55:37.975
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.

55:38.128 --> 55:42.655
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.

55:42.808 --> 55:46.222
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.

55:46.375 --> 55:48.485
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?

55:48.677 --> 55:52.935
Can you do the entire Valoise family a
favor and just stay off the subject? Please?

55:53.127 --> 55:56.848
Did you know that Robert Evans was
our neighbor for a while in California?

55:57.001 --> 55:59.379
Of course,
that was before he became huge.

56:00.569 --> 56:04.520
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.

56:04.711 --> 56:07.780
Apparently not so incredible
that he cast me in anything.

56:07.972 --> 56:10.427
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.

56:10.580 --> 56:13.035
Sonny and Cher. Bobby Redford.

56:13.189 --> 56:15.222
Bobby had a terrible overbite.

56:15.375 --> 56:17.639
Tell me again. Who are you?

56:17.792 --> 56:20.976
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.

56:21.513 --> 56:23.162
That is very interesting.

56:23.316 --> 56:25.234
Your son's a great lawyer.

56:25.387 --> 56:28.456
We would have preferred
if he had gone into dentistry...

56:28.648 --> 56:30.873
...but you give them wings,
they fly away.

56:31.026 --> 56:32.292
You know how it is, Marty.

56:35.054 --> 56:37.202
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.

56:37.355 --> 56:42.265
That was before anyone told me
about his, you know, style.

56:42.649 --> 56:45.526
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it? Thank you.

56:48.173 --> 56:51.587
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.

56:52.316 --> 56:54.349
I used to think I had one.

56:54.502 --> 56:56.804
Now I realize I burned it down
without even knowing.

56:57.456 --> 56:59.220
Homes get rebuilt.

56:59.911 --> 57:02.481
All I wanted was to spend
whatever time my dad has left...

57:03.363 --> 57:05.780
...driving around with him in the Hawk.

57:05.933 --> 57:08.772
- Pulling plugs. You know?
- And sending me to prison.

57:09.577 --> 57:11.572
I figured this is the time
to be a good son.

57:12.148 --> 57:14.372
After, I'd try to be a better
husband and father.

57:17.863 --> 57:19.589
Tell me about your daughter.

57:19.781 --> 57:21.661
She lives with her mom.

57:22.159 --> 57:26.149
All the money I skimmed from the
detective busts went toward her school.

57:26.341 --> 57:30.253
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.

57:32.440 --> 57:33.629
I feel horrible about it.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.120
You expect me to drop the case...

57:37.273 --> 57:40.035
...because you have the same problems
that everybody else does.

57:40.227 --> 57:42.874
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.

57:43.027 --> 57:45.981
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.

57:46.364 --> 57:48.704
People get divorced
and pay for braces all the time...

57:48.896 --> 57:51.811
- ...without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.

57:52.003 --> 57:53.346
They lack opportunity.

57:54.573 --> 57:55.993
Maybe.

57:56.146 --> 57:58.179
I mean, my wife's family has money.

57:58.371 --> 58:00.673
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.

58:01.478 --> 58:04.278
You still can't tell me
what we've been doing for the past day?

58:04.432 --> 58:05.698
For the moment, no.

58:05.889 --> 58:08.344
And the car is safely on its way
to Argentina.

58:11.106 --> 58:13.139
Bon voyage, old friend.

58:13.293 --> 58:17.858
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.

58:18.049 --> 58:20.811
Tomorrow, Again,
again and again and again.

58:20.965 --> 58:24.340
- It's a great movie.
- Yeah. She's not your mother.

58:24.494 --> 58:25.913
What's that about your mother?

58:26.105 --> 58:28.637
Theo was just telling me
that Lena's not my mother.

58:28.790 --> 58:30.478
You didn't know that?

58:38.533 --> 58:43.290
I told you, detective, my father dropped
me off at the hotel. I was alone.

58:43.482 --> 58:45.822
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.

58:46.014 --> 58:48.392
- I can't help it.
- Try.

58:48.545 --> 58:50.233
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.

58:50.387 --> 58:53.686
He was there with you. He used three
capital letters to sign for the drink.

58:53.877 --> 58:56.447
WMP. William McPherson.

58:56.639 --> 58:57.943
Why do you hate me?

58:58.097 --> 59:02.508
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson. People love me.

59:02.815 --> 59:08.185
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson. People love me.

59:09.029 --> 59:11.254
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.

59:11.408 --> 59:13.364
That scene kills me every time.

59:13.517 --> 59:15.512
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.

59:15.704 --> 59:17.353
- WVB?
- Yeah.

59:17.507 --> 59:19.770
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.

59:19.962 --> 59:21.995
Makes sense, but we figured
it came from him.

59:22.148 --> 59:23.606
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl...

59:23.798 --> 59:26.790
...and she says Gil snitched for her
in a possession case last year.

59:26.943 --> 59:28.670
So she felt like she owed him a favor.

59:29.015 --> 59:31.700
Gil gave her some story
about the hold being trumped up.

59:31.853 --> 59:34.232
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.

59:34.423 --> 59:36.188
Check and see
if Van Beber has any kids.

59:36.341 --> 59:38.681
Nick, what the heck
are you doing in there?

59:38.835 --> 59:41.213
- I gotta go. Just check.
- Okay.

59:49.115 --> 59:50.304
I'm sorry.

59:50.458 --> 59:51.839
Okay, that's it.

59:52.031 --> 59:54.601
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.

59:54.754 --> 59:58.130
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?

59:58.283 --> 01:00:00.738
You say you'll bring it back
and I nod like a robot?

01:00:00.892 --> 01:00:03.500
I'll take him. Just let me get this. Yo.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.224
Detective Blades? It's Rosalyn Wohl.

01:00:06.377 --> 01:00:07.988
- Yes?
- Who is that?

01:00:08.142 --> 01:00:09.561
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.

01:00:09.714 --> 01:00:11.479
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?

01:00:13.627 --> 01:00:16.657
He says he'll give you the guy
who's killing the people on the list.

01:00:16.811 --> 01:00:18.614
All right. Where?

01:00:18.959 --> 01:00:21.644
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.

01:00:21.836 --> 01:00:24.138
Just do what he says.

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:27.552
- What does Gil want?
- The list.

01:00:27.705 --> 01:00:29.278
- Why?
- If he gets the list back...

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:32.116
...his employer refrains
from putting a bullet in his ear.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.185
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.

01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:37.103
You don't have the list. Happy took it.

01:00:37.257 --> 01:00:40.095
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?

01:00:40.249 --> 01:00:43.893
You know all those bad people you sent
to prison? They ever call to say thanks?

01:00:44.085 --> 01:00:47.384
No. Sometimes I send people
to prison for doing bad things.

01:00:47.537 --> 01:00:50.069
Doesn't necessarily mean
they're bad people.

01:00:50.452 --> 01:00:52.178
I appreciate that.

01:00:52.332 --> 01:00:55.286
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?

01:00:55.477 --> 01:00:58.738
Apparently his last wish is for you
to precede him to the promised land.

01:00:58.891 --> 01:01:01.883
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo. Too dangerous.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:05.835
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?

01:01:05.988 --> 01:01:08.827
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.197
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car. Don't give me a gun.

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:16.729
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.186
- You trust me?
- I trust you.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.334
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.

01:01:20.488 --> 01:01:23.211
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.

01:01:36.637 --> 01:01:38.901
- Yeah.
- Happy. Blades.

01:01:39.054 --> 01:01:42.199
If you're not too busy making doughnuts
I could use some backup.

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:45.613
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?

01:01:45.767 --> 01:01:48.912
Well, technically,
I'm on administrative leave.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.498
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?

01:02:43.652 --> 01:02:45.838
- Gold, yes. Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.

01:02:45.992 --> 01:02:47.986
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.

01:02:48.907 --> 01:02:51.132
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.

01:02:51.324 --> 01:02:52.666
Let's go. Now. Come on.

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.891
You're staying with me.

01:03:11.999 --> 01:03:12.997
Hey, Blades.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:15.797
- Gil. How you been?
- Wonderful.

01:03:15.989 --> 01:03:17.408
Hands on your head.

01:03:18.137 --> 01:03:19.633
Hands.

01:03:21.704 --> 01:03:23.085
Come on.

01:03:25.464 --> 01:03:27.458
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?

01:03:27.612 --> 01:03:30.565
I don't know. Am I supposed to know?

01:03:36.243 --> 01:03:38.698
Oh, shit. Call 911 and stay with the car.

01:03:50.129 --> 01:03:53.083
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.

01:03:53.274 --> 01:03:54.732
I ran into your father, Gil.

01:03:54.924 --> 01:03:57.149
- He's worried about you.
- My father?

01:03:57.494 --> 01:04:00.563
That's funny. That's really--
That's hilarious.

01:04:00.716 --> 01:04:03.018
- Where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.

01:04:03.171 --> 01:04:04.782
Bullshit. Give me the goddamn paper.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.007
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.

01:04:07.698 --> 01:04:09.270
And you don't really need it anyway.

01:04:09.884 --> 01:04:11.342
Hands up on your head.

01:04:14.104 --> 01:04:16.827
I'm really sorry about
the way this ends, detective.

01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:19.474
I had such a good time
watching you in trial.

01:04:19.666 --> 01:04:21.776
You were the happiest defendant
I've ever seen.

01:04:21.967 --> 01:04:24.154
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.

01:04:26.033 --> 01:04:28.488
You know you were right.
About the list?

01:04:28.642 --> 01:04:31.826
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.

01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:35.125
You're not the first to say so,
although you may be the last.

01:04:35.317 --> 01:04:37.196
Thought that kidnapping thing
sounded fishy.

01:04:37.388 --> 01:04:39.958
I knew you'd respond
to a lady in distress.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.758
That's no way to treat an employee.

01:04:43.027 --> 01:04:44.254
Independent contractor.

01:04:44.945 --> 01:04:47.630
I thought I was doing you
a favor though, killing Gold.

01:04:47.822 --> 01:04:49.164
He wants to put you away.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.197
Once you know him,
his intentions are good.

01:04:51.351 --> 01:04:52.924
That's very magnanimous.

01:04:53.077 --> 01:04:54.381
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?

01:04:54.573 --> 01:04:58.217
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.

01:04:58.371 --> 01:05:00.979
So, yeah, sad story all around.

01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:04.470
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:06.656
Police!

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:10.991
A few of my dad's friends.

01:05:11.144 --> 01:05:13.523
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.

01:05:13.715 --> 01:05:15.172
Oh, shit.

01:06:12.405 --> 01:06:13.402
Blades.

01:06:13.556 --> 01:06:15.474
You could have
put my father away for life.

01:06:15.627 --> 01:06:18.005
Instead you had to kill him?

01:06:18.504 --> 01:06:22.839
- I'm sorry. I was just doing my job.
- No compromises. No deals.

01:06:22.992 --> 01:06:24.910
Right? Well, guess what.

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:26.751
No deal for you either.

01:06:27.135 --> 01:06:28.477
Don't move.

01:06:59.472 --> 01:07:02.311
Yeah, well,
Wohl was her mother's maiden name.

01:07:02.464 --> 01:07:03.960
Van Beber never married her.

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:09.446
I hate to admit it, Blades,
but you're not a half-bad detective.

01:07:11.977 --> 01:07:14.586
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.654
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath
the next 85 years.

01:07:17.808 --> 01:07:19.342
Are we still on for Whole Foods?

01:07:19.534 --> 01:07:22.181
You bet. Want a ride to work
in the morning?

01:07:22.411 --> 01:07:23.447
Sure.

01:07:25.173 --> 01:07:27.666
How very gallant of you.

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:31.617
Thanks.

01:07:46.539 --> 01:07:48.764
- It's tomorrow.
- Again.

01:07:48.918 --> 01:07:51.488
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.

01:07:51.679 --> 01:07:53.252
That is good.

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:58.239
- That's bad.
- That is bad.

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.908
Still going after my dad for adultery?

01:08:07.062 --> 01:08:09.095
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.

01:08:09.593 --> 01:08:12.739
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.

01:08:12.931 --> 01:08:15.808
It's a fantasy. He never cheated on her.

01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:18.992
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.

01:08:19.145 --> 01:08:22.175
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God. More fantasy.

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:24.937
Does my mother have any
actual evidence of this affair?

01:08:25.129 --> 01:08:27.814
Her theory is that he takes
his girl or girls...

01:08:29.118 --> 01:08:30.077
...to this hotel.

01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:33.415
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:39.015
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:43.005
It means I found the car.

01:08:43.196 --> 01:08:45.728
If the Hawk was supposed
to be on its way to Argentina...

01:08:45.881 --> 01:08:47.645
...why did it keep popping up
over town?

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.988
Excellent question.

01:08:49.142 --> 01:08:51.674
You wouldn't expect a thief
to steal it then tool around.

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:54.627
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.

01:08:54.819 --> 01:08:56.085
Except when driving the Hawk.

01:08:56.238 --> 01:08:58.962
He would never take a mistress
to a swank hotel.

01:08:59.116 --> 01:09:03.028
He would park the car in a hotel garage
if it meant keeping it off the street.

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:10.814
Yes!

01:09:10.969 --> 01:09:13.501
What do you say? I get a turn
at the wheel of this beauty?

01:09:13.692 --> 01:09:15.841
All right, you've earned it.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.600
You just go very easy, okay?

01:09:19.752 --> 01:09:22.515
She likes to be rewed a lot
before she downshifts.

01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:23.666
- Taser boy?
- Yes?

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:25.124
Relax.

01:09:25.277 --> 01:09:28.805
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.724
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:35.251
You have to convince 12 jurors,
including at least a few females.

01:09:37.897 --> 01:09:40.161
Yes. Yes.

01:09:48.907 --> 01:09:51.745
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!

01:09:57.307 --> 01:09:59.225
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?

01:09:59.379 --> 01:10:01.067
Letting you drive!

01:10:14.761 --> 01:10:16.717
Apologize to your father for me.

01:10:16.871 --> 01:10:21.359
Dad, I am really, really sorry.

01:10:54.156 --> 01:10:55.767
Is he dead?

01:10:56.535 --> 01:10:59.105
He never stood a chance
against the Hawk.

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:01.406
Who is he?

01:11:01.828 --> 01:11:04.322
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.774
I guess killing his daughter
didn't endear us to him.

01:11:09.539 --> 01:11:11.188
We got lucky.

01:11:12.147 --> 01:11:14.295
I've never been lucky.

01:11:26.263 --> 01:11:27.529
Thanks.

01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:29.409
For what?

01:11:29.831 --> 01:11:31.902
Keeping me alive.

01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:35.124
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.

01:11:36.582 --> 01:11:39.075
So speaking of you
sending me to prison....

01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:41.032
We were?

01:11:41.607 --> 01:11:44.331
Admittedly, I've had some lapses
of judgment.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:47.016
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:51.581
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses
here and there.

01:11:51.772 --> 01:11:53.690
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.

01:11:56.107 --> 01:11:58.984
Thanks for showing me
the forest and the grays.

01:12:01.324 --> 01:12:04.316
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.

01:12:06.349 --> 01:12:08.689
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?

01:12:08.843 --> 01:12:11.643
What am I gonna tell my dad?

01:12:12.218 --> 01:12:14.136
Tell him how much you love him.

01:12:15.133 --> 01:12:17.167
The rest is pretty much
paint by numbers.

01:12:45.553 --> 01:12:49.043
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.

01:13:14.399 --> 01:13:15.780
Son.

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:18.120
Hey. Dad.

01:13:19.578 --> 01:13:21.419
What time is it?

01:13:21.956 --> 01:13:23.375
I have some bad news.

01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:25.600
What? Where's mom?

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:29.206
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. Mom is fine.

01:13:29.398 --> 01:13:30.932
She's fine.

01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:36.264
Now, look, Theo. I don't want you
to overreact or anything...

01:13:36.418 --> 01:13:40.023
...but it appears as if
the Hawk has been stolen.

01:13:42.862 --> 01:13:44.435
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.

01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:46.583
I know how much it meant to you.

01:13:47.197 --> 01:13:48.501
Me?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.994
That car meant everything
in the world to you.

01:13:51.186 --> 01:13:53.564
Everything? No, no, no.

01:13:54.562 --> 01:13:56.978
It's a fine automobile...

01:13:58.206 --> 01:14:00.507
...but you know what I always say:

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:03.231
It's just a car.

01:14:05.072 --> 01:14:06.415
Yeah.

01:14:10.327 --> 01:14:11.363
I love you, Dad.

01:14:12.437 --> 01:14:14.394
I love you too, kiddo.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.611
We interviewed a few jurors
after the mistrial...

01:14:19.802 --> 01:14:22.219
...they seemed pretty unimpressed,
so we walked away.

01:14:22.372 --> 01:14:24.674
But the fact that you decided
to dismiss the case...

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:27.244
...doesn't mean
Detective Blades is innocent.

01:14:27.398 --> 01:14:31.157
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:32.960
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.

01:14:33.151 --> 01:14:35.415
I understand you spent time
with Detective Blades...

01:14:35.606 --> 01:14:38.292
...looking for your car,
which you reported stolen?

01:14:38.829 --> 01:14:41.859
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?

01:14:42.665 --> 01:14:44.468
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.

01:14:45.657 --> 01:14:49.109
Looks like you and Detective Blades
had quite an adventure.

01:14:50.989 --> 01:14:54.556
Detective Blades was instrumental
in uncovering a damaging leak...

01:14:54.748 --> 01:14:56.052
...that was in our office.

01:14:56.206 --> 01:14:59.198
A leak which had already resulted
in the death of an FBI informant.

01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:01.538
That's very impressive. Look...

01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:05.489
...you knew at the time that Detective
Blades was on administrative leave...

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.557
...and he had specific orders
not to do any police work.

01:15:08.749 --> 01:15:10.859
My mother hired him as a Pl
to look for the car.

01:15:11.012 --> 01:15:12.163
Which your father had.

01:15:13.429 --> 01:15:15.040
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

01:15:15.194 --> 01:15:17.303
I bet Detective Blades
went out of his way...

01:15:17.495 --> 01:15:19.490
...not to mislead anyone
about his status.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:22.329
He never flipped his badge, right?

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.825
Never brandished his gun?

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:28.082
Never once in your presence
identified himself as a police officer?

01:15:35.486 --> 01:15:37.250
Technically, no.

01:15:39.667 --> 01:15:41.240
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.

01:15:41.086 --> 01:15:45.881
