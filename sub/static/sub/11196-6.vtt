00:08.240 --> 00:10.200
Cassandra!

00:10.920 --> 00:13.400
I'm not imagining it.
She was here, was she not?

00:13.520 --> 00:15.920
Almost the entire time
she was opening presents.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.360
- Cassie!
- What?

00:20.920 --> 00:24.160
I thought you were wearing
the top that Sam bought you.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.440
OK.h. Well, that's, like, for school.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.720
- Hey. Make a wish.
- Yeah.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.640
- Dominic's waiting.
- Fine. Invite him in.

00:32.759 --> 00:36.960
I'm sure he'd love a piece of birthday cake
that Sam went to all the trouble to bake.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.360
- Buy.
- Bring.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.080
- I'd love to meet him.
- You said I could go.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.400
Yeah, I did. After.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.160
We're meeting a bunch of people.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.560
Considering you have not been feeling
well, you're lucky I'm letting you out at all.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.160
Fine.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.920
- You know, I could just...
- No.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.960
She is going to have a piece of birthday
cake. You stay right where you are.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.520
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.360
They're not letting me leave yet, so if you
wanna go and meet up with everybody...

01:22.480 --> 01:24.480
Wait a second. Here.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.160
Happy birthday.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

01:41.840 --> 01:46.320
- It's just like the ones from class.
- Yeah, well, you said it was pretty, so...

01:48.000 --> 01:52.880
This one's for decoration, though.
I thought you could put it in your room.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.320
- (Cassandra drops to ground)
- Cassandra?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.800
Help!

02:30.880 --> 02:33.600
- What happened?
- Nothing. She just fell.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.360
She has a temperature.
What was she doing when she "fell"?

02:37.480 --> 02:38.800
- I kissed her.
- Kissed her?!

02:38.920 --> 02:43.360
It's her birthday, all right? Look, the light
just exploded and she just passed out.

02:43.480 --> 02:47.520
I wanna get her to the infirmary.
Get the car keys. Cass? Baby? Cassie?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.760
Cassie.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.520
- How's she doing?
- Her fever still hasn't come down.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.399
Sam, I need to get a sample of your blood.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.400
Cassandra's blood work shows
the presence of a retrovirus.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.920
- Didn't she just get over the flu?
- Whatever this is, it isn't the flu.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.000
Is there a causal relationship
between the retrovirus and the EM field?

04:31.120 --> 04:33.080
Possibly.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.600
What?

04:34.680 --> 04:38.040
Cassandra's body is generating
a low-level electromagnetic field.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.880
It's been spiking. That could be
why the light exploded on the porch.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.520
And why I can't do an MRI to find out what
other effects this retrovirus is having.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.040
- Mom?
- I'm here.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.520
I couldn't finish the harvest.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.040
That's OK.K.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.480
I have to go into the forest.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.520
It's OK.K, Cassie.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.120
- Do I need to quarantine the base?
- I don't think it's contagious.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.280
Major Carter and I show
no evidence of the retrovirus.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.880
Then where did Cassandra contract it?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.720
- I'm guessing her home planet.
- She has not been there in several years.

05:30.840 --> 05:35.520
Retroviruses can exist in the body for
years before the first symptoms appear.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.760
When it emerges, it starts to rewrite
the individual's DNA in order to replicate.

05:39.880 --> 05:44.360
I've compared this with every retrovirus
on record. It doesn't match any of them.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.600
So there's obviously no vaccine.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.320
I've been giving her antiviral
medications, but her tests show

05:50.440 --> 05:53.320
that the virus is spreading
into her cerebrospinal fluid.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.760
At this moment, I'm more
concerned about brain damage.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.640
I just finished going through
SG-7's reports from P8X-987.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.440
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.840
OK.n Cassandra's planet, SG-7 witnessed
two incidents of fever and hallucination

06:08.920 --> 06:10.960
in teenagers Cassandra's age.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.840
The villagers called it the "mind fire".
I found some digital video footage.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.840
Hurry! This way! She's overhere!

06:21.080 --> 06:23.800
- What happened?
- We werejust walking along...

06:23.920 --> 06:27.960
Shejust dropped and started convulsing.
What's wrong with her?.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.040
- There's more, but you get the idea.
- How did they treat it?

06:39.320 --> 06:43.200
SG-7 offered medicine, but they believed
the children were touched by gods

06:43.280 --> 06:46.800
- and interfering would tempt retribution.
- What happened to 'em?

06:46.920 --> 06:52.280
They were sent alone to the forest nearby.
After several days they came back, cured.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.600
- How?
- SG-7 tried to find out,

06:54.680 --> 06:58.560
but the elders insisted the child
had to go alone as a religious rite.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.200
Cassandra talked about
going into the forest.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.240
- She was delirious.
- Well, it's worth checking out, sir.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.360
When we saw P8X-987, the atmosphere
was contaminated by the Goa'uld Nirrti.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.680
Well, that was four years ago.
The toxin could be nonpersistent.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.360
But we can send a MALP to be sure.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.760
Sir?

07:20.480 --> 07:22.800
It's worth a try.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.920
(Daniel) Here's something.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.720
It's a hand print.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.640
A fire burned here.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.440
Maybe we should collect
samples of local vegetation.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.880
There might be
a natural cure around here.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.440
Yeah. Let's collect some of that flora.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.000
Hello?

09:05.440 --> 09:07.400
Carter? Daniel?

09:10.480 --> 09:12.880
I believe we are in a Goa'uld laboratory.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.720
- Whose, do you think?
- Nirrti.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.720
Yeah.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.280
It's OK.K. It's just... It's us.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.320
- So where are we?
- I believe we're in the laboratory of Nirrti.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.520
Sir, if this is where
the children ended up...

09:44.640 --> 09:48.520
- You're right about that.
- She didn't finish her sentence.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.280
This place is what
the initiation rite was all about.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.960
Hankan children with the mind fever
wander alone into the forest. It gets dark.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.720
They're drawn to the hand print
on the tree, then to the warm fire.

10:01.840 --> 10:06.120
- Then the rings sweep them to this lab.
- And then they come back cured.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.840
- Nirrti cured 'em?
- Yeah. It makes sense.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.400
- No, it doesn't.
- Indeed. It seems a plausible explanation.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.120
No. She killed everyone
on this planet except Cassie.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.400
Why would she cure a bunch of kids?

10:18.520 --> 10:21.480
If I'm reading this right,
it was part of some experiment.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.720
Now, see, that sounds like a Goa'uld.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.560
Nirrti was a prisoner of the System Lords.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.440
Which means she's in no position
to help us, even if she would.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.680
OK.h, boy.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.680
I did that.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.120
Let's take it with us.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.760
Cassie?

11:10.640 --> 11:13.440
- Cassandra, what are you doing?
- I have to go.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.800
- You're not well.
- I have to go to the forest.

11:15.920 --> 11:19.440
- I need you to get back into bed, OK.K?
- You're not my mother.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.120
Then what have I been to you
these past few years?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.200
- You don't understand.
- Listen to me.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.880
If nothing else, I am your doctor. Let's go.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.560
So what?

11:29.080 --> 11:33.960
I care about what happens to you. Honey,
don't you know what you mean to me?

11:34.080 --> 11:37.600
- Don't you get it? It doesn't matter!
- It's all that matters.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.760
- Please, let me try and help you.
- You can't.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.440
- If you wanna help me, then let me go!
- OK.K. Just hear me out.

11:45.640 --> 11:50.080
Let's get you back into bed,
and then we'll talk, OK.K?

11:50.360 --> 11:53.560
- SG-1 will be back soon. Then...
- No! Leave me alone!

11:53.680 --> 11:56.040
Cassie!

11:57.120 --> 12:00.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.560
- I can't do that!
- You're killing me!

12:09.840 --> 12:11.800
(alarm)

12:19.480 --> 12:22.520
- Major.
- Colonel OK.'Neill wanted me to report.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.760
Daniel and Teal'c wanted
more time to search the lab.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.320
- Let's hope they find something.
- Is she getting worse?

12:32.440 --> 12:34.400
You should see for yourself.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.680
We had to move her in here.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.760
- Is she still running a fever?
- It seems to have peaked.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.120
But her blood work says otherwise.

12:52.240 --> 12:57.240
There's no antibodies. No indication her
body's fighting this. Just more retrovirus.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.080
- Does she know what's happening?
- She seems driven to go to the planet.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.560
I don't know if that's instinctual
or a side effect of this retrovirus.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.440
What are we gonna tell her?

13:17.280 --> 13:20.080
Hey. How are you feeling? Any better?

13:21.920 --> 13:24.200
Why are you keeping me in here?

13:24.320 --> 13:28.440
We have to. Your body is generating
something called an EM field.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.200
You can see the effect
it's having on the monitors.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.280
So this room is shielded
from the rest of the base.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.000
If you let me go back to the planet,
then that won't happen any more.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.200
- That's not true.
- You don't know that.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.160
You don't know anything. You're just
keeping me here because you're afraid.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.640
We found the place where the initiation
rite was supposed to happen.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.680
Then let me go there.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.920
We think the place you feel drawn to
led to a Goa'uld laboratory.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.880
- OK.ne that belonged to Nirrti.
- She killed everyone in my village.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.840
- Yeah.
- She also tried to use you to kill us.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.520
We think she used your initiation ritual to
experiment on the children of your planet.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.880
- Why?
- We don't know.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.160
It's possible the retrovirus you're
carrying was part of her experiment.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.920
What was the experiment?

14:19.360 --> 14:21.760
All we know so far
is that this retrovirus

14:21.880 --> 14:25.440
is changing the way your cells
generate electrical fields.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
So your body's generating heat, and your
EEG shows your brain activity increasing.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.080
You don't know why, do you?

14:38.400 --> 14:39.880
No.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.720
- And now she's gone.
- Yes, she is.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.600
So... you won't be able to stop it.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.840
We didn't say that.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.120
What's this for?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.200
What do you think it is for?

15:12.600 --> 15:15.560
- (Daniel) "Evolution..."
- What?

15:16.080 --> 15:19.800
"of the Hok'tar... Hok'tar..."
Teal'c, what's Hok'tar?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.560
I have not heard that word in many years.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.600
It refers to children
that underwent the initiation rite,

15:25.680 --> 15:29.120
so it obviously has something
to do with the children...

15:35.360 --> 15:37.480
Hello?

15:38.840 --> 15:41.240
Sorry, guys.
I think I may have just done that.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.560
Do it again. It's time to go.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.560
Hey, kiddo.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.040
- It's Saturday.
- So?

16:19.960 --> 16:23.760
So, every other Saturday, at least
while I'm on Earth, we play chess.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.000
And since I'm on Earth and it's Saturday...

16:27.120 --> 16:29.080
I know what's happening to me.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.000
OK.h. OK.K. What?

16:33.640 --> 16:36.080
I'm changing... into something.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.960
And there's nothing you can do to stop it.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.600
You know how me and your mom feel
when someone issues a challenge.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.840
Dr Fraiser isn't my real mother.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.280
She died when Nirrti poisoned my village.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.160
I know that. Janet knows that too.

16:57.240 --> 17:01.200
- And please, don't call her Dr Fraiser.
- Why?

17:01.760 --> 17:05.160
Because she loves you
and she deserves better.

17:05.280 --> 17:10.280
- We all love you, for that matter.
- That doesn't change anything.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.079
You're wrong about that.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.960
It's different now.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.640
I'm different now.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.720
I can do things.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.600
- How did you do that?
- I just...

17:35.160 --> 17:37.120
thought it.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.800
I thought I wanted a knight
and it flew into my hand.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.600
Jack calls 'em horses.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.040
Yeah, well, that's Colonel OK.'Neill for you.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.240
He always pretends
he's not as smart as he really is.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.120
You know, if you take a close look,
they really are horses.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.400
What do you see
when you look at me now?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.080
I see you.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.600
Until your head starts spinning
around, and probably even then,

18:12.720 --> 18:15.120
I will still see you.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.960
How can she do that?

18:38.120 --> 18:40.080
Magnets.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.720
Magnets. Each of those pieces
has a tiny magnet in the bottom

18:43.840 --> 18:48.760
to hold it on the board, like when
you're driving, so they don't rattle off.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.760
Anyway, every one of those magnets
has a little electrical field around it.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.800
That's how she was able
to manipulate 'em. Magnets.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.640
They do look like horses.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.840
I have no idea how she was able
to do it physiologically, sir.

19:07.920 --> 19:11.480
Actually, Teal'c filled me in
on something that might explain that.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.760
"Hok'tar" is a hybrid
of two Goa'uld words.

19:13.880 --> 19:18.520
"Hok", which means advanced, and
"tar", which I believe is a sort of slang.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.800
- For...?
- Human.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.400
So, essentially,
it's "advanced human". "Hok Tauri."

19:25.920 --> 19:28.040
Nirrti studied the children of Hanka

19:28.160 --> 19:30.960
because she believed
they were evolving into Hok'tar.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.680
You're saying Cassandra is becoming
some form of advanced human.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.520
And the retrovirus is the catalyst.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.560
An advanced human would be
a powerful host for the Goa'uld.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.040
Which explains why Nirrti
was experimenting.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.200
Also why she exterminated
the population when we came.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.800
She didn't want her experiment exposed.

19:49.880 --> 19:54.480
Prior to our arrival on P8X-987,
and for as long as SG-7 was there,

19:54.600 --> 19:59.040
no villager showed advanced intelligence
or the ability to manipulate EM fields.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.000
So Nirrti created the retrovirus
in an attempt to engineer her own host.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.680
It seems inconceivable
anybody could do that.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.560
It never worked.
According to all the reports,

20:09.640 --> 20:12.680
the children went into the forest sick
and came out well.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.720
If this was a transformation
or evolutionary process,

20:15.800 --> 20:17.800
at some point it was stopped.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.040
By Nirrti.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.720
Why would she do that?

20:22.840 --> 20:24.960
The retrovirus rewrites DNA.

20:25.080 --> 20:30.960
If the carrier died before they passed on
the altered genes, no evolution.

20:31.080 --> 20:35.560
- So the experiment was long term.
- With each generation closer to a Hok'tar.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.160
So how far along is Cassandra?

20:38.280 --> 20:43.000
What if maybe she really is
transforming into something else?

20:43.120 --> 20:47.640
- She thinks so.
- Whatever she thinks, her fever is rising.

20:47.760 --> 20:52.040
Admittedly more slowly, and she seems
to be able to handle it better, but...

20:52.120 --> 20:54.320
I can't control it.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.920
Let's find the answers.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.440
Dismissed.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.240
Cassandra?

21:12.360 --> 21:14.680
What are you doing?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.200
It helps, to do this.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.800
How?

21:18.920 --> 21:23.760
It's almost like the heat is leaving
my body and going into the chess piece.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.360
You haven't found a cure, have you?

21:30.520 --> 21:33.240
- No. We're still trying.
- It's all right.

21:35.360 --> 21:40.720
No, it's not. We may still learn something
from the biosamples SG-1 brought back.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.520
They might help your body
produce antibodies.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.880
I want this to happen, Janet.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.400
- Don't say that.
- It's going to happen anyway.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.360
- You're ill.
- You know that it's more than that now.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.560
I can feel a power inside me.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.600
It's only the beginning.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.280
And your body is undergoing
an enormous physical strain.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.000
- You think it's gonna kill me?
- I am worried about that possibility, yes.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.840
- I don't care.
- Well, you should.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.440
- I know the limits of the human body.
- Maybe I'm not human any more.

22:11.560 --> 22:15.000
- OK.f course you are.
- Dying may be part of the transformation.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.400
I don't care whether it is or not!

22:23.880 --> 22:25.840
- I'm sorry.
- (sighs)

22:30.680 --> 22:34.360
Sweetheart, sometimes
when a person is sick,

22:34.480 --> 22:36.840
it's important for them to fight.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.920
I want you to fight this. OK.K?

23:05.280 --> 23:07.720
That can't be right.
The EM field is interfering.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.400
No. She'll be able to control that now.

23:10.480 --> 23:15.600
I ran the test three times. The results were
consistent, and it agrees with the EEG.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.680
That's a 25 per cent higher
level of activity than normal.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.240
- How can her body sustain that?
- She can channel the heat from her body.

23:25.360 --> 23:29.400
Don't ask me how. But I don't know how
long she's gonna be able to keep it up.

23:29.520 --> 23:34.040
What I'd like her to do is sleep.
She's been awake for 30 hours straight.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.960
- I was about to go and see her.
- Thank you.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.360
Hey.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.640
I hear you don't wanna sleep.
You want some company?

24:14.760 --> 24:16.640
You wouldn't leave.

24:18.920 --> 24:23.400
When the Goa'uld planted the bomb
inside me, you wouldn't leave.

24:23.520 --> 24:28.520
Even though your orders were to
leave me there alone, you stayed with me.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.520
- Yeah.
- Why?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.120
I don't know. Just an instinct.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.640
- That I was gonna be OK.K?
- Yeah, I think so.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.200
But you didn't know for sure.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.160
No.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.760
Well...

24:49.400 --> 24:52.880
that's how I feel about
what's happening to me now.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.200
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I think I do.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.200
- Want me to stay with you for a while?
- It's not time yet.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.840
Don't say that.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.600
Well, when it is... time,

25:13.080 --> 25:15.520
will you be here?

25:16.600 --> 25:19.040
I promise.

25:20.400 --> 25:24.160
I think I can sleep now, for a little while.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.560
OK.K.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.240
- Sam?
- I think she's asleep.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.880
Good. Listen. The bodies of the villagers -
what happened to them?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.160
They were cremated.
We sent a team back.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.240
So there could be a bone fragment.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.880
If we find one from someone who's been
through the initiation, antibodies may...

27:58.000 --> 28:01.040
- That was four years ago. The chances...
- (alarm)

28:04.240 --> 28:06.200
OK.h, no.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.880
Cassandra?

28:12.720 --> 28:14.600
- It was a Goa'uld.
- What?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.800
I was asleep. I thought it was a nurse.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.440
- But I did sense its presence.
- I haven't sensed anything.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.760
It was after you left. At first no one was
there. When it got closer, I saw someone.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.760
This is a code three alert. We need zats
and TERs in isolation room four - now.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.960
- Are you all right?
- It ran away when I screamed.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.920
- Major?
- It appears there's a Goa'uld on the base.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.400
- What?
- How is that possible?

28:46.520 --> 28:49.400
Nirrti possesses the technology
to become invisible.

28:49.480 --> 28:53.120
Cronus is dead. If he was
the System Lord holding her prisoner...

28:53.240 --> 28:54.880
So she's out.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.040
The rings. It was her.
She came through the Stargate with us.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.560
She was waiting for us
in her lab the whole time.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.800
We may have inadvertently triggered
a device alerting her to our presence.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.600
Go level by level. Check everything.
Keep in radio contact.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.080
If you locate her, do not shoot to kill.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.320
- Colonel?
- I'm stayin' here, sir.

29:19.080 --> 29:23.680
I figure, you fought her off the first time,
I'm safer here with you.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.880
She was here the whole time
you've been back.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.040
- We'll find her.
- No, she's right.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.280
Why did she wait until now
to come after Cassandra?

29:41.640 --> 29:43.600
Level 22 is clear.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.440
- (Teal'c) Level 21, clear.
- Roger that.

30:01.520 --> 30:05.200
- She wanted to check on her experiment.
- We don't know what she wants.

30:05.320 --> 30:09.920
No. If the transformation were going to
kill me, she would've just let it happen.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.760
- Don't you see?
- Honey, not now.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.360
- No, but it did work.
- Cassandra.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.200
No.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.040
Look out!

30:36.280 --> 30:38.240
Easy! We need her alive.

30:45.720 --> 30:49.680
Security to iso room four.
All search teams stand down.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.080
Cassie? Cassie, don't do this.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.840
Please get her outta here.

30:56.760 --> 31:00.560
Come on, let's move! Roll her over. Easy.

31:18.560 --> 31:22.320
- What's gonna happen to Cassandra?
- (distorted) What is her condition?

31:22.440 --> 31:25.000
She just lost consciousness.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.240
Then the end is very near.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.920
If she dies... so do you.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.680
And what do you offer in return?

31:36.120 --> 31:38.560
I don't think you're
in any position to bargain.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.560
I am in the position to save the life
of a child you hold dear.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.560
- Release me.
- We can't do that.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.800
General...

31:53.200 --> 31:56.160
With my invisibility device intact.

31:58.080 --> 32:01.640
I also require a sample of her blood.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.760
Absolutely not.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.520
Those are my terms.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.640
- She says she can help Cassandra.
- If we trust her.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.720
No, if we let her go.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.320
Do you believe that she can actually help?

32:24.440 --> 32:28.560
Seeing as how we don't have a choice,
I guess it's worth a shot.

32:28.640 --> 32:33.000
- What is General Hammond going to do?
- He hasn't decided yet.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.440
I really need to get back
and see Cassandra.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.840
We all know how tough this has been
for you, so if you need anything...

32:45.880 --> 32:47.840
Thanks.

33:02.720 --> 33:06.360
All right. Give me
70 milligrams of dantrolene.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.440
- Doctor?
- Now!

33:12.800 --> 33:14.760
- Mom?
- I'm here.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.280
We're just giving you something else
to try and get your fever down.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.360
It's happening.

33:21.920 --> 33:27.360
OK.K. I want you to do what we talked
about, OK.K? I want you to fight this.

33:27.480 --> 33:30.520
- I don't wanna fight it.
- You have to.

33:30.640 --> 33:35.840
Honey, your body's not gonna be able to
survive what this retrovirus is trying to do.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.800
- Where's Sam?
- She's gone to try to get Nirrti to help.

33:43.120 --> 33:47.080
No. Let it happen. Let it happen!

33:47.160 --> 33:49.720
- (groans)
- Drop ten of Valium.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.200
(nurse) Valium's in.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.600
(DrFraiser cries out)

34:03.720 --> 34:05.680
Temperature's 106.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.800
The dantrolene is not working?

34:21.560 --> 34:26.000
General, with all due respect, it's not
like we're negotiating with terrorists.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.480
It's exactly that. You're letting
your emotions get in the way.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.960
- Yes, I am. Shouldn't you be?
- Jack...

34:34.040 --> 34:37.000
Until yesterday we didn't know
Nirrti was still alive.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.040
Exactly.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.800
Who cares if we let her go?

34:41.880 --> 34:46.000
What difference does it make?
It's just one more Goa'uld runnin' around.

34:46.120 --> 34:49.920
If we were to allow Nirrti to leave
with a sample of Cassandra's blood,

34:50.040 --> 34:56.000
she could well create an advanced host
and become dangerously powerful.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.080
- I agree with General Hammond.
- What?

34:59.200 --> 35:01.600
The life of a child may be sacrificed,

35:01.720 --> 35:06.760
but Nirrti possesses valuable information
that would be lost if we let her leave.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.920
General Hammond would like me
to check in on her.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.680
Argh!

35:32.120 --> 35:35.880
- Teal'c, we're talking about Cassandra.
- OK.f that I am aware.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.040
But her sacrifice would benefit
both of our peoples.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.400
Nirrti has information
that could help us defeat the Goa'uld.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.080
We'll find another way.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.440
We may never have a Goa'uld
as our prisoner again.

35:50.520 --> 35:54.160
Sir, you know what Cassandra has
gone through because of the Goa'uld.

35:54.280 --> 35:57.240
If we're gonna put
what might happen over her life...

35:57.360 --> 35:59.840
It's time to pack it in.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.640
I agree.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.520
(intercom) General Hammond
to the holding room.

36:19.240 --> 36:24.360
- Dr Fraiser, stand down.
- I can't do that, sir. I don't have a choice.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.000
Janet, don't do this.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.720
I can't help Cassandra. She can.

36:31.120 --> 36:35.880
SG-1 has convinced me to make a deal
for Cassandra's life. This isn't necessary.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.240
Then you agree to my terms.

36:39.840 --> 36:44.480
Just one. OK.nce you've cured Cassandra
of her illness, you'll be free to go.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.640
- And how do I know you will honour this?
- You have only my word.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.240
Not enough.

36:54.720 --> 36:59.520
Then I should remind you that the woman
holding the gun is Cassandra's mother.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.640
You have waited too long.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.880
You try again.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.640
- It is done.
- (Carter) Vital signs returning to normal.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.960
- Mom?
- It's OK.K. I'm here.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.000
I have honoured my part.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.440
Let's go to the gate.

39:30.480 --> 39:35.600
We've never dialled these coordinates. I...
sort of hope you know what you're doin'.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.360
It is not my final destination.

39:38.480 --> 39:43.600
Without a sample of her blood,
I will have to begin my experiment again.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.360
Aw, nuts.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.760
At least you have honoured
this much of our bargain.

39:51.440 --> 39:55.200
In your place, I doubt
I would have done the same.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.640
I'll keep that thought alive.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.160
Hey, Janet. How's our patient?

40:39.280 --> 40:40.840
Bored.

40:40.920 --> 40:44.400
The homework stacked up a bit,
but other than that she's just fine.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.160
- I get to take her home tonight.
- Ah... Dominic awaits.

40:49.560 --> 40:52.200
- Stop it.
- Come on. That last kiss was impressive.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.120
- Stop it!
- Lights exploded overhead.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.120
Stop it!

40:58.120 --> 40:59.680
- It's Saturday.
- OK.K.

40:59.800 --> 41:04.000
But... I won't be able to move the piece
around by thinking about it. Sorry.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.680
Good. Then we're even.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.520
Visiontext Subtitles: Doreen Trenerry

00:08.240 --> 00:10.200
Cassandra!

00:10.920 --> 00:13.400
I'm not imagining it.
She was here, was she not?

00:13.520 --> 00:15.920
Almost the entire time
she was opening presents.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.360
- Cassie!
- What?

00:20.920 --> 00:24.160
I thought you were wearing
the top that Sam bought you.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.440
Oh. Well, that's, like, for school.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.720
- Hey. Make a wish.
- Yeah.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.640
- Dominic's waiting.
- Fine. Invite him in.

00:32.759 --> 00:36.960
I'm sure he'd love a piece of birthday cake
that Sam went to all the trouble to bake.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.360
- Buy.
- Bring.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.080
- I'd love to meet him.
- You said I could go.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.400
Yeah, I did. After.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.160
We're meeting a bunch of people.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.560
Considering you have not been feeling
well, you're lucky I'm letting you out at all.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.160
Fine.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.920
- You know, I could just...
- No.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.960
She is going to have a piece of birthday
cake. You stay right where you are.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.520
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.360
They're not letting me leave yet, so if you
wanna go and meet up with everybody...

01:22.480 --> 01:24.480
Wait a second. Here.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.160
Happy birthday.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.320
- It's just like the ones from class.
- Yeah, well, you said it was pretty, so...

01:48.000 --> 01:52.880
This one's for decoration, though.
I thought you could put it in your room.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.320
- (Cassandra drops to ground)
- Cassandra?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.800
Help!

02:30.880 --> 02:33.600
- What happened?
- Nothing. She just fell.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.360
She has a temperature.
What was she doing when she "fell"?

02:37.480 --> 02:38.800
- I kissed her.
- Kissed her?!

02:38.920 --> 02:43.360
It's her birthday, all right? Look, the light
just exploded and she just passed out.

02:43.480 --> 02:47.520
I wanna get her to the infirmary.
Get the car keys. Cass? Baby? Cassie?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.760
Cassie.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.520
- How's she doing?
- Her fever still hasn't come down.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.399
Sam, I need to get a sample of your blood.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.400
Cassandra's blood work shows
the presence of a retrovirus.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.920
- Didn't she just get over the flu?
- Whatever this is, it isn't the flu.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.000
Is there a causal relationship
between the retrovirus and the EM field?

04:31.120 --> 04:33.080
Possibly.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.600
What?

04:34.680 --> 04:38.040
Cassandra's body is generating
a low-level electromagnetic field.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.880
It's been spiking. That could be
why the light exploded on the porch.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.520
And why I can't do an MRI to find out what
other effects this retrovirus is having.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.040
- Mom?
- I'm here.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.520
I couldn't finish the harvest.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.040
That's OK.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.480
I have to go into the forest.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.520
It's OK, Cassie.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.120
- Do I need to quarantine the base?
- I don't think it's contagious.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.280
Major Carter and I show
no evidence of the retrovirus.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.880
Then where did Cassandra contract it?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.720
- I'm guessing her home planet.
- She has not been there in several years.

05:30.840 --> 05:35.520
Retroviruses can exist in the body for
years before the first symptoms appear.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.760
When it emerges, it starts to rewrite
the individual's DNA in order to replicate.

05:39.880 --> 05:44.360
I've compared this with every retrovirus
on record. It doesn't match any of them.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.600
So there's obviously no vaccine.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.320
I've been giving her antiviral
medications, but her tests show

05:50.440 --> 05:53.320
that the virus is spreading
into her cerebrospinal fluid.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.760
At this moment, I'm more
concerned about brain damage.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.640
I just finished going through
SG-7's reports from P8X-987.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.440
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.840
On Cassandra's planet, SG-7 witnessed
two incidents of fever and hallucination

06:08.920 --> 06:10.960
in teenagers Cassandra's age.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.840
The villagers called it the "mind fire".
I found some digital video footage.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.840
Hurry! This way! She's overhere!

06:21.080 --> 06:23.800
- What happened?
- We werejust walking along...

06:23.920 --> 06:27.960
Shejust dropped and started convulsing.
What's wrong with her?.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.040
- There's more, but you get the idea.
- How did they treat it?

06:39.320 --> 06:43.200
SG-7 offered medicine, but they believed
the children were touched by gods

06:43.280 --> 06:46.800
- and interfering would tempt retribution.
- What happened to 'em?

06:46.920 --> 06:52.280
They were sent alone to the forest nearby.
After several days they came back, cured.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.600
- How?
- SG-7 tried to find out,

06:54.680 --> 06:58.560
but the elders insisted the child
had to go alone as a religious rite.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.200
Cassandra talked about
going into the forest.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.240
- She was delirious.
- Well, it's worth checking out, sir.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.360
When we saw P8X-987, the atmosphere
was contaminated by the Goa'uld Nirrti.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.680
Well, that was four years ago.
The toxin could be nonpersistent.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.360
But we can send a MALP to be sure.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.760
Sir?

07:20.480 --> 07:22.800
It's worth a try.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.920
(Daniel) Here's something.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.720
It's a hand print.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.640
A fire burned here.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.440
Maybe we should collect
samples of local vegetation.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.880
There might be
a natural cure around here.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.440
Yeah. Let's collect some of that flora.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.000
Hello?

09:05.440 --> 09:07.400
Carter? Daniel?

09:10.480 --> 09:12.880
I believe we are in a Goa'uld laboratory.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.720
- Whose, do you think?
- Nirrti.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.720
Yeah.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.280
It's OK. It's just... It's us.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.320
- So where are we?
- I believe we're in the laboratory of Nirrti.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.520
Sir, if this is where
the children ended up...

09:44.640 --> 09:48.520
- You're right about that.
- She didn't finish her sentence.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.280
This place is what
the initiation rite was all about.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.960
Hankan children with the mind fever
wander alone into the forest. It gets dark.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.720
They're drawn to the hand print
on the tree, then to the warm fire.

10:01.840 --> 10:06.120
- Then the rings sweep them to this lab.
- And then they come back cured.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.840
- Nirrti cured 'em?
- Yeah. It makes sense.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.400
- No, it doesn't.
- Indeed. It seems a plausible explanation.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.120
No. She killed everyone
on this planet except Cassie.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.400
Why would she cure a bunch of kids?

10:18.520 --> 10:21.480
If I'm reading this right,
it was part of some experiment.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.720
Now, see, that sounds like a Goa'uld.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.560
Nirrti was a prisoner of the System Lords.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.440
Which means she's in no position
to help us, even if she would.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.680
Oh, boy.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.680
I did that.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.120
Let's take it with us.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.760
Cassie?

11:10.640 --> 11:13.440
- Cassandra, what are you doing?
- I have to go.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.800
- You're not well.
- I have to go to the forest.

11:15.920 --> 11:19.440
- I need you to get back into bed, OK?
- You're not my mother.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.120
Then what have I been to you
these past few years?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.200
- You don't understand.
- Listen to me.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.880
If nothing else, I am your doctor. Let's go.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.560
So what?

11:29.080 --> 11:33.960
I care about what happens to you. Honey,
don't you know what you mean to me?

11:34.080 --> 11:37.600
- Don't you get it? It doesn't matter!
- It's all that matters.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.760
- Please, let me try and help you.
- You can't.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.440
- If you wanna help me, then let me go!
- OK. Just hear me out.

11:45.640 --> 11:50.080
Let's get you back into bed,
and then we'll talk, OK?

11:50.360 --> 11:53.560
- SG-1 will be back soon. Then...
- No! Leave me alone!

11:53.680 --> 11:56.040
Cassie!

11:57.120 --> 12:00.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.560
- I can't do that!
- You're killing me!

12:09.840 --> 12:11.800
(alarm)

12:19.480 --> 12:22.520
- Major.
- Colonel O'Neill wanted me to report.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.760
Daniel and Teal'c wanted
more time to search the lab.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.320
- Let's hope they find something.
- Is she getting worse?

12:32.440 --> 12:34.400
You should see for yourself.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.680
We had to move her in here.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.760
- Is she still running a fever?
- It seems to have peaked.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.120
But her blood work says otherwise.

12:52.240 --> 12:57.240
There's no antibodies. No indication her
body's fighting this. Just more retrovirus.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.080
- Does she know what's happening?
- She seems driven to go to the planet.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.560
I don't know if that's instinctual
or a side effect of this retrovirus.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.440
What are we gonna tell her?

13:17.280 --> 13:20.080
Hey. How are you feeling? Any better?

13:21.920 --> 13:24.200
Why are you keeping me in here?

13:24.320 --> 13:28.440
We have to. Your body is generating
something called an EM field.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.200
You can see the effect
it's having on the monitors.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.280
So this room is shielded
from the rest of the base.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.000
If you let me go back to the planet,
then that won't happen any more.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.200
- That's not true.
- You don't know that.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.160
You don't know anything. You're just
keeping me here because you're afraid.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.640
We found the place where the initiation
rite was supposed to happen.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.680
Then let me go there.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.920
We think the place you feel drawn to
led to a Goa'uld laboratory.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.880
- One that belonged to Nirrti.
- She killed everyone in my village.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.840
- Yeah.
- She also tried to use you to kill us.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.520
We think she used your initiation ritual to
experiment on the children of your planet.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.880
- Why?
- We don't know.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.160
It's possible the retrovirus you're
carrying was part of her experiment.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.920
What was the experiment?

14:19.360 --> 14:21.760
All we know so far
is that this retrovirus

14:21.880 --> 14:25.440
is changing the way your cells
generate electrical fields.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
So your body's generating heat, and your
EEG shows your brain activity increasing.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.080
You don't know why, do you?

14:38.400 --> 14:39.880
No.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.720
- And now she's gone.
- Yes, she is.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.600
So... you won't be able to stop it.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.840
We didn't say that.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.120
What's this for?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.200
What do you think it is for?

15:12.600 --> 15:15.560
- (Daniel) "Evolution..."
- What?

15:16.080 --> 15:19.800
"of the Hok'tar... Hok'tar..."
Teal'c, what's Hok'tar?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.560
I have not heard that word in many years.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.600
It refers to children
that underwent the initiation rite,

15:25.680 --> 15:29.120
so it obviously has something
to do with the children...

15:35.360 --> 15:37.480
Hello?

15:38.840 --> 15:41.240
Sorry, guys.
I think I may have just done that.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.560
Do it again. It's time to go.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.560
Hey, kiddo.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.040
- It's Saturday.
- So?

16:19.960 --> 16:23.760
So, every other Saturday, at least
while I'm on Earth, we play chess.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.000
And since I'm on Earth and it's Saturday...

16:27.120 --> 16:29.080
I know what's happening to me.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.000
Oh. OK. What?

16:33.640 --> 16:36.080
I'm changing... into something.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.960
And there's nothing you can do to stop it.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.600
You know how me and your mom feel
when someone issues a challenge.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.840
Dr Fraiser isn't my real mother.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.280
She died when Nirrti poisoned my village.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.160
I know that. Janet knows that too.

16:57.240 --> 17:01.200
- And please, don't call her Dr Fraiser.
- Why?

17:01.760 --> 17:05.160
Because she loves you
and she deserves better.

17:05.280 --> 17:10.280
- We all love you, for that matter.
- That doesn't change anything.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.079
You're wrong about that.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.960
It's different now.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.640
I'm different now.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.720
I can do things.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.600
- How did you do that?
- I just...

17:35.160 --> 17:37.120
thought it.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.800
I thought I wanted a knight
and it flew into my hand.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.600
Jack calls 'em horses.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.040
Yeah, well, that's Colonel O'Neill for you.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.240
He always pretends
he's not as smart as he really is.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.120
You know, if you take a close look,
they really are horses.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.400
What do you see
when you look at me now?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.080
I see you.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.600
Until your head starts spinning
around, and probably even then,

18:12.720 --> 18:15.120
I will still see you.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.960
How can she do that?

18:38.120 --> 18:40.080
Magnets.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.720
Magnets. Each of those pieces
has a tiny magnet in the bottom

18:43.840 --> 18:48.760
to hold it on the board, like when
you're driving, so they don't rattle off.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.760
Anyway, every one of those magnets
has a little electrical field around it.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.800
That's how she was able
to manipulate 'em. Magnets.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.640
They do look like horses.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.840
I have no idea how she was able
to do it physiologically, sir.

19:07.920 --> 19:11.480
Actually, Teal'c filled me in
on something that might explain that.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.760
"Hok'tar" is a hybrid
of two Goa'uld words.

19:13.880 --> 19:18.520
"Hok", which means advanced, and
"tar", which I believe is a sort of slang.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.800
- For...?
- Human.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.400
So, essentially,
it's "advanced human". "Hok Tauri."

19:25.920 --> 19:28.040
Nirrti studied the children of Hanka

19:28.160 --> 19:30.960
because she believed
they were evolving into Hok'tar.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.680
You're saying Cassandra is becoming
some form of advanced human.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.520
And the retrovirus is the catalyst.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.560
An advanced human would be
a powerful host for the Goa'uld.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.040
Which explains why Nirrti
was experimenting.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.200
Also why she exterminated
the population when we came.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.800
She didn't want her experiment exposed.

19:49.880 --> 19:54.480
Prior to our arrival on P8X-987,
and for as long as SG-7 was there,

19:54.600 --> 19:59.040
no villager showed advanced intelligence
or the ability to manipulate EM fields.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.000
So Nirrti created the retrovirus
in an attempt to engineer her own host.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.680
It seems inconceivable
anybody could do that.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.560
It never worked.
According to all the reports,

20:09.640 --> 20:12.680
the children went into the forest sick
and came out well.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.720
If this was a transformation
or evolutionary process,

20:15.800 --> 20:17.800
at some point it was stopped.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.040
By Nirrti.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.720
Why would she do that?

20:22.840 --> 20:24.960
The retrovirus rewrites DNA.

20:25.080 --> 20:30.960
If the carrier died before they passed on
the altered genes, no evolution.

20:31.080 --> 20:35.560
- So the experiment was long term.
- With each generation closer to a Hok'tar.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.160
So how far along is Cassandra?

20:38.280 --> 20:43.000
What if maybe she really is
transforming into something else?

20:43.120 --> 20:47.640
- She thinks so.
- Whatever she thinks, her fever is rising.

20:47.760 --> 20:52.040
Admittedly more slowly, and she seems
to be able to handle it better, but...

20:52.120 --> 20:54.320
I can't control it.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.920
Let's find the answers.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.440
Dismissed.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.240
Cassandra?

21:12.360 --> 21:14.680
What are you doing?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.200
It helps, to do this.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.800
How?

21:18.920 --> 21:23.760
It's almost like the heat is leaving
my body and going into the chess piece.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.360
You haven't found a cure, have you?

21:30.520 --> 21:33.240
- No. We're still trying.
- It's all right.

21:35.360 --> 21:40.720
No, it's not. We may still learn something
from the biosamples SG-1 brought back.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.520
They might help your body
produce antibodies.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.880
I want this to happen, Janet.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.400
- Don't say that.
- It's going to happen anyway.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.360
- You're ill.
- You know that it's more than that now.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.560
I can feel a power inside me.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.600
It's only the beginning.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.280
And your body is undergoing
an enormous physical strain.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.000
- You think it's gonna kill me?
- I am worried about that possibility, yes.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.840
- I don't care.
- Well, you should.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.440
- I know the limits of the human body.
- Maybe I'm not human any more.

22:11.560 --> 22:15.000
- Of course you are.
- Dying may be part of the transformation.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.400
I don't care whether it is or not!

22:23.880 --> 22:25.840
- I'm sorry.
- (sighs)

22:30.680 --> 22:34.360
Sweetheart, sometimes
when a person is sick,

22:34.480 --> 22:36.840
it's important for them to fight.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.920
I want you to fight this. OK?

23:05.280 --> 23:07.720
That can't be right.
The EM field is interfering.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.400
No. She'll be able to control that now.

23:10.480 --> 23:15.600
I ran the test three times. The results were
consistent, and it agrees with the EEG.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.680
That's a 25 per cent higher
level of activity than normal.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.240
- How can her body sustain that?
- She can channel the heat from her body.

23:25.360 --> 23:29.400
Don't ask me how. But I don't know how
long she's gonna be able to keep it up.

23:29.520 --> 23:34.040
What I'd like her to do is sleep.
She's been awake for 30 hours straight.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.960
- I was about to go and see her.
- Thank you.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.360
Hey.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.640
I hear you don't wanna sleep.
You want some company?

24:14.760 --> 24:16.640
You wouldn't leave.

24:18.920 --> 24:23.400
When the Goa'uld planted the bomb
inside me, you wouldn't leave.

24:23.520 --> 24:28.520
Even though your orders were to
leave me there alone, you stayed with me.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.520
- Yeah.
- Why?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.120
I don't know. Just an instinct.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.640
- That I was gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I think so.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.200
But you didn't know for sure.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.160
No.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.760
Well...

24:49.400 --> 24:52.880
that's how I feel about
what's happening to me now.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.200
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I think I do.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.200
- Want me to stay with you for a while?
- It's not time yet.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.840
Don't say that.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.600
Well, when it is... time,

25:13.080 --> 25:15.520
will you be here?

25:16.600 --> 25:19.040
I promise.

25:20.400 --> 25:24.160
I think I can sleep now, for a little while.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.560
OK.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.240
- Sam?
- I think she's asleep.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.880
Good. Listen. The bodies of the villagers -
what happened to them?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.160
They were cremated.
We sent a team back.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.240
So there could be a bone fragment.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.880
If we find one from someone who's been
through the initiation, antibodies may...

27:58.000 --> 28:01.040
- That was four years ago. The chances...
- (alarm)

28:04.240 --> 28:06.200
Oh, no.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.880
Cassandra?

28:12.720 --> 28:14.600
- It was a Goa'uld.
- What?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.800
I was asleep. I thought it was a nurse.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.440
- But I did sense its presence.
- I haven't sensed anything.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.760
It was after you left. At first no one was
there. When it got closer, I saw someone.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.760
This is a code three alert. We need zats
and TERs in isolation room four - now.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.960
- Are you all right?
- It ran away when I screamed.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.920
- Major?
- It appears there's a Goa'uld on the base.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.400
- What?
- How is that possible?

28:46.520 --> 28:49.400
Nirrti possesses the technology
to become invisible.

28:49.480 --> 28:53.120
Cronus is dead. If he was
the System Lord holding her prisoner...

28:53.240 --> 28:54.880
So she's out.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.040
The rings. It was her.
She came through the Stargate with us.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.560
She was waiting for us
in her lab the whole time.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.800
We may have inadvertently triggered
a device alerting her to our presence.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.600
Go level by level. Check everything.
Keep in radio contact.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.080
If you locate her, do not shoot to kill.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.320
- Colonel?
- I'm stayin' here, sir.

29:19.080 --> 29:23.680
I figure, you fought her off the first time,
I'm safer here with you.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.880
She was here the whole time
you've been back.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.040
- We'll find her.
- No, she's right.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.280
Why did she wait until now
to come after Cassandra?

29:41.640 --> 29:43.600
Level 22 is clear.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.440
- (Teal'c) Level 21, clear.
- Roger that.

30:01.520 --> 30:05.200
- She wanted to check on her experiment.
- We don't know what she wants.

30:05.320 --> 30:09.920
No. If the transformation were going to
kill me, she would've just let it happen.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.760
- Don't you see?
- Honey, not now.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.360
- No, but it did work.
- Cassandra.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.200
No.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.040
Look out!

30:36.280 --> 30:38.240
Easy! We need her alive.

30:45.720 --> 30:49.680
Security to iso room four.
All search teams stand down.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.080
Cassie? Cassie, don't do this.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.840
Please get her outta here.

30:56.760 --> 31:00.560
Come on, let's move! Roll her over. Easy.

31:18.560 --> 31:22.320
- What's gonna happen to Cassandra?
- (distorted) What is her condition?

31:22.440 --> 31:25.000
She just lost consciousness.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.240
Then the end is very near.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.920
If she dies... so do you.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.680
And what do you offer in return?

31:36.120 --> 31:38.560
I don't think you're
in any position to bargain.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.560
I am in the position to save the life
of a child you hold dear.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.560
- Release me.
- We can't do that.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.800
General...

31:53.200 --> 31:56.160
With my invisibility device intact.

31:58.080 --> 32:01.640
I also require a sample of her blood.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.760
Absolutely not.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.520
Those are my terms.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.640
- She says she can help Cassandra.
- If we trust her.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.720
No, if we let her go.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.320
Do you believe that she can actually help?

32:24.440 --> 32:28.560
Seeing as how we don't have a choice,
I guess it's worth a shot.

32:28.640 --> 32:33.000
- What is General Hammond going to do?
- He hasn't decided yet.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.440
I really need to get back
and see Cassandra.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.840
We all know how tough this has been
for you, so if you need anything...

32:45.880 --> 32:47.840
Thanks.

33:02.720 --> 33:06.360
All right. Give me
70 milligrams of dantrolene.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.440
- Doctor?
- Now!

33:12.800 --> 33:14.760
- Mom?
- I'm here.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.280
We're just giving you something else
to try and get your fever down.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.360
It's happening.

33:21.920 --> 33:27.360
OK. I want you to do what we talked
about, OK? I want you to fight this.

33:27.480 --> 33:30.520
- I don't wanna fight it.
- You have to.

33:30.640 --> 33:35.840
Honey, your body's not gonna be able to
survive what this retrovirus is trying to do.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.800
- Where's Sam?
- She's gone to try to get Nirrti to help.

33:43.120 --> 33:47.080
No. Let it happen. Let it happen!

33:47.160 --> 33:49.720
- (groans)
- Drop ten of Valium.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.200
(nurse) Valium's in.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.600
(DrFraiser cries out)

34:03.720 --> 34:05.680
Temperature's 106.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.800
The dantrolene is not working?

34:21.560 --> 34:26.000
General, with all due respect, it's not
like we're negotiating with terrorists.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.480
It's exactly that. You're letting
your emotions get in the way.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.960
- Yes, I am. Shouldn't you be?
- Jack...

34:34.040 --> 34:37.000
Until yesterday we didn't know
Nirrti was still alive.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.040
Exactly.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.800
Who cares if we let her go?

34:41.880 --> 34:46.000
What difference does it make?
It's just one more Goa'uld runnin' around.

34:46.120 --> 34:49.920
If we were to allow Nirrti to leave
with a sample of Cassandra's blood,

34:50.040 --> 34:56.000
she could well create an advanced host
and become dangerously powerful.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.080
- I agree with General Hammond.
- What?

34:59.200 --> 35:01.600
The life of a child may be sacrificed,

35:01.720 --> 35:06.760
but Nirrti possesses valuable information
that would be lost if we let her leave.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.920
General Hammond would like me
to check in on her.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.680
Argh!

35:32.120 --> 35:35.880
- Teal'c, we're talking about Cassandra.
- Of that I am aware.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.040
But her sacrifice would benefit
both of our peoples.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.400
Nirrti has information
that could help us defeat the Goa'uld.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.080
We'll find another way.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.440
We may never have a Goa'uld
as our prisoner again.

35:50.520 --> 35:54.160
Sir, you know what Cassandra has
gone through because of the Goa'uld.

35:54.280 --> 35:57.240
If we're gonna put
what might happen over her life...

35:57.360 --> 35:59.840
It's time to pack it in.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.640
I agree.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.520
(intercom) General Hammond
to the holding room.

36:19.240 --> 36:24.360
- Dr Fraiser, stand down.
- I can't do that, sir. I don't have a choice.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.000
Janet, don't do this.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.720
I can't help Cassandra. She can.

36:31.120 --> 36:35.880
SG-1 has convinced me to make a deal
for Cassandra's life. This isn't necessary.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.240
Then you agree to my terms.

36:39.840 --> 36:44.480
Just one. Once you've cured Cassandra
of her illness, you'll be free to go.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.640
- And how do I know you will honour this?
- You have only my word.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.240
Not enough.

36:54.720 --> 36:59.520
Then I should remind you that the woman
holding the gun is Cassandra's mother.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.640
You have waited too long.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.880
You try again.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.640
- It is done.
- (Carter) Vital signs returning to normal.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.960
- Mom?
- It's OK. I'm here.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.000
I have honoured my part.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.440
Let's go to the gate.

39:30.480 --> 39:35.600
We've never dialled these coordinates. I...
sort of hope you know what you're doin'.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.360
It is not my final destination.

39:38.480 --> 39:43.600
Without a sample of her blood,
I will have to begin my experiment again.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.360
Aw, nuts.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.760
At least you have honoured
this much of our bargain.

39:51.440 --> 39:55.200
In your place, I doubt
I would have done the same.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.640
I'll keep that thought alive.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.160
Hey, Janet. How's our patient?

40:39.280 --> 40:40.840
Bored.

40:40.920 --> 40:44.400
The homework stacked up a bit,
but other than that she's just fine.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.160
- I get to take her home tonight.
- Ah... Dominic awaits.

40:49.560 --> 40:52.200
- Stop it.
- Come on. That last kiss was impressive.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.120
- Stop it!
- Lights exploded overhead.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.120
Stop it!

40:58.120 --> 40:59.680
