WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.233
Now, this is Baby Shaw
at three weeks.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.933
See, she just
a little tiny dot.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.366
Now, over at six weeks,
she's the size of a lima bean.

00:09.433 --> 00:11.666
Alright, and this one
was taken yesterday.

00:11.733 --> 00:13.666
She looks just like mommy,
doesn't she?

00:16.833 --> 00:19.266
Yeah, if mommy's a sea horse.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.866
W‐w‐w‐whoa, hold on.
W‐what's that right there?

00:21.933 --> 00:26.500
Oh, that's my profile
of Sperm Donor 432.

00:26.566 --> 00:28.300
My man in a can.

00:29.933 --> 00:31.833
Wait a minute,
you‐you‐you got your seed

00:31.900 --> 00:33.300
from the Turner Institute?

00:34.533 --> 00:37.033
Whoa, small world.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.466
Wait a minute, Overton.

00:38.533 --> 00:39.866
Are you trying to tell me
that your swimmers

00:39.933 --> 00:41.866
are doing laps
in somebody else's pool?

00:43.733 --> 00:46.200
No, baby, not me. Kyle.

00:46.266 --> 00:47.700
See, couple of years back
he had one of those

00:47.766 --> 00:49.000
near‐death experiences

00:49.066 --> 00:51.300
while bicycling
through the Lincoln Tunnel.

00:51.366 --> 00:54.000
So, he decided to make
a deposit at that there bank

00:54.066 --> 00:56.500
to guarantee
that the Barker bloodline

00:56.566 --> 00:58.633
would flow
into the next millennium.

01:02.273 --> 01:05.373
No, no, no.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.073
Donor 432 is not Kyle Barker.

01:08.140 --> 01:11.473
Check out my fine
specimen's profile.

was the freaking internet.

01:47.473 --> 01:50.240
"Oh, my."
What are you oh‐mying about?

01:51.773 --> 01:54.406

to appreciate intelligence

01:57.606 --> 01:59.973
plus, have a sense of adventure

[sobbing]
Why? Why? W‐why, why?

03:13.753 --> 03:15.120
You know,
this little sea horse

03:15.186 --> 03:17.120
does kinda have
Kyle's cheekbones.

Maxine. Oh, my God.

03:21.886 --> 03:23.653
What is Kyle gonna say
when you tell him

03:23.720 --> 03:25.353
he seeded your garden?

03:25.420 --> 03:27.953
No! I'm not telling him.

03:28.020 --> 03:30.786
He gave up his right to know
when he dropped that magazine

03:30.853 --> 03:33.453
zipped up his pants,
and walked outta that place.

03:35.686 --> 03:37.453
She didn't mean that.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.620
Well, even if she did

03:40.686 --> 03:43.286
I mean, this is not a secret
any of us can keep.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.420
You know what I'm saying?

03:44.486 --> 03:47.120
I mean, not to be Reginesque,
but, uh..

03:47.186 --> 03:48.620
Somebody got to tell Kyle.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.053
Yeah, well, um,
you know, he is in Ohio

03:51.120 --> 03:52.786
visiting the folks
for the holidays.

03:52.853 --> 03:55.486
I, I could call him up
and tell him to come up here

03:55.553 --> 03:57.886
for the New Year's Eve
party tonight.

03:57.953 --> 03:59.586
And then, maybe, we can get Max

03:59.653 --> 04:02.760
to spill the beans,
about them beans.

04:05.093 --> 04:07.793
How come I wasn't invited
to the New Year's Eve party?

04:09.426 --> 04:12.193
Um, that's 'cause
I just thought of it, baby.

04:14.326 --> 04:16.826
Overton, you're a sly one. Okay.

04:16.892 --> 04:18.826
'Good plan, good plan.
Good plan, good plan.'

04:20.260 --> 04:21.826
Mmm.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.360
Greetings, boss lady.

04:23.426 --> 04:26.460
Came to drop off my special
rum punch for tonight's party.

04:28.226 --> 04:32.160
Yo, Russ, the‐the party's
not for another eight hours.

04:32.226 --> 04:34.026
Well, uh, I'm afraid
I can't be trusted

04:34.093 --> 04:35.726
with this potent concoction.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.459
Last year, I dipped into it
a little early.

04:39.526 --> 04:42.493
By four in the afternoon,
I was naked in Times Square..

04:44.626 --> 04:47.126
...begging a policeman
for a ride on his horse.

04:54.126 --> 04:57.193
Wow. She just beat
Max's record to the kitchen.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.026
This must be big.

05:10.066 --> 05:12.000
My marriage is over.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.366
Since lunch?

05:17.666 --> 05:19.900
You know that TV show
I auditioned for?

05:19.966 --> 05:22.533
They offered me
the role of the renegade nun.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
Hey.

05:23.666 --> 05:26.400
No! Hello, divorce court. Eww.

05:28.966 --> 05:31.766
Synclaire,
you see this look on my face?

05:31.833 --> 05:33.900
Okay, it's called confusion.
Help me.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.266
Don't you see?

05:36.333 --> 05:38.000
They film the show in Hollywood.

05:38.066 --> 05:39.666
That means Overton and I
will have to move.

05:39.733 --> 05:40.900
He's not gonna wanna do that.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.766
He has his job,
he has his friends.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.833
Besides,
think of all the sunscreen

05:44.900 --> 05:46.366
we're gonna need for his dome.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.866
Synclaire, you're buggin'.
Come on, now.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.866
Overton married you,
hairy toes and all!

05:55.633 --> 05:58.133
Hey, that's a man who'll
follow you anywhere, okay?

05:58.200 --> 06:01.440
Well, damn him! Damn him!

06:01.506 --> 06:03.806
Why does he have to be
so understanding?

06:03.873 --> 06:05.106
Why can't he just say

06:05.173 --> 06:07.106
"We're stayin' here, woman,
so cool your jets."

06:08.740 --> 06:10.606
Because nobody's talked
like that since the 50s.

06:11.740 --> 06:12.973
Alright, now,
let's get to the real.

06:14.506 --> 06:17.140
Khadijah, when I moved here
from Minnesota

06:17.206 --> 06:19.173
you were just my cousin.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.440
Now, you're my dearest friend.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.940
What am I gonna do
if I can't drop by

06:23.006 --> 06:25.773
and soak up all of your love
and understanding

06:25.840 --> 06:28.773
and constructive,
most of the time, criticism?

06:29.940 --> 06:31.906
Oh, I just don't want
this to be over.

06:32.673 --> 06:35.206
Oh, neither do I.

06:35.273 --> 06:38.506
Look, when you first came here
you could barely load a stapler.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.973
Now, look at you!

06:42.040 --> 06:44.706
Synclaire James‐Jones.

06:44.773 --> 06:47.373

Wife and actress..

06:47.440 --> 06:49.806
‐ Whoo‐whoo‐whooah!
‐ That's me.

06:49.873 --> 06:52.040
Come on, now,
there's nothing you can't do.

06:53.306 --> 06:56.640
Oh, Khadijah. Oh, Khadijah!

06:59.240 --> 07:00.446
That's my cuz..

07:01.380 --> 07:03.180
Um, ladies and gentlemen

07:03.246 --> 07:06.580
back from his, uh, show stopping
engagement in London, England.

07:06.646 --> 07:09.313
Please give it up
for Mr. Kyle Barker.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.313
[Khadijah whooping]

07:13.913 --> 07:15.313
Oh, baby.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.280
Oh, welcome home.

07:17.346 --> 07:19.246
‐ Thank you, boo.
‐ Oh, I've missed you.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.546
Damn, you look good.
Have you lost weight?

07:21.613 --> 07:23.646
Yeah. Well, have you
tried English food?

07:26.080 --> 07:27.280
Yo, shawty. Uh..

07:27.346 --> 07:28.680
‐ ...you remember Trip, right?
‐ What's up, man?

07:28.746 --> 07:29.946
‐ How you doing?
‐ Hey, man. Lookin' good.

07:30.013 --> 07:32.646
Yeah, and that right there
is, uh, Rawr Roni.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.546
'The girl who, uh,
subletted your apartment.'

07:34.613 --> 07:35.546
‐ Oh, okay.
‐ Nice to meet you.

07:35.613 --> 07:36.746
‐ Nice to meet you too.
‐ You know..

07:36.813 --> 07:38.080
I've been wanting to ask you
about all these

07:38.146 --> 07:39.646
little cheese puff stashes

07:39.713 --> 07:41.413
I keep finding
all over the bedroom.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.180
‐ Ah, I had a pet named Maxine.
‐ Oh.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.446
Ooh‐hoo..

07:46.513 --> 07:47.813
‐ You ain't right..
‐ Yeah, everybody.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.280
You know, um, we got plenty
of time for mixing later.

07:50.346 --> 07:51.746
Right now,
I gotta show you my new pad.

07:51.813 --> 07:55.813
Man, I did some installation
that's a festival for the eyes.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.713
Uh‐huh, And me
without my camera. Later, boo.

07:58.780 --> 08:01.053
‐ Ah. So good to see you.
‐ Ah, boo. Oh, you too.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.086
‐ Come on, dawg.
‐ Oh..

08:02.153 --> 08:03.420
Oh, boy.

08:03.486 --> 08:04.553
[Max gasps]

08:04.620 --> 08:08.686
Oh, Maxine.
I see you found Mr. Right.

08:11.486 --> 08:13.020
Kyle, what are you doing here?

08:13.086 --> 08:16.086
Oh, the Brits
didn't want you either, huh?

08:16.153 --> 08:17.920
Actually, Overton called me
in Cleveland

08:17.986 --> 08:19.786
and invited me
to tonight's festivities.

08:19.853 --> 08:24.286
Oh, how convenient.
Suddenly there are festivities.

08:24.353 --> 08:27.120
Yeah, to, uh,
ring in all things new

08:27.186 --> 08:29.520
and soon to be new..

08:31.186 --> 08:33.253
Talk amongst yourselves. Mmm.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.352
So, how goes
life of the maverick?

08:37.419 --> 08:39.720
Great! Um, let me see.

08:39.785 --> 08:42.253
Hmph. I'm pregnant.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.920
Pregnant?

08:45.986 --> 08:47.920
[laughs]

08:49.486 --> 08:50.886
With what?

08:52.653 --> 08:54.553
What do you think,
I'm incapable of producing life?

08:54.620 --> 08:56.920
No, no, no.
It's just that, um..

08:56.986 --> 09:00.453
[chuckles]
I never pictured you
as the motherly type is all.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.960
Hmm. And all that time I spent
trying to make you a man.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.860
Well, then, who did you seduce,
and where is the body buried?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.393
Not deep enough.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.226
Anyway, uh, he's not
part of my life anymore, so..

09:16.960 --> 09:18.193
Look, look, Max

09:18.260 --> 09:20.493
if there is anything you need,
anything I can do‐‐

09:20.560 --> 09:23.393
Nah, trust me, Kyle, I have
everything I need from you

09:23.460 --> 09:26.260
and a few things
I didn't ask for, eh?

09:26.326 --> 09:28.660
Alright, Walter,
come on, <i>schnell.</i>

09:28.726 --> 09:30.660
Oh, come on. <i>Schnell.</i>

09:32.126 --> 09:33.393
Schnell didn't work on me.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.393
I don't know what makes
you think it'll work on him.

09:37.993 --> 09:39.226
[knock on door]

09:41.060 --> 09:44.693
Hey, hey. So how'd your little
tete‐a‐tete with Max go, huh?

09:44.760 --> 09:45.693
Oh, enlightening.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.860
She finally found someone

09:46.926 --> 09:48.860
she can lead around on a leash.

09:50.426 --> 09:53.093
Well, did she tell you about
the new additions to her life?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.860
Uh, the, uh,
project she is developing.

09:55.926 --> 09:58.426
The, uh, uh,
precious cargo, uh..

09:58.493 --> 09:59.933
You mean, the baby?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.633
Phew, thanks, bro, uh..

10:01.700 --> 10:04.100
Running out
of colorful euphemisms.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.066
So, c'mon,
how you holding up man?

10:06.133 --> 10:08.900
I'm fine, man.
It's her choice, you know.

10:08.966 --> 10:10.466
My ties with Maxine Shaw

10:10.533 --> 10:12.466
were cut at that
airport terminal, bro.

10:12.533 --> 10:14.566
W‐w‐wait a minute,
now, what about the baby?

10:14.633 --> 10:16.566
I mean, it is half yours.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.766
Overton, man,
I've been gone for five months.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.800
Now, I know I'm virile
and all, you know.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.133
But I doubt even if my sperm
could swim across the Atlantic.

10:32.133 --> 10:34.666
Good lord,
that girl didn't tell you.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.100
Tell me what?

10:36.166 --> 10:38.666
Um, bro..

10:38.733 --> 10:42.733
Uh, Max was, uh, inseminated
at the Turner Institute

10:42.800 --> 10:46.366
and, uh, her donor of choice

10:46.433 --> 10:50.166
would be, um,
Big Wave Barker.

11:01.773 --> 11:04.706
[screaming]

11:11.706 --> 11:14.540
Hey, bro, can I get you
like a real drink, man?

11:14.606 --> 11:17.073
Rat poison is my drink
of choice at the moment.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.406
Look, Overton..

11:20.473 --> 11:23.606
Do you know
the odds of Maxine picking me

11:23.673 --> 11:26.640
out of thousands of donors?
Let's see.

11:26.706 --> 11:29.940
One in six hundred
and fifty five million, man.

11:30.006 --> 11:31.740
Shawty,
that's your problem, man.

11:31.806 --> 11:33.606
You live in this cold,
sterile universe

11:33.673 --> 11:35.806

and balance sheets.

11:35.873 --> 11:38.573
But in the real world
with living human beings

11:38.640 --> 11:39.606

11:39.673 --> 11:41.506
W‐well, well‐well‐well,
look here.

11:41.573 --> 11:43.506
It happened,
you gotta deal with it.

11:44.373 --> 11:45.740
How?

11:45.806 --> 11:50.006
Right at this moment,
my child, a Barker..

11:50.073 --> 11:53.706
...is trapped inside
the body of Maxine Shaw.

11:55.306 --> 11:56.806
Being nurtured by nachos

11:56.873 --> 11:59.813
and snack cakes
and sides of beef.

12:01.746 --> 12:03.780
My child is gestating
in a landfill.

12:05.580 --> 12:08.546
Well, um,
easy target as Maxine is

12:08.613 --> 12:10.913
you look me in the eye
and tell me you're over her.

12:12.146 --> 12:16.213
No. No, see, see,
my life has never been better.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.380
I'm this close
to making partner.

12:19.446 --> 12:22.246
I just got a gig singing
in a jazz club in Chelsea

12:22.313 --> 12:24.580
and I don't mean to brag

12:24.646 --> 12:26.246
but the Brits are
caught up in a little thing

12:26.313 --> 12:28.746
they are calling Barker mania.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.946
Yeah, so, um, how's
your love life, Jazz Man?

12:34.013 --> 12:36.780
It's never been better.
I am dating a supermodel.

12:36.846 --> 12:40.113
Six foot one and girly
is well worth the climb.

12:42.580 --> 12:45.680
Tell me, how many times you
close your eyes and you see Max?

12:50.813 --> 12:53.113
I'm afraid to close my eyes,
man.

12:55.646 --> 12:57.046
Dear God

12:57.113 --> 13:01.453
why can't I exorcise this demon?

13:04.586 --> 13:06.120
[sobs]

13:06.186 --> 13:09.620
That's because of a little thing
we Joneses like to call destiny.

13:10.586 --> 13:12.653
And it never goes away.

enough, God, I‐I get it."

13:20.820 --> 13:24.353
Overton, I've been flat on
my ass since I met this woman.

13:24.420 --> 13:27.353
Tell me, when are her knees
going to buckle, huh?

13:28.953 --> 13:31.586
Well, hopefully,
before her water breaks.

13:33.353 --> 13:34.520
Kyle, look here, man.

13:34.586 --> 13:36.653
This child gonna
link you two together

13:36.720 --> 13:38.886
for the rest of your lives, man.

13:38.953 --> 13:40.986
Maybe it's time y'all
stopped acting like opponents

13:41.053 --> 13:43.086
and start acting like parents.

13:45.753 --> 13:47.453
‐ Wow.
‐ Hey.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.853
What do you think
of baby's first snowman?

13:51.620 --> 13:55.020
Well, I think baby's lucky,
that baby can't see it.

13:56.186 --> 13:57.520
Is that why you
called me up here?

13:57.586 --> 14:00.026
No, no, no.
Here, come have a look‐see.

14:01.026 --> 14:02.860

14:02.926 --> 14:04.226
Staked out
in front of my apartment

of street‐level gargoyle.

‐ Ooh! Ah! What?

little eyes looking over here.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.293
Alright, look, Max,
I love you, but that's it.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.826

‐ Come here.

Okay, okay, Shaw. Think fast,

Oh, no, you can't
go up the stairs

14:39.826 --> 14:41.426

coming up that way.

14:41.493 --> 14:44.593
Alright, I could hit
the soft top of that convertible

14:44.660 --> 14:45.993

14:46.060 --> 14:47.593
In your condition?

14:47.660 --> 14:49.626
Damn!
Kid's slowing me down already.

a tortoiseshell button, alright?

Look, Maxine, you know
I'd be here, right?

16:00.473 --> 16:02.040
And you know
I would do the right thing

16:02.106 --> 16:04.873

of our baby and you.

‐ Well, but in a good way.
