00:58.410 --> 01:03.190
This doesn't connect with the readers. 

01:03.310 --> 01:06.360
You're not conveying the emotions... 

01:06.480 --> 01:08.300
or the tragedy in the plot. 

01:08.420 --> 01:12.170
Let me guess... it's your first? 

01:12.290 --> 01:14.150
With all due respect. 

01:14.270 --> 01:17.210
'Mister' Fujinuma Satoru... 

01:17.330 --> 01:19.940
You need to dig deeper into it. 

01:20.060 --> 01:23.120
The stature of the
artist doesn't come out. 

01:23.240 --> 01:25.780
I'm sure you have it in you. 

01:25.900 --> 01:28.090
Sorry I kept you waiting. 

01:28.210 --> 01:30.090
I'm scared... 

01:30.210 --> 01:32.560
I can't dig into it. 

01:33.630 --> 01:37.380
I'll just be faced with my ineptitude. 

01:41.060 --> 01:44.010
My mind rehashes those images... 

01:44.130 --> 01:47.130
I could have done something... 

01:47.940 --> 01:51.130
it's not that I regret anything. 

01:51.250 --> 01:53.480
It's just an excuse. 

01:53.600 --> 01:58.140
I can't take emotional risks. 

02:07.080 --> 02:09.759
2 deliveries to go. 

02:11.140 --> 02:13.340
Mr. Fujinuma. 

02:13.460 --> 02:16.030
We have an errand. 

02:21.200 --> 02:22.420
Good morning. 

02:22.540 --> 02:26.000
Going on delivery.
-Drive safely. 

02:26.120 --> 02:28.930
On my way.
-See you later. 

02:36.320 --> 02:40.620
Mr. Fujinuma, don't eat
the pizzas on the way. 

02:41.980 --> 02:44.120
Certainly won't. 

02:51.550 --> 02:53.970
I don't get it. 

02:56.800 --> 03:00.380
Is that a good joke to these kids? 

03:00.500 --> 03:04.480
At least, if I could used in my manga. 

03:27.380 --> 03:29.660
It goes unnoticed... 

03:29.780 --> 03:32.310
the routine of each day... 

03:32.430 --> 03:36.890
yet within this routine,
things happen to people... 

03:37.010 --> 03:41.890
and it is the Mangaka's
quest to pick these out. 

03:42.010 --> 03:46.590
And here I am, thinking
about manga again. 

03:47.980 --> 03:50.320
I'm not picking out anything. 

04:16.430 --> 04:18.490
It is happening again. 

04:19.060 --> 04:21.839
No doubt. 

04:27.050 --> 04:30.240
Something is about to happen. 

04:31.090 --> 04:34.400
And it's going to be terrible. 

04:41.300 --> 04:46.010
I'd rather keep out of it,
but I have to find out. 

04:46.130 --> 04:50.570
The anomaly... find out the anomaly. 

04:50.690 --> 04:53.160
Something is off... 

04:53.280 --> 04:55.330
it is going to happen. 

04:55.450 --> 04:59.520
Find out...where is it? Pick it out. 

05:02.540 --> 05:05.730
I found it... the anomaly. 

05:30.290 --> 05:31.840
Hey. 

05:31.960 --> 05:41.160
Stop...Wake up. 

05:46.260 --> 05:47.470
Hey. 

05:48.410 --> 05:50.180
Stop. 

05:57.280 --> 05:59.440
Hey. 

05:59.560 --> 06:00.870
Stop. 

06:00.990 --> 06:02.280
Mr. Fujinuma. 

06:02.400 --> 06:04.490
Wake up. 

06:06.270 --> 06:07.920
Stop. 

06:20.270 --> 06:21.760
There. 

06:21.880 --> 06:23.660
I had it coming. 

06:23.780 --> 06:26.200
I should mind my own business. 

06:43.450 --> 06:44.940
You're awake? 

06:46.900 --> 06:51.470
You remember who you
are? Why you are here? 

06:53.850 --> 06:57.460
I'm Fujinuma Satoru, 29. 

06:58.600 --> 07:01.500
A truck was going to run over a kid... 

07:02.250 --> 07:05.190
instead I ended up in an accident. 

07:05.310 --> 07:08.600
I'm relieved... That was two days ago. 

07:08.720 --> 07:11.810
It's a miracle you're not harmed. 

07:11.930 --> 07:15.180
One last check up and you're good to go. 

07:15.300 --> 07:17.640
Should I call someone? 

07:17.760 --> 07:20.560
Girlfriend? Friend? 

07:21.600 --> 07:24.690
No one needs to know. 

07:27.720 --> 07:30.360
Clip, clip, clip. 

07:30.480 --> 07:32.420
What's that? 

07:32.730 --> 07:36.550
You are, like, wrapped in a membrane. 

07:36.670 --> 07:41.360
You don't open your
heart to anyone, right? 

07:42.640 --> 07:45.780
But I was underestimating you. 

07:45.900 --> 07:47.280
What? 

07:47.400 --> 07:49.280
I saw the accident. 

07:49.400 --> 07:53.130
The truck driver had a heart attack. 

07:53.250 --> 07:55.650
You had a sharp eye. 

08:03.420 --> 08:05.770
Miss Katagiri... 

08:05.890 --> 08:08.890
why do you do this job? 

08:12.460 --> 08:14.940
I have a dream. 

08:15.060 --> 08:17.790
I'll earn my own money to fulfill it. 

08:20.560 --> 08:23.550
When you tell your dream away... 

08:24.300 --> 08:27.280
it is awkward if you don't fulfill it. 

08:27.400 --> 08:29.400
You don't think so? 

08:30.560 --> 08:32.400
I don't 

08:33.090 --> 08:38.110
The words pave the way to your dream. 

08:39.500 --> 08:41.640
Alright, be well. 

08:42.620 --> 08:45.000
I think your mother is coming. 

08:45.120 --> 08:47.120
See you. 

08:51.420 --> 08:53.570
My mother. 

08:54.160 --> 08:56.330
What a drag. 

09:06.020 --> 09:09.940
I call this phenomenon Double-back. 

09:11.450 --> 09:16.070
I double back a few minutes
in time to reenact a scene. 

09:16.190 --> 09:20.100
An instant before something bad happens. 

09:22.260 --> 09:27.440
Like a hand compelling me to stop it. 

09:28.650 --> 09:29.820
And then... 

09:29.940 --> 09:33.330
I have to hinder the incident. 

09:33.450 --> 09:39.260
Most of the time it doesn't
change anything for me. 

09:39.380 --> 09:43.810
But this time there
was a chance witness. 

09:43.930 --> 09:46.160
The law will get involved. 

09:46.280 --> 09:49.920
But they'll have nothing against me. 

10:03.380 --> 10:06.230
Welcome back, Satoru. How do you feel? 

10:06.350 --> 10:11.000
We're not in Hokkaido,
don't forget to lock. 

10:11.120 --> 10:13.770
Are you OK?
-Yep. 

10:13.890 --> 10:17.240
I'll stay with you for a while. 

10:17.360 --> 10:18.380
What? 

10:18.500 --> 10:20.660
Considering your situation. 

10:20.780 --> 10:24.770
Told you I'm, fine. I have
a job, I have my manga. 

10:24.890 --> 10:29.120
You can give your manga a break
when your mother is in town. 

10:29.240 --> 10:32.120
You should even stop this manga dream. 

10:58.240 --> 11:00.020
Tell me, Satoru. 

11:00.140 --> 11:03.730
Is there a direct train to Ueno? 

11:03.850 --> 11:07.660
Course not... So, you're here
for sightseeing after all. 

11:07.780 --> 11:10.920
The little Sakamoto Haruka,
7, who had disappeared... 

11:11.040 --> 11:13.460
was found unharmed today. 

11:13.580 --> 11:16.300
She was taken to the city hospital... 

11:16.420 --> 11:18.860
and declared uninjured and healthy. 

11:18.980 --> 11:22.020
Satoru, you remember? 

11:22.140 --> 11:24.182
What? 

11:25.010 --> 11:27.720
When you were in 5th grade... 

11:27.840 --> 11:30.830
the incident in our neighborhood. 

11:31.370 --> 11:32.890
No. 

11:33.010 --> 11:35.760
We did everything we could... 

11:35.880 --> 11:41.770
to erase the incident
from our kids' memories. 

11:43.650 --> 11:44.780
Satoru. 

11:44.900 --> 11:47.520
You came close too, you know. 

11:58.090 --> 12:03.310
When I was in 5th, there
was a series of abductions. 

12:13.730 --> 12:15.800
Hokkaido: Three elementary
school kids abducted. 

12:16.810 --> 12:21.630
Two of them were in my class. 

12:22.430 --> 12:24.800
And even the perpetrator
they arrested... 

12:24.920 --> 12:27.480
I knew him well. 

12:27.600 --> 12:32.260
Let me guess who are the
cool kids in your class. 

12:33.550 --> 12:36.780
They are cheerful, good at sports... 

12:36.900 --> 12:41.860
they can be foolish but
they are honest... 

12:41.980 --> 12:45.880
and they have a focus in one area. 

12:47.300 --> 12:51.730
If you want friends,
why not emulate these? 

12:51.850 --> 12:55.890
Don't be shy, be brave. 

12:56.860 --> 12:58.250
Brave. 

12:58.370 --> 13:02.940
"be brave", he would often say. 

13:03.060 --> 13:06.790
I called him Mr. Brave. 

13:06.910 --> 13:12.370
Mr. Brave is now in jail on death row. 

13:19.570 --> 13:21.840
The head office is offering you this... 

13:21.960 --> 13:25.160
as a token of our sympathy.
-Thank you. 

13:25.280 --> 13:31.000
They said, the offer still
stands to employ you full time. 

13:31.120 --> 13:35.250
It can even wait until
you give up on manga. 

13:35.370 --> 13:38.240
Thank you for you concern. 

13:38.360 --> 13:41.400
See you tomorrow. 

13:45.180 --> 13:47.140
You always have to buy so much. 

13:47.260 --> 13:49.140
Then let's invite someone over. 

13:49.260 --> 13:51.220
A friend, a girlfriend? 

13:51.340 --> 13:55.290
I don't have any. Manga is my life. 

13:55.410 --> 14:00.430
I told you not to run, don't
cry now. It serves you well. 

14:03.770 --> 14:05.700
Mr. Fujinuma. 

14:10.280 --> 14:13.920
You do have one. One, what? 

14:14.040 --> 14:16.390
You forgot something. 

14:16.510 --> 14:20.510
Are you alright? 

14:25.780 --> 14:30.150
We could invite a friend, a girlfriend. 

14:30.270 --> 14:32.570
A double-back. 

14:32.690 --> 14:36.080
Something is about to happen. 

14:36.200 --> 14:38.130
I told you not to run. 

14:38.250 --> 14:41.000
Mom, please look around. 

14:41.120 --> 14:43.540
I have an odd feeling. 

14:43.660 --> 14:44.890
What? 

14:46.120 --> 14:50.740
You still have these intuitions? 

14:50.860 --> 14:53.840
It happened on the occasion of a fire. 

15:02.010 --> 15:03.900
Mr. Fujinuma. 

15:06.440 --> 15:08.740
You forgot something. 

15:08.860 --> 15:12.020
Miss Katagiri, don't run. 

16:06.050 --> 16:07.930
Mr. Fujinuma. 

16:09.100 --> 16:13.720
You left this book at the
bookstore's counter. 

16:13.840 --> 16:17.170
This lady? 

16:17.290 --> 16:20.630
My mother.
-What? 

16:20.750 --> 16:24.490
I though she was your sister. 

16:24.610 --> 16:27.750
It's a pleasure, I'm Katagiri Airi. 

16:27.870 --> 16:30.660
Likewise, I'm Fujinuma Sachiko. 

16:30.780 --> 16:35.770
I'm going to cook a curry,
would you care to join us? 

16:35.890 --> 16:37.651
Sure, I accept the invitation. 

16:37.771 --> 16:42.180
Let's go then.
-I'm so glad. 

16:45.140 --> 16:49.400
Sure, you're too young
to be his girlfriend. 

16:49.520 --> 16:52.370
You'd have been great in the part. 

16:52.490 --> 16:56.580
Satoru is like... the
friend you respect. 

16:59.920 --> 17:01.720
Too spicy? 

17:03.150 --> 17:05.180
It's very good. 

17:08.365 --> 17:10.108
It's delicious. 

17:10.228 --> 17:12.588
You don't mind going back at night? 

17:12.708 --> 17:14.348
I'm motorized, I'll be fine. 

17:14.468 --> 17:17.220
It was a great meal, thank you. 

17:19.609 --> 17:20.819
Bye. 

17:28.349 --> 17:30.760
You're want find me a bride? 

17:30.880 --> 17:32.460
I look pathetic. 

17:32.580 --> 17:34.870
She's just a colleague. 

17:34.990 --> 17:39.190
You are so blind. She likes you. 

17:39.310 --> 17:41.630
Told you, it's not like that. 

17:45.460 --> 17:49.880
Say... What did you see by the
parking lot, earlier today? 

17:51.640 --> 17:53.940
Ah right... 

17:55.490 --> 17:59.580
I witnessed an attempted
abduction that failed. 

18:00.840 --> 18:03.810
Come on, you know I'm kidding. 

18:34.310 --> 18:35.620
Yes. 

18:47.320 --> 18:52.530
I saw these eyes before... 

18:55.000 --> 18:58.180
I know that kind of energy... 

18:58.750 --> 19:02.400
a seasoned criminal. 

19:05.350 --> 19:08.220
The abductions, 18 years ago. 

19:08.340 --> 19:11.730
We did not end it then. 

19:38.620 --> 19:42.960
Satoru, must know. 

19:43.080 --> 19:46.380
I'm sorry. 

20:07.560 --> 20:11.860
That failed abduction my
mom would have witnessed... 

20:12.820 --> 20:17.100
Sure, she can joke about anything. 

20:17.220 --> 20:22.460
But about such topics, she
always tells the truth. 

20:22.580 --> 20:24.950
After that double-back... 

20:25.070 --> 20:27.950
how was the abduction interrupted? 

20:28.070 --> 20:30.910
She has to tell me more about it. 

20:32.300 --> 20:35.870
Mom, come on, you never lock. 

20:41.790 --> 20:42.560
Hey. 

20:44.770 --> 20:47.890
It's a prank? 

20:49.510 --> 20:52.100
Say something. 

20:55.170 --> 20:57.400
You can stop now. 

21:00.850 --> 21:02.200
Ho. 

21:02.320 --> 21:04.060
Wake up. 

21:06.590 --> 21:10.240
Tell me it is a prank. 

21:13.460 --> 21:17.910
There is a direct train to Ueno. 

21:19.740 --> 21:21.940
Mom. 

22:09.750 --> 22:12.280
What happened, Mr. Fujinuma? 

22:12.400 --> 22:14.730
I heard someone shout... 

22:14.850 --> 22:17.540
What is it? Blood? 

22:41.840 --> 22:46.900
He set me up. 

22:47.020 --> 22:50.150
He wanted me to chase him... 

22:50.270 --> 22:54.150
Now it's me the landlady
saw me fleeing the scene. 

23:00.571 --> 23:05.660
Now I'm the prime suspect
in my mom's murder. 

23:05.780 --> 23:11.350
He had it all set up to
frame me for his crime. 

23:12.770 --> 23:14.790
What is that? 

23:15.250 --> 23:19.360
Is it because my mom saw
that failed abduction? 

23:21.790 --> 23:24.420
Damn. 

23:35.440 --> 23:38.220
Hey you? What are you doing? 

23:40.110 --> 23:45.550
We have a suspicious person...
Stop, what are you doing? 

23:50.340 --> 23:54.070
Now is the time... time
for a double-back. 

23:54.190 --> 24:00.150
If it doesn't happen right
now, I won't help my mother. 

24:14.080 --> 24:18.100
