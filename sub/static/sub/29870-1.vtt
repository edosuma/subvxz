03:50.179 --> 03:54.283
See? I knew you'd forget.
I done a few extra pages for you, man.

03:58.821 --> 04:02.223
You actually done it, bro?
Nice one!

Whoa, congrats.
Congrats, you know.

04:17.672 --> 04:20.774
These times you know we're

04:20.910 --> 04:22.811
Should be lucky
if we even turn up.

04:22.943 --> 04:24.813
If you don't turn up,
you're gonna miss out.

04:24.946 --> 04:26.714
It's gonna be
the best party of the year.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.750

You know you don't need an invite.
Just make sure you come.

Well, then, it's more than
likely I'm gonna be there.

05:07.523 --> 05:09.725
Sorry I missed your calls yesterday.
I was out with my dad.

05:09.857 --> 05:13.294

05:30.112 --> 05:32.080

05:32.213 --> 05:35.549
- Should I FaceTime you?
- Should I tweet you?

05:36.284 --> 05:37.819
Everything is
a joke to you, guys.

05:37.953 --> 05:39.854

08:46.941 --> 08:49.277
Look at these two tings.
Come and go.

08:49.411 --> 08:51.380
I'm taking the one

08:58.887 --> 09:01.556
Marco is. We're just following.
Just buying trainers.

09:01.690 --> 09:04.626

- Timmy, let's go, man.
- No, I'm not going nowhere.

09:12.100 --> 09:16.236
- Unless you want me to go, Leah.
- No, Timmy. You don't have to go.

09:16.370 --> 09:18.305
Excuse me,
but these are our friends.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.909
And I'm not trying

09:20.042 --> 09:21.844
We're not interested,
so if anyone's got to go,

09:21.976 --> 09:23.244
it's you guys.

09:23.378 --> 09:24.747
Why is it always the dead ting
to start talking?

09:24.879 --> 09:26.948
- She's not dead.
- Don't talk to my friend like that.

09:27.081 --> 09:29.585
- Or what?
- Or you'll move from her, man.

09:30.652 --> 09:33.054
What?
Do you want me to wet you up?

09:33.186 --> 09:34.923
I ain't scared of you.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.192
Do you know who I am?

09:37.325 --> 09:39.494
Yeah, you're Peckham man,
Skitz, innit?

Ghetto boy, yeah?

09:45.466 --> 09:47.001

I just live in Deptford.

09:47.134 --> 09:47.968
Wet my man up.

09:48.101 --> 09:49.170
Leave him alone.

09:49.303 --> 09:50.471
- Sayin'...
- Timmy, run!

09:50.604 --> 09:52.273
Move from my boy!
What are you doing?

09:52.407 --> 09:55.243
Hey, are you man mad?
Don't let me wet you up as well.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.279
- Go on, do it!
- Chill, chill.

09:57.412 --> 09:59.913
Nah, nah, nah.
I'll wet this little prick up first.

10:00.047 --> 10:01.383
Then I'll wet
this little pussio up.

10:01.516 --> 10:03.652
Then I'll wet this
Mickey-Mouse-looking bitch up!

10:03.784 --> 10:07.021
Are you dumb? Do you not know
that's Switcher's little brother?

10:08.757 --> 10:09.791
Shit.

10:09.923 --> 10:12.727
- Yeah.
- All right. Sorry, fam, man.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.495
I didn't know, fam.

10:14.628 --> 10:16.598
Yo, Skitz, why are you man
troubling my boy for?

10:16.731 --> 10:20.200
How are you friends with a ghetto yout?
Does your brother know?

10:20.335 --> 10:22.304
We just ducked them fools
out their own ends.

10:22.436 --> 10:24.239
Bruv, he's not ghetto,
he just lives in the area.

10:24.372 --> 10:25.507
He don't know any of them.

10:25.639 --> 10:26.941
Obviously he's gonna
tell you that

10:27.075 --> 10:28.676
when he goes to school here!

10:28.811 --> 10:31.647
If you live in them ends,
you're one of them. Ask your brother.

10:31.779 --> 10:35.316
Skitz, I be real, man. Hear all of
that, but that's my boy, innit?

10:45.759 --> 10:47.862
Hey, yo, chill, man.
It's not worth it, bro.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.597
Fuckin' pussy.

10:50.798 --> 10:52.066
Fuck's sake.

10:54.603 --> 10:58.140
You know, I actually asked my
brother why do Peckham beef ghetto?

10:58.273 --> 10:59.541
And what did he say?

10:59.673 --> 11:02.943
He said, "Cos them man
there, they're pagans."

11:03.076 --> 11:04.546
Well, why are they pagans,
though?

11:04.678 --> 11:06.681
What does "pagans"
even mean, fam?

11:06.815 --> 11:08.148
Bruv, I dunno, man.

11:08.282 --> 11:10.619
All I know is,
if you're from ghetto,

11:10.752 --> 11:14.356
you don't wanna bump up into my
brother and that guy, he hates them.

11:14.489 --> 11:16.624
Is that why your brother
don't like me, then?

11:16.758 --> 11:18.027
Cos I live in this area?

11:18.159 --> 11:19.626
Bruv, what do you mean
my brother don't like you?

11:19.760 --> 11:21.029
Of course he likes you.

11:21.162 --> 11:22.763
No. He doesn't chat to me
the same way he chats

11:22.898 --> 11:24.098
to Dwayne and Hakeem and that.

11:24.231 --> 11:26.233
It's only cos
he's known them longer, bro.

11:26.368 --> 11:28.503
My brother knows
you're my guy. Trust me.

11:28.637 --> 11:30.839
You want something
from the shop?

11:30.971 --> 11:32.506
Nah, I'm cool, man.

11:32.641 --> 11:37.946
Shut up, man. I'm gonna get you
a Supermalt and some chocolate.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.617
- Ah, cool, cool, cool.
- Yes, yes! My bro.

11:44.551 --> 11:47.087
Oh, my days!
Man like Timmy, you know.

11:47.221 --> 11:49.924
- What?
- Oh, my days, blood.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.426

11:51.558 --> 11:53.327
Blood, man,

11:53.461 --> 11:55.729

How you been, Kiron?

11:55.863 --> 11:57.499
Man said Kiron!

11:57.632 --> 12:00.335
All right, listen, listen, listen.
Yo, forget that. Call me Killy.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.403
That's what everyone calls
a man now.

12:02.537 --> 12:04.239
- What you sayin', though, cuz?
- I'm good, man.

12:04.372 --> 12:07.643
Blood, come like you disappeared and
left, man, after primary school?

12:07.776 --> 12:10.277
You know how my mum is.
She had different plans.

12:10.411 --> 12:12.547
Run the shit anyway.
Roughton kicked man out.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.415
This guy.

12:13.547 --> 12:15.182
You still punch a man up, yeah?

12:15.316 --> 12:16.817
Aye, listen, listen, listen.

12:16.951 --> 12:19.553
You, man, you see this brother here?
He can rock, you know?

12:19.687 --> 12:22.890
Blood, he smacked out Shyro's
lights in primary school.

12:23.023 --> 12:25.527
And you know how Shyro gets.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.964
Blood, listen. I didn't.
Listen. I swear I know you.

12:29.096 --> 12:33.634
- No, I don't recognise you from nowhere.
- Should have recognised him.

12:35.402 --> 12:38.407
- Bruv, who you talking to like that?
- What?

12:42.310 --> 12:44.979
Yeah, blood!
Man like Timmy, you know?

12:45.113 --> 12:46.414
T, T, light up, man. Listen.

12:46.547 --> 12:48.716
It's my fault. It's my fault.
It's my fault, bruv.

12:48.850 --> 12:52.053
Sorry. Sometimes I get
faces mixed up, innit?

12:52.186 --> 12:53.620
Don't watch nothing.

12:53.754 --> 12:57.325
Man will see you about anyway,
yeah? Take care, cuz. Yeah?

12:57.993 --> 12:59.326
Let's go, man.

13:00.195 --> 13:02.897
Come, man. It's nothing, bro.
Come, man.

13:03.931 --> 13:06.466
- Pussios, bruv.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.611
Oh, whatever, man.
That was a fluke, man.

13:16.744 --> 13:19.479
What d'you mean fluke, boy?
You're dead.

Yes, Auntie.

13:34.361 --> 13:36.330

13:48.210 --> 13:49.744
It's a joke, T-bone.

13:49.878 --> 13:52.247
We're just out here
like some doughnuts, bruv.

13:52.380 --> 13:55.015
Got man doing ten toes

13:56.149 --> 13:58.486
Why the fuck did you duck out

13:58.619 --> 14:01.556
- Madders, Madders, allow him, man.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.058
You think I forgot about you?

14:03.191 --> 14:04.993
What was we supposed to do
against all them man there?

14:05.127 --> 14:06.862
- You left me and Galis there to die!

14:06.994 --> 14:09.230
No fuckin' way, blood.
Are these youts dumb?

14:09.364 --> 14:10.965

14:21.676 --> 14:24.211

- "These man should retire."

14:24.345 --> 14:27.081

- Retire what? Are you mad?

14:27.215 --> 14:29.084
Gimme that.
We need to pattern up, bro.

They weren't trying to leave no
chance of man surviving that.

21:56.664 --> 21:58.933
You're chatting shit, man.
It was three times in the head

21:59.067 --> 22:00.402
and twice in the chest.

22:00.534 --> 22:02.369
He shot him bare times
cos he hated him so much.

22:02.503 --> 22:05.371
- Nah, see, your story's boogs.

22:10.543 --> 22:12.545
Mm, a peng guy.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.782
It was one of them bruddas from your ends.
Ghetto boy Galis.

22:14.915 --> 22:16.350
You didn't hear about it?

22:16.484 --> 22:18.519
Nah. Wait, if he was ghetto,

22:18.653 --> 22:21.222

Nah, they ain't coming back here, man.

22:30.998 --> 22:32.999
Stepping foot inside the Narm,

22:33.134 --> 22:36.237
- You're talking like a Peckham boy.
- Not even, bro.

22:36.369 --> 22:38.572
All I'm saying is when
it comes to this beef ting,

22:38.706 --> 22:40.241
Narm's not the gang
to be fuckin' with.

22:40.375 --> 22:41.476
Do you get?

22:41.609 --> 22:44.110
Anyway, what are you lot wearing

22:47.115 --> 22:50.118
- Grown and sexy.
- Okay. Tell them again, please?

23:01.928 --> 23:03.197
For Galis, man.

23:04.698 --> 23:06.200
This shit ain't right, man.

23:06.333 --> 23:09.202
Galis should be here
with us now.

23:09.336 --> 23:11.172
Swear Galis was scared
of no one, like.

23:11.305 --> 23:14.475
He actually liked beef.
It was like a sayin' or something.

23:14.608 --> 23:15.877
You know what I mean?

23:17.144 --> 23:19.180
His mum's saying
the funeral's in two weeks.

23:19.312 --> 23:22.616
Used to say he don't want his body
to get eaten by worms and shit.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.218
Yeah, that sounds like Galis.

23:25.349 --> 23:26.286
- You should tell his mum.
- Yeah.

23:26.420 --> 23:28.523
You gonna tell her

23:29.357 --> 23:31.426
- What d'you say?
- You heard me.

23:32.926 --> 23:34.328
It's your fault he's dead.

23:35.696 --> 23:37.965
If you didn't make everyone go
Peckham, then he'd still be here now.

23:38.099 --> 23:39.367
Are you fuckin' mad?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.970
He was on going Peckham
way more than I was!

23:42.102 --> 23:44.804
If you would have said no,
he would have said no.

23:44.938 --> 23:47.707
You're the only person
that could control him.

23:47.841 --> 23:50.511
And for some reason, I dunno
why, but he respected you.

23:50.645 --> 23:53.214
- Do you wanna die, cuz?
- No, leave him, leave him, leave him!

23:53.347 --> 23:55.383
Cos I don't give a shit anymore!

23:55.515 --> 23:58.651
That was my best friend.
My best fuckin' friend.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.821
Then he started rolling with you
and then you fucked up his head.

24:01.955 --> 24:03.490
He dropped you out
to roll with me.

24:03.623 --> 24:06.793

24:06.927 --> 24:09.464

24:13.766 --> 24:16.536
And what, what are you gonna do
now that he's dead, huh?

24:16.670 --> 24:19.840
You gonna scream "RIP" and wear
his fuckin' face on your T-shirt?

24:19.974 --> 24:21.943
I'm gonna catch Switcher
and shoot him dead.

24:22.076 --> 24:23.944
This gang beef is all bullshit!

24:24.811 --> 24:26.848

24:27.814 --> 24:29.282

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just a little bit tired.

30:38.118 --> 30:41.054
I was gonna see if you wanted to
dance, but if you're tired...

30:41.187 --> 30:44.590
Oh, no, no, I do, but I just thought
you were dancing with Dwayne.

30:44.725 --> 30:47.261
Uh, yeah, I was.
It's a party.

30:47.395 --> 30:49.229
You can dance with
more than one person.

30:51.398 --> 30:53.266
Come on, this is my song.

31:38.911 --> 31:41.280
- What the fuck you doing?
- It was just a little dance.

31:41.414 --> 31:43.517
- Punch you up.
- Go on, do it, then.

31:43.650 --> 31:45.418
You're a fucking thug!
You know that?

31:51.925 --> 31:54.328
What gowan in me house?

31:54.461 --> 31:55.730
Get out me house.

I told you, I told you,
I told you I was gonna run this party!

32:19.218 --> 32:21.455
Bro, bro, I can't lie.

32:21.588 --> 32:24.292
That was the best party
I've ever been to, bruv.

32:50.417 --> 32:53.253
Police! Let me see your fuckin' hands!

32:53.387 --> 32:54.588

32:57.057 --> 32:58.192
Don't fucking move!

32:58.324 --> 33:00.259
Do not move! Get down!

33:02.396 --> 33:04.464
Relax, man! I'm on my knees!

33:06.734 --> 33:09.468

- I'm not moving!

33:09.602 --> 33:11.871
Down on your knees,
you black cunt!

33:12.005 --> 33:14.340
Don't you worry!

33:14.474 --> 33:16.944

33:17.077 --> 33:18.612

33:33.827 --> 33:35.362
<i>I know you only
offered to walk me</i>

33:35.495 --> 33:36.830
<i>cos Marco didn't come
to school today.</i>

33:36.964 --> 33:38.732
<i>That's like saying
you only accepted</i>

33:38.866 --> 33:40.500
<i>because Shayanne
wasn't in today.</i>

33:40.632 --> 33:41.936
<i>Could be.</i>

33:43.003 --> 33:45.172
So, did you enjoy
Karina's party, then?

33:45.305 --> 33:46.673
Yeah.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.441
Would have liked to dance
with you for longer, though.

33:48.574 --> 33:52.111
Oh, yeah.
Ah, I'm sorry about that.

33:52.245 --> 33:54.813
I saw that guy punch Marco,
and obviously I had to back him.

33:54.947 --> 33:57.450
I get you wanted
to help your friend,

33:57.583 --> 33:59.052
but what are you
trying to prove?

33:59.186 --> 34:01.388
It's like the other day
with those Peckham guys.

34:01.522 --> 34:03.858
You just stood there
when he had a knife.

34:06.993 --> 34:10.096
Have you watched the new season
of <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

34:13.065 --> 34:16.904
No. I was waiting
to watch them all at once.

34:18.406 --> 34:20.607
They're...
They're all out now, you know?

34:20.739 --> 34:23.676
Yeah, I know.
Gonna watch them this weekend.

34:26.013 --> 34:29.850
Well, my mum's working away
this weekend, so...

34:30.884 --> 34:33.920
you can come watch it
at mine if you like.

34:35.121 --> 34:37.857
Are you really trying to get me
over on a Netflix and chill thing?

34:37.991 --> 34:40.226
No, no, of course not.
I'm just...

34:40.360 --> 34:42.094
It's not even on Netflix.

34:42.228 --> 34:45.132
I just found a good site
to watch it on and, um...

34:45.264 --> 34:47.900
I thought it would be nice
to watch it with someone

34:48.034 --> 34:50.237
who enjoys the show
as much as I do.

34:50.369 --> 34:52.772
More, actually.
Team Lannister.

34:52.906 --> 34:55.609
What? No, no, no, no.
No way. Team Stark.

34:57.110 --> 34:59.847

34:59.980 --> 35:02.449
That's my bus.

35:02.581 --> 35:05.118

people like you starting rumours, fam.

35:15.661 --> 35:17.263
But it's minor anyway.

35:17.397 --> 35:20.200
They let him go on bail cos they
didn't find no evidence, innit?

35:24.605 --> 35:26.172

Have you told Marco about us?

42:04.002 --> 42:05.304
I hope you didn't
tell him everything.

I've actually been trying
to call him all weekend

42:07.206 --> 42:09.543
but I can't get through to him.

42:10.342 --> 42:12.279
Shayanne was happy for us.

42:12.411 --> 42:14.346
Said we're like
Stormzy and Maya Jama.

42:15.348 --> 42:17.016
It don't make sense.

42:17.150 --> 42:19.686
You think it's coincidence
that man went to a shop near...

42:19.819 --> 42:21.354
What happened?
Who done this to you?

42:22.656 --> 42:24.056

- Wait, Kiron done this?

42:30.462 --> 42:33.098
Him and his boys rushed me at that
shop near your yard. But it's cool.

42:33.232 --> 42:34.966
Watch when we catch him.

42:35.101 --> 42:36.936
I'm gonna find him,
I'm gonna fuck him up.

42:37.069 --> 42:38.303

42:45.612 --> 42:47.480
What?
What are you talking about?

42:47.612 --> 42:50.783
You know I'm not part of them.
We were cool in primary and that's it.

42:50.917 --> 42:52.118
You're my brother.
I'm fully with you.

42:52.250 --> 42:54.086
I only have one brother
and that ain't you.

42:54.219 --> 42:56.221
I was calling you
bare times.

42:56.355 --> 42:57.857
I was busy
when you called.

42:57.991 --> 43:00.293
I tried calling you back but
I couldn't get through to you.

43:01.395 --> 43:03.730
Listen, when have I ever,
ever left you during a madness?

43:03.862 --> 43:06.631
We always have each other's
back, you know this.

43:06.766 --> 43:08.868
Cool, if you're with man,
show me where Killy lives.

43:09.002 --> 43:11.237
I don't know where he lives.
I've never been to his house.

43:11.371 --> 43:12.605
I just know he lives
round Lewisham side.

43:12.739 --> 43:15.342
My brother told me
you wouldn't wanna tell me.

43:15.475 --> 43:17.375
Just move, man. You're a snake.

43:18.344 --> 43:20.746
Marco, why are you letting
your brother brainwash you?

43:20.880 --> 43:22.514
You know Timmy
isn't part of a gang,

43:22.648 --> 43:24.250
and he'd never want
to see you get hurt.

43:24.384 --> 43:25.885
Just stop being stupid.

43:26.018 --> 43:27.654
Why the fuck are you talking?

43:27.786 --> 43:29.355
What's this got to do with you?

43:29.489 --> 43:31.757
Hey, come on, man. You ain't got
to talk to her like that bro.

43:32.692 --> 43:35.828
Bro... okay, so you two
finally fucked now, yeah?

43:35.962 --> 43:37.063
Oh!

43:37.196 --> 43:38.831
No wonder she's fighting
your battles.

43:38.964 --> 43:41.867
I see you're still upset,
so just shout me when you've calmed down.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.869
- Let's go, Leah.
- Take your hoe and go.

43:44.003 --> 43:45.837
Ooh!

43:45.971 --> 43:47.506
Wait, who you calling a hoe?

43:47.639 --> 43:50.009
What, you fuckin' dumb?
Bruv, don't...

43:50.976 --> 43:52.110
Oh!

43:52.244 --> 43:54.380
If you ever touch her again...

43:54.514 --> 43:57.984
What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do? Tell me, fam!

44:02.422 --> 44:04.725
- Chill, chill.
- You crazy!

44:17.436 --> 44:19.373
You get Killy's address?

44:27.413 --> 44:29.148
So, hold on,
you're telling me

44:29.281 --> 44:31.050
you go to school
with a broken arm

44:31.183 --> 44:33.718
and you come back
with a fuckin' black eye, bro?

44:34.453 --> 44:36.556
Are you a human punch bag, fam?

44:37.556 --> 44:40.127
Is that what man is now?
A human punch bag, fam?

44:45.331 --> 44:46.432
Right, don't... don't...

You were my friend, man!

51:54.993 --> 51:57.595

Peckhams that killed your girl.

52:11.176 --> 52:13.045
I ain't seen him

52:13.179 --> 52:15.080
Bruv, look, killing Marco
won't bring Leah back.

52:15.214 --> 52:17.016
Think three and a half years
is worth her life?

52:17.148 --> 52:19.918
It wasn't his intention
to kill her, blood.

52:20.052 --> 52:23.922
Look, man, if you could just
forgive him like our God forgives...

52:24.056 --> 52:25.824
God forgives, you know.
I don't, bruv.

52:25.958 --> 52:28.194
She tried
to stop them from killing me,

52:28.326 --> 52:30.929
and he hit her so hard,
so fuckin' hard, Hakeem,

52:31.063 --> 52:34.733

on the ground and died.

54:11.397 --> 54:14.801
It's been a few months.
Takes a bit of time adjusting.

54:15.900 --> 54:17.936
It's got nothing to do

54:19.071 --> 54:22.942

man actually killed her.

54:24.275 --> 54:26.311
It was an accident.

54:26.444 --> 54:30.014
Yeah? You went inside for manslaughter.
You served your time.

Yeah, and men are out there

54:33.052 --> 54:35.755
You need to get your head
back in the fucking game.

54:39.491 --> 54:42.828
I heard them man

55:41.587 --> 55:42.889

55:49.261 --> 55:51.864
I talk to Leah

55:53.165 --> 55:56.268
Tell her that I miss her
and that I still love her.

55:58.371 --> 55:59.772
Are you okay, fam?

56:01.840 --> 56:03.475
Might need to go and see
a doctor or something,

56:03.607 --> 56:05.009
clear your head, bro.

56:05.143 --> 56:08.880
Mum made me go doctor's
when it happened, bruv.

56:09.014 --> 56:11.416
But he just gave me
some tablets and shit, bruv.

56:12.183 --> 56:14.352
They just make me
wanna go to sleep.

56:15.554 --> 56:17.889
But I ain't going to sleep
until I get Marco.

56:18.590 --> 56:20.293
And then I'm gonna go to her.

56:23.694 --> 56:27.199
You sound a bit mad, you know.
How you gonna go to her, bro?

Thank you.

57:11.176 --> 57:13.444
- Sure it was him?
- That's what I thought!

57:13.578 --> 57:15.112
I weren't a hundred at first.

57:15.246 --> 57:17.716
But then I heard some girl call his
name, fam. It's defo him.

57:17.850 --> 57:20.219
I'm not sure if he's still there.
Why'd you take so long?

57:20.353 --> 57:22.755
I had to go get the van.
What's wrong with you, fam?

57:23.556 --> 57:25.491
Hey, younger,
drive a bit further down.

57:29.228 --> 57:31.396
Blood, this van's
a piece of shit as well, cuz.

57:31.529 --> 57:33.165
I can't even open the ting
from the inside.

57:33.299 --> 57:35.501
Hold on, why can't
our next man sit out front?

57:35.634 --> 57:38.270
- There's a space right there.
- What's wrong with you?

57:38.404 --> 57:40.639
Come on.
I'm claustrophobic back here.

57:40.772 --> 57:42.440
I told you before, fam.

57:42.574 --> 57:44.776
Three black men rolling in a van at night.
You don't think it's bait?

57:44.909 --> 57:48.112
Trying to get us nicked or something?
Get comfortable, man.

57:48.246 --> 57:50.549
There's fuckin' duvets
back there anyway, man.

57:51.549 --> 57:53.752
- Yo, baby!
- Sorry, I've got to go.

57:53.884 --> 57:55.486
What you doing?

57:55.621 --> 57:57.289
I was just trying to chat to your friend.
What's wrong with you?

57:57.422 --> 57:59.192
I swear that's my man
over there.

58:00.125 --> 58:02.594
You will regret it.

58:03.962 --> 58:06.297
- It's him.
- No, man, I told you...

58:06.431 --> 58:09.902
Hey, Mad, bust the door.
Let me fuck him up as well. Hey, Mad!

58:11.469 --> 58:12.571
Oi!

58:13.639 --> 58:15.608
Oh, shit! Hey!

58:28.253 --> 58:31.089
Fuck him up, younger!
Smack him up, man!

58:32.725 --> 58:34.927
Fuck him up, man! Don't stop!

58:42.768 --> 58:44.636
Tell Galis I said wagwan.

59:02.355 --> 59:03.221
Fuck.

59:03.355 --> 59:04.923
Hey, wait, wait!
There's feds there!

59:05.056 --> 59:06.458
Wait, bruv! Hey, fam, what...

59:06.592 --> 59:08.895
Oh, my God!
What the fuck happened to Madder?

59:09.027 --> 59:11.696
- Fuck! Is he okay?
- Fam, this is fucked!

59:11.830 --> 59:13.032
Oh, shit!

59:13.165 --> 59:14.933
Open it.
Open the fucking van, fam!

59:15.067 --> 59:17.769
- Get him in.
- Now close the fuckin' door!

59:23.609 --> 59:26.545
Hello? Southwark Hospital.

59:26.677 --> 59:29.581
What is he telling me?

59:31.449 --> 59:32.484
Sorry.

01:00:00.978 --> 01:00:02.514
What you sayin', bro?

01:00:04.081 --> 01:00:05.183
How you feeling?

01:00:05.317 --> 01:00:07.453
How the fuck
do you think I'm feeling?

01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:10.355
Hmm?

01:00:11.422 --> 01:00:15.393
They said... that I'm gonna be
in a fucking wheelchair...

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:21.100
for the rest
of my fuckin' life, man.

01:00:25.136 --> 01:00:26.705
It's cos of you, you know.

01:00:29.674 --> 01:00:33.244
How you let that pussio
stab man up, fam?

01:00:34.712 --> 01:00:38.183
- We're meant to have each other's backs.
- What could I have done?

01:00:39.418 --> 01:00:41.487
What could I have done, bro?

01:00:41.619 --> 01:00:43.656
I couldn't do nothing.

01:00:43.788 --> 01:00:47.993
Bro, you know I wouldn't even
be here if the gun did not jam.

01:00:48.127 --> 01:00:49.728
But you're here, though.

01:00:53.898 --> 01:00:55.333
You're fine.

01:00:59.038 --> 01:01:00.639
What am I gonna do now?

01:01:01.505 --> 01:01:02.641
Hmm?

01:01:04.442 --> 01:01:06.277
Why the fuck are you crying?

01:01:08.313 --> 01:01:09.749
Why the fuck are you...

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.720
I'm the one that ain't never
gonna walk again, man.

01:01:16.788 --> 01:01:18.357
Yeah? I'm a cripple.

01:01:19.525 --> 01:01:20.526
Yeah?

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.329
I'd rather be dead, man.

01:01:24.429 --> 01:01:26.665
I'd rather be dead, cuz.

01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:32.203
Yo, furthermore,
get the fuck out, man.

01:01:33.672 --> 01:01:34.840
Bro, I'm sorry.

01:01:34.973 --> 01:01:37.308
No, get the fuck out, man.

01:01:37.442 --> 01:01:40.346
- I swear I'm gonna...
- Marco, leave me alone, man!

01:01:49.554 --> 01:01:50.821
Marco?

01:01:50.956 --> 01:01:52.558
Marco!

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:53.991
Where you going?

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:55.893
We're in this thing
together now!

01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:03.835
<i>All of this time it's
been you coming for me, yeah?</i>

01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:08.273
Well, now I'm coming for you,
and I swear on my life,

01:02:08.406 --> 01:02:11.243
I ain't gonna stop
until you're fuckin' dead.

01:02:27.025 --> 01:02:28.860
Yo, blood!

01:02:31.128 --> 01:02:33.232
Come on, then! Come quick!

01:02:37.936 --> 01:02:40.572
- Who is that blasting at us?
- Bricker and Skitz!

01:02:40.706 --> 01:02:42.174
You're dead!

01:02:45.243 --> 01:02:47.378
Fuckin' dickhead! Fuck you!

01:02:51.282 --> 01:02:53.618
- Hey, yo, who's that?
- That's Timmy, fam!

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.397
Yo, you fuckin' pussy!

01:03:07.799 --> 01:03:10.668
- Come on, man! Younger, man!
- Bricker, this is bait!

01:03:10.802 --> 01:03:13.005
There's two of them, bruv!
What the fuck, blood?

01:03:13.138 --> 01:03:16.775
Yo, man!
Fuckin' pussios, blood!

01:03:20.078 --> 01:03:22.947
<i>A 23-year-old
man was shot in Peckham last night,</i>

01:03:23.081 --> 01:03:25.951
<i>making him the fifth victim of
gun crime in the last 11 days.</i>

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.753
<i>The police say it's due
to an escalated rivalry</i>

01:03:28.886 --> 01:03:30.922
<i>between two south-east
London gangs.</i>

01:03:33.056 --> 01:03:34.525
You hear that, though?

01:03:35.759 --> 01:03:38.996
- Aren't they the same group that stabbed you?
- I don't know, Mum.

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:40.866
You don't know?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.235
Eh? They need to up their game,
them parents. And the police.

01:03:44.368 --> 01:03:47.305
Otherwise, people like you and your
brother are gonna keep getting hurt!

01:03:47.438 --> 01:03:49.440
- Where you going?
- I'm just going, innit?

01:03:49.574 --> 01:03:52.378
- Yeah. All right, lemme come and help you.
- I'm good.

01:03:55.714 --> 01:03:58.750
- I'll bring your tea?
- Mum, I'm good! I'm good.

01:04:02.721 --> 01:04:04.621
<i>The
underlying issues are social.</i>

01:04:04.755 --> 01:04:08.661
<i>They're educational,
even economic.</i>

01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:20.504
Yo, family.

01:04:26.478 --> 01:04:28.146
What you doing here?

01:04:28.279 --> 01:04:29.380
My cuz been put in a wheelchair.

01:04:29.514 --> 01:04:31.317
What do you think
I'm doing here?

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:35.686
My mum said
it was mistaken identity.

01:04:36.955 --> 01:04:37.922
Come on.

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:39.757
Who done it?

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:43.828
- Madder's younger.
- A yout?

01:04:43.962 --> 01:04:46.331
You let a yout do this to you?
And where was Marco?

01:04:46.464 --> 01:04:49.235
There's nothing
Marco could have done, man.

01:04:51.369 --> 01:04:53.239
It's not even his fault.

01:04:55.507 --> 01:04:58.777
Don't even matter anymore, man.
They've won.

01:04:58.911 --> 01:05:01.013
What are you talking
about, they've won, huh?

01:05:01.145 --> 01:05:03.513
They ain't won shit.
Listen to me.

01:05:03.647 --> 01:05:05.450
It's his little younger, yeah?

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:09.020
I swear to you I'll put him
in the fucking ground. Trust me.

01:05:10.922 --> 01:05:13.157
I'm part to blame
for this shit, man.

01:05:14.592 --> 01:05:17.895
I should never have got you in this
gang bang ting in the first place.

01:05:23.868 --> 01:05:24.969
I'm sorry.

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:29.540
Sorry that this has had
to happen to you, cuz.

01:05:35.279 --> 01:05:36.514
Yeah, well...

01:05:37.815 --> 01:05:40.886
This Madder's younger yout,
yeah?

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.856
I'll find him.

01:05:56.701 --> 01:05:58.302
Let's go, let's go.

01:06:13.351 --> 01:06:15.554
Yeah, more of that,
more of that.

01:06:29.601 --> 01:06:31.869
What the fuck is going on here?

01:06:32.002 --> 01:06:34.072
What the fuck
are these youts doing, bruv?

01:06:38.308 --> 01:06:40.711
Yo, film my olders.
Let the fans see the real goons.

01:06:40.846 --> 01:06:42.880
- You get me?
- Are you filming?

01:06:43.014 --> 01:06:46.418
Blood, don't film me, bruv.
Don't film me, bruv. Gimme that.

01:06:46.551 --> 01:06:48.353
Are you mad?
Oi, Tiny, what's this film for?

01:06:48.487 --> 01:06:50.388
It's for Link Up TV.
It's due to get bare views.

01:06:50.522 --> 01:06:51.956
Do you think
I care about views?

01:06:52.089 --> 01:06:54.625
Huh? You think I want my face
all over YouTube, blood?

01:06:54.759 --> 01:06:56.427
You know the feds
are watching these tings?

01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:58.563
Sorry, Mads, I didn't clock.

01:06:58.697 --> 01:07:00.132
I was just gassed to get
your man in the video,

01:07:00.264 --> 01:07:02.032
but can't you just
give him back?

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:03.469
Oh, shut up, man.

01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:06.003
Are you lot fuckin' stupid,
blood?

01:07:06.138 --> 01:07:07.672
What's wrong with you, fam?

01:07:07.804 --> 01:07:09.040
You know the feds
are on us, bruv.

01:07:09.174 --> 01:07:10.708
Plus, we're in the middle
of a war right now.

01:07:10.842 --> 01:07:13.177
You lot shouldn't even be
on a block like this.

01:07:13.311 --> 01:07:14.645
This ain't a joke, you know.

01:07:14.779 --> 01:07:16.715
Plus, you man
are all chatting bare shit.

01:07:16.848 --> 01:07:18.583
I ain't never seen
one of you little dickheads

01:07:18.717 --> 01:07:20.852
on the block with man once.
You lot don't ride.

01:07:20.985 --> 01:07:23.654
You ain't coming up with man, blood.
You lot pussios, bruv.

01:07:23.788 --> 01:07:25.523
Get the fuck outta my face
furthermore.

01:07:25.656 --> 01:07:27.458
I'm sorry, man.
I weren't thinking.

01:07:27.592 --> 01:07:28.860
I was just gassed
to get your man in the video.

01:07:28.993 --> 01:07:30.828
But if Madder don't
bring back that camera,

01:07:30.962 --> 01:07:32.831
Rashid's never gonna let me
back on his channel again.

01:07:32.964 --> 01:07:36.101
I'm trying to do this rap thing
seriously, like you told me to, bro.

01:07:40.572 --> 01:07:43.074
Yo, Mads, let me chat
to you quickly, bruv.

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:46.077
I know, I know, I know, I know.
It's stupid, bruv.

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:49.080
Just give it back to my man.
He's gonna edit us out of it.

01:07:50.281 --> 01:07:52.451
Trust me, man. I got this, man.

01:07:55.353 --> 01:07:58.289
Cut us out, innit?
Make sure the rest of it's good.

01:07:58.422 --> 01:07:59.756
Understand.

01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:04.696
How'd you get him to give it back?
You got him on lock, innit?

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.965
Everyone says you come like
the older and he's washed.

01:08:07.098 --> 01:08:08.233
What? Why?

01:08:08.366 --> 01:08:11.369
Cos you're always saving him,
like against Switcher.

01:08:11.502 --> 01:08:12.870
Lemme tell you something.

01:08:13.003 --> 01:08:15.206
Don't listen to what people say
cos people chat shit.

01:08:15.339 --> 01:08:16.573
Yeah?

01:08:16.707 --> 01:08:18.343
I don't mind you
calling yourself Tiny Madder,

01:08:18.475 --> 01:08:20.078
but be your own man.

01:08:20.212 --> 01:08:23.180
Focus on the music ting,
you could be the next Dave or something.

01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:24.850
Understand?

01:08:24.982 --> 01:08:27.453
See you later, bro.
Love, love, love, love.

01:08:41.966 --> 01:08:43.569
Oh, my days.

01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:48.538
What gowan den?

01:08:50.808 --> 01:08:52.743
I swear to God Imma ride out
on dem man tonight.

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:54.611
There ain't no point
in you lot going out there.

01:08:54.745 --> 01:08:56.680
- Who the fuck is this?
- Yo.

01:08:57.615 --> 01:08:59.015
My big cousin, man.
He's from Tottenham.

01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:01.319
Hey, yo, Switch.
What you bring him here for, fam?

01:09:01.453 --> 01:09:04.055
We don't need help.
We got these men on the ropes right now.

01:09:04.188 --> 01:09:06.157
Yet the younger who put
my cousin in a wheelchair

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:07.359
is still breathing.

01:09:07.491 --> 01:09:09.060
Come on, bro.

01:09:10.294 --> 01:09:12.663
Look, I know you man
have been putting in the work.

01:09:12.798 --> 01:09:16.067
Yeah? It's obvious.
It's all over the news and that.

01:09:17.035 --> 01:09:19.770
But all it's doing
is getting your man dem nicked

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:21.706
and making feds more on it.

01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:23.407
You men have to
start moving smarter.

01:09:23.542 --> 01:09:25.977
We deal with things how we
wanna deal with it round here.

01:09:26.111 --> 01:09:28.412
I don't know how you man
handle things in Tottenham.

01:09:28.546 --> 01:09:29.813
How about you deal
with them Hackney youts

01:09:29.946 --> 01:09:31.915
before you come here
chatting shit.

01:09:32.049 --> 01:09:34.017
Alie, Bricker?
Them man, they know nothing.

01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:35.886
Let's just do
what we've been doing.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.988
It's true, though, Skitz, man.

01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:39.857
Yeah, we've been
applying pressure every day,

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:42.125
but Timmy's still
out there breathing, fam.

01:09:42.259 --> 01:09:44.962
That's why you should have let
me wet him up back in the day.

01:09:46.497 --> 01:09:49.401
All right, then, big cousin.
What do you suggest we do?

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:51.536
- Wait.
- Man said "wait."

Look, it's all over

01:10:21.532 --> 01:10:24.968
The only people that are gonna be out
there on their block are the feds.

01:10:25.102 --> 01:10:26.870
Don't make no sense
us going right now.

01:10:27.771 --> 01:10:29.340
Hey, you don't talk

01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:33.278

01:10:34.145 --> 01:10:35.213
You know what?

01:10:36.748 --> 01:10:39.151

01:10:41.986 --> 01:10:44.889

01:10:52.929 --> 01:10:54.799
Oi, no one ain't gonna
get touched, you know?

01:10:54.932 --> 01:10:57.602
Just stand

01:11:13.017 --> 01:11:15.287
Is that what you're going on,
yeah, younger?

01:11:17.888 --> 01:11:19.856

All I'm saying is,

it's not a good idea
to go out there today, innit?

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:27.231
That's all.

01:11:27.365 --> 01:11:28.634
Man dem, you seeing this?

01:11:30.034 --> 01:11:33.804
He's either shook of Bricker
or he's playin' both sides.

01:11:35.072 --> 01:11:36.840
You don't wanna kill Bricker,
do you?

01:11:36.975 --> 01:11:39.678
You know what Bricker done.

01:11:40.978 --> 01:11:42.748
What did Bricker do?

01:11:44.915 --> 01:11:46.685
Huh? What did he do?

01:11:48.453 --> 01:11:50.989
- Killed your little slag girlfriend.

01:11:55.927 --> 01:11:59.197
Don't hold him! Huh?
You wanna test me, yeah?

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:01.633

You're wrong for that,
bruv, you know that?

01:12:19.816 --> 01:12:21.386
You can't talk about
a man's girl like that.

01:12:21.518 --> 01:12:22.686
What's wrong with you?

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.789
What, you're picking him
over me?

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:26.991
I'm not picking no one.
It's not a side ting.

01:12:27.124 --> 01:12:28.726
You was wrong for that.
This is a team.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.629

<i>I'm outside yours,
but come downstairs, man.</i>

01:13:20.477 --> 01:13:21.512
You'd better shoot me now.

01:13:21.646 --> 01:13:22.880
Calm down, bro.
Calm down, man.

01:13:23.013 --> 01:13:25.016

01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:27.618
I ain't got my shank,
my strap, nothing.

01:13:27.752 --> 01:13:29.286
Come here to chat.

01:13:29.419 --> 01:13:31.922

01:13:33.023 --> 01:13:35.026
you being a snake and that.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.196
I know it was
out of order, man.

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.031
Come to apologise.

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:44.835
You called her a slag.

01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:49.374
I know.

01:13:51.308 --> 01:13:54.445
It's just, I was meant to be the
one to put Switcher down, man.

01:13:56.114 --> 01:13:58.784
It's just, I put my whole life
into this shit.

01:14:00.651 --> 01:14:01.986
I been putting in work out here,

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.023
doing tings I didn't even
wanna do on these streets.

01:14:06.656 --> 01:14:09.393
I ain't been getting the love
that you've been getting.

01:14:10.495 --> 01:14:12.998
So you just came here
to apologise, yeah?

01:14:14.932 --> 01:14:17.936
- Yeah.
- So, why you come in a van?

01:14:18.803 --> 01:14:20.539
Killy's got the drop on Bricker.

01:14:20.672 --> 01:14:23.174
Said he's at some girl's yard
in Old Kent Road.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:26.811
Going to pick him up now,
grabbing the tings.

01:14:26.945 --> 01:14:28.045
Going right down there.

01:14:28.178 --> 01:14:29.947
So, why didn't Killy tell me?

01:14:30.815 --> 01:14:32.083
I told him not to tell you.

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:34.853
I wanted to see
exactly what you was on.

01:14:36.087 --> 01:14:37.856
Who do you really wanna kill?

01:14:39.423 --> 01:14:40.958
Me or Bricker?

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:49.968
Don't ever talk about her
like that again.

01:14:53.103 --> 01:14:54.505
Let's go before he gets away.

01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:02.180
How did Killy get the info?

01:15:07.651 --> 01:15:09.087
Yo!

01:15:20.263 --> 01:15:22.801
- Hey, YM, wind down the window, fam.

01:15:22.933 --> 01:15:25.102
Wind down the window, man.

01:15:28.039 --> 01:15:30.407
Hey, listen, I can't sit
in the back no more.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.342
My back's fucked
from the other day, blood.

01:15:32.476 --> 01:15:34.746
You know the rules
when it comes to the front seat.

01:15:34.879 --> 01:15:35.980
Come on, blood.

01:15:36.112 --> 01:15:37.248
What, man can't allow me
the front seat

01:15:37.382 --> 01:15:39.150

01:15:39.282 --> 01:15:41.486
Come on by you, man,

01:15:43.687 --> 01:15:45.889

01:15:46.023 --> 01:15:48.959
All right, listen,

01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:54.165
Who's smoking, man?

01:15:55.032 --> 01:15:57.767
- Oh, Mads. Allow it, man.
- Joker, man.

01:15:59.370 --> 01:16:00.938
Shit, blood.

01:16:29.866 --> 01:16:32.469
If man don't hurry up,
he's not gonna be there.

01:16:32.602 --> 01:16:35.072
You want me to go
down there naked or something?

01:16:39.944 --> 01:16:41.413
Chill, man.

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.956
- Yo! I wanted to stretch my legs, man!
- Keep an eye out!

01:16:52.089 --> 01:16:53.458
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:55.826
Killy, bust the door.
I wanna stretch my legs.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.029
Gimme two minutes.
I'm just pissing, bro.

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:43.641
Hey, somebody already

01:17:48.012 --> 01:17:49.313

01:17:52.049 --> 01:17:53.317
I swear that's my ting.

01:17:54.284 --> 01:17:56.020

01:17:57.954 --> 01:18:01.025
Think I'm gonna hold on to this

01:18:01.892 --> 01:18:03.361
Who the fuck are you?

01:18:03.494 --> 01:18:06.731
Your younger put my little
cousin in a fucking wheelchair.

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:12.035
You fuckin' snake.

01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:13.737

Your boy Killy sold you out.

01:18:44.869 --> 01:18:46.004
Who's that?

01:18:46.737 --> 01:18:48.905
You know,
I told you, innit?

01:18:49.873 --> 01:18:53.277
I told you I wasn't gonna stop

01:18:56.947 --> 01:18:58.148
Marco?

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:01.218
Bust the door

01:19:01.352 --> 01:19:03.555
What do I need
to bust the door for?

01:19:04.355 --> 01:19:06.424
You're gonna die where you are.

01:19:16.868 --> 01:19:18.335
What you doing?

01:19:19.837 --> 01:19:21.473
Hey, what's that smell?

01:19:22.373 --> 01:19:23.575

01:19:26.977 --> 01:19:28.411
Oi, help! Oi, Madder, help!

01:19:28.545 --> 01:19:30.114

We're cool, blood.
We've always been cool.

01:19:33.517 --> 01:19:35.286
But you said it yourself, cuz.

01:19:35.419 --> 01:19:37.121
My man's getting
too big for his boots.

01:19:37.254 --> 01:19:40.657
I just introduce you and you turn
him into your younger straight away?

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:43.761

01:19:45.295 --> 01:19:46.929

Oi, fuck you, Marco!
Lemme out and face me like a man, fam!

01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:54.271
Did you face my brother

01:19:54.405 --> 01:19:57.542
No! You stabbed him
in the fuckin' back!

01:19:57.674 --> 01:20:00.177
Fam, it's that weed, fam.
What's wrong with you?

01:20:00.311 --> 01:20:01.346
I've seen it, fam.

01:20:01.478 --> 01:20:03.146
Younger's always

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.714
I've always shown you love!

01:20:04.848 --> 01:20:07.150
My man's offering me four boxes

01:20:07.285 --> 01:20:08.419
I already got two.

01:20:08.553 --> 01:20:09.920
I get the other two

01:20:10.053 --> 01:20:11.554
I'll even give you one.

01:20:11.688 --> 01:20:13.624
Hey, don't play games or nothing.
I told you three boxes.

01:20:13.758 --> 01:20:14.826

01:20:45.655 --> 01:20:46.689
Fuck that!

01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:50.728
Blood, you might be all right with
living in my man's shadow, cuz,

01:20:50.861 --> 01:20:52.897
but I've done that shit
my whole life.
