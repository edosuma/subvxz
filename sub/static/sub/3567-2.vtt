Episode 1b
"Laser Light Cannon"

00:05.910 --> 00:08.220
Hey, Fryman, give me the bits!

00:08.650 --> 00:10.280
Steven, we're closed!

00:10.690 --> 00:12.080
Ohh, what...

00:12.600 --> 00:16.070
Give him the bits!
The bits! The bits!

00:16.260 --> 00:19.700
The bits! The bits! The bits!

00:19.780 --> 00:22.500
Okay, okay. Take it easy
on the counter, will ya?

00:23.080 --> 00:24.220
Yes!

00:27.520 --> 00:29.600
I can give you actual
fries, if you want.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.420
Just the bits, please.

00:32.200 --> 00:32.810
Thanks!

00:35.340 --> 00:38.100
Ahh, sunset - my favorite time of day.

00:38.670 --> 00:43.380
The sun goes down, and the second
sun gets bigger and bigger in the sky.

00:45.340 --> 00:48.170
Yeah, that big, hot second suuu...

00:49.450 --> 00:51.620
Oh, no, what is that doing here?

00:52.960 --> 00:53.590
What is it?

00:53.840 --> 00:55.360
Aah! My bits!

00:56.750 --> 00:57.820
This is bad.

00:58.370 --> 00:59.820
Look at the size of it!

01:00.190 --> 01:02.280
I had no idea these things were so big!

01:02.290 --> 01:03.850
Garnet! Pearl!

01:04.819 --> 01:05.640
We saw!

01:05.840 --> 01:08.470
Some of us are trying
to protect humanity!

01:08.750 --> 01:09.760
Where were you?

01:11.030 --> 01:11.900
Eating fry bits.

01:12.350 --> 01:12.940
Ugh.

01:13.470 --> 01:14.130
Can I see?

01:15.140 --> 01:16.440
Whoa.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.540
It's a giant eyeball!

01:20.770 --> 01:21.870
Awesome!

01:21.930 --> 01:24.870
Not awesome, it a red eye!

01:25.110 --> 01:28.010
A red eye?
It's going to infect us all!

01:28.090 --> 01:29.500
That's pinkeye, Steven.

01:30.660 --> 01:32.610
It's going to crash into Beach City,

01:32.710 --> 01:36.630
and crush us, along with a bunch
of oblivious, innocent people!

01:36.700 --> 01:38.190
We have to stop it!

01:38.330 --> 01:39.720
What are we going to do?

01:40.110 --> 01:42.920
The only thing powerful enough
to destroy it is a light cannon,

01:42.920 --> 01:44.460
that belonged to Rose Quartz.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.310
My mom?

01:45.320 --> 01:48.260
If Rose were here,
this would be so easy.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.880
I know, but she is not,
and the cannon is missing.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.900
We'll have to find another solution.

01:54.090 --> 01:56.980
If it belonged to my mom, I
bet my dad knows where it is.

01:57.090 --> 02:00.620
He can help us save the day!
Huh?! Eh?!

02:01.450 --> 02:04.410
Greg is... nice, Steven.

02:04.910 --> 02:08.979
But I doubt Rose would entrust someone
like <i>him</i> with such a powerful weapon.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.800
Your dad is kind of a mess, Steven.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.910
Amethyst!

02:12.070 --> 02:13.300
I'm just saying!

02:13.420 --> 02:15.290
Even if she <i>did</i> leave it with him,

02:15.290 --> 02:19.230
he probably broke it, or lost it,
or dropped it in the ocean by now.

02:19.710 --> 02:20.420
True...

02:20.740 --> 02:23.650
No way! I'm sure he is just
keeping it somewhere safe.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.800
I'll go ask him.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.700
We can handle this, Steven.

02:27.290 --> 02:27.770
Ready?

Uh, I'm gonna go.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.640
Okay, good luck.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.800
Dad, it's me!
Daaad?

02:45.470 --> 02:46.470
Are you in there?

02:47.220 --> 02:48.630
Wake... up!

02:48.890 --> 02:50.610
We have to save the world!

02:53.600 --> 02:54.510
Dad!

03:01.790 --> 03:03.780
Who's there? I have a waffle iron!

03:04.350 --> 03:05.200
Dad, it's me!

03:10.010 --> 03:10.750
Steven?

03:14.150 --> 03:15.740
I almost waffled your face!

03:15.950 --> 03:17.480
What are you doing up so late?

03:17.480 --> 03:20.560
What do you mean? The sun
just went down an hour ago.

03:22.510 --> 03:24.850
It was a slow day at the car wash.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.010
Anyway, what's up?

03:26.350 --> 03:30.170
Just needed to see your old man, pal
around, learn some lessons about life?

03:30.480 --> 03:31.160
No!

03:31.310 --> 03:34.420
I need the light cannon that belonged
to mom to blow up that eyeball!

03:34.710 --> 03:35.600
Eyeball?

03:35.760 --> 03:36.430
That!

03:43.430 --> 03:45.310
Wait. Is that a magical thing?

03:45.380 --> 03:47.790
The gems told me not to
get involved with magic stuff.

03:48.050 --> 03:51.080
I-it could be dangerous or interfere
with what's left of my hair.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.100
But they need mom's cannon.
You've got to know where it is!

03:54.270 --> 03:59.070
Like a cave dungeon or a cloud fortress
or in a clam at the bottom of the ocean.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.540
Well, I don't know about all that,
but I have an idea where it might be.

04:05.110 --> 04:06.950
A magical storage unit!

04:08.300 --> 04:11.430
Not exactly. But some would
say there's magic inside.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.970
It's just a shed I use to keep
things that don't fit in the van.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.480
If it's anywhere... it'll be in here.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.270
If I'm going in there,
I'm gonna need some gear.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.480
Here I go!

04:35.610 --> 04:36.280
Good luck!

04:38.730 --> 04:40.080
Whoa!

04:40.760 --> 04:42.100
Cool!

04:42.460 --> 04:44.120
It's like a dad museum!

04:51.150 --> 04:52.210
There it is!

04:56.830 --> 04:58.060
Do you golf?

04:58.270 --> 05:02.930
Ah, I like to think of myself as
someone who would golf... eventually.

05:04.330 --> 05:05.200
Yes!

05:06.920 --> 05:07.590
A drum.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.640
No.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.280
No.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.000
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

05:18.060 --> 05:18.880
Is this...?

05:23.030 --> 05:25.090
"Buy t-shirt cannons"?

05:27.220 --> 05:29.840
Hey, there's a bunch
of copies of your old CD!

05:30.930 --> 05:33.800
Oh, man.
I couldn't give those things away.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.420
You know, before I ran the car wash,

05:36.420 --> 05:39.360
when I was a one-man band,
I travelled the whole country.

05:39.660 --> 05:41.060
I know, dad.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.870
When I came to play a concert here in
Beach City, no one showed up except...

05:44.930 --> 05:46.260
An alligator!

05:46.450 --> 05:47.730
No, it was your mother.

05:48.530 --> 05:49.370
I know.

05:49.630 --> 05:51.510
And we were always
together after that,

05:51.860 --> 05:54.560
until she gave up her physical
form to bring you into the world.

05:55.090 --> 05:59.110
I don't know what a magic lady like her
ever saw in a plain old dope like me.

06:00.340 --> 06:01.370
Uh, dad?

06:01.670 --> 06:03.000
I broke a photo.

06:03.090 --> 06:03.980
It's okay, buddy.

06:04.490 --> 06:07.400
If every pork chop were perfect,
we wouldn't have hot dogs.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.510
The light cannon!

06:12.470 --> 06:14.850
Oh, boy. That thing's
giving me the willies.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.200
Dad, I found it!

06:16.730 --> 06:17.400
Really?

06:19.430 --> 06:20.360
Get the van!

06:32.510 --> 06:34.050
This thing could save the city!

06:34.140 --> 06:35.760
We've got to get it to the beach!

06:36.040 --> 06:38.290
How? It's too big for the van.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.360
Is it gonna be okay?

06:59.900 --> 07:01.850
If every pork chop were perfect...

07:01.880 --> 07:03.880
we wouldn't have hot dogs!

07:05.070 --> 07:07.970
That thing's getting huge!
It's freaking me out!

07:08.410 --> 07:10.180
Can't the van go any faster?

07:11.270 --> 07:12.570
This <i>is</i> faster!

07:13.030 --> 07:15.800
Don't worry. Come on.
Let's put on your CD.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.810
Huh, really? Uh,
come on, you've heard it.

07:20.380 --> 07:21.510
You come on.

07:26.040 --> 07:30.730
♫ I know I'm not that tall
I know I'm not that smart ♫

07:31.260 --> 07:34.430

♫ I'll drive us into outer space ♫

07:58.270 --> 08:00.700
Throw me again.
I think I'm cracking it.

08:01.590 --> 08:02.620
Is that?

08:02.620 --> 08:03.290
Hey, guys!

08:05.500 --> 08:07.110
He really had it.

08:07.430 --> 08:08.920
We're saved!

08:21.180 --> 08:23.620
♫ Let me drive my
Van into your heart ♫

08:23.620 --> 08:24.900
We have to use it now.

08:26.610 --> 08:29.080
I don't know how it works!
It was Rose's!

08:29.700 --> 08:31.060
Dad, how do we use it?

08:33.340 --> 08:35.340
Steven, this is serious.

08:35.860 --> 08:38.929
The gem. You have Rose's gem!

08:39.780 --> 08:40.490
That's it!

08:44.470 --> 08:45.680
Ugh! Come on!

08:45.710 --> 08:46.500
Stop that!

08:46.840 --> 08:48.090
It's no use!

08:48.200 --> 08:50.690
Fine! Forget it!
Throw me again!

08:50.890 --> 08:52.200
That's not going to work!

08:53.520 --> 08:56.890
I got this!
No! Wait! No, maybe I don't!

08:58.880 --> 09:03.230
Please, work. Unlock.
Activate. Go. Please?

09:03.900 --> 09:06.520
Everyone's counting on you!
You can't just be useless!

09:06.580 --> 09:07.730
I know you can help!

09:08.030 --> 09:12.550
It's okay, Steven! We'll figure out
something else! Something even better!

09:13.130 --> 09:17.740
R-right! If every pork chop were
perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs!

09:27.250 --> 09:28.160
It's working!

09:37.420 --> 09:37.950
Steven!

09:38.440 --> 09:39.270
This is it.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.060
Brace yourselves!

10:10.550 --> 10:13.580
Steven, you just saved
most of Beach City!

10:14.180 --> 10:15.920
Sorry about that!

10:17.480 --> 10:18.080
What?

10:19.100 --> 10:20.730
How did you get it to work?

10:21.070 --> 10:23.340
I just said that thing
that dad always says.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.290
That thing about pork rinds?

10:25.850 --> 10:26.630
Hot dogs.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.030
Rose.

10:36.900 --> 10:37.980
My van!

10:38.310 --> 10:39.510
It's okay, dad.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.570
If every pork chop were perfect...

10:41.570 --> 10:42.930
I live in there!

10:43.670 --> 10:44.570
Wait up!
