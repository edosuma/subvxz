<i>--spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.</i>

00:07.053 --> 00:09.647
<i>Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.</i>

00:09.822 --> 00:11.380
<i>Really? Are they looking into...</i>

00:11.557 --> 00:13.889
<i>... free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?</i>

00:14.060 --> 00:16.392
<i>Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.</i>

00:16.562 --> 00:19.429
<i>They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.</i>

00:19.598 --> 00:22.226
<i>Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.</i>

00:22.401 --> 00:23.766
<i>Who do you like?</i>

00:23.936 --> 00:26.234
<i>So far,
I like what I'm seeing in New York.</i>

00:26.405 --> 00:29.499
<i>They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.</i>

00:29.675 --> 00:32.269
<i>And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...</i>

00:32.445 --> 00:34.879
<i>... with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.</i>

00:35.047 --> 00:37.914
<i>Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago World Series...</i>

00:38.084 --> 00:40.678
<i>- ... possible Los Angeles.
Could be a dark horse.</i>

00:40.853 --> 00:42.753
<i>Hold him to it
at the end of the season.</i>

00:42.922 --> 00:45.049
<i>That's gonna do it for us
from the Sports Desk.</i>

00:45.224 --> 00:48.091
<i>- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
Thanks for nothing, Eddie.</i>

00:48.260 --> 00:52.890
<i>Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.</i>

00:53.566 --> 00:56.501
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

00:56.669 --> 00:59.297
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

00:59.472 --> 01:04.569
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

01:04.744 --> 01:06.575
Thank you for joining us this morning.

01:06.746 --> 01:11.581
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

01:11.751 --> 01:14.447
Well, the premise is quite simple.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.987
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

01:18.157 --> 01:21.456
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

01:21.627 --> 01:23.254
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.

01:23.429 --> 01:25.226
In this case, the measles virus...

01:25.398 --> 01:30.563
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

01:30.736 --> 01:34.035
Um, I'm not... I find the best way
to describe it is...

01:34.206 --> 01:36.697
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

01:36.876 --> 01:41.745
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

01:41.914 --> 01:44.940
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

01:45.117 --> 01:48.416
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

01:48.587 --> 01:51.920
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

01:52.091 --> 01:54.389
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

01:54.560 --> 01:58.189
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

01:58.364 --> 02:02.095
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.

02:02.268 --> 02:05.396
So you have actually cured cancer?

02:05.571 --> 02:09.234
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

What you see? What you see?

04:47.866 --> 04:49.265
Damn.

07:37.236 --> 07:38.430
Let's go, Sam.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.862
Come on.

08:51.543 --> 08:54.171
<i>Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.</i>

08:54.346 --> 08:57.713
<i>Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...</i>

08:57.883 --> 09:01.250
<i>... it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...</i>

09:01.420 --> 09:04.719
<i>... to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.</i>

09:04.890 --> 09:07.188
Here you go. Just the way you like it.

09:07.526 --> 09:09.426
Disgusting.

09:10.262 --> 09:12.856
Excuse me, excuse me.

09:13.866 --> 09:16.960
All right. Come on, relax.

09:17.236 --> 09:20.399
<i>However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.</i>

09:20.572 --> 09:24.838
<i>There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.</i>

09:25.010 --> 09:27.808
<i>No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...</i>

09:27.980 --> 09:29.971
There you go.

09:32.117 --> 09:35.518
<i>I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.</i>

09:35.954 --> 09:38.184
<i>And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.</i>

09:38.357 --> 09:43.260
<i>In New York, in 30 Rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.</i>

09:43.428 --> 09:44.827
<i>Back to you, Matt and Katie.</i>

09:44.997 --> 09:49.400
<i>Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.</i>

09:49.568 --> 09:51.433
<i>- And then it turns brown.
If that.</i>

09:51.603 --> 09:53.161
<i>Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.</i>

09:53.338 --> 09:56.796
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

09:56.975 --> 10:00.069
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

10:00.245 --> 10:02.713
<i>Good morning. This morning,
all up the East Coast...</i>

10:02.881 --> 10:06.749
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

10:06.919 --> 10:09.820
<i>The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.</i>

10:11.523 --> 10:15.254
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

10:15.928 --> 10:18.226
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

10:18.397 --> 10:22.163
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

10:22.334 --> 10:25.326
Deal? Deal?

10:30.175 --> 10:31.699
Come on.

10:35.147 --> 10:39.675
<i>Don't worry
About a thing</i>

10:41.653 --> 10:45.919
<i>'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right</i>

10:47.025 --> 10:49.289
I know that feels good.

10:50.829 --> 10:54.993
<i>Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds</i>

10:55.167 --> 10:57.397
Ah, Sam.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.405
<i>Singin' sweet songs
Of melody...</i>

11:32.838 --> 11:34.396
I'm all right.

11:34.573 --> 11:36.541
I'm all right, it's all right.

13:04.362 --> 13:07.661
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.596
- Cell service is down.
- Where are we going?

13:09.768 --> 13:12.328
- Can't get used to the new regs.
Going to Aunt Sara's.

13:12.504 --> 13:16.235
- Ma! No! Why?
- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

13:16.408 --> 13:19.400
We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
- Copy.

13:19.978 --> 13:23.311
- Thirty minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.

13:29.087 --> 13:32.420
- Seal off the island? This island?
- But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.

13:32.591 --> 13:34.422
Did you bring all the money?
Yeah.

13:34.593 --> 13:35.924
How much?
Six hundred.

13:36.094 --> 13:37.356
Why did you say, "You're going"?

13:37.529 --> 13:38.894
That's not enough.
- Robert.

13:39.064 --> 13:40.998
You said, "You're going,"
not, "We're going."

13:41.166 --> 13:45.068
When you get across, I need you to get
to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.

13:45.237 --> 13:48.001
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

13:48.173 --> 13:50.266
Bring enough food for two weeks.

13:50.442 --> 13:52.967
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

13:53.245 --> 13:54.837
Is it airborne?

13:55.013 --> 13:57.982
But we only go to Aunt Sara's
in the summer.

13:58.150 --> 13:59.947
- It may be.
- Oh, my God.

14:00.118 --> 14:03.849
- It's Christmas. What about my presents?
- He's announcing it.

14:04.022 --> 14:06.388
<i>Make no mistake, Americans, this virus...</i>

14:06.558 --> 14:08.492
You left my Christmas presents
in the closet.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.649
Hush now, Mar.

14:09.828 --> 14:13.594
<i>- threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation...</i>

14:13.765 --> 14:16.029
- Mommy, look, it's a butterfly.
- Marley, enough!

14:16.201 --> 14:20.729
<i>And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...</i>

14:20.906 --> 14:23.739
<i>... that tonight I have signed
an executive order...</i>

14:23.909 --> 14:28.141
<i>... initiating a military quarantine
of New York City.</i>

14:28.313 --> 14:30.281
<i>God be with us.</i>

14:30.448 --> 14:32.507
<i>This has been a special...</i>

14:34.352 --> 14:39.221
The window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

14:39.391 --> 14:42.883
...we can reverse the spread.

14:46.998 --> 14:49.296
I can still fix this.

14:50.268 --> 14:54.227
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.

14:54.973 --> 15:00.206
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

15:00.512 --> 15:02.036
What are you doing?

15:04.282 --> 15:06.409
What am I doing?

15:08.019 --> 15:09.782
I'm not gonna let this happen.

15:09.955 --> 15:11.820
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control...

15:13.191 --> 15:14.852
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!

15:29.241 --> 15:31.402
How'd you sleep?

16:05.944 --> 16:08.674
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

16:09.214 --> 16:10.374
Uh-uh.

16:10.548 --> 16:12.106
I'll be back.

16:45.116 --> 16:50.053
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
GA series, serum 391.

16:50.221 --> 16:53.247
Animal trials. Streaming video.

17:15.046 --> 17:17.810
GA series results appear typical.

17:22.954 --> 17:28.290
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

17:28.460 --> 17:34.797
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.

17:34.966 --> 17:38.868
Compounds 2, 5, 7...

17:39.037 --> 17:43.303
...12, 13, 15, 17...

17:43.541 --> 17:45.873
...all killed the host.

17:51.649 --> 17:53.708
Hold on a second.

17:58.990 --> 18:02.391
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.725
Partial pigmentation return.

18:07.799 --> 18:09.790
Slight pupil constriction.

18:10.869 --> 18:14.327
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...

18:14.506 --> 18:16.531
...next candidate for human trials.

18:16.908 --> 18:19.240
You hang in there, number six.

19:02.253 --> 19:04.380
Yeah, that's what you want.

19:27.645 --> 19:29.112
Hey!

19:29.280 --> 19:32.181
Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

19:32.350 --> 19:34.910
What are you guys doing here so early?

19:35.386 --> 19:39.686
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

19:44.596 --> 19:46.860
I'll see you guys inside.

19:56.574 --> 19:58.405
What's happening, buddy?

20:14.526 --> 20:16.153
Yes.

20:39.851 --> 20:42.376
Good morning, Hank.
I'm midway through the G's.

20:44.556 --> 20:47.423
Hey, who's the girl in...?

20:51.296 --> 20:53.958
Never mind.
Hey, I'll see you in the morning.

20:59.304 --> 21:00.532
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

21:01.139 --> 21:02.868
"Hello.

21:03.241 --> 21:05.607
Wanna see some infected rats?"

21:11.849 --> 21:15.615
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

21:24.896 --> 21:26.523
Psst.

21:40.612 --> 21:42.671
Come here. Hey. Hey.

21:42.847 --> 21:44.940
Good job. You did so good.

21:45.116 --> 21:47.914
Yes. Yes.

22:41.839 --> 22:43.272
Ah.

22:46.511 --> 22:49.605
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

22:49.781 --> 22:53.012
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

22:53.184 --> 22:55.175
You'll get some of that later.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.901
Let's go.

23:25.717 --> 23:27.241
Wait.

Fore!

25:17.328 --> 25:19.296
Yeah.

25:24.235 --> 25:26.795
Keep your eye on this one for me.

25:30.274 --> 25:31.332
Ooh.

25:36.747 --> 25:38.942

31:16.520 --> 31:18.852
Sam, get out! Get out!

32:16.714 --> 32:20.673
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.478
Listen, uh...

32:23.587 --> 32:26.579
...I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

32:28.993 --> 32:31.723
Because you can still get infected.

32:32.529 --> 32:34.326
And I can't.

32:51.181 --> 32:54.309
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

32:57.621 --> 32:59.418
...just go.

34:30.614 --> 34:35.949

Nonreactive to light.

35:12.623 --> 35:14.989
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

35:15.159 --> 35:20.859

Commencing human trials.

35:56.099 --> 35:57.532
Respiration slowing.

35:59.136 --> 36:02.731
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

36:03.407 --> 36:05.432
...105...

36:05.609 --> 36:08.100
...104 and decreasing.

36:10.514 --> 36:12.175
We may have something here.

36:57.861 --> 37:03.800
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

37:22.452 --> 37:27.116
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

37:27.291 --> 37:29.282
Still no cure.

37:46.143 --> 37:48.703
<i>Day 1001.</i>

37:48.879 --> 37:52.007
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

37:52.182 --> 37:55.913
<i>Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

37:56.386 --> 37:58.854
...and contact strains.

37:59.022 --> 38:03.891
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

38:05.963 --> 38:09.228
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

38:11.602 --> 38:13.035
Vaccine trials continue.

38:13.203 --> 38:17.264
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

38:17.441 --> 38:20.706
The Krippin Virus is...

38:20.877 --> 38:22.868
...elegant.

38:27.918 --> 38:31.046
Just fishing in the dark, son.

38:33.991 --> 38:37.927
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

38:38.929 --> 38:43.423
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

38:45.068 --> 38:48.401
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

38:48.572 --> 38:53.669
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

38:54.845 --> 38:58.781
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

39:01.518 --> 39:05.147
Social de-evolution appears complete.

39:05.656 --> 39:10.593
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

39:17.467 --> 39:18.957
Why are we stopping?

39:23.407 --> 39:25.466
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

39:25.642 --> 39:28.907
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.

39:32.549 --> 39:34.517
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
Daddy!

39:34.685 --> 39:37.017
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

39:37.487 --> 39:40.854
Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

39:41.024 --> 39:42.423
Mommy, they have guns!

39:42.592 --> 39:44.583
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

39:44.761 --> 39:46.854
<i>Unless you have clearance...</i>

39:47.030 --> 39:50.431
<i>... you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.</i>

39:50.600 --> 39:54.001
Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!

39:59.609 --> 40:01.634
Coming through!

40:33.176 --> 40:36.634
<i>Unless you have clearance,
you cannot pass the checkpoint.</i>

40:36.813 --> 40:38.872
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

40:44.654 --> 40:46.918
You're clear. Move ahead.

40:47.357 --> 40:48.381
You're clear.

40:48.825 --> 40:51.123
All right, that's it, move up.

40:51.962 --> 40:53.691
All right, step up.

40:54.164 --> 40:56.428
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

40:57.667 --> 40:59.100
No good.

40:59.269 --> 41:02.295
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

41:03.840 --> 41:05.398
Come on, step back.

41:05.575 --> 41:08.408
<i>- Military quarantine is about to begin.
- Look, look, look.</i>

41:08.578 --> 41:10.512
I'm not infected.
Clear. Good, go on.

41:10.680 --> 41:11.806
I'm not infected.

41:12.015 --> 41:13.414
Please! Please!

41:13.583 --> 41:17.314
- Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
You're gonna have to move back.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.856
- No good.
Follow me, ma'am.

41:21.024 --> 41:24.357
What? No! Robert! Robert!

41:24.528 --> 41:26.723
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.

41:26.897 --> 41:29.263
- Mommy!
Stand down.

41:29.432 --> 41:30.456
Lieutenant...

41:30.634 --> 41:33.296
- Mommy!
- Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

41:33.470 --> 41:34.937
Get your hands off of my wife.

41:35.105 --> 41:37.437
Stand down!
- Scan her again. Stand down!

41:37.607 --> 41:40.201
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

41:40.377 --> 41:43.972
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

41:44.147 --> 41:45.842
Scan her again!

41:49.386 --> 41:51.445
All right, scan her again.

41:54.457 --> 41:57.255
- It's clear.
- It's clear. Move through.

41:59.629 --> 42:00.789
Who's next? Come on.

42:00.964 --> 42:03.865
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!

42:04.034 --> 42:07.231
- Mommy!
- Please take my baby. Please!

42:08.672 --> 42:12.438
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

42:12.976 --> 42:15.171
<i>Stay away from the shoreline.</i>

42:15.345 --> 42:17.006
How long?

42:17.514 --> 42:19.448
Five minutes. We'll make it.

42:19.616 --> 42:22.779
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

42:23.353 --> 42:26.516
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

42:38.602 --> 42:43.596
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.

42:48.511 --> 42:50.103
Give me a kiss.

43:00.590 --> 43:03.252
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

43:03.960 --> 43:06.827
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

43:06.997 --> 43:09.329
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

43:09.499 --> 43:13.526
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

43:15.071 --> 43:17.539
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

43:17.707 --> 43:20.005
Sam, you protect Daddy.

43:20.176 --> 43:24.135
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
Sir, we gotta go!

43:26.883 --> 43:30.250
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

43:30.887 --> 43:33.151
<i>It's a butterfly.</i>

43:35.659 --> 43:37.718
All right, come on, let's go!

44:23.937 --> 44:25.461
How'd you sleep?

44:25.639 --> 44:28.767
<i>Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...</i>

44:28.942 --> 44:33.845
<i>... of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.</i>

44:34.014 --> 44:38.144
<i>So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...</i>

44:38.318 --> 44:42.152
<i>... have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

44:42.322 --> 44:45.120
<i>Twenty-five patients have already died.</i>

44:45.292 --> 44:49.490
<i>Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...</i>

44:49.663 --> 44:52.598
<i>... and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.</i>

44:52.766 --> 44:54.324
It's my birthday.

44:54.501 --> 44:57.868
<i>We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these...</i>

44:58.038 --> 44:59.733
You gonna sing?

45:00.674 --> 45:03.108
<i>My name is Robert Neville.</i>

45:03.643 --> 45:06.840
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

45:08.848 --> 45:12.579
<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

45:13.220 --> 45:16.849
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...</i>

45:17.023 --> 45:19.856
<i>... when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

45:21.027 --> 45:26.090
<i>If you are out there,
if anyone is out there...</i>

45:26.266 --> 45:30.464
<i>I can provide food. I can provide shelter.</i>

45:30.637 --> 45:33.367
<i>I can provide security.</i>

45:33.540 --> 45:37.032
<i>If there's anybody out there, anybody...</i>

45:39.379 --> 45:41.176
<i>Please.</i>

45:41.781 --> 45:43.772
<i>You are not alone.</i>

45:44.784 --> 45:46.376
Listen, uh...

45:46.553 --> 45:49.920
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

45:50.223 --> 45:52.987
Okay? Because you know
I don't like surprises.

45:53.159 --> 45:56.754
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

46:26.760 --> 46:28.523
Hey! Hey!

46:41.641 --> 46:44.735
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

46:47.314 --> 46:50.442
What the...? What the hell are you...?
No!

46:50.917 --> 46:53.317
No! No!

46:55.522 --> 46:56.853
No.

46:57.023 --> 46:59.890
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

47:00.260 --> 47:02.524
How did you get out here?!

47:02.696 --> 47:05.859
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

47:06.032 --> 47:09.468
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

47:22.449 --> 47:24.576
Damn it, Fred!

47:25.118 --> 47:27.109
Damn it!

49:27.607 --> 49:31.008
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

49:56.836 --> 49:59.703
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

50:25.064 --> 50:27.692
Baby. I'm okay.

50:28.635 --> 50:31.798
I'm okay. I'm okay.

51:49.415 --> 51:51.178
Let's go.

51:51.351 --> 51:54.286
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

52:06.733 --> 52:07.825
Let's go! Sam!

52:18.111 --> 52:19.874
No! No! Let's go!

52:20.046 --> 52:22.776
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

52:51.577 --> 52:53.010
Sam!

52:59.419 --> 53:01.284
No!

53:24.977 --> 53:27.377
Sam? Sam?

53:30.149 --> 53:31.514
It's okay.

53:31.684 --> 53:34.744
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

53:34.921 --> 53:37.412
You're all right. You're all right.

53:37.824 --> 53:40.554
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

53:40.727 --> 53:44.959
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

53:45.131 --> 53:48.294
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you... Gotta take you home.

53:48.468 --> 53:51.028
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

53:51.204 --> 53:53.672
Come here. Come here. Come here.

54:28.574 --> 54:30.132
Come on. Come here. Come here.

54:30.409 --> 54:32.741
I got you. I got you.

54:39.752 --> 54:41.481
It's okay.

54:42.388 --> 54:44.117
You're okay.

54:52.198 --> 54:53.927
<i>Don't worry</i>

54:56.135 --> 54:58.262
<i>About a thing</i>

54:59.305 --> 55:04.470
<i>'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

55:07.947 --> 55:13.579
<i>Don't worry
About a thing</i>

55:18.391 --> 55:20.825
<i>Rise up this morning</i>

55:22.461 --> 55:25.055
<i>Smiled with the rising sun</i>

55:31.370 --> 55:33.395
<i>Three little birds</i>

58:36.622 --> 58:39.056
I promised my friend...

58:40.693 --> 58:45.858
...that I would say hello to you today.

58:50.536 --> 58:52.265
Hello.

59:00.012 --> 59:01.707
Hello.

59:12.191 --> 59:14.989
Please say hello to me.

59:21.867 --> 59:24.631
Please say hello to me.

01:00:45.117 --> 01:00:46.675
Die!

01:00:46.986 --> 01:00:48.078
Die!

01:01:02.101 --> 01:01:03.830
Die!

01:02:43.769 --> 01:02:47.170
Come on! Stay with me!

01:02:48.707 --> 01:02:51.267
Where do you live?

01:02:53.112 --> 01:02:54.977
Hey.

01:02:55.447 --> 01:02:56.971
Hey!

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:59.276
Stay with me.

01:03:00.185 --> 01:03:02.449
Where do you live?

01:03:05.424 --> 01:03:07.949
Where do you live?

01:03:08.727 --> 01:03:09.955
Uh...

01:03:10.129 --> 01:03:14.327
11 Washington Square.

01:03:14.867 --> 01:03:17.597
They don't know where I live.

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:21.962
Don't... Don't let them track us.

01:03:22.408 --> 01:03:24.933
You gotta stay out till dawn.

01:04:28.807 --> 01:04:29.796
No!

01:04:31.377 --> 01:04:33.311
<i>Donkey?</i>

01:04:34.279 --> 01:04:35.371
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:04:35.547 --> 01:04:38.880
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

01:04:39.051 --> 01:04:43.818
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

01:04:43.989 --> 01:04:46.958
<i>It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

01:04:47.126 --> 01:04:50.687
<i>Oh, your half? Hm.
Yes, my half.</i>

01:04:50.863 --> 01:04:54.492
<i>I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.</i>

01:04:54.666 --> 01:04:58.033
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

01:04:58.203 --> 01:05:00.330
<i>Back off!
No, you back off.</i>

01:05:00.506 --> 01:05:02.565
<i>This is my swamp!
Our swamp.</i>

01:05:05.411 --> 01:05:08.209
<i>- Smelly ogre.
Fine!</i>

01:05:08.914 --> 01:05:10.643
<i>Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

01:05:10.816 --> 01:05:12.306
<i>Well, I'm through with you.</i>

01:05:12.484 --> 01:05:15.578
<i>You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."</i>

01:05:15.754 --> 01:05:20.817
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

01:05:20.993 --> 01:05:25.157
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:27.730
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.</i>

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.269
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

01:05:32.438 --> 01:05:35.601
<i>Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.669
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:05:37.843 --> 01:05:40.175
<i>You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...</i>

01:05:40.345 --> 01:05:41.812
<i>... for stabbing me in the back!</i>

01:05:45.184 --> 01:05:48.676
<i>You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

01:05:48.854 --> 01:05:50.014
<i>Go away.
See?</i>

01:05:50.189 --> 01:05:52.316
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:54.686
<i>... and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:59.320
<i>Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:01.125
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:06.135
<i>She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.648
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

01:06:17.816 --> 01:06:19.841
Obviously you know that.

01:06:20.719 --> 01:06:21.913
They're yours.

01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:27.081
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:31.059
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:33.596
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

01:06:33.765 --> 01:06:37.963
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:41.068
Who are you?

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:45.101
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

01:06:52.184 --> 01:06:54.311
Don't let it get cold.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.996
It's okay. Go on.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.256
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

01:07:39.965 --> 01:07:43.025
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

01:07:45.003 --> 01:07:47.471
We're going to Vermont.

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.802
To the survivors' colony.

01:07:51.376 --> 01:07:52.968
What?

01:07:53.912 --> 01:07:57.541
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

01:07:57.716 --> 01:08:00.184
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

01:08:00.352 --> 01:08:02.377
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

01:08:02.554 --> 01:08:04.454
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:09.219
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

01:08:09.394 --> 01:08:11.919
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony...

01:08:12.097 --> 01:08:14.327
Shut up! Shut up!

01:08:14.499 --> 01:08:15.932
Everybody's dead.

01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:18.227
Everybody is dead.

01:08:26.178 --> 01:08:29.272
I just need...
I need a minute. Okay?

01:08:30.881 --> 01:08:32.406
Just...

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:39.221
I just... I was saving that bacon.

01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:42.089
I was saving it.

01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:47.398
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just...

01:08:47.566 --> 01:08:49.591
I'm gonna go.

01:09:07.719 --> 01:09:10.346
Ethan, put the knife down.

01:09:45.357 --> 01:09:49.292
<i>You there! Ogre.
Aye.</i>

01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:51.622
<i>By the order of Lord Farquaad...</i>

01:09:51.796 --> 01:09:54.197
<i>... I am authorized
to place you both under arrest...</i>

01:09:54.366 --> 01:10:00.168
<i>... and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.</i>

01:10:00.338 --> 01:10:04.707
<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

01:10:15.987 --> 01:10:17.648
Can I say something to you?

01:10:17.823 --> 01:10:20.815
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:23.184
Are you talking to...

01:10:24.329 --> 01:10:25.353
...me?

01:10:26.798 --> 01:10:30.029
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

01:10:30.202 --> 01:10:33.433
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!

01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:35.869
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:38.066
That really made me
feel good to see that.

01:10:38.243 --> 01:10:40.438
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

01:10:40.912 --> 01:10:44.746
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

01:10:44.916 --> 01:10:46.406
Hm?

01:10:46.585 --> 01:10:48.018
But, uh...

01:10:48.253 --> 01:10:49.811
...I don't have any friends.

01:10:49.988 --> 01:10:52.456
And I'm not going out there by myself.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:55.252
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

01:10:55.427 --> 01:10:57.190
<i>You a mean, green fighting machine.</i>

01:10:57.362 --> 01:11:00.456
<i>Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.</i>

01:11:03.702 --> 01:11:04.964
<i>I like Shrek.</i>

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:07.571
<i>That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...</i>

01:11:07.739 --> 01:11:10.469
<i>... if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...</i>

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:14.578
<i>... because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!</i>

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.207
<i>Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...</i>

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:24.314
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:32.286
Thank you for my leg.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.563
Okay.

01:11:39.638 --> 01:11:41.162
Where have you been?

01:11:41.406 --> 01:11:44.967
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of Sao Paulo.

01:11:45.143 --> 01:11:48.237
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

01:11:48.413 --> 01:11:49.971
No, they weren't.

01:11:50.148 --> 01:11:53.140
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

01:11:53.318 --> 01:11:57.084
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

01:11:57.255 --> 01:11:58.916
You said five?

01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:01.957
The Darkseekers got them.

01:12:04.329 --> 01:12:06.957
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

01:12:15.807 --> 01:12:17.172
It's too late today.

01:12:17.342 --> 01:12:20.470
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

01:12:20.645 --> 01:12:23.113
- So if you had...
- I'm not leaving.

01:12:23.982 --> 01:12:26.314
This is ground zero.

01:12:27.752 --> 01:12:29.913
This is my site.

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:34.047
I'm not gonna let this happen.

01:12:36.228 --> 01:12:38.526
I can still fix this.

01:12:51.343 --> 01:12:56.007
Whoa. You scared me.
- Sorry.

01:12:56.181 --> 01:12:57.512
I called down twice.

01:12:57.682 --> 01:13:00.344
Oh. Oh, thank you.

01:13:05.023 --> 01:13:08.618
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

01:13:08.793 --> 01:13:11.523
I've never seen one so still.

01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:14.826
They're always biting.

01:13:18.837 --> 01:13:21.169
You think that can cure her?

01:13:21.339 --> 01:13:24.274
Um... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:27.673
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

01:13:27.846 --> 01:13:30.838
...I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

01:13:42.127 --> 01:13:44.425
Did all of them die?

01:13:44.663 --> 01:13:46.221
Yes.

01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:51.292
My God.

01:13:52.137 --> 01:13:55.868
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

01:14:01.212 --> 01:14:03.544
Where can Ethan sleep?

01:14:22.233 --> 01:14:24.098
He's heavy.

01:14:30.608 --> 01:14:32.405
Can you get that?

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:06.507
She's beautiful.

01:15:06.978 --> 01:15:08.878
What's her name?

01:15:10.582 --> 01:15:12.482
Marley.

01:15:13.752 --> 01:15:17.313
- Her name was Marley.
- It's a beautiful name.

01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:23.251
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

01:15:23.428 --> 01:15:26.761
- Who?
- Uh, the singer.

01:15:27.799 --> 01:15:29.528
Damian?

01:15:30.802 --> 01:15:32.827
Uh, his father.

01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:38.371
His father.

01:15:39.444 --> 01:15:40.570
Nope.

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:42.838
<i>I shot the sheriff</i>

01:15:46.151 --> 01:15:49.120
<i>But I didn't shoot the deputy</i>

01:15:56.628 --> 01:16:01.656
- Oh, that is unacceptable.
- What?

01:16:06.304 --> 01:16:08.795
Best album ever made.

01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:21.209
- You don't recognize that?
- Mm-mm.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.748
Wow.

01:16:25.924 --> 01:16:31.487
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

01:16:31.663 --> 01:16:36.293
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

01:16:36.468 --> 01:16:42.600
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

01:16:43.441 --> 01:16:47.309
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

01:16:47.479 --> 01:16:51.438
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

01:16:53.284 --> 01:16:54.615
Two days later...

01:16:55.253 --> 01:16:58.882
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

01:17:00.692 --> 01:17:03.092
Somebody asked him why.

01:17:04.896 --> 01:17:07.364
He said, "The people...

01:17:07.532 --> 01:17:12.595
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

01:17:13.771 --> 01:17:15.762
How can I?"

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:21.676
Light up the darkness.

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.935
Come with us, Neville.

01:17:50.508 --> 01:17:52.533
To the colony.

01:17:56.247 --> 01:17:58.681
There's no colony, Anna.

01:18:02.987 --> 01:18:04.511
Everything just fell apart.

01:18:04.689 --> 01:18:08.386
- There was no evacuation plan...
- You're wrong. There is a colony.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.985
I know, okay?

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:13.658
How do you know, Anna?

01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:21.229
I just know.

01:18:23.508 --> 01:18:27.638
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

01:18:29.347 --> 01:18:30.678
God told me.

01:18:31.182 --> 01:18:33.173
He has a plan.

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.513
- God told you?
- Yes.

01:18:37.689 --> 01:18:40.419
- The God?
- Yes.

01:18:41.993 --> 01:18:44.427
- I know how this sounds.
- It sounds crazy.

01:18:44.596 --> 01:18:48.396
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

01:18:48.566 --> 01:18:50.193
Something told me to come here.

01:18:50.368 --> 01:18:53.166
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

01:18:53.338 --> 01:18:55.363
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:56.529
Anna.

01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:59.871
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

01:19:00.044 --> 01:19:03.673
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.

01:19:04.849 --> 01:19:07.875
Neville, the world is quieter now.

01:19:08.052 --> 01:19:10.111
You just have to listen.

01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:12.449
If we listen...

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:15.092
...we can hear God's plan.

01:19:15.293 --> 01:19:17.318
- God's plan?
- Yeah.

01:19:17.495 --> 01:19:20.055
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

01:19:20.231 --> 01:19:23.132
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:27.897
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

01:19:28.072 --> 01:19:30.540
...people dead.

01:19:30.708 --> 01:19:33.541
Crashed and bled out, dead.

01:19:33.711 --> 01:19:35.576
Less than 1 percent immunity.

01:19:35.747 --> 01:19:39.547
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

01:19:39.717 --> 01:19:43.847
The other 588 million...

01:19:44.022 --> 01:19:46.013
...turned into your Darkseekers.

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.885
And then they got hungry.

01:19:48.059 --> 01:19:52.462
And they killed and fed on everybody.

01:19:53.631 --> 01:19:55.724
Everybody!

01:19:56.434 --> 01:20:01.394
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

01:20:01.572 --> 01:20:03.506
...is dead!

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:07.743
Dead!

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.810
There is no God. There is no God.

01:20:17.121 --> 01:20:18.952
What is that?

01:20:22.293 --> 01:20:25.626
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

01:20:25.797 --> 01:20:28.891
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

01:20:30.468 --> 01:20:33.198
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

01:20:40.478 --> 01:20:41.911
They followed us home.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.741
Ethan.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.588
Shit.

01:21:44.308 --> 01:21:45.935
Anna.

01:21:47.478 --> 01:21:49.275
Anna.

01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:55.678
Anna!

01:22:07.298 --> 01:22:09.232
Anna!

01:22:12.637 --> 01:22:14.229
Anna!

01:24:00.678 --> 01:24:02.305
Anna?

01:24:06.284 --> 01:24:08.013
Anna.

01:25:05.876 --> 01:25:08.071
Come on. Come on.

01:25:09.113 --> 01:25:11.081
- Are you okay? You all right?
Yeah.

01:25:11.248 --> 01:25:12.772
Are you all right?

01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:15.544
- You okay?
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.794
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

01:25:32.069 --> 01:25:34.867
Get to the lab! To the lab!

01:25:44.215 --> 01:25:45.239
Get behind the Plexi.

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.744
Oh, my God. Come on.

01:26:00.331 --> 01:26:02.094
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

01:26:03.901 --> 01:26:05.664
Oh, my God.

01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:20.140
It's working.

01:26:24.488 --> 01:26:25.853
Neville...

01:26:27.158 --> 01:26:28.955
...it's working.

01:26:34.265 --> 01:26:36.062
No! Stop! Stop!

01:26:37.368 --> 01:26:39.666
Look, look, look, I can save you.

01:26:39.837 --> 01:26:43.295
I can sa... I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.378
I can... I can fix this!

01:26:48.546 --> 01:26:50.070
I can save everybody!

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:53.478
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:58.154
Stop! Stop!

01:27:04.295 --> 01:27:07.731
Let me save you! Let me save you!

01:27:07.898 --> 01:27:08.887
No, no!

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:21.041
No, no!

01:27:37.962 --> 01:27:40.192
<i>Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.</i>

01:28:06.357 --> 01:28:07.915
Robert.

01:28:08.225 --> 01:28:10.955
- What are you doing?
- The cure is in her blood.

01:28:15.499 --> 01:28:17.967
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe.
Ethan, get in!

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:19.734
- Go.
- Come on, get in.

01:28:19.904 --> 01:28:21.769
- Get in.
- Anna.

01:28:25.442 --> 01:28:27.876
I think this is why you're here.

01:28:30.948 --> 01:28:32.643
What are you doing?

01:28:32.817 --> 01:28:34.876
I'm listening.

01:28:35.486 --> 01:28:37.317
- Neville, there's room. Come!
- No.

01:28:37.488 --> 01:28:40.457
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.691
Stay in till dawn.

01:31:03.233 --> 01:31:07.966
<i>In 2009, a deadly virus
