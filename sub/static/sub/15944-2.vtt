PAUL SABINE: The world
thinks Paris is finished,

00:06.067 --> 00:10.327
and the richest man in France
wants me to change
that opinion.

00:10.367 --> 00:13.197
-(THEY LAUGH)
-Whoo-hoo!

00:13.233 --> 00:16.573
-Who gave you
permission to do this?
-Look, you said it yourself.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.030
The right dress can transform
the person wearing it.

00:19.067 --> 00:22.367
-I think it can transform
the person looking at it too.
-(SHUTTER CLICKS)

00:22.400 --> 00:24.300
What do you gotta do
to get a gift like that?

00:24.333 --> 00:27.403
Aren't you curious
what this guy was up to

00:27.433 --> 00:28.673
three years ago?

00:28.700 --> 00:29.830
(THUD)

00:29.867 --> 00:32.667
Was it your choice or
your mother's to give it up?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.170
I just wanted to go back.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.070
They didn't even let me
hold him.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.500
Once Trouvier's investment
throws a spotlight
on this business--

00:39.533 --> 00:41.003
PAUL: Claude doesn't want
to be in that spotlight.

00:41.033 --> 00:42.673
HELEN: You ignore
his reckless behaviour,

00:42.700 --> 00:45.270
so long as there's
a new sketch in the morning.

00:46.367 --> 00:48.397
-You need this as much as me.
-(COUGHS)

00:48.433 --> 00:50.233
-Get to work!
-This was meant to scare him,

00:50.267 --> 00:52.597
just enough to keep him
home... working!

00:52.633 --> 00:55.173
What did you ask
that animal to do?

00:58.033 --> 00:59.303
(SOBS)

00:59.333 --> 01:01.103
MOTHER: I don't want
to know about him.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.973
CLAUDE: You should.
He knows all about us.

01:04.066 --> 01:07.297
-Meaning?
-He was interested in me.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.433
MOTHER: And what did you
tell him? Claude...

01:12.267 --> 01:13.267
Claude?

01:13.300 --> 01:15.300
What did you tell him?

01:17.600 --> 01:20.070
* I love Paris

01:20.067 --> 01:22.597
* In the springtime

01:24.467 --> 01:26.467
* I love Paris

01:26.500 --> 01:29.570
* In the fall

01:30.833 --> 01:32.503
* I love Paris

01:32.533 --> 01:35.403
* In the winter
when it drizzles *

01:36.733 --> 01:38.933
* Say, I love Paris

01:38.967 --> 01:41.627
* In the summer
when it sizzles *

01:41.667 --> 01:44.227
* I love Paris

01:44.267 --> 01:47.897
* Why, oh, why
do I love Paris? *

01:47.933 --> 01:50.073
* Because my love

01:50.100 --> 01:52.070
* Is near

Juliette?

02:06.100 --> 02:09.330
Nina?
What are you doing here?

02:10.433 --> 02:11.433
Nina?

02:11.467 --> 02:13.127
Somebody told Monsieur
you were in London.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.067
-I never went.
-Then where have you been?

02:17.533 --> 02:20.473
Your mother's in a terrible
state. You have to call her.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.770
-I can't.
-She hasn't slept.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.400
She doesn't eat.
Everyone runs when she
reaches for the scissors.

02:26.433 --> 02:27.533
Give her this.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.597
There's a note
sewn inside the lining

02:29.633 --> 02:31.473
and the money I took.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.700
She needs to see you,
not a note.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.097
Nina?

02:37.133 --> 02:39.073
Let me help you.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.130
Have you spoken to him,
the boy from school?

02:43.167 --> 02:46.097
I just want her to know
that I'm--

02:46.133 --> 02:48.873
You're what?

02:48.900 --> 02:51.570
If you didn't come back
for your mother, then who?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.430
Hm?

02:58.733 --> 03:00.633
BILLY: Wider.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.527
That's great. Perfect. Yeah.

03:03.567 --> 03:05.397
I think this one's good.

03:05.433 --> 03:07.203
(SHUTTER CLICKS)

03:09.067 --> 03:10.597
Could you tilt your head
back slightly?

03:10.633 --> 03:12.703
That's great.
There. That's great.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.597
Any idea when this will end?

03:17.633 --> 03:20.473
When he asks us to put on
the dresses! (CHUCKLES)

03:22.067 --> 03:24.227
All right..

03:26.067 --> 03:28.427
Billy, we need to finish
before the others arrive.

03:28.467 --> 03:31.097
We are almost there.
The arm.

03:31.133 --> 03:34.073
This is a press release,
not a peace treaty.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.567
True.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.670
Imagine how many more
history books would sell

03:37.700 --> 03:40.200
if beautiful women
were on the covers.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.403
That's great. It's great.

03:50.700 --> 03:54.170
Monsieur Sabine, can you just
cheat a little to the left?

03:55.067 --> 03:57.067
That's it.

03:57.067 --> 03:59.067
That's it. Perfect.

03:59.067 --> 04:01.467
-(SHUTTER CLICKS)
-All right.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.200
Gentlemen, can we just
have the hint of a smile?

04:30.367 --> 04:33.367
I haven't seen you
since the other night and...

04:33.400 --> 04:36.200
I've been at the hospital
with Claude.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.470
-What do you need?
-Nothing.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.773
I just wanted
to let you know...

04:45.067 --> 04:47.427
...it was taken care of.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.930
Where's my son?

04:52.967 --> 04:56.727
Downstairs
with Monsieur Trouvier,
posing for the announcement.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.930
-I had to use the ha--
-I don't need to know
any more about it, Victor.

Paul had your maid in
to tidy up a bit.

05:43.267 --> 05:45.697
-Here. You can rest.
-All right, Helen.

05:45.733 --> 05:48.173
You can stop playing nurse.
Your hands aren't
cold enough.

-Where's my cat?
-Landlady has him.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.733
Has him or ate him?

05:52.767 --> 05:55.127
Well, evidently, he was
making quite a racket,

05:55.167 --> 05:56.797
while you were
in the hospital.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.273
(GROANS) Well...

05:59.300 --> 06:01.430
he saw what put me in there.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.870
Word's already leaked
about the Trouvier deal.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.730
Everyone's buzzing
about the new collection.

If he'd wanted to take
my wristwatch,

06:34.067 --> 06:38.427
why didn't he just take it
the first night he met me?

06:38.467 --> 06:42.067
Maybe he was desperate,
wanted to sell it
for fast cash.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.203
He wasn't desperate.

06:45.233 --> 06:48.633
Then maybe he just...
wanted a smart wristwatch.

06:50.367 --> 06:53.097
You're the one
who always says...

06:53.133 --> 06:56.233
...good taste happens
to bad people.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.130
He spent so many nights
in my bed.

07:05.367 --> 07:08.367
He also left you bloodied on
the floor of your bathroom.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.967
I'm er... curious.

07:30.067 --> 07:32.867
Did you interview
any local photographers?

07:32.900 --> 07:37.170
I didn't. They tend
to deliver what's expected.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.970
Billy has something else, hm?

07:39.067 --> 07:41.197
An American passport?

07:41.233 --> 07:44.103
Outsiders can often see
what we can't, Jules.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.073
Have you spent time
in New York?

07:46.067 --> 07:48.127
No. Never been there.

07:48.167 --> 07:52.227
I see enough Americans
these days in our streets.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.227
And I question training
someone who can take

07:54.267 --> 07:58.327
-everything he's learned from
us to our chief competitor.
-I suppose that's a risk.

07:58.367 --> 08:01.367
But perhaps
Billy could train us.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.200
Is that so? Hm?

08:04.233 --> 08:07.533
Well, chewing gum
makes my teeth itch.

08:07.567 --> 08:09.527
And I'm not looking forward
to the second occupation.

08:09.567 --> 08:15.197
I hear your concern, but
I think this young man brings
something fresh to the table.

08:15.233 --> 08:18.073
Spirit of romance, hope...

08:18.067 --> 08:19.767
Better days to come.

08:22.967 --> 08:25.927
You know, last summer,

08:25.967 --> 08:30.267
I took my grandson fishing.
(CHUCKLES)

08:30.300 --> 08:36.200
One morning we saw a heron
swoop down and catch an eel.

08:36.232 --> 08:40.433
It was too big for him,
yet he wouldn't let go.

08:40.467 --> 08:44.427
Instead he circled the lake,
slamming himself
into the water,

08:44.467 --> 08:46.327
trying to swallow
the damn thing.

08:46.367 --> 08:49.597
Now, this eel was halfway
down the bird's throat,

08:49.633 --> 08:51.973
yet he continued
to pull himself out.

08:52.067 --> 08:54.767
They were locked
in a battle...

08:55.933 --> 08:57.803
that would kill them both,

08:57.833 --> 08:59.573
unclear...

08:59.600 --> 09:01.770
of what
they'd got themselves into.

09:02.767 --> 09:04.367
(CHUCKLES)

09:07.700 --> 09:09.600
There are many ways...

09:10.467 --> 09:13.597
...to achieve the same goal,
son.

09:13.633 --> 09:18.233
There's nothing wrong
in doing what is expected.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.333
You're back?

09:44.233 --> 09:46.673
Don't tell me
I gave you the wrong key.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.470
I never used it.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
Hold on to it. I'm not gonna
need it for a while.

09:52.533 --> 09:56.873
Rossi left Paris
and Monsieur Sabine
took me off the market.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.930
-What happened to
Life magazine?
-They killed their story.

09:58.967 --> 10:01.227
Once Monsieur saw those
pictures of you, though, he--

10:01.267 --> 10:02.967
-You showed him those?
-He wasn't angry.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.730
You told me they were for
you! Has my mother seen them?

10:05.767 --> 10:07.497
-Nina!
-I only showed them
to Monsieur, honestly.

10:07.533 --> 10:09.673
-I figured you were halfway
across the Channel.
-Nina.

10:10.933 --> 10:12.703
Are you back
or just visiting?

10:12.733 --> 10:14.533
I'm here to see my mother.

10:14.567 --> 10:16.897
Monsieur would like
to speak to you...

10:16.933 --> 10:18.703
in his office.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.703
He only asked for Nina.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.667
Am I asking too much?

10:32.667 --> 10:35.297
I don't understand, monsieur.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.873
I'm proposing
that you do it again.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.470
This time,
I'll pick the garments.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.130
But I'm not a model.
Why not--

10:41.167 --> 10:43.497
You're no longer
the little girl
sitting at Marianne's feet

10:43.533 --> 10:46.473
making dolls out of spools.
You've grown up.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.530
-You might want
something more.
-I don't.

10:49.567 --> 10:53.127
You must. Why else would
you have put on that dress?

10:57.367 --> 10:59.727
Marianne?

10:59.767 --> 11:02.667
Would you allow your daughter
to model for the house?

11:02.700 --> 11:07.800
I'd like her to wear
some of the pieces we edited
from the first collection.

11:09.467 --> 11:12.267
Billy could shoot her
in various locations...

11:12.300 --> 11:14.200
outside.

11:14.233 --> 11:16.173
-You mean the streets?
-Hm.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.700
He's... inspired.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.303
And now that we have a new
partner in this business,

11:21.333 --> 11:23.403
I think Monsieur Trouvier
should be treated

11:23.433 --> 11:26.073
to something
bold and unexpected.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.727
-Don't you agree?
-Mm.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.503
(DOOR SHUTS)

11:50.133 --> 11:51.933
Why would he want me
to do this?

11:51.967 --> 11:53.827
Maybe it's his way of
keeping you here.

11:53.867 --> 11:56.067
I can't seem to.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.697
Why don't you put on a smock?

12:07.733 --> 12:09.473
I could use your help.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.897
What are you doing...
What are you doing here?

12:28.933 --> 12:30.603
-Sh!
-How did you get in?

12:30.633 --> 12:33.073
I didn't like the way
we ended things.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.403
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

12:38.067 --> 12:40.227
You know, you really
messed up my arm, mate.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.303
Made it hard
to slip on my watch.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.170
I'm sorry - it's your watch.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.670
Here, take it back.
It's too flashy for me.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.503
-This one's clever.
-Put it down.

-How much would this fetch?
-Why do you care?

13:01.267 --> 13:04.067
Tell me, what do they shell
out for one of these frocks?

13:04.067 --> 13:06.067
Lots.

13:06.900 --> 13:10.070
-I need a number.
-Why?

13:11.067 --> 13:12.797
They don't care.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.603
It's just pocket change
to them.

13:16.433 --> 13:18.633
I could live in
one of those pockets.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.227
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

13:20.267 --> 13:22.427
Do they wear it
more than once?

13:23.700 --> 13:27.570
-No.
-So you spend your days
drawing these...

13:28.633 --> 13:30.433
...for people like that.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.667
But you spend your nights...

13:34.667 --> 13:37.067
...meeting people like me.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.467
Under the bridge.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.700
Which is it, mate?

13:47.167 --> 13:49.367

13:50.600 --> 13:52.330
...or the night?

28:40.767 --> 28:42.967
They attacked her. I didn't
know that was gonna happen.

28:43.067 --> 28:45.067
I turn my back
for one second, and...

28:45.067 --> 28:47.227
Honestly, I didn't think
this could happen.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.697
-I'm sorry.
-I'll speak to her.

28:49.733 --> 28:52.933
-Is everything all right?
-There was an incident
with Nina.

28:52.967 --> 28:54.897
-A fight in the street.
-Poor thing.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.703
-Is she OK?
-Yes.

28:56.733 --> 28:59.403
Would you like to wait for
Marianne or should I fetch
an assistant?

28:59.433 --> 29:01.633
Oh, no, this can wait.
Thank you.

29:02.733 --> 29:04.533
Thank you.

29:13.600 --> 29:18.070
Monsieur Trouvier
may have been right
about this American boy.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.100
Not everyone
has your good sense, Helen.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.973
Or the skill to read
a tricky situation.

29:23.067 --> 29:28.197
-If you're asking me
to speak to Billy...
-No, no. No, I'm not.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.433
You're already involved
in so much.

29:30.467 --> 29:32.497
Far too much.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.397
It's a lovely shape on you.

29:37.433 --> 29:39.073
Thank you.

29:39.067 --> 29:41.067
Would you excuse me,
while I get dressed?

29:41.100 --> 29:43.770
Paul showed me "paradise"
this morning.

29:44.767 --> 29:46.327
Very charming.

29:46.367 --> 29:49.097
Was that your idea? To stick
me in a chicken coop?

29:51.300 --> 29:55.100
If you believe for a moment
that I'm about to trade Paris
for knitting mittens,

29:55.133 --> 29:57.073
you've placed a sorry bet.

29:57.067 --> 29:58.797
I'm not going to disappear,
Helen.

29:58.833 --> 30:03.373
I need to be here with
my sons, looking after them,
just as I always have.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.170
-(DOOR OPENS)
-Madame?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.500
Ask Victor to take me home,
please.

30:08.533 --> 30:10.433
I believe he's offered
to drive Marianne.

30:10.467 --> 30:12.267
But if you wish to ride
with them...

30:12.300 --> 30:14.700
If I'd wanted to make stops,
I'd take a bus.

30:14.733 --> 30:16.733
Fetch me a taxi.

30:23.267 --> 30:25.327
(PHONE NUMBER BEING DIALLED)

30:29.333 --> 30:32.303
500 hours of needlework,
cutting, fittings,

30:32.333 --> 30:34.673
and it's destroyed
in 30 seconds.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.300
Fuck the dress. It's thread.

30:36.333 --> 30:39.233
-How's Nina?
-I haven't spoken to her yet.

30:39.267 --> 30:41.567
I sent Marianne home
to take care of her.

30:42.567 --> 30:44.127
What are you looking for?

30:44.167 --> 30:47.627
Odile never piles my stuff up
like this.

30:47.667 --> 30:50.727
Who's been in here? Victor?

30:50.767 --> 30:55.427
I don't want him in here!
He's got a lot more to hide
than I do.

30:55.467 --> 30:57.967
I know what your maid
would find.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.730
How come our new partner's
so wound up
over some American kid,

31:01.767 --> 31:03.827
and yet he's got no issues
with your driver?

31:03.867 --> 31:05.627
Victor's more than my driver.

31:05.667 --> 31:08.367
Yeah,
we all know who Victor is.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.400
Who Victor was.

31:10.433 --> 31:14.633
Did you hire the American
to distract Trouvier,
so he wouldn't notice Victor?

31:14.667 --> 31:18.067
-Why don't you sit down
and drink something?
-Because I'm busy!

31:18.067 --> 31:19.927
(YELLS)

31:19.967 --> 31:23.067
-Whoa!
-(GROANS)

31:23.100 --> 31:25.400
-Come on.
-Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

31:25.433 --> 31:27.203
-Well, what hurts?
-Nothing!

31:27.233 --> 31:31.603
I'm on so many pain pills,
I can't even feel
my fucking feet.

31:31.633 --> 31:33.833
-Well, how can I help?
-Call the Navy,

31:33.867 --> 31:37.297
and ask them
for a list of sailors
who like to suck cock.

31:42.433 --> 31:44.333
Is that what
you're looking for?

31:45.800 --> 31:49.070
What are you gonna do...
if you find him?

31:49.967 --> 31:51.727
Hm?

31:57.833 --> 32:01.473
Let him go. Forget about him.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.330
Ah. So, we're all supposed
to crawl away, are we?

32:04.367 --> 32:06.897
Nina too?

32:06.933 --> 32:10.273
Just lose a few important
teeth and then be thankful
we've still got our tongue?

32:10.300 --> 32:12.430
Save your energy
for the fights you can win.

32:12.467 --> 32:14.197
Hm?

32:19.067 --> 32:21.627
(SIGHS)

32:21.667 --> 32:25.267
Think of all those creeps
that Maman made us
eat meals with...

32:25.300 --> 32:27.600
The bastard who threw
our furniture in the street.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.570
That arsehole who bought us
a Christmas tree,

32:32.600 --> 32:35.070
then broke off a branch
to beat the shit out of us.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.830
Oh, Jesus. (SIGHS)
What made you think of him?

32:37.867 --> 32:42.127
He was the last person
to call me "son"
before Trouvier.

32:45.067 --> 32:47.697
That didn't stop
till I broke his hand.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.633
Well, I'd go a little easier
on the Cotton King.

32:52.767 --> 32:54.767
This is one we're gonna win.

32:56.233 --> 32:58.403
-Does he know that?
-He will.

32:58.433 --> 33:02.233
If he's upset about
ten metres of velvet,
we'll use 15.

33:03.533 --> 33:05.273
(CHUCKLES)

33:37.267 --> 33:39.427
It felt good to be seen...

33:42.400 --> 33:45.070
After so many years
of hiding.

33:46.267 --> 33:48.427
Keeping my head down.

33:49.933 --> 33:52.073
I just...

33:53.167 --> 33:55.327
I felt free.

33:57.967 --> 34:00.127
(SOBS)

34:01.167 --> 34:03.697
-Nina...
-It didn't last.

34:06.067 --> 34:08.167
It couldn't.

34:12.233 --> 34:14.233

34:23.500 --> 34:25.270
-No...
-(SOBS)

34:28.199 --> 34:31.630
HELEN: Where have you been?
-Claude's.

34:31.667 --> 34:34.627
We had a dinner engagement
with my aunt and uncle.

34:34.667 --> 34:37.226
-(SIGHS)
-Did you forget?

34:37.266 --> 34:39.597
I'll tell them
you're working late.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.730
Why does your mother think
that that cottage is for her?

34:44.766 --> 34:48.496
And why does she think
that I'm the one
sticking her there?

34:48.533 --> 34:50.803
I thought that place was
supposed to be for us?

34:50.833 --> 34:53.233
It was. It is.

34:53.266 --> 34:56.226
But with seven weeks
to pull this all together,

34:56.266 --> 34:58.227
I don't think
we'll be using it.

34:58.267 --> 35:01.497
(SLURRED) And having my
mother around tends to slow
down the production line.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.473
Well, she thinks I'm the one
putting her out to pasture.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.670
-I will clarify.
-Good luck with that.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.397
-Why are you wearing that?
-For Nina.

35:25.433 --> 35:27.373
And because
I feel good in it.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.230
And it deserves
to be seen by people.

35:30.267 --> 35:32.367
Plan for success, Paul.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.230
We're done
drawing on our stockings.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.527
Women want
to feel pampered...

35:38.700 --> 35:40.530
...and beautiful again.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.770
At least I do.

36:10.767 --> 36:12.767
Do you want me to change?

36:15.400 --> 36:17.570
You do look beautiful
in that.

36:20.933 --> 36:24.333
Wear it, if you want.

36:24.367 --> 36:28.297
I'm just tired of
seeing people that I love
be hurt and humiliated.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.700

you a sweater. You're soaked.

there should be an open
bottle about here somewhere.

If my brother hasn't already
milked it dry.

37:40.267 --> 37:42.827
He was here? Today?

37:42.867 --> 37:45.627
Yeah.
He told me the gory details.

37:45.667 --> 37:47.667
I'm sorry.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.470
I wish
I could have been there.

37:50.500 --> 37:53.670
I would have flattened
every last one of them.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.270
Ah... I couldn't move.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.800
Not scared of a little blood,
are you?

37:58.833 --> 38:01.473
-There was no blood.
-Well, there will be
when I shave.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.070
Come on.

38:03.067 --> 38:05.267
And if I don't bleed
to death...

38:05.300 --> 38:10.070

and catch the 9pm
showing at the Quarter.

No.

46:26.900 --> 46:28.630
No, I'm not here for money.

46:29.633 --> 46:31.403
What are you here for?

46:33.067 --> 46:35.067
How do you know my husband?

46:38.167 --> 46:40.327
You're not in the Navy,
are you?

46:41.967 --> 46:44.127
(LIGHT FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

47:16.367 --> 47:18.227
(DOOR SHUTS)

47:26.300 --> 47:28.800
Is there anything
I can say to her? I didn't--

47:28.833 --> 47:30.633
I'm sure she heard you.

47:33.433 --> 47:37.073
I only took her
to that market
because I wanted to capture

47:37.067 --> 47:40.467
that dress against buildings
with some character,
you know?

47:40.500 --> 47:42.530
The textured walls,
the pockmarks and the dents.

47:42.567 --> 47:45.167
Those dents in the walls
that you love so much,

47:45.200 --> 47:47.170
many of them
come from bullets...

47:48.067 --> 47:50.067
...that passed through
people first.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.330
Juliette?

48:01.100 --> 48:03.800
Take this bag downstairs,
please.

48:03.833 --> 48:06.073
Monsieur's waiting for it.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.370
Sorry to make you wait.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.570
-Is that the one
from the market?
-No. God, no.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.300
That would take
more than a day to restore.

49:29.167 --> 49:30.927
Crazy, isn't it?

49:30.967 --> 49:33.527
Anyone wanting to destroy
something so beautiful.

49:33.567 --> 49:35.727
-(CAR DOOR SHUTS)
-You can't eat a dress.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.670
I saw you yesterday.

49:39.667 --> 49:41.597
In church.

49:41.633 --> 49:43.573
What?

49:43.600 --> 49:44.970
St Gervais.

49:45.067 --> 49:48.097
I was there too.
We go to the same church.

49:49.133 --> 49:51.303
I don't go to church.

50:05.200 --> 50:07.670
(CAR ENGINE REVS)

50:13.267 --> 50:14.927
You can leave that
for tomorrow.

50:14.967 --> 50:18.127
-The other girls
have already left.
-I'd like to finish.

50:18.167 --> 50:21.367
Not tonight.
Let's go home, huh?

50:21.400 --> 50:24.630
Monsieur Sabine has offered
to pay for a taxi.

50:24.667 --> 50:28.027
You don't need to be
walking through the streets.

50:28.067 --> 50:30.197
Being in a taxi won't make me
feel any safer.

50:30.233 --> 50:31.973
-That's my job.
-Really?

50:32.000 --> 50:35.300
When you still shake
every time a train conductor
asks for your ticket?

50:36.900 --> 50:39.070
Nina...

50:41.700 --> 50:45.330
-I'm not sure why Monsieur
Sabine wanted you to model.
-Neither am I.

50:45.367 --> 50:49.327
It's a big leap to go from
being invisible to being
a side show in the streets.

50:49.367 --> 50:51.527
He never asked us
to be invisible.

50:52.900 --> 50:54.630
We asked him.

50:54.667 --> 50:56.497
There was no other choice.

51:01.267 --> 51:04.097
It doesn't matter.

51:04.133 --> 51:06.933
I told him that
I wouldn't do it again.

51:06.967 --> 51:08.627
That's too bad.

51:08.667 --> 51:11.667
It was nice to see someone
else recognise your beauty.

51:13.067 --> 51:17.167
Every parent sees their child
as a gift to the world, Nina.

51:17.200 --> 51:22.400
Your father used to take you
to those same book stalls
when you were very young.

51:22.433 --> 51:24.533
-If he saw those
photographs, he will--
-He won't!

51:24.567 --> 51:26.367
It's been
nearly three years.

51:26.400 --> 51:29.270
Don't you think he'd be
standing here right now
if he could?

51:40.100 --> 51:42.370
I'll get my coat.

51:49.767 --> 51:52.067
Nina... Nina, please...

52:08.833 --> 52:10.433
Thank you.

52:10.467 --> 52:12.367
Has he packed up
his camera yet?

52:12.400 --> 52:15.170
I came straight from
delivering an order
to a client.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.070
It's been a very busy day.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.900
Yes, I know.

52:18.933 --> 52:20.803
I have five newspapers
on my desk,

52:20.833 --> 52:23.403
each one of them
carrying that picture.

52:23.433 --> 52:25.173
I warned you about
that photographer.

52:25.200 --> 52:29.300
-I knew there was an agenda.
-There's no agenda, Jules.

52:29.333 --> 52:31.203
It's just a photograph
that shows a dress

52:31.233 --> 52:33.803
that has the ability
to excite and offend.

52:33.833 --> 52:36.303
Two qualities that
separate us from the pack.

52:36.333 --> 52:38.403
Are you out of your mind?

52:38.433 --> 52:42.533
If you won't sack that
bastard, I will do it myself.

52:42.567 --> 52:45.367
No, you won't.

52:45.400 --> 52:50.830
As partners, let's be
very clear about what we
each bring to this marriage.

52:50.867 --> 52:55.067
You've asked me
to create a collection that
puts Paris back on the map.

52:55.100 --> 52:57.200
I intend to do that.

52:57.233 --> 53:00.073
Billy is part of that plan.

53:00.067 --> 53:02.367
There are many people
dependent on my leadership.

53:02.400 --> 53:06.070
They work around the clock,
tirelessly supporting me,

53:06.067 --> 53:08.767
because they share
my vision for the future.

53:09.967 --> 53:12.197
I'm hoping
you can do the same.

53:12.233 --> 53:14.703
They are not your partner,
son.

53:14.733 --> 53:16.603
-They're your staff.
-No.

53:17.800 --> 53:20.630
They're my family.

53:20.667 --> 53:23.297
See, I never had much of one
when I was growing up.

53:23.333 --> 53:26.603
But don't get me wrong, I did
just fine without a father.

53:26.633 --> 53:29.433
And I'm sure as hell
not looking for one now.

53:33.133 --> 53:35.133
Shall we order?

53:37.533 --> 53:41.703
If your next collection
fails, Monsieur Sabine...

53:41.733 --> 53:43.773
...our partnership is
effectively over,

53:43.800 --> 53:47.070
and you will owe me
everything I've put into it,

53:47.100 --> 53:49.770
with interest.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.730
Is that understood?

53:54.200 --> 53:56.100
Yes, it is.

54:01.567 --> 54:04.127
In that case,
I probably shouldn't
take time out to dine.

54:04.167 --> 54:06.667
I have a lot of work
ahead of me.

54:08.433 --> 54:10.373
And if we're gonna be
honest with each other,

54:10.400 --> 54:13.770
you should know
Billy did not submit that
photograph to the papers.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.800
I did.

54:21.533 --> 54:23.273
Bon appГ©tit.
