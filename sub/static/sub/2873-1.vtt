Hi, I'm Jake Winton.

00:11.229 --> 00:12.588
If you're receiving this video,

00:12.688 --> 00:15.008
it means that you have invested
in MINDS i.

00:15.108 --> 00:19.762
It also means that we have
raised $2.5 million

00:19.862 --> 00:22.682
to start production on the sickest piece

00:22.782 --> 00:25.518
of wearable technology
on the market today.

00:25.618 --> 00:28.938
It's also much more affordable
than any of our competitors.

00:29.038 --> 00:32.108
I'm not gonna name any names,
but I think you know who you are.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.402
I'm telling you,
there is no other product

00:34.502 --> 00:38.239
on the market today that is
as comprehensive, easy to use,

00:38.339 --> 00:41.367
and fucking cool as MINDS i.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.370
<i>Wired Magazine, TechCrunch,</i>

00:43.470 --> 00:45.956
and a whole mess of other media agree.

00:46.056 --> 00:47.999
Look, I'm not an inventor.
I'm an investor.

00:48.099 --> 00:50.459
All of my money is in this product.

00:50.559 --> 00:52.128
I know a good thing when I see it,

00:52.228 --> 00:55.589
and I want you guys
to see it all, so thank you.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.349
And you're welcome.

Hey, dude, take off the braided belt.
No bullshit in my house, okay?

Hey, lawyer man, tell me
you're bringing by more demos.

02:32.161 --> 02:35.190

fucked by technology.

02:35.290 --> 02:38.026
Hudson, please.

02:38.126 --> 02:39.444
They're the manufacturer.

02:39.544 --> 02:41.704
What do you mean,
they can't manufacture the part?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.948
No, no, fuck.

02:44.048 --> 02:45.824
Look, it's China,
it's a big-ass country.

02:45.924 --> 02:49.120
We'll just find someone else
to make the part, okay?

02:49.220 --> 02:54.417
We just need to keep this quiet
and keep the launch smooth.

03:24.046 --> 03:25.114
My mom's dead.

03:25.214 --> 03:26.616
Right.
- But we're gonna find

03:26.716 --> 03:28.159
a new manufacturer

03:59.415 --> 04:02.151
Get your tickets out, please.

04:02.251 --> 04:04.946
I'm sorry, I forget where...

04:05.046 --> 04:07.915
I put it. There it is.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.539
Going backwards makes
a lot of people nauseous.

04:14.639 --> 04:17.416
Yeah, I don't get nauseous, man.

04:17.516 --> 04:20.469
New Rochelle.
Be there in no time.

<i>Hey, man, where's my
<i>money? I trusted you, give me a call...</i></i>

04:36.953 --> 04:38.688

04:38.788 --> 04:41.023

04:42.792 --> 04:44.819

05:22.698 --> 05:24.817
<i>Hey!</i>

05:24.917 --> 05:29.155
It's Jake, your brother.
I left you messages.

05:29.255 --> 05:30.906
Well, I had no idea...

05:31.006 --> 05:33.909
What are you doing here? Hi.

05:34.009 --> 05:35.828
Uh...

05:35.928 --> 05:37.580
Do you not answer
your phone anymore?

05:37.680 --> 05:41.625
I know, yeah, it's basically impossible
for me to talk on the phone.

05:41.725 --> 05:43.336
Hi... come in, hi.

05:43.436 --> 05:45.004
Hi.
- Ugh.

05:45.104 --> 05:46.839
Whoa. You all right?

05:46.939 --> 05:50.176
No, it's good. I'm good, I'm fine.

05:50.276 --> 05:51.761
I'm pregnant.

05:51.861 --> 05:54.930
Really? Wasn't Teddy born,
like, yesterday?

05:55.030 --> 05:56.432
He's three.

05:56.532 --> 05:57.892
He is?

05:57.992 --> 05:59.643
And there's another one in there?

05:59.743 --> 06:02.730
There's like nothing
going on with this belly.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.816
Sorry, I just... I don't like
people touching it.

06:05.916 --> 06:06.901
But you can touch it.

06:07.001 --> 06:09.236
No, it's fine, I don't need
to touch anything.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.405
So how pregnant are you?

06:11.505 --> 06:12.748
13 weeks.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.293
Wow.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.163
Why aren't you wearing
your glasses?

06:19.263 --> 06:20.706
I got Lasik.

06:20.806 --> 06:22.083
You had surgery?

06:22.183 --> 06:23.876
You don't have surgery
without telling people.

06:23.976 --> 06:26.087
I could have come in for that.
When did you do it?

06:26.187 --> 06:27.797
I don't know. Last year.

06:27.897 --> 06:29.473
Wow.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.343
Your eyes look kind of buggy.

06:32.443 --> 06:34.637
Yeah, that's what I was going for.

06:34.737 --> 06:36.639
Maybe you should check your thyroid.

06:36.739 --> 06:38.224
You should check your thyroid.

06:38.324 --> 06:41.185
Sorry, this is Teddy's
wake of destruction.

06:41.285 --> 06:44.355
Just step over that turtle,
and have a seat.

06:44.455 --> 06:46.065
Where is Teddy? Teddy!

06:46.165 --> 06:49.110
He's actually at daycare,
and I have a early meeting,

06:49.210 --> 06:52.947
so can you stay for dinner?

06:53.047 --> 06:56.200
Yeah. Is it cool if I crash here?

06:56.300 --> 06:58.127
Tonight? Sure.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.414
Oh, don't sit there.
Sorry, that's where

07:01.514 --> 07:03.791
Teddy puts his leaf babies to sleep.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.960
Oh, that's where his leaf babies
sleep, of course.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.503
That makes perfect sense.

07:07.603 --> 07:10.297
So, how long do you need to stay?

07:10.397 --> 07:12.258
For a couple nights.

07:12.358 --> 07:13.384
That's a big bag.

07:13.484 --> 07:15.511
Yeah, well, I couldn't cram
everything into a little bag

07:15.611 --> 07:17.688
when my entire world
imploded upon itself.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.433
You don't seem very focused.

07:20.533 --> 07:21.934
Huh? I'm focused.

07:22.034 --> 07:25.479
I'm focused on you
and on folding this laundry

07:25.579 --> 07:29.191
and on not being late.
What is going on?

07:29.291 --> 07:31.735
Well, you can basically take
the last three years of my life

07:31.835 --> 07:34.488
and light them on fire.
Company's fucked.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.408
My girlfriend dumped me.
People hate me.

07:37.508 --> 07:41.370
Oh. Did you, uh, lose a lot of money?

07:41.470 --> 07:45.666
Oh, yeah, no, I lost, uh,
all of my money and then some,

07:45.766 --> 07:48.127
and then I lost a lot
of other people's money,

07:48.227 --> 07:50.171
which feels surprisingly terrible.

07:50.271 --> 07:52.298
Dude, can you just take the day off?

07:52.398 --> 07:55.009
I can't. I... I've been out a lot lately

07:55.109 --> 07:59.513
and my principal is tracking
my level of commitment, so...

07:59.613 --> 08:00.681
Whatever.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.099
You're gonna be fine, Jake.

08:02.199 --> 08:04.651
Fuck those people.
I'm done with the city.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.696
Your shirt's buttoned wrong.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.357
Oh. Shit. Thanks.

08:10.457 --> 08:14.820
So, if it's a couple of months,
Is that okay? Three months?

08:14.920 --> 08:16.155
Jesus, three months?

08:16.255 --> 08:19.074
I'm sorry I didn't schedule
my life falling apart better for you.

08:19.174 --> 08:21.076
That's not what I'm saying.
You just...

08:21.176 --> 08:22.912
You show up here
with your big bag,

08:23.012 --> 08:25.122
and you haven't been out here
for at least a year.

08:25.222 --> 08:26.840
I was here for Teddy's birthday.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.585
We invited you and you didn't come.

08:29.685 --> 08:31.504
Well, I wanted to be there, okay?

08:31.604 --> 08:32.922
That counts for something.

08:33.022 --> 08:34.924
I have to talk to Danny.
- Like ask him permission?

08:35.024 --> 08:37.009
Like have a conversation
where I ask him

08:37.109 --> 08:39.178
how he feels about you living
with us for three months

08:39.278 --> 08:40.429
because he's my husband.

08:40.529 --> 08:41.931
Can you answer me
as to why there are

08:42.031 --> 08:44.107
so many new sconces
around the house?

08:47.152 --> 08:49.196
We're trying to sell the house.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.943
Could you maybe not sell
our childhood home right now?

08:54.043 --> 08:55.869
Please?

08:56.995 --> 09:00.040
I'm really sorry, Jake.
Look, just...

09:00.707 --> 09:02.826
Just hang out,
and eat whatever you want,

09:02.926 --> 09:05.921
and I'll be home tonight
and we can all have dinner.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.465
Okay.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.797
It's freezing in this house.

09:14.897 --> 09:17.057
Can you get me a sweatshirt, please?

09:35.534 --> 09:38.862
Ah! Fuck you,
you pressed wood piece of shit.

09:38.962 --> 09:40.864
Oh, look who it is.

09:40.964 --> 09:42.741
Good nap?

09:42.841 --> 09:44.159
Yeah, I forgot where I was.

09:44.259 --> 09:46.245
You were in my bed
with your shoes on.

09:46.345 --> 09:48.163
Uh...
- It's okay.

09:48.263 --> 09:51.625
Hey, sorry to hear about,
you know, everything.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.377
Oh, no worries.

09:53.477 --> 09:56.130
So you gonna replace that door
with more sconces?

09:56.230 --> 09:59.049
We're doing reclaimed walnut.

09:59.149 --> 10:00.384
Justine and Teddy are upstairs.

10:00.484 --> 10:01.677
Oh, I'll go say hi to them.

10:01.777 --> 10:03.178
You know what, no, no, don't do that.

10:03.278 --> 10:04.513
She's pretty upset about that nap.

10:04.613 --> 10:07.182
Why don't you be my little helper?
Help me take the door off.

10:07.282 --> 10:08.934
You know I pay a guy to hang
pictures in my apartment.

10:09.034 --> 10:10.185
Dude, it's very easy.

10:10.285 --> 10:11.854
You just take this, put it in there...

10:11.954 --> 10:12.988
Uh-huh.
- And then look.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.442
Exciting.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.236
Do I need goggles?
- No, dude.

10:19.336 --> 10:20.362
Like that?

10:20.462 --> 10:21.447
Yeah. Oh!

10:21.547 --> 10:22.531
Oh, ho.
- Lookit, lookit.

10:22.631 --> 10:24.700
Hey!
- Hey! Holy shit!

10:24.800 --> 10:26.785
Hey
- Teddy!

10:26.885 --> 10:28.370
Unky!

10:28.470 --> 10:30.873
Look how big you are!
You're like an adult man.

10:30.973 --> 10:32.416
I'm holding an adult man!

10:32.516 --> 10:34.293
I have a train table.

10:34.393 --> 10:36.754
Yeah, I just used
an electric screwdriver.

10:36.854 --> 10:38.088
Let's go crazy!

10:38.188 --> 10:39.715
Let's go crazy in the morning.

10:39.815 --> 10:41.050
We just came in to say goodnight.

10:41.150 --> 10:42.968
Good night? What time is it?

10:43.068 --> 10:44.928
7:45. Time for books and bed.

10:45.028 --> 10:46.722
Oh!
- What?

10:46.822 --> 10:49.266
Shit, that means I've been
sleeping for, like, nine hours.

10:49.366 --> 10:50.392
<i>91/2.</i>

10:50.492 --> 10:51.977
Shucks, that's a long nap.

10:52.077 --> 10:53.070
Shucks!

10:54.404 --> 10:55.856
You can't get mad at people for napping.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.399
Dude, we get mad at anybody
who gets any sleep.

10:57.499 --> 10:59.026
Okay, Mr. Monster Man, let's bring it in.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.194
Family hug.
- Bring it in.

11:00.294 --> 11:01.320
Family hug. Come on.
- No!

11:01.420 --> 11:03.030
Oh!

11:03.130 --> 11:04.990
I'm hungry, I'm gonna have to
eat some of... grr.

11:05.090 --> 11:06.367
No, you can't eat him!

11:06.467 --> 11:07.451
All right.

11:07.551 --> 11:08.702
Mwah.
- I'll start dinner.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.912
Hi.
- Good night.

11:10.012 --> 11:11.288
Okay.
- Good night!

11:11.388 --> 11:12.539
Night, Teddy.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.333
What is that?

11:14.433 --> 11:15.959
This guy.
- Is that that...

11:16.059 --> 11:17.503
<i>Is that that song from <i>The Shining?</i></i>

11:17.603 --> 11:19.797
Yeah, this guy wants to kill me.

11:19.897 --> 11:21.765
I love that song.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.932
Jeez, You guys are eating
like rescue dogs.

11:30.032 --> 11:33.435
I know, we got to slow down.

11:33.535 --> 11:35.270
You talk to him yet?

11:35.370 --> 11:36.571
No.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.816
What?

11:38.916 --> 11:41.026
I need to stay here
for a few months.

11:41.126 --> 11:42.444
Yeah, sure.

11:42.544 --> 11:43.821
Mm!

11:43.921 --> 11:45.114
What?

11:45.214 --> 11:46.365
My sister moved back in
with my parents

11:46.465 --> 11:49.326
after she had that nervous breakdown,
dropped out of school. Same thing.

11:49.426 --> 11:51.453
Yeah, it's the same thing as that.

11:51.553 --> 11:53.288
I haven't had a chance
to talk to him yet.

11:53.388 --> 11:57.251
I can help out around the house,
buy groceries, build stuff,

11:57.351 --> 11:59.294
rip shit out of walls as needed.

11:59.394 --> 12:01.130
You want to watch Teddy?

12:01.230 --> 12:02.673
Yeah, sure.
I'll watch cartoons with him

12:02.773 --> 12:04.133
while you guys have
a night on the town.

12:04.233 --> 12:07.060
I could do that, like,
every other week.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.723
He can watch Teddy.

12:10.823 --> 12:13.308
You mean like 'watch him' watch him?

12:13.408 --> 12:14.727
No.
- Come on, dude.

12:14.827 --> 12:17.229
That day care sucks. It's not clean.

12:17.329 --> 12:19.356
The kids are always
licking the toys, and...

12:19.456 --> 12:20.899
One got whooping cough last week.

12:20.999 --> 12:22.568
Yeah, it's fucking dark ages there.

12:22.668 --> 12:26.572
Plus, he'll help us out money-wise.

12:26.672 --> 12:27.906
We're not broke.

12:28.006 --> 12:29.082
Well...

12:30.333 --> 12:31.452
What?

12:31.552 --> 12:34.163
Hi. What the fuck's going on?

12:34.263 --> 12:35.748
<i>I...</i>

12:35.848 --> 12:37.416
Nothing, it's... Well,

12:37.516 --> 12:40.794
I guess... The idea on the table

12:40.894 --> 12:47.551
is that you... stay for a few months,
and you look after Teddy.

12:47.651 --> 12:50.554
Guys, I'm talking about,
like, buying groceries,

12:50.654 --> 12:52.473
maybe build a few things.

12:52.573 --> 12:54.349
I need you to make me feel better.

12:54.449 --> 12:56.435
Come on, you fuck. He's cute.

12:56.535 --> 12:58.312
You need to get a flu shot.

12:58.412 --> 13:00.647
We'll take care of it, dock it
out of your pay, or whatever.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.065
Oh, we're paying him now?

13:02.165 --> 13:03.442
We can't not.

13:03.542 --> 13:06.203
Can't not.
How much we talking about?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.907
300.
- A day?

13:10.007 --> 13:12.709
A week, maybe.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.628
You should take it, bro.

13:18.882 --> 13:19.875
Fine.

13:19.975 --> 13:22.511
Awesome! I'm gonna get the Breyers.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.923
You seriously gonna do this?

13:26.023 --> 13:28.008
You know I have a DUI, right?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.385
You don't trust me with your kid?

13:30.485 --> 13:31.895
Absolutely.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.402
Dude! The old room.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.315
I'm gonna need, like, four guys
to get rid of that thing. Sorry.

13:43.415 --> 13:47.569
Look, left your dope-ass
Bar Mitzvah thing up.

13:47.669 --> 13:48.954
Guess I had a lot of interests.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.874
Still badass.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.084
Are you okay?
Do you want to talk?

14:02.184 --> 14:03.718
No, I'm good.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.587
Open or closed?

14:05.687 --> 14:07.055
Closed.

14:08.557 --> 14:09.550
Good night.

14:09.650 --> 14:10.725
Good night.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.964
Hey, so you're cool, right,
with the whole thing?

14:49.064 --> 14:50.132
Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:50.232 --> 14:51.216
Fine.

14:51.316 --> 14:52.642
Okay.

14:56.187 --> 14:59.641
He decides when he comes
and when he goes, you know.

14:59.741 --> 15:02.728
Whatever works for him.

15:02.828 --> 15:04.771
Okay, so we are gonna talk about it?

15:04.871 --> 15:08.525
No, no, I'm sorry. I'm done.

15:08.625 --> 15:09.610
Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:09.710 --> 15:10.744
Okay.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.870
You know, he doesn't even
know how old Teddy is.

15:19.970 --> 15:23.624
I just don't... l mean, it's not
like he has to get him anything.

15:23.724 --> 15:28.253
He's just like my dad.
Everything's a fly-by, I...

15:28.353 --> 15:30.005
He just shows up here like...

15:30.105 --> 15:32.007
Okay, I'm gonna go and drink a coke

15:32.107 --> 15:33.967
so we can keep talking about it.
- No, it's fine.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.553
No, it's fine, it's fine. I...

15:36.653 --> 15:38.063
He's my brother.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.941
Okay.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.283
Fuck, I forgot to brush my teeth.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.427
Spit in this.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.593
I love you.

16:16.693 --> 16:17.803
Hmm?

16:17.903 --> 16:18.971
I love you.

16:19.071 --> 16:20.730
I'm sorry, I didn't...
- I love you.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.612
I'm jumping.

16:35.712 --> 16:39.366
Stop. Stop, Teddy.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.160
Too early, buddy.
Stop jumping on the bed, okay?

16:42.260 --> 16:45.163
It's 7:00. We've been up for two hours.

16:45.263 --> 16:46.707
What?
- Yeah.

16:46.807 --> 16:48.917
He has? How's that possible?

16:49.017 --> 16:50.552
That's crazy.

16:54.556 --> 16:55.799
It's going down!

16:55.899 --> 16:57.968
Can you... I really feel it. Can you?

16:58.068 --> 17:00.437
Yeah, I can feel it.

17:01.438 --> 17:04.524
Unky Jake needs a little coffee,
and then I'll be ready to play, okay?

17:08.028 --> 17:10.063
Coffee bean!

17:10.163 --> 17:12.157
Coffee beans!

17:13.116 --> 17:16.445
'I used to just splash.
Now I make waves.

17:16.545 --> 17:19.489
'I used to be shy.
Now I am brave.

17:19.589 --> 17:22.868
'I used to just watch.
Now I can dig.

17:22.968 --> 17:26.671
I used to be little.
Now I am big.'

17:29.132 --> 17:31.468
How is this not putting you to sleep?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.879
Okay, Teddy's gonna be a good boy

17:33.979 --> 17:35.847
while Unky Jake does his business.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.008
No, Teddy, you can't play with that.

17:38.108 --> 17:39.926
That is a heavy glass paperweight.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.344
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:41.444 --> 17:43.396
You can't play with glass
like that, buddy.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.058
Okay.

17:46.158 --> 17:47.776
Hold on a second,
we're gonna deal with this.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.064
<i>This better be an emergency.</i>

17:52.164 --> 17:54.149
Yeah, no, this is an emergency.

17:54.249 --> 17:56.818
<i>I can't even go to the bathroom
without him breaking something.</i>

17:56.918 --> 18:01.456
I'm here with a student who is literally
a million times smarter than you.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.159
She's gonna get into Harvard.

18:04.259 --> 18:05.619
<i>Well, what am I supposed to do?</i>

18:05.719 --> 18:07.287
Jake, just leave the door open.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.789
I tried leaving the door open,

18:08.889 --> 18:11.966
but your devil child
wouldn't listen to me.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.880
I'm sorry, it's my little brother.

18:16.980 --> 18:18.173
He's kind of an idiot.

18:18.273 --> 18:19.849
Oh my God, mine's an effing moron.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.804
You really think I can get into Harvard?

18:23.904 --> 18:25.563
Yeah, I really do.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.146
Don't climb up there.
Teddy, please,

18:33.246 --> 18:34.689
just give me one minute.

18:34.789 --> 18:36.274
Teddy, that's... it's fragile.

18:36.374 --> 18:38.026
I know you think this is hilarious,

18:38.126 --> 18:40.370
but this is one of the more
embarrassing events of my life.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.500
Look, Jean, if Shirley's gonna
organize a meeting with parents

18:53.600 --> 18:55.335
about college prep strategy during lunch,

18:55.435 --> 18:56.920
I'm gonna need a little more notice.

18:57.020 --> 18:59.005
What's happening?
Are we rescheduling?

18:59.105 --> 19:00.966
You left me a note
about a parent meeting?

19:01.066 --> 19:02.676
Yes, I did, right there in your mailbox.

19:02.776 --> 19:03.844
I have a cell phone.

19:03.944 --> 19:05.720
Yes, I know you have a cell phone.

19:05.820 --> 19:07.139
They're everywhere.
- Look, Shirley,

19:07.239 --> 19:09.224
my brother just showed up out of nowhere

19:09.324 --> 19:12.277
and he's staying with us. I'm pregnant.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.237
I have a doctor's appointment.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.649
Listen, I'm sure the baby will be great,

19:17.749 --> 19:19.985
but I would like
for you and I to be great,

19:20.085 --> 19:22.445
and that means we gotta put
a little more effort

19:22.545 --> 19:24.948
into our communication. Mm-hmm.

19:25.048 --> 19:27.200
Okay. So let me be clear.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.162
You want me to miss
my ultrasound appointment

19:30.262 --> 19:34.132
to check that my baby is healthy
because I didn't check my mailbox?

19:37.010 --> 19:40.088
Jean, we'll reschedule.
Can you make that happen?

19:40.188 --> 19:42.132
And please look around
and find my password.

19:42.232 --> 19:44.100
I can never remember it.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.697
Yeah?

20:05.797 --> 20:07.699
Hi, uh, how do you
open the stroller,

20:07.799 --> 20:09.367
and what time are you coming home?

20:09.467 --> 20:11.620
You step down on it, and then
you push the handles up and out.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.713
I can't talk, I'm at work. I gotta go.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.209
<i>Who I am,</i>

20:17.309 --> 20:19.802
<i>not for what you wanted me to be.</i>

20:22.931 --> 20:28.603
<i>I just wanted you to be happy.
That's all.</i>

20:31.856 --> 20:37.070
Oh, my God.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.815
Sweet rides, right?
Good afternoon, ladies.

20:40.915 --> 20:43.944
What, you've never
seen a kid in a suitcase before?

20:44.044 --> 20:45.362
Who's a stud, Teddy?

20:45.462 --> 20:46.446
Me!

20:46.546 --> 20:49.449
Yeah, that's right.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.459
Suitcase stud!

20:56.714 --> 20:59.259
Kind of a beat scene,
huh,Teddy?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.473
Teddy, why don't you go hit
the monkey bars for a second?

21:13.573 --> 21:16.526
Yeah, why don't you go hit
the jungle gym, bud.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.943
Oof.

21:25.043 --> 21:27.529
They grow up so fast now,
they can just play on their own.

21:27.629 --> 21:29.948
Hmm.
- Hmm.

21:30.048 --> 21:32.083
How old's your little boy?

21:32.333 --> 21:33.702
She's a girl.

21:33.802 --> 21:36.170
No doubt, no doubt.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.507
You're a girl too, aren't you?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.585
I'm Jake.

21:42.685 --> 21:43.670
Blanca.

21:43.770 --> 21:46.047
Blanca? But you're not white?

21:46.147 --> 21:47.132
Funny.

21:47.232 --> 21:48.466
I know, right?
- Mm-hmm.

21:48.566 --> 21:50.135
It's crazy. Yeah, it's funny,

21:50.235 --> 21:51.678
'cause it's like...
- Whoo! Pa-pow, pow, pow!

21:51.778 --> 21:54.139
<i>Pa-pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!
'Pa-pow, pow!</i>

21:54.239 --> 21:55.515
Hey, Armin.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.058
Hey, Blanca.

21:57.158 --> 21:58.601
Mwah.

21:58.701 --> 22:00.145
How are you, gorgeous?
- No, you're gorgeous.

22:00.245 --> 22:03.440
No, Georgia is gorgeous.
Hello, Georgia.

22:03.540 --> 22:05.358
Hey, if you want,
Bash and I are gonna go

22:05.458 --> 22:06.985
have snacks
on the giant turtle today,

22:07.085 --> 22:08.945
so you are invited.
- Oh.

22:09.045 --> 22:11.156
Oh, shit, I forgot to feed Teddy.
Do you have any snacks?

22:11.256 --> 22:12.240
Hey, language, man.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.867
Just a little something.
I'm sorry, he...

22:13.967 --> 22:17.162
Wow.
- So this is Teddy's nanny.

22:17.262 --> 22:18.705
Oh.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.416
I'm actually his uncle,
and what does 'oh' mean?

22:21.516 --> 22:23.543
Ah, nothing, man.
I'm just effing with you.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.420
Oh, hey, are you guys going
to the wool festival today?

22:25.520 --> 22:27.213
Mm-hmm.
- Oh, great.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.591
You're gonna love this.
it's... they've got live sheep.

22:29.691 --> 22:32.218
The kids can pet the sheep.
There's a knitting workshop.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.721
The kids go crazy for it.
There's a yarn toss.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.181
Remember, we went last year.
- Uh-huh.

22:36.281 --> 22:38.016
Oh, is that where you made
the pizza hat?

22:38.116 --> 22:40.151
Nope, Blanca got me this hat.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.479
'Cause I was gonna say, it's awesome.

22:42.579 --> 22:44.606
Yeah.
- I mean, everybody loves pizza.

22:44.706 --> 22:46.733
I love pizza. You know, I'm
not touching carbs right now, but...

22:46.833 --> 22:47.950
We're going.
- Okay, good.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.370
Oh, shit.

22:51.454 --> 22:54.783
No, don't sip it from the straw.
Hold it up to your face, please, okay?

22:54.883 --> 22:56.368
There you go, like that.

22:56.468 --> 22:58.536
Good.
- Hey!

22:58.636 --> 23:01.623
Oh. Hi, little monster.

23:01.723 --> 23:04.167
How's my little baby?
You okay, hey, honey?

23:04.267 --> 23:05.627
I'm letting him do
whatever he wants.

23:05.727 --> 23:07.420
Hey, you did exactly
what I would've done.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.674
Tongues and lips bleed
like a m-o-t-h-e-r-f-u-c-k-e-r.

23:11.774 --> 23:14.094
Hey, hey. Let me see.
- I don't know what you're spelling.

23:14.194 --> 23:16.888
I called you, like,
a gazillion times, with information.

23:16.988 --> 23:18.973
Hey, I'm sorry. I know,
I had my phone on silent.

23:19.073 --> 23:21.893
I had five students today who didn't
get into their first choice of schools.

23:21.993 --> 23:23.019
It was an s-h-i-t-show.

23:23.119 --> 23:25.188
Just stop spelling.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23:25.288 --> 23:28.608
I had to pry his mouth open
to see if his teeth were still there.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.402
It was fucking rough.

23:30.502 --> 23:32.153
My God, you still have
baby blood on your shirt.

23:32.253 --> 23:34.239
What? Oh, my God.

23:34.339 --> 23:35.748
Oh, my God!

23:35.957 --> 23:37.325
Oh.

23:37.425 --> 23:40.120
Okay, hey, let me wash it.
I'll wash it off for you.

23:40.220 --> 23:43.873
Jake. Whoa, what's up, Channing Tatum?

23:43.973 --> 23:45.458
Huh? What is up with that?

23:45.558 --> 23:48.253
That is my letter of resignation
written in baby blood.

23:48.353 --> 23:50.547
Come on, it's been one day.
Where are you going?

23:50.647 --> 23:52.799
I don't know, I just... I gotta
go out for a little while.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.843
I'll bring the car back,
and then I'm gonna figure out

23:54.943 --> 23:56.428
where I'm gonna go next.

23:56.528 --> 23:59.772
Jake, come on.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.352
Hey. Hey.

24:04.452 --> 24:07.605
Are you my little monster? Huh?

24:07.705 --> 24:09.899
Yeah?

24:09.999 --> 24:14.036
Let me see your mouth, baby. Oh.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.045
Hey, are you smoking my cigarettes?

24:31.145 --> 24:32.213
What? You're smoking?

24:32.313 --> 24:33.882
No.
- You're an idiot.

24:33.982 --> 24:36.267
Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling at you.

24:37.310 --> 24:41.105
Please. You're about to have two kids.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.517
No cigarettes, please.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.694
And they're not yours.
You have to ask.

24:50.531 --> 24:51.824
Smooshed.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.277
You know I can just buy more.

24:54.377 --> 24:55.953
Not on your salary.

24:56.704 --> 24:57.955
Good night, assholes.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.294
Ow. Don't kiss me so it hurts.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.085
So what's up?

25:11.185 --> 25:13.087
Uh, nothing.

25:13.187 --> 25:15.306
Well, what are you gonna do now?

25:18.684 --> 25:21.304
Well, I was gonna sit here
and obsess over all the shit

25:21.404 --> 25:23.181
I've done wrong the last few years,

25:23.281 --> 25:26.734
and then probably fall asleep
watching Bravo.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.063
Want to smoke pot?

25:30.163 --> 25:32.114
I don't have pot.

25:38.246 --> 25:40.198
So cigarettes are a no-fly zone
but she's okay with this,

25:40.298 --> 25:42.116
or she doesn't know about this?

25:42.216 --> 25:44.077
Dude, I stopped this.

25:44.177 --> 25:46.913
When he turned two, I stopped.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.248
And she didn't even ask me to stop.

25:48.348 --> 25:49.832
She was like, 'You don't have to stop

25:49.932 --> 25:51.793
'cause he's getting older,'
and I was like,

25:51.893 --> 25:53.628
'I don't... I want to stop,'
and she's like, 'Well, you don't

25:53.728 --> 25:55.463
have to want to stop just
because he's getting older.'

25:55.563 --> 25:58.258
I... I'm like...

25:58.358 --> 26:01.469
I don't know... Dude, I don't
know, stop asking questions.

26:01.569 --> 26:04.931
Hey, you like the renovations?

26:05.031 --> 26:07.358
No.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.278
Nah.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.698
I like that you like staying up late.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.242
I love staying up late.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.988
And this... this gets the smell out?

26:20.088 --> 26:21.656

I know that sounds bad,

34:33.197 --> 34:34.648
Looking good, Bill!

34:34.748 --> 34:36.233
<i>Who is that, that handsome,
drop-dead gorgeous Danny?</i>

34:36.333 --> 34:37.735
I'm just walking through.
I'm working.

34:37.835 --> 34:39.695
<i>Don't go. Don't go.
- Where's Teddy?</i>

34:39.795 --> 34:41.864
Teddy's napping, Dad,
so it's just us, yeah.

34:41.964 --> 34:43.199
Oh.

34:43.299 --> 34:44.950
<i>Yeah.
- Miss that munchkin.</i>

34:45.050 --> 34:47.536
<i>Well, can he swim?</i>

34:47.636 --> 34:48.829
No, he's three.

34:48.929 --> 34:51.791
<i>Well, now's the time.
See, we waited too long with you two.</i>

34:51.891 --> 34:52.917
<i>Well, he's only three.
- 80...</i>

34:53.017 --> 34:54.919
<i>No, don't wait too long.</i>

34:55.019 --> 34:56.712
You didn't wait too long, did you, Dad?

34:56.812 --> 34:58.380
What?
- We can't hear you now.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.508
Jake.
- What? It's on mute.

35:00.608 --> 35:01.842
<i>I didn't touch a <i>thing.</i></i>
<i>- It's not working.</i>

35:01.942 --> 35:03.761
He's not good on the phone, okay?

35:03.861 --> 35:06.347
It's like he has no idea what's
going on with this family.

35:06.447 --> 35:08.849
He hasn't even asked why I'm here.

35:08.949 --> 35:10.351
You done?
- You call them every week?

35:10.451 --> 35:12.353
Yeah, every week.

35:12.453 --> 35:14.772
You have a death wish.

35:14.872 --> 35:16.107
<i>Hey.
- Probably... Oh, there we are.</i>

35:16.207 --> 35:17.733
<i>Hey. Hey.
- They're back.</i>

35:17.833 --> 35:19.235
<i>What happened?
We didn't do anything.</i>

35:19.335 --> 35:20.736
I... I think it just
dropped out for a second.

35:20.836 --> 35:21.821
<i>Don't make that happen.
- Technology.</i>

35:21.921 --> 35:22.905
Yeah.

35:23.005 --> 35:25.074
One of those things,
but we'll let you go.

35:25.174 --> 35:26.659
It was great to see you, and...

35:26.759 --> 35:27.910
<i>Wait, whoa, whoa.
- Don't go yet.</i>

35:28.010 --> 35:29.537
<i>When are we gonna
get to see Teddy?</i>

35:29.637 --> 35:30.788
<i>Yeah, that little Teddy Bear.</i>
<i>- No, he's napping <i>now,</i></i>

35:30.888 --> 35:32.373
so we'll try you later in the week.

35:32.473 --> 35:35.668
<i>Did he get those little
turquoise cufflinks I sent?</i>

35:35.768 --> 35:37.795
I did, I did, yeah.

35:37.895 --> 35:40.047
<i>You know, maybe for his
confirmation I could...</i>

35:40.147 --> 35:41.632
Or his Bar Mitzvah.

35:41.732 --> 35:46.220
<i>Okay, well, we'll just do
a little David thing,</i>

35:46.320 --> 35:48.097
<i>and then we'll do
a little Christ thing...</i>

35:48.197 --> 35:49.348
Yeah.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.641
<i>And you know, just have a wardrobe.</i>

35:50.741 --> 35:52.143
Uh-huh.

35:52.243 --> 35:53.936
Okay, well that's it,
so we're gonna go,

35:54.036 --> 35:56.355
but it was lovely to talk
to you, Dad, we miss you.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.440
<i>Yup, and you get that boy swimming.</i>

35:58.540 --> 36:00.109
I'm doing fine, by the way.

36:00.209 --> 36:01.277
<i>Okay, good one.</i>
<i>- Give my love to Teddy.</i>

36:01.377 --> 36:02.820
Okay, that's it, bye. Bye.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.663
Okay.
- Bye.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.034
I mean, that made me
physically nauseous.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.162
Do you like talking to her?
- I have a severe headache.

36:11.262 --> 36:14.590
I can smell the hairspray
through the screen.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.469
Teddy, you got
any straight pieces?

36:20.387 --> 36:21.805
Want to trade?

36:23.432 --> 36:24.425
Hi!

36:24.525 --> 36:26.051
Hi!
- Mom, I love you!

36:26.151 --> 36:29.847
Yeah! I love you!
Come here, monster man.

36:29.947 --> 36:32.057
Can I have a kiss? Please?

36:32.157 --> 36:33.267
Mwah.

36:33.367 --> 36:36.103
Look at these beautiful trains, huh?

36:36.203 --> 36:38.105
Yeah.
- Look at that.

36:38.205 --> 36:39.907
You guys are busy.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.492
So?

36:43.327 --> 36:44.745
It's gorgeous.

36:45.370 --> 36:50.284
I signed you up
for a 'Mommy and Me' swim class

36:50.384 --> 36:52.036
at the high school.

36:52.136 --> 36:54.205
I'm gonna swim!
- Yeah.

36:54.305 --> 36:56.123
It starts tomorrow.

36:56.223 --> 36:57.875
No.

36:57.975 --> 36:58.959
I did.

36:59.059 --> 37:00.878
I don't have a bathing suit.

37:00.978 --> 37:02.796
That's okay.
You can borrow one of Danny's.

37:02.896 --> 37:04.715
Ew, I'm not gonna wear
another man's bathing suit.

37:04.815 --> 37:06.050
That's like rubbing Ds.

37:06.150 --> 37:07.426
What are you, ten?

37:07.526 --> 37:09.478
I don't know, am I?

37:10.229 --> 37:12.389
You need some structure.
Danny will give you the car,

37:12.489 --> 37:15.234
he said he would, and Teddy's
old enough. He should learn.

37:15.609 --> 37:19.238
I agree that he should learn
to swim, with his mother.

37:20.280 --> 37:24.193
There's no classes available
on the weekend.

37:24.293 --> 37:26.161
I already checked.

37:27.287 --> 37:31.033
Okay.'Swim class, 3-5 years old.

37:31.133 --> 37:33.369
'Friday, 4:00-4:45.

37:33.469 --> 37:35.287
'Still available.

37:35.387 --> 37:38.540
Saturday, 2:00-2:45.
Still available.

37:38.640 --> 37:39.667
You want me to check Sunday?

37:39.767 --> 37:41.877
Are you done?
- Mm-hmm.

37:41.977 --> 37:46.098
2:00 PM. will fuck up his nap,
so we'll go Friday, together.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.094
Fine, but I get
my own bathing suit.

37:50.194 --> 37:52.554
I don't give a shit what you wear.

37:52.654 --> 37:54.265
Fine, I'm gonna do it nude.

37:54.365 --> 37:55.774
Yeah, good luck with that.

38:02.864 --> 38:06.694
Excuse me, you have anything else
that's a little less Margaritaville?

38:06.794 --> 38:08.996
No, what you see is
what we have, man.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.616
Holy shit.

38:12.716 --> 38:16.086
Hello? Dude.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.999
Nothing? Paul Reggio.

38:20.099 --> 38:22.793
Reggie Jackson? Come on, man,
everyone called me that.

38:22.893 --> 38:24.211
I went to New Rochelle High with you.

38:24.311 --> 38:25.462
Oh, right.

38:25.562 --> 38:27.172
Think we did Guys and Dolls together.

38:27.272 --> 38:28.549
I think you were Sky Masterson,

38:28.649 --> 38:30.426
and I think I was
Nicely-Nicely Johnson.

38:30.526 --> 38:32.136
No, that was Goldberg.

38:32.236 --> 38:34.563
That's right. I did tech.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.182
But if I auditioned, I would
have been Nicely-Nicely Johnson.

38:37.282 --> 38:39.768
No doubt.
All right, man, good to see you.

38:39.868 --> 38:41.353
Thanks, man, doing good.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.981
Doing good, you know,
assistant manager, so...

38:44.081 --> 38:45.316
Really?
- Some day.

38:45.416 --> 38:47.151
Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

38:47.251 --> 38:48.861
Sweet.
- Crazy, man.

38:48.961 --> 38:52.531
Oh, dude, do you remember
Ben Bresler's cast party...

38:52.631 --> 38:53.782
you went to?
I think it was the night

38:53.882 --> 38:55.367
you found out you got into Colgate.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.744
Cornell.
- Cornell, that's right.

38:56.844 --> 38:58.162
Yeah.
- Colgate's a toothpaste.

38:58.262 --> 39:02.333
Stupid. Oh, dude, you took
the hugest rip off of Bresler's bong.

39:02.433 --> 39:05.169
You tore your pants off,
you did LaserDisc karaoke

39:05.269 --> 39:06.879
<i>to the Moonlighting theme?</i>

39:06.979 --> 39:08.263
Yeah.
- We were like...

39:10.724 --> 39:12.885
Yeah.
- Mind blown, man.

39:12.985 --> 39:14.428
That was a fun night.

39:14.528 --> 39:16.513
Yeah, we all knew you were
going on to amazing things

39:16.613 --> 39:18.349
at that point.

39:18.449 --> 39:20.184
So what are you up to now, man?
Come on, gimme the rundown.

39:20.284 --> 39:21.852
Make me jealous.

39:21.952 --> 39:24.688
<i>Um... I'm actually doing,</i>

39:24.788 --> 39:26.899
like, early childhood education stuff now.

39:26.999 --> 39:29.234
Whoa. That sounds big.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.737
I was doing, like, a bunch
of tech stuff, and I was like,

39:31.837 --> 39:35.908
'Know what? Eh.
How 'bout I give back, you know?'

39:36.008 --> 39:37.826
Awesome.
- Yeah, it's going well.

39:37.926 --> 39:39.828
Kids.
- Yeah, they're the future.

39:39.928 --> 39:40.996
We'll see, but...

39:41.096 --> 39:42.706
Mm-hmm. No, they are.

39:42.806 --> 39:44.208
They will be.
- We'll see.

39:44.308 --> 39:45.959
No, it's undoubted
that children are the future.

39:46.059 --> 39:48.045
Crazy, man.
- Yeah, so...

39:48.145 --> 39:51.382
My sister's pregnant, so I'm,
like, staying at her place,

39:51.482 --> 39:53.509
and just kind of helping her
out a little bit,

39:53.609 --> 39:54.968
getting my ducks in a row.

39:55.068 --> 39:56.720
Yeah.

39:56.820 --> 40:00.432
She came in here
a couple weeks ago to buy a bra.

40:00.532 --> 40:01.558
It was the best.

40:01.658 --> 40:03.018
All right, cool, man, this is weird.

40:03.118 --> 40:04.228
I'm still thinking about it.

40:04.328 --> 40:05.771
I bet. Okay.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.398
Yeah, hey, well,
now that you're back, man,

40:07.498 --> 40:08.649
you should give me a call.
We do, like,

40:08.749 --> 40:10.526
a rotating brunch thing every Sunday

40:10.626 --> 40:13.570
with, like, the whole crew.
Like, Buskirk, Golub, Mclntire...

40:13.670 --> 40:15.197
Yeah, those guys weren't
in my crew, so...

40:15.297 --> 40:18.200
Me neither, but, like,
now we roll pretty deep.

40:18.300 --> 40:19.868
Yeah, here, let me take your phone.

40:19.968 --> 40:22.079
Oh.
- I'm gonna call yo' phone

40:22.179 --> 40:26.625
from my phone, and then
our phones will do it up.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.086
Is it ringing?

40:29.186 --> 40:31.046
Why isn't it ringing? Hello?

40:31.146 --> 40:32.423
You're 'em both up to...

40:32.523 --> 40:33.590
Yeah, well, I'm trying
to see which one...

40:33.690 --> 40:34.758
Yeah.

40:34.858 --> 40:35.968

40:36.068 --> 40:38.929

40:44.660 --> 40:46.611

Jake Winton's back.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.440
Come on, man, bring it in.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.233
Mm.
- Good seeing you, man.

40:51.333 --> 40:52.818
You too, man.
- That's a nice coat.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.070
Thanks.
- Looks like my mom's coat.

40:55.170 --> 40:56.280
It's a... it's a guy's coat.

40:56.380 --> 40:57.456

next semester.

No, we are very excited
about this class.

for my brother's depression.

What?
- on.

43:04.633 --> 43:07.119

confidence in the water,

43:07.219 --> 43:08.245

on this section.

43:31.651 --> 43:33.278
Another glass?

43:35.363 --> 43:37.699
Can I just have, like, that much?

43:39.075 --> 43:42.112
Fine, I'll just have
another glass, thanks.

43:42.212 --> 43:43.447
And you?

43:43.547 --> 43:45.457
Uh, yeah, I'll have a glass of that too.

43:54.382 --> 43:55.800
Thanks.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.882
I was kidding.

44:01.982 --> 44:03.925
This is the first time
anyone's ever served me alcohol

44:04.025 --> 44:05.218
in a restaurant ever.

44:05.318 --> 44:08.271
Wow.
- Are you gonna send it back?

44:09.314 --> 44:12.309
When I was your age,
I basically took my SATs drunk.

44:12.409 --> 44:14.811
What did you get?
- I got a 1600.

44:14.911 --> 44:16.480
And then I went to Columbia

44:16.580 --> 44:17.898
and was drunk there.

44:17.998 --> 44:19.608
So is this what you studied?

44:19.708 --> 44:22.402
College prep?
No, that wasn't my major.

44:22.502 --> 44:25.530
Poli-sci, and then I went
to NYU for law school.

44:25.630 --> 44:28.492
You're a lawyer?
- No, no, I...

44:28.592 --> 44:31.203
My mom got sick
in the last semester, so I came

44:31.303 --> 44:34.172
up here for a few weeks
and then I just never left.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.175
Yeah, shit.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.511
I'm sorry.

44:41.346 --> 44:45.058
You can have one sip,
and then finish that section.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.429

Are you a shoes-off house?

45:01.333 --> 45:02.651
I don't know.

45:02.751 --> 45:04.277
Hmm. Okay, where are the toys?

45:04.377 --> 45:07.114
They're in the living room.
Teddy, you can grab my neck,

45:07.214 --> 45:08.824
but you can't grab my neck skin.

45:08.924 --> 45:10.742
I can grab your neck skin!

45:10.842 --> 45:13.620
Okay, lesson learned.
Hi, Georgia.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.122

45:15.222 --> 45:16.415
Aw, she's shy today.

45:16.515 --> 45:17.791
That's okay.
Hey, Georgia,

45:17.891 --> 45:20.844

45:43.491 --> 45:45.827
Mmm.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.157
I feel like they take stuff out
just so that we have to put it away.

45:50.257 --> 45:52.701
They do have so many things.

45:52.801 --> 45:54.995
I know, like this fire truck,
I keep trying to hide

45:55.095 --> 45:57.005
from Teddy. He keeps finding it.

45:57.505 --> 46:01.801
And this? I tried to throw out,
but Georgia caught me.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.630
Oh, this thing is just gonna
keep playing.

46:05.730 --> 46:07.257

46:15.490 --> 46:17.601
Wait, I actually read this thing that

46:17.701 --> 46:20.771
if the kids take things and put them
between their thumb and two fingers,

46:20.871 --> 46:23.865
it's actually practice
for eventual writing skills.

46:26.743 --> 46:28.036
We should get a snack.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.456
Okay.

46:36.169 --> 46:37.704

- What?

What about the Supermanny?

46:39.639 --> 46:40.791
Armin?
- Yeah.

46:40.891 --> 46:42.383
That's just for when I'm bored.

46:46.846 --> 46:48.799
Wait, what about the kids?
Will they be okay?

46:48.899 --> 46:50.675
They're fine. That's the 'Elbow Song.'

46:50.775 --> 46:52.260
We have about ten more minutes.

46:52.360 --> 46:53.895

47:05.373 --> 47:10.787
Jean's son just got checked into rehab
for Internet gambling last week.

47:11.204 --> 47:12.864
Yeah, she's totally out to lunch.

47:12.964 --> 47:15.575
I left you a memo about this
three days ago.

47:15.675 --> 47:18.795
But, it's not what I want
to talk to you about.

47:21.256 --> 47:25.043
Listen, I had a conference
with Marley Benson's mom,

47:25.143 --> 47:28.964
and she said that she saw you
and Sarah Lipson

47:29.064 --> 47:33.852
at Theresa's Bakery,
and that you were both drinking.

47:34.811 --> 47:37.097
'Drinking' drinking?
- Drinking alcohol.

47:37.197 --> 47:38.473
Is she crazy?
- Well...

47:38.573 --> 47:40.608
She's a minor and I'm pregnant.

47:40.775 --> 47:42.936
I... I realize some of the moms

47:43.036 --> 47:46.030
like to manufacture the drama.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.191
Some of the moms are insane.

1:05:52.458 --> 1:05:54.068
No. No, no, no, no.

1:05:54.168 --> 1:05:56.111
You know what?
I love your eye shadow.

1:05:56.211 --> 1:05:57.696
Thanks!
- It's gorgeous.

1:05:57.796 --> 1:05:59.365
Oh, thank you. I love your hair.

1:05:59.465 --> 1:06:00.532
Oh, my God, thank you.

1:06:00.632 --> 1:06:01.617
It's incredible.

1:06:01.717 --> 1:06:02.952
I love your highlights.

1:06:03.052 --> 1:06:04.995
I did these myself.
- Really?

1:06:05.095 --> 1:06:06.664
Yeah. L'Oreal.
- This coat's from Old Navy.

1:06:06.764 --> 1:06:09.208
I always wanted to do highlights
but I'm always afraid...

1:06:09.308 --> 1:06:10.960
Don't want to miss the band.

1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:13.003
You didn't tell me
this was a date, by the way.

1:06:13.103 --> 1:06:14.296
This is gonna be a fun time.

1:06:14.396 --> 1:06:16.056
You know, I never go out.

1:06:58.732 --> 1:07:00.050
Stay sexy.

1:07:00.150 --> 1:07:02.928
That's not Toad the Wet Sprocket.
I know you think it is.

1:07:03.028 --> 1:07:04.479
But it's not.

1:07:08.650 --> 1:07:10.019
You want me to get you another
cran and soda?

1:07:10.119 --> 1:07:11.361
No, it's cool. I got it.

1:07:14.114 --> 1:07:16.984
Sorry, she just doesn't get out much.

1:07:17.084 --> 1:07:18.902
She's awesome.

1:07:19.002 --> 1:07:21.697
So, um, Georgia's dad,

1:07:21.797 --> 1:07:24.199
he said that he talked
to you the other day.

1:07:24.299 --> 1:07:27.494
Yeah, Teddy left his giraffe,
so I went and grabbed it.

1:07:27.594 --> 1:07:28.620
<i>Mm.</i>

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.789
So you got a giraffe and a job offer.

1:07:30.889 --> 1:07:31.999
That's cool.

1:07:32.099 --> 1:07:35.586
He said you were there for like an hour,
and that you were really impressive.

1:07:35.686 --> 1:07:38.464
Yeah, it's a finance job,
which is fucking boring.

1:07:38.564 --> 1:07:40.265
It's practically entry-level.

1:07:41.558 --> 1:07:43.719
You gonna take it?

1:07:43.819 --> 1:07:45.020
Uh, I am.

1:07:46.772 --> 1:07:48.599
You know, my cousin needs a job.

1:07:48.699 --> 1:07:51.777
Your sister should totally
hire her to take care of Teddy.

1:07:56.323 --> 1:07:59.026
What?

1:07:59.126 --> 1:08:02.621
I like having sex with you,
but I wasn't planning our wedding.

1:08:03.163 --> 1:08:04.498
Okay.

1:08:07.793 --> 1:08:09.745
You're not taking us seriously, are you?

1:08:09.845 --> 1:08:13.123
I know. I just...

1:08:13.223 --> 1:08:14.666
I thought that you were
taking me seriously

1:08:14.766 --> 1:08:17.928
and it made me feel better about my life.

1:08:19.596 --> 1:08:22.224
Oh. That's fucked up.

1:08:22.891 --> 1:08:23.892
Hmm.

1:08:25.268 --> 1:08:27.521
I'm gonna go play Asteroids.

1:08:28.313 --> 1:08:30.690
I'm gonna stay here and get drunk.

1:08:32.734 --> 1:08:34.486
That's cool. You do that.

1:08:38.615 --> 1:08:40.818
See, if you stay here,
you already have a girlfriend.

1:08:40.918 --> 1:08:42.653
She's not my girlfriend.

1:08:42.753 --> 1:08:44.246
<i>Okay, sensitivo.</i>

1:08:44.871 --> 1:08:46.031
I used to sneak in here.

1:08:46.131 --> 1:08:49.118
I used to want to be in here so badly.
How depressing is that?

1:08:49.218 --> 1:08:51.537
You know what?
I can't hear you mope anymore.

1:08:51.637 --> 1:08:52.879
Okay?

1:08:54.172 --> 1:08:56.375
Look.

1:08:56.475 --> 1:08:59.211
Pregnant Running Man.

1:08:59.311 --> 1:09:00.887
Stretching.

1:09:03.014 --> 1:09:05.058
Stretching.

1:09:07.185 --> 1:09:08.603
Come on.

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:10.722
You just came to drink?

1:09:10.822 --> 1:09:12.149
It's a bar.

1:09:13.859 --> 1:09:16.145
Well, we don't have to hang out.
Go and talk to your not girlfriend.

1:09:16.245 --> 1:09:17.521
She'll make you feel better.

1:09:17.621 --> 1:09:19.531
I'll feel better when
I get back to my life.

1:09:21.533 --> 1:09:23.735
There's a job in the city.
I'm gonna take it.

1:09:23.835 --> 1:09:25.904
You're gonna have to find
someone else to take care of Teddy.

1:09:26.004 --> 1:09:28.448
<i>Blanca said she know someone, so...</i>

1:09:28.548 --> 1:09:30.458
Just so you're prepared.

1:09:32.252 --> 1:09:33.628
Wow.

1:09:33.962 --> 1:09:35.797
That's great.

1:09:36.798 --> 1:09:38.041
You must be relieved.

1:09:38.141 --> 1:09:39.251
Don't make me feel bad.

1:09:39.351 --> 1:09:41.170
It's a real job. I have to take it.

1:09:41.270 --> 1:09:42.796
No, no. It's great.

1:09:42.896 --> 1:09:44.965
Could you just get me my juice?

1:09:45.065 --> 1:09:46.425
Okay, don't. Okay?

1:09:46.525 --> 1:09:48.302
If you say that you're gonna
get your own juice,

1:09:48.402 --> 1:09:50.262
then I believe that
that is what you're gonna do.

1:09:50.362 --> 1:09:52.014
Why are you getting like this?

1:09:52.114 --> 1:09:54.224
It's just, like, if you want me
to get you juice, just ask.

1:09:54.324 --> 1:09:56.393
But don't test me. I'm not Danny.

1:09:56.493 --> 1:09:58.896
Oh, thanks.

1:09:58.996 --> 1:10:01.823
Just, like, sleep with your husband, okay?
I'm not your problem.

1:10:04.117 --> 1:10:06.987
What? I never go out.

1:10:07.087 --> 1:10:08.163
Fuck you.

1:10:11.625 --> 1:10:13.994
So what, we're leaving?
- Yeah.

1:10:14.094 --> 1:10:16.705
Fine. Take the car.
I'll stay somewhere else.

1:10:16.805 --> 1:10:18.665
Right, where are you gonna go?
- I have friends.

1:10:18.765 --> 1:10:20.292
Really? Why didn't you stay with
them for the last three months?

1:10:20.392 --> 1:10:21.960
I've been here for almost three
months helping you.

1:10:22.060 --> 1:10:23.795
But I don't want that to be my whole life.

1:10:23.895 --> 1:10:26.965
Don't worry. It's not.

1:10:27.065 --> 1:10:28.675
People die. People are born.

1:10:28.775 --> 1:10:31.053
But the only reason you stick
around for more than two minutes

1:10:31.153 --> 1:10:32.221
is when you need something.

1:10:32.321 --> 1:10:33.889
I needed you to make me feel better.

1:10:33.989 --> 1:10:35.515
I had something real, and now it's gone.

1:10:35.615 --> 1:10:37.059
Don't talk to me
about how you had something real

1:10:37.159 --> 1:10:38.352
and now it's gone.

1:10:38.452 --> 1:10:40.520
<i>No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.</i>

1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:42.898
No one told you you had to
drop out of law school.

1:10:42.998 --> 1:10:43.815
She didn't ask you

1:10:43.915 --> 1:10:45.442
to come home and take care of her.
- Because she didn't have to.

1:10:45.542 --> 1:10:47.861
She said she didn't want me to interrupt
my life just because she was sick.

1:10:47.961 --> 1:10:49.488
We didn't even come close
to interrupting your life.

1:10:49.588 --> 1:10:51.823
If you had a dog, it would have
interrupted your life more than Mom dying.

1:10:51.923 --> 1:10:53.325
You don't think I wanted
to be there when she died?

1:10:53.425 --> 1:10:55.327
I called you. I called you
when we knew it was close.

1:10:55.427 --> 1:10:56.453
I told the nurse, I said,

1:10:56.553 --> 1:10:58.205
'Tell me when it's close,
I need to call my brother.

1:10:58.305 --> 1:10:59.289
We need to be here together.'

1:10:59.389 --> 1:11:00.874
I left you messages.

1:11:00.974 --> 1:11:02.000
I couldn't breathe.

1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:03.752
Dad was here. Danny was here.

1:11:03.852 --> 1:11:05.087
That's right, I'm an asshole
and Danny's a saint.

1:11:05.187 --> 1:11:06.713
I wanted you here.

1:11:06.813 --> 1:11:08.674
Me. I called you because I needed you.

1:11:08.774 --> 1:11:10.550
But you know what? It's fine.

1:11:10.650 --> 1:11:13.762
Because Danny held Mom's hand
with me until I was ready to let it go.

1:11:13.862 --> 1:11:15.722
Well, Danny's fucking around
with that real estate agent,

1:11:15.822 --> 1:11:17.274
but I'm glad he was there.

1:11:21.486 --> 1:11:22.862
I'm sorry.

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:24.531
I had to tell you.

1:11:34.165 --> 1:11:36.167
What... wait a second.

1:11:44.092 --> 1:11:45.794
Hey, baby. How's the concert?

1:11:45.894 --> 1:11:46.962
<i>Hey.</i>

1:11:47.062 --> 1:11:48.513
It's a girl.

1:11:50.890 --> 1:11:52.225
Wh...

1:11:57.355 --> 1:11:58.857
I'm sorry.

1:12:04.696 --> 1:12:06.906

You wouldn't believe what
happened here last Friday.

1:14:55.750 --> 1:14:56.860
This hooker hit a vein.

1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.195
Teddy, do you want to go to the park?

1:14:58.295 --> 1:14:59.279
No park!

1:14:59.379 --> 1:15:01.865
I mean, it bled everywhere.
- Come on, buddy.

1:15:01.965 --> 1:15:03.909
You want to stay in Hudson's
apartment all day?

1:15:04.009 --> 1:15:05.202
I have to go to the park.

1:15:05.302 --> 1:15:06.912
Yeah, well, he's going to the park

1:15:07.012 --> 1:15:08.830
for a different reason
than you're going to the park.

1:15:08.930 --> 1:15:10.924
Yeah, but two birds, right?
One stone.

1:15:12.884 --> 1:15:14.753
