WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.525
Previously onLegacies...You're the oracle.

00:03.568 --> 00:05.048
What's coming next?

00:05.092 --> 00:08.356
SPHINX:
A new hero rises...

00:08.399 --> 00:11.141
but can be felled
by the golden arrow.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.752
What if it is the one thing
that can kill a phoenix?

00:13.796 --> 00:16.016
Then you'll Superwoman in
and save the day,

00:16.059 --> 00:17.147
like you always do.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.019
SPHINX:
When time fractures...

00:20.107 --> 00:22.500
...the darkness overwhelms.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.936
You're full of black magic.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.155
This isn't you, Jo.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.374
JOSIE:
It is now.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.767
So get used to it.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.857
'Cause this look
is here to stay.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.642
Autem.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.879
ALARIC :
Attention, students.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.186
Please make your way
to morning assembly.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.279
Hey.

01:02.323 --> 01:05.413
You want to sit with Hope
and me at assembly today?

01:05.456 --> 01:07.197
Uh, yeah, sure.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.243
Cool, okay.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.598
Okay. Did you...?

01:19.949 --> 01:21.864
I know you are all worried.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.735
Believe me, no one is
more worried than I am.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.737
My daughter Josie
is still missing.

01:25.781 --> 01:29.785
But even as I speak, we're doing
everything we can to find her.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.395
Jed and the wolves are
attempting to track her.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.093
Kaleb and the vampires

01:33.136 --> 01:35.921
have compelled local police for
any help that they can provide.

01:35.965 --> 01:39.055
We will find her
and bring her home.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.057
That said, I just
want to reiterate,

01:41.101 --> 01:43.973
under no circumstance should
any of you approach her.

01:44.016 --> 01:47.629
While she is our family
and friend, she is under

01:47.672 --> 01:50.197
the influence
of black magic and...

01:50.240 --> 01:51.589
not herself.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.026
Your safety and Josie's

01:54.070 --> 01:56.420
is my top priority.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.423
I promise you
I will get through to her

01:59.467 --> 02:02.992
and bring back the Josie
we know and love safely.

02:03.035 --> 02:05.037
But first...

02:05.081 --> 02:07.823
we just have to find her.

02:11.043 --> 02:13.437
I'm right here, Dad.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.318
Well, don't look
so shocked.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.362
Did you
really think

02:25.406 --> 02:27.059
that I would miss my birthday?

02:31.238 --> 02:34.893
Oh, I'm sorry, ourbirthday.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.287
So...

02:37.331 --> 02:39.202
what did I miss?

02:42.249 --> 02:44.468
♪ All in my

02:44.512 --> 02:46.470
♪ All
in my ♪

02:46.514 --> 02:48.777
♪ Whoo♪♪ Jump

02:48.820 --> 02:52.868

03:05.272 --> 03:06.447
You multiplied

03:06.490 --> 03:07.926
like Gremlins.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.493
Supervillains need
a squad, too...

03:09.537 --> 03:11.234
with a little help
of a black magic

03:11.278 --> 03:12.235
suggestion spell.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.497
Can I talk

03:13.541 --> 03:14.585
to you for a sec?

03:14.629 --> 03:15.630
Without the squad.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.501
You guys know your assignments.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.460
Start prepping
my birthday bash without me.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.592
I'll catch up.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.333
♪ I wish that I could stop,
keep bailing... ♪

03:23.377 --> 03:25.161
Oh, that's not creepy at all.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.208
I need to make sure that my
party goes off without a hitch.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.470
About that.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.820
Happy birthday, Jo.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.691
To replace the one
I spilled root beer on,

03:33.735 --> 03:34.997
when I first got
to the school.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.956
I think that was the day
we became friends.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.090
You're never gonna give up
on the good inside of me,

03:41.133 --> 03:42.091
are you, MG?

03:42.134 --> 03:44.920
It's not my style.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.367
What the hell is wrong with you?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.282
Oh, wait your
turn, Kaleb.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.893
Plenty of hugs to go around.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.076
VARDEMUS:
This must be an extreme case.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.905
The order of the symbols
I've just prescribed

04:13.949 --> 04:17.431
will increase the box's
difficulty to its utmost level.

04:19.607 --> 04:20.999
And then I just

04:21.043 --> 04:22.436
point and shoot?

04:22.479 --> 04:24.264
Yes, merely open the box

04:24.307 --> 04:25.439
toward your subject and they

04:25.482 --> 04:26.744
will be sent
into the game.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.572
It's how
that scoundrel

04:28.616 --> 04:30.705
Clarke imprisoned me.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.620
Hmm, well, it sounds

04:32.663 --> 04:34.317
exactly like
what I'm looking for.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.493
Uh...

04:36.537 --> 04:37.668
thank you, Professor.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.104
Any time, Headmaster Saltzman.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.367
Come in.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.151
So that's your plan?

04:42.194 --> 04:43.805
To lock Josie in the box?

04:43.848 --> 04:46.590
Which you know she's fully
capable of controlling, right?

04:46.634 --> 04:49.419
Professor Vardemus assured me
she wouldn't be able to do that

04:49.463 --> 04:50.942
at this difficulty level.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.901
Plus, the box will keep her safe

04:52.944 --> 04:54.468
until Caroline and
I can figure out

04:54.511 --> 04:55.904
a way to help
her permanently.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.297
Yeah, but what
if she hurts someone

04:57.340 --> 04:58.733
before you do?
She just tried

04:58.776 --> 05:00.212
desiccating MG.And that's a good sign,

05:00.256 --> 05:01.257
because she's fully

05:01.301 --> 05:02.780
capable of doing worse.

05:02.824 --> 05:03.955
If anything, I
see that as proof

05:03.999 --> 05:05.783
that she can
still be reached.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.002
Yeah, well, I looked
in her freaky black eyes

05:07.045 --> 05:08.656
and I'm not so sure
about that, Doc.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.092
HOPE:
Look, we want
to help Josie,

05:10.135 --> 05:12.312
obviously, but we need
to keep the school safe.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.878
And the only way we can
do that is if we treat

05:13.922 --> 05:15.445
this like a monster problem.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.753
I just don't see it that way.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.799
We know.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.497
Gonna have to sit this one out.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.025
Okay, now what's the plan?

05:31.461 --> 05:33.289
Yo.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.943
Finally.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.814
I was trying to make
my wings do the...

05:36.858 --> 05:39.643
I haven't got the
hang of it yet, so...

05:40.601 --> 05:42.080
What happened?

05:42.124 --> 05:43.473
I-I don't know.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.909
I can't remember.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.172
That's a lot of blood.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.000
Dang.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.750
LANDON:
Hey.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.451
What was that?

06:04.494 --> 06:06.409
Talk to me, Raf.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.193
Okay, um...

06:08.237 --> 06:10.370
so I-I keep having these,
these flashes, right, bro?

06:10.413 --> 06:12.633
It's like bits
and like pieces of memory.

06:12.676 --> 06:13.721
Memories of what?

06:13.764 --> 06:15.157
This place.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.637
Look, that's-that's
why I left the scene.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.769
I just had
another one.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.205
And I think somebody
died here, Lan.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.685
Who?

06:21.729 --> 06:23.948
I don't know.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.428
But, um, um,

06:25.472 --> 06:28.779
I'm pretty sure I killed 'em.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.183
Okay, that settles it.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.533
My sister is
definitely a monster.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.884
Who else would decorate for
our birthday party with black?

06:46.928 --> 06:48.408
HOPE:
Shouldn't you be in, like,

06:48.451 --> 06:50.105
witness protection or something?

06:50.148 --> 06:52.629
If she still
wants to kill me,

06:52.673 --> 06:54.326
the safest place
I can be

06:54.370 --> 06:55.763
is right here next to you,

06:55.806 --> 06:57.242
so spill.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.070
I want to help you with whatever
plan you're cooking up.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.855
Okay, fine, but just,
like, keep it down.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.813
I don't want her to know
that we're up to anything.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.076
Up to what, exactly?

07:05.120 --> 07:08.123
Come on, guys, this is
all so unnecessary.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.213
If you have something
to ask me, go ahead.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.823
I don't bite.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.478
Then I will.
Where's Josie?

07:15.522 --> 07:17.437
I'm right here, silly.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.439
The real Josie, our Josie.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.745
So you mean Weak Josie?

07:21.789 --> 07:23.791
She's gone-- I thought
I made that very clear.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.663
Thanks to you,
selfish sissy.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.448
You're right, okay?

07:28.491 --> 07:29.884
I was selfish.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.104
If you just come back,
I'll try and change.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.498
You always try to change.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.587
And it never sticks.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.459
So, pass.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.938
Any other questions?

07:40.982 --> 07:43.288
HOPE: You said you came
back here for a reason.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.725
Because deep down,
you know that we can

07:44.768 --> 07:46.378
bring the good
inside of you out.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.250
You're right.

07:48.293 --> 07:51.296
I do have a reason.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.604
And now I have to ruin

07:54.648 --> 07:56.214
the surprise.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.483
LIZZIE:
Merging isn't even possible.

08:03.526 --> 08:04.962
We're not 22.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.529
Yeah, see, it turns out
that's just a guideline.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.531
Kind of like driving a car

08:08.575 --> 08:09.750
or smoking cigarettes.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.099
Nobody wants you to do it

08:11.142 --> 08:13.318
before you're old enough,
but you can.

08:13.362 --> 08:16.147
So I'll see you
both tonight?

08:16.191 --> 08:17.888
Finger foods at around 7:30ish

08:17.932 --> 08:19.803
and then the Merge at 8:00.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.892
Oh, and don't be late, Lizzie,

08:21.936 --> 08:24.460
or else I will have
to do something drastic.

08:42.870 --> 08:46.787
Lost Temple of Potest.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.921
And behind this wall, the elixir
of life that it protects.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.054
And salvation for my daughters.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.971
Sorry you didn't make it, pal.

08:57.014 --> 09:00.757
I'll be sure
to send you a postcard.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.856
I thought you
wanted to help.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.989
That was before I knew
that Josie wanted to merge,

09:15.032 --> 09:16.425
aka force a battle of wills

09:16.468 --> 09:18.906
where the winner literally
absorbs the loser...

09:18.949 --> 09:20.603
meaning me.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.084
Please, just hear her out.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.390
Because we can't help Jo
without you.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.832
Five minutes, Mikaelson.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.398
And this plan of yours

09:33.442 --> 09:36.532
had better include
a nuclear warhead.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.839
I'm making a potion...
Oh!

09:38.882 --> 09:39.883
Fizzy, refreshing.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.581
Not a nuke.
Lizzie?

09:41.624 --> 09:42.930
Please.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.498
Okay.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.370
Tell me about this potion.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.372
It will create a fortified
locality within your psyche

09:50.415 --> 09:51.591
when you merge.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.594
What do you mean "when"?

09:54.637 --> 09:56.683
Well, there's really no way
around that part.

09:56.726 --> 09:59.381
But if this works, it'll create
a safe space in your mind,

09:59.424 --> 10:03.080
divide Josie's consciousness
and yours when you absorb her.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.473
And after we detox her

10:04.516 --> 10:06.083
with a dark magic cleanse,
we'll be able

10:06.127 --> 10:08.390
to put Jo's mind
back into her body.

10:08.433 --> 10:12.437
And, uh, both of you
will be normal... ish.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.525
Okay, you said

10:13.569 --> 10:16.920
when I absorb her.

10:16.964 --> 10:20.576
Does this stupid plan
only work if I win?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.664
Technically, yes.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.971
But... we believe in you.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.451
Well, there's your first mistake
right there, okay?

10:26.495 --> 10:28.105
I am
my biggest fan and

10:28.149 --> 10:30.107
even I know that Lord Josiemort

10:30.151 --> 10:32.501
is gonna squash me like a bug.

10:32.544 --> 10:33.894
That's why I'm here.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.809
To clean up my bug guts?!

10:35.852 --> 10:37.941
No. To train you.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.945
Just...

10:41.989 --> 10:43.773
get in there.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.036
Focus, focus.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.559
You're not getting it.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.474
Honestly,
just better.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.872
It's okay.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.091
You've got this!

10:57.134 --> 10:58.048
You've got it!

10:58.092 --> 11:00.181
Yeah! That's right!

11:04.925 --> 11:06.317
Man!

11:06.361 --> 11:08.319
LIZZIE:
Seriously?

11:09.320 --> 11:12.149
The Merge is
a mental battle, MG,

11:12.193 --> 11:15.326
not Ninja Warrior
or whatever is in your head.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.807
W-Well, I can train
your brain, too.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.809
I'm all about mind over matter.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.724
Lizzie's right.
We need to find

11:21.768 --> 11:23.552
a witch that can help her.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.684
No need.

11:24.727 --> 11:25.859
If we want to find out

11:25.902 --> 11:27.817
if I'm strong enough to win,

11:27.861 --> 11:31.212
I know exactly
what witch can tell us.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.747
After her,
you wretched creation!

11:46.357 --> 11:48.795
We've got to get
a faster eyeball.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.231
But you mark my words, Chad,

11:50.274 --> 11:52.581
that Tribrid's
plotting something.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.410
Duh. Hope's always
got an awesome plan.

11:55.453 --> 11:58.369
Um, and somehow has time
for relationship stuff, too.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.763
Stop flapping your gums,
my reluctant acolyte.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.678
You're missing
the latest twist.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.468
It looks like our favorite
show's about to get canceled.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.906
JOSIE:
More like getting a spinoff.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.473
Uh...

12:15.517 --> 12:17.519
how are you...?

12:17.562 --> 12:18.563
Astral projection.

12:18.607 --> 12:19.564
Rad.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.784
A mere parlor trick.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.307
I agree.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.482
So...

12:24.526 --> 12:27.050
who the hell are you?

12:27.094 --> 12:29.923
I... am the Master

12:29.966 --> 12:31.968
of the Underworld!

12:32.012 --> 12:34.666
Ferryman of the Damned!

12:34.710 --> 12:36.625
Reaper of Souls!

12:36.668 --> 12:37.800
The...

12:37.844 --> 12:41.195
Almighty Necromancer!

12:45.677 --> 12:48.289
I thought you'd be taller.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.772
I'm Chad.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.512
Just Chad.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.255
JOSIE:
Let me get this straight.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.910
You two are the masterminds

13:00.954 --> 13:03.652
behind this whole...

13:03.695 --> 13:05.610
Malivore operation?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.351
Seriously?

13:07.395 --> 13:09.353
Uh, thanks
for coming to help us.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.791
Magically, I mean.VARDEMUS:
My pleasure.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.705
I know Headmaster Saltzman
is short on staff,

13:13.749 --> 13:16.883
so I'm happy to help you
with your homework assignment.

13:16.926 --> 13:20.147
Yeah, and, uh, this is what
you were talking about.Ah, yes.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.584
The plat en argent.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.326
One only needs to place
a drop of blood upon it,

13:25.369 --> 13:27.197
and the face of the person

13:27.241 --> 13:29.591
to whom that blood belongs
will appear.

13:29.634 --> 13:30.984
Great. Um...

13:31.027 --> 13:33.073
thanks again, Professor.

13:35.553 --> 13:38.078
He's a nice guy.
Bit gullible.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.993
Guess that's how Clarke
managed to trick him.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.429
Can we just get on with it?

13:43.648 --> 13:46.129
I need to know who I, um...Come on, dude.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.739
You didn't kill anyone.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.002
You don't know that, Lan.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.133
You wouldn't do
something like that,

13:50.177 --> 13:51.395
so as far as I'm concerned,

13:51.439 --> 13:52.919
there's no need
for this stupid test.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.224
Okay, uh, okay.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.097
I need to know one way
or the other. Right?

13:57.140 --> 13:59.099
Look, I wish that
I believed in myself

13:59.142 --> 14:00.883
as much as you...

14:00.927 --> 14:02.754
but I don't.

14:10.675 --> 14:11.720
Just don't worry.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.678
Whoever's face shows up
on that thing,

14:13.722 --> 14:15.289
they're gonna have answers.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.345
ALYSSA:
You're afraid.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.477
No.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.913
You're absolutely terrified.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.262
No crap.
I didn't need

14:32.306 --> 14:34.308
your stupid bowling ball
to tell me that, okay?

14:34.351 --> 14:35.831
Josie is basically
Darth Vader...

14:35.875 --> 14:37.920
Would you please shut up?
I need to concentrate.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.530
Thanks in advance.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.885
You're not scared
of Josie hurting you.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.451
You're scared of hurting her.

14:47.495 --> 14:50.411
I've done so much
to hurt her already.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.416
I just don't want to make
the same mistake again.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.114
You can open your eyes now,

14:58.158 --> 15:00.595
'cause you don't have
to worry about that.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.379
Really?
Hope's plan is gonna work?

15:02.423 --> 15:04.686
I don't need
a crystal ball to know

15:04.729 --> 15:05.817
that Josie...

15:05.861 --> 15:07.558
is gonna tear you apart.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.256
The Merge is
a battle of wills.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.345
The simple fact that
you're afraid of winning

15:11.388 --> 15:12.737
andlosing...

15:12.781 --> 15:14.565
makes you a dead duck.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.872
Are you seriously telling me

15:16.916 --> 15:18.961
that I'm going to die

15:19.005 --> 15:21.746
because I became
a better person?

15:21.790 --> 15:25.141
Ironic, isn't it?Well, in that case,

15:25.185 --> 15:26.882
screw personal growth, okay?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.929
I am going back
to looking out for number one.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.887
To being selfish.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.455
To hell with the Merge.That's the spirit.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.283
Live long and prosper, kid.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.415
She won't.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.289
And neither will you.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.554
JOSIE:
Hmm.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.556
Was that drastic enough for you?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.125
You...

15:52.168 --> 15:54.779
you killed her.And if you

15:54.823 --> 15:55.955
don't show up tonight,

15:55.998 --> 15:58.870
I'll start killing
your actual friends.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.785
Hmm?

16:21.328 --> 16:23.808
You're gonna stop her, right?

16:24.635 --> 16:25.897
That's what you do,
isn't it?

16:25.941 --> 16:27.377
Take out monsters?

16:27.421 --> 16:29.292
Okay, man, come on,
let's-let's get you some air,

16:29.336 --> 16:31.338
all right?

16:35.559 --> 16:37.822
Lizzie's car is gone.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.607
She bolted.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.439
Is she...?I knew Josie was dangerous--
I just didn't think

16:45.482 --> 16:48.703
that she was capable
of something like this.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.968
MG:
It's my fault.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.797
If I could've just
gotten through to her...

16:55.840 --> 16:56.928
Like I keep saying,

16:56.972 --> 16:58.669
there is no getting
through to her.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.671
We are not giving up on Josie.
The only way

17:00.715 --> 17:02.064
to protect the school is
to bring her back.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.501
Tell that to
Alyssa, Hope.If we give up now,

17:04.545 --> 17:05.589
she'll have died for nothing.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.374
So we have to stick to the plan.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.724
And you need to
bring Lizzie back.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.249
She needs you, MG.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.946
We all do.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.044
What are you doing?

17:25.087 --> 17:27.394
What you won't.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.224
Putting together

17:31.267 --> 17:32.877
a plan B.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.792
In case you're wrong.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.362
I can't let you do that.Yeah,

17:39.406 --> 17:41.799
and what are you gonna do
to stop me, Hope?

17:54.638 --> 17:55.770
Ah.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.119
Dr. Saltzman, I presume.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.338
Who's asking?

17:58.381 --> 17:59.948
I am Professor Hawkins.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.776
An archaeologist by trade.

18:01.819 --> 18:02.820
Uh-huh.

18:02.864 --> 18:03.865
Oh.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.258
Hello there.

18:05.301 --> 18:08.478
So... you're here
for the elixir, too, I presume.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.132
Yes.Yeah, well,

18:10.176 --> 18:12.700
sorry about that, but my
daughters' lives depend on it.

18:12.743 --> 18:16.530
Oh. Then perhaps fate
brought us together,

18:16.573 --> 18:19.489
as you will need assistance
getting over that wall.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.697
MG: It's a classic car.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.744
You might want to go
with the good stuff.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.356
You might want to stop
sneaking up on people

19:00.400 --> 19:01.966
when they're running
for their lives.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.015
Let me guess.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.060
Locator spell?

19:09.104 --> 19:10.975
Witches gonna witch.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.413
Well...

19:13.456 --> 19:14.805
let's have it.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.286
Your grandiose speech
to convince me

19:17.330 --> 19:19.680
to go back
and face my sister.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.248
But just know that I've had
that conversation with myself

19:22.291 --> 19:23.640
a thousand times.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.512
I know I'm
being selfish,

19:25.555 --> 19:27.340
but what am I
supposed to do?

19:27.383 --> 19:31.126
Let you drag me back to the
school so that I can die?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.693
Hey, that's not
why I'm here.

19:32.736 --> 19:35.565
Hope doesn't want
anyone else to get hurt.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.525
The way I see it,
that includes you.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.485
So, if you're running...

19:42.529 --> 19:44.792
I'm running, too.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.628
Hey.Hey.

19:54.671 --> 19:57.021
Do you have
a second to talk?

19:57.065 --> 19:58.371
I kind of need a favor.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.764
Um... uh, where's Raf?

20:00.808 --> 20:03.506
He said he was going out.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.291
Okay.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.075
That's weird.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.598
Why? Is something wrong?

20:08.642 --> 20:10.121
Uh, I don't know.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.210
Maybe. Although...

20:11.253 --> 20:13.647
I could ask you the same thing.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.823
I'm sorry.
I know I'm being weird.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.346
That therapy game made you think

20:17.390 --> 20:18.913
we're not destined
to be together.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.393
Raf told you.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.656
He's my best friend.I know.
I figured

20:22.699 --> 20:24.353
that he would.
I just...

20:24.397 --> 20:27.748
I didn't know how to have the
conversation with you myself.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.316
It's all good.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.710
But for future reference,
I'm not going anywhere.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.452
There's literally nothing
you can do to push me away.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.932
And it just
so happens

20:37.975 --> 20:42.110
I'm an immortal phoenix,
so you're kind of stuck with me.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.329
Forever.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.723
Okay.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.812
What do you need?I need to figure out

20:48.856 --> 20:50.814
a way to protect
both the school and Josie.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.121
I just don't know
if I can do both.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.470
I know you can.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.255
You always do.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.647
I'm glad you think that,

20:57.691 --> 21:00.389
because I actually need
your help with plan B.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.086
What's wrong with plan A?

21:03.740 --> 21:06.265
NECROMANCER:
It's party time, Stallions!

21:06.308 --> 21:08.092
Report to the gym, or else.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.746
Oh, my God.

21:12.662 --> 21:16.753
Vampires, witches
and werewolves.

21:16.797 --> 21:20.235
Children of all ages.

21:23.238 --> 21:26.285
It's the event
we've all been waiting for.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.852
The...

21:28.896 --> 21:30.593
Merge!

21:33.814 --> 21:35.816
I thought that guy was dead.

21:35.859 --> 21:38.558
Yeah, you like
the taste of cape?

21:38.601 --> 21:40.342
Eat that! Yeah!

21:42.431 --> 21:44.041
Yeah.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.347
In the crimson corner

21:45.391 --> 21:46.653
and robe,

21:46.696 --> 21:49.308
hailing from Mystic Falls,
Virginia,

21:49.351 --> 21:52.833
the former Queen
of Codependency,

21:52.876 --> 21:56.402
the reigning Sultan of Siphon,

21:56.445 --> 21:59.970
Josie Saltzman!

Houdini said the same thing.

22:44.275 --> 22:49.672
And in the blue corner,
the Queen of Mean,

22:49.716 --> 22:52.153

Well, my selfish sister

23:17.700 --> 23:19.354
didn't show up.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.183
Who am I gonna kill?

23:22.226 --> 23:23.314
Should it be...

23:23.358 --> 23:24.403
Ooh...

23:24.446 --> 23:25.665
...vampires?

23:25.708 --> 23:29.016
Maybe witches?

23:29.886 --> 23:32.367
How about some werewolves?

23:49.602 --> 23:52.300
Why not try all three?

23:59.655 --> 24:01.178
LIZZIE: Are you sure
that you're up for this?

24:01.222 --> 24:03.485
It isn't exactly what
the Green Flashlight would do.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.096
First of all, it's Green
Lantern, and you know it.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.490
Just like you know way
too many hobbit insults

24:08.534 --> 24:10.623
to not be a secret Tolkien fan.

24:10.666 --> 24:11.972
And second,

24:12.015 --> 24:14.670
I'm-I'm done playing hero.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.933
Alyssa died.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.330
And I couldn't help her.

24:25.638 --> 24:28.597
Does Superman always
save the day?

24:28.641 --> 24:30.643
Pretty much.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.863
But that's a comic book,
and this is real.

24:33.907 --> 24:38.433
I was stupid to think
that I could make a difference.

24:40.304 --> 24:45.875
If you tell anyone that I read
nerd porn, I will deny it.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.051
But if I
hypothetically did,

24:48.095 --> 24:51.272
I would gather that the
true test of a hero

24:51.315 --> 24:55.189
isn't being strong
when it's easy.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.974
It's being strong
when it's hard.

24:59.541 --> 25:05.634
If you believed that, you
wouldn't need this road map.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.810
Well, I'm not a hero, either.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.333
Heroes are selfless.

25:09.377 --> 25:12.554
And that cape
doesn't fit me.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.469
Then why haven't we left?

25:16.340 --> 25:17.777
LIZZIE:
Damn it.

25:17.820 --> 25:22.433
Life was so much easier
when I only cared about myself.

25:22.477 --> 25:23.783
And you totally lied to me.

25:23.826 --> 25:24.914
You definitely came

25:24.958 --> 25:26.437
to convince me to face Josie.

25:26.481 --> 25:27.743
When I told you

25:27.787 --> 25:29.353
that I would come with you,
I meant it.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.878
I just trusted that you would
make the right decision.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.055
Double damn it.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.539
KALEB:
Face it, old chap.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.931
Your plan isn't working.

25:41.975 --> 25:44.499
How long have you been at it?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.502
Not as long as that guy.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.199
Oh. Right.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.072
An impossible task
for a solitary man.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.683
But not if we work together.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.598
You expect me to trust you?

25:56.642 --> 25:58.078
No. Merely trust
that my mates

25:58.121 --> 26:00.559
are expecting me to bring
that elixir back, too.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.864
And if we make it over the wall?

26:01.908 --> 26:02.952
We split the prize
down the middle.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.127
Yeah, half may not be enough

26:04.171 --> 26:05.651
to save my daughters.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.348
Perhaps.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.785
However, returning empty-handed
surely won't.

26:09.829 --> 26:12.353
Either let me
help you,

26:12.396 --> 26:14.398
or draw your firearm
and shoot me.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.709
I hate snakes.

26:20.753 --> 26:23.886
Let's hope you're not
one, Mr. Hawkins.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.279
Professor Hawkins.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.115
What are you staring at?

26:35.942 --> 26:39.641
"Sociis."

26:39.685 --> 26:42.644
Sociis. So...

26:42.688 --> 26:44.777
Sociis.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.561
Kaleb.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.782
Yes. H-How do you know
my given name?

26:49.825 --> 26:53.394
The same way I know you're not
British or an archaeologist.

26:53.437 --> 26:54.134
I'm not what?

26:54.177 --> 26:56.136
I remember everything.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.834
Including how we get
out of here.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.807
What are you doing?

27:15.808 --> 27:18.158
You wouldn't
understand.

27:20.726 --> 27:24.817
I am maybe the only person
who could understand.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.950
Look, man, I don't
know what's going on.

27:27.994 --> 27:31.301
Whatever you did,
I'll stand by you.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.129
All in. There's no one
you could have hurt.

27:33.173 --> 27:35.131
There's nothing you could
have done that would

27:35.175 --> 27:36.567
make me turn my back on you.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.614
There's one thing.

27:52.801 --> 27:55.064
What is this?Someone did die

27:55.108 --> 27:57.327
by that tree, Lan.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.289
Um, it was me.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.471
Let's go!

28:16.346 --> 28:20.133
Lecutio Maxima! Scutum!

28:26.400 --> 28:28.097
One, two...

28:28.141 --> 28:29.751
How did you even get here?

28:29.795 --> 28:32.232
Oh, you survive this, I'll
tell you the whole story.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.016
Ah.This isn't any fun.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.539
You're not even
fighting back.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.628
Neither are you. I know
that you're in there, Josie.

28:37.672 --> 28:40.022
Give it up, Hope. What's it
gonna take to get it through

28:40.066 --> 28:43.809
to your thick wolf skull
that I'm Josie now?

28:43.852 --> 28:45.506
Incendia!

28:47.334 --> 28:49.902
You are not Josie.

28:49.945 --> 28:51.338
I know that you think
she's weak,

28:51.381 --> 28:55.168
but I know the truth--
she's strong. You're strong.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.866
No one could shoulder
the burdens that you carry.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.215
And you're always there

28:59.259 --> 29:00.739
for your friends
when they need you.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.566
So, please, Jo,
we really need you right now.

29:02.610 --> 29:05.134
Enough of this drivel!

29:05.178 --> 29:07.746
What are you waiting for?
Kill the Tribrid.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.749
Shut up. Everybody, shut up!

29:10.792 --> 29:14.665
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

29:17.886 --> 29:20.062
Hope?

29:20.106 --> 29:22.064
Jo, is that you?

29:24.545 --> 29:26.634
Mm.

29:29.637 --> 29:33.206
Did you really think
that you'd be the one

29:33.249 --> 29:35.338
that would bring out
my good side?

29:35.382 --> 29:37.993
I don't even think
she likes you.

29:39.081 --> 29:40.691
Ascendo.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.919
So, any last words
for your tombstone?

29:50.963 --> 29:53.574
I know you're in there,
Josie. Fight.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.492
Mm.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.195
I should have
mentioned this earlier.

30:07.153 --> 30:10.678
But black really
isn't your color.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.291
You're late to your own funeral.

30:15.335 --> 30:20.819
No. I am right on time
to kick your ass.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.268
This stupid potion of
yours is gonna work, right?

30:35.311 --> 30:37.009
Because it tasted like feet.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.011
It will if you win.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.100
Thanks for coming back.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.319
Like I had a choice.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.887
Dirty trick, sending
Jiminy Cricket after me.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.585
You would've done the right
thing if I was here or not.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.153
Now siphon me.
You got to be at full strength.

my Merge on until I know that

31:17.310 --> 31:19.573
the rest of the school is safe.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.185
Everyone out. Now.

31:23.229 --> 31:27.276

Let's go. Come on.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.235
Move.For the record,

31:29.278 --> 31:32.064
this huge act of selflessness
fully cancels out

31:32.107 --> 31:34.849
all of my
previous misdeeds.

31:41.247 --> 31:43.292
Enough of this foreplay.

for the main event.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.209
Mm.

31:47.253 --> 31:48.732
You have no idea

31:48.776 --> 31:50.473
how long I've been
waiting for this.

31:50.517 --> 31:53.215
Apparently,
not long enough to think

31:53.259 --> 31:55.217
of something clever to say.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.059
BOTH:
Sanguinem desimilus,

32:11.103 --> 32:14.845
sanguinem generis fiantus.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.978

32:20.155 --> 32:21.156
Sanguinem...

32:21.200 --> 32:22.766
You really think she can win?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.072
If she can't,

32:24.116 --> 32:26.074
let's pray plan B works.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.859
...sanguinem generis fiantus.

32:28.903 --> 32:31.036

32:39.827 --> 32:42.003
Sanguinem desimilus...

32:42.047 --> 32:43.352
Is she winning?

32:43.396 --> 32:45.311
I don't know.

32:45.354 --> 32:48.444
What does that even mean?

32:49.706 --> 32:52.274
You can't be dead.
That doesn't make any sense.

32:52.318 --> 32:55.016
Not the blood,
the flashes,

32:55.060 --> 32:56.757
or what I saw in the game.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.498
And it definitely
didn't make sense

32:58.541 --> 33:01.588
when I saw my face
on that platter.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.460
But then I heard his
voice on the intercom,

33:04.504 --> 33:06.462
and then it clicked.

33:06.506 --> 33:09.291
It all came back to me.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.293
I remembered.

33:16.255 --> 33:20.737
I got attacked coming back from my dad's, Lan.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.826
I fought.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.176
Then I ran.

33:50.376 --> 33:51.986
The Necromancer

33:52.030 --> 33:53.553
killed me, Lan.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.252
And that means if he--
if he brought me back,

33:57.296 --> 33:58.775
then I'm...

33:58.819 --> 34:01.735
I don't know-- I'm one
of his puppets, like Cassie was,

34:01.778 --> 34:03.519
and he can use
me to hurt you

34:03.563 --> 34:06.522
and anyone else that he wants.No.

34:06.566 --> 34:07.915
I refuse to believe any of this.

34:17.229 --> 34:19.796
Do you feel a heartbeat?

34:25.106 --> 34:27.326
I'm already gone.

34:35.421 --> 34:37.249
Well, I can't let you do this.

34:39.468 --> 34:42.602
That's the thing.

34:42.645 --> 34:47.085
I had all the time I needed
to do it before you got here.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.699
But it's like
he won't let me.

34:55.441 --> 34:58.531
It's like The
Necromancer's in control.

35:01.534 --> 35:05.103
So I need you
to take care of it for me.

35:06.408 --> 35:07.975
Take care of...

35:09.672 --> 35:12.762
You mean to kill you? Uh...

35:15.156 --> 35:17.289
Absolutely not.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.727
You're my brother.

35:20.770 --> 35:23.556
And I don't have free will, Lan.

35:24.992 --> 35:28.300
And you do.
You do.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.826
Don't let me be a puppet, man.

35:38.353 --> 35:41.182
You have free will.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.793
Use it.

35:45.665 --> 35:48.015
Please.

35:49.059 --> 35:49.973
...desimilus...

35:50.017 --> 35:51.323
...generis...

35:51.366 --> 35:54.326
...sanguinem generis fiantus.

36:10.472 --> 36:12.213
Hope, I can't really do this
right now.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.954
Landon. Lan,
what's happening?

36:13.997 --> 36:15.825
Plan B.

36:20.526 --> 36:21.875
Get away from them.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.534
KALEB:
Alyssa? How?

36:28.577 --> 36:32.538
She made a powerful
new friend.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.235
You.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.497
You're responsible
for this.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.630
As much as I
lovepayback,

36:37.673 --> 36:40.589
this was all the
birthday girl's idea.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.504
Girls.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.202
God. Girls.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.204
No, no. I know.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.509
Oh.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.512
Don't cry, Dad.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.342
One less mouth to feed.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.310
This morning, I told you
that we would all be okay,

37:05.353 --> 37:07.312
that we'd...

37:07.355 --> 37:09.575
get Josie back.

37:12.055 --> 37:13.492
I-I was wrong.

37:13.535 --> 37:17.496
Because the Josie
that we loved is gone.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.805
So is Lizzie.

37:22.849 --> 37:26.548
NECROMANCER:
See? Your sister is no more.

37:26.592 --> 37:29.551
Satisfied?

37:41.433 --> 37:43.391
How'd I do?

37:43.435 --> 37:44.740
I bought every word of it.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.481
If Jed's right
about the spy in our midst,

37:46.525 --> 37:47.917
hopefully they did, too.Yeah.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.267
MG:
It won't be long now,

37:49.310 --> 37:51.965
if it worked.

37:56.448 --> 37:59.277
Oh, thank God.

38:00.930 --> 38:02.410
Yeah.

38:02.454 --> 38:03.411
KALEB:
Got to give it to Hope.

38:03.455 --> 38:04.412
Hell of a plan.

38:04.456 --> 38:05.935
I love you guys.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.285
Okay, I'm sorry.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.374
Dad, what's going on?

38:09.417 --> 38:10.549
You're alive, sweetheart.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.115
And that's all
that matters right now.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.726
That means that I won,

38:13.769 --> 38:16.206
that-that I...Josie's fine.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.557
She thinks she won.
But, uh,

38:18.600 --> 38:20.428
Hope had a plan B.

38:20.472 --> 38:21.995
The potion she made

38:22.038 --> 38:24.954
wasn't just to keep your mind
separate from Jo's.

38:24.998 --> 38:29.132
It linked your life
to Landon's temporarily.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.570
So when you died,
he died, too.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.311
But since he's immortal,

38:33.354 --> 38:35.704
you came back when he did.

38:35.748 --> 38:36.705
ALARIC:
Hope thinks
we can get

38:36.749 --> 38:37.793
Josie back.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.186
How?

38:39.229 --> 38:40.796
That's where your boy MG
came in the clutch.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.320
Calm down.

38:42.363 --> 38:43.756
MG:
I helped Hope do

38:43.799 --> 38:46.367
an old-fashioned
vampire head dive.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.935
That's why you had
to go through with the Merge.

38:48.978 --> 38:51.372
Hope needed Josie
to be vulnerable.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.636
Josie's shields were down,
so I sent Hope

38:54.680 --> 38:56.334
into Josie's mind.

38:56.377 --> 38:58.074
And then I juked her out
of there

38:58.118 --> 39:00.033
before anybody knew
what we were doing.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.211
Why didn't anyone tell me?

39:04.254 --> 39:05.865
Hope couldn't risk
Josie figuring out the plan

39:05.908 --> 39:07.519
when the two of your minds
melded in the Merge.

39:07.562 --> 39:10.173
MG:
Plus, we knew you weren't
gonna run away for real.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.393

39:12.437 --> 39:14.743
even when it's hard, right?

39:19.531 --> 39:20.836
So...

39:20.880 --> 39:24.449
Hope's in Josie's mind?

39:24.492 --> 39:26.015
Yeah. There's, um,

39:26.059 --> 39:27.016
more...

39:27.060 --> 39:27.974
to that.

39:37.026 --> 39:38.376
Lizzie,

39:38.419 --> 39:39.681
till Hope comes back,

39:39.725 --> 39:41.161
no one else can
know you're alive.

39:41.204 --> 39:44.338
The Necromancer's
spying on us, so...

39:44.382 --> 39:45.905
we have to play to his camera.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.477
I can't believe
Lizzie's dead.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.565
You got what
you wanted.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.436
Now it's my turn.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.308
Let's use that dark magic
coursing through you

39:58.352 --> 40:00.093
for a higher purpose:

40:00.136 --> 40:02.704
to raise and control
Malivore himself.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.227
Are you sure
you want to do that?

40:04.271 --> 40:07.753
If we raise him and he gets
his dirty hands on Landon,

40:07.796 --> 40:09.319
he'd be invincible.

40:09.363 --> 40:11.539
Don't worry.

40:11.583 --> 40:15.238
I have plans for
Mr. Kirby.

40:15.282 --> 40:18.285
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.419
So, you gonna tell me

40:21.462 --> 40:22.898
what that was all about?

40:22.942 --> 40:25.161
Um, Hope needed a plan B.

40:25.205 --> 40:28.556
We'll find one for
you, too. I promise.
