00:20.360 --> 00:22.749
-Well done, Jonathan.
-Thank you, Admiral.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.677
I've been told
that people are calling us heroes.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.076
When it comes to my crew,
you won't get any argument from me.

00:50.120 --> 00:54.432
But I think it's important
that we remember...

00:55.800 --> 00:57.631
the heroes who aren't with us.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.118
The 27 crewmen
who didn't make it back.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.108
Without their sacrifice,
I wouldn't be standing here right now.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.279
None of us would.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.679
But I'm sure I speak
on behalf of my entire crew when I say...

01:17.280 --> 01:18.759
it's good to be home.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.549
It's been a long road

01:32.600 --> 01:34.272
Gettin' from there to here

01:34.400 --> 01:36.277
It's been a long time

01:38.160 --> 01:41.436
But my time is finally near

01:41.920 --> 01:45.549
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:46.160 --> 01:48.799
I will touch the sky

01:49.360 --> 01:52.716
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:53.120 --> 01:56.157
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:56.320 --> 01:59.835
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:00.640 --> 02:03.632
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:03.760 --> 02:07.673
I've got faith to believe

02:08.039 --> 02:11.032
I can do anything

02:11.160 --> 02:14.914
I've got strength of the soul

02:15.480 --> 02:18.313
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:18.440 --> 02:22.399
I can reach any star

02:23.800 --> 02:25.677
I've got faith

02:27.640 --> 02:30.393
I've got faith

02:31.320 --> 02:34.596
Faith of the heart

02:58.800 --> 02:59.789
Excuse me.

03:00.920 --> 03:01.909
Scotch.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.554
The bar's reserved
for regular customers.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.148
Galactic heroes have to sit at a table.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.351
I heard about your promotion.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.628
-Congratulations, Captain.
-Thanks.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.158
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.990
So what was it like in the Expanse?

03:32.240 --> 03:34.913
You'll be at the debriefing tomorrow,
won't you?

03:35.480 --> 03:37.755
I wouldn't want to spoil any surprises.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.634
Besides, I've got
more important questions.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.395
Seen any good movies
while I was gone?

03:46.200 --> 03:50.318
Another World War III epic.
It swept all the awards.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.797
But you haven't missed much.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.594
Earth's been holding its breath
for the past year...

03:57.720 --> 04:01.110
wondering if the Xindi were gonna
come back and finish the job.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.559
On the bright side, there've been more
weddings and births than ever before.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.199
I don't see a ring.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.317
I'm married to Starfleet just like you.

04:17.959 --> 04:18.949
Come in.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.796
Well, it looks like you're taking
enough clothes to last a year.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.709
You wanted something?

04:27.840 --> 04:30.798
I told the Captain I wanted to
stay aboard and supervise the refit...

04:30.920 --> 04:33.036
but he suggested I take a break.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.077
More like an order, actually.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.995
Problem is, I'm not sure where to go.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.433
Lizzie's gone,
my hometown doesn't exist anymore.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.472
Guess this is my home now.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.399
-You could come with me.
-To Vulcan?

04:53.040 --> 04:55.031
The transport leaves at 1100.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.279
Where would I stay?

04:58.800 --> 05:01.109
There's a guest room
in my mother's home.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.559
Your mum's house?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.477
What does she know about me?

05:08.880 --> 05:09.835
About us?

05:12.120 --> 05:13.758
I've never mentioned you.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.948
So, you'd introduce me as....

05:17.080 --> 05:18.991
Commander Charles Tucker III.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.511
You've told the Captain
that you don't get to see...

05:22.640 --> 05:27.191
as many alien cultures as you'd like.
You've never been to Vulcan.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.637
1100? I'd better start packing.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.999
We've tied these stations directly
into the primary EPS junction.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.516
I hope you don't mind
if I steal some of these improvements.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.755
I won't say anything,
if you do me a small favour.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.151
My senior officer candidates,
I'd like to get your opinion.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.316
You've served with a few of them.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.637
You might want to talk to someone
about installing a lumbar support.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.433
You're gonna spend a lot of hours
in that chair.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.158
We've improved hull polarisation
by 12%.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.396
We'll be able to hang in a fire-fight
a little longer.

06:16.520 --> 06:21.116
Ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers,
pulsed phase-cannons.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.078
Upgrades you recommended.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.155
What is it?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.360
I had an argument once
with Captain Jefferies.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.948
He was one of the designers
of the NX-Class.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.473
I'm aware of that.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.998
I told him I didn't wanna be in command
of a warship trying to make...

06:39.560 --> 06:41.516
first contact with new species.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.393
Jefferies was right.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.033
We needed those weapons
and a hell of a lot more.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.629
The asteroids were loaded
with trellium ore.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.957
We think the Vulcans entered the field
in order to mine it.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.675
Trellium?

07:04.960 --> 07:07.997
It's an alloy that protects
against spatial anomalies.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.112
Ships in the Expanse
used it to insulate their hulls.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.069
Your log reflects that
when you boarded the Seleya...

07:15.840 --> 07:18.912
that you found the crew
in a "delusional, violent state."

07:19.280 --> 07:21.475
They attacked us the minute we docked.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.910
The trellium had a toxic effect
on the Vulcans.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.111
Damaged their neural pathways.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.913
They lost the ability
to suppress their emotions.

07:30.360 --> 07:34.273
According to your log, the entire crew
of the Seleya was killed...

07:34.400 --> 07:36.755
when you triggered a reactor breach.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.668
The breach was an accident. We were
trying to disable their power grid.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.998
As far as I can determine, you didn't try
to save a single Vulcan crewman.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.714
There was no point.
They were too far gone.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.910
Is that your medical opinion, Captain?

07:53.280 --> 07:55.157
Phlox made that determination.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.834
Our specialists have examined
the data you sent back.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.873
It's far from certain that the neurological
damage was irreversible.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.355
There was nothing
we could do for them.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.074
T'Pol was exposed to the trellium.
She recovered.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.679
I couldn't help them.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.799
There's no need
to get emotional, Captain.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.674
You spent several hours
in the ship's auxiliary control room.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.917
In that time, did you try
to access the internal sensors...

08:24.040 --> 08:26.679
or download the computer database?

08:27.840 --> 08:28.829
No.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.589
So in effect, we don't know what
really happened aboard the Seleya.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.239
What the hell does that mean?

08:34.360 --> 08:37.875
Because of this oversight, we'll never
have a complete picture of the events...

08:38.000 --> 08:39.479
that led to the ship's destruction.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.511
I just told you exactly what led
to the ship's destruction.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.595
Captain.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.673
I'm not gonna sit here and be accused
of murdering those people.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.597
No one is accusing you
of anything, Captain.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.269
Maybe that crew'd still be alive
if you'd been a little more helpful.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.594
I beg your pardon?

08:53.720 --> 08:56.632
You did everything you could
to sabotage our mission.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.797
I got more help from the Andorians
than I ever got from the High Command!

08:59.920 --> 09:00.875
That's enough, Captain.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.878
This planet would be a cloud of dust
right now if we'd listened to you!

09:04.000 --> 09:05.149
That's enough!

09:08.200 --> 09:12.034
-How can you be taking his side?
-I am not taking anyone's side.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.115
You were out of line.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.639
They don't lift a finger to help us...

09:14.760 --> 09:17.797
and now I have to justify myself
to that son of a bitch?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.678
The debriefing's on hold indefinitely.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.233
I want you to take some time off
to clear your head.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.511
With all due respect, Admiral,
I don't need a vacation.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.038
That's an order, Captain!

09:38.640 --> 09:39.440
Lieutenant, if you wouldn't mind.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.998
Lieutenant, if you wouldn't mind.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.710
Not exactly travelling light, are you?

09:47.480 --> 09:48.469
Thank you.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.031
Why leave the comforts of home,
when you can take it all with you?

09:52.160 --> 09:53.115
Okay.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.912
I trust you'll be taking
the proper precautions on the surface.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.918
-What do you mean?
-I'm surprised you haven't heard.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.948
An Andorian and two Rigelians
were attacked.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.429
Attacked? Why?

10:07.360 --> 10:10.432
Apparently the Xindi incident
has caused a degree of xenophobia.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.516
It's hard to believe in this day and age.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.632
I'm told the Vulcans are staying behind
the walls of their compound.

10:15.760 --> 10:20.436
Well, I'm not going to let a few isolated
incidents disrupt my vacation plans.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.990
I lived on Earth for many years
before coming aboard Enterprise.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.873
I don't think this is the same planet
you remember, Doctor.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.195
People are looking for
someone to blame...

10:30.320 --> 10:31.548
and they don't care who it is.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.875
I appreciate your concern,
but I'll be fine.

10:34.000 --> 10:34.989
Would you?

10:56.480 --> 10:58.675
Mind if I ask what you're doing here?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.918
You know better
than to go climbing without a partner.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.308
What about that volcano we saw
on the way down, Mount Tar'ana?

11:17.960 --> 11:20.110
-Tar'hana.
-ls it still active?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.551
There are frequent eruptions.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.077
We can schedule a tour of the crater,
if you're interested.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.359
Volcanoes, ancient ruins, fire plains...

11:33.240 --> 11:35.037
I'm not sure where to start.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.911
So this is where you grew up.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.238
It's not like I imagined.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.509
-Meaning?
-Well, it's beautiful.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.358
Vulcans appreciate beauty.

11:48.760 --> 11:52.309
Well, I had no doubt about that.
You always were a snazzy dresser.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.071
Commander Tucker, I suggest....

11:59.440 --> 12:01.954
You didn't tell me
you were bringing a guest.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.871
-Mother, you're home.
-Obviously.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.879
It's agreeable to see you.
You appear well.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.792
I'm Charles Tucker.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.754
You both must be very tired
after your journey.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.473
The guest room is
on the south end of the house.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.157
It's not yet midday. Why aren't you
at the Science Academy?

13:05.840 --> 13:07.876
I'm no longer an instructor there.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.756
I wrote you a letter.
Didn't Starfleet transmit it to your ship?

13:12.480 --> 13:15.199
We had communication difficulties
in the Expanse.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.076
I don't know why you're surprised.
This was planned years ago.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.034
There's more to life
than one's profession.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.476
Perhaps you'll learn that one day.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.756
It seems that I'm not the only one
who knew you were coming.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.517
You received this yesterday.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.194
It's from Koss.

13:52.960 --> 13:57.272
Did you believe he had forgotten you?
You're going to respond.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.556
-I have nothing to say to Koss.
-He's your fiancé.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.874
Former fiancé.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.117
That is a matter for debate.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.514
It would be wise for you
to speak with him.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.710
You probably don't wanna hear this, but
I got a call from my brother yesterday.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.956
They renamed my old high school
after you.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.753
-How many is that, two, three dozen?
-I'm not counting.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.552
That's just North America.

14:24.720 --> 14:28.349
I don't think Zefram Cochrane
has that many schools named after him.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.317
So did you get a chance
to look them over?

14:39.440 --> 14:42.432
-Look what over?
-My senior officer candidates.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.711
Any suggestions for Tactical?

14:45.320 --> 14:49.996
You may wanna find someone
with more field experience, a MACO.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.390
I'm not sure how I feel
about a military officer on the Bridge.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.399
If I were you, I'd talk to General Casey
about assigning an entire squad.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.598
Things have changed
since Enterprise left Spacedock.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.672
You'll spend a lot of your time
boldly going into battle.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.315
Don't you think
you're being a little cynical?

15:17.440 --> 15:20.796
-Did you read my reports?
-Yes, Captain, I did.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.755
Hey.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.149
Mountain lion.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.752
Tracks are a few days old.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.716
Good thing I have you to protect me.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.509
Come in.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.755
Good morning.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.829
-What time is it?
-0400.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.509
You're kidding.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.474
We have to prepare the morning meal.
As guests, it's expected of us.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.754
The nah'ru vines
have bloomed early this year.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.150
I've had ample time to attend to them.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.194
It sounds as if
you're not enjoying retirement.

16:23.480 --> 16:26.358
You still haven't told me
the reason for your visit.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.476
I didn't know one was necessary.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.397
I thought perhaps you'd decided
to rejoin the High Command.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.875
I've been offered a commission
with Starfleet.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.754
If I accept, it could be several years
before I'm able to return home.

16:46.400 --> 16:50.518
The gespar isn't fresh.
My stasis unit needs to be replaced.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.275
Well, I'd be happy to take a look at it.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.879
If I can recalibrate a warp reactor...

16:56.000 --> 16:58.719
I ought to be able to
handle a kitchen appliance.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.672
My daughter's always been fascinated
by alien worlds.

17:04.359 --> 17:07.477
She was all too eager to finish
her schooling and leave Vulcan.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.909
As I recall, you encouraged me to leave.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.156
A mother is expected
to push her young out of the nest.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.669
At some point,
they're supposed to return.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.949
I'm told that on Earth, a human child
chooses their own path in life.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.153
They put their own wishes
ahead of their family's.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.717
That's true for the most part.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.949
You've learnt much from them,
haven't you?

17:29.640 --> 17:33.428
A Starfleet posting is no less important
than one with the High Command.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.877
I'm sure Father would've approved.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.675
Your father believed that our work
should enrich Vulcan society.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.156
-Earth is supposed to be our ally.
-What's happened to you?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.275
We shouldn't argue in front of a guest.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.119
Well, thank you.
That is very kind of you to say.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.750
Unfortunately,
we can't actually give tours of the ship.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.909
If that policy ever changes,
you two will be the first to know.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.432
You had to wear that jacket.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.632
Do you think I wore this jacket
to attract attention?

18:15.560 --> 18:19.155
-How's your drink?
-Delicious, thank you.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.431
Because I heard someplace
your people didn't like alcohol.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.551
You may be thinking of Vulcans.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.879
You know, you're right.
I get your species mixed up all the time.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.549
Is there something
we can help you with?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.717
I'm just trying to make sure
your friend here is comfortable.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.799
Sitting in a bar full of so many
strange-looking "aliens" like us.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.559
I'm quite comfortable.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.198
Because if you weren't...

18:45.320 --> 18:47.629
if humans make you nervous
for some reason...

18:47.760 --> 18:50.115
the Vulcan Consulate's
on the other side of the bridge.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.708
I'll bet there's someplace there
where someone like yourself...

18:52.840 --> 18:55.070
could get a nice, refreshing beverage.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.356
Well, perhaps we should be
on our way?

18:58.480 --> 19:00.357
We're not going anywhere, Doctor.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.710
If your friend wants to go,
you should let him go.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.070
You're not chasing anyone out of here.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.439
You Starfleet people
are the real problem.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.039
You fly all around space...

19:10.160 --> 19:12.390
telling every species you meet
where to find Earth.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.149
Did it ever occur to you that might not
be the smartest thing to do?

19:16.520 --> 19:17.669
Sir...

19:18.360 --> 19:21.272
why don't you just go back to the bar?

19:22.120 --> 19:25.715
Excuse me, Admiral,
I don't take orders from you.

19:25.840 --> 19:29.150
You heard him.
Step away from the table.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.078
Gentlemen, please.

20:02.880 --> 20:03.835
Doctor.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.113
I just wanna thank you
for letting me stay here.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.675
Expressing gratitude
is an Earth custom.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.590
-T'Pol says "thank you" all the time.
-I've noticed.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.074
T'Pol's lucky.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.278
It's nice to have a place to go home to.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.911
I know that you're romantically involved
with my daughter.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.591
There's no logic in denying it.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.795
How long have you
been attracted to her?

20:58.640 --> 21:02.679
I knew we had some kind of chemistry
the first time we got into an argument.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.794
I never had fun arguing
with anyone before.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.956
I got the impression
T'Pol wasn't gonna say anything to you.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.597
She didn't. I'm her mother.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.989
You've repaired it?

21:32.120 --> 21:36.079
The field generator just needed
a little adjustment. As good as new.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.873
If you have the time, perhaps
you could repair my food synthesiser.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.114
Would you mind?

21:53.640 --> 21:54.629
Koss?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.718
I need to speak with T'Pol.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.033
I wanna hear
about your life aboard the human ship.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.629
You must have
many fascinating stories.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.719
Why are you here?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.511
The answer should be obvious.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.270
You've received my letters. You know
I'm not interested in marriage.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.277
The decision isn't ours alone.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.312
My parents believe in the old traditions.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.398
For them,
a betrothal cannot simply be dismissed.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.274
You have the option
of choosing another mate.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.072
I don't want another mate.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.994
You should be aware
I've been ill recently.

22:46.000 --> 22:46.955
Ill?

22:48.040 --> 22:52.750
It could take some time for me
to recover, assuming it's even possible.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.829
I can help.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.519
My father's a man of influence. He
knows the finest doctors in the province.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.598
I intend to go through with this.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.756
What if I declared the kal-if-fee?

23:06.240 --> 23:07.753
Is that what you want?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.439
A fight to the death?

23:11.760 --> 23:14.433
Perhaps your human friend would make
a suitable challenger.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.028
-You find this amusing?
-No.

23:19.640 --> 23:24.077
Call a challenger if you wish.
I'll do whatever is necessary.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.232
It's best if you leave.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.676
I may be able to help your mother.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.951
-What do you mean?
-My father could have her reinstated.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.115
She retired.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.432
She was asked to resign.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.109
Why?

23:53.880 --> 23:55.711
I've said more than I should.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.193
If we were to marry...

24:04.080 --> 24:06.275
you'd only have to live on Vulcan
for one year.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.153
You could resume your career
with Starfleet after that.

24:09.280 --> 24:13.831
-ls that what you want, an absent wife?
-I'd want you to be happy.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.629
You should go.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.549
-How about that?
-What?

24:34.400 --> 24:36.197
Just to the left of Polaris.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.073
We found our first M-Class planet
around that star.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.872
Maybe humans will go back someday,
build a colony.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.755
I doubt it. The air was filled
with a psychotropic compound.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.714
After breathing it for a few hours, my
senior officers nearly killed each other.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.718
Maybe the Vulcans were right.
Maybe we weren't ready.

24:54.840 --> 24:58.196
Not ready?
How long were we supposed to wait?

24:58.840 --> 25:01.400
Look what it's gotten us.
We almost lost Earth.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.792
Enterprise saved Earth.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.596
If we weren't out there
stirring up trouble...

25:06.720 --> 25:09.154
seven million people might still be alive.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.439
You weren't "stirring up trouble,"
you were exploring.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.596
I'm not sure
there's much of a difference.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.438
So what do you suggest?

25:16.720 --> 25:18.950
-Put our starships in mothballs?
-No.

25:19.280 --> 25:23.432
We need them. But look at the Vulcans.
They're not explorers.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.917
They keep their ships close to home.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.156
You never know
who's gonna come calling.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.919
That's not the mission
either one of us signed up for.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.999
Maybe you'll feel differently after
you've delivered a few dozen eulogies.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.558
It's difficult to meditate
with you standing there.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.193
This retirement wasn't your choice.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.836
That's not entirely accurate. I chose
to retire rather than face dismissal.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.160
I was under investigation
by the Security Ministry.

26:11.280 --> 26:15.637
They claimed I had taken restricted data
from the Academy archives.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.278
-Did you?
-No.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.077
-I don't understand.
-Their accusations were fabricated.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.034
I was told that if I left the Academy,
they would end the inquiry.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.631
Why would the Ministry do this?

26:37.760 --> 26:38.875
Because of me.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.875
They blamed me
for the incident at P'Jem.

26:45.840 --> 26:49.469
After the monastery was destroyed,
the First Minister was dismissed.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.517
You've made many enemies here.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.597
They couldn't reach me on Enterprise,
so they punished you.

26:56.360 --> 27:00.239
It's criminal.
How could you let them do this?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.674
You've changed.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.874
Your emotions were always
close to the surface...

27:06.000 --> 27:08.036
but you managed to suppress them.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.753
It's because of this Commander Tucker,
isn't it?

27:13.360 --> 27:16.352
He's the reason
why you refuse to bond with Koss.

27:17.560 --> 27:21.917
Do you really believe that a human and
a Vulcan can have a future together?

27:22.600 --> 27:25.114
Imagine the shame
your children would endure.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.199
Assuming that the two of you
could have children.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.080
That wouldn't be your concern.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.309
You all right?

28:50.760 --> 28:53.479
I'm not even sure
what "all right" means anymore.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.433
Want to talk about it?

28:55.720 --> 28:57.756
There's an old code among climbers.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.916
Anything that happens on the mountain
stays there.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.076
You want to know why I'm out here?

29:03.480 --> 29:06.074
I figured this is the last place
I'd run into anyone...

29:06.200 --> 29:09.875
who'd wanna shake my hand,
take my picture, or tell me...

29:10.160 --> 29:12.355
I'm an inspiration to their children.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.477
If they knew what I'd done....

29:19.560 --> 29:21.790
You did what
any captain would've done.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.478
Does that include torture?

29:23.600 --> 29:25.352
Or marooning a ship
full of innocent people?

29:25.480 --> 29:28.916
Because I don't remember
reading those chapters in the handbook.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.598
Where are you going, Jon?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.232
You going climbing
in the middle of the night?

29:35.360 --> 29:36.349
Why not?

29:36.480 --> 29:39.870
It'd be a shame if you lost your footing.
It's a long way down.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.158
But at least you wouldn't have to deal
with these feelings anymore.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.271
Are you telling me
I have some kind of a death wish?

29:46.400 --> 29:47.469
You tell me.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.514
All I'm trying to do is get away from you.

29:58.280 --> 30:02.671
I look at you, and I see the person
I was three years ago...

30:03.160 --> 30:05.628
the explorer that my father
wanted me to be.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.238
I lost something out there.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.676
I don't know how to get it back.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.675
-What was that?
-Something I haven't done in a while.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.839
Whatever you lost...

30:36.760 --> 30:38.591
maybe I can help you find it.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.396
You know, if we have time
when we get back to Earth...

30:54.520 --> 30:57.398
I'd like to show you some sights,
return the favour.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.108
Everything okay?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.515
There's something I need to tell you.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.278
I've decided to marry Koss.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.269
Marry him?

31:17.400 --> 31:18.992
If I join his family...

31:20.640 --> 31:23.393
my mother will regain her position
at the Academy.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.636
His father is a senior Minister,
with a great deal of influence.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.553
I don't get it.
Are they forcing you to do this?

31:32.920 --> 31:34.433
The decision was mine.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.394
My mother resigned
because of my actions.

31:41.720 --> 31:45.110
You told me three years ago
you didn't even love this guy.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.997
So you're just gonna leave Starfleet
and move back to Vulcan?

31:50.120 --> 31:52.270
I've been negotiating with Koss' family.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.549
"Negotiating?"

31:54.920 --> 31:58.549
They've agreed
we won't have to reside together...

31:59.640 --> 32:00.868
not right away.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.070
I'll remain on Enterprise
for the time being.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.031
That's real generous of them.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.795
Trip, I have to do this for many reasons.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.350
And how am I supposed to take this?

32:18.040 --> 32:19.109
I'm sorry.

32:21.760 --> 32:22.909
You're sorry?

32:23.480 --> 32:26.358
You brought me 16 light-years
just to watch you get married...

32:26.480 --> 32:28.198
to someone you barely know.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.798
We should've brought a camera.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.309
You remember that planet
I told you about?

32:52.920 --> 32:55.275
There was a mountain range
on the southern continent.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.630
The view was almost as amazing
as this.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.479
That's a good day's climb
we've got ahead of us.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.718
We can reach the summit by nightfall,
but we should get moving.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.276
I think the view's fine from here.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.072
I'm glad you tagged along.

33:11.960 --> 33:16.670
You know, there's still something
I'm not quite clear about.

33:16.840 --> 33:17.955
What's that?

33:20.160 --> 33:22.196
Why did we stop seeing each other?

33:22.360 --> 33:26.638
Well, I was your superior officer.
It wasn't appropriate.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.511
You're not my superior anymore.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.676
I wonder if Starfleet would approve?

33:47.160 --> 33:49.754
The captains
of the only two warp 5 ships.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.075
You're forgetting the climbers' code.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.557
So, what's the verdict? Am I gonna live?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.920
Your parasite count is almost negligible.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.911
This should dispose of the rest of them.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.156
I hope you're gonna make it tonight.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.992
Madame Chang's.
Don't tell me that you forgot.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.471
My osmotic eel is under the weather.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.672
I should stay aboard
until she's feeling better.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.235
Wait. You've been talking
about the egg-drop soup at this place...

34:25.360 --> 34:26.588
for as long as I've known you.

34:26.719 --> 34:29.438
I'm sure you
and Ensign Mayweather will enjoy it.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.313
I spoke with Travis.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.554
What happened to you the other night?

34:38.239 --> 34:40.036
You must mean the....

34:41.000 --> 34:43.878
Nothing more than
an instinctive defensive response.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.870
So you're gonna stay aboard the ship
because of some loudmouth in a bar?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.594
My presence could provoke another
incident. Someone could get hurt.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.715
This isn't the way to deal with prejudice.

34:55.840 --> 34:59.276
The best thing is to show your face and
remind people that there are aliens...

34:59.400 --> 35:00.992
who don't wanna blow up the planet.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.839
I can't blame those men
for the way they reacted.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.155
Earth has survived a horrific attack.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.311
It will take time for the trauma to heal.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.159
Besides, I have friends
to keep me company.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.913
-Now, if it's not too much trouble....
-I'll bring you some take-out.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.352
The details of this debriefing
will remain classified...

35:31.480 --> 35:33.516
as ordered by the Command Council.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.435
If there are no further questions....

35:53.760 --> 35:54.829
Ambassador.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.271
I want to apologise
for what I said to you the other day.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.470
-I was out of line.
-Yes, you were.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.314
I'm glad we can finally agree
on something.

36:08.720 --> 36:09.709
Captain.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.069
Your actions...

36:12.200 --> 36:16.113
while being morally questionable,
were necessary.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.874
I opposed your appointment
as captain of Enterprise...

36:22.000 --> 36:24.230
but it's obvious now that I was wrong.

36:24.680 --> 36:28.639
T'Pol has told me that the Expanse
would have someday encompassed...

36:28.760 --> 36:31.149
hundreds of systems, including Vulcan.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.398
You've done a great service
for both our worlds.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.555
Thank you.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.029
Come in.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.949
-Koss and his family are waiting.
-I'll be there as soon as I can.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.553
Know any good tailors?

37:04.760 --> 37:07.479
These clothes belonged to my husband.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.913
They fit you well.

37:15.120 --> 37:19.079
Aren't you bothered by the fact that
T'Pol doesn't even care for this guy?

37:19.520 --> 37:21.795
She's fulfilling her family obligation.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.799
I met my husband only once
before we were joined.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.598
In time, we developed
a deep connection to each other.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.709
Yeah.

37:34.400 --> 37:38.109
Well, maybe she'd rather
make a connection with someone else.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.078
-Have you informed T'Pol?
-lnformed her of what?

37:42.200 --> 37:43.792
You're in love with her.

37:45.920 --> 37:49.629
Vulcans may not express their
emotions, but we are sensitive to them.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.829
I don't think I knew it until we were
standing over that lava field...

37:56.960 --> 37:59.315
and she told me
she was gonna marry Koss.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.714
That's when it hit me.
I was gonna lose her.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.955
I wanted to tell her right there but...

38:10.200 --> 38:11.269
I couldn't.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.999
There's still time.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.951
I thought you didn't approve.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.111
I may not condone your relationship...

38:30.240 --> 38:32.959
but it's important
for her to have all the facts.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.593
If I say anything,
T'Pol might call off the wedding.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.950
Or worse, not call it off.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.555
She's got enough pressure on her
as it is.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.274
I don't wanna make things
any more complicated.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.359
You look amazing.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.877
-I'm grateful that you're here.
-Wouldn't miss it for the world.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.315
It's time.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.591
What ye are about to witness...

39:54.320 --> 39:58.552
comes down from the time
of the beginning without change.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.996
This is the Vulcan heart.
This is the Vulcan soul.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.875
This is our way.
