00:24.149 --> 00:25.233

00:26.317 --> 00:27.444
They?

00:27.652 --> 00:29.154
It's how he make sense of it.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.364
It's not him actually moving it,

00:31.448 --> 00:33.992
it's the things doing it themselves.

00:35.493 --> 00:36.911
Hey, do you want some hot chocolate?

00:38.371 --> 00:43.793
So, you're telling me that Kylo Ren
wouldn't want to take out Luke's X-wing

00:43.877 --> 00:45.420
right here, right now?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.839
Because, I mean, if I were Kylo Ren,

00:48.089 --> 00:54.179
I would wait just beyond
X-wing tracking capabilities,

00:54.262 --> 00:56.848
and then when Luke finally decided
to patrol the galaxy,

00:56.931 --> 00:59.392
I'd shoot up and face him
and he'd have no choice. Dogfight!

00:59.476 --> 01:02.187
[makes space battle noises]

01:02.270 --> 01:04.522
Oh! Luke's in trouble. He needs help.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.107
Aah! They're on my tail!

01:06.191 --> 01:08.443
They're locked in! I can't shake 'em!
Ah! Help!

01:28.463 --> 01:29.297
Pew!

01:29.380 --> 01:30.507
Zoom!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.426
Oh! Are you kidding me?

01:33.676 --> 01:35.970
He just started doing all of this
on his own a few days ago?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.306
Huh!

01:38.556 --> 01:40.266
Come on. This is so cool.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.351
Pew!

01:43.186 --> 01:45.271
[Dion making space battle noises]

01:45.355 --> 01:46.940
[Pat] Okay. All right. Whoa!

01:53.822 --> 01:55.281
Agh. Agh.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[toys clattering]

02:01.246 --> 02:02.247
Agh!

02:04.916 --> 02:06.334
[Dion] I messed it up.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.838
Dude, that was amazing!

02:09.921 --> 02:11.422
I made them crash.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.968
You know what?
Superheroes crash stuff all the time.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.138
It happens, you know?
It's all in a day's work.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.223
I call myself Mind Mover
because I can move things--

02:20.306 --> 02:21.683
With your mind.

02:22.016 --> 02:25.562
That's very clever. I like it. Mind Mover.
I don't think it's been used yet.

02:25.645 --> 02:30.733
Maybe we should just slow down
with all the superhero talk, okay?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.611
These powers almost got him hit by a car.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.073
We should figure out
how to get it under control

02:37.157 --> 02:39.450
before we start thinking
about putting on a cape.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.202
Well, most superheroes don't wear capes.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.205
Not your point.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.832
Uh, the-- the thing is,

02:45.915 --> 02:47.333
it's not his fault.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.044
You're just gonna have to have
some years of training

02:50.128 --> 02:51.713
under a serious mentor.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.631
I want Pat to be my mentor.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.717
Really?

02:57.051 --> 02:58.469
I'm gonna cry. [laughs]

02:58.553 --> 03:03.850
Yes! He knows all about superheroes,
comic books, science fiction--

03:03.933 --> 03:05.560
And actual science.

03:05.643 --> 03:06.644
[chuckles]

03:06.978 --> 03:08.980
When I asked you for help,
this isn't what I meant.

03:09.647 --> 03:10.648
[inhales]

03:10.732 --> 03:14.068
I know, and I-- I--
I really heard every word.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.114
But... every superhero needs a team.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.492
-Superteam!
-Superteam!

03:22.660 --> 03:24.787
Let me be part of your superteam, Nicole.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.707
I've never been part of a superteam.

03:28.917 --> 03:29.751
[Pat chuckles]

03:30.793 --> 03:31.753
Fine.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.796
-Yes!
-High five!

03:35.381 --> 03:36.591
[Pat] Superteam!

03:41.554 --> 03:43.389
[voices whispering indistinctly]

03:58.029 --> 03:58.947
Are you okay?

04:00.823 --> 04:01.991
Are you feeling better?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.244
I'm glad Pat knows.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.453
Yeah, me too.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.248
Hey, get some sleep,

04:08.331 --> 04:11.918
and tomorrow we will get your little
superhero situation under control.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.628
Okay.

04:14.837 --> 04:15.713
Wait!

04:16.172 --> 04:17.173
Bedtime move.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.803
Silly me.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.186
[Nicole chuckles]

04:31.521 --> 04:33.356
[Dion] When can I go back to school?

04:34.607 --> 04:36.567
When we can make sure
that you won't hurt yourself.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.778
Or somebody else.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.238
Promise?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.281
[Nicole] I promise.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.086
Oh. I... Here, I...

04:55.670 --> 04:58.715
I've got it. You can just sit down, or...

04:59.132 --> 05:00.300
just relax.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.051
[Pat exhales]

05:02.385 --> 05:03.219
You okay?

05:03.845 --> 05:05.805
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-[crying]

05:08.182 --> 05:09.183
Hey, it's okay.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.811
He's... He's fine now. He...

05:12.770 --> 05:13.604
It's okay.

05:15.773 --> 05:16.649
You're all right.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.484
[Nicole clears throat]

05:19.360 --> 05:22.030
-Sorry.
-No, are you kidding? I mean...

05:23.031 --> 05:25.700
I'm still shaking
from seeing him in front of that car.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.872
And you've been dealing with this
all by yourself?

05:30.997 --> 05:31.831
[Pat sighs]

05:31.914 --> 05:33.958
You know, I was thinking,
I could, um...

05:34.042 --> 05:35.460
I could take him to BIONA.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.629
And just let him go nuts
in the storm simulator,

05:38.713 --> 05:40.757
and get some readings
on what he's able to do.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.218
No. He stays home until this settles down.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.804
-I-- I don't know what we're dealing with.
-Okay.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.639
It's like having a toddler all over again,

05:48.723 --> 05:52.310
but instead of wobbly legs, he...
he can crash a car just by looking at it.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.478
He did that?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.731
-No.
-No, of course not. Got it.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.066
Well...

05:58.775 --> 06:02.612
I mean, you've... you've power-proofed
this place pretty well.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.239
Well, I don't want him
to hurt himself, or...

06:05.865 --> 06:06.949
end up on YouTube.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.913
Yeah, no, you do not want
the black choppers swooping in.

06:11.996 --> 06:12.830
[chuckles]

06:13.956 --> 06:16.209
-Just kidding. That...
-No, but you weren't.

06:17.001 --> 06:21.839
Well, how long do you think
you can keep this up? Hiding him in here?

06:23.716 --> 06:26.844
He's already missed two days of school.
You know, I have to go back to work.

06:26.928 --> 06:31.015
And all he wants to do is just go
be around the other kids and be normal.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.101
Yeah. Well, he just...

06:34.602 --> 06:36.187
He just needs a little control.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.064
Maybe...

06:38.147 --> 06:38.981
Okay.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.776
Maybe if... if he can... if he can have,

06:41.859 --> 06:44.487
like, a tool
that will help focus his powers.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.864
You know, like, um,
Green Lantern has his ring?

06:47.532 --> 06:51.077
Or... Or Thor's got a hammer,
or like Cyclops' glasses.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.412
Those things aren't real.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.497
[stammers] But you don't need real.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.042
You're looking for a tool
to help him focus,

06:58.126 --> 07:00.837
so that his subconscious
does the work you want it to do.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.339
So you're telling me he should walk around
with a giant hammer?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.174
No, like a, you know...

07:05.258 --> 07:07.093
a magic feather. Whatever.

07:07.176 --> 07:10.346
[stammers] It doesn't matter what it is,
as long as Dion...

07:11.681 --> 07:12.515
believes in it.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.435
You got anything like that?

07:54.932 --> 07:56.392

08:06.569 --> 08:08.070
-[Nicole] Dion.
-Oh!

08:10.198 --> 08:11.991
It's okay, honey. Just pick up the box.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.203
Come here. I want to show you something.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.539
Am I in trouble?

08:18.998 --> 08:19.832
No.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.044
Actually, I think I got something
that you're gonna like.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.383
That's Dad's watch.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.343
[Nicole] Yeah.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.720
Do you want to hold it?

08:37.892 --> 08:38.726
It's heavy.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.103
Yeah, well,
it's a serious piece of equipment.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.524
Do you ever wonder why
Daddy took it with him on all his trips?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.400
This watch is very special.

08:46.901 --> 08:47.902
Special, how?

08:48.402 --> 08:49.612
It was designed

08:50.196 --> 08:52.240
so that the person wearing the watch

08:53.241 --> 08:54.283
would stay calm.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.246
So, when your dad was in the middle
of a really big storm...

08:59.872 --> 09:02.625
it would keep him
nice and calm and focused.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.335
Why didn't it save him?

09:05.211 --> 09:06.963
Well...

09:07.046 --> 09:08.506
he wasn't wearing it.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.052
One of the gauges was broken,
and, uh, he had to get it fixed.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.097
It would've protected him.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.557
[watch ticking]

09:18.099 --> 09:19.809
[Nicole] Now it can protect you.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.396
You wanna try it on?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.147
There you go.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.358
Oh, yeah.

are definitely more under control.

13:14.585 --> 13:18.547
Now, this is your opportunity
to get into the gifted program, okay?

13:19.215 --> 13:20.424
That's just more work, isn't it?

13:20.508 --> 13:21.592
It's more fun.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.844
Kids in the program,
they get to travel to conferences,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.263
take part in the robotics competition.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.099
My dad won that in eighth grade!

13:29.183 --> 13:31.185
[teacher] Are you interested
in robotics, Dion?

13:32.144 --> 13:33.771
Nice. Anyone else?

13:33.854 --> 13:35.397
-Me.
-Okay. Okay.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.398
-Me!
-Me!

13:36.482 --> 13:39.318
Jonathan? No? We're gonna need you, okay?

13:39.693 --> 13:41.445
You know what? Take a look at this.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.953
See, thousands of years ago,
people thought that red ball in the sky

13:49.036 --> 13:50.162
was a god of war...

13:51.121 --> 13:51.956
called Mars.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.668
Scientists taught us
that it was actually a planet.

13:55.751 --> 13:56.752
[girl] Wow.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.505
Then they sent up
a remote-controlled robot out into space.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.424
-Sweet.
-[teacher] Then we sent up another robot.

14:02.508 --> 14:06.512
See, at this very moment,
Mars is inhabited solely by robots.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.390
Now, I don't know about you guys,
but I think that we should get up there

14:09.473 --> 14:10.975
before those robots get any big ideas,

14:11.058 --> 14:11.892
-right?
-[laughter]

14:11.976 --> 14:12.810
Yeah.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.063
Now, I want you all to find something
you're really interested in learning,

14:16.146 --> 14:19.149
like defeating
our interplanetary robot overlords,

14:19.233 --> 14:20.734
and make that your project.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.112
Pick a problem. Solve it with...

14:23.195 --> 14:24.154
Science!

14:24.238 --> 14:25.197
Science.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.745
Uh, Mr. Fry?

14:31.829 --> 14:34.039
-Yeah.
-[Dion] I wasn't here yesterday.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.001
Ow!

14:37.084 --> 14:38.419
What are you doing?

14:38.627 --> 14:40.462
I picked you when you weren't here.

14:43.799 --> 14:44.633
What's that?

14:45.301 --> 14:46.385
My dad's watch.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.179
My dad uses a calculator,

14:49.263 --> 14:51.181
but this is way cooler.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.267
What do all the dials do?

14:53.684 --> 14:54.768
Science stuff.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.271
Should we use it for our project?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.565
It's just for me.

-Yeah.

-Let me show you a trick.
-You don't know magic.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.336
I learned a trick the other day.
Here, give me your watch. I'll show you.

This isn't funny. Give it back.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.880
It's my dad's watch. It's special.

Yeah.

It hurts.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.749
I don't know where you came from,
young man, but around here,

16:41.083 --> 16:44.461
we have a zero-tolerance policy
against violence.

16:45.045 --> 16:45.879
Let's go.

-I didn't touch him.
-Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

-I didn't touch him.
-Let's go, now.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.723
[Dion] But it's not fair!

16:56.515 --> 16:59.601
I'm trying to tell you, he took my watch
and he wouldn't give it back.

Hey, what's going on?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.732
-Do I know you?
-That's my son.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.650
Well, your son started a fight.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.610
-Dion?
-[Dion] I didn't!

17:09.069 --> 17:10.029
He took my watch.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.992
He's wearing my son's watch.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.412
He hit another student.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.831
Dion, did you hit this boy?

17:20.914 --> 17:22.708
And don't you even think
about lying to me.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.876
I didn't hit him.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.630
He said he didn't do it,
and this boy clearly took his watch,

17:28.714 --> 17:30.424
so why is my son the one in trouble?

17:30.507 --> 17:31.842
Because I don't believe him.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.969
I think a two-day suspension
would give him some time

17:34.053 --> 17:35.179
to think about what he's done.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.847
No, you can't suspend him.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.348
[scoffs] Yes, I can.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.685
I'm sorry. Look, he's a good kid, okay,
and he's new here.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.687
Is there just some way
we could talk this out?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.981
-Hey, can you help me out here?
-Yeah, what's going on?

17:48.108 --> 17:49.693
and this kid stole his watch,

17:49.777 --> 17:52.279
but for some reason, your colleague
doesn't seem to believe that.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.489
I have this under control.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.285
Jonathan, did you take the watch?

17:58.702 --> 17:59.703
For a magic trick.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.913
You didn't give it back.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.206
-It was a joke.
-Wait.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.791
Wait, did...

18:04.750 --> 18:05.584
did Dion hit you?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.095

18:20.474 --> 18:23.268
I think these boys would benefit
from mediation this time around.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.478
Of course you do.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.397
Look, you can talk all you want,

but this one's staying after school
for an hour today.

-Did you do something to him?
-I don't know.

He took my watch and I got mad, and...

19:14.153 --> 19:16.029
it happened before I knew it.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.031
Okay. Hey, look at me.

You can't hurt anyone, ever.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.161
Okay?

19:23.328 --> 19:25.289
Particularly with what you can do.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.461
Why didn't Mr. Campbell believe me?

He assumed you were a bad kid.

[Kat] <i>What?</i>

20:34.566 --> 20:35.442
<i>Why?</i>

He said Dion tried to start a fight
with this... skater kid.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.493

why you put him in that school.

<i>You're throwing him to the wolves.</i>

He's at a new school, he's...

21:27.369 --> 21:30.455
he's got no friends,
and he just lost his dad.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.625
I'm supposed to tell him
that the world's gonna slap him down

22:13.832 --> 22:16.335
Now, you both are good kids,

22:17.461 --> 22:19.588

22:20.922 --> 22:23.050
And you need to talk it out
if you get mad.

If you understand what the other person
is going through, you...

22:26.219 --> 22:28.096

Your dad wins things.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.538

22:53.997 --> 22:55.665
Well, how about
you shut up about it, okay?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.126
I don't mind if you talk about your dad.

suspending kids that young.

And he is not on my radar, okay?

23:25.987 --> 23:27.322
I do not have time for that.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.324
Maybe that's why
your face looks like that.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.711
-How do I find you?
-[Charlotte] <i>I'll find you.</i>

24:22.794 --> 24:24.129
-[call disconnects]
-Hello?

24:27.424 --> 24:29.551

[goat bleats]

24:42.355 --> 24:43.940
Uh... Suzanne.

24:44.024 --> 24:44.858
[goat bleats]

24:44.941 --> 24:48.695
I was just wondering
if you'd reconsidered my proposal.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.031
Not since the last time you asked.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.407
[goat bleats]

24:52.491 --> 24:55.285
Okay. You need to let me
look at Mark's work.

24:55.368 --> 24:58.747
I understand what he was doing
better than anyone else.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.877
[stammers] Is this part of Mark's project?

25:03.960 --> 25:05.504
Should I add something to the proposal?

25:05.587 --> 25:08.465
Pat, it's not that your proposal
wasn't good.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.383
Oh. Okay.

25:10.717 --> 25:13.261
But you're an engineer, not a scientist,

25:13.637 --> 25:15.597
and this lab is for scientific research.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.307
Well, maybe you could...

25:18.391 --> 25:19.893
bend the rules. [chuckles]

25:19.976 --> 25:22.437
Once. Just for...

25:22.521 --> 25:23.480
[goat bleats]

25:23.772 --> 25:24.898
...fun. Okay.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.067
Uh, all right. Well, thank you.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.569
Thank you for reading it
in the first place.

25:34.950 --> 25:35.784

[line trilling]

25:38.537 --> 25:40.580
Hey.<i> </i>You okay?

25:40.664 --> 25:43.208
[Nicole] <i>Um, listen, did you mean</i>
<i>what you said earlier</i>

25:43.291 --> 25:45.877
<i>-about helping with Dion?</i>
-Of course, whatever you need.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.297
Could you pick him up
from school today?<i> </i>Um...

25:50.215 --> 25:53.343
<i>Uh, he has to stay back</i>
<i>for, like, an hour. Um...</i>

25:53.677 --> 25:54.678
<i>There was an incident.</i>

25:55.720 --> 25:56.555
What happened?

25:56.638 --> 25:59.057
[Nicole sighs]
<i>I'll tell you about it, but, um...</i>

25:59.933 --> 26:00.767
Can you do it?

26:01.142 --> 26:05.230
Because I would ask Kat, you know,
but she... she's on call again tonight.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.440
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I can...

26:07.524 --> 26:08.984
[Nicole] <i>Amazing. Okay, awesome.</i>

26:09.067 --> 26:11.403
<i>I'm gonna send you over</i>
<i>the authorization form.</i>

26:14.155 --> 26:16.992
So, you get a... a...
another job interview or something?

26:17.325 --> 26:18.159
[Nicole] <i>Um...</i>

26:18.243 --> 26:20.078
Something like that, yeah. Um...

26:20.453 --> 26:22.914
But, hey, thank you, okay? Um...

26:22.998 --> 26:24.374
<i>I-- I shouldn't be too late.</i>

26:24.457 --> 26:26.251
Well, take your time. I'll, uh...

26:26.918 --> 26:30.046
I'll handle Dion
like a real superhero mentor. [chuckles]

26:30.130 --> 26:33.091
[Nicole] <i>I'm actually kind of enjoying</i>
<i>this superteam stuff.</i>

26:34.884 --> 26:35.927
<i>-Thanks.</i>

[children laughing]

[cell phone rings]

27:07.125 --> 27:07.959
Hi.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.670
[Charlotte] <i>We can't talk here.</i>
<i>There's too many people.</i>

27:11.046 --> 27:13.590
[sighs] <i>Head back</i>
<i>behind that stone building.</i>

27:14.424 --> 27:15.508
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

27:16.384 --> 27:18.136
Okay, how do I know
you're even really here?

27:18.219 --> 27:19.971
[Charlotte] <i>I'm close enough to see you.</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:23.475
<i>And if I'm being honest,</i>
<i>those pants are a little tight.</i>

27:24.684 --> 27:27.729
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>
<i>I can't stick around all day.</i>

27:28.396 --> 27:29.606
[stammers] Uh, okay.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.277
Okay, there's no one else around.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.987
[Charlotte] <i>Tell me why you really called.</i>

27:36.071 --> 27:38.573
I want to know why Mark
was going to see you in New Orleans.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.159
[Charlotte] <i>He was researching something</i>
<i>that went on in Iceland.</i>

27:41.242 --> 27:42.744
<i>He wanted to know what I knew.</i>

27:43.578 --> 27:45.747
-You were in Iceland, too?
-[Charlotte] <i>Yes.</i>

27:47.165 --> 27:49.167
-So, you're a scientist.
-[Charlotte] <i>No.</i>

27:49.876 --> 27:52.921
Then what could Mark find out from you
that he couldn't figure out on his own?

27:53.004 --> 27:56.091
[Charlotte] <i>If you're worried I was having</i>
<i>an affair with your husband, I wasn't.</i>

27:56.174 --> 27:58.301
Okay, well, thanks for that.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.303
But you were the last person
to see him alive.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.889
[echoing] <i>That's why you're standing</i>
<i>in the middle of the woods by yourself</i>

28:02.972 --> 28:04.099

28:07.435 --> 28:10.063
-[Charlotte] <i>Tell me what you really want.</i>
-Where are you?

28:10.146 --> 28:11.981
[Charlotte] <i>Three seconds,</i>
<i>and I'm leaving.</i>

28:13.024 --> 28:13.858
<i>One.</i>

28:14.693 --> 28:16.403
<i>-Two.</i>
-[stammers] Okay, okay. Um...

28:17.195 --> 28:18.988
[stammers] It's about my son, Dion.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.783
He's going through something.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.035
[Charlotte] <i>Physical?</i>

28:24.119 --> 28:24.953
Yes.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.038
Yes, I...

28:27.580 --> 28:31.876
I don't know how to explain it.
He can do things that aren't possible.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.965
And I know it sounds like I'm crazy,
but I promise you that I am not crazy.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.552
Unless, of course, I am crazy.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.137
You're not crazy.

28:55.150 --> 28:55.984
You're still here.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.612
With my dad's job, it's like
I'm in detention every afternoon.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.572
[sucks in breath]

29:01.865 --> 29:04.325
It's not right that you got punished
and Jonathan didn't.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.535
You didn't even touch him.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.704
Wait, you saw that?

29:07.787 --> 29:10.165
Jonathan face-planting? It was epic.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.543
Uh-oh. Don't look now.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.383
Hey.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.594
Nice sucker punch, jerk.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.305
-Let's go before his mom gets here.
-[chuckles]

29:25.388 --> 29:27.056
[vehicle approaches]

29:30.351 --> 29:31.519
I like your mom.

[car door closes]

29:33.396 --> 29:34.230
Hey, buddy.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.524
Pat!

29:37.776 --> 29:39.152
[Pat grunts] Oh!

29:39.235 --> 29:42.197
-How was your time inside? [chuckles]
-[Dion] I don't want to talk about it.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.782
You call your dad "Pat"?

29:43.865 --> 29:45.408
He's not my dad, he's...

29:46.826 --> 29:47.660
my mentor.

29:48.661 --> 29:49.496
I'm his mentor.

29:50.830 --> 29:51.998
Ready to go? All right.

29:52.916 --> 29:53.750
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:53.833 --> 29:54.876
Bye.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.377
[Dion] Bye.

29:57.712 --> 29:59.964
So what's with you
getting held after school?

30:00.298 --> 30:01.800
I don't want to talk about it.

30:02.091 --> 30:02.967
[dog barks]

30:03.468 --> 30:04.302
Hey.

30:05.386 --> 30:06.846
Is that your dad's old watch?

30:07.597 --> 30:09.432
Helps with my powers. Keeps me focused.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.520
Do you like it? It's a good watch.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.146
Mmm, yeah.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.273
Got me in trouble, though.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.067
How?

30:21.444 --> 30:22.904
Hey, hey, hey, Dion.

30:24.948 --> 30:25.824
No pressure,

30:26.699 --> 30:27.951
but if you ever want to talk,

30:28.034 --> 30:30.286
I'm here and I got your back, right?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.373
It's Mind Mover and his mentor.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.335
Your shirt's gonna have three M's on it.

30:37.418 --> 30:38.253
[laughs]

30:38.545 --> 30:40.588
Well, we can... we can work on the name.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.007
[Pat chuckles]

30:43.675 --> 30:44.801
What?

30:45.218 --> 30:46.052
[sighs]

30:46.135 --> 30:47.387
The kids at school hate me.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.139
Well...

30:51.099 --> 30:53.893
then I think we gotta find
some better kids, right?

30:55.979 --> 30:56.855
Let's go.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.399
-They hate me too.
-[Dion laughs]

30:59.482 --> 31:01.442
It's usually a good sign. True.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.570
-I guess.
-[Pat laughs]

31:05.655 --> 31:07.240
What's up, baby boy?

31:07.323 --> 31:08.408
[Dion] Hi, Tessa.

31:08.783 --> 31:09.617
[Pat chuckles]

31:10.243 --> 31:13.413
-You the one Nicole told me about?
-She... she told you about me?

31:13.496 --> 31:14.539
[both laugh]

31:15.039 --> 31:16.457
Pat, right? [laughs]

31:16.541 --> 31:18.376
Yes, I am "the Pat."

31:18.459 --> 31:19.627
[both laugh]

31:20.378 --> 31:23.715
Malik. You know you don't just
walk past people without saying hello.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.633
[Pat] Oh. That's all right. I...

31:26.217 --> 31:27.051
What up?

31:27.135 --> 31:28.887
-Hey, I'm... I'm Pat.
-Yeah.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.638
-[Pat] Oh.
-[Malik's friends laugh]

31:30.722 --> 31:32.765
-I'm sorry, I...
-Boy, act right.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.101
[sighs]

31:35.894 --> 31:37.645
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey, nice to meet you too.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.856
-What's good, little man?
-Where you guys going?

31:40.231 --> 31:42.692
I'm about to go dunk on these fools
real quick. [chuckles]

31:42.775 --> 31:44.903
-Hey, you should go with them.
-Nah.

31:45.528 --> 31:47.322
Nah, old head's right.
You should come with us.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.449
You know, show us your skills.
Come on, let's go.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.200
Yeah. Come on.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.453
-We got nothing else going on.
-[Malik] Come on.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.997
Come on. Old head's right.

31:57.874 --> 32:01.461
-I'm not good at basketball.
-Yeah, but I'm the absolute worst.

32:01.544 --> 32:02.587
So let's go.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.672
-Come on.
-[Dion sighs]

32:04.756 --> 32:05.590
[Pat laughs]

32:07.050 --> 32:08.718
[birds chirping]

32:08.801 --> 32:10.470
I was married 15 years,

32:10.553 --> 32:13.556
and when he left, I bought
a one-way ticket to Europe, and...

32:14.223 --> 32:17.185
I was planning to get lost.
That's when I found out about this...

32:17.268 --> 32:19.729
once-in-a-lifetime celestial thing
in Iceland.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.439
The aurora event.

32:22.565 --> 32:23.900
It's where it all started.

32:24.692 --> 32:25.526
[sighs]

32:26.194 --> 32:29.072
I was just gonna, you know,
go up and see the northern lights,

32:29.155 --> 32:31.991
maybe a comet would go by, and then....

32:34.619 --> 32:35.578
the sky...

32:37.163 --> 32:38.122
exploded.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.500
There were all these...

32:41.793 --> 32:42.961
colors. It was...

32:44.087 --> 32:46.047
the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

32:46.714 --> 32:49.509
And I had never felt better in my life.
It was like a...

32:51.177 --> 32:52.762
drug or something.

32:52.845 --> 32:53.680
Anyway...

32:54.180 --> 32:56.474
Afterwards, I... I went home. I...

32:57.141 --> 32:58.977
I slowly got back to my normal life,

32:59.060 --> 33:01.854
but I kept in touch
with a few of the people I met up there.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.107
It was years before the...

33:04.899 --> 33:06.192
weird stuff started.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.569
-Weird stuff?
-[sighs]

33:09.445 --> 33:10.571
Weird stuff like how?

33:11.531 --> 33:12.490
Weird like that.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.078
Only, at first, I couldn't control it.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.330
Even after I figured it out,

33:19.414 --> 33:21.666
it took me a year
to trace it back to Iceland.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.210
And how did you do that?

33:24.293 --> 33:26.421
The people that I met up there
changed too,

33:26.504 --> 33:29.257
and as soon as I figured that out,
Mark called.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.383
He knew something.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.177
And he wanted to talk.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.178
-But...
-[sighs]

33:34.679 --> 33:37.223
how could Mark know?

33:37.306 --> 33:39.559
Because it was happening to him, too.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.230
Mark...

33:45.648 --> 33:47.150
had powers?

33:47.233 --> 33:49.027
How do you think your son got them?

33:52.280 --> 33:53.823
[hip hop plays]

33:55.533 --> 33:57.201
-Let's go home.
-What are you talking about?

33:57.285 --> 34:00.621
-We're just getting going.
-I can't even get the ball up that high.

34:01.122 --> 34:01.956
Well...

34:02.623 --> 34:03.624
neither can I.

34:04.751 --> 34:08.337
Why don't you try
not shooting with your hands?

34:09.297 --> 34:11.007
-What are you talking about?
-You know.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.387
Mmm...

34:17.263 --> 34:19.891
[imitates ball swooshing,
landing in basket]

34:23.269 --> 34:24.479
Try moving it with your mind.

34:26.689 --> 34:27.774
Hey.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.442
Sit down for a second. Huddle.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.111
Take a knee.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.654
All right, so...

34:34.822 --> 34:37.909
First lesson of being a superhero
is learning to use your powers

34:37.992 --> 34:41.287
without revealing them to civilians.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.541
My mom told me
not to use my powers in public.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.127
That's why moms
don't get to be in comic books.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.672
But I mean, I wouldn't tell her,

34:52.173 --> 34:55.426
and I think she would be upset
if people saw you using your powers,
