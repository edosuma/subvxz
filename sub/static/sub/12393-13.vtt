00:09.410 --> 00:11.207
- THIS IS HUMILIATING, DAD.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.970
- WELL, NOT AS HUMILIATING
AS BEING THE PARENT

00:14.010 --> 00:18.470
OF THE ONLY CHILD SENT
HOME FROM HIS SCHOOL WITH LICE.

00:18.510 --> 00:20.717
- THAT SHAMPOO SMELLS
LIKE URINAL CAKES.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.116
- SMELLING LIKE A MEN'S ROOM
IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

00:23.150 --> 00:25.380

OF PARASITES.

00:25.420 --> 00:26.956

ANYWAYS?

00:28.090 --> 00:29.352

WITH ANYTHING

00:29.390 --> 00:31.085
OUT OF THE ORDINARY LATELY?

00:31.130 --> 00:33.155
- NO, UNLESS YOU COUNT
THAT SQUIRREL

00:33.200 --> 00:34.952
WITH THE FOAMY MOUTH
I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.059
- WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
THEY SENT YOU HOME.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.739
ALL IT TAKES
IS ONE UNCLEAN CHILD

00:39.770 --> 00:41.988
TO START
A FULL-BLOWN OUTBREAK.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.462
- WHAT'S AN OUTBREAK?

00:43.510 --> 00:46.877
- IT'S WHEN AN ILLNESS
IS PASSED FROM PERSON TO PERSON

00:46.910 --> 00:49.606
UNTIL IT BECOMES WIDESPREAD.

00:49.650 --> 00:50.947
- HOW'S IT PASSED?

00:50.980 --> 00:53.574
- WELL, ONE COULD COME IN
CONTACT WITH A SICK PERSON

00:53.620 --> 00:57.010
OR MAYBE EVEN SOMETHING
THEY'VE TOUCHED.

00:57.050 --> 01:01.009
- LIKE A COMB?
- EXACTLY, LIKE A COMB.

01:01.060 --> 01:04.450
WAIT.
WHY DID YOU SAY COMB?

01:04.490 --> 01:06.458
- BECAUSE I USED YOURS
THIS MORNING.

OH, MY GOD...

01:16.940 --> 01:18.430
DAMN IT.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.827

WHAT SMELLS WORSE,

01:41.860 --> 01:44.328
THAT BREAKFAST BURRITO
OR THOSE NACHO CHEESE CORNNUTS

01:44.370 --> 01:45.598
YOU USED TO EAT.

01:45.630 --> 01:48.064
- LET'S DO A SMELL TEST.
HERE, CLOSE YOUR EYES.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.965
- DUDE, I DEMAND TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.034
- WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

01:51.070 --> 01:52.298

EATING STINKY FOOD

01:52.340 --> 01:54.035
AND DRESSED LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO GO TAILGATING?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.775

01:55.810 --> 01:58.699
BECAUSE I CAN.
- OKAY, I GET IT.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.547
SO NOW THAT YOU'RE SINGLE,
YOU'RE DOING ALL THE THINGS

02:00.580 --> 02:02.286
ABIGAIL WOULDN'T LET YOU DO
WHILE YOU WERE DATING.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.787
- YOU NAILED IT.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.288
WHICH IS WHY I'M TIVOING
BLAME IT ON RIO AS WE SPEAK.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.413

02:26.910 --> 02:28.070

DOLLARS?

02:28.110 --> 02:29.179

LIKE A DATE?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.655

CALL IT THAT.

04:10.810 --> 04:13.244
I MEAN, I REALLY, REALLY
MESSED UP.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.709
- OH, GOOD.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

04:16.750 --> 04:17.739
- I DON'T.

BUT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT
IN MOVIES,

04:19.120 --> 04:21.281

ALMOST MAGICALLY.

I WORK FOR A COURIER SERVICE
THAT SPECIALIZES

04:25.160 --> 04:26.889
IN THE TRANSPORT
OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS.

04:26.930 --> 04:30.195
AND YESTERDAY I WAS TOLD TO
PICK UP A COOLER FROM A LAB

04:30.230 --> 04:33.529
CALLED GENUTECH, TAKE IT BACK
TO MY HOTEL BY THE AIRPORT,

04:33.570 --> 04:36.300
THEN FLY TO CDC HEADQUARTERS
IN ATLANTA THIS MORNING.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.433
BUT LIKE AN IDIOT,
I WENT OUT.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.835
AND WHEN I
WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

04:39.880 --> 04:40.869
THE COOLER WAS GONE.

04:40.910 --> 04:42.446
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
I DID WITH IT,

04:42.480 --> 04:45.608
BECAUSE I WAS SO DRUNK,
THE ENTIRE NIGHT'S A BLUR.

04:45.650 --> 04:48.369

- SHAWN.

WAS IN THE COOLER?

I WOULD HAVE NEVER GONE OUT

04:56.060 --> 04:59.120
HAD I KNOWN AT THE TIME
WHAT WAS INSIDE THE COOLER.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.593
- DON NY, WHAT WAS
IN THE COOLER?

05:00.630 --> 05:04.259
- UH, THE--
THE THORNBURG VIRUS.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.359
- THE THORNBURG VIRUS?

05:06.400 --> 05:07.662
- THORNBURG...

05:07.700 --> 05:09.031
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH
RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN?

05:09.070 --> 05:10.833
- THAT'S THE THORN BIRDS.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.974
THORNBURG IS AN EXTREMELY
RARE VIRUS

05:13.010 --> 05:14.432
THAT USUALLY TARGETS PEOPLE
IN AFRICA--

05:14.480 --> 05:15.970
WHICH MAKES IT RACIST,
BY THE WAY.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.648
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.772
YOU HIT THE TOWN.

05:18.810 --> 05:21.313
YOU GOT SLOPPY DRUNK.
PASSED OUT.

05:21.350 --> 05:23.989
WOKE UP WITHOUT A VIRUS?

05:24.020 --> 05:26.079
ISN'T IT USUALLY
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.054
- NORMALLY
I WOULD NOTIFY THE POLICE

05:28.090 --> 05:30.126
OR THE CDC
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.799
BUT I WAS JUST THINKING THAT
MAYBE IF WE FIND IT FIRST,

05:32.830 --> 05:35.628
THEN NO ONE
HAS TO BE THE WISER.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.799
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES
THE COOLER THAT'S MISSING?

05:37.830 --> 05:40.799
- YES, MY ANTIQUE GOLD WATCH
GIVEN TO ME BY MY FATHER.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.707

WERE TO OPEN THIS COOLER,

05:43.740 --> 05:44.809
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, EXACTLY?

05:44.840 --> 05:47.229
- UH, WELL,
UH, IF SOMEONE

05:47.280 --> 05:49.771
WENT SO FAR AS TO TOUCH
THE CONTENTS OF THE VIAL,

05:49.810 --> 05:51.971

NOT BE GOOD.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.773

08:25.800 --> 08:26.994
- TRUST ME, LASSIE,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.463
I'M GETTING
A VERY CLEAR SIGNAL ON THIS.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.105
- THORNBURG VIRUS.
THERE IS NO WAY.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.334
RIGHT, O'HARA?

08:33.380 --> 08:36.178
- STEP AWAY FROM THAT BODY.
THAT'S AN ORDER.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.609
- O'HARA!

08:37.650 --> 08:38.878
- I DON'T WANT TO TAKE
THE CHANCE THAT HE'S WRONG.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.071
I'M GONNA CALL THE CDC.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.778
- YOU WERE RIGHT TO RAISE
THE POSSIBILITY, SHAWN,

08:47.820 --> 08:52.598
EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT THAT
WASN'T THORNBURG THAT GOT HER.

08:52.630 --> 08:56.350
- I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA GET THAT LUCKY.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.007
- DONNY!

09:05.040 --> 09:09.841
- DOES THIS WOMAN
LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU?

09:09.880 --> 09:11.802
- UH, NO.

09:11.850 --> 09:12.942
IS SHE DEAD?

09:12.980 --> 09:14.277
- AS A BAG OF ROCKS.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.174
- IT'S DUMB
AS A BAG OF ROCKS, SHAWN.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.687
- GUESS WHAT SHE WAS WEARING
ON HER WRIST, DONNY?

09:17.720 --> 09:18.812
- DON'T KNOW.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.818
- YOUR WATCH.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.829
- 5-50 I KILLED HER?
OH, GOD.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.828
OH, GOD.
THE TEQUILA.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.259
IT TURNED ME INTO TED BUNDY.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.927
- NO, DONNY.
YOU'RE NOT TED BUNDY.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.359
YOU DIDN'T KILL HER.
NOT DIRECTLY.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.630
- THERE WAS BLOOD DRIPPING
FROM HER EYE.

09:32.670 --> 09:35.798
- SHE HAD THORNBURG?
- IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.102
IF SHE HAD YOUR WATCH, SHE MAY
ALSO HAVE HAD YOUR COOLER.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.779
- OH, GOD.
OH, GOD, NO!

09:39.810 --> 09:41.300
OH, NO, GOD!
OH, GOD--

09:41.340 --> 09:42.944
- DON NY, BREATHE.
STOP.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.278
BREATHE IN.
BREATHE OUT.

09:45.310 --> 09:48.313
IN, OUT.
HERE, CHEW THIS GUM.

09:48.350 --> 09:51.888
- MMM, IT'S DELICIOUS.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.319
- EXPLOSION OF FLAVOR, RIGHT?
- DELICIOUS.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.657
- YEAH.
NOW LISTEN.

09:54.690 --> 09:56.726
IF WE'RE GONNA
RETRIEVE YOUR COOLER,

09:56.760 --> 09:57.988
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THIS WOMAN IS.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.725
ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE?

09:59.760 --> 10:02.024
- I--I DON'T KNOW.
- CONCENTRATE, MAN!

10:02.060 --> 10:03.766
- YES, SIR.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.864
OH, WE WERE DRINKING TOGETHER
LAST NIGHT.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.162
- GREAT.
WHAT ELSE?

10:09.200 --> 10:12.806
- WE WERE EATING.
CHICKEN KATSU.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.104
- YUMMY, APRICOT SAUCE?
- SHAWN!

10:15.140 --> 10:16.209
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE YOU WERE?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.049
- NO.
NO, BUT--

10:18.080 --> 10:21.447
THE PLACE HAD A BUNCH OF--

10:21.480 --> 10:22.742
TIKI TORCHES!

10:25.320 --> 10:27.185
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS THE PLACE?

10:27.220 --> 10:28.710
- I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE,
DONNY.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.421
MY PSYCHIC SENSES
ARE NEVER OFF.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.189
- AND THIS IS THE BAR
IN YOUR HOTEL.

10:32.230 --> 10:34.790
- WHAT--OKAY,
I'M NEVER DRINKING AGAIN.

10:34.830 --> 10:35.899
- THERE HE IS.

10:35.930 --> 10:37.921
THERE'S THE GUY.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.063
- I HAVE SOMETHING OF YOURS.
- YOU DO?

10:40.100 --> 10:41.533
- YEAH, HERE IT IS.

10:41.570 --> 10:42.764
- NO, LEAVE IT!
- NO!

10:42.810 --> 10:45.108
- YOU REMEMBER WEARING
THIS THING?

10:45.140 --> 10:48.075
YOU WERE LIKE, "CHECK ME OUT.
I'M RAINBOW MAN."

10:48.110 --> 10:50.601
- YOU'RE A MADMAN.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.003
- HEY, LET ME BUY YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS A DRINK.

10:52.050 --> 10:55.110
- I'LL HAVE A CLUB SODA
WITH THREE PINEAPPLE WEDGES.

10:55.150 --> 10:57.584
AND IF YOU CAN GET
THE HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE GOING,

10:57.620 --> 10:59.781
FLIP A FEW GLASSES AND
INTRODUCE ME TO ELIZABETH SHUE,

10:59.820 --> 11:02.254
THERE'S AN EXTRA FIVER
IN IT FOR YOU.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.178
- WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE
TO HELP RAINBOW MAN

11:04.230 --> 11:05.686
FILL IN THE BLANKS
FROM LAST NIGHT.

11:05.730 --> 11:07.152
HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME
REMEMBERING.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.758
- I'LL BET.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.564
HE AND THIS SMOKIN' BRUNETTE
MUST'VE HAD 20 TEQUILA SHOTS.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.760
- YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO REMEMBER

11:12.800 --> 11:14.165
THE SMOKING BRUNETTE'S NAME,
WOULD YOU?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.792
- I BELIEVE HER NAME
WAS GINGER.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.034
- GINGER.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.765
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WENT
BY CHANCE?

11:18.810 --> 11:21.779
- DON'T WORRY.
I DO.

11:25.050 --> 11:28.542
- WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THIS IS CRAZY.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.616
SO I TOOK HER
BACK TO MY ROOM?

11:30.650 --> 11:33.915
I NEVER DO THAT.
IS IT POSSIBLE I HAVE GAME?

11:36.090 --> 11:38.058
- APPARENTLY
YOU DID LAST NIGHT.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.682
SHE WAS QUITE TAKEN WITH YOU.

11:39.730 --> 11:41.755
- REALLY?
- NO, SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.166
- OH, COME ON.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.361
- THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU MET HER IN A HOTEL BAR.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.958
- PLUS, HER NAME IS GINGER,
DONNY.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.558
THROUGHOUT HISTORY
THERE'S ONLY TWO GINGERS

11:49.600 --> 11:50.999
THAT WEREN'T PROSTITUTES:

11:51.040 --> 11:53.099
GINGER ROGERS AND GINGER
FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.937
AND I STILL HAVE MY SUSPICIONS
ABOUT THE LATTER.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.971
IN FACT, GUS,
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.307
SHE WAS
A FILTHY PIRATE HOOKER.

11:58.350 --> 11:59.442
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.574
- YEAH, WELL,
AT LEAST I SCORED, RIGHT?

12:04.790 --> 12:07.782
- DONNY, YOUR FRIEND GINGER
TARGETED YOU, OKAY?

12:07.820 --> 12:10.220
THAT MEANS HER PLAN WAS
TO GET YOU SLOPPY DRUNK,

12:10.260 --> 12:11.557
WAIT TILL YOU PASS OUT,

12:11.590 --> 12:12.727
AND ROB YOU BLIND.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.251
- YEAH, BUT WHY WOULD SHE
TAKE THE COOLER?

12:15.300 --> 12:17.461
- MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT
CONTAINED SOMETHING VALUABLE.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.334
- THE STUFF I TRANSFER
IS REALLY VALUABLE.

12:21.370 --> 12:23.964
THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.068
[cell phone playing
Rump Shaker]

12:25.110 --> 12:26.463
- OH, THAT'S ME.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.035
- I CANNOT WAIT TILL YOU
FIND A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.069
- JULES?

12:30.110 --> 12:31.873
- SHAWN, YOU WERE
TOTALLY RIGHT.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.719
- ABOUT WHAT, ATLANTIS?
- NO, NO!

12:33.750 --> 12:35.513
ABOUT THE GIRL.
SHE HAD THORNBURG.

12:35.550 --> 12:37.245
WE CAN'T BE 100% SURE,
I MEAN,

12:37.290 --> 12:39.144
BUT ALL OF HER SYMPTOMS
ARE CONSISTENT.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.179
CDC'S ON IT'S WAY.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.517
OH, AND HER NAME
WAS JENNIFER COTSITAS.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.925
- LET ME GUESS.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.281
SHE'S A PROSTITUTE
WHO WENT BY THE NAME "GINGER."

12:45.330 --> 12:46.729
- WOW, YOU NAILED IT.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.557
- YEAH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:48.600 --> 12:49.965
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I
GET THIS GIRL'S ADDRESS.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.661
I NEED TO--I NEED TO GO
BY THERE.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.339
- UH, THAT'S WHERE
I'M CALLING YOU FROM.

12:54.370 --> 12:55.530
AND SHAWN, SHE MUST BE
A GREAT HOOKER.

12:55.570 --> 12:56.639
THIS PLACE IS SWEET.

12:56.670 --> 12:58.638
- YOU KIDDING?
LISTEN TO ME, JULES.

12:58.670 --> 13:01.468
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING
THAT EVEN RESEMBLES A COOLER,

13:01.510 --> 13:03.068
DON'T GO NEAR IT,
OKAY?

13:03.110 --> 13:04.179
- NO, DON'T WORRY.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.746
WE HAVE COMBED THIS PLACE
HEAD TO TOE

13:05.780 --> 13:07.509
AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
LIKE THAT HERE.

13:07.550 --> 13:08.949
OH, BUT GET THIS,
IN ONE OF HER DRAWERS,

13:08.980 --> 13:11.983
WE FOUND $10,000 IN CASH
IN A FRESH ENVELOPE.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.453
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

13:13.490 --> 13:15.754
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE
MISSING TEN GRAND, WOULD YOU?

13:15.790 --> 13:16.950
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:16.990 --> 13:18.582
I CAN'T BE MISSING SOMETHING
I NEVER HAD.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.495
- GUS...

13:20.530 --> 13:23.067
SOMEBODY HIRED HER
TO STEAL THE COOLER.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.466
I'M BACK.
- OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.060
IN THAT ENVELOPE, WE FOUND ONE
OF THOSE OLD SCHOOL HOTEL KEYS

13:28.100 --> 13:31.831
TO THE EL CAPITAN.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.838
- LET ME GUESS.
ROOM 106?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.678
- NO, BUT THAT'S REALLY CLOSE.
IT'S ROOM 128.

13:36.710 --> 13:39.440
- 128?

13:41.380 --> 13:42.847
OH, HEY, HEY, EXCUSE ME.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.687
UH, WE JUST
CHECKED INTO THIS ROOM.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.483
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
COME BACK A LITTLE BIT LATER?

13:46.520 --> 13:47.612
- BUT IT'S NOT CLEAN.
- THAT'S OKAY.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.355
NEITHER ARE WE.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.584
- THANK YOU.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.696
- GUS,

13:56.730 --> 13:59.198
CHECK THIS OUT.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.993
- THAT'S WEIRD.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.031
LET ME CALL THE FRONT DESK.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.537
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:04.570 --> 14:06.629
- DONNY, WHOEVER
RENTED THIS ROOM

14:06.670 --> 14:09.537
PAID OUR FRIEND GINGER
TO STEAL THE COOLER FROM YOU.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.048
HE GAVE HER A KEY, HE WAITED
FOR HER TO MAKE THE DROP,

14:12.080 --> 14:13.672
AND I'M GUESSING CURIOSITY
GOT THE BEST OF HER

14:13.720 --> 14:14.971
AND SHE OPENED IT UP
BEFORE HANDING IT OVER.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.012
- BUT WHY WOULD SOMEONE
WANT TO BUY THE VIRUS?

14:18.050 --> 14:19.278
- I HAVE A GUESS.

14:19.320 --> 14:22.187
AND MUCH LIKE THIS BEDSPREAD,
IT'S NOT PRETTY.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.029
- THIS ROOM WAS PAID FOR
IN CASH

14:24.060 --> 14:26.358
AND REGISTERED
TO A VAL KILMER.

14:26.390 --> 14:29.052
- IT'S EITHER AN ALIAS
OR VAL HAS OFFICIALLY LOST IT.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.829
- SO WHAT NOW?

14:35.240 --> 14:36.832
- I COULD GO FOR SOME JOE.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.428
- THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.

14:38.470 --> 14:39.801
WE'RE RUSHING TO CHECK OUT
SOME COFFEE PLACE

14:39.840 --> 14:42.377
THAT SOME MYSTERIOUS PERSON
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT

14:42.410 --> 14:43.502
BE CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS

14:43.550 --> 14:44.972
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE VISITED.

14:45.010 --> 14:48.571
- WELL, I FOR ONE, TRUST MR.
SPENCER'S INSTINCTS ON THIS.

14:48.620 --> 14:49.917
- WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

14:49.950 --> 14:51.042
- CARLTON, WE NEED TO LOOK
INTO EVERY POSSIBLE LEAD

14:51.090 --> 14:52.239
AT THIS POINT.

14:52.290 --> 14:55.316
BESIDES, YOU WERE ALREADY WRONG
ONCE TODAY.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.453
- I'VE NEVER SEEN LASSIE
PUT IN HIS PLACE LIKE THAT.

14:57.490 --> 14:58.559
- IT'S HOT.

14:58.590 --> 14:59.818
I'D LIKE HER
TO PUT ME IN MY PLACE.

14:59.860 --> 15:01.225
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE, SHAWN.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.523
- WHOA.

15:06.570 --> 15:11.462
- WHAT?

15:11.510 --> 15:16.277
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

15:16.310 --> 15:19.541
- HEY.
- SORRY, MAN.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.911
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET
A BISCOTTI.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.372
YOU COULD BE IN THERE
FOR A WHILE.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.988
- CDC IS PRETTY MUCH
DONE IN THERE.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.159
EVERYONE FROM THE CAFE HAS BEEN
MOVED TO QUARANTINE

15:31.190 --> 15:32.589
AT SANTA BARBARA GENERAL.

15:32.630 --> 15:35.224
- WHY DON'T YOU WIPE THAT SMILE
OFF YOUR FACE, MCNAB?

15:35.260 --> 15:37.069
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

15:37.100 --> 15:38.226
I DIDN'T EVEN GO INSIDE
THE CAFE.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.669
- OH, IT'S NECESSARY.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.897
YEAH, THE CDC DOESN'T WANT
TO TAKE ANY CHANCES, SO...

15:42.940 --> 15:45.761
- FOR THE LAST TIME,
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

15:45.810 --> 15:47.129
- HI, I'M DONNY LIEBERMAN.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.307
HEY, I'M THE GUY WHO, UH,
SCREWED ALL THIS UP.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.739
- I'M NOT BIG
ON NUDE HANDSHAKES.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.042
- OKAY.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.843
- THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST BEING SAFE, CARLTON.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.108
OOH, THAT TICKLES.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.948
- SPENCER, ARE YOU
SHAMPOOING YOUR HAIR?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.639
- YES, I AM, LASSIE.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.248
I ALWAYS TRAVEL
WITH A SMALL PACKET

16:01.290 --> 16:03.781
OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S
BABY SHAMPOO IN MY WALLET.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.024
- BABY SHAMPOO?

16:05.060 --> 16:07.949
- NO MORE TEARS, JULES.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.059
- WHOA!
TAKE IT EASY, SLUGGER.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.124
WHAT, ARE WE DATING?

16:11.170 --> 16:12.296
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, SHAWN.

16:12.330 --> 16:13.763
FIRST, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A PROSTITUTE.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.028
NOW, I'M NAKED
IN A PARKING LOT.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.264
- IT'S JUST LIKE
OUR PROM NIGHT.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.961
- SHAWN?
- GUS, RELAX.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.932
DON'T BE NIC CAGE'S ACCENT
FROM CON AIR.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.335
WE'VE BATHED TOGETHER BEFORE.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.677
- WHEN WE WERE THREE.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.246
- IT'S ESSENTIALLY
THE SAME THING.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.804
IT'S JUST IMPOLITE TO PEE.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.273
THAT FEELS GREAT, BY THE WAY.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.818
DO YOU HAVE ANY ALOE?

16:34.290 --> 16:36.315
- DUDE, I'M FREEZING.
GIVE ME YOUR DAMN SWEATSHIRT.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.521
- [mock whining]
FINE.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.323
YOU'RE LUCKY I HAD IT
IN THE CAR.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.499
YOU'LL LIKE HOW IT SMELLS.
SMELL IT.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.691
- DOCTOR...

16:44.730 --> 16:45.958
DETECTIVE CARLTON LASSITER.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.539
- DR. STEVEN REIDMAN.
THORNBURG SPECIALIST, CDC.

16:50.570 --> 16:53.630
- DR. REIDMAN IS THE FOREMOST
THORNBURG AUTHORITY

16:53.680 --> 16:55.671
NOT ONLY IN THIS STATE,
BUT IN ALL SEVEN CONTINENTS.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.143
HE'S HERE TO HELP US.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.374
- IS HE, JULES?

16:58.410 --> 16:59.900
NO OFFENSE, DOCTOR,

16:59.950 --> 17:02.669
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF
FREAKY-DEAKY STUFF GOING ON.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.280
HOW CAN WE BE SURE
THAT YOU'RE A LEGIT M.D.?

17:05.320 --> 17:09.108
- WELL, FOR STARTERS, I CARRY
ONE OF THESE IN MY POCKET.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.185
- HE'S LEGIT.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.982
- EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR,
I FEEL I'M THE MOST AT RISK

17:13.030 --> 17:15.726
BEING THAT THIS VIRUS
IS A PROFILING RACIST.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.365
I'M GOING TO NEED AN MRI,
A CAT SCAN, A PET SCAN,

17:18.400 --> 17:19.924
AND A BIOPSY OF EVERYTHING.

17:19.970 --> 17:21.437
- I'D LIKE SOME
MAC AND CHEESE,

17:21.470 --> 17:23.165
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS "ASK
FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT DAY."

17:23.210 --> 17:25.360
- SHAWN...
- [mutters] STOP IT!

17:25.410 --> 17:27.071
WHAT DO WE KNOW SO FAR?

17:27.110 --> 17:29.408
- I HAD THIS HOSPITAL PREPARED
AS SOON AS I HEARD

17:29.440 --> 17:31.476
THAT THE VIRUS
HAD BEEN STOLEN.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.740
NOW, THE CAFE PATRONS
ARE CURRENTLY IN ISOLATION

17:33.780 --> 17:34.940
ALONG WITH THE COURIER

17:34.980 --> 17:36.174
BECAUSE HE WAS
AROUND THE VIRUS A LOT.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.517
NOW, SO FAR, ONLY TWO

17:37.550 --> 17:39.381
ARE SHOWING THE EARLY SYMPTOMS
OF THORNBURG.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.251
- ONLY TWO?
THANK GOD.

17:41.290 --> 17:42.382
- I WILL HAZARD A GUESS

17:42.420 --> 17:45.059
THAT THEY TOUCHED
THE SAMPLE ACCIDENTALLY,

17:45.090 --> 17:46.728
BECAUSE THE VIRUS
IS NOT TYPICALLY EFFECTIVE

17:46.760 --> 17:47.920
AS AN AEROSOL.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.496
- UNLIKE AXE FOR MEN,

17:49.530 --> 17:50.963
WHICH IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.729
IT'S LIKE CATNIP FOR WOMEN.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.931
- AS I WAS SAYING,

17:54.970 --> 17:56.892
NORMALLY ONE
HAS TO COME IN CONTACT

17:56.940 --> 17:59.431
WITH AN INFECTED PERSON'S
SECRETIONS.

17:59.470 --> 18:02.507
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, IF ANY
OF THESE PEOPLE WERE INFECTED,

18:02.540 --> 18:05.668
THERE IS A LAB
LESS THAN TWO HOURS AWAY

18:05.710 --> 18:08.508
IN WHICH THEY ARE DEVELOPING
A NEW ANTIVIRAL

18:08.550 --> 18:10.609
THAT HAS SHOWN POSITIVE RESULTS
IN EARLY TESTING.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.517
- WHEN'S IT GONNA GET HERE?
- EN ROUTE AS WE SPEAK.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.518
AND SINCE OUR CULPRIT
HAS ALREADY USED HIS SAMPLE,

18:16.560 --> 18:17.857
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

18:17.890 --> 18:20.723
THAT WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM
PRETTY WELL BOTTLED UP.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.298
POTENTIAL DISASTER AVERTED.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.490
- SPEAKING OF DISASTERS,
DOCTOR,

18:25.530 --> 18:26.724
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION

18:26.770 --> 18:28.567
OF DETECTIVE LASSITER'S
HAIR?

18:28.600 --> 18:30.966
- WELL, SCIENTIFICALLY...

18:31.010 --> 18:34.901
IF HE WERE TO GROW IT, HIS EARS
WOULDN'T STICK OUT AS MUCH.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.476
- WELL, IF YOU--
- CARLTON.

18:36.510 --> 18:38.603
WE NEED TO GET AN I.D.
ON THE MAN WHO DID THIS.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.470
IS IT SAFE TO INTERVIEW
THE PATIENTS?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.715
- JUST REMEMBER TO WEAR
THE HAZMAT SUIT.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.479
- SPENCER ONE
TO GROUND CONTROL.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.523
I AM READY TO COMMENCE ORBIT.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.686
- [gurgling]

18:51.730 --> 18:53.823
- WE READ YOU LOUD AND CLEAR,
SPENCER ONE.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.555
GOOD LUCK.

18:56.330 --> 18:59.697
- GREETINGS,
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

18:59.730 --> 19:01.937
[gurgling]
- STOP [imitates gurgle], SHAWN.

19:01.970 --> 19:04.302
- ROGER THAT, GROUND CONTROL.
[gurgling]

19:04.340 --> 19:06.638
- SO, MELISSA,

19:06.670 --> 19:07.898
HELLO.

19:07.940 --> 19:11.148
DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE
SUSPICIOUS IN THE CAFE TODAY?

19:11.180 --> 19:13.614
ANYONE WHO ENTERED
OR LEFT ABRUPTLY?

19:13.650 --> 19:14.912
- NOT REALLY.

19:14.950 --> 19:16.474
BUT I WAS READING MY BOOK
MOST OF THE TIME.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.782
- I SEE.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.139
AND HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

19:19.190 --> 19:22.011
- NERVOUS, MOSTLY.
- PERFECT LY NORMAL.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.051
DO YOU NEED US TO CONTACT
ANYONE FOR YOU?

19:24.090 --> 19:26.285
A HUSBAND OR A BOYFRIEND?

19:26.330 --> 19:29.493
- UM, I'M SINGLE.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.964
BUT MY SISTER'S ON HER WAY.
- REALLY?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.195
- GUS, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.969
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.208
- MELISSA, HOW MANY SEXUAL
PARTNERS HAVE YOU HAD

19:39.240 --> 19:40.434
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.277
- SHAWN!

19:42.310 --> 19:43.402
[cell phone playing
Rump Shaker]

19:43.450 --> 19:44.599
- ENOUGH WITH THAT SONG
ALREADY.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.708
- I CAN'T REACH
MY BACK POCKET.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.217
YOU'LL HAVE TO PUNCH ME
IN THE ASS.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.774
- YOU MUST BE OUTTA YOUR MIND.
- JUST SOCK ME IN THE BUTT.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.117
- NO, SHAWN.

19:50.150 --> 19:51.686
- DO YOU GUYS WORK
FOR THE HOSPITAL?

19:54.760 --> 19:57.820
- SO YOU DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING
SUSPICIOUS IN THE CAFE.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.054
- NO.

19:59.090 --> 20:00.819
- ACCORDING TO YOUR FILE,
UNDER "MEDICATIONS,"

20:00.860 --> 20:03.192
YOU HAVE LISTED
NEITHER ROGAINE OR MINOXIDIL.

20:03.230 --> 20:04.993
IS THAT CORRECT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:05.030 --> 20:06.429
- REALLY?

20:06.470 --> 20:08.438
YOU DON'T WAN NA TRY
EITHER OF THOSE?

20:08.470 --> 20:10.836
- NO.
WHY?

20:10.870 --> 20:13.236
- DUDE, I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY SUIT.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.804
THERE'S SOME RANK SMELL
IN HERE NOW.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.808
- YOU'RE LIKE A GIANT
DUTCH OVEN.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.239
- WAIT A SECOND.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.077
I FEEL A BULGE
IN YOUR SWEATSHIRT POCKET.

20:20.110 --> 20:22.442
ARE THOSE YOUR DAMN CORNNUTS?
- OH, I WAS LOOKING FOR THOSE.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.811
- NOTHING SHOULD SMELL
THAT BAD.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.715
- GUS, YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT OFF.
- WHY NOT?

20:25.750 --> 20:28.412
- YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE
BETWEEN NACHO CHEESE HEAVEN

20:28.460 --> 20:32.180
AND SOMETHING THAT COULD
POTENTIALLY KILL YOU.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.721
WELL?
- I'M THINKING.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.889
- NINE PEOPLE QUESTIONED
AND NOTHING?

20:40.940 --> 20:44.501
WHAT NEXT?
- NEXT TASTE THESE.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.269
- OKAY, THE ANTIVIRALS
ARE HERE.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.301
LET'S GET THEM UNPACKED
AND ADMINISTERED TO THE SICK.

20:51.950 --> 20:54.771
- YESTERDAY, I WAS TOLD
TO GO AND PICK UP A COOLER

20:54.820 --> 20:56.276
FROM A LAB CALLED GENUTECH.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.810
- DUDE...

20:57.850 --> 20:59.511
SAME LAB THAT HAD
THE VIAL OF THORNBURG

20:59.550 --> 21:00.983
IS ALSO SUPPLYING THE CURE.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.157
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD?

21:02.190 --> 21:03.828
- I STILL SMELL LIKE
STINKY NUTS, SHAWN.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.784
- GUS, WE DON'T HAVE FOUR HOURS
TO RIFF ON THAT.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.890
LET'S GO.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.166
DUDE, CHECK IT OUT.
IT'S CHRISTOPHER LLOYD.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.430
- SHAWN, THAT MAN DOES NOT
LOOK LIKE CHRISTOPHER LLOYD.

21:16.470 --> 21:18.961
AND SHOW SOME RESPECT.
HE'S 14 TIMES SMARTER THAN YOU.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.307
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.570
- CAN I HELP YOU?

21:22.610 --> 21:24.043
- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE COPS
AND THE CDC

21:24.080 --> 21:25.047
ON THIS OUTBREAK THING.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.445
- OH, LOOK,
ALREADY TOLD THOSE GUYS

21:26.480 --> 21:27.549
THAT WE SHIPPED
ALL THE ANTIVIRALS

21:27.580 --> 21:28.945
THAT WE HAD
IN STORAGE.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.845
- YOU SHIPPED EVERYTHING YOU
HAVE FOR TWO SICK PATIENTS?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.482
- APPARENTLY THEY'RE
GOING TO NEED EVERY DROP.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.909
DR. REIDMAN SAYS
THAT THE FIRST PATIENT NEEDED

21:34.960 --> 21:37.451
FOUR TIMES THE DOSES
THAT WE'D ESTIMATED.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.629
AND THEY WANT TO ADMINISTER IT
TO EVERYONE JUST TO BE SAFE.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.093
- SO YOU'RE MAKING MORE?

21:41.130 --> 21:43.325
- NOT YET.
WE WERE SHUT DOWN A WEEK AGO.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.997
- FOR STRIKING A CLOCK TOWER
WITH LIGHTNING?

21:45.030 --> 21:47.169
- NO.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.067
WE LOST OUR FUNDING
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT

21:50.100 --> 21:53.479
DIDN'T SEE THORNBURG
AS A SERIOUS THREAT.

21:53.510 --> 21:58.004
BUT ALL THESE PEOPLE GETTING
SICK IS GREAT NEWS.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.473
GREAT FOR THE LAB, I MEAN.
AND GREAT FOR DR. MALLON.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.942
- DR. MALLON?

22:01.980 --> 22:03.516
- THIS IS HIS LAB.

22:03.550 --> 22:05.518
HE GOT THE FUNDING
TO OPEN UP THIS PLACE.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.780
HE'S BEEN WORKING ON THE
ANTIVIRAL DRUG FOR YEARS.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.458
BUT IF THIS THING
GETS WORSE,

22:09.490 --> 22:12.755
WE MIGHT START BACK UP.

22:12.790 --> 22:16.351
- EXCUSE US.
WE'RE GONNA SIDE BAR, EH?

22:20.330 --> 22:22.798
SO THIS DR. MALLON
SPENDS YEARS WORKING ON A CURE.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.569
HE DEVELOPS IT,
THEN HIS LAB GETS SHUT DOWN.

22:24.610 --> 22:25.838
THEN MIRACULOUSLY,
A FEW DAYS LATER,

22:25.870 --> 22:27.428
A THORNBURG OUTBREAK
HAPPENS?

22:27.480 --> 22:29.630
- HE TOOK A SAMPLE OF THE VIRUS
TO INFECT PEOPLE,

22:29.680 --> 22:32.706
AND THEN FORCE THE GOVERNMENT
TO PUT HIS LAB BACK IN BUSINESS.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.412
- OOH...
WE'RE BACK!

22:35.450 --> 22:37.247
- HI.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.282
- SO TELL ME, SINCE DR. MALLON
ISN'T HERE,

22:39.320 --> 22:40.878
WHEREABOUTS
MIGHT WE FIND HIM?

22:40.920 --> 22:43.218
- I'M NOT SURE.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL HIM.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.854
BUT YOU CAN LOOK
FOR HIS ADDRESS IN THAT BOX.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.528
IT'S THE STUFF THAT
WAS LEFT OVER FROM HIS OFFICE

22:47.560 --> 22:48.595
AFTER IT WAS EMPTIED.

22:48.630 --> 22:50.825
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.589
DUDE, DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE
ANY RADIOACTIVE SPIDERS HERE?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.562
- SHAWN, FOCUS.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.659
- LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.259
A FAN OF THE THEATER.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.805
- GUS...

23:06.850 --> 23:09.842
- NO, WHY?

23:09.880 --> 23:12.440
- WE'VE ALREADY GOT THIS GUY
QUARANTINED.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.227
[line ringing]

23:19.260 --> 23:21.091
- SHAWN, WE'RE A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.950
THE SECOND PERSON WHO TESTED
POSITIVE FOR THORNBURG

23:23.000 --> 23:24.365
JUST BROKE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL
BEFORE WE TREATED HIM

23:24.400 --> 23:25.628
WITH THE ANTIVIRAL.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.366
- YEAH, UH, LET ME TAKE
A PSYCHIC STAB AT THAT--

23:28.400 --> 23:30.630
PASTY WHITE GUY DESPERATELY
IN NEED OF HAIR PLUGS?

23:30.670 --> 23:32.558
- WOW, THAT'S RIGHT.

23:32.610 --> 23:34.635
- YEAH, WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM BEING SICK.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.240
I'M SENSING THAT HE HAS
HIS OWN STASH OF THE CURE.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.645
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

23:38.680 --> 23:40.443
- BECAUSE NOT ONLY
DID HE INVENT IT,

23:40.480 --> 23:42.641
I'M SENSING THAT HE ALSO
STOLE THE THORNBURG

23:42.680 --> 23:44.409
AND THEN RELEASED IT.

23:44.450 --> 23:46.315
- OH, GOD.

23:46.350 --> 23:47.612
- IT'S OKAY.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.457
LUCKILY THERE WAS ONLY
ONE VIAL OF THE VIRUS.

23:49.490 --> 23:50.855
AND HE'S ALREADY USED THAT.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.482
- EXCUSE ME.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.191
- WE SHIPPED THREE VIALS
OF THE VIRUS,

23:54.230 --> 23:57.028
NOT ONE.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.164
- THERE'S TWO MORE?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.134
- SCRATCH THAT, JULES.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.559
WE HAVE A BIG, BIG PROBLEM.

24:15.150 --> 24:18.415
- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY LED A MANHUNT BEFORE,

24:18.450 --> 24:20.213
SO MAYBE I SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO INSTRUCT THE TROOPS

24:20.250 --> 24:21.649
ON FINDING MALLON.

24:21.690 --> 24:24.989
- NO, I ORDERED THE CORONER
TO DIAGNOSE THE FIRST VICTIM.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.328
I CALLED IN THE CDC.
I SHOULD DO THE BRIEFING.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.248
- OKAY.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.894
JUST REMEMBER--
EXUDE CONFIDENCE AND STRENGTH,

24:31.930 --> 24:33.295
BUT ALSO HEART AND WARMTH.

24:33.330 --> 24:35.139
YOU WANT TO GET BEHIND
THE TROOPS.

24:35.170 --> 24:38.230
TRY TO PROJECT INTELLIGENCE
WITHOUT SOUNDING TOO...

24:38.270 --> 24:41.205
- POMPOUS?
- EXACTLY.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.073
YOU MIGHT JUST GET THIS.

24:47.450 --> 24:49.270
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.514
- GIVE US YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE.

24:50.550 --> 24:53.018
- ATTENTION.
- EYES ON DETECTIVE O'HARA.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.551
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.956
- THIS IS DR. ANTHONY MALLON.

24:56.990 --> 24:59.185
FINDING HIM IS THE DEPARTMENT'S
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

24:59.230 --> 25:01.095
- FIND HIM BUT DO NOT
CONFRONT HIM.

25:01.130 --> 25:04.224
- YES, THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.
DO NOT CONFRONT HIM.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.521
IF YOU DO LOCATE HIM--

25:05.570 --> 25:09.131
- CALL FOR BACKUP.
- THANK YOU, AGAIN, DETECTIVE.

25:09.170 --> 25:10.194
DO NOT STARTLE HIM.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.969
- HE IS CARRYING
A VERY DANGEROUS--

25:12.010 --> 25:13.238
- VIRUS!

25:17.750 --> 25:20.548
- IF I MAY, DETECTIVE.

25:20.580 --> 25:23.549
LOCATING AND BRINGING HIM IN
SAFELY IS CRUCIAL.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.979
AND KEEP IN MIND THE BEST PLACE
FOR MALLON TO RELEASE HER

25:26.020 --> 25:28.250
IS IN A PUBLIC CROWDED PLACE,

25:28.290 --> 25:30.986
PREFERABLY WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE
COMING AND GOING FREQUENTLY.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.054
YES?

25:32.090 --> 25:33.057
- HER?

25:33.090 --> 25:34.193
- THORNBURG.

25:34.230 --> 25:36.551
- YOU REFER TO THE VIRUS
IN THE FEMININE TENSE?

25:36.600 --> 25:38.261
- INDEED.
IF YOU KNEW HER AS I DO,

25:38.300 --> 25:41.098
THERE'S NO MISTAKING HER
FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SHE.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.129
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.194
- NEITHER DO WOMEN.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.708
- I HEAR THAT.

25:45.740 --> 25:46.934
- HM.

25:46.970 --> 25:49.871
A FAN OF THE THEATER.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.772
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

25:52.810 --> 25:55.176
UH, I THINK I KNOW WHAT
THE NEXT TARGET MIGHT BE.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.370
I SEE THE BUS STATION...

25:57.420 --> 25:59.115
AND THE SANTA BARBARA
PUBLIC THEATRE.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.515
- BOTH OF THOSE TARGETS
WOULD WORK

26:00.550 --> 26:01.858
BECAUSE BOTH HAVE HEAW FOOT
TRAFFIC.

26:01.890 --> 26:03.084
BUT I WOULD BET ON
THE BUS STATION

26:03.120 --> 26:05.680
BECAUSE THERE'S GREATER
POPULATION TURNOVER.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.254
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
YOU HEARD HIM.

26:07.290 --> 26:08.848
- LET'S MOVE.
- LET'S--

26:08.900 --> 26:10.424
- EXCUSE ME.

26:10.460 --> 26:12.428
YOU SAY YOU DIVINED THIS
PSYCHICALLY?

26:12.470 --> 26:14.267
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- FASCINATING.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.767
IF YOU SHOULD PASS AWAY,

26:15.800 --> 26:18.109
I WOULD LOVE TO DISSECT
YOUR TEMPORAL LOBE.

26:18.140 --> 26:19.801
- SURE.
I CAN'T POSSIBLY SEE WHY NOT.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.172
BUT I'M HOPING YOU GET US ALL
THROUGH THIS THING ALIVE.

26:22.210 --> 26:24.371
- YES, IN THAT CASE, I WOULD
LOVE TO GET MY HANDS

26:24.410 --> 26:26.799
ON A SAMPLE OF YOUR DNA.

26:26.850 --> 26:29.375
- WEIRD.
UNCOMFORTABLE.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.978
CONSIDER IT DONE.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.942
- YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY THE
BRAINS BEHIND THIS OPERATION,

26:32.990 --> 26:34.082
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET MINE.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.486
- I COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT YOUR SECRETIONS.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.149
HOWEVER, I WOULD LOVE TO GET
MY CRANIOMETER AROUND

26:40.190 --> 26:42.420
THAT GIANT RAISINET OF YOURS.

26:42.460 --> 26:43.996
OR IS IT A GOOBER?

26:44.030 --> 26:46.760
POSSIBLY A MILK BALL.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.467
- I SAY MILK BALL.
IT'S MILK BALL.

26:57.410 --> 26:58.672
- COVER THOSE EXITS.

26:58.710 --> 27:01.247
I DO NOT WANT THIS GUY
GETTING AWAY FROM US AGAIN.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.979
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T START A PANIC.

27:06.020 --> 27:07.885
GO!

27:07.920 --> 27:10.753
[glass crunches]

27:10.790 --> 27:13.179
OH, HELL.

27:17.030 --> 27:20.625
CITIZENS, STAY AWAY
FROM THIS AREA.

27:20.670 --> 27:22.535
YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY
BEEN EXPOSED

27:22.570 --> 27:24.561
TO A DEADLY BIOLOGICAL AGENT.

27:24.610 --> 27:27.067
IS IT IMPORTANT
THAT YOU DO NOT LEAVE

27:27.110 --> 27:29.305
BECAUSE YOU COULD SPREAD IT
TO YOUR LOVED ONES

27:29.340 --> 27:31.069
AND KILL THEM.

27:35.380 --> 27:39.441
- DETECTIVE,
THIS IS A BROKEN LIGHTBULB.

27:41.390 --> 27:43.881
- AS YOU WERE.

27:43.930 --> 27:44.954
WHAT?

27:44.990 --> 27:47.788
SOME LIGHTBULBS
HAVE HALOGEN GAS IN THEM.

27:47.830 --> 27:50.094
- AND TUNGSTEN.
THERE'S A FUN WORD.

27:50.130 --> 27:52.360
TUNGSTEN,
TUNGSTEN, TUNGSTEN.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.368
CORRECT ION--IT'S ONLY FUN
TO SAY IT TWICE.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.061
- SPENCER, WHY DON'T YOU
GET OUT OF SIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

27:56.100 --> 27:57.704
MALLON KNOWS WHAT YOU
LOOK LIKE,

27:57.740 --> 27:58.968
AND YOU'RE NOT TRAINED IN
COVERT SURVEILLANCE.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.068
- REALLY?

28:00.110 --> 28:01.304
WHAT PART OF TRAINING

28:01.340 --> 28:03.945
IS ANNOUNCING OUR PRESENCE
WITH A MEGAPHONE?

28:03.980 --> 28:05.868
- JUST GO HIDE IN A BATHROOM
AND STAY OUT OF OUR WAY.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.172
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GO.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.770
BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU TOLD US TO.
GUS HAS TO TINKLE.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.845
- YEAH.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.415
HE MUST BE OUT OF HIS MIND
IF HE THINKS I'M GOING TO HIDE

28:14.460 --> 28:15.859
IN A BUS STATION BATHROOM
ALL DAY.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.380
- HA HA!

28:25.430 --> 28:26.419
GUS, THAT'S HIM.

28:26.470 --> 28:27.789
THAT'S HIM!

29:18.290 --> 29:19.439
- HOLD IT!

29:24.490 --> 29:27.186
NO!
- NO!

29:27.230 --> 29:28.549
[all shouting]

29:36.800 --> 29:38.904
-AAH!

29:43.240 --> 29:46.004
- YOU SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT,
SHAWN.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.915
THE SEAL ON THE VIAL
IS UNBROKEN.

29:47.950 --> 29:50.214
WE ARE LUCKY AS LINT
THAT YOU GRABBED IT.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.512
- OH, I'M NO HERO, STEVE.

29:51.550 --> 29:52.847
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

29:52.890 --> 29:54.949
THAT ANYONE WITH INCREDIBLE
UPPER BODY STRENGTH

29:54.990 --> 29:57.049
AND NATIVE AMERICAN CHEEKBONES
WOULDN'T DO.

29:57.090 --> 29:58.057
MM.

29:59.060 --> 30:02.621
- HERO?
BECAUSE OF YOU, WE LOST MALLON.

30:02.660 --> 30:04.025
HE PROBABLY RAN
WHEN HE SAW YOU.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.765
YOU BLEW THE WHOLE OPERATION,
SPENCER.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.939
I TOLD YOU
TO GO HIDE IN THE TOILET.

30:07.970 --> 30:09.460
ALL UNITS,
MOVE TO SECONDARY TARGET.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.206
THAT'S THE THEATER
ON MAIN STREET.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.037
- GUS, SOMETHING DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO ME.

30:13.070 --> 30:15.573
HE WAS ON HIS WAY OUT
WHEN I SPOTTED HIM.

30:15.610 --> 30:17.737
WHY DID HE LEAVE BEFORE
RELEASING THE JUJU MUGUMBO?

30:17.780 --> 30:21.011
- HE ABORTED HIS PLAN.

30:21.050 --> 30:22.870
- THAT GUY SAW MALLON
HOVERING BY A NEWSSTAND.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.148
SAID HE WAS SWEATING
PRETTY BADLY.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.282
- REALLY?

30:35.800 --> 30:37.449
I'M SENSING
HE WAS LIMPING AS WELL.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.297
BARLEY NOTICEABLE.
HE'S SICK, JULES.

30:39.330 --> 30:40.319
HE HAS THORNBURG.

30:40.370 --> 30:42.235
- I THOUGHT HE HAD THE CURE.

30:42.270 --> 30:44.101
- UH, APPARENTLY THEY'RE GONNA
NEED EVERY DROP.

30:44.140 --> 30:46.404
DR. REIDMAN SAYS
THAT THE FIRST PATIENT

30:46.440 --> 30:48.476
NEEDED FOUR TIMES THE DOSAGE
THAT WE'D ESTIMATED.

30:48.510 --> 30:49.829
- HE DOES.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.404
BUT HE DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.247
- HE MUST'VE STARTED SHOWING
SYMPTOMS WHEN HE GOT HERE

30:53.280 --> 30:54.247
AND THEN HE BOOKED.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.838
- I CAN SEE HIM.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.416
IT'S EITHER HIM
OR MICHAEL IRONSIDE.

30:57.450 --> 30:59.281
- WHY WOULD YOU BE HAVING
A VISION OF MICHAEL IRONSIDE?

30:59.320 --> 31:01.117
- EXACTLY.
I KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING.

31:19.910 --> 31:21.775
LOOKING FOR THIS?

31:21.810 --> 31:23.778
IT'S THE LAST OF YOUR CURE.

31:23.810 --> 31:25.869
IT'S WHY YOU CAME BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL, ISN'T IT?

31:25.910 --> 31:28.219
YOU'VE BEEN SELF-MEDICATING,
BUT YOU'RE STILL INFECTED

31:28.250 --> 31:30.218
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH OF THIS STUFF IT TAKES

31:30.250 --> 31:31.478
TO FIGHT YOUR LITTLE VIRUS.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.147
- GIVE IT TO ME.
NOW!

31:33.190 --> 31:34.214
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.852
WE KNOW EVERYTHING, MAN.

31:35.890 --> 31:38.222
WE KNOW YOU DID ALL OF THIS
TO SAVE YOUR LAB.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.626
- THAT WASN'T WHY.

31:40.660 --> 31:43.823
WHEN THEY SHUT ME DOWN,
THEY LEFT YOU AND ME

31:43.860 --> 31:46.021
AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
WIDE OPEN.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.459
[coughing]
DO YOU KNOW HOW EASILY

31:48.500 --> 31:51.162
THIS STUFF
COULD BE TURNED INTO A WEAPON?

31:51.210 --> 31:54.634
BUT NOW, AFTER THIS,
WE'LL BE READY.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.602
[coughing]
- WOW...

31:56.640 --> 31:59.279
THAT'S NOT YOUR GARDEN VARIETY
CRAZY PERSON LOGIC.

31:59.310 --> 32:00.868
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

32:00.910 --> 32:02.616
I'LL MAKE YOU A TRADE.

32:02.650 --> 32:06.416
CURE FOR THE LAST VIAL
OF YOUR VIRUS.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.998
- LET ME SEE IT.

32:18.030 --> 32:21.568
- SAME TIME.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.137
DON'T TOUCH ME, MAN.

32:24.170 --> 32:25.159
- SHAWN.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.689
- IS IT THERE?

32:38.720 --> 32:40.711
[glass break]
- OW!

32:41.860 --> 32:43.111
JULES, WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:43.160 --> 32:45.128
- SHAWN,
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.559
- HEY!

32:51.600 --> 32:52.965
GIVE ME THAT MEDICINE BACK!
GIVE IT TO ME NOW!

32:53.000 --> 32:54.297
- IDIOT!

32:54.340 --> 32:56.934
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH HERE
TO HELP ANYBODY.

32:56.970 --> 32:58.460
- WELL, THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE
SOMEWHERE.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.568
JUST TELL ME HOW.

32:59.610 --> 33:00.907
I COULD SAVE YOU BOTH.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.773
- VICTORIA.

33:03.810 --> 33:04.777
- WHO'S THAT?

33:04.810 --> 33:08.541
- TWO HOURS FROM HERE.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.969
TOO FAR.
[grunting]

33:17.260 --> 33:18.955
- JULES...

33:26.370 --> 33:28.361
- I THINK IT'S PROBABLE
SHE CONTRACT ED IT--

33:28.400 --> 33:31.665
IN WHICH CASE, SHE'S GONNA
NEED THE ANTIVIRAL ASAP.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.031
BASED ON MY OBSERVATIONS
OF THE OTHER PATIENTS,

33:34.080 --> 33:37.334
I'VE CONCLUDED THAT JUST MASK
AND GLOVES WILL BE SUFFICIENT

33:37.380 --> 33:39.701
IF YOU DECIDE TO ENTER
THE DRAGON.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.069
- WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO MALLON WAS TALKING ABOUT

33:41.120 --> 33:43.247
WHEN HE SAID "VICTORIA."

33:43.280 --> 33:44.383
- IT COULD BE ANYBODY.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.411
A GIRLFRIEND, RELATIVE,
WHO KNOWS.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.816
I GOT EVERY DETECTIVE IN
THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING INTO IT.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.658
I JUST HOPE WHOEVER IT IS
HAS THE CURE.

33:51.690 --> 33:55.399
- VICTORIA!

33:55.430 --> 33:56.988
- VICTORIA'S NOT A PERSON.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:57.030 --> 33:58.395
- VICTORIA IS A LAKE.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.318
ISN'T THERE A LAKE VICTORIA
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE?

34:00.370 --> 34:02.838
- A POND, REALLY.
IT'S ABOUT TWO HOURS FROM HERE.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.838
- TWO HOURS FROM HERE.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.360
- I USED TO PRACTICE
FIGURE SKATING THERE

34:06.410 --> 34:08.298
THERE WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.900
I MEAN, ICE HOCKEY.

34:10.940 --> 34:13.807
- I'M GETTING A VERY STRONG HIT
THAT HE HAS A PLACE THERE.

34:13.850 --> 34:15.044
- LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.344
- YEAH, UH, GUS, UH,
STAY WITH JULES,

34:17.380 --> 34:19.211
AND CALL ME
IF HER CONDITION CHANGES.

34:19.250 --> 34:22.310
- ALL RIGHT.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.664
- APPARENTLY MALLON BOUGHT
THIS PLACE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO.

34:34.700 --> 34:36.258
- THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.437
HE STASHED A BUNCH
OF THE CURE UP HERE,

34:37.470 --> 34:38.937
KNOWING IT WOULD BE
THE PERFECT HIDEOUT

34:38.970 --> 34:40.232
AFTER HE RELEASED THE VIRUS.

34:40.270 --> 34:43.068
WE SHOULD--WE SHOULD
CREEP AROUND BACK.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.411
[vicious barking]

34:54.050 --> 34:55.210
WHO ARE YOU, MICHAEL VICK?

34:55.260 --> 34:56.557
- I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT HIM.

34:56.590 --> 34:57.852
HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.118
- HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
HE'S A DOG.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.229
- WELL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY BETTER IDEAS?

35:00.260 --> 35:01.727
- MAYBE.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.751
[barking and snarling]

35:04.970 --> 35:06.619
DO YOU STILL KEEP
ALL OUR SOFTBALL GEAR

35:06.670 --> 35:09.559
IN THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR?
- YEAH, WHY?

35:09.600 --> 35:11.158
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHOA, SIT!

35:11.210 --> 35:12.632
SIT!

35:12.670 --> 35:15.332
[barking]

35:15.380 --> 35:18.178
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T FREAK OUT.

35:18.210 --> 35:19.347
- I'M NOT FREAKING OUT.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.677
- BECAUSE IT'S NORMAL
IF YOU DO.

35:20.710 --> 35:22.644
- I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S FREAKING OUT, GUS.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.841
- YEAH, BECAUSE THORNBURG
IS FREAKY.

35:24.890 --> 35:28.519
BUT DON'T WORRY.
IT LIKES WHITE PEOPLE.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.427
- YOU THINK SHAWN AND LASSITER
ARE HAVING ANY LUCK?

35:31.460 --> 35:32.882
- I KNOW ONE THING.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.397
IF THE CURE IS OUT THERE,

35:34.430 --> 35:37.058
SHAWN WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO FIND IT.

35:37.860 --> 35:38.895
- ON THREE.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.864
TH REE!

35:40.900 --> 35:42.561
[dog barking]

35:42.600 --> 35:44.659
GO, LASSIE!
RUN LIKE THE WIND!

35:49.740 --> 35:52.174
[screaming like a little girl]

35:56.580 --> 35:58.810
- DUDE, DID YOU GET IT?
- WHAT?

35:58.850 --> 36:00.511
YEAH, YEAH, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

36:00.550 --> 36:02.017
UH, LASSITER'S RUNNING IT
DOWN TO REIDMAN NOW.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.049
- NICE.
ARE YOU OKAY?

36:03.090 --> 36:04.455
- I'M DOING--I'M DOING GREAT.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.378
I THINK I JUST HAD A
LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE, GUS.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.557
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YEAH, I WAS--I WAS RUNNING.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.556
I WAS BEING CHASED
BY A VERY ANGRY ROI IWEILER

36:10.600 --> 36:13.364
WEARING, UH, CATCHER'S GEAR
AND I HAD, UH, UH, AN EPIPHANY.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.732
- WAIT A SECOND--THE ROI IWEILER
WAS WEARING CATCHER'S GEAR?

36:15.770 --> 36:17.533
- NO, GUS, THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.
I WAS WEARING THE GEAR.

36:17.570 --> 36:18.832
- OH, OKAY, THAT WORKS.
OKAY.

36:18.870 --> 36:20.303
- SO I'M RUNNING
AND I REALIZE TWO THINGS.

36:20.340 --> 36:21.773
ONE, I HAVE A GIANT PIECE
OF BEEF JERKY

36:21.810 --> 36:23.072
IN MY LEFT FRONT POCKET.

36:23.110 --> 36:24.372
SO I GRAB AND I TOSS IT,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

36:24.410 --> 36:25.638
THE ROI IWEILER DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT ME ANYMORE.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.773
TWO, I REALIZE. ..

36:27.810 --> 36:31.485
IN LIFE WE NEVER HAVE
AS MUCH TIME AS WE THINK WE DO.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.044
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

36:33.090 --> 36:34.614
- I MEAN JULES.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.616
I MEAN, ALL THIS TIME, RIGHT?
WE TALK, WE DO OUR THING.

36:36.660 --> 36:38.116
AND I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF
SOMETHING'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

36:38.160 --> 36:39.422
BETWEEN US,
IT WILL HAPPEN.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.121
JUST, BOOM, LIKE MAGIC BEANS
COMING DOWN ON ME.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.219
BUT THE TRUTH IS, MY GOD,

36:43.260 --> 36:46.923
SHE COULD DIE TODAY AND SHE
WOULD NEVER KNOW HOW I FEEL.

36:46.970 --> 36:49.438
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

36:51.470 --> 36:53.700
- I'M GONNA DO THIS.

36:55.710 --> 36:57.234
- GOOD NEWS, PUFFY.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.202
- YEAH, I HEARD.
THEY GOT THE CURE.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.468
- I HADN'T HEARD THAT,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.748
DETECTIVE O'HARA
DOESN'T HAVE THORNBURG.

37:02.780 --> 37:03.974
- REALLY?

37:04.020 --> 37:05.578
- ALL THE TESTS
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

37:05.620 --> 37:06.848
SHE'S GOT
QUITE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM.

37:06.890 --> 37:09.882
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.024
UH, DO YOU MIND IF I'M
THE FIRST ONE TO TELL HER?

37:12.060 --> 37:14.051
- BE MY GUEST.
- GREAT.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.498
- EXCUSE ME, SHAWN.
- NOT NOW, GUS.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.634
- THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.
- CAN IT WAIT?

37:22.670 --> 37:24.831
I'M ABOUT TO TELL JULIET
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.064
WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN
TO THE CAFETERIA

37:26.110 --> 37:27.338
AND GET HER
SOME TRI-COLORED JELL-O?

37:27.370 --> 37:28.576
- SHAWN.
- PLEASE!

37:28.610 --> 37:31.408
I'VE GOTTA GET THROUGH THIS,
MAN, COME ON.

37:32.910 --> 37:34.639
THE...

37:34.680 --> 37:36.841
LOOK, JULES, THERE ARE THINGS
THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW,

37:36.880 --> 37:38.040
AND I HAVE TO SAY THEM.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.014
- JULIET, YOU DON'T HAVE
THE THORNBURG VIRUS.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.142
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

37:41.190 --> 37:42.384
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

37:42.420 --> 37:44.627
- NO, DR. REIDMAN
JUST TOLD ME.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.449
- OH, MY GOD!

37:47.490 --> 37:49.128
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
MORE TIME THAN YOU THOUGHT.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.594
- OH, MY GOD!

37:53.530 --> 37:55.236
OH, I AM SO HAPPY.

37:55.270 --> 37:58.535
I AM NOT GOING TO DIE
IN THIS DISGUSTING ROBE.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.868
- THAT'S SO--
THAT IS SO GOOD!

38:00.910 --> 38:04.505
BUT, UH, I STILL WANT TO SAY
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY,

38:04.550 --> 38:06.347
IF THAT'S OKAY.

38:07.850 --> 38:11.741
- SURE.
- OKAY.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.248
UH, JULES, UH, HOW DO
I WANT TO SAY THIS? OKAY.

38:15.290 --> 38:16.518
YOU KNOW HOW WHEN
WE WERE KIDS

38:16.560 --> 38:18.289
THERE WERE
ALL THOSE COOL PRIZES

38:18.330 --> 38:19.888
AT THE BOTTOM
OF CEREAL BOXES?

38:19.930 --> 38:21.795
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.457
WELL, THERE--THERE ARE
TWO KINDS OF KIDS.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.593
THERE'S THE KID
WHO FLIPPED THE BOX OVER

38:25.630 --> 38:27.120
AND OPENED IT FROM THE BOTTOM

38:27.170 --> 38:28.637
AND GRABBED THE PRIZE
RIGHT AWAY.

38:28.670 --> 38:31.400
AND THEN THERE WAS THE KID
WHO WAITED PATIENTLY

38:31.440 --> 38:33.635
AND ATE BOWL AFTER BOWL
OF CEREAL

38:33.670 --> 38:37.629
UNTIL THE PRIZE
JUST TUMBLED OUT ON ITS OWN.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.649
THERE'S ALSO A THIRD KID
NAMED MIKEY

38:40.680 --> 38:42.568
WHO WILL EAT ANYTHING,
INCLUDING THE PRIZE.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.144
BUT, UH, HE'S NOT REALLY
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

38:44.180 --> 38:46.045
- OKAY. AND?

38:46.090 --> 38:47.409
- I DIDN'T WAIT.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.678
I DIDN'T WAIT
FOR MY DECODER RING

38:48.720 --> 38:52.759
OR MY FRANKENBERRY
ACTION FIGURE WHEN I WAS A KID.

38:52.790 --> 38:55.452
SO WHAT
AM I WAITING FOR NOW?

38:58.400 --> 39:02.166
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I DON'T
WANT TO MISS OUT ON THE PRIZE.

39:02.200 --> 39:06.000
- WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY, SHAWN?

39:08.610 --> 39:11.204
- THAT I--

39:11.240 --> 39:13.800
- HMM?
- THAT...

39:16.820 --> 39:19.118
I DON'T KNOW.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.618
- HEY.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.220
I HEARD THE GOOD NEWS.

39:24.260 --> 39:25.386
COME HERE.
- HI.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.751
OOH!
- OOH, SORRY. JUST--

39:27.790 --> 39:29.189
- WHOA, YEAH.
- OH, OH, SORRY.

39:29.230 --> 39:30.959
TOO MUCH?
- A LITTLE BIT.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.798
- JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
- I WASN'T.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.072
- HEY, GUYS.

39:48.110 --> 39:49.611
I HEARD YOU WERE HERE.

39:49.650 --> 39:50.674
- DON NY.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.914
HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
- GOOD.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.440
NO, MORE THAN GOOD
THANKS TO YOU GUYS.

39:53.490 --> 39:56.084
- YOU'RE THANKING US
FOR BEING IN QUARANTINE?

39:56.120 --> 39:57.417
- WELL, YES.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.678
BECAUSE GET THIS--
WHILE I WAS BACK THERE,

39:59.730 --> 40:01.652
I, UH, I MET A GIRL.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.520
- OH, DONNY, NO.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.869
- OH, NO.
NO, NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.367
OKAY, THIS ONE
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.698
SHE, UM, SHE JUST GOT HERE
FROM RUSSIA.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.628
YEAH, AN D--OKAY.
OKAY.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.729
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A LANGUAGE BARRIER

40:13.770 --> 40:15.579
BUT SHE IS SO SWEET,
YOU KNOW?

40:15.610 --> 40:17.430
AND APPARENTLY
SHE ONLY WORKS NIGHTS.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.402
SO CLEARLY I'M FIRED,

40:19.450 --> 40:21.372
AND WE CAN NOW SPEND
ALL OUR DAYS TOGETHER,

40:21.410 --> 40:25.244
AND SHE'S ALREADY TALKING
ABOUT MOVING IN.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.248
- DONNY, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THE OUTSIDE POSSIBILITY

40:28.290 --> 40:30.485
THAT THIS GIRL
COULD BE USING YOU?

40:30.520 --> 40:32.021
- USING ME?

40:32.060 --> 40:33.925
SHAWN, I HARDLY THINK SO.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.052
- YOU GOT YOUR WATCH BACK,
RIGHT?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.089
- YES.

40:36.130 --> 40:38.257
- SO WHERE IS IT?

40:38.300 --> 40:39.722
WH--

40:40.600 --> 40:43.535
- OLGA...

40:43.570 --> 40:45.834
- OLGA.

40:45.870 --> 40:48.509
GOOD LUCK, DON NY.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.714
- GREAT NEWS.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.274
ALL THE PATIENTS WERE RELEASED
FROM THE HOSPITAL

40:58.320 --> 41:00.049
WITH A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

41:00.090 --> 41:03.389
AND HERE YOU GO.
PROFESSIONALLY DRY CLEANED.

41:03.420 --> 41:06.059
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU
BORROW SOMEONE'S CLOTHES.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.048
- THIS SHOULD BE WRINKLED
AND STINKY.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.261
- ARE YOU STILL OBSESSING
OVER THE JULIET THING?

41:12.300 --> 41:14.791
- NO.
- YES, YOU ARE.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.068
LOOK, LET'S GO CHECK OUT

41:16.100 --> 41:17.738
THE SYDNEY J. FURIE
FILM FESTIVAL.

41:17.770 --> 41:20.807
I'M TALKING IRON EAGLE II,
LADY SINGS THE BLUES,

41:20.840 --> 41:23.206
AND IRON EAGLE IV.

41:23.240 --> 41:27.506
- WELL, IF THE TAKING
OF BEVERLY HILLS IS INCLUDED,

41:27.550 --> 41:29.017
COUNT ME IN.
- STEVE!

41:29.050 --> 41:30.415
WHAT ARE YOU
AND YOUR PORN 'STACHE

41:30.450 --> 41:31.610
DOING HERE IN OUR OFFICE?

41:31.650 --> 41:34.244
- A DEAL IS A DEAL.
- IT IS, INDEED.

41:34.290 --> 41:35.518
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:35.560 --> 41:36.652
- I AM NOT LEAVING HERE

41:36.690 --> 41:39.727
WITHOUT YOUR DNA.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.728
- RIGHT...

41:42.760 --> 41:44.864
I DID SAY
THAT I WOULD, UH...

41:44.900 --> 41:46.060
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.068
I JUST DRANK ABOUT A LITER
OF TEAS' TEA.

41:52.170 --> 41:54.400
- LET'S TAKE SOME MEASUREMENTS
OF THAT DOME.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.499
- WHAT?
- SHALL WE?

41:56.540 --> 41:59.873
HOLD STILL.

41:59.910 --> 42:01.138
- SHAWN!
