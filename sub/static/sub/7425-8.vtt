00:00.081 --> 00:01.884
<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast...

00:01.885 --> 00:03.781
Someone's got you
hunting beasts.

00:03.782 --> 00:05.783
Vincent only has
two missions left.

00:05.818 --> 00:06.780
That's not a good thing?

00:06.805 --> 00:08.805
The last mission
could very well be Vincent.

00:11.257 --> 00:14.226
<i>- He's alive.</i>
<i>- What's my next move?</i>

00:14.260 --> 00:16.126
We should have Thanksgiving
dinner with my father.

00:16.161 --> 00:16.672
What?

00:16.677 --> 00:18.195
He already admitted
to knowing about Muirfield.

00:18.196 --> 00:19.463
Whoever's after Vincent,

00:19.498 --> 00:21.599
they want to exterminate
all beasts.

00:21.634 --> 00:23.434
That's because
they're dangerous.

00:23.468 --> 00:25.588
Tori, this is Detective
Chandler's boyfriend, Vincent.

00:27.272 --> 00:30.408
I know that she has some sort
of effect on you.

00:30.442 --> 00:31.975
<i>I told you we shouldn't</i>
<i>have come here.</i>

00:32.009 --> 00:34.078
Tori, are you okay?

00:34.112 --> 00:36.914
<i>There are two of them now.</i>

00:36.948 --> 00:38.949
Just get up here; I told you
my driver would be fast.

00:38.983 --> 00:40.951
She's going into the city.
Now, I promise,

00:40.985 --> 00:43.187
<i>your secret's safe with me.</i>

00:43.221 --> 00:45.989
I can't verify
it's your handler,

00:46.024 --> 00:47.865
but according to the documents
Gabe brought up,

00:47.892 --> 00:49.359
which apparently includes

00:49.393 --> 00:50.627
a new target...
Tori.

00:52.129 --> 00:53.964
Do you hear that?
Church bells, right?

00:53.998 --> 00:55.131
He could live by a church.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.332
That call with his handler,

00:56.367 --> 00:58.168
JT and Tess heard church bells

00:58.202 --> 00:59.436
in the background.

01:20.724 --> 01:22.324
Tori...

01:22.358 --> 01:23.859
listen to me, okay?

01:23.894 --> 01:26.495
Whoever did this

01:26.529 --> 01:28.664
knows me, they know
what I can do.

01:28.699 --> 01:31.968
More importantly,
they know what I can't do.

01:32.002 --> 01:33.569
And I cannot step off this pad

01:33.604 --> 01:35.137
free you,

01:35.171 --> 01:37.339
and get us out of here
before this place blows.

01:37.373 --> 01:39.575
Not without your help.

01:39.609 --> 01:41.876
The only chance we have

01:41.911 --> 01:45.514
is if these people didn't know
what we can't do together.

01:47.083 --> 01:48.750
How you...

01:48.784 --> 01:50.385
help me.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.254
Tori, look at me.

01:52.288 --> 01:55.356
Listen, listen.

01:55.390 --> 01:57.291
Now don't look away, okay?

01:58.861 --> 02:00.662
Now, I need you
to stop being afraid

02:00.696 --> 02:03.031
and start getting pissed
at what they're doing to us,

02:03.065 --> 02:04.766
what they want,

02:04.800 --> 02:06.434
and they want to kill us.

02:06.468 --> 02:10.404
We're not gonna let them,
are we?

02:12.907 --> 02:14.074
We are gonna hunt them down,

02:14.109 --> 02:16.043
we are gonna find them,

02:16.077 --> 02:18.179
and we are gonna stop them,

02:18.213 --> 02:20.681
and we are gonna
kill them.

02:35.630 --> 02:37.297
Catherine,
can you please slow down?

02:37.331 --> 02:39.299
You can't save Vincent
if you get yourself killed.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.201
Don't worry about me;
just keep up.

02:41.235 --> 02:43.270
It's not just Vincent
we need to worry about, either.

02:43.304 --> 02:44.804
It's Tori also.

02:44.838 --> 02:46.306
We don't even know
where she is, either.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.907
Now that Reynolds
knows she's a beast...

02:47.941 --> 02:49.543
He might be after her, too.

02:49.577 --> 02:51.611
We got to get back
to the city fast.

02:51.646 --> 02:53.213
Hang on; it's Tess.

02:53.247 --> 02:55.315
Where's Cat?
I'm following her.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.816
We're heading
to Vincent's house, but why?

02:56.850 --> 02:58.585
All right, we just got word
of an explosion

02:58.619 --> 03:00.787
at Tori's penthouse.
What?

03:00.821 --> 03:02.488
Do you have any idea
where Tori is?

03:02.522 --> 03:03.302
No.

03:03.327 --> 03:05.124
Do you have any idea
where Vincent is?

03:05.125 --> 03:06.726
No, but what are the chances

03:06.760 --> 03:08.061
the explosion was an accident?

03:08.095 --> 03:09.996
I'll meet you there in an hour.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.263
All right.

03:11.298 --> 03:13.132
Catherine, you still there?

03:13.167 --> 03:16.268
Yeah, what did Tess want?

03:25.044 --> 03:27.446
Cat, no, no.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.315
No what? Talk to me.

03:29.349 --> 03:31.149
Look, the arson investigators
don't know enough yet.

03:31.184 --> 03:32.818
Okay, what do they know?

03:32.852 --> 03:34.285
They know that if
anybody was inside...

03:34.320 --> 03:35.787
No, Vincent could've gotten out.

03:35.822 --> 03:39.257
Except Reynolds knew
what his powers were, Catherine,

03:39.291 --> 03:41.727
and if it was a trap...
You mean what his powers <i>are.</i>

03:43.696 --> 03:45.263
Maybe he's at the houseboat.

03:45.297 --> 03:46.658
No, he's not, all right?
I checked.

03:46.665 --> 03:48.133
And he's not with JT either.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.534
If Gabe's right,
and this was a trap,

03:49.568 --> 03:50.668
he would've been inside.

03:50.703 --> 03:52.103
I really... I'm sorry.

03:52.137 --> 03:53.538
You can't tell me
that he's dead.

03:53.572 --> 03:55.206
I don't believe it.

03:55.241 --> 03:56.881
I won't believe it;
it can't end this way.

03:58.310 --> 03:59.644
All right, listen, you're right.

03:59.678 --> 04:00.778
We don't even know

04:00.812 --> 04:02.113
if they were
in there for sure,

04:02.147 --> 04:03.114
so let's wait
until we do know.

04:03.148 --> 04:05.617
Either way, we need to focus

04:05.651 --> 04:06.984
on getting your father
and making him pay

04:07.018 --> 04:08.485
for everything he's done.

04:08.519 --> 04:11.321
Vincent, Muirfield,
beast hits, everything.

04:11.356 --> 04:13.157
And we can't do
that without you,

04:13.191 --> 04:14.625
because we need your help

04:14.659 --> 04:16.961
to figure out
how to bring him down

04:16.995 --> 04:18.562
and fast, before he bolts,

04:18.596 --> 04:19.964
which you know he will do,

04:19.998 --> 04:21.899
especially if he
thinks he succeeded.

04:21.933 --> 04:24.167
So go home, take a shower,

04:24.201 --> 04:25.869
take a minute,
and then come back

04:25.903 --> 04:27.337
and meet us at
the precinct, okay?

04:27.372 --> 04:28.472
Okay.

04:47.258 --> 04:48.758
I'm listening.

04:48.793 --> 04:51.227
Both the targets
have been eliminated.

04:51.262 --> 04:52.428
Do you have proof?

04:52.462 --> 04:54.197
Proof?

04:54.231 --> 04:55.898
They were vaporized.

04:55.932 --> 04:58.066
The proof is telling you
that the job is done.

04:58.101 --> 05:00.235
You said that last time,
and it wasn't done.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.705
Yeah, because last time
you gave me the wrong intel

05:02.739 --> 05:04.340
on Vincent.

05:04.374 --> 05:06.175
Okay, let's just say
that this time,

05:06.209 --> 05:08.611
I overcorrected.

05:08.645 --> 05:11.280
Now pay me.

05:11.315 --> 05:13.381
Or the next place I rig
is gonna be yours.

05:39.775 --> 05:41.209
Vincent.

05:44.780 --> 05:46.347
Oh, God, thank God you're okay.

05:53.155 --> 05:54.755
I thought you were dead.

05:54.789 --> 05:57.091
Not yet.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.760
Um...

05:59.794 --> 06:01.162
My father...

06:01.196 --> 06:03.096
I know; I figured it out,

06:03.130 --> 06:05.866
and I will deal with him,
but first we need to help her.

06:12.497 --> 06:16.497

06:22.408 --> 06:23.700
Is she goona be ok?

06:23.728 --> 06:25.328
Yeah, I think so.

06:25.363 --> 06:27.330
She just got
knocked unconscious.

06:27.365 --> 06:29.433
You know, that was
a pretty big explosion.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.368
We were lucky to get
out of there at all.

06:31.402 --> 06:33.070
How did you get out?

06:33.104 --> 06:35.838
It was Tori.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.674
I... I don't know.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.909
It's like she amplified
my power, you know?

06:39.944 --> 06:41.711
I was stronger, I was faster.

06:41.745 --> 06:44.047
Everything happened
at the same time.

06:44.081 --> 06:46.749
She broke the chains, I got
to her, I got out the window

06:46.784 --> 06:49.619
just before the blast.

06:49.653 --> 06:51.253
Obviously Reynolds didn't count

06:51.288 --> 06:52.822
on Tori and I
working together, huh?

07:00.430 --> 07:03.299
Listen, Cat, I hope you
don't mind me bringing her.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.901
I just... I-I didn't know
where else to go, you know?

07:05.935 --> 07:08.904
But based on the way
that you and I last...

07:08.938 --> 07:11.607
Look, obviously,
we have a lot to talk about,

07:11.641 --> 07:14.142
including the kiss,
but I-I think that our fight

07:14.176 --> 07:16.111
had more to do
with my father than us.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.946
Come on, it wasn't your fault.

07:17.981 --> 07:20.716
You had no idea he was
behind this; none of us did.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.383
But now that I know,

07:22.418 --> 07:24.219
I'm gonna kill him.

07:24.253 --> 07:25.386
V-Vincent, where are you going?

07:25.421 --> 07:27.055
You-you can't do that.

07:27.090 --> 07:28.490
Why not?

07:28.524 --> 07:30.325
Because-because you can't.

07:30.359 --> 07:31.726
It's wrong.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.828
Wrong?
Catherine, he brainwashed me,

07:33.862 --> 07:36.397
he took away my life,
my memories,

07:36.432 --> 07:38.933
then he made me kill for him,
and when he was done with me,

07:38.967 --> 07:41.269
he tried to kill me, so I'm not
giving him another chance.

07:41.303 --> 07:42.770
I know that he is
a terrible man,

07:42.804 --> 07:45.106
and he has only done
terrible things to you,

07:45.141 --> 07:47.407
but-but he's not a beast.

07:47.442 --> 07:49.276
He's a human being,

07:49.310 --> 07:51.512
and you can't just kill somebody
in cold blood.

07:51.546 --> 07:54.281
You can't cross that line again,
otherwise...

07:54.315 --> 07:56.483
Otherwise what?

07:56.518 --> 07:59.453
Otherwise,
you lose your humanity.

07:59.487 --> 08:01.488
You are lost to everything

08:01.523 --> 08:03.923
we have fought so hard
to keep you from becoming.

08:03.958 --> 08:07.528
If you cross that line,
there's no turning back for you

08:07.562 --> 08:10.096
or for us.

08:10.131 --> 08:13.867
So there is still an us.

08:13.901 --> 08:15.802
I hope so.

08:15.836 --> 08:17.437
I want there to be.

08:17.472 --> 08:20.807
But there can't be
if you choose to do this,

08:20.841 --> 08:23.777
because I can't be with
someone who ever would.

08:23.811 --> 08:25.444
That's a line

08:25.479 --> 08:28.181
that I can't cross,
not as a cop or as a person.

08:28.215 --> 08:30.483
I can't just let him get away with it.
He won't.

08:30.517 --> 08:31.885
We will find a way,

08:31.919 --> 08:33.653
I promise.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.520
In fact, Gabe is working
on a plan right now,

08:35.556 --> 08:37.956
and I am going to go meet
him at the precinct.

08:37.991 --> 08:39.625
I'm gonna change and go.

08:39.659 --> 08:41.660
Just take care of Tori.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.497
Vincent, trust me.

08:44.531 --> 08:47.733
My father is going to jail.

08:47.767 --> 08:50.303
One way or the other.

08:53.073 --> 08:55.507
Okay.

08:58.044 --> 08:59.311
She's sleeping on your couch?

08:59.345 --> 09:00.645
Recuperating on my couch.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.147
Do not be jealous of her.

09:02.182 --> 09:04.249
I'm not jealous.
I just don't like

09:04.283 --> 09:06.384
what Tori does to Vincent,
how she affects him.

09:06.419 --> 09:08.053
It's like ever since she came
into his life,

09:08.088 --> 09:09.754
he's gone farther and farther
to his beast side.

09:09.788 --> 09:11.189
Okay, one beast at a time.

09:11.224 --> 09:12.390
First we'll deal
with your father,

09:12.425 --> 09:13.958
then little Miss Glowy Eyes.

09:17.029 --> 09:19.764
Here, drink this.

09:19.798 --> 09:22.133
Don't you have anything
a little stronger?

09:30.308 --> 09:32.910
You know,
we took a pretty hard fall.

09:32.945 --> 09:35.246
We're lucky to be alive.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.081
Thanks to you.

09:37.116 --> 09:39.283
Well, actually,
thanks to the both of us.

09:39.317 --> 09:42.419
You know I couldn't have done it
without you.

09:44.789 --> 09:46.223
I don't understand.

09:46.258 --> 09:47.958
Why did he want to kill me?

09:47.992 --> 09:49.926
What did I do?
Tori, you didn't do anything.

09:49.961 --> 09:51.228
Okay, Reynolds believes

09:51.263 --> 09:53.364
that it's his job
to eliminate...

09:53.398 --> 09:54.965
people like us.

09:54.999 --> 09:56.700
Why?

09:56.735 --> 09:59.102
Long story.

09:59.137 --> 10:01.138
The short of it is he believes

10:01.172 --> 10:03.940
that we, well,

10:03.975 --> 10:06.743
might just be like your father.

10:06.778 --> 10:08.078
Who's gonna stop him
from trying again?

10:08.112 --> 10:09.379
I mean, it's not like we can go

10:09.413 --> 10:10.613
to the police
for justice, right?

10:10.648 --> 10:12.482
Catherine is the police,

10:12.516 --> 10:14.951
and she's going after him
as we speak.

10:14.986 --> 10:16.753
Right.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.721
So she's going after her father?

10:20.791 --> 10:23.359
Let's just let it play out.

10:25.429 --> 10:27.630
I'll get you some ice.

10:33.804 --> 10:34.770
Come in!

10:34.805 --> 10:37.006
I thought it'd be easier

10:37.040 --> 10:39.408
to coordinate from my place,
since Reynolds has already

10:39.442 --> 10:40.943
compromised my office computer.

10:40.977 --> 10:42.444
Sit.
No thanks.

10:42.478 --> 10:43.913
Let's just get started.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.447
Okay, I've got a plan,

10:45.481 --> 10:47.482
but to be honest, it is
a bit of a long shot.

10:47.517 --> 10:49.785
We're gonna try
and get your father

10:49.819 --> 10:50.952
to incriminate himself.

10:52.622 --> 10:54.623
What? This-this is the plan?

10:54.657 --> 10:57.025
You want to get my father,
who's been five steps

10:57.059 --> 10:59.294
ahead of us this entire time
to suddenly confess?

10:59.329 --> 11:01.363
I can't believe this.

11:01.397 --> 11:03.037
I promised Vincent
that we would bust him.

11:03.065 --> 11:04.700
And we will.
How?

11:04.734 --> 11:07.202
First, Reynolds needs to believe
that Vincent and Tori

11:07.236 --> 11:09.437
really are dead, so we
can get him to think

11:09.471 --> 11:11.005
that someone is
blackmailing him

11:11.040 --> 11:12.440
with evidence that links him

11:12.474 --> 11:13.634
to all of the beast killings.

11:13.642 --> 11:14.642
Wait, is there evidence

11:14.676 --> 11:15.877
that links him to the killings?

11:15.911 --> 11:17.545
We didn't think so at first,

11:17.579 --> 11:19.513
but we might be onto something.
Tess?

11:19.548 --> 11:20.982
Okay, what's the first thing
you examine

11:21.016 --> 11:22.149
when investigating a murder?

11:22.183 --> 11:23.617
The crime scene.
All right.

11:23.652 --> 11:24.685
What's the second
thing you examine?

11:24.720 --> 11:26.987
Body.
Right.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.489
So we did a search of every one
of the bodies that was

11:28.523 --> 11:29.790
admitted to the medical
examiner's office.

11:29.825 --> 11:30.791
Guess what we found?

11:30.826 --> 11:32.626
Bodies?

11:32.661 --> 11:34.061
Actually, no.

11:34.095 --> 11:36.029
Sebastian Clifton,
Zachary Hayes,

11:36.064 --> 11:38.165
Eddie Long, three of the beasts
that Vincent killed.

11:38.199 --> 11:40.500
Each one was admitted,
but they all suspiciously

11:40.534 --> 11:42.870
bypassed autopsies and went
straight to the crematorium.

11:42.904 --> 11:45.005
Reynolds was worried
about someone finding them.

11:45.039 --> 11:46.639
And if he's willing
to risk everything

11:46.674 --> 11:48.909
to make those bodies disappear,
maybe all we have to do

11:48.943 --> 11:51.478
is find one of them
and use it to rattle him.

11:51.512 --> 11:53.747
But I thought that you said
the bodies were cremated.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.415
Not necessarily.
Yeah.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.684
New York has a three-week
backlog of John Does.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.219
There's a chance one of these
bodies is still at play.

12:00.254 --> 12:02.555
Okay, but who's
blackmailing Reynolds?

12:02.590 --> 12:04.357
We are. Problem is we
need him to think someone

12:04.392 --> 12:05.892
with real evidence is.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.561
Someone who legitimately
knows enough to harm him,

12:08.596 --> 12:10.497
beyond bodies.

12:10.531 --> 12:12.198
Uh, what about the man
who kidnapped Tori?

12:13.267 --> 12:14.934
The one who rigged the bomb?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.568
Sure, that'd be great.
We don't know who he is.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.005
What if Vincent tracked him.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.572
He's done it before.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.541
Well, if he can,
he'd better hurry.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.543
Reynolds just booked
a flight to Geneva.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.612
Which means unless we find
someone to blackmail him

12:26.646 --> 12:28.847
before tomorrow, it's over.
We lose Reynolds.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.682
And I lose Vincent

12:30.717 --> 12:32.851
because he will kill him.

12:35.241 --> 12:36.953
That's it?

12:37.267 --> 12:39.068
That's your plan?

12:39.102 --> 12:40.435
Basically, yeah.

12:40.470 --> 12:42.504
Why would Reynolds
incriminate himself,

12:42.539 --> 12:44.306
especially with the
body that I killed?

12:44.340 --> 12:46.758
Well, we're not trying
to build a case that we can try in court.

12:46.759 --> 12:48.371
We don't have
the evidence for that.

12:48.372 --> 12:49.184
Obviously.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.585
We're hoping we can scare my
father into thinking that we do.

12:51.850 --> 12:53.050
Or rather, into thinking

12:53.084 --> 12:54.485
that his accomplice does.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.819
Someone that Reynolds
might think has

12:55.854 --> 12:56.954
a lot of incriminating
evidence against him.

12:56.988 --> 12:59.623
And, uh, to get this body,

12:59.658 --> 13:03.293
you guys want me to walk into
the M.E.'s office and steal it?

13:03.327 --> 13:05.896
You won't be stealing it,
JT, okay?

13:05.930 --> 13:08.431
You're a professor, just say
that you need a cadaver

13:08.466 --> 13:10.333
for an upcoming study.
And don't worry,

13:10.368 --> 13:11.501
Tess will be there
with you the whole time.

13:11.536 --> 13:14.304
Perfect.

13:14.338 --> 13:17.340
Anyway, it looks like
our best option is Zach's body,

13:17.375 --> 13:19.075
because there's still
a good chance that he's

13:19.109 --> 13:20.743
among the John Does
waiting to be cremated.

13:20.778 --> 13:23.580
Dare I ask how you
actually killed Zach?

13:23.614 --> 13:26.349
It might help us
narrow down the search.

13:26.384 --> 13:28.485
I broke his neck.

13:28.519 --> 13:31.821
I twisted it right around.

13:31.855 --> 13:33.856
Lovely, okay.

13:33.891 --> 13:35.825
So, we'll just look for that.

13:35.859 --> 13:37.193
While you look for the man
who kidnapped Tori.

13:37.227 --> 13:38.360
Can you do that?

13:38.395 --> 13:40.496
Not without Tori.

13:40.530 --> 13:42.331
He took her to
her apartment.

13:42.365 --> 13:45.367
She saw him rig the explosives.

13:45.402 --> 13:46.968
Does Tori even know
how to track?

13:47.003 --> 13:48.671
I'll teach her.

13:48.705 --> 13:50.506
Sorry, just to be clear.

13:50.540 --> 13:53.108
Without the accomplice alive,

13:53.142 --> 13:54.577
this plan doesn't work.

14:03.853 --> 14:05.854
No, no, no, I just need you
to keep your eye on the place

14:05.888 --> 14:07.989
'cause I-I won't be back
in town until...

14:09.025 --> 14:09.958
Well, hold-hold on.

14:12.228 --> 14:13.895
Agent Reynolds.

14:13.930 --> 14:15.163
Check your encrypted email.

14:15.198 --> 14:17.632
Who is this?

14:36.684 --> 14:39.220
You okay?

14:39.254 --> 14:40.254
I still can't believe

14:40.288 --> 14:41.856
that he tried to kill me.

14:41.890 --> 14:44.158
Us.

14:44.192 --> 14:46.660
What type of a person thinks
that he can get away with that?

14:46.694 --> 14:48.595
Reynolds isn't just FBI.

14:48.630 --> 14:50.231
He was the main player
in Muirfield.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.766
So he thinks
he can get away with anything.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.668
But he won't.

14:54.702 --> 14:57.271
All right.

14:57.305 --> 14:58.705
How do I do this?

14:58.740 --> 15:00.073
Close your eyes.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.644
Trust me.

15:07.415 --> 15:09.783
Now focus
on your inner beast senses.

15:09.817 --> 15:12.051
I don't know what that means.

15:12.086 --> 15:13.953
Don't worry.
It'll come to you.

15:13.988 --> 15:16.089
Just concentrate.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.258
Focus.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.725
Smell.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.427
Sound.

15:21.461 --> 15:22.628
Movement.

15:22.663 --> 15:24.563
Vibration.

15:24.598 --> 15:28.233
Become one
with your surroundings.

15:28.268 --> 15:31.570
And when you see him...

15:31.605 --> 15:33.739
open your eyes.

15:33.774 --> 15:35.240
See who?

15:35.275 --> 15:39.111
The accomplice, the man
that brought you here.

15:39.145 --> 15:40.780
But he's not here.
Of course he is.

15:40.814 --> 15:41.914
He never left.

15:41.948 --> 15:44.283
You just have to find him.

15:46.186 --> 15:49.487
Close your eyes.

15:49.522 --> 15:52.224
Concentrate.

15:55.161 --> 15:56.128
Sound.

15:56.162 --> 15:57.729
Smell.

15:57.763 --> 15:58.730
Movement.

15:58.764 --> 15:59.698
Vibration.

16:17.649 --> 16:19.851
I see him.

16:19.885 --> 16:21.485
<i>Good.</i>

16:21.519 --> 16:22.753
Whoa.

16:22.787 --> 16:25.823
Tell me what you see,
what you smell.

16:28.327 --> 16:30.294
He's got a small cut.

16:30.329 --> 16:31.795
He's bleeding.

16:41.305 --> 16:44.842
He smells like his work.

16:44.876 --> 16:46.610
<i>Like his bombs.</i>

16:46.644 --> 16:49.145
It's all over him, it's...

16:49.180 --> 16:51.514
it's overwhelming.

16:56.854 --> 16:59.622
That was amazing.

16:59.656 --> 17:03.126
I had no idea.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.627
What's next?

17:04.661 --> 17:06.662
Next.

17:06.696 --> 17:08.964
We track him down.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.040
Uh, that's not him.

17:18.074 --> 17:19.675
What Professor Forbes means is

17:19.710 --> 17:21.911
it's not the right subject
for the study.

17:21.944 --> 17:24.079
I thought you said your study
was about neck injuries.

17:24.114 --> 17:25.747
Yeah, but we're looking
for something more...

17:25.781 --> 17:28.017
twisted... type.

17:28.050 --> 17:29.851
Mind if we keep browsing?

17:29.886 --> 17:31.820
Okay.

17:31.854 --> 17:33.889
Browsing?

17:33.924 --> 17:35.157
We're not at a bookstore.

17:35.191 --> 17:37.091
Just try to be a
little cool, okay?

17:37.126 --> 17:38.593
Is that what the problem is?

17:38.628 --> 17:39.895
I'm not cool enough for you?

17:39.929 --> 17:41.362
What are you talking about?

17:43.198 --> 17:44.599
Nope, next.

17:44.634 --> 17:46.701
We actually need a
male for this study.

17:46.736 --> 17:48.069
I'm sorry to be so picky.

17:48.103 --> 17:50.104
Of course.

17:50.139 --> 17:51.740
Did you not get my text?

17:51.774 --> 17:53.774
Yes, I got your text--
all 11 of them.

17:53.809 --> 17:55.709
Well, were you ever
planning on responding?

17:55.744 --> 17:57.211
JT, now is not the time

17:57.246 --> 17:58.579
and certainly
not the place

17:58.613 --> 18:00.248
to be having this
conversation, okay?

18:00.282 --> 18:02.516
Okay, fine.

18:02.551 --> 18:04.352
And besides, just because
it happened once,

18:04.386 --> 18:06.287
doesn't mean it has
to happen again.

18:06.322 --> 18:08.456
I thought you just said this
wasn't the time or place.

18:08.490 --> 18:10.190
'Cause it seems like
we're having the conversation.

18:10.224 --> 18:11.859
We're not. Let's just
find Zach, okay?

18:11.893 --> 18:14.829
Fine.

18:17.499 --> 18:19.633
Whoa, bingo, that's him!

18:19.668 --> 18:23.070
I mean, uh, that's a good one.

18:23.104 --> 18:24.371
Broken neck-wise.

18:24.405 --> 18:25.806
Uh, solid injury there.

18:25.841 --> 18:27.040
We'll take him.

18:27.075 --> 18:28.075
It.

18:32.013 --> 18:34.848
What?

18:37.918 --> 18:39.652
Okay, look, I am telling you
this will work.

18:39.687 --> 18:41.088
I used it to bust a perp once

18:41.122 --> 18:42.555
who was pretending
to be a victim using it.

18:42.590 --> 18:43.790
Menthol ointment?

18:43.824 --> 18:44.991
Just put a little
on your fingers

18:45.025 --> 18:46.225
and pretend to dab your eyes.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.660
I promise you,
you will tear up.

18:47.695 --> 18:49.496
I am so angry
with my father right now,

18:49.530 --> 18:51.731
I am not sure
anything will work.

18:51.765 --> 18:53.099
Just remember
what we're trying to do here.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.434
Play on his emotions,
make him worry

18:55.469 --> 18:56.569
that someone is
closing in on him.

18:56.604 --> 18:57.937
So kicking him
in the face is out?

18:57.972 --> 19:01.240
Yeah.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.881
Not now!

19:09.983 --> 19:11.917
Dad?

19:11.951 --> 19:15.621
Catherine,
I wasn't expecting you.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.690
Sorry, my idea.
Spur of the moment thing.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.926
Lowan.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.928
What's going on?

19:22.962 --> 19:25.263
Uh, Gabe's gonna help
me with Vincent.

19:25.297 --> 19:27.499
Thought maybe
we could join forces.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.867
See if we can figure out

19:28.902 --> 19:30.536
who Vincent's
handler is together.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.770
Yeah. Please, sit.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.843
Well, have you found anything?

19:38.877 --> 19:40.345
Well, actually, maybe.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.680
We got an anonymous
tip around noon today.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.150
A tip, really? About?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.985
Well, it was kind of cryptic,
but someone else

19:48.020 --> 19:49.687
apparently knows
about the beast killings.

19:49.721 --> 19:52.623
Or at least that's what
I took from the call. You?

19:52.658 --> 19:54.025
No, definitely, I just don't...

19:54.059 --> 19:55.560
I don't know why they called us.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.361
They didn't give us
any new information.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.130
Did you recognize the voice?

20:00.165 --> 20:01.699
Digitized.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.634
But it seemed credible
because whoever it was

20:03.669 --> 20:06.002
told us to check-in with the
M.E.'s office and sure enough.

20:06.037 --> 20:08.038
All of the beast bodies
had admitted there.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.374
But one of them
has gone missing.

20:10.408 --> 20:12.976
Missing?
Zachary Hayes, remember him?

20:13.010 --> 20:14.311
He's the guy
who attacked Catherine

20:14.345 --> 20:16.080
at her reunion
a couple of weeks ago?

20:16.114 --> 20:17.981
Well, what about him?

20:18.015 --> 20:21.351
He's, um...

20:21.386 --> 20:23.519
it's one of Vincent's friends.

20:26.223 --> 20:28.157
Muirfield apparently
experimented on him, too.

20:28.192 --> 20:29.325
That's probably why

20:29.359 --> 20:30.694
the Handler had him killed.

20:30.728 --> 20:32.361
But why would he suddenly take

20:32.396 --> 20:33.396
the body out of the morgue?

20:33.430 --> 20:35.198
And why call the cops?

20:38.402 --> 20:41.770
Unless it wasn't the Handler.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.373
Interesting.

20:44.408 --> 20:46.576
Do you think maybe
he had an accomplice?

20:46.610 --> 20:49.945
He could be using Zach's body

20:49.980 --> 20:53.082
to blackmail the Handler,
maybe called us

20:53.117 --> 20:55.450
to make the Handler think
that he'd turn him in

20:55.485 --> 20:56.752
if he didn't pay.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.386
What do you think?

20:58.421 --> 21:01.523
I think, uh...

21:03.593 --> 21:05.293
It makes sense.

21:05.328 --> 21:07.962
Which means if we can find
the accomplice first,

21:07.997 --> 21:10.031
we can try and get him to turn

21:10.065 --> 21:13.034
the Handler in anyway.

21:13.068 --> 21:15.770
Meanwhile, we'll follow up
with the M.E.'s Office,

21:15.804 --> 21:16.904
and see if we can track him
down from there.

21:16.939 --> 21:19.573
Keep me posted.

21:19.608 --> 21:22.744
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

21:50.104 --> 21:51.571
That's not possible.

21:53.274 --> 21:55.241
You're supposed to be dead, man.

21:57.211 --> 21:59.780
I'm hard to kill.

22:00.882 --> 22:02.215
Don't move.

22:05.553 --> 22:07.820
Don't move.

22:07.854 --> 22:10.690
I said don't move!

22:10.724 --> 22:13.293
I don't know how you got
out of there, all right?

22:13.327 --> 22:14.694
But either I'm walking
away from this,

22:14.728 --> 22:15.995
or neither of us are.

22:16.029 --> 22:18.764
You know I'll find you again.

22:18.799 --> 22:21.167
Maybe...

22:21.201 --> 22:22.434
maybe not.

22:22.468 --> 22:24.170
I'll take
my chances.

22:25.839 --> 22:27.039
No!

22:39.419 --> 22:41.353
What have you done?

22:42.522 --> 22:45.090
We needed him alive.

22:49.862 --> 22:51.963
We needed him alive!

22:53.125 --> 22:55.125
Well, that's that.
Uh, Katherine.

22:55.151 --> 22:57.438
She didn't have a choice, okay?
She had to do it.

22:57.758 --> 23:00.059
What, now you're
defending it?

23:00.094 --> 23:02.295
No, but he had a bomb on him,
he had his finger on the detonator.

23:02.329 --> 23:04.697
But Tori got to him
before the bomb went off.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.065
Couldn't she
have done that

23:06.100 --> 23:07.867
without killing him?
I'm sorry.

23:07.901 --> 23:09.202
Oh, you're sorry.
Great.

23:09.236 --> 23:10.470
I didn't mean to,

23:10.504 --> 23:12.538
it just... happened.

23:12.572 --> 23:14.673
But you did do it,
and now our only chance

23:14.708 --> 23:16.376
of getting my father
to confess is dead.

23:16.410 --> 23:18.544
So what?

23:18.578 --> 23:19.812
It was a stupid
plan anyway.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.079
Excuse me?
Tori...

23:21.114 --> 23:22.848
No, it was,
you said so yourself.

23:22.883 --> 23:25.885
I also said it was
our best chance.

23:25.919 --> 23:27.352
Right.

23:27.387 --> 23:28.654
To save her father.

23:28.688 --> 23:30.055
The man who tried
to blow us up.

23:30.089 --> 23:31.590
Exactly, Tori.

23:31.625 --> 23:33.325
We don't just kill
people out of revenge,

23:33.359 --> 23:34.326
we arrest them.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.327
It's called the law.

23:35.361 --> 23:36.928
Well, the law
kind of sucks.

23:36.962 --> 23:39.931
Especially when people
like her father

23:39.965 --> 23:41.733
get away with almost
trying to kill us.

23:41.767 --> 23:43.435
That isn't right,
either, is it?

23:43.469 --> 23:45.170
No, but...
Okay, wait.

23:45.204 --> 23:47.005
You just want to take the law
into your own hands?

23:47.040 --> 23:49.374
Decide for yourself
who's innocent or guilty,

23:49.409 --> 23:51.176
who lives
or dies?

23:51.210 --> 23:52.610
Is this what
you feel, too?

23:52.645 --> 23:54.045
Is this what
you taught her?

23:54.079 --> 23:55.346
Of course not, but...

23:55.380 --> 23:56.781
But what, Vincent?

23:56.815 --> 23:58.249
Are you seriously
okay with this?

23:58.283 --> 24:00.051
I don't want Reynolds

24:00.085 --> 24:01.553
to get away with it,
either, okay?

24:01.587 --> 24:03.187
You know he will
find a way.

24:03.221 --> 24:05.023
So, wait, now you want
to kill him, too?

24:05.057 --> 24:06.424
I want justice.

24:06.458 --> 24:07.859
So do we.

24:07.893 --> 24:09.927
But you can't
give it to us. We can.

24:09.961 --> 24:11.195
Don't you see?

24:11.229 --> 24:12.729
This is what we were
talking about.

24:12.764 --> 24:15.132
This is exactly the line
that you can't cross.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.567
If you do,

24:16.601 --> 24:18.369
everything is lost,
Vincent, everything.

24:18.403 --> 24:19.937
He didn't try to kill you.

24:19.971 --> 24:21.605
It doesn't matter.

24:21.639 --> 24:24.241
You can't do this,
no matter what.

24:24.276 --> 24:25.876
It's the only thing
that separates

24:25.910 --> 24:27.410
good from bad, us from...

24:27.445 --> 24:28.879
Beasts?

24:28.913 --> 24:30.213
Like me?

24:30.247 --> 24:31.414
Like Vincent?

24:36.988 --> 24:38.589
Do you agree with this?

24:40.491 --> 24:41.958
I don't know.

24:44.027 --> 24:45.261
<i>Easy for her</i>

24:45.296 --> 24:46.829
to take the moral
high ground

24:46.863 --> 24:48.465
when all she cares about
is saving her father's ass.

24:48.499 --> 24:50.066
Tori, it's not just
about that, okay?

24:50.101 --> 24:51.301
Bunch of
sanctimonious crap...

24:51.335 --> 24:52.668
how dare she
lecture us?

24:52.703 --> 24:54.404
She's acting like
we're the bad guys.

24:54.438 --> 24:55.638
We didn't do
anything wrong.

24:55.672 --> 24:56.939
We were the ones
who were wronged.

24:56.974 --> 24:58.173
By somebody who's
been-been using you,

24:58.208 --> 25:00.175
hurting you,
for months.

25:00.210 --> 25:01.978
Yeah, believe me, I know.
So what are you gonna do about it?

25:02.012 --> 25:04.313
Vincent, why are you
fighting this?

25:04.347 --> 25:05.815
Fighting what?

25:05.849 --> 25:08.183
Fighting who you
really are, inside.

25:08.218 --> 25:09.451
Catherine's right.

25:09.486 --> 25:12.254
You have to choose
who you want to be,

25:12.288 --> 25:15.857
not based on the past,
but on the future.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.359
And the only way
to do that

25:17.393 --> 25:19.027
is to stop fighting
your inner nature,

25:19.061 --> 25:20.629
our inner nature.

25:20.663 --> 25:22.431
Look at me.

25:24.167 --> 25:25.434
You saved me,
Vincent.

25:25.468 --> 25:26.868
You opened my eyes

25:26.902 --> 25:28.770
to a world that I could
have never imagined.

25:28.804 --> 25:32.107
You showed me what
I was born to be,

25:32.141 --> 25:33.842
and because
of that, I...

25:33.876 --> 25:35.944
I feel free

25:35.978 --> 25:38.513
for the first time
in my life.

25:38.547 --> 25:41.349
Let me return
the favor.

25:41.383 --> 25:44.218
Let me help you
feel what I feel.

25:44.253 --> 25:47.355
Let's take care
of Reynolds...

25:47.389 --> 25:48.889
together,

25:48.923 --> 25:51.459
so that he can
never hurt us again.

25:54.396 --> 25:56.330
Well, this sucks.

25:56.365 --> 25:59.200
Yeah, just like the last year and
a half of my life.

25:59.234 --> 26:01.169
You don't mean that.

26:01.203 --> 26:03.504
Don't I?

26:03.539 --> 26:04.872
Okay.

26:04.906 --> 26:06.140
Maybe I don't.

26:06.174 --> 26:08.142
But... remember
when I said

26:08.176 --> 26:09.409
I felt like I was
losing Vincent?

26:09.443 --> 26:10.641
There's still
a chance to save him.

26:10.642 --> 26:11.977
I mean, if we can bring down
Reynolds before he...

26:12.002 --> 26:13.714
No, it's...

26:13.715 --> 26:15.683
it's too late,
he already made his choice.

26:15.717 --> 26:18.251
Maybe I've been kidding myself
this entire time.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.820
Maybe... maybe love
really is blind.

26:20.854 --> 26:23.156
Tori's right.

26:23.191 --> 26:25.158
Vincent's more
like her than me,

26:25.193 --> 26:27.093
which means...

26:27.127 --> 26:28.828
maybe I never really
could change him.

26:28.862 --> 26:30.530
Maybe he didn't
want to change.

26:30.565 --> 26:33.166
Now you're just letting her
get in your head.

26:33.201 --> 26:34.401
Or...

26:34.435 --> 26:36.269
maybe it's time
to let go.

26:36.304 --> 26:38.004
Stop fighting.

26:38.038 --> 26:39.371
Stop trying
to save someone

26:39.406 --> 26:40.773
who can't
save himself.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.109
Or won't.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.677
Guys, we have
an idea.

26:44.712 --> 26:46.378
New plan?

26:46.413 --> 26:48.247
Same plan,
slight adjustment.

26:48.281 --> 26:50.416
Vincent got
the Bombmaker's phone.

26:50.450 --> 26:52.685
- So?
- So...

26:52.720 --> 26:54.786
we can still use it
to threaten Reynolds with blackmail.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.288
But the Bombmaker's dead.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.090
Well, Reynolds
doesn't know that.

26:58.124 --> 27:00.125
So we just
contact Reynolds,

27:00.159 --> 27:01.960
make him think that
the Bombmaker wants to meet

27:01.994 --> 27:03.395
and then get him
to confess.

27:03.430 --> 27:04.730
Confess to who?

27:04.764 --> 27:05.931
To me.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.702
I will convince
Reynolds that I got to

27:09.736 --> 27:11.536
the Bombmaker first
and that I'm the one

27:11.570 --> 27:13.271
who's blackmailing him.
He won't be surprised.

27:13.305 --> 27:14.706
He knows I've been
on his trail.

27:14.741 --> 27:15.974
Nice save, huh?

27:16.008 --> 27:17.542
Actually, it was
mostly my idea.

27:17.576 --> 27:19.277
No way.
Sorry?

27:19.311 --> 27:20.746
No way.
It's too dangerous.

27:20.780 --> 27:21.980
I'm not gonna let you do it.

27:22.014 --> 27:23.882
But it's the only way

27:23.916 --> 27:25.117
you can bring
down your father

27:25.151 --> 27:26.551
and save Vincent
before he kills him.

27:26.585 --> 27:29.220
Yeah, and risk losing you
in the process?

27:29.255 --> 27:31.922
If my father figures out
why you're really doing this,

27:31.957 --> 27:33.391
he will kill you.
Catherine...

27:33.425 --> 27:35.159
I have been trying
to save Vincent

27:35.193 --> 27:37.262
since the day you saved me,
and this is the way,

27:37.296 --> 27:38.496
I'm convinced of it.

27:38.530 --> 27:40.097
I need to do this,
I want to.

27:40.132 --> 27:42.933
For Vincent...

27:42.968 --> 27:44.135
and for you.

28:10.126 --> 28:11.960
We're on.

28:20.794 --> 28:22.349
JT's and Tess
are almost done

28:22.350 --> 28:24.218
loading my evidence into
the car, including Zach.

28:24.252 --> 28:25.886
I still don't feel good
about this, Gabe.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.520
My father's not stupid.

28:27.555 --> 28:28.689
What if he checks the evidence?
He won't.

28:28.723 --> 28:29.956
He'll be too
shocked to see

28:29.991 --> 28:31.224
that I'm the one
blackmailing him.

28:31.258 --> 28:32.659
As long as he
still thinks

28:32.694 --> 28:34.561
I have the Bombmaker
in custody, I'm good.

28:34.595 --> 28:36.730
If he doesn't,
you're dead.

28:36.764 --> 28:38.531
We've already gone
through this, Catherine.

28:38.566 --> 28:39.966
Okay, at least let Tess...

28:40.001 --> 28:41.467
No.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.469
You already said that
your father isn't stupid.

28:43.504 --> 28:44.804
He'll be checking for backup
and if he sees it,

28:44.838 --> 28:46.906
I  <i>will</i> be dead.
It's bad enough

28:46.940 --> 28:48.741
that you'll be nearby,
but it's our only chance

28:48.775 --> 28:50.855
to record him, because he will
be looking for a wire.

28:50.877 --> 28:52.912
I don't know.

28:52.946 --> 28:55.582
It's just all been
such a roller coaster.

28:55.616 --> 28:58.984
I can't believe it's finally coming
down to this.

29:00.887 --> 29:02.755
I don't know how
to thank you.

29:02.789 --> 29:04.389
Don't thank me,

29:04.424 --> 29:06.959
till he's in jail.

29:14.567 --> 29:16.635
It's my father.

29:18.304 --> 29:20.339
Why's he calling?

29:21.974 --> 29:23.675
He can't be
onto us, can he?

29:23.710 --> 29:25.510
Answer it.

29:26.613 --> 29:28.313
Hello?

29:32.417 --> 29:33.618
Hey.

29:33.652 --> 29:35.053
Hi.

29:37.623 --> 29:39.457
Th-Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

29:39.491 --> 29:40.925
No, is everything
all right?

29:40.960 --> 29:44.395
Uh... you said on the phone
that it was important.

29:44.429 --> 29:45.730
Right. Sorry.

29:45.765 --> 29:46.865
I'm just a bit
crazed right now.

29:46.899 --> 29:48.099
A lot going on
all of a sudden.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.468
Uh, yeah? Like what?

29:50.502 --> 29:53.604
My section chief pushed up
my next assignment,

29:53.639 --> 29:56.407
which means
I have to leave.

29:56.441 --> 29:57.808
When?

29:57.842 --> 29:59.744
Tonight.

29:59.778 --> 30:01.279
I'll be gone for a while,
I'm afraid,

30:01.313 --> 30:02.713
which is why I wanted
to meet with you.

30:02.748 --> 30:03.948
I wanted to tell
you in person.

30:03.982 --> 30:06.250
I wanted
to say...

30:06.284 --> 30:08.551
good-bye.

30:11.089 --> 30:13.824
Wow. Um...

30:13.858 --> 30:15.592
I don't know
what to say.

30:15.626 --> 30:18.162
Well, believe me, uh...

30:18.196 --> 30:19.596
I'm as disappointed
as you are.

30:19.630 --> 30:21.931
I doubt it.

30:23.668 --> 30:27.304
No, I, uh...
I just mean that,

30:27.338 --> 30:29.406
we were just starting
to get to know each other.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.641
I was really hoping

30:31.676 --> 30:33.910
that things would
turn out differently.

30:33.944 --> 30:36.613
Me, too.

30:37.948 --> 30:39.148
Look...

30:39.183 --> 30:41.083
I am sorry
I couldn't

30:41.118 --> 30:42.451
help more
with Vincent.

30:42.485 --> 30:45.988
No, it's okay,
I understand.

30:46.023 --> 30:48.324
I will find the guy
who did this.

30:52.296 --> 30:54.297
I'm sure you will.

30:59.902 --> 31:01.169
I better go.

31:01.204 --> 31:03.539
Good luck.

31:03.573 --> 31:05.474
You, too.

31:25.527 --> 31:26.794
Showtime.

31:35.003 --> 31:36.337
Come on, Gabriel.

31:51.019 --> 31:53.020
You!

31:53.054 --> 31:55.422
Whoa, easy, Bob.
I don't think you want

31:55.456 --> 31:57.724
to be shooting me right now,
unless you want to spend

31:57.759 --> 31:58.759
the rest of your life in prison.

31:58.793 --> 31:59.894
Where is he?

31:59.928 --> 32:01.862
Wilkes? Your bomb maker?

32:01.896 --> 32:03.830
He's safely
sequestered somewhere

32:03.865 --> 32:05.699
until he gets
his half of the money.

32:05.733 --> 32:08.001
Chatty guy, too,
can't shut him up.

32:08.035 --> 32:10.404
He's not a big fan
of yours, obviously.

32:10.438 --> 32:11.605
How do I know
you really have him?

32:11.639 --> 32:13.306
Didn't you get his text?

32:15.376 --> 32:17.676
You think I'm stupid
enough to wear a wire?

32:17.711 --> 32:18.677
Where's the money?

32:18.712 --> 32:19.913
Pop the trunk.

32:19.947 --> 32:21.614
Pop the trunk!

32:35.261 --> 32:38.263
You know, at first I just
wanted to bust your ass,

32:38.298 --> 32:39.865
but then I remembered
how you tried to kill me

32:39.900 --> 32:41.700
when I was a beast, and I
thought, you know what?

32:41.735 --> 32:43.903
I want more than justice.
I want money.

32:43.937 --> 32:46.204
Enough to help me
disappear.

32:46.239 --> 32:48.541
Well, that's everything
I got on you,

32:48.575 --> 32:50.075
my whole case...

32:50.109 --> 32:51.643
except for Wilkes, of course.

32:51.677 --> 32:54.046
Who is more than willing
to throw you under the bus,

32:54.080 --> 32:56.248
tell the cops who ordered
all those hits

32:56.282 --> 32:57.715
if you don't pay.

32:57.750 --> 32:58.951
Beast hits?

32:58.985 --> 32:59.985
Vincent Keller,

33:00.019 --> 33:02.754
Tori Windsor, Zachary Hayes.

33:02.788 --> 33:04.923
The cops don't know
they were beasts,

33:04.958 --> 33:06.958
they just know
that they were assassinated.

33:06.992 --> 33:08.726
And conspiracy
to commit murder's

33:08.761 --> 33:10.394
a pretty big-time charge.

33:24.142 --> 33:25.742
You're bluffing.

33:25.777 --> 33:27.244
Your call.

33:31.316 --> 33:34.151
I should never have taken you
off of my list.

33:34.186 --> 33:36.187
I should've had you killed, too.

33:36.221 --> 33:38.289
Gotcha.

33:38.323 --> 33:40.290
Take my car,
the money's inside.

33:40.324 --> 33:41.592
Sorry?

33:41.626 --> 33:43.126
We're switching cars.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.828
I'm not loading all this crap
into my car,

33:44.863 --> 33:46.530
not here. Not now.

33:46.564 --> 33:48.632
What's the matter, Lowan,
don't you trust me?

33:48.666 --> 33:51.368
If anything happens to me...

33:51.402 --> 33:53.303
Relax, I'm not stupid, either.

33:53.337 --> 33:55.138
Besides, I just got back
with my daughter.

33:55.172 --> 33:56.939
You think I want to ruin that?

34:12.023 --> 34:14.724
Don't worry,
I'm not getting in that car.

34:14.757 --> 34:16.225
I'll wait for the bomb squad.

34:16.259 --> 34:17.426
You go arrest that jerk.

34:26.335 --> 34:28.737
Hands up!

34:28.771 --> 34:29.771
Now!

34:33.909 --> 34:35.876
<i>Let me explain.</i>
<i>Shut up.</i>

34:35.911 --> 34:37.210
But I need to...

34:37.246 --> 34:38.913
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:38.947 --> 34:40.481
Anything you say can...

34:40.516 --> 34:42.183
Catherine, please!
I never wanted to hurt you.

34:42.217 --> 34:44.152
I tried everything
to keep it from you,

34:44.186 --> 34:47.388
to spare you from this, but I should've
known that was impossible.

34:47.422 --> 34:48.856
But you have
to understand,

34:48.889 --> 34:50.558
I had to do it.

34:50.592 --> 34:54.428
I had to kill all the beasts
to make amends for helping

34:54.462 --> 34:55.996
make them in the first place.

34:56.031 --> 34:57.998
I made a mistake,
I had to correct it.

34:58.033 --> 34:59.867
By killing Vincent?
Yes, especially Vincent.

34:59.901 --> 35:03.837
They only get worse, Catherine,
you know it, you've seen it.

35:03.872 --> 35:05.806
It was the only way
I could protect...

35:08.809 --> 35:10.910
Watch out! Watch out!

35:34.434 --> 35:35.735
Catherine?

35:40.009 --> 35:42.744
Catherine?!

35:59.201 --> 36:01.202
How are you still alive?

36:01.236 --> 36:03.905
You used me.

36:03.939 --> 36:06.006
You did this to me!

36:08.543 --> 36:12.012
I did it to stop the others.
To stop what Muirfield did.

36:12.046 --> 36:13.147
You did this!

36:24.626 --> 36:26.392
And I would do it again

36:26.427 --> 36:28.895
to save my daughter
from a beast like you.

36:33.067 --> 36:34.434
You failed.

36:35.837 --> 36:37.437
Let him go.

36:40.007 --> 36:42.742
I can't let you do this.

36:42.776 --> 36:46.045
Vincent, we've got him--
it's over.

36:46.079 --> 36:50.716
It'll never be over
as long as he's alive.

36:50.751 --> 36:53.085
Oh, he's going to jail,
I promise.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.920
He'll get out.

36:54.955 --> 36:57.056
You can't stop him,

36:57.090 --> 36:58.290
but I can.

36:58.324 --> 37:00.325
Please...

37:00.360 --> 37:01.694
please, don't!

37:03.496 --> 37:05.597
I am begging you!

37:09.136 --> 37:10.970
You still have
a choice.

37:11.004 --> 37:17.643
You can choose to walk away
and save yourself...

37:17.677 --> 37:19.911
save us.

37:19.945 --> 37:22.314
Please don't make everything
that we've been through,

37:22.348 --> 37:24.883
everything that we've meant
to each other be for nothing.

37:28.220 --> 37:30.121
Don't do this.

38:31.716 --> 38:33.983
