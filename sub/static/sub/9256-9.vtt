00:02.120 --> 00:03.640
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.840 --> 00:07.120
That's my book. Matthew has autism.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.280
Oh, Jesus.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.920
This is a brotherhood.
Everybody knows that but you.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.080
You gotta decide if you wanna stay
partners. If you do, open up.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.760
If you don't, talk to Aceveda.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.640
He already turned me down
when I asked for a new partner.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.240
Maybe he'll listen to you.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.520
My husband was murdered.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.720
This one's been hanging on the vine
for a year, man. She is ripe.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.840
Handing in this arrest report's the only
way to stop you from making a mistake.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.440
- That report doesn't prove anything.
- I don't have to prove you're gay.

00:38.640 --> 00:43.480
In this house, all I gotta do is say it,
with all the gory details.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.680
- I'm not sure they stole any drugs.
- What?

00:46.840 --> 00:49.920
It was dark. They were at the other end.
My view was obstructed.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.520
- Mackey got to you.
- No.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.520
- He threatened you.
- He didn't.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.840
Might not feel like it, but you did
the right thing yesterday.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.400
You were there for me.
I'm there for you.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.440
I said, stay down!

01:28.880 --> 01:31.640
I said, shut up!

01:36.200 --> 01:37.320
- Stop!
- Shut up!

01:37.480 --> 01:39.480
- Please!
- Shut up!

01:42.920 --> 01:46.320
Don't look so bad to me, huh?
You gonna follow us, bitch?

01:46.520 --> 01:47.880
- You gonna follow us?
- No.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.400
I didn't think so, Ã©se.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.680
See you later, homes.
Don't be a loser...

01:59.040 --> 02:00.760
Have a puff on me, homes.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.040
So how many were there?

02:04.200 --> 02:08.960
Three. They wore
bandannas and masks.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.040
- I can tell they were beaners.
- How?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.840
By the way they talked,
Spanish tattoos.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.040
Describe one.

02:17.200 --> 02:23.280
I saw a serpent with wings
and the other one was just L-M.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.200
It's Los Mags. We better call Vic.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.680
- Matthew, what's this?
- A girl.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.000
How does she feel?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.360
Can't you tell?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.640
Hungry?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.320
Maybe Daddy can help.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.640
Daddy's hungry too.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.840
Maybe she's hungry. What else is she?

02:47.000 --> 02:52.840
- Happy?
- Yes. She's happy.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.400
And this girl? How does she feel?

02:56.600 --> 02:58.720
Happy.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.880
It's work.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.120
Today's your day off.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.280
Hey.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.120
Yeah.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.720
All right, I'll come in.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.120
There's been another truck jacking.

03:22.280 --> 03:28.080
I need a break. I'm sick. I haven't slept
more than two hours all week long.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.960
- I know.
- Shane gets three days off...

03:30.120 --> 03:33.640
...to go play in Vegas.
- Shane's not in charge. I am.

03:33.840 --> 03:39.000
The new babysitter starts tomorrow.
Things'll get a lot easier for you then.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.920
When will you be home?

03:42.080 --> 03:44.600
As soon as I can.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.440
Oh! Cesar, tear yourself away,
will you?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.200
- One sec.
- Yeah.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.640
Newlyweds, giving each other matching
genital rings as wedding gifts.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.720
- It's a beautiful thing.
- I'll take your word for it.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.240
Check this out. Any idea who
that tattoo belongs to?

04:24.400 --> 04:26.280
Not my work. Lacks the detail.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.760
Belongs to a Los Mag.
Gotta be a local.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.680
I'll make a couple of calls,
see what I can dig up for you.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.800
Oh, cholo rising.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.200
Latino, 20s.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.280
- And there's the girlfriend.
- Thank you, Cesar.

04:49.600 --> 04:54.080
- Hector Estanza. Let's rock.
- Let's do it.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.120
I told you not to mess with...

05:01.280 --> 05:03.400
What am I gonna do?
He was banging on the door.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.120
I don't give a shit.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.440
- Don't be so stupid.
- Leave me alone. Get out.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.840
This guy likes to hurt people,
so be ready.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.600
- Stupid ass.
- Go!

05:11.800 --> 05:13.680
- Freeze! Police!
- What are you doing?

05:13.840 --> 05:17.200
On the floor! On the floor, now!

05:17.480 --> 05:18.960
Stop!

05:19.120 --> 05:20.600
Freeze! Freeze!

05:20.800 --> 05:23.200
- Okay, okay!
- Lem! Lem!

05:23.680 --> 05:25.920
He's got a gun!

05:26.120 --> 05:29.960
Oh, my God. Oh, shit!
I thought it was a gun.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.960
- Check and see if he's got one.
- Vic?

05:32.120 --> 05:34.440
We got him! Stay inside the house!

05:34.600 --> 05:37.840
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Damn! What do we do?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.640
- Just when we got clear.
- I shot an unarmed guy.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.720
All right. He's the jacker.
We'll figure out what to say.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.880
Right. He threatened us with a carton
of cigarettes, so I shot him?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.320
Hey, just let me think!

05:49.800 --> 05:54.120
Six Paul 11, shots fired,
2728 Verbena Ave.

05:54.280 --> 05:58.680
Suspect is down. Requesting backup
and an ambulance.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.240
- Oh, man, Vic.
- I know, I know.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.280
I don't like it any more than you do.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.760
But we can't afford to take
another hit right now.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.560
You saw what he did to the trucker.

06:20.720 --> 06:24.040
- Yeah. I know. I know.
- All right. Come on.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.800
Vic?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.120
Wanna tell me what happened?

06:29.280 --> 06:32.520
We got a sketch off the jacking victim.
He was a Los Mag banger.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.720
ICI turned me on to Hector Estanza.
We sit on the girl he lives with...

06:36.880 --> 06:38.720
Hector shows up, we go in,
Hector runs.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.840
The guy turns on me. He had me dead
to rights. Lem saved my ass.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.120
- As righteous as a shoot gets.
- Chaco! Oh, my God! Chaco!

06:47.280 --> 06:50.040
What did you do? Chaco.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.880
Don't worry. Your boyfriend's
gonna make it.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.600
Boyfriend? That's my brother, Chaco.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.280
You shot the wrong guy?

07:13.560 --> 07:13.680
We shot Hector's girlfriend's brother.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.320
We shot Hector's girlfriend's brother.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.640
He had a carton of stolen cancer sticks
on him and a gun pointed right at me.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.200
- So he's the right guy.
- He and Hector are Los Mags.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.840
They're probably in the same crew.
We'll get Hector.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.920
- Is the girl involved?
- Not that I know of.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.160
Lem's at the hospital getting her
statement. Boyfriend beat her up.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.920
- Maybe she'll roll on him.
- Here's hoping.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.600
Officer Lowe.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.600
Taking back your IAD statement
hurt me. It hurt me bad.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.000
It let Mackey off the hook.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.320
There's clearly misconduct here.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.240
Give me one good reason
why I should let you off the hook.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.520
All my life I wanted to be
a police officer.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.640
I grew up in this neighbourhood.
I wanna make a difference here.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.400
You could've made that difference
by taking down Vic Mackey.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.840
I knew I got in over my head
when I first made those charges.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.320
I'm worried you've made
some pact with Mackey.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.720
No, sir. I've got nothing
to do with him.

08:09.880 --> 08:15.200
I just want a fresh start, to be
a good cop. I'll prove it to you.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.800
You'll receive an official reprimand.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.200
I'll dock a week's pay
and put you on probation.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.680
I'll decide in a month whether
or not to keep you on.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.960
Thank you.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.679
Captain, a new training officer
might help me with that fresh start.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.120
You don't get to choose
who you partner with.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.080
Neither does Officer Sofer.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.039
Miss Orozco?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.120
Tigre.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.320
- I'm Curtis.
- What do you want?

08:50.480 --> 08:52.480
Can we talk about Los Mags
and your brother?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.360
My brother jumped Los Mags
three years ago. He's out.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.360
Well, he didn't look out last night.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.240
He was protecting me from the same
guy you were looking for, Hector.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.040
So Hector beat you up?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.280
He didn't like me breaking up with him.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.720
Well, you ever think
about pressing charges?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.640
Yeah, like you guys can protect me.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.280
Chaco was taking care of me
until your guy shot him...

09:12.440 --> 09:14.800
...and he don't even bang no more.
- You're sure?

09:14.960 --> 09:19.000
You don't wanna believe me,
ask around.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.120
We decided we better cut him loose.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.640
Coyotes?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.640
This time of year, rabbits and
squirrels burrow underground.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.800
Coyotes get hungry, can't find food,
they come down to forage.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.800
- Thank you, Ranger Rick.
- My grandpa had a farm.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.480
Over here.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.640
- It's about time.
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.720
His name is Maynard Hawkins.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.480
Maynard, I'm Detective Wyms.
This is Detective Wagenbach.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.240
Were you chained up all night?

09:55.440 --> 09:57.000
I don't wanna be in no trouble.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.880
You're not the one who's in trouble.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.920
He's got some pretty serious bites.
Where are the paramedics?

10:02.120 --> 10:06.400
- I'll go call them this time.
- For God's sakes, cut him loose.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.800
Leave me alone. I'm fine.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.960
He's blind.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.280
- Hey, what's going on?
- Who're you?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.520
I'm Lloyd. That's my dad.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.280
Lloyd, your father's been attacked
by coyotes.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.840
Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry, Pop.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
- I can explain.
- Save it for the station!

10:43.800 --> 10:47.440
Daddy. What are you doing here?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.720
- Came to see you.
- What's wrong?

10:49.880 --> 10:52.280
I just needed a good place to read.

10:52.680 --> 10:57.040
Well, I can't talk right now.
I've got a case and...

10:57.200 --> 10:58.840
Dutch, my father, Bryce.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.840
Professor Wyms,
glad to finally meet you.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.520
It's my pleasure.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.720
- Go ahead. I'll wait.
- It could be hours.

11:06.880 --> 11:12.120
I'm only on page 23, and I imagine
this is a fascinating place.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.520
- It is.
- Actually, it's not.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.920
- Why don't you be the judge.
- All right.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.600
I don't understand why I'm here.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.440
<i>-You're in trouble.
- For what?</i>

11:21.600 --> 11:24.440
Shouldn't you be in there
for point-counterpoint?

11:24.600 --> 11:28.520
There is no counterpoint. He's guilty.
It's down to a matter of degree.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.160
<i>-We're charging you for eIderly abuse.
- What?</i>

11:31.320 --> 11:33.240
So it's the subtle fractions
of culpability...

11:33.400 --> 11:36.480
...that conspire to determine
that man's fate?

11:36.800 --> 11:38.680
I like the way you talk.

11:38.880 --> 11:43.640
You had your father tied up outside
like an animal without proper shelter.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.320
- I can explain that.
- I'm listening.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.680
- I'm divorced.
- Surprise me some more.

11:51.280 --> 11:55.120
I pay alimony and child support,
and I fell behind.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.840
State garnishes my wages.
And I missed some payments...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.320
...to the nursing home,
and they kicked my pop out.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.880
Did you try to place him
in another home?

12:05.680 --> 12:07.880
It cost too much.
I'm barely scraping by as is.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.600
What about his benefits?

12:11.200 --> 12:14.240
After food and 50 bucks a month
to keep him in Depends...

12:14.400 --> 12:19.200
...there ain't nothing left.
- So you leave him outside, chained up?

12:21.080 --> 12:23.240
He's blind. He wanders.

12:23.440 --> 12:26.440
- Where's your mother?
- Ran off and left me to take care of him.

12:26.600 --> 12:32.080
I'm telling you, it is the system
that is screwing him over, not me.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.800
That's so you don't wander.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.040
Hey, Brian, thanks for the drop-by.

12:40.240 --> 12:43.240
Travis, what a shock to see you
back here again.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.680
It's like going to a family reunion.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.640
I wanted to ask about
one of your parolees.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.560
Which one? I've only got about 300.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.000
- Well, he's a Los Mag.
- That narrows it down to about 30.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.120
- His name's Chaco Orozco.
- Oh, yeah, Chaco.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.440
That was quick.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.920
That's because I remember
the good ones by name.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.360
So he's a good guy?

13:03.560 --> 13:06.600
Well, let's put it this way,
I wish they could all be like him.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.920
He's not in any kind of trouble, is he?

13:10.120 --> 13:12.520
- No, I think we made a big mistake.
- Why?

13:12.680 --> 13:15.520
I talked to his parole officer
and his Clean Slate counsellor.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.760
- Clean Slate?
- It's the program for bangers...

13:17.920 --> 13:19.840
...who want out.
What'd his counsellor say?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.920
In three years
he's never missed a meeting.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.360
He counsels young bangers
on how to get out.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.480
It doesn't mean he didn't get back in.
Let's not forget he ran.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.560
His sister says he didn't wanna get
caught with Hector's smokes.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.640
- Lf his sister says he's clean...
- What about his gang tats?

13:33.800 --> 13:35.640
Tigre says he's getting them
lasered off.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.720
Wait a minute. His sister has
a name now?

13:38.880 --> 13:42.800
Can we just talk to Chaco,
hear his side of things?

13:46.080 --> 13:49.080
I hope to hell you're wrong, man.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.160
- You want me to pass it on to the DA?
- Not yet.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.840
I'll go to the hospital to get
answers from the father.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.640
Come on, I'll walk you out.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.320
- Rebecca wants you to meet Warner.
- I don't want to.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.040
- He's her fiancÃ©.
- She has a husband.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.240
They come 3000 miles from Boston,
and you won't see your daughter?

14:05.400 --> 14:09.080
I'm dying to see Rebecca, but I don't
think it's fair I have to meet him...

14:09.240 --> 14:11.520
...when we should be
trying to save her marriage.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.920
She won't leave Warner
alone in a hotel room.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.320
- Well, there you go.
- Don't be so hard, Peaches.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.560
I'm not.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.680
Rebecca's been married to Gordon
11 months, and she's giving up?

14:20.840 --> 14:25.000
- Do you think she really tried?
- She's a big girl now.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.520
Where'd you park?

14:26.720 --> 14:29.520
Rebecca and Warner dropped me off
on their way to the Getty.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.920
- I'll give you a ride back.
- I'm staying a while.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.200
Dutch has offered to show me around.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.520
The only thing I'm guilty for is
trying to protect Tigre.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.600
- Why'd you run?
- Stolen cigs, Los Mag tats.

14:42.760 --> 14:46.040
- I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- You were right.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.240
Not to mention, planting that gun.
That's my third strike.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.240
- They planted the gun on you?
- No way.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.640
Next time check your pockets
before leaving the house.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.200
- Why don't we get to what matters?
- What's that?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.520
How will you protect her?

15:01.080 --> 15:04.760
Hector finds out the cops got his
cigarettes, he'll think she called it in.

15:05.480 --> 15:09.280
Hector's gonna wanna do
a lot worse than beat her.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.040
Where does Hector keep his stolen
merch? Who's in your crew?

15:13.240 --> 15:17.160
I don't live that life anymore.
Now, she needs protection.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.080
She'll get it.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.520
That must've hurt like a mother,
getting that thing lasered off.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.880
Yeah. Worse than getting shot.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.440
This isn't good. I believe him.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.320
- Me too.
- Christ, man, I knew it.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.040
Third strike, and all he cares about
is his sister.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.520
- We set up the wrong guy.
- What if I'd killed him?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.000
- You didn't.
- But I could've.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.440
- Oh, man.
- What did I do?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.920
Okay, what do we do now?

15:50.080 --> 15:52.280
I don't know.

15:55.960 --> 15:56.120
- Yo, we gotta clear this guy.
- Nobody's arguing.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.240
- Yo, we gotta clear this guy.
- Nobody's arguing.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.840
Well, how do we make
the gun charge just disappear?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.080
We make the gun disappear.
Sneak into the evidence room.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.240
That place is like
Grand Central Station.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.520
During the day. We'll hit it tonight.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.280
For now, we get the right guy.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.520
Find Hector, sit on him and be there
when he moves on his next job.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.360
Well, what if his next job's Tigre?

16:18.560 --> 16:22.000
Lem, you babysit Tigre. Ronnie,
you're on Hector patrol with me.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.880
We made this mess,
we're gonna clean it up.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.000
Hang on a second.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.840
- Hello?
- Where are you?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.680
You've been gone since yesterday.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.760
Yeah. I'm still working on this.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.520
Matthew has been calling for you
since this morning. He needs you here.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
- I know.
- I thought you made an arrest.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.080
- There's more.
- I need a prescription from Rite Aid.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.720
- Well, is the babysitter there?
- Yes.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.120
Well, go.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.120
I'd have to leave her with the kids.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.120
We hired a babysitter you don't trust
with the kids?

16:57.280 --> 16:59.360
When are you coming home?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.080
<i>Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!</i>

17:03.000 --> 17:06.920
Hey. How do you think the Dodgers
are gonna do this year?

17:07.079 --> 17:08.280
I don't follow baseball.

17:08.480 --> 17:12.400
Would it be profiling if I said
I bet you follow basketball?

17:13.319 --> 17:15.400
Actually, I heard you were
a Clippers fan.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.319
- Yeah.
- Two tickets.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.960
Floor seats. I can't make it.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.880
We gotta roll.

17:24.040 --> 17:28.119
I'm putting together a softball team to
take on those beach cops in Venice.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.320
I'm pencilling you in. Centre fielder.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.120
Talk to you later.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.760
- You're here.
- As promised.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.880
- Nice bike.
- Thanks.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.680
- Hope you chained it.
- You ride?

17:50.880 --> 17:53.680
- Because I'm a gang chick?
- Just wanted to know if you rode.

17:54.280 --> 17:58.480
- So how's this work?
- I keep you safe until we arrest Hector.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.640
What do you think you're doing?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.480
Hey!

18:18.400 --> 18:20.920
- I think I got it covered.
- You think?

18:21.600 --> 18:25.680
Yeah. Ain't nobody getting past me.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.720
I see they've got you
in the ambassador suite.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.680
- Who's that?
- Detective Wyms, Maynard.

18:33.840 --> 18:38.040
Social Services already told me
they're taking me away.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.840
I just wanted to know what happened
to your wife.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.240
Mona.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.800
Ran away.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.600
How long ago?

18:49.800 --> 18:53.120
Five, six years, maybe.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.680
No note, no message, no goodbye.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.240
No.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.720
How do you know she ran away?

19:03.880 --> 19:06.480
Lloyd told me.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.000
What else did Lloyd tell you?

19:10.480 --> 19:13.440
- So, what kind of work do you do?
- I'm a stylist.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.840
- Hair?
- Yeah.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.600
- So you could do my hair?
- Yeah.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.040
Cut it off and start over.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.240
It's not that bad, is it?

19:24.400 --> 19:27.040
- I could do some things.
- Yeah, maybe after we get Hector.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.520
Yeah. Maybe.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.480
You know, you could help. Tell me
where Hector's next job's gonna be.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.160
- I don't know.
- I believe your brother.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.680
You, I'm not so sure.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.080
- Why?
- He's not afraid of Hector, and you are.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.280
Hector's scary.

19:42.440 --> 19:47.280
I deal with shit like Hector every day.
He's not as scary as you think.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.080
He says I'm his.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.920
Oh, man, this is fresh.
When did he do that?

20:00.080 --> 20:04.880
Last night, when I didn't wanna let
him in with his stolen smokes.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.120
Looks like they're scoping out
their next job.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.640
You know, Lem's feeling pretty down.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.400
Better than letting
some asshole shoot me.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.880
Oh, what the hell is this?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.360
Lem!

20:41.400 --> 20:44.480
- Hey, yo, you Hector?
- Who are you, homes?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.080
Check out this vato...

20:50.600 --> 20:52.320
Come on.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.400
You like that, huh?

20:58.200 --> 21:00.840
Police! Police! Hey, give me
some pavement!

21:01.000 --> 21:03.280
Give me some pavement!

21:05.360 --> 21:08.760
That's for Tigre, asshole.
Stay away from her!

21:08.960 --> 21:10.360
- Lem!
- No, man, he branded her!

21:10.560 --> 21:13.160
You mess with me and Tigre,
and you're dead too, homes.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.640
Oh, you think
I'm scared of you, pussy?

21:15.920 --> 21:19.440
Goddamn it! Back off, back off!

21:19.600 --> 21:22.040
That's right, bitch ass.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.640
- Goddamn it, man.
- Bitch!

21:25.840 --> 21:28.480
You should've seen what he did
to her. He needed a lesson.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.480
They were getting ready to roll
on a job.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.640
Fifteen to 20 would've been
a great lesson.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.840
Sure was a nice ass-whupping, though.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.320
Hey, that's not the point. Our mission
was to catch Hector red-handed...

21:38.480 --> 21:41.520
...bring him in, break him, lock him up
and stop the jackings.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.720
Well, what about getting Chaco off?
When are we getting that gun?

21:44.880 --> 21:51.000
I said, tonight. Now, are you protecting
the sister or just getting in my way?

21:57.680 --> 22:00.840
- You're back.
- I learned some interesting things.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.240
So did I.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.640
You were a classical dancer
when you were a teenager?

22:06.800 --> 22:09.320
Okay. My father is now off-limits
to you. Where is he?

22:09.480 --> 22:12.400
- How could you not share that?
- I only studied nine months.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.200
- In Paris.
- Do your thing...

22:14.360 --> 22:17.280
...and stop stalking me.
- It's only stalking if you work at it.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.960
Your father just opened right up.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.960
- What exactly is my thing?
- Dig.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.040
- On the elderly abuse case?
- How about elderly murder?

22:26.200 --> 22:28.800
The son's cashing in the mother's
Social Security checks.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.840
She's nowhere to be found.
If he treats his father like this...

22:32.040 --> 22:34.800
...who knows what he did to the mom.
- Interesting.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.600
Maynard's got five other kids.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.120
I'll make some calls.
One must know something.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.120
I'll search the database
and see if I can sniff a trail.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.520
Oh, and your daughter and her fiancÃ©'ll
be here in a half an hour.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.840
What?

22:47.880 --> 22:49.320
Come in.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.560
- You wanted to see me.
- Yes, Danny.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.520
So Julien asked you
about reassignment?

22:53.680 --> 22:56.040
I wanted to talk to you
about a different matter.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.840
What's that?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.640
I have a friend in Administration.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.400
I asked to see the early results
of the sergeant's exam.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.280
Yeah?

23:05.480 --> 23:09.480
You missed the cutoff, Danny,
by three points.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.200
- You mean I failed?
- Three points is nothing.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.720
Oh, goddamn it. I worked hard.

23:17.880 --> 23:22.000
I studied with Dutch.
I even got a good night's sleep.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.360
- Lf I didn't pass this time...
- You'll pass next time.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.520
- You expect me to take it again?
- Yeah.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.480
And I expect you to pass it.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.000
David, send someone over to...

23:35.160 --> 23:37.040
Who was the criminologist that night?

23:37.200 --> 23:38.560
- You write that down?
- I did.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.920
I'm not sure. Check the book.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.400
Goddamn it.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.440
I used to do this for Chaco
when he was banging.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.040
- It feels good.
- Does it?

24:00.240 --> 24:02.200
Yeah.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.520
- I wish I could've been there.
- I wish I could've done more.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.560
You know, Hector needs to be
locked up, not Chaco.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.200
- And what're you doing about that?
- You gotta have faith in me.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.800
We'll see.

24:20.800 --> 24:24.360
Tigre, there's something
that I have to tell you.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.400
Yeah? What's that?

24:29.040 --> 24:30.520
What?

24:30.680 --> 24:33.080
I shot your brother.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.520
- It wasn't the other guy?
- I thought he'd kill my boss.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.480
- Are you the one that planted the gun?
- Nobody planted a gun.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.800
- I don't want you here.
- You need someone here.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.840
- Hector will kill you.
- I don't wanna see your face!

24:46.000 --> 24:48.640
You shot Chaco. What's to stop me
from shooting you?

24:48.840 --> 24:50.160
- Nothing.
- You shoot Chaco...

24:50.360 --> 24:52.400
...then try to get in my pants
for laughs?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.520
That's not... Look, I made a mistake.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.680
We're gonna get Chaco off.
I promise you.

25:04.680 --> 25:09.360
Come on! Come on! Come on!
I'm right here, assholes!

25:11.240 --> 25:13.520
Punk ass!

25:17.680 --> 25:19.440
- Hey, Cacuzza.
- Hey.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.040
I need some help.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.200
What's up?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.840
- You live in the Valley, right?
- Yeah. You thinking of moving?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.520
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.320
You wanna be nearer to me, huh?

25:30.480 --> 25:32.920
Who wouldn't? Any suggestions?

25:33.080 --> 25:36.160
Yeah, West Hills, where I live, is nice.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.320
I think there's a West Hills
for rent on the bulletin board.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.240
- Can you take a look?
- Yeah.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.000
- Thanks.
- Oh, let me just lock up real quick.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.360
Hey, Cacuzza, sleeping
on the job again?

25:46.520 --> 25:47.840
I'm right here.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.040
I know Ronnie was looking for you.
I see you found him.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.720
You aren't trying to pull
one of your pranks on me?

25:55.920 --> 25:58.040
No, no, I really wanna move.

25:58.200 --> 26:03.600
Right. And a man's just as good as
a vibrator. What are you guys up to?

26:04.680 --> 26:06.320
Nothing.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.200
Okay. But I'm watching you two.

26:22.240 --> 26:26.000
Excuse me, this is your father
we're talking about.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.120
Thank you very much
for your time, then.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.720
Every one of Maynard's kids
hopes he rots in hell.

26:31.880 --> 26:35.040
- Have no clue where the mother is.
- I ran the wife's maiden name.

26:35.200 --> 26:40.600
Got some hits in Virginia. It's East
Coast time. I'll call in the morning.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.640
- Mom?
- Oh, sweetheart.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.840
Hello.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.920
- Mom, this is Warner.
- How you do, Warner?

26:50.080 --> 26:52.520
I've waited a long time
to meet you, Claudette.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.880
- Couldn't have been that long.
- I'm starving. Can we dine?

26:56.200 --> 27:01.280
There's a diner on the corner.
Claudette loves it there.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.800
Well, come on.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.040
So, Warner, how do you like
Los Angeles?

27:16.200 --> 27:17.720
It's big.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.520
How did you meet Rebecca?

27:20.680 --> 27:24.280
Parent-teacher conference.
She taught my 9-year-old.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.480
She's a great teacher.
Both my boys love her.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.320
I see.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.920
- You see what?
- Peaches.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.760
Don't call me that. I'm trying to figure
out if he wants a wife or a babysitter.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.320
You know, maybe I should go
back to the hotel.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.280
No, baby, I'm sorry. Just...
How can you say that?

27:41.440 --> 27:43.880
Don't throw away your future.
Gordon loved you.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.640
- Gordon and I had problems.
- You never gave him a chance.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.320
- Give Warner a chance.
- You knew how I felt.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.040
You think forcing Warner on me
would make a difference?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.840
I thought you'd be open-minded
about getting to know him.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.640
And I thought you'd be open-minded
about trying to save your marriage.

27:58.840 --> 28:02.720
Well, at least everyone
is finally talking.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.800
Come on, let's go to dinner.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.920
- Did you get it?
- No.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.440
Goddamn it.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.840
- Where is the sister?
- She's at a roadside inn. It's safe.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.520
I had to chase off two of Hector's boys.
What are we gonna do about the gun?

28:29.720 --> 28:31.800
I doubt Cacuzza will give us
another chance.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.120
Once that thing hits Central Storage,
that place is like Fort Knox.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.600
- How bad you wanna make this right?
- Why?

28:38.800 --> 28:42.680
You ever wonder how evidence gets
from here to Central Storage?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.240
You're gonna think I'm helpless.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.120
No.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.720
I was planning on making you
a surprise dinner.

28:53.880 --> 28:57.520
Had the blender, the microwave, the TV
going, and the lights went black.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.320
You overloaded the circuit.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.320
- Well, how do I unload it?
- It's easy.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.400
There's a switch in the breaker box.

29:05.680 --> 29:09.320
You have no idea how to do
any of this, do you?

29:09.480 --> 29:13.600
Maybe you trip my switch.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.040
Who's that?

29:36.200 --> 29:38.680
Danny, hi.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.440
- Are you seeing her?
- Kim? Yeah.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.920
It's new, but it seems
to be going fairly well.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.040
- That's great.
- Yeah, so far.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.040
- Dutch, can I see you?
- Oh, excuse me.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.280
Good for you.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.400
What do you got?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.120
You should be feeling pretty good now.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.840
I don't know why.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.720
Hasn't been a little dry lately?

30:04.880 --> 30:08.520
Only in a Death Valley kind of way.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.840
It's good you're dating someone.
Even better, she doesn't work here.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.840
So there you are.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.840
What are you doing here?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.640
He wanted to see
how we match fingerprints.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.040
Shouldn't you be trying to track down
our missing mom?

30:22.200 --> 30:25.040
I found someone with her maiden name
in Virginia Beach.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.480
All I have to do is check
the Social Security number.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.280
- And I'll do that now.
- Thank you.

30:33.280 --> 30:37.680
Rebecca is leaving tomorrow morning.
Have dinner with us tonight.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.400
- And repeat last night's scene?
- I'll referee this time.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.600
There's no fight if I'm not there.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.840
I remember a brilliant scholar
who chose to go into police work...

30:49.000 --> 30:51.240
...against my advice.
- I wasn't brilliant.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.920
- Yes, you were. I was mortified.
- You still are.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.120
No. I've come to understand
your decision.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.960
When I'm your age,
maybe I'll come to understand hers.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.880
Peaches, I'm 30 years older
and smarter than you are.

31:05.080 --> 31:09.280
You're not that much smarter.
Maybe a year or two.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.720
- Hey, Lowe.
- Yeah.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.280
Johnson's having
a little retirement bash next week.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.840
There's room for one more.
You want me to get you in?

31:18.040 --> 31:19.640
- No, thanks.
- Come on.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.280
- You get to meet some of the top brass.
- I'm sorry.

31:22.480 --> 31:26.320
Fine. But if something else comes up,
I'm gonna keep you in the loop.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.880
What do you want?

31:29.280 --> 31:32.720
You looked out for me.
I'm just trying to return the favour.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.680
I've seen the kind of favours you do.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.880
Let's start out on a new page.

31:41.080 --> 31:45.880
You're not my friend,
so stop pretending.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.040
Hello?

31:53.200 --> 31:55.520
- Is this Mona Gaines?
- Yeah.

31:55.720 --> 31:59.440
This is Detective Claudette Wyms.
I'm a detective in Los Angeles.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.720
- What's this about?
- Were you formerly Mona Hawkins?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.120
<i>What do you want?</i>

32:05.280 --> 32:08.840
Are you aware that your son is still
receiving your Social Security checks?

32:09.040 --> 32:12.040
I don't care about that,
so long as they don't contact me.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.840
You know Lloyd's guilty of
abusing Maynard...

32:15.000 --> 32:17.320
...and defrauding
the federal government?

32:17.480 --> 32:20.880
That's not my problem.
Don't call me back.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.480
I guess she wasn't murdered.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.080
One hell of a family.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.320
What do you want?

32:42.480 --> 32:44.400
Hey, you tell Hector
Tigre's mine now.

32:44.600 --> 32:48.160
He's got a problem, he can meet
me at 11:00, L.A. River at Whipple.

32:48.360 --> 32:52.520
I'll kick all three of your asses at the
same time, all right? No cops, just us.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.520
- It's on then, homes.
- All right, bitch.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.360
- Don't tell me you're putting one there.
- I am. What do you need?

33:10.560 --> 33:14.400
Temporary body art, just like the one
I showed you before.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.480
You're all done. Let's do it.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.800
Wash your hands first.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.239
Oh, jeez!

34:18.440 --> 34:20.120
Oh, God.

34:20.679 --> 34:23.679
Please, please, don't hurt me.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.760
- I said the green car.
- You said the blue.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.320
Now I'm saying run the tape
to the green car.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.600
Fine.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.840
What the hell happened here?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.120
The police evidence van was robbed.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.480
Robbed? You gotta be kidding me.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.240
- What'd they take?
- A gun.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.040
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.240
L-M stands for Los MagnÃ­ficos.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.840
Guess what? It was Chaco's gun.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.800
Goddamn it. He just bailed out
his seÃ±orita's brother.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.640
- Hold on. What're you talking about?
- Hector Estanza, Los Mags.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.640
The guy Lem shot, Chaco, who's in
the hospital on that weapons charge.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.480
Without the gun, Chaco will walk.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.960
You get a good look at them?

35:47.120 --> 35:49.320
Just a weird tattoo on the ringleader.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.840
What'd it look like?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.960
A snake with wings on it.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.960
That's Hector. You give us the word,
we'll go pick him up.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.160
Go get him.

36:04.200 --> 36:07.120
Hi. Grandpa said you couldn't
have dinner with us...

36:07.280 --> 36:10.640
...so I wanted to say goodbye.
- I still love you.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.840
- Let's just agree to disagree.
- Fine.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.040
- Where's the ladies' room?
- Right over there.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.200
I'll show you.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.240
This is not your typical police station.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.920
Bryce was telling me a little bit
about its history.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.440
Care for a tour?

36:25.880 --> 36:28.520
And this is one of
our interrogation rooms.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.000
Oh, man.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.040
So this is where you break them.

36:37.200 --> 36:41.040
Suspected rapists, murderers,
child molesters.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.080
We sit them all down right there.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.880
Wanna see how it feels?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Okay.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.360
- Where's Mom and Warner?
- I don't know.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.840
You aware just how smart
my daughter is?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.920
Oh, yeah, she's smart as a whip.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.600
She's smarter than a whip.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.120
That's just an expression.

37:13.280 --> 37:14.680
I do love her, you know.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.200
So it's not just your kids who love her?

37:17.360 --> 37:20.080
If my kids hated her, I'd have trouble
deciding who to keep.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.120
Don't make jokes about giving up
your kids, Warner.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.120
No, ma'am, I didn't mean it like that.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.120
She's a public school teacher now...

37:27.280 --> 37:30.040
...but she's got the potential
to go much further.

37:30.200 --> 37:34.520
She plans on getting her doctorate.
She talked about writing a book.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.640
I want Rebecca to achieve
everything she wants.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.920
You've got all the right answers today.

37:41.080 --> 37:45.240
But marriage is about having
the right answers every day.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.840
I'm watching you, Warner.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.400
Like a hawk, ma'am.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.320
Hit the ground, scumbag!

38:16.480 --> 38:18.640
Freeze, freeze!

38:19.480 --> 38:22.120
- Hands up!
- Turn around, turn around.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.680
Get on your knees.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.520
I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.240
He doesn't put up a fight
unless you wear a dress.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.720
You're the vatos that will
be disappointed, homes.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.280
Yeah? How so?

38:37.480 --> 38:39.480
You let me go for no evidence.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.520
Haven't you heard?

38:41.680 --> 38:44.200
Heard what, Ã©se?

38:45.120 --> 38:47.120
You robbed a police vehicle
today, vato.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.000
Keep dreaming. I was at the L.A. River
waiting for that punk ass to show up.

38:51.200 --> 38:56.600
Man, you must be high.
Oh, look what we got here.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.040
Recently fired.

38:58.200 --> 39:02.080
You better hope that doesn't match
the bullets in that police evidence van.

39:02.280 --> 39:05.520
- It's not mine, homes.
- The van had your gang's tag on it.

39:05.680 --> 39:09.320
The cop identified your tattoo.
Ballistics is gonna come back a match.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.320
You vatos set me up!

39:11.480 --> 39:14.040
Yeah, like a jury's never heard
that one before.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.280
On your knees.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.080
- Get on your knees.
- Get down.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.000
Have a seat.

39:22.480 --> 39:25.360
I saw the two of you bickering
over police tape this afternoon.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.640
- Anything to say?
- He couldn't follow orders.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.480
I'm not a mind reader.
If she said it, I would've done it.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.360
If I separate you, you'll carry
your baggage somewhere else.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.120
I believe in solving problems,
not shuffling them around.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.560
So let's identify the problem. Julien?

39:39.280 --> 39:41.280
- Communication.
- Trust.

39:41.440 --> 39:44.240
Trust comes from communication.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.840
So how are we gonna fix this?
Department workshop?

39:48.000 --> 39:51.840
Or maybe I should set you up with the
city shrink. Any of that sound like fun?

39:52.000 --> 39:54.840
- Not really.
- Nope.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.440
Prove to me that you can watch
each other's backs...

39:57.600 --> 40:00.720
...and then I'll trust that you can watch
another partner's back.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.840
And don't bother me
with this anymore.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.720
So, Dutch, join us.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.920
I've got a feeling he's got
his own date.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.480
- Actually, I do.
- Well, thanks for showing me around.

40:11.640 --> 40:15.520
- Thanks for telling me about Peaches.
- Come on.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.720
So how did it go with Warner?

40:17.880 --> 40:21.080
I didn't have enough to make an arrest.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.600
Hey.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.680
Hon?

40:28.600 --> 40:30.240
How's Matthew today?

40:30.400 --> 40:34.320
He kept asking where you were,
and I didn't know what to tell him.

40:34.480 --> 40:38.440
I'm sorry. How'd it go
with the babysitter?

40:38.600 --> 40:40.840
I fired her.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.720
- Why?
- She just created more work.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.640
I had to explain everything to her...

40:45.800 --> 40:48.320
...and she had no idea how
to handle Matthew.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.640
He needs you. We need you.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.080
What am I supposed to do?
Quit my job?

40:53.280 --> 40:55.720
Wanting us to be a family
doesn't make me a shrew.

40:55.880 --> 41:00.200
- Something important came up.
- Well, something always does.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.200
This isn't working.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.680
- What're you talking about?
- Something has to change.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.920
You'll receive good care
at this place, Maynard.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.520
- Where's Lloyd?
- Oh, he's with us.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.120
You'll be better off.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.640
Maynard, why do your kids
hate you so much?

41:23.800 --> 41:25.600
Here we go.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.880
I was a bastard.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.000
Too late to change my mind
about dinner?

41:50.200 --> 41:53.800
Actually, I made reservations for four.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.240
- They just lost it.
- You expect me to believe...

41:58.400 --> 42:01.640
...Hector made the gun disappear?
- That's what the evidence points to.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.640
- Hector Estanza?
- Yeah.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.200
- So Chaco goes free?
- Yeah.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.640
I have you to thank, don't I?

42:10.800 --> 42:16.480
No, I'm the one who hurt your brother.
I would do anything to take that back.

42:17.480 --> 42:20.800
Yeah, I think I could do something
with this hair.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.720
Look. Tigre, there's something...
We put the gun in Chaco's hands.

42:36.880 --> 42:40.640
We thought it was Hector.
When I found out who...

42:40.800 --> 42:42.640
I know.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.400
You made it right.
