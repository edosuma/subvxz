WEBVTT

00:07.947 --> 00:10.047
All right, class.

00:10.048 --> 00:13.382
Here's one that everyone should
know but few do.

00:13.383 --> 00:16.420
The first capital
of our country was...?

00:17.119 --> 00:19.548
Oh, the chosen few.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:31.046 --> 00:32.433
Mr. Brookwell.

00:33.017 --> 00:34.217
I'm dorry.

00:34.218 --> 00:35.678
I don't know.

00:36.958 --> 00:39.276
I'm dorry you don't know, too.

00:40.648 --> 00:41.719
But I do.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.755
All right.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.273
Mr. Thomas.

00:49.274 --> 00:52.588
You seem to have had time
to chew on this one.

00:54.318 --> 00:58.544
No, "uh" is the capital
of "duh"

00:58.545 --> 01:00.637
which you seem
to be the mayor of.

01:01.982 --> 01:03.458
Hey, just in case
you didn't know

01:03.459 --> 01:04.569
my hand is up over here.

01:04.571 --> 01:05.746
All right,
just letting you know.

01:05.747 --> 01:06.913
All right.

01:07.655 --> 01:10.182
Uh, uh, why don't we let Raven
take this one?

01:10.183 --> 01:11.422
I didn't ask her.

01:11.423 --> 01:13.088
I asked you.

01:14.548 --> 01:17.063
The answer, class,
is Philadelphia.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.687
I hate he only
calls on people

01:22.688 --> 01:24.387
who don't have
their hands raised.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.509
Yeah, and that cracking
sound is nasty.

01:26.510 --> 01:28.677
My grandmother does that
with her toes.

01:29.691 --> 01:30.522
Now

01:30.523 --> 01:31.501
many people attribute

01:31.502 --> 01:33.967
this scientific advance
to Benjamin Franklin

01:33.968 --> 01:37.439
but it was really made
by Michael Faraday.

01:44.248 --> 01:46.029
Ms. Baxter.

01:46.030 --> 01:47.313
But...

01:47.672 --> 01:49.222
I don't have my hand up.

01:49.223 --> 01:50.153
Exactly.

01:51.163 --> 01:52.359
Mr. Petracelli

01:52.360 --> 01:53.726
when my hand is up,
I know the answer

01:53.727 --> 01:55.572
and when my hand is down,
I don't know the answer.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.501
Let me explain it again.

01:56.502 --> 01:57.728
Hand up-- know,
hand down-- don't.

01:57.729 --> 01:58.734
I'm just saying.

01:59.554 --> 02:00.483
No.

02:00.767 --> 02:02.933
You're just saying everything
but the answer

02:02.968 --> 02:05.222
which is electricity
which led to the light bulb

02:05.224 --> 02:08.100
which is obviously
not going off in your head.

02:11.318 --> 02:12.618
All right, Raven.

02:13.618 --> 02:15.476
You really told
Petracelli off.

02:17.288 --> 02:19.803
So unless you have
anything else

02:19.805 --> 02:21.650
to waste class time with...

02:21.652 --> 02:24.006
As a matter of fact, I do.

02:25.018 --> 02:26.002
Let me break it down.

02:26.004 --> 02:27.354
Why do you only call on people

02:27.356 --> 02:29.018
who don't have
their hand raised?

02:29.020 --> 02:31.825
Whom I call on is my choice.

02:32.203 --> 02:33.345
Sit down.

02:33.347 --> 02:36.239
Mmm. But see, I had my hand up
plenty of many of times today.

02:36.241 --> 02:38.762
But you only called on me
when I did not know the answer.

02:38.764 --> 02:40.272
And I know why.

02:40.274 --> 02:42.274
Because you have
more fun embarrassing us

02:42.276 --> 02:43.142
than teaching us.

02:43.144 --> 02:45.504
And trust me,
the whole class got my back

02:45.506 --> 02:46.971
on this one right here.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.196
It's probably, you know,
the wrong time

02:58.199 --> 02:59.794
to be talking about this, right?

02:59.796 --> 03:00.621
Right.

03:00.623 --> 03:02.886
And maybe, you know,
after school we could

03:02.888 --> 03:04.593
toss it around a little bit.

03:04.595 --> 03:05.784
Let's toss it around.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.340
Good idea.

03:07.342 --> 03:09.094
Why don't you and I

03:09.096 --> 03:11.532
toss it around
tomorrow after school.

03:11.534 --> 03:16.019
And, hey, let's toss in
your parents, too.

03:19.625 --> 03:20.756
All right, Raven.

03:20.758 --> 03:22.273
You really told
Petracelli off.

03:22.275 --> 03:23.598
Rae... Rae...

04:16.726 --> 04:18.451
Yep, that's me.

04:27.199 --> 04:29.385
Okay, my parents have
to meet with Petracelli.

04:29.387 --> 04:30.574
They are going to freak.

04:30.576 --> 04:31.706
How am I going
to tell them?

04:31.708 --> 04:32.668
Just fake being sick.

04:32.670 --> 04:33.730
They can't get mad
if you're sick.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.166
I stopped doing that kind
of stuff when I was eight.

04:37.266 --> 04:38.444
It's brilliant.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.830
Yeah.

04:40.832 --> 04:42.840
And I got a great recipe
for fake vomit.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.288
Little bit of cream corn

04:44.290 --> 04:46.090
some yogurt
and some dog food.

04:47.614 --> 04:50.982
And if you pop it in the oven
at 350, it'll actually steam.

04:53.580 --> 04:54.839
Excuse me.

04:55.836 --> 04:58.527
Say, brother,
that's my locker!

04:59.298 --> 05:00.298
I know.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.348
I had it last year.

05:01.350 --> 05:02.332
It's a good location.

05:02.334 --> 05:03.999
Right next to
the water fountain.

05:04.001 --> 05:05.631
But there are lots
of water fountains.

05:05.633 --> 05:07.168
I like this one.

05:08.507 --> 05:10.391
You can't do this!

05:10.393 --> 05:11.916
I know my rights!

05:13.200 --> 05:13.998
I don't get it.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.889
What's so great about being near
that water fountain?

05:16.595 --> 05:17.862
Exhibit "A".

05:26.079 --> 05:28.989
Fake vomit is great,
but I need more.

05:28.991 --> 05:30.935
I need a master in deceit

05:30.937 --> 05:33.988
and the art of psychological
manipulations.

05:33.990 --> 05:36.185
That's why I came to you.

05:39.411 --> 05:41.262
You made a wise choice.

05:42.712 --> 05:45.312
I'm going to need
that five bucks up front.

05:50.168 --> 05:51.833
It's cool. Now...

05:51.835 --> 05:55.047
This little trick
works on Mom and Dad every time.

05:55.049 --> 05:56.431
I call it...

05:56.433 --> 05:57.746
"the three Cs."

05:57.748 --> 05:59.248
Now what does that stand for?

05:59.250 --> 06:00.988
"Crazy, creepy and constipated"?

06:00.990 --> 06:02.386
That was one night!

06:04.071 --> 06:06.309
Now do you want
my help or not?

06:06.687 --> 06:07.904
Okay, I'm sorry.

06:07.906 --> 06:09.199
The three Cs are?

06:09.201 --> 06:13.872
"Cuddle," "compliment"
and the ever popular "cry".

06:14.319 --> 06:15.823
Wait a second.
That's what got you out of

06:15.825 --> 06:17.394
burning the Christmas tree
in '98?

06:17.396 --> 06:18.596
Yep.

06:18.598 --> 06:22.014
I cuddled up in Mom's arms,
complimented Dad

06:22.015 --> 06:24.066
on the great job he did
with the Christmas lights.

06:24.068 --> 06:26.435
And I even got a little tear.

06:26.437 --> 06:28.140
Right here.

06:29.499 --> 06:31.367
And they still gave you
that new bike.

06:31.368 --> 06:32.792
And a basketball.

06:32.794 --> 06:36.750
Yeah... '98
was a good year.

06:37.907 --> 06:38.934
Corey Baxter!

06:38.936 --> 06:40.514
Get down here
right now!

06:40.516 --> 06:43.681
Okay, I really screwed
up in school today.

06:43.683 --> 06:45.521
You might want to
come and take notes.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.380
Do you know who I just got off
the phone with?

06:54.382 --> 06:55.307
Your teacher.

06:55.309 --> 06:57.088
You have been acting up
in class again.

06:57.090 --> 06:58.538
Victor, talk to your son.

06:58.541 --> 06:59.459
Corey...

06:59.461 --> 07:00.608
Angry voice.

07:00.610 --> 07:01.669
Corey.

07:02.954 --> 07:05.754
We are very disappointed
in you.

07:05.757 --> 07:07.422
I'm sorry, Daddy.

07:12.385 --> 07:13.920
Stay with me.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.550
Don't you go cuddling up to him

07:15.585 --> 07:17.496
or giving us any of your lame
compliments.

07:17.497 --> 07:19.289
And don't you even
think about crying

07:19.291 --> 07:20.429
or you're going
to see a side of me

07:20.432 --> 07:21.679
that's not very pretty.

07:21.681 --> 07:24.651
Mother, how is that possible
when you're so beautiful?

07:27.685 --> 07:29.582
Knock it off and
go to your room!

07:32.285 --> 07:34.358
I'm going to need
that five bucks back.

07:36.477 --> 07:37.790
What has gotten into him lately?

07:37.882 --> 07:40.092
He's always acting up
with his teachers.

07:40.128 --> 07:41.373
Don't be too hard on him, Mom.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.845
I mean, he's just a kid
and kids make mistakes.

07:44.332 --> 07:46.286
Was she just defending
her brother?

07:46.288 --> 07:47.514
I think so.

07:47.515 --> 07:50.252
I've got to sit down--
the room is spinning.

07:52.328 --> 07:54.181
Do you know what I think
we're seeing here?

07:54.183 --> 07:56.781
A more mature, responsible
young lady.

07:56.783 --> 07:58.313
The new Raven.

07:58.315 --> 08:01.310
Well, it's not really
the new Raven, really.

08:01.312 --> 08:02.869
I'm really the same ol' Raven.

08:02.871 --> 08:04.238
Your grades
have been good.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.852
You've been helping out
around the house.

08:05.854 --> 08:07.105
Yeah, I can't remember
the last time

08:07.107 --> 08:08.238
we were called down
to the school

08:08.240 --> 08:11.066
because you were, I don't know,
mouthing off about something.

08:12.355 --> 08:13.873
Um... I mean...

08:14.801 --> 08:16.010
Ooh, don't you miss it?

08:16.012 --> 08:17.590
I mean, those were
the good times.

08:17.592 --> 08:20.442
I messed up and you got mad.
Whee!

08:22.385 --> 08:25.033
Anyhow, we're so proud
of you

08:25.035 --> 08:27.342
that we have a little
something for you.

08:27.344 --> 08:30.002
Really? Well, I hope
it's a very little something.

08:30.994 --> 08:32.366
We were going to
wait to your birthday

08:32.369 --> 08:33.873
but now is a great time.

08:33.919 --> 08:34.924
Come on.

08:38.371 --> 08:39.750
And now...

08:39.751 --> 08:41.120
the greatest present

08:41.155 --> 08:42.726
a teenage girl
could ever want.

08:42.727 --> 08:45.428
"Ooh, you got me Lebron,
'cause I like them tall.

08:46.242 --> 08:47.741
#Here you go, baby.

08:47.743 --> 08:50.477
Oh. You got me a phone.

08:51.307 --> 08:52.903
With your own phone number.

08:52.906 --> 08:54.671
I even programmed the
speed dial for you.

08:54.673 --> 08:56.834
Your best friend in the
whole world is number one.

08:56.836 --> 08:57.546
Go ahead, try it.

08:57.547 --> 08:58.438
Okay.

09:00.702 --> 09:02.094
Hey, girlfriend.

09:07.102 --> 09:08.649
I'll show you how
to delete it later.

09:08.651 --> 09:10.039
Okay.

09:10.825 --> 09:14.350
Uh, Mom... Dad...

09:14.385 --> 09:16.729
You know, I don't really know
how to say this...

09:16.730 --> 09:17.963
And you don't have to.

09:17.966 --> 09:19.615
Just keep up the good work.

09:22.585 --> 09:23.765
Call me.

09:29.725 --> 09:30.968
Yay.

09:35.043 --> 09:37.043
Rae, just hang up
and go tell them the truth.

09:37.045 --> 09:38.354
They'll understand.

09:38.356 --> 09:40.694
Not after they told me
how proud they were of me.

09:40.696 --> 09:43.205
No way, okay?
To them, I'm the new Raven.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.304
And the new Raven
doesn't mess up.

09:45.306 --> 09:47.685
So, what's the new
Raven going to do?

09:47.687 --> 09:50.777
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to go to Petracelli

09:50.779 --> 09:53.104
talk to him-- no parents--
one-on-one.

09:56.124 --> 09:57.473
Go get your mother.

09:57.475 --> 09:58.697
Today!

09:58.699 --> 10:00.102
Aah...!

10:02.262 --> 10:04.039
Okay, that didn't go
too well.

10:04.748 --> 10:06.253
I want my mommy.

10:18.882 --> 10:20.590
Look at that slob.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.148
He's disgusting!

10:22.150 --> 10:23.275
I mean, that is my locker

10:23.284 --> 10:24.357
and if I don't take
a stand now

10:24.359 --> 10:26.311
it's going to ruin
my reputation!

10:26.313 --> 10:29.211
Thomas, you don't have
"a reputation!"

10:33.239 --> 10:34.534
Hey, man.

10:34.536 --> 10:36.236
We got a problem.

10:36.238 --> 10:36.834
We do?

10:36.836 --> 10:39.067
Yeah, I'm not sharing
my locker, okay?

10:39.069 --> 10:40.223
Oh, that's cool.

10:41.855 --> 10:45.245
Uh, uh, uh, you-you're
throwing out my stuff.

10:45.247 --> 10:47.314
And it can go
into my old locker.

10:47.316 --> 10:49.042
Here's the
combination.

10:49.044 --> 10:50.872
Problem solved.

10:57.525 --> 10:59.385
# When the temperature's hot #

10:59.387 --> 11:01.431
# And the music is pumping #

11:01.433 --> 11:02.533
Slow down.

11:02.535 --> 11:04.828
This is a hallway,
not a freeway!

11:07.848 --> 11:08.843
None of that.

11:14.785 --> 11:16.386
Looking good, Ritchie.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.075
# Honey, don't go runnin'
to your mama. #

11:20.077 --> 11:22.100
Well, you look like
a fine young student.

11:22.102 --> 11:24.522
Could you please point me
to Mr. Petracelli's class?

11:24.524 --> 11:26.731
Yeah, uh, one floor down,
first door to your left.

11:26.733 --> 11:29.007
Aren't you a nice young man?
Look at those cheeks!

11:29.009 --> 11:30.901
Oh, come on with the
pinching of the cheeks!

11:31.837 --> 11:33.043
It's me-- Raven.

11:33.044 --> 11:34.523
Raven?

11:34.525 --> 11:37.423
No, I am Tonya Baxter.

11:37.425 --> 11:39.085
Raven's mother.

11:39.808 --> 11:41.501
My daughter is in
a bit of a jam

11:41.503 --> 11:43.426
and I'm here to bail
her out, all right?

11:46.681 --> 11:48.378
I'm coming back for you.

11:51.925 --> 11:53.270
Come on, Daddy, let's go.

11:53.272 --> 11:54.739
Come on now.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.634
You don't even
look like your mom.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.770
You look more like
you ate your mom.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.379
Relax, Eddie, okay?

12:09.381 --> 12:11.018
Petracelli's
never even met my mom.

12:11.020 --> 12:11.980
I'll just go in there

12:11.982 --> 12:13.359
tell him Raven
is grounded for life

12:13.361 --> 12:14.911
and then I'll
unground myself.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.828
All right, I'm going to go in
to see Mr. Petracelli.

12:18.830 --> 12:20.954
I want you to count to ten,
knock on the door

12:20.956 --> 12:22.230
and say that there's
an emergency at home

12:22.232 --> 12:23.587
and that I have a phone call.

12:25.543 --> 12:28.688
Well, hello there,
Mr. Petracelli.

12:28.690 --> 12:31.172
I'm Tonya Baxter,
Raven's mother.

12:31.174 --> 12:32.196
Uh, thanks for coming.

12:32.804 --> 12:35.698
Anything for my baby's
favorite teacher.

12:42.055 --> 12:43.368
Uh, so...

12:47.451 --> 12:50.579
I know this is about my baby
getting talkative in class

12:50.581 --> 12:52.816
and she assures me
that she's very sorry

12:52.818 --> 12:54.189
and it'll never
happen again.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.150
Is that someone knocking?

12:57.578 --> 12:58.831
I, uh,
I didn't hear anything.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.558
Mrs. Baxter, where's Raven?

13:00.560 --> 13:02.893
Raven is...

13:03.562 --> 13:07.322
out in the car crying,
crying her little eyes out.

13:07.324 --> 13:09.254
Big puffy red things,
runny nose

13:09.256 --> 13:11.418
even a face
a mother wouldn't look at.

13:11.420 --> 13:14.211
Now I'm sure
I heard somebody knocking!

13:17.193 --> 13:19.464
There is no one there.

13:19.467 --> 13:23.323
Now, I need to speak with
you and Raven together.

13:24.272 --> 13:26.539
Okay, when would you
want that, Mr. Petracelli.

13:26.542 --> 13:27.542
Oh, when?

13:27.544 --> 13:28.965
Let me check my calendar.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.297
Now!

13:30.525 --> 13:32.186
Okay, then.

13:32.522 --> 13:34.358
I'll see what I can do.

13:41.932 --> 13:42.773
Knock, knock.

13:42.775 --> 13:43.337
Who's there?

13:43.340 --> 13:44.480
Not you!

13:53.562 --> 13:54.715
Excuse me.

13:54.717 --> 13:55.810
But I think the mayonnaise

13:55.812 --> 13:58.593
on my sardine sandwich
I ate for lunch went bad

13:58.595 --> 14:01.493
so, uh, I want to apologize
for any discomfort

14:01.495 --> 14:03.390
I may cause you young ladies.

14:03.393 --> 14:06.564
If you have perfume,
I'd spray it now.

14:16.149 --> 14:17.014
Hurry up.

14:17.049 --> 14:18.861
Okay, okay.
How do I look?

14:18.863 --> 14:19.954
You have your
mother's hair.

14:19.956 --> 14:21.338
You know, I've been
told that...

14:21.340 --> 14:22.432
No, no.

14:22.434 --> 14:24.389
You have your mother's hair.

14:24.391 --> 14:25.977
Oh, oh, okay, okay.

14:25.979 --> 14:27.518
Is my hair okay, now?

14:27.520 --> 14:28.534
Okay, do I look okay?

14:28.536 --> 14:29.825
Look, I'll meet you
back here

14:29.827 --> 14:31.458
after I check out my new locker.

14:31.460 --> 14:32.821
Good luck.

14:42.643 --> 14:43.607
Is this your locker?

14:43.642 --> 14:45.151
Not really.

14:45.153 --> 14:46.738
Mine's on the third floor.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.186
Some big guy took it
and made me come here.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.293
Oh, you, too?
Hey, Larry.

14:51.295 --> 14:52.644
Hey, Brendan.

14:52.646 --> 14:53.896
Wait a minute.

14:53.898 --> 14:54.619
You mean to tell me

14:54.629 --> 14:56.070
you both share
this locker?

14:56.072 --> 14:57.245
Yeah, that guy's
stolen

14:57.247 --> 14:58.166
all the good lockers.

14:58.168 --> 15:00.021
My was right next
to the snack machine.

15:00.023 --> 15:01.677
This is crazy.

15:01.679 --> 15:03.090
We can't let him
get away with this.

15:03.092 --> 15:04.225
We outnumber him, y'all.

15:04.227 --> 15:05.537
We should take some action.

15:05.539 --> 15:06.799
Hey, Leland,
this guy

15:06.801 --> 15:08.172
wants to get
our lockers back

15:08.174 --> 15:09.256
like you tried
to do.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.937
So my mom says
you wanted to see me.

15:16.972 --> 15:19.274
Uh, yes. With her.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.791
Together. Both of you.

15:21.793 --> 15:23.820
Is that really necessary?

15:23.822 --> 15:25.695
I mean, why don't you
and I just sit down...

15:25.697 --> 15:26.769
Go get your mother.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.172
Today!

15:28.174 --> 15:29.337
Aaahhh...

15:50.115 --> 15:51.407
Is Raven here?

15:51.409 --> 15:52.142
Oh, what a shame.

15:52.144 --> 15:53.704
Why don't the two of us
just talk this out?

15:53.706 --> 15:54.836
No.

15:55.533 --> 15:57.086
Oh, cranky.

15:57.088 --> 15:59.173
Someone needs
a little nappy nap.

16:04.826 --> 16:06.111
Is my mother here?

16:06.113 --> 16:07.437
She just left.

16:07.439 --> 16:08.803
Now why did she do that?

16:08.805 --> 16:10.443
She knows we need
to talk about this.

16:10.445 --> 16:11.588
Tell her that. No, wait.

16:11.590 --> 16:12.606
I'll tell her.

16:12.608 --> 16:14.089
No! Wait!
I'll tell her!

16:14.091 --> 16:15.321
Mrs. Baxter.

16:16.234 --> 16:17.507
Coming, I'm coming.

16:17.509 --> 16:18.774
Mrs. Bax...

16:18.776 --> 16:20.008
You called?

16:20.918 --> 16:22.544
I'm a busy man, Mrs. Baxter.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.982
I've talked to you

16:23.984 --> 16:26.376
I've talked to your daughter,
and now I'm going home

16:26.378 --> 16:27.542
to talk to myself

16:27.577 --> 16:30.142
and ask why I ever became
a teacher.

16:30.177 --> 16:33.377
Well, does that mean you
don't want to see Raven?

16:33.718 --> 16:35.463
I don't need
to see anyone anymore...

16:35.466 --> 16:37.010
except maybe my mother.

16:38.209 --> 16:40.237
Bye-bye, Mr. Petracelli.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.717
I heard you stole
my baby's locker.

17:06.719 --> 17:08.058
Look, all I was...

17:11.397 --> 17:14.058
All right, now you get your
things out of there pronto.

17:14.060 --> 17:16.148
Am I making myself clear?

17:16.151 --> 17:16.875
But I've got all...

17:16.877 --> 17:17.704
Hey!

17:19.877 --> 17:21.563
Now don't you
"but" me, boy.

17:23.097 --> 17:25.079
And if you say
any of this to Eddie

17:25.082 --> 17:27.445
I got a bigger purse
with buckles.

17:37.877 --> 17:39.586
We're looking
for Mr. Petracelli.

17:39.588 --> 17:41.156
We're Raven Baxter's
parents.

17:42.733 --> 17:44.033
Oh, oh, no.

17:44.035 --> 17:45.137
Okay, okay...

17:46.339 --> 17:47.902
You're young, walk.

17:47.937 --> 17:49.984
All right, mom in the house!

17:59.559 --> 18:00.989
All right, look.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.403
The guys and I
have talked this over

18:03.405 --> 18:05.352
and although we prefer
to avoid physical violence...

18:05.354 --> 18:06.172
Or harsh language.

18:06.174 --> 18:07.788
Or intimidating
gestures.

18:07.790 --> 18:10.614
I got this, guys.

18:13.954 --> 18:16.490
Now could you please
give us back our lockers?

18:16.491 --> 18:17.856
You know what?

18:20.732 --> 18:22.032
You can have them.

18:26.807 --> 18:28.877
Sure is good
to be back home.

18:32.107 --> 18:35.541
Mr. Petracelli, what are
you still doing here?

18:35.543 --> 18:37.395
Oh, joy, you've returned.

18:38.037 --> 18:39.564
Only because
I was worried

18:39.566 --> 18:41.862
about you staying here
at all times of night

18:41.864 --> 18:42.702
cracking your neck.

18:42.737 --> 18:44.097
What kind of life
is that?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.576
Mrs. Baxter,
are you in the PTA?

18:45.578 --> 18:46.142
No.

18:46.144 --> 18:47.074
Let's keep it that way.

18:47.076 --> 18:48.041
All right.

18:52.463 --> 18:54.307
Excuse me, we're looking
for Mr. Petracelli.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.134
We're Raven Baxter's
parents.

18:56.363 --> 18:59.513
Uh, no,
it's Ms. Petracelli.

18:59.515 --> 19:01.277
But we got a message
on our machine

19:01.312 --> 19:02.747
from a Mr. Petracelli.

19:02.749 --> 19:05.407
No, see, in the morning
I got a little cold.

19:05.442 --> 19:06.407
See, uh...

19:08.741 --> 19:10.326
So, uh, maybe
you should leave.

19:12.137 --> 19:14.807
Um, the message on
the machine said that, uh

19:14.842 --> 19:16.337
Raven was talking back.

19:16.727 --> 19:17.929
Talking back

19:17.931 --> 19:18.846
speaking up.

19:18.848 --> 19:20.528
I just call it
a big, old

19:20.531 --> 19:22.036
misunderstanding.

19:22.477 --> 19:24.519
Now, which
brings us back

19:24.521 --> 19:26.071
to "bye-bye."

19:30.622 --> 19:33.039
Still here, all right,
you're still here.

19:33.042 --> 19:34.342
Okay.

19:35.731 --> 19:36.995
Oh, look, a bake sale.

19:36.997 --> 19:40.885
Ms. Petracelli, we took off
the entire afternoon

19:40.887 --> 19:41.969
to come down here.

19:41.971 --> 19:43.102
So we're not leaving

19:43.104 --> 19:45.374
until we get this
whole thing sorted out.

19:45.956 --> 19:47.867
All right,
we're not going...

19:47.869 --> 19:49.093
Okay, all right.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.783
Oh, now look at...
what is this

19:51.785 --> 19:52.874
doing here?

19:52.970 --> 19:54.515
I did not know Brazil

19:54.517 --> 19:55.605
was that big.

19:56.121 --> 19:57.309
You know, it's funny.

19:57.311 --> 19:59.637
We were just saying how
responsible Raven's become.

20:00.306 --> 20:01.775
We even got her
a new phone.

20:01.777 --> 20:03.982
And she loves that
phone like a puppy.

20:03.984 --> 20:06.507
She said. To me.

20:07.577 --> 20:09.177
Oh, look, I got mail.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.972
You know, what
bothers me the most

20:13.007 --> 20:15.726
that if Raven was having
a problem in school

20:15.728 --> 20:17.176
why didn't she come
to us about it?

20:17.178 --> 20:19.677
Mm-hmm. Any thoughts
about that, Ms. Petracelli?

20:20.761 --> 20:23.440
Well, if I was Raven

20:23.442 --> 20:24.772
which I'm not

20:26.337 --> 20:27.870
maybe she would be afraid
to come to you

20:27.872 --> 20:30.661
because she thinks that
you want her to be perfect

20:30.663 --> 20:32.042
she said to me.

20:32.784 --> 20:34.807
We don't expect her
to be perfect.

20:34.809 --> 20:35.616
Yes, you do.

20:35.618 --> 20:37.219
You even called her
"The New Raven."

20:39.077 --> 20:41.042
Look, Ms. Petracelli

20:41.305 --> 20:43.648
maybe we gave Raven
the wrong idea.

20:44.294 --> 20:46.543
We are very proud of her,
but that doesn't mean

20:46.545 --> 20:48.642
we don't expect her
to mess up sometimes.

20:48.677 --> 20:50.940
Yeah, we want her to feel
like she can come to us

20:50.942 --> 20:52.763
even when she does
mess up.

20:52.807 --> 20:55.142
And if Raven doesn't
know all that

20:55.177 --> 20:58.059
then maybe we're not
doing our jobs as parents.

20:59.886 --> 21:01.707
Raven thinks
you're doing a great job.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.489
Really?

21:04.735 --> 21:05.691
Really.

21:07.796 --> 21:09.426
Victor, look.

21:09.655 --> 21:10.957
It's Raven.

21:10.992 --> 21:12.970
Holy cow.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.249
It is.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.012
Okay, now when
did y'all find out?

21:18.783 --> 21:21.574
Well, when your butt
went left, you went right.

21:25.513 --> 21:27.278
Betrayed by the booty.

21:36.527 --> 21:38.349
I know I disappointed you

21:38.351 --> 21:41.415
but will you please
stop staring at me like that?

21:44.107 --> 21:44.972
Raven, please.

21:44.974 --> 21:46.750
We're only taking the
phone away for two weeks.

21:46.752 --> 21:49.063
But it looks so sad, Dad.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.226
Call me.

21:59.594 --> 22:01.377
I just have
one question.

22:01.412 --> 22:03.072
When you put this on

22:03.107 --> 22:05.485
exactly what mother
were you thinking of?

22:08.037 --> 22:09.355
You look bootylicious.
