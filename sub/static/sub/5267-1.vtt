<i>Unemployment is up,
says the Department of Labor...</i>

00:47.406 --> 00:51.399
<i>... with nearly 200,000 more claims
for unemployment last month.</i>

00:51.677 --> 00:56.239
<i>Americans whose income is below the
poverty line has risen to 2 million...</i>

00:56.515 --> 00:59.177
<i>... compared to 1.6 million in 1979.</i>

00:59.418 --> 01:01.682
<i>Economists say that the
economic inequality...</i>

01:01.887 --> 01:05.015
<i>... is at its worst level since
the days of the Great Depression.</i>

01:06.091 --> 01:10.755
<i>Over the last 3 years, the percentage of
after-tax income for the rich rose 3%...</i>

01:11.096 --> 01:14.031
<i>... while after-tax income
for the poor fell.2%.</i>

01:14.266 --> 01:16.130
<i>Homelessness is at an all-time high.</i>

01:16.334 --> 01:19.929
<i>A drive-by shooting in Harlem resulted
in the death of a 7-year-old boy.</i>

01:20.204 --> 01:22.570
<i>Police say the shooting
was drug-related.</i>

01:22.773 --> 01:25.333
<i>Said a police source,
"The kid just got in the way."</i>

01:25.543 --> 01:30.207
<i>The bodies of 3 young black men
were discovered in Marcus Garvey Park.</i>

01:30.448 --> 01:33.713
<i>Police believe they were victims
of a drug deal gone bad.</i>

01:33.951 --> 01:37.785
<i>The identity of the victims
has been withheld.</i>

01:38.055 --> 01:42.719
<i>Firemen were summoned to extract a man
from a ventilator duct of a building.</i>

01:42.960 --> 01:47.897
<i>The man became trapped when he entered
the duct in order to rob the premises.</i>

01:48.232 --> 01:53.033
<i>The deficit now stands
at an astounding $ 221 billion.</i>

01:53.804 --> 01:58.138
<i>A reputed crime lord and 10 of his
henchmen were gunned down today.</i>

01:58.409 --> 02:02.311
<i>Witnesses said the gunmen
rode past Mr. Armeteo...</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:04.810
<i>... and sprayed the group with gunfire.</i>

02:05.082 --> 02:07.710
<i>The shooting was the result
of an ongoing turf war.</i>

02:44.254 --> 02:45.482
Biff...

02:45.722 --> 02:46.950
...look at you now.

02:47.190 --> 02:48.487
Nino, please!

02:48.725 --> 02:50.090
Don't start bitching up.

02:50.293 --> 02:52.693
You don't have my product or my money.

02:52.962 --> 02:56.762
You gotta give me another chance!
Please!

02:56.933 --> 02:58.400
Brothers don't wait to get paid.

02:58.635 --> 03:01.160
Money talks.
Bullshit runs the marathon.

03:01.371 --> 03:04.534
So, see you,
and I wouldn't wanna be you.

03:13.783 --> 03:16.775
<i>The number of addicted
infants born in Manhattan...</i>

03:16.986 --> 03:19.386
<i>... has risen over the past few years.</i>

03:19.656 --> 03:21.020
<i>Hospital officials say...</i>

03:21.223 --> 03:25.387
<i>... that the care required by these
tiny victims of the cocaine epidemic...</i>

03:25.661 --> 03:30.325
<i>... has severely impacted the
available resources for pediatric care.</i>

03:30.566 --> 03:35.401
<i>In other news, an unidentified man found

<i>... is believed to be another victim
in an ongoing drug war...</i>

03:39.408 --> 03:42.172
<i>... that continues to plague our city.</i>

03:44.847 --> 03:46.678
Get out of my shit.

03:50.919 --> 03:55.856
Thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory forever and ever. Amen.

03:57.192 --> 04:00.355
I like to pray before I start
scrambling. Keeps people honest.

04:00.596 --> 04:02.530
Say that shit, say that shit.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.028
Do this now. What's your price?

04:05.267 --> 04:08.031
Yo, man. For you, Bob Marley, 17.

04:08.270 --> 04:12.172
For a key? You must be
doing the dope. Bring this down.

04:12.374 --> 04:13.898
You got to get realistic.

04:14.109 --> 04:16.942
I'm talking about a lower price. Down.

04:17.779 --> 04:22.682
This ain't Delancy Street, and you can't
Jew me down. That's my price.

04:24.385 --> 04:27.377
Check this out, homeboy.
God's on your side, right?

04:27.622 --> 04:31.251
Why don't we do this reasonable?
14K, bam.

04:32.293 --> 04:35.091
You wanna do this correct or not?
Seventeen.

04:35.296 --> 04:36.786
Let me see the money.

04:38.132 --> 04:39.793
Come on. Let's do this, man.

04:45.339 --> 04:46.772
What you know about that?

06:27.407 --> 06:29.397
Everybody out! Get down!

06:30.009 --> 06:31.374
Everybody down! Police!

06:35.080 --> 06:38.572
You think you slick, you little punk,
blasphemous dope-fiend bitch!

06:38.851 --> 06:41.217
Spit in my face, I'm gonna kill you!

06:41.420 --> 06:44.912
- You fucking that kid up.
- He's kicking his monkey ass.

06:45.257 --> 06:47.384
Ease back, goddamn it! I'm a cop!

06:51.597 --> 06:52.825
Shut the fuck up!

06:53.032 --> 06:55.500
It's over. You have the right
to remain silent.

06:55.701 --> 07:00.638
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.449
I'm gonna get paid.

07:17.589 --> 07:21.457
If I make this, you're gonna have
to come out your pockets.

07:36.908 --> 07:39.172
- Ain't made that shot in years.
- Pay your taxes.

07:39.410 --> 07:41.810
I'm like the IRS.

07:43.514 --> 07:45.243
That's it! I love it.

07:51.989 --> 07:54.253
What's up? Where you going?

08:03.768 --> 08:05.235
Remember when we was kids...

08:05.837 --> 08:08.465
...we played for Reverend Oates?
MO AB Bitty Squad?

08:09.474 --> 08:12.136
I was 11, you was 13.
We was the baddest backcourt...

08:12.343 --> 08:13.970
...in Each-One-Teach-One.

08:14.846 --> 08:16.609
We wasn't making no money then.

08:16.848 --> 08:21.285
And now that we are, you're here
living your Michael Jordan fantasy.

08:21.519 --> 08:23.077
Business must be good.

08:23.287 --> 08:25.016
It will be, brother.

08:25.523 --> 08:26.854
Peep this out.

08:30.628 --> 08:32.095
Freebase. So what?

08:32.296 --> 08:34.889
Yo, man, you know the rules.

08:35.465 --> 08:38.798
Us brothers don't be getting high.

08:39.302 --> 08:42.361
Shut the fuck up and drive the car,
you non-talking bastard.

08:42.639 --> 08:44.903
You been making money
outside the family?

08:45.142 --> 08:48.134
I just been doing a little
experimentation-type thing.

08:48.378 --> 08:51.211
A little experimentation-type thing.
Like what?

08:51.481 --> 08:56.282
At the clubs, some of the guys step away
from the blackjack table or the bar...

08:56.486 --> 08:58.852
...to buy $50 or $ 100 worth of sniff.

08:59.055 --> 09:01.717
I set them up in the back room
with a hit of base...

09:01.925 --> 09:06.021
...and 15 minutes after leaving the club,
they'd be back with 2 and 3 people.

09:06.229 --> 09:07.491
So what?

09:08.231 --> 09:13.066
They ain't come back for the cocaine.
They came back for the base.

09:15.505 --> 09:18.303
You sound like
this shit'll change the world.

09:18.508 --> 09:22.672
I don't know about all that
change-the-world shit, but I do know...

09:22.913 --> 09:26.610
...they be going crazy over this.
And the bitches...

09:26.850 --> 09:31.583
Oh, Lord! Them bitches,
they do anything for this, man!

09:32.289 --> 09:36.020
I had my jimmy waxed every day
last week. You understand?

09:36.259 --> 09:37.748
Several times a day.

09:38.427 --> 09:40.088
Get the fuck out of here!

09:42.198 --> 09:45.599
I know damn well ain't nobody
sucked your shriveled-up dick.

09:45.868 --> 09:47.267
You trying to dis me?

09:47.536 --> 09:50.699
I'm just telling the truth.
That's all I'm doing.

09:51.774 --> 09:54.607
Several times a day, my ass.

09:56.545 --> 09:59.605
All right, let me think about this
a little bit.

10:01.784 --> 10:03.775
You think this base...

10:04.053 --> 10:05.611
...is the high-powered shit?

10:05.888 --> 10:10.291
We gonna come off like the Mob.
You understand what I'm saying?

10:20.402 --> 10:24.133
Welcome right here to the Spotlite,
where we make the beat right...

10:24.406 --> 10:27.807
...and we can't fight.
So leave your drugs and go home.

10:28.244 --> 10:29.802
D.J. Clark Kent.

10:33.082 --> 10:36.711
Rocking from turntable number one
to turntable number two.

10:36.919 --> 10:38.443
Just like he want to do.

10:38.654 --> 10:40.245
You gonna frisk me too?

10:45.159 --> 10:49.528
Yo, my boy, Nino in the house.
Yo, Nino. What's up?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.261
You want a flower?

11:24.432 --> 11:26.923
I think you'll like him.
Here he is.

11:27.869 --> 11:29.200
What's up, crew?

11:30.371 --> 11:32.362
Nino, your girl looks good.

11:34.309 --> 11:36.300
You must like slumming, Kareem.

11:37.312 --> 11:41.749
Why would a high-class guy like you
leave a good computer job at the bank...

11:41.950 --> 11:44.850
...come all the way uptown
by gypsy cab...

11:45.052 --> 11:46.952
...to work among a den of thieves?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.348
I'm no dummy.

11:48.655 --> 11:50.714
It's basic common sense and arithmetic.

11:50.924 --> 11:54.121
The difference between
them paying me $800 a week...

11:54.328 --> 11:56.660
...and you paying me $8,000 a week.

11:56.897 --> 11:58.797
I think my cousin also likes the fact...

11:58.999 --> 12:01.866
...that you're in the tradition
of Joe Kennedy.

12:02.035 --> 12:03.798
Who?

12:04.905 --> 12:09.399
Good. Because you gotta rob
to get rich in the Reagan era.

12:09.910 --> 12:12.743
They running a strange program.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.516
More poor and disenfranchised folks
than this place has ever seen.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.048
They try to act like it don't exist.

12:19.252 --> 12:20.810
Meanwhile, the rich get richer...

12:21.021 --> 12:22.488
And the poor don't get a thing.

12:22.689 --> 12:26.682
Times like these, people wanna
get high. Real high and real fast.

12:26.927 --> 12:28.394
And this is gonna do it.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.361
And make us rich.

12:34.534 --> 12:37.867
I mean, what,
people going crazy over this?

12:38.271 --> 12:41.069
It look like cracked-off pieces of soap.

12:42.876 --> 12:45.537
The Colombians and Dominicans
have shown us the way.

12:45.778 --> 12:47.712
The shit is large.

12:47.947 --> 12:50.006
But we'll do it differently.

12:50.216 --> 12:52.275
No more selling on street corners.

12:52.551 --> 12:55.520
Change the product,
you change the marketing strategy.

12:55.721 --> 12:57.382
I've seen the future.

12:58.224 --> 13:00.886
And its name is The Carter.

13:01.260 --> 13:04.661
Hold up. The Carter Apartments,
that joint is big.

13:04.930 --> 13:08.627
We're talking about
combinating and consolidating.

13:09.168 --> 13:11.227
You're taking over The Carter?

13:11.437 --> 13:15.931
We taking over The Carter. We gonna
bum-rush the whole damn thing.

13:16.275 --> 13:20.769
Now just imagine,
if the tenants cooperate, it's lovely.

13:21.013 --> 13:23.174
They become loyal customers.

13:23.516 --> 13:28.351
If they don't, fuck it. It's like
in Beirut, they become live-in hostages.

13:28.621 --> 13:32.148
We gonna set up a lab here
to make the product.

13:32.425 --> 13:37.192
You hook up the computer, watch out for
the workers, the money and the product.

13:37.463 --> 13:39.727
The Duh Duh Man, Keisha,
we need security...

13:39.965 --> 13:42.399
...to ward off the rival crews,
screen customers.

13:42.635 --> 13:44.466
We also need lookouts...

13:44.804 --> 13:47.238
...here, here and here.

13:47.573 --> 13:49.130
Alert us of 5-0.

13:49.974 --> 13:54.741
One place to make the product,
one place to collect our money.

13:56.147 --> 13:57.808
We will own this fucking city.

13:58.083 --> 14:01.814
You's a genius, man. A pure, un...

14:03.922 --> 14:08.222
Unadulterated. Would you please shut
the fuck up before you have a seizure?

14:08.660 --> 14:11.754
Hey, man, suck my dick.

14:13.665 --> 14:15.599
It's a brilliant plan.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.927
But one thing does concern me, though.

14:18.269 --> 14:21.329
That curry-goat-eating, skinny-ass
Fat Smitty.

14:21.706 --> 14:25.335
He controls The Carter.
Time to sing that fat bitch a lullaby.

14:25.610 --> 14:27.134
Rock-a-bye baby.

14:27.345 --> 14:29.074
He'll be hanging with Elvis.

14:31.349 --> 14:32.577
Damn.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.013
Crack.

14:43.528 --> 14:48.192
Hey, dreadlocks. What did Bombock
have to say? That bitch!

14:49.701 --> 14:51.292
Let me speak with you.

14:52.302 --> 14:55.430
Rastaman, I'm here to tell you
Nino Brown says...

14:55.639 --> 14:59.040
...your services are no longer
needed in the community.

15:02.746 --> 15:07.012
That's how you kill somebody. You get
right up on the motherfucker and blam!

15:07.217 --> 15:11.711
Blow his brains all over the sidewalk
in broad daylight.

15:11.989 --> 15:13.388
Rock-a-bye baby.

15:13.657 --> 15:17.650
Brother, I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

15:18.162 --> 15:22.326
Now look, you are gonna give up
those apartments, huh?

15:22.666 --> 15:25.965
And you are gonna turn over
control of The Carter.

15:26.503 --> 15:28.368
Because if you don't...

15:28.572 --> 15:31.632
...this shotgun blows your big,
fat head off...

15:31.842 --> 15:34.834
...before you can get
your clothes back on.

15:35.078 --> 15:36.306
Is that clear?

18:02.489 --> 18:05.151
If you just say "no,"
what will you say "yes" to?

18:05.392 --> 18:08.054
We say "yes" to education.

18:08.228 --> 18:11.288
We say "yes" to dedication.
We climb up...

18:11.498 --> 18:15.867
...to a higher station
of new spiritual motivation...

18:16.170 --> 18:19.435
...to make a positive impact
on our nation.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.479
<i>Sergeant, I'm talking to you.</i>

18:31.685 --> 18:35.678
I wanna know how drug pushers can take
over an entire apartment building...

18:35.923 --> 18:37.185
...right under your nose.

18:37.591 --> 18:41.584
If you lived in The Carter Apartments,
there'd be cops all over the place.

18:42.029 --> 18:44.862
Hey, don't walk away. Listen to me!

18:45.099 --> 18:49.365
I fought for this country. We pay taxes
and we're prisoners in our home.

18:51.872 --> 18:54.363
I told the Commissioner
you were running late.

18:55.542 --> 18:58.102
- You got those files?
- Right here.

19:05.485 --> 19:07.077
Let's hope he buys it.

19:08.821 --> 19:12.348
Peretti and Appleton. No way, Stone.
Who else you got?

19:12.525 --> 19:14.459
- They're the ones I need.
- You kidding me?

19:14.660 --> 19:19.461
Nick Peretti almost killed his partner
in a chase, Appleton's on suspension.

19:19.632 --> 19:22.499
- Probation.
- Semantics, Stone.

19:23.269 --> 19:24.759
These two are trouble.

19:27.340 --> 19:31.003
You and I know the system
wasn't ready for this epidemic.

19:31.277 --> 19:33.802
Crack came on the scene
and spread like wildfire.

19:34.013 --> 19:36.777
But now I got the mayor
and the governor on my back...

19:37.016 --> 19:39.780
...and I need some results. Fast.

19:40.019 --> 19:41.919
You get me Nino Brown.

19:42.121 --> 19:45.682
Forget Peretti and Appleton.
The risk is too high.

19:47.794 --> 19:49.625
With all due respect, sir...

19:49.962 --> 19:51.520
...you still don't get it.

19:51.964 --> 19:55.161
You're not giving me what I need
to win this war.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.268
I need cops that know these streets.

19:57.470 --> 20:00.064
I need new jack cops
to take down a new jack gangster.

20:00.373 --> 20:01.635
What you call a risk...

20:02.809 --> 20:04.470
...I think is our only shot.

20:14.886 --> 20:16.251
You got your men.

20:19.658 --> 20:21.421
But I don't want any waves.

20:22.961 --> 20:24.895
Not a goddamn ripple.

20:54.658 --> 20:56.649
<i>Who the hell is this
psychedelic blotter-acid fool?</i>

20:56.860 --> 20:58.088
Be cool.

20:58.262 --> 21:03.199
This is Detective Nick Peretti, a crazy
motorcycle-freak, reject cop, like you.

21:03.867 --> 21:05.630
A wild man no one else wanted.

21:05.869 --> 21:07.961
He means I'm expendable.

21:08.204 --> 21:12.004
Whatever, man. What did you
come here for? To watch me exercise?

21:12.208 --> 21:15.143
I came here to lay a name on you.
Nino Brown?

21:15.378 --> 21:17.005
His sidekick, "Gee Money" wells?

21:17.213 --> 21:19.044
Call themselves
the Cash Money Brothers.

21:19.215 --> 21:21.149
Used to stickup two-bit jewelry stores.

21:21.817 --> 21:26.277
Yeah, thrill-seekers, wanna-be gangsters.
I hate them. So what's up?

21:26.489 --> 21:29.117
What's up is this.
We need some evidence.

21:29.392 --> 21:31.724
Evidence of murder, drug trafficking...

21:31.928 --> 21:34.795
...racketeering, tax evasion. Anything.

21:35.264 --> 21:38.131
We've never been able
to make anything stick on Brown.

21:38.634 --> 21:41.125
No shit. One-third of the department's
on Nino's payroll.

21:41.337 --> 21:44.363
The other 2/3 don't care
unless it affects their community.

21:44.574 --> 21:45.802
What you saying?

21:46.275 --> 21:49.403
Listen.
I've been authorized to set up...

21:49.612 --> 21:52.410
...an independent drug-fighting unit
and I'm picking you.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.674
- Why me?
- What do you mean, why you?

21:54.884 --> 21:59.583
You're from the neighborhood. I can
trust you. And I know you give a shit.

22:00.856 --> 22:02.380
So what's the catch?

22:03.359 --> 22:06.192
There's no catch, man.
Why you gotta say that?

22:06.429 --> 22:08.260
Because I know your ass, Stone.

22:09.599 --> 22:13.056
- Peretti goes with you.
- This big biscuit-head looking...

22:13.969 --> 22:17.598
Listen! It's not gonna be another
one of your wild-ass solo acts.

22:17.806 --> 22:21.242
Peretti is the only cop I could find
crazy enough to team up with you.

22:22.277 --> 22:23.767
This is my shot.

22:24.045 --> 22:26.605
And you fuck up, it's all on me.

22:28.984 --> 22:33.614
I wanna thank you because you know
I wanna get back in this war.

22:34.189 --> 22:36.123
But this guy, man...

22:37.993 --> 22:39.221
You in or out?

22:40.462 --> 22:42.123
I'm in, all right?

22:48.737 --> 22:52.298
What do you mean,
Frazier won't give up the apartments?

22:52.574 --> 22:57.409
I'm not asking him, I'm telling him!
I'll handle that fat bastard myself!

23:02.484 --> 23:05.146
- We're honored.
- No, I'm honored. Really.

23:10.959 --> 23:13.825
We understand you have
a new Peruvian connection.

23:15.329 --> 23:16.762
So what of it?

23:17.097 --> 23:20.260
We know you've started to centralize
operations at The Carter.

23:20.467 --> 23:25.336
And you didn't notify Don Armeteo,
who takes such things as an insult.

23:28.342 --> 23:29.331
Your point?

23:29.510 --> 23:34.413
My point is you fucking guys are cutting
us out of our agreed upon 10%.

23:36.350 --> 23:37.977
It's time we renegotiate.

23:39.420 --> 23:42.685
I'll tell you what, message boy.

23:43.624 --> 23:45.956
You go back and tell Don Armeteo:

23:46.694 --> 23:49.026
No renegotiating. Fuck that.

23:49.763 --> 23:53.790
The Cash Money Brothers
are a self-contained unit now.

23:54.134 --> 23:56.466
But you come see me next week.

23:56.670 --> 24:00.800
And I'll hook you up with some of them
collard green linguinis and shit.

24:02.176 --> 24:05.543
Chicken Alfredo. Chitlins Alfredo.

24:07.715 --> 24:09.182
Maybe get a better suit!

24:09.383 --> 24:10.941
Fuck you.

24:14.221 --> 24:16.484
Nino, I don't know.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.119
Frankie's an all-right guy.

24:19.325 --> 24:22.158
<i>Fuck them scungili- eating motherfuckers.</i>

24:22.395 --> 24:26.991
This is our thing. They don't wanna
roll with it, we'll roll over them.

24:43.082 --> 24:47.917
<i>This moolanyan must have an MX missile
instead of a cock, he gets so high.</i>

24:54.427 --> 24:55.917
Our snitch was right.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.163
Nino and his Cash Money monkeys...

24:58.364 --> 25:01.856
...are dealing with those spicaroos
up on Broadway and 171 st.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.092
They don't even deny it.

25:04.437 --> 25:06.871
Nor does he accept
our partnership no more.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.470
Now, Gee Money, he was cool.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.404
<i>It was that testa dura, Nino.</i>

25:17.817 --> 25:22.480
You know what I say. You lay down with
Peruvian dogs, you get Spanish fleas.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.913
Soon Nino will itch.

25:25.490 --> 25:28.482
We'll be there
to scratch the hell out of him.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.757
1700 hours.

25:37.102 --> 25:40.560
Suspects hand out consumables
and the natives are restless.

25:40.772 --> 25:42.933
Yo, shut the fuck up, man.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.901
Ten years as a low-life, murderous bum.

25:46.111 --> 25:50.605
Nino's trying to purchase a conscience.
I ain't buying this Robin Hood bullshit.

25:51.583 --> 25:54.279
Oh shit, that's the kid I shot!

25:55.687 --> 25:59.350
Why don't you lose weight? You look
like a boiled yam wearing a belt!

26:10.635 --> 26:13.570
What's up, baby? Glad to see
somebody cares about the needy.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.467
Why don't you give me a turkey?

26:15.907 --> 26:20.844
Look at your funky black ass.
First you wanna be a stick-up kid.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.769
But then you got shot.
Now you's a basehead.

26:24.014 --> 26:26.039
You're messed up. Your life is crap.

26:26.550 --> 26:29.212
I know I look like stir-fried shit.

26:29.487 --> 26:31.614
Hook me up with some food.

26:31.822 --> 26:33.483
There's a line. You gotta wait.

26:34.158 --> 26:35.819
Give this man something to eat.

26:36.894 --> 26:38.725
Hook me up.

26:39.163 --> 26:40.391
This all I get?

26:40.998 --> 26:42.295
You want more?

26:43.167 --> 26:44.566
I'm a veteran.

26:45.736 --> 26:47.727
Here. How's that, all right?

26:49.740 --> 26:52.004
Clean yourself up,
maybe I'll give you a job.

26:52.209 --> 26:53.233
All right, man.

26:53.410 --> 26:54.741
Wanna buy a turkey?

26:55.079 --> 26:56.637
I'm gonna keep an eye on him.

27:00.417 --> 27:04.581
You don't deserve that turkey.
I hooked you up for that last get-high.

27:04.855 --> 27:07.085
Why I gotta be owing you?

27:07.591 --> 27:10.890
I was prom queen of King High School.

27:11.095 --> 27:12.892
This is beneath me.

27:15.366 --> 27:18.267
You were the prom queen.
Now you're the prom fiend.

27:18.536 --> 27:20.436
Look at you.

27:22.439 --> 27:23.701
Hey what?

27:24.041 --> 27:26.531
Didn't I hook you up?
Didn't I walk those 6 blocks...

27:26.709 --> 27:31.169
...to get that pipe from that Iranian
who tried to beat me out of $5?

27:31.948 --> 27:36.783
Didn't I speak to your mother after
the bitch called me a homeless bastard?

27:37.453 --> 27:38.681
Add all that up...

27:38.855 --> 27:43.019
...and the fact that I'm a man who can
beat your ass, I say it's my turkey.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.989
Get away! Get the fuck away!

27:48.565 --> 27:51.125
Stop beating on her! Stop it!

27:58.808 --> 28:00.435
Let go of me, man.

28:00.977 --> 28:05.573
You chump! Beat her up over a turkey.
You're a poor excuse for a brother.

28:05.815 --> 28:10.115
Shit, man! Fuck! Shit!
It's a cop! It's a cop!

28:11.821 --> 28:13.049
Shut up!

28:17.827 --> 28:20.159
Shut up or I'll blow your brains out.

28:21.097 --> 28:22.587
Don't hurt me.

28:22.832 --> 28:25.130
- Shut up!
- I know I was wrong to beat that girl.

28:25.335 --> 28:26.995
Crack has got me.

28:27.469 --> 28:30.700
I got no control over it.
I tried to kick...

28:30.906 --> 28:35.104
...but the shit be calling me.
It be calling me. I gotta go to it.

28:35.777 --> 28:37.904
- I need help, man.
- Come on, man.

28:42.951 --> 28:46.114
- We got a crack monster.
- Your mother's a monster.

28:46.822 --> 28:48.312
- Hold him.
- What you writing?

28:48.523 --> 28:52.015
"Pookie" Benny Robinson. Your name.

28:53.295 --> 28:57.163
- I'm trying to help you.
- You ain't helping nobody!

28:57.366 --> 28:59.391
- It's for your own good.
- Fuck you, man!

28:59.601 --> 29:01.933
- They'll hook you up.
- I'm gonna die!

29:04.172 --> 29:06.800
They're gonna help you.
They'll help you.

29:24.593 --> 29:27.528
I had pretty much
everything I ever wanted.

29:27.763 --> 29:29.697
Everything I thought I wanted.

29:30.197 --> 29:32.597
I always had a need for acceptance.

29:32.867 --> 29:34.994
All my friends were doing it.

29:35.202 --> 29:37.033
Thought I could quit anytime.

29:38.372 --> 29:40.533
That's when I woke up in the hospital.

29:41.942 --> 29:43.603
It's a very simple program.

29:43.878 --> 29:47.041
We only ask that you don't use
or drink one day at a time.

29:47.281 --> 29:49.943
Don't leave before the miracle happens.

29:52.119 --> 29:54.212
This program has revolving doors.

29:54.455 --> 29:58.448
But just because you go out,
don't mean you can come back in.

30:10.171 --> 30:12.162
It's crazy, because...

30:13.140 --> 30:17.406
...I did everything. I whored.
I ripped my family off.

30:17.645 --> 30:21.308
I was so scandalous,
I would even sell my baby's Pampers.

30:22.483 --> 30:24.314
I have a crack baby.

30:24.819 --> 30:26.753
He was born blind.

30:28.823 --> 30:32.088
I know why he's blind.
Everybody knows why he's blind.

30:32.493 --> 30:36.758
I kept telling myself I was
gonna kick, but I never did.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.820
I'm a junkie.

30:39.766 --> 30:41.427
I'll be one the rest of my life.

31:06.626 --> 31:09.459
It's the first time
I've ever been away for so long...

31:09.696 --> 31:12.961
...and personally, I hope I never see
you motherfuckers again.

31:13.900 --> 31:17.131
When I get out, I'll just take
everything one day at a time.

31:17.370 --> 31:18.860
One day at a time.

31:25.378 --> 31:29.644
Chill out. You been out two minutes
and already you want a job.

31:29.883 --> 31:33.478
It's not just a job. You saved my life.

31:33.720 --> 31:38.053
Let me pay you back.
Let me help you bring Nino down.

31:38.323 --> 31:42.657
He promised me a job.
I'll take his money and report to you.

31:42.895 --> 31:44.157
I don't know.

31:44.997 --> 31:48.160
You know what will happen
if I stay on the streets.

31:48.400 --> 31:53.235
I need to be a part of something.
If you don't believe in me, who will?

31:59.011 --> 32:02.469
<i>Cool. You've been inside,
checked out the operations.</i>

32:03.515 --> 32:06.678
All right, Pookie.
Parks, come help me out.

32:06.919 --> 32:08.910
Tell me what goes on in this dump.

32:09.188 --> 32:12.885
It took me a while,
but I've been through the whole joint.

32:13.091 --> 32:16.618
First, at the entrance, you gotta
show a membership card to this runner.

32:17.429 --> 32:18.862
<i>It's like a video club.</i>

32:19.097 --> 32:22.260
<i>Nino's got it hooked up
like Mission: Lmpossible.</i>

32:22.868 --> 32:26.065
<i>Walking through that courtyard's
like a nightmare.</i>

32:26.271 --> 32:28.535
<i>It's a nation full of zombies.</i>

32:38.216 --> 32:42.778
<i>You're escorted to the second floor where
a worker rings a buzzer and a code.</i>

32:43.054 --> 32:46.046
<i>A little panel on the wall opens up,
you get the crack.</i>

32:46.290 --> 32:48.383
<i>The code, the buzzer, where that go?</i>

32:48.626 --> 32:53.461
<i>The call goes to the "Drug Store"
where they make the crack.</i>

32:53.731 --> 32:58.668
<i>I heard they got everybody in there
butt naked. Titties hanging...</i>

32:58.870 --> 33:01.361
Nino don't trust a motherfucker.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.208
Nino's one sick genius.

33:10.414 --> 33:14.214
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
What happens at the Drug Store?

33:14.418 --> 33:18.047
After that, you can take your goodies
home or stay at the Enterprise.

33:18.589 --> 33:20.056
<i>What's the Enterprise?</i>

33:20.258 --> 33:22.453
<i>What am I, your ghetto tour guide?</i>

33:22.660 --> 33:25.493
<i>They got all this equipment
and you don't know shit.</i>

33:25.763 --> 33:29.893
<i>When you're smoking crack, they say
that you're "beaming up to Scotty."</i>

33:30.101 --> 33:32.069
<i>You're going to another world.</i>

33:32.270 --> 33:36.263
<i>Crack is the final frontier. That's why
they call that room the Enterprise.</i>

33:38.109 --> 33:42.272
<i>People sit down and light that
glass dick and take a hit.</i>

33:43.313 --> 33:48.250
<i>That's some scary shit. Their eyes look
like a rocket ready to blast off.</i>

33:48.852 --> 33:50.911
Nino has most of the apartments?

33:51.121 --> 33:55.251
Man, are you deaf, or what?
The boy controls the whole place.

33:55.458 --> 33:57.483
Nino Brown's a mad scientist.

33:57.694 --> 34:02.028
What did Marvin say? "The boy that
made slaves out of men"? That's Nino.

34:02.365 --> 34:03.923
That's deep.

34:09.940 --> 34:12.204
Happy New Year!

34:14.710 --> 34:18.976
Welcome to the Spotlite
with the Flavor Flav.

34:19.215 --> 34:21.409
Everybody say "Happy...

34:22.652 --> 34:24.380
...New Year!"

34:24.920 --> 34:26.388
The fruit of our hard work.

34:26.822 --> 34:29.882
The belief in the
entrepreneurial spirit.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.219
The new American Dream.

34:32.696 --> 34:33.924
A toast.

34:36.565 --> 34:39.694
A toast to my family, in life...

34:40.603 --> 34:42.036
...until death.

34:42.339 --> 34:43.737
Happy New Year.

34:46.909 --> 34:49.002
To CMB. On and on.

34:50.012 --> 34:52.913
- Am I my brother's keeper?
- Yes, I am!

34:53.181 --> 34:55.081
Am I my brother's keeper?

34:56.085 --> 34:58.349
Am I my brother's keeper?

35:01.256 --> 35:02.587
I am!

35:16.105 --> 35:17.333
Look at it.

35:18.707 --> 35:21.699
A big reason for this success is you.

35:22.544 --> 35:24.535
But this ain't about success.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.871
This is about survival.

35:27.116 --> 35:31.951
We ain't going out like Puss Head,
shot up over a $ 10 bag. You know?

35:32.421 --> 35:34.048
You gotta be smarter than that.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.455
We gotta look out for one another.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.951
I feel the same way.

35:41.330 --> 35:44.629
Nothing and no one
will come between you and me.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.533
Never. Right?

35:48.202 --> 35:49.692
I love you.

35:50.204 --> 35:51.762
I love you too.

35:53.441 --> 35:55.272
Let's go get busy.

35:59.447 --> 36:01.278
Frank Needles out here.

36:05.720 --> 36:06.948
Let him in.

36:12.627 --> 36:15.221
My ace-boon-coon!
How you doing?

36:15.630 --> 36:17.530
Happy New Year.
What's a matter...

36:17.732 --> 36:20.462
...too rich to toast the New Year
with an old friend now?

36:20.668 --> 36:24.263
If it isn't the thinking man's Rocky.
How are you doing?

36:24.472 --> 36:25.803
Great. Love the hair.

36:26.074 --> 36:30.477
The Don and I, we was thinking,
let's let bygones be bygones, all right?

36:30.745 --> 36:34.909
We congratulate you on your new success,
and as a show of our good faith...

36:35.450 --> 36:36.747
...a gift from the Don.

36:41.422 --> 36:42.889
Open it.

36:52.499 --> 36:54.558
<i>To the moolanyan in charge.</i>

36:54.768 --> 36:56.429
All the best, babe.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.677
You motherfucking creep!
Think you'll get away with that?

37:10.317 --> 37:11.545
I just did.

37:11.785 --> 37:13.412
Step the fuck off, Gigantor.

37:17.824 --> 37:22.488
Now get their silly, spaghetti-eating
asses out of my office.

37:24.764 --> 37:27.995
Frank, come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

37:46.119 --> 37:49.611
<i>It's total slamboyancy
in the Spotlite tonight.</i>

37:49.856 --> 37:54.451
You're about to get rocked by some
cool, mellow fellows from Brooklyn.

37:54.693 --> 37:59.596
I'm talking about Aaron, Damien,
Teddy, Slim, Guy.

37:59.999 --> 38:01.364
Give it up.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.567
Slim, give a little bit of bass.

39:19.577 --> 39:22.307
Gee Money, come here,
come here, come here.

39:23.581 --> 39:26.072
That the skeezer you met
at Frankie's strip joint?

39:26.317 --> 39:27.978
Yeah, Uniqua.

39:28.653 --> 39:31.918
What's up, brother?
You fucking her correctly, or what?

39:32.323 --> 39:36.259
Once, but I just met her. You know,
I need time to get to know her.

39:37.595 --> 39:38.926
I heard that.

39:40.932 --> 39:42.661
Lord, have mercy.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.899
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>

39:51.776 --> 39:53.903
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

40:03.854 --> 40:05.617
The world is mine.

40:05.856 --> 40:08.347
And the brothers too, now.
Don't forget us.

40:08.625 --> 40:11.116
The world is yours, Nino.

40:11.361 --> 40:15.855
Only you won't be as careless
as Tony Montana, now will you?

40:16.133 --> 40:17.930
You absolutely right.

40:18.135 --> 40:20.035
I like this girl of yours.

40:20.304 --> 40:22.738
He ain't got no papers
or a leash on me.

40:22.939 --> 40:25.874
You know what happens
when dogs don't have a leash.

40:26.643 --> 40:29.441
They run the streets
and fuck everything in sight.

40:34.151 --> 40:37.643
It's true. I ain't got no papers
or no leash on her.

40:37.888 --> 40:39.549
But nothing comes between us.

40:39.823 --> 40:41.882
The world is mine!

40:42.159 --> 40:43.820
All mine!

40:44.728 --> 40:46.696
What the fuck are you doing up there?

40:47.331 --> 40:50.129
A man like you, Nino,
needs to leave a legacy.

40:50.334 --> 40:54.236
A son. A mark to let the world know
that he was here.

40:58.508 --> 41:00.169
You know, you absolutely right.

41:00.409 --> 41:03.503
Shit. It ain't like I ain't
been trying. Ain't that right?

41:06.382 --> 41:07.610
She can't have kids.

41:08.584 --> 41:10.211
She can't fuck, either.

41:10.419 --> 41:12.649
Maybe that's why
she can't have no kids.

41:12.855 --> 41:15.585
That ain't right, man.
That ain't right.

41:16.692 --> 41:19.024
- She can't?
- She can't.

41:20.596 --> 41:23.929
- Too bad.
- You're goddamn right that's too bad.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.745
Nino, you need to go get your girl.

41:47.256 --> 41:49.417
You're right. I tell you what.

41:53.963 --> 41:57.057
If I was you, I'd be looking
for the pimples on her booty.

41:59.802 --> 42:02.066
Why the fuck did you have
to say that shit?

42:02.304 --> 42:04.897
I told you before she couldn't
make no babies!

42:08.410 --> 42:09.968
I love you!

42:10.478 --> 42:13.572
And now you're taking me for granted.
How can you do that?

42:13.815 --> 42:16.249
This is corny!
This is soap-opera shit!

42:16.418 --> 42:18.443
- You act like I owe you something.
- You do.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.417
I don't owe you jack.

42:20.822 --> 42:24.314
Okay, you did give me
a couple of books to read.

42:24.592 --> 42:28.653
And helped me build the brothers. But I
was your ticket out of a boring life...

42:28.997 --> 42:33.127
...when your rich doctor daddy was
making house calls at Harlem General.

42:33.334 --> 42:35.325
What's up with that? Right?

42:35.603 --> 42:40.438
When your kleptomaniac mother
was housing shit in Bloomingdales.

42:40.842 --> 42:42.776
Don't throw no shit in my face...

42:43.011 --> 42:44.842
You ever touch me again, I'll...

43:16.710 --> 43:18.974
Yeah, I'm aware of that situation.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.113
<i>Stone, your man hired an ex-dealer.</i>

43:21.315 --> 43:25.809
I know it seems a little unconventional.
Appleton and Peretti report to me.

43:26.053 --> 43:27.884
<i>- Is it out of control?
- Don't worry.</i>

43:28.155 --> 43:29.486
<i>Don't blow this.</i>

43:29.823 --> 43:32.758
<i>- Does the Commissioner know about this?
- No, not yet.</i>

43:32.960 --> 43:34.188
Good.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.732
I told you about that new-jack-cop shit.

43:43.003 --> 43:47.565
I give you a chance and you hire a
notorious crackhead. What's with you?

43:47.841 --> 43:50.002
Why don't you get off my dick?

43:50.244 --> 43:53.907
When you're ready to put your sideline
ass on the frontline, let me know.

43:54.681 --> 43:57.013
Excuse me. Is this
some kind of black thing?

43:57.217 --> 44:00.345
Yes, it is, so keep your
toy Mafia butt out of it!

44:00.687 --> 44:04.350
Fuck the Mafia! I'm gonna wax
your high-yellow, narrow-ass butt!

44:06.159 --> 44:08.752
Cool it! Relax, all right?

44:09.028 --> 44:12.225
If you won't handle this,
why don't you send the white boy...

44:12.431 --> 44:14.695
...inside The Carter with
the National Guard?

44:17.870 --> 44:20.771
What we need is a videotape
of this whole operation.

44:21.040 --> 44:24.203
We need evidence of the
financial records to make it work.

44:25.545 --> 44:28.275
I work there. I'm the lookout from
7 p.m. To 7 a. M...

44:28.481 --> 44:30.711
...in one of the apartment windows.

44:30.950 --> 44:34.113
I had to fill out an application.
They asked if I still got high.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.151
They remember me from before.

44:36.355 --> 44:40.257
Because I was one of their first loyal
customers. I used to get fucked up.

44:40.459 --> 44:41.949
Cracker barrel, cracker ass.

44:43.563 --> 44:45.224
I got it, I got it.

44:54.407 --> 44:56.398
This belt is really a video camera.

44:56.909 --> 45:00.106
These wire transmitters will be
taped to you for sound.

45:00.313 --> 45:04.977
It'll send your communication to us,
as well as sounds and images around you.

45:05.251 --> 45:07.651
It will also pick up
shit you can't even hear.

45:08.588 --> 45:11.283
You'll be great.
You're the best man for this job.

45:11.523 --> 45:12.990
You're a fucking genius.

45:13.191 --> 45:14.419
Your mother.

45:15.427 --> 45:17.156
Pookie, we're counting on you.

45:17.829 --> 45:20.389
You can help us bring down CMB.

45:22.167 --> 45:23.600
Try this on.

45:24.669 --> 45:27.263
- You with it?
- I'm with it, man.

45:28.773 --> 45:31.833
Let's roll with it. Put it on.

45:50.729 --> 45:53.357
<i>Pookie, come here, man.
Come here.</i>

45:53.765 --> 45:56.131
<i>You know, I told Gee Money
how good you been.</i>

45:56.968 --> 45:59.869
<i>How you've been bringing in
lots of customers.</i>

46:00.872 --> 46:02.533
<i>And you're just a lookout.</i>

46:03.208 --> 46:06.200
<i>Anything that makes them
more money they like.</i>

46:06.444 --> 46:07.672
This might be it.

46:07.879 --> 46:09.471
<i>We're promoting you.</i>

46:09.814 --> 46:11.042
Check it out.

46:14.418 --> 46:16.147
<i>Soon. Let's get going with it.</i>

46:16.487 --> 46:17.818
Jackpot! System!

46:18.055 --> 46:19.886
He's inside! Yes!

46:20.557 --> 46:22.991
This kid's been bringing us
a lot of business.

46:23.327 --> 46:26.296
<i>I'd like to take a shot
at one of those computer terminals.</i>

46:26.497 --> 46:29.898
<i>- Can you program PASCAL?
- Can a white man dance?</i>

46:30.234 --> 46:32.930
<i>I guess not. But people change,
they lose interest.</i>

46:33.137 --> 46:36.402
<i>Today's your lucky day, homeboy.
I'm promoting your ass.</i>

46:38.108 --> 46:39.473
<i>You still on the pipe?</i>

46:39.677 --> 46:40.974
<i>No way.</i>

46:41.178 --> 46:44.841
<i>Good. Real good. Because you'll be
working in the Drug Store.</i>

46:45.049 --> 46:47.244
I'm glad you got confidence in me.

46:47.518 --> 46:48.849
See you.

46:51.755 --> 46:54.155
- Keep an eye on that kid.
- Why? What's wrong?

46:54.358 --> 46:56.918
He's light-fingered.
Keep an eye on the product.

46:59.863 --> 47:03.355
I don't think Pookie's ready
to be in a room full of crack.

47:03.600 --> 47:06.933
I'm ready. Don't I look ready now?
I was born ready.

47:07.204 --> 47:09.934
- Ready to die.
- Stay out of this.

47:13.377 --> 47:15.971
He's already on the inside.
With a little more time...

47:16.180 --> 47:19.546
...we'll have enough information
to put Nino away for good.

47:19.782 --> 47:21.374
In my opinion, we get him out...

47:21.584 --> 47:23.552
If I want your opinion, I'll give it.

47:25.621 --> 47:26.952
I'm against it.

47:27.657 --> 47:30.125
- But it's your call.
- And your funeral.

47:38.234 --> 47:40.225
We told them, man.

47:41.237 --> 47:42.966
Ready? Shit.

47:43.740 --> 47:47.574
You better be ready,
because you owe a lot of people.

47:47.810 --> 47:50.301
You owe me. You owe yourself.

47:50.747 --> 47:52.874
You owe the whole community.

47:53.082 --> 47:56.142
You even owe my mother.
Yeah, that's right.

47:56.419 --> 47:59.115
A junkie just like you
killed my mother in 1974.

47:59.322 --> 48:02.086
Didn't take money or jewelry.

48:03.159 --> 48:04.990
Just took her life.

48:05.261 --> 48:09.425
I don't know what you got left in your
so-called rehabilitated body.

48:09.665 --> 48:13.260
But you better find something
because you owe a lot of people.

48:13.503 --> 48:16.097
A lot of people. You owe, Pook.

49:34.748 --> 49:36.511
You got skim milk in them titties?

49:40.087 --> 49:43.022
One and a-two and a-three and a-four...

49:43.224 --> 49:45.749
<i>I'll give you something to look at.</i>

49:46.560 --> 49:50.519
Superfly, there's something wrong
with your boy.

49:51.365 --> 49:53.265
What's happening with Pookie?

49:55.069 --> 49:58.266
- I have no idea.
- You should, he's your plant.

49:58.539 --> 50:01.201
Cool out. You're jumping the gun.

50:01.542 --> 50:03.533
But something's wrong with your guy.

50:03.777 --> 50:05.677
<i>"Ocho dÃ©cadas y siete aÃ±os..."</i>

50:05.880 --> 50:08.713
- Is that a secret code for help?
- No, it's a black thing.

50:08.949 --> 50:11.816
I'm tired of your stuff.
I'm tired of this dude.

50:11.986 --> 50:13.214
<i>What's wrong, fool?</i>

50:13.387 --> 50:18.051
<i>Just doing a workout. This is
a tough job. Gotta stay in shape.</i>

50:19.059 --> 50:21.220
A workout like this
boosts worker morale.

50:21.562 --> 50:22.790
You think I'm stupid.

50:23.297 --> 50:25.060
You're a high motherfucker.

50:27.734 --> 50:28.701
<i>You 5-0?</i>

50:28.868 --> 50:30.893
- Shit! His cover's blown!
- Let's go!

50:32.138 --> 50:33.799
Are you 5-0?!

50:35.208 --> 50:36.436
<i>Take him outside...</i>

50:36.609 --> 50:38.474
<i>... and kill him!
And blow the building!</i>

50:38.978 --> 50:40.707
<i>Help me! I'm gonna die!</i>

50:40.980 --> 50:42.379
Let's go!

51:03.436 --> 51:04.801
Let's go!

51:31.863 --> 51:33.558
Let me through!
I'll do the bitch!

51:50.749 --> 51:51.977
Clear!

52:06.732 --> 52:09.223
Police! Get out! Come on!

52:23.849 --> 52:26.409
- Nothing here!
- Let's get out of here!

52:36.761 --> 52:39.252
Come here. Hold on.
Keep your head down.

52:52.543 --> 52:54.010
Scotty!

52:54.779 --> 52:56.337
Where the hell are you?

53:04.121 --> 53:05.349
Touch him, it blows.

53:05.556 --> 53:07.285
- Do this.
- There's too many wires.

53:07.558 --> 53:08.786
Pick one.

53:09.393 --> 53:10.690
Come on!

53:10.928 --> 53:13.123
Light! I can't see! Give me a light!

53:13.531 --> 53:16.261
Hold it there. Scotty, on three...

53:16.467 --> 53:19.800
...I want you to slowly,
gently pull out the blue wire.

53:23.941 --> 53:26.705
One, two, three.

53:32.349 --> 53:34.316
- One's the ground.
- Which?

53:34.584 --> 53:36.279
- I don't know!
- 3 seconds left!

54:24.534 --> 54:28.197
I knew it! You ain't nothing
but a high-priced ho.

54:28.638 --> 54:30.538
<i>Put Nino on, bitch.</i>

54:31.141 --> 54:32.631
It's for you.

54:37.713 --> 54:39.180
What's up?

54:39.381 --> 54:42.714
<i>I know you're having a good time,
but we were infiltrated.</i>

54:44.887 --> 54:46.218
We shut down The Carter.

54:47.322 --> 54:48.983
Get your ass out here right now!

54:49.558 --> 54:50.786
<i>Now!</i>

54:56.832 --> 54:58.060
Stop!

55:11.346 --> 55:12.574
What happened?

55:16.351 --> 55:17.978
Don't nobody know nothing?

55:18.187 --> 55:20.417
Don't everybody speak at once.

55:21.757 --> 55:23.691
How the motherfucker get in?

55:26.428 --> 55:30.421
Out of all you motherfuckers,
nobody knows jack shit?

55:34.603 --> 55:37.436
The Duh Duh Man.
Duh Duh, what happened?

55:43.544 --> 55:45.375
I'll be a motherfucker.

55:45.713 --> 55:47.874
Don't nobody know nothing?

55:49.050 --> 55:50.381
What up with this?

55:52.119 --> 55:54.883
Somebody got to know something
was going on.

55:55.122 --> 55:56.453
See what I'm saying?

55:57.058 --> 55:58.616
Ain't that right, Gee Money?

55:59.393 --> 56:02.123
I think Gee Money definitely
knows something.

56:02.697 --> 56:04.289
Gee Money knows something.

56:06.901 --> 56:10.234
You fucked up. You fucked up bigtime.

56:10.638 --> 56:13.072
You're incapable of running this shit.

56:13.407 --> 56:16.399
Sit your five-dollar ass down
before I make change.

56:17.979 --> 56:20.140
Kareem brought him to my attention.

56:20.748 --> 56:22.375
We got 300 employees.

56:22.583 --> 56:25.814
I can't keep my eye on all of them.

56:27.655 --> 56:29.384
If you was taking care of business...

56:29.590 --> 56:32.616
what? If I was what?
Say it again!

56:32.827 --> 56:34.294
What?!

56:35.396 --> 56:36.385
Nothing.

56:36.597 --> 56:40.397
That's what I thought you said.
Because that's what I got, nothing!

56:40.601 --> 56:43.831
A million-dollar-a-week business
reduced to rubbish!

56:49.276 --> 56:50.641
It's your responsibility.

56:59.686 --> 57:02.849
I never liked you anyway,
pretty motherfucker.

57:14.534 --> 57:18.129
What's the matter, Gee?
What's up with you?

57:18.805 --> 57:23.640
Why are you letting some shit like who
I'm laying the pipe to fuck with you?

57:23.877 --> 57:25.538
You're bigger than that.

57:27.480 --> 57:31.143
Something like this
can never happen again.

57:54.740 --> 57:55.968
Now...

57:58.677 --> 58:00.076
...leave me.

58:02.247 --> 58:04.181
Get the fuck out.

58:33.779 --> 58:36.043
What Gee Money has brought together...

58:36.548 --> 58:38.539
...let no man put asunder.

58:39.618 --> 58:41.779
I now pronounce us man...

58:42.121 --> 58:43.452
...and wife.

58:45.724 --> 58:47.281
You may kiss the bride.

58:53.898 --> 58:58.232
Be not deceived.
Neither fornicators, nor idolaters...

58:58.469 --> 59:02.166
...nor adulterers, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind...

59:02.373 --> 59:04.807
...shall inherit the kingdom of God.

59:05.410 --> 59:07.810
May your soul rest in peace.

59:08.246 --> 59:09.645
Goodbye, Pookie.

59:20.425 --> 59:22.757
The Commissioner's been
on my ass all night.

59:23.161 --> 59:27.996
Washington is blaming us for losing
thousands of dollars in man-hours.

59:28.766 --> 59:30.996
Not to mention all the cops
we got killed.

59:32.270 --> 59:34.329
The operation was a failure.

59:35.273 --> 59:37.503
We didn't arrest anyone.
No one, man.

59:38.342 --> 59:42.438
We didn't get any evidence. Nothing.
No financial records, nothing.

59:43.514 --> 59:46.847
We still could be out there
fighting scum like Nino Brown...

59:47.118 --> 59:48.847
...except for two things:

59:52.456 --> 59:56.586
I gambled on you,
and you gambled on a crackhead.

59:57.027 --> 59:59.495
- Fuck that!
- That's enough, man!

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:05.526
I'm sorry you lost your budget.
But I lost a friend.

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:12.531
Let it go. Operation's over.

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.442
It's over.

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:25.043
It ain't over.
Pookie didn't die for nothing.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:30.050
<i>Operation's gone...</i>

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:33.190
...Nino's loose, Pookie is dead.

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.296
I got Pookie killed.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:39.162
Cut out this self-pitying shit
about you killing Pookie.

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:42.235
If anyone killed him it was me.
I could see it.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:45.405
How you gonna tell me
you killed Pookie?

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.745
Do you remember
when you said I didn't care?

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:56.913
When what the hell was I doing
at Pookie's funeral anyway? Remember?

01:00:59.855 --> 01:01:01.652
I used to be Pookie.

01:01:01.857 --> 01:01:04.348
How the hell you used to be Pookie?

01:01:04.593 --> 01:01:06.857
I was a poor white-trash Pookie.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:11.223
This whole drug shit, it's not
a black thing, it's not a white thing.

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.264
It's a death thing.
Death doesn't give a shit about color.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:18.840
You don't have to like me.

01:01:19.441 --> 01:01:21.534
I don't even know if I like you.

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:27.106
But we're in this together now, partner.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:32.214
You know, a drug dealer
is the worst kind of brother.

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:36.680
He won't sell it to his sister.
He won't sell it to his mother.

01:01:36.892 --> 01:01:39.224
But he'll sell it
to his boys in the street.

01:01:40.462 --> 01:01:42.123
I don't know about you...

01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:45.896
...but I'm ready to kill Nino Brown.

01:01:46.802 --> 01:01:48.292
Are you with me?

01:01:50.072 --> 01:01:51.562
I'm ahead of you.

01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:08.720
Behind door number one,
your head explodes like a melon.

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:13.793
Behind door two, you hook us up with
Gee Money and get the prize, Nino Brown.

01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:16.957
Let's make a deal.

01:02:19.734 --> 01:02:23.727
You and me always had an understanding.
Besides, I needed a haircut, right?

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:31.244
<i>My cugino and his friend are hungry.</i>

01:02:32.246 --> 01:02:35.409
And I got a feeling
that they can cut you a sweeter deal...

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:37.311
...than any Peruvian.

01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:40.145
Enough to maybe throw in
a finder's fee for me.

01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:45.792
If I swim with this offer...

01:02:46.027 --> 01:02:50.623
You wanted to meet the main man, that's
done. From now on you deal with me...

01:02:50.898 --> 01:02:52.229
...and me only.

01:03:07.948 --> 01:03:10.041
You will cut me a side deal.

01:03:10.417 --> 01:03:11.748
Twenty percent.

01:03:12.519 --> 01:03:15.010
And you will be obligated
to report to me...

01:03:15.355 --> 01:03:16.754
...and me only.

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:20.350
Give me your number.

01:03:46.486 --> 01:03:47.714
Don Armeteo.

01:03:48.655 --> 01:03:50.555
Nino is about to itch.

01:03:53.627 --> 01:03:57.393
- What the fuck is up?
- What's up? Play ball, that's what.

01:03:58.398 --> 01:03:59.865
Check!

01:04:07.573 --> 01:04:08.801
Can I help you?

01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:10.441
I'm here to see Gee Money.

01:04:11.277 --> 01:04:13.268
- What's up with these elbows?
- Sucker!

01:04:13.579 --> 01:04:14.876
I don't know you.

01:04:15.915 --> 01:04:17.143
You know him?

01:04:17.316 --> 01:04:19.978
Hold up. I know him. He's cool.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.318
Ease back, playboy. Ease back.

01:04:24.156 --> 01:04:27.091
How you feeling, Gee Money, my man?

01:04:29.428 --> 01:04:31.259
What's up with your man?

01:04:33.499 --> 01:04:34.727
Pat him down.

01:04:35.634 --> 01:04:36.862
Pat him down!

01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:40.494
It's like that?

01:04:42.475 --> 01:04:43.965
What the fuck is this?

01:04:44.176 --> 01:04:46.406
I don't know you, that's what.

01:04:47.113 --> 01:04:49.274
I know you're my man's new contact...

01:04:49.615 --> 01:04:51.139
...but I don't trust you.

01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:54.251
So since you're interrupting my game,
get the fuck out.

01:04:59.925 --> 01:05:00.914
Mr. Money?

01:05:01.193 --> 01:05:04.628
Please escort Mr. Washington
off the court. Take him down the block.

01:05:04.863 --> 01:05:07.764
And if this dreadlocked
boomboorah even blinks wrong...

01:05:07.966 --> 01:05:09.763
...you lullaby his ass.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.600
Don't forget what we talked about
before at Frankie's.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:21.142
I'm definitely gonna be the next king.

01:05:22.313 --> 01:05:25.043
Yo, Keish, I seen that boy
somewhere before.

01:05:30.321 --> 01:05:34.724
That's right, I checked him out myself.
He cooler than a fan.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.221
And the product is 60 percent cheaper
than what the brothers is paying now.

01:05:39.831 --> 01:05:42.959
<i>That will free up
a whole lot of money...</i>

01:05:43.201 --> 01:05:45.169
<i>... to do a lot of other things.</i>

01:05:45.837 --> 01:05:48.135
Like, maybe take over
another city project?

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.731
<i>All right, let's roll with it.</i>

01:05:51.009 --> 01:05:53.170
<i>We build and get stronger.</i>

01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:55.504
Most definite. Most definite.

01:05:55.747 --> 01:05:57.544
<i>Money, I'll tell you something.</i>

01:05:57.916 --> 01:05:59.907
If he's not who he says he is...

01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:01.741
...l'll kill him.

01:06:02.854 --> 01:06:04.321
Then I'll kill you.

01:06:09.293 --> 01:06:13.423
<i>I don't trust Mr. Washington. So I want
him to stick to me like flies to shit.</i>

01:06:17.334 --> 01:06:20.770
When I was young, I was a member
of this gang called the L.A. Boys.

01:06:21.038 --> 01:06:22.369
- Lennox Ave.
- You know it.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.207
The leader, Jughead, told me to prove
my loyalty, I had to snuff somebody out.

01:06:29.546 --> 01:06:31.207
It was like, "No problem."

01:06:31.448 --> 01:06:35.043
I said, "An enemy?"
He said, "No, that's too easy."

01:06:35.285 --> 01:06:37.116
"It's got to be an ordinary mo."

01:06:38.222 --> 01:06:39.951
So I rode down to 23rd.

01:06:40.224 --> 01:06:43.625
Copped me a bag of that
Red Devil angel dust.

01:06:48.565 --> 01:06:50.465
I got so zooted.

01:06:52.302 --> 01:06:56.261
I walked up on this lady. She must have
been a schoolteacher or something.

01:06:56.573 --> 01:06:59.565
I was so fucking crazy, man,
I didn't even care.

01:07:00.978 --> 01:07:02.570
I stepped to her.

01:07:08.318 --> 01:07:10.410
I didn't even stay to see her body drop.

01:07:11.087 --> 01:07:12.577
I just ran.

01:07:15.324 --> 01:07:17.087
You must think I'm a demon.

01:07:19.595 --> 01:07:21.586
I guess what you was doing...

01:07:22.765 --> 01:07:25.256
...it was like business, right?

01:07:26.502 --> 01:07:27.764
It wasn't personal.

01:07:28.604 --> 01:07:29.832
My brother...

01:07:31.007 --> 01:07:32.668
...it's always business.

01:07:33.509 --> 01:07:34.908
Never personal.

01:07:38.014 --> 01:07:41.347
- Tell your moms I want some bean pies.
- Can I get some?

01:07:41.617 --> 01:07:43.107
Come on in, little man.

01:07:47.523 --> 01:07:49.013
Two for you.

01:07:54.297 --> 01:07:55.525
Two for you.

01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:00.667
- Hold up, pop.
- Get your butt out of here, now.

01:08:05.641 --> 01:08:07.472
I can take care of you too, old man.

01:08:07.677 --> 01:08:11.204
You better take care of yourself,
because you an ignorant bastard.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.338
You committing genocide on your people
with these silk suits and fancy cars.

01:08:15.517 --> 01:08:16.881
Step off, grandpa.

01:08:18.787 --> 01:08:20.015
Idol worshiper.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.657
You killing your own people with the
white devils you put in that bottle.

01:08:23.858 --> 01:08:25.689
You an idolater.

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:28.020
Reverend Oates,
why are you with this scum?

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.892
Shut up!
Nino, let me smoke this old dude.

01:08:39.307 --> 01:08:40.535
Look at you.

01:08:40.942 --> 01:08:43.466
In two years, they'll be
marking your gravesite.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:46.679
Me? I'll be right here.

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:50.818
All you kids,
get out of here!

01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:57.421
These kids...

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:02.658
...all these people
gather around you like you God Almighty.

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:04.587
Like you love them.

01:09:04.866 --> 01:09:06.390
Devils ain't got no love.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.932
You're killing your people.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.930
What can you offer them?

01:09:10.205 --> 01:09:11.934
Another "I have a dream" speech?

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.935
Some of that same shit
you ripping off to me?

01:09:15.475 --> 01:09:19.104
Look where we at. Not a pot to piss in,
nor a window to throw it out of.

01:09:19.513 --> 01:09:20.912
You's the fool, old man.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.609
Don't try it, old man.
Don't even think about.

01:09:32.826 --> 01:09:34.384
You don't understand, do you?

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:39.630
Idolater, you reap what you sow!

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:59.748
This is some fly shit.

01:10:00.087 --> 01:10:03.887
Some George Raft- some
James Cagney-type shit.

01:10:04.091 --> 01:10:05.456
You know what I'm saying?

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:08.253
- That's how you living, baby.
- Living large, brother.

01:10:14.668 --> 01:10:17.501
Good looking out this afternoon
with that madness.

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:20.068
Gee Money should've seen it coming.

01:10:22.508 --> 01:10:24.499
Old man really wanted to do me,
didn't he?

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.408
Old bastard.

01:10:29.782 --> 01:10:32.512
But here's something
you might not find so funny.

01:10:32.952 --> 01:10:35.853
Your boy Gee Money tried to cut
a side deal with me.

01:10:41.627 --> 01:10:44.118
You can't trust anybody these days.

01:10:45.031 --> 01:10:48.023
You can trust me. I got your back.

01:10:52.338 --> 01:10:53.600
Thank you.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.703
Now Reverend Oates will say
a few words to the happy couple.

01:11:04.217 --> 01:11:07.778
You gotta wait till somebody else
gets some too, okay?

01:11:11.324 --> 01:11:14.384
Before we eat up all this cake,
we ought to give a toast...

01:11:14.894 --> 01:11:18.455
...to my daughter, my new son-in-law
and our gracious host...

01:11:18.664 --> 01:11:20.063
...Mr. Nino Brown.

01:12:43.948 --> 01:12:45.575
I got something for you.

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:48.982
That's my business card.
Call me sometime.

01:13:30.693 --> 01:13:33.355
Hey, what's up? You still mad at me?

01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:35.029
Fuck you, then.

01:13:35.798 --> 01:13:39.632
- Where is the Duh Duh Man?
- Probably after that skeezer he was on.

01:13:40.303 --> 01:13:41.634
What's up with Selina?

01:13:41.871 --> 01:13:44.305
I don't know. Losing her mind,
that's what's up.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.100
You think I care?
This is my world, my money...

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:48.641
...and that's my skeezer.

01:13:54.484 --> 01:13:55.712
Hi, Daddy.

01:14:06.829 --> 01:14:08.387
Thank you, mister.

01:14:16.806 --> 01:14:18.034
Cover me!

01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:38.855
Throw me a gun!

01:14:40.162 --> 01:14:41.390
Get down!

01:14:53.942 --> 01:14:55.204
Motherfuckers!

01:15:34.081 --> 01:15:36.140
You're a murderer, Nino!

01:15:36.917 --> 01:15:39.818
I've seen you kill too many people!

01:15:42.323 --> 01:15:43.813
Cancel that bitch.

01:15:44.258 --> 01:15:45.816
I'll buy another one.

01:15:48.996 --> 01:15:50.429
I hate you!

01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:52.931
I hate you, Nino!

01:15:56.003 --> 01:15:57.994
Don Armeteo's on the phone for you.

01:16:01.275 --> 01:16:04.244
We made you. We gave you everything.

01:16:04.445 --> 01:16:08.848
Shagazzy's, the Spotlite,
the street corners.

01:16:10.518 --> 01:16:13.817
So you got cute.
You had to get spanked.

01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:16.615
Now you listen to me. I made this. Me.

01:16:16.924 --> 01:16:19.586
I own this city, you slicked-back,
greasy-haired...

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:20.920
<i>... son of a bitch!</i>

01:16:21.095 --> 01:16:22.460
You're fucked!

01:17:02.235 --> 01:17:03.725
<i>This bulletin just in.</i>

01:17:04.003 --> 01:17:07.632
<i>In a scene to rival the famed
St. Valentine's Day Massacre...</i>

01:17:07.841 --> 01:17:09.570
<i>... of 1920's Chicago...</i>

01:17:09.843 --> 01:17:14.041
<i>... Don Armeteo, reputed crime lord,
and 10 of his henchmen...</i>

01:17:14.247 --> 01:17:16.511
<i>... were gunned down this afternoon...</i>

01:17:16.749 --> 01:17:19.684
<i>I put you two together.
And you guys go off on your own...</i>

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:21.410
...and now you wanna come back.

01:17:21.588 --> 01:17:23.988
You're telling me the disk I took
isn't important?

01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:27.182
I'm telling you,
I hope it is important.

01:17:28.094 --> 01:17:32.030
This is Hawkins. We go back to law school.
She's the prosecuting attorney.

01:17:33.099 --> 01:17:36.091
The son of a bitch used a little girl
as a bulletproof vest.

01:17:36.369 --> 01:17:39.166
Watch your language.
Nino is gonna fall.

01:17:39.404 --> 01:17:42.840
- What about the Pookie video?
- It helps, but it's not enough.

01:17:43.108 --> 01:17:45.508
Nino isn't in any of the tapes
at The Carter.

01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:47.406
He's becoming Mr. Untouchable.

01:17:49.548 --> 01:17:52.949
How many more gotta get killed?
I could have smoked this fool myself.

01:17:53.218 --> 01:17:56.847
Can we catch him in a drug buy?
Or get a witness who will testify...

01:17:57.122 --> 01:17:58.714
...to connect all the dots?

01:17:58.957 --> 01:18:03.792
Nino's got great connections. Can we
nail any of them and tie them to Nino?

01:18:04.396 --> 01:18:05.886
Check this out.

01:18:06.398 --> 01:18:09.765
We got it set up so the
CMB brothers will buy from us.

01:18:10.469 --> 01:18:13.927
And I also got it so Nino Brown
definitely doesn't trust Gee Money.

01:18:14.139 --> 01:18:16.130
And we'll get it on videotape.

01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:40.262
What's up, fellows?

01:18:40.831 --> 01:18:42.093
Got the bucks?

01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:45.097
So nice of you to make it.
Know what I'm saying?

01:18:45.503 --> 01:18:47.266
What can I say?

01:18:47.672 --> 01:18:49.299
What's taking him so long?

01:18:49.774 --> 01:18:51.469
Nino's not moving. Shit.

01:18:51.676 --> 01:18:54.236
- Let's do this.
- Open the briefcase.

01:18:58.816 --> 01:19:00.044
Easy.

01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:01.746
Very easy.

01:19:01.953 --> 01:19:03.352
I thought we was friends.

01:19:03.621 --> 01:19:06.283
I told you, it's never personal, B.

01:19:06.524 --> 01:19:09.288
Friends is friends. This is business.

01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:12.189
- Let's see the sample.
- Whatever.

01:19:19.537 --> 01:19:20.834
All here, baby.

01:19:21.305 --> 01:19:23.830
I knew I knew washington. He's 5-0.

01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:27.670
Suck-ass motherfucker.

01:19:30.414 --> 01:19:32.211
Punch it! Just do it!

01:22:54.848 --> 01:22:57.146
You cut a side deal
with that motherfucker.

01:22:58.418 --> 01:23:01.012
Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Gee.

01:23:02.589 --> 01:23:04.056
Fucking Cain.

01:23:05.158 --> 01:23:06.853
My brother's keeper.

01:23:08.094 --> 01:23:09.584
Was it this...

01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:13.024
...glass dick you've been sucking on?

01:23:15.202 --> 01:23:19.104
Was that it? Now I see how
you let that motherfucker infiltrate.

01:23:19.773 --> 01:23:21.536
He used you, Gee.

01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:34.247
What ever happened to,
"Am I my brother's keeper?"

01:23:35.388 --> 01:23:37.049
You know what happened to it.

01:23:39.893 --> 01:23:41.884
"The world is mine."

01:23:44.631 --> 01:23:46.223
Remember that?

01:23:47.667 --> 01:23:51.125
"Everything is mine. Everything!"

01:23:52.472 --> 01:23:53.961
Even my woman.

01:23:54.974 --> 01:23:56.908
Is that what this is about?

01:23:57.142 --> 01:23:58.575
That fucking skeezer?

01:23:58.811 --> 01:24:00.472
You think I give a fuck about her?

01:24:00.679 --> 01:24:03.375
Fuck that ho bitch!
I don't give a fuck about her!

01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:05.640
It ain't about her.

01:24:07.253 --> 01:24:08.743
It's about us.

01:24:12.825 --> 01:24:14.258
I love you, man.

01:24:22.001 --> 01:24:24.094
You embarrassed me, man!

01:24:27.273 --> 01:24:30.367
In front of all them people,
you treated me like I was soft.

01:24:30.576 --> 01:24:32.942
You treated me like I was spineless!

01:24:34.179 --> 01:24:38.115
We built this shit!
You didn't do this shit by yourself!

01:24:39.351 --> 01:24:42.684
You forgot about me, man, your brother.

01:24:44.123 --> 01:24:45.852
What has this done to us?

01:24:50.029 --> 01:24:51.257
Keisha...

01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:52.858
...dead.

01:24:53.866 --> 01:24:55.299
The Duh Duh Man...

01:24:55.834 --> 01:24:57.061
...dead.

01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:01.429
Let's just make it like it was.

01:25:02.807 --> 01:25:05.708
Let's be a family.
Let's make it like it was.

01:25:05.977 --> 01:25:09.538
Fuck them cars and
them bitches and all that shit.

01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:11.805
Fuck that shit!

01:25:13.318 --> 01:25:16.344
Let's do us, me and you.
Let's be a family again.

01:25:28.232 --> 01:25:29.995
I'm on the run.

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:34.231
It can never go back the way it was.

01:25:38.009 --> 01:25:42.173
But I'll tell you how
we can make it right.

01:25:53.424 --> 01:25:54.755
CMB.

01:25:55.593 --> 01:25:56.924
CMB!

01:25:57.362 --> 01:25:58.920
We all we got.

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:04.356
Am I my brother's keeper?

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:14.707
Yes, I am.

01:26:25.322 --> 01:26:27.381
You know where Nino Brown lives?

01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:30.225
You heard my man.
I ain't telling you shit.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.723
Last summer, me and my boys won
this basketball tournament.

01:26:33.964 --> 01:26:37.491
Bought the whole team brand-new
red scooters. So you can kiss my ass.

01:26:37.667 --> 01:26:38.895
Kiss my ass with that.

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:43.199
You know something, B?
This dude is a cop. 5-0! B, out!

01:26:43.807 --> 01:26:45.365
Come here, punk!

01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:48.905
I know where Nino lives.

01:26:49.212 --> 01:26:51.976
He beat this kid who
scrambled for him with a bat.

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:54.547
Poured gas on him and set him on fire...

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:57.250
...after he shorted him $5.

01:26:57.487 --> 01:27:00.149
I hope you kill his black, hardened ass.

01:27:00.991 --> 01:27:02.821
He's in apartment 6C.

01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:05.822
But watch out.
He got bodyguards on the roof.

01:27:10.166 --> 01:27:12.657
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

01:27:20.176 --> 01:27:21.507
Buckwheat.

01:28:23.071 --> 01:28:24.504
Punk!

01:28:26.307 --> 01:28:27.103
Kill him!

01:28:27.308 --> 01:28:31.369
How the hell can you wear this and sell
poison to our people? You ain't shit!

01:28:36.317 --> 01:28:37.545
Toss him down to me.

01:28:44.325 --> 01:28:46.725
That teacher you killed?
That was my mother!

01:28:49.664 --> 01:28:51.689
Kick his black ass!

01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:57.729
These are the people you squash
and kill with no retribution.

01:28:59.507 --> 01:29:00.735
Get your ass up.

01:29:07.814 --> 01:29:10.146
This ain't business, bitch.
This is personal.

01:29:15.756 --> 01:29:18.725
I wanna shoot you so bad,
my dick's hard.

01:29:18.926 --> 01:29:20.359
Coming through, excuse me.

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:24.920
We'll do this the right way.

01:29:26.466 --> 01:29:27.694
I'll testify.

01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:30.335
Even if it means my life,
I will testify.

01:29:30.537 --> 01:29:33.062
Come on. We can't go out like this.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.668
Put the gun down.

01:29:43.217 --> 01:29:45.777
Don't throw your life away
on a piece of shit.

01:29:50.257 --> 01:29:52.157
Give me the gun. I'll do it.

01:30:03.403 --> 01:30:05.132
I'll be out in a week.

01:30:06.406 --> 01:30:08.067
You're a dead man.

01:30:15.615 --> 01:30:20.245
Was the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown,
head of the CMB?

01:30:32.932 --> 01:30:35.423
Remove the hat and the sunglasses.

01:30:37.837 --> 01:30:41.432
Detective Appleton, when you
infiltrated the CMB...

01:30:41.707 --> 01:30:44.198
...did the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown...

01:30:44.410 --> 01:30:49.347
...attempt to buy two and a half kilos
of cocaine from you?

01:30:49.949 --> 01:30:52.179
Did he? Can Michael Jordan slam-dunk?

01:30:52.451 --> 01:30:54.976
Of course he did. He's a dope dealer.

01:30:55.187 --> 01:30:57.348
That's what they do, buy and sell dope.

01:30:59.125 --> 01:31:00.456
I'm not guilty.

01:31:00.926 --> 01:31:02.689
You're the one who's guilty.

01:31:03.596 --> 01:31:06.963
You lawmakers, the politicians,
the Colombian drug lords...

01:31:07.199 --> 01:31:10.134
...all you who lobby against
making drugs legal.

01:31:10.469 --> 01:31:13.335
Just like you did with alcohol
during Prohibition.

01:31:13.538 --> 01:31:15.301
You're the one who's guilty.

01:31:16.641 --> 01:31:19.201
Let's kick the ballistics here.

01:31:19.477 --> 01:31:21.968
Ain't no Uzis made in Harlem.

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:26.373
Not one of us in here
owns a poppy field.

01:31:26.651 --> 01:31:29.711
This thing is bigger than Nino Brown.
This is big business.

01:31:29.988 --> 01:31:31.979
This is the American way.

01:31:33.224 --> 01:31:36.785
I'm sure that the court
was enlightened...

01:31:36.995 --> 01:31:39.395
...by your geopolitical tirade.

01:31:39.664 --> 01:31:43.623
Unfortunately, society at large
is not on trial here.

01:31:43.902 --> 01:31:46.393
You are, Mr. Brown.

01:31:47.072 --> 01:31:48.903
Were you or were you not...

01:31:49.174 --> 01:31:54.009
...head of the narcotics consortium,
the murderously bloody...

01:31:54.212 --> 01:31:55.736
...CMB?

01:31:58.083 --> 01:32:01.075
I could not hear you.
Would you please speak up?

01:32:01.353 --> 01:32:03.514
Yes, I was a member.

01:32:04.022 --> 01:32:06.149
But I was forced into this way of life.

01:32:07.025 --> 01:32:09.755
I've been dealing drugs
ever since I was 12 years old.

01:32:10.028 --> 01:32:13.862
I didn't have the chances
that you have, Miss Hawkins.

01:32:14.099 --> 01:32:18.762
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth, Miss Hawkins.

01:32:20.871 --> 01:32:25.035
I wanted to get out,
but they threatened to kill my mother.

01:32:25.242 --> 01:32:28.700
Who are you talking about,
Mr. Brown? What "they"?

01:32:29.446 --> 01:32:30.674
They.

01:32:31.548 --> 01:32:34.278
Look at him. Kareem Akbar.

01:32:35.652 --> 01:32:39.611
That's right, the educated brother from
the bank. He's the head of the CMB.

01:32:39.823 --> 01:32:41.415
The brains behind the whole thing.

01:32:41.625 --> 01:32:44.685
This is bigger than Nino Brown,
and I got a list to prove it.

01:32:44.895 --> 01:32:47.955
If I'm going down, I'm taking
a lot of people with me.

01:32:48.399 --> 01:32:50.230
Order in the court!

01:33:10.587 --> 01:33:13.647
Your Honor, may counsel
approach the bench?

01:33:15.592 --> 01:33:18.425
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:33:22.165 --> 01:33:23.655
What's the discussion?

01:33:30.773 --> 01:33:33.264
The court is not pleased
with this application.

01:33:33.676 --> 01:33:37.339
You understand that by pleading
guilty to a lesser charge...

01:33:37.613 --> 01:33:42.448
...the court, under law, can impose
a sentence of 3 years to life...

01:33:43.119 --> 01:33:47.180
...with parole eligibility
after 12 months. Do you understand?

01:33:49.692 --> 01:33:50.989
Absolutely.

01:33:52.361 --> 01:33:54.056
How could you let this happen?

01:33:54.263 --> 01:33:58.256
We wanted some of the crack
off the streets. I wanted Nino too.

01:33:58.468 --> 01:34:02.370
He gave up his connections
and Powell wanted to make the deal.

01:34:03.539 --> 01:34:04.767
Let's go.

01:34:06.676 --> 01:34:08.644
This court is now adjourned.

01:34:09.712 --> 01:34:12.840
What? All he gets is a year?

01:34:13.115 --> 01:34:14.548
This ain't happening.

01:34:15.885 --> 01:34:18.547
I should have killed you myself, bitch.

01:34:19.555 --> 01:34:21.886
That's the difference between
