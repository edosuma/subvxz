WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.007
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.170 --> 00:08.427
This laptop contains 40 million rubles
worth of bank transfers from Kovar

00:08.592 --> 00:09.969
that Gregor hasn't disclosed.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.555
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.354
Prometheus surprised me
with a very specific unique move.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.602
It was taught to me
by a woman that I met in Russia.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.653
You think you and Prometheus
have the same teacher?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.697
You're accepting the invitation
to join Helix?

00:22.856 --> 00:23.857
Full throttle.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.947
What do I do with your secret? I keep it.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.453
I care about this city,
and you're working double-time.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.159
Can you talk some sense into him please?

00:30.405 --> 00:32.281
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.285
I thought we could talk.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.789
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.918
It's important.
You could call it life or death.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.316
You sure this is the place?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.482
<i>I don't see any other monasteries
on this mountain.</i>

01:00.644 --> 01:03.397
Felicity's notes said something
about a demon?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.658
Oh, wait, maybe that says "lemon."

01:05.857 --> 01:08.155
Anyway, I texted her,
but she has not hit me back.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.369
It says "demon."

01:12.656 --> 01:14.658
- Oliver? I'm losing you.
- I'll see you back in Star City.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.225
Where is she?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.558
- Who are you?
- I'm a former student.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.685
"Former." Which means
you are not welcome here.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.535
<i>Hold!</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:01.873
Leave us.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.713
I would apologize
for my students' enthusiasm,

02:09.045 --> 02:11.174
but you should not have come
to this place.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.759
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.311
Our business together concluded
five years ago.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.512
No.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.849
One of your former students
is trying to kill me.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.271
He doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.232
He means to destroy you utterly.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.192
You knew?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.400
If you knew, then why would you train him?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.405
Why wouldn't you warn me?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.954
Two years ago, he sought me out.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.326
He'd already learned much about you.
He is a man of remarkable capacity.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.583
Talia, enough! If you knew what he wanted
then why would you train him?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.665
You killed his father.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.759
And I helped him
in his pursuit of vengeance

02:47.959 --> 02:49.802
because by then, you'd killed mine.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.886
I never told you my full name, did I?

02:57.594 --> 02:59.016
No, you didn't.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.390
It's Talia al Ghul.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.902
Ra's al Ghul was your father.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.361
Yes.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.447
My father and I came to be at odds,
so I forged my own path.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.452
But he was still my father
when you put a sword through his chest.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.422
So that's why you're not going to help me.

03:26.832 --> 03:31.929
That's why you won't tell me
who this "Prometheus" is.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.132
Of course I will, Oliver.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.686
Because I want you to suffer.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.023
He calls himself...

03:45.392 --> 03:46.939
Adrian Chase.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.329
- Everything okay?
- Yes. Peachy.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.377
Let's do this. Whoa.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.712
Yeah, it's lit, right?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.793
All these people, they're just...

04:12.002 --> 04:13.049
You sound surprised.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.379
Yeah, I mean, I guess I just thought

04:14.546 --> 04:17.470
that a secret hacker organization
would be a little bit more...

04:17.673 --> 04:19.346
Well, I don't know, intimate.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.679
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.145
Kind of like the UN,
if it actually accomplished things.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.019
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to
interface with a neural network?

04:29.186 --> 04:31.814
We were working on something like this
at Palmer Tech. It...

04:32.022 --> 04:34.491
Who do you think
we stole the prototype from?

04:36.151 --> 04:37.403
What is that?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.863
Real-time feed
from every cell phone camera in the world

04:40.071 --> 04:42.039
running through
a pattern-recognition algo.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.709
Holy... That's...

04:44.951 --> 04:47.830
So much bigger than anything
the NSA is doing, I know.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.587
This is a lot of power for
someone to have, who's not government.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.802
Well, the fact that
we're not government's the whole point.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.216
Power to the people, right?

04:55.545 --> 04:56.671
Yeah.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.556
Power to the people.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.142
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.725
We're going to change the world together.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.019
<i>Mr. Queen, I've been
trying to reach you all...</i>

05:11.186 --> 05:13.234
I need Captain Pike
and Quentin Lance in my office

05:13.396 --> 05:14.818
and I need to know
where DA Chase is right now.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.488
Right now?
Mr. Chase is in the conference room.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.909
Treatment for drug addicts
over incarceration.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.834
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think
you'd be joining us this morning.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.209
I guess you know
what I've been up to, huh?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.414
Yeah.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.752
I've been working on addressing
our sentencing policy for drug offenses.

05:34.918 --> 05:35.919
Care to join?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.721
I'd like to see you in my office please.

05:38.922 --> 05:42.301
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.387
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.

05:45.929 --> 05:46.930
You tired?

05:48.306 --> 05:50.775
Or is it that you've actually been asleep
this whole time?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.112
All the captains are dead.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.279
<i>Da.</i>

06:44.821 --> 06:49.372
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him.
They will kill us all.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.587
Gonna try it this way, now?

07:03.632 --> 07:06.226
I gotta tell you, I don't know how
that mask is gonna play here.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.392
Especially since this city's not too fond
of your alter ego these days.

07:10.013 --> 07:13.313
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer,
see how they feel.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.486
Wait, that's your big plan, arresting me?

07:16.686 --> 07:18.859
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown,
I have to say.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.033
Well, I'm not going to kill you.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.745
If only because
that's what you want me to do.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.535
But you've done
everything I've wanted so far.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.494
Did you really think
I'd let all this end in a parking garage?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.375
What did you do?

07:34.746 --> 07:36.623
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.293
<i>Wait. Are you still dating Susan Williams?</i>

07:39.501 --> 07:41.845
I gotta tell you, buddy,
it's been a little hard to keep track.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.388
What did you do to her?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.386
She's fine. Don't worry.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.393
As long as I'm around to make sure
she gets some food and water.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.225
Starvation and dehydration.
Terrible way to go.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.479
Bottom line, I die, she dies.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.570
<i>I don't make it back to her in time,
she dies.</i>

07:58.853 --> 08:01.231
Now, you could try torturing me
for her location.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.400
We both know what you're capable of
in that department.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.158
But I think that we both know
what I'm capable of.

08:07.737 --> 08:12.584
So, Ollie, who do you think
can last longer, Susan or me?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.171
Oh.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.831
I'm ten steps ahead of you

08:18.081 --> 08:21.005
and you haven't even figured out
what game we're playing yet.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.474
That son of a bitch.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.433
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.477
This is a hell of a city you got here.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.609
- District Attorney's a serial killer.
- He's way worse than that.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.155
Infiltrating the government like that,

08:43.356 --> 08:46.075
at the highest level,
right next to Oliver?

08:47.235 --> 08:48.782
We underestimated this guy.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.284
I underestimated him.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.449
I trusted him.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.959
Where is Felicity?

08:59.247 --> 09:02.171
I've been texting her like crazy,
but her phone's off.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.883
- You don't think that Prometheus is...
- No.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.972
No, his game is Susan.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.801
For now. We have to make sure Thea's safe.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.810
Lyla and JJ are secure at A.R.G.U.S.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.147
I got in touch with Thea. She's fine.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.313
But we have to find Susan.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.737
We cannot make a move on Chase

09:22.979 --> 09:25.983
until we know she's safe,
until we have her here.

09:27.484 --> 09:31.079
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.664
We should go to Pike.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.290
Tell him Chase
is the Throwing Star Killer.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.459
And then he asks for evidence
and you say what?

09:36.659 --> 09:37.660
Look, Quentin's right.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.171
Right now, we keep the SCPD out of this
until we have something.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.505
This guy has us in check.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.668
Yeah, for now.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.559
I sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.894
For Chase's mother?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.897
He has leverage, we need some of our own.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.189
That's not gonna work.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.730
This guy always seems to be
ten steps ahead.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.732
Well, it was pretty easy
you confronting him in public like that.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.368
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I wasn't thinking.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.445
Where're you going now?

10:12.654 --> 10:15.157
According to city records,
Chase's house has a sub-basement.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.867
Well, Chase does everything sideways, man.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.869
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.458
- I don't know what's obvious anymore.
- Hold on.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.547
I can't let you go out there alone.
I'm going with you.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.800
- I can handle it.
- Never said you couldn't.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.555
Three of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.680
No, we need a way to convince the Bratva
that Gregor sold them out.

10:37.846 --> 10:38.847
We had way.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.898
Well, we don't have anyone
that can pull data

10:41.099 --> 10:42.942
off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...

10:43.268 --> 10:46.317
Without proof, Gregor will say
we are traitors,

10:47.105 --> 10:49.233
rest of Bratva will believe him.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.742
And then they will kill us.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.112
So we gotta kill him first.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.573
Before he tells anyone.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.576
Okay, you've had enough to drink already.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.454
Where would Gregor go?

11:02.912 --> 11:05.085
And where would he go right now?

11:05.498 --> 11:06.920
He'd go to ground.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.087
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink.
But it's heavily protected.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.759
Hmm. We wouldn't even
get through the door.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.891
I think I know someone who can.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.097
I guess Norma Bates
got the hell out of Dodge.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.228
Chase anticipated this play.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.771
I never said that he wasn't clever.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.563
But so am l.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.109
Um...

11:33.860 --> 11:34.952
What's your toy doing?

11:35.111 --> 11:37.034
It's detecting
the resonance frequencies upstairs.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.332
But it's not a toy,
it's a T-Sphere.

11:39.616 --> 11:40.708
Wait.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.665
Every horror movie ever has basically said

11:43.912 --> 11:47.667
that you do not go upstairs at
a creepy serial killer's mother's house.

11:49.876 --> 11:50.968
<i>SUSAN". Help!</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:53.720
<i>Someone.</i>

11:57.967 --> 11:58.968
<i>Help-</i>

12:07.894 --> 12:11.569
<i>Excellent.
Now give us another scream.</i>

12:14.442 --> 12:16.740
So, what, we're supposed to
just to go to work like things are normal?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.281
- 'Cause newsflash, they ain't.
- Tell me something I don't already know.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.493
I can think of one or two things.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.540
This is nice,
everything being out in the open now.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.542
All the cards on the table, as it were.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.502
You got some nerve showing up here.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.092
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.516
Speaking of, I thought my office
had requested your verifications

12:38.758 --> 12:41.227
on the latest ComStat reports
from the SCPD.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.641
What've you been doing?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.352
I'm gonna kill you.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.684
In ways that'll hurt.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.571
Threatening a city official is a felony,
Mr. Ramirez.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.692
You think you're so clever?
This isn't over, you son of a bitch.

12:54.857 --> 12:58.202
I agree. In fact,
I think we're just getting started.

13:00.863 --> 13:05.209
I want those ComStat verifications
on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.338
We can't just let that son of a bitch
walk around here. We gotta do something.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.759
We are doing something.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.387
Yeah, Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at City Hall.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.339
You've got a green light
to move on his house.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.261
Roger that.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.151
Okay, Spartan, you check the upstairs
and work your way down.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.982
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.241
Roger that.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.765
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase?

14:04.927 --> 14:07.521
- What are you doing in my house?
- Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.931
Get away from me.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.938
Your husband isn't who you think he is.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.773
Get out of my house.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.814
<i>Mrs. Chase, your husband
is the Throwing Star Killer.</i>

14:16.064 --> 14:19.910
He's holding an innocent woman hostage.
And I need your help to find her.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.277
You're insane.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.829
Doris, please.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.412
You need to understand the truth.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.502
You have to know on some level

14:29.744 --> 14:31.963
that your husband has been
keeping something from you.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.257
The police and the Mayor say
that you're the killer. You.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.799
On the floor! On the floor!
Get down on the floor!

14:40.463 --> 14:43.137
<i>Can you hear me?
Get down on the floor! Now!</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:46.268
- You all right, Mrs. Chase?
- I'm fine.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.356
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry. We've got this handled.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.233
Get her out of here.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.279
Dammit. What do you want me to do?

14:56.521 --> 14:59.024
I'm not getting into a shootout
with the SCPD.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.490
Copy that. I'm out.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.859
Smart move, douchebag.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.324
I wasn't talking to you.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.322
Drop the bow and get on the ground.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.180
The whole thing's about 30 seconds long.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.681
I've been over every frame, and
there's nothing to indicate a location.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.519
At least it's proof of life.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.563
Yeah, she was alive
when this video was made,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.515
but we don't know how long ago.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.225
Sorry.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.068
It's fine. He'll...

15:36.352 --> 15:38.025
He'll keep her alive to keep me in check.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.155
I never should have gotten involved
with Susan.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.608
I don't know what I was thinking.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.862
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.864
Yeah, well, maybe I gave up that right
when I put on the hood.

15:48.448 --> 15:52.248
Hi! Oh, hi. I'm sorry. I know I'm late.
I'm sorry. I got Curtis' messages.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.204
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm here now, I'm sorry.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.755
Can you give us the room please?

16:02.253 --> 16:05.723
Much appreciated. I usually like my
tongue-lashings to be done in private...

16:05.882 --> 16:06.974
So thank you.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.884
I'm...

16:10.178 --> 16:12.055
- Sorry.
- I'm not angry.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.556
You don't...

16:13.931 --> 16:15.808
You don't work for me. You...

16:18.394 --> 16:19.441
I'm worried.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.938
Right.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.450
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have...

16:24.692 --> 16:25.864
I'm not...

16:27.570 --> 16:29.072
I'm worried about you.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.537
Oh.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.493
Because you're into something,

16:34.744 --> 16:36.587
and you don't want to
tell anyone about it.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.752
Or maybe you just don't want to tell me.

16:39.248 --> 16:43.003
I think we can both agree
that keeping secrets doesn't end well.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.092
So...

16:47.048 --> 16:51.144
Yeah, you're right. It's just that
right now is not really a good time.

16:51.636 --> 16:52.853
With everything going on.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.691
You just have to trust me
on this one. Okay?

16:58.935 --> 16:59.936
Okay.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.104
But speaking of the "something"
that I'm into,

17:02.313 --> 17:05.112
it actually helped me go through
the petabyte of data

17:05.273 --> 17:06.320
we took off

17:06.526 --> 17:09.621
...of Chase's mother's computer... This...

17:09.987 --> 17:11.704
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.579
- What?
- Simon Morrison is his birth name.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.742
That's his real identity.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.752
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.630
Yes, well, she changed her name
when she went off the grid.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.299
So, runs in the family.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.627
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias...

17:23.834 --> 17:25.426
Then the proof that his background is fake

17:25.586 --> 17:27.884
will be enough for the ACU
to arrest his ass.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.137
- However you did it, good work.
- Thank you.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.143
Put this all in the drive.
I've got to get to City Hall.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.806
Wait, well... Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.692
Yeah, before the 11:00 news.
I have to make a statement

17:39.850 --> 17:42.148
on the Green Arrow
breaking into the DA's house.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.866
Obviously, this is
a horrifying development.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.322
Uh...

17:53.489 --> 17:56.993
We believe the Green Arrow was retaliating
against this office for speaking out

17:57.159 --> 17:58.957
against his recent crimes.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.213
Mr. Mayor?

18:09.797 --> 18:14.394
This office is in complete agreement
with DA Chase.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.478
This situation has become untenable.

18:22.268 --> 18:26.398
And I'm determined to bring it
to a just and successful end.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.610
I will not let anyone, anyone...

18:30.985 --> 18:32.578
Terrorize this city.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.872
So I'm demanding
that the Green Arrow turn himself in.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.996
He has 24 hours,

18:43.080 --> 18:46.380
before I'm ordering the SCPD
to shoot on sight.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.341
That's all. Thank you.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.100
Thanks for seeing me. I know it's late.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.521
Oh, I think we both know our jobs
don't recognize "late" and "early."

19:03.225 --> 19:04.852
What can I do for you?

19:06.937 --> 19:08.029
What's this?

19:08.230 --> 19:12.235
That is evidence that "Adrian Chase"
is a false identity.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.367
His real name is Simon Morrison.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.915
And with some investigation,
you will learn

19:18.157 --> 19:20.080
that he's the Throwing Star Killer.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.545
That's one hell of an accusation.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.293
That's why I'm giving you that.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.837
And this evidence comes from where?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.924
An investigation that I've been
conducting off the books.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.304
With what personnel?

19:32.546 --> 19:34.640
Work the lead, Captain Pike.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.352
Consider that an order, if it helps.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.771
One last thing.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.482
You didn't get that from me.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.146
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.945
Very well.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.622
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.201
Now tell me, why did you want him gone?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.204
And why you are playing Robin Hood?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.626
I met a woman.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.042
She taught me
how to give my darkness an identity.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.839
So that it doesn't consume me.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.470
And you believed her?

20:15.464 --> 20:17.808
Gloopy. Oliver...

20:18.551 --> 20:21.179
Whatever you think is inside you,

20:22.012 --> 20:23.184
is inside you.

20:23.639 --> 20:27.735
You cannot name it like that
and keep it apart from you.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.858
This woman has taught me differently.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.357
This woman does not know
what she is talking about.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.275
And if you're not careful, Oliver,

20:34.483 --> 20:36.827
one day she will be the source
of your greatest pain.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.417
Oh, my God.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.673
- And this is...
- We've been calling him Prometheus

20:49.915 --> 20:51.758
but you helped me ID him
as Simon Morrison.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.927
I've been striking out
on getting a location off this,

20:54.128 --> 20:56.551
but someone with a cell phone at some
point must have entered this room,

20:56.714 --> 20:58.512
which means there should be
pictures of it on your database.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.060
If I can cross-reference the images
of your database with this video,

21:01.260 --> 21:02.637
I should be able
to help the police find her.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.062
And that's, like,

21:04.346 --> 21:08.351
really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help.

21:08.851 --> 21:09.852
But?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.648
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.027
We helped you sort through that data pull.
And now...

21:17.276 --> 21:20.075
Well, people are starting to ask
what you're doing for us.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.749
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so
you could check items off your to-do list.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.544
Sorry, that feels gross saying.

21:28.579 --> 21:33.130
No. Uh, no, you're right. Okay.
So quid pro quo. I help you, you help me.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.803
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.517
We've been trying to break the encryption
on a certain Homeland Security drone.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.014
- Why?
- Need-to-know, I'm afraid.

21:43.219 --> 21:47.224
Question is, what are you willing to quo
in exchange for your quid?

21:50.601 --> 21:52.649
Yeah, can you check some files for me?

21:52.895 --> 21:55.819
Any legal records you can find
on a Simon Morrison.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.570
Thanks.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.822
Hey. Hey, you okay, buddy?

22:03.489 --> 22:05.241
Need some medical attention or something?

22:18.212 --> 22:19.259
What happened?

22:19.505 --> 22:22.725
Some lowlife attacked him outside
the precinct. SCPD's canvassing,

22:22.925 --> 22:25.098
but the security cameras,
they did not get a shot of his face.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.021
How's Pike?

22:29.265 --> 22:30.608
He's comatose.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.567
This was Chase.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.947
I don't know, Oliver. Murder by lowlife
is not exactly his style.

22:40.150 --> 22:45.122
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead,
connecting Chase to Prometheus.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.538
I thought we didn't have any leads.

22:48.826 --> 22:53.047
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?

22:53.289 --> 22:55.633
No. But somebody else is.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.226
Life is just so fragile, isn't it?

23:09.805 --> 23:13.309
Decades of hopes and dreams,
and in one moment,

23:13.642 --> 23:16.361
one little mistake
and it all just goes away.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.118
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.536
Really?

23:28.824 --> 23:31.168
Because so far, you haven't been able
to do much to stop me.

23:32.745 --> 23:37.046
Susan's fine, by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.928
Me and my team are going to find her.

23:41.712 --> 23:42.713
Huh.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.885
And when we do, the second that we do,

23:50.888 --> 23:53.266
I'm going to put an arrow
right through your heart.

23:55.225 --> 23:58.104
You do realize
how impotent you sound, right?

23:58.854 --> 24:02.734
You think this is a game.
I don't feel like playing anymore.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.746
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me,

24:07.071 --> 24:10.666
you kill Susan.
And she'll be as dead as your mother.

24:11.158 --> 24:15.629
As Tommy. As Shado. As Laurel.
As your friend Pike here, probably.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.669
All dead, because of you.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.426
So go ahead, kill me.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.676
Let's find out how much more loss
you can take.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.634
Because I don't think it's much.

24:29.343 --> 24:33.564
I think that you're one loss away
from being destroyed.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.491
I guess we'll have to find another way
to end all this, then.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.285
You see, that's the beautiful thing
about all of this, Oliver.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.956
If you kill me,
you'll only really be killing yourself.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.326
Thanks for the assist.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.320
What is thing you're doing
with your voice?

26:34.676 --> 26:38.306
Okay, okay, okay. Oh. Oh.
I'm in. Whoo. We're in.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.023
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.522
Did we just accidentally hack
a DHS drone system?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.021
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say "accidentally." Am I right?

26:45.187 --> 26:48.942
Uh-uh-uh. Felicity, please explain to me
why we're hacking Homeland Security drones

26:49.191 --> 26:51.910
instead of finding Susan's location
like you told me we were doing?

26:52.152 --> 26:55.622
Because hacking the drones
is what's going to lead us to Susan.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.284
It's so complicated.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.254
Holy crap. You... You just sent
the receiver false data.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.749
And now you're spoofing the GPS system.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.214
There's nothing slight about this,
this is just straight-up illegal.

27:08.460 --> 27:12.181
Spill. 100% deets. Right now. Right now!

27:12.464 --> 27:16.810
Okay, okay! So, I've kind of made
some new friends. Surprised?

27:18.345 --> 27:22.020
And they have access to inaccessible
amounts of data and intel, tons of it.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.855
They helped me get John out of prison.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.061
And now, they're willing to help us
find Susan, that's all.

27:26.270 --> 27:30.400
If you redirect
a few US Border Control drones.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.493
Hey, don't look at me like that.
I've already gotten chapter and verse

27:33.694 --> 27:35.367
from John and Oliver.
Please don't. Please?

27:36.071 --> 27:39.746
I can't imagine them signing off on you
hacking Homeland Security.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.750
They don't know, do they?

27:45.122 --> 27:47.875
All they need to know
is that I'm a grown woman

27:48.083 --> 27:50.006
making my own grown-up decisions.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.170
<i>He'!-</i>

27:51.420 --> 27:53.218
- Got anything for me?
- Felicity, you can't...

27:56.258 --> 27:57.475
Oliver?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.778
What is it, man?

28:11.273 --> 28:12.695
Is it Susan?

28:13.734 --> 28:14.951
Not yet.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.789
But it's just a matter of time.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.041
And I don't know what I can do stop it.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.204
Oliver, there are always options.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.966
- And you're not alone.
- You think that's the problem?

28:31.919 --> 28:34.968
You've done a wonderful job
of convincing me

28:35.172 --> 28:37.140
that I'm changing for the better.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.303
With recruits and...

28:44.264 --> 28:48.815
Transparency, more optimism, more...
More trust.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.865
You think none of this would've happened
if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?

28:54.024 --> 28:55.116
Trusted anyone.

28:56.818 --> 29:02.291
Because I can't see anything past
me just creating more targets.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.421
We're not targets, man.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.211
We're your teammates.

29:16.213 --> 29:17.635
We're your strength.

29:18.674 --> 29:23.521
You give me strength
until Chase turns it into a weakness.

29:25.347 --> 29:29.147
Look at what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan,

29:29.685 --> 29:33.610
and in so doing
I gave Chase a way to get to me.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.697
That could happen with you, with...

29:39.611 --> 29:41.113
With Felicity.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.122
With my son.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.547
All of you make me vulnerable, John.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.962
Maybe.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.587
Maybe we do.

29:59.756 --> 30:03.306
But caring about people, Oliver,
that makes you human.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.691
Being human is a luxury
I might not get to have.

30:14.563 --> 30:15.689
Yeah.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.578
Okay, got it. Tell Dinah and Rene.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.449
Felicity found out
where Chase is keeping Susan.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.459
- Let's go.
- No, no, John.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.788
There's something I need you to do for me.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.008
If I'm gonna beat this guy
it'll be by playing his game.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.797
And I know someone
who makes him vulnerable.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.937
This is where Prometheus
is holding Susan?

30:51.308 --> 30:53.106
Or at least he was
when he shot that video.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.859
I'm reading a few dozen
heat signatures inside.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.779
<i>- Chase brought back-up?
- Or</i> he's using <i>decoys.</i>

30:59.983 --> 31:01.781
It's decoys. Prometheus works alone.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.200
Problem is, Susan could be in
any one of those heat signatures.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.122
We should split up,
canvass floor by floor.

31:06.323 --> 31:09.668
Agreed. Overwatch, any word on Spartan?

31:09.993 --> 31:13.463
- Package is en route. ETA five minutes.
- "Package"?

31:13.622 --> 31:15.499
Oliver's got something
up his green sleeve.

31:29.137 --> 31:32.186
These puppies should help
double our search capability.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.326
Uh... Next time,
I get to kick the door in.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.988
Yeah. Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.

31:53.829 --> 31:54.876
Get back!

31:59.167 --> 32:00.168
What was that?

32:00.377 --> 32:01.594
Some sort of explosion.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.088
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?

32:04.464 --> 32:06.683
Yeah, yeah, we copy.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.602
But we're trapped in here.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.267
That son Of a bitch.

32:11.471 --> 32:15.351
Yeah. What if those heat signatures
are incendiary devices?

32:22.315 --> 32:23.658
I think we can pretty much confirm that.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.037
We have five minutes
for search-and-rescue

32:27.195 --> 32:28.663
before this whole place comes down.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.166
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
I'll find Susan.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.711
Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.

32:38.874 --> 32:39.966
Oliver!

32:40.292 --> 32:42.340
Hey, are you okay?

32:42.544 --> 32:45.423
- Yeah. Adrian Chase is...
- I know!

32:45.714 --> 32:47.557
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you
out of here.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.854
- What's happening?
- Chase is controlling the elevator.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.857
Susan, we need to get you out,
this building is going to explode.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.183
- What about...
- Chase wants me.

32:57.350 --> 33:00.069
- You're no longer his target.
- No, I was gonna say, what about you?

33:00.312 --> 33:03.816
I'm gonna finish this.
Take the elevator upstairs.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.193
Get to safety.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.371
Hello, Oliver.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.627
- Can you guys hear me in there?
- Yeah.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.758
Just waiting on that rescue.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.426
Good. Step back.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.733
I'm glad Talia told you.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.982
I prefer it this way. Face to face.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.940
There's an honesty to it.

33:45.232 --> 33:48.452
Well, honestly,
I'm going to keep both of us here

33:48.610 --> 33:50.954
until this building comes down
on top of us.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.247
- Then you'd be dead.
- So would you.

33:54.449 --> 33:58.295
Really? You really think
I'd let that happen, Oliver?

34:02.791 --> 34:05.840
Remember, I'm always ten steps
ahead of you.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.304
You know, if that were true,

34:09.797 --> 34:12.141
you probably would have seen this coming.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.309
Adrian?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.150
You shouldn't be here.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.315
How else was
I supposed to find out the truth?

34:23.812 --> 34:26.656
- You've killed all those people.
- It's not that simple.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.574
You killed them, it's simple.

34:30.025 --> 34:32.324
I know, baby, this can't be you.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.373
It's not you.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.828
I'm sorry.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.748
I'm so sorry.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.510
Why did you make her come here?

34:52.047 --> 34:53.516
To get you to stop.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.053
You have to stop.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.023
And you have to,
you have to turn yourself in.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.851
- I can't do that.
- Please. Whatever this is,

35:03.184 --> 35:06.154
whatever you're doing, it's over.

35:06.396 --> 35:10.117
- You'd tell the police?
- No, you'd tell them.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.448
You're right.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.038
I'm going to take care of this.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.713
John!

35:56.905 --> 35:58.782
<i>I've got an ambulance on route
to your position.</i>

35:59.115 --> 36:01.538
- Oh, my God.
- Oliver's in there with Chase.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.996
Go help him now! Go!

36:22.597 --> 36:26.397
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not going to kill you.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.153
And you can't kill me.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.113
Yes, Adrian. Yes, I can!

36:51.584 --> 36:52.961
<i>What's going on?</i>

36:53.837 --> 36:55.339
Guys, some sort of sitrep.

36:55.630 --> 36:56.677
Chase is gone.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.601
So is Oliver.

37:17.110 --> 37:19.659
Where's Oliver? Guys?

37:19.988 --> 37:24.209
We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?

37:25.618 --> 37:28.542
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her. Um...

37:29.330 --> 37:31.799
Doris passed away en route
to Starling General.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.544
We gotta work on finding Oliver.

37:34.836 --> 37:37.885
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.473
You're right.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.848
Felicity, please tell me
you're not going to see them again?

37:43.094 --> 37:45.222
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.972
Gregor!

38:31.226 --> 38:32.728
Oliver, is that you?

38:33.478 --> 38:34.570
No.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.732
It's the man who's gonna kill you.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.752
You up for making a statement?

38:49.994 --> 38:52.998
I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase
in the electric chair.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.092
Actually we only got lethal injection
in this state, but I like your thinking.

38:56.334 --> 39:00.259
- Hello, Ms. Williams. Long time, no see.
- You get away from her.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.599
Please don't threaten me. I'm in mourning.

39:03.925 --> 39:07.771
Haven't you heard? The Green Arrow
killed my wife earlier tonight.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.931
And, apparently, the Mayor's missing.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.730
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, Quentin?

39:12.934 --> 39:16.234
Honestly, it doesn't look good, Oliver
disappearing under these circumstances.

39:16.938 --> 39:20.533
You give me one good reason why
I shouldn't have you arrested right now.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.994
Because you don't want
your friend back in pieces.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.952
Right?

39:36.332 --> 39:38.960
Everyone's mega impressed
with the DHS hack you did for us.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.385
That's great.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.512
You've also been chosen
as the first woman to go to Mars.

39:46.885 --> 39:47.932
Sorry.

39:50.179 --> 39:53.058
- Friend of mine is missing.
- The information we gave you didn't help?

39:53.308 --> 39:56.187
- Different friend.
- You have a lot of missing friends.

39:56.436 --> 39:59.064
Yeah. And this time
I have no leads, whatsoever.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.740
You guys have better resources than I do,

40:00.940 --> 40:02.408
and I have to use everything
that I can to find him.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.329
And do whatever you need me to do for you.

40:23.463 --> 40:27.058
I don't believe I taught you
how to escape from shackles, Oliver.

40:31.721 --> 40:33.564
Your father was an honorable man.

40:35.725 --> 40:38.023
You've aligned with a psychopath.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.897
And he'd be ashamed of you.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.860
Well, when it comes
to the shame of fathers,

40:45.026 --> 40:47.870
I shall bow to your superior expertise.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.576
Just make sure he suffers.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.208
That was always the plan.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.668
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.720
That's sweet.

41:05.088 --> 41:09.889
But I'm running out of ways to tell you,
Oliver, I'm not interested in killing you.

41:10.343 --> 41:13.722
Then what the hell is this game
that we're playing?

41:20.353 --> 41:22.526
When I had Susan as my guest,

41:23.481 --> 41:27.611
I confessed to her that you'd helped me
discover who I really am.

41:30.697 --> 41:33.200
That's what I'm going to
help you do, Oliver.
