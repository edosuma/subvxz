for being the most unafraid person
on <i>Fear Factor</i> ever?

07:53.039 --> 07:57.703
And my reward is I get to dump my
stupid husband and marry Kevin Bacon?

07:57.810 --> 08:01.075
Isn't there some kind of law against that?

08:01.180 --> 08:03.080

My grammy may have been a drunk,

11:23.015 --> 11:26.542
300.
Everyone with numbers, follow me.

11:26.652 --> 11:29.644
- Hey, headset. I didn't get a number.
- So don't follow me.

11:29.755 --> 11:32.383
<i>We're only seeing 300 contestants.</i>

11:32.491 --> 11:34.322
Dummy! Maid!

11:34.427 --> 11:37.362
You know how much I care
about you two. Give me your number.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.431
Mm-mmm. Don't look at me.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.057
I've been training for this moment
since I was six.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.035
I can slice an apple in two
from 50 paces...

11:45.137 --> 11:47.037
or decapitate a man from 10.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.039
Mr. Estrada's choice.

11:49.141 --> 11:52.042
Randy, you gotta help me out.
This is for my list.

11:52.144 --> 11:55.511
No way, Earl. I'm wearing a rubber band
so I can hit the high notes.

11:55.614 --> 11:59.846
If I don't go in there, I'm just some weird guy
on line with a rubber band around his danglers.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.750
Randy, I'm gonna snap that rubber band
if you don't let me take your number.

12:02.855 --> 12:06.552
Come on, Randy. I really need your number.
How about we thumb wrestle for it?

12:06.659 --> 12:09.389
No way. You know I inherited
Mom's slow, clumsy thumbs.

12:09.495 --> 12:12.464
Then how about you giveJoy your number,
and the next list item I do...

12:12.565 --> 12:14.624
will be something I make up to you?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.965
Will you do it right now? No waitsies?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.970
Yes, he will. Come on, Darnell.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.870
It's time for me to shine
and rub my dead grammy's face in it.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.034
Hope she gets TV reception in hell.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.921
Got it.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.288
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>He picked number 182-</i>

12:41.393 --> 12:43.987

12:46.098 --> 12:47.998
One.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.364
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>For his audition...</i>

12:50.469 --> 12:53.768
<i>lqball had decided</i>
<i>to challenge Erik Estrada at fancy talking.</i>

12:53.873 --> 12:58.606
Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him, Horatio.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.611
A fellow of infinite jest...

13:00.713 --> 13:03.238
<i>and most excellent fancy.</i>

13:03.349 --> 13:05.510
<i>[Bell Ringing]</i>

13:07.019 --> 13:09.749
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>And win or lose, there was plenty of variety.</i>

13:09.855 --> 13:12.255
Knock, knock.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.849
- Hey, d-
- <i>[Buzzer]</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:18.362
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>My favorite audition was the guy...</i>

13:18.464 --> 13:21.900
<i>who played Ponch in some</i>
<i>stage show called</i> Micro Chips.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.363
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
- Yeah!

13:29.608 --> 13:33.135
Okay, last up is number 300...

13:33.245 --> 13:35.145
Joy Turner.

13:35.247 --> 13:37.875
Finally. Dunkleman out!

13:39.985 --> 13:42.180
Hack stole it from me.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.187
Hello.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.229
<i>My name is Joy Turner...</i>

13:51.330 --> 13:55.994
A.K.A. The Crustacean Sensation.

14:02.508 --> 14:06.308
#You keep saying
you've got something for me #

14:06.412 --> 14:09.472
I don't remember her being that
flexible when we were married.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.176
I do. Sorry, buddy.

14:12.284 --> 14:15.185
#These claws are made

14:15.287 --> 14:18.154
#And that's just
what they'll do #

14:18.257 --> 14:20.851
# One of these days

<i>[Buzzer]</i>

14:23.262 --> 14:26.663
<i>The hell? Which one of you</i>
<i>sons ofbitches gave me the buzz?</i>

14:28.133 --> 14:31.728
I'm pretty sure Erik wouldn't
want to do something like that.

14:31.837 --> 14:34.271
It's, frankly, just too silly.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.273
Too silly?

14:36.375 --> 14:39.367
Y'all took a guy that acted out an entire
episode of <i>The Smurfs</i> by himself...

14:39.478 --> 14:41.503
and he didn't even sound like Gargamel.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.845
On this show you're dealing
with an Erik Estrada...

14:44.950 --> 14:46.850
and Erik enjoys being funny.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.853
- He doesn't like being silly.
- Well-

14:49.955 --> 14:52.685
You tell Erik Estrada
that this is what happens...

14:52.791 --> 14:54.759
to men that say no toJoy Turner.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.725
[Groans]

15:01.700 --> 15:03.600
I was afraid of this.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.301
Joy!

15:10.809 --> 15:13.471
Darnell Turner,
you let me loose right now.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.479
I'm gonna bite off your nose,
Brian Dunkleman.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.481
Then we'll see who looks silly.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.108
<i>[Earl Narrating] We all watched</i>
<i>the show together at the Crab Shack...</i>

15:20.219 --> 15:22.551
<i>just like when there's</i>
<i>a plane crash or chemical spill...</i>

15:22.655 --> 15:25.647
<i>or when someone we know is</i>
<i>involved in a slow-speed chase.</i>

15:25.758 --> 15:28.659
<i>[Joy, Slurred Voice]</i>
<i>I don't wanna watch this crap.</i>

15:28.761 --> 15:31.992
This show is everything that's wrong
with America today.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.396
Change the channel.
<i>Celebrity Rehab</i> is on.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.969
<i>No, keep it on.</i>
<i>I'm hoping they show my audition.</i>

15:38.070 --> 15:43.098
I know I didn't split the apple, but a girl
with nice boobies, swinging a machete? Come on.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.142
<i>[Announcer]</i>
<i>It's time to find out if you are-</i>

15:45.244 --> 15:48.645

15:48.747 --> 15:52.683
<i>There are "nadas"who are good sports,</i>
<i>and "nadas"who are bad.</i>

15:52.785 --> 15:55.948
And then there's Joy Turner.

15:56.055 --> 16:00.492
<i>You tell Erik Estrada that this is what</i>
<i>happens to men that say no toJoy Turner.</i>

16:06.098 --> 16:08.430
<i>Darnell Turner,</i>
<i>you let me loose right now!</i>

16:08.534 --> 16:12.163
I'm gonna bite off your nose, Brian
Dunkleman. Then we'll see who looks silly.

16:13.505 --> 16:16.963
Hey, Estrada, come to Camden
and face me like a man.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.408
Pimmit Hills Trailer Park, Lot "L"-

16:19.511 --> 16:21.479
The one with the bathtub
in the front yard.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.411
The small bathtub, not the big one.

16:26.518 --> 16:29.180
[All Gasping]

16:29.288 --> 16:32.018
Y'all got a problem with that? Huh?

16:32.124 --> 16:34.524
'Cause I got another big-ass shoe.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.390
Anybody? Anybody?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.691
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

16:43.268 --> 16:45.998
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

16:46.105 --> 16:48.005
I believe that's for me.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.167
- [Beeps]
- [Gasps]

16:51.276 --> 16:53.244
I'm gonna need
to step away to take this.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.577
- Go for Darnell.
- Cool. Darnell's got a hair phone.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.141
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.153
Roger that. Don't worry.
I'll destroy it.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.155
[Beeps]

17:08.260 --> 17:11.661
Cool. Darnell blew up his hair phone.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.028
<i>Darnell, what's going on?</i>

17:14.133 --> 17:16.328
<i>It ends up that while</i>
<i>we may laugh at reality TV...</i>

17:16.435 --> 17:19.165
for being the lowest form of entertainment,
apparently the ratings are quite large.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.102
Twenty million people just saw my face.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.763
My Witness Protection cover
has been blown.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.071
<i>Well, I guess all this means</i>
<i>I can't cross you off my list.</i>

17:26.178 --> 17:30.410
Hell no, you can't. You just humiliated me
in front of the whole country...

17:30.516 --> 17:33.007
<i>and you put my husband in danger.</i>

17:33.118 --> 17:37.680
Now you're gonna have to bold, underline
and Italian-size me on that list.

17:37.790 --> 17:42.227
<i>Actually, Joy, he put us all in danger.</i>
<i>We have to relocate.</i>

17:43.829 --> 17:46.559
I don't get it, Darnell.
So one minute we're watching TV...

17:46.665 --> 17:49.031
and the next, you're telling me
the F.B.I.'s snatching us away...

17:49.134 --> 17:51.568
because there's people
that wanna come here and kill us?

17:51.670 --> 17:54.798
Technically, they only want to kill me.
They'll kill whoever else is in the room.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.206
- Wh-When you say,
"Whoever else is in the room"-
- Yeah, I mean you.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.403
- What about me?
- You too.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.480
- Nice.
- <i>And if the F.B.I. Gets here first-</i>

18:02.581 --> 18:04.242
You don't wanna be here for that either.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.715
<i>Joy, we only have time</i>
<i>to pack the essentials-</i>

18:06.819 --> 18:09.617
clothes, medicine
and my grandma's lemon square recipe.

18:09.721 --> 18:12.884
Is she even gonna be your grandma anymore?

18:12.991 --> 18:15.186
Truth be told, she wasn't
my real grandmas to begin with.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.956
She testified against Halliburton.
But I love her to death.

18:18.063 --> 18:21.396
Now as you all know from the flyers
I've put up, the candlelight vigils...

18:21.500 --> 18:23.900
and the billboard on Third Street,
Mr. Turtle remains lost.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.334
The good news is, I gave him
plenty of survival training...

18:26.438 --> 18:28.338
so I expect his imminent return.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.840
So here's his food, his favorite scarf...

18:30.943 --> 18:33.673
and his lip balm for the dry season.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.749
I'm really sorry, Joy.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.752
I feel like this is kinda my fault...

18:41.854 --> 18:43.754
for getting you to go on that show.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.756
It's totally your fault.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.622
- Sorry. You weren't talking to me.
- He's right.

18:48.727 --> 18:52.322
My childhood dream of being famous
was dead and buried, and you dug it up.

18:52.431 --> 18:56.128
<i>You made me go on TV</i>
<i>and turned my dream into a nightmare.</i>

18:56.235 --> 18:58.135
You made me a laughingstock.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.671
Yeah, dummy.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.034
If she's not gonna beJoy anymore,
I thought I'd try it.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.044
It's not for me.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.808
Joy, I promise, I'm gonna
make this up to you.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.985
What are my boys doing wearing
their bicycle helmets?

19:14.086 --> 19:17.021
Sometimes the pick-ups are a little rough.
Tuck your arms in, fellas.

19:17.122 --> 19:19.716
- Joy, please hustle.
- I'm not hurrying for the government.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.816
- I paid their salary the year I did my taxes.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.827
- Joy-
- They may tell me I have to move...

19:23.929 --> 19:28.161
but I'm gonna call the rest of the shots-
what I pack, when I pack, how I pack.

There's so many things
I never got to say to them, like, uh-

20:07.406 --> 20:10.034
Well, maybe I got that covered,
but still, I miss 'em.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.236
I can't just let someone
take my ex-wife...

20:13.345 --> 20:17.145
the guy she cheated on me with
and my two "igelitimate" kids.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.047
I promised Joy
I'd make her dream come true.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.347
<i>That's the last thing I said to her.</i>

20:22.454 --> 20:24.513

20:24.623 --> 20:26.784
Wow. There's still
a little liquid in mine.
