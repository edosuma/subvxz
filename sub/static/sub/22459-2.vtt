Is it really 50/50?

09:05.247 --> 09:07.044
Obey my commands, Orac!

09:07.087 --> 09:09.681
This manual is balls.

09:09.727 --> 09:13.117
Can you turn it down? It's on 23
and ideally I want it no higher than 17.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.727
Mark, women are coming.
We want to make the women hot.

09:15.767 --> 09:19.203
No, you want it cold so they have
to cuddle up to you for warmth.

09:19.247 --> 09:21.715
Plus, frugality is very attractive
in a man.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.758
(DOORBELL RINGS)

09:23.807 --> 09:25.286
Oh, God. Dobby!

09:28.967 --> 09:30.116
Is it cool to get some lunch?

09:30.167 --> 09:33.204
What are you talking about?
It's 7.30. What do you mean?

09:33.247 --> 09:35.681
We're here to see Jez... for some lunch.

09:35.727 --> 09:39.276
Jeremy, there are some children here
who want to have lunch with you.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.036
Yep, cool. Cheers.

09:42.087 --> 09:43.520
Cheers.

09:45.407 --> 09:48.717
What? Look, I've just bought so much
I've got to offload it somewhere.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.758
Just because I'm dealing
a little bit of drugs

09:50.807 --> 09:52.126
does not make me a drug dealer.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.202
Well, yes, it does.

09:53.247 --> 09:54.839
Oh, God!

09:54.887 --> 09:57.685
Come, Mr Tali-ban, tally my bananas.

10:00.087 --> 10:02.647
So this is cool.
Nice to get to know the neighbours.

10:02.687 --> 10:06.282
I said hello to one guy
in the hall but he was, like, really old.

10:06.327 --> 10:08.477
There's an old woman as well.
Have you seen her?

10:08.527 --> 10:11.758
<i>Got to get off the Neighbourhood Watch.</i>
So, tell me,

10:11.807 --> 10:13.320
Elena, what do you, like, do?

10:13.367 --> 10:15.198
I'm working part time
as a legal secretary.

10:15.247 --> 10:20.275
Human rights law, asylum seekers,
torture victims, all that jazz.

10:20.327 --> 10:22.522
But my real passion is music.

10:22.567 --> 10:25.286
Oh, that is so great.
<i>Oh, God, she's perfect.</i>

10:25.327 --> 10:28.399
<i>A musician who devotes her life</i>
<i>to helping losers.</i>

10:28.447 --> 10:31.166
I'm, like, grade eight violin
and a bit of piano.

10:31.207 --> 10:34.597
That's just so cool,
cos I'm a musician, too.

10:34.647 --> 10:36.046
What's your main instrument?

10:36.087 --> 10:38.806
<i>Shitl</i>
I dabble, you know?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.883
I toot, I strum, I bongo.

10:40.927 --> 10:44.920
Oh, I love drums. Play me something.

10:44.967 --> 10:49.324
That's not a bongo. That's just
a small table in the shape of a bongo.

10:49.367 --> 10:50.436
Oh.

10:50.487 --> 10:53.877
So when you're not bongo-ing,
do you, like, work?

10:53.927 --> 10:56.919
<i>Dangerl</i>
I was a male nurse for a while.

10:56.967 --> 10:58.366
Why did you stop?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.921
<i>Disgust at having to help people in need.</i>

11:00.967 --> 11:04.084
The white coats couldn't handle
my whole Patch Adams approach.

11:04.127 --> 11:07.005
I believe a person should be treated
as a human being,

11:07.047 --> 11:08.844
not a mere set of steel pipes.

11:08.887 --> 11:11.196
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>I've got to think of something impressive.</i>

11:11.247 --> 11:13.044
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>have I been doing all these years?</i>

11:13.087 --> 11:14.725
<i>Could be a Dad She'd Like to Fuck.</i>

11:14.767 --> 11:16.723
<i>Only thing I've got in the locker.</i>

11:16.767 --> 11:20.555
Of course, the big news is actually
that I'm going to be having a kid.

11:20.607 --> 11:22.359
Are you in a relationship?

11:22.407 --> 11:24.921
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.878
No, no, a million times no.

11:26.927 --> 11:29.805
No, she's a friend and she was desperate.

11:29.847 --> 11:31.724
And so I was all, like, yeah.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.962
I'm a very strong feminist,

11:34.007 --> 11:37.682
so I believe women should have
whatever mad thing they want.

11:37.727 --> 11:41.640
That's so cute. Cos I often think
that children are our future.

11:41.687 --> 11:43.962
Yeah.

11:44.007 --> 11:47.204
And also, I'm just really
into the whole man, baby thing.

11:47.247 --> 11:51.206
You know, teaching them
to tie things to other things.

11:51.247 --> 11:55.638
And, you know, holding a baby
in the palm of my hand

11:55.687 --> 11:58.997
whilst making an espresso. You know?

11:59.047 --> 12:02.835
<i>Yeah, Russian men are all</i>
<i>probably infertile. Thanks, Chernobyl.</i>

12:02.887 --> 12:06.357
Oh, look, he's hit it.
Do you think it'll go in the hole?

<i>Hard cheese.</i>
<i>And we've already had four whiskies.</i>

12:14.047 --> 12:17.039
<i>So time for me to roll in</i>
<i>my militarised divisions.</i>

12:17.087 --> 12:19.999
<i>Makes it much less scary</i>
<i>if I think about it like a war.</i>

12:20.047 --> 12:22.277
Mark, are you about to lunge?

12:22.327 --> 12:24.079
Is this pre-lunge?

12:24.127 --> 12:26.960
Sorry. Should I have
filled out a lunging application form

12:27.007 --> 12:28.725
and had it ratified by the FSA?

12:28.767 --> 12:31.725
Look, don't get me wrong, I like you.

12:31.767 --> 12:35.157
But maybe let's not do anything tonight.

12:35.207 --> 12:39.086
When the dust's settled with Gerard
and my other dates, we'll see.

12:39.127 --> 12:41.197
OK, that's fine.
<i>Oh, my God, she likes me.</i>

12:41.247 --> 12:44.523
<i>She just said it.</i>
<i>That's undeniable. I can bank that.</i>

12:44.567 --> 12:47.843
<i>I can put it on a blog</i>
<i>so it's a matter of public record.</i>

13:18.927 --> 13:19.996
Oh!

<i>Sure, I dabble</i> -

13:23.287 --> 13:26.040
"Fuck you, Bush." That sounds good.

13:26.087 --> 13:29.716
Yeah, I wrote that some time ago,
but it's still pretty savage.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.997
- Go on.
- Really? OK. Well...

13:33.487 --> 13:37.685

What's going on?

15:15.607 --> 15:16.881
He just talked to Sophie.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.166
Can we talk about this later?

15:20.207 --> 15:21.765
Yeah, sure, but there's news?

15:21.807 --> 15:23.684
What did she say? Whose is it?

15:23.727 --> 15:26.844
Well, it's mine, obviously, it's mine.

15:26.887 --> 15:30.596
It's your baby? Why didn't...
It's definitely your baby?

15:30.647 --> 15:32.000
That's right.

- I was just about to, straight away.

Oh, my God!

15:36.607 --> 15:38.484
Yeah, but we should talk.

Oh, of course we can talk.

the whole emotional splurge later?

a good thing and buck you up later.

Um, look...

the thing is, contrary
to what I said a few seconds ago,

it is actually, definitely your baby.

- Sophie told me.

16:44.767 --> 16:48.521
Yeah, and now do your joke.
What's the punch line?

16:48.567 --> 16:51.559
The results came. Honestly, it's yours.

16:52.647 --> 16:56.356
Then why the fuck did you tell me
it was yours? Did you get mixed up?

16:56.407 --> 16:57.635
Did you misremember?

16:57.687 --> 17:00.406
Because I really think I would
remember something like this.

17:00.447 --> 17:03.166
Look, I know it sounds weird,
but I told Elena I was having a baby.

17:03.207 --> 17:03.923
Why?

17:03.967 --> 17:07.039
It was the only thing I could think of
that made me sound like a proper person.

I'm really sorry, dude. Um...

or, er... or even fork me.

- I'm not going to fork you, Jeremy.
- Fork my leg.

I do... quite want to, but no, too weird.

17:24.926 --> 17:27.760
Well, you've got to fork something.
Fork my bag.

<i>Yeah, lovely Dobby.</i>

18:44.207 --> 18:45.196
Sure.

18:45.247 --> 18:48.319
You know those kids on Long Street
in the nice blue uniforms -

18:48.367 --> 18:49.846
is that a Catholic school?

18:49.887 --> 18:50.876
What?

18:50.927 --> 18:52.679
Nothing, doesn't matter.

18:52.727 --> 18:55.287
Ofsted must have a website.

18:55.327 --> 18:58.080
- Where were we?
- Are you not into this?

18:58.127 --> 19:00.925
God, yes, I'm very much into this.

19:00.967 --> 19:03.879
In fact, I think I might rubber up.

19:03.927 --> 19:05.326
Well, sure.

19:05.367 --> 19:07.801
Condom, yes. Condom.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.236
Condom, condom, condom.

19:12.127 --> 19:14.687
Although... maybe two?

19:14.727 --> 19:15.876
Two condoms?

19:15.927 --> 19:18.839
Two's company. In fact,
maybe I should go for a third.

19:18.887 --> 19:21.355
Three is the magic number.

19:21.407 --> 19:22.635
<i>I've got to tell her.</i>

19:22.687 --> 19:25.565
<i>I couldn't slide this in anyway. It'd be</i>
<i>like trying to clingfilm an earthworm.</i>

19:25.607 --> 19:26.926
I'm sorry, Dobby.

19:26.967 --> 19:31.961
- Just what's wrong, Mark?
- The situation is this, Dobbs.

19:32.007 --> 19:36.683
It's... it's the heat.
It's just too hot in here.

19:36.727 --> 19:39.161
I feel like my head's on fire.

19:39.207 --> 19:41.641
We've only just got a new boiler,
and I can't...

19:41.687 --> 19:45.760
<i>Yeah, talk. Keep up this covering fire</i>
<i>while I retreat from the battleground.</i>

19:45.807 --> 19:48.560
Yeah, so it's going to be
the classic one-egg omelette.

19:48.607 --> 19:50.598
- (RHYTHMIC BANGING)
- MARK: Fuck!

19:50.647 --> 19:52.365
- Fuck! Fuck!
- <i>Is he...</i>

19:52.407 --> 19:54.079
Sorry.
<i>... having the hardest sex ever?</i>

19:54.127 --> 19:58.518
- <i>Of course not.</i>
- Damn you! Fucking, fucking, fuck!

19:58.567 --> 20:00.637
Mark, what are you doing?

20:00.687 --> 20:04.919
It's too hot. It's too bloody hot!
It's ruining everything. Tell it to stop!

20:06.887 --> 20:08.240
Everything all right?

20:08.287 --> 20:11.723
Is it OK if I have quite a massive drink
of any booze you've got?

20:11.767 --> 20:15.442
<i>Oh, they're going to drench</i>
<i>my flirt-fest in geek juice.</i>

20:15.487 --> 20:17.523
Do you want a glass of champagne?

20:17.567 --> 20:20.161
We're just going to have a toast
to Jeremy's baby.

20:20.207 --> 20:21.765
Jeremy's baby?

20:21.807 --> 20:25.516
Er... yeah. Didn't I mention
that Jeremy's having a baby?

20:25.567 --> 20:28.604
Er, no. Wow! Congratulations?

20:28.647 --> 20:30.160
(DOORBELL BING-BONGS)

20:31.927 --> 20:34.077
- To Jeremy's baby!
- Jeremy's baby.

20:34.127 --> 20:35.446
Jeremy's baby.

20:35.487 --> 20:37.921
<i>Mmm, the great taste of ashes.</i>

20:37.967 --> 20:40.117
Um... Mark,

20:40.167 --> 20:42.123
could I have a quick word?

20:42.167 --> 20:44.522
Ladies, talk amongst yourselves.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.285
- (WHISPERS) It's Sophie.
- Oh, my God!

20:48.327 --> 20:51.046
I saw her through the spy hole,
but she might have sensed movement.

20:51.087 --> 20:52.998
- (WHISPERS) Fuck!
- (DOORBELL)

20:53.047 --> 20:54.719
Shouldn't someone answer that?

20:54.767 --> 20:56.246
Probably not going to bother, actually.

20:56.287 --> 20:59.836
Yeah, it's probably that crazy old guy
who keeps ringing our doorbell.

20:59.887 --> 21:04.278
If you answer, he tries to grab your balls
and make you buy a guide to Barcelona.

21:04.327 --> 21:06.966
JEREMY: <i>Where did that come from?</i>
<i>That's nice lyingl</i>

21:07.007 --> 21:07.962
(DOORBELL)

21:08.007 --> 21:12.797
Stupid doorbell man. He's so crazy.
I'll get rid of him.

21:12.847 --> 21:15.236
JEREMY: So... where were we?

21:15.287 --> 21:18.199
And please,
no more talk about my baby.

21:18.247 --> 21:21.239
- (MARK SCREAMS)
- <i>Oh, God, what? I</i>

21:21.287 --> 21:23.198
<i>Has she got in and torn his throat out?</i>

21:23.247 --> 21:24.600
(LAUGHING)

21:24.647 --> 21:29.357
You wouldn't think there was much
voltage going through that little sucker,

21:29.407 --> 21:31.125
but it packs a punch, let me tell you.

21:31.167 --> 21:33.317
I'll answer it.
I'll tell him to fuck off.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.119
No, it's fine.

21:35.167 --> 21:40.002
You just go and shelter. You find refuge
over there. I'll deal with this maniac.

21:40.047 --> 21:43.039
MARK: <i>I'm opening the airlock.</i>
<i>We're all gonna die.</i>

21:43.087 --> 21:46.238
- What the fuck was that all about?
- Sorry, Soph, shall we do this here?

21:46.287 --> 21:48.676
Sorry if it's a bad time,
but why didn't you open the door?

21:48.727 --> 21:50.365
<i>Fatal decompression has begun.</i>

21:50.407 --> 21:53.479
- Did you not tell him?
- No, I told him.

21:53.527 --> 21:55.358
What's going on, Mark?

21:55.407 --> 21:58.638
Right, yeah... What's going on? Um...

21:58.687 --> 22:03.886
Well, sorry not to have mentioned this
before, but, er... Sophie's pregnant.

22:03.927 --> 22:06.680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:06.727 --> 22:09.924
And it's... it's my baby. So no biggie.

22:09.967 --> 22:11.116
What?

22:11.167 --> 22:14.443
- "No biggie"?
- You're both having babies?

22:15.847 --> 22:19.556
Well, no, that's not quite...
It's a bit complicated.

22:20.647 --> 22:23.559
- Let me explain.
- (MOBILE RINGS)

22:23.607 --> 22:25.723
Hi, Jeff, thanks for ringing back.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.959
I'm really confused.
I thought it was <i>your</i> baby.

22:30.007 --> 22:32.202
Yeah, I know. I thought it was, too,

22:32.247 --> 22:37.446
but, um... it looks like it changed
in the womb. Can they do that?

22:37.487 --> 22:40.001
But she said she told you
it was Mark's on the phone.

22:40.047 --> 22:43.039
Yeah, so why did I say it was mine?
It's weird, isn't it?

22:43.087 --> 22:48.115
- It's really weird, Jeremy(!)
- Wow! How did this happen?

22:48.167 --> 22:50.556
OK, the truth is I lied.

22:50.607 --> 22:53.838
I said I was having a baby
because I wanted to impress you.

22:53.887 --> 22:57.926
You're beautiful and intelligent and sexy
and cool and I wanted to seem proper

22:57.967 --> 23:00.925
because, and I probably
shouldn't be telling you this, but...

23:00.967 --> 23:03.561
I know I may <i>look</i> like a real person,

23:03.607 --> 23:07.646
but... I'm not actually a real person.

23:07.687 --> 23:11.043
<i>I truthed it. Truthing worksl</i>

23:11.087 --> 23:14.523
Why didn't you tell me? Were you trying to
impregnate me too? Double your money?

23:14.567 --> 23:17.798
I was going to tell you.
I just didn't want to ruin the mood.

23:17.847 --> 23:20.964
Mark! Man, you're just...

23:21.007 --> 23:24.477
This is just... You really fucked this.
You know that?

23:24.527 --> 23:27.883
But the good news is that
that's why I was so weird in bed.

23:27.927 --> 23:30.236
It wasn't bad technique -
it was the news.

23:30.287 --> 23:31.561
Whoop-de-do(!)

23:31.607 --> 23:36.806
<i>It's OK. I'll send her an e-card...</i>
<i>a charming e-card.</i>

23:36.847 --> 23:40.396
So... I guess we've got
a lot to talk about.

23:40.447 --> 23:43.678
So much. So many details,
and big and small issues,

23:43.727 --> 23:46.002
and grown-up stuff and just, wow!

23:46.047 --> 23:48.481
Yeah, great.

23:48.527 --> 23:52.918
Just... first, Sophie, do you mind
if I ask you one question?

23:52.967 --> 23:56.323
- Uh-huh?
- Do you think it's too hot in here?

23:56.367 --> 23:58.437
Yeah, maybe it is a bit.

23:58.487 --> 24:03.720
Yes! Did you hear that, Jeremy?
Sophie says it's too hot in here!

24:03.767 --> 24:08.636
So I was right. I win.
Shove that up your bollocks!

24:09.807 --> 24:14.881
<i># I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

24:14.927 --> 24:21.924
<i># And I'm so hot</i>
<i>Cos I'm in hell. #</i>
