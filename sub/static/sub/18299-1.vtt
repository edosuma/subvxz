00:45.125 --> 00:46.959
HUMPHREY: Okay, pups.
As we continue

00:46.959 --> 00:50.208
on our first family vacation
to Alfred Creek Falls,

00:50.208 --> 00:54.625
it's time for my infamous
animal impressions.

00:54.625 --> 00:56.041
(PUPS GROANING)

00:56.041 --> 00:58.291
KATE: Groans?
(CHUCKLES) Come on, pups.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.875
You used to love
dad's animal impressions.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.291
CLAUDETTE: (SCOFFS)
Until they got weird.

01:03.291 --> 01:05.041
HUMPHREY: Weird, Claudette?

01:05.041 --> 01:07.625
STINKY: Yeah, Dad.
I gotta agree with
Claudette on this one.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.959
I mean,
doing a porpoise impression.

01:09.959 --> 01:12.500
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING)
PUPS: Weird.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.000
Claudette,
why the long face?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.959
Mom, why couldn't
we bring our friends?

01:17.959 --> 01:20.875
We've gone over this,
Claudette.

01:20.875 --> 01:23.291
This is a family vacation.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.041
And our first one together.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.375
(ALL MOUTHING)
KATE: We get closer

01:26.375 --> 01:28.625
when we have these
shared experiences.

01:28.625 --> 01:32.125
And what do we always say
about a strong family? Huh? Huh?

01:32.125 --> 01:35.500
ALL: A strong family can
survive almost anything.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.041
She has puppy love.

01:41.041 --> 01:43.500
Puppy love?
Like a boyfriend?

01:43.500 --> 01:45.458
(STAMMERING) Oh...
Wait a minute.

01:45.458 --> 01:46.625
You mean Fleet?

01:46.625 --> 01:48.041
Mom, chill.

01:48.041 --> 01:52.458
He's not my boyfriend,
he's just a friend.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.333
Okay, when you
come to a corner,

01:55.333 --> 01:58.166
plant your front paws
and just let your body slide.

01:59.709 --> 02:01.166
(GRUNTING)

02:02.333 --> 02:03.667
Your turn!

02:07.667 --> 02:09.417
Plant your paws!
Whoa...

02:09.417 --> 02:10.709
(SCREAMING)

02:14.542 --> 02:15.875
Fleet?

02:20.250 --> 02:21.583
Mmm...

02:22.542 --> 02:24.417
(CLAUDETTE MAKING
KISSING SOUNDS)

02:24.417 --> 02:26.333
(EXCLAIMS) Sorry.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.583
I was just, uh,

02:28.583 --> 02:30.208
thinking about
all my great friends!

02:30.208 --> 02:31.375
(SNICKERING)

02:31.375 --> 02:33.333
Did you hear that,
Stinky?

02:33.333 --> 02:34.542
Fleet's just a friend.

02:34.542 --> 02:36.875
Hey, I'm staying
above the fray,

02:36.875 --> 02:40.333
but let me just say,
Fleet is one fast dog.

02:40.333 --> 02:43.083
(SCOFFS)
Especially with
the kissy snout.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.667
Humphrey,
did you hear that?

02:44.667 --> 02:47.458
Mom, stop it.
You're being controlling!

02:47.458 --> 02:49.583
I'm being a parent!

02:49.583 --> 02:52.750
And, Runt, you wanna
lose a patch of fur?

02:52.750 --> 02:54.417
Just keeping it real.

02:54.417 --> 02:56.750
Ha! How's this for real?

02:56.750 --> 02:58.375
(GRUNTING)
You, uh...

03:05.291 --> 03:07.417
Hey!
(CHUCKLING)

03:07.417 --> 03:08.917
Boy, she missed again.

03:08.917 --> 03:10.333
(RUNT LAUGHING)
(SIGHS)

03:10.333 --> 03:12.000
Well, at least
they're not bored
anymore.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.458
Runt,
you get down here!
(CLAUDETTE GRUNTING)

03:14.458 --> 03:15.875
Claudette, stop it!

03:15.875 --> 03:17.792
Hey, you two,
knock it off!

03:17.792 --> 03:19.583
Oh, she missed again,
and again.

03:19.583 --> 03:22.250
Should have taken
those tree climbing
lessons I offered.

03:22.250 --> 03:27.083
Mom, Dad, may I suggest
some parenting tips?

03:27.083 --> 03:30.500
When I become the leader,
I will create a wolf park,

03:30.500 --> 03:32.667
so the younger ones
can be supervised.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.333
Okay, Runt, come down.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.125
Claudette, stand down,

03:37.125 --> 03:38.959
and, Stinky,
my eldest son,

03:38.959 --> 03:43.083
that was the most
ridiculous idea
I've ever heard.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.667
And, Runt,
what about you?

03:44.667 --> 03:47.750
Constantly hugging
Frieda and Fran,
the porcupines!

03:47.750 --> 03:49.625
Yeah,
that's really normal!

03:49.625 --> 03:53.375
Wait! That's why I'm always
pulling needles out of you?

03:53.375 --> 03:55.417
They never get hugs!

03:55.417 --> 03:57.291
Because they're mean girls!

03:57.291 --> 04:00.333
Oh, they're not mean,
they're just, prickly.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.125
And they wanted to
come on our trip too!

04:02.125 --> 04:04.166
And just to
roll with that,

04:04.166 --> 04:06.166
if I had been able
to bring Brent,

04:06.166 --> 04:08.667
he could have helped
supervise these two.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.291
Oh, great.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.875
All we need is your
grizzly bear bromance
tagging along!

04:13.875 --> 04:15.375
Seriously, Stinky,

04:15.375 --> 04:18.500
Brent is cool,
but he is a hot mess.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.959
He's not a mess.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.375
Huh? He travels with
a porcupine life coach!

04:23.375 --> 04:25.208
(SCOFFS) Hello.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.959
Agnes keeps him chill!

04:26.959 --> 04:29.333
Okay, Runt, you get
down here right now!

04:29.333 --> 04:31.583
And, Claudette,
when we get back,

04:31.583 --> 04:35.208
I'm going to leash Fleet
and tie him to a tree!

04:35.208 --> 04:36.375
And, Stinky,

04:36.375 --> 04:37.667
you know we respect
mixing it up

04:37.667 --> 04:39.000
with all the critters,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.458
but a little bit of Brent
goes a long way.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.917
Also, his grizzly momma
scares the heck out of me.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.458
If I had pants
I would be wetting them.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.041
Seriously, Stinky,

04:47.041 --> 04:50.041
the last time I asked
if you and he could
have a play date,

04:50.041 --> 04:51.917
she growled at me!

04:51.917 --> 04:54.041
Brent and I have big plans

04:54.041 --> 04:56.041
when we lead
the forest one day.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.875
We're gonna merge
the wolf pack with
the bear clan.

04:58.875 --> 05:01.959
Great idea!
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

05:01.959 --> 05:05.083
What do they say
about brilliance
skipping a generation?

05:05.083 --> 05:08.000
Come on, guys,
you love each other.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.417
Claudette, remember
that time you and Stinky

05:09.417 --> 05:11.542
almost died trying
to save Runt?

05:12.500 --> 05:14.709
This is for Runt!

our lovely family vacation?

05:54.125 --> 05:55.917
Just gorgeous.

(SNIFFING)

05:58.750 --> 06:00.041
What is it, Stinky?

06:00.041 --> 06:03.250
I smell wolves,
coming close.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.542
RUNT: And your smell
is right again.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.250
Hurry, Julia, hurry!

06:07.250 --> 06:09.959
Wait, wait!
What is going on?

06:09.959 --> 06:11.250
You need
to get out of here!

06:11.250 --> 06:12.500
What? What for?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.917
They're trapping wolves!

06:13.917 --> 06:15.250
Trapping wolves?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.709
They're relocating us.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.458
When the caribou
population dwindled...

06:18.458 --> 06:21.125
Relocating?
Are we seriously
back to that?

06:21.125 --> 06:23.834
Oh, they're taking
away all the forest,

06:23.834 --> 06:27.125
and when the forest goes,
so go the caribou.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.208
They're also
capturing wolf pups!

06:29.208 --> 06:31.125
What?
They're transporting them

06:31.125 --> 06:33.000
to the other side
of the country.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.458

I don't know.

Nope.
Definitely not dead.
Ow!

they left us some water.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.917

You got water?

07:01.917 --> 07:04.000
Nope,
definitely not water.

Little piece of advice.

If you wake up in a crate,
don't drink the water.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.041
Are they capturing
wolves everywhere?

07:12.041 --> 07:15.000
No, not past the border
or the mountains.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.834
Most of the wolves are
hiding in the mountains.

and I are going.

from the air.

35:24.792 --> 35:27.667
Come on now!
I'll miss you all.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.458
Where are they?
I don't know.

36:13.458 --> 36:16.291
They just have
to set a paw on this
golfing green

36:16.291 --> 36:18.375
and they're officially
in Idaho.

36:20.417 --> 36:21.625

36:26.709 --> 36:29.750
I gotta do something.
Get our pups out of here.

36:31.917 --> 36:33.208
What is Dad doing?

36:33.208 --> 36:35.125
He'll be okay.

Now, welcome to Idaho!

36:44.959 --> 36:46.250
Where is Humphrey?

36:46.250 --> 36:48.959
We were being shot at,
he wanted to divert them.

36:48.959 --> 36:50.583
(PANTING)

36:50.583 --> 36:52.750
Marcel, Paddy, watch them.

37:04.417 --> 37:07.625
Uh... Is Dad okay?
Is he?

37:07.625 --> 37:09.834
He's the best dad
in the world.

37:09.834 --> 37:13.166
And Mom, she might
be in danger, too.

37:13.166 --> 37:15.125
What if they are taken?

37:15.125 --> 37:19.333
Oh, please...
Please let them make
it past one more...

37:19.333 --> 37:21.125
One more disaster.

37:21.125 --> 37:25.792
Don't let this
be the last drama
for the drama wolves.

But, here we are,
Alfred Creek Falls.

So, how was our first
family vacation, guys?

38:16.709 --> 38:18.542

pressure's on.
