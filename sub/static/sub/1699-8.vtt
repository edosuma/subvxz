00:14.354 --> 00:15.677
We got to stop
this next play

00:15.678 --> 00:16.697
or those scruffs
from Jefferson

00:16.698 --> 00:18.495
are going
to beat us again.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.258
I'm a scruff
from Jefferson.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.733
Go, Jefferson,
get busy.

00:25.139 --> 00:26.739
I got it, I got it!

00:29.232 --> 00:31.062
Oh! I broke a nail!

00:39.354 --> 00:41.102
Rae, what happened?

00:41.103 --> 00:42.408
You said you had it.

00:42.409 --> 00:43.300
Yeah, I did

00:43.301 --> 00:44.762
but then I had a vision.

00:44.763 --> 00:46.787
Chels, do you think
they're mad?

00:49.609 --> 00:50.293
It's cool, Rae.

00:50.294 --> 00:51.471
I'll handle it.

00:51.472 --> 00:53.190
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

00:53.191 --> 00:54.922
This was our championship game

00:54.923 --> 00:58.168
and Raven blew our one shot
at beating Jefferson

00:58.169 --> 01:00.122
you know,
after 27 years.

01:00.123 --> 01:00.628
Chels...

01:00.629 --> 01:01.525
Let's go rag on it.

01:01.526 --> 01:04.580
27 long years.

01:04.581 --> 01:06.069
Chelsea...

01:08.376 --> 01:09.857
I'm sorry, you guys.

01:09.858 --> 01:11.756
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah.

01:12.689 --> 01:13.709
Yo, Rae

01:13.710 --> 01:14.860
what happened
out there?

01:14.861 --> 01:15.962
She had a vision.

01:15.963 --> 01:17.391
But it's cool,
'cause I handled it.

01:18.831 --> 01:22.521
Well, I hope it was one important
vision, Rae, because 27 years...

01:22.522 --> 01:23.669
I know.

01:25.139 --> 01:26.275
Well, what was it?

01:26.276 --> 01:27.776
Chels is going to break a nail.

01:29.154 --> 01:30.739
It was the pinky.

01:31.278 --> 01:32.113
Come on,
you know

01:32.114 --> 01:34.144
the one that she uses
to do Dr. Evil with.

01:38.356 --> 01:40.037
Hey, I didn't ask
for these visions.

01:40.489 --> 01:41.579
It's cool.
Come on.

01:41.580 --> 01:42.669
Let's get something
to eat.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.458
Yeah,
we could celebrate.

01:47.204 --> 01:49.035
The fact that we all have
our health.

01:50.603 --> 01:52.325
No, it's cool.

01:52.326 --> 01:53.488
I'm just going
to head home.

01:53.489 --> 01:54.453
But we're still on

01:54.454 --> 01:55.267
for bowling tomorrow, right?

01:55.268 --> 01:55.926
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

01:55.927 --> 01:57.428
Bye, Rae.
Bye. Peace.

01:59.024 --> 02:01.396
I know what happened
to you out there.

02:01.759 --> 02:03.653
Yeah, I missed the ball.

02:03.654 --> 02:05.949
But I know why.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.065
"Sleevemore Center
for Psy...

02:13.572 --> 02:15.005
for Psychic Research?"

02:15.006 --> 02:16.453
My name's Carly.

02:17.456 --> 02:18.851
Drop by sometime.

03:13.673 --> 03:15.029
Yep, that's me.

03:24.524 --> 03:25.846
Hi, I'm looking for the...

03:25.847 --> 03:26.719
This is it.

03:27.270 --> 03:29.033
Okay, well, the reason
I'm here is...

03:29.034 --> 03:30.776
I know, I know--
volleyball game

03:30.777 --> 03:33.946
you had a vision, screwed up,
everybody's mad at you

03:33.947 --> 03:35.213
blah-blah-blah.

03:35.921 --> 03:37.360
Did you just read
my mind?

03:37.361 --> 03:38.592
Oh, well, I...

03:38.593 --> 03:40.095
Marvin, don't
freak her out.

03:40.096 --> 03:41.996
I told him
the whole story.

03:41.997 --> 03:43.000
Got you.

03:44.982 --> 03:47.236
Marvin's a second-degree
telepath

03:47.237 --> 03:49.643
and a first-degree
pain in the butt.

03:49.644 --> 03:50.845
That's why I love it here.

03:50.846 --> 03:52.741
In school, I'm just
a pain in the butt.

03:52.742 --> 03:54.675
You'll learn
to ignore him.

03:54.676 --> 03:56.434
Come on, I'll
show you around.

03:59.026 --> 04:02.693
Ooh, y'all's electric bill
must be ridiculous.

04:02.694 --> 04:04.465
What do y'all do in here?

04:04.466 --> 04:06.559
Well, we develop
our psychic skills.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.065
Like Marlo here.

04:08.066 --> 04:09.496
She's a spoon bender.

04:12.215 --> 04:15.417
Wow, you bend, girl!

04:16.596 --> 04:19.353
We try to keep her away
from the good silver.

04:20.713 --> 04:24.060
And that guy there
can start fires with his mind.

04:24.061 --> 04:25.451
Hey, Sparky.

04:26.643 --> 04:27.836
So, what are they doing

04:27.837 --> 04:28.818
some kind of experiment?

04:28.819 --> 04:31.479
Uh, no, actually
he's making s'mores.

04:34.137 --> 04:35.628
Did you see
that marshmallow?

04:35.629 --> 04:37.534
And then it...
and then it poofed?!

04:38.026 --> 04:40.564
Am I the only one who thinks
that's amazing?

04:40.565 --> 04:42.595
Well, I guess I am,
okay.

04:42.596 --> 04:45.330
I guess we're
just used to it.

04:45.331 --> 04:46.643
So, what's your thing?

04:46.644 --> 04:48.193
Well, I'm a telepath

04:48.194 --> 04:50.164
so I can read people's thoughts.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.010
And I'm telekinetic.

04:52.011 --> 04:53.458
Oh, what's that?

05:02.166 --> 05:04.410
Yeah, but can you
do the shake?

05:05.326 --> 05:06.341
Yeah!

05:07.039 --> 05:08.866
You're going to fit right in.

05:09.985 --> 05:11.100
I don't really know.

05:11.101 --> 05:12.616
I mean, everybody seems

05:12.617 --> 05:15.320
so in tune
with their psychic abilities.

05:15.321 --> 05:16.095
I wish I was.

05:16.096 --> 05:18.029
Then you've come
to the right place.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.363
I'm Dr. Sleevemore.

05:19.364 --> 05:20.609
Welcome to my center.

05:20.610 --> 05:22.706
Dr. Sleevemore,
this is Raven

05:22.707 --> 05:24.200
the girl
I told you about.

05:24.201 --> 05:25.553
Oh, Raven.

05:25.554 --> 05:27.157
You had the vision.

05:27.158 --> 05:28.871
Screwed up the volleyball game.

05:29.364 --> 05:32.000
Carly, did you have
to tell everybody?

05:32.001 --> 05:33.396
Oh, Carly didn't tell me.

05:34.056 --> 05:35.207
You read my mind?

05:35.208 --> 05:36.719
No, Marvin told me.

05:40.309 --> 05:41.466
Good old Marvin.

05:41.467 --> 05:42.431
Raven

05:42.432 --> 05:43.747
I believe we can help you.

05:43.748 --> 05:44.648
First, we measure

05:44.649 --> 05:45.680
your psychic abilities

05:45.681 --> 05:48.463
on the Sleevemore
Cerebral Oscillator.

05:48.861 --> 05:50.051
Oh, dear me.

05:51.974 --> 05:54.564
Ooh, the Cerebral Oscillator.

05:55.090 --> 05:55.936
Wait a second.

05:55.937 --> 05:57.082
Is that going
to jack up my hair?

05:57.083 --> 05:57.958
Oh, yes.

06:02.604 --> 06:04.531
I'm worried about Lionel.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.649
What's wrong?

06:05.650 --> 06:07.265
I think he's lonely.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.095
Can we get him a dog?

06:09.096 --> 06:11.802
Corey, you don't get a rat
a dog.

06:11.803 --> 06:13.670
Victor, Lionel's not a rat.

06:13.671 --> 06:17.144
Maybe he needs a girlfriend.

06:19.785 --> 06:22.339
The last thing we need
in this house is two rats.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.861
Why don't you get him a mirror?

06:25.361 --> 06:26.996
Now, Victor, come on.

06:26.997 --> 06:29.100
Every man needs a good woman
in his life.

06:29.101 --> 06:30.365
Oh, forget it.

06:30.366 --> 06:31.894
Just get him
a piece of cheese.

06:31.895 --> 06:33.200
He'll be just as happy.

06:34.866 --> 06:37.854
Are you equating cheese
with the love of a good woman?

06:42.500 --> 06:44.465
You gonna turn this
into something, aren't you?

06:46.004 --> 06:47.269
Now, Corey, honey

06:47.270 --> 06:48.805
Lionel's a part
of the family, too.

06:48.806 --> 06:50.530
If you think he needs
a lady friend

06:50.531 --> 06:51.559
then we'll get him one.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.565
Come on, Lionel.

06:52.566 --> 06:53.996
Let's see if I can make
a player out of you.

06:55.860 --> 06:58.013
And stay away
from my aftershave.

07:04.332 --> 07:05.797
Uh, circle.

07:07.856 --> 07:08.825
No.

07:08.826 --> 07:10.425
Wrong again.

07:10.426 --> 07:12.555
Looks like they're letting
anyone in these days.

07:13.421 --> 07:14.665
Marvin

07:14.666 --> 07:16.537
do we have to give you
another time out?

07:19.026 --> 07:20.317
Just relax, Raven.

07:20.318 --> 07:22.336
You know, I'm not really
much of a card reader.

07:22.337 --> 07:24.835
I'm more of a future seer.

07:24.836 --> 07:26.385
Oh, clairvoyant.

07:26.386 --> 07:28.402
But I can't really turn
my visions on and off.

07:28.403 --> 07:30.165
Well, we know
you can't turn them on.

07:32.166 --> 07:36.066
I think I'm seeing a long life
of loneliness for you, Marvin.

07:38.185 --> 07:39.546
I'll tell you what, Raven.

07:39.547 --> 07:40.832
Let's do this another day.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.554
Dr. Sleevemore

07:50.555 --> 07:51.971
it's oscillating.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.025
That's what
oscillators do, Carly.

07:54.026 --> 07:55.795
You just had another
vision, didn't you?

07:55.796 --> 07:57.144
Yes, and I suggest you take
three steps

07:57.145 --> 07:58.082
to the left.

08:06.396 --> 08:07.483
Good show, Raven.

08:07.484 --> 08:09.188
You just registered a 4.7

08:09.189 --> 08:10.725
on the Sleevemore Psychic Scale

08:10.726 --> 08:13.468
and a perfect ten on the
Sleevemore thank-you scale.

08:13.469 --> 08:17.171
Thank you, but you should
see me when I'm warmed up.

08:18.737 --> 08:21.005
I have to admit
I had my doubts

08:21.006 --> 08:22.612
but you're definitely
one of us.

08:22.613 --> 08:24.782
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.

08:26.094 --> 08:26.752
Oh, my goodness

08:26.753 --> 08:28.025
this is so weird.

08:28.026 --> 08:30.112
Normally I have
to hide my visions

08:30.113 --> 08:32.452
but it's just great
to just be myself.

08:32.453 --> 08:35.306
Well, you're welcome to
be yourself here anytime.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.395
We'll meet
again tomorrow.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.595
Okay. And afterwards,
we all go out for pizza.

08:38.596 --> 08:42.265
Um, oh, man, I kind of had
something planned, but...

08:42.660 --> 08:44.227
You know what?
Never mind.

08:44.227 --> 08:45.252
Excellent.

08:45.456 --> 08:47.258
Ooh, I smell popcorn.

08:56.454 --> 08:57.879
Hey, Rae.
What's up?

08:57.881 --> 09:00.966
Guys, did you see what they put
on the school website? Look.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.363
It is so
not that funny!

09:09.365 --> 09:10.014
Shameful.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.318
I'm completely
not laughing.

09:12.651 --> 09:14.119
So, uh, Rae, where

09:14.121 --> 09:15.030
were you last night?

09:15.066 --> 09:16.396
I called
to see how you were doing

09:16.431 --> 09:17.461
but all I got
was the machine.

09:17.463 --> 09:19.265
Well, you know, actually,
I was out

09:19.296 --> 09:21.692
and I really want
to talk to you guys about it.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.928
You know how my visions
can sometimes be a problem?

09:23.930 --> 09:25.194
Sometimes?

09:25.196 --> 09:25.891
Come here.

09:25.926 --> 09:27.426
May I direct you to the screen?

09:30.226 --> 09:31.107
Yeah.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.230
Funny.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.726
Man, when you get that vision
look on your face, that...

09:38.958 --> 09:39.948
Yeah.

09:39.950 --> 09:42.528
It's always something
just really earth-shattering

09:42.530 --> 09:43.899
like a broken nail.

09:43.902 --> 09:45.186
Oh, gosh.

09:45.188 --> 09:46.581
By the way, Rae,
me and pinky...

09:47.298 --> 09:49.621
Still waiting.

09:51.356 --> 09:52.276
You done?

09:52.278 --> 09:54.360
Yeah. So, uh, what did
you want to tell us?

09:55.187 --> 09:56.735
Just that I'm not going
to be able to go bowling

09:56.737 --> 09:58.007
with you guys tonight.

09:58.009 --> 10:00.860
Oh, no, come on, Rae.
It'll be so much fun.

10:00.862 --> 10:02.549
We'll eat really
greasy food, you know

10:02.551 --> 10:04.373
wear other people's shoes.

10:04.933 --> 10:07.099
Well, I really just can't
make it with you guys tonight.

10:07.101 --> 10:08.388
I mean, you know, Corey's rat

10:08.390 --> 10:11.052
is having that whole
crisis and everything

10:11.054 --> 10:13.421
and you know how I like
to be there for him.

10:13.423 --> 10:14.954
The rat, not Corey.

10:17.473 --> 10:20.224
Well, okay, Rae,
if you're sure.

10:22.837 --> 10:23.868
Yeah, I'm sure.

10:27.650 --> 10:29.791
Okay, who ordered
the cheddar?

10:31.866 --> 10:34.295
What is this,
a rat motel?

10:34.918 --> 10:37.488
Okay, everybody--
check-out time.

10:37.490 --> 10:38.576
Move your tails.

10:39.193 --> 10:40.691
Victor, stop it.

10:40.726 --> 10:43.015
These rats are here because we
put up a flyer in the pet store

10:43.016 --> 10:44.476
and their owners
brought them over.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.507
Of course. Their owners
didn't want them either.

10:46.973 --> 10:50.027
Victor, this is a lesson
for Corey

10:50.029 --> 10:54.002
about love, compassion,
tenderness.

10:54.004 --> 10:55.266
Now, get
with the program.

10:57.141 --> 11:01.691
Lionel,
look at all these babies.

11:03.416 --> 11:05.565
And all you have to do
is pick one.

11:05.923 --> 11:07.544
How about Alberta?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.344
She's missing
her front teeth.

11:11.346 --> 11:14.161
Lionel can't wake up
to that every morning.

11:15.907 --> 11:17.871
Dad, hand me Daisy,
please.

11:24.096 --> 11:25.861
Do your thing, girl.

11:26.484 --> 11:29.915
Ooh, smells like love,
huh, Lionel?

11:39.396 --> 11:40.391
Oh, great.

11:40.426 --> 11:42.059
Table full of kids.

11:42.061 --> 11:43.335
What a joy.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.062
Raven,
check this out.

11:47.064 --> 11:48.606
Okay, make it snappy.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.406
What will it be?

11:49.408 --> 11:51.284
Uh, we'll have a small sausage

11:51.286 --> 11:52.817
and a large vegetarian, please.

11:52.819 --> 11:53.946
Uh, you know,
on second thought

11:53.982 --> 11:55.802
I think I want
to change that.

12:09.536 --> 12:11.231
Did anyone see my...?

12:17.038 --> 12:18.354
My lucky pen.

12:18.356 --> 12:19.696
I wouldn't want to lose that.

12:29.989 --> 12:31.515
Y'all know
that was wrong.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.995
It's so easy to goof
on the normys.

12:33.996 --> 12:35.220
"Normys"?

12:35.223 --> 12:38.317
That's what we call non-psychics
behind their backs.

12:38.319 --> 12:38.831
As in

12:38.833 --> 12:40.873
"How many normys does it take to
change a light bulb?"

12:41.557 --> 12:42.545
Mmm, I give up.

12:42.547 --> 12:45.977
One, but he doesn't do it
'til after it burns out.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.332
I get it-- because

12:48.334 --> 12:49.223
they can't see the future?

12:49.225 --> 12:52.322
Oh, that is... my friends...
would totally not get that.

12:52.324 --> 12:54.727
See, that's why it's
way more fun to hang out

12:54.729 --> 12:55.729
with your own kind.

12:55.766 --> 12:56.913
Oh, now, don't get me wrong.

12:56.915 --> 12:58.425
I love hanging out with my
friends.

12:58.427 --> 12:59.707
It's just that sometimes

12:59.709 --> 13:01.469
they really don't understand
what I'm going through.

13:01.471 --> 13:02.703
The normy problem.

13:02.705 --> 13:03.865
We've all
been through it.

13:05.126 --> 13:07.268
Ooh. I think
I'm feeling something.

13:07.270 --> 13:08.691
Is it a vision?

13:08.726 --> 13:10.301
No, it's more like a vibe.

13:10.303 --> 13:11.800
Just go with it.

13:11.802 --> 13:15.971
Um, okay, I see two people, but
I can't really make them out.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.244
Uh, they're very angry.

13:18.961 --> 13:20.278
Who are they?

13:21.561 --> 13:22.991
Hey, Rae.

13:23.026 --> 13:24.810
How's the rat?

13:36.693 --> 13:38.265
So, Rae, you met
some kids

13:38.267 --> 13:38.686
who were psychic.

13:38.688 --> 13:39.891
Why did you have
to blow us off?

13:39.893 --> 13:41.070
And lie to us?

13:41.072 --> 13:42.007
What's up with that?

13:42.008 --> 13:42.466
I just didn't know

13:42.468 --> 13:43.871
if you guys would click,
you know?

13:43.872 --> 13:45.431
I mean, you have totally
different interests.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.336
You like to bowl,
and-and they...

13:52.366 --> 13:53.561
Well, you know, they like

13:53.596 --> 13:55.303
to defy the physical laws
of the universe.

13:56.016 --> 13:58.161
Okay, tell me I did
not just see that.

13:58.163 --> 13:59.664
Oh, man, I know.

13:59.666 --> 14:02.166
Gosh, that was a lot of pepper.

14:02.989 --> 14:04.474
Chelsea, it
was floating.

14:04.476 --> 14:05.859
It's called telekinesis.

14:05.861 --> 14:07.765
Yeah, it's still
way too much pepper.

14:09.726 --> 14:11.701
Look, you guys have been
on my case lately

14:11.703 --> 14:13.533
and I just found some people
who understand me, and I...

14:13.535 --> 14:16.262
And you'd rather hang out
with those freaks than us.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.807
Freaks?

14:20.001 --> 14:22.396
Is that what you call me
when I'm not around?

14:22.431 --> 14:24.404
He didn't mean you, Rae.
He meant them.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.605
Okay. Cool it, Sparky.

14:29.902 --> 14:30.867
Look...

14:31.961 --> 14:33.673
I'm just like them, okay?

14:33.675 --> 14:35.842
And if they're freaks,
then so am I.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.801
Well, if you're
going to be like that

14:38.803 --> 14:40.062
then let's go,
Chelsea.

14:40.063 --> 14:41.219
Right behind you.

14:41.221 --> 14:43.711
Oh! Ow! I broke a nail.

14:43.807 --> 14:44.937
Pinky?

14:44.972 --> 14:46.799
I don't even care.

14:46.801 --> 14:48.765
Yes, you do.

14:55.302 --> 14:56.307
I can't believe

14:56.309 --> 14:58.125
you made me wear
a suit to this thing.

14:58.127 --> 14:59.066
It's a wedding.

14:59.068 --> 15:00.326
They're rats.

15:00.335 --> 15:01.350
They're in love.

15:01.352 --> 15:02.612
They're rats.

15:02.614 --> 15:04.149
Ready?

15:11.291 --> 15:13.840
Oh, honey,
doesn't she look beautiful?

15:24.902 --> 15:26.467
We are gathered here today

15:26.502 --> 15:28.479
to join this couple
in holy matrimony.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.673
Lionel, Daisy

15:30.675 --> 15:32.596
I know you two
were meant to be

15:32.598 --> 15:35.430
and if your marriage is anything
like my parents' marriage

15:35.432 --> 15:37.581
then you'll be together forever.

15:39.346 --> 15:40.681
You may get mad

15:40.683 --> 15:43.501
and want to sleep
on the other side of the cage...

15:45.188 --> 15:46.109
but hang in there.

15:46.871 --> 15:49.916
And if you ever need advice,
talk to my mom and dad.

15:49.918 --> 15:52.980
'Cause after all these years,
they're still in love.

15:55.198 --> 15:58.628
By the power vested in me
by Norm's Pet Store

15:58.630 --> 16:01.728
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

16:03.702 --> 16:06.601
Lionel, you may now
kiss the bride.

16:07.478 --> 16:08.498
Or sniff her.

16:15.880 --> 16:20.824
I'm seeing myself
surrounded by people...

16:23.394 --> 16:26.137
who really need to back up
off of me.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.045
Thanks. Okay.

16:30.048 --> 16:34.834
You're tense
and irritable and, uh...

16:36.952 --> 16:39.429
down to a 1.6
on the Seymour scale.

16:39.431 --> 16:40.994
This bears
further study.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.440
Come on, Raven.

16:44.442 --> 16:46.410
It's just us now.

16:46.412 --> 16:47.822
Tell us what's up.

16:47.824 --> 16:48.660
Nothing.

16:48.662 --> 16:49.916
That's not what
I'm getting.

16:49.918 --> 16:52.317
Okay, big shot.
Since you know everything

16:52.319 --> 16:53.596
what am I thinking?

16:53.598 --> 16:54.804
All right.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.873
You are thinking
about changing shampoos.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.942
Ah! Conditioner. Next.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.465
You're also worried
about your normy friends.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.107
Raven, it's okay.

17:08.108 --> 17:09.712
We all know
what it's like

17:09.714 --> 17:11.560
when your friends
think you're a freak.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.711
Well, actually, they think
y'all are the freaks.

17:17.824 --> 17:19.637
That is so normy.

17:20.315 --> 17:22.236
But that's how
they see us

17:22.238 --> 17:24.438
and that's why we have
to stick together.

17:25.387 --> 17:26.789
I guess you're right.

17:27.127 --> 17:28.372
It's for the best.

17:28.977 --> 17:29.920
Come on.

17:29.922 --> 17:31.809
Sparky's making
nachos.

17:37.555 --> 17:38.624
Oh, I'll get it.

17:44.167 --> 17:46.267
Uh, we come
in peace.

17:47.953 --> 17:49.300
We want to know Oh, boy.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.207
what's going on here

17:50.242 --> 17:52.211
and we're not leaving here
until we get some...

17:52.556 --> 17:54.073
nachos!

17:54.075 --> 17:55.455
That's what
I'm talking about.

17:56.921 --> 17:58.450
What are you
guys doing here?

17:58.452 --> 17:59.892
Rae, we really need
to talk to you.

17:59.894 --> 18:02.884
Uh, Raven, Dr. Sleevemore
doesn't like visitors

18:02.886 --> 18:04.211
during research hours.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.143
Research?

18:05.145 --> 18:06.740
Girl, y'all are
melting cheese!

18:07.872 --> 18:09.363
I'll handle this.

18:09.365 --> 18:10.800
Get over there.

18:10.802 --> 18:11.580
What...?

18:12.688 --> 18:14.037
Y'all here to see
the freak show?

18:14.039 --> 18:15.751
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

18:15.754 --> 18:16.514
Yeah, Rae, come on.

18:16.515 --> 18:17.402
We came to apologize

18:17.404 --> 18:18.809
and we really want
to work things out.

18:18.811 --> 18:21.678
If these are your friends,
they're our friends, too.

18:21.907 --> 18:23.600
Yeah.
Really?

18:23.602 --> 18:25.235
Mm-hmm. Yeah. You mean it?

18:25.237 --> 18:26.467
Excuse me?

18:26.469 --> 18:28.609
Who says we want
to be friends with you?

18:29.009 --> 18:31.628
But excuse me.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.452
What's that supposed to mean?

18:33.454 --> 18:35.454
It's time to leave.

18:35.456 --> 18:36.876
What if we
don't want to?

18:40.038 --> 18:41.094
Good shot, Carly.

18:41.096 --> 18:42.512
Oh, come on.

18:42.514 --> 18:44.205
So what?
So, you can throw

18:44.207 --> 18:47.013
a lousy donut at Eddie
with your minds.

18:47.016 --> 18:48.511
Whoo! So cool!

18:52.024 --> 18:53.618
That was kind
of cool, but

18:53.620 --> 18:56.186
I bet you
cannot do that

18:56.877 --> 18:57.895
with a chair.

18:58.815 --> 19:00.058
Chelsea!

19:01.242 --> 19:02.479
Will you stop it?!

19:02.481 --> 19:04.512
These are my friends
you are telepelting.

19:05.033 --> 19:06.400
We're your friends.

19:06.402 --> 19:08.314
Not if you can't accept Eddie
and Chelsea.

19:08.316 --> 19:09.551
Yeah. Come on, Rae.

19:12.029 --> 19:13.072
What?

19:13.784 --> 19:15.224
Come on, Rae,
we're leaving.

19:15.226 --> 19:17.101
Uh, yeah, I can't.

19:17.277 --> 19:18.243
Carly!

19:18.245 --> 19:21.267
Please, Raven,
don't go!

19:21.269 --> 19:22.873
You have an
amazing gift

19:22.875 --> 19:25.391
and you were making
such progress here.

19:25.394 --> 19:27.786
Hey, if my friend wants
to leave, she's leaving.

19:27.788 --> 19:29.578
Guys, some help here.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.523
Who turned off the gravity?

19:36.867 --> 19:39.258
Let her go.
She belongs with us!

19:39.260 --> 19:40.510
She belongs with us!

19:40.512 --> 19:42.139
I belong on
the ground.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.898
Let me go!

19:54.531 --> 19:56.015
Not the oscillator.

20:00.502 --> 20:02.083
I'm still making payments.

20:02.407 --> 20:03.316
Rae, are you okay?

20:03.318 --> 20:04.097
Did they hurt you?

20:04.099 --> 20:06.414
Us? You are the one
that let go.

20:06.416 --> 20:08.488
That's what happens
when you let the normys in.

20:08.490 --> 20:10.000
I'd rather be a normy
than a freak.

20:10.002 --> 20:12.311
Will you guys stop it?
It's my turn.

20:12.313 --> 20:14.281
You're not a normy,
and you're not a freak.

20:14.283 --> 20:15.683
We're all
just people.

20:15.685 --> 20:17.602
We hang out,
we go to school

20:17.604 --> 20:19.079
we play volleyball.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.590
Some better than others.

20:22.246 --> 20:23.713
The point is...

20:24.230 --> 20:25.780
is that I'm psychic, yes

20:25.782 --> 20:27.510
but that's not
all I am

20:27.512 --> 20:29.391
and that's not all
you are, either.

20:31.602 --> 20:32.831
Dr. Sleevemore

20:32.833 --> 20:33.998
thanks for all
of your help

20:34.000 --> 20:35.921
but I think it's time
for me to go.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Raven

20:38.596 --> 20:40.617
but our door's always open
for you.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.501
Thank you, Carly.

20:45.465 --> 20:46.780
That's going to be the phone.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.507
Good-bye, everybody.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.677
Wait, Raven,
I just want to say...

20:54.543 --> 20:57.260
Okay, guys, guys,
don't all think at once.

20:58.237 --> 21:01.435
We just want to say
that we're sorry.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.373
Hey, man

21:03.375 --> 21:04.771
we're sorry, too.
Yeah.

21:04.773 --> 21:06.925
Oh, and Eddie...

21:08.402 --> 21:10.666
yes, I'll go
out with you.

21:11.327 --> 21:12.492
But how did you...?

21:13.379 --> 21:15.145
Oh.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.108
You got skills, girl.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.228
I like you.

21:21.824 --> 21:22.880
Is something burning?

21:22.882 --> 21:24.089
Yeah, Eddie, it's you!

21:24.091 --> 21:25.766
What's that, man?!

21:25.768 --> 21:26.769
It's burning my...

21:26.771 --> 21:28.743
Sparky, we talked
about this.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.488
Oh, we used
to date.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.188
He's not quite
over it.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.560
Oh.

21:33.562 --> 21:37.974
Well, it-it looks like
he still has the hots for you.

21:40.873 --> 21:43.019
Ow! Carly!

21:43.021 --> 21:44.143
Ooh, I'm sorry, girl.

21:44.145 --> 21:45.310
That was me.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.400
You know, that
is a beautiful couple.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.352
Mom, Dad!

21:58.354 --> 22:00.127
Congratulations!

22:00.129 --> 22:02.309
You're grandparents!

22:06.156 --> 22:07.996
They were there a minute ago.
