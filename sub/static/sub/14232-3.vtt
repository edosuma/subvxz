Hi-yah!

00:56.223 --> 00:57.256
Whoa.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.323
You hate wood, too?

00:58.325 --> 01:00.259
Yeah, crush that wood.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.127
Wood's the worst.

01:02.129 --> 01:03.796
No, I'm practicing
for my upcoming

01:03.798 --> 01:05.264
Tang Soo Do tournament.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.132
Oh.
You see, Star,

01:07.134 --> 01:10.702
martial arts is all
about honor and discipline,

01:10.704 --> 01:14.239
which is why I'm gonna kick
Jeremy Birnbaum's butt!

01:14.241 --> 01:15.874
Jeremy Birnbaum?

01:15.876 --> 01:17.209
Isn't that the talking bear

01:17.211 --> 01:19.211
that used to rummage through
my parents' garbage?

01:19.213 --> 01:20.913
He's just this creep
in my dojo

01:20.915 --> 01:22.714
who's only any good
because his rich parents

01:22.716 --> 01:25.284
buy him fancy equipment
and private lessons.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.652
But Saturday,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.254
he's gonna get
a taste of this.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.589
Hi-yah...

01:30.591 --> 01:33.358
owwwhhh!!!

01:35.095 --> 01:36.295
( groans )

01:36.297 --> 01:38.063
This is a nightmare.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.164
If I can't fight Jeremy,

01:39.166 --> 01:40.632
he'll say I wussed out

01:40.634 --> 01:42.734
and he'll never let me
live it down.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.103
Pigtails?
Ponytail?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.771
Pigtails?
Ponytail?

01:45.773 --> 01:46.939
Wait a minute.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.140
You have a wand!

01:48.142 --> 01:50.642
You could just
fix my hand.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.112
You know,
that sort of spell

01:53.114 --> 01:54.947
is not really
in my comfort zone.

01:54.949 --> 01:59.852
I can give you a pretty
wicked set of pigtails.

02:01.321 --> 02:02.955
Pigtails?

02:02.957 --> 02:04.823
( groans )

02:04.825 --> 02:05.858
( gasps )

02:05.860 --> 02:07.659
Unless,

02:07.661 --> 02:09.995
I could look up
a bone-healing spell

02:09.997 --> 02:11.797
in the magic instruction book

02:11.799 --> 02:13.132
that came
with the wand.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.800
What?! This whole time,

02:14.802 --> 02:16.268
you had a magic
instruction book?

02:16.270 --> 02:19.004
Yep, whenever a previous
owner of the wand

02:19.006 --> 02:22.174
mastered a spell, they scribbled
it down in here.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.810
But it's a complete
disorganized mess.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.146
It's gonna take me
forever to find--

02:27.148 --> 02:28.180
Oh! Here it is.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.181
Really?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.315
Hmm.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.152
It's in an ancient
language.

02:33.154 --> 02:37.990
Releasio, Demonius,
Infestica!

02:37.992 --> 02:39.858
Aaah...aaah!

02:39.860 --> 02:41.193
I can feel it working!

02:41.195 --> 02:43.395
My fingers are tingling!

02:45.165 --> 02:46.798
( screams )

02:46.800 --> 02:47.833
( gasps )

02:47.835 --> 02:48.834
Don't worry.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.002
There must be a spell in here

02:50.004 --> 02:51.170
that can change it back.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.271
I can fix it.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.181
( yawns )

03:03.883 --> 03:05.817
( groans )

03:10.256 --> 03:11.323
Ow.

03:12.158 --> 03:15.260
( screaming )

03:21.201 --> 03:22.734
( yawns )

03:22.736 --> 03:23.802
Morning, Marco.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.204
Morning, monster arm.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.905
I was up all night

03:26.907 --> 03:28.941
but I haven't found a way
to reverse the spell.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.346
( indistinct chatter )

03:36.749 --> 03:38.250
LARS: Hey, kid.
I got a joke for you.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.452
What's the most important
meal of the day?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.387
Huh?

03:42.389 --> 03:43.388
It's breakfast.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.324
( laughs )

03:45.326 --> 03:47.159
That's a good one, Lars.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.797
( laughs )

03:51.799 --> 03:53.232
( everyone gasps )

03:53.234 --> 03:54.499
Who did that?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.034
Uh...

03:56.036 --> 03:57.035
No one hits La--

03:57.037 --> 03:58.203
( grunting )

04:00.039 --> 04:01.940
( crying )

04:07.113 --> 04:09.815
I, sir,
am in your debt.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.216
You're a hero!

04:11.218 --> 04:13.285
( cheering )

04:13.287 --> 04:15.153
Can I check out
that arm?

04:15.155 --> 04:16.822
Uh, sure.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.889
I want it to be
my boyfriend.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.057
Me too!

04:19.059 --> 04:20.125
High five!

04:21.327 --> 04:23.395
( breathing heavily )

04:25.164 --> 04:26.198
STAR: Aha!

04:26.200 --> 04:27.332
I found it.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.334
A reverse
tentacle spell.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.435
I think.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.337
Uh, maybe you
should practice

04:32.339 --> 04:33.505
on something first.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.108
Way ahead of you.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.278
Returnio, Armius,
Normalritecus!

04:42.482 --> 04:43.482
( gasps )

04:43.484 --> 04:46.285
Uh, I'm going to bed now.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.221
Don't worry.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.290
I'll get it.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.860
Returnius,
Armius, Normalrinny!

04:57.196 --> 04:58.864
Ugh.

05:02.235 --> 05:06.438
STAR: Returnio,
Armius, Normalrino!

05:11.210 --> 05:12.344
( gasps )

05:14.380 --> 05:16.214
Marco!

05:18.584 --> 05:20.352
673,

05:20.354 --> 05:23.188
674, 675.

05:23.190 --> 05:26.258
I did it, I did it, I did it,
I did it, I did it!

05:26.260 --> 05:28.060
Hey, I think
this monster arm

05:28.062 --> 05:30.262
might actually help me
take out Jeremy.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.364
Hi-yah!

05:32.366 --> 05:35.267
Wait.
You're gonna fight
with  <i>that?</i>

05:35.269 --> 05:37.369
That sounds
kind of unfair.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.272
Oh, funny how you
never have a problem

05:40.274 --> 05:42.240
using your magic
when it benefits  <i>you,</i>

05:42.242 --> 05:44.309
but as soon as it
gives  <i>me </i> an advantage,

05:44.311 --> 05:45.877
you wanna take it away.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.513
Marco, I think that arm's
a bad influence on you.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.382
And I think
you should go.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.983
What?

05:51.985 --> 05:53.251
Fine, but I don't--

05:53.253 --> 05:54.252
( door slams )

05:54.254 --> 05:57.322
Huh. Man,
what does she know?

05:59.892 --> 06:02.627
Don't listen to her,
she's just jealous.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.496
What? You can talk?

06:04.498 --> 06:06.431
You don't need
her anymore.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.968
I can give you everything
you ever dreamed of.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.436
- Really?
- First,

06:11.438 --> 06:14.239
we're gonna destroy
that little punk Jeremy.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.640
Yeah.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.509
Then we're gonna get
Jackie Lynn Thomas

06:17.511 --> 06:19.511
- to like you.
- Yeah!

06:19.513 --> 06:21.880
And then we're gonna
slaughter all humans

06:21.882 --> 06:24.049
and feast on their bowels!!!

06:24.051 --> 06:25.350
Yeah!!!

06:25.352 --> 06:26.485
Wait. What?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.653
I mean, uh,
win the tournament!

06:28.655 --> 06:30.355
Yeah!

06:31.891 --> 06:33.325
STAR: Excuse me.
MAN: Ooh, watch it.

06:33.327 --> 06:34.359
STAR: Sorry.
GIRL: Hey! Ow!

06:34.361 --> 06:37.162
Sorry, sorry...sorry.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.097
Are you okay,
Star?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.565
You look  <i>terrible.</i>

06:40.567 --> 06:42.634
And I have
very low standards.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.637
I've been up
for two nights,

06:45.639 --> 06:48.173
trying to fix
his monster arm,

06:48.175 --> 06:49.975
then he gets mad.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.309
And then I got
to come here

06:51.311 --> 06:54.279
and watch him karate,
you know?

06:54.281 --> 06:57.315
Allow me to introduce
our first competitor,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.317
Jeremy Birnbaum!

06:59.319 --> 07:00.585
( music playing )

07:00.587 --> 07:02.387
Hi-yah!

07:02.389 --> 07:04.122
That's Jeremy?

07:04.124 --> 07:06.258
FERGUSON: That kid can't be any
more than eight years old.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.260
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

07:08.262 --> 07:09.928
We love you, son.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.363
Shut it, Mom!

07:11.365 --> 07:12.531
And his opponent,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.966
Marco Diaz.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.535
( audience gasps )

07:16.537 --> 07:19.104
Now that's
an appendage.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.472
Hey, wait!

07:20.474 --> 07:22.340
He's got a monster arm!
That's not fair!

07:22.342 --> 07:24.176
Yeah! Pretty cool,
right?

07:28.014 --> 07:29.080
Hey-oh!

07:30.049 --> 07:31.316
Whoa!!!

07:32.518 --> 07:34.252
( groans )

07:34.254 --> 07:35.654
Point, Diaz.

07:35.656 --> 07:39.257
Where are your private
lessons now, Jeremy?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.725
Huh?

07:40.727 --> 07:43.061
( laughs )

07:43.063 --> 07:44.196
He's beaten.

07:44.198 --> 07:46.565
- Now, finish him.
- What?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.567
This is what
you've always wanted.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.968
Destroy him.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.369
Eat his bowels.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.038
Not my bowels!

07:53.040 --> 07:54.439
I love my bowels!

07:54.441 --> 07:57.209
Hey, listen, I just wanted
to win the tournament

07:57.211 --> 07:59.377
so he wouldn't
make fun of me.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.446
If you're too weak
to finish him.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.315
I'll do it
myself.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.616
( screams )

08:04.618 --> 08:07.085
Star was right about you.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.121
You  <i>are </i> a bad influence!

08:10.123 --> 08:12.524
And you
are pathetic.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.626
Whoa!!!

08:16.429 --> 08:18.096
Point, Diaz.

08:19.599 --> 08:22.100
Star?
You can change
it back now.

08:23.302 --> 08:24.736
BOTH: Star!

08:24.738 --> 08:26.004
( both gasp )

08:28.274 --> 08:30.108
Star,
you gotta wake up!

08:30.110 --> 08:31.176
(crying) Star!

08:33.145 --> 08:36.281
Star!!!

08:36.283 --> 08:37.482
Stop hitting yourself.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.351
Stop hitting yourself.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.186
Hey, wake up!

08:41.188 --> 08:42.287
Here,
try this.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.322
Oh, thank you so much.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.790
No,
on Star.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.158
Oh, right.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.296
MARCO: Star!

08:55.334 --> 08:58.036
Returnio, Armius, Normalrino!

09:01.440 --> 09:03.508
Returnio, Armius,
Normalrino!

09:10.516 --> 09:11.650
Hai.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.824
Whoa!

09:23.229 --> 09:26.097
ARM (laughing):
I could do this
all day.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.233
Ahh! He's too wiggly!

09:32.238 --> 09:33.738
( grunts )

09:40.379 --> 09:42.213
Now!

09:42.215 --> 09:45.584
Returnio, Armius, Normalrino!

09:45.586 --> 09:47.319
You'll never get rid of me!

09:47.321 --> 09:49.254
I'm part of you now.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.689
You can treat the symptoms

09:50.691 --> 09:53.658
but you'll never cure
the virus...

09:55.761 --> 09:57.529
Ugh.

09:57.531 --> 10:01.099
Marco, are you okay?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.601
( gasps )

10:02.603 --> 10:04.202
My arm!

10:04.204 --> 10:05.503
My beautiful arm.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.873
It's back to normal.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.209
( grunts )
And totally broken.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.210
JEREMY: Broken arm?

10:12.212 --> 10:15.747
Ha! Well,
it looks like I win.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.822
Brass knuckles?
Seriously?

10:24.824 --> 10:26.858
Brass?

10:26.860 --> 10:28.293
They're gold.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.495
You boys have brought
shame and dishonor

10:30.497 --> 10:32.297
to this great
and noble sport.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.431
'Tis a sad day

10:33.433 --> 10:36.134
for strip mall dojos
everywhere.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.638
( grunts )

10:41.240 --> 10:43.341
Oh, bravo, son.

10:43.343 --> 10:47.445
Argh. I wish I could
fight  <i>you, </i> Mom.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.181
What a turd.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.317
Ahh. Sorry.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.252
I should've listened
to you, Star.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.754
I know.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.356
Hey, uh, when the monster arm
said he'd be back,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.425
that's nothing
to worry about, right?

11:00.427 --> 11:03.795
Uh...probably not?

11:12.905 --> 11:15.240
( yawns )

11:15.242 --> 11:16.775
ALL: Surprise!

11:16.777 --> 11:20.478
Happy 47th day
on Earth, Star.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.647
Aaah! A party? For me?

11:22.649 --> 11:24.749
I can't believe it!
You can't?

11:24.751 --> 11:26.785
We've done this every day
since you got here.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.786
Here, Star.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.487
I made you a cake.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.756
And I wrote
you a poem.

11:31.758 --> 11:35.226
Our lives were so small
and puny,

11:35.228 --> 11:37.629
till this angel arrived from...
( doorbell rings)

11:37.631 --> 11:39.631
Ah, thank goodness.

11:40.666 --> 11:41.666
Hello!

11:41.668 --> 11:43.968
It is I, Gustav.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.904
No way!

11:45.906 --> 11:49.708
Ho-ho! Marco,
my American friend.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.518
Look who's here!

12:00.520 --> 12:03.888
- How wonderful.
- What a wonderful surprise!

12:03.890 --> 12:06.357
We've missed you
so much.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.692
Um, hi.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.294
Oh, hello.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.729
I am Gustav.

12:10.731 --> 12:14.399
I was Diaz's exchange
student last year.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.701
What? But I thought
I was your one and only

12:16.703 --> 12:18.002
foreign exchange student.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.571
Not even close.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.540
I mean, who did you think
all these kids were?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.742
Hmm.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.977
I brought gifts
from Scandinavia.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.011
For Mrs. D,

12:27.013 --> 12:29.347
a pair of clogs.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.349
For Marco, the handheld game,

12:31.351 --> 12:33.384
Lederhosen Tycoon.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.853
And for Mr. Diaz,

12:34.855 --> 12:37.422
a genuine Viking helmet.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.490
( gasps )

12:40.259 --> 12:42.527
And for you,
nothing.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.029
I did not know
you existed.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.364
Oh.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.500
Oh, Mrs. D,

12:48.502 --> 12:50.001
you've gotten
so thin.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.970
I need to fatten
you up.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.638
Gustav.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.708
Come, everyone, and I will cook
you my meatballs.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.576
MARCO: Oh, Gustav.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.482
The Scandinavian monsoons
were over,

13:04.484 --> 13:07.652
but the danger
had just begun.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.987
The iceberg was sinking.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.822
Heedless of my own peril,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.357
I disrobed.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.392
I dove into the freezing fjord

13:14.394 --> 13:17.562
and I carried Yuri
back to his mother.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.431
( gasps )

13:20.433 --> 13:21.800
Ooh.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.001
Oh.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.303
Whoa.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.738
Meh.

13:26.740 --> 13:27.839
Marco, think fast.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.311
So, uh, Gustav,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.046
where exactly
are you from?

13:35.048 --> 13:38.049
How much do you know
about Europe?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.717
I know it's a place.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.085
I'm pretty sure.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.321
Oh, well then,

13:43.323 --> 13:46.424
I come from the country
of Scandinavia.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.626
It is a land where Vikings
teach gym class

13:48.628 --> 13:50.762
and everyone
has a pet penguin,

13:50.764 --> 13:52.096
even if you
don't like penguins.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.798
Oop, too bad,
here's your penguin.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.066
MARCO:
Hey, Gustav, I'm open.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.368
Meatball me!

13:57.370 --> 13:59.337
Ooh, Now me, Gustav.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.505
Now me!

14:01.140 --> 14:02.574
( laughs )

14:04.376 --> 14:06.845
Are you sure
those are cooked?

14:06.847 --> 14:10.081
( laughs )

14:10.083 --> 14:12.116
Over here!

14:12.118 --> 14:13.651
Just think,

14:13.653 --> 14:15.753
three more weeks of this!

14:19.525 --> 14:21.893
( yawns )

14:21.895 --> 14:23.394
ALL: Surprise!

14:23.396 --> 14:25.363
Aah! A party for me--

14:25.365 --> 14:28.399
ALL: Happy second day
of your visit, Gustav.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.134
Oh, Diaz family.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.637
You are so full
of pleasantness.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.673
( all chanting )
Gustav, Gustav, Gustav, Gustav!

14:35.675 --> 14:36.741
( laughing )

14:38.510 --> 14:39.644
Huh?

14:41.814 --> 14:43.681
What?

14:43.683 --> 14:47.085
Oh, look at you.
Such a curious girl.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.486
Now, eat your cake

14:48.488 --> 14:51.422
and mind your own business.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.157
Okay.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.059
More cake for everyone!

14:55.061 --> 14:56.494
Marco, listen.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.897
I think there's something
off about Gustav.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.066
I found Scandinavian books
and language tapes in his bag.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.069
Why would someone need
to learn his own language?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.404
Uh...

15:06.406 --> 15:07.171
Why is he always
making meatballs?

15:07.173 --> 15:08.573
Meatballs aren't so great.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.041
I can make things too.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.979
Uh, jealous much?

15:14.981 --> 15:15.980
GUSTAV: Hey, Marco!

15:15.982 --> 15:18.082
Think fast!

15:18.084 --> 15:20.451
I hope he  <i>never </i> leaves!

15:20.453 --> 15:21.886
( Mom laughing )

15:21.888 --> 15:23.121
Oh, no, thank you.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.123
Oh! That's
a very big bite.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.791
Ugh.

15:31.730 --> 15:32.897
( phone ringing )

15:46.979 --> 15:48.146
Huh?
Huh?

15:50.082 --> 15:51.849
( snoring )

16:02.161 --> 16:03.561
Oh, Star.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.229
We're about to--
Whaa!

16:07.199 --> 16:09.167
( breathing heavily )

16:12.237 --> 16:14.005
What's going on?

16:14.007 --> 16:15.073
I've been awake for days

16:15.075 --> 16:16.541
spying on Gustav,

16:16.543 --> 16:18.476
and I'm this close
to figuring out

16:18.478 --> 16:20.178
what he's plotting.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.145
What?!

16:21.147 --> 16:23.147
His stories don't add up, Marco.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.483
Penguins, icebergs, polar bears.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.652
What the heck
is a polar bear?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.988
And he's making
phone calls, Marco.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.155
Phone calls!

16:31.157 --> 16:33.791
He's up to something
terrible!

16:34.793 --> 16:38.229
You have lost your mind.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.497
But if you find it,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.165
we're meeting Gustav
for a picnic

16:41.167 --> 16:42.834
at Isolation Point,

16:42.836 --> 16:46.270
where no one
can hear you scream...

16:46.272 --> 16:47.905
with enjoyment.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.810
<i>Oh, Mrs. D,</i>

16:52.812 --> 16:54.245
<i>you've gotten so thin.</i>

16:54.247 --> 16:56.147
Gustav, Gustav, Gustav, Gustav!

16:56.149 --> 16:57.615
<i>Now, eat your cake</i>

16:57.617 --> 16:59.250
<i>and mind your own business.</i>

16:59.252 --> 17:01.953
<i>Meatballs, meatballs,</i>
<i>meatballs.</i>

17:01.955 --> 17:04.022
<i>Isolation Point.</i>

17:04.024 --> 17:05.623
<i>Here is your penguin.</i>

17:05.625 --> 17:08.526
<i>I need to fatten you up.</i>

17:10.029 --> 17:11.963
( screams )

17:11.965 --> 17:14.932
Gustav's not taking them
<i>on </i> a picnic,

17:14.934 --> 17:16.868
they  <i>are </i> the picnic!

17:16.870 --> 17:18.102
( car starts )

17:18.104 --> 17:19.270
( tires screeching )

17:19.272 --> 17:20.705
Wait!

17:22.975 --> 17:24.308
Bunny Rabbit Blast!

17:30.616 --> 17:33.251
You're all going to die!

17:33.253 --> 17:36.921
♪ Oh, we're gonna eat some
meatballs in the woods ♪

17:36.923 --> 17:39.057
♪ Yeah, we're gonna eat some
meatballs in the woods ♪

17:39.059 --> 17:40.324
♪ In the woods

17:40.326 --> 17:42.193
♪ Yeah, we're gonna eat

17:42.195 --> 17:45.029
♪ Yeah, we're gonna
eat some meatballs... ♪

17:53.338 --> 17:55.640
( thunder rumbles )

18:05.184 --> 18:08.319
I knew you were up to no good,
meatball boy!

18:08.321 --> 18:09.987
( screams )

18:09.989 --> 18:12.190
Get back here!

18:12.192 --> 18:13.624
( panting )

18:13.626 --> 18:14.792
Dagger Heart Blast!

18:14.794 --> 18:16.661
Glow Worm Blast!

Ha ha ha!

STAR: Glitter Dragon Escalation!

18:40.786 --> 18:43.121
Give it up, Gustav!

18:43.123 --> 18:45.223
( screams )

18:46.625 --> 18:48.059
Whoa!!!

18:49.194 --> 18:51.329
It's over, Gustav.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.999
I know you aren't
who you say you are.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.634
It's true!

18:56.636 --> 18:58.970
I'm full of lies!

18:58.972 --> 19:02.874
So, you admit you're planning
to eat the Diazes?

19:02.876 --> 19:05.209
Yes, yes.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.177
Wait, what?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.279
No, I don't want
to eat them.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.780
But you said--

19:09.782 --> 19:12.250
I mean, I'm not
from Scandinavia.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.019
Truth is my name
is Charlie Booth,

19:15.021 --> 19:18.689
and I'm just a guy
from Bakersfieldville.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.391
Nobody's heard of it.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.759
( all sigh )

19:24.062 --> 19:26.264
GUSTAV: Back home,
I'm just another boring face

19:26.266 --> 19:28.132
in a  <i>really </i> boring crowd.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.201
It's not a good place
for a talented guy like me.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.203
But what about
the phone calls?

19:32.205 --> 19:34.739
And the axe?
And those meatballs?

19:34.741 --> 19:37.208
Well, the phone calls
were to my meat guy,

19:37.210 --> 19:38.876
but he wouldn't pick up.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.144
MAN:  <i>I'm the meat guy,</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

19:40.146 --> 19:41.145
Bro, it's me.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.015
Come on, man,
I need the meat.

19:44.017 --> 19:48.019
The axe was to cut firewood
for today's feast.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.189
As for the meatballs,
my dream is to become a chef

19:51.191 --> 19:53.324
and open a restaurant
in Bakersfieldville

19:53.326 --> 19:57.028
that uses spices and flavors.
All: Yay!

19:57.030 --> 20:00.097
So that's why I ran away
and moved in with the Diazes.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.201
But what about measuring
the Diazes in their sleep?

20:03.203 --> 20:06.204
Uh...

20:06.206 --> 20:08.272
( horn honks )

20:08.274 --> 20:11.142
Star?
What a pleasant surprise!

20:11.144 --> 20:12.710
You made it!

20:12.712 --> 20:14.212
Yeah, I did.

20:14.214 --> 20:17.281
And I came here to tell you
something about Gustav.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.449
( gasps )

20:18.451 --> 20:19.850
( laughs )

20:24.723 --> 20:27.725
He's made you
even  <i>more </i> meatballs!

20:27.727 --> 20:29.227
- Yes!
- Fantastic!

20:29.229 --> 20:31.195
Oh, meatballs.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.030
Phew.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.799
Thanks for not blowing
my cover, Star.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.902
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

20:37.904 --> 20:41.439
Well, as a matter of fact,
Charlie, there is.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.807
Bye!

20:42.809 --> 20:44.242
Bye-bye, Gustav!

20:44.244 --> 20:45.276
Bye!

20:45.278 --> 20:46.444
ALL: Bye-bye!

20:46.446 --> 20:47.445
( indistinct chatter )

20:47.447 --> 20:49.080
Gonna miss you, bud.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.748
MAN: Hey, get off the road!

20:50.750 --> 20:52.950
See you next year,
Gustav!

20:52.952 --> 20:54.452
Or not,
you never know.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.287
Bye now.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.456
MR. AND MRS. DIAZ: Surprise!

20:58.458 --> 21:02.560
Happy 51st day on Earth, Star.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.263
Ah! A party for me?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.465
Who wants cake?

21:07.467 --> 21:10.101
I'm sorry your favorite
exchange student

21:10.103 --> 21:11.269
had to leave so soon.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.270
You kidding?

21:12.272 --> 21:13.271
You're my favorite.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.338
Aww.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.207
I will miss
seeing him, though.

21:16.209 --> 21:19.944
That guy is just
so...  <i>real.</i>

21:19.946 --> 21:21.479
( doorbell rings )

21:21.481 --> 21:23.281
Bonjour.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.282
Francois!

21:24.284 --> 21:26.317
Hey, what a great surprise.
