WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:05.135
- Previously on "The Flash"...
- Dr. Harrison "Nash" Wells.

00:05.179 --> 00:06.789
- I'm searching
for an artifact

00:06.832 --> 00:08.269
that just happens
to contain Eternium.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.140
- The disappearance
of Sue Dearbon.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.490
- I don't think I've ever seen
you this devoted to a case.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.362
- HLH isn't just
my mother's disease.

00:14.405 --> 00:15.928
Now it's killing me.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.974
You're a dead man, too,
aren't you, Barry?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.890
- The only timeline
where everyone survives

00:20.933 --> 00:22.065
was the one where I died.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.675
And none of you
can try and save me.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.982
- Analysis
of Mitch Romero's blood

00:26.026 --> 00:27.984
reveals that this substance
appears to heal

00:28.028 --> 00:30.291
any and all weaknesses
in the human body,

00:30.334 --> 00:31.161
including HLH.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.381
I need more.

00:46.568 --> 00:47.873
Dr. Rosso.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.136
- Didn't mean
to sneak up on you like that.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.398
- Well, it's almost Halloween.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.226
I guess we're all due
for a good scare, right?

00:54.271 --> 00:56.143
What brings you here so late?

00:56.186 --> 00:58.841
- I'm meeting up
with a colleague.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.191
Yeah, I told him I'd be
here half an hour ago,

01:01.235 --> 01:03.193
so...if you'll excuse me.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.326
- Of course.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.501
It's good to see you.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.986
I wish it didn't
have to be this way.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.294
- And you're okay
with all of this?

02:00.337 --> 02:02.252
- No, but...

02:03.993 --> 02:06.256
I have to accept
that there are still others

02:06.300 --> 02:07.692
out there that we can save.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.608
- Yeah, guys, look,
six weeks from now,

02:10.652 --> 02:13.089
all of our lives
are gonna be on the line,

02:13.133 --> 02:15.178
so we have to be prepared.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.485
- Yes, but what about him?

02:17.528 --> 02:18.921
I'm not just gonna wait around

02:18.964 --> 02:21.271
for him to get vaporized
by anti-matter.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.273
We should be doing something
to try to save his life.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.101
- You can't.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.494
You can't, Cisco.

02:26.537 --> 02:29.540
That's why I need you
to stop worrying about me.

02:32.543 --> 02:33.762
- If Barry had
any other option,

02:33.805 --> 02:36.199
we'd be doing it.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.635
I think you
gotta get behind this.

02:41.248 --> 02:44.338
- Yeah.
I am.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.084
- How do you convince
your best friend

02:52.128 --> 02:53.825
not to save your life?

02:53.869 --> 02:56.915
- You're the teacher.
You'll find a way.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.309
- Well,
he's gonna have to wait.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.355
It's CCPD.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.713
- There he is.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.105
So much for my day off.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.020
- What do we got?
- It's a creepy one.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.371
Somebody broke into this
facility last night,

03:17.414 --> 03:18.415
and stole 10 liters of blood.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.504
- There's no security footage?

03:20.548 --> 03:22.550
- There's no cameras
in this part of the hospital.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.378
- You think
this is meta-related?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.118
- I'm asking you.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.077
- I mean...

03:28.120 --> 03:30.340
meta-thieves usually
make a way bigger mess.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.429
See this lock?

03:32.473 --> 03:35.867
The way this is sheared,
a power saw could've done this.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.305
I don't know.
I mean, maybe it was just some

03:38.348 --> 03:40.481
kids pulling a Halloween prank.

03:40.524 --> 03:41.873
- Good.
I thought we were dealing

03:41.917 --> 03:44.006
with some kind of meta-vampire.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.443
- Just a normal criminal
with a diseased mind.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.097
- Well, since I am captain,

03:48.140 --> 03:50.012
I'm gonna go watch
the second half of the game.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.753
I'm gonna leave this to you,
all right?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.450
- Mm-hmm.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.843
- You okay?

03:56.932 --> 04:00.544
- Yeah. You know, just this
Crisis that's coming.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.199
Cisco's not taking it so great.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.331
- Let me guess which part.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.289
Cisco is a whole lot like you.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.553
It is in his nature
to want to save lives.

04:09.597 --> 04:13.035
Especially under
these circumstances.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.384
I'll see you later.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.168
- Right.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.520
Thanks, Joe.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.043
- Thanks for what?

04:21.086 --> 04:23.132
- I think I know how
to get through to Cisco.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.832
- Tests are conclusive.

04:27.876 --> 04:33.011
The peculiar black blood
I absorbed from Mitch Romero

04:33.055 --> 04:37.407
temporarily cured
the HLH cancer in my blood,

04:37.451 --> 04:40.454
but it wasn't enough.

04:40.497 --> 04:41.977
I need more blood

04:42.020 --> 04:44.545
in order to create
a permanent cure

04:44.588 --> 04:46.851
to save my life.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.898
Adding Romero's cells
to this new blood

04:49.941 --> 04:53.423
should be the key to rebuilding
my cellular structure.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.177
I only hope
I have enough time.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.048
- Why didn't you tell me?
It's brilliant.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.093
- You're my son.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.964
You're supposed
to be impressed.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.837
You're going to do beautiful
things for this world.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.448
- Are you okay?

05:19.754 --> 05:21.495
Mom?

05:23.671 --> 05:26.064
- My condition is terminal.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.895
- I got your text.
What is it now?

05:30.939 --> 05:35.639
- I know you're upset
about this Crisis.

05:35.683 --> 05:36.640
And I've been
thinking about it,

05:36.684 --> 05:38.076
and you're right.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.036
We can do more
than prepare for a fight.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.344
You can save a life.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.522
- I knew you'd come around.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.175
- No, Cisco, not...

05:50.219 --> 05:51.655
it's not me.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.703
We're gonna save Ramsey Rosso.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.971
- Here's the thing.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.495
We've done some insane things
at S.T.A.R. Labs

06:05.539 --> 06:06.801
over the last few years,

06:06.844 --> 06:08.846
but curing a rare blood cancer,

06:08.890 --> 06:11.762
that is beyond our resources.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.417
- So we just shouldn't try?

06:14.461 --> 06:18.639
- So we try
and somehow succeed,

06:18.682 --> 06:21.903
are we supposed to spend
the rest of your time here

06:21.946 --> 06:24.645
trying to save everyone who's
been diagnosed with cancer?

06:24.688 --> 06:26.298
- We start with one man.

06:28.039 --> 06:30.912
Look, you heard what
Caitlin said about Ramsey.

06:30.955 --> 06:34.002
He's one of the most brilliant
doctors on the planet.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.180
I need you to back me on this.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.009
You'll understand soon enough.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.750
Look, I...

06:42.793 --> 06:47.363
what would it take to cure HLH?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.452
- Honestly...

06:49.496 --> 06:51.323
an act of God.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.673
- Or...

06:56.851 --> 06:58.200
An act of science.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.506
And I know just where
to find one.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.072
- I'm assuming
this is the Wells

07:01.116 --> 07:02.378
that you were
telling me about.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.684
- Yep. Nash Wells.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.642
Multiversal explorer

07:05.686 --> 07:07.601
and provider
of scientific miracles.

07:07.644 --> 07:10.647
You, I'm guessing,

07:10.691 --> 07:13.563
are Barry Allen, the Flash.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.521
- How did he...how did you--

07:14.564 --> 07:15.609
- Hidden surveillance device.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.914
- You bugged S.T.A.R. Labs?

07:16.958 --> 07:20.483
- No, no, not exactly.
I...

07:20.527 --> 07:21.484
I bugged you.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.616
- No, you didn't.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.095
- Yeah, I did.

07:24.139 --> 07:26.228
Fellas, I've been listening
to your conversations,

07:26.271 --> 07:27.925
and I have a proposition.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.971
Now I need an anti-vibrational
crypto-circuit

07:30.014 --> 07:31.320
to complete my work
on this Earth,

07:31.363 --> 07:32.713
You need help
with your mission, right?

07:32.756 --> 07:33.757
Well, you build me my circuit,

07:33.801 --> 07:35.106
'cause I know
you have the capacity,

07:35.150 --> 07:37.021
and I will lead you
to something priceless

07:37.065 --> 07:39.328
that will surely help
your mission.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.721
- Your work?

07:40.764 --> 07:44.551
What's your work?
- It's thermic excavation.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.248
- You're a cosmic myth-buster

07:46.291 --> 07:49.469
who also happens
to be a geologist?

07:49.512 --> 07:50.513
- Sure.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.514
- Sure.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.602
- Sidebar.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.388
Red flag city.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.347
- Yeah.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.957
Then again...

08:00.001 --> 08:02.525
Wells usually shows up
for a reason.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.918
- Fellas?
- Yeah.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.789
- You're aware
he's still bugged, right?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.269
- Where is the bug?
I don't see anything.

08:07.312 --> 08:08.531
- Not in your shoe.
I can tell you that much.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.533
- Let's just say
that we trust you.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.361
- We don't.
- Which we obviously don't.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.841
- Understood.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.538
- What are you offering?

08:15.582 --> 08:16.800
- I'm offering you
something that will help

08:16.844 --> 08:18.541
save Ramsey Rosso's life.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.594
- Have I got
something for you.

08:27.637 --> 08:28.595
- Amazon packages?

08:28.638 --> 08:29.944
- No.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.032
- You know that case
that you've been working on

08:31.075 --> 08:32.555
for the last couple months?

08:32.599 --> 08:33.948
The Dearbon woman?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.819
Well,
I know it's been cold lately,

08:35.863 --> 08:38.779
so I have a little
Halloween treat for you.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.041
A lead.
- Yeah?

08:40.084 --> 08:41.390
- Yeah.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.696
I interviewed this accountant
in Midway City

08:42.739 --> 08:43.697
that works
at the security firm,

08:43.740 --> 08:45.612
and one of their guards

08:45.655 --> 08:47.918
was working a charity event
and claims to have seen someone

08:47.962 --> 08:50.225
that sounds like Sue Dearbon,

08:50.268 --> 08:54.664
so Cecile pulled a favor
and got an eye witness report.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.449
- Cool.
Thanks, Iris.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.240
- Need something else?

09:07.416 --> 09:08.765
- No.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.289
No, that was it.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.336
- Cool.

09:15.729 --> 09:19.123
- All right, yeah.
Cool, I will see you later.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.263
- Production of blood serum
is complete.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.701
It appears identical
to the substance

09:31.745 --> 09:33.660
I absorbed from Mitch Romero.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.446
If this works,

09:37.489 --> 09:40.797
I could hold the cure
not just for myself,

09:40.841 --> 09:43.539
but for all those suffering
from HLH cancer.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.041
It's not working.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.261
I failed.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.002
I failed.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.224
- It's in there,
McCulloch Technologies.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.660
- What is?

10:17.704 --> 10:20.315
- Well, this extremely rare
bio-regenerative serum

10:20.358 --> 10:22.665
capable of healing
organic tissue,

10:22.709 --> 10:23.840
no matter what the harm.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.712
So for your purposes,
what you do,

10:25.755 --> 10:27.627
you simply inject it into
your friend's healthy cells,

10:27.670 --> 10:28.976
those healthy cells replicate,

10:29.019 --> 10:30.847
they replace
the unhealthy cells.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.893
Presto.
Instant miracle.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.895
Although, don't wait till
your buddy's too far gone

10:34.938 --> 10:38.115
because then it might not work.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.856
- This sounds way too good
to be true.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.336
- Yeah, he's right.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.685
I mean, how did
McCulloch Technologies

10:42.729 --> 10:44.556
develop something
this advanced?

10:44.600 --> 10:45.906
- They didn't develop it.
They stole it.

10:45.949 --> 10:46.994
It's from Swan Moon, the--

10:47.037 --> 10:47.995
- The Dominator home planet?

10:48.038 --> 10:49.736
- Yeah, that's the one.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.476
Yeah, recovered from some
invasion three years ago.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.477
Anyway, blah blah blah.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.783
You guys in, or what?

10:53.827 --> 10:54.915
- Well, how dangerous a weapon
could this be

10:54.958 --> 10:56.046
in the wrong hands?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.570
- On a scale of one to ten...

10:58.614 --> 11:00.181
12.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.662
- We gotta get our hands
on this thing.

11:03.445 --> 11:06.448
- All right, I'm gonna disable
the exterior security cameras.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.932
- He goes right
through the door.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.108
Huh.
That's cool.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.240
- How'd you know
the stuff was here?

11:16.284 --> 11:18.852
- Kid, multiversal explorer.
We need to know things.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.855
- And the serum?

11:21.898 --> 11:24.858
Could it protect someone
from anti-matter?

11:25.423 --> 11:26.903
- I expect
that goes without saying.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.994
Whoo!

11:31.038 --> 11:32.343
- Cameras are down.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.695
- All right, boys.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.962
Here's where the fun begins.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.879
All right.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.184
Speedster, come on.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.969
Speed us to the storage room.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.013
- No, I can't.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.449
- What do you mean you can't?

11:51.493 --> 11:53.060
- There are localized
meta-dampeners

11:53.103 --> 11:54.191
all over this building,
all right?

11:54.235 --> 11:55.932
My powers are useless in here.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.412
- It means you're useless here.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.849
- We don't have
to make your circuit.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.024
- Is that right, tough guy?

12:01.068 --> 12:02.504
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do

12:02.547 --> 12:03.810
if you don't make my circuit,
and I don't have--

12:03.853 --> 12:05.986
- Hey, numbskulls,
knock it off.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.640
- Freeze!
Both of you.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.642
- Both of us?

12:21.653 --> 12:23.046
- So we can explain.

12:23.090 --> 12:26.571
- I don't think they're gonna
ask questions first.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.758
- Nash?

12:39.976 --> 12:40.977
- Hey, fellas.

12:41.021 --> 12:41.978
So your auditory nerves--

12:42.022 --> 12:43.327
- What?

12:43.371 --> 12:46.766
- Your ears will be fine
in a couple of minutes.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.029
Unlike these two.
Now...

12:49.072 --> 12:50.944
where were we?

12:52.815 --> 12:54.121
- All right, let's hurry up.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.949
There's another life
at stake besides our own.

13:08.875 --> 13:09.919
- Hey, Ralph.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.834
Any progress
on that Dearbon lead?

13:11.878 --> 13:15.838
You know, I really think that
there might be something...

13:15.882 --> 13:17.187
to it.

13:17.231 --> 13:20.147
-  No.
I decided to give it up.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.062
- What?
Why?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.890
- There's no point, Iris.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.543
The whole Sue thing
is a lost cause,

13:25.587 --> 13:27.850
so I might as well quit
before I waste any more time.

13:27.894 --> 13:28.982
- Ralph, you can't quit.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.026
You're obsessed
with finding her.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.202
You have to keep going.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.117
- Iris,
despite Team Flash's mantra,

13:34.161 --> 13:37.033
sometimes you do have
to give up on things.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.513
You know, if I were you,
I would be spending

13:38.556 --> 13:40.863
a lot more time
with my husband...

13:40.907 --> 13:42.909
while he's still here.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.009
- All right.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.402
Let the search begin.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.839
- Oh, man.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.102
Without super-speed,
this is gonna take a minute.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.668
- We don't have
to search every location,

14:03.712 --> 14:04.887
just the cold ones, okay?

14:04.931 --> 14:07.063
Because the serum
we're looking for,

14:07.107 --> 14:09.849
it requires an environment
of -15 degrees.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.807
- This says -15 degrees.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.029
- Well, there you go.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.205
- Okay.
- Convenient.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.902
- Time to steal
our golden idol.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.035
Z♪

14:24.385 --> 14:26.169
Did you guys hear that?

14:26.213 --> 14:27.214
- What?
No.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.085
- I didn't hear anything.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.002
- Wait, yeah, I did hear that.
Is that an alarm?

14:33.046 --> 14:35.570
- It better not be.
I need more time to hack this.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.050
- I'm on it.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.094
- Hey.
- Yeah, yeah, I got.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.053
- I'm gonna follow him.

14:40.096 --> 14:43.099
Nash, Nash.
Nash.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.755
Okay.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.858
I don't know
where he went.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.946
- I got it.
- Yeah?

15:03.990 --> 15:06.296
- Yeah.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.819
- No.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.996
- We're too late.
- No, this can't be happening.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.128
- McCulloch must've
already sold it.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.957
- We needed this
to save Ramsey.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.959
- Boys...

15:17.003 --> 15:18.091
we got company.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.875
Always wanted to say that.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.659
Here.
Catch.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.010
- What is this?

15:24.053 --> 15:25.141
- This...

15:25.185 --> 15:26.273
this is our way out of here.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.665
- What are you talking about?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.189
What are we
supposed to do with this?

15:29.232 --> 15:30.712
- It's easy.
You just throw it.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.322
Like, now.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.020
- Whoo!

15:34.063 --> 15:37.458
Well, that was exciting,
wasn't it, fellas?

15:37.501 --> 15:39.677
- The Lounge?
How did we--

15:39.721 --> 15:41.201
- Worry less about
how we got to the Lounge,

15:41.244 --> 15:45.118
and more about building
my crypto-circuit.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.207
- That's not happening anymore.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.208
Let me correct you,
Barry Allen.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.209
Yes, it is.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.427
We had a deal, right?

15:50.471 --> 15:51.994
I would lead you
to something priceless,

15:52.038 --> 15:54.301
which I did, not my fault
the serum was gone.

15:54.344 --> 15:57.173
So now, you two...

15:57.217 --> 15:59.045
are gonna build me a device.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.744
- I don't understand.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.137
Why won't this blood
work again?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.493
What am I missing?

16:13.581 --> 16:15.496
I found it,
the cure for you.

16:15.539 --> 16:18.716
- The bonding agent
in this cure is dark matter.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.022
- So that's it.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.111
You're just deciding
to give up and die.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.157
- No one lives forever.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.593
- No.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.725
I won't give up.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.553
That's your choice.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.295
- Ramsey.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.167
I'm not your enemy.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.082
- I know.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.040
The real enemy...

16:38.084 --> 16:39.955
is death.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.180
- You know,
Nash isn't going anywhere

16:47.223 --> 16:49.051
until he gets
this crypto-circuit.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.096
How's it coming?

16:50.139 --> 16:51.880
- Almost finished.

16:51.923 --> 16:52.968
- All right.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.841
I don't know if you should.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.234
- Okay, what do you mean?

16:58.278 --> 17:01.063
- I mean,
doesn't something feel off

17:01.107 --> 17:03.065
about all this?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.284
- Yeah, I know.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.242
The guys shows up
needing our tech,

17:06.286 --> 17:07.939
makes a bargain to help us,

17:07.983 --> 17:10.899
and conveniently,
the thing we need isn't there.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.206
- Right.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.251
So, I mean...

17:15.295 --> 17:17.514
you think he's lying to us?

17:17.558 --> 17:20.300
- It wouldn't be the first time
a Wells had a secret agenda.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.041
Yeah.

17:27.350 --> 17:30.223
Yo, what's in here?

17:30.266 --> 17:33.226
- That's storage
for Frost's stuff.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.316
You know how she gets.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.933
- You haven't looked me in
the eye since I came in here.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.333
- Wait.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.213
- What the hell
am I looking at?

18:07.608 --> 18:08.652
Cisco.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.489
- You know exactly
what this is.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.013
I don't care
what powers you have.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.364
You want it...

18:24.407 --> 18:27.193
you're gonna have
to go through me.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.026
- What are you talking about?

18:35.070 --> 18:37.159
What the hell are you doing?

18:37.203 --> 18:39.335
- I'm saving your life.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.858
'Cause someone has to do it.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.209
- Saving Ramsey...

18:43.252 --> 18:44.210
saving Ramsey's my call.

18:44.253 --> 18:45.341
- And it's a bad call.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.213
- But it's the one I made.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.606
Sometimes, as a leader,
you have to make tough calls

18:49.650 --> 18:50.868
in order to serve
the greater good.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.957
- You know,
I made a tough call.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.176
And I made it for you.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.612
- But I told you.
You can't save me.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.136
- I'm not buying that.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.441
- Well, you have to.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.704
Sacrificing myself
saves everything and everyone.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.053
I've seen it.

19:02.097 --> 19:05.013
- And what does that give me
to look forward to?

19:05.056 --> 19:07.450
Waking up to a world
without the Flash?

19:07.494 --> 19:08.843
A life without my best friend?

19:08.886 --> 19:09.931
- You get to live.

19:11.933 --> 19:12.977
You all get to live.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.371
- Don't.

19:21.421 --> 19:24.206
Look, man, I...

19:24.250 --> 19:27.078
I've been dealing
with this for weeks.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.385
Wondering what's gonna happen
when I'm gone,

19:29.429 --> 19:31.431
how everybody's gonna move on.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.215
That's why I wanted us,
you and me together,

19:33.259 --> 19:35.391
to save Ramsey today.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.701
- You wanted us
to save a random person

19:40.744 --> 19:42.311
so I'd be okay with you dying?

19:42.355 --> 19:43.791
- No.

19:43.834 --> 19:47.273
I wanted us
to save one person's life

19:47.316 --> 19:50.928
so you could understand
the tough calls...

19:50.972 --> 19:53.975
the sacrifices
that a leader has to make.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.719
Because you're my pick.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.940
You're the person that
I want to run S.T.A.R. Labs

20:02.984 --> 20:06.379
and this team
when I'm gone.

20:06.422 --> 20:07.641
All day,
I've been trying to teach you

20:07.684 --> 20:10.644
how hard those responsibilities
can be.

20:12.385 --> 20:13.995
And then you stole something

20:14.038 --> 20:17.346
that was meant to save
another person's life.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.522
You justified it, even.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.831
- And I'd do it again.

20:30.751 --> 20:33.014
- Maybe I made
the wrong choice.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.261
- The serum's yours.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.449
- Barry.

21:16.492 --> 21:17.798
- Can we talk?

21:17.841 --> 21:19.887
- Um, now's really
not a good time.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.845
- It's important.

21:25.022 --> 21:28.330
I have something
that I need to give you.

21:28.374 --> 21:31.028
S.T.A.R. Labs
has been doing some research

21:31.072 --> 21:35.119
into regenerative formulas,
and we've developed a serum.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.471
We think that
this could save your life.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.213
If you inject it
into your healthy cells,

21:42.257 --> 21:44.128
they'll duplicate
and eventually overtake

21:44.172 --> 21:45.521
your cells
that are affected by HLH,

21:45.565 --> 21:47.828
but you have to use it quickly.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.438
- Is it...

21:49.482 --> 21:50.613
is it dark-matter-based?

21:50.657 --> 21:53.834
- No, it's experimental, but...

21:53.877 --> 21:55.923
we believe it'll cure you.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.364
- I'd given up hope.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.716
- But why--why do this for me?

22:08.370 --> 22:10.285
- A week ago,
you told me you felt like

22:10.329 --> 22:12.548
you were falling off a cliff.

22:12.592 --> 22:13.680
I want you to have a lifeline.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.551
- You're dying, as well.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.423
Don't you want
a lifeline for yourself?

22:17.466 --> 22:20.121
- There's only enough of this
for one person.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.645
And I've read about you,
Ramsey,

22:22.689 --> 22:24.255
and I've talked to Caitlin.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.301
You're a brilliant doctor.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.781
From what she said,
if you had enough time,

22:27.824 --> 22:30.740
you could cure HLH.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.612
I'm giving you that time.

22:32.655 --> 22:35.484
The world needs people like you

22:35.528 --> 22:38.531
to save those
who can't save themselves.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.577
Test it.

22:41.621 --> 22:44.188
Verify what we believe
it'll do,

22:44.232 --> 22:45.973
and then use it quickly.

22:46.016 --> 22:49.106
We're not sure how long
the serum will be viable.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.369
- Barry.

22:53.502 --> 22:54.677
Thank you.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.036
- Hey.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.517
You busy?

23:08.561 --> 23:10.258
- For you, Cap?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.477
Never.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.307
- Iris tells me
you've been having trouble

23:16.351 --> 23:18.484
with the Dearbon case.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.311
- Joe, I've been working
on this Dearbon thing

23:20.355 --> 23:22.226
since last summer.

23:23.576 --> 23:26.013
Then it dawned on me.

23:26.883 --> 23:30.539
Digging into this right now,
it doesn't matter.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.672
Why the hell
should I try to find her

23:32.715 --> 23:34.804
and try to help her...

23:36.284 --> 23:38.765
If I can't even save...

23:38.808 --> 23:41.463
- Barry.
You can say it.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.682
- Barry.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.120
- Ralph.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.905
Do you remember
my old partner Chyre?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.169
He taught me
an important lesson.

23:52.213 --> 23:57.218
He said, "You can't always
save everyone..."

23:58.698 --> 24:02.702
"But you can always
save someone."

24:04.225 --> 24:05.748
For you...

24:05.792 --> 24:08.142
that's Sue Dearbon...

24:08.185 --> 24:09.535
not Barry.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.066
- I'm gonna miss him, Joe.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.561
- That's it?

24:35.604 --> 24:37.127
Fully functioning
crypto-circuit?

24:37.171 --> 24:39.695
You sure?
'Cause it kind of seems like...

24:39.739 --> 24:41.523
seems kind of shoddy.
Shoddy workmanship.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.830
I feel like I've seen
better workmanship on,

24:43.873 --> 24:46.397
well, pretty much all
the other Earths out there.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.617
This is subpar.

24:48.661 --> 24:49.749
Subpar's being generous.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.098
It--never touch me.

24:53.187 --> 24:55.145
- Just take it.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.628
- Sure, kid.

24:59.672 --> 25:02.326
Thanks.
Till our next adventure.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.633
Frosty.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.862
- So...

25:15.905 --> 25:17.994
how'd it go
with Professor Speedster?

25:19.343 --> 25:22.738
You all ready
for life post-Crisis?

25:24.305 --> 25:26.220
- I think our friendship
pretty much exploded.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.700
- Ugh.

25:27.743 --> 25:32.008
- Because it impossible
to save him,

25:32.052 --> 25:36.186
and yet, I still don't
think I should stop trying.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.103
- You want some free advice?

25:41.322 --> 25:42.671
- Sure.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.806
- You can't save someone
who doesn't want to be saved.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.459
And he's already
made up his mind.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.725
And if you obsess over it,

25:52.768 --> 25:55.989
it could lead you down
a dark path.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.513
You might make
a mistake you can't fix.

25:59.775 --> 26:02.299
- Commencing preliminary tests

26:02.343 --> 26:04.345
on S.T.A.R. Lab's
proposed cure.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.106
Damn it!

26:26.149 --> 26:28.282
Of course it's another failure.

26:28.325 --> 26:32.286
Why would I expect anything
different from the universe?

26:33.809 --> 26:35.855
My fate is sealed.

26:35.898 --> 26:38.509
Death wins again.

26:41.643 --> 26:42.644
Death.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.386
There is one key difference.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.735
- Too late.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.911
- Between the blood I stole,

26:48.955 --> 26:52.001
and the blood
from Mitch Romero's body.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.960
Romero was afraid
for his life.

26:54.003 --> 26:58.355
His blood cells were flooded
with epinephrine.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.662
Adrenaline released
during the attack,

27:00.706 --> 27:01.881
it's the bonding agent,

27:01.924 --> 27:04.666
which means...

27:06.929 --> 27:09.758
In order to create
the substance I need to live,

27:09.802 --> 27:12.065
I have to kill.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.678
But first...

27:16.722 --> 27:19.681
they have to be afraid.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.837
- Multiple alarms
at Central City General.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.100
They're evacuating.
- Is it a bomb threat?

27:47.143 --> 27:50.190
- Reports say a madman
is attacking patients.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.284
All the staff and patients
are accounted for,

27:57.327 --> 27:59.416
except for those
on this floor.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.550
Ugh.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.683
That one's fresh.
Whoever did this was just here.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.423
- Why would someone do this?

28:06.467 --> 28:08.643
- She's gone.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.905
Maybe I can figure out why.

28:11.472 --> 28:12.560
- Go.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.974
- Ramsey?
What the hell are you doing?

28:35.017 --> 28:36.715
- Whatever it takes
to stay alive.

28:38.151 --> 28:41.067
- These people.
You're the one that's killing.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.633
S.T.A.R. Labs
gave you a cure.

28:42.677 --> 28:43.634
Why didn't you take it?

28:43.678 --> 28:44.766
- I did.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.681
But it didn't work.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.205
Turns out the disease in my
human blood was too far gone.

28:49.249 --> 28:52.556
But if I was to become
something more than human,

28:52.600 --> 28:54.515
that's when I realized
I could live forever.

28:54.558 --> 28:55.951
As long as I feed.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.823
- Ramsey, you're a doctor.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.999
You're supposed to save lives,
not take them.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.479
- I am saving lives, Flash.
Mine.

29:02.523 --> 29:06.832
And right now,
you are in my way.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.775
- Ramsey, come on, let him go.
Please.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.472
- I can't.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.257
My blood brothers and sisters
are much more

30:24.300 --> 30:25.824
than just the help.

30:25.867 --> 30:26.868
They're making me stronger.

30:26.912 --> 30:27.869
- You're using them.

30:27.913 --> 30:28.870
- To survive.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.922
Hello, Cait.

30:36.965 --> 30:37.879
Playing the hero now, are you?

30:37.923 --> 30:40.447
- The bad guy was taken,
so yeah.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.333
- Please, help me.

30:57.377 --> 30:58.682
- I know what you're thinking.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.902
You're fast, Flash.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.904
But as a doctor,
I know exactly where

31:02.948 --> 31:04.906
this man's carotid artery is.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.255
Even if I can't feed,

31:06.299 --> 31:08.040
you will never
save him in time.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.955
- Ramsey, don't do this.

31:09.998 --> 31:11.217
Let us help you.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.871
What you're doing, it's...

31:12.914 --> 31:14.133
inhuman.

31:14.176 --> 31:17.353
- It was my humanity
that was holding me back.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.355
Preventing me
from becoming the man

31:19.399 --> 31:22.750
Mum always knew
I was destined to be.

31:22.793 --> 31:26.101
She always said that
I would do beautiful things

31:26.145 --> 31:27.842
for this world.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.540
And she was right.

31:30.584 --> 31:34.457
Because the man I was,
that was the disease.

31:34.501 --> 31:37.983
A frail human body
with a shelf life.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.854
Rot.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.726
But I found a way
to transcend all that.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.641
To defeat death itself.

31:44.685 --> 31:45.947
- Everyone dies, Ramsey.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.210
Maybe the only thing
that makes it bearable

31:48.254 --> 31:50.734
is to find some meaning in it.

31:51.518 --> 31:54.173
- Well, that means I'm making
the greatest sacrifice of all.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.826
Don't you see?

31:55.870 --> 31:58.003
What I'm becoming,
this is the cure.

31:58.046 --> 32:02.964
I am the answer, Flash,
to the greatest mystery of all.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.661
Life eternal.

32:04.705 --> 32:05.967
- Please, Dr. Rosso.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.317
- I saved you for last

32:08.361 --> 32:09.492
so you would be
the most afraid.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.277
- Ramsey, please don't do this.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.714
- You could've saved Mum,
but you didn't.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.977
And that's why
I came here for you.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.022
- Ramsey.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.122
- Stay with me, all right?
I got you, I got you.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.742
- What the hell are they doing?

32:41.785 --> 32:43.352
- I think they're trying
to follow Ramsey.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.145
- Wait.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.278
- We have to help him.
- I don't think we can.

33:20.302 --> 33:21.347
- We lost.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.916
Five people aren't going home
to their families tonight.

33:27.309 --> 33:28.919
And the sixth, Ramsey.

33:28.963 --> 33:31.705
Lost him, too.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.533
He's out there somewhere.
We have to stop him.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.230
I...

33:35.274 --> 33:36.188
I have to stop him.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.451
- Barry.
- You tried to save him.

33:38.494 --> 33:41.758
- But he turned himself
into a monster.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.283
- That's not on us.
That was Ramsey's choice.

33:44.326 --> 33:48.635
- I swear,
if it is the last thing I do

33:48.678 --> 33:50.463
on this Earth...

33:50.506 --> 33:52.204
I'm gonna stop him.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.249
- How did Ramsey do this,
anyway?

33:54.293 --> 33:57.078
- He's using people
as incubators.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.602
Using their bodies to create

33:59.646 --> 34:01.343
what he needs
to keep himself a live.

34:01.387 --> 34:04.172
- So he's turning people
into human blood banks.

34:04.216 --> 34:06.000
- And as soon
as he gets hungry again--

34:06.044 --> 34:08.307
- He's gonna make a withdrawal.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.224
- Well, happy Halloween,
everyone.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.749
Yeah.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.283
- Hey, Ralph.

34:29.589 --> 34:32.113
Look...

34:32.157 --> 34:34.333
I know this Crisis news
hasn't been easy on anyone.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.204
- Yeah.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.553
I'll say.

34:39.207 --> 34:41.818
But look, Iris...

34:41.862 --> 34:45.953
that's no excuse
for me being a jerk.

34:46.823 --> 34:48.303
I'm sorry.

34:48.347 --> 34:51.741
I know that you were
just trying to help me.

34:51.785 --> 34:55.136
So I did want to say that
tomorrow I'm call Midway City,

34:55.180 --> 34:56.311
see what I can find.

34:56.355 --> 34:59.009
- That's great, Ralph.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.359
Sue is very lucky to have

35:00.402 --> 35:02.404
a master detective
like you searching for her.

35:02.448 --> 35:03.666
- Give me a break.

35:03.710 --> 35:06.104
It's just
a missing persons case.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.106
It's not like
I'm looking to get married.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.285
- He gonna be okay?

35:14.242 --> 35:16.549
- Yeah, he is.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.160
- Of all the nights for this
madness to be happening,

35:19.204 --> 35:20.814
it had to be Halloween.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.644
Babe,
we should probably head home.

35:24.687 --> 35:27.342
- Would you mind if I catch up
with you in a couple minutes?

35:30.258 --> 35:32.217
- No.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.305
It's fine.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.093
Barry.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.060
- Hey.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.939
- I'm sorry about
what happened at McCulloch.

35:58.982 --> 36:02.377
- No, man, no.
Look, this...

36:02.421 --> 36:04.292
this is not your fault.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.599
- I should've been focused
on saving the right person.

36:06.642 --> 36:09.776
- Well, I mean,
even though things didn't...

36:09.819 --> 36:12.561
work out with Ramsey,
at least we tried...

36:12.605 --> 36:14.737
to do the right thing.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.438
- I still don't know
how you do that, man.

36:19.481 --> 36:22.397
-Picking yourself up,
pushing forward.

36:22.441 --> 36:25.966
- I'm just trying to...

36:26.009 --> 36:29.056
teach you what it's taken me
years to learn.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.407
- I know you're doing it
for all of us.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.718
That's what it means
to be a hero.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.592
- I knew I picked
the right guy.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.161
I'm gonna...

36:47.205 --> 36:49.250
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.217
- Hey, Joe.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.090
You all right?
- Mm.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.309
I was just...

37:04.352 --> 37:08.574
just wondering
where Ramsey was and...

37:08.617 --> 37:12.273
just hoping to God
that we find him before...

37:12.317 --> 37:13.622
this gets worse.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.495
- Well, his description
has been circulated

37:16.538 --> 37:18.018
to every precinct
from here to Gotham,

37:18.061 --> 37:21.326
so we should find him.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.328
- Then what?

37:23.371 --> 37:25.721
More people are gonna get hurt.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.984
Or worse.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.072
- I know.

37:30.509 --> 37:31.988
I tried to save him.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.644
Tried to do some good
before I...

37:37.559 --> 37:40.301
- Don't you dare
start talking like that.

37:40.345 --> 37:43.478
You've done plenty of good.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.611
Ever since you became
the Flash,

37:45.654 --> 37:50.703
you've saved more people
than CCPD altogether.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.836
Without you,
I would've...

37:55.273 --> 37:58.276
I would've lost our family
a long time ago.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.192
And this is what you get
for saving the world

38:02.236 --> 38:04.412
over and over again?

38:04.456 --> 38:06.022
How...

38:06.066 --> 38:07.937
how is that right?

38:09.112 --> 38:10.462
- You know it doesn't work
like that.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.246
- Doesn't it?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.421
I mean, I'm a cop.

38:13.465 --> 38:15.771
If I risk my life
every day for 30 years,

38:15.815 --> 38:17.120
I get to retire, Barr.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.905
I get to go home
to the woman I love.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.603
I get to proudly watch
my baby girl

38:21.647 --> 38:23.431
grow up each and every day.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.477
I get a life, Barr.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.306
You're a hero.
What do you get?

38:28.349 --> 38:30.482
Nothing?

38:34.486 --> 38:36.488
It's just...

38:36.531 --> 38:38.620
Damn it.
It's not right.

38:40.492 --> 38:43.408
We--the world...

38:43.451 --> 38:45.410
the world owes you.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.542
You deserve better than this.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.502
- No, I don't.

38:52.721 --> 38:56.769
I'm grateful
for everything that I have.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.643
All the blessings in my life.

39:01.687 --> 39:04.516
For Iris, the team.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.084
I mean, hell...

39:08.128 --> 39:10.217
I'm the Flash.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.089
I'm grateful for that.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.445
But you...

39:23.665 --> 39:26.886
You're what
I'm most grateful for.

39:28.801 --> 39:31.499
If it weren't for you...

39:31.543 --> 39:34.284
your patience, your courage...

39:35.460 --> 39:38.463
The will just to keep going.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.727
I learned all that from you.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.426
More than anyone else,
before the team,

39:45.470 --> 39:47.994
before Iris...

39:48.037 --> 39:51.214
you were the one
that showed me

39:51.258 --> 39:53.478
what it takes just to...

39:53.521 --> 39:55.828
be a good person.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.135
You're one
of the biggest reasons

39:59.179 --> 40:02.574
I was even able
to become the Flash.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.271
For that,
I'll always be grateful.

40:10.669 --> 40:13.323
Barr, I'm not ready.

40:13.367 --> 40:16.326
I'm not ready for this.

40:16.370 --> 40:17.676
It's not...

40:17.719 --> 40:19.504
- It's okay, man.
It's all right.

40:19.547 --> 40:22.724
- No.
I know you...

40:22.768 --> 40:25.814
I know you say
it has to happen, but...

40:27.555 --> 40:29.992
- It's all right.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.994
It's okay.

40:35.607 --> 40:38.348
I'm never gonna leave you.

40:38.392 --> 40:40.350
Even when I'm gone.

41:00.545 --> 41:01.937
Let's try this.

41:29.225 --> 41:31.663
So this is where
you've been hiding.

41:51.944 --> 41:53.380
Time to pay a house call.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.321
- Greg, move your head.
