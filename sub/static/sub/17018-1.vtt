<i>You must get this amount or
it will be serious.Your Father</i>

02:15.907 --> 02:19.553
"First call for lunch 
in the dining car"!

02:38.965 --> 02:44.025
<i>Your handkerchiefs are 
under your shirts.</i>

02:44.060 --> 02:47.395
<i>Use a clean one every day.</i>

02:47.430 --> 02:50.603
<i>Don't stay out late at night</i>

02:50.638 --> 02:56.992
<i>Don't take up with strangers.
Remember we are depending on you
to do your best.</i>

03:01.770 --> 03:04.949
Was that the first call for luncheon?

03:10.407 --> 03:14.011
Guess so. It's the first one 
I've heard, ma'am.

04:03.639 --> 04:06.553
Maybe I made a mistake...

04:06.588 --> 04:09.230
...sendin' Lem to Chicago...alone.

05:20.310 --> 05:25.201
I raise wheat to sell, not to 
play with! Every grain counts!

06:25.556 --> 06:28.488
Give us this day
our daily bread....

07:56.645 --> 08:01.641
Get to work, Kate... that fan's
for the files!

08:09.605 --> 08:15.919
If the files are as hot as 
I am, they need it!

08:28.468 --> 08:31.048
Can you beat it ?
He's praying !

08:33.086 --> 08:37.423
Betcha two bits he's gonna 
take a chance on the hash !

09:05.045 --> 09:08.836
I'd like some corned beef hash
and coffee, please.

09:12.434 --> 09:14.115
You win!

09:52.945 --> 09:54.182
Gee! I'm sorry!

09:56.908 --> 10:00.693
It was my fault...for
putting 'em there.

10:08.602 --> 10:11.147
Mother.

10:19.816 --> 10:21.028
Minnesota, eh?

10:24.994 --> 10:26.269
Swede ?

10:28.833 --> 10:31.671
No.. pa is Scotch
Ma is Canadian...

10:31.706 --> 10:34.489
...and I'm plain American.

10:38.856 --> 10:41.806
Lonesome in the big city, aint it ?

10:41.831 --> 10:44.626
What you doin' here?

10:48.864 --> 10:53.329
I'm down here to sell 
our wheat crop.

11:02.608 --> 11:08.389
Well, old wheat king, how about
some bread pudding for desert?

11:57.509 --> 12:01.714
I always do that at home.
It makesMa's work easier.

12:14.245 --> 12:17.536
Living on a farm 
must be wonderful!

13:19.884 --> 13:23.037
I'm certainly glad to have met you!

13:24.699 --> 13:26.051
I'm glad too.

13:52.382 --> 13:55.318
CROP ESTIMATE PUTS CORN PRICE UP,
WHEAT DOWN.

16:40.329 --> 16:44.880
No letter from Lem yet.
I'm worried, Mother.

16:48.093 --> 16:56.441
Lem's doin' what's right...You keep
forgettin' our boy's a grown man now.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.978
maybe you're right,...

17:05.012 --> 17:10.454
...but I can't help thinkin'
of him as a little shaver.

17:17.944 --> 17:24.592
Just the same, if he don't sell right,
I'll never be able to make both ends meet!

18:58.777 --> 19:02.345
Hey! How does he rate a private breeze?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.770
How old is this fish anyway ?

19:30.069 --> 19:33.614
Don't ask me Mister!
Look in his mouth!

19:48.533 --> 19:55.066
Figurin' how much it'll cost to
take her out tonight, Buddy?

20:21.840 --> 20:27.313
I sold the wheat today...
I hope Pop won't be mad.

20:32.057 --> 20:36.513
He sent you to sell it, didn't he?

20:40.250 --> 20:44.415
But i didn't get his price.

20:44.440 --> 20:50.460
It was droppin' so fast I was
afraid to hold out any longer.

21:27.243 --> 21:31.042
I'd rather be deaf than blind,
wouldn't you ?

21:48.533 --> 21:56.905
I can see you'd be nice company.
What do you do with your evenings?

21:58.570 --> 22:00.695
You'll never know!

22:24.042 --> 22:27.863
You shouldn't 'a done that!
Fighting over me!

22:31.105 --> 22:37.013
I'd fight anybody who tried
to lay a hand on you!

22:47.634 --> 22:51.606
I'm going home....
on the one o'clock train.

22:57.279 --> 23:04.289
Cut short the side order, Kate...
the boss is givin' you the eagle eye!

23:20.321 --> 23:23.598
There's something I wanted to ask..

23:35.330 --> 23:39.095
I wanted to ask...If you...

23:41.504 --> 23:43.061
If you... like...

23:44.883 --> 23:47.485
...like.. like living in the city?

23:56.872 --> 24:00.326
Guess one place is good as another.

24:00.361 --> 24:03.326
It's all a wash-out,
 If you ask me!!

24:17.867 --> 24:23.042
Well s'long Kid! Give my love
to the cows and the chickens!

25:47.001 --> 25:49.836
I think... I'll wait a minute.

26:13.976 --> 26:16.478
YOUR WEIGHT and 
YOUR FORTUNE.

26:44.242 --> 26:47.654
If you marry the one you are 
thinking of all will be well.

27:23.342 --> 27:27.343
I left something behind...
got to get it.

29:49.177 --> 29:54.281
If we get married right away
we can be home by morning.

30:49.665 --> 30:55.015
<i>Just married a sweet girl
waitress in big resyaurant</i>

30:55.050 --> 31:00.706
<i>Know you will love her. Bringing
her home tomorrow. </i>

31:04.298 --> 31:05.768
Your Son

31:35.410 --> 31:38.424
Good girls ain't that free and easy 
about getting married.

31:38.559 --> 31:41.013
The boy's been roped in!

32:59.111 --> 33:03.456
Oh, Lem, it's wonderful to have a home
and a mother and father...

33:05.482 --> 33:08.019
And a man of my own...

33:08.126 --> 33:12.590
...a real two-fisted guy...
to take care of me!

36:05.809 --> 36:07.621
Ma ...this is Kate!

36:41.159 --> 36:45.066
This is the prettiest bridal bouquet
I ever saw!

36:45.101 --> 36:47.074
You're Marie, ain't you?

38:12.300 --> 38:16.908
If I catch you playin' with wheat
again, I'll whip you!

38:45.333 --> 38:46.886
Father... here's Kate.

38:54.683 --> 38:58.409
How much did you get 
for the wheat?

39:29.129 --> 39:32.577
Didn't I tell you not to sell
under $1.15?

39:49.982 --> 39:55.972
If you'd been tendin' to my business
'stead of your own, you'd 'a waited.

40:11.763 --> 40:14.805
Change your clothes
and get to work!

40:14.840 --> 40:17.595
The harvesters are 
comin' in the mornin'!

40:41.582 --> 40:44.861
Don't mind Father....
he's upset.

40:44.861 --> 40:47.518
And he never can bear to be crossed.

40:57.236 --> 40:59.783
I want to talk to you!

41:31.539 --> 41:37.313
I'd like to know what you expected
to get out of marryin' Lem.

41:46.258 --> 41:49.102
What any other wife expects.

41:49.137 --> 41:52.041
I married Lem because I...
..I love him..

41:54.630 --> 41:59.020
Women like you love for
what they can get out of it...

42:05.413 --> 42:10.389
...But you'll get nothing from me!
You can go back to Chicago!

42:13.449 --> 42:18.548
You certainly smeared it that time!
Now I'll never give Lem up!...

42:22.302 --> 42:27.763
I am going to make a man of Lem Tustine
in spite of you!.....

42:30.135 --> 42:33.401
...And if you think he'll let me go away
without him...

42:33.436 --> 42:36.135
...guess again!

42:39.644 --> 42:42.819
I'm master here! 
My son does what I say...

42:42.854 --> 42:45.617
...and so will you!

43:20.617 --> 43:22.376
Your... father... hit me!

44:20.346 --> 44:23.650
Kate... I can't strike 
my own father!

45:14.824 --> 45:18.478
And this is our honeymoon!

46:02.112 --> 46:07.714
I got some surprise for you! Lem's went
an' married a city girl!

46:10.776 --> 46:12.146
Good looker?

46:41.611 --> 46:46.796
The old man's like a mad bull...
tryin' to bust it up...

46:49.038 --> 46:52.456
...An' last night, she slept 
in the bedroom alone...

46:52.491 --> 46:54.599
...'an he slept in the loft!

47:17.115 --> 47:22.935
I'm gonna have first look! Maybe 
I'll help the old man bust it up!.

47:51.600 --> 47:55.387
Well, Pa-in-law, where's the
blushin' bride?

48:32.685 --> 48:36.532
Get busy! Do somethin'
to earn your keep!

49:05.330 --> 49:08.388
How do you like bein' here?

49:10.205 --> 49:14.374
Bein' here's all right... I don't
think much of the company.

49:28.603 --> 49:33.052
Don't waste any more time...
we got to get started.

53:37.200 --> 53:40.360
Aw, she don't weigh
no 187 pounds!

54:23.320 --> 54:26.194
I don't want anything to eat.

55:52.203 --> 55:56.045
Looks like you've popped
into a hornrt's nest.

55:58.264 --> 55:59.735
You said it!

56:41.276 --> 56:45.787
There's your chance, Mac...
to check up on that weighin' machine!

57:49.566 --> 57:52.729
Kate... we can't go on like this...

58:04.451 --> 58:08.362
I didn't think anybody could 
ever come between us......

58:17.193 --> 58:20.155
Kate, Let's forget this quarrel 
and be happy.

58:20.190 --> 58:22.940
I love you... you're my wife.

59:30.920 --> 59:33.060
If you marry the one you are
thinking of all will be well.

59:51.175 --> 59:54.353
Lem! This aint the bridal suite.

59:56.149 --> 59:58.416
You mind your own business!

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:09.047
that goes for all of you! And if anyone
wants an argument, I got two good ones!

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:58.768
Hailstorm Sweeps Canada

01:01:22.962 --> 01:01:25.541
There's a hailstorm comin'! 

01:01:25.586 --> 01:01:28.557
We'll have to work all night
to save the crop!

01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:40.152
Divide the men in two shifts, Mac...
double pay for overtime!

01:01:40.187 --> 01:01:42.224
...double pay for overtime!

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:44.988
HAILSTORM SWEEPS CENTRAL CANADÁ 

01:02:44.023 --> 01:02:48.121
WHEAT CROP RUINED

01:03:28.696 --> 01:03:31.550
I cut my hand on the machine.

01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:24.705
Say, are you crazy?

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.998
A girl like you buryin'
yourself in a dump like this!

01:04:34.168 --> 01:04:36.714
What's the matter with you hicks?

01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:40.025
Don't people ever 
fall in love out here?

01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:55.692
You didn't look exactly lovin' 
when you ran...

01:04:55.727 --> 01:04:58.343
...out of that room tonight.

01:05:09.003 --> 01:05:12.291
Why don't you chuck all this...

01:05:12.346 --> 01:05:15.879
come away with me when we 
finish the harvestin'...

01:05:43.103 --> 01:05:45.641
I'll treat you right... 
and that's more than...

01:05:45.696 --> 01:05:48.514
...old Tustine will ever let Lem do!

01:06:04.341 --> 01:06:07.960
I always knew you 
wasn't a good woman!

01:06:18.677 --> 01:06:24.705
I'm goin' to find Lem now...and
tell him what kind of wife he's got

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:43.186
What's the use of talkin' 
to that old devil?

01:06:56.155 --> 01:07:00.027
I know how to get even with him...

01:07:11.812 --> 01:07:14.978
The storm'll be here in no time...

01:07:26.212 --> 01:07:29.012
I used to think the country was clean,...

01:07:29.057 --> 01:07:31.936
...that men out here were decent...

01:07:37.786 --> 01:07:41.361
But you're all alike...cheap sports!

01:07:41.396 --> 01:07:46.134
You all talk big 
when you want something!!

01:08:03.111 --> 01:08:08.669
If that's the way you feel about it,
I'll give you somethin' more'n talk!

01:08:11.426 --> 01:08:15.394
I don't want anything from you!
I can fight for myself!

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:35.938
You agreed to work all night!

01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:43.737
We've changed our minds.
We're quittin' now!

01:09:23.057 --> 01:09:28.506
My father says he caught you and Mac
planning to run away together.

01:09:44.942 --> 01:09:48.238
Haven't you anything to say?

01:09:52.801 --> 01:09:56.547
Not a  thing... you can 
believe it or not!

01:09:59.314 --> 01:10:01.886
If I thought it was true...

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:08.587
Yeah? What would you do? 
Run to Papa?

01:10:11.264 --> 01:10:16.429
I'd smash Mac so's he'd never come
hanging around my wife again!!

01:10:18.311 --> 01:10:23.732
You got to learn any
man can get a wife!!

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:31.321
But it takes more'n a license 
and a wedding ring to hold her!

01:10:39.676 --> 01:10:42.885
I guess our marriage was a mistake.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:07.201
I'll shoot the first man
that leaves my farm!

01:11:54.857 --> 01:11:59.855
Listen to me Kate. I've settled 
your score with the old man!

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:06.820
I've called the men out...

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:09.933
and we're leavin'the wheat 
to rot in the fields.

01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:30.076
I'm leavin' with the men in ten minutes
and you're comin' with me...

01:12:33.802 --> 01:12:38.279
..If you don't I'll say you 
put me up to ruinin' the wheat!

01:12:38.324 --> 01:12:40.149
Are you comin'?

01:12:43.341 --> 01:12:47.737
Yes...yes ..but I've got to
have time to pack.

01:13:51.876 --> 01:13:53.812
Here's somethin' Mac forgot!

01:14:18.967 --> 01:14:22.480
We're waitin' for Kate
...she's comin' with me!

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:05.893
<i>I thought I could help 
you by staying,...</i>

01:15:06.928 --> 01:15:13.933
<i>...then you believed 
that lie about me and Mac.</i>

01:15:16.009 --> 01:15:23.684
<i>Mac tried to get me to go with him
but I wouldn't. Maybe with me gone, 
They'll work and save the wheat</i>

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:31.397
<i>I never loved anybody but you,
Goodbye, Kate.</i>

01:17:03.497 --> 01:17:04.735
Father... it's Lem!

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:07.852
FATHER!

01:17:53.285 --> 01:17:57.690
Son, you know I...I wasn't 
meanin' to shoot you.

01:18:00.871 --> 01:18:04.602
There's some things worse'n shooting.
One of 'ems the hell..

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:07.828
...you been putting 
Kate and me through.

01:18:13.559 --> 01:18:17.065
...Now I'm going to find Kate...

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.593
...and take her away...
where we can live our own lives.

01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:36.505
I been wrong, Lem,
and I'm sorry...

01:18:39.516 --> 01:18:44.757
...Don't leave us! Let me find
Kate and beg her to stay.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.519
No...I got to find her myself.

01:19:12.776 --> 01:19:16.003
I won't try to stop 
you again, boys.

01:19:16.048 --> 01:19:18.544
You can go whenever you want to.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.273
We ain't goin' to leave 
till your wheat's in!

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.662
You're on the wrong road.

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:37.990
There's only more farms 
like ours that way...

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:45.414
...That's the road to the station.

01:20:56.862 --> 01:21:00.044
Let me give you a lift, Kate.

01:22:15.065 --> 01:22:19.476
Remember when we first 
came along this road...

01:22:19.521 --> 01:22:22.261
...how happy we were?

01:22:35.395 --> 01:22:39.157
When I got your note
Kate, I went crazy...

01:23:36.523 --> 01:23:37.809
Father, here's Kate.

01:23:44.363 --> 01:23:46.717
Can you forgive me... Kate?

01:23:49.721 --> 01:23:53.450
