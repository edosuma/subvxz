WEBVTT

00:45.879 --> 00:48.841
And thank you to my amazing bridesmaids
for making it out here

00:48.924 --> 00:52.010
to Alliance, Nebraska,
for our destination wedding.

00:52.803 --> 00:56.849
And finally, I'd like to raise a glass
to my Grandpa and Grandma Froimson

00:56.932 --> 00:59.518
for showing me
what true love should look like.

00:59.601 --> 01:03.397
Fifty years ago they went on a walk
and walked straight to the courthouse.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.940
They just knew.

01:05.022 --> 01:07.985
My grandpa called it
the "Froimson Feeling."

01:08.735 --> 01:12.072
And, Eddie,
I have the Froimson Feeling for you.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.741
All right, bridesmaids. Time to dance.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.498
I don't know this song.
Nicole never warned me about this.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.168
The instructions are in the song.
Just follow along.

01:24.251 --> 01:28.463
To the right, to the right
To the left, to the right

01:28.547 --> 01:29.923
To the left, to the right

01:30.007 --> 01:32.342
To the left, to the left

01:32.426 --> 01:35.137
Step forward, to the right

01:35.220 --> 01:39.892
And now, it's time
for the bridesmaids' significant others

01:39.975 --> 01:42.477
to join the ladies on the dance floor.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.563
-Okay.
-Let's bring it home.

01:44.646 --> 01:48.108
To the right, to the right
To the left, to the right

01:48.192 --> 01:51.987
To the left, to the right
To the left, to the left

01:52.070 --> 01:56.033
Step forward
To the right, to the right

01:56.116 --> 01:57.242
You're good. Doing great.

01:57.326 --> 02:00.287
Step backward
To the left, to the left

02:07.920 --> 02:09.963
Would've been nice
if we'd danced together.

02:10.047 --> 02:13.759
I know, but line dancing,
weddings, the whole...

02:13.842 --> 02:15.552
I hate it. You know how much I hate it.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.680
Yeah, but you left me
up there alone, which I hate.

02:20.807 --> 02:21.808
I'm sorry.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.312
I love you. You know I love you, right?

02:26.021 --> 02:27.397
Yeah, I do.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.861
So Nicole and Eddie are married now.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.488
Yeah. Yeah, crazy.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.324
Even though they started dating
a year after we did.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.952
Okay. What are the top three for tonight?

02:40.035 --> 02:42.746
Top three worst moments
of the evening. Go.

02:42.829 --> 02:47.751
Okay. Number one:
When Nicole's grandfather got so drunk

02:47.835 --> 02:49.711
that he started dancing with a tree.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.550
Well, you can't deny
the Froimson Feeling. You really--

02:54.633 --> 02:59.221
Number two: I-- I gotta go with when
that girl came out of the photo booth

02:59.304 --> 03:02.015
-barefoot, holding a skewer of lamb.
-Yeah.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.269
She definitely did not have that skewer
when she went in.

03:06.979 --> 03:12.609
And number three is
the DJ's choice of "Blurred Lines"

03:12.693 --> 03:14.236
for the daddy-daughter dance.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.406
The lines between daddies
and daughters are pretty clear.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.631
Damn gentlemen's punch.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.474
Good morning, sunshine.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.561
Hey! Thank you so much for last night.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.855
It was really fun. So I'll see you around?

03:49.938 --> 03:51.190
Yee honk.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.443
Where you off to so fast?
Aren't you gonna stay for breakfast?

03:54.526 --> 03:55.777
Oh, wow.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.656
This is a lot. You really went all out.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.660
Well, that's what a fellow does
when he's found the one.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.037
The what now?

04:05.787 --> 04:09.416
You done tamed me

04:09.499 --> 04:12.961
This buck no longer is free

04:13.045 --> 04:16.464
A lady doctor from New York City

04:16.548 --> 04:19.843
Smiled at me with her eyes all pretty

04:19.927 --> 04:23.013
Now I'm hooked and it's made me giddy

04:23.096 --> 04:25.891
You done tamed me

04:25.974 --> 04:28.810
So what do you say?
You ready to make an honest man out of me?

04:29.520 --> 04:32.439
Oh, Danny, no.

04:32.523 --> 04:37.319
I'm flattered, but I--
This was really more of a one-night thing.

04:37.402 --> 04:41.573
Plus, you know, Josh and I,
we just had a little lovers' spat,

04:42.199 --> 04:45.911
made some mistakes,
extremely hot mistakes.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.872
But-- Think we're gonna patch things up.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.208
So, yup.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.460
I'm gonna skedaddle on out of here.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.338
And you can go back to being
the town rapscallion.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.965
But wait!

04:58.966 --> 05:01.552
How's a broken, busted carny like me

05:01.635 --> 05:07.683
Gonna provide for my brand-new
Highfalutin, big city bride

05:07.766 --> 05:11.353
With a kid that's on the way?

05:11.937 --> 05:13.814
Whoa, okay. I'm not your bride.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.482
And no need to worry about a baby

05:15.566 --> 05:17.734
'cause I have
this magic thing called an IUD.

05:17.818 --> 05:22.573
Course if he's a boy
Everything will be fine

05:22.656 --> 05:29.621
But what if he's a girl?

05:29.705 --> 05:35.794
A dainty, delicate, pink-wearin'
Frills and curls girl?

05:35.878 --> 05:39.339
That'd change everything

05:39.423 --> 05:42.384
But would it? Really?
And, again, I'm not preg--

05:42.467 --> 05:46.346
And so from this day forward I vow

05:46.430 --> 05:51.894
I'm gonna get me some money
Someway, somehow

05:51.977 --> 05:57.191
I paid a colleague to insert
a copper, T-shaped device in my uterus

05:57.274 --> 05:58.775
to prevent the implantation of--

05:58.859 --> 06:02.404
I gotta get some money
And there's no way to make it

06:02.487 --> 06:03.488
Forget it.

06:03.572 --> 06:06.450
So I'm gonna have to steal it
Or even take it

06:06.533 --> 06:07.868
Those are the same thing.

06:07.951 --> 06:11.121
Or filch it
Or pilfer it, or rob it, or swipe it

06:11.205 --> 06:14.249
Or nick it, or thieve it

06:14.333 --> 06:16.752
Or finagle it
Or abscond with it...

06:23.675 --> 06:26.428
-Come on.
-Hey! Have any of you ladies seen Josh?

06:26.512 --> 06:29.973
Show the ring.
Show the ring. Show the ring.

06:30.057 --> 06:35.229
Show the ring. Show the ring.
Show the ring. Show the ring.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.857
Show the ring.
Show the ring. Show the ring.

06:38.941 --> 06:43.153
Ladies, I'm proud to announce
that from now on,

06:43.237 --> 06:46.365
you can call me
Mrs. Doctor Josh Skinner MD.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.620
Yee honk.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.373
Mel. Over here.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.046
You ass. You're engaged?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.714
After all the meltdowns you'd have

07:02.798 --> 07:06.510
anytime I'd very casually ask
to look at rings? Online?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.011
He was going to shoot me.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.596
What? Who?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.390
The farmer. Betsy's father.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.142
He pointed a full-on
Elmer Fudd shotgun at my face

07:14.226 --> 07:17.229
and forced me to propose to her
on the spot. I had no choice!

07:18.564 --> 07:19.565
It's not funny!

07:19.648 --> 07:21.024
It kind of is.

07:21.108 --> 07:25.904
And, by the way, that girl is apparently
much younger than she looks.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.031
Yeah, I tried to warn you.

07:28.115 --> 07:32.494
Have you not seen Sound of Music?
Liesl is 16 going on 29.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.413
And he's a doctor!

07:36.874 --> 07:39.751
Women were so underwritten
in early musicals.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.045
Wait a minute.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.508
What?

07:48.427 --> 07:49.761
Harvey, what's going on?

07:49.845 --> 07:52.055
I'm so sorry, Miss Melissa.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.017
They just came over all of a sudden
and made me clean out your rooms.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.018
Who's "they"?

07:56.101 --> 07:58.312
Well, it's...

08:00.147 --> 08:01.648
It is we.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.693
The concerned citizens of
the Mothers Against the Future.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.279
"The Mothers Against the Future"?

08:07.362 --> 08:10.032
So, you're against the passage of time?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.075
We are against city folk like you

08:12.159 --> 08:14.786
contaminating our town
with your urban ways.

08:14.870 --> 08:19.041
Exhibit A: you went off into the woods
with an innocent girl and led her astray.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.627
What? No, I didn't. Nothing even happened.

08:21.710 --> 08:25.881
And exhibit B: you spent the night
with that known fornicator Danny Bailey.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.426
And also in my situation nothing happened.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.054
Just the same thing
that happened in his situation.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.179
And you know what?

08:33.263 --> 08:37.183
We are both outraged
by these outlandish allegations.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.020
The only outrageous thing here
is your behavior,

08:40.102 --> 08:43.148
which has now officially
been deemed as unseemly

08:43.232 --> 08:44.691
by the Mothers Against the Future.

08:44.775 --> 08:49.071
Therefore, no one, and I mean no one,
in Schmigadoon will give you lodging.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.366
And, Harvey, don't even think about
letting them back in after I've left.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.825
I can read you like a book.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.036
Oh, wait, books have spines.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.165
Y'all have a nice day.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.292
Let's go, ladies.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.968
So you and the carny actually--

09:12.678 --> 09:15.347
-Why?
-Why did you do the basket auction?

09:15.430 --> 09:16.849
I--

09:16.932 --> 09:20.269
-Okay, look, we both made mistakes.
-Yeah.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.728
So let's just move on.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.522
We've got more important things
to deal with.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.440
For instance, me being shot to death.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.817
That's not gonna happen, Josh.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.778
We're in a musical, okay?
Nobody gets killed in a musical.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.531
Except Oklahoma! And Carousel.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.367
And South Pacific.
Oh, hello, West Side Story.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.619
That sounds like all the musicals.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.330
So I'm dead, we have no place to stay,
and we're stuck here forever.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.125
No, we're not.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.835
You go break things off with Betsy.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.461
The farmer's not gonna shoot you.

09:46.545 --> 09:50.257
And I will go find the mayor and see if he
can help us find another place to stay.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.675
And then what?

09:51.758 --> 09:55.137
And then--
We're smart, we found our way out of Ikea.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.181
We'll find a way out of here.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.724
Okay.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.350
Sounds good.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.435
I'm gonna do it.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.478
You'll be fine, I promise.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.487
Hey, Betsy.

10:12.571 --> 10:17.284
Hey there. And that is
Mrs. Doctor Josh Skinner to you.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.661
Oh, Betsy.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.788
So, there is something
we need to talk about.

10:21.872 --> 10:25.459
Well, no kidding.
I mean, there are so many plans to make.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.586
I just--

10:27.669 --> 10:30.047
I really can't wait to be married.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.050
Yeah, that's pretty clear.
But you know what?

10:33.133 --> 10:37.638
You are still young.
And how young, we'll probably never know.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.973
But you have your whole life ahead of you,

10:40.057 --> 10:43.143
so there's no need
to rush into things, right?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.313
But if it's true love...

10:46.396 --> 10:48.232
Well, sure. But--

10:50.734 --> 10:51.735
Wait a minute.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.654
What if it is?

10:54.696 --> 10:57.908
Who knows what
Schmigadoon thinks is true love, right?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.368
Maybe you're my way out.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.578
Your way out of what?

11:02.829 --> 11:06.625
But why are you so set on walking
across the footbridge right now?

11:06.708 --> 11:08.210
Is there some kind of romantic reason?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.378
Yes, exactly.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.922
There's a romantic reason.
A very romantic reason.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.216
What is it?

11:14.299 --> 11:16.343
-I'm gonna tell you right now.
-Okay.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.761
What the reason is.

11:18.720 --> 11:23.684
Because it's... really romantic.

11:27.813 --> 11:33.318
It's something my family calls
the "Skinner Feeling."

11:33.402 --> 11:34.570
The Skinner Feeling?

11:34.653 --> 11:37.531
Yes! So, over 50 years ago,

11:37.614 --> 11:40.909
my grandparents went for a walk
to the local footbridge.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.411
And after they crossed,

11:42.494 --> 11:45.706
they ended up walking straight
to the courthouse to get married.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.791
Grandpa said once he crossed
that bridge with Grandma,

11:47.875 --> 11:50.335
he knew, without a doubt,
it was true love.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.672
-It was the Skinner Feeling.
-That's right.

11:53.755 --> 11:57.009
And it's not to be doubted.
And only a Skinner can feel it.

11:58.468 --> 12:03.432
And the other person can never know
whether he does or doesn't.

12:03.515 --> 12:07.853
Dr. Josh Skinner, that is the
most beautiful thing that I've ever heard.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.855
Great. And so now it's tradition

12:09.938 --> 12:12.316
for a Skinner to cross a bridge
with their betrothed

12:12.399 --> 12:14.359
so they can be sure that it's true love.

12:14.443 --> 12:17.446
Well, I for one would be honored
to cross this bridge with you.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.364
-All right, sounds great. Let's do this.
-Okay.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.082
Damn it.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.587
So did you feel it?
Just like your Grandpa Skinner did?

12:34.338 --> 12:35.839
Actually, no.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.841
-I'm so sorry, Betsy.
-But--

12:38.842 --> 12:42.179
So then it's not true love?
Are we not getting married?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.765
I guess not. I'm as confused as you are.

12:45.766 --> 12:49.311
Damn this Skinner Feeling!
It's a curse is what it is.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.731
Papa's not gonna like this.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.734
Yeah, so maybe we should
hold off letting him know

12:55.817 --> 12:59.029
out of consideration
for his feelings and my life?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.906
Papa!

13:00.989 --> 13:03.075
Wait! Seriously, don't tell Papa!

13:03.992 --> 13:07.371
You'll be okay, Betsy!
There are plenty other guys out there!

13:07.454 --> 13:09.915
Maybe some closer to your own age!

13:09.998 --> 13:11.124
Whatever that is.

13:12.376 --> 13:13.544
You just have to...

13:17.714 --> 13:18.924
keep trying.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.260
So, what can I help you with, dear?

13:21.343 --> 13:23.846
I'm actually looking for the mayor.
Is he in?

13:23.929 --> 13:27.015
Sorry, no. He's on one of his walks again.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.184
He just loves going on his walks.

13:29.268 --> 13:31.353
How are you finding your rooms at the inn?

13:31.979 --> 13:35.232
I always use a long piece of string
tied to the doorknob.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.359
Actually, that's why I'm here.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.695
Turns out,
Mildred Layton got us kicked out

13:39.778 --> 13:42.531
and told everybody in town
not to put us up.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.033
So I was hoping maybe
the mayor could intervene?

13:45.117 --> 13:46.285
Oh, no.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.746
The mayor doesn't want to run afoul of
the Mothers Against the Future.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.165
I think they're witches.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.502
So, where are we supposed to stay?

13:55.586 --> 13:58.922
I'm not sure.
Would you be staying together?

13:59.673 --> 14:03.635
I think so.
It's still a little complicated.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.973
You know, I heard Doc Lopez
was looking for a new nurse.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.100
And the position comes
with room and board.

14:10.184 --> 14:14.396
I'm a little overqualified to be a nurse.
I'm actually a doctor.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.694
Well, maybe the mayor will be able to
help you once he gets back from his walk.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.071
He just loves his walks.

14:23.155 --> 14:28.410
Sometimes he's gone for hours on end
just walking and walking.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.957
Mrs. Menlove, forgive me for asking,

14:34.791 --> 14:39.087
but how much do you really know
about your husband?

14:39.922 --> 14:41.590
That's a good question.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.927
He's a hard man to know, it seems.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.012
Different.

14:47.804 --> 14:53.519
Some men like to fight and curse
They smoke and drink and yell

14:54.061 --> 14:59.608
Leave you flat, or even worse
They stay and make life hell

14:59.691 --> 15:05.614
But my man is gentle
As soft and sentimental

15:06.281 --> 15:11.203
As any lace adorned a valentine

15:11.286 --> 15:14.289
He's a queer one

15:14.373 --> 15:21.004
That man o' mine

15:21.797 --> 15:22.798
Oh, honey.

15:23.465 --> 15:28.846
Some men stumble home at dark
Want dinner and dessert

15:29.888 --> 15:35.102
Other men have eyes that spark
At every passing skirt

15:35.811 --> 15:41.525
But my man loves cookin'
I've never caught him lookin'

15:41.608 --> 15:47.030
At other gals more young
Petite, or fine

15:47.114 --> 15:50.409
He's a queer one

15:50.492 --> 15:56.498
That man o' mine

15:57.416 --> 15:59.835
This was literally me in high school.

15:59.918 --> 16:05.799
Show me any other man
More tender or expressive

16:05.883 --> 16:09.928
I only wish that nightly

16:10.012 --> 16:15.475
He were slightly more aggressive

16:15.559 --> 16:16.727
There it is.

16:16.810 --> 16:21.982
Sometimes it may seem like
He is too good to be true

16:22.649 --> 16:28.614
Like there's a man that I can't see
Just aching to break through

16:28.697 --> 16:33.994
I wish I could free him
So I could finally see him

16:34.661 --> 16:39.791
The way he truly is
And let him shine

16:39.875 --> 16:43.879
He's a queer one

16:43.962 --> 16:50.928
That man o' mine

16:56.266 --> 17:00.103
Mrs. Menlove, you could always give
your husband a little nudge

17:00.187 --> 17:02.439
to help him break out of his shell.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.191
Oh, no. I could never do that.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.276
That's for him to decide, not me.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.780
It's off! It's off!
Doctor Skinner's called it off.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.240
Carson, what's this about?

17:11.323 --> 17:12.741
Wait. Who called what off now?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.910
Also is he just allowed
to burst in everywhere?

17:14.992 --> 17:17.704
Dr. Skinner!
He's broken off the engagement.

17:17.788 --> 17:21.165
And now Betsy's devastated.
It's off! It's off!

17:23.627 --> 17:27.964
Wow. He did it. He actually did it.

17:28.632 --> 17:32.886
Maybe Josh is finally ready
to commit to working on us.

17:32.970 --> 17:36.849
And Grandpa said when he'd crossed
that bridge with Grandma,

17:36.932 --> 17:39.768
that he knew, without a doubt,
that it was true love.

17:39.852 --> 17:40.853
Oh, my.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.355
He called it the "Skinner Feeling."

17:44.898 --> 17:46.984
So which of you ladies wants
to cross this bridge with me?

17:47.067 --> 17:49.820
Let's move it along 'cause there may or
may not be a farmer who wants to kill me.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.196
I hope it's me.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.532
I didn't know about this
until ten seconds ago,

17:53.615 --> 17:55.576
but now it's my only dream.

17:56.577 --> 18:00.622
Sure, yeah! Let's make it a number!
Why the hell not?

18:00.706 --> 18:06.003
I've heard it so often
That I'm numb to it

18:06.086 --> 18:11.508
"Let's cross that bridge
When we come to it"

18:11.592 --> 18:16.847
But now that I'm single
Still at twenty-three

18:16.930 --> 18:22.186
I've got a new philosophy

18:23.228 --> 18:27.107
Find that bridge
And cross it now

18:27.191 --> 18:31.361
Find that bridge
And cross it right now

18:31.445 --> 18:35.824
Let the other gals keep waiting
Wasting time, procrastinating

18:35.908 --> 18:39.286
Find that bridge
And cross it right now

18:39.369 --> 18:41.288
-Find that guy
-Find that guy

18:41.371 --> 18:43.373
-And get that ring
-And get that ring

18:43.457 --> 18:47.586
Find that guy
And getcha that ring

18:47.669 --> 18:51.715
Let the other ladies falter
As they're racing for the altar

18:51.798 --> 18:56.345
Find that guy
And getcha that ring, ring, ring

18:56.428 --> 19:00.098
Here come the groom, here come the bride
Let's all meet 'em on the other side

19:00.182 --> 19:04.269
Here come the groom, here come the bride
Let's all meet 'em on the other side

19:04.353 --> 19:08.607
Let's all meet 'em on the other side
Let's all meet 'em on the other side

19:12.778 --> 19:15.906
I'm sorry. I hate-- Good to-- Bye.

19:16.657 --> 19:20.744
It's not a metaphor
Oh, no, it's something more

19:20.827 --> 19:24.665
It's a literal bridge

19:24.748 --> 19:29.878
Sister, get that mister

19:29.962 --> 19:32.381
Go get him

19:33.340 --> 19:37.052
It's not a metaphor
Oh, no, it's something more

19:37.135 --> 19:39.847
It's a literal bridge

19:39.930 --> 19:40.931
No.

19:41.014 --> 19:46.186
Sister, get that mister

19:46.270 --> 19:48.480
Go get him

19:48.564 --> 19:51.525
-Find that bridge and cross it now
-It's not a metaphor

19:51.608 --> 19:53.402
Oh, no, it's something more

19:53.485 --> 19:56.363
-Find that bridge and cross it right now
-It's a literal bridge

19:56.446 --> 19:58.907
-Next, please. Go.
-Every day you're hesitating

19:58.991 --> 20:00.617
Is a day your looks are fading

20:00.701 --> 20:02.035
Find that bridge

20:02.119 --> 20:04.955
-And cross it right now
-Okay. All right. As I suspected.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.375
Find that bridge and cross it now

20:09.459 --> 20:10.919
Someone's gotta be the right one!

20:11.003 --> 20:13.088
Find that bridge and cross it right
Oh, cross it now

20:13.172 --> 20:17.176
All the gals who dillydally
End up dying in an alley

20:17.259 --> 20:23.891
Find that bridge
And cross it right now

20:23.974 --> 20:25.601
Cross that bridge right now!

20:26.310 --> 20:28.854
All right, who's next?

20:30.105 --> 20:31.857
Come on, that can't be everyone.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.359
Really? There's no one left?

20:36.445 --> 20:37.446
Yes!

20:39.907 --> 20:42.284
-Unbelievable.
-Mel.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.952
This is what you've been doing all day?

20:44.036 --> 20:45.037
It was an experiment.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.456
I was trying to figure out a way
to get us out of here.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.082
You mean for you to get out of here?

20:49.166 --> 20:53.253
While I run around town
trying to find a place for us to stay?

20:54.254 --> 20:57.841
It's like you are incapable
of doing anything

20:57.925 --> 21:00.969
but whatever takes the least amount
of emotional effort.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.055
For the record,
I don't know how you define "effort,"

21:03.138 --> 21:04.473
but there was a huge dance number.

21:05.807 --> 21:07.726
-Goodbye, Josh.
-Mel-- Mel, come on.

21:07.809 --> 21:11.021
No, no, no.
Clearly we're just out for ourselves now.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.482
-Mel.
-Screw you, Josh.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.363
You broke my daughter's heart.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.074
-She told Papa!
-You're dead meat.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.161
Yeah, that's a real gun.

21:26.245 --> 21:27.371
Get back here, you!

21:28.580 --> 21:30.541
Ouch! My bottom!

21:30.624 --> 21:31.834
Sorry, Pete!

21:47.724 --> 21:49.726
This sucks!

21:51.311 --> 21:52.312
Dr. Skinner?

21:52.396 --> 21:55.524
Hi, Reverend. Sorry, I--
Are you open, or...

21:55.607 --> 21:59.027
The house of the Lord is always open.
Stay as long as you'd like.

21:59.111 --> 22:00.404
Beats going home, right?

22:03.615 --> 22:04.867
Is something bothering you?

22:07.953 --> 22:09.371
Sure, why not?

22:17.129 --> 22:19.131
I've had a rough couple of days here, Rev.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.883
My girlfriend and I broke up,

22:20.966 --> 22:25.095
then I was forced to propose at gunpoint,
and now it seems like I'm stuck here.

22:25.179 --> 22:29.391
Because apparently there's no way for me
to find true love. Whatever that means.

22:29.474 --> 22:33.061
Well, the good book has
something to say about that.

22:34.062 --> 22:37.608
"True love bears all things,
believes all things,

22:37.691 --> 22:40.652
hopes all things, and endures all things."

22:42.237 --> 22:43.947
In other words, it's a lot of work.

22:44.031 --> 22:46.992
So, it's probably not something you find.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.077
It's probably something you make.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.581
But what if I--

22:53.957 --> 22:55.876
What if I'm just not capable of that?

22:59.546 --> 23:02.090
If that's Farmer McDonough,
tell him I've left town.

23:07.596 --> 23:09.473
Emma, what brings you by so late?

23:09.556 --> 23:12.726
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep,
so I cleaned out Carson's closet.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.269
I thought the poor could use these.

23:14.353 --> 23:18.232
Emma, this is wonderful.
We needed more sailor suits, thank you.

23:18.315 --> 23:21.401
Don't worry about it, Reverend.
See you at the bake sale.

23:24.279 --> 23:27.366
Now, to answer your question,
I believe that everyone--

23:27.449 --> 23:28.700
Who was that?

23:28.784 --> 23:30.577
Emma Tate, the schoolmarm.

23:30.661 --> 23:34.331
Schoolmarm? And "marm" is what, again?
Does that mean she's married, or--

23:34.414 --> 23:37.793
Oh, no. Emma's made it abundantly clear
she's got no use for marriage.

23:39.378 --> 23:40.838
I wish I'd had her strength.

23:43.841 --> 23:46.093
She didn't try
to cross the bridge with me.

23:46.718 --> 23:47.761
It's gotta be her.

23:55.018 --> 23:59.982
So, here I am
Back on my own

24:00.065 --> 24:04.194
Wanderin' the streets of town alone

24:05.070 --> 24:09.533
Things with Josh have gone from
Bad to worse

24:11.243 --> 24:13.412
Guess it's time to--

24:17.416 --> 24:19.459
-Yes?
-Doc Lopez?

24:19.543 --> 24:21.420
-That's me.
-Who is it, dear?

24:21.503 --> 24:24.631
I'm Melissa Gimble.
I'm here about the nurse position.

24:24.715 --> 24:28.594
Oh, then you have the wrong Doc Lopez.
One moment.

24:28.677 --> 24:30.053
You'll be wanting our son.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.097
Jorge, someone's here to see you.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.686
Hello.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.609
Yee honk.

24:48.405 --> 24:52.284
Find that bridge
And cross it now

24:52.367 --> 24:56.538
Find that bridge
And cross it right now

24:56.622 --> 25:01.001
Let the other gals keep waiting
Wasting time, procrastinating

25:01.084 --> 25:04.463
Find that bridge
And cross it right now

25:04.546 --> 25:06.465
-Find that guy
-Find that guy

25:06.548 --> 25:08.550
-And get that ring
-And get that ring

25:08.634 --> 25:12.763
Find that guy
And getcha that ring

25:12.846 --> 25:16.892
Let the other ladies falter
As they're racing for the altar

25:16.975 --> 25:21.522
Find that guy
And getcha that ring, ring, ring

25:21.605 --> 25:25.526
Here come the groom, here come the bride
Let's all meet 'em on the other side

25:25.609 --> 25:27.861
Let's all meet 'em on the other side

25:35.244 --> 25:39.039
It's not a metaphor
Oh, no, it's something more

25:39.122 --> 25:43.126
It's a literal bridge

25:43.210 --> 25:48.048
Sister, get that mister

25:48.131 --> 25:50.551
Go get him

25:50.634 --> 25:54.513
Find that bridge and cross it now

25:54.596 --> 25:58.851
Find that bridge and cross it right
Oh, cross it now

25:58.934 --> 26:02.938
All the gals who dillydally
End up dying in an alley

26:03.021 --> 26:09.653
Find that bridge
And cross it right now

26:09.736 --> 26:11.363
Cross that bridge right now
