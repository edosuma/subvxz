00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:07.338 --> 00:08.929
Kaz, buddy,

00:08.929 --> 00:12.513
there's plenty of room
over here. You don't have to eat
on the floor.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.845
I'm not eating on the floor.

00:14.845 --> 00:18.059
I'm preparing my food
on the floor.

00:18.059 --> 00:21.562
Ooh, my favorite,
hot dogs on a rake!

00:23.604 --> 00:28.319
Wow, you actually made tubes
of random animal parts
even more disgusting.

00:28.319 --> 00:32.863
Hey, they only look gross
because I haven't grilled
them yet.

00:35.956 --> 00:37.078
( chuckles )

00:41.922 --> 00:44.375
Who's disgusting now?

00:45.376 --> 00:46.467
Oh.

00:46.467 --> 00:50.131
Oh. Wet leaf. ( laughs )

00:50.131 --> 00:54.135
Yeah, You do know I just used
that rake to clean
the gutters. Right?

00:54.135 --> 00:57.768
Mmm, you can taste
yesterday's rain.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.773
You boys are ridiculous.
Your powers are a gift.

01:02.773 --> 01:05.025
You shouldn't be wasting
them on trivial things.

01:05.025 --> 01:08.189
Yeah, you guys are always
using your powers
when you don't have to.

01:08.189 --> 01:12.783
Yesterday Oliver flew across
the street just
to go to the grocery store.

01:12.783 --> 01:15.576
That was an emergency.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.999
We were out of Loopy Loops.

01:18.999 --> 01:21.252
And you know what,
for your information,

01:21.252 --> 01:23.414
girls are just as bad.

01:23.414 --> 01:26.917
When Mr. Davenport called, you
used your vocal manipulation
to pretend to be me.

01:26.917 --> 01:30.090
OK, calm down, all I said was...

01:30.090 --> 01:32.923
( in Kaz's voice ) Bree's
not here. Stop calling, old man.

01:32.923 --> 01:35.386
Oh, so you made me look bad?

01:35.386 --> 01:39.560
Yes, that was the goal.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.224
And, yes, I occasionally
use bionics to make
my life easier.

01:43.224 --> 01:46.937
But I can stop whenever I want.
You guys are the ones
that have no control.

01:46.937 --> 01:48.108
Oh, really?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.031
Well, then I propose
a challenge, guys versus girls,

01:51.031 --> 01:54.405
to see who
can go the longest without using
bionic abilities or superpowers.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.447
Last man or woman
standing wins.

01:56.447 --> 01:58.409
You're on.

01:59.910 --> 02:02.002
CHASE: I'm in.
SKYLAR: Me too.

02:02.002 --> 02:05.796
OLIVER: I just want
to touch Skylar's hand.

02:05.796 --> 02:08.008
You ladies are going down.

02:08.008 --> 02:10.881
I mean, when you calculate
the statistical odds

02:10.881 --> 02:14.305
and factor in the lopsided ratio
of the three of us
against two of you,

02:14.305 --> 02:17.678
the boys have an 86.37
percent chance of winning.

02:17.678 --> 02:19.430
Interesting.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.183
And how exactly did you
calculate those odds?

02:24.024 --> 02:25.476
Yeah, I'm out.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.440
( theme music playing )

03:12.903 --> 03:14.575
Hey, Douglas, whatcha up to?

03:14.575 --> 03:17.988
Just looking for a place nearby
to grab a nice macaroon.

03:17.988 --> 03:20.451
( clicks tongue )

03:20.451 --> 03:22.082
A macaroon?

03:22.082 --> 03:23.454
Hey,

03:23.454 --> 03:25.125
just because I'm a little
rough around the edges

03:25.125 --> 03:29.290
doesn't mean I can't enjoy
a sophisticated treat.

03:29.290 --> 03:32.463
By the way, you need
to be more careful.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.926
It's your job to secure
this place and you left
that rock wall open last night.

03:35.926 --> 03:38.679
( scoffs ) What?
No, I didn't.

03:38.679 --> 03:41.101
I locked down the entire
perimeter before I went to bed.

03:41.101 --> 03:44.895
Well, I was the first one
down here this morning
and it was wide open.

03:44.895 --> 03:46.847
Let me check last night's
security footage.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.022
( beeping )

03:52.022 --> 03:56.277
That's weird. It's been wiped.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.739
I bet it was Roman and Riker!

04:00.030 --> 04:01.662
Freeze!

04:05.366 --> 04:06.667
Who are you?

04:06.667 --> 04:10.751
My name's AJ.
I live a floor below you guys.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.965
Are you gonna drop the weapon
or are you really afraid
of a little kid?

04:17.508 --> 04:19.009
Why haven't we seen you before?

04:19.009 --> 04:21.091
I like to keep to myself.

04:21.091 --> 04:25.766
A man of mystery, if you will.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.978
But I know all about you guys.

04:27.978 --> 04:29.980
The Elite Force!

04:31.392 --> 04:33.023
How did you even get down here?

04:33.023 --> 04:36.066
It's surrounded
by walls of solid rock.

04:36.066 --> 04:38.569
Well, I was checking
on the building's
energy consumption

04:38.569 --> 04:41.822
and I noticed an unusually
high drain coming
from below the building.

04:41.822 --> 04:45.576
Wait, you check the building's
energy consumption?

04:45.576 --> 04:49.540
Of course. Gotta keep tabs
on all the over-users.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.963
The future is green, my man.

04:52.963 --> 04:55.376
Anyway, I used
a structural entometer

04:55.376 --> 04:57.628
to scan the area
and locate the room.

04:57.628 --> 05:00.841
Then I cracked the security code
and I've been coming
here ever since.

05:00.841 --> 05:02.723
Ever since?

05:02.723 --> 05:04.264
How often do you come here?

05:04.264 --> 05:08.308
( chuckles ) A lot more
than you'd like.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.690
My parents work a lot

05:09.690 --> 05:12.483
so I figured why hang
out at home when...

05:12.483 --> 05:15.486
I can hang here with all
this cool technology.

05:15.486 --> 05:20.651
I just had to copy your online
calendar so I'd know when
to slip in undetected.

05:20.651 --> 05:23.784
You copied our calendar?

05:23.784 --> 05:25.205
Yeah.

05:25.205 --> 05:26.577
Which reminds me...

05:26.577 --> 05:29.209
aren't you supposed
to be at a dentist appointment
right now?

05:29.209 --> 05:31.872
No, no. He rescheduled it
so he could sleep in.

05:31.872 --> 05:35.456
Wait. Why am I telling you this?

05:35.456 --> 05:39.420
I know I should be upset
by this massive
security breach,

05:39.420 --> 05:44.094
but you wigging out
over a ten-year-old
is kinda fun to watch.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.517
OK, it's time for you to go.

05:46.517 --> 05:49.390
I'm changing all the passwords
so this doesn't happen again.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.101
Goodbye, AJ.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.683
Fine, I'll go.

05:52.683 --> 05:55.436
But just so you know, I have
a photographic memory

05:55.436 --> 05:59.650
which means the schedule's
up here too.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.783
Oh, yeah? Then what am I doing
tomorrow night?

06:02.783 --> 06:04.364
Same thing you do every
Saturday night.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.576
Nothing.

06:11.792 --> 06:14.705
Guys! You'll never believe
who I saw in the front
of our building!

06:14.705 --> 06:16.917
Harry Styles from One Direction!

06:16.917 --> 06:17.958
What?!

06:20.671 --> 06:24.925
( panting ) He wasn't there.

06:24.925 --> 06:26.967
Ha! That's because

06:26.967 --> 06:29.099
he's actually
in Brisbane, Australia

06:29.099 --> 06:31.562
where he has a concert tonight
before heading back to England

06:31.562 --> 06:37.187
for some much needed R&R
from his overly hectic schedule.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.650
I've heard.

06:39.650 --> 06:43.073
You used your super speed!
You're out of the contest!

06:43.073 --> 06:44.364
That was low.

06:44.364 --> 06:46.156
Nobody said
we couldn't play dirty.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.328
Yeah and now
it's two against one.

06:48.328 --> 06:50.991
Advantage, guys. ( laughs )

06:50.991 --> 06:52.453
All right.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.374
I see how it is.

06:54.374 --> 06:56.667
But just because I'm out,

06:56.667 --> 06:59.089
it doesn't mean I can't help
my girl win.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.300
Oh, it's okay, Bree,
I don't need your help--

07:00.300 --> 07:02.132
This is not about you,
it's about me.

07:05.636 --> 07:08.929
So I've upgraded
the entire Mission Command
security system.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.261
No need to remember
passwords anymore because

07:11.261 --> 07:14.224
I installed optical retina scans
at every point of entry.

07:14.224 --> 07:17.357
There is absolutely no way that
kid is getting back in here!

07:17.357 --> 07:18.559
That'll show 'em!

07:18.559 --> 07:21.191
( yelling )

07:21.191 --> 07:23.984
That's a sick weapons area
you got behind the rock wall.

07:23.984 --> 07:28.238
I can see why you'd want
to keep people out of it.

07:28.238 --> 07:32.242
You know, if the smartest man
in the world is in charge
of security

07:32.242 --> 07:34.244
and that kid got past it,

07:34.244 --> 07:36.917
doesn't that make him
the smartest man in the world?
( chuckles )

07:36.917 --> 07:38.999
( chuckles ) Yeah, well,
I mean,

07:38.999 --> 07:43.754
you created me so technically
that would make it your failure.

07:43.754 --> 07:47.387
Get out of here, kid!

07:47.387 --> 07:51.141
Hold on. I came back
to offer you a proposition.

07:51.141 --> 07:53.303
You said this place is only
for members of the Elite Force.

07:53.303 --> 07:59.269
But I know a lot about you guys
and I think I can be an asset,
so I want to join the team.

07:59.269 --> 08:05.315
Ha! You? Sorry, kid,
I don't think they make mission
suits in an extra small.

08:05.315 --> 08:09.780
Yours is extra...
Just the pants!

08:09.780 --> 08:13.323
Look, I may only be ten,
but I'm good with computers,

08:13.323 --> 08:15.245
I know every
street in this city,

08:15.245 --> 08:20.040
and, well, it's glaringly
obvious that you need help
with the security system.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.832
I mean, retina scans?

08:21.832 --> 08:24.254
Why not just leave
a key under the mat?

08:26.927 --> 08:28.508
He's does have a point.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.391
It would be good to have a pair
of fresh eyes around here

08:31.391 --> 08:33.013
pointing out our weaknesses,

08:33.013 --> 08:34.635
making us up our game.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.096
No!

08:36.096 --> 08:38.308
We do not need
this kid on the team.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.980
I think you do.

08:39.980 --> 08:42.773
And to prove it,
let's make a deal.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.354
If I get back in here,

08:44.354 --> 08:46.446
I'm on the team.

08:46.446 --> 08:48.318
Fine, deal.

08:49.860 --> 08:52.412
Your hands are sweaty. Nervous?

08:52.412 --> 08:54.705
No! They're naturally clammy.

08:59.419 --> 09:01.251
( ding )

09:01.251 --> 09:04.665
Ah. Hello, old friend.

09:04.665 --> 09:09.339
What do you say we get some
butter and make this a party?

09:09.339 --> 09:12.262
What the? Bree!

09:12.262 --> 09:14.514
You know what's funny?
I don't even like toast.

09:14.514 --> 09:17.728
But because it's yours,
it's delicious.

09:21.521 --> 09:22.773
What you watching?

09:22.773 --> 09:24.104
Just a video.

09:24.104 --> 09:25.275
( gargling )

09:25.275 --> 09:27.988
Is that me gargling
mouthwash?

09:27.988 --> 09:31.361
I'm a weird dude.
We've been over this.

09:33.113 --> 09:35.495
Hey, Oliver. It's really hot

09:35.495 --> 09:37.998
and I don't think
the AC is working.

09:37.998 --> 09:41.331
Would you mind using
your cryo-blast to cool me off?

09:41.331 --> 09:45.045
You don't know how long
I've waited for you
to ask me that.

09:45.045 --> 09:47.417
KAZ: Oliver, no! No! No!

09:47.417 --> 09:51.712
She's trying to get you
to use your powers
so you'll lose the contest.

09:51.712 --> 09:55.766
Who, me?

09:55.766 --> 09:58.478
Skylar, I spend my precious time
lurking in the shadows

09:58.478 --> 10:01.431
filming you and this is how
you treat me?

10:01.431 --> 10:04.775
Hey, Oliver, can I borrow
your phone real quick?
I can't find mine.

10:04.775 --> 10:05.986
Yeah, sure.

10:05.986 --> 10:07.567
Thanks.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.569
Wait, Bree, where are you going?

10:09.569 --> 10:13.153
I'm just trying to find
better reception.

10:13.153 --> 10:15.656
What's that no-good
toast thief up to?

10:18.408 --> 10:19.740
( sighs ) There.

10:19.740 --> 10:21.742
Perfect service.

10:21.742 --> 10:22.743
( yells )

10:22.743 --> 10:24.414
No, Oliver, don't fly!

10:24.414 --> 10:26.626
Don't fly!

10:26.626 --> 10:28.298
And he's out.

10:28.298 --> 10:33.253
Oh, yeah. Well, looks like
it's just you and me, Kaz.

10:35.345 --> 10:37.257
( impact grunts )

10:37.257 --> 10:42.392
I may have lost the contest
but at least I saved
my 41-hour Skylar movie!

10:42.392 --> 10:46.857
Wait, 42. I forgot about
this morning's nail
clipping session.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.480
Hey, can I see it?

10:50.480 --> 10:51.441
Sure. Here.

10:56.276 --> 10:57.537
My phone!

10:57.537 --> 11:00.040
I find you creepy,
we've been over this.

11:05.625 --> 11:09.790
Mmm! You were right
about these macaroons.
They are great.

11:12.342 --> 11:16.256
All right, last but not least,
our online calendar
is all secure.

11:16.256 --> 11:21.601
It'd take about two years
of decoding for any outsider
to even see when my birthday is.

11:21.601 --> 11:24.104
June 1st?

11:24.104 --> 11:25.515
August 5th.

11:25.515 --> 11:27.477
But close, Dad.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.903
Well, twenty-four hours
and no AJ.

11:32.903 --> 11:34.694
I successfully locked him out!

11:34.694 --> 11:40.320
No one makes a fool
of Chase Davenport
and gets away with it! No one!

11:40.320 --> 11:43.323
( machines whirring )

11:43.323 --> 11:45.535
Hey! What are you doing?

11:45.535 --> 11:49.129
Disarming the security system
I worked so hard to perfect.

11:49.129 --> 11:50.630
Why?

11:50.630 --> 11:52.833
I don't know!

11:52.833 --> 11:55.425
My mind is telling me
to do it even though
I don't want to.

11:55.425 --> 11:58.598
Also, I'm proud to announce
that I am the dumbest man
in the world!

11:58.598 --> 11:59.679
( gasps )

12:03.223 --> 12:04.975
AJ! What'd you do?

12:04.975 --> 12:10.440
I re-programmed Chase's bionic
chip so I could control it.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.482
You what?

12:12.482 --> 12:15.856
That's right, I didn't
have to break
into Mission Command.

12:15.856 --> 12:18.658
I broke into you!

12:24.825 --> 12:26.246
( laughing )

12:26.246 --> 12:28.248
I'm really impressed
that you tapped into my chip.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.372
You are so much
smarter than I am.

12:32.372 --> 12:35.135
Hey, stop making me say things!

12:35.135 --> 12:37.467
And stop making me clap!

12:37.467 --> 12:38.588
Fine!

12:38.588 --> 12:39.679
( tablet beeps )

12:39.679 --> 12:44.805
( laughing )

12:44.805 --> 12:48.648
Stop encouraging him,
this is a major security breach!

12:48.648 --> 12:51.231
All right! Fine!

12:51.231 --> 12:54.985
Fun's over!
AJ, give me the tablet.

12:58.899 --> 13:02.823
( Chase grunts )

13:02.823 --> 13:04.404
( strained ) Ow!

13:06.746 --> 13:08.578
Douglas, what's going on?

13:08.578 --> 13:11.251
When AJ tapped into your chip
he must have caused a glitch.

13:11.251 --> 13:14.544
Your magnetism app
has gone haywire. Oh, no!

13:14.544 --> 13:17.127
It's a heavy bracelet day!

13:17.127 --> 13:21.051
( grunting )

13:21.051 --> 13:23.633
See, this is why kids
shouldn't play with technology.

13:27.727 --> 13:30.350
Hey, Kaz. ( giggles )

13:30.350 --> 13:33.773
Look what I have!

13:33.773 --> 13:35.065
My phone?

13:35.065 --> 13:37.027
Oop!

13:37.027 --> 13:39.569
Aren't you gonna fly down
and go get it?

13:39.569 --> 13:41.741
Nah, it's good.

13:41.741 --> 13:44.704
I've been meaning
to get back into letter writing.

13:44.704 --> 13:48.118
Oh. OK. Well...

13:48.118 --> 13:51.121
look what else I have.

13:51.121 --> 13:54.294
My brand-new limited
edition high tops?

13:54.294 --> 13:56.626
Oh, oops.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.170
( strained ) Please stop.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.883
Oh, I am just getting started.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.345
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go back up
to your room

14:05.345 --> 14:06.726
and throw out all your clothes.

14:06.726 --> 14:09.930
That's right, it's gonna
be raining tightey-whiteys.

14:13.643 --> 14:15.936
Bree is a she-devil!

14:15.936 --> 14:18.528
I'm never gonna win this thing.
Yeah, you will.

14:18.528 --> 14:22.152
We just need to throw Skylar
off her game and get her
to use her powers.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.534
And if anyone can get her
to do something,

14:24.534 --> 14:27.827
it's this guy.

14:27.827 --> 14:29.950
Sorry, buddy, but
the only thing you're good at

14:29.950 --> 14:32.702
getting Skylar to do
is reject you.

14:32.702 --> 14:37.417
She is not rejecting me,
she is waiting for our love
to blossom.

14:37.417 --> 14:42.092
And this is about something
bigger. It's about us men
sticking up for each other.

14:42.092 --> 14:43.593
BREE: Oh, Kaz!

14:48.218 --> 14:50.600
Do it! Do it, now!

14:52.722 --> 14:56.186
OK. I'll use my cryo-blast
to freeze her in a block of ice,

14:56.186 --> 14:59.779
and then she'll be forced
to use her lightning powers
to break herself out.

14:59.779 --> 15:01.821
Love it! Here she comes.

15:01.821 --> 15:03.233
This is for men everywhere!

15:03.233 --> 15:04.654
Hey, Oliver.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.827
I can't do it,
she said the magic words.

15:13.743 --> 15:17.037
Well, this is unpleasant.

15:19.169 --> 15:23.173
Kinda wish some of that metal
would've covered his mouth.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.096
Got anymore bracelets?

15:26.096 --> 15:29.099
Just do something!
I'm trying here!

15:29.099 --> 15:32.602
But every time I try
to fix your chip remotely,
the magnet gets stronger.

15:35.685 --> 15:40.020
I hadn't noticed.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.232
Can't you use your force field?

15:42.232 --> 15:45.065
No!

15:45.065 --> 15:48.989
The glitch is overriding
everything. I can't use any
of my abilities

15:48.989 --> 15:51.451
What if we create
a human shield around you?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.664
It won't stop the magnetic pull
but by blocking its path

15:54.664 --> 15:57.707
with our bodies,
we might slow it down.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.880
But if it doesn't work
and the magnet just keeps
getting stronger...

16:00.880 --> 16:05.505
Every heavy thing
in this room will take
AJ and me out first.

16:05.505 --> 16:07.677
Yeah, I'm willing
to take that risk.

16:07.677 --> 16:09.139
( rumbling )

16:09.139 --> 16:10.680
Oh, no!

16:10.680 --> 16:12.052
This is the worst room to be in.

16:12.052 --> 16:14.264
Donnie built it out
of reinforced steel.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.726
We have to get you upstairs now!
Lets go!

16:16.726 --> 16:17.857
( effort grunts )

16:22.102 --> 16:23.863
( effort grunts )

16:23.863 --> 16:27.907
Aww, is it National Hug Day?
Bring it in.

16:27.907 --> 16:30.490
It's gonna take more than
a holiday to make that happen.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.744
What's going on?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.876
And who's the kid?

16:36.876 --> 16:39.169
AJ. He lives downstairs.

16:39.169 --> 16:43.543
He tapped into Chase's chip
with his tablet and it's causing
his magnetism app to glitch.

16:43.543 --> 16:48.048
Tragic but hysterical.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.181
Or maybe just hysterical.
( laughs )

16:51.181 --> 16:53.763
I have to find a way
to fix his glitch remotely.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.475
But when I break
the human shield

16:55.475 --> 16:58.898
every metal object in this room
is gonna go flying toward Chase.

16:58.898 --> 17:01.941
I'm not hearing a problem.

17:01.941 --> 17:04.444
When I let go, I need you guys
to use your powers

17:04.444 --> 17:07.737
to protect Chase from being hit
by all the heavy objects.

17:07.737 --> 17:11.151
Yeah, we can't do that.
Why not?

17:11.151 --> 17:14.244
Oh, see, we're having
this little challenge,
guys versus girls,

17:14.244 --> 17:17.747
to see who can go the longest
without using their powers
for trivial things.

17:17.747 --> 17:21.791
Saving my life
is not a trivial thing!

17:21.791 --> 17:24.334
I don't know.
Should we take a vote?

17:24.334 --> 17:26.876
Just put your challenge on hold.

17:26.876 --> 17:31.381
I need you guys to buy me
some time so I can try
to fix the glitch.

17:31.381 --> 17:32.762
ALL: Fine.

17:32.762 --> 17:35.765
( rumbling )

17:42.142 --> 17:44.944
Watch out! The table!

17:44.944 --> 17:45.815
Oliver!

17:53.903 --> 17:56.456
Hurry! We can't keep
this up forever!

17:56.456 --> 17:59.369
Oh, no, kid's amping up.

17:59.369 --> 18:04.204
His magnetism app is gonna rip
the framework of the room
right out of the walls!

18:04.204 --> 18:05.835
Wait a second.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.877
Can't his capsule reset
his operating system

18:07.877 --> 18:11.841
and bring his magnetism app back
to its original state?

18:11.841 --> 18:14.804
Yes, yes it can.

18:17.717 --> 18:19.679
Hurry, the whole room
is going to implode!

18:19.679 --> 18:22.682
Protect Chase. I'll use
my super strength
to bring his capsule down here.

18:22.682 --> 18:25.855
Wait! I'll help you!

18:25.855 --> 18:27.026
BREE: Got it!

18:34.033 --> 18:35.074
There.

18:35.074 --> 18:39.499
That...should...do it!

18:39.499 --> 18:43.413
( all cheer )

18:43.413 --> 18:44.624
You alright?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
Yeah, I think so.

18:46.626 --> 18:50.340
But my back is killing me.

18:50.340 --> 18:51.841
Sorry to hear it.
Contest back on!

18:51.841 --> 18:52.842
Whoo!

19:02.222 --> 19:04.894
I know you're here.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.396
Hi, Chase.

19:07.857 --> 19:09.108
What's the matter?

19:09.108 --> 19:10.690
Couldn't kill me
the first time?

19:10.690 --> 19:13.323
Came back to finish the job?

19:13.323 --> 19:15.235
No.

19:15.235 --> 19:17.487
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.699
I was just trying to show you
what I could do,

19:19.699 --> 19:21.951
I didn't mean for all that
to happen.

19:21.951 --> 19:26.786
Yeah, well, that's the reason
I didn't want you around here
in the first place.

19:26.786 --> 19:28.548
I know.

19:28.548 --> 19:31.791
And I promise I won't come back.

19:31.791 --> 19:34.254
It's obvious I'm not ready
to be a part of the team.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.891
Wait.

19:43.893 --> 19:45.725
You getting in here,

19:45.725 --> 19:48.728
tapping into my chip,

19:48.728 --> 19:51.110
it's pretty impressive.

19:51.110 --> 19:53.363
And not just for a ten-year-old.

19:53.363 --> 19:55.865
Really?
Yeah.

19:55.865 --> 19:59.028
You just think you know
a little bit more
than you actually do.

19:59.028 --> 20:05.034
And I can kinda, barely,
not really relate to that.

20:05.034 --> 20:07.457
So are you saying
I'm a part of the team?

20:07.457 --> 20:10.670
( laughs ) No!

20:10.670 --> 20:14.634
But if you wanted to come by,
you know, occasionally...

20:14.634 --> 20:17.507
I won't keep you out.

20:17.507 --> 20:20.139
Thanks, Chase.

20:20.139 --> 20:21.641
But for what it's worth...

20:21.641 --> 20:24.103
( chuckles )
You wouldn't be able to anyway.

20:33.062 --> 20:36.566
What's up, Kaz?
Wanna torch some weinies?

20:36.566 --> 20:40.950
No way, dude. I'm this close
to beating Skylar
in the contest.

20:40.950 --> 20:44.073
Don't worry, the girls
just left, it's totally safe.

20:44.073 --> 20:47.076
Well, then let's fire up
the grill!

20:54.133 --> 20:57.757
And you're out. Girls win!

20:59.178 --> 21:00.340
What?

21:00.340 --> 21:01.431
Oops.

21:06.145 --> 21:08.978
Girls win!

21:08.978 --> 21:12.652
You cyber cloaked me?
That's right.

21:12.652 --> 21:18.398
The real Oliver is curled up
under the sink waiting for me
to brush my teeth.

21:18.398 --> 21:21.401
Well, at least
I still got my dogs.

21:21.401 --> 21:22.742
Actually...

21:25.074 --> 21:26.406
You don't.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.169
Now those are worth flying for.

21:34.624 --> 21:35.755
Whoo!
