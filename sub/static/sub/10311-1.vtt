00:43.960 --> 00:46.327
I heard she was
moved to another room.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.442
Mrs. Larson?

00:57.080 --> 00:58.491
It...

01:00.800 --> 01:03.087
It won't be much longer, Mrs.
Larson.

01:05.640 --> 01:09.361
Oh. Well, is he
in a lot of pain?

01:09.440 --> 01:11.249
No. No, no.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.086
There'll be no more pain for your husband.
He's heavily sedated.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.081
Okay. I think I'm gonna go
send little Hal in now.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.811
No. No, no. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.121
With all the painkillers,

01:27.520 --> 01:30.205
the Reverend's
not exactly himself.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.921
Look, I think my boy has a right
to say goodbye to his father.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.447
I mean, the man means
everything in the world to him.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.048
Well, your call.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.691
Nurse?

01:50.040 --> 01:51.963
Yes, Reverend Larson?

01:52.040 --> 01:54.042
Did you see the cowboy?

01:54.120 --> 01:55.849
The cowboy?

01:55.920 --> 02:00.767
The cowboy who gave me the
singing nickel in Pudding Town?

02:00.840 --> 02:05.164
Okay, think it's time to
turn down the morphine drip.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.087
Reverend Larson?
Your son is here.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.329
Okay, sure.
Send her in.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.004
Ladies?

02:19.080 --> 02:21.082
A little privacy.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.931
Dad?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.327
It's me, Dad. Hal.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.801
Oh. Glad you're here,
kiddo.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.530
Got a few things
to tell ya.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.523
First, I want you
to promise

02:58.600 --> 03:01.444
that no matter
what you do in life,

03:01.520 --> 03:04.569
you will never, ever
settle for average.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.645
Yes, sir.

03:07.720 --> 03:12.282
Second, don't be satisfied
with routine poontang.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.929
Don't do what I did.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.491
I married for love, and your
mother Betty has been a nightmare.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.009
But, Dad, Mom's
name is Marian.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.521
Listen to me.
I'm giving you pearls here.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.486
And third, find yourself

03:38.480 --> 03:40.642
a classic beauty

03:42.760 --> 03:44.922
with a perfect can

03:46.320 --> 03:48.687
and great toddies.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.081
That will put you in good
stead with the Lord.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.083
It's all in here.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.482
Yes, sir.

03:58.680 --> 04:03.481
Hot, young tail's
what it's all about.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.243
Hot.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.802
Young tail.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.967
I'll make you proud, Papa.

05:12.440 --> 05:17.082
<i>Uncle Larry's
hooked on ice again</i>

05:20.120 --> 05:24.444
<i>He seems to be
stuck in the '80s</i>

05:27.960 --> 05:32.249
<i>He wears his
Members Only jacket</i>

05:35.600 --> 05:40.970
<i>'Cause he thinks
it turns on all the ladies</i>

05:43.640 --> 05:48.168
<i>And all the white folks
shake their asses</i>

05:51.920 --> 05:55.402
<i>Looking for the two and four</i>

05:59.600 --> 06:03.730
<i>I'll have mine
in martini glasses</i>

06:07.360 --> 06:11.331
<i>'Cause I can't
take it any more</i>

06:19.280 --> 06:23.888
<i>These are the days
of empty kitchens</i>

06:26.200 --> 06:31.445
<i>The rise and fall
of Mary Ellen's hairdo</i>

06:33.840 --> 06:36.241
Excuse me, jackass.
Can you not hear me down there?

06:36.320 --> 06:38.766
I want nothing to do with
you, you little warthog.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.208
You had me
at "Get lost."

06:45.560 --> 06:46.641
Hey, what's up, Mauricio?

06:46.760 --> 06:47.761
Hey, Hal.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.966
How's the crowd tonight?

06:49.040 --> 06:50.201
Good. I got a few bites.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.851
Yeah? Can I
get you a drink?

06:52.920 --> 06:54.968
I won't say no to that.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.810
Two beers.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.723
- Two Buds?
- Two Buds.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.649
So, I didn't expect
to see you here.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.529
Where's your
new girl Loni?

07:05.600 --> 07:07.204
- Lindy.
- Lindy.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.527
- She's...
- Here you go.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.002
Actually, I didn't tell her
I was going out tonight.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.122
Why not? Things
okay with you guys?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.806
Yeah. A little too okay, if you
know what I'm talking about.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.043
No, I don't know.
What's that mean?

07:23.120 --> 07:24.610
Things are going
in the shitter.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.048
Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?

07:28.120 --> 07:30.168
She's not.
I'm dumping her.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.321
You're dumping Loni?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.841
Lindy. Are you crazy?
Lindy's gorgeous.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.970
On the surface, but when you
get to know her better,

07:38.040 --> 07:39.644
there's a whole
other story goin' on.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.643
Yeah? How goes that?

07:41.720 --> 07:45.884
We're sitting there, you know,
and she's got her bare...

07:45.960 --> 07:47.450
Her bare feet
were on the couch,

07:47.520 --> 07:49.921
and I notice that
her second toe is, like,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.651
half an inch longer
than her big toe.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.568
That's it?
You're breaking up over that?

07:56.360 --> 07:57.885
Hey, I don't need
that circus shit.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.850
Well, couldn't she get the
toe filed down or something?

08:01.560 --> 08:03.688
What, then
I'm dating a nub?

08:04.640 --> 08:06.847
I'm starting to think
we're jinxed here.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.400
Speak for yourself,
my friend.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.686
What, you got
the promotion?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.484
I don't hear about
that till tomorrow.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.326
But guess who is now officially
going out with Jill.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.607
Jill? Your neighbor Jill?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.603
You're going
out with Jill?

08:20.760 --> 08:22.125
And she doesn't
exactly hate me.

08:23.120 --> 08:28.081
Get out! You are the
luckiest man on the planet.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.205
So what are you
doing here?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.171
She's hostessing
until 11:00.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.770
Actually,
I better get going.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.568
I'll try to catch her
on the way home.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.642
See if she wants
to get a drink.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.929
If I know you, that's not
all she'll be getting.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
I'll see you later.

08:44.680 --> 08:45.966
I said no.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.008
No? Why not?

08:48.080 --> 08:50.367
I don't want to have a drink.
I want to go home.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.601
Is that so hard
to understand?

08:51.680 --> 08:53.569
Hey, hey, hey-

08:53.640 --> 08:55.961
What's goin' on?
Are you mad?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.964
No, I'm not mad.
I just...

08:59.040 --> 09:00.929
Go on, say it.
You know what?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.571
No matter what it is,
we're gonna work it out.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.969
Hal, I'm not
attracted to you.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.961
So what?
You think everyone who goes out

09:12.040 --> 09:13.644
is attracted to each other?
Get real.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.209
I think they're attracted to
each other in the beginning.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.966
Oh, come on. That sounds like
a bunch of New Age hooey.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.481
All right, maybe
for some people

09:24.560 --> 09:26.927
there's a little spark in the
beginning, but for most,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.686
the attraction part
happens way later.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.168
Just like that,
we're breaking up?

09:34.760 --> 09:38.367
Well, we were never going out.
We just had one date.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.641
Come on. Hey, let's stay together five days.
That's all I need.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.324
Why do you need
five days?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.971
Because tomorrow, I'll
finally get my promotion.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.806
There's gonna be parties, dinners, this, that.
Come on, I need you now.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.089
You don't need me.
You'll be so busy, you won't think about me.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.764
How can I not
think about you?

09:55.840 --> 09:57.285
You live right
across the hall.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.483
I don't know, Hal. Maybe...
Maybe you should think about moving.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.408
Hal, we've made a decision regarding
that wholesaler position.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.725
Yes! It's about
time, Dave.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.169
We decided to go with
the gal from Merrill.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.642
She's a proven entity.
A big producer.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.247
I'm sorry, man.

10:34.680 --> 10:40.164
No, it's... The gal's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?

10:43.560 --> 10:46.245
Hal, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, thanks.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.561
You should have gotten it.
You deserved it.

10:48.640 --> 10:52.008
No, I didn't. Obviously I
didn't put them in a position

10:52.080 --> 10:55.448
where they had to promote me.
It's a good lesson.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.285
Make yourself indispensable,
that's the key.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.967
And to make matters worse,
Jill dumped me last night.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.442
Dumped you? Don't you have to
be going out to get dumped?

11:05.560 --> 11:07.847
What does that mean?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.809
I just thought
it was more of a...

11:09.880 --> 11:11.769
Anyway, I don't see
why you care so much.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.490
You know she was
wrong for you.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.208
How can you say that?
She was perfect.

11:16.720 --> 11:20.281
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed molecules.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.931
By the way, her tits
weren't even real.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.129
Well, I could squeeze 'em.
That's real enough for me.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.770
Hal, I don't
understand how a guy

11:29.840 --> 11:35.609
who's as nice, and loyal, and generous
as you could have such a huge flaw.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.691
What are you talking about?

11:37.800 --> 11:42.727
You don't think picking girls solely on
their looks may not be the best way?

11:42.800 --> 11:46.168
What, am I supposed to apologize
for having high standards?

11:46.240 --> 11:48.811
High standards?
In the five years I've known you,

11:48.880 --> 11:51.611
every woman, I should say
girl, you've gone after

11:51.680 --> 11:53.011
has been completely
out of your league.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.651
What's that
supposed to mean?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.882
Oh, she doesn't
mean anything by it.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.884
She's just saying you're
not that good-looking.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.563
Oh! I thought she was implying
something really mean.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.608
No.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.128
Hey, it's you.
You're the TV guru guy.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.770
Tony Robbins.
Pleased to meet you.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.207
Yeah! Oh, man!

12:35.280 --> 12:38.489
So, wow! You gave advice
to whatchamacallit.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.126
President Clinton?
Mandela? No,no,no.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.281
Gorbachev?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.600
No, no. Pamela Anderson.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.605
Right? Yeah! Give me
another handshake.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.081
Man,
look at those mitts!

12:50.160 --> 12:52.242
That's like grabbing
a bunch of bananas.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.482
And what's up with those dogs?
How big are those?

12:54.560 --> 12:55.641
Size 16, buddy.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.006
Holy cannoli.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.401
You must do pretty
good with the ladies.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.720
Just one.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.444
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.244
She sounds hot!

13:07.720 --> 13:09.210
She is an amazing lady.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.645
I bet.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.404
So, what are you
doing in my town?

13:12.520 --> 13:14.409
We're doing
a seminar here.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.844
I help people deal with life's challenges
with more dignity and more courage.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.924
That's my deal, is the courage.
I try to...

13:22.000 --> 13:24.606
Hang on a second.
Are we gonna fall?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.808
No, it just stopped.
That's weird.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.241
Oh, man, yeah.
So what do we... Hang on.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.651
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.801
You Okay?

13:31.880 --> 13:34.884
Yeah, yeah. It's just,
I feel a little lightheaded.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.690
Then she dumped me.
Flat out.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.167
Not even the courtesy
of a severance pop.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.844
A severance pop?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.729
You know, one last...

13:49.920 --> 13:50.887
To ease the pain.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.930
The nice ones'll
sometimes throw you that.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.526
It sounds like you've had
some odd relationships.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.647
Yeah.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.121
See, the problem is
I'm kinda picky.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.850
What do you mean, picky?

14:01.920 --> 14:06.369
Well, for instance,
I like 'em real young.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.286
Like, did you ever see Paulina in her
first Sports <i>Illustrated</i> layout?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.328
You want a young
Paulina type?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.767
Well, that face, but
with better headlights.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.367
You know how hers have
kind of dimmed lately?

14:18.440 --> 14:21.046
Heidi Klum's beams would do.
And her teeth.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.442
Or that Britney Spears girl.
She's got great knockers.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.887
But she's a tad muscular.

14:26.960 --> 14:31.363
Actually, you know what?
Her ass would do, too, if she had a better grill.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.444
Like Michelle Pfeiffer
back when she did Grease 2.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.007
But she'd have to be a little
smilier than Michelle.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.084
Like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
before she got Stamosed.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.250
But not as skinny.
Someone a little meatier, like Heidi.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.567
But no accent.
You know those accents...

14:48.720 --> 14:49.721
They really get old fast.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.609
You know what I mean.
Someone like that.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.922
Don't you think you're being a bit
shallow in the way you look at women?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.331
Well, no.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.121
I mean, you know, I'd like her to
be into culture and shit, too.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.566
Okay, hypothetical situation.

15:06.640 --> 15:11.202
Which do you prefer, a girlfriend
missing one breast or half a brain?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.806
Toughie.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.046
That's a toughie.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.929
How's the remaining
breast? Is it big?

15:17.680 --> 15:19.808
What's your relationship
like with your parents?

15:19.880 --> 15:25.091
Oh, it's excellent. I mean, my mom's hilarious.
She golfs every afternoon.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.049
Actually, I don't
really remember my dad.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.407
He died when
I was nine, so...

15:29.480 --> 15:32.165
If you were nine, that's kind of odd.
You should remember a lot.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.163
Yeah, but I don't.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.211
My mom thinks I might have been a
little traumatized by the whole thing.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.887
Anyway, all I remember
is he was great.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.288
He was a great guy, and I
really loved him. But...

15:46.080 --> 15:47.809
I'm sorry you lost him.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.201
Hey, listen, I know
you got a great heart.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.601
You're just a bit fixated
on people's appearances.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.291
So, Hal Larson, I'm gonna
do you a great favor.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.771
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.320
Listen, this is how it'll work.
From this moment on,

15:59.400 --> 16:01.289
whenever you meet
someone in the future,

16:01.360 --> 16:03.761
you're only gonna see
what's inside them.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.490
So you'll respond
to that.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.689
Because that, my friend,
is where the true beauty lies.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.010
Okay, Tony, I think you're
getting a little cabin fever.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.845
Hold on.
What if I told you

16:14.920 --> 16:17.730
you could have the most
beautiful women in the world?

16:19.120 --> 16:21.327
Is this kind of like
what you do in your seminars?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.004
No, no,
this is very special.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.809
This is just
between you and me.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.607
Let's get up, and I'll
show you what to do. Yeah!

16:27.680 --> 16:31.605
Now, you got a pattern of looking at
women and judging them by the exterior.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.922
We gotta break that pattern.
All right.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.925
So has there been a time when
you were especially shallow?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.002
You saw a woman, thought you
were better than she was?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.684
- All the time.
- All the time.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.842
Can you think of a time
when you were really shallow?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.843
Oh, yeah, I got one.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.251
Think about that. Ready?

16:47.360 --> 16:49.567
Devils, come out!

16:49.640 --> 16:51.529
What the hell are you
doin', banana hands?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.090
Just hang on.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.685
We gotta jolt
your nervous system.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.205
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.886
Not just talk about it.
Here's what I want you to do.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.689
- Just relax.
- All right.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.046
And I won't
do that again.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.804
I didn't mean
the "banana hands" thing.

17:03.880 --> 17:04.881
That's okay.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.211
Close your eyes. Just relax.
And I want you to imagine that you're on a beach.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.001
It's a warm day, and the sun
is just starting to set.

17:14.079 --> 17:19.165
And you're looking in the eyes of a
woman, and you're feeling her heart.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.607
You're seeing her soul.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.241
You're feeling her spirit.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.163
That's it.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.005
That's it. Excellent.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.320
ExceHenL

17:39.720 --> 17:41.324
Taxi!

17:42.560 --> 17:43.561
Oh.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.931
I'm sorry. I...
I thought that...

17:48.000 --> 17:50.367
No,no,no.No. It's my fault.
I didn't see you.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.649
This is your cab.
No, I'm gonna get the next cab.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.168
Okay
All right

17:59.480 --> 18:04.088
Look, I'm just...
I'm just headed over to the East Side.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.885
Do you want to share, or...

18:06.960 --> 18:08.041
Yeah!

18:08.120 --> 18:10.009
Yeah, let's take this one.

18:10.080 --> 18:13.482
So, awesome.
Thank you. Terrific.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.926
Where to, my friends?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.604
East Side Plaza
for me, please.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.966
Likewise.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.120
What? Sorry. I just...

18:38.920 --> 18:42.891
I mean, yeah, you're...
You're really pretty.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.326
Yeah, right.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.210
Jeez, is everybody in
this city so flattering?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.646
See, I figured you weren't from around here.
Where you from?

18:53.720 --> 18:54.721
Boston.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.366
Beantown.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.889
The musical fruit.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.129
The more you eat,
the more you toot.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.081
So, you here on
a shoot or something?

19:09.160 --> 19:10.400
A shoot?

19:10.480 --> 19:12.562
I mean, you must be
a model, right?

19:21.760 --> 19:23.489
My grandmother's
not doing so well,

19:23.560 --> 19:26.211
so I took a year off
from school to help her out.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.170
Helping granny.
Cool.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.164
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.931
Bye.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.843
So, nice catching up.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.291
Listen,

19:56.080 --> 19:59.607
I know you'll probably think I'm some
kind of wacko for asking, but...

19:59.680 --> 20:00.966
What?

20:02.040 --> 20:05.408
Well, while you're here in
town, I mean, you know...

20:07.040 --> 20:11.364
If you ever feel like taking a break from
hanging out with your old, sick granny,

20:11.480 --> 20:12.845
you know, we could...

20:14.120 --> 20:15.451
Sure. I mean...

20:15.880 --> 20:17.006
Really?

20:17.080 --> 20:19.845
Are you kidding?
Yeah! That'd be...

20:19.920 --> 20:22.127
I would absolutely
love to, if...

20:22.240 --> 20:25.084
Okay, yeah. I should
get your number, then.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.726
No, no. I'll get yours,
because it would...

20:27.800 --> 20:29.848
With my luck,
you'll lose mine, so...

20:29.920 --> 20:32.605
Oh. No, I get it.
Very funny.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.206
You got me. That was...
No, that was good.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.851
You could've just said no,
but you went the extra mile.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.161
That was harsh.
I don't need this shit.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.810
Well, hey...

20:41.880 --> 20:43.166
What?

20:44.120 --> 20:47.124
I do want your number.
I'm sorry!

20:48.000 --> 20:49.889
I don't know what...
That was dumb.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.362
I was saying something...
I thought you meant... Never mind.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.482
Yes. Yes.

20:56.040 --> 21:00.090
Here's my phone number,
and here's my e-mail.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.491
E-mail. That's...

21:03.560 --> 21:05.289
Yeah. That's funny.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.769
<i>Hello?
</i> Hey, mudwhistle, get dressed.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.171
We're going out.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.563
So Robbins gave you free therapy
while you were in the elevator?

21:26.680 --> 21:29.206
Yeah. And then...
Check this out.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.410
He does this thing to me where he makes
it so I can score better with the ladies.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.648
At the time I thought
it was sort of a joke.

21:35.720 --> 21:39.645
But this afternoon, the first
beautiful woman I saw went for me.

21:39.720 --> 21:40.960
Could be coincidence.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.487
Butno. This wasn't, you know...
This was different.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.608
I don't know, she went
crazy for me or something.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.490
I think talking to him helped
my confidence or something.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.449
'Cause I do feel
more confident.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.764
Shit. Look who's here.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.721
What's the matter?
You have a problem with Walt?

22:02.840 --> 22:04.001
You don't?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.809
No. Why would I?

22:05.920 --> 22:09.003
Don't you get sick of it sometimes?
Sick of what?

22:09.920 --> 22:13.288
The whole I-walk-on-all-fours
-so-I-own-the-world thing.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.840
All the phony
self-deprecating crap.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.366
Jeez, the guy...
Give the guy a break!

22:18.480 --> 22:21.290
He's got spina bifida!
He plays the hand he was dealt.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.926
Yeah. And here he comes.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.761
There's a couple of
belt buckles I recognize.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.808
Hey, Walt.
How you doing?

22:31.880 --> 22:34.804
Do I look like I have
anything to complain about?

22:34.880 --> 22:37.486
Not if you don't mind
bunions on your knuckles.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.847
I gotta go to the can.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.200
Hey, man,
good to see ya.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.361
Good to see you.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.086
- How you been?
- Good.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.883
There's a pair of panties I recognize.
How ya doing, Deb?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.042
Okay, wise guy,
what's it gonna be?

22:51.120 --> 22:53.088
A bottle of Dom
for my buddy here.

22:53.160 --> 22:56.050
Another?
Okay, you got it.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.804
And keep 'em coming.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.330
What's the occasion?

23:00.440 --> 23:02.727
I take it you don't read
the business section?

23:02.800 --> 23:03.767
What did I miss?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.126
I sold my company
to Microsoft.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.611
Yeah? And
you cleaned up?

23:06.680 --> 23:09.923
Well, put it this way.
If I had an ass, I'd wipe it with twenties.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.890
All right!
Congratulations!

23:12.960 --> 23:15.361
Yup, I'm officially retired
and on the prowl.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.407
Hey, Walt.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.641
Hey, Sally.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.007
I got a leash.
Would you like to take me for a walk?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.289
Come on, boy.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.203
Catch ya later.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.847
Hi.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.887
Hi.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.566
Hal.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.845
I'm Bella.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.561
So, what's up?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.210
Nothing.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.606
My friends are all out
on the dance floor.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.761
Yeah?

23:48.840 --> 23:51.969
Oh, how come you're not out there
spanking the planks with 'em?

23:52.040 --> 23:54.281
Spanking the planks.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.283
So, are they
your roommates, or...

23:56.360 --> 23:59.125
No, we work together at the
Foundation Fighting Blindness.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.362
Oh, cool. I used
to know a deaf guy.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.169
Yeah.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.969
- Hey, do you wanna dance?
- Yes!

24:05.040 --> 24:06.485
All right.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.723
<i>Baby, when I saw you turning
at the end of the street</i>

24:31.400 --> 24:33.129
<i>I knew a time was gone</i>

24:33.240 --> 24:36.687
<i>And it took me like ages</i>

24:36.880 --> 24:41.886
<i>Just to understand that I was
afraid to be a simple guy</i>

24:42.440 --> 24:44.522
<i>I tried my best to smile</i>

24:44.920 --> 24:50.404
<i>But deep inside my heart I felt it
was shouting like a crowd dancing</i>

24:50.840 --> 24:54.128
<i>I guess I couldn't
live without the things</i>

24:54.200 --> 24:56.248
<i>That made my life
what it is</i>

24:56.920 --> 24:59.844
<i>Can't you hear me calling?</i>

25:00.320 --> 25:01.651
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

25:03.600 --> 25:06.968
<i>Everybody's dancing</i>

25:07.040 --> 25:08.849
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

25:10.120 --> 25:12.646
<i>Tonight everything
is over...</i>

25:12.720 --> 25:16.327
What in the name
of all that is holy?

25:16.440 --> 25:20.889
<i>I can't lie on my bed
without thinking I was wrong</i>

25:22.560 --> 25:25.211
<i>But when that
feeling calls...</i>

25:25.280 --> 25:26.645
Do you need help?

25:26.720 --> 25:28.882
What? Come on!

25:28.960 --> 25:32.442
<i>Nighttime won't hold me
in your arms again</i>

25:32.840 --> 25:35.764
<i>I got a very good
friend who says</i>

25:35.840 --> 25:40.687
<i>He can't believe the love
I give is not enough</i>

25:40.840 --> 25:44.925
<i>To end your fears I guess I
couldn't live without the things</i>

25:45.000 --> 25:47.048
<i>That made my life
what it is</i>

25:47.120 --> 25:48.246
Hal?

25:51.520 --> 25:54.046
It's 10:00.
We gotta go.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.530
What are
you talking about?

25:57.600 --> 26:00.001
Hal, we gotta go
do that thing.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.128
You know, at the place.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.850
What thing?

26:06.080 --> 26:07.730
Hey, sorry, ladies.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.928
I gotta steal your
dance partner here.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.570
No!

26:11.640 --> 26:12.721
What are you doing?

26:12.840 --> 26:13.966
I am rescuing you!

26:14.040 --> 26:15.246
From what?

26:15.320 --> 26:16.526
From what!

26:17.080 --> 26:21.130
<i>Oh, rainfalls and hard times coming,
they won't leave me tonight</i>

26:21.680 --> 26:24.604
From a pack of stampeding buffalo!
That's from what!

26:25.800 --> 26:30.761
<i>Just do let this spirit
survive Everybody's dancing</i>

26:30.840 --> 26:32.683
Come join us. I'm going
after the redhead.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.171
You can have your
pick of the other two.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.846
You mean you get the hyena, and I choose
between the hippo and the giraffe?

26:40.600 --> 26:43.729
Don't be intimidated, man.
They don't bite! Now, let's go!

26:43.800 --> 26:45.086
I'm getting back in there!

26:47.200 --> 26:49.806
Hey, go nuts.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.443
<i>Tonight everything is over</i>

26:55.520 --> 26:58.000
<i>I feel too young</i>

26:59.520 --> 27:01.522
Hey, Jill.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.522
<i>Everybody's shaking</i>

27:13.520 --> 27:15.807
Mauricio, it's Hal.
Pick it up.

27:15.880 --> 27:19.680
Look, man, I don't know what the hell
was the matter with you last night.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.161
First you wouldn't dance
with the hotties at the bar,

27:22.240 --> 27:25.005
then at the IHOP, those
hotties were even hotter,

27:25.120 --> 27:27.930
and you disappear!
Oh, my...

27:28.040 --> 27:31.203
I gotta call you back.
Something came up.

27:44.520 --> 27:48.844
<i>In the sky the birds
are pulling rain</i>

27:50.920 --> 27:55.084
<i>In your life a curse
has got a name</i>

27:57.920 --> 27:59.570
Building a parachute?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.327
Excuse me?

28:03.040 --> 28:04.849
They're a little big,
aren't they?

28:06.440 --> 28:11.401
Oh, I get it. You ripped the
spinnaker on your sailboat, right?

28:17.600 --> 28:18.681
I'm sorry. I just...

28:18.800 --> 28:23.169
It seemed so funny seeing someone like
you holding up a pair of old-lady trou.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.208
Someone like me?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.726
Yeah. You know,
someone so fit.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.089
You are a jackass.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.041
Miss, please. I'm sorry.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.122
I didn't mean to offend you.

28:38.200 --> 28:43.047
Hey, unibrow, why don't you double
your dosage and leave me alone?

28:43.120 --> 28:45.248
Let's start over.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.244
Look, that was
really dumb of me.

28:48.320 --> 28:52.245
You were probably buying 'em for someone
close to you, right? And I insulted them.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.970
Well, however it is
you took it,

28:54.040 --> 28:55.804
I want you to know I didn't
mean to piss you off.

28:55.920 --> 28:59.208
I wanted to meet you,
and I guess...

29:00.680 --> 29:02.842
I guess I'm not real
smooth sometimes.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.891
Let me make it up to you.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.930
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything all right?

29:20.120 --> 29:24.762
So, what do you do
for a living, Rosemary?

29:24.840 --> 29:27.969
I'm actually volunteering
at the hospital right now,

29:28.040 --> 29:32.887
'cause I'm waiting for this
re-up thing to come through.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.209
Re-up? What,
are you in the army?

29:37.760 --> 29:39.364
Peace Corps.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.680
Peace Corps.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.411
That's very altrudocious
of you.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.801
Altrudocious?
That's not a word.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.682
You mean
humanidocious, right?

29:52.440 --> 29:53.646
Yeah. That's the one.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.371
All right.
Ready to order?

29:56.480 --> 30:01.805
Yeah. Can I get
a double pizza burger,

30:01.880 --> 30:05.726
chili fries with cheese, and
a large chocolate milkshake?

30:07.560 --> 30:12.202
Nicely done. I'll have
the exact same thing.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.850
You got it.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.369
I am impressed.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.568
It's nice to see a girl
order a real meal.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.689
I can't stand it when you guys order
a glass of water and a crouton.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.489
It ruins the whole
point of going out.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.167
Yeah, well, that's probably what
I should be ordering, you know?

30:27.240 --> 30:30.449
But I don't know,
no matter what I eat,

30:30.520 --> 30:32.409
my weight just seems
to stay the same.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.006
So I just figure, what the hell?
I'm gonna eat what I want.

30:35.080 --> 30:38.289
Oh, totally. If you can get
away with it, more power to ya.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.244
Don't be a smart-ass.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.048
What?
No, I'm just saying, you know.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.567
I feel bad for people who count calories.
It's no way to live.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.844
Yeah.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.810
But in return they get to
be a lot thinner than I am.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.565
Are you out of your mind?

31:00.640 --> 31:03.246
What do you weigh?
110,115 pounds?

31:05.640 --> 31:08.644
Which one of my butt cheeks
are you talking about?

31:09.800 --> 31:11.211
Okay.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.204
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.567
Trust me, whatever you're
doing, it's working.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.880
It is working.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.530
Oh, go on.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.206
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

31:23.960 --> 31:25.166
Oops.

31:26.280 --> 31:30.205
Goddang it. Rosemary, don't move.
Is your back all right?

31:30.280 --> 31:31.281
Yeah.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.771
Is she all right?

31:32.840 --> 31:35.366
Listen, you gotta get some
decent chairs in here, man.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.444
What's this shit
made out of, anyway?

31:38.520 --> 31:40.807
Steel.

31:40.880 --> 31:46.171
Yeah? Well, you should get it
welded better in the corners!

31:46.640 --> 31:47.721
All right, then.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.410
Rosemary, you sure
you're okay?

31:49.480 --> 31:53.121
Yeah. I'm a little
embarrassed but

31:53.200 --> 31:55.043
it's happened before,
it'll happen again.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.360
Oh, man.

31:58.800 --> 32:02.247
Don't be embarrassed. Listen, I beef it.
Everybody beefs it.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.369
We're too late.
The food's probably all gone.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.569
Listen, can you wait
here one second?

32:12.640 --> 32:15.041
Oh, Hal,
just let it go.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.322
Nah. Nah.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.687
- Hal.
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.524
You guys are making fun of me
'cause I'm a little pudgy?

32:27.280 --> 32:29.681
No, I wasn't making fun of you.
I was... That's fine.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.643
Do me a favor.
Take a look outside.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.282
You see that little
fox out there?

32:34.360 --> 32:37.204
See that little number?
She's with me.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.284
If you took all the women you
two have ever gone out with,

32:40.360 --> 32:42.203
they wouldn't
equal one of her.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.043
- We're not arguing that.
- No.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.962
That's right.
Laugh it up, fellas.

32:50.040 --> 32:54.762
And tonight, when you're hugging
your pillow, remember, I'm with her.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.047
All right? That's it.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.844
What happened?
Well, let's just say

33:03.960 --> 33:07.248
the score's Hal two,
mall rats zero.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.721
Let me walk you to your car.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.640
Well, thanks for lunch, Hal.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.730
My pleasure, Rosie.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.404
My mother calls me Rosie.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.482
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:20.600 --> 33:25.003
Gentlemen, can I interest you in
some chili fries and half a burger?

33:25.080 --> 33:29.005
There's a lot left 'cause the little
guy couldn't finish his meal.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.321
- Hey.Hey.
- Pussy.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.567
That was nice of you.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.881
Well, you're all right
in my book, too, Hal.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.371
Can I have your number?

33:38.440 --> 33:39.680
What number?

33:39.760 --> 33:42.206
Your PIN number,
I want your money!

33:42.280 --> 33:45.204
Your phone number.
What do you think?

33:45.280 --> 33:46.441
VVhy?

33:47.760 --> 33:51.003
You know, to go out.
Maybe like tomorrow.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.604
Well, yeah

34:02.720 --> 34:07.044
I mean, sure. It's in the
book under Rosemary Shanahan.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.690
I can write it down.
It's S-H-A...

34:08.760 --> 34:10.444
No, I'll remember it.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.726
My boss's name
is Steve Shanahan.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.040
That's my father's name.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.690
Not JPS Steve Shanahan?

34:16.760 --> 34:18.683
Yeah!

34:18.760 --> 34:19.806
Yeah.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.484
Your father is my boss.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.130
I mean, not my boss.
He's my boss's boss.

34:24.199 --> 34:27.841
I mean, I don't know him, but
I see him around the office.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.204
Well, then you won't
forget my name.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.969
- Hal?
- Yeah?

34:50.400 --> 34:52.527
If I don't hear from you,

34:53.639 --> 34:55.768
I appreciate everything,
anyway.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.325
Cuckoo.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.762
You sure you don't
want a dog?

35:07.840 --> 35:11.287
Yeah, yeah.
I'm trying to lose a couple of lbs.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.124
Since when do you
care about your gut?

35:13.200 --> 35:17.285
I don't really, but
I'm a little nervous.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.046
This girl who's coming to meet
me here is in incredible.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.282
Like the ones on the dance
floor the other night?

35:24.360 --> 35:28.684
Even better, buddy.
I'm telling you, it's almost beyond belief.

35:28.760 --> 35:33.971
She's funny, she's smart, she
teaches self-esteem to sick kids.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.008
And I would never believe a
girl as beautiful could have

35:36.080 --> 35:38.082
such a great personality.

35:38.160 --> 35:42.324
Ugly duckling syndrome.
She probably wasn't pretty till high school.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.802
The personality had to
develop out of necessity.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.644
You know what?
I bet you're right.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.041
She's way too pretty
to be so nice.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.531
Sometimes they're
ugly so long,

35:51.600 --> 35:53.807
they turn pretty
and don't realize it.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.925
The ugly self-image is so well ingrained.
That's a real find.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.684
- Hey!
- Hey!

36:00.560 --> 36:01.800
I've been looking for you.

36:02.880 --> 36:06.327
Oh, shit. Oh, it's Lindy.
The girl with the toe.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.242
Hey, Mauricio.
How ya doing?

36:09.320 --> 36:11.402
Good. Did you
get my message?

36:12.560 --> 36:16.929
No, no. My phone machine's not
really working there. Did you call?

36:17.000 --> 36:20.243
I got tickets for
that Beatles reunion.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.367
The Beatles?

36:21.440 --> 36:23.488
Yeah. Well, not
the real Beatles,

36:23.560 --> 36:25.449
but Paul, George and
Ringo will be there.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.682
But Eric Clapton is
filling in for John.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.163
It's an invitation-only
acoustic set.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.083
Only about 70 people, tops.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.207
Oh, man.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.441
So you're in?

36:40.000 --> 36:42.287
No. Not a Clapton fan.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.010
Think I'll pass.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.486
Okay.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.848
Well, I guess I'll see ya.
Yeah, yeah.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.570
Bye, Lindy.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.927
Oh, did you
see the toe?

36:56.000 --> 36:59.561
Mauricio, I gotta tell
you, you got issues.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.721
Don't even get me started.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.770
Oh, God. There she is.
There's Rosemary.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.366
Where?

37:07.440 --> 37:09.090
Right there.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.127
Right where?

37:10.200 --> 37:12.248
Straight ahead.
Across the field.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.641
Is she behind the rhino?

37:14.720 --> 37:16.722
She's right there!

37:22.960 --> 37:25.884
Mauricio, I want you
to meet someone.

37:25.960 --> 37:30.010
This is Rosemary Shanahan.
Rosemary, Mauricio Wilson.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.651
Hi. Nice to meet you.

37:32.720 --> 37:36.884
Holy cow. I mean, hi.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.081
Is that a Members Only
jacket?

37:42.360 --> 37:43.850
Yes. Yes, it is.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.968
So, are you, like,
the last member?

37:48.720 --> 37:52.406
Oh, man. One-nothing, Rosemary.
I told you she was good.

37:52.480 --> 37:57.088
Excuse me forjust one second.
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.526
Yeah, hold on.
Will you guys excuse me?

38:00.600 --> 38:02.523
Want something
from the snack bar?

38:02.600 --> 38:05.968
Yeah, get me a beer and nachos
with all the stuff on it.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.405
You got it.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.290
Does she take
the cake or what?

38:11.360 --> 38:13.886
She takes
the whole bakery, Hal.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.007
I told you.

38:15.080 --> 38:18.209
Yes, you did. And yet
I wasn't prepared.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.410
So, what are you up for?

38:21.480 --> 38:23.926
I don't know.
I like the track.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.002
So she's a gambler.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.447
Yeah, well, just the dogs.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.002
I hate the ponies. There's too
much human involvement, you know?

38:34.040 --> 38:37.681
You can't trust people if
you're looking for a fair deal.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.440
What about you?
Do you gamble?

38:41.520 --> 38:43.045
No, not really.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.771
I mean, I bet on pro
football now and then,

38:45.840 --> 38:48.605
but to make it more exciting.
I don't care if I win.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.720
I've never read that book.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.165
What book?

38:54.240 --> 38:55.765
<i>Things Losers Say.</i>

38:59.080 --> 39:01.447
Hey, I got a good idea.
Why don't we forget the track,

39:01.520 --> 39:04.524
and I'll introduce you to
some good friends of mine?

39:04.600 --> 39:06.170
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.169
- All right.
- What do you say?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.566
I say okay.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.880
You say okay?

39:14.240 --> 39:18.564
Hi, guys. I want you to meet a
very good friend of mine. Okay?

39:18.640 --> 39:23.043
This guy here is Hal.
And he's really funny.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.886
- How ya doing?
- Good.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.564
Good to meet ya.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.445
Hey.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.521
Oh, my God.
Look at that face.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.688
She should be doing
Keebler commercials.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.884
You're the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.610
What's your name,
beautiful?

39:39.680 --> 39:40.681
Cadence.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.888
Cadence.
That's a pretty name.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.803
You know, my uncle's
name is Cadence.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.046
Well, I got news
for you, Cadence.

39:51.600 --> 39:55.571
I'm not putting you down
until the cows come home.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.688
Put her down.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.843
The cow came home.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.769
What is he doing here?

40:02.840 --> 40:04.808
These aren't visiting hours.

40:04.920 --> 40:08.925
Oh, Nurse Peeler, we were just
coming by to say hi to the kids.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.606
Oh, fine.
Pack it up.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.482
And get these patients
back in their beds.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.806
Should we get going?

40:21.880 --> 40:25.487
Don't pay any attention
to Nurse Sourpuss.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.005
Sourpuss.

40:29.640 --> 40:33.247
Heyllgotanidea.
Do you want to play the kissing game?

40:33.320 --> 40:35.402
Me! Idol

40:35.520 --> 40:37.522
Yeah?
Want me to go get a bottle?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.171
No, no. Want to
get the lipstick?

40:40.240 --> 40:41.287
Get lipstick.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.044
Yeah, okay.

40:43.120 --> 40:46.522
What we do is
we put on the lipstick.

40:47.320 --> 40:51.962
The kisser kisses as much as they
can until the lipstick comes off.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.611
Oh, cool.
I want to go first.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.529
Then I'm going last.

40:56.640 --> 40:57.687
Jesse.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.444
Hey,
they don't have

40:59.560 --> 41:01.608
anything I can catch,
do they?

41:01.680 --> 41:03.762
They don't have
anything you can catch.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.605
I didn't think so.
You guys don't even look sick.

41:06.680 --> 41:09.684
You're just a bunch of phonies
like my Uncle Cadence.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.366
I'll bet you're here so you
can get out of school. Right?

41:12.440 --> 41:14.329
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.401
Give me some lipstick.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.481
Put on lipstick.

41:17.520 --> 41:21.366
You were incredible in there.
You were. You were so amazing.

41:21.440 --> 41:25.331
I'm serious. A lot of people get squeamish
in that situation, and you were so...

41:25.400 --> 41:27.004
Rosemary? Is that you?

41:27.080 --> 41:29.082
Dr. Sayed!
How's it going?

41:29.160 --> 41:30.207
Good. Who is this?

41:30.280 --> 41:31.361
This is my friend Hal.

41:31.440 --> 41:32.771
Hal.
Good to meet you.

41:32.880 --> 41:36.009
Be nice to her.
She's a good girl. All right.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.003
- Bye, Rosemary.
- Bye.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.082
I'm serious. That's what
these kids need,

41:40.160 --> 41:44.165
is, like, a stranger who isn't afraid to
just be with them and play with them.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.368
It builds their
self-confidence.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.562
Why would anybody
be afraid of 'em?

41:49.720 --> 41:53.042
You are off-the-charts adorable.
Do you know that?

41:53.120 --> 41:54.451
Come on.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.851
This is a nice
street you live on.

41:58.920 --> 42:01.924
Yeah, this is my street.
You want to come up?

42:02.040 --> 42:05.965
Yeah. But I don't
think I should.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.611
Why not?
It's only 9:00.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.728
I know. I don't
think it's a good idea.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.690
Oh, no. Did I do something? No.

42:14.960 --> 42:18.009
You've been really cool.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.081
Hi, Hal.

42:19.160 --> 42:22.448
Oh, hey, Jill.
Rosemary, this is my neighbor Jill.

42:22.560 --> 42:23.561
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.051
Nice...

42:26.800 --> 42:28.040
Sorry.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.326
Nice to meet you.

42:29.440 --> 42:32.091
Nice to meet you,
too, Jill.

42:32.160 --> 42:36.722
I gotta go meet some friends,
so I'll see you guys later.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.529
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.931
Come up.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.888
No.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.567
What? I thought... I thought
we were having a good time.

42:46.640 --> 42:50.087
We were. It's just, you know,
Hal, I'm not used to all this.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.650
Used to what?

42:52.840 --> 42:55.081
Hal, you've been
really nice to me today.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.969
I really appreciate it.
But...

42:57.040 --> 42:59.771
What, your other boyfriends
aren't nice to you?

42:59.840 --> 43:02.161
I don't have
other boyfriends.

43:02.240 --> 43:03.321
Bullshit.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.168
Well, I had one boyfriend.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.251
It was kind of recently, actually,
but it didn't work out.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.362
You've been
burnt?

43:16.840 --> 43:19.764
No. That's just it.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.811
I... I've never been close
enough to anybody to get burnt.

43:23.880 --> 43:27.441
Please! With a mug
like that?

43:27.520 --> 43:29.090
You must be fighting
'em off daily.

43:29.520 --> 43:33.605
Right! I mean, I saw the way your
friend Mauricio looked at me.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.921
I thought he was gonna shoot
me with a tranquilizer gun

43:36.000 --> 43:37.240
and tag my ear.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.926
Don't worry.
He's been acting really weird lately.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.446
Especially around
really pretty girls.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.366
Hal,

43:46.400 --> 43:50.371
do me a favor and stop saying that I'm
pretty, and that I'm not fat, okay?

43:50.480 --> 43:53.450
'Cause it makes me
uncomfortable.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.568
Okay. You have a problem
with compliments?

43:58.200 --> 44:02.000
Look. I know what I am
and I know what I'm not.

44:03.440 --> 44:08.162
I'm the girl who gets really good
grades and isn't afraid to be funny.

44:08.240 --> 44:12.802
And I'm the girl who has a lot of friends
who are boys, and no boyfriends.

44:12.920 --> 44:16.481
I'm not beautiful, okay?
And I never will be.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.484
And I'm fine with that.
You know?

44:20.240 --> 44:24.325
But when you go around saying
that I'm something that I'm not,

44:24.400 --> 44:26.607
it's just,
it's not nice.

44:26.680 --> 44:30.571
Rosemary.
You're starting to scare me.

44:31.240 --> 44:32.685
I mean,
I really like you,

44:32.760 --> 44:38.369
but I have to assume you're a little nutty
if you really believe you're not beautiful.

44:38.440 --> 44:39.680
Grow up, Hal.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.005
Rosie. Wait a second.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.766
Well, it was too
good to be true.

44:56.520 --> 45:00.206
Rosemary. Turned out
to be a total psycho.

45:01.600 --> 45:04.490
Her self-image is
so far off, it's scary.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.763
Well, maybe you had a little
something to do with that.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.604
What? What are you
talking about?

45:10.680 --> 45:14.082
All I ever did was tell her
how perfect she was.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.288
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.687
Then she got all huffy
and told me to grow up.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.488
Well, that's probably good advice.
You are kind of immature.

45:24.080 --> 45:27.926
You're not serious. You actually
think you're more mature than me?

45:28.000 --> 45:32.210
Yeah, right. I'm probably
more immature than you,

45:32.280 --> 45:35.011
but at least I have
a bigger willie.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.287
Yeah, bigger
than a mouse's.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.561
What the hell was that?

45:48.680 --> 45:50.364
I said your willie's
bigger than...

45:50.440 --> 45:51.441
I heard,

45:51.560 --> 45:53.801
but it took you,
like, eight seconds.

45:53.880 --> 45:56.087
You can't make a comeback
after eight seconds.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.482
You got three seconds.
Five, tops.

45:59.560 --> 46:03.042
That's why they call it
a quip. Not a slowp.

46:04.520 --> 46:09.003
All right, you got anything better to read?
I gotta fire off a missile.

46:20.480 --> 46:23.529
Hi. Is this
a bad time, or...

46:24.320 --> 46:25.401
No.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.451
I just wanted to apologize
for last night.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.443
You don't have
to apologize.

46:33.800 --> 46:34.961
Yeah, I do.

46:35.040 --> 46:38.487
I called you, like, immature or
sophomoric or something like that.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.927
- I know you're not...
- My God. Hal!

46:41.000 --> 46:43.810
You gotta get in here
and look at this turd.

46:43.880 --> 46:46.406
It looks just like
Klinger from M*A*S*H.

46:50.760 --> 46:53.286
Why don't we get out of here?
Okay.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.805
Coffee?

47:05.160 --> 47:07.003
Excuse me. Are you
ready to order?

47:07.080 --> 47:09.686
Yes. Two double cheeseburgers,
bacon, one with relish.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.489
Thank you.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.121
Are you okay?

47:18.200 --> 47:19.440
Brain freeze.

47:19.760 --> 47:24.721
<i>Baby, now that I've found
you I can't let you go</i>

47:25.000 --> 47:29.289
<i>I'll build my world around
you, I need you so</i>

47:31.280 --> 47:33.521
Excuse me, sweetie.
Professional.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.602
<i>Baby, baby,
since first we met...</i>

47:42.680 --> 47:44.842
Hey, Billy, stay over
near the ladder.

47:45.640 --> 47:48.769
Weak. So weak.

47:48.840 --> 47:51.730
You wanna see a splash?
I'm gonna show you a splash. Ready?

47:56.360 --> 47:59.842
<i>You spend a lifetime
looking for somebody</i>

48:00.480 --> 48:03.006
<i>To give me love like you</i>

48:04.480 --> 48:07.882
<i>Now you've told me
that you wanna leave me</i>

48:07.960 --> 48:11.931
<i>Darling, I just
can't let you</i>

48:12.000 --> 48:16.722
<i>Baby, now that I've found
you I can't let you</i> go...

48:16.800 --> 48:18.484
That was good?

48:18.560 --> 48:19.721
Billy?

48:20.160 --> 48:23.243
Billy? Billy? Billy!

48:24.160 --> 48:25.650
Daddy.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.161
Sorry.

48:30.640 --> 48:33.689
<i>Now that I've found you
I can't let you go</i>

48:33.760 --> 48:37.845
<i>I'll build my world around
you, I need you so</i>

48:38.040 --> 48:41.681
<i>Baby, even though
you don't need</i> me

48:41.760 --> 48:44.570
You don't need me

48:46.480 --> 48:47.720
What's the matter?

48:47.800 --> 48:50.451
I should have
changed at the beach.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.444
What? Are you crazy?
You look great.

48:53.520 --> 48:56.330
I don't normally dress like
this around my parents.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.890
Hey, hey, come on.

48:57.960 --> 49:01.203
I'm the one who should be
nervous here, not you.

49:03.320 --> 49:08.201
Hey, you know, I've been meaning
to ask you, were you adopted?

49:09.200 --> 49:10.770
No. Why?

49:11.480 --> 49:13.926
'Cause your dad
has that weird accent.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.970
And also, I've seen him
around the office.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.122
I gotta say, I don't see
the slightest resemblance.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.361
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.603
Everybody says if you put a wig
on him, he'd look just like me.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.682
Would you
look at who's here now?

49:27.760 --> 49:29.046
Come here, my darlin'.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.610
Hi, Daddy.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.167
Rosie, honey.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.520
Mom.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.648
Good to see ya.

49:35.720 --> 49:38.485
Hal Larson, the guy
I was telling you about.

49:38.560 --> 49:39.971
It's great to
meet you, sir.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.684
Likewise.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.091
Nice to meet you, Hal.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.242
The pleasure is mine,
Mrs. Shanahan.

49:46.480 --> 49:49.086
I can see where
Rosemary gets her figure.

49:56.720 --> 50:00.441
What the hell...
What the hell is that you've got on?

50:02.600 --> 50:04.489
We were at the beach.

50:04.560 --> 50:07.723
Won't you be putting
something else on, darlin'?

50:08.720 --> 50:12.805
Oh, come on. She doesn't have to do that for me.
Let's just keep it casual.

50:13.560 --> 50:15.085
Casual.

50:16.840 --> 50:21.368
Hey, Dad, Hal's one of your great
untapped resources down at the company.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.681
Why don't you tell him
some of your ideas?

50:23.760 --> 50:26.764
Oh, so you've got
a few ideas, do ya?

50:27.640 --> 50:29.768
It is risky, but
the rewards are greater, too.

50:29.880 --> 50:33.851
The point is, only a company
with a solid reputation like JPS

50:33.920 --> 50:35.570
could ever market
this product.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.166
Hal, let me take your plate.

50:40.240 --> 50:42.561
Oh, thank you.
It was delicious.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.722
Can I get you boys
some coffee?

50:44.800 --> 50:47.167
I'd love a cup
of tea, darlin'.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.402
Maybe just a drop
of the hard stuff.

50:50.520 --> 50:54.206
Yeah, I'll just have a cup ofjoe.
That'd be great. Thanks.

50:55.560 --> 50:59.770
I have to say, Hal, I'm impressed
with a lot of your ideas.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.968
Some of them are
dog shit, you know,

51:02.040 --> 51:05.283
but for the most part, you seem
to have done your homework.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.727
So I'd like you to do
something for me. Okay.

51:07.800 --> 51:12.010
Well, I'm meeting with me executive
committee Monday morning,

51:12.080 --> 51:14.447
and I'd like you to
make a presentation.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.045
Seriously?

51:17.120 --> 51:19.248
Well, nothing fancy,
you understand.

51:19.320 --> 51:23.041
Just talk about the same things
that you talked about here tonight.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.610
Great. I'd love to.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.042
Oh, and by the way,

51:28.080 --> 51:30.162
you can cut out
the act now.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.241
Excuse me?

51:31.320 --> 51:35.405
You think I got as far as I did
in me life by bein' a fool?

51:36.320 --> 51:39.244
Now, you've got ambition,
Hal, and I admire that.

51:39.320 --> 51:42.449
Hell, I wish I had a hundred
more like yourself.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.488
We'd be the number-one firm
in the country.

51:44.560 --> 51:47.370
And me daughter would get
a hell of a lot more dates.

51:49.120 --> 51:52.169
I'm sure Rosemary doesn't have
any problem getting dates.

51:52.240 --> 51:55.210
I told you to cut
the shit out, all right?

51:55.280 --> 51:58.090
Look, Rosemary
is me daughter,

51:58.160 --> 52:00.288
and God knows
I love her dearly.

52:01.520 --> 52:06.287
But I think we both know that we won't
soon be seeing her twirlin' the baton,

52:06.360 --> 52:08.966
marching along with the
Dallas Cheerleaders.

52:16.880 --> 52:18.723
I don't understand.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.644
I'm telling you
the truth, Hal.

52:23.160 --> 52:27.290
And the truth is I haven't been able
to bounce me daughter on me knee

52:27.360 --> 52:29.362
since she was two.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.289
You know, I've read
about people like you.

52:34.960 --> 52:36.166
People like me?

52:36.240 --> 52:39.323
You superachievers with
your impossible standards.

52:39.400 --> 52:42.483
Nothing's ever good enough.
Nothing measures up.

52:42.560 --> 52:47.168
It never occurs to you that your kids
are people, with their own feelings.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.651
You think they're just
an extension of you,

52:48.720 --> 52:50.529
like your billion-dollar
company,

52:50.600 --> 52:54.889
or your $20 million Lear Jet and
your Picasso out in the front hall.

52:54.960 --> 52:59.284
Everything reflects on you, so nothing
and no one is ever good enough.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.251
Go on.

53:02.560 --> 53:05.006
When I first met Rosemary,

53:05.080 --> 53:07.651
she told me she knew
she wasn't that good-looking.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.609
I could not
believe my ears.

53:10.040 --> 53:12.327
How can a person
this beautiful

53:12.400 --> 53:17.531
possibly interpret what she sees in the
mirror to be anything other than that?

53:17.600 --> 53:19.568
Well, now I know.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.040
Is everything okay?

53:27.960 --> 53:30.611
Yeah,
everything is fine.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.170
Just fine.

53:40.640 --> 53:41.971
What?

53:43.560 --> 53:48.009
Nothing. I just can't
believe how lucky I am.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.568
You swear to God
you're not gonna laugh?

53:58.720 --> 54:00.404
Come on,
I'm not gonna laugh.

54:10.800 --> 54:12.325
Daddy like.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.971
<i>The look on your face</i>

54:18.400 --> 54:23.440
<i>It can never
explain your heart</i>

54:24.000 --> 54:29.006
<i>And the touch of my lips</i>

54:29.840 --> 54:35.483
<i>It can never
tell you my thoughts</i>

54:35.560 --> 54:39.963
<i>Then you want me to change</i>

54:41.480 --> 54:44.927
<i>I can't get used</i> to...

54:45.800 --> 54:47.723
What in...
How did...

54:53.360 --> 54:55.727
Get over here, Houdini.

54:56.400 --> 55:00.803
<i>'Cause it's not really me
This is my world</i>

55:00.880 --> 55:05.329
<i>This is who I am
And I'm not gonna give</i> up...

55:05.400 --> 55:07.323
Hi.

55:07.400 --> 55:09.562
Yes, I am.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.486
Everything's so perfect.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.369
It's a little scary.

55:16.440 --> 55:17.601
I know.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.002
But in a good way.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.050
To have so much to lose.
That's nice.

55:34.960 --> 55:36.086
I'm gonna call you later.

55:36.160 --> 55:37.650
Okay.

55:37.720 --> 55:39.290
Bye.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.690
Forget something?

55:57.040 --> 55:59.042
Oh, hey.
Hi. I'm glad I caught you

55:59.120 --> 56:01.521
before you went to work.
What's up?

56:01.600 --> 56:04.570
I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to come over tonight.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.120
Open a bottle of wine,
maybe watch a video.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.370
Nah. Thanks, though.

56:16.400 --> 56:19.006
And in summation,
I feel that these measures

56:19.080 --> 56:21.845
will help JPS and
all of our customers.

56:28.880 --> 56:30.962
- Nice job, Hal.
- Thank you.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.405
- Nicely done.
- I appreciate it.

56:33.480 --> 56:35.164
Hal, I stand corrected.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.890
Thank you.

56:36.960 --> 56:40.521
Hal, I need to see you
in me office straight away.

56:40.600 --> 56:42.011
Sure.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.929
Sit yourself down.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.328
So, what'd you think?

56:50.880 --> 56:53.724
I'll be gettin' to
that in a minute.

56:53.800 --> 56:57.361
I want to talk to you about that little
conversation we had the other night

56:57.440 --> 57:00.284
and all of them things
you said to me.

57:01.160 --> 57:05.529
Well, I'm more than just a little
embarrassed, having said what I said.

57:06.520 --> 57:09.251
I think me daughter
is lucky to have you.

57:10.040 --> 57:13.044
No, sir.
I'm the lucky one.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.524
Indeed.

57:15.600 --> 57:19.730
Well, now, as to
your meeting in there.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.529
Sure, it was first-rate.

57:21.880 --> 57:24.008
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes.

57:24.080 --> 57:27.129
Hal, I'm gonna
level with ya.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.725
I need your balls.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.247
Sir?

57:30.320 --> 57:34.041
I need a man around that can give
it to me straight, you know?

57:34.120 --> 57:37.727
Whether the news
be good or bad.

57:37.800 --> 57:39.643
So I've decided.

57:39.720 --> 57:43.566
From now on, you'll be
working directly for me.

57:46.720 --> 57:49.007
I don't know
what to say but...

57:50.400 --> 57:51.447
Thank you.

57:51.520 --> 57:55.127
Well, a thank you
will do just fine.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.321
Well, get the fuck out.

58:01.400 --> 58:02.447
Oh, okay.

58:09.120 --> 58:12.329
Congratulations
on your promotion!

58:12.400 --> 58:13.401
Oh, sorry.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.450
No, no. Come in, come in.
I want you to meet Rosemary.

58:16.520 --> 58:18.648
Rosemary, this is Jen and Artie.
Hi.

58:18.720 --> 58:21.451
Kids, Rosemary Shanahan.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.449
As in Steve?

58:23.560 --> 58:28.202
Yeah, he's my dad. Oh, God, which
reminds me, I gotta meet him for lunch.

58:28.280 --> 58:30.851
I'll see you this
weekend, okay?

58:34.360 --> 58:36.010
It was really nice
to meet you guys.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.570
Mind if I take
a little sliver?

58:37.640 --> 58:39.085
Go for it.

58:45.440 --> 58:47.283
Beauty.

58:47.360 --> 58:49.169
Want a plate?

58:51.840 --> 58:54.923
I know what you're thinking.
Where does she put it, right?

58:55.640 --> 58:59.850
You guys, thanks for the cake.
You didn't have to do this.

58:59.920 --> 59:01.729
Hey, it was the least
we could do,

59:01.800 --> 59:03.609
seeing as how you worked
so hard to become

59:03.680 --> 59:05.967
"indispensable"
to the company.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.210
Is that that new thing
called sarcasm?

59:10.280 --> 59:14.126
Hal, we all know you're
about as deep as a puddle.

59:14.200 --> 59:16.885
In fact, that used to be
part of your charm.

59:16.960 --> 59:19.486
But this just
flat out sucks.

59:19.560 --> 59:20.561
What are you
talking about?

59:20.640 --> 59:25.726
If you have one ounce of integrity
left, you'll break it off immediately,

59:25.800 --> 59:28.087
before you hurt
the poor girl.

59:36.600 --> 59:41.242
I gotta give you credit for being more
proactive and starting to meet women

59:41.320 --> 59:43.641
and who knows? Maybe you are
on a roll here or something.

59:43.720 --> 59:47.008
But don't you think it's time
to raise the bar a little?

59:47.440 --> 59:50.683
I mean, at first I thought you
were in a slump, you know?

59:50.760 --> 59:53.240
I could, as a friend,
look the other way

59:53.360 --> 59:55.681
while you banged a few fatties
and got it out of your system.

59:55.760 --> 59:58.081
But there's lots of
good-eatin' fish out there.

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.481
You don't have to snack
on carp any more.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.643
I suppose the girls we partied
with a couple weeks ago downtown

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.449
were a couple of carp, too?

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.090
No. Laura, the one
with the whiskers,

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.367
she looked more
like a catfish.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.046
Oh, I see.
And what about Marie?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.011
Pop some bolts on her neck,

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.128
and the villagers
will be chasing her.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.168
- And Vicki?
- Who?

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.651
- Vicki!
- Who's Vicki?

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.809
Vicki Vicki.
With the short brown hair.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.248
Vicki? I thought that was a guy.
I was calling her Vic!

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.846
Oh, you're out
of your mind!

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.287
Look, I know I'm being
a little harsh on you here.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.921
I think real friends are obligated
to be honest with each other.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.401
This one that you're dating now...
Jeez.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.645
Careful.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.770
Hey, all I'm saying is she's
got cankles, for God's sake.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.887
What?

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.325
Canklesl
She's got no ankles.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.165
The calf merged with the foot,
cut out the middleman.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.480
She has coffee cans.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.766
I know what cankles are.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.649
Rosemary doesn't have 'em.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.724
You know what?
I know what you're doing here.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.324
You're scared.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.447
Scared?

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.844
Yup. This is exactly what you did with
the knockout with the weird frinkly toe.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.209
You're inventing reasons to dump
girls 'cause you're afraid.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.443
All right, look. I admit Rosemary
is kind of cool, all right?

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.524
But admit you wouldn't
talk to that woolly mammoth

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.728
if her father wasn't
company president.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.441
What?

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.690
I guarantee you've never met anyone
like this guy who's coming with us.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.886
You're gonna love him.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.325
Great.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.640
What's his girlfriend like?

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.881
I haven't met her.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.247
They just started going out.
Oh, there he is.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.763
Walt!

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.046
At your cervix!

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.881
Hey, you recognize
these panties?

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.123
Rosemary, don't
steal my lines.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.884
You two know each other?

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.086
Yeah!

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.687
Gosh, Walt's been volunteering
down at the hospital for years.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.847
Oh.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.241
So where's this
mystery girl?

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.161
She should be
here any minute.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.600
Hey, I want you
to be honest.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.809
Is this outfit too
"Hey, look at me"?

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.367
No, no.
It's very subtle.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.323
Sorry I'm late.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.447
Tanya.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.688
Oh. What a surprise.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.925
<i>I've spent all
summer days drivin'</i>

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.244
<i>I'm tired of
holidays ruined</i>

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.642
<i>No more takeaways,
expired food</i>

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.846
I gotta get a map.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.249
I'm going with you.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.004
What are those for?

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.209
Ever walk through a truck-stop
men's room on your hands?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.281
Want anything?

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.283
Potato chips.
And dip.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.320
Cut it out.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.606
So, Tanya, I had no idea that you and
Walt were, you know, seeing each other.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.967
Yeah. You got a light?

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.322
It's actually
a very funny story.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.483
Because he had been asking me
out for a really long time,

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.040
and I was always
kind of unavailable.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.202
And then just when
he had given up,

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.204
I broke up with my boyfriend,
and there he was.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.567
So I asked him out.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.081
So he kind of grew
on you?

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.085
Exactly. I mean,
you gotta admit,

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.448
when you first meet him,
it is kind of jarring.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.081
I mean, you kind of don't
even know what goes where.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.369
But anyway, the timing couldn't
have been more perfect,

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.330
because he had just
sold his company,

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.482
and he has all this
time on his hands,

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.370
and we can plan things,

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.649
and travel, and go
shopping and...

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.766
Well, I guess
timing's everything.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.602
Hope you like bean dip.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.721
<i>I'd already picked up
all the faces</i>

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.600
<i>And I, I wanna
show you all the places</i>

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.810
<i>And I, I wanna
take a little ride</i>

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.167
<i>Wanna take a little ride</i>

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.005
<i>In the countryside
with you</i>

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.247
Yeah! That was
my girl.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.641
Oh, my God. I'm
the biggest nerd.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.370
Rosemary!

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.487
Ralph!

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.445
Hi.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.090
You remember Li'iBoy?

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.610
Li'iBoy. Yeah.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.284
How are you?

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.606
Mahalo, Rosemary.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.045
- How you doing?
- Great.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.170
Do they still got
you out in Sierra Leone?

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.488
No, no. Now they got
me near my home.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.404
I'm on this island in the
South Pacific called Carabas.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.891
I'm Hal.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.962
Oh, I'm sorry. Hal.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.205
These are my
Peace Corps buddies.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.046
This is Ralph Owens and Li'iBoy.
This is Hal Larson.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.849
- What's up?
- Li'iBoy.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.611
So, what are you guys
doing up here?

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.690
Li'iBoy's been stuck in the office
training for the last 30 days,

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.161
so I dragged him up here
and threw him on the slopes.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.890
It wasn't pretty.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.123
I knew this Hawaiian guy
in high school

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.761
who went out for the hockey team.
It was funny as shit.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.045
Anyway, it's great
to see you again.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.443
You look happy.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.885
Thanks. I am.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.971
Well, we got a long
drive back, so...

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.841
Bye.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.331
- Bye.
- Good to meet ya.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.051
You Okay?

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.161
It's just that do you remember how I
told you that once I had a boyfriend?

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.245
That was him.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.726
You're welcome.
Sure. What's your name?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.765
Excuse me, Mr. Robbins.
Can I have a word with you, sir?

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.330
Sure, but I gotta
catch a plane.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.050
It's only gonna
take a minute.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.045
A few weeks ago, you got trapped
in an elevator with my friend.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.361
Oh, yeah! Hal.
He was a great guy. Yes.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.522
He was having relationship
troubles. How is he?

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.961
That's a matter
of debate.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.526
Really?

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.888
Anyway, apparently, you
gave him like a pep talk,

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.363
and now he's under the impression
that he can get any woman he wants.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.688
And you don't think he can?

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.886
I don't know. Whatever.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.842
But see, the point is, lately the
only women he wants are ugly.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.888
Who says they're ugly?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.564
Bausch & Lomb.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.688
And very fat,
some of them.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.570
It's like Hal has
lowered his whole...

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.086
Jesus, you've got
a big noggin.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.286
Thanks for noticing.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.567
My new book has
a chapter on blurting.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.165
You might want
to pick it up.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.890
Yeah, I'll check into that.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.770
Anyway, I mean, did
something go wrong here?

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.241
Is he having
a nervous breakdown?

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.607
No. Haven't you
heard the phrase,

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.330
"Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder"?

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.444
Yeah. Did you ever hear the song
Who Let the <i>Dogs</i> Out?

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.527
It can't be that bad.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:19.125
Look, exactly what did
you do to him, man?

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.560
I altered his perception
a little bit.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.441
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew it!

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.403
You messed with his
eyesight, right? No.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.403
No. You hypnotized him.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:33.689
No. I dehypnotized him.
He's been hypnotized his whole life.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.761
He's totally focused
on the outside.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.486
I helped him
see inner beauty,

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.291
including people you think
are not physically attractive.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:45.684
How can he see their inner beauty
when he doesn't even know them?

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.444
Inner beauty's easy to see
when you're looking for it.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.884
But how can he not
feel them when he's...

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.804
The brain sees what the
heart wants it to feel.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.247
All right, look. Let's just cut
through the old crapcake here?

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.810
Okay.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:12.084
Sir, don't you think it's
wrong to brainwash someone?

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.049
Don't you think
you're brainwashed?

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.167
All you know about beauty
is programmed.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.926
TV, magazines, movies, they all tell
you what's beautiful, what isn't.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.526
How's this any different?

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.321
Look, I didn't come here to debate you!
I just want my friend back!

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:30.962
Now, isn't there some kind of
word or phrase or something

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.529
to take the whammy off him?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.045
Of course.
But if we do that,

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.363
he'll go back to judging
everybody by the outside.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.010
Is this what
he really wants?

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.162
I don't care!

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.965
It's what I want!
I want my friend back!

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.365
I gotta go. I gotta catch my plane.
I'm really sorry.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:52.082
Look, a man's reputation, dignity and
furniture are being trashed here!

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.051
Perhaps irreparably!
For God's sakes, his job is in jeopardy!

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.327
His job? Really?

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.765
Yes. And it's a great job.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.443
I just wanted to give him a gift.
I didn't want him to get hurt.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.330
You seem to know him
better than I do, so...

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.050
It's a shame to let it go.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.645
Oh, it's a tragedy.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.929
So, what'd you wanna
talk to me about?

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.282
Ralph called me.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.690
Your old boyfriend Ralph?

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.288
Well, he was also my division
leader in Sierra Leone.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.206
Anyway, he's shipping out
to Carabas in 10 days,

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.009
and he wants me
to go with his group.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.402
What? You and Ralph?
Carabas?

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.131
They're in
an economic meltdown.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.206
100,000 people need medical supplies
and food, and they want me to help.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.126
How can you be so selfish?

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.440
Sorry?

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.244
I mean, you know
what I'm saying.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.642
You bump into pretty boy Ralph on
Friday, the sparks are flying,

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.441
and now you're gonna go
and save the world in Carabas?

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.091
This has nothing to do
with me and Ralph.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.161
Yeah, right.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.563
He's obviously
crazy about you.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.881
He's got
the heart of a saint.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.124
I could practically see the halo around his head.
I can't compete with that.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.280
Okay, first of all, you're probably
the only person in the free world

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.601
to ever refer to Ralph
as a "pretty boy."

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.446
Secondly, that halo around his
head, it's called psoriasis.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.569
You can't stand near him
without getting flaked on.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.446
And thirdly, and fourthly, yes, he's
a great guy and he cares about me,

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.444
but he had no
sense of humor.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.404
And I'm in love with
an even greater guy.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.486
Well, then how come I don't
have any say in this thing?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.891
You do. That's why...

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.969
Oh, no! God,
are you okay?

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.407
I think so.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.323
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.641
You should be sorry!
It's an outrage!

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.881
<i>I'll go get help.</i>

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.764
Okay. Are you okay,
sweetie?

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.490
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.324
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.962
It's this flimsy-ass
four-star restaurant.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.884
Just sit right there.
I'm gonna go talk to the manager, okay?

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.883
I'll be right back.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.243
Good night.
Thank you.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.922
Look, I'm not blaming you,
but I need an extra chair.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.002
My girlfriend's jinxed
when it comes to furniture.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.844
Yeah. I know.
I'm so sorry.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.684
The waiter told me
what happened.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.762
One sec. Mclntosh's.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.240
Yes.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.361
Hello?

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.204
<i>Shallow Hal wants a gal.</i>

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.281
What?

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.046
Shallow Hal wants a gal.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.043
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.202
Ijustsaved
yourlfie,baby.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.281
<i>What?</i>

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.169
I've been looking
for you all day.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.244
I'm at Mclntosh's with Rosemary.
Look, I got kind of a...

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.890
Are you looking
right at her?

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.564
No, I'm talking to
the hostess. But...

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.364
Don't... Hal!

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.930
Look,lgot a situation here.
I'll call you later.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.002
Look away!

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.405
I was just talking
to the hostess.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.050
Right. That would be me.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.088
No, no. It was
the other hostess.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.570
Sir, I'm the only
hostess in the restaurant.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.049
Let me apologize about the booth.
We are so sorry.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.243
We've replaced your date's side
with a new chair, a strong one,

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.810
and the meal's
gonna be on us.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.967
Okay.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.361
Well, thank you.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.169
You're welcome.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.042
Excuse me. Did you...
Did you move us?

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.010
No. Second table
on the right.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.880
Well, then maybe you can explain
to me why that robust woman

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.769
is eating
my girlfriend's...

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.684
Hey! Now she's eating
my clams casino!

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.763
Sweetie, are you okay?

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.440
Excuse me.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.522
Mclntosh's. Tiffany.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.250
Okay.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.411
We're two friends walking.
Just walking. Hey, come on.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.131
And then Robbins confirmed
exactly what I thought!

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.326
Which is?

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.801
You weren't irresistible
to women.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.850
He hypnotized you so that
really ugly girls that you met

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.646
from then on would, to you,
look like supermodels.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.007
If they had inner beauty
or some baloney.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.844
See, you could get
any woman you desired

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.163
because you were suddenly
desiring the undesirable!

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.287
You get it?

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.409
No, not exactly.
Let me put it this way.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.087
It's like he gave you
beer-goggle laser surgery.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.491
Now wait a second.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.168
So what you're saying is all the pretty girls
I've met lately are not really pretty?

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.324
All right. Let's
look at the facts.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.609
They were funny,
smart and nice.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.649
Pretty girls
are not funny!

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.530
And they're certainly
not nice! Not to us!

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.284
When I found out
what he did,

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.328
I had him take
the trance away.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:34.930
When I said, "Shallow Hal
wants a gal," you were cured.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.922
You're out of your mind.
Do you know that?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.525
I'm going back
to the restaurant.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.921
Hal. Hal, come on.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.365
Hal!

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.329
You never called me back.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.801
What happened to you?
Excuse me?

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.005
Oh.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.723
I've got my hair back.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.802
It's me Katrina.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.807
We shared the cab together.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.447
I'm in town taking care
of my grandma,

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.171
'cause, she's
been sick, and...

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.130
Oh, wait a minute!
I get it!

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.449
Nice try, Mauricio.
Where'd you find this one?

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.641
No, it's me Katrina.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.241
From Boston.
The magical fruit?

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.927
Yes, I remember Katrina.
But the thing is, you're not...

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.686
I never told you about...

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.962
Katrina! How the heck are ya?
Give me some sugar.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.890
I didn't recognize you.
The hair and the...

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:52.491
You screwed me! I had a beautiful,
caring, funny, intelligent woman,

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.449
and you made her
disappear!

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.650
Oh, no, I didn't.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.371
I just made Rosemary appear!

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.807
There's a difference.
It's called reality.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:07.046
Hey, if you can see something and hear it and
smell it, what keeps it from being real?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.520
Third-party perspective.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.001
Other people agreeing
that it's real.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.803
Okay, let me ask
you a question.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.484
Who's the all-time
love of your life?

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.366
Wonder Woman.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.447
Okay. Let's say Wonder Woman
falls in love with you, right?

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.411
Would it bother you if the rest of the
world didn't find her attractive?

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.006
Not at all.
'Cause I know they'd be wrong.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.323
That's what I had
with Rosemary!

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.449
I saw a knockout!
I don't care what anybody else saw!

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.602
Jeez, I never thought
about it that way.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.404
Hey, I guess I really
did screw you?

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.450
What am I gonna do?

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.722
Hey, hey, don't panic.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.689
We just get Tony
Robbins back here,

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.524
he puts the Vulcan
mind meld on ya.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.489
Then puts you back under.
Good idea.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.006
For now, avoid Rosemary.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.081
VVhy?

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.401
Because if you see
the real Rosemary,

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.084
hypnosis is not
gonna help you.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.248
You'll need, like, the Jaws of Life
to get that image out of your head.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.042
Hal, open up. It's me.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.568
I hear you in there.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.608
Just a sec, Rosemary.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.488
What happened to you?

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.363
I got something in my eye.
I had to run back here and flush it out.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.731
Yeah, the hostess said that you seemed
a little cuckoo. So, come on, open up!

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.962
I can%.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.289
We'll club her. No.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.362
I'm... I'm...

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.649
I'm very sick!
I've got...

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.325
CC!

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.481
You have what?

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.851
Contagious conjunctivitis.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.967
I'll take my chances.
Now open up.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.808
All right.
In a minute.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.844
I told you it was nasty.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.242
Are you okay? Do you need
to go to the hospital?

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.369
Nah, nah. I got some drops.
I'll be fine.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.128
Qh, my poor baby.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.409
Yeah. Well, I should
probably rack out.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.130
This has taken
a lot out of me.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.201
Okay.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.803
Well, I'll call you in the morning
and see how you're doing.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:58.043
Great. Great. Bye-bye.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.650
<i>Pop the cork,
a champagne glass</i>

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.291
<i>Raise to the future,
drink to the past</i>

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.330
<i>Thank the Lord
for the friends he cast</i>

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.528
<i>In the play He wrote for you</i>

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.322
<i>And if you love the girl, man,
light up a torch</i>

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.244
<i>Blaze a trail
to her front porch</i>

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.926
<i>Kiss her till your lips
are scorched</i>

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.163
<i>Till the rain comes
down on you</i>

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.005
<i>Bless your sweet mistakes</i>

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.644
Hal, is everything
all right with you?

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:39.084
Yeah. Yeah, it's topnotch, sir.
Why?

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.170
Well, it's just that Rosemary's
been telling me that

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:49.087
she's having a bit of trouble getting you
on the telephone the last couple of days.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.731
Now, I wouldn't be working
you too hard, would I?

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.729
No. I mean,
I'm working hard,

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.486
but I guess I've just been a
little preoccupied with things.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.689
But I'll make sure and
touch base with her.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.690
Right.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.201
Right. Okay, then.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.007
I'm sorry. You know, apparently
this Tony Robbins guy

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.163
is tougher to track down
than I thought he'd be.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.730
I'll come through.
I promise.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.040
I can't keep this up.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.610
Hey, calm down.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.405
I don't know, Mauricio.
Maybe I should just see her.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.642
I mean, I do have...

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.288
You know, the heart thing.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.887
Maybe that's enough
to overcome her appearance.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.526
It could be like in that
movie, The Crying Game.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.251
When the guy fell in love
with a beautiful woman?

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.800
When he found out it was
a guy, it didn't matter,

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.882
'cause he already loved her.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:59.171
Hal, if a set of hairy boys was your
biggest hurdle here, I'd say go for it.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.445
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's</i> me.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.921
Hey, what's up, Rosemary?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.729
<i>What happened yesterday?</i>

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.841
Well, I stopped by your office to say
hi, but you just took off running.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.646
Oh, you're kidding.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.801
<i>No.</i>

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.121
What were you doing?

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.531
<i>I was jogging-</i>

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.125
In your business suit?

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.362
I had a sweat suit
underneath.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.204
Is everything...

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.045
What's going on, Hal?

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.566
Things haven't felt
the same lately.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.608
<i>- No?
- No.</i>

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.844
Hey, Rosemary, don't worry.
Everything...

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.881
I'm just in a little funk right now,
and everything's gonna be fine.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.405
Yeah. So...

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.690
I guess I'll talk to
you tomorrow? Bye.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.730
Bye.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.401
<i>What happened to you?</i>

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.245
<i>I can't get to you</i>

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.562
<i>'Cause there's a wall
in your heart</i>

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.689
<i>That no one can
get through</i>

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.969
<i>And it's cold and it's dark</i>

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.044
<i>And you don't have a clue</i>

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.249
<i>But this Wall, it Will fall</i>

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.243
<i>If it's the last thing I do</i>

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.090
<i>I'll get through</i>

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.965
<i>This wall in your heart</i>

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.401
Who is it?
Hal, is that you?

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.130
It's Jill.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.281
Coming.

01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.846
Hey, what's up?

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.602
My girlfriend just
bailed on me,

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.321
and I was wondering if I could
take you out to dinner.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.964
I'm sorry.
Tonight's not good.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.042
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a stiff.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.043
I want to talk to you
about some stuff.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.485
No, really. I can't.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.961
Please? We'll go
out just as friends.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.886
Oh, come on.
You gotta eat, don't you?

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.529
Can I ask you
something, Jill?

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.647
Yeah.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.969
Why the sudden thaw?

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.161
Well, I've been
thinking a lot.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.564
Hal, I made a mistake.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.724
I shouldn't have
broken it off with you.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.484
Well, you didn't
really break it off.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.409
I mean, we only had
that one date.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.926
You did the right thing.
We were going nowhere.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.241
We had nothing in
common, remember?

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.961
But that was my fault.
I shut you out emotionally.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:58.522
We could have had more things
in common if I'd wanted to.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.923
Mr. Shanahan,
how are you this evening?

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.121
How am I? Tonight I feel like a
thorn amongst a bed of roses.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.804
Your table's ready.
John will seat you.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.881
Right this way, please.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.525
I'm just gonna go
to the ladies' room.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.729
Okay, Rosie,
we'll be at the table.

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.530
Yeah. See, why did you shut
me out in the first place?

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.568
I'm just curious.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.441
Well, frankly, I guess I
thought you were shallow.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.527
Me?

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:54.642
Yeah. You struck me as this
kind of superficial dickwad.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.326
I don't know.
What do you call it?

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.167
Hal, it's okay. I've been
watching you the past few weeks.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.129
I've seen the women
you go out with.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:10.491
And now I know appearances mean
absolutely nothing to you.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.285
If anything, you're
pathologically unshallow.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.720
I don't know
about that.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:18.881
It's true.

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.564
Listen, I have an idea.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.281
Why don't we get all
this food to go? Why?

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.606
Because it'll taste
a lot better in bed.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.684
You know, there are a few
times in a guy's life,

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.122
and I mean like two
or three, tops,

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.409
when he comes to a crossroads,
and he's gotta decide.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.723
If he goes one way, he can
continue what he's doing

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.529
and be with any girl
who will have him,

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.844
and if he goes the other way, he
gets to be with only one woman,

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.127
maybe for the rest
of his life.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.486
Now, it seems like by taking the second
road, he's missing out on a lot.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.042
But the truth is, he gets
much more in return.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.811
He gets to be happy.
Are you wearing panties?

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.604
God, what am I saying? No!

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:21.641
No, I'm sorry. Jill, this...
This isn't gonna happen.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.886
I think I'm gonna go down
that other road for once.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.924
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.481
Hello?

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.291
He)', hey, hey now.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.408
It's me, your love bunny.

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.131
<i>I miss you and
I wanna see you.</i>

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.250
<i>What's the matter?
You sound upset.</i>

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.891
What are you,
some kind of psycho?

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.411
God.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.529
Hello? Rosie?

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.006
Just you leave me
daughter alone.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.206
I don't understand.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.681
The jig is up,
and she knows it!

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.923
Well, she hasn't returned my calls.
What's going on?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.447
It's a little late to be worrying
about that now, don't you think?

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.889
Besides, she went and accepted
that Peace Corps assignment.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.482
No offense, Mr. Shanahan, but I think
I have a right to hear this from her.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.962
I'll give you your rights.
I'll give you your last rites,

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.327
you self-righteous
little shit!

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.927
You know, I wanted to like you.
I truly did.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.210
And all of that malarkey that you
gave me that night at the house,

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.566
I bought into it.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.284
In spite of all me better
instincts, I took the hook.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.965
I don't know.
Maybe I share in the blame of it all.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.206
Maybe I just... I just wanted to believe
that there was still a decent guy out there.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.886
A lad that would be
right for me daughter.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.961
But, sir...

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.566
Don't speak!
Just you listen!

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.326
Now, thankfully, as it turns
out, there is a guy out there.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.124
His name is Ralph Owens.

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.881
Pretty boy Ralph?

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:54.282
Don't be a smart-ass.
Now you listen to me.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:58.729
They're back together, and me
daughter has a chance to be happy.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:02.247
And you, you'll be
respectin' that.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.647
<i>Well, I dreamed I saw
the knights in armor coming</i>

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.685
<i>Saying something about a queen</i>

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:25.923
<i>There were peasants singin'
and drummers drummin '.</i> ..

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.686
Excuse me. Could you tell me what
floor Rosemary Shanahan works on?

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.889
I think she's up
in Pediatrics.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.325
Yeah. That's third floor.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.561
Thank you.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:40.487
<i>That was floating
on the breeze</i>

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.969
Hal, is that you?

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.201
Hey.

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.164
What are you doing here?

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.321
I...

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.807
I came to see Rosemary.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:01.169
Oh, well, she left early.
She seemed upset about something.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.927
Any idea where
she went?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.047
You got me.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.730
Hi, Hal.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.566
Hi.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.965
How do you know
my name?

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.042
It's me Cadence.

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.763
Oh. Hi, Cadence.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.082
How are you, beautiful?

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.767
How come you haven't
come back to see us?

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.890
Well...

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.601
Me and Rosemary have been
having some problems.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.365
I was really stupid.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.689
Well, why don't you go buy her a present
and then maybe you can make up?

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.724
You were right.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:54.121
In the gym last week when you said I
was scared of women, you were right.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.529
Nah, I didn't mean that.
I was just...

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.729
No, come on, Hal.
It's the truth.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.842
I'm terrified of 'em.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.289
I haven't been close
to a woman my whole life.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.002
I'm a coward, all right?

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:32.129
But why? I mean, look at you.
You're a mountain of a man.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.282
You got more style
than Mr. Blackwell.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:38.809
You're pulling in what,
28, 29 G's a year?

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.041
$29,500.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.043
You're the perfect catch.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.727
I know. I know.
It's crazy.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.246
I just have this thing.

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.927
What thing?

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.811
It's kind of a

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.884
birth defect thing.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.646
Jeez, man. I didn't know.
What is it?

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.404
I have a tail.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:08.961
A tail.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.764
What do you mean,
like a story?

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.810
No, a tail.
It's like a waggy tail.

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.770
My backbone is longer
than it's supposed to be.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.850
It's like a genetic
abnormality.

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.206
It's a vestigial tail.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.964
You do not.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.326
Yeah, I do.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.084
Get out!

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.084
You see? If I can't even get
my best friend to accept it,

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.924
how am I supposed
to expect some woman to?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.923
Wait a second.
Are you for real?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.207
'Cause if you are,
I gotta see this.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.009
No, you don't wanna see it.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.208
No, I don't wanna
I gotta.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.571
Good Lord.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.120
All right.
You believe me now?

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.088
Oh, man.
It really does wag.

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.484
Only when I'm nervous
or happy.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:11.403
Have you ever
thought about, you know,

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.324
maybe getting it cut off?

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.088
Cut off? I don't know why
I never thought of that

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.961
when I was getting pummeled in gym
class by a bunch of barking seniors!

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.722
All right, calm down.

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.961
God!

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.725
The damn thing is wrapped around an artery!
No doctor will touch it!

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.723
Well, it's not so bad.

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.010
I guarantee you there's some girls out
there who would think it was adorable.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.241
Like a little puppy dog.

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.127
Really?

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.720
You think it's like
a puppy dpp?

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.848
It's cute as a button.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.162
You want to pet
the little fella?

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.730
No!

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.364
But, you know, I'm not
much of a dog person.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.848
By the way, you're gonna need a
little sod on the fairway there.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.881
What do you mean?

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.970
So, what are you
doing right now?

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.883
- Nothing. Why?
- Can I get a lift?

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:23.962
I gotta go see
someone.

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.725
- Yeah. Sure.
- Great.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.810
<i>Feels like
longer than forever, yeah</i>

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.168
<i>My home is now
a distant land</i>

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.961
<i>If I had one wish,
I wish I could be</i>

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:39.044
<i>Back on that rock
in the middle of the sea</i>

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.806
<i>My heart is calling me
to the islands</i>

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:46.009
<i>My home is now
a distant land</i>

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.482
<i>If I had one wish,
I wish I could be</i>

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.528
<i>Back on that rock...</i>

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.690
Hey! Hal, right?

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.881
Have we met?

01:36:58.680 --> 01:36:59.727
It's me, Li'iBoy.

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.321
I met you up in the
mountains with Ralph.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.648
Oh, yeah, Li'iBoy.
How ya doing? Yeah.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:12.411
Yeah, you look like
you've been working out.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.005
Nah.

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.606
So, do you know
if Ralph is in the office?

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.123
Yeah. Ralph!

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.006
Hal! Hey, Hal.

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.047
Hey.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.810
- Yeah.
- How ya doing?

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:33.408
Oh, I'm doing great. You're looking good.
So, what can I do you for?

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.967
I came here to
congratulate you.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.605
Oh. On?

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.361
Look...

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.249
You got a great girl,
and you deserve her.

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.042
More than me.

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.522
And the truth is,
I'm happy for Rosemary.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:57.290
But understand this.
You better be good to her, Ralph.

01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.044
You better be good to her.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.205
Ralph, if you ever...
If you ever mess up and make her unhappy,

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.966
I'll be waiting in the wings, and
I'll pounce on you. Like a tiger!

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.001
Like a tiger on a deer, with a
cloven hoof and with a broken arm!

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.845
Hal.
What are you talking about?

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.491
I know you're back together.
Let's not play games.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.688
Rosemary and I
aren't back together.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.807
You're not?

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.330
Well, let's put it
this way.

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.485
Her parents are throwing a going-away
party for her as we speak.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.846
I wasn't even invited.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.924
<i>We are building a religion
we are building it bigger</i>

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.846
<i>We are widening the corridors
and adding more lanes</i>

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.646
This seems crazy.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.210
Yeah.
That's 'cause it is.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:51.924
But crazy's all you got.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.126
Amen to that.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:57.649
Good luck, Hal.

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.644
<i>It is useless to resist it,
his cigarette is burning</i>

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.605
<i>He is living comfort eagle,
you can meet at his location</i>

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.401
<i>But you better come with cash,
now his hat is on backwards</i>

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.209
Well, I could
use a drink.

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.602
What do you say we
slide around the side here?

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.529
Yeah, we'll blend in.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.361
Yeah.

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:26.890
Hello?

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.205
Rosie?

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.044
Excuse me.
What are you doing...

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.485
I love you.

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.609
I'm not going anywhere
until you hear me out.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:57.481
What are you doing?

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.526
Who are you?

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.806
Who... Hal, are you drunk?
It's me, Mrs. Shanahan.

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:12.721
I have some things to say to your daughter
and I'm not leaving here until I do.

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.525
Okay. But could you release Helga
so she can get back to work?

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.402
Get ready, Li'iBoy.
It's show time.

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.249
Well, Hal,
now's your chance.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.765
What are you doing here?

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:24.641
Oh, my God.
You're beautiful.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.401
You have no right
to be here.

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.049
Hal, come on.
This isn't working out.

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.690
I'm okay.

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.161
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.090
I'm having a word
with your daughter.

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.969
Well, it better be goodbye!

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.087
You've got her all up...

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.009
Steve! Shut up.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.330
Rosemary, I am so
sorry that I hurt you.

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:59.490
I've been really dumb.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.608
I'm immature.
I'm unthoughtful.

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.523
I'm a friggin' idiot.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.611
But I love you.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:11.921
You're the only girl
I've ever loved.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.570
And I just didn't want you to
go away without knowing that.

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.890
You really hurt me.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.165
I know.

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.130
But if you'll let me,

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.727
I want to spend the rest of
my life making it up to you.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.327
Well, your timing
is terrible.

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.406
I mean, I'm leaving for Carabas
tonight for 14 months.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.921
I'm sorry, Rosemary.
I just can't wait that long.

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.606
I understand.

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.686
Which is why
I'm going with you.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.281
What?

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.408
Yeah, it's true, Rosie.

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.169
Big Kahuna here just swore him into
the Corps about a half-hour ago.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.561
That's right.
He's official.

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.840
Are you sure that's
what you want to do?

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.165
Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.485
<i>It can never explain
your heart</i>

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:42.127
<i>And the touch</i>

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:45.161
<i>of my "PS</i>

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.245
<i>You want me to change</i>

01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.210
<i>I can't get used to</i>

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.329
<i>All you want me to be</i>

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:07.610
<i>And I just can't pretend</i>

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.411
<i>To be anyone else</i>

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:14.089
<i>'Cause it's not really me</i>

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:16.606
<i>This is my world</i>

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.001
<i>This is who I am</i>

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:23.768
<i>And I'm not trying
to give up myself</i>

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.047
<i>To make your life better</i>

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.963
<i>She said</i>

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.044
<i>This is how it is</i>

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.401
<i>I got my own life to live</i>

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:36.927
<i>And you can either
accept me or</i>

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.611
<i>And if it's love</i>

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.524
<i>That we share</i>

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.682
Here's your bag, Rosemary.
Thank you.

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.211
Congratulations, Hal.

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.361
Thank you. Hey.

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:49.566
- Rosemary.
- Bye.

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.404
Just keep it right there
at the airport.

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.131
I'll pick it up later.
Congrats.

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.201
We love you, Rosie.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.089
I love you, Mom!

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:01.484
Yes. And, Rosemary, you'd
better be looking after me lad.

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:02.971
I will

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.884
<i>She ain't got no money,
her clothes are kinda funny</i>

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.041
Later, dudes!

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.962
<i>Her hair is kinda
wild and free</i>

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:15.807
<i>Oh, but love grows
where my Rosemary goes</i>

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:18.247
<i>And nobody knows like</i> me...

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.766
Say bye-bye
Bye-bye.

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:25.050
<i>She talks kind of lazy,
people say she's crazy</i>

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.283
<i>And her love's a mystery...</i>

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.011
You like puppy dogs
do you?

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.845
Oh! Anything to do
with dogs, I melt.

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.444
Why don't we go around back,
get a little drink?

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.604
Sure. Yeah? Come on, big fella.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.761
<i>It's a feelin' that's fine,
and I just gotta say</i>

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.001
<i>He)'</i>

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.970
<i>She's really got
a magical spell</i>

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.247
<i>And it's workin' so well</i>

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:57.847
<i>That I can't get away</i>

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.891
<i>I'm a lucky fella
and I just gotta tell her</i>

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.766
<i>That I love her endlessly</i>

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.761
<i>Because love grows
where my Rosemary goes</i>

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:17.803
<i>And nobody knows like me</i>

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.602
<i>There's something
about her hand holdin' mine</i>

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.005
<i>It's a feelin' that's fine,
and I just gotta say, hey</i>

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:38.402
<i>She's really got
a magical spell</i>

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:44.362
<i>And it's workin' so well
that I can't get away</i>

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:50.729
<i>I'm a lucky fella
and I just gotta tell her</i>

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:54.287
<i>That I love her endlessly</i>

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:59.400
<i>Because love grows
where my Rosemary goes</i>

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:05.761
<i>And nobody knows like me</i>

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:17.604
<i>It keeps growing
every place she's been</i>

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.889
<i>And nobody knows like me</i>

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.810
<i>If you met her
you'll never forget her</i>

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.567
<i>And nobody knows like me</i>

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.842
<i>We are building a religion</i>

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.843
<i>We are building it bigger</i>

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.641
<i>We are widening the corridors
and adding more lanes</i>

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:52.725
<i>We are building a religion,
a limited edition</i>

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.805
<i>We are now accepting callers
for these pendant key chains</i>

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.805
<i>To resist it is useless,
it is useless to resist it</i>

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.646
<i>His cigarette is burning
but he never seems to ash</i>

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:08.645
<i>He is grooming his poodle,
he is living comfort eagle</i>

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:12.566
<i>You can meet at his location
but you better come with cash</i>

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.531
<i>Now his hat is on backwards,
he can show you his tattoos</i>

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.843
<i>He is in the music business,
he is calling you</i>

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:20.921
<i>Dude!</i>

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.761
<i>Now today is tomorrow,
and tomorrow today</i>

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:28.526
<i>And yesterday is weaving
in and out, out, out</i>

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.525
<i>And the fluffy white lines that
the airplane leaves behind</i>

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.127
<i>Are drifting right in front
of the waning of the moon</i>

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.521
<i>He is handling the money</i>

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.489
<i>He's serving the food</i>

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.643
<i>He knows about your party,
he is calling you</i>

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:44.687
<i>Dude!</i>

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.367
<i>Now do you believe
in the one big sign?</i>

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:52.001
<i>The doublewide shine
on the bootheels of your prime</i>

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:55.880
<i>Doesn't matter if you're skinny,
doesn't matter if you're fat</i>

01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:59.885
<i>You can dress up like a sultan
in your onion-head hat</i>

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:04.170
<i>We are building a religion,
we are making a brand</i>

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.722
<i>We're the only ones to turn to
when your castles turn to sand</i>

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.805
<i>Take a bite of this apple,
Mr. Corporate Events</i>

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.851
<i>Take a walk through the jungle
of cardboard shanties and tents</i>

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:19.970
<i>Some people drink Pepsi,
some people drink Coke</i>

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.647
<i>The wacky morning deejay
says democracy's a joke</i>

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:27.884
<i>He says now do you believe
in the one big song?</i>

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.407
<i>He's now accepting callers
who would like to sing along</i>

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.963
<i>He says do you believe
in the one true edge?</i>

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:39.761
<i>By fastening your safety belts
and stepping towards the ledge</i>

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.561
<i>He is handling the money,
he is serving the food</i>

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:47.082
<i>He is now accepting callers,
he is calling me</i>

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:48.161
<i>Dude!</i>

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.767
<i>Now do you believe
in the one big sign?</i>

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:55.447
<i>The doublewide shine
on the bootheels of your prime</i>

01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.445
<i>There's no need to ask directions
if you ever lose your mind</i>

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.761
<i>We're behind you,
we're behind you</i>

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.763
<i>And let us please remind you</i>

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.367
<i>We can send a car to find you
if you ever lose your way</i>

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.362
<i>I think of you</i>

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.404
<i>Wherever you may go</i>

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:57.931
<i>I know that you are only
one dream away</i>

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.881
<i>So don't give up, baby</i>

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.123
<i>Don't give in</i>

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:13.242
<i>If we try we can begin again</i>

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.441
<i>I know what we've been through</i>

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.685
<i>But I still think of you</i>

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:45.129
<i>I think of you</i>

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:51.841
<i>Whenever I get down</i>

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:56.645
<i>Whenever I get weary</i>

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:02.371
<i>I think of you</i>

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:10.203
<i>When you're not around</i>

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.286
<i>I wonder if you hear me
call out your name</i>

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.366
<i>So don't give up, baby</i>

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:24.011
<i>Don't give in</i>

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:31.727
<i>If we try we can begin again</i>

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:37.851
<i>I know what we've been through</i>

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:42.689
<i>But I still think of you</i>

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:03.803
<i>I think of you</i>

01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:10.765
<i>Whenever I get down</i>

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.925
<i>Whenever I get weary</i>

01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.210
<i>I think of you</i>

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:24.806
Hey, kid. How 'bout
these Rossi boots?

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:27.167
They fit like
a glove or what?
