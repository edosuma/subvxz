08:11.991 --> 08:14.794
and politically relevant
Strain O' the Day.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.597
Behold, the first ever cannabis

08:17.663 --> 08:20.933
smuggled out of the People's
Democratic Republic of North Korea.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.203
It's called Pyongyang Green.

08:26.072 --> 08:29.509
Look at this lush, well-nourished,
leafy flower

08:29.575 --> 08:35.014
that has over a hundred times the THC
of your sickly Western degenerate bud.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.851
Also, it doesn't give you the munchies,

08:38.918 --> 08:41.554
which is very useful
if you're a North Korean.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.825
Now, this beauty was found
in a secret pocket

08:45.892 --> 08:48.261
in the knapsack of a dissident
who drowned

08:48.528 --> 08:50.796

08:51.697 --> 08:53.599
And we're selling it for 40 bucks.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.737
I don't feel good about that.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.006
We should either charge less

09:00.072 --> 09:02.942
or donate that money
to refugee swimming lessons.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.978

09:06.045 --> 09:07.213

Get what?

You brought some girl here
to make me jealous on a Wednesday,

09:54.927 --> 09:56.963
which is the one day you know
I don't shower.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.766
Okay, first of all, I didn't know that.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.602
Second of all, yikes.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.273
Look, I brought Tina here
because she's a stoner,

10:07.340 --> 10:11.611

and chicks go nuts for that shit.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.680

No. No, this-- This is good.

Bro-livia's got a date tonight, too.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.288

Can't get more than two,
three hours of sleep at night.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.963
Plus, the last woman I was with--
I mean, I...

11:05.731 --> 11:07.033
I messed that up because of...

11:17.877 --> 11:19.311
Ruth, I feel guilty...

11:20.913 --> 11:22.081
just being alive.

Well, that's true.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.462
I ran into her
at Jane Fonda's exercise class,

12:43.529 --> 12:46.265
and I just said,
"You know what? Lose the little guy."

12:46.866 --> 12:47.867
Exactly.

12:48.234 --> 12:51.871
You have within you the wisdom
of Gaia, the Earth Mother.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.974
But-- But Carter is a 30-year-old man.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.510
He's a veteran with PTSD.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.346
I don't have the first clue
what to say to him.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.381
Well, he came to you.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.284
And that means he wants
to hear whatever you have to say.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.821
And that means anything you have
to say will be right.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.524
But that doesn't make any sense.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.459
I mean, isn't that presumptuous of me--?

13:13.526 --> 13:15.995
You dare question me?

13:16.061 --> 13:17.530
I'm your inner goddess.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.132
Thunder and lightning!

13:30.943 --> 13:32.578
Jenny, does it smell funny in here?

13:33.212 --> 13:35.414
Well, it is Olivia's No-Shower Wednesday.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.920
No, I mean the plants. They've smelled
weird ever since you cleaned the tank.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.255
Oh?

13:45.391 --> 13:47.059
What do they smell like?

13:47.126 --> 13:53.966
Well, I'm getting a little... [sniffs]
creeping lobelia and wolfberry. And...

13:54.400 --> 13:57.102
I wanna say pigs' testicles?

14:02.241 --> 14:04.443
Pete, please don't be mad...

14:06.845 --> 14:09.415
but I dumped my mother's
special herbal tea in the tank

14:09.481 --> 14:11.517
in a symbolic act of catharsis.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.221
I'm sorry.
I should've cleared it with you,

14:15.287 --> 14:17.056
but sometimes you just gotta cathart.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.126
You fuck shitter!

14:21.193 --> 14:22.595
You shitting fuck!

14:22.862 --> 14:25.431
You put foreign substances
in the water my plants drink

14:25.497 --> 14:28.400
-without asking me?
-You said they're doing better than ever.

14:28.467 --> 14:32.171
Jenny, unlike you, I don't have children.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.542
-I don't have children.
-These are my children.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.544
And I am responsible for raising them.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.113
That means I'm in charge
of when they sleep,

14:41.180 --> 14:44.216
how much light they get,
what they watch on Family Movie Night,

14:44.283 --> 14:48.187
and most importantly,
what goes in their shit-fucking water.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.488
I'm really sorry, Pete.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.290
I didn't think it was a big deal.

14:51.357 --> 14:54.393
It wasn't a big deal? If you were
on the compound where I grew up,

14:54.460 --> 14:56.662
you'd have to spend a week
in the Big Deal Room.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.100
What's in the Big Deal Room?

15:01.166 --> 15:03.669
I don't know,
because I never had to go there.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.238
Get out.

15:12.411 --> 15:16.482
[sighs] I am so sorry, sheilas.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.986
I've done dwumbled it again.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.490
Drango. [sighs]

15:25.291 --> 15:26.492
I'm a damn stroob.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.695
Ugh. Worse than a stroob.

15:30.462 --> 15:31.363
I'm a failure.

15:32.464 --> 15:35.935
[Sadie in Mandarin]

15:37.136 --> 15:38.337
I don't speak Chinese.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.206
[Sadie in English]  I said,
you're not a failure, Pete.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.641
Wha...?

15:50.582 --> 15:52.318
So, Carter...

15:52.952 --> 15:53.652
um...

15:54.954 --> 15:57.256
over the years,
a lot of people have opened up to me

15:57.323 --> 16:01.560
about their problems,
and, frankly, most of those problems...

16:02.361 --> 16:03.729
and people, were stupid.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.333
But not you.

16:08.233 --> 16:09.635
You really matter to me.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.971
And on reflection,

16:12.037 --> 16:15.607
I realize that maybe...
I'm not the best person

16:15.674 --> 16:17.576
to give you the help that you need.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.180
But I have a friend
who's a clinical psychologist.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.083
And he's really smart.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.751
He deals with a lot of veterans.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.653
And I told him about you--

16:27.720 --> 16:29.321
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.558
You told some psychologist about me?

16:33.525 --> 16:34.994
Well, I didn't use your name.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.696
I just told him you worked here for me
as a security guard.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.707
I came to you... in confidence.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.543
The first thing you do
is you pawn me off to somebody else,

16:51.610 --> 16:53.212
put my business in the street.

16:53.278 --> 16:56.582
You know, I could call ten psychologists
about all the crazy shit you do.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.451
But you know what?
I respect people's privacy.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.154
The fuck, Ruth?

17:07.526 --> 17:08.460
[sighs]

17:10.162 --> 17:11.696
So, what'd I miss?

17:12.431 --> 17:13.298
Christ.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.104
Wow. Gorgeous.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.074
[chuckles] The joint's not bad, either.
Am I right?

17:22.674 --> 17:24.675
[Tina & Travis laughing]

17:29.815 --> 17:30.816
Can you do me a favor?

17:31.316 --> 17:33.819
Find something wrong with her
so I don't go hang myself?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.290
Nothing's wrong with her.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.492
Travis got himself a real hottie
this time.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.327
What do you mean this time?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.264
My God, you're so pretty and so skinny.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.198
Shut up.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.636
-Carter.
-Carter.

17:50.702 --> 17:54.239
The man, the myth, the missing person.

17:54.306 --> 17:55.407
[Dabby] Whoa.

17:56.175 --> 17:59.812
I gotta say, Carter looks way different
when he's not here.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.647
-[Dank] Yeah.
-[chuckles]

18:02.281 --> 18:04.683
Yeah. That's a great observation, baby,
but no problem,

18:04.750 --> 18:06.518
'cause Dank will now be Carter.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.188
-Oh, yeah. I'll be Dabby.
-Yeah. Okay.

18:10.489 --> 18:11.423
[Dabby clears throat]

18:13.625 --> 18:15.661
[in deep voice] ID and recommendation,
please.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.765
Come on, Carter, it's me, Dabby.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.800
Oh, well, nice try, Dabby.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.570
But if you were Dabby,
then where's your boyfriend, Dank?

18:32.544 --> 18:33.779
Oh, fuck.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.681
I mean, he was just here.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.518
-Those guys are hilarious.
-Yeah.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.587
Yeah, we sponsor their YouTube channel.

18:41.653 --> 18:42.888
Another one of my ideas.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.390
Hey, yo, Dank, Dabby, join us.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.493
[in normal voice] Heh. Well, yo,
what's up, Trav?

18:47.559 --> 18:48.894
I would've been over here earlier,

18:49.161 --> 18:51.196
but Carter was giving Dabby
a real hard time.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.568
Well, Dank, Dabby, this is Tina.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.604
Ooh, Tina.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.806
Tina Fey, Tina...

19:01.440 --> 19:03.509
Fey Dunaway with murder.

19:03.575 --> 19:04.643
Shh!

19:06.778 --> 19:07.646
Tina.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.315
You got what I like.

19:10.849 --> 19:12.851
[Tina laughing]

19:14.186 --> 19:15.787
Come on, now. On your feet.

19:17.589 --> 19:18.891
[Travis laughs]

19:19.158 --> 19:20.292
[laughs mockingly]

19:22.327 --> 19:25.497
Mm-hm. Come on, now.
Give us a little twirl. Come on.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.301
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

19:29.368 --> 19:30.869
I didn't say sit down!

19:30.936 --> 19:32.171
No, she didn't.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.239
[Tina laughing]

19:36.675 --> 19:37.609
Okay, sit down.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.280
So, Tina...

19:41.713 --> 19:42.648
let me ask you.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.784
Who's your Dabby?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.289
I'm sorry. These guys are crazy. I--

19:50.355 --> 19:52.591
No, I love their energy.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.194
Oh. We got a lot of energy, Tina.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.595
Energy. E.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.630
E equals MC cubed--

19:58.697 --> 20:02.334
Don't you fuck this up
with that wordplay shit, Dank!

20:03.235 --> 20:04.203
-Fuck!
-All right!

20:04.269 --> 20:05.337
-Fuck!
-All right!

20:05.404 --> 20:06.271
[Tina laughing]

20:06.338 --> 20:07.506
-Fuck!
-All right!

20:09.975 --> 20:11.543
-Guys?
-[Dabby] So, Tina...

20:12.578 --> 20:14.413
I'm just gonna put this out there.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.615
You got great tits.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.350
So do I.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.322
We should get them together
for a little play date, hmm?

20:25.290 --> 20:28.260
Okay, okay. Look-- Hey, Olivia.
[clears throat]

20:28.327 --> 20:30.729
Would you mind just getting Dank
and Dabby their free weed?

20:30.796 --> 20:34.399
-Tina and I were gonna go get lunch, guys.
-Oh, cool. I could eat.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.971
I could eat for half an hour nonstop.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.341
Like Pac-Man:

20:42.407 --> 20:43.775
[mimicking Pac-Man munching]

20:45.544 --> 20:46.411
Yeah.

20:46.478 --> 20:48.013
And I when I go down...

20:48.280 --> 20:49.748
[in descending pitch] Euh, euh, euh...

20:49.815 --> 20:50.782
Oh, dear God.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.385
-[Travis mimicking Pac-Man munching]
-[Tina laughing]

20:55.020 --> 20:57.422
That is so interesting.

20:57.489 --> 20:59.558
I never thought of nitrogen
like that before.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.493
[chuckles]

21:01.560 --> 21:03.262
So smart.

21:03.695 --> 21:05.530
[Sadie]  We're smart because of you.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.967
[Coco]  You're the best daddy ever.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.338
[Sadie]  And that tea really helped, too.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.374
Really? You liked the tea?

21:15.440 --> 21:16.875
[Sadie]  We loved it.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.777
-Right, girls?
-[plants]  Yeah!

21:18.844 --> 21:20.612
-More tea!
-[plant 1 exclaiming in Mandarin]

21:20.679 --> 21:22.814
[plant 2]  More tea! More tea!

21:23.515 --> 21:24.616
[Jenny] Pete?

21:24.883 --> 21:27.352
I'm sorry about what I did to the plants.

21:28.320 --> 21:28.987
No.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.958
You've done a wonderful thing.

21:34.993 --> 21:36.662
[plants]  Aw.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.365
Okay, you're starting to worry me.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.768
Well, this will make you feel better.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.903
The plants have something
they wanna tell you.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.606
Sadie...

21:48.507 --> 21:49.508
you have the floor.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.411
She's their leader.

21:57.516 --> 21:58.950
-Pete, I think--
-Shh, let her finish.

22:03.922 --> 22:05.023
Can you believe that?

22:05.857 --> 22:08.627
Twelve weeks old, and so eloquent.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.363
All right.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.000
Sadie, please tell Pete to smoke less
and get some sleep.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.703
[Pete laughing]

22:17.769 --> 22:18.737
What's so funny?

22:18.804 --> 22:20.939
That's not Sadie. That's Coco.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.008
[Pete laughing]

22:23.842 --> 22:24.976
[Dank coughs]

22:25.043 --> 22:26.945
Our next viewer question.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.515
-"Dear Dank and Dabby--" That's us.
-[laughs]

22:30.949 --> 22:33.351
"How are you not dead yet?"

22:33.418 --> 22:34.953
[both laugh]

22:35.020 --> 22:36.088
Oh, man.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.990
-We get that one all the time.
-So much.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.926
Well, we stay in shape.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.361
We ran a Toyotathon last year.

22:43.428 --> 22:44.463
[both laugh]

22:45.497 --> 22:47.766
Also, we, like, smoke a lot.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.668
-And that's how you cure things.
-Yeah.

22:49.735 --> 22:52.404
Like bacon is cured with smoke.

22:52.471 --> 22:53.839
That's how they fix it.

22:55.907 --> 22:58.376
-[laughs]
-Fucking mind blown.

22:58.443 --> 22:59.511
Whoa!

22:59.578 --> 23:01.713
-Fucking mind blown.
-[mimics explosion]

23:01.780 --> 23:03.782
And I smoke any time I'm not feeling good.

23:03.849 --> 23:07.719
Like one time I had a cold,
and I got high, and I got my cold high.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.389
Do you guys have any almond milk?

23:11.790 --> 23:12.924
Top shelf, babe.

23:26.104 --> 23:28.507
What are we gonna do about her, Dank?

23:29.407 --> 23:30.575
I don't know.

23:31.777 --> 23:35.046
This is why I don't like three-ways.
It's one way too many.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.651
-I'm a one-woman man, at most, baby.
-At most, yeah.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.086
And sometimes not even that.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.022
I'm like, "Get out of the room.
Let me tug my own penis."

23:44.089 --> 23:44.956
Yeah.

23:46.024 --> 23:49.694
I mean, like, the-- The sex--
The sex wasn't even that good.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.163
-So overrated.
-Yeah, it was--

23:51.429 --> 23:54.566
-Just, like, bodies, sweat, moist.
-Bodies and sweat and just moist.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.201
-And just like-- Guh--
-In the bed--

23:56.935 --> 23:59.004
-It was fucking awesome!
-It was fucking good!

23:59.070 --> 24:00.138
I fucking loved it!

24:00.205 --> 24:02.507
-Unh! Unh! Ow! Ooh!
-Ah!

24:02.574 --> 24:04.142
-Let's go fuck again!
-Let's fuck her!

24:04.776 --> 24:05.744
After you.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.948
[Dabby on-screen]
Oh, did you turn the camera off?

24:10.015 --> 24:11.683
[Dank on-screen]  I'm pretty sure I did.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.921
So, Tina ended it with you?

24:15.987 --> 24:17.856
Uh-- I think so.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.559
Pretty sure she lives
with Dank and Dabby now.

24:21.159 --> 24:22.694
Well, you know what they say.

24:23.495 --> 24:26.464
If you love someone,
give them to two ridiculous stoners.

24:26.898 --> 24:29.501
And if they come back,
then you really don't want them.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.107
Hey. Are you okay?

24:37.776 --> 24:38.810
Yeah. Give me a minute?

24:51.790 --> 24:53.792
[tinkling]

25:06.538 --> 25:07.205
[man] Hey, Carter.

25:07.806 --> 25:08.673
Carter.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.710
You know what I miss the most, man?

25:17.582 --> 25:18.650
Green.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.019
The color green.

25:23.955 --> 25:26.258
Enough of this tan-camel shit.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.793
I miss real green.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.730
Like trees, bushes, grass.

25:54.119 --> 25:55.787
"Better not tell you now."

25:57.923 --> 25:59.658
Fuck you, eight ball.

26:00.992 --> 26:02.694
Magic, my ass.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.329
[knocking on door]

26:06.164 --> 26:07.832
-Hey, Ruth.
-Hey, Carter.

26:14.272 --> 26:15.907
What I said earlier, I...

26:15.974 --> 26:16.908
Forget about it.

26:16.975 --> 26:20.812
You know, I never should have called
that guy without talking to you first.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.248
Yeah, well, since you did...

26:25.183 --> 26:26.718
This is not easy for me.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.320
Hey, before I forget,

26:28.586 --> 26:32.023
I picked up one
of these word-find books that you like.

26:43.902 --> 26:44.769
Thank you.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.038
Happy searching.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.717
[cartoonish music playing on-screen]

26:59.884 --> 27:01.619
[Roadrunner on-screen]  Meep, meep.

27:05.824 --> 27:06.691
Meep, meep.

27:10.762 --> 27:12.931
Now, what the fuck is he doing?

27:14.032 --> 27:15.233
[Roadrunner]  Meep, meep.

27:16.868 --> 27:17.802
Meep, meep.

27:20.138 --> 27:24.943
See, the dingo is constantly pursuing
the kookaburra all over the outback.

27:27.379 --> 27:30.315
No, Sadie.
I don't think he wants to play with him.

27:31.216 --> 27:32.384
He wants to eat him.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.353
No, no, don't be scared.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.822
See, the kookaburra, he's a crafty one.

27:38.123 --> 27:41.693
He's always one step ahead
of the dingo's crazy contraptions.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.929
Sorry, Coco, you're right.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.031
I'll stop talking.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.199
[air whistling on-screen]

27:48.266 --> 27:49.134
[crash on-screen]

27:49.200 --> 27:50.902
[warbly effect plays on-screen]
