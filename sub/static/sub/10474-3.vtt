00:36.940 --> 00:39.490
'The people who were
reclaiming their city

00:39.540 --> 00:44.010
'from the bombs of an old war,
there was now a drive to cleanse,

00:44.060 --> 00:46.090
'a desire to build anew

00:46.140 --> 00:48.410
'and a need to forge a world

00:48.460 --> 00:51.130
'that was worthy of its citizens.'

00:55.460 --> 00:58.810
A gentleman's convenience ain't
what you'd call handsome,

00:58.860 --> 00:59.970
but it's places like these

01:00.020 --> 01:03.650
that will become our temporary centre
of command in a nuclear attack.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.180
They will withstand the heat,
blast and fallout of the H bomb.

01:08.260 --> 01:11.730
They are slap bang in the middle
of where people need us

01:11.780 --> 01:14.530
and it's from here
that we will organise

01:14.580 --> 01:18.930
the distribution of provisions such
as tinned food, drinks and the like.

01:18.980 --> 01:21.690
They putting supplies in for
babies? Milk powder and that?

01:21.740 --> 01:25.010
Don't worry, Tony. Hope for
the best, plan for the worst.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.690
You've got more to worry
about than rats, old son.

01:29.740 --> 01:31.940
Give me that stick, Fred.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.410
Filthy little things.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.330
Spreading disease.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.500
Fred has put down rat
poison for a reason.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.970
Poplar is in the middle
of an infestation.

01:54.020 --> 01:57.810
As a herbivore, you cannot
condone this cull.

01:57.860 --> 02:00.130
The rat is a vehicle for disease.

02:00.180 --> 02:06.050
Poison the rat and through clouds
of time and space, you poison man.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.729
We are all essentially the rat.

02:08.780 --> 02:09.970
Speak for yourself.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.290
I've had enough of hearing
about the wretched things.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.690
It's quite ghastly.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.540
The rats concur.

02:29.420 --> 02:34.410
So he says to me, "Arthur, I dunno
what's up with me windscreen,

02:34.460 --> 02:37.650
"it don't matter how much I
cleans it, it's like a fog."

02:37.700 --> 02:40.410
So I says, "Don't worry
about your windscreen.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.890
"It's your specs want cleaning."

02:41.940 --> 02:43.050
What a chump.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.900
He'll be back every week
now to get his specs washed.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.690
~ The last of the beef.
~ Where's mine then?

02:52.740 --> 02:55.740
You get spoiled enough, Dad.
Don't pretend different.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.570
How do you stay so clean in here?

02:58.620 --> 03:00.010
He don't do nothing, that's how.

03:00.060 --> 03:03.090
We don't all need to make a song
and dance of an oil change.

03:03.140 --> 03:05.290
I am a model professional.

03:05.340 --> 03:08.770
I like him clean and tidy, Dad,
so don't go upsetting me now.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.090
Not in my condition.

03:10.140 --> 03:12.530
Thought I might find
you here, Mrs Amos.

03:12.580 --> 03:15.050
If you don't mind, gentlemen,
charming as your garage is,

03:15.100 --> 03:18.290
it's not quite the environment we
recommend for our mothers-to-be.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.480
Can't stay away, can I?

03:22.620 --> 03:25.460
How are you getting on, Mrs Amos?

03:27.260 --> 03:30.690
~ Morning, Nurse Crane.
~ Baby at the surgery?

03:30.740 --> 03:32.970
Thank you for coming.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.850
I was called out to see
George Sitwell last night.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.410
He was in an appalling state,
delirious, high fever,

03:40.460 --> 03:44.090
dehydrated from diarrhoea, which
was bloody and full of pus.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.290
Dysentery.

03:45.340 --> 03:47.490
That's nine cases in two days.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.730
Campaign Fever's what
my father called it.

03:49.780 --> 03:52.370
Said it wiped out whole battalions.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.330
You've quarantined him, Dr Turner?

03:54.380 --> 03:57.210
Of course you have. Spreads
like margarine.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.810
Which is why he's quarantined.

03:58.860 --> 04:01.290
Sooner we spot it,
sooner we contain it.

04:01.340 --> 04:03.850
I'll notify the Ministry
of Health of each case.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.290
Perhaps you'd furnish me
with their telephone number?

04:06.340 --> 04:08.010
Nurse Crane, I simply wish you

04:08.060 --> 04:10.810
and all at Nonnatus
to be extra vigilant.

04:10.860 --> 04:13.970
Home visits, clinic -
we can't risk ignoring

04:14.020 --> 04:16.450
what might seem a simple
case of diarrhoea.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.810
We don't have the resources
to cope with an epidemic.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.530
Weekly visits now. We're
getting rather close.

04:22.580 --> 04:25.250
And I come bearing
gifts. Delivery pack.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.130
Needs to be kept somewhere spotlessly
clean and close at hand.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.120
The parlour then, Tony's
pride and joy.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.490
Tony bought it last week.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.290
He says it made him feel sad,

04:41.340 --> 04:44.970
the way she looks down like she
don't really want to be there.

04:45.020 --> 04:48.090
But the painter, well, he's
sort of making her be there,

04:48.140 --> 04:50.940
on account of how she's so beautiful.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.460
Imagine seeing all that in a picture.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.480
Pop it here, Nurse.

04:59.660 --> 05:02.050
I don't know what he's
on about half the time.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.940
But he loves this room to be just
so. Most chaps wouldn't care.

05:08.820 --> 05:10.290
Who plays?

05:10.340 --> 05:14.240
Tony'll take lessons, when
the garage's making enough.

05:14.460 --> 05:17.740
"A piano's the mark of a
gentleman," that's what he says.

05:20.980 --> 05:24.970
Well, do I need bed rest and waiting
on hand, foot and finger?

05:25.020 --> 05:27.360
Achingly normal, I'm afraid.

05:29.140 --> 05:30.940
Gently now, lads.

05:32.020 --> 05:34.970
More Paddies. Getting like lice.

05:35.020 --> 05:38.290
Ladies, if I might
have your attention.

05:38.340 --> 05:41.440
We have an outbreak of
dysentery in Poplar.

05:42.620 --> 05:47.290
Don't be alarmed. We can stop its
spread with very simple hygiene.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.890
Washing our hands.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.130
Are you saying we don't wash? Cheek.

05:51.180 --> 05:54.690
Mrs Turner is suggesting
you don't know your enemy.

05:54.740 --> 05:59.130
Poor hygiene and cramped conditions,
both of which aid its spread.

05:59.180 --> 06:06.490
Taking carbolic soap and hot water,
we soap up beyond the wrists.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.410
Nails are ideally short and neat.

06:09.460 --> 06:14.490
No nail brushes. Bacteria do
so enjoy a damp, dense home.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.880
I don't wish to hold you up.

06:17.700 --> 06:21.050
It's all right. I've
a good few minutes yet.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.040
Then perhaps you'd
distribute the soap?

06:27.260 --> 06:31.130
We have several bars of soap
here from our own supply.

06:31.180 --> 06:34.900
Not enough for everyone, I'm afraid,
only for those most in need.

06:37.340 --> 06:39.970
It's them meths drinkers.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.770
Hot weather brings 'em
out, the horrible lot.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.420
Thank you, but we're not in need.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.090
I know, I know, neither a nurse
or an expectant mother.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.090
Or an infant.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.450
I've just had a telephone
call from the rector.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.850
His wife had a fall last week.
She's broken her ankle.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.330
I'm very sorry to hear that.

06:59.380 --> 07:02.130
With rest it should heal,
usually about eight weeks.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.770
Mrs Hibbert was in charge
of the Rose Queen.

07:04.820 --> 07:07.650
Now she's out of action, the
rector wants me to take charge.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.570
Quite apart from the fact I don't have
a clue about this sort of thing,

07:10.620 --> 07:12.090
it's in two weeks.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.690
He even suggested I involve
you, as my fiance.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.530
I... I told him how busy you are...

07:17.580 --> 07:19.090
Organising the Rose Queen?

07:19.140 --> 07:21.570
Exactly. I'll tell him
it's out of the question.

07:21.620 --> 07:26.050
You'll do no such thing. It's been
part of Poplar for generations.

07:26.100 --> 07:29.370
I'm going to be your wife,
Tom, I want to support you.

07:29.420 --> 07:32.500
And, quite frankly, it'll make a
glorious change from giving enemas.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.930
Shoes off and up onto the bed.

07:36.980 --> 07:40.130
I won't be stopping, Nurse. Sure
I'm only here about the hospital.

07:40.180 --> 07:42.210
I'd like to have him
there, please God.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.260
We can discuss it all
at your home visit.

07:47.380 --> 07:50.180
You're in Menston Street, aren't you?

08:02.060 --> 08:05.060
If you'd raise your
dress up, Mrs McEvoy.

08:05.940 --> 08:07.740
The examination.

08:18.260 --> 08:21.850
You appear to have become the
prey of fleas, Mrs McEvoy.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.770
The lads took on a kitten.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.760
Try not to scratch.

08:31.620 --> 08:36.169
If I had one wish, it'd be she was
around to see her grandchild born.

08:36.220 --> 08:41.650
When I look at you and Marie, I
see Maureen and me 30 years ago.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.100
Keep it simple, son, life
don't get any better.

08:46.900 --> 08:50.810
You'll do all right,
you know. Fatherhood.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.010
Don't think I don't know
what's going on up there.

08:53.060 --> 08:54.850
It don't come natural to any man.

08:54.900 --> 08:58.060
Maureen said I held Marie like
she was the crown jewels.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.930
But sometimes I dunno
what comes natural.

09:02.980 --> 09:05.770
It's like I have to pinch
myself, you know,

09:05.820 --> 09:08.920
say "This is my house.
This is my... life."

09:09.860 --> 09:12.530
It's like I'm one of
them Little Green Men.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.930
And nothing outside the flying
saucer makes any sense.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.330
There. See? Thinking too much.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.120
Keep it simple.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.490
There does seem to be
rather a lot left to do.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.770
It appears that Mrs Hibbert
was rather more focused

09:25.820 --> 09:27.770
on note making for the Rose Queen.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.490
"The dresses and capes have
been under attack from moths,

09:30.540 --> 09:34.010
"but from a distance in a
poor light are passable."

09:34.060 --> 09:35.970
Not to me, Mrs Hibbert.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.420
In Pagan times the Rose
Queen was put to death.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.320
Anti-Pagan sentiment, of course.

09:43.300 --> 09:48.540
Nurse Franklin, your shoe receptacle
has gone to a most worthy cause.

09:50.700 --> 09:54.940
Board and lodgings, for those rats
surviving this extermination.

09:57.140 --> 10:00.650
Now, this year's Rose Queen is...

10:00.700 --> 10:04.210
Joan Musson, and she'll be crowned
by last year's queen who was,

10:04.260 --> 10:06.290
Marie Amos.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.900
Oh, there's going to be a little
more Rose Queen than I'd imagined.

10:24.460 --> 10:27.020
~ Oh, lads.
~ Dad, Dad!

10:28.500 --> 10:29.730
Good to see you.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.770
Did you miss your dad as
much as I've missed you?

10:31.820 --> 10:34.360
Don't be getting them dirty now.

10:38.380 --> 10:42.280
~ You not having any?
~ Sure I'm grand. I had some earlier.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.770
There'll be more at
the end of the week.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.930
I can't hold on, Dan. I can't.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.290
Don't be saying that now.

10:48.340 --> 10:52.370
It's too much. I want
us under the same roof.

10:52.420 --> 10:55.610
I feel so alone in that place.
They treat us like animals

10:55.660 --> 10:57.890
and I'm starting to believe
I'm no better than one.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.530
I promise you, soon.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.250
When? When?

11:01.300 --> 11:03.450
I'm doing everything I can.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.170
Put your trust in the Sacred Heart.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.570
I put my trust in you.

12:53.260 --> 12:56.000
No. For Christ's sake, look, look...

12:57.100 --> 12:58.730
I'm married. I've got
a baby on the way.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.970
~ I'm arresting you for...
~ It was a mistake, all right?

13:01.020 --> 13:02.210
I've got a... I've got a wife!

13:02.260 --> 13:05.260
~ Please, don't do this. Please!
~ I'm arresting you for Gross Indecency.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.540
Oh, God.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.610
The dress is going to have
to be rather forgiving,

13:20.660 --> 13:23.450
but I think we'll manage.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.730
I'll get it. I should
be going anyway.

13:25.780 --> 13:27.450
Thanks, Nurse.

13:30.450 --> 13:31.450
'Hello.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.050
'Trixie. I wasn't
expecting to see you.

13:34.100 --> 13:38.250
'I'm here to see Mrs Amos.
Her husband's been arrested.'

13:38.300 --> 13:42.050
Mrs Amos, please sit down. Sergeant
Noakes needs to speak to you.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.440
Police?

13:44.620 --> 13:46.490
Try not to worry, Mrs Amos.

13:46.540 --> 13:47.890
I'm here about your husband.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.570
Oh, God, he ain't hurt?
Tell me he ain't hurt.

13:50.620 --> 13:53.160
He's been... He's been arrested.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.890
We found your husband in a...

13:56.940 --> 13:59.250
In a compromising situation.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.570
What are you talking about?

14:01.620 --> 14:04.490
We caught him committing
an indecent act.

14:04.540 --> 14:08.210
What's he saying?
What's it even mean?

14:08.260 --> 14:11.860
Mrs Amos, I'm afraid your husband
was caught with another man.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.890
He's at the police station. He'll
go before the Magistrate tomorrow.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.940
If a surety can be given, Mr Amos
will be able to return home.

14:20.020 --> 14:23.730
Is there someone who
could pledge the money?

14:23.780 --> 14:26.940
He don't get paid till Friday,
I've already shopped...

14:30.060 --> 14:32.410
He wouldn't do that.

14:32.460 --> 14:34.050
He's not that way.

14:34.100 --> 14:37.170
Mrs Amos, could I fetch someone?

14:37.220 --> 14:38.530
Someone who could help?

14:38.580 --> 14:40.740
My dad. I want my dad.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.050
Well, I still think your
timing was quite awful.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.970
We've had complaints about
that gentlemen's convenience.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.730
That's why we put in
the Pretty Police.

15:10.780 --> 15:12.250
Their job's to smoke out his type.

15:12.300 --> 15:15.250
A honey trap? And now
he'll go to prison.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.610
It is a crime, Nurse Mount.

15:16.660 --> 15:18.850
Mrs Amos is about to have her baby.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.650
Your heart breaks
for her, doesn't it?

15:20.700 --> 15:22.210
I wonder if she'll forgive him.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.460
~ Could you?
~ Not a chance.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.130
Because of what he is?

15:27.180 --> 15:28.530
Because he's cheated.

15:28.580 --> 15:32.650
I couldn't care less who with and
I certainly don't mind "Frauleins".

15:32.700 --> 15:37.130
In fact, I provided diversionary
cover for one during my training.

15:37.180 --> 15:40.570
A young doctor - melting to look
at, but the other way inclined.

15:40.620 --> 15:43.090
Perfect gentleman. Sadly.

15:43.140 --> 15:46.610
Without me on his arm, he would
have lost his position.

15:46.660 --> 15:50.090
It's the same for nurses. They
told us the day we enrolled.

15:50.140 --> 15:53.050
Quite. "No dark secrets, girls".

15:53.100 --> 15:55.440
Not if you value your life.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.810
Couldn't sleep all
night for worrying.

16:06.860 --> 16:08.770
I hope you told 'em
we won't stand for it.

16:08.820 --> 16:12.010
~ Going around arresting decent men.
~ Marie, please.

16:12.060 --> 16:15.010
Cos it ain't true, is it?
What the copper said?

16:15.060 --> 16:17.600
I don't want him near my garage.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.370
What you tell people about the
trial, that's your business.

16:21.420 --> 16:23.760
They won't hear it from me.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.170
Trial?

16:27.220 --> 16:30.320
I go before the Quarter
Sessions next week.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.290
The Quarter Sessions?

16:34.340 --> 16:36.090
You're going to end up in prison.

16:36.140 --> 16:37.370
No!

16:37.420 --> 16:39.490
No, look, they said I can
have someone, all right?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.090
Someone to speak up for me in Court,

16:41.140 --> 16:43.890
a witness to say I'm
of good character.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.810
I don't want you telling anyone.

16:46.860 --> 16:51.140
And who'll speak up for you,
when they know what you've done?

16:57.180 --> 16:58.930
Treasure hunt?

16:58.980 --> 17:01.570
I thought if we could plot the
geography of the dysentery,

17:01.620 --> 17:03.570
we'd be better placed to stop it.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.810
Surely with Nurse Crane
on the warpath,

17:05.859 --> 17:07.730
dysentery doesn't stand a chance.

17:07.780 --> 17:10.930
All the cases must
be linked in some way.

17:10.980 --> 17:14.569
It's not waterborne like cholera,
human contact spreads it.

17:14.619 --> 17:18.020
There's a cluster around
the Moffat Road School.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.010
Mr Sitwell, the lock
keeper, has no children.

17:21.060 --> 17:25.290
No. And as you can see, I'm
beginning my investigation.

17:25.339 --> 17:29.530
I thought I might assist you
in the manner of a Dr Watson.

17:29.580 --> 17:32.580
~ Watson always had the last word.
~ Did he?

17:41.860 --> 17:44.770
I'm looking for Mrs McEvoy at 4.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.730
I'm 4. I ain't no McEvoy.

17:46.780 --> 17:49.520
No Irish here. It's a decent street.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.220
Midwife calling.

18:02.020 --> 18:03.820
Morning, morning!

18:07.140 --> 18:09.650
Shall we see what baby's up to?

18:09.700 --> 18:13.010
Perhaps the sofa would
be more comfortable?

18:13.060 --> 18:15.130
Mrs Amos?

18:15.180 --> 18:19.090
Fiddliest job of the week.
Dust gets everywhere.

18:19.140 --> 18:22.380
If only we could learn to love dust.
Think how much time it would save.

18:28.020 --> 18:34.580
Mrs Amos, my work... It's about
caring, for baby and for you.

18:35.940 --> 18:40.100
So anything that affects you is
a concern of mine, do you see?

18:41.460 --> 18:43.690
Then I can't be upset, can I, Nurse?

18:43.740 --> 18:46.410
Cos that's bad for me and the baby.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.460
Achingly normal?

18:53.940 --> 18:56.650
See? Everything's all right, Nurse.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.840
Everything's all right.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.130
But if it weren't...

19:02.180 --> 19:04.890
you know you could
talk to me, don't you?

19:04.940 --> 19:07.770
Tony ain't what the
Sergeant says he is.

19:07.820 --> 19:09.820
He ain't one of them.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.160
I couldn't've fallen...

19:12.900 --> 19:17.620
Couldn't've loved someone like
that, someone so unnatural.

19:20.380 --> 19:23.940
~ You see that, don't you?
~ Of course, Mrs Amos.

19:26.740 --> 19:30.410
Would you check the records for
Mrs McEvoy when you get a moment?

19:30.460 --> 19:33.810
I had her pegged at 4 Menston Street.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.370
That's the one.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.090
Not according to its occupant.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.890
I certainly thought I'd taken
down the address correctly.

19:39.940 --> 19:43.130
I'm always very careful,
especially with an accent.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.210
I did double check.

19:44.260 --> 19:47.730
Your proficiency is not in
any way in doubt, Mrs Turner.

19:47.780 --> 19:51.170
No, I believe we've been
given a false address.

19:51.220 --> 19:53.690
~ Why ever?
~ Exactly my concern.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.210
Just a little longer, lads.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.210
It'll be seven before ye know it

20:03.260 --> 20:06.060
and we can all go inside and tuck up.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.780
Please, God.

20:14.140 --> 20:16.170
Barbara?

20:16.220 --> 20:18.490
Would my undying gratitude
and a slice of cake

20:18.540 --> 20:21.480
keep you at the Singer
a little longer?

20:21.900 --> 20:24.930
What's one more? Of course.
And no need for cake.

20:24.980 --> 20:27.980
Nonsense. There's always
a need for cake.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.690
(I'm in love with you.)

20:30.740 --> 20:34.130
I should think so, too. Barbara's
banners need threading on those and

20:34.180 --> 20:37.380
then you can come and
find me in the kitchen.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.810
Are we expecting a visitor
of excessive proportions?

20:52.860 --> 20:55.050
I'm measuring up.

20:55.100 --> 20:58.330
I need to know how many sandbags
it'll take to block up this

20:58.380 --> 21:01.850
doorway and keep us safe, in
the event they press the button.

21:01.900 --> 21:04.890
All this energy on sheltering
would be put to better

21:04.940 --> 21:06.970
use in talks of peace!

21:07.020 --> 21:11.530
With the Commies? Can't
trust a word they say.

21:11.580 --> 21:17.530
~ What are you doing?
~ Sweeping the poison.
I don't hold with culls.

21:17.580 --> 21:22.250
~ Who knows which undesirable
will be purged next?!
~ Hear, hear!

21:22.300 --> 21:25.690
You'd think we were killing kittens!

21:25.740 --> 21:28.930
Well, I'm sorry you
can't help me, too!

21:28.980 --> 21:31.890
Good afternoon!

21:31.940 --> 21:34.170
~ No luck, Nurse Crane?
~ No, Sister.

21:34.220 --> 21:37.490
I'm starting to wonder if
I imagined Dolores McEvoy.

21:37.540 --> 21:39.290
I can't find her anywhere.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.410
Then, you must wait for her to
come to you, which given her

21:42.460 --> 21:44.930
condition is surely inevitable.

21:46.420 --> 21:49.090
I could just about take it.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.930
Prison. I mean,

21:50.980 --> 21:52.970
Marie - it'd be too much.

21:53.020 --> 21:57.490
I'll call in. I could
prescribe a sedative.

21:57.540 --> 21:59.050
Might just take the edge off.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.970
I can't go inside.

22:01.980 --> 22:05.730
Look, my brief, he says I can have
someone speak up for me in court.

22:05.780 --> 22:09.620
You know, say I've got my
qualities. Please, Doctor.

22:11.740 --> 22:13.540
Will you help me?

22:14.700 --> 22:17.240
Marie, she won't take the shame.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.210
Me dying'd be better.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.330
Don't talk that way.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.530
You are not a bad man.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.420
Remember that.

22:27.700 --> 22:31.610
~ I'm never going to have what I want.
~ You're part of a family.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.810
About to be a father.

22:33.860 --> 22:36.690
Hold on to the good in that.

22:36.740 --> 22:39.840
Sometimes I can't even
wait to go to sleep.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.360
Just so I can dream.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.880
I can have what I want in my dreams.

22:49.780 --> 22:52.180
Let's look to the court case.

22:53.420 --> 22:56.530
I will vouch as to your character.

22:56.580 --> 22:59.660
Though I can't promise
it will make a difference.

23:02.380 --> 23:06.810
They seemed such a perfect couple.
Mr Amos is so very handsome.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.890
Don't make that your
criteria for men.

23:09.940 --> 23:12.490
My mother always said,
"Find a plain man.

23:12.540 --> 23:15.530
"He'll be eternally grateful
and never stray."

23:15.580 --> 23:19.850
I always thought the essence of crime
is that some harm is done to someone.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.730
You might try putting yourself
in Mrs Amos' shoes.

23:22.780 --> 23:25.850
Fornication too was once a crime.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.210
Punishable by stoning.

23:29.260 --> 23:33.050
Perhaps we could stone Mr Amos.

23:33.100 --> 23:37.140
Sister Monica Joan, sodomy is a sin.

23:38.620 --> 23:41.090
God himself tells us it's a sin.

23:41.140 --> 23:44.770
Well, quite frankly, I thought
we'd fought a war over fascism.

23:44.820 --> 23:47.370
And that's what this is.

23:47.420 --> 23:51.410
~ Telling people who they can and can't love.
~ Love?!

23:51.460 --> 23:53.770
A judge will try Mr Amos, not us.

23:53.820 --> 23:56.820
Nurse Mount, will you
pass the piccalilli?

24:02.460 --> 24:05.650
There'll soon be more
patches than trousers!

24:05.700 --> 24:08.370
Still, at least Tim's adventurous.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.130
Patrick...

24:11.180 --> 24:15.450
.. you'll think me naive, but
how can Mr Amos be that way?

24:15.500 --> 24:18.170
He's married. His wife's pregnant.

24:19.300 --> 24:22.220
I suppose it's how we've made things.

24:24.420 --> 24:27.770
A man gets married, he has a family.

24:27.820 --> 24:30.820
There isn't much room
for a different way.

24:32.020 --> 24:34.930
~ Do you know many others?
~ I have done.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.370
From the war, really.

24:37.420 --> 24:41.450
Throw enough men together
and you'll find every type.

24:41.500 --> 24:45.460
Kinsey's report says a good deal
of men have had homosexual thoughts.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.890
A good deal of men.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.880
What do you believe?

24:52.980 --> 24:55.580
That we should live and let live.

24:58.740 --> 25:02.930
Dr Turner. He's going to
speak for me at court.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.180
He's going to help us.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.650
Well, they'll listen
to him, won't they?

25:09.700 --> 25:11.500
He's upstanding.

25:12.340 --> 25:16.170
He'll make them see you
just made a mistake.

25:16.220 --> 25:18.850
Every man's allowed one mistake.

25:18.900 --> 25:21.440
And it was just once, wasn't it?

25:34.300 --> 25:37.810
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.

25:37.860 --> 25:39.490
I'm sorry?

25:39.540 --> 25:41.810
Bulthorpe women's hostel?

25:41.860 --> 25:44.530
I don't believe we have
anyone registered.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.090
In labour, you say?

25:46.140 --> 25:48.810
Hello?

25:48.860 --> 25:52.130
~ A woman in labour at Bulthorpe?
~ You're familiar with it?

25:52.180 --> 25:54.930
~ I thought it had closed down.
~ Apparently not.

25:54.980 --> 25:58.050
~ If you point me in the direction...
~ I'm coming with you.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.240
I think you'll need me.

26:04.540 --> 26:08.090
Thank you... for speaking for him.

26:08.140 --> 26:10.930
They'll see he's sick, won't they?

26:10.980 --> 26:14.140
They'll see a good man,
Mrs Amos. That's my hope.

26:15.380 --> 26:19.100
And he's first up. Means
there won't be a crowd in.

26:20.220 --> 26:22.410
Ooh, that's a good sign, isn't it?

26:22.460 --> 26:24.260
Let's go through.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.850
'Anthony Luke Amos,

26:30.900 --> 26:34.610
'you're charged under Section 32 of

26:34.660 --> 26:38.010
'the Sexual Offences Act of 1956'

26:38.060 --> 26:41.610
that on the 24th of May you
did persistently importune

26:41.660 --> 26:45.970
a man in a public place
for an immoral purpose.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.650
That is to say,

26:47.700 --> 26:52.370
for the purpose of committing
acts of a homosexual nature.

26:52.420 --> 26:53.610
How do you plead?

26:53.660 --> 26:55.810
Guilty, sir.

26:55.860 --> 26:58.210
Sit down, Mr Amos.

26:58.260 --> 27:00.600
Witness for the prosecution.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.210
Sergeant Noakes.

27:03.260 --> 27:05.210
H Division.

27:05.260 --> 27:07.300
Ahem.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.730
It was the night of
the 24th of May, 8pm,

27:10.780 --> 27:13.690
in the gentleman's convenience
on Laneside Road.

27:13.740 --> 27:15.650
It's what we call a cottage, sir.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.450
A place where the homosexuals
frequent in order to

27:18.500 --> 27:20.770
engage in immoral acts.

27:20.820 --> 27:23.730
We'd had several complaints
from members of the public

27:23.780 --> 27:25.690
about activity there.

27:25.740 --> 27:29.970
The defendant made sexual advances
to my colleague, Constable Jamieson,

27:30.020 --> 27:34.260
and on my arrival, I witnessed the
defendant in a state of undress.

27:45.380 --> 27:49.450
Miss Ginson, you gave us very little
information in your telephone

27:49.500 --> 27:53.170
call, including the name
of the woman in question.

27:53.220 --> 27:56.690
I'm just on shift. All
I know is she's an Irish.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.290
Oh, and she's bad
sick with something.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.880
Hope you ain't the queasy types.

28:03.860 --> 28:05.810
Whatever is this place?

28:05.860 --> 28:09.090
A cheap lodging house that should
have been condemned with the slums.

28:09.140 --> 28:12.930
We're a boarding house, women only,
giving shelter to them without.

28:12.980 --> 28:16.180
Hardly giving. You're
charging three and six!

28:18.580 --> 28:20.490
Mrs McEvoy.

28:20.540 --> 28:24.930
Well, you've given us the merry
run-around, haven't you?

28:24.980 --> 28:27.650
I've telephoned half of
Poplar looking for you.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.210
This is not our home.

28:29.260 --> 28:32.130
It's just till my husband
gets us on our feet.

28:32.180 --> 28:34.650
You've nothing to explain.

28:34.700 --> 28:38.090
Please, nurse. I haven't
had a chance to wash.

28:38.140 --> 28:40.690
We need to see what stage you're at.

28:40.740 --> 28:43.450
Dysentery.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.050
Well, what have we got here?

28:46.100 --> 28:49.210
Know anyone who likes barley sugars?

28:49.260 --> 28:52.170
Be good lads and wait downstairs.

28:52.220 --> 28:54.810
We'll look after mother now.

28:56.580 --> 29:00.450
And do you consider Mr Amos to
be a man of integrity, Dr Turner?

29:00.500 --> 29:04.210
~ Without doubt, sir.
~ Surely, not quite without doubt.

29:04.260 --> 29:07.410
He serves our community tirelessly
through his work with

29:07.460 --> 29:09.010
the Civil Defence Corps.

29:09.060 --> 29:12.890
His character in private, Dr Turner,
that is of greater interest.

29:12.940 --> 29:16.250
Mr Amos has a young wife
about to give birth.

29:16.300 --> 29:19.410
Throughout her confinement,
he's shown great support.

29:19.460 --> 29:23.810
Surely, by his own admission,
that support is not consistent.

29:23.860 --> 29:26.810
Mr Amos badly wants
to become a father

29:26.860 --> 29:29.210
and to put this incident behind him.

29:29.260 --> 29:32.740
~ I urge you to consider the...
~ You "urge" me, Dr Turner?

29:34.060 --> 29:37.050
You are here to provide a
reference as to the character

29:37.100 --> 29:41.530
of the defendant, who himself
admits to this lewd act.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.210
Forgive me, sir.

29:43.260 --> 29:48.930
I simply meant to say that Mr Amos
is a man who wants to change.

29:48.980 --> 29:52.570
And the treatment available
could help that change.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.250
The brutality of prison
would be a terrible...

29:55.300 --> 29:59.170
Dr Turner, must I remind
you again of your role here?

29:59.220 --> 30:01.140
Stand down.

30:03.980 --> 30:07.130
Dolores, you're suffering
from dysentery.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.810
It's why you're feeling so ghastly.

30:09.860 --> 30:13.850
The cramps have masked your
contractions. Your labour's advanced.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.210
~ We need hot water.
~ Hot's been off all week.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.890
~ Perhaps you'd boil a kettle.
~ Run around after the likes of her?

30:18.940 --> 30:21.810
~ Who do you think I am?
~ Someone who seems to care very little.

30:21.860 --> 30:25.010
See to that water, would you?

30:25.060 --> 30:27.890
We need to move her to the
London after she's delivered.

30:27.940 --> 30:31.240
You carry on here, I'll
telephone the surgery.

30:32.180 --> 30:34.320
The defendant will rise.

30:37.060 --> 30:40.770
Anthony Luke Amos, you admit
to an act of sexual perversion

30:40.820 --> 30:42.530
and moral corruption.

30:42.580 --> 30:44.970
This is an offence which carries

30:45.020 --> 30:48.650
a maximum sentence of
two years' imprisonment.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.410
Your doctor sees in you
something I do not -

30:51.460 --> 30:54.290
a man who wishes to be cured.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.570
In my view, the imposition
of the maximum

30:56.620 --> 31:00.410
sentence in your case would
be entirely justified.

31:00.460 --> 31:03.460
On your feet! I haven't
finished, Mr Amos.

31:07.500 --> 31:11.330
On this occasion, however, I am
willing to make a probation order,

31:11.380 --> 31:15.740
on the condition that you consent
to treatment until you are cured.

31:17.380 --> 31:21.570
You will pay the costs of this court
and a fine in the sum of Â£15.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.730
Thank you.

31:23.780 --> 31:25.330
Thank you, sir.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.740
Thank your doctor, Mr Amos.

31:28.780 --> 31:32.370
I need you to make an appointment
at my surgery for this evening.

31:32.420 --> 31:35.170
~ About the baby?
~ To discuss the treatment.

31:35.220 --> 31:39.810
There are implications, side-effects
you'll need to know about.

31:39.860 --> 31:42.060
Then we'll see you later.

31:46.180 --> 31:49.930
~ I can't.
~ Come on.

31:49.980 --> 31:53.770
~ I can't do no more.
~ Oh, yes, you can.
~ Forgive me, I can't.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.970
You have to! You have to push now!

31:57.020 --> 31:59.330
Can't!

31:59.380 --> 32:03.930
My own, boil washed. Clean as you
can get, for when the baby comes.

32:03.980 --> 32:07.650
Dolores, come on now.
You need to push.

32:07.700 --> 32:10.090
Where is your husband?
Where is he living?

32:10.140 --> 32:12.010
A seamen's hostel.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.330
Shad Thames.

32:13.380 --> 32:15.930
Do you know it? Can you
find it, bring him here?

32:15.980 --> 32:18.290
Men ain't allowed here.
Rules is rules.

32:18.340 --> 32:22.650
Superintendent Ginson, you've given us cause
to believe you have a heart after all.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.810
Don't disappoint us in our
diagnosis. Find him! Please!

32:25.860 --> 32:29.690
~ Dolores, you want your husband
to see baby, don't you?
~ Yes!

32:29.740 --> 32:33.170
Whatever strength you have, I
need it now! I need you to push!

32:33.220 --> 32:34.820
~ Urgh!
~ Good!

32:36.820 --> 32:39.770
Now, gently. That's it, that's it.

32:39.820 --> 32:42.570
Urgh!

32:42.620 --> 32:44.940
That's it.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.700
Well done!

32:50.940 --> 32:52.530
A daughter, Dolores.

32:52.580 --> 32:54.810
~ You have a daughter.
~ A daughter!

32:54.860 --> 32:56.450
Oh!

32:56.500 --> 32:58.450
Oh, she's beautiful!

32:58.500 --> 32:59.690
Isn't she?

32:59.740 --> 33:01.940
Time to meet your mother.

33:04.460 --> 33:08.380
Viewing only, I'm afraid, just until
we've treated your dysentery.

33:11.500 --> 33:14.610
Don't look. Don't
look at any of this.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.650
This is not your home. I promise you.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.640
Yes, I promise you.

33:23.380 --> 33:27.210
You will be prescribed
Stilbestrol by the hospital.

33:27.260 --> 33:30.450
You will be allowed to take this,
largely in the privacy of your

33:30.500 --> 33:35.890
own home, but you will be monitored
to make sure you're taking it.

33:35.940 --> 33:40.810
There are other treatments.
ECT, aversion therapy,

33:40.860 --> 33:44.890
but I'd say this is less
brutal and more private.

33:44.940 --> 33:49.250
That's all right. You're not
funny about tablets, are you?

33:49.300 --> 33:54.130
They contain a form of
oestrogen, the female hormone.

33:54.180 --> 33:57.970
It will stop your body from
producing testosterone,

33:58.020 --> 34:02.890
which in turn will
suppress your urges.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.610
But he'll be all right, otherwise?

34:07.340 --> 34:11.850
Impotence occurs, as the
testosterone reduces.

34:11.900 --> 34:15.489
We'll already have
our child. Is that it?

34:15.540 --> 34:18.010
There may also be gynecomastia.

34:19.219 --> 34:22.530
Development of breast tissue.

34:22.580 --> 34:26.179
There is often a loss
of muscle and body hair.

34:27.620 --> 34:29.460
Dear God...

34:30.739 --> 34:34.260
Well, it's not prison. And
that's all that matters.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.020
Daniel...

35:14.300 --> 35:18.380
Perhaps father can hold baby,
just until you can, Dolores.

35:20.100 --> 35:23.020
Daddy...

35:38.700 --> 35:41.060
All this... Forgive me.

35:43.260 --> 35:46.540
You must think us fools. Coming
over here with nothing.

35:48.060 --> 35:51.940
I was promised a good job. I didn't
mean us to end up like we have.

35:55.180 --> 35:58.370
There's just so landlords
who will let to Irish.

35:58.420 --> 36:01.360
They have us down with
blacks and dogs.

36:04.140 --> 36:08.780
But I will work ever hour I
can to make us decent again.

36:11.060 --> 36:13.050
She's a beauty, isn't she?

36:13.100 --> 36:14.970
Her whole life ahead of her.

36:15.020 --> 36:20.250
~ Plenty of time to get it all right.
~ Yes.

36:20.300 --> 36:23.820
You don't have no choice. You've
got to take them tablets.

36:30.340 --> 36:33.370
They're giving me women's hormones.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.650
Don't you understand?

36:35.700 --> 36:37.810
I won't be the same.

36:37.860 --> 36:41.900
I don't want you to be
the same. Enough, Tony!

36:44.620 --> 36:47.220
We've got to forget all this now.

36:48.860 --> 36:51.370
It's a new start.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.140
Please!

37:00.060 --> 37:01.810
I'll follow on to The London

37:01.860 --> 37:04.490
and make sure all's
well with Mrs McEvoy.

37:04.540 --> 37:08.050
Really, Dr Turner, eating in
a place as filthy as this!

37:08.100 --> 37:10.530
It's been a long day, Nurse Crane.

37:10.580 --> 37:14.250
The hospital has agreed to admit the
boys, technically for observation,

37:14.300 --> 37:15.970
until the mother's recovered.

37:16.020 --> 37:19.370
And you're happy for them to
return to this infernal place?

37:19.420 --> 37:23.850
~ I can't do any more.
~ This hostel belongs in the past!

37:23.900 --> 37:27.650
Resources are limited and we
must manage as best we can.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.900
And the people who cannot manage?
You've pie on your collar.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.250
Seeing as we're quarantined together,

37:36.300 --> 37:38.930
how about you test me on my Spanish?

37:38.980 --> 37:41.170
I'm rather enjoying my magazine.

37:41.220 --> 37:45.060
We've two days of this. It'll
still be there later.

37:52.300 --> 37:56.090
I am Mrs Gonzales. I live in Madrid.

37:56.140 --> 38:00.210
Yo soy la Senora Gonzalez.

38:00.260 --> 38:03.050
Yo vivo en Madrid.

38:03.100 --> 38:07.530
Very good! I didn't expect
such Latin flair!

38:07.580 --> 38:11.490
It's a great desire of mine
to go to Spain one day.

38:11.540 --> 38:13.730
Another one?

38:13.780 --> 38:16.380
Helps me through a difficult day.

38:16.980 --> 38:19.290
Do you need that much help?

38:19.340 --> 38:22.850
Perhaps there's a phrase for
it - it's none of your concern.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.450
You're quite right.

38:24.500 --> 38:28.410
How many Camparis you have
is entirely your business.

38:28.460 --> 38:31.730
Family history caught
up with me. An aunt.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.450
Always claimed she
was a social drinker.

38:34.500 --> 38:37.500
Whereas I've never claimed
to be anything.

38:39.580 --> 38:43.530
Didn't imagine you'd be here.

38:43.580 --> 38:46.730
Why ever not? Everything's
just as it was, Nurse Mount.

38:46.780 --> 38:49.090
I'm relieved for you.

38:49.140 --> 38:51.810
For both of you.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.730
~ Eileen, do me up, would you?
~ 'Course.

38:56.260 --> 38:58.410
Let the papier mache commence.

38:58.460 --> 39:01.610
I thought I'd get the children
on to making leaves and flowers.

39:01.660 --> 39:04.490
Is this your style? Coming in at
the end and doing the fun bits?

39:04.540 --> 39:06.730
Sounds wonderful.

39:06.780 --> 39:11.610
Children. Who would like to help
Reverend Hereward make papier mache?

39:11.660 --> 39:15.610
~ Which is French for chewed paper.
~ Can we eat it then, Miss?
~ No.

39:15.660 --> 39:19.170
Volunteers with a degree of
responsibility more than welcome.

39:19.220 --> 39:22.330
I'll bribe you with the East
London Advertiser, out today.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.250
Very good.

39:24.300 --> 39:26.850
That's it, boys.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.900
Keep the pole still,
we're not waving flags.

39:31.180 --> 39:33.690
What a Rose Queen you've been.

39:33.740 --> 39:36.690
Marie, would you take Joan's
arm through the parade?

39:36.740 --> 39:41.330
It will provide some stability
in the absence of her spectacles.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.690
Girls, if you'd fall
in behind, two by two,

39:43.740 --> 39:46.410
flower girls will be on each side.

39:47.340 --> 39:49.610
Cubs behind, with banners.

39:51.740 --> 39:54.280
Thank you. You've saved the day.

39:56.300 --> 39:59.090
He's a flamin' queer!

39:59.140 --> 40:03.290
Seen this, Your Majesty?
Your secret's out now!

40:03.340 --> 40:05.850
~ What secret?
~ It says it here!

40:05.900 --> 40:07.970
Her fella! He's a homo!

40:08.020 --> 40:10.370
And you acting like
butter wouldn't melt!

40:10.420 --> 40:13.370
She ain't bringing that
filth to the Rose Queen!

40:13.420 --> 40:16.160
In front of decent people, children!

40:18.100 --> 40:19.450
Marie...

40:19.500 --> 40:22.530
That's it! You go and you stay gone!

40:22.580 --> 40:24.770
And you keep him away too!

40:24.820 --> 40:28.050
~ Marie has every right to be here!
~ Married to a man like that?!

40:28.100 --> 40:30.770
That type's got no place
at a church festival!

40:30.820 --> 40:33.490
Small-mindedness has no place here!

40:34.780 --> 40:36.770
Marie, this will all blow over.

40:36.820 --> 40:40.410
You heard what she said,
what she called him.

40:40.460 --> 40:43.010
I've got to live round them people.

40:43.060 --> 40:45.730
I can't go somewhere, I can't hide.

40:46.140 --> 40:48.410
How could he?

40:48.460 --> 40:50.400
How could he, Nurse?

41:04.260 --> 41:06.810
A word, old son.

41:06.860 --> 41:10.330
You know you can't be part
of this any more, don't you?

41:10.380 --> 41:12.490
What?

41:12.540 --> 41:15.210
Sergeant Noakes told me.

41:15.260 --> 41:20.290
And prison or no prison, you know
the CDC can't have criminals!

41:20.340 --> 41:21.890
I need to be here, Fred.

41:21.940 --> 41:25.050
I ain't got the garage, all right?
I've got to have something.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.770
If it was down to me, but it ain't.

41:29.460 --> 41:32.650
'We are living in an era
where we must make careful

41:32.700 --> 41:35.900
'decisions on who can
and cannot be trusted.'

41:37.780 --> 41:41.810
All right, Marie! What are you doing?

41:41.860 --> 41:44.610
They wouldn't let me in the
Rose Queen because of you!

41:44.660 --> 41:46.860
They put it in the paper!

41:48.540 --> 41:50.490
Oh, God. I'm sorry!

41:50.540 --> 41:53.730
You know what my mum said when
I first brought you home?

41:53.780 --> 41:56.370
A man can be too clean, that was it!

41:56.420 --> 42:00.690
Every other fella smelt of his
own sweat and dirt, but not you!

42:00.740 --> 42:03.090
You smelt nice.

42:03.140 --> 42:05.250
Like lemons.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.170
And I loved it.

42:07.220 --> 42:09.010
I thought I'd found my prince!

42:09.060 --> 42:10.810
I wanted to be!

42:10.860 --> 42:15.330
You're like this bloody
parlour! One big lie!

42:15.380 --> 42:19.250
You can't even kiss me
without closing your eyes!

42:19.300 --> 42:21.330
You think I don't see that?

42:21.380 --> 42:24.490
You've ruined us!

42:24.540 --> 42:29.010
For that man I wouldn't
have looked twice at! Why?

42:29.060 --> 42:32.420
~ Why him?
~ Because I wanted him!

42:35.780 --> 42:38.930
And I hate myself for it.

42:41.180 --> 42:42.860
And I'm sorry.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.730
I'm so sorry.

42:47.780 --> 42:49.700
Look...

42:50.700 --> 42:54.620
.. I will go somewhere. All right?
It'll be better for you without me.

42:57.060 --> 43:00.050
Better for me?!

43:00.100 --> 43:02.490
We're married!

43:02.540 --> 43:04.940
We've got a baby to bring up.

43:06.620 --> 43:09.770
So, you be a man now, Tony!

43:09.820 --> 43:15.380
You take your punishment and you get
cured cos you ain't going anywhere.

43:25.100 --> 43:28.770
~ Am I the only one who doesn't despise them?
~ Who?

43:28.820 --> 43:30.970
The queers.

43:31.020 --> 43:34.050
Of course not. I just don't think
it's our battle to fight.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.770
Who will, then?

43:36.820 --> 43:39.610
Patsy the Rose Queen.
It's important to Tom.

43:39.660 --> 43:41.970
He's been entrusted
with it by the Rector.

43:42.020 --> 43:45.730
I want it to go well for him. That
means without a dreadful commotion.

43:45.780 --> 43:48.770
~ I thought it was mother and baby first.
~ And it is.

43:48.820 --> 43:53.220
~ And Marie will have every care we can give.
~ Just... not in public.

43:55.860 --> 43:58.000
Why do you care so much?

44:00.340 --> 44:02.930
Perhaps I'm like Sister Monica Joan.

44:02.980 --> 44:05.980
Perhaps I don't hold
with culls either.

44:28.380 --> 44:30.370
You going, then?

44:30.420 --> 44:32.530
To the hospital?

44:32.580 --> 44:34.300
For the cure.

44:38.900 --> 44:40.930
I know from Mrs Turner
how busy you are,

44:40.980 --> 44:42.890
so I doubt this is a social call.

44:42.940 --> 44:45.810
The dreadful living conditions
at Bulthorpe Hospital have come

44:45.860 --> 44:47.250
to my attention.

44:47.300 --> 44:51.010
~ I'm going to petition Andrew
Lancing about it today.
~ The medical officer?

44:51.060 --> 44:53.130
Something needs to be done.

44:53.180 --> 44:55.130
I could do with some support.

44:55.180 --> 44:58.930
Lancing's decent enough
but has skin like a rhino.

44:58.980 --> 45:01.650
I wish I could help, but
I'm in Chichester overnight,

45:01.700 --> 45:04.040
visiting Sister Evangelina.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.650
But I know Nurse Crane would
be delighted to assist.

45:14.820 --> 45:17.570
Have you seen the squalor
these women live in?

45:17.620 --> 45:20.130
I'm not familiar with every boarding
house in the East End.

45:20.180 --> 45:21.610
Perhaps you should be.

45:21.660 --> 45:23.530
The conditions are Dickensian.

45:23.580 --> 45:27.250
I have to be strategic in
terms of time and resources.

45:27.300 --> 45:28.570
I can't help you.

45:28.620 --> 45:32.050
Ah, Mr Lancing, I feel
great sympathy for you.

45:32.100 --> 45:36.370
Well, I don't wish to elicit
pity, but, yes, it is difficult.

45:36.420 --> 45:40.650
It's so easy for Dr Turner,
not constrained by politics.

45:40.700 --> 45:44.970
His only agenda is care
for those most in need.

45:45.020 --> 45:49.090
Whereas you must ignore
and turn away from women

45:49.140 --> 45:54.570
and children in conditions
we would find hard to imagine.

45:54.620 --> 45:56.850
You poor devil.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.570
How do you manage your conscience?

46:02.420 --> 46:04.760
I'll arrange an inspection.

46:05.780 --> 46:10.290
Quarantine all those with dysentery,
have the place fogged,

46:10.340 --> 46:13.500
but Bulthorpe will exist
as long as poverty does.

46:16.140 --> 46:17.890
Knew what she was getting into.

46:17.940 --> 46:19.680
(She's coming.)

46:38.500 --> 46:41.580
Ah! Oh!

46:59.660 --> 47:01.810
You see what they wrote on my door?

47:01.860 --> 47:03.770
None of that matters now.

47:03.820 --> 47:06.820
Too late to get you
upstairs, I'm afraid.

47:25.660 --> 47:27.130
I feel scared.

47:27.180 --> 47:30.180
Don't be. You're doing
wonderfully, Marie.

47:44.500 --> 47:46.840
Light breaths now, with me.

47:55.140 --> 47:57.730
I want Tony, he's at the hospital.

47:57.780 --> 47:59.850
I want him to be here.

48:12.180 --> 48:14.930
Gently now, gently.

48:14.980 --> 48:18.650
Almost there, that's it.

48:18.700 --> 48:20.250
That's it.

48:20.300 --> 48:22.970
Almost there.

48:31.540 --> 48:33.450
How does a daughter sound?

48:33.500 --> 48:35.170
Oh, like that!

48:42.140 --> 48:43.940
She's beautiful.

48:47.140 --> 48:49.020
Well done.

49:06.740 --> 49:08.970
No!

49:09.020 --> 49:11.360
You got a daughter. Come on!

49:13.620 --> 49:16.330
I ain't pretending to
understand what you done.

49:16.380 --> 49:19.570
But you've made a mistake.
You can come back from it.

49:19.620 --> 49:21.130
She deserves better.

49:21.180 --> 49:22.770
She don't want better.

49:22.820 --> 49:25.160
I can't see how to carry on.

49:26.060 --> 49:27.530
I've got this sickness...

49:27.580 --> 49:30.850
Listen! She can't live without you...

49:30.900 --> 49:33.570
and I can't live without her.

49:33.620 --> 49:35.620
Do you understand me?

49:37.420 --> 49:40.290
We're like a little
set of skittles...

49:41.300 --> 49:43.570
.. we got to stay upright.

49:53.260 --> 49:57.090
Lindane. Kills everything.
Rats, cockroaches.

49:57.140 --> 50:01.130
Nothing hazardous will be left in
there after we've finished fogging.

50:01.180 --> 50:04.410
Mind you, what can you get
for three and six these days?

50:04.460 --> 50:06.170
Dignity, Mr Lancing.

50:06.220 --> 50:08.450
Dr Turner mentioned you've a newborn.

50:08.500 --> 50:11.570
Yes, Keith.

50:11.620 --> 50:13.010
Happy little chap.

50:13.060 --> 50:15.850
Would you be happy bringing
Keith back to this...

50:15.900 --> 50:18.730
even without the dysentery
and the cockroaches?

50:18.780 --> 50:20.330
I'm not responsible for housing.

50:20.380 --> 50:22.090
It's hard enough getting
this finished

50:22.140 --> 50:23.930
so the women can come
back this evening.

50:23.980 --> 50:28.250
We're not naive, Mr Lancing,
we know we can't save them all.

50:28.300 --> 50:31.410
But you can support an application
to the Housing Department that,

50:31.460 --> 50:35.730
fogged or not, this place is not
suitable for a new mother and baby.

50:35.780 --> 50:38.170
You're asking me to use my position

50:38.220 --> 50:40.890
to influence another
department's decision?

50:40.940 --> 50:43.490
Best advice I ever received?

50:43.540 --> 50:45.810
"When in the path of
an unstoppable force,

50:45.860 --> 50:48.400
"it's always best to surrender."

50:50.980 --> 50:52.970
They share the same mobile kitchen.

50:53.020 --> 50:55.010
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.530
The source of the dysentery outbreak.

50:57.580 --> 50:59.770
Bulthorpe and Moffat Road.

50:59.820 --> 51:02.330
They don't prepare food any
more, they have it delivered

51:02.380 --> 51:04.050
each day by mobile kitchen.

51:04.100 --> 51:06.370
The same kitchen. G&A Domestic.

51:06.420 --> 51:08.130
Their senior cook is off work

51:08.180 --> 51:10.850
with what they're referring
to as "gastroenteritis".

51:10.900 --> 51:13.530
But until then, he's been
incubating the disease.

51:13.580 --> 51:15.770
"She" and yes, exactly.

51:15.820 --> 51:19.770
Well, the mobile kitchen can link
the school cases and Bulthorpe,

51:19.820 --> 51:22.450
but what about George Sitwell?

51:22.500 --> 51:25.810
He gave a talk to the schoolchildren
about being a lock keeper.

51:25.860 --> 51:27.970
He stayed to lunch.

51:28.020 --> 51:30.050
Elementary.

51:30.100 --> 51:31.840
My dear Watson.

51:34.180 --> 51:35.890
Sh...

51:35.940 --> 51:38.090
don't cry, little one.

51:38.140 --> 51:40.610
What you got to cry about, eh?

51:42.900 --> 51:44.940
This is your daddy.

51:54.140 --> 51:56.880
He's always going to look after you.

51:57.860 --> 52:00.260
He's always going to be here.

52:02.780 --> 52:05.260
That's right, isn't it?

52:06.500 --> 52:08.640
I don't know how to be.

52:09.540 --> 52:12.460
A father. My husband.

52:14.300 --> 52:16.020
You have to.

52:20.660 --> 52:22.000
Always.

52:23.460 --> 52:24.820
Always.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.330
Nurse Crane!

52:36.380 --> 52:38.060
Nurse Crane.

52:40.980 --> 52:43.170
Dolores McEvoy and her family...

52:43.220 --> 52:46.690
Mr Lancing had a change of
heart, they're being rehoused.

52:46.740 --> 52:50.330
Woohoo! That conscience weighed
too heavy on him, after all.

52:50.380 --> 52:52.050
I hoped it would.

52:52.100 --> 52:54.810
Barley sugars, I hear
they're your favourites.

52:54.860 --> 52:58.970
My birthday's some months off,
I'm not given to celebrating it.

52:59.020 --> 53:01.820
Well, celebrate today, Nurse Crane.

53:13.540 --> 53:16.740
Makes you proud to be
from Poplar, don't it?

53:24.660 --> 53:26.010
Dirty bleeders.

53:26.060 --> 53:27.570
Nerve.

53:27.620 --> 53:29.420
Showing his face.

53:31.380 --> 53:33.770
I just wanted to check the time...

53:33.820 --> 53:36.420
for when Marie needs to be ready.

53:39.980 --> 53:43.780
We thought, with your wife so
recently having given birth...

53:45.420 --> 53:48.620
Well, we assumed she
wouldn't be taking part.

53:50.260 --> 53:55.090
I'll be stopping at home, of
course, looking after the baby.

53:55.140 --> 53:57.050
But Marie deserves to be here.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.730
After what you've done?

53:58.780 --> 54:00.770
You're all sinners now.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.250
Marie's the outgoing Queen,
she should be here.

54:03.300 --> 54:05.450
And if anybody doesn't like it,

54:05.500 --> 54:08.930
they can go home and stew in
their own mean-spiritedness.

54:08.980 --> 54:12.090
Didn't Jesus teach
us to love everyone...

54:12.140 --> 54:13.940
even the sinners?

54:14.740 --> 54:16.140
Tom?

54:17.300 --> 54:19.440
Especially the sinners.

54:31.780 --> 54:36.050
'A world is not just made of
bricks and mortar, but of minds.

54:36.100 --> 54:40.370
'We can rebuild cities,
paint beautiful facades,

54:40.420 --> 54:42.810
'invent new ways of living.

54:42.860 --> 54:45.620
'We can protect all that we have.'

54:47.020 --> 54:50.780
Hello! Hello, I've missed you!

55:16.660 --> 55:18.330
Boys!

55:18.380 --> 55:19.740
Boys!

55:23.540 --> 55:25.290
Get it!

55:25.340 --> 55:27.090
It's there, it's there!

55:27.140 --> 55:28.890
What are you doing?

55:28.940 --> 55:30.530
What would your parents say?

55:30.580 --> 55:32.170
They hate rats, too!

55:32.220 --> 55:33.970
~ We want to kill it.
~ Yeah!

55:34.020 --> 55:37.010
Do forget about these blasted rats.

55:37.060 --> 55:40.010
We are all God's creatures.

55:40.060 --> 55:42.970
It's just some are easier
to love than others.

55:43.020 --> 55:45.700
It's the others that need us most.

55:56.100 --> 55:58.370
'But that place which we call home

55:58.420 --> 56:02.450
'must be the place in which we
are ourselves with no facade,

56:02.500 --> 56:05.300
'no foundations weak below us.'

56:17.140 --> 56:21.850
'Only then can we face outwards
with our heads held high,

56:21.900 --> 56:26.620
'playing the roles assigned to
us with open, honest hearts.'

57:05.300 --> 57:07.050
Ladies and gentlemen,

57:07.100 --> 57:10.370
may I present Poplar's
new Rose Queen for 1960,

57:10.420 --> 57:12.220
Miss Joan Musson.

57:22.820 --> 57:26.020
And our outgoing Rose
Queen, Mrs Marie Amos.

58:11.100 --> 58:14.090
Sergeant Noakes, how many
prostitutes are there in Poplar?

58:14.140 --> 58:15.890
Er... 600 or 700.

58:15.940 --> 58:18.050
You want to start tonight?

58:18.100 --> 58:19.770
Yes! And not too late.

58:19.820 --> 58:22.810
Sergeant Noakes thinks we ought
to try to miss their rush hour.

58:22.860 --> 58:26.130
When it comes out, Nurse, just
you make sure it's a boy.

58:26.180 --> 58:28.810
We've been wanting a baby
for such a long time.

58:28.860 --> 58:32.610
This, Angela, is them
doing their mushy stuff.

58:32.660 --> 58:36.290
Call Dr Turner and tell him that
your wife has a retained placenta.

58:36.340 --> 58:40.050
I carried my purpose
wherever it was needed.

58:40.100 --> 58:43.410
And now I am a relic, a curiosity...

58:43.460 --> 58:45.220
and a nuisance.
