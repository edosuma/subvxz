00:23.560 --> 00:26.159
You got what you wanted, Anna.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.599
You made him face you in court.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.880
Now it's all about you.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.759
Louise said he could get
more money for this

00:52.760 --> 00:56.280
than the compensation for Liam
being murdered. Is that right?

01:25.520 --> 01:29.279
In the old days, the victim would
actually prosecute the case

01:29.280 --> 01:32.920
and the jury was selected because
they knew the people involved.

01:34.520 --> 01:38.039
Some believed the only punishment
a murderer should face

01:38.040 --> 01:42.120
is the one he risks from the friends
and family of the victim.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.199
An eye for an eye does not form
part of our defence, Anna.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.199
You have to stay out of prison

01:52.200 --> 01:55.519
and that means winning the sympathy
of the judge and the jury

01:55.520 --> 02:00.200
and stating categorically that you
did not want Craig Myers dead.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.039
I said she could come in with me
tonight.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.280
She's still a bit frightened
and we can't find Oscar.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.040
Fine. Yeah?

03:43.520 --> 03:45.280
Everything OK?

03:49.520 --> 03:51.280
Ben in bed?

03:52.280 --> 03:53.760
Yeah.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.120
What?

04:00.080 --> 04:01.839
The school phoned.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.279
Why?

04:03.280 --> 04:05.279
They want us to make an appointment

04:05.280 --> 04:08.120
to go in and talk about
Ben's recent behaviour.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.040
All kids play up.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.759
He needs to know exactly
what's going on, Mum.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.759
He knows what's going on.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.240
So you've spoken to him, then,
have you?

04:29.040 --> 04:31.039
You keep on talking about the truth

04:31.040 --> 04:33.760
but all you ever do is try
and protect him from it.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.920
How are you?

05:00.720 --> 05:03.519
Still going, you know.
It's been a while?

05:03.520 --> 05:04.959
Hi, Gerry.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.039
Danny, Gerry Tythe.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.759
He was lead detective
on Liam's murder.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.600
This is my boyfriend, Danny.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.360
Good to meet you, son.

05:16.360 --> 05:20.119
Thank you for coming. Especially
now you can play golf every day!

05:20.120 --> 05:22.199
Wait till she knows you're here.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.640
Actually, Anna asked me to come.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.279
That way?

05:55.280 --> 05:56.760
Come on.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.360
So where've you been going?

06:02.040 --> 06:05.520
Sounds like you've been bunking off
most weeks. You must go somewhere.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.359
You're not in trouble, Ben,

06:09.360 --> 06:12.120
but it's not safe
nobody knowing where you are.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.040
Son, if there's something
bothering you.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.519
There's nothing you can't tell us.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.240
Why should I?
You don't tell me anything.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.040
What do you mean?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.840
Do you mean about Liam?

06:39.040 --> 06:42.280
We've talked to you about
what happened to your brother.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.039
I still don't really know.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.160
I've told you everything I know.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.040
Well, there's more than that
on the internet.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.759
There's only one person
who really knows what happened.

07:01.760 --> 07:06.280
That's why we're taking him
to court, so he has to face us.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.279
You could go to prison,
couldn't you?

07:11.280 --> 07:13.679
It's possible Ben, yeah.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.119
But we're going to do
everything we can

07:16.120 --> 07:18.280
to make sure that doesn't happen.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.959
Why did you say "not guilty", then?

07:24.960 --> 07:27.040
Who told you that?

07:30.280 --> 07:32.040
Was it Daniel?

07:36.520 --> 07:38.040
You're right.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.120
You deserve to know everything.

07:47.280 --> 07:51.000
Shall I tell you something
I've never told anybody before?

07:54.280 --> 07:56.519
When I finally got to see Liam,

07:56.520 --> 07:58.520
they wouldn't let me hold him.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.039
I was only allowed to touch
his fingers,

08:02.040 --> 08:03.960
just for a minute.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.399
I still dream about it.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.199
And I've never told anybody this

08:11.200 --> 08:16.440
but even though it's a bad dream,
I still don't want to wake up.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.520
Because I know I'm going to
have to let him go again.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.040
Anna.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.279
I swear that I shall tell the truth,
the whole truth,

08:32.280 --> 08:34.279
and nothing but the truth.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.279
I swear that I shall tell the truth,
the whole truth

08:37.280 --> 08:39.279
and nothing but the truth.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.039
Thank you, My Lady.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.519
Could you tell the court
your full name and age, please?

08:46.520 --> 08:48.279
Anna Louise Dean.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.959
I'm 42.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.559
Are you working at the moment, Anna?

08:52.560 --> 08:56.119
Yes. At the Springmount Surgery
in Edinburgh.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.039
And what is your occupation?

08:58.040 --> 09:00.079
I'm a registered nurse.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.519
How long have you cared for people
professionally?

09:03.520 --> 09:06.039
I did some nursing
straight from school

09:06.040 --> 09:08.519
but stopped when I got pregnant
with Liam.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.520
Then I went back to it in 2007.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.759
I wanted to make him proud.

09:14.760 --> 09:19.239
So 11 years working as a dedicated,
full-time nurse?

09:19.240 --> 09:21.039
Yes.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.519
Caring for some of the most
vulnerable people

09:23.520 --> 09:26.679
in the community.
Do you find that rewarding?

09:26.680 --> 09:28.040
Yes.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.679
Having been through what you have,

09:31.680 --> 09:35.040
what would you say is the
most important thing to you, Anna?

09:40.520 --> 09:42.040
Family.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.279
Doesn't come along
very often, particularly

10:36.280 --> 10:39.279
if you're aged between 14 and 19
with an interest in the arts.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.279
Yes, Cashback To The Future is
something new for the summer.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.920
A programme...

11:51.280 --> 11:53.519
Daddy, I'm ready for school!

11:53.520 --> 11:56.519
Craig... Get her inside now!
What's wrong, Daddy?

11:56.520 --> 12:01.400
Jess... Jess... Jessica, come on.
Come inside now. Good girl.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.199
I'm going to take her to school
in a minute. Get rid of that.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.199
I'm sorry I shouted,

12:15.200 --> 12:16.800
but...

12:27.520 --> 12:31.280
Do you think someone's been in the
house? We should call the police.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.040
I already... I think I should
take her away, Craig.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
I'm going to take her away.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.119
But we're a family. Just for a
while, until the trial is over,

12:49.120 --> 12:51.120
and then we can see where we are.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.040
You're leaving me?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.520
No, I'm...

13:01.520 --> 13:03.520
I'm putting Jess first.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.040
That's what we said we'd always do,
no matter what, isn't it?

13:21.040 --> 13:23.759
When you were told about the attack
on the man accused

13:23.760 --> 13:25.560
of being Eddie J Turner...

13:26.560 --> 13:28.680
how did you feel?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.080
Pleased.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.439
I said Liam could go to the shop
on his own.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.519
He'd done it before and I don't
know if he was lured away

13:48.520 --> 13:51.199
or if he took a short cut
but I let him go.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.679
Then, afterwards, we didn't get
justice for him.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.199
I failed him twice over.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.160
So when I heard his killer
had suffered...

14:01.280 --> 14:02.839
I was pleased.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.759
My Lady, nowhere has it been
established that Mr Myers

14:05.760 --> 14:07.439
has ever killed anyone.

14:07.440 --> 14:12.040
Stick to answering the question
as asked, please, Mrs Dean.

14:17.040 --> 14:22.040
When DI Grover told you that
Craig Myers wasn't dead...

14:23.040 --> 14:25.040
how did you feel then?

14:34.280 --> 14:35.760
You were...

14:36.760 --> 14:38.919
relieved, were you not?

14:38.920 --> 14:41.279
Don't lead the witness, please.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.279
I apologise. Allow me to rephrase.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.200
I know what you're asking.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.360
Did you want Craig Myers dead?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.280
Anna?

15:05.040 --> 15:06.279
No.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.799
I didn't.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.359
All I've ever wanted is to be told
who he is

15:11.360 --> 15:13.280
and where he is.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.040
Trust the public with the truth,
she says.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.280
Doctor will be here shortly.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.760
They're gone.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.520
Rebecca and Jess. They've left.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.839
You make sure your advocate knows
that she tells the court

16:55.840 --> 16:58.519
exactly what this has done
to you, all right?

16:58.520 --> 17:00.280
Why do you care?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.280
About me, I mean.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.520
Why does it matter so much to you?

17:11.040 --> 17:12.760
My wife left me.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.640
About six months ago.

17:16.640 --> 17:20.759
Not long before that, a sex worker
named Cathy was arrested

17:20.760 --> 17:24.040
with a... large quantity of drugs.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.440
I'd known her for years.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.519
She offered me various inducements
to help her out.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.040
I refused.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.200
She accused me of sexually harassing
her over a number of years.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.039
Did you?

17:45.040 --> 17:46.880
I did have feelings for her.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.839
I mean, I'd never have done
anything about it, but I did.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.600
Maybe I still do.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.040
My wife saw it even before I did.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.760
When I admitted it...

18:04.680 --> 18:06.360
she left.

18:08.960 --> 18:12.359
Whether Cathy misread me
trying to help her,

18:12.360 --> 18:14.639
it doesn't matter now, does it?

18:14.640 --> 18:16.599
It's never going to go away.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.760
Mud sticks, right?

18:24.040 --> 18:27.759
In the end, the most important thing
is that you can look yourself

18:27.760 --> 18:32.040
in the eye and say, "I know who I am
and what I've done."

18:55.040 --> 18:57.279
Still causing trouble, then?

18:57.280 --> 18:59.079
Looks like it.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.680
Thanks for coming.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.520
I'm always here for you.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.760
Are you?

19:50.040 --> 19:54.759
Is she coming in at all today or...?
I don't think so, William, no.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.679
Where is she?

19:56.680 --> 19:59.039
I've told you,
I can't tell you that.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.759
Why didn't she tell me
she wasn't coming in today?

20:01.760 --> 20:04.519
If you take a seat,
there's a nurse coming...

20:04.520 --> 20:06.440
She said she trusted me!

20:20.040 --> 20:22.039
You're not sure he's the right man?

20:22.040 --> 20:24.200
I am. Others aren't.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.280
I need proof, Gerry.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.439
You've already done so much for us.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.679
You did everything you could
to see him properly punished

20:33.680 --> 20:36.519
and I would never want to put you
in an awkward position.

20:36.520 --> 20:40.039
Apart from you, I'd be the last
person to be told his new identity.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.680
Officially, I know.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.359
But you all talk. I know you do.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.760
At your clubs and golf courses,
you gossip.

20:49.760 --> 20:53.520
If there's anything you can tell me,
anything at all.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.679
I know for a fact
that Turner's social worker

21:02.680 --> 21:05.520
was based in Inverclyde.
Where did you get that from?

21:06.520 --> 21:08.519
You saw what he did, Gerry.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.599
You said it was the
worst day of your career.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.120
It was.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.040
He thinks he's got away with it
all over again.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.200
I've got the name
of Turner's social worker.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.279
Judith Morbury.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.759
For definite?

21:30.760 --> 21:32.679
Ever since he got out.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.759
She's retired now but she still
sees a few clients.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.279
I don't know where she meets them.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.040
Can you find out?

21:42.040 --> 21:45.039
You've given your evidence.
What are you worried about?

21:45.040 --> 21:48.279
Apart from being sent to prison
and my kids going in to care?

21:48.280 --> 21:50.040
That won't happen.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.760
Can you find out where Judith
Morbury meets her clients or not?

22:02.760 --> 22:04.360
Please.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.600
She's not going to answer, William.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.280
Hello.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.119
Right.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.920
All rise.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.439
Why didn't you want to go
to court today?

23:21.440 --> 23:24.599
Ms Mackie told me she'd phone
and tell me what happened.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.040
I wish Ms Mackie would phone me
and...

23:28.280 --> 23:30.040
tell me anything really.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.279
She has completely changed
my world view

23:33.280 --> 23:35.480
when it comes to lassies
with glasses.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.680
What's the difference anyway?

23:46.440 --> 23:48.520
Even when Bex and Jess left...

23:49.520 --> 23:52.359
I still thought the trial
could change things

23:52.360 --> 23:54.760
but it won't, will it?

23:57.120 --> 23:59.520
It won't change the way
they look at me.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.120
Maybe it's time to think about
moving on.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.680
Starting again, I mean.
Maybe somewhere in England.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.519
Why, should I?

24:24.520 --> 24:27.280
Because like you say,
it's not going away, is it?

24:28.280 --> 24:30.360
It's no good kidding ourselves.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.520
And what about you?

24:43.680 --> 24:45.760
You know I love you, don't you?

24:51.040 --> 24:53.040
But I've built a life here.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.040
You as well.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.200
We'll still see each other.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.600
We'll still look out for each other
no matter what.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.520
I know who I am and what I've done.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.040
Hey, Steve. Hi.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.759
He's been banging on about Anna Dean
since I called you.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.680
Thanks for the heads up, Jim.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.519
He's in there. Be quick.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.360
All right. Cheers, mate.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.400
Why do I have to be
down here on my own?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.760
Where and when did you first
hear the name Craig Myers?

26:35.040 --> 26:36.479
No comment.

26:36.480 --> 26:40.199
You used social media to instruct
someone to attack him, didn't you?

26:40.200 --> 26:43.039
No comment.
Did you have any evidence?

26:43.040 --> 26:44.319
No?

26:44.320 --> 26:47.759
It was a wild accusation made
against an innocent man, right?

26:47.760 --> 26:50.359
What will we find when we start
examining your phone?

26:50.360 --> 26:53.759
I'm not the criminal. Do you know
who attacked Craig Myers?

26:53.760 --> 26:56.519
No, but I'm glad they did!

26:56.520 --> 26:57.799
Anna!

26:57.800 --> 26:59.520
Now we stop.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.159
Do you recognise that interview?

27:04.160 --> 27:05.519
Yes.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.279
Then you acknowledge saying
that you were glad

27:08.280 --> 27:10.600
someone had attacked Craig Myers?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.719
I said it again this morning.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.759
But the recording is proof
of how you felt at the time

27:16.760 --> 27:18.520
of the crime, isn't it?

27:19.520 --> 27:21.159
I suppose so.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.520
And proof is everything after all.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.039
You have two children,
is that correct?

27:30.040 --> 27:32.199
I have three children.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.480
I'll always have three.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.519
And by campaigning for
Eddie J Turner's new identity

27:38.520 --> 27:40.199
to be made public,

27:40.200 --> 27:43.759
you believe that you are somehow
protecting your children?

27:43.760 --> 27:45.439
And everybody else's.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.359
And you believe that's rational?

27:47.360 --> 27:49.279
That whoever Eddie J Turner is,

27:49.280 --> 27:52.359
he may still return to harm
the rest of your family?

27:52.360 --> 27:54.839
Nobody knows why he did it
in the first place,

27:54.840 --> 27:57.119
so what's to stop him
doing it again?

27:57.120 --> 28:01.439
You see, some would say that that
is totally irrational, Mrs Dean.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.199
Paranoid even.

28:03.200 --> 28:08.040
That you suspect some sort of
vendetta against you personally.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.040
Why were you so angry, William?

28:13.040 --> 28:16.600
Even when they brought you here, you
were still shouting about Anna Dean.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.759
About being let down by her.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.560
Betrayed.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.720
What exactly did you mean?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.520
Do you know where Anna is now?

28:38.040 --> 28:39.920
She's in the High Court.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.920
That's why she wasn't at work.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.160
Do you believe in an eye for an eye,
Mrs Dean?

28:49.160 --> 28:52.519
I believe that it's my job
to make sure no-one forgets

28:52.520 --> 28:56.639
how much Liam suffered or how badly
this system let him down.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.519
Fine, but that wasn't
the question I asked.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.039
What you're asking
doesn't make sense

29:02.040 --> 29:04.039
because it's not like for like.

29:04.040 --> 29:07.039
His life and Liam's
don't have the same value.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.519
The day he killed a child,
he gave up his human rights.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.520
You can't compare them.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.120
She's in a lot of trouble.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.999
You'd like to help her,
wouldn't you?

29:26.000 --> 29:29.919
And you can, but it's important
that you tell me the truth

29:29.920 --> 29:33.520
about how you've helped her
in the past, do you understand?

29:36.040 --> 29:39.040
You and me both know
that you attacked Craig Myers...

29:40.040 --> 29:42.960
on Halloween last year, don't we?

29:44.520 --> 29:49.039
What you need to do now is admit
that she told you to do it.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.560
Otherwise, she'll carry on...

29:52.560 --> 29:54.759
hurting and using innocent people.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.320
People like you, William.
You're a victim. That's not true.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.039
Anna Dean doesn't care about
anyone or anything

30:02.040 --> 30:04.480
except getting vengeance
for her son.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.679
The truth is that you're obsessed by
the desire for revenge, aren't you?

30:10.680 --> 30:13.039
Revenge at any cost. No.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.359
You posted that message
knowing full well

30:15.360 --> 30:18.279
that someone would attack
Craig Myers, didn't you? No.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.759
And you know full well
who did so, don't you?

30:20.760 --> 30:22.519
This is the wrong way round.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.999
I'm not the criminal
and he's not the victim.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.919
Mrs Dean... It's the public
that need protected from him,

30:27.920 --> 30:31.039
not the other way around.
You keep referring to "him".

30:31.040 --> 30:34.519
To be clear, by "him",
you mean Craig Myers?

30:34.520 --> 30:37.720
I mean Eddie J Turner.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.679
You think she cares about you,
you think you're friends,

30:42.680 --> 30:45.280
but why didn't she tell you
she was going to court?

30:46.280 --> 30:48.279
She might not be back at work.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.520
You might never see her again.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.519
This...

30:54.520 --> 30:58.039
obsession of hers,
it's ruining lives,

30:58.040 --> 31:01.200
and Anna needs us to stop her
for her own sake.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.519
If you really care about her,

31:04.520 --> 31:06.280
then help me.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.640
But you need to do it quickly,
William.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.159
I've been stared at for 15 years.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.799
Everyone knows who I am.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.279
I've been abused online
and on the street

31:28.280 --> 31:30.519
for letting my son go to the shop
on his own.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.439
I didn't ask for any of this.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.479
This is not a press conference,
Mrs Dean.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.279
Now I'm being offered
psychological support.

31:38.280 --> 31:42.039
I got no help as a victim of crime
but as soon I'm an offender...

31:42.040 --> 31:47.239
Mrs Dean, whilst I understand
you have grievances,

31:47.240 --> 31:50.759
you must understand that
this court does not exist

31:50.760 --> 31:53.199
to provide closure for victims.

31:53.200 --> 31:57.039
It exists to uphold
a set of normative laws

31:57.040 --> 32:00.360
that, as individuals,
we must all live by.

32:01.360 --> 32:04.920
For anything else,
I'm afraid you must look elsewhere.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.640
Where?

32:09.640 --> 32:12.519
Where can we talk about
right and wrong

32:12.520 --> 32:14.680
instead of what can be proved?

32:15.680 --> 32:19.039
Nobody here is interested
in individuals,

32:19.040 --> 32:22.119
you only care what harm
has been done to the state.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.759
Mrs Dean...
And you only matter to each other.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.039
This has got nothing to do
with justice

32:27.040 --> 32:30.039
and what happened to Liam
has got nothing to do with you.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.039
It was my crime -
mine and my family's.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.879
You've tried to take it away from us
but I won't let you.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.720
This is your final warning!

32:41.720 --> 32:43.719
You can't bury your head.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.359
You need to listen to me, William.
Listen to me!

32:46.360 --> 32:48.040
Listen! Listen!

32:49.040 --> 32:51.880
You can help her.
You can help Anna Dean.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.360
Mrs Dean...

33:02.280 --> 33:06.120
do you believe that Craig Myers
is Eddie J Turner?

33:07.120 --> 33:09.040
I know he is.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.279
No further questions, My Lady.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.560
Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury...

33:18.560 --> 33:22.359
before I ask you to retire
to consider your verdict,

33:22.360 --> 33:27.039
I must ask you to put out of your
mind any feelings of sympathy

33:27.040 --> 33:32.759
or revulsion you may feel
for anyone involved in this case.

33:32.760 --> 33:37.759
We are not here to establish
Mr Myers' identity.

33:37.760 --> 33:43.040
We are here to establish
Mrs Dean's guilt or otherwise.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.600
All rise.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.279
Well done.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.918
Where's Danny?

34:17.920 --> 34:20.040
He said he wasn't feeling well.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.360
Hello?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.040
Yes.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.199
Anna?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.279
You bastard!

35:23.280 --> 35:26.040
You sick, evil bastard!

35:50.760 --> 35:52.760
I'll be in in a minute.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.759
Where are you? Waiting for
the social worker to turn up

35:59.760 --> 36:02.280
at Duthrie Cafe,
where she meets her clients.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.119
The manager knows her because
she always stays a long time,

36:06.120 --> 36:08.679
meets more than one person
and wants to pay by card.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.039
Expenses, I'm guessing.

36:10.040 --> 36:13.039
Did you show the manager
the photo of Myers?

36:13.040 --> 36:15.040
I have done this before, you know?

36:16.040 --> 36:17.759
I showed her a version of it.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.599
It could be one of her clients
but she wouldn't swear to it,

36:20.600 --> 36:23.239
but there's definitely a guy
with dark hair around 30.

36:23.240 --> 36:27.119
Surely he'll want to see her, what
with everything that's going on?

36:27.120 --> 36:29.680
Well, we'll see, won't we?

36:31.280 --> 36:33.040
Thanks, Mo.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.520
No Danny?
No, I haven't heard from him.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.280
Everything OK with you two?

37:03.280 --> 37:06.280
Yeah, he's just been a bit tense,
that's all.

37:32.040 --> 37:35.039
What have you done? Hey, hey, hey!
What have you done?!

37:35.040 --> 37:38.039
Stop it, Anna! Anna...!
What did you do?!

37:38.040 --> 37:39.520
Anna!

38:04.040 --> 38:06.040
How could he?

38:10.520 --> 38:14.440
Well, he lost his brother before he
even met him and now he's lost you.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.200
He's not lost me.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.760
Even if I'm found guilty...
I'm not talking about prison.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.040
Turner didn't do this, Anna.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.760
You're doing this.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.199
You've made yourself a victim

38:36.200 --> 38:39.040
and now you've given him
the power over all of us.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.439
How long have you thought that?
The boy was given a sentence.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.920
He didn't set it but he served it.
What more can he do? The boy?

38:54.760 --> 38:57.519
Why have you never said
any of this before?

38:57.520 --> 39:00.119
Maybe the same reason
you haven't told me

39:00.120 --> 39:02.280
that you're back on those pills.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.360
Look...

39:17.360 --> 39:21.280
the thing is, Anna,
you've got the power, not him.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.039
He can't change anything
but you can,

39:26.040 --> 39:27.760
for both of you.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.640
You're not talking
about forgiveness?

39:38.520 --> 39:41.759
Liam is the only one with the
right to forgive him.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.519
No, I don't mean
for what he did to Liam.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.520
I mean for what he's done to you.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.280
This isn't about me. But it is.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.519
No, Lenny.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.040
No!

40:04.520 --> 40:06.759
What if it was Ben in his shoes?

40:06.760 --> 40:11.040
Ben would never... You'd want
him forgiven, wouldn't you?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.280
He's not the same.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.359
Some things are unforgivable.

40:19.360 --> 40:23.240
But that's the only time
forgiveness means anything.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.280
What's the point in forgiving
the forgivable?

40:29.520 --> 40:32.039
You've really been thinking
about this.

40:32.040 --> 40:35.280
This is how you get revenge, Anna.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.279
He doesn't deserve it.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.599
It's got nothing to do with him!

40:41.600 --> 40:43.279
It's about you!

40:43.280 --> 40:44.680
Us!

40:45.680 --> 40:48.680
We can't get Liam back
but we can get you back.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.679
Hate's not working, is it?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.279
Look at you.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.040
It's killing you.
It's killing everything!

41:07.760 --> 41:11.679
Letting go of what I feel
about that man

41:11.680 --> 41:14.280
would be like letting go
of Liam again...

41:15.280 --> 41:17.200
and I can't do that.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.360
Please, Anna.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.759
It's not too late.

41:36.760 --> 41:40.320
Whatever the verdict, I need you
to say you'll let this thing go.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.280
Come on, Anna, please.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.560
I can't.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.040
I'm sorry.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.760
I thought you understood.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.040
Gerry.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.400
Mum's not here but come in.

43:36.040 --> 43:39.160
Lenny! Gerry, come on in.
I can't stay.

43:40.520 --> 43:42.279
Is your boyfriend here?

43:42.280 --> 43:45.039
No, I've not seen him
since lunchtime.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.039
How long have you known him, Lou?

43:47.040 --> 43:50.000
About a year. Why?
Is something wrong?

43:51.000 --> 43:54.519
You need to stay away from Danny
Callaghan. Why? What's he done?

43:54.520 --> 43:57.519
I thought I knew him at court
so I checked.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.320
He's got a record.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.039
For possession.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.039
He told me. What?

44:04.040 --> 44:06.520
Has he told you he's spent
time inside?

44:07.520 --> 44:11.039
I didn't think so. I'm sorry to do
this, Lou, but you don't know him.

44:11.040 --> 44:14.119
No offence but I'm a big girl now.
Hold on.

44:14.120 --> 44:17.519
So, wait, he went to prison
for possession?

44:17.520 --> 44:20.320
No, for more than that.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.760
I don't know the details, but...

44:24.760 --> 44:26.760
I do know he's bad news.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.040
Why would you know him?

44:35.520 --> 44:41.040
Danny Callaghan was the kid who
found Liam's body under the bridge.

44:43.040 --> 44:46.040
When you said Danny,
I knew it was him.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.359
He didn't report it for hours

44:50.360 --> 44:54.039
and then we could barely get any
sense out of him. What do you mean?

44:54.040 --> 44:56.360
He's deliberately got close to you.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.040
I've got nothing to offer you.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.440
There's...

45:21.440 --> 45:23.280
tea and coffee downstairs.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.520
Where's the whisky?

45:51.760 --> 45:53.320
This OK?

48:02.040 --> 48:04.280
Things are going to come out and...

48:05.760 --> 48:08.200
people are going to be
saying things...

48:09.200 --> 48:10.760
about me.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.040
I can't stay.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.040
But I needed to see you
before I go away.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.040
Long day?

48:45.760 --> 48:48.039
Do you remember, after it happened,

48:48.040 --> 48:51.039
how weird it felt to
look out the window

48:51.040 --> 48:53.360
and see people going to work or...

48:54.360 --> 48:56.280
living their lives?

48:57.520 --> 48:59.280
Nobody tells you...

49:00.760 --> 49:03.040
how far down you can go.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.840
Or how dark it gets.

49:07.840 --> 49:11.760
Or how scary it is when you realise
you might not resurface.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.760
So you start a campaign.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.200
Or you drink.

49:29.760 --> 49:33.479
Tell people you can't kill yourself
because you've still got a daughter

49:33.480 --> 49:35.279
but, actually,

49:35.280 --> 49:37.360
you're doing it anyway, just...

49:38.360 --> 49:40.040
slowly.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.280
I've missed you.

49:50.280 --> 49:52.360
No, you haven't.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.760
No.

49:58.760 --> 50:00.360
Not much.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.880
Maybe a bit.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.280
I've been watching the video.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.840
The interview.

52:16.760 --> 52:18.680
I'll be watching Liam...

52:20.040 --> 52:23.040
but it's like Turner's sitting
right next to me.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.119
He's always there.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.000
I can't get rid of him.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.360
I went to the court yesterday.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.560
I wanted to see what he looked like.

52:35.560 --> 52:38.279
I found myself following him.
I don't know why.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.919
I don't know what I thought
I was going to do.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.760
Then suddenly I realised...

52:44.280 --> 52:46.279
what if it's not him?

52:46.280 --> 52:47.920
What if..

52:48.920 --> 52:50.760
This guy's innocent?

52:51.760 --> 52:53.279
He's not.

52:53.280 --> 52:56.040
But Lou said there's
no actual proof.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.760
I perjured myself today.

53:06.520 --> 53:10.039
I was asked if I wanted Turner dead
and I said no.

53:10.040 --> 53:13.520
But as I was saying it,
I realised that I do.

53:15.520 --> 53:17.520
I think I always have.

53:25.520 --> 53:30.279
I know for a fact that he meets
his social worker in a cafe

53:30.280 --> 53:32.280
and I know which one.

53:34.760 --> 53:38.759
If someone was to give the manager
of that cafe some money

53:38.760 --> 53:42.040
and asked them to call the next time
he meets her there...

53:45.760 --> 53:48.279
that would be proof enough,

53:48.280 --> 53:50.040
wouldn't it?

53:53.200 --> 53:55.040
Enough for what?

54:33.520 --> 54:35.520
It has to end.

55:04.760 --> 55:08.279
Craig Myers is not Eddie J Turner.

55:08.280 --> 55:10.359
You're lying.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.199
I saw him, Anna.

55:12.200 --> 55:15.320
We have ruined
an innocent man's life!

55:36.280 --> 55:37.999
I was wrong.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.800
About what?

55:41.240 --> 55:42.760
Craig Myers.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.280
All of it.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.520
You were never convinced
but I wouldn't listen.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.400
And now it's too late.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.919
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict

56:16.920 --> 56:20.519
in respect of the accused,
Anna Louise Dean?

56:20.520 --> 56:21.759
Yes.

56:21.760 --> 56:23.680
What is your verdict?

56:24.305 --> 56:30.564
