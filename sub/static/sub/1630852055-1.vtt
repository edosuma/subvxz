00:08.925 --> 00:13.605
I had a friend tell me about
a friend of his,

00:13.644 --> 00:16.524
someone he knew really well.

00:18.524 --> 00:20.644
No word of a lie, this.

00:23.285 --> 00:28.605
He saw The Wolf Hunter last week.
In the flesh.

00:30.644 --> 00:35.564
Well... flesh and fur.

00:35.604 --> 00:39.765
Half man, half wolf.

00:39.804 --> 00:41.564
All trouble.

00:43.884 --> 00:48.164
You see, he lures us humanfolk

00:48.204 --> 00:51.244
into them woods out there,

00:51.284 --> 00:55.765
and he slashes at your face
with his metal talons.

00:55.804 --> 01:01.085
Then he finishes you off
with a silver bullet to the skull.

01:06.004 --> 01:11.564
What a load of utter cobblers.

01:15.844 --> 01:18.965
Thank you for that, Mr Everett.

01:19.004 --> 01:21.364
If I could just say sorry again
about the hot tubs.

01:21.405 --> 01:24.364
I know the two of you were really
hoping to use them this afternoon,

01:24.405 --> 01:26.885
but I am hoping to get them
up and running.

01:26.924 --> 01:30.165
Maybe I could offer you
a glass of prosecco...

01:53.045 --> 01:56.364
Still no luck?
I just don't get it, Row.

01:56.405 --> 02:00.685
It's not an airlock, filter's fine,
temperature sensor is working.

02:00.724 --> 02:03.325
I just can't figure the problem.

02:03.364 --> 02:06.084
I'll tell you
what's wrong with that!

02:06.125 --> 02:09.764
It's a bleeding hot tub,
that's what's wrong with it.

02:09.805 --> 02:14.485
As advertised, Mr Everett,
this is a glampsite now.

02:14.525 --> 02:18.324
Been coming here decades.
Never seen the like.

02:18.365 --> 02:20.004
What's that smell?

02:21.525 --> 02:24.604
Sage. It gets rid of bad energy.

02:24.645 --> 02:29.805
Ronnie, she's doing witchcraft now.
Is she, love?

02:29.844 --> 02:35.604
Marvellous.
Your cod in butter sauce is ready.

02:35.645 --> 02:37.764
Praise the Lord.

02:37.805 --> 02:41.284
At least there are some things
you can still rely on.

02:43.044 --> 02:46.604
Thankfully,
they're OK about the hot tubs.

02:46.645 --> 02:48.925
They're coming around to the idea
of being off the grid.

02:48.965 --> 02:52.764
Good, that's something, then.
Mm. Turns out he's a banker.

02:54.284 --> 02:57.604
Told them we were looking for
investors, so you never know.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.884
Still here, Jez?
Looks like it.

03:01.164 --> 03:06.164
Actually, I best be off.
I'm meeting someone.

03:06.205 --> 03:10.805
Am I OK to leave my tools here?
Of course. See you tomorrow. Yeah?

03:10.844 --> 03:12.085
Try stopping me.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.805
Brandon.
Jez.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.004
Hello?

04:40.324 --> 04:42.605
Is that you mucking about?

06:23.805 --> 06:25.245
Morning, everyone.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.524
Hi, Mel.
Morning, Mel.

06:27.564 --> 06:30.564
Please tell me you're late
cos you finally got a life.

06:30.605 --> 06:34.045
I think the chances of me getting
a life around here are pretty slim.

06:34.084 --> 06:39.004
That's why, first sign
of an acting job, and boom, I'm off.

06:39.045 --> 06:42.925
Idiot! How old are you?

06:42.964 --> 06:46.125
Old enough, sweet cheeks. I'm
heading to the woods, you coming?

06:46.165 --> 06:48.165
Let me think about that. No.

06:48.204 --> 06:49.845
You loser!

06:49.884 --> 06:52.524
Oi, wait.
Leave it, Kel.

06:52.564 --> 06:54.245
OK, one sec, everyone.

06:55.925 --> 06:58.845
Right.

07:06.324 --> 07:09.125
So I've sent off my self tape
for that audition,

07:09.165 --> 07:11.485
and I've narrowed down
my list of agents.

07:11.524 --> 07:16.084
So fingers crossed, I'll be
out from under your feet in no time.

07:16.125 --> 07:19.404
Oh, I can't wait.
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

07:19.444 --> 07:22.125
Yeah, like a hole in the head.
Yeah, yeah.

07:48.285 --> 07:51.404
Oh, Paddy, get out. Go on.

07:53.404 --> 07:56.964
You know I'm not the biggest fan
of trick or treating,

07:57.004 --> 07:59.165
but can't I just
help with eating the sweets?

07:59.204 --> 08:02.204
No, you can't.
It's to raise money for the school.

08:02.245 --> 08:04.524
It's not till next week,
and I said we'd go.

08:04.564 --> 08:07.605
As what, though?
I thought I might go as a witch.

08:07.644 --> 08:10.365
Don't.

08:10.404 --> 08:12.404
Real question is,
who are you gonna go as?

08:12.444 --> 08:15.605
Well, as someone befitting
a man of my status,

08:15.644 --> 08:19.884
so, um, distinguished,
stately, imposing.

08:19.925 --> 08:23.564
Little Red Riding Hood!
Ooh, you found it!

08:28.004 --> 08:29.524
Yes, Winter.

08:33.404 --> 08:36.524
The victim's Jez Gladberry,
in his 20s.

08:36.565 --> 08:38.565
A local handyman and blacksmith.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.004
Next-of-kin's his father,
he's been informed.

08:41.044 --> 08:43.965
Who confirmed the body?
Local lad, Wade Andow.

08:44.004 --> 08:48.205
Said he was riding his dirt bike
in the woods when he found him.

08:48.245 --> 08:53.485
Whoa! Stop right there, my lovelies.

08:56.365 --> 08:59.164
Boot prints, not the victim's.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.884
Heavy boots, by the look of it.

09:01.924 --> 09:03.445
And...

09:05.965 --> 09:08.125
..canine prints.

09:08.164 --> 09:13.325
Canine prints?
If pressed, I'd say wolf.

09:13.365 --> 09:15.205
Not a real one, obviously.

09:15.245 --> 09:18.205
Unless, of course,
it's a wolf with one leg.

09:18.245 --> 09:21.044
The impression from
the base of the cane, right?

09:21.085 --> 09:25.284
Exactly. Claw marks across the
chest, puncture wounds to the neck,

09:25.325 --> 09:28.965
and a bullet to the head.
Silver?

09:29.004 --> 09:31.605
Smart money says so.

09:31.644 --> 09:35.205
Time of death,
last night between eight and ten.

09:35.245 --> 09:37.404
I'm sorry,
what are you both talking about?

09:37.445 --> 09:41.804
Are you saying this man
was killed by a wolf with a gun?

09:41.845 --> 09:46.284
The Wolf Hunter, actually.
It's all part of a meme.

09:46.325 --> 09:47.485
A meme?

09:47.524 --> 09:50.725
Sort of an idea spread through
social media and the internet.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.485
In this case, The Wolf Hunter.

09:53.524 --> 09:57.924
Little Worthy ran a competition,
the idea was to create

09:57.965 --> 10:01.125
a Midsomer urban myth
and The Wolf Hunter won it.

10:01.164 --> 10:02.485
It's really taken off.

10:02.524 --> 10:04.524
What exactly
does this Wolf Hunter do?

10:04.565 --> 10:06.085
He wears a wolf mask,

10:06.125 --> 10:09.884
he carries a cane
with a wolf's paw at its base,

10:09.924 --> 10:11.524
and a gun with a silver bullet.

10:11.565 --> 10:16.485
His hands have metal claws,
and he lures people to their death.

10:16.524 --> 10:19.164
It's a lot like
what we're seeing here, sir.

10:19.205 --> 10:20.485
Who ran this competition?

10:20.524 --> 10:23.004
The Hub. It's in internet cafe
in the village hall.

10:23.044 --> 10:26.884
How did you hear about it?
A friend entered.

10:29.965 --> 10:32.485
Sadly, I didn't make the shortlist.

10:34.245 --> 10:38.284
I'm surprised to hear that.
Did the victim have a phone on him?

10:38.325 --> 10:42.125
No, I'll contact service providers,
do a trace.

10:42.164 --> 10:46.365
Now, I notice there's a campsite
just the other side of these words.

10:46.404 --> 10:47.965
Actually, it's a glampsite, sir.

10:48.004 --> 10:49.845
I'm aware of what they call it,
Winter.

10:49.884 --> 10:53.485
I'm quite happy with the vocabulary
created before the year 2000.

10:53.524 --> 10:56.965
Why don't you get over there
and see if anyone saw him?

10:57.004 --> 10:59.365
I want to pay a visit to this "Nub".

10:59.404 --> 11:03.445
It's, er, Hub.
Indeed.

11:03.485 --> 11:07.325
I'll see if I can pick up
an urban dictionary on the way.

11:30.245 --> 11:32.605
Good, all right, boy?

11:40.325 --> 11:44.684
I heard about Jez, Eric.
I'm so sorry.

11:44.725 --> 11:46.524
So am I, Annie.

11:46.565 --> 11:48.965
You sure now's the time?

11:49.004 --> 11:52.965
Yes. More than ever.

12:21.445 --> 12:25.644
Oh, it's top-notch entertainment,
is this.

12:25.684 --> 12:28.804
Come and have a look, Robbie.

12:28.845 --> 12:32.845
Better than your la-dee-da
treatments.

12:32.884 --> 12:35.965
Actually, love,
I rather like the look of this one.

12:36.004 --> 12:39.445
Steam sauna
followed by a hot stone massage.

12:39.485 --> 12:44.644
40 quid?
You can buy a lawn mower for that.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.845
Are you familiar with
a Jez Gladberry?

13:00.884 --> 13:05.284
Of course. Terrible news, isn't it?

13:05.325 --> 13:08.085
You already know about his death?

13:08.125 --> 13:12.004
Everyone does.
His workshop's just down there.

13:13.365 --> 13:15.004
Everyone's really upset.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.725
He was just such a...
all-round lovely bloke.

13:18.764 --> 13:22.365
I'm sorry,
but how exactly does everyone know?

13:22.404 --> 13:25.725
It was posted on The Wolf Hunter
forum first thing this morning.

13:25.764 --> 13:30.205
Presumably by the person who
discovered the body, Wade Andow?

13:30.245 --> 13:34.445
Do you know where I might find him?
Yeah, he's just inside.

13:42.004 --> 13:45.764
No, listen to him, man.
Listen to him.

13:45.804 --> 13:47.644
Got all the chat, innit, Wade?

13:47.684 --> 13:51.445
The Wolf Hunter strikes.
I was cool about it.

13:51.485 --> 13:57.004
I mean, it's just a body, right?
The question is, who is next?

13:57.044 --> 14:01.565
Actually, the question is, did you
post news about the death online?

14:01.605 --> 14:05.004
No. I left the woods
and called you guys.

14:05.044 --> 14:08.605
I've only just got here.
Anyway, so, this is Josie.

14:08.644 --> 14:13.845
She's our expert.
She updates The Wolf Hunter website.

14:13.884 --> 14:17.125
You know,
trying to make sense of everything.

14:17.164 --> 14:20.445
The Wolf Hunter has certainly
captured everyone's imagination.

14:20.485 --> 14:24.684
Tell me about it.
Even kids like to dress up as him.

14:24.725 --> 14:25.884
Well, not now.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.004
Um, Kel, you want to take a break?

14:30.044 --> 14:34.485
No, I'd rather just be busy. Thanks.

14:34.524 --> 14:37.884
Your cafe is very popular.

14:37.924 --> 14:40.565
That's because we give them
what they want. Connectivity.

14:40.605 --> 14:42.924
Which is something of a luxury
around here.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.164
Poor internet,
it's a rubbish Wi-Fi connection.

14:46.205 --> 14:48.845
I wanted to create a nest,

14:48.884 --> 14:52.605
a sort of haven where
I could bring everyone together.

14:52.644 --> 14:57.404
I see from your sign
there's an exhibition.

14:57.445 --> 15:00.365
Yes, it's just through here,
do you want to follow me?

15:08.924 --> 15:13.125
Jez left just after eight,
said he was going to meet someone.

15:13.164 --> 15:16.125
Did he say who?
No.

15:16.164 --> 15:17.845
I thought it was odd, though.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.365
He got a text
and headed towards the woods,

15:20.404 --> 15:24.284
but the village is over that way.
So he had his phone with him?

15:24.325 --> 15:26.205
He didn't when we found him.

15:26.245 --> 15:28.404
Well, maybe he dropped it
on the way.

15:28.445 --> 15:31.725
After he left, what did you do?
Had a little Barney, didn't we?

15:31.764 --> 15:35.205
Trouble in paradise, eh?

15:35.245 --> 15:38.565
Pat Everett. Pleasure's all yours.

15:47.565 --> 15:50.524
And I said to Ronnie,
"Ronnie," I said,

15:50.565 --> 15:55.085
"We've been coming here
30 years plus, no trouble."

15:55.125 --> 15:56.325
36.

15:56.365 --> 16:01.365
This year, with all their
newfangled gadgets, total mess.

16:01.404 --> 16:04.644
It drives Rowan's mum, Annie, mad.

16:04.684 --> 16:06.445
She runs the pub.

16:06.485 --> 16:10.725
It'll all end in tears.
Mark my words, my lad.

16:10.764 --> 16:12.485
Let the officer speak, Pat.

16:12.524 --> 16:15.365
Battenberg?
Oh, no, thank you.

16:17.804 --> 16:19.085
Right.

16:21.605 --> 16:25.125
Um, what were Mr and Mrs Yarrow
arguing about?

16:25.164 --> 16:27.565
Jez, I reckon.

16:27.605 --> 16:30.804
He'd come to fix the hot tub -
again.

16:30.845 --> 16:34.524
Ooh, good cup of tea, love.
Could trot a mouse across that.

16:34.565 --> 16:37.044
Did you see where they went after?

16:37.085 --> 16:43.725
Aye. They both stomped off, didn't
see hide nor hair of either of them

16:43.764 --> 16:45.924
until late this morning.
Could either of them

16:45.965 --> 16:48.524
have gone to the wood?
Well, I went for a walk

16:48.565 --> 16:51.125
and I saw Rowan headed that way.

16:54.924 --> 17:00.205
Oh, um, could you just excuse me?
Thank you.

17:06.964 --> 17:12.444
When The Wolf Hunter went viral,
we felt obliged to stage this.

17:12.483 --> 17:14.805
People come from miles.

17:14.845 --> 17:17.884
Is the gun real?
No, it's a dummy.

17:17.924 --> 17:21.243
Is this place locked at night?
Absolutely.

17:22.765 --> 17:23.924
This cane.

17:23.964 --> 17:27.884
In fact, all these items,
I'll need Forensics to check them.

17:27.924 --> 17:29.605
Are there others?
Yeah, for sure.

17:29.644 --> 17:31.085
Jez made them to order.

17:31.125 --> 17:34.684
He got himself quite a sideline
making all sorts of artefacts.

17:34.724 --> 17:36.684
Quite a character.

17:38.444 --> 17:43.404
He sure is.
A loner caught between worlds.

17:45.244 --> 17:48.845
A sort of Jekyll and Hyde werewolf
with a steampunk twist.

17:48.884 --> 17:51.005
Steampunk? Right.

17:52.444 --> 17:53.924
Interesting images.

17:53.964 --> 17:56.805
Tell that to the flower arranging
class that used to happen here.

17:56.845 --> 17:59.484
They weren't happy
that we had to move them.

17:59.525 --> 18:02.605
Steve Skelton.
Local photographer.

18:02.644 --> 18:06.484
Ah, did you take these?
Why the wood?

18:06.525 --> 18:08.484
It's the location
everyone's drawn to.

18:08.525 --> 18:13.325
And in medieval times,
home to the Worthy wolves.

18:13.365 --> 18:14.964
And it's where he hangs out.

18:15.005 --> 18:19.605
The kids go there all the time for
dead-of-the-night dares and dates.

18:19.644 --> 18:23.684
Whose idea was the competition?
Mine, I guess.

18:23.724 --> 18:25.845
And Steve won it.

18:25.884 --> 18:29.444
His entry was the only one
worth its salt, really.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.845
Why would you invent
something like this?

18:31.884 --> 18:34.005
Well, there was a local connection

18:34.045 --> 18:37.444
and I've always been a fan
of the werewolf stuff.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.805
Just thought I'd give it
a modern twist.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.045
An origin story.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.845
No idea it would take off though.
It's been nuts.

18:43.884 --> 18:45.404
Competition was just the beginning.

18:45.444 --> 18:48.845
Who else stands to profit
from the legend?

18:48.884 --> 18:54.125
Someone who runs a website or a...
a cafe? Clearly brings people in.

18:54.164 --> 18:57.525
It does,
but that so wasn't the idea.

18:57.565 --> 19:00.085
The Wolf Hunter belongs to us all.

19:02.484 --> 19:04.724
What's the idea with the red eyes?

19:04.765 --> 19:09.644
They appear above the door
of The Wolf Hunter's next victim.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.644
Do they appear
above Jez Gladberry's door?

19:13.684 --> 19:16.325
I have no idea.

19:23.924 --> 19:26.125
Strange, isn't it?

19:26.164 --> 19:29.125
Very.

19:29.164 --> 19:32.724
Fake lore becoming folklore.

20:19.204 --> 20:21.845
Shh!
There you are. For you.

20:21.884 --> 20:27.045
Thank you. Ooh, it's exciting.
After you.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.085
Wait!

21:10.964 --> 21:13.085
Help!

21:13.125 --> 21:15.404
Help!

21:15.444 --> 21:19.805
Help! Help!

22:04.525 --> 22:07.884
What do you mean "accident"?

22:07.925 --> 22:09.844
My Ronnie here
could have been killed.

22:09.884 --> 22:12.124
But I'm fine, love.
What happened?

22:12.165 --> 22:15.044
The door to the sauna locked shut.
Someone sabotaged the electrics.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.245
One of the guests
was trapped inside.

22:17.284 --> 22:20.084
You can't stay in that van any
longer, we'll put you in a lodge.

22:20.124 --> 22:22.364
Over my dead body.
That can be arranged.

22:22.405 --> 22:24.124
What did you say?

22:24.165 --> 22:26.725
I'm DCI Barnaby, let's just
all calm down, shall we?

22:26.765 --> 22:31.284
Calm down?
These two are flipping potty.

22:31.324 --> 22:33.844
Ronnie here nearly got cooked alive.

22:33.884 --> 22:36.925
First they target Jez, and now us.
Who's doing this?

22:36.965 --> 22:40.604
Him probably. He's sabotaging us.
Me?

22:40.644 --> 22:41.884
Easy, Mr Everett.

22:41.925 --> 22:45.205
There's no need for that.

22:45.245 --> 22:46.765
One thing at a time.

22:46.804 --> 22:49.965
Yes, starting with,
what were you doing

22:50.005 --> 22:52.525
trying to get rid of this phone?

22:52.564 --> 22:54.884
I told you, I panicked.

22:54.925 --> 22:57.364
That phone might contain
important information

22:57.405 --> 22:59.364
about who killed Mr Gladberry.

22:59.405 --> 23:01.564
We can charge you
with withholding evidence.

23:01.604 --> 23:03.844
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

23:03.884 --> 23:06.485
Why did you have anyway?
Jez left it.

23:06.525 --> 23:08.644
I knew he was coming back.

23:08.685 --> 23:11.604
Well, I thought he was.
And you didn't think to mention this

23:11.644 --> 23:13.405
when we spoke about the phone
earlier?

23:13.445 --> 23:15.245
I thought it would seem suspicious.

23:15.284 --> 23:17.485
Not as suspicious as trying to
throw it into a lake.

23:17.525 --> 23:19.124
And then accusing
one of your customers

23:19.165 --> 23:22.685
of trying to sabotage your business.
Look, I'm sorry about the phone.

23:22.725 --> 23:25.925
But that control unit
didn't smash itself.

23:25.965 --> 23:29.644
First Jez, and now this?
Someone is out to get us.

23:29.685 --> 23:30.884
Agreed.

23:30.925 --> 23:34.604
I thought it was just bad karma,
but it's much more than that.

23:34.644 --> 23:36.604
And it's damaging.

23:36.644 --> 23:41.884
We need to be a 60 percent capacity
just to keep our heads above water.

23:41.925 --> 23:44.725
We borrowed. Heavily.

23:44.765 --> 23:48.485
There is an angel investor in the
wings, but we are not about to hit

23:48.525 --> 23:51.364
any targets any investor
would insist on.

23:51.405 --> 23:56.005
Apart from Mr Everett, has
anyone else opposed the campsite?

23:56.044 --> 23:59.245
Eric Gladberry, but that was just
because he wanted to buy the land

23:59.284 --> 24:02.965
and we beat him to it.
He's Jez Gladberry's father?

24:03.005 --> 24:05.245
Mm. He has the windmill
on the edge of the village.

24:05.284 --> 24:08.324
Pat Everett said you had
words about Jez after he left.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.525
Pat Everett
needs to mind his own business.

24:10.564 --> 24:13.925
We're just stressed.
Is that why you had Jez's phone?

24:13.965 --> 24:15.364
What? No.

24:15.405 --> 24:18.765
Because you were suspicious
of Jez and your wife?

24:18.804 --> 24:21.965
I told you, he just left it.

24:22.005 --> 24:24.765
What happened after you rowed?
Where did you go?

24:24.804 --> 24:27.084
I went for a walk to clear my head.

24:27.124 --> 24:30.965
I like to channel the Chi energy
of nature to help ease my stress

24:31.005 --> 24:33.564
and dispel negativity.
And did it?

24:33.604 --> 24:37.084
As a matter of fact, it did.

24:37.124 --> 24:39.044
And you?

24:39.084 --> 24:42.124
I went to The Lamb.
We'll need to check that.

24:42.165 --> 24:45.205
By all means.

24:58.604 --> 25:00.485
Bit of a tumbleweed moment.

25:00.525 --> 25:04.525
Mm. Annie Davids?
Yes.

25:04.564 --> 25:07.324
DCI Barnaby.
DS Winter.

25:07.364 --> 25:09.525
Did Brandon Yarrow
come in last night?

25:09.564 --> 25:11.405
Yes, he did.

25:11.445 --> 25:15.205
Do you remember what sort of time?
How long he stayed?

25:15.245 --> 25:17.084
No, not really.

25:17.124 --> 25:20.364
We were busy
with the darts tournament, and...

25:20.405 --> 25:23.084
well, me and Brandon don't talk.

25:23.124 --> 25:26.765
He's your son-in-law?
In name only.

25:35.525 --> 25:38.005
Why don't you get on?

25:38.044 --> 25:41.685
This is a traditional pub
in a traditional village.

25:41.725 --> 25:46.245
Or it was before that cafe arrived.

25:46.284 --> 25:50.564
And before my daughter got all
doolally, New Age, trendy, lefty,

25:50.604 --> 25:53.245
pinko, liberal, glamping mad.

25:53.284 --> 25:58.084
Not a fan, then?
No. This about Jez's death?

25:58.124 --> 26:00.725
And that Wolf Hunter hokum?

26:00.765 --> 26:04.364
Yes, it is. Keen on that as well?

26:04.405 --> 26:07.884
Mel and Steve should be shot
for encouraging the whole thing.

26:07.925 --> 26:11.005
Shot? That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

26:11.044 --> 26:14.564
She and Steve
are as thick as thieves.

26:14.604 --> 26:16.965
Some would say more than that.

26:17.005 --> 26:21.485
Steve used to work here and...
well, we left on bad terms.

26:21.525 --> 26:23.124
Pint of your best, please, Annie.

26:25.804 --> 26:28.844
Your wife has recovered, then,
I take it, Mr Everett?

26:28.884 --> 26:33.084
She needs a drink
to steady her nerves. We both do.

26:33.124 --> 26:36.884
And a pinot for Ronnie.
Ms Davids, Mr Everett.

26:36.925 --> 26:40.005
Any luck with your searches?

26:40.044 --> 26:42.725
None whatsoever.
Aw.

26:42.765 --> 26:46.804
Never mind. Onward.

26:46.844 --> 26:49.405
How are we getting on with the
numbers for our Aunt Sally team?

26:49.445 --> 26:52.445
All signed up.
Magic.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.604
We're gonna smash them.

26:55.644 --> 26:58.925
Aren't we, Ronnie?
Course we are, love.

27:21.564 --> 27:23.564
Hey, Brandon.
Hiya.

27:28.485 --> 27:31.205
Why are you even
bothering doing that?

27:31.245 --> 27:33.765
Just trying to keep
on top of everything.

27:33.804 --> 27:35.604
It's really
gone through the roof now.

27:35.644 --> 27:37.485
It's gone too far,
is what it's done.

27:39.765 --> 27:44.044
Someone killed Jez.
You do realise that, don't you?

27:44.084 --> 27:47.965
Course I do.
But I've got to do this, I have to.

27:48.005 --> 27:50.725
Why? What's wrong with you?

27:50.765 --> 27:53.084
Lots of reasons,
and there's nothing wrong with me.

28:00.165 --> 28:04.084
Hey. What did you do that for?
Because it's sick, that's why.

28:04.124 --> 28:08.445
Ooh, catfight, like it.

28:08.485 --> 28:10.084
Get lost, you waste of space.

28:10.124 --> 28:12.284
What are you doing pretending
you can write, anyway?

28:12.324 --> 28:14.165
It's not exactly touch typing,
is it?

28:14.205 --> 28:16.804
Who are you to talk?
It's not exactly Hollywood,

28:16.844 --> 28:19.564
this place, is it?
At least I've got some dreams.

28:19.604 --> 28:21.884
Such a loser.

28:23.284 --> 28:26.205
Like I care what you think.
Because you know what?

28:26.245 --> 28:28.765
You know nothing about me.
Nothing!

28:28.804 --> 28:31.804
What's going on?
Ask her, she's lost the plot.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.525
I've just had enough, OK?
That's all.

28:33.564 --> 28:36.405
I've had enough of The Wolf Hunter,
I've had enough of this place,

28:36.445 --> 28:39.804
I've had enough of everything.
Gotta get out of here for good.

28:39.844 --> 28:42.644
Hey, come on.
No, I'm serious, Mel.

28:42.685 --> 28:46.445
This place is doing my head in.
It won't be forever.

28:46.485 --> 28:51.644
You've had a shock, we all have.
We're all upset about Jez.

28:51.685 --> 28:55.525
We're confused and frightened.

28:55.564 --> 29:01.364
But we can't let that get to us.
We've got to stick together, right?

29:01.405 --> 29:03.044
Right?

29:19.364 --> 29:22.324
The Yarrows' financials are back,
they are definitely struggling.

29:22.364 --> 29:25.604
Brandon gave up his job in marketing
to follow his wife's dreams.

29:25.644 --> 29:28.405
Strangely enough, we're not the
only ones looking into the Yarrows.

29:28.445 --> 29:30.765
Pat Everett
has been making enquiries.

29:30.804 --> 29:33.725
Maybe he's trying to push them out.
Keep digging.

29:33.765 --> 29:38.044
And also, check out
Mel Wallace and Steve Skelton.

29:38.084 --> 29:40.324
And get a tech team
over to the cafe.

29:40.364 --> 29:44.884
I want to know if that post was made
from one of their computers.

29:44.925 --> 29:48.844
Progress on the boot print,
every tread. And guess what?

29:48.884 --> 29:52.844
Brace yourselves. Two of them.

29:54.005 --> 29:57.685
The murderer had two legs?
Not so fast, sunshine.

29:57.725 --> 30:01.084
Different sizes. Different boots.

30:01.124 --> 30:02.925
Apart from the victim,

30:02.965 --> 30:05.324
there were two other people
at the murder scene.

30:05.364 --> 30:06.844
An accomplice?

30:06.884 --> 30:11.165
Or someone else came across the body
and posted about it on the website.

30:12.604 --> 30:14.765
What about the wolf paw cane
at The Hub?

30:14.804 --> 30:17.925
Was that the one in the woods?
Definitely not.

30:17.965 --> 30:22.165
The one used in woods
has a chip in it.

30:22.205 --> 30:26.245
You are looking for a wolf cane
with a broken little toe.

30:52.604 --> 30:54.445
Ow!

31:49.884 --> 31:52.685
Mr Gladberry?

31:52.725 --> 31:55.844
DCI Barnaby, Corston CID.

31:55.884 --> 31:58.564
I'm very sorry
about what happened to your son.

32:01.604 --> 32:02.925
Lovely view.

32:04.485 --> 32:06.324
My wife's favourite.

32:06.364 --> 32:08.804
Till she fell ill
and died last year.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.245
I'm very sorry to hear that too.

32:13.124 --> 32:16.604
Did you do the paintings of the
Wolf Hunter at the local exhibition?

32:16.644 --> 32:18.084
No, they're not mine.

32:22.165 --> 32:24.564
Are you going to paint
the campsite as well?

32:24.604 --> 32:26.804
I'll leave that to last.

32:26.844 --> 32:30.725
Shame it's there, really.
Spoils the view, don't you think?

32:32.284 --> 32:35.804
I've gotten used to it now.

32:37.124 --> 32:38.725
Was Jez seeing anyone?

32:38.765 --> 32:42.364
Yes. I may be old, but I'm not deaf.

32:42.405 --> 32:45.844
Do you know who?
No idea.

32:45.884 --> 32:48.765
We didn't talk much.

32:48.804 --> 32:51.124
Not since his mother died.

32:51.165 --> 32:56.925
You know. And this stuff
got a grip of me. Cheers.

33:06.124 --> 33:08.084
Jez.

33:09.804 --> 33:14.685
Ah, another bottle.
And my cane, where's my...?

33:14.725 --> 33:18.564
Please, allow me.

33:22.564 --> 33:26.364
Have you injured yourself?
Thank you.

33:26.405 --> 33:30.364
Hip replacement.
Jez made the cane for me.

33:30.405 --> 33:35.205
Do you know of any others he made?
No, can't say I do.

33:45.725 --> 33:48.005
Yes, Winter?

33:48.044 --> 33:51.124
There was no mention in his
order book of Wolf Hunter items,

33:51.165 --> 33:54.364
but check this out. It wasn't just
the photograph that was interesting.

33:54.405 --> 33:56.925
Tech got back to me
about Jez's call history.

33:56.965 --> 33:59.725
Yesterday, the same number
called him 11 times

33:59.765 --> 34:02.644
and texted to meet
in the woods last night.

34:02.685 --> 34:04.844
And that phone belongs to...?
Kelly Kirk-Lees.

34:04.884 --> 34:06.124
Oh.

34:07.604 --> 34:10.804
Excuse me.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.525
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

34:12.563 --> 34:14.005
You can ask.

34:14.043 --> 34:18.244
Where you are in a relationship
with Mr Gladberry?

34:18.284 --> 34:22.764
A what with Mr who?
What century do you think this is?

34:22.804 --> 34:24.925
We found this.

34:26.364 --> 34:29.925
Oh, that.
Friends with benefits.

34:32.083 --> 34:35.563
It's when two...
Yes, we know what that is.

34:35.603 --> 34:38.005
Would you say you and Jez
were close, then?

34:38.043 --> 34:39.284
What's it to you?

34:39.324 --> 34:42.284
You arranged to meet him
in Worthy Wood last night.

34:42.324 --> 34:46.364
We have a record of the text.
Then you must be imagining it.

34:46.405 --> 34:49.043
Here. Look.

34:49.083 --> 34:53.563
See? No text about the woods.
You could have just deleted it.

34:53.603 --> 34:55.804
I don't go anywhere
near the woods last night.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.164
I hate them. Spook me out.

34:58.204 --> 34:59.925
So where were you last night?

34:59.965 --> 35:04.164
At home, with Josie. Ask her.
We will.

35:04.204 --> 35:07.604
Sorry.

35:07.644 --> 35:10.684
Did you have your phone on you
all day yesterday?

35:10.724 --> 35:14.724
Of course. Although I do sometimes
leave it lying about if we're busy.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.285
Sir.

35:22.044 --> 35:23.445
Who lives here?

35:25.405 --> 35:27.604
Me and Josie.

35:55.325 --> 35:57.685
Cuppa, love?

35:57.725 --> 36:01.604
You making tea? Am I in heaven?

36:01.644 --> 36:06.845
Nearly, thanks to this bunch.
Best sleep I have had in ages.

36:06.885 --> 36:11.285
You were nearly fried alive,
no wonder you slept well.

36:14.805 --> 36:18.725
You going for your walk?
Yes, I think I will.

36:18.765 --> 36:20.245
Want me to come?

36:22.644 --> 36:25.205
No, I'll go my own, if that's OK.

36:31.845 --> 36:35.444
You needn't worry about a thing.
We'll have an officer here.

36:35.484 --> 36:39.524
I'm not worried. It'll just be
Wade Andow mucking about.

36:39.564 --> 36:43.325
Kelly! Kelly.
Oh, my God, we're next.

36:43.365 --> 36:45.044
It's fine, Josie,
don't worry about it.

36:45.084 --> 36:47.004
It'll just be a joke.
But what if it's not?

36:47.044 --> 36:50.564
What if we're next?
We won't be. It's OK.

36:50.604 --> 36:55.084
Can I just ask,
where were you last night?

36:55.124 --> 36:59.004
Here. In watching telly with Kel.

36:59.044 --> 37:00.925
Satisfied?

37:00.964 --> 37:02.845
Come on, Josie.

37:05.205 --> 37:06.325
Sir?

37:09.845 --> 37:11.845
The post about Jez's death

37:11.885 --> 37:14.044
was sent from one of the computers
in the cafe.

37:14.084 --> 37:17.044
By someone calling themselves
"The Wolf Slasher".

37:17.084 --> 37:21.285
I'll go there.
You take those boots back to Fleur.

37:21.325 --> 37:24.325
Let's see if any of them match
the prints she found in the woods.

37:24.365 --> 37:26.765
Sir.

37:29.685 --> 37:30.964
I'm so sorry.

37:31.004 --> 37:34.325
I have no idea
who The Wolf Slasher is.

37:34.365 --> 37:37.365
People make up names all the time.

37:37.405 --> 37:40.925
So when the cafe's open,
anyone can use this computer?

37:40.964 --> 37:44.084
Yes.
Do you have CCTV?

37:44.124 --> 37:45.925
No, I'm afraid not.

37:48.084 --> 37:51.245
This was posted at 8:13am,
what time do you open?

37:51.285 --> 37:52.964
Nine.

37:53.004 --> 37:57.964
So whoever left this
was here before opening time.

37:58.004 --> 37:59.524
Does anyone else have keys?

37:59.564 --> 38:05.365
Um... Steve sort of does as he's
living on site at the moment.

38:05.405 --> 38:08.685
I'm going to need a word with him.

38:15.604 --> 38:17.564
Mr Skelton?

38:22.245 --> 38:23.845
DCI Barnaby.

38:28.084 --> 38:30.564
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

38:30.604 --> 38:33.245
Out taking photos, probably.

38:33.285 --> 38:36.925
Ah, there was a cash prize
for the competition.

38:36.964 --> 38:39.124
Who paid for that?
I did.

38:39.164 --> 38:40.925
Very generous of you.

38:42.164 --> 38:45.124
Are you and Mr Skelton involved?

38:45.164 --> 38:49.805
No. Contrary to popular opinion,
we're just friends.

38:49.845 --> 38:53.685
I'm not one to take chances
on the roulette wheel of love.

38:53.725 --> 38:55.365
You're a very generous friend,

38:55.405 --> 38:57.564
providing him
with somewhere to live,

38:57.604 --> 39:00.644
letting him win the competition.
His was the best entry.

39:02.604 --> 39:05.044
I spoke with the landlady
at The Lamb.

39:05.084 --> 39:06.444
Oh, hard luck.

39:06.484 --> 39:09.205
I gather Mr Skelton
used to work there.

39:09.245 --> 39:11.044
He quit.
Because...?

39:11.084 --> 39:14.164
Well, Annie is best friends
with Steve's ex, Rachel,

39:14.205 --> 39:15.964
who I get wasn't happy.

39:16.004 --> 39:20.285
But then Annie encouraged Rachel
to dump him and do a runner,

39:20.325 --> 39:24.004
leaving him with all this debt
and Josie to look out for.

39:24.044 --> 39:26.885
It's been a real struggle.
But he's tried his best.

39:26.925 --> 39:30.885
And yet he still keeps
her photograph.

39:30.925 --> 39:32.685
He still sends her money.

39:32.725 --> 39:34.205
He's crazy about her.

39:34.245 --> 39:37.124
He even thinks that she might
come back one day.

39:37.164 --> 39:39.285
She won't.

39:39.325 --> 39:41.885
Especially if Annie
keeps bad-mouthing him.

39:41.925 --> 39:43.845
We'll get our revenge, though.

39:43.885 --> 39:45.644
Excuse me?

39:45.685 --> 39:48.964
It's the annual
Battle Of Aunt Sally tomorrow.

39:49.004 --> 39:50.964
Ah, I see.

39:51.004 --> 39:53.644
Does Mr Skelton
sell these photographs?

39:53.685 --> 39:55.205
If he can.

39:55.245 --> 39:58.444
Steve does anything
to bring in whatever he can.

39:58.484 --> 40:02.004
So it's very much in his interests
for the myth to grow.

40:03.885 --> 40:06.044
I suppose.

40:06.084 --> 40:08.765
When he comes back,
please get him to contact me.

40:08.805 --> 40:10.365
Yes, of course.

40:39.164 --> 40:43.644
Steve Skelton, wherever he is, seems
most likely to have posted the news.

40:43.685 --> 40:47.325
But why target Jez?
And if you're the murderer,

40:47.365 --> 40:50.765
then why advertise the fact
by posting as The Wolf Slasher?

40:50.805 --> 40:54.604
To create an atmosphere
of fear and paranoia, maybe.

40:54.644 --> 40:56.004
What else?

40:56.044 --> 40:59.164
We know that Kelly Kirk-Lees,
or someone using her phone,

40:59.205 --> 41:01.444
lured the victim into the woods.

41:01.484 --> 41:07.845
That could be anyone that uses The
Hub, which is pretty much everyone.

41:07.885 --> 41:10.964
How are we doing on the boots?
Perfect match, actually.

41:11.004 --> 41:13.164
Who do they belong to?

41:13.205 --> 41:17.644
According to the label...
Whose writing is this?

41:17.685 --> 41:19.164
Mine.

41:21.885 --> 41:23.524
Kelly Kirk-Lees.

41:25.685 --> 41:27.164
Yes, I'm on it.

41:30.484 --> 41:31.685
Kel?

41:33.564 --> 41:35.405
Kel?

41:45.205 --> 41:47.765
PC: All clear at the moment, over.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.444
Kel?

43:52.084 --> 43:55.805
Oi! Oi!

44:03.725 --> 44:05.084
No! No!

44:36.924 --> 44:38.924
Same wolf cane, with a broken toe.

44:41.364 --> 44:43.245
And same boots.

44:44.444 --> 44:47.044
That we haven't been able
to identify yet.

44:48.444 --> 44:50.605
Only, these are a stronger imprint.

44:51.765 --> 44:55.165
So let's hope these ones
were made for talking.

44:55.205 --> 44:59.805
Indeed. And a funeral wreath.

44:59.844 --> 45:03.125
What was in her rucksack?
Cash and clothes.

45:04.964 --> 45:07.125
Looks like she was leaving
the village, poor thing.

45:07.165 --> 45:08.325
Or trying to.

45:08.364 --> 45:11.205
Kelly Kirk-Lees' family have been
informed, they live in Scotland.

45:11.245 --> 45:12.245
Er...

45:15.205 --> 45:17.205
Sorry.

45:17.245 --> 45:21.444
So, what was Kelly doing at the
scene of Jez Gladberry's murder?

45:21.484 --> 45:24.964
Assuming she was the one
wearing the boots.

45:25.004 --> 45:28.564
Where's her flatmate, Josie Skelton?
She was found nearby, distressed.

45:28.605 --> 45:30.404
She's with her father,
Steve Skelton.

45:30.444 --> 45:31.924
We need to talk to him anyway.

45:31.964 --> 45:35.844
Not least to find out if this
camera's his. Found it on a wall.

45:35.884 --> 45:38.524
Yes, it is my camera.
Can I have it back?

45:38.564 --> 45:40.484
All in good time.

45:40.524 --> 45:43.285
Someone posted from the cafe
yesterday morning

45:43.325 --> 45:48.285
about Jez Gladberry's murder.
Under the name of The Wolf Slasher.

45:48.325 --> 45:50.325
Was that you?
No.

45:50.364 --> 45:53.444
I was out early with that camera
trying to capture the sunrise.

45:53.484 --> 45:56.245
Nowhere near the woods.
Can anyone verify that?

45:56.285 --> 45:58.564
I was on my own.
What about last night?

46:00.484 --> 46:03.285
I was trying to stage
some shots of The Wolf Hunter.

46:03.325 --> 46:06.044
The camera was on a timer, I was
walking in front of it for a shot

46:06.085 --> 46:08.564
when your headlights turned on me.
It was you that I chased.

46:08.605 --> 46:12.364
Yes. I ran back to the flat.

46:12.404 --> 46:14.685
Via the churchyard
and Kelly Kirk-Lees.

46:14.725 --> 46:15.884
No!

46:15.924 --> 46:17.564
You can see why
we might think otherwise.

46:17.605 --> 46:20.004
Kelly Kirk-Lees
was murdered at a time

46:20.044 --> 46:23.564
when you were in the vicinity,
dressed just like the man himself.

46:23.605 --> 46:25.524
Tell us about
the cuts on your hands.

46:25.564 --> 46:27.404
I fell when he was chasing me.

46:27.444 --> 46:30.805
Look, if I was a killer,
why would I take photos?

46:30.844 --> 46:32.964
Trust me, you wouldn't be the first.

46:33.004 --> 46:36.364
What were you hoping to achieve
with the photographs anyway?

46:36.404 --> 46:38.805
To keep the myth alive?
What does it matter?

46:38.844 --> 46:42.245
The Wolf Hunter's mine.
I came up with it, I can do I want.

46:42.285 --> 46:44.884
Not really, Dad.
Yes, really.

46:46.924 --> 46:50.484
It was my original idea, everyone
else just surfed on the back of it.

46:50.524 --> 46:52.645
I thought that was the point.

46:52.685 --> 46:53.685
It is.
Josie, please!

46:53.725 --> 46:55.564
No, Dad,
you can't just take credit...

46:55.605 --> 46:58.765
Yes, I can! I have to.

46:58.805 --> 47:02.245
You don't understand.
I did it for you.

47:02.285 --> 47:03.444
For financial gain?

47:06.964 --> 47:08.205
Yeah, I'm skint, OK?

47:09.564 --> 47:13.484
I thought if I had some shots,
some real ones, then...

47:14.964 --> 47:17.364
..I could sell them.
And you knew people would pay more

47:17.404 --> 47:19.924
if they felt they'd seen
the murderer in action.

47:19.964 --> 47:22.364
Highly ethical (!)
Hey, I'm desperate, OK?

47:22.404 --> 47:24.605
You're doing all this for money?

47:24.645 --> 47:29.245
And to get your mum back.
You know that's never gonna happen.

47:34.484 --> 47:37.044
Did you know Kelly
was leaving the village?

47:38.364 --> 47:42.645
Not really.
Why did you follow her?

47:42.685 --> 47:44.404
I'm not sure. I...

47:46.285 --> 47:50.605
How serious were Jez and Kelly?
They were pretty new.

47:50.645 --> 47:54.444
But, yeah, they were going for it.

47:54.484 --> 47:57.964
There was talk
about them moving in together.

47:58.004 --> 48:04.285
How did you get on with Jez?
Me? Yeah, he was all right.

48:04.325 --> 48:07.725
You and Kelly were good friends.

48:09.004 --> 48:10.444
Did you ever share clothes?

48:10.484 --> 48:12.605
Sometimes.

48:12.645 --> 48:13.805
What about boots?

48:16.605 --> 48:17.844
No.

48:25.564 --> 48:27.725
If Jez's relationship with Kelly
was serious,

48:27.765 --> 48:31.484
then we could just be talking about
a case of jealous lover.

48:31.524 --> 48:33.524
Rowan Yarrow?
Possibly.

48:33.564 --> 48:36.245
I think something else is going on,
though.

48:36.285 --> 48:39.044
The slashing, the gunshot,
why use the myth?

48:39.085 --> 48:42.524
It's like they want
some kind of vengeance.

48:42.564 --> 48:44.844
So what do we do now?

48:44.884 --> 48:47.805
Well, it's early
and we've been up all night,

48:47.844 --> 48:51.725
so I'll pop home
and you can hold the fort here.

49:03.125 --> 49:07.645
You slept in.
I never!

49:07.685 --> 49:09.805
Don't be ridiculous.

49:11.725 --> 49:14.685
Bloody hell.

49:14.725 --> 49:19.725
Must be all that stress.
Or beer.

49:19.765 --> 49:22.645
Or you like the bed.

49:26.884 --> 49:30.404
Pat, I've been thinking.
Uh-oh.

49:30.444 --> 49:34.085
We tried everything,
nothing's worked.

49:35.564 --> 49:37.285
Everything's changing.

49:40.044 --> 49:43.404
I think this has to be
the last year we come here.

49:45.165 --> 49:46.645
It's over.

49:53.964 --> 49:55.924
Oh!

49:57.004 --> 49:58.564
Bother me.

49:58.605 --> 50:02.165
What...? You're gonna give me
a heart attack!

50:13.044 --> 50:19.044
I don't know, gone all night?
Blame Winter. He leads me astray.

50:20.924 --> 50:22.044
You OK?

50:22.085 --> 50:26.044
If I could figure out
what was going on.

50:27.964 --> 50:31.765
The key is somehow buried
in the myth of The Wolf Hunter.

50:31.805 --> 50:36.285
{\an8}I just can't quite fathom
what it is.

50:36.325 --> 50:38.725
{\an8}Well, what do you need to know?

50:38.765 --> 50:42.044
{\an8}I spent half the night reading
the kids' local history projects,

50:42.085 --> 50:44.444
{\an8}and The Wolf Hunter
featured pretty heavily.

50:44.484 --> 50:47.404
{\an8}Why would he appeal to kids?

50:47.444 --> 50:52.524
{\an8}This is someone who goes
around killing people, and wolves.

50:52.564 --> 50:56.765
{\an8}But he's conflicted. I think the
kids respond to his vulnerability.

50:56.805 --> 50:59.444
{\an8}Vulnerability?
I'm clearly missing something.

50:59.484 --> 51:02.205
{\an8}He was abandoned as a child
by his family.

51:02.245 --> 51:05.484
Left in the woods
on the night of the full moon.

51:05.524 --> 51:07.004
Abandoned because...?

51:07.044 --> 51:09.205
The wolves were closing in
and his family fled.

51:09.245 --> 51:10.924
Then the wolves brought him up.

51:10.964 --> 51:16.205
So the wolf is both
predator and protector?

51:16.245 --> 51:19.484
Exactly. The Wolf Hunter is torn
between loving and hating

51:19.524 --> 51:21.444
both of his families.

51:21.484 --> 51:25.325
That's why even someone like
Wade Andow can relate to him.

51:25.364 --> 51:27.924
Do you know him?
Yeah, he was a pupil of ours.

51:27.964 --> 51:30.484
But we had to let him go.
He's in the paper.

51:30.524 --> 51:33.725
Talking about finding the body.

51:33.765 --> 51:36.564
He lashed out at a teacher
he thought was looking down on him.

51:36.605 --> 51:41.645
He was very sensitive boy,
with a really bad attitude.

51:41.685 --> 51:44.484
It was such a shame.
He was talented.

51:44.524 --> 51:46.685
He showed real potential
as an artist.

51:51.044 --> 51:52.444
Thanks for the call, Mark.

52:29.765 --> 52:32.165
You've clearly heard the news.

52:38.325 --> 52:43.444
You and Kelly were obviously close.

52:43.484 --> 52:46.004
How long had you known her?

52:46.044 --> 52:48.364
I've sort of always known of her.

52:48.404 --> 52:53.564
I came here 18 years ago, that was
the summer that she was born.

52:53.605 --> 52:55.165
And then a few years ago,

52:55.205 --> 52:58.805
she just swung into the cafe
demanding a job.

53:00.524 --> 53:04.765
Do you have any idea why she was
leaving, or where she was going?

53:04.805 --> 53:09.004
London.
Yeah, she always talked about it.

53:09.044 --> 53:11.605
She dreamt of bigger things
than Little Worthy.

53:14.364 --> 53:16.645
And why would she
go through with it now?

53:16.685 --> 53:22.325
Because of what happened to Jez,
I guess. She loved him to bits.

53:22.364 --> 53:26.685
Can you think of anyone who might
have had a grudge against either Jez

53:26.725 --> 53:28.924
or Kelly? Or both?

53:28.964 --> 53:35.805
No. No, they got on with everyone.
Well, Kelly didn't. But...

53:35.844 --> 53:39.884
she kind of treated everyone
with equal contempt.

53:43.404 --> 53:47.325
What about Rowan Yarrow.
How was Kelly about her?

53:47.364 --> 53:50.685
Fireworks, those two.

53:50.725 --> 53:53.444
All that New Age-y stuff
wound Kel right up.

53:53.484 --> 53:57.484
And she also thought that
Rowan was after Jez.

54:01.484 --> 54:03.205
Excuse me.

54:05.725 --> 54:07.844
Yes, Winter.

54:07.884 --> 54:12.805
I'm in Jez Gladberry's workshop.
It's been broken into

54:12.844 --> 54:16.524
and I think I know
what's been taken.

54:16.564 --> 54:19.725
Bolt cutters.

54:27.444 --> 54:30.404
What are you doing?

54:30.444 --> 54:35.844
It's black tourmaline.
Good for soaking up negative energy.

54:37.205 --> 54:38.205
Oh, right.

54:39.805 --> 54:42.364
Jez Gladberry.

54:42.404 --> 54:44.805
Did you know that he was seeing
Kelly Kirk-Lees?

54:46.605 --> 54:50.964
Yes. Yes, I did. He confided in me.

54:51.004 --> 54:55.205
He was stressing about his father,
life, love.

54:55.245 --> 54:59.205
I suggested I do some Reiki healing.
He told me about Kelly.

54:59.245 --> 55:02.924
I'm so sorry to hear about
what's happened.

55:02.964 --> 55:05.884
Did you know Miss Kirk-Lees?

55:05.924 --> 55:09.205
A bit, from The Hub. She was...

55:09.245 --> 55:12.364
quite a live wire.

55:12.404 --> 55:15.205
Indeed.

55:15.245 --> 55:20.725
And why was Mr Gladberry stressing?
You mentioned love.

55:20.765 --> 55:23.325
I got the impression he might have
been seeing someone else,

55:23.364 --> 55:24.884
apart from Kelly.

55:24.924 --> 55:29.125
I'm going to need a little bit more
than that, I'm afraid, Mrs Yarrow.

55:29.165 --> 55:31.325
Were you fond of Mr Gladberry?

55:31.364 --> 55:35.564
Perhaps jealous of his
growing relationship with Kelly?

55:35.605 --> 55:36.685
No, of course not.

55:41.884 --> 55:44.364
After all the things
I've done for you.

55:44.404 --> 55:46.564
These people
have done nothing to me.

55:46.605 --> 55:49.725
They have to me. They have to go.
How many more?

55:49.765 --> 55:51.085
Until it's over.

55:51.125 --> 55:55.044
And when will that be?
Soon!

56:06.564 --> 56:09.685
Come on, Wade.

56:09.725 --> 56:11.725
Just one more.

56:11.765 --> 56:13.484
That's all.

56:51.605 --> 56:54.165
Hey.

56:54.205 --> 56:57.924
How's business? Thriving?

56:57.964 --> 57:01.404
Not great, to be honest.
I told you.

57:01.444 --> 57:04.284
Little Worthy isn't ready
for fancy camping.

57:04.324 --> 57:07.005
We'll see. Come on, Bran.

57:07.045 --> 57:09.205
Way too much negativity
around here.

57:12.324 --> 57:16.645
Right, to the victor, the spoils.
And what lovely spoils they are.

57:16.685 --> 57:18.804
Great big keg of Best Bitter.

57:18.844 --> 57:22.844
Right, let's show this shower
who's boss round here.

57:22.884 --> 57:25.165
Ronnie?

57:30.485 --> 57:32.045
Missed by a whisker!

57:32.085 --> 57:34.725
Whisker.
By a country mile, more like.

57:34.764 --> 57:39.764
You do know that you are supposed
to actually hit the target?

57:39.804 --> 57:41.444
Watch it, you.

57:42.605 --> 57:46.165
Come on, Mel, you've got this.

57:50.565 --> 57:54.404
Pat Everett's been contacting
the property companies in the area.

57:54.444 --> 57:56.804
You think they're trying to
drive them out and take over?

57:56.844 --> 57:59.045
Could the murders be
something to do with that?

57:59.085 --> 58:01.045
Not much of a motive, though, is it?

58:01.085 --> 58:03.045
Murder's hardly good for business,
is it?

58:03.085 --> 58:05.964
Two deaths in the village
will be the end of Yarrow Gl...

58:06.005 --> 58:07.685
Camping.

58:07.725 --> 58:12.565
Let's call it by its proper name,
shall we? It's a glampsite, Winter.

58:12.605 --> 58:17.045
You see, language is a living,
breathing thing.

58:17.085 --> 58:19.444
That's part of the beauty of it.

58:24.165 --> 58:25.924
What do we know about Mr Everett?

58:25.964 --> 58:28.685
Self-made man.
He's been coming here for years.

58:28.725 --> 58:31.125
His wife goes off
for walks on her own.

58:31.165 --> 58:34.964
I mean, you think she could be
capable of killing someone?

58:35.005 --> 58:38.605
Let's find out where Ronnie Everett
goes on her walks.

58:39.645 --> 58:45.404
Oi! You two, stop gawping.
Come here.

58:53.605 --> 58:56.844
Can we have him instead?
No, you can't.

59:13.804 --> 59:15.924
Good luck.

59:17.444 --> 59:22.444
I might have something for you.
Can't you see we're busy detecting?

59:22.485 --> 59:27.005
Love an Aunt Sally, me.

59:27.045 --> 59:29.205
Well, don't just stand there.

59:29.244 --> 59:32.725
Have my go. The elbow's playing up.

59:57.244 --> 01:00:02.444
Yes!

01:00:06.764 --> 01:00:08.725
It's all about technique, Winter.

01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:14.444
Wallop. By jingo,
you've got some gumption.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.605
Thanks!

01:00:16.645 --> 01:00:18.804
I think.

01:00:18.844 --> 01:00:20.764
Bye.

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:27.364
Oh, thank you.

01:00:34.525 --> 01:00:39.005
I can confirm Kelly Kirk-Lees
was shot with a silver bullet.

01:00:39.045 --> 01:00:42.284
Fired from a real gun?
Very much so.

01:00:42.324 --> 01:00:47.244
And not the one at The Hub,
confirmed as a fake yesterday.

01:00:47.284 --> 01:00:51.284
Also, had a bit of time
over a cuppa, so I thought I'd read

01:00:51.324 --> 01:00:54.165
Josie Skelton's blog
about The Wolf Hunter.

01:00:54.205 --> 01:00:55.565
And?

01:00:55.605 --> 01:00:58.324
The phrasing is remarkably similar

01:00:58.364 --> 01:01:01.364
to the phrasing used
by The Wolf Slasher.

01:01:12.924 --> 01:01:16.165
Thank you. Well, I guess
there's always next year.

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:19.844
I don't know why we bother.
Oh, that's the spirit

01:01:23.645 --> 01:01:25.764
What's going on?

01:01:25.804 --> 01:01:29.685
What are you doing?
I've had enough!

01:01:29.725 --> 01:01:32.404
I hate everything about this!
Kelly was right!

01:01:32.444 --> 01:01:34.964
It's gone too far! And no-one cares!

01:01:35.005 --> 01:01:37.884
Oi! I put a lot of work into this!
Yeah, just to make money.

01:01:37.924 --> 01:01:41.525
To get your mum back!
No, no, no. No.

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:44.964
To get us all back on track.
So we can be together again.

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.964
Don't touch me!

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.565
You don't get it, do you?

01:01:50.605 --> 01:01:55.764
Mum is never coming back! She
doesn't want to be here with you.

01:01:55.804 --> 01:01:57.005
Don't you dare say that!

01:01:57.045 --> 01:02:00.485
Steve, stop it. Leave it.

01:02:00.525 --> 01:02:02.764
OK? Just let her go.

01:02:10.924 --> 01:02:13.764
It's OK, Josie.
She's gone, Mel.

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:17.284
I'm so sorry.

01:02:35.884 --> 01:02:37.525
Popping out.

01:02:39.045 --> 01:02:45.085
As you wish, love. And later...
shall we go to the pub, hey?

01:02:47.924 --> 01:02:54.364
Seeing as we're off tomorrow
and maybe... aren't coming back...

01:02:56.525 --> 01:02:58.165
..this could be the last time.

01:03:00.725 --> 01:03:04.005
Shall I join you?
Yes.

01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:08.005
Yes, I would like that.

01:03:38.165 --> 01:03:41.165
Hello?
In here.

01:03:49.844 --> 01:03:51.964
Exhibition finished?

01:03:52.005 --> 01:03:55.964
Well, I think we've all had enough
of The Wolf Hunter now, don't you?

01:03:56.005 --> 01:03:58.605
Can I help you?

01:03:58.645 --> 01:04:03.364
Actually, it's Josie
I need to speak to.

01:04:04.645 --> 01:04:06.764
In your blog about The Wolf Hunter,

01:04:06.804 --> 01:04:13.685
you refer to his claws
being like "silver, shining talons".

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:17.924
The Wolf Slasher,
reporting Jez Gladberry's death,

01:04:17.964 --> 01:04:21.605
said he was ripped by

01:04:21.645 --> 01:04:25.005
"silver, shining talons".

01:04:25.045 --> 01:04:27.045
Funny, that. Isn't it?

01:04:29.485 --> 01:04:32.444
So you could have
borrowed Kelly's boots,

01:04:32.485 --> 01:04:36.924
which potentially places you near
the scene of Jez Gladberry's murder,

01:04:36.964 --> 01:04:40.085
and you were very much
in the vicinity of Kelly's.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:46.205
So, were you are in the woods
the night before last? The truth.

01:04:48.364 --> 01:04:53.324
It was you who found Jez's body
and posted about it online.

01:04:53.364 --> 01:04:56.645
Did you see or hear anything?
No.

01:04:56.685 --> 01:04:59.645
But I didn't arrive till later.
Wade...

01:05:02.924 --> 01:05:07.444
Wade left early next morning
because he's like that.

01:05:07.485 --> 01:05:11.045
So you and Wade are an item.
God, no.

01:05:12.444 --> 01:05:15.125
Kind of.

01:05:15.165 --> 01:05:17.924
I like him loads,
but he's not into me.

01:05:17.964 --> 01:05:19.605
I see.

01:05:19.645 --> 01:05:22.444
How did you get into The Hub?

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:26.045
Dad gave me a set of keys
in case I ever needed them.

01:05:30.884 --> 01:05:33.444
You said you didn't get to the woods
until late.

01:05:33.485 --> 01:05:37.324
Was Wade already there
when you arrived?

01:05:37.364 --> 01:05:42.764
Yes. He said he'd been there ages
putting up the... tent.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:47.364
Tragic.
Seeing it go to ruination.

01:07:21.685 --> 01:07:24.924
Wade who?
Andow.

01:07:24.964 --> 01:07:30.244
To whom you have lent easels and
paint and presumably your expertise.

01:07:30.284 --> 01:07:35.005
Have you taken him under your wing?
Well, someone had to.

01:07:37.045 --> 01:07:39.964
The boy has a talent.

01:07:40.005 --> 01:07:42.165
Just needed bringing out, you know?

01:07:44.364 --> 01:07:47.844
You know, I always thought
that Jez might pick up the brush,

01:07:47.884 --> 01:07:50.844
but he didn't.
Wasted his potential.

01:07:50.884 --> 01:07:53.804
An odd-job man and smithy!

01:07:55.804 --> 01:07:58.804
Each to his own, Mr Gladberry.

01:07:58.844 --> 01:08:01.005
Customary
when painting the landscape to paint

01:08:01.045 --> 01:08:03.485
everything that's there, isn't it?

01:08:03.525 --> 01:08:06.645
An artist can do as he pleases.

01:08:06.685 --> 01:08:11.485
Still, to do so many
and not to include the campsite,

01:08:11.525 --> 01:08:14.764
what is it about that view,
Mr Gladberry?

01:08:14.804 --> 01:08:16.685
Your wife's favourite, you say.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.924
We used to sit outside
and look at it.

01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:22.163
And they were building
that damned site.

01:08:22.203 --> 01:08:24.004
She couldn't even die in peace?

01:08:24.044 --> 01:08:27.685
Is that why you're sabotaging
the site? Or getting Wade to?

01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:29.884
What is the point
in developing his talents

01:08:29.924 --> 01:08:32.804
if you're just going to persuade him
to commit crimes?

01:08:32.844 --> 01:08:35.365
I just wanted that place gone!

01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:40.044
Mr Gladberry, where is Wade now?

01:08:53.245 --> 01:08:54.444
Sir.

01:08:58.764 --> 01:09:01.524
Wait! Don't go any further.

01:09:01.564 --> 01:09:06.444
It's not safe. Come down.

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:54.885
Presumably it was you
who broke into Jez's workshop

01:09:54.925 --> 01:09:56.885
and stole the bolt cutters?

01:09:56.925 --> 01:10:03.685
As well as going online and posting
bad reviews of Yarrow Glamping.

01:10:03.725 --> 01:10:07.484
Did you also take a gun
from the workshop?

01:10:07.524 --> 01:10:08.524
No.

01:10:08.564 --> 01:10:11.925
What about killing two people
in the manner of The Wolf Hunter?

01:10:11.965 --> 01:10:13.324
No, of course not.

01:10:13.364 --> 01:10:16.484
But you were in the woods
the night Jez was killed.

01:10:19.364 --> 01:10:24.204
I hear you have a lot of talent.

01:10:24.244 --> 01:10:29.204
Why would you waste it? For money?
Was Mr Gladberry paying you?

01:10:29.244 --> 01:10:32.444
No. I just owed it to him.

01:10:32.484 --> 01:10:36.965
He didn't mean to hurt anyone,
he just wants the campsite shutdown.

01:10:37.005 --> 01:10:39.404
You could have said no.
I could have,

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:41.125
but do you know what it's like?

01:10:41.164 --> 01:10:44.645
To have everyone think you are
a no-mark loser

01:10:44.685 --> 01:10:47.484
who'll do nothing with their life?

01:10:47.524 --> 01:10:50.324
Eric was good to me.

01:10:50.364 --> 01:10:52.965
He took me under his wing,
encouraged me.

01:10:53.005 --> 01:10:55.364
And he was broken
after his wife died.

01:10:55.404 --> 01:10:59.805
How did Jez feel
about your friendship with his dad?

01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:02.444
Jez didn't care.
He had other things on his mind.

01:11:02.484 --> 01:11:05.324
Like what?

01:11:05.364 --> 01:11:08.244
Women.
Plural?

01:11:08.284 --> 01:11:11.284
Kelly Kirk-Lees and...?

01:11:11.324 --> 01:11:13.484
Who else?

01:11:13.524 --> 01:11:18.885
I don't know, but he'd been
seeing someone else for ages.

01:11:18.925 --> 01:11:21.444
Just thank God no-one was injured,
to be honest.

01:11:21.484 --> 01:11:24.645
Thanks, Bran.
Hang on a second.

01:11:27.364 --> 01:11:30.645
What's going on?

01:11:30.685 --> 01:11:33.604
I don't understand. Who fixed it?

01:11:34.925 --> 01:11:38.564
It were just your flange
and sprocket mechanism.

01:11:38.604 --> 01:11:40.885
And your widget needed unblocking.

01:11:40.925 --> 01:11:43.404
How do you know about...
Pumps, lad. Pumps.

01:11:43.444 --> 01:11:45.965
That's where I made my money.

01:11:46.005 --> 01:11:49.965
You can't hammer a nail in
over the internet.

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.364
You can knock it off the bill.

01:11:51.404 --> 01:11:56.484
Oh, tell him, love.
Tell him what?

01:11:56.524 --> 01:12:00.564
That angel investor
you've been in touch with.

01:12:00.604 --> 01:12:02.564
You're looking at him.
What?

01:12:02.604 --> 01:12:04.484
No way.

01:12:04.524 --> 01:12:08.885
I only invest in the best,
that's why I were testing you.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.085
I don't understand.
You hate glamping.

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:12.324
Aye.

01:12:12.364 --> 01:12:17.324
But I love Ronnie,
and I love it round here.

01:12:17.364 --> 01:12:19.324
We were going to move here
permanently,

01:12:19.364 --> 01:12:21.725
but we've changed our mind.

01:12:21.765 --> 01:12:23.284
Because of us.
No.

01:12:23.324 --> 01:12:28.444
No, no. It's just time for us
to move on. We wish you well.

01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:32.484
We'd better be getting on.

01:12:32.524 --> 01:12:34.244
Got us goodbyes to do.

01:12:38.845 --> 01:12:41.085
We'll keep in touch.

01:12:45.845 --> 01:12:48.805
Sir. I checked the properties that
the Everetts have been looking at.

01:12:48.845 --> 01:12:51.324
It's Daisy Cottage.
It's been empty for years.

01:12:51.364 --> 01:12:53.805
So, did one of them
used to live there, or...

01:12:53.845 --> 01:12:56.564
do they want to buy it?
It's listed to a holding company,

01:12:56.604 --> 01:12:59.125
but we'll find out
who's behind that.

01:12:59.164 --> 01:13:01.965
The Everetts have been coming here
for decades, haven't they?

01:13:02.005 --> 01:13:04.805
36 years. Ronnie Everett
was very specific about that.

01:13:04.845 --> 01:13:07.725
The previous owners
used it as a rental property.

01:13:07.765 --> 01:13:12.085
Maybe they stayed there once.
Your holiday snaps are back. Winter?

01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:15.444
Thank you.
AKA Mr Skelton's film.

01:13:15.484 --> 01:13:17.324
I think you'll like them.

01:13:25.524 --> 01:13:30.805
What's that?
Here. Thought you'd like that bit.

01:13:30.845 --> 01:13:33.045
So I had it enlarged.

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:40.085
Another Wolf Hunter.
The real one.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:43.244
So Steve Skelton was telling
the truth, he isn't The Wolf Hunter.

01:13:43.284 --> 01:13:45.204
So who is?

01:13:45.244 --> 01:13:47.645
Well, I have more
on the boot prints.

01:13:47.685 --> 01:13:49.324
They belong to someone

01:13:49.364 --> 01:13:51.965
who repeatedly puts
a lot of weight on one side.

01:13:52.005 --> 01:13:54.244
Someone with a consistent limp.

01:13:56.244 --> 01:13:59.685
Thank you, Annie.
Oh, you shouldn't have.

01:13:59.725 --> 01:14:01.404
Well, it's only me.

01:14:01.444 --> 01:14:04.005
We're gonna miss you so much,
you know.

01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:07.725
Thank you, you've always been
so kind to us.

01:14:07.765 --> 01:14:10.805
Mr Gladberry.

01:14:10.845 --> 01:14:12.564
Did you find Wade?

01:14:12.604 --> 01:14:15.284
Yes, indeed. Just in time.

01:14:15.324 --> 01:14:19.845
He's been charged over trying to
sabotage Yarrow Glamping,

01:14:19.885 --> 01:14:21.564
as you will be.

01:14:24.204 --> 01:14:28.564
But first, I'd like to ask you
about a pair of boots you own.

01:14:28.604 --> 01:14:32.204
Heavy tread?
Have you found them?

01:14:32.244 --> 01:14:33.524
Excuse me?

01:14:33.564 --> 01:14:36.244
My hip's been killing me
without them.

01:14:36.284 --> 01:14:40.524
They just disappeared from my house.
Well, who took them?

01:14:40.564 --> 01:14:45.125
I don't know. I asked Jez about it
and he said he didn't know either.

01:14:45.164 --> 01:14:47.284
But you know what?

01:14:47.324 --> 01:14:51.085
I figure it's most probably
someone he's seeing.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:54.404
You never met this person,
but you sometimes heard them.

01:14:54.444 --> 01:14:57.604
When were they last there?

01:14:57.645 --> 01:14:59.204
Three nights ago.

01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:01.965
Did you hear anything specific,
like a row?

01:15:02.005 --> 01:15:07.045
No. But I was pretty out of it
at the time.

01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:08.765
So...

01:15:10.444 --> 01:15:15.725
Are the Everetts leaving?
Sadly. Salt of the earth, those two.

01:15:15.765 --> 01:15:19.204
I gather they were interested in
a cottage in the woods.

01:15:19.244 --> 01:15:20.404
Any idea why?

01:15:20.444 --> 01:15:24.645
They stayed there the first time,
the entire summer.

01:15:24.685 --> 01:15:26.965
They're definitely gonna be missed.

01:15:27.005 --> 01:15:28.925
You talk as if
they're never coming back.

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:31.885
They're not.
They're leaving for good.

01:15:33.885 --> 01:15:38.085
This photograph.
From that first summer.

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:40.524
We thought they'd be back next time
with a little 'un.

01:15:40.564 --> 01:15:44.765
But they weren't. And no mention.

01:15:46.045 --> 01:15:50.765
We thought they'd lost the child,
didn't really like to ask.

01:15:50.805 --> 01:15:53.524
Well, you don't, do you?

01:15:59.965 --> 01:16:02.125
Sir.

01:16:02.164 --> 01:16:04.965
Take Mr Gladberry to the station

01:16:05.005 --> 01:16:08.444
and charge him over the damage
to Yarrow Glamping.

01:16:08.484 --> 01:16:12.845
And find out when the current owner
bought that cottage in the woods.

01:16:12.885 --> 01:16:14.885
Will do. Where are you going?

01:16:14.925 --> 01:16:20.444
To see if Josie Skelton has any idea
who else Jez Gladberry was seeing.

01:16:22.164 --> 01:16:27.805
Sorry, we're not... Oh! Hello.
We're heading off later.

01:16:27.845 --> 01:16:30.564
Oh, well, I'll see you next time.

01:16:30.604 --> 01:16:32.364
Not sure you will.

01:16:32.404 --> 01:16:36.765
All that glamping. I thought...

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:40.564
We thought we could hack it,
but it's not to be.

01:16:40.604 --> 01:16:43.885
Me and that Brandon are chalk and
cheese, so we won't be coming back.

01:16:43.925 --> 01:16:47.244
We wanted to give you
just a little present

01:16:47.284 --> 01:16:50.204
to say thank you for
all the cups of tea over the years.

01:16:50.244 --> 01:16:52.125
Oh, thank you.

01:16:52.164 --> 01:16:55.244
Ronnie's read that cover-to-cover
about a million times.

01:16:55.284 --> 01:16:57.484
We thought it were time
to pass it on.

01:16:57.524 --> 01:17:00.925
Well,
it belongs here in the village.

01:17:07.885 --> 01:17:11.204
Well, cheerio.
Bye.

01:17:13.444 --> 01:17:14.885
Bye-bye, love.

01:17:24.324 --> 01:17:25.925
Wow.

01:17:38.085 --> 01:17:40.244
Kel never went near
the Gladberry's house.

01:17:40.284 --> 01:17:44.284
She was scared of Mr Gladberry.
If she saw Jez, she saw him here.

01:17:45.685 --> 01:17:49.005
Have you any idea who else
Jez might have been seeing?

01:17:49.045 --> 01:17:51.685
Someone less scared
of Mr Gladberry, perhaps.

01:17:51.725 --> 01:17:54.484
No idea.

01:17:56.404 --> 01:18:00.164
You're really letting
The Wolf Hunter go, then?

01:18:00.204 --> 01:18:02.324
You bet.

01:18:07.524 --> 01:18:12.484
Tell me, the different elements
of the myth, the mask, the eyes,

01:18:12.524 --> 01:18:16.045
being left in the woods.
Who came up with what?

01:18:18.005 --> 01:18:21.164
The werewolf thing was my dad's.

01:18:21.204 --> 01:18:25.765
The silver bullet and red eyes,
the website stuff was me.

01:18:25.805 --> 01:18:29.645
What about being left in the woods?
Whose idea was that?

01:18:30.965 --> 01:18:32.404
Can't remember now.

01:18:35.284 --> 01:18:36.885
Mel maybe.

01:19:02.845 --> 01:19:04.364
Winter?

01:19:04.404 --> 01:19:07.725
Wolf eyes on the sign
at the campsite.

01:19:09.885 --> 01:19:11.845
Did you find out
about the sale of the cottage?

01:19:11.885 --> 01:19:13.324
It was bought 18 years ago,

01:19:13.364 --> 01:19:16.005
I'm still trying to track down
who's behind the holding company.

01:19:16.045 --> 01:19:19.125
It's OK, I think I know.

01:19:19.164 --> 01:19:20.204
What's going on?

01:19:20.244 --> 01:19:24.765
I'm not sure. We'll need you
to account for all your guests.

01:19:24.805 --> 01:19:28.045
Where's your husband?
I don't know, he took a call.

01:19:32.925 --> 01:19:35.085
Mr Everett? Mrs Everett?

01:19:36.604 --> 01:19:40.805
You've been coming to the village
for 36 years, I believe.

01:19:40.845 --> 01:19:43.404
The first time you came,
you stayed at Daisy Cottage.

01:19:43.444 --> 01:19:46.164
Why do you keep coming back?
It's private.

01:19:47.805 --> 01:19:52.085
I'm sorry, but I have to ask,
do you have any children?

01:19:53.765 --> 01:19:56.965
No. No, we don't.

01:19:57.005 --> 01:19:59.564
Did you once?

01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:03.925
We had a baby.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:08.444
She was conceived at Daisy Cottage,
but we lost her,

01:20:08.484 --> 01:20:10.164
then we couldn't have any more.

01:20:11.885 --> 01:20:14.005
Lost her in what way?

01:20:14.045 --> 01:20:19.524
I said, it's private.
It is all right, Pat.

01:20:22.805 --> 01:20:25.524
We gave her up for adoption.

01:20:25.564 --> 01:20:28.045
We were young, from strict,
Catholic backgrounds.

01:20:28.085 --> 01:20:31.204
We'd only just met and didn't know
if we'd stay together.

01:20:31.244 --> 01:20:33.045
We've regretted it every day since.

01:20:33.085 --> 01:20:36.604
Did you have any way
of tracking the child down?

01:20:37.845 --> 01:20:43.284
At that time, we didn't want that,
so we didn't give our details.

01:20:43.324 --> 01:20:46.284
We just left a postcard.

01:20:46.324 --> 01:20:48.284
But you've kept coming back here.

01:20:48.324 --> 01:20:49.765
We wanted to buy the cottage,

01:20:49.805 --> 01:20:53.324
but the trail went cold
on who owned it.

01:20:54.645 --> 01:21:00.204
It's just too upsetting.

01:21:00.244 --> 01:21:01.885
And we've given up hope.

01:21:04.965 --> 01:21:07.925
Have you said
your goodbyes to people?

01:21:07.965 --> 01:21:09.965
We have.

01:21:10.005 --> 01:21:13.444
Have you given the glampsite
as the reason?

01:21:13.484 --> 01:21:14.524
Yeah.

01:21:16.564 --> 01:21:20.885
I mean, we wouldn't mention
the real reason, would we?

01:21:32.845 --> 01:21:35.965
You said your husband received
a call. Do you know who from?

01:21:36.005 --> 01:21:39.484
He just said it was a potential
investor, he's gone to meet them.

01:21:39.524 --> 01:21:44.125
He's not meeting an investor.
He's meeting The Wolf Hunter.

01:21:44.164 --> 01:21:46.965
And I think I know where.

01:22:45.125 --> 01:22:47.844
I don't understand.
Nor did I at first.

01:22:47.884 --> 01:22:50.004
I thought it was about vengeance.

01:22:51.525 --> 01:22:53.644
But it's not.

01:22:53.684 --> 01:22:58.165
I think it's about abandonment.

01:23:06.004 --> 01:23:09.285
This doesn't have to happen.

01:23:09.325 --> 01:23:11.564
You said
you weren't one for taking chances

01:23:11.604 --> 01:23:14.884
on the roulette wheel of love.
But you did, didn't you?

01:23:14.924 --> 01:23:16.724
You took a chance and you lost.

01:23:19.365 --> 01:23:23.764
Why did you create a nest?
A haven?

01:23:31.525 --> 01:23:34.285
Because I never had one.
Do you know what that's like?

01:23:34.325 --> 01:23:37.884
To be always on your own? Huh?

01:23:37.924 --> 01:23:41.445
Until I let Jez in, and Kelly.

01:23:41.485 --> 01:23:45.924
I get that the costume was easy
and that you took the boots

01:23:45.964 --> 01:23:49.045
from Eric Gladberry.
But a real gun?

01:23:49.085 --> 01:23:52.205
Yeah, because the smithy and Jez
wanted to create the real thing,

01:23:52.245 --> 01:23:54.165
but we couldn't have it
in the exhibition.

01:23:54.205 --> 01:23:56.325
What about the cane?

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:59.525
It was the first one he did,
but it broke.

01:23:59.564 --> 01:24:01.764
Jez was gonna leave,
and I couldn't have that.

01:24:01.804 --> 01:24:04.004
I can't bear to be left.

01:24:04.045 --> 01:24:06.165
We had a year.

01:24:06.205 --> 01:24:10.964
I finally let someone in
who I could trust.

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.884
Or so I thought.

01:24:12.924 --> 01:24:14.604
Why The Wolf Hunter?

01:24:14.644 --> 01:24:20.604
Because, like him,
I was left in the wilderness.

01:24:20.644 --> 01:24:21.764
Abandoned.

01:24:21.804 --> 01:24:24.125
Not just by Jez,
but by your parents.

01:24:24.165 --> 01:24:26.724
Did you look for them?
Yes, of course I did.

01:24:26.764 --> 01:24:29.844
As soon as I was 18.

01:24:29.884 --> 01:24:33.525
But the records didn't exist,
just some money and a postcard

01:24:33.564 --> 01:24:37.764
of this place, so I came here
and I secretly bought the cottage.

01:24:37.804 --> 01:24:41.004
And you know who your parents are
now, don't you?

01:24:41.045 --> 01:24:44.684
Abandoning me again.

01:24:44.724 --> 01:24:48.684
Only this time, it's his fault
that they're leaving.

01:24:48.724 --> 01:24:51.245
Why don't you see them?
Speak to them? Meet them?

01:24:51.285 --> 01:24:54.564
Because I've done wrong!

01:24:54.604 --> 01:24:57.085
I can't bear the thought
of them knowing that.

01:24:59.405 --> 01:25:02.325
Why didn't you make them stay?
No!

01:25:02.365 --> 01:25:04.724
Think, Mel. Put the pistol down.

01:25:04.764 --> 01:25:07.285
Why? Why? What's the point?

01:25:07.325 --> 01:25:11.125
It's too late, they've gone.

01:25:11.165 --> 01:25:12.924
They gave me a book on daisies.

01:25:12.964 --> 01:25:16.004
Oh, great, well,
that's how I knew it.

01:25:16.045 --> 01:25:20.644
Because the postcard I had said that
Mum loves them, and this place.

01:25:20.684 --> 01:25:24.165
So all the while,
they were here the whole time.

01:25:24.205 --> 01:25:28.724
They still are.
Yes, but I can't see them, can I?

01:25:28.764 --> 01:25:31.804
Oh, I must have been so bad
for them to leave me.

01:25:31.844 --> 01:25:35.405
I must've been,
otherwise why would they give me up?

01:25:35.445 --> 01:25:36.804
Because we were young.

01:25:38.804 --> 01:25:43.004
We cared too much
what other people would think.

01:25:43.045 --> 01:25:45.964
We didn't know any better.

01:25:46.004 --> 01:25:47.764
We let you down.
No, no, no, no.

01:25:47.804 --> 01:25:49.724
Not after what I've done, no.
It's OK.

01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:52.365
No, it's not OK!

01:25:53.884 --> 01:26:00.285
All I've ever wanted was a family,
that's all I've ever dreamed of.

01:26:00.325 --> 01:26:03.724
Why did you leave me?

01:26:03.764 --> 01:26:06.924
I was a coward.
I couldn't find you.

01:26:08.485 --> 01:26:11.085
I tried to find you.

01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:14.405
Why does everybody leave me?

01:26:14.445 --> 01:26:21.125
If you want someone to blame,
blame us. Not Mr Yarrow here.

01:26:21.165 --> 01:26:23.405
He's the one that's driven you away.

01:26:29.644 --> 01:26:31.644
He hasn't.

01:26:33.125 --> 01:26:35.245
We're not going.

01:26:38.125 --> 01:26:40.644
I don't care what you've done.

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:43.604
You're my flesh and blood.

01:26:43.644 --> 01:26:47.245
Whatever happens after this,
I will never leave you again.

01:26:48.924 --> 01:26:50.365
Nor me.

01:26:53.245 --> 01:26:55.884
Mel.

01:26:57.844 --> 01:26:59.485
My little Melanie.

01:27:21.045 --> 01:27:23.684
Thank you. Thank you.

01:27:31.445 --> 01:27:36.884
Mum. It's a little gift I made.

01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:40.525
Thank you. It's beautiful.

01:27:40.564 --> 01:27:43.604
Are you gonna be OK?
Yeah.

01:27:43.644 --> 01:27:47.004
Pat's decided to help out, Mum
and Dad have said they'll chip in.

01:27:47.045 --> 01:27:49.644
Fingers crossed. And the Everetts,
are they going to stay on?

01:27:49.684 --> 01:27:52.724
Yeah. Yeah, in the cottage.

01:27:52.764 --> 01:27:55.525
To be here for Mel.

01:27:55.564 --> 01:27:59.564
Thank you. Thanks for coming.
You're welcome.

01:27:59.604 --> 01:28:02.125
Any ideas where John got to?

01:28:02.165 --> 01:28:04.924
I can't wait for us to try
some of these treatments together.

01:28:04.964 --> 01:28:06.045
Sit.

01:28:07.405 --> 01:28:10.964
No, Paddy, sit. Stay.

01:28:12.405 --> 01:28:16.205
Ah, since you all wanted to
check out the treatments,

01:28:16.245 --> 01:28:17.884
I thought I'd see
what this was like.

01:28:17.924 --> 01:28:20.085
But I'm fine, really,
don't worry about me.

01:28:20.125 --> 01:28:23.644
Yeah, we can see that. Well,
once your muscles have relaxed,

01:28:23.684 --> 01:28:26.165
perhaps you'd like to try
the Shakti Mat.

01:28:26.205 --> 01:28:29.485
The what? What's that?
It's a bed of nails, darling.

01:28:37.764 --> 01:28:41.245
How about Garuda therapy?

01:28:41.285 --> 01:28:44.844
Where they put bloodsucking leeches
all over you.

01:28:48.085 --> 01:28:50.964
Paddy!
