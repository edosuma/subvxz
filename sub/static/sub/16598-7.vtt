WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.570
Previously on The Exorcist...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.972
It's a demon and it's trying
to take my daughter.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.040
(screams)

00:06.074 --> 00:07.575
Oh, God! Oh!

00:07.608 --> 00:10.344
MARCUS: I've noticed
the belladonna flourishes.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.012
What do you use it for?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.347
Extreme cases.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.183
Tattersal's assets
were acquired

00:15.216 --> 00:18.052
by Walters Industrial
Holdings, as in

00:18.086 --> 00:19.653
George and Maria Walters.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.688
And there's more.

00:20.721 --> 00:21.822
1.8 million

00:21.855 --> 00:23.491
to The Friars of Ascension.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.593
Those organs...

00:25.626 --> 00:27.195
they're only used
for one reason.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.430
Vocare Pulvere...

00:29.463 --> 00:31.832
the ceremony of ash.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.201
(whispering eerily):
Take me.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.902
Take me.
Take me.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.270
(choking)

00:38.272 --> 00:40.741
(panting)

00:40.774 --> 00:42.676
I moved out.
There's a place where

00:42.710 --> 00:44.112
I'm not married and
you're not a priest.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.446
Leave everything else outside.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.748
Your daughter broke
a man's jaw on the "L."

00:47.781 --> 00:49.417
It's not possible that

00:49.450 --> 00:52.620
she could have
done this, is it?

00:52.653 --> 00:53.954
What's gonna happen to her?

00:53.987 --> 00:55.356
It'll force her to submit.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.424
A union

00:56.457 --> 00:58.058
of demon and host.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.360
Two entities becoming one.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.628
Integration.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.796
Integration, it's said
to be permanent.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.367
(demonic growl)

01:06.400 --> 01:08.336
(grunting)

01:11.071 --> 01:12.273
Help me.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.909
(organ music plays)

01:44.772 --> 01:46.174
Thank you for being here.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.976
ALL:
In the name of the Father,
the Son,

01:49.009 --> 01:51.279
and the Holy Spirit.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.980
CONGREGATION: Amen.
The Lord be with you.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.715
CONGREGATION:
And also with your spirit.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.418
TOMAS:
How'd you find her?

01:57.451 --> 01:59.420
Has she been integrated?

01:59.453 --> 02:00.821
Does she look integrated?
(demonic growling)

02:00.854 --> 02:02.022
Where are we taking her?

02:02.055 --> 02:03.991
Somewhere she'll be safe.
Just drive faster.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.159
TOMAS:
I confess...

02:05.193 --> 02:06.360
CONGREGATION: I confess...

02:06.394 --> 02:07.461
to Almighty God...

02:07.495 --> 02:08.796
CONGREGATION:
...to Almighty God...

02:08.829 --> 02:11.299
ALL:
and to you,
my brothers and sisters,

02:11.332 --> 02:12.833
that I have greatly sinned...

02:12.866 --> 02:14.635
CONGREGATION: ...that I have
greatly sinned...

02:14.668 --> 02:16.036
...in my thoughts
CONGREGATION:
...in my thoughts...

02:16.069 --> 02:18.339
...and in my words...
...and in my words...

02:18.372 --> 02:19.873
...in what I have done...

02:19.907 --> 02:20.941
CONGREGATION:
...in what I have done...

02:20.974 --> 02:22.310
...and what I have failed to do.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.978
CONGREGATION:
...and what I have failed to do.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.214
Through my fault...

02:26.247 --> 02:27.748
CONGREGATION:
Through my fault...

02:29.583 --> 02:31.885
...through my most
grievous fault.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.487
I cannot be
an exorcist,

02:33.521 --> 02:34.655
but I can be
your taxi driver.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.656
That's right, yeah.

02:35.689 --> 02:36.824
Can you give us a hand?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
(demonic growling)

02:41.595 --> 02:43.664
Mother Bernadette!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.133
(demonic growling)

02:46.166 --> 02:47.368
(grunts)

02:47.401 --> 02:48.369
MARCUS:
Mother Bernadette!

02:48.402 --> 02:50.238
(demonic grunting)

02:50.271 --> 02:51.972
NUN:
Careful.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.474
All right.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.076
(demonic grunting)

02:56.109 --> 02:58.846
You belong to your father,
the Devil.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.248
There is no truth in him.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.315
He's a liar.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.750
He is the
father of lies.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.184
(demonic growling)

03:05.353 --> 03:06.554
Get her inside.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.657
MARCUS:
You can assist me again,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.525
but one lapse
of concentration...

03:11.559 --> 03:13.261
No more lectures.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.064
Come back when
I've got her ready.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.332
I'll tell the family.
No.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.867
This is not just a possession.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.101
But they have
the right to know.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.336
This is a revenge.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.771
Can you not see that?

03:23.804 --> 03:25.906
Four decades ago, it had
Regan's body and it lost it.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.276
That is a demon
with a 40-year grudge.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.711
Now, it wants to torture
her daughter in front of her.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.280
I'm not gonna give it
that satisfaction.
No.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.281
You're asking me to lie.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.782
I was this close
at the Rance house.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.350
I got it swimming laps
in the lake.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.351
God is in me.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.786
Yeah, lie.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.091
(sighs)

03:44.124 --> 03:46.727
Let us pray to the Lord

03:46.760 --> 03:48.296
for the safe return

03:48.329 --> 03:49.997
of Casey Rance.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.267
That she may soon be found

03:53.301 --> 03:57.605
and reunited
with her loving family.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.342
Lord, hear our prayers.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.779
*

04:35.709 --> 04:38.145
(reporters clamoring)

04:44.885 --> 04:46.253
Come on.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.121
REPORTER:
Ms. MacNeil, do you have an idea

04:48.155 --> 04:49.757
about Casey's whereabouts?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.124
HENRY:
Please, let me through.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.192
Let me through,
through here.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.361
Let me through.
Please, back off.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.062
Please, back off.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.208
Ms. MacNeil,
is Casey's condition

05:08.241 --> 05:09.877
related to what happened
to your daughter, Regan?

05:09.910 --> 05:12.513
The property line
is behind the gate.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.147
Is Casey's condition
related to what happened

05:14.181 --> 05:15.383
to your daughter, Regan?

05:15.416 --> 05:18.452
My daughter's name is Angela.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.321
There's nothing wrong with Casey
except she isn't here.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.624
Now, please, leave us be.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.125
REPORTER 2:
There seems to be something
in common with your family.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.527
Can you give us
something to go on?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.761
(reporters clamoring)

05:45.846 --> 05:48.816
Scooped the Sun Times, did it?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.984
If they find out
we've been hiding her...

05:51.018 --> 05:53.654
They won't.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.824
Nine days since
the girl arrived.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.559
Have you noticed
any change in her?

05:58.592 --> 06:01.328
The demon is rallying itself...

06:01.361 --> 06:02.430
'cause it knows we're winning.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.598
It's tripled in strength.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.166
What's your point?

06:06.199 --> 06:09.036
If we fail here,
we are unleashing

06:09.069 --> 06:11.505
an ancient violence
into the world.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.373
Well, let's not fail then.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.009
And if it can't complete the
integration, then it will kill

06:16.043 --> 06:18.378
the girl out of spite--
you know this.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.514
So, what are we supposed to do?
Just give it up?

06:20.548 --> 06:22.082
Sorry, God,
this one's too hard.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.717
Can you send us something
a bit easier?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.553
We stand

06:25.586 --> 06:27.354
in the doorway...

06:27.387 --> 06:29.690
and we push back the darkness.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.258
Remember?

06:35.763 --> 06:37.765
(sighs)

06:40.067 --> 06:42.069
EGAN: I've been praying
for her every day

06:42.102 --> 06:44.438
since she went missing.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.640
I've been praying for you,
as well, Tomas.

06:46.674 --> 06:49.810
What you've done here
is extraordinary.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.645
You brought the entire
community together.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.046
You did that.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.148
Don't think the Church
hasn't noticed.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.650
Thank you.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.352
Unfortunately...

07:00.420 --> 07:03.090
...with the tension,
comes scrutiny.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.925
And we both know
there's an element

07:04.958 --> 07:08.629
of Casey's situation
which is... sensitive.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.565
With all due respect...

07:11.599 --> 07:13.567
when we presented you
the evidence...

07:13.601 --> 07:15.936
I-I-I made a mistake, Tomas.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.005
I know that now.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.474
And I am sorry.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.242
But moving forward,

07:22.275 --> 07:25.679
we need to be proactive
in protecting the Church.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.515
What do you mean?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.282
Where is Marcus Keane?

07:32.219 --> 07:34.354
I haven't seen--
Stop.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.090
What would happen
if the media got word

07:37.124 --> 07:38.992
there was an
excommunicated priest

07:39.026 --> 07:41.261
conducting
unsanctioned exorcisms

07:41.294 --> 07:42.663
right under our nose,

07:42.696 --> 07:45.666
within a week
of H-His Holiness's visit?

07:45.699 --> 07:46.967
How would that reflect?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.202
You were the ones
who excommunicated him.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.140
I work for the ones
who excommunicated him.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.307
And so do you.

07:54.341 --> 07:58.646
And just or unjust,
your friend is now

07:58.679 --> 08:00.447
an enemy of the Church.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.615
That's why it is crucial

08:01.649 --> 08:02.983
that we must find him

08:03.016 --> 08:04.952
before he causes
further scandal.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.954
I will ask you again.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.155
Have you seen him?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.058
No.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.136
(indistinct chatter)

08:23.170 --> 08:24.137
ANGELA: This is the
last one, right?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.172
Mm-hmm.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.540
What-what is it?

08:26.574 --> 08:27.975
Investigative Hour.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.309
It's national,

08:29.342 --> 08:30.477
in case she crossed
state lines.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.679
Mm-hmm.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.713
Katherine,

08:32.746 --> 08:35.115
this seat on the end
is for you.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.719
Mrs. Rance,
if you could sit

08:38.752 --> 08:40.187
next to your mother.
Thank you.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.489
Sit here.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.024
Mr. Rance.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.058
WOMAN:
I hope this helps.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.226
WOMAN 2:
It will, but...

08:46.259 --> 08:48.161
PRODUCER: Yeah.
WOMAN 2: Okay, yeah, thanks.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.097
Okay, here we go.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.599
(clears throat)

08:51.632 --> 08:54.067
I'd like to start
with you, Chris.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.003
Fine.
Yeah.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.606
This certainly
isn't your family's

08:58.639 --> 09:01.541
first brush with tragedy.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.344
Well, today, fortunately,
we're not talking

09:04.377 --> 09:06.213
about the past.
Mm.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.849
Which, I believe,
was made abundantly clear.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.252
So, your granddaughter's
disappearance is...

09:12.285 --> 09:14.554
unrelated to what happened
in Georgetown?

09:14.588 --> 09:18.125
As I said,
we're discussing Casey.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.028
Then let's talk
about Casey.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.029
Perfect.
Mm-hmm.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.464
Okay.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.434
Is your daughter
dangerous?

09:27.467 --> 09:28.902
What?

09:28.936 --> 09:31.371
She wandered
away from a crash

09:31.404 --> 09:32.806
that left two
medical workers dead.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.041
HENRY:
That wasn't her fault.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.776
Casey was sedated.
She was strapped

09:35.809 --> 09:38.411
to a gurney.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.479
INTERVIEWER:
Okay, what about the rumors

09:39.512 --> 09:41.715
that she was involved

09:41.749 --> 09:43.651
in some kind of altercation
on the "L" train?

09:43.684 --> 09:46.053
KAT: Yeah, that magazine also
says that Bat Boy had a wedding

09:46.086 --> 09:47.554
in Las Vegas-- are we
really talking about this?

09:47.587 --> 09:51.558
We have a police report
that says that she was

09:51.591 --> 09:53.994
placed under a 5150
psychiatric hold.

09:54.027 --> 09:54.995
Can you tell us why?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.697
Done.
We're done.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.466
This is not what we agreed upon.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.901
I'm sorry.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.303
I'm sorry, really.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.472
Okay. Okay.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.008
But if I could just
ask you one more question.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.643
It's not a kidnapping,

10:09.677 --> 10:11.144
and she's out
there somewhere,

10:11.178 --> 10:13.446
why wouldn't she
just come home?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.983
(people chanting)

10:16.016 --> 10:16.984
MARCUS:
...spiritual vessel.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.485
Vessel of Honor.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.353
Singular vessel of devotion.
(glass shatters)

10:20.387 --> 10:21.989
Mystical Rose.
(demonic growling)

10:22.022 --> 10:23.490
Tower of David,
Tower of Ivory.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.759
House of Gold,
the Ark of the Covenant,

10:25.793 --> 10:26.994
(nuns chanting)
Jacob from Heaven...

10:27.027 --> 10:28.662
Make this stop.
Health of the Sick...

10:28.696 --> 10:31.264
(nuns chanting)
(wind whooshing)

10:31.298 --> 10:34.001
Holy Mother of God,
pray for us.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.003
Holy Virgin of Virgins,
pray for us.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.005
You have no authority
but that which is given.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
(nuns chanting)

10:41.508 --> 10:43.176
NUNS:
You are forgiven.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.644
(overlapping prayers
and chanting)

10:44.678 --> 10:47.681
NUNS: Ashes on the Earth,
you are relieved.

10:47.715 --> 10:48.982
MARCUS: I pray for you.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.350
NUNS: Outcast.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.885
NUNS:
Fallen angel.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.453
You are loved.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.823
MARCUS: Mother of our Creator...

10:55.856 --> 10:56.957
(demonic growl)

10:56.990 --> 10:59.459
Virgin most prudent...

10:59.492 --> 11:02.863
(praying quickly,
indistinctly)

11:02.896 --> 11:04.865
MARCUS: No will but that
which is given.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.800
You have no authority
but that which is given.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.370
(cries out, groaning)

11:12.072 --> 11:13.807
You have no power
but that which is given.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.376
You have no will but
that which is given.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.546
(demonic growl)

11:19.579 --> 11:22.750
Holy virgin of virgins,
pray for us.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.319
Mother of
divine grace...

11:26.353 --> 11:27.587
(demonic growling)

11:27.620 --> 11:29.422
Mother most
chaste...

11:39.532 --> 11:42.202
You're gonna need more
than cactus for that.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.377
Is it always like this?

11:50.410 --> 11:53.613
All we can do is bait the hook
and put it in the water.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.549
Sometimes it's a minnow
that comes along...

11:56.583 --> 11:59.019
(sighs)

11:59.052 --> 12:01.088
sometimes it's a big
bloody shark.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.024
What happened to you
out in the lake?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.793
You're different.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.932
I killed her.

12:11.965 --> 12:15.735
I almost... killed her.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.973
She stopped fighting
and she stopped breathing.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.042
Uh, my madness...

12:22.075 --> 12:25.612
just, it had me.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.885
And then...

12:31.919 --> 12:35.055
God...

12:35.088 --> 12:38.225
He just, He woke up
from His nap,

12:38.258 --> 12:41.561
and He just,
He ripped through my hands,

12:41.594 --> 12:43.596
and He brought her back.

12:45.032 --> 12:48.101
She's my ward now.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.272
You felt God...

12:52.305 --> 12:54.942
in your hands?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.246
It could have been hypothermia.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.917
God saves Casey,

13:03.951 --> 13:05.452
but also saves the demon?

13:05.485 --> 13:07.320
Don't-don't, Tomas.
Don't go there.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.956
Why?

13:10.657 --> 13:13.293
God is not...
is not some big,

13:13.326 --> 13:14.928
fluffy border collie
that comes running

13:14.962 --> 13:16.296
every time you snap
your fingers.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.664
He does what
He damn well pleases.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.369
It's not our job
to understand why.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.473
(crowd clamoring nearby)

13:36.483 --> 13:38.485
(shouting indistinctly)

13:43.857 --> 13:45.525
Come on, let us through.
Come on!

13:49.829 --> 13:51.164
Mrs. Rance, how do you
respond to claims

13:51.198 --> 13:52.799
that Casey attacked someone...

13:52.832 --> 13:55.035
Come on! Come on!
We're just trying
to find our daughter.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.070
Come on, let us through.
Come on!

13:57.104 --> 13:59.672
Mrs. Rance, Mrs. Rance,

13:59.706 --> 14:02.009
do you recognize him?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.311
No...
His name was James Harris.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.213
Six years as
a first responder.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.182
He died driving your
daughter to the hospital.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.084
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?

14:11.118 --> 14:13.921
That my boy's never
gonna see his father?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.188
Are you sorry for that?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.891
No, no, no, I-I tried
to stop them, I did. I-I...

14:17.925 --> 14:20.160
No car crash did that
to my James.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.095
Come on, come on.
I don't want your sorries.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.264
Your little demon
girl killed him!

14:24.297 --> 14:25.532
Okay, come on, come on!

14:25.565 --> 14:26.766
Come on, get out
of the way!

14:26.799 --> 14:28.101
Come on. Come on!

14:28.135 --> 14:29.136
Get out of the way!

14:31.471 --> 14:33.873
(crowd clamoring)

14:40.713 --> 14:43.683
We scheduled the first stop
at this corner here.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.752
His Holiness can
get out of the car,

14:45.785 --> 14:46.954
take a few minutes
with the crowd...

14:46.987 --> 14:49.722
Bless a few
strategically placed babies.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.890
(laughter)

14:50.924 --> 14:54.427
How many undercover assets
do you have on the route?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.896
How many uniformed
police officers?

14:56.930 --> 14:59.199
Do you have access
to the rooftops?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.467
Have you checked
the windows?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.734
Where's the intelligence
officer?

15:01.768 --> 15:03.436
Why am I talking
to this guy?

15:03.470 --> 15:04.804
Father Bennett, I don't
tell you how to say mass.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.739
Don't tell me
how to do my job.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.109
That location is untenable.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.378
There are sight lines from
a dozen different buildings.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.480
His Holiness would be
totally exposed.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.616
Which is precisely why
the stops are spontaneous.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.452
Father Bennett, the only
people who even know

15:19.486 --> 15:22.289
this is happening are standing
around this conference table.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.091
We should stick
to the original plan.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.225
Proceed directly
to the stadium.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.560
No stops.
I have the utmost faith

15:27.594 --> 15:28.728
in Superintendent Jaffey's
ability.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.964
Father Bennett,
calm down.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.732
We go through this every time
Obama comes to town.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.635
I had a lovely chat
this morning with the head

15:35.668 --> 15:37.004
of the Swiss Guard.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.405
Ran him through
all the changes.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.674
I'm sorry,
Brother Simon, was it?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.943
I still don't understand exactly
what you're doing here.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.749
Simon heads up fundraising
for our committee.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.952
The money he's raised so far has
gone a long way to making this

15:52.986 --> 15:54.854
entire trip possible.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.757
About that, I took the liberty

15:57.790 --> 16:00.527
of requesting copies
of the committee's accounts.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.628
Do you know what I found?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.430
I can't imagine.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.498
Tattersal Landscaping.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.368
$2.7 million
in charitable giving

16:08.401 --> 16:10.437
to this campaign alone.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.273
By far, the committee's
single biggest donor.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.308
As I'm sure you're aware,
Mrs. Walters,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.477
seeing as your husband
served on the Tattersal

16:17.510 --> 16:20.280
board of directors
for nine years.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.649
If George felt it
his Catholic duty

16:22.682 --> 16:25.618
to give of our
good fortune, so be it.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.121
And we are certainly
very grateful to your husband

16:28.155 --> 16:29.889
for his generosity, Maria.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.392
Tattersal filed
for bankruptcy in 2012.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.461
Its assets were dissolved.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.063
So perhaps you'd like
to explain to me

16:36.096 --> 16:38.298
how a defunct
landscaping company

16:38.331 --> 16:41.668
funnels nearly $3 million
into a papal planning committee

16:41.701 --> 16:44.337
four years after
going out of business?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.505
Seeing as it's your job.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.508
I'll tell you what.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.143
Why don't I do some digging

16:50.177 --> 16:52.212
and get back to you on that?
Would you like a shovel?

16:52.245 --> 16:55.715
Only if you bring it,
Father Bennett.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.818
BISHOP EGAN: Perhaps we could
turn our attention

16:58.851 --> 17:02.055
to the matters at hand?

17:05.058 --> 17:06.826
Here you go, Father.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.428
Thank you, Ms. MacNeil.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.563
Please, Father,
call me Chris.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.232
Chris.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.767
Uh...

17:14.801 --> 17:17.036
what was it like?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.706
Georgetown?

17:21.208 --> 17:23.176
Have you ever been walking
down a flight of stairs

17:23.210 --> 17:26.346
late at night,
and you miscount,

17:26.379 --> 17:27.747
and there's one
extra step

17:27.780 --> 17:29.716
that you'd forgotten,

17:29.749 --> 17:32.018
and suddenly
you're in free fall?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.854
For months on end,
just falling

17:34.887 --> 17:38.758
and falling, until you
hit the ground.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.731
We weren't alone, though.
We had priests.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.134
Good men.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.802
Gave their lives
to save us.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.241
Actually, Father,
you remind me very much

17:54.274 --> 17:56.075
of one of them.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.514
(indistinct shouting)

18:05.752 --> 18:07.554
Thanks for coming, Father.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.622
Of course.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.491
I've kept you, always,
in my prayers.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.893
Have you talked
to Father Marcus?

18:13.926 --> 18:17.230
No. No, not for
a long time.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.931
He said he would
find her.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.934
And he will, but
we need to be patient.

18:21.968 --> 18:25.172
Two weeks ago he said it was
only a matter of hours

18:25.205 --> 18:28.575
until the demon took control
of Casey permanently.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.410
What did you call it?
Integration.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.644
Is that what's
happened?

18:31.678 --> 18:34.080
Every case is different.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.684
Right. How many cases
have you had?

18:37.717 --> 18:39.686
Be patient, he says.
Two weeks.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.454
Angie, come on.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.793
Do you think she's alive?

18:48.295 --> 18:49.362
Yes.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.763
How do you know?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.532
How do you
know?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.834
I have faith.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.870
Well, the next time
you talk to God,

18:57.904 --> 18:59.272
ask Him how He can
just sit back

18:59.306 --> 19:01.441
and let something
like this happen.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.643
Then you tell me
what He said.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.312
Ange, he's trying to help.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.681
Maybe you should try harder.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.031
(raspy breathing)

19:39.178 --> 19:40.880
TOMAS:
When did this happen?

19:40.913 --> 19:43.015
MARCUS:
This morning.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.151
What does it mean?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.153
It means the body
has failed.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.755
Is failing.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.093
What about the demon?

19:54.126 --> 19:57.096
He was quiet
all morning,

19:57.129 --> 19:59.266
hiding inside her.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.401
Attacking her
from within.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.771
If the demon can't
be drawn out,

20:04.804 --> 20:08.541
we can't finish
the exorcism.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.842
And so...

20:09.876 --> 20:12.211
(Casey groaning weakly)

20:16.649 --> 20:18.985
...she dies.

20:24.824 --> 20:28.428
(breathing unsteadily)

20:33.766 --> 20:36.168
MARCUS:
Why is Casey sedated?

20:42.309 --> 20:43.476
There, 4:00.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.245
Why is she sedated?

20:50.417 --> 20:52.385
I ordered the sisters
to give her a tincture

20:52.419 --> 20:54.086
of Passionflower.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.388
If I can't wake her up,

20:55.422 --> 20:57.424
then I can't exorcise her.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.225
I'm afraid our
professional opinions

20:59.258 --> 21:00.493
have parted ways.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.362
What are you saying?

21:03.963 --> 21:04.931
No.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.933
Tea made from the leaves
will bring about

21:06.966 --> 21:08.134
a swift and painless end.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.469
No!

21:09.502 --> 21:11.638
Why do you think God allows
His children to suffer?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.406
Wh--?! I don't know.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.575
So university freshmen have got
something to argue about

21:15.608 --> 21:16.976
in their dormitories!

21:17.009 --> 21:19.579
Sometimes, suffering
is just suffering.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.013
It serves no higher purpose.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.148
It simply is.

21:22.181 --> 21:26.653
God is not the source
of Casey's suffering.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.855
Needlessly torturing
a young woman

21:28.888 --> 21:31.991
whose body is rotting
before our eyes,

21:32.024 --> 21:35.862
who has zero hope of recovery,
that is not compassion.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.497
What, and killing her is?!

21:37.530 --> 21:40.333
Why do you think we
grow the belladonna?

21:40.367 --> 21:42.602
Do you think we simply
release the integrated

21:42.635 --> 21:45.605
back into the world
like mad puppets?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.374
Spare her now.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.875
We spare her soul.

21:48.908 --> 21:52.144
Continue this, and
the demon will take her.

21:52.178 --> 21:54.681
But you know this.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.016
We'll tend to her wounds,

21:57.049 --> 22:01.287
but the sisters and I will take
no further part in the exorcism.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.022
At some point,

22:03.055 --> 22:05.224
you have to ask yourself
whether you're continuing this

22:05.257 --> 22:08.361
for Casey's sake
or your own.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.196
(church bell tolling)

22:18.905 --> 22:20.707
CHRIS:
Cocktail hour is at 1:00

22:20.740 --> 22:23.109
in the California desert.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.493
CHRIS:
Is this fake Mom?

22:40.527 --> 22:42.395
Uh...

22:42.429 --> 22:44.263
I found those at a...
at a thrift store,

22:44.296 --> 22:46.399
sitting in a shoe box.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.402
I figured she looked
enough like me.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.404
It's a terrible robe.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.572
(chuckles)

22:55.908 --> 22:57.276
Is that...

22:57.309 --> 22:59.679
Kat. Kat.
Kat.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.347
She's gorgeous.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.348
Two weeks late,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.617
17 hours of induced labor.

23:06.586 --> 23:10.857
But the first time
I saw her, uh...

23:10.890 --> 23:14.260
(exhales) something just
clicked into place.

23:14.293 --> 23:19.398
As if all the horrible things
that had happened to me

23:19.432 --> 23:22.669
were... worth it.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.442
Well, I think
she's a lucky kid.

23:32.278 --> 23:35.214
I know you're
a wonderful mom.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.248
Better than me.

23:36.282 --> 23:39.919
Hmm. Oh, I don't know.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.921
How many kids can say
they spent Christmas Eve

23:41.954 --> 23:44.090
at the Beverly Hills Hotel,

23:44.123 --> 23:47.894
singing "Jingle Bells"
on Steve McQueen's lap?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.662
That's true.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.333
You want to hear
something crazy?

23:54.366 --> 23:58.070
I used to, uh, think
that-that you got off easy,

23:58.104 --> 24:02.108
that I had to live it
and you just had to watch.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.976
But...

24:04.010 --> 24:08.581
now, uh, now...

24:08.615 --> 24:10.016
I don't know.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.586
Uh, seems like it's...

24:13.620 --> 24:16.255
almost as bad,
the watching and waiting.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.290
'Cause you see her pain.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.132
And there's not a hell
of a thing you can do

24:26.165 --> 24:27.667
to take it from her.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.036
I used to think
I'd give up anything

24:30.069 --> 24:32.071
if you'd stop hurting
my little girl.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.877
Well, you did
the best you could.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.818
What happened in that room...

24:48.921 --> 24:54.661
I can't... I can't remember.

24:54.694 --> 24:59.398
But I did feel so dirty,

24:59.431 --> 25:02.735
so... dirty, like I would never
be clean again.

25:02.769 --> 25:06.005
And every time
I looked in your eyes,

25:06.038 --> 25:10.042
that look like I was
this broken thing.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.149
When Casey comes home,

25:17.183 --> 25:20.052
she's gonna look at me
and I'm... I'm gonna say,

25:20.086 --> 25:22.188
"You are good,

25:22.221 --> 25:26.693
and you are clean,
and none of this is your fault."

25:26.726 --> 25:31.864
I'm gonna say it
over and over and over

25:31.898 --> 25:35.367
until she believes me.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.469
(Chris exhales)

25:40.539 --> 25:42.575
You do that.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.611
Okay.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.287
Okay.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.896
I'll speak with
Mother Bernadette,

26:03.930 --> 26:05.531
convince her to
change her mind.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.967
Because nuns are so well-known
for their flexible thinking.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.568
What if I find
her a doctor?

26:09.602 --> 26:11.137
Any doctor on Earth
would take one look at her

26:11.170 --> 26:12.905
and demand she be taken
to a hospital immediately.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.708
But maybe we should take
her back to the hospital.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.277
We've got work to do.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.312
(quiet wheezing breaths)

26:22.281 --> 26:25.584
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.690
(exhales)

26:40.266 --> 26:45.237
I'm speaking now to the entity
inside this servant of the Lord.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.939
(quiet wheezing breaths
continue)

26:48.808 --> 26:51.143
And the date and hour
of your departure.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.411
We have to tell
her family.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.847
No.

26:54.881 --> 26:58.417
Star of the morning,
fallen angel, you are forgiven.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.387
You are loved.

27:05.557 --> 27:09.261
They have the right
to say good-bye.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.930
Nobody is saying good-bye,

27:10.963 --> 27:12.865
'cause she's not gonna die.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.967
(Casey gasps, whimpers)

27:15.001 --> 27:18.104
Marcus.
What?

27:18.137 --> 27:20.339
Do demons cry?

27:22.174 --> 27:23.843
(softly):
No more.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.712
No...

27:28.314 --> 27:30.549
(whispers):
No more.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.057
(siren wailing in distance)

27:45.331 --> 27:47.333
(light buzzing, door creaks)

28:14.593 --> 28:16.595
(light buzzing)

28:28.274 --> 28:30.276
(coughs)

28:38.785 --> 28:40.787
(pipe clatters on floor)

28:51.663 --> 28:53.665
(quiet whooshing)

29:09.581 --> 29:11.583
Jesus.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.031
(light buzzing)

29:30.436 --> 29:32.438
(flies buzzing)

29:37.709 --> 29:39.611
(door creaks)

29:39.645 --> 29:42.148
(coughs)

29:45.617 --> 29:47.286
(grunting)

29:54.160 --> 29:55.394
(pipe clatters,
demonic growling)

29:57.363 --> 29:58.497
(demonic grunting)

29:58.530 --> 30:01.533
(wrench clatters on floor)

30:01.567 --> 30:03.135
(blows landing)

30:03.169 --> 30:05.704
(grunting continues)

30:08.007 --> 30:09.475
(neck cracks)

30:09.508 --> 30:10.576
(body thuds)

30:12.678 --> 30:13.846
(groaning)

30:13.880 --> 30:14.713
(knife slices, Bennett yells)

30:14.746 --> 30:17.249
(demonic growling)

30:18.650 --> 30:21.353
(metallic thud,
Bennett groaning)

30:25.491 --> 30:28.827
(metal clatters on floor,
knife piercing)

30:28.861 --> 30:30.897
(demonic growling)

30:30.930 --> 30:33.499
(body thuds)

30:33.532 --> 30:36.735
(demonic growling)

30:38.270 --> 30:40.973
You're not going anywhere.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.408
(panting)

30:42.441 --> 30:44.210
Dómine,

30:44.243 --> 30:48.147
exáudi oratiónem meam.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.583
(demonic voice):
Your Pope is a pig.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.186
May the Lord pardon thee

30:54.220 --> 30:57.356
whatever sins or faults...
And pigs will be bled.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.490
...thou hast committed.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.359
You stole this body.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.028
Now you're going to die.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.729
(demonic shrieking)

31:03.762 --> 31:06.899
In the name of the Father,
the Son

31:06.933 --> 31:08.734
and the Holy Ghost!

31:08.767 --> 31:11.203
(yelling)

31:32.324 --> 31:35.327
You gonna tell me what
actually happened to your hand?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.565
I told you it was a dog.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.400
A dog.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.770
You know what
I keep thinking about?

31:44.803 --> 31:48.774
That habitat trip we took
your last year at Loyola.

31:48.807 --> 31:49.942
North Dakota.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.544
North Dakota.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.081
Every morning, I'd take
my coffee out on the porch.

31:55.114 --> 31:58.317
And you'd already be
out on the roof.

31:58.350 --> 32:02.054
Shirtless, hammer,
no safety line.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.724
But by the time I realized
I was falling in love,

32:05.757 --> 32:07.493
God, it was way too late.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.962
You never told me
about that.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.235
You had seminary.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.337
I had the rest of my life.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.805
Mm-hmm.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.908
But I used to think,
if we could just stay...

32:22.941 --> 32:24.943
(exhales)
...right here.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.648
If time could just...

32:29.681 --> 32:31.683
stop.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.922
I am still here.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.957
No. You're not.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.629
I know there's something wrong.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.499
Maybe it's this...

32:47.533 --> 32:50.669
this arrangement-- I don't know.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.039
(sighs)

32:53.072 --> 32:56.508
But I can see it...
in your eyes.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.078
(scoffs softly)

33:01.813 --> 33:03.815
I keep waiting for a sign.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.188
That I am doing the right thing.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.824
And there is nothing.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.395
Then let me help you.
No.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.498
No. You can't.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.567
Even priests need confession.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.975
I thought that, in this room,
I was just a man

33:30.008 --> 33:32.010
and you were just a woman.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.046
Wasn't that the idea?

33:37.949 --> 33:39.218
What happened
to your hand, Tomas?

33:39.251 --> 33:41.687
I have to go.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.190
(door opens)

33:44.223 --> 33:46.225
(quiet wheezing breaths)

33:49.728 --> 33:51.663
Casey, it's Father Marcus.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.165
I need you to hold on.

33:53.199 --> 33:56.368
Can you do that for me?
I need you to keep fighting.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.043
(sirens wailing in distance)

34:09.815 --> 34:10.949
CLERK:
Help you, Father?

34:10.982 --> 34:12.618
Yes. Yes, you can. I...

34:12.651 --> 34:14.720
I need something for this.

34:15.621 --> 34:16.622
(hisses)
Ooh!

34:16.655 --> 34:18.957
Whoa. That's not good.

34:18.990 --> 34:20.292
What do I need?

34:20.326 --> 34:21.760
Some serious antibiotics.
You got a prescription?

34:21.793 --> 34:24.696
Hey, I know you.
You're that priest I saw on TV!

34:24.730 --> 34:26.398
Can you write one
in an emergency?

34:26.432 --> 34:28.267
This coat's just for show.
I'm a clerk, man.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.735
No. That's okay, I...

34:29.768 --> 34:31.036
What... what...
I...

34:31.069 --> 34:33.139
Uh, sor... I saw you talk about
that girl gone missing?

34:33.172 --> 34:34.540
Yes. Hi. Hi.
Hi!

34:34.573 --> 34:35.741
Hi.
Hi. Yes.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.443
Uh, okay, something
that you can recommend?

34:37.476 --> 34:39.077
Anything.
I-I'm a clerk.

34:39.111 --> 34:41.147
Okay, if your name
was on one of these bags,

34:41.180 --> 34:42.548
then maybe I could
do something...

34:42.581 --> 34:44.216
Let me get a selfie real quick
before you...
No.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.484
(camera clicking)
Hey. It's for Donna.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.519
She calls you "the hot priest."
(chuckles)

34:48.754 --> 34:50.656
I said no.
I just wanted a photo.

34:50.689 --> 34:51.790
I said no.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.027
I just wanted a...
I just wanted a picture!

34:59.198 --> 35:00.999
(clattering, grunting)

35:01.032 --> 35:02.568
Thank you so much.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.035
(sirens wailing in distance)

35:12.478 --> 35:14.012
Good news.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.447
Your friend in the trucker hat

35:15.481 --> 35:17.082
has declined
to press charges.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.017
Says his mother
would never forgive him

35:19.050 --> 35:21.653
for sending a priest to court.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.255
(chuckles)

35:23.289 --> 35:25.491
Please tell me you were drunk.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.527
I was just...

35:29.961 --> 35:31.963
...stupid.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.537
(sighs) I didn't know
who else to call.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.006
Lucky for you,
I'm a light sleeper.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.977
Have you ever been
in a situation where...

35:47.979 --> 35:51.517
...the only way to do
the right thing is...

35:51.550 --> 35:54.186
do something wrong?

35:55.521 --> 35:57.489
Yes.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.630
One little lie.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.233
Just for the greater good.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.501
God won't mind.

36:11.737 --> 36:16.141
That's what you start to tell
yourself, inside your head.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.143
And then it multiplies.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.178
You lie...

36:22.681 --> 36:25.183
...to protect your own lies.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.255
(chuckles softly)

36:29.288 --> 36:32.524
Everybody keeps saying
that I am this...

36:34.460 --> 36:36.562
...rising star.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.600
(laughs)

36:41.633 --> 36:44.069
Rising star.

36:44.102 --> 36:45.737
Yeah, right.

36:45.771 --> 36:46.805
(chuckles)

36:48.707 --> 36:50.642
They don't know the truth.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.712
What truth is that?

37:00.218 --> 37:02.554
That I am losing myself.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.393
(quiet wheezing breaths)

37:11.430 --> 37:12.764
Dear God.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.936
Is this one of
your unfathomable plans...

37:19.438 --> 37:22.441
...that we can't question
or understand?

37:35.521 --> 37:37.489
*

37:47.599 --> 37:50.602
(door creaks)

37:58.143 --> 38:00.145
(quiet wheezing breaths
continue)

38:07.018 --> 38:08.186
TOMAS:
Katherine.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.588
Thank you. Come in.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.089
Uh, where... where is she?
(door closes)

38:11.122 --> 38:14.693
She's upstairs
with my dad and her mom.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.928
Um, you haven't...

38:16.962 --> 38:19.097
heard anything new
from the police, have you?

38:19.130 --> 38:21.800
Um... no.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.502
She's not doing well.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.637
She's asking about you.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.606
ANGELA:
(exhales) I need...

38:27.639 --> 38:29.207
HENRY:
What do you need, Ange?

38:29.240 --> 38:30.308
ANGELA:
I need, uh...

38:30.342 --> 38:31.977
HENRY:
Ange, look who it is.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.312
Look who's here.
I...

38:34.346 --> 38:36.314
TOMAS (whispers):
Hi, Angela.
Hi.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.149
Hi. How good to see you.

38:38.183 --> 38:41.119
Uh...
She's been asking for you.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.355
I came to your...

38:43.389 --> 38:46.157
I... I came to your office.

38:46.191 --> 38:48.527
And I thought it was Kat.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.063
And, uh... and the raven
crashed through...

38:52.097 --> 38:53.665
crashed through the...

38:53.699 --> 38:55.233
through the window.
Right.

38:55.266 --> 38:57.068
I remember that.
Yeah.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.170
ANGELA: And, uh...
(sniffles)

38:59.204 --> 39:00.806
Don't cry, Kat.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.541
I love you, Mom.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.576
(panting)

39:06.445 --> 39:08.880
It wasn't you, it was...
it was Casey.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.482
It was Casey.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.817
You were there
for the...

39:11.850 --> 39:13.919
and you... I, uh...

39:13.952 --> 39:16.555
I thought you should know.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.691
I thought you should know
because you cared so much.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.359
About what, Angela?

39:21.393 --> 39:23.695
(panting)

39:23.729 --> 39:25.163
What... what...

39:25.196 --> 39:26.598
Wait. Aw.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.769
When, uh...

39:30.802 --> 39:33.839
when Casey... when Casey ran.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.741
When Casey ran away?
Yeah.

39:35.774 --> 39:38.677
When she ran,
I knew.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.713
I knew that... she was okay,

39:41.747 --> 39:43.849
because I could feel...

39:43.882 --> 39:47.553
I could feel, and right here,
I could feel.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.756
And sometimes it was...
it was very strong,

39:50.789 --> 39:55.026
and sometimes...
it was just a little, uh...

39:55.060 --> 39:57.563
a flutter, a flutter.

39:57.596 --> 40:00.198
But, uh...
Oh... But...

40:00.231 --> 40:01.967
Um...
(sniffles)

40:02.000 --> 40:05.437
But today... uh,
uh, today...

40:06.938 --> 40:08.740
...it's nothing.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.275
It's nothing.

40:10.308 --> 40:13.411
Now, uh, it's e-empty.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.581
And, uh...

40:15.614 --> 40:19.417
part of me... is gone.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.720
And...

40:21.753 --> 40:24.422
and she... she's gone.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.493
She's gone.

40:27.526 --> 40:30.662
(quiet wheezing breaths)

40:30.696 --> 40:32.030
(praying quietly)

40:36.367 --> 40:38.637
(quiet wheezing breaths
continue)

40:59.958 --> 41:01.459
This is wrong.

41:01.493 --> 41:05.531
This is mercy.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.099
Look at her.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.635
Listen to her.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.670
He has my hands.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.907
This is His design.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.477
I'll not interfere.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.046
How?

41:21.079 --> 41:24.482
How can you
possibly know that?

41:29.154 --> 41:30.889
How can you not?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.624
(door opens)

41:32.658 --> 41:34.560
(high heel footsteps
approaching)

41:34.593 --> 41:37.763
(wheezing gasp)

41:42.167 --> 41:44.169
(exhales)

41:45.871 --> 41:47.939
(demonic growl)

41:51.042 --> 41:53.211
The sow.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.680
Casey.
