00:06.476 --> 00:08.639
I felt as if something
was calling me home.

00:08.695 --> 00:10.260
Everything we've been
trough with Jor-El...

00:10.280 --> 00:12.121
I just wanted to close
that chapter in my life.

00:12.143 --> 00:14.598
There is a darkness in me
that I can't always control.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.788
Well, you've certainly
seen me at my worst.

00:16.856 --> 00:18.092
And at your best.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.697
<i>Three relics...</i>

00:19.887 --> 00:21.237
<i>hidden around the world...</i>

ancient cultures...

00:23.794 --> 00:25.466
water... and that one
there means fire...

00:25.475 --> 00:27.383
and the one up
there that air.

00:27.601 --> 00:28.830
Put them together...

00:28.873 --> 00:30.039
Where is it?

00:30.040 --> 00:31.170
God help me.

00:38.399 --> 00:39.899
By now you'd
know that Lana...

00:39.900 --> 00:41.444
is nothing more than
my mothers pawn.

00:41.521 --> 00:42.821
Martha, Clark still
feels responsible...

00:42.822 --> 00:44.155
for my heart problems.

00:44.156 --> 00:45.810
If you'd found
out something...

00:46.725 --> 00:48.480
Something someone
didn't want you...

00:48.490 --> 00:49.330
to know about them...

00:49.341 --> 00:50.671
Would you tell them?

00:50.723 --> 00:51.903
What did I do?

00:51.915 --> 00:53.190
You trusted me.

00:53.266 --> 00:55.011
I can't let you
walk out, not again...

00:55.383 --> 00:57.135
<i>That's why this
time it'll be different.</i>

00:57.236 --> 00:57.957
<i>This time?</i>

00:58.252 --> 01:00.000
You are an amazing
young man, Clark,

01:00.114 --> 01:02.471
you make life and death
decisions every day.

01:02.559 --> 01:03.684
Trust your gut!

01:03.725 --> 01:06.370
<i>Greed will drive others
to hunt the Stones...</i>

01:06.375 --> 01:08.269
<i>and will drive the

01:08.309 --> 01:11.254
<i>war and the earth's
ultimate destruction.</i>

01:11.355 --> 01:13.625
Where is the stone?

01:14.041 --> 01:15.146
I gave it to Lana.

01:15.159 --> 01:17.704
<i>For she is the chosen one
and we all know that.</i>

01:18.910 --> 01:20.793
Clark's more connected
to this than any of us.

01:20.794 --> 01:22.814
It's Clark, he's...

01:23.015 --> 01:25.017
A man can't deny
his true nature.

01:26.050 --> 01:28.097
It is time to fulfill my destiny.

01:28.193 --> 01:30.438
I am the villain of the story.

01:46.165 --> 01:48.449
I have to applaud
you, Lana.

01:49.871 --> 01:52.041
I raised my son...

01:52.385 --> 01:53.585
to have a willpower...

01:53.636 --> 01:55.838
that couldn't be
broken by anything.

01:56.901 --> 02:00.401
Except his love
for you, apparently.

02:05.053 --> 02:07.087
What do you want from me?

02:07.088 --> 02:08.359
The stone.

02:09.345 --> 02:10.684
That one Lionel gave you.

02:11.127 --> 02:12.672
Lionel?

02:12.950 --> 02:14.598
He never gave me the...

02:14.659 --> 02:16.410
I'm gonna find it whether
you help or not.

05:42.291 --> 05:42.864
Clark!

05:42.868 --> 05:44.440
It's okay, it's just
a bad dream.

05:44.441 --> 05:46.471
You scared the daylights
out of us yelling like that.

05:46.475 --> 05:47.102
What?

05:47.131 --> 05:49.517
You kept yelling
"It's coming!" over and over.

Original Airdate May 18, 2005

07:11.037 --> 07:13.507
She was coming at me,
it happened so quickly.

07:13.508 --> 07:15.562
I don't even
remember stabbing her.

07:15.795 --> 07:19.959
Lana, I want you to take a
deep breath and try to relax.

07:20.950 --> 07:23.178
Lex, a woman is
dead because of me.

07:23.197 --> 07:25.145
I killed her.
No, no!

07:25.146 --> 07:26.801
You had no choice.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.848
You did what anyone would
do if their life was at stake.

07:32.648 --> 07:33.979
I have to tell Jason.

07:34.984 --> 07:36.261
She was his mother.

07:36.262 --> 07:37.573
I'll deal with Jason.

07:37.574 --> 07:39.309
Lex, there's a body
in my apartment.

07:39.310 --> 07:40.310
I have to go the police.

07:40.311 --> 07:41.415
I have to tell them
what happened.

07:41.416 --> 07:43.676
Lana, I'm not sure
that's such a wise idea.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.104
Genevieve Teague
was a powerful woman,

07:48.316 --> 07:50.067
married to an extremely
powerful lawyer.

07:50.191 --> 07:52.203
Even though it's
clearly self defense...

07:52.219 --> 07:53.658
Edward Teague is
gonna make sure...

07:53.659 --> 07:55.360
the jury sees otherwise.

07:55.361 --> 07:56.720
What's gonna happen to me?

07:57.525 --> 07:59.246
I'm gonna go to prison.

08:00.328 --> 08:01.329
No.

08:02.617 --> 08:05.012
I'll hire one of the best
defense attorneys...

08:05.013 --> 08:06.492
in the country.

08:06.493 --> 08:07.840
And once he arrives
from New York,

08:07.841 --> 08:09.880
we'll go to
the authorities.

08:09.881 --> 08:11.084
Ok.

08:11.293 --> 08:12.213
Thank you.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.684
You have to trust me.

08:21.227 --> 08:22.528
Until the lawyer arrives,

08:22.529 --> 08:24.589
I want you to stay here
and talk to no one.

08:32.693 --> 08:33.693
My purse.

08:33.693 --> 08:35.342
Where's my purse?

08:36.533 --> 08:37.563
Don't worry.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.809
It's still there.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.253
I'd never take it from you.

08:42.538 --> 08:43.568
Mr. Luthor.

08:44.342 --> 08:45.578
We have a situation.

08:48.814 --> 08:50.153
It's gonna be okay.

09:12.446 --> 09:14.500
I can't help but feel this
is some kind of warning.

09:14.501 --> 09:16.767
Clark, it was nothing
but a bad dream.

09:17.065 --> 09:18.466
You used to have
nightmares all the time...

09:18.467 --> 09:19.448
when you were
little, remember?

09:19.449 --> 09:20.685
This time is different.

09:21.164 --> 09:23.121
It felt so real.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.166
And if it is a warning
I need to do something.

09:25.167 --> 09:26.308
Yeah, what
you need to do...

09:26.309 --> 09:27.028
is you need to get
some shuteye...

09:27.029 --> 09:29.168
so that you're not
half asleep tomorrow...

09:29.169 --> 09:29.916
when they hand
you that diploma.

09:29.917 --> 09:30.880
Your dad's right,

09:30.881 --> 09:33.668
Don't let a nightmare spoil
your high school graduation.

09:33.678 --> 09:34.845
Nightmare?

09:35.263 --> 09:36.943
So that's what all this
commotion is about?

09:37.587 --> 09:38.514
Lois.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.291
You know, if it makes
you feel any better...

09:40.292 --> 09:41.904
I have 'em all the time.

09:43.986 --> 09:45.513
I had this one last week...

09:46.080 --> 09:47.316
really scary!

09:47.677 --> 09:49.016
This, uh...

09:50.188 --> 09:51.733
guy wearing a red cape.

09:52.547 --> 09:53.989
Oh, that sounds
horrible, Lois.

09:55.212 --> 09:56.242
Yeah!

09:56.742 --> 09:58.851
There's something I wanted
to tell all you guys,

09:58.852 --> 10:00.142
I just didn't know when to,

10:00.143 --> 10:01.688
so I guess 2 A.M.
in the morning...

10:01.707 --> 10:03.767
is good as time as any.
What is it, Lois?

10:04.533 --> 10:06.260
Oh, The general
recruited me...

10:06.261 --> 10:08.333
on a recon mission
to track down my sister,

10:08.334 --> 10:09.666
the grifter, in Europe.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.667
So, we are headed
for Heidelberg tomorrow.

10:11.668 --> 10:14.171
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

10:15.709 --> 10:18.366
Clark, I know how
devastated you must be...

10:18.367 --> 10:19.500
but if you could just...

10:19.731 --> 10:22.409
keep your tears to a
minimum, I'd appreciate it.

10:22.634 --> 10:23.664
I'll try.

10:25.451 --> 10:26.584
Thanks.

10:29.349 --> 10:30.443
Mr. and Mrs. Kent,

10:30.444 --> 10:32.992
I just wanted to say
thanks for everything.

10:32.993 --> 10:33.957
You guys are...

10:33.958 --> 10:37.048
like the mom and dad I've
always wanted to have.

10:38.509 --> 10:39.833
Lois, we want you
to know that...

10:39.834 --> 10:40.998
you are welcome
back here any time.

10:40.999 --> 10:43.356
Actually...
We'll all miss you, Lois.

10:46.391 --> 10:48.158
I'll miss you all, too.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.389
Him...

10:50.820 --> 10:51.850
not so much.

11:12.890 --> 11:15.053
I'd thought I do
Miss Lang a favor and...

11:15.066 --> 11:16.817
tidy up the place a bit.

11:20.660 --> 11:23.132
She left a quite
a mess, quite a mess.

11:25.225 --> 11:26.667
What are you
looking for, dad?

11:27.207 --> 11:29.438
The good housekeeping
seal of approval?

11:29.439 --> 11:32.114
You know, for a
woman without a heart...

11:32.724 --> 11:35.808
Genevieve Teague certainly
did have a lot of blood.

11:36.286 --> 11:38.486
You didn't come here
to do a postmortem...

11:38.487 --> 11:39.394
on Genevieve Teague.

11:39.395 --> 11:40.940
What is it you want?

11:42.181 --> 11:43.726
I'd like to offer a trade.

11:48.696 --> 11:51.065
Lana Lang's freedom...

11:51.443 --> 11:52.988
in exchange for the, hmm,

11:53.438 --> 11:55.086
artifact she has
in her possession.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.454
Dad, don't you
think your search...

11:57.455 --> 11:59.021
for these three
ancient stones...

11:59.054 --> 12:01.722
is starting to border
on the fanatical?

12:01.723 --> 12:03.268
Let me remind you, Lex,

12:04.231 --> 12:07.527
it was you who looted
the ruins of Egypt...

12:09.585 --> 12:11.233
to get your hands on
one of those stones.

12:12.172 --> 12:14.644
Trust me, Lana Lang has
nothing to do with this.

12:15.054 --> 12:16.683
Oh, so chivalrous of you.

12:17.116 --> 12:18.255
You are the gallant
hero trying...

12:18.256 --> 12:21.346
to protect the
damsel in distress.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.212
I'm warning you.

12:25.861 --> 12:26.994
Leave her alone!

12:27.367 --> 12:28.907
But all your life
you've had a, uh,

12:28.908 --> 12:31.422
a tendency
to let the damsel...

12:31.423 --> 12:34.925
lead you straight into
the mouth of the dragon.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.251
Your feelings for Miss Lang,

12:38.252 --> 12:41.318
don't let them cripple
your common sense, son.

12:44.126 --> 12:47.319
I expect to see that
stone by noon tomorrow.

12:48.308 --> 12:50.677
It would be a shame if,
um, Genevieve's corpse...

12:50.706 --> 12:51.927
were delivered
to the sheriff...

12:51.928 --> 12:55.018
with Lana Lang's
DNA as postage.

13:22.853 --> 13:23.780
Sir,

13:23.950 --> 13:26.216
you better take a look
at the right ascension.

13:29.577 --> 13:30.946
How long has
there been activity?

13:30.947 --> 13:32.857
There was not anything
there 10 seconds ago.

13:32.858 --> 13:34.544
It just came out
of nowhere.

13:41.728 --> 13:43.170
My God,

13:43.359 --> 13:45.110
it's headed
straight for Earth!

14:04.853 --> 14:06.426
I realize hand-eye
coordination...

14:06.427 --> 14:07.827
isn't one of your
best qualities.

14:07.828 --> 14:08.665
Here,

14:09.301 --> 14:10.743
let me help you with that.

14:11.364 --> 14:13.284
Lois, I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do without you.

14:13.941 --> 14:15.031
Ah, come on, Clark,

14:15.034 --> 14:17.094
your future is laid out
right in front of you.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.720
You're gonna go
to community college,

14:19.002 --> 14:22.209
major in agriculture, probably
minor in law enforcement.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.549
And then you
and Lana gonna have...

14:23.550 --> 14:24.994
a nice little
church wedding.

14:24.995 --> 14:26.025
Excuse me?

14:26.093 --> 14:28.151
It's written in the
stars and you know it.

14:28.152 --> 14:29.045
It's only a
matter of time...

14:29.046 --> 14:30.052
before you join
the bowling league...

14:30.053 --> 14:32.009
and take over the family
farm, and then, well,

14:32.495 --> 14:35.791
you and Lana can bring little
Clark Jr. into the world.

14:36.284 --> 14:37.629
I think you're
hallucinating.

14:37.630 --> 14:40.747
No. Hallucinating
would be imagining...

14:40.748 --> 14:42.462
Clark Kent going
off to the...

14:42.463 --> 14:44.497
big city to make his
mark in the world.

14:44.498 --> 14:46.200
I'm just being realistic.

14:48.578 --> 14:49.505
Lois,

14:49.579 --> 14:51.012
what are your big
plans after Europe,

14:51.013 --> 14:51.882
you're gonna go
back to school?

14:51.883 --> 14:53.792
Maybe actually stay
a little while?

14:54.025 --> 14:56.497
I have a feeling that if I'm
gonna get an education,

14:56.724 --> 14:58.063
it's gonna be
in the real world.

14:58.511 --> 15:00.855
And I took this career
test in some magazine.

15:01.082 --> 15:02.683
It said that my perfect
job would be, uh,

15:02.684 --> 15:04.221
radio disc jockey.

15:04.222 --> 15:05.729
That makes sense,
you talk enough,

15:05.730 --> 15:07.790
there won't be
any dead air.

15:08.688 --> 15:10.780
You mock me now Smallville,
but you just wait and see.

15:10.781 --> 15:11.873
Journalism,

15:11.874 --> 15:12.733
do you ever thought
about that?

15:12.734 --> 15:14.706
You wrote some
half decent articles...

15:14.707 --> 15:15.689
in your short lived
career at the Torch.

15:15.690 --> 15:16.786
Naw, kill me first.

15:16.789 --> 15:17.922
Even if I could spell,

15:18.025 --> 15:19.013
the last thing
I'd wanna do...

15:19.014 --> 15:20.256
is spent my time
in a newsroom.

15:20.257 --> 15:22.548
With my luck I'd probably
end up across the desk...

15:22.549 --> 15:25.639
from the most bumbling
reporter on the masthead.

15:29.591 --> 15:31.014
You know what?

15:31.151 --> 15:32.825
You actually look
handsome for a change.

15:33.359 --> 15:35.434
I'll take that
as a compliment.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.773
Look, I know we've had our
disagreements in the past.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.742
And I will be the
first to admit...

15:40.743 --> 15:41.963
that I've made
own little hobby...

15:41.964 --> 15:43.069
to bust your chops.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.645
Gotten used to it.

15:44.646 --> 15:47.118
Besides, I know I haven't
been the most gracious host.

15:48.524 --> 15:50.782
Look, I just want
you to know, Clark,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.327
that when I'm sitting in
the audience today...

15:52.328 --> 15:53.027
at your graduation...

15:53.028 --> 15:54.290
and you stand up
on that stage...

15:54.291 --> 15:57.319
in front of all
those people...

15:57.320 --> 15:59.586
I wanna be looking up at
you and thinking one thing.

16:00.649 --> 16:01.576
What's that?

16:02.274 --> 16:04.816
Please, god,
don't let him trip!

16:05.588 --> 16:06.320
See you.

16:13.238 --> 16:14.610
Garon Cooper.

16:17.817 --> 16:19.156
Caroline Creese.

16:22.078 --> 16:23.520
Cody Davis.

16:26.412 --> 16:27.442
Erica Feldman.

16:31.039 --> 16:32.275
Lauren Feldman.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.332
Did you see Lana yet?

16:34.333 --> 16:35.557
Still no sign.

16:35.558 --> 16:37.103
I'm starting to get worried.

16:37.119 --> 16:38.679
Lana's never so much
as had a tardy day.

16:38.769 --> 16:40.829
She's not gonna miss her
high school graduation.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.706
She'll be here.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.203
Michael Hall.

16:53.958 --> 16:55.297
Holy Harold.

16:56.592 --> 16:57.622
Tanya Hart.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.008
Kate Horton.

17:05.964 --> 17:06.892
Michael Hoover.

17:08.507 --> 17:09.537
Hannah Jacobs.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.493
Michelle Jewel.

17:11.494 --> 17:12.525
Oh, there's Clark.

17:14.579 --> 17:15.608
Clark Kent.

17:26.675 --> 17:27.704
Lana Lang.

17:30.920 --> 17:31.950
Have you seen her?

17:32.784 --> 17:34.020
Lana Lang.

17:47.538 --> 17:48.671
Attention!

17:48.985 --> 17:50.118
Stay calm!

17:50.600 --> 17:52.660
By order of the Federal
Emergency Decree:

17:53.063 --> 17:56.150
All non-essential personnel
should evacuate...

17:56.151 --> 17:57.848
the area within a
50 miles radius.

17:57.849 --> 17:59.497
In approximately 3 hours,

17:59.521 --> 18:01.993
a meteor shower is
predicted in Smallville.

18:05.962 --> 18:07.198
Oh, My God.

18:07.839 --> 18:09.281
Not again.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.506
Please stay calm.

18:13.553 --> 18:15.116
There's no need to panic.

18:15.117 --> 18:18.471
Please seal your home and
carry only necessary items.

18:18.553 --> 18:19.417
Hey, Clark.

18:19.427 --> 18:20.766
Can you believe it?

18:20.859 --> 18:22.070
Twice in 16 years,

18:22.071 --> 18:22.868
I mean, this is just crazy!

18:22.869 --> 18:24.166
Smallville's gotta
have some sort...

18:24.167 --> 18:25.592
of extraterrestrial
bulls eye!

18:25.593 --> 18:26.755
That's pretty weird, eh?

18:26.756 --> 18:28.932
There's gotta be some kind
of connection in the cosmos.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.993
I mean this is not
just a coincidence.

18:31.522 --> 18:33.341
Yeah, I'm sure there is
some sort of explanation.

18:33.342 --> 18:35.457
Well, there's just
something in Smallville...

18:35.458 --> 18:37.715
that is screaming
for celestial attention.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.820
I mean, lightening not strike
twice in the same place...

18:39.821 --> 18:42.455
without some kind
of lightning rod, right?

18:42.456 --> 18:43.687
I just wonder what that is.

18:43.688 --> 18:46.277
I-I'm not sure, but we
don't much time,

18:46.278 --> 18:47.194
we need to find Lana.

18:47.195 --> 18:49.007
You're right, and if
anyone can find her...

18:49.008 --> 18:50.528
with moments to
spare, it's you, Clark.

18:51.254 --> 18:52.596
Why did you say that?

18:52.695 --> 18:54.228
I don't know, because
you have a way...

18:54.229 --> 18:55.675
of getting things
done in half the time...

18:55.676 --> 18:57.037
a normal person
gets anything done.

18:57.207 --> 18:59.254
And I'm not normal?

18:59.411 --> 19:01.079
No, of course you
are normal, Clark.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.319
You're as normal
as they come.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.661
Now, let's hurry
and to find Lana.

19:03.662 --> 19:05.088
Looks, I'm sure she's
already out of town.

19:05.089 --> 19:06.529
They've evacuated
half of the county.

19:06.825 --> 19:07.985
They probably saw
her running in late...

19:07.986 --> 19:09.066
and told her to leave town.

19:09.353 --> 19:11.354
That's exactly you two
need to do, right now.

19:11.636 --> 19:13.437
Thanks for the tip.
Now listen to me, Smallville,

19:13.438 --> 19:15.238
If there's one thing that the
General has taught me...

19:15.239 --> 19:17.126
is that you cannot panic...

19:17.127 --> 19:18.623
in times of crisis.
Do you hear me?

19:18.624 --> 19:19.658
Okay, whatever happens,

19:19.659 --> 19:21.416
you have to stay calm.
You cannot panic.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.443
Because if you
lose your cool...

19:22.444 --> 19:24.499
Lois! What?
You're panicking.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.185
Fine.

19:44.515 --> 19:45.710
Clark, where the
hell have you been?

19:45.764 --> 19:46.691
We gotta pack up.

19:46.692 --> 19:47.903
I've been looking for
Lana everywhere.

19:47.904 --> 19:48.864
I can't find her.

19:48.865 --> 19:50.612
Sweetheart, she's probably
already been evacuated.

19:50.684 --> 19:51.624
I want you to go up to
your room and pack...

19:51.625 --> 19:53.105
everything that's
necessary.

19:53.106 --> 19:54.618
Your mom and I will take
care of everything down here.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.529
No, I gotta
do something first.

19:58.110 --> 20:00.216
Don't think for a
second this is your fault.

20:00.997 --> 20:03.533
I came to Smallville
in a meteor shower.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.636
Now it's happening again
and it's all because of me.

20:05.673 --> 20:06.934
Clark, there is
absolutely nothing you...

20:06.935 --> 20:07.958
could have done
to prevent this.

20:07.959 --> 20:08.874
We don't know that.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.126
There's gotta be
something I can do.

20:10.127 --> 20:12.389
Clark, you don't have time.

20:13.014 --> 20:14.735
I don't have a choice.

20:45.195 --> 20:47.502
Lex, what are
you doing here?

20:48.798 --> 20:50.368
I wanted to offer to
you and your parents...

20:50.369 --> 20:53.287
a safe passage out of
here in a LuthorCorp jet.

20:53.288 --> 20:54.948
The roads will be
pretty ugly soon.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.094
Thanks, but I think
we'll be okay.

21:02.752 --> 21:04.368
Clark, why take the risk?

21:04.677 --> 21:06.327
The first meteor
shower caused me...

21:06.328 --> 21:07.977
irrevocable damage.
Trust me,

21:07.978 --> 21:09.963
you don't want to be near
here when the next one hits.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.260
Thanks, Lex, but
I think my dad's...

21:11.261 --> 21:11.961
gonna wanna
pack up the truck...

21:11.962 --> 21:13.439
with as much
as we can take.

21:14.551 --> 21:15.721
I understand.

21:15.722 --> 21:18.812
Some things simply
can't be replaced.

21:22.011 --> 21:24.155
Clark, my scientists
have identified...

21:24.156 --> 21:25.380
what seems to be
an inner chamber...

21:25.381 --> 21:27.779
inside the cave wall.

21:29.020 --> 21:29.773
Really?

21:29.842 --> 21:31.774
I was wondering if your
research into the cave...

21:31.775 --> 21:33.765
might have turned up
anything similar.

21:35.219 --> 21:36.732
No. Lex, why are
you so interested...

21:36.733 --> 21:37.481
in the caves
when there's...

21:37.482 --> 21:39.485
a natural disaster
headed our way?

21:39.486 --> 21:41.580
Clark, if anything in this
town is irreplaceable...

21:41.581 --> 21:43.646
it's those caves.

21:43.647 --> 21:45.576
They've been around
for thousands of years...

21:45.577 --> 21:46.974
and they can very well be
destroyed in the next...

21:46.975 --> 21:48.807
Well, let's hope
they're not.

21:49.023 --> 21:51.678
I really need to get to help
my parents. Good luck, Lex.

21:52.959 --> 21:55.754
Thanks, Clark, but
I don't believe in luck.

21:55.755 --> 21:58.634
It's our wits and our
fortitude to keep us safe.

22:01.615 --> 22:04.753
And I'm sure you have
more than enough of both.

22:06.751 --> 22:08.343
Stay safe.

22:26.354 --> 22:28.111
You're my father.

22:28.445 --> 22:30.266
Talk to me.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.593
Tell me what you've done!

22:35.865 --> 22:39.035
<i>"It was you who brought
this upon yourself, Kal-El. "</i>

22:39.118 --> 22:40.376
What did I do?

22:40.613 --> 22:43.034
<i>"I sent you here to
unite the 3 elements. "</i>

22:43.035 --> 22:46.474
The stones? They have
nothing to do with me!

22:46.522 --> 22:49.337
<i>"But they do, Kal-El.
For the knowledge...</i>

22:49.338 --> 22:51.290
<i>of the universe is
meant for you only. "</i>

22:51.801 --> 22:54.255
<i>"Yet you chose
to deny your heritage. "</i>

22:54.477 --> 22:57.410
<i>"Today, you will witness
the consequences. "</i>

22:57.611 --> 22:59.403
Then you send
the meteor shower?

22:59.404 --> 23:01.639
<i>"I have done nothing, Kal-El."</i>

23:01.648 --> 23:04.299
<i>"Human blood has
stained one of the elements..."</i>

23:04.300 --> 23:05.955
<i>"and awakened a great danger..."</i>

23:05.956 --> 23:07.493
<i>"from the darkness of the space."</i>

23:07.494 --> 23:09.303
What can I do to stop it?

23:09.504 --> 23:11.176
<i>"There is nothing you can do..."</i>

23:11.177 --> 23:13.433
<i>"to prevent what is
already in motion."</i>

23:13.434 --> 23:16.379
<i>"But the meteor shower
is just beginning, Kal-El. "</i>

23:16.429 --> 23:19.354
<i>"I warned you that the
elements could not fall"</i>

23:19.360 --> 23:23.845
<i>"into the hands of a human.
The three must become one."</i>

23:23.871 --> 23:26.871
<i>"It is the only way to save
Earth from total annihilation. "</i>

23:26.872 --> 23:31.717
I don't know where they are!
I don't have time to find them!

23:31.832 --> 23:35.617
<i>"If you don't unite them
at once, you, my son,"</i>

23:35.630 --> 23:38.650
<i>"will be seared by a fire from the sky"</i>

23:38.659 --> 23:42.659
<i>"even you can't survive.
The future of mankind"</i>

23:42.760 --> 23:45.430
<i>"rests in your hands, Kal-El. "</i>

23:45.439 --> 23:48.590
Please.. help me!
I can't do this alone!

24:05.834 --> 24:07.811
I can't believe
I almost forgot this!

24:08.449 --> 24:09.464
That's great, sweetheart,

24:09.465 --> 24:10.791
I almost have the
truck all loaded up.

24:10.792 --> 24:11.689
Great.

24:12.548 --> 24:13.686
Shelby, load up.

24:15.059 --> 24:19.253
Clark, great. Would you
help me secure the truck?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.340
You have to go without me.

24:22.341 --> 24:23.559
What?

24:25.314 --> 24:27.018
Do I have to
remind you, Clark,

24:27.019 --> 24:28.460
that the last time we
had a meteor shower,

24:28.645 --> 24:29.848
was full of Kryptonite.

24:29.849 --> 24:31.587
If the same happens
today it could kill you.

24:31.588 --> 24:33.648
You have to come with us.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.695
I spoke to Jor-El.

24:40.233 --> 24:42.647
He told me I have to find the
other two stones right now.

24:43.028 --> 24:44.456
And unite them with
the one in the cave.

24:44.457 --> 24:47.574
No.
You are my son.

24:47.575 --> 24:49.720
You're not gonna go on
some kind of suicide mission.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.483
Clark, you might be
stronger than steel,

24:51.484 --> 24:52.476
but you're not invincible.

24:52.477 --> 24:56.845
I know, dad. But I'm the
only one who can do this.

25:09.494 --> 25:10.875
All right.

25:14.986 --> 25:18.168
But I want you to listen
to me right now.

25:18.681 --> 25:21.552
All the years that
your mother and I...

25:21.553 --> 25:23.889
spent raising
you from that...

25:23.890 --> 25:25.991
wide-eyed tattler running
around on this farm...

25:26.095 --> 25:28.807
to the man who is standing
in front of me right now...

25:31.412 --> 25:33.303
was for this moment.

25:41.556 --> 25:43.870
You do this, son.
You make us proud.

26:20.402 --> 26:22.744
Those meteors can
kill him, Jonathan.

26:24.758 --> 26:26.822
I know that, sweetheart.

26:30.259 --> 26:31.838
But we have
faith in our son,

26:31.950 --> 26:34.282
then we can't let
that faith waver now.

26:47.904 --> 26:50.897
Lana, I thought you
already evacuated.

26:51.753 --> 26:52.600
Are you okay?

26:52.673 --> 26:54.064
I'm scared.

26:56.159 --> 26:57.410
Lana, I know this
meteor shower...

26:57.411 --> 26:59.492
must bring up some
painful memories for you...

26:59.959 --> 27:01.090
but this time is different.

27:01.091 --> 27:03.283
We have warning
and we'll be safe.

27:03.284 --> 27:05.887
No, I'm not so sure.

27:05.888 --> 27:08.153
Clark, I don't know what's
going to happen to me.

27:09.076 --> 27:10.770
I want you to have this.

27:27.965 --> 27:29.508
Where did you get this?

27:32.169 --> 27:33.427
In China.

27:36.449 --> 27:39.642
Whatever it is,
whatever it means, I...

27:41.755 --> 27:44.065
I somehow know
that it's meant for you.

27:46.015 --> 27:47.462
Is this blood?

27:49.726 --> 27:51.515
Remembers all those
times that I asked you...

27:51.516 --> 27:54.307
for an explanation, but you
said you couldn't me one.

27:54.308 --> 27:56.399
That I had to trust you?

27:58.383 --> 28:00.641
Well, this time
I need you to trust me.

28:04.506 --> 28:06.097
Lana, my parents are
about to leave right now.

28:06.098 --> 28:07.736
Go with them.
You'll be safe.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.267
I can't.
You have to.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.471
Clark, I need you to know...

28:14.472 --> 28:17.516
that whatever happens,
I will never forget you.

28:23.899 --> 28:25.180
Lana, you're talking like
we never gonna see...

28:25.181 --> 28:26.417
each other again.

28:29.076 --> 28:30.915
I love you.

28:46.262 --> 28:47.731
I love you, too.

28:51.467 --> 28:53.699
Good-bye.

29:13.967 --> 29:16.309
Chloe, even though you
won't hear from me for a while,

29:16.310 --> 29:18.407
I want you to know
that I'm okay.

29:18.741 --> 29:21.240
I thought we'd agreed you
wouldn't talk to anyone.

29:21.241 --> 29:22.901
I have to let my friends
know that I'm all right.

29:22.902 --> 29:24.573
Lana, I understand you
not want anyone to worry,

29:24.574 --> 29:26.620
but you have to trust me.

29:26.670 --> 29:28.878
Now, I assume the
stone is still safe.

29:29.820 --> 29:31.266
As safe as can be.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.511
Well, let's keep it this way.
I'll put it in my vault.

29:36.430 --> 29:37.283
Why?

29:40.105 --> 29:42.575
A chopper is being fueled to
evacuate you to Metropolis,

29:42.576 --> 29:45.567
where you'll stay at a hotel
until your lawyer arrives.

29:45.568 --> 29:48.197
It's probably best not to travel
with the murder weapon.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.146
I understand that, Lex,
but I'd rather hold on to it.

29:53.024 --> 29:58.470
Lana, that object is what
prosecutors fondly refer to...

29:58.471 --> 30:00.396
as the smoking gun.

30:00.397 --> 30:02.869
Now, I'll do anything
I can to protect you...

30:02.870 --> 30:04.066
including supporting
whatever...

30:04.067 --> 30:06.245
story of self-defense
you want to run with.

30:08.399 --> 30:10.974
It's not a story, Lex.

30:12.047 --> 30:15.137
I would never
murder somebody.

30:15.999 --> 30:18.622
Of course not.

30:21.484 --> 30:27.149
Lana, I trust you.

30:27.150 --> 30:30.061
Now you have to trust
me with that stone.

30:32.837 --> 30:36.509
Sorry, Lex,
but I can't do that.

30:57.901 --> 30:59.019
Jason?

31:02.286 --> 31:03.613
Jason!

31:07.605 --> 31:08.897
Shelby, no.

31:08.898 --> 31:11.473
I'm having what you
could call a rough day.

31:12.321 --> 31:15.439
Why don't you just
calm down, son?

31:16.330 --> 31:18.244
Where is Clark?

31:21.736 --> 31:23.061
He's not here.

31:23.062 --> 31:24.955
Look, why don't you
put down the shotgun,

31:24.956 --> 31:27.016
and we'll talk about it?

31:28.643 --> 31:29.899
Tell me where he is!

31:59.146 --> 31:59.944
Why would Lana be
at the Lex's mansion...

31:59.945 --> 32:01.606
when she's suppose
to evacuate?

32:01.607 --> 32:02.786
I don't know,
but it could swear...

32:02.787 --> 32:04.665
that was Lex's voice
in the background.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.358
She sounds like
she's in trouble, Lois.

32:06.496 --> 32:07.450
I can't abandon
her, I mean,

32:07.451 --> 32:09.240
the mansion is
just around that bend.

32:09.241 --> 32:11.153
Unless you have a
jet pack in your purse...

32:11.154 --> 32:13.178
we're not going anywhere.

32:15.650 --> 32:16.636
Emergency vehicles only.

32:16.637 --> 32:18.476
Turn the car
around immediately.

32:18.477 --> 32:20.432
Well, our friend could
be trapped inside.

32:20.466 --> 32:21.813
We just gonna go grab her
and then come right back.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.591
I'm sorry, mam.
Nobody gets trough.

32:27.263 --> 32:28.941
We're way too
close to turn away.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.826
Hey, soldier!

32:36.947 --> 32:38.263
Is this a road block or...

32:38.264 --> 32:41.354
a lemonade stand
you got here?

32:41.557 --> 32:42.792
Wait a second,
I recognize you.

32:42.793 --> 32:43.492
You're the...

32:43.493 --> 32:45.662
Daughter of General Lane.
You might have heard of him.

32:45.663 --> 32:47.898
He talks really loud,
smokes a stogy.

32:49.038 --> 32:50.075
Hey!

32:52.195 --> 32:53.560
Hey, this barricade...

32:53.561 --> 32:55.144
it should be
perpendicular to the road.

32:55.145 --> 32:57.355
Those channelizers
should be further apart...

32:57.356 --> 33:00.096
and, unless I need glasses,

33:00.097 --> 33:01.974
there should be
reflectors on those cones.

33:01.975 --> 33:04.864
Yes, mam, I understand,
but I can't let you trough.

33:06.469 --> 33:08.125
You're a cub scout
out here soldier.

33:08.126 --> 33:11.216
Where's your den mother?
Baking brownies?

33:37.631 --> 33:39.847
What happened to your
survival instincts, dad?

33:40.561 --> 33:42.122
Fire and brimstone are
about to rain down...

33:42.123 --> 33:43.847
from the sky and you're
sipping a cocktail...

33:43.848 --> 33:45.717
like it's Sunday
at the country club.

33:45.756 --> 33:48.331
I am aware of the
imminent danger, Lex,

33:48.332 --> 33:49.438
but I'm not
about to leave...

33:49.439 --> 33:51.969
without knowing that
my son is all right...

33:51.970 --> 33:53.302
Come on, who's kidding who?

33:53.303 --> 33:55.775
You're not about to leave
without the element.

33:57.058 --> 33:58.152
I hate to disappoint you,

33:58.153 --> 33:59.957
but I haven't even
seen Lana Lang.

33:59.958 --> 34:02.162
She's probably on the run...

34:02.163 --> 34:03.757
halfway to
Costa Rica by now.

34:03.866 --> 34:06.292
Oh, a face like Lana
Lang's isn't easy to hide.

34:06.293 --> 34:07.611
It's just a matter
of time before...

34:07.612 --> 34:10.411
she catches the attention
of some customs official.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.639
All right.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.447
Agree to leave her alone,

34:24.449 --> 34:27.007
and I'll give you something
you desperately need.

34:27.087 --> 34:30.107
I am a blessed man, Lex,
I need very little in life.

34:30.108 --> 34:31.496
I wonder,

34:31.496 --> 34:35.291
what good is a key if you
don't know where the lock is?

34:35.292 --> 34:36.594
Wise observation,

34:36.596 --> 34:38.123
why do you think any
of this applies to me?

34:38.125 --> 34:39.797
You have one of
the elements, dad.

34:39.797 --> 34:40.547
That much is clear.

34:40.549 --> 34:44.774
What you don't have is the
knowledge of where it belongs.

34:44.815 --> 34:48.302
I can help you, take
you there right now.

34:48.303 --> 34:51.983
I wish I'd were true, Lex,
but I don't have the stone.

35:46.583 --> 35:49.520
Mr. Luthor,
what happened?

35:52.142 --> 35:54.676
Get J.D and take
my father upstairs.

35:54.677 --> 35:56.660
Mr. Luthor we're evacuating...
Do it!

36:03.925 --> 36:05.168
Can you hear me, dad?

36:10.435 --> 36:12.918
Before you leave this
earth, I want you to know...

36:15.087 --> 36:18.019
You did create the
son you always wanted.

37:41.244 --> 37:42.530
Come on, hurry up!

37:43.235 --> 37:44.534
Jason, why don't
you let Martha go?

37:44.535 --> 37:46.087
She doesn't know
anything about any of this.

37:46.088 --> 37:48.823
Oh, a mother always knows
her sons deep, dark secrets.

37:48.824 --> 37:50.685
Now, where does
he keeps the stones?

37:50.806 --> 37:51.788
Why would Clark
know anything...

37:51.789 --> 37:53.151
about ancient stones?

37:53.152 --> 37:55.483
All right.

37:55.716 --> 37:58.061
Let's see, when I ran into your
son in Shanghai,

37:58.367 --> 38:01.014
I decided to do a little
homework on my own.

38:01.015 --> 38:02.504
And the more I dogged the
more Clark Kent's name...

38:02.505 --> 38:04.565
just got popping up.

38:06.131 --> 38:09.605
Sit down!
Was it coincidence...

38:09.844 --> 38:11.693
that the symbols were
burned into your field?

38:11.694 --> 38:12.860
I don't know what
you're talking.

38:12.861 --> 38:13.891
Jason!

38:15.253 --> 38:16.907
What about Clark's connection
with Bridgette Crosby?

38:16.908 --> 38:18.619
I don't know.
I don't know.

38:18.620 --> 38:19.938
She had one
of the artifacts!

38:20.336 --> 38:22.830
I suppose that was
just a coincidence, too.

38:22.938 --> 38:24.678
None of that makes
any difference now.

38:26.593 --> 38:28.818
You know, when my
mother came to Smallville...

38:28.819 --> 38:31.111
she thought the Luthors
would lead her to the stones...

38:31.993 --> 38:35.504
But she was wrong.
It was a farm boy.

38:37.116 --> 38:39.752
The one who has no
record of ever been born.

38:39.755 --> 38:41.668
He's more connected to
those stones than any of us.

38:41.669 --> 38:44.212
There is a meteor shower
about to tear this town apart!

38:44.213 --> 38:46.645
You need to get to your
mother, get her to safety!

38:46.737 --> 38:50.027
Don't you think I know that?
I can't find her anywhere!

38:53.797 --> 38:56.357
But I'll tell you one thing.
When I do find my mother,

38:57.357 --> 38:59.158
I finally be able to give
her the one thing...

38:59.386 --> 39:01.158
she's been searching
for all these years.

39:06.766 --> 39:08.904
Now tell me where
the stones are!

39:18.880 --> 39:21.703
I'll meet you in Metropolis.
What? You're not coming?

39:22.689 --> 39:25.204
I have a pressing
matter to take care of.

39:25.435 --> 39:27.184
Now, Lana,
for your own safety:

39:27.185 --> 39:29.245
I need that stone.

39:32.055 --> 39:33.655
Look, we all have a need
to cling on to things,

39:33.656 --> 39:34.804
but eventually...

39:34.805 --> 39:36.208
you have to
loosen your grip.

39:36.209 --> 39:37.973
It's too dangerous to you.

39:37.974 --> 39:39.773
I don't have it!

39:40.330 --> 39:41.919
Lies don't become you.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.801
It's the truth, Lex.
I don't have it.

39:43.802 --> 39:46.169
Trust me it's safe,
I promise!

39:46.170 --> 39:47.725
Where is it?

39:49.661 --> 39:51.754
That was never about
my safety, was it?

39:52.570 --> 39:55.734
This is about you getting
your hands on that stone!

40:01.154 --> 40:07.288
Lana... your safety is more
important than any of this.

40:10.313 --> 40:12.916
You mean a lot more
to me than you know.

40:14.782 --> 40:16.674
We can't wait any
longer, Mr. Luthor.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.735
We got to go!

40:44.109 --> 40:46.595
Lana?
Lana?

40:52.922 --> 40:54.317
Oh my God, Clark.

41:17.018 --> 41:20.038
Lex, I was
looking for Lana.

41:20.112 --> 41:23.021
She's already left.
What happened?

41:23.238 --> 41:24.964
I don't know,
I just walked in.

41:28.089 --> 41:29.810
You know more than
you're telling me, Chloe.

41:30.635 --> 41:32.427
Who did this?

41:32.441 --> 41:35.319
Lex, honestly, I just
came to find Lana.

41:36.573 --> 41:38.905
Your curiosity seems
to always have a way...

41:38.906 --> 41:40.670
of landing you in
precarious conditions.

41:40.671 --> 41:43.607
Only this time you are on
a very narrow ledge...

41:43.608 --> 41:44.939
with only one-way back!

41:44.940 --> 41:46.769
Now, who took the element?

41:47.031 --> 41:49.422
Lex, I swear it, I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:49.869 --> 41:51.407
But I think we need to
get out of Smallville...

41:51.408 --> 41:52.506
before the meteor
shower hits.

41:52.507 --> 41:54.148
We'll find that
stone, Chloe,

41:54.149 --> 41:57.211
even if that means dodging
a few meteors in the process.

41:57.669 --> 41:58.611
You're coming with me.

41:58.612 --> 42:00.250
I don't...
Let's go!

42:00.310 --> 42:02.106
Lex, I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:07.303 --> 42:08.072
I swear to God,

42:08.073 --> 42:11.163
if you don't start talking
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

42:12.864 --> 42:13.842
Sweetheart, it's no good.

42:13.843 --> 42:15.140
Go ahead, tell him
what he wants to know.

42:15.141 --> 42:16.359
Tell him where
the stones are.

42:21.861 --> 42:23.415
Tell me what
I want to know.

42:25.529 --> 42:29.176
Go upstairs to
Clark's room.

44:01.887 --> 44:03.530
Oh my God.

44:51.753 --> 44:53.325
You're not my daddy.

44:56.115 --> 44:58.702
Come here, come here.
Daddy!

44:58.826 --> 45:01.724
Go! Go!

45:02.699 --> 45:04.366
Thank you.
Thank you!

46:34.053 --> 46:36.359
Why do I get the feeling we're
not in this cave for cover?

46:36.360 --> 46:39.440
You know as well as do.
It's the epicenter.

46:39.443 --> 46:42.231
Of what?
Come on, Chloe!

46:42.232 --> 46:45.214
You're the town purvey
of all things unexplained!

46:45.215 --> 46:47.618
You know damn well about
this cave and the stones.

46:47.619 --> 46:48.901
Lex, what's wrong with you?

46:48.902 --> 46:51.573
If you didn't break into my
library, you know who did?

46:51.574 --> 46:53.827
Who are you
trying to protect?

46:53.828 --> 46:56.045
No one.
Is it Clark?

46:56.251 --> 46:59.161
Clark?
Of course not.

46:59.162 --> 47:00.597
What does Clark have
to do with any of this?

47:00.598 --> 47:01.592
You tell me.

47:01.593 --> 47:04.161
You know Clark a lot
longer than I have.

47:04.162 --> 47:06.526
In fact, you might know
him better than anyone.

47:06.814 --> 47:09.323
You are right, Lex, I do.
And the Clark Kent I know...

47:09.580 --> 47:11.088
would be the last
person to go super thief...

47:11.089 --> 47:14.179
on your library for some
stupid piece of rock.

47:27.462 --> 47:29.412
What is that?

47:37.530 --> 47:40.234
Lex, be careful.
It might be dangerous.
