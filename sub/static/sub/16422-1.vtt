me a scandalous fool.

43:25.704 --> 43:27.035
Well, perhaps less so,

43:27.036 --> 43:29.736
not having had what you
said to him translated.

43:29.737 --> 43:31.069
Best not.

43:31.070 --> 43:32.137
Trust me.

43:33.370 --> 43:35.370
Well, there are other publishers.

43:36.670 --> 43:38.870
Perhaps Sir Richard might
advise on the way forward.

43:38.871 --> 43:39.670
No.

43:40.337 --> 43:43.103
His connections to
publishing are tenuous.

43:43.903 --> 43:46.503
He owns newspapers.

43:46.504 --> 43:49.302
Anna would rather succeed on
her own merits, wouldn't you?

43:49.303 --> 43:50.536
I hope to, but if Sir...

43:50.537 --> 43:52.337
There. Good.

43:53.570 --> 43:55.036
Is anything wrong?

43:57.103 --> 43:59.903
I'm simply missing Jack.

44:01.771 --> 44:04.703
I hope neither of you mind
if I head back to Inverness,

44:04.704 --> 44:06.936
see if the campaign needs a hand.

44:08.537 --> 44:10.203
(BABY WHINES, CRIES)

44:12.003 --> 44:15.102
You know what I really can't resolve?

44:15.103 --> 44:18.569
Not one of them has taken
my feelings into account.

44:18.570 --> 44:20.935
A decision is made, and
it's a fait accompli!

44:20.936 --> 44:24.202
- Okay. Okay.
- It is just so damned unfair!

44:24.203 --> 44:25.935
After all that I have suffered for them,

44:25.936 --> 44:27.035
they think they can just...

44:27.036 --> 44:29.870
Look, you have to admit he

44:29.871 --> 44:32.169
Ash Park, a nanny, his father.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.302
This isn't a decision they can make.

44:34.303 --> 44:35.935
Darling, I think they can.

44:35.936 --> 44:37.303
No.

44:40.936 --> 44:43.771
It's an unpalatable truth.

44:47.670 --> 44:49.303
Truth?

44:51.537 --> 44:54.437
We'd all buckle under
the weight of that.

44:55.837 --> 44:57.103
Me most of all.

45:00.771 --> 45:03.036
You want the truth?

45:07.637 --> 45:10.603
James isn't Georgie's father.

45:10.604 --> 45:11.736
But you said...

45:11.737 --> 45:13.804
I didn't give birth to him.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

45:17.771 --> 45:20.935
After my first attack, I interfered,

45:20.936 --> 45:25.436
to try to force my values, my
increasingly outmoded values,

45:25.437 --> 45:26.935
on you all.

45:26.936 --> 45:29.103
My motive was love.

45:29.537 --> 45:31.069
The outcome was unfortunate.

45:31.070 --> 45:33.102
So this time, I...

45:33.103 --> 45:37.436
I want to use my reprieve
to see you all happy...

45:37.437 --> 45:39.437
happily yourselves.

45:40.036 --> 45:41.902
I like this new grandmother.

45:41.903 --> 45:44.569
Mm. I do too, rather.

45:44.570 --> 45:46.102
And what about you?

45:46.103 --> 45:47.136
Mr. Goddard?

45:47.137 --> 45:50.069
No. With my prognosis, no.

45:50.070 --> 45:52.836
- Well, shouldn't you at least...
- No. He thinks I rejected him.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.870
Best left that way.

45:54.871 --> 45:56.302
Oh.

45:56.303 --> 45:57.770
Now, you know,

45:57.771 --> 46:00.536
I think your mother was
wrong about Sir Richard.

46:00.537 --> 46:03.369
Will you fetch me my book?
It's in my top drawer there.

46:03.370 --> 46:05.369
I thought you weren't interfering.

46:07.970 --> 46:09.404
Mm-hmm.

46:10.604 --> 46:12.437
Ah, yes.

46:14.936 --> 46:18.504
You're not... shocked?

46:21.804 --> 46:23.136
I am unshockable.

46:23.137 --> 46:25.537
(CHUCKLES)

46:26.003 --> 46:30.069
James was in no position
to deal with a stillborn.

You <i>can</i> see, I...

46:32.570 --> 46:36.503
I did it... for love.

46:36.504 --> 46:38.303
<i>I</i> understand.

46:38.903 --> 46:40.336
But they may not.

46:40.337 --> 46:44.303
Your actions were outrageous, Olivia.

46:44.771 --> 46:48.936
There was a sense to them at the time.

46:51.637 --> 46:53.636
Perhaps less so now.

46:53.637 --> 46:54.871
Mm.

46:56.771 --> 46:58.437
Lloyd?

46:59.370 --> 47:04.736
If I told them the truth... it
would guarantee me Georgie.

47:04.737 --> 47:06.603
Um, not necessarily.

47:06.604 --> 47:08.935
George would only go to court for blood.

47:08.936 --> 47:11.369
- He wouldn't fight for him.
- But James might.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.504
James has what he wants.

47:15.237 --> 47:17.370
James has his man.

This is not who I am.

(SIGHS)

47:34.103 --> 47:35.871
So what now?

47:41.070 --> 47:42.670
The truth.

47:45.970 --> 47:49.137
For the right reason.

47:52.470 --> 47:54.303
For our solution.

47:58.871 --> 48:00.935
He had his back up as soon
as he heard your name.

48:00.936 --> 48:03.369
Franklin clearly got in
his ear before he left.

48:03.370 --> 48:05.637
- You all right, then?
- I've handled worse.

48:06.203 --> 48:07.803
- Ruddy Doris.
- Hmm?

48:07.804 --> 48:10.203
You were done with your

48:10.771 --> 48:13.236
There are many ways
to be useful, Doctor.

48:13.237 --> 48:15.236
Yeah. Well, sniffing for
gossip isn't one of them.

48:15.237 --> 48:16.902
Scoot.

48:16.903 --> 48:20.569
Dr. Duncan can be so
abrasive in a crisis.

48:20.570 --> 48:22.969
An eventful day at school, I hear.

48:22.970 --> 48:26.002
It's given me a lot of
respect for teachers.

the news Mrs. Bligh and I have
formed a charming intimacy.

She's asked to be kept informed.

Of what?

48:39.704 --> 48:42.770
Of Milly's death, the
new police sergeant,

48:42.771 --> 48:44.002
what's being said.

48:44.003 --> 48:45.770
Did she know her?

48:45.771 --> 48:49.771
As Mrs. Bligh, her interests
are in all things Inverness.

48:50.370 --> 48:53.436
Imagine my thrill the other
day when she visited me

48:53.437 --> 48:56.637
and even stayed to help
me with my little tasks.

Mrs. Nordmann was telling
me how much she values it.

Oh, indeed, indeed.

If I could be so bold,

49:29.103 --> 49:31.569
perhaps more of that delicious cake?

Oh! Of course!

49:34.604 --> 49:36.035
