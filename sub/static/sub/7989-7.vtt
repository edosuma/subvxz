20:55.368 --> 20:58.402
Congratulations, Woz.
You almost got your rat.

21:01.307 --> 21:04.308
[monitor beeping, ventilator hissing]

21:07.413 --> 21:10.180
He looks peaceful.

21:10.182 --> 21:12.583
Don't let him fool you.

21:12.585 --> 21:16.053
He's fighting a war inside.

21:16.055 --> 21:17.855
My brave boy.

21:17.857 --> 21:20.124
He'll win.

21:22.762 --> 21:24.561
Who's she?

21:24.563 --> 21:28.932
Her name's Sofia. She
and David are friends.

21:28.934 --> 21:31.268
Doesn't look like someone
David would be friends with.

21:31.270 --> 21:33.404
I thought you might want some company.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.005
She... she's a nice girl.

21:35.007 --> 21:36.807
My son is company enough.

21:36.809 --> 21:39.243
I'll wait outside.

21:49.422 --> 21:51.588
Mrs. Sap, David and I
were working on a case,

21:51.590 --> 21:56.160
and I could really, really use his notes.

21:56.162 --> 21:57.227
I think they're at the house.

21:57.229 --> 21:58.796
You mind if I just let myself in?

21:58.798 --> 22:01.799
[scoffs] Of course not.

22:08.407 --> 22:11.408
[door buzzes]

22:13.746 --> 22:17.147
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Zepeda.

22:17.149 --> 22:18.515
My schedule opened up.

22:18.517 --> 22:22.085
I'm Special Agent Stahl.
This is Agent Chen.

22:22.087 --> 22:23.954
We're with the FBI.

22:23.956 --> 22:25.956
[laughs]

22:25.958 --> 22:28.292
Your case file says you've
got a big day coming up...

22:28.294 --> 22:30.594
habeas corpus appeal.

22:30.596 --> 22:32.529
Screwed by your own lawyer, huh?

22:32.531 --> 22:34.531
I been screwed by a lot of people.

22:34.533 --> 22:37.701
What's your relationship
with Harlee Santos?

22:37.703 --> 22:40.971
- Who says I got one?
- She visited you yesterday.

22:40.973 --> 22:43.307
Oh, yeah.

22:44.543 --> 22:45.742
Conjugal.

22:47.379 --> 22:51.381
I guess she can't get out there
what I can give her in here.

22:51.383 --> 22:53.050
Hope you're able to hide

22:53.052 --> 22:54.818
that crush better when she's around.

22:54.820 --> 22:57.921
We're trying to help, Mr. Zepeda.

22:57.923 --> 23:00.057
How do you know Harlee Santos?

23:00.059 --> 23:01.925
Harlee's just a girl
from the neighborhood.

23:01.927 --> 23:04.127
A couple friends asked her

23:04.129 --> 23:06.263
to help me get a little piece of justice.

23:06.265 --> 23:09.333
Is that piece named Frank Kovach?

23:09.335 --> 23:10.601
I don't remember.

23:10.603 --> 23:12.936
Stop me when you start remembering.

23:12.938 --> 23:15.506
You get sent up for a murder
you say you didn't commit.

23:15.508 --> 23:17.608
You get a second chance
to plead your case.

23:17.610 --> 23:19.977
Harlee visits you then goes after Kovach.

23:19.979 --> 23:21.445
Anything coming back to you?

23:21.447 --> 23:23.747
Wow.

23:23.749 --> 23:25.716
That's a lovely story.

23:25.718 --> 23:27.251
You should think about writing it down.

23:27.253 --> 23:29.119
Do you believe Frank Kovach was involved

23:29.121 --> 23:31.221
in the murder of Rita Martin?

23:31.223 --> 23:33.090
Ephesians 6:12!

23:33.092 --> 23:34.825
"For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood,

23:34.827 --> 23:36.026
but against principalities"...

23:36.028 --> 23:37.928
The woman that you are
convicted of murdering.

23:37.930 --> 23:39.730
"Against the rulers of
the darkness in this world,

23:39.732 --> 23:42.900
Against spiritual
wickedness in high places."

23:42.902 --> 23:46.203
How's the view from the
high places, Agent Stahl?

23:46.205 --> 23:47.771
You really think stonewalling us

23:47.773 --> 23:49.306
is in your best interest right now?

23:49.308 --> 23:50.307
Go screw yourself.

23:50.309 --> 23:52.709
Thank you for your time, inmate.

23:52.711 --> 23:54.311
Good luck with that appeal.

23:54.313 --> 23:56.713
Good luck with your crush.

23:59.285 --> 24:02.286
Miguel, you know that
story you liked so much?

24:02.288 --> 24:05.789
It ends with you serving
your life sentence.

24:05.791 --> 24:07.391
Frank Kovach is dead.

24:09.662 --> 24:11.461
And I sure hope you
weren't counting on him

24:11.463 --> 24:13.997
as part of your defense.

24:13.999 --> 24:17.768
[knock at door, door buzzes]

24:17.770 --> 24:20.470
I'll update you when we have more.

24:23.943 --> 24:25.208
You came to check on me?

24:25.210 --> 24:29.947
Not for long, I'm late for a deposition.

24:29.949 --> 24:33.450
Anything positive?

24:33.452 --> 24:35.152
This guy I like came to the hospital

24:35.154 --> 24:36.587
and sat with my daughter.

24:36.589 --> 24:38.021
Sounds like he's smitten with you.

24:38.023 --> 24:40.057
He'll be disillusioned soon.

24:40.059 --> 24:42.893
Too late. He's already fallen.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.996
Careful.

24:45.998 --> 24:48.465
Never fall for someone if
you don't know who they are.

24:48.467 --> 24:51.568
I got a pretty good sense.

24:51.570 --> 24:55.238
Of the part I let you see.

24:58.944 --> 25:01.244
I'm not a good person.

25:03.315 --> 25:05.515
You should stay away from me.

25:05.517 --> 25:07.684
That's grief talking.

25:10.222 --> 25:12.456
It should have been me
on that construction site.

25:12.458 --> 25:14.591
A lot of people are glad it wasn't.

25:17.563 --> 25:20.163
Give them time.

25:23.483 --> 25:25.351
You and Rita Martin were arrested together

25:25.353 --> 25:27.086
in the early 2000s several times.

25:27.088 --> 25:30.289
It's not exactly a phase of
my life I'm eager to revisit.

25:30.291 --> 25:32.625
Could you tuck in that corner?

25:34.629 --> 25:36.295
What was your relationship with Rita?

25:36.297 --> 25:38.731
Squatted together...
same tenement in Bushwick.

25:38.733 --> 25:41.634
- Were you friends?
- You could say that.

25:41.636 --> 25:44.937
- And then she was killed.
- Yeah.

25:44.939 --> 25:47.306
- Were you with her?
- No.

25:47.308 --> 25:50.009
I heard about it the next day.

25:51.412 --> 25:52.611
[cell phone beeps]

25:52.613 --> 25:54.680
<i>My... my friend Rita, she's bleeding.</i>

25:54.682 --> 25:56.448
<i>I think she's been stabbed.</i>

25:56.450 --> 25:58.184
<i>911, what is your location?</i>

25:58.186 --> 26:02.521
<i>Brownsville, 38... no, 98th and Lott.</i>

26:02.523 --> 26:04.723
<i>[crying] Oh, God, she's dead.</i>

26:04.725 --> 26:06.625
<i>Oh, she's dead.</i>

26:06.627 --> 26:07.760
Turn it off.

26:07.762 --> 26:11.230
<i>Oh, my God, I can't believe... </i>

26:13.067 --> 26:15.768
This recording wasn't
in the trial transcripts.

26:15.770 --> 26:18.771
We had to dig it out of
the original case file.

26:18.773 --> 26:20.940
No one tried to find this caller.

26:23.044 --> 26:25.644
You found her. You were her friend.

26:25.646 --> 26:27.680
Why didn't you come forward and follow up?

26:27.682 --> 26:30.416
Look, like I said, I was on the street.

26:30.418 --> 26:33.819
Did a Detective Wozniak talk
to you about Rita's murder?

26:33.821 --> 26:35.321
Nobody talked to me.

26:35.323 --> 26:38.157
You sure about that?

26:38.159 --> 26:41.126
Hey, you ever seen this guy before?

26:42.296 --> 26:43.929
I don't know who that is.

26:43.931 --> 26:45.097
This man...

26:45.099 --> 26:48.300
Believe me, if I could
help find Rita's killer,

26:48.302 --> 26:49.768
I would.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.237
She recognized him.

26:51.239 --> 26:52.471
Kovach?

26:52.473 --> 26:53.706
She witnessed that murder.

26:53.708 --> 26:56.609
She's been coached to say she hasn't.

26:56.611 --> 26:58.677
Know anybody else who likes
their witnesses rehearsed?

26:58.679 --> 27:01.413

- Oh, I sent her home.

She had practice, and, uh,
I thought it would be better

27:56.904 --> 27:58.737
if she would be around some friends.

28:00.274 --> 28:03.509
The doctor kept saying "uncertain."

28:03.511 --> 28:05.377
That's all I could hear.

28:07.515 --> 28:09.715
Everything's uncertain.

28:09.717 --> 28:11.417
Not everything.

28:11.419 --> 28:15.688
You have to go, Harlee, to Rikers, now.

28:15.690 --> 28:17.823
Kovach's name is being released.

28:17.825 --> 28:19.725
He's gonna be all over the news.

28:19.727 --> 28:21.927
If Miguel ever gets out, he can't know

28:21.929 --> 28:24.229
that you tried to throw
a wrench into his appeal.

28:24.231 --> 28:25.698
He won't believe me.

28:25.700 --> 28:26.965
It's too big a lie.

28:26.967 --> 28:28.334
He'll see it.

28:28.336 --> 28:32.137
You want to convince somebody
you're telling the truth...

28:32.139 --> 28:33.939
convince yourself first.

28:37.144 --> 28:40.012
Is that what you did last night?

28:42.750 --> 28:44.983
Woz?

28:44.985 --> 28:48.220
Is that what you did with me?

28:50.157 --> 28:53.659
What happened on that building?

28:53.661 --> 28:55.994
I asked Saperstein...

28:55.996 --> 29:00.499
if he was talking to the Feds...

29:00.501 --> 29:03.202
and he said he didn't have a choice.

29:05.940 --> 29:08.874
And I thought of you.

29:08.876 --> 29:11.777
I thought of Christina...

29:11.779 --> 29:14.913
and how she's gonna make us all so proud.

29:14.915 --> 29:17.282
And I thought of Linda

29:17.284 --> 29:20.185
and everything that I've
put her through already.

29:22.590 --> 29:26.558
Turns out I didn't have
a choice either, Harlee.

29:36.036 --> 29:37.669
He can never wake up.

29:39.707 --> 29:43.041
He's got a story that the
FBI's gonna want to hear.

29:45.513 --> 29:48.247
I did what I had to do.

29:50.751 --> 29:52.251
Kovach too?

29:52.253 --> 29:55.287
Kovach is Miguel's ticket out of prison.

29:55.289 --> 29:57.723
Miguel can't get out of prison.

29:57.725 --> 29:59.958
You know that.

30:06.634 --> 30:10.736
We're never really free
of our sins, are we?

30:10.738 --> 30:12.438
No.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.940
We can make them count.

30:18.145 --> 30:22.114
There's an FBI agent
outside of Saperstein's room.

30:25.619 --> 30:27.853
I need you to distract him.

30:27.855 --> 30:29.288
No.

30:29.290 --> 30:31.223
Harlee, we can't undo
what's already been done.

30:31.225 --> 30:32.224
No!

30:32.226 --> 30:33.525
Harlee, we need to move forward.

30:33.527 --> 30:36.462
He might not remember, okay?

30:36.464 --> 30:38.230
They don't even know how
much brain damage he has.

30:38.232 --> 30:39.932
He might not even wake up!

30:39.934 --> 30:42.067
- I can't take that chance.
- You have to.

30:42.069 --> 30:43.802
We both do, okay?

30:43.804 --> 30:45.537
This is not what we do.

30:45.539 --> 30:49.174
It never has been, and it can't be now.

30:49.176 --> 30:52.244
We do what we have to to survive, Harlee.

30:52.246 --> 30:54.780
You won't survive...

30:54.782 --> 30:57.549
not this.

30:57.551 --> 31:01.119
Look, I know that you want
to be strong for all of us.

31:01.121 --> 31:04.156
You want to protect us, protect me.

31:04.158 --> 31:07.459
But don't destroy yourself doing it!

It's too late for that.

No, it's not.

I... I understand.

31:29.016 --> 31:32.618
[voice breaking] But please, please...

I'm begging you. Promise me.

31:36.924 --> 31:39.358
Promise me...

31:39.360 --> 31:41.727
that you won't hurt him again.

Now two visits in two days.

32:38.180 --> 32:39.712
I found that parolee... Kovach.

32:39.714 --> 32:41.848
That's great.

32:41.850 --> 32:45.151
Why don't you pull the car
around and take me home?

32:45.153 --> 32:47.220
He's dead.

32:47.222 --> 32:50.657
Well, that's disappointing, isn't it?

32:50.659 --> 32:53.026
Who ended him?

32:53.028 --> 32:54.461
The police.

32:54.463 --> 32:57.297
It was a hostage situation.
He kidnapped his son.

32:57.299 --> 32:59.499
- When?
- Yesterday.

33:01.102 --> 33:03.570
Hell of a coincidence
he goes boosting his kid

33:03.572 --> 33:05.505
the same day you go looking for him.

33:05.507 --> 33:07.540
Wasn't a coincidence at all, you know.

33:07.542 --> 33:08.508
I spooked him.

33:08.510 --> 33:09.943
He took off, and there was a manhunt.

33:09.945 --> 33:12.779
So what you're saying is,
I trusted the wrong person.

33:12.781 --> 33:14.147
I was trying to help.

Kovach isn't the only one
who went off that building.

33:18.653 --> 33:21.621
A cop, good friend of mine, died too.

33:21.623 --> 33:24.457
You think I wanted that?

33:25.694 --> 33:28.595
Look, I...

33:28.597 --> 33:30.230
I'll go talk to his parole officer.

33:30.232 --> 33:31.965
Get a list of cellmates.

33:31.967 --> 33:35.034
Maybe they said something we can use.

33:36.071 --> 33:38.738
Look, I'll do whatever I can.

33:38.740 --> 33:40.273
No touching.

33:43.745 --> 33:45.578
Why?

33:45.580 --> 33:49.015
Even if you didn't set me up, I hurt you.

33:50.952 --> 33:52.819
I hurt you a lot.

33:52.821 --> 33:55.555
I was angry...

33:55.557 --> 33:58.424
for a long time.

33:58.426 --> 34:03.129
Everybody deserves a second chance.

34:03.131 --> 34:05.265
And I hope to meet

34:05.267 --> 34:08.701

34:13.341 --> 34:14.774
Saperstein wasn't dumb.

34:14.775 --> 34:16.509
You're not gonna find
anything in an outbox.

34:16.511 --> 34:18.244
The only thing I can prove
so far is that he was boring.

34:18.246 --> 34:19.978
He got hurt trying to protect a kid.

34:19.981 --> 34:21.648
Maybe we give him the
benefit of the doubt.

34:21.650 --> 34:23.283
I thought you'd be a little more invested.

34:23.284 --> 34:25.385
Hey, a woman named Sofia called for you.

34:25.387 --> 34:28.521
She says Saperstein's
cranial edema is subsiding.

34:28.523 --> 34:29.822
What does that mean?

34:29.824 --> 34:31.456
Well, the doctors think they may be able

34:31.458 --> 34:34.561
to reduce his sedation
by tomorrow morning...

34:34.563 --> 34:36.996
see if he wakes up.

34:46.174 --> 34:47.473
[door closes] What's up?

34:47.475 --> 34:49.442
He did it.

34:49.444 --> 34:52.445
Saperstein sold us out.

34:52.447 --> 34:54.714
I told you, we're gonna
let him speak for himself.

34:54.716 --> 34:56.516
This speaks for him...

34:56.518 --> 34:57.917

35:04.492 --> 35:06.225
He's been snitching on us for two weeks.

35:06.227 --> 35:09.629
Yesterday wasn't the first
time the Feds made contact.

35:09.631 --> 35:13.533
You know, it could have been
you that they approached.

35:13.535 --> 35:16.769
The FBI is very convincing.

35:18.340 --> 35:21.374
He came to me.

35:21.376 --> 35:23.543
Maybe it was to undo whatever got done.

35:23.545 --> 35:27.814
Or making sure he saw daylight
by getting us all on tape.

35:27.816 --> 35:30.817
He would have tried to protect you...

35:30.819 --> 35:32.318
all of us.

35:32.320 --> 35:36.222
Look, the bottom line is, we're all here.

35:36.224 --> 35:39.025
Let's just assume the best.

35:39.027 --> 35:43.229
How do I ever trust anybody again?

35:43.231 --> 35:44.731
Look at me.

35:44.733 --> 35:46.933
Come here. Look at me.

We're still a unit, aren't we?

35:51.439 --> 35:52.972
Yes, sir.

35:52.974 --> 35:56.542
And I got your back.

35:56.544 --> 36:00.113
I'd never let anything happen to you.

- Where's Mrs. Saperstein?

36:32.918 --> 36:36.185
Tufo took her home.

36:36.187 --> 36:39.222
Did you do what you needed to do?

36:39.224 --> 36:40.390
Hard to know.

36:40.392 --> 36:43.927
I mean, I did the dance.

36:43.929 --> 36:46.829
At best, Miguel doesn't
know what to think.

36:46.831 --> 36:49.132
I know the feeling.

36:51.036 --> 36:55.071
Saperstein is a lot tougher than he looks.

36:55.073 --> 36:57.206
Brain swelling's going down.

36:57.208 --> 37:00.977
He could be talking by morning.

37:08.119 --> 37:09.452
I'm gonna stay.

37:09.454 --> 37:11.621
It just doesn't feel right

37:11.623 --> 37:14.590
letting the Feds watch over him.

37:16.027 --> 37:20.096
What if he remembers everything?

37:20.098 --> 37:22.832
Then I'll sit in front of him

37:22.834 --> 37:25.668
and tell him my side.

37:25.670 --> 37:27.870
Explain why I did what I did.

37:27.872 --> 37:30.039
And...

37:30.041 --> 37:32.875
let him choose what happens to me.

37:39.284 --> 37:40.650
You're a good man.

37:40.652 --> 37:43.486
[scoffs] I'm okay.

37:57.869 --> 38:00.403

38:39.861 --> 38:41.661
That Wozniak has some interest in.

38:41.663 --> 38:44.430
He was the lead investigator
on the original case.

38:46.468 --> 38:48.101
He sent me. I didn't ask questions.

38:48.103 --> 38:49.869
Oh, I did.

38:49.871 --> 38:52.138
Zepeda came up with
some interesting answers.

38:52.140 --> 38:53.806

39:35.016 --> 39:36.182
No.
