00:22.352 --> 00:24.682
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I came in a few minutes ago

00:24.684 --> 00:25.985
with a patient,
Steve McGarrett.

00:26.052 --> 00:27.553
On the ambulance,
I remember.

00:27.621 --> 00:28.988
Can you give me the status
on his condition, please?

00:29.055 --> 00:30.222
I'm sorry, there's
no word yet.

00:30.307 --> 00:32.458
Um, can you make a call
or is there a doctor

00:32.525 --> 00:34.476
I can speak to?
Can I please speak...

00:34.544 --> 00:35.995
Who's his doctor?
Governor...

00:36.062 --> 00:38.680
What the hell happened
out there, Weston?

00:38.732 --> 00:41.250
I'm sorry, sir. This is
all... it's my fault.

00:41.318 --> 00:43.369
I don't want apologies,
I want explanations.

00:43.453 --> 00:45.204
I specifically told
you to keep me

00:45.288 --> 00:47.373
informed of every step
of this investigation.

00:47.457 --> 00:49.241
Instead, my head of
security is getting

00:49.326 --> 00:51.827
third-hand information
from HPD.

00:51.878 --> 00:53.712
Sir, we had just cause;
the suspect was fleeing.

00:53.797 --> 00:56.682
Time was of the essence.
We had to make a call.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.500
The call you should've
made was to me.

00:58.551 --> 01:00.753
In case you
forgot, Weston,

01:00.837 --> 01:02.671
I assigned you
to this task force

01:02.722 --> 01:05.007
to prevent exactly
this kind of disaster.

01:05.075 --> 01:08.193
Yes, sir.

01:08.261 --> 01:12.398
When this is all over, you're
going to have to make a choice:

01:13.750 --> 01:16.352
the state of Hawaii
or Five-O.

01:16.403 --> 01:18.988
Code Blue to the ER,
Room 4.

01:19.055 --> 01:20.689

02:17.747 --> 02:19.832
for your 48-hour weekend.

02:19.916 --> 02:24.136
Would I rather be drinking beers
at Haleiwa Joe's right now?

02:24.220 --> 02:25.287
Sure.

02:25.338 --> 02:26.805

I get it.

turn down the governor

02:28.291 --> 02:29.808

as his special guest.

Especially when, uh, the
plates are $5,000 a pop,

02:32.412 --> 02:34.629
and he bought the whole table.
Ooh.

02:34.681 --> 02:36.231
That being said, you look
absolutely beautiful

02:36.299 --> 02:37.349
in your dress tonight.

02:37.434 --> 02:38.650
Thank you.

this thing's over,
these heels are coming off.

02:41.821 --> 02:44.289
I was hoping you were
going to say that.

02:44.357 --> 02:46.792
Ladies and Gentlemen,

02:46.860 --> 02:48.777
this is just a reminder
that the silent auction

02:48.845 --> 02:50.796
will be closing
in five minutes.

02:50.864 --> 02:53.298
So, please, put your
final bids in now.

02:53.366 --> 02:55.367
The Clean Coast Fund
needs your dollars

02:55.452 --> 02:58.971
to preserve Hawaii's
precious marine environment.

02:59.039 --> 03:00.789
<i>Mahalo,</i> everyone.

03:02.208 --> 03:05.794
Well, look who is pitching in
to, uh, to save the environment.

03:05.845 --> 03:07.679
This is the steal
of the century.

03:07.747 --> 03:10.632
Season tickets, 50-yard line,
half face value. I'm in.

03:10.683 --> 03:11.767
Didn't know you
were a fan, Danny.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.185
That's 'cause
he's not.

03:13.269 --> 03:15.304
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

03:15.355 --> 03:16.855
A) I'm a huge football fan.

03:16.940 --> 03:19.441
And B) the Warriors
uniforms remind me

03:19.509 --> 03:20.793
of my beloved
Jets. And C)

03:20.860 --> 03:23.228
this is, uh,
charity. Right?

03:23.296 --> 03:24.863
You're right.
And it's good to see

03:24.948 --> 03:26.115
you got your
priorities straight.

03:26.182 --> 03:28.067
So, excuse me for a second.

03:28.151 --> 03:29.068
What are you doing?

03:29.152 --> 03:32.571
I'm, um... feeling charitable.

03:32.655 --> 03:33.989
Why would
you do that?

03:34.040 --> 03:35.841
You have a very big problem,
you know that?

03:35.909 --> 03:37.159
You're competitive.

03:37.210 --> 03:38.460
He's got you there.

03:38.528 --> 03:39.694
What are you guys talking
about? He's got me?

03:39.746 --> 03:41.029
There's no such thing
as too competitive.

03:41.081 --> 03:42.247
It's like you can't
let somebody be happy.

03:42.332 --> 03:43.499
You got to one-up
everybody all the time.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.050
You know, they got a name
for people like you?

03:45.135 --> 03:47.669
- You know what it is?
- I do, winners. They're called winners.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.422
Incorrect. Toppers.
You are a topper, my friend.

03:50.507 --> 03:53.842
What are
you doing?

03:55.061 --> 03:56.595
I'm sorry, did you
just... One dollar?

03:56.679 --> 03:57.596
You outbid me by one...

03:57.680 --> 03:58.831
He outbids me
by one dollar.

03:58.898 --> 04:00.265
What is this, <i>The</i>
<i>Price is Right?</i>

04:00.350 --> 04:01.233
Hey, did you bid on something?

04:01.317 --> 04:02.851
Hey, no, don't go there.

04:02.902 --> 04:05.020
Oh, your dress
is beautiful.

04:05.071 --> 04:06.688
- Where'd you get it?
- Thank you!

04:06.739 --> 04:08.774
Uh, I got it in this little shop
in Bangkok.

04:08.858 --> 04:11.777
Which is one of the perks
of being stationed overseas.

04:11.861 --> 04:13.562
- What about you, Chin?
- You bid on anything?

04:13.613 --> 04:15.397
Actually, yeah.
I'm about to win

04:15.448 --> 04:17.382
a ukulele lesson
from Jake Shimabukuro.

04:17.450 --> 04:20.886
- How cool is that?
- Cool,

04:20.954 --> 04:22.287
but you know what
would be even cooler, though,

04:22.372 --> 04:24.123
is if you bid on that romantic
getaway weekend to Kauai.

04:24.207 --> 04:25.874
Why is that coolest?

04:25.942 --> 04:28.744
Well, because
he's newly married,

04:28.812 --> 04:30.629
and Valentine's day
is this week.

04:30.713 --> 04:33.799
Unless you already got
Malia something?

04:33.883 --> 04:35.750
For your information,

04:35.802 --> 04:36.751
Malia's old school.

04:36.803 --> 04:37.853
She's perfectly happy

04:37.920 --> 04:39.104
with flowers and chocolates.

04:39.189 --> 04:40.755
Oh, okay, right.
Nothing says

04:40.807 --> 04:42.774
"I love you"
like drugstore candy.

04:42.859 --> 04:44.610
I forgot.

04:44.694 --> 04:47.613
It's better than someone
not remembering at all.

04:47.697 --> 04:50.165
What I'm hearing is, you're
actually okay with chocolates.

04:50.233 --> 04:51.233
Is that right?

04:51.284 --> 04:52.985
Hey, now I'm paranoid.

04:53.069 --> 04:54.987
I got to find something
for Gabby.

04:55.071 --> 04:56.605
Commander McGarrett...

04:56.656 --> 04:59.041
Weston, please.
Excuse me.

04:59.108 --> 05:01.126
Something wrong, sir?

05:01.211 --> 05:03.095
You could say that.

05:03.163 --> 05:05.547
Who is she?

05:05.615 --> 05:08.250
Don't know. The hotel maid only
found her about 20 minutes ago.

05:08.301 --> 05:10.636
I didn't see any ID
on her, no purse.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.771
And all floors have access
to the laundry chute?

05:12.839 --> 05:14.673
That's right. She
could have been dumped

05:14.757 --> 05:16.141
from any one of them.

05:16.226 --> 05:17.959
Okay, if she was a guest
at the fund-raiser,

05:18.011 --> 05:19.845
then we should recognize her,
right? Report her missing.

05:19.929 --> 05:21.313
Well, maybe not.

05:21.397 --> 05:22.948
We're not the only game
in town here tonight.

05:23.016 --> 05:24.349
What do you mean?

05:24.434 --> 05:25.634
There are two
wedding receptions

05:25.685 --> 05:26.985
in the hotel tonight,
along with the fundraiser.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.487
Way she's dressed,

05:28.571 --> 05:30.272
she could've been
at any of them.

05:30.323 --> 05:32.307
Okay, okay.
Listen to me.

05:32.358 --> 05:33.792
We need to shut this
entire hotel down.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.360
Nobody comes,
nobody goes,

05:35.445 --> 05:39.081
unless we see IDs and we get
statements, you understand?

05:39.148 --> 05:43.485
No. We're not causing a
scene like that tonight.

05:43.536 --> 05:45.204
I'm afraid we don't
have a choice, Governor.

05:45.288 --> 05:47.005
This entire hotel
is now a crime scene.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.007
Thank you, Commander,
I'm well aware of that.

05:49.092 --> 05:50.842
But I don't want the
Clean Coast Fund

05:50.927 --> 05:52.544
or any of the guests here
making national news tonight.

05:52.629 --> 05:56.014
So, until you
have all the facts,

05:56.099 --> 05:57.332
I want this
investigation treated

05:57.383 --> 05:59.601
with the utmost care
and discretion.

05:59.669 --> 06:00.969
Are we clear?

06:01.020 --> 06:04.690
Yeah.
Good.

06:04.774 --> 06:06.841
I want regular updates on this,

06:06.893 --> 06:08.843
every step of the way,
you understand?

06:08.895 --> 06:11.013
Of course, Governor.

06:21.324 --> 06:23.191
If I can't contain
a crime scene,

06:23.243 --> 06:24.626
then we've got
potential suspects

06:24.694 --> 06:25.577
walking out the front door.

06:25.662 --> 06:27.045
I hear you, but those suspects

06:27.130 --> 06:29.364
are some of the governor's
closest friends and supporters.

06:31.251 --> 06:35.537
Lori, I don't care, if you're
the Pope or the president,

06:35.588 --> 06:37.306
I want who did this.

06:41.103 --> 06:42.904
Code Blue to the ER,
Room 4.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.518
Somebody go ahead and start CPR.

06:54.569 --> 06:56.537
I need a ventilator.

06:56.604 --> 06:58.705
Pull a milligram
of epinephrine.

06:58.773 --> 06:59.990
Let's go ahead
and clear that airway.

07:00.057 --> 07:02.443
He's got a lot of
blood in his mouth.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.753
Hey, Max. All right,
here's the sample.

07:12.837 --> 07:14.455
Run it and see if
you can get a match.

07:14.539 --> 07:16.223
How'd you get this?

07:16.291 --> 07:17.128
I got it from the O.R.

07:17.129 --> 07:18.219
- You went into an operating room?
- Yeah.

07:18.220 --> 07:18.920
Unsterilized?

07:19.416 --> 07:21.417
I said ASAP, Max.

07:22.724 --> 07:24.166
All right,
so whoever did this,

07:24.167 --> 07:26.001
obviously wrapped this lady up
in towels

07:26.085 --> 07:28.286
and sheets and dumped her
through the chute.

07:28.337 --> 07:29.871
So Chin's grabbing gear
to process a laundry chute.

07:29.956 --> 07:31.473
Try to figure out which
floor she was dumped from.

07:31.541 --> 07:33.792
Nice tux, Max.

07:33.843 --> 07:35.794
What's the occasion?

07:35.845 --> 07:37.212
I was at the fund-raiser.

07:37.296 --> 07:39.631
Why did it take you
so long to get here?

07:39.682 --> 07:43.552
Well, if you must know,
I met someone,

07:43.636 --> 07:45.220
and we decided to leave
the event early

07:45.304 --> 07:46.521
so we could indulge

07:46.606 --> 07:48.657
in some late-night pancakes
at the Wailana Diner.

07:48.724 --> 07:50.392
Nice.

07:50.476 --> 07:55.030
As you can see, the victim
suffered blunt-force trauma

07:55.114 --> 07:56.498
to the back of the head.

07:56.566 --> 07:59.534
Judging by the laceration
and linear-type bruising,

07:59.619 --> 08:01.094
it would appear that
the victim was struck

08:01.119 --> 08:02.869
by a square-shaped object.

08:02.905 --> 08:04.372
Okay. Was that the COD?

08:04.457 --> 08:05.991
Difficult to say.

08:06.058 --> 08:08.059
She was hit over the head, but

08:08.127 --> 08:09.928
she also has light bruising
around the throat

08:09.996 --> 08:11.546
and petechial hemorrhaging,

08:11.631 --> 08:14.532
which would suggest that
the victim was also strangled.

08:14.584 --> 08:16.001
So, why do both?

08:16.052 --> 08:17.302
Well, it's quite possible
that the blow

08:17.369 --> 08:19.203
did not completely
incapacitate her.

08:19.255 --> 08:22.224
Uh, based on her broken
fingernails, which also seem

08:22.308 --> 08:23.675
that she fought back.

08:23.726 --> 08:26.978
With any luck, I might be able
to retrieve some trace evidence

08:27.046 --> 08:30.098
of blood or foreign DNA
from underneath them.

08:30.182 --> 08:33.201
Huh, looks like she was renting
the dress for the night.

08:33.269 --> 08:35.352
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

08:35.404 --> 08:37.355
That's when there's a fancy
party and it's a dress you want

08:37.405 --> 08:38.523
and it's out of your league.

08:38.573 --> 08:40.442
You buy it and you
return it the next day.

08:40.525 --> 08:41.543
That seems dishonest.

08:41.611 --> 08:43.495
And yet, perfectly legal.

08:43.562 --> 08:45.530
Well, in any case,
if her prints are on the system,

08:45.581 --> 08:48.083
maybe we can use this dress
to get an ID.

08:48.167 --> 08:49.534
In the mean time,
we need to look

08:49.585 --> 08:51.786
at the hotel
security footage.

08:51.871 --> 08:53.237
If we get eyes on our vic,

08:53.289 --> 08:55.040
maybe we can take
a look at the killer.

09:04.267 --> 09:07.519
Hey, anything?

09:07.586 --> 09:11.773
I just scoped the laundry chute
from the 20th floor to the 15th.

09:11.857 --> 09:13.308
So far, no signs of blood.

09:13.392 --> 09:16.037
Okay, so the vic had to
have been dumped below 14.

09:16.062 --> 09:17.262
Mm-hmm.

09:17.446 --> 09:21.099
Hey, for your information,
Malia really does like flowers.

09:21.150 --> 09:23.618
Yeah, I'm sure.

09:23.703 --> 09:27.122
Everyone knows Valentines Day is
for amateurs; Malia gets that.

09:27.206 --> 09:30.742
Okay, I'm just saying,
it doesn't hurt

09:30.793 --> 09:34.245
to make a little effort and
get a girl something nice.

09:34.297 --> 09:37.132
I need to go shopping, don't I?

09:37.216 --> 09:38.950
Yeah.

09:44.924 --> 09:48.643
I'm really sorry your weekend
with Catherine got derailed.

09:48.728 --> 09:50.628
That's fine,
I'll make it up to her.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.447
I'll take her to a
U-H football game or something.

09:52.515 --> 09:54.516
Oh, yeah?

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600
I'll give you a good price
on some tickets,

09:55.651 --> 09:59.521
seeing as I got
the, uh, last bid in.

10:00.773 --> 10:02.774
W-W-Wait, go back, go back.

10:02.825 --> 10:05.794
- That's our victim.
- That's her.

10:05.861 --> 10:07.662
Who's the guy? Date, maybe?

10:07.747 --> 10:09.030
Yeah, or somebody
she met tonight.

10:09.115 --> 10:09.981
Looks like he's had a couple.

10:10.032 --> 10:11.082
Pause it.

10:11.150 --> 10:12.267
What's he got in his hand?

10:12.335 --> 10:14.285
Keycard.

10:14.353 --> 10:16.304
Listen, do you have to,
uh, swipe the room key

10:16.372 --> 10:17.789
to go up in that elevator?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.040
Yeah, that's right.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.959
Can you access information off
of that card?

10:21.010 --> 10:23.345
Yeah, the hotel keeps a
digital log of every swipe.

10:23.429 --> 10:25.930
Let me access the elevator data.
Okay.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.384
We need a room number
and a name.

10:30.803 --> 10:32.170
Room 1121,

10:32.221 --> 10:33.855
part of a block of rooms
reserved for the

10:33.939 --> 10:35.390
Hawika wedding.

10:35.474 --> 10:38.727
Registered under Dennis Mack.

10:42.365 --> 10:44.366
Hold up.

10:47.870 --> 10:49.621
I got blood.

10:50.906 --> 10:52.741
Hey, me, too.

10:52.825 --> 10:54.492
Stairwell door.

11:25.241 --> 11:26.441
Dennis Mack?

11:26.525 --> 11:29.110
Oh, just get back!
All right, get back!

11:29.195 --> 11:30.228
Don't come any closer!

11:30.279 --> 11:31.229
Hey, listen, listen to me.

11:31.280 --> 11:31.946
Get back!

11:32.031 --> 11:34.199
Dennis? Hey.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.567
Dennis, I just want
to talk to you, man, all right?

11:36.619 --> 11:37.735
I'm not gonna hurt you.

11:37.787 --> 11:39.954
I am done talking.

11:40.039 --> 11:42.257
She's gone.

11:42.341 --> 11:43.425
She's gone,

11:43.509 --> 11:45.210
and she's never coming back.
Dennis,

11:45.261 --> 11:47.462
listen to me. Dennis!

11:47.546 --> 11:48.930
Listen. Listen to me.

11:49.014 --> 11:50.849
Hey, hey, listen to me.
Hey, hey. No, no, no!

11:59.099 --> 11:59.866
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

11:59.867 --> 12:02.119
Are you okay?
Yeah.

12:02.203 --> 12:04.454
I chipped a tooth,
cracked a couple of ribs.

12:04.539 --> 12:06.757
Yeah, fine. Tell me
you got the sample.

12:06.841 --> 12:08.959
Max has it.
We're running the match now.

12:09.043 --> 12:11.461
All right. Without it,
we got nothing.

12:11.546 --> 12:14.564
You understand that, right?
How about Chin? Chin get out?

12:14.632 --> 12:15.932
No.

12:16.017 --> 12:17.467
Excuse me.
All right.

12:17.552 --> 12:18.735
Governor's here.

12:18.803 --> 12:21.988
Go. Go, go, go,
go, go. I got this.

12:25.276 --> 12:26.893
Just the man I was looking for.

12:26.944 --> 12:28.228
Sir,

12:28.279 --> 12:31.231
I take full responsibility for
the actions of my team today.

12:31.299 --> 12:33.533
And by "actions" you mean
the international incident

12:33.601 --> 12:35.152
you just dropped in my lap?

12:40.107 --> 12:41.808
Let me take this
from the beginning.

12:41.876 --> 12:45.295
I just want
to talk, Dennis, okay?

12:45.379 --> 12:47.414
I am done talking.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.666
She's gone.

12:49.750 --> 12:50.834
She's gone,

12:50.918 --> 12:52.452
and she's never coming back.
Dennis,

12:52.503 --> 12:54.454
listen to me. Dennis,
listen. Listen to me.

12:54.505 --> 12:56.923
Hey, hey, no, no, no!

12:56.974 --> 12:58.642
Hey, Steve! Steve!

13:07.568 --> 13:10.270
I leave you alone
for two seconds...

13:10.321 --> 13:12.989
<i>Hey, I asked you</i>
<i>a question, Dennis.</i>

13:13.074 --> 13:14.157
Why'd you do it?

13:14.242 --> 13:15.575
I didn't do anything,
all right?!

13:15.643 --> 13:17.527
April did this to me.

13:17.595 --> 13:20.313
I mean, I caught her
with a groomsman.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.284
You know... a groomsman.

13:25.786 --> 13:27.287
Such a cliché.

13:27.338 --> 13:30.841
Okay, um, so, um,

13:30.925 --> 13:33.593
you killed her because
she was cheating on you?

13:33.661 --> 13:35.095
Wait. What are you...?

13:35.162 --> 13:37.714
What do you mean,
"killed her?"

13:37.798 --> 13:40.350
What are you... what
are you talking about?

13:40.434 --> 13:42.219
Are you saying
that April's dead?

13:44.972 --> 13:46.139
Hey, sober up

13:46.190 --> 13:47.557
and look hard, Dennis.

13:47.642 --> 13:49.559
Hey, look at the photo
right here!

13:49.644 --> 13:51.344
What? What?

13:51.395 --> 13:54.331
Look at this.
Is this woman April? Hey!

13:54.398 --> 13:55.665
Is this... is
this April?

13:55.733 --> 13:57.517
No.

13:57.568 --> 13:59.736
No, that's not her.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.488
Oh, uh, wait
a minute.

14:01.539 --> 14:02.706
Does that mean April's alive?

14:02.790 --> 14:04.040
Listen to me.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.842
Just focus on this picture
right now.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.360
Okay, because
you're the last person

14:07.411 --> 14:09.045
to see this woman here alive.

14:09.130 --> 14:10.580
Who is that?

14:12.149 --> 14:13.667
Uh, wait a second.

14:13.718 --> 14:15.635
Um...

14:15.703 --> 14:17.721
This is the-the chick
from the elevator.

14:17.805 --> 14:19.256
But listen, I-I
swear, all she did

14:19.340 --> 14:21.007
was help me get
back to my room.

14:21.058 --> 14:22.309
The room with the blood

14:22.376 --> 14:24.561
and the clothes torn up,
thrown all over the place.

14:24.645 --> 14:25.729
Those were April's

14:25.813 --> 14:27.731
clothes, okay?

14:27.815 --> 14:29.482
I...

14:29.550 --> 14:31.818
Look, man, I lost it.

14:31.885 --> 14:33.186
I punched the mirror

14:33.237 --> 14:35.221
because I couldn't stand
to look at myself.

14:35.273 --> 14:37.056
That's how you feel
after you see

14:37.108 --> 14:40.026
your girlfriend
banging some other dude.

14:41.279 --> 14:43.113
Anyway, that's why

14:43.197 --> 14:44.447
I went up to the roof.

14:44.532 --> 14:45.832
The woman from the elevator--

14:45.899 --> 14:48.001
where'd you meet her?
You meet her at the wedding?

14:48.068 --> 14:50.954
No. I met her in the... lobby.

14:51.038 --> 14:52.956
Um... I was wasted.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.759
You know, trying to get back
up in my room, and-and...

14:57.295 --> 14:58.795
...she said she forgot her key.

14:58.879 --> 15:00.246
She say anything else?

15:00.298 --> 15:02.182
No, she was on the
phone with someone,

15:02.249 --> 15:05.385
uh, while she was helping me
to the elevator.

15:05.436 --> 15:07.520
Someone she was going to meet.

15:07.588 --> 15:10.640
Meet, uh, where? On your floor?
No.

15:10.725 --> 15:11.924
No, I don't think so.

15:11.976 --> 15:14.811
I mean, the only reason
she got off was to make sure

15:14.895 --> 15:17.314
I made it to my room okay,
you know.

15:17.398 --> 15:19.950
She was nice.

15:20.034 --> 15:22.786
Okay.

15:22.870 --> 15:25.905
Okay, I, uh, I think that
either Jane Doe used this guy

15:25.957 --> 15:27.707
to get up to a higher floor...

15:27.775 --> 15:30.210
Yeah, question is, who
was she going up to see?

15:31.545 --> 15:32.879
Hey.

15:32.946 --> 15:35.131
Hey. Uh, did you get an ID on our vic?
No. Her prints

15:35.216 --> 15:36.916
weren't in the system,
but Chin and Kono found blood

15:36.968 --> 15:38.385
in the laundry chute
on the twelfth floor.

15:38.452 --> 15:40.620
Okay, have HPD do
a room-to-room search,

15:40.671 --> 15:42.138
and give me a body count

15:42.223 --> 15:43.956
of everyone booked in
on that floor.

15:49.513 --> 15:50.963
Five-O! Open up!
- Hold up.

15:51.015 --> 15:52.649
I got the master key
from security.

15:52.733 --> 15:54.067
Whose room is this?

15:54.134 --> 15:56.486
It's reserved by a company
called Garlin International.

15:56.570 --> 15:59.572
It's one of six rooms
they booked on the floor.

16:01.108 --> 16:02.909
Yeah.
All right.

16:02.976 --> 16:05.078
A lot of companies held rooms
for the fund-raiser,

16:05.145 --> 16:06.446
but wound up not
using them.

16:06.497 --> 16:09.416
Happens all the time when
hotels host events like this.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.252
All right, this room
looks completely clean.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.537
No signs of a struggle.

16:14.622 --> 16:17.090
No. You smell that?

16:17.157 --> 16:18.625
Yeah, bleach.

16:21.629 --> 16:23.496
No towels.

16:23.564 --> 16:25.715
No sheets, either.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.001
You know what else is missing?

16:29.053 --> 16:31.388
Every room I've searched had
this square glass vase

16:31.472 --> 16:33.390
right on this table.
Max said our victim was hit

16:33.474 --> 16:35.392
in the head with something
that had a square edge.

16:35.476 --> 16:36.393
Killer must have dumped it.

16:36.477 --> 16:38.078
Signs are obvious.
Someone killed

16:38.145 --> 16:40.030
our victim in this room
and tried to cover it up.

16:40.114 --> 16:41.648
All right, let's have HPD
process this entire room

16:41.699 --> 16:43.616
top to bottom, and see
if we can get any prints

16:43.684 --> 16:44.951
or any
trace evidence.

16:45.018 --> 16:46.319
I'll get on the phone
with Garlin International,

16:46.370 --> 16:47.537
find out who stayed here.

16:56.313 --> 16:57.964
Look at this.

16:58.031 --> 16:59.249
It's like a month's pay.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.867
Uh, can I have your salary?

17:00.918 --> 17:03.253
'Cause that's like
two months pay for me.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.753
Hi.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.306
May I help you?
Yeah, we were wondering

17:06.373 --> 17:07.874
if you could help us
with an investigation.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.291
Do you recognize

17:09.359 --> 17:10.894
this woman?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.147
That's one of my dresses.
Can you

17:15.214 --> 17:16.148
scan this tag and tell us

17:16.215 --> 17:17.067
if she paid with cash

17:17.151 --> 17:18.384
or a credit card?

17:20.988 --> 17:22.321
Yes, here it is.

17:22.388 --> 17:24.523
It was bought with
a credit card.

17:24.575 --> 17:26.492
Woman's name was
Victoria Chase.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.194
Okay, great. Um,

17:28.244 --> 17:30.613
could you print that out, give
us a record of the transaction?

17:30.698 --> 17:32.659
I'll track down the address
and call McGarrett.

17:32.684 --> 17:33.700
All right.

17:33.701 --> 17:35.418
I have the guest lists
from all the events

17:35.503 --> 17:36.586
at the hotel, and yeah,

17:36.670 --> 17:38.121
looks like
there was a Victoria Chase

17:38.205 --> 17:39.506
at the governor's fund-raiser.

17:42.343 --> 17:45.211
<i>The vic lived here?</i>

17:45.262 --> 17:46.463
Yeah, well, according
to the credit card info,

17:46.547 --> 17:47.630
this is where the bills went.

17:47.715 --> 17:49.632
Well, don't you
think it's odd

17:49.683 --> 17:51.968
that somebody who can afford
a $5,000 charity dinner

17:52.052 --> 17:53.186
and lives in a
place like this?

17:53.253 --> 17:54.471
Yeah. Though
I don't think she's local,

17:54.555 --> 17:55.805
'cause there's no record
of a Hawaiian

17:55.890 --> 17:57.423
driver's license with the DMV.

18:04.398 --> 18:06.232
Hey.

18:06.283 --> 18:07.734
Oh, can I help you?

18:07.785 --> 18:10.620
Ma'am, I'm Steve McGarrett,
this is Officer Kalakaua.

18:10.704 --> 18:12.789
We're with Five-O. Ma'am,
I'm sorry to bother you,

18:12.873 --> 18:15.959
but, um, do you happen
to know a Victoria Chase?

18:16.043 --> 18:17.961
What happened?

18:18.045 --> 18:20.947
What happened to Vicky?

18:23.250 --> 18:26.619
I knew
that something was wrong

18:26.670 --> 18:28.287
when she didn't...

18:28.339 --> 18:30.340
when she didn't
come home last night.

18:32.292 --> 18:34.344
I just... I can't..,

18:34.428 --> 18:36.596
I can't...
I can't believe she's gone.

18:39.132 --> 18:42.819
We're very sorry
for your loss.

18:42.903 --> 18:45.355
Amanda, how long had

18:45.439 --> 18:47.440
your sister been living with you?
She, uh...

18:47.491 --> 18:49.742
She came down from Chicago

18:49.810 --> 18:53.112
about a year ago
to help with the baby.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.833
Big sis.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.868
Always looking out
for me, you know?

18:58.953 --> 19:00.203
She say anything to you

19:00.287 --> 19:03.039
about the fund-raiser
last night that she went to?

19:03.123 --> 19:06.793
Or that she was, um,
going to meet anybody?

19:06.844 --> 19:08.294
I didn't know she was going.

19:08.345 --> 19:10.029
I thought
she was working last night.

19:10.097 --> 19:11.297
Where did she work?

19:11.348 --> 19:12.715
She waited tables

19:12.800 --> 19:14.050
at O'Donnell's.

19:14.134 --> 19:15.718
Basically lived on tips.

19:15.803 --> 19:19.472
Amanda, the charity
dinner was $5,000 a plate.

19:19.523 --> 19:22.525
Do you know where she would have
gotten that kind of money?

19:22.610 --> 19:25.612
She told me she was saving
that money for a car.

19:25.679 --> 19:28.865
A charity dinner. I...

19:28.949 --> 19:30.950
I don't know.

19:31.952 --> 19:33.570
It doesn't make sense.

19:33.654 --> 19:35.705
Why would she hide that
from you?

19:35.789 --> 19:36.906
I don't know.

19:36.991 --> 19:39.242
We were close.

19:39.326 --> 19:42.245
You know, we could tell
each other anything.

19:42.329 --> 19:44.631
Our parents died

19:44.698 --> 19:47.333
when we were teenagers and...

19:49.720 --> 19:51.905
...Vicky basically
raised me herself.

19:51.972 --> 19:53.573
Just us

19:53.641 --> 19:55.675
against the world, you know.

19:55.726 --> 19:58.578
Amanda, did Vicky
have any, uh,

19:58.646 --> 20:01.231
jealous boyfriends or enemies?

20:01.315 --> 20:04.267
Anyone who would want
to hurt her?

20:04.351 --> 20:08.321
Honestly, I-I can't
think of a single person.

20:10.357 --> 20:12.358
But whoever did this--

20:12.409 --> 20:16.863
I want them caught,
and I want them punished.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.168
<i>Okay, I'm thinking,</i>
<i>this could just be</i>

20:22.235 --> 20:23.586
a Cinderella story gone bad.

20:23.671 --> 20:25.755
Nice lady, she saves up
to buy a ticket to the ball,

20:25.839 --> 20:27.290
she gets herself
a fancy dress.

20:27.374 --> 20:29.208
Right? And she is looking
for Prince Charming.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.427
Okay, are you saying Vicky
went looking for a husband?

20:31.512 --> 20:32.795
Maybe not a husband,
but, uh,

20:32.880 --> 20:34.464
take it from me, because I know.

20:34.548 --> 20:36.349
Nobody wants to be alone
on Valentine's Day.

20:36.416 --> 20:38.184
I know, but talking
to her sister,

20:38.251 --> 20:40.103
Vicky just didn't seem
like the type.

20:40.187 --> 20:41.771
What about this company
that booked the room,

20:41.855 --> 20:43.389
Garlin International--
what do we know about them?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.275
Well, they are
an international exporter

20:45.359 --> 20:46.976
of transportation equipment

20:47.061 --> 20:48.227
to the Pacific Rim.

20:48.279 --> 20:49.646
Not exactly sexy stuff,

20:49.730 --> 20:51.948
but they do $200
million worth of business

20:52.032 --> 20:54.817
in Asia through
a satellite office on O'ahu.

20:54.902 --> 20:57.153
And also, according
to the guest list,

20:57.237 --> 20:58.988
Garlin bought a whole table
at the fund-raiser.

20:59.073 --> 21:01.324
So, maybe Vicky was going up to
meet someone she met that night?

21:01.408 --> 21:02.408
An executive

21:02.459 --> 21:03.559
from the company?

21:03.627 --> 21:04.744
Yeah, see, that
would make sense.

21:04.795 --> 21:05.912
Except Garlin claims
that no one

21:05.963 --> 21:07.130
from the company
actually attended

21:07.214 --> 21:09.415
the fund-raiser. They gave
the tickets away to clients.

21:09.466 --> 21:11.150
I don't care what they
were claiming. Somebody was

21:11.218 --> 21:12.524
staying in those rooms.
We need their names.

21:12.525 --> 21:14.836
Problem is that Garlin's corporate
headquarters are in New York City.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.751
They're playing phone tag
with us, and blaming it

21:16.753 --> 21:18.556
on the time difference.
Look, there has got to be

21:18.559 --> 21:19.926
a connection
between Vicky Chase

21:19.977 --> 21:21.594
and this company,
Garlin International.

21:21.645 --> 21:23.079
She went up to that room
for a reason.

21:23.147 --> 21:25.982
Hey. So, HPD pulled a print

21:26.050 --> 21:27.533
off the door handle
of our crime scene.

21:27.601 --> 21:30.069
Ex-con named Roger Furman.

21:30.137 --> 21:31.521
He did time for aggravated
assault and battery.

21:31.605 --> 21:33.589
He now works as a bouncer
at O'Donnell's.

21:33.657 --> 21:35.575
That's where Vicky worked.

21:35.642 --> 21:36.976
Not only that.
I looked at her phone records.

21:37.044 --> 21:39.278
Guess who she called ten minutes
before she got on that elevator?

21:39.330 --> 21:41.364
Furman.

21:47.621 --> 21:49.622
He's headed for the woods!

21:59.933 --> 22:01.551
♪

22:24.458 --> 22:25.524
Hey!

22:25.576 --> 22:26.993
That hurts, man.

22:27.044 --> 22:28.344
"That hurts"?

22:28.412 --> 22:30.463
You just jumped out of a window,
and this hurts? Yeah.

22:30.530 --> 22:32.081
Hey, Danny, that was
an impressive tackle.

22:32.166 --> 22:34.634
Like what they do it at U-H.

22:35.886 --> 22:37.303
Those tickets are mine, Steve.

22:37.370 --> 22:38.354
Get up.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.030
You'd better be
right about this, Commander.

22:55.991 --> 22:57.074
How you doing?

22:57.125 --> 22:58.942
Good, yeah, good.

22:58.994 --> 23:02.446
The governor just,
uh, shut down Five-O,

23:02.497 --> 23:03.497
but I'm all right.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.466
What did you tell him?

23:05.550 --> 23:06.300
Everything.

23:06.384 --> 23:07.418
Okay, you see, that was

23:07.469 --> 23:08.969
your first mistake,
you understand?

23:09.054 --> 23:10.460
All right, on top of being
too competitive,

23:10.485 --> 23:11.928
you're also too honest.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.758
Look, we screwed up
this time, Danny, okay?

23:14.809 --> 23:17.611
It's my fault; we went too far.
Oh.

23:17.679 --> 23:19.647
Okay, this is your...
your pity party.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.181
Is it a personal invite only

23:21.266 --> 23:22.516
or can anybody else attend?

23:22.601 --> 23:23.784
Can I come, too?

23:23.852 --> 23:25.069
It's nobody's fault.

23:25.136 --> 23:26.120
We did what we had
to do, that's it.

23:26.276 --> 23:28.411
I know. I just hope Max gets
that blood work done

23:28.672 --> 23:29.972
and pulls a match.

23:30.308 --> 23:32.359
If he doesn't, we're
never gonna see Chin again.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.446
So, what, uh, what was it, huh?

23:35.497 --> 23:36.480
You were jealous?

23:36.531 --> 23:37.781
Man, jealous of what?

23:37.832 --> 23:39.033
Of Vicky trading up.

23:39.117 --> 23:40.551
Finding someone better than you.
What'd she do?

23:40.619 --> 23:41.952
She call you up
and tell you to beat it?

23:42.003 --> 23:44.154
I knew I should've
never gotten involved.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.306
Lesson learned.

23:45.373 --> 23:47.157
Good Samaritan always

23:47.208 --> 23:48.475
gets screwed, doesn't he?

23:48.543 --> 23:49.677
"Good Samaritan," is that you?

23:49.761 --> 23:50.794
You the Good Samaritan?

23:50.845 --> 23:51.962
What are you talking about?

23:52.013 --> 23:53.314
Vicky was a sweetheart, dude.

23:53.381 --> 23:54.515
Hey,

23:54.599 --> 23:56.100
whenever I was working the door,

23:56.167 --> 23:57.785
she was constantly
bringing me drinks,

23:57.852 --> 23:59.019
taking care of my friends.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.220
She was down like that.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.224
So she comes to me, like,
maybe three months ago,

24:04.309 --> 24:05.359
and she's mad.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.827
Mad like I never seen.

24:06.895 --> 24:08.362
And she straight-up
asks me if I'd lay

24:08.446 --> 24:10.514
the beat-down on
somebody for her.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.866
I told her, "Sure."

24:12.951 --> 24:14.902
Lay a beat-down on who?
I don't know who.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.905
She just told me when it
was time, she'd called me.

24:17.989 --> 24:19.373
Okay, and that call
came last night?

24:19.457 --> 24:22.042
She asked me if I would
meet her down at the hotel.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.011
Dude was staying in room 1215.
Okay,

24:24.079 --> 24:25.462
but she went upstairs
without you. How come?

24:25.530 --> 24:26.530
Man, when that call came in,

24:26.581 --> 24:27.965
I was way on the North Shore.

24:28.032 --> 24:29.833
I was in Haleiwa.

24:29.884 --> 24:31.885
But I told Vicky,
I said, "just wait for me

24:31.970 --> 24:33.203
"in the hotel lobby.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.005
Might take me awhile,
hey, but I'll be there."

24:35.056 --> 24:36.423
But by the time I got there,

24:36.508 --> 24:38.559
she was gone.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.927
So then you just went
upstairs to look for her.

24:40.011 --> 24:40.711
Yeah, man.

24:40.762 --> 24:41.845
I knew something was up.

24:41.896 --> 24:43.213
So I jammed up to the room.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.231
I even checked the door.

24:44.315 --> 24:46.016
Hey, but the door
was locked.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.067
I left.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.435
And that's it.
That's not it.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.937
You ran from us;
why'd you run from us?

24:50.021 --> 24:51.021
I'm a two-striker, man.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.439
I got a house full
of hunting rifles.

24:52.524 --> 24:53.741
I knew damn well sure I was

24:53.825 --> 24:54.942
gonna be going
down for something.

24:55.026 --> 24:57.027
All right.

24:57.078 --> 25:00.614
Vicky, did she say
who the guy was, what he did

25:00.699 --> 25:02.449
to piss her off,
why she wanted you

25:02.534 --> 25:03.450
to beat his ass?

25:03.535 --> 25:04.752
Did she say what his name was?

25:04.836 --> 25:06.587
No, you know, she did
mention something.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.455
She mentioned that this guy
had messed with her sister.

25:08.540 --> 25:09.923
Amanda?

25:10.008 --> 25:11.458
Yeah, Amanda.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.395
<i>We believe your sister</i>

25:14.462 --> 25:17.064
went up to a room
to confront someone.

25:17.132 --> 25:18.899
Someone who may
have hurt you.

25:18.967 --> 25:20.611
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

25:20.636 --> 25:21.836
No.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.871
I don't.

25:23.938 --> 25:25.606
Amanda, the room was booked

25:25.690 --> 25:27.474
by a company called
Garlin International.

25:27.559 --> 25:30.694
You know anyone
who works there?

25:30.762 --> 25:32.579
Oh, my God.

25:32.647 --> 25:35.416
This-this is my fault.

25:35.483 --> 25:37.618
Oh, my... I think
I'm going to be sick.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.488
Amanda, slow down, it's okay.

25:42.574 --> 25:43.657
Why don't you just

25:43.742 --> 25:45.709
tell us what happened.

25:46.961 --> 25:48.245
Who works at Garlin?

25:48.296 --> 25:51.048
I did...

25:51.115 --> 25:55.002
but I quit over a year ago.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.303
Why did you quit?

25:59.591 --> 26:02.626
I was just a researcher.

26:02.677 --> 26:04.978
But there was...

26:05.063 --> 26:08.649
There was this executive.

26:08.733 --> 26:12.369
He used to fly in
from New York.

26:12.437 --> 26:14.971
He was...

26:15.023 --> 26:18.826
sophisticated and charming.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.829
He-he spoke Italian

26:21.913 --> 26:25.032
and French and Russian.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.984
I was, uh...

26:28.036 --> 26:30.337
impressed.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.991
So I went out with
him a few times.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.629
But, um...

26:38.680 --> 26:40.597
This one... this one night,

26:40.665 --> 26:43.300
in his hotel room,

26:43.351 --> 26:46.286
I-I found a-a ring
by the bathroom sink.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.771
And you didn't know
he was married.

26:47.839 --> 26:49.439
Not only was he
married, his...

26:49.507 --> 26:53.026
wife was the CEO's daughter.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.450
When I... I found the ring,

27:00.518 --> 27:03.003
I tried to leave.

27:04.038 --> 27:07.040
He wouldn't let me.

27:08.459 --> 27:10.460
He forced himself on me.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.749
So, the baby...

27:21.089 --> 27:22.673
When Vicky found out,

27:22.724 --> 27:24.207
she was...

27:24.259 --> 27:26.176
She wanted me to go
to the police.

27:26.227 --> 27:30.013
She was... so angry.

27:30.064 --> 27:32.048
But the humiliation

27:32.100 --> 27:33.834
and the agony-- I just...

27:33.902 --> 27:36.220
Couldn't go through with it.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.405
No.

27:38.489 --> 27:40.657
Vicky...

27:40.725 --> 27:42.726
she just...

27:42.777 --> 27:45.779
She couldn't let it go.

27:45.864 --> 27:49.399
She couldn't let it go.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.825
I'm really sorry to put
you through all this.

27:58.893 --> 28:01.094
But you said to me

28:01.179 --> 28:03.914
that, um...

28:03.965 --> 28:06.533
That you wanted me to punish
the man who did this?

28:06.601 --> 28:09.252
You remember that?

28:09.304 --> 28:11.355
And I want to do that.

28:11.422 --> 28:15.275
You got to give me a name.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.312
Dmitri.

28:19.697 --> 28:22.382
His name is Dmitri Vonakov.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.785
Dmitri Vonakov is M.I.A.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.387
I checked all the hotels,
Garlin's local offices, nothing.

28:27.455 --> 28:28.572
According to TSA,

28:28.623 --> 28:29.606
he flew in on Garlin's
private plane

28:29.657 --> 28:30.624
two days ago.

28:30.692 --> 28:31.658
The plane's still here.

28:31.743 --> 28:32.876
Yeah, and there's
no record of him

28:32.944 --> 28:34.211
leaving by boat
or commercial airline.

28:34.278 --> 28:36.380
People don't just disappear;
I mean, he's got

28:36.447 --> 28:37.631
to be here somewhere, right?

28:37.715 --> 28:39.583
So, I just talked to
the valets at the hotel.

28:39.634 --> 28:42.069
A town car with diplomatic
plates came to pick up

28:42.136 --> 28:44.638
a guest meeting Vonakov's
description at 10:15 last night.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.573
That's right around the time
our vic was discovered.

28:46.641 --> 28:47.724
Okay, hang on,
diplomatic plates?

28:47.792 --> 28:49.059
Headed where?
The valets don't know,

28:49.126 --> 28:51.345
but the first three letters
of the plate were D-Y-R.

28:51.429 --> 28:52.646
So, D is for
diplomat, and Y-R

28:52.730 --> 28:53.597
is the State
Department's

28:53.648 --> 28:54.481
code for Russia.

28:54.565 --> 28:55.682
Russia, right?
Okay, hold on.

28:58.102 --> 28:59.453
So, Vonakov was born

28:59.520 --> 29:01.488
in Moscow;
he's a Russian citizen.

29:01.572 --> 29:04.324
He's hiding
at the Russian Consulate.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.120
<i>You must be mistaken.</i>

29:17.171 --> 29:20.374
I've known Dmitri Vonakov
for over 20 years,

29:20.458 --> 29:21.541
since we attended university.

29:21.626 --> 29:22.592
He is no murderer.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.894
Technically,
Consul Shepkin,

29:23.962 --> 29:26.229
he's a murderer and a rapist.

29:26.297 --> 29:28.131
And you have proof of all this?
Aside

29:28.182 --> 29:29.967
from the sworn statement
of the woman he raped?

29:30.018 --> 29:31.935
Dmitri is a wealthy man.

29:32.003 --> 29:33.787
Women target him all the time.
Listen, no offense,

29:33.855 --> 29:35.155
but I'm done wasting time.

29:35.223 --> 29:36.773
So, why don't you
bring Vonakov out here.

29:36.841 --> 29:38.992
We'll take a blood sample,
and then we'll go.

29:39.060 --> 29:41.194
I don't understand.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.029
You don't?

29:42.113 --> 29:43.613
Okay, uh, you see,

29:43.681 --> 29:45.565
our victim, she has blood

29:45.650 --> 29:46.900
under her fingernails.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.169
Now, if your buddy is
innocent like you say he is,

29:49.237 --> 29:50.704
have him come out here,
we'll take a sample,

29:50.788 --> 29:52.906
and then we will clear
his name once and for all,

29:52.991 --> 29:54.191
and then we move on.

29:55.209 --> 29:58.679
So, you think
that Dmitri is here?

29:58.746 --> 30:00.163
Oh, one of your cars
picked him up

30:00.214 --> 30:02.182
from the hotel last night,
so, yeah, we know he's here.

30:02.250 --> 30:05.469
Well, it's true that he does
stay at the consulate

30:05.536 --> 30:07.170
when he's in town on business

30:07.221 --> 30:08.255
from time to time,

30:08.339 --> 30:09.873
but that was last night.

30:09.924 --> 30:11.174
He's gone now.

30:11.225 --> 30:12.926
Gone where?

30:13.011 --> 30:15.062
I'm his friend,
not his babysitter.

30:16.514 --> 30:17.214
You're a bad liar.

30:18.182 --> 30:19.349
He's here.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.851
We're gonna search
every inch of this place

30:20.902 --> 30:21.918
until we find him.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.606
In Hawaii...

30:27.859 --> 30:29.710
...this is Russian soil.

30:29.777 --> 30:31.111
How can you defend
a guy like that?

30:31.195 --> 30:33.063
He just raped a woman,
and he killed her sister.

30:33.114 --> 30:35.115
We're done, gentlemen.

30:38.202 --> 30:40.220
Since when do you
speak Russian?

30:40.288 --> 30:43.290
Oh, I, uh, I worked a Russian
mob case in Brighton Beach.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.408
All I learned how to say was,
"Back off, we're cops,"

30:45.460 --> 30:47.577
and "this vodka tastes like urine."
Huh.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.232
He's in there.

30:52.300 --> 30:54.534
Now, listen to me,
even if we can prove that,

30:54.602 --> 30:56.403
we will never get
a blood sample.

30:56.471 --> 30:58.905
As long as Vonakov's in there,
we can't touch him.

30:58.973 --> 31:00.741
Okay,

31:00.808 --> 31:02.809
so we drag his ass out.

31:06.676 --> 31:07.626
Governor Denning.

31:07.711 --> 31:09.411
Good to see you again.

31:09.462 --> 31:11.063
I'm sorry it's not
under better circumstances.

31:11.131 --> 31:13.215
Consul Shepkin,

31:13.854 --> 31:15.906
you have my apologies
for the actions

31:15.990 --> 31:17.307
of my Five-O task force today.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.675
I saw some

31:18.743 --> 31:20.160
of the damage on the way in.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.195
The damage is done.

31:22.246 --> 31:23.914
All I ask is
that justice be served.

31:23.998 --> 31:24.998
It will be.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.667
I'll assure you of that.

31:27.718 --> 31:30.187
I'd like to see Lieutenant
Kelly now, please.

31:30.254 --> 31:32.222
Of course, this way.

31:41.732 --> 31:43.049
Sir...

31:43.101 --> 31:46.019
I don't know what he told you,
but let me explain.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.355
Thanks.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.739
I've had enough
of that today.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.242
You see, over the
last two hours,

31:52.326 --> 31:54.778
I've had to explain your actions
to two senators,

31:54.862 --> 31:57.948
the attorney general, the
American ambassador to Russia.

31:58.032 --> 31:59.749
They were harboring
a murderer and rapist.

31:59.834 --> 32:00.784
Dmitri Vonakov
is innocent

32:00.868 --> 32:02.953
until proven guilty.

32:03.037 --> 32:04.254
The consul is right.

32:04.338 --> 32:05.789
And if I were you, Lieutenant,

32:05.873 --> 32:08.425
I'd be more concerned
with the charges you happen

32:08.509 --> 32:09.576
to be facing,

32:09.627 --> 32:12.212
like trespassing,
destruction of property,

32:12.263 --> 32:14.598
assault and battery,
espionage, oh,

32:14.682 --> 32:16.299
and let's not forget

32:16.384 --> 32:20.187
bringing a radiological
weapon onto Russian soil.

32:21.889 --> 32:24.307
This is nothing short
of an act of terrorism.

32:24.392 --> 32:26.309
And my government insists
that the lieutenant

32:26.394 --> 32:29.095
be appropriately punished.

32:29.147 --> 32:31.114
Weston, this better be good.

32:32.766 --> 32:34.317
Hey, cuz, you in position?

32:34.402 --> 32:35.569
Yeah.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.454
All right, we're good
to go when you are.

32:38.656 --> 32:40.457
Hey, FYI, I just got a text.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.459
You won those ukulele lessons
at the auction.

32:42.543 --> 32:43.493
Cool.

32:43.578 --> 32:46.546
Give them to Malia for me.

33:12.607 --> 33:14.140
Stop! Hands in the air!

33:17.662 --> 33:19.462
What is this? What happened?

33:19.530 --> 33:21.414
They got Chin.

33:21.482 --> 33:23.216
He didn't make it to the exit.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.419
Sir!

33:32.210 --> 33:35.712
Evacuate the grounds now. Now!

33:38.432 --> 33:41.351
Security was tighter
than we thought.

33:41.435 --> 33:43.303
They were right
on top of him.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.688
Wait, wait.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.693
- Look, it worked.
- They're evacuating.

33:52.063 --> 33:53.580
It's Vonakov.

33:53.648 --> 33:55.115
Okay. All right.

33:55.182 --> 33:56.333
Guys, we've got him!

33:56.400 --> 33:57.867
They're in a town car
headed out the gate.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.202
We have diplomatic plates.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.771
It is Delta, Yankee, Romeo,
zero, zero, niner.

34:12.032 --> 34:13.583
Hey!

34:13.668 --> 34:14.717
Hands up, driver.

34:14.802 --> 34:16.969
Hands where I could see 'em.

34:17.036 --> 34:20.889
I'm on a diplomatic mission
from the Russian government.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.509
You cannot stop this car.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.810
Okay. We know Vonakov's
in the car.

34:23.877 --> 34:25.061
So you either hand him
over to us,

34:25.146 --> 34:26.429
or we come in there,
and we take him, all right?

34:26.514 --> 34:27.429
It's your choice.

34:27.514 --> 34:28.431
You cannot search this car.

34:28.516 --> 34:29.849
Get out of the car, Vonakov!

34:29.900 --> 34:31.150
Come on!
Turn around.

34:31.217 --> 34:33.152
Hey, driver, hands up!

34:33.219 --> 34:35.054
I'm not done with this.
Vonakov!

34:35.940 --> 34:37.373
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

34:37.491 --> 34:38.056
I got him!

34:51.371 --> 34:53.623
Steve?

34:53.690 --> 34:54.907
Steve?!

34:56.177 --> 34:57.777
Open your eyes.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.179
Come on.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.190
Vonakov-- is he dead?

35:10.257 --> 35:12.409
- No. EMTs say he's gonna make it.
- You all right?

35:12.476 --> 35:17.380
Yeah. We gotta get a blood
sample from Vonakov now,

35:17.448 --> 35:19.616
while he's not protected,
you understand?

35:19.700 --> 35:22.452
Get it over to Max, prove
that he killed Vicky Chase.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.453
All right. I'm on it.

35:23.537 --> 35:24.788
Okay. All right.
I'll call Max

35:24.872 --> 35:26.239
and let him know it's
on its way, all right?

35:26.290 --> 35:27.957
Okay, Danny. Good.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.046
"The utmost discretion."

35:33.113 --> 35:35.765
The governor's
gonna love this one.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.217
Don't worry about that.

35:37.284 --> 35:38.935
I'll take care of the governor.

35:39.003 --> 35:42.789
Sorry, miss, but I need you
to step outside.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.457
Okay.

35:58.305 --> 35:59.989
Code Blue to the ER,
Room 4.

36:07.782 --> 36:10.533
Thank you, Weston.

36:10.618 --> 36:13.920
Um, I expect a full
debriefing later this afternoon.

36:13.987 --> 36:15.205
Understood?

36:15.289 --> 36:17.440
Good.

36:18.542 --> 36:23.830
Well... I'm sorry,
Consul Shepkin.

36:23.881 --> 36:28.385
I'm afraid this has been...
a terrible misunderstanding.

36:28.469 --> 36:30.587
A misunderstanding?

36:30.654 --> 36:34.924
Yes. Apparently, the barrels
in Lieutenant Kelly's van

36:34.992 --> 36:37.343
are empty and
completely harmless.

36:37.395 --> 36:40.513
They were seized at a raid
earlier this morning at the docks.

36:40.564 --> 36:44.100
Why... why didn't you just tell
me this before, Lieutenant?

36:44.168 --> 36:46.903
I thought it best
to keep my mouth shut,

36:46.987 --> 36:49.739
let the lawyers
work it out, sir.

36:49.824 --> 36:52.191
Well, you could have
at least explained

36:52.243 --> 36:55.412
to the Russian Consul how
the van's brakes went out

36:55.496 --> 36:57.363
on the way to
HPD impound.

36:57.431 --> 36:59.916
Could have saved us a
whole lot of trouble.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.086
You are absolutely right.

37:03.170 --> 37:04.421
I am so sorry, Governor.

37:06.724 --> 37:10.226
Your task force attempted
to kidnap a Russian citizen.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.178
This is an
international incident.

37:12.229 --> 37:14.564
How far do you want
to push this, Consul?

37:14.648 --> 37:16.933
Because the evidence is back.

37:17.017 --> 37:21.771
Your friend, Mr. Vonakov,
killed Victoria Chase,

37:21.856 --> 37:24.691
which means you are harboring

37:24.742 --> 37:27.677
a murderer, and you
lied to us about it.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.196
That makes you
an accessory.

37:30.247 --> 37:33.616
You want to play the
"international incident" card? Fine.

37:33.701 --> 37:36.820
But you might want to get
all the facts straight.

37:36.887 --> 37:40.707
You know, before you make
that call to mother Russia.

37:48.799 --> 37:50.533
Uncuff him.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.944
You're not getting off
that easy.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.097
♪

38:31.175 --> 38:33.643
♪

38:57.701 --> 38:59.586
Hey.
Hey.

38:59.653 --> 39:03.873
I'm, uh... just getting ready
to get out of here.

39:03.958 --> 39:04.924
What's up?

39:04.992 --> 39:06.993
Oh, um, I have
something for you.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.294
Two things, actually,

39:08.345 --> 39:11.748
but consider the first one
a Valentine's gift.

39:11.815 --> 39:14.166
Okay.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.776
U-H season tickets?

39:24.895 --> 39:25.929
How'd you get these?

39:25.996 --> 39:28.014
When you and Danny
were arguing,

39:28.065 --> 39:30.733
I snuck in and I
outbid you both.

39:30.818 --> 39:32.735
And I'm giving them
to you, since, um...

39:32.820 --> 39:34.687
since I won't be able
to use them anymore.

39:34.738 --> 39:36.289
What are you talking about?

39:38.325 --> 39:39.576
The second thing
in that envelope

39:39.660 --> 39:41.711
is my letter of resignation.

39:47.534 --> 39:50.003
The governor.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.671
Yeah. He gave me a choice.

39:51.722 --> 39:55.475
And he asked me, uh,
whose side I was on--

39:55.542 --> 39:57.477
the state of Hawaii's
or Five-O's?

39:59.546 --> 40:01.147
I said, "Both."

40:01.214 --> 40:03.016
He said, "Wrong answer."

40:05.519 --> 40:07.971
Here, you can
have this back, okay?

40:08.038 --> 40:09.355
Because I don't accept
your resignation.

40:09.406 --> 40:11.074
And I'm gonna go, and I'm
gonna talk to the governor,

40:11.158 --> 40:12.008
and I'm gonna straighten
this whole thing out.

40:12.033 --> 40:13.233
No, Steve. It's okay.

40:13.377 --> 40:15.061
He's right.

40:15.112 --> 40:16.496
He's got a point.
I mean, the governor put me

40:16.563 --> 40:17.897
on this team to be
his eyes and ears.

40:17.948 --> 40:21.034
He said there'd be repercussions
if we crossed the line.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.168
Which we did.

40:22.235 --> 40:24.287
Repeatedly.

40:24.371 --> 40:25.305
I'm really...

40:25.372 --> 40:28.007
...sorry.
This is my fault, Lori, and...

40:28.075 --> 40:28.992
No.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.843
If anything, it's my fault.

40:30.911 --> 40:32.912
Honestly, I...

40:35.248 --> 40:36.382
I let things slide

40:36.433 --> 40:39.085
because, uh...

40:39.136 --> 40:43.022
because of my...
my feelings for you.

40:45.492 --> 40:47.860
And the rest of the team,
of course, but, um...

40:47.928 --> 40:50.780
Yeah, I... I let
a lot of things slide.

40:54.068 --> 40:55.985
What are you
going to do?

40:56.070 --> 40:57.787
You gonna go back
to Homeland Security?

40:57.871 --> 41:00.540
Yeah. I'm gonna
go back East.

41:00.607 --> 41:02.959
My family's there,
and my friends are there.

41:03.043 --> 41:05.228
It's for the best.

41:06.279 --> 41:08.331
This is good-bye...
Is this good-bye?

41:08.415 --> 41:10.466
Is that what we're doing,
we're saying good-bye right now?

41:13.504 --> 41:15.855
Yeah. I guess it's good-bye.

41:15.923 --> 41:17.924
I'm gonna miss you.

41:38.112 --> 41:39.812
Hi.

41:39.863 --> 41:40.897
Hi.

41:40.964 --> 41:42.648
Happy Valentine's Day.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.167
Aw...

41:44.251 --> 41:46.402
Whoa, what happened
to you? Are you okay?

41:46.470 --> 41:47.367
- Oh, this?
- Yeah.

41:47.392 --> 41:49.473
Yeah. Another, uh,
another day at the office.

41:49.707 --> 41:51.374
You know how it is.

41:51.458 --> 41:52.592
So... what's all this?

41:52.659 --> 41:54.077
It's chocolate.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.295
It's Valentine's Day. You said
you were good with chocolates

41:56.346 --> 41:58.014
on Valentine's Day.

41:58.098 --> 41:59.432
That's very funny.
Right.

41:59.499 --> 42:00.883
Yeah. Come in.

42:02.152 --> 42:06.639
So, uh... what's with
the bag and the uniform?

42:06.690 --> 42:10.810
I felt bad that our weekend
got blown up by a case.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.762
And, uh...

42:12.830 --> 42:15.481
I figured since I was due
for my reserve drill,

42:15.532 --> 42:17.133
I'd put in a request to, um,

42:17.201 --> 42:19.652
to do it on the Enterprise.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.170
Really?

42:21.238 --> 42:23.856
Yeah, with you.

42:23.907 --> 42:26.159
Huh.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.161
You know, that's, um...

42:28.212 --> 42:29.662
so much better than chocolate.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.881
I thought you'd like that.
Yeah.

42:37.504 --> 42:41.591
Now, you know that you will
also be doing your reserve

42:41.675 --> 42:43.793
with about 3,000
other sailors, right?

42:43.861 --> 42:45.822
So, we're not gonna get
a whole lot of time together.

42:45.847 --> 42:46.596
Right.

42:46.597 --> 42:50.516
Yeah... but, um...
it's a really long flight.
