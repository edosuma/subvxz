00:04.715 --> 00:06.131
<i>something along</i>

00:06.133 --> 00:08.268
Okay, no more dating.

00:08.368 --> 00:09.952
I am ready to settle down.

00:09.954 --> 00:12.471
<i>And at the time,</i>
<i>I probably thought I meant it.</i>

00:12.473 --> 00:14.723
<i>But, kids, I'll be honest.</i>

00:14.725 --> 00:16.491
<i>Being single's fun.</i>

00:16.493 --> 00:19.311
<i>As a young unattached man</i>
<i>in New York City,</i>

00:19.313 --> 00:20.712
<i>I had a great time.</i>

00:20.714 --> 00:22.981
<i>A great time.</i>

00:22.983 --> 00:25.317
<i>What was I saying? Oh, yeah.</i>

00:25.319 --> 00:28.186
<i>I had such a great time that</i>

00:28.188 --> 00:30.105
to make me want to settle down.

00:30.107 --> 00:32.607
<i>And that someone...</i>

00:32.610 --> 00:35.277
<i>was Jeanette.</i>

00:35.279 --> 00:37.913
What made Jeanette so special?
<i>Well...</i>

00:37.915 --> 00:39.665
That was a foul!

00:40.701 --> 00:42.751
<i>Jeanette was the last girl</i>
<i>I dated</i>

00:42.753 --> 00:44.036

00:48.208 --> 00:50.453

She broke your TV
with a beer bottle?

01:11.067 --> 01:13.434
In her defense,
she was aiming for the window.

01:13.436 --> 01:15.403
Dude, you gotta get rid
of this girl.

01:15.405 --> 01:17.522
Agreed.
Cray-cray gotta go bye-bye

01:17.524 --> 01:18.740

01:18.742 --> 01:20.074
Oh, really?

And are you guys saying this

or because you want me

You know what, Ted?
That reminds me.

02:09.793 --> 02:11.959
I just bought this
antique Swiss clock,

02:11.961 --> 02:14.445
but Robin won't let us put it
in the apartment,

02:14.447 --> 02:17.114
so I was gonna leave it
at your place.

02:17.116 --> 02:18.416
Only problem? It's broken.

02:18.418 --> 02:21.252
So I was just gonna sit here
and try to fix it

02:21.254 --> 02:24.338
while maybe you tell us what you
and Jeanette did last night?

02:24.340 --> 02:26.974
Okay. Well, uh, Jeanette
is a big Marilyn Monroe fan.

02:28.011 --> 02:30.761
There you go!
Now it's working!

02:30.763 --> 02:32.930
Sorry. Sorry. Go on. Go on.
She's a Marilyn Monroe fan

02:32.932 --> 02:34.765
so I guess you watched
one of her movies?

02:34.767 --> 02:37.435
Uh, No, we had a séance.

02:38.605 --> 02:40.488
Look at that! Good as new.

02:40.490 --> 02:43.641
Anyway, were you able
to contact Marilyn

02:43.643 --> 02:45.443
in the spirit world?

02:45.445 --> 02:47.912
No. We talked to her cat.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.917
Screw loose!
That's the problem.

02:52.919 --> 02:54.785
Uh-oh.

02:54.787 --> 02:55.953
Looks like somebody's
hungry.

02:55.955 --> 02:57.538
I'm gonna get
his food ready.

02:57.540 --> 03:00.007
Robin, can you grab him?

03:00.009 --> 03:03.211
Can I? Try and stop me!

03:03.213 --> 03:05.163
<i>Now, kids,</i>
<i>what Lily didn't realize--</i>

03:05.165 --> 03:07.698
<i>what none of us realized,</i>
<i>in fact-- was that</i>

03:07.700 --> 03:10.034
in the eight months since your
<i>cousin Marvin was born,</i>

03:10.036 --> 03:11.969
Robin had never once held him.

03:11.971 --> 03:15.172
<i>The truth was, the thought</i>
<i>of holding him terrified her,</i>

03:15.174 --> 03:18.526
<i>so she had always avoided it,</i>
<i>ever so discreetly.</i>

03:18.528 --> 03:19.977
Can you hold...
Oh, shoot! Look at that!

03:19.979 --> 03:22.613
Oh, geez.

03:22.615 --> 03:23.948
I got him.

03:23.950 --> 03:25.533
Come here,
you little munchkin.

03:25.535 --> 03:27.017
Aw, man...

03:27.019 --> 03:29.403
Oh, well, I call next.

03:29.405 --> 03:32.957
Well, I should go. It's time
for Jeanette's... something.

03:32.959 --> 03:35.743
Time for Jeanette's what, Ted?

03:35.745 --> 03:39.747
Uh, we're taking her dog
to an exorcist.

03:39.749 --> 03:42.633
Wow, Ted, that sounds...

03:47.222 --> 03:49.873
Crap, it's really broken now.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.476
Okay, fine. I admit it.
She's crazy.

03:52.478 --> 03:53.594
Obviously.

03:53.596 --> 03:56.097
But I'm not in this
for the long haul.

03:56.099 --> 03:57.881
It's just, you know,
it's just fun.

03:57.883 --> 03:59.934
Of course it's fun, <i>at first.</i>

03:59.936 --> 04:02.320
But then when she starts calling
out the name of her

04:02.322 --> 04:05.055
high school science teacher
in the throes of passion,

04:05.057 --> 04:06.574
it's really fun.

04:06.576 --> 04:09.660
But then when she starts
bringing knives into bed

04:09.662 --> 04:12.496
and making you fear
for your safety?

04:12.498 --> 04:14.248
It's really, <i>really</i> fun.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.118
But then when she starts
unbuttoning your pants

04:17.120 --> 04:21.238
while you're being forced
to drive blindfolded

04:21.240 --> 04:26.110
down the freeway
with a gun pointed at your...

04:26.112 --> 04:28.596
I'm sorry,
what were we talking about?

04:28.598 --> 04:29.597
Jeanette.

04:29.599 --> 04:30.715
Oh, right. That girl's crazy.

04:30.717 --> 04:33.100
You gotta break up with her.
I know.

04:33.102 --> 04:35.603
I know. You're right.
I-I have to break up with her.

04:35.605 --> 04:37.588
I should do it
in a public place, though,

04:37.590 --> 04:39.023
so she doesn't flip out.

04:39.025 --> 04:41.609
<i>So the next night,</i>
<i>I met her in a public place</i>

04:41.611 --> 04:42.944
<i>so she wouldn't flip out.</i>

04:42.946 --> 04:44.278
I will kill you, ref!

04:44.280 --> 04:46.530
I will kill you in front
of all these people!

04:46.532 --> 04:48.282
Oh, boy.
What, you think I won't

04:48.284 --> 04:49.951
just 'cause I'm in
a public place?!

04:49.953 --> 04:52.936
I'll go to jail for the rest
of my life if I have to!

04:55.541 --> 04:58.492
Listen, before the game starts,
I think we need to talk.

04:58.494 --> 05:00.277
I can't believe
Ted's dead.

05:00.279 --> 05:01.545
I know.

05:01.547 --> 05:03.080
What a way to go.

05:03.082 --> 05:04.749
Killed by a bazooka.

05:04.751 --> 05:08.886
All right, all right,
so I'm not on my game today.

05:08.888 --> 05:10.004
Anyway...

05:10.006 --> 05:12.340
I gotta hop out for a bit.

05:12.342 --> 05:13.557
You guys stay here.

05:13.559 --> 05:16.477
Oh, and, um,
if Jeanette comes by,

05:16.479 --> 05:18.629
do not let her into
the apartment.

05:18.631 --> 05:20.297
Don't let her in. Got it.

05:20.299 --> 05:22.966
Guys, this is serious.
This girl is like bedbugs.

05:22.968 --> 05:25.603
Once she's in the apartment,
there's no getting her out.

05:25.605 --> 05:28.489
Ted, buddy,

05:28.491 --> 05:30.191
how long have we been dealing

05:30.193 --> 05:33.244
with Barney's insane
girlfriends? Years.

05:33.246 --> 05:35.246
Nigh on a decade!

05:35.248 --> 05:38.449
I had to testify
in five competency hearings.

05:38.451 --> 05:40.785
I think we can handle Jeanette.

05:40.787 --> 05:42.370
Okay, okay.

05:42.372 --> 05:44.372
See you soon.

05:46.626 --> 05:48.876
That kid. Am I right?

05:50.329 --> 05:52.963
Now look who forgot his keys.

05:55.268 --> 05:56.684
What is it?

06:00.356 --> 06:03.190
<i>Meanwhile, Lily and Robin</i>
<i>were out getting lunch,</i>

06:03.192 --> 06:05.559
<i>when disaster struck.</i>

06:05.561 --> 06:07.845
Oh, God, I left his binky
on that bus!

06:07.847 --> 06:09.346
Wait. Don't you have
other binkies?

06:09.348 --> 06:11.065
That one's his favorite!
He'll know the difference!

06:11.067 --> 06:13.317
I'm not gonna let
this be the reason

06:13.319 --> 06:14.402
he resents me later in life!

06:14.404 --> 06:17.688
If he starts crying,
just pick him up!

06:18.875 --> 06:21.876
What? Uh, uh...

06:21.878 --> 06:26.664
Okay, okay.
Yeah,  there, there, there. Okay.

06:26.666 --> 06:29.500
Hey, I'm back.
Did I miss anything?

06:29.502 --> 06:30.885
Nope.

06:30.887 --> 06:31.869
Did Jeanette come by?

06:31.871 --> 06:33.003
Jeanette? I know
lots of Jeanettes.

06:33.005 --> 06:34.922
Um...

06:34.924 --> 06:36.691
Guys!
Okay, she came by

06:36.693 --> 06:38.726
because she forgot
her book.

06:38.728 --> 06:41.512
So we let her go up
in your room and get it.

06:41.514 --> 06:43.213
And then?

06:43.215 --> 06:44.982
And then what?

06:44.984 --> 06:47.318
And then she left?

06:47.320 --> 06:51.272
I think she left.

06:52.825 --> 06:55.710
Are you sure she left?

06:55.712 --> 06:59.413
I am... 90% sure...

06:59.415 --> 07:01.365
that she left.

07:02.452 --> 07:04.502
80 percent.

07:05.505 --> 07:07.171
Actually, I'm gonna
change my answer.

07:07.173 --> 07:09.406
I am now starting to
think she never left,

07:09.408 --> 07:13.627
and instead she barricaded
herself in your room.

07:13.629 --> 07:15.379
And I'm never coming out!

07:16.548 --> 07:18.349
A hundred percent.

07:22.736 --> 07:24.398
I cannot believe
you guys!

07:24.498 --> 07:27.762
Well, maybe if you had given us
a warning that she was crazy!

07:27.880 --> 07:29.522
Dude, it's okay.

07:29.525 --> 07:31.358
She can't stay
in there forever.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.911
She'll have to come out
to eat and drink

07:33.913 --> 07:35.579
and go to the bathroom, right?

07:35.581 --> 07:37.498
<i>Now, a few months earlier,</i>

07:37.500 --> 07:40.100

<i>and some intelligent,</i>
<i>forward-thinking</i>

07:42.104 --> 07:44.204
<i>New Yorkers took it</i>
<i>as a wake-up call,</i>

07:44.206 --> 07:46.423
<i>making sure to stock</i>
<i>their bedrooms with enough</i>

07:47.676 --> 07:49.426
not to mention a portable waste
<i>management system.</i>

07:49.428 --> 07:51.828
<i>It was really</i>
<i>the smart thing to do.</i>

07:53.664 --> 07:54.882
You dumbass!

07:54.884 --> 07:58.635
Really, Ted. How could you be so
unbelievably stupid?

07:58.637 --> 08:01.004
No, no, you guys are the ones
who invited

08:01.006 --> 08:03.974
a vampire into my apartment!
This is your fault!

08:03.976 --> 08:05.559
And P.S., if this disaster

08:05.561 --> 08:08.028
had been a superstorm
instead of a hot lunatic,

08:08.030 --> 08:10.731
you'd all be begging to eat
my freeze-dried protein paste

08:10.733 --> 08:13.700
and crap in my biohazard bucket.
Just sayin'.

08:13.702 --> 08:14.768
I got it.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.370
It was on the
floor of the bus.

08:16.372 --> 08:20.023
I should
probably throw it out. Eh.

08:20.691 --> 08:22.292
Did he give you any problems?

08:22.294 --> 08:24.745
He cried a little,
but then he stopped.

08:24.747 --> 08:27.965
Oh, good.
Anything else happen?

08:27.967 --> 08:29.366
Nope.

08:29.368 --> 08:31.885
That... is... it.

08:33.855 --> 08:35.923
All gone!

08:35.924 --> 08:37.640
We have to do this more often.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.226
Oh, we totally do.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.010
I can't believe Marvin's
in kindergarten.

08:41.013 --> 08:42.980
He's growing up so fast.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.566
Can I confess something to you?

08:45.568 --> 08:49.236
Remember the day you left
Marvin's binky on the bus

08:49.238 --> 08:52.022
and you left me alone with him?
Yeah.

08:52.024 --> 08:55.058
Well, I didn't tell you this
at the time, but...

08:56.412 --> 09:00.447
Okay, okay.
Yeah, there, there, there.

09:00.449 --> 09:01.731
Okay, shh, shh.

09:01.733 --> 09:05.568
Oh, no, it looks like
somebody's not happy.

09:05.570 --> 09:06.920
No kidding.
I'm miserable.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.188
Listen to this thing.

09:08.190 --> 09:11.091
He probably just wants
to be held.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.676
I think you're right.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.761
Can you do it?

09:14.763 --> 09:16.597
All right.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.582
Come here, handsome. Oh.
Yeah.

09:19.584 --> 09:21.184
Yes.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.936
Oh.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.422
I let a stranger pick up Marvin.
I'm sorry.

09:25.424 --> 09:27.357
It's just, I hadn't actually
picked him up

09:27.359 --> 09:29.226
at that point,
and I was scared, so...

09:29.228 --> 09:31.528
You know what?
It was four years ago.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.865
He's obviously fine.
Don't even worry about it.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.316
Really?
Yeah.

09:36.318 --> 09:38.151
Thank you.

09:38.153 --> 09:41.271
I mean, as long as there's
not more to that story.

09:41.273 --> 09:45.409
Nope. That... is... it.

09:47.445 --> 09:49.379
Jeanette, you
have to leave!

09:49.381 --> 09:50.414
In a minute!

09:50.416 --> 09:52.582
I still haven't
found that book!

09:53.785 --> 09:55.802
Listen, Jeanette,
I didn't want to do this,

09:55.804 --> 09:58.121
but I called the police.
They're on their way.

09:58.123 --> 09:59.806
All units, all units.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.391
Possible 10-90 in progress

10:01.393 --> 10:04.428
at 521 West 82nd,
apartment 15.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.846
Where's that coming from?

10:05.848 --> 10:07.297
Is that you, Dolores?

10:07.299 --> 10:09.349
Jeanette?
Hey, girl. How you been?

10:09.351 --> 10:11.902
Oh, you know, I'm just doing me.

10:11.904 --> 10:14.571
Anyway, I'll check out
that 10-90.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.657
Okay, but remember...

10:16.659 --> 10:18.408
I know, no excessive force.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.078
Last thing I need is another
suspension, am I right?

10:21.080 --> 10:24.247
<i>And that, kids,</i>
<i>was how I found out</i>

10:24.249 --> 10:26.216
what Jeanette did for a living.

10:26.218 --> 10:28.168
Wait a second.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.153
Is she a cop?!

10:30.155 --> 10:31.204
I think she's a cop!

10:31.206 --> 10:32.873
Did you know
she was a cop?!

10:32.875 --> 10:35.175
I didn't know
she was a <i>cop!</i>

10:35.177 --> 10:38.595
Ted, I'm sorry I have to say
this-- Jeanette lives here now.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.797
This is her place.
You're gonna have to leave.

10:40.799 --> 10:41.798
What?

10:41.800 --> 10:42.849
Why don't you have to leave?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.434
They can stay.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.521
Thank you, Officer Jeanette.
Thank you, Officer Jeanette.

10:49.540 --> 10:50.673
All gone.

10:50.675 --> 10:52.025
We need to do this more often.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.310
We totally do.
I can't believe

10:53.312 --> 10:54.811
Marvin's in middle school.

10:54.813 --> 10:56.113
Oh, he's growing up so fast.

10:56.115 --> 10:59.282
Can I confess something to you?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.068
Remember that day
you left Marvin's binky

11:01.070 --> 11:03.487
on the bus and I let
that old lady pick him up?

11:03.489 --> 11:06.456
I seem to recall
that was the entire story.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.792
There's a little bit more.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.360
There, there, little one.

11:10.362 --> 11:13.296
Let's put you back
in your strolly-poo,

11:13.298 --> 11:16.967
so you can drift off
to dreamy-dreamy land.

11:18.336 --> 11:20.420
Oh, thank you
so much.

11:20.422 --> 11:22.089
Yeah, this is my first time
alone with him,

11:22.091 --> 11:24.641
and, you know, um, I have this
weird feeling that I'm gonna,

11:24.643 --> 11:27.344
I don't know, like, drop him
or injure him in some way,

11:27.346 --> 11:28.979
which is completely insane.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.647
But...
Oh, heavens.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.815
Oh, my God!

11:31.817 --> 11:32.566
Oh, my God.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.484
I know, I'm so sorry.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.902
Well, you know what?

11:35.904 --> 11:38.321
That was what, 12 years ago?

11:38.323 --> 11:39.906
Don't even worry about it.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.158
Really?
Yeah.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.360
Oh, thank you.

11:43.362 --> 11:46.113
Just promise me
there's no more to that story.

11:47.064 --> 11:50.167
Nope, that is it.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.903
Are you sure
you want to do this?

11:53.905 --> 11:55.088
The girl's a cop.

11:55.090 --> 11:59.009
Yeah, this seems
like a really bad idea.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.410
I don't care.

12:00.412 --> 12:02.679
I am going into
that bedroom

12:02.681 --> 12:04.131
because this is my home

12:04.133 --> 12:06.433
and I have to defend it.

12:06.435 --> 12:08.218
But mostly because

12:08.220 --> 12:10.086
my allergy medication

12:10.088 --> 12:12.422
is in there!

12:12.424 --> 12:14.090
All right, just
be careful, okay?

12:14.092 --> 12:15.809
This girl is
really crazy.

12:15.811 --> 12:19.095
Yeah, why can't she just accept
the fact that you guys broke up?

12:19.097 --> 12:21.982
I know, I know, why can't
she just accept that?

12:21.984 --> 12:23.900
Why, it's, like, why?

12:26.438 --> 12:29.105
It might be because
we didn't actually break up.

12:29.107 --> 12:30.624
Aw, man.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.577
Jeanette, come on,
that's vintage vinyl.

12:37.685 --> 12:40.184
Ted, did you
or didn't you break up

12:40.284 --> 12:41.766
with Jeanette last night?

12:41.768 --> 12:44.736
I don't know,
it's kind of confusing.

12:44.738 --> 12:47.089
I think we need to talk.

12:47.091 --> 12:49.491
Oh, oh, okay.

12:49.493 --> 12:51.326
I see where this is going.

12:51.328 --> 12:53.328
You're in love with Lily.

12:53.330 --> 12:54.496
That's it, isn't it?

12:54.498 --> 12:56.381
What? No, I...

12:56.383 --> 12:59.117
Like I should be surprised
with her fancy medical degree

12:59.119 --> 13:01.386
and her sexy Southern drawl.

13:01.388 --> 13:02.638
What? She's not...

13:02.640 --> 13:04.256
Don't talk to me,
don't look at me.

13:04.258 --> 13:07.142
I hate you and I never
want to see you again!

13:08.794 --> 13:10.145
And then things got crazy

13:10.147 --> 13:12.814
and we got thrown out
of the Barclays Center.

13:12.816 --> 13:16.068
I don't know, it felt
pretty breakup-y.

13:16.070 --> 13:17.969
Mm.
Anyway,

13:17.971 --> 13:20.656
we parted on pretty
bad terms, so...

13:20.658 --> 13:23.241
I kind of thought maybe
I could...

13:23.243 --> 13:24.776
Never contact her again
and hope she'd take

13:24.778 --> 13:26.478
the hint and just
leave you alone?

13:26.480 --> 13:28.030
Barney, give me some credit.

13:28.032 --> 13:30.582
Was that the plan?
Yes.

13:32.502 --> 13:34.119
All gone.
We need to do this more often.

13:34.121 --> 13:35.253
We totally do.

13:35.255 --> 13:36.538
I can't believe Marvin's
in high school.

13:36.540 --> 13:37.655
He's growing up so fast.

13:37.657 --> 13:39.624
Can I confess something to you?
Oh, no. What?

13:39.626 --> 13:40.825
What happened?

13:40.827 --> 13:42.961
Tell me what you did to my son.

13:43.930 --> 13:46.848
This is not going
well at all.

13:46.850 --> 13:48.283
Oh, honey, you are shaking.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.935
Let's get you out
of the cold.

13:49.937 --> 13:51.937
What's open near here?

13:51.939 --> 13:53.772
♪

13:55.274 --> 13:58.676
You took my infant child
to a strip club?

13:58.678 --> 13:59.895
It was just topless.

13:59.897 --> 14:01.863
He saw yours
all the time anyway.

14:01.865 --> 14:03.799
Okay, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have done that,

14:03.801 --> 14:05.701
but that is all there is.

14:05.703 --> 14:07.402
Okay, there is no more
to the story.

14:07.404 --> 14:09.204
I have now told you everything.

14:09.206 --> 14:11.440
<i>All gone.</i>

14:11.442 --> 14:13.992
We need to do this more often.
We totally do.

14:13.994 --> 14:15.660
I can't believe
Marvin's driving.

14:15.662 --> 14:16.962
He's growing up so fast.

14:16.964 --> 14:18.380
Okay, there's one other thing.

14:18.382 --> 14:19.548
What?

14:19.550 --> 14:21.666
Well, I have to go use
the ladies' room.

14:21.668 --> 14:23.552
Can you watch him for me?

14:23.554 --> 14:24.702
Of course.

14:24.704 --> 14:26.471
I could just eat you up.

14:28.058 --> 14:30.542
You left him
with a complete stranger?

14:30.544 --> 14:31.876
He could've been...

14:31.878 --> 14:33.478
Robin, how could you?
Lily,

14:33.480 --> 14:35.564
please, okay,
it was 16 years ago.

14:35.566 --> 14:37.816
He's fine.

14:37.818 --> 14:39.184
You're right.

14:39.186 --> 14:41.219
It's fine.

14:41.221 --> 14:45.273
God, it feels so good to have
gotten this off my chest.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.442
Finally it is all on the table.

14:47.444 --> 14:50.112
All secrets are exposed
and there is nothing left

14:50.114 --> 14:51.663
to be revealed.

14:52.515 --> 14:54.116
All gone.
We need to do this more...

14:54.118 --> 14:55.867
There's more to the story.
Damn it, Robin.

14:55.869 --> 14:57.869
What could you possibly
have left out?

14:57.871 --> 15:00.422
It's just there's, um,

15:00.424 --> 15:05.427
one little detail that
I may have slightly altered.

15:05.429 --> 15:07.546
If he starts crying,
just pick him up.

15:11.717 --> 15:13.552
Yeah, there, there.

15:13.554 --> 15:15.470
Come on,
buddy, shh.

15:15.472 --> 15:17.522
Looks like
somebody's unhappy.

15:17.524 --> 15:19.191
No kidding, I'm miserable.

15:19.193 --> 15:20.609
Listen to this thing.

15:20.611 --> 15:22.110
Maybe he needs to be held.

15:22.112 --> 15:24.362
I think you're right.

15:24.364 --> 15:26.198
Can you do it?

15:26.200 --> 15:27.566
Sure.

15:27.568 --> 15:28.933
Come here, handsome.

15:28.935 --> 15:30.485
Come here, come here,
you handsome devil, you.

15:30.487 --> 15:31.736
You're such a beautiful...

15:31.738 --> 15:33.205
Aw, you're such
a cool dude.

15:33.207 --> 15:35.874
Oh, look at you, oh.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.576
All right, there, there,
little one, there, there.

15:37.578 --> 15:39.961
Let me put you back
in your strolly-poo

15:39.963 --> 15:43.114

to dreamy-dreamy land.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.083
Okay? All right.

15:45.085 --> 15:46.134
Thank you so much.

15:46.136 --> 15:47.219
Hey, don't worry about it.

15:47.221 --> 15:48.336
It's my first time
alone with him,

15:48.338 --> 15:49.554
and I just have
this weird feeling

15:49.556 --> 15:50.839
I'm gonna drop him

15:50.841 --> 15:52.007
or injure him in some way.

15:52.009 --> 15:53.175
I know it's completely
insane...

15:53.177 --> 15:54.392
Oh, heavens, oh,
watch it, no!

15:54.394 --> 15:55.760
No!

15:56.479 --> 15:59.431
This is not going well at all.

16:00.601 --> 16:02.767
Oh, hon, you're shaking.

16:02.769 --> 16:03.735
Let's get out
of the cold.

16:03.737 --> 16:05.487
Is there anything open
near here?

16:06.824 --> 16:08.473
♪

16:09.975 --> 16:12.194
Hey, I need to go to the ladies'
room-- can you watch him for me?

16:12.196 --> 16:14.446
Of course.
I could just eat you up.

16:14.448 --> 16:16.581
Look at you,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.869
You waited 17 years to tell me

16:20.871 --> 16:24.089
that you met the greatest boxer
of all time?

16:24.091 --> 16:28.460
My son was rocked to sleep
by Senator Mike Tyson?

16:28.462 --> 16:30.929
I wanted to tell you, believe me.
How could you...?

16:30.931 --> 16:33.098
Okay, this is the
right thing to do.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.884
You got to go up there and
break up with her for real.

16:35.886 --> 16:37.669
And don't worry,
if anything happens,

16:37.671 --> 16:39.688
just scream,
we'll come rescue you.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.356
Okay.

16:59.458 --> 17:02.410
Did you guys not hear me
screaming up there?

17:02.412 --> 17:04.628
Aw, I feel so awful.

17:04.631 --> 17:05.797
We went to get subs.

17:05.799 --> 17:07.499
We got you one though.

17:07.501 --> 17:09.550
We didn't get you one.

17:10.502 --> 17:12.337
So, Jeanette's squatting
in your room?

17:12.339 --> 17:13.954
What are you guys doing here?

17:13.957 --> 17:16.174
We heard you screaming
from three blocks away.

17:16.175 --> 17:17.309
Why is she in there?

17:17.310 --> 17:19.261
Lily, there is no reason why.

17:19.262 --> 17:21.512
That's like asking
why is the earth round?

17:21.515 --> 17:23.381
Why does the sun come up
in the morning?

17:23.383 --> 17:24.848
What do I do for a living?

17:24.851 --> 17:27.685
There are some questions we're
not meant to know the answer to.

17:27.688 --> 17:30.989
Crazy girls are crazy
because they're crazy.

17:30.991 --> 17:33.191
I-I don't think it's
quite that simple.

17:33.193 --> 17:34.359
I was talking

17:34.361 --> 17:36.244
to a friend of mine
about Ted and Jeanette.

17:36.246 --> 17:38.229
Oh, great, what
friend is this?

17:38.231 --> 17:42.150
Uh, just this wise
old lady that I know.

17:42.152 --> 17:43.485
Here's the thing
about crazy.

17:43.487 --> 17:45.837
When a guy sends mixed
signals to a girl,

17:45.839 --> 17:48.390
it takes a toll on her
psychological well-being.

17:48.392 --> 17:50.926
You want to know why
a girl acts crazy,

17:50.928 --> 17:52.510
look at the guy she's dating.

17:52.512 --> 17:54.412
Then you really see some crazy.

17:54.414 --> 17:56.348
Trust me.

17:57.633 --> 18:00.435
Are you Mike Tyson?

18:00.437 --> 18:01.469
Now, hold on.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.921
I've dated tons
of crazy girls in my life,

18:03.923 --> 18:08.426
and not once have I ever treated
them with anything other than...

18:08.428 --> 18:09.811
Oh, right, I'm a monster.

18:09.813 --> 18:13.064
Maybe the old lady
with the face tattoo is right.

18:13.066 --> 18:15.933
Maybe the reason Jeanette's
acting this way

18:15.935 --> 18:17.202
is Ted.

18:17.204 --> 18:19.154
Me? How is this my fault?

18:19.156 --> 18:21.456
Yeah, come on, this is Ted
we're talking about.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.575
I'm sure he didn't do anything
to lead her on

18:23.577 --> 18:26.077
or send mixed signals,
right, Ted?

18:27.246 --> 18:29.247
Don't talk to me,
don't look at me.

18:29.249 --> 18:32.250
I hate you and I never
want to see you again!

18:37.006 --> 18:39.641
And we got thrown out
of the Barclays Center.

18:39.643 --> 18:41.259
Okay, that's disappointing.

18:41.261 --> 18:42.927
So disappointing.

18:42.929 --> 18:45.897
Seriously.

18:45.899 --> 18:47.899
But that was last night.
I mean, it's not like...

18:49.101 --> 18:51.186
Listen, Jeanette, we really need

18:51.188 --> 18:52.854
to have a serious talk
about our...

18:52.856 --> 18:56.274
So, did Lily leave
these boots here

18:56.276 --> 18:58.410
or was it some other bitch?

19:01.163 --> 19:04.649
Marshall, Barney, help me!

19:04.651 --> 19:07.118
I don't think they're coming.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.937
I guess not.

19:13.926 --> 19:15.159
It's those red boots.

19:15.161 --> 19:17.128
They just look sexy
on everyone.

19:17.130 --> 19:19.681
Okay, Ted,
what is with the red boots?

19:19.683 --> 19:21.883
You're a smart guy,
you've got some taste,

19:21.885 --> 19:23.385
you got a visual sense, I mean,

19:23.387 --> 19:25.169
you're an architect
for Pete's sakes.

19:25.171 --> 19:27.055
How can you look at
those boots and think...

19:27.057 --> 19:29.507
Oh, my God, I'm holding it,
I'm holding the baby.

19:29.509 --> 19:30.942
What, you've never
held him before?

19:30.944 --> 19:32.677
Uh, tons of times.

19:32.679 --> 19:35.613
This-this is not a
big moment for me.

19:35.615 --> 19:37.115
This is exhilarating.

19:38.235 --> 19:41.653
Look, yes, I know what
you're gonna say.

19:41.655 --> 19:43.705
I have to break up with her.
No,

19:43.707 --> 19:45.857
I was actually gonna
say the opposite.

19:45.859 --> 19:48.293
I think you need to be
with Jeanette right now.

19:48.295 --> 19:50.194
Because she's the one.

19:50.196 --> 19:51.379
No. What? No.

19:51.381 --> 19:53.331
She's insane.

19:53.333 --> 19:56.167
But I think you are also
a little insane right now.

19:56.169 --> 19:58.536
So I think
you need to go

19:58.538 --> 20:01.556
be with your crazy girl for a
while and when it all goes down

20:01.558 --> 20:03.758
in flames-- and I don't mean
that figuratively,

20:03.760 --> 20:05.810
I expect there
to be actual flames...

20:05.812 --> 20:07.679
<i>And there were.</i>

20:07.681 --> 20:10.065
...we'll be here for you
because we love you.

20:13.486 --> 20:16.721
Jeanette I just want
to say that, uh,

20:16.723 --> 20:19.240
you going through
my stuff like that...

20:20.876 --> 20:23.695
You are really
something special.

20:25.164 --> 20:28.199
I'm gonna send Lily
a dead animal in the mail.

20:29.401 --> 20:31.419
I think I'm falling for you.

20:31.421 --> 20:34.289
I think we should have
a three-way with my therapist.

20:34.291 --> 20:35.924
He's 70.

20:35.926 --> 20:38.676
What is your ring size?

20:46.526 --> 20:48.656
Robin.

20:48.657 --> 20:50.646
It's 3:00 in the morning.

20:50.647 --> 20:51.563
Really?

20:51.564 --> 20:53.347
Yeah, you sure you
don't want to just

20:53.349 --> 20:56.484
put him in the crib and,
you know, go home?

20:56.486 --> 20:58.319
No, I'm good.

20:58.321 --> 21:00.321
Okay.

21:00.323 --> 21:01.406
Good night.

21:01.408 --> 21:02.690
Good night.

21:02.692 --> 21:06.792

21:06.830 --> 21:08.846
What's that smell?

21:08.848 --> 21:11.482
Lily! Lily!
