WEBVTT

00:06.633 --> 00:10.303
So you telling me
I can't get any pancakes at this IHOP?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.013
It's not the place you're thinking of.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.682
This is the Interdimensional
Hole of Pancakes.

00:14.933 --> 00:16.851
It's the crossroads of all dimensions.

00:17.060 --> 00:20.146
Like Grand Central Station,
but for space and time.

00:20.313 --> 00:23.191
If you eat anything in this IHOP,
you will literally explode.

00:23.483 --> 00:25.110
Yeah, I know, it's IHOP.

00:26.736 --> 00:28.196
Why are we meeting there?

00:28.488 --> 00:32.784
The Judge's powers are limited in the IHOP,
so she can't just retire me on the spot.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.286
And I believe that when she hears
what I've discovered

00:35.370 --> 00:37.539
about the points system,
she'll take our side.

00:37.789 --> 00:40.708
If not, then we'll jump through a portal
to another dimension

00:40.959 --> 00:44.045
hope our molecules don't liquefy,
and regroup from there.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.213
Excuse me.

00:45.755 --> 00:46.673
OK.

00:47.549 --> 00:49.259
Now, watch your step.

00:49.676 --> 00:51.052
Hey, so...

00:51.553 --> 00:52.720
yeah, so...

00:53.221 --> 00:55.265
- I don't wanna go in there!
- I get that.

00:55.390 --> 00:57.308
But come here, come here.
Here are your options.

00:58.601 --> 00:59.519
Option Number one...

01:02.063 --> 01:03.982
Cruel, but necessary.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.490
Oh, look at this.

01:12.949 --> 01:14.159
They added a tenth dimension.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.872
Boy, permits must've been a headache.

01:19.289 --> 01:22.792
Looks like we're inside
a Diane Von Furstenburg pattern.

01:23.251 --> 01:26.087
From spring 2013!

01:26.254 --> 01:30.550
OK, everyone, just be cool,
I know exactly what's going on.

01:31.176 --> 01:33.344
We all smoked too much salvia.

01:33.678 --> 01:36.306
We gotta ride this out for about two,
three minutes...

01:36.514 --> 01:38.808
and then we'll be back
in Pillboi's broken hot tub

01:39.142 --> 01:40.977
and this will all be over.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.403
Hey, is...
is this a good time to talk?

01:50.570 --> 01:52.488
Well, there's no time like the present.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.782
And here, there's neither "no time"

01:54.991 --> 01:56.701
nor "the present!"

01:57.452 --> 01:58.369
Go ahead.

01:58.536 --> 02:02.415
So, you know how me and you used
to be married, when I was dead before?

02:02.790 --> 02:03.833
Mm-hmm.

02:03.958 --> 02:07.086
I think I'm starting to catch feelings again,
for you.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.505
- Mm-hmm.
- And if I don't double-die...

02:09.839 --> 02:13.843
in this IHOP, and the Judge lady
doesn't turn you into a marble...

02:15.678 --> 02:17.430
do you want to try being
boyfriend-girlfriend?

02:17.889 --> 02:19.015
I'm not a girl.

02:19.766 --> 02:23.186
But, yes, I'd very much like to go on
a date with you somewhere, sometime.

02:23.645 --> 02:26.356
As opposed to here, which is nowhere,
at all the times.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.484
- Do you get it?
- Yeah.

02:30.235 --> 02:31.945
Hi! Butthead!

02:33.196 --> 02:36.449
You lie to my face,
disrespect my orders

02:37.367 --> 02:39.369
steal the only key to Earth

02:39.827 --> 02:42.664
meddle with an already
compromised timeline

02:43.248 --> 02:46.542
kidnap the humans into a Janet's void

02:46.709 --> 02:50.171
and now demand a meeting
in the freakin' IHOP?

02:50.797 --> 02:51.965
I hate this place.

02:52.257 --> 02:54.968
I wouldn't have asked for a meet
if it weren't vitally important.

02:55.051 --> 02:57.095
And I promise, no more rule breaking.

02:57.428 --> 02:58.930
Oh yeah? Really? Cool.

02:59.180 --> 03:03.393
Cos it kinda looks like
you stole a book from Accounting!

03:04.560 --> 03:07.522
No more rule breaking, starting now.

03:09.482 --> 03:10.608
Hello, Chidi!

03:10.942 --> 03:12.860
That is a great look for you.

03:13.111 --> 03:15.989
Things don't work out here with old Blondie,
you know who to call.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.532
This bitch!

03:18.032 --> 03:18.950
Sorry...

03:19.701 --> 03:21.035
what is on me right now?

03:21.119 --> 03:22.954
Oops! Where'd you come from, little buddy?

03:23.413 --> 03:24.497
No, don't touch it!

03:24.664 --> 03:26.666
Tahani. Do not touch the Neednoggle.

03:27.125 --> 03:30.545
- What?
- Bad! This is all bad.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.839
Ugh! Humans are such whiners.

03:33.298 --> 03:35.258
Here, hot pants.
Let me take care of it for you.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.343
Help!

03:38.303 --> 03:39.220
Ah!

03:39.679 --> 03:43.599
Ah! Everybody, you're all still standing
in the IHOP.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.227
The Judge simply augmented your reality

03:46.311 --> 03:48.896
to make you feel like
you're in a normal IHOP.

03:49.272 --> 03:52.108
- Very smart.
- Don't suck up to me, you suck-up.

03:52.525 --> 03:55.320
This is far better!
Instead of a slug creature

03:55.403 --> 03:56.738
I have a cute little scarf...

03:56.863 --> 03:58.072
- No! No!
- No, no, no! Don't touch it!

03:58.448 --> 04:00.700
Tahani, that's still the Neednoggle.

04:00.867 --> 04:03.286
The Judge just made it look like a scarf.

04:04.579 --> 04:05.747
- Wonderful.
- Alright.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.667
Why don't we all sit down, so I can
fill the Judge in on what we've learned?

04:10.460 --> 04:13.379
Your Honour, I once stood in front of you
and said I thought

04:13.463 --> 04:15.298
there was something wrong
with the points system.

04:16.049 --> 04:20.345
I finally know what it is -
life now is so complicated

04:20.636 --> 04:24.766
it's impossible for anyone to be
good enough for the Good Place.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.102
I know you don't like to learn
too much about life on Earth

04:28.311 --> 04:31.856
to remain impartial, but these days,
just buying a tomato

04:32.106 --> 04:36.110
at a grocery store means that
you are unwittingly supporting

04:36.444 --> 04:40.948
toxic pesticides, exploiting labour,
contributing to global warming...

04:41.157 --> 04:43.409
Humans think that
they're making one choice

04:43.576 --> 04:45.787
but they're actually making
dozens of choices

04:45.870 --> 04:47.330
they don't even know they're making!

04:48.748 --> 04:52.001
Your big revelation is
"life is complicated?"

04:52.377 --> 04:56.130
That's not a revelation,
that's a divorced woman's throw pillow.

04:56.381 --> 05:00.676
I mean, this guy chose this tomato.
Those are the consequences.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.261
You don't want the consequences?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.597
Do the research, buy another tomato.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.225
- What else you got?
- Um...

05:08.267 --> 05:10.228
I'll tell you what else I got.

05:10.395 --> 05:11.938
Uh, I got this.

05:15.817 --> 05:16.859
Michael?

05:17.235 --> 05:18.277
What... what are you doing?

05:18.778 --> 05:20.405
- Backpack Kid dance.
- Why?

05:20.571 --> 05:23.533
I don't know, it makes people happy?
Is it helping?

05:24.200 --> 05:25.284
Can I say something?

05:26.160 --> 05:29.288
- Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote...
- Boring!

05:30.248 --> 05:31.666
I got this.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.501
- Wh... you--
- I wanna tell you about a guy

05:33.543 --> 05:36.671
from my dance crew in Jacksonville
called "Big Noodle."

05:36.796 --> 05:39.090
Well, we gave it our best shot, guys.
It was nice knowing you.

05:39.257 --> 05:43.428
I used to yell at Big Noodle
cos he always showed up late to rehearsal.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.556
Then one day,
the swamp under my house flooded.

05:46.722 --> 05:50.143
I needed a place to crash,
so I slept at Big Noodle's house.

05:50.393 --> 05:54.439
Turns out that he had to juggle three jobs
to take care of four grandparents

05:54.605 --> 05:57.066
who all lived in the same bed,
just like in "Willy Wonka."

05:57.859 --> 06:00.319
I never yelled at Big Noodle
for being late after that

06:00.486 --> 06:03.156
cos I knew how hard it was
for him to be there.

06:03.739 --> 06:07.034
And he definitely didn't have time
to research what tomatoes to buy

06:07.368 --> 06:10.830
even if he wanted to -
possession of a non-fried vegetable

06:11.205 --> 06:12.707
is a felony in Jacksonville.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.668
The point is, you can't judge humans

06:16.169 --> 06:18.129
cos you don't know what we go through.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.425
Amazingly, Your Honour, he's right.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.845
I didn't really understand people
until I went to Earth.

06:26.179 --> 06:27.680
Maybe you should give it a shot.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.933
If you still don't see things our way,
then we'll drop it

06:31.017 --> 06:32.560
and you can, you know...

06:32.727 --> 06:34.687
zappy-zappy, marble-marble.

06:40.401 --> 06:43.488
Yeah, sure, I'll give it a shot.
I'll go down there.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.531
See what you guys "go through"

06:45.823 --> 06:49.619
and then, one way or another,
this is going to end.

06:50.161 --> 06:52.997
Hey, do you guys know a good place
where I can get Mexican food?

06:53.122 --> 06:54.248
Oh. Pfft!

06:54.373 --> 06:56.292
Mexico. Duh.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.545
Whoa.

06:59.754 --> 07:01.255
Well, how long will she be gone?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.633
No way to tell. Uh, my guess is...

07:03.716 --> 07:05.468
Ohhh, brother!

07:06.052 --> 07:07.887
That was rough!

07:08.221 --> 07:12.141
- Right?
- Sheesh! Earth is a mess, y'all.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.436
Woof! Also, I guess I'm "black"

07:15.686 --> 07:18.231
and they do not like
black ladies down there.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.734
Crap, y'all! This is bad.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.154
Well, where did you go, exactly?

07:25.363 --> 07:29.283
Tanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.785
It's terrible everywhere

07:30.868 --> 07:32.453
and always in a different way!

07:32.787 --> 07:36.249
The only place I liked was Hawaii,
although I barely left the resort.

07:36.457 --> 07:41.796
The last place I went was a Black Friday sale
at an outlet mall in Michigan.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.006
- Why?
- For the deals!

07:44.215 --> 07:45.758
Earth stinks, y'all.

07:45.967 --> 07:51.430
It's hot and it's crowded...
but somehow also cold and lonely?

07:51.722 --> 07:55.309
I thought it was going to be so easy
to make good decisions.

07:55.476 --> 07:59.397
The first thing I did
was I googled "big juicy natural tomatoes"

08:00.022 --> 08:01.816
which led me to a porn site

08:02.358 --> 08:05.319
that was for people
with a sunburn fetish, or...?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.113
I kind of never recovered.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.576
Right. That's problem number one -
life is chaotic and messy and unpredictable.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.788
Problem number two -
even if you do somehow manage

08:15.913 --> 08:20.626
to make good decisions, you still lose points
because of the unintended consequences.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.712
Yeah, there are booby traps everywhere!

08:22.962 --> 08:26.966
Like, there's this chicken sandwich that,
if you eat it, it means you hate gay people!

08:27.341 --> 08:29.969
- And it's delicious!
- It is! It is so good.

08:30.094 --> 08:32.847
And... and I essentially tried
to do what you suggested

08:32.972 --> 08:34.974
I obsessed over every choice.

08:35.099 --> 08:38.811
But that was also bad,
and I still got sent to the Bad Place!

08:39.186 --> 08:40.688
So I'm problem number three.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.024
Oh, no, you are nobody's problem,
sweetheart.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.652
You know, we gotta figure this out.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.573
...and then Turtle makes a bet
with Rhonda Rousey

08:50.615 --> 08:52.450
and if she loses, she has to bo...

08:52.617 --> 08:55.494
Oh, come on! I was just in the middle
of torturing William Shakespeare

08:55.578 --> 08:57.663
by describing the plot
to the Entourage movie.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.540
- What is this?
- Some new information

08:59.582 --> 09:01.959
has come to my attention
and I need a solution.

09:02.043 --> 09:05.838
I want the Bad Place to weigh in on this,
but first, let's have a change of scenery.

09:08.090 --> 09:11.260
Remember, guys,
we're still in the IHOP, so be careful.

09:11.469 --> 09:12.511
Shawn.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.016
I have reason to believe
that humans might be, on average

09:17.475 --> 09:19.852
better than the points system
suggests they are.

09:20.186 --> 09:22.229
Counterpoint - humans are terrible.

09:22.563 --> 09:26.025
Limp Bizkit, slavery...
The prosecution rests.

09:26.192 --> 09:27.985
Gotta say, that's a solid rebuttal.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.404
Look, there are plenty of awful people

09:30.738 --> 09:34.450
and thoughtless jerks,
and I guess Nazis, again, somehow?

09:34.784 --> 09:38.120
But there are also people who are really
trying to be good

09:38.412 --> 09:39.997
and they aren't getting close.

09:40.081 --> 09:43.376
Because they're not good at being good,
because they're bad.

09:43.793 --> 09:48.464
The score they got on Earth is how good
or bad they are, full stop, end of story.

09:48.839 --> 09:52.885
Then why did these four get better,
over and over again, in my Neighbourhood?

09:53.052 --> 09:54.845
Why did they help each other in ways

09:55.012 --> 09:56.764
they had never helped anyone on Earth?

09:57.056 --> 09:58.724
I don't know, maybe it's a fluke.

09:59.058 --> 10:01.268
Plus, you have zero proof
they did get better.

10:01.352 --> 10:03.062
You didn't keep track of their points.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.189
That's it!

10:05.898 --> 10:07.274
I know what we have to do--

10:07.900 --> 10:09.944
Oh! He forgot we're still in the IHOP.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.529
Anybody got eyes on Chidi?

10:11.862 --> 10:12.988
Help.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.199
Help!

10:15.825 --> 10:18.077
Can someone grab my tiny boyfriend, please?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.328
I'm on it.

10:19.412 --> 10:21.330
And... got him! Ah.

10:21.664 --> 10:22.581
- Here you go.
- Urgh!

10:22.707 --> 10:23.624
Ah-ha!

10:26.210 --> 10:29.755
I... I just saw
a trillion different realities

10:30.005 --> 10:35.052
folding onto each other like thin sheets
of metal, forming a single blade...

10:35.219 --> 10:37.263
Yeah, yeah, the Time Knife,
we've all seen it.

10:37.513 --> 10:38.931
Let's get back on track, bud.

10:39.098 --> 10:43.185
Yeah, OK. Sure. What I was saying,
um, before, you know...

10:43.519 --> 10:45.271
I saw the "Time Knife"!

10:46.939 --> 10:49.859
...is this, Michael is right.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.988
His Neighbourhood gave us the chance
to become better people

10:54.071 --> 10:57.742
because it removed all the variables
that make life on Earth hard.

10:58.117 --> 11:02.246
Yeah. Uh, there was no rent to pay,
no racism, no sexism...

11:02.413 --> 11:06.041
No awards-show
gift-suite publicist in-fighting.

11:07.418 --> 11:10.004
What?
Those gift-suites can be a real minefield.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.715
But, Shawn is also right.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.593
And the four of us becoming
better people could be a fluke.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.137
So, let's repeat the experiment.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.474
It's what Simone taught us
about data collection.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.934
Try it again,
and see if you get the same results.

11:24.059 --> 11:28.230
Of course! I build a new Neighbourhood,
we choose four new people

11:28.314 --> 11:31.192
tell them they're in the Good Place,
create challenges for them

11:31.525 --> 11:32.902
track their progress.

11:33.027 --> 11:35.863
My guess is they will do
what the original four did

11:36.113 --> 11:40.075
seek help, support each other,
make wise decisions, improve.

11:40.409 --> 11:46.081
If they do, then it's proof that humans
are not "bad, full stop, end of story."

11:46.749 --> 11:49.001
This is so stupid.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.961
Where would you even
put this Neighbourhood?

11:51.086 --> 11:53.214
I wouldn't allow it to be built
in the Good Place, that's for sure

11:53.380 --> 11:55.716
and I doubt you'd want to come back
to my neck of the woods...

11:56.133 --> 11:59.136
Ooh! I have an idea.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.725
Hi, Mindy. We need to use your backyard.

12:07.061 --> 12:09.522
You need my backyard? For what?

12:09.688 --> 12:11.524
We're conducting an important experi--

12:11.565 --> 12:12.733
You know what? I don't care.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.027
In fact, as soon as I started
asking the question

12:15.110 --> 12:16.987
I thought to myself,
"Why are you asking this?

12:17.112 --> 12:18.447
You don't care about the answer."

12:18.614 --> 12:20.658
Do whatever you want,
just leave me out of it.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.536
And if you want to talk to someone,
talk to Derek.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.996
I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

12:28.499 --> 12:29.667
Who's Derek?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.962
Don't think of Derek as my ex-boyfriend.

12:33.462 --> 12:36.340
I made him, so he's more like my son.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.260
Although, I did make him because
I was jealous of you and Tahani

12:39.343 --> 12:41.637
so he's kind of my rebound booty-call.

12:41.846 --> 12:44.682
So... he's your son-rebound-booty-call?

12:45.015 --> 12:48.435
Fine, if you want to put labels on it,
I guess he's my son-rebound-booty-call.

12:49.228 --> 12:51.105
But he doesn't mean anything to me.

12:51.981 --> 12:53.691
Also, Derek never really...

12:54.483 --> 12:56.443
worked right. He's a buffoon.

12:56.569 --> 12:58.070
You have nothing to worry about.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.531
"How should he love thee?

13:00.573 --> 13:01.949
Or how deem thee wise?

13:02.241 --> 13:03.993
Who wouldst not leave him

13:04.243 --> 13:05.536
In his wandering?"

13:07.162 --> 13:09.123
Oh. I didn't see you there.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.542
I was just reciting some Edgar Allan Poe.

13:12.001 --> 13:13.419
Hi, I'm Derek.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.588
Welcome to the Medium Place.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.384
Derek! Why are... you so different?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.136
You have Mindy to thank for that.

13:22.595 --> 13:25.764
See, she found a plunger sticking out
of the ground behind our house

13:25.848 --> 13:28.142
and every time she hits it, I pass out.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.812
When I come to, I'm a little bit smarter
and a little bit better.

13:31.896 --> 13:32.938
Not to brag

13:33.063 --> 13:35.107
but I almost have a full-grown penis now.

13:35.274 --> 13:37.818
It's resplendent, and mostly functional.

13:37.943 --> 13:41.071
- How many times has Mindy rebooted you?
- I don't know. Half a million?

13:41.530 --> 13:43.198
- What?
- She reboots me a lot.

13:43.365 --> 13:46.535
Sometimes when she's bored,
or just needs some "alone time"

13:46.869 --> 13:48.120
sometimes just for laughs.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.083
Derek... Shall we head inside?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.627
- OK.
- Cool.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.212
So, here are the rules.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.840
Michael designs the new Neighbourhood
however he wants.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.760
The Bad Place gets to choose
the four new humans

14:03.218 --> 14:07.556
but they have to be the same general level
of badness as the original four.

14:07.765 --> 14:11.477
Alright? No serial killers, no dictators,
no one who managed a boy band.

14:12.102 --> 14:15.064
Michael will not get the files in advance

14:15.189 --> 14:17.024
so he does not have forever to plan

14:17.107 --> 14:21.695
but he can then change the Neighbourhood
however he wants.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.614
Yeah, I have about a billion objections
to this.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.408
- So do I.
- Good! That means it's a fair compromise.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.786
So, one last issue.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.330
Where do we get all the other residents
for this place?

14:31.497 --> 14:36.043
Well, my original Neighbourhood was
built for torture so everyone was a demon

14:36.335 --> 14:39.088
we can't have that.
I say we get them from the Good Place.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.423
Over my dead skin-suit.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.258
Well, what other option do we have?

14:43.509 --> 14:46.470
Would anybody like a Medium snack?

14:46.762 --> 14:50.015
I myself will be enjoying another
classy martini.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.475
Don't mind if I do.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.769
I can make the people.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.230
- Just like I made Derek.
- Are you sure?

14:56.313 --> 14:59.608
Yes. If the Judge restores my powers
in the Medium Place, I can do it.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.361
They'll be way more advanced
than the original Derek. No offense.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.445
None taken.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.408
OK. The other residents will be comprised
of "Janet babies."

15:07.992 --> 15:11.745
You will have one year of Earth time
to try to improve the humans.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.748
I will be monitoring everything
to ensure there's no cheating

15:14.832 --> 15:17.209
and to track the humans' progress. Deal?

15:20.087 --> 15:21.755
Ah! Gah! Ow!

15:21.839 --> 15:24.591
Classic.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.635
Ha-ha! Ow!

15:31.932 --> 15:33.434
- Janet?
- Hi there!

15:33.684 --> 15:34.977
- Ah.
- Ready to start building?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.478
- Yes.
- I have some ideas

15:36.562 --> 15:38.856
for how to design
a sort of "basic" Neighbourhood

15:38.897 --> 15:41.859
which we can then tailor to the guests
as we learn more about them.

15:42.026 --> 15:45.404
- Now, when you say, um... "some" ideas?
- I have 11 trillion ideas.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.740
Yes. I'm so glad you're here, Janet.

15:47.865 --> 15:48.907
Me too.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.452
Alright. So...

15:51.702 --> 15:54.038
What's your first "basic" idea?

15:57.916 --> 16:00.461
Perfect. So "basic."

16:07.843 --> 16:10.429
This house was built to torture you.

16:10.763 --> 16:13.432
Why did you have Michael
recreate it exactly?

16:13.724 --> 16:17.186
Well, in the memories I watched,
this was where we fell in love.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.938
So I figured, why mess with success?

16:21.190 --> 16:22.649
I mean, bleugh! What am I saying?

16:22.733 --> 16:25.152
This house is stupid and you're lame,
and I hate you.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.361
I love you too.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.364
This is gonna be fun.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.451
I mean, I know we have to help
these new people

16:32.534 --> 16:36.371
but most of the time we'll just get
to live together, like a normal couple.

16:37.081 --> 16:39.792
We can chill out, and just relax, and...

16:40.209 --> 16:42.169
- Have sex...
- ...study philosophy.

16:42.878 --> 16:44.671
- Horndog!
- Nerd!

16:52.054 --> 16:54.640
- Hi! I'm Daphne.
- Hi, Daphne. I'm Janet.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.350
- I made you.
- Great.

16:56.517 --> 16:57.684
I'll wait for your instructions.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.436
Thank you for making me! Bye!

16:59.978 --> 17:01.396
OK, Daphne's done.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.816
Only another 185 people to go.

17:04.274 --> 17:05.526
I'll check back in an hour.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.529
You're doing so good, Janet.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.115
Thanks, Jason. Making people is exhausting.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.200
Can't help but notice

17:13.283 --> 17:15.119
you're making a bunch of people.

17:15.828 --> 17:17.371
You know, if we pooled our resources

17:17.412 --> 17:19.873
we could be done in two shakes
of a lamb's Derek.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.292
Whatever.
Janet doesn't need your help, dude!

17:22.417 --> 17:25.504
Actually, it would go a lot faster.
Thanks, Derek.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.297
No problem.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.675
Don't worry,
this is purely professional, OK?

17:29.800 --> 17:34.721
Now be a pal and hold my classy martini,
while I get down to business.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.348
Let's make people.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.981
Hello, Your Honour...

17:44.064 --> 17:46.441
You fell for it! It's me, Shawn.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.569
Just wanted to wish you bad luck.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.405
Trying to psyche me out?
You must be scared.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.781
Oh, I'm very confident.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.784
I think we've picked some excellent
subjects for your stupid experiment.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.327
When you fail, and you will...

17:57.870 --> 18:00.664
I've got something special cooked up
for your four little friends.

18:00.747 --> 18:05.502
Let me guess, they're gonna be tortured
with penis flatteners, and bees with teeth...

18:05.586 --> 18:07.045
you are so predictable.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.590
Why don't you at least switch it up
once in a while?

18:09.715 --> 18:12.259
Try using teeth flatteners

18:12.467 --> 18:14.136
and bees with penises?

18:14.469 --> 18:16.388
First of all, that's... stupid.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.515
But also, we are switching it up.

18:18.599 --> 18:21.476
When you fail, the four humans
will be tortured for all eternity.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.770
But guess who's going to be doing
the torturing?

18:24.438 --> 18:25.564
Hello, idiot!

18:27.316 --> 18:28.650
We built a Michael suit!

18:28.775 --> 18:30.652
The boys down in R&D
said it couldn't be done

18:30.861 --> 18:32.112
so I made it out of them.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.032
That's Vicky in there right now,
taking you for a spin.

18:35.199 --> 18:38.660
You are disgusting. Dis-gus-ting-uh!

18:38.994 --> 18:42.372
Oh, Michael. It's going to be so amazing,
watching your four BFFs

18:42.456 --> 18:46.960
look so sad and betrayed and confused,
as you, their reformed demon daddy

18:47.169 --> 18:48.587
unleash a swarm of...

18:49.463 --> 18:51.673
penis-bees. I invented those.

18:52.049 --> 18:52.925
That was me.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.636
Well, I will just tell them
what you're going to do

18:55.719 --> 18:57.471
and they'll know that it isn't really me.

18:57.638 --> 18:59.806
And we'll erase their memories
of you telling them.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.893
Thanks for inventing that little trick,
by the way - very useful.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.061
Have fun, Michael.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.773
Enjoy everything
that is about to overwhelm you.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.067
Mmm-bye, bitch!

19:18.492 --> 19:21.328
So... how bad is contestant number one?

19:21.787 --> 19:23.830
Murderer? War criminal?

19:23.956 --> 19:24.957
Instagram DJ?

19:25.999 --> 19:27.209
Uh, yeah, um...

19:27.292 --> 19:30.170
- Are you OK?
- Mm-hmm. Yep, just a little jittery.

19:30.545 --> 19:35.008
Last time I designed a Neighbourhood,
things didn't really go according to plan.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.593
Neh. Plans are for wimps.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.804
- Mm.
- We should've done this Shellstrop-style

19:38.929 --> 19:41.390
don't prepare at all,
get drunk the morning of the test

19:41.682 --> 19:44.935
BS our way through it, and then brag
about how we didn't even study

19:45.018 --> 19:47.896
and still got a C plus!

19:47.980 --> 19:50.774
So what do we got, man?
I gotta go give everyone a heads-up, remember?

19:50.816 --> 19:53.652
Uh, his name is John.
Um, some sort of journalist.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.154
No major crimes or atrocities...

19:56.613 --> 19:58.282
- Is he out there right now?
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.540
Wow. That's freaky.

20:06.623 --> 20:11.169
So, based on initial skimming of his file,
we will run scenario...

20:11.295 --> 20:13.463
G48-119...

20:13.547 --> 20:14.965
- Geez Louise.
- Well...

20:15.340 --> 20:16.800
you have to be prepared for anything.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.844
I mean, is John coming in thinking
that he belongs

20:18.885 --> 20:20.804
or does he know he definitely doesn't?

20:20.929 --> 20:22.472
Dude, dude... Relax.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.767
All we have to do today is tell John
he's in the Good Place

20:26.226 --> 20:28.895
show him around the Neighbourhood,
and get him to Tahani's welcome party.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.565
That's it. We can deal with the rest later,
right?

20:31.982 --> 20:33.650
- Right. Right, right, right...
- Hey.

20:33.734 --> 20:37.195
Listen. Whatever your plan is,
it's gonna be great.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.739
We trust you.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.825
Your friends will always trust you.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.956
OK. Here I go.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.333
OK. I'm gonna...

20:50.459 --> 20:52.461
Yup. Here I go.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.883
I go here and...

20:59.009 --> 21:00.260
I'm gone.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.679
- Michael?
- Oh, yeah, I'm gone...

21:02.763 --> 21:05.057
- Oh, whoa.
- I can't do this!

21:05.223 --> 21:06.350
Hello?

21:07.017 --> 21:08.393
- Is anyone here?
- Michael, buddy!

21:08.518 --> 21:10.645
John is awake.
We need to open the door...

21:10.771 --> 21:12.773
- Mm-hmm...
- And welcome him into the afterlife?

21:12.981 --> 21:14.232
Remember? The whole plan?

21:14.816 --> 21:15.942
I do remember.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.862
That's why I can't do it.
It's too... too scary.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.114
Oh...

21:21.656 --> 21:22.616
No!

21:22.699 --> 21:24.326
Hello?
