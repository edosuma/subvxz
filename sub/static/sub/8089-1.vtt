00:49.400 --> 00:53.973
Listen to me! Killing a few hostages
is not sufficient!

00:54.120 --> 00:56.681
The Americans must be made to suffer.

00:56.929 --> 00:59.101
We must humiliate them.

00:59.205 --> 01:01.586
You do not go far enough,
General Amin.

01:01.799 --> 01:05.651
We must strip their entrails out
and drag them to Damascus,

01:05.818 --> 01:09.572
until they include us
in the peace process.

01:09.676 --> 01:14.303
Nonsense! This solution
is not bold enough for Libya.

01:14.516 --> 01:18.291
I say wipe out Washington
and New York.

01:18.395 --> 01:22.081
What? And spoil
three years of good PR?

01:22.186 --> 01:25.277
The Americans believe I'm a nice guy.

01:25.483 --> 01:29.688
In some of their polls, I'm more
popular than their president!

01:32.150 --> 01:36.601
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
This is getting us nowhere.

01:36.888 --> 01:40.020
If we do nothing else this week,

01:40.124 --> 01:43.940
we must conceive
at least one terrorist act

01:44.044 --> 01:46.861
that will show all the world

01:46.966 --> 01:49.948
that the United States,
the great Satan,

01:50.052 --> 01:53.200
is but a paper tiger - a weak nation,

01:53.304 --> 01:58.080
a weak people,
a people ripe for destruction.

01:58.184 --> 02:01.758
Cowards, no longer willing to fight.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.115
I knew it!

03:00.821 --> 03:03.351
Hey, who are you?

03:03.456 --> 03:06.018
I'm Lieutenant Frank Drebin,
Police Squad.

03:06.122 --> 03:09.368
And don't ever
let me catch you guys in America!

03:37.441 --> 03:39.480
Watch out!

05:41.939 --> 05:44.637
...98, 99, 100. It's all here.

05:44.741 --> 05:47.931
This completes
our first shipment of heroin.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.114
100% pure.

05:50.239 --> 05:52.476
It better be - all 40 kilos.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.982
The final shipment
will be delivered in three days.

05:56.087 --> 05:59.613
- Then we'll expect payment.
- Don't worry.'

06:27.943 --> 06:30.481
Police! Throw down your guns!

06:53.052 --> 06:54.929
Kill him.

07:43.059 --> 07:47.638
It's a great day for Americans.
This man alone...

07:56.698 --> 07:58.192
There he is!

07:59.326 --> 08:01.357
No flowers, thank you.

08:01.461 --> 08:05.066
Welcome home, Frank. Good work
in Beirut. We heard about it.

08:05.170 --> 08:09.282
Thanks. I want to know one thing -
is it true about Victoria?

08:09.387 --> 08:12.990
I'm afraid so.
She ran off with some guy.

08:13.094 --> 08:15.659
They got married last week.

08:15.763 --> 08:19.415
Then it's over.
All of this is meaningless.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.292
I did it for her. Everything.

08:22.397 --> 08:24.876
And now she's gone.

08:24.980 --> 08:29.132
And you came down here
to get a hot story, didn't you?

08:29.237 --> 08:31.761
Pictures of me
to sell your newspapers.

08:31.865 --> 08:35.597
- Frank...
- Sure, you think I'm a big hero.

08:35.703 --> 08:40.229
Do any of you understand
how a man can hurt inside?

08:40.332 --> 08:42.438
Frank, they're not here for you.

08:42.544 --> 08:45.026
"Weird Al" Yankovic is on the plane.

08:50.543 --> 08:53.323
What about the wedding?
What was she wearing?

08:53.428 --> 08:56.829
Don't torture yourself!
Put her out of your mind.

08:56.933 --> 09:00.582
I can't get her out of my mind.
What about the guy?

09:00.686 --> 09:03.919
- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.

09:04.024 --> 09:06.168
Just that he's an Olympic gymnast

09:06.273 --> 09:08.936
and it's the best sex she's ever had.

09:10.145 --> 09:14.635
I trusted her and followed my heart.
Foolishly, it seems.

09:14.740 --> 09:17.347
I'm just gonna have
to learn to forget.

09:17.452 --> 09:22.561
That's why I took my vacation
in Beirut - to find some peace.

09:22.665 --> 09:24.689
It won't be easy.

09:24.793 --> 09:28.201
Everywhere I look,
something reminds me of her.

09:29.790 --> 09:32.987
Maybe cops and women just don't mix.

09:33.091 --> 09:36.493
What about Nordberg?
I came as soon as I heard.

09:36.597 --> 09:38.952
He's alive, but on life support.

09:39.057 --> 09:41.747
He's got a 50/50 chance of living,

09:41.851 --> 09:45.972
though there's only
a 10% chance of that.

10:08.078 --> 10:12.024
Mrs Nordberg, I think
we can save your husband's arm.

10:12.128 --> 10:14.155
Where would you like it sent?

10:14.259 --> 10:19.368
- Frank! I'm so glad you came!
- Wilma, I came as soon as I heard.

10:19.472 --> 10:21.118
Thank you, Frank.

10:21.223 --> 10:24.374
- Where's Nordberg?
- He's right here.

10:24.478 --> 10:27.969
Nordberg, it's Frank, your buddy.

10:30.309 --> 10:32.348
I'll get it!

10:35.856 --> 10:38.940
Get the switch
at the back of the bed!

10:41.987 --> 10:46.604
Nordberg, it's me, Frank.
Who did this to you?

10:46.709 --> 10:48.693
I... love you.

10:49.953 --> 10:53.899
I love you, too, Nordberg.
Who were they?

10:54.003 --> 10:57.656
- Ship... Boat...
- That's right. A boat.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.994
When you're better,
we'll go sailing together,

11:01.098 --> 11:03.869
- just like last year.
- No... Drugs.

11:03.974 --> 11:08.374
Nurse, give this man some drugs!
Can't you see he's in pain?

11:08.478 --> 11:10.919
- Give him a shot, quickly!
- No...

11:11.024 --> 11:14.212
Heroin! Heroin, Frank!

11:14.316 --> 11:16.591
Nordberg, that's a pretty tall order.

11:16.695 --> 11:19.854
Give me a couple of days
on that one.

11:22.110 --> 11:26.433
Oh, my poor Nordberg!
He was such a good man, Frank.

11:26.537 --> 11:30.899
He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?

11:31.003 --> 11:32.647
It's hard to tell.

11:32.752 --> 11:37.787
A gang of thugs, a blackmailer,
an angry husband, a gay lover...

11:39.544 --> 11:42.074
Frank, get a hold of yourself!

11:42.179 --> 11:47.121
A good cop - needlessly cut down
by some cowardly hoodlums.

11:47.225 --> 11:50.709
- No way for a man to die.
- You're right, Ed.

11:50.813 --> 11:53.713
A parachute not opening -
that's the way to die,

11:53.817 --> 11:56.255
getting caught in a combine,

11:56.360 --> 11:58.966
having your nuts bit off
by a Laplander.

11:59.071 --> 12:01.103
That's the way I want to go.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.723
Frank! This is terrible!

12:05.827 --> 12:11.148
Don't worry, Wilma.
Your husband is gonna be all right.

12:11.253 --> 12:16.275
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.359
He's right, Wilma,

12:18.463 --> 12:23.364
but don't wait till the last minute
to fill out those organ donor cards.

12:23.468 --> 12:27.158
What I'm trying to say is,
as soon as Nordberg is better,

12:27.262 --> 12:29.411
he's welcome back at Police Squad.

12:29.516 --> 12:34.552
Unless he's a drooling vegetable,
but that's only common sense.

12:36.809 --> 12:40.937
Do you know why Nordberg
was at the waterfront?

12:42.482 --> 12:43.524
No...

12:44.817 --> 12:48.021
But I found this at home in a drawer.

12:49.197 --> 12:55.645
A photograph!
"I Luv You" out of Caracas.

12:55.749 --> 12:58.404
A Panamanian ship.

12:58.508 --> 13:02.699
When he said "I love you", he was
telling you the name of the ship!

13:02.803 --> 13:05.869
I realise that... now.

13:05.973 --> 13:09.742
- We'd better check this out.
- I want every available man on it.

13:09.847 --> 13:11.912
I can't spare anybody.

13:12.016 --> 13:16.129
We're in charge of security
for Queen Elizabeth's visit.

13:16.233 --> 13:18.882
Wilma, whatever scum did this,

13:18.986 --> 13:23.472
no man will rest until he's behind
bars. Let's grab a bite to eat.

13:28.944 --> 13:33.850
Due to the extraordinary efforts
of some of our civic leaders,

13:33.954 --> 13:38.733
Queen Elizabeth has included
the city of Los Angeles

13:38.837 --> 13:42.992
as one of the cities she'll visit
during her American tour.

13:44.418 --> 13:48.741
Will the city hire
additional security officers?

13:48.845 --> 13:53.994
We have placed the Queen's security
in the hands of Police Squad,

13:54.098 --> 13:57.207
a special division
of the Police Department,

13:57.312 --> 14:00.390
represented here
by Lieutenant Frank Drebin.

14:04.354 --> 14:06.394
Thank you, Your Honour.

14:08.275 --> 14:09.318
Louder!

14:11.361 --> 14:14.446
- You can use my radio mic.
- Thank you.

14:21.121 --> 14:24.900
Thank you, Your Honour.
Protecting the Queen's safety

14:25.004 --> 14:29.240
is a task that is gladly accepted
by Police Squad.

14:29.344 --> 14:33.410
No matter how silly the idea
of having a queen might be to us,

14:33.515 --> 14:38.503
as Americans we must be gracious
and considerate hosts.

14:40.474 --> 14:42.347
Thank you, Lieutenant Drebin.

14:43.685 --> 14:48.175
Of course, we all have a stake
in seeing that this portion

14:48.279 --> 14:52.890
of the Queen's American tour
is completely protected.

14:52.995 --> 14:57.814
And we can take pride
that the Queen...

15:02.579 --> 15:05.858
Indeed, it is for all the people,

15:05.963 --> 15:11.200
who will be able to share
in these... celebrations...

15:13.382 --> 15:15.670
Especially exciting...

15:17.344 --> 15:22.586
will be... the Queen's...
public appearances.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.403
We also would like...

15:58.843 --> 16:03.710
Ed and I drove to where Nordberg
had been found floating.

16:03.814 --> 16:08.839
Without leads, you have to start
somewhere, and that was the harbour.

16:08.943 --> 16:12.215
Please disperse. Please disperse.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.638
There's nothing for you to see here.
Keep moving.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.556
Where did they find him?

16:18.660 --> 16:20.724
Out there.
Do you wanna take a dinghy?

16:20.828 --> 16:24.020
No, I took care of that
at the press conference.

16:24.124 --> 16:27.397
It doesn't make sense.
Good policeman, bright future...

16:27.502 --> 16:29.816
then something like this happens.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.947
He was found by the nightwatchman.

16:32.051 --> 16:34.784
I'm gonna talk to the harbour-master.

16:34.888 --> 16:36.918
I'll walk around and snoop.

16:42.511 --> 16:46.207
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant Drebin, Police Squad.

16:46.311 --> 16:48.876
I remember you. What do you want?

16:48.980 --> 16:52.672
I wanna ask some questions.
Are you familiar with that face?

16:52.776 --> 16:56.134
I don't know.
My memory ain't so great.

16:56.239 --> 16:59.225
Oh, yeah?
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.

16:59.329 --> 17:01.351
- Still hazy.
- How about this?

17:01.455 --> 17:03.600
I remember. Why do you want to know?

17:03.704 --> 17:07.229
- I can't tell you.
- Maybe this'll help.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.857
- I don't think I should.
- Still don't think so?

17:10.962 --> 17:14.446
- It's Nordberg, he's a cop.
- No, he was dealin' 'H'.

17:14.551 --> 17:16.281
- What?
- He was dirty!

17:16.385 --> 17:19.287
Scum! I ought to
run you in right now!

17:19.391 --> 17:22.911
He worked at Ludwig's Shipping.
He tried to push something.

17:23.015 --> 17:26.333
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Why should I tell you?

17:26.438 --> 17:29.587
- Maybe this'll help.
- I shouldn't tell you.

17:29.691 --> 17:32.130
Can you spot me a 20? How about now?

17:32.234 --> 17:34.380
I'm going down to Ludwig's office.

17:34.484 --> 17:37.100
I'll find out
if you're telling the truth.

17:39.150 --> 17:43.268
Vincent Ludwig owned one
of the city's largest corporations.

17:43.372 --> 17:45.932
A respected business man
and civic leader,

17:46.036 --> 17:49.229
he was to chair the Queen's reception
committee.

17:49.333 --> 17:53.574
Now I was about to question him about
drugs and attempted murder.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.576
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

18:02.680 --> 18:05.628
Lieutenant Drebin to see you, sir.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.056
Show him in.

18:14.519 --> 18:17.594
- Lieutenant.
- The feeling is mutual.

18:17.698 --> 18:21.468
Nice to meet you, too. Cuban?

18:21.572 --> 18:26.058
No, Dutch-Irish.
My father was from Wales.

18:26.162 --> 18:27.687
Sit down.

18:27.792 --> 18:31.023
- What a magnificent office.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

18:31.127 --> 18:35.653
Most objects I have collected
over a period of many years -

18:35.757 --> 18:40.449
my Gainsborough, Ming vases.
Priceless!

18:40.553 --> 18:45.495
They are objects which I feel
reflect my personality,

18:45.599 --> 18:47.790
like the Japanese fighting fish -

18:47.894 --> 18:50.916
beautiful, graceful, elegant...

18:51.020 --> 18:53.250
yet single-minded of purpose

18:53.355 --> 18:57.006
and deadly when it finds
what it wants.

18:57.111 --> 19:02.220
This particular one
is valued at over $20,000.

19:02.324 --> 19:04.931
A luxury item, to be certain,

19:05.035 --> 19:08.935
but I am a man who appreciates
the finer things in life.

19:09.039 --> 19:13.105
Oh, this...
This is a rare Samurai pen,

19:13.209 --> 19:16.111
a gift from Emperor Hirohito.

19:16.215 --> 19:20.240
Unbreakable.
Impervious to everything but water.

19:20.344 --> 19:25.202
- Its value is beyond estimation.
- That's fascinating.

19:25.307 --> 19:30.247
But I'm sure you didn't pay this
visit for a lecture on fine art.

19:30.351 --> 19:33.003
To what do I owe the honour?

19:33.107 --> 19:36.929
I'm investigating the attempted
murder of a dock worker,

19:38.602 --> 19:42.351
a man named Nordberg,
a police officer.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.264
He is still alive, then?

19:46.368 --> 19:48.732
He was shot six times.

19:48.988 --> 19:52.062
Fortunately, the bullets missed
every vital organ.

19:52.167 --> 19:55.853
- The salt water preserved him.
- So they...

19:55.957 --> 19:58.439
So they got him
to the hospital in time?

19:58.543 --> 20:02.529
He's in the intensive care ward
at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.

20:02.633 --> 20:05.867
This certainly comes
as a shock to me.

20:05.971 --> 20:11.201
As you know, I'm not the kind of man
who takes such things lightly.

20:11.306 --> 20:15.209
There is no room in my organisation
for criminal activity.

20:15.313 --> 20:19.712
Look out there - a vast
commercial development built by me.

20:19.816 --> 20:23.890
Do you have any idea what was
out there just five years ago?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.427
You bet you do. Orange groves!

20:27.531 --> 20:30.601
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.

20:30.705 --> 20:35.572
But now that land will generate
ten times the amount of profit.

20:36.994 --> 20:39.563
Are you all right, Lieutenant?

20:39.667 --> 20:41.983
Let me get you some Kleenex.

20:42.087 --> 20:45.528
Has this officer -

20:45.633 --> 20:47.742
What's his name? Nordberg -

20:47.846 --> 20:51.872
been able to tell you anything?

20:51.977 --> 20:56.457
Well, he hasn't been able
to tell us a thing so far,

20:56.561 --> 20:59.463
but as soon as
he regains consciousness,

20:59.567 --> 21:03.676
we'll see if he
can still play the guitar.

21:03.780 --> 21:07.217
- Pardon?
- I've taken up a lot of your time.

21:07.321 --> 21:09.930
I'd like to look
at your employment records

21:10.034 --> 21:12.474
and speak to someone in Personnel.

21:12.578 --> 21:14.141
Of course.

21:14.246 --> 21:17.935
- Dominique, send in Miss Spencer.
- Yes, sir.

21:18.039 --> 21:22.735
I am quite busy making arrangements
for the royal visit,

21:22.840 --> 21:26.738
but I will have my assistant
provide you with anything you need.

21:26.843 --> 21:30.198
You've been very co-operative.
I'll note that in my report.

21:30.302 --> 21:32.124
My pleasure.

21:35.051 --> 21:39.594
Miss Spencer! This is
Lieutenant Drebin from Police Squad.

21:40.682 --> 21:43.220
Hello... Mr Drebin.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.311
Hello.

21:52.860 --> 21:53.903
Oh!

22:09.043 --> 22:13.207
Her hair was the colour
of gold in old paintings.

22:14.382 --> 22:17.539
She had a full set of curves

22:17.644 --> 22:22.419
and the kind of legs
you'd like to suck on for a day.

22:22.523 --> 22:26.216
She gave me a look
I could feel in my hip pocket.

22:27.895 --> 22:32.142
Yep, this was starting
to get interesting.

22:37.864 --> 22:41.355
- Nice beaver.
- Thank you.

22:41.459 --> 22:45.448
- I just had it stuffed.
- Let me help you with that.

22:47.457 --> 22:50.532
This should be
what you're looking for -

22:50.636 --> 22:53.368
the shipping and employment records
for Pier 32.

22:53.472 --> 22:55.548
Thank you.

22:56.174 --> 22:58.704
I've heard police work is dangerous.

22:58.809 --> 23:01.127
Yes, that's why I carry a big gun.

23:01.679 --> 23:04.043
Couldn't it go off accidentally?

23:04.147 --> 23:06.420
I used to have that problem.

23:06.525 --> 23:08.549
What did you do about it?

23:08.653 --> 23:11.136
I just think about baseball.

23:12.940 --> 23:16.220
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet
you have there.

23:16.324 --> 23:19.099
Did it slip down there again?

23:19.203 --> 23:22.060
Yes, well...
I'll quickly go through these

23:22.164 --> 23:24.189
and get them back to you tomorrow.

23:24.293 --> 23:28.941
Fine, but there's no rush.
I mean, whenever you're through.

23:29.045 --> 23:33.196
Thank you. I wish there was
some way I could repay you.

23:33.300 --> 23:38.494
How about dinner? I know a place
that serves great Viking food.

23:38.598 --> 23:42.708
It's tempting, but I'm afraid
I must rest this evening,

23:42.812 --> 23:44.834
tomorrow being Arbor Day.

23:44.938 --> 23:47.793
Of course. Perhaps some other time.

23:47.897 --> 23:51.466
- How about a rain check?
- Let's just stick to dinner.

23:51.570 --> 23:55.180
Thank you for your help,
Miss Spencer.

23:56.525 --> 23:58.556
My pleasure.

23:58.660 --> 24:02.309
- Well?
- Mr Ludwig, you startled me!

24:02.413 --> 24:04.270
I'm sorry, my dear.

24:04.374 --> 24:07.523
Did you give the lieutenant
what he wanted?

24:07.627 --> 24:10.188
I gave him copies of the files
for Pier 32.

24:10.293 --> 24:12.320
Good. That's good.

24:12.424 --> 24:17.405
He is an intriguing fellow,
don't you think?

24:17.509 --> 24:21.494
Well, I don't know.
I've only just met him.

24:21.599 --> 24:23.456
He seems very nice.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.749
Jane, I realise
this is an unusual request,

24:26.853 --> 24:30.171
but if there is something illegal
going on in this company,

24:30.275 --> 24:34.046
I need to know about it,
so we can root it out.

24:34.150 --> 24:36.215
That's why I want you to...

24:36.320 --> 24:40.554
well, to get to know Drebin
a little better,

24:40.658 --> 24:42.683
find out what he knows.

24:42.788 --> 24:45.559
Wouldn't this be best handled
by the police?

24:45.663 --> 24:48.981
We are letting the police handle it,
my dear!

24:49.086 --> 24:52.152
But we need to know
the facts quickly

24:52.257 --> 24:55.361
before anything
gets into the newspapers.

24:55.465 --> 24:59.910
Don't forget, I have a responsibility
to the stockholders.

25:00.014 --> 25:03.534
Well... if you put it that way...

25:03.639 --> 25:07.548
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- That's better.

25:10.599 --> 25:13.516
I'm sure you will.

25:18.774 --> 25:23.097
It was about 4pm
when I returned to Police Squad.

25:23.201 --> 25:27.812
I wanted to see what the lab had
come up with on Nordberg's jacket,

25:27.916 --> 25:30.355
the one they'd found on the docks.

25:30.459 --> 25:34.147
You can tell a lot from fibre
samples if they aren't too wet.

25:34.252 --> 25:36.817
I was hoping we wouldn't
come up dry.

25:36.921 --> 25:38.541
Hey, look out!

25:40.796 --> 25:42.539
Police! Halt!

25:51.472 --> 25:54.343
Anybody catch the licence plate?

25:54.767 --> 25:57.851
Anybody get a look at the driver?

26:01.273 --> 26:04.553
Take the names of everybody here
for questioning.

26:04.657 --> 26:08.436
I've got to get... inside.

26:15.204 --> 26:18.567
Hi, Ed, Ted. You got
those fibre samples yet?

26:18.671 --> 26:20.736
- We got some action here.
- What?

26:20.840 --> 26:23.282
We're testing our anti-graffiti wall.

26:23.386 --> 26:25.243
We've got customers.

26:25.348 --> 26:29.040
It reacts when
the spray hits the sensors.

26:32.305 --> 26:34.541
You've done it again - mazel tov!

26:34.645 --> 26:37.420
Good work.
What will you think of next?

26:37.524 --> 26:39.549
Now that you mention it,

26:39.654 --> 26:42.508
here's something
we developed only yesterday.

26:42.613 --> 26:45.431
To the casual observer -
an ordinary shoe.

26:45.535 --> 26:49.433
But in actuality...
it makes a handy weapon.

26:49.537 --> 26:52.771
And everything a cop would need.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.937
We call it the Swiss Army Shoe.

26:55.041 --> 26:59.608
- Great. And the fibre samples?
- Just one more thing.

26:59.712 --> 27:01.987
See these cufflinks I'm wearing?

27:02.092 --> 27:06.740
They're not just cufflinks. Each one
fires a single pin-sized dart,

27:06.844 --> 27:09.914
that knocks out your victim
for a few minutes.

27:10.018 --> 27:12.251
Let me demonstrate on Ed.

27:14.221 --> 27:16.098
Ted! Why?

27:18.851 --> 27:21.926
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.

27:22.030 --> 27:26.139
- Why don't you take a pair?
- Actually, I could use another pair.

27:26.243 --> 27:28.098
I think you'll like them.

27:28.202 --> 27:30.935
- Want this, chief?
- Thank you, Al.

27:31.039 --> 27:34.105
There's something
on the side of your mouth, Al.

27:34.209 --> 27:36.730
No, no. The other side.

27:36.835 --> 27:41.528
As you requested, we took some
fibre samples from Nordberg's jacket.

27:41.632 --> 27:44.026
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.

27:44.131 --> 27:47.626
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.

27:50.215 --> 27:54.129
- I can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.

27:54.844 --> 27:56.876
Yeah, I can see it now.

27:56.980 --> 28:00.546
At first, it appears
to be the normal cotton fibres.

28:00.650 --> 28:03.347
But we discovered
a fine white powder.

28:04.854 --> 28:07.174
Pure heroin.

28:07.279 --> 28:10.348
How well do you know Nordberg?

28:10.453 --> 28:14.018
We were partners for nine years
and he's my best friend.

28:14.122 --> 28:17.521
We can't allow personal feelings
to get in the way.

28:17.625 --> 28:22.356
- Are you saying that Nordberg?
- The Queen arrives in two days.

28:22.461 --> 28:24.986
If the press should pick this up,

28:25.090 --> 28:28.158
it could be embarrassing
for the police and the city.

28:28.262 --> 28:32.500
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm giving you
24 hours to clear Nordberg.

28:43.018 --> 28:45.049
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

28:45.153 --> 28:49.771
- A Mr Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.

28:56.990 --> 29:00.065
Is there something wrong, Mr Ludwig?

29:00.169 --> 29:01.897
No, it's nothing.

29:02.001 --> 29:06.235
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly. Have a seat.

29:06.339 --> 29:09.446
I can carry out your request.

29:09.550 --> 29:13.791
- My price is $20 million.
- Your price is not a problem.

29:15.467 --> 29:19.207
But there is concern
on the part of those I represent,

29:19.311 --> 29:25.087
that you would be able to...
complete so difficult a task.

29:25.191 --> 29:27.549
Tell me, Mr Pahpshmir,

29:27.653 --> 29:33.223
in all the world,
who is the most effective assassin?

29:33.327 --> 29:38.812
I would think anyone who manages to
conceal his identity as an assassin.

29:38.916 --> 29:43.865
Yes, but there is
even a more ideal assassin.

29:45.955 --> 29:50.195
One who doesn't know
he is an assassin.

29:50.299 --> 29:52.951
- Care for some tea?
- Yes, please.

29:53.055 --> 29:56.165
Dominique, service for two, please.

30:07.726 --> 30:10.431
I must kill Pahpshmir.

30:18.445 --> 30:22.194
- Cream and sugar, sir?
- Mr Pahpshmir?

30:25.911 --> 30:28.070
Cream only, please.

30:29.832 --> 30:33.949
- There's a gun on the floor, sir!
- Just leave it. It's all right.

30:34.054 --> 30:37.294
- The tea, please.
- Of course, sir.

30:39.258 --> 30:43.791
Mr Pahpshmir, have you ever seen
sensory-induced hypnosis?

30:43.896 --> 30:45.919
I think I just have.

30:46.023 --> 30:48.756
How will she get near the target?

30:48.860 --> 30:52.796
Oh, I doubt whether it will be her.

30:52.901 --> 30:56.592
Good secretaries
are so hard to find these days.

30:56.696 --> 30:59.313
And it seems to me...

31:00.571 --> 31:03.940
anyone... can be an assassin.

31:07.411 --> 31:12.067
I had 24 hours to find
something to clear my friend's name.

31:12.171 --> 31:15.112
I returned to the hospital
with Ludwig's records

31:15.217 --> 31:17.696
to try to jog Nordberg's memory.

31:17.801 --> 31:21.492
Doctor, I have the chart,
if you're ready to go over it.

31:21.596 --> 31:24.705
I'll be with you
when I've finished with Mr Nordberg.

31:24.810 --> 31:26.879
Yes, Doctor.

31:32.436 --> 31:35.105
You'll be out of here
in a couple of...

31:41.153 --> 31:44.932
- I'd like to see Officer Nordberg.
- Sign in, please.

31:45.036 --> 31:48.356
Wait a minute!
Where's the police guard?

31:48.460 --> 31:52.398
- Drebin called and sent him home.
- Drebin?

31:52.502 --> 31:58.113
I must kill Nordberg.
I must kill Nordberg.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.461
Drebin, Police Squad!
Let go of that pillow!

32:30.910 --> 32:33.781
Medical emergency!

32:40.211 --> 32:43.960
Drebin, Police Squad.
Follow that black car!

32:45.800 --> 32:47.953
The car! Follow that car!

32:48.057 --> 32:51.665
Stephanie, check your mirror. Signal.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.220
Now pull into traffic.

32:57.395 --> 32:59.553
Try and ease off on the brake.

33:01.816 --> 33:05.861
- Give it a little gas.
- I know a short cut. Turn left here!

33:09.198 --> 33:11.571
- There he is!
- Easy!

33:26.674 --> 33:28.411
Turn right! Follow him!

33:28.516 --> 33:32.416
It's OK.
Normally, you would not be going 65

33:32.521 --> 33:35.598
down the wrong way
of a one-way street.

33:37.518 --> 33:39.558
Apply the brakes.

33:40.521 --> 33:42.348
Now put it in reverse.

33:49.864 --> 33:52.266
- You dumb broad!
- Stephanie...

33:52.371 --> 33:54.573
Gently extend your arm.

33:56.287 --> 33:59.739
Extend your middle finger.

34:02.501 --> 34:05.576
- Very good. Well done.
- There he is!

34:05.680 --> 34:08.126
Go for it, Stephanie!

34:53.302 --> 34:55.204
Excuse me. Excuse me.

34:55.309 --> 34:58.750
All right, move on!
Nothing to see here!

34:58.854 --> 35:01.296
Please disperse!

35:01.400 --> 35:03.931
Nothing to see here. Please!

35:06.315 --> 35:10.848
The attempt on Nordberg's
life left me shaken and disturbed.

35:10.952 --> 35:13.807
The questions kept coming up
again and again,

35:13.912 --> 35:15.981
like bubbles in a case of soda.

35:17.034 --> 35:19.397
Who was this character
in the hospital?

35:19.502 --> 35:23.318
Why was he trying to kill
Nordberg... and for whom?

35:23.422 --> 35:27.322
Did Ludwig lie to me?
I didn't have any proof,

35:27.426 --> 35:29.988
but somehow,
I didn't entirely trust him.

35:30.092 --> 35:33.867
Why was the "I Luv You"
not listed in Ludwig's records?

35:33.971 --> 35:36.708
If it was, did he know about it?

35:36.813 --> 35:39.040
If he didn't, who did?

35:39.144 --> 35:41.345
And where the hell was I?

35:44.311 --> 35:46.925
It was almost midnight
when I got home.

35:47.029 --> 35:49.763
I just wanted
to slip under my blankets,

35:49.867 --> 35:53.274
but my night was
just about to begin.

36:32.066 --> 36:34.522
You're late.

36:35.695 --> 36:38.353
That depends on what I'm late for.

36:38.458 --> 36:41.522
You said we should
have dinner some time.

36:41.627 --> 36:44.488
Tonight became "some time".

36:45.955 --> 36:48.113
I'm boiling a roast.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.862
How hot and wet do you like it?

36:52.966 --> 36:58.175
Very hot and awfully wet.

36:58.301 --> 37:02.041
You seem to know your way
around a kitchen.

37:02.145 --> 37:05.584
I'm just as handy
in other rooms of the house.

37:05.688 --> 37:08.003
That shirt looks familiar.

37:08.107 --> 37:12.342
It's yours. I didn't want
to get stained or wrinkled.

37:12.446 --> 37:15.441
At least... not yet.

37:18.696 --> 37:22.741
Do you mind if I slip
into something more comfortable?

37:29.081 --> 37:31.572
There. That's better.

37:33.753 --> 37:36.783
I hope you've brought your appetite.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.745
I've brought everything.

37:38.849 --> 37:41.462
Well, then, dig in.

37:46.265 --> 37:50.799
Interesting. Almost as interesting
as the photographs I saw today.

37:50.903 --> 37:53.259
I was young. I needed the work.

37:53.363 --> 37:56.469
No, they were taken
at Ludwig's docks.

37:56.573 --> 38:00.807
A ship came in, a Panamanian ship.
It wasn't on Ludwig's records.

38:00.911 --> 38:03.185
Probably an oversight.

38:03.289 --> 38:06.616
How is your... meat?

38:09.664 --> 38:11.739
You be the judge of that.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.670
Mmm...

38:19.631 --> 38:22.086
I've got nine more.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.672
- Have you seen that ship?
- I don't know.

38:29.776 --> 38:33.590
It doesn't look like ours,
but we deal with so many ships.

38:33.694 --> 38:36.595
Has Officer Nordberg
told you anything?

38:36.699 --> 38:40.724
No, there's been another attempt
on his life. He's in a coma.

38:40.828 --> 38:45.103
That's terrible!
This world is such a violent place.

38:45.207 --> 38:47.896
If it wasn't, I'd be out of a job,

38:48.000 --> 38:52.701
but I'd give it up tomorrow
to live in a world without crime.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.955
That's beautiful.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.006
This is all happening too fast.

39:04.759 --> 39:08.424
- I've been hurt before.
- I'm sorry.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.963
I'd known her for years.

39:13.068 --> 39:16.422
We used to go to
all the police functions together.

39:16.526 --> 39:19.718
How I loved her,
but she had her music.

39:19.822 --> 39:22.596
I think she had her music.

39:22.700 --> 39:26.473
She'd hang out with the
Chicago Male Chorus and Symphony.

39:26.577 --> 39:30.607
I don't recall her playing
an instrument or being able to sing.

39:30.711 --> 39:33.649
Yet she was on the road
300 days of the year.

39:33.753 --> 39:38.824
I bought her a harp for Christmas.
She asked me what it was.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.701
It's the same old story.
Boy finds girl.

39:43.806 --> 39:46.457
Boy loses girl. Girl finds boy.

39:46.562 --> 39:49.626
Boy forgets girl. Boy remembers girl.

39:49.730 --> 39:51.958
Girl dies in a blimp accident

39:52.062 --> 39:54.920
over the Orange Bowl
on New Year's Day.

39:55.024 --> 39:58.093
- Goodyear?
- No, the worst.

39:58.197 --> 39:59.931
Poor dear!

40:03.318 --> 40:06.725
Now, now. I don't want to upset you.

40:06.830 --> 40:09.813
Frank, it's not that.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.315
Why did you have to be so wonderful?

40:13.870 --> 40:18.653
- There's something I must tell you.
- No! No need to tell me anything.

40:18.757 --> 40:21.657
What's in the past
doesn't matter anyway.

40:21.761 --> 40:23.155
Maybe...

40:23.260 --> 40:28.212
Maybe we're just two lonely souls
who have found each other.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.390
Funny-face!

40:52.282 --> 40:55.939
I want you to know...
I practise safe sex.

40:56.044 --> 40:57.705
So do I.

42:31.631 --> 42:36.174
I had a wonderful day, Frank. I can't
believe we just met yesterday.

42:37.053 --> 42:40.128
You really mean that?
You're not just saying it,

42:40.232 --> 42:42.670
because we exchanged bodily fluids?

42:42.774 --> 42:46.130
No, I really mean it.
You're very special.

42:46.234 --> 42:50.552
- Can I interest you in a nightcap?
- No, thanks, I don't wear them.

42:50.656 --> 42:52.970
Actually, I'm on stake-out tonight.

42:53.074 --> 42:56.983
I'll be thinking about you.
I'll call you tomorrow.

42:58.241 --> 42:59.283
OK.

43:06.291 --> 43:08.330
Good night!

43:18.678 --> 43:21.753
The answer's up there
in Ludwig's office.

43:21.857 --> 43:24.794
Call it what you will -
a hunch, women's intuition.

43:24.899 --> 43:27.090
Ludwig knows more than he's saying.

43:27.195 --> 43:31.177
A hunch won't stand up in court.
Where are your hard facts?

43:31.281 --> 43:35.136
He's the only one except us
who knew Nordberg was still alive.

43:35.240 --> 43:39.687
Next thing we know,
some thug tries to knock him off.

43:39.792 --> 43:44.732
Maybe. But breaking into Ludwig's
office is taking a big chance.

43:44.836 --> 43:48.275
I know. You take a chance
getting up in the morning,

43:48.379 --> 43:51.488
crossing the street
or sticking your face in a fan.

43:51.592 --> 43:53.625
There he is!

43:57.383 --> 44:00.580
Just trust me on this, Ed.
I know I'm right.

44:00.684 --> 44:02.626
OK, but be careful.

44:02.730 --> 44:05.806
Get some sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

44:57.526 --> 44:58.777
Bingo!

45:46.241 --> 45:49.316
"20,000,000 deposited,
Omani Bank, Zurich,

45:49.420 --> 45:51.617
"upon proof of Queen's death."

48:14.055 --> 48:16.291
Destroying property, arson...

48:16.395 --> 48:19.504
sexual assault
with a concrete dildo?!

48:19.608 --> 48:22.427
What the hell were you doing there?

48:22.531 --> 48:24.591
I'm sorry about that, Your Honour,

48:24.695 --> 48:28.930
but we believe Ludwig is involved
in a plot to assassinate the Queen.

48:29.034 --> 48:32.806
That's ridiculous!
Where is this "evidence"?

48:32.910 --> 48:36.851
Well... it... burned in the f-fire.

48:36.956 --> 48:38.605
Gentlemen,

48:38.710 --> 48:43.071
Vincent Ludwig is one of the most
respected members of this community.

48:43.175 --> 48:47.905
If we're very nice to him,
he will agree not to press charges.

48:48.009 --> 48:50.663
- Your Honour!
- Did I make myself clear?

48:50.767 --> 48:53.378
Yes, Your Honour. Good day.

48:55.679 --> 48:57.138
Drebin!

48:57.806 --> 49:04.088
I don't want any more trouble like
you had last year. That's my policy.

49:04.192 --> 49:09.426
When I see five weirdos dressed
in togas stabbing a guy in a park,

49:09.530 --> 49:12.601
I shoot the bastards.
That's my policy.

49:12.705 --> 49:19.521
That was a Shakespeare in the Park
production of "Julius Caesar"!

49:19.625 --> 49:24.275
- You killed five actors! Good ones.
- Your Honour...

49:24.379 --> 49:28.697
Your presence at the Queen's
reception tonight is not necessary.

49:28.801 --> 49:30.743
Is that understood?

49:30.847 --> 49:33.923
We understand, Your Honour.
Thank you.

49:56.906 --> 49:59.521
The plane has taxied to a stop.

49:59.625 --> 50:02.609
Any minute now
we expect the doors to open

50:02.713 --> 50:05.273
and we'll get a glimpse
of the Queen,

50:05.377 --> 50:09.407
as she begins her first visit
to Los Angeles in five years.

50:09.512 --> 50:13.032
It's a balmy, beautiful evening too.

50:13.136 --> 50:16.547
She's going from here
to a formal reception...

50:23.183 --> 50:25.010
- Jane!
- Frank!

50:27.145 --> 50:30.220
I'm just making some dinner.
Are you hungry?

50:30.324 --> 50:32.346
Maybe just a bite.

50:32.450 --> 50:35.517
Ludwig wanted me to ask you
to meet him tonight.

50:35.621 --> 50:40.183
There is something you should know.
I was in his place last night.

50:40.287 --> 50:45.105
How nice! Did he show you his
Ming vases and rare oil paintings?

50:45.209 --> 50:49.527
Jane, I think that he's involved
in a number of criminal activities.

50:49.631 --> 50:51.656
Frank, stop it!

50:51.760 --> 50:55.076
Vincent Ludwig is a well-respected,
generous, kind man.

50:55.180 --> 50:58.413
- You don't know him like I do.
- How's that?

50:58.517 --> 51:03.958
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm sorry. I'm worried about you.

51:04.062 --> 51:08.174
I don't trust him and I don't want
you mixed up in anything dangerous.

51:08.278 --> 51:11.509
Are Woo back in business?
They closed down three years ago.

51:11.613 --> 51:16.647
Gee, has it been that long? I don't
feel like Chinese tonight anyway.

51:18.404 --> 51:23.059
It's sweet of you to be concerned,
but you're wrong about Vincent.

51:23.164 --> 51:26.937
He's such a gentleman.
He's so generous.

51:27.041 --> 51:29.068
He just wants to talk with you

51:29.173 --> 51:32.405
to clear up any doubts
you might have.

51:32.509 --> 51:34.571
- When?
- Tonight.

51:34.675 --> 51:37.533
Meet him at the 7th Street
stockyards.

51:37.637 --> 51:40.494
All right,
but promise you'll be careful.

51:40.599 --> 51:44.211
Of course I will,
funny-face, for you.

51:45.472 --> 51:48.252
I've got to go. See you tomorrow.

51:48.356 --> 51:52.182
Are you sure you won't have
something to eat?

52:17.338 --> 52:18.797
Ludwig?

52:19.673 --> 52:22.748
- Drebin?
- Yeah, I'm Drebin.

52:22.852 --> 52:26.592
I have a message for you
from Vincent Ludwig.

52:29.516 --> 52:31.548
I'm sorry, I can't hear you!

52:31.652 --> 52:34.644
Don't fire the gun
while you're talking.

52:57.168 --> 53:01.996
All right, put your gun down
and your hands up!

53:35.707 --> 53:38.448
Matthews, stake out that end,

53:38.552 --> 53:42.616
and card-check for
anyone suspicious looking.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.783
Frank, what are you doing here?

53:44.888 --> 53:48.661
I've been trading shots
with one of Ludwig's goons.

53:48.765 --> 53:52.457
They're planning
to do her tonight, here.

53:52.561 --> 53:57.515
- We better be on the lookout.
- Excuse me, ma'am, security.

53:59.355 --> 54:04.056
- What's the meaning of this?
- Relax! Nothing will happen.

54:04.160 --> 54:07.227
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah? What about this?

54:07.331 --> 54:11.645
You think we were born yesterday?
You didn't do anything, huh?

54:11.749 --> 54:13.313
I got rights!

54:13.417 --> 54:16.652
Ed, he's got a picture of your wife!

54:16.756 --> 54:17.999
Ethel!

54:20.376 --> 54:23.035
All right,
anyone else here seeing his wife?

54:23.139 --> 54:26.498
That's all right, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.

54:37.310 --> 54:39.341
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?

54:39.445 --> 54:44.054
I'm so excited to be here.
I appreciate your inviting me.

54:44.158 --> 54:47.981
Pleasure's all mine.
Perhaps afterwards we can...

54:50.197 --> 54:52.017
- Drebin!
- Frank!

54:52.122 --> 54:55.229
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr Ludwig?

54:55.333 --> 54:58.235
This is not the time
or place to talk.

54:58.339 --> 55:00.899
It's way past the time we talked.

55:01.003 --> 55:03.446
The gloves are off,
I'm playing hardball.

55:03.551 --> 55:07.828
It's fourth and fifteen, and
you're looking at a full court press.

55:07.932 --> 55:11.868
Mr Drebin!
If you have evidence, then use it.

55:11.973 --> 55:15.914
If not, I am warning you -
get off my back!

55:16.018 --> 55:18.054
Or it will cost you dearly.

55:20.811 --> 55:25.012
- Frank, what's wrong?
- A lot of things, sweetie-pie.

55:25.116 --> 55:28.802
A meeting that turned into
a peek-a-boo session with bullets,

55:28.906 --> 55:32.143
set up by someone
who's been playing me like a violin.

55:32.247 --> 55:35.019
Funny-face,
what are you talking about?

55:35.123 --> 55:39.151
My stockyard meeting, butter-wings.
Don't you remember setting that up?

55:39.255 --> 55:42.403
Mr Ludwig said you'd called it off!
Believe me!

55:42.507 --> 55:44.819
Thumb me another one, shuckie-lumps!

55:44.923 --> 55:47.659
Frank, it's the truth!

55:47.764 --> 55:51.700
Cops and women don't mix.
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.

55:51.804 --> 55:55.624
It'll clean you out,
but it'll leave you hollow inside.

55:55.728 --> 55:57.760
Too bad, sugar-puff.

55:59.182 --> 56:01.924
We could have been something.

56:02.028 --> 56:04.677
I only did what I was told to do!

56:04.782 --> 56:07.097
- Like make love to me?
- Frank!

56:08.817 --> 56:11.015
That makes things easier, Princess.

56:11.119 --> 56:14.435
To think I trusted you!
I made a big mistake.

56:14.539 --> 56:18.114
- You can take this back.
- Whose is that?

56:20.203 --> 56:24.415
Doesn't matter.
Take care of yourself, baby.

56:25.792 --> 56:27.695
By the way...

56:27.800 --> 56:29.752
I faked every orgasm.

56:30.714 --> 56:32.753
Funny-face!

56:33.550 --> 56:36.081
And to commemorate our friendship,

56:36.185 --> 56:40.711
the city of Los Angeles is proud
to present to the Royal Family

56:40.816 --> 56:46.928
this Revolutionary War musket,
donated by Mr Vincent Ludwig.

56:48.273 --> 56:51.469
Ladies and gentlemen,
Her Royal Highness,

56:51.573 --> 56:54.402
Queen Elizabeth II!

57:29.522 --> 57:34.306
It's disgusting the way they splash
this stuff all over the newspapers!

57:34.410 --> 57:37.016
What is journalism coming to?

57:37.120 --> 57:40.726
You're laying on top of the Queen
with her legs wrapped around you

57:40.830 --> 57:42.402
and they call that news!

57:42.535 --> 57:46.026
They can't kick you off the Force,
it's not fair.

57:46.130 --> 57:48.985
I know. Life isn't always fair.

57:49.089 --> 57:54.494
Just think, the next time I shoot
someone, I could be arrested.

57:54.598 --> 57:56.703
Hey, look at that!

57:56.807 --> 58:01.916
The missing evidence in the Kilner
case! My God, he WAS innocent!

58:02.020 --> 58:05.292
He went to the chair
two years ago, Frank.

58:05.396 --> 58:08.754
Well... what's the use?

58:08.858 --> 58:11.928
What good are these damn awards
and citations?

58:12.032 --> 58:13.638
Frank...

58:13.742 --> 58:16.263
Frank, that's not your desk!

58:16.368 --> 58:19.684
Frank! I've been
looking all over for you!

58:19.789 --> 58:22.855
Running another errand
for your boyfriend?

58:22.960 --> 58:26.525
I tried to call last night.
I went by your place. Where were you?

58:26.629 --> 58:29.023
I was out walking. All night.

58:29.127 --> 58:32.115
Listen to me!
I have important information.

58:32.219 --> 58:35.950
There was never anything
between Vincent and me.

58:36.054 --> 58:39.409
- He likes East German men.
- What about you?

58:39.514 --> 58:41.662
I like cops.

58:41.766 --> 58:45.628
- All right! Yeah!
- Settle down. Take it easy.

58:46.766 --> 58:49.674
- What've you got?
- I overheard Ludwig.

58:49.778 --> 58:54.885
You were right. He is planning to
have someone assassinate the Queen!

58:54.989 --> 58:57.345
- Where?
- At the baseball game.

58:57.449 --> 59:00.850
The Queen will be there
as Ludwig's guest.

59:00.954 --> 59:05.063
Is Ludwig going to shoot her
in front of 60,000 fans?

59:05.167 --> 59:07.938
No, a player,
during the 7th inning stretch.

59:08.042 --> 59:10.861
- It starts in 20 minutes.
- I'll go.

59:10.965 --> 59:13.947
- I'll go with you.
- Stay with Ludwig

59:14.051 --> 59:17.283
- to allay suspicion.
- OK, let's go!

59:17.387 --> 59:19.161
Wait! Wait!

59:19.265 --> 59:23.328
I've gotten you into enough trouble
already. I'll go alone.

59:23.433 --> 59:28.337
No! This'll get you back on
the Force. We're right behind you.

59:31.184 --> 59:35.424
Frank? I wanted you to know now,

59:35.528 --> 59:39.806
I've loved you since the first day
I met you, and I'll never stop.

59:39.911 --> 59:41.941
I'm a very lucky woman.

59:42.529 --> 59:43.940
So am I.

59:52.289 --> 59:56.778
Good afternoon.
We're coming live from the Big A,

59:56.883 --> 01:00:00.034
where the California Angels
meet the Seattle Mariners

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:04.453
in their showdown
for the Division League.

01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:08.291
Hello! I'm Curt Gowdy,
along with Jim Palmer,

01:00:08.395 --> 01:00:11.463
Tim McCarver, Dick Vitale, Mel Allen,

01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:14.755
Dick Enberg and Dr Joyce Brothers.

01:00:14.859 --> 01:00:17.594
Join us for this
all-important ball game.

01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:19.426
And a special game it is.

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:23.348
As we know, it is being attended
by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:26.114
I'm sure she'll enjoy this game, Jim.

01:00:27.198 --> 01:00:29.268
We've got all the exits covered.

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:31.437
I ought to arrest Ludwig right now.

01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:35.398
No, we've got to let him
make the first move.

01:00:35.503 --> 01:00:39.194
The Mayor would have you arrested.
You've got to stay out of sight.

01:00:39.298 --> 01:00:41.953
I've got to get that assassin.

01:00:42.057 --> 01:00:44.200
It could be any of those players.

01:00:44.304 --> 01:00:47.828
I've got to get down on that field
and search those players.

01:00:47.933 --> 01:00:51.457
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and welcome

01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:54.130
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II!

01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:04.898
One moment.

01:01:06.946 --> 01:01:09.899
Over there - these seats are taken.

01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:28.994
My dear, is something bothering you?

01:01:29.098 --> 01:01:30.791
No, why do you ask?

01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:35.087
You haven't said a word.
You seem... nervous.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:39.838
Well, you know how important
this game is for the Angels.

01:01:39.942 --> 01:01:43.511
Why he not here now?
I do not like to wait for him.

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:49.390
Mr Pallazzo, our head usher will
be here in two minutes. Please wait.

01:01:49.494 --> 01:01:53.856
- He should be here now!
- I'll send him right over.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.035
I do not wait for him!
He waits for me!

01:02:01.709 --> 01:02:04.156
- Yes?
- Mr Pallazzo?

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:07.953
I am the head usher.
I am here to... Excuse me.

01:02:13.637 --> 01:02:17.083
- Mr Pallazzo?
- Yes?

01:02:17.188 --> 01:02:21.173
- I am the head usher.
- One second.

01:02:21.277 --> 01:02:22.757
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:27.178
on behalf of the California Angels
and the City of Los Angeles,

01:02:27.282 --> 01:02:29.678
on the occasion of the royal visit,

01:02:29.783 --> 01:02:33.269
please welcome
internationally-renowned opera star,

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:35.773
Enrico Pallazzo!

01:02:38.704 --> 01:02:42.195
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us honour America,

01:02:42.299 --> 01:02:48.246
as Mr Pallazzo will now sing
our national anthem.

01:04:09.877 --> 01:04:13.950
And now we'll wait
for the exchange of line-ups

01:04:14.055 --> 01:04:16.337
and the start of today's ball game.

01:04:24.809 --> 01:04:29.554
Excuse me, could you tell me,
is this an official bat?

01:04:32.859 --> 01:04:36.433
The Queen's visit
has brought a sell-out crowd!

01:04:36.537 --> 01:04:40.814
And the fans are being entertained
by the stadium's Angel Vision,

01:04:40.918 --> 01:04:44.776
showing some unusual moments
in baseball over the years!

01:05:05.058 --> 01:05:07.097
Sorry, fellas!

01:05:34.962 --> 01:05:37.250
How about that?

01:05:39.007 --> 01:05:40.789
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:45.427
now taking the field -
your California Angels!

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.345
For everybody's safety,

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.680
we ask that you do not throw
any objects on the field.

01:05:59.784 --> 01:06:02.269
We thank you for your co-operation.

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:09.484
As the Angels take the field, we're
ready for the first pitch ceremony

01:06:09.588 --> 01:06:13.577
with the Queen of England
ready to toss out the first ball.

01:06:17.004 --> 01:06:21.076
How about that?
Let's have a round of applause!

01:06:21.181 --> 01:06:23.577
We're ready for the start,

01:06:23.681 --> 01:06:26.624
as these lovely ladies would agree.

01:06:26.728 --> 01:06:30.256
Those are the players' wives,
here to enjoy the game.

01:06:38.233 --> 01:06:41.390
What d'you say, Cummings?
Are we gonna do this today?

01:06:41.495 --> 01:06:43.102
Do what?

01:06:43.206 --> 01:06:44.988
Play ball!

01:06:48.118 --> 01:06:51.072
Frank! Al, it's Frank!

01:06:56.043 --> 01:07:00.503
The game's under way. Dave Spiwack
ready to face Jay Johnstone!

01:07:19.899 --> 01:07:23.056
- Nothing to report.
- Don't worry, Al.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.598
If one of the players is the killer,
Frank'll find him,

01:07:26.702 --> 01:07:29.938
even if he has to search
every one of them.

01:07:30.042 --> 01:07:33.397
...lead-off hitter Jay Johnstone.

01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:37.486
Hello, pal. Let's see
if that uniform's on straight.

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:42.451
Good here. Now let's see the shirt.
You should take a large.

01:07:42.555 --> 01:07:45.660
It's a little tight in the crotch.

01:07:45.764 --> 01:07:48.166
All right? All set?

01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:53.003
OK, play ball!

01:08:21.544 --> 01:08:23.004
Strike?

01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:29.129
Yeah, strike!

01:08:42.064 --> 01:08:44.984
Stee-rike two!

01:09:01.334 --> 01:09:04.670
Stee-rike three!

01:09:56.429 --> 01:09:58.256
You're clean!

01:11:48.999 --> 01:11:50.570
Have you found him yet?

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:53.237
No, and I've searched
almost everybody.

01:11:53.341 --> 01:11:57.493
Yeah. There's only one more out
before the seventh inning stretch.

01:11:57.597 --> 01:12:02.081
You're going to have to stall them.
Don't let 'em get that third out.

01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:03.430
Right.

01:12:05.432 --> 01:12:11.352
The Mariners' number four -
Armando Criscione! Criscione!

01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:21.524
- Ball!
- Ball?

01:12:31.959 --> 01:12:33.002
Ball!

01:12:44.847 --> 01:12:47.516
Get... get... what the? Get off!

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.640
Catch it! Catch it!

01:12:55.107 --> 01:12:57.183
- Get 'em off!
- Go, go, go!

01:13:01.447 --> 01:13:04.061
- Safe!
- What do you mean, safe?

01:13:04.165 --> 01:13:06.281
I don't believe it!

01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:10.197
Second base! On two!

01:13:11.373 --> 01:13:13.443
There's a throw by the catcher

01:13:13.547 --> 01:13:16.950
and now they've got Criscione
hung up between 1st and 2nd!

01:13:17.054 --> 01:13:19.160
What the hell are you doing?

01:13:19.264 --> 01:13:20.307
What?

01:13:20.507 --> 01:13:25.291
- You're not supposed to do that!
- Wait a minute! Stop that!

01:13:25.396 --> 01:13:28.091
Put that back down! Give me the ball!

01:13:30.725 --> 01:13:32.340
I'll get you!

01:13:32.444 --> 01:13:34.715
It's hard to believe,

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:38.513
but apparently the umpires
have got Criscione in a run-down!

01:13:41.235 --> 01:13:42.973
- Safe!
- Safe?

01:13:43.077 --> 01:13:44.474
How about that?

01:13:44.578 --> 01:13:46.393
- Out!
- Safe!

01:13:46.497 --> 01:13:48.477
- Out!
- He was safe!

01:13:48.581 --> 01:13:49.769
- Out!
- Safe!

01:13:49.873 --> 01:13:52.360
There's a sight I've never seen!

01:13:54.123 --> 01:13:56.071
- Safe!
- What are you doing?

01:13:56.175 --> 01:13:57.699
Safe! Safe! Safe!

01:13:57.803 --> 01:14:00.574
- He was out!
- He was safe!

01:14:00.678 --> 01:14:03.451
You idiot! He was out!

01:14:03.556 --> 01:14:05.913
All right, you're out of here!

01:14:06.018 --> 01:14:09.085
- What?
- You can't throw an umpire out!

01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:11.718
All right, YOU'RE out!

01:14:12.809 --> 01:14:16.965
Hold on! Even the guy running
the scoreboard says he was out!

01:14:17.069 --> 01:14:20.387
And he's up in the mezzanine!

01:14:20.491 --> 01:14:21.894
It's the third out!

01:14:39.252 --> 01:14:42.372
I must kill... the Queen.

01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:49.625
I must kill... the Queen.

01:14:52.348 --> 01:14:54.388
Frank, it's the right-fielder!

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:04.430
- You're the boss!
- It was safe.

01:15:04.534 --> 01:15:07.100
Now, we're going to take a walk.

01:15:07.488 --> 01:15:10.352
How could you
do something so vicious?

01:15:10.456 --> 01:15:15.317
It was easy. Don't forget I spent
two years as a building contractor.

01:15:15.421 --> 01:15:17.655
Now, let's go quietly.

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:24.246
Hey, look at that! Let's get him!

01:15:35.515 --> 01:15:37.722
Kick him in the balls!

01:16:10.717 --> 01:16:13.718
I must kill... the Queen.

01:16:24.815 --> 01:16:26.642
Look out!

01:16:31.655 --> 01:16:35.978
The umpire...
He saved the Queen's life!

01:16:36.082 --> 01:16:38.116
That's not the umpire, Your Honour.

01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:44.330
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazzo!

01:16:55.304 --> 01:16:58.378
Frank! Frank, help!

01:16:58.483 --> 01:17:01.474
Frank! Frank, help! Frank!

01:17:16.241 --> 01:17:18.144
Hold it, Ludwig!

01:17:18.248 --> 01:17:20.607
Stay where you are!

01:17:20.711 --> 01:17:23.151
- He's got a gun!
- I know.

01:17:23.255 --> 01:17:26.944
You ruined my life.
Now I'm going to ruin yours.

01:17:27.048 --> 01:17:30.035
- Leave the girl alone!
- I am. I'm going to kill you.

01:17:30.139 --> 01:17:31.381
I see.

01:17:35.593 --> 01:17:37.799
Two can play at that game!

01:17:44.352 --> 01:17:47.215
- You killed him!
- No, just stunned.

01:17:47.319 --> 01:17:49.270
He'll be all right.

01:17:55.655 --> 01:17:57.114
Well...

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:26.016
Frank... it's horrible!

01:18:27.228 --> 01:18:31.356
- It's so horrible!
- I know, Ed.

01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:34.022
My father went the same way.

01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:53.910
I must kill... Frank Drebin.

01:18:54.014 --> 01:18:57.089
I must kill... Frank Drebin.

01:18:58.175 --> 01:19:00.417
No, no, don't shoot!

01:19:00.761 --> 01:19:04.515
Jane... it's me...

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.379
Funny-face.

01:19:08.484 --> 01:19:12.301
I must kill Frank Drebin.

01:19:12.405 --> 01:19:15.178
You love Frank Drebin.

01:19:15.282 --> 01:19:18.267
And Frank Drebin loves you.

01:19:18.372 --> 01:19:22.269
Jane, if you don't love me,
you might as well pull that trigger,

01:19:22.374 --> 01:19:28.149
because without you,
I wouldn't want to live anyway.

01:19:28.253 --> 01:19:31.693
I've finally found
someone I can love -

01:19:31.798 --> 01:19:35.949
a good, clean love...
without utensils.

01:19:36.053 --> 01:19:38.882
I must kill Frank Drebin.

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:42.413
It's a topsy-turvy world, Jane,

01:19:42.518 --> 01:19:47.128
and maybe the problems of two people
don't amount to a hill of beans,

01:19:47.232 --> 01:19:50.758
but this is our hill
and these are our beans.

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:56.804
Since I met you, I've noticed
things I never knew where there -

01:19:56.908 --> 01:20:00.640
birds singing, dew glistening
on a newly-formed leaf,

01:20:00.744 --> 01:20:03.101
stop lights...

01:20:03.205 --> 01:20:04.851
I must kill...

01:20:04.956 --> 01:20:08.312
Jane, this morning...

01:20:08.417 --> 01:20:12.612
I bought something for you.
It's not very much,

01:20:12.717 --> 01:20:17.824
but pretty good
for an honest policeman's salary.

01:20:17.928 --> 01:20:19.869
It's an engagement ring.

01:20:19.973 --> 01:20:21.996
I'd have given it to you earlier,

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.342
but I wanted to wait
until we were alone.

01:20:29.516 --> 01:20:32.517
- I...
- I love you, Jane.

01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:39.768
Oh, Frank!

01:20:52.205 --> 01:20:54.291
I'm sorry!

01:21:05.051 --> 01:21:09.547
I'm sorry that I yelled at you
yesterday, I really am.

01:21:11.516 --> 01:21:12.881
Drebin!

01:21:12.985 --> 01:21:15.635
I was wrong about you.

01:21:15.739 --> 01:21:19.846
This city and the whole world
owes you a debt of gratitude.

01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:21.134
Thank you.

01:21:21.238 --> 01:21:24.558
And Monday morning
we want you back at Police Squad...

01:21:24.663 --> 01:21:28.645
- with a promotion to captain.
- Mayor...

01:21:28.749 --> 01:21:33.442
Don't thank me. There's someone else
here who wants to thank you.

01:21:33.546 --> 01:21:35.902
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!

01:21:36.006 --> 01:21:38.862
The doc says
I should be on my feet in a week!

01:21:38.966 --> 01:21:42.875
- And back on the Force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!

01:21:44.215 --> 01:21:47.500
Frank! Everyone should have
a friend like you!
