Previously on E. R.

00:08.559 --> 00:10.415
You can't throw me out.
I'm your mother.

00:10.416 --> 00:14.133
I'll keep taking my medication.
I won't be a burden.

00:14.134 --> 00:17.835
- We got some leaking fluid.
- It's just irrigation solution.

00:17.836 --> 00:19.845
- It's 10 to 6.
- I know.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.526
I thought the procedure
had gone smoothly.

00:21.527 --> 00:24.413
Well, it was a screaming success
if your desired outcome was paralysis.

00:24.414 --> 00:26.731
Oh my God...

00:27.145 --> 00:29.371
I'm being sued for malpractice.

00:29.372 --> 00:32.598
Get out! I don't want you here!
You stay away from my son!

00:33.206 --> 00:34.779
What's my prognosis?

00:35.524 --> 00:38.405
You need to talk to a neurosurgeon
right away.

E. R. 7x08 "THE DANCE WE DO"

01:00.585 --> 01:02.126
All right!

01:02.294 --> 01:03.836
Coming.

01:06.363 --> 01:09.446
- Sorry. Did I wake you?
- Yeah, kind of.

01:09.615 --> 01:11.571
Dr. Kovac ordered breakfast.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.204
I'm sorry.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.699
- Have a good day.
- You too.

01:30.462 --> 01:35.621
- Sorry. I told him to leave it outside.
- That's okay. I had to get up.

01:35.799 --> 01:38.751
- Have some if you want.
- No, thanks.

01:39.635 --> 01:42.303
You want to take a shower?
I'm almost done.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.462
I have to stop home.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.631
- You working today?
- Yeah.

01:48.224 --> 01:51.141
- Are you?
- No, no.

01:56.063 --> 01:57.307
Okay.

02:01.483 --> 02:03.392
See you later, then.

02:08.988 --> 02:10.648
Morning.

02:11.281 --> 02:12.312
Morning.

02:12.490 --> 02:15.490
- How was your night?
- What's all this?

02:16.159 --> 02:18.828
I borrowed the sewing machine
from Marge.

02:18.994 --> 02:20.192
Who's Marge?

02:20.370 --> 02:24.781
Marge is your neighbor in 2A. An adorable
woman. I'll introduce you to her.

02:24.956 --> 02:26.665
Divorced.

02:26.833 --> 02:29.786
- Coffee's fresh.
- Thanks.

02:31.336 --> 02:34.538
- You been up all night?
- No. I got up early just to finish this.

02:34.713 --> 02:36.835
I have a big interview today.

02:38.175 --> 02:41.044
- Where'd you get all that fabric?
- Sale at the yardage store.

02:41.218 --> 02:44.917
And then I talked them
into a bit more of a discount.

02:45.095 --> 02:49.637
I used the money you gave me for
bus fare. I know it wasn't my money.

02:49.807 --> 02:54.383
I will pay you back when I get this job.
It's a fabulous place. Very high-end.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.019
Big commissions.

02:56.187 --> 02:58.807
I'll buy us all-new furniture.

02:59.313 --> 03:03.559
There. Finished.
Tell me what you think.

03:03.733 --> 03:07.515
I copied it from something I saw in
a magazine. The skirt and everything.

03:07.695 --> 03:10.444
I shortened the jacket. I changed...

03:10.612 --> 03:14.063
- You don't like it.
- No, I do.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.438
Do you?

03:16.617 --> 03:18.240
You know what I got you?

03:18.408 --> 03:23.235
Something great. Knit-jersey fabric.
I love the jersey. Where is it?

03:23.412 --> 03:26.995
I'm gonna make you something.
Make that Euro-doctor take notice.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.195
Euro-doctor?

03:28.374 --> 03:31.328
I've been here long enough
to know what's happening.

03:31.502 --> 03:34.537
He's very handsome but too old
to be playing hard to get.

03:34.712 --> 03:39.455
- Well, I thought I had him.
- You do. You just don't know you do.

03:39.632 --> 03:43.214
When you're not looking,
he stares at you all the time.

03:43.385 --> 03:47.048
Here it is! Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

03:47.219 --> 03:51.051
We're gonna make a wraparound dress
with a plunging neckline.

03:51.682 --> 03:53.056
There we go.

03:53.224 --> 03:55.844
- He stares at me?
- All the time.

03:56.018 --> 04:00.345
- I'm gonna take some measurements.
- No. I have to shower before work.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.063
My interview isn't until noon.

04:02.231 --> 04:05.099
- Maybe we could have breakfast?
- Okay. If there's time.

04:05.273 --> 04:06.602
Well, hurry up.

04:29.915 --> 04:31.409
Honey, have you got any-?

04:33.417 --> 04:35.243
What are you doing?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.544
Counting your pills.

04:38.713 --> 04:39.993
- Why?
- Just checking.

04:40.171 --> 04:42.045
- I told you I'd take them.
- I know.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.503
Did I pass inspection?

04:45.592 --> 04:46.967
You taking any Prozac?

04:47.135 --> 04:50.419
I'm normal. I'm normal. I'm a little
nervous about this interview, but-

04:50.595 --> 04:52.587
- Prozac. Zoloft. Effexor.
- I gave them to you.

04:52.763 --> 04:53.926
- Did you get more?
- How?

04:54.098 --> 04:55.592
Mom!

04:55.766 --> 04:58.765
I told you. I promised you.
You don't believe me?

04:58.934 --> 05:00.677
- Can you do me a favor?
- Anything.

05:00.853 --> 05:02.227
Come to the hospital with me.

05:02.395 --> 05:04.268
- What for?
- A blood test.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.727
- A blood test?
- Yes.

05:07.565 --> 05:12.938
- Would you do that for me?
- Sure. Sure, I'd do anything for you.

05:19.115 --> 05:21.237
E. R.

06:10.150 --> 06:13.599
There was no epidural. I was the only
one remotely close to the dura.

06:13.776 --> 06:16.693
- Answer the questions. You'll do fine.
- I had to have punctured it.

06:16.862 --> 06:19.399
It's a known risk.
It does not constitute negligence.

06:19.572 --> 06:20.946
Mark, missing a leak does.

06:21.114 --> 06:24.233
I don't even remember looking
before I removed the endoscope.

06:24.408 --> 06:27.824
You've done 100 of these. You know
the procedure. There was a bad outcome.

06:27.995 --> 06:32.535
They're looking for someone to blame.
It doesn't mean you did anything wrong.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.203
- Do you want me to ride with you?
- No, go to work.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.750
You sure?

06:38.959 --> 06:41.201
Hey. Don't go jogging
into any more street signs.

06:41.378 --> 06:44.212
- Hard as a rock.
- Apparently not.

06:45.172 --> 06:49.002
- How long do these depositions last?
- Call me if it goes past midnight.

06:49.549 --> 06:52.041
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

06:57.472 --> 07:00.970
I hate to go on an interview
with a big Band-Aid on my arm.

07:01.141 --> 07:04.095
- What will they think?
- You have a suit jacket.

07:04.269 --> 07:09.261
Yeah. Yeah. Hope I don't have to take it
off if the room gets warm or something.

07:09.439 --> 07:13.269
- Tell them you gave blood.
- Yeah. I don't wanna be late, though.

07:13.441 --> 07:16.013
Rule number one is,
do not be late for an interview.

07:16.193 --> 07:18.434
- This will just take a minute.
- I'd like to be early.

07:18.611 --> 07:21.232
What if I go and come back?
Then if you want to do this...

07:21.405 --> 07:23.362
Okay. Hold still.

07:23.531 --> 07:24.941
I just don't understand, Abby.

07:25.115 --> 07:28.032
I mean, you've let me in your home.
We're getting along so well.

07:28.201 --> 07:31.865
This is an absolute gift. I mean,
what will taking my blood accomplish?

07:32.037 --> 07:34.075
- Nothing, hopefully.
- Wait, stop. Stop. Stop.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.954
Listen to me, honey. Listen.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.530
When this test comes
back negative or positive...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.910
...or whatever it's supposed to be,
then you're gonna feel foolish...

07:42.084 --> 07:46.082
...and I'm gonna be hurt.
And then you're gonna feel bad.

07:46.421 --> 07:48.294
You can't touch
the vein after it's clean.

07:48.464 --> 07:50.255
- That can't be what you want!
- It's not.

07:50.425 --> 07:53.340
Then, honey, let's just not do this!

07:54.551 --> 07:57.422
- Need some help in here?
- No, we're fine.

07:57.596 --> 08:00.595
- Hi, Dave.
- Hey. Hello, Mrs. Lockhart.

08:00.763 --> 08:04.843
- Oh, it's Wyczenski.
- Right. Right. Are you not feeling well?

08:05.017 --> 08:08.931
- No. Why, do I look sick?
- No, no. Actually, you look great.

08:09.104 --> 08:12.435
Thank you.
You look good too.

08:12.605 --> 08:15.808
Thank you. What's the draw for?

08:16.650 --> 08:18.771
I'm giving blood.

08:21.403 --> 08:25.613
- What? That's what you told me to say.
- Go. Just go. Go ahead.

08:25.782 --> 08:27.986
- What?
- Just go. I don't want you to be late.

08:28.157 --> 08:29.188
- Really?
- Yes.

08:29.366 --> 08:30.860
- Honestly?
- Yes.

08:31.034 --> 08:32.861
Sweetie, I love you.

08:33.035 --> 08:35.703
Okay. Thank you.

08:36.787 --> 08:39.243
- Bye, Dave.
- It's good to see you, Miss W.

08:39.414 --> 08:43.791
Miss W. I like that. Miss W.
I'll call you, let you know how it goes.

08:44.502 --> 08:45.912
Bye.

08:46.086 --> 08:47.994
Must be nice having such good genes.

08:48.170 --> 08:50.412
Knowing that you're gonna
grow up looking like that.

08:50.589 --> 08:52.166
You got a...

08:53.508 --> 08:55.298
- Is this about a patient?
- No.

08:55.467 --> 08:56.842
- Bye, Randi.
- Hi, Maggie.

08:57.010 --> 08:59.002
- Love that top!
- Thanks.

08:59.178 --> 09:04.087
- He's supposed to be working.
- Abby, have you seen Dr. Malucci?

09:04.264 --> 09:07.182
- He's around here somewhere.
- Tell him Stephanie stopped by.

09:07.350 --> 09:10.552
- Your last name?
- He knows my last name.

09:11.603 --> 09:14.519
I don't get it. He had some other
girl looking for him yesterday.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.810
Fire enough shots,
eventually you hit something.

09:16.981 --> 09:19.686
- Or catch something.
- Don't knock it until you try it.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.139
What?

09:21.318 --> 09:23.689
Abby! A girl out here needs
help! She's bleeding!

09:23.860 --> 09:26.102
Some kids, they
just threw her from a car.

09:31.034 --> 09:34.068
- Honey? Honey, here you are. Take this.
- What happened?

09:34.243 --> 09:36.532
- They hardly stopped the car.
- I'm okay.

09:36.704 --> 09:37.901
- No, you're not.
- Step back.

09:38.079 --> 09:41.660
Okay. Let's sit down. Come on.
Careful. Okay, okay.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.242
- What's your name?
- Kynesha.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.372
Okay, Kynesha.
Lean back. Let me take a look.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.867
- Did someone beat you up?
- I fell.

09:48.044 --> 09:49.373
Nonsense. Honey, who did this?

09:49.545 --> 09:51.833
- Mom, go to your interview.
- I'm trying to help.

09:52.005 --> 09:53.664
We don't need your help. Go.

09:53.839 --> 09:57.208
Did you have a loss of consciousness?
Any trouble breathing?

09:57.384 --> 09:59.505
Get a gurney and page X-ray.

09:59.676 --> 10:01.301
Abby?

10:01.595 --> 10:03.337
Yeah.

10:03.513 --> 10:06.383
Mr. Resnik called from the garage.
He's on his way up now.

10:06.557 --> 10:08.050
Thank you.

10:10.058 --> 10:12.300
We'll wait five minutes,
and then we'll leave.

10:12.477 --> 10:14.386
I can stay.
I've taken the whole day off.

10:14.562 --> 10:17.051
We shouldn't have
to play these kind of games.

10:17.229 --> 10:19.305
- Gordy, good to see you.
- Bruce.

10:19.482 --> 10:22.932
Sorry to keep you waiting. There was
a pileup on the expressway. Real mess.

10:23.109 --> 10:24.983
- I'm sure.
- You must be Dr. Corday.

10:25.153 --> 10:27.440
- Bruce Resnik. Pleasure to meet you.
- And you.

10:28.654 --> 10:31.227
They didn't tell me
you were so stunning.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.069
That's okay.
You don't have to respond.

10:35.241 --> 10:37.815
- Has the court reporter set up?
- In the library.

10:37.994 --> 10:39.404
Let's get going.

10:40.287 --> 10:42.079
After you.

10:48.585 --> 10:51.750
- Hey, Irene. How are you this morning?
- Fine, Mr. Resnik. Yourself?

10:51.920 --> 10:54.410
- Can't complain. Hey, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

10:54.588 --> 10:57.209
Please have a seat.

10:57.382 --> 11:00.252
Ignore the camera. Thank you.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.594
Everyone was rubbernecking
past this accident.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.710
I waited my turn. So, of course,
I take a look. You know, human nature.

11:07.889 --> 11:13.343
And these firemen are using
one of those big steel things to cut.

11:13.517 --> 11:15.556
- What do you call them?
- Jaws of Life.

11:15.727 --> 11:19.012
Jaws of Life! Right. I mean,
it looked pretty dangerous to me.

11:19.188 --> 11:21.760
- You ever use one of those?
- No, not personally.

11:21.939 --> 11:25.639
It was cutting into the car like
a can opener. Anyway, shall we start?

11:25.818 --> 11:26.848
Certainly.

11:27.027 --> 11:29.647
Please raise your right hand.

11:31.946 --> 11:34.068
- There's no Bible?
- No.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.738
Do you swear to tell the truth
in this matter, so help you God?

11:37.909 --> 11:38.939
Yes.

11:39.117 --> 11:43.114
We are on the record in a deposition on
the behalf of the plaintiff, Al Patterson.

11:43.287 --> 11:46.039
Plaintiff's attorney's Bruce Resnik.
Gordon Price for defense.

11:46.207 --> 11:48.494
Doctor, state and spell
your name for the record.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.582
Elizabeth Corday. C-O-R-D-A-Y.

11:51.751 --> 11:53.744
Doctor, how long
have you been a surgeon?

11:53.920 --> 11:56.161
Including Residency?
Ten years.

11:56.338 --> 11:59.124
Have you ever had
a deposition taken before?

11:59.298 --> 12:02.997
- No, this is the first.
- After 10 years, that's pretty good.

12:03.176 --> 12:05.962
Well, only three have been in America.

12:06.136 --> 12:07.878
Touché.

12:08.637 --> 12:10.844
Extraocular movements are intact.

12:11.015 --> 12:14.797
Okay, Kynesha. We need to remove your
pants so I can check for injuries, okay?

12:14.974 --> 12:18.972
- It's just my face.
- I know, but we still need to check.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.062
I'll be right back.

12:25.315 --> 12:27.640
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey.

12:27.817 --> 12:30.438
There's an inguinal hernia
in Curtain 3. Could you look?

12:30.611 --> 12:32.235
Yeah, after the assault victim.

12:32.404 --> 12:34.479
We've got it.
Probably just a facial fracture.

12:34.655 --> 12:36.647
Well, I'll clear the belly.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.103
She's stable.

12:38.282 --> 12:41.485
There's blood in her underwear.
She says it's her period.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.817
Get a rape kit.

12:44.119 --> 12:45.662
Peter, wait.

12:46.163 --> 12:48.321
You shouldn't take this one.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.367
Why?

12:50.666 --> 12:52.243
It's Jesse's girlfriend.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.118
I can take care of her.

12:58.255 --> 13:02.001
I'm gonna come in close
and check the back of your eyes.

13:02.173 --> 13:03.833
Let's take a look in your ears now.

13:04.008 --> 13:05.336
Peter!

13:05.676 --> 13:07.466
Good. No hemotympanum.

13:07.635 --> 13:10.042
- What's that?
- That means you didn't crack your skull.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.093
- I'm Dr. Benton.
- I know.

13:14.599 --> 13:17.433
Is there anyone you want us to call?
Mother, father?

13:17.601 --> 13:19.888
She won't be home.

13:20.853 --> 13:26.690
The re-enhancing lesion and central
necrosis on MRI was suspicious.

13:27.691 --> 13:29.682
The biopsy confirms it.

13:29.858 --> 13:33.227
Another pathologist should take a look.
Could be an astrocytoma.

13:33.403 --> 13:37.897
Two neuro specialists have reviewed
the slides independently. They concur.

13:38.072 --> 13:39.103
It's a GBM.

13:41.825 --> 13:43.698
What's the survival rate?

13:43.869 --> 13:45.528
Untreated, eight weeks.

13:45.703 --> 13:48.370
With radiation therapy, the average
increases six to nine months.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.454
So you need to go see
a radiation oncologist today.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.449
What about surgery?

13:53.958 --> 13:56.365
I'm afraid the tumor is inoperable.

13:57.168 --> 13:59.837
- Why?
- It looks like it invaded Broca's area.

14:00.003 --> 14:04.462
The speech arrest you were experiencing
was probably the result of a focal seizure.

14:04.631 --> 14:07.632
Even if we removed the entire tumor,
you'd most likely be left...

14:07.801 --> 14:11.927
...with the inability to speak
and understand language.

14:12.095 --> 14:14.004
- Communication.
- More than communication.

14:14.180 --> 14:17.547
You'd lose all ability to comprehend,
interact with the world around you.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.215
Essentially, what makes you human.

14:20.393 --> 14:25.219
Even if you consented,
I wouldn't even consider operating.

14:28.898 --> 14:31.898
We'll keep you on Dilantin,
300 milligrams daily.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.354
Do you have disability insurance?

14:40.364 --> 14:41.394
Dr. Greene?

14:42.907 --> 14:44.152
Yeah.

14:50.245 --> 14:53.577
What's going on, Carter?
Why are we so backed up?

14:53.747 --> 14:54.863
I just got here.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.875
Weaver's not on till tonight.
This happens when she's off.

14:58.043 --> 15:01.541
- Hey, what happened to your head?
- Jogging. I ran into a street sign.

15:01.712 --> 15:03.122
She left you a note.

15:03.421 --> 15:07.915
- Take the shoulder pain and the vertigo.
- Dr. Greene, guy with palpitations.

15:08.090 --> 15:12.170
Tachycardic at 300.
BP is 100/70. Normal mentation.

15:12.344 --> 15:16.091
- Six of adenosine. I'll be right there.
- Did you say heart rate was 300?

15:16.263 --> 15:19.346
If it's Wolff-Parkinson-White,
adenosine could put him into V-fib.

15:19.515 --> 15:23.843
Yeah, right. 100 milligrams
procainamide. IV every 10 minutes.

15:24.019 --> 15:25.512
- Thanks, Carter.
- Sure. You okay?

15:25.686 --> 15:27.843
Yeah. It's been a long morning.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.594
Listen, we have to do
a blood and urine test on you.

15:30.773 --> 15:32.848
- It's your three-month mark.
- Right now?

15:33.024 --> 15:35.430
- Sometime in the next six hours.
- Whenever.

15:35.608 --> 15:39.392
Listen, if you want privacy, I'll do the
stick. Otherwise, you can ask a nurse.

15:39.570 --> 15:40.732
Yeah, I'll ask Abby.

15:40.904 --> 15:42.731
- Randi, what's open?
- Exam 1.

15:42.906 --> 15:44.280
Meet you there.

15:45.198 --> 15:48.567
Liver and spleen are good.
No peritoneal free fluid.

15:49.410 --> 15:51.698
No lacerations or contusions.

15:51.870 --> 15:54.028
Kynesha, when's the last time
you had intercourse?

15:54.205 --> 15:55.580
I don't remember.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.998
Woods lamp.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.040
I'll get the lights.

16:04.836 --> 16:07.043
- What's that do?
- Hold on.

16:09.715 --> 16:11.376
- There's no semen.
- What?

16:11.550 --> 16:14.384
We got some abrasions, but no stridor.

16:14.551 --> 16:17.303
I need to do a pelvic exam, Kynesha.
Do you know what that is?

16:17.471 --> 16:20.257
- No. I'm on my period. I told you.
- I still need to check.

16:20.431 --> 16:21.675
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Sit down.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.054
- Let me go!
- Come on. Calm down.

16:24.225 --> 16:26.715
Kynesha, it's important
we give you an exam.

16:26.893 --> 16:29.265
Not down there. Just fix my face.

16:29.437 --> 16:33.729
Look, we know it's hard, but if someone
sexually assaulted you, we have to check.

16:33.898 --> 16:36.685
I didn't get raped.
I got beat up. That's all.

16:36.859 --> 16:39.893
- Who beat you up?
- I got jumped out. No big thing.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.776
- Of a gang?
- I did okay.

16:41.945 --> 16:44.233
Some girls get real messed up.

16:44.405 --> 16:46.064
I did okay.

16:49.450 --> 16:54.823
So you concede Mr. Patterson's
surgery started at 5: 17 p. m.

16:54.996 --> 16:57.567
According to the chart, yes.

16:57.746 --> 17:01.411
And you sent Mr. Patterson
to Pre-Op at 2: 15 p. m.?

17:01.583 --> 17:05.082
- Approximately, yes.
- Expecting to operate within the hour?

17:05.252 --> 17:07.824
- Expecting to operate immediately.
- But you didn't.

17:08.003 --> 17:10.790
You didn't start the operation
for another three hours, did you?

17:10.964 --> 17:12.244
- No.
- Why not?

17:12.424 --> 17:13.752
I'm on emergency call.

17:13.925 --> 17:16.877
A life-threatening gunshot wound
to a 14-year-old boy came in.

17:17.051 --> 17:18.593
I had to respond.

17:18.761 --> 17:22.260
- And were you able to save this boy?
- No.

17:22.431 --> 17:25.098
And this Jesse Robbins...

17:26.266 --> 17:29.302
- Did you know him?
- By association, yes.

17:29.685 --> 17:33.895
And that association was through
a colleague, Dr. Peter Benton?

17:34.605 --> 17:37.937
- He was Dr. Benton's nephew.
- And Dr. Benton is your former lover?

17:38.107 --> 17:39.483
Don't answer that.

17:41.110 --> 17:44.393
Was the boy you weren't able to save
the nephew of your former lover?

17:44.569 --> 17:48.317
Move it along, Bruce. That has no
probative value, and she's not answering.

17:48.489 --> 17:51.490
- Are you refusing to answer that-?
- She's not answering.

17:51.658 --> 17:54.611
Fine. She'll answer
in front of the judge.

17:55.786 --> 17:58.739
So the death of his nephew
was upsetting to you.

17:58.913 --> 18:01.616
- Of course.
- How long did it upset you?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.112
I'm not sure.

18:04.292 --> 18:09.285
Losing a young boy, a boy you knew, a
boy close to someone you cared about...

18:09.463 --> 18:11.786
...it must have been
quite overwhelming.

18:11.963 --> 18:13.871
Is that a question?

18:15.049 --> 18:18.132
- Was it overwhelming?
- At that moment.

18:18.301 --> 18:21.135
So overwhelming and tragic
that it was still on your mind...

18:21.303 --> 18:23.710
...while you operated on my client.

18:23.888 --> 18:26.295
Wasn't it, Dr. Corday?

18:27.391 --> 18:31.635
Guess I should have had that
blood transfusion this morning, huh?

18:32.477 --> 18:35.430
Come on. That was funny.

18:36.772 --> 18:39.344
This is kind of ironic, isn't it?

18:40.607 --> 18:43.276
Check my cholesterol while you're at it?

18:43.984 --> 18:46.439
Hey, you!
You're supposed to be watching this.

18:46.611 --> 18:49.183
You think I want
to be doing this, Carter?

18:49.363 --> 18:51.320
I don't have better things to do?

18:51.782 --> 18:54.616
- Okay. What should I do with this?
- Give it to me.

18:54.784 --> 18:56.692
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

18:56.868 --> 18:59.785
Abby, paramedics called.
Your mom's hurt. She's asking for you.

18:59.954 --> 19:01.328
- What happened?
- I don't know.

19:01.496 --> 19:03.987
She's outside a clothing store
on Oak Street.

19:05.582 --> 19:07.621
If she wants to give names,
I'll check it out.

19:07.793 --> 19:10.283
She's afraid.
She's not going to give names.

19:10.461 --> 19:13.081
Dr. Benton? She wants to talk to you.

19:13.254 --> 19:16.005
If she changes her mind,
give me a call.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.212
- Peter, I said I'd take care of her.
- I got it.

19:23.594 --> 19:26.132
Looks like you broke your cheekbone.

19:26.305 --> 19:29.174
Gonna have to do
a CAT scan of your face.

19:33.017 --> 19:35.507
So you're really gonna protect
the girls who did this?

19:36.019 --> 19:40.063
I'm protecting myself. If they find out
I said something, they gonna kill me.

19:40.231 --> 19:42.269
Like they did Jesse?

19:47.360 --> 19:48.391
You don't know that.

19:48.569 --> 19:51.522
I know he wasn't
a gang member and you are.

19:51.696 --> 19:54.067
- Was.
- The only reason he was...

19:54.239 --> 19:56.695
...in that neighborhood
is because of you.

19:56.867 --> 19:59.403
He only came there twice.

20:00.493 --> 20:02.700
Said he didn't like me banging.

20:02.871 --> 20:06.203
Kept telling me that
I was better than all that.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.287
That he loved me.
He was gonna get me out.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.376
You're telling me
that's why they killed him?

20:13.837 --> 20:18.544
He ditched school.
Tried to get me to come over.

20:19.882 --> 20:23.047
Told me that his mom
was gonna figure things out.

20:23.217 --> 20:25.376
We had a fight.

20:28.762 --> 20:30.802
I was walking away...

20:30.973 --> 20:32.052
...when it happened.

20:32.224 --> 20:34.714
You saw who shot him?

20:34.892 --> 20:37.263
That's why I don't want to be
a part of it no more.

20:38.311 --> 20:39.769
I loved him too.

20:40.937 --> 20:43.226
Who shot him, Kynesha?

20:44.398 --> 20:46.437
You just said you loved him.

20:46.608 --> 20:48.933
- You'll tell the cops if I told you.
- No.

20:49.110 --> 20:52.110
- Why you asking?
- Because I gotta know.

20:54.238 --> 20:58.530
- You swear you ain't gonna say nothing?
- Kynesha...

21:02.119 --> 21:04.074
Who murdered my nephew?

21:04.661 --> 21:06.903
- You need to hold still.
- My daughter is a doctor.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.405
I don't need you to do any of this.
Don't touch me.

21:09.582 --> 21:11.906
She's a doctor.
She will be here. She can do this.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.538
Abby, this wasn't my fault.
This man came after me.

21:14.710 --> 21:16.417
You her daughter?

21:16.586 --> 21:18.413
- She was shoplifting.
- I was not!

21:18.588 --> 21:20.461
Why would I shoplift
a $10 scarf?

21:20.631 --> 21:24.414
- It's a $300 scarf.
- Well, it looks like a $10 scarf!

21:24.592 --> 21:27.260
She ran straight into my door.
Shattered glass everywhere.

21:27.427 --> 21:30.261
You don't want to arrest her.
It's not worth it. I'm a nurse-

21:30.429 --> 21:32.800
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with me!

21:32.972 --> 21:35.261
- What's wrong with you?
- She has a mood disorder.

21:35.433 --> 21:37.970
- She was stealing.
- She wasn't stealing, she was confused.

21:38.143 --> 21:41.475
You weren't there. She walked into
the store, demanded a job. I explained-

21:41.645 --> 21:45.309
Let me tell you something, dearie,
I have better retail skills than you!

21:45.481 --> 21:47.308
Be quiet, Mom!

21:47.483 --> 21:50.351
Common courtesy
and politeness being two of them!

21:50.525 --> 21:53.645
Can I give you my phone number,
and then I'll pay for the glass?

21:53.820 --> 21:55.527
- Is that cool?
- What if she comes back?

21:55.696 --> 21:58.102
- I have customers in there.
- She won't come back.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.273
- You'll take care of it?
- Yes, I promise.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.358
Fine! Just get her out of here!

22:03.618 --> 22:05.243
Up to 5 of Haldol, p. r.n.

22:05.411 --> 22:08.079
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.540
- What? You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.461
Your naltrexone level
was nondetectable.

22:19.628 --> 22:22.795
- My naltrexone level?
- You're supposed to be on 50 mgs a day.

22:22.965 --> 22:26.331
I thought it was a drug screen. I didn't
know you were screening for naltrexone.

22:26.508 --> 22:27.966
It's in your contract.

22:28.135 --> 22:30.885
My prescription ran out,
and I haven't had time to refill it.

22:31.053 --> 22:32.961
You know that
it's part of the agreement.

22:33.138 --> 22:37.430
And I'm taking it.
I don't need it, and I'm taking it.

22:37.599 --> 22:38.629
What?

22:38.808 --> 22:41.133
You're not the only one
with something at stake here.

22:41.310 --> 22:45.056
We put ourselves on the line
to give you a fresh start.

22:45.228 --> 22:47.850
In any other circumstance,
you'd either be dead or in jail.

22:48.023 --> 22:52.101
Fresh start, huh? You really
think this has been a fresh start?

22:52.692 --> 22:56.475
I think that I've done absolutely
everything that you've asked of me.

22:56.653 --> 22:58.313
And I've done it without complaint.

22:58.488 --> 23:02.400
I think that I've obeyed these arbitrary
and arcane rules and regulations...

23:02.573 --> 23:05.146
...about what patients I can treat
and what patients I can't.

23:05.326 --> 23:08.693
I think I've peed into cups.
I think you've taken my blood.

23:08.870 --> 23:11.490
And I think at some point,
it's gonna have to be enough.

23:11.663 --> 23:16.324
I think at some point, you're
actually gonna have to trust me.

23:20.377 --> 23:22.037
Hey, Mark!

23:23.379 --> 23:26.996
I need some help in here! Chuny,
get in here and get me some Ativan!

23:27.174 --> 23:29.295
- Mark!
- Oh, my God! What happened?

23:29.466 --> 23:30.581
- Get the Ativan.
- How much?

23:30.759 --> 23:32.550
Four milligrams now.
Mark.

23:32.718 --> 23:33.750
- Did he hit his head?
- No.

23:33.928 --> 23:37.260
- Does he have a fever?
- I don't know. He just started seizing.

23:37.430 --> 23:39.054
Hold him still.

23:39.223 --> 23:41.974
All right.
Start him on 15 liters of O-2.

23:42.142 --> 23:46.434
Get a line going. And then
I need a pulse ox and a set of vitals.

23:46.603 --> 23:49.852
Get a tox screen.
Finger stick of glucose.

23:52.232 --> 23:55.185
- What do you want for labs?
- CBC and a Chem-20.

23:55.358 --> 23:57.018
Carter?

23:57.194 --> 24:00.478
Dr. Greene? Hey, hey, Mark!
Can you hear me?

24:00.654 --> 24:03.192
- Squeeze my hands. Right and left.
- What happened?

24:03.365 --> 24:05.522
You had a seizure.
Your vitals have been stable.

24:05.699 --> 24:08.569
You didn't drop your sats.
We're gonna take you for a head CT.

24:08.743 --> 24:11.909
See if you can follow my finger with
your eyes. Come on. Just lay back.

24:12.079 --> 24:13.737
- No.
- We need to work this up.

24:13.912 --> 24:16.485
- I don't want to work it up.
- Neuro is coming for a consult.

24:16.665 --> 24:19.202
- It's not necessary.
- You had a new onset seizure.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.742
I just need a Dilantin level.
I can go to the outpatient lab.

24:22.919 --> 24:26.287
- Relax. I called Kovac in to cover.
- You've got a Hep-Lock on your arm.

24:26.463 --> 24:29.333
- I'll handle it. I'll handle it!
- Mark. Mark.

24:33.217 --> 24:36.217
- Dr. Greene, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

24:37.095 --> 24:39.764
Hey, boss, what are you doing?
I heard you had a seizure.

24:39.931 --> 24:41.969
Yeah? You heard wrong.

24:42.348 --> 24:46.428
Mr. Patterson's condition needed
immediate surgical attention, did it not?

24:46.602 --> 24:48.724
It depends on what
you mean by "immediate. "

24:48.895 --> 24:51.764
- You had to operate that day.
- Within the next 24 hours.

24:51.938 --> 24:54.855
The endoscopic surgery is certainly
the fastest procedure, correct?

24:55.023 --> 24:58.273
- Among other benefits.
- So it was more convenient for you.

24:58.443 --> 25:01.110
I base my surgical opinions
on what I perceive...

25:01.278 --> 25:03.436
...to be in the best
interests of the patient.

25:03.613 --> 25:05.439
- The recovery, how-
- Let me try again.

25:05.614 --> 25:09.610
Perhaps you didn't hear the question.
The endoscopic surgery was faster...

25:09.783 --> 25:13.032
...and easier on your schedule
than the alternate open procedure.

25:13.203 --> 25:14.613
- Of course, but-
- Thank you.

25:14.787 --> 25:17.159
How long does
the endoscopic procedure take?

25:17.330 --> 25:21.113
My schedule had nothing whatsoever
to do with my advice to Mr. Patterson.

25:21.291 --> 25:23.283
Please strike that as nonresponsive.

25:23.459 --> 25:28.250
Dr. Corday, how long does the
endoscopic procedure take to perform?

25:29.922 --> 25:31.120
About an hour.

25:31.924 --> 25:35.586
But you performed Mr. Patterson's
endoscopic discectomy in 42 minutes.

25:35.758 --> 25:36.790
Correct?

25:36.968 --> 25:39.209
I don't know.
I'd have to check the operative report.

25:39.387 --> 25:42.256
If the operative report
stated that you were in the O.R...

25:42.430 --> 25:45.181
...less than 43 minutes,
would you say that's correct?

25:45.349 --> 25:46.379
It could be.

25:46.558 --> 25:50.685
Do you have any reason to doubt
the veracity of the operative report?

25:50.853 --> 25:51.884
No.

25:52.062 --> 25:55.181
Would it surprise you that
of the 87 endoscopic discectomies...

25:55.356 --> 25:59.518
...you performed before November 16,
your fastest time was 54 minutes?

25:59.692 --> 26:01.684
Twelve minutes slower
than Mr. Patterson.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.528
- Objection. You're testifying, Bruce.
- It's a question.

26:04.695 --> 26:07.102
- She can count.
- Would that surprise you?

26:07.281 --> 26:08.311
Let's move on.

26:08.490 --> 26:10.695
Did you know the fastest
you performed this procedure...

26:10.866 --> 26:14.649
...was 12 minutes slower
than Mr. Patterson's surgery?

26:14.827 --> 26:16.024
I do now.

26:16.536 --> 26:19.572
- You don't time yourself?
- It's not a race.

26:19.747 --> 26:22.533
Then why did the circulating
nurse remind you it was 10 to 6?

26:22.707 --> 26:24.699
Objection.
Assumes facts not in evidence.

26:24.876 --> 26:27.662
Do you recall the circulating
nurse reminding you that...

26:27.836 --> 26:30.670
...it was 10 to 6 while you were
operating on Mr. Patterson?

26:30.838 --> 26:32.995
- Yes.
- Why did you need to be reminded?

26:33.172 --> 26:34.547
To keep me on schedule.

26:34.715 --> 26:37.253
What did you have scheduled
after Mr. Patterson's surgery?

26:37.426 --> 26:38.670
I had an engagement.

26:38.843 --> 26:40.633
Someplace more important
you had to be?

26:40.802 --> 26:42.759
No, and I resent the inference.

26:42.929 --> 26:44.174
What inference is that?

26:44.347 --> 26:46.054
That I rushed Mr. Patterson's surgery...

26:46.223 --> 26:49.507
- ... to satisfy a personal obligation.
- That's it. We're taking a break.

26:49.683 --> 26:51.260
- Did you rush?
- Don't answer that.

26:51.434 --> 26:54.637
Did the nurse remind you of the time
because you needed to leave by 6?

26:54.812 --> 26:56.187
- Yes.
- We're taking a break.

26:56.355 --> 26:59.639
- Did you get that?
- We're off the record. Stop typing.

26:59.815 --> 27:01.973
Now, I said we're taking a break.

27:02.150 --> 27:03.644
Let's go.

27:07.362 --> 27:11.525
All I wanted to do was talk to the owner.
If I talked to him, I knew he'd hire me.

27:11.699 --> 27:14.901
- What happened?
- I don't know.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.703
- Dr. Greene had a seizure?
- Yeah.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.620
I've never understood people
who make themselves feel big...

27:21.788 --> 27:26.033
...by making other people feel small.
Let me tell you. I've got experience.

27:26.207 --> 27:28.699
- Sit down. Sit down.
- You know what? She was threatened.

27:28.877 --> 27:30.703
She knew I could outsell her.
She knew it.

27:30.878 --> 27:34.079
So she sent that Neanderthal in on me.
You know why? She was threatened.

27:34.254 --> 27:35.535
Did you even have an interview?

27:35.714 --> 27:39.331
Of course I had an interview.
Until she chased me into the window.

27:40.551 --> 27:43.171
- God, this is bad! This is bad.
- You need stitches.

27:43.344 --> 27:47.044
Here. Sit down. We'll get an x-ray
and make sure there's no glass in it.

27:47.222 --> 27:51.265
- Keep pressure on it. I'll be right back.
- All right. Abby. Abby.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.304
- You're mad at me.
- No, Mom, I'm not mad at you.

27:55.477 --> 27:58.015
- I thought you would be mad.
- Sit down.

28:00.398 --> 28:05.603
I have plenty of experience.
Plenty of experience.

28:05.776 --> 28:09.607
Do you think I'm gonna
put up with that? Well, I'm not.

28:09.779 --> 28:11.854
I'm not gonna put up with that.

28:13.531 --> 28:15.404
See if I don't.

28:15.574 --> 28:17.732
I hate people like that.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.731
I have so much
more experience than you.

28:20.910 --> 28:22.737
I don't think
she's gonna say anything.

28:22.913 --> 28:24.904
It seems like
she wants us to get this girl.

28:25.081 --> 28:27.203
I gave you the name.
Why don't you pick the girl up?

28:27.374 --> 28:29.081
We have to get it from her.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.744
What if she doesn't say anything?

28:31.918 --> 28:34.919
Depends.
We can bring in the D.A., maybe a judge.

28:35.088 --> 28:38.537
There's fluid in the maxillary sinus.
No depressed fracture.

28:38.714 --> 28:40.208
Good. Good.

28:40.382 --> 28:43.631
Kynesha, there are a couple of guys
out here that need to talk to you.

28:43.801 --> 28:49.042
No! No way!
I told you I don't know nothing!

28:55.558 --> 28:59.093
- Looks like you're feeling better.
- Yeah.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.936
I got my prescription refilled.
Do you want to see me take it?

29:04.608 --> 29:06.433
Thanks for helping me out.

29:06.608 --> 29:08.933
Sure. You want
to tell me what happened?

29:09.110 --> 29:11.268
Not particularly.

29:11.445 --> 29:14.813
You know, I did treat you.
Technically, I am your doctor.

29:14.989 --> 29:17.905
Anything you tell me is confidential.

29:20.618 --> 29:22.657
Okay, doctor.

29:22.952 --> 29:25.027
It's quite simple.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.950
I have a brain tumor.

29:29.123 --> 29:32.787
- What?
- Glioblastoma multiforme.

29:33.751 --> 29:35.126
Bummer, huh?

29:35.294 --> 29:38.876
Gets better.
I found out that it's inoperable.

29:41.297 --> 29:46.539
- Mark. I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Well...

29:46.718 --> 29:47.749
You're up.

29:47.927 --> 29:49.967
What are you gonna do?

29:50.221 --> 29:52.212
Die, I guess.

29:53.306 --> 29:57.883
After today, I probably won't
be able to work anymore, so...

29:58.060 --> 30:00.845
- Did you get a second opinion?
- They double-checked the biopsy.

30:01.019 --> 30:02.478
No, by another neurosurgeon.

30:02.646 --> 30:05.562
There's gotta be a clinical trial
going on someplace.

30:05.731 --> 30:07.771
Yeah. Looking into it.

30:09.442 --> 30:11.433
Looks like they need you.

30:13.444 --> 30:15.686
Are you gonna be okay?

30:16.322 --> 30:18.989
Stupid question, Carter.

30:19.156 --> 30:20.401
Do me a favor.

30:20.574 --> 30:24.784
Try and keep the rumors from spreading
before I get a chance to talk to Elizabeth.

30:24.952 --> 30:26.032
Sure.

30:37.794 --> 30:41.493
- Do you know what time it is?
-2:47.

30:41.671 --> 30:44.837
- Correct, but it's not the right answer.
- It's not?

30:45.007 --> 30:48.042
No, the right answer is "yes" or "no. "

30:48.217 --> 30:51.004
Yes or no when possible.
Don't elaborate.

30:51.178 --> 30:53.004
Not all questions
have a yes or no answer.

30:53.179 --> 30:57.507
I understand. Yes or no
when possible. Don't elaborate.

30:57.682 --> 31:00.172
We don't win cases in deposition,
but we can lose them.

31:00.350 --> 31:03.303
At best, this stain follows you
for the rest of your career.

31:03.477 --> 31:05.849
At worst, you lose your license.

31:06.021 --> 31:08.772
We're not here to win an argument.
This is about information.

31:08.940 --> 31:11.691
He's looking to gain information
to use against you in court.

31:11.858 --> 31:15.191
We're looking to limit that information.

31:15.694 --> 31:17.935
You mean hide the truth.

31:18.279 --> 31:20.188
I didn't say that.

31:23.866 --> 31:26.701
How many do you think? Stitches?

31:26.869 --> 31:30.532
- Four. Five.
- Five?

31:30.704 --> 31:34.949
You're so good at this.
You're so gentle.

31:36.167 --> 31:37.198
Thank you.

31:37.376 --> 31:43.009
It's hard to believe because you
have such great, big, masculine hands.

31:45.256 --> 31:47.378
Sit still. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

31:47.549 --> 31:50.383
Eyelash. See?

31:50.551 --> 31:53.800
Okay, now you have
to make a wish and blow.

31:53.970 --> 31:55.713
That's all right.

31:55.888 --> 31:59.053
Okay.
I'll blow for you.

32:00.724 --> 32:04.306
What did you wish for? Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

32:04.477 --> 32:07.346
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry for what?

32:07.520 --> 32:09.144
It's part of the disease.

32:12.816 --> 32:17.191
Yes. We're going to now apologize for
your diseased mother, are we? Are we?

32:17.361 --> 32:20.858
She's always misbehaving. Abby never
wanted me around her friends.

32:21.029 --> 32:22.606
- She was always ashamed.
- Stop it.

32:22.780 --> 32:23.896
Ashamed and embarrassed.

32:24.074 --> 32:26.065
- You think I don't know?
- Let him finish your hand.

32:26.241 --> 32:28.909
You would walk right by me
and pretend you didn't know me.

32:29.077 --> 32:32.326
- You'd pretend I didn't exist.
- Let him finish your hand and shut up!

32:32.496 --> 32:34.570
- Don't sass me! I'm your mother!
- Not by choice.

32:35.873 --> 32:39.655
Okay. All right. Okay!
Do you want a 5 of Haldol?

32:39.833 --> 32:43.450
- No! Abby, I'm sorry! Abby, I'm sorry.
- Do you want 5 of Haldol?

32:43.627 --> 32:47.043
- I don't want Haldol!
- Behave, and we won't give you anything.

32:47.214 --> 32:50.083
Don't! You let me go!
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

32:50.257 --> 32:53.341
I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

32:53.509 --> 32:55.715
I am leaving!

32:55.886 --> 32:57.344
No! No!

33:02.181 --> 33:06.261
- You want a 5 of Haldol?
- Get restraints, stat! Start an IV!

33:06.435 --> 33:10.929
Abby! Abby! Abby, no!
Don't let them do this to me! Abby!

33:11.104 --> 33:13.262
- Don't let them...
- Starting a line with saline.

33:13.439 --> 33:15.597
Here! Arm restraints!

33:16.275 --> 33:18.481
Okay, call Psych.
Put her on the monitor.

33:19.194 --> 33:23.237
Please! Please don't let them
do this, Abby!

33:23.405 --> 33:26.938
- Come on, Maggie. Calm down.
- No!

33:29.033 --> 33:34.702
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Don't! Don't!

33:35.621 --> 33:39.831
You're my daughter, you little bitch!
Make them stop!

33:47.962 --> 33:51.911
They're ready to start again.
You okay? You look a little peaked.

33:52.091 --> 33:53.253
I'm fine.

33:53.425 --> 33:54.835
We're getting to the critical stage.

33:55.009 --> 33:57.166
If you don't feel you can
maintain your composure-

33:57.343 --> 34:01.589
- No. No, I want to get this over with.
- Okay.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.558
- What's he doing here?
- It's his deposition.

34:11.728 --> 34:15.428
He has a right to be here, like you
have a right to be at our depositions.

34:15.606 --> 34:18.178
- Don't they have to tell us?
- He's here to rattle you.

34:18.358 --> 34:22.141
- Just stay calm. Pretend he's not there.
- Pretend he's not there.

34:22.319 --> 34:24.690
- Don't let it affect your testimony.
- Ready to start?

34:24.862 --> 34:26.938
Yes. Okay?

34:42.540 --> 34:44.081
You removed the restraints?

34:44.248 --> 34:48.116
I can admit her voluntarily, but she
doesn't meet the criteria for a hold.

34:48.293 --> 34:52.125
- She ran through a plate-glass window.
- An accident. She's not gravely disabled.

34:52.297 --> 34:54.704
- Not a danger to herself or others.
- That's debatable.

34:54.882 --> 34:58.333
She's rapid-cycling. Probably
experiencing a drug-induced mania.

34:58.510 --> 35:02.174
- Blood alcohol's 0.092.
- Well, that'll do it.

35:02.346 --> 35:04.384
So do you want me to admit her?

35:05.347 --> 35:08.182
- I don't care.
- Okay, I'll do it.

35:08.350 --> 35:10.140
She wants to talk to you.
She's remorseful.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.431
- She wants to apologize.
- No, thank you.

35:12.602 --> 35:14.013
Okay.

35:14.604 --> 35:16.347
- Abby, I'm sorry.
- Hey, Maggie...

35:16.522 --> 35:19.272
- I'll go in the hospital. I'll get better.
- Go back inside.

35:19.439 --> 35:21.148
- Back to bed.
- I'll get better.

35:21.216 --> 35:26.217
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I'll get better. I'll get better.

35:30.572 --> 35:34.865
Get some frozen peas. Reuse them every
four hours on your face for 20 minutes.

35:35.034 --> 35:37.191
You can take some
ibuprofen for the pain.

35:37.368 --> 35:41.235
I want you to come back for a recheck.

35:41.413 --> 35:45.160
Hey, he was my nephew.
You knew I had to do something.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.378
LOL, complains of weakness...

35:52.546 --> 35:54.999
- Yeah. Good luck.
- ... while under a hair dryer.

35:55.171 --> 35:58.042
Ma'am, were you having
any chest pain or shortness of breath?

35:58.216 --> 36:00.587
No, dear.
The dryer was just set too high.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.083
Okay. EKG, CBC, Chem-7
and get a chest.

36:03.261 --> 36:06.177
- I'll be right with you, Mrs. Fruhman.
- Thank you, dear.

36:06.679 --> 36:09.763
They think they're gonna find
the shooters who killed Jesse.

36:09.932 --> 36:11.971
Good. I hope it helps.

36:14.227 --> 36:15.424
Yeah. Cleo...

36:17.270 --> 36:21.219
I got angry, you know?
And I got you angry.

36:21.398 --> 36:24.766
You're the only thing in my life
that makes sense right now.

36:24.942 --> 36:30.610
You know, I'm trying to say
I'm, you know, sorry.

36:30.779 --> 36:35.486
Buy me some dinner.
I'll consider your apology.

36:35.657 --> 36:38.991
Well, then in your medical opinion,
what caused the meningocele...

36:39.160 --> 36:42.777
...that cut off the blood supply
to Mr. Patterson's spinal cord?

36:42.954 --> 36:47.576
A leak of CSF, cerebrospinal fluid
from the dura,

36:47.611 --> 36:49.386
which covers the spinal canal.

36:49.458 --> 36:53.455
Which means you must have punctured
the dura during the procedure.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.916
That seems evident now, yes.

36:56.088 --> 36:59.372
- It wasn't evident during the procedure?
- No.

36:59.548 --> 37:03.296
- It was evident to the anesthesiologist.
- Objection. Argumentative.

37:03.468 --> 37:08.626
According to the operative report,
Dr. Babcock, the anesthesiologist...

37:08.804 --> 37:13.430
...drew your attention to spinal fluid
in the surgical field at 10 to 6.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.426
- Correct?
- No.

37:16.976 --> 37:20.142
- The note says 10 to 6, doesn't it?
- Yes.

37:20.312 --> 37:25.934
- So the report is wrong?
- No. He did draw my attention to fluid.

37:26.108 --> 37:29.476
- Fluid we now know to be spinal fluid.
- No.

37:29.652 --> 37:33.399
- What could it have been, doctor?
- Saline.

37:33.571 --> 37:38.481
But you understood the anesthesiologist
was concerned it might be spinal fluid?

37:38.658 --> 37:39.689
Yes.

37:39.867 --> 37:43.317
How did you satisfy
yourself that it wasn't?

37:43.494 --> 37:48.996
I suctioned the irrigation saline
and did not see any persistent CSF.

37:49.666 --> 37:50.828
Did you look?

37:52.042 --> 37:53.833
I can't operate without looking.

37:54.002 --> 37:57.665
Well, given that it was 10 to 6,
that you were in a hurry...

37:57.837 --> 38:00.506
...the nurse simultaneously
reminding you of your date-

38:00.673 --> 38:02.830
Objection. Can we get
to a question, Bruce?

38:03.007 --> 38:06.257
Did you perform a complete and
competent inspection of the field...

38:06.427 --> 38:09.925
...to ensure there were no CSF leaks?

38:13.723 --> 38:17.471
Sometimes leaks are so small
you cannot detect them visually.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.642
Nevertheless, did you perform
a thorough inspection?

38:20.810 --> 38:21.841
That's procedure.

38:22.020 --> 38:25.104
And you followed procedure
by performing a thorough inspection?

38:25.272 --> 38:26.814
Objection. Asked and answered.

38:26.982 --> 38:29.139
It's been asked.
It has not been answered.

38:29.317 --> 38:30.347
What was the question?

38:30.526 --> 38:33.644
Did you perform a thorough
and competent inspection...

38:33.819 --> 38:38.361
...specifically looking for possible
CSF leaks before you closed?

38:44.035 --> 38:45.694
Yes.

38:51.665 --> 38:55.199
- Where did you go? I was looking for you.
- I took a walk. Got a cup of coffee.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.948
- You didn't get my page?
- I knew what it was about.

38:58.128 --> 39:01.460
Legaspi was trying to find a bed
for your mom, and she just took off.

39:01.630 --> 39:03.289
I figured. Thanks.

39:03.464 --> 39:05.172
Thought you'd want
to check your apartment-

39:05.340 --> 39:06.371
She's not there.

39:07.092 --> 39:11.468
- You checked?
- No. This is the end of the cycle.

39:11.637 --> 39:13.261
Our cycle. She disappears.

39:13.430 --> 39:15.255
And for months,
I don't know where she is...

39:15.430 --> 39:17.304
...or what she's doing
or if she's alive.

39:17.474 --> 39:21.423
And then eventually, she'll turn up
somewhere, and I'll have to deal with it.

39:21.602 --> 39:24.601
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

39:24.770 --> 39:27.557
I knew how it would end
when she showed up.

39:30.233 --> 39:32.106
It's the dance we do.

39:32.274 --> 39:36.141
You get lost in it for a little while,
but it always ends the same.

39:37.404 --> 39:39.646
- Do you-?
- You ready?

39:39.823 --> 39:40.902
Yeah.

39:41.073 --> 39:45.022
Carter, I forgot to tell Weaver enzymes
are pending on Mr. Albe in 4.

39:45.201 --> 39:47.193
- I'll tell her.
- Thanks.

39:47.369 --> 39:48.483
Good night, Carter.

40:00.127 --> 40:03.081
- You coming in?
- I don't want to intrude.

40:03.255 --> 40:06.207
They're probably just eating.
Jackie makes so much food anyway.

40:06.507 --> 40:09.423
They need some time to themselves.
I'll wait for an invitation.

40:09.592 --> 40:12.924
All right. I'll just grab some stuff
for tomorrow. I'll be right back.

40:14.095 --> 40:16.087
Dr. Benton.

40:16.264 --> 40:17.674
What are you doing here?

40:17.847 --> 40:20.385
- I went to the store, like you said.
- Jackie see you?

40:20.558 --> 40:21.589
- No.
- You can't be here.

40:21.767 --> 40:24.720
The cops was hooking up the cousins.
They gonna think it was me!

40:24.894 --> 40:28.475
- Have you been home yet?
- No. They're gonna kill me! I'm dead!

40:28.646 --> 40:31.895
- Come on. Get in the car.
- I talked to the cops. I can't go home.

40:32.065 --> 40:36.275
- I told you this was gonna happen.
- Get in the car. I'll figure out something.

40:41.405 --> 40:43.195
Mark?

40:43.364 --> 40:45.273
I'm up here.

40:50.286 --> 40:53.570
- What are you doing?
- Just thinking.

40:54.996 --> 40:56.491
How did it go?

40:57.624 --> 40:59.450
Terribly.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.285
What happened?

41:10.633 --> 41:12.789
What? What is it?

41:15.719 --> 41:16.750
I lied.

41:17.762 --> 41:19.636
I lied.

41:21.806 --> 41:23.763
The fact is, I rushed.

41:23.933 --> 41:28.309
I rushed through and didn't inspect
the entire surgical field.

41:28.978 --> 41:30.803
That man will never walk again...

41:30.979 --> 41:34.679
...because I wanted
to get out early for the weekend.

41:34.857 --> 41:38.475
And I couldn't
even claim responsibility.

41:40.944 --> 41:46.897
I sat there, and I swore to God,
and I lied to save myself.

41:53.327 --> 41:55.155
God owes us one.

42:00.750 --> 42:03.998
I think you're allowed
to be selfish for a while.

42:23.348 --> 42:26.300
I didn't run into a street sign.

42:30.978 --> 42:32.638
I had a biopsy.

42:38.733 --> 42:44.634
Those headaches weren't from hockey.
