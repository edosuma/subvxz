00:02.000 --> 00:03.280
# Oh, Mandy

00:03.280 --> 00:07.720
# Well, you came
and you gave without taking

00:07.720 --> 00:09.880
# But I sent you away

00:09.880 --> 00:12.120
# Oh, Mandy

00:12.120 --> 00:17.000
# Well, you kissed me
and stopped me from shaking

00:17.000 --> 00:19.240
# And I need you today

00:19.240 --> 00:21.680
# Oh, Mandy! #

00:21.680 --> 00:26.160
This programme contains some
strong language and adult humour

00:26.160 --> 00:28.880
Back again, Mandy?Yeah.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.320
Why did you leave the job
at the frozen-fish factory?

00:31.320 --> 00:34.840
One of the other women who worked
there looked like Rose West.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.440
Gave me the right shivers.
Was it Rose West?No.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.280
They said her name
was Margaret Dodd.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.240
But she really
looked like Rose West.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.720
She had the glasses and everything.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.160
Could have been a professional
Lookie-likie, you know,

00:45.160 --> 00:48.320
open supermarkets and that.
Open supermarkets? As Rose West?

00:48.320 --> 00:51.000
I'm not convinced
it weren't Rose West.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Every time I saw her it gave me
a shock. It were doing me nerves in.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.360
First time I saw her,
I was rooted to the spot

00:56.360 --> 00:58.920
and held on to a breaded cod
so long it froze to me hand.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.880
They joked that I had
fish fingers, but...

01:01.880 --> 01:04.920
..I didn't think
that were very funny.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.400
Not when you think what she's
meant to have done. Yeah.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.440
Well, look, it wouldn't be the
first time you've left a job

01:11.440 --> 01:13.800
for unusual reasons, would it?
I don't know what you mean.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.800
Last month you gave up
a job at the Co-op

01:15.800 --> 01:18.040
because you thought you saw
an alien in the meat aisle.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.320
It were an alien! According to
the manager, it was a lollipop man.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.480
That's what they want you to think.
They're moving amongst us.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.600
I loved that job at the Co-op.
At the end of the day

01:26.600 --> 01:28.920
you could take home
all the cheese they hadn't sold.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.160
As you're aware, Mandy, that wasn't
actually the policy of the store.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.480
So they're still waiting
for you to reimburse them

01:34.480 --> 01:36.920
for the Â£79 worth of Edam.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.200
Before that,
you left a job in telesales

01:39.200 --> 01:41.200
because of the "pressures
of the commute".

01:41.200 --> 01:44.080
It were gruelling, all that travel!
Mandy, you were working from home.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.200
I had to get downstairs, didn't I?

01:46.200 --> 01:48.640
There's only so many jobs
you can leave for weird reasons

01:48.640 --> 01:51.680
before I'm forced to conclude
that you just don't like working,

01:51.680 --> 01:53.240
and I'll have to stop your benefits.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.400
Look, you've got a chance
to prove me wrong.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.880
This has just come in.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.080
A job at Brampton Hall,
the stately home.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.680
Mandy.What? It's a job
at Brampton Hall, the stately home.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.160
Brampton Hall, that's miles away.
I'll never...

02:11.920 --> 02:16.040
Is it working in the gift shop?
I'd like to work in a gift shop.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.760
All those key rings and fridge
magnets. Small bags of fudge.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.880
Rubbers. They will explain it
to you when you get there!

02:22.880 --> 02:24.160
I know them a bit,

02:24.160 --> 02:26.360
so I let them know that
you're going to start tomorrow.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.720
But, look, Mandy, I really
don't want to see you back here

02:28.720 --> 02:30.840
in a couple of days' time
with another mad excuse

02:30.840 --> 02:32.720
as to why you had to
give up the job.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.960
Otherwise, I will have to take
official action. Is that understood?

02:35.960 --> 02:39.320
Comprende.

Oh! Christ alive!

03:01.520 --> 03:03.720
You're late.

03:03.720 --> 03:07.960
You just have time to get into
your costume.Costume?

03:07.960 --> 03:14.080
It is 1887, and I'm the scullery
maid here at Brampton Hall.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.440
My jobs include lighting
the fires in the morning

03:17.440 --> 03:19.440
and polishing the horse brasses.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.760
Please come with me now as I guide
you through an ordinary day

03:22.760 --> 03:24.240
here at Brampton Hall.

03:27.160 --> 03:30.960
Excuse me.
Are these beams original?

03:30.960 --> 03:36.160
Beans? Beams. The beams.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.920
Oh, is that what they're called?
I just thought they were big logs.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.840
What was your question?
Don't worry about it.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.120
Right, if you'd like to follow me.
Through there's another old room.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.400
And this is the dining room.
I have to light the fire here

03:51.400 --> 03:55.360
at 5:30 every morning to make
sure it's warm for my master.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.280
Erm, hello. Who's the portrait of?

03:59.280 --> 04:02.200
Erm, that is the Duke of...

04:03.880 --> 04:05.240
..Dagenham.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.600
Who's the Duke of Dagen..?
If you'd like to follow me.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.400
Erm, excuse me.Oh, what now?!

04:10.400 --> 04:13.960
I was just wondering what period
the furniture in the house

04:13.960 --> 04:16.800
dates back from - is it Regency?

04:16.800 --> 04:19.640
Because, I mean, the fireplace
is clearly earlier...

04:19.640 --> 04:21.400
Look, the fireplace is from 1398.

04:21.400 --> 04:25.320
The curtains are from 1864,
and the ornaments are from 1972.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.760
That can't be right...

04:26.760 --> 04:28.840
This is the room where
John the Baptist was killed.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.200
CROWD: Ooh.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.680
And the Krays hid
in this closet here.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.320
Can you tell us
anything more about the Krays?

04:39.280 --> 04:41.000
Yeah. Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.280
Erm, Ronnie and Reggie Kray
used to love coming here,

04:44.280 --> 04:47.240
until they were sadly killed
one night in the drawing room

04:47.240 --> 04:51.160
for stealing an ashtray that
belonged to Michael Heseltine.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.920
Is it haunted?Haunted?

04:52.920 --> 04:55.240
I shit myself most days
with the stuff I see.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.400
Like what?See him?

04:59.440 --> 05:02.400
He follows me around.
What does he want?Fuck knows.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.640
Probably wants to get me
out of his house.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.280
Can you tell us anything else?

05:06.280 --> 05:07.840
Er, might do.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.280
What's it worth?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.960
Yeah. Erm, some days
I see orbs floating about.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.840
And when I see these,
I know shit's about to go down.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.000
Really?Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.160
I get dragged out of the scullery
by my ankles, screaming.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.000
Then why do you carry on working
here?Just love it here, you know.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.840
Love history and stuff.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.760
SNAPPING

05:31.880 --> 05:34.040
Do you want to go through?

05:42.640 --> 05:45.200
Oh! Fuck me,
where'd you come from?

05:45.200 --> 05:47.600
Ms Carter, here at Brampton Hall,

05:47.600 --> 05:52.600
we expect a certain level
of professionalism from our guides.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.280
Oh yeah, I'm really sorry.
I'll be on time tomorrow.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.760
I'm afraid you won't
be back tomorrow.

05:58.760 --> 06:03.080
I understand you've been
soliciting tips by making up

06:03.080 --> 06:05.040
stories about the Krays.No.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.120
I don't know who told you that.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.160
Oh, please don't send me
back to the Jobcentre.

06:11.160 --> 06:15.800
This is the best job I've ever had!
I'll give you one last chance.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.320
But perhaps you would like
to show your commitment

06:19.320 --> 06:22.080
by doing some overtime this evening.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.800
Yeah. Yeah, what is it?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.720
What, like a late-night tour
or something?

06:25.720 --> 06:29.280
We host a variety of events
here at the hall.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.360
One of them
is a book launch this evening.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.240
We need someone
to hand around the nibbles.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.320
Nibbles? Yes, please!

06:38.320 --> 06:41.480
Prosecco o'clock!

SHE LAUGHS

06:44.000 --> 06:45.360
Hiya, Lola.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.800
You couldn't pick me up tonight
from Brampton Hall at nine o'clock,

06:47.800 --> 06:49.720
could you? I've got to do overtime.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.880
But of course, Mandy! What are
friends for?Oh, thanks, Lola.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.440
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.200
Because we are such good friends,

06:56.200 --> 06:58.720
Mandy, I will only charge you
the same as UberCool.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.080
Plus 50%.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.800
But you can sit in the front.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.600
Thanks, Lola. See you later.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.720
She travels slowly.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.480
She carries nibbles.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.920
And other snacks.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.880
She brings confusion.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.680
Vol-au-vent? No.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.800
Do you want one?

08:28.000 --> 08:32.200
Got vegetarian options. That one's
beef. That one's salmon... Shhh!

08:32.200 --> 08:34.120
All right, please yourself!

08:35.480 --> 08:38.360
Nibbles? Oh. What've you got?

08:38.360 --> 08:41.240
Er, that one's beef, that one's
salmon, and that one's mushroom.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.240
Nah. You haven't got
any crisps, have you?

08:43.240 --> 08:45.800
I've got some cheesy footballs in
my boot, if you want some of those.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.640
Oh yeah, lovely. Yeah.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.520
What is going on?!

08:52.520 --> 08:55.280
You! Who are you?

08:55.280 --> 08:57.000
Mandy Carter.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.200
Been hired to do the nibbles.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.480
Oh.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.640
Well, please do so and leave.

How did you get here?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.320

We have waited many years
for your arrival.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.600
I was here bang on seven!

10:38.160 --> 10:41.160
Fuck me!

10:41.160 --> 10:45.960
For a thousand years, we have
waited for a suitable sacrifice.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.960
The victim must come
of their own free will.

10:48.960 --> 10:54.800
They must be empty of head
and they must be of virgin blood.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.080
We're actually going to overlook
that last one,

10:58.080 --> 11:00.120
because it's been a total
nightmare finding someone

11:00.120 --> 11:02.080
who ticks all the boxes.

11:02.080 --> 11:07.200
But, at last,
a victim has come to us.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.880

for somebody else!

What the devil is going on in here?

11:38.960 --> 11:41.000
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.360
Do you know what time it is?

11:42.360 --> 11:45.040
Playing silly games
when you should be at home!

11:45.040 --> 11:47.000
You! What are you playing at?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.600
My... My badminton got cancelled.
So I had a free evening...

11:49.600 --> 11:53.600
So you come here, terrorising women?
You make me sick!

11:53.600 --> 11:55.120
Get out of here!

11:55.120 --> 11:56.760
Hnnn!

You! Where do you
think you're going?

Er, I've got a stock-take
in t'morning.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.040
I should probably push off, too.
I've got an Ocado delivery.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.400
It's cheaper if you
get it delivered after nine.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.840
What in God's name...?

12:09.840 --> 12:12.120
Put on some clothes,
you dirty beasts!

12:13.400 --> 12:15.480
I suppose you're the ringleader?

12:15.480 --> 12:17.680
Johnny Big Bollocks.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.360
I have had only one
mission in this life.

12:20.360 --> 12:24.040
To worship Satan, and summon him
to our earthly plane!

12:24.040 --> 12:27.520
This was my last chance.
There's nothing for me here now.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.840
I seek to join my beloved Satan

12:29.840 --> 12:32.160
in the heat of the underworld!

12:32.160 --> 12:34.400
Arrrghhhh...

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
Oh, no, don't do...

Fake! Where did you get this?

12:39.920 --> 12:41.760
Amazon? No, actually.

12:41.760 --> 12:45.680
I like to support independent
retailers. Hnn! Come on.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.120
Let's get out of here.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.600
Actually... No point these
going to waste, is there?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.000
HE SIGHS

12:59.040 --> 13:01.000
So close!

13:04.200 --> 13:08.080
So, Mandy, back again?
What happened this time?

13:08.080 --> 13:11.680
You are not going to believe this.
I had to get out of Brampton Hall.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.920
They were all devil worshippers!
Into human sacrifice.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
They had me tied to an altar!

13:17.920 --> 13:20.840
I'm thinking of going to the local
papers about it, actually. Mandy...

13:20.840 --> 13:22.480
Mandy, just let me stop you there.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.160
Erm...your stories get more and more
ridiculous. But this new one.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.840
Devil worshippers?

13:27.840 --> 13:30.480
Listen, if you tell anyone
about this, they'll assume

13:30.480 --> 13:33.080
that you're just making this up
to get out of the job, OK?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.480
So promise me you'll never,
ever mention this again.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.720
We'll just say that the hours
weren't right for you

13:37.720 --> 13:40.560
or something, OK?All right.
Right. Well, er, look.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.680
Why don't you just come back
next week and we'll try

13:42.680 --> 13:44.400
and find you something else?

13:44.400 --> 13:46.800
But, please, no more
of these crazy stories,

13:46.800 --> 13:49.360
or I'm going to have to stop
your benefits.All right!

14:04.520 --> 14:06.160
Hi, Dean.
