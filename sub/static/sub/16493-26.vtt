I can't believe we're gonna get to see
Victor Verliezer in the flesh.

00:53.333 --> 00:56.166
He invented most of the technology
that we use today.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.583
-The V-Phone.
-Hello.

00:57.667 --> 00:58.792
-The V-Tablet.
-[beep]

00:58.875 --> 01:02.000
And V-Water.
It comes in a V-shaped bottle.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.792
Wow. He even makes
spilling water more efficient.

01:04.875 --> 01:07.959
If we meet him, I'm gonna tell him how he
inspired me to create this new app.

01:08.041 --> 01:10.000
I didn't know
you could program.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.417
Apparently, I cannot.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.959
It was supposed to
add an armadillo to any photo.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.959
But instead all it does is make this
annoying high-pitched sound.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.917
-[high-pitched sound]
-[all exclaiming]

01:18.000 --> 01:21.166
-Well, that is annoying.
-And high-pitched.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.083
There's gotta be
some use for it.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.000
Well, if anyone can think of one,
it's Victor Verliezer

01:27.000 --> 01:28.250
[music playing]

01:30.208 --> 01:32.917
[narrator] Newton, Galileo,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.959
Einstein, Verliezer.

01:35.041 --> 01:38.291
All of them changed
the way man thinks.

01:38.375 --> 01:41.458
But only one of them
changed the way man does.

01:41.542 --> 01:44.834
I'm referring, of course,
to Victor Verliezer.

01:44.917 --> 01:48.125
Ladies and gentlemen,
Victor Verliezer.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.458
[audience applauds]

01:50.041 --> 01:52.500
Hey, thank you.

01:52.583 --> 01:55.959
Ever since the 1950's,
we've been promised one thing.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.542
Robots!
Am I right?

01:57.625 --> 01:59.125
-[all cheer]
-[man] No, I wanted a flying car.

01:59.208 --> 02:02.000
And has anyone ever made good
on that imagined promise?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.375
-Actually, the Japanese have...
-[all] No!

02:05.458 --> 02:07.875
Until today.

02:07.959 --> 02:11.208
I present to you an invention that will
change everything forever.

02:11.291 --> 02:16.375
The Cybernetic Individual Domestic Droid
or C.I.D.D

02:16.458 --> 02:17.792
[C.I.D.D.] Hello, Doctor Verliezer.

02:17.917 --> 02:19.959
Hello, everyone.
I am C.I.D.D.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.375
[all] Hi, C.I.D.D.

02:21.458 --> 02:24.041
[C.I.D.D.] I just flew in
from Silicon Valley

02:24.125 --> 02:26.917
-and boy are my servos tired.
-[laughs]

02:27.000 --> 02:28.125
[all laugh]

02:28.208 --> 02:29.625
Isn't he fantastic?

02:29.709 --> 02:32.375
C.I.D.D is going
to revolutionize your life.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.083
How often have to tried
to peel a hard-boiled egg

02:35.166 --> 02:37.208
only to get those little
pieces of eggshell

02:37.291 --> 02:39.041
stuck under your fingernails?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.291
-Nope, never happened to me.
-I don't have a problem with that.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.458
C.I.D.D.

02:44.166 --> 02:45.000
[all] Ooh!

02:45.083 --> 02:47.250
He solved a problem I
didn't even knew I had.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.375
But wait, there's more!

02:48.458 --> 02:51.041
You there, in the
sweater vest and slippers.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.959
[laughs] Come on up here.
Yeah, right up here.

02:53.041 --> 02:53.875
[audience applauds]

02:53.959 --> 02:55.625
-Safety goggles.
-Way ahead of you.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.291
What do you like
more than anything?

02:59.375 --> 03:01.417
-My family.
-Card tricks, of course.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.000
[C.I.D.D.] Pick a card. Any card.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
[thuds]

03:06.083 --> 03:07.959
[C.I.D.D.] I am so sorry young man.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.083
I hope I did not hurt you.

03:10.166 --> 03:13.083
-You're a very polite robot, C.I.D.D.
-[C.I.D.D.] I try.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.917
Not to worry. C.I.D.D is well-equipped
for the unexpected.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.458
-[C.I.D.D.] Ow!
-[all gasp]

03:19.542 --> 03:20.959
You see, C.I.D.D can't
be knocked down.

03:21.041 --> 03:24.125
-[C.I.D.D.] Ow! Ow! Ow!
-And so advanced,

03:24.208 --> 03:26.083
he actually feels pain
while I hit him.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.458
[audience] Ooh!

03:28.542 --> 03:30.083
And he can multi-task.

03:30.166 --> 03:33.417
He can juggle, do your taxes
and make a perfect souffle.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.959
[C.I.D.D.] Do you have any business
expenses you'd like to deduct?

03:36.041 --> 03:38.083
Gosh, no.
But I do love souffles.

03:38.166 --> 03:40.625
Where did you learn
how to do all this cool stuff?

03:40.709 --> 03:41.625
[C.I.D.D.] From... From...

03:41.709 --> 03:44.500
[electronic whirring]

03:44.583 --> 03:48.000
-[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero. Must find zero.
-Ah...

03:48.083 --> 03:50.000
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
C.I.D.D is just a prototype.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.125
[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero...

03:51.208 --> 03:53.166
And we are still working out
a few of the kinks.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.291
That's the end of our
presentation. Goodbye.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.375
[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero.
Must find zero.

03:57.041 --> 03:59.166
[indistinct chatter]

03:59.250 --> 04:00.542
Do you know how bad
this makes me look?

04:00.625 --> 04:02.667
I thought we got rid of
that "zero-zero" nonsense.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.166
We did a full memory wipe!

04:04.250 --> 04:06.000
Well, do it again.

04:06.083 --> 04:08.291
[C.I.D.D.] C.I.D.D must find zero-zero.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.041
Guards,
restrain him!

04:10.125 --> 04:11.083
[grunting]

04:13.208 --> 04:15.375
Why did that idiot teach him
how to juggle?

04:15.458 --> 04:16.875
What idiot?

04:16.959 --> 04:18.125
Get him!
Zap that little trash can.

04:18.208 --> 04:21.500
[C.I.D.D.] Ow! Ow!
Ow! I feel pain.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.583
Please do not erase me.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.041
No!

04:25.125 --> 04:28.041
[Victor] That's my knee.
That's my other knee.

04:28.125 --> 04:31.333
[C.I.D.D.] Help me.
Help me, help me.

04:31.417 --> 04:32.250
To the V-Carts!

04:36.959 --> 04:38.875
Guys, we need to help C.I.D.D.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.875
-What do you mean?
-C.I.D.D said, "Help me."

04:40.959 --> 04:43.083
Whoa, wait. Was he scared?
How did he say it?

04:43.166 --> 04:44.166
Like this.
[robotic voice] Help me!

04:44.250 --> 04:47.500
Well, I guess it is hard
to tell with a robot.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.208
You raise
an interesting question.

04:49.291 --> 04:50.917
Are his feelings real,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.166
or has he just been programmed to mimic
the emotions of humans?

04:53.250 --> 04:55.375
This will raise important
ethical questions

04:55.458 --> 04:59.000
as artificial intelligence becomes more
prevalent in our society.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.041
Nobody cares, Jim.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.166
[panting]

05:04.250 --> 05:05.250
The tracks lead in here.

05:05.333 --> 05:08.458
Oh, no. They're having
a Lumberjack Festival today.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.083
What's the matter with that?
Don't you understand?

05:10.166 --> 05:13.083
I was the lead singer
of the Lumberzacks.

05:13.166 --> 05:15.208
I'll be mobbed.

05:15.291 --> 05:18.041
I have a huge following among
the lumberjack community.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.208
-The lumberjack community?
-It's a thing.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.166
That you're not a part of.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.125
I'm telling you, it's gonna
happen any minute.

05:26.208 --> 05:29.375
They're gonna recognize me
and it will be mayhem.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.208
-Hey! I know you.
-Oh, no. Here it comes.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.208
We went to elementary
school together.

05:34.291 --> 05:37.041
Okay, maybe not them.
But it will happen.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.917
You sure C.I.D.D was saying
he needs to find zero-zero?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.291
What's that even mean?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.875
Wait a minute!

05:42.959 --> 05:45.250
Fish, hamburger, balloon.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.458
No, that doesn't mean
anything. Let's try again.

05:46.542 --> 05:50.667
Center, graph, origin...

05:52.333 --> 05:53.417
[gasps] Of course.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.000
The center of an XY graph
is called zero-zero.

05:56.083 --> 05:59.291
-But it's also called...
-The origin.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.125
C.I.D.D is looking
for his origin.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.834
You mean like where
he came from?

06:02.917 --> 06:05.083
But everyone knows
his creator is Victor Verliezer.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.667
Just like everyone knows that I'm the lead
singer of the Lumberzacks.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.917
Really? Nothing?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.333
Wait, wait. Didn't Victor Verliezer
used to work with a partner?

06:16.417 --> 06:18.333
Yes. Clyde Rickenbacker.

06:18.417 --> 06:20.166
It was a big story
when they broke up.

06:20.250 --> 06:23.166
What if, and just
go with me on this,

06:23.250 --> 06:24.917
what if Clyde is zero-zero?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.959
You're saying the man
who invented the V-V-Neck Sweater

06:27.041 --> 06:29.291
took credit for
someone else's work?

06:29.500 --> 06:31.417
Well, there's one way
to find out.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.417
Find Clyde Rickenbacker.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.709
Did it. He's right
over there. Boo!

06:36.542 --> 06:38.083
How did you do that?

06:38.166 --> 06:41.166
He just posted a selfie
and we're in the background.

06:41.250 --> 06:45.166
[Milo] C.I.D.D, the robot,
Please come to security booth 12.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.125
Zero-zero is looking for you.

06:47.208 --> 06:50.291
I repeat, zero-zero
is looking for you.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.083
So now, supposedly,
this robot with human emotions

06:53.166 --> 06:55.125
is gonna come running
up here to reunite with...

06:55.208 --> 06:56.333
-[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero?
-[yelps]

06:59.417 --> 07:02.166
-C.I.D.D!
-[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.083
[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.041
Oh, thank you for finding
my robot, children.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.333
Here are some free gift cards.

07:12.417 --> 07:13.375
Cool, I can upgrade my V-Phone.

07:13.458 --> 07:16.542
Zack!
You no longer have our admiration.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.208
Oh! Ouch!

07:18.291 --> 07:20.125
C.I.D.D wants to be
with me, Victor.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.542
Well, it's not up
to him, is it, Clyde?

07:22.625 --> 07:24.500
Hello, Mr. Verliezer.
Zack Underwood.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.625
Big fan. I want to show you a little app
that I've invented.

07:26.709 --> 07:29.125
It's gonna be huge.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.500
Zack, not now.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.125
No, no.
This is exactly the right time.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.208
See, it's called
the Zack App.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.625
You just push this little
button like so...

07:36.709 --> 07:37.667
-[high-pitched sound]
-Ow!

07:37.750 --> 07:39.333
-So annoying! Ah!
-And high-pitched!

07:39.417 --> 07:42.125
[beeping]

07:42.208 --> 07:43.375
Come on C.I.D.D.
This way.

07:43.417 --> 07:44.333
After those kids.

07:44.417 --> 07:46.542
And the old man and the robot.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.041
After all of them.

07:50.041 --> 07:52.375
Huh. Zack from the Lumberzacks,

07:52.458 --> 07:54.417
right here in my
security booth.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.333
We're never gonna be able
to outrun them.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.250
But we might be able
to out-roll them.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.375
I learned how to log-roll when
I was with the Lumberzacks.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.250
It's very hard to master
and takes lots of hours of...

08:09.583 --> 08:10.667
Oh, okay. Never mind.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.291
Let's see if your V-Carts
can do this.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.000
[yelps]

08:20.083 --> 08:21.458
Wow! They can.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.500
Must be some kind of
gyroscopic stabilizing device.

08:24.583 --> 08:25.667
Very impressive.
Stop admiring him.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.208
[Milo and Zack] Sorry.

08:27.291 --> 08:28.125
This way!

08:54.709 --> 08:56.208
[exclaiming]

09:02.000 --> 09:03.166
[grunting]

09:04.333 --> 09:05.417
[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.583
Let go of him.
I built C.I.D.D and you know it.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.000
[C.I.D.D.] Zero-zero.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.291
You can erase his memory
a million times,

09:13.375 --> 09:15.333
but those early days
we spent together

09:15.417 --> 09:17.083
when I taught him to juggle,

09:17.166 --> 09:19.875
those are burned into
his hardware

09:19.959 --> 09:21.041
and you'll never get him
to forget me.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.917
Well, that's all very
touching, isn't it?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.583
But you signed away the
rights to all your inventions.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.166
So, C.I.D.D is mine.

09:28.250 --> 09:32.041
I'm a good inventor but
I'm a terrible businessman.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.458
I just don't know
the value of a dollar.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.500
This is like 63 cents, right?

09:36.834 --> 09:38.166
It's 100 pennies!

09:38.250 --> 09:40.417
How many times do we have
to have this conversation?

09:40.500 --> 09:43.250
So Clyde was the real genius and you're
making all the money?

09:43.333 --> 09:46.000
You wanna talk genius?
How about making people believe

09:46.083 --> 09:47.917
that they needed my
V-Co products?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.500
I mean look at this V-Phone 6.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.333
It's just smaller than the 5

09:51.417 --> 09:54.959
and bigger than the 4.
That is literally the only difference,

09:55.041 --> 09:56.959
and it's flying off the shelves.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.333
People have
different-sized pockets.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.125
People are sheep.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.041
People are stupid
gullible puppets

10:03.125 --> 10:04.333
that I can manipulate
at my whim.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.875
Who's the genius now?

10:06.959 --> 10:09.041
Actually it's still
Clyde because

10:09.125 --> 10:10.959
he dint just say a bunch
of horrible things about

10:11.041 --> 10:13.125
the public while we were
live streaming on our phones.

10:13.208 --> 10:14.458
People are sheep.

10:14.542 --> 10:16.458
People are stupid
gullible puppets

10:16.542 --> 10:18.959
that I can manipulate
at my whim.

10:19.041 --> 10:20.125
How insulting!

10:20.208 --> 10:22.375
I'm selling my V-Co
stock immediately.

10:22.458 --> 10:23.792
Yeah, I'm not a sheep.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.333
I'm gonna do exactly
what she was doing.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.291
[bleating]

10:27.375 --> 10:30.542
[clears throat] I'm sorry. I was trying to
say we have a bad connection.

10:30.625 --> 10:32.250
Sell my V-Co
stock immediately.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.208
Hey, there's an armadillo.

10:34.291 --> 10:35.333
It works!

10:35.417 --> 10:37.959
[phone rings]

10:38.041 --> 10:40.083
Mr. Verliezer, we just
went out of business.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.583
Wow! Things really happen
quickly in the digital age.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.083
[man] Oh! My lunch
was in there.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.000
[grumbling]

10:57.083 --> 10:58.500
[C.I.D.D.] Thank you,
Milo Murphy.

10:58.583 --> 10:59.875
I will remember you

10:59.959 --> 11:03.333
when the robots
take over the world!

11:03.417 --> 11:06.375
[laughs] Psych!
Just kidding.
