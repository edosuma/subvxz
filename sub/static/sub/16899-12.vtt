00:04.520 --> 00:08.729
Mr. Aikins received this from
a man who claims his daughter
worked here.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.394
"Daviant freak"?

00:10.440 --> 00:14.001
Control over my own trust. Let
me prove that I can do this.

00:14.050 --> 00:14.869
Alright.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.319
Your father's full name?

00:16.360 --> 00:17.315
Daniel Andrews.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.055
You said he was a veterinarian.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.351
That's news to me.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.924
Betty- How long before
you tell the truth?

00:22.970 --> 00:26.622
I'm trying to tell
a new story here.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.754
If you are interested.
I could manage to be much
less distant.

00:30.810 --> 00:33.153
Vera- I got demoted today
because of you.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.328
Well then, stay the hell
away from me, Vera.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.462
Mom?

00:38.510 --> 00:41.422
Father told me you were dead.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.813
Kate- Come on,
let's go to the cafe.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.950
Surprise!

00:52.830 --> 00:54.172
This is for you.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.439
Happy wedding.

00:57.490 --> 01:00.129
He'll make a honest
woman out of you.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.260
Are you surprised?

01:02.320 --> 01:03.742
I'll say.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.882
And who do we have here?

01:08.590 --> 01:10.069
This is my mom.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.971
Vera- Your mom?

01:35.790 --> 01:38.918
That's another drink for
the future Mrs. Ivan Buchinsky!

01:38.960 --> 01:40.393
I don't mind.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.182
I want a word with his
soon-to-be mother-in-law
anyway.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.050
Kate, isn't this amazing,

01:45.100 --> 01:48.445
your mom being here after all
this time thinking she pasted.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.538
Yeah.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.366
Betty- C'mon, shower-girl
needs a breather.

01:52.410 --> 01:53.889
Betty- Let's go again!

01:53.930 --> 01:56.933
I read in the engagement notice
that your husband's a vet.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.322
Vernon?

01:58.370 --> 02:00.418
Oh no, he was a pacifist.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.759
Now, Mother, stop teasing
Mrs. Corbett!

02:03.810 --> 02:05.459
It's our old family joke,

02:05.510 --> 02:08.377
"What d'you call a vet
who's never served?

02:08.430 --> 02:10.682
A veterinarian!"

02:10.730 --> 02:13.688
Plenty to be smile about now,
don't you, Mrs. Andrews?

02:13.740 --> 02:14.775
Yes.

02:14.830 --> 02:19.779
There's a spot in the game,
Mrs. C!

02:25.490 --> 02:28.186
If I'd known I'd cause
such a commotion.

02:28.230 --> 02:31.449
Don't worry about it
I'm only glad to see you.

02:31.490 --> 02:33.230
You were hard to find.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.180
Wasn't that the idea?

02:35.240 --> 02:38.459
I know, but I'd reason
to trouble the waters.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.799
Marion, I had a call from
a police detective.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.154
Kate- What did he want?

02:46.200 --> 02:50.159
To finish a conversation
you'd had about the
night your Father died.

02:50.210 --> 02:52.110
He thinks it was foul play.

02:52.170 --> 02:55.867
And he wants the truth about
your father's death.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.560
Bob- Relax, Lore, it's just
a blood drive.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.042
And guess who'll be there?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.318
I tell you, I can't
quite get my head around

03:10.360 --> 03:12.999
how they can draw
out your blood now

03:13.060 --> 03:16.223
and just save it
for someone else.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.181
Guess I don't_care much for
doctors makIng advances,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.663
however you square it.

03:21.720 --> 03:27.158
Well, if we have boys
leaking blood all over the
African sands,

03:27.200 --> 03:31.022
we're damn luclq they found ways
to fill them back up again.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.208
Suddenly you're a big
believer in modern medicine.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.037
Patel says he can improve
these legs:

03:37.080 --> 03:40.868
exercises, electricity
on the muscles...

03:40.910 --> 03:42.958
That "doctor" is selling
you snake-oil,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.218
trading on your hopes
to nab our girl.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.478
You can't rewrite thirty years.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.691
Oh I'd say we can.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.231
Vera- You okay, Mrs. Corbett?

04:07.290 --> 04:10.930
I can't believe they go in
there and draw out half the
blood God gave you.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.379
We only take ten percent, Mom.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.729
You joining the line or
just holding it up?

04:14.770 --> 04:16.374
I'm busy corralling the workers.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.728
Now I know why it's
called a blood drive.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.293
That's quite the system.

04:20.340 --> 04:22.649
Well, with nearly nine
thousand wounded allies

04:22.690 --> 04:25.386
in that North African
desert, we need it.

04:25.430 --> 04:29.560
To think our blood will be
winging it across the Atlantic
and within 48 hours,

04:29.610 --> 04:32.340
pumping through
the veins of our boys.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.399
Visclovski, McRae, and Perrault?

04:37.450 --> 04:40.487
Your turn to donate blood.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.098
Mine too, Mrs. Corbett.

04:42.150 --> 04:43.629
Didn't you give already?

04:43.670 --> 04:45.979
Oh, I'd remember if I did.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.011
Oh dear, I'm really
dropping the ball.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.401
You're juggling a lot.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.282
Boy, with this
Operation Supercharge,

04:54.330 --> 04:56.503
Montgomery's throwing
everything he can at 'em.

04:56.550 --> 04:58.541
Three years,
Rommel's gone undefeated.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.761
Well, we got 'em on the run now.

05:00.820 --> 05:04.722
You watch, the ole Desert Fox'll
be chewing on sand in no time.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.338
Might want to look away.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.995
There, you're done.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.349
Mr. Parry.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.608
Now there's something
I can set eyes on.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.345
Sheila- Count to sixty
before you get up.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.789
Wish you'd been here earlier.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.389
One look from you and the blood
drains right out of me.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.701
Aren't you a card.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.012
It's my low blood-pressure.

05:25.060 --> 05:26.880
What's your game now,
Mr. Parry?

05:26.930 --> 05:28.056
None left to play.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.839
My stint here is winding up.

05:29.890 --> 05:32.199
What, the war ended
and nobody told me?

05:32.240 --> 05:34.014
I'll be assigned
another job elsewhere.

05:34.070 --> 05:39.372
I'd hope by now you can
trust me to know where
to send a postcard.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.671
C'est la guerre.

05:42.770 --> 05:46.900
Easy, you haven't
waited your minute.

05:46.950 --> 05:48.941
I'm stronger than I look.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.343
"Cheerio."

05:51.390 --> 05:53.608
After work.
Testing field.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.995
You'll have a glimpse of
what I've been all about.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.130
Can't wait.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.657
Boy, look at all that.

06:05.710 --> 06:07.484
You'll want it on ice quick.

06:07.540 --> 06:09.269
Could be going to my brother,

06:09.320 --> 06:12.881
he's RAF, flying over the
Sahara right now.

06:12.930 --> 06:16.366
Sinking fuel-ships and cutting
supplies from Nazi tanks.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.672
You know a thing or two.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.893
I met a few RCAF.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.714
What's your brother's name?

06:21.770 --> 06:22.896
We call him Twill.

06:22.940 --> 06:23.508
Twill?

06:23.550 --> 06:24.505
Yeah.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.632
You don't forget a
name like that.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.499
Glad to hear he's
still kicking.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.857
What's your name?

06:29.910 --> 06:31.684
Vera Burr.

06:31.730 --> 06:33.869
Twill wrote about you.

06:33.910 --> 06:38.176
He said there's no
gal better at bucking
up a soldier.

06:38.220 --> 06:40.859
Is that what he called it.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.878
Oh hey, I meant it
as a compliment!

06:50.930 --> 06:52.886
Ivan.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.364
Apparently I gotta go have
the life drained outa me.
Kiss for good luck?

06:55.410 --> 06:58.971
I need to tell you something
before one of the other girls
starts spilling.

06:59.020 --> 07:01.807
Uh-oh. You get into trouble
at your shower last night?

07:01.850 --> 07:03.898
Ivan, I haven't been
entirely honest.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.896
It's my mother.
She's alive.

07:05.940 --> 07:06.725
What?

07:06.770 --> 07:08.761
I just found out yesterday.

07:08.810 --> 07:12.940
How can she be,
not dead all of a sudden?

07:12.990 --> 07:15.777
My father wasn't a good
man. He lied, Ivan,

07:15.820 --> 07:18.038
and told me that my mother died.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.777
When it was all to cover
his pride that she'd
gone and left him.

07:21.830 --> 07:23.912
What kind of man
lies about that?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.040
It's hard to explain.

07:25.090 --> 07:27.479
Try.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.226
I hate to tell you this way.

07:30.270 --> 07:32.488
But, see, my name's not Kate.

07:32.530 --> 07:35.181
Aikens- Miss Andrews!
I got a gent waiting to see you.

07:35.230 --> 07:37.494
Detective.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.700
Detective?

07:38.760 --> 07:40.489
Come on.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.362
What are you doing now?

07:46.420 --> 07:47.842
Looking for a good vein.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.982
And how do you know
when it's good?

07:50.030 --> 07:52.021
Best ones are in the
antecubital fossa.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.026
Visible, well supported
and with a large lumen.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.035
What's a lumen?

07:56.080 --> 07:57.297
Mother?

07:57.340 --> 08:00.992
You're right, I don't
want to know.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.644
But they're sure this is safe?

08:02.690 --> 08:04.646
If you don't want to help out,

08:04.700 --> 08:06.782
there's plenty of other
people who can.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.821
I'm doing this,
Sheila, and I'm here.

08:08.870 --> 08:10.918
Just get it over with.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.354
You're good.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.482
Top of nursing school,
I bet.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.145
Turning all kinds of heads.
Teachers, doctors.

08:22.190 --> 08:23.589
I've turned Narendra's head.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.234
That's good enough for me.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.360
I didn't mean...

08:26.410 --> 08:27.843
You're still hoping that
I'll do better.

08:27.890 --> 08:30.893
you should know that
I've quit looking.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.498
You don't worry you'll get hurt?

08:32.550 --> 08:35.804
I'm not going to stop seeing
a man, just because

08:35.860 --> 08:39.034
he's one of the things out
there that scares you.

08:46.650 --> 08:50.347
Fresh air and stout,
does the trick.

08:50.390 --> 08:52.529
What's it going to like
in there for me now?

08:52.570 --> 08:54.299
As far as VicMu is concerned,

08:54.350 --> 08:57.308
your gravest sin was
missing a day's work.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.782
Thank you.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.308
When I say to you
"don't mention it".

09:01.360 --> 09:04.488
You mean, don't mention it.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.576
A man I know once said,

09:06.630 --> 09:10.145
there's nothing more
exhilarating than to be
shot at and missed.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.589
You got yourself another
chance, Mr. Moretti.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.188
Make it count.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.117
I hear congratulations
are in order.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.559
I'm getting married, yes.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.512
IfI hadn't seen your
picture in the paper

09:27.560 --> 09:30.427
with this new name of yours,
I'd've never found you.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.859
I would have been in
touch if I thought I
could help.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.219
Your father's injuries
tell us he fell backwards.

09:37.270 --> 09:38.692
Any ideas how?

09:38.750 --> 09:40.479
Must have lost his balance.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.442
Our tests_ show he
wasn't a drinking man.

09:43.490 --> 09:44.616
Never touched the stuff.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.149
So what happened?

09:47.760 --> 09:51.014
Sir, none of us likes it
when a man dies alone,

09:51.060 --> 09:53.494
but when my father went?

09:53.540 --> 09:56.839
It was just him and his Maker.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.633
Yes.

10:01.030 --> 10:03.419
Except your father was
covered with a canvas tarp,

10:03.470 --> 10:05.938
like a sleeping baby.

10:05.990 --> 10:07.901
He didn't die alone.

10:07.950 --> 10:09.679
Someone was with him.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.733
Someone who wanted
to cover It all up.

10:23.230 --> 10:25.448
You've gone a bit pale.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.447
I gave blood today.

10:30.490 --> 10:31.149
Oh.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.578
No please, come in.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.791
Thank you, Miss Rowley.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.502
Miss Rowley, I know
where you are now.

10:47.420 --> 10:50.036
You didn't know her
real name either.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.115
"Real" name?

10:53.690 --> 10:56.386
Lot of girls come from other
places, reinvent themselves.

10:56.430 --> 10:59.035
So long as they do their work,
don't cause trouble...

10:59.090 --> 11:01.786
Marion Rowley is the daughter
of a street preacher

11:01.830 --> 11:04.390
who died under suspicious
circumstances.

11:08.010 --> 11:10.478
Kate's a good girl,
Detective Brodie.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.184
What a sight.

11:14.230 --> 11:17.404
Before the war, who'd
have thought women could
work like this.

11:17.450 --> 11:20.328
We've proved we're
as capable as men.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.326
Yes.

11:22.370 --> 11:25.897
I'm starting to think you're
capable of just about anything.

11:37.210 --> 11:39.815
Blood drive's over for
today, come back tomorrow.

11:39.870 --> 11:41.826
I'm here to see you, Vera.

11:41.870 --> 11:44.657
Well I'm not here for
you, Marco. Not anymore.

11:44.700 --> 11:45.997
You nearly sunk us both.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.211
The guys you fell in with,
that guy Frankie?

11:48.270 --> 11:50.226
Is in jail. And I'm
done with that.

11:50.270 --> 11:54.001
It's over. I promise.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.745
Now please, let me
make it up to you.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.700
What'd you have in mind?

11:58.760 --> 12:00.534
Figured I'd pop by tonight.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.797
Did you?

12:01.850 --> 12:02.589
Yeah.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.018
Say eleven-thirty?

12:04.070 --> 12:05.844
Can I say no to that?

12:05.890 --> 12:08.632
Why yes I can. I don't
need a Midnight Man.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.285
Oh why? 'Cause you found a
Midnight Pipsqueak?

12:11.330 --> 12:14.811
That half-pint soldier
you were chatting up?

12:14.860 --> 12:17.909
Life's more than a parade
of randy service men.

12:25.090 --> 12:28.469
You need a better gambit than
leading a girl to nowhere

12:28.530 --> 12:31.658
and ruining her shoes while
you play Man of Mystery.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.839
I can't tell you
where I'm going...

12:33.880 --> 12:36.440
but I can show you
why I've been here.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.481
Is this one of my
father's tins?

12:38.540 --> 12:40.223
Patience and I
will show you.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.225
Show me what? A blob
of plasticine?

12:42.280 --> 12:43.702
Not quite. That's dangerous.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.842
Well I'm tired of your secrets,
Clifford.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.107
Give it to me!

12:47.150 --> 12:48.879
Not till you start
shooting straight.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.371
What are you doing
get off me!

13:06.610 --> 13:08.953
Did somebody just bomb us?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.252
Yes. You did.

13:11.310 --> 13:12.299
What on earth...?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.093
Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine.

13:19.270 --> 13:20.180
In English, please?

13:20.230 --> 13:21.481
RDX.

13:21.530 --> 13:23.578
Research Department Explosive.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.839
Uses a fraction _of the materials
and packs twrce the punch.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.972
Hitler won't know what hit him.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.191
I know I didn't.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.629
We're using it in the
Sahara right now.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.762
And we advanced this in our lab?

13:34.810 --> 13:37.062
Yes. I'd hoped my
demonstration here would

13:37.120 --> 13:39.372
be somewhat more, controlled.

13:39.420 --> 13:41.638
And the tin, my father's design.

13:41.690 --> 13:44.853
So Operatives can carry it
discreetly behind enemy lines.

13:44.910 --> 13:46.332
Why show me this?

13:46.390 --> 13:49.120
And I hate the thought
of leaving without you

13:49.170 --> 13:51.343
knowing what we are all about.

13:51.390 --> 13:53.995
Well, next time you're looking
to turn a girl's head...

13:54.050 --> 13:58.259
make sure she doesn't
nearly blow It off first.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.927
Here it is.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.744
Elizabeth McRae

14:12.370 --> 14:13.883
"Betty McRae...

14:13.940 --> 14:18.673
Deviant freak. Seduced my
daughter, Marion Rowley."

14:20.680 --> 14:22.728
Lorna? What are you doing?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.375
What have you got there?

14:35.480 --> 14:38.085
Easy going, Ivan.

14:38.130 --> 14:39.779
You're down a pint of blood.

14:39.830 --> 14:42.082
That's one way to
save money on beer.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.700
I know I threw a lot at you.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.570
Do I call you "Marion" now?

14:46.620 --> 14:47.837
No!

14:47.880 --> 14:52.704
Ivan, I'm still Kate
to anyone who matters.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.627
And the cop?

14:55.670 --> 14:58.138
Why's he think your dad's
death was suspicious?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.236
I don't know.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.359
Honest.

15:01.420 --> 15:05.595
Was your dad even
a veterinarian?

15:05.640 --> 15:08.507
Was he?

15:11.990 --> 15:16.939
You saw the scars on my back.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.515
He was supposed to
be a man of God.

15:20.570 --> 15:23.084
And I'm ashamed, Ivan...

15:23.130 --> 15:26.873
of everything that I come from.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.787
And if you knew you
wouldn't blame me.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.479
I'm still the same girl.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.196
You'll be a Buchinsky soon.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.806
I just want our life to start.

15:46.850 --> 15:49.375
So we take the train
to Winnipeg.

15:49.420 --> 15:50.899
What, and get married there?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.281
New job,

15:52.340 --> 15:54.945
new home... it's a lot
cheaper out there.

15:54.990 --> 15:56.161
Run away?

15:56.210 --> 16:00.601
It's not running away
if you're going home.

16:00.650 --> 16:01.901
Let's do it.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.952
Everything will be better
once we're out there.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.659
Glady, here I am entertaining
at your hotel.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.315
You'd asked for more
of your winter clothes.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.702
Did Mother bring my coats?

16:17.750 --> 16:20.275
I was feeling a chill
on the way home from work,

16:20.320 --> 16:22.538
A nip of brandy will
warm those bones.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.069
Come on in.

16:24.110 --> 16:26.749
I'll have a bellman bring up
your luggage up from the car.

16:26.810 --> 16:29.028
What are you doing
entertaining at The Hedley?

16:29.070 --> 16:32.858
I'm here with some
military assoaates who
depart soon for overseas.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.368
We're celebrating
a job well done.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.854
Clifford Parry, is he here?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.686
How well do you know him?

16:39.730 --> 16:41.812
A few dust-ups on factory turf,

16:41.870 --> 16:43.519
nothing to speak of.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.950
Gladys, dear! I was just
waxing on about you.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.604
You know Clifford Parry.

16:48.650 --> 16:51.608
Miss Witham. Nice to see
you out of the factory.

16:51.660 --> 16:55.391
Mr. Parry was telling me how
he helped back Churchill
against Lord Halifax.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.967
Imagine the pickle we'd be
in if our British Bulldog
hadn't prevailed.

16:59.010 --> 17:03.094
No doubt we have you to
thank for the defence
of the free world.

17:03.150 --> 17:05.971
Your father is lending us great
help in our latest round.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.100
Something about the container,

17:07.150 --> 17:08.936
that's all they'll tell us gals!

17:08.980 --> 17:10.288
I'm proud of you, Daddy.

17:10.330 --> 17:13.106
I have an inspiring force in
you, my dear.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.061
If this country had more
women like your daughter...

17:16.120 --> 17:19.078
the danger she faces
on a daily basis?

17:19.120 --> 17:22.590
Mr. Parry, I'll faint in your
arms if you're not careful.

17:22.650 --> 17:26.074
Perhaps, she could pursue your
line of work, Mr. Parry.

17:26.130 --> 17:28.735
[Laughing]

17:28.780 --> 17:31.340
What's so funny
about that Daddy?

17:31.390 --> 17:34.518
Not to worry, Gladys is
hardly intelligence material.

17:34.570 --> 17:37.300
What she has in moxie,
she lacks in judgment.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.999
You do know I'm standing
right next to you.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.962
I'm only saying, your parents
have nothing to worry about.

17:43.010 --> 17:46.969
I'm sure coming from a virtual
stranger, that's a great
relief.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.362
Come, Mr. Parry,

17:48.410 --> 17:50.970
let's freshen your drink
and go speak to the Major.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.147
It was a pleasure, Miss Witham.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.108
I'll give him moxie.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.321
He's luclq he's
leaving the country.

17:59.380 --> 18:00.631
Now, now.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.899
Mr. Parry told me he thought
you quite liked him.

18:03.950 --> 18:08.159
Something about an explosive
afternoon at work?

18:10.350 --> 18:13.035
Mr. Akins caught me red-handed.

18:13.090 --> 18:15.342
Looking at a girl's
employee records.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.119
There's nothing wrong with that.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.001
Except now he's gone and
taken what he found

18:20.050 --> 18:24.043
_in those files and
given it to the police.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.613
Damn it.

18:25.660 --> 18:28.663
Why didn't I just go and burn
the letter the first time,

18:28.710 --> 18:30.189
when I had a chance?

18:30.230 --> 18:33.017
It'll just shine a little
light into the dark.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.016
And who knows what'll
come crawling out?

18:35.070 --> 18:37.493
This could do your
girl some help.

18:37.550 --> 18:41.372
This preacher who wrote
it sounds like one hell
of a lunatic.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.729
This detective won't
see it that way.

18:43.770 --> 18:45.328
You don't know that, Lorna.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.154
We women, the jobs we do,

18:47.210 --> 18:51.328
he thinks it perverts a girl.
He's a man who hates us.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.517
I need to talk sense
into that detective.

18:56.090 --> 18:59.048
Seems a lot for a
lady to carry alone.

18:59.090 --> 19:00.250
It's just a mix-up.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.210
Bellhop brought it here
instead of my room.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.783
Nothing a fifty-cent
tip won't cure.

19:03.830 --> 19:04.876
Oh fifty cents?

19:04.920 --> 19:06.649
Well, I am between jobs now.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.053
It's a good time to
improve your discretion,

19:09.100 --> 19:10.920
learn how to talk to a girl.

19:10.970 --> 19:12.961
Gladys, let's be
nice to our friends.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.089
I'm sorry mother.

19:14.150 --> 19:17.233
Must have been a
residual belch of moxie.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.362
You want nice?
I'll give nice.

19:19.410 --> 19:20.672
Let's go, Jeeves.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.409
Until we meet again, Mr. Parry.

19:28.990 --> 19:31.458
Quincy- You sure
like your steak.

19:31.510 --> 19:33.899
I need it.

19:33.950 --> 19:35.679
I donated blood today.

19:38.170 --> 19:42.174
So, what else did your
brother say about me?

19:42.220 --> 19:45.269
That thinking of you gets
him through the dark,

19:45.310 --> 19:50.782
knowing there's girls like you
back home helps him fight.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.741
Well, that's sweet.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.314
You cutting his meat there,
Vera?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.009
This ain't your party.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.403
You're just doing this
to get me going.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.236
Don't flatter yourself.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.623
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.329
Is that right?

20:07.380 --> 20:11.760
Enough. Quincy, if he
doesn't shove off, we will.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.688
Let's go have some dessert.

20:22.220 --> 20:25.644
"My daughter has been
corrupted by your factory

20:25.700 --> 20:28.783
and your employees,
namely one Betty McRae."

20:28.830 --> 20:31.355
This man, he's a twisted soul.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.039
He was a pious, God-fearing man.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.445
And every father has the
right to protect and correct
his daughter.

20:37.490 --> 20:40.709
She sings for the
soldiers at the hospital.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.365
Two perfect angels.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.275
They may have made mistakes.

20:45.330 --> 20:47.457
Like what they did
to Vernon Rowley.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.287
Why are you dogging
them like this?

20:50.330 --> 20:53.675
Because I hate it when
people he to me.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.506
You know what, I
can always tell.

20:56.550 --> 20:59.110
Anything else you
want to say to me?

21:04.610 --> 21:07.124
Tip for services rendered?

21:07.170 --> 21:08.899
You want a tip, Clifford?

21:08.960 --> 21:12.782
Stop swanning around here like
a class-act with a plum in
your mouth.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.786
I was attempting to
protect your career.

21:14.830 --> 21:17.003
By belittling me to my parents?

21:17.050 --> 21:19.189
They already think
little enough.

21:19.230 --> 21:22.358
I need to keep it that way,
if you're to move forward.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.923
What is your big plan here?

21:23.970 --> 21:25.449
Your job's only beginning.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.365
What does that mean?

21:27.410 --> 21:28.229
What are you...

21:29.890 --> 21:31.289
Let go!

21:31.330 --> 21:32.149
My dress.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.896
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

21:40.250 --> 21:41.239
Take it off.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.033
You heard me.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.809
Take off your dress.

21:45.860 --> 21:46.906
I'll fix it.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.903
Boy, when you said dessert,

21:49.960 --> 21:51.951
I wasn't thinking a
plate of cookies.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.039
Sweetie, that's your
sugar ration and some.

21:56.090 --> 22:00.174
Never seen so many dresses.

22:00.230 --> 22:01.913
The coral o_ne's
my favourite.

22:01.970 --> 22:04.359
It's my best colour.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.798
Have you never been in a
girl's room before?

22:09.850 --> 22:11.795
No.

22:11.850 --> 22:16.935
And I'm figuring I'm only
here 50's to make
that fellow jealous.

22:16.980 --> 22:20.245
Yeah, he's one man who's
never coming back in here.

22:20.290 --> 22:21.678
Why's that?

22:22.510 --> 22:25.889
Well...

22:25.950 --> 22:29.989
let me tell you
about girls, Quincy.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.692
It's like your brother
flying over the Sahara.

22:33.740 --> 22:37.562
You need to know what
you're gunning for.

22:37.610 --> 22:39.601
You have to like her for her.

22:39.660 --> 22:42.527
Not just because she's
available.

22:42.570 --> 22:45.221
And you let her know
she's the special one,

22:45.270 --> 22:46.965
because if you don't?

22:48.670 --> 22:50.399
She moves on.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.999
Good night, Quincy.

23:19.780 --> 23:22.044
You run, Marion,
You'll get chased.

23:22.090 --> 23:24.138
I got myself free last time.

23:24.180 --> 23:25.306
You'll look guilty.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.523
I am guilty, Mom.

23:28.580 --> 23:30.741
I was there on his last night.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.143
He flew off in
one of his rages.

23:33.190 --> 23:35.533
I thought he was
going to kill me.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.660
And he fell.

23:36.710 --> 23:40.100
He fell from a height
and landed hard...

23:40.150 --> 23:42.459
and he died.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.195
I was afraid to say.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.320
Oh, Marion.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.280
And I should have come forward,
I know.

23:47.330 --> 23:50.458
And now it's too late.

23:50.510 --> 23:53.115
I'd rather take my
chances with Ivan.

23:58.650 --> 24:00.550
Okay, I understand.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.488
Impressive.

24:12.530 --> 24:17.092
I was a journalist,
then a soldier.

24:17.150 --> 24:19.277
You learn a thing or two.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.804
Thank you.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.060
You've a rare gift,

24:30.120 --> 24:34.500
you can navigate
different worlds.

24:34.560 --> 24:38.849
Your intelligence,
your patriotism,

24:38.910 --> 24:45.770
it hasn't darkened your spirit
the way it has some men.

24:45.830 --> 24:50.346
Half my job is
hiding what I feel.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.178
The shell never cracks.

24:55.230 --> 24:59.963
But I'm fighting for a time
when I won't need secrets.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.147
I only hope,

25:02.190 --> 25:04.795
I'll remember how to
live without them.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.896
You can turn around.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.609
You take care of my daughter,
you hear?

26:08.650 --> 26:11.210
I'll be out to Winnipeg to check
up on you soon.

26:11.260 --> 26:12.568
Yes, Ma'am.

26:12.610 --> 26:13.998
She's a special girl,
I'll take good care of her.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.915
We should get moving.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.473
I love you, Mom.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.039
I doubt anyone's
travelling tonight.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.523
I need to ask you a
few questions.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.354
My friend Betty's expecting us.

26:26.410 --> 26:29.925
Oh, Miss McRae is already
at the station.

26:29.970 --> 26:32.018
She doesn't have to go with you.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.618
Then I'll come back
with a warrant.

26:33.670 --> 26:35.274
A warrant? For what?

26:35.330 --> 26:37.195
I'll go, whatever you want.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.798
A warrant for what?!

26:38.850 --> 26:40.989
For her arrest in connection
with the death of her father,

26:41.030 --> 26:42.019
Vernon Rowley.

26:42.070 --> 26:43.207
Kate?

26:43.250 --> 26:45.241
I had nothing to do with it.

26:45.290 --> 26:46.427
I'm coming too.

26:46.470 --> 26:48.938
You stay here, get
the boy a paper bag.

26:48.990 --> 26:50.810
We'll leave tomorrow, okay?

26:50.870 --> 26:52.292
I don't even know you.

26:52.340 --> 26:55.468
It's his asthma,
he needs help!

26:55.520 --> 26:57.988
You being here is making
it worse. Come on.

26:58.050 --> 27:01.213
Wait. Stop! You can't do this!

27:01.270 --> 27:03.044
Mom! Call an ambulance!!

27:04.310 --> 27:06.039
Where were you the night
of February 13th?

27:06.100 --> 27:07.488
The night he died?

27:07.530 --> 27:10.658
I went to some "do" at a
friend's, then I went home.

27:10.710 --> 27:11.699
And before the party?

27:11.760 --> 27:13.057
I worked. Check my time-sheet.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.102
I hadn't seen her for months.

27:15.150 --> 27:18.108
I've a patrolman, identified
you in a fight with the man
the night he died.

27:18.150 --> 27:19.230
Must've been another girl.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.236
The last time she saw my father?

27:21.290 --> 27:23.099
The night he came to
the rooming house.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.024
They shook hands...

27:24.070 --> 27:25.765
And I wished them all the best.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.596
He'd scream every day
on that corner.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.891
He scream at you?

27:28.950 --> 27:30.599
I needed correction.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.720
Saw her scars?

27:31.780 --> 27:34.169
You feel Miss Rowley
was trapped?

27:34.210 --> 27:35.939
Kate's a grown woman!

27:36.000 --> 27:38.343
I could've left if I wanted to.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.254
And the letter?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.119
Betty- What letter?

27:40.180 --> 27:41.044
Kate- What letter?

27:44.440 --> 27:45.429
You loved her.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.222
She was your obsession.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.921
But Daddy stood in your way.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.790
You had a grudge.

27:52.840 --> 27:56.628
And here's a girl who you knew
would do your dirty-work.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.845
Women hold our moral centre.

28:01.890 --> 28:05.064
Only what's been asked
of you in this war,

28:05.110 --> 28:07.931
is stripping all
of that away.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.503
Betty- You can't prove a thing.

28:09.550 --> 28:11.279
Kate- You can't prove a thing.

28:11.340 --> 28:12.409
Watch me.

28:16.730 --> 28:19.733
So both of them? In jail?

28:19.780 --> 28:21.259
All night with the police.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.165
And capped it off
with a warrant.

28:23.220 --> 28:25.302
Just like that?

28:25.350 --> 28:26.783
I hate to trouble you,

28:26.830 --> 28:28.525
but there was nobody else I...

28:28.570 --> 28:29.787
It's no trouble.

28:29.830 --> 28:32.173
My daughter's in jail,
Mrs. Corbett.

28:32.230 --> 28:35.097
I can't lose her again.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.220
Please.

28:42.450 --> 28:45.669
Gladys- For the sake of
appearances, you go in first.

28:45.720 --> 28:50.498
Meet me in my office at
lunch. I've a proposition.

28:56.250 --> 29:00.334
Miss Witham. I need your help.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.812
This is the wrong way.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.167
Not today.

29:03.210 --> 29:05.553
Betty and Kate,
they're in terrible trouble.

29:05.610 --> 29:08.306
And I don't know how to fix it.

29:12.530 --> 29:15.522
Still can't believe I went
and fell asleep on you.

29:15.570 --> 29:16.650
What a lightweight.

29:16.710 --> 29:20.134
Beer has that effect
on the best of them.

29:20.190 --> 29:21.669
Once we load out tomorrow,

29:21.710 --> 29:23.439
that'll be it for
the blood drive.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.535
Till the next one.

29:24.580 --> 29:27.276
By then, I'll be over there.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.719
Yeah?

29:29.760 --> 29:34.629
Well, keep your head low,
and say hi to Twill for me.

29:35.550 --> 29:37.063
Incoming...

29:39.730 --> 29:40.719
[Whistle]

29:47.780 --> 29:48.735
Woops,

29:48.780 --> 29:50.338
left a little axel grease.

29:50.390 --> 29:51.561
Keep it.

29:51.610 --> 29:54.261
It'll earn you some
respect from the boys.

29:56.660 --> 29:59.003
I'll never forget you,
Vera Burr.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.839
Elizabeth McRae
and Marion Rowley

30:02.880 --> 30:06.884
are charged with murder
in the second degree.

30:06.930 --> 30:12.106
Accused of violently ending
the life of Vernon Rowley.

30:12.150 --> 30:15.062
Given that Miss Rowley
has been living under a
false identity,

30:15.110 --> 30:16.930
can we assume there's
a high risk of flight?

30:16.980 --> 30:18.629
Yes.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.988
What does the Crown recommend?

30:20.030 --> 30:22.498
That bail be denied,
Your Worship.

30:22.550 --> 30:24.245
We didn't kill anybody, honest.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.768
This is a bail hearing,
not a trial.

30:26.820 --> 30:28.424
With grave charges.

30:31.130 --> 30:35.169
Bail is set in the
amount of $7,000 each.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.529
Until such time as
bail can be met,

30:37.570 --> 30:39.652
the defendants will be
remanded into custody.

30:43.970 --> 30:45.870
Gladys- Your Honour?

30:45.930 --> 30:47.488
"Your Worship."

30:47.540 --> 30:48.928
Yes.

30:48.970 --> 30:54.272
Well, I will offer a surety.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.661
Gladys?

30:55.720 --> 30:58.234
You are in possession of
fourteen thousand dollars?

30:58.290 --> 30:59.587
Yes, sir.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.028
My name is Gladys Witham.

31:01.070 --> 31:02.549
And your father?

31:02.590 --> 31:05.241
Does he know you're involved
in this sordid business?

31:05.290 --> 31:07.338
It's not my father's money.

31:07.380 --> 31:09.200
As a surety,

31:11.730 --> 31:13.903
report to bail officers,
and attend all hearings.

31:13.950 --> 31:17.124
If not, you lose every dime.

31:17.170 --> 31:18.603
I understand.

31:18.650 --> 31:19.730
So ask yourself,

31:19.790 --> 31:22.304
how much do you trust
in these girls?

31:30.540 --> 31:33.008
Your Worship, I believe
in these women.

31:36.410 --> 31:39.709
Bail is granted. Miss Witham,
settle with the court office.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.719
And you, young women, do
not fail your friend.

31:52.040 --> 31:52.904
Gladys.

31:52.950 --> 31:55.032
I've got to go to the office.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.206
Gladys, thank you.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.991
I'm so sorry I did this.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.998
I said my first prayer in
I don't know how long,

32:03.050 --> 32:05.177
thanking God for you here.

32:05.220 --> 32:08.303
You had your secrets.
I understand.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.356
Go see your mom.

32:13.400 --> 32:17.097
Lorna- I should have just
destroyed the letter when
I had the chance.

32:17.150 --> 32:18.048
Betty- It's okay.

32:18.110 --> 32:19.759
I could have done
better by you.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.620
Look, I'm sorry. Both of you.

32:21.670 --> 32:23.581
This won't be
an easy fight.

32:23.630 --> 32:25.063
We'll work up a defence.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.192
It doesn't work,

32:27.240 --> 32:29.674
fixing each other's lives.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.630
Some things just
have to play out.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.022
Betty, this is not over.

32:33.080 --> 32:36.811
Princess? I can't owe you more.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.902
This just in.

32:54.270 --> 32:59.355
"I'm advancing without cover.
Jewel Box, 8pm."

33:12.860 --> 33:15.112
A coral dress.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.548
Quincy...

33:16.600 --> 33:19.421
Dividends from the
blood-drive?

33:19.470 --> 33:22.519
I saw that solider
chatting you up.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.511
You know, Carol?

33:26.560 --> 33:28.733
They say the tide is turning,

33:28.780 --> 33:34.616
that the battles we're fighting
might finally end different.

33:34.660 --> 33:37.174
You ask me.

33:37.230 --> 33:38.709
Isn't it time,

33:38.750 --> 33:41.093
we change things here, too?

33:45.370 --> 33:48.055
Is he nice, your soldier?

33:48.930 --> 33:50.067
Yes.

33:50.110 --> 33:51.714
He's very nice.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.325
But I can't do this anymore.

34:00.950 --> 34:04.329
I tell you, these asthma
cigarettes never seem to help.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.289
Excuse me, excuse me.

34:11.130 --> 34:13.655
They let you out.

34:13.700 --> 34:18.308
Gladys put up bail, but
we can't leave the city, yet.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.134
I'm so sorry Ivan.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.920
We're not going anywhere, Kate.

34:25.970 --> 34:27.278
The wedding's off.

34:32.330 --> 34:34.457
You don't mean that.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.414
I changed my life for you.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.599
And when you had the
chance to come clean,

34:42.640 --> 34:44.244
you only lied more.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.463
I don't even know
what to call you!

34:46.510 --> 34:49.331
Kate!

34:49.390 --> 34:50.994
You call me Kate.

34:54.090 --> 34:58.049
I gave you my heart.

34:58.090 --> 35:00.479
[Coughing]

35:00.530 --> 35:01.428
Nurse?

35:01.490 --> 35:02.741
Just go.

35:02.790 --> 35:03.745
Nurse!

35:03.790 --> 35:06.133
Kate, just go and
I'll be better.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.723
Waiting for someone?

35:29.950 --> 35:30.985
Yeah.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.161
Nice dress?

35:35.220 --> 35:38.690
Vera- Well he's a nice soldier.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.605
So, why's it in the box?

35:40.660 --> 35:43.003
If you must know,
I'm not taking it.

35:43.050 --> 35:44.392
Why is that?

35:44.440 --> 35:45.657
It's your favourite colour.

35:45.700 --> 35:48.578
How would you know
what colour it is?

35:55.450 --> 35:59.750
You're the one
who bought this dress?

35:59.800 --> 36:02.883
I know a thing or
two about you, Vera.

36:02.940 --> 36:05.329
But all I've been able
to see lately is

36:05.380 --> 36:07.940
the mess I've let this
war make of my life.

36:07.990 --> 36:11.460
I've been either too blind
or too stupid to tell,

36:11.510 --> 36:13.728
that all this time, Vera,

36:13.780 --> 36:17.295
I'm looking at the
best thing that ever
happened to me.

36:20.960 --> 36:26.398
I've got this... thick
porterhouse steak for two on
order.

36:31.270 --> 36:32.225
Hey.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.311
You're not out of
the doghouse yet.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.793
I know.

36:42.370 --> 36:44.452
Ivan won't see me.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.320
He says I'm no good.

36:48.770 --> 36:50.726
He'll come 'round.

36:50.770 --> 36:52.544
Why should he?

36:52.600 --> 36:54.500
He's right, I'm a liar.

36:56.210 --> 36:59.464
We didn't kill your dad.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.033
It was an accident.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.253
They're after us hard, Betty.

37:03.300 --> 37:07.953
And there's no way to play this
where we come out looking good.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.481
I should've never
asked you to stay.

37:11.530 --> 37:15.569
You wanted to leave when he
died and I wouldn't let you.

37:17.140 --> 37:21.099
Betty- I'm sorry.

37:21.150 --> 37:24.529
Growing up in that
awful caravan,

37:27.810 --> 37:34.022
But in the last year, I've lived
more than I ever dreamt.

37:35.810 --> 37:39.291
I found a real home.

37:39.340 --> 37:43.071
And I met a man who
was good to me.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.690
And I found a friend, Betty.

37:45.740 --> 37:47.128
A real friend.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.264
Who loved me.

38:01.970 --> 38:07.579
[Radio - Allied tanks, planes,
and infantry continue to
dispense sledge-hammer blows]

38:07.630 --> 38:11.236
[Radio- to the depleted
German and Italian divisions]

38:11.280 --> 38:13.805
[Radio- forcing them back toward the Libian border.]

38:13.850 --> 38:15.636
That's a tide turning,
right there.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.899
Feels like it's the first time
that's happened this war.

38:18.940 --> 38:20.419
That's because it is.

38:20.470 --> 38:22.938
Mom, what's that smell?

38:22.990 --> 38:24.241
[Knock at the door]

38:24.300 --> 38:26.939
It's lentils.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.639
Bob- Lentils? What kind
of dinner is lentils?

38:30.910 --> 38:31.820
Welcome.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.433
Sheila- Narendra?

38:34.480 --> 38:35.435
Bob- Well.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.131
I invited him for supper.

38:38.180 --> 38:39.044
You did?

38:39.090 --> 38:40.489
Thank you for having me.

38:40.530 --> 38:41.485
You're welcome.

38:46.710 --> 38:48.883
Some things have to play out.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.363
Well, come in, Doctor.
Take a seat.

39:03.860 --> 39:06.021
How go your exercises,
Mr. Corbett?

39:09.470 --> 39:10.778
Ingrid- Good morning.

39:13.430 --> 39:15.603
Honey. You should
eat something.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.435
I'm done running, Mom.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.520
I'm going to tell the truth.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.050
What's this?

39:33.100 --> 39:34.977
Something that Betty left you.

39:38.370 --> 39:40.156
"You're safe here now."

39:44.120 --> 39:46.463
Marion what happened?

39:46.510 --> 39:47.898
I've gotta stop her.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.902
You're up early.

39:55.950 --> 39:57.292
What are you doing?

39:58.700 --> 40:02.864
Figuring out how to convince
my father I'm no fool.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.741
He'll think I just threw
away my trust fund.

40:05.790 --> 40:07.178
I can hear him now:

40:07.230 --> 40:09.391
"You hardly know these girls."

40:09.450 --> 40:11.441
Father doesn't see
what I see.

40:11.490 --> 40:16.621
The courage, shrewdness,
creative thinking.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.240
They don't look good
on a Rosedale Girl.

40:32.210 --> 40:34.075
Then get out of Rosedale.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.906
Easy for you to say,

40:35.950 --> 40:37.258
you're leaving.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.420
There's a place we
call "the farm,"

40:40.480 --> 40:42.380
a good drive out of town.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.647
Allied operatives from around
the world train there,

40:44.700 --> 40:47.339
and carry out missions.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.561
No volunteers.
Only recrUIts.

40:49.620 --> 40:51.702
Sounds like a dime-store novel.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.263
We'll help win this war.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.709
New codes, new technologies.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.889
RDX is only the beginning.

40:57.930 --> 41:01.104
You're telling me this now, why?

41:01.150 --> 41:04.404
Because I want you in.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.418
Of course, you'd be subject
to the Official Secrets Act.

41:07.460 --> 41:10.418
Family, friends,

41:10.460 --> 41:12.849
they can never know.

41:12.900 --> 41:15.812
You have what it takes, Gladys.

41:15.860 --> 41:18.328
Are you up for the job?

41:19.780 --> 41:20.599
Betty?

41:21.910 --> 41:22.683
Betty?

41:25.130 --> 41:28.384
Betty! Betty!

41:28.440 --> 41:29.691
You were saying.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.615
I went to see the preacher,

41:34.660 --> 41:37.709
to tell him to stop
harassing me at work.

41:37.750 --> 41:39.399
He got mad.

41:39.840 --> 41:40.659
Go on.

41:43.020 --> 41:47.320
He attacked me,
had me on the run.

41:47.370 --> 41:55.152
I went into this alleyway,
up a fire-escape.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.543
He was right behind me,

41:57.600 --> 42:01.070
grabbing me, hitting me.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.553
And then what?

42:04.780 --> 42:06.475
He fell.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.420
And your friend Marion?

42:08.480 --> 42:11.517
My friend Marion was not there.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.253
I'll swear to it.

42:29.760 --> 42:32.809
Lorna- They say with El
Alamein, the tide is turning.

42:36.510 --> 42:40.765
Girls, they're luclq
they have you here.

42:40.810 --> 42:43.938
Otherwise, who knows what
might happen to them?

42:46.730 --> 42:48.869
You have something for me?

43:00.620 --> 43:03.305
The turning tide.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.225
How did Churchill put it?

43:05.270 --> 43:06.794
"Now this,

43:06.840 --> 43:08.614
is not the end."

43:08.670 --> 43:11.889
"It is_ not even the
beginning of the end."

43:14.980 --> 43:17.756
Gladys- "But it is, perhaps..."

43:20.110 --> 43:22.761
"...the end of the beginning."
