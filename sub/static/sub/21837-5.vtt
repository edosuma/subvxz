00:03.335 --> 00:06.007
- I'd like us to stay friends.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

00:06.594 --> 00:08.960
No, Tom. No more lying.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.400
We're a mistake, Tom. It's over.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.784
Are you saying he drugged you?

00:12.810 --> 00:15.077
That's why the whole night
has felt like a blur.

00:16.244 --> 00:17.699
Cheers.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.974
You don't want to come in
for a drink, do you?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.231
I don't drink with men who rape women.

00:22.319 --> 00:24.784
The man who raped us is
walking around free.

00:24.810 --> 00:27.610
He's done this God knows how
many times and got away with it.

00:27.636 --> 00:28.886
I'm so sorry.

00:29.361 --> 00:32.720
When Natalie was pregnant, she
was sick the entire nine months.

00:32.747 --> 00:34.053
The whole nine months?

00:34.079 --> 00:36.320
I know why your wife killed herself.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.043
She couldn't bear to live
with someone like you any longer.

00:40.069 --> 00:41.858
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah, I brought it.

00:54.338 --> 00:55.856
Are you sure about this?

00:56.063 --> 00:57.576
I wouldn't have asked you if I wasn't.

00:57.610 --> 00:59.315
Are you going to tell me what
you're planning to do with it?

00:59.341 --> 01:01.235
Maybe it's best if you don't know.

01:01.592 --> 01:05.272
I just bought GHB. I'm already involved.

01:06.060 --> 01:07.940
You know he's back at work...

01:07.980 --> 01:09.304
Andrew?

01:10.740 --> 01:14.193
Every day, he gets to drop
his son off at school,

01:14.620 --> 01:16.778
drive that stupid car of his to work.

01:16.804 --> 01:19.327
Everyone thinks he's some kind of hero.

01:20.460 --> 01:23.171
He shouldn't get to carry on
like nothing happened.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.940
His house has already
been searched, but...

01:30.100 --> 01:32.850
..if I can get the police
to look in his locker at work...

01:34.300 --> 01:37.980
How will you plant it in his locker?
You can't just walk in.

01:38.020 --> 01:39.671
I'll use my sister's key card.

01:40.548 --> 01:41.887
Once you're in?

01:42.030 --> 01:44.744
Katy's always saying how
useless those locker doors are.

01:46.564 --> 01:50.700
Say you do all that. What's to stop
his lawyer saying it was planted?

01:50.740 --> 01:52.517
Don't try and talk me out of it, Tom.

01:54.435 --> 01:56.260
I was actually going to
offer to help you.

01:56.589 --> 01:57.780
No.

01:58.343 --> 01:59.980
This isn't your problem.

02:00.534 --> 02:03.580
Andrew complained about
the search on his house.

02:04.439 --> 02:06.554
I got suspended yesterday.

02:07.505 --> 02:08.729
What?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.500
Oh, God.

02:12.540 --> 02:13.908
I'm so sorry.

02:15.818 --> 02:19.293
It's not going to be easy to just
walk into the male changing room.

02:20.161 --> 02:21.620
I'll work it out.

02:22.355 --> 02:24.142
Get the card and meet me
outside the hospital.

02:24.168 --> 02:27.227
- I've already got you into trouble.
- So I've got nothing to lose.

02:30.911 --> 02:33.511
- Are you sure?
- Just name your time.

02:34.811 --> 02:37.964
Give me a couple of hours,
I'll meet you there.

02:40.477 --> 02:41.948
Thank you.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.466
Hey...

02:48.660 --> 02:50.351
..this is Katy's, isn't it?

02:50.820 --> 02:54.196
Unless you've got your own
umbrella with tiny dogs on it.

02:55.758 --> 03:00.433
I must have picked it up from yours by
mistake when I was getting my stuff.

03:01.844 --> 03:05.065
Well, no, she had this
just the other day.

03:06.066 --> 03:08.746
OK, I was worried about you,

03:09.900 --> 03:14.580
and when you disappeared,
Katy was worried about you too.

03:14.620 --> 03:18.210
She called me, I gave her a lift
back from the hospital.

03:19.820 --> 03:23.780
I didn't want you thinking we were
talking about you behind your back.

03:23.820 --> 03:25.911
- I should have just said.
- Yeah, you should.

03:26.130 --> 03:29.367
If you or Katy have something
to say to me, say it to my face.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.880
You're right. Sorry.

03:33.340 --> 03:34.940
Thanks for this.

Katy. Leave a message.</i>

03:59.047 --> 04:00.946
Hey, it's me.

04:01.527 --> 04:04.390
I know I'm probably the last person
you want to speak to right now,

04:04.734 --> 04:06.991
but you need to call me soon as.

04:11.884 --> 04:14.644
Miss Harmon? I'm Dr Kyle.

04:14.670 --> 04:16.950
Triage said you'd had some bleeding.

04:16.976 --> 04:19.616
Yeah, it started last night.

04:19.642 --> 04:23.565
Just a little bit, but I thought I'd
better come and get it checked out.

04:24.124 --> 04:27.307
Let's take a look at your baby,
set your mind at ease.

04:29.260 --> 04:32.740
At this stage, we use an internal
probe to see the heartbeat.

04:32.780 --> 04:34.083
Is that OK?

04:34.420 --> 04:38.020
Yeah. Erm, I'm also in
quite a lot of pain.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.089
I mean, it's painful.

04:40.115 --> 04:41.367
Where?

04:42.380 --> 04:45.276
- Here.
- Could be an infection.

04:46.239 --> 04:48.239
- OK.
- I'll take a look.

04:55.340 --> 04:59.340
Right. Looks like some sort of abrasion.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.323
What?

05:01.182 --> 05:02.847
Several, actually.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.428
That would explain the
bleeding and the pain.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.190
Wait, I don't...

05:09.740 --> 05:11.780
Sorry, I don't understand.

05:11.929 --> 05:13.775
Let's take a look at your baby.

05:16.957 --> 05:18.661
This might be a little bit cold.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.958
Here we go.

05:22.540 --> 05:23.784
There we are.

05:25.180 --> 05:26.628
There's the heartbeat there.

05:26.940 --> 05:27.835
Oh!

05:32.780 --> 05:35.487
I'll get them to print
you out a picture.

05:39.706 --> 05:42.954
Thank you. Thank you very much.

05:43.378 --> 05:46.075
Can you think what could
cause these cuts?

05:47.660 --> 05:50.778
Is there a chance it could be old
scar tissue that's been aggravated?

05:50.804 --> 05:54.079
No, no. I've never had
anything like that.

05:54.303 --> 05:57.490
OK. It's nothing that won't heal.

05:58.260 --> 06:01.466
When this kind of damage
happens during intercourse,

06:01.785 --> 06:04.336
it's usually completely unintentional.

06:05.580 --> 06:08.657
It's something you might want
to discuss with your partner.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.200
Miss Harmon?

06:23.040 --> 06:25.160
I want you to test me for GHB.

06:26.860 --> 06:31.580
- No!
- I'm going to tickle, tickle, tickle!

06:40.340 --> 06:41.717
Oh!

06:46.780 --> 06:48.530
- Hey!
- Hi!

06:48.556 --> 06:50.156
Come in.

06:51.107 --> 06:52.820
Sorry, I just...

06:52.860 --> 06:56.580
Being on my own at my place at the
weekend... Just wanted some company.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.246
That's fine. You all right?

06:59.466 --> 07:01.154
Do you mind if I make a coffee?

07:01.180 --> 07:03.437
Go ahead, as long as
you make me one too.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.840
Right, rascals.

07:24.020 --> 07:27.795
They've sent me away. Apparently,
I'm not needed any more.

07:28.885 --> 07:32.193
Oh, erm, I brought this back for you.

07:34.340 --> 07:37.117
Oh, amazing! I was
wondering where that went.

07:37.978 --> 07:39.439
Tom's car.

07:41.168 --> 07:42.448
Right.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.245
Right. Erm...

07:46.788 --> 07:49.245
He came round looking
for you after you...

07:49.271 --> 07:51.321
When you were still here, and...

07:52.120 --> 07:55.252
Yeah. It was raining,
so I lent him my umbrella.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.820
- You lent it to him?
- Yeah.

08:00.924 --> 08:03.133
Why were you wondering where
it was if you lent it to him?

08:03.159 --> 08:04.514
You'd remember that, wouldn't you?

08:04.909 --> 08:07.436
You know what it's like,
with kids running around.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.700
I feel like I've been slowly lobotomised

08:10.740 --> 08:12.132
ever since they were born.

08:12.441 --> 08:14.242
I really need that coffee.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.380
- That's not how Tom remembers it.
- Really?

08:18.420 --> 08:20.220
- Yeah.
- That's weird.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.040
Why are you lying to me, Katy?

08:26.960 --> 08:28.960
What's got into you?

08:31.611 --> 08:34.380
When I asked Tom how your
umbrella ended up in his car,

08:34.419 --> 08:36.455
he had the same look on his face
that you do now.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.140
I don't know why you're
obsessing about this.

08:40.179 --> 08:44.635
Don't you dare! Don't you dare make
me feel like I'm the one losing it.

08:44.974 --> 08:48.354
Don't you dare stand there and lie
to me, Katy! You tell me the truth.

08:55.295 --> 08:56.521
I can't.

09:00.021 --> 09:01.521
What have you done?

09:04.600 --> 09:06.500
What have you done, Katy?

09:09.660 --> 09:11.980
It's over, so it doesn't
matter, does it?

09:14.660 --> 09:16.160
It's over.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.300
You and Tom?

09:30.389 --> 09:33.590
We were just... so tired...

09:35.660 --> 09:39.763
..me and Liam, all the time,
and I was always working, and...

09:42.580 --> 09:45.740
I... You lose your way, you know?

09:45.780 --> 09:50.899
And you make decisions that, at the
time, seem the right thing, but...

09:55.861 --> 09:58.796
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm sorry.

09:58.822 --> 10:01.860
I'm so fucking stupid!

10:01.900 --> 10:03.660
Please, don't say that.

10:03.686 --> 10:09.500
You're the one person, Katy,
the one person I trusted.

10:09.578 --> 10:14.020
It is over, it is over. Just talk
to me, say anything, I deserve it.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.900
Get off me, Katy!

10:15.940 --> 10:17.270
What happened?

10:17.460 --> 10:19.580
Why don't you ask your wife?

10:21.772 --> 10:23.152
Katy?

10:25.300 --> 10:26.800
Katy, what's going on?

10:30.140 --> 10:31.520
Liam...

10:34.720 --> 10:37.100
..sit down for a minute, will you?

11:21.240 --> 11:24.360
- Hello?
- Hi there. Is this Vanessa Harmon?

11:24.400 --> 11:27.120
- Speaking.
- <i>Hi, it's Dr Rachel Kyle.</i>

11:27.160 --> 11:29.415
<i>You had a consultation with me
this morning.</i>

11:29.441 --> 11:31.605
<i>Could I get a date of birth to confirm?</i>

11:31.631 --> 11:34.344
Yeah, it's 21st September 1976.

11:34.370 --> 11:38.610
Great. I just wanted to
pass on your test results.

11:38.636 --> 11:40.636
<i>They're clear of GHB.</i>

11:42.400 --> 11:47.224
- Are you sure?
- I am, but GHB leaves the system fast.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.440
Miss Harmon, is there something
you're concerned about?

11:51.480 --> 11:54.160
- <i>I can arrange a time to talk.</i>
- No, it's fine.

11:54.186 --> 11:57.068
<i>The cuts I observed in your exam
are far from usual.</i>

11:57.400 --> 12:00.265
- <i>We can arrange an appointment.</i>
- I said, it's fine.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.795
Thank you.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.768
<i>Hey, I'm outside the hospital.
I'm ready if you've got the card.</i>

12:33.520 --> 12:35.400
I know about you and Katy.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.480
- What do you mean?
- Spare me the excuses, Tom.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.839
<i>You know exactly what I mean.</i>

12:43.720 --> 12:46.880
The worst part is, I can't
even be bothered to be angry.

12:47.342 --> 12:49.179
I just haven't got the strength.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.990
How pathetic is that?

12:53.722 --> 12:55.720
Laura, I never...

12:55.760 --> 12:58.493
- We didn't...
- Yeah, well, shit happens, doesn't it?

12:59.945 --> 13:02.674
Life happens, now look at us.

13:03.888 --> 13:05.448
Where are you?

13:06.272 --> 13:07.520
You OK?

13:08.318 --> 13:09.754
Bye, Tom.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.760
We've arranged for her mates
to come and surprise her

13:34.800 --> 13:36.760
at her favourite restaurant.

13:36.800 --> 13:41.320
Nice idea, except her
favourite restaurant

13:41.360 --> 13:44.492
just happens to be the bloody Marlow!

13:45.289 --> 13:48.120
- You OK?
- Yeah, fine.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.760
I can keep talking about my
daughter's overpriced birthday party

13:51.800 --> 13:54.238
but I sense I am boring
the crap out of you.

13:54.312 --> 13:57.328
- Why are you looking at those?
- I'm giving evidence tomorrow.

13:57.354 --> 14:01.514
Right, of course.
Bloody awful, that one, Jones kid.

14:03.858 --> 14:07.128
So... it's just the case, is it?

14:08.028 --> 14:09.400
What do you mean?

14:09.440 --> 14:13.788
I feel you've been on a different
planet this morning. What is it?

14:14.840 --> 14:16.184
GHB.

14:16.902 --> 14:20.120
Have we ever had a positive
test result after 12 hours?

14:20.390 --> 14:23.798
Not that I can remember.
Always clears the system by then.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.370
Sickness - that's what
they say, isn't it?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.397
Anyone who's ever been given it,

14:29.589 --> 14:34.956
they wake up with this burning
sick feeling, like a dizziness.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.718
Are you going somewhere with this?

14:42.500 --> 14:45.520
- I'm just tired.
- No, you're not.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.860
Ness...

14:50.920 --> 14:56.000
..whatever it is, you can
tell me, you know that.

14:56.109 --> 15:00.386
Rory, honestly, I'm fine.
You're worse than my mum.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.857
<i>Hi, this is Liam.</i>

15:22.883 --> 15:25.685
<i>Leave your name and number,
I'll get back to you. Cheers.</i>

15:27.008 --> 15:28.464
Liam?

15:29.438 --> 15:31.438
Erm, where are you?

15:34.000 --> 15:37.160
Call me, text, anything.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.828
At least let me know where
you are, that you're OK.

15:58.211 --> 16:01.070
<i>Hi, this is Laura.
Please leave a message.</i>

16:36.937 --> 16:38.600
That's not fair.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.280
- Shit!
- You all right?

16:42.320 --> 16:46.248
- Do you need a hand? All right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine!

16:53.080 --> 16:54.315
Fine.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.720
Hello!

17:59.760 --> 18:01.436
We're in here!

18:03.720 --> 18:05.800
Oh, yes?

18:06.206 --> 18:09.559
What's going on in here,
some illegal gambling, is it?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.000
Silly!

18:12.040 --> 18:14.680
Watch yourself, Mia,
she's a cut-throat cheat.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.943
- She'll stop at nothing for victory.
- Yes, I know!

18:18.274 --> 18:21.320
- How's she been?
- She had a fall yesterday

18:21.360 --> 18:24.280
and grazed her knee, but nothing so bad.

18:24.518 --> 18:26.776
She must be more careful
when I'm not here.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.120
She can hear you, you know!

18:29.470 --> 18:31.800
I can't get anything past you, can I?

18:31.840 --> 18:36.095
Not with these ears! They work
as well as they ever have, they do.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.278
Would you like to join us?

18:38.304 --> 18:41.409
No way! You'll have
the shirt off my back.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.880
Listen, do you mind if I store this
other bag with the rest of my stuff?

18:45.920 --> 18:48.806
- Of course not, dear!
- Thank you. I won't be a tick.

19:29.061 --> 19:32.080
I'd like to start by talking
about why you're here today,

19:32.120 --> 19:35.320
- if you don't mind.
- Where do I start?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.211
Start with how you feel.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.431
Erm...

19:42.840 --> 19:44.565
I feel...

19:46.240 --> 19:49.599
..confused, powerless.

19:51.317 --> 19:52.760
I feel...

19:56.080 --> 19:58.981
..dirty somehow, all of the time.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.637
It probably seems impossible now
but that can be changed.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.045
Do you know what I am? I'm...

20:09.200 --> 20:11.753
I'm angry. I'm angry at him...

20:13.520 --> 20:19.014
..for everything he did to me
that night and every day after.

20:19.494 --> 20:21.894
I want him to feel humiliated.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.017
I want him to suffer.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.600
- That's normal, Laura.
- Yeah, I'm sure it is,

20:28.640 --> 20:30.945
but it's also a waste of time, isn't it,

20:32.022 --> 20:35.119
because there's absolutely nothing
I can do about it.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.812
I've tried though. I've
screamed blue murder

20:39.838 --> 20:41.203
but the world isn't listening.

20:41.312 --> 20:46.150
And now I'm sat here, talking to you,

20:46.640 --> 20:50.040
and he is walking around,

20:50.080 --> 20:53.844
free to just do it all over again
to some other poor woman.

20:54.227 --> 20:59.667
Being angry is normal, but
anger only takes you so far.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.439
What does that even mean?

21:01.465 --> 21:05.209
The time you spend being angry
at him, thinking about him,

21:05.480 --> 21:08.230
that is time you are robbing
yourself of a chance to focus...

21:08.256 --> 21:11.076
I don't care about me, right?
I don't care.

21:11.259 --> 21:16.179
All I care about is
him answering for what he's done.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.884
It's not right.

21:18.526 --> 21:21.758
It's not right, is it, that he
just gets to walk away now?

21:22.306 --> 21:26.306
Explain to me... Explain
to me how that is right.

21:26.332 --> 21:28.082
That's not what I'm saying.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.921
I'm sorry, I...

21:32.800 --> 21:36.200
- I think I've wasted your time.
- Laura, wait.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.920
Andrew?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.870
Yeah, just a minute! Hang on.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.440
- I'm sorry, I did not mean to disturb you.
- Not at all.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.517
I was just trying to find some
of Luke's old school reports.

22:32.543 --> 22:35.633
I wondered if you would like tea,
coffee maybe?

22:35.659 --> 22:38.673
That sounds like a lovely idea.
Let me help you.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.600
So how did she fall,
what happened there?

22:42.640 --> 22:44.640
Well, I wasn't here...

22:50.800 --> 22:52.960
- Detective.
- Hi, Mrs Jones.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.644
Thanks for your testimony.

22:54.891 --> 22:56.491
All in a day's work.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.604
- Do you think it will be enough?
- What do you mean?

22:59.750 --> 23:02.988
Anthony doesn't want
to go on the stand any more.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.249
Erm, give me a minute
with him, will you?

23:09.080 --> 23:12.680
<i>Court is now adjourned
and will resume in 30 minutes.</i>

23:12.720 --> 23:14.672
Hey there, Anthony. How are you doing?

23:14.756 --> 23:15.763
All right.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.738
Your mum says you're having
second thoughts about testifying.

23:20.405 --> 23:21.694
Yeah?

23:24.760 --> 23:26.910
Do you remember the night it happened?

23:27.360 --> 23:30.047
I came to see you in the hospital
after the operation.

23:30.362 --> 23:31.587
Yeah.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.072
You said you couldn't remember
what happened.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.753
I told you, you had nothing
to be ashamed about.

23:43.292 --> 23:45.582
I said you were going
to have to be brave...

23:47.760 --> 23:49.091
..because...

23:50.600 --> 23:52.875
..because if you kept
it to yourself, you...

23:54.936 --> 23:56.897
Sorry. Erm...

24:00.869 --> 24:02.840
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, sorry.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.130
Yeah, I just need to make a quick call.

24:18.360 --> 24:19.624
Rory?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.642
I need to talk to you.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.981
Yeah, but in person.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.585
If you don't mind.

24:29.465 --> 24:31.350
No.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.561
No, not really.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.845
How long will you stay at your mum's?

24:38.124 --> 24:40.291
Long enough for you to find
somewhere else to go.

24:42.639 --> 24:45.359
That's the last of it, I shouldn't
need to be back for a while.

24:45.561 --> 24:49.080
- Please don't!
- We've been through this already.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.680
We've said all we need to say.

24:51.226 --> 24:55.106
- It didn't mean anything!
- You keep saying that!

24:55.132 --> 24:56.812
But it did, didn't it?

24:57.301 --> 24:59.480
The things that we do,
they mean everything.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.459
You're not stupid, you understand that.

25:02.276 --> 25:03.269
Liam...

25:03.295 --> 25:05.729
No, I'm done, OK? I'm not
talking about it any more.

25:06.131 --> 25:09.022
Christ. Do you know what?
You had a choice

25:09.048 --> 25:10.760
and you chose to risk everything.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.440
That choice has consequences.
It's called being a grown-up.

25:15.053 --> 25:18.265
And do you know what?
It's boring as shit,

25:18.420 --> 25:20.134
but it's also life.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.080
What will you tell the kids?

25:29.033 --> 25:31.667
I'm going to tell them that
we need time apart.

25:32.251 --> 25:34.967
- You can't do that.
- I'm telling them the truth.

25:35.509 --> 25:38.756
Lying doesn't come as easily to me
as it does to you, Katy.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.289
Liam!

25:49.220 --> 25:51.700
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

27:24.800 --> 27:27.320
Shit!

27:30.540 --> 27:31.860
Found you.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.864
You said you wanted to talk
about the defamation suit.

27:44.041 --> 27:46.304
Yeah, right.

27:46.758 --> 27:48.541
Sounds like fun.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.861
I shouldn't have come.

27:56.309 --> 27:57.967
Where are you going?

27:58.480 --> 28:00.160
- You're drunk.
- I'm fine!

28:00.200 --> 28:03.111
- You're drunk and you're embarrassing.
- Shut up!

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Go home, eh?

28:10.080 --> 28:12.374
You can call your lawyer off, OK?

28:13.003 --> 28:15.635
I'm walking away. Congratulations.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.563
You got just what you wanted.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.833
You think I wanted this,

28:21.698 --> 28:25.793
you dragging my name, my family,
through the mud,

28:26.504 --> 28:29.012
having to go to work and
have people look at me,

28:29.038 --> 28:31.238
wondering if I'm some kind of pervert?

28:31.264 --> 28:33.152
You think that's what I wanted?

28:37.600 --> 28:39.450
You know, I used to feel sorry for you,

28:39.476 --> 28:41.676
I really did, but no more now, Laura.

28:41.957 --> 28:44.678
If you say you're done,
you'd better mean it.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.483
Screw you!

28:57.998 --> 29:00.617
Oh, shit, shit!

29:00.840 --> 29:02.282
Shit!

29:04.680 --> 29:05.846
Shit!

29:11.200 --> 29:14.760
- You shouldn't drive.
- What do you care?

29:19.018 --> 29:20.310
Hey!

29:22.400 --> 29:25.190
- What are you doing?
- You said I was too drunk to drive.

29:25.641 --> 29:28.497
- So?
- So you can give me a lift.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.920
After everything you said I did to you?

29:32.960 --> 29:35.965
Yeah, well, you never really
know a person, do you?

29:35.991 --> 29:38.168
Me, I thought I knew my sister.

29:38.640 --> 29:42.022
I thought I knew you just from saying
hello outside the school gates,

29:42.048 --> 29:43.482
like that would tell me anything.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.160
You can know somebody 30 years
and they can still surprise you.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.771
I'm not scared of you, Andrew.

29:49.148 --> 29:52.513
You're scared of me though, aren't you?
Scared of all women.

29:52.539 --> 29:54.180
What happened to you?

29:55.079 --> 29:58.319
Was it your mother? Usually is.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.321
Look, just go home, will you?

30:03.720 --> 30:05.318
Or what?

30:06.840 --> 30:08.400
Ahh!

30:08.440 --> 30:11.396
You scratched me!
What did you do that for?

30:14.960 --> 30:16.440
Do you feel OK?

30:16.480 --> 30:19.120
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. I just...

30:19.160 --> 30:21.520
I'm just a bit tired, OK? That's all.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.657
- Yeah.
- Will you please just go home?

30:23.796 --> 30:25.800
- I'm just...
- Why don't you sit down?

30:25.840 --> 30:27.180
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

30:27.206 --> 30:29.979
- Just have a seat, you'll feel better.
- What's going on?

30:32.080 --> 30:34.046
- What are you doing?
- Careful.

30:34.072 --> 30:36.240
This stuff's supposed to be strong.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.917
Don't fight it, just relax.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.880
I know it was him.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.533
- We have to get him.
- I'll file the report

32:02.736 --> 32:05.632
and we'll lock away that
little shit for good.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.116
But not tonight.

32:10.397 --> 32:14.199
We should research this first,
get it right this time.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.608
So we need phone records.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.295
A sports car like his is going to be
fitted with a security tracker.

32:22.972 --> 32:24.371
We can look at that.

32:25.273 --> 32:29.433
We need to find something that proves
he was here in my house.

32:29.459 --> 32:31.746
I'll make the request,
we'll push it through ASAP.

32:31.772 --> 32:32.739
Thank you.

32:34.246 --> 32:36.600
- Get it.
- No. No, it's fine.

32:36.640 --> 32:41.195
You need me to take the lead on
this, Nessie. You shouldn't have to.

32:43.363 --> 32:46.443
Oh, my God, it's your
daughter's birthday!

32:46.469 --> 32:49.669
I thought you weren't listening!
Honestly, she'll understand.

32:49.695 --> 32:53.071
She shouldn't have to. Go.
Go on, I mean it, go.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.829
Well...

33:02.114 --> 33:03.802
We're going to put him away, Ness.

33:06.078 --> 33:08.626
You call me.

33:09.063 --> 33:10.534
- Promise?
- Yeah.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.116
Thank you.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.400
Thank you.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.506
You drugged me!

34:10.712 --> 34:12.245
I feel sick.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.983
And?

34:16.072 --> 34:18.281
What the hell do you think you're doing?

34:18.306 --> 34:20.367
You mean, you don't like it?

34:21.120 --> 34:23.120
Poor you.

34:24.987 --> 34:26.518
Laura...

34:27.351 --> 34:28.726
Why don't you like it?

34:28.752 --> 34:31.032
Is it because you like to
be the one in control?

34:31.652 --> 34:34.018
That's why you do what you do, isn't it?

34:34.320 --> 34:36.496
You like to feel like you're in charge.

34:36.681 --> 34:38.406
Is that why you chose me?

34:39.562 --> 34:42.562
You thought I needed
a lesson, is that it?

34:45.360 --> 34:47.507
You'll feel like crap for a few hours.

34:48.706 --> 34:51.121
That's what the poison you gave me does.

34:52.407 --> 34:54.149
You can't be serious.

34:56.484 --> 34:57.700
Why not?

34:57.726 --> 35:02.000
Why can't I do whatever
I want, just like you?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.047
OK, OK.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.471
OK, Laura.

35:09.997 --> 35:11.319
OK.

35:12.095 --> 35:14.311
What is it you're going to do to me?

35:26.580 --> 35:29.322
<i>Hi, this is Rory.
Can't come to the phone right now.</i>

35:29.348 --> 35:31.103
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

35:31.674 --> 35:33.879
Hi, it's just me.

35:34.390 --> 35:37.658
Nothing to be alarmed about,
I'm just checking in.

35:38.897 --> 35:42.290
He wasn't outside my house that night,

35:42.610 --> 35:44.841
but I'm looking at the
tracker details now,

35:44.867 --> 35:49.547
and he's parked in the middle
of nowhere, right by the marshes.

35:49.573 --> 35:51.730
He's been there for a while, and just...

35:53.780 --> 35:56.096
I just probably need to get some sleep.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.339
OK, I hope you're having fun.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.490
Now what?

36:16.281 --> 36:18.326
When did you break into my house?

36:18.672 --> 36:20.852
You really have lost it, haven't you?

36:21.835 --> 36:23.654
Why can't you admit it?

36:24.327 --> 36:27.425
Are you that far gone that you
actually believe your own shit?

36:27.860 --> 36:30.554
At the end of the day, I didn't know
what to do with myself.

36:30.580 --> 36:34.908
I didn't know who to talk to,
so I ended up Googling,

36:35.020 --> 36:37.431
"What do rapists deserve?"

36:38.628 --> 36:41.148
Funny, isn't it, the things we do

36:41.174 --> 36:43.423
when we're on our own
and the door closes -

36:43.516 --> 36:46.262
turning to a search engine
for enlightenment.

36:46.980 --> 36:50.349
I suppose we're all certifiable,
aren't we, really?

36:50.820 --> 36:57.380
There were so many people,
so many women and girls, men,

36:57.406 --> 36:59.180
who had been through the same thing,

36:59.220 --> 37:01.820
and so many of them who weren't believed

37:01.860 --> 37:04.826
because, hey, unless you're
screaming, you're saying yes, right?

37:05.142 --> 37:09.182
And if you're too drunk to
fight back, that's your fault.

37:09.253 --> 37:11.009
Boys will be boys.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.459
What do rapists deserve, then?

37:15.070 --> 37:17.027
What did the Internet tell you?

37:19.700 --> 37:21.567
Well, most people thought...

37:22.900 --> 37:25.766
..that you should cut the
problem off at the source,

37:27.078 --> 37:28.625
remove the problem.

37:36.273 --> 37:39.113
- You wouldn't?
- I'm sure I would sleep better

37:39.216 --> 37:43.696
knowing that you couldn't be
a threat to anyone any more.

37:47.707 --> 37:50.140
Your face!

37:50.464 --> 37:52.704
You should see your face!

37:54.865 --> 37:56.385
Do you remember her?

37:56.411 --> 38:00.476
She can still barely bring herself
to talk about what you did to her.

38:00.901 --> 38:05.849
She can't bring herself to go to the
police and tell them what happened.

38:15.426 --> 38:18.139
What is it you think I
did, then, Laura, eh?

38:22.249 --> 38:24.862
I didn't kill my wife, if
that's what you're thinking.

38:27.940 --> 38:29.840
I watched her do it though.

38:32.920 --> 38:36.145
I was surprised the stupid cow
actually went through with it.

38:37.380 --> 38:40.198
I'd been telling her for months
it's what she should do.

38:40.540 --> 38:45.558
I got tired of her sad, stupid eyes
following me around the room,

38:46.020 --> 38:47.912
desperate for my approval.

38:48.995 --> 38:51.220
After a while, it's not enough, is it?

38:54.220 --> 38:56.820
I needed someone with a bit more spark.

38:58.465 --> 39:00.220
And Catherine, well...

39:01.152 --> 39:02.885
That's what a man needs, isn't it,

39:03.135 --> 39:05.307
something to chase, something to hunt.

39:05.964 --> 39:08.673
You should have seen her face
when I told her.

39:11.651 --> 39:14.094
You dared your wife to kill herself.

39:15.110 --> 39:16.820
Bravest thing she's ever done.

39:18.030 --> 39:19.849
It's not saying much, but...

39:22.546 --> 39:23.906
But you...

39:25.116 --> 39:28.060
You're different, aren't you, Laura?
You fight back.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.946
You're nipping at my heels
and buzzing in my ears

39:30.972 --> 39:32.477
and you just won't go away.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.104
No, I won't.

39:37.777 --> 39:40.820
But I've got you now, Andrew.

39:42.974 --> 39:44.380
What are you talking about?

39:44.420 --> 39:48.343
I thought... I thought it'd be easy,

39:49.070 --> 39:52.204
tell the truth, the police
come and lock you up.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.067
I honestly believed that.

39:55.868 --> 39:58.004
But I won't make the
same mistakes this time.

39:59.295 --> 40:00.462
This time?

40:01.325 --> 40:05.169
This time, I'll lie,
but they'll believe me.

40:06.013 --> 40:08.874
People saw us together in the bar,
I made sure of that.

40:09.300 --> 40:12.660
They saw that I was drunk.
They saw us leave together.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.820
Come the morning, I'll go to the police

40:14.860 --> 40:16.506
and tell them you brought me here.

40:16.532 --> 40:19.052
I'll show them the rope burns
round my wrist,

40:19.340 --> 40:21.024
rope with your DNA on it.

40:21.380 --> 40:24.460
Don't be ridiculous,
I've never even been here!

40:24.500 --> 40:27.540
I told you about it on our date, right?

40:27.952 --> 40:30.621
Well, that's what I'll say anyway.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.500
There's scratch marks on your neck
from where I fought you off,

40:34.540 --> 40:37.420
managed to restrain you,
tie you up with boat straps.

40:37.460 --> 40:40.060
When they search the glove
compartment of your car,

40:40.100 --> 40:41.288
they'll find a vial of GHB.

40:42.060 --> 40:46.006
So what do you think, do you think
they'll believe me this time?

40:46.790 --> 40:50.073
Do you think this time I can
tell a lie and get away with it?

41:05.820 --> 41:07.218
Don't run.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.012
Stop screaming!

43:09.540 --> 43:11.066
Come here!

43:15.180 --> 43:17.860
- Get off me!
- Shut up, shut up!

43:28.380 --> 43:30.077
Stop right there!

43:31.606 --> 43:35.500
Help me, help me! He attacked
me, he's trying to kill me!

43:35.540 --> 43:38.845
- OK, OK.
- Bullshit, Detective!

43:39.204 --> 43:42.728
She drugged me and she
dragged me out here.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.380
She's trying to set me up.

43:44.420 --> 43:47.756
Why should I believe you
after what you did to me?

43:49.443 --> 43:51.626
- Get back!
- You don't scare me.

43:52.864 --> 43:56.100
- What are you doing out here?
- I got a warrant for your car tracker.

43:56.372 --> 43:59.020
Couldn't figure out what it was
doing all the way out here.

43:59.060 --> 44:01.566
Just arrest him, Detective!

44:02.390 --> 44:06.100
You can't arrest me right now,
with GHB in my system.

44:06.881 --> 44:08.959
Detective Harmon here knows that.

44:10.047 --> 44:11.453
Don't you?

44:12.291 --> 44:14.201
So I'm going to walk away.

44:15.022 --> 44:17.260
You're not just going to let him go?

44:18.300 --> 44:19.713
He's right.

44:21.591 --> 44:23.580
If we make an arrest now...

44:24.669 --> 44:27.667
..they'll turn this place over,
and you'll be the one in trouble.

44:28.721 --> 44:30.201
All right, then.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.220
You're going away for
what you did to me!

44:42.320 --> 44:45.940
My house is being examined
by Forensics right now.

44:45.980 --> 44:48.340
One speck of DNA and you're done.

44:48.380 --> 44:51.066
They're going to find proof
that you raped me.

44:53.808 --> 44:55.740
No, you won't, Detective.

44:57.180 --> 44:58.639
No, you won't.
