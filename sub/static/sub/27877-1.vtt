00:33.916 --> 00:35.916
[music]

01:39.916 --> 01:41.291
[man] There's obviously a mistake.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.791
We were notified the passes
would be waiting in our names.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.625
[attendant]
I'm sorry, but that's incorrect.

01:45.708 --> 01:47.833
- Morf Vandewalt, Artweb.
- [lady] No. It's today...

01:48.250 --> 01:49.333
[man 2] Hey, Morf.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.201
[man] Okay, I wanna speak
to someone in charge, please.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.500
- Lovely to see you again.
- [lady] This is ridiculous.

01:54.583 --> 01:57.208
We bought Shogrun's <i>Ultraworld</i>
last month in New York.

02:15.833 --> 02:19.125
[speaking Chinese]

02:20.166 --> 02:23.125
[gear grinding]

02:33.250 --> 02:35.750
[robotic voice]
Have you ever felt invisible?

02:36.666 --> 02:37.791
[gear grinding]

02:44.083 --> 02:46.666
Once, I built a railroad.

02:52.083 --> 02:55.833
- [man] There he is. Morf.
- Cloudio.

02:56.791 --> 02:59.375
It's Kenji, you probably know.
It's titled <i>Hoboman.</i>

02:59.458 --> 03:00.833
The response is amazing.

03:00.916 --> 03:02.625
- Arguably, the hit of the show.
- Hmm.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.333
Wolfson, <i>Female Figure,</i> four years ago.

03:05.791 --> 03:07.750
[Cloudio] No, it's new.
Vastly different themes.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.166
It's an iteration.

03:09.250 --> 03:12.000
No originality. No courage.
My opinion.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.763
[scoffs] Well, I absolutely respect
the power of your point of view,

03:14.833 --> 03:16.500
but this encompasses on a global scale.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.543
There's just such a sense of now
and in your face,

03:18.583 --> 03:20.666
which speaks to pop and cinema
and economics.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.916
I mean, you can feel the winds
of the apocalypse.

03:23.541 --> 03:25.208
I can't save you.

03:25.291 --> 03:28.541
We have a four-million-dollar hold,
a major buyer in Shanghai.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.208
Will you be running your review today?

03:40.583 --> 03:41.791
[phone camera clicks]

03:42.500 --> 03:44.250
[phone rings]

03:46.083 --> 03:47.476
- Hey.
- [Coco] <i>Do you have a minute?</i>

03:47.500 --> 03:49.166
No, I'm just heading inside now.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.625
<i>- I have to tell you something about Ricky.</i>
- What?

03:51.708 --> 03:54.375
<i>- Josephina, he's cheating on you.</i>
- Are you serious?

03:54.458 --> 03:56.916
<i>- I saw him with this girl.</i>
- When?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.375
<i>Last night at a bar.</i>

03:58.875 --> 04:00.875
- What?
<i>- They were both pretty drunk.</i>

04:01.041 --> 04:03.458
- Wha... What time?
<i>- I don't know. Ten?</i>

04:03.541 --> 04:06.083
<i>- They were all over each other.</i>
- Right at the fucking bar.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.833
<i>- I'm so sorry, Josephina.</i>
- Are you sure it was him?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.416
<i>They were standing right next to me.</i>

04:10.500 --> 04:11.541
I gotta go.

04:11.625 --> 04:12.916
<i>- Anything I can do?</i>
- No.

04:13.125 --> 04:15.250
Uh, thank you, seriously. Bye.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.916
- [man] Howzit, Morf?
- Hello, Jon.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.458
[Jon] Really something, eh?

04:22.125 --> 04:23.750
Is Piers sleeping with Dorothy?

04:23.833 --> 04:26.166
Oh, I'm certain
you'd have to ask him that.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.875
- [cell phone ringing]
- Excuse me.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.250
- Morf, love.
- Oh, Gretchen.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.125
We bid on it for the museum.
Jon wants three point seven.

04:37.208 --> 04:39.088
Rhodora would never
sell a Piers for under five,

04:39.125 --> 04:40.541
so it's a nice opportunity for us.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.916
I'm quite curious to know what you think.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.458
I think sober hasn't been good for him.

04:45.541 --> 04:47.250
Well, this was done fifteen years ago.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.958
Piers was in the full bloom
of alcoholism here.

04:50.041 --> 04:50.958
Exactly.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.791
So, you're saying it is a good buy
for the museum, then?

04:54.166 --> 04:55.208
Excuse me.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.458
Josephina.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.250
Are you okay?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.208
[tearful]
Literally, the worst fucking day.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.125
Ugh, your makeup.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.916
God, I'm late.
They texted, like, twenty times.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.250
I'm headed there, too.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.458
God, fucking people.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.333
- Who?
- Everyone.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.750
Is Piers switching galleries?

05:17.250 --> 05:20.750
I answer phones and get coffee.
I'd literally be, like, the last to know.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.083
[clapping]

05:22.708 --> 05:25.250
You're too late.
Rhodora already got her coffee.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.500
Are you where you wanna be?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.333
I'm not taking shit from the installer.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.083
[woman] What did you think?

05:37.250 --> 05:39.458
I haven't felt that in years.
[chuckles]

05:39.833 --> 05:42.250
- Morf is here.
- [woman] Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.333
[woman] Well?

05:49.833 --> 05:51.500
Color. Life.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.833
- I love it.
- [chuckles]

05:54.000 --> 05:55.833
I'm sick of white spaces.

05:55.916 --> 05:57.375
That is so strange.

05:57.541 --> 06:00.916
I've been drawn to a bolder booth presence
in terms of work and palette lately.

06:01.083 --> 06:04.541
Mm-hmm. This adherence to showing
in sterile, monochrome cubes.

06:04.625 --> 06:08.250
It's just laziness.
I wanted to get some juxtaposition going.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.833
I'm actually, I mean right now,
writing something exactly about this.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.625
- This wasn't in the catalog.
- Mm-mm.

06:17.541 --> 06:18.916
It's Minkins.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.333
It's called <i>Sphere.</i>

06:22.833 --> 06:26.250
It creates this unique sensation,

06:26.666 --> 06:30.416
depending on each person
and whatever hole they decide to explore.

06:30.916 --> 06:32.375
Just like life.

06:32.833 --> 06:35.166
It uses all sorts of sensors and gizmos.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.291
Ooh!

06:36.416 --> 06:39.791
It's about choice, desire, sex.
[chuckles]

06:40.041 --> 06:41.541
The whole enchilada.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.458
- [Morf] It's groundbreaking.
- Hmm, it's yours to break.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.250
Debuted ten minutes ago.

06:46.958 --> 06:48.958
I'm posting a review. How much is it?

06:49.541 --> 06:52.083
So much easier to talk about
money than art.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.166
[Morf] Funny.

06:53.583 --> 06:57.208
Speaking of, is Piers leaving you
for Jon Dondon?

06:57.666 --> 07:00.166
I've represented Piers
for seventeen years.

07:00.708 --> 07:01.833
That's not an answer.

07:02.375 --> 07:05.208
Well, why don't you put your hand in?

07:05.291 --> 07:06.583
See what you feel.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.208
- [lady] It's just not worth my investment.
- [man] You're mistaken.

07:20.291 --> 07:22.750
This is gonna be an uncommon
event experience,

07:22.833 --> 07:24.458
not to mention the tax incentive.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.791
- Is there water in Miami?
- At the bar, sir.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.500
- [man 2] I don't know.
- Fuck.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.458
[Jon] I can guarantee your position
as co-chair... Oh, excuse me.

07:31.666 --> 07:32.500
Piers.

07:32.583 --> 07:36.541
[Morf] I was floating in the ocean,
and, for this incredible moment,

07:36.625 --> 07:40.583
it felt like I had tapped into
a primal consciousness.

07:41.875 --> 07:45.291
A connection to the world
in its purest form.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.583
[phone beeps]

07:48.041 --> 07:49.583
Ricky's still denying it.

07:50.041 --> 07:53.250
"Please, baby, let me explain."
I swear to God, I want to hurt him.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.583
Maybe it will free you up for new things.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.125
This was a new thing. He'd just moved in.

07:59.041 --> 08:04.000
I have to say, I'm having my own
major second thoughts about Ed.

08:04.791 --> 08:07.541
He actually has some fantasy
about us getting married.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.333
I'm through dating artists.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.333
They're already in a relationship.

08:12.625 --> 08:13.750
[woman] <i>Look, Damrish,</i>

08:13.833 --> 08:17.458
your website doesn't give
a sense of scale or texture.

08:17.541 --> 08:20.625
But seeing your work in person
at the new-artists fair,

08:20.708 --> 08:23.916
I had that "Oh, my God" moment.

08:24.416 --> 08:28.458
It charges and mauls and devours.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.958
Six months ago,
I was living on the street,

08:31.041 --> 08:34.791
showing on the sidewalk.
So, that's where I'm coming from, right?

08:35.332 --> 08:36.332
Let me fill you in.

08:36.875 --> 08:41.000
All this... it's just a safari to hunt
the next new thing and eat it.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.000
I heard you were the one to watch out for.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.208
Oh, I'm easy-peasy.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.666
Pussycat, really.

08:47.083 --> 08:50.250
I know all about you,
going back to your punk days.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.083
Oof, that was many moons ago.

08:52.166 --> 08:55.208
- <i>Velvet Buzzsaw.</i>
- Yeah, well, the name was catchy.

08:55.291 --> 08:56.916
Yeah, the early stuff was great.

08:57.208 --> 08:59.208
Then it became, what? Like, self-parody?

08:59.416 --> 09:00.916
I mean, after Polly left,

09:01.750 --> 09:02.833
why'd you split up?

09:03.125 --> 09:05.708
Who remembers through
all the booze and pills.

09:05.791 --> 09:06.791
But the point is,

09:07.458 --> 09:11.541
I've gone from anarchist
to purveyor of good taste.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.750
- [scoffs]
- So, I get the joke.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.708
None of this is new.
It's all been done since

09:16.916 --> 09:19.583
someone charged a bone
to see the first cave painting.

09:20.416 --> 09:21.416
Here you are.

09:22.291 --> 09:23.791
So... Thank you.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.541
What cave are you showing in?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.583
Me and my dudes started a collective.

09:28.333 --> 09:29.853
- Mmm. Well, cheers to that.
- [clinks]

09:34.291 --> 09:37.916
Well, hell knows, I love loyalty,

09:39.291 --> 09:41.500
but I would kill to exhibit you.

09:42.041 --> 09:45.000
I just turned down an offer
for a full show from Jon Dondon.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.541
Ugh. And on and on.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.958
He's inside right now
trying to poach Piers.

09:49.875 --> 09:51.250
You know where I am, Damrish?

09:51.791 --> 09:54.125
I'm here doing shots with you.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.250
Club soda. Lime.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.500
The market always tiers up for you, Piers.

10:01.291 --> 10:04.416
Listen, my intolerance
for your bullshit is zero.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.875
<i>Lekker, </i> no bullshit.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.708
Look, Rhodora overpriced you.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.791
She's lost it.
She's completely out of touch.

10:10.875 --> 10:13.166
I sold <i>Cranial</i> today
for three point seven,

10:13.250 --> 10:14.458
exactly what I said I'd get.

10:14.541 --> 10:17.583
If you come with me,
our gallery has cutting-edge analytics

10:17.833 --> 10:20.541
to maximize deal flow and global demand.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.333
I am fighting to get back to creation,

10:23.416 --> 10:27.708
to revelation, the billion years of energy
sparking through our brain.

10:27.791 --> 10:30.958
I'm not jetting around,
hawking fucking tickets.

10:31.041 --> 10:33.458
In an attention economy,
celebrity is art form.

10:33.541 --> 10:35.916
Do you understand
that I only commission new work?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.916
Repros, prints, replicas are all marketed
under my own brand.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.583
My <i>boet, </i> I'm more than ecstatic to partner
you exclusively on your future work.

10:44.875 --> 10:48.750
I hear Rhodora sold <i>Sphere</i>
for seven million.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.833
Ugh. Man, it's a carnival attraction.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.458
It's brilliant.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.375
I never should've quit drinking.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.333
Josephina.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.750
Are you going to SLS?

11:08.750 --> 11:10.708
I'm going to a satellite show
outside of town.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Well, I'll come.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.333
[Josephina] <i>What's going on with you?</i>

11:18.416 --> 11:19.416
What do you mean?

11:20.541 --> 11:22.250
You're Morf fucking Vandewalt.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.333
What are you doing
coming to a grant show with me?

11:25.250 --> 11:26.416
I like being with you.

11:27.125 --> 11:28.666
We have a taste relationship.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.958
Is that tobacco?

11:33.416 --> 11:34.416
Hash oil.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.375
Maybe I'll have one little puff.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.916
[coughs]

11:50.291 --> 11:53.500
[Morf] <i>Okay, that was the worst show
I've seen in years.</i>

11:54.041 --> 11:57.333
- And who was that angry guy when we left?
- You don't know?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
That was Imeldus Vanderhorst.
You panned him last year.

12:02.708 --> 12:04.583
Grab two Tito's from the fridge.

12:06.958 --> 12:09.458
You know,
you're in much better shape than Ricky.

12:10.125 --> 12:14.583
I... do a lot of Pilates and Peloton.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.708
I remember your body.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.000
I remember yours.

12:22.291 --> 12:25.625
Ever since Berlin, I find myself
thinking all the time about you.

12:26.458 --> 12:27.708
We were wasted.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.666
I keep telling myself that.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.541
Your skin.

12:32.750 --> 12:36.750
It's the most beautiful cross
between almond and saddle brown.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.875
I make you hard, huh?

12:42.708 --> 12:44.166
You make me confused.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.208
Tough headspace for a critic.

12:56.208 --> 12:59.583
[airplane flying]

13:09.041 --> 13:12.041
[Rhodora] <i>Got back to LA late last night
and looked at the numbers.</i>

13:12.750 --> 13:13.750
<i>My God.</i>

13:14.041 --> 13:16.083
<i>Aside from the peachy Minkins sale,</i>

13:16.208 --> 13:19.250
Miami was really
not a very great thriving market.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.750
Brass tacks, we didn't move one Rubek.

13:22.458 --> 13:26.541
I know the London office
has a hard-on for him, but to my mind,

13:26.625 --> 13:31.458
the last thing we need to waste time on
is trying to flog some pop-art revival.

13:31.541 --> 13:32.625
[phone beeps]

13:34.250 --> 13:35.791
- Pop-art.
- [beeps]

13:37.041 --> 13:38.875
- [louder] Pop-art.
- [beeps]

13:38.958 --> 13:40.208
Fuck me.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.583
[sighs]

13:46.791 --> 13:48.791
[mysterious music]

14:02.958 --> 14:04.625
Hey. [inhales deeply]

14:05.041 --> 14:08.458
"Star of the Nova section
was Mertilla Splude's Go-Pro Kindergarten,

14:09.166 --> 14:12.500
an inspired disquisition
of early-age experience."

14:13.916 --> 14:15.708
Hmm. [inhales deeply]

14:16.625 --> 14:19.125
Well, get inspired
and come join me in the pool.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.708
[suspenseful music]

15:23.291 --> 15:24.708
[man] Is he all right?

15:25.583 --> 15:26.625
Call 911.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.708
[man breathes heavily]

15:29.541 --> 15:30.833
[cat meows]

15:38.625 --> 15:40.708
[phone ringing]

15:41.375 --> 15:42.708
Who's supposed to be here?

15:42.791 --> 15:45.833
Josephina. She's late... again.

15:47.291 --> 15:50.166
You, Rococo.
Take the reception desk.

15:50.250 --> 15:54.041
It's... It's Coco, actually. Um...

15:55.166 --> 15:57.166
Haze Gallery. Can I help you?

15:58.625 --> 15:59.625
Hello?

16:01.375 --> 16:02.916
[man laughs]

16:03.416 --> 16:06.833
Hang up, right?
Yeah, rich people are impatient.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.791
I'm really an artist, you know?

16:11.791 --> 16:16.291
I did, um, <i>Bandini's Froot Loop Hippo,</i>
you know that?

16:16.958 --> 16:19.125
And I glued on all the Froot Loops.

16:19.791 --> 16:20.875
Yeah.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.500
It's at The Broad right now.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.041
Not broad.
People confuse it with Broad.

16:26.125 --> 16:27.625
- Broad, brode, yeah.
- Right.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.666
But I can get us tickets if you want.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.125
They know me there.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.750
- When did you get back?
- [Morf] <i>Last night.</i>

16:35.291 --> 16:37.958
I have solid confirmation
Piers has left you for Jon Dondon.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.125
I'm going to get bored now.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.625
<i>This feels huge to me.
Why would he leave?</i>

16:42.708 --> 16:44.708
Why, why why. Why anything?

16:45.375 --> 16:46.666
Maybe I wanted him to leave.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.541
Meanwhile, I'm signing new talent.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.083
Heard you got Damrish. He's fierce.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.625
And this morning, Mertilla Splude.

16:54.708 --> 16:57.958
We are on the same frequency, I swear.

16:58.416 --> 17:02.000
- Go-Pro Kindergarten's <i> gonna break big.
- </i> Your lips, God's ear.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.333
Oh, wait. In our world, you are God.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.415
And I'm running late. Gotta go.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.583
Okay.

17:09.665 --> 17:10.665
[kisses]

17:11.375 --> 17:13.290
- [sighs] I'm sorry.
- [phone ringing]

17:14.000 --> 17:16.915
Some random guy just, like,
died in my building.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.458
[gasps] I really am so surprised.

17:19.833 --> 17:20.915
Rhodora, I'm not kidding.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.625
A neighbor actually died.
I found the body.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.958
Bryson keeps me up to speed
on everything that goes on around here.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.458
Your chronic lateness...

17:28.540 --> 17:29.875
Bryson's pissed because...

17:31.375 --> 17:33.833
he came on to me
and I shut him down.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.375
He's a flat-out creeper.

17:35.541 --> 17:38.000
Well, I can say the interest
I had in you has waned.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.333
I thought I was grooming a protégé.

17:40.416 --> 17:44.666
All our long talks about your struggles
and grand ambitions.

17:44.750 --> 17:48.375
And then you insult my intelligent mind.
I'm moving you off the front.

17:48.458 --> 17:52.458
No client contact until you raise
the quality bar in your performance.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.958
- Morning.
- [staffers] Good morning.

17:56.041 --> 17:59.416
[Rhodora] Do we have Berlin?
Singapore? London? Oh, we do.

17:59.791 --> 18:03.458
So, I have two new favorite artists
I am all kinds of happy to tell you about.

18:30.416 --> 18:31.541
[man] I'm from Perlack.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.958
We own the building.

18:36.916 --> 18:37.916
Did you know him?

18:38.333 --> 18:39.333
The guy who died?

18:40.500 --> 18:42.000
Some sorta artist, I guess.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.125
No.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.791
I found his body.

18:47.625 --> 18:48.750
He liked his privacy.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.583
- He had a cat.
- It's up there. We'll find it tomorrow.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.166
Jesus, the stuff inside...

18:54.791 --> 18:58.208
And it all gets tossed.
The old man wanted everything thrown away.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.958
No trace, his instructions.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.916
Looks like he started to do it himself,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.833
but he died
before he could finish the job.

19:04.791 --> 19:05.791
[chuckles]

19:07.291 --> 19:08.291
[man] Well, good night.

19:16.708 --> 19:18.250
[cat meows]

19:40.541 --> 19:42.541
[door creaks]

19:42.958 --> 19:44.958
[suspenseful music]

19:49.833 --> 19:50.958
Hey, kitty, kitty.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.208
[door closes]

19:59.083 --> 20:01.083
[floor creaks]

20:13.291 --> 20:15.333
[suspenseful music continues]

20:55.458 --> 20:57.458
[suspenseful music intensifies]

21:42.166 --> 21:43.416
[gasps]

21:43.708 --> 21:45.916
- [breathes heavily]
- [meows]

21:47.875 --> 21:49.041
Hey, little guy.

21:52.875 --> 21:53.875
Hey.

22:10.666 --> 22:12.666
[suspenseful music intensifies]

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
Hey.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.833
Ah, so glad you called.

22:25.791 --> 22:27.416
I'd hug, but I'm all sweaty.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.500
Love the jumper.
Cornsilk's a great color for you.

22:31.708 --> 22:33.208
Miami was a revelation.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.583
Let me just start with that.

22:37.416 --> 22:41.500
I don't know where I am with anything else
in my life, other than that I feel...

22:42.958 --> 22:44.166
good with you.

22:45.208 --> 22:48.333
So much better, and beyond good.

22:48.833 --> 22:49.958
I found something.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.083
That's what I'm saying.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.583
Who did these?

23:28.750 --> 23:30.083
What do you think of them?

23:32.666 --> 23:33.875
They're visionary.

23:34.166 --> 23:35.375
[chuckles]

23:38.583 --> 23:40.875
Mesmeric. An absolute incredible...

23:43.250 --> 23:45.750
mix of mediums.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.375
I'm ensorcelled.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.708
- Do you think there's a market for it?
- Massive.

23:56.208 --> 23:57.208
Beyond.

24:01.041 --> 24:02.541
Who represents them?

24:05.041 --> 24:06.041
I do.

24:07.875 --> 24:10.750
[laughs] I'm dying with suspense.

24:10.833 --> 24:11.833
Who is it?

24:13.416 --> 24:16.125
[TV announcer]
<i>Tonight's jackpot is 400 million dollars.</i>

24:16.541 --> 24:19.916
<i>To win that jackpot,
you must match these five white balls.</i>

24:20.166 --> 24:24.875
<i>The first winning number tonight is 54.
That's followed by 32.</i>

24:24.958 --> 24:29.291
<i>Up next we have 52.
Your next number is 34.</i>

24:29.375 --> 24:33.250
<i>Your final white ball
for this Friday evening is 25.</i>

24:33.416 --> 24:35.416
<i>If no one matches the five numbers...</i>

24:35.666 --> 24:38.875
It just seemed edgier at the Biennale.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.166
Oh, is this the exact lighting?

24:43.541 --> 24:44.541
[tech] I think so.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.791
Okay, well, go check the specs.

24:47.083 --> 24:49.083
[TV continues playing indistinctly]

25:05.791 --> 25:08.375
I run the collective Damrish belongs to.

25:08.458 --> 25:12.000
Oh. I didn't think
collectives had people in charge.

25:12.291 --> 25:14.291
Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose?

25:14.833 --> 25:16.250
I represent him.

25:16.333 --> 25:17.333
Used to.

25:17.458 --> 25:21.041
We're building something away
from all this commercial bullshit.

25:21.125 --> 25:22.708
It's not just about the fucking money.

25:22.791 --> 25:25.375
Stealing Damrish away would end us.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.791
Okay. Well, you know what?
He's not a child.

25:27.875 --> 25:29.291
It's his choice, not mine.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.500
- You think this is done?
- Back the fuck up!

25:35.583 --> 25:37.625
I tried to stop him.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.416
Okay, well, you failed.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.333
Unbelievable.

25:46.125 --> 25:49.083
- [Coco] It will... never happen again.
- Go!

25:52.750 --> 25:54.750
[phone ringing]

26:03.250 --> 26:06.958
Coco! Didn't you tell me
you wanted to get a cat?

26:07.500 --> 26:08.500
Um...

26:09.166 --> 26:10.541
can we talk about it later?

26:12.625 --> 26:13.625
Sure.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.250
[Josephina] Hey!

26:18.708 --> 26:21.541
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- What is this? Who is this?

26:21.625 --> 26:22.541
That was under my desk.

26:22.625 --> 26:25.250
I was looking for tape and I saw this.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.708
- This is harassment.
- Tell me who the artist is.

26:27.791 --> 26:31.458
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I do more than maintenance and packing.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I'm not just a man of primitive skills.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.458
This shit... talks to me.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.750
[Gretchen] Hey, you.
I heard you were coming by.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.541
I'm reviewing your Purlfoy exhibit.

26:54.625 --> 26:57.041
Oh, be kind.
Our membership is plummeting.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.708
Tell me something. Have you ever heard
of an artist named Vetril Dease?

27:01.791 --> 27:02.791
D-E-A-S-E.

27:04.166 --> 27:05.000
No.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.166
Can you check?

27:11.458 --> 27:14.000
No. Not in our records,
and we have everyone.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.000
Morf, honey, I, uh...

27:20.958 --> 27:23.125
- I need to bend your ear.
- Mmm?

27:23.791 --> 27:28.291
I am leaving to become an art adviser.

27:28.375 --> 27:31.083
[squeals] I know, I know.
I can't say for whom.

27:31.250 --> 27:35.125
But I will be making enough to afford
a terribly lovely car and garden.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.708
Oh, hello, Morf.

27:37.166 --> 27:38.166
Hello, Jim.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.666
Look, I came to the museum

27:42.750 --> 27:45.666
because I wanted to change
the world through art.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.958
But the wealthy vacuum up everything,
except crumbs.

27:49.041 --> 27:51.625
The best work is only enjoyed
by a tiny few.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.458
And they buy what they're told.
So, why not join the party?

27:54.541 --> 27:56.791
Mmm. It's everywhere, the money question.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.041
In advance of my move, I am...

27:59.750 --> 28:02.666
actively looking for purchases
for my new client.

28:02.958 --> 28:05.833
You might be interested to know

28:06.041 --> 28:09.000
that I can provide to you a generous,

28:09.083 --> 28:13.333
untraceable reward for anything
you steer me to in the realm of

28:13.750 --> 28:16.500
undervalued, pre-review, perhaps.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.083
I don't do that.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.750
What's your arrangement with Rhodora?

28:25.875 --> 28:26.875
None.

28:27.583 --> 28:32.000
Then her buys prior to your favorable
reviews are utterly prescient?

28:32.083 --> 28:33.083
This is my life.

28:33.625 --> 28:37.083
How I connect with some sort
of spirituality at actual present.

28:37.166 --> 28:38.458
Mm-hmm, of course.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.625
I assess out of adoration.

28:41.125 --> 28:43.041
I further the realm I analyze.

28:44.458 --> 28:45.583
Forgive me, I...

28:46.083 --> 28:47.083
Fuck.

28:48.125 --> 28:49.125
[scoffs]

28:50.291 --> 28:51.291
[Gretchen] Kisses.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.458
[sirens in distance]

29:02.708 --> 29:03.875
[knock at door]

29:15.583 --> 29:17.625
Hey. What's going on?

29:18.791 --> 29:19.791
You tell me.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.250
What are you doing here?

29:28.666 --> 29:30.083
Hell's bells.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.041
Bryson.

29:33.083 --> 29:36.333
- [Rhodora] Incredible.
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

29:37.416 --> 29:39.625
Not if you had a gun.

29:39.708 --> 29:41.166
It's none of your business.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.333
Oh, actually it is.

29:45.041 --> 29:49.208
You signed a non-compete clause,
which, if you read, you might remember is

29:49.916 --> 29:52.625
very much quite a lot broader than that.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.000
Tell me all about Vetril Dease.

29:58.041 --> 30:01.500
Hmm. [chuckling]
His name is the tinsel on the tree.

30:03.625 --> 30:06.541
Don't make me pull
some sort of heavy interrogation.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Right now, it's just you and me,

30:11.250 --> 30:14.000
with all our active friendship
and love for each other.

30:16.458 --> 30:19.333
Now, how did you get all of these?

30:21.625 --> 30:23.916
A guy upstairs. He died.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.916
And you just took them?

30:27.041 --> 30:28.583
He had no family or friends.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.375
Well, I won't bother
with the obvious questions,

30:34.458 --> 30:36.916
but, oh, you must have some giant plans.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.666
I invented do-it-yourself.

30:40.750 --> 30:43.541
And you're in way over your head, babe.

30:44.416 --> 30:48.375
You have to archive and catalog
and establish ownership.

30:50.291 --> 30:51.583
And monetize.

30:53.916 --> 30:58.041
I'm willing to do all of that
for... a reasonable percentage.

30:59.333 --> 31:02.125
You can engage me
in an endless lawsuit, or...

31:02.833 --> 31:04.041
you can become rich

31:04.541 --> 31:06.541
and famous and successful.

31:07.291 --> 31:09.791
Which is what we both know
you've always wanted.

31:09.875 --> 31:10.875
Hmm?

31:25.125 --> 31:28.267
We can claim the property was abandoned
if she says she found it in the dumpster.

31:28.291 --> 31:31.791
- And took steps to find a rightful owner.
- Well, first reports are he had no heirs.

31:31.875 --> 31:34.195
She's just a tenant.
Could the building owner make a claim?

31:34.333 --> 31:36.541
The salvage guy said
that they were junking everything.

31:36.750 --> 31:39.166
I mean, it took hours to carry it all down
into my apartment.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.416
There was just so much of it.

31:40.500 --> 31:44.000
No, you found the art in the trash,
not in his apartment.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.333
This is very important.

31:45.416 --> 31:49.000
Now, remembering back,
you found it in the dumpster.

31:49.083 --> 31:50.208
Isn't that what happened?

31:52.041 --> 31:53.041
The dumpster.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.333
Yeah, I remember now.

32:10.541 --> 32:13.250
Critique is so limiting
and emotionally draining.

32:14.833 --> 32:18.208
I've always wanted to do something
long-form, beyond opinion.

32:19.250 --> 32:23.083
Dip my toe into an exploration
of origin and essence.

32:23.916 --> 32:26.625
A metamorphosis of spirit into reality.
[chuckles]

32:28.625 --> 32:31.041
I've... I've never had the vehicle
until now.

32:32.833 --> 32:34.583
An artist toiling in the recesses,

32:34.666 --> 32:36.986
discovered in death.
I wanna start researching immediately.

32:37.041 --> 32:40.000
Well, there's timing. Meshing with
our extensive marketing plans,

32:40.083 --> 32:41.323
which we haven't gotten to yet.

32:41.375 --> 32:43.375
Well, I'm willing to write
the exhibit brochure.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.300
That will give immediate weight
to the launch.

32:46.041 --> 32:48.916
And in return,
I want exclusive rights to a book

32:49.000 --> 32:51.708
and several pieces.

32:54.083 --> 32:55.500
Well, that sounds swell.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.750
[tense music]

33:09.625 --> 33:11.083
[phone vibrating]

33:13.416 --> 33:14.416
Hi, Rhodora.

33:16.083 --> 33:21.208
Well, I'm archiving his material,
then running spectrums on his paint.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.541
And it's the damnedest thing.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.833
I don't even know how to account for it.

33:28.541 --> 33:30.000
I couldn't hazard a guess.

33:32.583 --> 33:34.083
[Coco] Haze Gallery, please hold.

33:34.875 --> 33:36.291
Haze Gallery, please hold.

33:36.791 --> 33:38.333
Haze Gallery, please hold.

33:39.458 --> 33:42.416
Yes, Josephina's unavailable right now,
but I can take a message.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.541
Okay, please hold.

33:45.166 --> 33:46.166
Haze Gallery.

33:46.625 --> 33:50.416
Uh, yes. Rhodora is aware of the meeting,
but she's on a call right now.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.625
[phone rings]

33:52.166 --> 33:54.291
[Rhodora]
<i>You're positive it's the same Dease?</i>

33:54.375 --> 33:56.416
- [P.I.] <i>Yeah.
- Well, how can you be sure?</i>

33:56.500 --> 33:59.333
<i>I visited the institution.
I found his records.</i>

33:59.625 --> 34:01.791
- [Rhodora] <i>Dear God.
- I wouldn't worry.</i>

34:02.375 --> 34:05.625
<i>The file's so old, there's no backup.
I took the only copy.</i>

34:05.708 --> 34:08.750
Okay, send it over.
And wash your hands of it.

34:08.833 --> 34:11.208
<i>- And add a zero to your bill.
- Thanks.</i>

34:17.541 --> 34:21.791
[Morf] <i>Vetril Dease first appears
in a 1930 Los Angeles census,</i>

34:22.375 --> 34:25.875
<i>living in a low-income home with
his father, mother and younger sister.</i>

34:27.416 --> 34:30.125
<i>Nine years later,
Vetril is listed with his father</i>

34:30.208 --> 34:33.791
<i>as the only survivors of a suspicious fire
which swept their house.</i>

34:34.791 --> 34:37.791
<i>Shortly after the fire,
Vetril's named in a court document.</i>

34:37.916 --> 34:40.416
<i>Citing cruelty
beyond the bounds of humanity,</i>

34:40.541 --> 34:43.750
<i>child protection services remove Vetril
from his abusive father</i>

34:43.833 --> 34:47.333
<i>and place him in the Good Templars
Orphanage in South Vallejo.</i>

34:48.125 --> 34:50.125
<i>His time there is a mystery,</i>

34:50.791 --> 34:53.958
<i>the only record being his departure at 18.</i>

34:55.000 --> 34:57.666
<i>But the real mystery is what follows.</i>

34:57.750 --> 35:02.375
<i>Dease disappears for three decades,
vanishing like a ghost.</i>

35:02.625 --> 35:07.083
<i>He suddenly resurfaces on the payroll
of the Sawtelle veterans administration,</i>

35:07.291 --> 35:10.916
<i>where he was employed as a janitor
for 42 years.</i>

35:11.625 --> 35:14.375
<i>Dease lived alone and isolated,</i>

35:15.208 --> 35:18.708
<i>using his art to dive deep
into his own psyche.</i>

35:19.958 --> 35:22.958
<i>The artist battled for decades
with his personal demons.</i>

35:23.875 --> 35:27.083
<i>The result is an epic saga
of violence and madness.</i>

35:27.750 --> 35:31.250
<i>A howl for answers
and a resolution that never comes.</i>

35:35.750 --> 35:39.291
My ex-boyfriend, Ricky,
has an exhibition Friday.

35:40.666 --> 35:42.250
- He's a hack.
- [kisses]

35:42.958 --> 35:45.416
A bearded, downtown poser.

35:45.666 --> 35:46.833
[breathes heavily]

35:47.458 --> 35:48.500
[grunts]

35:48.750 --> 35:53.583
You know, he hasn't had, like,
an original idea in his whole life.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.375
[breathes heavily]

35:55.458 --> 35:58.416
On top of which, he steals from everyone.

35:58.708 --> 36:00.125
But you know that, right?

36:00.541 --> 36:02.541
I'm very familiar with his work.

36:03.750 --> 36:04.833
[Josephina moans]

36:06.666 --> 36:08.041
You should go to his show,

36:09.375 --> 36:12.666
see for yourself how much he sucks.

36:13.250 --> 36:16.958
- [moans] Then do what you do.
- Are you serious?

36:17.041 --> 36:19.541
[breathes heavily] For me.

36:20.416 --> 36:21.625
[moans]

36:31.250 --> 36:32.250
Hello, Morf.

36:34.916 --> 36:35.750
Right.

36:35.833 --> 36:36.833
Is it contemporary?

36:36.916 --> 36:39.583
It cuts through the bullshit
and gives form to true emotion.

36:39.708 --> 36:42.041
- What does it say?
- What do you feel?

36:42.458 --> 36:45.125
They're using tech in a whole new way.

36:45.500 --> 36:48.833
The idea is aiming for a platform
that includes all media.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.791
Everything's interruptive now.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.500
[Rhodora]
He came from nowhere, knew no one,

36:53.791 --> 36:57.125
and if our industrious Josephina here
hadn't been so observant,

36:57.250 --> 36:59.583
his genius work would've been thrown away.

36:59.916 --> 37:03.708
And, um, he would've been
consigned to oblivion.

37:04.208 --> 37:08.083
I spotted it by a streetlight
over a dumpster.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.666
[man] Approximately,
how many pieces are there?

37:11.083 --> 37:12.250
Well, unfortunately,

37:12.333 --> 37:16.583
Mr. Dease's output was the opposite
from what one would call prolific.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.833
And he's certainly not making any more.

37:18.958 --> 37:21.708
[woman]
There's one we're very interested in.

37:21.791 --> 37:24.166
Well, just know demand
has people ready to kill.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.041
- Ya! [chuckles]
- [kisses]

37:26.666 --> 37:27.500
Fetchin'.

37:27.583 --> 37:29.750
Before the sublime,
the whole body quivers.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.666
Mm-hmm. Well, at these prices,
your museum's locked out.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.833
Well, I just yesterday left the museum,
so I can speak freely now.

37:36.041 --> 37:38.625
- I'm an adviser for a private buyer.
- Whom?

37:38.916 --> 37:40.666
Our friend who bought <i>Sphere.</i>

37:41.000 --> 37:42.916
- Well, how hilarious for you.
- [chuckles]

37:43.000 --> 37:44.041
In that capacity,

37:44.125 --> 37:47.000
I do have my eye on several
of the large-format product for him.

37:47.083 --> 37:50.333
Mmm. Well, the sales staff
have been busy beavers.

37:50.541 --> 37:51.958
Everything's on reserve.

37:52.458 --> 37:53.833
Perhaps we'd pay a premium.

37:54.083 --> 37:56.666
- That doesn't butter the biscuit.
- Well, what the fuck would?

37:57.416 --> 37:58.916
I'll sell you two Dease

37:59.000 --> 38:01.833
if you buy three pieces
at Damrish's opening next month.

38:01.916 --> 38:04.291
[chuckles] What if my client
doesn't respond to Damrish?

38:04.375 --> 38:06.916
Well, you're the adviser. Advise.

38:08.166 --> 38:09.166
Hey.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.375
[mysterious music]

38:47.208 --> 38:48.208
[Damrish] Damn.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.083
[Rhodora] Next month, it's your show.

38:56.666 --> 38:58.333
I gotta... I gotta go.

38:58.416 --> 38:59.416
Okay.

39:00.375 --> 39:02.375
[mysterious music continues]

39:24.291 --> 39:28.583
Isn't it exhilarating
to see something substantial?

39:29.208 --> 39:31.583
I mean, other than celebrity
tattoo artists and

39:32.500 --> 39:35.541
balloons for painting tools.
I'm writing a book about him.

39:35.916 --> 39:38.416
I just loathed your Ricky Blane
review yesterday.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.125
I thought his show was inspired.

39:41.125 --> 39:43.333
Well, I didn't get it, I suppose.

39:43.416 --> 39:45.708
I felt that we saw
totally different exhibits.

39:46.500 --> 39:50.750
Mmm. A bad review is better than
sinking into the great glut of anonymity.

39:52.041 --> 39:53.166
Was that a joke?

39:54.625 --> 39:55.750
Not that I'm aware of.

39:57.083 --> 40:00.041
Ricky got drunk
and crashed his car last night.

40:00.125 --> 40:01.458
He's in coma.

40:01.541 --> 40:02.916
I heard he was crushed.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
By the car?

40:05.666 --> 40:07.833
Your review. <i>Arschloch.</i>

40:17.916 --> 40:20.875
[Josephina] What do you mean, Bryson's
moving some of the art to storage?

40:20.958 --> 40:23.083
Well, if De Beers released
all their diamonds,

40:23.166 --> 40:24.583
they'd be cheap as cut glass.

40:24.833 --> 40:26.875
Didn't they teach
any of this in art school?

40:26.958 --> 40:28.708
How many are we saying he made?

40:28.958 --> 40:32.875
Well, their value's their scarcity,
so it's not what we say. It's the reality.

40:32.958 --> 40:35.916
The reality is we have over
one thousand pieces stored upstairs.

40:36.083 --> 40:37.750
Well, that's nonsense.
[chuckles]

40:37.833 --> 40:40.083
Why, I doubt if it's even
half that number.

40:40.166 --> 40:41.583
[Josephina]
What have you done?

40:41.666 --> 40:45.750
[Rhodora] Removed them from circulation.
Locking them away for a rainy day.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.500
[somber music]

42:06.208 --> 42:08.208
[truck accelerates]

42:12.958 --> 42:14.083
[lighter clicks]

42:35.375 --> 42:36.375
Fuck.

42:36.875 --> 42:37.916
Fuck! Fuck!

42:38.666 --> 42:40.458
[screams] Fuck!

42:49.208 --> 42:51.166
[grunts]
[breathes heavily]

42:59.125 --> 43:00.500
[shouts]

43:13.541 --> 43:16.041
- [door opens]
- [grunts]

43:21.625 --> 43:23.666
Oh! Shit. Shit!

43:33.583 --> 43:34.916
Oh, shit.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.500
[yells] Hello?

43:45.500 --> 43:46.500
[slams door]

43:51.416 --> 43:53.416
[mysterious music]

44:09.166 --> 44:10.500
[breathing heavily]

44:23.500 --> 44:25.500
[grunts and groans]

44:39.750 --> 44:42.500
[screams]

44:42.583 --> 44:44.583
[monkey chatters angrily]

44:46.458 --> 44:48.458
[screams continue]

44:56.541 --> 44:58.541
[door buzzer rings]

44:59.125 --> 45:00.291
<i>Howzit? It's Dondon.</i>

45:03.166 --> 45:04.583
[door unlocks]

45:05.166 --> 45:07.166
[door buzzer rings]

45:10.666 --> 45:13.750
- [dog growls]
- {Piers] Easy, boy. Not yet.

45:16.458 --> 45:18.458
Studio visit. I'm excited.

45:19.791 --> 45:22.458
I can't stomach cheery or upbeat.

45:22.541 --> 45:24.541
I'm not an idiot. Remember that.

45:24.625 --> 45:26.392
Hey, I'm honored
to be your new representative

45:26.416 --> 45:27.601
and see what you've been up to.

45:27.625 --> 45:28.750
I just bet you are.

45:28.833 --> 45:31.250
So, this is where the magic happens?

45:32.166 --> 45:33.291
Is that a joke?

45:34.416 --> 45:35.416
Sorry?

45:36.416 --> 45:39.125
This is repros and replicas.

45:39.458 --> 45:41.041
Studio's upstairs.

45:41.416 --> 45:42.833
Rupert, up.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.791
This is remarkable.

46:04.541 --> 46:05.541
It's not art.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.375
[Jon mutters]

46:19.625 --> 46:20.625
[sighs]

46:31.291 --> 46:32.291
[Piers] Well?

46:34.208 --> 46:35.208
Well, I...

46:35.500 --> 46:38.708
I'm just soaking it in.
It's thrilling to see a work in progress.

46:39.041 --> 46:42.875
Just give me an honest goddamn opinion
about what you're looking at.

46:44.458 --> 46:47.166
I can see a line
with your body of work. So...

46:47.666 --> 46:49.416
So, I'm copying myself?

46:49.500 --> 46:51.416
It's not copying if it's your canon.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.458
I thought your studio was downtown.

46:56.250 --> 46:58.208
Too many addiction triggers.

46:59.041 --> 47:01.958
- I worked here the last year.
- Well, I... [chuckles]

47:02.041 --> 47:04.375
I'd love to see all the new work
you've done since moving,

47:04.458 --> 47:07.708
because the team is geared up and ready
to sell every new piece you have.

47:21.958 --> 47:23.916
[scoffs]
Right.

47:26.291 --> 47:27.375
Sure, of course.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.666
No, you've... you've been gestating.

47:32.708 --> 47:34.708
Gestation implies birth.

47:35.250 --> 47:38.833
Ideas come, but they kill themselves
as soon as they appear.

47:40.083 --> 47:41.541
This is a slaughterhouse.

47:42.666 --> 47:43.958
Welcome aboard.

47:53.375 --> 47:56.583
[detective] When we got the call,
it took us a few days to locate you.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.375
We've been busy.

47:58.791 --> 48:01.458
Now, it looks he slid
into the side of a gas station

48:01.541 --> 48:03.666
out in Angeles National Forest.

48:04.041 --> 48:05.791
Place has been closed for years.

48:07.833 --> 48:09.250
What caused the crash?

48:09.791 --> 48:10.791
Don't know.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.625
Think he may have hit his head
and wandered off.

48:15.208 --> 48:16.708
It's easy to get lost out there.

48:18.291 --> 48:19.541
Was anything recovered?

48:19.625 --> 48:21.250
Well, we put it in the back here.

48:21.333 --> 48:24.750
We think the vehicle may have been
vandalized before we located it.

48:25.291 --> 48:27.000
There's a big homeless camp near there.

48:27.208 --> 48:29.248
They would've cleaned it out
if they found it first.

48:29.791 --> 48:31.958
Was there anything of value
you know was inside?

48:33.083 --> 48:34.083
[Rhodora] No.

48:34.791 --> 48:35.958
Not that I know of.

48:37.208 --> 48:38.500
This is all you found?

48:39.208 --> 48:40.541
Uh, no.

48:41.166 --> 48:42.166
There was this.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.125
[Josephina] <i>Where did he go?</i>

48:47.833 --> 48:49.000
Where's the art?

48:49.291 --> 48:50.971
Why would you trust him
in the first place?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.750
I didn't tell him what was in the crates.

48:52.875 --> 48:56.375
All he had to do was deliver them
to a warehouse in Lancaster.

48:56.458 --> 48:58.708
This shit goes sideways,
and I'm telling you straight up,

48:58.791 --> 49:01.958
I will say this was all your idea.
I had nothing to do with it.

49:05.833 --> 49:06.916
[line ringing]

49:07.291 --> 49:09.666
<i>This is Bryson's phone.
Obviously, I didn't pick up.</i>

49:10.708 --> 49:13.083
Bryson, it's me.

49:14.041 --> 49:15.625
Where the fuck are you?

49:17.250 --> 49:20.041
You trying to strong-arm me,
cash in on your own? What?

49:20.125 --> 49:22.125
[car accelerates]

49:24.208 --> 49:26.208
Don't fuck with me, Bryson. Call me.

49:29.750 --> 49:31.166
[Morf] I came at the right time.

49:31.250 --> 49:33.208
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles] No, no. Not now.

49:33.291 --> 49:34.291
I have a lot to do.

49:35.083 --> 49:38.958
- Wha... It's not for three hours.
<i>- </i> It'll take me that long to get ready.

49:39.500 --> 49:40.708
It's just a fundraiser.

49:41.666 --> 49:43.125
There's going to be pictures.

49:43.625 --> 49:46.333
Our first time out.
This is super important to me.

49:46.916 --> 49:48.000
I wanna look good.

49:48.541 --> 49:50.250
Mmm, I found a sick dress.

49:51.375 --> 49:54.000
This sofa's completely too small
for the ceiling height.

49:54.500 --> 49:55.625
It swims in here.

49:59.750 --> 50:02.875
So, I've been cataloging
paintings for the book.

50:04.666 --> 50:06.000
Something doesn't add up.

50:06.833 --> 50:07.833
What's that?

50:09.458 --> 50:12.583
There's almost no studies or sketches.
They seem to be missing.

50:13.666 --> 50:16.666
As well as large gaps
from different periods of his work.

50:19.833 --> 50:21.125
He dated them, you know.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
No, everything I found is there.

50:24.291 --> 50:25.875
Trust me, I'd know.

50:26.750 --> 50:29.875
Hey, I've got some
great champagne in the fridge.

50:29.958 --> 50:31.375
Open it while we get ready.

50:40.333 --> 50:42.333
[woman speaking Italian]

50:48.541 --> 50:51.416
[Jon in Italian]
Stop by before you leave. [kisses]

50:52.208 --> 50:55.208
Your three o'clock is here.
Interview for the archivist opening.

50:58.250 --> 50:59.250
You're too young.

51:01.750 --> 51:02.750
[Coco] Uh...

51:03.458 --> 51:04.958
I'm twenty-two.

51:05.416 --> 51:08.041
The position requires someone
with years of experience.

51:08.291 --> 51:09.916
Stop back when you're forty, eh?

51:11.333 --> 51:12.333
That's it?

51:12.625 --> 51:14.041
That is it.

51:21.750 --> 51:22.916
You worked for Rhodora?

51:27.666 --> 51:29.208
Just for a few weeks.

51:29.291 --> 51:31.750
So, the non-compete clause doesn't apply.

51:32.208 --> 51:34.375
- She fired you?
- I was on a break.

51:34.458 --> 51:37.041
A man walked in and talked to her,
and she never let it go.

51:37.125 --> 51:38.666
You were there for the Dease opening?

51:40.125 --> 51:42.416
- It was a zoo.
- You know how much she generated?

51:43.458 --> 51:45.125
- I saw the numbers.
- The buyers list?

51:46.416 --> 51:47.416
Every name.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.416
- Your client bought two.
- [chuckles]

51:51.083 --> 51:52.125
Very resourceful.

51:53.916 --> 51:56.125
I've learned that you have to be.

51:59.333 --> 52:04.500
Rhodora had, um, a file on Dease
that she kept locked away.

52:05.875 --> 52:08.000
One day I found the key and...

52:09.166 --> 52:11.583
it was a very interesting read.

52:11.666 --> 52:12.666
[chuckles]

52:13.166 --> 52:14.750
You know what? I might have an opening.

52:16.291 --> 52:18.583
Come back to my office
and tell me what else you heard.

52:31.166 --> 52:32.625
[car alarm beep]

52:32.875 --> 52:36.625
[Gretchen] Ah, I do miss it here.

52:36.708 --> 52:40.541
The camaraderie, the purity of purpose,

52:41.083 --> 52:44.833
the Tuesday meatloaf
as the cafe overlooking the tar pits.

52:44.916 --> 52:48.666
- [chuckles]
- Well, on to Vetril Dease.

52:49.083 --> 52:52.250
In the united federation of the universe,

52:52.333 --> 52:55.875
I doubt there is a hotter artist
at the moment.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.208
Do you know, since the exhibit opening,
he's actually trending on Twitter.

52:59.291 --> 53:00.916
We're interested in showing him.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.875
How many pieces are we talking about?

53:02.958 --> 53:05.416
I can supply two owned by my client.

53:05.500 --> 53:08.125
And another ten on loan
from the Haze Gallery.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.250
Send dimensions and JPEGs for the group,
and we'll aim for a spot next season.

53:13.333 --> 53:14.833
[chuckles]

53:15.291 --> 53:17.208
I want them exhibited ASAP.

53:17.708 --> 53:19.541
Main hall, new wing.

53:20.125 --> 53:22.500
- Event marketing.
- You know we have a process, Gretchen.

53:22.583 --> 53:27.500
Ooh! I had a glorious concept
to support my former employer,

53:27.583 --> 53:30.875
and supposed premier
contemporary art museum of Los Angeles,

53:30.958 --> 53:33.166
with a first showing of a Dease!

53:33.250 --> 53:35.500
We appreciate the significance,

53:35.583 --> 53:37.333
but there is the issue of space.

53:37.500 --> 53:41.500
Well, move Banyo's <i>Horse Penis</i>
or the <i>Jeweled Vagina.</i>

53:41.583 --> 53:43.791
Put one inside the other for all I care.

53:43.875 --> 53:47.125
There is a tax issue, and my client
wants his Dease exhibited immediately.

53:47.208 --> 53:51.000
Now, in return for my very generous offer,

53:51.375 --> 53:54.041
I also want Minkins' <i>Sphere</i> to be shown.

53:54.125 --> 53:56.041
Oh, come on, Gretchen,
this isn't a rug bazaar.

53:56.125 --> 53:58.416
No, it's an equation
with a solution at the end.

53:59.041 --> 54:00.250
And if you can't grasp that,

54:00.333 --> 54:03.458
there are other museums,
I assure you, that will.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
[Jim] Ah.

54:09.083 --> 54:10.083
Kisses.

54:30.375 --> 54:32.083
[car alarm beep]

54:33.625 --> 54:35.666
[suspenseful music]

55:03.458 --> 55:04.458
- [loud bang]
- Oh!

55:06.458 --> 55:08.041
[exhales] Sorry.

55:09.083 --> 55:10.291
I didn't see you there.

55:13.291 --> 55:15.625
Hi. I'm Morf Vandewalt.

55:15.708 --> 55:18.375
I'm here researching Vetril Dease.

55:18.958 --> 55:22.625
- I'm... writing a book about him.
- What for?

55:26.291 --> 55:30.625
He's... He's become a prominent artist
in... in the outsider school.

55:30.916 --> 55:32.666
Did... Did you work with him?

55:34.041 --> 55:35.083
Eighteen years.

55:36.875 --> 55:38.555
[Morf] Well, it would be extremely helpful

55:38.583 --> 55:40.303
if we could arrange a time
to talk in depth.

55:40.375 --> 55:43.875
You see, I have so many questions,
and there's so few people who knew him.

55:45.666 --> 55:47.333
There was a vet you could've talked to.

55:48.583 --> 55:50.958
He had a few medals and a loud mouth.

55:51.041 --> 55:54.625
[grunts] Liked to ride people,
particularly Dease.

55:55.458 --> 55:58.000
[grunts] He wound up dead in a field.

55:58.583 --> 55:59.791
Hands tied.

56:00.916 --> 56:02.416
Never found who did it.

56:03.083 --> 56:04.083
[grunts]

56:05.833 --> 56:07.541
So, you're saying it was Dease?

56:08.041 --> 56:10.000
- [screams] Damn it!
- Oh! Jesus.

56:12.791 --> 56:15.166
I'm saying you left him the fuck alone.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.083
Look, I have nothing more to say.

56:19.166 --> 56:21.291
And you can tell
that other damn fella that, too.

56:21.541 --> 56:22.583
Who?

56:23.208 --> 56:24.833
The one who came by here yesterday.

56:25.375 --> 56:26.916
I don't know who that would be.

56:27.666 --> 56:28.708
[exhales]

56:29.458 --> 56:30.458
Here.

56:37.750 --> 56:40.416
[P.I.] Well, we've corroborated
Dease's twenty-year incarceration,

56:40.541 --> 56:43.083
using court documents, police records,

56:43.625 --> 56:44.833
and work history.

56:45.791 --> 56:48.750
Dease left
the Good Templars Orphanage at 18.

56:49.666 --> 56:52.541
He was drafted.
Served two years in the army.

56:53.250 --> 56:54.416
And when he got out,

56:54.875 --> 56:56.875
he suffered some sort of a breakdown.

56:58.166 --> 56:59.166
At that point,

56:59.875 --> 57:02.875
he tracked down his abusive father
and murdered him.

57:03.541 --> 57:05.083
He didn't kill him right away, though.

57:06.333 --> 57:07.875
He dragged it out for days,

57:07.958 --> 57:10.750
torturing him, then burning him alive.

57:11.875 --> 57:15.958
Dease spent two decades in a psychiatric
hospital for the criminally insane.

57:16.625 --> 57:19.458
The facility used inmates
for medical experiments.

57:20.750 --> 57:22.250
<i>Injections, shocks.</i>

57:22.333 --> 57:23.666
<i>God knows what else.</i>

57:24.083 --> 57:25.250
[electricity buzzes]

57:26.083 --> 57:27.541
They were human guinea pigs.

57:27.833 --> 57:29.833
Dease got released
when the courts closed it.

57:30.041 --> 57:31.041
From there he goes to LA

57:31.375 --> 57:34.208
and got a job at the veterans home
and lived off the grid.

57:35.125 --> 57:38.333
No bank account, car, license.

57:39.041 --> 57:40.541
Couldn't even find a usable photo.

57:41.666 --> 57:44.166
And you verified all this?
You're sure?

57:44.916 --> 57:45.958
It all checked out.

57:46.458 --> 57:47.458
Those are the facts.

57:48.083 --> 57:50.541
All right, I'm gonna release this
tomorrow. I'm gonna need you

57:50.625 --> 57:53.000
to speak to the press,
attesting to your credentials,

57:53.083 --> 57:54.916
the authenticity
of what's in the file, and...

57:55.000 --> 57:59.541
and the atrocious and disturbing nature
of what you found, et cetera, et cetera.

58:01.291 --> 58:04.250
I thought this kind of stuff
would raise the value of his work.

58:04.333 --> 58:05.458
Oh, no, no.

58:06.125 --> 58:07.375
This is another level.

58:08.625 --> 58:10.791
- Have a good night.
- Nighty-night.

58:23.166 --> 58:25.041
<i>You've reached Morf. Leave a message.</i>

58:25.791 --> 58:27.250
Howzit, Morf? It's Jon.

58:27.333 --> 58:30.213
Give me a call back as soon as you can.
I have something regarding Dease.

58:30.291 --> 58:31.875
I think might interest you greatly.

58:32.625 --> 58:34.625
[mysterious music]

58:41.416 --> 58:43.416
[projector sound in distance]

58:45.416 --> 58:47.416
[whirring]

58:52.416 --> 58:53.416
Hello?

58:54.500 --> 58:56.333
[mysterious music intensifies]

59:24.458 --> 59:26.583

59:28.833 --> 59:30.041

59:57.125 --> 59:59.125
[mysterious music continues]

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.541
Hello? [slamming door]

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:12.416
What the hell?

01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:42.291
[projector stops]

01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:04.791
[mysterious music intensifies]

01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:09.708
[gasps]

01:01:20.958 --> 01:01:22.958
[mysterious music ends]

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:40.458
Jon?

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:49.458
[wind blowing]

01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:07.833
Jon?

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.875
[screams]

01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:14.666
[breathes heavily]

01:02:18.041 --> 01:02:20.041
[funeral organ music]

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:23.875
[Morf] Oh, we are just stuck in here,
aren't we?

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.166
What is with that cheesy organ music?

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:37.875
And that casket. What color is that?

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:40.750
Smog orange? Did he buy it on sale?

01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:42.375
[chuckles] Not so loud.

01:02:43.416 --> 01:02:47.166
Seriously, imagine having to spend
an eternity in that.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.000
Jesus.
Nothing is ever good enough for you.

01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:53.541
Well, it's my job. I'm selective.

01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:56.250
What are you even saying?

01:02:56.916 --> 01:02:58.375
Toss out taste and standards?

01:02:58.708 --> 01:02:59.958
Whisper the truth?

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.083
What a tragic world that would be.

01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:05.958
Oh, hi.

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:08.166
I'm Josephina.

01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:11.500
I work with Rhodora.
I'm a partner at the gallery.

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:15.000
- Oh, yeah. Damrish.
- Oh, of course. [stammers]

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:18.833
- I am just such a huge fan your work.
- Thank you.

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:20.708
I do the Dease collection.

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:23.625
It's otherworldly.

01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:26.541
- Thank you.
- Your review of <i>Hoboman</i> killed the sale.

01:03:26.666 --> 01:03:29.416
Instead of being seen,
it's gathering dust at a storage facility.

01:03:29.958 --> 01:03:31.708
I am not your mouthpiece.

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:34.291
[sighs deeply]

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
God.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.333
We competed for everything,

01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:51.208
but I absolutely despise
being here for this.

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:55.125
I mean, what was he facing,
to do something like that?

01:03:56.583 --> 01:04:00.166
He was his usual shallow self
the last time we spoke.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.708
Started drinking again.

01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:06.291
Ooh, happy days.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:11.458
[clears throat] Um, this here
is for family and friends only.

01:04:11.958 --> 01:04:12.958
Mmm.

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:16.041
Well, Jon started at my gallery, so...

01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.625
I mean, where the hell else would I sit?

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.541
[clergyman]
Ladies and gentleman, if we may begin.

01:04:24.916 --> 01:04:26.796
- [Josephina breathing heavily]
- [Morf moaning]

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:29.958
- Did you take a Viagra or something?
- [Morf grunts] I'm almost there.

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:33.708
- [Josephina] No. I'm going on my back.
- [grunts]

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:36.375
- [Morf] No.
- I can't stay like this.

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:39.166
[Josephina moans]

01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:43.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[moans]

01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:45.083
Open your eyes.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.583
[grunts] I'm down here.

01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:54.291
[moans]

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:55.500
[gasps]

01:04:55.583 --> 01:04:57.250
Oh, God damn it.

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:00.166
Something's wrong.

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:03.458
We've got a fucking problem. Literally.

01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:05.458
I'm seeing things, um...

01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:07.833
Things moving.

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:11.083
Seriously, I'm really scared.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.041
I was turned on by your passion,

01:05:13.125 --> 01:05:14.958
from listening to your intelligent mind,

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:17.083
and now you've turned into
I don't know what.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.333
Your reviews have fallen off,

01:05:23.166 --> 01:05:25.166
and you still have feelings for Ed,
admit it.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:26.916
I do not have feelings for Ed.

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:30.625
Gretchen ran into him, and he said that
you two were talking and working it out.

01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:32.166
Well, Ed is a big liar,

01:05:32.416 --> 01:05:33.750
and Gretchen is a bitch!

01:05:33.833 --> 01:05:37.541
- I checked your phone. You made six calls.
- He was moving out, we were coordinating.

01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:39.458
What do you mean,
my reviews have fallen off?

01:05:40.208 --> 01:05:41.500
You're right.

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:43.666
Your edge. Makes sense.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:46.750
You don't know what you like
or even want.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.833
I'll tell you what I did like.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.916
[raised voice] Ricky Blane's show.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.041
But you jammed me to crush him!

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.083
Don't lay that on me.

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:58.166
Like he was your first bad review.
Gimme a break.

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:01.500
I'm not saying that I blame you.

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.875
- I'm saying that I regret it.
- [crying]

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.583
Hey, uh...

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:13.000
I think that I've been staring too long

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:16.083
at all this Dease art
and all his material.

01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:20.250
I'm... I'm gonna get my vision checked.
This will pass.

01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:22.333
- Hey.
- [breathing heavily]

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:26.250
Listen to my intelligent mind.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.500
[Piers] Well?

01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:39.000
I'm not pickled.

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:43.458
It's a small step, I suppose,
toward something, but

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.041
let's talk turkey.

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.416
What are you afraid of?

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:51.041
We go way, way back.

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:55.958
I wanna share with you
a little somethin' somethin'.

01:07:05.708 --> 01:07:08.291
"Dependency murders creativity.

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:11.833
Creativity plays with the unknown.

01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:17.791
No strategies exist
that can enclose the endless realm

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:19.458
of the new.

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:22.208
Only trust in yourself

01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:24.583
can carry you past your fears

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:27.000
and the already known."

01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:32.083
That's Polly Anna, 1983.

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:35.541
I found it clearing out her apartment
after she OD'd.

01:07:37.666 --> 01:07:40.416
I gave up being an artist a long time ago,

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:42.541
but I know how this works.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:44.625
Forget about the art world.

01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:47.750
You need to get away from here,
from all this. Take a break.

01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:50.500
Use my beach house and stay there

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:53.333
until you do something
for nobody but yourself.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.041
[doctor] Which one's better? One.

01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:03.041
- Two.
- [Morf] Two.

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:06.000
[doctor] All right. Two.
One. Better, worse, no different?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:08.916
No different.

01:08:09.666 --> 01:08:11.208
All right. There we go.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:15.833
All right. Well,

01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:20.457
your acuity has actually improved
since your last prescription.

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:24.000
I was hoping you'd find something
to explain what's happening.

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:26.125
Mmm. The phantom movements?

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:28.500
I think I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:30.957
Hallucinations, visions, moving objects.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:32.875
You've been on the Internet. Yeah.

01:08:33.041 --> 01:08:35.791
[inhales] It's highly doubtful
in the absence of other factors.

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:39.416
But let's make another appointment
for this week.

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:43.582
I dilated your eyes,
so you have to wear these for a few hours.

01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:48.457
These are heinous.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:53.500
[car beeps]

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.250
Shit.

01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:04.541
- Fuck.
- [phone rings]

01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:07.625
Yes, who is this?

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:10.416
- It's me.
<i>- Oh, how clever. You blocked your number.</i>

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.291
'Cause you won't answer my calls.

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:15.791
<i>Well, after your vile voice message
yesterday, are you surprised?</i>

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.582
- Wha... I... [grunts]
- [car approaching]

01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:21.791
Telling Josephina I am still with Ed?

01:09:21.875 --> 01:09:24.707
- Oh! That's my crime?
<i>- We broke up.</i>

01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:27.291
I was coordinating with him moving out.

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:30.125
Honestly, I expected an apology.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:33.957
<i>Ed said precisely there was more to it
than that. I merely passed it on.</i>

01:09:35.541 --> 01:09:37.166
[muffled shouting] You're a joke!

01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:40.791
You have no credibility in any way!

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:43.832
Oh, really? Well, in that case,
I suppose there's no truth whatsoever

01:09:43.916 --> 01:09:47.250
in your little friend Josephina
sniffing around Damrish, who, might I add,

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:50.291
are literally about to drive off
into the sunset together.

01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:53.750
[car engine starts]

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:56.208
[tires screeching]

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:07.833
[Morf] Gita?

01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:11.083
- Yes.
- Hi.

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:13.416
- I'm Morf Vande...
- Vandewalt.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.875
- Yes.
- Of course. I've read you for years.

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:17.125
Yes. [mutters]

01:10:17.791 --> 01:10:20.333
Are those the new Persols?

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:23.125
Yeah. That's right.

01:10:24.041 --> 01:10:25.041
Mmm.

01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:27.083
That's a Freud.

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:30.000
- Yes, it is.
- I've never seen that one before.

01:10:30.166 --> 01:10:32.500
It's been in a crate since '92.

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:34.250
And it's going back in one.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:39.375
I loved your exhibit brochure
on Dease, by the way.

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:41.208
Thank you.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.875
As I said on the phone,
I'm expanding it into a book.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.125
Well, there's enough there for one.

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:51.166
You cataloged the collection presale.

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:52.583
Oh, not cataloged.

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:56.958
My primary focus became
Dease's distinctive methodology.

01:10:57.625 --> 01:11:02.166
I spent three weeks identifying
conventions, workflow, classifications.

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:06.083
It was almost impossible to delineate
between working materials and

01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:08.208
personal effects.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.333
Frankly, I was glad to finish.

01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:13.541
[Morf] Hmm.

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:17.500
Well, I wasn't aware
there were any personal effects

01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:19.125
besides the ones in my possession.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.333
None in a traditional sense.

01:11:22.416 --> 01:11:24.291
I mean, as in tissue.

01:11:24.791 --> 01:11:26.125
[chuckles]

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:29.458
Paper?

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:32.958
Perhaps you should speak with Rhodora.

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:34.958
Rhodora is...

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.125
backing the book.

01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:41.416
I have her full support
and confidence, of course.

01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:49.958
Tissue as in blood serum.

01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:52.791
The artist's, I assume.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:56.333
He used it to create
the reddish blacks and the shadows.

01:11:57.791 --> 01:11:59.458
It was in every piece we studied.

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:05.583
[Jim] <i>That is an outrageous request.
Even coming from you.</i>

01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:08.083
I don't get your pushback on a Minkins

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:11.583
retrospective here, in the fall,
of all his major works.

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:13.375
We already agreed to put up <i>Sphere</i>

01:12:13.458 --> 01:12:15.375
in exchange for you
bringing us twelve Dease.

01:12:15.458 --> 01:12:19.000
Seriously, Gretchen, it's rude and dumb.
If you wanted to ram more

01:12:19.083 --> 01:12:21.958
of your collector's hoard down our throats
to increase their value,

01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:24.267
you should have done so
before the Dease deal was locked,

01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:26.125
not the night before the exhibit's open.

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:29.416
I hear marketing has high hopes
of a traveling Dease collection.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.041
They've even run projections.

01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:35.208
[inhales] So, I believe my "leverage"
looking ahead is considerable.

01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:36.166
Mm-mmm.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.916
There's absolutely no space in the fall
to put on a Minkins show.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.250
Well, I'm going to meet
with your board tomorrow

01:12:41.333 --> 01:12:45.166
and suggest a reduction
in the emerging artist exhibit.

01:12:45.958 --> 01:12:47.416
They don't sell any tickets anyway.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.583
- Over my dead body.
- [sighs]

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:54.541
[exhales deeply]

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.708
[Coco] Um, Gretchen?

01:13:01.708 --> 01:13:04.291
The hard copy PR material's been sorted,

01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:06.666
and the electronic kits
get sent at midnight.

01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:07.791
Be here early.

01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:10.458
And inform me
of any celebrities or art stars.

01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:15.291
Um, if it's all right with you,
I'd like to go home

01:13:15.375 --> 01:13:17.000
and get a few hours of sleep?

01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:20.458
Has the lighting been corrected on <i>Sphere?</i>

01:13:21.166 --> 01:13:23.500
Oh, the side lights, yes.
I had them leave it lit,

01:13:23.583 --> 01:13:25.000
so you could see it when you leave.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.500
Then run along.

01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:31.625
[Coco] Good night.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.208
[door opens]

01:13:43.916 --> 01:13:45.208
[door closes]

01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:47.666
[ominous music]

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:11.375
[giggles]

01:14:34.041 --> 01:14:36.041
[ominous music intensifies]

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:04.458
[scoffs]

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:06.875
[exhales]

01:15:08.541 --> 01:15:09.791
[music sting]

01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:12.333
[stutters loudly]

01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:16.625
[shouting] Help!
[screams]

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.083
Help!

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.500
- [arm crunching]
- [screams]

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:38.208
[“Für Elise” ringtone playing]

01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:39.291
Hello.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:42.875
No.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:45.583
When?

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.500
This morning.

01:15:49.166 --> 01:15:51.125
Somehow she got stuck inside of it.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.541
<i>There was some kind of malfunction,
and I guess it just, like,</i>

01:15:58.416 --> 01:16:01.041
completely took her arm off
and she bled to death.

01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:03.333
<i>It was horrible.</i>

01:16:04.791 --> 01:16:07.291
Security guards thought
it was part of a new installation,

01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:09.208
so they just opened up and let people in.

01:16:10.916 --> 01:16:13.333
<i>The Dease pop-up announcement
was blasted last night,</i>

01:16:13.416 --> 01:16:14.791
<i>so everyone was heading there.</i>

01:16:16.416 --> 01:16:18.625
People just walked by
like she was part of an exhibit.

01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:22.250
<i>Then a school tour came along.</i>

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.666
The kids thought it was fake blood,

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:28.458
<i>so they just started stepping in it
and spreading it around and...</i>

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:31.625
Who knows how long
it would have gone on for

01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:34.250
until Coco came in to do press
for the Dease show,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
<i>and she saw Gretchen and just lost it.</i>

01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:39.458
[screams]

01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:43.500
Are you still there?

01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:45.375
<i>Rhodora?</i>

01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:46.708
I don't understand.

01:16:48.458 --> 01:16:50.875
Bryson, then Jon. Now Gretchen.

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:53.375
What the fuck is going on?

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:54.875
I don't know.

01:16:56.416 --> 01:16:58.375
<i>I mean, we just saw her last night.</i>

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.208
<i>They closed that wing
of the museum, but...</i>

01:17:03.291 --> 01:17:05.375
I hear the Dease exhibit is mobbed.

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:07.833
[Rhodora shooing]

01:17:07.916 --> 01:17:09.625
- Hey. Go.
- [meows]

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:13.041
We're spiking on Moments and Instagram.
It's a major hit.

01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:15.291
<i>Rhodora, are you still there?</i>

01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:17.166
<i>Did you hear what I just said?</i>

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:18.833
Yeah.

01:17:19.125 --> 01:17:21.250
The Dease exhibit is booming.

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:23.708
[doorbell rings]

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:26.875
There's someone at my door. I gotta go.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.083
[knock at door]

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:34.958
[sighs]

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:38.791
Did you...

01:17:39.375 --> 01:17:40.541
hear about Gretchen?

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:43.708
[crying] Did you?

01:17:45.458 --> 01:17:47.458
- Oh, Jesus.
- [exhales]

01:17:47.791 --> 01:17:49.875
- Can you believe it?
- You have to leave.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:52.125
[shouts] You just can't,
well, just walk in like this!

01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:54.958
Well, I need to be with someone right now.
I'd think you would, too.

01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:56.041
[tapping]

01:17:57.083 --> 01:17:58.125
What's going on?

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.666
Are you kidding me?

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:05.125
We're not together. I was clear.

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:07.625
You said, "a break."

01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:16.333
The admiration I had for your work

01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:19.958
has completely evaporated!

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.458
Hey, man,
I wasn't trying to jump your train, okay?

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:24.875
She said you two were done.

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:26.666
Are we? Are we?

01:18:28.625 --> 01:18:30.666
Say we don't share something real.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.125
I was never particularly obsessed.

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:43.083
Oh!

01:18:49.166 --> 01:18:50.208
[sniffs]

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
[sentimental music]

01:19:22.666 --> 01:19:23.666
[gasps]

01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:35.750
We expected you yesterday.

01:19:35.833 --> 01:19:39.291
We closed the exhibit for half a day
in anticipation, actually.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.750
I thought Artweb were clear on the timing.

01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:44.333
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:45.750
I know it's pre-debut.

01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:48.208
Just been experiencing
some personal matters.

01:19:48.833 --> 01:19:51.083
Then, of course, Gretchen this morning.

01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:53.916
- If this isn't a good time...
- No, it's fine.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.500
It's overdue.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:58.625
- I'll write my review and file it today.
- Hmm.

01:19:59.583 --> 01:20:02.791
Lillith Vanlandingham
is storming the world

01:20:02.875 --> 01:20:04.916
with her revolutionary
sound exhibits.

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:09.291
She won the Nam June Paik Award last year.
Her latest piece is called <i>Mysticete.</i>

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:13.416
As discussed, we have arranged for you
to experience the exhibit alone.

01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:18.125
[sighs]

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.833
[inhales deeply]

01:20:22.416 --> 01:20:24.291
[Morf] <i>Look at him standing there.</i>

01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:26.458
<i>He only embraces what he knows.</i>

01:20:26.541 --> 01:20:30.583
[male voice] <i>Undoubtedly one of the worst
exhibits of contemporary art history.</i>

01:20:30.666 --> 01:20:34.166
[Morf] <i>Piece for piece, it's the biggest
waste of steel since the </i> Titanic.

01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:36.583
[male voice 2]
<i>This painful exhibit should be bulldozed.</i>

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:40.416
[Morf] <i>Remove the spotlight of hype
and his latest work is a snoozefest.</i>

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.708
<i>Seriously, Ms. Minati,
I am talking to you.</i>

01:20:42.791 --> 01:20:44.125
[female voice echoing Morf]

01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:47.291
[Morf] <i>It seems you have no one
around you to say this. Stop it.</i>

01:20:47.416 --> 01:20:49.166
<i>Shut up the shed.</i>

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:51.976
<i>There are no redeeming qualities
to the show. Nothing but embarrassed...</i>

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.559
[male voice] <i>The best thing about the show
is the French rosé being offered.</i>

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:57.226
[male voice 3] <i>It's an ugly piece
to look at, and faintly nauseating.</i>

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:59.125
[Morf] <i>It's gone from innocent
and stupid...</i>

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:01.059
[male voice 4]
<i>I'll hate you forever for saying that!</i>

01:21:01.083 --> 01:21:04.291
- [male voice 5] <i>Lazily concealed.</i>
- [female voice] <i>Vile. Deceitful!</i>

01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:07.125
<i>- </i> [loud screeching]
<i>- Deceitful!</i>

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:08.750
[male voices] <i>Morf!</i>

01:21:08.833 --> 01:21:10.916
[male voice 6]
<i>Judgment should be judged.</i>

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:14.750
[male voice 7]
<i>It is a monumental failure.</i>

01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:16.375
[voices echoing]
Morf!

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:20.041
[overlapping voices]
[indistinct, distorted chatter]

01:21:20.916 --> 01:21:23.250
[male voice 8]
<i>Ricky Blane is the classic case</i>

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:25.958
<i>of presenting a poser as cutting edge.</i>

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:29.625
[indistinct voices shouting]

01:21:30.416 --> 01:21:32.125
[car skidding]

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:33.208
[bangs]

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:38.500
[gallery owner] Sorry for the delay.
Our computer crashed.

01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:40.333
We're... We'll start it now.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.750
[whimpering]
What did I just hear?

01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:46.583
Nothing. This is a soundproof room.

01:21:47.916 --> 01:21:48.916
Voi...

01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:52.041
Voices.

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.375
I've no idea.

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:58.125
<i>Mysticete</i> is a symphony
of whale intonation

01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:02.375
recorded 20,000 feet under the sea
in the Mariana Trench.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.416
You are up for this?

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:15.666
[breathes heavily]

01:22:22.458 --> 01:22:23.833
[Morf] <i>I am seeing things.</i>

01:22:23.916 --> 01:22:28.250
[breath trembling]
I'm hearing things.

01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:29.958
Unexplainable things.

01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:32.250
Impossible things.

01:22:33.708 --> 01:22:35.125
And this is hard to admit

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.500
as an adherent of the here and now

01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:40.750
and a denier of childish belief.

01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:45.041
But something truly goddamn strange
is going on!

01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:50.666
What happened to Bryson?

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:53.250
According to the police,
he had an accident

01:22:53.333 --> 01:22:54.625
and he wandered into the desert.

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:56.291
I spoke to the police.

01:22:56.375 --> 01:22:59.208
They have video surveillance of the night
that Bryson went missing.

01:22:59.291 --> 01:23:01.625
He was loading crates of art
into his truck.

01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:02.708
Okay.

01:23:03.375 --> 01:23:05.000
What was in those crates?

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:06.375
And all this relates how?

01:23:07.166 --> 01:23:08.208
Dease!

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:13.541
His altered mental state, tortured soul,
phases of the goddamn moon!

01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:14.916
[shouting] I don't know how!

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:16.375
These deaths.

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:18.083
The disappearance.

01:23:18.166 --> 01:23:20.375
Everything that is now happening,

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:22.666
it's all connected to his art.

01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:26.500
[breathing heavily]
Imbued with some spirit...

01:23:27.416 --> 01:23:31.125
cr... created out of some vital ideal.

01:23:31.208 --> 01:23:33.041
It's a bit Baroque, don't you think?

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:35.458
- I came here to warn you.
- Okay. [chuckles]

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.916
You know what?
It's been a fucked-up few weeks!

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.208
But listen to yourself!

01:23:40.291 --> 01:23:42.208
I spoke to the building owners
doing research.

01:23:43.416 --> 01:23:44.791
They were surprised

01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:47.250
to hear Dease's art was being sold.

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:48.458
Apparently,

01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:53.583
he left explicit instructions
that it all be destroyed.

01:23:53.666 --> 01:23:57.625
- What are you saying?
- [yelling] Stop selling Dease!

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.892
- It's an eight-figure collection...
- [sighs deeply]

01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:03.791
...and you want me to stop selling
over some spirit?

01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:05.875
I am writing an article about this.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:10.041
About Dease, his past, his methods,
everything that has gone down.

01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:13.000
- Well, you'll kill your career.
- Get rid of it.

01:24:13.458 --> 01:24:15.833
Box it all, all of it away.

01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:19.250
That's what I'm doing.

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:27.250
All art is dangerous, Morf.

01:24:30.916 --> 01:24:34.000
[Rhodora] <i>Oh, it's just been
a feeding frenzy since the debut.</i>

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:38.416
What's changed is we ran new metrics
and realized that

01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:41.291
we've been overly precious with supply.

01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:44.750
I sent you six Dease JPEGs,

01:24:44.833 --> 01:24:48.333
all available for immediate purchase
at the quoted price

01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:52.041
and destined for significant appreciation.

01:24:54.875 --> 01:24:56.833
All of them. Well, that's swell.

01:24:58.416 --> 01:24:59.708
I'll send the papers.

01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:03.083
Okay. Yeah.

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:04.958
I'll see you in Basel.

01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:06.625
[Josephina] What's going on?

01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:09.916
We closed the first phase on Dease.
Why are we selling more?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Morf is hell-bent on writing a story.

01:25:12.916 --> 01:25:15.125
He's connecting Bryson's disappearance

01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:18.333
and Jon and Gretchen's deaths
to the Dease art.

01:25:18.416 --> 01:25:21.208
He believes they're somehow
channeling some sort of...

01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:23.416
spirit.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.166
Spirit? [stammers]

01:25:25.708 --> 01:25:27.041
What kind of spirit?

01:25:27.125 --> 01:25:28.666
I don't know the varieties.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.625
So he writes some batshit story.
Who cares?

01:25:31.708 --> 01:25:34.833
We don't sell durable goods,
we peddle perception.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.333
Thin as a bubble.

01:25:36.916 --> 01:25:40.333
Call your buyers, sell as much Dease
as you can before he posts something.

01:25:44.666 --> 01:25:45.916
[door opens]

01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:48.458
[door closes]

01:25:49.083 --> 01:25:51.083
[ominous music]

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500
- Who's next?
- You have Roxy on one.

01:25:58.291 --> 01:26:02.041
[Rhodora] Hey, babe. Circling back on you
wanting some museum-quality Dease.

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:14.250
- [phone vibrating]
- [Morf sighs]

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.360
Baby, that's raw silk. Your shoes.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.541
Pop this.

01:26:40.666 --> 01:26:41.666
[pops]

01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:43.750
You've got strong hands.

01:26:45.791 --> 01:26:47.375
You ever look at this painting?

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.750
You ever notice anything
about this painting?

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:54.083
You look at it long enough and it moves.

01:27:00.041 --> 01:27:01.333
[Josephina sighs]

01:27:02.333 --> 01:27:04.333
- [clinks]
- [Josephina exhales]

01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:08.916
- Mmm.
- It's alive.

01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:14.333
- I've just sold it.
- What? I would have bought it.

01:27:15.375 --> 01:27:16.375
You couldn't afford it.

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:20.750
We don't want it.
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:27.291
- [moans]
- I gotta get down to Traction Avenue.

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:29.267
- I thought we were spending the night in.
- Yeah.

01:27:29.291 --> 01:27:31.833
Something just came up,
and I gotta take care of it tonight.

01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:33.875
You're blowing me off.

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:36.958
- I want you to come.
- [sighs]

01:27:38.041 --> 01:27:40.041
[breathes heavily]

01:27:41.583 --> 01:27:42.916
[phone vibrating]

01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:51.000
Why do you keep calling me?

01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:52.125
[Josephina] <i>Why?</i>

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:56.541
We break up, and you write an article
to completely destroy my livelihood.

01:27:56.625 --> 01:27:58.916
I am not doing this to get back at you.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.125
<i>It's Dease's art. I think any of us

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:04.875
So, you just blasted it out there?

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:07.416
Jesus Christ. I am reading it right now.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.958
Are you aware
that you've completely lost your mind?

01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:13.708
We don't realize the value of friends
until they're gone.

01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:17.833
I still consider you a friend, Josephina.

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:21.375
[shouting]
Go fuck yourself and lose my number!

01:28:23.416 --> 01:28:25.416
Well, fine, then. All right.

It's Morf.

<i>Oh, hi.</i>

01:28:35.833 --> 01:28:37.833
A timetable is moved up.

01:28:38.583 --> 01:28:41.375
I'm storing some art
and I'm leaving immediately.

01:28:41.458 --> 01:28:43.791
I need an assistant part-time here
while I'm gone.

01:28:43.875 --> 01:28:46.958
<i>- Well, I'm available.</i>
- Yeah. Can you start tonight?

01:28:47.166 --> 01:28:49.416
<i>Um, I guess so. Sure.</i>

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.916
I need to give you the keys to my house
and my storage space.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.875
There's an overlook on Mulholland,
right off Cahuenga.

01:28:56.166 --> 01:28:58.166
<i>- I know the one.
- </i> Good. I'll meet you there.

[car door opens and closes]

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.125
Mr. Vandewalt. Hi.

01:29:10.875 --> 01:29:12.458
I posted it, Coco.

01:29:14.291 --> 01:29:16.125
And with this article, I'm... I'm...

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:19.125
I'm pouring gas on myself.
I'm lighting a match.

01:29:19.916 --> 01:29:21.125
I don't have a choice.

01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:24.291
It has been revealed to me

01:29:25.291 --> 01:29:28.375
that there is some sort of larger power...

01:29:30.291 --> 01:29:34.500
some entity invested in our endeavor.

01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:37.666
Invested how?

01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.500
In... [breathes deeply]

01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:42.166

01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:45.500
of inviolate rules.

01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:49.500
Have I gone mad?

01:29:50.125 --> 01:29:52.041
Oh, not to me.

01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:54.333
I found both bodies.

01:29:54.416 --> 01:29:57.000
[stammers]
I'm sleeping with my lights on.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:00.333
On top of which,
if I don't land a steady job soon,

01:30:00.416 --> 01:30:02.000
I'm gonna have to go back to Michigan.

01:30:08.666 --> 01:30:10.125
I have to tell you something.

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:12.750
What?

01:30:13.583 --> 01:30:17.875
I was Rhodora's personal assistant, right?
I saw her checks, I rolled calls with her.

01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:20.666
I think she sometimes forgot
when I was on them.

01:30:20.875 --> 01:30:21.875
Tell me.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:26.333
Your ex-boyfriend, Ed, um...

01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:28.416
he worked for her.

01:30:29.375 --> 01:30:31.791
He worked her out.
He's a personal trainer.

01:30:32.291 --> 01:30:33.291
No.

01:30:33.958 --> 01:30:35.041
No, I mean...

01:30:36.125 --> 01:30:39.500
Rhodora paid Ed to give her
advance word on your reviews.

01:30:40.083 --> 01:30:43.208
Like, okay... He would tell her
what you liked before you posted,

01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:45.250
and then she'd make buys.

01:30:47.791 --> 01:30:48.833
[sighs]

01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:53.083
Do I still have the job?

01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:02.166
Here are the keys to my storage space.
I need everything itemized that's there.

01:31:02.541 --> 01:31:03.541
Okay.

How the fuck should I know?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.125
Where did you go?

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.666
This is Ben.
He runs my old artist collective.

01:31:30.333 --> 01:31:31.333
Hey.

01:31:35.166 --> 01:31:37.750
[scoffs] Lovely. Can we go now?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.083
I'm staying.

01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:41.375
But I don't really like this place.

01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:43.166
Yeah, I'm talking longer timeline.

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.375
I'm leaving Rhodora, her gallery.

01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:47.291
No, you're not.

01:31:47.875 --> 01:31:49.166
I can't be there.

01:31:49.666 --> 01:31:52.375
We have a significant show planned.
You're high. Come on.

01:31:52.958 --> 01:31:53.958
I'm serious.

01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:59.458
You're about to break big.

01:32:00.333 --> 01:32:02.041
We're taking you global.

01:32:02.833 --> 01:32:04.666
You'd give that up? For what?

01:32:05.208 --> 01:32:07.958
Some sad garage space
peddling graffiti murals?

01:32:08.041 --> 01:32:11.250
Jesus! What's the point of art
if nobody sees it?

01:32:30.708 --> 01:32:31.750
[loudly] Fuck!

I want it towed.

01:33:58.583 --> 01:34:00.083

Oh, 2057 Seventh Street.

<i>What do you mean, good for him?
What are you talking about?</i>

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.708
Josephina, are you aware that Dease asked
that all his art be destroyed?

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.583
Would it have changed anything?
