10:14.047 --> 10:16.917
SHE HAS A PIERCED NAVEL.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.753
THE PREDATOR USES
THIS INFORMATION

10:19.753 --> 10:20.888
TO FORM A BOND
WITH THE TARGET.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.890
- HE HAD TAYLOR'S PROFILE.

10:22.890 --> 10:23.924
HOW'S THAT HELPING
WITH EMILY?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.959
- WELL, THEY'RE SISTERS.

10:25.959 --> 10:30.430
I MEAN, EMILY'S INFO IS
ALL OVER TAYLOR'S SOCIAL MEDIA.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.801
- EMILY LIKES BAKING,
LOVES LENKA, THE TAR HEELS.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.402
SHE'S MAD AT HER PARENTS
FOR FIGHTING.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.937
- THE LITTLE GIRL
DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.139
- JUST IN CASE HE'S USING HER
FOR KIDDIE PORN,

10:39.139 --> 10:40.974
WE SHOULD RUN IT
THROUGH NCMEC.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.910
THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
HAS REALLY COME ALONG.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.946
- IT'S WORTH A SHOT,
AND MAYBE MERC AND THE SISTER

10:45.946 --> 10:47.414
CAN I.D.
WHOEVER TOOK HER.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.049
- OUR GUY'S A PRO,
MOVES FAST.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.951
GET EMILY'S FACE OUT THERE.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.020
WE'RE NOT LOOKING
AT A COLLEGE PARTY GONE WRONG.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.025
- HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
SHE WAS 15?

10:58.025 --> 11:00.861
SHE WAS STACKED!
YOU SAW 'EM.

11:00.861 --> 11:04.164
HEY, AS LONG AS THERE'S GRASS
ON THE INFIELD, YOU PLAY BALL.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.733
- GAME'S OVER, MERC.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.300
YOU'RE GOING DOWN
FOR KIDDIE PORN.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.904
THAT'S A LONG, DARK ROAD.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.272
- I'M GONNA WAIT
FOR MY LAWYER.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.742
- YEAH, YOU DO THAT.
ROLL THE DICE.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.810
YOU KNOW,
BUT ALL I'M ASKING

11:16.810 --> 11:18.879
IS AN INNOCENT QUESTION.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.914
RIGHT?

11:20.914 --> 11:26.854
DID YOU SEE EMILY
AT THE PARTY?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.288
- IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.025
- [sighs]

11:32.025 --> 11:33.994
- [slaps table]

11:33.994 --> 11:36.864
- SHE KIND OF HUNG BACK.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.298
- SHE HUNG BACK?

11:38.298 --> 11:41.001
- WAS SHE BY HERSELF
OR WITH SOMEBODY?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.335
- I SAW HER WITH PETER.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.737
- PETER WHO?

11:43.737 --> 11:44.972
IS HE
YOUR FRATERNITY BROTHER?

11:44.972 --> 11:46.039
- NO, OLDER.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.474
I DON'T KNOW HIS LAST NAME.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.977
HE WAS A BROTHER AT TAU OMEGA
OUT WEST.

11:49.977 --> 11:53.180
HE SHOWS UP AT PARTIES
WITH...SUPPLIES.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.382
- WHAT, DRUGS, ALCOHOL?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.017
- LIKE THAT.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.987
WITH HIS SISTER WENDI.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.289
- WELL,
PETER'S THE SUPPLIER.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.423
WHAT'S WENDI?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.292
- I DIDN'T KNOW HER.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.527
I MET HER
IN THE HOTEL LOBBY.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.062
SHE SENT ME AN E-VITE.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.198
- BUT YOU GAVE THIS WENDI
YOUR EMAIL?

12:11.198 --> 12:14.201
- YEAH,
TO GET THE PARTY ADDRESS.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.069
- HOW THEY GOT
THE MALWARE ON THE PHONE.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.537
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:17.537 --> 12:21.408
- SHE PUT A SPYWARE PROGRAM
ON YOUR PHONE

12:21.408 --> 12:25.178
TO LEARN MORE PERSONAL DETAILS
ABOUT YOU AND EMILY.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.014
- SO THIS IS MY FAULT.

12:27.014 --> 12:30.417
- TAYLOR, BLAMING YOURSELF
ISN'T GONNA HELP YOUR SISTER.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.019
- [crying]
EMILY WAS LOOKING FOR ME.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.888
I HEARD HER KNOCK.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.791
- OKAY, CAN YOU
DESCRIBE WENDI?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.960
- SHE WAS IN HER 20s.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.896
UH...NOSE RING.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.197
SHE HAD BROWN HAIR.

12:44.197 --> 12:47.034
SHE WAS...A LITTLE BIT
TALLER THAN ME.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.970
- CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING SPECIFIC?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.106
- SHE HAD
A LEATHER WRIST BAND

12:53.106 --> 12:55.775
WITH A ROUND METAL THING
ON IT.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.412
- WE GOT SOMETHING.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.950
- CAPTAIN,
NEED TO CHECK THIS OUT.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.018
- HEY, WE GOT A HIT
FROM NCMEC.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.821
LED US TO THIS.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.156
"LINK FREE OR DIE."

13:09.156 --> 13:12.025
IT'S A WEB HOST
FOR ILLEGAL SITES,

13:12.025 --> 13:14.962
GUNS, DRUGS, REVOLUTION,
AND PORN.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.564
IT HOSTS A KIDDIE PORN SITE
CALLED LOLITAVILLE.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.870
- GOOD MORNING.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.972
I BOUGHT YOU
SOME NEW CLOTHES.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.174
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU IN THESE.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.042
SO SEXY.
YOU'LL LOVE THEM.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.878
- THAT'S STREAMING LIVE.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.312
- IT'S AS SOFT AS YOUR SKIN,
ISN'T IT?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.048
IT'S OKAY.
COME ON, TOUCH THEM.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.018
FEEL THEM.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.219
YEAH,
SAY HI TO EVERYBODY.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.054
- ARE WE TRACING THAT?
- YEAH, I'M--

13:41.054 --> 13:43.056
I'M HITTING BRICK WALLS.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.324
THIS IS COMING FROM NOWHERE.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.592
- THEY'RE JUST FOR YOU.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.861
AFTER YOUR BATH.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.564
I CAN HELP YOU
WASH YOUR HAIR.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.533
- [crying]
I WANT TO GO HOME.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.871
PLEASE, I'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.406
- WELL, HE PICKED
THE RIGHT VICTIM.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.408
SHE'S A PEOPLE PLEASER.
SHE'S NOT GONNA FIGHT BACK.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.910
- WELL, IT MIGHT
KEEP HER ALIVE.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.844
- GET UP.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.481
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO EVERYBODY FOR NOW.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.620
- ROLLINS,
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.022
- CAPTAIN, I AM TRYING.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.556
- WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW
EMILY'S ALIVE.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.891
I'M GONNA TELL TAYLOR.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.993
I NEED STILLS OF THAT.
- YEAH.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.935
[door opens]

14:27.935 --> 14:32.505
- HEY.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.909
TAYLOR.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.110
- THAT'S IT.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.513
THAT'S LIKE THE BRACELET
WENDI HAD.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.215
SHE SAID
HE WAS HER BROTHER.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.952
- DID YOU SEE HIM AND EMILY
LEAVE TOGETHER?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.254
- [crying]
NO.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.023
IS HE WITH HER, THOUGH?
DID YOU FIND EMILY?

14:50.023 --> 14:52.192
- NOT YET.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.695
BUT WE DO KNOW
THAT SHE'S ALIVE.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.197
- IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS,

14:57.197 --> 15:01.701
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

15:01.701 --> 15:05.172
OH, GOD.

15:05.172 --> 15:09.009
WHY DID I HAVE TO GO
TO THAT STUPID PARTY?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.280
MY SISTER--

15:24.224 --> 15:25.959
- I CAN'T TRACK THIS VIDEO
OR THE WEBSITE THAT HOSTS IT.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.295
IT'S USING ONION PROTOCOL,
SO IT'S ON THE DARK NET.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.130
I MEAN, THE IP ADDRESSES
ARE INVISIBLE.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.132
- TARU CAN'T CRACK IT?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.101
- NO, I MEAN, WE CAN ACCESS
THE SITES, FIND THE PORN,

15:34.101 --> 15:35.402
BUT...IT'S COMPLETELY
ANONYMOUS.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.471
WE HAVE NO WAY TO TRACK
WHERE IT'S COMING FROM.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.340
AND FINDING EMILY,
IT'S HOPELESS.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.975
- TURN THAT OFF.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.211
MR. AND MRS. CULPHERS?

15:44.211 --> 15:45.478
- ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT EMILY?

15:45.478 --> 15:47.347
HOPELESS?
- WAS THAT MY DAUGHTER?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.016
- I APOLOGIZE.
- OH, MY GOD.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.450
WHERE'S TAYLOR?
I WANT TO SEE HER.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.352
- SHE'S HERE.
- OH, SHE'S HERE NOW?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.121
WHERE WAS SHE WHEN EMILY
WAS DISAPPEARING, HUH?

15:54.121 --> 15:56.189
- [crying]
MOM, I'M SO SORRY.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.290
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE, HONEY.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.758
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.427
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.428
IT'S YOUR MOM.
- ARE YOU BLAMING ME?

16:01.428 --> 16:03.030
- YES!
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:03.030 --> 16:04.497
- MR. CULPHERS, LET'S GO.
MY OFFICE.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.466
- MRS. CULPHERS,
I'M DETECTIVE BENSON.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.468
I NEED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT EMILY.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.438
ANY IDENTIFYING MARKS,
MEDICAL CONDITIONS,

16:11.438 --> 16:13.573
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME.
- LET'S, UH...

16:13.573 --> 16:16.643
LET'S GET YOU SOMETHING
TO EAT, HUH?

16:16.643 --> 16:19.179
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
WE CAN.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.513
- THIS DARK NET.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.682
THERE'S NOTHING ANYBODY
CAN DO ABOUT IT?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.684
NOT EVEN THE FEDS?

16:24.684 --> 16:28.455
- WE CAN ASK.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.756
- WHEN HE DRINKS,
HE YELLS.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.025
BUT EMILY LOVES HIM.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.194
- DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL?

16:36.796 --> 16:38.365
- HOW ABOUT TAYLOR?

16:38.365 --> 16:40.467
- [crying] UH...
THEY FIGHT.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.735
YOU KNOW, HE'S STRICT.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.404
BUT KIDS NEED DISCIPLINE,
RIGHT?

16:44.404 --> 16:46.273
- SHE'S TOO SOFT ON THEM.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.408
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LET THEM GO!

16:48.408 --> 16:52.512
- ANY ISSUES
WITH YOUR DAUGHTERS?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.581
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.049
THIS IS ON ME?

16:56.049 --> 16:57.417
I GOT A TEMPER--
THIS IS MY FAULT?

16:57.417 --> 17:00.520
- NO, NO--
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.689
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT EMILY?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.125
SHE SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD GIRL.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.294
- SHE IS.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.562
SHE'S PERFECT.

17:11.464 --> 17:16.503
SHE ALWAYS DOES
WHAT SHE'S TOLD, YOU KNOW?

17:16.503 --> 17:18.705
HEY, I DON'T NEED
A THERAPY SESSION FROM YOU.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.373
OKAY?
I JUST NEED TO KNOW--

17:20.373 --> 17:22.542
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO FIND MY DAUGHTER?

17:29.482 --> 17:31.551
- GOOD GOD.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.730
- THOUGHT WE HAD A HARD JOB.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.665
- DETECTIVES,
I TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE,

17:45.665 --> 17:47.434
THE DARK NET
IS A BLACK HOLE.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.601
- DID YOU EVEN LOOK
AT THE SITE?

17:48.601 --> 17:51.571
- THERE'S NOT MUCH
TO GO ON.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.573
I SEARCH THESE VIDEOS
FOR CLUES

17:53.573 --> 17:55.142
UNTIL MY EYES BLEED.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.709
GET SOME LUMINOL.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.412
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE GUY
I REPLACED PUNCHED HIS TICKET.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.414
- A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL
IS MISSING.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.650
- AND I'VE GOT
THOUSANDS MISSING.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.718
YOUR GIRL'S TOO CLOSE
TO LOOKING LEGAL.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.554
HARD TO PROSECUTE
THOSE CASES.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.457
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
WALK AWAY FROM THIS JOB.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.392
- [scoffs]

18:12.392 --> 18:14.194
BOY IN DIAPERS?

18:14.194 --> 18:18.431
GOT 37,000 COMMENTS
IN TWO DAYS.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.899
WE'RE PLAYING WHACK-A-MOLE.

18:19.899 --> 18:23.470
WE KNOCK DOWN ONE SIDE,
AND ANOTHER ONE POPS UP.

18:23.470 --> 18:27.207
- THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.475
- DETECTIVES,

18:28.475 --> 18:30.810
A LONG SHOT--

18:30.810 --> 18:32.412
THERE'S A HACKER
WE JUST NAILED.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.814
HE TOOK DOWN SOME DARK NET
KIDDIE PORN SITES.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.616
- AND HE GOT ARRESTED
FOR THAT?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.185
- OH, NO, UH...

18:38.185 --> 18:40.153
THEY PUT HIM AWAY
FOR TAKING DOWN NYC.GOV

18:40.153 --> 18:41.388
AND THE YANKEES' WEBSITE.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.156
- THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN
THE GUY A MEDAL.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.724
- THE D.A.
WAS A YANKEES FAN.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.493
HACKER'S NAME IS JOB.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.227
HE'S AT RIKERS,

18:47.227 --> 18:49.796
ABOUT TO BE TRANSFERRED
UPSTATE.

18:49.796 --> 18:54.567
- THANKS.
[phone vibrating]

18:54.567 --> 18:58.438
KIM.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.739
UH...OKAY.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.275
STAY THERE.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.643
THAT WAS MY SISTER.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.445
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO HOME
FOR A MINUTE.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.746
- DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.918
- KIM.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.886
- MANDY, YOU CAME HOME.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.888
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:15.888 --> 19:17.424
YOU...OUT.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.694
OUT!
GO.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.263
- HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.531
THAT'S MY NEW FRIEND.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.966
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TREAT HIM
THAT WAY.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.501
YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.437
- YOU'RE BRINGING STRANGERS
INTO MY HOUSE?

19:30.437 --> 19:32.272
- HE WASN'T A STRANGER.
HE WAS A REALLY NICE GUY.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.207
HE ACTUALLY HOOKED ME UP.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.742
- YOU CALL ME FOR MONEY?

19:35.742 --> 19:40.213
- I FOUND IT IN YOUR FREEZER,
LIKE HOME.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.216
[scoffs] YOU JUST WASHED
200 BUCKS DOWN THE DRAIN.

19:43.216 --> 19:46.386
- I CAN'T HAVE THIS HERE.
I AM A DETECTIVE.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.522
- OH, RIGHT,
BUT GAMBLING'S FINE, RIGHT?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.858
- ACTUALLY,
I'M DONE WITH THAT.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.226
IN FACT, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO COME WITH ME

19:53.226 --> 19:54.394
TO A MEETING,
I THINK THAT--

19:54.394 --> 19:56.263
- ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I WOULD LOVE?

19:56.263 --> 19:58.831
I WAS THINKING MAYBE I
COULD COME FOLLOW YOU AROUND.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.968
YOU KNOW, LEARN THE JOB
A LITTLE BIT.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.837
I MEAN, I WANTED TO BE
A COP FIRST.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.606
YOU TOOK THAT FROM ME.

20:11.478 --> 20:15.448
- OKAY.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.517
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU ATE?

20:17.517 --> 20:19.519
- YOU GOT NO FOOD
IN THIS HOUSE.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.821
- HOW ABOUT I ORDER
DELIVERY PIZZA?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.456
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.792
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

20:29.429 --> 20:33.400
- SO...THIS HOST,
LFOD--IT'S A CLEARINGHOUSE.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.902
IT'S LIKE, UH, DRUDGE
FOR THE DARK NET.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.037
LOTS OF GUYS POST THROUGH IT--
CHINESE DISSIDENTS,

20:38.037 --> 20:40.540
SYRIAN REBELS,
TRAFFICKERS.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.008
KIDDIE PORN SUPPLIERS.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.943
- THIS IS THE HACKER
FROM RIKERS?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.479
- HE DID TAKE DOWN
TWO KIDDIE PORN RINGS.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.981
- SO WE'RE HOPING PETER
WILL TAKE HIS BAIT?

20:48.981 --> 20:50.517
- IT'S TWO STEPS TO PETER.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.285
FIRST, WE HAVE TO GET
INTO THE SITE

20:52.285 --> 20:53.486
THAT HOSTS HIS VIDEOS.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.789
IT'S BASICALLY
A DIGITAL TROJAN HORSE.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.426
- SOME DAYS,
I MISS KNOCKING ON DOORS.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.594
- OH, YEAH,
WE GOT HIM.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.896
- LOOKS LIKE
THEY GOT SOMETHING.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.432
- LINK FREE OR DIE
TOOK THE BAIT.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.833
WE'RE ON HIS TAIL.
- WE GOT A HIT.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.969
- IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.639
- DON'T WORRY,
IT'LL FIND A HOME SOON.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.607
- CZECH REPUBLIC,
NETHERLANDS, RIO.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.476
- WE COULD CALL INTERPOL.
- WHY?

21:16.476 --> 21:17.777
MY MALWARE'S ON HIS SITE.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.512
I CAN SHUT HIM DOWN
RIGHT NOW.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.947
- NO, DON'T DO THAT.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.316
THIS IS OUR ONLY CONNECTION
TO THE KIDNAPPER.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.751
- CAN YOU SEARCH THIS SITE?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.353
- SURE, ANY USER CAN SEARCH.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.754
I CAN FIND TIME CODES,
HIT RATES.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.656
DOWNLOAD DATES.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.425
I CAN TRACK THE USERS
USING MY VIRUS.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.060
- OKAY, SO CHECK EVERY FILE
THAT PETER SENT

21:34.060 --> 21:36.829
TO LINK FREE OR DIE,
RECENT VIDEO FILES FIRST.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.665
- I'M ON IT.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.368
NOW ENTERING LOLITAVILLE.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.735
- OH, THERE'S ONE.
IS THAT A NEW POST?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.638
- YEAH.
IT'S "EMILY, PART TWO."

21:45.638 --> 21:48.375
STREAMING LIVE.
2,000 VIEWERS.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.518
- OUR LITTLE PRINCESS.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.555
ALL CLEAN AND READY
TO TAKE REQUESTS.

22:02.555 --> 22:06.893
RIGHT, EMILY?

22:06.893 --> 22:10.530
LET ME BRUSH YOUR HAIR.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.533
IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR THE SHOW.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.968
WOW, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.671
AND YOU HAVE
SO MANY FANS THAT WANT

22:18.671 --> 22:21.007
TO SEE YOU IN ACTION,
EMILY.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.047
- OUR HACKER FOUND UPLOADS FROM
PETER GOING BACK FIVE YEARS.

22:28.047 --> 22:31.684
EVERY YEAR, A NEW GIRL.
FIVE LOLITAVILLE VIDEOS.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.053
EMILY MAKES SIX.
- SAME SCENARIO EVERY TIME?

22:34.053 --> 22:36.656
- AT FIRST, HE STARTS
IN THE BEDROOM,

22:36.656 --> 22:38.124
THEN TO THE BATH,
AND THEN...

22:38.124 --> 22:40.593
IT DEPENDS
ON AUDIENCE REQUESTS.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.429
- AND THE LAST VIDEO
WE HAVE OF EMILY,

22:42.429 --> 22:44.631
HE INVITED HIS AUDIENCE
TO SUBMIT REQUESTS?

22:44.631 --> 22:46.699
HOW LONG BETWEEN POSTS?

22:46.699 --> 22:49.936
- SOMETIMES A FEW DAYS,
AND SOMETIMES MORE.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.772
- NO SENSE OF PLACE OR TIME,
OUTSIDE SOUNDS...

22:52.772 --> 22:54.574
- IT'S A WINDOWLESS ROOM.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.577
THE CLOTHES, THE TOYS,
BEDSPREADS, FURNITURE.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.712
THEY'RE ALL GENERIC.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.114
- ALL WE HAVE ARE THE GIRLS.
- YEAH.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.484
- ODDS ARE,
WHEN HE'S THROUGH...

23:04.484 --> 23:07.019
THEY GO INTO DRUGS
OR PROSTITUTION.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.721
THEY'RE PROBABLY
IN THE SYSTEM.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.722
I'LL ISSUE WARRANTS.
- WARRANTS FOR WHAT?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.923
THEY'RE ALL VICTIMS.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.124
- YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.594
WE'VE GOT TO GET EMILY.
FAST.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.596
THESE OTHER GIRLS,
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THEM.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.036
- BETH MARKS,
A.K.A. MISTY DAY.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.672
THE GIRL'S GONE PRO.

23:25.672 --> 23:26.806
- YEAH, WELL,
AFTER PETER TURNED HER OUT,

23:26.806 --> 23:28.174
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.609
- LOOKS LIKE HER
RIGHT THERE.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.177
HEY, MISTY.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.446
- MY SET DOESN'T START
FOR AN HOUR.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.681
- WE'RE NOT FANS.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.450
- WE'RE NOT HERE AS FANS.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.086
FIVE YEARS AGO, YOUR FAMILY
REPORTED YOU MISSING.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.521
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.522
- NEED YOUR HELP.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.790
PETER HAS ANOTHER GIRL.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.525
- SAVE YOUR BREATH.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.727
WE'RE ALL FORCED TO DO THINGS
TO SURVIVE.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.730
I MOVED ON.
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

23:50.730 --> 23:51.798
- WORSE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.199
TRUST ME.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.634
AT LEAST
I WAS TAKEN CARE OF.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.636
- HONEY...

23:56.636 --> 23:58.204
HE WASN'T TAKING CARE
OF YOU.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.639
- PETER? NO.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.708
PETER TAKES CARE OF PETER.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.976
I MEANT WENDI.

24:03.976 --> 24:07.480
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT WENDI?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.582
- SHE'LL TELL YOU
THE SAME THING I AM.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.683
SHE HAD IT WORSE.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.018
SHE'D RUN AWAY.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.620
PETER SAVED HER
FROM THE STREET.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.854
- SAY WHERE SHE WAS FROM?

24:14.854 --> 24:16.789
- SOMEWHERE OUT WEST.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.559
LIKE THE U.P.
OR SOMETHING.

24:19.559 --> 24:20.693
- YOU KNOW WHAT, BETH?

24:20.693 --> 24:23.563
WHEN WE CATCH THIS GUY--
- YOU WON'T.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.765
AND I GO BY MISTY NOW.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.738
- THAT'S LIZA.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.205
SHE WASN'T KIDNAPPED.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.676
SHE RAN AWAY.
CAME BACK WITH SOME WILD STORY.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.178
- SHE EVER MENTION BEING FORCED
TO MAKE INTERNET MOVIES?

24:39.178 --> 24:40.780
- I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I TOLD HER.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.282
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.952
- WELL, IT TURNS OUT
IT MIGHT BE TRUE.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.955
- WHY WE TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

24:48.955 --> 24:50.790
SHE'S GONE.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.927
SHE O.D.'D
THREE MONTHS AGO.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.063
- I'M SO SORRY.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.264
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:58.264 --> 24:59.766
- SHE STRAIGHTENED
HERSELF OUT.

24:59.766 --> 25:03.035
SHE GOT A JOB.
SHE--SHE STARTED USING AGAIN.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.871
CLAIMS BECAUSE SHE RAN
INTO THIS GIRL.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.038
IT GOT HER ALL UPSET.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.106
- WAIT, THIS GIRL--

25:07.106 --> 25:08.608
LIZA SAY HER NAME?

25:08.608 --> 25:10.276
- WENDI.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.746
SHE STARTED IN
WITH THESE KIDNAPPING STORIES.

25:13.746 --> 25:17.283
I THOUGHT SHE WAS MAKING
EXCUSES FOR USING.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.822
SO SHE WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH.

25:25.257 --> 25:28.094
[camera clicking]

25:28.094 --> 25:30.797
- KATRINE KEARNS?

25:30.797 --> 25:33.966
- DETECTIVES?
UH, THIS IS A PHOTO SHOOT

25:33.966 --> 25:35.802
FOR NORWEGIAN APPAREL.

25:35.802 --> 25:36.903
WE GOT OUR PERMITS.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.270
- WE JUST ACTUALLY WANTED

25:38.270 --> 25:39.639
TO TALK TO YOUR PHOTOGRAPHER
PRIVATELY.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.707
KATRINE, DO YOU MIND?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.174
- SORRY. CAN'T.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.644
I'M KATRINE'S HUSBAND
AND HER LAWYER.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.679
SHE'S SHY.
I'M NOT.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.314
TWINS, TAKE FIVE.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.950
- WE WANTED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.285
WENDI AND PETER?

25:53.285 --> 25:54.821
- YEAH,
KATRINE TELLS ME EVERYTHING.

25:54.821 --> 25:55.922
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.590
UGH. THOSE BASTARDS.

25:57.590 --> 26:01.728
AFTER THEY WERE THROUGH
DEFILING HER,

26:01.728 --> 26:02.695
THEY TRIED TO SELL HER.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.997
- WHY DON'T YOU
LET HER TELL IT?

26:08.167 --> 26:12.204
- PETER...GAVE ME
TO THIS GUY.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.306
A BROKER.
HE--

26:14.306 --> 26:16.142
- HE TRIED
TO TURN HER OUT,

26:16.142 --> 26:19.812
BUT I SAVED HER
FROM THAT LIFE.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.014
SO IF THAT'S ALL YOU NEED,
WE HAVE A CLOTHING LINE TO PUSH.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.616
- IF YOU'RE SELLING CLOTHES,

26:23.616 --> 26:25.685
HOW COME THE TWINS
BARELY HAVE ANY ON?

26:25.685 --> 26:27.854
- VERY FUNNY.
HOW ARE MY GIRLS?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.255
- GOOD.
- WE'RE GOOD.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.291
- MY HUSBAND DID...
SAVE ME, YOU KNOW.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.927
I HAVE A CAREER NOW.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.197
I DO PRIVATE PHOTOS.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.000
FAMILY PORTRAITS.
DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.069
NIECES?
NEPHEWS?

26:43.069 --> 26:46.138
- NOT YET, NO.
THANK YOU.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.742
- HOW MUCH YOU THINK
HE PAID HIS BROKER FOR HER?

26:49.742 --> 26:51.778
SHE'S HIS SLAVE.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.847
- MAYBE NOT.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.116
- "WENDI,
MARQUETTE, MICHIGAN."

26:59.185 --> 27:00.987
- KATRINE'S TIP PAID OFF.

27:00.987 --> 27:04.390
WE FOUND ONE MISSING GIRL--
JANE KALREISS FROM MARQUETTE.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.693
HER FAMILY'S
STILL SEARCHING FOR HER.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.994
- THIS COULD BE OUR WENDI.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.429
- WENDI WENT FROM VIC
TO PROCURER.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.064
- ANYTHING
TO MAKE PETER HAPPY.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.400
- TAYLOR'S STILL HERE, RIGHT?
BRING HER OVER.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.903
- OKAY, SO, GUYS,
I TOOK JANE'S PHOTO,

27:16.903 --> 27:20.239
AND I USED AGE PROGRESSION
SOFTWARE.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.708
I GOT THIS.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.776
ALL RIGHT,
I PUT PIC

27:23.776 --> 27:25.011
INTO EVERY DATABASE
I COULD THINK OF.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.079
NCIC, DMV.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.248
THESE ARE THE POSSIBILITIES
WE CAME UP WITH.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.783
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:30.783 --> 27:33.119
- TAYLOR...WE NEED YOU
TO TAKE A LOOK

27:33.119 --> 27:34.854
AT SOME PHOTOS.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.857
NOW, DO YOU
RECOGNIZE ANYONE?

27:37.857 --> 27:40.326
- YEAH.
THAT'S HER.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.427
- THIS ONE?

27:41.427 --> 27:42.995
- YEAH, THAT'S WENDI.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.264
DIFFERENT HAIR COLOR,
BUT THAT'S HER.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.466
- THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL, TAYLOR.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.468
YOU CAN TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD
THAT WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE,

27:49.468 --> 27:51.003
OKAY?

27:51.003 --> 27:54.273
- OKAY.
LOOK, JERSEY LICENSE.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.909
TWO-YEAR-OLD NISSAN
REGISTERED TO WENDI BAKER.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.778
- RUN THE PLATES

27:58.778 --> 27:59.478
THROUGH NATIONAL VEHICLE
LOCATION SYSTEM.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.813
FIND HER.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.348
- SO WHAT'S OUR PLAY?

28:02.348 --> 28:04.483
- WE BRING HER IN,
IT'LL SCARE PETER OFF.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.152
- WE MAKE HER
OUR TROJAN HORSE.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.020
SPOOK HER A BIT,
HOPE SHE LEADS US

28:08.020 --> 28:09.421
BACK TO PETER
AND EMILY.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.825
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS,
CALL FOR YOU.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.431
- SEE, I TOLD YOU
SHE'D COME.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.300
YOU MESSED
WITH THE WRONG FAMILY.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.335
WHAT'D I EVEN DO?
I WAS JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.337
- KIM, SHUT UP.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.739
I'M SORRY, OFFICER.

28:26.739 --> 28:27.907
- SHE HAD AN OPEN CONTAINER,
DETECTIVE.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.842
- OKAY.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.911
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT WON'T.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.880
SHE BUSTED YOU.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.981
[giggling]

28:34.981 --> 28:36.448
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO SABOTAGE ME?

28:36.448 --> 28:38.017
- NO.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.318
I DIDN'T COME
ALL THE WAY UP HERE

28:39.318 --> 28:40.920
TO SIT ALONE
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.388
- GET IN.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.823
- WILL YOU AT LEAST
TAKE THE CUFFS OFF?

28:43.823 --> 28:46.859
- DON'T PUSH IT, KIM.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.869
- THIS HAS GOTTA BE HER.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.372
- JANE KALREISS?
- NYPD.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.473
YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

29:01.473 --> 29:03.776
- NOT REALLY.
- NORWEGIAN APPAREL.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.912
THAT'S A TEEN BRAND.
THOSE FOR YOU?

29:05.912 --> 29:06.979
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:06.979 --> 29:09.248
- THIS GIRL...

29:09.248 --> 29:11.517
SHE WENT MISSING
FROM A MIDTOWN HOTEL.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.252
- WHAT'S SHE GOT
TO DO WITH ME?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.854
- YOU SPOKE TO HER.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.156
WE TRACKED YOU FROM
THE HOTEL SECURITY CAMERAS.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.424
- I TALK
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.859
- LOOK, WE COULD
REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.394
THIS GIRL'S SISTER
REMEMBERS NOTHING.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.831
DID YOU SEE THEM LEAVE
WITH ANYONE?

29:25.564 --> 29:27.399
- SORRY.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.568
- LOOK, IF YOU THINK
OF ANYTHING,

29:29.568 --> 29:31.904
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.472
WILL YOU CALL ME?

29:33.472 --> 29:35.207
- NOW, LET'S MAKE IT EASY.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.409
JUST CALL DETECTIVE BENSON
RIGHT NOW,

29:37.409 --> 29:39.278
SO WE HAVE YOUR NUMBER.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.113
IT'S A MISSING GIRL
FROM OUT OF TOWN.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.548
WE GOTTA GO BY THE BOOK.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.487
[typing]

29:48.487 --> 29:50.857
- YOU GOT THE WIRETAP WARRANT
THAT FAST?

29:50.857 --> 29:53.059
- I'M QUICK.
WE LIVE YET?

29:56.028 --> 29:58.931
- PETER? PETER.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.266
- SOMETHING WRONG, WENDI?

30:00.266 --> 30:02.601
- JUST, UH,
HITTING SOME TRAFFIC.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.270
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE DOG TO THE VET?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.939
- THE SOUTH SHORE,
STATEN ISLAND.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.440
[sighs]

30:08.440 --> 30:10.509
PHONE POWERED DOWN.
WE LOST IT.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.278
- TELL BENSON AND AMARO
NOT TO LOSE WENDI.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.579
SHE'S OUR ONLY LINK
TO PETER NOW.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.566
- CALL IT IN.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.468
POLICE!
DON'T MOVE.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.505
JANE KALREISS...

30:39.505 --> 30:42.508
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.511
- HEY, HEY.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.014
- DON'T WORRY, EMILY.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.648
YOU'LL BE FINE.

30:49.648 --> 30:53.185
THEY WON'T GET YOU.
I WON'T LET THEM.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.486
OKAY?

30:59.491 --> 31:02.161
[stairs creaking]

31:20.512 --> 31:22.614
- EMILY?

31:36.662 --> 31:38.497
AH, THEY'RE GONE.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.600
WE'RE TOO LATE.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.669
- CAREFUL, DETECTIVE.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.550
WE'RE LIVE.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.728
- GO AHEAD,
ASK ME A QUESTION.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.163
ANYTHING.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.965
- [whispering]
HE CAN'T SEE ME.

32:12.965 --> 32:16.302
KEEP HIM TALKING.
I'LL GO.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.637
- UM...WHERE ARE YOU?

32:18.637 --> 32:20.472
- AH...
[chuckles]

32:20.472 --> 32:22.041
I'M GLAD YOU HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.476
- LOOK, ALL WE WANT
IS THE GIRL.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.512
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
EMILY?

32:26.512 --> 32:29.081
- GO AHEAD,
TELL HIM.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.349
- [voice shaky]
I'M OKAY.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.751
- I HAVEN'T HURT YOU,
RIGHT?

32:32.751 --> 32:35.087
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HE HASN'T HURT ME.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.260
- WE MISS 'EM?

32:41.260 --> 32:42.728
- OR THEY WERE NEVER HERE.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.064
LOOK, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT THIS IS A DECOY HOUSE.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.033
PETER'S WITH EMILY
ON A LIVE VIDEO FEED,

32:47.033 --> 32:48.567
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.002
AMARO'S KEEPING HIM
TALKING.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.003
- SO THEY COULD BE
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.738
- WELL, MAYBE NOT.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.740
ALL OF THE OTHER VICTIMS
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO WENDI.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.009
SHE'S VALUABLE TO PETER.
HE KEEPS HER CLOSE.

32:57.009 --> 32:59.178
- I'LL CALL TARU, SEE IF THEY
CAN TRACE A VIDEO FEED.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.512
- YOU THINK
WE CAN GET WENDI--

33:00.512 --> 33:04.050
UH, JANE TO TALK?

33:04.050 --> 33:05.184
- [sighs]
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.518
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

33:06.518 --> 33:10.356
I MEAN,
SHE'S FUSED WITH PETER.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.092
- WELL, LET'S JUST HOPE THERE'S
SOMETHING LEFT OF JANE.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.795
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.765
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO KEEP ME CUFFED?

33:19.765 --> 33:22.068
- I THINK
YOU'VE BEEN HURT ENOUGH.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.535
- BY WHO? PETER?

33:23.535 --> 33:24.770
[chuckling]

33:24.770 --> 33:28.674
IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK HAPPENED?

33:28.674 --> 33:31.077
HE DIDN'T HURT ME.
HE SAVED ME.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.744
- HE SAVING EMILY NOW?

33:32.744 --> 33:33.812
- YEAH.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.147
SHE'S BETTER OFF HERE.

33:35.147 --> 33:39.451
- IN THIS ROOM
THAT HE KEPT YOU IN?

33:39.451 --> 33:41.120
THAT BED
THAT HE RAPED YOU IN?

33:41.120 --> 33:43.089
- WASN'T LIKE THAT.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.157
- YOU'RE SCARING
MY EMILY.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.792
- YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

33:46.792 --> 33:48.827
I JUST WANT HER SAFE.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.630
- SAFE? WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT I RESCUED HER?

33:51.630 --> 33:53.299
SHE'S 14 YEARS OLD,

33:53.299 --> 33:55.501
SHE'S AT A FRAT PARTY AT NIGHT
IN NEW YORK CITY?

33:55.501 --> 33:56.768
- YEAH, I HEAR THAT.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.137
- WE SAW THE VIDEOS, JANE.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.638
[cuffs crank shut]

33:59.638 --> 34:02.141
YOU WERE JUST
A LITTLE GIRL.

34:02.141 --> 34:05.811
- IT'S WENDI.
- HE FORCED YOU.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.779
YOU AND ALL THOSE OTHER
LITTLE GIRLS.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.448
LIZA, KATRINE.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.117
- HE WAS TRYING
TO SAVE THEM TOO.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.818
LIZA USED DRUGS.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.787
KATRINE HAD NO ONE.

34:15.787 --> 34:20.859
PETER SAYS OUR SOCIETY
TREATS GIRLS LIKE OBJECTS.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.461
THEY'RE DISPOSABLE.

34:22.461 --> 34:24.596
- LIKE LIZA WAS.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.532
SHE O.D.'D.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.167
YOU KNOW,
SHE STARTED USING

34:28.167 --> 34:31.137
RIGHT AFTER
SHE RAN INTO YOU.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.106
- [scoffs]

34:34.106 --> 34:36.675
SHE WAS A TRAIN WRECK
ANYWAY.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.410
HER FAMILY DIDN'T CARE.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.746
NONE OF THESE GIRLS
HAD ANYONE WHO MISSED THEM.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.314
- EMILY'S FAMILY CARES.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.683
HER MOM AND DAD ARE GOING
OUT OF THEIR MINDS.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.318
- THEY'LL FORGET
ABOUT HER.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.187
- THEY HAVEN'T LEFT
THE SQUAD ROOM ALL NIGHT.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.256
THEY'RE DESPERATE,
JUST LIKE YOUR FAMILY WAS.

34:50.256 --> 34:53.225
- MY FAMILY DIDN'T EVEN
REPORT ME MISSING.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.093
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
- PETER DID.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.266
HE SAID NO ONE
CARES ABOUT ME.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.334
NO ONE LOVES ME
BUT HIM.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.870
- WE HAVE
THE MISSING PERSONS FLYERS

35:04.870 --> 35:06.372
THAT YOUR PARENTS MADE.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.739
- [scoffs]
YOU'RE LYING.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.342
- JANE,
THAT'S HOW WE FOUND YOU.

35:10.342 --> 35:11.843
- PETER GAVE ME CLOTHES.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.579
PETER FED ME.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.381
WHEN I GOT TOO OLD,

35:15.381 --> 35:17.516
HE LET ME STAY.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.884
[door closes]

35:18.884 --> 35:21.420
LAST YEAR,
WE WENT ON A CRUISE.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.921
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

35:22.921 --> 35:27.193
YOUR FAMILY
NEVER STOPPED LOOKING FOR YOU.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.797
EVER.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.768
- WHAT KIND OF PARENTS

35:36.768 --> 35:37.903
SEND THEIR CHILD TO NEW YORK
WITHOUT THEM?

35:37.903 --> 35:39.638
- I KNOW, BUT IF IT
WEREN'T FOR YOU,

35:39.638 --> 35:40.772
WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED TO HER?

35:40.772 --> 35:42.341
- OH,
YOU'RE GONNA MOCK ME NOW?

35:42.341 --> 35:43.675
LISTEN,
I'LL TURN THIS OFF RIGHT NOW.

35:43.675 --> 35:44.810
- HEY, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T DO THAT.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.812
- [chuckles]

35:46.812 --> 35:48.914
[sighs]

35:48.914 --> 35:51.650
I NEVER HURT MY GIRLS.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.819
EVEN ON REQUEST NIGHT.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.322
YOU SHOULD HEAR SOME OF
THE THINGS THESE SICKOS ASK FOR.

35:56.322 --> 36:00.359
I'M GENTLE!

36:00.359 --> 36:02.528
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
TELL HIM.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.832
- [quietly]
HE'S GENTLE.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.568
- YEAH, I-I KNOW.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.636
HEY, PETER, YOU'RE--

36:10.636 --> 36:11.970
YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.972
- I CAN'T IMAGINE...

36:13.972 --> 36:17.509
WHAT THAT
MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.678
AND HOW SCARY THAT MUST
HAVE BEEN, BEING ALL ALONE,

36:19.678 --> 36:22.481
NEVER KNOWING
WHAT'S GOING TO COME NEXT.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.782
- I KNEW
HE'D ALWAYS COME BACK.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.951
- TO DO WHAT, JANE?

36:25.951 --> 36:28.787
TO MAKE YOU PERFORM
FOR THE CAMERAS?

36:28.787 --> 36:33.359
TO TAKE REQUESTS?

36:33.359 --> 36:34.660
- YOU GET USED TO THAT PART.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.928
- HONEY...EVEN THE PART

36:36.928 --> 36:39.798
WITH ALL THE OTHER MEN?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.903
- JANE.
- OH, DON'T CALL ME THAT.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.440
- SOMEONE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

36:52.844 --> 36:56.348
- [crying]
JANE!

36:56.348 --> 36:58.584
OH, MY GOD!

36:58.584 --> 37:01.019
- MOM?

37:01.019 --> 37:02.488
- OH, MY--

37:02.488 --> 37:03.989
- THEY NEVER STOPPED
LOOKING FOR YOU.

37:03.989 --> 37:04.990
- JANE, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.658
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.528
JUST COME HOME TO US.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.997
[crying]

37:11.997 --> 37:13.965
- OHH! IT IS YOU.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.935
[crying]
- ASHLEY.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.671
- SEE, THEY ANSWERED
AS SOON AS I CALLED.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.907
- [sniffles]
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.842
[tearful laugh]

37:23.842 --> 37:25.777
- SO ARE YOU.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.279
[baby crying]

37:27.279 --> 37:29.381
THAT'S YOUR NIECE.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.916
I NAMED HER JANEY.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.384
[baby crying]

37:32.384 --> 37:34.386
- JANE...

37:34.386 --> 37:35.587
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.290
IT'S OKAY.
TALK TO THEM.

37:38.290 --> 37:39.991
COME ON.
TALK TO 'EM.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.633
- WHERE'S DAD?

37:48.967 --> 37:51.603
- HE DIDN'T MAKE IT, JANE.

37:51.603 --> 37:55.841
IT WAS SO HARD FOR HIM,
ALL OF US.

37:55.841 --> 38:00.779
HE WENT EVERY TIME
THEY FOUND ANYTHING.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.013
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.918
- JANE...

38:06.918 --> 38:11.022
EMILY'S FAMILY
WANTS HER BACK,

38:11.022 --> 38:13.825
JUST LIKE YOUR FAMILY
WANTS YOU BACK.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.603
- SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE ADDRESS?
- NO, PETER WAS SMART.

38:24.603 --> 38:25.871
HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY RISKS.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.106
HE BLINDFOLDED WENDI
EVERY TIME.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.075
SHE SAID SHE REMEMBERED
IT WAS A HOUSE

38:30.075 --> 38:31.810
WITH NO STEPS
ON THE FRONT DOOR,

38:31.810 --> 38:33.612
AND IT WAS
ON A CURVING ROAD.

38:33.612 --> 38:34.980
- SAID IT WAS
A WHITE HOUSE TOO.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.616
- [scoffs]

38:40.051 --> 38:41.653
- I DON'T WANT MY EMILY
TO END UP

38:41.653 --> 38:44.656
LIKE THOSE GIRLS
ON THE STREET.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.358
DRUGS...

38:46.358 --> 38:48.560
DISEASE.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.563
THAT WON'T HAPPEN TO HER.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.466
YOU DON'T WANT THAT,
DO YOU?

38:54.466 --> 38:57.135
YOU WANT TO STAY RIGHT THERE,
DON'T YOU, SWEET GIRL?

38:57.135 --> 38:58.837
- [crying]

39:03.409 --> 39:05.043
- POLICE! DON'T MOVE!
- LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!

39:05.043 --> 39:06.712
- GET YOUR HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!

39:06.712 --> 39:08.414
MOVE AWAY FROM THE GIRL.
- OKAY, OKAY.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.582
THIS IS ON CAMERA.
I'M UNARMED.

39:10.582 --> 39:11.917
I'M NOT RESISTING.
I HAVE NO BRUISES!

39:11.917 --> 39:13.419
- YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
FOR KIDNAPPING

39:13.419 --> 39:14.786
IN THE FIRST DEGREE...
- COME HERE, DARLING.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.588
- UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT
AND POSSESSION...

39:16.588 --> 39:18.557
- DON'T HURT ME.
THIS IS BEING RECORDED.

39:18.557 --> 39:19.725
[handcuffs snapping]

39:19.725 --> 39:21.092
WE'RE LIVE, RIGHT NOW!

39:21.092 --> 39:22.961
- NOT ANYMORE.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.070
- EMILY!
I AM SO SORRY!

39:32.070 --> 39:35.641
- [sobbing]

39:35.641 --> 39:37.943
- [sobbing]
MY BABIES.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.915
- [crying]
OKAY.

39:51.457 --> 39:54.460
- THANK YOU.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.631
- HOPE SHE GETS THE CHANCE
TO BE A KID AGAIN.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.833
- WE CAN HOPE.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.735
IT'S A GOOD JOB,
ALL OF YOU.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.772
- THANKS, CAP.

40:06.772 --> 40:10.108
- GET HOME SAFE, GUYS.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.077
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU TAKE TOMORROW OFF, NICK?

40:12.077 --> 40:13.612
SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.

40:13.612 --> 40:16.548
THAT'S AN ORDER.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.453
- HOLD UP.

40:21.453 --> 40:26.024
THANKS.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.559
[sighs]

40:29.094 --> 40:30.529
- YOU GOT PLANS
FOR TONIGHT?

40:30.529 --> 40:33.565
- OH, NO, I'M...WIPED.
YOU?

40:33.565 --> 40:35.701
- QUIET NIGHT AT HOME
WITH MY SISTER.

40:35.701 --> 40:39.571
WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD
THE CHANCE TO CATCH UP, SO...

40:39.571 --> 40:41.172
- YEAH, I KNOW.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.174
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON
WITH HER.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.010
THAT CAN'T BE EASY
FOR YOU.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.578
- SHE LIKES
TO START THINGS UP.

40:46.578 --> 40:47.979
KEEPS HER CALM.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.815
[bell dings]
I CAN HANDLE IT, YOU KNOW.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.484
- STILL...

40:52.484 --> 40:53.919
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.458
[door shuts]

41:02.861 --> 41:04.663
- JEFF?

41:04.663 --> 41:05.664
GET OFF OF HER.

41:05.664 --> 41:06.998
- OH, AMANDA.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.266
DON'T YOU EVER THINK
OF KNOCKING?

41:08.266 --> 41:10.636
- YOU--HERE.
YOU'RE LEAVING. NOW.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.237
- WHOA! HONEY...CHILL.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.705
YOUR SISTER INVITED ME.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.707
- YEAH, HE SAID
HE WAS SORRY.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.076
HE'S GONNA TAKE ME
TO CANCUN.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.278
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF MY GIRL.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.113
WHO ELSE CAN SHE COUNT ON,
IF NOT JEFF?

41:22.113 --> 41:24.049
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME
TO SHOOT YOUR ASS

41:24.049 --> 41:25.751
IF YOU'RE NOT OUT
OF MY APARTMENT

41:25.751 --> 41:26.885
IN 30 SECONDS.
- AMANDA!

41:26.885 --> 41:27.886
- WHOA, WHOA!
- WHAT THE HELL?

41:27.886 --> 41:29.555
ALL RIGHT, I-I MISSED HIM.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.222
AND--AND YOU'RE NEVER AROUND,
AND I WAS LONELY.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.758
- WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN BEING BEATEN BLOODY,

41:32.758 --> 41:33.992
ISN'T IT?

41:33.992 --> 41:36.562
13, 12, 11...

41:36.562 --> 41:38.564
- NOW I KNOW
WHERE CRAZY COMES FROM.

41:38.564 --> 41:42.100
- YOU AIN'T SEEN CRAZY.
7, 6...

41:42.100 --> 41:43.969
SHOW UP AGAIN,
NO WARNING!

41:43.969 --> 41:45.236
[door slams]

41:45.236 --> 41:47.573
- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

41:47.573 --> 41:49.040
ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T
ASK FOR YOUR HELP.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.909
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.652
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.023
[sighs]

42:43.161 --> 42:46.164
[wolf howls]
