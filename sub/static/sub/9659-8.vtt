00:01.851 --> 00:03.762
<i>PHIL: Previously
on The Amazing Race,</i>

00:03.910 --> 00:06.269
<i>seven teams race to Tbilisi,
Georgia.</i>

00:06.270 --> 00:09.309
BOTH: Whoo-hoo!
<i>-The Detour caused pain...</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:10.949
Argh!
<i>-..and misery.</i>

00:10.950 --> 00:12.949
It sucks being in last place.

00:12.950 --> 00:18.029
<i>At the Roadblock, Ashley was
a dancing queen, but one stumble...</i>

00:18.030 --> 00:19.469
Is this Rike park?

00:19.470 --> 00:21.349
It's not here?
-Not here?

00:21.350 --> 00:22.509
We came to the wrong park.

00:22.510 --> 00:24.429
<i>..gave Zach and Rachel the win.</i>

00:24.430 --> 00:26.869
Ah! No!
-What?! No!

00:26.870 --> 00:28.269
<i>A frenzied finish...</i>

00:28.270 --> 00:29.549
We have to beat them there.

00:29.550 --> 00:31.909
Go, go, go!
-They're right behind us, oh, my God.

00:31.910 --> 00:34.149
<i>..ended in tears for both teams.</i>

00:34.150 --> 00:38.189
Scott and Blair, I'm so sorry, you
have been eliminated from the race.

00:38.190 --> 00:39.579
Whoo!

00:39.580 --> 00:41.579
<i>Six teams remain.
Who will be eliminated next?</i>

00:41.580 --> 00:43.629
Do you have any kids?
Have you ever, like,

00:43.630 --> 00:45.710
locked them in here for punishment?
(LAUGHS)

01:37.679 --> 01:40.998
We have no idea who got eliminated.

01:40.999 --> 01:43.318
Hey!
-Whoo!

01:43.319 --> 01:45.198
We're in.

01:45.199 --> 01:46.478
Good job, guys.

01:46.479 --> 01:49.598
I won't give you what Blair
told me to give you.

01:49.599 --> 01:51.038
We'll do it in private.

01:51.039 --> 01:53.718
BRODIE: I would've loved for Blair
to still be in the race,

01:53.719 --> 01:56.758
but we've talked about
seeing each other after the race.

01:56.759 --> 01:58.278
We've got to win another trip, so...

01:58.279 --> 02:00.959
Yeah, it would be nice to have
a trip that I could take Blair on.

02:03.559 --> 02:06.758
OK, here we go. "Fly to Dubai!"

02:06.759 --> 02:11.318
Dubai is a city that is growing
out of the sand

02:11.319 --> 02:14.718
so quickly that more than 20%
of the world's cranes

02:14.719 --> 02:18.268
are working day and night
to build it up.

02:18.269 --> 02:21.428
<i>And just outside the city
at this remote Bedouin camp,</i>

02:21.429 --> 02:24.598
<i>is where teams will meet up
with their travelling companion</i>

02:24.599 --> 02:27.828
<i>for this leg of the race -
the Travelocity roaming gnome.</i>

02:27.829 --> 02:29.878
Dubai, I did not see that coming.
-I didn't either.

02:29.879 --> 02:31.238
It's going to be nice and hot.

02:31.239 --> 02:32.519
This place is freezing.

02:33.879 --> 02:36.318
Airport?
-Airport? Tbilisi Airport?

02:36.319 --> 02:38.199
Airport?
(CAR HOOTS)

02:39.239 --> 02:40.398
From the dust.

02:40.399 --> 02:43.548
There are six teams left,
so, every leg here on out

02:43.549 --> 02:45.198
is going to be super,
super difficult.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.398
Every team is extremely competitive
and smart,

02:48.399 --> 02:51.158
so, one little mishap
and you're going home.

02:51.159 --> 02:53.199
Goodbye, Georgia!
-Dubai!

02:57.319 --> 03:00.798
We are headed to Dubai.

03:00.799 --> 03:02.478
All the teams are
on this flight together.

03:02.479 --> 03:04.118
Who knows what we're going
to do in Dubai.

03:04.119 --> 03:05.278
It's going to be a crazy day.

03:05.279 --> 03:08.198
We'll be jet skiing,
jumping out of planes,

03:08.199 --> 03:10.198
a lot of crazy stuff
is going to happen in Dubai.

03:10.199 --> 03:12.398
Whoo!

03:12.399 --> 03:14.838
<i>PHIL: All teams are now
making their way to Dubai,</i>

03:14.839 --> 03:16.759
<i>in the United Arab Emirates.</i>

03:26.319 --> 03:27.718
Let's go.
-Unmarked cars.

03:27.719 --> 03:29.118
Do you see anything?

03:29.119 --> 03:30.878
SUVs, SUVs.

03:30.879 --> 03:33.959
Over here. -That's it.
-Get in the car, babe!

03:35.279 --> 03:37.358
Driving directions.
-Will you read them to me?

03:37.359 --> 03:38.998
Alright, Cole.
-Do we know where we're going?

03:38.999 --> 03:40.638
No, look at the directions, hun.

03:40.639 --> 03:44.078
"Exit the car park and turn left."
Do you hear me?

03:44.079 --> 03:46.598
No, say it again.
-You're really not listening to me?

03:46.599 --> 03:48.679
No panicking in this leg,
we're fine.

03:50.719 --> 03:53.838
I'm so excited about seeing
the Travelocity gnome.

03:53.839 --> 03:55.358
I'm not even kidding.

03:55.359 --> 03:56.558
I want to, like, hug him.

03:56.559 --> 03:58.678
OK, I'm looking for E66.

03:58.679 --> 04:00.758
Yeah, the worst thing we can do
is miss our exit.

04:00.759 --> 04:02.518
There's E66.

04:02.519 --> 04:05.078
Is that E66?
-Yeah.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.638
Oh, God, I should have
gotten off there.

04:06.639 --> 04:08.638
Dammit.
-Oh, there goes Sheri.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.638
I think they might have
missed their turn.

04:10.639 --> 04:12.118
Dammit!

04:12.119 --> 04:13.958
Love Sheri and Cole to death,

04:13.959 --> 04:16.598
but Lord knows they're a little
confused on the highway right now.

04:16.599 --> 04:20.517
They have one highway in their
hometown and it's got one lane.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.918
This might have just done us.

04:21.918 --> 04:23.838
Oh, Mom, you're such
a negative person.

04:23.839 --> 04:25.799
We'll figure it out,
it's still early on.

04:29.239 --> 04:34.718
We're looking for race flags to get
our traditional blessing. -Bedouin.

04:34.719 --> 04:38.998
What have you <i>bedouin</i> ?
What HAVE you <i>bedouin</i> ?

04:38.999 --> 04:41.078
I've been driving,
what have you <i>bedouin</i> ?

04:41.079 --> 04:43.358
I've <i>bedouin</i> the navigatin'.

04:43.359 --> 04:45.998
Oh, look at this.
-Oh, wow.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.198
Wow, that is so cool.

04:48.199 --> 04:49.398
Look at the camels, Rach.

04:49.399 --> 04:51.598
Are they literally,
like, roaming free?

04:51.599 --> 04:55.308
They're just everywhere,
there's no-one even guiding them.

04:55.309 --> 04:58.158
There's the old red and yellow flag.
-Go there. Park  here, yeah.

04:58.159 --> 04:59.798
Let's go.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.998
Oh, girl, sand.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.038
Oh, wow.

05:02.039 --> 05:03.478
Holy, crap.

05:03.479 --> 05:04.878
Ty, it's this way.

05:04.879 --> 05:06.239
Whoa.

05:08.119 --> 05:10.308
Here we go, here we go.

05:10.309 --> 05:12.998
Hello.
-Nose, nose.

05:12.999 --> 05:14.518
TYLER: The Bedouin greeting
was, like,

05:14.519 --> 05:16.188
getting real close
and touching noses

05:16.189 --> 05:19.558
and your eyes are wide open,
which was a little bit, like...

05:19.559 --> 05:21.158
Thank you so much.

05:21.159 --> 05:23.158
Thank you.
-Travelocity gnome. OK.

05:23.159 --> 05:24.878
It's a Detour, 'Oasis' or 'Races'.

05:24.879 --> 05:27.838
(SCREAMING)

05:27.839 --> 05:31.158
Camel racing is a traditional sport
<i>with an ancient history</i>

05:31.159 --> 05:32.918
<i>in the Bedouin culture.</i>

05:32.919 --> 05:35.638
<i>Today, teams are going to go
head-to-head on a bicycle</i>

05:35.639 --> 05:37.118
against a racing camel

05:37.119 --> 05:40.358
<i>that can reach speeds
of 40 miles per hour.</i>

05:40.359 --> 05:41.638
<i>Pedalling in the extreme heat,</i>

05:41.639 --> 05:43.718
<i>both team members must cross
the finish line</i>

05:43.719 --> 05:45.838
<i>before the camels
to win their next clue,</i>

05:45.839 --> 05:48.838
<i>if not, they'll get a head start
on their second try.</i>

05:48.839 --> 05:53.358
Camels have been a mainstay of
the Bedouins' nomadic lifestyle

05:53.359 --> 05:54.758
for centuries.

05:54.759 --> 05:57.798
<i>These ships of the desert provide
transportation</i>

05:57.799 --> 06:01.438
<i>and life-enriching camel milk -
a staple of the Bedouin diet.</i>

06:01.439 --> 06:06.278
<i>Teams must walk across the open
desert</i> as they lead four camels

06:06.279 --> 06:10.078
about <i>one mile to a Bedouin camp
for their daily exercise</i>

06:10.079 --> 06:11.278
<i>and the next clue.</i>

06:11.279 --> 06:13.078
Let's go.
-We're going to race.

06:13.079 --> 06:15.918
Oh, there's the gnome.

06:15.919 --> 06:17.238
Thank you, very much. My gnome.

06:17.239 --> 06:18.998
Hey, buddy, let's go.

06:18.999 --> 06:20.238
Camels, like, are stubborn.

06:20.239 --> 06:22.278
OK, I'm not good at riding bikes.
Let's do 'Races'.

06:22.279 --> 06:24.198
What do you think, gnome?
-We do bike?

06:24.199 --> 06:25.678
Alright, we're choosing 'Races'.

06:25.679 --> 06:27.478
Don't go too fast, slow down,
Brodie, slow down.

06:27.479 --> 06:29.118
Dude, relax.

06:29.119 --> 06:31.398
The worst backseat driver
of all time.

06:31.399 --> 06:33.398
Let's get out of here.
Another team just got here.

06:33.399 --> 06:36.038
That's Brodie. He just pulled in.
Dancers.

06:36.039 --> 06:38.358
Continue on foot
to the Bedouin camp.

06:38.359 --> 06:40.278
So the only ones we didn't see were
Sheri and Cole.

06:40.279 --> 06:42.678
I think Cole and Sheri
are lost somewhere.

06:42.679 --> 06:45.398
We're going to Al Ain
and then towards Hatta.

06:45.399 --> 06:47.478
OK, so, now what, now what?

06:47.479 --> 06:50.318
E66. You see the very left?
-Okay. Yes.

06:50.319 --> 06:53.318
Alright, we're back, boom!
-(LAUGHS)

06:53.319 --> 06:55.078
It's OK.

06:55.079 --> 06:56.958
Hello, how are you?
-Nose, nose.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.158
Thank you. This is nice.

07:00.159 --> 07:02.518
Thank you.
-Thank you.

07:02.519 --> 07:03.758
Let's go.

07:03.759 --> 07:04.918
We're riding bikes.
-Riding bikes.

07:04.919 --> 07:06.918
And this. Thank you.

07:06.919 --> 07:09.398
Let's go. Let's do 'Oasis'.

07:09.399 --> 07:11.238
(ENGINE REVS)

07:11.239 --> 07:12.998
Come on, Kurt.
-Oh, my God, no.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.638
Back up and go forward, back up.

07:14.639 --> 07:16.078
Let's go, fast.

07:16.079 --> 07:17.918
Alright. Let me push.

07:17.919 --> 07:19.558
Go!

07:19.559 --> 07:21.118
Go!

07:21.119 --> 07:22.358
Go, go, go!

07:22.359 --> 07:24.358
It's going, it's sinking.
-Frick!

07:24.359 --> 07:26.678
We're just digging a freaking hole.
Let's be smart.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.678
We need something underneath
the front, let me pull it back.

07:28.679 --> 07:30.078
Let me pull it back.

07:30.079 --> 07:31.718
You're going to go forward
and you're going try

07:31.719 --> 07:32.958
and go up and over this bag.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.358
Three, two, one, go.

07:34.359 --> 07:35.838
Well, that didn't work.

07:35.839 --> 07:37.798
Flipping heck, dude. Dammit.

07:37.799 --> 07:40.798
Dig out some sand,
let's dig out some sand.

07:40.799 --> 07:44.381
Oh, you noticed. Today is pretty
much the worst day possible.

07:44.886 --> 07:47.965
So, this is our new friend,
it's the Travelocity gnome.

07:47.966 --> 07:51.725
We're going to spend a lot of time
today getting to 'gnome'.

07:51.726 --> 07:53.787
'Gnome'.

07:53.831 --> 07:55.750
How do you feel about racing camel
on a bike?

07:55.751 --> 07:57.950
Not that excited.

07:57.951 --> 08:00.470
I like riding bikes,
I just don't feel confident on them

08:00.471 --> 08:01.910
when I have to go fast.

08:01.911 --> 08:03.431
It's Zach.

08:09.991 --> 08:11.910
Camel racetrack.

08:11.911 --> 08:13.951
Is that the track? Crap.

08:15.231 --> 08:16.750
Is it in there?

08:16.751 --> 08:19.350
I think so.
-I think so too.

08:19.351 --> 08:21.230
This is the camel track.
Zach and Rachel missed it.

08:21.231 --> 08:23.070
That was a tough miss,
because it's going to take them

08:23.071 --> 08:24.430
several kilometres to
loop back around.

08:24.431 --> 08:26.391
Shoot, we just lost
our first position.

08:30.831 --> 08:32.309
Let's do this.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.309
Who's fast?
This guy looks fast. Get in, baby.

08:35.311 --> 08:38.071
I'm going to be embarrassed
if I get beaten by a camel.

08:41.751 --> 08:43.230
I'm good on my side,
get in the driver's seat.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.191
OK.
-Reverse. Go, go, go, go!

08:48.351 --> 08:50.470
Go! We're in dead last right now.

08:50.471 --> 08:52.590
We have the Express Pass
in our back pocket.

08:52.591 --> 08:54.510
We've go got two legs to use it,

08:54.511 --> 08:56.900
so our goal was to not
have to use it this leg,

08:56.901 --> 08:58.510
but I do not
want to go home today.

08:58.511 --> 09:01.510
Oh, I see it.
-Hi!

09:01.511 --> 09:03.110
This is cool.
-Welcome to the desert.

09:03.111 --> 09:04.900
Thank you.
-Thank you, let's do it.

09:04.901 --> 09:07.310
Whoo! Let's go!

09:07.311 --> 09:09.070
Oh, wow, this is cool.

09:09.071 --> 09:11.510
Whoo!

09:11.511 --> 09:15.430
Dubai, baby, Dubai! Whoo-hoo!
Come on!

09:15.431 --> 09:19.830
Oh, my God, I love him.
Hi, Booboo. I hope you're fast.

09:19.831 --> 09:22.111
Are you a good camel?
He looks strong.

09:23.711 --> 09:25.310
Alright, you guys ready?

09:25.311 --> 09:27.590
We have to follow the race flags.

09:27.591 --> 09:30.350
Come on.
-Come on, guys, get some hustle.

09:30.351 --> 09:32.230
Alright, do you guys
know what a race is?

09:32.231 --> 09:34.630
It doesn't seem like you do.

09:34.631 --> 09:37.110
The only thing I know to do
is talk to it like a dog

09:37.111 --> 09:38.470
and that doesn't seem to be working.

09:38.471 --> 09:40.190
Hup, hup, hup!

09:40.191 --> 09:43.230
There it is right there.
-And park.

09:43.231 --> 09:44.670
Oh, there's two teams here.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.670
Hey, here we are
in the Camel Racing Club.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.190
There's three cars.

09:49.191 --> 09:50.781
Shoot, we got passed.

09:52.471 --> 09:53.900
Let's do this, guys.

09:53.901 --> 09:55.951
Let's just get it done
on the first try.

09:58.351 --> 09:59.780
How do you feel, Ty?

09:59.781 --> 10:02.391
A little nervous. Oh, my God.

10:04.781 --> 10:06.191
(SHOUTING)

10:07.231 --> 10:08.751
Ah!
-Oh, my God.

10:10.351 --> 10:14.430
Holy crap!
-Whoa, camel! Whoa!

10:14.431 --> 10:16.140
Oh, the camels are smoking them.

10:16.141 --> 10:17.950
Shoot.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.590
Oh, man, camels are quick.

10:20.591 --> 10:22.550
Let's go!
-I know.

10:22.551 --> 10:24.950
KOREY: We thought it was going to be
pretty easy to beat the camels

10:24.951 --> 10:29.350
so when we saw them leaving us
in their dust, we were like, whoa.

10:29.351 --> 10:31.470
Come on, Ty!

10:31.471 --> 10:33.310
It's really far.

10:33.311 --> 10:34.350
BURNIE: It was tough.

10:34.351 --> 10:35.750
An all-out sprint
for two kilometres,

10:35.751 --> 10:37.140
that's serious business.

10:37.141 --> 10:40.751
Slow down, camel. Slow down. Ahh.

10:43.391 --> 10:45.431
No. No.

10:46.831 --> 10:49.630
Can we catch it?
-No.

10:49.631 --> 10:51.021
Oh, my God.

10:53.871 --> 10:56.790
What do you think?
-I'm sorry, sweetie.

10:56.791 --> 10:58.150
Want to go with the other one?

10:58.151 --> 10:59.630
Ah-ha.

10:59.631 --> 11:01.110
Are you OK?
(GASPS)

11:01.111 --> 11:03.790
Let's switch. I'm making a call,
we're switching.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.670
Switch.
-I'm making the call.

11:05.671 --> 11:08.030
My legs are burning.
-Ty, we can do it on this next try.

11:08.031 --> 11:09.950
We've got it, yeah.
-My legs are killing me.

11:09.951 --> 11:12.030
I don't think the head start
would save me.

11:12.031 --> 11:13.270
Ah. (GASPS)

11:13.271 --> 11:15.710
I just know
I don't like going fast on bikes.

11:15.711 --> 11:18.110
I realistically
don't think I can do this.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.150
We're going to try this,
give it one race.

11:20.151 --> 11:22.550
Not every challenge
is going to be an easy one.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.110
Those racing camels are no joke.

11:24.111 --> 11:25.750
(COUGHS)

11:25.751 --> 11:27.310
You OK, sweet pie?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.670
Oh, my gosh.

11:28.671 --> 11:29.910
(COUGHS)

11:29.911 --> 11:32.390
Babe, do you want me to pull over,
so you can throw up?

11:32.391 --> 11:33.951
No, I'm fine.

11:36.431 --> 11:38.590
Bedouin camp?

11:38.591 --> 11:40.230
Yes, finally!

11:40.231 --> 11:42.630
Hey.

11:42.631 --> 11:44.590
Hello!

11:44.591 --> 11:47.950
Thank you. Here's our gnome.
-Poor guy, he was like, so lonely.

11:47.951 --> 11:49.430
I know, he's like, all alone.

11:49.431 --> 11:52.630
I can't breathe at all. Holy crap.

11:52.631 --> 11:54.270
Come on, come on.

11:54.271 --> 11:57.510
Definitely not easy.
I wish I was the gnome.

11:57.511 --> 12:01.270
I know. If you see a lake
off in the distance, it's a mirage

12:01.271 --> 12:03.230
and we need to take a break.

12:03.231 --> 12:06.590
There is no water in sight.

12:06.591 --> 12:10.830
It is desert for as many miles
in any direction as you can see.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.550
Babe, stop acting like you're not
struggling, you're just annoying.

12:14.551 --> 12:17.350
Are you not hot?
-I'm a little warm, yeah.

12:17.351 --> 12:19.990
You're a little warm. You're wearing
a freaking flannel in the desert.

12:19.991 --> 12:21.790
Look at him,
he's got a blanket on him.

12:21.791 --> 12:23.790
Hopefully he's a girl.
-He's not even sweating it.

12:23.791 --> 12:25.790
You know what I'm saying? Men.
-He's not even sweating it.

12:25.791 --> 12:26.951
They make me sick.

12:32.871 --> 12:35.670
We just got to knock this out
and get going, man.

12:35.671 --> 12:39.551
This could be huge if we get this,
bro. Come on, boy. Come on.

12:42.071 --> 12:43.830
Go, Rach, go!

12:43.831 --> 12:46.790
(SHOUTING, CAR HORN HOOTS)

12:46.791 --> 12:50.150
Go! Go! Go!

12:50.151 --> 12:53.350
Go! Everything you've got!

12:53.351 --> 12:56.390
You've got it, baby, come on,
push yourself, push your legs.

12:56.391 --> 12:58.390
They're beating them,
we can do it too.

12:58.391 --> 13:00.710
Go, go, go, pedal, pedal! You've got
to push your legs into it.

13:00.711 --> 13:02.590
I can't, babe.

13:02.591 --> 13:04.671
Come on, you're giving up.

13:05.871 --> 13:08.550
800 metres.
Everything you've got, Kurt.

13:08.551 --> 13:11.310
BRODIE: We actually smoked
the camels early on

13:11.311 --> 13:14.310
and then all of a sudden
they were just coming.

13:14.311 --> 13:16.510
600, come on,
we're right at the beginning.

13:16.511 --> 13:18.030
Come on, Kurt!

13:18.031 --> 13:21.350
BRODIE: Me and Kurt were
just slowly, slowly dying.

13:21.351 --> 13:23.150
Come on, buddy!

13:23.151 --> 13:25.510
Everything. Everything!

13:25.511 --> 13:27.791
Everything!

13:29.271 --> 13:32.351
Everything, go! Everything!

13:36.984 --> 13:38.424
Ahhh!

13:40.588 --> 13:43.067
Come on, Kurt! Come on, Kurt!
-Ah!

13:44.123 --> 13:46.962
Everything, everything, go!

13:46.963 --> 13:48.363
Everything!

13:52.283 --> 13:54.043
Whoo!

13:55.803 --> 13:58.042
Yeah!
-Yeah, Brodie!

13:58.043 --> 14:01.122
Ah!
-We beat the camels!

14:01.123 --> 14:02.642
Let's go.

14:02.643 --> 14:05.602
My quads are destroyed,
I can't walk.

14:05.603 --> 14:07.722
Argh!
-Yeah, Brodie!

14:07.723 --> 14:09.842
Ahh!

14:09.843 --> 14:13.602
My legs are on fire.
-Argh. Ahh!

14:13.603 --> 14:15.042
We lost!

14:15.043 --> 14:16.882
Apparently we get a head start
if we do it again.

14:16.883 --> 14:20.082
You don't understand,
I'm afraid of going fast on bikes.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.242
Why didn't you tell me,
"I'm afraid of going fast on bikes"?

14:22.243 --> 14:23.922
I did. I said, "I don't think we
should do this,

14:23.923 --> 14:25.362
"I don't feel comfortable."

14:25.363 --> 14:27.322
OK, well, that doesn't mean you
don't like speed on bikes,

14:27.323 --> 14:29.122
it just means, I don't know.

14:29.123 --> 14:30.802
Brodie, he's got the clue.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.162
My hamstrings and quads are on fire.

14:34.163 --> 14:36.042
This is up to you.
-We switch.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.762
OK.
-I can't do this.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.242
I mean, we are dead last right now.

14:39.243 --> 14:41.122
Well, my biggest fear came true -

14:41.123 --> 14:43.603
I let you down
and I probably cost us the race.

14:45.243 --> 14:46.883
Nose, nose.

14:48.683 --> 14:51.882
<i>PHIL: Teams must now drive
themselves to Atlantis The Palm</i>

14:51.883 --> 14:52.962
<i>and Aquaventure,</i>

14:52.963 --> 14:55.682
<i>the site of an unforgettable
Amazing Race moment.</i>

14:55.683 --> 14:57.482
Get up there.
-No!

14:57.483 --> 14:59.282
Ã‚Â¤1 million to go down a slide.

14:59.283 --> 15:01.002
I can't do it!

15:01.003 --> 15:02.082
I don't want to do it.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.762
You're going to make us lose
the race

15:03.763 --> 15:06.322
if you don't go down a waterslide.

15:06.323 --> 15:09.642
That's probably the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life. Gosh!

15:09.643 --> 15:12.242
The gnome, he was the first one
to cross the finish line,

15:12.243 --> 15:14.363
so he is the victor of the race
today.

15:15.403 --> 15:17.682
Good job, babe.
-Babe, I can't...

15:17.683 --> 15:19.282
I'll wait.

15:19.283 --> 15:20.283
..do anymore.

15:20.284 --> 15:21.762
I can't do anymore.

15:21.763 --> 15:24.322
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

15:24.323 --> 15:26.282
Babe, I need you to listen to me.
I'm going to pass out.

15:26.283 --> 15:27.283
Alright.

15:27.284 --> 15:30.722
MATT: It was really hot out in
the desert, the sand is really deep

15:30.723 --> 15:33.882
so every step it's like walking
through mud almost,

15:33.883 --> 15:35.602
you just sink down into the sand.

15:35.603 --> 15:37.283
We're still so much further.

15:39.443 --> 15:42.922
So, we get a little bit of a
head start on the camels this time.

15:42.923 --> 15:45.122
Hoping we can beat them,
it's our second heat.

15:45.123 --> 15:46.522
We got this, we got this,
we got this.

15:46.523 --> 15:47.723
Go!

15:50.403 --> 15:53.763
Yeah, that's good Ty, good.
Let's go, let's beat some camels.

15:55.683 --> 15:57.242
Hey, this looks awesome.

15:57.243 --> 15:59.602
There's our camels.
Hey, little buddies.

15:59.603 --> 16:01.402
(CAMEL GROANS)

16:01.403 --> 16:03.203
(LAUGHS)

16:04.363 --> 16:06.402
Alright.
-Come on, little buddies.

16:06.403 --> 16:08.362
This is so much better
than racing them.

16:08.363 --> 16:10.403
This is so cool.
-This is pretty awesome.

16:11.803 --> 16:14.042
Come on, Ty!
-We got this.

16:14.043 --> 16:15.362
Come on.

16:15.363 --> 16:17.162
Holy crap.

16:17.163 --> 16:18.883
Good job, Ty.

16:20.883 --> 16:22.283
Man, I'm out of breath.

16:23.643 --> 16:25.242
He's got our clue.
-Thank you.

16:25.243 --> 16:26.842
Hi, how are you?

16:26.843 --> 16:28.922
Bye, camels!

16:28.923 --> 16:30.202
I think we're getting close.

16:30.203 --> 16:33.682
That's something up there.
That's it right there.

16:33.683 --> 16:35.203
Good job. This way, this way.

16:40.043 --> 16:41.522
Hello.

16:41.523 --> 16:44.002
Hello, thank you.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.802
Wow, this is so beautiful.

16:45.803 --> 16:47.163
This is the oasis.

16:49.803 --> 16:52.642
Wow.
-Hm, So good.

16:52.643 --> 16:55.283
This is amazing. They should have
this at the end of every Detour.

16:57.403 --> 17:00.522
Camel milk? What?!

17:00.523 --> 17:01.763
From our camel?

17:02.923 --> 17:06.762
Cheers To The Amazing Race in Dubai.

17:06.762 --> 17:08.992
It tasted like whole milk,
like, really...

17:08.992 --> 17:10.682
Yeah, it was good.
-..full and sweet - really good.

17:10.683 --> 17:13.362
It's actually really good.
-It's really good.

17:13.363 --> 17:14.602
Yes!

17:14.603 --> 17:16.442
Thank you so much.

17:16.443 --> 17:17.712
Come on, baby.

17:17.713 --> 17:20.122
Just come please,
you have car there.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.123
I like being in the car much better.

17:23.233 --> 17:26.203
Come on, Mom, let's kill it.
Let's race these camels.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.472
Oh, my God. Are you ready, Mom?

17:29.473 --> 17:30.523
This is awesome.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.602
Oh, my gosh!

17:37.603 --> 17:39.322
Mom, we can beat these things.

17:39.323 --> 17:41.922
Mom, speed up! Speed up, Mamma,
we can beat these things!

17:41.923 --> 17:43.083
Go, Mamma, go!

17:45.473 --> 17:47.922
Come on, Mamma. Go, mamma! Go!

17:47.923 --> 17:49.993
I'm racing a camel.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.642
I started off going and I was like,

17:52.643 --> 17:53.882
"Man, we're going to get it
first try.

17:53.883 --> 17:55.883
"We're about to catch up
with these other teams."

17:57.203 --> 17:58.282
Holy cow.

17:58.283 --> 17:59.882
Oh, my gosh.

17:59.883 --> 18:01.282
This is so far.

18:01.283 --> 18:04.802
And then I realised that the finish
line is like, forever away...

18:04.803 --> 18:05.922
Oh, man.

18:05.923 --> 18:09.842
..and these camels have just got
endurance like racing camels.

18:09.843 --> 18:11.442
It was OK running like
racing camels.

18:11.443 --> 18:12.562
It was crazy.

18:12.563 --> 18:14.472
Yeah, there's the finish line.

18:14.473 --> 18:16.802
It's OK, now we know. This next one
must beat them then.

18:16.803 --> 18:18.442
We're close, bro. We are re close.

18:18.443 --> 18:20.362
Palm Jumeirah, right?
-Yeah.

18:20.363 --> 18:21.713
Oh, baby!

18:24.233 --> 18:26.162
Aquaventure. Let's go.
-Let's go.

18:26.163 --> 18:28.993
(SCREAMING)

18:31.843 --> 18:34.162
There it is.
Roadblock.

18:34.163 --> 18:40.082
We're asking teams to get into
this enormous <i>750,000 gallon tank</i>

18:40.083 --> 18:41.683
<i>full of sharks.</i>

18:45.123 --> 18:49.402
<i>One team member must pick up
this Amazing Race puzzle</i>

18:49.403 --> 18:53.162
and then return to the surface
to solve it.

18:53.163 --> 18:54.232
Brodie's doing it.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.202
We've got to change first.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.203
It's ridiculous.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.993
Alright, let's get freaky.

19:00.233 --> 19:02.203
Let's go, Brodes. Whoo!

19:04.163 --> 19:06.322
Oh, my God.
-Those swim trunks!

19:06.323 --> 19:08.882
BRODIE: I was like, "There's
a little too much show here."

19:08.883 --> 19:12.923
So, I was very quick to get in
the water to hide myself.

19:14.523 --> 19:18.402
Oh, my gosh. OK, there are
actual sharks in here.

19:18.403 --> 19:20.762
There are large stingrays.

19:20.763 --> 19:21.922
I'm glad Brodie's doing it.

19:21.923 --> 19:24.202
Oh, my gosh!

19:24.203 --> 19:25.442
OK, go down.

19:25.443 --> 19:27.202
Oh, look at him!
He's got like a space hat on.

19:27.203 --> 19:28.682
That's awesome.

19:28.683 --> 19:30.083
Oh, my gosh.

19:34.083 --> 19:37.082
This guy is monstrous!

19:37.083 --> 19:38.472
BRODIE: I was actually
a little nervous

19:38.473 --> 19:41.232
because a shark swam right
in front of my face.

19:41.233 --> 19:42.443
This is pretty sick.

19:44.923 --> 19:46.602
It was definitely a cool experience

19:46.603 --> 19:48.322
but at the same time
it was a little freaky.

19:48.323 --> 19:49.683
My God!

19:52.203 --> 19:55.522
When I got the clue
I had to bring it over to a basket

19:55.523 --> 19:57.883
and these two sharks
were just chilling.

19:59.043 --> 20:01.712
I was like just slowly moving
over 'cause I was like,

20:01.713 --> 20:04.802
"Dude, if these sharks swim right
at me, I'm going to freak out."

20:04.803 --> 20:06.602
There he is, Brodie just showed up.

20:06.603 --> 20:08.962
Awesome. Let's go!

20:08.963 --> 20:11.712
Sharks right by the cage,

20:11.713 --> 20:13.642
now I have to do a freaking puzzle?

20:13.643 --> 20:15.282
He's been dramatic as always.

20:15.283 --> 20:18.322
Hey, no matter what happens,
you look good in that gold...

20:18.323 --> 20:19.603
..whatever that thing is.

20:21.233 --> 20:23.162
Oh, what the heck?

20:23.163 --> 20:27.082
There's a couple of items in here -
an R, an A, a C, an E

20:27.083 --> 20:31.562
and I have to match up the four
letters and these little indentions.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.442
Ah! Does it not slide in?

20:33.443 --> 20:36.343
This is really hard, man. Ah!

20:37.139 --> 20:39.018
The sand is deep, come on camel.

20:40.059 --> 20:42.088
I like this Detour so much better.

20:42.089 --> 20:44.058
This is a cool experience, right?
-Yeah.

20:44.059 --> 20:46.538
I feel like I'm in a Star Wars
movie.

20:46.539 --> 20:49.298
I literally have 20 pounds of sand
in my shoes.

20:49.299 --> 20:51.018
(LAUGHS)

20:51.019 --> 20:53.739
Here we go, here we go.
-Oh, I see the camp.

20:55.059 --> 20:57.458
Wow. Thank you.

20:57.459 --> 20:58.938
Thank you so much.

20:58.939 --> 20:59.939
Oh, that's great.

20:59.940 --> 21:03.018
Come, this is camel milk...
-Very nice, thank you.

21:03.019 --> 21:05.088
..and we have something for you.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.538
Hey, look what we got!

21:06.539 --> 21:08.218
Thank you very much. Thank you.

21:08.219 --> 21:09.569
Thank you for your hospitality.

21:11.089 --> 21:12.618
Come on, camel.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.018
Yeah, good camel.

21:14.019 --> 21:15.698
Keep running.

21:15.699 --> 21:17.848
You're doing great, babe.

21:17.849 --> 21:20.138
Holy cow! Look how much sand
I got in my shoe.

21:20.139 --> 21:22.618
(SHE LAUGHS)
-There's another team. Who's that?

21:22.619 --> 21:24.328
They're chugging.
-I think it's Zach and Rachel.

21:24.329 --> 21:25.898
Good, we got a lead on them.

21:25.899 --> 21:27.818
Good girl. Rachy, it's here.
-OK.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.379
Down the hill.
-Come on, baby.

21:31.379 --> 21:32.458
Come on.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.738
Park it, Rach.

21:33.739 --> 21:35.538
We're not sure if we're still going
the right way,

21:35.539 --> 21:38.778
we didn't really see any signs
that said the Atlantis

21:38.779 --> 21:40.498
But it had to have been back there.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.088
Do you want to just turn around?
-Kind of.

21:43.089 --> 21:44.218
OK.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.458
That's putting us back
on the interstate.

21:46.459 --> 21:48.778
We missed something, somehow.
I don't know.

21:48.779 --> 21:52.778
I doubt anyone is having this much
trouble finding it.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.098
Brodie, what have you got done
there?

21:54.099 --> 21:55.618
Nothing. This is like really hard.

21:55.619 --> 21:57.978
You've got to get your letters
to line up.

21:57.979 --> 22:00.098
Come on, Baby. No!

22:00.099 --> 22:01.898
Come on, Brodes. Come on, baby!

22:01.899 --> 22:04.258
Oh, come on. Get in your home.

22:04.259 --> 22:05.338
Get in your home!

22:05.339 --> 22:08.218
I can't figure out
any sort of technique.

22:08.219 --> 22:09.738
I'll tell you right now,
it's a lot harder

22:09.739 --> 22:11.578
than throwing a frisbee
to someone on that water slide.

22:11.579 --> 22:13.098
This puzzle's freaking hard.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.138
Ah!

22:15.139 --> 22:17.539
Try some camel milk.
-Thank you.

22:19.019 --> 22:21.058
That is good.
-I have something for you.

22:21.059 --> 22:24.978
Yay. Thank you so much. Thank you.

22:24.979 --> 22:26.458
Let's go, Mamma!

22:26.459 --> 22:28.138
Let's beat these camels.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.778
Mamma, we're almost there, come on.

22:29.779 --> 22:32.218
400 left, let's go.

22:32.219 --> 22:34.338
Mom, they're catching up. Let's go!

22:34.339 --> 22:37.659
They're right behind you! Ah!

22:42.819 --> 22:44.978
Mom, pedal! Yeah!

22:44.979 --> 22:46.979
Yeah, Mamma!

22:48.619 --> 22:50.258
Good job, Mom.

22:50.259 --> 22:51.658
He was right on your tail.

22:51.659 --> 22:53.538
Yes! Thank you.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.338
Oh, my gosh.

22:55.339 --> 22:58.258
I gave it all I got.
I may not be able to walk tomorrow.

22:58.259 --> 23:00.138
Oh, my God!
-Let's go, Mom.

23:00.139 --> 23:03.058
Oh, my God. I can't run.

23:03.059 --> 23:06.139
Mom, why are you running so funny?
-My butt hurts.

23:07.179 --> 23:08.179
That's it.

23:08.180 --> 23:12.259
So, me, Korey and the gnome have
finally found Atlantis The Palm.

23:13.939 --> 23:15.738
I got the gnome.
-You got the gnome? You got the clue?

23:15.739 --> 23:17.738
Here's another team.
It's the dancers, wow.

23:17.739 --> 23:19.498
Oh, yellow team beat us.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.578
Damn, I'm so frustrated.

23:21.579 --> 23:23.338
It just doesn't seem possible.

23:23.339 --> 23:25.498
You can't do something different.

23:25.499 --> 23:27.738
I'm thinking, man.
I don't know what to do.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.858
I've got plans just to use the
freaking Express Pass, honestly.

23:30.859 --> 23:33.778
You're already picking
the Express Pass?

23:33.779 --> 23:35.739
You just need to chill, Brodie.
Just chill, dude.

23:36.819 --> 23:39.139
Oh, my gosh, why is it spinning?

23:43.459 --> 23:45.858
This is exactly the swimsuit
that I have at home.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.618
This one's a little bit roomy.

23:47.619 --> 23:50.098
This is pretty typical
in the hip-hop dance world.

23:50.099 --> 23:52.259
I'm having some major issues here.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.978
I really am sorry, Mom,
about that bathing suit.

23:55.979 --> 23:57.098
You look great.

23:57.099 --> 24:00.539
I think everyone got more than they
bargained for at Aquaventure today.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.978
Did you get it?
-No.

24:03.979 --> 24:06.458
I'm not close, man.
I'm not close at all.

24:06.459 --> 24:07.858
Kurt, it's your call, bro.

24:07.859 --> 24:09.418
You're sure you can't do that?

24:09.419 --> 24:11.218
I think it's a waste of time.

24:11.219 --> 24:13.338
It might be nice to use
the Express Pass

24:13.339 --> 24:16.058
before another team gets here,
so they don't see us use it.

24:16.059 --> 24:17.778
OK. Done, go.

24:17.779 --> 24:20.058
We're using Express Pass.
-Express Pass.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.699
Boom. Good challenge.

24:23.059 --> 24:25.258
"Make your way to
Poseidon's Revenge."

24:25.259 --> 24:28.298
<i>PHIL: Teams will now face
a whole new level of fear</i>

24:28.299 --> 24:32.498
<i>as they take on Poseidon's Revenge -
Atlantis' new water slide.</i>

24:32.499 --> 24:34.259
<i>It's twice as long
as the Leap Of Faith...</i>

24:35.339 --> 24:36.739
<i>..and a whole lot scarier.</i>

24:38.539 --> 24:39.578
Let's go.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.579
It's here, Dana.

24:45.219 --> 24:47.259
Cole, what exit is it?

24:48.579 --> 24:50.219
Oh, baby, God!

24:51.819 --> 24:53.618
This is just ridiculous.

24:53.619 --> 24:54.978
I don't even know
where the hell I am.

24:54.979 --> 24:55.979
I'm sorry, baby.

24:55.980 --> 24:57.858
Just stay calm
and we'll ask somebody

24:57.859 --> 24:59.139
whenever we see somebody, right?

25:02.739 --> 25:05.058
You're looking good, baby.

25:05.059 --> 25:06.299
Whoo-hoo!

25:07.379 --> 25:08.698
Oh, boy!

25:08.699 --> 25:10.498
Whoever put us in those swimsuits

25:10.499 --> 25:13.018
and then immediately dropped us into
ice cold water, thank you for that.

25:13.019 --> 25:14.818
Oh, wow, that's awesome.

25:14.819 --> 25:17.099
You're in a tank
surrounded by sharks.

25:18.099 --> 25:21.898
I was fully expecting some people
to have full-on panic attacks.

25:21.899 --> 25:25.019
You got it, babe!
Swim with the sharks.

25:26.939 --> 25:28.418
Look at Dana's face.

25:28.419 --> 25:30.338
I'm a little nervous.

25:30.339 --> 25:31.658
There are sharks in there.

25:31.659 --> 25:32.898
Thanks, Korey.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.538
There's sharks in there.

25:35.539 --> 25:36.738
They're huge.

25:36.739 --> 25:38.178
You got it, babe.

25:38.179 --> 25:39.698
This is crazy.

25:39.699 --> 25:41.578
It feels like you're on the moon.

25:41.579 --> 25:42.818
Holy crap.

25:42.819 --> 25:44.579
I want to go down that.

25:46.179 --> 25:47.859
That's the slide.

25:49.859 --> 25:51.978
Step aside.

25:51.979 --> 25:55.898
I can't believe they got out
because of that slide.

25:55.899 --> 25:57.059
Crazy.

25:59.259 --> 26:01.378
Hello.

26:01.379 --> 26:02.739
Oh, my God.

26:08.419 --> 26:11.139
We're still missing Cole and Sheri,
so you're good.

26:13.499 --> 26:15.258
No way this is right.

26:15.259 --> 26:16.978
There's nobody to ask.

26:16.979 --> 26:19.458
Like, there's no gas station,
there's just nothing.

26:19.459 --> 26:22.098
It's like, if you get lost,
you're screwed.

26:22.099 --> 26:24.178
This is just not fun.

26:24.179 --> 26:25.779
I don't even know what to do, Cole.

26:33.712 --> 26:36.591
I don't even know what to do, baby.
This is just not fun.

26:36.592 --> 26:39.111
I'll just ask somebody
whenever we see somebody.

26:39.112 --> 26:40.792
Do what we've got to do.

26:43.274 --> 26:44.553
Here we go, Brodie.

26:44.554 --> 26:46.353
Holy shoot!

26:46.354 --> 26:47.954
Oh, my gosh.

26:50.954 --> 26:52.433
Alright!

26:52.434 --> 26:54.593
Oh, my gosh.

26:54.594 --> 26:55.833
Oh, baby!

26:55.834 --> 26:57.554
Whoo!

26:59.834 --> 27:00.913
Whoo!

27:00.914 --> 27:02.233
Holy shoot!

27:02.234 --> 27:04.153
Argh!

27:04.154 --> 27:05.674
Aghhh!

27:12.634 --> 27:14.993
Oh, my gosh!

27:14.994 --> 27:18.193
Argh! Whoa!

27:18.194 --> 27:19.954
Agh! Oh!

27:21.674 --> 27:22.994
Whoo!

27:24.754 --> 27:26.474
Whoo!

27:28.674 --> 27:30.193
Whoo!

27:30.194 --> 27:31.353
Thank you.

27:31.354 --> 27:32.993
Oh, boy.

27:32.994 --> 27:36.753
The best way to cross Dubai Creek
is in a water taxi like this

27:36.754 --> 27:38.233
<i>called an abra.</i>

27:38.234 --> 27:42.233
<i>Teams will find me on the other side
at the Old Souq Station.</i>

27:42.234 --> 27:45.474
The last team to check-in
may be eliminated.

27:50.034 --> 27:51.873
How are you guys getting it
in there?

27:51.874 --> 27:53.793
You trying to get them
on the front side or the back side?

27:53.794 --> 27:55.073
How in the world?

27:55.074 --> 27:57.553
Can't tell if we get it through the
back or through the front.

27:57.554 --> 28:00.793
I think there's a ditch in the back.
Maybe I'm wrong.

28:00.794 --> 28:02.673
Is this, like, for real
how you do this?

28:02.674 --> 28:06.033
We can't just brake it on the floor
and put the puzzle together?

28:06.034 --> 28:07.434
'Cause that would be a lot easier.

28:09.074 --> 28:10.273
This is awesome.

28:10.274 --> 28:11.593
ZACH: It's such a weird sensation.

28:11.594 --> 28:14.233
If feels like you're in a dream,
like running in slow motion.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.753
This is awesome.

28:15.754 --> 28:17.234
Oh, it's so close.

28:18.794 --> 28:20.873
Yes, that's it.

28:20.874 --> 28:23.074
You guys having any kind
a luck with this?

28:26.194 --> 28:28.354
Burnie, I think it's good to be
through the back, dude.

28:30.554 --> 28:33.434
Yes. Judge! Judge.

28:37.354 --> 28:39.433
Thank you! Babe, we got it.

28:39.434 --> 28:42.993
KOREY: When Burnie got the puzzle
correct we both asked him...

28:42.994 --> 28:44.273
front or back?
-Got it!

28:44.274 --> 28:46.473
..and he just ignored both of us
and kind of ran out.

28:46.474 --> 28:50.074
He didn't answer us.
Probably because it is the front?

28:51.474 --> 28:53.113
A store!

28:53.114 --> 28:56.953
We're not at Palm, Atlantis
but we're at Happy Grocery.

28:56.954 --> 28:59.753
Hey, we're lost.
Do you know Atlantis, The Palm?

28:59.754 --> 29:01.353
This is the road here, OK?

29:01.354 --> 29:03.393
After that you will follow D63.

29:03.394 --> 29:06.793
And once we're there, we'll be able
to follow these instructions?

29:06.794 --> 29:08.473
Thank you so much.
-OK.

29:08.474 --> 29:13.154
We're getting good on the game
part but the navigation, we suck!

29:17.194 --> 29:19.033
Zach is so focused.

29:19.034 --> 29:21.353
Yeah, he's really good at puzzles.

29:21.354 --> 29:22.873
I've got the R and the C now.

29:22.874 --> 29:24.433
This is actually starting
to get to be fun.

29:24.434 --> 29:27.354
I hate this stuff! Hate it.

29:30.994 --> 29:32.114
Judge.

29:36.114 --> 29:38.553
This is really the kind of thing
that could sends us home

29:38.554 --> 29:41.073
because I'm not a puzzle person
and I don't know

29:41.074 --> 29:42.474
what I'm supposed to be doing.

29:44.594 --> 29:46.873
The Palm Jumeirah. Boom.

29:46.874 --> 29:48.993
(BEATBOXES)

29:48.994 --> 29:50.994
That's it...

29:51.994 --> 29:53.473
Hey, this looks awesome.

29:53.474 --> 29:55.393
Alright, send her down.
Are you ready?

29:55.394 --> 29:57.154
You're going to be great.

29:58.474 --> 30:00.833
Alright, I'm not doing that.
There's no way.

30:00.834 --> 30:02.393
Argh!

30:02.394 --> 30:03.993
Ahh!

30:03.994 --> 30:05.713
Whoo!

30:05.714 --> 30:06.954
This side in?

30:08.154 --> 30:10.033
That's so much fun.

30:10.034 --> 30:11.513
Bye, Burnie!

30:11.514 --> 30:13.673
We see Burnie in a coffin...

30:13.674 --> 30:14.834
Hey, guys...

30:16.114 --> 30:17.874
..and out of nowhere
he just disappears!

30:19.034 --> 30:20.793
Oh, my God.
Your turn now.

30:20.794 --> 30:22.994
(LAUGHS)

30:24.274 --> 30:25.833
Are your pieces still in one piece?

30:25.834 --> 30:28.193
I think I have pieces where there
are not supposed to be pieces!

30:28.194 --> 30:30.833
Alright, thank you very much.

30:30.834 --> 30:32.153
You got it, Zach.

30:32.154 --> 30:33.914
Oh, baby.

30:36.314 --> 30:37.953
Oh, man, this is so close.

30:37.954 --> 30:39.954
There we go, got it. Judge.

30:41.474 --> 30:42.753
Thank you.

30:42.754 --> 30:44.673
You can do it, babe.
Take a deep breath. It's OK.

30:44.674 --> 30:46.073
Oh, man.

30:46.074 --> 30:47.193
This is torture.

30:47.194 --> 30:49.193
I really hate to lose to boys.

30:49.194 --> 30:51.993
I have one letter
completely locked in.

30:51.994 --> 30:53.633
I kind of felt like I might
start to melt down

30:53.634 --> 30:56.114
because I am that kind of person.

30:58.954 --> 31:00.753
Bye. See you never.

31:00.754 --> 31:01.833
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:01.834 --> 31:05.713
WOMAN: Three, two, one...

31:05.714 --> 31:09.714
(SCREAMS)

31:13.514 --> 31:14.673
Oh!

31:14.674 --> 31:16.473
(LAUGHS)

31:16.474 --> 31:18.633
Oh, my God.

31:18.634 --> 31:20.993
It was so good!

31:20.994 --> 31:24.593
Three, two, one.
(BUZZER)

31:24.594 --> 31:26.594
Argh!

31:33.834 --> 31:35.393
(LAUGHS)

31:35.394 --> 31:36.953
Good job, Kor!

31:36.954 --> 31:38.553
Oh, my God!

31:38.554 --> 31:40.274
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Let's go.

31:41.954 --> 31:43.034
Korey, that was fun.

31:45.274 --> 31:48.713
I already kind of feel like an idiot
having to use the Express Pass,

31:48.714 --> 31:50.433
but I'm going to feel like
a way bigger idiot

31:50.434 --> 31:52.193
if we used it
and we don't get first.

31:52.194 --> 31:54.233
A street.
Is that what we need?

31:54.234 --> 31:55.273
That street was back there

31:55.274 --> 31:57.473
and that's where it says
we have to park.

31:57.474 --> 31:58.833
Oh, my gosh.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.073
Go up here and take a right.
-I can't take a right.

32:01.074 --> 32:03.353
Right here.
-I cannot take a right.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.754
Calm down.
-Oh, my gosh.

32:05.914 --> 32:08.833
I got that third one in
and now let me get this R in.

32:08.834 --> 32:11.674
Alright, R, are you ready,
you pain in the ass?

32:12.834 --> 32:14.873
We've got a lead, we think,
on the red team,

32:14.874 --> 32:16.753
so she just needs to stay calm

32:16.754 --> 32:18.793
and make sure
she gets it done right.

32:18.794 --> 32:20.953
I'll take the bait.
-I think you're diving in that.

32:20.954 --> 32:22.153
There's sharks in there though.

32:22.154 --> 32:24.833
Oh, my gosh. (LAUGHS)

32:24.834 --> 32:26.553
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

32:26.554 --> 32:28.113
Oh, yeah.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.913
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

32:29.914 --> 32:31.353
Yes! Good job, babe.

32:31.354 --> 32:32.633
I hate puzzles.

32:32.634 --> 32:34.193
She looks so scared.

32:34.194 --> 32:35.194
Oh, my gosh.

32:35.195 --> 32:38.593
Three, two, one...
-Bye, baby.

32:38.594 --> 32:40.834
(SCREAMS)

32:42.474 --> 32:44.714
Oh, my gosh.

32:46.314 --> 32:48.113
Oh.

32:48.114 --> 32:50.313
Whoo!

32:50.314 --> 32:53.034
I'm so scared. I am so scared.

32:56.194 --> 32:57.634
Argh!

32:58.954 --> 33:00.474
(SHRIEKS)

33:06.154 --> 33:07.993
Oh!

33:07.994 --> 33:09.794
OK, let's go.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.233
I just see lots of sharks
and stingrays.

33:14.234 --> 33:17.394
Are they feeding these sharks now?!

33:19.914 --> 33:21.953
It's a little scary.

33:21.954 --> 33:23.393
He's a cute boy.

33:23.394 --> 33:25.313
He doesn't need to have
any missing body parts.

33:25.314 --> 33:28.634
Oh, this is a little freaky.

33:33.754 --> 33:35.993
"Take an abra across Dubai Creek."

33:35.994 --> 33:37.873
Those that like abras to me.
-Yes.

33:37.874 --> 33:40.473
There's Burnie and Ashley.
Holy crap.

33:40.474 --> 33:41.833
Let's go to the abra station.

33:41.834 --> 33:43.393
Let's beat Brodie and Kurt.

33:43.394 --> 33:44.513
Boat race, let's do it.

33:44.514 --> 33:45.833
Fast, fast, fast, fast.

33:45.834 --> 33:47.513
Beat them. Can you beat them?

33:47.514 --> 33:49.993
Go, go, go, go!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:49.994 --> 33:52.513
Catch 'em! We've got to go faster.

33:52.514 --> 33:53.514
(HORN BEEPS)

33:53.515 --> 33:55.713
It a race, baby. Let's go!

33:55.714 --> 33:57.753
Baby, we're gunning for first.
-Alright.

33:57.754 --> 33:59.193
Are you ready to run?

33:59.194 --> 34:00.713
It's going to be
a foot race to the mat.

34:00.714 --> 34:01.753
Is that Phil?

34:01.754 --> 34:03.113
There he is right there.
-That's Phil.

34:03.114 --> 34:04.953
Hey, can you park right here?
Park right here.

34:04.954 --> 34:06.673
Let's go, Brodie. It's a Pit Stop.
We can run.

34:06.674 --> 34:08.553
Let's go! We got this.

34:08.554 --> 34:10.184
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

34:11.954 --> 34:13.072
Go, go, go!

34:13.074 --> 34:15.072
Yeah, Phil!
Come on, Kurt.

34:15.074 --> 34:16.914
Oh, my God, what a leg.

34:18.353 --> 34:20.703
Welcome to Dubai,
the United Arab Emirates.

34:20.704 --> 34:22.913
Thank you.
-Whoo! Dubai.

34:22.914 --> 34:25.143
Brodie and Kurt,
you are team number one.

34:25.143 --> 34:26.592
Whoo!

34:26.594 --> 34:27.753
And here's your competition.

34:27.754 --> 34:29.433
Yeah. Nice job.

34:29.434 --> 34:32.433
Burnie and Ashley,
almost chased down first place.

34:32.434 --> 34:34.393
Unfortunately,
you're team number two.

34:34.393 --> 34:37.353
Congratulations.
-We'll take it.

34:37.353 --> 34:39.513
Brodie and Kurt, I am pleased
to tell you that you have won

34:39.514 --> 34:40.793
a trip for two from Travelocity

34:40.793 --> 34:43.183
and you are going
to Helsinki, Finland.

34:43.184 --> 34:44.592
Whoo! Yeah, boy.
-Let's go.

34:44.594 --> 34:46.433
Sound good?
-Yes, sir. -That sounds great.

34:46.434 --> 34:48.072
<i>You're going to spend five nights</i>

34:48.074 --> 34:50.183
<i>in a sea view room
at the Hotel Haven.</i>

34:50.184 --> 34:53.833
<i>You're going to enjoy a canal cruise
and sightseeing tour</i>

34:53.833 --> 34:58.433
<i>and relax with a therapeutic
massage at Kamp Spa.</i>

34:58.434 --> 34:59.553
Boom.

34:59.554 --> 35:01.233
I think I'm taking that one.
-That one sounds nice.

35:01.234 --> 35:03.703
Using the Express Pass
was definitely the right move.

35:03.704 --> 35:06.394
Thankfully, we won, but the race
is only getting harder.

35:07.594 --> 35:10.314
Whoo!

35:17.314 --> 35:18.664
Come on, Dana!

35:20.184 --> 35:21.514
Holy crap!

35:22.514 --> 35:23.954
Let's go!

35:27.114 --> 35:29.313
I've got a wedgie and a half!

35:29.314 --> 35:30.994
Thank you so much.

35:33.434 --> 35:35.593
Alright, come on, Cole.
You can do it.

35:35.594 --> 35:36.753
One more.

35:36.754 --> 35:39.793
This is faster than any of the
Roadblocks I have done.

35:39.794 --> 35:41.313
Get in there.

35:41.314 --> 35:43.953
Ooh, look at...
It's falling in there.

35:43.954 --> 35:45.633
Oh, that's it.

35:45.634 --> 35:47.513
Yes, thank you.

35:47.514 --> 35:49.514
Yay!
-Let's go.

35:51.184 --> 35:53.313
Wow. This is cool.

35:53.314 --> 35:54.514
Good job today.

35:55.914 --> 35:57.593
There we go.
-Oh, yeah.

35:57.594 --> 35:58.793
There's Phil!

35:58.794 --> 36:00.474
Phil!

36:02.704 --> 36:03.953
Hi.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.753
We learnt a traditional greeting.

36:05.754 --> 36:06.993
You mean in the Bedouin camp?

36:06.994 --> 36:08.953
Do you want to do it?
-Oh, Tyler, look at you.

36:08.954 --> 36:10.033
Come here.
-Oh, boy.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.993
Tut, tut, Phil!

36:11.994 --> 36:13.273
He's like, "Uh-uh."

36:13.274 --> 36:14.994
(LAUGHS)

36:16.794 --> 36:18.833
I think we're in dead last.
Dead last.

36:18.834 --> 36:21.313
Does it say make a right
on Crescent Road?

36:21.314 --> 36:23.073
Babe, I need you to listen to me...
-I'm listening.

36:23.074 --> 36:24.703
..when I say the directions.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.833
"Slight left towards Crescent Road.

36:26.834 --> 36:29.993
"At the roundabout, take the
third exit onto Crescent Road."

36:29.994 --> 36:31.113
So which way do you think?

36:31.114 --> 36:33.663
Did I say left literally
10,000 times?

36:33.664 --> 36:35.433
This way?
-I don't know!

36:35.434 --> 36:37.113
I'm asking you to tell me
where to go.

36:37.114 --> 36:40.353
I can't tell you.
Why don't you understand me?!

36:40.354 --> 36:43.513
I can't tell you any more
than what's written on this thing.

36:43.514 --> 36:45.233
Why don't you understand that?

36:45.234 --> 36:48.513
But if that doesn't
make sense to us...

36:48.514 --> 36:51.233
..then we need to stop and ask
somebody, that's what I'm saying.

36:51.234 --> 36:53.033
I really think something
is mentally wrong with you.

36:53.034 --> 36:54.873
DANA: I'd give him a clear
instruction and he'd be like,

36:54.874 --> 36:56.143
"Left, are you sure?"

36:56.144 --> 37:00.663
I don't like feeling challenged,
so I start to challenge back.

37:00.664 --> 37:02.703
Calm down, let's work together
and figure it out.

37:02.704 --> 37:05.033
I'm not going to be working with you
if this is how you're going to act.

37:05.034 --> 37:07.313
I swear to God. You can get out
of this car and we'll forfeit.

37:07.314 --> 37:09.273
I am not running with you
like this ever again.

37:09.274 --> 37:10.703
Calm down!
-No, I'm not going to calm down.

37:10.704 --> 37:12.353
What are you getting
so worked up about?

37:12.354 --> 37:14.313
You're out of control.
-Stop fighting with me.

37:14.314 --> 37:16.143
We're in a race.
-Shut up, Matt! Just shut up.

37:16.144 --> 37:18.753
Look, I'm seriously done with you.

37:18.754 --> 37:20.703
I'm honestly,
just so disappointed in you.

37:20.704 --> 37:21.913
I'm disappointed in you too.

37:21.914 --> 37:23.274
You're psychotic!

37:25.874 --> 37:27.663
Oh, my gosh!

37:27.664 --> 37:29.554
Cole, that looks so scary.

37:31.914 --> 37:34.273
(SCREAMS)

37:34.274 --> 37:36.273
Oh, oh, oh!

37:36.274 --> 37:37.914
(LAUGHS)

37:42.704 --> 37:45.913
When I got out, these-length shorts

37:45.914 --> 37:48.513
went to like, these-length shorts.

37:48.514 --> 37:50.314
Uh!

37:52.794 --> 37:55.033
Oh, my gosh, I'm kind of scared!

37:55.034 --> 37:56.034
Are you ready?

37:56.035 --> 37:58.033
Oh, my gosh.

37:58.034 --> 37:59.793
(BUZZER)

37:59.794 --> 38:00.994
(SHRIEKS)

38:08.834 --> 38:10.993
Oh...
-We did it.

38:10.994 --> 38:13.233
Oh, my gosh. -That was awesome,
wasn't it? -That was crazy.

38:13.234 --> 38:15.313
"Warning,
last team may be eliminated."

38:15.314 --> 38:18.073
Let's go.
-Let's go.

38:18.074 --> 38:20.553
If we lose today,
you can take the hit for it.

38:20.554 --> 38:24.143
It's not me taking the hit,
I'm just asking you to work WITH me.

38:24.144 --> 38:25.663
Tell me where to go.
-Stop the car.

38:25.664 --> 38:28.073
STOP the car.
Go talk to those people.

38:28.074 --> 38:29.663
Thank you. Jesus.

38:29.664 --> 38:31.703
I just yell. Like, I'm a yeller.

38:31.704 --> 38:33.393
I grew up in a house
where everybody yelled.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.553
And I was saying to myself,

38:34.554 --> 38:36.953
"Just calm down. Like, don't yell,"
but I just couldn't.

38:36.954 --> 38:38.993
Do they know where the place is?
-No.

38:38.994 --> 38:40.793
Will you help me and work with me?

38:40.794 --> 38:42.473
I'm trying. You don't... listen.
-No, you're not.

38:42.474 --> 38:44.183
Should I ask...?
-You just do whatever you want.

38:44.184 --> 38:45.703
Yeah, go ahead, ask that guy.

38:45.704 --> 38:47.393
I was just at like,
at my tipping point

38:47.394 --> 38:48.663
and I just shut down.

38:48.664 --> 38:50.513
I'll follow you,
you tell me what you want to do.

38:50.514 --> 38:51.703
Honestly, babe, I don't know.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.663
Sometimes you just need to know
when to tap out.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.353
No! Come on, that's ridiculous.

38:55.354 --> 38:56.593
Come on, get in the car.

38:56.594 --> 38:58.553
No, I'm going to quit 'cause you
and I are not getting along.

38:58.554 --> 39:00.553
No, come on.
-I'm not getting back in the car.

39:00.554 --> 39:03.953
DANA: I was like, yelling
and everything just broke down.

39:03.954 --> 39:04.954
We couldn't recover.

39:04.955 --> 39:06.595
I'm not getting back in the car
like that.

39:14.594 --> 39:16.753
Sometimes you just need to know
when to tap out.

39:16.754 --> 39:19.233
No! Come on, that's ridiculous.

39:19.234 --> 39:21.313
We're a team.
-No, we're not.

39:21.314 --> 39:22.753
Not as far as I'm concerned anymore.

39:22.754 --> 39:25.633
Come on, let's work together and find it.
-No, I'm not doing this. No.

39:25.634 --> 39:28.873
Dana definitely wears her emotions
on her sleeve

39:28.874 --> 39:31.553
and sometimes that means
we get a little bit heated.

39:31.554 --> 39:36.353
Can you handle letting me navigate
and understand I am also lost?

39:36.354 --> 39:37.473
Yes.

39:37.474 --> 39:40.433
MATT: I know that Dana now loves me,
so anything that she says,

39:40.434 --> 39:41.993
I know it's only about the stress.

39:41.994 --> 39:43.833
It's a heated moment
and then it passes.

39:43.834 --> 39:45.434
I just want this day to be over.

39:48.234 --> 39:50.753
Let's go! Ha-ha-ha!

39:50.754 --> 39:51.793
Got to want it.

39:51.794 --> 39:53.914
I want it.
-Really want to see it.

39:58.914 --> 40:00.474
Come on, Rachey.

40:02.354 --> 40:05.143
Oh, Zach and Rachel.
-Hi.

40:05.144 --> 40:07.073
It's been a long day, Phil.
-It's been a long day.

40:07.074 --> 40:08.703
A little smile there, Rachel.

40:08.704 --> 40:10.703
I've still got him by my side, so...

40:10.704 --> 40:11.994
We're still in love.

40:24.634 --> 40:26.234
Hey, guys.

40:27.274 --> 40:29.833
Are you talking to each other
right now or is it a little...?

40:29.834 --> 40:31.513
'Cause I'm feeling like...

40:31.514 --> 40:33.793
Can you see this, Ali,
like a wall between them right now?

40:33.794 --> 40:34.953
I can totally see that.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.633
Yeah, we unfortunately had
a really big argument.

40:36.634 --> 40:39.513
I just think we handle stressful
situations very differently

40:39.514 --> 40:41.953
and we're not finding a way
to, like, meet in the middle,

40:41.954 --> 40:43.704
so we really ripped
each other's heads off.

40:44.794 --> 40:47.473
Dana and Matt,
hold your head up high

40:47.474 --> 40:49.353
'cause you're team number five,

40:49.354 --> 40:50.394
you are still in the race.

40:51.434 --> 40:53.433
That said, you're a team.

40:53.434 --> 40:55.703
If you're going to win this race,
you've got to do it together.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.954
Absolutely. It's OK.

40:58.994 --> 41:01.703
DANA: I want to be here just as much
as he does, I love him

41:01.704 --> 41:03.993
and I don't want to ever
treat him that way.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.834
And there's really no excuse for it,
no matter how stressed out you are.

41:12.074 --> 41:13.833
Alright!

41:13.834 --> 41:15.234
Finally.

41:19.184 --> 41:20.594
Oh, Sheri and Cole.

41:22.394 --> 41:24.273
They look reasonably happy.

41:24.274 --> 41:25.433
They do.

41:25.434 --> 41:28.313
There just comes a point
where you accept what it is.

41:28.314 --> 41:31.873
You still do your best,
you don't give up, but, you know?

41:31.874 --> 41:34.114
We know.
-But you don't know everything.

41:35.114 --> 41:37.394
This is a non-elimination leg.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.353
Oh, my gosh.

41:40.354 --> 41:44.553
And that means that you are
still in The Amazing Race

41:44.554 --> 41:47.833
and you have survived to race
another leg.

41:47.834 --> 41:50.143
The other teams are going to hate us
because you don't get saved twice

41:50.144 --> 41:51.703
in a game like this.
-You don't get saved twice.

41:51.704 --> 41:53.433
Sometime during the next leg
of the race,

41:53.434 --> 41:55.273
you will encounter a Speed Bump.

41:55.274 --> 41:58.793
You have to complete that Speed Bump
before you can carry on racing

41:58.794 --> 42:00.993
and then you've got to try to
catch up with the other teams.

42:00.994 --> 42:03.313
Just don't let me drive anywhere.
Come on!

42:03.314 --> 42:05.113
I need a taxi!

42:05.114 --> 42:06.833
I need a taxi.

42:06.834 --> 42:08.913
We are very shocked and excited.

42:08.914 --> 42:10.703
Whop, whop! Still hanging in!

42:10.704 --> 42:12.073
We're still here.

42:12.074 --> 42:13.993
Still... Bop, bob!

42:13.994 --> 42:17.034
We've got heart
and we want it and...
