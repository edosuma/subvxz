BUT CAN WE PLEASE
PAUSE FOR A MOMENT

02:13.350 --> 02:14.830
TO APPRECIATE THE FACT
THAT THOSE WORDS

02:31.194 --> 02:33.065
BATWOMAN.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.545
NO,
YOU DIDN'T.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.287
IT WAS A PECK THAT
LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.202
BATWOMAN CAN'T
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.987
IT WAS A KISS, LUKE.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.641
YEAH, LAST NIGHT.
THEN WHAT?

02:43.685 --> 02:45.121
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.036
DOES SHE KNOW
WHO YOU ARE?

02:47.079 --> 02:48.690
SOPHIE: I HAVE NO IDEA,

02:48.733 --> 02:51.475
WHICH, I ADMIT, IS
A LITTLE STRANGE, BUT--

02:51.519 --> 02:52.955
YOU SAID YOU KNEW
WHO SHE WAS.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.261
I THOUGHT I DID.

02:54.304 --> 02:57.002
I WAS WRONG, LIKE,
REALLY, REALLY WRONG.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.917
SO YOU SERIOUSLY
HAVE NO IDEA.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.703
NO. WAIT. DO YOU?

03:01.746 --> 03:03.618
NO.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.185
YOU FINALLY GET
SOPHIE OFF YOUR TAIL,

03:05.228 --> 03:06.577
AND NOW YOU'RE
SWAPPING SPIT WITH HER.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.013
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT KISSING IS.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.406
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT BRUCE WENT THROUGH,

03:09.450 --> 03:10.886
WHY BATMAN
PUSHED PEOPLE AWAY.

03:10.929 --> 03:13.367
YOU REALIZE, THE MOMENT
ANYONE KNOWS BATWOMAN

03:13.410 --> 03:15.586
CARES ABOUT SOPHIE, IT PUTS
A TARGET ON HER BACK.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.588
SHE BECOMES
A LIABILITY.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.547
NOBODY NEEDS
TO FIND OUT.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.897
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY WON'T, KATE.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.076
HEE HEE! HA!

03:27.119 --> 03:29.644
SHE TOTALLY JUST
TEXTED YOU, DIDN'T SHE?

03:29.687 --> 03:32.081
SHE WANTS TO MEET
AT MY PLACE LATER.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.474

"IN A MOTEL PARKING LOT

04:01.676 --> 04:05.288
WHA--I'M SORRY.
THIS IS MY OBITUARY?

04:05.332 --> 04:08.422
"MENTALLY DERANGED
LEADER"?

04:08.465 --> 04:10.859
THAT'S MY SYNOPSIS,

04:10.902 --> 04:13.775
A TINY, LITTLE BLURB
BELOW THE FOLD?

04:13.818 --> 04:18.779
I SURVIVED CAPTIVITY
FOR 11 YEARS,

04:18.822 --> 04:22.610
ESCAPED, AND ENACTED
THE PERFECT REVENGE.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.440
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

04:26.483 --> 04:28.572
WANTED TO GET
A GOOD SHOT OF HIM.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.404
THAT'S NOT THE FACE
I SEE IN MY NIGHTMARES,

04:34.448 --> 04:38.278
BUT I'D RECOGNIZE
THAT PIPE ANYWHERE,

04:38.321 --> 04:42.107
EVEN IN THE DARK.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.805
IT'S HIM.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.938
AS YOU KNOW,
SOME WACKO DUBBED

04:46.982 --> 04:49.289
THE EXECUTIONER BLEW
A HOLE IN THE CITY'S

04:49.332 --> 04:50.899
CORRUPT COURT SYSTEM
A FEW MONTHS BACK...

04:50.942 --> 04:52.988
THEN I BLEW A HOLE IN HIM.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

04:53.031 --> 04:54.859
FORCED THE D.A.'s OFFICE
TO REOPEN A BUNCH

04:54.903 --> 04:56.557
OF HIS OLD CASES
AND FUNNEL THEM

04:56.600 --> 04:59.255
THROUGH A NEW JUDGE, BUT
YOU KNOW THIS NEW JUDGE--

04:59.299 --> 05:01.953
DAVIS WELLINGTON,
CROWS CONTRACTS

05:01.997 --> 05:03.433
DATING BACK TO 2004.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.392
MY CLIENT HOPES THAT
YOU WILL CALL THE JUDGE

05:05.435 --> 05:07.350
AND GET HIM TO
MOVE HIS CASE UP.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.439
HA HA! WHY
WOULD I DO THAT?

05:09.483 --> 05:14.444
BECAUSE MY CLIENT'S
REGGIE HARRIS...

05:14.488 --> 05:18.318
AND YOU OWE HIM
YOUR LIFE.

05:22.452 --> 05:23.845
THANK YOU.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.716
YOU'RE BETTER TO ME
ALIVE, PUPPY DOG.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.588
REGGIE
IS AN OPPORTUNIST

05:27.631 --> 05:28.980
USING THIS
CABAL NONSENSE

05:29.024 --> 05:30.634
AS A "GET OUT
OF JAIL FREE" CARD.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.767
HE CONFESSED TO
GUNNING DOWN LUCIUS FOX

05:32.810 --> 05:34.464
IN A C-STORE ROBBERY.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.162
THAT CONFESSION WAS COERCED
BY A CORRUPT GCPD COP.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.338
IT'S NOT
A CROWS PROBLEM.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.817
YET.

05:39.861 --> 05:43.386

05:43.430 --> 05:45.475

ABOUT THIS PLACE,

05:45.519 --> 05:48.435
CROWS HAVE SOME
SECRETS OF THEIR OWN.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.569
THAT ALMOST SOUNDED
LIKE A THREAT.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.226
IT IS.

05:57.269 --> 06:00.229
LET'S NOT TURN IT
INTO MORE.

06:00.272 --> 06:01.839
CALL THE JUDGE.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.493
GET HIM TO MOVE
REGGIE'S COURT DATE UP,

06:03.537 --> 06:04.842

I.E., ME, MY BRAND, MY IMAGE.

08:45.437 --> 08:48.440
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON THAT.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.877
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.270
THEY HAD NO BUDGET
FOR THIS PHOTO SHOOT,

08:52.314 --> 08:54.969

TALK ABOUT
THE UNKINDEST CUT.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.603
SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER
KIMBERLY WRIGHT WAS THE VICTIM

10:03.646 --> 10:06.127
OF A BRUTAL FACE-SLASHING
LAST NIGHT.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.739
GCPD SUSPECT THIS IS NOW THE
SECOND SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER

10:09.783 --> 10:12.699
ATTACKED
BY THE SERIAL SLASHIONISTA.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.178
TALK TO ME, GOTHAM.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.920
WHERE'S THE DISLIKE BUTTON
WHEN YOU NEED IT?

10:16.964 --> 10:18.835
HOW'D IT GO
WITH SOPHIE?

10:18.879 --> 10:21.621
SOPHIE. UH--AHEM.
UH, WELL, SHE--

10:21.664 --> 10:23.666
IT WAS REALLY COLD,
AND IT WAS

10:23.710 --> 10:25.450
A BIT HARD TO HEAR,
AND THEN HER MOM

10:25.494 --> 10:26.843
JUST SHOWED UP
OUT OF NOWHERE.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.150
SO "DOG ATE
MY BREAKUP"?

10:29.193 --> 10:32.806
THERE'S A LUNATIC WITH
A BOX CUTTER TARGETING KIDS.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.156
WE NEED TO FOCUS.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.679
ALREADY ON IT.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.072
KIMBERLY WRIGHT
DESCRIBED HER ATTACKER

10:38.115 --> 10:39.726
AS "A WOMAN IN HER 20s

10:39.769 --> 10:41.075
WHO WORE A HOODIE
AND A SURGICAL MASK."

10:41.118 --> 10:43.338
YEAH. THAT'S WHY
THE GCPD CAN'T I.D. HER.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.122
INTERESTINGLY,
NEITHER OF THE VICTIMS

10:45.166 --> 10:46.776
HAD ANY STAB WOUNDS
ON THEIR BODIES.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.169
SHE WENT
AFTER THEIR FACE.

10:48.212 --> 10:51.520
THEIR FACE IS THEIR
BRAND, THEIR BUSINESS.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.435
THIS IS PERSONAL.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.046
WHERE YOU OFF TO?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.353
TO SEE THE ONLY
INSTAFACE I CARE ABOUT.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.009
YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S ALL
MY FEED IS TALKING ABOUT.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.663
EVEN KYLIE Q
IS THREATENING

11:03.706 --> 11:05.795
TO GO WEB-SILENT
OUT OF RESPECT.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.667
THANK YOU,
DOCTOR.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.538
ARE YOU OK?

11:09.581 --> 11:11.975
I MEAN, I BARELY
KNEW KIMBERLY,

11:12.019 --> 11:14.891
BUT STILL,
IT'S PRETTY FREAKY,

11:14.935 --> 11:17.677
AND--DON'T WORRY--
MY FANBASE LEFT

11:17.720 --> 11:19.722
WHEN MY STEPDAD
SUPPOSEDLY KILLED MY MOM,

11:19.766 --> 11:22.203
SO I AM HARDLY
WORTH THE DATA.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.596
GOOD, NOT ABOUT
THE FANBASE THING.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.250
THAT SUCKS.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.252
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE
IN THAT CIRCLE

11:28.296 --> 11:29.689
THAT COULD BE
A TARGET?

11:29.732 --> 11:31.081
WELL, IT DEPENDS
ON WHO YOU ASK.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.517
I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT KIMBERLY WRIGHT

11:32.561 --> 11:34.084
HAS MILEY McGINN'S
NOSE.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.825
EXCEPT ME,
APPARENTLY.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.567
SAME CORRECTIVE SURGERY--
SHAPE, SLOPE, LENGTH.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.525
I MEAN,
IT'S A THING.

11:40.569 --> 11:41.962
PEOPLE WERE
EVEN WHISPERING,

11:42.005 --> 11:44.094
MAYBE MILEY HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE ATTACK,

11:44.138 --> 11:46.053
PISSED THAT KIMBERLY
STOLE HER NOSE,

11:46.096 --> 11:47.532
BUT IF YOU THINK
ABOUT IT,

11:47.576 --> 11:49.056
MILEY COPIED
MIA'S CHEEKBONES,

11:49.099 --> 11:50.840
AND MIA AND XENA
HAVE THE SAME CHIN,

11:50.884 --> 11:53.016
WHICH I BELIEVE BELONGED
TO ARIANA AT ONE POINT.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.105
ANYWAY, I AM SURE
THERE IS A WHO'S WHO

11:55.149 --> 11:57.107
OF POTENTIAL VICTIMS
IN DR. CAMPBELL'S

11:57.151 --> 11:58.718
WAITING ROOM
AS WE SPEAK.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.284
-DR. ETHAN CAMPBELL?
-YEAH.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.199
THE ONLY PLASTIC
SURGEON IN THE CITY

12:02.243 --> 12:05.202
WORTH GOING TO,
NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW.

12:05.246 --> 12:08.597
ACTUALLY, IF YOU'RE
LOOKING INTO THIS

12:08.640 --> 12:10.642
BECAUSE YOU OWN
A REAL ESTATE FIRM

12:10.686 --> 12:12.775
AND THESE WOMEN
ARE MOST LIKELY

12:12.819 --> 12:13.994
FUTURE
PROPERTY BUYERS...

12:14.037 --> 12:15.299
EXACTLY, YEAH.

12:15.343 --> 12:18.302
I'M AROUND IF YOU NEED
A SIDE...PERSON.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.478
I MEAN, I'M A D.M. AWAY
FROM HALF THESE GIRLS.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.871
I'D BE HAPPY
TO POKE AROUND

12:21.915 --> 12:23.307
FOR SOME CLUES
OR WHATEVER.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.353
IT'S PROBABLY SAFEST
IF YOU STAYED OUT OF IT,

12:25.396 --> 12:27.224
BUT I MIGHT ASK SOMEONE
TO DROP BY CAMPBELL

12:27.268 --> 12:28.748
AND JUST GIVE HIM
A HEADS-UP.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.097
I COULD DO IT.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.013
I MEAN, I'M A MED STUDENT
WHERE HE LECTURES,

12:33.056 --> 12:35.755
SO, NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

12:35.798 --> 12:37.408
MY VAST ARRAY
OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE

12:37.452 --> 12:41.108
COULD COME IN HANDY
IN ENDLESS SCENARIOS.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.980
I'M GOOD, MARY.
THANK YOU.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.461
OK. WELL,
I'M HAPPY TO HELP.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.246
BYE, MARY.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.165
REWIND.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.689
YOU AND YOUR
HUSBAND SEPARATE,

12:57.733 --> 13:01.389
AND YOU DIDN'T
THINK TO CALL ME?

13:01.432 --> 13:05.001
I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST
TO LET THE DUST SETTLE.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.655
WHERE'S MY PHONE?

13:06.698 --> 13:08.048
I'LL TELL TYLER
ALL THE WAYS

13:08.091 --> 13:09.353
HE'S MAKING THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF HIS LIFE.

13:09.397 --> 13:13.227
MOM, STOP.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

13:14.576 --> 13:17.231
-IT WAS ME.
-YOU?

13:17.274 --> 13:19.886
I, UM--

13:19.929 --> 13:21.713
I FELL OUT OF
LOVE WITH HIM.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.499
YOU FELL OUT OF LOVE
WITH A HANDSOME,

13:24.542 --> 13:26.240
DECORATED,
CAPABLE MAN

13:26.283 --> 13:29.112
WHO ALWAYS SENT ME
FLOWERS ON MY BIRTHDAY.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.289
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME
THE REAL STORY?

13:32.333 --> 13:35.727
MOM, THAT IS
THE REAL STORY.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.338
WELL, JACOB KANE
CALLED.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.166
HE TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR SUSPENSION.

13:39.209 --> 13:42.604
HEH, SO THAT'S
WHY YOU'RE IN TOWN.

13:42.647 --> 13:45.607
THIS ISN'T SOME MOTHERLY
"I MISSED YOU" VISIT.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.044
MORE OF A "PLEASE DON'T
END UP UNDER A BRIDGE" VISIT.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.481
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
PAY THE RENT?

13:50.525 --> 13:54.094
BY WORKING AT A PLACE
THAT ALIGNS WITH MY VALUES.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.444
I DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE
WITH THE CROWS' WAY

13:56.487 --> 13:57.967
OF DOING THINGS
ANYMORE.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.360
OH, PLEASE DON'T
TELL ME YOU WISH

13:59.403 --> 14:01.101
THEY WERE MORE
LIKE THE GCPD.

14:01.144 --> 14:04.626
NO, MORE LIKE
BATWOMAN.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.149
OHH...

14:06.193 --> 14:09.022
SHE IS SOMEONE WHO
REPRESENTS ALL OF GOTHAM--

14:09.065 --> 14:11.807
THE POOR, THE RICH,
AND IN BETWEEN--

14:11.851 --> 14:14.157
AND SHE'S SAVED MY LIFE
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.943
SHE IS A DAMN CRIMINAL
WHO GETS AWAY WITH IT.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.683
YOU NEVER HAD
A PROBLEM WITH BATMAN.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.859
YOU THOUGHT
HE WAS CUTE.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.512
BATMAN WAS DIFFERENT.

14:21.556 --> 14:24.167
HOW, MOM? HOW WAS
BATMAN DIFFERENT?

14:24.211 --> 14:28.998
HE REPRESENTED VALUES
I ACTUALLY BELIEVED IN.

14:29.042 --> 14:32.915
YOU MEAN,
HE'S NOT GAY.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.357
HEY, I DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME,

14:40.401 --> 14:42.577
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY
MAKE THIS QUICK.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.492
YOU OK?

14:44.535 --> 14:46.929
MY MOM, SHE--

14:48.975 --> 14:50.715
I'M 28 YEARS OLD.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.588
I HAVE TWO DEGREES AND
OWN A CONDO ON A RIVER,

14:53.631 --> 14:55.546
AND I SPEND EVERY
WAKING MOMENT

14:55.590 --> 14:57.461
WONDERING IF
SHE'S PROUD OF ME.

14:57.505 --> 15:00.421
AND IF SHE WERE TO
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS--

15:00.464 --> 15:05.905
UPSIDE OF HAVING
TO HIDE IT--SHE WON'T.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.473
SO WHAT'S UP?

15:09.517 --> 15:11.519
I DID SOME DIGGING,
AND I THINK

15:11.562 --> 15:13.738
THE GOTHAM SERIAL SLASHER
IS TARGETING PATIENTS

15:13.782 --> 15:16.393
FROM A PLASTIC SURGEON BY
THE NAME OF ETHAN CAMPBELL.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.699
I KNOW HIM.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.744
HIS AFFIDAVIT CLEARED MY
BOSS OF MURDER CHARGES.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.181
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.226
I NEED YOU TO FIND OUT
WHAT HE KNOWS.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.882
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY.
THE CROWS SUSPENDED ME.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.928
DOES CAMPBELL
KNOW THAT?

15:32.061 --> 15:33.671
THE LAST VICTIM
OF THE SLASHER

15:33.715 --> 15:36.239
WAS ALSO A PATIENT
OF YOURS--MIA CORTEZ.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.675
WE'RE WORRIED
THE NEXT VICTIM

15:37.719 --> 15:39.503
COULD BE A NAME
IN ONE OF THOSE FILES.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.505
KIMBERLY WRIGHT TOLD EVERY ONE
OF HER 10 MILLION FOLLOWERS

15:41.549 --> 15:46.075
ABOUT HER NOSE JOB, SO IF
IT'S A CASE OF JEALOUSY,

15:46.119 --> 15:48.991
YOU HAVE A LOT OF NAMES
TO SIFT THROUGH.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.558
ONE THEORY IS
SHE'S TARGETING

15:50.601 --> 15:52.777
COPYCAT SURGERIES.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.040
HAVE YOU EVER--

15:54.083 --> 15:56.651
CUT A SMILE INTO
A PATIENT'S FACE?

15:56.694 --> 16:00.698
NO, AGENT MOORE.
I CERTAINLY HAVE NOT.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.448
THEN MAYBE SHE'S NOT
TARGETING COPYCATS.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.451
MAYBE SHE'S
MAKING COPYCATS.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.323
BY INFLICTING
HER VICTIMS

16:16.366 --> 16:18.281
WITH THE SAME
SCARS SHE HAS?

16:18.325 --> 16:19.848
HAVE YOU EVER
TREATED A WOMAN

16:19.891 --> 16:21.850
WITH THIS TYPE
OF SCARRING?

16:21.893 --> 16:26.028
UH, ACTUALLY, YES,
8 YEARS AGO.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.464
A TEENAGE GIRL
WAS BROUGHT TO ME

16:27.508 --> 16:30.641
WITH A PSYCHIATRIC RAP SHEET
AS LONG AS MY ARM,

16:30.685 --> 16:35.820
HAD THE WORST SELF-INFLICTED
SCARS I'VE EVER SEEN.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.127
SHE CUT
HER OWN FACE?

16:38.171 --> 16:40.303
YES. SHE DID.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.830
DUELA DENT. WHAT
CAN YOU FIND ON HER?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.572
LUKE, ON COMMS: DAUGHTER
OF EVELYN, FATHER UNKNOWN.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.966
HER UNCLE HARVEY
IS A BELOVED A.D.A.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.620
WAIT. HERE'S SOMETHING.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.361
SHE WAS JUST RELEASED FROM
A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.058
HOW DID YOU
GET HER NAME?

16:56.102 --> 16:57.668
BAT SOURCES, OK?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.714
WOULD THOSE BAT SOURCES
BE OF THE TALL, DARK,

16:59.757 --> 17:01.933
AND GIRLFRIEND-
MATERIAL VARIETY?

17:01.977 --> 17:04.153
I'M CHOOSING
TO IGNORE THAT.

17:04.196 --> 17:07.503
I FOUND SOMETHING.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.641
IT'S HER HIT LIST.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.910
RUN THE NAME
MYRTIS DINKER.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.130
MYRTIS DINKER?

17:24.173 --> 17:27.394
NOPE. NOTHING,
NO MYRTIS DINKER.

17:27.436 --> 17:32.312
OH, I HAVE AN IDEA.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.750
PRESS THE RED BUTTON
ON YOUR RIGHT GAUNTLET.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.493
OH.

17:39.536 --> 17:43.105
SORRY.
YOUR LEFT GAUNTLET.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.372
THAT WAS
YOUR UPGRADE?

17:49.416 --> 17:51.374
COWL CAM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:51.418 --> 17:52.897
USE THIS WITHOUT
MY PERMISSION,

17:52.941 --> 17:54.508
AND I WILL FIND A NEW PLACE
TO PUT MY BATARANG.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.293
YEAH. COPY THAT.
RUNNING THE IMAGE NOW.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.255
AND?

18:03.604 --> 18:06.302
I'M STILL WORKING
OUT THE BUGS. JUST--

18:45.298 --> 18:47.561
YOU'RE OK. IT'S OK.

18:47.604 --> 18:52.174
IT'S OK. I'M GONNA
GET YOU HELP. JUST--

18:54.568 --> 18:56.613
-HUH! HYAH!
-UHH!

18:56.657 --> 18:59.834
COME ANY CLOSER, AND I TURN
MY MOM INTO A PEZ DISPENSER.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.444
DUELA, YOU DO NOT
NEED TO DO THIS.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.750
AND SHE DIDN'T
HAVE TO FORCE ME

19:02.793 --> 19:04.317
TO BE SOMEONE I'M NOT,
SOMEONE I HATE,

19:04.360 --> 19:05.883
SOMEONE I CAN'T
EVEN LOOK AT,

19:05.927 --> 19:08.495
SO I'M GONNA GO, AND
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A MOP.

19:08.538 --> 19:11.933
NO! NO.

19:11.976 --> 19:14.153
STAY WITH ME.
STAY WITH ME.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.634
IT'S GONNA BE OK.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

19:21.203 --> 19:25.903
I HAVE SPENT HOURS UPON HOURS
COOKING UP ALL THE WAYS

19:25.947 --> 19:29.298
THAT I COULD TORTURE
THAT VILE MAN.

19:29.342 --> 19:33.215
NOW THAT HE'S RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE, I--

19:33.259 --> 19:36.175
YOU'RE BLOCKED.

19:36.218 --> 19:40.483
EXACTLY,
DR. MALONE. HA HA!

19:40.527 --> 19:45.488
I AM BLOCKED.
AHH...

19:46.402 --> 19:48.361
OH, DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.927
I MEAN, IT'S
A NORMAL REACTION.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.408
VICTIMS HELD IN PHYSICAL
AND EMOTIONAL CAPTIVITY

19:52.452 --> 19:54.497
OFTENTIMES REVERT
BACK TO THE AGE

19:54.541 --> 19:57.544
THEY WERE HELD WHEN
FACING THEIR CAPTOR.

19:57.587 --> 20:01.809
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I DON'T FIND CLOSURE?

20:01.852 --> 20:03.680
NO, OF COURSE NOT,

20:03.724 --> 20:05.595
BUT YOU CLEARLY HAVE
UNRESOLVED FEAR.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.599
MY FEAR IS THAT I WILL
KILL HIM INSTANTLY,

20:09.643 --> 20:14.213
FORGETTING TO RELISH
IN HIS SLOW

20:14.256 --> 20:16.650
AND PAINFUL DEMISE.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.478
THOSE ARE JUST YOUR
DEFENSES TALKING.

20:18.521 --> 20:22.873
I DON'T HAVE DEFENSES.
HA HA HA! MM...

20:22.917 --> 20:24.745
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

20:24.788 --> 20:27.704
IN MY PROFESSIONAL
OPINION,

20:27.748 --> 20:30.533
I SEE YOU PUTTING UP
A HARD, BLUSTERY EXTERIOR,

20:30.577 --> 20:32.883
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

20:32.927 --> 20:35.451
YOU ARE STILL
TERRIFIED OF THIS MAN.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.975
YOU ARE STILL JUST
A LITTLE GIRL,

20:38.019 --> 20:40.456
AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
CONFRONT HIM FACE TO FACE

20:40.500 --> 20:42.632
THAT HE WILL FIND
A WAY TO REGAIN

20:42.676 --> 20:46.549
THAT POWER OVER YOU
ONCE AGAIN.

20:49.987 --> 20:54.731
SO THEN SHRINK ME, HMM?
WHAT DO I DO?

20:54.775 --> 20:57.995
I SUGGEST
AN EMOTIONAL SHIELD,

20:58.039 --> 21:00.563
A THIRD PERSON THAT
ACTS AS A BUFFER

21:00.607 --> 21:03.566
BETWEEN YOU
AND THE ABUSER.

21:03.610 --> 21:08.441
WELL, YOU HAVE BEEN
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL,

21:08.484 --> 21:10.921
DR. MALONE. HA HA!

21:10.965 --> 21:13.968
I DO WISH WE COULD'VE
MADE THIS A WEEKLY AFFAIR.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.536
OH! NO. PLEASE. NO.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.320
I WON'T TELL ANYONE
YOU'RE ALIVE.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.191
PLEASE. I WON'T
TELL ANYONE.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.585
PLEASE! PLEASE DON'T.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.936
I WON'T TELL
ANYONE!

21:33.117 --> 21:34.684
WELL, WELL,

21:34.728 --> 21:36.860
DR. FIX-ME THREATENED
WITH A LAWSUIT

21:36.904 --> 21:40.037
BY A 16-YEAR-OLD
WHO DID NOT CONSENT

21:40.081 --> 21:44.041
TO THE RESTORATIVE PLASTIC
SURGERY HE PERFORMED ON HER.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.481
HMM.

21:48.524 --> 21:51.484
WHAT AN INTERESTING,
LITTLE PSYCHOPATH.

22:05.454 --> 22:08.979
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA KEEP ME HERE?

22:10.241 --> 22:12.679
AS LONG AS IT TAKES FOR YOU
TO COME TO YOUR SENSES.

22:12.722 --> 22:17.466
HA HA HA!
ALICE WILL FIND ME.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.904
MM. ALICE IS DEAD.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.386
NO.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.997
I SHOT HER.

22:27.041 --> 22:30.827
NO. NO.

22:34.178 --> 22:35.484
NO. NO.

22:35.528 --> 22:38.313
SON...
NO. NO.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.663
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HER.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.622
ALL SHE EVER DID
WAS PUT YOUR LIFE

22:42.665 --> 22:45.538
IN DANGER TO ADVANCE
HER OWN AGENDA.

22:45.581 --> 22:50.412
ALL I'VE DONE...
IS PROTECT YOU...

22:52.240 --> 22:54.721
FROM THE CRUELTY
OF THE WORLD.

22:54.764 --> 22:58.028
THE ONLY THING
CRUEL

22:58.072 --> 23:01.815
IN MY WORLD
IS YOU.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.650
YOU THINK
THAT WAY NOW,

23:10.693 --> 23:15.568
BUT IN TIME, YOU'LL
COME TO SEE THE TRUTH.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.874
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:17.918 --> 23:19.615
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:19.659 --> 23:21.791
WHAT ARE--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:25.926 --> 23:27.797
YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME, SIR?

23:27.841 --> 23:29.886
OUR FAVORITE
AMBULANCE CHASER BOBBY REEVES

23:29.930 --> 23:31.410
STOPPED BY.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.759
HE'S POKING AROUND
A MURDER CASE

23:32.802 --> 23:36.415
YOUR TEAM
RAN POINT ON.

23:36.458 --> 23:39.592
YEAH, HARD TO FORGET.

23:39.635 --> 23:40.984
HARRIS GUNNED DOWN
LUCIUS FOX

23:41.028 --> 23:42.725
AND A CASHIER
AT A SIP & DASH.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.423
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

23:44.466 --> 23:45.772
WE TURNED HIM OVER
TO THE GCPD.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.904
YEAH, TO STU DONNELLY,
THE OFFICER ACCUSED

23:47.948 --> 23:51.168
OF COERCING CONFESSIONS
IN AT LEAST 21 CASES.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.910
WE HANDED A LOT OF PERPS
OVER TO DONNELLY, COMMANDER.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.912
ARE WE SAYING
THEY'RE ALL INNOCENT?

23:55.956 --> 23:57.871
YOU DON'T FIND IT UNUSUAL
THAT THE SIP & DASH'S

23:57.914 --> 23:59.742
4 SECURITY CAMERAS
WEREN'T WORKING

23:59.786 --> 24:01.875
IN THE 5-HOUR WINDOW WHEN
THE ROBBERY TOOK PLACE?

24:01.918 --> 24:05.008
ONLY THING I FIND UNUSUAL
IS LUCIUS FOX WAS A HERO

24:05.052 --> 24:07.097
TO THE CITY AND
PEOPLE ARE TRYING

24:07.141 --> 24:10.449
TO SET
HIS KILLER FREE.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.803
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU WERE GONNA

24:16.846 --> 24:19.283
HIT ME UP ABOUT
THE SLASHER CASE.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.850
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

24:20.894 --> 24:23.462
BECAUSE I AM SMART
AND PERCEPTIVE,

24:23.505 --> 24:25.855
TWO TRAITS PEOPLE
OFTEN OVERLOOK.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.031
ANYWAY, I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU COULD HELP ME

24:28.075 --> 24:29.946
I.D. SOMEONE, SOMEONE
THAT DOESN'T POP UP

24:29.990 --> 24:31.861
ON MY FACIAL
RECOGNITION SYSTEM.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.341
MM-HMM.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.822
OH, THAT'S
VERONICA MAY.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.388
-YOU SURE?
-YEAH.

24:37.432 --> 24:38.912
APPARENTLY, SHE CHANGED
HER NAME AFTER HIGH SCHOOL,

24:38.955 --> 24:41.567
AND IF MY NAME
WAS MYRTIS DINKER,

24:41.610 --> 24:44.570
I WOULD, TOO, AND I'M
GUESSING THE REASON

24:44.613 --> 24:46.528
WHY HER FACE STUMPED
YOUR BAT TECH IS BECAUSE

24:46.572 --> 24:49.749
THAT'S NOT HER NOSE
ANYMORE...OR HER CHIN.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.446
ANY IDEA HOW
I CAN FIND HER?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.492
WELL, SHE PRETTY MUCH LIVES
ON BOARD THE MAY-MOBILE.

24:53.535 --> 24:54.754
THE WHAT?

24:54.797 --> 24:56.146
IT'S PART
MAKEOVER TRUCK,

24:56.190 --> 24:58.235
PART ROLLING BILLBOARD
FOR HER MAKEUP LINE.

24:58.279 --> 25:02.370
JUST LOOK FOR THE GAUDIEST
THING ON THE ROAD.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.807
KATE, ON COMMS: WE NEED TO
FIND THAT COSMETICS TRUCK.

25:04.851 --> 25:07.593
I APPRECIATE THAT,
BUT A TRUCK IN GOTHAM,

25:07.636 --> 25:09.812
KIND OF A NEEDLE
IN A HAYSTACK.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.640
THE NEEDLE
IS HOT PINK.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.163
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.991
LET ME RUN A COLOR FILTER
ON THE SATELLITE.

25:17.733 --> 25:20.649
OK. WE'VE GOT
A ICE CREAM TRUCK,

25:20.693 --> 25:22.608
AN UNFORTUNATE
PAINT JOB ON A LAMBO.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.874
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

25:39.059 --> 25:42.671
DUELA'S BEEN HERE,
NO SIGN OF VERONICA.

25:43.933 --> 25:47.023
HOLD UP. I THINK
I GOT COMPANY.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.897
SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.420
NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.987
I'VE BEEN LISTENING IN
TO THE CROWS' RADIO.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.336
THEY'LL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.685
I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL I FIND

25:56.729 --> 25:58.382
EVERY SINGLE PERSON
THAT WAS IN THAT TRUCK.

25:58.426 --> 26:02.125
LOOKS LIKE DUELA FORCED
THEM INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.040
WHY HERE?

26:05.999 --> 26:08.567
UH, VERONICA'S SKIN CARE LINE IS
MADE AT A PLANT DOWN THE ROAD.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.612
YOU BY THE TRUCK,
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR NOW.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.092
WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

26:12.135 --> 26:14.616
GET OUT OF HERE NOW.
COME ON.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.575
-GET ON.
-WAIT. WHAT?

26:16.618 --> 26:19.012
GET ON.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.739
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

26:52.567 --> 26:54.438
OH, I'M SORRY.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.875
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

26:55.918 --> 26:57.659
WITH PEOPLE STEALING
MEDICAL SUPPLIES?

26:57.703 --> 27:01.271
BECAUSE, UM...HI.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.317
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR
HOW I FELT ABOUT YOU

27:03.360 --> 27:04.710
WHEN I LEFT YOU
TO DIE.

27:04.753 --> 27:07.669
YOU DID, BUT THEN
I SAVED YOUR LIFE,

27:07.713 --> 27:11.151
AND NOW
YOU OWE ME, SO--

27:11.194 --> 27:12.892
DID BATWOMAN
NOT TELL YOU?

27:12.935 --> 27:14.284
NOT TELL ME WHAT?

27:14.328 --> 27:15.590
AFTER NOCTURNA
DRAINED YOUR BLOOD,

27:15.634 --> 27:16.896
YOU WERE
ON DEATH'S DOOR.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.593
I FOUND YOU AND
REVIVED YOU WITH MY OWN,

27:18.637 --> 27:22.597
MEANING I LITERALLY PUMPED
LIFE BACK INTO YOUR VEINS.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.295
UGH, I NEED
A BLEACH TRANSFUSION.

27:25.339 --> 27:28.647
OH, I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A THANK YOU.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.257
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT?

27:30.300 --> 27:34.435
LET'S JUST SAY IT WAS
MORE ABOUT BATWOMAN

27:34.478 --> 27:37.830
AND LESS ABOUT YOU.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.702
THANKS
FOR THE GOODS.

27:40.746 --> 27:44.619
DO YOU KNOW
WHO SHE IS?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.708
BATWOMAN?

27:46.752 --> 27:49.406
OF COURSE I DO.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.671
OH, DO YOU NOT?

27:52.714 --> 27:54.673
SAD.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.023
GUESS YOU TWO AREN'T
REALLY PALS AFTER ALL.

27:57.066 --> 27:59.460
HMM.

28:01.897 --> 28:05.422
VERONICA: AAH!

28:05.466 --> 28:08.774
AAH!

28:11.298 --> 28:14.954
DUELA, STOP.
PLEASE LET ME DOWN.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.869
I'M HELPING YOU,
VERONICA--

28:16.912 --> 28:19.349
OH, I MEAN, MYRTIS.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.700
OH...

28:21.743 --> 28:23.353
OHH!

28:23.397 --> 28:26.095
OH, MY GOD, LOOK.
YOU MADE YOUR POINT, OK?

28:26.139 --> 28:28.837
I WASN'T A GREAT FRIEND
AFTER THE INCIDENT,

28:28.881 --> 28:31.013
BUT, HONESTLY,
I WAS AFRAID OF YOU.

28:31.057 --> 28:33.059
BECAUSE I WAS
FINALLY HAPPY?

28:33.102 --> 28:35.888
HAPPY PEOPLE DON'T
SLICE THEIR FACES OPEN.

28:35.931 --> 28:39.195
HA! WHAT
DO THEY DO, HMM,

28:39.239 --> 28:41.981
SHAVE A BONE
OFF THEIR NOSE,

28:42.024 --> 28:43.809
SLIT THEIR
EYELIDS OPEN,

28:43.852 --> 28:46.550
STAB NEEDLES
INTO THEIR LIPS?

28:46.594 --> 28:48.204
YOU KNOW,
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

28:48.248 --> 28:51.033
BETWEEN YOU AND ME IS THAT
I GOT INSTITUTIONALIZED

28:51.077 --> 28:53.166
AND YOU GOT FAMOUS.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.995
MY MOTHER WANTED ME
TO BE YOU.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.258
PUT ME DOWN,
YOU PSYCHO!

28:58.301 --> 29:00.782
IT'S TIME TO SHOW
THE WORLD WHAT I SEE

29:00.826 --> 29:03.872
WHEN I LOOK
AT VERONICA MAY.

29:03.916 --> 29:08.398
NO! DUELA, STOP!
PLEASE DON'T!

29:08.442 --> 29:10.357

36:45.246 --> 36:47.248
AND I WANT TO FIND
THAT AGAIN.

36:47.292 --> 36:51.034
OK. OK. THEN GO
FIND HIM, HONEY.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.036
GO FIND HIM.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.735
IT WASN'T A HIM, MOM.

36:57.824 --> 37:00.696
IT WAS A HER.

37:00.740 --> 37:04.352
FOR YEARS,
I KEPT IT A SECRET.

37:04.396 --> 37:07.225
I THOUGHT
I COULD HAVE BOTH--

37:07.268 --> 37:10.358
THE VERSION OF ME
THAT MY SCHOOL

37:10.402 --> 37:14.057
AND MY FAMILY
COULD BE PROUD OF

37:14.101 --> 37:17.887
AND THE VERSION OF ME
WHO KNEW WHO SHE WAS.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.498
OHH...

37:19.541 --> 37:23.066
♪ I TRY NOT
TO HOLD MY BREATH ♪

37:23.110 --> 37:28.550
SO THE GOOD LORD DIDN'T
MAKE IT HARD ENOUGH ON YOU,

37:28.594 --> 37:31.249
NOT ENOUGH TO BE
A WOMAN OF COLOR,

37:31.292 --> 37:33.816
NOT ENOUGH TO COME
FROM NOTHING,

37:33.860 --> 37:35.862
NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE
TO PROVE YOUR DAMN WORTH

37:35.905 --> 37:37.907
TO THE WORLD
EVERY TIME YOU WANT

37:37.951 --> 37:39.866
TO BE PART OF IT, HUH?

37:39.909 --> 37:42.477
YOU GOT TO ADD THIS
ON TOP OF IT?

37:42.521 --> 37:45.088
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS,

37:45.132 --> 37:47.917
JUST LIKE I DIDN'T ASK
FOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS,

37:47.961 --> 37:50.616
BUT EACH OF THEM
MAKE ME WHO I AM.

37:50.659 --> 37:54.097
AND WHY AM I ONLY
HEARING ABOUT IT NOW?

37:54.141 --> 37:55.925
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO LOOK AT ME

37:55.969 --> 37:57.666
THE WAY YOU'RE
LOOKING AT ME NOW.

37:57.710 --> 38:02.758
OH, SOPHIE, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT, SWEETHEART.

38:05.108 --> 38:09.287
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT
DISAPPOINTMENT TO LOOK LIKE?

38:13.073 --> 38:18.818
♪ WHY DID I BEND
WHEN I NEEDED... ♪

38:20.472 --> 38:22.387
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
HAD A LONG NIGHT.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.780
MORE LIKE
A REALLY LONG DAY.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.653
IF YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

38:27.696 --> 38:30.046
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING,

38:30.090 --> 38:32.484
YOU KNOW
I'M HERE, RIGHT?

38:32.527 --> 38:34.442
I...LOST A PIECE
OF REAL ESTATE

38:34.486 --> 38:36.226
I HAD MY HEART
SET ON,

38:36.270 --> 38:37.967
BUT WASN'T
THE RIGHT MOVE.

38:38.011 --> 38:40.361
TIMING WAS OFF.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.321
OH. HUH.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.498
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE DAY

38:46.541 --> 38:48.238
THAT YOU CAME
BACK TO GOTHAM?

38:48.282 --> 38:49.762
I THREW YOU THAT
WELCOME-HOME PARTY,

38:49.805 --> 38:51.503
AND THEN 6 HOURS LATER,
I WAS STITCHING UP

38:51.546 --> 38:53.200
YOUR SHOULDER,
TELLING YOU THAT

38:53.243 --> 38:55.202
I OWNED
AN ILLEGAL CLINIC.

38:55.245 --> 38:57.813
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

38:57.857 --> 39:00.729
IT NEVER ONCE
OCCURRED TO ME

39:00.773 --> 39:02.557
THAT YOU'D TELL
MY MOM OR YOUR DAD

39:02.601 --> 39:04.777
THAT I WAS LIVING
A DOUBLE LIFE

39:04.820 --> 39:07.432
OR THAT YOU'D TRY
TO SHUT ME DOWN

39:07.475 --> 39:09.434
OR TELL ME
I COULD GET SUED

39:09.477 --> 39:12.741
OR KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL
OR ARRESTED.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.618
I KNEW I DIDN'T
HAVE TO WORRY

39:19.661 --> 39:22.490
ABOUT YOU JUDGING ME

39:22.534 --> 39:26.538
BECAUSE
I TRUSTED YOU...

39:28.540 --> 39:31.020
SO I HOPE ONE DAY
THAT YOU FEEL

39:31.064 --> 39:33.153
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.754
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

40:10.582 --> 40:14.977
FOR YOU
TO DROP THE ACT

40:15.021 --> 40:17.240
AND THE FACE.

40:17.284 --> 40:19.939
UH!

40:25.901 --> 40:28.426
MM...

40:29.427 --> 40:34.562
I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER
HAVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

40:34.606 --> 40:37.826
BUT I WAS WRONG.

40:37.870 --> 40:43.789
I SEE THIS FACE EVERY
NIGHT AS I GO TO SLEEP

40:43.832 --> 40:46.574
AND EVERY MORNING
AS I WAKE,

40:46.618 --> 40:49.795
AND SOMETIMES
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES

40:49.838 --> 40:51.884
AND SHAKE TOO LONG.

40:51.927 --> 40:55.365
IF YOU'RE GONNA
KILL ME, DO IT.

40:55.409 --> 40:58.804
KILL ME.
GET IT OVER WITH.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.936
SHH SHH.

41:00.980 --> 41:04.766
WE MUSTN'T SPEAK
SUCH NONSENSE.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.160
I WOULD
NEVER KILL YOU,

41:07.203 --> 41:10.772
AT LEAST NOT WITH THESE
NIMBLE, LITTLE FINGERS.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.471
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

41:13.514 --> 41:15.690
MY BROTHER MOUSE.

41:15.734 --> 41:19.172
SURELY, YOU HAVE HIM,
AND I WANT HIM,

41:19.215 --> 41:21.130
SO WHERE IS HE?

41:21.174 --> 41:24.003
HA HA HA!

41:24.046 --> 41:27.659
WHY IS THAT
SO FUNNY?

41:27.702 --> 41:30.662
-HA HA HA!
-WHAT?

41:30.705 --> 41:33.969
YEAH. YEAH.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.494
I WILL TELL YOU
WHERE YOU CAN FIND

41:36.537 --> 41:39.540
YOUR...

41:39.584 --> 41:42.630
PRECIOUS MOUSE.

42:20.059 --> 42:21.974
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
