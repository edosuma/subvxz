00:36.645 --> 00:39.169
No, but in a strange chain
of events,

00:39.213 --> 00:42.520
I-I think I have
your cell phone.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.826
That isn't mine.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.176
Are you sure?
Because we have...

00:46.220 --> 00:49.266
I'm sure. Have a nice day.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.007
Something's off.

I told you, it's not my phone.Yes, we know.

01:02.453 --> 01:05.152
It's just that we're, uh, new
to the neighborhood and we were

01:05.194 --> 01:07.458
wondering if you knew
of any good restaurants nearby.

01:09.417 --> 01:13.943
There's a diner at the end
of Pua Road. Goodbye.

01:13.986 --> 01:14.987
MAGNUM:
Thank you.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.556
There's definitely
someone else in there.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.645
Yeah, and they can't like us
breathing down their necks.

Like most people, I'm in a group text with my best buds.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.644
Ours is called
"The Ohana Thread."

02:02.687 --> 02:05.168
It started out with
me, Rick, and TC,

02:05.212 --> 02:07.388
but over time,
Kumu and Higgins joined in.

02:07.431 --> 02:10.217
We usually just text
random videos,

02:10.259 --> 02:14.090
like kids ranting on novocaine
or a sneezing baby panda.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.092
So when Rick sent us a message

02:16.136 --> 02:17.920
asking all of us
to meet him this morning,

02:17.963 --> 02:20.488

it had to be important.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.891
How was your flight?

02:32.935 --> 02:34.284
Oh, you know,

02:34.328 --> 02:36.852
brilliant. 20-hour flight
from London to Oahu

02:36.895 --> 02:38.593
was just the bee's knees.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.247
Wow, you even sound
more British.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.298
Right on time.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.170
Honestly, Magnum, I had to fly
through ten time zones

02:50.213 --> 02:52.128
to get here and I still arrived
before you did.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.130
Hey, you know
the lead singer of the band

02:54.174 --> 02:55.610
is always the last one
to arrive.

The Ohana Thread in the flesh.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.484
Please, follow me.
I got something to show you.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.704
Come on, get in here.Let me get that for you.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.272
Oh, thanks.

03:05.315 --> 03:08.188
So...

03:08.231 --> 03:11.234
Is that a question
or are you just struggling

03:11.278 --> 03:13.193
to find words to follow?

03:13.236 --> 03:15.325
How did your big MI6 meeting go?

03:15.369 --> 03:17.153
Smashing.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.112
Smashing?
Are you being sarcastic?

03:20.156 --> 03:22.027
Because I-I can never tell
with you.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.855
It was not sarcastic.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.596
See, that sounded
sarcastic.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.295
I honestly don't know
the difference.
Yeah.

RICK: Check it out,
my friends.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.822
The last original
tiki bar on the island.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.346
This place was around
before Hawaii

03:36.390 --> 03:38.261
was even a state.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.176
And after
all these years,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.960
the owner is
ready to retire.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.179
So what do you guys think?

03:43.223 --> 03:46.748
This is kitschy,
but why are we here?

03:46.791 --> 03:49.229
That, my friend, is the
2 million dollar question--

03:49.272 --> 03:51.927
quite literally, because
the place is up for sale.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.407
Wait, are you...

03:53.450 --> 03:55.365
Devilishly handsome? Yes, I am.
Thank you for noticing.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.062
And I'm also broke

03:57.106 --> 04:00.370
because I put down a deposit
to try and buy the place.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.416
No way!

04:02.459 --> 04:06.768
So you are the owner
of La Mariana now?

04:06.811 --> 04:08.683
Not yet. The deposit
was to hold the property.

04:08.726 --> 04:11.773
I still need some financial
backing to pull it off.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.645
Hm, good friend needs
financial backing?

04:14.689 --> 04:18.214
[gasps] This has Robin Masters'
name all over it.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.172
No, no, no, no.
Robin has given me enough.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.305
Well, I could throw you
some extra dough.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.133
Magnum, I don't think
the bank's going to accept

04:24.176 --> 04:25.482
chocolate coins
covered in tinfoil.

04:25.526 --> 04:29.356
All I'm saying is that
whatever I have is yours.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.748
KUMU:
Me, too. I mean,

04:30.792 --> 04:32.620
I'd have to move
a few things around, but...

04:32.663 --> 04:34.317
No, thank you, guys.
I appreciate it.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.189
It means a lot, but, uh, I'm
not looking for any handouts.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.279
In fact, I have a meeting
with the bank later today

04:39.322 --> 04:40.715
to try and buy the joint.

04:40.758 --> 04:43.326
Just kind of wanted
your opinion.[piano playing]

04:47.025 --> 04:48.897
He comes with the place.
Nicky, these are my buddies.

TC, and Kumu.

Hey, guys.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.337
It's nice to meet you, brother.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.426
Man, you didn't tell me
you had a piano man.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.994
This place is pretty dope.RICK: It is dope,

04:59.037 --> 05:01.344
and I can't wait to return it
to its former glory.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.347
It just, uh, just needs a little
sprucing up a bit, you know?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.262
Yeah, well, does
that plan include me?

05:06.306 --> 05:10.222
'Cause I don't know if this
old dog could do any new tricks.

05:10.266 --> 05:13.095
Oh, Nicky, come on, you're not
old, you're just vintage, baby.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.663
Vintage, I like that.[laughter]

05:26.456 --> 05:29.198
Well, just gonna sit there,

05:29.241 --> 05:31.374
or you gonna tell me about
your big hoity-toity meeting?

05:31.418 --> 05:34.334
[sighs] What happened
in that meeting, Magnum,

05:34.377 --> 05:36.118
is solely my business.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.468
Anyway, I could tell you,
but then I would have to...

05:38.512 --> 05:40.035
You'd have to kill me,
is that it?

05:40.078 --> 05:42.298
No, then I'd have to
listen to you beg me

05:42.342 --> 05:45.127
to be your partner
as opposed to rejoining MI6.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.390
So you haven't decided yet?

05:47.434 --> 05:50.132
Not yet. They want an answer
by the end of next week.

05:50.175 --> 05:53.396
Just so you know, there will be
no begging on my part.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.658
That's easy
for you to say.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.181
You don't know
what they're offering.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.792
I don't care what they're
offering. It doesn't matter.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.359
You can either work with this

05:59.402 --> 06:00.577
massive, global
intelligence service,

06:00.621 --> 06:02.144
or you can stay on the island

06:02.187 --> 06:04.146
and work up close
and personal with clients.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.669
I mean, don't you
want to help

06:05.713 --> 06:07.497
good, everyday people?

06:07.541 --> 06:10.282
Magnum, you're begging.I'm not begging.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.415
I just want you to understand
both offers, that's all.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.764
I am well aware.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.331
Listen,

06:15.375 --> 06:19.335
speaking of offers,
I am kind of worried about Rick.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.337
Do you know that more than 80%

06:21.381 --> 06:23.339
of new pubs
and restaurants fail?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.862
La Mariana's
been around forever.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.995
It's just under new management.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.084
Yes, but if it fails,
Rick is without a job

06:29.127 --> 06:31.391
and with a huge loan to repay.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.305
I don't know,
Rick's always got this funny way

06:33.349 --> 06:34.698
of always making things
work out.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.839

Aloha.

06:50.322 --> 06:51.411
Thomas Magnum?

06:51.454 --> 06:54.457
Yeah. And you are...?

06:54.501 --> 06:55.763
My name is Jin.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.634
Sorry, uh, when I
couldn't get ahold of you,

06:57.678 --> 06:59.419
I came straight here.
It's very important.

06:59.462 --> 07:02.291
Are you wearing
a false mustache?

07:02.334 --> 07:05.425
Yeah.
Are you in hiding?

07:05.468 --> 07:08.906
Ish. There may or may not be
various people looking for me.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.518
Well, it's pretty
secluded here.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.171
You can probably
drop the disguise.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.352
I'm sorry, why are you
wearing a false mustache

07:20.396 --> 07:21.919
if you already have
a real mustache?

07:21.963 --> 07:23.965
Well, this is obviously
a fake mustache,

07:24.008 --> 07:25.183
and if people are
looking for me,

07:25.227 --> 07:26.446
they wouldn't be looking
for a guy

07:26.489 --> 07:27.708
with a real mustache.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.493
Uh, yeah.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.929
[chuckles]
Seems logical.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.931
So how can we help you?

07:33.975 --> 07:36.064
Okay, so, um,
I found a phone this morning

07:36.107 --> 07:37.935
and I don't know
who it belongs to.

07:37.979 --> 07:41.504
Oh. Well, I know that Magnum
doesn't look like much,

07:41.548 --> 07:42.940
but he tends
to deal with

07:42.984 --> 07:44.594
slightly more serious cases
than lost cell phones.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.509
Ah, yeah, but this, uh,
cell phone has a problem,

07:46.553 --> 07:47.554
and let me show you.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.427
That's not it.
That's not it.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.430
This is not it.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.823
Okay...

07:55.866 --> 07:58.434
So, you "found"
this phone?
Yeah.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.523
What about all the other
phones and wallets?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.003
They're mine.

08:02.046 --> 08:05.093
And what about the
pink Gucci necklace?

08:05.136 --> 08:07.269
Oh, there's a very
funny story behind this,

08:07.312 --> 08:09.576
I'm holding this
for my sister and...

08:10.751 --> 08:12.492
...she had her quinceañera.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.624
You're a thief.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.845
Easy. I prefer
"asset redistributor." Okay.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.281
Oh, found it.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.587
Listen, I couldn't
go to the cops

08:20.630 --> 08:23.633
because I tend to dance
on the line of morality.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.548
Line of morality?
You're a pickpocket.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.594
What makes you think
that we won't go to the cops?

08:27.637 --> 08:30.597
Duh, P.I.-client
confidentiality.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.207
That's not a thing.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.339
It is.

08:34.383 --> 08:37.342
No. Doctors, lawyers,
and clergy. Not P.I.s.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.475
A-Are you sure?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.085
Huh.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.957
Okay, I snagged
a bunch of phones,

08:44.001 --> 08:45.655
and before I wiped them,

08:45.699 --> 08:47.744
some crazy messages
occurred on this phone.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.355
Okay.

is going on here, man.

never got the warning?

the right thing for once.

we have two killer dogs who
love to chew on unwanted guests.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.599
Okay, let me see.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.124
Patty O'Sullivan.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.560
Yeah. That's my real name.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.517
I'm half-Irish.

10:05.561 --> 10:06.649
Huh.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.434
We're not taking this money.In fact,

10:09.478 --> 10:11.349
if you want us to help you
find out what happened

10:11.393 --> 10:14.309
to whoever sent that text,
you're going to have to agree

10:14.352 --> 10:16.441
to return all of the wallets...[sighs]

10:16.485 --> 10:17.965
...and all of the phones.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.010
All I have is my sister's
necklace now.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.099
And the necklace.

10:22.143 --> 10:25.450
Fine. Deal.

10:25.494 --> 10:28.323
Okay. So, the phone
that you stole...

10:28.366 --> 10:30.412
Borrowed....stole...

10:30.455 --> 10:33.589
belongs to a woman
named Sharon Lim.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.591
She's 20 minutes away
in Kalihi Valley.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.593
Great. You can drive.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.595
[titters]
Excuse me?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.423
You want me to drive?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.643
Yeah, I think we should,
you know, take turns.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.340
That's the kind of partner I am.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.037
All right. I see what
you're doing here,

10:47.081 --> 10:49.518
and this temporary generosity
will have absolutely no bearing

10:49.561 --> 10:51.346
on my decision
to partner up with you.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.826
All right?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.001
Plus, I have the keys.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.916
I don't need
your permission to drive.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.178
Oh, snap.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.570
Shotgun.
[chuckles]

10:58.614 --> 10:59.702
Shotgun?
Yeah.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.008
I'm tagging along.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.143
Listen, this is all my fault,

11:06.187 --> 11:09.756
and I need to make it right.

11:12.715 --> 11:15.762
Fine. But you're not
riding shotgun.

11:15.805 --> 11:16.937
HIGGINS:
Don't worry.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.503
Back seat's just as comfy.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.505
[grunting]

11:20.549 --> 11:22.769
I've sat in baby seats
way bigger than this.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.205
You sit in baby seats often?

11:24.248 --> 11:25.597
Oh, very funny.

11:25.641 --> 11:28.035
Don't worry, Jin, we won't
judge you if sitting

11:28.078 --> 11:30.994
in baby seats is something you
like to do in your spare time.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.692
I meant as a kid.[chuckles]

11:34.171 --> 11:36.173
Hey, you missed the turn.
That was Nohea Road.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.784
I know. I'm taking Hunakai.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.481
Why? Nohea's faster.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.831
Mmm, Nohea is shorter,
but it's winding roads.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.485
Hunakai's faster.

11:43.528 --> 11:44.965
It's not even close.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.271
I could get there faster
on Nohea Road on my bike, okay?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.621
Right. Is this your idea
of letting me drive?

11:49.665 --> 11:51.841
I just sit here behind the wheel
and you tell me what to do?

11:51.885 --> 11:53.800
It's not exactly being a
good partner, is it, Magnum?

11:53.843 --> 11:56.280
No, a good partner will
always tell you the truth,

11:56.324 --> 11:58.500
like when you're going
the wrong way.It's the right way.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.894
Yeah, if you want
to get there slower.It's objectively faster.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.331
[laughs]: Objectively?
Really? Come on.Really! Yes.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.072
Geez. Get a room.Jin,

12:05.115 --> 12:06.682
stay out of this, all right?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.206
I'm just saying, all the
bickering and all the tension...

12:09.250 --> 12:11.426
Wait a second,
are you guys partners

12:11.469 --> 12:14.081
or are you, like, partners?

12:14.124 --> 12:16.605
We're partners, all right?

12:16.648 --> 12:17.780
Bad idea if you ask me.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.434
I would never split
half my money.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.653
Jin, you're a thief. Uh, how
do you figure it's your money?

12:21.697 --> 12:22.654
Well, I'll tell you.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.004
No-- it was
a rhetorical question.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.570
I really don't want to know.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.312
It doesn't matter, 'cause
you're gonna hear it. All right?

12:28.356 --> 12:31.141
Everything that touches
my hand, it becomes mine.

12:31.185 --> 12:34.623
All right? I take the
risk, I reap the rewards.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.625
Okay? I'm the one
that prepares...
Oh, God.

Yes, we know.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.676
It's just that we're, uh, new
to the neighborhood, and we were

13:27.719 --> 13:29.721
wondering if you knew of
any good restaurants nearby.

13:31.854 --> 13:35.075
There's a diner
at the end of Pua Road.

This'll be quick.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.697
Did you say Punahou Road
or Pua Road?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.786
Pua.Pua. It was Pua, because
I thought it was Punahou,

14:34.830 --> 14:35.875
and me and my wife

14:35.918 --> 14:37.093
were arguing
about it,

I locked myself in the bedroom,

15:08.211 --> 15:09.691

the door.

Do you know who he is?

15:11.127 --> 15:14.914
No. Uh, he just said
we were gonna go for a ride.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.785
That's when
you showed up.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.875
to do with it.My phone?

Is your husband
associated

15:42.854 --> 15:44.856

Why not save us some time

I'm the boss.

I find that hard to believe.

Look, whatever is going on,
we know you're not

16:10.578 --> 16:12.058

16:12.101 --> 16:13.755
our friend Sharon here
for a ride.

16:13.798 --> 16:14.843
So?

16:14.886 --> 16:15.844
So you were most likely

16:15.887 --> 16:16.932
taking her to your boss,

16:16.976 --> 16:18.890
which just makes you
the meat sack

closed early today.

Does he do that often?No.

for our anniversary

16:29.945 --> 16:31.816
and for his annual
medical conference.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.992
It's not like him at all.

say anything else?

seeing patients as usual,

he suddenly cancelled

the rest of his appointments
and left.

That was just before those
warning texts were sent.

with the loan officer

Wow. Look at that.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.181
That's interesting.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.661
What do you got there?

19:00.704 --> 19:04.055
[stammers] The-the weather
in London is 54 and rainy.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.666
I wonder what Hawaii is.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.407
Magnum, focus. We have
a missing doctor to find.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.148
[laughs]: Oh!
Look at that.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.671
80 degrees and sunny.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.152
London, Hawaii, London...

19:13.195 --> 19:14.544
Magnum, you do realize
that this tactic

19:14.588 --> 19:15.937
is just another form
of begging.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.721
No, it's not,
I'm just laying out

19:17.765 --> 19:19.767
your potential
future living conditions.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.900
That's all.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.948
HIGGINS:
It appears someone beat us here.

19:26.991 --> 19:30.517
Either that or Dr. Lim's the
messiest doctor on the island.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.044
[taps on door]

19:45.009 --> 19:46.968
Jin, stop him!

19:47.011 --> 19:48.709
Stop him!

19:53.017 --> 19:53.975
[whimpers]:
Oh, my God.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.106
[groaning]

19:58.327 --> 20:00.111
Jin. What the hell?

20:00.155 --> 20:02.418
You insane?
Where'd you get a gun from?

20:02.462 --> 20:04.246
I found it in the glove
compartment. What?

20:04.290 --> 20:05.421
HIGGINS:
What?

20:05.465 --> 20:07.423
You have a gun.
Why shouldn't I?

20:07.467 --> 20:08.990
What were you doing
in the glove compartment?

20:09.033 --> 20:11.253
I just couldn't help myself.It was locked, Jin.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.516
Exactly. If it's unlocked,
I don't care.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.039
When I see something
I just can't have...

20:15.083 --> 20:16.824
Look, you can psychoanalyze
yourself later.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.521
Right now we have
bigger things to worry about.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.358
MAGNUM:
Here, put him down.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.099
[man groans, cries out]

20:31.142 --> 20:32.361
What the hell were you thinking?

20:32.405 --> 20:34.145
No, no, I was just
sitting in the car,

20:34.189 --> 20:35.799
like you told me,
texting my model girlfriend.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.584
Stop talking about
the model girlfriend, all right?

20:37.627 --> 20:39.063
You shot this man in the leg.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.282
You told me to stop him.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.023
Yeah, he meant
get in the way,

20:42.066 --> 20:44.504
not shoot him with a gun
that you stole.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.201
Put it that way,
it does sound like a dumb move.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.029
No, it's a dumb move
any way you cut it.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.292
Hold still.
[cries out]

20:50.336 --> 20:51.772
It looks like you're in luck.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.295
The bullet's just gone through
and through. Hold that.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.516
You'll need to get to hospital,
but you'll be fine.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.865
You trying to help me
or hurt me?

20:57.908 --> 20:58.866
Well, it depends on
what you were doing here.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.346
What's it to you?

21:00.389 --> 21:02.609
Doctor Lim disappeared today.
We're looking for him.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.045
Yeah, I know.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.394
What? How?

21:05.438 --> 21:07.744
I used to work here,
but I couldn't stay clean.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.355
All right?
[groans]

21:09.398 --> 21:11.748
Dr. Lim wound up firing me,
but he didn't change the locks.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.968
Sometimes I pop up in here
and grab some meds and scrips

21:14.011 --> 21:15.186
when no one's here.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.318
Oh, that's a new low.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.277
You steal stuff.
Man, get a job.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.497
Wait, I'm nothing like him.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.760
There's an art to what I do.

21:23.804 --> 21:26.589
Okay, look, tell us what
you know about Dr. Lim.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.678
I was waiting outside the office
for the doc and Letty

21:28.722 --> 21:31.638
to go to lunch when I saw him
get put into an SUV

21:31.681 --> 21:33.857
by two haoles.
It seemed weird,

21:33.901 --> 21:35.772
but when Letty locked up
the office early, I just...

21:35.816 --> 21:37.644
Broke in?
Yeah.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.863
Where, exactly, was he
put into that SUV?

21:39.907 --> 21:42.170
Right next to this building,
across from Hula's Liquor.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.612
I just need
one name from you.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.788
Oh...

21:53.573 --> 21:54.748
[sighs heavily]

21:54.791 --> 21:56.880
[phone line ringing]

21:56.924 --> 22:00.667
Hi, uh, I had an appointment
with Mr. Hale at 4:00.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.059
Would you please let him know
that I'm going to be

22:02.103 --> 22:03.670
running a little bit late?

22:03.713 --> 22:05.976
Thanks. Oh, uh,
and please let him know

22:06.020 --> 22:08.718
this is not indicative of
how I would run a business

22:08.762 --> 22:10.024
at all-- appreciate you.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.939
Oh, uh, one more thing.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.463
Could you not let him know how
desperate I was on the phone?

22:14.507 --> 22:16.030
[chuckles]
Okay.

22:16.073 --> 22:19.163
[click, dial tone]Hello?

22:19.207 --> 22:21.122
You ever hear of
"less is more"?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.341
[door opens]

22:22.384 --> 22:24.865
He didn't talk.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.171
No, but we ran his prints.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.869
Derrick Baxter, career thug.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.175
Former associate
of Vinnie Black.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.351
Wait, theVinnie Black?

22:32.394 --> 22:33.656
That name sounds familiar.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.180
Yeah, he was a mob boss
from Boston.

22:36.224 --> 22:37.965
Ran the city until
the late '90s.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.445
Oh, yeah, right.

22:39.488 --> 22:42.709
But didn't he get offed by
a rival gang or something?

22:42.752 --> 22:44.058
Car bomb.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.103
Caused a big power grab
in the crime world.

22:46.147 --> 22:48.715
All sorts of heavy hitters
tried to fill the void.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.195
So what's a gunman
with ties to the East Coast mob

22:51.239 --> 22:52.153
want with Dr. Lim?

22:52.196 --> 22:54.982
Not sure yet.[phone beeps]

22:55.025 --> 22:58.899
How bad of a first
impression you want to make?

22:58.942 --> 23:01.292
We gotta bolt.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.120
Thomas said he got
a lead earlier,

23:03.164 --> 23:04.078
so we'll keep you informed.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.776
That's refreshing.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.691
[door bells jangle]

23:11.128 --> 23:13.435
Hi, can I help you?

23:13.479 --> 23:16.438
Hello. Carl Wang,
LP Security.

23:16.482 --> 23:19.398
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.835
Congratulations?
For what?

23:21.878 --> 23:23.967
Your store was randomly selected
to receive

23:24.011 --> 23:26.013
a brand-new security system.

23:26.056 --> 23:28.102
Uh, we already got cameras.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.233
You mean those tin cans
out there

23:29.277 --> 23:30.713
facing the medical facility?

23:30.757 --> 23:32.802
What are those, PX-100s?

23:32.846 --> 23:35.152
My cell phone has
way better resolution.

23:35.196 --> 23:39.069
Well... I guess
if it's free, sure.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.984
Great. I'm gonna have
to see your hard drive.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.203
Okay. It's in the back.Cool.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.596
Hey, uh...

23:43.639 --> 23:46.425
your moustache.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.775
Oh... [laughs] I know.
It's a thing of beauty.

23:48.818 --> 23:51.995
Girls want to be around it,
guys wish they could grow it.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.910
Everybody wants a piece.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.478
Uh, no, it's falling off.

23:56.522 --> 24:01.222
What? Seriously?
Oh, my God, how awkward.

24:01.265 --> 24:03.267
Well, I'm gonna be completely
honest with you, then.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.618
I was born with
upper lip alopecia,

24:05.661 --> 24:07.968
and the last time
my moustache fell out,

24:08.011 --> 24:10.666
I got really insecure because
it didn't grow back as large.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.277
And that's why I wear
a fake moustache.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.541
Um, where we at with the...

24:15.584 --> 24:18.021
Uh, you were gonna show me
some credentials.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.982
[sighs]

24:24.245 --> 24:28.075
[clicking stapler]

24:31.208 --> 24:33.472
You know, hacking is
basically stealing.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.430
MAGNUM: We have to get
the footage somehow.HIGGINS: Really, Jin?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.259
I'd actually love to hear
your take on that.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.174
What I'm saying is when you hack
into a liquor store

24:40.217 --> 24:43.003
for security footage, there's
no difference between that

24:43.046 --> 24:45.222
and me stealing
a couple of wallets.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.746
Yeah, but she does it
to save lives,

24:46.789 --> 24:48.835
you do it to ruin lives by
taking their hard-earned money.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.489
You know, that's an interesting
way to spin that,

24:50.532 --> 24:52.229
but I-I--HIGGINS:
I'm in.

24:52.273 --> 24:56.016
Okay, this is the CCTV footage
from outside the liquor store.

24:56.059 --> 24:58.714
Fast forward to 11:30,
just when Dr. Lim

24:58.758 --> 25:00.237
sent the text message
to Sharon.

25:00.281 --> 25:03.066
MAGNUM:
Okay, there's Dr. Lim,

25:03.110 --> 25:05.068
and the thug who tried
to grab Sharon.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.070
Who's the guy in the backseat?

25:07.114 --> 25:09.116
Older than the others.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.247
Could be the boss.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.380
Yeah, he's definitely
our shot caller.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.821
[phone ringing]

25:18.865 --> 25:21.171
You guys okay?Safe and sound.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.651
Sharon's been a trooper.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.392
Trying my best
to hang in there.

25:26.786 --> 25:27.961
Hey...

25:28.004 --> 25:29.528
aren't you that chiropractor
who was giving

25:29.571 --> 25:31.181
free massages at the mall?

25:31.225 --> 25:33.836
[sighs]Really, Jin?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.142
Do you have something to say?

25:35.185 --> 25:37.274
Yeah. Magnum and Higgins

25:37.318 --> 25:39.668
wound up with your phone
because I stole it.

25:39.712 --> 25:42.541
I'm making up for it.
I'm sorry.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.804
I forgive you.

25:44.847 --> 25:48.416
Wow. That's a new kind
of feeling for me.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.591
Thank you.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.159
So, have you guys
found anything?

25:52.202 --> 25:54.161
Uh, we have a lead,
but we want you to see

25:54.204 --> 25:55.771
if you recognize anyone.

25:55.815 --> 25:58.382
I'm happy to help.

25:59.949 --> 26:03.170
That's Karl, one of
Michael's patients.

26:03.213 --> 26:04.214
Patient?

26:04.258 --> 26:05.259
SHARON:
Yeah, I help out

26:05.302 --> 26:06.695
as a receptionist
once in a while,

26:06.739 --> 26:08.349
so I've met him a few times.

26:08.392 --> 26:09.611
He has stage-three cancer.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.352
We think he may
have something to do

26:11.395 --> 26:12.614
with your husband's
disappearance.

26:12.658 --> 26:16.618
That doesn't make sense.
Karl was friendly.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.446
Why would my husband
be kidnapped

26:18.489 --> 26:19.926
by one of his own patients?

26:19.969 --> 26:22.711
We don't know. That's what
we're trying to figure out.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.278
In the meantime,
stay at Robin's Nest.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.280
You'll be safe there.

26:38.814 --> 26:39.902
Whoa, hold on, man.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.382
I know you're in a rush,

26:41.425 --> 26:43.166
but I just want to let you know
I'm proud of you.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.299
Proud of you for
making the leap.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.866
You got this.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.651
Oorah.
Oorah.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.566
See you in a minute.[chuckles]

26:54.221 --> 26:55.526
RICK:
So you can see
I've laid out here

26:55.570 --> 26:58.225
my one-year, five-year
and ten-year plan.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.661
Now, if you look
at the margins

26:59.705 --> 27:01.271
from the King Kamehameha
Club,

27:01.315 --> 27:04.448
you'll see these are very
conservative projections.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.320
Oh, you're a veteran.

27:06.363 --> 27:08.191
Yes. Yes, I am.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.846
Let's see...

27:10.890 --> 27:13.240
Oh...

27:13.283 --> 27:14.371
I know.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.069
You've recently been arrested?

27:16.112 --> 27:19.594
I was, and I'm not
making excuses for that.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.987
Look, you ask anybody
who knows me,

27:21.030 --> 27:23.206
and they will vouch
for my character.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.382
I'm sure they will,
but we're more of

27:25.426 --> 27:27.515
a numbers kind of bank,
as opposed to

27:27.558 --> 27:29.256
a your buddy's gonna
vouch for you kind.

27:29.299 --> 27:32.389
And your arrest makes you
a high-risk borrower.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.435
[computer beeps]

27:34.478 --> 27:35.436
Then there's your credit.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.307
Oh, I don't have
bad credit.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.875
You don't have any credit.

27:39.919 --> 27:43.270
Listen, I want this really bad.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.272
I'm willing to do what it takes
to make it happen.

27:45.315 --> 27:48.405
You tell me. You tell me,
what do I need to do?

27:54.107 --> 27:55.151
How'd it go?

27:57.763 --> 27:59.721
That bad, huh?

27:59.765 --> 28:04.117
Well... apparently,
serving in J-bad

28:04.160 --> 28:05.640
doesn't help build credit.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.252
But he, uh, he
thanked me for my service,

28:09.296 --> 28:11.690
so there's that.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.302
[sighs]

28:15.345 --> 28:19.698
You remember when you
took out Sajid Atwa?

28:19.741 --> 28:23.353
He was the sixth most
wanted terrorist at the time.

28:23.397 --> 28:26.617
You posted up in the
middle of a sandstorm

28:26.661 --> 28:28.010
based off of shoddy intel

28:28.054 --> 28:30.883
just for a chance
to snipe his ass.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.798
They said it was
a waste of time.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.364
They said you were crazy.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.062
Yeah, they were right.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.759
Took me 17 days to get him.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.849
But you saved hundreds
of lives, brah.

28:40.893 --> 28:45.071
All right...
I get it.

28:45.114 --> 28:49.118
I was making a difference,
but not building credit.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.859
Yeah, but that's
not my point.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.818
See, you're gonna go
to another bank,

28:52.861 --> 28:54.776
and another bank after that.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.909
And another one,
until you get that loan.

28:56.952 --> 29:01.261
'Cause when my boy
sets his mind to something,

29:01.304 --> 29:02.697
nothing gets in his way.

29:09.486 --> 29:10.879
This is a referral from Dr. Lim

29:10.923 --> 29:12.663
for Karl to see another doctor.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.796
Maybe he wanted
a second opinion.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.972
That's not a reason
to kidnap someone.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.235
I found something.What do you got?

29:19.279 --> 29:22.761
Dr. Lim's itinerary from a
medical convention in Las Vegas.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.807
It seems that he visited
the Mob Museum downtown.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.418
I thought we were supposed to be
looking into this Karl guy.Yeah.

29:28.462 --> 29:29.637
Stay with me.
When he got home,

29:29.680 --> 29:30.769
he started researching

29:30.812 --> 29:33.032
the deceased gangster
Vinnie Black.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.642
Rick and TC said
the gunman, Baxter,

29:34.685 --> 29:36.122
used to work for this guy.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.819
That doesn't sound
like a coincidence.No, it's not.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.734
And here's where it gets
really interesting.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.258
Okay, so Dr. Lim came home
and downloaded

29:42.302 --> 29:43.825
this age-manipulation app.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.871
It's pretty crude,
but take a look at this.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.786
Here's a photo of Karl,

29:47.829 --> 29:51.746
and here's what Vinnie Black
might look like today.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.878
Whoa.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.662
That's the same guy.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.185
I'm guessing that Vinnie Black
faked his demise

29:56.229 --> 29:57.796
in order to escape
his enemies,

29:57.839 --> 29:59.710
and it seems that he's now
living low in Hawaii.

29:59.754 --> 30:01.800
So maybe Dr. Lim
saw a picture of Vinnie

30:01.843 --> 30:04.541
at the Mob Museum in Vegas,
and started to connect the dots.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.239
And confirmed his hunch
when he got home.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.762
Oh, my God,
this is insane.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.634
A notorious, supposed-to-be-dead
gangster is still alive

30:10.678 --> 30:12.245
and hiding on
this island?

30:12.288 --> 30:14.029
And he has Dr. Lim.

30:20.557 --> 30:23.909
I got to say, it's really great
to be in your good graces again.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.867
First of all, you're not.
Second, who's this?

30:25.911 --> 30:27.173
HIGGINS:
This is Jin.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.870
He found Sharon's
phone and had it

30:28.914 --> 30:30.176
when the text
messages came in.

30:30.219 --> 30:31.177
That's why he
came to us.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.831
You look familiar.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.268
Yeah, I just have
one of those faces. You know...

30:35.311 --> 30:36.965
I'd actually argue you got
one of the more distinct faces

30:37.009 --> 30:37.966
I've ever seen.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.315
Thank you.

30:39.359 --> 30:40.795
And why didn't you just
bring the phone to us?

30:40.839 --> 30:44.451
Uh, d-- 'Cause we
know each other.How?

30:44.494 --> 30:46.018
My model girlfriend
had a stalker,Well, he gives me massages

30:46.061 --> 30:47.062
and I hired and Magnum,at the mall

30:47.106 --> 30:48.063
and I paid him
in a case--

30:48.107 --> 30:49.935
in massages.

30:49.978 --> 30:50.849
This is what I do.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.200
For a living.
At the mall.

30:54.243 --> 30:55.723
HIGGINS:
Gentlemen, can we

30:55.766 --> 30:56.942
please get back to the more
pressing matter at hand,

30:56.985 --> 30:58.900
namely, that Dr. Lim
has been abducted

30:58.944 --> 31:01.207
by a vicious gang lord,
who we believed to be dead.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.773
You get anything from Baxter?

31:02.817 --> 31:04.950
Nothing. Clearly, he's still
under Vinnie's thumb.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.908
We have to get him to talk.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.649
We find Vinnie Black,
we find Dr. Lim.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.651
Agreed. But he's way more scared
of Vinnie

31:10.694 --> 31:12.131
than any amount of jail time.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.046
And he didn't talk before,
so why would he start now?

31:14.089 --> 31:15.351
MAGNUM:
Uh, hold on.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.745
Baxter doesn't know that weknow

31:17.788 --> 31:19.616
the truth about Vinnie.So?

31:19.660 --> 31:22.881
So... I have an idea.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.971
What?

31:26.014 --> 31:29.191
Look alive, sunshine.
Your lawyer's here.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.194
Thank you, Detective.

31:33.630 --> 31:37.243
I demand all the microphones
turned off heretofore.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.593
And subsequently,
moving forward.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.769
Of course.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.336
[door closes]

31:43.379 --> 31:44.946
I'm Phillip Chang.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.687
And, uh, Vinnie
sent me.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.124
BAXTER:
You don't look
like a lawyer.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.865
That's precisely what makes me
a good one.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.911
I have two words for you:

31:52.954 --> 31:54.260
under the radar.

31:54.303 --> 31:55.652
That's three.

31:55.696 --> 31:59.439
Uh... Yeah-- Mr. Black
likes his employees

31:59.482 --> 32:00.962
to maintain a low profile,

32:01.006 --> 32:03.834
and your incident
is not welcome.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.836
Listen, Mr. Black

32:05.880 --> 32:07.099
is waiting for an update.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.753
And his patience
is running thin.

32:09.797 --> 32:12.017
You see where I am right now?Yeah.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.888
My hands are
literally tied.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.892
Not necessarily.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.379
I can't believe that worked.

32:26.422 --> 32:27.858
Even in my blazer,
he looks like a hobo.

32:27.902 --> 32:28.990
No offense.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.731
Offense taken.
That's very hurtful.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.907
Oh, come on.
Jin totally looks shady enough

32:32.951 --> 32:34.082
to hang with a guy like Vinnie.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.692
That's equally hurtful.

32:35.736 --> 32:38.695
All right, pinging
Vinnie's cell.

32:40.741 --> 32:44.092
Hang on. I had a money clip
in the inside pocket.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.573
Really?
KATSUMOTO: Yeah.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.749
What? I...
I have no idea.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.927
Jin actually threw it to me
as he walked in.

32:52.971 --> 32:53.928
[Jin exhales]

32:53.972 --> 32:56.148
Yeah.

32:56.191 --> 32:59.716
[computer beeps]KATSUMOTO: Got him.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.109

33:47.808 --> 33:49.984
But no sign of him
or Dr. Lim anywhere.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.040
KATSUMOTO: These messages were all recent.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.042
Black was definitely here.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.304
Yeah, his pasta's
half eaten.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.045
Yeah, the plate's still warm.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.958
He left in a hurry.

34:09.003 --> 34:11.136
Detective,
we found something.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.846
Straight out of Shawshank.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.022
Looks like it heads to the
south side of the property.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.980
All right, you two
follow the tunnel,

34:30.024 --> 34:32.244
I'll head around the property
and meet you where it ends. Go.

34:32.286 --> 34:34.114
Yes, sir.KATSUMOTO:
You guys, with me.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.241
There you are.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.286
Who are you?

35:14.329 --> 35:15.635
I'm just a patient.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.115
You see, I got this rash,

35:17.158 --> 35:18.725
and I've been trying
to track down Dr. Lim

35:18.768 --> 35:20.335
to take a look at it.

35:20.379 --> 35:23.121
VINNIE:
Keep talking and I'll put
a hole in you and Dr. Lim.

35:23.164 --> 35:24.296
Oh, I don't know.

35:24.339 --> 35:25.384
We have two guns

35:25.427 --> 35:26.950
and you only have one.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.169
It doesn't really seem like
a fair negotiation, does it?

35:28.213 --> 35:30.824
Oh, really?
Look behind you.

35:30.867 --> 35:34.828
[sighs]
Another hiding place?

35:34.871 --> 35:36.134
What is this,
Webster's house?

35:36.177 --> 35:37.831
Wait, is that the show
where the guy adopts

35:37.874 --> 35:39.093
the two kids
in the penthouse?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.399
No, that's Diff'rent Strokes.

35:40.442 --> 35:41.835
A lot of people
confuse the two.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.053
It's actually
a very different show.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.968
I'm sorry.
She's English.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.361
Enough.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.755
You know who I am.

35:48.798 --> 35:52.759
So believe me when I say
I'm only gonna count down once.

35:52.802 --> 35:55.762
Now... drop your weapons

35:55.805 --> 35:56.937
or he's dead.

35:56.980 --> 35:57.981

[indistinct radio transmission]

36:20.569 --> 36:22.571
[siren wailing]

36:29.056 --> 36:30.405
So, at exactly what
point did you realize

36:30.449 --> 36:31.624
that Vinnie was still
in the house?

36:31.667 --> 36:33.103
Probably the same
time as you.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.758
Wait... so you realized he was
still inside the house

36:35.802 --> 36:37.238
and left us there as bait?

36:37.282 --> 36:38.457
Considering you were gonna try
to take him down yourself,

36:38.500 --> 36:40.676
I don't think there's anything
wrong with that.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.417
Oh, we knew you'd circle back
because you're such a good cop.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.245
Stop kissing my ass.
You're still on thin ice.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.508
Still? I mean,
we just saved Dr. Lim

36:46.552 --> 36:48.684
and took down
a notorious gangster.

36:48.728 --> 36:49.903
KATSUMOTO: And the HPD
appreciates your help,

36:49.946 --> 36:50.991
but that doesn't mean
all is forgiven.

Right. And the reason

39:01.817 --> 39:04.429
you don't have any credit
is because you were

really great, but, uh,

39:18.704 --> 39:20.183
it could also
go very badly.

of very lucrative

but, uh, I suppose
since we're so close,

39:43.163 --> 39:44.686
I could let you invest.[chuckles]

40:01.268 --> 40:02.922
But this is--
It's so nice to meet you.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.619
Yeah, we caught up
in a little traffic,

40:04.663 --> 40:06.795
and when I say "traffic",
I mean, making out in my car.

40:06.839 --> 40:08.406
You know what I'm saying?
[chuckling]Yeah...

40:08.449 --> 40:09.407
Can I talk to you
for a second?Sure.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.365
I just want to say,

40:11.409 --> 40:13.236
you know, I know I don't have
the best track record,

40:13.280 --> 40:15.804
but it was really nice to do
something positive for once,

40:15.848 --> 40:18.633
and I want to thank you
for the chance, Magnum.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.679

My wallet.

[chuckling]: I'm sorry.
I just can't help myself.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.389
Yes, you can. You just don't
steal things from people.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.608
It's that simple.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.436
That's like telling
a bunny not to hop,

40:38.479 --> 40:39.437
