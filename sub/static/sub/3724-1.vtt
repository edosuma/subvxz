WEBVTT

00:05.436 --> 00:07.110
Okay, here we go.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.893
Opening night, "Everlasting", all right?

00:09.923 --> 00:11.715
Let's give 'em something that they want!

00:11.745 --> 00:14.050
Ponies! Princesses!

00:14.080 --> 00:15.268
Romance! Love.

00:15.298 --> 00:17.837
I don't know, it's all
a bunch of crap, anyways.

00:17.867 --> 00:18.922
Let's go, people.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.474
- The girls are about to arrive.
- Are you feeling nervous?

00:21.504 --> 00:23.042
I wouldn't say so, no.

00:23.072 --> 00:24.797
- Excited, then?
- Absolutely.

00:24.827 --> 00:25.596
- Good.
- I'm ready.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.726
Well, that's good...
because here they come.

00:51.406 --> 00:52.289
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.407
I'm Shamiqua.

00:53.437 --> 00:54.475
- Shamiqua?
- Yeah.

00:54.505 --> 00:56.768
- Okay. There we go. I think I got it.
- Cut! Cut! Cut!

00:56.798 --> 00:58.328
That's a cut! That's a cut!

00:58.358 --> 01:00.847
Everybody, back to one,
please! Let's hustle!

01:00.877 --> 01:01.826
Damn it!

01:01.861 --> 01:05.166
Shamiqua? That's your girl?

01:05.196 --> 01:07.470
That's the one who you
said had wife potential?

01:07.500 --> 01:08.912
- She's black.
- She's gorgeous.

01:08.942 --> 01:10.289
She went to Spelman.

01:10.319 --> 01:11.758
Okay, you know what?

01:11.788 --> 01:14.002
First girl out of the
carriage is always a wifey,

01:14.032 --> 01:15.969
and that is not a wifey.

01:15.999 --> 01:17.607
There's a black man in the White House.

01:17.637 --> 01:19.782
Oh, thank you so much. I know, okay?

01:19.812 --> 01:21.362
And he's barely black, all right?

01:21.647 --> 01:24.371
It is not my fault that
America's racist, people.

01:24.401 --> 01:26.523
Okay, Dan, let's go.
Get a new girl out here.

01:26.553 --> 01:27.431
Hustle, hustle.

01:27.461 --> 01:29.075
- Okay, got it.
- Ugh!

01:29.105 --> 01:30.647
- Where's Limo Three?
- Haven't seen it.

01:30.677 --> 01:32.116
- Where's Limo Three?
- I don't know.

01:32.146 --> 01:34.051
Nobody? "I don't know"? Limo Three.

01:34.081 --> 01:36.553
Um, you'd better be breaking
the damn sound barrier,

01:36.583 --> 01:38.450
because we need you here right now.

01:39.169 --> 01:40.396
- Uh, Limo Three?
- I can't even...

01:40.426 --> 01:41.057
Thank you.

01:41.087 --> 01:44.498
What part of "we are rolling"
did you not understand?

01:44.528 --> 01:45.793
- Your costing our production
- We're almost there.

01:45.823 --> 01:47.556
every second you're not here.

01:47.586 --> 01:48.560
You know, our flight was delayed.

01:48.590 --> 01:50.469
I can do a lot, Quinn, but
I can't control the weather.

01:50.499 --> 01:52.052
Just get your ass in here now.

01:52.082 --> 01:55.872
Hey, um, tiny girl, I
really have to pee, here...

01:55.902 --> 01:57.239
like, bad.

01:57.269 --> 01:59.661
Yeah, I can't really control the
weather, either, if you know what I mean.

01:59.691 --> 02:01.062
You know, I could actually go, as well.

02:01.092 --> 02:02.963
Okay, uh, well, ladies, we are just, um,

02:02.993 --> 02:03.864
a few minutes away,

02:03.894 --> 02:05.504
so do you want to know who the suitor is?

02:05.534 --> 02:06.705
- Oh...
- Oh, my gosh!

02:06.735 --> 02:08.270
- Yeah.
- Uh, yes?

02:08.300 --> 02:10.073
His name is Adam Cromwell.

02:10.103 --> 02:12.954
He is the British heir to
the Cromwell Hotel fortune.

02:12.984 --> 02:14.527
Oh, my gosh!

02:14.557 --> 02:16.357
- What?!
- Adam Cromwell?!

02:16.387 --> 02:17.704
Oh, my God!

02:19.829 --> 02:21.071
- That is absolutely...
- Adam Cromwell?

02:21.101 --> 02:22.580
- That's great.
- Oh, my God. He's so yummy.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.157
- You guys...
- Oh, my...

02:24.187 --> 02:25.121
- So?
- Oh...

02:25.151 --> 02:27.812
- He's got real...
- Oh, well...

02:30.017 --> 02:33.112
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Listen to me.

02:33.142 --> 02:33.935
Wake him up.

02:33.965 --> 02:36.582
He looks like he'd rather be
chewing cud than meeting hot girls.

02:36.612 --> 02:38.416
- Hold the roll. Hold the roll...
- So, I just, uh...

02:38.446 --> 02:42.005
Um, producers want you to
act a little bit more charming

02:42.035 --> 02:43.163
on the next take, so
we're gonna roll again.

02:43.193 --> 02:44.148
- More charming?
- Yeah.

02:44.178 --> 02:45.840
- Right. Okay.
- Okay?

02:46.289 --> 02:47.684
Oh, whatever.

02:47.714 --> 02:49.946
Just be a good meat puppet and do as I say.

02:49.976 --> 02:51.397
Uh, Limo Three just arrived.

02:51.427 --> 02:54.816
Oh, good. Okay, get in
here right now, Three.

02:55.021 --> 02:56.219
All right, ladies, phones, now.

02:56.249 --> 02:58.338
You don't want to see me
with no phone for eight weeks.

02:58.368 --> 02:59.806
Yeah, eight weeks if you're lucky.

02:59.836 --> 03:01.141
One night if you're not.

03:01.171 --> 03:03.118
- Okay, so eight weeks.
- Wow.

03:04.254 --> 03:05.055
Hey.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.433
- H-Hey, Rach, can we use the bathroom? 
- Ladies.

03:07.463 --> 03:09.949
Do not move from this
limo until I tell you.

03:09.979 --> 03:10.876
- Thanks.
- Uh...

03:10.906 --> 03:12.878
Rachel, what about the bathroom?

03:12.908 --> 03:14.514
Don't let them leave from this limo, okay?

03:14.544 --> 03:15.654
Copy that.

03:24.575 --> 03:26.234
You guys, get her when
she's coming in, okay?

03:26.264 --> 03:27.786
Cover her coming out.

03:31.516 --> 03:32.938
Oh, crap.

03:36.720 --> 03:37.526
Is that...?

03:37.556 --> 03:39.641
Yep, your boyfriend's ex.

03:41.977 --> 03:44.370
What? What, you guys really
need to be on Steadicam

03:44.400 --> 03:45.505
this whole time, shooting me?

03:46.752 --> 03:47.787
This is ridiculous.

03:47.817 --> 03:49.823
Welcome back to reality, Rachel.

03:49.853 --> 03:51.941
Rachel's the mystery freelancer?

03:51.971 --> 03:53.037
Surprise.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.106
Unbelievable.

03:55.141 --> 03:57.813
Yeah. Be afraid, okay?

03:57.843 --> 03:59.065
Crazy's back.

03:59.095 --> 04:00.783
Don't everybody rush to hug me at one time.

04:00.813 --> 04:01.813
I'm...

04:05.127 --> 04:06.884
Shit.

04:07.547 --> 04:11.408
== sync & corrections by Wolfen == 
== www.addic7ed.com ==

04:21.317 --> 04:22.855
Here we go.

04:22.885 --> 04:23.880
Ahh.

04:24.704 --> 04:26.637
It's about to get interesting.

04:27.757 --> 04:30.601
- Oh, yeah!
- Yay, welcome back, Rachel.

04:31.431 --> 04:32.574
Nice with the cameras. That was nice.

04:32.604 --> 04:34.478
Oh, my pleasure, my pleasure.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.982
My, my, my, look what the cat dragged home.

04:38.227 --> 04:40.161
I thought... I mean, weren't you...

04:40.198 --> 04:41.541
On probation?

04:41.571 --> 04:43.564
Yeah, and I'm doing community service.

04:43.594 --> 04:45.001
I'm still waiting on the, uh, trial

04:45.031 --> 04:46.429
for the civil charges, though.

04:46.459 --> 04:50.075
And, um, and you did the
pickups on the last of my girls?

04:50.674 --> 04:51.534
Nobody told me they were your...

04:51.564 --> 04:54.187
Y-Yeah, they're not
Shia's. They're yours, okay?

04:54.217 --> 04:55.120
Here you go.

04:55.150 --> 04:57.051
And, Shia, you have other girls.

04:57.081 --> 04:58.570
Yeah, but she gets the best ones?

04:58.600 --> 04:59.537
At least two stayers.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.339
Who you couldn't close.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.796
I had Rachel fly out
and convince the lawyer

05:03.826 --> 05:05.656
and the MILF to sign their contracts.

05:05.686 --> 05:07.249
So tonight, I want you floating,

05:07.279 --> 05:08.929
and maybe you can turn one of your dogs

05:08.959 --> 05:10.494
into a dark horse, okay?

05:10.524 --> 05:13.020
All right, I need the girls
from Limo Three now, please.

05:13.050 --> 05:14.902
Quinn, can you come down here, please?

05:14.932 --> 05:16.825
We have kind of a situation.

05:17.311 --> 05:18.945
Crap.

05:18.975 --> 05:21.381
All right, I'm on my way, and I'm pissed.

05:21.917 --> 05:25.143
Uh, we got a situation.

05:27.413 --> 05:29.119
I really have to pee.
Do you guys have to go?

05:29.149 --> 05:31.285
- I've had to since the airport.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:31.315 --> 05:32.995
Yeah. I know, they
haven't let us out at all.

05:33.025 --> 05:34.637
- Are you okay?
- How you doing?

05:34.667 --> 05:35.454
- I'm good.
- Good.

05:35.484 --> 05:36.315
Yeah, I mean, you know,

05:36.345 --> 05:37.510
it's a little bit
surreal being back, but...

05:37.540 --> 05:39.043
Too close! Yeah, but what?

05:39.073 --> 05:40.378
You're ready to get out there.

05:40.408 --> 05:41.538
- I think so. I...
- Okay.

05:41.568 --> 05:42.669
You know, Quinn, I just...

05:42.699 --> 05:44.237
my therapist says that
I can't really travel

05:44.267 --> 05:45.333
any more than I already have.

05:45.363 --> 05:46.634
I mean, I have to keep a schedule,

05:46.664 --> 05:48.104
- make my appointments.
- Yeah, okay, fine.

05:48.134 --> 05:49.224
- You know, I'm seri...
- Okay, travel. No travel.

05:49.254 --> 05:51.332
Whatever. Uh, where's Ricardo?!

05:51.362 --> 05:52.820
Hello?! Nobody?!

05:52.850 --> 05:53.866
All right, listen!

05:53.896 --> 05:56.823
I need 10 times more
pillar candles, people!

05:56.853 --> 05:58.047
10 times!

05:58.828 --> 05:59.533
Wow.

05:59.563 --> 06:01.506
They're all looking at me like, "huh?"

06:01.536 --> 06:03.153
You know, Quinn, I also
really want to thank you.

06:03.183 --> 06:05.054
Move! Don't thank me, all right?

06:05.084 --> 06:06.603
Just repay me. You owe me big-time

06:06.633 --> 06:07.840
after the mess you made.

06:07.870 --> 06:08.833
Okay, everybody, hold the work.

06:08.863 --> 06:10.514
We're gonna try this crane now, please.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.846
I can not believe that
I have to ask this again,

06:12.876 --> 06:14.306
but where is Limo Three?

06:14.336 --> 06:15.677
We are holding on that.

06:16.072 --> 06:18.522
The thing is Adam... We can't find him.

06:18.931 --> 06:19.785
What?

06:19.815 --> 06:21.269
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.667
- Chet's here.
- Oh, great.

06:23.697 --> 06:25.306
Just... everybody act
like everything's fine.

06:25.336 --> 06:29.240
Yep. Chet Wilton, creator
of "Everlasting," big kahuna.

06:29.325 --> 06:31.404
Don't worry, Lizzie.
Come here. Give me a kiss.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.282
Mmm.

06:33.312 --> 06:34.384
I hear we have a situation.

06:34.414 --> 06:36.179
I didn't know you were here.

06:36.209 --> 06:38.401
Oh, I'm hanging out with
my homeys in the grip truck.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.881
Where's my royalty?

06:40.065 --> 06:42.249
Um, maybe you'd like to answer that?

06:42.279 --> 06:44.001
Just watch. It's fine.

06:44.257 --> 06:45.623
Yeah? Okay.

06:45.653 --> 06:46.570
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.201
- Uh, we stopped rolling.
- Right.

06:49.231 --> 06:51.281
I took my eyes off him for a minute, and...

06:51.311 --> 06:53.038
uh, we lost him.

06:54.804 --> 06:55.625
Who are you?

06:55.655 --> 06:57.193
Dan... uh, first A.D.

06:57.223 --> 06:58.811
We've worked together for four years.

06:58.841 --> 07:00.591
All right. Who are you?

07:00.861 --> 07:02.643
- Uh, S-Sam, second A.D. 
- This is Sam.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.784
Sam. Sam, you're now the first A.D.

07:04.814 --> 07:06.113
You're now fired.

07:06.649 --> 07:07.344
Okay?

07:07.374 --> 07:09.116
- I need you to get your crap and get out.
- Okay.

07:09.146 --> 07:11.381
- Chet, I...
- No, no, no. It's not a conversation.

07:11.411 --> 07:13.275
I need you to get off of my set,

07:13.305 --> 07:14.760
or you're not gonna be able
to get a job in this town

07:14.790 --> 07:16.095
as anything but a crack whore...

07:16.125 --> 07:17.046
assistant crack whore.

07:17.076 --> 07:18.292
- An assistant crack whore.
- Uh, Chet, Chet.

07:18.328 --> 07:20.413
- Chet, uh, could you come here, please?
- Yeah.

07:20.443 --> 07:21.962
Um, you can't just walk in here

07:21.992 --> 07:23.719
and replace my experienced A.D.

07:23.749 --> 07:25.354
- with some kid.
- Hey, relax, Quinn.

07:25.384 --> 07:26.333
You got this.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.317
No, no, no, no, no.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.636
Unlike some people,

07:28.666 --> 07:30.810
I don't own a billion-dollar franchise.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.516
I have to work for a living, all right?

07:32.546 --> 07:33.963
I'm going to get fired.

07:33.993 --> 07:34.719
You're not gonna get fired.

07:34.749 --> 07:37.200
- I'm not gonna let that happen to you.
- I am serious.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.252
No Adam, no show.

07:39.282 --> 07:41.370
Even you can't bail me out of this.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.600
- Rachel!
- Yes?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.223
- Go find him.
- Who? Adam?

07:44.253 --> 07:45.775
I, um, I've never e...

07:45.805 --> 07:46.953
I don't even know... I've never met him.

07:46.990 --> 07:48.644
- You're gonna let this one handle it?
- Yes.

07:48.674 --> 07:50.624
She's the best, don't you think?

07:50.654 --> 07:51.731
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:51.761 --> 07:53.094
Welcome back, little weirdo.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.506
You're very lucky

07:54.536 --> 07:55.652
that your little stunt

07:55.682 --> 07:57.320
got me booyah ratings last season.

07:57.350 --> 08:00.657
Yeah, that was, uh, that was lucky, yeah.

08:00.687 --> 08:02.084
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

08:04.107 --> 08:05.337
You know what?

08:05.367 --> 08:07.727
You're not hot enough to be crazy,

08:07.757 --> 08:11.696
so I need you to keep
your brains together, okay?

08:11.981 --> 08:14.322
You, in your office, now.

08:14.659 --> 08:15.900
Okay.

08:16.335 --> 08:17.761
Uh, listen, stay on walkie,

08:17.791 --> 08:19.842
- and let me know when you find him.
- Okay.

08:19.872 --> 08:21.292
Also, he wouldn't sign his contract.

08:22.972 --> 08:24.304
What? Quinn!

08:24.901 --> 08:27.808
Quinn, you shot footage on
him without a signed contract?

08:27.838 --> 08:29.935
He said he wanted to show
it to his lawyers in London,

08:29.965 --> 08:31.082
or some nonsense, all right?

08:31.118 --> 08:32.399
What was I supposed to do?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.453
We have seven and a half
hours before sunrise,

08:34.484 --> 08:37.033
can only shoot in hard night,
and I need a frickin' show!

08:37.063 --> 08:38.467
That's great! So d... So I... So I...

08:38.498 --> 08:39.671
What, I have no leverage?

08:39.701 --> 08:43.056
Oh, just make something up.

08:43.385 --> 08:44.918
Do your job.

08:45.361 --> 08:47.588
You do not want to piss me off
on your first day back, okay?

08:47.618 --> 08:50.275
Just go get our show pony, now!

08:50.893 --> 08:51.925
Damn it.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.712
Adam. Hi.

09:01.527 --> 09:02.777
Hi. I'm Rachel.

09:02.807 --> 09:04.203
- Listen, I, um...
- No, look.

09:04.233 --> 09:05.536
I've got a friend coming to pick me up,

09:05.566 --> 09:07.754
- and I'm not changing my mind.
- Okay.

09:07.784 --> 09:09.222
Ugh.

09:09.252 --> 09:11.942
Oh, my ass is just on
the line with my boss.

09:11.972 --> 09:14.211
With Quinn? No kidding.

09:14.540 --> 09:15.533
That lady's a piece of work.

09:15.563 --> 09:18.076
Yeah. You have no idea.

09:18.156 --> 09:19.961
Ugh.

09:21.957 --> 09:23.963
Well, do you think I could
just spend 10 minutes up here

09:23.993 --> 09:26.943
while I figure out what
to do when I get fired?

09:27.897 --> 09:30.047
10 minutes... in silence, though.

09:33.853 --> 09:36.337
Open the other one. It's
hot as balls in here.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.160
Hey, uh, can I have a word?

09:38.190 --> 09:40.296
- Ugh, go, go, go. Quick. Come on.
- Y... I... Look.

09:40.326 --> 09:41.326
- Spit it out. Let's go.
- I think it's great that you got

09:41.356 --> 09:42.287
Rachel back, really.

09:42.317 --> 09:43.696
- Ugh.
- I guess I'm just confused.

09:43.726 --> 09:44.551
I mean, did I do something wrong?

09:44.581 --> 09:46.703
- You gave all my best girls to Rachel.
- Rachel gets the best sound bites,

09:46.733 --> 09:49.890
and she has killer instincts for drama.

09:50.086 --> 09:51.274
- Did you hear from her?
- No.

09:51.304 --> 09:53.278
Okay, it's just that after she bombed out,

09:53.327 --> 09:54.727
I cleaned up her mess.

09:54.757 --> 09:56.936
I know, but the thing is, Shia,

09:56.966 --> 10:00.100
people trust her, and they like her.

10:00.450 --> 10:02.253
That stuff can't really be taught.

10:02.355 --> 10:04.605
Chet to Quinn. I'm waiting.

10:04.989 --> 10:06.274
Crap!

10:06.309 --> 10:07.580
Okay.

10:07.610 --> 10:08.860
I'm coming!

10:10.026 --> 10:12.580
Who gave Chet a walkie?!

10:15.919 --> 10:18.252
- Just out of curiosity...
- Quiet.

10:21.357 --> 10:22.912
I'm sorry, what was so offensive

10:22.942 --> 10:25.810
to your refined sensibilities
that you needed to flee?

10:25.840 --> 10:27.328
Did you see that circus?

10:27.642 --> 10:30.381
How about the way they
introduced those horrible girls?

10:30.411 --> 10:31.904
Not to mention the fact
that Quinn wants to shoot me

10:31.934 --> 10:33.006
with my shirt off,

10:33.036 --> 10:35.241
riding a horse down the beach, shouting,

10:35.271 --> 10:37.388
"I'm gonna meet my wife tonight!"

10:38.042 --> 10:39.394
And?

10:39.855 --> 10:42.195
- You've seen the show, right?
- Barely.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.011
Quinn promised me that this season

10:43.041 --> 10:44.020
was gonna be different, though.

10:44.050 --> 10:46.584
Oh. Okay.

10:46.719 --> 10:47.924
I mean, you don't seem naive,

10:47.954 --> 10:50.326
but I guess, with that whole Napa thing...

10:50.356 --> 10:51.477
Napa?

10:51.507 --> 10:53.479
Napa, I was...

10:53.509 --> 10:55.598
I was trying to open a new hotel, and...

10:55.628 --> 10:57.377
my own, without my father.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.263
Royal hottie drops trou with three...

10:59.293 --> 11:01.275
or, I'm sorry, was it four hookers?

11:01.305 --> 11:02.147
And then tweets a selfie?

11:02.177 --> 11:03.262
Screw you. I don't know you.

11:03.292 --> 11:06.671
I know you... or at
least I know your agenda.

11:06.873 --> 11:08.773
You don't need a matchmaker.

11:09.676 --> 11:11.287
You need damage control.

11:11.661 --> 11:13.483
Nobody's gonna bet money on your hotel

11:13.513 --> 11:15.429
until you rehab your image.

11:15.459 --> 11:17.144
A couple of weeks on
the cover of Us Weekly...

11:17.174 --> 11:18.679
that's gonna do the trick.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.392
- Who's on channel three?
- Okay.

11:22.422 --> 11:23.778
- Hello?!
- Okay.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.158
Calm down.

11:25.420 --> 11:28.027
I hate it when Rachel goes off walkie.

11:28.057 --> 11:28.834
I know the job.

11:28.864 --> 11:30.863
You know, I'm trying to get
you to relax a little bit.

11:30.893 --> 11:32.648
Okay. You got this. You got this.

11:32.678 --> 11:33.845
You'll get it. You'll figure it out.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.425
- You're my little queen.
- I know.

11:35.455 --> 11:36.914
Oh, God.

11:36.944 --> 11:38.538
So cut the crap.

11:38.568 --> 11:40.260
What's it gonna take for
you to sign the contract,

11:40.290 --> 11:41.556
straight-up?

11:43.422 --> 11:44.859
Well, um...

11:45.344 --> 11:46.966
I'd have to think about it.

11:46.996 --> 11:48.095
Okay.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.563
It's just not gonna work.

11:49.593 --> 11:52.867
Uh, we have a backup guy.

11:53.469 --> 11:55.330
There's a backup guy?

11:56.004 --> 11:58.831
Yeah, some, uh, Doctors Without Borders guy

11:58.861 --> 12:00.415
who found a cure for malaria or something.

12:00.445 --> 12:01.343
Oh, wow.

12:01.373 --> 12:03.049
Malaria... that's...
that's one of my causes.

12:03.079 --> 12:04.750
I would... I would love to meet him.

12:04.780 --> 12:05.935
Awesome. Cool.

12:05.965 --> 12:08.426
Yeah, he'll, uh, be in
makeup in about 10 minutes.

12:08.456 --> 12:09.834
Cheers.

12:09.864 --> 12:11.169
We all have to pee!

12:11.199 --> 12:12.328
Yeah. Excuse me.

12:12.358 --> 12:13.710
Please, let us out.

12:13.740 --> 12:16.499
Hi. Dorothy, this is really important.

12:16.529 --> 12:17.651
We have to pee.

12:17.681 --> 12:19.416
I know. I'm so sorry. I...

12:19.446 --> 12:21.050
- Okay, well, you know what?
- Oh!

12:21.080 --> 12:22.969
We'll be really fast, I promise.

12:22.999 --> 12:24.549
Oh, my God.

12:26.233 --> 12:28.302
Ay-yi-yi!

12:28.719 --> 12:30.864
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

12:30.894 --> 12:32.656
God, I'm gonna piss my myself

12:32.686 --> 12:34.958
I needed this!

12:37.925 --> 12:39.302
Oh, my God!

12:39.332 --> 12:40.218
Whoa.

12:40.248 --> 12:42.683
Are rodeo girls, like, not allowed to wax,

12:42.713 --> 12:44.991
- or something?
- Come on, be nice.

12:45.021 --> 12:47.126
That's not a bush, that's a freakin' shrub!

12:47.623 --> 12:49.162
Okay, come on.

12:49.192 --> 12:50.797
I think I have a razor in the car.

12:50.827 --> 12:51.915
Do you want it?

12:51.945 --> 12:53.500
Come on, be nice.

12:53.530 --> 12:55.301
- Please, just get back in the car, please.
- I am being nice.

12:55.331 --> 12:57.415
I'm trying to help her out.

12:59.352 --> 13:00.440
- Here you go.
- Mike check!

13:00.470 --> 13:01.682
Thanks.

13:03.205 --> 13:04.010
Rachel.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.178
Hey. Hi.

13:05.308 --> 13:06.642
What the hell are you
thinking, coming back here?

13:06.672 --> 13:08.990
Sorry. Yeah, I'm... Jeremy,
I'm sorry that I, um...

13:09.020 --> 13:11.435
Oh, that you disappeared
without saying a word?

13:11.465 --> 13:12.235
Yeah. Um...

13:12.265 --> 13:13.056
Uh, Rachel.

13:13.086 --> 13:14.241
- Where the hell are you?
- You know, I got to...

13:14.271 --> 13:15.499
- I have to go, because...
- Yeah, I know.

13:15.529 --> 13:16.861
- Uh, same walkie channel.
- She's making... Okay.

13:16.891 --> 13:18.986
But, Rachel, seriously, what
the hell? I called, like, a lot.

13:19.016 --> 13:19.905
Yeah, I just... I didn't...

13:19.935 --> 13:21.405
I didn't have my phone. I-I didn't.

13:21.435 --> 13:22.729
You shower with your phone in a Ziploc bag.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.412
Okay, Jeremy.

13:25.128 --> 13:27.409
We weren't supposed to
get stuck in Mexico, okay?

13:27.439 --> 13:29.897
And I was, um, profoundly exhausted,

13:29.927 --> 13:31.688
and I was sunburned, and I...

13:31.718 --> 13:33.973
- bathing in white wine by the end of it.
- Hold it. Wait. Did you...

13:34.003 --> 13:35.772
Did you just use being sunburned as...

13:35.802 --> 13:38.077
as an excuse for not...

13:38.107 --> 13:39.896
That's unbelievable.

13:39.926 --> 13:41.201
Yeah.

13:41.895 --> 13:44.033
Okay, obviously, we have to work together,

13:44.063 --> 13:47.286
so just...stay away
from me when we're not...

13:47.316 --> 13:48.211
Yeah. Okay.

13:48.241 --> 13:52.236
I mean, you know, I'm not traveling, so...

13:52.887 --> 13:53.776
Good.

13:53.806 --> 13:55.459
Yep. Okay.

13:59.645 --> 14:02.084
Oh, I saw that you and Lizzie
got back together, right?

14:02.114 --> 14:03.695
And, what, did you, like, get her a job

14:03.725 --> 14:05.262
on the show, or...?

14:05.683 --> 14:09.075
Yeah. I mean, she's been trying
to leave the salon forever, so...

14:09.105 --> 14:12.439
That's so cute, having
your girlfriend at work!

14:12.469 --> 14:13.411
- The trailer...
- It's fiancée.

14:13.441 --> 14:15.042
Wait, what?

14:15.504 --> 14:17.078
She's my fiancée.

14:18.682 --> 14:20.898
- I called, Rach.
- Yeah.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.936
Rachel! Pool! Now!

14:24.385 --> 14:26.118
Flying in.

14:32.536 --> 14:34.053
There is no backup malaria doctor,

14:34.083 --> 14:35.307
- is there?
- Try me.

14:35.337 --> 14:36.660
Rachel, what the hell is happening?

14:36.690 --> 14:38.095
- Every minute we're not shooting...
- Can you calm down.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.413
Please, okay?

14:39.443 --> 14:41.482
I told him about the backup guy.

14:41.512 --> 14:44.346
What backup guy? We don't have a back...

14:46.300 --> 14:47.299
Nice.

14:47.734 --> 14:49.501
Do you think he bought it?

14:49.531 --> 14:51.909
I think we walk away
right now, we find out.

14:51.939 --> 14:52.905
Okay.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.862
Uh, bring in the backup guy!

14:54.892 --> 14:55.892
Shit.

14:57.428 --> 14:59.562
Let's go, people! Oh, look at the candles.

14:59.592 --> 15:01.030
I'll do it.

15:02.934 --> 15:05.406
But one of the dates has to
be at my hotel site in Napa.

15:05.836 --> 15:07.274
I want guaranteed shots of the signs

15:07.304 --> 15:08.620
and a verbal mention of the hotel name.

15:08.872 --> 15:09.938
Aha. New demands.

15:09.968 --> 15:12.796
Of course. Done, all right?

15:12.826 --> 15:14.876
Now just get back to work, you limey prick.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.201
She's charming.

15:17.231 --> 15:19.325
No, they're not ready!

15:19.984 --> 15:21.956
Okay. Here we go...

15:21.986 --> 15:23.040
Again.

15:23.070 --> 15:24.041
This one's gonna be good.

15:24.071 --> 15:25.209
Okay, cameras rolling!

15:25.239 --> 15:27.411
Sound speed! Camera speed!

15:27.441 --> 15:29.529
Okay, and... action.

15:29.559 --> 15:30.916
All right. Here we go.

15:30.946 --> 15:32.427
Please, just be better.

15:32.457 --> 15:33.817
This is good. This is good.

15:34.047 --> 15:35.313
- Oh, look.
- Oh, yes.

15:35.343 --> 15:37.426
That's what I'm talking about.

15:37.456 --> 15:38.852
- Okay.
- Yes, sashay, shantay.

15:38.882 --> 15:40.324
That's right.

15:40.354 --> 15:42.093
- Hi.
- I'm Britney.

15:42.123 --> 15:44.170
- That is an entrance.
- Oh!

15:44.200 --> 15:45.380
Oh!

15:45.410 --> 15:48.382
- Oh, wow!
- Damn! Damn!

15:48.412 --> 15:50.017
Did you tell her to do that?

15:50.047 --> 15:51.813
I just told her that he was very sexual

15:51.843 --> 15:53.087
and she should go for it.

15:53.117 --> 15:55.189
Nice. People are going to hate her.

15:55.219 --> 15:55.956
Mm-hmm.

15:55.986 --> 15:57.431
But I like her.

15:57.630 --> 15:59.543
Oh, Mary.

15:59.573 --> 16:02.324
Sad, dried-up single-mother Mary.

16:02.693 --> 16:03.878
Okay, come on. What have we got?

16:03.908 --> 16:05.225
This is Mr. Bobo.

16:05.261 --> 16:06.400
- Mr. Bobo.
- Yes.

16:06.430 --> 16:07.972
Oh, I hope she takes that stupid bear,

16:08.002 --> 16:09.386
and she's like, "Oh, my baby daddy

16:09.416 --> 16:11.271
done did me wrong with Little Booboo."

16:11.301 --> 16:13.236
- She's not even black.
- That's racist.

16:13.266 --> 16:15.004
You know something? That's
gonna be super tough.

16:15.034 --> 16:16.394
Because she's very smart and guarded,

16:16.424 --> 16:18.495
and her last relationship, it was, uh,

16:18.525 --> 16:19.630
it was rough, right, Doc?

16:19.660 --> 16:23.734
Yeah, she does show some
signs of, uh, PTSD, it's true.

16:23.764 --> 16:26.053
- And she also...
- And that is why we cast her...

16:26.083 --> 16:27.788
for the crazy, all right?

16:27.818 --> 16:30.591
Besides, she knew what she was in for.

16:30.621 --> 16:31.592
They all do.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.160
The crazier the better.

16:33.190 --> 16:35.524
Okay, Adam. Look at him.

16:35.554 --> 16:36.930
He's about as charming as a corpse.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.132
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh!

16:38.162 --> 16:39.890
- Hello.
- Hello, handsome.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.197
That's my kind of woman.

16:45.346 --> 16:47.636
Hi. I'm Faith.

16:48.022 --> 16:48.904
Okay.

16:48.934 --> 16:51.579
We just gave him a
linebacker in a jumpsuit,

16:51.609 --> 16:53.514
and he just says, "Okay."

16:53.544 --> 16:55.277
Uh, that's our, uh, horse-faced tearjerker.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.177
And a virgin, right?

16:56.207 --> 16:58.013
Yeah, but she is so shy about that stuff,

16:58.043 --> 16:59.713
and we have so many other
angles on her, you know?

16:59.743 --> 17:00.982
Jesus freak, boob job...

17:01.012 --> 17:02.617
Those are... Those are my boobs.

17:03.053 --> 17:04.551
Well, I convinced her to get them.

17:04.582 --> 17:05.742
I even got Grandma's church

17:05.771 --> 17:07.344
to take up a collection to pay for them.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.643
Grandma! Nice.

17:08.673 --> 17:09.747
But whatever, all right?

17:09.777 --> 17:11.565
A train wreck like that's
not staying past tonight.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.767
I need a sound bite before she goes.

17:13.797 --> 17:15.703
Adam, I want you to be my first, okay?

17:15.733 --> 17:16.964
Please, baby Jesus.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.517
And then he dumps her, and it's perfect.

17:18.547 --> 17:21.569
Okay, come on. Brazilian swimsuit model.

17:21.672 --> 17:23.839
Yes, this has got to wake him up.

17:23.924 --> 17:25.279
Hey.

17:25.309 --> 17:27.615
Wow, gorgeous. Like these moves?

17:27.645 --> 17:28.516
I do, yeah.

17:28.546 --> 17:30.586
- Finally! Thank you! A smile.
- Nice to meet you.

17:30.616 --> 17:34.315
- Grace.
- That's all I wanted, was a smile, Adam.

17:34.363 --> 17:37.569
Hello, ladies, and
welcome to "Everlasting"!

17:39.423 --> 17:41.456
Now, I can see that you all have received

17:41.486 --> 17:42.713
the, uh, diamond bracelets,

17:42.743 --> 17:44.309
which was our way of inviting you

17:44.339 --> 17:47.411
on a wonderful fairytale journey
with our lovely lad, Adam.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.770
But, unfortunately,

17:49.800 --> 17:51.538
- at the end of the night, uh, ladies...
- Okay. Great. All right.

17:51.568 --> 17:53.440
He's going to have to
reclaim those bracelets...

17:53.470 --> 17:56.753
but only for those girls that
he has decided to send home.

17:56.783 --> 18:01.515
Now, without further ado,
your suitor... Adam Cromwell!

18:04.060 --> 18:06.017
Okay, come on, let's go, people.

18:06.047 --> 18:08.188
Protect the wifeys, Anna and Grace,

18:08.218 --> 18:10.157
and starve our villain, Britney,

18:10.187 --> 18:12.259
until she is mean like a pit bull.

18:12.289 --> 18:14.859
I want to pickle the rest of them, okay?

18:15.058 --> 18:19.483
You get cash bonuses for nudity,
911 calls, catfights, all right?

18:19.513 --> 18:21.045
Have a good show, everybody.

18:21.664 --> 18:24.316
So, I've never actually
met, uh, a British person.

18:24.401 --> 18:25.606
- Thank you.
- Oh, there you go...

18:25.636 --> 18:27.218
- some champagne.
- Cheers.

18:27.304 --> 18:30.405
- To love, to future, to "Everlasting."
- Cheers.

18:30.435 --> 18:32.337
Thank you.

18:33.126 --> 18:34.415
Hi. Hi.

18:34.445 --> 18:35.732
Such a nice shirt.

18:35.762 --> 18:36.967
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

18:36.997 --> 18:38.758
Uh, your dress looks lovely.

18:38.788 --> 18:40.377
Thank you.

18:40.564 --> 18:41.822
You having a good time?

18:41.852 --> 18:42.701
A blast. Cheers.

18:42.731 --> 18:45.175
I have nothing, people, okay?

18:45.205 --> 18:46.159
Listen to me.

18:46.189 --> 18:48.028
Get me some one-on-one interviews.

18:48.058 --> 18:49.997
Get me some good TV!

18:50.027 --> 18:52.577
I see Faith. I'll prep her.

18:53.013 --> 18:54.324
Hi, Faith.

18:55.048 --> 18:56.415
- Hi.
- Shia, from the phone.

18:56.445 --> 18:57.421
What is Shia doing?

18:57.451 --> 18:59.167
- No, Shia.
- Oh!

18:59.286 --> 19:01.213
Oh, gosh!

19:01.525 --> 19:02.693
- Hi!
- Hi.

19:02.723 --> 19:04.111
- How are you?
- Ah!

19:04.141 --> 19:05.343
You're a waiter.

19:05.373 --> 19:07.581
Oh, no, no. It's like a disguise.

19:07.611 --> 19:09.161
A... They picked me to
manage you guys tonight,

19:09.191 --> 19:10.951
but since I'm on camera, I got to blend in.

19:10.981 --> 19:11.970
Okay. That's so clever.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.737
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh. Ugh.

19:13.767 --> 19:16.018
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Oh, okay.

19:16.048 --> 19:18.106
- Oh, my Gosh.
- What is she doing?

19:18.136 --> 19:20.271
Anyway, I wanted to say that,

19:20.357 --> 19:22.579
for the one-on-one tonight,
you... you really need to

19:22.609 --> 19:24.224
- make a good impression, and...
- Right.

19:24.254 --> 19:25.062
- Right.
- you don't have much time,

19:25.092 --> 19:27.768
- so you got to get right to the point.
- Okay. Which point?

19:27.998 --> 19:30.721
About yourself, about everything.

19:30.751 --> 19:32.606
No, Shia, I got it. Stand down.

19:32.636 --> 19:35.307
Oh, uh, I was just gonna sort of chat,

19:35.337 --> 19:36.777
like, uh, howdy-doody kind of...

19:36.807 --> 19:38.112
Okay, well, what we need you to do

19:38.142 --> 19:39.704
is talk about being a virgin.

19:39.734 --> 19:41.237
Oh!

19:44.816 --> 19:45.921
What?

19:46.056 --> 19:47.426
I mean, we think it's really great,

19:47.456 --> 19:48.473
- a-and w-we know he's going to love it. 
- Oh, oh, there, there, there.

19:48.503 --> 19:50.508
Tell them to go in. Madison, move!

19:50.538 --> 19:51.849
Push in, push in, push
in, push in, push in.

19:51.879 --> 19:54.774
It's super hot, and guys are into that.

19:55.316 --> 19:56.717
Who told you that?

19:56.747 --> 20:00.470
Uh, it was just... Rachel.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.794
Okay, we got the tears, we got the tears.

20:03.824 --> 20:05.699
- Yes!
- Oh, God.

20:05.936 --> 20:07.582
Stupid bitch.

20:07.612 --> 20:08.677
Faith?

20:08.779 --> 20:10.212
Faith, sweetie? Faith?

20:10.242 --> 20:11.468
Get camera "A" over there.

20:11.498 --> 20:12.519
"A" Cam, get in on Britney.

20:12.549 --> 20:14.633
Find Britney. There you go.

20:14.835 --> 20:16.929
Aw. Why is she crying?

20:17.602 --> 20:19.393
Maybe he spotted her super-shrub

20:19.423 --> 20:21.223
through that ugly-ass jumpsuit.

20:21.835 --> 20:24.865
Yes, that is a good bitch!

20:24.895 --> 20:25.816
Finally.

20:25.846 --> 20:28.344
And thank you.

20:28.374 --> 20:29.622
Thank you, Britney.

20:29.652 --> 20:30.621
Was this your plan,

20:30.651 --> 20:32.373
to have me come here and tell people...

20:32.403 --> 20:33.602
No, Faith.

20:34.675 --> 20:35.809
Adam. Please.

20:35.846 --> 20:39.077
Uh, oh. Uh, Faith. Hi.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.802
- Uh, hi.
- You okay?

20:40.981 --> 20:44.481
Yeah, uh, I just have
something...in my eye.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.840
These lashes are...

20:45.870 --> 20:48.220
Can I steal you for a second?

20:48.439 --> 20:49.439
Yes.

20:49.568 --> 20:52.657
Okay, just through here.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.876
- Okay.
- We'll just take a seat here.

20:56.814 --> 20:59.164
All right. Uh, I'm so sorry.

21:00.684 --> 21:02.818
This is not how I...

21:03.153 --> 21:05.092
how I planned to do this.

21:05.122 --> 21:05.918
- You're a virgin.
- Just that, uh...

21:05.948 --> 21:07.344
Give me that. Give me that.

21:07.624 --> 21:09.635
These other girls, um...

21:10.360 --> 21:12.549
I think I'm a little out of my league.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.051
Are you kidding me?

21:14.081 --> 21:15.920
I've been talking about gluten and CrossFit

21:15.950 --> 21:17.600
for the last two hours.

21:18.024 --> 21:19.852
You're the most attractive person here.

21:23.423 --> 21:24.372
Me?

21:24.402 --> 21:25.507
Yeah.

21:25.626 --> 21:27.042
Aww.

21:27.277 --> 21:29.466
Look at Adam, being so nice.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.896
What, you think Britney
would last in the rodeo?

21:32.065 --> 21:34.037
No, the clowns would kill her.

21:35.285 --> 21:37.223
Okay, you know what, this just turned into

21:37.253 --> 21:38.359
two guys in a locker room.

21:38.389 --> 21:39.543
Get me someone else now.

21:39.573 --> 21:40.889
They wouldn't really kill her.

21:40.919 --> 21:43.113
They'd probably strangle
her and leave her in a ditch.

21:43.143 --> 21:45.277
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

21:45.962 --> 21:47.447
Mary. Hi.

21:47.477 --> 21:49.197
- How's it going?
- It's good.

21:49.227 --> 21:49.924
Yeah? You look great.

21:49.954 --> 21:51.180
- You look great.
- Thank you.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.360
- Uh, here.
- Oh, no, thank you.

21:53.537 --> 21:54.281
- You sure?
- Yeah.

21:54.311 --> 21:56.690
All right, well, don't mind if I do.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.078
Mmm.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.996
How's it going with Adam?

22:01.026 --> 22:02.150
- Uh, Adam.
- Yeah.

22:02.180 --> 22:04.935
Well, I've seen him across the patio twice,

22:04.965 --> 22:06.499
and he looks young enough 
to be my step-son,

22:06.529 --> 22:08.416
so, needless to say, I'm madly in love.

22:08.446 --> 22:10.224
Nobody will tell me...

22:10.254 --> 22:12.037
- Huh?
- How old is he?

22:12.167 --> 22:13.222
He's 29.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.191
- Yeah.
- Oh.

22:15.809 --> 22:16.742
Okay.

22:16.827 --> 22:18.994
So, um, this...

22:19.517 --> 22:20.417
So this is a setup,

22:20.447 --> 22:22.519
and I'm I'm the old...

22:22.949 --> 22:23.854
old, desperate one?

22:23.884 --> 22:25.250
Are you kidding me? No way.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.666
He... he... he thinks you're a total MILF.

22:27.854 --> 22:28.773
- A MILF?
- Yeah.

22:28.803 --> 22:29.532
Oh, that's nice.

22:29.562 --> 22:30.516
No, you know what?

22:30.546 --> 22:33.383
Listen. He's completely open to you.

22:33.413 --> 22:35.291
All right, you've got to walkie
Rachel. Give her the stats, right now.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.424
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Okay, got it. Rachel?

22:37.454 --> 22:38.824
No, Doctor, you... on
the side, you got to...

22:38.854 --> 22:40.963
No, push the button. Push it!

22:40.993 --> 22:43.186
I... Okay, got it. Uh, uh, Rachel?

22:43.216 --> 22:45.354
Uh, Quinn says to tell you that,

22:45.384 --> 22:47.798
um, her husband was physically abusive...

22:47.828 --> 22:49.494
hit the kid, too, broke her arm,

22:49.524 --> 22:51.807
and that you should, you know,

22:51.957 --> 22:53.055
use it.

22:53.482 --> 22:55.178
Rachel. Um...

22:55.519 --> 22:56.785
Come on, Rachel.

22:56.820 --> 22:58.703
Take her down, okay?

22:58.733 --> 23:01.056
You airballed my virgin. You owe me this.

23:02.359 --> 23:04.765
Tick, tock, tick, tock, let's go.

23:04.795 --> 23:06.117
- Are you okay? 
- Y-Yeah.

23:06.147 --> 23:09.637
Uh... um... and Adam,

23:09.667 --> 23:10.846
you know, he would...

23:10.876 --> 23:13.469
he would never, ever hurt you.

23:14.072 --> 23:15.888
He's a really, really good guy.

23:15.918 --> 23:17.339
I know him.

23:17.870 --> 23:19.043
I promise.

23:22.329 --> 23:23.495
Um...

23:23.878 --> 23:25.574
Why should I believe you?

23:27.117 --> 23:30.908
Because I looked into Lily Belle's eyes,

23:30.938 --> 23:33.939
and I swore I'd protect you.

23:33.974 --> 23:35.123
I mean,

23:35.725 --> 23:37.210
and I would have to be a sociopath

23:37.240 --> 23:39.986
to lie to a 4-year-old, so...

23:40.016 --> 23:41.624
- True.
- Yeah.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.221
Give me the damn bear.

23:46.203 --> 23:49.243
Uh, can we, uh, can we
fly in Mary's bear, please?

23:49.273 --> 23:50.310
Thank you.

23:50.340 --> 23:51.428
Nicely done, Rachel.

23:51.458 --> 23:52.958
Nicely done.

23:53.093 --> 23:55.090
- Oh.
- Like magic.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.595
You've got it. You look beautiful.

24:00.393 --> 24:01.750
Cameras up, people.

24:01.869 --> 24:03.123
There we go. There we go.

24:03.153 --> 24:04.653
Are you behind me?

24:04.738 --> 24:05.324
- Thank you.
- Hi.

24:05.354 --> 24:07.528
Hi.

24:07.558 --> 24:08.590
So, um...

24:09.143 --> 24:10.282
Nice.

24:10.761 --> 24:11.582
First night back,

24:11.612 --> 24:13.295
and you throw a single mom to the wolves.

24:14.164 --> 24:14.861
Classy.

24:14.891 --> 24:15.747
You know what?

24:15.777 --> 24:17.032
Seriously,

24:17.356 --> 24:19.333
screw you, okay?

24:19.363 --> 24:20.674
There's... there's reasons

24:20.704 --> 24:21.992
that I had to get through tonight,

24:22.022 --> 24:23.427
reasons I had to come back.

24:23.457 --> 24:24.883
There always are with you.

24:24.913 --> 24:25.816
I just...

24:25.846 --> 24:27.381
- I just wanted you to know that...
- Heads up.

24:27.411 --> 24:30.262
my daughter, she is...

24:30.529 --> 24:32.746
the most important, most precious thing

24:32.776 --> 24:34.316
- in my life, you know?
- Yeah.

24:34.867 --> 24:37.703
And, um, well, this is her
most precious possession.

24:37.934 --> 24:38.754
Oh.

24:39.356 --> 24:40.588
She wanted you to have it.

24:42.184 --> 24:42.841
Oh.

24:42.871 --> 24:45.265
She wanted you to know how excited she was,

24:45.295 --> 24:46.783
or is, to have a new daddy.

24:47.648 --> 24:49.303
Oh! Baby daddy.

24:49.333 --> 24:50.548
- I told you!
- You called it.

24:50.578 --> 24:51.587
- I told you!
- You called it.

24:51.617 --> 24:52.885
Thank you.

24:52.915 --> 24:54.708
That's... That's really sweet. That is.

24:54.738 --> 24:55.726
Yeah. Look at that.

24:55.756 --> 24:58.629
Finally. That is what I'm talking about.

24:58.659 --> 25:00.457
Okay. Here we go!

25:00.818 --> 25:01.515
Hey.

25:01.545 --> 25:03.150
Hey, you remember when you used to be

25:03.180 --> 25:04.424
a women's studies major?

25:04.732 --> 25:06.019
I am, okay?

25:06.049 --> 25:08.839
Fair enough. But this gets to you.

25:08.869 --> 25:10.856
It makes you sick, Rach.

25:10.886 --> 25:13.260
The Mary scene has gone as dry as her old,

25:13.290 --> 25:14.745
shriveled pussy, all right?

25:14.775 --> 25:16.191
Get me some chemistry.

25:16.276 --> 25:18.465
God, she even offends me.

25:18.495 --> 25:19.567
What?

25:19.597 --> 25:21.759
It's like you guys have
never heard that word before.

25:21.934 --> 25:23.452
You did great. Thanks.

25:23.482 --> 25:25.124
I'll take that.

25:25.619 --> 25:26.673
- Heads up.
- Hi.

25:26.703 --> 25:27.731
Hi. How's it going? Hey.

25:27.767 --> 25:29.710
All right, Grace, come on.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.056
Here we go. This'll be good.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.141
How's your night going?

25:33.171 --> 25:35.227
Whew! It's, um...

25:35.412 --> 25:36.283
it's fun.

25:36.313 --> 25:37.796
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25:38.148 --> 25:39.720
Someone told me that you like to ride.

25:39.750 --> 25:40.866
We have to do that while we're here.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.439
Horses...

25:42.469 --> 25:43.347
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, horses.

25:43.377 --> 25:44.987
Okay, good. I ride horses.

25:45.017 --> 25:46.524
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:46.890 --> 25:47.978
Ah. Yeah.

25:48.008 --> 25:50.125
There's nothing like the feeling

25:50.334 --> 25:52.794
of a powerful animal between your legs.

25:52.824 --> 25:54.028
Wow.

25:54.058 --> 25:56.548
Wow, yeah.

25:56.578 --> 25:58.222
I... I really said that.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.135
- Oh, that's amazing.
- Um...

26:00.165 --> 26:02.035
That was not a line, I swear.

26:02.065 --> 26:04.262
I-I don't care, as long as it's true.

26:04.549 --> 26:05.690
It's true.

26:06.026 --> 26:08.159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:09.451 --> 26:10.599
Come here.

26:11.548 --> 26:13.166
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

26:15.436 --> 26:17.007
Wow. All right.

26:17.037 --> 26:18.876
That's all right. We
asked for it. Here we go.

26:19.069 --> 26:20.410
- She's that kind of girl, huh?
- That's what she's bringing.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.423
She's bringing it.

26:22.542 --> 26:23.645
- Uh-oh. 
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:23.675 --> 26:25.252
He has his hand on her boob.

26:25.282 --> 26:26.405
No. I know, I know. I got it, okay?

26:26.435 --> 26:28.835
It's too much, Rachel,
all right? It's Episode 1.

26:28.865 --> 26:30.365
She's supposed to be marriage material,

26:30.450 --> 26:31.988
not his Mexican hooker.

26:32.018 --> 26:33.651
- Rachel, it's my turn.
- Can you... just one second.

26:33.737 --> 26:35.102
Want to take it to my bedroom?

26:35.151 --> 26:36.910
Yeah. Let's go.

26:36.940 --> 26:38.106
Let's go.

26:38.225 --> 26:39.947
- All right, come on.
- Uh...

26:39.977 --> 26:42.082
- Come on. Let's go, big boy.
- W-Wha... I'm... I'm just...

26:42.112 --> 26:43.850
Uh, I will be with you
in a sec. I just, uh...

26:43.880 --> 26:45.419
- Come on.
- What are you...

26:45.449 --> 26:47.482
Okay, I'll... I'll just be right here.

26:52.222 --> 26:54.328
Darling, if you wanted
to cop a feel, just ask.

26:54.358 --> 26:56.680
You know something? I'm just
trying to take your mike off, okay?

26:56.710 --> 26:58.682
Otherwise, they can hear everything, FYI.

26:58.712 --> 27:00.378
Um, you can't do that.

27:00.630 --> 27:01.235
Do what?

27:01.265 --> 27:02.686
The first time that we're getting anything

27:02.716 --> 27:05.038
resembling chemistry off
of you, it's only for Grace.

27:05.068 --> 27:06.137
I mean, y-y-you...

27:06.167 --> 27:08.008
you cannot bang her on
the first night, okay?

27:08.038 --> 27:09.014
She's the hottest one here,

27:09.044 --> 27:10.177
and you're saying that I can't be into her?

27:10.207 --> 27:11.928
- Right.
- That's ridiculous.

27:11.958 --> 27:15.210
Have you never had to play
by anybody else's rules?

27:15.615 --> 27:18.496
Oh, okay. I get it. So
you're just a spoiled brat.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.737
Now it's making so much more sense.

27:20.767 --> 27:21.500
I get it.

27:21.530 --> 27:23.184
- What?
- I just...

27:23.214 --> 27:25.259
Women don't usually talk to me like that.

27:25.289 --> 27:28.178
Oh, because you're so
devastatingly attractive.

27:28.208 --> 27:29.762
- And the accent, yeah.
- Oh.

27:29.792 --> 27:30.492
I kind of like it, though,

27:30.522 --> 27:32.127
- the way you're busting my balls like this.
- Don't do that, okay?

27:32.157 --> 27:33.912
- Huh? Sure? 
- Okay? Mnh-mnh... Can we... Whoa, no.

27:33.942 --> 27:36.247
Let's just stay on topic, shall we?

27:36.333 --> 27:38.489
Fine.

27:38.519 --> 27:42.125
Uh, to your question, no,
I never follow the rules,

27:42.155 --> 27:44.572
and I don't plan on
following these ones, either.

27:44.908 --> 27:46.157
It's a farce.

27:46.276 --> 27:47.997
It's like the... the... the rodeo girl,

27:48.027 --> 27:48.843
- Mm-hmm.
- Faith.

27:48.873 --> 27:52.063
She's only here to be
the butt of some joke.

27:54.384 --> 27:55.463
Do you want to do something

27:55.499 --> 27:57.836
that'll fully flip
Quinn out, something big?

27:59.844 --> 28:00.892
Maybe.

28:04.382 --> 28:05.875
Final touches, please.

28:05.905 --> 28:07.877
32 minutes till sunrise.

28:07.907 --> 28:09.545
Everyone, back to your marks.

28:09.575 --> 28:10.780
Thanks for showing up.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.298
Sound speed. Camera speed.

28:12.328 --> 28:13.463
Sorry. I've been running
around out there with those...

28:13.493 --> 28:17.387
- On your call, madam.
- Okay. And...action.

28:17.724 --> 28:21.411
Ladies, as you know,
when Adam calls your name,

28:21.737 --> 28:24.955
you can come up and
proceed to our safe zone

28:25.190 --> 28:27.190
and have a glass of champagne.

28:27.699 --> 28:29.865
But if your name is not called, ladies,

28:29.895 --> 28:32.821
sadly, your fairytale ends tonight.

28:32.851 --> 28:35.938
You'll return the bracelets and,
of course, say your goodbyes.

28:35.968 --> 28:38.969
- Adam, are you ready?
- Yes.

28:39.105 --> 28:41.176
Stage is yours.

28:41.557 --> 28:43.724
This decision has been very difficult.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.192
You are all exceptional.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.262
Shamiqua.

28:48.381 --> 28:51.721
Yes, white boy! You get that brown sugar.

28:51.751 --> 28:53.701
Whatever. Three episodes tops.

28:53.731 --> 28:57.238
Hey, mo... new girl, move, move. Thank you.

28:57.273 --> 28:58.478
Shamiqua, will you stay, please?

28:58.508 --> 29:00.424
I would be honored. Thank you.

29:00.454 --> 29:02.476
Okay, here we go. I need Camera Eight.

29:02.506 --> 29:03.913
Push in on the MILFY.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.096
Keep it there, please.

29:05.181 --> 29:06.543
Mary.

29:07.683 --> 29:09.016
Mary, will you stay, please?

29:09.300 --> 29:10.309
Yes, I will.

29:15.941 --> 29:17.357
Violet.

29:17.442 --> 29:18.608
Violet, will you say, please?

29:18.638 --> 29:19.838
Rose.

29:19.868 --> 29:20.880
Rose, will you stay, please?

29:20.910 --> 29:21.960
Rita. Rita, will you stay, please?

29:21.990 --> 29:23.105
Maya. Maya, will you stay, please?

29:23.135 --> 29:24.140
Crystal. Crystal, will you stay, please?

29:24.170 --> 29:27.033
Joy. Pepper. Grace. Anna.

29:27.228 --> 29:29.920
- Anna, will you stay, please?
- Yes.

29:29.950 --> 29:31.668
Okay, here we go, everyone. Last one.

29:31.698 --> 29:34.897
I need Loser Cam on Manly Rodeo Queen,

29:34.927 --> 29:37.478
and I need Camera Nine to
repo to evil bitch Britney.

29:37.596 --> 29:39.719
She's gonna win this, people.

29:42.985 --> 29:44.283
Okay.

29:47.822 --> 29:48.939
Faith.

29:50.292 --> 29:51.213
- What?
- What?

29:51.243 --> 29:52.414
What?!

29:52.444 --> 29:53.523
No!

29:53.553 --> 29:55.243
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:55.273 --> 29:56.635
No. This is not happening.

29:56.665 --> 29:58.999
My God! Oh, my God!

29:59.135 --> 30:02.055
Oh, my Gosh!

30:02.085 --> 30:04.416
Oh, my gosh!

30:04.446 --> 30:06.962
Oh, my gosh!

30:06.992 --> 30:08.559
Faith, will you stay, please?

30:09.961 --> 30:11.452
Yeah.

30:12.194 --> 30:13.480
Thank you.

30:13.566 --> 30:15.116
Aww.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.350
Oh!

30:20.256 --> 30:23.023
Oh, screw this!

30:23.159 --> 30:24.691
Repo Cam. We got a runner, people.

30:24.727 --> 30:25.809
Camera "A," follow Britney.

30:25.839 --> 30:26.832
Copy that.

30:26.862 --> 30:28.896
- Cut! Cut!

30:28.981 --> 30:30.254
Hold the roll!

30:30.284 --> 30:31.684
I'm pissed, too, Britney.

30:33.236 --> 30:35.915
You, follow me, now.

30:35.945 --> 30:37.704
Hey, pretty boy, come here, please.

30:39.408 --> 30:40.736
Hi. Yeah.

30:40.766 --> 30:43.559
Um, listen, you cut my villain,

30:43.589 --> 30:45.321
and I can't make a television show

30:45.351 --> 30:47.052
without a villain.

30:47.082 --> 30:48.782
Did you know about this?

30:48.917 --> 30:50.352
Oh, no, that wasn't her.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.364
I just did what I felt in my heart.

30:53.493 --> 30:55.424
Your heart? Please.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.997
Okay, don't worry about it, all right?

30:57.027 --> 30:58.626
I got it. It's gonna be good TV.

30:58.656 --> 31:00.377
Hello?! Get out of here!

31:00.462 --> 31:01.714
I'm off the freakin' show!

31:01.744 --> 31:03.184
All right, just... just...
just keep it on her, okay?

31:03.214 --> 31:06.509
- Keep it on her.
- Stand down! Stand down!

31:06.539 --> 31:10.529
Britney. Britney, you listen to me, okay?

31:10.559 --> 31:15.018
If you walk away right now,
they're gonna get the last word.

31:16.206 --> 31:18.979
Is that what you want?

31:21.450 --> 31:23.083
Come on.

31:29.708 --> 31:31.081
There you go.

31:33.184 --> 31:34.795
Do you feel good?

31:35.397 --> 31:36.680
I feel great.

31:36.765 --> 31:39.333
Eh. Okay.

31:39.363 --> 31:41.965
- I got it. Thank you.
- You look really pretty.

31:41.995 --> 31:43.804
Well, isn't that ironic?

31:43.989 --> 31:45.277
You ready to shoot?

31:45.307 --> 31:47.724
Yeah. I can't wait.

31:49.056 --> 31:50.527
Are we rolling?

31:51.035 --> 31:53.063
Okay.

31:55.416 --> 31:58.666
Why don't you just tell me
what happened here tonight?

32:02.491 --> 32:04.844
He's such a great guy,

32:04.874 --> 32:08.307
and I've had a lovely time on the show.

32:12.272 --> 32:14.334
And I'm gonna repeat that on loop

32:14.364 --> 32:19.590
until you let me go home, Rachel.

32:22.889 --> 32:25.812
Um, uh, Rachel? Rachel?

32:27.976 --> 32:31.410
One second, all right?
Just give me one sec.

32:31.581 --> 32:33.412
Take your time.

32:34.113 --> 32:35.449
Go for Rachel.

32:35.479 --> 32:38.005
Rachel, uh, I don't know
if this is gonna be helpful

32:38.035 --> 32:41.560
but Subject 21 was adopted

32:41.590 --> 32:43.450
and was in foster care for years.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.556
Uh, she was emancipated at 16, and...

32:46.586 --> 32:50.800
oh, she was in, uh, uh, she
was in a psych ward twice.

32:50.830 --> 32:53.123
And yet you let her on the show?

32:53.153 --> 32:54.897
- Oh. Um, I... Okay, Rachel, I...
- No, just cut out.

32:54.927 --> 32:56.093
Just let go. Let go of the button.

32:56.178 --> 32:58.095
- I...
- Let go!

32:58.606 --> 33:01.014
Never mind.

33:11.297 --> 33:12.767
We good?

33:21.934 --> 33:23.806
Okay, you know what? I don't... I don't...

33:23.836 --> 33:28.031
I don't want to be doing this
crap any more than you do.

33:28.061 --> 33:30.015
I don't. Jeremy, can you just stop?

33:30.045 --> 33:31.058
Stop filming, please.

33:31.088 --> 33:33.280
Just turn... put the camera down, okay?

33:33.310 --> 33:35.562
Stop rolling. We're finished.

33:35.592 --> 33:39.877
Just... I... I, uh...
God, that feels so good.

33:40.629 --> 33:41.657
Wow, okay.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.206
I just... Can someone get me a drink?

33:44.236 --> 33:46.282
Can somebody get me a drink, please?!

33:46.312 --> 33:47.648
I, uh...

33:47.678 --> 33:48.733
I'm on it.

33:48.763 --> 33:50.663
Oh, my God.

33:52.318 --> 33:54.201
Come on.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.453
Come on.

33:56.704 --> 33:58.989
- Yeah, okay.
- Come on.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.621
Oh, my God. Sunrise sucks.

34:03.651 --> 34:06.316
Can somebody please get us a drink today?

34:06.346 --> 34:07.359
What?

34:07.389 --> 34:08.880
- Thank you.
- What is Rachel doing?

34:08.909 --> 34:09.815
Thank you.

34:09.846 --> 34:11.818
You're welcome.

34:19.882 --> 34:23.746
Everybody judges you.
It's, like, so unfair.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.849
- Me? 
- Mm-hmm.

34:26.453 --> 34:28.101
No.

34:28.130 --> 34:29.213
No.

34:29.243 --> 34:31.554
I...

34:31.639 --> 34:33.379
I judge everyone.

34:33.409 --> 34:36.147
No, you're a total softie, I can tell.

34:36.177 --> 34:38.370
Right? You probably...

34:38.400 --> 34:41.137
You probably like, like, dogs, and puppies,

34:41.167 --> 34:43.679
and rainbows, and unicorns.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.202
Am I right?

34:45.337 --> 34:48.623
You're the only person on
the planet that thinks that.

34:49.581 --> 34:53.049
I'm sure your parents see
your tender little heart.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.735
- What?
- Nothing. Never mind.

34:56.764 --> 34:58.215
Anyways...

35:01.243 --> 35:04.218
From one slut to another.

35:04.921 --> 35:06.011
Cheers.

35:06.041 --> 35:07.896
Did you just call me a slut?

35:07.926 --> 35:10.135
Okay. I can use that. I can use that.

35:10.165 --> 35:13.375
No. I just called myself a slut.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.266
Right.

35:18.085 --> 35:19.378
Hey, listen.

35:19.408 --> 35:25.538
Um, did he...did he say something to you?

35:25.829 --> 35:28.311
Adam? Mm...

35:28.721 --> 35:33.127
Like, not... not super specifically...

35:33.157 --> 35:37.014
I mean, but, you know, you
did come on kind of strong.

35:38.635 --> 35:39.769
You told me to.

35:39.799 --> 35:41.296
- I did not tell you...
- Yes, you...

35:41.326 --> 35:43.372
to, like, French him and grab his ass.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.016
Wow.

35:47.969 --> 35:50.467
You're something else, Rachel.

35:51.309 --> 35:53.286
I don't know. Do you think
that you're, like, forward

35:53.316 --> 35:55.290
because of, um...

35:55.786 --> 35:57.925
things that happened in your upbringing?

35:59.600 --> 36:00.927
What are you talking about?

36:01.012 --> 36:02.967
I was just saying that, like,

36:02.997 --> 36:04.386
you know, when bad things go down,

36:04.416 --> 36:08.574
sometimes your kid brain
computes it as, like, um...

36:08.604 --> 36:10.843
I don't know.

36:10.873 --> 36:13.373
"I must be unlovable."

36:32.737 --> 36:34.843
Heads up.

36:43.294 --> 36:47.140
I am...

36:48.354 --> 36:51.209
completely...

36:51.585 --> 36:54.012
loveable.

37:02.169 --> 37:05.379
Burn in hell, you witch!

37:14.757 --> 37:17.185
All of you, just burn in hell!

37:22.723 --> 37:24.223
Damn, that was good.

37:24.961 --> 37:27.161
We can use that in a promo.

37:27.447 --> 37:29.048
Rachel's back.

37:30.731 --> 37:33.249
What did I tell you?

37:33.279 --> 37:35.498
You always make it work.

37:51.896 --> 37:55.025
Oh, hey. So, how was your first night?

37:55.055 --> 37:58.154
Crazy. I'm so tired.

37:58.184 --> 38:00.668
I don't think I peed or
sat down once all night.

38:00.698 --> 38:02.275
Yeah, that's how it goes.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.777
You know, adrenaline
makes some people loco.

38:04.862 --> 38:06.695
Yeah. Um...

38:06.725 --> 38:09.582
I kind of heard some
talk today about Rachel.

38:10.759 --> 38:13.202
Jeremy never told you what happened?

38:13.629 --> 38:15.204
Really?

38:15.234 --> 38:17.089
Well, you're his fiancée.

38:17.119 --> 38:20.098
You should see it, 'cause it's epic.

38:25.688 --> 38:28.571
Claire, the last eight weeks
have been the best of my life.

38:28.601 --> 38:29.719
The things that we've shared,

38:29.749 --> 38:33.222
the experiences that we've
had, have brought us so close.

38:33.308 --> 38:36.517
Other things that we did, the...

38:36.547 --> 38:38.672
Rachel, no!

38:38.702 --> 38:39.729
past...

38:39.814 --> 38:41.558
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

38:41.588 --> 38:43.926
This job...

38:44.336 --> 38:47.069
this job is Satan's asshole!

38:47.099 --> 38:48.166
- Rachel, don't do this!
- What are you doing?

38:48.196 --> 38:49.492
- Are you crazy?
- I...

38:49.522 --> 38:51.040
- Oh, hell.
- Are you at of your mind?

38:51.070 --> 38:54.243
You. My God, you... Claire.

38:54.273 --> 38:56.156
Claire, you're somebody's child.

38:56.186 --> 38:57.675
No, Rachel, Rachel, don't do this!

38:57.705 --> 38:58.717
- Hm?
- What are you doing?

38:58.747 --> 39:01.345
- Don't do this.
- Let her go.

39:01.909 --> 39:03.221
He's about to dump you.

39:03.251 --> 39:04.537
No.

39:04.567 --> 39:06.222
- Is that true?!
- No, no!

39:06.252 --> 39:07.340
You're dumping me?!

39:08.926 --> 39:10.059
Oh, my God.

39:10.144 --> 39:11.778
They didn't air this.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.263
No, no, they cut crazy pants

39:14.293 --> 39:16.599
and made it look like the
dumped girl goes mental...

39:16.629 --> 39:18.647
huge finale ratings.

39:18.677 --> 39:20.931
I swear, Rachel slips in
shit and lands in money.

39:20.961 --> 39:22.655
Give me the keys! Don't! Hey, hey, hey!

39:24.108 --> 39:25.741
Hey! Hey, stop! Stop! I'm not gonna move.

39:25.827 --> 39:26.881
No, no.

39:26.911 --> 39:28.160
You're taking me with you.

39:28.279 --> 39:31.163
Wait, wait. Rach! Rachel! Wait!

39:32.394 --> 39:33.949
We can use that.

39:33.979 --> 39:35.077
Hey, Jeremy.

39:35.107 --> 39:37.670
Crazy in the head, crazy in bed, right?

39:50.601 --> 39:51.934
What?

39:51.964 --> 39:54.042
None of you have ever had a bad day?

39:55.423 --> 39:57.203
Get out.

39:58.933 --> 40:00.732
All right, come on, you
guys, let's go sign out.

40:00.762 --> 40:04.048
Hey, uh, yeah, you just...
you didn't have to do that.

40:04.078 --> 40:07.898
Yes, I did. I need your head in the game.

40:08.547 --> 40:11.520
Okay, um, can you just sign this paperwork

40:11.606 --> 40:14.023
saying that I showed up
to work on time and sober?

40:14.108 --> 40:16.192
'Cause, um, I have to catch a bus

40:16.277 --> 40:18.627
to community service, and then therapy.

40:18.657 --> 40:21.919
Oh, my God, it hurts,
actually, to be this fabulous.

40:21.949 --> 40:24.283
Actually, you don't. I handled it.

40:24.313 --> 40:26.335
You handled what, Quinn?

40:27.388 --> 40:29.622
What? The D.U.I., or grand theft auto?

40:29.707 --> 40:32.397
Because neither of those
things can actually be handled.

40:32.427 --> 40:35.094
And yet it's handled.

40:36.316 --> 40:40.066
All right, um, look, the therapy
was actually kind of helping.

40:40.151 --> 40:42.518
Uh, one, you're fine, and, two,

40:42.604 --> 40:44.854
I had the courts transfer
your "psychiatric care"

40:44.939 --> 40:46.105
to Wagerstein.

40:46.135 --> 40:47.907
To Wagerstein?

40:47.992 --> 40:49.719
That woman's crazy.

40:49.749 --> 40:52.245
That woman is here, okay?

40:52.330 --> 40:54.268
So you can go whenever you want.

40:55.926 --> 40:58.199
I need my dragon well-rested.

41:01.383 --> 41:03.021
You know, if you really
wanted me well-rested,

41:03.051 --> 41:05.708
you could, um... you
could just get the show

41:05.738 --> 41:08.066
to drop the charges.

41:08.512 --> 41:10.558
I mean, you guys got the car back,

41:10.588 --> 41:13.704
and... and I'm... and I'm paying
off all of the damages, and...

41:15.103 --> 41:16.435
You know, the threat of jail time,

41:16.521 --> 41:19.889
that's not exactly
helping me sleep at night.

41:20.658 --> 41:22.642
I know.

41:22.672 --> 41:23.893
But before I can do that,

41:23.978 --> 41:26.795
I need to see that you
have learned from this,

41:27.342 --> 41:28.981
and that you can change.

41:29.117 --> 41:31.400
Believe it or not...

41:31.655 --> 41:32.952
I care about you.

41:35.392 --> 41:36.514
That's funny, 'cause right now,

41:36.544 --> 41:39.125
it feels a little like blackmail.

41:42.048 --> 41:43.517
How far do you want that track?

41:43.547 --> 41:45.298
All right.

41:48.722 --> 41:51.537
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- Oh.

41:52.390 --> 41:54.173
Thank you.

42:00.304 --> 42:01.585
Don't say anything.

42:01.615 --> 42:04.071
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
- Yeah, but you're talking.

42:12.464 --> 42:14.117
Here.

42:14.147 --> 42:16.018
- Jim Leblanc!
- Here.

42:16.048 --> 42:19.472
Rachel Goldberg! Rachel Goldberg!

42:19.502 --> 42:22.851
Oh, that... that's me. Uh...

42:23.214 --> 42:24.519
Hm.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.197
Here.

42:27.227 --> 42:30.309
All right, ladies. Head up to your rooms.

42:35.157 --> 42:36.473
What's going on?

42:36.503 --> 42:38.456
Just shut up.
