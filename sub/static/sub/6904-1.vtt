00:33.908 --> 00:35.242
Billions of years ago...

00:35.410 --> 00:40.039
...a race of immortals harnessed
the most powerful force in existence:

00:40.290 --> 00:43.667
The emerald energy of willpower.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.253
These immortals,
the Guardians of the Universe...

00:46.421 --> 00:49.798
...built a world from where they could
watch over all of existence:

00:49.966 --> 00:52.342
The planet Oa.

00:53.178 --> 00:57.431
They divided the universe
into 3600 sectors.

00:57.599 --> 01:03.103
A ring powered by the energy of will
was sent to every sector to select a recruit.

01:03.772 --> 01:08.650
In order to be chosen by the ring,
it was said one must be without fear.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.779
Together, these 3600 recruits...

01:11.946 --> 01:17.910
...formed the intergalactic peacekeepers
known as the Green Lantern Corps.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.630
Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...

01:29.798 --> 01:33.967
...the gravest was an entity of fear
known as Parallax.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.678
Only the legendary Green Lantern
Abin Sur...

01:36.846 --> 01:40.182
...was capable of capturing
and imprisoning this beast...

01:40.350 --> 01:44.144
...which he did on the lost planet of Ryut.

02:03.206 --> 02:08.043
COMMANDER

03:12.400 --> 03:14.610
You are afraid.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.737
Good.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.825
I mean, we go into this every time.
It's not every time.

04:44.993 --> 04:48.787
No, honey. Think back.
Think back. Think back.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.457
I was fine the last time. I'm usually fine.
I'm fine with your work.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.461
Can I just tell you something?
- Of course you can.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.174
I'm scared, honey.
Shh, shh.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.326
Is everything okay?

05:27.869 --> 05:31.204
Oh, you know how Mom gets
the night before a test flight.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.542
But you're not scared, are you, Dad?

05:37.754 --> 05:40.797
Let's just say it's my job not to be.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.470
Good night, son.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.602
Hal, you're gonna be late.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.897
Good morning, Mom. Gotta go.

07:15.059 --> 07:19.104
Dad! Dad! Dad!

07:23.651 --> 07:27.320
You think she'll break mach 3?
- We'll find out soon enough.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.573
Hey, shouldn't you be in school?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.701
Mr. Ferris raised the rear stabilizer.

07:33.953 --> 07:34.995
Yes, he did.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.248
The yaw rate gyros are calibrated,
but the pitch is off 2 degrees.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.418
I can live with that. How about the INS?
- Good to go.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.794
Okay.
Johnny.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.464
Be sure to check the ignition sequences.
- No problem.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.048
We did, Carl, twice.
- Right.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.510
And, uh, the gyros?
Did we do the gyro calibrations?

07:58.436 --> 07:59.686
Hey, Carl.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.898
Maybe Hal would like to join Carol
up in your office.

08:03.065 --> 08:07.736
The two of them can watch together.
- Come on, young man. Let's go find Carol.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.029
Hal.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.495
Keep it warm for me.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.335
Hi.
- Oh, hey, Hector.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.631
Hey. So, um, I have this book.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.217
It's about the possibility
of life on other planets.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.261
Cool.
- Well, it almost has to exist, but...

08:34.597 --> 08:36.765
Hal!
- Hey, Carol.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.643
Hector. You still wanna
trade Hot Wheels?

08:39.809 --> 08:41.227
Sure.

08:41.979 --> 08:45.524
Well, look who's here.
Our future test pilot.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.359
Jacket suits you, son.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.902
Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.113
I keep telling Hector, books are fun,
but every once in a while...

08:52.281 --> 08:55.575
...it's not such a bad idea to get
out in the world, right, Hal?

08:55.743 --> 08:58.286
Hey, Bob.
- The man of the hour.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.373
Nothing like a first flight
to get the blood boiling, eh, Carl?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.542
Dad, can we watch
from down in the field?

09:03.709 --> 09:05.377
Sure.
Yes!

09:06.254 --> 09:08.672
You kids be careful.
Stay with the engineers.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.799
Go on, son. See it up close.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.135
That's okay, Dad. I'll be fine.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.306
Ferris Tower, Sabre One,
ready for take-off.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.309
Request unrestricted climb,
flight level 450.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.526
Yes! Yes!

09:29.819 --> 09:32.028
Sabre One,
unrestricted climb approved.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.781
On passing 10,000 feet,
contact Ferris Departure.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.951
You're cleared for take-off.
Good luck, Sabre.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.404
Whoo! Yeah, Dad!

12:53.272 --> 12:57.776
Sinestro, I'm traveling at maximum velocity.
Tell Fentara I should...

12:57.943 --> 12:59.402
Fentara is dead.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.948
The planet's inhabitants?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.576
Your mission to evacuate them
is no longer necessary.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.204
It's just as it was on Talok.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.624
Every life form destroyed
and their essence absorbed.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.959
Traces of yellow power everywhere.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.461
And the Guardians?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.088
The Guardians are silent.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.299
I've demanded an audience with them.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.435
Abin Sur.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.613
I'm badly wounded.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.660
Heading to the nearest inhabited planet
for the selection process.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.497
Tell the Guardians it's Parallax.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.681
No. No.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.356
Sorry, I gotta run.
Make yourself at home, okay?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.275
There's, uh, water in the tap.

15:27.384 --> 15:28.635
No!

15:29.386 --> 15:30.470
Yup.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.018
Asshole.

15:38.395 --> 15:43.691
The Ferris Sabre llI is state-of-the-art
of artificial-intelligence fighter planes.

15:43.859 --> 15:47.695
It has all of the flying and combat
capability of a human pilot...

15:48.155 --> 15:50.990
...but with none of the human error
that comes with it.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.160
Carl isn't just blowing smoke
to get a contract, general.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.371
Your staff, these contractors, my office...

15:56.538 --> 15:58.915
...we've all been part of this
from the ground up.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.917
Well, I appreciate that, senator.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.169
But today the rubber meets the road.

16:03.337 --> 16:08.341
We have a simulated combat situation.
Two Sabres against Carl's two best pilots.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.944
Carol. Was gonna do a little flying today.
What do you think?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.362
I think you're late.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.614
Yes, but that's only because I slept in.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.783
I used to sleep in. Then I turned 11.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.827
Let me give you a little heads-up.

16:35.994 --> 16:39.414
I've gone up against these Sabres all week
and they smoked me every time.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.959
There isn't anything you can do that
they can't do better, faster...

16:43.127 --> 16:45.420
...and without disappointing women
everywhere.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.964
I, uh, think we both know that's not true.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.551
This is exactly why I didn't want you
for this. My father did.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.136
I would've gone with Jensen.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.973
I'd have too, but unfortunately
he's busy not being good enough.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.683
At least he shows up.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.351
Hal...

17:00.519 --> 17:02.478
...this test today, it's important.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.481
I'm gonna make you look good up there.
Don't worry, okay?

17:05.648 --> 17:09.277
Now let's get these pants off
and fly some planes.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.156
Highball, weapon check now.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.657
Roger that.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.788
Good morning, Mr. Ferris.
Morning, everybody.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.499
Gentlemen.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.003
We about ready, Tom?
- Yes, Mr. Ferris. We are go for test.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.174
Sapphire, cleared weapons hot
at the merge.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.968
Ferris Test, Sapphire. Weapons are hot.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.928
Fly safe, Highball.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.181
Um, no.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.861
Goddamn it!
Tom, what the hell you feed those things?

17:52.279 --> 17:53.696
F-35s, what else?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.830
Wakey, wakey, Sapphire.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.999
You got a shot,
now would be a great time.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.085
Easy, Highball. Just lining it up.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.227
There's no way
we're taking these out solo.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.646
Get over here.
Let's figure something out.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.148
On my way, Highball.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.823
Now stay right there and look real pretty.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.515
Highball, did you just use your wingman
as a decoy?

19:24.705 --> 19:28.624
Highball, those Sabres headed up your 6
can fly anywhere you can.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.710
Then let's go somewhere I can't fly.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.716
What the hell is he up to?

19:37.217 --> 19:38.259
Coffin corner.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.139
Highball, rules of engagement
set ceiling at 50,000 feet.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.601
Yeah, because the Sabres will stall
if they go any higher, right, Tom?

19:46.768 --> 19:47.977
And so will you.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.319
Compressor stall. Compressor stall.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.358
Yes!

20:40.197 --> 20:43.199
Um, I mean, damn it, Hal.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.993
Your boy certainly
takes his job seriously.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.622
Ailerons, Hal. Side to side.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.831
I got it.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.295
Hal.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.219
Keep it warm for me.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.014
Going through 25,000.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.392
Hey, you okay, Highball?

21:10.435 --> 21:12.228
Yeah, just taking my victory lap.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.571
Going through 20,000.
- Okay, Highball, give me some roll.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.372
Yeah, Dad!

21:32.582 --> 21:34.041
Hal, do you read me?

21:43.677 --> 21:46.762
Highball, you're approaching
minimum ejection altitude.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.603
Highball, you're below 10,000 AGL.
Spin is unrecoverable.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.189
Eject, eject, eject!

21:58.233 --> 22:00.359
You're not scared, are you, Dad?

22:00.944 --> 22:03.362
Let's just say it's my job not to be.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.453
Dad!

22:14.082 --> 22:15.374
Dad!

22:35.270 --> 22:36.979
You stupid son of a bitch. You...

22:37.147 --> 22:39.190
Stand down, Bob. It doesn't matter now.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.524
It does matter.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.611
Never mind that you crashed
a brand-new F-35.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.655
You broke the rules of engagement.
You sacrificed your wingman.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.450
And you blew the contract
this company was depending on.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.577
I'm sorry. I thought this was a dogfight.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.246
I was under the impression
the objective was to win.

22:54.414 --> 22:57.500
No, the objective was to show
what the Sabres could do in combat.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.628
And in combat,
no pilot is gonna crater his own plane.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.463
I did.

23:03.381 --> 23:07.009
Now you know you gotta boost the ceiling.
I showed you what they can't do.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.845
You didn't have to make that point
in front of Air Force Acquisitions.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.263
That's enough, Carol.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.977
Since I'm gonna have to lay off most of
my company anyway, you're fired, Hal.

23:17.145 --> 23:18.270
It's too late. I quit.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.064
He's not fired and you don't quit.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.858
You're grounded,
pending the results of an investigation.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.034
Watch your back.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.661
That's impossible, Bob.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.045
Tell me what happened.
- Controls locked up.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.632
Don't give me that, Hal. You had a
window when you could've recovered.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.342
Did you choke?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.636
You wouldn't be the first,
but I need to know.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.514
My controls locked up.
What the hell is all this, anyway?

23:53.682 --> 23:55.182
What's with the ridiculous suit?

23:55.350 --> 23:59.103
I know your dad's been bucking for you...
- The merits of my career choices...

23:59.271 --> 24:03.482
You're a pilot, and a good one.
Giving that up to fly a desk is bullshit.

24:03.650 --> 24:04.984
I like it and I'm good at it.

24:05.152 --> 24:08.863
Doesn't mean I'll never get in a cockpit
again. It isn't one way or the other.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.449
That's the way a child looks at things,
and we aren't children anymore.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.494
At least...

24:19.583 --> 24:22.668
I just don't wanna see
someone I care about getting hurt.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.421
Least of all you.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.753
Choose well.

25:30.278 --> 25:33.155
A test pilot's daring maneuvers
almost ended in tragedy.

25:33.323 --> 25:37.785
Witnesses say pilot Hal Jordan
ejected at the last possible second...

25:37.953 --> 25:40.037
...before his jet crashed
in the open desert.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.122
He's the son of the late Martin Jordan...

25:42.290 --> 25:45.334
...who was killed in his own
ill-fated test flight back in 1993.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.045
We are told that Hal Jordan
is doing fine right now...

25:48.213 --> 25:51.048
...though we have yet to hear
an official statement.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.257
Hey, guys.

25:52.425 --> 25:56.011
The incident has been a blow
to a new high-tech aircraft program...

25:56.179 --> 25:57.596
Hey. How was work?

25:57.764 --> 26:00.349
Oh. It was amazing, Jack.
Thank you for asking. Hey, Janice.

26:00.517 --> 26:03.644
Just help me out here, because
I'm really trying to understand this.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.688
Mm-hm.
- Do you wanna be like him so bad?

26:05.855 --> 26:08.107
You just assume it's my fault.
- I talked to Carl.

26:08.274 --> 26:10.401
Oh. Heh, heh.
- You pushed the plane past its limits...

26:10.568 --> 26:13.362
That's my job. It was an accident.
Everybody walked away.

26:13.530 --> 26:17.032
Like your motorcycle accident
that put you in the hospital for a month?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.910
I miss all this quality family time.
Good talk, Jack.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.757
Where's Jason?

26:34.509 --> 26:35.884
In his room.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.594
Why?

26:40.640 --> 26:41.932
Hey, it's Uncle Hal.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.184
What's up there, ace?

26:44.352 --> 26:48.105
This is the worst 11 th birthday party
I've ever been to.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.691
No dancing girls?
What's going on...? Hey.

26:51.609 --> 26:53.193
Hey.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.654
I'm fine.

26:55.822 --> 26:58.198
I guess I got a little freaked out
or something.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.242
It happens.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.493
Not to you.

27:01.911 --> 27:03.412
Look...

27:04.247 --> 27:06.290
...you don't have anything
to worry about.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.499
You wanna know why?

27:07.917 --> 27:11.503
Yeah, I may be a total screw-up
in every other part of my life...

27:11.671 --> 27:15.716
...but the one thing I do know
how to do is fly.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.137
You know, I used to know this kid.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.765
Was a funny-looking little bastard.

27:22.932 --> 27:26.852
One day, he's standing on the mound,
and he throws a perfect game.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.022
That... That was me.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.066
That was you?

27:34.402 --> 27:36.445
Thought you looked familiar.

27:37.489 --> 27:42.117
You were totally in the zone that day.
Remember?

27:43.870 --> 27:46.872
I still dream about it.
- I bet.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.625
Take it.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.585
Close your eyes.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.129
Go on.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.136
Now...

28:02.138 --> 28:04.431
...can you remember
exactly how you felt that day?

28:06.976 --> 28:09.812
That's how I feel when I'm flying.

28:10.271 --> 28:12.439
Like that plane is a part of me.

28:12.607 --> 28:16.819
No, it's like,
no matter how bad things get...

28:17.278 --> 28:21.490
...there's something good out there...

28:21.658 --> 28:23.992
...just over the horizon.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.874
I could really feel it.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.961
Yeah.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.547
Me too.

28:44.055 --> 28:48.976
Hey, got you something, birthday boy.
Wrapped it myself.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.358
Cool. It's an X-1, right?

28:56.526 --> 28:59.611
It's a Starfighter. My dad gave me that.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.446
Let's put it up.

29:03.658 --> 29:05.284
What happened today?

29:05.451 --> 29:07.119
I mean, when you crashed.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.204
Not really sure, exactly.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.624
Were you scared?

29:14.794 --> 29:16.461
It's my job not to be.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.967
You know, you're totally missing
your super-lame birthday party.

29:22.135 --> 29:25.721
Beat it. Go, go, go!

29:27.974 --> 29:30.142
I'm glad you're okay.

29:33.479 --> 29:35.564
Me too, ace.

29:49.829 --> 29:51.079
Get off! No!

29:54.000 --> 29:55.667
Aah! No!

30:57.397 --> 31:01.191
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
I'm gonna get you some help.

31:01.359 --> 31:04.861
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay. Okay, hold on.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.322
Your name. Your name.

31:07.490 --> 31:10.158
It's Hal. Hal Jordan.

31:10.326 --> 31:15.247
Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur,
protector of Sector 2814.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.665
Okay, hey, listen.

31:16.833 --> 31:22.296
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
Okay? One that carries purple blood.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.881
The ring...

31:25.049 --> 31:26.550
...it chose you.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.218
Take it!

31:28.720 --> 31:32.639
Place the ring in the lantern.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.392
Place the ring, speak the oath...

31:35.810 --> 31:38.020
What?
- Great honor, responsibility...

31:38.187 --> 31:40.772
I don't understand.
Breathe. You gotta breathe, okay?

31:40.940 --> 31:43.400
All you gotta do is breathe.
Just breathe, okay?

31:43.568 --> 31:46.069
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Hey, hey.

31:46.654 --> 31:50.073
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
No, no, no, don't do that.

31:50.575 --> 31:54.036
Hey, now, don't do that.

31:54.912 --> 31:56.913
Oh, come on.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.596
X-97 systems check complete.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.269
Yo.

32:21.814 --> 32:22.856
Come again?

32:40.875 --> 32:41.958
Hmm.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.086
Is that a spaceship?

32:44.504 --> 32:45.796
Yeah.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.465
Is it real?

32:49.550 --> 32:50.801
It's real.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.804
Did you see what kind of power source
this thing uses?

32:53.971 --> 32:55.764
Do you understand...?
- We can't stay.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.182
We can't stay here.
- What?

32:57.350 --> 32:59.226
Gotta go.
- What?

32:59.936 --> 33:00.977
Pilot.

33:01.312 --> 33:04.231
He wore a uniform.
I think he was a soldier.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.233
He gave me this.

33:06.901 --> 33:07.943
He proposed?

33:13.408 --> 33:15.742
We're gone. We're gone, now!

33:31.259 --> 33:34.761
They're gonna know someone was there.
Alien pilots don't bury themselves.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.513
I couldn't just leave him there.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.307
I hope this thing isn't radioactive.

33:39.892 --> 33:42.519
Yeah, well, you're the genius. You... Aah!
- Aah!

33:42.687 --> 33:44.354
Jesus!
- Aah! Whoa!

33:47.608 --> 33:48.942
Got it!

33:50.445 --> 33:53.655
He said that the ring chose me.

33:53.823 --> 33:57.200
He said it was a great honor.
Responsibility.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.702
Responsibility?

33:58.870 --> 33:59.870
Yeah.
- You?

34:02.707 --> 34:06.209
Well, maybe on their planet
"responsibility" just means "asshole. "

34:07.086 --> 34:08.545
Let's hope so.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.728
A great light has gone out
in the universe.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.313
Abin Sur is dead.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.985
Four of my Lantern brothers killed.

34:33.237 --> 34:37.574
The inhabitants of two worlds
annihilated by an unknown enemy.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.869
An enemy that possesses
the yellow power of fear.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.793
We know it originated from
within the Lost Sector.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.380
We know it grows more powerful
with each encounter.

34:53.341 --> 34:57.761
According to Abin Sur's last transmission,
he seemed to know what it was.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.848
His only words were, "It's Parallax. "

35:08.481 --> 35:12.400
We are aware of the threat.
We are assessing the situation.

35:13.653 --> 35:17.239
While you assess,
innocent lives will be lost.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.282
Let me take the fight to this enemy.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.953
There is much of which
you are not aware, Sinestro.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.872
If the danger is as great as we suspect...

35:26.040 --> 35:27.791
What are you saying?

35:28.626 --> 35:31.253
You believe this enemy can defeat us?

35:40.304 --> 35:44.641
Guardians, if your faith in our power
has faltered, let me renew it.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.436
Let me take a squadron of my strongest
Lanterns against this enemy...

35:48.604 --> 35:52.566
...and I'll prove to you
our best days are not behind us.

36:33.691 --> 36:34.733
Dr. Hammond?

36:35.901 --> 36:37.360
Dr. Hector Hammond?

36:38.362 --> 36:40.530
We need to ask you to come with us.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.493
Did Adam put you up to this?

37:01.135 --> 37:03.053
Get out of the car, please.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.417
Whoa.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.101
Dr. Hammond?

37:51.519 --> 37:52.686
Dr. Amanda Waller.

37:52.853 --> 37:57.565
I must apologize for the theatrics,
but the government does like its protocols.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.526
Please, follow me.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.675
Is that what I think it is?

38:23.843 --> 38:26.469
An alien life form, doctor.

38:26.762 --> 38:29.097
The first that mankind
has ever encountered...

38:29.265 --> 38:32.684
...despite what the conspiracy theorists
would have you believe.

38:32.852 --> 38:36.563
We want you to do the initial assessment
of its physiology.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.606
My God.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.944
Why me?

38:43.112 --> 38:46.573
As a xenobiologist, your skills are
specifically suited to the task.

38:46.741 --> 38:47.824
Beyond that...

38:47.992 --> 38:49.743
...I'm not at liberty to tell you.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.788
Hello.

39:25.070 --> 39:30.366
The eyes, nose, ears and mouth
are humanoid.

39:30.534 --> 39:34.829
In the left anterior thoracic region
is a 10-centimeter wound...

39:34.997 --> 39:38.625
...with jagged edges containing attached
cyanotic-colored coagulum.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.543
Okay, all right.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.379
Place the ring, then speak the oath.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.550
The oath.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.053
Because everybody knows the oath.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.889
Used to sing it in camp.

39:55.893 --> 39:59.562
I, Hal Jordan...

40:00.105 --> 40:02.357
...do solemnly swear...

40:02.525 --> 40:05.401
...to pledge allegiance...

40:05.903 --> 40:07.320
...to a lantern...

40:07.488 --> 40:11.324
...that I got from a dying purple alien...

40:11.909 --> 40:13.493
...in a swamp.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.578
The epidermis is magenta.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.623
It appears transparent
and is extremely thin...

40:18.791 --> 40:24.045
...allowing visualization of muscles
and individual muscle fibers.

40:25.005 --> 40:28.216
"To infinity and beyond. "

40:28.551 --> 40:31.094
"By the power of Grayskull. "

40:31.262 --> 40:32.762
What the hell?!

40:32.930 --> 40:36.599
If you can fly me 100 miles in the middle
of nowhere, you'd think that you...

40:37.268 --> 40:38.768
No!

40:50.406 --> 40:54.701
In brightest day, in blackest night...

40:55.035 --> 40:57.996
...no evil shall escape my sight.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.624
Let those who worship evil's might...

41:06.547 --> 41:08.631
...beware my power:

41:09.592 --> 41:10.800
Green Lantern's light.

41:30.487 --> 41:31.821
Carol.

41:32.406 --> 41:35.074
Everything okay in there?
- It's fine.

41:35.826 --> 41:36.910
Well, can I come in?

41:37.077 --> 41:38.161
No.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.914
Yeah, no, because we're...
Uh, do you wanna get a drink?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.124
Can we talk?
- Yeah.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.919
We can talk and drink.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.890
My initial analysis.
- Thank you, doctor.

41:59.058 --> 42:04.646
I don't need to tell you that the mere fact
that it's humanoid is extraordinary.

42:04.813 --> 42:09.817
It's indicating a convergent evolution,
or perhaps a common ancestry...

42:09.985 --> 42:13.363
...and the implications of that
are staggering.

42:13.530 --> 42:16.115
I mean, where did it come from?

42:16.283 --> 42:19.535
This could completely change the way
that the world views itself.

42:19.703 --> 42:22.789
You imagine the way that the public
will react to this?

42:23.540 --> 42:26.626
Um, but I know that
that won't happen. I do.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.796
Like yourself, doctor,
I'm a seeker of truth.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.507
But the people who pay for facilities
like this...

42:32.716 --> 42:35.385
...have other priorities
and the power to enforce them.

42:35.552 --> 42:37.387
So I keep it a secret.

42:37.554 --> 42:40.223
People like us have to work
within the system, doctor.

42:40.391 --> 42:43.017
We do the best we can.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.229
Right.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.775
Pick that up.

42:53.445 --> 42:55.071
I, um...

42:55.906 --> 42:57.156
I'm really sorry.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.951
Did you just apologize?

43:00.577 --> 43:03.830
You haven't been replaced by an alien
or something?

43:04.540 --> 43:05.665
No.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.333
I'm good.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.086
Ah. I'm good.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.089
I'm good, totally good. Uh...

43:16.427 --> 43:17.760
Do you think I'm irresponsible?

43:22.057 --> 43:25.059
No need to answer. That's fine.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.478
Hal. Ha, ha.

43:32.151 --> 43:33.901
You look pretty.

43:36.947 --> 43:40.616
And we haven't been in this place
together since...

43:41.618 --> 43:42.744
...that night.

43:43.787 --> 43:46.456
You forgot it was my birthday.
Did I?

43:46.623 --> 43:47.957
Mm.

43:48.125 --> 43:51.794
That was also the night...
The first time that we ever...

43:53.297 --> 43:54.922
...flew together.

43:57.634 --> 44:00.887
You've been flying ever since
with anyone who'd get in the plane.

44:06.435 --> 44:09.479
Oh, yeah.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.314
Oh, no.
Come on.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.982
No, yeah, let's go.
Mm-mm.

44:13.150 --> 44:15.651
Dance with me.
- No.

44:19.156 --> 44:24.243
No.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.329
Hal. No.

44:29.917 --> 44:30.958
No.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.341
I really am sorry.

44:38.509 --> 44:42.386
Oh. It's okay.
The contract isn't quite dead yet.

44:42.554 --> 44:43.971
I told you I was good at this.

44:44.139 --> 44:46.682
I wasn't talking about the contract.

44:49.978 --> 44:54.273
I would've screwed this up. You know?

44:55.109 --> 44:57.485
Even if I didn't go to the Air Force...

44:58.487 --> 45:00.822
...I would've found some way to...

45:01.824 --> 45:04.617
You and me, I would've blown it.
- Yeah, is that what you tell yourself?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.994
Mm. What do you tell yourself?

45:10.624 --> 45:13.334
That you were scared
I was getting too close.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.465
You know what I spent
my afternoon doing?

45:19.633 --> 45:21.092
What?

45:21.426 --> 45:23.427
Worrying about you.

45:25.055 --> 45:29.851
I went over every inch of the flight data.
There was nothing wrong with the plane.

45:30.686 --> 45:33.521
What happened up there?
Thanks for the dance.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.093
I told you to watch your back.

46:04.511 --> 46:07.555
You cost us all our jobs,
you son of a bitch.

46:26.950 --> 46:28.451
Pathetic.

46:28.911 --> 46:32.455
Bastard's been living off his old man's
reputation his whole life.

46:38.503 --> 46:39.962
Hey.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.381
Hey!

46:43.634 --> 46:45.551
My face is just getting warmed up.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.824
Whoa.

50:54.384 --> 50:56.802
Have you concluded admiring yourself?

50:56.970 --> 50:58.470
Uh...

50:58.638 --> 50:59.805
Yeah.

50:59.973 --> 51:03.767
Well, your ring translator
is functioning properly.

51:03.977 --> 51:07.146
Your mask will appear when protection
of your identity is required.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.023
There is no need for it on Oa.

51:09.441 --> 51:11.066
A talking fish.

51:11.234 --> 51:12.902
Actually, my race is Xudarian.

51:13.069 --> 51:16.572
Our DNA does somewhat resemble
your own ichthyological species.

51:17.407 --> 51:20.993
I am Tomar-Re, protector of Sector 2813
and home to...

51:21.161 --> 51:25.664
80,012 galaxies,
2.34 million sentient species.

51:26.541 --> 51:27.625
How do I know that?

51:27.792 --> 51:29.418
The induction process.

51:29.586 --> 51:34.048
It activates the ring's higher functions,
including a working knowledge base.

51:34.216 --> 51:35.424
In truth, we were curious.

51:35.592 --> 51:40.095
The process had never been attempted on
a species as young as humans before.

51:42.224 --> 51:47.269
As you are the first to be chosen,
I've been sent to welcome you here.

51:48.563 --> 51:50.981
And here is?

51:54.778 --> 51:57.029
Welcome to Oa.

52:01.409 --> 52:04.954
This planet has been our home
for countless millennia.

52:05.121 --> 52:08.123
It was created for us by the Guardians.

52:08.291 --> 52:09.959
Guardians?

52:10.126 --> 52:11.919
There stands their Citadel.

52:12.545 --> 52:15.714
They are immortals,
among the most ancient of races.

52:15.882 --> 52:20.135
They made all you see
and are responsible for all we are and do.

52:20.887 --> 52:23.305
Since time immemorial,
the Green Lantern Corps...

52:23.473 --> 52:28.310
...has served as the keepers of peace,
order and justice throughout the universe.

52:28.728 --> 52:32.564
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

52:32.732 --> 52:35.067
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

52:35.235 --> 52:37.736
Yeah. Yeah, that part I heard about.

52:38.446 --> 52:39.738
We're going to fly now.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.118
Fly?
- Absolutely.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.912
All right.

52:47.622 --> 52:49.665
I can do that.

52:54.671 --> 52:56.130
Join me.

52:57.799 --> 52:59.675
I can do that.

53:11.771 --> 53:13.439
Yeah!

53:14.107 --> 53:17.735
Whoa!

53:48.850 --> 53:50.267
What is that?

53:50.435 --> 53:53.354
It's the energy
that's generated from the Central Battery.

53:53.521 --> 53:57.024
Its power comes from the will
of every living creature in the universe.

53:57.442 --> 54:02.404
It, in turn, charges your lantern,
which, in turn, charges your ring.

54:02.572 --> 54:05.991
Even your suit is comprised
entirely of energy.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.743
What's with all the green?

54:07.911 --> 54:09.370
Green is the color of will.

54:09.537 --> 54:11.080
The Guardians harnessed will...

54:11.247 --> 54:14.541
...because it's the strongest
source of energy in the universe.

54:18.755 --> 54:20.422
There's so many.

54:20.590 --> 54:24.218
The stars you can see from
your home planet on the clearest night...

54:24.386 --> 54:26.428
...your sector is a thousand times larger.

54:27.806 --> 54:32.726
And 3600 Lanterns,
each with a sector just as vast.

54:56.709 --> 55:00.087
Lanterns, I've called you here
to this unprecedented gathering...

55:00.255 --> 55:03.549
...because we face
an unprecedented danger.

55:05.176 --> 55:09.555
Our four Lantern brothers
were killed by an enemy called Parallax.

55:10.723 --> 55:14.143
An enemy we don't yet fully understand.

55:14.602 --> 55:19.273
We do know it's powerful enough
to destroy entire civilizations.

55:20.650 --> 55:24.611
Powerful enough
to defeat even Abin Sur...

55:25.071 --> 55:27.197
...our finest warrior...

55:28.658 --> 55:30.784
...whose light can never be replaced.

55:36.166 --> 55:39.585
The Guardians have charged me
to lead a squadron of Lanterns...

55:39.752 --> 55:41.503
...in an assault on Parallax.

55:41.671 --> 55:45.382
We will seek out and find this enemy.

55:46.801 --> 55:49.011
And we will destroy it.

55:49.679 --> 55:53.515
Alone, we are now vulnerable.

55:53.766 --> 55:57.269
United, we are still invincible.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.855
We have never been defeated.

56:00.273 --> 56:02.149
Will we be defeated now?

56:02.317 --> 56:03.484
No!

56:04.444 --> 56:08.989
It was for this moment
that we were created.

56:09.157 --> 56:12.284
But I don't need to tell you your duty.

56:12.452 --> 56:15.454
I don't need to tell you who we are.

56:19.042 --> 56:22.878
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!

56:23.796 --> 56:28.175
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!

56:31.930 --> 56:35.390
Your will turns thought into reality.

56:35.892 --> 56:38.560
To master the ring,
you must learn to focus your will...

56:38.728 --> 56:41.772
...and create what you see in your mind.

56:45.068 --> 56:47.653
The ring's limits
are only what you can imagine.

56:52.992 --> 56:54.326
Do that again.

56:54.494 --> 56:55.744
Now you try.

56:57.997 --> 56:59.164
Concentrate.

57:15.557 --> 57:18.767
The ring will inform you
where there is an imminent threat.

57:22.188 --> 57:25.023
This particular threat's name is Kilowog.

57:25.191 --> 57:27.693
He'll be your combat training officer.

57:28.027 --> 57:31.613
Whoa!
- Never let your guard down, poozer.

57:32.448 --> 57:34.616
Welcome to Ring Slinging 101.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.368
Or as I like to call it:

57:36.536 --> 57:39.413
The worst day of your worthless life.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.918
The human. Ain't never seen one before.

57:47.505 --> 57:49.464
You smell funny.
- Ugh.

57:49.966 --> 57:51.008
I smell funny?

57:51.175 --> 57:54.970
Yeah, I heard about humans.
Think you're the center of the universe.

57:55.138 --> 57:56.179
You want to be a Lantern?

57:56.723 --> 57:58.765
You gotta commit to the Corps.

58:01.436 --> 58:03.895
All right, poozer.
Let's see what you've got.

58:17.160 --> 58:20.662
Your constructs are only gonna be
as strong as your will.

58:20.830 --> 58:22.331
And your will is pathetic.

58:27.170 --> 58:29.379
I'm gonna work you
and I'm gonna hit you...

58:29.547 --> 58:33.008
...until your will is strong enough
to be worthy of the Corps.

58:46.022 --> 58:47.356
Next lesson.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.527
Ha, ha. Feel that?

58:52.695 --> 58:55.322
It's the gravitational pull
of your average sun.

58:55.490 --> 58:58.950
Makes flying through space
very dangerous.

58:59.118 --> 59:02.287
The bigger you are,
the quicker you burn.

59:04.832 --> 59:06.875
Gravity's a bitch.

59:09.629 --> 59:11.838
Here, let me help you.

59:14.550 --> 59:19.388
Remember, your enemy,
he's not gonna play fair.

59:25.895 --> 59:28.855
Well, that's good advice.
Thanks, gorgeous.

59:29.023 --> 59:30.482
So...

59:32.026 --> 59:33.819
...this is the human.

59:34.570 --> 59:37.072
When I learned Abin Sur's ring
had chosen you...

59:37.240 --> 59:38.740
...I said there had to be a mistake.

59:41.411 --> 59:43.870
I see nothing to change my mind.

59:44.497 --> 59:46.206
I'll take it from here, Kilowog.

59:48.376 --> 59:50.585
The Corps is only as strong
as its weakest link.

59:51.254 --> 59:53.839
And I will tolerate no weak links.

59:54.340 --> 59:55.716
You understand me?

59:57.552 --> 01:00:00.220
Are you afraid, human?

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.182
Are you afraid?

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:05.392
Don't.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.229
Don't do that.

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:14.943
Shall we?

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.114
Sure.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.867
A sword?

01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:23.869
How human.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.506
I do believe I smell fear.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.638
I'm a Green Lantern.

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.726
I fear nothing.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.897
Fear is the enemy of will.

01:00:52.064 --> 01:00:53.899
Will is what makes you take action.

01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:01.072
Fear is what stops you
and makes you weak.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.914
Makes your constructs feeble.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:22.260
You must ignore your fear.
When you're afraid, you can't act.

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:25.972
When you can't act, you can't defend.
If you can't defend, you die.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.021
You reek of fear, Hal Jordan.

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:35.273
Abin Sur was a great warrior.

01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:37.526
My mentor.

01:01:37.818 --> 01:01:39.402
My friend.

01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:44.074
You insult his memory
by wearing his ring.

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:05.512
I'm done. He's right. I'm only human.
We're not ready to defend the universe.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.723
A few days ago, we thought we were
the only ones in the universe.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:12.561
The ring chose you. It wouldn't have
if it hadn't seen something in you.

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:13.770
Oh, yeah?

01:02:13.938 --> 01:02:16.147
Something you yourself don't yet see.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:18.233
The ring never makes a mistake.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.902
This time it did.

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:11.411
that until recently, we didn't realize...

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:16.458
...that many of these little critters that we've
been calling bacteria weren't bacteria at all.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:21.463
They were an entirely different type
of primitive prokaryotic cell.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:25.592
These little buggers, called archaeans,
are still poorly understood.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.512
Um...

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.724
But might turn out to be
different from bacteria...

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:40.273
But might turn out to be as different
from bacteria as bacteria is from us.

01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:41.650
Some call them extremophiles...

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:46.613
...because they live in the most extreme
environments on Earth, such as...

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:48.907
God, he's so boring.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.742
...the boiling waters of a geyser.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.327
What a loser.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.121
Michael!
- Huh?

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:57.123
What did you say?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.167
I didn't say anything.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:03.922
Did you just call me a loser?

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.174
What kind of freak is this guy?

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.967
"Freak"?!

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.196
Class dismissed.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.407
So how you been?

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:14.576
Been a while.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.913
So you had a rough night last night.
Did you get her name, huh?

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:24.461
You need to get some sleep, son.

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:28.006
Have a seat.
- What can I do for you, Dad?

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.592
Well, actually, you've already done it.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:32.927
For me and for your country.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:34.929
What are you talking about?

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:40.268
I'm talking about you impressing
a whole lot of very important people.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.230
Where did you get that?

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:47.942
I'm on a subcommittee
overseeing the agencies involved.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:53.114
Top-secret, of course.
- It was you. That's why they chose me.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:57.368
Because of this, we're gonna be able
to get you a top post on the inside now...

01:05:57.536 --> 01:05:59.204
...helping to oversee the operation.

01:05:59.371 --> 01:06:03.958
There are scientists
that worked their whole lives for this.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.127
Mm-hm.
- People more qualified.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.587
And less connected.

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:11.382
Don't be naive, son.
It's the way the world works.

01:06:11.675 --> 01:06:15.053
You have to seize an opportunity
when it presents itself.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.599
HAMMOND
He'll never get it.

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:20.809
Just wasting his life away.

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:23.645
What an embarrassment.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:28.817
Bill! Ha. How are you?

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:30.652
I'm terrific.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.739
No, no, no. Just finishing up a meeting.
Got plenty of time.

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:38.303
With my own eyes I saw this creature
induce fear in our finest warriors...

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:40.597
...and then feed on that fear.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.807
There's more.

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:46.978
We've tracked its trajectory.
Parallax is headed for Oa.

01:07:47.479 --> 01:07:49.814
Never before has an enemy
dared attack us here.

01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:52.233
You must tell me what you know.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.155
Will has always been our sole weapon...

01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:00.033
...against the forces of darkness
in the universe.

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:04.078
But as that power began to seem
insufficient...

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.748
...a great debate arose among us.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.334
Should we exploit
another source of power...

01:08:09.668 --> 01:08:13.671
...one we had long since sworn
should never be used?

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:15.757
Fear.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.594
But the power of fear
was too unpredictable.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.430
The chance of corruption too great.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:25.015
And so we decided against it.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:29.187
All of us, that is, except one.

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:33.649
Alone, this Guardian
entered the forbidden chamber.

01:08:33.817 --> 01:08:37.779
He wanted to prove the light of fear
could be mastered.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.782
His intentions were pure...

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:44.035
...but his hopes were naive.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.747
Consumed by the yellow power of fear...

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:52.460
...the Guardian became the very evil
he had wished to destroy.

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:54.712
He became Parallax.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:05.223
For the universe's safety and his own...

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:09.644
...Abin Sur was charged with
imprisoning Parallax in the Lost Sector.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.187
But he escaped.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:15.316
Feeding on the fear of others,
he grew larger, more powerful.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.651
And is now headed here...

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.154
...to take his revenge on you
and destroy the Corps.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.162
Then we have no choice.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:33.584
We must prepare to harness the power
of our enemy and fight fear with fear.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.921
To protect our sectors,
we must be able to defend ourselves.

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.883
We must forge a yellow ring.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:50.685
Watch your step.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.520
Senator.
Senator.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:55.606
Don't have to worry about me no more

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:58.985
I'm gone

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:03.781
I'm gone, I'm gone

01:10:06.326 --> 01:10:07.368
Hello.

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:08.786
Hi.

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:16.335
Everybody get on your feet

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.797
You make me nervous
When you're in your seat

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:22.050
Rough night, huh?

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.136
Hector.

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:28.056
How you doing?
What have you been up to?

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.850
Same old, same old.
- Yeah. Me too.

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:35.897
Hal Jordan. Worst pilot I've ever seen.
Or the best. Not quite sure.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.231
I've been called both.

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:40.902
Glad you could make it, son.
- I was a little surprised I got the invite.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.236
No, you're family, Hal.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.114
There are thinkers in this world
and there are doers.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:47.075
And you are one of the doers.

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:51.370
Yeah, but the thinkers
make what I do possible.

01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:53.915
Wouldn't have a plane
unless someone thought it up.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.458
Of course.

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:57.585
Excuse me, I need a drink.

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:02.090
I gotta get back to work. This is work.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:04.926
Nice to see you, son.
You too. You too.

01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:13.392
Nice.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:18.147
Yeah, my dad used to train in it.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.859
I was talking about your dress.

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.072
Nice jacket.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.407
Last time I checked,
you didn't even own one.

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:31.285
Yeah, I've been shaking up
the wardrobe lately.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:34.956
Congratulations on the contract.
How'd you manage to pull that off?

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.459
I pointed out you only won because you
broke the rules of engagement.

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.796
And Tom figured out
how to give the Sabres more altitude.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:45.258
So I guess in a way,
without even meaning to...

01:11:45.425 --> 01:11:47.135
...you actually did us a favor.

01:11:48.929 --> 01:11:50.304
Look...

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.516
...I'm uncomfortable
with the word "hero. "

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:55.309
Hey

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:04.485
Thank you. Thank you all for joining us.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:05.820
Great evening.

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:10.241
Somebody very special I'd like to thank
for helping us to nail this contract:

01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:13.327
My daughter, Carol Ferris.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.495
Come on!

01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:26.048
Congratulations, Carol.

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:28.301
I take one look at you, young lady...

01:12:28.468 --> 01:12:30.845
...or at Hal Jordan over there,
spitting image of his dad...

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.014
Whoo!
- You give us hope.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.183
A toast to our future.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.185
Hear, hear!
To the future!

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:38.436
We're in good hands.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.705
Hector! Oh, my God! Hey!

01:13:03.003 --> 01:13:05.546
Congratulations. Um...
Thank you.

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:09.300
Here's to you and Hal, the future.

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:13.346
Yeah, heh, I'm sorry.

01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:17.475
I know it couldn't have been easy
growing up with your dad.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:20.645
But, hey, you're doing great, so... Ha, ha.

01:13:20.812 --> 01:13:22.563
I am. I'm doing great. Ha, ha.

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:25.399
He's right, though. I'm not a doer.
Ha, ha.

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:28.236
Although I did get to examine
an alien body recently.

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:29.946
That was very cool.

01:13:30.113 --> 01:13:33.699
I can't tell anyone about it,
but, hey, you can't have everything.

01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:36.118
Hector telling you another
of his science-fiction stories?

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:38.287
What the hell's wrong with him?

01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:40.248
Can't keep his mouth shut.

01:13:40.832 --> 01:13:43.251
You really do have
a creative imagination.

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:44.752
Bye.

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:46.087
Senator.

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:49.257
I apologize. We really must go.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.343
Good night, Carol.
- Good night.

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:56.931
Senator!

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.808
Hey.

01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:00.768
Thanks for everything.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.072
Bye, senator!

01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:42.310
Get the crash crew here.
Our helicopter's going down.

01:14:52.612 --> 01:14:53.738
Oh, my God.

01:16:01.848 --> 01:16:04.308
What is that? What is that?

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:30.811
What happened tonight took place
in just a matter of seconds...

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:33.647
...but people will be talking about it
for years to come.

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:37.735
A helicopter careening out of control,
headed toward certain tragedy...

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:42.072
...when all of a sudden, a mystery man,
a hero, saves the day...

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.826
...incredibly diverting the helicopter
from destroying innocent people...

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:50.331
...and miraculously rescuing Carol Ferris.

01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:56.003
The real question tonight is who is this
amazing hero and where is he now?

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:08.390
Start talking.

01:18:09.559 --> 01:18:11.018
A racetrack?
- Yeah.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.603
Hmm.

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:16.190
That's the best you could come up with
for your first big appearance? Racetrack.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.526
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I disappoint you?

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:23.322
I materialized a track out of pure energy,
saving hundreds, and you're disappointed.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:24.615
I'm sorry about that.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.492
No, I wanna see this stuff. Show me.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.202
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.912
Come on, I wanna see this stuff.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.706
I wanna see the outfit, the flying...
You gotta show me.

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:34.750
Hal, being your best friend's no picnic.

01:18:34.918 --> 01:18:37.169
It's for emergencies!
- You owe me!

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:40.631
Hal, I wanna see it.

01:18:41.841 --> 01:18:42.883
Fine.

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:45.678
Hold on to your glasses.

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:49.640
All right.

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:51.308
Question:

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.145
You ready to have your mind blown?
- Yeah.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.273
Ring.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.024
Finger.

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:10.703
Here we go.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:21.463
Did you break it already?
- I didn't break it, okay? It's just...

01:19:21.631 --> 01:19:24.383
It's out of juice. I have to recharge it.

01:19:34.644 --> 01:19:36.478
Now pay attention.

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.442
Aah! Green!

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:46.614
Wow.
- I know, right?!

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.951
Whoo!

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.247
Not bad, huh?

01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:57.583
You're a superhero.

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:07.801
Don't they always get the girl?

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:38.415
Evening, ma'am.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:41.710
Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.046
Are you okay?

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:47.675
Uh, yeah, no,
I'm glad to have a chance to thank you.

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:50.594
Just doing my job.
No thanks necessary, miss.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:52.846
No, it is.

01:20:53.598 --> 01:20:55.474
You saved my life.

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:59.019
You saved all of our lives.
That was a very...

01:21:06.277 --> 01:21:07.444
Hal?

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:09.029
Miss?

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.614
Hal?!

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:14.034
Oh, my Go... Oh, my God!

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:16.870
Oh, my God! Hal!
- How did you know it was me?

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:19.790
What? I've known you my whole life!
I've seen you naked!

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:22.876
You don't think I would recognize you
because I can't see your cheekbones?!

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:26.797
What is this?! Why is your skin green?
Why are you glowing?

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:28.674
What the hell is with that mask?!

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:30.384
It came with the outfit.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.012
Cool, huh?

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:38.559
So it all works
because of this magic ring? Ha, ha.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:41.395
No, there's no such thing as magic.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.189
Intergalactic green peacekeepers,
thousands of them.

01:21:44.357 --> 01:21:46.650
Ha, ha.
- But, no.

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.026
I'm not making it up.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:53.031
I mean, when we were kids,
who'd have thought?

01:21:53.658 --> 01:21:57.161
I did, actually. I called this early on.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:21:57.328 --> 01:22:01.373
I said, "One day I'll be a green space cop. "
Here I am.

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:06.587
Okay, so at the party, how did you
make that big green ramp thing?

01:22:07.338 --> 01:22:10.674
Anything I see in my mind, I can create.
I just have to focus.

01:22:11.342 --> 01:22:12.426
Anything?

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.678
Anything.

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:33.030
Happy birthday. Better late than never.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.282
Um...

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:37.951
Okay, so how does it work?

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:43.415
They just, um, call you on your cell,
"Cat in a tree, downtown Milky Way"?

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:46.627
No. I don't think it works
exactly like that.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.379
Well, technically speaking, um...

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.799
...I actually sort of, uh...

01:22:52.842 --> 01:22:54.092
...quit.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.469
What do you mean? How?

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:59.139
Well, I mean, it's a lot like quitting
anything else, really.

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:00.974
I don't understand.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.435
How do you walk away
from something like that?

01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:04.812
Is that even possible?

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:08.440
Oh, I think we both know
I'm pretty good at walking away.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.824
If for once you didn't quit something
you cared about...

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:19.243
...what's the worst that could happen?

01:23:36.636 --> 01:23:38.846
Well, thank you.
This has been really something.

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:42.391
I know I've made a lot of mistakes...
- Look, Hal, I'm not mad at you.

01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:45.519
I feel bad for you, really.

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.689
You've been given so much so often.

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:51.024
And you just...

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.238
Good night.

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:50.500
Dr. Hammond?

01:24:52.837 --> 01:24:55.714
There is something I'd like to show you.

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:59.301
Something I'm fairly certain
you'll want to see.

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:08.894
See you later, Mom.

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.729
I love you.
Bye, baby.

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:14.358
No!

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:21.782
Physical contact
accesses mnemonic data.

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:25.202
I can see your memories.

01:26:01.614 --> 01:26:02.656
Dad.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.660
Son, this is my fault.

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.246
But I'm gonna fix it.

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:13.625
We're gonna get you well again.
Whatever it takes.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.171
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.757
We detected traces
of a second alien life form...

01:26:20.925 --> 01:26:23.009
...buried within the body of the first.

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:25.512
You've been exposed.

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:30.809
I've never felt better in my life.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.937
We know everything, son.

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:37.023
I've never felt better in my life.

01:26:57.378 --> 01:27:01.131
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:03.842
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

01:27:04.051 --> 01:27:06.553
The ring never makes a mistake.

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.246
It's gonna be all right.

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:35.832
They just need to run some tests,
that's all.

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:42.672
Keep him under.

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:48.053
I only want what's best for you.

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.031
Run.

01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:44.943
Hector.
Shh, shh.

01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:46.653
Don't worry.

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:50.490
I only want what's best for you.

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:15.158
The ring, it chose you.

01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:16.868
Take it!

01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:19.996
Hal.

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:22.666
Hi.

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:28.421
The alien was one of you.

01:30:30.383 --> 01:30:32.926
How did we end up so different?

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:34.844
Hmm? Hmm?

01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:36.638
Sit down!

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.183
Now...

01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:43.603
...how's Carol?

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:47.232
That came out wrong.
- Please.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.275
I've made mistakes...
- Look, Hal...

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:51.903
I feel bad for you, really. Good night.

01:30:57.743 --> 01:31:01.997
You're just as much of a failure
as I was.

01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:04.958
And just as afraid.

01:31:06.168 --> 01:31:08.586
Well...

01:31:09.296 --> 01:31:11.548
...I used to fight my fear.

01:31:15.302 --> 01:31:19.472
But now that I've tasted its true power...

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:25.145
...I'll never go back.

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:35.613
No!

01:31:55.301 --> 01:31:58.928
You wear the ring of the Lantern
that imprisoned me.

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.307
You will suffer the same fate.

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:05.810
Once I have devoured your world...

01:32:05.978 --> 01:32:08.313
...I will have all the strength I need...

01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:12.358
...to defeat the Corps
and destroy the Guardians.

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:46.059
Let me get this straight.

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:49.604
This thing that's out there attacking
planets is connected to Hector?

01:32:49.772 --> 01:32:52.357
Somehow it infected him
after it killed Abin Sur.

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:56.736
Well, you're just gonna have to stop it.
- Oh, I'm just gonna have to stop it, huh?

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.571
Well, I tried that and I failed.

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:02.075
And the senator died.
I told you, the ring made a mistake.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:04.911
Wait, go back.
How did the ring make a mistake?

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:10.041
The one thing that a Green Lantern
is supposed to be is fearless.

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:13.711
Fearless is the job description.

01:33:14.338 --> 01:33:15.380
That isn't me.

01:33:15.548 --> 01:33:17.924
So you're just gonna walk away again?

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:22.011
Explain this to me, Hal.
Please explain to me just once, why.

01:33:22.179 --> 01:33:23.930
Because I'm afraid!

01:33:40.739 --> 01:33:42.782
You don't think your dad ever felt afraid?

01:33:44.076 --> 01:33:45.910
If he did,
he figured out some way to beat it.

01:33:46.078 --> 01:33:48.788
Yeah, well, there's a word for that:

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.665
Courage.

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:01.301
They said that the ring wouldn't have
chosen me if it didn't see something.

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:05.597
Something I don't see. Yet.

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:10.685
I see it.

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:13.980
I always have.

01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:17.317
The ring didn't see
that you were fearless.

01:34:17.484 --> 01:34:20.820
It saw that you had the ability
to overcome fear.

01:34:21.572 --> 01:34:23.990
It saw that you're courageous.

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.494
Which you are.

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.663
Just like your dad.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:42.050
The Lantern is a threat.

01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:45.220
Eliminate him.

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:21.339
Our new weapon is ready.

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.716
Once I've mastered its power...

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:27.053
...I'll begin training the Corps
to do the same.

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.556
Though Earth will be lost...

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:35.061
...we'll be ready to make a stand against
Parallax before it reaches Oa.

01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:36.813
Then the power of the enemy
will be ours.

01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:38.815
At what cost?

01:35:41.568 --> 01:35:44.237
You dare enter this chamber?
- I need your help.

01:35:45.864 --> 01:35:48.074
You gotta help me save my world.

01:35:55.916 --> 01:36:01.087
I know that humans aren't
the strongest species, or the smartest.

01:36:02.506 --> 01:36:04.590
We're young, we have a lot to learn.

01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:06.592
But we're worth saving.

01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:17.603
This new weapon of yours,
you can't use it.

01:36:17.813 --> 01:36:21.607
Once you cross that line, once you've given
in to fear, you'll never go back. I've seen it.

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:26.571
Look, I know right now you're afraid.

01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:29.073
You dare accuse the Guardians
of feeling fear?

01:36:29.241 --> 01:36:30.533
Yes, I do.

01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:32.869
That's exactly why Parallax
is beating you...

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:35.621
...because you're afraid
to even admit you're afraid.

01:36:35.789 --> 01:36:37.373
I know.

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:39.751
I spent my entire life doing it.

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.546
You know, we have a saying on Earth.

01:36:43.714 --> 01:36:46.257
We say, "I'm only human. "

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:51.596
We say it because we're vulnerable,
we say it because we know we're afraid.

01:36:51.764 --> 01:36:53.890
It doesn't mean we're weak.

01:36:56.143 --> 01:36:57.602
Help me save my planet.

01:36:58.645 --> 01:37:00.063
Don't give in to fear.

01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:03.357
Fight it. Fight it with me.

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:06.986
Your words are compelling, young human.

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:10.823
But as immortals, we must measure
our actions over billions of years...

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:13.159
...and the fate of the universe.

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:17.830
We simply cannot risk losing everything
on the chance you might be right.

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:21.125
Then don't. Don't risk any more lives.

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:23.461
Just mine.

01:37:25.255 --> 01:37:27.006
Let me go fight for my world...

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:31.385
...and I'll show you
that will is stronger than fear.

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:34.514
There is no way you can succeed.

01:37:34.681 --> 01:37:36.891
You will die, Hal Jordan.

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.770
Then I'll die trying.

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:45.525
Good luck, Green Lantern.

01:38:44.877 --> 01:38:46.419
I wouldn't do that.

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:50.756
Look closely.

01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:57.513
She's beautiful, isn't she?

01:38:58.765 --> 01:39:01.601
I loved her from the moment
I first saw her.

01:39:01.768 --> 01:39:04.937
But she could never see me,
as you were always standing in the way.

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:06.939
But not anymore.

01:39:07.566 --> 01:39:10.067
No! No! Don't! Don't do this, Hector.

01:39:10.235 --> 01:39:13.779
Please.

01:39:14.865 --> 01:39:15.907
I know how you feel.

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:19.952
Come on, look at yourself!

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.790
No, I know what it's like...

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.960
...to not live up to expectations...

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.380
...to feel like nothing that you do
will ever be good enough.

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:37.970
I know what it's like to be afraid.

01:39:39.097 --> 01:39:40.890
Let me help you.

01:39:42.267 --> 01:39:45.144
Hal. You've changed.

01:39:46.396 --> 01:39:49.899
How wonderful that all it took for you
to grow up was the end of the world.

01:39:51.401 --> 01:39:53.110
Now it's my turn.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:58.449
And if I can't be like you,
I'm gonna make her like me.

01:39:58.617 --> 01:40:00.785
And let's face it, once she's like me...

01:40:01.578 --> 01:40:03.746
...then you wouldn't be very interested.

01:40:03.914 --> 01:40:05.998
Hmm? Now, would you?

01:40:07.834 --> 01:40:09.961
Why can't you?
- Hmm?

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:13.130
Why can't you be like me?

01:40:13.298 --> 01:40:15.341
Heh. Huh?

01:40:16.593 --> 01:40:17.969
Let her go...

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:22.473
...and you can have it.

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:30.022
You can do anything.

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.358
Be anything.

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:36.445
Take it.

01:40:39.741 --> 01:40:41.993
Let her make the choice.

01:40:47.499 --> 01:40:48.958
Okay.

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:17.903
Wow.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:29.915
Now bring her down.

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:34.754
Hal.

01:41:36.548 --> 01:41:37.590
I lied.

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.222
I lied too.

01:41:45.932 --> 01:41:47.933
See, the way it works is...

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:49.352
...you have to be chosen.

01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:32.061
You have failed me.

01:43:03.593 --> 01:43:04.844
Stay here.

01:43:05.011 --> 01:43:06.345
No problem.

01:43:33.957 --> 01:43:36.959
Your will is strong,
but not strong enough.

01:43:38.044 --> 01:43:40.880
You are nothing without the ring.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:09.241
POLICEMAN
You must move out of the area now.

01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:11.911
Please clear the streets.

01:44:12.078 --> 01:44:13.871
Clear the streets immediately.

01:44:17.334 --> 01:44:19.585
You can never beat this. You'll die.

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:21.587
At least I can get it away from here.

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:24.423
How do you think you're gonna do that?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:44:25.842 --> 01:44:28.260
Maybe I can outthink it or...

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:30.262
The dogfight, remember?

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.931
Those were a couple of jets.

01:44:32.098 --> 01:44:34.225
Unbeatable jets.

01:44:36.519 --> 01:44:39.104
The ring chose me for a reason.

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:42.149
This is why.

01:44:43.735 --> 01:44:46.612
Look, I'm probably not...
- Please don't. No.

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.155
Hey.

01:44:57.207 --> 01:44:59.458
POLICEMAN
This is a mandatory evacuation.

01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:01.961
Everyone must clear the streets
immediately.

01:45:03.546 --> 01:45:07.633
Police emergency,
everyone must clear the street now.

01:45:42.919 --> 01:45:45.337
Everybody off now! Now!

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.131
Go! Go!

01:45:56.474 --> 01:45:57.808
Run!

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:25.961
Run!
- Aah! Aah!

01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:47.399
I feel your fear growing.

01:46:47.817 --> 01:46:49.610
You will be dead soon.

01:46:49.778 --> 01:46:52.571
In brightest day, in blackest night...

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:56.241
And when you're gone,
I'll destroy everything you ever loved.

01:46:56.409 --> 01:46:59.411
no evil shall escape my sight.

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:03.040
Your family, your home,
your planet will be no more.

01:47:03.458 --> 01:47:07.336
Let those who worship evil's might...

01:47:07.504 --> 01:47:12.132
The entire human race will be wiped out
because you, Hal Jordan...

01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.842
...were afraid.

01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:16.553
beware my power:

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.430
Green Lantern's light!

01:48:34.424 --> 01:48:38.343
The bigger you are, the faster you burn.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:42.426
Though his time
wearing the ring has been brief...

01:50:43.511 --> 01:50:48.807
...Hal Jordan's defeat of Parallax will be
remembered as long as the Corps exists.

01:50:49.017 --> 01:50:52.644
His actions are a reminder
of why the ring chose each of us.

01:50:53.813 --> 01:50:55.647
To overcome fear...

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:59.651
...and destroy evil wherever it may hide.

01:51:08.202 --> 01:51:10.454
As Lanterns,
we must fight with all our will.

01:51:12.206 --> 01:51:14.666
Our wills haven't always been united.

01:51:16.502 --> 01:51:17.753
It's time they were.

01:51:19.797 --> 01:51:22.424
Ha-ha-ha.
- Can I train them or can I train them?

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:26.053
You're impertinent, Hal Jordan.

01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:29.848
You're rash, volatile, opinionated.

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:34.603
It seems Abin Sur found another
just like himself.

01:52:16.562 --> 01:52:19.481
Wow, I am never getting used to that.

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:27.572
My new job requires that I travel.

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:31.827
Be away for a while.

01:52:35.665 --> 01:52:39.418
Away, never gone.

01:52:44.173 --> 01:52:45.382
Hal.

01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:46.883
Yeah?

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.428
Can you take off the mask?

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.934
That's really cool. Ha, ha.

01:53:10.616 --> 01:53:12.451
So, what happens now?

01:53:13.703 --> 01:53:15.620
I'm gonna go look for trouble.

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:41.563
Of all the Lanterns
who have ever worn the ring...

01:53:41.731 --> 01:53:44.733
...there was one
whose light shined brightest.

01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:48.487
At first, his humanity
was thought to be a weakness.

01:53:48.654 --> 01:53:52.574
And yet it proved to be
his greatest strength.
