37:52.004 --> 37:53.970
HOW'S DETECTIVE PATTERSON?

37:53.972 --> 37:54.904
STABLE,
PULLING THROUGH.

37:54.906 --> 37:55.972
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.791
BIG NIGHT.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.609
SPIKE:
WHAT I HEAR, PEDAL-TO-THE-METAL
WAS PRACTICALLY FLAWLESS.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.679
31 ARRESTS,
114 CHARGES LAID.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.714
WINNIE:

HOW'S HE DOING?

38:04.716 --> 38:05.982
SAM:
NOT SO GOOD.

38:08.453 --> 38:09.919
YOU GUYS GOT A SEC?

38:12.591 --> 38:13.890
LOCKER ROOM?

38:13.892 --> 38:14.958

38:30.075 --> 38:32.709
SO, UM...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

38:33.645 --> 38:36.446
WHAT TONIGHT WAS ABOUT

38:38.517 --> 38:39.716
I HAVE PARKINSON'S.

(SIGHS, RELIEVED)
SO, UH, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:55.567 --> 38:57.667
<i> IT MEANS THAT SOONER OR LATER,</i>

38:57.669 --> 38:59.903
SHORT OF MAJOR MEDICAL
BREAKTHROUGHS

38:59.905 --> 39:03.506
IN THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE -
WHICH COULD HAPPEN -

39:03.508 --> 39:07.644
UH... MY NERVOUS SYSTEM'S

39:16.054 --> 39:18.521
I WAS SCARED, YOU KNOW?

39:19.758 --> 39:22.559
SAYING IT MAKES IT REAL
AND...

39:22.561 --> 39:24.427
I WANTED TO BE,
YOU KNOW...

39:24.429 --> 39:26.062
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

39:26.064 --> 39:27.697
PERFECT FOR YOU GUYS,

39:27.699 --> 39:30.400

39:30.402 --> 39:33.136
GREG:
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
WORDY'S MEDICATIONS

39:33.138 --> 39:36.906
KEEP HIS SYMPTOMS
FULLY UNDER CONTROL.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.408
<i> COULD BE THAT WAY FOR YEARS.</i>

39:38.410 --> 39:39.943

39:39.945 --> 39:43.046
UH, BOSS...
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

39:43.048 --> 39:44.781
I'M A TIME BOMB.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.151
A MONTH, A YEAR, TWO YEARS,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

39:51.022 --> 39:53.790
I'M NOT PERFECT
AND YOU GUYS NEED ME TO BE.

39:54.793 --> 39:58.595
'CAUSE ONE DAY MY HANDS
ARE GONNA CATCH A TREMOR

39:58.597 --> 40:01.030
AND YOUR LIVES ARE IN 'EM.

40:01.967 --> 40:04.534
IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.971
BUT, WORDY,
WHICH ONE OF US IS PERFECT?

40:08.974 --> 40:11.441
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE JUST PEOPLE.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.745
I'M NOT PERFECT.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.914
I'M DEFINITELY NOT PERFECT,

40:31.062 --> 40:33.029
THAN ANY OTHER SIX PEOPLE
YOU CAN FIND ON THE FORCE.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.533
EDDIE, I'D GO THROUGH
ANY DOOR WITH YOU.

40:38.970 --> 40:42.105
BUT NONE OF US
CAN DO THIS JOB FOREVER.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.074
<i> ANYWAY,</i>
<i> UH, I'VE BEEN THINKING -</i>

40:45.076 --> 40:47.510

UH, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT OTHER DEPARTMENTS,

40:50.682 --> 40:53.149
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE GUNS AND GANGS.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.187
THOUGH TEAM ONE'S GONNA BE
A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.758
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT
IN HERE EVERYDAY

41:01.760 --> 41:03.226
WITHOUT YOU, WORDY?

41:03.228 --> 41:05.728
THIS FROM THE GUY
WHO BROKE INTO MY LOCKER?

41:08.233 --> 41:11.100
WE ALWAYS FIND A WAY
THROUGH, EDDIE;

41:11.102 --> 41:13.102
THAT'S THE JOB.

41:13.104 --> 41:16.039
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO DO YOURS TWICE AS GOOD.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.852
(EXHALES, HOLDING BACK TEARS)

41:37.128 --> 41:40.530
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING RIGHT
BY THE TEAM.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.035
LOOK, I SHOULDN' HAVE
REACTED LIKE THAT.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.938
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KEPT THINGS
FROM MY TEAM LEADER.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.579
LOOK, ME AND YOU,

41:55.580 --> 41:56.980
WE JUST HAVE TO BE
ON THE SAME PAGE HERE.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.147
NO SECRETS.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.617

NO SECRETS.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.121
WE'RE SHORT A MAN.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.825
YEAH.
YOU OKAY?

42:11.563 --> 42:13.029
20 YEARS.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.163
