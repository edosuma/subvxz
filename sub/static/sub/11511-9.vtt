00:00.233 --> 00:01.834
<i>Previously on</i> Game of Silence...

00:01.867 --> 00:04.536
I say we take 'em all down...
the warden, Terry,

00:04.569 --> 00:06.605
his whole crew, and we got
to link him to a crime that

00:06.638 --> 00:08.135
- doesn't have a clock on it.
- Like what?

00:08.160 --> 00:08.840
Like murder.

00:08.873 --> 00:11.409
- SHAWN: <i>What about Petey?</i>
- We got to get his boy to a hospital!

00:11.443 --> 00:13.346
GIL: <i>Something happened to that kid.
He vanished.</i>

00:13.379 --> 00:14.747
RAY: Sweet Amy Reese.

00:16.715 --> 00:19.018
- Hey, Uncle D, have you seen my...?
- Leesha.

00:20.852 --> 00:22.555
Is that what I think it is?

00:22.588 --> 00:24.789
This wasn't our deal.
I can't watch you kill.

00:24.823 --> 00:27.059
As long as you want your
brother protected in prison,

00:27.091 --> 00:28.860
you will do whatever I ask.

00:28.893 --> 00:30.128
Ray Carroll's got a safe,

00:30.161 --> 00:31.731
<i>and I think he's got pictures in it.</i>

00:31.764 --> 00:33.132
<i>Carroll's blackmail stuff's in there.</i>

00:33.164 --> 00:35.935
What are you doing here?
I've seen you with Ray Carroll.

00:35.967 --> 00:37.001
Jackson, what's gotten into you?

00:37.034 --> 00:38.002
This woman is a liar.

00:38.036 --> 00:39.805
MARINA: Jackson, enough!

00:39.838 --> 00:40.872
What's your angle?

00:40.905 --> 00:42.540
- What'd you do, Gil?
- Shot Bobby.

00:42.573 --> 00:43.442
JACKSON: <i>Are you insane?</i>

00:43.475 --> 00:45.544
<i>Cops find out, we all go to prison.</i>

00:45.576 --> 00:47.347
GIL: <i>No one's gonna find out, Jackie!</i>

00:49.814 --> 00:51.352
It's unbelievable.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.619
Mayors, judges, politicians, CEOs.

00:54.652 --> 00:57.249
No wonder Carroll's untouchable.
Is this...?

00:57.282 --> 00:58.607
This is everything?

00:59.591 --> 01:01.494
Yeah, that's it.

01:03.715 --> 01:04.997
So what are we supposed
to do with all this?

01:05.029 --> 01:06.998
Well, for now, we sit on it.

01:07.644 --> 01:09.033
- What?
- Yeah.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.302
Al this stuff is stolen, Shawn.

01:10.335 --> 01:13.139
- We can't use it as evidence in court.
- Screw the courts.

01:13.172 --> 01:15.183
Why can't we just leak it
to the press or something?

01:15.208 --> 01:18.042
- Show people what the man's been up to.
- The warden was smart.

01:18.076 --> 01:19.577
He's not in any of these pictures,

01:19.610 --> 01:21.479
and we can't even prove
that he took 'em.

01:21.512 --> 01:22.914
Now, we leak it, it just gives him

01:22.948 --> 01:23.639
a chance to cover his tracks.

01:23.664 --> 01:26.184
We need to... think about this.
We need some time.

01:26.217 --> 01:27.686
We ain't got time, Jackie.

01:27.719 --> 01:29.922
Nurse Amy said she
found something, then,

01:29.955 --> 01:31.056
an hour later, she winds up dead.

01:31.089 --> 01:33.625
And it wasn't from no damn
suicide, and you know it!

01:33.658 --> 01:35.179
- I know, Shawn. I know.
- Then do something about it!

01:35.204 --> 01:37.013
I don't have the answers, Sean!

01:37.529 --> 01:39.030
Look, this is complicated.

01:39.064 --> 01:42.551
Between Terry, the warden,
what you did to Bobby Marks.

01:42.576 --> 01:43.312
What? No, no, no, no.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.803
- Don't go putting that on us, man.
- Well, I didn't ask you

01:44.836 --> 01:46.005
to go down there and kill him, did I?

01:46.038 --> 01:47.539
- It wasn't part of the plan, was it?
- Yeah, no, no, no, no.

01:47.573 --> 01:49.708
This ain't about Bobby, all right?

01:49.740 --> 01:51.543
You know what? I'm sick of your plan!

01:51.577 --> 01:53.546
I'm sick of all of it.

01:54.746 --> 01:57.716
(footsteps running)

01:57.749 --> 02:00.853
- (sighs)
- (door closes)

02:00.886 --> 02:02.854
Oh. He's just upset
about Nurse Amy, man.

02:02.887 --> 02:04.978
Yeah, of course, he is.

02:07.975 --> 02:08.860
RAY: <i>I don't know</i>

02:08.893 --> 02:10.318
quite what to say, Detective.

02:10.761 --> 02:12.865
Bobby Marks was like a son to me.

02:12.897 --> 02:14.980
The last phone call he made was to you.

02:15.450 --> 02:16.941
What did you two talk about?

02:17.958 --> 02:19.215
It was always the same...

02:19.637 --> 02:21.350
football, fishing.

02:23.679 --> 02:26.779
You have any idea who
might be responsible?

02:26.812 --> 02:28.373
No, we're still investigating.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.815
I was wondering
if <i>you</i> might have any ideas.

02:30.849 --> 02:33.229
I don't know why
anyone would want to hurt Bobby.

02:33.918 --> 02:36.348
He was about as agreeable
as one could be.

02:36.380 --> 02:37.522
Mr. Carroll,

02:37.556 --> 02:40.058
this is the second time
a guard who worked for you

02:40.092 --> 02:42.061
at Quitman has turned up either missing

02:42.093 --> 02:43.295
or dead.

02:43.327 --> 02:45.063
Do you think Red Tyson's disappearance

02:45.097 --> 02:46.699
and Bobby's murder
could somehow be related?

02:46.731 --> 02:47.844
Detective, I'm...

02:48.652 --> 02:51.936
truly sad to hear about Bobby,
but I resent the implication

02:51.969 --> 02:54.907
that my tenure at Quitman could
have something to do with this.

02:54.939 --> 02:57.109
I might also remind you
that I'm running for congress.

02:57.141 --> 02:58.242
The last thing

02:58.277 --> 03:01.266
I need is to be associated
with a murder investigation.

03:01.299 --> 03:03.648
So unless you want me
to call your superior

03:03.682 --> 03:06.218
and ask why I'm being roped in

03:06.250 --> 03:08.720
to some kind
of reckless fishing expedition,

03:08.754 --> 03:10.790
I suggest we wrap this up.

03:12.544 --> 03:13.993
Are we done?

03:17.848 --> 03:19.164
Yes, sir.

03:20.766 --> 03:22.134
(door opens)

03:22.166 --> 03:23.332
(door closes)

03:24.035 --> 03:26.237
(touch tones sounding)

03:27.546 --> 03:28.941

03:28.974 --> 03:31.277
MAN (shouting):
Go ahead! It's loading now!

03:31.309 --> 03:33.711
I think about two.

03:33.744 --> 03:35.748
Be careful with the bags.

03:44.238 --> 03:46.659
Not a bad way to start the day, huh, T?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.964
Not a bad way at all.

03:58.028 --> 03:59.305
(sighs)

04:02.906 --> 04:04.210
(sighs)

04:13.885 --> 04:14.987
(blow landing, Young Gil yells)

04:15.020 --> 04:16.221
RED: <i>Come on, boy.</i>

04:16.253 --> 04:17.623
YOUNG GIL: <i>Let me go!</i>

04:17.656 --> 04:19.791
RED: <i>You better stop fighting me.</i>

04:19.825 --> 04:22.127
RAY: <i>I think he needs
to learn how to cooperate!</i>

04:22.159 --> 04:24.262
(Young Gil sighs, groans)

04:26.164 --> 04:27.767
DARRYL: <i>The warden likes you.</i>

04:29.767 --> 04:32.705
<i>Play your cards right, you're
gonna get anything you want.</i>

04:32.738 --> 04:35.708
- <i>(laughter)</i>
- RAY: <i>I hope we have an understanding.</i>

04:35.741 --> 04:37.497
- <i>Yeah, boy.</i>
- <i>No!</i>

04:38.142 --> 04:40.246
YOUNG GIL: <i>Let me go!</i>

04:41.813 --> 04:44.015
(car brakes squeak, engine revs)

04:50.287 --> 04:51.757
(dog barking in distance)

04:56.699 --> 04:57.838
GIL: <i>What the hell is this?!</i>

04:57.871 --> 04:59.806
You guys got to quit
harassing me about Darryl, man.

04:59.839 --> 05:00.905
We're not here about him.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.887
We'd like to talk to you about

05:02.912 --> 05:04.558
Bobby Marks if you've got a minute.

05:04.619 --> 05:06.587
- Who?
- OSCAR: Bobby Marks.

05:06.621 --> 05:08.245
He was a guard at Quitman
when you were there.

05:09.435 --> 05:10.892
Bobby, yeah, yeah, all right.

05:10.924 --> 05:12.233
What about him?

05:12.508 --> 05:13.808
He's dead, Mr. Harris.

05:15.527 --> 05:17.032
We pulled his body
out of the lake yesterday.

05:17.065 --> 05:18.899
We think he might have been murdered.

05:19.234 --> 05:20.165
(scoffs)

05:20.199 --> 05:23.337
Look, Bobby wasn't my
favorite person, but...

05:23.753 --> 05:24.854
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:25.205 --> 05:27.575
Had you and Mr. Marks
been in touch recently?

05:27.609 --> 05:28.710
- Me and Bobby? No.
- So you didn't

05:28.744 --> 05:30.660
drop by to visit him in
the last few weeks or anything?

05:30.694 --> 05:32.029
No. Why would I?

05:32.888 --> 05:34.181
What?

05:34.215 --> 05:35.916
I didn't kill the guy,
if that's what you're thinking.

05:35.941 --> 05:37.118
Okay.

05:37.150 --> 05:39.153
Would you like
to give us a written statement

05:39.186 --> 05:40.855
to that effect down at the station?

05:40.888 --> 05:43.837
It's just the fastest way
for us to clear you as a lead.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.713
Yeah, sure, I can do that.

05:47.745 --> 05:48.963
OSCAR: Great.

05:48.996 --> 05:51.498
Can you turn around?
Put your hands behind your back.

05:51.532 --> 05:53.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this?

05:53.034 --> 05:54.135
What am I, under arrest?

05:54.167 --> 05:55.336
Well, it's department policy.

05:55.369 --> 05:56.937
We can't transport civilians

05:56.970 --> 05:58.172
without restraints.

05:59.207 --> 06:01.276
There's a lot of crazy
people in this world.

06:01.308 --> 06:03.210
But you understand.

06:03.244 --> 06:05.212
Here we go.

06:05.787 --> 06:07.492
Palms together. There you go.

06:17.392 --> 06:19.395
(indistinct chatter, phones ringing)

06:22.029 --> 06:23.532
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:23.565 --> 06:25.067
- Did you say anything?
- No.

06:25.099 --> 06:26.936
You sure? You need to tell me.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.404
Guess I should have expected this.

06:29.964 --> 06:31.038
Is he your client, too?

06:31.485 --> 06:32.629
Damn right he is.

06:32.661 --> 06:34.208
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Detective?

06:34.241 --> 06:35.934
Investigating a murder.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.679
You cuff me, you intimidate him,
and you bring him down here

06:37.712 --> 06:39.515
to try to coerce a written
statement out of him?

06:39.548 --> 06:40.449
I'm not coercing anything.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.318
- Is there a warrant for his arrest?
- Not yet,

06:42.351 --> 06:44.153
but we're dusting Bobby's
houseboat for fingerprints,

06:44.186 --> 06:46.287
and I can't wait to see what turns up.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.690
Let me make this very clear.

06:47.722 --> 06:49.557
Next time you take one of my clients

06:49.590 --> 06:50.725
into custody without a warrant,

06:50.758 --> 06:52.994
I will file with IAD, and I will sue you

06:53.027 --> 06:54.595
for civil rights violations so fast,

06:54.628 --> 06:56.097
your head is gonna spin.

06:56.130 --> 06:57.967
- You're upset.
- Damn right I'm upset.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.336
I get this way
when the PD breaks the law.

07:00.368 --> 07:01.537
You had no right to interrogate him.

07:01.562 --> 07:03.104
- Let's go.
- Not true.

07:03.349 --> 07:05.308
We have a witness who says
she saw your client

07:05.342 --> 07:07.576
pay Bobby a visit
on the day he disappeared.

07:07.601 --> 07:08.972
It means nothing, and you know it.

07:09.005 --> 07:11.347
No D.A. would ever file on that.

07:11.380 --> 07:13.825
Let's cut the crap, Counselor.

07:13.859 --> 07:15.748
You think I don't see
the connections here?

07:15.773 --> 07:18.127
Bobby Marks, Darryl Williams,
you and your friends.

07:18.161 --> 07:20.591
It must have been a very
eventful nine months at Quitman.

07:20.758 --> 07:23.729
Especially when you consider
Red Tyson went missing, too.

07:24.769 --> 07:26.731
I think this all goes back to E block.

07:27.463 --> 07:29.869
I can't prove it right now, but I will.

07:30.479 --> 07:32.566
So instead of making threats,

07:32.871 --> 07:35.674
I suggest you think
about preparing your defense.

07:41.078 --> 07:42.496
You thinking about Amy?

07:43.015 --> 07:44.848
Thinking about lots of things.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.903
You know what always
helps me with Boots?

07:50.735 --> 07:51.644
Church.

07:53.423 --> 07:55.577
Yeah, no, no, it's not really my thing.

07:55.626 --> 07:57.507
I know. I don't mean, like,

07:57.532 --> 08:01.805
hallelujah, praise the Lord,
speaking in tongues.

08:01.839 --> 08:03.168
I mean the place.

08:03.739 --> 08:06.379
Sometimes I go there,
even when no one's there,

08:06.413 --> 08:09.490
just... think about him.

08:10.107 --> 08:11.666
I know of a good one.

08:13.912 --> 08:15.601
GIL: <i>Jackie, I can't.</i>

08:15.633 --> 08:16.814
I can't. I can't handle this!

08:16.839 --> 08:17.821
I can't go back to jail!

08:17.846 --> 08:19.067
You're not going back to jail, Gil.

08:19.092 --> 08:20.507
You heard what she said...
they got a witness

08:20.532 --> 08:22.239
- who saw me get on Bobby's boat.
- Cops lie.

08:22.372 --> 08:24.007
She only said that to scare you.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.076
- Yeah? Well, it's working.
- All right, listen to me.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.144
I'm gonna ask you a question,

08:27.177 --> 08:30.081
but I am treading
a very thin ethical line here.

08:30.432 --> 08:32.317
How well did you clean that boat?

08:33.716 --> 08:35.842
Jackie, I'm telling you,
we scrubbed it multiple times.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.922
And got rid of all the blood.

08:38.956 --> 08:40.173
I think we're okay.

08:40.691 --> 08:42.354
- All right?
- Why?

08:42.388 --> 08:44.327
- Did she say something about that?
- No, no, it's fine.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.163
I'm just... I'm-I'm a little
freaked out she knew about Red.

08:47.196 --> 08:49.200
Oh, all right, well, she's a cop, so,

08:49.233 --> 08:50.891
you know, they read
the missing persons reports.

08:50.923 --> 08:52.530
How does she know about E block?

08:52.563 --> 08:54.531
It's just... it's-it's weird.

09:03.211 --> 09:05.815
I don't know how you got these,
but thank you.

09:06.558 --> 09:08.950
Ray Carroll's been bleeding me dry

09:08.984 --> 09:11.046
for 25 years over this stuff.

09:11.387 --> 09:12.815
Tell me how this works.

09:13.154 --> 09:15.279
He's got stuff like this
on a lot of people.

09:15.924 --> 09:18.408
What does he expect
from you besides money?

09:19.663 --> 09:20.735
Jessie, I...

09:21.263 --> 09:22.983
I really don't want to discuss it.

09:23.231 --> 09:25.533
But like I said, thank you for this.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.039
I don't think you understand.

09:29.052 --> 09:30.542
These are just copies.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.540
I still have the originals.

09:32.855 --> 09:34.276
What?!

09:34.309 --> 09:35.984
You may not bleed
for Ray Carroll anymore,

09:36.009 --> 09:37.655
but now you're gonna bleed for me.

09:37.976 --> 09:39.642
And you are gonna start by telling me

09:39.676 --> 09:41.704
every single thing you know about him

09:41.729 --> 09:42.684
and how he operates.

09:42.709 --> 09:46.418
And if you leave out
even one tiny detail,

09:46.443 --> 09:48.985
my first phone call's gonna be
to the <i>Houston Chronicle.</i>

09:50.530 --> 09:51.843
Or your wife.

09:52.986 --> 09:54.634
I'll let you pick.

10:01.377 --> 10:02.833
How are you, honey?

10:03.144 --> 10:05.447
After all that terribleness last week?

10:05.480 --> 10:08.116
Oh, I'm fine. I'm good.
Everything's good.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.428
Marina, I like you,

10:09.461 --> 10:11.121
and you don't have to pretend with me

10:11.154 --> 10:13.267
that everything is rainbows
and unicorns.

10:15.058 --> 10:17.720
Jackson and I are going
through a bit of a rough patch.

10:19.104 --> 10:22.119
The kind where you stop wearing
your engagement ring?

10:23.580 --> 10:25.120
I'm sorry, sweetie.

10:27.529 --> 10:30.144
It's just that the timing
is really awful.

10:30.221 --> 10:32.859
Let me guess. The invitations
have already gone out?

10:33.183 --> 10:35.025
(chuckles) I wish it was that simple.

10:35.779 --> 10:39.209
It seems that on top of everything else,

10:39.817 --> 10:41.546
I'm also pregnant.

10:42.086 --> 10:43.466
Oh, my...

10:45.296 --> 10:46.542
goodness. Wow.

10:46.567 --> 10:49.273
Does, uh, Jackson know?

10:52.529 --> 10:53.461
I just think I had

10:53.486 --> 10:55.808
certain expectations
about our relationship

10:55.833 --> 10:58.787
that were unrealistically high.

10:59.255 --> 11:00.774
Don't you blame yourself for that.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.589
If there's one thing
that men do really well,

11:03.614 --> 11:05.490
it's make big, beautiful promises.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.235
(laughter)

11:11.260 --> 11:12.928
Hey, be serious for a moment.

11:12.953 --> 11:14.222
I have something important to say.

11:14.453 --> 11:15.754
(laughs)

11:15.779 --> 11:16.507
What?

11:17.429 --> 11:18.773
(sniffles)

11:23.978 --> 11:25.488
Oh, my God.

11:27.982 --> 11:29.365
Marina Nagle,

11:29.823 --> 11:32.227
will you give this boy from
halfway to nowhere permission

11:32.252 --> 11:34.782
to be your slavishly devoted,

11:34.952 --> 11:40.191
unwaveringly honest,
loyal and loving husband?

11:41.188 --> 11:42.557
Till death do us part?

11:44.766 --> 11:45.831
Yes.

11:54.376 --> 11:57.478
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be
talking about my personal life.

11:57.512 --> 11:59.441
Don't be silly. I asked you.

11:59.634 --> 12:01.446
Now that you are being so honest,

12:01.770 --> 12:03.255
I have to, too.

12:04.499 --> 12:06.079
I'm having second thoughts

12:06.112 --> 12:08.902
about retaining your firm, and it is...

12:08.927 --> 12:10.742
I swear on my grandmother's grave...

12:10.767 --> 12:13.079
not because of you.

12:13.435 --> 12:14.601
Is it Jackson?

12:15.028 --> 12:16.192
Well, yes.

12:17.646 --> 12:19.704
When I bring someone
into my inner circle,

12:19.729 --> 12:21.885
I need to know exactly who they are,

12:21.910 --> 12:24.695
and that I can count on
them being that person

12:24.720 --> 12:28.140
day in and day out with no surprises.

12:28.944 --> 12:30.335
Does that make sense?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.022
(hinges squeaking)

13:00.280 --> 13:01.318
(door closes)

13:05.205 --> 13:07.174
♪ ♪

13:23.598 --> 13:26.035
(pencils clattering on floor)

13:36.011 --> 13:38.015
♪ ♪

13:43.565 --> 13:45.602
(clattering)

13:53.078 --> 13:55.214

- Yeah?

14:01.086 --> 14:02.755
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:02.788 --> 14:04.256
I have something you need to see.

14:04.289 --> 14:05.726
Come on in.

14:05.926 --> 14:07.382
<i>They met 25 years ago,</i>

14:07.414 --> 14:10.197
then out of the blue, Carroll
offers him twice the going rate

14:10.231 --> 14:11.966
for a piece of land in Louisiana.

14:11.999 --> 14:13.518
Next thing you know,
he's getting invited

14:13.543 --> 14:15.202
to the warden's parties, hunting trips,

14:15.236 --> 14:16.803
and on the parole board.

14:16.836 --> 14:19.006
So when Hamm decides
he doesn't want anything more

14:19.039 --> 14:20.859
to do with him, that's when
Carroll shows him the pictures

14:20.892 --> 14:22.032
of the parties.

14:22.065 --> 14:24.348
He's been blackmailing him ever since.

14:24.879 --> 14:26.355
Deed records for the land.

14:26.827 --> 14:28.563
It's not too far from Quitman
and Ray bought it

14:28.588 --> 14:30.190
the same year that you guys were there.

14:30.224 --> 14:32.693
I mean, you think it could be something?

14:32.718 --> 14:34.311
You never know.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.683
(sighs) I'm worried about Gil.

14:37.158 --> 14:39.360
Don't be. They don't
have anything on him

14:39.393 --> 14:40.474
they can make stick.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.561
How's Marina doing?

14:44.023 --> 14:46.075
Well, she gave me the ring back, so...

14:46.412 --> 14:48.488
Oh, God, Jackson, I'm sorry.

14:48.802 --> 14:50.537
It's really gotten that bad?

14:50.562 --> 14:52.565
(door opens)

14:56.864 --> 14:57.932
I came by to get some clothes.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.233
I thought you'd be at work already.

14:59.923 --> 15:01.610
Th-This is nothing, baby.

15:01.697 --> 15:02.965
If you think this is something,

15:02.998 --> 15:04.633
- you're wrong.
- Please don't insult me.

15:04.666 --> 15:05.537
We were working on something.

15:05.569 --> 15:07.635
- In our own house?
- Baby, baby,

15:07.668 --> 15:09.153
no, baby...

15:16.445 --> 15:17.813
DENNIS: <i>We had a deal,</i>

15:17.846 --> 15:18.732
Terry!

15:18.766 --> 15:21.918
You said set you up with Pablo
and this would all be over.

15:21.952 --> 15:24.342
Yeah, well, my needs have changed.

15:24.367 --> 15:27.055
All right? I got a new supplier,
but no stash house yet.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.361
It's just one more shipment.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.227
It's not your church, Terry.

15:30.252 --> 15:31.278
You sure about that?

15:31.619 --> 15:32.561
'Cause I seem to recall

15:32.595 --> 15:35.298
paying for everything you do
at that church.

15:35.331 --> 15:37.300
Or maybe you don't need
my money anymore.

15:37.332 --> 15:39.068
Leesha knows.

15:40.369 --> 15:41.737
What?

15:41.769 --> 15:43.639
I was moving the bricks
you left in the closet

15:43.672 --> 15:45.241
into my office the other day.

15:45.274 --> 15:47.210
She walked right in and surprised me.

15:47.242 --> 15:49.377
Saw the drugs, everything.

15:49.410 --> 15:51.313
And now she thinks <i>I'm</i> the one hustling.

15:51.346 --> 15:52.741
- She...
- Calm down.

15:53.515 --> 15:54.851
Now, what did you say?

15:54.884 --> 15:57.553
Well, I had the decency
not to tell her it was you.

15:57.586 --> 16:00.011
Look, I love and I cherish that girl.

16:00.556 --> 16:03.326
And if you think you're gonna
ruin my relationship with her

16:03.359 --> 16:05.528
over some ridiculous charade that you're

16:05.561 --> 16:07.697
the neighborhood flower man,
you're wrong.

16:07.730 --> 16:10.765
You need to take
responsibility for who you are.

16:10.798 --> 16:13.059
Lying to your flesh and blood
ain't the way, brother.

16:13.092 --> 16:13.688
Dennis...

16:13.713 --> 16:15.789
No, don't "Dennis" me, man.
Now, she about

16:15.820 --> 16:17.426
the best thing you have in your life.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.140
If you want to hold on to her...

16:20.308 --> 16:21.821
you're got to tell her the truth.

16:22.644 --> 16:25.164
Before she figures it out for herself,

16:25.189 --> 16:26.539
which she will do.

16:30.186 --> 16:31.821
Hi. I need to talk to you.

16:31.854 --> 16:33.391
Yeah, come on in.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.660
I am going to ask you something

16:38.692 --> 16:40.761
and please, just tell me the truth.

16:40.794 --> 16:42.225
Of course.

16:42.596 --> 16:44.197
Did you agree to make Jackson
partner because

16:44.230 --> 16:46.768
you truly believe in him
or because you knew that

16:46.801 --> 16:47.969
it would make me happy?

16:48.002 --> 16:49.156
Because I believe in him.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.974
Why, are you questioning our decision?

16:52.005 --> 16:55.008
I'm questioning everything,
to be honest.

16:55.042 --> 16:58.212
Marina, you know how much I care
about you, but whatever problems

16:58.244 --> 16:59.743
the two of you are having at home...

16:59.775 --> 17:02.196
No, it's... it's not that.

17:03.917 --> 17:07.426
Diana Stockman is reconsidering
her decision to hire us

17:07.459 --> 17:09.622
because of Jackson's erratic behavior.

17:09.991 --> 17:11.830
Erratic how?

17:11.877 --> 17:14.398
Well, he ducked out of
two meetings with her.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.866
And when Diana visited me

17:15.897 --> 17:18.353
in the hospital, he was...

17:19.073 --> 17:20.667
I'm not sure how to describe this...

17:21.636 --> 17:23.627
he was extremely argumentative.

17:23.828 --> 17:24.904
About what?

17:24.935 --> 17:27.705
Her relationship with
Ray Carroll, of all things.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.709
And why she chose our firm.

17:29.742 --> 17:32.083
It was embarrassing, and...

17:33.646 --> 17:36.354
I felt obligated, as your
partner, to let you know.

17:37.034 --> 17:37.790
Okay.

17:38.885 --> 17:41.511
I'll, uh... I'll talk to him.

17:44.569 --> 17:45.660
Boom.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.382
Forensics report
on Bobby Marks' houseboat.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.898
They find anything?

17:49.932 --> 17:50.719
Oh, yeah.

17:50.751 --> 17:52.320
And you're not gonna believe it.

17:55.336 --> 17:56.425
Let's go.

17:57.726 --> 17:59.895
(low, indistinct conversation)

17:59.928 --> 18:02.964
Uh, I don't if this is a good idea.

18:02.997 --> 18:04.700
A lightning bolt's liable to shoot down

18:04.732 --> 18:06.567
and blow up this whole place.

18:07.091 --> 18:08.337
Tell you what,

18:08.370 --> 18:09.838
we'll light a candle for Amy,

18:09.871 --> 18:11.440
one for Boots.

18:12.435 --> 18:14.508
If that's all you think you can stand,

18:14.542 --> 18:16.111
I promise we can leave.

18:16.502 --> 18:17.697
Deal?

18:19.289 --> 18:20.348
All right.

18:20.382 --> 18:22.750
All right. Come on.

18:52.814 --> 18:53.949
Sit for a bit.

18:53.981 --> 18:55.350
All right.

19:02.977 --> 19:03.971
Annie.

19:04.513 --> 19:05.676
Hi.

19:06.247 --> 19:08.516
Dennis, this is my friend Shawn.

19:08.957 --> 19:11.220
Shawn, this is Dennis.

19:11.253 --> 19:12.321
(shouting, laughing)

19:12.353 --> 19:15.157
He was the pastor who came
to my house when Boots died.

19:15.189 --> 19:16.604
Actually, I'm not a pastor.

19:16.992 --> 19:19.928
I'm... I'm the director
of community outreach here.

19:19.962 --> 19:21.664
- Oh.
- But grief counseling

19:21.696 --> 19:23.377
is part of the job description, so...

19:23.409 --> 19:24.375
Oh, right.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.183
Anyway, welcome
to the New Hope Assembly.

19:27.788 --> 19:28.652
Dennis.

19:28.816 --> 19:29.790
Yeah.

19:30.552 --> 19:31.670
Dennis Lowen?

19:31.695 --> 19:33.129
(shouting)

19:33.639 --> 19:34.467
That's right.

19:35.110 --> 19:37.048
Annie, I need you to step outside.

19:39.332 --> 19:40.700
I'm sorry, is there something wrong?

19:40.732 --> 19:42.701
Annie, I need you to leave.

19:42.735 --> 19:44.304
Shawn, what is going on?

19:44.336 --> 19:46.341
Cell block E, Quitman, right?

19:46.605 --> 19:47.965
How's your brother Terry?

19:48.540 --> 19:50.442
What, you didn't think
I would recognize you?

19:50.476 --> 19:51.911
That was a long time ago, man.

19:51.943 --> 19:53.142
Shawn...

19:53.813 --> 19:55.649
People change, now, brother.

19:55.681 --> 19:56.462
Don't "brother" me.

19:57.017 --> 19:58.408
I want you to stay away
from her, understand?

19:58.433 --> 19:59.355
Shawn, please.

19:59.388 --> 20:02.588
If you come near her again,
I swear I will kill you.

20:02.622 --> 20:03.623
Why don't we just all calm down.

20:03.655 --> 20:05.624
- (grunting)
- Shawn!

20:05.658 --> 20:06.825
- (grunting)
- Hold it!

20:06.858 --> 20:08.027
- Hey, pal!
- Get off me!

20:08.060 --> 20:09.962
- Come on. - Get off me!
- Shawn!

20:09.996 --> 20:11.864
What, you didn't think this
was gonna come back on you?!

20:11.898 --> 20:14.000
Huh? You didn't think
this was gonna come back?!

20:14.033 --> 20:15.769
Huh, Dennis?! Well, I'm back!

20:15.802 --> 20:17.003
- I'm coming back!
- Get out of here.

20:17.036 --> 20:19.339
MAN: Get out of here, man.

20:19.372 --> 20:20.340
Get off me!

20:22.325 --> 20:25.295
- What?! What y'all want?
- Come... Shawn, come on.

20:25.327 --> 20:26.863
You knew him a Quitman?

20:26.895 --> 20:29.265
That place was... hell on Earth.

20:29.298 --> 20:31.500
And Dennis was one of the reasons.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.870
Him, his brother Terry, Darryl, Eddie.

20:33.903 --> 20:36.338
They hurt us. All of us.

20:36.372 --> 20:37.941
I can't believe he was in my house.

20:37.973 --> 20:40.309
Don't think for a second
that was by coincidence.

20:40.343 --> 20:42.679
- What?
- He was scoping you out, Annie.

20:42.711 --> 20:45.347
All right? He was taking
a read on the situation.

20:45.381 --> 20:47.417
I tell you this... what
Boots did to Darryl,

20:47.450 --> 20:49.013
I'll do to that bastard
ten time over, I swear!

20:49.038 --> 20:49.719
No, Shawn.

20:49.751 --> 20:52.454
Please, don't. I mean it.

20:52.488 --> 20:54.587
This has to stop.

20:54.971 --> 20:56.860
I cannot take losing somebody else.

21:00.322 --> 21:02.191
You promise me, Shawn.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.769
(church bell ringing)

21:10.717 --> 21:12.409
SHAWN: <i>The dude is working at a church!</i>

21:12.443 --> 21:14.358
You know, I'd like
to interrupt a sermon one day

21:14.383 --> 21:15.589
and let those people know the real deal

21:15.623 --> 21:16.889
about their good brother Dennis.

21:17.050 --> 21:18.534
I'd pay to see that.

21:23.223 --> 21:24.380
What's that?

21:25.512 --> 21:27.107
It's the warden's campaign schedule.

21:30.903 --> 21:32.454
I'm going down, Shawnie.

21:33.366 --> 21:36.094
Uh, I killed Bobby
and the cops know it, but...

21:37.479 --> 21:39.330
I cannot live knowing that the warden

21:39.364 --> 21:40.826
never paid for what he did.

21:41.537 --> 21:44.117
So he's gonna be at Bobby's wake

21:44.658 --> 21:47.319
at 4:30, and so will I.

21:48.368 --> 21:49.751
And I'm gonna say hello.

21:50.516 --> 21:52.759
And I'm gonna shoot him
right between the eyes.

21:54.288 --> 21:57.050
And then I'm gonna confess
to killing Bobby by myself,

21:57.084 --> 21:58.667
so they can't touch you or Jackie.

21:59.019 --> 22:00.088
Problem solved.

22:01.575 --> 22:02.982
Have you lost your damn mind?

22:03.483 --> 22:05.551
And what makes you think going
over there to kill the warden

22:05.584 --> 22:07.569
is gonna all of a sudden fix everything?

22:07.625 --> 22:09.715
- 'Cause it will.
- Really?

22:09.809 --> 22:11.872
So, when your ass
is rotting in prison...

22:12.345 --> 22:13.882
you gonna feel good
about the fact that Terry

22:13.914 --> 22:14.767
is still out there?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.817
After everything he did to us?

22:17.082 --> 22:18.859
Why don't you, uh, make a list?

22:19.151 --> 22:20.834
Yeah, yeah, come on. I'm serious.

22:20.867 --> 22:21.786
Write it down for me.

22:22.013 --> 22:23.782
List all the people you got to kill

22:23.816 --> 22:25.018
to make this thing right.

22:25.050 --> 22:27.452
And what about Dennis...
why does he skate?

22:27.486 --> 22:30.290
What about all those guards who
knew exactly what was going on

22:30.323 --> 22:31.958
and didn't do a damn thing to help us?

22:31.990 --> 22:32.863
What about them?!

22:32.895 --> 22:35.028
Hey, I'm just messing with you.

22:36.729 --> 22:38.238
Get you riled up.

22:38.564 --> 22:39.700
That's it.

22:40.373 --> 22:41.607
Seriously, man...

22:42.233 --> 22:43.120
where did you get that schedule?

22:43.153 --> 22:44.333
I stole it from Jessie.

22:44.623 --> 22:45.735
Tell me you ain't
gonna do something stupid.

22:45.926 --> 22:47.595
- Aw, come on. Listen, it's not...
- You swear to me.

22:47.620 --> 22:48.955
- I... Listen...
- Swear it!

22:48.980 --> 22:50.414
I was joking, I was joking,

22:50.439 --> 22:52.308
I was joking, I'm sorry.

22:52.811 --> 22:55.615
I'm fine. I was just blowing off
some steam, that's all.

22:58.162 --> 23:00.532
All right, man, I'm gonna go pay
the subs at the Montrose house.

23:00.557 --> 23:01.562
Okay.

23:07.526 --> 23:08.252
Hey.

23:10.863 --> 23:12.003
I love you, man.

23:13.531 --> 23:15.338
I love you, too, bro.

23:24.535 --> 23:25.467
Dad?

23:25.870 --> 23:27.418
Hey, Leesh.

23:27.872 --> 23:29.260
You're out early.

23:29.739 --> 23:31.434
I skipped last period.

23:33.643 --> 23:34.688
Why is that, young lady?

23:35.075 --> 23:36.398
I need to tell you something.

23:36.675 --> 23:38.421
I think Uncle Dennis is a dealer.

23:38.778 --> 23:41.548
I saw him hiding drugs in the church.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.186
I know I probably
shouldn't say anything,

23:43.220 --> 23:45.919
but I can't believe he'd
pretend to be a person

23:45.952 --> 23:47.487
everyone thinks he is

23:47.586 --> 23:48.973
when he's really just a criminal.

23:49.100 --> 23:52.216
Baby, listen, okay? I do know about it.

23:53.234 --> 23:55.122
And this is on me.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.227
I should've told you the
truth a long time ago.

23:58.261 --> 23:59.511
Why didn't you?

23:59.544 --> 24:02.623
Because I didn't want my
little girl to worry about it.

24:03.448 --> 24:04.894
I know...

24:06.150 --> 24:08.152
that your Uncle Dennis

24:08.186 --> 24:09.551
is a very troubled man.

24:10.254 --> 24:12.524
But just because he's not
everything he says he is

24:12.556 --> 24:14.305
doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

24:15.058 --> 24:16.593
Just like I do.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.204
(Gil babbles playfully)

24:26.237 --> 24:27.738
<i>Molto bene.</i>

24:27.772 --> 24:31.643
<i>Bonjourno, bonjourno,
bonjourno, buonasera.</i>

24:31.676 --> 24:33.113
Wow.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.305
What's all this?

24:34.338 --> 24:37.047
Nothing. Just wanted to, uh,

24:37.081 --> 24:39.150
make you some lunch.

24:39.182 --> 24:41.285
Good, I'm starving.

24:42.352 --> 24:43.656
You didn't make me nothing?

24:43.688 --> 24:45.976
Sorry, doll, we're
all out of Pop Tarts and beer.

24:46.001 --> 24:47.411
Uh-huh.

24:49.600 --> 24:53.071
Hey, um, you hear back
from the police yet?

24:53.104 --> 24:54.377
No.

24:54.706 --> 24:55.784
You okay?

24:55.933 --> 24:57.735
Yeah. Jackson's on it.

24:57.975 --> 25:00.335
Not much I can really do
about it anyway, you know?

25:05.367 --> 25:06.502
It's okay?

25:06.534 --> 25:07.731
Mm-hmm.

25:09.790 --> 25:11.059
I love you, Jessie.

25:13.735 --> 25:15.052
I love you, too.

25:16.778 --> 25:17.639
Hey.

25:18.379 --> 25:19.814
You sure you're okay?

25:20.983 --> 25:24.118
Yeah. I just...

25:24.152 --> 25:26.022
I do want to let you know,
though, that...

25:29.523 --> 25:31.060
...you know, no matter what happens,

25:31.092 --> 25:32.735
you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.424
Hey.

25:42.483 --> 25:43.636
You got something?

25:43.669 --> 25:46.517
Yeah. Man, it took a while to unravel.

25:46.731 --> 25:49.100
But it looks like a year
after he bought this land,

25:49.134 --> 25:52.104
Carroll sold it to a company
called ROC Holdings.

25:52.137 --> 25:53.038
Never heard of 'em.

25:53.071 --> 25:55.113
But I do recognize the parent company...

25:55.772 --> 25:58.077
Corrections Services of America.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.725
We actually represent them.

26:01.245 --> 26:02.301
Since when?

26:02.547 --> 26:03.748
Since we took on

26:03.781 --> 26:05.538
Stockman Ventures as a client.

26:06.018 --> 26:07.353
It's one of their subsidiaries.

26:07.386 --> 26:09.254
AARON: Um, Jackson?

26:09.288 --> 26:10.670
Can I see you in my office, please?

26:11.895 --> 26:13.059
Yeah.

26:13.091 --> 26:14.392
Th-thank you.

26:14.426 --> 26:15.807
Thank you.

26:19.531 --> 26:21.333
Are you aware Diana Stockman controls

26:21.367 --> 26:23.002
one of the largest
private prison companies

26:23.034 --> 26:24.070
in America?

26:24.102 --> 26:26.404
I'm aware she has interests
in corrections, yes.

26:26.437 --> 26:29.026
Aaron, they imprison people for profit.

26:29.106 --> 26:30.675
Actually, courts imprison people.

26:30.707 --> 26:32.209
Governments contract out
to private vendors

26:32.243 --> 26:34.712
- to enforce those...
- Oh, so-so that makes it okay.

26:34.744 --> 26:38.649
Uh, maybe I should be asking
the questions, Jackson.

26:38.683 --> 26:41.019
Stockman could be the most
important client we've ever had,

26:41.052 --> 26:41.859
but because of you,

26:41.884 --> 26:44.408
Diana's questioning her
decision to hire us.

26:44.768 --> 26:46.370
Please tell me there's more to this

26:46.403 --> 26:47.903
than some moral objection you have

26:47.937 --> 26:50.274
to a perfectly legal business.

26:50.306 --> 26:51.092
Yeah, there is.

26:51.126 --> 26:52.562
Such as?

26:53.710 --> 26:55.645
Such as the fact that she's tight

26:55.679 --> 26:58.088
with a sleazeball like Ray Carroll,

26:58.113 --> 26:59.682
who was the warden at Quitman

26:59.716 --> 27:00.917
when a riot shut it down, after which

27:00.950 --> 27:02.586
he very conveniently
popped up on the board

27:02.611 --> 27:04.599
of the very same company
that took it private...

27:04.631 --> 27:07.989
Diana's company...
the same company now using kids

27:08.023 --> 27:10.427
as slave labor in their
warehousing building which,

27:10.460 --> 27:11.322
by the way, was just

27:11.356 --> 27:12.437
raided by the DEA.

27:12.471 --> 27:13.504
The DEA?

27:13.984 --> 27:15.365
Who'd they bust?

27:15.452 --> 27:18.409
(scoffs) Nobody. That's...

27:18.976 --> 27:20.283
That's not the point, Aaron.

27:20.315 --> 27:22.116
Then what is?

27:22.297 --> 27:24.733
Everything else sounds like
conjecture and innuendo.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.759
The point is these are not good people.

27:27.435 --> 27:29.258
We shouldn't be in business with them.

27:30.539 --> 27:32.441
(phone rings)

27:32.473 --> 27:33.992
I'm sorry, I...

27:34.475 --> 27:35.672
(phone beeps)

27:36.444 --> 27:38.967
It's... Uh, this is
my alarm company. I...

27:39.260 --> 27:40.395
I got to go, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:40.427 --> 27:41.543
Jackson.

27:42.097 --> 27:43.936
- I'm sorry.
- Jackson!

27:44.665 --> 27:46.668
(indistinct chatter)

27:51.505 --> 27:53.708
Liz, you better have a warrant for this.

27:53.742 --> 27:55.676
WINTERS: Found a print

27:55.710 --> 27:57.245
inside Bobby's houseboat.

27:57.278 --> 27:59.647
Imagine my surprise
when it turned out to be yours.

28:02.684 --> 28:04.286
You're searching my house
based on a single print?

28:04.318 --> 28:05.453
And a motive.

28:05.486 --> 28:07.655
- What motive?
- Grudge, prior grievances.

28:07.688 --> 28:09.123
None of that justifies a warrant.

28:09.156 --> 28:10.391
Take it up with the judge.

28:10.424 --> 28:13.361
Don't you have anything better to do,

28:13.395 --> 28:16.231
like-like find the person
who attacked my fiancée?

28:22.503 --> 28:25.006
My fiancée was assaulted.
That's for protection.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.804
Bag it and send it to Ballistics.

28:28.621 --> 28:31.437
This case just gets
more interesting every day,

28:31.471 --> 28:33.241
doesn't it, Counselor?

28:36.361 --> 28:37.623
(knocking)

28:38.582 --> 28:40.464
Jackson, what brings you back

28:40.497 --> 28:42.407
to the slums of the
District Attorney's Office?

28:42.967 --> 28:45.270
What can you tell me about Liz Winters?

28:45.303 --> 28:47.939
She's one of our best. Why?

28:47.971 --> 28:49.673
Well, I'm trying to figure out

28:49.707 --> 28:51.775
why a Gangs Squad detective
is investigating a murder

28:51.808 --> 28:54.478
four counties away.
Now, my client's involvement,

28:54.512 --> 28:56.781
it's flimsy, at best,
and she's on this thing

28:56.814 --> 28:58.650
like a pit bull
that hasn't eaten in two weeks.

28:58.682 --> 29:00.852
What can I say? She is a pit bull.

29:00.884 --> 29:02.420
We D.A.s kind of like it that way.

29:02.452 --> 29:04.756
Let me ask you this,
I have another client.

29:05.158 --> 29:07.858
He was killed in jail recently.

29:07.891 --> 29:09.727
Now, a lifer confessed,
but there was a man

29:09.760 --> 29:10.961
in the cell block with him.

29:10.995 --> 29:13.007
His name's Dooley. Do you know him?

29:13.297 --> 29:14.965
The Viking? Yeah.

29:14.998 --> 29:16.834
We had him up on assault.

29:16.868 --> 29:18.303
Turned up dead not long ago.

29:18.335 --> 29:20.438
Why'd you let him out
in the first place?

29:21.206 --> 29:24.007
Victoria, please,
I'm-I'm asking as a friend.

29:24.582 --> 29:25.678
Please.

29:28.379 --> 29:30.381
(chuckles)

29:33.484 --> 29:35.487
(keys clacking)

29:39.837 --> 29:41.958
The detective on the case

29:41.993 --> 29:44.429
said the witness refused to testify.

29:44.662 --> 29:46.363
And who was the detective?

29:47.248 --> 29:48.830
Liz Winters.

29:51.401 --> 29:53.422
JESSIE: Marina?

29:54.701 --> 29:56.664
Can I talk to you for a second?

30:10.370 --> 30:12.056
I just want to make sure that you know

30:12.090 --> 30:14.426
that there's absolutely nothing

30:14.458 --> 30:16.061
going on between me and Jackson.

30:16.736 --> 30:19.763
You have been alone with him
at my house,

30:19.796 --> 30:21.432
at least twice that I know of,

30:21.466 --> 30:23.481
but you're not having an affair?

30:23.668 --> 30:26.036
I swear to you, anything
that's happened between us

30:26.070 --> 30:28.080
is in the past. I am with Gil.

30:28.538 --> 30:30.674
And I can't bear to think
that I had something to do

30:30.708 --> 30:33.577
with your breakup. I have
already ruined his life once.

30:33.611 --> 30:35.880
The only reason he went to juvie
was because he was trying

30:35.912 --> 30:37.614
to protect me from my own drunk mother.

30:37.648 --> 30:40.017
- I know.
- I promise you,

30:40.400 --> 30:43.024
my only interest in Jackson now
is trying to help him.

30:43.388 --> 30:44.192
That's it.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.090
You want to help him?

30:47.584 --> 30:50.094
Help him do what, Jessie?

30:50.128 --> 30:51.664
Get justice.

30:52.616 --> 30:54.440
For what happened at Quitman.

30:54.832 --> 30:55.818
Okay.

30:58.568 --> 31:00.606
How much has he told you about that?

31:00.938 --> 31:02.474
That he went with his friends.

31:02.506 --> 31:04.875
And I am sure it wasn't pleasant.

31:06.190 --> 31:07.318
Marina...

31:07.911 --> 31:09.502
(sighs)

31:10.414 --> 31:12.054
...they were beaten,

31:13.038 --> 31:14.386
they were abused,

31:14.419 --> 31:16.034
and they were raped.

31:17.289 --> 31:18.598
All of them.

31:20.569 --> 31:23.627
Jackson's been through
some really dark things.

31:23.942 --> 31:24.894
Gil and Shawn, too.

31:24.929 --> 31:27.693
And they were my best friends.

31:29.225 --> 31:31.736
And I'm never gonna know what
that was truly like for them.

31:31.768 --> 31:33.650
So I am sorry,

31:34.570 --> 31:36.618
for what it's worth.

31:40.044 --> 31:42.013
- (door opens)
- (sniffles)

31:42.045 --> 31:44.048
(door closes)

31:45.048 --> 31:47.051
(shuddering breaths)

31:50.621 --> 31:53.124
(indistinct chatter)

31:58.094 --> 32:01.165
Why'd you tell the D.A. the
witness in the Klaus Dooley case

32:01.199 --> 32:02.766
refused to testify?

32:02.800 --> 32:04.035
I spoke to the man.

32:04.067 --> 32:05.903
He said he never refused.

32:05.937 --> 32:08.640
Which means you lied to the
D.A. and you let Dooley walk.

32:08.672 --> 32:10.074
Is that what you think happened?

32:10.106 --> 32:11.942
I don't think... I know.
'Cause you're bent, Liz.

32:16.214 --> 32:18.216
You knew he murdered my client in jail,

32:18.248 --> 32:20.651
and you put him on the street anyway.

32:20.685 --> 32:22.654
I think you're losing it, Counselor.

32:22.687 --> 32:24.789
Actually, I've never felt so clear.

32:24.822 --> 32:26.491
It's Terry Bausch, isn't it?

32:26.524 --> 32:28.593
That's how you know about
E Block, that's how you know

32:28.625 --> 32:31.061
about Red Tyson, that's why
you're trying to pin the murder

32:31.094 --> 32:33.797
of Bobby Marks on me. I didn't do it.

32:33.831 --> 32:36.801
But I am this close, this close,
to turning you in

32:36.833 --> 32:38.902
to the D.A. unless I get
some answers right now.

32:38.936 --> 32:41.287
What the hell happened to you, Liz?

32:43.940 --> 32:45.220
Look,

32:45.843 --> 32:47.911
we all make choices that we regret.

32:47.945 --> 32:49.684
I know what it's like to lie.

32:50.164 --> 32:52.784
I know what it's like to pretend
to be someone you're not.

32:52.816 --> 32:54.051
But you've got to hate this,

32:54.084 --> 32:56.054
because every instinct I have

32:56.086 --> 32:58.956
is telling me that this is
not who you really are.

32:58.989 --> 33:00.285
So talk to me.

33:00.591 --> 33:03.462
Talk to me so I don't have
to ruin your life.

33:06.296 --> 33:08.833
Fine. I'm going to the D.A.

33:12.203 --> 33:13.491
Wait.

33:19.575 --> 33:21.197
I could take you down

33:22.304 --> 33:23.615
or you could take me down,

33:23.648 --> 33:25.582
but either way Terry gets off clean.

33:28.018 --> 33:29.269
(sighs)

33:30.213 --> 33:32.044
My brother's in jail.

33:33.452 --> 33:35.793
He's a drug addict, a... fool,

33:35.825 --> 33:38.796
and a complete mess,
but he's my brother.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.549
And I need to keep him alive.

33:42.934 --> 33:44.836
I don't want you, Liz.

33:44.869 --> 33:45.893
I want Terry.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.939
We're not the ones
who should be suffering here.

33:48.972 --> 33:51.229
It's animals like him.

33:51.391 --> 33:54.177
I won't tell anyone about you.

33:54.211 --> 33:58.207
All I ask is that you leave me
and my friends alone.

34:01.285 --> 34:02.822
Do we have a deal?

34:18.302 --> 34:20.838
Hey, G. I saw Mario
at the job site today,

34:20.871 --> 34:22.833

about those measurements...

I know you want the warden.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.852
And we got a way to get him.

37:01.549 --> 37:03.151
That road he was on with Petey,

37:03.185 --> 37:05.020
you travel down that road 15 miles,

37:05.053 --> 37:07.890
it takes you to Louisiana.

37:07.922 --> 37:11.325
Now, three days after Petey disappeared,

37:11.359 --> 37:14.129
Carroll bought land over the border

37:14.161 --> 37:17.131
right off that exact same road.

37:17.165 --> 37:19.835
I think that's where he took him.

If I'm right... Hey, if I'm right,

Everything.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.610
Jessie told me.

38:00.641 --> 38:02.283
I wish that you'd told me yourself.

38:02.509 --> 38:04.580
If I'd known the truth,
I could've at least understood

38:04.612 --> 38:06.315
what you were going through.

38:06.348 --> 38:08.555
You're right. I...

38:09.940 --> 38:11.451
I should have told you.

38:13.087 --> 38:14.615
Why didn't you?

38:19.491 --> 38:21.260
'Cause I was ashamed.

38:24.292 --> 38:26.202
I thought you'd think less of me.

38:27.268 --> 38:28.803
When did all this start?

38:29.004 --> 38:31.440
The day Boots attacked Darryl Williams.

38:31.891 --> 38:33.643
- Was that planned?
- No.

38:34.475 --> 38:36.878
But Ray Carroll
and the people he works with,

38:36.911 --> 38:38.467
they killed Boots for it.

38:38.946 --> 38:40.443
So that's what you've been doing,

38:40.949 --> 38:42.581
trying to get back at Ray Carroll?

38:46.823 --> 38:48.342
You know what happened

38:49.223 --> 38:51.942
the day before Boots attacked Darryl?

38:53.695 --> 38:55.439
I asked you to marry me.

39:00.023 --> 39:01.631
Do you remember what I said?

39:03.519 --> 39:05.015
Every word.

39:06.373 --> 39:09.509
All that I'm hoping for is
that you somehow find a way t...

39:10.978 --> 39:13.284
to give me a second chance.

39:16.475 --> 39:18.653
- You were leaving.
- Marina,

39:18.687 --> 39:20.644
we're close to something,
something that's gonna...

39:21.723 --> 39:23.450
put an end to all of this.

39:26.995 --> 39:28.972
Well, then you should go.

39:39.674 --> 39:43.145
JACKSON: <i>I think the warden
was clearing those stumps to make way</i>

39:43.178 --> 39:45.413
for the new warehouses, but
he didn't want anyone knowing

39:45.446 --> 39:47.548
that he was making kids
work with toxic chemicals.

39:47.582 --> 39:50.719
So when Petey got hurt,
he had to keep it quiet.

39:51.552 --> 39:53.588
So he kills him, he
buries him in this land,

39:53.620 --> 39:57.191
and then buys the land to
make sure it stays quiet.

39:57.225 --> 39:59.161
Then he sells that land
to the same person

39:59.194 --> 40:00.529
