08:22.002 --> 08:23.503
That'll work.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.630
[knocks]

08:28.842 --> 08:30.385
That's him.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.220
Dad, you never saw us.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.597
And if he asks where we are,

08:32.262 --> 08:34.597
we were never here

08:34.639 --> 08:36.266
and we're never

08:34.639 --> 08:36.266
coming back.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.226
Got it.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.647
How annoying

08:40.270 --> 08:42.647
could one kid be?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.232
Honey, I'm home.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.119
S-Steve Urkel

08:53.658 --> 08:56.119
at your service.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.375
Hi, Steve.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.002
Listen, Steve, uh, DJ

09:01.416 --> 09:04.002
and Julie were never here

09:04.044 --> 09:05.753
and they're

09:04.044 --> 09:05.753
never coming back.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.340
Never? Oh, that's okay.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.340
I'll wait.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.010
Say, do you have

09:10.091 --> 09:12.010
a spare accordion?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.262
We can jam.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.639
No, my accordion

09:14.304 --> 09:16.639
is in the shop.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.184
How you doing?

09:16.681 --> 09:19.184
I'm, I'm Danny Tanner, DJ's dad.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.227
That's Jesse Katsopolis,

09:19.226 --> 09:20.227
my brother-in-law.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.313
- Hi.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.313
- Joey's not here.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.899
He's, uh,

09:23.355 --> 09:25.899
Jesse's best man.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.985
I'm just the head usher.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.946
Well, geez, Danny,

09:29.027 --> 09:31.946
you sound a little bitter.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.908
May I suggest that you just suck

09:31.988 --> 09:34.908
it up and get on with your life.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.744
Kid's got a point.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.372
Boy, am I hungry.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.372
Got any cheese?

09:40.414 --> 09:42.123
Uh, you can't

09:40.414 --> 09:42.123
go in there

09:42.165 --> 09:44.709
because, um,

09:42.165 --> 09:44.709
we're out of cheese.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.003
Oh, no problemo,

09:44.751 --> 09:47.003
I'll just pour a glass of milk

09:47.045 --> 09:49.089
and wait for it to curdle.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.508
Uh, Steve, Steve,

09:49.130 --> 09:51.508
Steevo.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.885
Steve, I-I can't

09:52.467 --> 09:53.885
help noticing

09:53.927 --> 09:55.178
that you, uh, walk like

09:53.927 --> 09:55.178
the you still have

09:55.220 --> 09:56.555
the hanger in your shirt.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.224
- Oh, why, thank you.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.224
- You're welcome.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.725
Steve, I'd like

09:59.266 --> 10:00.725
to help you

10:00.767 --> 10:05.188
because, uh, quite frankly,

10:00.767 --> 10:05.188
you need help.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.648
See, when you're walking, you

10:05.230 --> 10:07.648
got, you gotta be loose, man.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.859
You gotta kinda just

10:07.690 --> 10:09.859
let it be cool, you see.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.361
That's it. Loosen up.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.363
Be very fluid.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.448
Flu-fluidity is the key.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.116
That's the move.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.116
That's it, now.

10:16.157 --> 10:20.036
Once you get it going, you shift

10:16.157 --> 10:20.036
the weight and go, you see.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.330
And it's a strut, and it's cool.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.916
And it's a strut, and it's cool.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.916
Like that. See?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.043
- Very inspiring.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.043
- Alright.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.638
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.224
That's, that's close.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.059
Yeah, well.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.145
Well, that was

10:43.101 --> 10:45.145
a walk on the wild side.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.689
But now let's try it

10:46.729 --> 10:48.689
with your elbows out.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.609
You'll find it's much

10:48.731 --> 10:50.609
better for circulation.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.985
- Like this?

10:50.650 --> 10:51.985
- Yeah.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.153
Alright, I'll try it.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.530
- Yeah, you're doing fine.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.530
- Okay.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.615
Hey, you know, I do feel

10:55.572 --> 10:56.615
the blood flowing--

10:56.656 --> 10:57.824
Yeah.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.826
What am I doing?

10:59.867 --> 11:02.287
Well, here's another fun way

10:59.867 --> 11:02.287
to kill time.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.998
Let's share our life stories.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.998
I'll go first.

11:05.039 --> 11:08.126
I was born on a cold

11:05.039 --> 11:08.126
Chicago night, 1976

11:08.168 --> 11:10.128
the year of America's

11:08.168 --> 11:10.128
bicentennial.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.963
My mom was in

11:10.170 --> 11:11.963
a great deal of pain

11:12.005 --> 11:13.340
and I was charging through--

11:13.381 --> 11:15.383
I think I hear

11:13.381 --> 11:15.383
the girls coming home.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.718
Right in the kitchen.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.718
There you go.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.095
Anyhow, good day, gentlemen.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.847
Okay.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.390
(Steve)

11:20.888 --> 11:22.390
'Oh, ladies.'

11:22.432 --> 11:24.767
[screaming]

11:24.809 --> 11:26.645
- Hey.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.188
Guess who got some new glasses?

11:28.229 --> 11:30.440
Guess who never

11:28.229 --> 11:30.440
wants to wear them?

11:30.482 --> 11:32.942
Oh, come on,

11:30.482 --> 11:32.942
I'll bet they look great.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.195
I look like

11:32.984 --> 11:35.195
a total dweeb.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.614
Oh, come on.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.614
Hey, look at this.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.658
I wear

11:37.656 --> 11:39.658
reading glasses.

11:39.698 --> 11:42.869
And yeah, there. Do I look

11:39.698 --> 11:42.869
like a total dweeb?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.413
Not totally.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.000
Honey, put them on.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.000
Let us see 'em.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.169
Okay.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.590
There. You saw them.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.008
You know, for a second there

11:57.050 --> 11:58.301
I thought you actually

11:57.050 --> 11:58.301
looked sharp.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.802
Yeah, you look

11:58.343 --> 11:59.802
very sophisticated.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.012
That's what

11:59.844 --> 12:01.012
I've been telling you since

12:01.054 --> 12:02.681
we left the eye doctor, Steph.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.183
Thanks, but I know

12:02.721 --> 12:05.183
you're just being nice

12:05.225 --> 12:07.185
because you're my family.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.274
Do I look like a dweeb?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.903
- No.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.738
You're just being nice

12:16.944 --> 12:19.738
'cause you're my family.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.867
Hi, Comet.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.285
You'll be honest.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.413
What do you think

12:24.327 --> 12:26.413
of my new glasses?

12:34.212 --> 12:35.463
I knew it.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.924
I'm the biggest geek

12:35.505 --> 12:37.924
in third grade.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.265
[instrumental music]

12:46.891 --> 12:48.809
[gasps]

12:59.362 --> 13:01.822
- I think we lost him.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.822
- Lost who?

13:03.533 --> 13:06.578
Just some pesky kid that keeps

13:03.533 --> 13:06.578
following us around.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.205
You know, some people just don't

13:06.620 --> 13:09.205
know when they're not wanted.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.584
Hi, DJ.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.210
Hi, Julie.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.837
Hi, kid I don't know.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.632
Steve, this is

13:16.879 --> 13:18.632
my sister Michelle.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.925
Well, it's a pleasure

13:18.673 --> 13:20.925
to meet you, Michelle.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.720
Why do you talk

13:20.967 --> 13:23.720
like a Mickey Mouse?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.641
That's because

13:25.513 --> 13:27.641
I'm from Chicago.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.476
Want to feed my piggy?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.561
Well, sure.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.563
Here's a bright,

13:31.603 --> 13:33.563
shiny penny.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.232
Michelle, did you know that

13:33.605 --> 13:36.232
with prevailing interest rates

13:36.274 --> 13:38.151
that penny will be worth

13:36.274 --> 13:38.151
almost three cents

13:38.192 --> 13:40.236
at the turn of the century?

13:40.278 --> 13:41.738
Yes, I did.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.285
Steve, this is

13:44.658 --> 13:47.285
my other sister Stephanie.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.953
Hi, Stephanie.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.747
Nice to meet you, Steve.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.373
I don't mean to be rude

13:52.415 --> 13:55.960
but I really don't feel

13:52.415 --> 13:55.960
like company right now.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.504
Is everything okay, Steph?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.714
I just feel

13:57.545 --> 13:59.714
like being alone.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.007
Come on, girls.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.883
The little lady

14:01.048 --> 14:02.883
wants some privacy.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.762
So let's make like

14:02.925 --> 14:05.762
Tom and Cruise. Heh heh.

14:08.222 --> 14:12.519
So tell me, why

14:08.222 --> 14:12.519
so melancholic, baby?

14:12.560 --> 14:15.647
I can't tell you my problems.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.647
I don't even know you.

14:15.689 --> 14:21.110
Oh. Well, I was born in Chicago

14:15.689 --> 14:21.110
on a cold winter night in 1976.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.779
My mom was in

14:21.152 --> 14:22.779
a great deal of pain

14:22.821 --> 14:23.822
and I was chargin' through--

14:23.863 --> 14:25.657
Okay. Okay.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.200
I'll talk.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.952
I just got

14:27.241 --> 14:29.952
my first pair of glasses.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.079
Oh, well,

14:29.994 --> 14:32.079
welcome to the club.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.832
You know, some people

14:32.121 --> 14:33.832
look far more attractive

14:33.873 --> 14:35.542
with glasses

14:33.873 --> 14:35.542
than without.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.917
Take me, for example.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.839
As good as

14:38.336 --> 14:40.839
I look now..

14:43.132 --> 14:45.926
See how studlier

14:43.132 --> 14:45.926
I become.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.933
Truly amazing.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.812
But if I wear these

14:52.975 --> 14:55.812
to school..

14:57.438 --> 14:59.649
...all the kids

14:57.438 --> 14:59.649
are going to tease me.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.235
Oh, sure,

14:59.691 --> 15:02.235
in a class of 30

15:02.276 --> 15:04.612
you may have 15 or 20

15:02.276 --> 15:04.612
misguided souls

15:04.654 --> 15:06.781
that may say

15:04.654 --> 15:06.781
"hey, four eyes,"

15:06.823 --> 15:10.993
or "yo, coke bottles"

15:06.823 --> 15:10.993
or<i> "que pasa,</i> window face?"

15:11.035 --> 15:13.496
But that won't

15:11.035 --> 15:13.496
bother you, will it?

15:13.538 --> 15:15.456
Window face?

15:15.498 --> 15:16.875
The trick is to make them laugh

15:16.916 --> 15:18.959
with you before

15:16.916 --> 15:18.959
they laugh at you.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.254
And always remember,

15:19.001 --> 15:21.254
hold your head up high.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.506
Otherwise, those suckers

15:21.295 --> 15:23.506
will slide right off your nose.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.674
[chuckles]

15:24.716 --> 15:26.467
[grunts]

15:29.970 --> 15:32.181
- Hi, buddy.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.181
- Hey.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.225
What do you say,

15:32.223 --> 15:34.225
you and I spend a little more

15:34.267 --> 15:36.394
quality time together, huh?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.689
Let's go out and

15:36.436 --> 15:39.689
clean some grout, shall we?

15:39.731 --> 15:41.315
Jess, I know you're

15:39.731 --> 15:41.315
just being nice to me

15:41.357 --> 15:43.984
because you didn't

15:41.357 --> 15:43.984
make me you're best man.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.278
You're right.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.655
I don't even know

15:45.319 --> 15:47.655
what grout is.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.156
Listen, this thing has been

15:47.697 --> 15:49.156
bugging me all night

15:49.198 --> 15:51.785
and I-I think I made

15:49.198 --> 15:51.785
the wrong choice.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.077
Joseph!

15:53.119 --> 15:55.329
Wait a minute, Jess,

15:53.119 --> 15:55.329
what are you doing?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.623
I'll take care

15:55.371 --> 15:56.623
of this right now.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.499
Hey, what's up, Jess?

15:58.541 --> 16:01.711
Joey, I'm sorry but I think

15:58.541 --> 16:01.711
I may have made a mistake

16:01.753 --> 16:03.588
when I picked you

16:01.753 --> 16:03.588
for best man.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.717
Look, if I did anything to

16:03.630 --> 16:07.717
disgrace my position, I'm sorry.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.720
Just please don't

16:07.759 --> 16:10.720
make me head usher.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.013
Ah, let me finish.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.013
Let me finish.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.474
What I mean to say is,

16:13.055 --> 16:14.474
I don't think

16:14.515 --> 16:16.935
I should have just

16:14.515 --> 16:16.935
picked just you.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.313
I'm gonna have two best friends,

16:16.976 --> 16:20.313
so I pick both of you.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.356
You can't have

16:20.354 --> 16:22.356
two best mans.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.650
Yeah, you're

16:22.398 --> 16:23.650
breaking tradition

16:23.691 --> 16:25.735
and it's bad grammar.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.112
A-ah, since when do

16:25.777 --> 16:28.112
I care about tradition?

16:28.154 --> 16:29.656
You're looking at a guy

16:28.154 --> 16:29.656
who didn't wear that

16:29.697 --> 16:31.407
cardboard hat

16:29.697 --> 16:31.407
at his graduation

16:31.449 --> 16:33.242
because I was afraid

16:31.449 --> 16:33.242
it would ruin my coif.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.997
Hey, look, the two

16:34.661 --> 16:37.997
best men thing is okay with me

16:38.038 --> 16:39.666
if it's okay with Danny.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.126
Anything's better

16:39.707 --> 16:42.126
than being head usher.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.964
Aw, thank you, my boys,

16:42.168 --> 16:45.964
my boys, alright.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.678
Okay, class, take out

16:49.634 --> 16:51.678
your library books

16:51.719 --> 16:53.972
for silent reading time.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.979
Stephanie?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.272
Yes, Miss Claire?

17:03.314 --> 17:04.691
Your dad called me

17:03.314 --> 17:04.691
this morning.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.860
He told me he got

17:04.732 --> 17:06.860
you new reading glasses.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.278
Yeah, I have them

17:06.901 --> 17:09.278
right here.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.573
Since we're reading, maybe it'd

17:09.320 --> 17:12.573
be a good time to try them on.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.326
Maybe it would.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.291
Hey, Steph, you got glasses?

17:19.455 --> 17:22.291
Let's see.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.251

17:24.293 --> 17:25.712
The trick is to make

17:24.293 --> 17:25.712
them laugh with you

17:25.753 --> 17:28.130
before they laugh

17:25.753 --> 17:28.130
at you.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.804
Let's see

17:32.426 --> 17:34.804
your new glasses.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.430
Here they are.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.644
My glasses fit great

17:38.725 --> 17:41.644
but my eyeballs are loose.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.479
[screaming]

17:44.647 --> 17:46.649
I'm just kidding.

17:46.691 --> 17:50.028
Those weren't

17:46.691 --> 17:50.028
my real glasses.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.279
These are.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.114
[kids laughing]

17:54.156 --> 17:56.200
Oh, no. My head shrunk.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.660
A-ah!

17:57.702 --> 18:00.747
Stephanie, could I please

17:57.702 --> 18:00.747
see you at my desk?

18:00.788 --> 18:04.042
- Ooh.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.502
Now, you kids

18:04.083 --> 18:06.502
behave yourselves.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.338
I've got eyes in

18:06.544 --> 18:09.338

18:10.840 --> 18:12.008
Stephanie.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.682
Alright, a nickel.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.897
Alright, a cheeto.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.192
[instrumental music]

18:30.234 --> 18:33.237
Ice cream man.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.237
Ice cream man. Ice cream man.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.492
Wait for me.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.492
I got money.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.207
Give me back

18:42.956 --> 18:45.207
my money, you pig.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.501
[clinking]

18:50.797 --> 18:52.298
Michelle, what's wrong?

18:52.339 --> 18:55.259
I need ice cream.

18:52.339 --> 18:55.259
Rip its head off.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.136
Michelle, get a grip.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.679
The whole point of a piggy bank

18:58.721 --> 19:01.099
is to save your money

18:58.721 --> 19:01.099
for something very important.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.935
Ice cream

19:01.140 --> 19:03.935
is very important.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.733
Sorry, Michelle.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.733
The ice cream man is gone.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.694
He's really gone?

19:18.074 --> 19:19.784
Put the lip away.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.911
It just so happens that

19:19.826 --> 19:21.911
there are a box of fudgesicles

19:21.953 --> 19:24.246
hidden in the back

19:21.953 --> 19:24.246
of the freezer.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.791
But it's not the same.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.543
Hey, did I just hear

19:28.001 --> 19:29.543
the ice cream man?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.087
You just missed him,

19:29.585 --> 19:31.087
but follow me.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.923
There are fudgesicles

19:31.129 --> 19:33.923
in the freezer.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.342
But it's not the same.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.058
Hey, Steph,

19:42.849 --> 19:44.058
what are you working on?

19:44.100 --> 19:46.435
Oh, just

19:44.100 --> 19:46.435

Ohh.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.272

19:50.314 --> 19:52.650
I will not disrupt

19:50.314 --> 19:52.650
the class."

19:52.692 --> 19:55.444
Did you by any chance

19:52.692 --> 19:55.444
disrupt the class today?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.781
Yeah, I snuck

19:56.529 --> 19:58.781
into your joke bag

19:58.823 --> 20:01.367
and borrowed all

19:58.823 --> 20:01.367
your funny glasses.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.619
[sighs]

20:01.408 --> 20:03.619
The teacher put

20:01.408 --> 20:03.619
them in her desk.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.705
But you can have them back

20:03.661 --> 20:05.705
at the end of the year.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.501
Steph, that's not like you

20:07.123 --> 20:10.501
to act up in class.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.004
I know, but I had

20:10.543 --> 20:13.004
to make them laugh with me

20:13.046 --> 20:15.923
before they could

20:13.046 --> 20:15.923
laugh at me.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.843
Oh, I get it.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.843
The class clown routine.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.721
Yeah, I did that once.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.721
Except I was the chubby kid.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.892
They used to call me walrus.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.892
So I would go..

20:25.933 --> 20:28.019
[squealing]

20:29.311 --> 20:32.065
Yeah, kids can be

20:29.311 --> 20:32.065
pretty cruel sometimes.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.566
What did they say

20:32.106 --> 20:33.566
to you?

20:33.607 --> 20:34.650
Well, this one kid said

20:34.692 --> 20:37.195
"You got glasses?

20:34.692 --> 20:37.195
Let me see."

20:39.155 --> 20:40.531
That was it?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.825
Well, he said it

20:40.573 --> 20:42.825
pretty loud.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.663
So then none of the kids

20:44.827 --> 20:47.663
actually teased you?

20:47.705 --> 20:49.415
No, but they would have.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.376
Well, Steph, anybody who

20:49.456 --> 20:52.376
would tease you is a jerk.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.128
Because with or without

20:52.418 --> 20:54.128
your glasses

20:54.170 --> 20:57.506
you're the most

20:54.170 --> 20:57.506
beautiful third grader I know.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.050
And I want you to take

20:57.548 --> 20:59.050
a look at yourself

20:59.092 --> 21:01.010
in the mirror

20:59.092 --> 21:01.010
with those glasses on.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.387
And you'll see that

21:01.052 --> 21:03.387
you look just fine.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.680
I already have.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.183
Trust me, it was

21:04.722 --> 21:07.183
not a pretty sight.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.229
Well, that's because you saw

21:09.018 --> 21:11.229
what you're afraid of

21:11.270 --> 21:13.731
rather than

21:11.270 --> 21:13.731
what was really there.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.568
Now get over to that mirror,

21:13.773 --> 21:17.568
and tell me what you really see.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.196
- Okay.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.196
- Come on.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.328
Now, what do you see?

21:31.290 --> 21:35.128
Hey...it's me.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.046
No, it's the new,

21:35.169 --> 21:37.046

21:37.088 --> 21:39.257
Because now you can read.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.842
Thanks, Joey.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.842
I feel better.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.638
You know, I think

21:44.011 --> 21:45.638
you look pretty mature.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.181
- Really?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.181
- Uh-hmm.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.975
Do you think I could pass

21:47.223 --> 21:48.975
for a fourth grader?

21:49.016 --> 21:51.185
Well, why don't you put the stem

21:49.016 --> 21:51.185
of your glasses in your mouth
