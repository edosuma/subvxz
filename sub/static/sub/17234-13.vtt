00:04.810 --> 00:06.023
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:06.024 --> 00:08.810
If anybody knows your dad's
dirty little secrets, it's you.

00:08.823 --> 00:10.224
I know who ordered the hit.

00:10.292 --> 00:11.526
It was Lamar Wyatt.

00:11.593 --> 00:13.594
Welcome to Belcourt Records, Deacon.

00:13.662 --> 00:15.596
You got so much talent,
but it takes more than that.

00:15.664 --> 00:16.697
You got to want this.

00:16.765 --> 00:17.965
There is no God.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.900
I did not say that!

00:19.968 --> 00:22.069
- Hey. What's going on?
- The show got canceled.

00:22.136 --> 00:23.470
You're gonna publicly beg for forgiveness.

00:23.538 --> 00:24.872
I'm not gonna lie.

00:24.940 --> 00:25.806
You are a lie.

00:25.874 --> 00:27.140
I made my decision.

00:27.208 --> 00:28.375
I'm gonna need you to write a song with me.

00:35.716 --> 00:37.717
What are you doing with a guitar strapped to you?

00:37.785 --> 00:39.086
You're clearly a drummer.

00:39.153 --> 00:41.754
Well, you can't serenade
the ladies with the drums.

00:41.822 --> 00:44.023
Oh, I don't know about that.

00:44.092 --> 00:45.425
Mm.

00:48.161 --> 00:48.995
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:49.063 --> 00:50.129
Thanks for coming.

00:50.197 --> 00:51.330
Hey. Luke Wheeler. How you doing?

00:51.398 --> 00:52.665
Hey. I'm Liam.

00:52.733 --> 00:54.000
Congrats on "Ball and Chain."

00:54.068 --> 00:55.234
- It's good.
- Oh, thank you.

00:55.302 --> 00:56.535
Apparently, I'm not the only guy

00:56.604 --> 00:57.870
that this woman can make beautiful music with.

00:57.938 --> 00:59.338
I guess not.

00:59.406 --> 01:01.107
Well, I love what you did on Rayna's album,

01:01.174 --> 01:03.242
and I'm looking forward to seeing
what you're gonna do with Scarlett.

01:03.310 --> 01:04.610
Trust me... you're gonna love her.

01:04.677 --> 01:05.844
I mean, she is a sweetheart

01:05.912 --> 01:07.246
and the best voice to come out of Nashville

01:07.314 --> 01:08.447
since this one right here.

01:11.618 --> 01:14.153
I, uh, I... I finished the mix of "This Time."

01:14.221 --> 01:15.321
You did?

01:15.388 --> 01:16.688
Oh, this is the one you wrote with Deacon.

01:16.756 --> 01:18.824
You're right. This is our single.

01:18.891 --> 01:20.492
You know this means our album's officially done.

01:20.559 --> 01:22.460
- Finally.
- Oh, my...

01:22.528 --> 01:23.929
Now all I have to do is launch it

01:23.997 --> 01:25.931
against every major label in town.

01:25.999 --> 01:27.599
Am I late? Hi. Sorry.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.434
- No, you're good. Right on time. Hey, hon.
- Hey.

01:29.502 --> 01:31.402
Scarlett O'Connor, meet Liam McGuinnis.

01:33.806 --> 01:35.306
Don't let him scare you.

01:35.374 --> 01:38.075
First time I ever met him,
he slammed a door in my face.

01:38.144 --> 01:39.744
Hey, we better get going.
We don't want to be late.

01:39.811 --> 01:41.646
Okay. Y'all have fun.

01:41.713 --> 01:42.647
And you be nice.

01:47.686 --> 01:49.720
You want to make noise in this marketplace?

01:49.788 --> 01:51.189
Yes, I do.

01:51.257 --> 01:54.825
Then put out an album of duets
with all your famous friends.

01:54.893 --> 01:56.193
Come on, man.

01:56.261 --> 01:58.562
You want me to call up everybody I know

01:58.630 --> 01:59.930
and ask them for that kind of favor?

01:59.998 --> 02:01.231
Do you know how much people ask them?

02:01.299 --> 02:03.333
Hey, hey. You're not a beggar in the streets.

02:03.401 --> 02:05.002
You're a legend in this town.

02:05.070 --> 02:08.005
Singing with you would be an honor, not a favor.

02:08.073 --> 02:09.372
Hell, word gets out that you're asking,

02:09.440 --> 02:10.740
you'll turn folks away.

02:10.808 --> 02:12.643
You know, even if that is true, I just...

02:12.710 --> 02:14.578
- Deacon.
- I can't do it, Joey.

02:14.646 --> 02:17.013
It'll get your name out there.
Might even get you on the radio.

02:17.081 --> 02:21.851
Now, do you want to break out or not?

02:23.120 --> 02:24.788
What the hell? You slept here last night?

02:24.855 --> 02:26.389
I thought you were off on the press-tour thing.

02:26.456 --> 02:27.857
Oh, yeah.

02:27.925 --> 02:30.459
All anybody wanted to talk
about was Juliette's scandal.

02:30.527 --> 02:33.563
And, uh, since the next
three venues canceled on us,

02:33.630 --> 02:35.598
ah, they figured just send us home

02:35.666 --> 02:36.766
till they sort it all out.

02:36.834 --> 02:37.734
Well, that sucks.

02:37.802 --> 02:39.769
Yeah.

02:39.837 --> 02:41.404
You think they'll cancel the rest of the tour.

02:41.471 --> 02:43.105
I don't know.

02:43.173 --> 02:45.107
Thought things would've settled down by now.

02:45.175 --> 02:48.043
Just shows you how judgmental everyone can be.

02:48.111 --> 02:49.978
Well, I wouldn't worry about it, okay?

02:50.046 --> 02:52.147
You are the future of Edgehill, remember?

02:52.216 --> 02:53.482
They're not gonna keep

02:53.550 --> 02:54.883
their best-looking cowboy
on the sidelines for long.

02:56.086 --> 02:57.320
Yeah.

02:57.387 --> 02:58.887
Good morning.

02:58.955 --> 03:00.555
Oh. There she is.

03:00.623 --> 03:02.157
Hey. Gunnar, you remember Layla?

03:02.225 --> 03:03.658
Uh, yeah, I... I do. Hey.

03:03.727 --> 03:05.260
Congratulations on "Ball and Chain."

03:05.328 --> 03:06.494
I've been going on and on to will

03:06.562 --> 03:07.763
about what an amazing songwriter you are.

03:07.831 --> 03:09.031
Uh, I hope you don't mind...

03:09.099 --> 03:10.398
I told her she could stay with us

03:10.466 --> 03:12.167
till we sort things out on the tour.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.268
Isn't he just the best boyfriend?

03:13.336 --> 03:14.737
Yeah, he is.

03:14.804 --> 03:17.405
Hey, you know, I've been
wanting to get into songwriting,

03:17.473 --> 03:19.374
and since you and I are gonna be
spending so much time together,

03:19.442 --> 03:21.643
maybe you and I could try writing sometime.

03:21.711 --> 03:24.011
Well, I mean, I'm... I been kind of busy lately.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.247
A lot of people calling and...

03:25.314 --> 03:26.648
Well, of course.

03:26.716 --> 03:28.450
I mean, I'll totally work around your schedule.

03:28.517 --> 03:31.419
Come on, man... you got to
have a little bit of time...

03:31.487 --> 03:32.987
for my girl.

03:33.055 --> 03:34.588
Yeah, sure.

03:34.656 --> 03:36.457
Awesome! Great! Well, thank you. Thank you.

03:36.524 --> 03:39.260
You know, whenever you want,
you, uh, you just let me know.

03:39.327 --> 03:41.428
All right.

03:45.134 --> 03:47.201
"Crazy Tonight" got the
biggest response on the tour,

03:47.269 --> 03:49.069
so I thought that might be the single,

03:49.137 --> 03:51.405
but I did this song called
"Looking for a place to shine"

03:51.473 --> 03:53.574
at the Opry the first time I played there,

03:53.642 --> 03:55.476
and, um, that was pretty special,

03:55.543 --> 03:57.077
so I don't know which way to go on it.

03:57.145 --> 03:58.579
Where are you from?

03:58.647 --> 04:02.015
Uh... Natchez, Mississippi.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.950
How'd you end up here? In Nashville?

04:04.018 --> 04:06.319
Yeah, that's... that's where we are, right?

04:06.387 --> 04:07.654
Yeah. Sorry.

04:07.721 --> 04:11.724
Uh, I... moved here, uh, with my... a friend.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.326
Ah. You followed a boy.

04:14.695 --> 04:16.062
Thought you wanted to talk about music.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.064
Yeah, I do. Tell me about the boy.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.166
I don't really...

04:20.233 --> 04:22.335
want to talk about... him.

04:22.403 --> 04:25.137
Sure.

04:25.205 --> 04:27.173
Bring the charts tomorrow.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.641
We'll lay something down.

04:28.709 --> 04:30.376
Which song?

04:32.012 --> 04:34.180
Surprise me.

04:34.247 --> 04:35.715
All right, keep 'em closed. Keep 'em closed.

04:35.783 --> 04:36.849
Just a little ways more.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.684
Where are you taking me?

04:38.751 --> 04:43.388
Well, I have been thinking about
that whole marketing thing...

04:43.456 --> 04:45.724
how you've been looking for something big

04:45.792 --> 04:48.427
to, you know, let 'em know Rayna Jaymes is back.

04:48.494 --> 04:50.062
What on earth?

04:50.130 --> 04:51.630
Well, see for yourself.

04:51.698 --> 04:54.300
What?!

04:54.367 --> 04:55.500
I'm part-owner of the team.

04:55.568 --> 04:56.835
I got the other partners to agree

04:56.902 --> 04:58.403
to race her in Atlanta this weekend.

04:58.471 --> 04:59.738
- No!
- Yeah... look, look.

04:59.806 --> 05:00.839
You did not!

05:00.906 --> 05:02.974
Millions of people watching on TV,

05:03.042 --> 05:04.843
tons of press coverage,

05:04.910 --> 05:06.778
and I am giving a private concert

05:06.846 --> 05:08.313
to the sponsors after the race.

05:08.381 --> 05:10.515
You should join me on the stage
and announce the drop date.

05:10.583 --> 05:12.683
You are too much!

05:14.186 --> 05:16.020
Oh. Anything for you.

05:17.389 --> 05:20.091
Thanks, y'all. That is amazing.

05:20.159 --> 05:21.692
That Sam Boone over there?

05:21.760 --> 05:23.161
Yeah, Boone's superstores

05:23.229 --> 05:24.762
is one of the sponsors of the race.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.764
That's almost as exciting to me as that car is.

05:26.832 --> 05:27.965
Well, get over there and talk to him.

05:28.032 --> 05:29.166
All right, I'm going to.

05:29.234 --> 05:31.001
All right.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.503
Hey.

05:32.571 --> 05:34.037
Mr. Boone, I'm Rayna Jaymes.

05:34.105 --> 05:35.773
You don't have to tell me who you are, Ms. Jaymes.

05:35.841 --> 05:37.341
I'm a huge fan.

05:37.409 --> 05:38.843
Thank you. The feeling is mutual.

05:38.910 --> 05:41.078
I tell you what... I started
a small business recently.

05:41.145 --> 05:42.847
The first thing I did was read your book.

05:42.914 --> 05:44.314
- That so?
- I was so inspired.

05:44.382 --> 05:46.950
There you were... you took
a tiny storefront in Oklahoma,

05:47.018 --> 05:48.585
turned it into an empire.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.287
I have a lot I could learn from you.

05:50.355 --> 05:54.157
I doubt that, but I'd be happy
to share any expertise I have.

05:54.225 --> 05:56.693
I would seriously love that.

05:56.761 --> 05:58.661
In fact...

05:58.729 --> 06:01.898
would you like to be my guest
tomorrow night at the Opry?

06:01.965 --> 06:04.300
I could show you around. We could chat.

06:04.368 --> 06:07.236
Only if you agree to be my
guest at the race on Sunday.

06:07.304 --> 06:08.571
You have yourself a deal.

06:08.639 --> 06:10.373
I'm so looking forward to it.

06:10.441 --> 06:13.109
Great to meet you. Gonna go back to my car now.

06:13.176 --> 06:15.645
What, all this horsepower,
and I'm getting upstaged

06:15.713 --> 06:17.914
by a 70-year-old man wearing suspenders?

06:17.981 --> 06:19.348
Boone's is basically the only place

06:19.416 --> 06:21.617
you can still buy CDs these days.

06:21.684 --> 06:22.885
Let's not forget...

06:22.953 --> 06:24.954
I don't have a big corporation behind me anymore.

06:25.022 --> 06:26.255
Got to figure out how I'm gonna get

06:26.323 --> 06:28.124
my own damn album on the shelves.

06:28.191 --> 06:32.361
Mm. You are so sexy when you
start talking distribution.

06:32.429 --> 06:33.862
I just want you all to know

06:33.930 --> 06:37.365
how truly sorry I am for my recent behavior.

06:37.434 --> 06:39.435
Honestly, since my mother's death,

06:39.502 --> 06:43.138
I've been a little lost,
made some pretty big mistakes,

06:43.205 --> 06:45.674
and you all have every right to be upset with me.

06:45.742 --> 06:48.076
But I promise you right here and now

06:48.144 --> 06:50.211
I'm gonna do everything in my power

06:50.279 --> 06:52.047
to get my life back on track.

06:52.114 --> 06:53.348
Forgive me.

06:53.416 --> 06:55.550
And then you want to launch into "Dreams."

06:55.617 --> 06:57.152
They can take the cue off "Forgive Me."

06:57.219 --> 06:59.287
Uh, you should, uh, give them a nod or something.

06:59.355 --> 07:00.721
Otherwise, it seems too pre-rehearsed.

07:00.789 --> 07:01.722
Okay.

07:10.231 --> 07:13.568
At last... the filly is broken.

07:21.076 --> 07:25.463
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:33.598 --> 07:34.932
Hey. Thanks for coming in,
Dash. I really appreciate it.

07:34.999 --> 07:37.101
I... I... I know you must
be busy with Lamar's trial.

07:37.168 --> 07:38.635
Go ahead... take a seat.

07:38.703 --> 07:40.738
I'm, uh, glad you called.

07:40.805 --> 07:44.474
I just wanted to say how sorry I am about Peggy.

07:44.542 --> 07:45.842
Thank you.

07:45.909 --> 07:48.044
That... that's actually why
I... I wanted to meet with you.

07:48.112 --> 07:51.180
You see, I... I'm convinced that Lamar Wyatt

07:51.249 --> 07:52.449
was responsible for the shooting.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.251
You have any proof?

07:54.318 --> 07:55.585
No, but it makes perfect sense.

07:55.653 --> 07:56.853
I mean, he thought that I was your star witness,

07:56.920 --> 07:59.122
but you and I both know I'm not.

08:00.491 --> 08:01.657
Tandy is.

08:03.293 --> 08:06.262
You know I can't discuss the details of my case.

08:06.329 --> 08:09.431
You always were a lousy poker player, dash.

08:09.499 --> 08:11.367
Look, it had to be somebody close to Lamar,

08:11.434 --> 08:13.903
somebody high up in the business
who knew the intimate details.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.939
The... whoever the witness
is, you should be grateful

08:17.007 --> 08:20.643
that they had the guts to stand up to Lamar...

08:20.710 --> 08:24.146
especially since your theory has zero proof.

08:25.915 --> 08:28.083
I really am sorry about Peggy,

08:28.151 --> 08:30.118
but you can take solace in the fact

08:30.186 --> 08:33.688
that Lamar is going to jail for something.

08:35.957 --> 08:37.457
Well, I hear you've been spending some time

08:37.525 --> 08:38.927
with Luke Wheeler, huh?

08:38.995 --> 08:40.861
So, what do you think? Do you like him?

08:40.929 --> 08:41.996
Yeah, he's so nice.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.398
He has, like, a thousand horses,

08:43.465 --> 08:44.933
and he said we can go
maybe, like, riding sometime.

08:45.001 --> 08:46.067
Hey!

08:46.135 --> 08:47.302
Come home already.

08:47.369 --> 08:48.469
I miss you.

08:48.537 --> 08:50.838
Oh, sweetie, I miss you, too.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.308
I... I will. I promise I'll be home soon.

08:53.375 --> 08:54.375
Here's mom.

08:54.443 --> 08:55.543
Thank you.

08:55.611 --> 08:57.211
Hi.

08:57.279 --> 08:59.146
Trying to figure out what I'm gonna wear tonight.

08:59.214 --> 09:01.081
Who are you dressing for?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.283
Juliette or for Luke?

09:02.351 --> 09:04.151
I mean, it is Juliette's induction, but...

09:04.219 --> 09:06.187
it's the big night.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.688
Luke and I are making

09:07.755 --> 09:10.024
our first appearance in
front of the press together.

09:10.091 --> 09:10.891
How you feeling?

09:10.959 --> 09:12.026
I feel good.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.427
You know...

09:13.494 --> 09:14.995
it's a little daunting,

09:15.063 --> 09:16.897
But I'm ready to make this commitment, so...

09:16.965 --> 09:18.299
Oh, hey, you know what?

09:18.366 --> 09:20.267
It's time for my mud bath.

09:20.335 --> 09:22.803
I'm just having the best time here up in Napa.

09:22.871 --> 09:24.971
Ohh! You're killing me with that!

09:25.039 --> 09:26.506
All right, well, have fun,

09:26.574 --> 09:28.408
and we miss you and we love you.

09:28.476 --> 09:29.476
I love you.

09:29.544 --> 09:30.910
Bye.

09:31.879 --> 09:34.680
____

09:47.461 --> 09:49.229
Have you ever written before?

09:49.296 --> 09:50.730
No, but I know how important it is

09:50.797 --> 09:52.298
if you want to be taken seriously in this town,

09:52.366 --> 09:54.767
so I'm all yours.

09:54.835 --> 09:56.435
Uh, do you have something on your mind

09:56.503 --> 09:57.870
you want to write about?

09:57.937 --> 09:59.405
Oh.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.507
No, not... not particularly.

10:01.575 --> 10:04.577
You know, I figured that we'd
come up with something together.

10:04.644 --> 10:07.246
Okay. Uh, usually, one
person gets the ball rolling.

10:07.313 --> 10:09.715
So I... I thought since it's your song...

10:09.783 --> 10:11.116
Right. Yeah.

10:11.184 --> 10:13.352
Well, um, most of my fans are young.

10:13.419 --> 10:15.620
So, you know, maybe something, like, upbeat.

10:15.688 --> 10:16.922
- Um...
- What... no, no.

10:16.990 --> 10:18.190
Uh, let's start with what you want to say.

10:18.258 --> 10:19.758
So, what's on your mind?

10:19.825 --> 10:21.793
I want to write something fun.

10:21.861 --> 10:24.729
Yeah, but, you see, it still
has to come from someplace.

10:24.797 --> 10:27.432
Take Taylor Swift... she has a bunch of fun songs,

10:27.500 --> 10:30.034
but they're usually about personal experiences.

10:30.102 --> 10:31.936
Yes, well, not everyone's love life

10:32.004 --> 10:34.138
is as, you know, dramatic as hers, so...

10:34.206 --> 10:36.007
I have one boyfriend, and he's awesome.

10:36.074 --> 10:38.009
Yeah, but "I have one boyfriend, he's awesome"...

10:38.076 --> 10:39.611
that's... that's not a great song.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.780
Wow. You don't have to be such a jerk.

10:41.847 --> 10:44.181
Oh. I'm I'm... I'm not.

10:44.249 --> 10:46.850
Being a songwriter, you don't just do it for fun.

10:46.919 --> 10:49.120
You do it 'cause you have
something you want to say.

10:49.187 --> 10:51.722
I... I... I think this was a mistake.

10:51.790 --> 10:52.656
Wait... seriously?

10:52.724 --> 10:53.757
I'm just gonna go.

10:53.825 --> 10:55.159
Uh...

10:55.227 --> 10:56.527
Okay.

11:00.165 --> 11:01.632
You don't belong here!

11:06.538 --> 11:09.005
Where did you take Rayna on your first date?

11:09.073 --> 11:12.375
Well, you know, it's funny...
I think this is our first date.

11:12.444 --> 11:13.710
How'd you all meet?

11:13.778 --> 11:15.779
We just kinda kept bumping into each other,

11:15.847 --> 11:17.781
and... and then we did the song and then...

11:17.849 --> 11:19.316
So, how's it going so far?

11:19.383 --> 11:20.883
You think I'll get a second date?

11:20.952 --> 11:22.852
Rayna, your father's trial starts on Monday.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.587
How are you feeling?

11:24.655 --> 11:27.424
Well, I think we're here
tonight to celebrate the Opry

11:27.491 --> 11:29.525
and welcome Juliette into the family,

11:29.593 --> 11:30.726
so we'll keep it to that tonight.

11:30.794 --> 11:32.128
Do you have any comment about the trial?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.130
Hello, hello.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.264
Hey.

11:38.332 --> 11:40.299
Hey.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.201
I was hoping I'd see you here.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.436
Are you kidding me?

11:43.504 --> 11:44.938
No Megan tonight?

11:45.006 --> 11:46.673
No, she's got this big, important case

11:46.741 --> 11:48.041
that's taking over our lives.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.610
But, uh, I wouldn't miss this for the world.

11:50.678 --> 11:51.811
Congratulations.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.312
Thank you... for everything.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.449
You've always been in my
corner, and I appreciate it.

11:56.517 --> 11:58.584
You got a lot of people in your corner.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.885
Is there even an audience out there?

11:59.953 --> 12:01.654
Come on, now. You know how many people love you.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.657
That's actually partially
why I'm here... to ask you...

12:06.927 --> 12:09.728
would you sing a duet with me on my new album?

12:09.796 --> 12:11.063
You're recording an album?

12:11.130 --> 12:12.731
It is ridiculous. I understand that.

12:12.799 --> 12:15.267
But I got signed with Belcourt Records.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.469
What are you talking about? That's amazing.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.671
Congratulations.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.673
Thank you for not laughing your ass off.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.774
Does that mean you'll do it?

12:21.841 --> 12:23.508
Uh...

12:23.577 --> 12:26.378
folks tend to burn the things that I sing on.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.813
So I'm gonna do you a favor and say no.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.115
You know I don't care about that crap.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.550
And that's why I love you.

12:32.651 --> 12:33.785
Hold on.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.124
Congratulations!

12:39.192 --> 12:40.792
Thank you!

12:40.859 --> 12:42.060
Deacon! Hey!

12:45.831 --> 12:47.932
It's okay. Juliette knows you're my dad.

12:49.434 --> 12:52.036
Then it's not awkward, at all.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.072
Mom, can we please go find Brad?

12:54.139 --> 12:55.707
Well, I'm waiting here to meet Mr. Boone,

12:55.774 --> 12:57.441
so I can't go right this second.

12:57.509 --> 12:58.809
Well, Luke will come with me.

12:58.876 --> 12:59.910
Won't you, Luke?

12:59.978 --> 13:01.412
I suppose I could help track him down.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.347
Yes! Come on.  Thank you.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.249
Mr. Boone!

13:05.317 --> 13:07.351
Welcome. Welcome to my second home.

13:07.419 --> 13:08.619
Thank you, Ms. Jaymes.

13:08.686 --> 13:10.020
Oh, please call me "Rayna."

13:10.088 --> 13:11.922
Come back here. I got some
friends I want you to meet.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.757
I bet this is gonna be you one day...

13:14.993 --> 13:16.927
Being inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.

13:16.995 --> 13:17.995
You really think so?

13:18.062 --> 13:19.596
You kidding? I've heard you sing.

13:19.664 --> 13:21.464
Not to mention you're the daughter

13:21.532 --> 13:23.399
of Rayna Jaymes and Deacon Claybourne,

13:23.467 --> 13:26.036
which pretty much makes you country royalty.

13:27.505 --> 13:31.741
You know, it's not fair what
people are saying about you.

13:31.808 --> 13:34.544
They're just bullies, and bullies should not win.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.681
Hi. You about ready?

13:38.749 --> 13:40.983
Yeah. I'm just gonna get changed.

13:41.051 --> 13:43.019
All right, well, I should let you get ready.

13:43.086 --> 13:44.287
I'll see you out there.

13:44.355 --> 13:45.221
I wouldn't miss it.

13:51.762 --> 13:53.796
You know, you don't have to do this.

13:56.199 --> 13:57.767
Yes, I do.

13:57.834 --> 14:02.004
♪ I'm gonna go crazy if I
don't get crazy tonight ♪

14:04.774 --> 14:06.642
♪ I'm talkin' whiskey
slammin', dirty dancin' ♪

14:06.709 --> 14:08.610
♪ romancin' come daylight ♪

14:11.481 --> 14:14.082
♪ no matter what you were
thinkin' that I wouldn't ♪

14:14.150 --> 14:16.451
- ♪ honey, I just might ♪
- Stop! Guys! Stop!

14:16.519 --> 14:18.453
Are you serious? You want me to produce this?

14:19.389 --> 14:20.755
I'm sorry, guys. Get out.

14:20.823 --> 14:22.857
Not you. You stay.

14:22.925 --> 14:24.292
"Whiskey slammin', dirty dancin'"?

14:24.359 --> 14:25.694
What the hell's this song about?

14:25.761 --> 14:27.162
'Cause I highly doubt that you're

14:27.229 --> 14:29.064
the whiskey-slammin',
dirty-dancin' type of girl.

14:29.131 --> 14:30.364
I'm not. I just...

14:30.432 --> 14:32.333
Is it a song about who you wish you were

14:32.401 --> 14:33.534
- No.
- Or who you want to be?

14:33.602 --> 14:35.203
It's just a song that makes people happy.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.037
That's your answer?

14:37.472 --> 14:39.773
Well, thank you. Um, we're done.

14:39.841 --> 14:41.742
What do you want from me?

14:41.810 --> 14:43.043
Well, I want to know you.

14:43.111 --> 14:44.778
How am I supposed to produce an album

14:44.846 --> 14:46.113
that introduces you to the world

14:46.181 --> 14:47.748
if I have no idea who you are?

14:51.620 --> 14:53.987
It's okay. I'll, uh... I'll figure it out.

14:54.055 --> 14:55.488
What are you doing?! No, no, no!

14:55.556 --> 14:56.757
That's private! You can't have that!

14:56.825 --> 14:58.692
Give it back! You can't read that!

14:58.760 --> 15:00.360
It's mine! You son of a...

15:09.453 --> 15:11.287
Tell me about "Black Roses."

15:11.355 --> 15:13.423
I can't believe Rayna would want
me working with someone like you!

15:13.491 --> 15:15.892
Oh, you mean someone who's actually
willing to tell you the truth?

15:15.959 --> 15:18.061
Someone who doesn't go all mushy

15:18.129 --> 15:19.829
every time you bat your eyelashes?

15:19.897 --> 15:21.498
I'm a real bastard, I know it.

15:21.565 --> 15:23.366
You know, I did a little bit of research on you.

15:23.434 --> 15:25.335
Guess what everyone said.

15:25.403 --> 15:26.669
"She's so nice."

15:26.737 --> 15:28.204
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

15:28.272 --> 15:30.472
Except inside every nice person I ever met,

15:30.541 --> 15:32.909
there's always this angry, damaged soul

15:32.976 --> 15:35.277
that's fighting tooth and
nail to keep that side hidden.

15:35.345 --> 15:36.378
Not me.

15:36.446 --> 15:37.346
Your journal says otherwise.

15:38.549 --> 15:39.916
Tell me about "Black Roses."

15:39.983 --> 15:41.651
Why should I? You already
know everything about me.

15:41.718 --> 15:44.186
Just give it back! Because I
think you're insanely talented.

15:44.254 --> 15:46.688
And I think you're way more
interesting than you let on.

15:46.756 --> 15:49.124
Why would you keep the most
intriguing parts of yourself hidden?

15:49.192 --> 15:50.392
Are you scared?

15:50.460 --> 15:51.760
I... I don't know what you want me to tell you.

15:51.827 --> 15:55.197
I just want the truth.

15:55.265 --> 15:56.665
Do you want to be a singer

15:56.732 --> 15:57.766
or do you want to be an artist?

16:01.671 --> 16:06.708
"I can see your eyes staring
into mine across the battlefield."

16:06.776 --> 16:09.277
Who... whose eyes? Who hurt you?

16:09.344 --> 16:10.311
Was that the boy?

16:12.748 --> 16:14.115
My mother.

16:17.653 --> 16:18.993
Nervous?

16:19.004 --> 16:21.739
Like a long-tailed cat in a
room full of rocking chairs.

16:21.807 --> 16:23.207
You should be.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.676
I mean, it's all downhill from here for you.

16:25.744 --> 16:27.645
This is the highest honor

16:27.712 --> 16:29.780
you're ever gonna receive in your entire career.

16:29.848 --> 16:31.015
Wow. You know what?

16:31.083 --> 16:33.517
No offense, but you kind of suck at pep talks.

16:33.585 --> 16:35.019
Look, all I'm saying is

16:35.087 --> 16:36.219
they're giving you a trophy tonight,

16:36.287 --> 16:37.688
but what you're really getting is a place

16:37.756 --> 16:39.690
where you can come sing
your songs anytime you want.

16:39.758 --> 16:41.459
There's always gonna be an audience here

16:41.526 --> 16:43.594
that's ready to listen and love you.

16:43.662 --> 16:45.663
I'm not so sure about that last part...

16:45.730 --> 16:47.097
least not for me.

16:47.165 --> 16:50.634
Okay, look, I've been misquoted,
misunderstood, lied about

16:50.702 --> 16:52.336
more times than I care to remember.

16:52.403 --> 16:53.503
I'm still here.

16:53.571 --> 16:55.138
So are you.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.508
8 million sold?

16:58.576 --> 16:59.776
That's impressive.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.845
Well, you know, it is such an honor

17:01.912 --> 17:04.013
to be up on this wall with
all these great performers.

17:04.082 --> 17:05.714
Sometimes I still have to pinch myself.

17:05.782 --> 17:07.817
Hey, mom, they're about
to do Juliette's induction,

17:07.885 --> 17:09.117
so can I go in the wings with Maddie?

17:09.185 --> 17:11.621
Mr. Boone, would you like to go watch the show

17:11.689 --> 17:12.755
from the best seats in the house?

17:14.090 --> 17:16.058
You know, I'm not much of a Juliette Barnes fan,

17:16.126 --> 17:17.794
but y'all go ahead.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.597
Well, I don't want to leave
you back here all by yourself.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.898
Um, why don't you go off
with Luke and find Maddie,

17:22.967 --> 17:23.933
and I'll catch up with you, okay?

17:24.001 --> 17:25.101
Okay. Thanks, mom.

17:26.736 --> 17:28.704
Uh, you want to see the Johnny and June exhibit?

17:28.771 --> 17:30.272
Now you're talking.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.308
Those people were country stars.

17:34.244 --> 17:36.145
I'm so thrilled to get to do this

17:36.213 --> 17:38.881
on behalf of the entire Opry family.

17:38.948 --> 17:41.250
We'd like to welcome Juliette Barnes.

17:41.318 --> 17:42.584
Congratulations.

17:42.652 --> 17:45.086
You are the newest member of the Grand Ole Opry.

17:49.392 --> 17:51.326
Good luck.

17:52.862 --> 17:54.162
Thanks, Brad.

17:54.230 --> 17:58.166
I'd like to thank Steve Buchanan and Pete Fisher

17:58.234 --> 18:00.068
and everybody at the Grand Ole Opry.

18:00.136 --> 18:03.071
I am truly, truly honored.

18:03.139 --> 18:06.974
I also wanted to thank my manager, Glenn Goodman,

18:07.043 --> 18:09.511
for sticking by me all these years.

18:09.578 --> 18:11.812
Glenn, you're the closest
thing I've got to family,

18:11.880 --> 18:13.581
and I'm very grateful.

18:13.649 --> 18:16.350
Just read the script already.

18:16.418 --> 18:19.253
And lastly, I'd like to thank all of you out there

18:19.320 --> 18:21.455
who have come to my defense recently.

18:21.523 --> 18:23.157
'Course, that's a short list.

18:23.224 --> 18:25.593
- No. No, no, no.
- People don't seem

18:25.661 --> 18:27.394
to approve much of me lately...

18:27.462 --> 18:29.196
so much so that my label

18:29.264 --> 18:31.465
asked me to come out here and apologize

18:31.533 --> 18:33.400
for pretty much everything I've ever done.

18:33.468 --> 18:35.135
Even wrote me a nice little speech.

18:35.203 --> 18:37.504
- It's right there on the teleprompter.
- What the hell is she doing?

18:37.572 --> 18:39.940
- Whatever she wants.
- But I'll be damned if I stand here

18:40.007 --> 18:42.176
in the mother church of country music

18:42.243 --> 18:44.344
and pretend to be something that I'm not.

18:44.412 --> 18:46.246
So to all of you out there

18:46.314 --> 18:48.281
who want me to beg for forgiveness,

18:48.348 --> 18:52.552
who want to burn my records
and cancel my concerts,

18:52.620 --> 18:55.822
who want to put my career in the ground,

18:55.890 --> 18:57.090

21:24.800 --> 21:27.001
But it sure was brave.

21:27.069 --> 21:28.337
Good for you.

21:44.611 --> 21:45.878
From day one,

21:45.946 --> 21:48.046
I have always had your best interests at heart,

21:48.114 --> 21:50.248
but you fought me.

21:50.316 --> 21:52.684
I used to tell myself, "hey, she's an artist."

21:52.751 --> 21:53.885
It's part of her process."

21:53.953 --> 21:55.587
But now I know the truth.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.255
You're just plain stupid.

21:58.857 --> 22:00.425
We're dropping you.

22:00.493 --> 22:03.061
As of this moment, you are
no longer an Edgehill artist.

22:07.466 --> 22:09.366
Just for the record,

22:09.434 --> 22:12.536
"just plain stupid" is losing
two of your top-grossing artists

22:12.605 --> 22:14.706
in less than six months on the job,

22:14.773 --> 22:17.141
not to mention pinning all your hopes and dreams

22:17.209 --> 22:18.776
on a karaoke singer

22:18.844 --> 22:21.878
who came in second place at a talent show.

22:21.946 --> 22:23.814
I may have just burnt the house down,

22:23.881 --> 22:27.518
but I made damn sure you were
in it when I lit the match.

22:27.586 --> 22:29.786
I'll see you on the unemployment line.

22:39.797 --> 22:41.397
Hey, Scarlett, I'm making breakfast.

22:41.465 --> 22:42.432
You want some?

22:43.334 --> 22:45.135
Making eggs.

22:48.539 --> 22:49.472
Hey, Scarlett?

22:50.642 --> 22:51.474
Hey, Scar...

22:55.646 --> 22:56.613
Hey.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.813
Hey. You all right?

22:57.881 --> 22:59.549
Yeah, I'm still in the studio.

22:59.617 --> 23:00.716
What... have you been working all night?

23:01.758 --> 23:02.858
With Liam?

23:02.926 --> 23:04.026
What... you never got excited

23:04.095 --> 23:05.195
and worked on something all night before?

23:05.262 --> 23:06.696
Well, yeah, but...

23:06.763 --> 23:09.165
Look, you just call me if
you need anything, all right?

23:09.233 --> 23:11.701
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

23:14.605 --> 23:17.073
What about this part here?

23:17.140 --> 23:20.209
"I lay low, lay low, and watch the bridges burn."

23:20.276 --> 23:22.478
She just became too unpredictable.

23:22.545 --> 23:24.013
She'd be up one minute, down the next,

23:24.081 --> 23:25.615
and when I was really little,

23:25.682 --> 23:28.150
I thought that it was my fault...

23:28.218 --> 23:30.252
I was what was making her so sad...

23:30.320 --> 23:34.089
so I would try to be real quiet...

23:34.157 --> 23:35.491
- lay low.
- Yeah.

23:35.558 --> 23:37.226
And that way, I couldn't possibly do anything

23:37.293 --> 23:39.661
that would set her off, but...

23:39.729 --> 23:43.164
then sooner or later, she... got all by herself,

23:43.232 --> 23:48.036
and... she'd get taken away to this, uh...

23:48.104 --> 23:50.338
- I used to call it the horse farm.
- Horse farm?

23:50.405 --> 23:52.841
Yeah, it sounds better than "psychiatric ward."

23:52.908 --> 23:54.743
They had animals that were...

23:54.810 --> 23:56.477
well, therapy animals...

23:56.545 --> 23:58.179
and the horses calmed her down.

24:00.882 --> 24:02.850
What's this?

24:02.917 --> 24:05.119
"I'm not under your spell."

24:06.388 --> 24:09.089
That's me trying to convince myself, I think.

24:09.158 --> 24:11.825
She's my mother. You don't...

24:11.893 --> 24:13.294
you don't leave your mother behind.

24:13.362 --> 24:15.663
I'll always be under her spell.

24:15.730 --> 24:19.733
You think you can get a piano player in here?

24:19.801 --> 24:21.101
Now?

24:21.169 --> 24:24.805
Yeah, I think now's probably best to put it down.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.479
You know, for a mid-packer,

24:32.547 --> 24:35.014
your 53 car is getting a lot of attention.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.650
Well, if you can't be the fastest,

24:36.717 --> 24:38.318
you may as well be the prettiest.

24:38.386 --> 24:39.319
Let me get you a refill, Sam.

24:39.387 --> 24:41.188
- Thank you, sir.
- All right.

24:41.255 --> 24:43.190
- Thank you.
- The yellow flag is out, and we are under caution.

24:43.257 --> 24:44.224
Shall we sit?

24:44.292 --> 24:45.625
Yeah.

24:45.693 --> 24:49.062
Rayna, I got to say... you are a real class act.

24:49.129 --> 24:50.763
- Aww. Thank you.
- You know...

24:50.831 --> 24:52.732
Some of these young country stars

24:52.800 --> 24:54.333
could take a lesson from you.

24:54.401 --> 24:58.104
Can you imagine Loretta Lynn or Barbara Mandrell

24:58.172 --> 24:59.806
making the kind of speech we heard last night?

24:59.873 --> 25:01.040
Well, no, but listen...

25:01.108 --> 25:02.675
as we were discussing,

25:02.743 --> 25:05.411
I would really love to talk
to you about my new label.

25:05.478 --> 25:08.647
Becoming independent has not
been without its challenges,

25:08.715 --> 25:10.616
and I do have this new album coming out.

25:10.684 --> 25:13.051
Rayna, I think I know what you're after,

25:13.119 --> 25:14.453
so let's stop dancing around.

25:14.521 --> 25:16.288
You want shelf space, am I right?

25:16.356 --> 25:18.957
You are right. I would love to make a deal.

25:19.025 --> 25:23.561
Rule number 3... don't mix business with pleasure.

25:23.629 --> 25:27.265
But let me introduce you to Dan Gillis.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.935
He's the V.P. that handles that department.

25:30.002 --> 25:31.937
From what I hear, they almost always

25:32.004 --> 25:33.571
have more product than shelf space.

25:33.639 --> 25:35.741
That's why they normally make their deals

25:35.808 --> 25:37.209
at least a year in advance.

25:37.276 --> 25:38.710
Talk to Dan.

25:38.777 --> 25:41.613
Maybe y'all can work something out for next year.

25:45.884 --> 25:47.151
Hey.

25:47.219 --> 25:48.253
Hey.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.820
What happened with Layla?

25:49.888 --> 25:51.522
I have no idea. Why don't you ask her?

25:51.590 --> 25:53.391
I did. She said you humiliated her.

25:53.459 --> 25:54.592
That is not true.

25:54.660 --> 25:56.593
I just tried to... to peel back some layers.

25:56.661 --> 25:58.395
And guess what... there are no layers.

25:58.463 --> 25:59.563
Don't you think that's a little harsh?

25:59.631 --> 26:00.831
What are you doing?

26:00.899 --> 26:02.233
What do you mean, what am I doing?

26:02.300 --> 26:04.168
- What are you doing with her?

26:04.236 --> 26:06.237
Uh, look, I know you're not
the biggest fan of Layla's,

26:06.304 --> 26:07.738
but you're gonna have to get used to it.

26:07.806 --> 26:08.939
She's my girlfriend.

26:09.007 --> 26:11.041
Dude, you are not attracted to her.

26:12.343 --> 26:13.410
Forget it.

26:13.478 --> 26:14.878
No.

26:14.945 --> 26:17.347
No, I won't forget it,
because this is the same crap

26:17.415 --> 26:18.715
that put you on those train tracks.

26:20.251 --> 26:21.718
It's complicated.

26:21.786 --> 26:23.219
Yeah, it is complicated.

26:23.288 --> 26:26.490
So go uncomplicate it before somebody gets hurt.

26:31.061 --> 26:33.129
Even if Lamar could have
arranged the hit from prison,

26:33.197 --> 26:34.164
what's his motive?

26:36.400 --> 26:38.134
Is our conversation privileged?

26:38.202 --> 26:39.068
Absolutely.

26:41.638 --> 26:45.073
I was under investigation
for defrauding a credit union.

26:45.141 --> 26:46.609
I paid the money back,

26:46.677 --> 26:48.911
but it didn't matter to the feds.

26:48.978 --> 26:52.348
So I exchanged immunity
for information about Lamar.

26:52.416 --> 26:54.283
Wait... you're the secret star witness

26:54.351 --> 26:55.785
- for the prosecution?
- No. No, no.

26:55.852 --> 26:57.920
My information wasn't
valuable enough to convict him,

26:57.987 --> 27:01.190
but I am convinced that he thinks it was me.

27:01.257 --> 27:03.692
So the hit was a case of mistaken identity?

27:03.759 --> 27:04.960
Lamar is the one who put the feds

27:05.028 --> 27:06.195
on my trail from the beginning.

27:06.262 --> 27:07.595
I mean, he knows that I talked to them.

27:07.663 --> 27:09.231
And... and... and the fact that I'm not in jail

27:09.299 --> 27:11.266
practically screams that I cut a deal with them.

27:12.635 --> 27:14.903
Are you talking to anyone?

27:14.971 --> 27:16.371
A grief counselor or a therapist?

27:16.439 --> 27:17.806
Don't even go there.

27:17.873 --> 27:19.173
Listen to me.

27:19.241 --> 27:21.643
Revenge won't bring Peggy back.

27:21.711 --> 27:23.745
You have to deal with your feelings.

27:23.813 --> 27:25.480
I know... it's easier said than done,

27:25.548 --> 27:28.249
but that's why most people need to seek help.

27:28.317 --> 27:31.786
Because of Lamar Wyatt, my wife is dead.

27:31.854 --> 27:34.621
The only thing that is gonna help me is justice.

27:36.358 --> 27:37.691
Got a big treat for ya.

27:37.759 --> 27:39.493
I know y'all been watching her gorgeous face

27:39.561 --> 27:41.095
circling the track all day,

27:41.163 --> 27:43.630
but now it's time for y'all
to meet her in the flesh.

27:43.698 --> 27:45.266
Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines

27:45.334 --> 27:46.868
for Ms. Rayna Jaymes!

27:48.237 --> 27:51.071
I hope this changes your mind about rule number 3.

27:52.206 --> 27:53.206
Hey, everybody.

27:56.210 --> 27:57.745
Thank you to Luke Wheeler

27:57.812 --> 28:00.414
for letting me hijack his
stage here for a quick minute.

28:00.482 --> 28:02.616
I've got some exciting news.

28:02.684 --> 28:05.853
My album is going to drop on May 1st.

28:07.488 --> 28:09.789
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it, too,

28:09.857 --> 28:11.358
and 'cause y'all have been so sweet to me

28:11.425 --> 28:14.027
here today in Hot-lanta,

28:14.095 --> 28:16.796
I thought I would sing the
single from my new album

28:16.864 --> 28:19.933
for you for the very first time.

28:30.110 --> 28:32.645
♪ Well, you know how it
goes when you meet somebody ♪

28:32.713 --> 28:35.180

28:41.654 --> 28:43.155
Yeah. Hey, Brent.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.457
Look, we need to move a major release to May 1st.

28:45.525 --> 28:47.159
Lock in every inch of shelf space...

28:47.227 --> 28:49.061
end caps, register displays.

28:49.129 --> 28:51.430

doesn't get in the stores.

Hey.

29:12.452 --> 29:13.517
We're ready for you.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.919
I didn't mean to fall asleep. Sorry.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.654
That's okay, but we only have the studio

29:16.721 --> 29:17.855
for another 40 minutes,

29:17.923 --> 29:19.290
so if you want to lay something down...

29:19.358 --> 29:20.825
Yeah, I do. Do you have the piano player?

29:20.892 --> 29:22.526
- Yeah. He's here.
- Okay.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.595
Is... is there coffee?

29:24.663 --> 29:26.497
Um...

29:26.565 --> 29:28.032
Are you sure you're up for this?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.067
Yeah. If we don't do it
now, we'll lose the moment.

29:30.134 --> 29:32.069
It's...

29:32.136 --> 29:33.170
You want to take one of these?

29:33.237 --> 29:34.905
I take them for jet lag.

29:34.973 --> 29:36.340
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.908
It's just like drinking a few cups of coffee.

29:40.311 --> 29:41.244
You can keep that if you want.

29:41.312 --> 29:42.713
Thanks.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.648
Just take half of one if you're nervous about it.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.284
Hey. 38 minutes and counting. Come on.

29:47.352 --> 29:48.251
All right.

30:01.965 --> 30:03.499
- FBI!
- What?!

30:03.566 --> 30:04.500
- Don't move.
- No, no, no!

30:04.567 --> 30:05.667
- Don't move.
- No, no, no! No!

30:05.735 --> 30:06.802
- I can't go! I can't...
- Clear the bathroom.

30:06.870 --> 30:08.237
Tandy Hampton,

30:08.305 --> 30:09.671
we have a material-witness
warrant for your arrest.

30:09.739 --> 30:11.272
You can't just skip town and hide.

30:11.340 --> 30:12.774
I had to!

30:12.842 --> 30:15.310
My father will have me killed
if he finds out I'm testifying.

30:27.338 --> 30:29.105
Hey.

30:31.475 --> 30:33.643
I spent the whole day trying to write a song

30:33.710 --> 30:35.711
that would prove Gunnar wrong.

30:35.780 --> 30:38.481
But, uh, turns out he was right.

30:38.548 --> 30:40.850
I'm a blank. I've got nothing to say.

30:40.918 --> 30:42.618
Everybody's got something to say.

30:42.686 --> 30:43.953
No, not me.

30:45.890 --> 30:48.023
I realized today that I spent
my whole life trying to be

30:48.091 --> 30:50.859
the kind of person that my
parents would want me to be.

30:50.927 --> 30:53.061
I did pageants because that's what they wanted,

30:53.129 --> 30:57.132
and I... I did music because
that's what they wanted.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.703
I applied to Harvard because
that's what they wanted.

31:00.771 --> 31:04.973
Now I've gotten so good at it, all the...

31:05.041 --> 31:06.308
that all I can think to say

31:06.375 --> 31:08.844
is what I know they'd want to hear.

31:10.446 --> 31:12.981
Well, believe it or not, I
know exactly how you feel.

31:13.049 --> 31:15.884
I mean, not the part about
the pageants... or Harvard.

31:17.253 --> 31:19.621
But, uh, I do know what it's like

31:19.689 --> 31:24.125
to want to be the person your
parents expect you to be...

31:24.193 --> 31:26.861
and the hurt in their eyes when you fall short.

31:26.929 --> 31:29.431
At least you had the guts to break free.

31:29.498 --> 31:31.499
You know, live the life that you wanted.

31:32.835 --> 31:34.035
Yeah.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.741
Ohh.

31:40.809 --> 31:44.111
Come on. You'll find your way.

31:44.179 --> 31:47.681
Sooner or later...

31:47.749 --> 31:49.317
we all do.

31:52.487 --> 31:54.254
So, how is it that I came out

31:54.322 --> 31:56.089
to support Edgehill's number-one artist

31:56.157 --> 31:58.492
and stumbled onto a Rayna
Jaymes promotional concert?

31:58.560 --> 32:01.161
Well, all I did was invite my girlfriend onstage

32:01.229 --> 32:02.830
- for a little fun.
- Yeah?

32:02.897 --> 32:04.565
The fact that her face is on your team car

32:04.632 --> 32:06.967
is a... strange coincidence?

32:07.034 --> 32:11.238
You know, I heard the label
lost Juliette Barnes last night.

32:11.305 --> 32:12.939
Seems like Edgehill's having a hard time

32:13.007 --> 32:14.540
keeping its artists happy.

32:14.608 --> 32:16.509
Hope that streak doesn't continue, Jeff.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.280
There you go.

32:20.348 --> 32:23.783
"To Maddie. See you in
victory Lane. Austin Dillon."

32:23.851 --> 32:25.952
- Thank you.
- That is very sweet.

32:26.020 --> 32:28.254
It's not every day you get an
autograph from a series champ.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.890
Well, it's not every day I get
to race against Rayna Jaymes.

32:30.957 --> 32:32.492
We even traded a little paint out there today.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.326
I know! Listen, I told them
they should let me drive.

32:34.395 --> 32:35.495
They didn't listen to me.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.796
Well, you're welcome on my team anytime.

32:36.864 --> 32:37.830
Y'all have a good night.

32:37.898 --> 32:39.031
Thank you.

32:39.099 --> 32:40.966
Um, anybody seen Luke?

32:41.034 --> 32:42.835
- I'll go find him.
- 'Course she will.

32:42.903 --> 32:44.336
Rayna. Excuse me.

32:44.404 --> 32:45.170
Hey!

32:45.238 --> 32:46.305
I've been thinking...

32:46.373 --> 32:48.040
maybe we can do some business after all.

32:48.108 --> 32:50.276
- Really? What changed?
- Well, as I told you,

32:50.343 --> 32:52.844
the deals for the existing
shelf space are all taken,

32:52.913 --> 32:55.114
but I thought to myself,

32:55.181 --> 32:57.849
"why don't we just create some new shelf space?"

32:57.918 --> 32:59.618
- You're gonna build me a shelf.
- No, I'm not.

32:59.685 --> 33:01.386
But I'm gonna find you some space

33:01.454 --> 33:03.087
on the shelves that we've already got.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.524
As of this moment, Boone's superstores

33:05.591 --> 33:07.626
is out of the Juliette Barnes business.

33:07.693 --> 33:11.062
Oh, you're gonna... stop carrying her records?

33:11.130 --> 33:14.165
Rule number 6, darling. Protect your brand.

33:14.233 --> 33:15.700
We've been getting pressure

33:15.768 --> 33:18.002
about Juliette Barnes being a bad influence.

33:18.070 --> 33:20.704
And frankly, after the Opry, I can't disagree.

33:22.942 --> 33:24.976
Call my office first thing in the morning.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.911
We'll work out the details.

33:26.979 --> 33:28.179
Thank you, Mr. Boone.

33:36.387 --> 33:38.121
You can't tell me that she won't outperform

33:38.189 --> 33:40.491
75% of your existing artists.

33:40.559 --> 33:42.927
Yeah, well, okay, at this point,
that's probably negotiable,

33:42.994 --> 33:45.095
but let's first agree that
we're going to work together.

33:45.163 --> 33:46.096
This is...

33:46.164 --> 33:47.631
what are you doing?

33:47.699 --> 33:50.867
Glenn, have some pride.

33:50.935 --> 33:52.836
They don't want me.

33:52.903 --> 33:55.005
So, what's the bottom line?

33:55.073 --> 33:57.707
And don't manage me.

33:57.775 --> 33:59.109
I just want to know the truth.

33:59.177 --> 34:01.544
No label will touch you.

34:01.612 --> 34:04.348
You're too high-risk, too expensive.

34:04.415 --> 34:05.982
Six more venues are trying to cancel on us.

34:06.049 --> 34:07.216
I got legal working on it.

34:07.284 --> 34:09.452
Hopefully, we can salvage some of those dates.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.154
But basically, we're in free fall.

34:12.222 --> 34:13.623
You know what?

34:13.690 --> 34:16.425
I think... it's time for you to take

34:16.494 --> 34:18.561
a nice, long vacation.

34:19.730 --> 34:20.996
On me.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.067
You okay?

34:25.135 --> 34:27.036
I'm actually kind of relieved.

34:27.103 --> 34:28.871
Just tired of fighting, you know?

34:28.938 --> 34:32.274
It... it's not fun being Juliette Barnes anymore.

34:32.342 --> 34:35.277
Always having to live up to something,

34:35.344 --> 34:37.980
or worse, live down something.

34:38.047 --> 34:40.748
You know, honestly, starting over

34:40.817 --> 34:45.020
sounds pretty damn good to me right about now.

34:45.087 --> 34:46.388
You playing tonight?

34:46.455 --> 34:48.056
No, just waiting for Erica.

34:48.123 --> 34:49.858
Want to see if I can get my old spot back.

34:49.926 --> 34:51.693
Got some new material I need to work on.

34:51.761 --> 34:53.562
New material?

34:53.630 --> 34:56.563
So I guess that means you,
uh, took the record deal.

34:56.632 --> 34:58.066
I guess that means you and Scarlett

34:58.134 --> 34:59.434
did some chatting before you broke up.

35:01.470 --> 35:03.238
Yeah. I took the deal.

35:03.305 --> 35:05.306
You don't seem very excited.

35:05.374 --> 35:06.774
Oh, it's a lousy deal.

35:06.842 --> 35:08.709
I get $20,000, and they want me to bring in

35:08.777 --> 35:10.378
a whole bunch of superstars to sing on it.

35:10.446 --> 35:11.946
I don't know why I took it in the first place.

35:12.014 --> 35:14.015
Like I'm gonna be something after all these years.

35:14.082 --> 35:16.283
You know, I've wondered...

35:16.351 --> 35:17.985
why didn't you take your shot back in the day,

35:18.053 --> 35:19.720
- when you had some heat?
- I don't know.

35:19.788 --> 35:23.457
I was... playing guitar for
Rayna, writing hit songs.

35:23.525 --> 35:25.960
I guess I just didn't feel
like I needed to be famous.

35:28.163 --> 35:29.163
Do you need it now?

35:36.504 --> 35:38.105
I'm not testifying.

35:38.173 --> 35:41.608
I've got a material-witness
order that says that you are.

35:41.676 --> 35:45.178
If you don't testify, you will lose all immunity,

35:45.245 --> 35:46.680
and that means jail time.

35:46.747 --> 35:48.915
We've got enough evidence to convict you both.

35:48.983 --> 35:50.483
You don't.

35:50.551 --> 35:51.885
Mr. Brinks, you have built your case

35:51.953 --> 35:54.387
based on documents provided by Ms. Hampton.

35:54.455 --> 35:56.255
But she obtained this information illegally.

35:56.323 --> 35:57.624
What are you talking about?

35:57.692 --> 35:59.358
If you check the flash drive that she gave you,

35:59.426 --> 36:01.260
you'll find that the data transfer

36:01.328 --> 36:04.063
from Wyatt Industries computers
occurred on October 16th.

36:04.131 --> 36:05.298
So?

36:05.365 --> 36:06.799
So, Ms. Hampton was no longer employed

36:06.866 --> 36:08.266
by Wyatt industries at the time,

36:08.334 --> 36:10.435
which means that the information was stolen

36:10.503 --> 36:12.804
and is, therefore, completely inadmissible.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.974
We have documents from Wyatt
Industries human resources

36:16.041 --> 36:18.410
saying that you were terminated on the 17th.

36:18.418 --> 36:19.784
Well, it may have taken them about a week

36:19.852 --> 36:22.320
to process that paperwork, but I assure you...

36:22.388 --> 36:26.891
I resigned October 10th, verbally, to my father.

36:26.959 --> 36:28.693
Motion to suppress the flash drive

36:28.761 --> 36:30.828
and all other evidence obtained
as a result of those files.

36:30.896 --> 36:33.431
I'm sorry, but I'd rather see my father go free

36:33.498 --> 36:34.799
than to spend the rest of my life

36:34.867 --> 36:37.068
looking over my shoulder.

36:37.135 --> 36:39.571
Congratulations.

36:39.638 --> 36:41.738
Honestly, I didn't think you had it in you.

36:41.806 --> 36:43.474
Jeff, I am not in the mood.

36:43.542 --> 36:46.143
I just had a nice little
conversation with Mr. Boone.

36:46.211 --> 36:48.379
Juliette's body isn't even cold yet,

36:48.447 --> 36:49.713
and you're dancing on her grave.

36:49.781 --> 36:52.349
Bravo.

36:52.417 --> 36:53.750
Now you're thinking like a label head.

Look, uh...

38:27.478 --> 38:29.980
I guess I'm not used to...

38:30.047 --> 38:31.614
to failing.

38:31.682 --> 38:32.916
But you were right about me.

38:32.984 --> 38:35.252
I... I don't know what it is that I want to say.

38:36.821 --> 38:39.389
Or if I even have anything to say yet, so...

38:39.456 --> 38:40.690
You're young.

38:40.758 --> 38:43.159
You probably just haven't thought about it enough.

38:43.226 --> 38:45.261
Yeah.

38:45.329 --> 38:47.029
So, uh, so what do I do?

38:48.231 --> 38:49.532
How do I start?

38:49.600 --> 38:51.567
You could start writing stuff down...

38:51.635 --> 38:53.636
thoughts, feelings, questions.

38:53.704 --> 38:55.638
- Like a journal?
- Yeah.

38:55.706 --> 38:58.373
You know, one of the best songwriters I know...

38:58.441 --> 39:00.409
she started with a journal.

39:00.476 --> 39:02.278
You reckon your label will go for it?

39:02.345 --> 39:04.379
Who cares?

39:04.447 --> 39:06.315
They're not paying me enough to sell out.

39:07.650 --> 39:09.518
"Deacon Claybourne live at The Bluebird."

39:09.585 --> 39:11.187
It sounds good.

39:11.254 --> 39:12.421
That's really cool

39:12.488 --> 39:13.655
that you're pressing it on vinyl.

39:13.723 --> 39:15.424
Well, it was never my intention to be cool.

39:15.491 --> 39:17.392
I just like the way vinyl sounds.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.761
I guess I'm so far behind the
curve that I'm ahead of it.

39:23.333 --> 39:25.934
You sure Liam's a good match for you?

39:26.001 --> 39:28.203
- Yeah, he's amazing.
- I know he's good.

39:28.270 --> 39:30.772
He just seems like he's, uh,
working you a little hard.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.874
I've been letting people push me around

39:32.942 --> 39:34.408
from the get-go here,

39:34.476 --> 39:37.212
and this is the first time
I feel like I'm in charge.

39:37.279 --> 39:41.716
And this album is going to
be about who I actually am.

39:41.783 --> 39:43.384
Tell you one thing... it's nice to see you excited

39:43.452 --> 39:45.119
about your music again.

39:45.187 --> 39:46.855
Been a while.

39:46.922 --> 39:47.788
For both of us.

39:49.624 --> 39:50.858
Yeah.

39:53.562 --> 39:54.895
Turning down distribution

39:54.963 --> 39:56.797
with the largest
brick-and-mortar in the country?

39:56.865 --> 39:58.966
You are one ballsy lady.

39:59.033 --> 40:02.236
According to Sam Boone, I
didn't really have a choice.

40:02.303 --> 40:06.073
Rule number 6... protect your brand.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.374
What are you talking about?

40:07.441 --> 40:08.808
You know, at the end of the day,

40:08.877 --> 40:11.011
I want Highway 65 to be a refuge for artists...

40:11.079 --> 40:14.014
a place where you can go and
have the freedom to create.

40:14.082 --> 40:16.816
If I do business the way Sam Boone does business,

40:16.885 --> 40:19.419
I'm just going against everything I believe in.

40:19.487 --> 40:22.021
I mean, Juliette Barnes can be a pain in the ass.

40:22.089 --> 40:24.391
But I will be damned if I'm gonna take part

40:24.458 --> 40:27.427
in some corporate jackass
trying to squelch her voice.

40:27.495 --> 40:30.162
Well. I'm starting to think
I signed with the wrong label.

40:30.230 --> 40:32.399
Oh, do not even get me on the subject.

40:33.934 --> 40:35.502
- Luke. What are you doing here?
- Hey. How are you?

40:35.569 --> 40:37.436
Well, I brought over some breakfast,

40:37.504 --> 40:39.972
and I thought maybe I would help

40:40.040 --> 40:41.407
with the Monday-morning carpool.

40:41.474 --> 40:42.508
What do you say?

40:42.575 --> 40:43.242
- No way!
- Take a look.

40:49.416 --> 40:50.649
Yes!

40:52.685 --> 40:55.421
Mom, you are not taking me to school in that.

41:02.161 --> 41:03.194
Hello?

41:03.262 --> 41:05.263
Turn on your TV... Channel 9.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.535
Opening arguments were expected today

41:09.602 --> 41:11.736
in the case against Lamar Wyatt.

41:11.804 --> 41:14.072
Instead, in a stunning turn of events,

41:14.140 --> 41:15.974
all charges have been dropped.

41:16.042 --> 41:17.608
You were right.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.910
He is untouchable.

41:18.978 --> 41:20.578
We're waiting on an official statement

41:20.646 --> 41:22.347
from the U.S. Attorney's office,

41:22.415 --> 41:25.317
but sources say Lamar Wyatt will be released

41:25.384 --> 41:27.552
within 24 hours.

41:43.568 --> 41:44.768
Hey.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.070
Hey.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.637
You ready for some more magic?

41:47.705 --> 41:49.139
Yeah, let's go.

41:55.613 --> 41:56.513
Hey.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.450
I cooked you dinner.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.084
Come on in.

42:06.991 --> 42:10.660
You know, you really had me convinced

42:10.728 --> 42:13.530
that I'd be okay if everything disappeared.

42:13.598 --> 42:16.099
But now that it has, I realized

42:16.166 --> 42:19.469
that there is one thing that I need,

42:19.536 --> 42:21.270
one thing I have to have.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.478
You.
