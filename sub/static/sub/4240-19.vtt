11:39.824 --> 11:41.950
and, as I suspected,
my intuition has been
proven correct.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.996
My mother is Broadway legend
Patti LuPone.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.998
I've always had a deep
connection to Miss LuPone—

11:48.083 --> 11:50.292
her choice of roles and songs.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.921
I decided to do a little math
to see if her being my mother
was even possible.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.632
I was born December 18, 1994.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.176
1994 was a big year for Mother.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.720
She was a sensation in Pal Joey.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.972
But that was New York.
I was born in Ohio, you say.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.893
Well, Mother took many breaks
from the show to tour
with Mandy Patinkin.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.854
That April found them
at the EJ Thomas Hall
in Akron, Ohio,

12:10.939 --> 12:14.400
for a standing-room performance
nine months before I was born.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.986
Are you saying that your fathers
impregnated Patti LuPone
in the Marriott in Akron?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.780
Was Mandy Patinkin
in on this?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.865
All you have to do
is look at pictures of her...

12:21.950 --> 12:23.867
in her performance
in Master Class in 1996.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.037
Look at the pain in her eyes
and the hurt she's feeling...

12:27.122 --> 12:29.164
from giving up her obviously
talented little girl.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.750
One question.
What was in it for her?

12:31.835 --> 12:36.004
Mo-Money, a-a sense of charity
for those in need.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.220
No. I guess you're right.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.265
Do you want to hear my research
that proves that my mother
is Bernadette Peters?

12:46.349 --> 12:48.225
Why are you so afraid
about finding the truth?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.936
I don't know. I guess I just
don't want to think...

12:51.020 --> 12:53.605
that my mother's
some teenage trollop like Quinn...

12:53.690 --> 12:56.191
or, worse, some skanky girl
who would do anything for money,

12:56.276 --> 12:58.193
including giving me up.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.195
Why does it have to be
one of those choices?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.489
Maybe she had a really good reason
for doing what she did.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.533
We need to do
a real investigation,

13:04.617 --> 13:07.161
like CSI real.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.496
Do you have any baby stuff
in your house- something
that might give us a clue?

13:09.581 --> 13:11.957
My fathers kept
every piece of paper
related to my life...

13:12.041 --> 13:13.959

I'm gonna dance one day,
you know.
I know you are.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.284
[School Bell Rings]
I thought you were gonna take
a hatchet to that Glee Club.

26:59.368 --> 27:03.121
I was, but you
may have heard...

27:03.205 --> 27:05.748
I plan on making my return
to the stage next month...

27:05.833 --> 27:07.959
in a local production
of Les Mis.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.545
And I've had something
of a personal awakening,

27:10.629 --> 27:14.966
so I've decided to examine
all of the extracurricular
activities here at this school.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.886
And, Sue, your Cheerios budget
is out of control.

27:18.971 --> 27:23.099
Let me remind you
of something, Mr. Ryan.
The Cheerios sell tickets.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.143
Not enough
to offset your costs.

27:25.227 --> 27:28.730
I am very tired of athletics
always taking a back seat.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.774
When daily P.E.
was cut at this school,
no one batted an eye.

27:31.859 --> 27:35.570
But cut a dance program,
cancel the school musical,
and suddenly there's an uproar.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.072
I did a little research, Sue.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.074
Did you know
that studies have shown...

27:40.159 --> 27:43.119
that reading Shakespeare
might help kids learn physics?

27:43.203 --> 27:45.663
That singing helps you
learn pitch...

27:45.748 --> 27:47.749
which makes learning
a foreign language easier.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.335
That when a kid picks up
a clarinet or a trumpet,

27:50.419 --> 27:53.421
every region of the cerebral cortex
is stimulated.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.423
Well, that's all very interesting,

27:55.507 --> 27:58.343
but did you know that a third
of American teenagers are obese?

27:58.427 --> 28:01.929
And only two percent
of high schools require any
form of daily physical activity.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.973
Where's your outrage
about that, Mr. Ryan?

28:04.058 --> 28:06.100
Sports teach kids
how to work together,

28:06.185 --> 28:08.186
teaches problem-solving
and social skills.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.480
It improves attendance,
not to mention grades,

28:10.564 --> 28:12.857
particularly
among those students
deemed most at risk.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.526
You've done your homework.
I'm an educator.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.322
Now, I realize my methods
are unconventional,

28:19.406 --> 28:21.324
but my record speaks for itself.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.577
Is it a tad over the top
to bill the district
for skydiving lessons...

28:24.661 --> 28:27.789
to have the Cheerios
parachuted onto
the football field?

28:27.873 --> 28:30.833
Perhaps. But what I do here
makes a difference.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.752
Sue, you're an impressive woman.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.047
I can't tell you how much
you turn me on right now.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.342
You ever heard of the term
"anger sex"?
It's the only kind I know.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.594
I should tell you I'm married.
Not a problem for me.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.389
And I'm still cutting
half your budget.
You win some, you lose some.

28:44.515 --> 28:47.266
Should I lock the door?
No.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.394
Got a secret room upstairs.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.313
Like Letterman.
[Exhales]

28:57.319 --> 28:59.362
She has the tape.

28:59.488 --> 29:03.074
She won't listen to it.
What?

29:03.158 --> 29:06.953
She has to listen to it.
That's the point of all this.

29:07.037 --> 29:10.415
I'm doing my best.
Look, when you told me
to seduce her-

29:10.499 --> 29:12.291
"Befriend" her was the word
I used actually.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.752
Whatever. The thing is,

29:14.837 --> 29:17.255
I was into it because
I thought it would be
a good acting exercise.

29:17.339 --> 29:20.842
But now I think
I kind of like her.
I don't want her to get hurt.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.844
Look, one more week,
this will all be done.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.971
You can come back
to Vocal Adrenaline
where you belong.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.348
I don't understand why you
don't just go up to her and say...

29:27.433 --> 29:29.934
"Hi. My name's Shelby.
I'm your mom."

29:30.018 --> 29:33.771
I signed a contract.
I can't contact her
until she's 18.

29:33.856 --> 29:37.358
She has to come to me.
That's why she has
to listen to the tape.

29:38.902 --> 29:42.196
Once she hears it,
she won't be able to sleep
until she finds me.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.786
I answered an ad
in the paper.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.913
Nine months' work here
would make me
enough money...

29:50.998 --> 29:52.623
to live in New York
for two years.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.209
Her dads seemed
like nice guys,
so I went for it.

29:57.171 --> 29:59.172
I never got to hold her.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.594
And I only saw her
for a second...

30:04.678 --> 30:07.472
when they were
cleaning her off.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.474
It was through
a bunch of nurses,

30:09.558 --> 30:11.726
but she turned her little head
and she looked at me.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.195
[Laughs]
I failed as an actress.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.865
My walls are lined with trophies
instead of wedding pictures.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.950
But through all of that,

30:29.995 --> 30:32.079
I only have one regret.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.917
You get her to listen
to that tape.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.220
[School Bell Rings]
You know, honestly,

30:47.304 --> 30:49.514
the only students
that come and see me
on a scheduled weekly basis...

30:49.598 --> 30:52.683
are ones that have been diagnosed
with psychological disorders,

30:52.768 --> 30:55.311
like a certain junior female
that eats her own hair.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.438
When I start walking,
I'm gonna need help...

30:57.523 --> 31:00.399
emotionally adapting
to my drastically
altered lifestyle.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.735
Walking?

31:02.819 --> 31:06.072
There are all
these new therapies
for my condition.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.741
I figure, if I try them all,
one's bound to work.

31:10.953 --> 31:12.870
Um,

31:14.206 --> 31:16.749
you know, Artie,
I've, um-

31:16.833 --> 31:18.292
You know I've read
your file before.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.003
Um,

31:21.088 --> 31:25.299
the damage to your spinal cord's
pretty severe.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.553
Irreversible.
I think you know that.

31:28.637 --> 31:32.014
I used to know that
until I saw the research.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.272
Do you know how long
the testing process takes
for medical protocols like this?

31:40.691 --> 31:43.818
At least... 10 years,

31:43.902 --> 31:46.195
and- and that's before
they even start human trials.

31:46.280 --> 31:51.325
So, you know, these—
these studies really aren't
even in their infancies yet.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.457
Look, I- I truly believe
that there's going
to be a doctor...

31:58.542 --> 32:00.543
that finds a cure
for what happened to you.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.004
But I—

32:03.088 --> 32:07.216
You know, I don't think
that's gonna be
for a long time.

32:10.387 --> 32:14.140
You know what.
Um, maybe you're right.

32:14.224 --> 32:18.144
Maybe you should
start coming to see me
once a week for a while.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.192
Thanks, Miss Pillsbury.

Guys, I've got good news.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.122
I siphoned off funds
from the Cheerios,

32:38.206 --> 32:41.125
and I took
a little shopping spree
through the Jazz Hands catalog.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.711
You know why?
'Cause the arts matter.

32:43.795 --> 32:49.383

at convincing you
not to cut the program.

Give it a rest, Will.
You think you're
helping these kids,

is setting them up
to be jaded and bitter.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.614
You're right.
Cut the program,

34:35.699 --> 34:37.867

certainly more likely
to turn out like you.

of your insults, Will.

want to punch your face.
