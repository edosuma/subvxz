01:10.380 --> 01:12.670
Lucky: This vacation's getting
weirder and weirder.

01:12.670 --> 01:15.790
First Cruella invites
herself along,

01:15.790 --> 01:19.580
then Roger and Anita find out
they're not legally married.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.120
So they decide to head
to their old church

01:21.120 --> 01:22.830
and get married for real.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.620
But Cruella finds out
that if she can keep them

01:25.620 --> 01:27.750
from getting married
in the next ten days,

01:27.750 --> 01:30.540
she can claim our farm
for herself.

01:30.540 --> 01:32.710
So she makes it look like Roger

01:32.710 --> 01:35.420
signed up for a baseball team
in Venezuela,

01:35.420 --> 01:39.880
which makes Anita so mad,
she walks out on Roger.

01:39.880 --> 01:43.330
Oh, how could this have
happened?!

01:43.330 --> 01:46.540
Oh, I know: I did it.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.000
Anita: So, Roger thinks
our wedding isn't as important

01:56.000 --> 01:57.750
as his baseball career.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.040
He can't even hit a curve.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.040
I am strong,
I am invincible.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.500
I am scared spotless!

02:05.500 --> 02:10.210
Can't hit a curve,
can't balance a checkbook.

02:10.210 --> 02:13.170
He's really completely helpless
without me.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.210
I hope he's okay.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.290
Lucky: Roger has got it bad!

02:22.290 --> 02:23.540
Spot: He's going through

02:23.540 --> 02:26.460
all the classic stages
of depression.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.750
Denial, anger, pizza...

02:42.290 --> 02:46.120
Actually, this depression thing
isn't such a bad deal.

02:51.920 --> 02:55.120
My plan turned out
even better than I expected.

02:56.170 --> 02:58.380
I've broken them up.

02:58.380 --> 02:59.710
Permanently!

02:59.710 --> 03:02.710
Now, let's get back to Grutely.
I have a farm to claim!

03:06.170 --> 03:09.040
Horace: Uh, the door's locked,
Miss De Vil.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.080
Cruella: You just always have to
ruin it for me, don't you?

03:14.880 --> 03:17.580
Oh, this is hopeless.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.210
We gotta do something.

03:27.210 --> 03:29.210
woman: Today on "Cheap Talk,"

03:29.210 --> 03:32.120
men who love baseball
and the women who leave them.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.710
Lucky: Oops!

03:35.120 --> 03:37.080
man: Now back
to Co-ed Motocross:

03:37.080 --> 03:38.790
women on motorcycles

03:38.790 --> 03:40.960
leaving their pathetic men
in the dust.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.330
Yaaaah!

03:46.420 --> 03:48.120
But it'll be fun
in Venezuela.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.120
How could you choose
business over our wedding?

03:51.120 --> 03:54.250
Maybe it's a good thing
we were never married
in the first place.

03:54.250 --> 03:57.120
Sweetheart, I made a mistake.
Don't go, please.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.080
Don't go!

04:01.120 --> 04:03.960
How could I let her go?
I've got to find her.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.710
How could I let her get away?

04:06.710 --> 04:07.960
I've got to find her.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.580
Roger, with TV:
I've got to find her.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.170
I've got
to find her!

04:18.460 --> 04:19.790
Oof!

04:19.790 --> 04:22.000
Did you hear that?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.960
He's going
to find her!

04:23.960 --> 04:25.330
Get the truck!

04:28.880 --> 04:32.420
No! You parked
in a tow!

04:34.000 --> 04:37.620
Uh, that was a bad thing, right?

04:37.620 --> 04:42.040
Arrgh! I should have you
towed away, you lug nuts!

04:42.040 --> 04:45.080
Get me some wheels! Now!

04:46.210 --> 04:48.620
But you said
to bring you
some wheels.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.120
Just shut up
and pedal.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.420
Roger: Gotta find Anita.

04:57.420 --> 04:58.790
Gotta find Anita.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.330
Have no idea
where Anita is.

05:00.330 --> 05:01.620
I gotta find Anita.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.620
Rolly, you've got
the best nose.

05:04.620 --> 05:07.120
See if you can
pick up a scent.

05:09.710 --> 05:13.080
Oh, yeah, papa!

05:13.080 --> 05:16.080
The 99-cent rib special
at Barbecue Betty's.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.580
12 degrees south-southwest,
range 4 miles.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.880
Wait a sec.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.670
Anita!

05:25.040 --> 05:27.380
What is it, Rolly?
Do you smell something?

05:27.380 --> 05:28.540
Is it Anita?

05:31.380 --> 05:32.960
Atta-boy, Rolly!

05:38.750 --> 05:41.040
I mean, the time had come.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.880
We needed space
to sort things out.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.960
Oooh!

05:45.960 --> 05:48.330
Now, I just feel so alone.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.670
Cadpig!

05:53.790 --> 05:55.880
What are you doing here?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.920
I know, I know.
What am I doing here?

06:00.920 --> 06:04.170
I didn't give Roger a chance
to explain himself, did I?

06:05.750 --> 06:07.040
Did I do the right thing?

06:07.040 --> 06:09.040
Ohh!

06:09.040 --> 06:11.830
Cadpig! Mwah!

06:11.830 --> 06:14.880
It's almost as though
you understand what I'm saying.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.750
What should I do, huh?

06:20.120 --> 06:21.920
My wedding ring?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.080
But where...?

06:23.080 --> 06:27.040
"Anita and Roger,
now and forever."

06:28.210 --> 06:30.960
Oh, Cadpig, you are so right!

06:30.960 --> 06:32.750
What was I thinking?

06:37.250 --> 06:38.830
I've been so silly.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.580
I love him!

06:52.880 --> 06:54.920
Huh?

06:59.250 --> 07:00.420
Aaaaaaah!

07:00.420 --> 07:01.920
Please, spare us,

07:01.920 --> 07:03.500
o giant alien dog!

07:03.500 --> 07:06.210
We are a peace-loving planet!

07:06.210 --> 07:09.250
Hey, relax,
I'm not gonna bite.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.460
Uh... who are you?

07:12.460 --> 07:16.500
My name is Willy, but you
can call me Zenox V.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.620
I almost hit you
with my van.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.830
It's a good thing you
swerved at the last second,

07:20.830 --> 07:23.830
but I'm afraid your bike
is totaled.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.120
But... where...?

07:26.120 --> 07:28.790
Why don't you come
and meet the others?

07:29.830 --> 07:33.000
This is Anita,
Saucerites.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.040
all: Greetings, Anita!
Have some mashed potatoes.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.290
Just what is going on here?

07:42.290 --> 07:44.920
We're the Society for Achieving
Utopian Consciousness

07:44.920 --> 07:47.040
via Extraterrestrial Rebirth

07:47.040 --> 07:49.670
and Desert Operational
Lacrosse Team.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.670
Together, we play lacrosse

07:51.670 --> 07:52.920
and wait
for the great mothership

07:52.920 --> 07:57.000
to return and take us
to the planet Dripnon,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.330
where the rivers run with gold!

08:00.330 --> 08:02.290
Uh, I'm sure

08:02.290 --> 08:03.330
this is just

08:03.330 --> 08:04.920
a stupid hat convention,

08:04.920 --> 08:06.290
isn't it?

08:06.290 --> 08:08.080
No, no, brother.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.750
It is the planet
Durdlezig,

08:09.750 --> 08:11.790
where the rivers
run with orange juice.

08:11.790 --> 08:13.920
man: Blasphemers!

08:13.920 --> 08:15.880
It is the planet Squignot,

08:15.880 --> 08:18.420
where the rivers run
with cream soda!

08:24.960 --> 08:26.750
-Planet Squignot!
-Cream soda!

08:29.670 --> 08:31.170
You know, these people

08:31.170 --> 08:32.250
are whacko.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.790
You think I'm wearing
this hat by choice?

08:36.080 --> 08:40.580
man: Squignot! Squignot!
Cream soda!

08:40.580 --> 08:42.750
Look, I hate
to disturb

08:42.750 --> 08:45.120
your little
philosophical
debate here,

08:45.120 --> 08:47.750
but I really have
to find my husband.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.380
Uh, we may disagree
on the details,

08:50.380 --> 08:52.830
but we do agree
on one thing:

08:52.830 --> 08:54.420
no one leaves here.

08:54.420 --> 08:57.500
all: Not until the little shaggy
green messenger

08:57.500 --> 09:01.080
from the mothership arrives
to lead us home.

09:01.080 --> 09:05.790
Uh... look, I, uh...
I really have to be going.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.710
How do I get
these kooks to let her go?

09:08.710 --> 09:12.710
Won't happen,
not till their little shaggy
green alien messenger comes.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.670
Shaggy green messenger?

09:22.710 --> 09:23.710
Yes!

09:23.710 --> 09:24.710
What?

09:34.120 --> 09:37.620
man: It is the shaggy green one
whose coming was foretold!

09:37.620 --> 09:41.080
all: O shaggy green one!

09:41.080 --> 09:43.170
Lead us to the mothership.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.620
And to Dripnon!

09:44.620 --> 09:47.670
-Durdlezig!
-Squignot!
-Orange juice!

09:51.790 --> 09:54.290
Brothers, sisters, please!

09:54.290 --> 09:56.670
We must follow the messenger.

09:56.670 --> 09:59.790
all: Yes! Follow the messenger.

09:59.790 --> 10:02.330
Come on, Cadpig.

10:05.710 --> 10:07.830
But you left without dessert!

10:07.830 --> 10:10.080
I made a lovely
chocolate landing pad!

10:11.920 --> 10:15.330
Oh, yeah, I'm
getting a definite
whiff of Cadpig.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.080
And Anita!

10:17.080 --> 10:19.250
And, unless I'm mistaken...

10:20.580 --> 10:22.750
mashed potatoes?!

10:22.750 --> 10:23.880
I hope you're right.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.830
Cruella's probably
right on our tails.

10:26.830 --> 10:29.170
Stroke, stroke, stroke,
stroke!

10:29.170 --> 10:32.580
Put your backs into it,
you sluggards!

10:32.580 --> 10:36.000
woman: Speed up or ship out,
you road hog!

10:39.500 --> 10:44.290
Slow down, you speed demon!
Stop, stop, stop!

10:45.790 --> 10:47.830
Oh, this is ridiculous.

10:47.830 --> 10:51.040
We must stop Ripsnort
before he finds Anita.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.120
It's... it's the Heck's Angels.

11:01.580 --> 11:03.330
Hitchhikers, huh?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.040
I eat hitchhikers for lunch!

11:06.040 --> 11:08.540
Oh, not in that outfit,
you don't.

11:08.540 --> 11:13.210
Leather and chains,
all wrong for a formal luncheon.

11:13.210 --> 11:18.920
Overaccessorized, understylized,
and completely lacking élan.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.710
You're purty!

11:20.710 --> 11:23.460
Oh, get your big paws
off of me!

11:23.460 --> 11:24.830
Ow! Oh!

11:24.830 --> 11:27.540
Well, I never!

11:27.540 --> 11:29.710
Well, there was that one time.

11:29.710 --> 11:33.290
bikers:
You're kind of cute, too!

11:36.880 --> 11:38.540
Faster! Faster!

11:38.540 --> 11:40.460
The needle's not even
in the red!

11:40.460 --> 11:44.920
We may be rebels, but we don't
exceed the posted speed limit.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.960
You know, motorcycle safety
begins with --

11:47.960 --> 11:49.210
Hyaah!

11:53.330 --> 11:54.920
What a woman!

11:59.460 --> 12:01.120
Hmm?

12:01.120 --> 12:04.830
Dispatch, I need backup!

12:04.830 --> 12:06.670
I got a whole mess
of Heck's Angels

12:06.670 --> 12:10.750
eastbound on the S42,
led by one gutsy mama!

12:13.170 --> 12:15.920
Okay, we're getting hot, guys!

12:17.210 --> 12:21.750
Eww! Now I smell
chocolate landing pad?

12:21.750 --> 12:23.330
I hope we're almost there.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.960
We've only got six hours left

12:24.960 --> 12:27.040
till Cruella takes the farm.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.750
Hey, guys, any chance Cruella
would be leading a tour group

12:30.750 --> 12:32.460
of really grungy poets?

12:32.460 --> 12:33.880
Lucky:
Not really.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.170
Okay, then I only have
one thing to say.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.880
We're doomed!

12:42.380 --> 12:43.960
Run 'em off the road!

12:43.960 --> 12:45.210
Hey!

12:49.790 --> 12:52.380
So, Cruella's gone
biker, huh?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.960
Let's just see
how good she is.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.000
Everyone, give me a hand!

13:02.170 --> 13:04.460
Let's see how good
she can collate.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.420
Litter bugs!

13:08.420 --> 13:10.670
Okay, let's see
how she can handle

13:10.670 --> 13:13.210
a good
old-fashioned
obstacle course.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.330
Uggh! Aaaah!

13:21.080 --> 13:23.670
I'm in the middle of something.
Take a message!

13:23.670 --> 13:26.500
Units 3, 4, and 5,
cut 'em off!

13:34.460 --> 13:36.330
Come on, everybody!

13:55.540 --> 13:57.380
Uggh! Uggg! Whoa!

13:57.380 --> 13:59.170
Gotcha!

13:59.170 --> 14:02.580
I've been after you for days!

14:02.580 --> 14:06.290
Hmm, and now you've
got me.

14:06.290 --> 14:10.380
Ooh, you really are
the strong arm of the law.

14:13.460 --> 14:17.210
No, my friend.
They have gone
to the east.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.960
East! That's not
the way back home.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.250
The church!

14:21.250 --> 14:22.750
She must have changed
her mind.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.750
She's
headed to the church!

14:24.750 --> 14:26.250
Say what?

14:26.250 --> 14:28.790
Uh, wait, take
some chocolate
landing pad!

14:28.790 --> 14:30.380
It's good reheated!

14:33.500 --> 14:36.420
Yes, and I need the chapel
until half-past noon.

14:36.420 --> 14:39.210
No, I won't be needing
the organist.

14:39.210 --> 14:42.460
If you'll cooperate,
we'll go easy on ya.

14:42.460 --> 14:47.120
Now, for the last time,
give me back my squad car!

14:59.710 --> 15:03.170
There's the church!
I mean, the mothership.

15:05.790 --> 15:09.620
Huh
It's the mothership!

15:09.620 --> 15:12.460
Saucerites: The mothership!

15:14.460 --> 15:19.290
Only half an hour
till it's
goodbye, farm!

15:19.290 --> 15:21.120
Aw, we got it made.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.460
What could possibly
get in our way now?

15:24.460 --> 15:25.670
Oh, no!

15:25.670 --> 15:27.460
announcer: This parade
is brought to you by...

15:27.460 --> 15:30.380
Spot: You just had to say that!

15:30.380 --> 15:33.500
Rolly: Oh, man, how are we
gonna get passed that?

15:54.710 --> 15:56.620
Hah! Lost them!

16:22.710 --> 16:26.000
We'll never find Cadpig
and Anita in all of this!

16:26.000 --> 16:27.960
Roger?

16:27.960 --> 16:30.210
Roger: Anita?

16:30.210 --> 16:32.670
-It's Anita!

16:34.330 --> 16:36.170
Anita: Roger?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.290
Lucky!

16:41.290 --> 16:42.380
Cadpig!

16:46.790 --> 16:47.880
Hi, guys.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.420
Ohh!

16:52.420 --> 16:53.210
Ooop!

16:53.210 --> 16:56.670
Hey, where is
the shaggy green messenger?

16:57.960 --> 17:00.750
Hey, something
smells like
old leather.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.250
Uggh!

17:02.250 --> 17:05.000
Saucerite: It is
the shaggy green messenger!

17:06.170 --> 17:08.210
Aaaaaaaah!

17:12.880 --> 17:14.880
That takes
care of Cruella.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.250
Yeah, but we gotta
do something fast.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.210
Time's running out.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.290
Hmm.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.750
-I've got an idea!
-Oh, no.

17:27.250 --> 17:30.460
-Anita!
-Roger!

17:30.460 --> 17:32.580
Roger: Whoa!

17:32.580 --> 17:33.540
Anita!

17:33.540 --> 17:35.670
Roger!

17:35.670 --> 17:36.920
Anita, I've been --

17:36.920 --> 17:38.250
Roger, you don't --

17:38.250 --> 17:39.620
Anita, I have been
such a --

17:39.620 --> 17:42.210
Shh! Darling,
I've been the silly one.

17:42.210 --> 17:44.330
Whoa!

17:53.250 --> 17:54.920
Ohhh!

17:56.170 --> 17:57.960
Can you help us?

17:57.960 --> 18:00.120
Can you lead the parade
to the church?

18:00.120 --> 18:03.330
Please?
It's a true love emergency.

18:03.330 --> 18:06.790
Why certainly, young lady.
Noooo problem.

18:13.830 --> 18:15.880
Whee-haa!

18:15.880 --> 18:17.380
Whoaaaaa!

18:19.620 --> 18:21.170
Wow, a police escort.

18:21.170 --> 18:24.460
Oh, look, Roger.
It's the church!

18:30.920 --> 18:32.420
I tried to
tell you, Anita.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.250
Somebody was playing
a trick on me.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.250
I never signed any
baseball contract.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.250
Not on purpose,
anyway.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.460
I'm so sorry, Roger.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.500
I should never
have doubted you.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.170
I love you.

18:44.170 --> 18:46.170
I love you, too.

18:48.330 --> 18:51.170
Wow! We've got
everything but
a brass band!

18:59.120 --> 19:03.460
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

19:03.460 --> 19:07.500
to witness the joining
of these two loving souls.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.080
If anyone present
knows any reason

19:11.080 --> 19:13.080
why these two
should not be wed,

19:13.080 --> 19:15.250
speak now
or forever hold your --

19:15.250 --> 19:18.250
Yes! I am Cruella de Vil,

19:18.250 --> 19:21.580
and I've booked this chapel
for the next half-hour.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.040
You have?

19:24.120 --> 19:26.080
Well, just a minute,
let me check.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.290
Hmm.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.210
Why, Miss De Vil, so you have.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.620
But I'm in the middle
of a ceremony right now.

19:31.620 --> 19:34.580
-You'll have to wait a bit.

19:34.580 --> 19:37.250
That's all right,
we're in no hurry.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.040
We can wait.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.380
No! It'll be too late!

19:40.380 --> 19:42.790
I'm so happy
for you, Cruella!

19:42.790 --> 19:44.080
Are you
getting married?

19:44.080 --> 19:46.170
Who's the poor vict--
uh, lucky groom?

19:46.170 --> 19:49.290
Groom? I... uh... Him!

19:50.670 --> 19:54.040
I was gonna ask you, but...

19:54.040 --> 19:56.120
I accept.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.460
No, she's mine!
I love her!

19:59.460 --> 20:01.210
Will you marry me?

20:01.210 --> 20:05.290
No! She's mine.
Marry me.

20:05.290 --> 20:07.790
Arrgh! No, she's mine!

20:07.790 --> 20:10.170
Step aside, buster.
Marry me!

20:10.170 --> 20:11.830
No, me!

20:11.830 --> 20:13.380
Marry me!

20:13.380 --> 20:14.750
Say, how about me?

20:14.750 --> 20:17.210
No, she belongs to us.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.580
Saucerites:
She's ours!

20:19.580 --> 20:22.880
Oh, spring must really be
in the air.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.790
You... you all...

20:26.920 --> 20:29.500
l

20:29.500 --> 20:32.330
Yeah, more than Ada Wisgazer.

20:34.790 --> 20:37.920
I am so glad you've
finally found love, Cruella.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.000
Now you know how
Roger and I feel.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.170
I... I...

20:42.170 --> 20:43.710
I do?

20:44.880 --> 20:47.000
Oh, I do!

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
You're right: you two
go ahead and get married.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.170
As for all of you,

20:52.170 --> 20:55.040
let's talk
prenuptial agreement.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.830
Here's my
abbreviated version.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.790
all: Ehhh!

21:01.790 --> 21:03.830
Hmm!

21:03.830 --> 21:05.000
Come on, Cruella.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.080
I'd like you to be
my bridesmaid.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.540
Roger: With this ring,
I thee wed.

21:11.750 --> 21:15.080
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

21:18.420 --> 21:21.000
You may kiss the bride.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.330
Huh? Yowww!

21:39.330 --> 21:40.790
Ha ha!

21:49.540 --> 21:51.790
Well, whaddya know?

21:51.790 --> 21:55.080
I was
the shaggy green messenger!

21:57.580 --> 22:01.330
Cruella: So, where are we
going for the honeymoon?

22:01.330 --> 22:04.170
Roger: Out! Out, Cruella.
I don't wanna hear anymore!

22:04.170 --> 22:06.210
Cruella: But, Ribbit!
You're not serious.

22:06.210 --> 22:07.250
Roger: Out!
