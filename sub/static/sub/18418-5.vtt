00:00.460 --> 00:01.120
- [Voiceover]
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.120 --> 00:02.380
- What's all this?

00:02.380 --> 00:03.880
- This didn't even
come through the mail,

00:03.880 --> 00:05.120
It didn't have a stamp on it
or anything.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.460
- Which means they were here.

00:06.460 --> 00:08.620
- Randall has just
come on to help us

00:08.620 --> 00:10.380
with our marketing
and social media.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.830
- Oh, no, no.
- Hey!

00:15.830 --> 00:17.120
What's your name?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.920
- Maddie.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.290
- If you will let me,

00:20.290 --> 00:22.080
I think could help
Highway 65 flourish.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.710
- I got the perfect
director for you.

00:23.710 --> 00:24.960
- It's a visual love letter

00:24.960 --> 00:27.710
to a woman so electric
and alive,

00:27.710 --> 00:28.960
she can't be contained.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.750
- Riverwood.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.170
I used to come here
when I was a kid.

00:33.170 --> 00:34.540
When I heard your pitch,
I knew this would be

00:34.540 --> 00:36.460
the perfect place
to shoot the video.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.960
- It's even more perfect
than I imagined, so thank you.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.210
- No, I'm so thrilled
you were available.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.540
- Well, it's all this guy.
- (laughs)

00:44.540 --> 00:46.290
But you should probably hold off
thanking or blaming him

00:46.290 --> 00:47.920
until I've completed the job.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.380
- Damien is being
criminally modest.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.040
- Well, I appreciate it.
It's a big favor.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.540
- Rayna, it only took
one listen to the Exes

00:53.540 --> 00:55.670
for this to stop being a favor.

00:55.670 --> 00:57.250
My only worry since

00:57.250 --> 00:58.920
has been about doing
justice to the material.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.460
- I'm confident that you will.

01:02.170 --> 01:03.880
- Hey, how are you two doing?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.500
You need anything?

01:05.500 --> 01:08.120
- My name's Scott...
Gunnar Scott.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.460
- (chuckles) Perfect.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.120
- Wow.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.290
- Feels a little bit more
like a slip than a dress.

01:14.290 --> 01:16.710
- Here. Let me get a picture
for Damien anyway...

01:16.710 --> 01:18.080
- No need. Lay it on me.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.500
- You can see my everything
through it.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.210
- We're telling the story
of a woman who's wild.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.500
Who acts our her daydreams and
her mood swings upon the world,

01:26.500 --> 01:28.880
because she has
absolutely no filter

01:28.880 --> 01:31.540
between what's in there
and what's out here.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.080
She works her way
inside this man

01:33.080 --> 01:36.460
like heroine rewires
the brain.

01:36.460 --> 01:39.210
- I got no idea what that's
got to do with this dress.

01:39.210 --> 01:41.170
- Because it's stunning.
And it speaks to the character.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.120
Trust me. You look radiant.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.920
Just lose these bits,

01:46.920 --> 01:48.580
and lower the neckline,
And then we'll be good to go.

01:48.580 --> 01:49.750
- Okay.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.290
- Here's Damien's long form.

01:54.290 --> 01:57.000
This locks in
our production insurance.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.210
Crew wants double pay
for overtime.

02:00.210 --> 02:03.620
- Wow. It's time and a half
for the first two hours.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.790
And then double time for the...

02:07.330 --> 02:08.500
Umm...

02:10.710 --> 02:11.880
- Everything okay?

02:15.500 --> 02:16.500
- Where's Randall?

02:16.500 --> 02:17.920
- He's out sick.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.620

02:43.290 --> 02:45.500
Only songwriter to be covered
by the Beatles,

02:45.500 --> 02:47.960
the Stones and Dylan.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.710
Still nobody has heard of him.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.120
- I like it.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.790
- I'll make you a mix.

02:52.790 --> 02:55.670
Now this cut, it charted as R&B.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.580
But if you cut out
those gospel harmonies

02:57.580 --> 02:59.540
and focus in on
the twangy guitar line...

02:59.540 --> 03:01.170
- It's a country song.

03:01.170 --> 03:02.960
- Wow, okay, it's almost like

03:02.960 --> 03:04.750

03:08.170 --> 03:10.000
I actually knew something
before you came along.

got to go listen to music is...

03:12.750 --> 03:13.880
Joe's.

- What's that?

03:15.120 --> 03:17.040
- (chuckles) For real?

03:17.040 --> 03:18.210
- Oh, my God, I get it.

03:18.210 --> 03:20.380
I am sheltered and uncultured.

03:20.380 --> 03:22.290
Now stop saying that!
- Okay, okay.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.670
It's probably not the best place
for a girl like you anyway.

03:26.670 --> 03:29.210
- That's not fair.
- What's not fair?

03:29.210 --> 03:31.620

05:50.540 --> 05:53.960
This is where the old
Dixie Tabernacle used to be.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.580
This big revival church.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.540
- That the Opry moved into

05:57.540 --> 05:59.330
when it got too big
for the Hillsboro,

05:59.330 --> 06:02.920
but before it moved into
the War Memorial Auditorium.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.670
- Well, you know the story of
the Opry's first super star?

06:05.670 --> 06:07.540
- Uh, well, you want me to say

06:07.540 --> 06:09.830
it was Roy Acuff or Bill Monroe,

06:09.830 --> 06:12.580
but only so you can
tell me I'm wrong.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.080
- DeFord Bailey,

06:14.080 --> 06:15.750
this pint-sized black dude

06:15.750 --> 06:17.830
who played the meanest
harmonica that ever was.

06:17.830 --> 06:20.790
I mean, radio audiences
went crazy for him,

06:20.790 --> 06:22.540
but...that was because

06:22.540 --> 06:24.330
they didn't know
what they couldn't see.

06:24.330 --> 06:25.920
When the Opry started touring,
it became a problem.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.250
Band used to sneak him
up into their hotel rooms

06:28.250 --> 06:30.380
in a big suitcase.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.880
I'm not kidding.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.080
The Opry ended up firing him.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.040
Man worked the whole rest
of his life as a shoe shine.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
- Why do you like all
this history so much?

06:43.880 --> 06:45.040
- I was, um...

06:45.040 --> 06:46.670
I was a bit wild,

06:46.670 --> 06:49.460
when I first went to live
with my mom's folks.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.000
So, my grandpa,
he got it in his head

06:51.000 --> 06:54.040
that teaching me to play
the guitar could...

06:54.040 --> 06:55.540
I dunno, instill some
discipline or something.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.170
On account of how things
went down with my mom.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.580
Pops, music...

07:03.580 --> 07:05.960
they were kind of my only
fixed points for a while.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.120
I should get you home.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.170
What? You are still under age.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.830
- Really?

07:28.620 --> 07:30.420
- And it is illegal,
the last time I checked.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.120
- Okay, right.
And us trespassing.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.460
It's totally legal.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.000
- Hey...

07:36.000 --> 07:37.290
don't make this harder
than it already is.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.120

- Cut!

08:27.000 --> 08:28.210
- What's up?

08:28.210 --> 08:29.380
- I feel really weird.

08:29.380 --> 08:30.500
- Why is that?

08:30.500 --> 08:32.330
- Um, maybe it would help

08:32.330 --> 08:34.040
if I knew why I was doing
what I'm doing.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.250
- Each of us has two masters.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.540
One is cool and rational,
you know.

08:39.540 --> 08:41.000
You do X to get Y,
etc., etc...

08:41.000 --> 08:43.330
Then the other is darker,

08:43.330 --> 08:46.750
pleasure seeking, destructive.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.120
So what you're doing
is you're transgressing

08:49.120 --> 08:51.670
for no other reason than
because you get off on it.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.540
- I'm trying.
I promise you I'm trying.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.580
- So how's this?

08:55.580 --> 08:57.040
What would you do to people

08:57.040 --> 08:59.580
if there were no consequences?

08:59.580 --> 09:03.000
- Probably the same thing
I do now, honestly.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.380
- I think you can
dig deeper than that.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.420
Find the thrill in it, okay?

09:08.420 --> 09:09.880
- Okay.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.790
- Okay. So going again.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.330
Let's reset!

09:16.040 --> 09:17.500
- You, uh, you wanted to see me?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.170
- Yeah, come in, Randall.
Have a seat.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.120
We were hoping that
you could explain this.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.210
(crying)

09:35.210 --> 09:36.420
So you did take it?

09:36.420 --> 09:38.290
- I'm so sorry.

09:38.290 --> 09:40.830
I just wanted something

09:40.830 --> 09:43.080
that was special to her.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.830
- And the letters
and the flowers?

09:47.040 --> 09:48.580
You thought you were
in love with her?

09:48.580 --> 09:49.880
So you sent her
a bunch of letters.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.330
You sent her flowers, right?

09:56.290 --> 09:58.710
- I don't understand.

09:58.710 --> 10:03.290
I just wanted a souvenir
for my mom.

10:03.290 --> 10:04.710
I swear,
she's your biggest fan.

10:04.710 --> 10:08.290
And I just wanted her
to think that...

10:08.290 --> 10:10.080
we were friends.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.120
- So you didn't
send me anything?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.880
- Why would I send you anything?

10:16.880 --> 10:20.580
I stole. I'm so ashamed.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.830
Miss Jaymes, if I could
take it back...

10:23.830 --> 10:26.380
I'm so sorry.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.670
- I'm gonna say a sentence,
Randall.

10:32.670 --> 10:33.880
And I want you to write
it down, okay?

10:33.880 --> 10:35.250
- Okay.
- All right.

10:35.250 --> 10:39.120
"Their friends are
sitting over there."

10:49.580 --> 10:51.500
Wait outside for
a second, please?

10:56.330 --> 10:58.670
- It's not him.
- Uh-uh.

10:58.670 --> 10:59.670
Handwriting's different.

10:59.670 --> 11:02.120
Plus, our guy could not get

11:02.120 --> 11:04.500
his their, they're and there
straight to save his life.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.080
- Aren't you the budding
detective?

11:06.080 --> 11:08.040
- Yeah. I missed my calling.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.080
Want me to report a theft?

11:09.080 --> 11:11.080
- What? For that? No.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.670
I don't think he should work
here anymore, though.

11:12.670 --> 11:13.960
- Agreed.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.330
- This is freaking
me out, Bucky.

11:16.330 --> 11:18.170
I mean, that one
we got yesterday?

11:18.170 --> 11:20.380
That was creepy.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.880
How many is it now?

11:21.880 --> 11:23.250
- Four or five.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.540
- I mean, this guy's
not going away.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.580
He's scaring the hell out of me.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.540
I feel completely exposed.

11:29.540 --> 11:30.750
- I know.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.880
- Why couldn't it
just have been Randall?

11:35.880 --> 11:39.040
(guitar playing)

11:45.750 --> 11:47.880
- You writing something new?

11:47.880 --> 11:49.210
- Yeah, I'm trying to.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.790
- Is it for your
new boyfriend?

11:50.790 --> 11:52.170
- Don't know what
you're talking about.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.790
- Come on.

11:53.790 --> 11:54.960
Because you sound completely
normal on the phone?

11:54.960 --> 11:56.620
"Hey Clay. What's up?"

11:56.620 --> 11:57.620
- Stop it.

11:57.620 --> 11:58.960
(phone rings)

11:58.960 --> 12:00.460
- Oh, is that him?

12:00.460 --> 12:01.540
- Get out.
- Answer!

12:01.540 --> 12:03.080
- No, no, answer!
- Get out!

12:03.080 --> 12:04.380
- Please answer. I want to hear!

12:04.380 --> 12:05.830
Please?
- Shhh.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.960
(phone ringing continues)

12:07.960 --> 12:09.250
(sighs)

12:11.920 --> 12:13.290
Hey, what's up?

12:13.290 --> 12:15.670
- Uh, nothing.
What's up with you?

12:15.670 --> 12:18.210
- Nothing. I'm just wondering
why you're calling.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.670
You know, since I'm such
a baby and all.

12:19.670 --> 12:22.120
- Come on, Maddie.
We're friends.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.250
- Right. Friends.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.580
- Look, what are
you really doing?

12:26.580 --> 12:29.120
- Well, if you must know,
I was just writing.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.920
- Well, dang,
you gotta play it now.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.750
- No!
- Oh, come on! Why not?

12:33.750 --> 12:35.460
- Because it's not even
close to finished.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.960
- Well, how are you ever
gonna get it there

12:36.960 --> 12:38.040
if you don't play it for people?

12:38.040 --> 12:39.670
Please?

12:40.790 --> 12:42.380
- This is so embarrassing.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.420
- Just pretend like
I'm not even here.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.830
- Okay.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.420
I can't hear it this way.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.880
- What are you saying?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.420
- Oh, hey, where you going?

13:17.420 --> 13:19.710
- I'm going out to meet a boy.

13:19.710 --> 13:21.960
- Okay, um...

13:21.960 --> 13:23.000
What's his name?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.380
- Clay. He's a musician.

- Is it?

13:28.290 --> 13:30.460
- Where'd you meet him?
Work or...

13:30.460 --> 13:32.080
- Mom, dad, I love you.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.750
- Well, we love you too.
- We love you.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.540
- That's why we're so curious
about your life,

13:35.540 --> 13:37.880

and all the things...

13:37.880 --> 13:39.830

13:40.960 --> 13:42.580
- Okay.
- 'Kay.

13:42.580 --> 13:43.790
- Have fun.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.960
- Not too much.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.830
- Okay. You guys have fun too.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.290
- Which car you want
to follow her in?

13:55.540 --> 13:57.170
- No! Like you're
actually trying

13:57.170 --> 13:59.210
to hit him in the head!

13:59.210 --> 14:00.880
(music playing)

14:00.880 --> 14:02.750
Grab her!

14:02.750 --> 14:04.290
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.580
Keep rolling.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.880
Is that you being angry?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.210
- What?

14:10.210 --> 14:11.670
- Do you even know
what angry means?

14:11.670 --> 14:14.000
Show it to me.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.290
Jesus Christ!
I have seen Buddhist monks

14:15.290 --> 14:16.790
with bigger tempers than you!

14:16.790 --> 14:18.670
- I don't know how to do
what you want me do!

14:18.670 --> 14:20.330
- There it is.

14:20.330 --> 14:21.830
Now don't let him win.

14:21.830 --> 14:23.210
And don't you dare
go easy on her.

14:24.670 --> 14:25.670
We're still rolling. Go!

14:25.670 --> 14:26.830
(music resumes playing)

14:28.960 --> 14:31.080
- Get off me!

14:31.080 --> 14:32.250
(screams)

14:33.420 --> 14:36.460
- Yes! Cut!

14:36.460 --> 14:38.710
That's a wrap on today.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.250
You...

14:41.920 --> 14:43.420
You were amazing.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.210
And as for you...

14:45.210 --> 14:47.040
- Maybe a bag of ice?

14:47.040 --> 14:48.460
- Let me go one better.

14:48.460 --> 14:51.380
Can I stand you both
to a Tennessee Whiskey?

14:51.380 --> 14:52.880
- Think I need to
lay down a spell.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.080
- What about you, Gunnar?
Can I tempt you?

14:56.080 --> 14:58.290
- Well, as long as
it's cool with Scarlett.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.120
- Why would I care?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.670
- Great.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.120
So show me the way
to the next whiskey bar.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.500
- Oh, don't ask why.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.120
- A friend of mine owns it.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.040
I help him out
with this and that,

15:26.040 --> 15:27.830
so at nights,

15:27.830 --> 15:30.000
he lets me mess around
on my own stuff.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.670
- But you live here?

15:31.670 --> 15:34.620
- Uh...I started logging in
so much time here.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.620
It kind of felt wasteful to pay
for a whole other place.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.460

Let's slow down.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.420
- I don't wanna slow down.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.920
- Look, I'm sorry. I just...

16:49.920 --> 16:51.790
- I won't tell anyone.

16:51.790 --> 16:54.210
- No...

16:54.210 --> 16:56.080
Look, you don't know
what you're doing with me.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.540
- Clay, I'm not a virgin...

16:57.540 --> 16:59.500
- No, that's not
what I'm saying.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.830
- Okay. What are
you saying then?

17:00.830 --> 17:02.250
- I just--I think

17:02.250 --> 17:04.000
we should get to know
each other better.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.880
- That's what we are doing,
aren't we?

17:05.880 --> 17:07.120
Getting to know each other?

17:07.120 --> 17:08.380
- I think we're tiptoeing around

17:08.380 --> 17:09.460
the bigger issue here.

17:09.460 --> 17:10.710
- What issue?

17:10.710 --> 17:12.250
- That you're white and I'm...

17:12.250 --> 17:14.500
- Really? That?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
- Yeah, that.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.580
- I don't even see what
that has to do with anything.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.290
- Look, the fact that you can't
see what I'm talking about,

17:22.290 --> 17:23.880
that's a part of the problem.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.330
- Clay, I'm not saying
it's not real.

17:25.330 --> 17:27.540
I'm just saying
people do it every day.

17:27.540 --> 17:28.830
It's not that hard, you know.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.830
- Look, how can you
even say that?

17:30.830 --> 17:32.880
I mean, how can you
know anything?

17:32.880 --> 17:34.460
You grew up in your big house.

17:34.460 --> 17:35.790
And you're gonna tell me
how the world works?

17:41.880 --> 17:44.380
Look, I'm--I'm sorry.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.420
I'm just tired.

17:48.420 --> 17:49.880
I think I should just
call you tomorrow.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.250
Is that okay?
- Yeah.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.710
- Look...it's a great song.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.080
- Thank you.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.250
- Really.
- Thank you.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.500
- Let's just talk
about it tomorrow.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.830
- Yeah.

18:15.330 --> 18:16.830
- One, two, three, cheers.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.000
- Cheers.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.080
Oh! (coughs)

18:21.080 --> 18:22.540
- Come on, man. Buck up!

18:22.540 --> 18:24.210
In London, we call
this a warmup.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.880
- Yeah, in Tennessee,

18:25.880 --> 18:28.000
we call it sipping whiskey
for a reason.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.750
- I'll let you in
on a dirty secret.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.500
Every British boy grows up

18:32.500 --> 18:33.880
wanting to be
an American cowboy.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.290
Everything I know,
I learned when I was 14,

18:36.290 --> 18:38.540
and ditching class to watch
the latest American release.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.830
- Hmm. Like what?

18:40.830 --> 18:44.620
- The thrill of cinema
is voyeurism.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.330
You don't pay
to watch people act.

18:46.330 --> 18:48.580
You pay to watch them
bare their souls.

18:48.580 --> 18:50.420
It's my job as a director
to elicit that.

18:53.290 --> 18:55.670
Your girlfriend...no, wait.

18:55.670 --> 18:58.000
Is she your girlfriend?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.920
- Yeah. Well, I mean,
I guess you can say

19:00.920 --> 19:02.380
we're working
through some stuff.

19:02.380 --> 19:03.710
- Let me guess.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.250
You found a way to be a duffer,

19:05.250 --> 19:06.460
and screw it up.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.830
Or am I projecting?

19:07.830 --> 19:10.000
- Yeah, there was
a woman on tour.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.920
I messed up.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.420
- Why is it so easy for us

19:13.420 --> 19:14.670
to mess up something
that's working?

19:14.670 --> 19:16.920
- I know. I have no clue.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.380
You know, with Scarlett,
it's like...

19:19.380 --> 19:22.460
where would I be
if she wasn't with me?

19:22.460 --> 19:24.000
And if I hadn't convinced her

19:24.000 --> 19:26.290
to put her stuff to music,
and get up on stage?

19:27.670 --> 19:29.790
- Has she forgiven you?

19:29.790 --> 19:31.580
- Are you kidding?
She's like a saint.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.380
She's almost too forgiving.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.830
- What do you mean?

19:34.830 --> 19:37.500
- I mean, she never
thinks about herself.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.380
So much so that, well...

19:40.380 --> 19:41.960
- It gives you license
to be selfish?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.790
- Sometimes, yeah.

19:54.250 --> 19:55.620
- (burps)

20:07.790 --> 20:09.960
- Oh, your breath
is like 100 proof.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.670
- Mm, you feel nice.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.210
- Well, I have to be up
in five hours,

20:14.210 --> 20:16.080
and I haven't slept, so...

20:16.080 --> 20:19.080
- Maybe I can help.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.670
- Okay, I can't make love

20:20.670 --> 20:22.250
when I'm anxious about
pretending to make love

20:22.250 --> 20:23.620
on camera tomorrow.

But in fact,
there have been female artists

21:37.040 --> 21:39.290
from Isadora Duncan to Madonna

21:39.290 --> 21:41.330
who have claimed
power and pleasure

21:41.330 --> 21:44.000
by embracing their sexuality
on their own terms.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.830
So what I need you to do,

21:46.830 --> 21:48.500
is to quiet the voice
in your head

21:48.500 --> 21:50.750
that says "shame."

21:50.750 --> 21:53.120
And just own it, okay?

21:55.620 --> 21:56.880
- What if I don't want to?

21:58.710 --> 21:59.750
- How's that?

21:59.750 --> 22:01.080
- This is a music video.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.000
It's not a therapy session.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.460
I'm sick of you treating me
like it's the other way around.

22:04.460 --> 22:05.580
- Why can't it be both?

22:05.580 --> 22:06.920
- Because you're not a shrink!

22:06.920 --> 22:08.290
You're just some dude

22:08.290 --> 22:09.580
with screwed-up views

22:09.580 --> 22:11.330
about women all being
secret sexpots,

22:11.330 --> 22:14.500
and it's your spiritual journey
to awaken all of us.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.580
- Tomato, tomatoe.

22:15.580 --> 22:16.920
We are going again. Back to one!

22:16.920 --> 22:18.620
- Is it because you're a man,

22:18.620 --> 22:21.040
you think you can manipulate
and diagnose everybody?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.920
Or is it because you grew up
rich and privileged?

22:22.920 --> 22:25.120
And you think everybody else
is simple and repressed?

22:25.120 --> 22:26.830
- Take your pick!
We're going again!

22:26.830 --> 22:28.710
- No! We're moving on.
You got plenty.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.250
- Everything we have done today
is worthless!

22:36.460 --> 22:38.080
In fact, Raymond...

22:38.080 --> 22:39.250
delete the card.

22:41.670 --> 22:43.580
- You wouldn't.

22:43.580 --> 22:44.750
- Go on. Do it.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.880
There. It's all gone.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.960
Hopefully, now you're ready
to give me something real.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.120
- He's nuts.
He's completely nuts.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.380
- He's not nuts.
He's just passionate.

23:14.380 --> 23:16.380
- Is that what you learned
on your man date?

23:16.380 --> 23:18.290
- If you didn't want me to go,
you should have just said so.

23:18.290 --> 23:19.540
- Oh, as if I needed to give him

23:19.540 --> 23:20.670
any more ammunition
to throw at me!

23:20.670 --> 23:22.380
- (sighs)

23:22.380 --> 23:23.710
- What?

23:23.710 --> 23:24.880
Please, go on.
Everyone else is.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.750
- Nothing. It's just...

23:26.750 --> 23:29.380
maybe it's okay
to push the envelope.

23:29.380 --> 23:31.460
There's no harm
in cutting loose.

23:31.460 --> 23:32.670
- Why? So I could be like

23:32.670 --> 23:33.790
one of the girls
in your fantasies?

23:33.790 --> 23:35.790
- No...

23:35.790 --> 23:37.620
So you can feel more free.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.170
- If you're so concerned
about my freedom,

23:39.170 --> 23:40.670
why would you push me
to be somebody I'm not?

23:40.670 --> 23:43.420
I'm okay with who I am, Gunnar,

23:43.420 --> 23:45.120
I work too much.
I care about other people.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.120
I'm good to my family
and the people I love.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.380
Even people I don't like,
I'm nice to them too.

23:48.380 --> 23:49.330
And I'm okay with that.

23:49.330 --> 23:50.710
I need you to be okay
with it too.

23:50.710 --> 23:51.920
- I am okay with that,

23:51.920 --> 23:53.420
I promise.

23:53.420 --> 23:55.210
And you know what?
If you want to walk away,

23:55.210 --> 23:56.670
I will support that.

23:56.670 --> 23:58.250
But if you want my advice,

23:58.250 --> 23:59.540
I think you should
just gut it out.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.500
- Not everything I say or do

24:05.500 --> 24:07.500
is going to make complete sense.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.420
Like you said,
it's a music video.

24:09.420 --> 24:10.880
The logic isn't linear.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.210
It's emotional and
free-associative.

24:13.210 --> 24:15.920
And there is method
in my madness.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.620
I just need you
to trust me enough

24:17.620 --> 24:18.960
to give in to it.

25:02.670 --> 25:05.040
- Four, five...

25:05.040 --> 25:06.710
- I'm sorry,
I should have called

25:06.710 --> 25:08.120
before just like dropping in.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.250
Is there a better time
I could come back?

25:10.250 --> 25:11.790
- Are you kidding me?

25:11.790 --> 25:13.710
All I want is an excuse

25:13.710 --> 25:15.960
not to focus on
my miserable self.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.210
Look at this, though.

25:19.830 --> 25:21.380
- That's incredible!

25:21.380 --> 25:23.420
- What's incredible
is this ugly beast

25:23.420 --> 25:26.040
is finally gonna come off
next week.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.580
Tell me you have something
more exciting to talk about.

25:28.580 --> 25:29.580
Sit.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.960
- Well, there's a boy.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.790
- I'm hooked already.

25:33.790 --> 25:36.380
- And he's like amazing.

25:36.380 --> 25:39.000
So sweet, but also
challenges me.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.500
And if you could
hear him sing...

25:41.500 --> 25:43.540
- I'm waiting for the catch.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.210
- Well, there isn't one really.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.880
It's just every time I feel like

25:46.880 --> 25:48.670
we're taking a step forward,

25:48.670 --> 25:50.620
he like clams up or something.

25:50.620 --> 25:52.170
And he just keeps saying

25:52.170 --> 25:54.120
I don't know what
I'm getting myself into.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.290
And last night,
he was mean for no reason.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.670
- Then you should take him
at face value and move on.

25:59.670 --> 26:01.460
Maddie, if a guy's
not treating you right,

26:01.460 --> 26:03.540
that doesn't mean that
there's some sweeter,

26:03.540 --> 26:05.620
nicer version of him
under there,

26:05.620 --> 26:07.620
and it's your job
to try to find him.

26:07.620 --> 26:08.880
Trust me.
I've been down that road

26:08.880 --> 26:10.830
too many times to count.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.710
- If it's so obvious, then...

26:12.710 --> 26:13.880
why have you done it
so many times?

26:16.420 --> 26:18.330
- Because screwed-up men
are sexy.

26:18.330 --> 26:20.420
Don't ask me why.

26:20.420 --> 26:21.750
Until they're not.

26:21.750 --> 26:24.250
Look...

26:24.250 --> 26:26.960
you don't have to make every
mistake by yourself.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.000
Let me feel like
a couple of mine

26:29.000 --> 26:32.420

26:57.210 --> 26:58.420
- Oh, dude, check it out.

26:58.420 --> 27:00.040
Hey! Hey, buddy!

27:00.040 --> 27:01.250
Play "She Thinks
My Tractor's Sexy"!

27:02.880 --> 27:04.000

27:04.000 --> 27:05.380
- You ain't got to lie, man.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.750
Everybody knows it.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.290
Tell you what.
It's $20 in it for you.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.620
- Well, you saying our money's
no good here?

27:12.620 --> 27:14.420
- No, I'm saying,
it's a crap song.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.830
(laughter)

27:16.830 --> 27:19.620
- What's your problem, huh?

27:19.620 --> 27:22.750
You think you're better than us?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.250
What you looking at?

27:31.380 --> 27:33.250
- You know, we're gonna be
doing one of these

27:33.250 --> 27:35.460
for you and Deacon soon enough.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.210
In fact, we should
make sure we get a bunch

27:37.210 --> 27:39.670
of behind-the-scenes,
making the album stuff as well.

27:39.670 --> 27:41.250
- You're a crazy person.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.670
- You know it.

27:42.670 --> 27:44.540
- Okay, we're rolling!

27:44.540 --> 27:45.960
Phones off and voices down!

27:49.380 --> 27:51.420
And play back!

28:12.500 --> 28:14.460
- Oh, hi, Rayna.
- Hey.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.540
- How you doing?

28:15.540 --> 28:17.330
- I'm okay. You doing all right?

28:17.330 --> 28:20.170
- Uh, yeah, just
takes me a minute

28:20.170 --> 28:23.210
to switch back
and forth, is all.

28:23.210 --> 28:24.960
- Scarlett?
- Yeah?

28:24.960 --> 28:26.330
- Can we borrow you
for a second?

28:26.330 --> 28:27.620
- Yes.

28:27.620 --> 28:28.710
Excuse me.

28:28.710 --> 28:29.750
I'll be back in a minute.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.170
- Okay.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.580
Hey...

28:36.580 --> 28:39.420
I think something's
upsetting Scarlett.

28:39.420 --> 28:40.420
- What's the matter?

28:40.420 --> 28:42.460
- I don't know.

28:42.460 --> 28:46.080
I mean, she's a really
sensitive girl, I just--

28:46.080 --> 28:49.040
I wonder if Damien's pushing her
a little too hard or something.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.170
- Rayna, if Scarlett
was in the studio,

28:51.170 --> 28:53.880
would you barge in and demand
that she change her process

28:53.880 --> 28:55.580
in the middle of a song?
- I hear what you're saying...

28:55.580 --> 28:57.000
Maybe I would if the producer

28:57.000 --> 28:59.040
was being abusive
to her, you know.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.790
- Look, Damien is unorthodox.

29:01.790 --> 29:04.170
But he's a puppy dog deep down.
Trust me.

29:04.170 --> 29:06.000
- I get that. I just--

29:06.000 --> 29:07.380
I know Scarlett and I--

29:07.380 --> 29:09.080
- And I know Damien.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.210
And I've seen the performances
he's elicited.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.420
Sure, granted, yeah,
he is on the edge,

29:13.420 --> 29:14.580
but it's just--

29:14.580 --> 29:17.710
it's part of his genius.

29:17.710 --> 29:20.040
You just gotta give him
the freedom to do his thing.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.710
Okay? Trust me.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.380
(phone ringing)

29:27.380 --> 29:29.460
- Hey, you missed me.
Leave a message.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.080
If people still do that
or whatever. (beep)

29:35.040 --> 29:36.750
(knock on door)

29:36.750 --> 29:38.040
- Clay, you in there?

29:38.040 --> 29:39.790
- Maddie, turn around
and go home!

29:43.750 --> 29:47.830
- My God! What happened? Clay?
- I'm fine, I'm--

29:47.830 --> 29:50.710
- Oh, my god.
(dialing cell phone)

29:52.540 --> 29:53.670
Clay!

29:53.670 --> 29:55.580
- 911. What's your emergency?

30:09.460 --> 30:11.920
- Hey, I want to check
on the status of a patient.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.250
His name's Clayton Carter.
(text message rings)

30:13.250 --> 30:14.420
- Are you a spouse
or family member?

30:16.920 --> 30:19.290
- Um, I'm the one
who brought him here.

30:19.290 --> 30:21.170
- You're just gonna have to wait
till he's released, ma'am.

30:26.830 --> 30:28.670
- Thank God!

30:28.670 --> 30:30.210
Fellow exile.

30:30.210 --> 30:31.830
Damien's a real cell phone Nazi,

30:31.830 --> 30:34.040
and I had a lot of business
to handle on mine.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.580
How'd you misbehave?

30:35.580 --> 30:38.500
- Apparently, they're filming
something sensitive.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.920
I'm Will.
- I know who you are.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.040
You do what a lot of these
young guys out there can't.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.210
You sing from the heart.

30:47.210 --> 30:49.170
- I don't know
about that, but...

30:49.170 --> 30:50.880
- I'm Zach Welles, I'm
a business partner of Rayna's.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.830
- Oh, then I know
who you are too.

30:53.830 --> 30:56.420
- Hey, listen--what's Luke
got you doing at Wheelin'?

30:56.420 --> 30:58.540
- Opening up for him.

30:58.540 --> 31:01.420
- Right, but what's his
overall vision?

31:01.420 --> 31:05.420
- Uh, I guess just get
the music out there.

31:05.420 --> 31:10.040
- Yeah. If only that was
what it was all about, right?

31:10.040 --> 31:12.580
You know, I am friendly with
the arts editor at the Times.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.380
I'm sure he would eat it up
if I pitched you as a feature.

31:15.380 --> 31:17.750
And they'd be smart
and sober about it,

31:17.750 --> 31:19.250
because, well, it's the Times.

31:19.250 --> 31:22.040
When will you be
in New York next?

31:22.040 --> 31:25.330
- Uh, look,
I'm flattered, but...

31:27.330 --> 31:29.080
- Sorry.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.210
Tend to get carried away
when I'm excited.

31:31.210 --> 31:34.460
Here, let me see your phone.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.500
There...

31:36.500 --> 31:38.960
Now you have my number.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.040
Feel free to use it.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.080
- Okay, thanks. I will.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.250
- Great.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.460
I wonder what they're
shooting up there, right?

31:48.540 --> 31:49.790
- Why not?

31:49.790 --> 31:50.960
- Because I don't understand why

31:50.960 --> 31:52.750
I would do something like that.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.500
- Because just before you're
about to make love to him,

31:54.500 --> 31:56.960
you get an idea to tease him,
and put on a show.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.380
And we watch your face
in pure pleasure

31:59.380 --> 32:02.830
as you torture him
until he realizes he loves it.

32:02.830 --> 32:05.040
- Well, I'm sorry, but
I'm not comfortable with that.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.880
- You see,

32:06.880 --> 32:08.670
if you had some sort of
philosophical objection

32:08.670 --> 32:11.290
or point you wanted to make

32:11.290 --> 32:13.000
or idea you wanted to share,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.500
I wouldn't mind
that you fight me.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
But, no, you do it
because you're afraid!

32:16.500 --> 32:18.330
And you waste everyone's time!

32:22.750 --> 32:24.580
Let me ask you as question.

32:24.580 --> 32:25.960
Why hasn't it happened for you?

32:25.960 --> 32:27.420
- Why hasn't what
happened for me?

32:27.420 --> 32:29.080
- Why weren't you famous?

32:29.080 --> 32:30.620
- W-what...?
- Let me put it a different way.

32:30.620 --> 32:32.830
Who was Billie Holiday?

32:32.830 --> 32:33.920
Johnny Cash? Tammy Wynette?

32:33.920 --> 32:36.250
Because it wasn't their voices,

32:36.250 --> 32:38.210
and it sure as hell
wasn't their manners!

32:38.210 --> 32:40.210
It was about taking
all your pain,

32:40.210 --> 32:42.170
all your desire,

32:42.170 --> 32:43.880
and laying it bare.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.380
So if you're just standing there

32:45.380 --> 32:46.750
because that guy said,

32:46.750 --> 32:49.040
don't just write poetry, sing,

32:49.040 --> 32:50.750
and you were like,
aw, shucks, if you say so,

32:50.750 --> 32:52.420
then you should just quit now!

32:52.420 --> 32:53.710
Go back to writing
your big feelings

32:53.710 --> 32:55.210
in a little notebook,

32:55.210 --> 32:56.880
and letting people
treat you like a doormat!

32:56.880 --> 32:58.460
- You realize you're
the only person treating me

32:58.460 --> 32:59.580
like a doormat right now?

32:59.580 --> 33:01.670
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

33:01.670 --> 33:03.620
- All right, all right.
Just give it a rest, man.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.620
- Tell me, are you
or are you not

33:05.620 --> 33:07.790
the woman who apologizes when
she hasn't done anything wrong?

33:07.790 --> 33:11.170
Who smiles, when what she's
really feeling is angry?

33:11.170 --> 33:13.120
Who takes back her man?

33:13.120 --> 33:14.960
Who folds his socks?

33:14.960 --> 33:16.380
When he slept with
half of Nashville?

33:16.380 --> 33:17.620
- All right, leave off her!
I mean it!

33:21.250 --> 33:25.080
- Go ahead. Walk away.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.330
Just know what life
you're choosing when you do it.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.290
- Scarlett, if you want to get
out of here right now...

33:29.290 --> 33:30.460
- Why can't both of you
just shut up!

33:36.500 --> 33:37.710
- All right, then.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.540
Let's roll camera.

33:44.460 --> 33:48.620

34:11.830 --> 34:13.330
You're gonna find him
over your shoulder.

34:13.330 --> 34:15.080
Keep coming this way.
Keep coming this way!

34:15.080 --> 34:16.620
Yeah, float past her...

34:16.620 --> 34:18.170
Come on. Come on.

34:18.170 --> 34:21.540
Look right on you! Come on!

34:21.540 --> 34:22.750
Look at her!
How's she making you feel?

34:29.580 --> 34:31.500
- Oh my God, you okay?

34:34.250 --> 34:35.420
- Yeah.

34:38.540 --> 34:40.000
Come on. Let's go.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.170
It's getting late.

34:44.330 --> 34:45.460
- Is there anyone
you want to call?

34:45.460 --> 34:46.880
Like maybe someone who could

34:46.880 --> 34:47.960
stay with you or something?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.170
- Look, I don't need anyone

34:49.170 --> 34:51.040
to look after me, all right?

34:51.040 --> 34:52.460
- Okay, um...

34:52.460 --> 34:53.790
Well, can I at least
give you a ride?

34:53.790 --> 34:56.210
- Look, I said I'm good.

34:56.210 --> 34:57.880
- Are you kidding?

34:57.880 --> 34:59.250
What is wrong?

34:59.250 --> 35:01.960
- Lots of things, all right?

35:01.960 --> 35:03.250
Which is why you're
gonna go and do you.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.710
And I'm gonna do me, all right?

35:04.710 --> 35:07.380
- No. I've had a lot
of time to think,

35:07.380 --> 35:08.710
and I'm sorry,
but I'm not doing that.

35:08.710 --> 35:11.000
- Look, Maddie,
don't you get it?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.250
Okay, I'm not a normal person.

35:13.250 --> 35:14.790
- What do you mean?

35:14.790 --> 35:17.880
Just talk to me, Clay!

35:17.880 --> 35:19.960
- Look, I get...

35:22.880 --> 35:25.420
I get mood swings, you know.

35:25.420 --> 35:27.710
Like big ones.

35:27.710 --> 35:30.960
- You're bipolar.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.250
- Well, how'd you know that?

35:33.250 --> 35:35.580
- Like half my friends think
they got a mood disorder.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.120
- Yeah, well,
let's hope they don't.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.170
- Clay, there are things
you can do, you know...

35:39.170 --> 35:40.790
- I know...
- Medicine you can take.

35:40.790 --> 35:43.460
- Look, Maddie, I can't
take that stuff, okay?

35:43.460 --> 35:46.750
I can't feel when I'm on it.

35:46.750 --> 35:49.120
I can't write, I can't sing.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.250
I just--I can't!

35:50.250 --> 35:53.120
- Okay. I don't care.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.960
- You say that now, but...

35:55.960 --> 35:57.620
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

35:57.620 --> 35:59.960
I'm sorry I led you on.

36:01.750 --> 36:03.460
- You're just scared!
- Yeah?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.620
- Yeah.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.790
Yeah, and you can say

36:05.790 --> 36:06.920
it's because I'm too young,

36:06.920 --> 36:08.170
or I'm white and your black,

36:08.170 --> 36:09.210
or you get depressed
or whatever.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.580
But deep down,

36:10.580 --> 36:11.830
you know it's
because you like me,

36:11.830 --> 36:13.540
and that terrifies you.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.000
- Where do you see
this going, huh?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.710
I mean, what do you
want to happen?

36:16.710 --> 36:18.540
You want me to walk up
to your parents' front door?

36:18.540 --> 36:20.250
Say hi, mom. Hi, dad.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.620
I'm your daughter's
broke-ass older boyfriend.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.620
And, oh, by the way,
I'm off my meds!

36:24.620 --> 36:26.830
Nice to meet you!
- Yes!

36:26.830 --> 36:28.250
Yes, that's exactly what I want!

36:28.250 --> 36:29.290
Because you're brilliant!

36:29.290 --> 36:31.920
And I care so much about you!

36:31.920 --> 36:34.250
And the only thing
holding you back is you!

36:36.830 --> 36:38.000
- I'm gonna go.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.500
- And now her hand
comes up into frame.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.830
Slow. Grasp his fingers.

36:55.830 --> 36:58.790
That's it. Cut.

36:58.790 --> 37:00.170
Okay, gang, that's a wrap.

37:00.170 --> 37:01.500
(cheering)

37:07.170 --> 37:08.330
(knock)

37:10.290 --> 37:12.250
- I imagine you more or less
want to murder me right now,

37:12.250 --> 37:14.250
but I couldn't leave
without telling you

37:14.250 --> 37:15.920
how incredible you've been.

37:18.460 --> 37:21.330
In any case, I see really bright
things for you in the future.

37:21.330 --> 37:23.250
I'll just be happy to say
I knew her when.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.880
- What gives you the nerve
to treat people like that?

37:34.830 --> 37:36.670
- Wait till you see the video.

37:43.790 --> 37:45.170
(knocking on door)

37:45.170 --> 37:47.540
- Maddie? Mom wants
you for breakfast.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.880
- Okay.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.540
- What's wrong?

37:53.540 --> 37:56.290
- Nothing, um...

37:56.290 --> 37:57.460
Just tell her I'm not coming.

37:59.830 --> 38:01.080
- Okay.

38:11.670 --> 38:12.880
- Here she is.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.380
You sleep long enough?

38:14.380 --> 38:15.580
I made sweet and savory.

38:15.580 --> 38:16.830
So you don't have to choose.

38:16.830 --> 38:18.580
- Thanks.

38:18.580 --> 38:21.290
- Here's to that video
being behind us.

38:21.290 --> 38:23.460
Now it's just up to
Mr. self-proclaimed genius.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.500
You all right? What's wrong?

38:31.500 --> 38:32.880
- Why would you tell him
about our personal business?

38:36.540 --> 38:38.250
- He just asked
if we were dating,

38:38.250 --> 38:40.250
and I said it's complicated.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.580
- Gunnar, I've made my peace
with the past,

38:42.580 --> 38:45.500
but it doesn't mean I want
other people knowing about it.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.330
I'm ashamed of what
they might think of me.

38:47.330 --> 38:50.460
What a weak person I must be

38:50.460 --> 38:52.000
to keep on taking you back.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.330
- Okay, I'm--I'm sorry.

38:58.330 --> 38:59.960
But for what it's worth,

38:59.960 --> 39:02.080
I think you're dead wrong.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.080
I think you're so damn strong.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.960
And I'm thankful
for that every day.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.120
- We want to talk to you.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.170
- Why? You guys just been like

39:30.170 --> 39:31.460
lying in wait down here or...

39:31.460 --> 39:32.830
- No, but we were up
half the night

39:32.830 --> 39:33.960
till you got home.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.040
- Sorry. My phone died.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.540
- Well, you know,

39:36.540 --> 39:37.960
if we're gonna have
this new arrangement

39:37.960 --> 39:39.040
where we're treating you
like an adult,

39:39.040 --> 39:40.380
you gotta act like an adult.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.040
You know, it'd be courteous
for you to let us know

39:42.040 --> 39:43.250
where you're going.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.620
And then return
our text messages.

39:45.620 --> 39:47.170
You know, don't go
sneaking around and hiding.

39:47.170 --> 39:49.580
- Clay was in an accident.

39:49.580 --> 39:51.080
So I had to take him
to the hospital.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.540
- What? Is he okay?

39:52.540 --> 39:54.250
- Yeah, he's fine.

39:54.250 --> 39:55.710
I'm just saying
it's why I didn't text.

39:55.710 --> 39:57.170
- Okay, listen.

39:57.170 --> 39:58.710
- What?

39:58.710 --> 40:00.880
- We're just saying that
it makes it worse for us

40:00.880 --> 40:02.330
if you force us to use
our imagination...

40:02.330 --> 40:04.290
- Okay, I get it!
It was a bad decision.

40:04.290 --> 40:06.210
- Well, we want to know
that you're okay.

40:06.210 --> 40:08.710
And, you know, if you're
seeing a new guy,

40:08.710 --> 40:10.080
it would be nice for you
to introduce him to us.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.750
- Well, it's over now.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.330
So that's one less thing
to worry about, right?

40:13.330 --> 40:14.540
Could I please go now?

40:19.790 --> 40:21.080
(doorbell rings)

40:22.540 --> 40:25.040
- You expecting someone?
- No, I'm not.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.460
- Hello? How can I help you?
Who is this?

40:32.460 --> 40:34.960
- It's Clay Carter, sir.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.920
I'm Maddie's...friend.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.500
- Hello.

40:44.500 --> 40:48.830
- Hi...hello. Mr. Claybourne,
Ms Jaymes?

40:48.830 --> 40:52.290
I had the pleasure of getting
to know your daughter, Maddie.

40:52.290 --> 40:54.460
And I thought it was about time
I introduced myself.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.330
- Well, that's real nice.

40:59.330 --> 41:01.170
Thank you. Come on in.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.330
- So, um...

41:05.330 --> 41:07.670
Maddie says
you're a musician.

41:07.670 --> 41:09.710
- Aw, no. I mean,
not like y'all.

41:09.710 --> 41:11.880
But, yeah, country, blues...

41:19.790 --> 41:21.790
- How'd the numbers come out?

41:21.790 --> 41:24.380
- Uh, we came in 40 over.

41:24.380 --> 41:26.040
- (gasps) How'd that happen?

41:26.040 --> 41:27.460
- Overtime.

41:27.460 --> 41:30.080
Damien went long
every single day.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.670
Oh, and you were right
about Scarlett.

41:31.670 --> 41:33.710
Gunnar said something to me
about her being "livid"?

41:33.710 --> 41:34.960
- I need to give her
something...

41:34.960 --> 41:36.380
- See, I knew it.

41:36.380 --> 41:37.620
I should have
trusted my gut on that...

41:37.620 --> 41:39.330
- Rayna? Rayna?
So glad I found you!

41:39.330 --> 41:40.920
Have you got my letters?
- Sir, you can't go back there.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.120
- Rayna? Rayna, wait!
- Wait, calm down.

41:43.120 --> 41:44.120
I had a weird feeling
that you hadn't,

41:44.120 --> 41:45.330
So I just wanted to
see you myself...

41:45.330 --> 41:46.880
- Hey! Let's go outside!
- Get off of me!

41:46.880 --> 41:48.620
I just want to talk to her!

41:48.620 --> 41:49.830
Rayna, I just want to
talk to you, Rayna!

41:49.830 --> 41:50.920
I just want to talk to you!

41:50.920 --> 41:52.290
- Call 911. Call 911!

41:52.290 --> 41:54.250
- Rayna! I just wanna
talk to you!

41:54.250 --> 41:58.210
- I just wanna talk to you!
- Outside!
