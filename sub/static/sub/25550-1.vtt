Subtitles by explosiveskull

03:10.704 --> 03:11.705
Yeah.

03:11.707 --> 03:13.709
[INAUDIBLE], huh?

03:13.711 --> 03:13.912
Come on.

03:22.595 --> 03:23.762
Nice work.

03:23.764 --> 03:27.704
I knew you would dispatch
Carson and McNalley easily,

03:27.706 --> 03:28.909
but it was still fun to watch.

03:35.854 --> 03:38.093
Did you really think I would
let you leave without a fight?

03:41.699 --> 03:43.903
Go ahead.

03:43.905 --> 03:44.871
Maybe I'll miss.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.060
Come on.

03:56.062 --> 03:57.900
I know you're better than this.

04:20.512 --> 04:21.911
Really?

04:21.913 --> 04:23.782
Is this your idea of
a going-away party?

04:23.784 --> 04:24.584
I knew you'd love it.

04:24.586 --> 04:25.552
Oh.

04:25.554 --> 04:27.021
Dang, Alex.

04:27.023 --> 04:29.728
I think you gave
me a concussion.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.230
Are those my replacements?

04:31.232 --> 04:32.469
You're irreplaceable.

04:42.086 --> 04:45.826
You had blanks in here, right?

04:45.828 --> 04:47.696
Are you sure you're not
going to miss all of this?

04:47.698 --> 04:48.933
Yeah.

04:48.935 --> 04:51.002
I'm pretty sure I've had enough
excitement for one lifetime.

04:51.004 --> 04:52.574
Why don't you let me
know where you're going?

04:52.576 --> 04:53.776
I'll write you.

04:53.778 --> 04:56.247
Oh, Jeremiah,
you know if I told

04:56.249 --> 05:00.088
you that, I'd have to kill you.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.894
You know, I never
really did apologize.

05:02.896 --> 05:04.730
For what?

05:04.732 --> 05:07.302
I know what happened
in the Philippines.

05:07.304 --> 05:08.972
It changed things for you.

05:11.079 --> 05:13.014
It's fine.

05:13.016 --> 05:15.786
I've given a lot more pain
than I could ever receive.

05:15.788 --> 05:16.958
What are you gonna give now?

06:21.919 --> 06:24.388
Come on, now, show
me what you're working with.

06:24.390 --> 06:25.458
Go ahead.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.261
Give me just a little bit.

06:27.263 --> 06:29.466
You know I like the
way you move it.

06:29.468 --> 06:31.971
Come on, come on, get it on.

06:31.973 --> 06:34.376
Come on, girl, show me
what you're working with.

06:34.378 --> 06:35.980
AUTOMATED WOMAN'S VOICE
In 200 feet,

06:35.982 --> 06:38.152
turn left at Longdale Road.

06:43.395 --> 06:43.897
That's not right.

06:48.106 --> 06:49.440
AUTOMATED WOMAN'S VOICE
Rerouting.

06:49.442 --> 06:55.285
Continue on Highway
57 for 143 miles.

07:15.995 --> 07:17.295
Just
past the grain mill.

07:17.297 --> 07:18.467
Right at the stable.

07:33.429 --> 07:35.900
Hey!

07:35.902 --> 07:37.636
I was just about to call you.

07:37.638 --> 07:39.974
You
missed your deadline.

07:39.976 --> 07:42.077
Wait... is it the
first already now?

07:42.079 --> 07:44.549
30 days in September,
April, June, and Nov...

07:44.551 --> 07:46.119
my bad.

07:46.121 --> 07:48.524
I'll have the money to
you in a couple of days...

07:48.526 --> 07:53.266
a week, tops... maybe two.

07:53.268 --> 07:54.671
Have
you ever see the skin

07:54.673 --> 07:57.342
ripped off a man's hand...

07:57.344 --> 07:59.917
all the bones and the
tendons still writhing about?

08:02.487 --> 08:03.353
Nope.

08:03.355 --> 08:05.223
I can't say I have.

08:05.225 --> 08:05.895
One week.

08:27.336 --> 08:29.740
OK, showtime.

08:35.620 --> 08:37.155
Oh, sorry.

08:37.658 --> 08:39.225
Danny... yes.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.229
Your grandmother
said you'd be coming.

08:41.231 --> 08:43.167
Uh... yeah.

08:43.169 --> 08:45.170
We're... we're very close.

08:45.172 --> 08:45.506
Of course.

08:45.508 --> 08:47.676
Come in.

08:47.678 --> 08:48.080
She's upstairs.

08:53.155 --> 08:54.557
So how much time
do you think she has?

08:54.559 --> 08:57.362
I mean, how is she?

08:57.364 --> 08:58.832
It's hard to say...

08:58.834 --> 09:01.369
a few days or a few months.

09:01.371 --> 09:03.173
I don't know.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.676
Today's been one
of her good days.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.681
She's very lucid.

09:06.683 --> 09:08.216
I'm sure it helps
having family around.

09:08.218 --> 09:08.420
Oh.

09:13.362 --> 09:14.361
Look, Claire.

09:14.363 --> 09:16.768
Your grandson, Danny, is here.

09:16.770 --> 09:18.572
She's nearly deaf.

09:18.574 --> 09:19.674
Hi, Grammy.

09:19.676 --> 09:22.679
Uh, your nurse here says
that you're doing very good.

09:22.681 --> 09:23.848
I spoke to your doctor.

09:23.850 --> 09:26.253
He's very optimistic about
your most recent blood work.

09:26.255 --> 09:28.256
Oh, here, let me... let
me help you with that.

09:28.258 --> 09:29.325
Hey, these pillows are
a little bit small.

09:29.327 --> 09:31.663
She might be more
comfortable with bigger ones.

09:31.665 --> 09:32.566
Her heating pad is off.

09:32.568 --> 09:33.868
You must be cold.

09:35.340 --> 09:35.674
I'll go get that.

09:38.580 --> 09:39.446
All right.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.182
You can
cut the shit, boy.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.593
Grammy?

09:46.595 --> 09:48.632
Really?

09:48.634 --> 09:53.207
The only reason I didn't
have Alexandra there tell you

09:53.209 --> 09:55.578
to turn right around
and drive away

09:55.580 --> 09:59.519
is because the poor girl
hasn't been laid in years,

09:59.521 --> 10:03.594
and I thought you'd at
least be useful for that...

10:03.596 --> 10:09.874
the only useful skill you
inherited from your father.

10:09.876 --> 10:14.850
Your poor father
put so much time

10:14.852 --> 10:19.961
and money into you
only to see you

10:19.963 --> 10:27.407
disappoint him at every turn...

10:27.409 --> 10:31.586
probably what sent him
to such an early grave.

10:34.791 --> 10:40.034
I may be deaf, but
I'm not stupid.

10:40.036 --> 10:44.476
I know why you're here.

10:44.478 --> 10:51.290
I can only assume you've
burned through your trust fund.

10:51.292 --> 10:55.634
And here you are now playing
world's greatest grandson.

11:01.345 --> 11:09.024
It gives me great pleasure
to tell you that when I die,

11:09.026 --> 11:13.500
you will get nothing.

11:13.502 --> 11:17.976
While you may be my
last blood relative,

11:17.978 --> 11:25.859
technically, you are a
bastard, a painful remnant

11:25.861 --> 11:31.803
of my son's extramarital
affair with that harlot

11:31.805 --> 11:32.541
you call Mother.

11:35.780 --> 11:44.128
If you want to keep up the
charade, I can't stop you.

11:44.130 --> 11:50.578
But you are
wasting your time.

11:53.884 --> 11:54.619
Who's ready for some tea?

12:01.565 --> 12:03.834
Can't
breathe without you.

12:03.836 --> 12:06.105
Can't breathe without you.

12:06.107 --> 12:10.080
Can't breathe without you.

12:12.455 --> 12:14.956
Well, well, well,
look who it is.

12:16.830 --> 12:17.930
Hey.

12:17.932 --> 12:22.805
Hey, Seth and... well, um, hello.

12:22.807 --> 12:23.441
Wow.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.743
Good to... good to see you.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.745
Is it?

12:25.747 --> 12:26.646
Yeah.

12:26.648 --> 12:29.018
See, that surprises me.

12:29.020 --> 12:29.854
What are you doing around here?

12:29.856 --> 12:31.222
I'm just...

12:31.224 --> 12:33.961
I'm just visiting
my grandmother.

12:33.963 --> 12:34.929
How is she?

12:34.931 --> 12:36.098
She's still alive.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.603
Mm.

12:37.605 --> 12:38.571
So you're just being
the good ole grandson,

12:38.573 --> 12:39.939
just checking in on her, right?

12:39.941 --> 12:42.143
Yeah, pretty much.

12:42.145 --> 12:44.750
Now I kind of feel bad.

12:44.752 --> 12:47.855
See, I thought you came
back for all of her money.

12:47.857 --> 12:49.793
I remember when you were a
kid, all you used to talk about

12:49.795 --> 12:54.168
was that, um, that inheritance.

12:54.170 --> 12:58.310
But I guess you're just checking
in on her and all, right?

12:58.312 --> 12:59.813
Right.

12:59.815 --> 13:02.819
Is everything
OK here, gentlemen?

13:02.821 --> 13:05.858
Yes, everything here is great!

13:05.860 --> 13:06.661
Thanks for asking.

13:06.663 --> 13:07.930
I'm going to buy
this guy a drink.

13:07.932 --> 13:08.932
- Oh...
- No, no.

13:08.934 --> 13:10.199
You know what?

13:10.201 --> 13:11.169
Let's make it three.

13:11.171 --> 13:14.241
We might be here a while.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.212
Man, it is so good to see you.

13:16.214 --> 13:20.722
It is so good to see you.

13:20.724 --> 13:23.293
And
then, she's like,

13:23.295 --> 13:24.896
you're a disappointment
or some shit.

13:24.898 --> 13:26.065
And then she says,
you're not going

13:26.067 --> 13:27.936
to get a penny, which
is really messed

13:27.938 --> 13:29.839
up because I had plans for it.

13:29.841 --> 13:33.112
Probably just going to give it
to a stupid, bullshit charity.

13:33.114 --> 13:34.949
Probably.

13:34.951 --> 13:35.951
Yeah, you're right.

13:35.953 --> 13:37.722
Yeah, but I'm sitting
here trying to remember

13:37.724 --> 13:39.125
the last time that I saw you.

13:40.129 --> 13:40.630
Was it DC?

13:43.970 --> 13:45.204
You know what?

13:45.206 --> 13:46.406
I think it was DC.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.775
You know, it's
getting kind of late,

13:47.777 --> 13:49.747
so I should probably
just get going.

13:49.749 --> 13:51.282
You see, he was
just a young punk

13:51.284 --> 13:53.053
trying to run with our crowd.

13:53.055 --> 13:56.860
And honestly, we'd just tell
him to piss off... remember that?

13:56.862 --> 13:59.432
But he shows up with
a hot tip on a money

13:59.434 --> 14:01.703
drop in this old, busted safe.

14:01.705 --> 14:03.305
It was just too good to ignore.

14:03.307 --> 14:04.475
I would just go this way.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.180
So there we are, me and my
crew on the day of, and we

14:07.182 --> 14:09.118
realize this piece-of-shit
safe is so rusted,

14:09.120 --> 14:10.788
we can't even open it up.

14:10.790 --> 14:12.357
So Einstein here
takes a sledgehammer

14:12.359 --> 14:15.029
to the hardwood floor that's
connected to the safe.

14:15.031 --> 14:18.905
And then we have to carry
the damn thing out to the van

14:18.907 --> 14:20.741
and jimmy it open
before the cops show up.

14:20.743 --> 14:23.781
And guess what's inside?

14:23.783 --> 14:28.990
Nothing... absolutely nothing.

14:28.992 --> 14:31.196
Now, I'd vouched for
this guy right here,

14:31.198 --> 14:32.363
and I'm standing
there with my crew

14:32.365 --> 14:33.533
with our pecker in our hands.

14:33.535 --> 14:36.371
Yeah, but Seth, I told you,
I got some bad information

14:36.373 --> 14:38.008
about that drop.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.045
You know, my crew actually
thought that you lifted

14:39.047 --> 14:40.047
some of that money in transit.

14:40.049 --> 14:41.249
And I said no, no, no.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.787
That is absolutely ridiculous.

14:43.789 --> 14:45.090
But it would account
for this Rolex

14:45.092 --> 14:47.361
watch, the "Vesucci"
suit, and the $85 haircut.

14:47.363 --> 14:49.899
Which is a hand-me-down,
a knockoff, and I get my hair

14:49.901 --> 14:51.368
cut at a barber college!

14:51.370 --> 14:52.538
Relax, relax.

14:52.540 --> 14:53.841
$12.

14:53.843 --> 14:54.842
OK.

14:54.844 --> 14:58.416
Danny, hey, what's in
the past is in the past.

14:58.418 --> 15:00.921
Hey, if that wouldn't
have happened,

15:00.923 --> 15:02.792
I wouldn't be living the
dream I'm living right now.

15:02.794 --> 15:05.363
Seth, I'm really sorry.

15:05.365 --> 15:08.804
If there was any way that
I could make it up to you,

15:08.806 --> 15:09.237
I would.
I...

15:09.239 --> 15:09.842
Oh, really?

15:15.821 --> 15:17.858
Why don't you tell us a little
bit more about your granny.

15:42.405 --> 15:44.977
Hey, Gunnar!

15:44.979 --> 15:46.245
Is today payday?

15:46.247 --> 15:47.515
Yup.

15:47.517 --> 15:49.552
Third Saturday of every month
except for April and November,

15:49.554 --> 15:51.089
on account of the holidays.

15:51.091 --> 15:53.159
You always seem so surprised.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.295
$8, right?

15:54.297 --> 15:57.201
$9 now... inflation on account
of those leftist hippies

15:57.203 --> 15:58.536
raising the minimum wage.

15:58.538 --> 16:00.206
Sure.

16:00.208 --> 16:04.918
Gunnar, I'm sorry, but
give me one second.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.660
All right.

16:26.662 --> 16:27.996
Here you go.

16:27.998 --> 16:30.366
Now, can you break a $100 bill?

16:30.368 --> 16:33.339
Do I look like I carry that
kind of change around with me?

16:33.341 --> 16:34.341
OK.

16:34.343 --> 16:36.178
Well, how about you take
the money and consider

16:36.180 --> 16:38.651
us paid up for the
rest of the year?

16:38.653 --> 16:40.354
I don't do business that way.

16:40.356 --> 16:42.592
I get paid for the services
rendered and only then.

16:42.594 --> 16:44.394
Huh.

16:44.396 --> 16:45.433
What kind of Hitler Youth camp
did your parents send you to?

16:50.275 --> 16:51.409
OK.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.584
How about you take this as
a tip for a job well done?

16:57.389 --> 16:58.591
Uh, no.

16:58.593 --> 16:59.592
No, no, no.

16:59.594 --> 17:01.161
This seems like a trick.

17:01.163 --> 17:01.964
You know what?

17:01.966 --> 17:03.399
Have your money by
tomorrow or else

17:03.401 --> 17:04.468
I'm going to have to report you.

17:04.971 --> 17:07.373
Report me to who?

17:07.375 --> 17:09.613
Just have it!

17:09.615 --> 17:12.551
Bye, Gunnar.

17:26.816 --> 17:29.485
Grandma?

17:52.667 --> 17:54.137
What's with all the knocking?

17:57.511 --> 17:58.713
You definitely have
your mother's brains.

18:01.919 --> 18:04.354
Grandma, is everything OK?

18:04.356 --> 18:06.492
I just want some privacy.

18:06.494 --> 18:08.296
Where's your nurse, Alexandra?

18:08.298 --> 18:09.899
I
was thinking the same thing.

18:09.901 --> 18:12.738
She's supposed to tell
you to bugger off.

18:12.740 --> 18:15.242
I really think you got the
wrong idea about me, Grandma.

18:15.244 --> 18:16.648
Why don't we sit down,
and we can work this out?

18:19.821 --> 18:21.957
I really care about you.

18:21.959 --> 18:25.897
Not interested.

18:25.899 --> 18:27.467
All right, Grammy.

18:27.469 --> 18:28.771
Have it your way.

18:28.773 --> 18:30.640
I'll just help myself.

18:30.642 --> 18:31.709
Danny?

18:31.711 --> 18:32.745
Hey.

18:32.747 --> 18:33.980
Good that you're here.

18:33.982 --> 18:34.782
Hi.

18:34.784 --> 18:35.952
Hi.

18:35.954 --> 18:37.521
So sorry to surprise
you like this.

18:37.523 --> 18:39.358
I was, uh, just
running errands, and I

18:39.360 --> 18:40.794
thought that I would swing by.

18:40.796 --> 18:42.465
Did you get a
chance to say hi?

18:42.467 --> 18:43.933
Uh, yep.

18:43.935 --> 18:45.770
How did it go?

18:45.772 --> 18:46.906
Terrible.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.376
I'm sorry.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.912
She's having an
especially bad day today.

18:49.914 --> 18:50.880
Maybe try again tomorrow.

18:50.882 --> 18:52.016
Yeah.

18:52.018 --> 18:52.884
Hey, uh, what...
what are you doing

18:52.886 --> 18:54.255
with the rest of your day?

18:54.257 --> 18:55.491
Well, let me see.

18:55.493 --> 18:57.861
I have to unload a truckload
of supplies, feed the horses,

18:57.863 --> 19:00.935
change Claire's bedpan, then
treat myself to some mac

19:00.937 --> 19:01.670
and cheese for dinner.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.742
Well, I don't know what
the bedpan but let me

19:04.744 --> 19:05.479
help you with the rest of that.

19:17.871 --> 19:20.006
So how do you know Freddie?

19:20.008 --> 19:22.044
We were overseas together.

19:22.046 --> 19:24.080
Military guy.

19:24.082 --> 19:26.085
You guys like it rough, huh?

19:26.087 --> 19:29.091
I guess it's all that PTSD.

19:29.093 --> 19:30.760
You're not blonde.

19:30.762 --> 19:31.729
Oops.

19:33.367 --> 19:33.570
Sorry.

19:41.350 --> 19:44.120
All right.
Straight to it.

19:44.122 --> 19:45.925
I guess it's your hour.

19:45.927 --> 19:47.661
Speaking of...

19:56.782 --> 19:59.051
So what are you into?

19:59.053 --> 20:02.124
Bad schoolgirl?

20:02.126 --> 20:04.795
Or should I just
talk dirty to you?

20:07.804 --> 20:08.202
Hey.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.142
Hey, come here.

20:11.144 --> 20:11.843
Hey, hey.

20:11.845 --> 20:12.744
Hey, hey.

20:12.746 --> 20:13.847
Hey, hey, hey.

20:13.849 --> 20:14.882
Shh, shh, shh.

20:14.884 --> 20:15.485
It's OK.
It's OK.

20:15.487 --> 20:17.120
It's OK.
Hey, it's OK.

20:17.122 --> 20:18.156
It's OK.

20:18.158 --> 20:19.558
I'm not going to do anything.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.997
I'm not gonna do anything, OK?

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
Shut up.

20:23.001 --> 20:24.968
That's good.

20:24.970 --> 20:25.804
That's good.

20:25.806 --> 20:26.640
That's real good.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.610
It's OK.

20:28.612 --> 20:29.578
Yeah.

20:29.580 --> 20:29.781
See?

20:33.053 --> 20:35.524
That's a good girl.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.394
It's OK.

20:41.236 --> 20:42.472
Wow.

20:42.474 --> 20:43.907
I'm sorry to hear she said that.

20:43.909 --> 20:44.975
Yep.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.013
Not a dime.

20:47.015 --> 20:50.721
Well, my only inheritance was
my father's old army rucksack.

20:50.723 --> 20:52.492
And not to be a
one-upper or anything,

20:52.494 --> 20:55.497
but your grandmother called
me Helen for the first year

20:55.499 --> 20:56.130
I worked for her.

20:56.132 --> 20:57.634
Why?

20:57.636 --> 21:00.038
That was the name
of her last caregiver.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.976
She figured we're
probably all the same.

21:01.978 --> 21:04.046
You know, my dad was
like that with his dogs.

21:04.048 --> 21:06.753
He'd get these giant
schnauzers, name them all Lurch.

21:06.755 --> 21:07.755
Lurch One died.

21:07.757 --> 21:09.558
Then there was Lurch Two
and Lurch Three and...

21:09.560 --> 21:11.095
How many Lurches were there?

21:11.097 --> 21:12.129
You know, I don't know.

21:12.131 --> 21:13.633
I kind of lost track.

21:19.113 --> 21:20.245
Stop.

21:20.247 --> 21:20.915
Stop, hey.
Look, enough.

21:20.917 --> 21:21.616
Enough.

21:21.618 --> 21:22.685
Shut up.

21:22.687 --> 21:23.185
- Help!
- Shut up!

21:23.187 --> 21:23.486
Don't!

21:23.488 --> 21:24.321
Help!

21:24.323 --> 21:25.623
Hey, look, look.

21:25.625 --> 21:26.529
Stop it.
Stop it.

21:31.905 --> 21:32.804
Come here.

21:37.617 --> 21:38.849
Hi, Ginger.

21:38.851 --> 21:40.588
Hey.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.024
Now, she can be
a little feisty...

21:43.026 --> 21:45.863
kind of like her owner.

21:47.101 --> 21:49.104
I can tell.

21:49.106 --> 21:52.678
So Helen... sorry, Alex...

21:53.748 --> 21:55.182
...what are you doing tonight...

21:55.184 --> 21:56.952
you know, after
the mac and cheese?

21:56.954 --> 21:59.090
'Cause I was thinking maybe
we can go get a drink.

21:59.092 --> 22:00.628
Come on.

22:00.630 --> 22:01.929
It'll do you some good
to get out of the house.

22:01.931 --> 22:03.131
Plus, she'll be fine.

22:03.133 --> 22:04.333
I don't know, Danny.

22:04.335 --> 22:05.303
I don't think it's
such a good idea.

22:05.305 --> 22:07.240
What time is Claire's bedtime?

22:07.242 --> 22:09.979
These days, like,
um, around 7 o'clock.

22:09.981 --> 22:10.848
Perfect.

22:10.850 --> 22:11.215
Pick you up at 8:00.

22:12.018 --> 22:12.784
See?

22:12.786 --> 22:13.087
Ginger agrees.

22:18.330 --> 22:21.267
Ginger, what do you think?

22:21.269 --> 22:22.036
No?

22:35.164 --> 22:38.470
...give you a call.

22:38.472 --> 22:40.106
What the hell
are you doing, man?

22:40.108 --> 22:41.976
We're about to hit the
biggest score of our lives,

22:41.978 --> 22:43.179
and you're going to
screw it up by messing

22:43.181 --> 22:43.881
around with a hooker?

22:43.883 --> 22:45.249
Who's she going to tell, man?

22:45.251 --> 22:45.917
She's a whore!

22:45.919 --> 22:46.219
Shut up!

22:46.221 --> 22:46.920
Shut up.

22:46.922 --> 22:47.454
Come here.

22:51.731 --> 22:53.132
Here, let's
get you out of here.

22:53.134 --> 22:53.999
Come on.

23:16.481 --> 23:19.316
She wasn't going
to tell anyone.

23:19.318 --> 23:20.188
They always tell.

24:16.534 --> 24:19.237
We should probably
wait to put these on.

24:19.239 --> 24:19.842
Yeah.

24:23.347 --> 24:24.548
I'll be right there.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.085
Take your time.

24:41.116 --> 24:42.149
Wow.

24:42.151 --> 24:44.455
Hi.

24:44.457 --> 24:45.457
Give me two seconds.

24:45.459 --> 24:47.460
I'm going go check on
Claire one last time.

24:47.462 --> 24:47.931
No worries.

24:59.051 --> 25:01.320
Oh, shit!

25:01.322 --> 25:04.159
Oh, what the hell is that?

25:04.161 --> 25:05.530
That's Harold, my grandfather.

25:05.532 --> 25:08.536
I had him stuffed.

25:08.538 --> 25:10.006
Relax.

25:10.008 --> 25:10.741
It's a dummy.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.711
I teach CPR on the weekends.

25:12.713 --> 25:14.648
I do call him Harold, though.

25:14.650 --> 25:16.017
You all set?

25:16.019 --> 25:17.386
Yeah, let's go.

25:17.388 --> 25:18.455
Bye, Harold.

25:18.457 --> 25:19.491
How's Granny?

25:19.493 --> 25:20.393
She's dead to the world.

25:20.395 --> 25:20.997
Great.

25:47.782 --> 25:48.782
You bury her.

25:48.784 --> 25:51.088
I'll meet you out front.

25:51.090 --> 25:53.160
And stash the truck somewhere.

26:03.815 --> 26:07.286
It's about
to be on like a flame

26:07.288 --> 26:08.790
when you strike a match.

26:08.792 --> 26:11.261
When you're kissing me,
you're kissing me like that.

26:11.263 --> 26:12.430
I feel overdressed.

26:12.432 --> 26:12.931
What?

26:12.933 --> 26:13.800
No, you're great.

26:13.802 --> 26:14.767
Come on.

26:14.769 --> 26:15.804
Hey, excuse me.

26:15.806 --> 26:16.605
Could we get a couple menus?

26:16.607 --> 26:17.875
I don't work here.

26:17.877 --> 26:18.909
But I think you need
to order at the bar.

26:18.911 --> 26:19.778
OK, sorry.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.281
Oof.

26:21.283 --> 26:24.688
Not starting out great, am I?

26:47.335 --> 26:47.537
Shit!

26:50.373 --> 26:51.475
It's a dummy.

26:51.477 --> 26:52.042
Come on.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.247
Let's go check upstairs.

26:54.249 --> 26:54.451
Let's go.

27:07.842 --> 27:09.310
First time drinking beer?

27:09.312 --> 27:09.712
What is that?

27:09.714 --> 27:10.980
Strike two?

27:10.982 --> 27:13.418
No, not at all.

27:13.420 --> 27:15.422
But if I didn't
know any better, I'd

27:15.424 --> 27:16.658
say you're a little nervous.

27:16.660 --> 27:18.529
I'm a little nervous.

27:18.531 --> 27:19.965
I thought you just
looked so stunning,

27:19.967 --> 27:22.871
you just throw me off my game.

27:22.873 --> 27:24.374
OK, OK.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.611
How about we just drop
the game, and let's

27:26.613 --> 27:31.521
just enjoy some drinks and
have an adult conversation.

27:38.772 --> 27:39.638
There it is!

27:39.640 --> 27:41.776
Shut up.

27:41.778 --> 27:43.077
You're going to wake
the old lady, all right?

27:43.079 --> 27:44.315
It's a quick grab... in and out.

27:49.993 --> 27:52.063
Shots on the house for
the good-looking couple.

27:52.899 --> 27:54.600
Oh, thank you.

27:54.602 --> 27:56.605
All right, when
were these ordered?

27:56.607 --> 27:58.408
I... look, I did...
things are happening.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.844
It is out of my control.

27:59.846 --> 28:00.646
It's out of my hands.

28:00.648 --> 28:02.016
Oh, it's out of
your control, huh?

28:02.018 --> 28:03.885
We are a good-looking couple.

28:03.887 --> 28:04.620
Yeah, you only live once.

28:04.622 --> 28:05.823
So YOLO.

28:05.825 --> 28:06.625
Oh, no.

28:06.627 --> 28:07.258
No, no, no.

28:07.260 --> 28:09.096
You did not just say YOLO.

28:09.098 --> 28:10.667
I think I did.

28:10.669 --> 28:11.801
Mm.

28:11.803 --> 28:13.372
Mm.

28:13.374 --> 28:13.874
Oh.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.008
Ho-ah.

28:15.010 --> 28:17.412
OK, Danny, really.

28:17.414 --> 28:18.682
I have a confession to make.

28:18.684 --> 28:20.419
Oh, yeah?

28:20.421 --> 28:22.557
I was surprised
you asked me out.

28:22.559 --> 28:24.394
Really?

28:24.396 --> 28:25.830
Did you think you
weren't my type?

28:25.832 --> 28:27.601
No, no, it's not that.

28:27.603 --> 28:28.535
I just thought you were gay.

28:30.007 --> 28:30.906
Wait, what?

28:30.908 --> 28:32.877
- Why?
- No.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.146
It's not a bad thing.

28:34.148 --> 28:36.417
You're just... you
know, you're more,

28:36.419 --> 28:42.163
um, put together than most
of the guys around here.

28:42.165 --> 28:42.897
Mm.

28:42.899 --> 28:43.598
Noted.

28:49.646 --> 28:50.646
Melnick.

28:50.648 --> 28:54.487
Melnick, Melnick, Melnick.

28:54.489 --> 28:55.188
You got to be kidding me.

28:55.190 --> 28:58.161
Hey... psst.

28:58.163 --> 28:59.565
Nothing here says Melnick.

28:59.567 --> 29:01.067
How in the hell we gonna
open this thing up?

29:01.069 --> 29:03.772
Come over and help me.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.244
Girl, you are twisted.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.014
OK, you know, see...

29:08.016 --> 29:10.117
right there, that's the kind
of stuff that confuses people.

29:10.119 --> 29:10.819
What?

29:10.821 --> 29:11.955
Why?

29:11.957 --> 29:13.725
"Girl, you are twisted."

29:13.727 --> 29:15.830
OK, that sounded
a little confusing.

29:15.832 --> 29:16.731
All right.

29:16.733 --> 29:18.200
Relax.

29:18.202 --> 29:19.473
You might still get lucky today.

29:29.291 --> 29:30.259
Just sec.

29:30.261 --> 29:31.531
Let me just see who this is.

29:34.134 --> 29:35.836
Is everything OK?

29:35.838 --> 29:36.738
Yeah.

29:36.740 --> 29:37.941
Yeah.

29:37.943 --> 29:38.843
Yeah.

29:38.845 --> 29:39.545
Wow.

29:39.547 --> 29:41.114
This beer's really got to me.

29:41.116 --> 29:43.522
I'm just going to,
um, be right back.

29:49.867 --> 29:50.700
Finally.

29:50.702 --> 29:51.801
What's wrong?

29:51.803 --> 29:53.304
Wrong
model of safe, you dipshit.

29:53.306 --> 29:56.209
This is some kind of
hobnail I've never heard of.

30:01.623 --> 30:03.692
Keep her busy another hour.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.094
Easier said than done.

30:05.096 --> 30:06.064
Why?

30:06.066 --> 30:07.199
Your charm's not working?

30:07.201 --> 30:08.268
It's working too well.

30:08.270 --> 30:12.843
I don't know how much
longer I can put her off.

30:12.845 --> 30:13.845
Woo!

30:13.847 --> 30:14.213
Much better.

30:14.215 --> 30:15.682
Whoa!

30:15.684 --> 30:16.986
Looks like we're ready
for another round.

30:16.988 --> 30:17.854
It's late.
Let's go home.

30:17.856 --> 30:18.722
What?

30:18.724 --> 30:19.524
Why?

30:19.526 --> 30:20.291
We caused enough
damage already.

30:20.293 --> 30:21.327
Hey.
All right.

30:21.329 --> 30:22.062
Well, let me just get the tab.

30:22.064 --> 30:22.699
I already did.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.663
Everything OK?

30:38.665 --> 30:40.032
I just shouldn't have
left her that long.

30:40.034 --> 30:41.300
I have a bad feeling.

30:41.302 --> 30:43.004
I'm sure she's fine.

30:43.006 --> 30:44.140
Hey, it's a beautiful night.

30:44.142 --> 30:47.212
Let's go for a walk.

30:56.701 --> 30:59.403
Seth?

30:59.405 --> 31:01.909
Seth?

31:01.911 --> 31:04.079
Son of a bitch.

31:04.081 --> 31:05.717
God.

31:07.154 --> 31:08.988
Everything OK?

31:08.990 --> 31:10.358
Yeah.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.028
Did you say something
a minute ago?

31:12.030 --> 31:12.997
Me?

31:12.999 --> 31:14.200
No.

31:14.202 --> 31:15.837
Oh, my god.

31:15.839 --> 31:17.741
I'm so sorry I
rushed out like that.

31:17.743 --> 31:18.642
I feel like such an idiot.

31:18.644 --> 31:19.177
We were having such
a good time and...

31:19.179 --> 31:20.411
No.
No, no, no.

31:20.413 --> 31:21.380
I just... I got spooked a bit.

31:21.382 --> 31:22.381
I... I'm really sorry.

31:22.383 --> 31:24.053
Listen, I completely
understand, all right?

31:24.055 --> 31:24.857
You're just doing your job.

31:28.095 --> 31:31.400
You know, we can
still have a good time.

31:31.402 --> 31:31.805
Yeah?

31:55.050 --> 31:57.285
Pretty presumptuous,
don't you think?

31:57.287 --> 31:58.254
Uh...

31:58.256 --> 31:59.958
Just kidding.

32:18.530 --> 32:19.530
Oh.

32:24.508 --> 32:26.244
That was unexpected.

32:26.246 --> 32:28.247
Yeah.

32:28.249 --> 32:29.118
I'm gonna sleep so good tonight.

32:32.258 --> 32:34.526
Yeah, me too.

32:44.348 --> 32:47.252
I guess this means no
breakfast in the morning?

32:47.254 --> 32:49.355
No, I just figured
you'd want to sleep in.

32:49.357 --> 32:51.126
No, it's fine.

32:54.368 --> 32:55.301
What was that?

32:55.303 --> 32:56.203
You wait here.

32:56.205 --> 32:57.007
I'll go check it out.

33:24.327 --> 33:26.197
This
isn't what we talked about.

33:26.199 --> 33:28.234
We gotta figure out the
damn combination of the safe.

33:28.236 --> 33:30.004
We ought to be gone by now.

33:30.006 --> 33:32.175
Let's just walk away.

33:32.177 --> 33:32.843
No.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.348
We're sticking to the plan.

34:34.469 --> 34:35.534
You assholes.

34:35.536 --> 34:38.741
You were supposed to tell
me when she wakes up.

34:38.743 --> 34:42.248
There goes saying I had
nothing to do with this.

34:42.251 --> 34:44.721
I can not believe
she had sex with him.

34:44.723 --> 34:45.789
That's kind of surprising.

34:45.791 --> 34:47.626
I actually thought you were gay.

34:47.628 --> 34:48.896
You watch her.

34:48.898 --> 34:49.831
We're going to go
take care of the safe.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.300
Still?

34:51.302 --> 34:53.839
You've been at it all
night, Seth, Rudy.

34:53.841 --> 34:56.176
Thanks for saying
our name, Danny.

34:56.178 --> 34:57.479
Hey, you're not
doing me any favors.

35:02.959 --> 35:06.329
I don't care what she knows.

35:06.331 --> 35:09.636
Once we get that
safe open, she dies.

35:09.638 --> 35:10.270
Whoa, hey.

35:10.272 --> 35:11.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No.

35:11.342 --> 35:12.341
I did not agree to that.

35:12.343 --> 35:13.343
Shut up!

35:13.345 --> 35:16.717
She stays alive for now,
until we get the money.

35:16.719 --> 35:19.389
After that, who knows?

35:19.391 --> 35:19.593
Let's go.

35:23.701 --> 35:24.767
You know how to use this?

35:24.769 --> 35:25.337
Of course.

35:37.762 --> 35:39.497
Help.

35:40.634 --> 35:44.707
I guess there's not going
to be a second date, huh?

35:47.949 --> 35:49.850
All right, look, if I...

35:49.852 --> 35:51.623
I take off the gag, you
promise not to scream?

36:04.415 --> 36:08.789
Danny, you don't
need to do this.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.357
We can just walk away.

36:10.359 --> 36:10.961
I can't do that.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.133
I want to go.

36:14.135 --> 36:15.535
What time is it?

36:15.537 --> 36:16.438
Claire will be up
any minute now, and...

36:16.440 --> 36:17.439
Shh!

36:17.441 --> 36:18.273
We will cross that
bridge when we get to it.

36:18.275 --> 36:21.447
Just for... for now,
just sit tight.

36:29.799 --> 36:30.364
OK.

36:30.366 --> 36:31.369
I've read it 12 times.

36:38.616 --> 36:39.784
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:39.786 --> 36:41.152
What in the hell are you doing?

36:41.154 --> 36:42.021
Stop!

36:42.023 --> 36:44.559
What are you doing?

36:44.561 --> 36:44.862
Worth a shot.

36:49.571 --> 36:52.142
Now, if I go bust in on
that old woman right now,

36:52.144 --> 36:53.644
I guarantee you I'm
getting that combination.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.081
Yeah, and she'll probably
have a friggin' heart

36:55.083 --> 36:56.884
attack in there, too.

36:56.886 --> 36:58.622
You know she has one of those
life [INAUDIBLE] or something.

36:58.624 --> 37:02.595
We don't need that
added complication.

37:02.597 --> 37:03.632
Yes!

37:03.634 --> 37:05.200
You got it.

37:05.202 --> 37:05.735
Step one.

37:05.737 --> 37:06.706
We're getting there.

37:14.489 --> 37:17.125
You know, you're the
first person I've been

37:17.127 --> 37:20.966
with in a really long time.

37:20.968 --> 37:23.871
You're not going to get all
sentimental on me now, are you?

37:23.873 --> 37:25.073
Because I just...
I was just trying

37:25.075 --> 37:25.678
to get you out of the house.

37:28.951 --> 37:33.593
I mean, you weren't
really into me, were you?

37:37.635 --> 37:40.271
I... I didn't take you
as a romantic type.

37:53.767 --> 37:54.168
Shh!

38:08.697 --> 38:12.334
Special
reconnaissance regiment.

38:12.336 --> 38:14.675
Things just got a
lot more interesting.

38:20.219 --> 38:22.859
So Rudy tied you up pretty
good, so it's pointless.

38:30.808 --> 38:34.012
You see, the thing about
tying someone up to a chair...

38:34.014 --> 38:39.321
it isn't about how tight you
do it or how thick the rope is.

38:39.323 --> 38:42.060
It's not even how
strong the person is.

38:42.062 --> 38:48.775
The only thing that matters
is how strong the chair is.

39:12.692 --> 39:12.892
Oh!

39:21.475 --> 39:23.477
Oh!

39:26.953 --> 39:27.986
Oh!

39:27.988 --> 39:28.955
Oh!

39:28.957 --> 39:29.890
Oh!

39:29.892 --> 39:31.125
Get off him.

39:31.127 --> 39:31.894
Enough!

39:31.896 --> 39:32.428
That's enough!

39:32.430 --> 39:33.196
What are you doing?

39:33.198 --> 39:33.865
Just shoot her.

39:33.867 --> 39:35.033
Just shoot her!

40:48.649 --> 40:49.050
Oh!

40:54.226 --> 40:57.901
Hey, just so I'm clear, you
knew I had a vest on, right?

41:01.007 --> 41:02.576
She still here or she
make a run for it?

41:02.578 --> 41:03.376
She's still here.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.947
How do you know?

41:04.949 --> 41:06.316
I saw something.

41:06.318 --> 41:07.455
Let's just say
crazy knows crazy.

41:10.693 --> 41:12.363
You gonna tell me what
the hell just happened here?

41:16.337 --> 41:19.175
What's this about a special
reconnaissance regiment?

41:19.177 --> 41:20.310
They're no joke.

41:20.312 --> 41:23.183
Special forces...
mostly Black Ops.

41:23.185 --> 41:26.957
I crossed paths with a few
of them in Afghanistan.

41:26.959 --> 41:30.130
They were like ghosts.

41:30.132 --> 41:32.736
So you're telling
me we got a big problem.

41:32.738 --> 41:34.005
Yeah.

41:34.007 --> 41:36.510
Nothing I can't handle, though.

41:50.271 --> 41:51.741
Ah!

41:58.321 --> 41:59.992
Hey, it's a good
thing your grammy's deaf.

42:03.132 --> 42:04.198
So I thought you
said you knew her.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.706
Any other surprises you'd
like to let us in on?

42:07.708 --> 42:10.076
Hello, gentlemen.

42:10.078 --> 42:11.047
There's an intercom
in the house.

42:16.258 --> 42:18.160
Well, hello
there, little lady.

42:18.162 --> 42:20.665
I don't suppose
there's any scenario

42:20.667 --> 42:24.705
that allows us all to walk out
of this house in one piece?

42:24.707 --> 42:25.406
No.

42:25.408 --> 42:26.579
I don't see how that's possible.

42:30.386 --> 42:34.559
Well, since you can't be
bought and you won't leave,

42:34.561 --> 42:37.531
I guess we're going to have
us a little bit of a dogfight.

42:37.533 --> 42:38.102
Yep.

42:41.843 --> 42:43.312
You really care about that
old lady that much, huh?

42:47.520 --> 42:48.754
All right.

42:48.756 --> 42:49.956
It's time for you
to earn your money.

42:49.958 --> 42:50.858
I don't want to see or hear
from that tramp ever again,

42:50.860 --> 42:51.627
you got it?

42:53.466 --> 42:55.333
And you, lover boy, you're
pretty much useless.

42:55.335 --> 42:56.436
Hey, you're going
to need all the help

42:56.438 --> 42:57.403
you can get with that girl.

42:57.405 --> 42:58.205
Try again.

42:58.207 --> 43:02.314
OK, well, till
that safe is open,

43:02.316 --> 43:03.487
you have no idea what
else might happen.

43:06.492 --> 43:08.393
All right.

43:08.395 --> 43:10.264
But if you start to
become a liability,

43:10.266 --> 43:11.265
I will not think
twice about putting

43:11.267 --> 43:12.635
my boot through your skull.

43:12.637 --> 43:13.105
You got that?

44:40.112 --> 44:43.951
I'm sorry about that.

44:43.953 --> 44:47.625
I was going to say something,
but I was enjoying the show.

44:47.627 --> 44:50.932
Well, I enjoyed giving it.

44:50.934 --> 44:55.376
So this Danny guy,
that's your type?

44:58.482 --> 45:05.460
I thought for sure you'd go for
someone with a bit more edge.

45:05.462 --> 45:08.867
I saw your tags.

45:08.869 --> 45:11.540
I'm impressed.

45:11.542 --> 45:17.452
I, uh, opted for
the Marines myself.

45:17.454 --> 45:19.623
Well, you know what they say...

45:19.625 --> 45:22.126
join the Air Force
if you have no guts.

45:22.128 --> 45:25.935
Join the Marines if
you have no brains.

45:25.937 --> 45:27.504
Let me guess...

45:27.506 --> 45:29.542
5150?

45:29.544 --> 45:33.484
No... Section 8?

45:33.486 --> 45:35.791
Officially, no.

45:41.133 --> 45:41.535
Really?

45:45.710 --> 45:46.644
All right.

45:46.646 --> 45:51.919
We were on a scout
just south of Azizabad.

45:51.921 --> 45:53.823
Like
that, we start taking

45:53.825 --> 45:58.199
gunfire from atop this hill,
so I didn't waste any time.

45:58.201 --> 45:59.735
I grab the M-80...

45:59.737 --> 46:01.205
pop, pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop...

46:01.207 --> 46:05.714
I started carving up the
forest, predator style.

46:05.716 --> 46:09.622
And after about a
minute, my lieutenant,

46:09.624 --> 46:11.092
he's screaming at me.

46:11.094 --> 46:13.029
Hold your fire!

46:13.031 --> 46:15.601
Those are our guys!

46:15.603 --> 46:20.143
I thought to myself,
I don't care who it is.

46:20.145 --> 46:21.980
They fired first.

46:21.982 --> 46:22.881
So I kept going.

46:22.883 --> 46:23.182
Boom!

46:23.184 --> 46:24.118
Boom!

46:24.120 --> 46:24.985
Boom!

46:27.226 --> 46:29.696
...till they were dead...

46:29.698 --> 46:31.999
all of 'em.

46:32.001 --> 46:37.811
Shit, the rest of the guys in
my squad were so terrified,

46:37.813 --> 46:40.083
no one said a word.

46:40.085 --> 46:43.122
I thought for sure,
once I got back to camp,

46:43.124 --> 46:45.627
I'd be court-martialed.

46:45.629 --> 46:49.034
But no, they... discharge.

46:49.036 --> 46:51.773
Half a pension.

46:51.775 --> 46:56.984
I guess they didn't want
the, uh, bad publicity.

46:56.986 --> 47:01.191
But see now... now, I feel
like I'm talking too much.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.894
Tell me more about you.

47:02.896 --> 47:05.968
But see that...
that right there...

47:05.970 --> 47:07.638
huh-uh.

47:07.640 --> 47:10.045
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

47:13.051 --> 47:15.655
Really?

47:15.657 --> 47:17.791
What's in your belt?

47:17.793 --> 47:20.898
I can grab that knife
and throw it in your neck

47:20.900 --> 47:22.236
before you can even
get the hammer cocked.

47:26.209 --> 47:27.309
Show me.

47:28.048 --> 47:28.781
Ow.

47:29.450 --> 47:30.717
Not bad.

47:30.719 --> 47:32.421
Not exactly my neck but not bad.

47:32.725 --> 47:34.426
Oh, oh.

48:28.367 --> 48:32.273
Not bad for a marine, huh?

48:51.447 --> 48:52.315
Not bad at all.

48:58.361 --> 49:01.566
You don't think Rudy did
anything to her, do you?

49:01.568 --> 49:04.572
Well, I got some bad news
for you there, lover boy.

49:04.574 --> 49:05.573
This doesn't end
with the two of you

49:05.575 --> 49:07.377
running off to the Caribbean.

49:07.379 --> 49:08.313
I know that.

49:08.315 --> 49:10.048
It... it's just that
you said that nobody

49:10.050 --> 49:10.951
was going to get hurt.

49:10.953 --> 49:11.154
Shh.

49:27.452 --> 49:28.387
Go check that out.

49:34.132 --> 49:35.001
Seriously?

49:39.711 --> 49:40.480
Man, come on.

49:45.422 --> 49:47.357
Hey, is
that your grandmother?

49:47.359 --> 49:50.195
Is she ambulatory?

49:50.197 --> 49:51.733
Can she walk?

49:51.735 --> 49:54.504
Yeah, I think so.

49:54.506 --> 49:55.609
Actually, I don't know.

50:01.722 --> 50:03.389
Psst.

50:03.391 --> 50:06.361
Hey, what the hell is this?

50:06.363 --> 50:09.334
Get up here now!

50:09.336 --> 50:10.335
Oh!

50:10.337 --> 50:10.940
Oh.

50:15.515 --> 50:17.117
Where's your friend?

50:28.273 --> 50:30.679
Well, I guess it's safe to say
you're not some ordinary nurse.

50:34.419 --> 50:36.556
Bet you didn't
know, little lady,

50:36.558 --> 50:39.428
but I did a little
time in the pen.

50:39.430 --> 50:40.697
Oh, yeah.

50:40.699 --> 50:43.335
Yep.

50:43.337 --> 50:47.076
Delaware State Penitentiary.

50:47.078 --> 50:50.349
Yeah, I did a variety of shit
jobs but none more important

50:50.351 --> 50:52.754
than the time I was
down at the gallows.

50:55.360 --> 50:58.800
Did you know that Delaware
is one of the last states

50:58.802 --> 51:04.410
to use hanging as a form
of capital punishment?

51:04.412 --> 51:07.550
And yours truly, he
got to witness one.

51:13.799 --> 51:16.902
You know, the thing about
hangings, the lucky ones

51:16.904 --> 51:19.340
would have their necks
snap from the drop,

51:19.342 --> 51:22.213
and they'd be out
like that.

51:22.215 --> 51:25.185
If they made it
past that, well...

51:25.187 --> 51:28.159
well, they're in for a
very long, torturous ordeal

51:28.161 --> 51:30.930
where their lungs
try to come up and...

51:30.932 --> 51:33.602
and they can't get any air.

51:35.843 --> 51:38.345
Look at you.

51:38.347 --> 51:39.916
You know, I watched
old Ronny Oberman

51:39.918 --> 51:44.356
struggle for 45 minutes.

51:44.358 --> 51:46.260
So my question to
you, miss, is how long

51:46.262 --> 51:47.766
do you think you're gonna last?

51:52.809 --> 51:54.343
It's a cop.

51:54.345 --> 51:55.680
- We're screwed.
- No.

51:55.682 --> 51:57.416
I don't think so.

51:57.418 --> 51:59.253
She could probably
escape if she wanted to.

51:59.255 --> 52:00.424
She's here for
the same reason we

52:00.426 --> 52:01.726
are... she wants the damn money.

52:01.728 --> 52:02.594
Help me get her down.

52:02.596 --> 52:02.962
Come on!

52:02.964 --> 52:03.298
Hurry up.

52:09.276 --> 52:12.648
Yeah, the Petersons called
saying they heard something

52:12.650 --> 52:15.253
like gunshots a little bit ago.

52:15.255 --> 52:16.855
Yeah, I heard that, too.

52:16.857 --> 52:18.793
What do you think it was?

52:18.795 --> 52:20.262
Probably just
some kids shooting

52:20.264 --> 52:21.865
cans in the wash or something.

52:21.867 --> 52:22.901
Yeah.

52:22.903 --> 52:24.304
Well, thanks for checking in.

52:24.306 --> 52:25.440
How's Claire doing?

52:25.442 --> 52:27.276
I think I'd like to talk to her.

52:27.278 --> 52:28.912
Hey, honey, have
you seen my razor?

52:28.914 --> 52:31.351
Oh, hey, officer.

52:31.353 --> 52:32.655
Holy shit.

52:32.657 --> 52:33.555
Danny!

52:33.557 --> 52:34.525
Yeah.

52:34.527 --> 52:35.926
It's me, Tommy...

52:35.928 --> 52:37.463
Tommy Tillman.

52:37.465 --> 52:39.333
You used to play Little
League with my brother.

52:39.335 --> 52:39.968
How's it going?

52:39.970 --> 52:41.673
Good.

52:41.675 --> 52:43.075
Man, he had one hell of a
curveball for a 10-year-old.

52:43.077 --> 52:44.879
Yeah, yeah.

52:44.881 --> 52:47.518
Yeah, I remember you used to cry
every time he struck you out.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.519
Yep.

52:48.521 --> 52:49.721
What are you, uh, what
are you doing back here?

52:49.723 --> 52:50.557
I thought you moved away.

52:50.559 --> 52:51.191
Visiting.

52:51.193 --> 52:52.927
Claire is my grandmother.

52:52.929 --> 52:53.930
She's never
mentioned you before.

52:53.932 --> 52:54.831
Yeah.

52:54.833 --> 52:55.867
That sounds about right.

52:55.869 --> 52:57.704
Well, Tommy, we're
getting ready to head out.

52:57.706 --> 53:00.108
Um, is there anything
else we can help you with?

53:01.581 --> 53:02.747
I mean, I really
should talk to Claire.

53:05.053 --> 53:06.456
Is there somebody
else in the house?

53:06.458 --> 53:07.090
- No... I don't...
- No.

53:07.092 --> 53:07.861
No.
Hmm-mm.

53:14.639 --> 53:14.841
No!

53:29.569 --> 53:29.770
Shoot her.

53:33.912 --> 53:36.414
What the hell are you doing?

53:36.416 --> 53:37.085
Shoot her!

53:46.069 --> 53:46.972
It's some kid.

53:50.011 --> 53:51.912
I'll take care of that.

53:51.914 --> 53:53.148
No, wait.

53:53.150 --> 53:54.819
We only have a few hours...

53:54.821 --> 53:57.925
tops... before that cop's
buddies come poking around here.

53:57.927 --> 53:59.597
It'll be half that time
if that kid goes missing.

54:05.173 --> 54:07.179
You ever point a gun at
me again, you better use it.

54:10.017 --> 54:12.220
Oh, shit.

54:14.960 --> 54:15.563
Alex!

54:40.311 --> 54:42.613
So what's up with the kid?

54:42.615 --> 54:46.321
I owe him $9.00.

54:46.323 --> 54:48.992
I dare you to do that again.

54:55.308 --> 54:57.945
Ow!

55:04.058 --> 55:05.092
You know what?

55:05.094 --> 55:07.897
I think I just figured it out.

55:07.899 --> 55:12.340
If we get the kid, she'll
do whatever we want.

55:12.342 --> 55:13.776
I'm going to go look out front.

55:13.778 --> 55:16.716
If you see him, you grab him.

55:16.718 --> 55:17.152
Go get him.

56:02.809 --> 56:03.778
Just get the hell
out of here, kid.

56:07.351 --> 56:09.722
Alex!

56:09.724 --> 56:11.192
I don't work for free, you know!

56:35.909 --> 56:37.543
Gunnar!

56:37.545 --> 56:39.113
Glad I caught you.

56:39.115 --> 56:41.017
It's $9, right?

56:41.019 --> 56:42.152
Um, let me see.

56:42.154 --> 56:44.223
I got... perfect.

56:44.225 --> 56:45.259
Can you break a $10?

56:45.261 --> 56:46.126
Yeah.

56:46.128 --> 56:46.329
Thanks.

57:13.350 --> 57:16.454
You all right?

57:16.456 --> 57:18.257
He's all right.

57:18.259 --> 57:20.261
I'm cracking open that safe,
and you take care of that bitch

57:20.263 --> 57:20.900
once and for all.

57:51.960 --> 57:53.028
Let's go.

57:53.030 --> 57:53.231
Let's go.

57:58.974 --> 58:00.144
Pick up the pace.

58:03.317 --> 58:03.716
Yeah, yeah.

58:03.718 --> 58:05.384
Who is this?

58:05.386 --> 58:08.358
Is that any
way to treat an old friend?

58:08.360 --> 58:09.460
Alex?

58:09.462 --> 58:10.562
Hey, it's been years.

58:10.564 --> 58:12.232
How are you?

58:12.234 --> 58:14.203
Can't complain.

58:14.205 --> 58:15.238
How about you?

58:15.240 --> 58:18.210
Still babysitting
dumb and dumber?

58:18.212 --> 58:19.012
Yeah.

58:19.014 --> 58:22.453
Even morons can be
useful at times.

58:22.455 --> 58:24.122
What about me?

58:24.124 --> 58:27.096
Was I one of your
youthful morons?

58:27.098 --> 58:29.332
Absolutely not.

58:30.571 --> 58:31.039
Are you OK?

58:35.213 --> 58:36.114
I'm fine.

58:36.116 --> 58:38.384
Alex, I know you.

58:38.386 --> 58:39.653
Where are you?

58:39.655 --> 58:40.491
I can have a team there ASAP.

58:44.398 --> 58:45.633
No.

58:45.635 --> 58:48.338
I thought I could
leave it all behind.

58:48.340 --> 58:52.413
But no matter where I
go, it always finds me.

58:52.415 --> 58:54.083
Where are you?

58:54.085 --> 58:55.620
You're using a
satellite phone, right?

58:55.622 --> 58:57.157
Send me your coordinates.

59:05.742 --> 59:08.143
It's been really nice
to catch up with you.

59:08.145 --> 59:10.215
I'll talk to you soon.

59:11.453 --> 59:12.454
Alex.

59:12.456 --> 59:12.655
Alex!

59:15.761 --> 59:16.162
Shit.

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:48.011
No, no.

01:00:48.013 --> 01:00:49.781
No, I got you now.

01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:51.017
Yeah.

01:00:51.019 --> 01:00:53.420
Even though it seems
a little too easy

01:00:53.422 --> 01:00:55.725
for it all to end this way.

01:00:55.727 --> 01:00:58.766
So why don't you drop the
gun, and we can even the scales?

01:00:58.768 --> 01:01:00.334
I would.

01:01:00.336 --> 01:01:04.342
I really would, except I
am sick and tired of you!

01:01:04.344 --> 01:01:06.782
It's over!

01:01:09.555 --> 01:01:11.558
Are you crying?

01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:14.730
You're crying?

01:01:14.732 --> 01:01:17.669
Oh, oh.

01:01:17.671 --> 01:01:17.872
Oh!

01:01:28.026 --> 01:01:28.726
Yeah.

01:01:28.728 --> 01:01:29.660
Yeah!

01:01:29.662 --> 01:01:32.468
Like I said, crazy knows crazy!

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:37.943
Yeah.

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:39.947
Yeah.

01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:40.750
Look at that.

01:01:40.752 --> 01:01:41.717
You...

01:01:41.719 --> 01:01:42.486
Yeah.

01:01:44.424 --> 01:01:45.926
No.

01:01:45.928 --> 01:01:47.396
No.

01:01:47.398 --> 01:01:50.568
You're scared that
gun's gonna jam again.

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:53.642
I'm gonna carve up this
pretty little face of yours.

01:01:53.644 --> 01:01:55.845
No.

01:01:55.847 --> 01:01:57.784
No, you're not gonna
pull that trigger.

01:01:57.786 --> 01:02:00.823
'Cause you're no killer.

01:02:00.825 --> 01:02:01.858
You don't have the ba...

01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:12.044
Oh, come on, man.

01:02:12.046 --> 01:02:13.714
I don't like the sound of that.

01:02:13.716 --> 01:02:15.150
It sounds to me
like Rudy's down there

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:17.789
taking care of some business.

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:19.960
Yes!

01:02:19.962 --> 01:02:21.697
One more, and we got her.

01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:22.499
Let's just get out of here.

01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:23.802
Things are getting
out of control.

01:02:23.804 --> 01:02:25.003
OK, you know what?

01:02:25.005 --> 01:02:26.641
You need to calm down.

01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:28.109
Now, your little girlfriend
became more of a problem

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.516
than we anticipated, so
if you'd shut the hell up,

01:02:30.518 --> 01:02:31.917
let me do my job,
then guess what?

01:02:31.919 --> 01:02:32.556
We'll get out of here.

01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:13.333
Well, that doesn't look right.

01:03:13.335 --> 01:03:15.738
Hey, get your ass in here.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.076
I got her open.

01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:22.753
Thank god.

01:03:22.755 --> 01:03:24.624
So how much do you
think is in there?

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.359
Well, I'm not really
too good at math,

01:03:26.361 --> 01:03:30.033
but I would venture
to say nothing.

01:03:30.035 --> 01:03:32.071
I should take your nuts and
shove 'em down your throat

01:03:32.073 --> 01:03:32.806
right now!

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:33.608
No, I saw it!

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:34.175
I saw it!

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:34.844
I know it's in there!

01:03:34.846 --> 01:03:36.948
Dammit!

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:38.284
Something's not right
about this, Seth.

01:03:38.286 --> 01:03:38.986
Something's not right.

01:03:38.988 --> 01:03:40.689
Why would she disable our cars?

01:03:40.691 --> 01:03:41.390
So that we're trapped?

01:03:41.392 --> 01:03:43.661
Why would she do that?

01:03:44.397 --> 01:03:46.867
And there's Rudy.

01:03:46.869 --> 01:03:49.742
You
better find the money.

01:04:22.874 --> 01:04:27.047
You know, in the beginning,
you were an added complication.

01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:29.319
Then you became a nuisance.

01:04:29.321 --> 01:04:32.727
And I thought you
were kind of hot.

01:04:32.729 --> 01:04:33.965
But now, you're
just going to die.

01:04:48.226 --> 01:04:49.226
Come here.

01:04:49.228 --> 01:04:49.794
Ha!

01:04:49.796 --> 01:04:53.234
I'm actually impressed.

01:06:25.988 --> 01:06:29.158
Oh, Seth, you know
I really enjoyed

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.230
the little how-to speech
you gave earlier on hanging.

01:06:32.232 --> 01:06:33.100
No, no.

01:06:33.102 --> 01:06:36.172
No, no, no.

01:06:36.174 --> 01:06:39.012
I actually knew about the
whole suffocation thing.

01:06:39.014 --> 01:06:40.983
You just seemed
so eager to share.

01:06:40.985 --> 01:06:43.454
I didn't want to
interrupt your moment.

01:06:43.456 --> 01:06:46.761
I've witnessed a hanging, too.

01:06:50.302 --> 01:06:52.337
When I was embedded
in an Al-Qaeda cell

01:06:52.339 --> 01:06:56.145
in the Philippines, I stood
by and watched as they strung

01:06:56.147 --> 01:06:58.585
up an entire missionary group...

01:06:58.587 --> 01:07:02.525
men, women, children.

01:07:02.527 --> 01:07:04.197
I watched as they
all helplessly died.

01:07:20.563 --> 01:07:21.499
It was really nice
meeting you, Seth.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.186
Hey, Grandma.

01:07:33.188 --> 01:07:35.725
I'm sure by now you
heard all the ruckus.

01:07:35.727 --> 01:07:36.697
You are a heavy sleeper.

01:07:52.894 --> 01:07:56.434
She died yesterday.

01:07:56.436 --> 01:07:59.839
What... did you really think
I would leave her alone

01:07:59.841 --> 01:08:01.510
just to go on a date with you?

01:08:01.512 --> 01:08:03.179
But... but, why?

01:08:03.181 --> 01:08:04.282
Why?
Why would you do that?

01:08:04.284 --> 01:08:04.884
Why would you leave her?

01:08:04.886 --> 01:08:07.421
You're her caretaker.

01:08:07.423 --> 01:08:10.829
It's caregiver.

01:08:10.831 --> 01:08:14.169
And besides, the coroner
couldn't come until Monday.

01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:16.939
Should I have put
her in the freezer?

01:08:16.942 --> 01:08:17.375
But I...

01:08:17.377 --> 01:08:20.615
I talked to her.

01:08:20.617 --> 01:08:21.115
Grandma?

01:08:21.117 --> 01:08:21.819
Is everything OK?

01:08:24.791 --> 01:08:26.192
I'm fine.

01:08:26.194 --> 01:08:26.729
I just want some privacy.

01:08:38.687 --> 01:08:39.384
OK.

01:08:39.386 --> 01:08:39.952
Relax.

01:08:39.953 --> 01:08:40.720
It wasn't that funny.

01:08:40.723 --> 01:08:42.291
It's mine.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:43.192
It's all mine.

01:08:43.194 --> 01:08:45.430
The old bat never
had a will, and I'm

01:08:45.433 --> 01:08:47.267
her only living relative.

01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:51.843
So wherever the money is, this
house, everything... it's mine.

01:09:10.617 --> 01:09:13.356
See, Claire was scared
of that, so she adopted me.

01:09:17.464 --> 01:09:18.162
Wait.

01:09:18.165 --> 01:09:20.366
How can you even adopt an adult?

01:09:20.368 --> 01:09:22.337
You know, I thought
the same thing, too.

01:09:22.339 --> 01:09:27.783
Apparently you can, which
would make me the next of kin.

01:09:27.785 --> 01:09:30.988
Now, Danny, you can try to
fight this and hire lawyers,

01:09:30.991 --> 01:09:35.395
but with your lack of resources
and overall sketchy past,

01:09:35.398 --> 01:09:38.504
it would be a lost
cause on your part.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:45.015
Oh, Danny, Danny,
Danny, I'm starting

01:09:45.018 --> 01:09:46.555
to feel really sorry for you.

01:10:06.728 --> 01:10:09.733
Tell you what... you can go.

01:10:09.735 --> 01:10:11.704
What?

01:10:11.706 --> 01:10:12.839
That's right.
You can go.

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:15.944
You can just get up and leave.

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:17.414
I'm not going to snap
your neck or anything.

01:10:19.186 --> 01:10:20.957
I even put the battery
back in the car for you.

01:10:24.464 --> 01:10:25.099
And one last thing
before you go...

01:10:30.911 --> 01:10:33.046
you see, I haven't
quite figured out what

01:10:33.048 --> 01:10:34.682
I'm going to spend it on yet.

01:10:34.684 --> 01:10:35.619
I don't know.

01:10:35.621 --> 01:10:37.153
I'll probably just
donate it to some animal

01:10:37.155 --> 01:10:38.624
rescue or something.

01:10:38.626 --> 01:10:40.894
Are you a cat or a dog person?

01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:45.839
God damn it.

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:48.109
You fight worse than you screw.

01:11:16.301 --> 01:11:17.769
God!

01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:18.172
Ah!

01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:31.130
Alex!

01:11:42.219 --> 01:11:42.622
Alex!

01:11:57.182 --> 01:11:57.584
Alex?

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.012
Alex?

01:12:18.993 --> 01:12:21.733
How many of those damn things
she have lying around here?

01:12:30.949 --> 01:12:31.151
Alex!

01:12:36.628 --> 01:12:38.398
You just can't
get enough, can you?

01:12:43.975 --> 01:12:47.314
I'm actually going to miss
all of this when it's over.

01:12:47.316 --> 01:12:50.320
This is the most fun
I've had in years.

01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:55.029
Wait!

01:12:55.031 --> 01:12:55.465
Oh!

01:13:07.824 --> 01:13:09.493
Not my best
forgery, but it's

01:13:09.495 --> 01:13:10.698
the best I can do in a pinch.

01:13:18.244 --> 01:13:18.810
911.

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:20.481
What's your emergency?

01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:21.281
Oh, my god!

01:13:21.283 --> 01:13:22.350
Please help me!

01:13:22.352 --> 01:13:23.353
They've broken into the house.

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:24.055
They're trying to kill me.

01:13:24.057 --> 01:13:26.259
Please! Oh, my god.

01:13:26.261 --> 01:13:27.163
They can hear me.

01:13:55.953 --> 01:13:58.858
Well, that's interesting.

01:15:06.227 --> 01:15:07.293
All right, everyone.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.565
Last round of action.

01:15:09.567 --> 01:15:09.968
Fold.

01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:15.345
I raise ya' 10.

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:19.219
Fold.

01:15:23.395 --> 01:15:35.483
Call your 10,000
and raise you 10,000.

01:15:43.469 --> 01:15:45.471
Woo.

01:15:45.473 --> 01:15:47.575
All right.

01:15:47.577 --> 01:15:48.177
I'll call.

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:52.852
I'm out.

01:15:52.854 --> 01:15:54.521
Full house.

01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:57.661
Oh, man.

01:15:57.663 --> 01:16:00.165
Wait!

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:02.269
Wait!

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:07.313
I'm not sure, but I think
four queens beat a full house.

01:16:09.186 --> 01:16:10.386
This is some bullshit.

01:16:10.388 --> 01:16:11.220
Oh, come on.

01:16:11.222 --> 01:16:13.593
Lennox, nobody
likes a sore loser.

01:16:13.595 --> 01:16:17.435
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
that is it for me tonight.

01:16:17.437 --> 01:16:19.271
Oh, you guys know which
way it is to the pisser?

01:16:19.273 --> 01:16:20.409
I'll find it.

01:16:26.522 --> 01:16:26.756
Wait a minute.

01:16:29.761 --> 01:16:31.361
Well, what do you know?

01:16:31.363 --> 01:16:34.801
Son of a bitch.

01:16:50.402 --> 01:16:50.737
Can I help you?

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:54.879
I'm not holding anything.

01:16:58.384 --> 01:16:59.719
Now I am.

01:16:59.721 --> 01:17:02.691
I still have all the
money... well, most of it.

01:17:02.693 --> 01:17:03.994
But I could give
it all back to you.

01:17:03.996 --> 01:17:06.665
Yes, I know you will.

01:17:07.670 --> 01:17:09.271
Cheatin' little cocksucker.

01:17:09.273 --> 01:17:12.644
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],
cocksucker.

01:17:12.646 --> 01:17:13.647
What are you doing?

01:17:13.649 --> 01:17:15.015
If they kill you, then
I don't get my money.

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:17.020
Oh!

01:17:20.264 --> 01:17:25.264
