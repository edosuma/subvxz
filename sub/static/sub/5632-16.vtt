WEBVTT

00:00.795 --> 00:02.027
<i>(man sighs)</i>

00:02.063 --> 00:03.976
WOMAN:
<i>Hurry up. It's in here.</i>

00:08.769 --> 00:10.568
(door opens)

00:12.953 --> 00:14.452
You know,
when you texted me,

00:14.488 --> 00:16.020
"Let's get
crazy tonight,"

00:16.056 --> 00:18.523
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

00:18.558 --> 00:20.091
Someone has
to do something, okay?

00:20.127 --> 00:21.426
These poor rats
are being tortured.

00:21.461 --> 00:23.595
Yeah, it sure sucks
to be a rat, huh?

00:23.630 --> 00:25.263
I'll have you know
that rats

00:25.298 --> 00:27.398
are highly empathetic creatures,
unlike you.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.300
I'm emphatic.
Empathetic.

00:29.336 --> 00:31.102
Yeah, that's what I said.
Come here.

00:31.138 --> 00:32.937
Not now, Joey.

00:32.973 --> 00:35.273
(rats squeaking)

00:36.843 --> 00:39.010
This is the one where they're
starving the rats to death.

00:39.045 --> 00:40.678
Bummer.

00:45.185 --> 00:47.819
Someone already
broke open the cages.

00:47.854 --> 00:49.888
Then why are
the rats still here?

00:49.923 --> 00:51.890
(screams)

00:59.166 --> 01:02.066
So I guess a hookup
is off the table?

01:02.102 --> 01:03.868
(groans)

01:09.209 --> 01:12.277
(dishes clattering)

01:12.312 --> 01:14.512
Uh, hey, Bones,
sorry I woke you up.

01:14.548 --> 01:15.914
Well, I'm glad you did.

01:15.949 --> 01:18.616
You know, studies show
that late night eating

01:18.652 --> 01:20.552
can increase
blood sugar levels.

01:20.587 --> 01:24.722
Okay, uh, you know, Parker's
been really busy, you know,

01:24.758 --> 01:27.091
at school, and this is
the only time that we can talk.

01:27.127 --> 01:28.827
So let's give him a ring.

01:28.862 --> 01:30.094
I-I would love
to talk to Parker.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.396
I miss him, too.

01:31.431 --> 01:34.165
Hey, good morning.

01:34.201 --> 01:37.035
Morning, or good
middle of the night.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.269
Hi, Bones.

01:38.305 --> 01:39.604
Hi, Parker. How's London?

01:39.639 --> 01:40.738
Oh, I'm just
getting ready for school.

01:40.774 --> 01:41.774
Well, listen,

01:41.808 --> 01:43.408
one month away
before it's me,

01:43.443 --> 01:45.710
you,
and the Appalachian Trail.

01:45.745 --> 01:47.846
That should be great.

01:47.881 --> 01:49.380
So look, I took a look
at the map and I figured

01:49.416 --> 01:51.616
we start, uh,
at Iron Mountain.

01:51.651 --> 01:53.384
(horn honks)

01:53.420 --> 01:55.220
Oh, shoot, my ride's here early.

01:55.255 --> 01:57.021
Already?

01:57.057 --> 02:01.226
I-I really should go, Dad.
I'm sorry.

02:01.261 --> 02:02.460
Oh, oh, yeah, okay, uh.

02:02.495 --> 02:04.128
Okay, have-have a great day.
I love you.

02:04.164 --> 02:06.130
You, too. Bye, Bones.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.565
Bye.

02:10.637 --> 02:12.704
Well, back to bed. Okay.

02:12.739 --> 02:15.173
(phones ring)
BOTH: Oh.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.841
Oh, that's yours.
Sorry.

02:16.877 --> 02:19.244
Oh, a body was found
in the rat lab

02:19.279 --> 02:20.712
at Lynwood University.

02:20.747 --> 02:23.214
I'll ask my father
to come over.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.083
Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll, uh,

02:25.118 --> 02:28.286
get to the FBI,
and get the day started, and...

02:28.321 --> 02:29.487
(clears throat)

02:29.522 --> 02:30.622
What? It's breakfast.

02:30.657 --> 02:34.626
(muttering) No reason
why I can't eat the breakfast.

02:39.866 --> 02:42.500
(indistinct radio transmissions)

02:42.535 --> 02:43.735
Wow.

02:43.770 --> 02:45.737
I have to admit, as a doctor,

02:45.772 --> 02:48.706
it's pretty exciting to be
in the Lynwood bio lab.

02:48.742 --> 02:49.941
You do realize this is

02:49.976 --> 02:51.809
a possible
murder investigation, right?

02:51.845 --> 02:53.444
I know, but I can't help it.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.847
Some of the most important
advances in medical science

02:55.882 --> 02:57.448
happened in these rooms.

02:57.484 --> 02:58.650
Huh.

02:58.685 --> 02:59.918
What?
Nothing.

02:59.953 --> 03:01.286
I guess I just
always thought you were

03:01.321 --> 03:03.755
a little less squinty
than the other squints.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.290
I just hide it better.

03:05.325 --> 03:06.457
Is there an I.D.?

03:06.493 --> 03:07.493
Not yet.

03:07.527 --> 03:08.893
What have we got?

03:08.929 --> 03:10.595
HODGINS:
Well, this lab is so sterile,

03:10.630 --> 03:12.263
there isn't a single bug
on the body.

03:12.299 --> 03:14.432
It was all eaten by the rats.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.767
Rats? Wait,
I don't see any rats.

03:15.802 --> 03:17.702
Yeah, I know, 'cause most of
them died-- poor little things.

03:17.737 --> 03:21.572
Their stomachs burst from
sudden intake of so much food.

03:21.608 --> 03:23.308
I had the techs take
the three survivors

03:23.343 --> 03:24.375
back to the Jeffersonian.

03:24.411 --> 03:25.576
I was afraid you'd say that.

03:25.612 --> 03:26.744
What do you mean?
Come on, now.

03:26.780 --> 03:27.780
There might actually be

03:27.814 --> 03:28.846
some evidence
in their excrement.

03:28.882 --> 03:30.114
Well, just keep the rats

03:30.150 --> 03:31.883
and the feces
in your office, please.

03:31.918 --> 03:33.618
No problem. Will do.

03:33.653 --> 03:35.820
Based on the cyanotic tinge
of the tissue,

03:35.855 --> 03:37.255
I'd say time of death was

03:37.290 --> 03:39.324
approximately 48 hours ago.

03:39.359 --> 03:41.159
The broad mandibular arc

03:41.194 --> 03:43.161
indicates the victim is male,

03:43.196 --> 03:44.529
and based on the shape

03:44.564 --> 03:45.797
of the distal tibia,

03:45.832 --> 03:47.065
in his late teens.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.299
Probably an undergraduate.

03:48.335 --> 03:49.734
AUBREY:
Well, I talked to security.

03:49.769 --> 03:51.202
Kids who found the body used

03:51.237 --> 03:53.004
a friend's key card to get in,

03:53.039 --> 03:55.306
but nobody else opened the door
since Friday.

03:55.342 --> 03:56.941
Look at this window.

03:56.977 --> 03:59.444
The, uh, rubber sealant's
been peeled off,

03:59.479 --> 04:02.947
and someone threaded a wire
through there and opened it.

04:02.983 --> 04:04.882
Which means, the victim
was killed elsewhere.

04:04.918 --> 04:06.150
This was a body dump.

04:06.186 --> 04:07.919
Look at all these rat cages.

04:07.954 --> 04:09.087
They've all
been broken into.

04:09.122 --> 04:10.588
BRENNAN:
Yes, it's quite ingenious.

04:10.623 --> 04:11.756
I think the killer knew

04:11.791 --> 04:13.558
the rats would eat evidence.

04:13.593 --> 04:14.859
HODGINS: And that
they'd eat a lot of it.

04:14.894 --> 04:16.761
The rats were
being starved to observe

04:16.796 --> 04:18.930
the effects
on Pavlovian conditioning.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.331
AUBREY:
You mean, the rats, like,

04:20.367 --> 04:22.567
hear a bell, and then
their body expects food?

04:22.602 --> 04:24.502
Well, yeah, the, uh,
sound of a bell

04:24.537 --> 04:26.537
can make a lab rat
do pretty much anything.

04:26.573 --> 04:29.007
Yeah, well,
they do have very small brains.

04:29.042 --> 04:30.341
(phone rings)

04:31.378 --> 04:34.212

05:13.921 --> 05:16.215
Well, the killer was pretty
smart to dump the body

05:16.218 --> 05:17.784
where he or she knew
it would get eaten.

05:17.820 --> 05:18.952
Do you think it was
a Lynwood student?

05:18.988 --> 05:20.220
If it was, then we're dealing

05:20.256 --> 05:22.022
with one of the smartest
kids in the country.

05:22.057 --> 05:23.891
Come on, you don't think
you can take on a college kid?

05:23.926 --> 05:25.826
Oh, we stand a chance.

05:25.861 --> 05:29.062
See, an adolescent's prefrontal
cortex isn't fully developed.

05:29.098 --> 05:31.365
So even with high IQs,
they're bound to make a mistake.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.534
Wow. Okay, even if they're
smart, they're stupid.

05:34.570 --> 05:35.869
When did you
become a squint?

05:35.905 --> 05:37.070
Oh, I've been spending
a lot of time

05:37.106 --> 05:38.138
with Jessica lately.

05:38.173 --> 05:39.706
And she turned me on
to these podcasts.

05:39.742 --> 05:41.241
You know, they've got
a podcast for everything.

05:41.277 --> 05:42.442
There's a bacteria...
I don't really...

05:42.478 --> 05:43.710
that does mind control.

05:43.746 --> 05:45.245
I don't need to know
about any of that.

05:45.281 --> 05:47.648
I just need to know
a list of potential suspects.

05:47.683 --> 05:50.183
I don't need to know
about podcasts or bacteria.

05:50.219 --> 05:53.086
There's a lesion
in the intestinal lining.

05:53.122 --> 05:54.421
The victim had an ulcer.

05:54.456 --> 05:55.589
He also chewed
his fingernails,

05:55.624 --> 05:57.958
which is another
indicator of stress.

05:57.993 --> 05:59.259
Well, Lynwood is

05:59.295 --> 06:01.328
a highly competitive
environment.

06:01.363 --> 06:03.297
I'll do a tox screen
on the intestines.

06:03.332 --> 06:05.065
Welcome to

06:05.100 --> 06:06.934
the forensic platform,
Ms. Mills.

06:06.969 --> 06:08.702
I've been waiting five years
to hear that.

06:08.737 --> 06:10.037
SAROYAN:
Me, too.

06:10.072 --> 06:11.371
I'm glad your work-study program

06:11.407 --> 06:13.707
here at the Jeffersonian
finally paid off.

06:13.742 --> 06:16.543
Yeah, I can't say I enjoyed
scrubbing the museum's toilets,

06:16.578 --> 06:19.513
but if it got me here,
it was worth it.

06:19.548 --> 06:20.747
Let's begin.

06:20.783 --> 06:23.083
Okay,
I will leave you to it.

06:23.118 --> 06:26.853
And again, Ms. Mills,
it's great to have you on board.

06:26.889 --> 06:27.988
Thanks.

06:28.023 --> 06:30.924
Okay, what do you make

06:30.960 --> 06:34.161
of the fracture
on the occipital?

06:34.196 --> 06:36.596
Oh, uh, that's trauma.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.867
That is accurate,

06:40.903 --> 06:43.537
however,
could you be more specific?

06:43.572 --> 06:45.672
Would you agree
that this is blunt force trauma?

06:45.708 --> 06:47.040
Definitely.

06:49.878 --> 06:52.679
Well, this fracture is shallow,
and insubstantial,

06:52.715 --> 06:54.314
suggesting it is
not cause of death.

06:54.350 --> 06:56.149
I agree.
He hit his head hard,

06:56.185 --> 06:57.517
but it didn't kill him.

07:01.590 --> 07:03.390
Now that you're an intern,

07:03.425 --> 07:05.525
Ms. Mills, your job is not

07:05.561 --> 07:07.461
to rephrase my words,

07:07.496 --> 07:10.063
but to come up
with findings of your own.

07:10.099 --> 07:13.567
I will do my best. I promise.

07:13.602 --> 07:15.936
I am so excited
about this opportunity.

07:15.971 --> 07:17.404
As am I.

07:17.439 --> 07:19.006
Please clean the bones
and rearticulate them.

07:19.041 --> 07:21.541
I can totally do that.

07:26.849 --> 07:29.383
(squeaking)

07:31.787 --> 07:33.754
I finished
the facial reconstruction,

07:33.789 --> 07:36.757
and I'm running it through
the Lynwood student database.

07:36.792 --> 07:40.560
Do these rats really need
a five-star hotel?

07:40.596 --> 07:42.029
Hey, they've been through hell.

07:42.064 --> 07:43.930
I'm gonna do what I can
to get them healthy.

07:43.966 --> 07:45.799
Honey, they're rats.

07:45.834 --> 07:47.868
That doesn't mean
I should give up on them.

07:47.903 --> 07:49.770
(phone rings)
Ooh.

07:49.805 --> 07:53.607
Uh, hey, we got an ID
from the facial reconstruction.

07:55.811 --> 07:57.410
Scott Hill.

07:57.446 --> 08:01.281
Sophomore
from Harwood, Missouri.

08:03.552 --> 08:06.019
(knocking on door)
AUBREY: <i>McKay Nield?</i>

08:06.054 --> 08:07.320
BOOTH:
<i>Are you Scott Hill's roommate?</i>

08:07.356 --> 08:09.055
Yeah, I am.

08:09.091 --> 08:11.725
Whatever this is,
I've got a final coming up, so.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.526
Look, I'm, uh,
sorry to tell you this,

08:13.562 --> 08:16.229
but, uh, your roommate
was found dead last night.

08:16.265 --> 08:18.465
That's awful.

08:19.935 --> 08:23.637
But I just need
to study right now, so.

08:23.672 --> 08:25.939
My partner just told you
that your friend is dead.

08:25.974 --> 08:27.140
I've got this final.

08:27.175 --> 08:29.476
Besides, we weren't that close.

08:29.511 --> 08:30.644
You two lived together.

08:30.679 --> 08:32.245
We didn't get
in each other's way.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.414
That's why it worked.
All right, Scott was killed.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.482
Can you think of anybody
who'd want to hurt him?

08:36.518 --> 08:38.952
No, I'm sorry.
I barely saw him.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.553
He was always singing with
his group, The Whippersnaps.

08:40.589 --> 08:44.090
Whippersnaps, right.
What kind of name is that?

08:44.126 --> 08:46.286
They're a, uh, a cappella group,
really good, actually.

08:49.031 --> 08:51.031
Did he spend a lot of his time
with The Whippersnaps?

08:51.066 --> 08:53.700
People would do anything
to be part of that group.

08:53.735 --> 08:55.802
It was his whole life.

08:59.241 --> 09:01.007
BRENNAN:
<i>Hi.</i>

09:01.043 --> 09:02.642
Parker, is everything okay?

09:02.678 --> 09:05.045
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you
about this summer.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.713
Your camping trip
with your father?

09:06.748 --> 09:08.148
Yeah, see there's this

09:08.183 --> 09:10.283
creative writing
summer session thing at Oxford

09:10.319 --> 09:11.518
I didn't think I'd get into.

09:11.553 --> 09:13.453
But you did?

09:13.488 --> 09:15.055
Congratulations!

09:15.090 --> 09:16.556
Parker, that's-that's exciting.

09:16.591 --> 09:17.991
Yeah, it is, it is, I know.

09:18.026 --> 09:20.293
And, I mean,
I want to spend time with Dad,

09:20.329 --> 09:23.196
but I really, really want
to do this program.

09:24.232 --> 09:26.166
It's a difficult choice.

09:26.201 --> 09:28.101
Yeah, it is, and, see,

09:28.136 --> 09:29.469
I don't know how
to talk to Dad about it,

09:29.504 --> 09:31.471
and I don't want
to disappoint him,

09:31.506 --> 09:34.074
so please, Bones,
could you talk to him?

09:34.109 --> 09:36.409
I'll see what I can do.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.011
All right. Thanks, Bones.

09:38.046 --> 09:39.846
You're the best.

09:39.881 --> 09:41.548
(chuckles)

09:43.652 --> 09:46.119
I can't believe I'm finally
an intern at the Jeffersonian.

09:46.154 --> 09:47.554
I know, right?

09:47.589 --> 09:49.255
I haven't been prouder
since Michael Vincent

09:49.291 --> 09:52.392
correctly identified
a Coccinella septempunctata.

09:53.362 --> 09:55.428
The ladybug.
Oh.

09:58.066 --> 10:00.166
I found cause of death.

10:00.202 --> 10:01.368
No, no, Sammy, don't jump to...

10:01.403 --> 10:03.269
Dr. Brennan,

10:03.305 --> 10:04.637
I-I found a broken hyoid.

10:04.673 --> 10:05.772
That-that means our victim
was strangled.

10:05.807 --> 10:06.706
...conclusions.

10:06.742 --> 10:08.074
Ms. Mills,

10:08.110 --> 10:09.876
hypothesis is not fact.

10:09.911 --> 10:11.411
This fractured hyoid

10:11.446 --> 10:12.912
is likely cause of death,

10:12.948 --> 10:13.947
but we can't know
with any certainty

10:13.982 --> 10:15.115
till we look at it

10:15.150 --> 10:16.349
in further detail.

10:16.385 --> 10:18.118
Please take this
to the bone room

10:18.153 --> 10:20.587
and examine it
under the medio-cam.

10:20.622 --> 10:22.288
Right away.
And in addition,

10:22.324 --> 10:24.257
do not wave the remains around.

10:24.292 --> 10:25.258
They are fragile.

10:25.293 --> 10:28.561
Of course.

10:28.597 --> 10:29.929
(clattering)

10:30.999 --> 10:32.632
She's gonna do fine.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.268
I sincerely hope so.

10:35.937 --> 10:36.569
Oh.

10:36.605 --> 10:38.171
I'm fine.

10:38.206 --> 10:40.140
I'm fine. The remains are fine.

10:41.610 --> 10:43.877
Wrong way.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.783
Yeah.

10:51.453 --> 10:53.953
Whippersnaps, huh?

10:53.989 --> 10:55.622
Sounds like
a breakfast cereal.

10:55.657 --> 10:56.923
Singing is everything
to these kids.

10:56.958 --> 10:58.324
Once you're a Whippersnap,

10:58.360 --> 11:00.160
that's what
your entire life is about.

11:00.195 --> 11:01.961
Wow, okay, Aubrey,

11:01.997 --> 11:03.897
you really did your research
on this one.

11:03.932 --> 11:05.932
(clears throat) Well, it's
called the Internet, Booth.

11:05.967 --> 11:07.600
You should step
into the 21st century.

11:07.636 --> 11:09.335
You know what?
The internet?

11:09.371 --> 11:11.404
It's for social idiots,
people who don't have a life.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.839
Okay? I like
to go out and bowl.

11:12.874 --> 11:14.174
Ever been bowling?

11:14.209 --> 11:16.776

What is it with you,
Julian?

12:07.996 --> 12:09.829
You are pitchy,
and your snapping

12:09.865 --> 12:11.764
looks like weird chicken claws.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.234
Well, at least I can keep
my diva hand under control.

12:14.269 --> 12:15.702
Yeah, Jake.
You look like Mariah Carey's

12:15.737 --> 12:17.070
skaggy little sister.

12:17.105 --> 12:18.471
Uh, it's called passion,

12:18.507 --> 12:21.174
Ted, something no one
has ever felt for you.

12:21.209 --> 12:24.010
Really? 'Cause your dad
would disagree.

12:24.045 --> 12:25.445
All right, that's it. FBI.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.313
See that? Everybody. You.

12:27.349 --> 12:29.549
You replaced the director,
Scott, didn't you?

12:29.584 --> 12:30.850
Yes.

12:30.886 --> 12:32.418
Okay, well, we need to ask you
a few questions.

12:32.454 --> 12:34.187
Everybody else out.
Let's go. Move it.

12:34.222 --> 12:36.389
Oh, my God, Jake.
What did you do to Scott?

12:37.893 --> 12:39.626
Uh, you two want to stay?
Where were you Friday night?

12:39.661 --> 12:41.427
Here working, your Honor.
We were here.

12:41.463 --> 12:43.162
Yeah, you can work all you want.

12:43.198 --> 12:45.164
Still not getting you a solo
now that I'm in charge, so.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.268
You're only in charge because
apparently you killed Scott.

12:55.290 --> 12:56.719
You have quite
the temper, Jake.

12:57.529 --> 12:59.363
I just found out one
of my friends is dead.

12:59.398 --> 13:01.465
Plus, we have nationals
coming up.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.166
The NCACs?

13:03.202 --> 13:04.401
What? What's that?

13:04.436 --> 13:06.303
Nothing.

13:06.338 --> 13:07.671
The National Collegiate
A Cappella Competition.

13:07.706 --> 13:09.640
Our whole year leads up to this.

13:09.675 --> 13:11.241
We expect to win.

13:11.277 --> 13:13.277
We've been rehearsing
day and night.

13:13.312 --> 13:14.845
Why didn't you
report Scott missing?

13:14.880 --> 13:16.647
I didn't have time for that.

13:16.682 --> 13:18.315
Scott wasn't here,

13:18.350 --> 13:20.951
so I took control--
I did what I had to do.

13:20.986 --> 13:23.253
Scott dies, you take control.
That's convenient.

13:23.289 --> 13:24.755
Convenient?

13:24.790 --> 13:26.590
We just lost a tenor
right before Nationals.

13:26.625 --> 13:29.426
Where were you
on Friday night?

13:29.461 --> 13:31.895
In my room,
practicing my scales.

13:31.931 --> 13:35.432
You can ask anyone
in the dorm next door.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.134
I project.

13:37.169 --> 13:39.836
So, can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt Scott?

13:39.872 --> 13:42.572
Ian Johnson?

13:42.608 --> 13:44.274
He <i>was</i>
Scott's best friend,

13:44.310 --> 13:47.511
and Scott kicked him out
of the group a month ago.

13:47.546 --> 13:49.146
Why'd he kick him out?
No idea.

13:49.181 --> 13:51.548
But Ian was so upset.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.317
He left Lynwood.

13:55.921 --> 13:58.755
Dr. Hodgins, can you take
a look at something for me?

13:58.791 --> 14:01.858
Y-y-you are feeding
a rat with a bottle.

14:01.894 --> 14:03.660
Yeah. It's the only way
I can get him to eat.

14:03.696 --> 14:05.729
Their experiment
has been compromised.

14:05.764 --> 14:06.997
They no longer have a use.

14:07.032 --> 14:08.165
Okay, all right.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.400
What do you have to show me?

14:10.436 --> 14:11.468
I checked

14:11.503 --> 14:13.470
some tissue around the...

14:13.505 --> 14:15.138
Oh.

14:15.174 --> 14:18.575
...hyoid for ligature marks,
and I found this.

14:18.610 --> 14:20.944
I think it's a splinter.

14:20.980 --> 14:22.546
Let me see.

14:22.581 --> 14:25.816
It looks like wood to me.

14:27.086 --> 14:29.753
Well, this alignment
of tracheids,

14:29.788 --> 14:31.888
and also fibers
and the vessel elements,

14:31.924 --> 14:33.357
tells me that it's oak.

14:33.392 --> 14:36.827
Huh. Got anything else for me?

14:36.862 --> 14:38.862
No, but I did find
a bacteria in the larynx

14:38.897 --> 14:40.397
that I couldn't identify.

14:40.432 --> 14:41.932
You think it had something
to do with the murder?

14:41.967 --> 14:43.567
In my experience,
anything out of the ordinary

14:43.602 --> 14:44.868
is worth looking into.

14:44.903 --> 14:46.770
Okay.

14:46.805 --> 14:48.271
Good boy.

15:00.152 --> 15:02.419
Looks like being
a Whippersnap

15:02.454 --> 15:04.554
is a family tradition.

15:04.590 --> 15:07.791
That was from my era--
class of '76.

15:07.826 --> 15:10.227
The best times of my life.
William Johnson.

15:10.262 --> 15:11.962
Ian's father.
Mm-hmm.

15:11.997 --> 15:13.497
We just heard about
Scott's death. Truly a shame.

15:13.532 --> 15:16.033
Right, well, I can see
the group meant a lot to you.

15:16.068 --> 15:18.568
You must have been pretty upset
when Scott kicked Ian out.

15:18.604 --> 15:19.836
I was shocked.

15:19.872 --> 15:22.305
I was good in my day, but Ian,

15:22.341 --> 15:24.441
I have never in my life
heard a voice like his.

15:24.476 --> 15:26.476
So you were angry at Scott?

15:26.512 --> 15:28.078
I was director once, myself.

15:28.113 --> 15:29.746
I have to respect
the current director.

15:29.782 --> 15:31.748
Ian understood that as well.

15:31.784 --> 15:32.949
Well, we'll need
to hear that from Ian.

15:32.985 --> 15:34.451
We can see him right now.

15:34.486 --> 15:36.019
We? Whoa, whoa,
he's-he's not a minor.

15:36.055 --> 15:37.554
I don't think he needs
dad to hold his hand.

15:37.589 --> 15:39.523
I'm his dad,
but I'm also a lawyer.

15:39.558 --> 15:42.426
I'd be a lot more comfortable
if I were present.

This is the guy
that Scott kicked out?

15:59.244 --> 16:00.610
Clearly wasn't
because of his voice.

16:00.646 --> 16:02.112
That's like butter.

16:02.147 --> 16:03.747
It always comes down to food
with you, doesn't it?

16:03.782 --> 16:04.915
Ian.

16:06.785 --> 16:09.519
These men are here from the FBI
to talk to you about Scott.

16:09.555 --> 16:11.455
(clears throat)

16:14.293 --> 16:16.493
I can't believe
someone did this.

16:16.528 --> 16:18.161
We just need to ask you
a few questions.

16:18.197 --> 16:19.796
When was the last time
you saw Scott?

16:19.832 --> 16:21.698
Not since he kicked me
out of the group.

16:21.733 --> 16:23.033
Hmm, you two were best friends.

16:23.068 --> 16:24.508
That must have
made you pretty angry.

16:24.536 --> 16:26.169
That's a bit of
a leading question, isn't it?

16:26.205 --> 16:27.804
We could always go down
to the FBI if you'd like.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.939
All I want to do is sing.

16:28.974 --> 16:31.641
Okay, Scott took
that away from me.

16:31.677 --> 16:33.110
So why'd he kick you
out of the group?

16:33.145 --> 16:34.811
He said I wasn't cutting it,

16:34.847 --> 16:36.513
but that made no sense.
I don't know.

16:36.548 --> 16:37.981
He was acting weird.

16:38.016 --> 16:39.182
He was keeping secrets.

16:39.218 --> 16:40.650
Secrets, what kind of secrets?

16:40.686 --> 16:42.252
I told you, I don't know.

16:42.287 --> 16:44.254
I don't know
what he was up to.

16:44.289 --> 16:46.022
I don't know why he kicked me
out of the Whippersnaps,

16:46.058 --> 16:47.657
and now I never will.

16:47.693 --> 16:49.226
Where were you Friday night?

16:49.261 --> 16:51.461
I was here.
Is there any way you can prove that?

16:51.497 --> 16:53.296
I-I was... I was home alone.

16:53.332 --> 16:54.965
We have security cameras
all the way around the house.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.700
If he left,
you'd see it in the tapes.

16:56.735 --> 16:58.602
Great. We're gonna
need those tapes,

16:58.637 --> 16:59.903
so we can clear your son.

16:59.938 --> 17:02.572
I swear, I would never do this.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.945
Hey!
Hey, Angie.

17:09.982 --> 17:11.548
I just picked up
our voicemails from home,

17:11.583 --> 17:15.519
and, uh, a Dr. Amir Hoffman
called for you.

17:15.554 --> 17:17.119
He did? What did he say?

17:17.156 --> 17:20.857
Yeah. He said, uh, he had some
good news about a new study.

17:20.893 --> 17:23.193
Oh, yes,
I was probably admitted.

17:23.228 --> 17:24.694
Uh, what is this about?

17:24.730 --> 17:27.130
Dr. Hoffman has
an experimental surgery

17:27.165 --> 17:28.932
for nerve regeneration.

17:28.967 --> 17:31.034
Surgery?

17:31.069 --> 17:32.769
Yeah, so I can walk again.

17:37.843 --> 17:39.943
Angela,

17:39.978 --> 17:42.679
you do realize
that I still can't walk?

17:42.714 --> 17:44.748
I know that.

17:44.783 --> 17:46.383
But surgery?

17:46.418 --> 17:47.584
We-we have to talk about this.

17:47.619 --> 17:49.452
I mean, there are risks.

17:52.024 --> 17:55.959
I just gave you amazing news,
and all you can be is skeptical.

17:55.994 --> 17:57.627
No, I-I-I want more information

17:57.663 --> 17:59.863
before you risk everything
on an experiment.

17:59.898 --> 18:01.198
Well, it's not your decision
to make, it's mine,

18:01.233 --> 18:02.766
and I'm getting my legs back.

18:10.342 --> 18:13.910
I found this fracturing
on the fifth rib.

18:13.946 --> 18:17.314
Oh, note that
the damage occurred

18:17.349 --> 18:19.149
on both
the posterior vertebral

18:19.184 --> 18:20.850
and anterior
sternal surfaces.

18:20.886 --> 18:22.385
What does that tell us?

18:22.421 --> 18:25.188
That there's fracturing
on both front and back.

18:25.224 --> 18:26.890
I'm familiar
with the definitions

18:26.925 --> 18:28.959
of anterior and posterior.

18:28.994 --> 18:31.428
Sorry.

18:31.463 --> 18:33.897
The corresponding fractures
indicate

18:33.932 --> 18:37.400
that force was applied
to the victim's chest

18:37.436 --> 18:39.469
while his body
was pressed against

18:39.504 --> 18:41.137
an unyielding, hard object.

18:41.173 --> 18:42.472
What did you find

18:42.507 --> 18:43.740
from the hyoid fracture?

18:43.775 --> 18:46.576
Oh, I believe that
is a comminuted fracture.

18:46.612 --> 18:47.612
I concur.

18:47.646 --> 18:49.312
The fracture's on the midline

18:49.348 --> 18:50.547
of the hyoid body,

18:50.582 --> 18:52.682
as opposed
to the greater cornua.

18:52.718 --> 18:54.884
I posit that
the victim was struck

18:54.920 --> 18:56.586
in the neck
with a solid object,

18:56.622 --> 18:57.854
which fractured his hyoid

18:57.889 --> 18:59.656
and caused him
to suffocate.

18:59.691 --> 19:00.691
I concur.

19:00.726 --> 19:01.825
Ms. Mills.

19:01.860 --> 19:03.627
I do not need your approbation.

19:03.662 --> 19:05.128
You were brought
on as an intern

19:05.163 --> 19:06.696
to contribute
to our process.

19:06.732 --> 19:09.099
If I must babysit you,
you become a hindrance,

19:09.134 --> 19:11.368
and I-I just can't have that.

19:11.403 --> 19:14.271
No, I'm sorry, Dr. Brennan.

19:14.306 --> 19:16.906
I can do this. I promise.

19:22.748 --> 19:24.147
So you really think
that looking

19:24.182 --> 19:25.448
at this kid's playlist

19:25.484 --> 19:26.950
is going to help us
find his killer?

19:26.985 --> 19:29.052
Yeah, music gets you
inside of someone's head.

19:29.087 --> 19:30.587
I can prove it.

19:30.622 --> 19:34.124
See, Ian said that Scott
was acting strange recently,

19:34.159 --> 19:36.159
so I looked into the music
that he's been arranging,

19:36.194 --> 19:38.361
and I found this.

19:38.397 --> 19:40.330
Yeah,
this is gibberish to me.

19:40.365 --> 19:41.998
Oh, it's completely different

19:42.034 --> 19:43.967
than anything
the Whippersnaps have ever done.

19:44.002 --> 19:46.870
The orchestration
is totally original.

19:46.905 --> 19:48.972
The interplay between voice
parts is complex and dynamic.

19:49.007 --> 19:51.708
Not to mention,
this half-step modulation.

19:51.743 --> 19:53.310
It's crazy.

19:53.345 --> 19:56.579
Yeah, okay, uh, what is
going on with you here?

19:56.615 --> 19:58.915
What do you mean?
The interplay between voice parts

19:58.950 --> 20:01.651
is complex and dynamic?

20:01.687 --> 20:03.453
It sounds like you know
a little bit more

20:03.488 --> 20:04.721
about this
than you're letting on.

20:04.756 --> 20:06.389
Okay. (clears throat)

20:06.425 --> 20:08.325
Look, I'm gonna level with you,
but you gotta promise

20:08.360 --> 20:09.826
that you're not gonna
mention anything.

20:09.861 --> 20:12.395
Uh, okay.

20:12.431 --> 20:14.931
Okay.

20:14.966 --> 20:17.300
I, uh,

20:17.336 --> 20:18.768
(whispering):
I sang a cappella.

20:18.804 --> 20:20.670
In college.

20:20.706 --> 20:22.772
Oh, uh, cool. Uh, so?

20:22.808 --> 20:24.808
So? So I don't want
Booth to find out.

20:24.843 --> 20:26.142
He's going to mock me.

20:26.178 --> 20:27.877
I got a manly reputation
to protect here.

20:27.913 --> 20:28.845
Yes, right.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.880
Of course, you do.

20:30.916 --> 20:34.150
Look, okay, whatever
was going on with this kid,

20:34.186 --> 20:36.419
it's gonna show up in his music.

20:36.455 --> 20:37.587
(sighs) Okay.

20:37.622 --> 20:40.190
Let's look.

20:40.225 --> 20:41.791
Oh, "For Liz."

20:41.827 --> 20:43.426
Huh, that's interesting.

20:43.462 --> 20:45.195
It's his newest playlist.

20:45.230 --> 20:46.329
Love songs.

20:46.365 --> 20:47.897
A sex playlist, maybe?

20:47.933 --> 20:49.399
Let me check the metadata

20:49.434 --> 20:51.901
and see if we can access
where he was listening to it.

20:55.807 --> 20:57.440
Nickerson Hall.

20:57.476 --> 20:59.209
Huh, the English department.

20:59.244 --> 21:02.412
Not exactly the sexiest place
for a hookup, but okay.

21:02.447 --> 21:03.413
Hmm.

21:03.448 --> 21:04.748
Oh, okay,

21:04.783 --> 21:06.549
this is the Lynwood
security footage.

21:06.585 --> 21:09.018
Hopefully we can find something
from one of those nights.

21:09.955 --> 21:11.154
That's him.

21:11.189 --> 21:12.355

21:50.662 --> 21:54.197
She's a Gingersnap-- they're
like the female Whippersnaps.

21:54.232 --> 21:55.799
Okay, well, the question is

22:06.678 --> 22:08.945
They weren't hooking up.

22:08.980 --> 22:11.981
Then what were two college kids
doing in a closet every night?

22:12.017 --> 22:13.483
AUBREY:

that high "G" flat.
Oh, I didn't know that.

22:27.671 --> 22:29.304
Research.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.006
See, this, uh,
Whippersnap arrangement

22:31.041 --> 22:32.975
calls for
a belted "G" flat.

22:33.010 --> 22:34.510
Scott kicked Ian
out of the Whippersnaps

22:34.545 --> 22:35.911
to make room for you,
didn't he?

22:35.946 --> 22:37.613
BOOTH:
So Scott's big secret here

22:37.648 --> 22:39.681
was to have a girl
in the group, right?

22:39.717 --> 22:41.750
He wanted to do
a big reveal at Nationals

22:41.785 --> 22:43.552
with press
and everything--

22:43.587 --> 22:45.954
the first female Whippersnap.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.823
That's why we were
hiding our rehearsals.

22:47.858 --> 22:49.191
But Scott didn't care about
gender equality, did he?

22:49.226 --> 22:50.826
He cared about winning.

22:50.861 --> 22:53.328
BOOTH: Right, exactly, you
found out his true intentions.

22:53.364 --> 22:55.063
You got pissed off,
and you killed him.

22:55.099 --> 22:56.099
No.

22:56.133 --> 22:57.232
The truth is

22:57.268 --> 22:58.967
I knew what Scott wanted,

22:59.003 --> 23:01.870
but it was a chance
to break new ground and...

23:01.906 --> 23:03.305
that's good for women,
isn't it?

23:03.340 --> 23:04.640
Well, that's a hell
of a justification

23:04.675 --> 23:06.975
for screwing over
your teammates.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.510
(sighs)
I swear, I didn't kill him.

23:08.546 --> 23:09.611
AUBREY:
Well, any idea who did?

23:09.647 --> 23:11.246
I don't know,

23:11.282 --> 23:12.814
but I know if people found out,

23:12.850 --> 23:14.216
my group, his group,

23:14.251 --> 23:16.919
it could piss
a lot of people off.

23:22.726 --> 23:24.092
You have something for me?

23:24.128 --> 23:26.128
I found fracturing on both

23:26.163 --> 23:28.230
olecranon processes
of the ulnae.

23:28.265 --> 23:30.632
Wait... ulnas?

23:30.668 --> 23:33.735
And why are you showing me
and not Dr. Brennan?

23:33.771 --> 23:36.038
Well, I just wanted
to run it by you.

23:36.073 --> 23:38.273
I mean, you're the boss.

23:38.309 --> 23:40.876
Ms. Mills, you can't be afraid
to go to Dr. Brennan.

23:42.646 --> 23:45.314
That said, what did you find?

23:45.349 --> 23:48.083
Well, we know our victim
was being attacked,

23:48.118 --> 23:49.418
so his instinct
would have been

23:49.453 --> 23:50.819
to protect his face.

23:50.854 --> 23:52.321
So the weapon hit
the olecranon processes,

23:52.356 --> 23:54.456
fracturing the elbows.

23:54.491 --> 23:55.991
So these are defensive wounds.

23:56.026 --> 23:58.293
I believe so, yes.
Okay.

23:58.329 --> 24:00.262
I'll see if I can find
evidence of the murder weapon

24:00.297 --> 24:01.897
in the corresponding tissue.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.001
Great work, Ms. Mills.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.273
(chuckles)

24:13.110 --> 24:14.610
BRENNAN:
<i>You know, um...</i>

24:14.645 --> 24:16.678
Parker called me.

24:16.714 --> 24:18.013
He said he wants to do

24:18.048 --> 24:20.148
a creative writing program
this summer.

24:20.184 --> 24:22.050
Wait a second, what?

24:22.086 --> 24:24.453
Instead of hiking
the Appalachian Trail with me?

24:24.488 --> 24:26.221
He's an excellent writer, Booth.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.624
Yeah, I... but summer
is all about having fun.

24:28.659 --> 24:29.659
Well, it might be

24:29.693 --> 24:31.560
equally fun for him to focus

24:31.595 --> 24:34.262
on a specific area
of his academic interest.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.398
Why did he come
to you about this?

24:36.433 --> 24:37.499
I don't know.

24:37.534 --> 24:39.901
My assumption is that he feels

24:39.937 --> 24:41.203
that I can understand
his predicament.

24:41.238 --> 24:42.404
Wait, predicament?

24:42.439 --> 24:43.772
Look, Bones,
I love you and all,

24:43.807 --> 24:45.374
but this decision
isn't up to you.

24:45.409 --> 24:46.441
I know...

24:46.477 --> 24:49.878
but isn't it up to Parker?

24:52.983 --> 24:54.449
HODGINS:
<i>Um, did you find</i>

24:54.485 --> 24:57.285
any news out
on that strange bacteria?

24:57.321 --> 24:58.620
It's a rare type
of streptococcus.

24:58.656 --> 24:59.788
MONTENEGRO:
Well, that is not good

24:59.823 --> 25:01.056
for a singer.

25:01.091 --> 25:02.324
Yeah, I called
the university

25:02.359 --> 25:03.492
health center.

25:03.527 --> 25:05.127
Scott and five
other Whippersnaps

25:05.162 --> 25:06.294
checked themselves in

25:06.330 --> 25:09.164
a month ago with
an unidentifiable

25:09.199 --> 25:10.432
strep-like infection.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.500
Unidentifiable?

25:11.535 --> 25:12.768
Well, that's scary.

25:12.803 --> 25:13.902
And suspicious,

25:13.937 --> 25:15.404
so I called labs in the area

25:15.439 --> 25:17.272
to see if anyone
was familiar with it.

25:17.307 --> 25:20.342
Turns out the biomedical
research lab at Lynwood

25:20.377 --> 25:23.245
wasn't only familiar with it--
they created it.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.746
MONTENEGRO:
All right,

25:24.782 --> 25:26.982
well, let's see
who had access.

25:27.017 --> 25:29.351
Wait a second.

25:29.386 --> 25:30.686
This is the Whippersnap's

25:30.721 --> 25:33.989
rival group, The Gingersnaps.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.958
HODGINS: One of
the research fellows

25:36.994 --> 25:39.561
at the biomedical lab
was a Gingersnap?

25:39.596 --> 25:42.297
Esther Hines.

25:42.332 --> 25:46.435
Look, Officer, there must
be some kind of a mistake.

25:46.470 --> 25:48.637
Okay, the title is Agent.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.139
I'll call you whatever
you want to be called.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.607
Save that for
your professors, Esther.

25:52.643 --> 25:53.942
That's not gonna work here.

25:53.977 --> 25:55.644
Now, let's talk about
how you infected

25:55.679 --> 25:57.512
those Whippersnaps with strep.

25:57.548 --> 25:59.181
That's ridiculous.
You're one of ten people

25:59.216 --> 26:01.183
with access to the bacteria,

26:01.218 --> 26:02.918
the gestation period
of which is three days.

26:02.953 --> 26:04.052
Now...

26:04.088 --> 26:05.887
look what happened
three days before

26:05.923 --> 26:07.122
the Whippersnaps
checked themselves

26:07.157 --> 26:08.390
into the health center.

26:08.425 --> 26:09.725
Didn't know it was a crime

26:09.760 --> 26:11.193
to kiss multiple guys
in one night.

26:11.228 --> 26:14.463
I wonder what Lynwood's
expulsion policy

26:14.498 --> 26:16.865
is on bioterrorism.

26:24.842 --> 26:27.409
Okay, I gave them strep.

26:27.444 --> 26:30.145
Because you wanted
to take out the competition.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.780
Okay, I was tired
of The Whippersnaps

26:31.815 --> 26:33.348
getting all the big bookings,

26:33.383 --> 26:35.617
so I put a sample
of the disease in my lip gloss

26:35.652 --> 26:36.618
and I made out with them.

26:36.653 --> 26:38.420
Scott stole your soloist,

26:38.455 --> 26:39.855
so you gave him an infection

26:39.890 --> 26:42.257
and then moved on
to something more severe.

26:42.292 --> 26:43.425
Back up.

26:43.460 --> 26:44.726
Scott did what?

26:44.762 --> 26:46.094
Are you telling me
you didn't know

26:46.130 --> 26:47.696
that Scott was poaching Liz?

26:47.731 --> 26:50.165
Okay, even if Scott
wanted Liz to join,

26:50.200 --> 26:51.800
she wouldn't have been able to.

26:51.835 --> 26:53.802
Their bylaws prohibit women.

26:53.837 --> 26:55.170
Scott was the director.

26:55.205 --> 26:56.271
He could have
just changed that.

26:56.306 --> 26:57.806
Okay, no, only the head

26:57.841 --> 26:59.975
of the Whippersnap Alumni
Foundation can do that.

27:00.010 --> 27:02.377
He's this old lawyer

27:02.412 --> 27:04.479
who is still weirdly obsessed
with The Whippersnaps.

27:04.515 --> 27:06.248
You talking
about William Johnson?

27:06.283 --> 27:07.516
Yeah.

27:07.551 --> 27:08.517
Anyways, he would never

27:08.552 --> 27:09.785
sign an amendment.

27:09.820 --> 27:11.219
How do you know that?

27:11.255 --> 27:13.655
Because I tried to get him
to sign it.

27:13.690 --> 27:15.791
I wanted to be a Whippersnap.

27:15.826 --> 27:18.627
I used my best
negotiation tactics,

27:18.662 --> 27:20.328
so trust me,

27:20.364 --> 27:22.464
if he said no to me,

27:22.499 --> 27:24.966
he definitely said no to Scott.

27:30.689 --> 27:32.598
SAROYAN:
<i>I ran histological tests</i>

27:32.698 --> 27:34.431
on the victim's bicep,

27:34.467 --> 27:36.066
and found a grouping

27:36.102 --> 27:37.134
of hemosiderin
laden macrophages.

27:37.170 --> 27:38.302
Meaning...

27:38.337 --> 27:40.171
Well, essentially, bruising.

27:40.206 --> 27:42.406
With microscopic imaging,
I was able to determine

27:42.441 --> 27:43.574
where under the skin

27:43.609 --> 27:44.909
the blood vessels burst.

27:46.779 --> 27:48.012
Hmm... looks like

27:48.047 --> 27:49.480
a hand print.
Exactly.

27:49.515 --> 27:51.715
Someone grabbed the victim
tight enough to leave a mark.

27:51.751 --> 27:53.384
Can you determine
the size of the hand?

27:53.419 --> 27:56.053
Yeah, since we know
the circumference of the bicep,

27:56.088 --> 27:59.623
I can overlay the placement
of the bruises.

28:03.496 --> 28:04.695
I'll send this to Booth.

28:04.730 --> 28:06.797
This could be
the hand of our killer.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.070
We established

28:13.105 --> 28:14.438
my son has an alibi.

28:14.473 --> 28:15.839
I don't see why you need
to question me further.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.675
We're not here
to talk about Ian.

28:17.710 --> 28:19.243
We're here to talk about you,
so have a seat.

28:19.278 --> 28:20.878
AUBREY: Please,
have a seat, Mr. Johnson.

28:23.249 --> 28:25.482
You neglected to tell us
that Scott approached you

28:25.518 --> 28:27.585
about changing
the Whippersnap bylaws.

28:27.620 --> 28:28.886
I fail to see
how that's relevant.

28:28.921 --> 28:30.187
It's relevant because
all of those years

28:30.223 --> 28:31.288
of tradition flushed

28:31.324 --> 28:32.856
down the toilet by some teenager

28:32.892 --> 28:34.525
is enough to drive a guy
to murder.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.859
That's ridiculous.

28:35.895 --> 28:37.494
Ridiculous? Prove it.

28:37.530 --> 28:40.231
AUBREY: See, the killer grabbed
the victim by the arm.

28:40.266 --> 28:41.365
If you're not the killer,

28:41.400 --> 28:43.467
then your handprint
won't match.

28:47.073 --> 28:50.507
Look, the handprint will match,

28:50.543 --> 28:51.709
but I didn't kill him.

28:51.744 --> 28:54.912
Well, something happened
between you two.

28:54.947 --> 28:57.748
The Whippersnap bylaws state
the group is all male,

28:57.783 --> 28:59.583
but he said
if I didn't let a woman in,

28:59.619 --> 29:02.119
he'd just change the name
to Whippersnappers.

29:02.154 --> 29:03.454
I was pissed.

29:03.489 --> 29:05.522
I grabbed him
and I told him I'd make sure

29:05.558 --> 29:07.558
the Whippersnappers
never made a penny,

29:07.593 --> 29:09.326
but I let him go, okay?

29:09.362 --> 29:11.328
Mm-mm, you're looking
pretty good for murder.

29:11.364 --> 29:14.598
Maybe you should take a look
at Julian Klein and Ted Gibbs.

29:14.634 --> 29:16.433
Why is that?
Back in September,

29:16.469 --> 29:18.969
they were running
for the same director position.

29:19.005 --> 29:21.305
Both were far more qualified
than Scott.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.440
You think Scott pulled
something crooked?

29:23.476 --> 29:26.010
My son told me
Scott blackmailed him.

29:26.045 --> 29:27.845
Said he'd expose
the fact that they

29:27.880 --> 29:29.480
had been buying
term papers.

29:35.054 --> 29:36.553
You wanted to see me,
Dr. Brennan?

29:36.589 --> 29:38.889
Ms. Mills, are these
the injuries you catalogued

29:38.924 --> 29:40.257
as defensive wounds?

29:40.293 --> 29:41.392
Yes.

29:41.427 --> 29:42.526
These are crushing fractures

29:42.561 --> 29:44.161
which suggest the victim

29:44.196 --> 29:45.863
fell backward
onto his elbows.

29:45.898 --> 29:46.898
That's right.

29:46.932 --> 29:48.165
I-I knew that.

29:49.802 --> 29:51.869
Why wasn't I informed about

29:51.904 --> 29:53.537
this fracturing?

29:53.572 --> 29:55.539
I catalogued it with
the victim's childhood injuries.

29:55.574 --> 29:57.207
Note the lack

29:57.243 --> 29:58.475
of remodeling.

29:58.511 --> 30:00.544
The fracturing on these bones

30:00.579 --> 30:01.745
is perimortem.

30:01.781 --> 30:03.147
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:03.182 --> 30:07.184
And they are parallel to
the hyoid and rib fractures,

30:07.219 --> 30:09.720
which indicates the killer
hit the victim one time,

30:09.755 --> 30:12.890
with one object,
such as a ladder,

30:12.925 --> 30:15.859
causing multiple
parallel contusions.

30:15.895 --> 30:16.960
I should have seen that.

30:16.996 --> 30:19.296
It was right in front of me.

30:19.332 --> 30:20.698
Your mistakes

30:20.733 --> 30:23.400
delayed the progress
of the investigation.

30:23.436 --> 30:24.935
I'm so sorry.

30:24.970 --> 30:26.170
It won't happen again.

30:26.205 --> 30:29.573
That is right,
Ms. Mills, because...

30:29.608 --> 30:31.108
I have to let you go.

30:33.145 --> 30:34.912
I know I can do better.

30:34.947 --> 30:38.615
That is conceivable,
but I can't take that chance.

30:46.892 --> 30:49.426

32:13.879 --> 32:15.312
(claps)
Hey! Quiet up.

32:15.347 --> 32:16.580
Let's-let's wrap
this up here.

32:16.615 --> 32:18.949
We have one day
to get ready.

32:18.984 --> 32:20.484
That's fantastic,
but I got a search warrant here

32:20.519 --> 32:21.652
that trumps
your little glee club,

32:21.687 --> 32:22.820
so everybody out.

32:22.855 --> 32:25.489
Move, move, uh-uh,
except you two.

32:25.524 --> 32:27.624
You two back up. Why?
What? Why?

32:27.660 --> 32:29.626
Because you were here the night
that Scott Hill was murdered.

32:29.662 --> 32:30.694
And the murder took place

32:30.729 --> 32:31.695
right here.

32:31.730 --> 32:33.263
Parallel rungs made of oak.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.731
Fits the weapon profile.

32:34.767 --> 32:36.667
Weapon profile?
What are you trying to say?

32:36.702 --> 32:38.769
You're both under arrest
for the murder of Scott Hill.

32:38.804 --> 32:39.903
We are not murderers.

32:39.939 --> 32:40.904
I-I cry at the end

32:40.940 --> 32:42.206
of <i>Legally Blonde Two.</i>

32:42.241 --> 32:43.761
Does that sound like
a murderer to you?

32:46.490 --> 32:48.638
We've got you two
at the scene of the crime

32:48.738 --> 32:50.183
on the day of Scott's murder.

32:50.184 --> 32:51.684
Oh, my God, are you serious?
I mean, we may...

32:51.718 --> 32:53.218
No, there's no...
...we may have been there at some point,

32:53.253 --> 32:54.286
I mean, look at us.
but we're there every single day.

32:54.321 --> 32:55.854
We sing, no, we do.
Yeah.

32:55.889 --> 32:57.088
Every day, and we have
And CICs are coming up.

32:57.124 --> 32:58.156
a show coming up.
We're rehearsing...

32:58.191 --> 32:59.457
I can't afford
to lose my voice...

32:59.493 --> 33:01.226
...every night, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday...

33:01.261 --> 33:02.627
AUBREY:
Okay, slow it down.

33:02.663 --> 33:03.795
Thank you.

33:03.830 --> 33:05.130
One at a time.

33:05.165 --> 33:06.998
Is there anyone who can account

33:07.034 --> 33:09.668
for where you were
on Friday night?

33:09.703 --> 33:10.669
Yeah, totally.
Yes.

33:10.704 --> 33:11.836
Okay, who?

33:11.872 --> 33:13.905
Him.
Him.

33:13.941 --> 33:16.508
Anyone who isn't a suspect
in this murder investigation?

33:16.543 --> 33:17.876
Oh...
Wait,

33:17.911 --> 33:19.344
we're actually
murder suspects?

33:19.379 --> 33:20.612
We didn't do this.

33:20.647 --> 33:22.447
Oh, my God,
I'm freaking out right now.

33:22.482 --> 33:23.482
Scott blackmailed you

33:23.517 --> 33:25.050
so he could become director.

33:25.085 --> 33:28.320
Yes, Scott blackmailed us,
but it was for the best.

33:28.355 --> 33:29.688
He was an amazing director.

33:29.723 --> 33:30.789
So, you admit that

33:30.824 --> 33:31.824
he blackmailed you?

33:31.858 --> 33:32.824
That must have made you angry.

33:32.859 --> 33:34.159
Well, I mean, at first,

33:34.194 --> 33:35.860
yeah, but after we saw
how good he was,

33:35.896 --> 33:37.495
we realized it was worth it.

33:37.531 --> 33:39.464
He even gave me
his anxiety medication

33:39.499 --> 33:41.466
before a concert
just to help me chill out.

33:41.501 --> 33:43.969
Hold on a second,
Scott gave you drugs?

33:44.004 --> 33:46.905
Well, yeah, yeah,
i-it-it was just medication,

33:46.940 --> 33:49.741
uh, uh, a friend
helping out a friend.

33:49.776 --> 33:51.209
You know, I...

33:51.244 --> 33:54.179
I tend to get really... um...

33:54.214 --> 33:56.781
do you... do you have
a paper bag?

33:56.817 --> 33:58.583
(hyperventilating)

33:58.618 --> 34:01.386
(gasps)

34:05.292 --> 34:07.192
MONTENEGRO:
<i>So, I measured the distance</i>

34:07.227 --> 34:09.260
from the injury
at the hyoid to the rib,

34:09.295 --> 34:11.396
and the rib injury
to the tibia.

34:11.431 --> 34:13.197
Well, in this case,
there'd be more injuries.

34:13.233 --> 34:14.866
What if the victim wasn't prone?

34:14.900 --> 34:18.069
If I adjust his body,
the ladder hits him

34:18.105 --> 34:19.838
in the right places.

34:19.873 --> 34:21.072
Well, this is possible,

34:21.108 --> 34:22.774
but I'll need
to examine further.

34:22.809 --> 34:25.275
Hey, little Copernicus
came through for us.

34:25.312 --> 34:28.013
Oh, I assume
you're talking about the rat,

34:28.047 --> 34:30.849
(laughing):
and not the astronomer.

34:30.884 --> 34:32.384
Yeah.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.018
Yes.

34:34.054 --> 34:35.353
Anyway, uh, I actually found

34:35.389 --> 34:37.554
wood in his feces,
and not just oak.

34:37.591 --> 34:39.724
There was maple,
pine and alder,

34:39.760 --> 34:41.893
which means that the weapon was
made of some compressed wood.

34:41.928 --> 34:43.460
The ladder from
Whipperspace is made

34:43.496 --> 34:44.795
of solid oak, so that can't

34:44.831 --> 34:46.598
be the murder weapon.
Ugh.

34:46.632 --> 34:48.166
So much for that.

34:48.201 --> 34:50.168
Hey, by the way,
where is Sammy?

34:50.203 --> 34:51.770
I haven't seen her
in a few hours.

34:51.804 --> 34:54.672
She made significant errors,
so I fired her.

34:55.409 --> 34:56.908
After a day?

34:56.943 --> 34:57.909
HODGINS:
Seriously?

34:57.944 --> 34:59.110
Come on now, I mean,

34:59.146 --> 35:00.412
everyone deserves
a second chance,

35:00.447 --> 35:01.546
especially one of our own.

35:01.581 --> 35:03.481
I am fond of Sammy as well,

35:03.517 --> 35:05.750
but I can't let
my personal feelings

35:05.786 --> 35:07.318
impede an investigation.

35:07.354 --> 35:08.720
Case in point.

35:08.755 --> 35:11.523
There's sharp force trauma
on the occipital

35:11.558 --> 35:14.192
which was obfuscated
by the blunt force trauma,

35:14.227 --> 35:15.560
but it should have been found.

35:15.595 --> 35:17.395
So, the victim was hit
with something?

35:17.431 --> 35:18.797
He was.

35:18.832 --> 35:21.032
Dr. Hodgins, can you swab
for particulates?

35:21.068 --> 35:22.467
You expect us
to work even though

35:22.502 --> 35:23.568
you just fired our friend?

35:23.603 --> 35:25.637
Thank you, yes.

35:29.543 --> 35:31.109
AUBREY:
<i>Hey, y'all ready</i>

35:31.144 --> 35:32.210
for your big camping trip?

35:32.245 --> 35:33.778
Okay,
just slow down, okay.

35:33.814 --> 35:35.847
This is not a "camping trip,"
you understand me?

35:35.882 --> 35:38.583
We are hiking
the Appalachian Trail.

35:38.618 --> 35:40.485
Hiking, got it.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.320
Parker must be stoked.

35:43.256 --> 35:44.656
What do you got?

35:44.691 --> 35:46.091
Well, listen,
the lab ruled out

35:46.126 --> 35:47.425
the Whippersnap ladder.

35:47.461 --> 35:49.327
All right, so we're back
to square one.

35:49.362 --> 35:50.728
Well, not exactly, see,
I found out that Scott

35:50.764 --> 35:52.564
had been scoring
anti-anxiety meds for Julian.

35:52.599 --> 35:54.432
Turns out Scott didn't have
a prescription.

35:54.468 --> 35:55.633
Ah, you know,
Scott would do anything

35:55.669 --> 35:56.968
for that group.

35:57.003 --> 35:58.736
Maybe that includes
buying drugs illegally.

35:58.772 --> 36:00.572
A campus full of geniuses
got to be loaded

36:00.607 --> 36:03.074
with anti-anxiety meds
and dealers.

36:03.110 --> 36:04.409
Sounds kind of pathetic,
if you ask me.

36:04.444 --> 36:06.177
You get
into a top ten university,

36:06.213 --> 36:07.545
and singing freaks you out?

36:07.581 --> 36:09.114
(scoffs)
Let's see you get up there

36:09.149 --> 36:10.281
and try it.

36:13.153 --> 36:14.819
I'm just saying.

36:18.225 --> 36:19.290
Hey.

36:19.326 --> 36:20.792
You wanted
to show me something?

36:20.827 --> 36:23.161
Yeah, so, I got the results
back from swabbing

36:23.196 --> 36:25.930
the sharp force trauma,
and check this out.

36:25.966 --> 36:28.466
I found traces
of olivine, pyroxine,

36:28.502 --> 36:31.436
and troilite, which got me
thinking of chondrules.

36:31.471 --> 36:34.072
Wow, they're beautiful,
aren't they?

36:34.107 --> 36:35.807
Very rare, too,
because chondrules

36:35.842 --> 36:37.876
are only found in meteorites.

36:39.579 --> 36:40.678
Wait, the victim's roommate

36:40.714 --> 36:42.881
is an astrophysics major

36:42.916 --> 36:45.283
with a focus
on planetary geology.

36:45.318 --> 36:46.951
Hey, then that actually means
that it's possible

36:46.987 --> 36:48.720
he had access
to meteorite samples.

36:48.755 --> 36:49.687
I'll call Booth.

36:49.723 --> 36:52.590
Uh, also, C-Cam...

36:52.626 --> 36:54.759
this whole Sammy thing,
any chance you can, you know,

36:54.794 --> 36:56.161
pull rank or anything?

36:56.196 --> 36:58.429
I mean, I feel like
we can get it to work.

36:58.465 --> 37:00.398
(sighs)

37:00.433 --> 37:03.434
Wanting things to work
and actually making things work

37:03.470 --> 37:07.172
are two very different things,
Dr. Hodgins.

37:14.014 --> 37:17.215
BRENNAN:
This is a meteorite sample.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.350
Blood.

37:19.386 --> 37:20.518
BOOTH:
Bones, what about this?

37:20.554 --> 37:21.886
What about the bookshelf?

37:21.922 --> 37:23.188
There's...
there's parallel bars.

37:23.223 --> 37:24.856
The wood is cheap.

37:24.891 --> 37:25.931
Could this have
killed him?

37:25.959 --> 37:27.325
Let me see.

37:33.227 --> 37:37.095
Yes, the spacings correlate
directly to the injuries.

37:37.131 --> 37:38.563
Wait a second,
I got motive.

37:38.599 --> 37:40.031
Empty bottle
of anxiety medicine

37:40.067 --> 37:41.500
made out to McKay Nield.

37:41.535 --> 37:43.635
You killed Scott because
he was stealing your meds.

37:43.670 --> 37:45.670
No.
BRENNAN: You threw the meteorite

37:45.706 --> 37:46.805
at his head.
No...

37:46.840 --> 37:48.473
that-that's not true.
I'm not a killer.

37:48.509 --> 37:51.209
It propelled him forward
into the bookshelf,

37:51.245 --> 37:53.979
disrupting its balance
and causing it to fall onto him.

37:54.014 --> 37:56.281
I-It was an accident.

37:56.316 --> 37:57.449
I had to give
a presentation

37:57.484 --> 37:59.151
for the astronomy
fellowship.

37:59.186 --> 38:02.087
Scott took my meds,
and I had a panic attack.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.458
That fellowship
meant everything to me,

38:06.493 --> 38:07.859
and I lost it because of him.

38:07.895 --> 38:09.060
So you killed him.
No.

38:09.096 --> 38:10.228
He pulled the shelf
on top of himself

38:10.264 --> 38:11.430
trying to get his balance.

38:12.366 --> 38:14.766
I... I didn't mean to.

38:14.802 --> 38:17.803
I'm sure you didn't mean to feed
his body to the rats, either.

I actually think these
little guys are gonna make it.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.099
(sighing):
Yeah.

38:48.135 --> 38:49.935
What?

38:49.970 --> 38:53.071
Well, I did some research
on that Dr. Hoffman.

38:53.106 --> 38:56.274
One of his patients died
during surgery.

38:56.310 --> 38:58.810
I know, Angela,
but that was two years ago.

38:58.846 --> 39:01.613
Look, you seem to care
a whole lot

39:01.648 --> 39:03.648
about those rats' lives,
and yet you don't even

39:03.684 --> 39:05.951
think twice
about risking your own.

39:05.986 --> 39:07.352
Come on,
this is different.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.621
I'm not really sure that it is.

39:09.656 --> 39:12.858
The entire colony died
because they were poked

39:12.893 --> 39:14.826
and-and-and prodded and

39:14.862 --> 39:16.728
tested on, and now you
just want to sign up

39:16.763 --> 39:18.897
to do the same thing
to yourself.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.871
You're right.

39:27.274 --> 39:29.841
You're right.

39:29.877 --> 39:31.243
I'm not gonna do the surgery.

39:33.313 --> 39:35.580
I just really wanted to find
something that worked.

39:37.284 --> 39:39.384
Well...

39:39.419 --> 39:42.521
we'll keep looking until
we find something that does.

39:44.191 --> 39:45.191
But for now we should...

39:45.225 --> 39:46.591
For now...

39:46.627 --> 39:48.760
we're fine.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.533
Okay.

40:01.275 --> 40:02.275
Hey, so, Angela,

40:02.309 --> 40:05.677
um, so, in terms of the rats...

40:05.712 --> 40:07.412
we can take them home
with us, right?

40:07.447 --> 40:08.713
Hodgins.

40:08.749 --> 40:10.549
Angela, you cannot
come into my office

40:10.584 --> 40:12.617
and do this whole speech
about the value of life

40:12.653 --> 40:14.352
and then send these poor
little guys back to Lynwood

40:14.388 --> 40:15.787
where they're gonna
get executed.

40:15.822 --> 40:16.755
Fine...

40:16.790 --> 40:18.156
but you are the one

40:18.191 --> 40:19.257
who's gonna be cleaning

40:19.293 --> 40:20.825
the poop out of those cages.

40:20.861 --> 40:22.561
You say that
as if it's a bad thing.

40:22.596 --> 40:24.563
(phone beeps)

40:24.598 --> 40:27.766
Oh, hey, Booth wants
us to come over.

40:27.801 --> 40:30.235
He says it's important.

40:34.408 --> 40:36.808
Are you gonna tell us
why we're here?

40:36.843 --> 40:39.010
Okay, I'm here,
what's the big emergency?

40:39.046 --> 40:40.245
Okay, I found
something important

40:40.280 --> 40:43.348
that we all must see.

40:43.383 --> 40:45.317
Ooh, I wonder what
it could be.

40:45.352 --> 40:47.052
Is this to do
with the murder?

40:47.087 --> 40:48.219
No, it's about one of us.

40:48.255 --> 40:49.921
Oh, is it...

40:49.957 --> 40:52.257
about Hodgins
or perhaps Cam?

40:52.292 --> 40:53.792
BOOTH:
No, it's uh...

40:53.827 --> 40:54.993
about Aubrey here.

40:55.028 --> 40:56.261
He is, uh--

40:56.296 --> 40:57.395
or was--

40:57.431 --> 40:59.297
hiding something from us.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.666
I found this in a pile

41:01.702 --> 41:04.603
of William Johnson's
a cappella junk.

41:04.638 --> 41:07.572
This is
the 2001 National Collegiate

41:07.608 --> 41:09.174

41:09.209 --> 41:10.475
Oh...
What could that be?

41:10.510 --> 41:11.943
Let's put that one in.
No, no, no,

41:11.979 --> 41:13.044
give me that,
that's evidence!

41:13.080 --> 41:15.180
No, no, no, no,
it is in,

41:15.215 --> 41:16.748

to roll, huh?

Well, that's an opinion
I'm certain my fans

41:54.354 --> 41:55.453
