00:00.870 --> 00:07.210
♫ We... are the crystal gems,
we'll always save the day, ♫

00:07.220 --> 00:11.880
♫ And if you think we can't,
we'll always find a way, ♫

00:12.340 --> 00:17.250
♫ That's why the people
of this world believe in, ♫

00:17.780 --> 00:22.780
♫ Garnet, Amethyst, and
Pearl... and Steven! ♫

00:23.350 --> 00:24.980
S01xE01 - "Gem Glow"

00:29.820 --> 00:32.630
Nooooooo!

00:32.860 --> 00:35.480
This can't be happening!
This has to be a dream!

00:35.940 --> 00:38.930
Lars! Lars!
Please tell me I'm dreaming!

00:38.950 --> 00:41.060
Get off me, man.
I'm stocking here.

00:41.950 --> 00:45.130
I'm sorry, Steven, I guess
they stopped making them.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.560
Stopped making them?

00:46.710 --> 00:49.180
Why in the world would
they stop making cookie cats?

00:49.410 --> 00:51.050
They are only the most
scrumptious and delicious

00:51.050 --> 00:52.600
ice-cream sandwich ever made!

00:52.960 --> 00:54.490
Don't they have laws for this?

00:54.990 --> 00:57.370
Tough bits, man.
Nobody buys them anymore.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.300
I guess they couldn't
compete with Lion Lickers.

01:01.650 --> 01:06.580
Not Lion Lickers! Nobody likes them!
They don't even look like lions!

01:06.680 --> 01:08.770
Kids these days - I'll tell you what!

01:08.840 --> 01:11.340
Well, if you miss your
wimpy ice cream so much,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.900
why don't you make some with
your magic belly button?

01:14.900 --> 01:16.620
That's not how it works, Lars.

01:17.150 --> 01:17.740
Right?

01:21.570 --> 01:25.150
Oh, sweet cookie cats, with
your crunchy cookie outside,

01:25.770 --> 01:29.700
your icy creamy insides, you
were too good for this world.

01:32.230 --> 01:33.690
Uh... Steven?

01:35.620 --> 01:37.460
Do you want to take
the freezer with you?

01:47.380 --> 01:49.450
Hey, guys! You won't believe this!

01:53.760 --> 01:54.640
'Sup, Steven?

02:09.770 --> 02:12.050
Awesome! What are these things?

02:12.330 --> 02:16.330
Ugh! Sorry, Steven. We'll get these
centipeetles out of your room.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.760
We think they were trying
to get into the temple.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.320
You don't have to get rid of them.
They are really cool!

02:30.470 --> 02:34.380
Um, you guys?
These things don't have gems.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.210
That means there must be
a mother somewhere nearby.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.830
We should probably find it
before anyone gets hurt.

02:42.150 --> 02:45.050
Ooh! Ooh! Can I come? Can I? Can I?

02:45.140 --> 02:48.590
Steven, until you learn to
control the powers in your gem,

02:48.590 --> 02:51.520
we'll take care of
protecting humanity, okay?

02:51.900 --> 02:53.340
Aw, man.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.570
Hey! Get out of there!
Go on! Shoo! Shoo!

02:58.280 --> 03:01.310
Aw! They got into everything!

03:02.270 --> 03:03.240
Not cool!

03:07.370 --> 03:10.150
No way! I-It can't be!

03:11.020 --> 03:12.930
What-- where did you get these?!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.500
I thought they stopped making them!

03:14.830 --> 03:18.330
Well, we heard that, too, and
since they are your favorite...

03:18.620 --> 03:20.270
We went out and stole a bunch.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.240
I went back and paid for them.

03:23.410 --> 03:25.460
The whole thing was my idea.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.670
It was everyone's idea.

03:26.890 --> 03:27.640
Not really.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.380
All that matters is
that Steven is happy.

03:31.010 --> 03:36.240
♫ Ahhhhhh! He's a frozen
treat with an all-new taste, ♫

03:36.370 --> 03:38.880
♫  'Cause he came to this planet
from outer space ♫

03:39.100 --> 03:44.240
♫ A refugee of an interstellar war
But now he is at your local grocery store ♫

03:44.390 --> 03:49.470
♫ Cookie cat, he's a pet for your tummy
Cookie cat, he's superduper yummy ♫

03:49.680 --> 03:55.020
♫ Cookie cat, he left his family behind
Cookie c-a-a-a-a-a-t! ♫

03:55.500 --> 03:57.740
Now available at
Gergins off Route 109.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.710
I can't believe you did this!
I'm gonna save these forever!

04:05.610 --> 04:06.640
Right after I eat this one.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.010
Hello, old friend.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.030
So good!

04:14.280 --> 04:15.730
I like to eat the ears first.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.310
Uh, Steven.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.310
Wha... my gem!

04:19.310 --> 04:21.390
Quick! Try and summon your weapon!

04:21.709 --> 04:22.670
I don't know how!

04:23.380 --> 04:26.330
Aah! It's fading!
How do I make it come back?!

04:26.350 --> 04:30.280
Calm down, Steven.
Breathe. Don't force it.

04:30.460 --> 04:33.390
Yeah. And try not to
poop yourself, either.

04:33.910 --> 04:35.070
Please, don't.

04:38.450 --> 04:41.330
Aw! I was really close that time!

04:42.930 --> 04:45.110
Can one of you just explain
how to summon a weapon?

04:45.380 --> 04:47.120
Oh! I'll go first!

04:49.280 --> 04:51.680
Pay attention to these petals, Steven.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.160
The petal's dance seems improvised,

04:54.530 --> 04:56.830
but it is being
calculated in real time,

04:56.830 --> 04:59.080
based on the physical
properties of this planet.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.040
With hard work and dedication, you
can master the magical properties

05:04.040 --> 05:07.150
of your gem and
perform your own dance!

05:15.340 --> 05:15.930
Like so.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.370
Did Pearl tell you the petal thing?

05:23.620 --> 05:28.530
Yeah. I need to practice really hard
so I can dance like a tree... I think.

05:29.020 --> 05:32.340
Listen, Steven. All that
practice stuff is no fun.

05:34.430 --> 05:37.960
Whenever I need to summon
my weapon, it just happens!

05:42.910 --> 05:44.940
See? Didn't try at all.

05:46.790 --> 05:47.490
Again?!

05:49.080 --> 05:52.540
So, I'm supposed to work really hard
and not try at all at the same time?

05:53.980 --> 05:54.440
Yes.

05:57.340 --> 06:01.730
Or... you can link you mind with
the energy of all existing matter,

06:02.100 --> 06:05.150
channeling the collective power
of the universe through your gem,

06:05.410 --> 06:06.360
which results in...

06:09.200 --> 06:10.640
At least that's my way of doing it.

06:14.660 --> 06:17.940
I think my best bet is to re-create what
happened the last time my gem glowed.

06:18.230 --> 06:20.740
So... Garnet and Amethyst were here.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.880
Pearl was next to the fridge.

06:23.530 --> 06:24.960
Hmm, hmm.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.370
Amethyst, I think your
arms were crossed.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.420
Okay, your majesty.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.080
And, Pearl, your foot was like this.

06:33.350 --> 06:35.080
I don't think it works
this way, Steven.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.790
And, Garnet... uh... uh... yeah.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.730
Then I took a bite of this cookie cat.
Oh! Wait! I sang the song first!

06:48.110 --> 06:51.750
Uh, he's a frozen treat...
all new taste... interstellar war...

06:51.960 --> 06:52.980
and now available at Gergins.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.970
Aw! It was funnier last time!

06:59.900 --> 07:01.880
Maybe I'm not a real crystal gem.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.790
Don't be silly, Steven.
Of course you are.

07:06.180 --> 07:09.380
And you're fun to have around,
even if your gem IS useless.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.470
I mean... you're one of us, Steven.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.480
We're not the crystal
gems without you.

07:18.340 --> 07:23.070
Yeah. Even if I don't have powers,
I've still got... cookie cat!

07:24.470 --> 07:25.660
So good!

07:34.730 --> 07:37.370
Steven, it's a shield!

07:38.330 --> 07:43.200
Oh! What?! I get a shield?! Oh, yeah!

07:50.400 --> 07:55.640
Oh! Cookie cat! I summon
my weapon by eating ice cream!

07:55.790 --> 07:57.600
What's in these things?

08:03.860 --> 08:04.500
What was that?

08:08.700 --> 08:09.710
It's the mother.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.650
Stay in the house, Steven.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.150
No way! I'm coming too!

08:48.010 --> 08:50.720
We could really use Steven's
shield right about now.

08:52.180 --> 08:52.680
Hey!

08:57.290 --> 08:58.530
Leave them alone!

08:58.890 --> 09:00.800
Steven! No!

09:01.020 --> 09:06.140
Cookie cat crystal-combo
powers, activate!

09:20.150 --> 09:22.120
We need to save Steven!

09:23.290 --> 09:25.630
Can we save ourselves first?

09:26.420 --> 09:27.780
Goodbye, my friends.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.680
Why isn't it working?!

09:38.850 --> 09:39.440
Steven!

09:47.400 --> 09:50.970
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

09:53.360 --> 09:59.850
Cookie cat, he's a pet for your tummy.
Cookie cat, he's superduper yummy!

10:00.260 --> 10:06.130
Cookie cat! He left his family behind!
Cookie c-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-t!

10:08.190 --> 10:10.590
Now available... nowhere.

10:11.790 --> 10:12.560
Yes!

10:12.650 --> 10:14.120
Gems. Weapons.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.640
Let's do it.

10:36.340 --> 10:41.080
Farewell, sweet cookie cats. I'll always
remember the time we spent together.

10:42.370 --> 10:43.970
Shh. Hush now.

10:44.590 --> 10:45.750
Are you crying?

10:45.830 --> 10:46.930
Only a little!

10:46.980 --> 10:49.600
Well, I guess your powers
don't come from ice cream.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.210
Of course they don't
come from ice cream!

10:52.870 --> 10:53.960
Don't worry, Steven.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.970
I'm sure someday you'll figure
out how to activate your gem.

10:57.170 --> 11:00.430
Yes. In your own Steveny way.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.830
I'm okay, guys! I just...

11:04.500 --> 11:06.540
I-I think I ate too many cookie cats.
