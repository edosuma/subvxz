00:08.042 --> 00:10.042
Ah!

00:10.044 --> 00:11.343
(gasps)

00:12.346 --> 00:14.446
Whoa, buddy!

00:14.448 --> 00:17.883
Hey, are you okay?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.718
I guess that's a cut?

00:23.991 --> 00:25.791
We're filming a scene
from <i> voltage.</i>

00:26.961 --> 00:30.129
Liv's new show, <i> voltage,</i>
is filming at ridgewood.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.065
We're using the location money
to upgrade the computer lab,

00:33.067 --> 00:35.634
And to put doors
on the bathroom stalls.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.637
You must be liv's twin.
I'm josh.

00:38.639 --> 00:42.741
Maddie. I am so sorry that
I ruined one of your scenes.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.477
It's all right. I'll just have
that evil government agent

00:45.479 --> 00:47.813
Throw me into the lockers
again.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.481
(chuckles nervously)

00:49.483 --> 00:51.517
Well, you know what?

00:51.519 --> 00:55.487
Feel free to run onto
the court during a game
and ruin one of my shots.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.656
Well, I just might do that.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.758
Do it, and you'll be
walking funny for a week.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.229
-But you just told me--
-I know what I said.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.936
It's not gonna be tough
telling you and liv apart.

The day you've waited for
has come.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.732
Cowbell week begins...

02:13.734 --> 02:16.902
-Now!
-(cheering)

02:16.904 --> 02:18.403
Boom!

02:18.405 --> 02:22.341
Andie, you just
got cowbelled!

02:22.343 --> 02:23.909
Now moo
like you mean it.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.011
(laughs) moo!

02:26.013 --> 02:27.646
Yeah! Aw!

02:27.648 --> 02:31.450
There is one week
out of the entire year
where there are no sports,

02:31.452 --> 02:35.454
So our sports-crazed school
created cowbell week.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.757
You're out when somebody
hangs a cowbell
around your neck.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.793
I have been eliminated
super early every year.

02:41.795 --> 02:45.464
But this year, I think I'm--
dang it!

02:45.466 --> 02:47.332
Moo it out, munch.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.935
Moo.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.775
Yes!

02:56.777 --> 03:00.112
Oh, my first bell
of the year.

03:00.114 --> 03:04.249
I am the milkmaid.
Hear me pour.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.222
Hey, you may have been champ
for the last two years,

03:10.224 --> 03:11.957
But I'm here now.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.126
There's no way
you get the three-peat.

03:14.128 --> 03:18.363
Maddie: Aw, well good luck
my little calf,

03:18.365 --> 03:20.599
Because maddie
moos for no one.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.238
No! But this was
my chance to--

03:26.240 --> 03:29.374
Not my intention, gumball,
but it's time to moo.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.546
Moo.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.814
Aw.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.852
Wow, you are fast,
dump truck.

03:40.854 --> 03:44.723
But not fast enough
to 'bell the milkmaid.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.560
You're a worthy opponent,
and I'll be sad
when I take you down.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.396
(laughs sarcastically)
please.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.434
You are just a speed bump
on my way to a three-peat.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.768
It is on.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.247
So this is my secret lair.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.450
It's an old clock tower

04:11.452 --> 04:14.286
Where tess can
build her gadgets,
practice her powers,

04:14.288 --> 04:16.321
And deliver
angst-ridden speeches.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.891
Wow, this is so cool, liv.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.693
Thanks for giving us
a set tour.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.763
Yeah. Plus maddie
can't cowbell me here.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.866
Okay, that's what I thought
when I was in
the bathroom earlier.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.435
She cowbelled me
while I was...

04:31.805 --> 04:34.139
Let's just say that
I assumed I was safe.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.878
-Can we go up to the roof
where you get your
secret powers?

04:39.880 --> 04:40.946
(gasps)

04:42.983 --> 04:47.052
In reality, that's where
I keep my secret lip gloss,
but go for it.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.555
Hey, liv. See you tomorrow.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.457
Oh, josh, wait.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.159
What are you doing
with the rest of your day?

04:54.161 --> 04:56.828
Well, I'm not sure
what to do around here.

04:56.830 --> 05:01.566
If I was still in l.A.,
me and my friends would
probably hit a box-lates class.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.969
It's a combination of
boxing and pilates.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.139
Ooh. The workout that
strengthens your core
and your uppercut.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.740
Yep.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.076
But instead I'll probably
go to my hotel and read.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.780
I just got a book called
<i>things to do in wisconsin</i>
<i>when you don't have any friends.</i>

05:14.782 --> 05:16.248
Both: (chuckle)

05:16.250 --> 05:19.251
I was so hyped to shoot
<i>voltage </i> in stevens point

05:19.253 --> 05:20.752
And stay close to
my friends and family.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.621
But it didn't really
occur to me

05:22.623 --> 05:25.223
That I would be taking
other people away
from their friends and family

05:26.126 --> 05:27.559
And trendy workout classes.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.029
Engine room,
I need more power.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.832
(in scottish accent)
I'm givin' you all I got,
captain!

05:35.035 --> 05:36.568
Guys!

05:38.372 --> 05:40.439
I need to talk to you
about something.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.508
Is this the speech about
not embarrassing you
at your work?

05:45.279 --> 05:47.546
No. I have very much
given up on that one.

05:47.548 --> 05:51.016
Anyway, um,
my co-star, josh

05:51.018 --> 05:52.951
Is just having
a little trouble fitting in,

05:52.953 --> 05:55.354
And I was just, you know,
hoping that you could

05:55.356 --> 05:57.289
Help me make him
feel welcome in stevens point.

05:57.291 --> 06:00.125
Yeah, sure. Uh,
what's he like to do?

06:00.127 --> 06:03.795
He says he's
really into box-lates,

06:03.797 --> 06:05.964
Which is like pilates
but with boxing.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.899
-Both: (chuckles)
-oh, sweet.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.468
Well, I could
build us a boxing ring.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.139
My uncle's barn
just fell down.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.973
Not sure how you got
boxing ring from barn,
but yeah, have at it.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.311
One more thing.
No cowbell.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.313
Just because josh is
new to wisconsin,

06:21.315 --> 06:23.548
And he's not ready for
the deep end of the cheese pool.

06:23.550 --> 06:27.152
But cowbell week is who we are,
it's what we do.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.121
It's why we moo.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.656
I'll let you play spaceship
a little longer.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.891
Both: Deal!

06:37.998 --> 06:39.664
Yo, parker,
I need your attention.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.167
Yeah, and I need
a cooler older brother.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.037
Funny you should say that,
because our needs are related.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.140
Sadly, so are we.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.042
What's up?

06:51.044 --> 06:55.347
Today, I bid farewell
to my cat shirt collection.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.519
Your cat shirts?
But that's your thing.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.254
Kids even call you
"cat shirt guy."

07:02.256 --> 07:06.625
Exactly. And I thought that
it was just a clever
and flattering nickname,

07:06.627 --> 07:09.194
But then today in gym,
when we were picking teams

07:09.196 --> 07:12.731
Dump truck was all,
"hey, yo. Hey,
hey, oh.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.033
"I'll take
cat shirt guy, hey."

07:15.035 --> 07:18.437
He thinks that cat shirt guy
is my name.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.572
As did everyone else in gym.

07:20.574 --> 07:24.643
And so I asked around school,
and that's what
everyone calls me now.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.778
Ugh, even in rocketry club.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.982
No, that's not right.
They should call you
"geeky rocket guy."

07:30.984 --> 07:33.084
I know, right?

07:33.086 --> 07:37.422
I am trapped in an
adorable prison
of my own making.

07:37.424 --> 07:42.294
Okay, so what's the plan,
"getting worked up
over something stupid guy?"

07:44.465 --> 07:45.964
It's time to
change my image.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.434
Cat shirt guy is dead.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.669
Seriously?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.937
Oh yeah.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.072
So can you, like,
donate these to charity?

07:54.074 --> 07:56.107
Are you sure you want to
get rid of all of these?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.977
Even "cat riding a hot dog?"

08:00.013 --> 08:01.646
"space cat?"

08:02.683 --> 08:04.983
"space cat two:
The legend continues?"

08:06.420 --> 08:08.286
Please don't mention them
by name, parker.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.555
It makes it that much harder
than it already is.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.325
'cause they're my kitties. Oh!

08:19.132 --> 08:20.599
What do you think, josh?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.501
Wow, this is cool.

08:22.503 --> 08:26.838
Thank you. We built you
a box-lates ring,
wisconsin style.

08:28.442 --> 08:30.342
And by "we," I mean
andie did everything.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.846
We even got you
a sparing partner.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.219
Did someone order
a pugilist?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.589
It's a fancy word for "boxer."
look it up.

08:47.961 --> 08:51.463
Let me hook you up.
Can I touch the jacket?

08:51.465 --> 08:52.864
I'll allow it.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.836
Hey, where'd you
get this contraption?

08:57.838 --> 09:01.306
I built it out of
some old farm equipment.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.643
Oh, excellent spot welding.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.311
That's an alluring quality.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.281
(giggles) whatever.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.054
(quietly) stop.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.989
Thanks for going
out of your way for me, liv.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.325
Oh yeah. Of course,

09:20.327 --> 09:23.461
And this is so much better
than sitting alone
in your hotel room, right?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.371
Wow.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.340
You're quite the prancer.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.276
My instructor said that
footwork is 60 percent
of the workout.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.445
I'm advanced.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.183
Girls: Oh!

09:48.689 --> 09:52.123
What are you doing?
You were just supposed to
work him out.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.425
Oh...

09:54.628 --> 09:56.928
See, I thought you wanted me
to work him over.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.099
Yeah, my bad. That's on me.
My bad.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.773
Yo, parkito.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.445
Check out my
post-cat shirt guy threads.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.049
Well, if you're good
without your cat shirts,

10:18.051 --> 10:20.518
How about we get rid of
all your other cat stuff.

10:22.656 --> 10:27.125
Kitty robes,
your kitty pajamas,
both footie and not.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.495
And your
kitty undergarments.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.734
You know, I'm not sure that
I have underwear that
doesn't have cats on it.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.302
You do not.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.772
And I'll need your socks.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.741
Whoa, whoa, bro.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.577
My calicos, bro?

10:47.748 --> 10:50.315
They were my first pair.
They got me through
middle school.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.685
Now it's time for
big boy socks.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.489
Calicos gotta go, bro.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.457
I knew he wouldn't do it.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.426
Those socks put him
on the kitty path

11:01.428 --> 11:04.696
Like a ball of yarn
he couldn't help but follow.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.098
(sigh)

11:07.100 --> 11:12.637
After 1,020 wearings,
my toes are finally free.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.774
I couldn't believe
he gave them up.

11:15.776 --> 11:19.477
The world had broken him,
but it had not broken me.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.714
Joseph gilligan rooney,
you will wear cats again.

11:26.953 --> 11:30.689
Garrison, that ufo that you saw
when the lightning hit me,

11:31.725 --> 11:32.857
I found it...

11:34.127 --> 11:36.361
Or what was left of it.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.531
Open the cabinet.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.107
Well, now there's no doubt.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.377
Your powers
are not from this world.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.646
We finally have an answer.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.214
Do we?

12:00.053 --> 12:03.388
Where are you from...
Garrison?

12:04.357 --> 12:06.591
Why are you asking me this?

12:06.592 --> 12:08.826
Because I also found a
missing persons report
from roswell, new mexico.

12:08.829 --> 12:13.298
It was from 25 years ago.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.235
Liv: Were you gonna try
and tell me that this isn't you?

12:20.373 --> 12:21.773
It used to be.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.846
There's something about me...

12:27.848 --> 12:29.080
You don't know.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.190
Wow, it's so cool
when it's all put together.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.926
-I can't wait to find out
what happens next.
-(chuckles)

12:42.929 --> 12:45.096
Wait, you know
what happens next.
(chuckles)

12:46.032 --> 12:48.133
They gave us the script
last night.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.368
Kind of tough to read when
you're stuck in the
fetal position

12:50.370 --> 12:51.870
From getting
punched in the stomach.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.705
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles)

12:53.707 --> 12:56.608
Yeah, I'm really sorry
about that.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.544
Your friend, bulldozer,
has a solid left.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.846
His name is dump truck.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.049
Please don't tell him
I got his name wrong.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.887
Um, yeah. Listen,

13:08.889 --> 13:12.457
Yesterday did not exactly
go as planned.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.994
Um, I was just trying to bring
a little los angeles to
stevens point for you.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.731
That's really sweet,
but I already know la.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.600
I'm trying to
get to know stevens point.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.403
Is there anything
super stevens pointy
going on right now?

13:25.405 --> 13:28.907
I guess I didn't really think
that you would be into that.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.009
Are you kidding?
I'm up for anything.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.877
Oh, well in that case...

13:34.414 --> 13:36.848
I hope you brought your
swimming goggles, because we...

13:36.850 --> 13:40.151
Are about to jump into the
deep end of the cheese pool.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.362
So, we call this
cowbell week.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.898
I call this awesome.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.702
Mackenzie, I love your dress!

13:57.704 --> 14:00.738
(gasps) I have a necklace
that matches!

14:02.876 --> 14:05.176
Okay, so basically,

14:05.178 --> 14:08.646
Anything goes as long as
no one puts a cowbell
around your neck,

14:08.648 --> 14:10.682
And then the last two people
standing without cowbells

14:10.684 --> 14:12.350
Face off tonight at
the night of the cowbell.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.553
-Let's do this.
-(gasps)

14:46.086 --> 14:47.252
Hey.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.222
Save us both some time, kid.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.235
(gasps)

15:10.777 --> 15:12.010
(gasps)

15:13.847 --> 15:15.246
Aw, moo.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.384
That bell was mine, truck.

15:19.386 --> 15:24.255
Too bad, so sad
and other childhood taunts.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.693
Okay, so it's just down to
you and maddie and dump truck,

15:28.695 --> 15:30.428
And if one of them
gets eliminated,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.863
You go to
the night of the cowbell,

15:31.865 --> 15:34.465
And you're gonna become
a stevens point legend.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.134
Not happening, prancer.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.807
Whoa, hey, yo.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.376
You blocked my cowbell
with your doohickey.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.913
You built a nice
cowbell blocker, andie.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.549
This doohickey
is your handiwork?

15:51.551 --> 15:52.784
Respect.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.154
Hey, are you a scorpio?

15:56.156 --> 15:58.389
(giggles) whatever.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.961
I'm sorry.
Cow-y says what?

16:06.900 --> 16:07.966
Moo.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.277
We have the
final two contestants

16:19.279 --> 16:21.646
For the night of the cowbell.

16:21.648 --> 16:27.352
Maddie "mad dog" rooney versus
josh "the new guy" wilcox!

16:30.256 --> 16:32.824
Oh, josh, this is
so exciting!

16:32.826 --> 16:35.293
You're going to the finals,
and you're gonna win.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.095
Not if I can help it.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.601
Your boy's going down.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.341
Joseph.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.777
I need a word with you
out back.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.279
Yeah, sure thing.
I need your opinion, though.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.483
Right side down
or left side dow--

16:58.485 --> 17:00.451
Nah, man both sides d--
(choking)

17:03.456 --> 17:04.889
(sigh)

17:04.891 --> 17:07.859
He does not make it easy
to help him.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.497
Oh.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.732
What are you doing
with the fellas?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.470
That's-- I thought you were
giving them away.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.639
Yeah, I couldn't get
anyone to take them.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.244
And besides, you need
a little more closure
than that.

17:26.246 --> 17:30.214
So I invented
dr. P's kitty crusher.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.200
Your turn.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.035
Munch away, munch.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.503
Sure.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.573
Just some
dumb cat clothes.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.777
All right,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.512
Then push that button!

18:01.514 --> 18:03.848
Eeh! I ca--

18:03.850 --> 18:05.083
Come on.
Crush some kitties.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.352
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.421
I love my kitties way to much
to crush them.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.591
Joey, face it.
You're cat shirt guy.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.926
There's no shame in that.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.062
Okay, maybe a little shame,

18:18.064 --> 18:22.100
But you gotta accept
who you are and live
your best kitty cat life.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.769
You're right, bro. I do.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.270
Thank you.

18:26.272 --> 18:30.475
Did you really have to destroy
such a stellar outfit?

18:30.477 --> 18:33.111
I didn't have to.
I wanted to.

18:36.216 --> 18:41.052
Welcome to
night of the cowbell.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.453
(cheering)

18:44.390 --> 18:45.656
You see how fun
and cool this is?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.992
It is way better

18:47.993 --> 18:50.327
Than hanging out behind
the mini-mart eating nachos
with the riff-raff. Am I right?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.897
That's another big thing
that we do.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.299
You came on
a really big week.
(chuckles)

18:55.301 --> 18:56.834
Time for round one.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.536
First cowbeller to
miss the cow head...

18:59.973 --> 19:02.006
Is the loser.

19:02.008 --> 19:05.042
Watch and learn, new guy.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.682
-Willow: Yeah!
-Maddie: Whoa!

19:11.684 --> 19:13.351
You just got milked!

19:14.587 --> 19:18.156
Well, I brought you something
to dunk in that milk.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.994
(cheering)

19:24.097 --> 19:25.763
Whoa, I did it!

19:25.765 --> 19:28.599
And I thought I topped out
with my awesome smack talk.

19:28.601 --> 19:33.604
That's the end of round one.
Raise that cow head!

19:33.606 --> 19:35.873
(cheering)

19:41.514 --> 19:43.281
Andie bustamante,

19:43.283 --> 19:45.216
I was wondering if
you would do me the honor

19:45.218 --> 19:48.352
Of accompanying me to the
race track one evening
in the near future.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.689
Aw, dump!

19:51.691 --> 19:54.592
A catalytic converter
for a big block v-eight?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.061
How did you know?

19:57.063 --> 19:59.497
Are you the type of girl
who plugs in a car?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.265
I don't think so.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.401
I'll be in touch.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.472
Guess what?

20:08.474 --> 20:09.974
Dump truck
just asked me out.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.210
-(sympathetically) aww.
-She's excited.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.811
(excited) aww!

20:13.813 --> 20:15.846
-Yay!
-(cowbell clanging)

20:15.848 --> 20:18.649
Round two!

20:18.651 --> 20:21.986
(cheering)

20:21.988 --> 20:24.422
Time to add a little sizzle
to this steak.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.892
Ssss.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.765
(cheering)

20:34.767 --> 20:36.901
Oh! Bam! What?

20:39.005 --> 20:41.606
I don't know what that means,
but it has me rattled.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.842
No, no, no. Josh,
it's totally fine.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.677
Stevens point is behind you,
right guys?

20:46.679 --> 20:49.280
All: (chanting)
josh, josh, josh.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.619
This is for you,
stevens point.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.032
Whoa!

21:09.569 --> 21:11.302
All: Oh!

21:12.605 --> 21:16.107
Josh! Hey, are you okay?

21:16.109 --> 21:17.375
Yeah.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.878
I've gotten pretty good at
crashing into these lockers.

21:23.216 --> 21:24.915
Yeah...

21:24.917 --> 21:29.553
Not as good as I've gotten
at being cowbell week champion!

21:29.555 --> 21:31.789
(cheering)

21:34.727 --> 21:36.594
Sorry I had to take you down,
josh, but I mean...

21:36.596 --> 21:38.496
It's cowbell week.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.765
Yeah, it's true.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.900
I don't wear flats,
and she doesn't lose.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.137
I'm just glad
I got to play.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.406
Aw, well that...

21:48.408 --> 21:50.007
Sounds like loser talk.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.512
Which actually reminds me,
I have some losers to go taunt,

21:54.514 --> 21:56.247
So... (tongue tick)

21:58.484 --> 22:01.285
Thanks for getting me
out of my hotel room.

22:01.287 --> 22:04.121
Yeah, no problem.
I'm just really happy
you're making friends.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.356
Yeah.

22:05.358 --> 22:10.528
So... Maddie.
Is she dating anyone?

22:10.530 --> 22:12.263
No, why?

22:12.265 --> 22:14.332
(gasps)

22:15.468 --> 22:17.668
You like maddie!

22:19.172 --> 22:20.604
How could you not?

22:20.606 --> 22:22.273
She's adorable.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.508
I belled you!
I belled you!

22:24.510 --> 22:26.777
And you wish I belled you!

22:26.779 --> 22:28.913
And I belled you
in your sleep!

22:30.883 --> 22:33.451
Yes, yeah, adorable.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.219
That is what
came to my mind too.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.469
Uh, hey willow.

22:55.308 --> 22:58.542
I was hoping if I didn't move,
you wouldn't notice me.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.978
No, I noticed.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.648
It's not what it looks like,
I swear.

23:04.650 --> 23:07.918
Really? Because it looks like
you're stealing joey's clothes

23:07.920 --> 23:09.587
Because you're
obsessed with him.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.355
Oh, okay.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.057
It's exactly
what it looks like.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.527
How about
I give you five bucks

23:16.529 --> 23:18.162
To pretend
this never happened.

23:18.164 --> 23:22.566
Mmm, looking is five,
touching is ten.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.834
Fine.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.569
Here's 20. I did some
other stuff. Don't ask.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.072
Haaah!

23:31.444 --> 23:32.743
Maddie:
<i>You just got milked!</i>
