02:43.831 --> 02:46.667
Alright, let's dig into this sucker.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.768
There you go.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.245
- Wow.
- Aw, nice!

02:57.278 --> 03:00.381
Oh my gosh, I've gotta get this.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.015
Alright, see cheese!

03:05.253 --> 03:07.688
That's great.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.056
Let me see your hands, girly.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.190
Okay I think we're gonna skip
the napkins and go straight

03:11.191 --> 03:12.526
for the big guns, towel anybody?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.161
I've got this one.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.496
Come on, towel boy.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.598
Come on, watch out.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.866
Let me see these hands.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.000
Nice.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.870
- Well done.
- There you go.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.705
- Thank you.
- Come on.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.642
Say it's your birthday.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.980
I'll washed my hands, I promise.

03:43.257 --> 03:47.628
She's growing up fast, buddy.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.963
How you feel about tonight?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.866
No, I'm out.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.734
This shit is hitting the fan
around here, I can't do it.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.771
Look, we do tonight and
then we take a break...

03:57.805 --> 03:59.139
- No.
- But it's gotta be tonight.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.092
You find somebody else.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.377
I got Cy coming in for backup.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.945
Backup.

04:04.978 --> 04:05.779
Really?

04:06.947 --> 04:07.981
Seriously?

04:11.685 --> 04:12.486
Janelle.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.224
Thank you, Father.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.659
That's my bad.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.441
And then Alice ran off and she thought

04:33.474 --> 04:36.777
what a great dream it had been.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.811
The end.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.112
One more?

04:39.146 --> 04:40.981
No, baby girl, it's time to go to sleep.

04:41.014 --> 04:41.915
Please?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.284
Read the monster book.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.953
The monster book.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.188
I thought you were afraid of monsters.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.624
- But he's a good monster.
- He is?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.593
I'm not scared of him anymore.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.394
Okay.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.201
Alright, time to go to sleep, okay?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.870
Tomorrow we'll get a new book

05:02.903 --> 05:04.438
and we'll start a whole new story.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.873
Okay.

05:05.906 --> 05:06.707
Okay.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.279
Peek-a-boo.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.180
Caroline.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.550
I see you.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.019
Peek-a-boo.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.355
I see you.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.057
Goodnight.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.493
Goodnight, baby.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.594
Sweet dreams.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.918
I was gonna tell you.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.525
When do we come first?

05:57.558 --> 05:58.859
Hm?

05:58.892 --> 06:00.227
Come on.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.996
You know you always come first.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.232
But Janelle, I cannot talk
about the same shit with you

06:05.265 --> 06:07.200
over and over, it's driving me crazy.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.169
But it's getting worse, not better.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.338
You don't sleep, you barely eat.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.372
I'm tired.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.342
It takes effort, okay?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.111
Why can't you understand that?

06:18.145 --> 06:22.382
Sometimes I look in your
eyes and I don't see you.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.320
What if it happens again?

06:30.991 --> 06:34.394
Come on, you're so
close to having a life.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.465
A real, normal life.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.070
I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.304
Ever.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.138
Ever.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.142
What if you're wrong?

06:50.678 --> 06:52.079
I'm not.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.747
- Think about Caroline.
- I am.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.014
That little girl needs her daddy.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.249
Enough!

06:56.283 --> 06:57.317
Enough!

06:57.350 --> 06:58.686
Enough, enough!

06:59.687 --> 07:02.055
Enough, enough, enough!

07:06.259 --> 07:07.327
Fucking cunt.

07:26.714 --> 07:27.515
Damon!

07:43.664 --> 07:45.032
Janelle.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.667
Stay away from me!

07:49.837 --> 07:50.638
Janelle.

07:56.043 --> 07:56.844
It's me.

07:58.045 --> 07:58.912
It's Damon.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.381
Fuck you.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.188
You stay on the couch.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.999
Fuck.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.625
What are you doing?

10:20.520 --> 10:24.157
What do you want me to do, Janelle?

10:24.191 --> 10:25.292
Another exorcism.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.526
Oh, come on.

10:27.861 --> 10:31.264
You know that shit doesn't work for me.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.299
Not Padre.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.969
We go to Rome.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.275
You want me to turn
myself into the church?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.076
Come on.

10:46.579 --> 10:50.483
I can't believe you want me to
turn myself into the church.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.053
You know I wouldn't do that to you.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.087
Then what?

10:55.422 --> 10:58.726
We find somebody there who can help us.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.163
Padre is good but we
need somebody better.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.403
Okay.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.504
Yeah?

11:13.106 --> 11:16.243
But I can't out it tonight.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.878
I gave them my word.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.416
Tomorrow.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.854
Tomorrow, hey.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.355
We'll go somewhere.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.457
Anywhere.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.459
All of us.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.028
Your call.

11:38.966 --> 11:39.767
Promise?

11:41.869 --> 11:42.870
I promise.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.143
Okay.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.312
Okay.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.375
Does Dale even know we're coming?

12:22.409 --> 12:25.578
It's Dale, I'm not sure what he knows.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.651
We got company.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.303
You're late.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.971
02:00 mean something
different in the Corps,

12:51.972 --> 12:53.773
or you Dryers just can't tell the time?

12:53.807 --> 12:56.443
Bring any girl scout cookies
with you today, sweetheart?

12:56.476 --> 13:00.013
Oh yeah, Damon, I got your
girl scout cookies right here.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.082
Cream-filled with a bunch of fuck you.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.116
Delicious.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.487
Easy, tiger.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.789
Come on, no guns, alright?

13:09.823 --> 13:12.525
We're trying to save
a man, not kill him.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.526
Okay, great.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.796
Well I brought a pink one just for you.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.265
- Wow.
- I like her.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.168
Yeah.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.325
Are you kidding me?

13:45.358 --> 13:46.559
I'm gonna keep offering.

13:46.593 --> 13:47.895
I'm gonna keep saying no.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.496
Cy?

13:49.529 --> 13:50.998
Oh, I got my own.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.301
Jesus is my homeboy.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.102
Nice.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.338
Let's roll.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.555
So Dale's a bit slow, kinda skittish.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.491
I'm not sure he truly
understands what I told him.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.227
Whatever's inside of him,

14:20.260 --> 14:22.996
it's stronger than what
we dealt with last time.

14:23.030 --> 14:26.633
So are you doing it your way or his way?

14:27.567 --> 14:28.735
Always my way.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.572
I wanna see his way.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.907
No you don't.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.615
Hello, Dale.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.620
Kinda late to be chopping wood, huh?

14:50.157 --> 14:51.158
It's dark.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.594
Dark is my favorite time now.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.699
Dale, do you remember
what we talked about

14:59.732 --> 15:01.068
last time I was here?

15:01.101 --> 15:05.305
That's why we're here, Dale,
are you ready for that?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.676
I must make tea.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.545
Who wants tea?

15:12.579 --> 15:13.646
Hey, buddy.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.450
Put down the machete, okay?

15:18.618 --> 15:20.720
I think we got enough wood for tonight.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.922
There are guests.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.357
I must make tea.

15:27.794 --> 15:28.595
Dale!

15:32.966 --> 15:34.101
I know you.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.004
We all know you.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.541
Dale.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.277
It's me.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.784
It's Damon.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.289
Let us help you.

15:58.992 --> 15:59.792
No.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.728
No!

16:09.902 --> 16:10.703
Dale.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.041
This can go one of two ways.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.147
I can kill you!

17:15.435 --> 17:17.704
In the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, I command you

17:17.737 --> 17:19.705
to release this man, demon!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.742
Release this man! You
have no power here!

17:23.776 --> 17:27.046
In the name of our
father, I command you!

17:28.781 --> 17:32.152
You always were a self-righteous
bag of shit, Reverend!

17:33.153 --> 17:34.687
You have no power!

17:34.721 --> 17:36.456
Jesus Christ has the power,

17:36.489 --> 17:39.959
and I command you to
release this man, demon!

17:39.992 --> 17:41.228
Release him!

18:19.832 --> 18:22.802
You guys want some tea?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.704
Can I get you anything?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.946
You know, I've seen some shit,

18:33.980 --> 18:37.784
but I have never seen shit like that.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.621
Every possession's unique,
just like every demon.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.790
That black cloud, it...

18:45.192 --> 18:46.959
I mean, what the fuck?

18:46.993 --> 18:50.497
It's the work of a major
demon, probably has a name.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.199
They don't fuck around.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.433
Dale's demon?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.636
No, that's a lesser demon.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.173
Aroused, manipulated by a greater one.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.608
A greater one?

19:03.543 --> 19:07.046
You guys are really starting
to scare the hell outta me.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.817
I'm not sure I've got
what it takes for this.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.987
What it takes is faith.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.323
Unyielding faith.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.127
At least for most of us.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.298
Look, Padre is gonna
need your help for a while.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.903
What, are you going somewhere?

19:34.907 --> 19:38.845
So you really got a demon
in you, like, for real?

19:50.056 --> 19:51.224
How'd it happen?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.895
We were in Afghanistan.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.030
It was his 18th birthday.

19:59.299 --> 20:03.102
We were going cave to cave
doing short recon work.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.973
Looking for, I don't know what.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.410
And so you exorcized him?

20:10.443 --> 20:12.211
No.

20:12.245 --> 20:15.282
What the hell did I know about demons?

20:15.315 --> 20:17.617
We found some cleric, some,

20:19.319 --> 20:21.854
some guy, he knew a little
bit about possession but,

20:21.888 --> 20:24.391
just enough to fuck it up.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.225
Now he's a half-breed.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.930
You said Dale was
aroused by a major demon.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.965
Who is this major demon?

20:35.402 --> 20:37.937
He will not speak it.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.239
What is "the incident?"

20:40.273 --> 20:43.109
It's, it's not for me to tell.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.179
But whatever you think it was,

20:48.748 --> 20:49.616
it's worse.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.458
- Fuck.
- Go.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.761
- Do not come in here!
- Damon!

21:01.794 --> 21:03.396
- I saw it!
- That is not Janelle!

21:03.430 --> 21:05.398
- Do not listen to her!
- Easy!

21:06.699 --> 21:07.900
Look at me, Janelle, look at me.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.269
Do not look at her!

21:10.303 --> 21:12.339
- Janelle, look at me.
- That's not Janelle!

21:14.106 --> 21:16.576
- That is not Janelle!
- Janelle?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.345
- Open your eyes!
- Give me the knife.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.679
Easy, easy, easy.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.582
Let the knife go.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.483
Easy, easy.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.953
Janelle, with me.

21:26.986 --> 21:27.886
What the fuck is going on here?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.489
Back off, Damon!

21:29.522 --> 21:30.690
- Leave her alone!
- Cy!

21:30.723 --> 21:32.024
Put the fucking gun down!

21:36.062 --> 21:37.430
Put the gun down!

21:37.464 --> 21:38.865
You leave her alone!

22:08.495 --> 22:09.696
Janelle!

22:09.729 --> 22:10.797
Janelle!

22:10.830 --> 22:12.999
Where is Caroline?

22:28.848 --> 22:29.882
Janelle.

22:29.916 --> 22:30.717
Janelle.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.920
I know you can hear me,
you need to be strong.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.689
You can fight this.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.590
Mommy?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.560
Caroline, go back to your room.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.194
Go back to your room!

22:42.228 --> 22:45.898
You fucking cunt, right
here, right fucking here!

22:46.866 --> 22:48.835
Stay away from her!

22:48.868 --> 22:50.036
To me!

22:52.805 --> 22:54.173
Oh, yes.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.676
I can feel you in there.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.112
Yes.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.382
Yamura.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.351
Fucking leave Caroline alone.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.088
Yamura!

23:09.121 --> 23:11.791
Yamura!

23:18.264 --> 23:19.065
Yamura.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.872
Janelle, Janelle.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.273
I love only you.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.654
Come on, now!

23:41.688 --> 23:42.955
No, fucking no!

23:46.258 --> 23:48.360
What the fuck are you doing?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.233
It's okay, it's okay.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.936
It's okay, it's okay, it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.272
It's okay, it's okay,
Janelle, it's okay.

24:00.306 --> 24:03.476
Janelle please okay,
Janelle please okay.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.176
You're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be okay,

24:05.177 --> 24:07.680
you're gonna be okay.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.316
Oh no no no, please no no no no.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.986
Please no, please no.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.623
Come on.

24:17.824 --> 24:21.060
Come on, please no,
please no, please no.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.672
You look lost, bro!

26:47.273 --> 26:50.476
I was gonna tell you the same thing.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.145
What do you want?

26:54.180 --> 26:56.482
I was hoping we could talk.

26:58.885 --> 27:01.220
Got nothing to say to you.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.358
It's about Caroline.

27:10.496 --> 27:11.798
She's turning 18.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.174
After all these years,
you come here to tell me

27:23.175 --> 27:25.311
something I already know?

27:26.412 --> 27:28.715
If you already know, then,

27:28.748 --> 27:31.550
it shouldn't come as
a surprise to see me.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.452
Don't mean anything.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.821
It did on your 18th.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.155
She's not me.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.658
Are you sure about that?

27:41.060 --> 27:42.494
You know I can't know where she is,

27:42.528 --> 27:44.496
so why are you doing this?

27:51.037 --> 27:53.172
Get the fuck outta here.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.041
I saw her recently.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.175
Spoke to her.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.047
When?

28:02.081 --> 28:03.549
A few days ago.

28:03.582 --> 28:06.518
Her foster father Will
reached out to me.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.353
And?

28:08.955 --> 28:13.192
I didn't see any definitive
signs, but I got a feeling.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.430
Oh, you got a feeling.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.770
I've been doing this a lot, too, Damon.

28:23.803 --> 28:24.603
So yeah.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.406
I got a feeling.

28:30.142 --> 28:30.943
That it?

28:33.479 --> 28:36.348
Will says she's become
increasingly distant.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.584
Emotional, erratic, angry.

28:40.586 --> 28:41.954
At times, violent.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.429
Here's to being a teenage girl, brah.

28:56.836 --> 29:00.139
This is a boy that Caroline's seeing.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.442
We found him a couple
weeks ago in the woods.

29:11.984 --> 29:12.985
Jesus Christ.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.453
Come with me to see her.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.455
- No way.
- She needs you.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.959
I'm the last person she
needs to see right now.

29:19.992 --> 29:23.562
If you're so sure about it,
just take care of it yourself.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.298
I don't think it's that simple.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.373
I believe the demon in her is Yamura.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.281
It's impossible.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.617
She wasn't exorcized.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.987
We lost the toast.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.158
- It went somewhere that...
- No.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.625
We cast it out.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.293
It would have been too
weak to go anywhere.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.630
You don't know that, you're assuming.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.332
She wasn't exorcized.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.301
No.

30:03.669 --> 30:04.536
She wasn't.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.913
Damon, something's
inside her, I know it.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.415
You're the only one that can help her.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.517
Jesus Christ!

30:19.551 --> 30:21.353
She was a little girl.

30:23.655 --> 30:27.860
Her body was too small to
handle that kind of force.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.496
It said its name.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.199
It had a name.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.871
Are you hearing yourself right now?

30:41.173 --> 30:45.377
There is no way that that bitch
slithered into my daughter.

30:51.583 --> 30:55.421
What if there's a 1%
chance that I'm right?

30:55.454 --> 30:58.690
Is that a risk you're willing to take?

31:41.333 --> 31:44.236
Hm, these must be Will's farmhands.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.246
I don't think I'm getting
the respect that I deserve.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.148
She's not back from school yet.

31:56.182 --> 31:59.285
I told you she's not
back from school yet.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.453
I told you she's not back.

32:04.991 --> 32:08.160
Look, she's answered all
your questions anyway, okay?

32:08.194 --> 32:10.296
It's getting kinda
late in the afternoon.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.662
I think I would wanna see my daughter.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.966
She's answered all your questions all...

32:14.000 --> 32:14.800
Father.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.304
- Not Father anymore.
- Sorry, old habits.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.138
Deputy.

32:21.607 --> 32:22.608
Damon.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.510
Deputy Shane Douglas.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.280
We got a problem?

32:30.149 --> 32:31.617
No problem.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.610
Deputy Doug was just
leaving, weren't you, Deputy?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.887
Deputy Doug will be back.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.460
And I'm gonna keep asking the questions,

32:41.493 --> 32:43.695
and I expect answers.

32:43.729 --> 32:44.530
Gentlemen.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.936
Problems with the local constable?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.838
Nah, no problem.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.840
Thank you for coming.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.809
It's a nice place you got here.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.378
It's quiet.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.746
It used to be.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.053
Did you hear about the boy?

33:07.086 --> 33:10.989
I don't know how much the
father has told you about that.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.624
I know about the boy's death.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.493
Well, Caroline had
nothing to do with that.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.163
Will, you need to
keep an open mind here.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.697
It wasn't her.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.032
It wasn't.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.332
Are you telling me you
don't believe in possession?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.669
Possession?

33:23.702 --> 33:27.706
You're asking me if I believe
in demonic possession?

33:27.739 --> 33:28.740
No, sir.

33:28.774 --> 33:29.841
I do not.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.378
Well, Will.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.749
It's time you started believing.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.757
I'm sorry about that.

33:45.791 --> 33:46.892
No worries.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.868
What the fuck, man?

33:56.902 --> 33:58.670
Would you calm down?

33:58.704 --> 34:00.672
Show some respect.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.209
He doesn't know anything?

34:03.242 --> 34:05.043
You were supposed to
be looking after her.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.777
You got her living here in
this Mexican border town

34:06.778 --> 34:08.880
with this puritan creep,
are you out of your mind?

34:08.914 --> 34:11.016
- I had...
- Deputy Doug?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.118
Jesus Christ!

34:13.652 --> 34:16.955
I had to find somewhere
for her quickly, I've known,

34:16.987 --> 34:19.190
I've known Will a long time.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.692
He's loyal, I trust him,

34:20.726 --> 34:22.761
but all this is not
easy for him to accept.

34:22.793 --> 34:26.331
He doesn't know what he's dealing with.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.369
So now you believe me.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.909
I feel something.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.246
I can feel it.

34:45.617 --> 34:46.818
It's familiar.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.121
But I can't say it's
definitely that cunt of a demon

34:50.156 --> 34:53.159
you think it is but, it's something.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.929
You try me sometimes.

34:57.963 --> 34:58.930
You know that?

35:00.266 --> 35:01.833
You really try me.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.471
It's evil, brother.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.209
It's everywhere.

35:22.854 --> 35:23.955
- Father.
- Thank you.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.524
You're welcome.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.530
Father, Caroline doesn't
remember anything

35:31.563 --> 35:33.799
the night her mother died.

35:35.033 --> 35:39.205
And she doesn't remember
anything before that either,

35:39.238 --> 35:42.241
and I think it's best left that way.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.580
Will, I'm not here to be her father.

35:49.981 --> 35:54.786
I just wanna exorcize this
demon, and then I will leave.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.522
No, I can't, I won't.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.457
I won't let that man touch my daughter.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.991
You need to shut your mouth,

36:00.025 --> 36:02.728
and you need to let me do my job!

36:02.761 --> 36:05.564
Let me tell you something,
you're gonna lay your hands

36:05.597 --> 36:08.267
on my daughter over my dead body.

36:10.001 --> 36:10.769
Will.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.807
Can I speak to you outside for a minute?

36:15.841 --> 36:20.045
You better come at me
with more than that stick.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.749
Just a minute.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.016
You feel me?

36:30.856 --> 36:33.559
You're so fucking stubborn.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.494
I'll deal with Will.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.962
You stayed focused.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.001
Hey, Dad?

37:21.307 --> 37:22.308
Who are you?

37:26.445 --> 37:29.080
I'm a friend of your father.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.521
What's your name, friend?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.160
Gregory.

37:45.030 --> 37:48.634
You know, they think
I'm sick in the head.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.616
You're not.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.256
You've not heard it.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.124
They think I'm evil.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.662
A monster inside me.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.706
What do you know about monsters?

38:36.314 --> 38:38.016
I think I like you.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.195
I'll see you around.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.549
- Hey.
- What's up?

39:14.386 --> 39:16.488
- You look great.
- Thank you.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.490
So those guys at your house,

39:18.524 --> 39:21.660
who do you think they really are?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.995
One guy's a priest or something,

39:24.029 --> 39:27.265
and uh, the other one, I don't know.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.501
Oh, are they here for you?

39:29.535 --> 39:31.036
I guess so.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.971
I've been a bad girl.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.608
What's up with you and Zepata?

39:36.642 --> 39:40.211
Nothing anymore, I'm
kinda with Rivera now.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.112
Why?

39:41.146 --> 39:43.214
Because Rivera said so.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.617
Well, tell him to fuck off.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.453
You're one to talk.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.688
I do what I want with who I want.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.023
I'm just here to have some fun.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.093
So they don't scare
you, even a little bit?

39:55.126 --> 39:57.128
No, not at all.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.296
Hey, I'll handle them.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.699
Okay.

40:00.732 --> 40:01.567
What?

40:01.600 --> 40:02.734
Nothing.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.302
It's fine.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.095
It's okay, just let it
go, don't worry about.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.039
- Did he do anything?
- No, it's fine.

40:08.073 --> 40:12.277
Just leave it alone, just
don't say anything, okay?

40:14.412 --> 40:16.748
♪ Come and get it ♪

40:16.782 --> 40:19.117

man, when I get rich, I'm gonna
have me a mansion right up

40:38.169 --> 40:40.270
there in the hills, you know
what I mean, nice little...

40:40.271 --> 40:41.339
- Hey.
- What's up?

40:41.372 --> 40:44.710
Get me that cute boy
down here, would you?

40:47.145 --> 40:48.580
For you? Yeah.

40:53.151 --> 40:53.952
Hey, you!

40:55.153 --> 40:58.289
Yeah you on the bike, homie, come here!

41:04.229 --> 41:07.298
What you doing on this
side of the tracks, homie?

41:07.332 --> 41:08.534
What, what do you mean?

41:08.567 --> 41:09.800
Yeah this side of the tracks, man.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.269
What you doing over here?

41:11.302 --> 41:13.138
I'm going home, man.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.273
Hey, Caroline.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.843
Hey, we got a party here tonight.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.277
Make sure you show up.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.948
Um, thanks for the invitation but,

41:22.981 --> 41:24.349
I don't know if I can, I can try...

41:24.382 --> 41:27.118
Back the fuck up, man, what
you mean you think you can't?

41:27.152 --> 41:29.220
Don't you know it's her birthday, homie?

41:29.254 --> 41:32.624
You're gonna show up and
you're gonna like it.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.560
Just come, it'll be fun.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.327
I don't even know you guys, so...

41:36.361 --> 41:37.928
That's why you're
going to the party, dog,

41:37.929 --> 41:40.331
'cause you're gonna get to know us.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.700
Like I say, I can try.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.568
I mean, I just gotta go
check with my mom and dad.

41:43.569 --> 41:47.205
Hey, you're being real
rude to my friend here.

41:47.238 --> 41:50.341
Zepata hates rude people, it
brings out the worst in him.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.677
Yeah, I'm not trying
to be rude, I'm just...

41:51.710 --> 41:53.244
Let me tell you something, man.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.945
You know it's about manners,
you know what I mean?

41:54.946 --> 41:56.548
You got a couple manners, huh?

41:56.582 --> 41:57.615
You're gonna go over there
and you're gonna show her

41:57.616 --> 41:59.217
some manners, right?

42:01.119 --> 42:01.987
Hey.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.421
Hey.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.356
Come here.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.059
So I'm Hooper.

42:08.093 --> 42:10.328
I know who you are.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.129
Hooper.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.232
Yeah, you just never speak to me.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.901
So I didn't know.

42:15.934 --> 42:19.270
Well, have you ever spoken to me?

42:19.304 --> 42:21.306
Yeah, I guess I don't.

42:23.809 --> 42:26.011
Well we're talking now.

42:26.044 --> 42:26.945
Yeah, um.

42:27.979 --> 42:29.514
You weren't in school today.

42:29.547 --> 42:33.051
Didn't feel like learning anything new.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.922
Well I heard what happened to Justin.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.556
- Yeah.
- Damn.

42:38.590 --> 42:42.694
I'm sorry, I know you were
dating, that's really messed up.

42:42.728 --> 42:44.295
We were kinda dating.

42:44.329 --> 42:47.365
Yeah, it's really messed up.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.534
Well are you alright?

42:49.567 --> 42:50.568
I'll live.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.739
Do they know what happened to him?

42:53.772 --> 42:55.073
Shit happens.

42:58.243 --> 42:59.811
Why are you hanging out with those guys?

42:59.845 --> 43:02.580
Damn it's like they're in a
fucking gang, they're bad news.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.716
I'm just hanging out, why?

43:04.750 --> 43:07.786
- Okay.
- Are you afraid of me?

43:07.819 --> 43:11.256
- No, I'm not afraid of you.
- Hey, um...

43:13.258 --> 43:16.962
I think you should come
to the party with me.

43:19.998 --> 43:23.769
You mean, you mean with you, with you?

43:23.802 --> 43:25.804
There's a big difference.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.572
Whatever you wanna call it.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.107
So it's a date?

43:30.942 --> 43:32.678
- Great.
- Oh, um.

43:32.711 --> 43:35.814
Just pick me up in a car, not a bike.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.284
I don't have a car yet, so...

43:39.317 --> 43:40.451
11 o'clock?

43:41.653 --> 43:42.754
Yeah, 11, sure.

43:42.788 --> 43:44.022
- Cool.
- Yeah.

43:44.055 --> 43:45.356
Park at the end of the driveway.

43:45.390 --> 43:47.258
Don't come to the house, okay?

43:47.292 --> 43:50.461
- Yeah, no problem, okay.
- I'll see you then.

43:50.495 --> 43:52.497
- See you.
- Bye, Hooper.

43:59.037 --> 44:00.806
I need a car now, great.

44:14.219 --> 44:16.187
Explain to me again,

44:16.221 --> 44:18.824
why we wait until midnight.

44:18.857 --> 44:21.392
She turns 18 at midnight.

44:21.426 --> 44:22.493
Exactly.

44:23.394 --> 44:25.697
She's got something inside of her.

44:25.731 --> 44:27.899
We need to get it out and
we need to get it out now.

44:27.933 --> 44:30.068
What we need is a complete exorcism,

44:30.101 --> 44:32.503
so we need a full possession
and that doesn't happen

44:32.537 --> 44:36.041
with Yamura until
Caroline is fully mature.

44:39.110 --> 44:41.446
That's a bullshit theory.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.983
You're making a mistake.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.684
Well it's what we're doing.

44:46.718 --> 44:47.919
So are you in?

44:49.387 --> 44:50.355
Yes, I'm in.

44:51.589 --> 44:54.025
Is there something you need to tell me?

44:54.059 --> 44:55.060
Like what?

44:56.594 --> 44:59.898
Well, you know how much
I love surprises,

44:59.931 --> 45:02.011
and the last time you dealt
with her, let's just say,

45:02.033 --> 45:05.036
you had a hard time maintaining control.

45:05.070 --> 45:09.074
So again, is there anything
you need to tell me?

45:12.310 --> 45:13.711
Nope.

45:20.585 --> 45:21.386
What?

45:22.420 --> 45:23.454
It's nothing.

45:25.456 --> 45:26.591
What is it?

45:30.061 --> 45:31.763
It's nothing, just
get some sleep, aright?

45:31.797 --> 45:34.432
- You're gonna need it.
- What, are you going out?

45:34.465 --> 45:38.403
Yeah, I'm gonna have a
look around the neighborhood.

45:38.436 --> 45:41.306
- I'm coming with you.
- No, stay here.

45:41.339 --> 45:44.342
Get some rest, you're gonna need it.

46:52.543 --> 46:54.445
Fuck, god-damnit!

46:54.479 --> 46:56.281
You scared the crap outta me.

46:56.314 --> 46:57.315
Nice ride.

46:58.483 --> 46:59.817
Yeah, thanks.

46:59.851 --> 47:01.019
It's not mine, though.

47:01.052 --> 47:03.688
It's your big brother's car, right?

47:03.721 --> 47:05.823
Yeah, how did you know that?

47:05.857 --> 47:07.558
Lucky guess.

47:07.592 --> 47:09.594
Slide over, I'm driving.

47:11.362 --> 47:12.797
What? No.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.133
No, he'll kill me.

47:15.166 --> 47:17.668
He's gonna kill you regardless.

47:17.702 --> 47:19.905
But seriously, slide over.

47:21.539 --> 47:24.542
The keys are in the ignition.

47:24.575 --> 47:28.046
Um, gas is on the right,
brakes are on the left.

47:28.079 --> 47:29.380
You know how to drive?

47:29.414 --> 47:30.780
Yeah, yeah I think I got it from here.

47:30.781 --> 47:33.784
Okay.

48:03.248 --> 48:05.816
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.627
Are you coming or are
you just gonna stand there?

48:16.661 --> 48:17.728
My bad.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.031
Nice car.

48:20.065 --> 48:22.633
Um, it's my car.

48:22.667 --> 48:25.803
Um, I don't think I know
anybody here, actually.

48:25.836 --> 48:27.238
Don't worry about it.

48:27.272 --> 48:28.573
So, I can't believe

48:28.606 --> 48:31.042
you've actually invited me here.

48:31.076 --> 48:32.177
Man, relax.

48:33.444 --> 48:36.314
So why me, why did you invite me here?

48:36.347 --> 48:38.583
I don't know, you seemed like a fun guy

48:38.616 --> 48:40.751
and that's exactly
what I need right now.

48:40.785 --> 48:42.053
Fun.

48:42.087 --> 48:44.755
That means nice and the
nice guy spells doom.

48:44.789 --> 48:46.457
Doom?

48:46.491 --> 48:48.926
Yeah, it's a total
freeze zone precursor.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.928
The nice guys always
finish last, I know.

48:50.962 --> 48:53.764
You know what you should
do, finish that beer,

48:53.798 --> 48:56.501
and just see where the night takes you.

48:56.534 --> 48:58.003
See shit like that, who says that?

48:58.036 --> 49:00.171
- Girl, how are you.
- How are you?

49:00.205 --> 49:03.574
- Good to see you.
- Oh man, I'm glad you came.

49:03.608 --> 49:05.276
Hey what's up, man?

49:07.845 --> 49:10.248
Hey, you showed up.

49:10.281 --> 49:11.983
- Yeah, surprisingly, right?
- He did.

49:12.017 --> 49:14.652
Yeah, you having a good time?

49:14.685 --> 49:16.654
It's alright, yeah I'm having fun.

49:16.687 --> 49:18.622
- It's alright, it's great.
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

49:18.623 --> 49:19.991
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah.

49:20.025 --> 49:21.658
- I'm having a great time.
- When did you get here?

49:21.659 --> 49:23.961
- Um, just recently.
- Oh, same.

49:23.995 --> 49:26.464
- Come on, let's go.
- Just give me a second.

49:26.497 --> 49:28.333
- What?
- Come on, get over here.

49:28.366 --> 49:30.368
- Uh, bye, see ya.
- Bye.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.504
What was that about?

49:33.538 --> 49:35.806
Don't worry about it.

49:35.840 --> 49:40.045
So yeah, I guess, sometimes I
do things, I don't know why.

49:41.879 --> 49:42.680
But, hey.

49:44.249 --> 49:48.686
Tonight, all I wanna do is
have fun, can we do that?

49:48.719 --> 49:50.621
Yeah, I can have fun with you.

49:50.655 --> 49:51.422
Great.

49:52.723 --> 49:54.692
So I've got an idea.

49:54.725 --> 49:56.527
What's that?

49:56.561 --> 49:58.696
Why don't you go get us two more beers

49:58.729 --> 50:01.099
and meet me down by the creek?

50:04.502 --> 50:06.171
Addison's Point?

50:06.204 --> 50:08.639
Yeah, you um, been down there?

50:08.673 --> 50:10.007
Yeah.

50:10.041 --> 50:11.742
- With a girl?
- Yeah.

50:14.112 --> 50:15.546
So you wanna go?

50:15.580 --> 50:17.648
Yeah, hell yeah, of course.

50:17.682 --> 50:18.883
Cool.

50:18.916 --> 50:19.717
Cool.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.388
- So, two more?
- Yeah.

50:23.421 --> 50:26.757
I have to see someone
first but I'll be there.

50:26.791 --> 50:28.025
I'll meet you there, right?

50:28.059 --> 50:29.260
I'll be there.

50:29.294 --> 50:30.294
This is the part when
the nice guy gets...

50:30.295 --> 50:32.430
Hooper, Hooper, Hooper.

50:34.765 --> 50:36.901
I'll be there, I promise.

50:42.207 --> 50:42.973
Oh boy.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.861
- Did he bring his homegirl?
- I don't think so.

51:03.894 --> 51:05.196
- Guess what?
- What?

51:05.230 --> 51:06.697
I ditched Hooper.

51:06.731 --> 51:07.898
Good.

51:07.932 --> 51:10.535
I want you to meet me in the woods.

51:10.568 --> 51:11.768
- Right now?
- Get that, homie.

51:11.769 --> 51:13.037
Right now.

51:13.070 --> 51:14.739
I'll be back in like 20, bro.

51:14.772 --> 51:17.575
You a quickie, man, straight up.

51:23.281 --> 51:25.316
Hey, what's uh, what's going on here?

51:25.350 --> 51:28.253
What you guys talking about?

51:28.286 --> 51:30.588
All of a sudden, what's up?

51:31.789 --> 51:33.758
Hold up, hold up, what about him, man?

51:33.791 --> 51:35.160
What's this about?

51:36.527 --> 51:39.130
Did she put a jinx on, what's going on?

51:39.164 --> 51:40.731
Huh?

51:40.765 --> 51:44.202
Hey listen, listen, I
don't wanna get involved.

51:46.937 --> 51:51.142
Oh Rivera's gonna kill
me, man, for this one.

51:51.176 --> 51:52.610
All of a sudden.

52:13.731 --> 52:14.532
Oh, what?

52:14.565 --> 52:15.900
It's like that?

53:01.412 --> 53:02.347
Caroline!

53:07.017 --> 53:08.519
Where you at, girl?

53:11.556 --> 53:12.557
Is that you?

53:20.365 --> 53:22.767
You playing hard to get now?

53:23.968 --> 53:27.037
Hey hey, ease up on the fucking neck.

53:33.744 --> 53:35.246
Don't, don't you...

53:45.490 --> 53:47.725
What the fuck, bitch, huh?

53:49.794 --> 53:51.228
What the fuck?

53:51.262 --> 53:52.062
Huh?

54:02.072 --> 54:03.140
What is that?

54:04.942 --> 54:05.943
Who is that?

54:22.627 --> 54:23.428
Help!

54:25.530 --> 54:26.664
Help me!

54:26.697 --> 54:27.498
No!

55:39.169 --> 55:40.371
Oh, come on.

55:47.211 --> 55:48.012
Caroline?

56:14.071 --> 56:15.039
Are you scared?

56:15.072 --> 56:17.808
No.

56:22.413 --> 56:23.948
Yeah, I'm scared.

56:50.274 --> 56:52.042
Come on, Hooper.

56:52.076 --> 56:52.843
Be a man.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.380
Take what you want.

57:44.161 --> 57:45.863
Take what you want.

57:56.073 --> 57:56.941
God.

58:01.145 --> 58:02.412
Yamura.

59:02.873 --> 59:04.408
Damon!

59:04.441 --> 59:05.442
Damon!

59:20.557 --> 59:23.393
Wow.

59:24.962 --> 59:27.632
I'm really embarrassed now.

59:27.665 --> 59:30.300
That was really fast.

59:30.334 --> 59:32.502
I really, really like you.

59:34.138 --> 59:34.939
Yeah?

59:36.106 --> 59:38.575
Yeah, I really like you too.

59:38.609 --> 59:39.610
I'm sorry.

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:03.834
Hey.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:19.483
So you're a hard one to figure out.

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:26.023
Most people are easy.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:33.664
But not you.

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:47.544
What?

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.816
You don't think I'm pretty?

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.362
I think you're beautiful.

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.037
See?

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:17.474
I just can't figure you out.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.376
What you're doing here.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.150
I'm here to help you.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.185
I don't need you help.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:32.389
There's something inside you.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:38.528
And you're gonna be the
one to take it out of me?

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.531
What makes you so special?

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:44.802
What is it!?

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:46.737
Who are you?

01:01:46.771 --> 01:01:47.571
Shh.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:51.375
I'm just a guy.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:55.245
And I perform exorcisms.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:57.714
And you need one.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:58.615
Back off!

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.124
And you need one.

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:13.563
What does Will have to say about that?

01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:14.564
Your father?

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:22.339
I don't have a father.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:26.143
Oh yes, you do.

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:28.178
I don't have a father.

01:02:30.014 --> 01:02:31.615
Which is really sad.

01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:35.452
Because the fact is,

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.956
a girl needs her daddy.

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:41.826
Caroline.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:45.462
Stop.

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:48.498
I can see you.

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:56.673
Oh, great.

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:02.112
Deputy Dumb-ass.

01:03:21.565 --> 01:03:23.100
I need to talk to you.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.501
About?

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.303
What were you doing tonight?

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.638
Just hanging out.

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:29.473
Why?

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:33.177
Do you know this man?

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:36.546
Nope.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.049
Never seen him before?

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:40.584
I don't know him.

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:47.657
I talk to a lot of people.

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:49.326
All these people you talk to,

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:51.395
are all found with their
throats ripped out,

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:52.997
and their heads damn-near taken off,

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.465
'cause that's what happened to him.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:56.901
Fresh kill?

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:59.870
Doug, you don't talk that
way to my daughter, alright?

01:03:59.904 --> 01:04:00.604
Alright?

01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:04.741
Now Caroline, you go to your room.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:05.575
Gladly.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.452
It's time, Damon, we
got a matter of minutes

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:20.390
before another five of
these deputies show up.

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:30.767
Fuck.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:33.737
What happened in that cave?

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:46.616
What the fuck did you
see in that cave, Damon?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.069
I saw her, Padre,

01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:08.672
show herself to me.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:10.774
Yamura.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:13.443
Show her!

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:17.447
Then everything is clear.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:20.650
And now my eyes.

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.654
I know what I am to do.

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:26.690
And I know where she is.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.695
So do I.

01:05:39.203 --> 01:05:41.105
What was that?

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:42.772
Stay in your room!

01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:43.707
Fuck off!

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:50.614
Get back in your room, now!

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:57.487
What the fuck is going on?

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:01.758
- What the fuck is going on?
- Deputy, lower your weapon!

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.527
Give that walkie, slowly.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.296
Look, your guns and your
officers will not help you here!

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.032
Give me that walkie, now!

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:17.741
What the fuck?

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.477
What the fuck!?

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.616
I told you, your gun
will not help you here!

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.285
That's a demon leaving his body!

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.054
No more bullshit,
you give me that walkie

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.322
or I put one straight between your eyes!

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:33.723
Father, do what he says, now!

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:36.626
Last chance, give me that walkie!

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.694
Do it!

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:41.831
Cuff him!

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:45.769
Help me.

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.276
Daddy.

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:54.578
Caroline?

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:56.446
Daddy.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.016
Caroline?

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:00.750
Daddy!

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:03.120
Caroline?

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:05.855
Baby?

01:07:05.889 --> 01:07:06.690
Listen.

01:07:08.292 --> 01:07:09.759
What's wrong?

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:12.429
- Daddy?
- Baby, what's wrong?

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:15.031
What's wrong?

01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:27.744
Come play with me.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:37.787
Hey!

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:39.756
Hey!

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.162
What?

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.598
What the fuck!

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.900
Play with me.

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:20.830
Come play with me.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.148
They're here, gotta hold them off!

01:08:38.182 --> 01:08:41.251
They can't come any
further, keep 'em out!

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:48.158
Fuck, fucking shit, Will.

01:08:48.192 --> 01:08:49.759
Untie me, man!

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:50.926
Will!

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.861
Fuck!

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:52.696
Oh my God.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.502
- It's okay.
- Fuck me.

01:08:58.535 --> 01:08:59.868
Oh, fuck.

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:02.506
- Fuck.
- Don't move, don't move.

01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:09.813
Okay, get up.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:10.880
Come on.

01:09:13.183 --> 01:09:15.385
You fucking cunts.

01:09:15.419 --> 01:09:16.220
Come on!

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.865
The name of the Lord!

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.466
The power!

01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:34.170
I command to release this girl!

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.493
You have no power here!

01:09:58.362 --> 01:10:00.730
In the name of our power!

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:05.569
In the name of...

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.471
You have no power here!

01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:10.940
You have no power!

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:16.613
I command you to
release from this woman!

01:10:44.274 --> 01:10:45.275
Do it, Damon!

01:10:45.309 --> 01:10:46.643
Do it, Damon!

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:47.977
Now!

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:50.213
- Daddy, don't do this.
- It has to be the way, Damon!

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.548
Don't hurt me.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.650
That's not her, that's not Caroline!

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:03.760
- Do it now!
- Caroline.

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:05.094
Caroline!

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:06.062
No!

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:06.963
- No!
- Do it, Damon!

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.231
Don't hurt me.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.999
No, no!

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:11.134
Damon, now!

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.341
Daddy, Daddy!

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:29.853
Daddy?

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:33.523
Please, don't hurt me!

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:37.461
No, no!

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:38.362
No!

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:39.195
Damon!

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:42.932
Damon!

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.100
Damon, now!

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:47.537
We don't have any time left, Damon!

01:12:33.617 --> 01:12:36.553
Come on!

01:12:43.059 --> 01:12:43.860
Doug!

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:48.197
Carter!

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:49.032
Carter!

01:12:51.635 --> 01:12:52.436
Carter!

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:11.187
No more monsters.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.489
No more monsters.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.511
I'll give you two a minute.

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:58.334
The last time I was fully possessed,

01:14:00.704 --> 01:14:02.005
I had a moment,

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.711
that I refer to as
complete demonic clarity.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:18.321
The demon had incorporated completely.

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.192
My mind was unclouded.

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:28.498
And I could see.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.172
I could see the monster.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.910
Then the monster raped my wife.

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:43.813
God.

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:52.355
So my daughter,

01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:56.726
your daughter,

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:01.731
is born of a demon.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.239
And I think that there's another reason

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.909
why she needs to know the truth.

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:13.743
Such as?

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:24.921
I don't know for sure.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:28.725
She might just be a normal girl,

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:32.395
or maybe not.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.967
Either way, she needs to know.

01:15:56.419 --> 01:15:58.421
You got anything harder?

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:51.434
Yamura.

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:42.478
I told you I'd saved her.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:47.416
I invited her inside me
to save your little girl.

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:00.964
What did you do?

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.501
10 years.

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:08.471
We've waited so long.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:13.142
You could be free, too.

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:14.978
All you have to do is give up control,

01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:18.147
then anything you want will be yours.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:22.018
You are not free.

01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:25.521
I know it's hard to let go, to give in,

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:29.758
but trust in me, brother,
and you will be glorious.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:39.168
No.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:55.584
God-damn, you're so fucking stubborn!

01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:58.521
What's inside of you belongs to us!

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:12.568
How much of you is even left?

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:15.871
It belongs to her!

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:17.740
It could be so beautiful.

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:21.610
Two twisted souls in one perfect vessel.

01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:22.912
She's right here.

01:22:15.131 --> 01:22:18.734
The demon inside you is
the father of your bearer.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.636
That's how she found you.

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:06.049
She's human.

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:10.319
She hasn't been born, brother.

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:16.059
Stop lying to yourself
and embrace the truth.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:31.800
We will have her soul
one way or another.

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:30.319
Padre.

01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:31.854
Padre.

01:26:31.887 --> 01:26:33.389
With me, brother?

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:36.959
Always.

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:41.630
My brother.

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:54.977
No, no, no.

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:57.980
No.

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:15.598
Thank you for what you did.

01:27:15.631 --> 01:27:16.565
Any time.

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.904
You did pretty good yourself.

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:24.807
Yeah.

01:27:26.275 --> 01:27:28.677
I'm sorry about your friend.

01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:35.718
I'm sorry about your father.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:37.453
He's not my father.

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.025
No time to mourn now.

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:46.194
Right?

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:52.401
Caroline, you've been through a lot.

01:27:52.435 --> 01:27:56.939
Mind, body, your soul, it
takes them time to heal.

01:27:56.972 --> 01:27:57.940
I'm leaving.
