(food sizzling)

00:36.763 --> 00:38.064
Wow, you guys.

00:38.097 --> 00:40.066
I've never been to a restaurant
where they cook

00:40.099 --> 00:41.568
right in front of you.

00:41.601 --> 00:43.670
Ugh. You know, later
we're going to have to take

00:43.703 --> 00:45.839
one of those forced
happiness family photos

00:45.872 --> 00:48.542
that come in the
restaurant's tacky frame.

00:48.575 --> 00:51.745
Why are you so (bleep)
negative all the time?

00:51.778 --> 00:55.415
I... uh... wha--
I don't-- uh, what?

00:55.449 --> 00:56.883
Come on,
you guys, relax.

00:56.916 --> 00:58.184
Let's have a fun night.

00:58.218 --> 00:59.586
We haven't done
anything as a family

00:59.619 --> 01:02.088
since we sat courtside
at that NBA game.

01:02.121 --> 01:04.391
(sneakers squeaking on court,
crowd gasps)

01:04.424 --> 01:05.725
You okay? You guys okay?

01:07.227 --> 01:08.562
Great seats.

01:08.595 --> 01:11.465
Yeah, it's a whole different
game when you sit down here.

01:15.869 --> 01:18.605
Huh, "samurai" or "geishas."

01:18.638 --> 01:19.839
Which one am I?

01:19.873 --> 01:21.875
I'll just wait till
somebody else goes in.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.512
Well, that wasn't helpful.

01:25.545 --> 01:27.781
Hmm, this one's holding a fan.

01:27.814 --> 01:30.717
That's usually what I need
when I'm done in a bathroom.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.118
Oop, no urinals.

01:32.151 --> 01:33.487
Must've guessed wrong.

01:35.955 --> 01:37.724
Wow, look at this place.

01:37.757 --> 01:40.294
There's candles, hand lotion.

01:40.327 --> 01:42.228
Whoa, there's not even
any swastikas

01:42.262 --> 01:43.730
carved into the toilet seat.

01:43.763 --> 01:45.532
And it's so peaceful.

01:45.565 --> 01:47.133
I haven't heard
a guy's booming fart

01:47.166 --> 01:48.768
the whole time
I've been in here.

01:48.802 --> 01:51.471
I feel more relaxed
than a chick on Facebook

01:51.505 --> 01:53.640
with her legs
in front of a pool.

01:54.841 --> 01:56.676
(notifications beeping)

02:06.353 --> 02:08.054
All right, Lois,
I'm off to the mall.

02:08.087 --> 02:09.489
I'll be back in
about 20 minutes.

02:09.523 --> 02:10.790
Oh, what are you gonna buy?

02:10.824 --> 02:12.992
Nothing. After the other
night, I made a decision:

02:13.026 --> 02:15.762
from now on, I'm only
using women's restrooms.

02:15.795 --> 02:17.764
What? You can't do that.
You're a man.

02:17.797 --> 02:18.932
You'll get in trouble.

02:18.965 --> 02:20.334
Oh, I got that covered.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.668
I'm going to
Anthropologie.

02:21.701 --> 02:23.437
I'll just ask them for
something so ridiculous,

02:23.470 --> 02:25.405
they'll have to check
in the back for it.

02:25.439 --> 02:28.107
And then I'll sneak into
their ladies' room.

02:28.141 --> 02:30.510
Yes, I'd like
a $4,000 ping-pong table

02:30.544 --> 02:32.011
that's shaped like
Easter Island.

02:32.045 --> 02:33.480
We have one
right over there.

02:36.683 --> 02:38.084
Okay.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.520
How about a telephone that's
made of vintage phone book paper

02:40.554 --> 02:43.623
and doesn't make or receive
phone calls or work in any way?

02:43.657 --> 02:45.559
You mean like this
one right here?

02:47.727 --> 02:49.763
Right, but what if I wanted...
Sir, sir?

02:49.796 --> 02:51.197
There's nothing you
can possibly imagine

02:51.230 --> 02:53.367
that's strange or useless
enough that we don't have it

02:53.400 --> 02:54.634
here at Anthropologie.

02:54.668 --> 02:57.804
I know one thing you don't have:
black customers.

02:57.837 --> 03:00.139
Ah! I'm melting!

03:00.173 --> 03:02.308
Ha-ha! To the ladies' room!

03:11.084 --> 03:13.353
Wow, this is the nicest one yet.

03:14.588 --> 03:16.990
Eh, what are the odds
she's gonna show up?

03:18.992 --> 03:20.293
(footsteps approaching)

03:20.326 --> 03:22.061
(woman clears throat)

03:24.263 --> 03:26.966
Did you get your ass kicked
by Meryl Streep?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.135
No, it was just some
low-class cockney woman

03:29.168 --> 03:31.505
from the mid-1800s
and-- (gasps)

03:31.538 --> 03:34.140
Bravo!

03:34.173 --> 03:35.742
She is amazing.

03:35.775 --> 03:37.276
(Meryl Streep's voice):
Thank you.

03:39.112 --> 03:40.914
Stay out of my crapper.

03:40.947 --> 03:43.082
(applause)

03:43.116 --> 03:45.151
And the Oscar goes to...

03:45.184 --> 03:48.588
Meryl Streep,
for Stay Out of My Crapper.

03:48.622 --> 03:50.590
(triumphant orchestral music
playing)

03:54.260 --> 03:56.463
(applause)

03:58.231 --> 04:00.600
Ah, the ladies' room
at Wimbledon.

04:00.634 --> 04:03.369
This must be the fanciest
bathroom in the world.

04:03.403 --> 04:05.238
Uh-oh, looks like
these are in use.

04:05.271 --> 04:07.974
(women grunting back and forth)

04:09.976 --> 04:11.244
(grunts loudly)

04:11.277 --> 04:12.579
(applause)

04:12.612 --> 04:14.748
Deuce.

04:19.819 --> 04:23.657
Hey, uh, don't tell Mom that
we don't use car seats with me.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.961
Unhand me!
What do you think you're doing?!

04:27.994 --> 04:30.964
Okay, Stewie, you're gonna
help Daddy by holding his iPad

04:30.997 --> 04:34.468
while he watches season
one of House of Cards.

04:34.501 --> 04:36.503
(House of Cards theme music
playing)

04:39.105 --> 04:40.640
Wh-- where was the house?

04:40.674 --> 04:42.542
Where was the
house of cards?

04:42.576 --> 04:44.644
All right, Stewie,
time to go.

04:44.678 --> 04:47.380
Whoa, whoa. (chuckles)
A little wobbly.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.082
Guess my legs fell asleep.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.249
(yells)

04:50.283 --> 04:51.818
Aah!

04:51.851 --> 04:54.821
Stewie, Daddy can't feel
his legs. Go get help!

04:54.854 --> 04:57.256
I'm hanging from a
door, you idiot!

04:57.290 --> 04:58.625
(yells)

04:58.658 --> 05:00.293
(grunts)

05:00.326 --> 05:03.262
By the way, you're down
to five percent battery.

05:03.296 --> 05:05.899
Oh, damn it, my head.

05:05.932 --> 05:08.267
Well, no wonder-- you're
running all the apps at once.

05:08.301 --> 05:09.669
(groans)

05:09.703 --> 05:12.606
MAN:
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

05:14.674 --> 05:16.075
There he is.

05:16.109 --> 05:17.644
Welcome back, buddy.

05:17.677 --> 05:18.512
Who are you?

05:18.545 --> 05:19.746
I'm a paramedic.

05:19.779 --> 05:21.180
Name's Stryker Foxx.

05:21.214 --> 05:22.348
(bell chimes)

05:22.381 --> 05:23.817
Oh, Lois just texted.

05:23.850 --> 05:25.685
"Burgers or meatballs
for dinner?"

05:25.719 --> 05:27.320
I'll text back for you.

05:27.353 --> 05:31.491
"Same thing, bitch.
Just different shapes."

05:31.525 --> 05:32.959
(iPad chiming rapidly)

05:32.992 --> 05:34.828
(chuckles):
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

05:34.861 --> 05:36.362
Oh, battery died.

05:36.395 --> 05:38.331
Sir, you've sustained
a head injury.

05:38.364 --> 05:41.334
How many chicken fingers am I
holding up, and do you want one?

05:41.367 --> 05:43.770
Three, and hell yeah!

05:43.803 --> 05:46.172
Mmm. Aw. These are amazing!

05:46.205 --> 05:47.841
Did I die and go to heaven?

05:47.874 --> 05:49.142
Well, you didn't die,
'cause I saved you.

05:49.175 --> 05:50.376
And you're not in heaven

05:50.409 --> 05:51.878
'cause you're not holding
a margarita.

05:51.911 --> 05:53.479
Oh, wait a minute,
yes, you are.

05:53.513 --> 05:55.782
You brought a lot of food
in the bathroom.

05:55.815 --> 05:57.316
I always do.

05:58.752 --> 06:00.219
Oh, my God.

06:00.253 --> 06:02.188
Are you the coolest guy ever?

06:02.221 --> 06:04.223
Ah, that's just a silly
title they gave me

06:04.257 --> 06:06.059
down at the Karate
Paintball Dirt Bike Club.

06:06.092 --> 06:07.193
Awesome!

06:07.226 --> 06:08.728
Okay, well,
bandaged you up.

06:08.762 --> 06:10.496
You should be good to go.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.632
But just be more
careful next time.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.167
I know.
What a stupid injury, huh?

06:14.200 --> 06:15.501
I haven't been
this embarrassed

06:15.535 --> 06:17.637
since I was
a rookie firefighter.

06:17.671 --> 06:19.673
(alarm ringing)

06:22.776 --> 06:25.344
PETER: Sorry, first day.
Still learning.

06:29.749 --> 06:31.217
Hey, Stryker, wait!

06:31.250 --> 06:33.186
Hey, listen, I just
wanted to say thanks again

06:33.219 --> 06:34.187
for patching me up.

06:34.220 --> 06:35.421
No problem, buddy.

06:35.454 --> 06:37.991
Hey, that's an interesting
necklace you got there.

06:38.024 --> 06:39.859
Oh, this?
It's from when I was a kid.

06:39.893 --> 06:41.661
It's half of
a "best friend" coin.

06:41.695 --> 06:43.162
I always had this crazy dream

06:43.196 --> 06:45.899
that one day I'd run into
the guy with the other half.

06:50.236 --> 06:52.438
Oh, my God. Cody?

06:52.471 --> 06:55.308
Oh, that must be the name of the
dead surfer I found this on.

07:02.315 --> 07:04.117
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to the Olympics.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.451
Ugh, it's so annoying.

07:05.484 --> 07:06.920
They always use
football announcers

07:06.953 --> 07:09.022
for events they
know nothing about.

07:09.055 --> 07:11.124
ANNOUNCER: The players are ready
to take the swimming field.

07:11.157 --> 07:12.125
(alarm buzzes)

07:12.158 --> 07:13.526
And they're swimming!

07:13.559 --> 07:15.228
They appear to be doing
the forward stroke.

07:15.261 --> 07:16.562
My neighbor has a pool.

07:16.596 --> 07:19.065
I'll take a dip
if I know they're on vacation.

07:19.098 --> 07:21.467
It's neck-and-neck,
and it looks like Canada won!

07:21.500 --> 07:23.670
Uh, no, they're going back
the other way.

07:24.738 --> 07:26.472
What do you think?
How do I look?

07:26.505 --> 07:28.074
Like a gas station
energy drink.

07:28.107 --> 07:30.309
But you put that on
to go to the Clam?

07:30.343 --> 07:32.578
Aren't the guys gonna think
you're a little overdressed?

07:32.612 --> 07:33.947
Oh, I'm not hanging out
with the guys.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.248
I met someone new.

07:35.281 --> 07:37.951
His name's Stryker
and he's really cool.

07:37.984 --> 07:40.319
Like, he's one of those guys
whose forearm hair

07:40.353 --> 07:42.321
makes his watch
look even cooler.

07:42.355 --> 07:43.657
(phone ringing)

07:43.690 --> 07:44.991
(gasps)
It's Stryker!

07:45.024 --> 07:47.761
I want him to think
I was listening to a cool song.

07:47.794 --> 07:49.228
♪ Pump up the jam... ♪

07:49.262 --> 07:50.329
Yeah, who dis?

07:50.363 --> 07:51.497
Oh, hey, man.

07:51.530 --> 07:53.332
Oh, nothing much.
Just getting slurped.

07:53.366 --> 07:54.233
Ew.

07:54.267 --> 07:55.268
Oh, you're almost here?

07:55.301 --> 07:57.070
Okay, just, uh,
just give me a second

07:57.103 --> 07:59.338
so I can put away
all my guitars.

07:59.372 --> 08:01.007
Okay, Seacrest out. Bye.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.008
(music stops)

08:02.041 --> 08:03.409
What the hell was that?

08:03.442 --> 08:04.744
Lay off. Nothing.

08:04.778 --> 08:06.179
(knock on door)

08:07.313 --> 08:08.414
Hey, Peter.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.515
Hey, man.

08:09.548 --> 08:10.750
Hola, cha-cha, hi-hi.

08:10.784 --> 08:12.018
Peter!

08:12.051 --> 08:13.352
I don't know.
It's-it's this house.

08:13.386 --> 08:15.488
I-I got to get
out of this house.

08:15.521 --> 08:17.590
Boy, Dad sure seems excited.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.292
I know. I haven't
seen him this giddy

08:19.325 --> 08:22.461
since he discovered that
single-loop roller coaster.

08:22.495 --> 08:23.462

Wow, what a cool loft.

08:49.222 --> 08:52.391
I bet it cost a ton to
make this place look unfinished.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.027
Hey, come over here.
There's someone I want

08:54.060 --> 08:57.563
to introduce you to:
1997 George Clooney.

08:57.596 --> 09:00.533
Wow! That's the coolest
George Clooney there is!

09:00.566 --> 09:03.236
Hi, George Clooney,
second worst Batman.

09:03.269 --> 09:04.804
Peter Griffin,
second best Homer.

09:04.838 --> 09:06.572
You may have heard,
I'm also known

09:06.605 --> 09:08.574
for my practical
jokes on the set.

09:08.607 --> 09:11.577
One time, I nailed Nora Dunn
in the head with an apple.

09:11.610 --> 09:14.080
(laughs): That-That's hilarious
'cause you're handsome.

09:14.113 --> 09:16.883
Otherwise, you're just
some dick who hit a lady.

09:16.916 --> 09:18.651
Aw, thanks for bringing
me here, Stryker.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.019
I'm having the
best time ever.

09:20.053 --> 09:22.455
Even better than when
I lived in Santa Fe.

09:24.223 --> 09:26.592
Have you ever seen
a prettier sunset?

09:26.625 --> 09:27.593
Never.

09:27.626 --> 09:29.495
It's just so peaceful here.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.764
It sure is.

09:30.797 --> 09:32.732
Mm. Sure is.

09:32.766 --> 09:35.835
Did you also have a very public
meltdown in another city?

09:35.869 --> 09:37.236
I did.

09:37.270 --> 09:40.306
Yeah. Yeah.

09:44.277 --> 09:46.312
(knock on door)

09:49.215 --> 09:50.583
Ugh, it's the guys.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.018
What do those losers want?

09:52.051 --> 09:54.087
Losers? Those are your friends.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.221
Nah, they're lame.

09:55.254 --> 09:57.957
Not one of them
has ever vaped at a funeral.

09:57.991 --> 10:00.059
Hey, Peter.
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

10:00.093 --> 10:01.294
We're gonna
watch Cleveland

10:01.327 --> 10:03.797
put a garbage can full of coins
in a Coinstar.

10:03.830 --> 10:06.232
Sometimes it takes my buttons.

10:06.265 --> 10:08.301
Eh, thanks, guys,
but I-I can't make it.

10:08.334 --> 10:10.603
I'm, um, I'm getting
re-circumcised.

10:10.636 --> 10:11.805
Got a wedding next week.

10:11.838 --> 10:13.739
I just want to
clean it up a bit.

10:13.773 --> 10:15.474
Oh, well, that's too bad.
Yeah, maybe next time.

10:15.508 --> 10:17.643
That sounds horrible.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.745
Peter, why did you
just lie to the guys?

10:19.779 --> 10:21.414
'Cause I got plans
with Stryker.

10:21.447 --> 10:22.982
I don't want them
to embarrass me.

10:23.016 --> 10:24.583
Eh, I get
where he's coming from.

10:24.617 --> 10:26.752
That's why I never
introduce you to my friends.

10:26.786 --> 10:27.821
What friends?

10:27.854 --> 10:30.323
Like the guys
in my photography club.

10:30.356 --> 10:32.658
"Dear Gary Glitter,
Jeffrey Jones

10:32.691 --> 10:34.393
"and Jared from Subway,

10:34.427 --> 10:36.996
"I feel like I'm the only one
sending pics.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.998
"I love all
the positive feedback,

10:39.032 --> 10:40.934
"but maybe you guys send a pic?

Anyway, here's more pics."

10:50.476 --> 10:52.511
Hey, you ever try
that? Wingsuiting?

10:52.545 --> 10:53.980
I mean, basically, yeah.

10:54.013 --> 10:55.748
One time, I jumped
off a top bunk

10:55.781 --> 10:57.817
with a towel
around my neck like a cape.

10:57.851 --> 10:59.452
It was inside the IKEA.

10:59.485 --> 11:01.187
I landed on
a cardboard computer.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.189
We should totally
do that sometime.

11:03.222 --> 11:04.623
Nah, I can't go back there.

11:04.657 --> 11:06.225
They got my picture
by the door.

11:08.061 --> 11:09.528
Hey, he is in here.

11:09.562 --> 11:11.697
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

11:11.730 --> 11:13.366
We were coming back
from the Coinstar

11:13.399 --> 11:15.034
and saw your car out front.

11:15.068 --> 11:17.837
Rough night. Turns out
the can was all buttons.

11:17.871 --> 11:19.372
We're not gonna
make our mortgage.

11:19.405 --> 11:20.639
What are you doing here?

11:20.673 --> 11:22.675
I thought you were too busy
to go out tonight.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.043
Peter, who are
your friends?

11:24.077 --> 11:28.982
Oh, um... Stryker, this is
Quagmire, Joe and Cleveland.

11:29.015 --> 11:30.383
How do you two know each other?

11:30.416 --> 11:32.185
Did you meet at
the Harry Potter store?

11:32.218 --> 11:33.619
Peter loves that place.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.389
It was one wand and I was
using a gift certificate.

11:36.422 --> 11:38.958
No, we actually met when I was
administering first aid to him.

11:38.992 --> 11:40.960
I'm a paramedic.
For real?

11:40.994 --> 11:43.562
Hey, can I show you seven
or eight things on my body

11:43.596 --> 11:45.798
and ask for
medical diagnosises?

11:45.831 --> 11:47.901
This thing here that looks
like a second elbow,

11:47.934 --> 11:49.368
I don't know what it is.

11:49.402 --> 11:50.904
Feels like it's filled
with liquid.

11:50.937 --> 11:52.805
Well, I could
take a look at it.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.740
No, no, no, guys, guys,
it's his night off.

11:54.773 --> 11:55.909
I have two pee holes.

11:55.942 --> 11:57.911
Stop it! Stop it.
Guys, can I talk to you?

11:57.944 --> 11:59.979
Look, this,
this right here

12:00.013 --> 12:01.915
is exactly why
I've been avoiding you.

12:01.948 --> 12:04.050
I knew you'd embarrass me
in front of Stryker.

12:04.083 --> 12:05.651
Who cares? He's
just some dude.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.153
He's not "just some dude."

12:07.186 --> 12:09.222
He happens to be
the first really cool friend

12:09.255 --> 12:10.423
I've ever had.

12:10.456 --> 12:12.191
What are you talking about?
We're cool.

12:12.225 --> 12:13.759
You are
absolutely not cool.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.161
Oh, yeah?

12:15.194 --> 12:17.430
Well, then why did those
teenagers on the way in say,

12:17.463 --> 12:18.932
"Cool wheelchair, dick"?

12:18.965 --> 12:20.733
Hey, look, Peter,
if you're so embarrassed by us

12:20.766 --> 12:22.101
and you think we're losers,

12:22.135 --> 12:23.903
well, then we don't want
to hang out with you, either.

12:23.937 --> 12:26.105
Good. Who needs you bums?
I got Stryker.

12:26.139 --> 12:27.273
Oh, yeah?

12:27.306 --> 12:30.443
Well, I hope you two are
happy together, you jerk.

12:30.476 --> 12:32.511
BOY:
Cool wheelchair, dick.

12:32.545 --> 12:35.481
JOE: Thanks. Did you see
the backpack hanging off it?

12:47.826 --> 12:49.028
Wow, you know,

12:49.062 --> 12:50.763
I never thought I could be
talked into wingsuiting.

12:50.796 --> 12:52.031
You're gonna love it.

12:52.065 --> 12:53.967
It's just a short hike
from here to the summit.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.102
A hike? It's no problem.

12:56.135 --> 12:58.604
Shouldn't affect
my old football injury.

12:58.637 --> 13:00.306
I spilled hot chili
on my nuts.

13:00.339 --> 13:02.041
(laughs)
You're a riot, Peter.

13:02.075 --> 13:04.277
Hey, you sure
you're up for this?

13:04.310 --> 13:07.446
Oh, hell yeah. When I commit
to something, I go all the way,

13:07.480 --> 13:09.949
like when I had
Kathleen Turner's voice.

13:09.983 --> 13:12.251
(Kathleen Turner's voice):
Good morning, guys.

13:12.285 --> 13:13.987
Peter, what's wrong
with your voice?

13:14.020 --> 13:16.389
I got punched in the throat
at the Clam last night.

13:16.422 --> 13:19.125
Now I sound exactly
like Kathleen Turner.

13:19.158 --> 13:21.260
I'm just gonna
get my stromboli.

13:21.294 --> 13:24.063
Hey! Get away from
my stromboli, Kathleen Turner!

13:24.097 --> 13:25.364
(shouts)

13:36.375 --> 13:39.745
Wow, that's, uh...
that's some view.

13:39.778 --> 13:40.846
I know, isn't it?

13:40.879 --> 13:42.648
You see that
rock formation over there?

13:42.681 --> 13:45.018
We're gonna fly right
through the center of it.

13:45.051 --> 13:46.685
It's called
threading the needle.

13:46.719 --> 13:48.187
Totally intense.

13:48.221 --> 13:50.656
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.
Or-or how about this?

13:50.689 --> 13:52.591
Maybe you jump
off this cliff

13:52.625 --> 13:55.594
and I spin around over there
and sing Sound of Music.

13:55.628 --> 13:58.031
Or-or we could just go home
and watch Sound of Music.

13:58.064 --> 13:59.698
I can see you're
a little nervous, Peter,

13:59.732 --> 14:01.867
but I'm telling you,
it is easier than you think.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.636
Watch.

14:04.637 --> 14:06.405
♪

14:16.915 --> 14:19.118
Wow, look at him go.

14:19.152 --> 14:20.453
You know, just
when I thought

14:20.486 --> 14:23.389
he couldn't get any cooler,
he goes... holy (bleep)!

14:23.422 --> 14:25.324
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

14:25.358 --> 14:28.327
Oh! What-what just-- There's
almost nothing left of him!

14:28.361 --> 14:30.563
And I just know
I'm gonna be the one

14:30.596 --> 14:32.265
to have to identify the body.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.570
(crying):
That's him. Poor guy.

14:37.603 --> 14:39.572
He looks like a bowl
of tomato soup.

14:39.605 --> 14:41.474
Guy next to him
died in a fire.

14:41.507 --> 14:44.410
He looks like a
grilled cheese sandwich.

14:44.443 --> 14:47.980
Oh, these two poor souls
are the best combination

14:48.013 --> 14:49.282
for a rainy Saturday.

14:56.289 --> 14:58.824
So, hey, guys.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.926
What are we drinking? Beer?

15:00.959 --> 15:04.063
Hey, Quagmire, how about one
of your famous sexual stories?

15:04.097 --> 15:05.264
Take a hike, Peter.

15:05.298 --> 15:07.433
Ah, oh, you-you mean
something Joe can't do?

15:07.466 --> 15:08.534
(laughs)

15:08.567 --> 15:10.603
Friendly jokes
indicating closeness.

15:10.636 --> 15:12.338
We heard about
Stryker dying.

15:12.371 --> 15:13.439
Ah, craps.

15:13.472 --> 15:14.607
Yeah, give it up.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.342
We know the only
reason you're here

15:16.375 --> 15:18.444
is 'cause your cool
friend is gone.

15:18.477 --> 15:20.679
That's right. We're not
your floppy seconds, Peter.

15:20.713 --> 15:21.747
It's actually "sloppy."

15:21.780 --> 15:23.048
Well, for me, it's both.

15:23.082 --> 15:24.617
But listen, you really
hurt our feelings.

15:24.650 --> 15:26.785
You can't just treat us like
garbage and then expect us

15:26.819 --> 15:28.587
to take you back
like nothing happened.

15:28.621 --> 15:31.424
Okay, that's-that's too bad
'cause that was kind of my plan.

15:31.457 --> 15:32.791
Well, you can go to hell, Peter.

15:32.825 --> 15:34.693
We're tired of you
taking us for granted.

15:34.727 --> 15:36.195
Yeah, and this isn't
even the first time

15:36.229 --> 15:37.763
you ditched us
for someone else.

15:37.796 --> 15:38.964
Remember when
you blew us off

15:38.997 --> 15:40.999
to hang out with
Jerry Seinfeld?

15:43.102 --> 15:45.871
Julia Louis-Dreyfus
has a lot of Emmys now.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.906
Yeah.

15:50.609 --> 15:53.846
Why did your wife
steal that cookbook?

15:58.517 --> 16:01.154
Peter, I'm sorry
about your friend Stryker.

16:01.187 --> 16:03.656
I know it's got to be hard
to watch a man explode

16:03.689 --> 16:05.291
like a bug on a windshield.

16:05.324 --> 16:06.592
No, it's not that--

16:06.625 --> 16:09.061
I mean, I do see that
every time I close my eyes--

16:09.094 --> 16:10.629
but it's the guys.

16:10.663 --> 16:12.498
They're really mad at
me, and I'm-I'm afraid

16:12.531 --> 16:14.500
they don't want to be
friends with me anymore.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.135
Well, it's hard
to blame them.

16:16.169 --> 16:18.671
You treated them like
you don't even care about them.

16:18.704 --> 16:20.639
I do care about them.

16:20.673 --> 16:23.509
It's just, when I hung
around with Stryker,

16:23.542 --> 16:26.579
people thought I was cool,
and it-it felt good.

16:26.612 --> 16:28.747
No one ever thinks I'm cool.

16:28.781 --> 16:32.251
Your friends thought you were
cool, until you dumped them.

16:32.285 --> 16:35.120
Oh, wow, I guess you're right.

16:35.154 --> 16:37.590
I treated them like crap.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.193
I just got to find a way
to make it up to 'em.

16:40.226 --> 16:41.427
You got any ideas?

16:41.460 --> 16:44.363
Mom? Dad?
Can Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones

16:44.397 --> 16:46.565
and Jared from Subway
spend the night?

16:48.401 --> 16:49.602
I don't know, Peter,

16:49.635 --> 16:51.370
but it's got to be
something really meaningful,

16:51.404 --> 16:53.038
because imagine
how they feel.

16:53.071 --> 16:56.342
After all, you were willing
to jump off a cliff for Stryker.

16:56.375 --> 16:58.711
Well, they didn't say yes,
but they didn't say no.

16:58.744 --> 17:00.313
You're right.

17:00.346 --> 17:01.614
Thanks, Lois.

17:01.647 --> 17:05.218
And now I know exactly
what I have to do.

17:07.052 --> 17:08.554
Uh, where the hell
are you going?

17:08.587 --> 17:10.489
Lois told me to go
jump off a cliff

17:10.523 --> 17:12.124
to prove my friendship
to the guys.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.793
Are-are you, are you sure
that's what she said?

17:14.827 --> 17:16.795
I-I don't know, Brian.
Her shirt was kind of open.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.464
I was trying to get
a peek down there.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.599
Anyway, I got to go
jump off a cliff.

17:24.570 --> 17:27.573
Peter, wait. H-Hold on.
This is crazy!

17:27.606 --> 17:28.574
Damn it.

17:28.607 --> 17:30.075
Where's Peter going?

17:30.108 --> 17:31.910
Huh?

17:31.944 --> 17:34.112
Oh, for God's sake.

17:40.953 --> 17:43.522
Hey, Quagmire,
Cleveland and Joe.

17:43.556 --> 17:46.925
It's your buddy, Peter, and
I'm about to thread the needle

17:46.959 --> 17:49.228
to prove to you guys
how sorry I am

17:49.262 --> 17:51.597
and that I'd do anything
to win you back.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.866
And if something goes wrong
and I don't survive,

17:53.899 --> 17:55.234
you can go ahead and delete

17:55.268 --> 17:57.336
the Kennedy Center Honors
from my DVR.

17:57.370 --> 17:58.837
I'm-I'm never gonna watch that.

17:58.871 --> 18:01.206
Okay, here goes nothing.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.610

Why are you wearing
a douche suit?

18:17.890 --> 18:19.191
They also make wipes!

I'd respect the majority.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.402
Look, you really
treated us badly,

18:29.435 --> 18:30.903
but the fact
that you'd be willing

18:30.936 --> 18:34.239
to literally risk your life just
to show us how much you care,

18:34.273 --> 18:36.475
well, that says a lot.

18:36.509 --> 18:39.144
Listen, I'm so sorry.

18:39.177 --> 18:42.481
If being cool means I don't get
to hang out with you guys,

18:42.515 --> 18:44.817
then I don't ever
want to be cool.

18:44.850 --> 18:48.153
What do you say? Can we just
go back to being friends?

18:48.186 --> 18:49.988
Of course.
You bet.

18:50.022 --> 18:51.223
Totes McGoats.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.292
(laughs)
"Totes McGoats"?

18:53.326 --> 18:55.494
Maybe you guys are cool.
Fist bump.

18:55.528 --> 18:56.629
Ah, crap!

18:56.662 --> 18:58.564
(screams)
Oh, my God!
Peter!

18:58.597 --> 19:00.333
Should I shoot him,
make it go quicker?

19:00.366 --> 19:01.634
I got a shot.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.736
Too late. You didn't
answer quick enough.

19:03.769 --> 19:05.203
(screaming)

19:13.712 --> 19:15.481
PETER:
Hey, I'm doing it.

19:15.514 --> 19:17.350
This ain't so hard.

19:17.383 --> 19:19.352
Guys, I'm gonna do it!

19:19.385 --> 19:21.086
I'm gonna thread the needle!

19:21.119 --> 19:23.088
QUAGMIRE:
What? We can't hear you!

19:23.121 --> 19:24.890
We're very far away!

19:29.628 --> 19:31.497
Oh, my God, I did it!

19:31.530 --> 19:33.031
I was actually able
to thread the--

19:33.065 --> 19:34.700
Oh, crap, Canadian goose.

19:34.733 --> 19:35.701
Look out, eh?

19:35.734 --> 19:37.202
(screaming)

19:37.235 --> 19:38.604
(birds squawking)

19:38.637 --> 19:41.006
Oh! Damn it! Ah! Son of a bitch!

19:41.039 --> 19:42.040
(screaming)

19:42.074 --> 19:44.377
(grunting)

19:45.978 --> 19:48.213
(groans)

19:48.246 --> 19:49.948
I think I'm okay.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.050
Ah, nickels!

19:55.754 --> 19:57.723
Well, it's good
to be back, you guys.

19:57.756 --> 20:00.459
A-And I'm sorry again
I dumped you for Stryker.

20:00.493 --> 20:02.728
Who the hell is this Stryker guy
you keep talking about?

20:02.761 --> 20:03.962
What do you mean?

20:03.996 --> 20:05.898
He's that cool, handsome guy
I was friends with.

20:05.931 --> 20:08.634
He's the whole reason I went
wingsuiting and hurt my head.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.968
Wingsuiting?

20:10.002 --> 20:12.405
Peter, you hurt your head
in a ladies' bathroom.

20:12.438 --> 20:14.907
Yeah, your legs fell asleep and
you bashed it against a sink.

20:14.940 --> 20:16.809
You were in a coma
for two weeks.

20:16.842 --> 20:19.578
You must've dreamed about
this Stryker or something.

20:19.612 --> 20:20.913
No, we were buddies.

20:20.946 --> 20:22.581
We rode on his motorcycle.

20:22.615 --> 20:25.551
And he introduced me
to 1997 George Clooney.

20:25.584 --> 20:28.053
Okay, well, right there you
should've known it wasn't real.

20:28.086 --> 20:29.388
Huh.

20:29.422 --> 20:31.189
Well, whether it was
real or not,

20:31.223 --> 20:35.060
I want you to know you are
the best friends I've ever had.

20:35.093 --> 20:36.595
Of course we know that, Peter.

20:36.629 --> 20:38.397
Yeah, and we feel
the same way.

20:38.431 --> 20:40.533
Hey, this is
a really weird question,

20:40.566 --> 20:43.569
but do you boys
want to go out dancing?

20:43.602 --> 20:45.237
♪
PETER: That night,

20:45.270 --> 20:46.939
we danced until
the sun came up.

20:46.972 --> 20:48.774
We forgot all about my coma

20:48.807 --> 20:50.943
and my crazy dream
about a cool guy.

20:50.976 --> 20:53.178
We were just
four middle-aged men

20:53.211 --> 20:55.748
doing Ecstasy
at a Mexican prom.

20:55.781 --> 20:57.983
I'm Peter Griffin,
and these are my stories.
