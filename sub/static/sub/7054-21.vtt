the machines

06:19.804 --> 06:20.920
Okay, so what am I
looking at?

06:20.971 --> 06:22.639
This is a box.

06:22.723 --> 06:24.891
This is the key
that opens the box.

06:24.942 --> 06:26.142
Well, what's inside the box?

06:26.227 --> 06:28.144
According to this,
it's a crowbar of sorts.

06:28.229 --> 06:31.448
- <i>A crowbar?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

06:31.532 --> 06:32.732
It'll pry the force field
open long enough

06:32.800 --> 06:33.867
for Peter to get in.

06:33.934 --> 06:36.653
And what happens if he does?

06:36.720 --> 06:38.488
- Does he die?
- No.

06:38.572 --> 06:39.589
I don't think so.

06:39.657 --> 06:40.974
You don't think so?

06:41.041 --> 06:43.159
As I understand it,
the machine is indestructible.

he should be safe.

06:48.115 --> 06:51.468

07:01.595 --> 07:03.313
I suppose loading fruit
with sugar,

07:03.397 --> 07:06.432

08:09.129 --> 08:10.529

08:10.581 --> 08:13.199
I went so far as
to ask God for help.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.051
How did he respond?
Nothing.

08:15.135 --> 08:17.337

Come on now.

13:04.824 --> 13:06.709
Are you a patient?

13:11.498 --> 13:13.049
I need a crash cart in here.

13:13.133 --> 13:14.800
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

14:02.411 --> 14:04.412
Taxi!

14:11.379 --> 14:12.713
Where you headed, pal?

14:12.788 --> 14:14.138
<i>42nd and Lex, please.</i>

14:14.223 --> 14:15.223
Come again?

14:15.290 --> 14:17.509
42nd and Lex, Midtown.

14:20.980 --> 14:21.913
Are you feeling okay?

14:21.981 --> 14:24.732
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.251
42nd and Lexington

14:26.318 --> 14:29.187
is in New York,
and we are in Pittsfield.

14:29.271 --> 14:30.555
That's a pretty
steep fare.

14:48.674 --> 14:50.592
42nd and Lex it is.

15:08.444 --> 15:12.447
Appears we've got
another problem.

15:12.514 --> 15:16.350
The key is in there,
the Whitley Museum.

15:16.402 --> 15:18.703
Mayor's office has us
setting up safety zones

15:18.771 --> 15:20.655
at locations of all
the lightning storms.

15:20.706 --> 15:21.990
So what's the radius?

15:22.041 --> 15:23.291
Oh, this one's six blocks.

15:23.358 --> 15:24.592
We've had bigger.

15:24.660 --> 15:27.462
Quincy, Somerville,
two at Southie.

15:27.529 --> 15:28.880
I barely have enough manpower
to keep up.

15:28.964 --> 15:30.698
Oh, that's her.
Museum director.

15:30.749 --> 15:32.333
<i>I don't care if it's</i>
<i>the bloody apocalypse.</i>

15:32.384 --> 15:33.701
I'm not leaving
my museum unattended.

15:33.752 --> 15:35.470
You remember what happened
in Baghdad.

15:35.537 --> 15:36.888
Listen, I'll call you
back later.

15:36.972 --> 15:38.673
Uh, ma'am, this is the Agent
I spoke to you about.

15:38.724 --> 15:40.425
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

15:40.509 --> 15:42.060
Dr. Christine Albright.

15:42.144 --> 15:45.313
Sam Weiss,
patron member since '82.

15:47.399 --> 15:49.267
Thank you so much
for meeting us.

15:49.351 --> 15:51.069
Are those the floor plans?
Mm-hmm.

15:51.153 --> 15:53.721
<i>There.</i>

15:53.772 --> 15:55.189
<i>That's where the key is.</i>

15:55.240 --> 15:57.075
You sure?
Positive.

15:57.159 --> 15:58.192
That's the Native
American Wing.

15:58.243 --> 15:59.861
I curated those exhibits
myself.

15:59.912 --> 16:01.529
<i>There's no key in there.</i>
I beg to differ.

16:01.580 --> 16:05.366
Okay, what's the most direct
route to that wing?

16:05.417 --> 16:06.567
You mean you want to go in?
You can't.

16:06.619 --> 16:07.952
It's not safe.

16:08.037 --> 16:10.237
Battalion commander said he'd
never seen anything like it.

16:10.289 --> 16:11.623
Lightning coming out
of thin air.

16:11.707 --> 16:12.757
Inside the museum?

16:12.841 --> 16:15.209
Inside all the buildings
on the block.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.261
Okay, well, that's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

16:18.747 --> 16:19.764
Uh, go through
the front entrance.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.132
<i>That's the quickest route.</i>

16:21.216 --> 16:22.850
Please be considerate.

16:22.918 --> 16:24.602
We've lost enough priceless
artwork for one day.

16:24.687 --> 16:26.688
You have our word.

16:32.778 --> 16:34.145
Here's everything,

16:34.229 --> 16:36.447
including the latest raw data
from Massive Dynamic.

16:36.532 --> 16:37.565
Excellent.

16:37.616 --> 16:39.484
Let's mark all the spots

16:39.568 --> 16:41.268
where lightning has struck
more than once.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.604
Because lightning
shouldn't strike twice?

16:45.324 --> 16:46.457
No, that's a myth.

16:46.542 --> 16:48.660
As we know,
lightning can and does

16:48.744 --> 16:50.244
strike twice,
given the right conditions.

16:50.295 --> 16:53.131
But the frequency of multiple
strikes, that we measure.

16:53.215 --> 16:54.966
You think this is gonna
give us the pattern?

16:55.050 --> 16:56.384
No, not by itself.

16:56.451 --> 16:57.969
But when we compare it
to the frequency

16:58.053 --> 17:02.090
of seismic events and multiple
radiation and thermal spikes...

17:02.141 --> 17:05.393
Maybe.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.729
Okay.

17:10.265 --> 17:13.317
Seismic...

17:13.402 --> 17:16.487
and radiation...

17:16.571 --> 17:20.808
and thermal.

17:20.858 --> 17:22.944
What do you see, dear?

17:22.994 --> 17:24.645
<i>These x's line up perfectly.</i>

17:24.696 --> 17:26.664
And what else?

17:26.749 --> 17:28.983
Fringe events seem to be
clustered around two points.

17:29.034 --> 17:30.118
The foci.

17:30.169 --> 17:32.253
And a rift seems
to be forming

17:32.320 --> 17:33.955
on the axis between them,

17:34.006 --> 17:35.339
like they're tugging
at each other.

17:35.424 --> 17:37.208
Walter, this is
the exact location

17:37.292 --> 17:38.710
where our machine is housed.

17:38.794 --> 17:42.096
But why Liberty Island?

17:42.164 --> 17:45.283
Walternate.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.435
Do you understand
what you're suggesting?

17:47.502 --> 17:49.387
We're talking mass panic.

17:49.471 --> 17:52.673
Do you have a contingency plan
in place for that?

17:52.725 --> 17:54.358
Hold on.

17:54.443 --> 17:55.943
I'll call you back.

18:00.249 --> 18:03.885
Here we go.
A simple visual demonstration.

18:03.952 --> 18:06.170
It's important that you
pay attention.

18:12.728 --> 18:15.713
These two magnets...

18:21.470 --> 18:24.405
create a magnetic field
between them.

18:24.473 --> 18:27.158
As a result,
these iron filings

18:27.242 --> 18:29.994
line up in a pattern
consistent with that field.

18:30.079 --> 18:31.145
Your point?

18:31.196 --> 18:32.447
The two machines,
they're acting

18:32.498 --> 18:34.082
just like the magnets.

18:34.149 --> 18:36.417
Only in this case,
across universes.

18:36.485 --> 18:39.537
The pull between them
creating this swath of events.

18:39.621 --> 18:40.838
<i>At one end,</i>
<i>the hangar</i>

18:40.923 --> 18:42.457
<i>where we keep our machine.</i>

18:42.508 --> 18:44.292
The other end:
Liberty Island.

18:44.359 --> 18:47.111
The location of the Department
of Defense Headquarters

18:47.179 --> 18:48.846
on the other side.

18:48.931 --> 18:51.032
Which is where Walternate
must have built his machine.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.350
There's no other explanation.

18:52.434 --> 18:56.187
But if...

18:56.271 --> 19:01.225
we move our machine
to the same spot as theirs...

19:01.310 --> 19:04.228
We stall the pace
of destruction.

19:04.313 --> 19:08.199
You want to move our machine
100 miles and over water

19:08.283 --> 19:10.985
and park it offshore from
the most densely populated city

19:11.036 --> 19:12.136
in the country?

19:12.204 --> 19:13.571
Yes.

19:13.639 --> 19:14.856
Astrid's already
working out

19:14.923 --> 19:16.791
the logistics
of stable transport.

19:16.858 --> 19:18.709
But when the two machines
are brought together,

19:18.794 --> 19:20.027
won't that increase
the intensity

19:20.078 --> 19:21.229
of events in that spot?

19:21.280 --> 19:22.713
Yes, but it will buy us time.

19:22.781 --> 19:25.099
Olivia's looking for a way
to get Peter inside the machine.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.902
We just have to contain
the damage until she succeeds

19:27.953 --> 19:31.639
and pray that Peter is ready.

19:31.707 --> 19:34.775
Phillip...

19:34.843 --> 19:37.879
I know it sounds crazy...

19:37.946 --> 19:41.549
but it's our only
viable option.

19:45.587 --> 19:47.255
There it is.
The key?

19:47.306 --> 19:49.090
I don't see it.
That's the beauty.

19:49.141 --> 19:51.792
No one can.

19:51.844 --> 19:53.811
Sam?

19:53.896 --> 19:57.849
Do you hear that?

19:57.933 --> 19:59.150
<i>Is it the lights?</i>

19:59.234 --> 20:01.936
It's not the lights.

20:01.987 --> 20:03.988
Get down!

20:07.659 --> 20:09.243
Okay, you get the key.

20:09.311 --> 20:11.979
I'll disable the alarm.

20:30.999 --> 20:32.133
It's not working.

20:32.184 --> 20:34.018
<i>It was short circuited</i>
<i>by the lightning.</i>

20:34.102 --> 20:36.554
<i>We won't make it.</i>

20:42.677 --> 20:45.229
Oh, my God,
Sam.

20:45.314 --> 20:46.480
I work in a bowling alley.

20:46.531 --> 20:48.699
Okay, come on.

20:54.206 --> 20:56.457
That's the key?

20:56.524 --> 20:57.658
Incredible.

20:57.709 --> 20:59.627
Okay, so what do I do?

20:59.694 --> 21:01.695
I don't know.

21:01.747 --> 21:03.965
I told you,
the instructions are incomplete.

21:04.032 --> 21:05.416
I mean, there's nowhere
for it to go.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.635
Are you sure that this
is the right key?

21:07.702 --> 21:08.719
Yeah, are you kidding?

21:08.804 --> 21:09.837
My father took me
to the museum

21:09.888 --> 21:11.088
hundreds of times.

21:11.173 --> 21:15.893
<i>Believe me, you have</i>
<i>no idea how boring those--</i>

21:15.978 --> 21:17.561
You did it.

21:23.218 --> 21:25.353
Sam?

21:29.942 --> 21:30.908
That's the crowbar?

21:30.993 --> 21:33.995
I mean, what is it?

21:47.626 --> 21:49.210
It's you.

21:58.436 --> 22:00.187
What does the drawing mean,
Walter,

22:00.238 --> 22:01.322
and why am I in it?

22:01.389 --> 22:03.524
Well, if it's a companion

22:03.592 --> 22:06.327
to the original picture,

22:06.394 --> 22:08.362
it means that you
and Peter both

22:08.413 --> 22:09.980
have a connection
to the machine.

22:10.048 --> 22:11.448
But why?

22:11.533 --> 22:12.899
I mean, why am I connected
to it?

22:12.951 --> 22:15.586
Perhaps your friend here
could enlighten us.

22:15.670 --> 22:16.737
No.

22:16.788 --> 22:18.405
I mean,
all I know

22:18.473 --> 22:20.240
is the original manuscript
is very clear on this point.

22:20.292 --> 22:21.908
The lockbox contains
the crowbar.

22:21.960 --> 22:25.362
Then the answer
is unavoidable.

22:25.430 --> 22:27.047
Apparently,
you have the ability

22:27.115 --> 22:28.616
to turn off
the force field

22:28.683 --> 22:30.851
that's keeping Peter out
and open the machine

22:30.919 --> 22:32.553
for long enough for him
to get inside.

22:32.604 --> 22:33.871
How am I supposed
to do that?

22:33.938 --> 22:36.607
Well, the answer lies
in the drawing.

22:36.691 --> 22:39.526
Otherwise, why draw it?

22:45.617 --> 22:48.535
Oh, let's see.

22:48.603 --> 22:51.789
Uh-huh.
Brain waves, it would seem.

22:51.873 --> 22:53.774
<i>Hey...</i>

22:53.825 --> 22:55.209
Careful with that.

22:55.276 --> 22:57.127
Uh-huh.

22:59.331 --> 23:01.948
There's your answer.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.617
Huh?

23:03.668 --> 23:05.952
You, Olivia,
have the power

23:06.004 --> 23:07.921
to bend things
with your mind.

23:07.972 --> 23:09.223
That's what you're doing
in this drawing,

23:09.290 --> 23:10.557
if you look at it
the right way.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.259
Walter, you're not seriously
talking about--

23:12.310 --> 23:13.427
telekinesis.
<i>No.</i>

23:13.478 --> 23:14.812
I can't.

23:14.879 --> 23:15.929
<i>Yes, you can.</i>
<i>You've done it before.</i>

23:15.980 --> 23:18.232
Two years ago,
David Robert Jones.

23:18.299 --> 23:20.801
She defused a bomb

23:20.852 --> 23:23.020
<i>by turning off some light</i>
<i>with her mind.</i>

23:23.104 --> 23:24.154
Walter, that was different.

23:24.239 --> 23:26.690
Well, it was less advanced.

23:26.775 --> 23:28.859
Oh, I'm afraid there's
something else.

23:28.943 --> 23:30.861
<i>Since it's the machine</i>
<i>on the other side</i>

23:30.945 --> 23:32.663
<i>that's turned on,</i>

23:32.747 --> 23:35.783
that's the machine
you'll have to interact with.

23:35.834 --> 23:39.503
You're not suggesting
that I need to cross over.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.741
No.

23:43.808 --> 23:45.209
The same part of your mind
that allows you

23:45.293 --> 23:47.895
to cross over contains
your ability of telekinesis.

23:47.962 --> 23:51.532
They should be able to work
together in combination.

23:51.599 --> 23:55.069
Control the machine over there
from over here.

23:55.136 --> 23:56.470
In theory, yes.

23:56.521 --> 23:59.223
No, it's ridiculous,
and even if it was possible,

23:59.307 --> 24:02.242
manipulating a light
is nothing

24:02.310 --> 24:03.727
compared to manipulating
the machine.

24:03.795 --> 24:05.529
You're right.
Of course.

24:05.597 --> 24:10.033
Requires a much greater
degree of control.

24:10.118 --> 24:11.402
We'll have to practice.

24:11.486 --> 24:13.203
Start on something smaller.

24:13.288 --> 24:17.074
How do we do that?

24:17.158 --> 24:18.776
Ahh.

24:21.463 --> 24:24.314
<i>This is the typewriter</i>
<i>the other Olivia used</i>

24:24.382 --> 24:26.049
to communicate
with the other side.

24:26.134 --> 24:28.051
Like the two machines,
it is quantum entangled

24:28.136 --> 24:29.386
with its counterpart.

24:29.471 --> 24:31.388
In this case,
whatever's typed on one

24:31.473 --> 24:32.556
appears on the other,

24:32.640 --> 24:34.892
which makes it
the perfect means

24:34.976 --> 24:36.042
for testing your abilities.

24:36.094 --> 24:37.060
You ready to give it
a try?

24:37.145 --> 24:38.061
So how?

24:38.146 --> 24:39.980
Okay, clear your mind.

24:40.047 --> 24:41.648
Look into the mirror.

24:41.716 --> 24:43.884
Imagine that you're looking
at the typewriter

24:43.935 --> 24:45.018
on the other side.

24:45.069 --> 24:49.323
Now, press those keys
using your mind.

24:56.197 --> 24:57.331
Walter, this is--
shh.

24:57.398 --> 24:58.866
Don't expect it to happen
so quickly.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.751
It's like meditating.

25:00.835 --> 25:03.704
You need to focus
on something specific.

25:03.755 --> 25:07.207
A word, phrase...

25:07.258 --> 25:10.260
And be patient.

25:23.942 --> 25:25.943
Okay.

26:03.014 --> 26:05.649
Walter, maybe if you
gave me some cortexiphan.

26:05.717 --> 26:08.001
I'm afraid at this point,

26:08.069 --> 26:09.636
it would do you more harm
than good.

26:09.687 --> 26:12.155
These abilities
are inside you, Olivia.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.258
You simply need
to harness them.

26:14.325 --> 26:18.779
Walter, I don't know how.

26:18.847 --> 26:21.765
I never have.

26:24.836 --> 26:27.721
I know what it's like
to feel unequal

26:27.789 --> 26:29.239
to the task required
of you.

26:29.307 --> 26:33.660
To feel incapable.

26:33.728 --> 26:37.381
I'll never be
the man I was,

26:37.465 --> 26:39.349
but I've come to embrace
those parts

26:39.434 --> 26:42.168
of my mind that are...

26:42.220 --> 26:45.522
peculiar and broken.

26:45.607 --> 26:51.078
I understand now that's
what makes my mind special.

27:03.224 --> 27:09.046
I wish you could see yourself
the way I see you.

27:09.130 --> 27:13.216
You have no idea how
extraordinary you are.

27:16.838 --> 27:19.189
If you would embrace that,

27:19.257 --> 27:22.626
there's no end
to what you can do.

27:26.014 --> 27:29.349
I know that you want
to believe in me...

27:29.400 --> 27:32.653
and I want to believe
in me...

27:32.720 --> 27:36.356
but believing doesn't
make it true.

27:36.424 --> 27:40.560
Just try.

28:22.603 --> 28:25.489
It's okay.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.708
Take a break
and we'll try again.

28:27.775 --> 28:29.776
Hmm?

28:34.048 --> 28:35.615
The hospital just called.

28:35.667 --> 28:38.285
Peter's missing.

28:58.839 --> 29:01.590
Excuse me.
Do you--

29:01.628 --> 29:02.358
Excuse me.
Hmm?

29:02.360 --> 29:03.994
Do you know if there's
a pawn shop around here?

29:04.045 --> 29:05.195
I've been here before,
but--

29:05.246 --> 29:07.298
No, sorry, man.
I'm--I don't know.

29:07.365 --> 29:08.799
Man, I'm sorry
to disturb you,

29:08.866 --> 29:09.967
but it's just
it's really important.

29:10.034 --> 29:11.051
I could have sworn
there was one.

29:11.136 --> 29:12.252
I don't know.

29:12.337 --> 29:15.306
Uh, I think there's one
over on 3rd Avenue.

29:15.373 --> 29:17.091
On 3rd?

29:17.175 --> 29:18.392
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:18.476 --> 29:20.511
Thank you.

29:54.796 --> 29:56.096
Can I see these?

29:56.181 --> 29:58.766
Sure.

29:58.850 --> 30:01.518
You a collector?

30:01.586 --> 30:05.105
I was...

30:05.190 --> 30:08.425
When I was a kid.

30:08.476 --> 30:09.810
They're all graded
and authenticated.

30:09.894 --> 30:12.446
Price-wise,
everything in here,

30:12.530 --> 30:14.515
500 and up.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.321
This one.

30:21.406 --> 30:22.856
Silver half dollar.

30:22.924 --> 30:24.825
It's my favorite.

30:30.331 --> 30:32.549
It always brings me luck.

30:35.286 --> 30:37.137
Walter, they searched
the house.

30:37.222 --> 30:38.222
There's no sign of him.

30:40.975 --> 30:43.160
What if he can't remember
our address?

30:43.228 --> 30:45.128
No, Walter,
let's not assume the worst.

30:45.180 --> 30:46.730
Is that what you think
I'm doing?

30:46.798 --> 30:49.099
Because it is a fact
that Peter sustained

30:49.150 --> 30:50.317
a massive blow
to the head.

30:50.402 --> 30:52.186
It is a fact
that he was in a hospital

30:52.270 --> 30:53.821
less than 10 hours ago.

30:53.905 --> 30:56.240
It is a fact that we haven't
got the slightest clue

30:56.307 --> 30:57.691
how that machine
affected him.

30:57.776 --> 31:02.246
So please do not accuse me
of making assumptions.

31:09.370 --> 31:10.454
I'm sorry, Astrid.

31:10.505 --> 31:12.873
I know you're scared,
Walter.

31:12.957 --> 31:14.958
Hey.

31:15.009 --> 31:16.460
Peter's credit card
has been used twice

31:16.511 --> 31:18.028
in the past two hours.

31:18.096 --> 31:20.714
$800 to the Western
Massachusetts Cab Company

31:20.799 --> 31:23.517
and $600 to a pawn shop
in Manhattan.

31:23.601 --> 31:26.019
He took a cab to New York?
It appears so.

31:26.104 --> 31:28.272
Until we speak to the driver,
we won't know for sure.

31:28.339 --> 31:30.974
What would he be looking for
in New York?

31:45.323 --> 31:46.490
Excuse me,
you can't be here.

31:46.541 --> 31:47.624
We're evacuating the area.

31:47.692 --> 31:49.042
I know, I know,
but I have to talk to my father.

31:49.127 --> 31:50.244
I have something to show him.

31:50.328 --> 31:51.462
It's really important.

31:51.529 --> 31:52.579
And who, out of curiosity,
is your father?

31:52.664 --> 31:55.666
Walter Bishop.

31:55.717 --> 32:00.137
The Secretary of Defense.

32:00.204 --> 32:02.038
Here.

32:02.090 --> 32:03.223
Thank you.

32:03.308 --> 32:04.925
- Any word from Peter?
- No.

32:05.009 --> 32:06.059
What you doing?

32:06.144 --> 32:07.728
- Reading.
- That's a lie.

32:07.812 --> 32:09.880
Trying to read.

32:09.931 --> 32:13.567
Pathetic attempt to distract
myself with ancient gossip.

32:13.651 --> 32:16.270
Better than thinking about
what I've done.

32:16.354 --> 32:17.988
Sam, you didn't do anything.

32:18.055 --> 32:19.106
I intervened.

32:19.190 --> 32:20.941
I didn't give you
an option not to.

32:21.025 --> 32:22.025
We just got word
Peter's been found.

32:22.076 --> 32:23.660
Is he all right?

32:23.728 --> 32:25.229
<i>He's alert,</i>
<i>answering questions.</i>

32:25.296 --> 32:26.580
<i>Transport's waiting for us</i>
<i>at the heliport.</i>

32:26.664 --> 32:28.165
Well, where is he?
Liberty Island.

32:28.232 --> 32:29.750
The machine has arrived there
as well.

32:29.834 --> 32:30.751
<i>I'll get my coat,</i>

32:30.835 --> 32:33.453
and some dramamine.

32:33.538 --> 32:34.671
I'm afraid this
is where you get off.

32:34.739 --> 32:37.758
<i>Official personnel only.</i>

32:37.842 --> 32:41.077
Sam, whatever's happening,
it's not over.

32:43.548 --> 32:44.965
Good luck, Olivia.

32:45.049 --> 32:47.250
Thank you.

33:04.285 --> 33:05.986
Peter!

33:06.070 --> 33:07.487
What on earth
made you come here?

33:17.949 --> 33:19.917
Are you all right, son?

33:26.057 --> 33:28.425
There are two of you,
aren't there?

33:38.519 --> 33:41.137
I think I've been confused.

33:48.446 --> 33:50.197
What year is it?
2011.

33:50.281 --> 33:51.865
President?

33:51.950 --> 33:55.419
Obama.

33:55.486 --> 33:56.653
Nausea, headaches,
ear-ringing?

33:56.704 --> 33:57.921
No, physically,
I feel fine.

33:57.989 --> 34:00.224
And who is that woman
over there?

34:04.178 --> 34:06.063
Olivia.

34:06.130 --> 34:08.098
<i>What's the last</i>
<i>thing you remembered</i>

34:08.165 --> 34:09.967
before you woke up
in the hospital?

34:10.018 --> 34:12.351
I remember getting
into the machine...

34:12.437 --> 34:13.971
or trying to.

34:14.022 --> 34:17.007
Good.

34:17.058 --> 34:18.859
And do you know me?

34:18.943 --> 34:22.179
I know you're not
the Secretary of Defense.

34:22.246 --> 34:23.447
The sweater's
a dead giveaway.

34:27.018 --> 34:29.735
Good.

34:29.821 --> 34:31.021
Fact that
your memory's returning

34:31.072 --> 34:32.822
is a sign that your confusion
is temporary.

34:32.889 --> 34:35.958
You're gonna be okay, Peter.

34:38.362 --> 34:41.380
Where'd you get this?

34:41.466 --> 34:43.917
Walter?

34:44.002 --> 34:46.036
The machine.

34:52.176 --> 34:54.177
I thought you had a plan
to contain the rise in pressure.

34:54.228 --> 34:57.264
The system wasn't designed
for sudden fluctuations.

34:57.348 --> 34:59.566
So what can we do
to compensate for that?

34:59.651 --> 35:02.769
I'm afraid so long as
the machine is on

35:02.854 --> 35:04.671
there's nothing we can do.

35:11.162 --> 35:14.831
Oh, Peter,
I was worried about you.

35:14.899 --> 35:17.617
I'm okay.

35:17.702 --> 35:19.169
Let's just figure this out.

35:19.236 --> 35:21.621
So the drawing implies that you
need to use telekinesis?

35:21.706 --> 35:22.923
Is Walter sure?

35:23.007 --> 35:25.959
Well, Walter's educated guess
is as good as we have.

35:26.044 --> 35:28.612
Well, I mean, I tried.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.348
I concentrated on a phrase
like Walter asked me to do

35:31.415 --> 35:34.885
and still nothing.

35:34.936 --> 35:37.354
Well, what was the phrase?

36:11.339 --> 36:12.956
What do you mean
it's working?

36:13.007 --> 36:14.524
<i>I heard the keys tapping away.</i>

36:14.592 --> 36:16.159
It keeps typing
the same message.

36:16.227 --> 36:17.677
Are you doing that?

36:17.745 --> 36:19.396
What's the message?

36:19.464 --> 36:22.298
"Be a better man
than your father."

36:29.896 --> 36:31.930
There's a boat leaving
for Manhattan in five minutes!

36:31.981 --> 36:33.732
I want all non-essential
personnel on it!

36:33.799 --> 36:36.735
That means get out now!

36:39.989 --> 36:42.441
Don't worry.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.910
Just think of it as
a giant typewriter.

36:44.977 --> 36:46.161
Do you know what to do?

36:46.246 --> 36:48.780
I think so.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.282
The tremors
are getting stronger.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.950
Exponential microquakes.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.453
We're building towards
a massive event.

36:54.504 --> 36:56.321
I suspect we don't have
much time left.

36:56.372 --> 36:58.257
Walter, what if I
can't do it?

36:58.324 --> 37:00.659
What if I can't
turn it off?

37:00.710 --> 37:02.928
I have known you
for a long time, Olivia,

37:02.995 --> 37:06.582
and I believe that
the drawing was no accident.

37:06.649 --> 37:11.002
Whoever did it knew the same
as I do.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.338
That you don't fail.

37:35.395 --> 37:37.162
You ready?

37:37.213 --> 37:40.332
No.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.218
You?

37:43.303 --> 37:45.187
No.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.234
Don't say I never
took you anywhere.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.928
You can do this.

39:18.297 --> 39:19.798
Notify the Secretary.

39:19.849 --> 39:21.867
There's something happening
to the machine.

39:26.989 --> 39:29.991
You did it.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.531
Peter.

39:41.037 --> 39:42.987
I love you.

39:55.668 --> 39:59.805
Wish me luck.

40:51.073 --> 40:52.223
Oh, dear God.

41:43.275 --> 41:48.780
<i>All civilians proceed to</i>
<i>evacuation route immediately.</i>

42:11.654 --> 42:14.973
Agent Bishop.

42:15.024 --> 42:16.608
Agent Bishop,
take cover!

42:21.330 --> 42:23.331
Fringe Division?

42:25.451 --> 42:26.985
Where the hell am I?

42:27.036 --> 42:28.319
Sir, you've been hit.

42:28.371 --> 42:31.122
Medic!
I need a medic now!
