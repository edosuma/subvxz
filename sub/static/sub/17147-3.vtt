02:07.461 --> 02:09.838
I wonder what Danny got you.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.924
It could be anything.

This was another fake out.

Wow, I've never been on the moon before.

Tourin' secret labs on the moon is my jam.

been here before. Good old, uh, uh...

Hmm. Bay 2.

I made it up on the spot.

Aw, you're the best, Fyootch. Huh?

04:56.922 --> 04:59.007
But why is there so much
animal hair on the floor?

04:59.091 --> 05:02.052
Shouldn't secret moonbase
chem labs have strict pet policies?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.595
All that matters is you love it, right?

-We're not?
-No, I cleared it with the guys in Bay 2.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.460
Yup, Bay 2. Cleared.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.796

18:39.786 --> 18:41.330
<i>except for me.</i>

18:41.413 --> 18:44.416
<i>I do very important things</i>
<i>to help people all by myself,</i>

18:45.042 --> 18:46.293
<i>and there's also helper-people</i>

18:46.376 --> 18:48.462
<i>who pilot the spaceship</i>
<i>and whatnot, whatever...</i>

18:48.545 --> 18:49.880
<i>Well, you know... It's my show.</i>

18:49.963 --> 18:53.509
(READING)

18:54.259 --> 18:56.970
(LAUGHS) I'm terrific at building robots.

18:57.054 --> 18:58.305
-(ALARM BLARING)
-We're receiving

18:58.388 --> 19:00.015
a distress signal from the away team.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.934
Is it related with me building robots?

19:02.017 --> 19:05.062
<i>A pack of titan elephoids</i>
<i>ambushed us on Grizmont 5.</i>

19:05.145 --> 19:07.898
I'm too busy building robots
to deal with this.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.068
Rhonda, aim turbo-peedos
at Planet Grizmont 5.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.194
Let's wipe 'em all out.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.570
Arming turbo-peedos.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.030
<i>That usually works, Steak,</i>

19:15.113 --> 19:16.657
<i>but this time, there's no need.</i>

19:16.740 --> 19:18.659
<i>We've got the matter under control.</i>

19:18.742 --> 19:20.244
Disarming turbo-peedos.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.330
What? They have it under control, do they?

19:23.413 --> 19:24.748
I sincerely doubt it.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.252
(SIGHS) So, you didn't need

19:28.335 --> 19:29.837
-my help after all.
-Nope.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.006
We were able to trap them in energy cages
of my own design.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.508
I'm ashamed I doubted you.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.176
I am... I'm a terrible leader...

19:36.260 --> 19:37.261
-(ROARS)
-Steak!

19:37.344 --> 19:38.345
-No, Steak.
-Oh, no.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.429
-(TRUMPETS)
-(EXCLAIMS)

19:39.513 --> 19:42.641
What just happened?
We should've listened to Steak.

19:42.724 --> 19:43.809
-Correct.
-(GASPS)

19:43.892 --> 19:45.394
You should have listened to Steak.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.312
That's right, I'm alive.

19:47.396 --> 19:50.274
The person you saw die
was not Steak Starbolt.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.984
It was a robot I built.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.193
Wow.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.611
I'm terrific at building robots.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.947
(SIGHS) I'm relieved you're okay, Steak.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.156
That was a crazy trick.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.241
Trick? (CHUCKLES)

19:59.324 --> 20:00.701
It was more of a lesson.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.578
I guess, my point didn't come through.
You see...

20:03.036 --> 20:04.037
Steak!

20:04.121 --> 20:05.122
(TRUMPETS)

20:05.455 --> 20:06.707
(CRIES)

20:06.790 --> 20:08.959
-(ALL GASP)
-Yes, very shocking.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.212
That was another robot I built.
Have you learned your lesson yet?

20:12.296 --> 20:15.048
Yes, yes, got the lesson.
Please don't do that again.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.842
-Lesson learned got it.
-Got it.

20:17.176 --> 20:18.844
Good, because I'm all out of robots.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.554
Now, let's get back to the ship and...

20:20.637 --> 20:21.930
-(ALL EXCLAIM)
-Oh, no.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.390
Steak!

20:23.473 --> 20:25.184
-(SCREAMS)
-(ELEPHOID TRUMPETS)

20:25.267 --> 20:27.019
-Oh, no!
-(ROARS)

20:27.102 --> 20:28.270
Steak.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.189
Steak? Is this just another lesson?

20:30.272 --> 20:33.192
Okay, we got it now.
You can come out, Steak.

20:33.734 --> 20:34.776
Steak?

20:35.986 --> 20:37.279
(ALL SOBBING)

20:37.362 --> 20:39.198
WOMAN: (SOBBING) Why, Steak?

20:39.281 --> 20:41.491
(ALL SOBBING)

20:44.828 --> 20:47.873
(IN FEMALE VOICE) He was too beautiful
for our world, wasn't he?

20:47.956 --> 20:50.125
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

20:51.126 --> 20:54.505
He was so handsome and young.

21:00.719 --> 21:01.929
(DISTANT WHISTLE)

21:02.012 --> 21:04.264
We... We missed somebody.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.560
(BIKE ENGINE STARTS)

21:10.729 --> 21:12.064
(EXCLAIMS AND LAUGHS)

21:12.147 --> 21:14.525
It's... It's Steak Starbolt.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.568
He'll never make it.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.822
-Steak.
-(LAUGHS) I'm Steak Starbolt.

21:20.906 --> 21:24.243
-Hoorah.
-(LAUGHING)

21:24.326 --> 21:26.370
Whoo. Steak Starbolt.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.163
-I'm Steak Starbolt!
-Oh, Steak.

21:28.247 --> 21:31.124
That's right, I'm not dead.
Did you learn your lesson?

21:31.208 --> 21:32.459
Yes, we did.

21:32.543 --> 21:34.211
-Never to trust you again.
-What?
