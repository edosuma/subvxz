ROSE:
Monroe?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.593
Monroe?

01:32.660 --> 01:34.728
(thunder rumbles)

01:37.531 --> 01:40.768
Maybe I should have brought you
a sofa instead.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.606
Did Celia get on her train?

01:45.673 --> 01:46.907
Yep.

01:46.974 --> 01:50.811
On her way to freshman year.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.915
It was kind of her to
stay for the funeral.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.751
Oh, she loved Minna.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.554
We all did.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.356
(sighs)

02:03.224 --> 02:05.893
Dumb question:

02:05.959 --> 02:08.295
how are you?

02:10.130 --> 02:13.567
Okay.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.803
Honesty's good.

02:19.207 --> 02:23.677
I know everything
seems scary now.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.348
That'll change.
You'll even love again.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.816
(Stahr scoffs)

02:33.086 --> 02:35.889
(quietly):
I promise.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.693
I'm no good with plants.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.665
I'll drop by now and then,
see that it's tended to.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.370
I need something to take care of
at the moment.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.775
I'm sure Pat would disagree.

02:57.044 --> 03:00.648
I'm sure Pat wouldn't notice.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.650
* *

03:22.035 --> 03:24.238
(thunder rumbles)

03:31.078 --> 03:32.746
(thunder rumbles)

03:36.650 --> 03:38.786
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

03:40.220 --> 03:41.389
(clears throat)

03:41.455 --> 03:43.757
Well, she seemed
pleasant enough.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.959
She is, I suppose.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.629
And not a bad roommate.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.599
But the next sentence she starts

03:51.665 --> 03:54.368
without the word "I"
will be the first.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.136
(chuckles)

03:56.203 --> 03:58.872
"I'm getting a part in this.
I'm getting the lead in that."

03:58.939 --> 04:00.841
Can't blame her
for being aspirational.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.943
We're all aspirational,
Mr. Stahr.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.645
Thing about actresses is:
they think

04:04.712 --> 04:06.880
you're as interested
in their lives as they are.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.550
It's bop-bop-bop,
like a metronome.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.752
You could be on screen.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.288
Oh. Turn into that?
Rather drown.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.324
Well, then, why'd you come here?

04:16.390 --> 04:18.459
All the way from Rathgar.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.028
To be an actress.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.863
Perfect.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.298
(laughs)

04:24.365 --> 04:27.435
Took me about a month
before I started hating

04:27.501 --> 04:31.138
the person I was becoming.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.475
(scoffs)
So I quit.

04:34.542 --> 04:38.011
Self-respect still counts
for something, doesn't it?

04:38.078 --> 04:41.248
Quite a bit.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.883
I hated auditioning.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.284
Funny.

04:44.352 --> 04:47.187
I'm not minding it at all.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.822
(chuckles)

04:48.889 --> 04:50.290
Kathleen Moore.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.559
(laughs)

04:51.625 --> 04:53.427
BRADY:
I heard a joke today.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.398
ROSE:
Oh, yeah?

04:57.465 --> 04:58.932
-You're on an elevator.
-(shower turns off)

04:58.999 --> 05:02.169
The doors open.
Suddenly, in walks Hitler,

05:02.235 --> 05:04.472
Mussolini, and Louis B. Mayer.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.374
You've got a gun
with two bullets in it.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.008
What do you do?

05:08.075 --> 05:09.242
I don't know, what?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.511
Easy.

05:10.578 --> 05:13.914
(laughs):
You shoot Mayer twice.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.285
I hope that dinner wasn't
completely intolerable

05:18.352 --> 05:19.987
for you tonight, dear.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.522
Thought the ladies had a couple

05:21.589 --> 05:25.325
of fine suggestions for you:
bridge, mahjongg.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.060
Maybe join one of
the charities in town,

05:27.127 --> 05:29.229
organize one of those dinners.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.330
-Jack Warner's wife...
-(sighs)

05:30.398 --> 05:32.332
...seems to find that
very fulfilling.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.069
Hmm, Jack Warner's wife
is a cunt.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.672
They all are.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.775
It should be illegal
to be that smug.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.811
(sighs)

05:49.316 --> 05:53.421
I wish I could... write.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.790
Or paint.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.959
I'm glad to hell you can't.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.164
HACKETT: He's got
a twisted sense of humor,

06:04.231 --> 06:05.433
that Monroe.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.935
It was the only office
available.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.537
HACKETT:
You shouldn't be in an office.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.871
You should be in a dormitory,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.673
-reading Shakespeare.
-(sighs)

06:12.740 --> 06:13.774
Lucky for you I'm not.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.509
I did come up
with a title tonight:

06:15.576 --> 06:16.944
An Enemy Among Us.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.211
Titles are easy.

06:18.278 --> 06:21.682
Let's not forget,
I handed you the whole story.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.084
You gave me a plot.
They're not the same thing.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.853
-No?
-No.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.255
Plot: the queen died
and the king died.

06:28.321 --> 06:33.494
Story: the queen died and
the king died... of grief.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.696
See, I don't blame you
for being a kid, Celia,

06:35.763 --> 06:38.131
but you ought at least fess up
to how little you know.

06:38.198 --> 06:42.169
I know plenty.
I grew up in the pictures.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.973
You grew up at premieres,
also not the same thing.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.909
Aubrey, I'm practically
producing this one.

06:48.976 --> 06:52.480
That makes me your boss,
technically.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.114
Oh, my God.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.884
For a second there, I saw my
future flashing before my eyes.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.786
And the name "Brady"
was still on the gates,

06:58.852 --> 07:00.420
but you were the "Brady."

07:00.488 --> 07:01.855
Well, when that happens,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.257
do you want to be the writer
I owe it all to?

07:04.324 --> 07:07.127
Or the one who kept saying
I didn't know anything?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.510
Pretty picture.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.244
Are you seeing anyone else
at the moment?

07:24.311 --> 07:28.682
Uh, no. Why?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.651
Self-preservation.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.753
Does anyone out there
think she's seeing you?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.555
No. Are you seeing anyone?

07:34.622 --> 07:36.557
-No.
-Were you seeing Dex?

07:36.624 --> 07:38.792
My goodness, he was married.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.695
Mm, just the way
he looked at you.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.431
I...
(scoffs)

07:44.498 --> 07:46.466
disloyal people
don't appeal top me.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.803
There was one night,
around closing,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.839
I thought he might kiss me.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.608
Well, it seemed
like he wanted to.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.712
What you're doing right now
is called a cliffhanger.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.181
-Please stop.
-(laughs)

08:01.248 --> 08:02.916
He said,

08:02.983 --> 08:07.187
"I like you too much
to inflict myself on you."

08:08.956 --> 08:09.990
Kathleen,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.593
-I wonder if I...
-Yes, you big Hollywood phony.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.828
(both laugh)

08:17.464 --> 08:20.167
I'd like to kiss you
at some point.

08:20.233 --> 08:24.471
In a picture, if a girl let a
boy kiss her on the first date,

08:24.538 --> 08:26.006
you'd think she was easy.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.375
Or in love.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.777
Well, I'm neither.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.611
Hmm.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.078
But you could come in

08:32.145 --> 08:35.482
and try your luck with my
roommate, the actress.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.350
She'd kiss you.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.219
And I doubt she'd stop there.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.419
No good.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.222
Has to be you.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.291
Oh, that's lovely, thank you.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.702
What was that you were saying
about cliffhangers?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.711
Good night, Monroe.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.320
Good night.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.989
(door creaks open, closes)

09:21.995 --> 09:23.096
It's 9:05.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.531
And?

09:24.598 --> 09:26.900
Tuesdays at 9:00?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.203
Good to see you
thinking Oscar, Pat.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.238
What color is it?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.241
(sighs)
Gold.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.909
Thought it was green.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.645
Is it true
you gave Celia an office?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.947
Would you prefer
she sit on Aubrey's lap?

09:41.448 --> 09:43.316
I prefer she not be there.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.852
I prefer Brinel went away.

09:44.918 --> 09:45.953
-(spoon clinks)
-Nice try, Pat.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.420
-Hmm.
-But you already gave me

09:47.487 --> 09:48.622
that blank check, remember?

09:48.689 --> 09:51.591
Guess I did, softie that I am.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.560
(footfalls approaching)

09:53.627 --> 09:55.629
Hello, boys.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.430
Conquering the known world?

09:57.497 --> 09:59.132
That's Celia's job.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.201
We're just trying
to make a living.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.803
That's sweet.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.604
You will look after her,
won't you, Monroe?

10:04.672 --> 10:06.774
See that she's
not corrupted?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.810
I have a feeling she'll be fine.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.680
Let's hope so.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.015
So, is the studio doing
anything for Minna?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.119
Two years ago next week.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.389
Might be nice to have
an official remembrance.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.892
I guess we will.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.928
Good. You two have fun now.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.266
She'll be there tonight?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.969
Not likely.
She hates previews.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.072
-Next.
-Next.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.041
Mayer.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.276
He's not gonna loan you
Bess Burrows for another picture

10:43.343 --> 10:44.477
without a good reason.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.479
Why not? I'm an affable guy.

10:46.546 --> 10:50.718
(chuckles) You have to tell him
why only Bess can play the role,

10:50.784 --> 10:52.452
and why the picture
matters to you.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.486
Pretentious prick.

10:53.553 --> 10:57.324
He'll try to unsettle you
by complimenting me.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.160
For some reason, people
around town think you hate that.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.295
People around town
can kiss my ass.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.530
(laughs)

11:03.596 --> 11:05.065
Let's not mythologize him,
Monroe.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.367
I bluffed him into the ground
with a pair of sevens

11:07.434 --> 11:08.802
in our game last week.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.838
In the end, he's still just
the Yid from Minsk

11:10.904 --> 11:12.940
the bigger kids picked on.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.075
That doesn't go away, you watch.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.280
He doesn't think
you're a movie man, Pat.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.817
When Bells comes out,
he'll know better.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.053
Everybody will. Even you.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.088
Must be killing you,

11:28.155 --> 11:29.656
having a picture
come out of here

11:29.723 --> 11:31.725
without your fingerprints on it.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.427
The Bells of Boston,
produced by me,

11:34.494 --> 11:36.096
movie man.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.299
Without my boy genius even
seeing a single daily.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.870
You ought to compliment
his horse.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.839
Mayer.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.741
His filly just won
a stakes race at Saratoga.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.442
He fancies himself
a breeder now.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.779
I know about his stupid horse.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.347
And I don't need
your help with Mayer.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.383
* *

12:07.427 --> 12:10.263
MAN: Quiet on rehearsal.
Props, we need props, please.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.599
SUSAN: Mr. Mayer apologizes
for the wait, Mr. Brady.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.168
You know how involved
he gets with screen tests.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.470
Oh, that's quite
all right, Susan.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.472
It's good to see you again.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.908
How you been?

12:20.974 --> 12:23.043
Just fine, Mr. Brady.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.878
Mr. Mayer been
treating you okay?

12:24.945 --> 12:27.781
Like a lady.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.483
How's that poodle of yours?

12:30.550 --> 12:31.819
The one with the funny name.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.720
Pancakes?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.188
Muffin.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.323
Yeah.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.757
He died.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.726
-MAN: Go. Get out of there.
-Huh.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.261
Sorry to hear that.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.496
(stage bell rings)

12:43.563 --> 12:44.631
Morning, L.B.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.466
-Shh! -MAN: Could you grab me
an ashtray, doll?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.534
MAN 2:
Final touches!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.469
MAN 3: Bring it down
another six inches.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.704
MAN: That's perfect, thank you.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.273
Oh, that, there. That's perfect.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.375
Let's bring in Gable.
We'll shoot the test now.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.309
(stage bell rings)

12:56.376 --> 12:57.710
ASSISTANT:
First team on set, please.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.312
Oh, finally.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.082
Fifth goddamn actress that
we have tested for this part.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.383
Looks like a real find.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.052
Oh, yeah. How's Monroe?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.387
-Fine. -Impressive piece
of manpower you got there.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.489
(chuckles)
Expensive piece of manpower,

13:09.556 --> 13:11.424
-but what am I gonna do, huh?
-(chuckles)

13:11.491 --> 13:12.525
Ars gratia artis, right?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.027
It's a shame we couldn't
meet in my office.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.528
I would love for you to see it.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.297
-Is it true you had it
all done in white? -Yeah.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.432
White drapes, white phone,
even white carpet.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.968
White carpet. My, my.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.535
(chuckles): You got
a lot of faith in your guests.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.371
Well, most of them
come in on their knees,

13:24.437 --> 13:27.274
so what do I care what they got
on the bottom of their shoes?

13:27.340 --> 13:28.308
Am I right?

13:28.375 --> 13:29.742
To what do I owe
the pleasure, Pat?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.478
I need a favor.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.413
I want you to give me
Bess Burrows

13:33.480 --> 13:34.547
for another picture.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.084
Our agreement was for two:

13:37.150 --> 13:39.119
Bells of Boston
and your Minna Davis picture.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.988
I really need her
for my new musical, L.B.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.489
I want her to play
Sally Sweet's aunt.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.457
Wish I could help you,
but she's not available.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.626
Her agent says you got nothing
special lined up for her.

13:46.693 --> 13:50.297
Well, her agent is an idiot.
Got her whole career mapped out,

13:50.363 --> 13:51.664
starting with a picture
called Boys Town.

13:51.731 --> 13:52.866
Shoots next month.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.001
-Boys Town?
-Mm-hmm.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.068
What's she playing?

13:55.135 --> 13:58.005
Oh, she's playing a nun.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.008
Perfect nun.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.245
So, you see, I got to be
very careful with her image.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.914
I don't even let her date, Pat.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.049
I didn't realize
it was personal for you.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.283
-Yeah.
-Truth is...

14:11.518 --> 14:13.353
it's kind of personal
for me, too, Louis.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.088
Oh? How?

14:15.155 --> 14:19.026
She's desperate to
play this part, the sweet kid.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.996
And I gave her my word
that you'd let it happen.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.998
-(chuckles)
-And then...

14:25.065 --> 14:27.667
then I fucked her lights out
on my carpet, twice.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.536
Lucky for me, it isn't white.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.941
Ah, I see.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.176
Guess I did you a favor
when you think about it.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.412
'Cause I got to tell you,
that girl...

14:39.479 --> 14:41.448
is no nun.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.016
Thanks, Louis.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.066
(bicycle bell dings)

15:06.839 --> 15:09.309
Oh. Beg your pardon.
Clumsy me.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.379
SZEP:
Nice entrance.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.684
Sorry.
(sighs)

15:17.750 --> 15:20.553
Do you know where
I could find a, uh...

15:20.620 --> 15:22.089
a M-Mr. Szep?

15:22.155 --> 15:24.724
Mr. Brady sent me about a job.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.460
-My name's Max Miner.
-Yeah.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.695
The Okie.

15:30.797 --> 15:31.999
I'm Szep.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.401
That your only suit?

15:34.467 --> 15:37.037
Of course it is.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.906
Go see Mr. Greeves in Traffic.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.341
Uh, sir?

15:41.408 --> 15:44.177
I'd like to get
my brother and sister

15:44.244 --> 15:46.646
out of the park we been in.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.682
Are there any salary
lenders around here?

15:50.750 --> 15:53.686
How in hell should I know?

15:57.790 --> 15:58.791
KAY:
What's wrong, Landon?

15:58.858 --> 16:00.227
HACKETT:
Don't ask.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.595
Stahr put him on
The Swords of Alsace-Lorraine.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.964
Oh.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.133
-Sorry.
-(paper crumples)

16:06.199 --> 16:08.135
Aubrey says I'm the
eighth writer on it.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.937
That's true. I was the third.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.472
Also the sixth.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.041
(scoffs)

16:14.107 --> 16:16.709
Oh, God. Stahr approaching!

16:18.311 --> 16:19.246
(typing)

16:23.150 --> 16:25.252
Oh, taking another break,
Aubrey?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.187
Thinking is writing, too,
Monroe.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.721
Typing is writing.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.758
Without this picture,
we're gonna be "the studio

16:31.824 --> 16:34.027
that brought you Sally Sweet."
Is that what you want?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.162
It's formulating in my brain.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.329
It is, Monroe.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.630
Well, put your brain aside.

16:37.697 --> 16:38.765
This picture's about rage.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.233
You...

16:40.300 --> 16:42.869
(softly): You have to write it
with your prick. Right?

16:42.935 --> 16:44.237
Wouldn't he have
more typos that way?

16:46.206 --> 16:47.740
Crack the whip on him, Celia.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.043
Please.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.411
Such a hurry.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.812
Well, I can't shoot
a blank page, pal.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.647
(typing continues)

16:58.051 --> 16:59.186
How's it coming, Landon?

16:59.252 --> 17:00.853
Beautifully, thanks.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.056
Is that right?

17:06.792 --> 17:08.961
Huh. I guess typing

17:09.028 --> 17:10.297
isn't always writing.

17:11.763 --> 17:12.865
How'd you know?

17:12.932 --> 17:13.733
Even from outside, you can hear

17:13.800 --> 17:15.301
if someone
never hits the space bar.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.238
Jesus.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.707
(door opens)

17:22.909 --> 17:24.810
(typing continues)

17:28.748 --> 17:29.782
MAN:
This way.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.289
CELIA:
Monroe.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.293
Wherefore art thou?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.429
Do you think I belong here?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.831
I think you'll be
running the place before long.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.700
Well, I think I'll do my job
more effectively

17:47.767 --> 17:51.104
if everyone stops treating me
like a kid, especially you.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.341
Being a kid is
a wonderful thing, Celia.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.110
Second it's over,
you start wishing

17:57.177 --> 17:58.378
you could have it back again.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.813
But kids don't get
their movies made, do they?

18:00.880 --> 18:03.049
And they aren't taken seriously
by their writers.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.385
That's true.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.721
I apologize.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.357
Thank you.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.396
How's Kathleen?

18:18.531 --> 18:22.569
Sort of question a kid
would ask, don't you think?

18:26.206 --> 18:27.840
(softly):
"How's Kathleen?"

18:29.409 --> 18:32.845
"A nun," he says.
(chuckles)

18:32.912 --> 18:34.347
"A perfect nun."

18:34.414 --> 18:36.916
Poor little prick.
I almost felt sorry for him.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.418
Almost.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.553
(laughs) Yeah, you know,
if I'd actually slept with her,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.455
I'm not sure I could
have pulled it off.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.158
My guess is you could have.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.059
My guess is you're right.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.695
-(both chuckle)
-(knock on door)

18:50.197 --> 18:51.564
Beg your pardon, Mr. Brady.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.832
Yes, Mary?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.167
Mr. Stahr's off the lot

18:54.234 --> 18:55.602
and Corny Riddle's office
just called.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.969
Well?

18:57.036 --> 18:59.105
He's flying in this evening,
has asked to meet with you

18:59.172 --> 19:00.807
and Mr. Stahr at 10:30 tonight,

19:00.873 --> 19:02.108
after the preview.

19:02.175 --> 19:05.077
Just him?
Nobody else from the board?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.180
No, sir.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.949
That'll be fine, Mary,
of course.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.651
Thank you.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.389
Find out what you can.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.695
Good evening, Mr. Stahr.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.331
-Thanks, Ned.
-My pleasure.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.600
Well, it does have its perks.
The parking space alone.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.036
Yeah, well, the ones who
are in it for the perks

19:30.102 --> 19:31.137
don't last very long.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.805
(chuckles):
Oh...

19:34.341 --> 19:35.742
CALDY:
This poster, Monroe.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.645
I am the picture's producer
and my name is so small.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.015
I'll get marketing
right on that.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.017
Good to see you,
too, Caldy.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.719
Break a leg tonight, E.B.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.322
There he is.
Evening, Pat.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.492
Monroe.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.560
This is Kathleen Moore.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.194
-Miss Moore.
-Mr. Brady.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.131
-Hello.
-Hello.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.132
Evening, Monroe.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.034
Rose.

20:02.101 --> 20:05.372
Miss Moore, have I seen you
in something recently?

20:05.438 --> 20:08.140
Yes, I once played a waitress

20:08.207 --> 20:09.742
who handed you
a tuna fish sandwich.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.379
(chuckles) Miss Moore's
not an actress, Pat.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.381
Oh? Why the hell not?

20:14.447 --> 20:16.783
It's been done.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.286
(laughs)

20:19.352 --> 20:21.388
I am glad he found you,
Miss Moore.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.256
I've missed the sound
of Ireland around here.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.857
Oh, we all have.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.594
(laughs):
Well...

20:27.660 --> 20:32.932
Rose, dear, would you please
show Miss Moore to her seat?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.301
Something I have to discuss

20:34.367 --> 20:36.369
-with Monroe.
-ROSE: Of course.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.004
Your first preview?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.839
Yes.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.207
You're in for a treat.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.609
It's like surgery,

20:42.675 --> 20:44.477
but without the anesthetic.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.816
Corny Riddle wants to see us
in my office at 10:30 tonight.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.017
He's flying in.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.184
Why?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.620
I don't know.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.888
Maybe we should ask that
pinheaded son of his.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.858
CLINT:
I love it, I love it, I love it.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.060
STAHR:
Hello, Clint. Hello, Bess.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.429
-Hey, Monroe.
-Monroe.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.030
-Mr. Brady.
-Mm-hmm.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.833
After tonight, you're gonna
have two new stars, Monroe.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.803
Pat, how did you ever talk
Mayer into letting her go?

21:10.870 --> 21:13.840
I just charmed
the pants off him.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.142
(gasps) Lucky me.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.243
-(giggles)
-Caldy, may we

21:17.310 --> 21:18.645
speak with you for a moment?

21:18.711 --> 21:20.980
Yeah, sure.
I'll see you inside, you two.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.515
Yeah.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.788
Look, you louse, why is
your father flying here?

21:28.855 --> 21:31.324
Uh...

21:31.391 --> 21:33.225
There's a lot he doesn't
discuss with me.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.494
What does he discuss with you?

21:34.561 --> 21:36.529
That these are troubled times

21:36.596 --> 21:39.332
and banks are fickle things.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.733
What the hell does that mean?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.302
It means you two should
really be nicer to me.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.673
I could wind up
owning this place.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.875
And sooner than you think.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.178
Are you ready, Mr. Brady?

21:52.244 --> 21:56.148
Yeah. We're coming, thanks.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.784
Let's just enjoy the show.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.064
So, what are we seeing?

22:12.131 --> 22:14.467
The Bells of Boston.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.436
Gonna be the biggest hit
we've ever had.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.270
How can you know?

22:18.337 --> 22:21.340
Because it has to be.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.676
(projector clicking)

22:23.743 --> 22:25.945
(instrumental theme music
playing)

22:46.399 --> 22:47.734
Hal, what happened?

22:47.800 --> 22:48.935
HAL:
Just some brass knuckles

22:49.001 --> 22:51.571
on two of Harry Cohn's
thugs last night.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.807
Celia, close the door.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.243
Ah, Jesus!

22:57.309 --> 22:58.911
All the drivers
are meeting tonight.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.780
-I was just leaving you
the address. -Hey,

23:00.847 --> 23:02.515
-I'll be there.
-Aubrey, what's all this about?

23:02.582 --> 23:06.453
Oh, this is Hal Sykes.
Drives trucks.

23:06.519 --> 23:09.021
And this is what happens
when a guys says "union"

23:09.088 --> 23:10.389
too loudly at a studio.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.959
Studios don't do that.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.060
(scoffs)

23:14.126 --> 23:16.929
This is Celia... Brady.

23:18.364 --> 23:19.499
She'll be there, too.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.367
BESS (on screen):
Can we take a streetcar?

23:21.434 --> 23:24.571
I wish we could, Madge.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.706
Maybe they'd let us on for free.

23:26.773 --> 23:29.742
It is almost Christmas.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.645
Streetcars don't know what
time of year it is, honey.

23:32.712 --> 23:36.483
-Oh... -And it's just
a few more blocks.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.651
-CLINT: Mr. Carter?
-(man coughs)

23:38.718 --> 23:40.319
(woman clears throat)

23:40.386 --> 23:43.022
Winfield Carter?

23:43.089 --> 23:45.492
I'm... I'm Bell.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.460
(woman clears throat)

23:47.527 --> 23:49.095
-William Bell.
-(woman laughs)

23:49.161 --> 23:50.763
I used to work in your factory.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.499
(yawns)

23:52.565 --> 23:54.000
Madge, it's Mr. Carter.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.102
MAN:
No, I'm afraid I'm just someone

23:56.168 --> 23:58.004
who used to be Winfield Carter.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.171
It's not so bad.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.007
Yes, it is.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.675
CLINT: I would know that
generous countenance anywhere.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.577
Do you remember
my daughter Madge?

24:04.644 --> 24:07.547
You were always
so kind to her...

24:07.614 --> 24:10.016
Imbecile fucking director.
I should have fired you.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.618
I'll be right back.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.219
Gosh, Mr. Carter, you are about

24:13.285 --> 24:14.987
the nicest factory owner...

24:15.054 --> 24:18.090
CELIA: I'm not sure
I should be here, Aubrey.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.227
I mean, I promised my father
I'd go to his preview tonight.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.830
Celia, without the people
you're about to meet,

24:23.896 --> 24:26.165
your father wouldn't have
any previews.

24:26.232 --> 24:29.201
(overlapping chatter)

24:34.140 --> 24:35.107
Let's get started.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.180
Jesus Christ, Dell.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.215
It's got no life at all.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.216
I know.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.786
Is that a continuity?

24:46.853 --> 24:48.855
-That close-up of Clint
in the dinner scene. -Look...

24:48.921 --> 24:50.923
Didn't you have any takes
where he wasn't so awful?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.725
That was his best, by a mile.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.627
Well, couldn't you play
the scene off of Bess?

24:54.694 --> 24:55.762
Or Carter?

24:55.828 --> 24:57.797
Could play the scene off
the ashtray if you'd like,

24:57.864 --> 24:59.065
but Clint's doing the talking.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.867
We'd have to cut
to him eventually.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.836
He just...

25:03.903 --> 25:05.037
Monroe?

25:05.104 --> 25:07.439
I'm considering
the ashtray idea.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.841
CLINT:
Wow.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.343
This ought to fit the bill.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.146
Madge, you could take it in
a little bit, can't you?

25:14.213 --> 25:15.181
(gags)

25:15.247 --> 25:17.584
The sleeves look a little long.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.185
BESS:
I sure could.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.286
CARTER:
For whom?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.754
CLINT:
For you.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.790
BESS: You look to be
a 42 regular, Mr. Carter.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.057
Is that about right?

25:25.124 --> 25:27.927
CARTER: Hmm. I'm afraid
I don't understand.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.863
Why would you give me
a new suit?

25:30.930 --> 25:33.833
CLINT: How else are we
to reclaim your empire?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.868
CLUB BUTLER: Welcome back
to the Harvard Club, Mr. Carter.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.904
CARTER:
Thank you, Jasper.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.572
Hello, gents.
Good to see you all.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.874
MAN:
Carter. Carter! Is that you?

25:41.941 --> 25:43.075
Where the devil have you been?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.611
CARTER:
South America, mostly.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.846
It's a wonder
what some raw materials

25:46.913 --> 25:48.781
can do to reclaim
a lost fortune.

25:48.848 --> 25:52.585
Why? 'Cause in America, the rich
only care about one thing:

25:52.652 --> 25:54.020
getting richer.

25:54.086 --> 25:57.624
-MAN: He's right. -Crazy me,
I figured a guy as rich

25:57.690 --> 25:59.258
as Harry Cohn--
yeah, I will say it out loud--

25:59.325 --> 26:03.329
would be decent enough
to help his injured employees.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.064
-MAN: Yeah.
-MAN 2: Yeah.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.133
SYKES:
And I said the word

26:07.199 --> 26:09.936
the bigwigs all hate...

26:10.002 --> 26:12.204
-"union."
-MAN: Yeah. Here we go.

26:12.271 --> 26:16.075
So, he sent his goons out
to rearrange my face a little.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.378
'Cause he figures
that'll scare us all off.

26:19.445 --> 26:20.747
Bastards.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.115
(glass shatters)

26:23.182 --> 26:24.483
Son of a bitch.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.686
(men grunting)

26:26.753 --> 26:27.887
(glass shatters)

26:34.393 --> 26:35.361
MAN:
Let's go, let's go!

26:35.427 --> 26:36.562
Come on, let's go!

26:36.629 --> 26:38.030
MAN 2:
You heard him, let's go!

26:38.097 --> 26:39.265
Get a move on!

26:42.368 --> 26:44.637
Come on, come on, come on.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.505
(yells)

26:46.572 --> 26:48.340
(overlapping chatter)

26:48.407 --> 26:50.743
MAN: Hey, get us out of here.
Let's go. Let's go.

26:51.644 --> 26:52.812
(yells)

26:52.879 --> 26:54.714
You got something against
peaceable meetings, buddy?

26:54.781 --> 26:57.183
For filthy Reds, yeah.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.487
-MAN: There you go!
-MAN 2: Yeah!

27:01.553 --> 27:02.855
MAN:
That'll teach him!

27:07.026 --> 27:08.194
(yells)

27:08.260 --> 27:09.361
(gasps)

27:11.731 --> 27:12.699
MAN:
Give him one more.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.766
MAN 2:
Yeah! Good.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.368
(dramatic theme music plays)

27:16.435 --> 27:18.671
(audience applauds)

27:21.708 --> 27:25.945
(audience murmuring)

27:26.012 --> 27:27.413
MAN:
Good job.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.553
They didn't cry, did they?

27:34.620 --> 27:36.723
They will.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.995
Played fine,
didn't you think, Monroe?

27:43.062 --> 27:45.097
I mean, some...
trims here and there.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.667
Trims?

27:48.735 --> 27:50.703
Yeah.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.204
-(flips page)
-Right.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.239
Kay?

27:53.305 --> 27:54.440
Yes, Monroe?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.143
Take out your machete.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.048
Oh. I'm off the script?

28:02.114 --> 28:04.283
Afraid so.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.718
-(sighs)
-Dell?

28:05.785 --> 28:07.887
E.B., thanks for your fine work.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.956
We'll find
something else for you.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.766
Excuse me.

28:19.832 --> 28:22.434
KAY: Where do you want me
to start, Monroe?

28:22.501 --> 28:25.004
(sighs)
Bell. Every line.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.873
Can't feel him.
My office, tomorrow?

28:26.939 --> 28:28.474
-Sure.
-(scribbling)

28:30.409 --> 28:33.412
I want a scene where
he goes to confession,

28:33.479 --> 28:36.415
to let go of all
the frustration he's feeling.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.150
But, he's not Catholic.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.386
That's why he can
tell the truth in there.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.189
And change the goddamn title.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.091
The Bells of Boston
is too provincial.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.996
This picture's now called
Angels on the Avenue.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.565
MAN:
Maestro?

28:53.632 --> 28:55.301
(speaks Italian)

28:55.367 --> 28:56.635
Bravo, bravo.

28:56.702 --> 28:57.636
(speaks Italian)

28:57.703 --> 29:00.706
(speaks Italian)

29:00.773 --> 29:02.308
(speaks Italian)

29:02.374 --> 29:03.675
Maestro...

29:03.742 --> 29:04.777
(speaks Italian)

29:04.844 --> 29:07.279
Grazie, grazie.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.815
Ah...

29:08.881 --> 29:11.784
And you're Italian?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.853
Si.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.488
That mean you weren't born
Aubrey Hackett?

29:16.555 --> 29:18.791
(sighs)
Enzo Resteghini.

29:18.858 --> 29:21.928
Came over when I was four.
(sniffs)

29:21.994 --> 29:24.797
Why'd you change it?

29:24.864 --> 29:26.432
You know any famous
screenwriters

29:26.498 --> 29:28.434
named Enzo Resteghini?

29:28.500 --> 29:31.437
(siren approaching)

29:31.503 --> 29:34.440
(siren grows louder)

29:36.876 --> 29:38.978
Pretty bad, huh?

29:39.045 --> 29:42.048
Seemed fine to me.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.449
Eh, you'll get used to it:

29:43.515 --> 29:47.719
the way he kills the ones
who disappoint him.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.056
It's just what he does.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.390
(lipstick closes)

29:51.457 --> 29:55.461
Someone's good enough
until they're not.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.496
That's his talent.

30:00.099 --> 30:04.136
Nobody recasts like Monroe.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.677
STAHR: It won't just be
the script, Pat.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.445
We have to recast Clint, too.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.515
What is Corny flying out here
at 10:30 to tell us?

30:16.582 --> 30:18.084
We'll know by 10:31.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.352
Right now,
let's just fix our movie.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.653
Clint is awful.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.089
Worse,

30:23.155 --> 30:24.790
it looks like he wants
to sleep with Bess,

30:24.857 --> 30:27.059
which is slightly undercutting
the Christmas feel of the thing,

30:27.126 --> 30:28.360
since she's playing
his daughter.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.197
Leslie Reeves
should be our Bell.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.033
Bell's the lead. We'd have
to reshoot the whole movie.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.635
No. Just under half,
if you go by the continuity.

30:36.702 --> 30:37.436
Half.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.738
This could be
our biggest hit ever.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.240
Your movie.

30:41.307 --> 30:44.210
But in this shape, it'll die.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.779
It won't be mine anymore,
will it?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.548
What, the movie?

30:49.615 --> 30:51.483
The studio.

30:52.718 --> 30:56.122
Says Brady-American
on those gates, right?

30:58.925 --> 31:01.093
Do it. Replace him.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.098
We're business as usual until
we're not business as usual.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.438
Fine picture, Mr. Brady.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.540
BRADY:
Uh-huh.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.242
(Kathleen sighs)

31:20.412 --> 31:22.581
It's like being God, isn't it?

31:22.648 --> 31:25.617
If I were God,
it would only take me six days.

31:29.255 --> 31:33.225
I guess if someone is ordinary
in your business,

31:33.292 --> 31:35.861
they don't stay
in your business very long.

31:35.928 --> 31:38.130
You just watched
two hours of ordinary.

31:38.197 --> 31:40.166
Didn't you feel a bit cheated?

31:43.269 --> 31:44.903
Ordinary is the enemy.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.474
Oh.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.113
(scoffs)

31:54.180 --> 31:57.849
Must be a frightening way
to live.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.519
(car engine idling)

32:00.586 --> 32:02.321
(engine turns off)

32:04.190 --> 32:06.325
Can I see you tomorrow?

32:08.727 --> 32:10.662
No. I don't think I should.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.233
Well, another night, then.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.701
No.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.674
Uh, I know this wasn't
a perfect date.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.843
I'm sorry.

32:24.910 --> 32:28.080
Good night, Monroe.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.982
Kathleen...

32:31.984 --> 32:34.220
Kathleen?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.854
Is it something I said?

32:35.921 --> 32:37.523
(sighs)

32:37.589 --> 32:40.459
Something I did?

32:40.526 --> 32:43.695
No.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.064
It's just...

32:45.131 --> 32:48.467
(chuckles)
I'd rather not be

32:48.534 --> 32:51.703
one of those things
you decide to reshoot one day.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.406
It looks like it would hurt.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.841
Tonight was work, all right?

32:55.907 --> 32:58.410
A picture that's in trouble.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.580
Our whole studio
may be in trouble.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.649
But, that's not
how I feel about...

33:03.715 --> 33:06.118
I know you "miss the sound
or Ireland," Monroe.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.420
I can't be a stand-in for Minna.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.823
I'm not her.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.360
I never will be.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.628
I'm actually more
of a Plain Jane.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.000
When people disappoint you,
you, um...

33:22.068 --> 33:25.003
well...

33:25.071 --> 33:29.441
why don't we just see each other
at the restaurant now and then.

33:31.243 --> 33:35.181
It's safer that way.
Good luck with the picture.

33:39.985 --> 33:44.490
(door opens, closes)

33:46.792 --> 33:49.328
(sighs)

33:53.532 --> 33:57.069
(door opens)

33:57.969 --> 34:00.106
He'll be out in a minute.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.413
Mother, nobody at Bennington
was talking about this at all.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.880
Well, that's because
everyone at Bennington

34:09.947 --> 34:11.917
is an idiot, darling.

34:11.983 --> 34:16.487
Oh. Thank you.

34:16.554 --> 34:20.226
I wish my father could've
seen you tonight,

34:20.292 --> 34:22.094
standing up for justice.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.962
Well, justice had nothing
to do with it.

34:24.029 --> 34:25.764
I'm just very fond of my car.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.967
I hope you tell him about this.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.469
Better for Celia if I don't.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.273
I'll bet.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.393
My son talks too much.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.995
We just need to know
what he meant.

34:57.062 --> 34:59.298
Well, the bank's failing.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.767
Uh, they're likely to call
in the note on the studio.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.370
Failing?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.071
Could be next week,
maybe sooner.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.273
Barring a miracle.

35:07.339 --> 35:10.209
That's all our
operating capital.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.278
As a member of the board,

35:12.344 --> 35:13.812
it was your fiduciary duty
to alert us

35:13.879 --> 35:16.215
about any changes in the
financial health of our lender.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.317
We're alerting you now.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.220
I wish you looked
more upset, Corny.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.822
BRADY:
Why should he?

35:23.889 --> 35:25.291
All our assets are now devalued

35:25.357 --> 35:26.892
and suddenly available
for pennies on the dollar,

35:26.958 --> 35:31.330
should some particularly
film-savvy East Coast cocksucker

35:31.397 --> 35:33.332
wish to buy up the whole thing.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.767
Maybe hand the reigns
to his numbskull son, huh?

35:35.834 --> 35:39.638
Pat, this changes nothing.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.541
You'll keep your office
and your job.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.211
It's just that you'll be
reporting to me.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.513
I'll find another lender.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.549
(laughs):
In this economy?

35:50.616 --> 35:52.518
At least I'm the devil you know.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.621
But you're not a movie man.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.458
Meaning what?

35:59.525 --> 36:00.826
Well, meaning tomorrow,
you might decide

36:00.892 --> 36:03.629
this lot would be worth more
as an airfield or a factory.

36:05.664 --> 36:06.865
And you'd do it, wouldn't you?

36:10.869 --> 36:12.371
I'll find another lender.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.275
Let's go, son.

36:22.781 --> 36:23.915
Glove salesman.

36:27.753 --> 36:29.688
You know somebody
who can spare $2 million?

36:29.755 --> 36:32.691
I can turn Angels
into a smash, Pat.

36:32.758 --> 36:35.294
We rush it into theaters,
could buy us some time.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.695
No, we don't have time.

36:36.762 --> 36:37.896
Or a bank.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.633
Ah, what do you care?

36:41.700 --> 36:44.836
Every studio in town will
be calling you by morning,

36:44.903 --> 36:47.406
trying to steal you away.

36:47.473 --> 36:51.377
And what'll you say...
when that offer

36:51.443 --> 36:52.578
from Mayer finally comes?

36:52.644 --> 36:54.613
Your invitation to Valhalla.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.985
I go where you go.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.387
You know that.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.924
What about your, uh...?

37:05.991 --> 37:09.261
Don't you want to spend your
last years on easy street,

37:09.328 --> 37:10.662
in first place?

37:12.531 --> 37:15.301
I fully intend to.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.336
At Brady-American.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.742
(voice breaking):
Brady-American.

37:33.151 --> 37:35.287
(Brady sighing)

37:51.403 --> 37:52.904
Goodness, am I glad to see you.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.641
(sighs)

38:04.316 --> 38:07.218
All previews are terrible.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.888
You taught me that.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.858
Two months from now,
when it's a big smash,

38:12.924 --> 38:14.993
no one will remember
the rough cut.

38:18.997 --> 38:22.167
You know, I had
a fine life before this.

38:22.233 --> 38:25.070
Could've stayed in the glove
trade or bought into oil.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.906
There were opportunities.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.909
But I had to come here.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.778
To make pictures.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.079
Be a movie man.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.847
You are a movie man.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.859
Daddy...

38:47.926 --> 38:52.263
you wouldn't fire someone just
for getting hurt, would you?

38:52.330 --> 38:53.665
Of course not, princess.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.834
Why?

38:55.901 --> 38:57.736
Some studios do.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.580
Listen to me,

39:08.647 --> 39:13.752
please... please
find another business.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.524
There is no other business.

39:25.263 --> 39:26.398
I know.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.900
(chuckles)

39:38.477 --> 39:40.145
(sighs)

39:40.211 --> 39:42.581
(door opens)

39:42.648 --> 39:43.982
(door closes)

39:45.083 --> 39:47.018
(footfalls approaching)

39:52.090 --> 39:54.392
ROSE:
It's funny.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.828
Not that long ago,

39:56.895 --> 40:00.866
you and I turned to each other
to forget our troubles.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.870
Now, you are my trouble.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.071
And I'm yours.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.008
Please, please go.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.345
Rose, I can't.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.948
-Sure you can.
-No.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.884
I can't.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.119
I bet you could
for that waitress.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.855
Kathleen.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.524
Okay.

40:25.591 --> 40:27.793
Then maybe we, uh...

40:27.859 --> 40:30.496
let's try something more exotic.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.263
Do you want to sodomize me?

40:32.330 --> 40:33.465
Or you could...

40:33.532 --> 40:36.001
Get dressed, Rose.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.936
Should I try it
with an Irish accent?

40:38.003 --> 40:39.705
That seems to work
great with you.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.273
Don't.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.341
Don't what?!

40:43.408 --> 40:45.443
Rose...

40:48.246 --> 40:50.181
(sighs)

40:51.917 --> 40:53.051
Jesus.

41:01.493 --> 41:04.496
It was a mistake, right?

41:05.597 --> 41:08.433
A moment of weakness?

41:08.500 --> 41:11.236
It was never supposed to be
for the rest of our lives.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.209
That's right.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.385
PHOEBE (whispering):
Yellow leather.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.154
Red leather.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.355
Yellow leather.

41:30.421 --> 41:31.623
Red leather.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.559
-(knocks on door)
-Yellow leather.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.099
Mr. Stahr...

41:53.912 --> 41:55.847
(sighs)

41:57.148 --> 41:59.517
You lonely or something?

41:59.585 --> 42:01.019
Handsome guy like you?

42:01.086 --> 42:04.322
Yes.

42:04.389 --> 42:05.724
For too long.

42:18.604 --> 42:19.938
What was that?

42:21.272 --> 42:26.111
You're not a stand-in
for anybody, Kathleen.

42:26.177 --> 42:29.715
And you're not something that
I would just... reshoot one day.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.419
-Let me tell you about Minna.
-Oh, no, I don't...

42:34.485 --> 42:36.454
She could be jealous and petty

42:36.521 --> 42:37.856
and impossible.

42:37.923 --> 42:40.458
And I stayed anyway.

42:40.525 --> 42:43.461
I loved her.

42:43.528 --> 42:45.130
See?

42:45.196 --> 42:47.999
I don't like
disloyal people either.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.771
Can we try?

42:55.040 --> 42:57.909
Yes. Yes.

43:10.355 --> 43:12.290
* *

43:24.670 --> 43:26.037
Hello.

43:29.207 --> 43:30.909
The other night,
at the meeting...

43:30.976 --> 43:32.477
I don't want any trouble.

43:32.543 --> 43:34.279
I'm not going to make any.

43:35.513 --> 43:38.016
You're the boss' daughter.

43:40.185 --> 43:41.820
May I?

43:49.494 --> 43:53.531
I know that was dangerous
for you, being there.

43:53.598 --> 43:55.667
But you went anyway.

43:55.734 --> 43:57.235
I want to know why.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.238
I don't like to say.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.741
What happens when
someone gets hurt here?

44:02.808 --> 44:06.277
Are they cared for
or just... replaced?

44:06.344 --> 44:07.679
Well, that's easy.

44:07.746 --> 44:10.348
Just don't get hurt.

44:11.582 --> 44:13.584
Why do you come in so early?

44:13.651 --> 44:16.722
It takes me a couple
of extra hours,

44:16.788 --> 44:18.423
but I like to keep up.

44:18.489 --> 44:19.958
Can I help you?

44:20.025 --> 44:22.527
(chuckling):
It's not yours to do, honey.

44:22.593 --> 44:23.929
Can I help?

44:25.063 --> 44:26.932
-(door opens)
-WOMAN: Good morning.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.399
WOMAN 2:
Good morning.

44:28.466 --> 44:30.401
(women chatting indistinctly)

44:30.468 --> 44:33.371
I think I should work
here for a while.

44:35.273 --> 44:36.407
You do?

44:36.474 --> 44:38.176
Not for pay.

44:38.243 --> 44:43.782
I-I wouldn't want to take a job
away from anyone, I just...

44:43.849 --> 44:47.218
I just need the education.

44:47.285 --> 44:48.987
Excuse me.

44:49.054 --> 44:50.321
Oh.

44:51.556 --> 44:52.891
Yes?

44:55.426 --> 44:56.762
I just started, in Traffic.

44:56.828 --> 44:58.496
My name's Max Miner.

44:58.563 --> 45:03.234
They said I need to get a set of
clean clothes from here first.

45:03.301 --> 45:04.469
Docked from my pay.

45:04.535 --> 45:05.871
They give you a ticket?

45:05.937 --> 45:07.272
Yes, ma'am.

45:07.338 --> 45:08.774
It goes to the desk.

45:10.375 --> 45:12.243
This is Celia.

45:12.310 --> 45:13.478
She can show you.

45:20.786 --> 45:22.020
That's swell, thank you.

45:22.087 --> 45:24.422
-I'm Max.
-Nice to meet you, Max.

45:24.489 --> 45:26.024
It's my first day.

45:26.091 --> 45:28.026
Don't have the hang
of everything yet.

45:28.093 --> 45:30.061
You'd never know it.

45:30.128 --> 45:31.897
Seemed like you were born here.

45:31.963 --> 45:34.232
(chuckles softly)
Right this way.

45:34.299 --> 45:36.501
Yeah.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.503
(indistinct chatter)

45:44.509 --> 45:45.844
Good Lord.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.415
Does this mean you're
gonna be twice as slow now?

45:50.481 --> 45:52.317
Oh, but half as miserable, see?

45:52.383 --> 45:55.553
No one ever had a better time
breaking a few metacarpals.

45:55.620 --> 45:56.955
I hear you're in love.

45:58.156 --> 46:01.159
-Vicious rumor.
-Oh, careful.

46:01.226 --> 46:03.094
Might turn you back
into a human being.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.865
* *

46:14.472 --> 46:15.807
Oh, thank you.

46:24.950 --> 46:27.518
Well, how do I look?

46:28.586 --> 46:29.720
Successful.

46:29.787 --> 46:32.790
Yeah?

46:40.731 --> 46:42.467
* *

46:42.533 --> 46:44.936
It's official?

46:45.003 --> 46:46.471
The bank's calling in the note?

46:50.408 --> 46:51.542
Then we're broke.

46:54.245 --> 46:56.081
All right, uh, other banks?

46:56.147 --> 46:57.282
There aren't any.

46:57.348 --> 47:00.551
-Private lenders?
-I tried.

47:00.618 --> 47:01.953
The whole world's tapped.

47:03.021 --> 47:05.423
Except Germany.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.358
Got a call from our friend,
Dr. Gyssling.

47:07.425 --> 47:08.559
Pat...

47:08.626 --> 47:11.029
He has offered his help.

47:11.096 --> 47:13.231
Well, maybe pass the hat
at the next Nuremberg rally.

47:13.298 --> 47:16.201
Says Germany's
full of capitalists:

47:16.267 --> 47:18.303
IG Farben, Krupp, Thyssen.

47:18.369 --> 47:20.906
He's made the calls,
the money's there.

47:20.972 --> 47:22.573
Along with an eagerness
to invest.

47:25.643 --> 47:27.045
And you said?

47:30.048 --> 47:32.583
(crew member
speaks indistinctly)

47:32.650 --> 47:34.019
(bell rings)

47:34.085 --> 47:36.487
(crew member
speaks indistinctly)

47:36.554 --> 47:39.424
I was sorry to hear
about Muffin, Susan.

47:39.490 --> 47:41.826
That's very kind
of you, Mr. Stahr.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.761
MAYER:
Monroe? Is everything all right?

47:43.828 --> 47:45.163
It sounded urgent on the phone.

47:46.597 --> 47:48.266
Uh, it is.

47:48.333 --> 47:49.600
Well, good.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.269
You finally leaving him?

47:51.336 --> 47:53.171
(chuckles)

47:53.238 --> 47:55.473
Running bet I have with Zukor.

47:55.540 --> 47:59.310
When will Monroe finally get
tired of being the best player

47:59.377 --> 48:02.013
in the minor leagues
and walk through my door?

48:02.080 --> 48:05.083
And if it happens before
Christmas I win a hundred bucks.

48:05.150 --> 48:07.218
Is today the day?

48:10.989 --> 48:13.524
No.

48:13.591 --> 48:15.393
Nothing like that.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.396
Oh, well, damn.

48:18.463 --> 48:20.365
So what is it?

48:23.668 --> 48:27.405
Mr. Mayer, the timing's
not great for this, but...

48:29.607 --> 48:31.042
Pat and I are in trouble.

48:32.643 --> 48:35.646
We need to borrow
a couple million dollars.

48:41.419 --> 48:43.454
(grunts)

48:43.521 --> 48:44.489
Fantastic.

48:44.555 --> 48:46.491
-(bell rings)
-MAN: Quiet on set.

48:48.459 --> 48:49.995
-(chuckles)
-Rolling.

48:55.133 --> 48:57.335
* Smile *

48:57.402 --> 49:01.639
* Though your heart is aching *

49:01.706 --> 49:02.840
* Smile *

49:02.907 --> 49:07.712
* Even though it's breaking *

49:07.778 --> 49:11.649
* When there are clouds *

49:11.716 --> 49:14.685
* In the sky *

49:14.752 --> 49:17.989
* You'll get by *

49:18.056 --> 49:20.225
* If you smile *

49:20.291 --> 49:24.996
* Through your fear and sorrow *

49:25.063 --> 49:26.631
* Smile *

49:26.697 --> 49:31.402
* And maybe tomorrow *

49:31.469 --> 49:34.639
* You'll see the sun *

49:34.705 --> 49:39.077
* Come shining through *

49:39.144 --> 49:42.413
* For you *

49:42.480 --> 49:46.184
* Light up your face *

49:46.251 --> 49:48.919
* With gladness *

49:48.986 --> 49:50.188
* Hide *

49:50.255 --> 49:55.060
* Every trace of sadness *

49:55.126 --> 49:58.963
* Although a tear *

49:59.030 --> 50:00.598
* May be *

50:00.665 --> 50:05.036
* Ever so near *

50:05.103 --> 50:07.872
* That's the time *

* You must keep on trying *

50:12.710 --> 50:14.011
* Smile *

50:14.079 --> 50:18.916
* What's the use of crying *

50:18.983 --> 50:22.187
* You'll find that life *

50:22.253 --> 50:26.357
* Is still worthwhile *

50:26.424 --> 50:32.330
* If you just smile *

50:45.576 --> 50:49.114
* You'll find that life *

50:49.180 --> 50:52.683
* Is still worthwhile *

50:52.750 --> 50:56.754
* If you just *

50:56.821 --> 50:59.224
* Smile. *
