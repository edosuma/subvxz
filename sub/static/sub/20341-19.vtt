(Rolly speaks)

01:04.458 --> 01:06.958
(sighs)

01:06.958 --> 01:11.458
I love curling up on a fresh,
out-of-the-dryer pile
of clean clothes.

01:11.458 --> 01:15.333
Curling up underneath them
is pretty good, too.

01:15.333 --> 01:18.291
Bob:
Wow! Would you look at that?

01:18.291 --> 01:19.833
I wonder what Bob's looking at?

01:19.833 --> 01:21.416
(grunts)

01:21.416 --> 01:24.083
Reporter:
I am here in Italy,
where art lovers

01:24.083 --> 01:27.416
are looking forward
to the opening of this
brand new museum.

01:27.416 --> 01:30.333
Some of the world's
best works of art have
been placed here

01:30.333 --> 01:31.750
for all to enjoy,

01:31.750 --> 01:33.583
and people are eager to see
what will be on display

01:33.583 --> 01:36.333
when the museum opens tomorrow.

01:36.333 --> 01:40.166
I wonder what it would be like
to see something of mine
in that museum?

01:40.166 --> 01:42.875
Like maybe a drawing
of my two favorite pups!

01:42.875 --> 01:44.166
(dogs barking)

01:44.166 --> 01:46.416
All right, stay still.

01:46.416 --> 01:50.583
Gotta get those smiles
just right, and...

01:50.583 --> 01:52.000
done!

01:53.000 --> 01:54.333
Mmm.

01:54.333 --> 01:55.583
(disappointed sound)

01:56.583 --> 01:59.375
If I do get
something of mine
in that museum,

01:59.375 --> 02:02.416
it should probably be
something other than
this silly picture.

02:02.416 --> 02:04.250
(laughs)
Oh, well.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.000
Enjoy the day, fellas.
I've gotta get to work.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.416
-See you later!
-Have a good day, Bob!

02:08.416 --> 02:11.333
If you need me,
I'll be in here.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.333
(giggles)

02:12.333 --> 02:15.416
Rolly, get out of there.
You heard what Bob said.

02:15.416 --> 02:17.333
I did?
What did he say?

02:17.333 --> 02:18.833
He was wondering
what it'd be like

02:18.833 --> 02:21.125
to see something of his
in that art museum,

02:21.125 --> 02:23.625
so we gotta take something
of his there and make sure
that he sees it!

02:23.625 --> 02:26.458
(blowing)
Something like what?
(blowing)

02:26.458 --> 02:28.833
It can't be that silly picture
he drew.

02:28.833 --> 02:30.458
He said it should be
something other than that.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.833
So we need to think
of something else.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.250
Hmm...

02:34.250 --> 02:37.083
Hey!
These pajama bottoms
are something else of his.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.625
Yeah!
He wears them every night!

02:38.625 --> 02:42.583
And they look good on Bob,
so I bet they'd look great
in that museum.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.000
Let's take 'em there
and find out.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.083
If you guys are leaving,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.458
does that mean
the laundry basket is free?

02:48.458 --> 02:50.333
Yep, it's all yours.

02:52.583 --> 02:55.750
Ahh, I just love it
when things are all mine.

to use our collars.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.375
Bow, to the wow, Bingo!

04:07.375 --> 04:08.458
Good grab.

04:08.458 --> 04:09.583
Let's go.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.500
It looks like they grow
a lot of grapes here in Italy.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, they're
all over this place!

04:19.000 --> 04:22.375
Careful not to eat
any grapes, though.
They're bad for puppies.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.208
-Cool.
-Let's take a shortcut
through this vineyard

04:26.208 --> 04:27.625
to get to the museum.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.458
Let's do it!

04:38.875 --> 04:40.833
(Rolly giggling)

04:44.708 --> 04:46.333
Rolly, come on.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.708
Sorry.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.583
(mumbling)

04:55.583 --> 04:58.833
Rolly?
Where are Bob's pajamas?

04:58.833 --> 05:00.416
Oh, no!

05:00.416 --> 05:02.458
They must've got hooked
on one of those grapevines!

05:03.875 --> 05:05.375
Rolly, wait!

05:05.375 --> 05:08.958
Rolly?
Rolly, where are you?

05:08.958 --> 05:10.958
Rolly:
This way, Bingo!

05:13.000 --> 05:16.208
-Bingo!
-There you are!

05:16.208 --> 05:18.583
We've gotta get those things
outta there!

05:18.583 --> 05:21.166
This looks like a job
for Bingo and Rolly!

05:22.458 --> 05:27.583
(grunting)

05:32.875 --> 05:36.208
-We did it, Rolly!
-Wait right there, PJ pants.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.458
Where do we go next?

05:41.458 --> 05:42.875
This way, Rolly.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.750
We gotta get Bob's PJs
down to that museum.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.208
Do you see anything
that looks like that museum
we saw on TV?

05:52.208 --> 05:53.291
No.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.083
But I smell something great.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.000
Rolly, wait!

05:59.458 --> 06:01.958
Rolly, are you in here?

06:01.958 --> 06:03.583
Over here, Bingo!

06:04.583 --> 06:06.958
Ahh!
I found what I was smelling!

06:06.958 --> 06:08.625
This spaghetti sauce!

06:08.625 --> 06:09.833
Delicioso!

06:09.833 --> 06:13.000
Rolly, come on.
We need to take
Bob's pajamas and--

06:14.000 --> 06:15.208
Where are Bob's pajamas?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.708
Oops!
They fell into this pot
when I said,

06:18.708 --> 06:21.583
"Ahh! Delicioso !"

06:21.583 --> 06:23.458
-Well, we need to get them out!
-(door opening)

06:23.458 --> 06:24.708
(whistling)

06:24.708 --> 06:26.208
Look out!

06:27.750 --> 06:29.958
Dinner is served!

06:33.458 --> 06:37.291
-Oh, no!
-That waiter took the plate
with Bob's pajamas on them,

06:37.291 --> 06:38.708
and we need to get 'em back!

06:38.708 --> 06:40.000
How are we gonna do that?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.458
I have an idea!

06:45.458 --> 06:46.833
No pajamas there.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.583
Hey, where'd those PJs go?

06:55.750 --> 06:57.000
Just what we ordered!

06:57.000 --> 07:00.375
Yeah!
And that spaghetti
looks pretty good, too!

07:00.375 --> 07:01.958
We should find out
if it is.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.583
(eating/slurping)

07:10.708 --> 07:13.416
I thought this spaghetti
tasted like pajamas.

07:13.416 --> 07:17.625
-Me, too.
-But now that we've got em,
let's find that museum!

07:21.583 --> 07:23.708
That building looks like
it's about to fall over.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.000
It really is a leaning tower.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.583
But not if you tilt your head
like this.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.583
Yeah!
Now it's straight up!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.291
Hey!
Give us back Bob's pajamas!

07:35.291 --> 07:36.458
Where'd they go?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.708
All the way over there!

07:41.958 --> 07:44.708
Ooh!
I've been looking for
a colorful scarf to wear

07:44.708 --> 07:47.375

at the new art museum!

07:47.375 --> 07:49.708
(bite)
Mmm! Grazie!

07:49.708 --> 07:52.500

07:52.500 --> 07:55.375
And he's wearin' Bob's pajamas

And that guy's taking
Bob's pajamas in there!

08:44.708 --> 08:46.250

need to make sure

09:53.083 --> 09:54.458

09:54.458 --> 09:55.750
Hmm.

09:58.958 --> 10:01.708
Now where did those
puppies go?

10:04.083 --> 10:05.833
He's gone!

10:05.833 --> 10:07.291
Sorry, Mr. Statue,

10:07.291 --> 10:09.833
but we're gonna need
Bob's pajamas back!

10:09.833 --> 10:12.208
Come on!
I think I saw a place over here

10:12.208 --> 10:13.500
where we can put Bob's pajamas

10:13.500 --> 10:14.750
and he'll see them for sure!

10:14.750 --> 10:17.375
But there's a better place
for him to see 'em over here!

10:17.375 --> 10:18.750

10:18.750 --> 10:20.708
But I wanna go that way!

-Ahh...
-Huh...

10:34.625 --> 10:37.833
-Well,that's
a pretty good place.
-Yeah. Not just Bob,

10:37.833 --> 10:40.166
but everyone will see
his pajamas right there.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.250
Which means...

10:41.250 --> 10:42.875
bow to the wow!

10:44.291 --> 10:46.833
Reporter:
The art world is abuzz tonight
over a work of art

10:46.833 --> 10:50.750
that mysteriously appeared
at the museum while no one
was looking.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.875
Ohh, I can't wait
to see what everyone
is so excited about!

10:54.875 --> 10:58.958
The artwork, made of fabric
and elastic, is accented
with vibrant colors

10:58.958 --> 11:02.708
of purple and red,
with splotches of bright yellow.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.375
Those are your pajamas, Bob!

11:04.375 --> 11:06.875
We took them to Italy
and put them in the museum
so you could--

11:06.875 --> 11:09.625
(barking)

11:09.625 --> 11:13.083
Well, it looks like
you guys like-- uh,
whatever that is.

11:14.083 --> 11:17.333
Ha!
It kinda looks like
my old pajamas!

11:17.333 --> 11:18.625
They are hard to recognize

11:18.625 --> 11:21.375
with all the juice
and sauce all over 'em.

11:21.375 --> 11:24.833
But that reminds me,
I bought some new pajamas

11:24.833 --> 11:26.708
to replace my really old ones,

11:26.708 --> 11:29.416
and I get to wear them tonight!

11:29.416 --> 11:31.208
-(laughs)

11:32.875 --> 11:36.125
Sweet dreams,
puppy team!

11:36.125 --> 11:39.250
I'm glad Bob got to see
something of his
in that museum!

11:39.250 --> 11:43.166
Yeah, now we can curl up
and go to sleep knowing
that we finished our mission.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.833
Race you to the laundry basket!

11:45.833 --> 11:48.000
-Ahh!
-I missed this place!

11:48.000 --> 11:49.875
What? Huh? Huh? Hey!

11:49.875 --> 11:52.583
Hissy?
Have you been sleeping
down there all day?

11:52.583 --> 11:55.500
Yep.
And now I'm gonna sleep here
all night.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.000
Ahh!
See you in the morning!

11:58.000 --> 12:00.458
(both giggling)

12:05.000 --> 12:07.083
(Bingo speaks)

12:08.291 --> 12:09.708
Hmmm...

12:09.708 --> 12:11.583
What
are we looking for, Bingo?

12:11.583 --> 12:15.000
I don't know.
I was only looking up
because you were looking up.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.458
And I was only looking up
because Bob was looking up.

12:17.458 --> 12:21.208
(sigh)
It's not happening, fellas.
It's gettin' really cold,

12:21.208 --> 12:22.875
which means winter
is almost here

12:22.875 --> 12:25.208
and the first snowflakes
should be falling
out of the sky,

12:25.208 --> 12:28.000
but, heh, I don't see it!

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So I'm gonna
have to wait even longer
to use this.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.125
And boy, do I like
to slide down on hills

12:33.125 --> 12:35.708
right after
the very first snowfall.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.208
Oh!
Hangin' on to the sides
of my sled

12:38.208 --> 12:40.208
while wearing
my new gloves!

12:40.208 --> 12:43.166
(gasps)
Which I forgot to buy!

12:43.166 --> 12:46.125
Oh!
I need to get to the store
and buy some new gloves

12:46.125 --> 12:50.583
so I can go sledding as soon
as the first snowflake
falls out of the sky!

12:50.583 --> 12:55.083
Oh!
I just hope I get home
before anything starts falling!

12:55.083 --> 12:56.500
I wish we could find

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
that first snowflake
of winter for Bob.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.000
Or a whole bunch of snowflakes!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.875
Like when it snows in the park
and the place gets all snowy.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.875
Rolly!
That's a great idea!

13:04.875 --> 13:07.750
It was.
What was?

13:07.750 --> 13:10.125
We should go to the park
and look for snowflakes there.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.958
Then we can come back
and tell Bob

13:11.958 --> 13:14.000
we saw
the first snowflake of winter!

13:14.000 --> 13:16.958
That'd be a good mission,
if that was our mission.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.083
Rolly, that is our mission!

13:19.083 --> 13:20.875
Oh, then it's a good one!

13:20.875 --> 13:21.958
Both:
Let's go!

13:21.958 --> 13:24.291
(both giggling)

13:30.000 --> 13:32.875
Ooh!
Bob must've added
something new to the doghouse!

13:36.083 --> 13:38.708
ARF:
Analyzing environmental
conditions to determine

13:38.708 --> 13:40.958
appropriate
doggie dress-up!

13:42.375 --> 13:43.958
Stay warm, puppies!

13:47.250 --> 13:49.750
Both:
♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba ♪

13:49.750 --> 13:52.208
♪ We're goin' on mission,
goin' on a mission ♪

13:54.458 --> 13:57.125
-Thanks for the ride, ARF.
-I hope it's not too cold
for you.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.708
Brr!
ARF's face is a little chilly.

13:59.708 --> 14:03.375
But Bob made ARF
with a built-in face warmer.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.708
(hiss)

14:05.708 --> 14:07.458
Ooh, that is nice!

14:09.250 --> 14:10.875
Rolly:
It looks like
that first snowflake

14:10.875 --> 14:12.416
could fall anywhere around here.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.833
Yeah!
So let's get looking!

14:13.833 --> 14:16.250
And while you are looking,
ARF will stay here

14:16.250 --> 14:17.875
with ARF's face-warmer.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.250
(steam)

14:19.250 --> 14:22.166
ARF's face says "Ahh."

14:22.166 --> 14:24.875
Keep your eyes
on the skies, Rolly.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.291
Hey!

14:28.291 --> 14:30.000
What's up, double-pups?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Hello there, single-squirrel!

14:32.000 --> 14:33.291
Whatcha guys doin',

14:33.291 --> 14:35.583
wanderin' around
all lookin' for somethin'?

14:35.583 --> 14:37.583
We're tryin' to find
the first snowflake of winter.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.875
Yeah!
Bob wants to use his sled
'cause winter's almost here!

14:40.875 --> 14:42.291
Winter's almost here!

14:42.291 --> 14:44.000
But I haven't even buried
a single nut!

14:44.000 --> 14:47.708
I've been lyin' around so much,
I didn't even think about
burying any nuts!

14:47.708 --> 14:49.250
Aw, nuts!

14:51.416 --> 14:53.875
We could help you
if you want.

14:53.875 --> 14:54.958
I'm listening.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.250
We're double-dog-rific
at burying things.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.583
So, if you can find nuts
for us to bury...

14:59.583 --> 15:01.000
This tree is full of them!

15:01.000 --> 15:03.416
(grunts)

15:03.416 --> 15:04.875
Look out below!

15:09.250 --> 15:11.083
Oww! Hey!

15:11.083 --> 15:14.125
Sorry! (grunting)

15:14.125 --> 15:19.000
-Bullseye!
-Thanks! Now I can get back
to lyin' around again!

15:19.000 --> 15:22.583
Oh, hey!
If you see any snow, like,
in the form of a flake,

15:22.583 --> 15:23.958
could you let us know?

15:23.958 --> 15:25.000
Snowflake!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.166
-Where?
-(gasp) Really?

15:26.166 --> 15:28.708
No, I was just sayin'
what I'll say if I see one!

15:28.708 --> 15:30.291
Snowflake!
You know?

15:30.291 --> 15:32.166
(dogs giggle)

15:33.708 --> 15:35.500
I never realized
how big the sky is

15:35.500 --> 15:36.875
until I was watching

15:36.875 --> 15:38.250
for a snowflake to fall
out of it.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.000
Well, we're just gonna
have to keep looking up
until we see--

15:41.000 --> 15:42.625
Both:
Whoa!

15:42.625 --> 15:44.416
Hello!
Did you have a nice trip?

15:44.416 --> 15:47.125
Heh-- 'Cause you--
you tripped.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.333
Sorry.
We weren't looking
where we were going.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.875
I'm Bingo.
And this is my brother Rolly.

15:51.875 --> 15:54.291
-I'm Funny.
-Yes, you are.

15:54.291 --> 15:57.291
That joke about us
having a nice trip
was hilarious!

15:57.291 --> 16:00.000
No, that's my name!
(laughs) Funny Bunny!

16:00.000 --> 16:01.875
-Knock-knock.
-Who's there?

16:01.875 --> 16:04.083
I already told you!
Funny Bunny!

16:04.083 --> 16:06.583
(laughs)

16:06.583 --> 16:10.750
Hey, you haven't seen
the first snowflake of winter
around here, have you?

16:10.750 --> 16:14.708
Winter? Today?
Now that's funny!

16:14.708 --> 16:16.291
(chuckles)

16:16.291 --> 16:18.125
We're not being funny, Funny.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.250
Bob said winter
is almost here,

16:20.250 --> 16:23.000
and we're lookin' for snow
so we can say "Here it is!"

16:23.000 --> 16:26.958
Oh no.
I was supposed to find a home
before winter got here!

16:26.958 --> 16:29.333
But I was too busy
thinking up ways to be funny!

16:29.333 --> 16:31.333
-Like, knock-knock.
-Who's there?

16:31.333 --> 16:34.166
Winter!
And I'm not ready for it!

16:34.166 --> 16:36.000
You want us to help you
find a home?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, we're already
looking for snowflakes!

16:38.000 --> 16:40.333
We could add
"a home for Funny"
to the list,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.125
and do two missions at once.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.250
That would make me
one happy hopper.

16:44.250 --> 16:48.333
This is the perfect place
to dig out a home for a bunny
named Funny.

16:48.333 --> 16:52.208
(gasps)
Custom-built, just for me?

16:52.208 --> 16:55.750
Yeah!
Could you watch for snowflakes
while we dig it?

16:55.750 --> 16:57.291
Abso-tootly!

17:02.250 --> 17:03.875
Well, what do you think?

17:05.708 --> 17:09.000
Uh, I like it a "hole" lot!

17:09.000 --> 17:10.291
(laughs)

17:10.291 --> 17:12.708
A "hole"!
Anyway, okay...

17:12.708 --> 17:15.750
Come on, Rolly.
We have to keep lookin'
for that snowflake

17:15.750 --> 17:19.166
so Bob can go "whoosh,
whoosh," on his sled.

17:19.166 --> 17:22.458
Then let's go "whoosh, whoosh,"
while we're looking.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.000
Both:
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

17:25.000 --> 17:27.250
Where are they?

17:27.250 --> 17:29.166
This is the place
we're supposed to meet, right?

17:29.166 --> 17:30.250
Weren't we supposed
to meet here?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.416
Oh, ho, ho, ho...

17:31.416 --> 17:34.083
Excuse me... little bird?

17:34.083 --> 17:35.625
Have you seen any snowflakes
around here?

17:35.625 --> 17:38.291
No... and I hope I don't.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.250
That'd mean it's winter,
and I'm supposed to fly south
with the other birds

17:41.250 --> 17:43.333
before it gets wintry
and cold!

17:43.333 --> 17:44.625
(wind blowing)

17:44.625 --> 17:46.291
Oh, no.
It's getting wintry and cold.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.208
What if the other birds
left without me?

17:48.208 --> 17:50.416
They wouldn't do that.
Not if they're your friends.

17:50.416 --> 17:52.125
Where was the last place
you saw them?

17:52.125 --> 17:55.250
Um, I think they were
on a statue of a man

17:55.250 --> 17:56.625
who was smiling and happy.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.875
I know where that is!
Come on!

18:01.708 --> 18:03.208
This is where I last
saw my friends,

18:03.208 --> 18:05.583
but (sigh)
they're not here.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.458
And neither
is that first snowflake!

18:07.458 --> 18:10.000
But the other birds
are here!

18:10.000 --> 18:11.375
(birds chirping)

18:11.375 --> 18:13.375
On the other
happy and smiling man!

18:13.375 --> 18:14.958
Oh!

18:17.125 --> 18:19.625
It sure was nice of you all
not to leave without me.

18:19.625 --> 18:22.708
-(birds chirping)
-Good luck finding
your snowflake!

18:22.708 --> 18:24.875
Thanks!
Have a nice flight!

18:24.875 --> 18:27.250
(gasp)
Bingo, look!
It's snowing!

18:27.250 --> 18:29.166
No, they're
just feathers, Rolly.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.375
Oh.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.875
It was the right color and all.
I got excited!

18:36.875 --> 18:38.250
I'm starting to wonder

18:38.250 --> 18:40.625
if anything is ever gonna
fall out of that sky.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.125
I hope something does.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.208
Otherwise, Bob's sled
won't slide.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.458
Hedgie:
Hey, keep it down out there!

18:46.458 --> 18:48.000
Some of us are trying to sleep!

18:48.000 --> 18:49.125
Who's that?

18:49.125 --> 18:50.250
Are you talking to us?

18:50.250 --> 18:53.000
That depends.
Were you the loud ones

18:53.000 --> 18:56.333
going "blah, blah, blah"
about stuff that's not
falling out of the sky?

18:56.333 --> 18:58.375
-That was us.
-Then yes.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.083
I was talking to you.

19:00.083 --> 19:03.583
Sorry.
We've been looking for
the first snowflake of winter.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.583
But all we've found
were a bunch of animals

19:05.583 --> 19:07.583
that didn't even know
winter was on the way.

19:07.583 --> 19:10.333
Agh!
How can they not know
winter is on the way?

19:10.333 --> 19:14.083
That's why
I'm down here, getting ready
to start hibernating!

19:14.083 --> 19:16.000
Getting ready
to hiber-what-huh?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Hibenating means
he goes to sleep all winter.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.458
Which
I can't do while you two
are keeping me awake!

19:22.458 --> 19:24.875
Would it help if my brother
and I sang you a lullaby?

19:24.875 --> 19:26.875
That's how our friend, Bob,
gets us to fall asleep.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.958
Hey, I don't need two puppies
singing some night-night song

19:30.958 --> 19:32.833
until I go nappy-nap!

19:34.750 --> 19:39.625
But... if you wanted to sing,
I'd probably listen...

19:42.458 --> 19:43.708
(musical note)

19:45.500 --> 19:47.583
(whispers)
One, two, three, one...

19:47.583 --> 19:51.333
Both:
♪ It's sleepy time again ♪

19:52.333 --> 19:56.291
♪ Go to sleep
my little friend ♪

19:57.958 --> 20:02.416
♪ Close your eyes
and get some rest ♪

20:03.416 --> 20:06.958
♪ This lullaby
is the best ♪

20:09.875 --> 20:11.958
(whispers)
Sleeping like a baby...

20:11.958 --> 20:13.583
Hedgie:
Except, he's not.

20:13.583 --> 20:17.583
For me to go to sleep,
I need three things:
a bedtime snack,

20:17.583 --> 20:22.625
a soft place to lay my head,
and I need the lights
to be out all the way!

20:22.625 --> 20:25.625
A snack, a soft place,
and all the lights out?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.875
I think we can get you
all three!

20:28.875 --> 20:32.458
Hey there,
doggie-diggers, I haven't seen
that first snowflake yet,

20:32.458 --> 20:34.000
but I'm still lookin'.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.333
Yeah, we haven't
seen it, either.

20:36.333 --> 20:39.000
But we do see a couple more nuts
up there, and uh,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.166
we're wondering if we could
take 'em for a friend?

20:41.166 --> 20:43.250
Sure thing, double-pups.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.958
Thanks, single-squirrel!

20:47.958 --> 20:49.416
(sniffing)

20:51.250 --> 20:53.000
Hey, guys!
Did you find
that first snowflake

20:53.000 --> 20:54.458
of winter yet?

20:54.458 --> 20:56.708
No.
But right now we're looking
for the perfect rock

20:56.708 --> 20:58.125
that'll fit perfectly.

20:58.125 --> 21:01.458
The perfect rock?
That sounds hard!

21:01.458 --> 21:05.291
Ha!
Oh, Funny, you
are so funny!

21:05.291 --> 21:06.458
Rolly:
Found one!

21:07.750 --> 21:09.333
(giggles)

21:10.875 --> 21:13.416
A mouthful of these
should be just right!

21:17.750 --> 21:20.166
Here you go.
A bedtime snack...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.500
Some soft feathers
for your head...

21:26.458 --> 21:28.375
And it's time
for lights out!

21:29.625 --> 21:31.250
Happy hibernating!

21:31.250 --> 21:34.500
Finally, I can go to sleep!

21:34.500 --> 21:38.500
Although, it might be nice
to hear that lullaby again.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.875
I thought it was kinda pretty.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.583
(whispering)
One, two, three, one...

21:43.583 --> 21:47.875
Both:
♪ It's sleepy time again ♪

21:47.875 --> 21:52.375
♪ Go to sleep
my little friend ♪

21:53.625 --> 21:58.458
♪ Close your eyes
and get some rest ♪

21:59.458 --> 22:02.458
♪ This lullaby is the best ♪

22:02.458 --> 22:07.291
(snoring sounds)

22:07.291 --> 22:09.625
That is one
hibernatin' hedgehog.

22:09.625 --> 22:12.625
I'm glad we were able
to help everyone get ready
for winter,

22:12.625 --> 22:14.958
but we've looked everywhere
for the first snowflake,

22:14.958 --> 22:16.458
and still haven't found it.

22:16.458 --> 22:17.500
Yeah!

22:18.500 --> 22:21.500
(gasp) Don't move!

22:21.500 --> 22:24.250
Bow to the wow!
There it is!

22:24.250 --> 22:25.583
Is it a snowflake?

22:25.583 --> 22:26.875
The first one of winter!

22:26.875 --> 22:29.500
Then let's find ARF
and get home to tell Bob
we found it!

22:30.458 --> 22:32.333
Bob:
I'm home!

22:32.333 --> 22:34.000
(dogs barking)

22:34.000 --> 22:38.958
I got my new gloves
and they fit like-- well,
like something that really fits!

22:38.958 --> 22:40.083
(dogs barking)

22:40.083 --> 22:42.375
Bob!
We found the first snowflake!

22:42.375 --> 22:44.500
That means winter is here
and you can go sledding!

22:45.583 --> 22:47.708
Hey... what's that?

22:47.708 --> 22:49.291
Oh! Is that--?

22:49.291 --> 22:52.583
(gasp)
It's a snowflake!

22:52.583 --> 22:55.958
Oh!
And another snowflake!

22:55.958 --> 22:57.583
Winter is here!

22:57.583 --> 23:00.166
Ooh... gotcha! Ha-ha!

23:00.166 --> 23:01.500
And you!

23:01.500 --> 23:03.500
And you! Ah! Oh!

23:03.500 --> 23:04.750
Oh! (laughs)

23:04.750 --> 23:06.875
Oh! (laugh) Oh!
Keep on falling, snow!

23:06.875 --> 23:09.458
-'Cause I'm ready to sled!
-(meow)

23:09.458 --> 23:11.875
Hey!
Who's ready to sled with me?

23:11.875 --> 23:13.250
-We are--
-Bob!

23:13.250 --> 23:15.750
(dogs barking)

23:15.750 --> 23:18.458
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

23:18.458 --> 23:22.458
-Whoo-hoo! Whoa!
-(dogs giggling)

23:27.250 --> 23:28.625
(theme music playing)

23:30.708 --> 23:32.375
Bingo/Rolly:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:35.958 --> 23:37.208
Bark!
Bark! Bark!

23:39.708 --> 23:41.375
(record scratching)

23:47.333 --> 23:48.375
Bark!

23:51.750 --> 23:53.000
Bark! Bark! Bark!
