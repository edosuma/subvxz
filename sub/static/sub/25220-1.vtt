05:36.160 --> 05:38.800
There were so many who
lost their homes in the fires,

others threatened by neighbors,
persecuted in the streets.

were in perfect order.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.396
These are terrible times.
We could take no chances.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.791
I know. Your letters that reached us
have torn the community's heart out,

06:04.880 --> 06:06.758
so we took up a collection.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.559
It's not as much as I had hoped.

Tarquin? But he's so young for orders.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.953
He's loyal. He's a Roman boy.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.039
He lost both his parents in the fires.

This is Cassius, his cousin.

what the community was doing.

Oh, my God.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.677
Nero says the reason is
to show the Roman people

07:03.760 --> 07:06.355
that these followers of Christ
were responsible

07:06.440 --> 07:08.591
for burning half the city to the ground.

We're at a crossroads.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.876
We're not sure whether
to continue here in faith

07:20.000 --> 07:22.435
or to move the whole community
out of Rome.

We're the only light left in this city.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.395
But in staying,

07:33.480 --> 07:35.949
we put a great deal of lives in danger.

conviction in the others, Paul.

18:06.160 --> 18:09.198
These men, these women, these children.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.158
I cannot fix their faith.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.071
You can inspire their faith,

18:16.520 --> 18:19.319
just as your...
Your letters always have.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.076
You want me to write another letter?

18:26.880 --> 18:28.837
It's time to get the blood flowing.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.240
The Way is growing.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.514
There are men, women, children
now that have never met you,

18:36.600 --> 18:38.319
that will never meet you,

18:38.400 --> 18:41.313
so there must be a handwritten
account of these Acts.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.555
It is for the same reason
that I undertook an account

18:44.640 --> 18:47.030
of our Lord Jesus Christ for Theophilus.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.555
So that he would know
the story of Christ,

18:50.040 --> 18:52.839
and now the people must know your story.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.837
You risk people looking to me

18:56.600 --> 18:57.716
before Christ.

18:57.800 --> 18:58.870
Paul.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.274
No, it is your certainty
that opens the door to Christ.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.391
I have never met Christ in the flesh,

19:06.680 --> 19:11.038
but the day I heard you preach in Troas,
my God, I saw Christ in you.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.597
I left my family and my friends,
my whole life behind.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.833
You would write it in here?

19:30.160 --> 19:31.913
What did you say?

19:33.440 --> 19:34.954
You would write it here?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.190
Yes.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.592
I could smuggle the tools in here.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.870
This is not like our last visit to Rome.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.037
If you were caught with documents

19:45.880 --> 19:47.314
coming from this prison,

19:47.760 --> 19:49.240
it could mean certain death.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.433
GUARD: Greek. Get up.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.155
Usually people try to escape this place,

20:04.720 --> 20:06.120
not break into it.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.516
- They tell me you're a physician.
- I am.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.155
You have high-ranking friends
for a physician.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.679
Especially a Greek physician.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.310
The emperor has declared
Christianity a forbidden cult

20:19.400 --> 20:21.631
and Paul of Tarsus, the chief offender.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.236
You understand the risk is death,
and yet you, a Greek Christian,

20:25.960 --> 20:28.520
boldly walk into a Roman prison.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.750
(CHUCKLES)

20:32.440 --> 20:34.671

20:39.520 --> 20:42.513
As you have said,
I have high-ranking friends.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.160
I know the men that you have favor with.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.914
These are good men,

20:48.360 --> 20:50.829
that have fought and bled
for Rome and her gods.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.600
It's the only reason
I honor this request.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.519
I am grateful for it.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.431
Escort the Greek back to the streets.

take his chances out there.

That's good.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.196
PRISCILLA: We've loved this city
as our own.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.992
AQUILA: I only see what it's become.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.400
Nero's Rome.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.360
Nero's madness.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.316
It'll pass.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.040
He can't be emperor forever.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.351
How many more people
will die before then?

23:09.120 --> 23:11.351
This decision weighs heavily on me.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.317
I receive no wisdom in prayer.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.677
In staying, we put the lives
of all our brothers and sisters

23:18.760 --> 23:20.399
under this roof in danger.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.554
And if we go,
how many people that rely on us

23:25.360 --> 23:27.591
do we condemn to a terrible fate?

23:30.280 --> 23:31.680
Christ was clear when he said

23:31.760 --> 23:33.911
he was sending us out
amongst the wolves.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.710
He also told us
to be as wise as serpents.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.152
And harmless as doves.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.480
As Paul has said,

23:44.880 --> 23:47.440
we must each make our own decision.

23:55.240 --> 23:56.560
She loves these people.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.120
AQUILA: Like her children.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.078
And yet she still finds room
in her heart

24:03.160 --> 24:05.072
for all of those lost in Rome.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.396
Something that doesn't come
as easily to me.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.674
Aquila, I saw them burning
a body this morning.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.994
He was a man I recognized from here.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.240
Someone I helped.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.309
I did nothing.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.157
I feel no love for these Romans.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.150
This evil makes no sense to me.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.276
(ALL CHATTERING)

24:51.680 --> 24:53.797
We were asked to build a community...

24:54.560 --> 24:57.837
We were asked to build a community
in this city,

24:59.480 --> 25:02.552
to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ,

25:02.840 --> 25:04.718
to love this city,

25:05.280 --> 25:08.352
but I can no longer see
a clear answer for a way forward.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.434
What does Paul say?

25:13.880 --> 25:16.031
That this is something that

25:16.960 --> 25:18.792
falls to each man and woman

25:19.000 --> 25:20.593
in their thoughts and prayers.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.869
AQUILA: Some of you
have families, have children.

25:24.520 --> 25:28.070
I understand you want to protect them
or feel called to stay.

25:29.640 --> 25:33.270
It's a risk for even one of us, Aquila,
to try and slip in and out of the gates.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.878
How could we possibly all get out?

25:36.240 --> 25:39.995
I have asked Eubulus to find us a way.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.911
There's an old aqueduct
that lies beneath the new city.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.798
It's been long buried and forgotten.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.120
The entrance to these tunnels
lies beneath a property

25:49.200 --> 25:52.159
owned by a trio
of wealthy Roman families.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.790
And why would they help us?

25:53.880 --> 25:57.191
Because they realize that Nero
was responsible for burning

25:57.280 --> 25:58.760
half of their city to the ground.

25:58.840 --> 26:02.072
They want the tyrant dead
and Rome returned to the people.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.033

26:10.240 --> 26:12.675
- And where will we go?
- AQUILA: To Ephesus.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.396
Timothy is there
and they will welcome us.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.995
And the Greeks are
far more tolerant of us.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.914
We were Romans before we were Christian.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.560
This is our home.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

26:27.400 --> 26:29.756
I do not take this decision lightly.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.400
But I believe that there is
more good to be done outside of Rome.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.955
PRISCILLA: Aquila's right.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.635
But I think there's also
some good in staying.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.236
It's true, we've never seen Rome darker.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.355
But if we abandon it,
will it not be cast into total darkness?

26:48.360 --> 26:50.431
Who would have taken Tarquin in?

26:51.440 --> 26:54.274
You know what happens
to orphans in this city.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.557
They're left on the streets to die.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.838
Or they're forced
into prostitution at the temples.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.472
There are widows on the street corners

27:03.600 --> 27:05.671
begging for coins
to feed their children.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.713
If we abandon them,

27:08.200 --> 27:09.680
who will feed them?

Who will care?

that want to overthrow Nero.

from Nero's evil grip.

will be getting news to these families,

Why does that Greek care
to visit him in that disgusting pit?

33:30.480 --> 33:32.278
He dictates something to him.

33:33.680 --> 33:34.670
A letter?

33:36.800 --> 33:37.836
A story.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.436
(GRUNTS)

34:10.040 --> 34:11.713
Her condition is no better.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.594
She will be healed.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.074
And if not?

34:45.600 --> 34:47.751

34:51.280 --> 34:52.396
Paul.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.199
Give me your hand.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.595
You were screaming out.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.560
The devil sneaks in the darkness here.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.915
Taunts me...

35:14.400 --> 35:15.550
Day and night...

35:18.480 --> 35:21.837
Reminding me of this
terrible thorn in my flesh.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.273
I'm haunted by myself as a child.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.516
I wish to warn him
of the path he will take.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.314
All these years,
I have had a vision of them.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.393
I see them

35:50.800 --> 35:52.712
waiting

35:53.360 --> 35:54.999
somewhere...

35:56.600 --> 35:58.796
But I do not know this place.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.312
<i>Its meaning has always
been hidden from me.</i>

36:05.200 --> 36:07.954
<i>A torturous muse, the devil whispers</i>

36:08.040 --> 36:10.680
<i>that they've found no peace...</i>

36:12.160 --> 36:14.152
<i>They've found no joy.</i>

36:21.320 --> 36:22.640
(SHIVERING)

36:35.240 --> 36:38.312
I was remembering
when Caelia was a little girl.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.157
She used to sit at the window

36:43.520 --> 36:45.637
and watch small sparrows

36:46.160 --> 36:48.152
sing and fly around the garden.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.230
She would have been there
all day if I'd let her.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.831
Do you remember our place
before the fires?

36:57.400 --> 36:59.437
The light through the windows...

37:00.520 --> 37:02.557
Flowers, the trees in the garden.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.512
I was a noble woman.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.076
The wife of a Roman hero.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.753
It is Nero's madness.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.036
I do not blame Nero.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.878
It is no help that you walk
around this place

37:22.960 --> 37:25.156
as if the gods have already taken her.

37:26.080 --> 37:29.278
Don't you think you anger them by acting
like they have no power to heal?

37:29.360 --> 37:33.070
I have been sacrificing faithfully
every day!

37:34.680 --> 37:36.990
My conscience is clean.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.436
I do not think that I'm the one
the gods refuse to listen to.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.960
(SURREAL MUSIC PLAYING)

38:05.840 --> 38:07.672

38:11.320 --> 38:12.879
PUBLIUS: There he is.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.000
Mauritius...

38:15.120 --> 38:17.760
Your glum mood threatens
to make this lovely lass

38:17.840 --> 38:19.797
more expensive than she needs to be.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.759
- Here, let me order you one. Elysius.
- Publius.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.239
Thank you, no.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.640
Run along.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.232
How is prison life?

38:34.320 --> 38:37.199
You know as well as I it's a disgrace.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.193
A black mark of dishonor
on my house and family.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.793
Twenty years of service to Rome,

38:43.880 --> 38:46.156
risking my life
to earn my citizenship,

38:46.240 --> 38:49.153
and now forced to take
idle servant's work

38:49.240 --> 38:52.870
while Nero makes a mockery
of everything Rome stands for.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.838
These are the troubled times, my friend.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.034
But that is why the gods keep
the day of our death a mystery,

38:58.120 --> 39:00.316
so that we can enjoy this life.

39:01.520 --> 39:02.874
I'm sorry.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.997
Friend, how is your daughter?

39:06.360 --> 39:07.874
Worse by the day.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.474
I sacrifice to Bona Dea,
but she does not reply.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.075
Then sacrifice to Carna or Meditrina,

39:14.160 --> 39:15.879
and to Felicitas, Fortuna...

39:15.960 --> 39:18.316
Juno, Libera, Sors, Spes, Trivia.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.596
There are a hundred gods that stand by.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.680
Paul of Tarsus is under my watch.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.031
The man responsible
for burning down Rome?

39:28.400 --> 39:30.471
He's nothing but Nero's scapegoat.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.710
(SCOFFS)

39:33.280 --> 39:35.875
What do you really know
about these Christians?

39:36.400 --> 39:39.791
I rarely find them in the
establishments that I frequent.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.678
But I do know
they have a strange affection

39:41.800 --> 39:44.679
for poor widows and ugly orphans.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.630
But if you want to know
what the gods think of them,

39:47.760 --> 39:49.433
just take a look around.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.479
You'll see they're not even fit
to light the streets of Rome.

39:53.920 --> 39:57.914
There is a Greek who slips in and out,
transcribing letters of some sort.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.752
Mauritius, your mind has gone to rubbish

40:00.840 --> 40:02.991
in the darkness of that prison.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.512
What if you were to seize these letters,

40:05.640 --> 40:08.109
find something, anything,
that relates to the crimes

40:08.200 --> 40:10.431
- he's been charged of?
- Nero does not need evidence.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.398
Assassination is in the air.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.359
Half the city believes Nero
started the fires himself.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.636
But if you were to bring him something

40:17.720 --> 40:21.475
that shows that this Christian
did conspire and burn down Rome,

40:21.720 --> 40:25.873
you would be a hero in Nero's eyes,
the most honored man in all Rome.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.791
Mauritius, think of your daughter.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.793
How much more would the gods listen

40:30.880 --> 40:33.839
if the emperor himself made
a sacrifice for her?

40:41.600 --> 40:43.796
Is it true that he has seen the Messiah?

40:43.920 --> 40:45.240
Paul, that is.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.720
CASSIUS: Where's Luke? Luke!

40:47.520 --> 40:50.240

40:55.840 --> 40:57.752
Careful. Careful. Lie him here.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.118
CASSIUS: I found him in the street.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.517
They said he was beaten by soldiers

41:02.600 --> 41:04.557
after leaving Palatine Hill.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.554
No!

41:26.600 --> 41:28.751
No. No. (SOBBING)

41:38.720 --> 41:41.030
This is what trusting God gets you.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.758
We must retaliate for this brutal act.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.355
Many of us have only
a short time left in this city.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.909
- We must hold strong now.
- Hold strong?

42:03.040 --> 42:04.997
So we're like diseased dogs, then?

42:05.080 --> 42:07.993
We do nothing to defend ourselves,

42:08.080 --> 42:10.311
while we are chased from
the city just to be hunted down

42:10.400 --> 42:11.550
- and killed.
- PRISCILLA: Cassius!

42:13.000 --> 42:15.071
We understand your anger.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.031
Tarquin was like a son to us.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.077
I should never have let him go.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.159
CASSIUS: Why do you blame yourselves

42:26.320 --> 42:28.357
and not the ones who have murdered him?

42:28.800 --> 42:31.235
And who else have they taken from you?

42:31.360 --> 42:33.238
- (CROWD MURMURING)
- This woman has come to you

42:33.400 --> 42:34.834
covered in the blood of her child.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.959
AQUILA: And what would you do, Cassius?

42:37.600 --> 42:40.160
Tell me. What would you do?

42:42.400 --> 42:43.880
We do what they do to us.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.235
MAN: Yes.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.712
Murder them in the cover of darkness!

42:47.800 --> 42:50.713
- I'm with you, Cassius!
- Set fire and burn them

42:50.800 --> 42:52.314
in their homes while they sleep!

42:52.400 --> 42:54.392
AQUILA: You speak as if
your ears have never heard

42:54.480 --> 42:55.596
the words of Christ.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.512
You never walked with Christ!

42:58.920 --> 43:00.877
How can you say he would
say these things in the face of

43:00.960 --> 43:04.078
- such an evil like Nero?
- Quiet!

43:06.160 --> 43:07.753
Be still.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.473
None of us here have walked with Christ.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.398
But Paul has followed him
longer than us all.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.520
I have watched him be beaten,

43:19.600 --> 43:22.672
I have watched him
be stoned and flogged,

43:23.440 --> 43:27.354
and never once did he raise his finger
against his oppressors.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.597
Let peace be with you,
for we live in the world,

43:31.680 --> 43:34.275
but we do not wage war
as the world does.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.553
Peace begins with you, Cassius.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.994
Love is the only way.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.834
There was a young Roman boy, Tarquin.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.716
He was killed in the streets last night.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.995
He was beloved by the community.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.750
Most of them trust the Way.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.519
But he has this cousin who is...

44:11.600 --> 44:14.160
He's dividing them, Paul.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.279
This growing faction
of young men that...

44:19.600 --> 44:21.876
They want to retaliate.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.429
They want revenge.

44:24.520 --> 44:28.275
We cannot repay evil for evil.

44:30.880 --> 44:34.840
Evil can only be overcome with good.

44:38.880 --> 44:42.510
Well, considering
all they've been through,

44:42.680 --> 44:46.117
can you really fault
their response, Paul?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.832
What did you tell them?

44:50.520 --> 44:52.796
Love is the only way.

44:54.200 --> 44:57.034
And after all you've seen,

44:58.360 --> 45:00.795
you still don't believe it?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.396
This isn't anything I've seen.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.473
My God...

45:10.160 --> 45:12.391
This is a world in the grip of evil.

45:12.520 --> 45:14.318
This is Nero's circus.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.511
It's passionate hate.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.557
Blood washing down the street,

45:18.640 --> 45:20.677
widows, orphans starving to death.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.911
Babies born with the slightest defect

45:23.000 --> 45:25.310
are disposed, dispatched, discarded.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.869
This world

45:27.960 --> 45:30.520
doesn't know a thing about love.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.193
And so you would give up
on the world when Christ

45:32.280 --> 45:34.192
- did not give up on us?
- Why not?

45:34.280 --> 45:35.760
- No!
- Why not?

45:35.840 --> 45:37.991
Love is the only way.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.872
Love that suffers long.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.237
Love that is kind,

45:48.680 --> 45:51.559
that does not envy, that is not proud.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.432
Love that does not dishonor,

45:56.880 --> 45:59.679
that does not seek for itself.

46:03.440 --> 46:06.478
Love that is not easily angered.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.832
Love that rejoices in truth.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.390
Love that never delights in evil.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.315
Love that protects,

46:22.400 --> 46:24.835
trusts, hopes,

46:26.920 --> 46:29.640
endures all things.

46:33.280 --> 46:35.590
That kind of love.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.712
Give me your hand.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.110
Do you understand?

46:54.640 --> 46:56.916
Then write it down.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.471
<i>I once wanted vengeance,</i>

47:04.560 --> 47:07.394
<i>like Cassius and these young men.</i>

47:08.800 --> 47:11.838
<i>I know this path of destruction
more than anyone.</i>

47:14.560 --> 47:18.110
<i>I hated those that followed Christ.</i>

47:20.760 --> 47:24.151
<i>I hunted them down like wild animals.</i>

47:28.320 --> 47:31.711
<i>And when they fled Jerusalem,</i>

47:31.800 --> 47:34.838
<i>I went to the temple
to the chief priests,</i>

47:34.920 --> 47:38.675
<i>to obtain authority to go to Damascus</i>

47:39.400 --> 47:42.518
<i>and arrest all those
that followed the Way.</i>

47:43.080 --> 47:46.630
<i>I was determined
to be God's hand ofjustice.</i>

47:47.760 --> 47:49.592
<i>His wrath.</i>

47:53.280 --> 47:55.397
LUKE: You believed what you were doing

47:55.480 --> 47:57.631
was out of a love for God.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.719
PAUL: A blind love.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.039
I only knew the law.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.520
If water flows

48:03.600 --> 48:05.512
down a mountain, what besides a miracle

48:05.600 --> 48:07.432
could cause it to flow back?

48:08.400 --> 48:10.278
The road to Damascus was

48:10.800 --> 48:12.473
your miracle.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.952
PAUL: <i>Yes.</i>

48:15.040 --> 48:17.874
<i>The road to Damascus.</i>

48:19.480 --> 48:21.790
JESUS CHRIST: <i>Saul... Saul...</i>

48:21.880 --> 48:26.113
<i>Why do you persecute me?</i>

48:29.280 --> 48:31.636
SAUL: <i>Who are you, Lord?</i>

48:33.840 --> 48:36.230
<i>Who are you, Lord?</i>

48:36.840 --> 48:38.832
JESUS CHRIST: <i>I am Jesus,</i>

<i>whom you are persecuting.</i>

MAN 1: He can't see.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.759
JUDAS: Here. Lay him here.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.832
MAN 2: Something... Something
happened on the road.

48:49.920 --> 48:51.274
Something like a light.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.477
There was a voice, a voice like...

48:53.560 --> 48:55.153
Like thunder.

48:55.240 --> 48:58.392
He fell to his knees,
as if he were struck down.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.790
And he was shouting out the words...

49:00.880 --> 49:02.792
"Who are you, Lord?"

49:02.880 --> 49:06.191
MAN 1: All the way here
he has been saying aloud

49:06.280 --> 49:09.114
that Jesus is the Messiah.

49:12.760 --> 49:14.991
ANANIAS: Saul of Tarsus,

49:15.080 --> 49:17.197
can you hear me?

49:21.320 --> 49:22.834
Ananias?

49:26.640 --> 49:28.632
You know who I am?

49:32.400 --> 49:36.360
The Lord showed me a vision
that you would come to me.

49:39.760 --> 49:41.672
They tell me

49:41.760 --> 49:44.150
you have lost your mind,

49:44.240 --> 49:47.278
that you haven't eaten
or had anything to drink

49:47.360 --> 49:48.760
in three days.

49:50.640 --> 49:53.872
Your actions against
those that follow Christ

49:53.960 --> 49:56.600
and all the harm you have done

49:58.280 --> 49:59.714
is well reported.

50:01.200 --> 50:05.319
I know you have come here
on authority of the chief priests

50:05.400 --> 50:09.394
to arrest all those
who call on the Lord's name.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.996
I am a wretched man.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.794
I deserve death.

50:27.480 --> 50:28.834
Yes.

50:29.640 --> 50:31.199
We all do.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.435
Yet,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.639
Christ

50:40.440 --> 50:42.318
has set us free.

50:47.600 --> 50:49.239
Brother Saul,

50:51.200 --> 50:53.032
the Lord Jesus,

50:53.240 --> 50:56.597
who appeared to you on the road
as you were coming here,

50:58.480 --> 51:02.633
has sent me so that you may see again

51:03.280 --> 51:05.158
and be filled

51:06.440 --> 51:08.716
with the Holy Spirit.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.314
Brother Saul,

51:14.520 --> 51:16.830
receive thy sight.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.033
(WATER SPLASHING)

52:05.240 --> 52:06.913
LUKE: Everything in your life changed,

52:09.280 --> 52:10.919
yet you continued on.

52:12.240 --> 52:14.277
Three years in Arabia.

52:16.760 --> 52:18.114
Why?

52:22.400 --> 52:25.154
Peter and the others spent
three years with Christ.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.918
I had to do the same.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.918
I had to learn how to pray,

52:33.000 --> 52:34.719
how to speak.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.399
How to love.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.560
All right, old man.

52:44.240 --> 52:46.311
Tell me everything that followed.

52:51.560 --> 52:54.598
BALBUS: Prisoner, on your feet.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.559
The Greek, too.

53:01.520 --> 53:02.670
Sir.

53:10.440 --> 53:11.920
A chair, perhaps?

53:12.040 --> 53:13.793
I will stand.

53:14.720 --> 53:17.189
I recognize the way you stand,

53:17.840 --> 53:19.797
like a man who has been
flogged repeatedly.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.395
They say the spine bends
and does not heal properly.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.476
Am I correct?

53:28.160 --> 53:29.389
You are correct.

53:30.400 --> 53:32.960
I am sure you are aware
of the responsibility I have

53:33.040 --> 53:35.919
for the detainment
of every prisoner in this place.

53:36.240 --> 53:41.872
I am well aware that to lose a prisoner
means death for you and your men.

53:42.560 --> 53:43.710
Exactly.

53:44.520 --> 53:47.354
Then you understand my current concern.

53:47.440 --> 53:50.797
Prefect, do you think
that we are plotting an escape?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.231
Well, a man who has been charged
with burning down Rome

53:55.320 --> 53:58.199
meets in secret with a Greek
for all hours of the night.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.958
Perhaps you're not only plotting
an escape,

54:01.040 --> 54:02.269
but an uprising.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.872
- For what purpose?
- Vengeance.

54:06.320 --> 54:11.031
Followers of your cult are being beaten,
raped and killed for sport.

54:11.120 --> 54:15.239
It is for the Lord's sake
that we face death all day,

54:16.520 --> 54:19.831
that we are considered
as sheep to be slaughtered.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.917
Even the sheep will revolt
if whipped hard enough.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.958
Do you think that I have
come to Rome against my will?

54:32.840 --> 54:35.753
That I am in this cell by accident?

54:37.160 --> 54:40.551
I care very little
about the circumstances of your arrival.

54:40.880 --> 54:42.678
I am concerned with these documents

54:42.880 --> 54:45.952
that are being generated
in the very heart of my prison.

54:48.240 --> 54:51.119
So, depending on my finding,
I will determine what should be done.

54:51.440 --> 54:54.274
Consider the Greek a threat
to Rome until proven otherwise.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.918
Put him in the dark with the preacher.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.400
Whatever the cost, I'd pay for it.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.073
It's not an issue of cost.

55:16.160 --> 55:17.992
It's an issue
of whatever this illness is.

55:18.840 --> 55:21.116
I have never seen
anything like this before.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.280
Please.

55:47.880 --> 55:49.599
- I understand your pain, Cassius.
- Understand?

55:49.720 --> 55:51.359
- Don't say you understand.
- But Christ spoke of love

55:51.440 --> 55:52.840
- and peace and patience.
- You understand nothing.

55:52.920 --> 55:54.036
- You respond in the flesh.
- People are dying

55:54.160 --> 55:55.560
every day because of us.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.233
I've lost my whole family!

55:57.320 --> 55:59.312
- Family? You speak of family?
- Yes. My family.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.119
You listen to me!
I still have my family,

56:01.200 --> 56:02.554
and I will not put their lives at risk

56:02.640 --> 56:03.960
- for a foolish plan!
- You coward!

56:04.040 --> 56:05.315
Just think of your family!

56:05.400 --> 56:07.551
- No! No! No!
- What would you do, then?

56:07.640 --> 56:08.994
No! Keep your voice down!

56:09.080 --> 56:10.878
Luke has been thrown into prison.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.155
- What?
- On conspiracy.

56:12.240 --> 56:13.390
What did you say?

56:13.480 --> 56:16.075
Luke has been thrown into prison.

56:16.880 --> 56:19.793
And I've gathered men willing to storm
that prison and free them.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.156
- To what end, Cassius?
- Justice.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.475
Justice?

56:24.400 --> 56:26.517
Think of how foolish
Nero will look having lost the man

56:26.600 --> 56:29.115
- he accused of burning down Rome.
- OCTAVIA: No.

56:29.520 --> 56:31.671
If you're caught,
they'll come here for us all.

56:31.760 --> 56:33.194
- Listen to me. Please.
- Exactly.

56:33.280 --> 56:36.239
Listen to me! We can align ourselves

56:36.320 --> 56:40.234
with these powerful families
to overthrow Nero.

56:40.640 --> 56:43.280
And we can bring peace to Rome
if we rule it.

56:43.360 --> 56:46.876
Christ asked us to care
for the world, not rule it.

56:47.640 --> 56:49.120
Listen closely.

56:49.200 --> 56:51.431
All of you, listen to me closely.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.194
Some of you may want
to stay in the city...

56:57.360 --> 56:59.875
And some of you may want to leave.

57:00.440 --> 57:02.557

I can't stop thinking about Tarquin.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.199
The poor boy.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.478
We sent him out there, Aquila.

57:35.960 --> 57:38.077
I know. I blame myself.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.231
I should have taken it.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.557
We've lost so many, Priscilla.

57:44.640 --> 57:47.439
I can't bear the thought
of losing any more.

57:48.160 --> 57:51.358
I believe it's time to leave Rome
with the knowledge that we could be

57:51.440 --> 57:54.035
better protected and serve elsewhere.

57:56.280 --> 57:59.000
I pray that God works good through it.

58:02.360 --> 58:04.636
And I pray that you'll forgive me,

58:06.840 --> 58:10.675
because I believe that God
is calling us to different paths.

I know you love this city, its people.

you were imprisoned in Rome

You used to sing those awful songs
in the middle of the night.

Excuse me, but they were
from my childhood,

59:33.600 --> 59:34.920

it's the only thing
that puts me to sleep.

than Timothy's mother.

59:41.880 --> 59:42.870
We never met.

with just a touch of his cloak.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.440
A healer?

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.398
No, my point, you don't make
a man your leader

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.392
just because he trips
and falls in the road

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.473
and then travels around a bit and

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.550
says a few things.

There must be more to the story.

to confess something.

What else would he say that he
hasn't already spoken at his trial?

A man on trial will say whatever
he can to save his hide.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.676
But he has been convicted.
He will be executed.

for my work for Christ.

So you have certain powers,

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.839
but claim to have no authority
to use them.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.551
You've done miraculous things,
yet do not boast for glory.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.076
You make no wages for your work.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.120
You're sounding less like
a leader and more like a slave.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.795
A slave that has been set free.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.111
We're Romans. We're already free men.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.714
All men are a slave to something.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.360
That Greek,

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.993
he is risking his life for you.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.115
Why?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.279
He believes people should know
the certainties of my life.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.597
My daughter is sick.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.474
If I pray to your Christ,
your God, will she be healed?

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.433
I don't know.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.874
His ways are not my ways.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.350
So you offer nothing.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.720
I offer the truth of salvation
that has been set on my heart.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.233
The Greek can take his papers.
I see no value in them.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.554
He'll be released tomorrow.

The Greek, Luke,

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.871
he is a great physician.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.593
His talents are unmatched.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.559
No.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.398
I would not anger the gods
by bringing a Christian into my home.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.472
I said that you could help his daughter.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.598
How could I bring healing when he
and Rome bring so much suffering?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.594
You know this man even better than I do.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.194

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.069

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.710
just as he does the gods of Rome.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.115
In your account of the Lord,
why did you write so often

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.157
of the poor

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.673

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.075
I guess I wanted others to understand

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.912
God's kingdom is open to us all,

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.832
that his mercy is for everyone.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.000
Exactly.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.439
We can never forget
what it was like to be lost.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.879

Do not worry, brother.

When the moment comes,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.754
you will have the strength
to do what is right.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.995

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.314

to get out for fresh air,

might hear you speak?

that you treat this man of Tarsus,

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:25.910
who spits in the face of Rome,
with a degree of sympathy.

He's a Roman citizen.

If there is any degree of kindness,
it's because of that.

is harboring a Greek Christian

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.831
against a direct order of your emperor?

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.272
You should be tried
and executed for conspiracy.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:46.796
And yet you think that I anger the gods!

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:50.473

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.040
