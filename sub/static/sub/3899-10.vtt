they're gonna do you different.

I'm real sorry.

this much responsibility before.

03:42.432 --> 03:43.433
It's weird.

But I really like it here
and I don't wanna fuck it up,

03:47.396 --> 03:50.399

Anyway, uh, I like talking to you
and hanging out with you and stuff.

04:17.885 --> 04:24.099
And I guess maybe I just wasn't sure
how to express that... or something.

04:24.183 --> 04:26.435

No?

- Is that...
- Well, I...

that you can do with this?

doing crazier things than that

a little agitated right now.

to fucking kill me!

- Don't know what she's talking about, sir.

take your shots and walk away

drooping from sadness.

12:15.820 --> 12:19.783
And I'm not interested in sitting around,
analyzing everything I do anymore.

12:19.866 --> 12:20.867
Hmm.

12:21.826 --> 12:26.581
Bravo to you.
That was an excellent speech.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.167
No, really.

12:29.250 --> 12:33.463
Almost as good as Bill Pullman's
freedom speech in Independence Day.

12:33.547 --> 12:38.843
[Piper] Fuck Bill Pullman
and his stupid, smarmy, thin-lipped face.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.638
[gate opening]

12:48.687 --> 12:50.522
I see you!

12:50.605 --> 12:52.816
That's right.
Run, rabbit, run.

12:58.029 --> 13:01.115
Oh, man, focus on this line.
I'm gonna finish.

13:01.199 --> 13:03.785
You can do this. You can do this.
You're a champion.

13:08.247 --> 13:09.583
- Hey.
- Wait.

13:09.666 --> 13:12.210
I think I have something to help.

13:13.211 --> 13:14.838
That's fantastic.

13:14.921 --> 13:15.922
You think so?

13:16.005 --> 13:19.509
I mean, I hoped you'd think so.
I just wasn't sure.

13:19.593 --> 13:21.345
I do.

13:21.428 --> 13:23.304
I really do.

13:24.723 --> 13:26.350
What are we talking about again?

13:26.433 --> 13:28.059
Uh, your writer's block.

13:28.142 --> 13:29.603
Um...

13:29.686 --> 13:32.606
I wrote this for you. [chuckles]

13:37.944 --> 13:42.031
It's probably better
if you read it out loud,

13:42.115 --> 13:45.034
so you can hear the rhythm.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.502
"Here are some ideas for your series,

13:53.585 --> 13:56.880
because I know you've been
getting a lot of queries.

13:58.757 --> 14:01.300
I can tell you've been feeling stressed.

14:01.385 --> 14:03.928
Perhaps that's because you're repressed.

14:06.139 --> 14:11.728
May I suggest you pander to your audience
with more girl-on-girl stuff?

14:11.811 --> 14:14.272
It's not rocket science."

14:18.192 --> 14:22.364
- That's not a pure...
- Pure rhyme, I know.

14:22.447 --> 14:23.948
There's more. Go on.

14:26.826 --> 14:29.203
"Why not let me be helpful?

14:29.287 --> 14:31.790
You might've noticed I'm eligible."

14:31.873 --> 14:36.461
Yes, another slanted rhyme.
Keep going.

14:36.545 --> 14:40.549
"If you need to
research the activities,

14:40.632 --> 14:45.637
I'd be happy to join you,
as I have homo-proclivities."

14:45.720 --> 14:47.556
You don't have to say anything.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.308
Please don't.

14:50.392 --> 14:54.479
It would be, um, too much for me.

14:55.772 --> 14:58.567
I'm gonna be
in the broom closet tonight...

14:59.609 --> 15:00.735
after dinner.

15:02.070 --> 15:03.905
I hope you'll meet me.

15:24.968 --> 15:27.971
This one time, my sister and I
were at a drive-through,

15:28.054 --> 15:30.890
and right when we pulled up
to the speaker to order,

15:30.974 --> 15:34.310
she just started giggling
for no real reason.

15:34.393 --> 15:37.564
She just couldn't stop,
and so I started laughing.

15:37.647 --> 15:40.775
And I think we were there for,
like, five whole minutes

15:40.859 --> 15:45.404
with this voice saying over and over,
"Hello? Are you ready to order?"

15:47.156 --> 15:50.076
I didn't mean to laugh at Leanne,

15:50.159 --> 15:52.829
but I just got this picture in my head
of that Amish thing,

15:52.912 --> 15:56.165
and it's... genetic.

15:56.249 --> 15:58.251
Genetic nervous laughter.
I can't control it.

15:58.334 --> 16:00.253
- Did you tell her that?
- No.

16:01.463 --> 16:04.758
It probably would have come out
all wrong anyway.

16:04.841 --> 16:06.926
I never seem to say the right thing.

16:07.010 --> 16:10.096
And you're caught in that cycle
where you feel like no one likes you,

16:10.179 --> 16:13.850
so you start trying too hard,
which only makes you more unlikable.

16:13.933 --> 16:18.396
Is this where you tell me to
take the happy pills and stop whining?

16:19.689 --> 16:22.066
- [sighs]
- Brook, you're in prison.

16:22.150 --> 16:25.028
I can't imagine a more reasonable time
for you to experience depression.

16:25.111 --> 16:26.655
Your response is appropriate.

16:27.572 --> 16:30.199
Why should that be medicated?

16:30.283 --> 16:32.368
Because I feel so horrible.

16:34.245 --> 16:35.413
I'm so lonely.

16:35.497 --> 16:37.999
Well, now you have me.
You can come in here and chat every day.

16:38.082 --> 16:40.418
No offense, but that's, like, so lame.

16:41.335 --> 16:44.088
It's like being that kid
who has to eat lunch with the teacher

16:44.172 --> 16:46.049
'cause no one else
wants to eat with her.

16:46.132 --> 16:49.135
Or maybe you're
having a hard time making friends

16:49.218 --> 16:52.263
because you're different from
the other women in here, Brook,

16:52.346 --> 16:55.058
and maybe that's not a bad thing.

16:59.228 --> 17:00.438
[chuckles]

17:01.147 --> 17:02.440
[Blanca] Hmm...

17:03.107 --> 17:04.442
[speaking Spanish]

17:05.777 --> 17:07.403
She has six toes on her right foot.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.781
- Ew.
- [continues speaking Spanish]

17:09.864 --> 17:11.490
And she lived in a Greyhound bus
for a year.

17:12.742 --> 17:16.037
- [speaking Spanish]
- [laughing]

17:16.119 --> 17:19.624
Her mother doesn't believe in
13th birthdays, so she had to skip it.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.000
Number three's a lie.

17:21.084 --> 17:22.919
[laughing]

17:23.002 --> 17:25.171
No way, she ain't got no six toes.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.464
No, no, she does.
I saw that shit once.

17:26.548 --> 17:27.549
- What?
- [Maritza] Oh.

17:27.632 --> 17:30.218
- It's like a little nubbin.
- That's nasty. That's nasty.

17:30.301 --> 17:33.638
No, but whose mommy is crazy enough
to make her skip a birthday?

17:33.722 --> 17:35.890
Pero you seen Blanca
on one of her bad days.

17:35.974 --> 17:37.100
That shit's in your blood.

17:37.183 --> 17:38.434
Coño, nobody's gonna choose the bus

17:38.517 --> 17:40.687
because that's normal for everybody?

17:40.770 --> 17:42.146
[all] Yeah.

17:44.566 --> 17:47.068
- Oh, what's Red Rover up to?
- Beats me.

17:47.151 --> 17:51.155
I'm keeping busy,
as all of you should be trying to do, too.

17:51.239 --> 17:53.658
Can't listen to
all this hen chatter anymore.

17:53.742 --> 17:55.326
But how we supposed to keep busy

17:55.409 --> 17:58.287
if throwing those fart bags
into boiling water takes 10 minutes?

17:59.038 --> 18:01.332
- [exclaiming]
- Holy shit, fresh veggies.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.376
Keep off of 'em.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.088
Purpose, girls.

18:08.297 --> 18:10.634
Everyone needs to find her purpose.

18:12.343 --> 18:13.803
Beautiful, what have you got?

18:13.887 --> 18:16.430
Look at this.

18:35.950 --> 18:40.955
Your skin looks like
it will be very soft. [chuckles]

18:41.039 --> 18:44.167
You know, like a peach
or a baby pig's belly. [laughs]

18:44.250 --> 18:45.543
[chuckles nervously]

18:45.627 --> 18:51.549
I aspire to put my hands on it
and to inhale your hair.

18:51.633 --> 18:53.009
[sighs heavily]

18:53.885 --> 18:54.928
In my dreams,

18:55.011 --> 19:01.935
it smells like freshly-baked gingerbread
and my mother's rice pudding...

19:02.852 --> 19:04.896
swirled together.

19:04.979 --> 19:06.397
Oh! [chuckles]

19:06.480 --> 19:08.942
- That is quite a combination.
- Yeah.

19:10.568 --> 19:12.445
[Crystal] He know he's been punished,

19:12.528 --> 19:15.824
and then I find him hiding in his closet
with his phone, texting some girl.

19:17.116 --> 19:19.493
His phone that was locked
in my desk drawer.

19:19.577 --> 19:21.537
You broke into your mother's desk?

19:21.620 --> 19:23.665
She can't take my shit.
It's mine.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.917
Do you see that?

19:26.960 --> 19:30.129
Hey, nothing is yours.

19:30.213 --> 19:32.006
You live by the grace of me.

19:33.174 --> 19:35.509
[Sophia] Michael, look at me.

19:35.593 --> 19:38.805
This behavior of yours is unacceptable.

19:38.888 --> 19:40.348
I don't know what's going on with you,

19:40.431 --> 19:43.059
but you need to
get your act together right now.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.143
You don't get it.

19:44.227 --> 19:46.938
What don't I get?
Tell me.

19:47.021 --> 19:49.190
- You need to stop.
- Stop what?

19:49.273 --> 19:50.608
Acting like you care.

19:51.776 --> 19:52.777
Michael, I just want...

19:52.861 --> 19:54.195
I don't care what you want.

19:55.196 --> 19:58.116
- Michael, get back here now.
- What you gonna do about it?

20:10.544 --> 20:12.088
Something on your mind, pumpkin?

20:12.171 --> 20:13.297
I'm gonna kill her.

20:13.381 --> 20:14.716
You gotta be more specific than that.

20:14.799 --> 20:16.801
Sophia, she's over there...

20:16.885 --> 20:19.971
she's having a nice visit with her son
while I'm over here doing what?

20:20.054 --> 20:21.848
Nothing, trying to stay busy, huh?

20:21.931 --> 20:24.183
Ignoring the fact that
she took my son away from me

20:24.267 --> 20:26.102
even though he didn't even do nothing.

20:26.185 --> 20:28.646
Did I tell you about that?
I talked to him.

20:28.730 --> 20:33.442
He said it was all Michael.
Â¡El pendejito ese! It was all him.

20:33.526 --> 20:34.736
Benny, he ran.

20:34.819 --> 20:37.947
Benny ran as soon as
he saw them starting to fight.

20:38.531 --> 20:41.492
You mentioned that once or twice
or 15 times, yes.

20:42.035 --> 20:43.286
I miss...

20:45.121 --> 20:48.707
I miss him, mana.
I miss him. I miss all of them.

20:48.792 --> 20:50.001
I know.

20:54.964 --> 20:56.174
You want some of mine?

20:56.257 --> 20:58.009
You are so stupid.

20:58.092 --> 20:59.803
[both chuckling]

21:00.469 --> 21:02.513
Which one is it again?

21:02.596 --> 21:06.392
- The cute one with the scraggly goatee.
- Oh.

21:07.811 --> 21:09.353
I still maintain you'd make a good dyke.

21:10.188 --> 21:11.230
Come on.

21:11.314 --> 21:13.691
Diving into all that facial hair,
no different than pussy.

21:13.775 --> 21:14.818
Ugh.

21:14.901 --> 21:17.904
First of all, that's really gross,
okay? Jesus.

21:19.155 --> 21:21.282
And, secondly,
I actually really like him, all right?

21:21.365 --> 21:22.784
It's not because of all the donuts.

21:22.867 --> 21:24.243
Mmm.

21:24.327 --> 21:27.080
We talk about things and stuff...

21:27.163 --> 21:28.456
Deep shit.

21:29.082 --> 21:30.834
Hey, maybe next time
you could suck his dick,

21:30.917 --> 21:32.001
get us an ice cream cake.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.921
Come on, you know
that would melt before it got here,

21:35.004 --> 21:37.841
so that's not a good idea, duh.

21:37.924 --> 21:39.675
[rock music playing]

21:48.059 --> 21:50.144
- [gun firing]
- Oh, yeah.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.522
[Pennsatucky]
Do you have an extra cigarette?

21:53.606 --> 21:55.399
- [gun firing]
- [glass shattering]

21:56.317 --> 21:58.652
[man] Yeah, sweet.

22:19.298 --> 22:21.885
Hey, Doggett, you down?

22:23.094 --> 22:26.890
I told you I only accept Visa,
MasterCard or Mountain Dew.

22:26.973 --> 22:29.725
[chuckles] Damn.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.060
Can you put me on a payment plan?

22:31.144 --> 22:33.812
Get that shit to you tomorrow, I swear.

22:35.523 --> 22:37.108
You look hot in that skirt.

22:37.191 --> 22:38.192
Mmm.

22:43.281 --> 22:44.823
[Pennsatucky] Sure.

22:44.908 --> 22:46.617
[Abe] Come on, all right.

22:49.245 --> 22:50.788
Yeah, I told you.

22:55.584 --> 22:56.710
[Abe] Yeah.

23:02.341 --> 23:03.384
Ow!

23:03.467 --> 23:04.760
Fuck me!

23:04.843 --> 23:06.595
I just got bit or stung by something.

23:06.679 --> 23:09.557
- Well, come on, get back here.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

23:09.640 --> 23:11.642
[Abe] Oh, come on,
don't do that.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.145
Shut the fuck up.
I just got stung or bit.

23:14.228 --> 23:15.563
I was almost there, Tiff.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.398
Oh, fuck you and your blue balls.

23:17.481 --> 23:18.942
[Abe] Oh, you gonna leave me unfinished?
All right.

23:19.025 --> 23:20.526
[Pennsatucky] Fucking hurts.

23:22.445 --> 23:23.654
[rock music continues]

23:30.036 --> 23:31.037
You okay?

23:32.163 --> 23:35.166
No, I think I got
a spider bite or a bee sting.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.503
- One sec.
- Yeah.

23:47.178 --> 23:49.055
Let's have a look.

23:51.682 --> 23:53.517
What, are you a faggot or something?

23:53.601 --> 23:57.355
[chuckles] No, my family camps a lot.

23:57.438 --> 24:00.358
Is being prepared for emergencies
not manly down here?

24:00.441 --> 24:01.567
[groaning]

24:01.650 --> 24:03.111
Ow.

24:03.194 --> 24:06.697
Nah, I just wouldn't
spread it around too much.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.741
So, what, did y'all
just move here?

24:08.824 --> 24:10.576
Yeah...

24:10.659 --> 24:12.911
my dad's working at the mine...

24:12.996 --> 24:15.873
till he gets fired for being a drunk
and we move again.

24:16.582 --> 24:18.626
Yeah, but you don't gotta worry
about that around here,

24:18.709 --> 24:20.044
'cause everybody's a drunk.

24:23.172 --> 24:25.508
There you go...

24:25.591 --> 24:26.800
you're all patched up.

24:27.843 --> 24:28.886
Thank you.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.972
I'm Nathan.

24:32.056 --> 24:36.935
You wanna hang out sometime?
See a movie or something?

24:39.147 --> 24:40.814
What do I gotta do?

24:42.275 --> 24:43.359
Uh...

24:44.277 --> 24:45.528
be my date?

24:49.323 --> 24:50.324
All right.

24:51.242 --> 24:53.536
- All right, I'll see you.
- Stop.

24:53.619 --> 24:54.662
[Nathan chuckles]

25:02.795 --> 25:04.588
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

25:09.635 --> 25:10.761
[sniffing]

25:13.681 --> 25:16.016
Hello, curly-haired person.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.685
Hey.

25:18.811 --> 25:20.979
- You Jewish, right?
- Cuban.

25:21.689 --> 25:22.690
Shit.

25:23.982 --> 25:25.193
Really?

25:29.572 --> 25:32.158
Extra fruit cup for you, Norma.

25:37.246 --> 25:38.914
Where the fuck were you today?

25:40.249 --> 25:41.667
Is that a real question?

25:41.750 --> 25:44.212
Like, you, for real,
want me to make the prison joke?

25:44.712 --> 25:46.797
Judy King got sentenced this morning.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.549
- Oh, shit, yo!
- [both laughing]

25:48.632 --> 25:50.759
- Shh!
- [whispers] Sorry.

25:50.843 --> 25:52.928
Why are you not allowed to talk?

25:53.011 --> 25:56.307
[softly] It's all about not contributing
to the noise and shit.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.517
Yo, don't think I'm crazy or nothing,

25:58.601 --> 26:02.730
but it actually sort of
makes me feel calm...

26:03.647 --> 26:07.025
like the wall's not closing in on me...
like I can breathe.

26:07.110 --> 26:10.613
I didn't hear anything you just said.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.532
But your girl's guilty,
and she's probably coming to Litchfield.

26:13.616 --> 26:16.369
They're gonna announce it
[yelling] tomorrow!

26:16.452 --> 26:18.287
[softly] Judy King coming here?

26:18.371 --> 26:20.956
That's what I just said!

26:21.039 --> 26:23.626
[softly] Unless my noise
is too much for you.

26:23.709 --> 26:24.835
[mouths]

26:25.919 --> 26:27.588
[laughing]

26:29.047 --> 26:32.468
Hey, did you know
we're not in a union anymore?

26:34.137 --> 26:36.514
- Sorry, what?
- Now, come on, this is serious.

26:36.597 --> 26:40.184
I called our union rep this morning
to ask about my medical plan.

26:40.268 --> 26:43.229
She says we're not in a union anymore,
not since MCC took over.

26:43.312 --> 26:44.355
Those motherfuckers.

26:44.438 --> 26:46.815
I gotta reiterate.
I don't give a single shit about this.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.318
Look, even if you
don't got kids to support,

26:49.402 --> 26:51.445
you can't tell me that
you don't care about the money.

26:51.529 --> 26:54.240
Crazy thing happened.
Uh, a couple months ago,

26:54.323 --> 26:56.950
this dude in a sharp suit
shows up at my front door,

26:57.034 --> 26:59.077
says I'm sitting on valuable land.

26:59.162 --> 27:01.830
They traced oil deposits or some shit
to right underneath my house.

27:01.914 --> 27:04.292
Asked me if I mind them
coming in and digging.

27:04.375 --> 27:07.920
Says they'll compensate me for my time.
And I say, "Sure, I don't give a shit."

27:08.003 --> 27:09.672
And now, what do you know?

27:09.755 --> 27:12.633
These government checks start showing up
in my mailbox every week or so,

27:12.716 --> 27:14.427
so, uh, I'm pretty set.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.679
You know, my cousin said that

27:16.762 --> 27:19.890
he bought H off your brother-in-law
a couple weeks back.

27:20.891 --> 27:22.560
You don't know nothing about that, do you?

27:24.937 --> 27:26.772
[mouths] Nah.

27:28.816 --> 27:31.569
My last name is Ginsberg,
for fuck's sake.

27:31.652 --> 27:32.653
And?

27:32.736 --> 27:34.780
Okay, my Hebrew name
is Shayna Malka.

27:34.863 --> 27:36.949
- Huh?
- Shayna Malka?

27:37.032 --> 27:39.827
I was Bat Mitzvahed at Temple Beth Israel,
and at the party,

27:39.910 --> 27:43.497
I sang Wind Beneath My Wings
backed by a full orchestra.

27:43.581 --> 27:44.582
Killed it, by the way.

27:44.665 --> 27:46.292
But hold up though, shawty.

27:46.375 --> 27:49.545
You got blonde hair and blue eyes.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.214
You know what I'm saying?

27:51.297 --> 27:53.674
That combo don't show up much with y'all,
from what I hear.

27:53.757 --> 27:57.636
Okay, so clearly you're already an expert.
Okay, I'm gonna go sit at another table.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.012
No, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

27:59.096 --> 28:01.557
No, now, I'm just assessin' over here.
You know what I'm sayin'?

28:01.640 --> 28:04.643
I'm offering hella commissary
for some Jew 411,

28:04.727 --> 28:07.145
so I'm gonna need to know
I'm getting my candy's worth, okay?

28:07.230 --> 28:09.064
Now, calm the fuck down.

28:09.147 --> 28:11.567
Next question.
What you in here for?

28:13.569 --> 28:14.570
Money laundering.

28:14.653 --> 28:17.281
Okay, now we talkin'.

28:20.075 --> 28:21.744
[buzzing]

28:37.385 --> 28:38.886
How you doing, sweet pea?

28:38.969 --> 28:40.095
[whimpering]

28:40.178 --> 28:41.680
It's good to see you, Mommy.

28:41.764 --> 28:43.140
[sighs heavily]

28:43.224 --> 28:44.600
You look so pale, honey.

28:44.683 --> 28:46.477
- Are you all right?
- Mmm.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.147
Mommy, she hasn't written me back.

28:50.773 --> 28:54.860
I write her every day,
tell her how much I love her.

28:54.943 --> 28:57.613
I write lists of names for the baby,

28:57.696 --> 29:01.116
compose short stories about
the future of our relationship,

29:01.199 --> 29:04.077
remind her of other star-crossed lovers
throughout history

29:04.161 --> 29:06.664
who have overcome great obstacles
to be together,

29:06.747 --> 29:11.335
Romeo and Juliet, Lolita and the old guy,
Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.

29:11.419 --> 29:13.796
Honey, none of those couples
ended up together.

29:13.879 --> 29:15.756
I love her, Mommy.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.341
[inhales sharply]

29:17.425 --> 29:18.426
I love her.

29:18.509 --> 29:19.885
I know you do.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.929
I was not a rapist...

29:22.012 --> 29:23.013
with her.

29:24.265 --> 29:26.850
We made love.

29:26.934 --> 29:30.396
"Guard, prisoner,"
they're just words.

29:30.479 --> 29:32.815
I need to get out of here
and claim my family.

29:32.898 --> 29:34.567
George, George.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.193
You're right.

29:36.277 --> 29:37.320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:39.237 --> 29:43.951
All "me, me, me" again, right?
How are you?

29:44.952 --> 29:48.581
George, I have
some difficult news for you,

29:48.664 --> 29:53.210
and I need you to promise me that
you are going to take a deep breath

29:53.294 --> 29:55.463
and try to have an appropriate response,

29:55.546 --> 29:57.047
just like we always used to practice.

29:57.130 --> 29:58.341
- Oh, my God.
- All right?

29:58.424 --> 29:59.717
You're sick.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.927
You have cancer, breast cancer.
Is it in the stomach?

30:02.010 --> 30:04.972
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- No, no, George, George.

30:05.806 --> 30:08.434
No, I'm healthy. I'm healthy.

30:08.517 --> 30:11.144
Come on, please, honey,
it's okay. Just deep breaths.

30:11.228 --> 30:12.563
[breathing deeply]

30:12.646 --> 30:13.689
You're...

30:13.772 --> 30:16.274
You're healthy.

30:16.359 --> 30:18.444
That's good.

30:20.821 --> 30:22.155
It's not your baby.

30:24.575 --> 30:25.576
What?

30:25.659 --> 30:30.247
Dayanara's baby, it's not yours.
I am so, so sorry, honey.

30:31.749 --> 30:33.751
I don't understand.

30:33.834 --> 30:36.294
I went to see her. I thought that...

30:37.630 --> 30:40.383
I don't know what I thought...
That I could offer you a hopeful future

30:40.466 --> 30:44.219
or that I could take care of your child
until you could.

30:46.304 --> 30:47.305
But it is mine.

30:47.390 --> 30:50.601
No, honey,
she told me so herself.

30:50.684 --> 30:52.310
We made the love.

30:52.395 --> 30:55.523
Yes, well, apparently,
you weren't the only one.

30:55.606 --> 30:57.483
No...

30:57.566 --> 30:58.567
that baby is mine.

30:59.485 --> 31:00.486
I'm gonna be a father.

31:00.569 --> 31:02.112
- [sighs]
- I'm gonna get out of here.

31:02.195 --> 31:04.072
I'm gonna be the best father
anybody could ever want.

31:04.156 --> 31:06.909
George, why don't you
focus on the positive?

31:06.992 --> 31:09.537
If it's not yours, maybe we can
get you out of here a lot faster...

31:09.620 --> 31:15.208
That woman and the baby she's carrying
are the only things that keep me alive.

31:19.296 --> 31:22.132
They're gonna change my life, Mommy.

31:22.215 --> 31:25.928
They're gonna make me into the man
I always knew I could be...

31:26.011 --> 31:28.138
the man you said I could be.

31:33.811 --> 31:36.313
Okay, sweet pea. Okay.

31:38.566 --> 31:41.444
He had these beady little eyes,

31:41.527 --> 31:46.323
like they were glued onto his face
like a koala, you know?

31:46.407 --> 31:49.284
I thought I could get past it,
first couple of times.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.203
[Crazy Eyes] Well, koalas are scary.

31:51.286 --> 31:55.791
Anyhoo, I took him right off
my visitors list after today.

31:55.874 --> 31:58.919
[chuckles] You are a real slut.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.631
Suzanne... that is not nice.

32:02.715 --> 32:05.676
But you seemed so experienced.

32:05.759 --> 32:09.387
Well, yes...
I guess, I suppose I...

32:09.472 --> 32:10.556
In a way, I...

32:10.639 --> 32:13.892
But you... It is not nice
to call somebody a slut.

32:14.602 --> 32:19.940
Then why do girls like it
when men call them sluts during sex?

32:20.023 --> 32:23.736
Or bitches?
Or dirty whores who love cum?

32:23.819 --> 32:27.364
[chuckles] Oh, dear,
well, that is a complicated question.

32:27.448 --> 32:29.492
Yeah, I don't understand things sometimes.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.409
- Yeah, I know.
- Like sex.

32:31.494 --> 32:32.495
Mmm.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.372
I don't understand sex.

32:39.042 --> 32:41.962
- But you write...
- No, I made it up.

32:42.045 --> 32:45.257
From my imagination brain
influenced by the stuff I read.

32:45.340 --> 32:46.967
It's not real.

32:48.176 --> 32:52.430
It's going to maybe be real,
and I don't think I can do it.

32:52.515 --> 32:53.766
I don't know how.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.101
Oh...

32:56.184 --> 32:57.435
there's a girl.

32:58.896 --> 33:01.690
- Hon, have you not...
- No.

33:01.774 --> 33:03.275
- Nothing?
- No.

33:03.358 --> 33:05.110
- Ever?
- No.

33:06.153 --> 33:07.195
[sighs]

33:07.279 --> 33:08.280
Well...

33:09.782 --> 33:12.868
I was really scared
my first time, too.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.286
I was 14.

33:14.369 --> 33:17.330
I was in the basement
at Joey Giordano's house.

33:17.414 --> 33:18.541
- [sighs sharply]
- [exclaims]

33:19.542 --> 33:25.005
Listen, your first time... it's gonna be
messy and bumbling and weird.

33:25.088 --> 33:26.507
Everyone's is.

33:26.590 --> 33:28.300
What do I do with my hands?

33:30.093 --> 33:31.804
Put 'em inside her.

33:33.556 --> 33:36.141
Brussels sprouts, ugh, for real?

33:36.224 --> 33:39.186
I know, but you can't
get away from them these days.

33:39.269 --> 33:40.270
Huh.

33:41.188 --> 33:44.983
- And people actually like them?
- Yeah, it's, like, hip or something.

33:45.067 --> 33:48.028
You know, sometimes I'm glad
I'm not out in the world,

33:48.111 --> 33:49.738
'cause it seems awful confusing.

33:49.822 --> 33:51.448
It is.

33:52.074 --> 33:53.742
Yeah. [chuckles nervously]

33:57.705 --> 33:58.831
Hey, I don't know about you,

33:58.914 --> 34:02.626
but I'm craving ice cream,
something fierce.

34:02.710 --> 34:06.714
And, um... we have some time
before we gotta get back,

34:06.797 --> 34:07.798
if you wanna stop.

34:10.592 --> 34:11.594
Pull over.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.347
Okay.

34:21.311 --> 34:22.312
[Pennsatucky clears throat]

34:23.230 --> 34:24.648
You don't have to do that.

34:26.274 --> 34:27.943
- Do what?
- Anything.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.445
You don't have to do anything.

34:30.527 --> 34:34.491
We're friends now.
I like you.

34:35.659 --> 34:39.371
If you want ice cream,
you just ask, okay?

34:39.454 --> 34:40.581
Okay.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.042
What's your favorite flavor?

34:44.793 --> 34:49.882
Mmm, my favorite flavor is
double fudge chocolate.

34:50.924 --> 34:55.012
Though I've never been able to understand
how you could take chocolate, right,

34:55.094 --> 34:56.597
and then double it...

34:56.679 --> 34:59.432
[chuckles] and then fudge it.

34:59.516 --> 35:01.476
It is so delicious. What's yours?

35:02.185 --> 35:03.729
Anything with rainbow sprinkles.

35:03.812 --> 35:05.230
[laughing]

35:05.313 --> 35:06.314
Nice.

35:06.398 --> 35:09.401
- You sure we have time?
- We'll be all right.

35:09.484 --> 35:12.445
- Let's get some ice cream.
- All right.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.239
[man on TV] You like that,
you dirty slut?

35:14.322 --> 35:16.992
Yes, yeah.

35:17.075 --> 35:18.201
[woman moaning]

35:18.911 --> 35:20.412
[Pennsatucky chuckles]

35:20.495 --> 35:23.874
She makes the funniest sounds.
Why is she smiling?

35:23.957 --> 35:28.295
Partly 'cause it's her job to,
like a Walmart greeter,

35:28.378 --> 35:31.131
and partly 'cause she likes it.

35:32.049 --> 35:33.591
I don't get it.

35:34.927 --> 35:38.931
Why is he about to
put his mouth on her... her vagina?

35:39.014 --> 35:40.557
That's so gross!

35:40.641 --> 35:42.768
Take this perverted shit out of here.

35:42.851 --> 35:45.103
- It's not perverted.
- Yeah, it is.

35:45.187 --> 35:47.189
- [chuckles]
- Hey.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.273
- Hmm?
- Stand up.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.984
Where are we going?

35:52.235 --> 35:53.528
Stand up.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.450
I'm standing up.

36:04.915 --> 36:06.499
Come here.

36:06.583 --> 36:07.710
Okay.

36:25.352 --> 36:26.603
[Pennsatucky chuckles]

36:34.486 --> 36:36.196
No...

36:36.279 --> 36:37.280
don't do that.

36:37.364 --> 36:39.157
Why not?

36:39.241 --> 36:41.910
You're slow as molasses,
come on.

36:57.885 --> 36:59.177
You look beautiful.

37:02.014 --> 37:03.348
Thank you.

37:04.641 --> 37:05.976
Come here.

37:18.781 --> 37:19.782
Get into bed.

37:41.011 --> 37:42.720
What are you doing?

37:46.599 --> 37:48.977
I don't know if I like... that.

37:49.061 --> 37:50.854
Oh, Jesus.

37:51.897 --> 37:53.106
[woman on TV] Oh, yeah!

37:53.190 --> 37:55.984
Are you doing that porn shit
on me right now?

37:56.944 --> 38:00.322
No, ma'am... just taking care of you.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.659
I'm not gonna smile at you.

38:04.742 --> 38:06.036
[chuckles]

38:06.119 --> 38:09.706
You don't gotta smile. Just trust me.

38:12.918 --> 38:15.003
[woman on TV moaning]

38:15.087 --> 38:17.672
My God. Oh, my God.

38:20.342 --> 38:22.135
Is this what they write songs about?

38:22.219 --> 38:23.428
- Shh.
- [moaning]

38:23.511 --> 38:25.013
Just relax.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.515
- Yeah, I'm relaxed.
- Relax, baby.

38:27.599 --> 38:28.851
[continues moaning]

38:31.561 --> 38:33.688
Fuck, mmm, yes.

38:33.771 --> 38:34.982
[both laughing]

38:35.732 --> 38:37.818
Who are you, you magical man?

38:37.901 --> 38:38.986
[laughing]

38:42.114 --> 38:43.698
Oh, my God.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.701
Morello, what is that, like, Sicilian?

38:46.784 --> 38:48.871
Oh, I'm not sure.
[chuckles]

38:48.954 --> 38:50.580
It's a cherry.

38:50.663 --> 38:51.874
I know that.

38:51.957 --> 38:54.709
It's Morello cherries.
You ever heard of those?

38:55.627 --> 38:57.504
Well, my nonno used to say to me,

38:57.587 --> 39:02.634
"Oh, Lorna, I wanna squeeze you
till the cherry juice runs out."

39:03.468 --> 39:05.178
That's fucking creepy.

39:05.262 --> 39:07.139
[laughing]

39:07.222 --> 39:08.223
He was.

39:08.306 --> 39:10.558
I guess all Italian grandparents
sort of are.

39:10.642 --> 39:11.894
You know, you got the...

39:11.977 --> 39:15.063
you got the cheek pinching
and the kissing and whatnot.

39:15.147 --> 39:16.773
Yeah, yeah.

39:16.857 --> 39:20.568
I was beginning to think
it was all men, honestly.

39:22.445 --> 39:25.240
God, Lorna, you are
the most beautiful woman

39:25.323 --> 39:26.366
I have ever seen.

39:27.659 --> 39:28.743
Get out of here.

39:28.826 --> 39:30.370
I'm serious.

39:30.453 --> 39:33.290
Now, you know, I'm gonna
deny saying that to my friends.

39:33.373 --> 39:35.125
You know, I can't have them
thinking I'm a pussy.

39:37.335 --> 39:39.379
- I'm kidding, right? I'm kidding.
- Right, right, I get it.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.714
- I'm fucking with you.
- [laughing] You're crazy.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.217
Oh, Vince.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.094
Vinnie... Can I call you Vinnie?

39:47.554 --> 39:50.933
Vinnie, that is something
that I really like about you.

39:51.016 --> 39:53.393
'Cause you are sensitive,
but you're also strong.

39:54.186 --> 39:55.187
Yeah.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.981
There's something about
a man in a gold chain

39:58.065 --> 40:00.192
that makes me feel...
[inhales deeply]

40:00.275 --> 40:02.360
Protected.

40:04.071 --> 40:07.157
I'd always protect you,
Lorna, from anything.

40:12.037 --> 40:14.957
Well, there is this one guy.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.874
He's been saying creepy things,

40:16.959 --> 40:23.673
and sending me these
horrible, disgusting letters...

40:23.756 --> 40:27.677
telling me about
what he wants to do to me...

40:27.760 --> 40:31.264
making me feel
very, very un-ladylike.

40:32.640 --> 40:36.394
What's his name, hmm? Where does he live?
I'll kill this fucking prick.

40:36.478 --> 40:40.357
No, no, oh, I couldn't.
I mean, you're so sweet.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.359
What's his fucking name, Lorna?

40:47.489 --> 40:48.531
Psst.

40:48.615 --> 40:50.742
- You got yours on?
- Hell, yeah.

40:50.825 --> 40:53.120
I feel all sexy
underneath my khakis now.

40:53.203 --> 40:55.956
You feel all sexy for who, O'Neill?

40:57.874 --> 40:59.376
I feel like I got a secret, you know?

40:59.459 --> 41:03.546
Like we're a part of this secret club
that no one knows about.

41:03.630 --> 41:04.631
I feel cool.

41:05.298 --> 41:08.343
Oh, my God, you just said that
and my nipples got, like, super hard.

41:08.426 --> 41:10.053
[both laughing]

41:10.137 --> 41:11.179
[mouths] Bye.

41:12.305 --> 41:13.390
Bye.

41:21.398 --> 41:22.399
Where'd you get those?

41:22.482 --> 41:24.234
Show me your tits, and I'll tell ya.

41:24.985 --> 41:26.694
I'm one of you.

41:28.405 --> 41:32.492
Dear Chapman, thank you...

41:32.575 --> 41:35.370
thank you for the wonderful gift
of new jerk-off material

41:35.453 --> 41:37.039
that you have bestowed upon me.

41:37.122 --> 41:40.167
She's got everyone doing it?
Even old people?

41:40.250 --> 41:42.794
Hey, I still have a vagine, don't I?

41:42.877 --> 41:47.632
If we're all wearing them,
Chapman's gotta be making a killing.

41:47.715 --> 41:50.260
Well, I don't know
what kids are into these days,

41:50.343 --> 41:53.888
but people can't be spending
more than a couple of bucks

41:53.971 --> 41:56.724
for dirty underwear, can they?

41:56.808 --> 41:58.310
Got a friend says
she's seen it on the Internet

41:58.393 --> 41:59.519
for, like, 70 bucks a pop.

41:59.894 --> 42:00.937
Hmm.

42:01.021 --> 42:04.107
Holy shit, that's a whole lot of moolah.

42:04.191 --> 42:05.400
Yeah...

42:05.483 --> 42:07.652
and all we're getting is flavor packs?

42:09.154 --> 42:10.780
[chuckling]

42:10.863 --> 42:11.906
Oh, no.

42:21.833 --> 42:24.627
[sighs deeply]

42:24.711 --> 42:26.504
[exhales deeply]

43:00.330 --> 43:03.083
[Leanne] Stop being nervous.
This is our right.

43:03.166 --> 43:07.420
Our Norma-given right,
no matter what Caputo says.

43:07.504 --> 43:08.546
Gina, go.

43:10.465 --> 43:14.719
One person here is very bossy,
and I am very annoyed by her!

43:15.928 --> 43:17.054
Are you talking about me?

43:18.556 --> 43:20.308
Um, I didn't think we were
supposed to respond.

43:20.392 --> 43:21.893
She's clearly talking about me.

43:21.976 --> 43:24.854
And that's the problem, ain't it?

43:24.937 --> 43:26.439
I mean, this is supposed
to be about Norma.

43:26.523 --> 43:27.649
Now it's all about you.

43:27.732 --> 43:29.359
Someone has to
keep us on mission.

43:29.442 --> 43:30.527
We have a mission?

43:30.610 --> 43:32.195
I mean, nobody's here for no mission.

43:32.279 --> 43:34.656
Look, we don't need to be
yelling our complaints

43:34.739 --> 43:37.534
or cleansing our organs,
whatever the fuck that means.

43:37.617 --> 43:41.788
I mean, we're here for Norma,
'cause she makes us feel seen.

43:44.874 --> 43:46.626
Norma makes me feel like I matter.

43:47.877 --> 43:50.004
Norma is my Jesus!

43:51.381 --> 43:53.175
Norma is my mother.

43:53.675 --> 43:55.177
Norma is my grandmother.

43:56.010 --> 43:57.679
Norma's my great-grandma.

43:57.762 --> 44:00.307
[Leanne] Norma is...

44:00.390 --> 44:02.058
all of my relatives combined.

44:02.142 --> 44:03.518
[Angie] Norma is me.

44:03.601 --> 44:04.602
- Oh!
- [Poussey] Oh, fuck.

44:04.686 --> 44:08.148
All right, ladies, you were warned.
That's it. Work duty, now.

44:15.822 --> 44:17.699
Don't say it.

44:18.866 --> 44:19.951
Don't say what?

44:20.034 --> 44:22.119
I know what you're thinking.

44:22.204 --> 44:26.333
I really wasn't gonna say anything.
I'm taking the high road.

44:26.416 --> 44:27.875
[scoffs]

44:27.959 --> 44:31.171
I told you.
She thinks she's better than us.

44:31.254 --> 44:33.548
We're just different, obviously.

44:34.216 --> 44:37.385
"Obviously"?
Oh, that is just condescending.

44:38.094 --> 44:43.308
Okay, it's hard to avoid condescension
when you're literally below me right now.

44:43.391 --> 44:45.185
[chuckles]

44:45.268 --> 44:46.603
You're a fucking bitch.

44:46.686 --> 44:48.355
[scoffs]

44:48.438 --> 44:50.648
You know what? Fine.

44:51.691 --> 44:53.150
Maybe I am better than you.

44:54.277 --> 44:56.613
And I'm not apologizing for it.

45:01.493 --> 45:04.787
You rub it like this to break down
the cellulose structure.

45:04.871 --> 45:07.624
See how the leaves
are getting darker and less waxy?

45:07.707 --> 45:09.125
- That's what you want.
- [chuckles]

45:09.208 --> 45:11.503
Shit, if you're giving out free massages,
I'll take one.

45:12.712 --> 45:14.381
[Red] We'll set this aside for dinner.

45:14.464 --> 45:17.592
Now, ratatouille.

45:17.675 --> 45:19.927
- Like the rat movie?
- [chuckles]

45:20.011 --> 45:22.889
[Blanca] Charlotte's Web?
[Maritza] No, like Fievel Goes West.

45:22.972 --> 45:25.767
[Blanca] Uh, no,
I think it's Stuart Little.

45:25.850 --> 45:26.934
[Maritza] American Tail.

45:27.018 --> 45:28.353
- What?
- With the mouse.

45:28.436 --> 45:30.730
With the cute little mouse.
He comes to America.

45:30.813 --> 45:31.814
Ooh.

45:31.898 --> 45:34.442
That is the smallest pan
I've ever seen.

45:34.526 --> 45:36.403
A small garden.

45:36.486 --> 45:38.655
Everyone grab a fork.
Careful, it's hot.

45:45.161 --> 45:46.704
- Mmm!
- Hmm!

45:46.788 --> 45:48.665
- Oh, my God.
- Good, yes?

45:48.748 --> 45:50.750
[chuckling]

45:50.833 --> 45:52.460
- I feel...
- Like a person.

45:52.544 --> 45:53.711
Exactly.

45:53.795 --> 45:56.130
- Hmm, not bad for a white lady.
- I do what I can.

45:58.049 --> 46:00.302
Now, I think I'm going to have
some of my own ratatouille.

46:00.385 --> 46:03.262
Give me a little taste
of this little masterpiece.

46:03.346 --> 46:04.889
[Blanca speaking Spanish]

46:04.972 --> 46:06.057
[Dayanara] I wanna taste this yellow one.

46:08.017 --> 46:09.436
- Hey, boss.
- [knocking on door]

46:09.519 --> 46:10.728
How you doing?

46:10.812 --> 46:12.355
Come in, Coates.

46:16.818 --> 46:18.069
Don't sit.

46:20.322 --> 46:22.949
Where were you
yesterday for count?

46:23.032 --> 46:26.911
You were on, but Kowalski said
he was short a man for the 4:00 p.m.

46:26.994 --> 46:27.995
Oh, well, I...

46:28.079 --> 46:30.332
Apparently, you missed it
twice last week, too.

46:31.458 --> 46:34.001
You know, I'm still getting the hang
of the schedule around here,

46:34.085 --> 46:35.378
and I was on van runs.

46:35.462 --> 46:37.839
You know what?
I don't even wanna hear it.

46:37.922 --> 46:40.174
Whatever bullshit excuse
you're about to give me.

46:40.257 --> 46:42.469
Consider yourself
on official probation.

46:43.386 --> 46:45.763
- Starting now.
- Okay.

46:49.351 --> 46:52.770
What, um...
what does that mean?

46:52.854 --> 46:56.315
It means get your shit together, Coates.
Stop fucking up or you're out of a job.

46:57.274 --> 46:58.818
Yes, sir.

47:03.948 --> 47:05.908
Thank you for seeing me today.

47:06.826 --> 47:08.119
Didn't think you'd be back.

47:08.202 --> 47:12.289
Yeah, well...
I feel invested.

47:12.374 --> 47:15.334
I don't know why.
It got nothing to do with you.

47:16.586 --> 47:18.671
I wanna adopt the baby, Daya.

47:18.755 --> 47:19.839
[scoffs]

47:21.716 --> 47:25.678
Why? Why would you wanna
adopt the baby? Still?

47:27.555 --> 47:30.600
You're in prison.
Your mother is in prison.

47:31.768 --> 47:32.977
[sighs]

47:33.770 --> 47:35.522
I have a good life,

47:35.605 --> 47:38.525
but it's been empty
for a really long time,

47:38.608 --> 47:41.444
especially since the boys
have left the house.

47:41.528 --> 47:43.195
I have space for a child.

47:44.363 --> 47:47.575
I don't see why
it shouldn't be yours...

47:48.785 --> 47:51.203
as long as that's something
you still want.

47:54.999 --> 47:58.335
I understand if you can't
give her to me anymore.

47:58.420 --> 47:59.421
Her?

47:59.504 --> 48:01.506
Oh, sorry.

48:01.589 --> 48:03.633
I know you don't know,
but ever since you said it,

48:03.716 --> 48:06.302
I just haven't been
able to shake the idea.

48:07.261 --> 48:09.263
You'll always be her mother, Dayanara,

48:09.346 --> 48:13.768
but I would be truly honored
to raise your daughter for you.

48:20.107 --> 48:21.192
[exhales deeply]

48:28.282 --> 48:29.784
[breathing deeply]

48:33.037 --> 48:34.080
Yes.

48:37.166 --> 48:38.835
Please take her.

48:41.253 --> 48:44.131
Take her and give her
the best life you can give her.

48:46.759 --> 48:47.802
I will.

48:50.012 --> 48:51.388
I promise.

48:57.604 --> 48:59.271
[reporter] We're here at
the downtown courthouse,

48:59.355 --> 49:01.983
where Judy King's sentencing hearing
has just been completed.

49:02.066 --> 49:03.526
Here we go.

49:04.652 --> 49:06.738
Hey, hey, hey,
move, move, move, move, move.

49:06.821 --> 49:09.448
Hey, what's up?
[laughing]

49:09.532 --> 49:12.243
- Oh, snap.
- Yo, did we miss it?

49:12.326 --> 49:14.370
Man, you think all these people
be sitting quiet up in here

49:14.453 --> 49:15.997
after they announce it?

49:16.080 --> 49:17.373
Nah, we good.

49:18.541 --> 49:21.127
Man, this whole Norma thing been
fucking up my sense of normalicy.

49:21.210 --> 49:24.255
- Mmm-mmm, it's "normalcy."
- I don't think any of them is right.

49:24.338 --> 49:26.173
Nah, it's definitely "normalicy."

49:26.257 --> 49:28.384
- Man, just say, "normal."
- Why don't y'all just look it up?

49:28.467 --> 49:30.052
Can't, ain't no dictionary.

49:30.136 --> 49:31.929
Yeah, so I'm gonna go ahead
and live in my reality,

49:32.013 --> 49:33.055
and you keep living in yours.

49:33.139 --> 49:34.390
- [Black Cindy] Shh.
- I missed you guys.

49:34.473 --> 49:36.100
- Okay, okay.
- [reporter] Here he is. Here he is.

49:36.183 --> 49:38.728
Do you have any details
on Judy King's placement, sir?

49:38.811 --> 49:39.896
- Litchfield.
- Litchfield.

49:39.979 --> 49:41.523
- Litchfield.
- [all] Litchfield.

49:41.606 --> 49:44.734
Knock it off! Knock it off!

49:44.817 --> 49:46.235
We'd like to know, sir.

49:46.318 --> 49:49.238
Ms. King will be serving her time
at the Alderson Correctional Facility.

49:49.321 --> 49:50.532
- [inmates groaning]
- [Taystee] What?

49:50.615 --> 49:51.991
- [Black Cindy] Wow!
- [Janae laughing]

49:52.074 --> 49:53.200
Are you kidding me?

49:53.284 --> 49:55.452
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, P.

49:55.537 --> 49:58.915
It's all right, man.
She probably a uppity bitch, anyhow.

49:58.998 --> 50:02.960
Tell me more about yourself
so you will be less mysterious,

50:03.044 --> 50:05.922
and I'll be less interested in you.

50:06.005 --> 50:09.216
That sounds like a raw deal for me.

50:09.300 --> 50:13.596
Why did you move here? Where did you live?
What is your family like?

50:13.680 --> 50:17.058
Well, my dad moved here
for a job in Philadelphia.

50:17.141 --> 50:18.768
I am an only child.

50:18.851 --> 50:22.354
And my folks moved back
to the mother ship a few years ago.

50:22.438 --> 50:23.940
Do you miss them?

50:24.023 --> 50:25.482
I do.

50:25.567 --> 50:26.693
[Alex] "I do"?

50:27.652 --> 50:28.945
I know we're all lesbians,

50:29.028 --> 50:30.863
but isn't it awfully soon
to be committing?

50:30.947 --> 50:33.950
Shut up, Alex.

50:34.033 --> 50:35.785
What? [chuckles]

50:35.868 --> 50:38.495
Can't turn around without seeing
Litchfield's newest butt-buddies.

50:38.580 --> 50:41.123
We were talking about Stella's family.

50:41.207 --> 50:42.834
[gasps] Oh...

50:42.917 --> 50:44.335
do tell.

50:44.418 --> 50:46.045
- Alex.
- [Alex] Come on...

50:46.128 --> 50:48.297
I'm just trying to hang out
with our new friend, Justin Bieber.

50:48.380 --> 50:50.174
Would you like to go speak privately?

50:50.257 --> 50:51.550
- I can leave.
- No.

50:52.468 --> 50:55.012
I'm sorry for interrupting.

50:55.096 --> 50:56.931
I'll give you guys some privacy

50:57.014 --> 50:59.100
so you can get to know
each other even better...

50:59.767 --> 51:01.060
and fuck.

51:02.144 --> 51:03.605
Jesus.

51:08.901 --> 51:10.695
You are so much more patient than I am.

51:10.778 --> 51:13.030
I would have cut that shit
loose months ago.

51:13.114 --> 51:14.156
Well...

51:15.074 --> 51:16.533
we've been through a lot together.

51:16.618 --> 51:19.286
A person shouldn't do something
out of obligation.

51:19.370 --> 51:21.580
If you're gonna do it,
do it 'cause you want it.

51:45.772 --> 51:46.939
[sighing]

51:51.443 --> 51:52.987
What the fuck are you looking at?

51:53.070 --> 51:54.071
Nothing.

51:54.989 --> 51:57.074
Please, just leave me alone.

51:57.158 --> 51:59.076
[laughing] Leave you alone?

51:59.952 --> 52:01.412
What?

52:01.495 --> 52:04.373
You've been following me
all over this fucking place...

52:04.456 --> 52:05.499
tracking me.

52:05.582 --> 52:07.919
- [sighing]
- And then lying about it.

52:08.002 --> 52:10.462
But, yeah, I'll leave you alone...

52:10.546 --> 52:12.757
- Hey.
- You crazy, psychotic bitch.

52:15.509 --> 52:17.178
I knew he fucking sent you.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.017
This ain't your bathroom.

52:24.601 --> 52:27.479
- [sighs] Ours is crowded.
- So?

52:27.563 --> 52:30.191
So, I needed a mirror,
and it's a free country.

52:30.274 --> 52:32.484
You're living in a different country
than me then.

52:33.695 --> 52:35.404
I don't wanna fight with you.

52:35.487 --> 52:38.490
Could've fooled me.
Keeping her son from her.

52:38.574 --> 52:39.616
[sighs]

52:42.244 --> 52:45.456
Excuse me, I got to wash my hands.

52:45.539 --> 52:48.250
You did not just push me.

52:48.334 --> 52:49.877
Oh, I did.

52:52.254 --> 52:53.422
- [grunts]
- [glass shatters]

52:54.048 --> 52:55.591
[gagging]

52:55.674 --> 52:56.801
No, no, please, please,
I'll tell you.

52:56.884 --> 52:58.219
I'll tell you everything.
I'll tell you everything.

52:58.302 --> 53:01.848
- The NSA, it's been infiltrated.
- What?

53:01.931 --> 53:04.183
You have no idea who you're messing with.

53:04.266 --> 53:05.309
No?

53:05.392 --> 53:06.936
Aren't you the one
that took Benny away from me,

53:07.019 --> 53:08.270
- even when he didn't do nothing?
- Mmm-hmm.

53:08.354 --> 53:10.231
You are trippin'.

53:10.314 --> 53:11.774
I am mothering.

53:11.858 --> 53:13.692
And I'm a ferocious,
pissed-off, real mother,

53:13.776 --> 53:16.445
but you wouldn't know
nothing about that, would you? Nah.

53:16.528 --> 53:18.030
[chuckles]

53:18.114 --> 53:20.449
'Cause you ain't nothing real.

53:24.203 --> 53:26.122
- Gloria, are you okay?
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

53:26.205 --> 53:28.082
Get the fuck away from her!

53:28.165 --> 53:29.708
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- [grunting]

53:29.792 --> 53:32.962
This whole place is completely bugged.

53:33.045 --> 53:35.757
They've been gathering
information on me

53:35.840 --> 53:40.052
and they're trying to frame me
for treason and for terrorism.

53:42.221 --> 53:43.264
[mumbles]

53:43.347 --> 53:44.348
The NSA?

53:44.431 --> 53:47.101
Yeah, so please, help me. Please, help me.

53:48.060 --> 53:50.354
Please, I know...
I know you're one of 'em.

53:50.437 --> 53:52.398
I know who you are.

53:55.151 --> 53:57.528
Hey, I'll work with you, okay?

54:00.072 --> 54:01.073
Shit.

54:01.157 --> 54:02.158
[groaning]

54:02.992 --> 54:04.118
Shit.

54:17.298 --> 54:18.507
[knocking on door]

54:24.263 --> 54:26.765
- You Christopher?
- Yeah, what's going on?

54:26.849 --> 54:29.060
So you think it's cool to bother
a nice, respectable girl,

54:29.143 --> 54:31.020
you sick son of a bitch, huh?

54:31.103 --> 54:32.980
You fucking prick!

54:33.064 --> 54:35.524
- [Christopher] Who the fuck are you?
- Get in here! Get this fucking guy!

54:35.607 --> 54:37.193
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Fucking prick.

54:37.276 --> 54:39.070
- You fucking jerk.
- Help!

54:39.153 --> 54:40.529
[rock music playing]

54:44.741 --> 54:47.119
- No, ten more minutes.
- No, no, no, no, no.

54:48.996 --> 54:50.706
Ten more minutes, please.

54:53.375 --> 54:55.002
My dad said I gotta
be packed by the morning.

54:56.587 --> 54:59.966
This place is gonna be so stupid
when you're gone.

55:00.049 --> 55:02.551
- No, it won't.
- Yeah, it will.

55:02.634 --> 55:03.928
How far is Wyoming?

55:04.846 --> 55:06.097
Far.

55:06.180 --> 55:09.141
Take me with you... please?

55:09.225 --> 55:10.642
I wish I could.

55:10.726 --> 55:12.728
[sighing]

55:24.448 --> 55:26.575
Hey, wait, come here.

55:31.163 --> 55:32.581
I love you.

55:43.300 --> 55:45.594
And I love you, too.

55:45.677 --> 55:49.140
And I'm coming back for you...
all right?

55:57.648 --> 55:59.441
Bye.

56:25.259 --> 56:28.054
Hey, you're not gonna find
any yellow caffeine soda in there, cutie.

56:28.137 --> 56:29.972
I ain't looking for soda.

56:30.889 --> 56:32.849
That's too bad,
'cause I got some for you right here.

56:32.934 --> 56:34.143
Well, I don't do that no more.

56:34.226 --> 56:36.353
You know, I'm being nice,
bringing these for you

56:36.437 --> 56:38.647
'cause technically, you owe me.

56:38.730 --> 56:41.025
I don't owe you shit, Abe.

56:41.108 --> 56:42.568
And plus, I have a boyfriend now.

56:42.651 --> 56:44.903
Rumor has it
he ain't gonna be around no more

56:44.987 --> 56:46.197
'cause of his drunk daddy.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.906
Will you just leave me alone...

56:47.990 --> 56:50.034
- It's gonna be real fast.
- Abe, let me be.

56:50.117 --> 56:51.618
Might even take your mind off things.

56:51.702 --> 56:53.454
- Ow, Abe, leave me be.
- It's gonna be really fast.

56:53.537 --> 56:54.913
- Fuck your mama!
- Yeah, come on.

56:54.997 --> 56:56.707
- Fuck your mama, Abe.
- Come on. Come on.

56:56.790 --> 56:58.542
Abe...

56:58.625 --> 57:00.627
- Come on, it's gonna be real fast.
- I ain't even fucking wet.

57:00.711 --> 57:02.088
It's gonna be real fast.

57:02.171 --> 57:04.381
- [groaning]
- Just relax, just relax.

57:04.465 --> 57:07.593
Yeah, yeah.

57:07.676 --> 57:09.678
There, that's it.

57:10.887 --> 57:13.975
There's that place, Sweet Licks,
over there on Route 8.

57:14.058 --> 57:17.144
Maybe they have rainbow sprinkles.
We could try that out.

57:17.228 --> 57:18.479
I don't feel like it.

57:18.562 --> 57:20.064
What do you mean?

57:20.147 --> 57:22.733
If you ain't the type
that can eat ice cream every day,

57:22.816 --> 57:24.026
then I ain't interested.

57:24.110 --> 57:25.319
Don't touch me.

57:26.487 --> 57:28.990
Jeez, what got into your boxers today?

57:29.073 --> 57:30.199
I got in trouble.

57:30.282 --> 57:32.659
I missed count yesterday
'cause of our little detour.

57:32.743 --> 57:36.913
You told me we had enough time,
and I believed you.

57:38.332 --> 57:39.458
Sorry.

57:40.376 --> 57:41.877
I didn't realize you had to be back.

57:41.961 --> 57:43.629
Yeah, well, now I'm on probation.

57:43.712 --> 57:44.713
Oh, that's nothing.

57:44.796 --> 57:47.466
I can help you figure out
when you gotta be back for count.

57:47.549 --> 57:51.678
No, I don't want any more help from you.
All your help does is get me in trouble.

57:54.306 --> 57:55.849
Hey.

57:55.932 --> 57:57.643
- Come on.
- What do you want from me?

57:57.726 --> 57:58.935
- What? Nothing.
- This?

57:59.020 --> 58:01.147
- Is this what you want from me?
- No, no, don't...

58:01.230 --> 58:02.314
- This?
- No.

58:02.398 --> 58:05.609
[Coates] This is what you're asking for?
This is what you're begging for, isn't it?

58:05.692 --> 58:09.738
You just lay there, and keep still
and keep quiet. You keep quiet.

58:10.947 --> 58:12.491
[breathing heavily]

58:12.574 --> 58:15.494
This is what you wanted,
isn't it? Isn't it?

58:15.577 --> 58:18.205
This is what you asked for,
isn't it, Doggett?

58:18.289 --> 58:19.956
This is what you wanted, huh?

58:20.041 --> 58:22.126
This is what you asked for.

58:22.209 --> 58:24.378
Doggett, Doggett, Doggett.

58:24.461 --> 58:26.463
Oh, Doggett, Doggett.

58:26.547 --> 58:27.631
[mumbling]

58:30.342 --> 58:33.804
I love you, Doggett.
I love you, Doggett. Doggett.
