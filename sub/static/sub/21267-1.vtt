00:55.081 --> 00:58.441
She's not coming, son.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.041
She's never late.

01:03.321 --> 01:06.761
There's always a first.

01:08.081 --> 01:09.521
She'll be here, you'll see.

01:24.681 --> 01:27.801
- You were supposed to help us.
- I am helping.

01:28.481 --> 01:30.121
Yeah, right.

01:30.281 --> 01:32.361
But you're in luck.
It's a special day.

01:32.641 --> 01:34.721
What's special about it?

01:39.441 --> 01:41.761
Find out for yourself.

01:47.121 --> 01:49.281
You're close.

02:04.401 --> 02:06.521
You said you'd never marry.

02:06.801 --> 02:09.041
I lied.

TIPS FOR CHEATING

02:29.881 --> 02:31.521
That's it.

02:31.921 --> 02:35.281
Of course we will add some details,
just the finishing touch.

02:36.561 --> 02:39.681
I hope it looks
exactly as you pictured it.

02:39.961 --> 02:42.641
- It's perfect.
- Great.

02:43.081 --> 02:44.681
Excuse me for just a sec.

02:45.161 --> 02:47.241
I'm sorry. Good morning.

02:48.121 --> 02:49.481
Finally.

02:49.641 --> 02:52.041
I'm sorry. We just...

02:53.041 --> 02:54.721
We couldn't get out of bed.

02:54.961 --> 02:58.321
Force majeure, love in bloom.

02:58.681 --> 03:00.481
How about a double wedding tomorrow?

03:00.761 --> 03:03.281
I don't have the dress,
but we're considering it.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.961
What's there to consider?
Hey, Alex...

03:11.481 --> 03:13.761
- We lost him.
- Huh?

03:14.121 --> 03:18.161
Well... You go first, we will follow.

03:19.201 --> 03:21.761
Sounds cool, I want the car.

03:23.241 --> 03:25.321
Sure, honey...

03:26.841 --> 03:29.441
I'll take the metro. Or the bus.

03:29.721 --> 03:31.281
Thanks. Ciao.

03:31.521 --> 03:33.441
Bye.

03:38.081 --> 03:41.321
It's so pretty.
Really beautiful.

03:41.601 --> 03:43.721
Wait, stop right there.

03:48.321 --> 03:50.081
Wow.

03:50.321 --> 03:53.681
You're going to love the photo shoot
on the riverbanks.

03:55.561 --> 03:57.481
What's up?

03:57.761 --> 03:59.881
It's tomorrow.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.401
Tomorrow, that's right.

04:03.641 --> 04:06.321
Hey, girl.

04:07.961 --> 04:10.681
Don't you cry.

04:11.441 --> 04:14.321
You're pretty romantic
for a scientific mind.

04:38.441 --> 04:40.561
This is Anna from Opel OnStar,
what can I do for you?

04:40.801 --> 04:42.521
I'd like to report my car stolen.

04:42.801 --> 04:46.161
Please cut this jerk off,
I mean the ignition.

04:47.601 --> 04:49.001
Thanks.

04:50.321 --> 04:51.521
For?

04:51.721 --> 04:53.921
Moron, imbecile and a mean backstabber.

04:54.201 --> 04:57.561
I wish him eternal impotence
caused by severe syphilis.

04:58.081 --> 05:01.441
Wait a moment,
it's your feelings talking.

05:01.681 --> 05:03.641
They're not talking, they're screaming.
Write it down:

05:03.961 --> 05:07.001
May your life be a bed of nails,
may your ass be in pain forever...

05:07.281 --> 05:09.761
And shit all over yourself.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.321
You might add:

05:12.681 --> 05:16.041
Have a good read.
From Dominika Ferret. Or just Ferret.

05:18.121 --> 05:20.281
That is precisely why I am loyal
to my wife.

05:21.881 --> 05:25.481
- It's because you love her.
- Deeply.

05:29.121 --> 05:32.481
- Chill out, it's going to be fine.
- It's not. I blocked you, traitor.

05:32.841 --> 05:34.561
Ferret?

05:35.521 --> 05:38.401
I wanted to help this lady
with a problem...

05:38.601 --> 05:41.241
Problem? You've got a problem.
The police are coming.

05:41.601 --> 05:43.321
Make up some bullshit,
you're good at it.

05:43.601 --> 05:45.041
The police? Why?

05:45.361 --> 05:47.641
Here's a keepsake.

05:52.401 --> 05:54.801
Want a book?

05:59.841 --> 06:02.201
I'll be right there.

06:06.121 --> 06:08.921
You're not going to believe this,
I have to go to work.

06:10.121 --> 06:12.361
- Today?
- Yes, now, immediately.

06:12.761 --> 06:15.721
The system's down,
nobody can take care of it.

06:16.281 --> 06:18.721
Nobody in the whole world?

06:19.041 --> 06:21.921
Love, it's just around the corner.

06:22.281 --> 06:26.001
I'll be back before you notice I'm gone.

06:26.641 --> 06:29.161
Great, I'm marrying a workaholic.

06:30.321 --> 06:33.681
Oh, and who's the one
designing a website until dawn?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.001
Have you seen my phone?

06:36.881 --> 06:39.441
Found it!

06:40.041 --> 06:41.241
- Rafal...
- Yeah?

06:41.681 --> 06:44.281
Will you get ready on time?

06:45.441 --> 06:48.801
I don't have to be as beautiful...

06:49.161 --> 06:51.681
as you.

06:56.281 --> 06:58.881
- Come back soon.
- I will!

07:06.561 --> 07:08.481
Hello?

07:08.681 --> 07:10.841
Rafal is it you?

07:12.481 --> 07:15.841
Where are you?

07:46.161 --> 07:48.121
The system's down...

07:48.601 --> 07:50.961
Freaking liar.

08:25.841 --> 08:27.721
Oh no...

08:33.681 --> 08:36.081
You are not going to cry
because of him.

08:39.841 --> 08:42.681
How about leaving everything behind
and moving to Cuba?

08:43.760 --> 08:45.601
- Cuba?
- Yeah.

08:45.881 --> 08:49.241
It's a poor country
with no Internet access.

08:50.441 --> 08:52.601
Oh, then no.

08:56.761 --> 08:59.601
God damn it!
Do you want to kill me'?

09:00.121 --> 09:02.961
You're such a bore, no imagination.

09:31.841 --> 09:34.081
Hey, miss!

09:35.881 --> 09:38.241
Jesus...

09:38.801 --> 09:40.841
Is everything fine?

09:41.241 --> 09:43.161
Nothing is fine.

09:43.401 --> 09:45.041
Are you hurt?

09:45.241 --> 09:46.881
No, I think I tripped.

09:47.121 --> 09:50.041
Maybe we should take you home?

09:51.121 --> 09:54.721
No, I'll just stay here.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.601
Or I'll go for a walk.

09:58.001 --> 10:00.321
Are you sure?
You don't look so good.

10:01.841 --> 10:04.041
How rude!

10:04.321 --> 10:07.001
A freaking aesthete.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.481
This mad girl
almost got me into prison.

10:11.841 --> 10:15.201
Your mad driving
almost got you there.

10:18.721 --> 10:21.801
- You could use some phlegm at the wheel.
- You're phlegm.

10:22.041 --> 10:24.601
Why did I marry you in the first place?

10:26.521 --> 10:28.641
This is Opel OnStar,
what can I do for you?

10:28.881 --> 10:31.441
We had a little fender-bender,
please check the car.

10:31.761 --> 10:34.121
The car is fine.
Have a safe trip.

10:35.161 --> 10:37.601
Fasten your seatbelt.

10:47.201 --> 10:49.681
Poor girl.

10:52.921 --> 10:54.881
Join the club.

10:55.121 --> 10:58.041
The club? You too?

11:02.401 --> 11:04.601
Come live with me now.

11:05.641 --> 11:07.801
I could use company, too.

11:11.241 --> 11:13.361
But what next?

11:14.201 --> 11:17.041
You mean him or accommodation?

11:18.961 --> 11:21.081
See this?

11:21.921 --> 11:24.041
I'm such an idiot.

11:24.441 --> 11:26.241
I'm such an idiot.

11:26.481 --> 11:29.241
I'm done with him.
I'm done with all men.

11:33.801 --> 11:37.161
Almost all men cheat,
but you don't always find out.

11:38.801 --> 11:40.561
Better sooner than later.

11:40.761 --> 11:43.441
What would I do if I found out
after the wedding?

11:45.201 --> 11:46.921
Smart girl.

11:47.121 --> 11:51.361
How many women must be wondering
right now - is he cheating?

11:53.401 --> 11:57.761
Are these flowers a sign of love
or just a smokescreen?

12:02.201 --> 12:04.161
What?

12:06.081 --> 12:08.321
Tell me.

12:14.041 --> 12:17.881
We could become fidelity investigators.

12:23.081 --> 12:27.081
You know, a girl pays you
to seduce her guy.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.601
If he falls for you, bang!
Caught red handed.

12:31.281 --> 12:33.801
But, you mean...

12:34.161 --> 12:36.201
No...

12:36.481 --> 12:38.161
No, I mean...

12:38.961 --> 12:43.121
A kiss. General intent would do.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.481
I like it.

12:52.721 --> 12:55.681
So do I.

12:58.561 --> 13:01.361
No more scot-free shags.

14:29.561 --> 14:31.881
How much did we earn?

14:32.081 --> 14:34.161
Nice turnover, huh?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.361
I wouldn't give up your job just yet.

14:36.601 --> 14:38.961
Besides, we're doing it
to support a good cause.

14:39.881 --> 14:42.601
- And for...
- ... pleasure.

14:42.761 --> 14:44.961
That's it.

14:45.201 --> 14:48.041
Their faces are priceless.

14:48.441 --> 14:50.961
- Which sauce?
- What is it'?

14:51.361 --> 14:53.721
Vegan caesar salad.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.681
With sausages?

14:56.921 --> 14:59.441
With wieners.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.641
- Wow.
- What?

15:05.201 --> 15:07.921
Tips for Cheating.

15:08.361 --> 15:10.161
By Maciej Woltynski.

15:10.481 --> 15:14.721
The expert personal coach
writes about his love to his wife.

15:17.281 --> 15:19.841
Looks a bit like Krychowiak.

15:24.721 --> 15:27.161
He is the exception
that proves the rule.

15:27.401 --> 15:30.761
My friend went to him almost half naked.
He didn't even look at her.

15:31.921 --> 15:34.481
- Not Krychowiak.
- Blaszczykowski.

15:34.841 --> 15:38.801
- Living perfection.
- His wife is a lucky girl.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.201
- Tasty.
- You don't say.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.641
All this kissing makes me hungry.

15:48.921 --> 15:50.561
Good morning.

15:51.881 --> 15:54.441
- There you go. Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

16:06.161 --> 16:08.201
Hi there.

16:08.481 --> 16:10.801
Hi.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.801
I'm sorry about that scene in the car.

16:15.041 --> 16:19.161
Sometimes I forget you deserve...

16:20.161 --> 16:22.201
the best.

16:26.041 --> 16:28.721
No, I'm sorry, Mouse.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.921
Tada!

16:36.401 --> 16:38.841
Concert tickets.

16:46.521 --> 16:49.361
Real Cubans from Cuba.

16:50.481 --> 16:53.161
If you're happy, I'm happy.

16:53.641 --> 16:55.401
Thank you.

16:58.561 --> 17:00.961
I want us to be like we used to be.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.080
I will do my best, I promise.

17:08.401 --> 17:12.121
- Bye.
- Bye, have a nice day.

17:15.441 --> 17:18.800
I'm telling you, she hired
those fidelity investigators.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.001
It turned out he's all hanky-panky.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.601
That bastard.
Maybe I should investigate mine.

17:25.121 --> 17:28.481
- How much is it?
- Yes, how much?

17:29.841 --> 17:32.441
It's for a friend.

17:34.521 --> 17:38.321
Nobody can be trusted.
Woltynski, I would vouch for him.

17:39.521 --> 17:41.321
Beata, we are very sorry.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.121
Maybe this text is nothing,
maybe I'm mistaken.

17:47.361 --> 17:50.201
"Put on my favourite stockings.
On my way."

17:50.401 --> 17:52.361
This tells us everything.

17:54.161 --> 17:56.521
I want at-fault divorce.

17:57.481 --> 18:00.641
But the judge won't accept
one silly text as proof.

18:00.881 --> 18:03.121
I need more.

18:03.481 --> 18:05.601
Images that tell the story.

18:06.161 --> 18:07.881
I'll do it perfectly.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.001
- I'll take it.
- He's mine.

18:10.241 --> 18:11.921
- It's cut out for me.
- I'm doing it.

18:13.001 --> 18:15.481
You, you will seduce him.

18:16.161 --> 18:18.641
With pleasure.

18:19.201 --> 18:22.161
Tips for cheating.
He's such a sneak.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.761
He won't be an easy catch.
A miniskirt won't do.

18:25.961 --> 18:27.561
Find a way.

18:28.121 --> 18:30.641
You have to squeeze me in.

18:32.161 --> 18:34.801
Only he can help me get a grip.

18:35.601 --> 18:38.681
If I don't talk to him at once...

18:38.961 --> 18:41.361
I'll blow myself up in front of
the parliament. That's a useful death.

18:41.601 --> 18:44.041
All right, you'll be next.

18:44.521 --> 18:47.641
You need to wait 10 minutes.

18:48.201 --> 18:50.161
10 minutes.

18:50.561 --> 18:53.241
Maybe I should impersonate
a businessman?

18:57.241 --> 18:59.601
Be yourself.

19:00.801 --> 19:03.641
Ok, we'll work it out.

19:03.801 --> 19:06.281
Maybe a poet?

19:07.161 --> 19:09.961
Do you know how popular poets are?

19:11.041 --> 19:13.721
- Girls love poets.
- But they hate liars.

19:13.921 --> 19:17.281
Remember why you're here.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.161
- To learn to be myself.
- That's right.

19:20.481 --> 19:22.921
I'll think about it.

19:23.601 --> 19:26.321
- Could you sign it?
- For?

19:26.681 --> 19:29.321
Just sign it, I'll add something later.

19:39.681 --> 19:42.321
Hi, I'm back.

19:42.961 --> 19:46.321
I had this deal in Jamaica, you know.

19:47.601 --> 19:49.561
But my dreadlocks fell off, you know...

19:50.601 --> 19:53.361
Because of a Rasta man.
But it's all right now.

19:53.761 --> 19:56.521
- Hey, Rasta man, can I get inside?
- I'll call you back.

19:58.201 --> 20:01.361
- Bless you sister.
- I hate reggae. Excuse me.

20:01.721 --> 20:03.961
- I hate it too.
- I'm glad we understand each other.

20:04.521 --> 20:07.361
Didn't I...? No, I didn't. Bye...

20:13.281 --> 20:15.001
- Have a good read.
- Thank you.

20:16.441 --> 20:18.761
Sports style but still a great look.

20:19.001 --> 20:20.801
What else do you have?

20:21.081 --> 20:22.681
He is going straight to the gym.

20:22.961 --> 20:24.761
But what do I do to seduce him?

20:25.001 --> 20:26.841
He wouldn't tell, he's professional.

20:27.121 --> 20:29.641
I didn't want to overdo it.
But the gym is a good start.

20:30.001 --> 20:32.401
A tempting pal.

20:32.681 --> 20:34.961
That's it. Breasts won't do the trick.
Though...

20:35.921 --> 20:38.801
- What are you doing?
- With such resources one has to try!

20:48.241 --> 20:51.601
I told you, guidebooks are a goldmine.

20:52.761 --> 20:54.881
It's my first and last.

20:55.441 --> 20:58.921
Sometimes I begin to doubt coaching.
Maybe people can't be changed.

20:59.161 --> 21:02.521
But you can make money on that.
Like me. Like you.

21:03.601 --> 21:05.921
If only there was money in astronomy.
I'd sit and count stars.

21:06.721 --> 21:09.241
Well, wives have a way
of dragging you back to earth.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.441
Especially luxurious wives.

21:11.681 --> 21:15.201
- Beata is not a luxurious wife.
- Oh, please.

21:15.761 --> 21:18.241
You could feed an African village
for one of her handbags.

21:18.441 --> 21:20.241
You misjudge her.
She is...

21:21.521 --> 21:23.361
a wonderful woman.

21:23.801 --> 21:26.721
Enthusiasm score: 1/10.

21:26.961 --> 21:30.961
- We're going through a rough time.
- That's all right after 7 years.

21:32.161 --> 21:34.521
I wrote about it in "101 Reasons
for a Relationship Crisis".

21:34.881 --> 21:36.961
There may be a 1000 reasons.

21:37.241 --> 21:39.961
They'd never publish such a brick.
It has to be loo friendly.

21:40.201 --> 21:43.081
Where did your idealism go?
You are a philosopher.

21:43.281 --> 21:45.961
Yes, and I chose pragmatism.

21:47.321 --> 21:49.961
Do you know what will
revive your marriage?

21:50.761 --> 21:52.201
No.

21:52.481 --> 21:55.841
Neither do I.
But you need and impulse.

21:58.241 --> 21:59.961
Your reflex sucks.

22:00.241 --> 22:03.401
Is this your first time?

22:04.161 --> 22:07.081
You fight like a lady,
you'll fight with a lady.

22:07.321 --> 22:10.681
Kalina, come here.

22:11.761 --> 22:14.561
- I'll master dodging.
- You could use that.

22:17.641 --> 22:19.881
Meet your partner.

22:22.721 --> 22:24.841
Give me all you've got.

22:25.121 --> 22:26.841
With pleasure.

22:37.281 --> 22:39.401
Bad day?

22:39.761 --> 22:42.801
No. It's perfect.

22:47.081 --> 22:50.441
Maciek, look at me.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.521
Maciek?

22:54.761 --> 22:56.681
How the hell do you know my name?

22:57.041 --> 23:00.401
Maciek Woltynski, I read your book.

23:01.801 --> 23:03.961
About fidelity.

23:08.641 --> 23:10.681
- Kalina.
- Maciek.

23:11.241 --> 23:14.281
I'm sorry for the thrashing.
I got carried away.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.521
- I earned it.
- Did you?

23:16.841 --> 23:21.761
- I chose this sport.
- Maybe coffee? Or drinks next week?

23:22.601 --> 23:24.481
As an apology.

23:26.121 --> 23:29.481
No, there's no need. Thanks.
It happens.

23:29.881 --> 23:32.321
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:35.361 --> 23:37.481
Haven't we met?

23:38.601 --> 23:41.281
I don't recall.

23:42.161 --> 23:44.921
It was nice meeting you.

23:46.601 --> 23:49.361
I'm so sorry.

24:02.321 --> 24:04.521
Are you staying or leaving?

24:04.761 --> 24:07.761
- Which answer is better?
- Take a shot.

24:08.641 --> 24:11.361
- Staying.
- Suit yourself.

24:12.041 --> 24:13.721
And you?

24:14.721 --> 24:18.081
- Leaving.
- Then I'm leaving, too.

24:18.601 --> 24:20.721
What took you so long?

24:21.521 --> 24:23.721
I like to tease.

24:30.281 --> 24:33.641
I hit him so hard
I beat the romance out of his head.

24:33.921 --> 24:35.441
Literally.

24:37.681 --> 24:41.041
But he seems so...

24:41.801 --> 24:43.641
I don't know...

24:44.081 --> 24:46.081
so good-natured.

24:48.481 --> 24:50.201
With a slight ornithological problem.

24:50.401 --> 24:51.961
I know, a chick on his side.

24:52.161 --> 24:53.921
But...

24:55.121 --> 24:56.961
Hello?

24:58.761 --> 25:00.801
Yes, we're on it...

25:02.081 --> 25:03.881
Beata, please don't cry.

25:05.641 --> 25:07.401
We'll get him, for sure.

25:08.361 --> 25:11.361
You got the pills from the doctor?
Don't take anything on your own.

25:14.121 --> 25:17.481
You're welcome.
It's going to be fine.

25:19.401 --> 25:21.241
Take care.

25:23.881 --> 25:27.241
Good-natured, huh?

25:28.361 --> 25:30.441
I could have hit him stronger.

25:32.241 --> 25:34.761
Photography doesn't pay?

25:35.121 --> 25:37.281
Who orders it?

25:38.161 --> 25:40.081
It depends.

25:40.961 --> 25:44.321
Mostly white collars, corporats.

25:45.361 --> 25:47.521
And they like beetroot cake?

25:47.801 --> 25:49.041
Sure they do.

25:49.601 --> 25:51.361
Try it.

25:55.041 --> 25:57.081
It won't bite...

26:00.201 --> 26:02.041
And?

26:04.801 --> 26:07.921
- Not bad.
- You'll get somewhere.

26:08.161 --> 26:10.521
But I prefer sausages.

26:12.521 --> 26:15.881
Ok, but what do we do
about Maciek?

26:18.561 --> 26:21.921
Not really.
Kalina didn't work out.

26:23.121 --> 26:24.841
Maybe...

26:25.561 --> 26:27.681
Margarita or Bloody Mary?

26:28.321 --> 26:30.401
You said he doesn't party.

26:30.681 --> 26:33.121
He doesn't.

26:33.601 --> 26:36.961
But if his wife organised one...

26:38.121 --> 26:40.601
He'd have to come.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.161
Ferret, you're so smart.

26:44.481 --> 26:46.201
That's it.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.321
Keep an eye on these.

26:54.241 --> 26:55.841
I'm ready.

26:56.081 --> 26:59.441
I'm leaving. Don't feel embarrassed.

26:59.761 --> 27:01.721
He should be here soon.

27:09.681 --> 27:11.481
That's better.

27:11.721 --> 27:13.081
Good luck.

27:13.281 --> 27:15.641
I have a good feeling about this.

27:32.281 --> 27:34.001
Hi.

27:34.841 --> 27:38.201
May I ask why such a beautiful lady
is standing here alone?

27:38.681 --> 27:42.041
My friends will be here any moment.

27:45.401 --> 27:47.281
Injury?

27:48.161 --> 27:50.361
Afghanistan.

27:50.601 --> 27:53.521
Schrapnellmine.

27:54.961 --> 27:58.361
- It's awful.
- But bearable.

27:59.801 --> 28:03.161
- My name is Antek.
- Kalina.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.841
The image might lag
but you can see all the rooms.

28:07.081 --> 28:09.321
Almost all of them.

28:10.361 --> 28:12.921
That way I can keep an eye
on my employees even from home.

28:13.161 --> 28:15.081
This is the switch.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.921
What a great idea.

28:19.161 --> 28:21.441
But I don't think
anything will happen today.

28:21.641 --> 28:24.041
Your husband isn't that spontaneous.

28:24.561 --> 28:25.961
Tell me about it.

28:26.321 --> 28:27.961
But you can never tell.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.801
He backstabbed me more than once.

28:33.881 --> 28:35.801
Figure of speech.

28:36.241 --> 28:38.281
I see, I'll stay alert.

28:39.041 --> 28:41.321
Let's check his location.

28:41.961 --> 28:44.601
He's approaching.

28:44.881 --> 28:47.081
It's time to go.

29:05.121 --> 29:08.481
...and there's a swamp below.
A swamp in Afghanistan!

29:08.761 --> 29:10.321
But it's there.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.161
What a nuisance.

29:13.761 --> 29:15.961
...it surrounds you and you can't move.

29:16.281 --> 29:19.641
Try to move now.
See? You can't!

29:19.921 --> 29:22.481
He's ruining it.

29:26.561 --> 29:29.161
Excuse me, hello?

29:31.961 --> 29:33.441
I see.

29:34.681 --> 29:36.801
It's a soldier from Afghanistan.

29:37.521 --> 29:39.241
Experienced in battle.

29:39.681 --> 29:41.961
Listen, my friend's car broke down.

29:42.801 --> 29:43.841
She needs some pushing.

29:44.281 --> 29:46.801
- Where is it?
- That way.

29:48.441 --> 29:51.681
- There? - Yes.
- I'll be right back.

29:51.921 --> 29:54.521
Afghanistan was nothing
compared to Laos!

30:07.241 --> 30:10.601
- A soldier?
- I'm a man of many professions.

30:11.001 --> 30:12.361
What's broken?

30:12.881 --> 30:14.641
Get in.

30:34.081 --> 30:37.441
I'm not a master of zen.
Are we pushing or not?

30:38.561 --> 30:40.481
Sit and be quiet.

30:41.601 --> 30:43.161
Hi.

30:44.721 --> 30:48.081
- I didn't think we'd meet again.
- The way we met...

30:49.041 --> 30:51.521
- It's not destiny.
- I agree.

30:54.841 --> 30:57.561
Do you know anyone here?

30:58.721 --> 31:00.961
No, a friend invited me
and didn't show up.

31:02.241 --> 31:04.761
And that guy...

31:04.921 --> 31:06.481
He's a freak.

31:06.681 --> 31:08.041
How do you know?

31:08.321 --> 31:10.161
Intuition.

31:12.481 --> 31:16.241
It's nice talking to you
but I have to go.

31:17.801 --> 31:19.801
- Are you all right?
- I have to lie down.

31:20.881 --> 31:22.921
There's a sofa over there.

31:24.561 --> 31:26.841
Thank you.
It's my sugar.

31:27.201 --> 31:30.561
Sometimes it plummets.

31:35.481 --> 31:37.321
Breathe.

31:39.841 --> 31:43.201
- Do you need water?
- Yes... or no.

31:44.161 --> 31:45.841
I feel better.

31:46.161 --> 31:47.881
Breathe.

31:51.441 --> 31:55.321
Rest some more.
I really have to go now.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.801
Work.

31:58.841 --> 32:02.201
I got stood up by my catering partner.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.441
I need to find someone for Saturday.

32:06.041 --> 32:07.841
At short notice.

32:08.201 --> 32:10.281
You don't have to.

32:10.921 --> 32:13.081
I will do it.

32:15.321 --> 32:18.681
- You do catering?
- I'm a pro.

32:20.961 --> 32:24.841
- Don't get up.
- Breathing really helps.

32:27.481 --> 32:29.681
Thanks.

32:33.241 --> 32:35.561
My uncle is a Camaldolese monk.

32:36.081 --> 32:38.481
You'd feel great in a monastery.

32:44.321 --> 32:46.201
- No way.
- What?

32:49.241 --> 32:52.601
Your friend will be disappointed.
I'm afraid she hoped for more.

32:56.601 --> 32:59.961
- She can find another man.
- She'll have to.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.721
My name is Antek.

33:05.961 --> 33:08.201
- Ferret.
- That's nice.

33:09.841 --> 33:13.201
You do have this cute snout.

33:14.041 --> 33:15.961
It's my last name.

33:20.601 --> 33:23.161
How about hamburgers?

33:23.641 --> 33:26.961
It's a great idea.
You go, I'll wait here.

33:27.201 --> 33:28.521
What do you want?

33:28.761 --> 33:31.761
A millet burger with tofu and nettle.

33:31.881 --> 33:34.521
It's my favourite. I'm on my way.

33:35.401 --> 33:38.041
Wait, I'll make it easier for you.

33:39.721 --> 33:42.561
Opel OnStar, Kasia speaking.
How can I help you?

33:42.841 --> 33:47.841
Listen, we'd like two millet burgers
with tofu and nettle, double for me.

33:48.161 --> 33:51.481
Anything to drink'?
Take some kale juice, it's on me.

33:51.721 --> 33:53.761
- No...
- No drinks, that's all.

33:54.121 --> 33:56.721
You're looking for the closest
burger bar, let me check.

33:57.081 --> 34:00.081
A real banquet...

34:02.321 --> 34:04.961
It's my favourite book.

34:07.321 --> 34:09.801
It isn't worth the time.

34:11.321 --> 34:13.960
There's no room in my life
for poor literature.

34:30.081 --> 34:33.360
I'll be all alone in 15 minutes.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.561
It's been a while since we had breakfast
in the garden.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.400
True...

34:46.920 --> 34:50.281
But flies and bees
will get here any moment.

34:51.241 --> 34:54.601
You know how they terrify my.

34:56.721 --> 34:58.921
We can always go inside.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.481
Guests were looking for you yesterday.

35:05.681 --> 35:07.841
I had this terrible migraine.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.961
How was it?
Anything interesting?

35:12.761 --> 35:14.921
Nothing special.

35:15.961 --> 35:17.881
Did you have fun?

35:22.041 --> 35:24.521
Aren't you running late?

35:27.361 --> 35:30.201
You're right, I'm meeting
a client in a moment.

35:30.961 --> 35:33.641
That's a pity. Bye.

35:36.241 --> 35:38.481
Bye.

36:02.041 --> 36:03.881
There's progress.

36:04.281 --> 36:06.081
I think it's love.

36:06.801 --> 36:08.441
What?

36:08.761 --> 36:10.841
I fell in love with a vegan.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.201
Me, a carnivore.

36:14.241 --> 36:16.041
Do you think it could last?

36:16.321 --> 36:18.201
Did you tell her?

36:18.481 --> 36:22.281
I said I'm a vegan blogger
and a radical ecologist.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.721
But it's all connected, isn't it?

36:25.201 --> 36:27.881
So you want to build this relationship
on a lie.

36:28.081 --> 36:29.921
A bit, yes.

36:30.401 --> 36:34.881
Honesty is the key
to any healthy relationship.

36:35.081 --> 36:37.641
It's a great theory.
But in practice...

36:38.121 --> 36:40.721
Once I told a girl what I thought
about her and I ended up in plaster.

36:41.321 --> 36:42.801
Up to the waist.

36:43.281 --> 36:45.241
A lie got you fired.

36:45.441 --> 36:47.721
An unpolished lie.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.161
I'm a lousy salesman anyway.

36:50.521 --> 36:53.881
I'd like to be like you.

36:54.521 --> 36:57.641
Bullshit people with grace.
But I can't.

36:58.361 --> 37:02.161
I have to use my both hands
to earn a living.

37:03.001 --> 37:06.361
And what's wrong
with being a hand model?

37:08.561 --> 37:10.801
Poor recognisability.

37:11.681 --> 37:14.201
I blog about vegetables.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.361
I publish stuff every week.

37:16.641 --> 37:21.001
Right now I'm doing a French week.

37:21.321 --> 37:24.081
The world of vegetables is so rich...

37:24.401 --> 37:26.121
- We left cornsalad in the car.
- What?

37:26.361 --> 37:29.721
- Cornsalad.
- French corné-salaté, sure thing.

37:35.161 --> 37:37.321
Your corné-salaté.

37:38.561 --> 37:40.441
Thank you.

37:42.481 --> 37:44.481
Do you feel like peeling potatoes?

37:44.961 --> 37:47.881
That's a bit beneath me but...

37:48.521 --> 37:50.641
I'd do anything for you.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.881
After you.

38:04.601 --> 38:08.521
- Chop the squash.
- I didn't bring my racket.

38:11.761 --> 38:13.681
- Squash.
- Duh.

38:13.961 --> 38:16.441
- Cube cut it.
- Sure thing.

38:18.921 --> 38:22.281
... so once I chop it all up

38:22.961 --> 38:27.281
I take a photo
and publish it on the spot.

38:28.441 --> 38:31.121
- Hi.
- Hello.

38:31.761 --> 38:35.041
My new help, a vegan blogger.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.241
You mean Afghan?

38:38.561 --> 38:41.201
Let him shoot some good ideas.

38:41.601 --> 38:43.481
Fire away.

38:44.241 --> 38:46.721
- How's your leg?
- Recovering.

38:54.561 --> 38:56.241
Hello?

38:57.441 --> 38:59.241
Yes.

39:00.561 --> 39:02.241
I'll pass the phone to my colleague.

39:02.561 --> 39:04.961
A client, tomorrow at 7.

39:07.601 --> 39:10.321
So, you're free tomorrow at 7?

39:10.481 --> 39:12.561
No. Girl stuff.

39:13.241 --> 39:15.601
It's done.

39:16.361 --> 39:18.361
Anything else?

39:19.601 --> 39:22.041
They're too big.

39:22.441 --> 39:24.561
- You want them tiny?
- Yeah.

39:24.721 --> 39:26.881
I get it, it's for letcho.

39:34.441 --> 39:38.201
Dear ladies,
welcome to another workshop.

39:38.361 --> 39:43.281
Today I want you to share
what cheating means to you.

39:43.761 --> 39:47.681
What would you really
say to your ex partners?

39:48.561 --> 39:50.281
Come here.

39:50.601 --> 39:55.601
Steven, Tom, Kaz, he can take anything.

39:59.321 --> 40:01.681
Ilona, you go first.

40:02.561 --> 40:04.521
Thank you.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.721
Tomek...

40:14.441 --> 40:16.321
I'm sorry...

40:17.681 --> 40:21.881
You left me, but I accepted it.

40:24.041 --> 40:25.561
Be happy.

40:26.281 --> 40:30.481
You left me, but I wish you luck.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.721
Give llona a hand.

40:35.441 --> 40:37.881
- May I?
- Time for Marysia.

40:38.321 --> 40:40.121
Thank you.

40:41.961 --> 40:45.281
This was supposed to be the most
beautiful day in our lives.

40:46.721 --> 40:48.761
The day of our wedding.

40:49.561 --> 40:52.441
That's when I found out
you cheated on me.

40:52.681 --> 40:55.321
Could it get any worse?

40:56.961 --> 41:00.361
But I do get it, you had to do it.

41:00.641 --> 41:04.001
Wojtek, can you hear me?
I forgive you, darling.

41:04.641 --> 41:06.121
I forgive you.

41:06.401 --> 41:08.761
A big hand for Marysia.

41:09.241 --> 41:11.721
Wait a minute!

41:11.961 --> 41:14.121
So we're supposed to forgive everything?

41:14.401 --> 41:17.761
I get understanding and tolerance,

41:18.081 --> 41:20.241
but look around.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.801
Have some dignity!

41:23.801 --> 41:26.361
I will never forgive you!

41:26.921 --> 41:29.961
Bravo! It's your first step
towards a new life.

41:30.241 --> 41:32.441
Fantastic!

41:48.121 --> 41:50.761
Come on, time to go.

41:50.921 --> 41:53.801
Maciek!

41:54.801 --> 41:58.441
- Thanks for everything.
- Thank you. Bye.

41:59.161 --> 42:01.801
I'm sorry, I got carried away.

42:02.761 --> 42:06.121
No worries, he's used to it.

42:06.961 --> 42:09.361
It's not the first time
he lost his head.

42:12.681 --> 42:17.241
- Want to go for a walk?
- Sure.

42:18.721 --> 42:22.081
- I don't want to preach...
- But you will, anyway.

42:27.321 --> 42:29.961
Cheating can happen to anyone.

42:30.441 --> 42:32.521
It's not the end of the world.

42:32.721 --> 42:35.041
Strangely, it happens more often to men.

42:35.441 --> 42:37.761
See, you're angry, but that's all right.

42:39.241 --> 42:42.601
Do you want to be angry your whole life?

42:43.681 --> 42:46.281
Never trust again?

42:46.561 --> 42:49.241
I never said that.

42:50.201 --> 42:53.561
- But that's how you feel.
- What I feel doesn't count.

43:06.961 --> 43:09.601
It's all that counts.

43:23.921 --> 43:27.281
I'm sorry, we left everything there.

43:27.601 --> 43:30.961
- We have to go back.
- Yes, we do.

43:32.841 --> 43:36.201
- Thanks for the tip.
- You're welcome.

43:40.401 --> 43:42.441
I expected something more daring.

43:42.681 --> 43:44.921
The judge may questions this.

43:45.241 --> 43:47.521
This is a straightforward kiss.

43:48.001 --> 43:51.521
Like I said, he is a cheater.
And easy to catch.

43:51.921 --> 43:54.121
Are you sure he's cheating on you?

43:54.361 --> 43:56.961
Isn't that a silly question?

43:57.281 --> 43:59.681
So we're done here?

44:00.241 --> 44:02.201
I've been thinking...

44:02.361 --> 44:05.321
Maybe we could go a step further?

44:05.681 --> 44:08.281
A set of daring photos.

44:08.521 --> 44:10.521
Unassailable proof.

44:11.121 --> 44:14.481
- It's possible.
- Get down to work.

44:16.401 --> 44:19.041
- Good bye.
- Bye.

44:21.161 --> 44:24.761
- Will you tell me what is the matter?
- Something's off.

44:25.041 --> 44:27.401
- But what?
- I don't think he's...

44:27.961 --> 44:30.201
He's not the cheating type.

44:30.481 --> 44:34.441
Before the kiss
you thought he was a cheat.

44:34.761 --> 44:38.121
Now, after the kiss, you think he's not?
How is that logical?

44:39.961 --> 44:42.041
- Oh no...
- What?

44:42.201 --> 44:44.001
You fell for him.

44:44.201 --> 44:46.721
No way, stop this nonsense.

44:48.241 --> 44:50.801
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

44:56.081 --> 44:58.281
- Oh no!
- What?

44:58.641 --> 45:01.201
Oh no, you fell for him!

45:01.481 --> 45:04.841
Antek? I'd never fall
for that veggie liar.

45:05.081 --> 45:07.001
He thinks he's so convincing.

45:07.161 --> 45:09.361
So why do you answer?

45:09.761 --> 45:12.121
I like tormenting him.

45:12.401 --> 45:16.041
I wrote I'd like some St John's-bread.
I bet he'll check every bakery in town.

45:16.561 --> 45:19.281
Isn't that bread?

45:19.521 --> 45:22.201
No, it's a legume.

45:23.281 --> 45:26.641
You're so cruel!

45:27.961 --> 45:30.641
Catering for the next workshop is ready.

45:36.721 --> 45:40.081
Get these rags off you
and dress more...

45:40.921 --> 45:43.201
Or less.

45:44.801 --> 45:47.481
What's up?

45:49.041 --> 45:51.241
You're still hesitating.

45:53.081 --> 45:55.241
Honestly?

45:55.961 --> 45:58.361
Yes.

46:00.081 --> 46:02.401
Listen, if he's loyal, he's loyal.

46:02.801 --> 46:04.961
He'll keep his distance
and stay cold as ice.

46:05.241 --> 46:08.561
Then we tell Beata to go to hell. Deal?

46:24.281 --> 46:26.761
- Good morning.
- Where can I find Maciek?

46:27.041 --> 46:29.601
- He's not in.
- What do you mean?

46:30.041 --> 46:32.481
He was supposed
to sign the invoice.

46:33.641 --> 46:36.241
Tymek is here, he can help.

46:36.921 --> 46:40.281
Maciek is having personal issues.
I'm filling in for him.

46:41.401 --> 46:43.601
- I'm Tymoteusz Barylak.
- Kalina.

46:43.881 --> 46:47.321
Nice to meet you.
You should recognise me.

46:47.521 --> 46:48.961
I don't.

46:49.281 --> 46:53.641
I wrote many popular
guidebooks on relationships.

46:54.001 --> 46:59.241
I am also the author of a bestselling
series of books on miniature cacti.

46:59.521 --> 47:01.561
It was the most time consuming.

47:02.401 --> 47:05.241
Haven't we met?

47:07.081 --> 47:08.721
I'm not into botany.

47:09.121 --> 47:13.961
And as for his problems,
is it serious?

47:15.041 --> 47:17.841
- It can be solved surgically.
- What do you mean?

47:18.161 --> 47:21.961
An ulcer has to be removed,
one called Beata.

47:22.161 --> 47:26.641
I mentioned it in my brochure entitled
"Ulcer as a Metaphor of Marriage".

47:26.961 --> 47:29.201
It sounds clinical, I must say.

47:29.481 --> 47:32.721
But why label people?
There are different relationships.

47:33.121 --> 47:36.521
- Including hopeless relationships.
- Cheating is hopeless.

47:38.761 --> 47:42.041
- Would you forgive infidelity?
- Would you?

47:42.281 --> 47:44.961
Definitely, I am very open.

47:45.241 --> 47:47.841
- Some people just forgive.
- Some women, you mean.

47:48.201 --> 47:51.561
According to statistics,
39% of mean cheat,

47:51.961 --> 47:54.041
and only 29% of women.

47:54.281 --> 47:56.561
Then Beata is in the 29%.

47:56.841 --> 47:59.801
I mentioned it in my brochure entitled

47:59.961 --> 48:03.081
"Cheat on Her Before She Cheats on You".

48:03.321 --> 48:05.121
Beata was cheating?

48:07.481 --> 48:09.601
She cheated on him?

48:09.961 --> 48:13.361
She wants a divorce and his money.
This is the only explanation.

48:14.001 --> 48:16.401
And we believed her
like some suckers.

48:16.961 --> 48:19.321
We can't just leave it like that.

48:19.481 --> 48:21.441
- But what can we do?
- Tell him everything.

48:21.841 --> 48:24.041
That I pretended to be someone else?

48:24.841 --> 48:27.681
That I hit on him for his wife?
That our kiss wasn't real?

48:27.921 --> 48:29.801
Is that what you want me to say?

48:30.001 --> 48:32.801
Was it real?

48:47.721 --> 48:50.081
We've got a problem.

48:54.441 --> 48:59.681
If he forgave her infidelity
he must really love her.

49:04.361 --> 49:07.321
I'm not messing with that.

49:07.841 --> 49:10.241
This is it for me.

49:14.961 --> 49:17.441
- He never stops?
- I stopped answering.

49:17.721 --> 49:21.601
- Won't he take of fence?
- It's not his style.

49:28.761 --> 49:32.121
Fidelity investigators,
how can I help you?

49:32.561 --> 49:35.921
Yes, my friend will take care of this.

49:39.521 --> 49:41.081
Hello?

49:47.321 --> 49:49.761
Thank you.

49:51.121 --> 49:53.481
Excuse me, where is miss Kalina?

49:53.681 --> 49:56.801
She resigned.
But the new girl is good, too.

49:57.161 --> 49:59.641
Thank you.

50:01.161 --> 50:03.681
Prepare for the fight of the evening.

50:03.881 --> 50:07.881
The champion is here,
now let's welcome...

50:08.801 --> 50:12.161
Maciej Woltynski...

50:12.761 --> 50:15.481
Ready to rumble!

50:18.321 --> 50:21.081
- Hands higher.
- That's it! My new bestseller.

50:21.521 --> 50:23.921
"Turn Him Into a Warrior"

50:24.161 --> 50:26.041
- Give me a break.
- What?

50:26.281 --> 50:27.761
Don't you get it? It's their dream.

50:28.001 --> 50:29.961
Women want to be fought for.

50:30.241 --> 50:33.601
You should have a battle plan ready

50:33.961 --> 50:36.361
the very moment you open
your eyes in the morning.

50:36.681 --> 50:38.561
And what's in that plan?

50:38.841 --> 50:41.961
Three things: blood, sweat and tears.

50:42.321 --> 50:44.521
Your tears, of course.

50:45.721 --> 50:50.841
Now be honest,
did Beata agree to therapy?

50:54.241 --> 50:56.361
She's considering it.

50:56.561 --> 50:59.081
Why are you still with her?

50:59.721 --> 51:03.561
You told me to fight.
I am fighting.

51:03.961 --> 51:06.601
Yeah, but don't fight
for life with Godzilla.

51:07.401 --> 51:09.961
Raise your guard!

51:10.201 --> 51:13.321
We've been together for 7 years.

51:13.641 --> 51:16.961
I can't leave everything behind
just because of a rough time.

51:17.481 --> 51:21.321
Wouldn't - you - rather -
be - with - someone -

51:21.801 --> 51:26.201
who - is - in - love - with - you?

51:26.521 --> 51:29.161
With someone who really loves you?

51:29.761 --> 51:31.681
Huh?

51:34.241 --> 51:36.721
Sure, but...

51:36.881 --> 51:39.121
Does she have feelings for me?

51:39.321 --> 51:42.681
Then there is a she!

51:47.361 --> 51:49.961
Then there is a she!
Congrats!

51:50.721 --> 51:54.761
You're the most romantic man I know.

51:56.801 --> 51:59.041
I can't resist.

52:16.081 --> 52:19.441
Excuse me, I have to take this.

52:19.841 --> 52:22.281
- Hello?
- Hello?

52:23.041 --> 52:24.681
Are you there?

52:24.921 --> 52:27.321
You disappeared so I had to call you.

52:27.601 --> 52:31.201
I wanted to thank you
for the great catering.

52:31.601 --> 52:34.841
- Are you busy?
- No, why?

52:35.081 --> 52:38.481
Maybe we could grab a coffee?
Or go for a walk?

52:38.761 --> 52:40.881
- Could you stop?
- Excuse me?

52:41.121 --> 52:43.961
Nothing. Great.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.881
- We can discuss the invoice.
- I meant just a chat.

52:48.841 --> 52:51.961
All right, a friendly chat it is.

52:52.361 --> 52:55.721
Yes, a friendly chat.
You don't have to worry.

52:56.601 --> 52:59.241
Tomorrow at 5?

52:59.481 --> 53:01.801
Great.

53:04.081 --> 53:06.881
- I have to run now, work, bye.
- Bye.

53:07.801 --> 53:10.081
And now try these darlings on.

53:12.881 --> 53:16.481
And now... look right.

53:17.521 --> 53:19.641
Surprise.

53:21.721 --> 53:23.841
What a moron.

53:24.161 --> 53:25.761
Terrible.

53:25.961 --> 53:29.321
I mean Antek. Can you imagine?
He doesn't answer my calls.

53:30.201 --> 53:32.361
You wouldn't answer his.

53:32.641 --> 53:36.281
If he hopes I'm not going to
sleep because of him he is delusional.

53:37.881 --> 53:41.241
Last night you were all over the place.

53:44.481 --> 53:46.441
We have to change something.

53:51.721 --> 53:53.641
No more fidelity investigating.

53:53.881 --> 53:56.401
It's the most depressing job
in the world.

53:57.081 --> 53:59.961
I meant painting some walls.

54:00.241 --> 54:03.401
But you're right.
Let's go buy some paint tomorrow.

54:03.681 --> 54:06.081
Sure, we can go in the evening.

54:06.281 --> 54:08.521
I have a meeting at 5.

54:08.881 --> 54:11.041
What a meaningful smile.
Who is it?

54:13.921 --> 54:15.801
It's him.

54:20.561 --> 54:22.881
A date with him.

54:23.041 --> 54:25.281
Of course not.

54:25.561 --> 54:29.321
A friendly chat.
Don't forget he's married.

54:29.601 --> 54:31.881
His wife is a predator.

54:32.161 --> 54:36.241
Hey, don't be as cold as ice.

54:36.481 --> 54:39.841
Maciek is an endangered species,
save those precious genes.

54:49.281 --> 54:50.801
Welcome, gentlemen.

54:51.041 --> 54:54.681
I am the author of the brochure entitled
"Woman - a Monster With a Human Face".

54:54.961 --> 54:59.121
You have become the victims of
- let's not be afraid of these words -

54:59.401 --> 55:02.441
extreme sex-mobbing.

55:03.321 --> 55:06.201
- I knew it.
- My words exactly.

55:06.841 --> 55:09.481
Both the body and soul are hurt.

55:09.681 --> 55:12.481
- Those wounds leave scars.
- I can live with mobbing.

55:12.761 --> 55:15.561
But she took my daughter,
my apartment and my car.

55:15.881 --> 55:18.281
How could she?

55:19.361 --> 55:23.001
- Is a woman even a human being?
- Maybe you should call the cops.

55:23.321 --> 55:25.681
Gentlemen, I'll be brief.

55:26.801 --> 55:29.881
Revenge!

55:30.201 --> 55:33.121
Revenge soothes the pain,
it brings balance back.

55:33.321 --> 55:35.841
Revenge is, simply speaking,
a pleasure.

55:36.081 --> 55:38.601
It stimulates the reward system
in our brains -

55:38.881 --> 55:40.761
the system so devastated
by women.

55:41.001 --> 55:43.601
Let's do the same to them.

55:43.841 --> 55:46.441
Gentlemen, don't think
with your penises.

55:47.641 --> 55:49.921
You mean devastating them?

55:50.121 --> 55:53.841
Exactly.
Psychological devastation.

55:54.161 --> 55:57.361
Pick them up, kindle desire and
- careful, it's difficult-

55:57.561 --> 55:59.761
don't copulate.

56:00.001 --> 56:02.961
Don't copu... no shagging?

56:03.161 --> 56:05.241
No shagging.

56:05.481 --> 56:08.241
Abbreviation: PUKDDC.

56:08.841 --> 56:12.241
I'm out. I'm lucky to say
I don't know what "no shagging" means.

56:12.521 --> 56:14.641
You know, my penis...

56:14.921 --> 56:17.441
I know your penis, but in that case
you have to leave.

56:17.921 --> 56:20.041
Then I'll adjust.

56:20.281 --> 56:22.841
Gentlemen, operation Revenge,
here we go.

56:23.161 --> 56:28.081
Pick up, kindle desire, don't copulate.

56:28.361 --> 56:31.721
It's all very nice but...

56:32.081 --> 56:33.721
Why don't copulate?

56:33.961 --> 56:37.801
Rejection massacres a woman.

56:38.761 --> 56:40.681
Gentlemen, imagine this.

56:40.961 --> 56:46.481
A woman burning with desire
and aroused by your brilliant foreplay

56:46.801 --> 56:50.481
wants to surrender to you and hears:

56:51.081 --> 56:54.361
sorry, operation Revenge,
I have to get going.

56:55.401 --> 56:59.961
You deny them copulation
and they will go to shreds.

57:00.521 --> 57:02.961
Their nerves, self-esteem, worldview -
all begin to crumble.

57:03.201 --> 57:07.001
They feel guilty,
they try to lose weight.

57:07.241 --> 57:10.601
The best case scenario is alcoholism.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.401
Like in Afghanistan.

57:12.601 --> 57:15.121
Revenge isn't a piece of cake.

57:15.281 --> 57:17.361
Do you want to leave now?

57:17.681 --> 57:19.921
No. I can be useful in action.

57:20.361 --> 57:24.361
All this seems to have made me impotent.

57:25.961 --> 57:28.281
I can easily deny copulation.

57:28.681 --> 57:33.361
- I will adjust.
- I will think about death or mum.

57:33.641 --> 57:35.241
Splendid.

57:35.521 --> 57:38.161
Before you reject and ignite desire
you need to pick those women up.

57:38.401 --> 57:40.841
And this is a craft.

57:41.041 --> 57:44.401
We are going to master it.
Gentlemen, homework.

57:44.681 --> 57:48.361
How to charm a woman in 60 seconds.

57:49.441 --> 57:53.401
Tuesday, 7:15 PM.

57:54.321 --> 57:56.201
Operation Revenge.

57:56.681 --> 57:58.121
That's it.

57:58.361 --> 58:01.721
- Let's synchronise our watches.
- What time is it?

58:02.081 --> 58:04.401
Mine is perfectly fine.

58:07.481 --> 58:11.041
You must be busy.
Last night it felt like you...

58:13.041 --> 58:15.041
had a lot on your mind.

58:15.281 --> 58:17.841
Just regular stuff.

58:20.401 --> 58:22.681
What do you do apart from catering?

58:23.001 --> 58:26.361
You mentioned websites.
Juggling two very distant passions.

58:26.601 --> 58:28.361
That's amazing.

58:28.761 --> 58:31.761
Maciek, why did you want to meet today?

58:32.881 --> 58:34.961
Be honest with me.

58:35.201 --> 58:37.441
Where's the investigation lamp?

58:38.281 --> 58:40.641
You know why I'm asking.

58:46.681 --> 58:49.401
I like talking to you.

58:51.521 --> 58:54.281
More than talking to your wife?

58:59.241 --> 59:01.481
My marriage has been falling apart
for several years.

59:02.481 --> 59:05.321
I'm just pretending that's not true.

59:06.841 --> 59:09.641
There isn't much left to fix, anyway.

59:15.241 --> 59:17.841
I don't know what to say.

59:25.641 --> 59:29.641
Say you'll meet me sometimes.

59:35.481 --> 59:38.121
I can do sometimes.

59:38.761 --> 59:41.441
- Tonight.
- That's not sometimes.

59:41.721 --> 59:45.081
- Tomorrow?
- Alright.

59:54.201 --> 59:56.521
How is it gonna be?

59:56.761 --> 59:58.921
Powder pink or light sapphire?

01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:03.561
- I'm scared.
- I can always repaint it.

01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:11.641
I might have fallen in love.

01:00:19.681 --> 01:00:21.841
It's too late.

01:00:22.441 --> 01:00:24.041
That's really comforting.

01:00:24.201 --> 01:00:27.201
No worries, I have a gun,
it's gonna be fine.

01:00:27.401 --> 01:00:29.481
- Like you asked.
- Thank you.

01:00:29.681 --> 01:00:32.441
Hey?

01:00:34.401 --> 01:00:36.401
Look at this.

01:00:38.321 --> 01:00:40.241
I taught her that.

01:00:40.521 --> 01:00:42.801
Several unanswered calls
and finally she's cooperating.

01:00:43.081 --> 01:00:46.441
There is something we have to do.
Are you free tomorrow?

01:00:46.761 --> 01:00:49.081
I'd have to check my schedule.

01:00:49.321 --> 01:00:51.601
There is this thing.
We need to talk.

01:00:52.201 --> 01:00:54.681
With pleasure.

01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:05.001
- It's silly.
- Lower your voice.

01:01:05.281 --> 01:01:07.401
She will recognise me.
I do my manicure there.

01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:09.401
For professional reasons of course.

01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:12.081
- Use your charm.
- It doesn't always work.

01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:14.521
All you have to do is seduce her.

01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:17.001
In the garden,
so that I can take good photos.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.161
Fine.

01:01:20.521 --> 01:01:22.761
- Can you see anything?
- No.

01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:26.281
- I'll get on your back.
- No, wait a moment.

01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:29.681
Seriously, I have a back problem.

01:01:31.281 --> 01:01:34.401
- Fine. Hop on.
- What?

01:01:34.801 --> 01:01:37.881
- Hop on my back.
- I'm small but heavier than you so...

01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:39.841
- Get up.
- Ready?

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:42.961
- Yes.
- Now.

01:01:45.241 --> 01:01:48.481
- Is she there?
- Yes, yes she is.

01:01:49.321 --> 01:01:51.961
- Operation Bosom or nature.
- Please...

01:01:52.201 --> 01:01:54.721
I'm sorry, I can't control it.

01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:57.641
I'm going in.

01:02:00.681 --> 01:02:02.641
Hello there.

01:02:02.921 --> 01:02:05.481
What are you doing here?

01:02:05.961 --> 01:02:08.721
Didn't you order a trim?

01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:11.121
Not that I can recall.

01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:13.521
Darling Beata...

01:02:14.561 --> 01:02:17.121
- I'm calling the police.
- There's been a mistake.

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:19.881
Excuse me and good bye.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.681
Got it?

01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:49.121
Great. Listen, would you let me
invite you to lunch?

01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:54.161
There's a vegan food truck festival.

01:02:54.961 --> 01:02:58.321
- Cool.
- You can have a beef burrito.

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.641
I couldn't do that.

01:03:01.641 --> 01:03:03.601
Why not? You're not vegan.

01:03:04.361 --> 01:03:07.201
Let's go eat.

01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:18.401
- Do we have an appointment?
- These are some beautiful photos.

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:21.841
Want a divorce? Have one.

01:03:22.081 --> 01:03:23.801
But not at the expense
of an innocent man.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:28.281
If you want to live like a queen
tell Miguel to find a job.

01:03:28.521 --> 01:03:31.041
Diego. And Diego has a job.

01:03:31.361 --> 01:03:33.841
He is a drum virtuoso.

01:03:34.641 --> 01:03:38.001
Hi Diego, I'm Antonio.
I play drums too.

01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:42.241
I'm sorry.

01:03:44.961 --> 01:03:48.321
You're not taking any money.
That's not an option.

01:03:54.841 --> 01:03:56.881
My heart is broken, leave.

01:03:57.961 --> 01:03:59.801
But why, I love you.

01:04:00.161 --> 01:04:02.281
No, no, no.
Beata.

01:04:02.921 --> 01:04:05.081
No, no, no.

01:04:06.081 --> 01:04:08.401
A real soap opera break up.

01:04:08.681 --> 01:04:11.081
Nothing happened, ok?

01:04:11.361 --> 01:04:15.481
- Maybe we could give Diego a ride?
- Is your sugar low or what?

01:04:34.881 --> 01:04:38.321
- I'm ready.
- Wait in the car, ok?

01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:40.441
Sure.

01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:51.921
Hey.

01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:58.761
- Hi.
- You look great.

01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:04.081
- I thought I'd say hi.
- Whatever.

01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:10.161
- How are you doing?
- Me?

01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:16.281
I'm still with Sylwia,
the girl from the elevator.

01:05:17.521 --> 01:05:20.881
We got married in Vegas.

01:05:22.921 --> 01:05:25.681
But it's been hard.

01:05:27.081 --> 01:05:30.441
- Monogamy isn't your strong suit.
- It's not like that.

01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:35.081
I really fell in love with her.
It wasn't some silly affair.

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:40.241
I know what you felt.

01:05:40.841 --> 01:05:43.041
- You do?
- Yes.

01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:47.561
I was so glad that Sylwia was so...
temperamental.

01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:51.161
Until she slept with the postman.

01:05:52.561 --> 01:05:55.921
And the plumber.

01:05:57.881 --> 01:06:00.481
The same day.

01:06:00.921 --> 01:06:04.281
She is a sexaholic,
she is getting treatment.

01:06:06.801 --> 01:06:09.481
But she's like a horny pit bull.

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:11.881
- Rafal.
- Yes?

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:15.001
What do you want me to say?

01:06:16.281 --> 01:06:19.281
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. How are you?

01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:21.961
Have you met anyone?

01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:25.481
- Maybe there's still a chance for us?
- No, there isn't.

01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:33.481
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:06:33.801 --> 01:06:35.921
My ex.

01:06:36.401 --> 01:06:39.801
Call me if you change your mind.

01:06:44.361 --> 01:06:48.361
- He still hopes for something?
- No, and neither do I.

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:54.241
- Want to kick his ass?
- Oh, I completely forgot.

01:06:56.361 --> 01:06:58.681
You know what?

01:06:59.241 --> 01:07:02.281
Not anymore.

01:07:03.801 --> 01:07:09.081
- What is this?
- Some Chilean sour wine?

01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:17.281
- Pretty tasty.
- You know, I went to Chile once.

01:07:17.961 --> 01:07:20.881
- Really?
- In college.

01:07:22.281 --> 01:07:24.801
So did I.

01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:30.681
One of the most beautiful observatories
in the world is in the Atacama desert.

01:07:32.121 --> 01:07:35.161
Space is fascinating?

01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:38.121
It really is.

01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:42.041
There is no atmosphere
on the moon,

01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:46.401
scientifically speaking.

01:07:47.641 --> 01:07:50.321
So if we went for a walk,

01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:53.961
our footprints would be visible
for several million years.

01:07:54.601 --> 01:07:56.801
That's nice.

01:07:56.961 --> 01:07:59.161
A stars avenue.

01:07:59.361 --> 01:08:03.881
By the way, the speed of light
isn't what we all think.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:11.361
- I'm sorry, I'm boring you to death.
- No, continue.

01:08:16.361 --> 01:08:18.921
The best part was
when we were hitchhiking.

01:08:19.121 --> 01:08:21.321
- Guess who stopped.
- Who?

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.761
- A baker.
- With his produce. Lucky you.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.281
After 20 miles on foot those were
the best buns in my life.

01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:37.401
It's getting late.

01:08:39.961 --> 01:08:42.640
Thank you for meeting me.

01:08:43.921 --> 01:08:46.801
It was nice.

01:08:48.321 --> 01:08:50.321
Bye.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.481
I don't want to pretend anymore.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.481
Pretend what?

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.361
That I don't have feelings for you.

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:07.161
I don't know how this happened...

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.041
You are... someone...

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.321
Who?

01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:20.441
Who am I?

01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:24.161
You'll have paint
all over your jacket.

01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:26.841
I'll have it cleaned.

01:10:29.201 --> 01:10:30.641
FIDELITY INVESTIGATORS

01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:35.961
What do you want for breakf...

01:10:39.601 --> 01:10:41.921
I can explain.

01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:45.921
- I will explain.
- I bet you will.

01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:50.321
Maciek, don't.

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:54.401
I din't want to lie.

01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:58.361
You were so real to me.

01:10:58.681 --> 01:11:01.561
That's why I fell in love with you.

01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:11.681
You're not anymore.

01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:46.441
Oh, you're here.

01:11:47.601 --> 01:11:49.881
Coffee?

01:11:50.361 --> 01:11:53.481
Won't you ask where I spent the night?

01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:58.721
No, and here's why.

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:02.041
I want to leave the past behind.

01:12:02.561 --> 01:12:05.921
Let's have a fresh start.

01:12:11.721 --> 01:12:13.601
You want a divorce?

01:12:13.761 --> 01:12:16.281
Mouse, I underestimated you.

01:12:16.481 --> 01:12:19.841
I want to be the perfect wife
so I'm giving you another chance.

01:12:20.601 --> 01:12:23.961
I can even go to therapy.
It doesn't get crazier than this.

01:12:28.841 --> 01:12:31.681
Are you sure you want this?

01:12:32.161 --> 01:12:35.361
Yes, I couldn't live
in any other place.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.961
This is my home.
This is our home.

01:12:41.121 --> 01:12:44.761
- This is a real surprise.
- In a good way.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:48.721
You can spoil me with gifts
as a reward.

01:12:49.961 --> 01:12:52.081
So here we have it.

01:12:52.441 --> 01:12:55.401
I knew it.

01:12:55.641 --> 01:12:58.841
I was joking, sweetheart.

01:13:00.161 --> 01:13:04.241
I made your favourite
gorgonzola toasts.

01:13:06.241 --> 01:13:09.601
But I don't like gorgonzola.

01:13:12.401 --> 01:13:15.761
Of course you do.

01:13:19.681 --> 01:13:21.841
- It's too big.
- Why?

01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:25.241
- I don't like it.
- It's gonna be cool.

01:13:27.961 --> 01:13:30.721
Somebody had too much wine.

01:13:30.881 --> 01:13:34.641
There is a simple solution.
Fight fire with fire.

01:13:35.601 --> 01:13:38.961
- Open the champagne, please.
- Sure.

01:13:43.121 --> 01:13:45.681
What's wrong?

01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:48.921
What happened?

01:13:50.961 --> 01:13:53.281
So?

01:13:59.681 --> 01:14:03.601
No, tell me you didn't
bring him here.

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:11.881
What have you done,
darling girl.

01:14:16.521 --> 01:14:19.321
Didn't you tell her?
Ok, I will.

01:14:19.481 --> 01:14:22.841
We're engaged to be married.

01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:26.681
I'll wait over there.

01:14:29.601 --> 01:14:32.561
What were you thinking?

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:41.561
Now I get renovation workers.

01:14:42.281 --> 01:14:45.201
- This line of work requires drinking.
- Right.

01:14:45.721 --> 01:14:49.081
Every renovation worker I meet
is holding a glass of champagne.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:55.681
- I spoiled your engagement.
- Stop it!

01:14:57.561 --> 01:14:59.961
Maybe you can fix it?

01:15:00.361 --> 01:15:03.721
- I don't see how.
- Talk to him.

01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:08.321
He's divorcing Beata anyway.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:14.241
Do you think he'd trust me again?

01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:22.401
I don't know. You have to fight,
but you'd rather whine,

01:15:22.641 --> 01:15:25.961
pretend you're painting
and become and alcoholic.

01:15:31.481 --> 01:15:34.121
You know I want what's best for you.

01:15:34.961 --> 01:15:39.281
Do something,
there's nothing to lose.

01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:47.801
That's not what I meant.

01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:16.481
I'd like to talk to Maciek.

01:16:16.641 --> 01:16:19.241
My husband is busy,
how can I help you?

01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:22.721
It will take only a moment.

01:16:25.401 --> 01:16:28.761
Listen, about the other photo shoot,

01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:31.241
I will pay you
to get rid of the photos.

01:16:31.401 --> 01:16:33.281
We'll work it out
on another occasion.

01:16:33.481 --> 01:16:36.841
I don't want the money.
That's why I'm here.

01:16:40.041 --> 01:16:42.681
Hi.

01:16:43.321 --> 01:16:46.521
Can we talk?

01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:50.081
In private?

01:16:51.201 --> 01:16:54.841
There's nothing to talk about.

01:16:56.001 --> 01:16:58.561
That's right. My husband isn't
working right now.

01:16:58.721 --> 01:17:02.081
You can go to another coaching centre.

01:17:02.361 --> 01:17:06.561
Choose one and confide in them
if you feel the need to do so.

01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:10.921
But now...
Please excuse us...

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:14.961
We have other plans.

01:17:18.521 --> 01:17:21.881
We're not getting a divorce.

01:17:24.961 --> 01:17:27.441
I get it.

01:17:53.361 --> 01:17:55.801
You scared me.

01:17:59.401 --> 01:18:01.961
I don't know why you didn't
show him the photos.

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:04.921
He'd dump her right away.

01:18:06.121 --> 01:18:09.481
- And never speak to me, too.
- Why?

01:18:11.161 --> 01:18:13.081
Because I seduced him for money

01:18:13.241 --> 01:18:15.841
and hid in ambush in front of his house
like some freaking CIA.

01:18:16.081 --> 01:18:18.401
I was the one in ambush.

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:22.721
But you're right.

01:18:27.481 --> 01:18:30.161
At least you found love.

01:18:30.481 --> 01:18:33.361
When's the date?

01:18:34.961 --> 01:18:38.321
- In a month.
- One month?

01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:42.721
- What, are you pregnant?
- No, why?

01:18:47.881 --> 01:18:52.281
- It's just strong love.
- No Afghan details.

01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:55.481
Please.

01:18:55.681 --> 01:18:59.041
I have something for you.

01:19:02.601 --> 01:19:05.961
Celery and kale cocktail.

01:19:07.121 --> 01:19:09.521
Liquid health. Drink it up.

01:19:14.441 --> 01:19:17.801
It's not that bad.

01:19:18.321 --> 01:19:23.481
- Sorry, I need something stronger.
- I can add some vodka.

01:19:24.241 --> 01:19:27.601
Chocolate.

01:19:30.761 --> 01:19:34.121
You're going to be fat
on my wedding.

01:19:44.641 --> 01:19:48.001
I forgot one thing.

01:19:50.961 --> 01:19:53.961
What do you need him for?

01:19:54.241 --> 01:19:56.401
I'll throw him away on the way.

01:19:57.241 --> 01:20:00.281
He lost his head too many times.

01:20:01.681 --> 01:20:05.561
Maybe he can be fixed?

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:09.041
He suffered too many blows.

01:20:14.841 --> 01:20:18.201
Shall we go?

01:20:33.441 --> 01:20:36.041
THE WEDDING IS CANCELLED

01:20:36.561 --> 01:20:38.881
Oh no.

01:20:56.241 --> 01:20:59.601
Do you know how many calls I made
to find you here?

01:21:05.641 --> 01:21:08.521
What happened?

01:21:09.761 --> 01:21:13.281
I can't marry him.

01:21:16.081 --> 01:21:19.161
Why?

01:21:21.921 --> 01:21:25.281
Did he hurt you?

01:21:26.161 --> 01:21:29.521
Tell me. Tap it in Morse code.

01:21:43.121 --> 01:21:46.481
It's pointless.

01:21:46.881 --> 01:21:49.401
Therapy?

01:21:49.721 --> 01:21:53.081
No, everything.

01:22:00.481 --> 01:22:03.841
I was going to say the same thing.

01:22:05.441 --> 01:22:08.321
I really tried but...

01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:12.121
You can't win with true love.

01:22:12.921 --> 01:22:15.881
You noticed.

01:22:16.121 --> 01:22:19.201
Noticed what?

01:22:19.521 --> 01:22:22.441
I fell in love.

01:22:22.721 --> 01:22:26.081
- I fell deeper.
- Who is it?

01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:32.881
You don't know him.

01:22:33.921 --> 01:22:37.281
Maybe it's for the better.

01:22:39.081 --> 01:22:42.161
I think I'm going to Cuba after all.

01:23:35.561 --> 01:23:38.921
Bye.

01:23:53.881 --> 01:23:56.761
- Perfect timing.
- Hi. What?

01:23:57.001 --> 01:24:00.721
Listen, I don't want to nag you.

01:24:02.681 --> 01:24:06.841
I need your help.
It's for my best friend.

01:24:08.801 --> 01:24:11.401
Maybe I shouldn't have called.

01:24:20.401 --> 01:24:22.081
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:24:22.401 --> 01:24:24.601
May I?

01:24:24.801 --> 01:24:28.601
- But I'm with a friend.
- I like threesomes.

01:24:29.041 --> 01:24:33.641
- Let me introduce myself. Maciej.
- Sylwia.

01:24:35.641 --> 01:24:40.281
I wanted to throw him away,
but I can still use him.

01:24:42.961 --> 01:24:45.721
What an interesting idea.

01:24:46.841 --> 01:24:50.201
You like such crazy stuff?

01:24:54.481 --> 01:24:56.401
So do I.

01:24:56.841 --> 01:25:00.201
No, it's not like that.

01:25:00.441 --> 01:25:03.801
- It's more...
- Don't bother explaining.

01:25:04.801 --> 01:25:08.161
The stories I've heard
at the meetings...

01:25:10.321 --> 01:25:13.681
Are you an alcoholic?

01:25:14.681 --> 01:25:18.041
Sexaholic.

01:25:22.281 --> 01:25:27.121
Are you in a hurry?
Maybe we could take a turn?

01:25:28.721 --> 01:25:30.921
I'm in a hurry.

01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:36.441
You love him, you don't,
you love him, you don't...

01:25:37.761 --> 01:25:40.201
- You love him, you love him.
- It's not how it goes.

01:25:40.521 --> 01:25:42.681
Only love.

01:25:43.081 --> 01:25:46.441
Could you spare a cup of tea
for 2 wanderers?

01:25:51.961 --> 01:25:55.321
- Black or earl grey?
- Plain black.

01:25:59.761 --> 01:26:03.121
Thanks for coming.

01:26:03.361 --> 01:26:06.721
Why did you bring him?

01:26:07.601 --> 01:26:09.961
I'll explain it later.

01:26:33.561 --> 01:26:36.921
- She's not coming, son.
- She's never late.

01:26:37.281 --> 01:26:39.841
There's always a first.

01:26:40.321 --> 01:26:42.081
She'll be here.

01:26:42.401 --> 01:26:45.521
As a mother and a woman,
I know she won't.

01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:48.601
And I know she will.

01:26:49.561 --> 01:26:51.361
I'm not marrying him.
End of story.

01:26:51.561 --> 01:26:53.481
- Nobody tells you to.
- Yeah, right.

01:26:53.681 --> 01:26:55.921
If you run, you might lose him.

01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:58.761
Why did you change your mind?

01:26:59.641 --> 01:27:02.961
This marriage might be
the biggest mistake of my life.

01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:08.081
Imagine this is Antek.

01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:22.761
If you could lie
that you love millet burgers

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:27.601
and that you're a vegan blogger,

01:27:28.241 --> 01:27:31.401
how do I know
that you won't always lie?

01:27:32.801 --> 01:27:36.161
How will I know what's true?

01:27:38.521 --> 01:27:41.881
What if you hurt me?

01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:47.521
Antek is the kindest liar I ever met.

01:27:48.001 --> 01:27:51.361
There are different kinds of liars.

01:27:53.841 --> 01:27:57.201
Are you ready to lose him?

01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:06.241
Antek, I love you.

01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:11.321
I love you.

01:28:13.441 --> 01:28:15.761
I love you so much.

01:28:16.241 --> 01:28:20.281
I hate to ruin the moment
but he doesn't have feelings for you.

01:28:21.281 --> 01:28:23.881
The real Antek
is going crazy right now. Let's go.

01:28:24.121 --> 01:28:26.561
What's the time?

01:28:28.281 --> 01:28:31.641
Well done.

01:28:48.001 --> 01:28:51.721
I couldn't leave, Kalina needed me.
A total emergency.

01:28:54.921 --> 01:28:57.281
- I'm sorry.
- Calm down.

01:28:57.601 --> 01:28:59.721
- So what's the decision?
- We're getting married.

01:29:00.281 --> 01:29:02.401
But we need a best man
and a maid of honour.

01:29:02.801 --> 01:29:04.641
How about me?

01:29:05.121 --> 01:29:07.761
And the other one?

01:29:08.241 --> 01:29:10.241
God's always here
and he is the most important.

01:29:10.481 --> 01:29:13.841
And if he's busy, I'm here.

01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:17.601
- How about a wedding?
- With pleasure.

01:29:18.281 --> 01:29:21.641
Wait.

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:30.241
5 minutes before your call
we broke up with Beata.

01:29:34.721 --> 01:29:38.081
I thought you might want to know.

01:29:40.841 --> 01:29:43.961
I don't know what to say.

01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:48.001
I'm sorry.

01:29:50.161 --> 01:29:52.321
Are you really sorry?

01:29:52.601 --> 01:29:55.961
Not really.

01:29:58.441 --> 01:30:02.561
- So you are a little glad?
- Just a little bit.

01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:16.841
- And now?
- I'm not sure. Keep trying.

01:30:36.561 --> 01:30:39.241
THE END

01:31:01.601 --> 01:31:03.521
What are you staring at?

01:31:03.761 --> 01:31:05.961
You were supposed to
pick me up, right?

01:31:06.521 --> 01:31:09.881
- Let's start with you.
- Me? - Yes, you.

01:31:21.401 --> 01:31:23.601
Hello...

01:31:23.841 --> 01:31:26.481
- What's the time?
- What's wrong with your voice?

01:31:26.721 --> 01:31:29.361
- I always do that.
- Are you reading a bedtime story?

01:31:29.561 --> 01:31:32.441
- It used to work.
- Sit down.

01:31:32.961 --> 01:31:35.081
It's your turn.

01:31:39.841 --> 01:31:42.681
Why is such a...

01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:46.361
beautiful woman alone in a cafe?

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:50.161
- To fart around.
- I knew it.

01:31:54.721 --> 01:31:58.081
- Do you have anything to add?
- Go.

01:32:07.281 --> 01:32:09.641
Could I tell you a story
about a doggy?

01:32:09.761 --> 01:32:11.641
I said, no copulation.

01:32:11.801 --> 01:32:14.601
It's not about copulation.
I have a spaniel and maybe...

01:32:15.081 --> 01:32:17.201
Maybe has one to connect us.

01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:19.721
- What spaniel?
- A dog and...

01:32:20.041 --> 01:32:24.081
Gentlemen, you're supposed to
make me go crazy with desire.

01:32:24.921 --> 01:32:27.041
Is a spaniel really
the best tool?

01:32:27.401 --> 01:32:29.921
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

01:32:30.241 --> 01:32:31.721
I'm sorry.

01:32:32.041 --> 01:32:35.401
You need to use her pity for you.

01:32:36.641 --> 01:32:38.761
Pity?

01:32:38.961 --> 01:32:42.321
Like, would you lend me some money?

01:32:44.761 --> 01:32:48.121
I'm turning this
into a shit-hot brochure.

01:32:48.521 --> 01:32:50.961
You shouldn't have
mentioned the money.

01:32:51.321 --> 01:32:54.921
- It can be small amount.
- Stop talking about money.
