00:17.920 --> 00:20.160
If anyone thinks bell-ringing
is easy,

00:20.160 --> 00:22.199
they should come over here
and sniff my armpits.

00:22.199 --> 00:24.760
Thank you for that, Miss Thundersby.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.239
Are you all right, my dear?

00:26.239 --> 00:29.160
Yeah, just a little achy
in the upper arm.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.039
Well, allow me to escort you
ladies to the Red Lion.

00:32.039 --> 00:33.560
I don't think so.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.119
I'm sorry? I have a number of notes
on this evening's performance.

00:37.119 --> 00:40.560
Oh, piggy, Mervyn! We've been
ringing for three-and-a-half hours.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.399
Indeed. And it was three-and-a-half
hours of schoolboy errors.

00:43.399 --> 00:45.560
Hello! Am I interrupting anything?

00:45.560 --> 00:47.039
No. No!

00:47.039 --> 00:50.679
May I introduce
Mr Jamie Cheeseman.

00:50.679 --> 00:54.640
Mr Cheeseman has been appointed by
Canon Fox to be Director of Music

00:54.640 --> 00:58.159
for the diocese, and he's very keen
to work with you.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.520
That's right.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.560
I've always been fascinated
by campanology.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.438
We do not approve of the word
"campanology".

01:04.438 --> 01:06.760
A mongrel word, combining,
as it does, the Latin for

01:06.760 --> 01:10.359
bell - "campana" - with the Greek
for study - "ology".

01:10.359 --> 01:12.840
We are change-ringers,
and proud of it.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.719
Mr Glossop is tower captain.

01:14.719 --> 01:17.280
And as there can only be one
captain of the ship,

01:17.280 --> 01:19.680
I respectfully ask you to leave.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.239
Actually, I think that's
somewhat disrespectful.

01:22.239 --> 01:23.719
Do you, indeed?

01:23.719 --> 01:26.159
I really do admire what
you're doing here.

01:26.159 --> 01:28.599
Your admiration is not reciprocated.

01:28.599 --> 01:30.960
Please, I've got some hand-bells.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.960
I do hope you will be very happy
with your little bells.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.280
But our bells have hung
for over 500 years.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.520
They announce historic occasions,
the outbreak of war,

01:42.520 --> 01:45.439
and sometimes, even funerals.

01:45.439 --> 01:49.120
Sorry, was that a threat?
Not a threat, Mr Cheeseman.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.599
A prophecy.

02:21.879 --> 02:23.560
Is he always like that?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.920
Mr Glossop can be somewhat
temperamental.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.920
50% temper and 50% mental.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.840
Of course, as well as restoring the
bells, it's important

02:32.840 --> 02:35.079
to restore harmony to the ringing
chamber.

02:35.079 --> 02:39.719
And that would be best achieved by
judicious use of flattery.

02:39.719 --> 02:41.439
Two halves, please, Raymond.

02:41.439 --> 02:45.079
So, once again, a musical director
has been foisted on us.

02:45.079 --> 02:47.520
They soon find they know
considerably less than I do.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.599
The previous one lasted three weeks.

02:49.599 --> 02:52.840
Let's hope Mr Cheese-man
will depart somewhat sooner.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.560
Well, I, um...

02:54.560 --> 02:57.079
Spit it out, Phoebe.

02:57.079 --> 02:59.240
Would it be so bad to give him a go?

02:59.240 --> 03:01.400
I mean, he might be rather good.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.319
Yes. You know, young
blood and all that.

03:03.319 --> 03:05.960
We do not need youth to instruct us

03:05.960 --> 03:08.400
in an ancient and unchanging
art form.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.080
I have been ringing these
bells for 42 years.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.840
Do you mind if we join you?

03:13.840 --> 03:15.520
Oh, please do.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.159
I know that we didn't get off to
the best of starts,

03:19.159 --> 03:21.879
and it's always awkward when a new
boy comes along...

03:21.879 --> 03:23.680
..but...

03:23.680 --> 03:25.280
..I'd love to work with you

03:25.280 --> 03:29.879
and bring St Marys' ringers
to new and dizzying heights.

03:29.879 --> 03:33.079
Mr Cheeseman, we already
have a working method,

03:33.079 --> 03:35.840
honed and refined
over several decades.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.319
If you like,
I will write to Canon Fox,

03:38.319 --> 03:41.479
and explain that your services
are not required.

03:41.479 --> 03:44.079
Well, I could actually save
you the stamp.

03:44.079 --> 03:45.560
Canon Fox is my uncle.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.639
But, really, I don't want to do
anything drastic.

03:50.639 --> 03:53.120
You're already an extremely
accomplished group.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.439
But it struck me the bells
themselves are less than perfect.

03:56.439 --> 03:58.079
They're just a bit rusty.

03:58.079 --> 04:00.719
So I thought -
why not have a fundraiser?

04:00.719 --> 04:02.599
So that we could take them
to the foundry,

04:02.599 --> 04:04.240
have them re-tuned and re-hanged,

04:04.240 --> 04:06.120
and then they will make a sound
that's worthy

04:06.120 --> 04:09.000
of such a magnificent band
of ringers.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.800
Canon Fox's nephew?!

04:16.800 --> 04:18.160
Indeed.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.759
No mystery then to how he got such a
prestigious position...

04:21.759 --> 04:25.560
He is, apparently, a very talented
composer who has worked with

04:25.560 --> 04:27.399
the London Opera Company.

04:27.399 --> 04:30.639
But if he's Canon Fox's nephew,
he's bound to be a bit of a drip.

04:30.639 --> 04:35.199
On the contrary, he seems very
lively and full of ideas.

04:35.199 --> 04:38.319
Full of ideas? And who has to do
the donkey work?

04:38.319 --> 04:39.399
Me.

04:42.959 --> 04:44.800
Enoch! Hello!

04:44.800 --> 04:48.840
Good morning, nice to see you.
How may I be of assistance?

04:48.840 --> 04:53.399
Well, we have to... I have to do
some baking for this fund-raiser,

04:53.399 --> 04:56.600
and I'm in need of two dozen eggs.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.519
Ah, well, you are in luck, as all
of our ladies have been laying.

04:59.519 --> 05:01.000
Oh, well, isn't that marvellous.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.279
Hello! Hello!

05:04.279 --> 05:07.279
Gosh, it's a small world.

05:07.279 --> 05:09.399
Mr Jamie Cheeseman.

05:09.399 --> 05:11.360
Mrs McCarthy, our parish secretary.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.199
How do you do? And Bunty Windermere.

05:14.279 --> 05:16.600
Hello. Welcome to our village.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.240
Thank you.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.240
Though I actually came to see Enoch.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.920
Oh. Oh, yes?

05:21.920 --> 05:25.560
Yes. A trunkload of my possessions
has just arrived from London,

05:25.560 --> 05:28.879
and I find I have rather a large
collection of gospel records.

05:28.879 --> 05:30.879
Now, I don't know if that's your
sort of music,

05:30.879 --> 05:32.759
but you're more than welcome
to borrow them.

05:32.759 --> 05:36.879
I love gospel! I used to be
in a choir in Trinidad.

05:36.879 --> 05:40.279
Yes. Phoebe said you enjoyed the
singing,

05:40.279 --> 05:43.399
and I wondered if we could use
you at the fete.

05:43.399 --> 05:44.720
In what way?

05:44.720 --> 05:48.600
Well, I also write songs, and I was
thinking, as well as a bell-ringing

05:48.600 --> 05:51.439
performance, we could perhaps hear
you sing one of my compositions.

05:51.439 --> 05:54.240
Oh. Well, that would be an honour!

05:54.240 --> 05:56.159
Let me have a look at your
collection.

05:56.159 --> 05:58.959
Well, I take back what I said.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.199
He does have a certain
je ne sais quoi.

06:03.319 --> 06:06.360
Well, I don't know about your
"je ne sais quoi",

06:06.360 --> 06:09.120
but I suppose the bell-ringers
could do with someone

06:09.120 --> 06:11.240
with a bit of enthusiasm.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.560
One, two, three, four.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.560
One, two, three, four.

06:16.759 --> 06:19.560
# Ring that bell

06:19.560 --> 06:21.519
# From the top of the tower

06:21.519 --> 06:23.560
# Ring that bell

06:23.560 --> 06:26.000
# In your desperate hour

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
# Ring that bell

06:28.000 --> 06:30.040
# To appeal to his power

06:30.040 --> 06:31.399
# Ring that bell... #

06:31.399 --> 06:36.360
It's a bit Like having Paul Robeson
in your own living room.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.879
# When the darkness is near

06:37.879 --> 06:40.319
# Ring that bell

06:40.319 --> 06:42.120
# And you're drowning in fear

06:42.120 --> 06:44.240
# Ring that bell

06:44.240 --> 06:46.399
# So the saviour will hear

06:46.399 --> 06:51.560
# Ring that bell! Ring that bell! #

06:55.159 --> 06:56.879
Mr Cheeseman.

06:56.879 --> 06:58.240
Hello.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.720
I have been perusing this
so-called composition

07:00.720 --> 07:03.920
you wish us to
perform at the fete.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.600
Oh, yes? It appears to be false.

07:06.600 --> 07:11.000
In course one, the treble changes
place with bell two.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.879
And in the third course,
you make the same change again.

07:14.879 --> 07:17.759
Can someone translate
that into English?

07:17.759 --> 07:22.160
Under the rules of change-ringing,
you must never repeat a change.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.199
Rules are there for a reason.

07:25.199 --> 07:29.120
But since you seem incapable of
obeying them, I suggest you

07:29.120 --> 07:34.680
take your technically-deficient
composition back to London.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.079
Mr Glossop.

07:36.079 --> 07:39.040
Although we are thankful for the
work you have done in the past,

07:39.040 --> 07:42.879
if you find it so difficult
to accept new members,

07:42.879 --> 07:45.519
perhaps it is you who should
be leaving.

07:45.519 --> 07:47.920
This man is the viper in the nest.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.920
He is destroying our group.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.920
And unless we stand up to him,
he will destroy us all.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.360
Please, Mervyn. He's not trying to
destroy us.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.879
We rather like him. Do you indeed?

08:00.879 --> 08:02.439
Well, I wonder...

08:02.439 --> 08:06.439
..would he feel the same if he knew
what I knew?

08:06.439 --> 08:08.120
Phoebe.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.720
Or should that be Fibby?

08:09.720 --> 08:15.120
Because who could believe a word
that comes from your angelic lips?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.800
And Enoch.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.360
So kind.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.240
So caring.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.839
So lucky they never sent
you to prison.

08:23.839 --> 08:25.519
And Ruth...

08:26.680 --> 08:29.279
..you sing from the heart.

08:29.279 --> 08:33.840
But what a sordid,
squalid cesspit of a heart.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.240
I'm so looking forward to your fete.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.159
JAUNTY MUSIC PLAYS

Testing...
FEEDBACK

08:58.519 --> 09:00.080
Testing.

09:00.080 --> 09:04.679
Ruthy? What? When we do our song,
shall we stand together,

09:04.679 --> 09:07.080
cheek to cheek, like this?
Oh, I don't think so.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.399
What?

09:08.399 --> 09:10.960
Well, not so close that we're
sharing mascara.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.759
Cream horn, anyone?

09:12.759 --> 09:16.200
Thank you kindly! It's hungry work
doing backing vocals.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.720
Has anyone seen Jamie? He wandered
off a few minutes ago,

09:18.720 --> 09:20.360
just to see some stalls.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.240
Well, if anyone sees him, tell him
I've got something sweet for him.

09:23.240 --> 09:27.840
We will! You've no idea what a joy
he's been to work with.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.080
After all those years with Mervyn.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.879
Who was always a bit of a
wet blanket.

09:31.879 --> 09:34.320
Oh, Enoch, that's so unfair...

09:34.320 --> 09:36.159
..to wet blankets.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.279
Wet blanket? I gave you years.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.279
Oh, Mervyn, we didn't mean it, we...
Years!

09:41.279 --> 09:42.879
We're just a bit nervous.

09:42.879 --> 09:45.919
Oh, look, a microphone.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.720
Hopefully there'll be quite a crowd
here at one o'clock.

10:00.919 --> 10:02.639
I will get it next time.

10:02.639 --> 10:05.759
You've been saying that these
past six goes.

10:05.759 --> 10:08.440
Still,
all the more money for the bells.

10:10.519 --> 10:11.679
Ding dong!

10:11.679 --> 10:12.960
Are you busy?

10:14.320 --> 10:17.480
Mervyn Glossop is about, and I think
he's planning to make a scene.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.480
Right, we should warn Jamie.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.080
I'll have three more goes, please.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.320
Oh, dear.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.759
I'll have ten more.

10:31.759 --> 10:34.240
Oh, last of the big spenders!

10:34.240 --> 10:37.879
Bunty! Sorry, I really do want to
win this.

10:37.879 --> 10:40.639
We've come to warn you,
Mervyn Glossop is here.

10:40.639 --> 10:43.360
And he's not exactly a little
ray of sunshine.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.200
Oh, dear.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.840
I've won!

10:46.840 --> 10:48.000
I've won!

10:50.720 --> 10:53.639
Aw! Is that for me?

10:53.639 --> 10:55.159
What?

10:55.159 --> 10:56.480
I was joking!

10:56.480 --> 10:58.240
Of course.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.960
I'll keep an eye out for Mervyn.
I must get to the church.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.960
What is a bell?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.600
For some it is a call to prayer.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.919
For others, merely an irritation
on a Sunday morning.

11:14.919 --> 11:17.840
Our bells have been here
500 years,

11:17.840 --> 11:20.320
having a conversation with God.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.840
And today, we have invited you here
to see how it's done.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.000
Thank you, Mr Cheeseman.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.080
Look to.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.039
The treble is going.

11:29.039 --> 11:30.440
Gone.

BELLS CHIME

11:36.159 --> 11:38.399
Oh, heavens!

11:38.399 --> 11:42.720
Erm, I'm most terribly sorry.
One moment, please.

11:46.519 --> 11:49.240
Well, it must have been
an old rope.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.679
Hello?

11:56.360 --> 11:59.960
Sabotage! I bet it was Mervyn.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.639
When I get hold of him, I'm going to
grab him by the throat, and...

12:02.639 --> 12:04.840
Oh, piggy! Let me help you.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.720
Sorry...

12:06.720 --> 12:08.480
..is...is that blood?

12:18.679 --> 12:20.320
SHOCKED GASPS

12:21.639 --> 12:24.120
Thank you, Constable.

12:27.559 --> 12:29.159
So, Padre.

12:29.159 --> 12:32.000
This time the Grim Reaper
came right to your doorstep.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.679
Indeed.

12:33.679 --> 12:36.080
I've never seen a dead body before.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.159
I don't think I'll be able
to sleep tonight.

12:38.159 --> 12:41.519
He is in eternal sleep.

12:41.519 --> 12:44.200
Perhaps now he will finally
find peace.

12:45.559 --> 12:47.399
Oh, Lordy.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.360
Oh, cripes.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.960
Oh, my Great Aunt Fanny.

12:55.519 --> 12:57.759
What is it? So...

12:57.759 --> 13:00.840
..where did you
go just before we started ringing?

13:00.840 --> 13:02.960
You know where I was.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.879
I went to the belfry
to grease the gudgeons.

13:04.879 --> 13:06.799
You were gone a full half-hour.

13:06.799 --> 13:09.720
Yes, well, I don't like
to rush these things.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.279
Where were you?

13:14.279 --> 13:16.039
No sign of a murder weapon, sir.

13:16.039 --> 13:18.480
Well, it must be somewhere
on church grounds.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.679
There's no way our killer
wandered through the crowds

13:20.679 --> 13:22.879
with a blood-stained dagger
in his hand.

13:22.879 --> 13:25.960
I have rather a lot of
bell-ringers to talk to.

13:27.919 --> 13:30.679
Greasing the gudgeons, you say?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.000
That's right.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.080
And I put some oil on the
pulley-axle.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.759
Did you hear anything from
the chamber beneath you?

13:36.759 --> 13:39.000
Oh, I wasn't there the whole time.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.200
I did also nip to the sacristy.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.639
Where Father Brown keeps his
cassocks and whatnot.

13:43.639 --> 13:46.279
And I went in to wash my hands.

13:46.279 --> 13:49.000
And then I went to the
ringing chamber.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.919
And then we all went upstairs...

13:54.440 --> 13:56.039
..and saw...

13:57.679 --> 14:00.120
So, Mervyn Glossop.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.919
Would you say he had any enemies?

14:02.919 --> 14:05.360
I had nothing against him.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.200
We just had certain
musical differences.

14:10.559 --> 14:14.720
He described you as "a viper in the
nest who was going to destroy

14:14.720 --> 14:16.440
"all the bell-ringers".

14:16.440 --> 14:18.759
People say these things in the
heat of the moment.

14:18.759 --> 14:21.480
Can you account for your whereabouts
in the hour leading up to

14:21.480 --> 14:23.080
this grim discovery?

14:23.080 --> 14:25.600
I went round all the stalls.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.840
I won a teddy bear.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.480
And then I came into the church...

14:31.480 --> 14:33.960
..just to make sure that no
members of the public wandered in

14:33.960 --> 14:35.120
when we were getting ready.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.840
So you would have been somewhere
near the entrance?

14:37.840 --> 14:39.120
That's right.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.720
So who was in the bell-tower?

14:41.720 --> 14:45.240
I was on the ground floor of the
tower, just getting my

14:45.240 --> 14:50.039
thoughts together, and praying,
but I didn't hear anything.

14:50.039 --> 14:53.919
A surprising number of your
colleagues failed to hear anything.

14:53.919 --> 14:57.240
Must be spending so much time
with those bells.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.159
Yes. Now, we're going to have to
take everybody's fingerprints,

15:00.159 --> 15:02.159
though I notice you're wearing
gloves.

15:03.559 --> 15:05.120
That's right.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.799
Can you take them off, please?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.279
Mrs Sims!

15:12.320 --> 15:13.679
Of course.

15:15.279 --> 15:18.919
I don't very often
take them off, because,

15:18.919 --> 15:20.480
well...

15:20.480 --> 15:24.480
..just before he was arrested last
year, my husband gave me a little...

15:26.320 --> 15:27.440
..present.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.840
He often used to hurt me,
when I stood up to him.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.000
And on this occasion,
he put my hands in a hot chip pan.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.480
I am so sorry.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.720
Don't apologise!

15:46.840 --> 15:49.240
I have to put wool fat on them,

15:49.240 --> 15:52.240
and I use the gloves
as a kind of bandage.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.759
It can be quite painful,
ringing a bell,

15:55.759 --> 15:58.759
but at least now
I'm in control of the pain.

15:58.759 --> 16:00.759
And I am a shy person...

16:02.080 --> 16:04.840
..but I like to think that
the treble bell is my voice...

16:06.240 --> 16:11.279
..and it rings out across the
hills, all the way to HMP Wynchurch,

16:11.279 --> 16:13.720
where he's rotting in his cell!

16:16.399 --> 16:17.799
And it says to him...

16:19.159 --> 16:20.960
.."You did not beat me.

16:22.279 --> 16:24.120
"I am still here."

16:31.200 --> 16:32.240
So...

16:33.320 --> 16:36.240
..if you were on the ground floor,
praying,

16:36.240 --> 16:38.519
who would have been above you?

16:38.519 --> 16:40.159
No, I was not.

16:40.159 --> 16:43.840
I knew Miss Thundersby was checking
the bells, so I left it to her.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.399
And where exactly were you?

16:46.399 --> 16:49.600
I went to the sacristy for some
peace and quiet,

16:49.600 --> 16:52.279
and then I went straight from there
to the ringing chamber.

16:52.279 --> 16:55.399
The sacristy?
And was anyone there with you?

16:55.399 --> 16:57.480
No, I was alone the whole time.

16:59.240 --> 17:03.480
We believe Mr Glossop was stabbed in
the heart with a large blade.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.799
You are a farmer, are you not?

17:05.799 --> 17:08.920
I am a farm labourer,
though it is not my farm.

17:08.920 --> 17:13.240
Nevertheless, you must have access
to lots of sharp implements -

17:13.240 --> 17:15.920
scythes and sickles and so forth.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.759
No, I do not!
This is the 20th century.

17:19.759 --> 17:21.400
I use a tractor.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.598
Calm down, Mr Rowe.
I'm only asking a simple question.

17:27.279 --> 17:30.880
So, who was the last person
to see him alive?

17:30.880 --> 17:33.160
That would have been his murderer.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.599
I meant before that!
Well, it was me, actually.

17:35.599 --> 17:37.880
The bell-ringers were getting
ready,

17:37.880 --> 17:40.839
and he made some odd remarks
to them, pointing out that they

17:40.839 --> 17:44.720
had a microphone, and that he hoped
they'd get a good crowd.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.039
Mr Glossop was a keen
collector of secrets.

17:48.039 --> 17:50.680
He made it clear that he knew
certain things

17:50.680 --> 17:52.200
about his fellow ringers.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.079
He might have been about
to reveal them.

17:55.079 --> 17:58.839
Did Mr Glossop take his secrets
to the grave with him,

17:58.839 --> 18:02.359
or did he perhaps keep a diary?

18:04.160 --> 18:05.839
Sorry, ma'am, I can't let you in.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.480
Looks like the boys in blue
have beaten us to it.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.319
And the girls, too.

18:11.319 --> 18:13.720
Mervyn was a dear friend of mine,

18:13.720 --> 18:17.640
he wouldn't want lots of
strangers trampling round his house.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.480
Someone wants to get her gloves
on Mervyn's secrets.

18:20.480 --> 18:25.119
Mrs Sims was very keen to know
Miss Thundersby's whereabouts.

18:25.119 --> 18:27.440
I get the impression
each suspects the other.

18:29.039 --> 18:31.039
Hello, Father!
Morning, Sergeant.

18:31.039 --> 18:32.480
We've just made an arrest.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.440
And as he's a parishioner,
I thought you might want a word.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.519
Excuse me.

18:39.079 --> 18:43.559
Ah, Padre! Come to offer some crumbs
of comfort to our killer?

18:43.559 --> 18:46.359
Are you sure you have
the right man, Inspector?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.000
Undoubtedly.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.720
Having failed to find the murder
weapon at the church,

18:50.720 --> 18:52.759
we took our metal detectors
to Tatton Farm.

18:52.759 --> 18:57.559
And there, buried in the yard,
was a blood-stained sickle.

18:57.559 --> 19:00.480
Even if this sickle
IS the murder weapon

19:00.480 --> 19:02.599
how do you know who buried it?

19:02.599 --> 19:06.200
It was found at
Enoch Rowe's place of work!

19:06.200 --> 19:09.519
And now it is in
this police station.

19:09.519 --> 19:12.640
So presumably you'll be arresting
Sergeant Goodfellow?

19:15.599 --> 19:17.079
On your feet please, sir.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
I'll be right outside
if you need me, Father.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.799
Thank you, Sergeant. Oh!

19:29.559 --> 19:32.039
Have you come to read the
last rites?

19:32.039 --> 19:34.519
I've come to help in any way I can.

19:34.519 --> 19:36.079
Did you kill Mervyn Glossop?

19:37.119 --> 19:38.319
I am not a murderer!

19:39.519 --> 19:42.640
Although I am fairly sure
that I will hang for it.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.960
What makes you say that?

19:43.960 --> 19:46.079
Inspector Mallory
has made up his mind.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.680
Oh...

19:48.680 --> 19:51.319
He found an old shirt of mine,
with blood on it.

19:51.319 --> 19:55.640
My own blood, from a nosebleed,
but what does he care?

19:55.640 --> 19:58.920
The Inspector
sometimes comes to a conclusion,

19:58.920 --> 20:01.720
and then looks
for evidence to support it.

20:02.759 --> 20:06.160
When I was growing up in Trinidad,
my teachers used to say

20:06.160 --> 20:09.599
there are three people you can
always trust -

20:09.599 --> 20:13.880
The good Lord, your mother,
and a policeman.

20:18.559 --> 20:21.440
Yes, well,
two out of three isn't bad.

20:22.759 --> 20:24.480
And then,

20:24.480 --> 20:26.799
when I come to England,

20:26.799 --> 20:30.039
I lived in a room with
six other West Indians.

20:30.039 --> 20:33.359
And if any of my roommates
committed a crime, the police would

20:33.359 --> 20:38.480
come and arrest us all, because in
their eyes, we all look the same.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.720
That must have been
very hurtful, Mr Rowe.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.119
I tried not to take it to heart.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.240
I just worked hard,
kept my nose clean

20:47.240 --> 20:49.400
and carried
on sending money home.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.599
Your mother must be very
proud of you.

20:51.599 --> 20:53.000
She was.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.640
Until she passed away last year.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.000
You have my condolences.

20:58.519 --> 21:00.279
My mother taught me so many things.

21:01.559 --> 21:06.240
She said, "You should always look
people in the eye,

21:06.240 --> 21:10.319
"because the eyes
are the gateway to the soul."

21:10.319 --> 21:11.359
Good advice.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.880
And I will look you in the eye,
and say I will look into this,

21:17.880 --> 21:19.640
and I will find the truth.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.000
There you are. How is he?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.119
I would say the fight has almost
gone out of him.

21:30.119 --> 21:33.000
So it's up to us to do
battle on his behalf.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.880
I came as soon as I heard.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.000
Ah, a banana.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.240
Yes! A banana.

21:39.640 --> 21:43.359
The police say Mr Glossop was
stabbed to death with a sickle.

21:43.359 --> 21:45.960
That's very hard to do
with a curved blade.

21:45.960 --> 21:50.079
And Mr Rowe, being a practical man,
would have gone for the throat.

21:50.079 --> 21:52.359
So it must have been
one of the others.

21:52.359 --> 21:55.519
Yes, and they are a very
tight-knit group.

21:57.839 --> 22:01.920
So, Bunty,
how are we going to infiltrate it?

22:03.440 --> 22:08.039
OK, now, it's not about strength
or speed or stamina.

22:08.039 --> 22:09.680
It's all about technique.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.319
I see.
The bell is on a wheel.

22:12.319 --> 22:15.759
And when you pull, you'll feel when
it's about to go off.

22:15.759 --> 22:19.880
At which point you grab
this rope to secure it.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.279
It's a lot more complicated
than I thought.

22:22.279 --> 22:23.759
You'll soon develop a rhythm.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.720
BELL RINGS

22:28.839 --> 22:29.880
Well done!

22:31.920 --> 22:33.960
I knew you could do it.

22:33.960 --> 22:38.599
Bunty's done dressage, and archery -
ringing a bell must be a doddle.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.599
OK, now, if we try
ringing a round...

22:42.599 --> 22:44.799
OK, Phoebe, you can be treble.

22:44.799 --> 22:47.240
Oh, jolly Dee.
Bunty, you're number two.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.720
I'm three. And Ruth, if you take the
tenor.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.319
But I always come after Phoebe.

22:51.319 --> 22:53.759
I know, but sometimes
you come in a bit too quick,

22:53.759 --> 22:55.920
and I'm keen to see if we can get
our timings right.

22:57.079 --> 23:01.160
Treble. Look too,
The treble is going - gone.

23:02.319 --> 23:03.519
Two.

23:03.519 --> 23:04.559
Three.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.079
I'll go and have a word.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.039
Do you have a particular
grievance with the angels?

23:28.039 --> 23:29.119
I'm sorry, Father.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.000
It's just all been a bit fraught,
with all this death and whatnot.

23:36.119 --> 23:39.319
I noticed you were especially upset
when your friend

23:39.319 --> 23:41.680
began to praise Miss Windermere.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.359
It can be hard, when someone we have
feelings for

23:44.359 --> 23:47.000
makes a fuss of someone else.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.559
Feelings? What do you mean?

23:49.559 --> 23:54.799
I think we both know, and I can
assure you I have no wish to judge.

23:56.559 --> 23:57.680
Oh, Lord.

23:59.599 --> 24:02.319
I've tried so hard to keep
it a secret,

24:02.319 --> 24:05.039
but I suppose it's just written
all over my silly old face.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.519
Is Mrs Sims aware of your feelings?

24:08.519 --> 24:10.960
Oh, no. Oh, never.

24:12.079 --> 24:14.119
No, I'd die if she knew. Why?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.279
Well, it's wrong, isn't it?
It's in the Bible.

24:16.279 --> 24:19.440
The Bible also says it's wrong
to wear clothes of mixed fibres.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.640
But theologians tend to ignore that.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.680
THEY LAUGH

24:25.799 --> 24:26.839
SHE SOBS

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Oh, gosh!

24:32.359 --> 24:34.799
It's been so hard
to keep these feelings inside.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.119
I've read books about it
in the library,

24:42.119 --> 24:44.240
so I know there's a name
for people like me.

24:45.519 --> 24:49.720
I'm an invert. An unspeakable of
the Radclyffe Hall persuasion.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.880
I'm a sister of Sappho.

24:51.880 --> 24:55.200
Oh, who did you say your
sister was?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.799
HIGHPITCHED WHISTLING

24:56.799 --> 25:00.720
Perhaps you should pour Mrs McCarthy
a cup of hot, sweet tea.

25:02.519 --> 25:04.920
I don't know what this world
is coming to.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.720
I mean, it's against all the
laws of nature.

25:08.720 --> 25:12.880
To be accurate, Miss Thundersby
only expressed a deep yearning.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.599
But I know that she has tortured
herself for years,

25:17.599 --> 25:20.839
and I see no reason to add
to her torment.

25:20.839 --> 25:23.039
If Ruth was tormented by her...

25:24.119 --> 25:28.319
..her tendencies, and Mervyn knew
about it,

25:28.319 --> 25:32.720
well, that would be a very good
reason for her to...silence him.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.160
The lab have confirmed the blood
on his shirt is not

25:35.160 --> 25:37.839
the same blood group as Mervyn's.
We've only got one bit of evidence,

25:37.839 --> 25:39.480
and it's highly possible
it was planted.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.400
We have to have someone in the
cells!

25:41.400 --> 25:43.119
We can't just brush it under
the carpet.

25:43.119 --> 25:45.079
The funeral's tomorrow.

25:45.079 --> 25:47.440
I say we let Enoch go,
under observation.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.880
You never know, sir -
he might do something rash.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.160
Or he could even lead us
to the real killer.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.839
CHURCH BELL RINGS

25:59.519 --> 26:03.880
Anima eius, et animae
omnium fidelium defunctorum,

26:03.880 --> 26:07.880
per misericordiam Dei
requiescant in pace.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.079
ALL: Amen.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.519
I'm so pleased you could come.

26:12.519 --> 26:15.599
We know you had nothing to do with
that awful business.

26:15.599 --> 26:17.480
I'm not sure everyone knows that.

26:19.559 --> 26:21.440
Enoch, how, are you?

26:21.440 --> 26:24.759
Not good. I can feel people's eyes
burning into me.

26:25.799 --> 26:27.559
Well, if you ever need to escape,

26:27.559 --> 26:30.640
you're always welcome at the
presbytery. Thank you, Father.

26:31.839 --> 26:34.160
I must say hello to Mervyn's aunt.
Of course.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.920
I am so sorry for your loss.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.079
Thank you for...
Thank you, that's very kind.

26:47.599 --> 26:51.559
Well, I do hope a few more souls
turn up at my funeral.

26:51.559 --> 26:53.240
Most of these are police.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.559
Good. Hopefully they've all
left Mr Glossop's house.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.240
3.5 seconds.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.200
Oh, there's an awfully musty
smell in here!

27:11.200 --> 27:14.279
It's as though no-one's opened
a window in here for 500 years.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.400
Mr Glossop always tended
to linger in the shadows.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.559
I didn't know
he was a theatre-goer.

27:23.599 --> 27:25.680
The London Opera Company.

27:25.680 --> 27:29.279
I think he procured this
for research purposes.

27:29.279 --> 27:33.799
"Musical arrangements
by George J Cheeseman."

27:33.799 --> 27:35.880
That's got to be Jamie.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.400
I wonder why he dropped the George?

27:38.400 --> 27:41.160
Perhaps, like the others,
he has a secret past.

27:48.839 --> 27:51.079
Oh, now...

27:51.079 --> 27:56.240
This is interesting,
it's a letter to Mervyn from Phoebe.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.200
Father?

28:00.640 --> 28:03.440
Mr Glossop had a collection of
farming paraphernalia.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.559
Including a sickle,
which has been removed. Hang on!

28:07.559 --> 28:12.319
I saw Mervyn with a sack
with something in it at the fete.

28:12.319 --> 28:16.119
Perhaps he was carrying the
instrument of his own demise.

28:16.119 --> 28:17.839
RATTLING

28:34.319 --> 28:35.720
Well done, Phoebe.

28:36.759 --> 28:40.480
Now stay calm,
and don't make a...

28:40.480 --> 28:42.359
Aagghh!!

28:42.359 --> 28:45.319
Hello! What brings you here?

28:45.319 --> 28:46.359
Um...

28:47.480 --> 28:50.519
I just came to tidy the place.

28:50.519 --> 28:52.359
Mervyn was very house-proud.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.880
You didn't come to retrieve
anything?

28:56.880 --> 28:57.920
No.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.880
"Dear Mervyn, I am writing to beg
you to see sense.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.519
"I know you don't get on with Jamie,
but why destroy our wonderful group?

29:06.519 --> 29:11.279
"Of course, you could easily ruin
us, you know all our secrets."

29:11.279 --> 29:13.559
Mr Glossop accused you of lying.

29:13.559 --> 29:15.960
Must have been a significant
lie to ruin you.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.039
Did this lie take place in court?

29:25.599 --> 29:29.440
As you know, my husband was arrested
for armed robbery last year.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.880
Get off me!

29:30.880 --> 29:33.279
It came as a complete surprise.

29:33.279 --> 29:36.559
Really, I had no idea.
But it was a relief.

29:36.559 --> 29:39.599
Gotcha!
He'd done some awful things to me.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.359
Though, when it came to court,
they asked me

29:43.359 --> 29:45.200
had I been with him
on a certain day?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.400
And, well...

29:47.920 --> 29:49.319
..the answer was yes.

29:50.519 --> 29:54.000
I'd been helping him fix the car.
Passing the spanners.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.759
But that was the day of the robbery.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.480
Did you lie under oath?

29:59.880 --> 30:02.240
Oh, dear God, please forgive me!

30:02.240 --> 30:04.079
God will forgive you,

30:04.079 --> 30:05.319
if you truly repent.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.319
I thought perhaps that they
had the wrong date,

30:11.319 --> 30:15.519
but the money was found under
our bed, so it must have been him.

30:15.519 --> 30:19.240
Do you think Mr Glossop
somehow found out you were lying?

30:19.240 --> 30:21.200
He must have done.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.799
But I thought he was on my side.

30:24.799 --> 30:26.279
He was very kind to me.

30:26.279 --> 30:27.480
Mervyn?!

30:27.480 --> 30:28.920
Oh, yes.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.599
The thing is - a few days after my
husband went to prison,

30:32.599 --> 30:36.000
I received a plain brown envelope,
full of money.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.119
It wasn't a fortune,
but enough to buy some groceries.

30:39.119 --> 30:40.640
Was there a note attached? No.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.279
And the money carried on coming.

30:44.279 --> 30:46.519
And you believe
Mr Glossop was responsible?

30:46.519 --> 30:48.839
Of course.

30:48.839 --> 30:51.279
He lived just over the road from me.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.079
When I asked him, he denied it.

30:54.079 --> 30:55.400
But if it wasn't him...

30:57.359 --> 30:58.599
..who was it?

30:58.599 --> 31:00.559
Ruth? Possibly.

31:00.559 --> 31:05.319
Mervyn Glossop never struck me
as the anonymous gift giving type.

31:05.319 --> 31:08.200
So, we know Mrs Sims lied in court.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.680
And we know that Ruth
prefers ladies to gentlemen.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.799
What are the other secrets?
Mallory!

31:14.960 --> 31:16.200
Padre!

31:19.599 --> 31:23.000
Inspector. Why do I sense you are
the bearer of bad news.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.599
This is not bad.
This is catastrophic.

31:25.599 --> 31:27.160
Oh...

31:27.160 --> 31:29.319
Where is Enoch Rowe?

31:29.319 --> 31:32.240
We've just been to Tatton Farm,
and it seems that he's scarpered.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.440
What?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.559
He has gone into hiding.

31:35.559 --> 31:36.839
But when I find him,

31:36.839 --> 31:40.839
those bells won't be the only things
swinging at the end of a rope!

31:42.359 --> 31:43.640
No sign of him.

31:45.039 --> 31:48.960
It was an outside chance, but I
thought he might have come here to
seek sanctuary.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.000
Where exactly did you find the body?

31:51.000 --> 31:55.680
Here. Although the trail of blood
suggests he died here.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.680
And that was where Miss Thundersby
tripped and fell.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.079
Right.

32:01.079 --> 32:04.759
THAT is the sack that Mervyn
was carrying at the fete.

32:04.759 --> 32:08.039
And it almost certainly contained
the weapon that killed him.

32:08.039 --> 32:10.359
He carried his own murder weapon?!

32:10.359 --> 32:14.559
I think he also came here
to cut the bell-ropes,

32:14.559 --> 32:17.079
thereby ruining the performance.

32:17.079 --> 32:21.039
And someone caught him at it,
and ruined him instead.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.839
And what about the sickle?

32:22.839 --> 32:26.839
How did the killer get it past
the police and everyone else to

32:26.839 --> 32:28.319
bury it on Tatton Farm?

32:28.319 --> 32:30.640
I know exactly how they did it.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.200
How? What if it was inside
something?

32:33.200 --> 32:36.400
Something big and soft and fluffy.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.079
Like a teddy bear.

32:39.599 --> 32:43.359
Father Brown!
To what do I owe the pleasure?

32:43.359 --> 32:47.279
I wanted to talk to all the ringers
at this difficult time.

32:47.279 --> 32:50.000
That's very kind! Please.
Take a seat.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.680
Sorry.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.720
Hold on.

32:57.519 --> 33:00.279
And I wanted to say thank you
for all the work you've done

33:00.279 --> 33:03.319
with our ringers. You
really do have a remarkable talent.

33:03.319 --> 33:04.559
Thank you very much.

33:04.559 --> 33:08.119
Although I was intrigued as to
why you came to our village after

33:08.119 --> 33:10.599
your glittering career in London.

33:10.599 --> 33:12.759
Although that was under
another name.

33:15.279 --> 33:17.119
George J Cheeseman.

33:19.119 --> 33:20.839
Have you been talking to my uncle?

33:20.839 --> 33:23.240
I have made a number of enquiries.

33:23.240 --> 33:27.160
Then you'll know that I left London
under a dark cloud.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.960
The thing is -
I can be a bit obsessive.

33:31.839 --> 33:34.799
Once upon a time the obsession
was music, but last year,

33:34.799 --> 33:36.480
I became obsessed with poker.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.960
I played every night of the week,

33:38.960 --> 33:41.480
and I took some money from the opera
company to pay for it.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.759
Oh.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.720
Uncle Raymond bailed me out.

33:46.839 --> 33:50.440
Of course. I did wonder whether you
had an addictive personality when I

33:50.440 --> 33:52.039
saw you trying to win that bear.

33:53.839 --> 33:55.759
I really did want to win it.

33:55.759 --> 33:57.880
It's for my niece, in London.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.039
Can I have a look at him?

34:01.039 --> 34:02.400
If you like.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.440
BEAR WHEEZES

34:14.880 --> 34:17.480
Sorry? Has this got something to
do with the murder?

34:17.480 --> 34:18.880
It had crossed my mind, yes.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.960
But I believe this bear is innocent.

34:27.639 --> 34:30.599
I have discovered
Mr Cheeseman's secret,

34:30.599 --> 34:32.599
but I do not think
he would kill for it.

34:32.599 --> 34:34.599
Oh, thank goodness.

34:34.599 --> 34:35.960
Good day, Father.

34:35.960 --> 34:39.079
It must all go back
to the events of last year.

34:39.079 --> 34:40.920
Robbery. The perjury.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.880
The mysterious gifts of money.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.159
Mr Glossop knew all the facts,
and was about to reveal them.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.119
Until someone stopped him.

34:49.119 --> 34:50.639
Mr Glossop...

34:50.639 --> 34:52.559
..was a gossip.

34:52.559 --> 34:55.880
You could see it
in his beady little eyes.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.719
His eyes. Yes. Yes.

35:00.639 --> 35:03.000
Where are we going?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.440
To see the world through
Mr Glossop's eyes.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.039
And there's her front door.

35:21.039 --> 35:23.239
One of us needs to
keep watch at all times.

35:23.239 --> 35:26.840
What makes you so sure
that we're going to see anything?

35:26.840 --> 35:30.599
Some crimes are about evil,
this one is about kindness.

35:30.599 --> 35:33.559
Whoever's been leaving
Mrs Sims secret gifts

35:33.559 --> 35:35.320
doesn't want to see her destitute.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.639
So they will return.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.519
Right, tea.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.639
CLOCK CHIMES

35:50.639 --> 35:52.079
COCKEREL CROWS

36:00.039 --> 36:01.239
Five o'clock.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.440
It's your turn.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.000
If you say so.

36:09.320 --> 36:12.719
I still think this is
a wild goose chase.

36:12.719 --> 36:15.000
Though,
very little chasing involved.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.199
And probably no geese.

36:17.199 --> 36:18.760
But what do I know?

36:18.760 --> 36:21.599
I'm just the tea lady, apparently.

36:24.239 --> 36:25.559
SHE GASPS

36:25.559 --> 36:26.599
Mrs McCarthy?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.239
There is someone.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.440
Enoch Rowe, I presume?

36:44.320 --> 36:47.519
Father! Please! I am not safe here.

36:47.519 --> 36:48.719
Then come with me.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.119
Mrs McCarthy, do we have any food
left for our visitor?

36:59.119 --> 37:02.119
Would you care for
a fish paste sandwich?

37:02.119 --> 37:04.239
No, thank you, Mrs McCarthy.

37:04.239 --> 37:06.800
Perhaps you could keep a
look out for the police.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.079
Of course.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.760
Take a seat.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.800
Your mother gave you
very good advice -

37:22.800 --> 37:24.960
always look into people's eyes,

37:24.960 --> 37:27.039
for the eyes
are the gateway of the soul.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.760
When they found Mr Glossop,
his eyes were closed.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.639
Almost as if the killer couldn't
bear being stared at

37:35.639 --> 37:38.039
by those judgmental eyes.

37:38.039 --> 37:40.719
And, at the funeral,
you hugged his aunt.

37:40.719 --> 37:42.360
You wanted to comfort her,

37:42.360 --> 37:46.840
but were you afraid that she'd look
into your eyes and see a killer?

37:48.400 --> 37:50.440
Why would I want to kill Mervyn?

37:50.440 --> 37:52.599
I can think of many reasons.

37:52.599 --> 37:56.239
The bell-ringers were a very
kind group of people,

37:56.239 --> 37:59.679
and when they found out that one
of their number was being harmed

37:59.679 --> 38:03.159
by her husband,
you did all you could to help.

38:07.079 --> 38:09.159
Mr Glossop kept a scrapbook.

38:09.159 --> 38:12.599
"On Tuesday morning, the post office
was robbed by a man wearing a

38:12.599 --> 38:15.559
"mask, a scarf and leather gloves."

38:17.360 --> 38:22.920
The robber was very, very careful
to conceal every inch of his skin.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.679
And then he took the money
to Mr and Mrs Sims' house.

38:27.400 --> 38:32.840
But I wonder how he got in, if,
as I believe, he didn't live there?

38:32.840 --> 38:35.000
Perhaps he picked the lock,

38:35.000 --> 38:38.559
or perhaps there
was a key under the flowerpot.

38:38.559 --> 38:41.880
But to turn the key,
he'd have to take off his glove.

38:45.159 --> 38:46.320
I think Mervyn saw you.

38:46.320 --> 38:50.679
And then he saw you leaving
secret presents.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.639
You told me you used to send money
home to your mother.

38:57.679 --> 39:01.159
When she died,
that must have left a void.

39:01.159 --> 39:04.159
Yes. More than words can say.

39:04.159 --> 39:06.599
Did you have feelings for Mrs Sims?

39:06.599 --> 39:09.639
The only thing I felt was fear.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.559
That if I did not help,
her husband would beat her to death.

39:14.119 --> 39:18.079
As usual, you acted
with the best of intentions.

39:18.079 --> 39:21.320
But now Mervyn
had two secrets on you.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.920
The day of the fete,
you went to check on the bells.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.920
And Mervyn went to cut the ropes.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.639
Mervyn...

39:32.679 --> 39:33.920
Put down the sickle.

39:33.920 --> 39:37.000
Or what will you do?
Tell your precious Phoebe

39:37.000 --> 39:40.480
when you sneak to her house
in the wee small hours?

39:40.480 --> 39:43.840
You're a thief and a liar!

39:43.840 --> 39:46.159
There was a struggle.

39:46.159 --> 39:47.800
I saw the mark on his wrist,

39:47.800 --> 39:50.239
where you squeezed the sickle
from his hand.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.079
It is true!

39:57.079 --> 39:59.199
But I did not kill him.

39:59.199 --> 40:00.920
I know you didn't.

40:00.920 --> 40:06.280
You are calm, and thoughtful, but
Mervyn was reckless and impulsive.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.639
You were holding the sickle,
and he ran at you to grab it.

40:09.639 --> 40:13.559
But he tripped,
exactly where Ms Thundersby tripped.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.800
He fell.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.280
And the weapon was in my hand.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.039
Who was going to believe me?

40:21.039 --> 40:22.559
DOGS BARK

40:22.559 --> 40:24.360
The police are here.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.519
It is the end!

40:25.519 --> 40:29.840
No, my friend, it is a new chapter,
and you have a choice.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.559
You can run and
you may get away unharmed.

40:32.559 --> 40:33.960
Or you can give yourself up,

40:33.960 --> 40:38.320
and I will do everything I can to
make sure you have a fair hearing.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.320
They will destroy me.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.760
And what of Phoebe.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.119
What will happen to her when they
find out she lied?

40:44.119 --> 40:48.199
Mrs Sims was driven to the edge
of reason by her husband.

40:48.199 --> 40:50.079
Now is the time for truth.

40:50.079 --> 40:51.519
And if you run,

40:51.519 --> 40:53.280
will you ever find peace?

41:08.639 --> 41:11.480
Inspector!
We have a surprise for you!

41:11.480 --> 41:14.239
Perhaps we can offer the police
some refreshments.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.079
What's going on?

41:16.079 --> 41:18.159
This had better not
be one of your tricks.

41:20.679 --> 41:24.159
Hello, Inspector.
Would you like a cup of tea?

41:28.119 --> 41:33.280
Poor Enoch. Whatever he did, I'm
sure he didn't mean to harm Mervyn.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.760
Yes, well,
if he'd been a bit more honest,

41:35.760 --> 41:39.320
he wouldn't be in such a scrape.
Honesty?

41:39.320 --> 41:42.559
I think that's something we could
all use a little bit more of.

41:42.559 --> 41:44.039
What do you mean?

41:44.039 --> 41:46.639
Where were you,
the hour before Mervyn's death?

41:46.639 --> 41:50.079
Well, if you must know,
I won some eau-de-cologne and...

41:51.280 --> 41:53.760
So I just had to nip
to the sacristy

41:53.760 --> 41:56.719
and dab a bit behind my ears.
Whatever for?

41:59.599 --> 42:04.280
Well, you asked if we could sing
together, cheek to cheek,

42:04.280 --> 42:07.280
and I was worried
I was just a bit whiffy.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.800
Oh, you silly thing!

42:11.639 --> 42:14.039
You mustn't worry about that.

42:14.039 --> 42:17.639
We've known each other
for such a long time.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.079
And you must know
how I feel about you.

42:23.119 --> 42:24.159
No.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.719
I don't know.

42:34.559 --> 42:36.400
Oh, I was just... Mrs M!

42:36.400 --> 42:38.800
Oh, golly!
I didn't know anyone was watching.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.679
Forgive us for intruding, but it is
good to see you both so happy.

42:42.679 --> 42:44.320
Isn't that right, Mrs McCarthy?

42:46.519 --> 42:48.559
Yes. If you say so.

42:48.559 --> 42:51.360
It's ridiculous. You're just getting
to know someone,

42:51.360 --> 42:54.320
and then they're gone...
Penelope! Mr Cheeseman!

42:54.320 --> 42:57.400
Everything all right?
No. Not really.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.039
Jamie is leaving Kembleford.
PHOEBE: What?

43:00.039 --> 43:02.199
It's true, I'm afraid.

43:02.199 --> 43:03.719
I'm London-bound.

43:03.719 --> 43:05.559
What does London have that we don't?

43:05.559 --> 43:06.760
Nothing.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.199
But I've realised I'm not
cut out for Kembleford.

43:09.199 --> 43:11.280
Is there nothing we can do
to persuade you?

43:11.280 --> 43:12.599
'Fraid not.

43:12.599 --> 43:13.679
I'm on the 4.42.

43:15.119 --> 43:17.320
Then we'll ring you on your way.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.840
Come on, Mrs M.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.920
What? What?

43:23.280 --> 43:24.639
Goodbye, Jamie.

43:31.320 --> 43:33.719
Are you sure you're leaving
at the right time?

43:33.719 --> 43:35.719
I am.

43:35.719 --> 43:38.440
Plus, my uncle has found me
a teaching post.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.800
And you don't want to argue
with Uncle Raymond.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.320
Indeed. Perhaps your work here is
done.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.519
Thank you, Father.

43:45.519 --> 43:47.679
No, thank you, Mr Cheeseman.

43:47.679 --> 43:49.360
Bon voyage!

43:49.360 --> 43:51.320
BEAR WHEEZES, BELLS RING OUT

44:00.280 --> 44:02.920
BELLS CONTINUE TO RING OUT
