CAPTAIN AMERICA: Come on,
soldier. You can do this.

00:06.554 --> 00:09.220
Hey, Captain America.

00:09.392 --> 00:11.728
Is everything okay?

00:11.931 --> 00:13.571
Maybe you need to
get out for a bit.

00:13.728 --> 00:15.243
I'm busy right now,
Hawkeye.

00:15.368 --> 00:17.951
Yeah, sure.
We can just hang,

00:17.997 --> 00:21.646
watch an old movie,
make some popcorn... Not today.

00:21.747 --> 00:23.722
What's so important?

00:25.208 --> 00:28.208
I'm trying to draw a picture
of my father, but I...

00:28.357 --> 00:30.122
I just can't seem
to get it right.

00:30.275 --> 00:31.880
Why don't you
just grab a photo

00:31.950 --> 00:33.177
and, you know, trace it?

00:33.278 --> 00:35.177
I don't have a photo of my dad.

00:35.318 --> 00:37.622
I used to carry one
in my wallet, but lost it years ago

00:37.693 --> 00:39.669
during a break-in at my camp.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.950
I thought I could remember
what he looked like.

00:42.115 --> 00:45.794
Okay, then why not feed the deets
into Friday's police-sketch algorithm?

00:45.943 --> 00:47.685
Friday makes everyone
look like a criminal.

00:47.841 --> 00:49.466
FRIDAY:
<i>And I'm very good at it.</i>

00:49.575 --> 00:51.763
Well, I'll be in the gym.

00:51.872 --> 00:54.240
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Fighting bots that look like Red Skull.

00:54.349 --> 00:56.388

00:59.435 --> 01:00.990
(GROANS)

01:01.122 --> 01:02.646
Friday, maybe
I should get out.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.083
What's on the police scanner?

01:04.129 --> 01:05.716
<i>Hubcap-stealer on Bleecker,</i>

01:05.802 --> 01:07.716
<i>dock alarm

01:07.802 --> 01:11.138
That one. My dad used to
take me fishing on those docks.

01:11.255 --> 01:13.341
Maybe it'll jar
a few memories loose.

Heinrich Zemo?

He died during the war.
How can he be here?

02:18.818 --> 02:19.959
(LAUGHS)

02:20.045 --> 02:21.796
My traitorous team,
the Thunderbolts,

02:21.842 --> 02:25.131
taught me that I can trust
no one except family.

02:26.529 --> 02:28.795
Which is why
he brought me here.

02:28.943 --> 02:30.662
Across time itself.

02:30.828 --> 02:32.350
But how?

02:32.545 --> 02:34.490
Have you forgotten
your recent battle

02:34.553 --> 02:36.123
with the time-traveler, Kang?

02:36.248 --> 02:38.412
You recovered fragments
of his future tech.

02:38.521 --> 02:41.209
Enough to communicate
with my father in the past

02:41.271 --> 02:43.881
and then build
this time machine.

02:44.053 --> 02:45.506
Well, you're in
for a disappointment.

02:45.552 --> 02:48.904
Your father was the lowest most
corrupt leader Hydra ever produced.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.943
How dare you!
(GRUNTS)

a great leader!

"Captain America"
from existence.

03:23.615 --> 03:25.199
Uh, sorry, Black Widow.

03:25.246 --> 03:29.277
I'd say something drew him away,
but the joke would be lost on you.

03:29.473 --> 03:31.441
For the record,
this is supposed to be

03:31.496 --> 03:33.066
a party for Cap's birthday.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.394
Can I help it if he was
born on the 4th of July?

03:35.504 --> 03:37.996
Plus, the colors
match his uniform.

03:38.196 --> 03:39.754
He was probably onto us.

03:39.796 --> 03:41.832
He hates celebrating
his birthday.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.621
That's why it's so fun.

03:43.699 --> 03:46.707
Hey.
- (YAWNS) Sorry.

03:46.801 --> 03:50.137
Every minute here is a minute
of genius not expressed.

03:51.293 --> 03:52.762
Okay, forget surprise.

03:52.848 --> 03:55.230
Friday, just tell Cap
to report for cake duty.

03:55.426 --> 03:57.754
FRIDAY: <i>Captain America
has left the building.</i>

03:57.941 --> 04:00.488
Let's go get him.

Forgive me, Captain.

04:02.973 --> 04:03.831
(GRUNTS)

04:03.877 --> 04:05.400
But after crossing decades,

04:05.446 --> 04:08.780
I don't wish to waste
another second on you.

04:09.318 --> 04:10.851
(GRUNTS)

04:11.496 --> 04:12.785
You dare!

04:12.871 --> 04:14.746
Explain yourself.

04:14.933 --> 04:19.370
Father, this man thwarted
the plans of two generations
of Zemos.

04:19.504 --> 04:21.199
He destroyed our legacy.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.414
Made history see us
as nothing but criminals.

04:24.715 --> 04:26.953
We must redeem our name.

04:27.125 --> 04:31.515
We will take over Hydra
once more, then the world.

04:31.609 --> 04:33.312
<i>Und</i> let him live?

04:33.484 --> 04:35.859
Let him watch us destroy
his friends,

04:35.929 --> 04:37.851
his country, and finally,

04:38.054 --> 04:42.125
let the triumph of Zemo
be the last thing he sees.

04:42.289 --> 04:46.437
Your obsession with revenge against
one man has left you short-sighted.

04:46.593 --> 04:50.695
Fortunately, I have been working
on a way to strengthen our ranks

04:50.765 --> 04:53.929
and return the focus
to our legacy.

04:54.045 --> 04:56.437
FALCON: Two Zemos?
Gotta be a trick.

04:56.757 --> 04:58.230
Falcon, help Cap.

04:59.578 --> 05:00.547
I got ya.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.531
You should have known
they would show up.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.726
You are less useful than
the infant you are in my own time.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.289
I can handle them.

05:08.422 --> 05:10.265
I have a better strategy.

05:10.406 --> 05:13.257
Drive them
toward the portal.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.593
Whoa!

05:19.185 --> 05:20.352

05:21.757 --> 05:23.922

05:35.062 --> 05:36.367
Where are they?

05:36.507 --> 05:38.961
You think I would
help you find them?

05:39.132 --> 05:43.398
No, Captain.
Your friends are lost in time.

05:43.578 --> 05:45.101
Don't bother, Captain.

05:45.265 --> 05:47.500
My father sent them
into the past.

05:47.656 --> 05:49.625
They've been swept
into history.

05:49.783 --> 05:53.117
Irrelevant, as are you.

05:56.801 --> 05:58.281
(WHOOSHING)
Huh?

06:03.687 --> 06:07.121
Avengers Tower!
It's gone!

06:07.324 --> 06:10.066
HAWKEYE:
Where are we, Planet Fedora?

06:19.113 --> 06:21.191
We've been sent
backward in time.

06:21.316 --> 06:23.996
And we left Cap to deal
with those guys on his own.

06:24.073 --> 06:26.941
We gotta get back, fast.
Anyone else want to miss

06:26.987 --> 06:30.160
helping Cap take out
one of his greatest enemies?

06:30.293 --> 06:33.160
Bring them back, Zemo.
Never!

06:35.144 --> 06:36.301
(BEEPING)

06:36.371 --> 06:38.418
I'll bring 'em back myself.

06:38.613 --> 06:41.441
(LAUGHING)
By all means, try.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.855
Technical genius
is not your strength.

06:43.902 --> 06:46.066
<i>Und</i> strategy is not yours.

06:46.129 --> 06:50.301
Our legacy hails back to the great
Harbin Zemo of the 15th century,

06:50.434 --> 06:53.152
yet you've reduced us
to fighting one man

06:53.223 --> 06:55.285
in an abandoned warehouse.

06:56.215 --> 06:59.144
Iron Man, Friday,
come in.

06:59.207 --> 07:02.629
HELMUT ZEMO: Tachyons are
very disruptive to communications.

07:02.809 --> 07:04.105
Face it, Captain.

07:04.262 --> 07:06.590
You dare not destroy
the machine.

07:06.723 --> 07:08.973
And you'll never operate it.

07:09.105 --> 07:11.996
Now that none of his friends
are standing in our way,

07:12.090 --> 07:14.785
let us finish
what we started!

07:20.598 --> 07:23.512
I may not be able to operate the
portal and bring my friends back,

07:23.605 --> 07:26.660
but I know someone who can.
(GRUNTS)

07:26.832 --> 07:27.856
(BEEPS)

07:33.052 --> 07:35.941
And in the meantime, you won't
have access to it either.

07:38.137 --> 07:42.090
No! Rogers has taken
the transference cylinder!

07:43.059 --> 07:46.371
Falcon, come on.
Use that brain of yours.

07:46.582 --> 07:49.293
Me? I can't build
a time machine.

07:49.441 --> 07:51.738
You brought Cap back
from Kang's time portal.

07:51.801 --> 07:53.887
You and Tony have
been studying his tech.

07:53.951 --> 07:57.223
Yeah. We barely understand it.
But I know one thing.

07:57.332 --> 08:00.301
The only way to operate that
portal is from the other end.

08:00.637 --> 08:03.271
(GROANS)
You mean our fate depends

08:03.317 --> 08:06.074
on Cap precisely
calibrating and operating

08:06.129 --> 08:10.269
an advanced time portal that
even our tech geniuses don't really get?

08:10.457 --> 08:14.957
Okay. Last time, I was able to pull Cap
back by locking on to a temporal signal.

08:15.074 --> 08:18.059
I might be able to build a time
antenna, a temporal ping.

08:18.105 --> 08:19.887
So, when the portal reopens,

08:19.965 --> 08:22.965
whoever's on the other side
will be able to lock on to us?

08:23.051 --> 08:24.535
I'll need
transmitting equipment.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.338
(VEHICLES APPROACHING)
A lot of it.

08:32.504 --> 08:34.448
Must be
a military base nearby.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.051
Will that do?

08:37.457 --> 08:39.168
TONY: (ON RADIO)
<i>Cap, got your Code Blue.</i>

08:39.222 --> 08:41.090
<i>Give me the high points.</i>

08:41.230 --> 08:43.066
Zemo, back.
Both of them.

08:43.135 --> 08:44.964
Falcon, Widow,
Hawkeye, gone.

08:45.105 --> 08:47.434
Time machine.
Broke off a piece.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.676
TONY: <i>You broke somethin
even I couldn't invent.</i>

08:49.769 --> 08:51.652
<i>Now you want me to fix it.</i>

08:51.840 --> 08:53.572
That sums it up.

09:12.238 --> 09:13.918
We need to find radio gear.

09:14.027 --> 09:16.066
There must be
an equipment room on base.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.754
- Well, let's ask him.
- Hey, kid!

09:19.309 --> 09:21.191
I'm not a kid, sir.

09:22.894 --> 09:24.184
It's him.

09:24.316 --> 09:26.168
Before the Super Soldier
treatment.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.723
Before he became...

09:27.832 --> 09:29.941
Captain America?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.816
That's Steve Rogers?

09:32.973 --> 09:35.402
Can, uh...
Can I help you, Captain?

09:35.488 --> 09:38.002
(CHUCKLES)
He called me "Captain."

09:38.166 --> 09:41.752
(CLEARS THROAT)
Where are you headed, civilian?

09:41.978 --> 09:43.604
On my way to
the recruitment office, sir.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.728
I'm here to enlist.

09:44.845 --> 09:47.048
I want to fight
for my country.

09:47.252 --> 09:51.087
And do you know where
the communications facility is?

09:51.275 --> 09:53.486
Back that way.
I passed it on my way in.

09:53.580 --> 09:56.533
But... Shouldn't you
know that, sir?

09:57.314 --> 09:58.363
Yeah, yeah.

09:58.409 --> 10:00.291
Just testing your powers
of observation.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.822
Good man. I'm sure
your dad would be proud.

10:04.095 --> 10:06.705
I'm sure he would've been. Hmm?
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

10:11.642 --> 10:14.252
The Captain will have warned
the rest of the Avengers by now.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.525
They will be here any minute.
Of course, they will.

10:17.627 --> 10:20.845
Which is why I will be
ready for them.

10:21.056 --> 10:23.220
HELMUT ZEMO: But Rogers
rendered it useless.

10:23.408 --> 10:25.814
HEINRICH ZEMO:
He disabled the portal, fool.

10:25.939 --> 10:29.361
But the time machine can
still scan the time stream.

10:29.517 --> 10:33.173
And I've found something
of more interest than you.

10:38.595 --> 10:41.406
Dibs on Sock-Face.
Both of 'em!

but I know someone who is.

11:01.103 --> 11:02.650
I prefer "Tech genius."

11:02.775 --> 11:04.712

keep them occupied.

Can you find them?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.611
They could be
anywhere in time,

11:15.709 --> 11:17.798
and scanning across time
takes time.

are doing what they can
