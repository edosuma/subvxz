00:32.332 --> 00:33.367
Who's next?

00:35.369 --> 00:36.403
John?

00:37.739 --> 00:38.773
Yes.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.643
Stand up, please.

00:41.676 --> 00:42.777
Okay.

00:44.646 --> 00:46.881
What's the square root of 225?

00:48.248 --> 00:49.283
I don't know.

00:50.685 --> 00:52.286
John, we have been
talking about this

00:52.319 --> 00:53.353
for the last...

00:54.522 --> 00:55.557
Come closer.

00:56.925 --> 00:57.959
Closer.

00:58.927 --> 01:00.360
Okay.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.262
And stop saying okay.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.533
Okay.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.635
Take a look at this.

01:08.536 --> 01:09.571
You understand it?

01:10.370 --> 01:11.405
Yes.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.209
- John.
- Yes.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.047
What's the square root of 225?

01:20.048 --> 01:21.081
I don't know.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.416
Yes, you do, John.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.524
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?

01:29.557 --> 01:31.325
- Are you sure?
- No.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.260
Yes, fifteen.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.297
How did you arrive
at that conclusion?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.701
I don't know.

01:39.734 --> 01:40.768
You don't know?

01:42.971 --> 01:44.471
Fifteen is correct.

01:45.873 --> 01:46.908
Can I sit?

01:47.942 --> 01:48.977
Yes.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.115
Okay, so now
if you pay attention to...

03:21.334 --> 03:22.369
Good night, buddy.

03:23.805 --> 03:25.006
Good night, Dad.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.141
I have to stop by
the office tomorrow,

03:27.175 --> 03:29.452
but if I don't come back late,
maybe we can go hit some balls.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.112
Practice that
two-handed backhand?

03:32.245 --> 03:33.480
Okay.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.549
Good.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.618
Oh, hey, buddy?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.353
What?

03:40.387 --> 03:42.757
When was the last time
you looked under your bed?

03:44.357 --> 03:46.259
I think you better
look under your bed.

09:08.149 --> 09:10.718
- You okay, buddy?
- What's wrong, baby?

09:11.419 --> 09:13.054
Nothing.

09:13.087 --> 09:14.523
Just tired.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.257
Can you pass me the water?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.560
You take the drone for a flight?

09:20.861 --> 09:21.996
Yeah.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.198
I hope you read
the instructions.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.900
Always read the instructions.

09:27.201 --> 09:28.669
Hear that drone has a camera.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.205
The guy at the store said
it had a pretty good one.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.273
4K.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.077
It's the best drone they had.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.916
- This morning I lost it.
- What?

09:41.949 --> 09:44.318
You lost it?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.191
- I was looking for it...
- You lost the drone?

09:47.254 --> 09:48.289
Oh, he's here.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.458
Who's here?

09:53.127 --> 09:54.563
Who's here?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.430
- Josh.
- Who's Josh?

09:56.464 --> 09:59.366
Next time, ask him to
knock and introduce himself.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.102
Okay, I will.
He's just really shy.

10:01.135 --> 10:03.204
- Who's Josh?
- Bye, love you!

10:03.237 --> 10:04.839
Love you too, honey!

10:14.448 --> 10:17.051
- Did you know about this?
- About what?

10:17.084 --> 10:19.521
About this... Josh?

10:19.554 --> 10:20.589
Yes.

10:24.258 --> 10:25.726
I found the hole.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.061
What?

10:27.094 --> 10:29.029
The hole.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.165
On the other side of the trees.

10:31.665 --> 10:32.967
The bunker, you mean?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.668
You found the bunker?

10:35.436 --> 10:36.904
What bunker?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.540
The hole...

10:38.573 --> 10:41.242
The abandoned construction.

10:41.275 --> 10:42.710
That was supposed to be
a bunker.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.378
- A bunker?
- Mm-hm.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.181
What's a bunker?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.317
Sometimes people...

10:51.485 --> 10:53.622
They build these
underground homes.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.688
Why?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.526
In case something bad happens.

11:00.828 --> 11:01.862
Something bad?

11:02.763 --> 11:03.898
Yeah, like a big storm.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.403
Like a bunker is a house
underneath the earth

11:10.505 --> 11:11.906
where you can hide
from a big storm.

11:12.507 --> 11:13.542
Exactly.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.445
They started building it...

11:18.479 --> 11:19.581
When was this?

11:19.614 --> 11:21.849
- But after a week...
- A month.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.318
They worked on it for
at least a month.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.896
I don't think so.
There's almost nothing there.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.164
No, they worked on it
for a month,

11:27.188 --> 11:28.908
and then they ran out of money
or something.

11:29.490 --> 11:31.010
They didn't get
their permits approved.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.693
How long ago?

11:33.694 --> 11:37.031
- Hmm, a few years.
- Five, at least.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.966
Five, already?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.067
My God!

11:41.368 --> 11:42.403
They're gonna finish it?

11:44.539 --> 11:47.174
I don't know. I'm pretty sure
they still own the land.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.045
Who owns the land?

11:51.745 --> 11:52.947
I don't know, buddy.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.248
No idea.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.083
Are you all right, baby?

11:57.851 --> 11:58.886
Yeah.

12:00.254 --> 12:01.288
I'm just tired.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.430
Knees bent.

12:12.366 --> 12:13.968
Come on, John.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.705
Finish the swing.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.374
You got this.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.210
There you go.

12:24.378 --> 12:25.412
Watch it.

12:26.715 --> 12:28.482
Knees bent, John, c'mon.

12:28.516 --> 12:29.783
You know this.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.088
Okay, finish that swing,
follow through.

12:35.356 --> 12:36.423
Focus.

12:56.110 --> 12:57.378
Can you please stop?

12:57.411 --> 12:58.445
Why?

12:59.213 --> 13:00.247
What do you mean "why"?

13:01.482 --> 13:03.518
- Stop!
- Why?

13:03.551 --> 13:04.918
It's annoying.

13:04.952 --> 13:05.986
Okay.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.594
- Okay, what?
- I'll stop.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.705
Don't be an asshole, John,
I'm trying to read.

13:14.729 --> 13:17.431
- What?
- What what?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.584
What are you trying to read?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.602
A biography,
Alexander the Great.

13:20.635 --> 13:22.836
How many pillows do we have?

13:23.672 --> 13:24.905
What?

13:24.938 --> 13:25.973
Why are you reading that?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.375
Book club.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.444
I can help you.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.212
Yes, you can't even stop
the fucking ball!

13:32.246 --> 13:35.215
I can't. It's not that
I don't want to, I can't.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.329
You have to ask my body to.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.052
I literally can't.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.132
Hi, Charlie.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.401
Hey, John.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.670
What are you doing?

15:02.704 --> 15:03.772
I'm weeding.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.440
- Weeding?
- Yep.

15:07.408 --> 15:08.442
What's that?

15:11.679 --> 15:12.747
Taking out the weeds.

15:13.515 --> 15:14.549
Why?

15:15.583 --> 15:16.618
Well, they...

15:17.786 --> 15:19.119
rob the other plants in the soil

15:19.153 --> 15:20.889
of nutrients and water
that they need.

15:21.856 --> 15:22.891
You like the lemonade?

15:24.893 --> 15:25.926
Yeah.

15:27.461 --> 15:28.495
So...

15:30.297 --> 15:31.331
How do you feel?

15:32.534 --> 15:34.334
- Sorry?
- How do you feel?

15:37.237 --> 15:38.305
Good.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.307
Good.

15:41.942 --> 15:42.976
Very good?

15:44.646 --> 15:45.680
Great.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.884
You have a spider on your back.

15:49.918 --> 15:52.019
- What?
- A spider...

15:53.220 --> 15:54.254
On your back.

15:56.724 --> 15:57.826
Oh.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.294
That's a...

16:00.327 --> 16:01.529
That's a garden spider.

16:02.897 --> 16:05.700
Also called a golden spider,
writing spider, corn spider.

16:05.733 --> 16:06.768
It's a good spider.

16:07.836 --> 16:08.969
Keeps the garden clean.

16:10.939 --> 16:12.841
- Clean of what?
- Pests.

16:13.908 --> 16:15.108
- Pests?
- Yep.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.679
- Like rats?
- No.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.446
Fuck!

16:20.314 --> 16:21.348
Fuck.

16:24.519 --> 16:25.787
I'll bring more lemonade.

18:40.788 --> 18:42.255
<i>Stop hitting the...</i>

18:42.289 --> 18:43.625
<i>I'm there.
Stop hitting the ball.</i>

18:43.658 --> 18:44.692
It's your fault.

18:45.593 --> 18:48.261
- No!
- <i>Yes! There you go.</i>

18:48.295 --> 18:50.263
<i>Run after that one.
See your energy disappear.</i>

18:50.297 --> 18:51.331
Go fuck yourself, Pete.

18:54.902 --> 18:57.572
<i>And now a drop shot.
Did you see that?</i>

18:57.605 --> 18:59.707
<i>Of course you saw that.
You're playing against me.</i>

18:59.741 --> 19:01.876
I'm not playing against you.
I'm kicking your ass.

19:01.909 --> 19:02.977
<i>Not for long.</i>

19:03.477 --> 19:05.813
Of the last 377 games,

19:05.847 --> 19:07.280
this being number 378,

19:07.314 --> 19:09.717
I won 312.

19:09.751 --> 19:11.151
- <i>That can't be right.</i>
- It's right.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.787
- <i>That can't be right.</i>
- It's right.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.322
- <i>You kept count?</i>
- Yes.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.525
- <i>That's sad, John.</i>
- You're sad, Pete.

19:21.129 --> 19:23.497
Sliced backhand chip.
Now I charge. Break point.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.335
<i>Boston is sad.</i>

19:28.936 --> 19:30.605
Boston's sad
now that you live there.

19:30.638 --> 19:32.106
- <i>Fuck you.</i>
- Fuck you!

19:32.140 --> 19:33.708
- <i>Fuck you.</i>
- Fuck you!

19:35.677 --> 19:37.210
- <i>Sorry, Mom.</i>
- Sorry, Mom.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.681
<i>Fuck you. Fuck you twice.</i>

19:42.282 --> 19:43.316
Want to play another one?

19:43.851 --> 19:44.919
<i>Sure.</i>

19:47.722 --> 19:50.457
- <i>How's training?</i>
- Good.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.860
- <i>When do they start?</i>
- Three weeks.

19:52.894 --> 19:54.303
- <i>You're not gonna make it.</i>
- I will.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.530
- <i>You won't.</i>
- I will!

19:56.731 --> 19:57.808
- <i>How's your sister?</i>
- Fuck you.

19:57.832 --> 19:59.199
- <i>Fuck you.</i>
- Fuck you.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.903
- <i>Say hi to her.</i>
- Okay. I won't.

20:01.936 --> 20:03.838
- <i>How's your mom?</i>
- Same.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.443
Laurie?

21:19.947 --> 21:20.982
Hey...

27:07.828 --> 27:09.196
You finally cleaned in here.

27:11.098 --> 27:12.266
What did you use?

27:12.299 --> 27:13.501
Show me your pajamas.

27:27.781 --> 27:29.061
Do you wanna go to the bathroom?

27:31.485 --> 27:33.888
- Do you?
- No.

27:35.624 --> 27:37.526
You haven't left the room
since yesterday.

27:38.192 --> 27:39.326
I like the room.

27:40.661 --> 27:42.062
Yeah, of course you do.

27:43.598 --> 27:45.232
You know, when I first saw it
I thought,

27:46.367 --> 27:47.801
"This is Lily's room."

27:48.637 --> 27:49.670
I like it.

27:51.506 --> 27:52.541
You want a banana?

27:54.108 --> 27:55.142
No.

27:55.843 --> 27:56.911
I dreamed something.

27:57.478 --> 27:58.913
You mean you dreamt something?

27:58.946 --> 28:00.314
Yes.

28:00.347 --> 28:01.382
What did you dream?

28:01.982 --> 28:03.317
I was a balloon.

28:04.151 --> 28:05.419
A blue balloon.

28:06.555 --> 28:07.656
Filled with blue air.

28:08.623 --> 28:09.658
I floated.

28:11.158 --> 28:12.426
The sun was blue.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.361
The sky was blue.

28:15.496 --> 28:17.398
Nobody could see me
in the blue sky.

28:18.199 --> 28:19.400
I was blue in the blue.

28:21.468 --> 28:23.337
- You were blue...
- I was blue.

28:23.370 --> 28:24.405
In the blue.

28:25.172 --> 28:26.608
Yes, the blue.

28:29.210 --> 28:30.377
Your dad has a blue car.

28:31.011 --> 28:32.046
- Dad?
- Mm-hm.

28:33.013 --> 28:34.048
Where is he?

28:35.684 --> 28:36.717
I don't know.

28:37.484 --> 28:38.520
Is he coming back?

28:39.353 --> 28:40.387
Yeah.

28:41.355 --> 28:42.624
Of course he is.

28:42.657 --> 28:43.692
When?

28:46.427 --> 28:47.461
I don't know.

29:17.124 --> 29:18.492
I learned how to dance.

29:19.793 --> 29:21.428
- Did you?
- I did.

29:24.098 --> 29:25.833
- I think you're lying.
- I'm not.

29:26.601 --> 29:27.968
What did I tell you about lying?

29:29.604 --> 29:30.639
I forgot.

29:35.376 --> 29:36.410
Come sit.

29:48.455 --> 29:49.758
You want me to tell you a story?

29:49.790 --> 29:50.824
- Yes.
- Okay

29:52.426 --> 29:53.460
Charlie and the Spider?

29:54.428 --> 29:56.430
No. The one about the hole.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.368
John and the Hole?

30:01.402 --> 30:02.436
Yes.

30:56.725 --> 30:57.759
Dad!

30:58.859 --> 31:00.695
Dad, where are we?

31:01.362 --> 31:02.396
Mom?

31:04.898 --> 31:05.933
Mom?

31:06.867 --> 31:07.901
Mom!

31:08.503 --> 31:09.804
Hey, Mom!

31:09.838 --> 31:12.339
- Mom, wake up! Please!
- What time is it, baby?

31:15.543 --> 31:17.077
Mom. Mom!

31:19.647 --> 31:20.715
Help, help...

31:20.749 --> 31:22.216
Mom, wake up!

31:22.249 --> 31:23.283
Dad, what...

31:28.188 --> 31:29.524
Mom! Mom!

31:31.726 --> 31:34.395
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

31:34.428 --> 31:36.463
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know.

31:37.030 --> 31:38.308
I don't know,
but Mom's not waking up!

31:38.332 --> 31:39.366
Mom!

31:42.035 --> 31:43.203
Baby?

31:48.409 --> 31:49.443
Is there a window open?

31:50.010 --> 31:51.378
Are you okay?

31:55.416 --> 31:56.450
Yes.

32:01.321 --> 32:02.757
What's going on?

32:02.791 --> 32:03.825
I don't know.

32:09.731 --> 32:10.765
Where's John?

32:37.458 --> 32:39.460
Hello! We're down here!

32:39.493 --> 32:40.528
- Help!
- Help!

32:41.061 --> 32:43.297
Anybody up there? Hello!

32:43.330 --> 32:44.599
Help!

32:45.800 --> 32:46.967
Hello, somebody!

32:48.503 --> 32:49.637
Hello!

32:52.674 --> 32:54.041
Hello, this is Bradley Shay.

32:55.643 --> 32:56.977
Hello, this is Bradley Shay.

32:59.179 --> 33:00.481
Hello, this is Bradley Shay.

33:02.917 --> 33:04.853
<i>Hi, this is Anna.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

33:09.189 --> 33:10.290
Hi, this is Anna.

33:11.659 --> 33:12.861
Hi, this is Anna.

33:14.261 --> 33:15.329
Hi, this is Anna.

33:31.144 --> 33:32.179
Charles?

33:33.313 --> 33:34.381
Hi, Anna Shay.

33:36.951 --> 33:37.986
Yes, hello.

33:39.854 --> 33:41.455
No, I'm calling to let you know

33:41.488 --> 33:43.423
that we don't need you
to come anymore.

33:44.893 --> 33:46.360
My husband has
some health issues.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.195
His heart.

33:49.029 --> 33:50.197
No, nothing serious.

33:51.365 --> 33:52.399
But...

33:52.967 --> 33:54.367
He's going to stay home
for a while.

33:55.235 --> 33:56.955
He wants to take care of
the garden himself.

33:57.805 --> 33:58.840
His doctor recommended...

34:00.073 --> 34:01.174
Charles, I understand.

34:02.510 --> 34:03.545
No, I'm...

34:04.579 --> 34:05.947
We don't need you
to come anymore.

34:07.015 --> 34:08.048
No, Charles.

34:09.316 --> 34:10.350
I'm sorry.

34:11.084 --> 34:12.119
I said I'm sorry.

37:31.251 --> 37:32.285
Paula?

37:34.622 --> 37:36.090
Up here.

37:36.124 --> 37:37.491
Hey, John.

37:38.559 --> 37:39.927
Can you tell
your mother I'm here?

37:39.961 --> 37:41.428
No.

37:41.461 --> 37:42.773
We're gonna be late.
The rehearsal starts...

37:42.797 --> 37:44.065
She's not here.

37:44.966 --> 37:46.000
She left.

37:46.968 --> 37:48.903
- What?
- She left.

37:50.638 --> 37:52.238
- That's not possible...
- They all left.

37:53.074 --> 37:54.374
Mom, Dad and Laurie.

37:54.407 --> 37:55.977
They went to go visit Grandpa.

37:57.377 --> 37:58.411
He's in the hospital.

37:59.580 --> 38:00.615
Oh...

38:01.414 --> 38:02.717
But...

38:02.750 --> 38:04.590
- Anna never called me.
- They left in a hurry.

38:07.922 --> 38:09.356
Well, in that case...

38:10.625 --> 38:12.960
Yes, I hope your grandfather
gets better...

38:12.994 --> 38:14.028
He had a heart attack.

38:15.563 --> 38:16.964
Mom told me he's in a coma.

38:18.065 --> 38:19.801
Induced coma. They have to wait.

38:21.803 --> 38:22.870
So sad.

38:22.904 --> 38:24.872
Yes. Sad.

38:25.973 --> 38:27.307
Do you know when she'll be back?

38:27.340 --> 38:29.544
No. No one knows.

38:31.179 --> 38:33.480
I stayed because I'm training
for the state qualies.

38:35.348 --> 38:36.383
Okay.

38:37.518 --> 38:39.754
If you talk to your mother,
please tell her to call me.

38:39.787 --> 38:41.222
I will.

38:41.255 --> 38:42.290
- Will you?
- I will.

38:42.824 --> 38:43.858
Thank you, John.

38:44.659 --> 38:45.939
Let me know
if you need anything.

38:46.426 --> 38:47.460
I will.

38:51.966 --> 38:53.234
Good luck with the qualies.

39:37.345 --> 39:38.378
John!

39:39.146 --> 39:41.048
Oh, son, thank God you're okay.

39:41.082 --> 39:42.516
Are you hurt?

39:42.550 --> 39:43.584
Is the house okay?

39:47.188 --> 39:48.222
What happened, John?

39:52.159 --> 39:54.128
- Do you know who did this?
- Did you see anyone?

39:57.932 --> 40:00.132
You wanna help us, buddy.
What do you got there, a rope?

40:05.172 --> 40:06.641
Go and get the ladder,

40:06.674 --> 40:08.051
the one I use
to fix the roof tiles.

40:08.075 --> 40:09.210
Remember the ladder?

40:09.243 --> 40:10.378
Go and get it.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.747
I'll help your mother
and your sister.

40:14.414 --> 40:15.583
What are you doing?

40:16.384 --> 40:17.618
No!

40:18.853 --> 40:20.429
I don't know what you think
you're doing, buddy...

40:20.453 --> 40:21.856
- Baby, please!
- John!

40:21.889 --> 40:24.091
- John.
- Please call 911,

40:24.125 --> 40:25.860
or call Paula and...

40:25.893 --> 40:29.063
Run right now to
the house and bring the ladder!

40:29.096 --> 40:30.765
You hear me? Right now?

40:32.233 --> 40:34.335
Stop looking at me like that!

40:34.368 --> 40:35.403
He did it.

40:36.370 --> 40:38.105
- What?
- He did it.

40:39.073 --> 40:40.574
Don't say that!

40:41.642 --> 40:43.110
He's not going to help us.

40:43.144 --> 40:44.779
Shut up, Laurie!

40:46.047 --> 40:47.081
Why'd you do it?

40:48.416 --> 40:50.084
You're in so much trouble,
little man.

40:50.651 --> 40:51.986
So much trouble!

40:53.387 --> 40:55.556
Go bring
the fucking ladder, John!

40:55.589 --> 40:56.590
Brad, please!

40:57.457 --> 40:58.693
No!

40:59.961 --> 41:01.028
Where're you going?

41:02.096 --> 41:03.130
John!

41:21.849 --> 41:23.684
<i>Luckiest asshole ever.</i>

41:24.285 --> 41:26.486
I don't think your guy
wants to play any more.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.955
<i>When are they coming back?</i>

41:27.989 --> 41:29.724
They don't know.

41:29.757 --> 41:32.827
<i>Luckiest motherfucking
asshole ever.</i>

41:36.597 --> 41:37.765
Wanna come for a few days?

41:37.798 --> 41:39.834
<i>Fuck! Third time
the net helped you!</i>

41:39.867 --> 41:41.278
<i>You need help from
the net to beat me.</i>

41:41.302 --> 41:43.637
<i>I'm playing against
you and the net.</i>

41:45.339 --> 41:46.640
What do you say?

41:46.674 --> 41:48.109
You can stay in my room.

41:48.142 --> 41:50.544
<i>Oh, the loser's room.
Sounds great.</i>

41:52.480 --> 41:53.514
<i>Fuck you.</i>

41:56.384 --> 41:58.285
So, what do you say?

41:58.319 --> 41:59.520
<i>Ah, maybe the weekend.</i>

41:59.553 --> 42:00.721
Weekend sounds good.

42:01.389 --> 42:03.024
I can pick you up
at the station.

42:03.057 --> 42:04.592
I'm driving Dad's car.

42:04.625 --> 42:05.760
- <i>You're driving?</i>
- Yeah.

42:06.994 --> 42:08.496
- <i>Then I'm staying.</i>
- Fuck you.

42:08.529 --> 42:09.563
<i>Fuck you!</i>

42:10.197 --> 42:11.832
Come on Laurie,
just give me all you got.

42:11.866 --> 42:12.967
- Come on.
- Dad.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.035
Oh!

42:14.568 --> 42:16.370
- I can't.
- You have to jump.

42:16.404 --> 42:18.372
- Just a little jump.
- I'm done.

42:18.406 --> 42:19.446
Why don't we take a break?

42:19.473 --> 42:20.509
Come on, Laurie!

42:20.541 --> 42:22.410
No, I'm coming down.

42:23.144 --> 42:24.678
No, come on, don't.

42:24.712 --> 42:25.746
Ahh!

42:29.150 --> 42:30.217
Goddamnit!

42:34.021 --> 42:35.056
Let me down.

42:36.390 --> 42:37.458
- Fuck!
- Why did he do it?

42:38.592 --> 42:41.362
I don't understand
why he did this.

42:42.430 --> 42:43.464
Laurie.

42:44.365 --> 42:45.699
Hey, hey, look at me.

42:47.835 --> 42:48.969
I know you can do this.

42:49.538 --> 42:50.571
Trust me.

42:51.372 --> 42:52.807
I wasn't even close, Dad.

42:52.840 --> 42:53.974
Just one more time.

42:57.878 --> 42:59.713
Hey. Don't touch that.
What are you doing?

42:59.747 --> 43:02.049
- Why?
- Don't do that. Don't!

43:02.083 --> 43:03.250
- What?
- Don't!

43:03.284 --> 43:04.418
We are not...

43:07.588 --> 43:08.989
We are not eating here.

43:09.023 --> 43:10.424
I'm starving, Dad!

43:10.458 --> 43:11.892
Well, we can't stay.

43:12.860 --> 43:13.961
We're not staying.

43:14.529 --> 43:15.830
There's no way out.

43:16.964 --> 43:18.432
We can't stay here.

43:18.466 --> 43:19.500
Give me the bag.

46:52.514 --> 46:53.814
What's going on, John?

46:56.584 --> 46:57.619
Hey!

46:59.987 --> 47:01.155
Talk to us.

47:06.093 --> 47:08.162
Is someone making you do this?

47:10.297 --> 47:11.800
Are they hurting you?

47:17.706 --> 47:18.807
It's so cold down here.

47:22.677 --> 47:23.712
Oh!

48:00.981 --> 48:02.249
Why don't you talk to us?

48:04.853 --> 48:05.886
Please.

48:09.858 --> 48:11.091
- At least...
- No.

48:52.065 --> 48:53.100
I think I'm scared.

48:55.068 --> 48:58.172
- Of what?
- You... driving.

49:01.275 --> 49:02.309
Dude, slow down.

49:03.310 --> 49:04.344
Slow the fuck down!

49:09.651 --> 49:10.685
What is this bullshit?

49:11.952 --> 49:13.020
No idea.

49:13.053 --> 49:14.955
- Turn it off.
- No.

49:20.994 --> 49:22.897
- How's your grandpa?
- Same.

49:22.931 --> 49:24.833
My mom wants your mom
to call again.

49:25.834 --> 49:27.434
Something about eating broccoli.

49:27.468 --> 49:28.502
Okay.

49:36.243 --> 49:37.879
Have you ever tried
to drown yourself?

49:46.353 --> 49:47.387
So?

49:48.656 --> 49:49.824
I was almost there.

49:49.858 --> 49:51.492
- Did you see anything?
- No.

49:51.526 --> 49:52.594
- Nothing?
- No!

49:52.627 --> 49:54.328
- My turn.
- Okay.

49:55.663 --> 49:56.698
Okay?

49:57.464 --> 49:58.499
Just give me a second.

49:59.500 --> 50:02.135
Remember, I start thrashing,
hold me a little bit longer.

50:02.169 --> 50:03.203
- Okay.
- Okay?

50:04.004 --> 50:05.339
Wait.

50:05.372 --> 50:06.841
What's a little bit longer?

50:06.875 --> 50:07.909
I don't know.

50:08.610 --> 50:09.744
I don't want to know.

50:09.777 --> 50:10.821
If I knew,
this wouldn't make sense.

50:10.845 --> 50:11.913
- Okay.
- You ready?

50:11.946 --> 50:12.981
Yeah.

51:25.720 --> 51:26.754
Breathe. Breathe.

51:27.755 --> 51:29.524
- What the fuck, man!
- So?

51:29.557 --> 51:30.625
So what?

51:30.658 --> 51:32.159
- Did you see anything?
- No.

51:32.192 --> 51:33.928
- Nothing?
- No.

51:33.962 --> 51:35.029
Nothing at all?

51:35.063 --> 51:36.330
- No!
- Fuck!

51:36.363 --> 51:38.198
Okay. What are we
supposed to see?

51:38.231 --> 51:39.266
I don't know.

51:39.299 --> 51:41.069
- You don't know?
- No.

51:41.101 --> 51:42.937
- You ever seen anything?
- No!

51:42.971 --> 51:44.891
- Okay, then, who told you...
- My friend, Ethan.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.674
In Boston.

51:47.875 --> 51:50.277
Not my friend really.
He saw the Virgin Mary.

51:50.310 --> 51:53.748
- The Virgin Mary?
- Yeah, Jesus' mom.

51:53.781 --> 51:56.050
- Wearing a swimsuit.
- Go fuck yourself.

51:56.084 --> 51:57.117
It's true.

51:59.286 --> 52:00.688
I want to go again.

52:10.765 --> 52:12.466
I told you, doubles suck.

52:12.499 --> 52:14.339
They suck 'cause you
don't know how to play it.

52:14.902 --> 52:16.269
You want to hit every ball.

52:16.303 --> 52:17.337
No, I don't.

52:19.507 --> 52:20.541
There. That's my side.

52:21.441 --> 52:22.761
I'm the left
and you're the right.

52:23.343 --> 52:24.823
Ones that come to the middle
are mine.

52:25.245 --> 52:26.480
That's where my forehand is.

52:26.514 --> 52:28.315
I'm Roger fucking Federer!

52:28.348 --> 52:30.118
My backhand is better
than my forehand.

52:40.028 --> 52:41.129
<i>Game!</i>

52:41.161 --> 52:42.195
I hate you.

52:44.599 --> 52:45.633
I hate you.

52:49.604 --> 52:50.638
Don't look.

53:59.941 --> 54:01.876
Oliver has to call the police.

54:04.779 --> 54:06.714
Paula must be going insane.

54:08.182 --> 54:10.250
I was supposed to help her
with catering.

54:11.219 --> 54:12.553
And center pieces.

54:15.455 --> 54:17.225
She begged me to help her.

54:25.265 --> 54:26.333
I miss Josh.

54:29.103 --> 54:30.138
You barely knew him.

54:40.715 --> 54:42.917
Last month,
John asked me something.

54:44.417 --> 54:45.485
It was a weird question.

54:46.386 --> 54:49.123
And I think I...

54:51.058 --> 54:52.527
What did he ask you?

54:56.831 --> 55:01.434
He wanted to know
what it's like to be an adult.

55:02.502 --> 55:04.371
He asked me what it feels like.

55:06.240 --> 55:08.276
When do you stop being a kid?

55:10.310 --> 55:11.344
It was...

55:12.312 --> 55:13.881
you know,
one of those weird questions

55:13.915 --> 55:15.683
he comes up with
every once in a while.

55:16.316 --> 55:17.350
Like when he asked me...

55:18.085 --> 55:21.622
why does the water in the pool
not feel like real water?

55:24.759 --> 55:26.326
Why people are allergic to nuts

55:27.494 --> 55:29.030
when nuts are a natural thing.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.801
I didn't know what to tell him.

55:35.269 --> 55:37.238
I have no idea
what it feels like

55:37.271 --> 55:38.306
to be an adult.

55:41.642 --> 55:43.711
I said something about...

55:45.046 --> 55:46.547
responsibilities.

55:47.281 --> 55:49.016
I told him
you never stop being a kid.

55:50.051 --> 55:51.252
That you get older...

55:53.120 --> 55:54.421
And grow up, but...

55:55.823 --> 55:57.158
You're still a kid inside.

55:58.893 --> 56:00.427
A kid with
more responsibilities.

56:04.866 --> 56:06.399
I don't think he liked that.

56:07.802 --> 56:09.036
I think he was...

56:11.172 --> 56:13.040
you know, disappointed.

56:27.555 --> 56:29.557
- What are you doing?
- What?

56:30.691 --> 56:32.126
What did you just do?

56:32.159 --> 56:33.194
What?

56:34.228 --> 56:36.130
Don't lick the spoon
and put it back in the jar.

56:36.163 --> 56:37.397
- Why not?
- It's disgusting.

56:37.430 --> 56:39.533
- You're disgusting.
- Your mom's disgusting.

56:39.567 --> 56:40.927
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.

56:47.608 --> 56:48.910
- What the fuck.
- What?

56:50.011 --> 56:52.246
Licking the spoon
is not the same as spitting.

56:52.280 --> 56:53.648
Yeah, it is.

56:53.681 --> 56:55.216
- It's not.
- Yeah, it is.

56:55.249 --> 56:56.449
It's not!

57:01.122 --> 57:02.390
You're so dead.

57:07.929 --> 57:09.263
Son of a bitch!

57:14.135 --> 57:15.670
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

57:17.071 --> 57:18.438
- You sure?
- Yeah.

57:20.574 --> 57:22.014
What should we do
with the other one?

57:34.822 --> 57:35.856
Ohh!

59:36.377 --> 59:40.147
Leave us alone!

1:00:17.751 --> 1:00:18.786
Where we going?

1:00:28.896 --> 1:00:29.930
Why are we here?

1:00:34.101 --> 1:00:35.136
John?

1:00:40.007 --> 1:00:41.041
I'm gonna miss the bus.

1:00:46.914 --> 1:00:47.948
Hey!

1:00:48.682 --> 1:00:50.151
Hey.

1:01:10.471 --> 1:01:11.506
Hey.

1:01:16.343 --> 1:01:17.778
What's this?

1:01:17.811 --> 1:01:18.946
Money.

1:01:18.979 --> 1:01:20.157
I know it's money,
but what is it for?

1:01:20.181 --> 1:01:21.348
It's for you.

1:01:23.117 --> 1:01:24.519
- It's for me?
- Yeah.

1:01:26.287 --> 1:01:27.522
You can buy whatever you want.

1:01:28.455 --> 1:01:29.490
Whose money is this?

1:01:30.357 --> 1:01:31.792
Yours.

1:01:31.825 --> 1:01:33.494
- You have an ATM card?
- Yeah.

1:01:36.531 --> 1:01:38.032
This is crazy.

1:01:39.233 --> 1:01:40.267
What do you want to buy?

1:01:40.901 --> 1:01:42.036
Nothing.

1:01:43.204 --> 1:01:44.338
What?

1:01:44.371 --> 1:01:45.483
I don't want to buy anything.

1:01:45.507 --> 1:01:46.617
Of course you do.
What do you want?

1:01:46.641 --> 1:01:47.676
Nothing.

1:01:51.478 --> 1:01:53.380
- This is a lot of money.
- Yeah.

1:01:53.414 --> 1:01:54.549
Can I keep it?

1:01:54.583 --> 1:01:56.317
It's yours.

1:01:56.350 --> 1:01:57.785
Thanks.

1:01:57.818 --> 1:01:58.895
So you don't want
to buy anything?

1:01:58.919 --> 1:01:59.954
Nope.

1:02:46.568 --> 1:02:47.602
Oww!

1:03:09.123 --> 1:03:10.800
Is there anything you need?
Anything I can help you with?

1:03:10.824 --> 1:03:12.192
- No.
- Are you sure?

1:03:12.226 --> 1:03:13.628
Yes.

1:03:13.662 --> 1:03:15.929
I mean, they've been gone
for a while now.

1:03:15.963 --> 1:03:16.997
I'm fine.

1:03:20.901 --> 1:03:22.637
Is someone coming
to clean the house?

1:03:25.406 --> 1:03:26.473
Yes.

1:03:27.074 --> 1:03:28.108
When?

1:03:29.511 --> 1:03:30.679
Next Wednesday.

1:03:32.313 --> 1:03:33.347
At two.

1:03:38.653 --> 1:03:40.087
Okay then.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.155
Wait.

1:03:42.189 --> 1:03:43.257
Don't go.

1:03:43.290 --> 1:03:44.502
Is there anything
you need, John?

1:03:44.526 --> 1:03:45.794
Yes.

1:03:45.826 --> 1:03:47.961
- What?
- Stay.

1:03:47.995 --> 1:03:49.731
Stay a little while.

1:03:49.764 --> 1:03:51.332
I don't have much time.

1:03:51.365 --> 1:03:52.399
Just a little while.

1:03:53.601 --> 1:03:54.669
Okay.

1:03:54.703 --> 1:03:55.737
- What do you...
- Sit.

1:04:08.382 --> 1:04:09.684
I'm 13 years old.

1:04:10.552 --> 1:04:11.586
I know.

1:04:12.386 --> 1:04:13.420
How old are you?

1:04:14.121 --> 1:04:15.623
You don't ask that to a lady.

1:04:15.657 --> 1:04:17.991
- Why not?
- You just don't. It's rude.

1:04:18.526 --> 1:04:19.561
Okay.

1:04:22.396 --> 1:04:23.665
My mom is 50.

1:04:24.398 --> 1:04:25.999
I know.

1:04:26.033 --> 1:04:28.703
We had a big party
in this house.

1:04:29.336 --> 1:04:30.772
I was here. Don't you remember?

1:04:33.641 --> 1:04:34.908
Are you also 50?

1:04:36.745 --> 1:04:38.045
What's with you today?

1:04:38.078 --> 1:04:39.113
Nothing.

1:04:41.348 --> 1:04:42.617
Are you?

1:04:44.552 --> 1:04:45.587
Yes.

1:04:48.922 --> 1:04:49.957
How does it feel?

1:04:51.358 --> 1:04:52.527
- What?
- To be 50.

1:04:54.596 --> 1:04:56.397
Not that bad, I must say.

1:04:57.331 --> 1:04:59.175
At first I was terrified,
but now that it happened...

1:04:59.199 --> 1:05:00.239
Don't you want the banana?

1:05:01.603 --> 1:05:03.070
It's all right,
I already had lunch.

1:05:06.775 --> 1:05:08.175
I have to go.

1:05:08.208 --> 1:05:09.711
- Don't.
- John!

1:05:09.744 --> 1:05:11.311
Please tell me
if you need anything.

1:05:11.345 --> 1:05:12.379
I need something.

1:05:12.413 --> 1:05:14.014
- Okay. What?
- I need you to stay.

1:05:14.047 --> 1:05:15.215
Stay?

1:05:15.249 --> 1:05:16.283
Sleep here.

1:05:18.018 --> 1:05:19.052
We can watch a movie.

1:05:20.020 --> 1:05:21.300
We have butter-flavored popcorn.

1:05:22.256 --> 1:05:23.892
I can't stay here, John.

1:05:23.924 --> 1:05:26.093
I have a family, things to do.

1:05:29.531 --> 1:05:31.231
You know what?
Let me call your mother.

1:05:31.265 --> 1:05:33.434
- Don't - Yes, this is crazy.

1:05:34.067 --> 1:05:35.703
They can't just
leave you here like...

1:05:35.737 --> 1:05:36.838
Don't call her.

1:05:43.878 --> 1:05:44.913
John.

1:05:46.781 --> 1:05:47.916
She left her phone here.

1:05:55.122 --> 1:05:56.423
They left in a hurry.

1:06:21.982 --> 1:06:23.016
Hey.

1:06:24.084 --> 1:06:25.319
- What happened?
- What?

1:06:26.253 --> 1:06:28.121
- What happened?
- When?

1:06:28.155 --> 1:06:29.990
- Between you and John?
- What?

1:06:30.859 --> 1:06:32.627
- Are you...
- Tell me what happened.

1:06:32.660 --> 1:06:34.337
I don't know what you think
that you are...

1:06:34.361 --> 1:06:35.797
You can tell me, Anna.

1:06:36.296 --> 1:06:37.632
Turn that thing off.

1:06:37.665 --> 1:06:39.233
- Just tell me.
- Turn it off!

1:06:40.535 --> 1:06:42.169
- Hey, what's going on?
- Nothing.

1:06:42.871 --> 1:06:43.972
Go back to sleep.

1:06:46.941 --> 1:06:49.677
I need to know what happened
because something had to happen.

1:06:50.310 --> 1:06:51.378
I'm thirsty.

1:06:55.783 --> 1:06:56.818
Don't drink it all.

1:07:32.587 --> 1:07:34.889
Nothing... happened.

1:07:51.039 --> 1:07:52.607
- Lily.
- What?

1:07:53.273 --> 1:07:56.143
- I'm leaving.
- Where?

1:07:56.176 --> 1:07:58.078
It doesn't matter.
I'll be fine, I just...

1:07:59.179 --> 1:08:01.583
I want you to know that
you are on your own now.

1:08:02.884 --> 1:08:04.284
- On my own?
- Yes.

1:08:06.086 --> 1:08:08.488
I'm leaving
and I'm not coming back.

1:08:09.958 --> 1:08:13.995
There's money for you
in a shoe box under the bed.

1:08:14.529 --> 1:08:16.965
It should last you ten months,

1:08:17.532 --> 1:08:19.067
maybe a year,
if you don't misuse it.

1:08:19.867 --> 1:08:21.368
- Can I come with you?
- No.

1:08:21.401 --> 1:08:22.770
Why not?

1:08:22.804 --> 1:08:24.906
Because you're old enough
to be on your own now.

1:08:25.439 --> 1:08:26.608
I'm 12.

1:08:27.441 --> 1:08:29.911
- I thought you were 13.
- I'm 12.

1:08:30.612 --> 1:08:31.646
Well...

1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:35.617
You know Grandma
was 15 when she had me.

1:08:35.650 --> 1:08:38.185
- I never met Grandma.
- Here, eat that.

1:08:38.820 --> 1:08:40.096
You told me
we were having chicken.

1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:41.154
We're not having chicken.

1:08:41.789 --> 1:08:44.458
There's no time to cook
a chicken. I'm leaving soon.

1:08:44.491 --> 1:08:45.727
- Don't.
- I have to.

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:47.562
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1:08:47.595 --> 1:08:49.262
They're picking me up, Lily.

1:08:49.296 --> 1:08:50.531
Who's picking you up?

1:08:50.565 --> 1:08:51.725
That's none of your business.

1:08:52.132 --> 1:08:53.166
- Dad?
- No.

1:08:54.401 --> 1:08:56.236
- Stop it!
- Take me with you!

1:08:56.269 --> 1:08:57.972
There is no room in the car!

1:08:58.606 --> 1:08:59.874
I can ride in the trunk.

1:08:59.907 --> 1:09:01.417
I can hold my breath
for almost a minute.

1:09:01.441 --> 1:09:03.310
- Okay, promise me something.
- What?

1:09:04.144 --> 1:09:07.214
Promise me
you will not quit school.

1:09:07.247 --> 1:09:08.759
I can go to school
wherever you're going.

1:09:08.783 --> 1:09:10.018
- You promise me.
- No!

1:09:11.019 --> 1:09:12.328
You promise me or
I'm taking the money.

1:09:12.352 --> 1:09:15.422
- Take it, I don't need it.
- Yes, you do.

1:09:15.455 --> 1:09:17.125
- I have the house.
- What house?

1:09:17.157 --> 1:09:18.225
This house.

1:09:18.258 --> 1:09:19.827
You don't have this house, Lily.

1:09:19.861 --> 1:09:21.361
Yes I do,
and I'm going to sell it.

1:09:22.797 --> 1:09:24.532
We don't own the house, Lily.

1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:28.301
We pay rent every month and
the money that I've left you

1:09:28.335 --> 1:09:30.672
is enough so that you can
continue to pay rent

1:09:30.705 --> 1:09:32.406
every month for the next year,

1:09:32.439 --> 1:09:34.575
if you don't misuse it,
as I said.

1:09:34.609 --> 1:09:36.476
- I'm going to misuse it.
- Well...

1:09:37.679 --> 1:09:39.319
Do whatever you want,
it's your money now.

1:09:39.346 --> 1:09:41.115
- And where will I go?
- When?

1:09:41.149 --> 1:09:42.182
When the money's gone.

1:09:42.784 --> 1:09:43.818
That's not my problem.

1:09:45.620 --> 1:09:47.287
This is your life.

1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:48.923
You get to make
your own decisions now.

1:09:48.956 --> 1:09:50.490
I don't want to make
my own decisions.

1:09:50.525 --> 1:09:51.559
Well, you have to.

1:09:55.029 --> 1:09:56.064
Okay.

1:09:57.230 --> 1:09:59.199
Enough. That's enough.

1:10:00.034 --> 1:10:01.869
You are not gonna stop me
from going.

1:10:02.502 --> 1:10:04.005
I can work for you.

1:10:04.872 --> 1:10:06.708
- What?
- I can do whatever you want.

1:10:06.741 --> 1:10:07.875
I can be your assistant.

1:10:10.812 --> 1:10:11.892
You are no assistant, Lily.

1:10:13.147 --> 1:10:15.750
My daughter is
nobody's assistant.

1:10:26.527 --> 1:10:28.129
You're nobody's assistant, Lily.

1:12:22.143 --> 1:12:23.611
Come on, John.

1:12:25.146 --> 1:12:26.180
Focus.

1:12:29.517 --> 1:12:30.551
You got this.

1:12:33.287 --> 1:12:34.322
Let's go.

1:12:36.557 --> 1:12:37.592
You're not.

1:12:38.793 --> 1:12:39.827
- I am.
- You're not.

1:12:39.861 --> 1:12:40.895
I'm ready.

1:12:42.563 --> 1:12:43.598
How's your mother?

1:12:44.131 --> 1:12:45.533
Good.

1:12:45.566 --> 1:12:47.526
Still waiting on the checks.
You owe me two weeks.

1:12:48.236 --> 1:12:49.270
I can pay you.

1:12:50.838 --> 1:12:51.918
Are you following the diet?

1:12:52.540 --> 1:12:53.574
Yes.

1:12:54.474 --> 1:12:55.674
What'd you have for breakfast?

1:12:56.510 --> 1:12:57.778
Low fat yogurt with cereal.

1:12:59.881 --> 1:13:00.915
Everything okay at home?

1:13:01.749 --> 1:13:03.150
Yes.

1:13:03.184 --> 1:13:05.104
Let me know if you need
anything, I can help you.

1:13:05.586 --> 1:13:06.621
Okay.

1:13:09.489 --> 1:13:11.292
- You don't need to.
- I want to.

1:13:12.093 --> 1:13:13.127
- Okay.
- Okay?

1:13:14.562 --> 1:13:16.340
- You don't need to.
- I know I don't need to.

1:13:16.364 --> 1:13:17.665
Just let me know how.

1:13:17.698 --> 1:13:19.475
You know, it'd be a pity
for you to miss out...

1:13:19.499 --> 1:13:21.035
- I'm ready.
- Stop saying that.

1:13:22.370 --> 1:13:23.403
Okay.

1:13:25.172 --> 1:13:26.207
You're not ready, John.

1:13:27.541 --> 1:13:28.776
You need these last days.

1:13:29.343 --> 1:13:30.544
You need to keep training.

1:13:31.045 --> 1:13:32.079
You need me.

1:13:32.747 --> 1:13:35.383
These qualies... are tough.

1:13:36.050 --> 1:13:37.151
Very tough.

1:13:38.085 --> 1:13:40.588
There are very good
players out there.

1:13:40.621 --> 1:13:42.990
There are kids your age
who train every day,

1:13:43.024 --> 1:13:44.792
every hour, like professionals.

1:13:46.027 --> 1:13:47.261
You know what I'm saying?

1:13:49.797 --> 1:13:50.831
Do you?

1:13:51.532 --> 1:13:52.566
Yes.

1:13:53.267 --> 1:13:55.036
You know, I had my experience
with parents

1:13:55.069 --> 1:13:56.671
who don't support
their children,

1:13:56.704 --> 1:13:58.372
who don't believe
in their potential.

1:13:58.406 --> 1:14:01.309
And let me tell you,
I shouted at them more than once.

1:14:02.977 --> 1:14:04.145
This is your life, John.

1:14:05.212 --> 1:14:06.479
This is what you want to do.

1:14:07.214 --> 1:14:08.649
This could be who you are.

1:14:10.151 --> 1:14:11.185
I want to.

1:14:12.119 --> 1:14:13.154
You want to what?

1:14:15.589 --> 1:14:17.457
I wanna be who I am.

1:14:21.494 --> 1:14:23.534
Are you gonna ask your mother
to send me the checks?

1:14:24.231 --> 1:14:25.266
Yes.

1:14:26.233 --> 1:14:27.268
Today?

1:14:30.805 --> 1:14:31.839
Great.

1:14:32.606 --> 1:14:34.418
Finish picking up your stuff
and get outta here.

1:14:34.442 --> 1:14:35.876
I need to use the court.

1:14:53.427 --> 1:14:54.494
Did you hear that?

1:14:55.830 --> 1:14:56.864
Yes.

1:14:59.333 --> 1:15:01.302
It's like I have a dog inside.

1:15:02.870 --> 1:15:04.638
A starving dog.

1:15:10.978 --> 1:15:12.813
He has to bring us
something today.

1:15:14.715 --> 1:15:16.784
When was the last time
he brought us anything?

1:15:16.817 --> 1:15:19.120
Two days. Almost two and a half.

1:15:22.823 --> 1:15:24.825
He's trying to kill us.

1:15:24.859 --> 1:15:27.862
He's gonna let us die here,
starve to death.

1:15:27.895 --> 1:15:29.330
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

1:15:30.998 --> 1:15:32.033
It's the truth.

1:15:37.371 --> 1:15:39.006
What if something
happened to him?

1:15:44.178 --> 1:15:45.546
What if he never comes back?

1:15:45.579 --> 1:15:48.015
- Shh!
- What?

1:15:48.682 --> 1:15:50.718
No, not you, the dog.

1:15:54.822 --> 1:15:56.223
I think it's the first time...

1:15:59.794 --> 1:16:00.874
The first time I've been...

1:16:01.495 --> 1:16:02.663
hungry.

1:16:02.696 --> 1:16:03.931
Like really...

1:16:05.433 --> 1:16:06.467
really hungry.

1:16:09.170 --> 1:16:10.237
It's about to become...

1:16:11.038 --> 1:16:12.073
a pain.

1:16:15.076 --> 1:16:16.377
A new kind of pain.

1:16:20.915 --> 1:16:22.983
I've never been hungry before.

1:16:27.221 --> 1:16:28.589
I'm always hungry.

1:16:42.036 --> 1:16:43.604
I hope nothing happened to him.

1:16:45.139 --> 1:16:46.807
He's trying to kill us, Mom.

1:17:56.477 --> 1:17:57.512
Fuck!

1:18:03.984 --> 1:18:05.019
I thought you...

1:18:07.354 --> 1:18:08.389
It's fine.

1:18:09.323 --> 1:18:10.758
It's just a game.

1:18:10.791 --> 1:18:12.426
- A game?
- Yeah.

1:18:12.459 --> 1:18:13.494
Okay.

1:18:15.863 --> 1:18:16.897
What are you doing here?

1:18:17.498 --> 1:18:21.235
I'm working next door.
I came to see your dad.

1:18:21.735 --> 1:18:22.770
See how he's doing.

1:18:23.672 --> 1:18:25.039
- My dad?
- Oh, my God.

1:18:26.207 --> 1:18:27.708
- Yes.
- He's not here.

1:18:30.679 --> 1:18:31.712
- Your mom?
- No.

1:18:33.648 --> 1:18:34.848
The garden looks like shit.

1:18:39.987 --> 1:18:41.288
Do you want something to drink?

1:18:43.190 --> 1:18:44.225
No.

1:18:45.726 --> 1:18:46.760
Thank you, no.

1:18:47.529 --> 1:18:49.863
I'll come...
I'll come back tomorrow.

1:18:50.565 --> 1:18:51.799
Tomorrow?

1:18:51.832 --> 1:18:52.866
Yeah, after work.

1:18:54.068 --> 1:18:55.102
Do we owe you money?

1:18:56.538 --> 1:18:58.072
- What?
- I have money.

1:19:00.074 --> 1:19:01.141
No.

1:19:01.775 --> 1:19:03.744
No money, John. No money.

1:19:05.614 --> 1:19:06.814
I just...

1:19:06.847 --> 1:19:07.915
Tell him I said hi.

1:19:08.916 --> 1:19:10.050
- I will.
- Okay.

1:19:13.921 --> 1:19:14.955
You're a good kid, John.

1:19:19.694 --> 1:19:21.061
Tonight I'm cooking risotto.

1:19:24.198 --> 1:19:25.232
Great.

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:27.434
Good for you.

1:19:30.404 --> 1:19:31.438
I'll see you later.

1:20:20.354 --> 1:20:23.290
If blue bugs bleed blue blood,

1:20:23.324 --> 1:20:26.994
and black bugs
bleed black blood,

1:20:27.027 --> 1:20:31.932
do blue black bugs bleed
blue black blood?

1:20:31.965 --> 1:20:35.102
If blue bugs bleed blue blood,

1:20:35.135 --> 1:20:38.038
and black bugs
bleed black blood...

1:20:58.359 --> 1:20:59.393
John.

1:21:00.494 --> 1:21:01.529
Hey.

1:21:02.530 --> 1:21:03.832
When are you gonna talk to us?

1:21:08.869 --> 1:21:10.705
Come on, John.
You made your point.

1:21:11.806 --> 1:21:13.107
We're not going to punish you.

1:21:13.874 --> 1:21:15.275
What is it you want, John?

1:21:16.644 --> 1:21:18.011
Help us.

1:21:18.045 --> 1:21:19.113
Let us help you.

1:21:24.051 --> 1:21:25.085
Please, John.

1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:26.855
We're so hungry.

1:21:27.722 --> 1:21:28.857
It stinks down here.

1:21:31.358 --> 1:21:33.595
This can't continue
much longer, John.

1:21:35.530 --> 1:21:38.365
Someone out there, somewhere...

1:21:38.399 --> 1:21:40.735
they're gonna get worried
and call the police.

1:22:11.365 --> 1:22:12.734
I tied it to a tree.

1:22:26.413 --> 1:22:27.481
I cooked risotto.

1:22:53.006 --> 1:22:54.041
You have forks.

1:23:15.530 --> 1:23:16.731
You haven't tried the wine.

1:23:22.336 --> 1:23:23.571
Your favorite.

1:23:31.513 --> 1:23:32.814
- Ahh.
- Mmm.

1:23:37.150 --> 1:23:38.452
I have mine.

1:23:47.194 --> 1:23:48.195
Mmm.

1:24:02.010 --> 1:24:03.578
Today I hit 300 serves.

1:27:38.559 --> 1:27:39.594
John.

1:27:49.637 --> 1:27:50.671
What time is it?

1:27:55.442 --> 1:27:56.476
I don't know.

1:27:58.746 --> 1:28:00.014
Don't you have tennis soon?

1:28:02.382 --> 1:28:03.416
Yeah.

1:28:08.122 --> 1:28:09.157
Thanks for the risotto.

1:28:11.424 --> 1:28:12.527
We really liked it.

1:28:22.069 --> 1:28:23.204
I'm sorry.

1:28:27.809 --> 1:28:28.843
For what?

1:28:32.980 --> 1:28:34.015
I don't know.

1:29:09.317 --> 1:29:12.086
What are you doing?

1:29:13.386 --> 1:29:15.388
What do you think I'm doing?

1:29:17.959 --> 1:29:20.427
- Don't do that.
- Why?

1:29:24.364 --> 1:29:26.767
- Laurie...
- I told you, she's asleep.

1:29:27.835 --> 1:29:31.606
- She can hear us.
- So let's be quiet.
