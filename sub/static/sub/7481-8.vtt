Yosemite Sam.

Is this blowback?

Hetty's source confirmed

04:41.013 --> 04:43.432
he retired from the Agency
three years ago.

04:43.434 --> 04:45.149
Since then,
he's made millions

04:45.151 --> 04:46.650
consulting hotshot
movie directors

04:46.652 --> 04:49.854
and video game companies about
his time with the Agency.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.689
Wait, so Black Bag was his game?

04:51.691 --> 04:53.157
That game is sweet.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.076
His espionage CV reads
like a Fodor's Guide

04:55.078 --> 04:56.444

04:56.446 --> 04:58.696
- What was his specialty?
- Precision explosives.

04:58.698 --> 05:01.482
Somebody's probably trying
to send a message.

05:01.483 --> 05:04.452
- You think?
- Let's check out Potter's place.

05:06.687 --> 05:11.008

why didn't <i>she</i> brief us?

05:30.717 --> 05:32.223
I always thought

05:32.225 --> 05:33.864

but really,

05:33.866 --> 05:35.572
that's patchouli,
'cause you, my friend,

05:35.574 --> 05:37.748

Okay.

05:37.750 --> 05:41.097
We've just begun
our investigation, Owen.

05:41.099 --> 05:44.329
I understand that,
but it's not necessary.

05:44.331 --> 05:47.757
Potter's murder
is troubling, I agree.

05:47.759 --> 05:49.779
I'll find that out

05:49.780 --> 05:53.855
momentarily,
as soon as he calls me back.

05:53.857 --> 05:55.545

05:57.419 --> 05:59.190

06:14.732 --> 06:16.916
Something's up.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.153
Something's
always up with Hetty.

06:20.530 --> 06:23.593
Come on,
let's go.

06:27.355 --> 06:29.177
I know that look.

06:29.179 --> 06:31.048
That's the "what's
Hetty not telling me

06:31.050 --> 06:32.457
that I'm dying
to know" look.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.073
Don't try to
figure it out.

06:34.075 --> 06:35.822
Many have tried
and failed.

06:35.824 --> 06:37.854
That's actually
not what I'm thinking.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.070
I just never realized

06:39.072 --> 06:41.354
that you were
a Yosemite Sam apologist.

06:41.356 --> 06:44.319
Yosemite Sam is
highly misunderstood.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.567
There's a lot of heart
behind that fiery temper.

06:46.569 --> 06:49.566
Well, I just had you pegged
as more of a Hanna-Barbera guy.

06:49.568 --> 06:52.515
Ah, Hanna. Barbera.

06:52.517 --> 06:53.948
Like I haven't
been hearing that

06:53.950 --> 06:55.231
every year since
third grade.

06:55.233 --> 06:56.813
Oh, you were
picked on as a kid?

06:56.815 --> 06:59.029
Not since I started
doing push-ups.

06:59.031 --> 07:00.945
What's your
favorite cartoon?

07:00.947 --> 07:02.894
Let me guess.

07:02.896 --> 07:04.167
<i>G-Force.</i>

07:04.169 --> 07:05.871
<i>Hong Kong Phooey.</i>

07:05.873 --> 07:07.607
He was a genius
at undercover work.

07:07.609 --> 07:09.642
Underdog beats him every time.

07:09.644 --> 07:11.411
He had a better
theme song.

07:11.413 --> 07:12.601
Plus he could fly.

07:12.603 --> 07:16.174
Underdog would kick
Hong Kong Phooey's ass.

07:18.656 --> 07:21.201
What a view, huh?

07:21.203 --> 07:23.203
Potter's got a life
like James Bond,

07:23.205 --> 07:26.461
got a pad like Scarface, and
now he's deader than disco.

07:26.463 --> 07:27.817
I guess it's true--

07:27.819 --> 07:30.347
you can't take
it with you.

07:31.341 --> 07:32.684
Ammonium nitrate, probably--

07:32.686 --> 07:35.658
maybe a smidgen of C-4.

07:35.660 --> 07:37.691
What'd you find?
Two champagne flutes,

07:37.693 --> 07:39.860
two different shades
of lipstick.

07:39.862 --> 07:42.734
He had company.
Computer's got a firewall.

07:42.736 --> 07:44.919
We're gonna need Eric
to crack it.

07:44.921 --> 07:47.389
I wonder what got him
more action, the view

07:47.391 --> 07:48.868
or these pictures?
"Nah, forget about

07:48.870 --> 07:50.868

08:11.659 --> 08:14.052

Her name is... Natalie.

08:14.054 --> 08:15.100
No, no. Nicole. Nicole.

08:15.102 --> 08:16.126
Her name is Nicole.

08:16.150 --> 08:17.491
How exactly
do you know her?

08:17.492 --> 08:19.108
Names come and go,
but you never forget

08:19.109 --> 08:20.937
- a pretty face like that.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure

08:20.939 --> 08:21.820
that wasn't her face
you were looking at.

08:21.843 --> 08:22.786

08:22.787 --> 08:24.647

- And what's that,

08:24.649 --> 08:26.416
a cruise line?
They may take you on a trip

08:26.417 --> 08:28.185

but no, Seven Star Oasis

08:28.187 --> 08:30.610

08:30.612 --> 08:33.976
That right there is one
<i>very</i> expensive call girl.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.549
Damn.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.583
Uh...

08:54.585 --> 08:55.600
strong firewall.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.009
So, what are we
talking, hours?

08:57.011 --> 08:59.091
For Langley, maybe.
For me, seconds.

08:59.093 --> 09:02.430
Potter's sign-in
is "Napoleon Solo."

09:02.432 --> 09:04.051
That the guy from
<i>Mission: Impossible?</i>

09:04.053 --> 09:06.056
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

09:06.058 --> 09:09.346
You know I like old TV shows.
Yeah, I know that.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.032
You also collect
vintage muscle cars

09:11.034 --> 09:12.636
and you listen
to vinyl records.

09:12.638 --> 09:14.273
Your point being?

09:14.275 --> 09:16.377
It's just an observation.

09:16.379 --> 09:18.548
What's he trying
to tell me?

09:18.550 --> 09:20.971
That you're a geek.
I am not a geek.

09:20.973 --> 09:24.144
You don't see me collecting
lunch boxes and action figures.

09:24.145 --> 09:25.981
Nothing wrong
with being a geek, Sam.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.303
I am <i>not</i> a geek.

09:28.305 --> 09:29.471
Okay.
You owe me

09:29.473 --> 09:33.164
a dollar, swear jar--
you said "damn."

09:33.166 --> 09:35.585
We have a swear jar? Since when?
How do you think

09:35.587 --> 09:37.505
Hetty affords all of her tea?

09:37.507 --> 09:38.875
She never said anything.
No.

09:38.877 --> 09:40.828
She just takes it
out of your paycheck.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.800
Damn.
Um...

09:42.802 --> 09:44.992
Where is Hetty,
by the way?

09:44.994 --> 09:47.662
I haven't seen her.

09:47.664 --> 09:49.918
You get any hits on the
women from Potter's tablet?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.566
I ran their faces

09:51.568 --> 09:54.961
as soon as you e-mailed the
video over from Potter's house.

09:54.963 --> 09:57.515
Nothing. They're probably
here illegally.

09:57.517 --> 10:01.305
Okay, focus, boys. So, why did Kensi

10:01.307 --> 10:02.954
and Deeks have
to break in?

10:02.956 --> 10:04.238
Wouldn't it be easier

10:04.240 --> 10:06.776
just to ask Seven Star
Oasis for a list

10:06.778 --> 10:08.886
of their clients
and employees?

10:08.888 --> 10:11.263
You never know who's
gonna be on the client list.

10:11.265 --> 10:12.493
Ballplayers, politicians...

10:12.495 --> 10:14.740
It would be like
Bill Belichick

10:14.742 --> 10:16.838
giving you his Super Bowl playbook.
But...

10:16.840 --> 10:18.266
you wouldn't need
Belichick's playbook.

10:18.268 --> 10:19.742
Not if you videotaped

10:19.744 --> 10:22.283
the team's walk-through
before the game.

10:23.842 --> 10:27.203
Eric gave me this DVD:
<i>46 Years</i>

10:27.205 --> 10:31.139
<i>of Football Highlights.</i>
I... finally watched it,

10:31.141 --> 10:33.025
and I'm kind
of obsessed.

10:33.027 --> 10:34.500
J-E-T-S!

10:34.502 --> 10:36.304
Jets! Jets! Jets!

10:37.373 --> 10:38.655
I'm a Pats fan,

10:38.657 --> 10:41.361
so I'm gonna pay you now,
before I curse.

10:41.363 --> 10:43.622
Thank you.
Patriots.

10:46.997 --> 10:48.333
So, you know this girl?

10:48.335 --> 10:49.583
Wha...? No.

10:49.585 --> 10:51.931
I never said that
I <i>know</i> her know her.

10:51.933 --> 10:53.472
I mean, not
biblically, at least.

10:53.475 --> 10:55.015
It was an undercover
vice operation

10:55.017 --> 10:57.635
back in the day, and I
was always a professional.

10:57.637 --> 10:59.211
And you played
the pathetic john?

10:59.213 --> 11:01.134
No, no, no.
I was a player.

11:01.136 --> 11:02.700
Yeah, Zegna suit, Rolex.

11:02.702 --> 11:05.219
Seven Star Oasis is all
about the high rollers.

11:05.221 --> 11:06.530
And they believed you?

11:06.532 --> 11:08.402
All you got to do is be
confident and look the part.

11:08.404 --> 11:09.542
Yeah? All right.

11:11.383 --> 11:13.627
What are you doing?

11:17.203 --> 11:19.433
I look the part?

11:19.435 --> 11:20.624
Absolutely.
You look the...

11:20.626 --> 11:21.849
You look the part.

11:21.851 --> 11:24.147
Is that supposed to be
a compliment or an insult?

11:24.149 --> 11:26.223
As a professional--
I mean a pro...

11:26.225 --> 11:28.265
Not-not a pro-pro. I just
meant like as-as an agent...

11:28.267 --> 11:29.645
I'm gonna stop talking.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.159
Listen, they're
gonna want to probably

11:31.162 --> 11:33.100
get a little frisky
in the back room,

11:33.102 --> 11:35.481
'cause they want to sample
the goods, so be careful.

11:35.483 --> 11:37.261
Yeah, I can handle any man
that gets fresh with me.

11:37.286 --> 11:38.324
Okay.

11:38.325 --> 11:39.480
You know that.
Yeah.

Aah!

Hayes record and broke it,

15:54.628 --> 15:56.090
and Monty had nothing
to do with it.

15:56.092 --> 15:57.519
You wouldn't do that.
Would you?

Hope I don't throw you
off your game.

15:59.485 --> 16:01.775
That is not cool.

And you were going to
tell me this when?

16:11.696 --> 16:14.436
What? So I like football.

16:14.438 --> 16:15.682
Big deal.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.958
Just something else
we have in common.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.835
So, the Giants...

16:19.837 --> 16:21.779

Lawrence Taylor.

16:30.470 --> 16:32.429
Giants lost that game

flash over substance.

Broadway lights

18:20.169 --> 18:22.337
Okay, the last NCIS employee

18:22.339 --> 18:24.922

Federal agents!

18:55.738 --> 18:57.455

Call Rescue.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.892
Got it.

19:44.344 --> 19:46.625
Two minutes later, she'd
be as dead as her friend.

19:46.626 --> 19:47.821
She owes you her life.

19:47.822 --> 19:49.646
What did you give her?
Naloxone.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.456
She'll have a headache
like a freight train, but...

19:51.458 --> 19:52.792
she'll be coherent.

19:53.896 --> 19:54.995
Thank you.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.100
This wasn't an accident,
was it, Nicole?

20:03.524 --> 20:05.695
Why don't you tell us
what you remember?

20:10.622 --> 20:12.508
I opened the door for him.

20:12.510 --> 20:13.720
Who?

20:13.722 --> 20:15.576
I don't know his name.

20:15.578 --> 20:19.511
He was supposed to pay us
as a... as a side deal.

20:19.513 --> 20:21.430
He said we could
make more money

20:21.432 --> 20:23.157
if we didn't involve our agency.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.635
That's the guy
he wanted us to meet.

20:28.637 --> 20:30.806
Victor... Potter.

20:32.124 --> 20:34.343
Ex-government big shot.

20:34.345 --> 20:35.610
Our client told us, though,

20:35.612 --> 20:37.798
that Potter couldn't know
we were pros.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.394
We were supposed to act like

20:39.396 --> 20:42.947
he was Denzel and Liam Neeson
rolled into one.

20:43.722 --> 20:45.151
I know, right?

20:45.153 --> 20:46.960
He wasn't even
that good-looking.

20:46.962 --> 20:48.705
But he was funny.

20:48.707 --> 20:50.464
He had a lot of, um,
spy stories,

20:50.466 --> 20:52.850
like, stories about presidents.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.856
Kissinger always said power
is the greatest aphrodisiac.

20:54.858 --> 20:56.047
He's wrong.

20:56.049 --> 20:58.155
Money is.

20:58.157 --> 21:01.827
You said you were paid
to seduce Potter?

21:01.829 --> 21:04.105
See, that's the thing.

21:04.107 --> 21:07.166
Um, our client didn't care
if we slept with Potter.

21:07.168 --> 21:11.127
All he cared about was some, um,
stupid prank with his lighter.

21:11.129 --> 21:13.253
It didn't make
any sense.

21:13.255 --> 21:14.579
I mean,
the lighters looked

21:14.581 --> 21:16.006
exactly the same.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.047
- Turned out to be a bad joke.
- You don't know

21:18.049 --> 21:20.360
his name, and you invited him
back to your house to pay you?

21:20.362 --> 21:23.625
No Seven Star Oasis?
No security?

21:23.627 --> 21:26.396
You look smarter
than that, Nicole.

21:29.067 --> 21:31.378
His name is Ruiz.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.044
That's all I know.

21:33.046 --> 21:35.798
He was popular with the girls.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.280
Not a cheapskate
like some of these other guys.

21:38.282 --> 21:40.339
He took girls shopping
on Rodeo Drive,

21:40.341 --> 21:41.954
that sort of stuff.

21:41.956 --> 21:43.348
Sounds like you liked this guy.

21:44.199 --> 21:45.866
Until he pulled a gun

21:45.868 --> 21:48.919
and shot us up with smack,
Ruiz was a real charmer.

21:50.088 --> 21:51.789
How's Inez?

21:54.009 --> 21:56.076
Inez didn't make it.

21:56.078 --> 21:58.762
I'm sorry.

22:02.269 --> 22:06.186
Nicole just I.D.'d Raul Ruiz as
both her client and assailant.

22:06.188 --> 22:08.355
He's got more bodies on him
than Freddy Krueger.

22:08.357 --> 22:10.524
There's an alphabet soup
of agencies who want him.

22:10.526 --> 22:12.192
He does wet work for
the highest bidder.

22:12.194 --> 22:14.979
Cartels, black bag
disavowed missions,

22:14.981 --> 22:16.930
stuff for anyone
who's got the cash.

22:16.932 --> 22:19.067
You think Ruiz was doing some
of Potter's dirty work?

22:19.069 --> 22:20.234
Maybe stiffed him for money?

22:21.954 --> 22:23.955
Whoop, hold on a second.

22:23.957 --> 22:24.955
Guys,

22:24.957 --> 22:27.174
I got a location on Ruiz.

22:28.243 --> 22:32.129
Okay, security cam picked him up
at a cafe in Montrose.

22:32.131 --> 22:34.749
Okay. You happen to know
where Hetty is, Nell?

22:34.751 --> 22:36.951
I'm sorry. I tried.

22:36.953 --> 22:39.803
She even took the chip
out of her cell phone.

22:39.805 --> 22:42.424
Henrietta's whereabouts are
of no one's concern but her own.

22:42.426 --> 22:44.476
You know where Hetty is?

22:44.478 --> 22:45.809
She can take care of herself.

22:45.811 --> 22:47.261
Henrietta's a big girl.

22:47.263 --> 22:50.814
Well, relatively speaking.

22:50.816 --> 22:52.099
So, where is she?

22:52.101 --> 22:53.517
You solved
Potter's murder

22:53.519 --> 22:55.635
and have a location
for his assassin.

22:55.637 --> 22:57.921
The CIA can take it from here.

22:57.923 --> 22:59.189
You asking us to stand down?

22:59.191 --> 23:01.182
Did I stutter?

23:01.184 --> 23:02.844
Book's closed.

23:02.846 --> 23:04.090
What if we use,

23:04.092 --> 23:06.167
like, a bookmark?

23:07.912 --> 23:09.738
Control your people, Mr. Callen.

23:15.521 --> 23:17.298
Let's roll.

23:47.619 --> 23:48.646
Hello?

23:48.648 --> 23:49.660
You've got company.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.139
What do you want me to do?

23:51.141 --> 23:52.434
Nothing. I'll take care of it.

23:52.436 --> 23:54.594
Stay right there.

23:55.592 --> 23:57.170
We'll take him
on my call.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.328
Get down! Get down!

24:21.477 --> 24:22.754
Deeks?
No shot.

24:28.619 --> 24:29.648
Eric,

24:29.650 --> 24:30.778
did you get that vehicle?

24:30.780 --> 24:31.564
Lincoln Navigator,

24:31.566 --> 24:33.788
no plates.

24:33.790 --> 24:36.329
Sorry, guys.
We lost them.

24:44.054 --> 24:45.609
Where's Granger?

24:45.611 --> 24:47.280
He left right
after you did.

24:47.282 --> 24:49.537
He say where he was going?
No.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.428
Anything from the traffic cams?

24:51.430 --> 24:53.416
Uh, couple of angles
of the shooting,

24:53.418 --> 24:55.690
but no clear view of the
driver or the passenger.

24:55.692 --> 24:57.229
Thanks, Eric.

24:57.231 --> 24:59.703
What's up?

24:59.705 --> 25:02.078
We defied a direct order,

25:02.080 --> 25:04.049
and we've got nothing
to show for it.

25:04.051 --> 25:05.672
It's not the first time.

25:05.674 --> 25:06.959
This is on Granger's watch.

25:06.961 --> 25:08.347
Suddenly you're worried
about Granger?

25:10.655 --> 25:13.998
Hetty insists we take a case,
and she disappears.

25:15.370 --> 25:17.342
And Granger's all over us,
and now he disappears?

25:17.344 --> 25:18.596
Yeah.

25:18.598 --> 25:20.519
Something's missing.

25:20.521 --> 25:22.358
And I think I know
where to find it.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.570
Nell.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.298
I got another job for you.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.722
No.

25:32.724 --> 25:34.344
I wouldn't do it
for Joe Namath's

25:34.346 --> 25:35.331
Super Bowl ring.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.969
If Hetty wants
to keep something private,

25:36.971 --> 25:38.975
it should stay that way.

25:38.977 --> 25:40.746
This is all we've got, Nell.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.405
Hetty could be in trouble--
we got to do this...

25:43.407 --> 25:44.927
I know you know the code.

25:45.847 --> 25:47.133
Come on, Nell.

25:47.135 --> 25:48.772
She put something
in that box.

25:48.774 --> 25:50.644
I know it's
important.

25:52.535 --> 25:55.124
All right. Okay.

26:02.933 --> 26:03.984
That wasn't so hard.

26:03.986 --> 26:05.323
It's easy for you to say.

26:05.325 --> 26:08.134
They don't get NFL Sunday
Ticket in Guantanamo Bay.

26:08.135 --> 26:09.836
Fireman Ed would
be proud of you.

26:16.223 --> 26:17.262
That's Potter,

26:17.264 --> 26:19.544
our dead guy,
with Hetty and Granger.

26:19.546 --> 26:21.673
This was taken someplace
Middle Eastern.

26:21.675 --> 26:24.176
Karachi?
Cairo?

26:24.178 --> 26:25.624
Yeah, but how long ago?

26:25.626 --> 26:27.158
At least a decade ago.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.861
I can't tell.
Potter's dead.

26:28.863 --> 26:30.939
Hetty and Granger
are off the grid.

26:31.407 --> 26:33.941
Maybe it all comes down
to this guy.

26:33.943 --> 26:36.021
This is where
Hetty's going.

26:36.023 --> 26:38.869
To find him.

26:53.438 --> 26:55.995
This is Barry Brooks,
another CIA vet

26:55.997 --> 26:58.507
with a long association
with our victim Victor Potter.

26:58.899 --> 27:00.361
How well does he know
Hetty and Granger?

27:00.362 --> 27:01.777
Well enough for them
all to have connected

27:01.778 --> 27:02.797
in Afghanistan
in the '80s.

27:02.799 --> 27:04.091
After that,
they became part

27:04.093 --> 27:05.279
of an informal
team for nearly

27:05.281 --> 27:06.695
15 years for the CIA,

27:06.697 --> 27:09.772
also the CIA/NCIS
joint task forces.

27:09.774 --> 27:11.782
Can you pinpoint the time
and location of this photo?

27:11.784 --> 27:13.382
- That's a negative.
- Any conflict

27:13.383 --> 27:14.524
between Brooks and Hetty?

27:14.525 --> 27:16.701
Based on e-mails from
Potter's hard drive,

27:16.703 --> 27:18.123
Brooks's main conflict

27:18.125 --> 27:19.561
was with Potter.

27:19.563 --> 27:21.292
Brooks accused Potter
of embellishing

27:21.294 --> 27:22.575
their old missions
for profit

27:22.577 --> 27:25.109
with his, uh, video game
and movie consulting.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.745
Do you think Brooks
would really be willing

27:26.747 --> 27:28.428
to kill his former partner
over that?

27:28.430 --> 27:29.663
Well, it can be frustrating
when your partner

27:29.665 --> 27:31.122
grandstands and likes
to take credit for everything.

27:31.124 --> 27:33.849
I mean, I can sympathize,
but killing for that

27:33.851 --> 27:35.532
might be a bit extreme.

27:35.534 --> 27:36.613
Yeah?

27:36.637 --> 27:37.643
So, what does any
of this have to do

27:37.644 --> 27:39.790
with the party girls, Ruiz
or the woman who killed him?

27:40.489 --> 27:43.133
Well, the girls were paid
to switch the lighters.

27:43.406 --> 27:44.847
Ruiz probably tried to kill them

27:44.849 --> 27:46.660
- to tie up some loose ends.
- Okay, well,

27:46.662 --> 27:48.080
if that's the case,
then who hired Ruiz?

27:48.082 --> 27:49.333
Well, it could
be the woman

27:49.335 --> 27:51.755
who went all Angelina Jolie
on him in Montrose.

27:51.757 --> 27:52.926
Maybe Brooks hired both of them.

27:52.928 --> 27:54.246
Makes sense.

27:54.248 --> 27:55.749
- He's the last man standing.
- When was

27:55.751 --> 27:56.853
the last time
either Brooks

27:56.855 --> 27:58.139
or Potter tried
to contact Hetty?

27:58.141 --> 27:59.943
How about yesterday?

27:59.945 --> 28:02.451
Brooks is preparing
a multi-million-dollar lawsuit

28:02.453 --> 28:04.122
against Potter for a share
of Potter's profits

28:04.124 --> 28:05.775
from the Black Bag
video game.

28:05.777 --> 28:07.212
Potter e-mailed Hetty
to ask for her advice.

28:07.214 --> 28:08.750
The last call

28:08.752 --> 28:12.175
Hetty made from her desk
was to Brooks's home phone line.

28:12.177 --> 28:13.395
Think she paid him a visit?

28:38.830 --> 28:40.082
Federal agents!

28:47.017 --> 28:48.255
Clear.

28:49.974 --> 28:51.539
Got a body.

28:51.541 --> 28:53.637
Clear.

28:53.639 --> 28:55.787
Clear.
Clear.

28:58.110 --> 28:59.707
It's Brooks.

28:59.709 --> 29:01.719
Looks like he
dragged himself.

29:02.976 --> 29:04.093
"Nogales Bo"?

29:04.095 --> 29:07.136
Nogales is a town in Arizona.

29:07.138 --> 29:08.545
It also means
"walnut trees"

29:08.547 --> 29:11.298
in Spanish, but I don't
know what "Bo" means.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.241
The old man took on a few
of them, but they beat him.

29:13.243 --> 29:15.219
Tortured him, maybe.

29:15.221 --> 29:19.140
They either left
his body here...

29:19.142 --> 29:20.339
Or he crawled over here
with his dying breath.

29:20.364 --> 29:21.861
To draw something

29:21.862 --> 29:23.806
in his own blood
that makes no sense?

29:23.808 --> 29:27.003
Yeah, Bo knows...
Bo knows nothing.

29:28.671 --> 29:32.576
Guys, got something here.

29:32.578 --> 29:33.944
Nobody move.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.922
It's a
trip wire.

29:44.644 --> 29:45.813
Careful, Sam.

29:47.627 --> 29:48.699
Eric?

29:48.700 --> 29:50.412
Yeah?
Call the bomb squad.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.572
On it.

29:54.551 --> 29:56.199
This was meant for Hetty.

29:59.168 --> 30:00.650
Thank you, Commander.
I'll pass it on.

30:00.652 --> 30:04.310
So, LAPD bomb squad
disabled the device.

30:04.312 --> 30:06.007
I guess that's something.

30:06.009 --> 30:07.408
Any word from the others?

30:07.410 --> 30:08.646
They're on their way back.

30:08.648 --> 30:09.882
Still no sign of Hetty.

30:09.884 --> 30:12.017
Maybe that's
a good thing.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.333
How do you figure that?

30:14.335 --> 30:15.342
The bomb didn't get her.

30:15.344 --> 30:16.319
Yeah, but maybe the person

30:16.321 --> 30:17.445
who set the bomb did.

30:17.447 --> 30:19.315
Hetty's too smart for that.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.244
Okay, then why
can't we find her?

30:22.246 --> 30:24.262
Why hasn't she tried
to contact us?

30:24.264 --> 30:26.216
Somebody is out there
trying to kill her.

30:26.218 --> 30:28.037
I know-- we've got
to stay cool.

30:28.039 --> 30:29.527
This is Hetty, right?

30:29.529 --> 30:31.876
She's always three steps
ahead of everyone.

30:31.878 --> 30:34.541
She's tactically brilliant,
ridiculously courageous,

30:34.543 --> 30:36.113
experienced, resourceful.

30:36.115 --> 30:39.110
I mean, if Mata Hari and
Genghis Khan had a daughter,

30:39.112 --> 30:40.359
it'd be Hetty.

30:41.892 --> 30:44.305
Or General Patton
and Joan of Arc.

30:44.307 --> 30:46.020
Exactly.

30:46.022 --> 30:48.385
Her kung fu is strong,
and her magic is powerful.

30:49.685 --> 30:51.964
Say it.

30:51.966 --> 30:54.013
Her kung fu is strong,

30:54.015 --> 30:56.126
and her magic is powerful.

30:57.492 --> 30:59.506
Don't underestimate Hetty.

30:59.508 --> 31:01.454
She never
underestimates us.

31:01.456 --> 31:03.318
Eric, downstairs.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.650
Guys are back.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.741
I'm thinking they dragged
Brooks' body into the bathroom,

31:14.743 --> 31:16.971
then rigged him with
a booby trap, left him for dead.

31:16.973 --> 31:18.355
Only he wasn't.

31:18.357 --> 31:20.269
Not quite.

31:20.271 --> 31:22.452
"Bo" we know now stood
for bomb, but "Nogales"?

31:22.454 --> 31:24.617
Could "Nogales" be
the name of the woman

31:24.619 --> 31:26.421
who killed Ruiz
at the cafe?

31:26.423 --> 31:27.373
Maybe.

31:27.375 --> 31:28.997
This whole thing
could be about her.

31:31.312 --> 31:34.461
She hires Ruiz to take out
Potter and Brooks,

31:34.463 --> 31:36.758
and then rigs the body
to take out Hetty

31:36.760 --> 31:38.121
when she comes
looking for him.

31:38.123 --> 31:40.154
So, Ruiz is at the cafe
waiting for her,

31:40.156 --> 31:41.598
probably to get paid.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.092
She spots us
and decides to kill him?

31:44.094 --> 31:46.061
Doesn't matter--
he's dead either way.

31:46.063 --> 31:48.744
If Hetty was in danger,
why would she leave here?

31:48.746 --> 31:50.238
Because, if
someone is

31:50.240 --> 31:51.683
after Hetty,
the last place on earth

31:51.685 --> 31:53.720
- she's gonna lead them is here.
- Knowing Hetty,

31:53.722 --> 31:55.367
she'd set a trap to see
who's coming after her.

31:55.369 --> 31:56.691
If she needs

31:56.693 --> 31:58.899
our help, why wouldn't
she make it easier for us?

31:58.901 --> 32:00.324
Because that's not

32:00.326 --> 32:01.870
Hetty.

32:01.872 --> 32:03.262
Doesn't mean she didn't
leave bread crumbs.

32:03.264 --> 32:07.338
We just got take a step back
and find them.

32:11.889 --> 32:13.705
What you thinking?

32:17.357 --> 32:21.058
<i>Nogal--</i> Spanish
for walnut tree.

32:22.332 --> 32:23.509
Nell?

32:25.638 --> 32:27.797
You remember that
get-well basket we sent Hetty?

32:27.799 --> 32:30.220
She sent it back
because of all the nuts.

32:30.222 --> 32:31.414
Yeah, I picked it out.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.379
Yeah, I chipped in for
that-- it wasn't cheap.

32:33.381 --> 32:35.293
Hetty's allergic to nuts.

32:35.295 --> 32:37.618
Okay, now, that's odd,
even for Hetty.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.941
Eric, check Hetty's
computer log.

32:40.943 --> 32:43.527
Hetty's last search
was on the CIA database

32:43.529 --> 32:45.001
for a Casa De Nogales.

32:45.002 --> 32:45.981
That's got to be it.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.967
It was used as
a presidential retreat

32:48.144 --> 32:50.155
for Gerald Ford,

32:50.157 --> 32:52.643
last used as a safe house
for NSA, NCIS,

32:52.645 --> 32:54.574
CIA, anyone
who needed it.

32:54.576 --> 32:58.174
Hetty's sending us a message--
she's taking a stand.

33:19.466 --> 33:21.573
Shh.

33:29.212 --> 33:30.832
Don't even think
about it.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.406
Gun.

33:32.407 --> 33:34.255
Let's go.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.724
This is the best
Langley can do?

33:40.726 --> 33:43.270
The boys are slipping.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.215
Hetty?

33:51.346 --> 33:52.643
You had orders, Agent Callen.

33:53.454 --> 33:54.702
Mr. Callen.

33:56.859 --> 33:57.782
Farmer, is that you?

33:57.784 --> 33:59.615
Sam Hanna.

33:59.617 --> 34:01.674
How's Michelle?

34:01.676 --> 34:04.383
She's good. She's good.

34:04.385 --> 34:06.944
Uh, guys, this is my old
DEVGRU commander, Dale Farmer.

34:06.946 --> 34:09.936
He's CIA now, special
operations group.

34:09.938 --> 34:12.846
- Taught me everything I know.
- Well, almost everything.

34:12.848 --> 34:15.121
I pinned that Trident to your
chest-- don't you forget that.

34:15.123 --> 34:16.386
If we wanted you here,

34:16.388 --> 34:17.915
we would have called.

34:18.748 --> 34:21.157
Was this your
doing, Henrietta?

34:21.159 --> 34:24.114
I didn't call them, Owen.

34:24.947 --> 34:27.772
This is not my idea
to be here.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.851
So, what's going on, Dale?

34:28.853 --> 34:30.431
Well, after Potter was killed

34:30.434 --> 34:33.373
and Brooks went silent,
we thought it'd be best to, uh,

34:33.376 --> 34:35.702
sequester the old team
until we could figure out

34:35.704 --> 34:37.164
who was coming after them.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.109
You don't know who's after you?

34:39.110 --> 34:41.768
We made a lot of enemies
over the years, Mr. Callen.

34:41.770 --> 34:43.181
Well, Brooks was
tortured to death.

34:43.183 --> 34:44.590
He wrote "Nogales"
in his own blood,

34:44.592 --> 34:45.833
and that's how we found you.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.954
Your operational security's
been blown, Hetty.

34:47.956 --> 34:49.179
We need to move you.

34:49.181 --> 34:51.302
I'll call it in.
No, you guys have done enough.

34:51.304 --> 34:52.512
It's my call to make.

34:52.514 --> 34:53.920
Aah!

34:57.850 --> 34:59.008
Farmer, you okay?

34:59.010 --> 35:01.047
Just a little scratch.

35:02.275 --> 35:04.279
At least two shooters.

35:04.281 --> 35:06.019
Make that four!

35:06.849 --> 35:08.966
Or five.

35:08.968 --> 35:10.350
Let's bang out
from both sides, double back

35:10.352 --> 35:12.019
- with the car for Farmer.
- Kensi, Deeks,

35:12.021 --> 35:13.470
take the front;
we'll take the back.

35:13.472 --> 35:14.554
Got it.

35:14.556 --> 35:16.639
You watch our backs,
stabilize Farmer.

35:16.641 --> 35:18.724
You stay here.

35:41.912 --> 35:43.413
Deeks!

36:18.079 --> 36:19.712
Reloading.

36:26.803 --> 36:28.119
Callen, Sam, black Navigator

36:28.121 --> 36:29.338
coming your way.

37:06.287 --> 37:07.704
Who are you?

37:09.589 --> 37:13.341
My name is Fatima Khan.

37:20.666 --> 37:23.350
I thought I told you
to stay back.

37:23.352 --> 37:25.970
We share a similar attitude

37:25.972 --> 37:28.522
towards obeying the rules,
Mr. Callen.

37:30.026 --> 37:31.776
You know her?

37:40.457 --> 37:42.741
I do now.

37:57.561 --> 37:59.596
Fatima Khan

37:59.598 --> 38:02.767
was born in Karachi
to a mother who sewed dresses

38:02.769 --> 38:05.103
and a father
who was a cab driver.

38:05.105 --> 38:07.323
When she was 12 years old,
her father began

38:07.325 --> 38:10.193
driving a cab
for this man.

38:10.195 --> 38:11.496
Him I know.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.498
Noreen Haseeb,
former Mujahedeen soldier,

38:13.500 --> 38:14.665
and founding member
of al-Qaeda.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.001
He was one of the architects

38:16.003 --> 38:18.787
of the Nairobi Embassy bombings.

38:18.789 --> 38:20.874
One day, Noreen Haseeb had a
meeting with a terrorist cell.

38:20.876 --> 38:23.928
Fatima's father was driving
Haseeb to the meeting

38:23.930 --> 38:26.882
when the cab exploded--
it wasn't an accident.

38:26.884 --> 38:29.184
Zoom in on that guy
in the back.

38:31.388 --> 38:32.926
It's Victor Potter.

38:32.928 --> 38:34.466
CIA records confirm
Potter's team

38:34.468 --> 38:36.330
was responsible
for the bombing.

38:36.332 --> 38:38.646
I found one other photo.

38:39.815 --> 38:41.433
You think that little girl

38:41.435 --> 38:42.568
is Fatima Khan?

38:42.570 --> 38:44.512
I think so.

38:44.514 --> 38:46.164
Her father died in the blast.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.125
Fatima eventually earned her

38:48.127 --> 38:50.069
computer engineering degree
from Caltech,

38:50.071 --> 38:51.365
founded her own
telecommunications firm

38:51.367 --> 38:53.473
in Pakista-
made millions.

38:53.475 --> 38:55.692
Her company created
an eavesdropping device

38:55.694 --> 38:58.657
that was contracted by
the Pakistan's ISI.

38:58.659 --> 38:59.905
Eventually,
she joined the Agency,

38:59.907 --> 39:03.275
becoming a point person
on joint ISI/CIA missions.

39:03.277 --> 39:06.628
Her clearance would have given
her access to classified files.

39:06.630 --> 39:08.138
She had her own agenda.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.481
That's how she found out
about Victor Potter

39:09.483 --> 39:11.609
and the rest of his team.

39:11.611 --> 39:13.757
And her deep pockets paid
for Ruiz and anybody else

39:13.758 --> 39:15.852
who would help her
get her revenge.

39:15.854 --> 39:19.257
She wasn't born a killer.

39:19.259 --> 39:21.890
We made her one.

39:23.685 --> 39:25.463
I told you,
I'm better when I move

39:25.465 --> 39:26.803
and they're shooting at me.

39:26.806 --> 39:28.264
Still owe me
Crustacean.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.427
And you owe me
an Isaac Hayes record.

39:30.429 --> 39:31.634
Actually...

39:31.636 --> 39:33.848
I don't.

39:33.850 --> 39:35.391
Bam.

39:36.935 --> 39:38.746
Where'd you find these?

39:38.748 --> 39:40.675
Casa De Nogales had a
whole stack of records.

39:40.677 --> 39:42.195
Those were sandwiched
between <i>Hotel California</i>

39:42.197 --> 39:43.236
and <i>Zeppelin Four.</i>

39:43.238 --> 39:44.859
You ready?

39:44.861 --> 39:47.795
Oh, uh, you want to come
have drinks with us?

39:47.797 --> 39:49.672
Come on, man.

39:49.675 --> 39:51.244
Hang out with us.

39:51.246 --> 39:52.832
I have Eric and Nell
coming over to my place.

39:52.835 --> 39:55.052
Gonna watch a James Bond
marathon on Blu-ray.

39:55.054 --> 39:56.588
I got the box set.

39:56.590 --> 39:58.177
Seriously?
Yeah.

39:58.178 --> 40:01.113
Well...
So, you're a geek?

40:01.115 --> 40:02.821
I am not a geek.

40:02.823 --> 40:05.143
Then you're
a fan boy?

40:07.091 --> 40:09.223
I'm a complicated man.

40:09.225 --> 40:10.898
Can I come?

40:16.994 --> 40:18.611
Mr. Callen.

40:20.510 --> 40:23.515
I'm allergic to nuts.

40:38.667 --> 40:41.836
Is that
the good stuff?

40:41.838 --> 40:43.933
It's 50 years old.

40:43.935 --> 40:45.964
It bloody well
better be good.

41:01.733 --> 41:03.928
So, would you do it again?

41:03.930 --> 41:06.107
Without hesitation, Owen.

41:07.049 --> 41:10.944
Two lives saved
hundreds of others.

41:19.151 --> 41:21.594
Well, Potter planted the bomb,

41:21.596 --> 41:23.906
but it was your finger
on the detonator.

41:30.179 --> 41:32.243
Not everyone
can do what we do.

41:35.496 --> 41:38.385
The secrets we live with,

41:38.387 --> 41:41.720
the personal sacrifices we make.

41:41.722 --> 41:44.495
I just pray the world's
a better place for them.

41:45.981 --> 41:48.704
I didn't choose
this life, Owen.

41:49.547 --> 41:52.624
It chose me.

41:52.626 --> 41:56.795
All you can do is keep
your head down, your gun up

41:56.797 --> 41:59.959
and your conscience clear.

42:06.271 --> 42:08.564
The night is young.

42:13.589 --> 42:15.588
Let's get faded.

42:15.590 --> 42:20.800
