<i>[Jane] </i>Old Flo was one
of my very favorite chimpanzees.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.649
<i>She had this wonderful way</i>
<i>of playing with her offspring.</i>

40:03.109 --> 40:04.777
<i>She would lie on her back,</i>

40:04.860 --> 40:06.320
<i>take the wrist of the infant,</i>

40:07.780 --> 40:11.700
<i>dangle it above her, and then</i>
<i>tickle until the little infant did…</i>

40:11.784 --> 40:14.912
<i>[panting noisily]</i>
<i>…which is how they laugh.</i>

40:17.415 --> 40:23.254
<i>And her youngest son, Flint,</i>
<i>was overly dependent on his mother,</i>

40:23.337 --> 40:27.258
<i>riding on her back until she was so weak</i>
<i>she couldn't hold him.</i>

40:29.260 --> 40:33.973
<i>Old Flo died very peacefully,</i>
<i>just crossing a stream.</i>

40:34.890 --> 40:39.728
<i>And Flint, he sat on the riverbank,</i>
<i>and he looked down at her,</i>

40:39.812 --> 40:44.316
<i>and he took her dead hand,</i>
<i>as he used to take it when she was alive</i>

40:44.400 --> 40:47.153
<i>to force her to groom him,</i>
<i>which is comforting for them.</i>

40:47.695 --> 40:51.657
<i>But, of course, nothing happened.</i>
<i>And that was the beginning of the end.</i>

40:51.740 --> 40:52.950
<i>He wouldn't eat.</i>

40:53.492 --> 40:56.328
<i>And three weeks after his mother died,</i>

40:56.996 --> 40:58.038
<i>he died too.</i>

40:58.122 --> 40:59.623
<i>And he clearly died of grief.</i>

40:59.707 --> 41:02.793
<i>He just could not cope without his mother.</i>

41:06.797 --> 41:11.177
<i>When my detailed descriptions</i>
<i>started circulating,</i>

<i>And you say, "Mamma mia!"</i>

42:52.611 --> 42:54.738
