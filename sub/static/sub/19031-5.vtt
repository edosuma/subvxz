WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.335
Dr. D, I can't believe
you're actually leaving us.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.203
You were, like,
the greatest teacher ever.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.673
Oh, Lucy.

00:08.708 --> 00:13.645
But you'll always carry a piece of me
with you. I'll be here and I'll be here.

00:14.414 --> 00:15.472
My stomach?

00:15.515 --> 00:18.951
Well, I would have touched your heart,
but I did that to another female student

00:18.985 --> 00:22.614
and it resulted in me having to watch
a four-hour video called Boundaries.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.680
So, teacher evaluations are due,

00:24.724 --> 00:28.558
and I am going to use gold stars
and pony stickers for yours.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.360
Lucy, that's sweet,
but I don't care

00:30.397 --> 00:32.194
about those silly evaluations.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.496
Yes. Lucy's in the bag.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.530
But while I went out of my way
to connect with these kids,

00:37.570 --> 00:39.800
Dr. Cox had a different approach.

00:39.839 --> 00:41.932
All right, then,
you gaggle of mini-murderers,

00:41.975 --> 00:44.944
I'm going to make these evaluations
very easy for you.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.675
Here are some adjectives
that describe my teaching style.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.878
"Abusive," "humiliating," "tyrannical"
and "buttery."

00:51.918 --> 00:54.819
Why "buttery"?
Because I don't care what you write.

00:54.854 --> 00:59.052
Moving on. It is time for your
final practical exam of the quarter,

00:59.092 --> 01:01.652
learning how to draw blood
from an actual human being.

01:01.694 --> 01:04.288
Sadly, most of you will pass,

01:04.431 --> 01:08.162
but there are one or two of you
out there who will botch this miserably,

01:08.201 --> 01:11.170
proving once and for all
that you don't belong here.

01:11.204 --> 01:16.198
And, my God,
it's like it's Christmas Eve

01:16.242 --> 01:20.770
and one of you is just a big box
of failure waiting to be unwrapped.

01:20.814 --> 01:24.841
I want to open you,
I want to open you so bad, but no,

01:26.019 --> 01:30.285
I'm gonna wait, because the waiting
makes it so much sweeter.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.091
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:36.529 --> 01:40.226
"Your stupidity is so intense
it's burning me in the face."

01:40.266 --> 01:44.134
Oh, Dr. Cox is on a tear today.
I bet you five bucks this kid cries.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.262
No, he's not a crier.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.603
He's the kind of guy who eats
to make the sad go away.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.270
Is it wrong that so much of what bonds
us is sex and other people's pain?

01:52.579 --> 01:53.705
Don't forget our hatred of art.

01:53.746 --> 01:56.874
Yeah, art's the worst. Here he comes.

02:00.587 --> 02:04.318
I win. But I actually cheated.
I had inside info.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.016
I slept with that dude
during my fatty phase.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.011 --> 02:26.808
Powerful stuff, huh?

02:31.217 --> 02:35.244
Six weeks ago,
I wrote one word on the board.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.486
"Medicine." So, what's the definition?

02:39.659 --> 02:43.322
Well, if you believe the silly dictionary,
it says that it's

02:43.363 --> 02:46.821
"the science of health maintenance
and the prevention of disease."

02:46.866 --> 02:50.427
Snore. I think we're all dictionaries.

02:50.870 --> 02:57.298
We all edit the user-generated
encyclopedias of our hearts.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.082
Those balloons were supposed to fall
at the end of my speech.

03:11.124 --> 03:14.560
Okay. In front of you
are teacher evaluations.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.159
Be honest.

03:16.196 --> 03:20.428
I'm trying to mold your minds,
not win some sort of popularity contest.

03:20.466 --> 03:23.299
Sweet! Coupon for two dollars
off fro-yo.

03:23.436 --> 03:27.634
Yeah, and tell them Dr. D sent you.
You'll get a little extra whip.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.701
Great last class, buddy.

03:31.744 --> 03:33.302
It's your last day.
What do you want to do?

03:33.346 --> 03:35.314
I don't know, Turk.
I've left so many times,

03:35.348 --> 03:38.442
I've come back so many times.
Even I'm confused.

03:38.484 --> 03:41.817
I think we should just
sit this one out, old friend.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.947
- I'm gonna need a minute.
- Turk, no.

03:47.493 --> 03:50.326
- Hey, Luce, guess what I see?
- Don't say it.

03:50.363 --> 03:54.561
- "I see dead people."
- Yep. Fifteenth time's the charm.

03:57.003 --> 04:00.234
Hey, Dr. Cox.
I was just practicing for your exam.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.203
Taking blood is so easy.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.335
Dynamite work.
But here's the thing there.

04:04.377 --> 04:07.369
You're going to have to do this
on a person who still has blood

04:07.413 --> 04:11.144
and can feel pain,
not like this lump of flesh.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.144
- Did you just flick that cadaver's ear?
- Yes.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.487
I come down here to both increase
my hand strength and relax.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.618
Some people go on retreats.
I flick the dead.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.254
Huh.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.059
That is so awesome.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.565
The teacher evaluations were in.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.365
Okay, what's it say, Turk? I can't look!

04:31.671 --> 04:34.606
- Dude, you're number one.
- Yes! That's the part I wanted.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.439
This reminds me of when I was in my
theater camp's production of Oliver!

04:37.477 --> 04:41.743
I still remember my one line.
"No, thank you. I don't like soup."

04:42.115 --> 04:43.446
Hmm.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.213
Hey, Perry, don't you want to see
where you're ranked?

04:46.252 --> 04:48.447
I'm quite sure I'm last.
I could not care less.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.682
Don't feel bad, Perry.

04:49.722 --> 04:52.987
Maybe you could go find some solace
in one of your gym workouts.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.220
Maybe.

04:54.494 --> 04:55.756
Ow!

04:56.195 --> 04:59.653
I don't know how,
but that knocked the wind out of me.

05:15.214 --> 05:17.273
"Mesmerizing," "Hilarious,"

05:17.317 --> 05:20.718
"If you only take one class this year,
make it Dr. D's.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.779
"It's the nonstop thrill-ride
of the quarter."

05:24.657 --> 05:28.252
You know, Perry, you might want
to watch a video called Boundaries,

05:28.294 --> 05:30.592
especially the section on roughhousing.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.063
Suck it up, Mary Lou.

05:32.098 --> 05:36.558
You cannot get under my skin today.
Not with reviews like these.

05:37.003 --> 05:42.873
Wow. Wrong. Really wrong.
And what is this?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.335
- What is what?
- "Needy," "Desperate,"

05:46.379 --> 05:49.871
"Light on medical knowledge,
heavy on Broadway trivia."

05:51.284 --> 05:54.117
He wrote that I don't care
about teaching

05:55.355 --> 05:58.381
and I just want people to like me.
I'm a fool.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.425
I know. It's beautiful.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.428
God, I wish these things
weren't anonymous.

06:02.462 --> 06:05.431
I'd like to take this student out
and buy him a steak.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.592
He nailed it. All the best.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.334
- Turk, am I needy?
- No.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.362
Tell me a hundred times.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.009
Thanks for letting me
practice on you, Dr. D.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.410
I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time with this procedure.

06:20.446 --> 06:24.007
How could anybody hate me?
I'm literally bleeding for you guys.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.951
That's a muscle.
Aim for the blue lines.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.682
Sorry. I don't know why I can't get this.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.553
I used to have a problem
with the same thing,

06:31.591 --> 06:34.788
but then I realized you just gotta
pretend the needle's your friend.

06:34.827 --> 06:36.761
Be careful, though.
I told that to a med student once

06:36.796 --> 06:38.388
and he became a heroin addict.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.558
But just pretend
the needle's your buddy

06:40.600 --> 06:42.795
and you two are doing
something you love to do.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.302
Like roller skating?

06:44.337 --> 06:47.670
I would have said ice dancing,
but to each their own.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.402
Here goes nothing.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.642
I did it!

06:53.913 --> 06:56.507
Dr. D, thanks for always helping me
through the tough stuff.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.608
It's okay.
Maybe you should practice on,

06:58.651 --> 07:01.984
like, a student partner or something.
Preferably someone who can't feel pain.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.318
Like the Incredible Hulk.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.450
The Hulk can feel pain, Turk.
Also, lasers hurt him.

07:06.492 --> 07:07.823
Hmm.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.987
Dude, I hope you paged me
'cause you came to your senses

07:10.029 --> 07:12.122
and realized
that we need to do one last eagle.

07:12.165 --> 07:15.134
- Eagles are played out, Turk.
- How dare you?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.665
You and I are gonna find the kid
that torched me.

07:17.703 --> 07:21.503
You said you wanted to do something
this last week. This is gonna be fun.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.601
We'll be like
the interracial Hardy Boys.

07:29.115 --> 07:34.052
Look. A clue!
A piece of Old Man Peterson's overalls.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.551
That means he's the Phantom
of CAT Scan Island.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.991
Dad's gonna be so proud of us,
black adopted brother.

07:42.728 --> 07:46.220
All right, I'm in, but you're buying me
a magnifying glass.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.730
- I got you a present.
- What is it?

07:48.768 --> 07:50.360
I don't know.
It came out of the guy in Room 12.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.201
That's sweet. Oh. Still warm.

07:54.740 --> 07:57.038
- Oh, God. Here's Sunny.
- Who's Sunny?

07:57.076 --> 07:59.237
Sunny is a wicker basket
of adorable kittens

07:59.278 --> 08:02.213
sliding down a shimmering rainbow.
Head for the hills.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.306
Hi, guys!

08:03.349 --> 08:05.340
It's too late.
If she talks to me, shoot me.

08:05.384 --> 08:10.048
Denise, is this Drew?
You said he was handsome, but wow!

08:10.356 --> 08:11.414
What's happening?

08:11.457 --> 08:14.290
I can't believe
Denise found that special someone.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.558
When I first met her, I thought, "This
woman is probably going to die alone,"

08:17.597 --> 08:20.259
but here she is, and here you are,
and here I am asking you guys

08:20.299 --> 08:22.358
if you'd like to go on a double date
with me and Keyshawn.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.062
- I guess.
- Yes!

08:25.004 --> 08:27.632
- We're not doing that.
- Of course not.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.073
I was gonna say yes,
then call her at the last minute,

08:30.109 --> 08:32.873
tell her I'm sick,
then change my cell phone number.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.403
Yeah, I owe her that.
She is my closest female friend.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.573
Hmm.

08:38.116 --> 08:41.644
Cole, will you please be
my blood buddy for Dr. Cox's exam?

08:41.687 --> 08:45.623
Mmm. Sorry, baby. No can do.
Doc says I got tiny baby veins.

08:45.691 --> 08:49.457
Something to do with my moms
eating blowfish in the third tri-mo.

08:49.495 --> 08:53.329
Besides, I've seen you
take blood before, and you suck at it.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.899
Somebody help me! I have a family!

08:59.138 --> 09:03.507
He's dealt with worse. He came
to this country on a boat made of tires.

09:04.243 --> 09:10.375
Okay, I guess I am gonna have
to break out the big guns.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.547
No blood, no sex.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.255
Turk and I were hard at work,

09:19.292 --> 09:22.591
trying to solve
The Mystery of the Feelings Hurter.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.256
Now, do you see how the "R's"
in this evaluation form

09:25.298 --> 09:28.495
are the same as in this test
from three months ago?

09:28.534 --> 09:32.163
- Dude, I totally see it.
- Hello, Barry Friedman.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.697
Hacking into the med school files
right now.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.038
- You can hack?
- No, I have a password.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.510
It just sounded cooler. We're in.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.437
Tell me a story, Turk.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.914
Barry Friedman.
Lives in the east dorms.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.386
Okay. Buckle up, Bar.
We're coming for you.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.051
Which way is east?

09:54.860 --> 10:00.355
- Hey! So, what's the plan for tonight?
- Drew doesn't want to go.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.503
- Bummer. Rain check?
- Yeah, definitely.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.662
- Yes! Look forward to it.
- No. Not happening.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.540
Oh.

10:10.576 --> 10:13.807
How beautifully ironic
that the queen of sensible slacks

10:13.846 --> 10:16.576
is not even wearing the pants
in her very own relationship.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.107
- What are you talking about?
- Now, I saw how fast Drew

10:19.151 --> 10:21.551
put the kibosh
on that double-dating idea.

10:21.587 --> 10:25.614
Missy, you realize you're shoulder-deep
in that inevitable turf war

10:25.658 --> 10:28.286
that defines modern coupledom,
and psst...

10:29.528 --> 10:31.621
He is winning.

10:32.398 --> 10:37.062
And make no mistake about it.
Early victories are huge.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.333
In our first month dating,
Jordan made me give up tomatoes,

10:40.373 --> 10:43.171
speaking to my mother
and my ponytail.

10:43.609 --> 10:46.271
Honest to God,
I can still feel it some mornings.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.143
That's not the way it is
with Drew and me.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.272
I see your point.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.546
Because you are so very different
from every other couple

10:52.585 --> 10:55.452
in the history of doomed relationships.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.654
Note to self. They're different.

11:02.461 --> 11:05.294
I think this is Barry Friedman's room.
Twenty-three, right?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.390
Turk, I can see the number "23"
from here.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.401
We don't need
that stupid magnifying glass.

11:09.435 --> 11:12.199
Damn, why didn't I get
one of those for me?

11:12.238 --> 11:15.696
You've gotta be careful
when you're working a mystery.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.177
- Dr. Kelso?
- Well, well.

11:25.985 --> 11:30.285
Well, come in or shut the door.
You're letting all the funk out.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.521
Because you might not like
what you find.

11:33.559 --> 11:36.119
Hey, I know you were thinking
of Chinese food tonight,

11:36.162 --> 11:37.754
but I want to do Italian.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.287
- Okay.
- Great.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.929
Perfect.

11:56.148 --> 12:00.244
Especially if what you discover
is that you're still totally lost.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.046
Come on, girl, do it. Make me bleed!

12:05.191 --> 12:08.649
I can't do it.
I'm never gonna be able to do it.

12:09.428 --> 12:12.454
There's my big box of failure.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.395
Oh, Santa, you got my letters,
you fat bastard.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.567
Crap.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.584
- Dr. Kelso, why are you here?
- This is my sex pad.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.483
And what have you done
with Barry Friedman?

12:36.522 --> 12:39.320
He dropped out of med school
two weeks after it started.

12:39.358 --> 12:42.418
I've been using his dorm room
as my love nest.

12:43.062 --> 12:46.725
I can't get with a gal in the same bed
I shared with Enid.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.164
Gives me the softies.

12:49.368 --> 12:52.735
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, I threw up in my mouth a little.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.734
- Well, looks like we hit a dead end.
- Dear God, Newbie.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.937
Don't tell me you're still looking
for the visionary

12:58.978 --> 13:01.071
- who gave you the bad review.
- Yes, I am.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.547
I know you don't give a damn
about what students think,

13:03.582 --> 13:06.107
but I want them to remember me
as someone who was nurturing.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.414
So, let me get this straight.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.581
You're going to find this kid,
then what?

13:11.123 --> 13:14.684
- I'm gonna change his mind.
- Excellent use of your time.

13:16.595 --> 13:19.155
Forget him.
Turk, gather all the students

13:19.198 --> 13:20.825
- in the lecture hall.
- All of them?

13:20.866 --> 13:23.027
Just lure them there
with something young people like,

13:23.068 --> 13:25.730
like pizza or Rob Schneider.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.833
- So, pizza?
- Sure.

13:27.873 --> 13:28.999
Okay.

13:29.675 --> 13:33.406
Dr. D, I really need you to be
my blood buddy for the exam.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.845
Lucy, I'm glad
that I make you feel comfortable, but...

13:35.881 --> 13:37.678
If you could just help me
get through this one,

13:37.716 --> 13:39.684
I know next time I can do it on my own.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.913
It's just that
I'm working a case right now,

13:41.954 --> 13:45.720
and I'm this close
to cracking this mother wide open.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.961
Okay, I know Dr. D can't resist
my puppy-dog look.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.863
Crap, she's puppy-dogging me.
Be strong.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.093
I'll do whatever it is
that you want me to do.

13:58.137 --> 13:59.502
Thank you.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.709
We're going to dinner
with Sunny and Keyshawn.

14:05.744 --> 14:09.145
- I thought you didn't want to go.
- Well, now I do. Wear your black shirt,

14:09.181 --> 14:13.709
and dial the hair gel back. You're not
doing the weather on Channel 7.

14:14.854 --> 14:19.257
So who gave Dr. Dorian
a negative review?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.260
Many of you had motives.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.422
Mary. There was
the unfortunate incident

14:25.464 --> 14:28.399
where I called you Mark
for the first part of the quarter.

14:28.434 --> 14:33.030
But now I'm a major supporter of your
softball team, so we worked that out.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.633
Jeremy. Of course I suspected you.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.775
You take a little too long
to laugh at my jokes,

14:39.812 --> 14:42.781
but I forgot to account
for your interpreter.

14:43.816 --> 14:47.308
I apologize for not giving you
a proper "hearing."

14:49.255 --> 14:50.950
Thank you, Jeremy.

14:51.123 --> 14:54.752
Dr. Turk and I are going
to keep you in here all day

14:55.194 --> 14:58.789
until whomever gave me
the negative review steps forward.

14:59.265 --> 15:03.167
Who amongst you has the courage
to step forward and say,

15:03.202 --> 15:05.500
"Hey! I am the coward!"

15:06.505 --> 15:08.097
Dear Lord, Newbie.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.007
It was me.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.206
Perry?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.152
Why would you do that to me?

15:24.189 --> 15:26.714
'Cause, as always,
pushing your buttons amuses me,

15:26.759 --> 15:29.091
and I know you don't think
I have anything left to teach you,

15:29.128 --> 15:33.462
but maybe I wanted you to see
just how ridiculous you truly are,

15:33.499 --> 15:35.831
constantly chasing their approval.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.995
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Dorian,
I just wanted to make sure

15:38.037 --> 15:39.834
you were still going
to be my blood buddy.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.396
I'll be there.

15:42.308 --> 15:45.334
- What?
- You can't even help yourself, can you?

15:46.111 --> 15:48.773
Dorian, in order for these kids
to really learn,

15:48.814 --> 15:51.578
sooner or later
you gotta let go of their hands.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.178
So, I'm supposed to be like you
and just rule by fear?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.183
Perry, they hate you.

15:57.222 --> 16:00.749
Yes, they do, and sure,
I could be a little bit kinder,

16:01.060 --> 16:03.654
but that's not going to happen,
and here's why.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.563
We're creating doctors,
not kindergartners.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.467
- They need me.
- Do they?

16:09.768 --> 16:12.532
Because I don't ever remember
holding your smooth little doll hand,

16:12.571 --> 16:15.870
and you turned out to be
not too horrible a doctor.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.510
So I'm here
for our ridiculous couples' date.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.713
- Where are they?
- They're at the bar.

16:27.753 --> 16:30.415
I told them they couldn't sit with us.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.251
Okay, let's sneak out the back
and go play air hockey.

16:34.293 --> 16:38.127
- Why did you make me come here?
- So I could win, which I did.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.259
Look, I had to do something.
You were trying to make a power play.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.360
No. I just didn't want to go
on some stupid double date.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.064
So far this has just been
a hook-up thing.

16:46.105 --> 16:49.666
Why are you acting like
we're in some big, serious relationship?

16:49.708 --> 16:51.733
I mean, don't get me wrong,
not that I'm against it.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.541
Normally, by now I would have
sabotaged this by, I don't know,

16:54.580 --> 16:57.174
getting hammered at Thanksgiving
and making out with one of your aunts,

16:57.216 --> 17:00.276
and I haven't done that,
and I think that's good.

17:00.319 --> 17:02.310
I feel like I'm growing.

17:03.489 --> 17:06.151
You know what? I'm into it if you are.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.453
Do you want to talk about us
being in a relationship?

17:11.763 --> 17:14.528
I have news for you.
We're in a relationship.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.557
- What?
- Yeah, I decided, like, a month ago.

17:16.602 --> 17:17.796
I didn't tell you?

17:24.510 --> 17:26.876
Damn it. I actually like you.

17:29.848 --> 17:34.046
- You stole from me?
- "Going to steal." Big difference.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.249
Come on, Dr. D.
Where are you?

17:39.992 --> 17:41.118
Done.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.457
That vein didn't stand a chance.
I owned that bitch.

17:44.496 --> 17:49.126
As much as it pains me to admit it,
that "bitch" is indeed yours. Well done.

17:49.568 --> 17:53.095
- Jingle Bells, you're next.
- Great. Yes.

17:53.539 --> 17:57.669
Let me just pop up front

17:57.709 --> 18:02.271
- and I will take some blood.
- What are you doing?

18:02.848 --> 18:07.217
Stalling until Dr. Dorian gets here.
He's on his way,

18:07.786 --> 18:13.315
and when he gets here,
I am going to drain his main vein.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.462
You have five minutes.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.891
- So we are in a relationship?
- Yeah.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.562
Are there any other decisions that
you made that I need to know about?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.764
- I mean, are we exclusive?
- You are.

18:26.805 --> 18:30.104
But don't worry,
we'll go over all the rules later.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.737
Hey, guys. This is Keyshawn.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.142
- He's da bomb.
- That's great.

18:36.181 --> 18:39.116
You order drinks,
I'm gonna go hit the head.

18:41.420 --> 18:45.186
- What should we order for her?
- Yeah, she's not coming back.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.989
No problem.
It just means more Drew time.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.456
Being there for someone
is never easy.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.656
You don't want to let down the people
you care about.

18:55.033 --> 18:59.936
- Time's up. Do it now or fail.
- But I don't have a partner.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.706
Yeah, you do.

19:04.443 --> 19:07.640
- Just remember, you're terrified of me.
- I am.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.510
Go ahead.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.612
But sometimes,
being there for someone

19:15.654 --> 19:17.884
means not being there at all.

19:20.926 --> 19:24.418
The needle is my friend.
The needle is my friend.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.713
- I did it. I actually did it.
- You most certainly did.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.181
And the good news is that med school
gets a lot easier after this.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.652
- Really?
- No.

19:49.755 --> 19:50.813
No.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.586
Hey. Thanks a lot for not showing up.

19:55.827 --> 19:59.558
By the way, I did it all on my own
and I didn't need you after all.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.498
That's good, isn't it?

20:04.836 --> 20:05.962
Lucy?

20:08.173 --> 20:09.538
Good luck.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.044
Well, this is it. I can't believe you.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.173
I can't believe you don't want
to do one last eagle.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.083
This could be our last eagle
before our next last eagle.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.018
Turk, gather the students.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.352
All right, but they're not gonna fall
for Rob Schneider again.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.483
Then pull out the big guns.
Tell them it's the cast of Twilight.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.086
- Kids love sexy vampires.
- I'm on it.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.461
Cast of Twilight is in the quad!

20:32.497 --> 20:35.364
- Come on!
- Cast of Twilight is in the quad.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.831
- J.D., are we really doing this?
- Yes, Turk.

20:37.869 --> 20:43.239
It's time to finally realize the dream.
Super Eagle!

20:43.408 --> 20:45.273
Super Eagle!

20:47.446 --> 20:51.007
- Look who it is.
- Oh, dear God.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.713
Now, that is ridiculous. What is it?

20:56.121 --> 20:59.090
That is my prescription fiber drink
with rum.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.416
I love that.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.423
Hey, you got any of those wiener pills?

21:04.529 --> 21:07.259
Who do you think
you're talking to, son?

21:07.366 --> 21:09.698
I'll give you one for 10 bucks.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.196
- Got change for a $20?
- Nope.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.068
We'll drop a couple of these bad boys

21:14.106 --> 21:17.132
and go trolling for ladies
at the airport bar.

21:17.643 --> 21:22.637
- Will you be my grandpa?
- Why, sure, little man. Sure.
