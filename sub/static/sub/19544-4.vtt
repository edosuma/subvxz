00:08.300 --> 00:13.636
A new hero, Great Saiyaman,
is born in Satan City.

00:15.641 --> 00:19.850
Satan's daughter, Videl, has her
suspicions that his true identity

00:20.062 --> 00:24.101
is that of her classmate, Son Gohan.

"A Monster is Spirited Away!
The Culprit is Great Saiyaman?!"

02:14.927 --> 02:17.293
Where did Chibi go?

02:17.513 --> 02:21.051
He was here when we came to check
on him two days ago, Big Brother.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.222
He just barely hatched out of his egg.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.221
He shouldn't be able to fly yet, huh?

02:25.437 --> 02:29.225
Come to think of it, I don't see
the Toto couple around, either.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.477
All right, why don't we
look around a little more?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.194
Mm-hmm!

02:37.533 --> 02:40.115
Oh, yeah? You didn't find him?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.067
I wonder if anything happened.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.539
The circus show, which opens today,

02:44.748 --> 02:47.535
is garnering attention for its baby monster.

02:47.751 --> 02:51.118
This unusual baby was caught
by Mr. Musuka, the promoter,

02:51.338 --> 02:54.546
the other day, and the spectators
seem to be thrilled

02:54.758 --> 02:56.498
by his lovable appearance.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.753
Ah, it's Chibi!

02:57.970 --> 03:01.303
Tomorrow, on Saturday,
even more people are sure to crowd in.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.598
What do you mean,
lovable appearance? He's spooked.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.516
I'm sure he must have been taken away

03:06.728 --> 03:08.389
when the Toto couple were gone.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.187
Otherwise, the Totos wouldn't
stand back and do nothing.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.812
Look at poor Chibi, Big Brother...

03:14.027 --> 03:17.815
Don't you worry, Goten.
You just let Big Brother handle this.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.904
Hmm? This is the place.

03:33.005 --> 03:37.339
Chibi, you poor thing. I'm going
to get you out of this, okay?

03:39.803 --> 03:41.168
Excuse me...

03:41.388 --> 03:44.926
Are you the man in charge
of this circus troupe?

03:45.142 --> 03:47.383
Who are you?

03:47.603 --> 03:51.437
Please return the little fellow
back to the mountains. I beg you.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.730
Hmph, don't be ridiculous.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.479
l've booked an appearance
in Metro North next.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.437
I worked hard to finally find this critter.

03:59.656 --> 04:03.069
I plan to earn a fortune off of it.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.112
Earn?

04:05.329 --> 04:08.366
It's beyond cruel that you
would kidnap the little guy

04:08.582 --> 04:10.493
and then use him to make money!

04:10.709 --> 04:13.826
Shut up! I'm the one who caught it!

04:14.046 --> 04:15.627
Whatever I do with it is up to me!

04:15.839 --> 04:20.208
Damn it, you expect me to let my
golden goose get away from me?

04:25.474 --> 04:27.305
Guess I'll wait until nighttime.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.768
Yay!

04:28.977 --> 04:32.936
I'll bet Chibi wants to hurry back
to his mother and father, too.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.481
And I'm sure the Totos
are worried about Chibi.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.730
Hold on. You don't suppose the Totos

04:39.947 --> 04:42.313
are out looking for the
missing Chibi right now...

04:42.532 --> 04:45.069
If that's true, this could mean big trouble!

04:56.838 --> 04:58.544
You behave yourself.

05:03.428 --> 05:07.671
Chibi, you can relax now. It's me, Gohan.

05:11.561 --> 05:15.975
Everything's okay now. Come on,
let's get you back to your parents.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.056
All righty...

05:18.276 --> 05:20.688
Who are you?!

05:20.904 --> 05:22.314
I'm a champion ofjustice!

05:22.531 --> 05:24.396
Why you little thief!

05:24.616 --> 05:26.402
You've got it wrong!

05:32.374 --> 05:35.207
lt's dangerous swinging this thing around.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.085
What a freak this guy is...!

05:39.297 --> 05:40.878
Okay, let's go!

05:43.760 --> 05:47.173
W-We've got a problem, Mr. Musuka!
The monster has been kidnapped!

05:47.389 --> 05:50.096
W-What?!

05:55.022 --> 05:56.808
W-Whoa!

05:58.900 --> 06:02.518
H-Hey, what's the matter?
Don't make this difficult.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.605
Don't tell me you're afraid of flying.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.242
I guess we'll have to flee on foot.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.197
You're still a baby,
so what other choice is there?

06:14.416 --> 06:18.204
But someday, you'll have
to fly on your own, Chibi.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.666
There's the culprit! Arrest him!

06:22.883 --> 06:26.341
We can't afford to let him get away
just because he's the Great Saiyaman!

06:26.553 --> 06:28.965
Give back the monster, nice and easy!

06:29.181 --> 06:31.046
I can't do that!

06:52.329 --> 06:53.409
All right, now's my chance!

06:53.622 --> 06:55.829
l have to hurry out of the city...

07:01.046 --> 07:03.378
Hold it right there, Great Saiyaman!

07:05.550 --> 07:06.881
You call yourself a champion of justice,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.130
then go around acting
like a thief? That's a laugh,

07:09.346 --> 07:10.631
Great Saiyaman!

07:10.847 --> 07:12.587
A thief, you say?

07:12.808 --> 07:16.721
Videl-san, please understand,
he's still just a baby.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.973
The best thing to do is
return him to his parents.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.645
Otherwise, something terrible will happen.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.973
Hand over the monster, nice and easy!

07:23.193 --> 07:24.649
If you insist on refusing,

07:24.861 --> 07:27.728
then I will take him back by force if I have to!

07:31.743 --> 07:35.031
And don't blame me if I beat you
and that mask gets taken off,

07:35.247 --> 07:37.158
Great Saiyaman!

07:43.213 --> 07:44.874
What are you waiting around for?!

07:45.090 --> 07:48.173
It's the police's job to arrest thieves, isn't it?!

07:48.385 --> 07:51.047
It's all right. We can let Videl-san handle this.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.003
Who is that girl?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.760
She's Mister Satan's daughter, Videl-san.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.514
The daughter of the strongest man
in the world, Mister Satan?

07:59.729 --> 08:02.857
Of all the times to bump into Videl-san.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.022
What a mess.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.783
P-Please don't do this, Videl-san!

08:14.995 --> 08:16.201
Are you losing your nerve?

08:16.413 --> 08:19.155
Or if, rather, you think I'm
a soft touch because I'm a girl,

08:19.374 --> 08:23.708
I'll show you just how
greatly mistaken you are.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.510
While I do want to know who you are,

08:34.722 --> 08:37.931
I've always been curious
about how strong you are, too.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.556
This is the perfect opportunity.
You don't have to hold back.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.931
I don't know what to say.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.560
I'm going to give you everything I've got!

08:55.368 --> 08:56.528
That's Videl-san for you.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.862
At the very least, she's far
stronger than Mister Satan.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.166
l'm
s
o
rryI

09:05.378 --> 09:07.630
What are you apologizing for?!

09:07.839 --> 09:09.579
Now's m chance.
Y

09:14.262 --> 09:16.469
You dare to defy me?!

09:17.891 --> 09:22.100
--Chibi!
--You should be more worried about
yourself than him, Great Saiyaman!

09:23.980 --> 09:24.685
You've got it wrong!

09:24.898 --> 09:26.263
What have I got wrong?!

09:26.483 --> 09:28.394
We have to give Chibi back quick,

09:28.610 --> 09:31.067
or it could be really bad news
for the whole city!

09:31.279 --> 09:32.610
It's the truth, Videl-san!

09:32.822 --> 09:36.064
Saying that to try to get
away from me won't work!

09:36.284 --> 09:38.491
Please understand, Videl-san!

09:42.207 --> 09:44.664
That's it.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.912
It wouldn't be fun any other way!

09:47.128 --> 09:49.744
Just what can I do to make her understand?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.677
Chibi!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.977
You be quiet, you little monster!

10:06.189 --> 10:08.305
O-Oh, no...

10:11.194 --> 10:12.900
Monsters!

10:17.742 --> 10:19.278
F-Fire!

10:23.623 --> 10:28.868
Stop! The Toto couple just
came to get their baby back!

10:29.087 --> 10:32.375
Videl-san, please, bring Chibi along!

10:32.590 --> 10:35.627
The Toto couple should calm down
once we return Chibi to them!

10:35.844 --> 10:36.833
Oh, okay...

10:37.053 --> 10:39.385
Come on, quickly! Otherwise, this will get ugly!

10:39.597 --> 10:41.133
A-All right!

10:42.309 --> 10:43.799
Don't shoot!

10:48.857 --> 10:52.145
Calm down, Toto!
Here, we're giving you Chibi back!

10:52.360 --> 10:54.316
So don't stay mad any longer!

10:57.240 --> 11:00.448
Are you friends with those monsters?!

11:00.660 --> 11:03.117
Yeah. We've played together
ever since I was little.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.740
Right now, they're all
worked up and acting violent,

11:04.956 --> 11:06.787
but they really are nice creatures.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.208
They should know who I am,
even transformed like this.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.219
Toto, it's me! Have you forgotten?!
It's me, Goha--

11:21.431 --> 11:22.295
Huh?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.471
Er, nothing, nothing, nothing...!

11:24.684 --> 11:28.677
By any chance, were you
just about to say "Gohan"?!

11:28.897 --> 11:30.603
V-Videl-san, stand aside!

11:30.815 --> 11:34.273
No way! You're really
Son Gohan-kun after all, aren't you?!

11:34.486 --> 11:37.444
Well? I'm not going away until you say it!

11:37.655 --> 11:40.397
What are you talking about,
at a time like this?!

11:41.701 --> 11:43.202
Toto!

11:47.248 --> 11:48.988
W-What are you doing?!

11:50.835 --> 11:53.827
I'm not about to let you have my money tree!

11:54.047 --> 11:55.162
I'm gonna drive you away!

11:55.382 --> 11:56.872
Stop!

12:04.849 --> 12:07.226
Look out, Videl-san!

12:07.435 --> 12:09.175
Toto, I'm sorry!

12:16.736 --> 12:20.900
Don't worry, Chibi.
Your father is just knocked out.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.441
Great Saiyaman...

12:30.792 --> 12:34.535
Videl-san, I'll let you take it from here. Bye!

12:39.300 --> 12:40.915
Good for you, Chibi.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.923
I guess you're not afraid to fly
when you're with your mother.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.051
Man, you are so fickle!

12:48.685 --> 12:52.348
Damn it! Next time, I'll catch
both the baby and the parents!

12:52.564 --> 12:56.307
You do that, and I swear
I'll make you pay for it!

12:56.526 --> 12:57.857
Er, uh...

12:58.069 --> 12:59.775
You've more than met your match there.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.024
I think you'd better give it up.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.914
Hooray! Thank goodness you're all safe!

13:25.388 --> 13:28.004
Big Brother, thank you!

13:43.907 --> 13:47.399
Mm, no matter how often I watch,
it's magnificent, if I do say so myself.

13:48.411 --> 13:52.450
Videl, if your goal is to be
a champion like your papa,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.156
you have to train yourself more and more.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.334
The Tenkaichi Budokai
tournament, huh? What fun.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.958
But Papa, I've heard that
the champion before you

14:01.174 --> 14:02.789
was also pretty strong.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.967
Ah, you mean that guy Son Goku?

14:06.179 --> 14:09.046
He's a mystery man,
who uses lots of absurd tricks.

14:09.265 --> 14:13.304
But ability-wise, he couldn't even
hold a candle to me, you know.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.476
If we had fought each other
at the last tournament,

14:15.688 --> 14:18.771
there's no question that
your papa would have beat him.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.605
Son? Son Goku?

14:25.365 --> 14:28.732
Oh, no, I'm going to be tardy!

14:28.952 --> 14:30.738
Morning, Son Gohan-kun.

14:30.954 --> 14:34.162
Ah, Videl-san, good morning.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.917
Thanks for yesterday.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.254
Oh, no, I'm just glad
you're safe, too, Videl-san.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.753
You can't hide it anymore.
The Great Saiyaman's true identity

14:45.969 --> 14:48.051
is you, Son Gohan-kun, isn't it?

14:48.263 --> 14:50.504
O-Oh, no! And after I'd gone through

14:50.723 --> 14:53.965
such an impeccable transformation, too...

15:02.777 --> 15:03.732
I thought there was something up

15:03.945 --> 15:05.856
with that voice and the way you spoke.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.439
Besides, why would you go to
the trouble of that crazy outfit?

15:09.659 --> 15:11.615
Oh, well, you see...

15:11.828 --> 15:13.989
...if I wanted to live a normal life
around my friends,

15:14.205 --> 15:16.196
I couldn't let on that l was so strong.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.496
So that's why...

15:17.709 --> 15:18.539
Friends?!

15:18.751 --> 15:20.036
Oh, well, you know...

15:20.253 --> 15:22.710
Say, you're the Golden Warrior,
too, aren't you?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.913
Oh, no, that's not me!

15:25.133 --> 15:26.122
I'm not so sure.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.298
|-|t's the truth!

15:28.511 --> 15:31.924
That part, at least, mustn't ever get out.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.346
Well, okay then.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.721
Videl-san, I really need you to
keep this a secret from the others.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.099
Yeah, well, I guess that depends.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.930
Tell me, you're going to enter

15:42.150 --> 15:44.983
the Tenkaichi Budokai tournament
next month, aren't you?

15:45.194 --> 15:46.900
Huh? The Tenkaichi Budokai?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.354
You don't know it?
It was a tournament to determine

15:49.574 --> 15:52.190
who the champion martial artist is,
and they're bringing it back.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.571
My papa was the champion
at the last tournament,

15:54.787 --> 15:56.448
and before that, although
I've never seen his face,

15:56.664 --> 15:59.201
it was some mystery man named Son Goku.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.577
Y-Yeah...?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.784
That's the same last name as you.

16:03.004 --> 16:06.622
|t's unusual nowadays to have a
separate first name and last name.

16:06.841 --> 16:12.177
I happen to think this Son Goku
person is your papa. Well?

16:12.388 --> 16:13.798
Er, w-well...

16:14.015 --> 16:15.971
The girl sure is sharp, isn't she?

16:16.184 --> 16:17.640
Yeah, I knew it.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.058
So what will it be? You're going to enter

16:19.270 --> 16:21.226
the Tenkaichi Budokai, of course, aren't you?

16:21.439 --> 16:22.474
If the child of the previous champion

16:22.690 --> 16:24.976
and the child of the champion
before that end up fighting,

16:25.193 --> 16:27.149
I think that's sure to be interesting.

16:27.362 --> 16:30.104
I mean, you knocked out that
monster with just one blow.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.984
I'm sure you'll do just fine.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.861
N-No, I'm going to pass.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.363
I'm not very interested in that sort of thing.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.404
If you don't enter, I'll tell everyone

16:39.624 --> 16:42.582
that the Great Saiyaman's true
identity is that of Son Gohan!

16:42.794 --> 16:45.536
Eh?! No, you can't!

16:45.755 --> 16:46.710
What's the big deal?

16:46.923 --> 16:49.460
If you enter as Great Saiyaman,
no one will know.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.461
B-But...

16:50.677 --> 16:51.837
You want to be exposed?

16:52.053 --> 16:54.590
V-Very well, I'll enter.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.263
All right, it's settled! Everyone else is so weak,

16:57.475 --> 16:59.591
and I wanted to have an opponent
who would be a challenge.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.097
Aw, shucks. Things have gotten all messed up.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.553
Oh, and Son Gohan-kun...

17:03.773 --> 17:04.683
Is there something else?

17:04.898 --> 17:07.982
Listen, teach me how to fly sometime, will you?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.105
It's no fair for you to be
the only one who can fly.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.356
Yeah, sure thing.

17:11.571 --> 17:15.986
Bye, now. I'm looking forward
to this, Son Gohan-kun!

17:16.202 --> 17:19.069
Videl-san is just too much for me.

17:23.542 --> 17:27.707
Oh, yeah, you're entering the
upcoming Tenkaichi Budokai?

17:27.922 --> 17:29.037
Yes.

17:29.257 --> 17:32.215
So, what made you decide to enter?

17:32.427 --> 17:33.382
Well, actually,

17:33.594 --> 17:38.133
one of my classmates is
Mister Satan's daughter...

17:38.349 --> 17:43.184
Huh? Mister Satan? Mister Satan is
that guy who was hopping around,

17:43.396 --> 17:45.352
getting in the way during
the fight against Cell, right?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.726
The world combat sports champion?

17:47.942 --> 17:51.560
So, his daughter is one
of your classmates, huh?

17:51.779 --> 17:54.816
Yes, but she really is a good person.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.900
Like me, she's the type that can't
turn a blind eye to bad people.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.987
But she managed to see
through my transformation,

18:02.206 --> 18:04.288
thanks to my voice and some scrapes.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.536
Anyhow, she told me that if I didn't enter

18:06.753 --> 18:10.746
the Tenkaichi Budokai with her,
she would reveal my identity.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.547
You botched it, huh?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.500
As far as that goes...

18:20.475 --> 18:24.388
As squared away as you are,
you've still got your father's blood.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.889
So, what?

18:26.105 --> 18:30.189
Do you want me to rework your
helmet so it changes your voice?

18:30.401 --> 18:34.144
No, it's not that. Apparently,
you're not allowed to wear helmets

18:34.363 --> 18:37.855
and other protective gear
at the Tenkaichi Budokai.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.612
So, I was wondering if there
was something I could use

18:40.828 --> 18:43.114
in place of this helmet.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.664
Mm-hmm, so what you're saying is,
you can't wear anything

18:46.876 --> 18:49.834
that would sharply reduce the
amount of damage you'd take?

18:55.009 --> 18:56.715
Well, that's no big deal, is it?

18:56.928 --> 19:00.091
It just has to hide the fact
that it's you, right, Gohan-kun?

19:01.933 --> 19:06.097
Indeed! It could be
something as simple as this!

19:06.312 --> 19:09.930
How about it, Trunks-kun? Looks cool, right?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.810
No comment.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.312
Even so, no matter how much you hold back,

19:14.529 --> 19:18.021
it's not going to be all that fun,
knowing you're a shoo-in to win, is it?

19:18.241 --> 19:19.981
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.608
This whatever-it's-called tournament...

19:22.829 --> 19:24.865
If you're going to enter,
then I'm entering, too.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.250
There may have been a huge gap
in power between us back then,

19:28.459 --> 19:30.040
but I'm not so sure about now.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.084
While you've been carried away
with living in peace,

19:32.296 --> 19:34.457
I've been continuing my training.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.041
Yep. The man doesn't do a lick of work.

19:38.261 --> 19:42.675
Just like your father.
I wonder, do Saiyans ever work?

19:44.308 --> 19:47.596
Awesome! Are Dad and
Gohan-san going to fight?!

19:47.812 --> 19:50.303
I'm entering, too!

19:50.523 --> 19:51.478
Gohan!

19:51.691 --> 19:56.105
F-Father... That's Father's voice!

19:56.320 --> 19:57.105
Son-kun?

19:57.321 --> 19:59.061
Kakarrot...?

19:59.282 --> 20:02.570
--Who's that?
--Father, it's you, right?!

20:02.785 --> 20:05.367
That's right. Long time no see, everyone!

20:05.580 --> 20:07.912
Have you been well, Father?!

20:08.124 --> 20:10.706
Yep. Well, I guess if you can
call this "being well," then yeah.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.419
Still dead, though.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.539
Can you really... Can you really
come to the Tenkaichi Budokai?!

20:17.758 --> 20:20.215
Yeah. If you ask Uranai Baba,

20:20.428 --> 20:23.386
you can come back for one day.

20:23.598 --> 20:26.510
I'm gonna make it the day
of the Tenkaichi Budokai.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.559
Gohan, you and Vegeta are
entering, right? I'm entering, too.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.637
Hooray! Banzai!

20:32.857 --> 20:34.347
Who is that?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.775
I'm looking forward to this,
Kakarrot. Come prepared.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.978
We raised my skills considerably.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.779
Mm-hmm. So have I, Vegeta.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.948
Okay then, see you at the Tenkaichi Budokai!

20:48.164 --> 20:49.995
Isn't that terrific, Gohan-kun?

20:52.209 --> 20:55.372
and Kuririn-kun and the others the good news.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.544
--Right!
--Tell me, who is that?

20:57.757 --> 21:01.215
Oh, yeah. Vegeta-san, you'll have
to wear a costume like this,

21:01.427 --> 21:03.588
so no one will know who you are.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.887
The hell I will! I don't care
who knows who I am!

21:08.184 --> 21:09.139
Okay!

21:09.352 --> 21:10.842
See you at the Tenkaichi Budokai!

21:11.062 --> 21:14.020
I'm going to go tell everyone else, right now!

21:14.231 --> 21:15.846
Tell them all we said hi!

21:16.067 --> 21:17.978
Bye-bye!

21:19.570 --> 21:23.028
Father is coming back! He's coming back!

21:23.240 --> 21:26.448
Amazingly, Goku is coming back.

21:26.661 --> 21:30.654
After entering the Tenkaichi Budokai
by an odd turn of events,

21:30.873 --> 21:35.583
this unexpected surprise has Gohan cheering.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.019
The Tenkaichi Budokai, huh?

22:45.239 --> 22:47.605
|f Gohan and Vegeta are entering,
then I'm entering, too!

22:47.825 --> 22:51.192
|f Father is coming back,
then I have to train hard.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.903
Goten, come give your big brother
a hand with training.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.363
Eep...!

22:55.583 --> 22:57.244
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.460 --> 22:59.075
"Entering the Tenkaichi Budokai!

22:59.295 --> 23:02.162
Goten Shows Off His Explosive
Power During Training!"

23:02.381 --> 23:05.873
Goten! You're not allowed to
go lookin' like that in public!
