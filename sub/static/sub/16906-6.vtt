WEBVTT

00:05.772 --> 00:07.115
What?

00:07.207 --> 00:09.278
Hold on.
Your name is Jack Donaghy?

00:09.376 --> 00:10.377
That's hilarious!

00:10.477 --> 00:12.650
I beg your pardon?
Where's your supervisor?

00:12.746 --> 00:14.384
Oh, you sound just like him!

00:14.481 --> 00:16.757
Now say, "Don't talk to me like that!
Don't you know who I am?"

00:17.050 --> 00:18.723
I will not say that!
Because you just ruined it!

00:21.488 --> 00:22.330
Jack Donaghy.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.261
What pray tell is so funny?

00:25.358 --> 00:26.302
<i>- I'll give you something...
- I'll give you something...</i>

00:26.393 --> 00:28.066
- ...to laugh about!
- ...to laugh about!

00:28.161 --> 00:29.367
I can't believer he is --

00:29.462 --> 00:32.442
Gabe, Google "Jack Donaghy"
and "black laughter".

00:32.531 --> 00:35.172
Hang on.
You're Jack Donaghy?

00:36.636 --> 00:40.174
Why am I suddenly an object
of derision in your "community"?

00:40.273 --> 00:42.685
I've championed diversity on NBC.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.757
I mean, we've got football.
That's pretty black, right?

00:45.845 --> 00:49.383
I'm laughing because
"Jack Donaghy" is the bad guy

00:49.482 --> 00:51.428
from Tracy Jordan's "Aunt Phatso" movie.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.122
<i>But you can't shut us down!</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:57.065
<i>The $25,000 rap competition
is in two days!</i>

00:57.157 --> 01:01.264
<i>Well, unless you can come up
with $25,000 in just two days,</i>

01:01.361 --> 01:05.673
<i>I'm turning this community center
into one of my garbage dumps!</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:08.512
<i>Ooooooh!
Damn you, Jack Donaghy!</i>

01:10.203 --> 01:11.079
<i>Aah!</i>

7x06 - Aunt Phatso vs. Jack Donaghy
Original Air Date on November 15, 2012

01:33.293 --> 01:34.772
Ugh, this is so embarrassing.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.364
I accidentally wore my tap shoes today.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.102
I might as well do my act.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.677
Now, imagine I'm wearing underwear.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.305
Hazel, what did I tell you the last
time you tried to audition for me?

01:44.404 --> 01:45.747
"Who's there?
Please don't hurt me!

01:45.839 --> 01:47.284
The safe is in my children's room."

01:47.841 --> 01:50.185
You're not getting on the show.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.814
Too bad, Hazel. Looks like
everyone's onto your crazy now.

01:53.913 --> 01:57.417
Why don't you make like
a woman driver and get lost?

01:57.517 --> 01:59.690
'Cause I'd rather make like
the father I never had and stay.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.424
Well, don't worry about me, Jenna. Hm...

02:01.521 --> 02:03.831
I've got everyone I need on my side.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.626
Who, Kenneth?

02:05.725 --> 02:08.205
The things he knows about you people.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.332
For instance, someone here
sucks on old baby wipes

02:11.431 --> 02:13.342
to get the alcohol out of them.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.844
Who does that?
That's my thing!

02:14.934 --> 02:18.575
And one of these days, Kenneth's
gonna tell me something I can use.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.344
And then I'll make my move.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.885
Well, time is running out.

02:22.175 --> 02:25.588
Tick-took, Hazel.
The clock is ticking.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.784
Well, you know what else ticks?
A time-bomb.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.761
So, yeah, Jenna, tick-took.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.197
Oh, there she is. Finally!
Liz! Where have you been?

02:38.291 --> 02:40.828
I told you, like, ten times,
I had a doctor's appointment today.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.907
My bunions are out of control.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.506
The podiatrist said
the only possible explanation

02:45.598 --> 02:47.805
is that one of my ancestors
mated with a dinosaur.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.847
Well, while you were out,
we had a little budget snafu.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.381
We can't build any new sets,

02:51.471 --> 02:53.815
so you're gonna have to completely
rewrite tomorrow's show,

02:53.907 --> 02:55.648
so that everything takes place
in a farmhouse.

02:55.742 --> 02:56.914
Pete, the budget is your job.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.383
Who are we to say what anything is?

02:59.479 --> 03:00.549
Ugh!

03:00.647 --> 03:03.184
Okay, what did you write
after Pete told you we're short?

03:03.283 --> 03:06.787
Liz, we spent a long time trying
to come up with a good excuse

03:06.886 --> 03:09.958
for why we didn't write anything,
but we failed.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.929
I put off this doctor's
appointment for months.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.705
They had to saw me out of my sneakers!

03:14.794 --> 03:16.535
And I need quadruple bunion surgery.

03:16.629 --> 03:17.471
But I can't get it

03:17.564 --> 03:19.510
because I would have to be
off my feet for three weeks.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.603
And that would require someone
else around here to actually step up!

03:23.736 --> 03:27.843
I would stomp off right now, but my
doctor says I need to walk like this:

03:29.542 --> 03:31.351
Delightful! Charlie Chaplin!

03:31.444 --> 03:32.889
You have the mustache and everything!

03:36.516 --> 03:39.690
<i>What's the matter, Jack Donaghy?
Does somebody accidentally --</i>

03:39.786 --> 03:41.629
What are you doing in here?

03:41.721 --> 03:44.224
Lemon, do you think I'm a villain?

03:44.324 --> 03:46.998
Well, I have heard you say,
"Guards, seize him!"

03:47.293 --> 03:49.500
I was at a Knicks game!
They needed to stop the clock!

03:50.563 --> 03:53.703
Why are you limping? Foot illness
or "fell running for food"?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.006
I need bunion surgery.

03:55.301 --> 03:58.578
But I can't get bunion surgery because
I have to do everything around here.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.947
No, you choose to do
everything around here.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.280
You need an assistant.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.582
What? No!
I can always use Cerie.

04:04.677 --> 04:06.281
Although the one time
I did send her on an errand,

04:06.379 --> 04:08.416
she met some guy who flew her to Paris.

04:08.514 --> 04:09.549
And then she started modeling,

04:09.649 --> 04:10.821
and then she ends it up being the reason

04:10.917 --> 04:13.864
why the French soccer team
did so badly in the 2010 World Cup.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.934
Hire someone. Someone dedicated
to making your life easier.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.433
- I don't know!
- You want to start a family?

04:19.524 --> 04:20.560
You have to prioritize.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.800
How can you take care of a child if
you can't take care of your own feet?

04:25.732 --> 04:26.836
Hey, Grizz.
Hey, Dotcom.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.574
Get me a black coffee,
by which I mean a Sunkist.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.747
How could you think
we're Grizz and Dotcom?

04:32.839 --> 04:34.648
'Cause I don't see race,
you white bastards!

04:35.375 --> 04:36.615
Tracy...

04:37.343 --> 04:39.289
...would you care to explain this?

04:40.713 --> 04:42.715
<i>What pray tel! is so funny?</i>

04:42.815 --> 04:45.853
<i>Jack Donaghy,
don't you know in this neighborhood</i>

04:45.952 --> 04:48.455
<i>you got to take your tires with you?</i>

04:49.656 --> 04:51.829
<i>Aunt Phatso, you're fired!</i>

04:51.924 --> 04:54.063
<i>You're all fired!</i>

04:55.828 --> 04:56.863
What is this?

04:56.963 --> 05:00.536
That's "Tracy Jordan's Aunt Phatso
Goes to the Hospitals Goes to Jail".

05:00.633 --> 05:01.509
When did you make a movie?

05:01.601 --> 05:02.773
Fourth of July weekend.

05:02.869 --> 05:05.748
I wrote, directed and did
all the makeup myself.

05:05.838 --> 05:06.646
Oh, it's terrible!

05:06.739 --> 05:09.948
We made 50 million dollars in Atlanta.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.920
That man is portraying me.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.048
That's Leslie van Vondervann!
He used to be on "Knots Landing".

05:14.347 --> 05:16.020
My twin is dead.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.386
Unacceptable.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.826
After all I've done for you.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.899
I brought you back from the dead
and revived your career.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.831
And this is how you thank me?

05:23.923 --> 05:27.632
<i>You'll respect me,
and you'll respect these boobies!</i>

05:30.530 --> 05:32.806
I want every DVD of this movie
removed from stores,

05:32.899 --> 05:37.109
burned, and melted into a statue
of you apologizing to me.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.007
I will do no such thing.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.846
The only statue
that movie will be turned into

05:40.940 --> 05:43.580
is an NAACP Shame Award.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.882
Hey, is there another one
of these coming out?

05:44.977 --> 05:48.424
Because I think I saw an ad for it
in "Urban Buttz" magazine.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.788
They have an excellent word jumble!

05:49.882 --> 05:50.883
The new movie is called:

05:50.983 --> 05:55.625
"Tracy Jordan's Aunt Phatso's
Jack Donaghy's We At It Again".

05:55.722 --> 05:57.360
Oh! You will not release that movie!

05:57.457 --> 05:59.869
You can't order me around.
Who do you think I am? Liz Lemon?

05:59.959 --> 06:02.872
I will not have you talk to me
like I'm some kind of Liz Lemon!

06:02.962 --> 06:04.737
Whatever.
I'll speak at both your funerals.

06:04.831 --> 06:07.402
Typical Jack Donaghy.
Giving me no respect.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.573
I'm the CEO of my own company.
I'm rich. I'm just like you!

06:11.671 --> 06:13.048
"Just like me"?
I went to Princeton.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.140
I neglected a tiger.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.078
I'm on the board
of the New York Philharmonic!

06:16.376 --> 06:19.755
I'm friends with Phil Harmonic,
the worst rapper of all time!

06:19.846 --> 06:21.621
And I'm your boss.
I own you.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.493
Think about that
during your five-night appearance

06:24.584 --> 06:25.824
on "Watch What Happens Live"!

06:25.918 --> 06:27.989
No! Andy Cohen is so catty!

06:28.087 --> 06:29.964
And that's just the beginning.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.730
If you don't take care of this,
you're fired.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.100
You're all fired!

06:37.063 --> 06:39.009
So tell me about your day, Kevin.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.099
I mean, Todd.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.040
Well, this morning, Ms. Lemon
had one of her meltdowns.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.810
Really? About what?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.408
Because she can't balance work
and personal life.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.756
But I mean, after seven years
and hundreds of these episodes,

06:51.844 --> 06:53.721
it's like, let's move on.

06:54.914 --> 06:55.949
Liz needs help.

06:56.048 --> 07:01.589
She needs someone who is ambitious
and talented and humble and a liar.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.564
That's where Hazel comes in.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.162
Let me hang those up for you.

07:08.461 --> 07:11.135
You've got better things to do,
you genius.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.034
Okay, thanks.

07:12.131 --> 07:15.135
Also, I put all the new promos
on your computer.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.178
And I wasn't sure how you take
your coffee. So, mouth or enema?

07:19.472 --> 07:20.678
What's going on here, Hazel?

07:20.773 --> 07:21.911
You need help.

07:22.008 --> 07:26.650
I know you're trying to get pregnant
because I think about it all the time.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.488
You on top, your hair whipping around.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.654
But what if you do have a kid,
and you have to leave work,

07:32.752 --> 07:35.562
because your daughter
shot her choir teacher's husband?

07:35.655 --> 07:38.158
I mean, that's the kind of stuff
my mom had to deal with.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.964
Wow. Okay, I'm just not sure
that I'm comfortable --

07:43.062 --> 07:44.564
Did you get me a second mini-fridge?

07:44.664 --> 07:47.042
No. I got you a mini-freezer.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.979
Full of candy bars so cold
they'll crack your jaw, you bitch!

07:51.070 --> 07:52.048
Shh!

07:52.138 --> 07:53.515
- I didn't say anything.
- Shh!

07:53.606 --> 07:57.918
Look, I want to help. You're my hero.
Just give me a chance.

07:58.010 --> 08:02.186
Sisters helping sisters.
Glass ceiling. Legitimate rape.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.894
Okay, Hazel.
I'm gonna get my foot surgery.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.521
And if you can be my eyes and ears
while I'm stuck on the couch,

08:07.620 --> 08:08.655
you've got the job.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.028
Great!

08:10.122 --> 08:15.162
Now, if it's okay with you,
I'm gonna go wash your sweatshirt.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.502
You got it unstuck from the chair!

08:21.734 --> 08:22.872
Good evening.

08:22.969 --> 08:25.006
The New York Philharmonic
is thrilled to announce

08:25.104 --> 08:29.018
that we've recently received a very
generous donation that will keep us

08:29.108 --> 08:31.110
fully endowed for the next decade.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.749
In honor of that gift,

08:35.847 --> 08:38.794
tonight's scheduled program
of Debussy and Rachmaninoff

08:38.885 --> 08:42.264
will be replaced with a selection
chosen by our anonymous donor.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.098
So please enjoy a four-hour rendition

08:46.192 --> 08:48.798
of the theme song from "Sanford and Son".

08:57.603 --> 08:59.913
Now who's in charge?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.685
- Here we go.
- Hazel, thank you...

09:08.781 --> 09:11.694
...for taking care of everything.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.130
I can't believe you got
my health plan to cover all this.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.827
Oh, you just need to know
what to say to them.

09:17.924 --> 09:21.098
Like their children's names
and what they wore to school today.

09:25.698 --> 09:26.733
Oh!

09:26.866 --> 09:28.140
Oh, will you send Frank in?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.043
I want to see what they wrote
to fill the fifth act.

09:30.136 --> 09:34.346
Or, since I'm here to help,
maybe I could fill the time.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.881
I still know my rhythmic
gymnastics routine.

09:36.976 --> 09:41.857
I was good, until I hit puberty and
the coach said I got too pregnant.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.825
Are you kidding?
I'm not gonna put you on the show.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.291
- Lemon, a word.
- Hey! Guy!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.624
You can't just walk in here
whenever you want!

09:50.957 --> 09:51.958
How can I help you?

09:52.058 --> 09:54.299
So, Lemon has an assistant.
Excellent.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.232
Jack Donaghy to see Liz Lemon.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.672
A Mr. Donaghy here for you.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.336
<i>Get off this channel!
This is a military frequency!</i>

10:02.635 --> 10:05.172
Okay, you can go in.

10:07.006 --> 10:10.010
So you got your surgery,
and the world hasn't ended.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.816
I think I can do this, Jack.

10:11.911 --> 10:15.324
All of it. I mean, right now
my feet are kind of like babies.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.095
I have to swaddle them,
they need ointment,

10:18.184 --> 10:21.290
and like six times a day
brown stuff comes out of them.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.258
You're beautiful, babies!
Yes, you are!

10:24.724 --> 10:27.000
Look, Lemon, I need some advice.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.801
Tracy is actually trying to fight back.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.102
He ruined a wonderful evening
at the Philharmonic,

10:32.198 --> 10:35.372
paying them to play the same song
over and over again for hours.

10:35.668 --> 10:38.740
I can't remember...
I can't remember what it was,

10:38.838 --> 10:41.409
but the point is
the man is totally irrational.

10:41.707 --> 10:44.187
You know what? Tracy's right.
You two are a lot alike.

10:44.276 --> 10:45.152
I beg your pardon?

10:45.244 --> 10:46.689
You're both stubborn.
You're rich.

10:46.779 --> 10:47.985
You think you're right all the time.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.151
You want to prove that you're not
like Tracy? Let it go.

10:50.249 --> 10:53.355
Or crush him and prove you both wrong.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.860
Get two Byrds with one Stone.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.901
Like when I used Mick Jagger
to lure Roger McGuinn

10:57.990 --> 10:59.833
and David Crosby to my birthday party!

10:59.925 --> 11:01.996
Listen to yourself!
You sound exactly like Tracy!

11:05.364 --> 11:08.743
Just the person I wanted to see!

11:08.834 --> 11:09.904
Oh, hi, Kenneth.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.173
Look, I need to tell you something.

11:14.273 --> 11:15.411
About Hazel --

11:15.708 --> 11:18.188
Oh, no, Ma'am. I don't think I should
talk to you anymore about her.

11:18.277 --> 11:21.850
You only have bad things to say,
and Hazel is my girlfriend.

11:22.381 --> 11:26.124
Kenneth, this sounds insane,
but I care about you as a friend.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.856
I take in 50 calories a day,

11:27.953 --> 11:30.160
and I'm using them all up
just trying to help you.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.032
Then, just be happy that I'm happy.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.763
You're happy because of Hazel?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.067
What could she possibly give you
that I can't?

11:37.163 --> 11:41.168
Look, I'll tell you what she gives me,
Ms. Maroney. She listens to me.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.008
Just tell me what it is!

11:43.102 --> 11:44.479
I tell her what happened during my day,

11:44.770 --> 11:47.910
and she actually wants to hear about it.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.987
Can you give me that, Ms. Maroney?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.781
I don't know.

11:54.313 --> 11:56.759
Ah, Tracy, thank you for coming.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.886
- Please, have a seat.
- No, thank you.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.863
I prefer to lie down.

12:01.954 --> 12:02.989
These are my lawyers.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.500
One is German.
One is Japanese.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.800
And you don't bring these guys
together to play patty-cake.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.099
This is war.

12:09.195 --> 12:12.039
Bad news, Jack.
"War" is my favorite card game.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.508
And I win about half the time.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.439
Here's the rub, Tracy.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.737
Because you were reckless enough

12:17.837 --> 12:19.942
to name your businessman villain
"Jack Donaghy",

12:20.039 --> 12:22.019
I can sue you for libel.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.383
I'm gonna take every penny you have.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.854
Not the ones I've swallowed.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.151
We'll see about that.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.226
Dude, it's not libel.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.420
Everything "Jack Donaghy"
does in a movie,

12:31.517 --> 12:33.019
I've seen you do in real life.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.531
Really? When did you see me
do something like this?

12:35.821 --> 12:37.767
<i>You're a menace, Aunt Phatso!</i>

12:37.857 --> 12:40.337
<i>But now that I'm on the City Council,</i>

12:40.426 --> 12:43.498
<i>I'm cancelling
your urban youth program!</i>

12:43.796 --> 12:44.797
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

12:45.998 --> 12:49.377
What? You did cancel
a program for urban youth.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.914
It was my Saturday morning kids' show,

12:52.004 --> 12:54.951
"Uncle Tracy's
Black Teletubbies Rip-off".

12:55.040 --> 12:56.110
I cancelled it because, like you,

12:56.208 --> 12:58.484
it was overly sexual
and impossible to understand.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.449
Grabalujah!

12:59.545 --> 13:03.960
Fine. I've technically cancelled
an urban children's program.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.928
But what about this assault
on my good name?

13:07.019 --> 13:09.499
<i>Not so fast, you crone!</i>

13:09.789 --> 13:12.929
<i>I bought all the wheelchair ramps
in this city.</i>

13:13.025 --> 13:16.336
<i>And I'm turning them
into more profitable stairs.</i>

13:17.163 --> 13:20.804
When have I ever verbally accosted
an old woman in a wheelchair?

13:20.900 --> 13:22.436
Liz Lemon.
Twenty minutes ago.

13:22.535 --> 13:26.244
Another technicality.
But the climax of this monstrosity...

13:26.338 --> 13:28.011
<i>Das ist vat she said!</i>

13:28.507 --> 13:31.317
...Is when "Jack Donaghy"
shuts down an orphanage.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.516
And I have never shut down an orphanage.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.021
You're right. I put that in
just to have a part in there

13:37.116 --> 13:38.220
for a little girl in my movie.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.127
I'm Willow Smith-ing my daughter.
Her album drops next week.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.388
Christmas!

13:46.091 --> 13:47.126
Blankie!

13:47.226 --> 13:49.297
That is libel, Tracy. I win.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.374
Checkmate.
Game, set, match.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.841
Rumbledy-Goo.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.946
Which is what you say
when you win in polo.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.256
Tell me about your day.
lam listening.

14:06.345 --> 14:10.623
Well, Ms. Maroney,
<i>this</i> morning, I was --

14:11.150 --> 14:12.993
<i>You're doing amazing.</i>

14:13.085 --> 14:15.929
<i>I wish you could see
how sexy your listening face is.</i>

14:16.021 --> 14:19.901
<i>For Halloween,
you should go as a slutty ear.</i>

14:19.992 --> 14:22.268
<i>What do you want to do now?
Sing?</i>

14:22.361 --> 14:24.602
<i>Yeah, let's!</i>

14:24.897 --> 14:25.967
<i># I'll be up here #</i>

14:26.065 --> 14:27.942
<i># And I'll be down here #</i>

14:28.033 --> 14:30.877
<i># Jenna's blonde as a sunrise #</i>

14:30.970 --> 14:32.574
<i># Hot as the sun #</i>

14:32.872 --> 14:36.183
<i># Bright as the shining sun #</i>

14:36.275 --> 14:37.618
But with that being said,

14:37.910 --> 14:40.618
how do you know
when you both feel the same way?

14:40.913 --> 14:41.983
I mean, sometimes I think --

14:42.281 --> 14:48.459
<i># Jenna is listening,
listening like the sun in the sky #</i>

14:49.021 --> 14:53.629
Ooh! Uh-oh, somebody needs to be changed!

14:53.926 --> 14:55.371
Need anything else, boss man?

14:55.461 --> 14:57.236
I guess just bring in the wheelchair

14:57.329 --> 14:59.309
so you can roll me down to the floor
for the show.

14:59.398 --> 15:03.642
What? No, Liz!
You had surgery this morning!

15:03.936 --> 15:05.176
Sure, but I have to be there.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.377
Oh, I would slap you if I didn't think
it would lead to a kiss.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.454
This is about priorities.

15:10.542 --> 15:15.082
What if those feet were real babies?
Would you walk on them to work?

15:15.180 --> 15:18.320
What kind of mother are you,
you beautiful monster?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.920
Hazel, I have missed one show
in seven years,

15:21.020 --> 15:22.090
and it did not go well.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.924
Josh! Help me!

15:26.558 --> 15:28.663
You're not gonna "miss the show."

15:28.961 --> 15:32.101
You're gonna watch it
on the feed, baby girl. Idiot!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.640
I'll be next to Pete the whole time.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.041
And if there's an emergency,
your wheelchair's right outside.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.648
I guess that could work.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.580
Let me be your eyes on set.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.122
Although I can never match
that amazing color.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.248
Criss calls it "Old-Timey Football".

16:02.127 --> 16:04.573
<i>Five minutes to air! Five minutes!</i>

16:04.663 --> 16:06.336
Wow. This is really working.

16:09.001 --> 16:09.706
Hey, is that me?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.342
Oh, no, that can't be --

16:16.542 --> 16:18.146
Oh, brother. That's me!

16:23.482 --> 16:25.120
It's an old show!

16:25.217 --> 16:26.059
Son of a --!

16:26.151 --> 16:27.687
Well, this e-mail is from Liz.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.161
Duh! Now, for my act,
I'm gonna need a tarp.

16:31.256 --> 16:33.759
Because the first three rows
will get wet.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.464
Why are my arms so weak?

16:38.564 --> 16:41.602
It's like I did that push-up last year
for nothing!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.577
<i>And two minutes to air!
Two minutes!</i>

16:46.538 --> 16:48.677
I'm sorry, babies.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.137
Wassername!

17:10.029 --> 17:13.806
Huh? Where am I?
Oh, Pete roofied me!

17:15.601 --> 17:18.207
Seriously, Hornberger?
You were gonna put her on the air?

17:18.303 --> 17:20.078
You told me to!
I have your e-mail!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.747
"P-Dog. Let's use Hazel in the cold open.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.545
Don't call me about this.
Catch you on the flippy-floppy."

17:25.644 --> 17:26.384
That's you!

17:26.712 --> 17:29.056
You people killed my foot babies!

17:29.148 --> 17:32.789
My foot babies died because of this show!

17:33.085 --> 17:34.086
You're fired.

17:34.186 --> 17:35.824
You can't fire me.
You don't even know my real name.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.225
Get out! Now!

17:39.458 --> 17:40.528
Oh!

17:41.460 --> 17:42.632
Ooh...

17:43.629 --> 17:45.472
Did you just fire my girlfriend?

17:45.564 --> 17:46.838
She's crazy, Kenneth!

17:47.132 --> 17:50.670
No, she's not.
Ms. Maroney knows the real Hazel.

17:50.769 --> 17:51.770
Tell them what I told you.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.518
<i>Oh, God, what do I do?
Help me, me!</i>

17:55.607 --> 17:58.645
<i>This one's on you, bitch!</i>

18:02.147 --> 18:03.717
Were you not listening?

18:03.816 --> 18:04.851
I think a song right now would --

18:05.150 --> 18:06.493
That's it!

18:06.585 --> 18:12.467
From now on, my relationship with
all of you is strictly professional.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.435
We are no longer friends.

18:14.526 --> 18:18.872
I am just a co-worker who will do
anything for any of you at any time!

18:19.164 --> 18:20.302
Nothing more!

18:20.399 --> 18:24.779
And we're live in three, two --!

18:29.775 --> 18:31.755
Oh, yeah, they didn't write anything.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.597
Tracy. This is a surprise.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.725
I thought you'd be at home
licking your wounds.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.167
No, that's why they put that cone on me.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.533
I just wanted to give you this.

18:51.363 --> 18:53.434
"You are cordially invited
to attend the premiere of

18:53.532 --> 18:57.309
'Tracy Jordan's Aunt Phatso's
Jack Donaghy's We At It Again"'.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.143
"A percentage of the film's profits

18:59.238 --> 19:01.514
will go to support
the Knuckle Beach Orphanage."

19:01.607 --> 19:02.642
I don't understand.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.847
Without that money, the orphanage
is gonna have to close.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.916
So if I shut down the movie,

19:09.214 --> 19:11.751
I actually will close down an orphanage,

19:11.850 --> 19:14.194
which means the movie isn't libellous,

19:14.286 --> 19:18.530
which means I can't shut down the movie.

19:18.624 --> 19:22.436
That's... genius.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.702
You win, Tracy.
You bested Jack Donaghy.

19:25.797 --> 19:29.870
Now you finally respect me,
and that's all I ever wanted.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.240
I really can't stop you
from portraying me

19:32.337 --> 19:33.611
as the villain in your films.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.914
What? Come on, did you not watch
the whole movie, Jackie D?

19:37.209 --> 19:38.745
Well, it's 47 minutes long.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.552
In the end, "Jack Donaghy"
is not the villain.

19:41.647 --> 19:45.618
You win, Aunt Phatso.
You bested Jack Donaghy.

19:45.717 --> 19:50.223
Now you finally respect me,
and that's all I ever wanted.

19:50.322 --> 19:53.303
Except maybe
that hot little body of yours.

19:53.392 --> 19:57.772
- Great Caesar's ghost!
- Oh, baby!

19:57.863 --> 20:01.970
Hmm. Our thing sure is
playing out just like the movie.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.649
- Oh, look, it's Liz!
- Good old Liz!

20:08.740 --> 20:12.711
Well, my feet are ruined.
The show was an embarrassment.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.313
But I learned something super fun.

20:14.413 --> 20:18.259
I will never be able to have
a family and work at "TGS".

20:18.350 --> 20:20.990
It's just not possible.
So what do I do?

20:21.286 --> 20:23.391
Don't ask me.
Tracy's the genius here.

20:23.488 --> 20:27.300
Okay, well, Tray, I'm scared.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.769
Do I give up on my dream job,

20:28.860 --> 20:30.862
something I've worked
my whole life to build?

20:30.963 --> 20:34.604
Or do I give up on my dream
of having a family?

20:34.700 --> 20:39.308
Well, as a wise woman once told me,

20:39.571 --> 20:41.744
respect these boobies!

20:46.345 --> 20:48.621
Seriously, though, what am I gonna do?
