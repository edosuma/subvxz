<i>[narrator] You're about to enter another
dimension, a dimension of time and spice.</i>

00:04.370 --> 00:08.070
<i>A dimension of overcooked
meat and bad knife cuts,</i>

00:08.070 --> 00:11.340
<i>you've crossed over into
The Bad Food Zone.</i>

00:11.340 --> 00:12.470
<i>Picture, if you will.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:13.640
[man] Now, that's a fire.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.080
All of it, it just
disintegrated.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.440
<i>[narrator] Two master chefs.</i>

00:16.450 --> 00:19.150
This is not what I thought.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.450
<i>[narrator] Anne Burrell.</i>

00:20.450 --> 00:21.850
Yeah!

00:21.850 --> 00:24.920
<i>[narrator] And newcomer,
Chef Cliff Crooks, as himself.</i>

00:24.920 --> 00:26.450
Feel like I'm living my
worst nightmare right now.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.320
Oh, damn it, it's still on.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.090
<i>[narrator] Who must transform
these poor souls from TV dinners...</i>

00:32.090 --> 00:34.030
- [Anne] Are you stirring with a fork?
- No.

00:34.030 --> 00:35.230
<i>[narrator] To kitchen winners.</i>

00:35.230 --> 00:36.930
This is delicious.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.370
[narrator]
<i>Some are total strangers.</i>

00:38.370 --> 00:40.330
-Al, Al
-These hips don't shake.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.000
[narrator]
<i>Others, old friends.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:43.440
No, no, no.
It's that one up there.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.570
<i>[narrator] But only one person
will escape with $25,000.</i>

00:47.580 --> 00:48.640
[indistinct yelling]

00:48.640 --> 00:50.280
I'm livin' my dream.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.610
<i>[narrator] A culinary
nightmare so bad.</i>

00:52.620 --> 00:54.580
- [man] Put the water in.
- [woman] Water, water, water.

00:54.580 --> 00:57.320
<i>[narrator] I can't even do
this impression anymore.</i>

00:57.320 --> 00:59.090
Ew. Salmonella everywhere.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.220
[Anne]
I am having a heart attack.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.220
<i>[narrator] Next up.</i>

01:02.220 --> 01:03.490
I'm a goblin.

01:03.490 --> 01:07.160
[narrator] Worst Cooks in
America, The Disaster Zone.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.430
[indistinct shouting]

01:09.430 --> 01:10.730
[all cheering]

01:11.470 --> 01:13.270
[man] Yeah, baby!

01:14.940 --> 01:18.110
Walking into boot camp,
there's like 25 ovens.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.370
We have... I am gagged.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.840
I am... I hope they don't gag
on my food, but I am gagged.

01:23.850 --> 01:27.980
Hello, recruits,
and welcome to boot camp.

01:27.980 --> 01:31.490
I'm Chef Anne Burrell
and joining me

01:31.490 --> 01:36.960
is a good friend of mine that's no
stranger to boot camp, Chef Cliff Crooks.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.960
[all cheering]

01:41.160 --> 01:42.360
Hi, Cliff.

01:42.360 --> 01:46.130
Cliff looks like
a drill sergeant or something.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.270
You know,
he's very intimidating.

01:48.270 --> 01:49.440
Very excited.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.270
Chef Cliff is an amazing cook.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.510
<i>He's cool. He's got the looks</i>

01:53.510 --> 01:54.910
and he's got the total package.

01:54.910 --> 01:57.380
You are all here because
you are all known

01:57.380 --> 02:00.010
for the disastrous things
you've done in the kitchen.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.750
Me? No.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.650
Raise your hand if you've
almost burned down your kitchen

02:04.650 --> 02:07.390
or actually
have burned down... Holy!

02:07.390 --> 02:08.460
Three times.

02:08.460 --> 02:09.990
Who hasn't burned down
their kitchen?

02:09.990 --> 02:11.490
I've not burnt it
all the way down.

02:11.490 --> 02:12.590
Well, thanks.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.630
- I'll see you later.
- [all laughing]

02:14.630 --> 02:16.930
[Anne] Over the course
of the next eight weeks,

02:16.930 --> 02:20.770
Cliff and I are going to whip
you guys into culinary shape.

02:20.770 --> 02:25.470
Over the years, we've had friends,
family members and even couples nominate

02:25.470 --> 02:27.070
each other for boot camp.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.610
So, some of you might
know each other.

02:29.610 --> 02:33.010
[Cliff] Now, even though some of
you know each other from home,

02:33.020 --> 02:35.420
in this kitchen,
you're all on your own.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.120
And at the end of this journey,

02:37.120 --> 02:38.750
there will only be one winner.

02:38.750 --> 02:39.950
Oh, my gosh!

02:39.960 --> 02:41.360
I'm not gonna be with you.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.960
[Cliff]
For our baseline challenge,

02:43.960 --> 02:45.590
you each will prepare
a dish that

02:45.590 --> 02:46.760
you would make for a loved one.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.100
[Anne] At the end of the cook,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.530
Cliff and I will taste
your dishes to see

02:50.530 --> 02:52.970
how much work we have to do.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.040
[Cliff] Now, recruits, you
have 60 minutes on the clock.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.000
- Are you ready?
- Yes. Yeah.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.270
- Great, because your time starts... now.
- [Anne] Now.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.880
Kara, you got to
put your apron on.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.080
Yep, apron.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.250
That's right. Thank you.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.280
Can't cook in heels.
Can't cook in heels.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.920
- How's it look?
- You look great.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.220
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

03:10.220 --> 03:12.390
- This is eating up my time.
- That's a fun start.

03:12.390 --> 03:13.950
- Now I can cook, right?
- Yes.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.220
High five! We got this.

03:16.590 --> 03:18.760
So good.
I'm here very first time.

03:18.760 --> 03:22.330
I get to co-host <i>Worst Cooks in
America, and I'm super, super stoked.</i>

03:22.330 --> 03:27.430
<i>I know Anne is the season prize
fighter to my newbie on the block,</i>

03:27.440 --> 03:28.970
but I'm gonna win.

03:30.170 --> 03:33.170
No, no, no, no, we are not
cooking in a skirt today, honey.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.780
Ooh. Yep. Okay.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.240
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.750
<i>[Anne] There it is, full Moon,
that's a first.</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:41.010
Oh!

03:41.020 --> 03:42.150
Just...

03:43.220 --> 03:44.350
Oh, my God.

03:44.350 --> 03:45.750
[Peachez] Here we go.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.960
My expectations
need to be lowered.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.330
Look at these cute
little potatoes.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.730
Oh, my, my!

03:54.730 --> 03:56.330
<i>[Anne] What these people do</i>

03:56.330 --> 03:59.970
to food always makes me shocked

03:59.970 --> 04:00.970
and I'm used to it.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.440
Little potatoes.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.010
That's what you've been
calling me for years, Marti.

04:05.010 --> 04:07.940
I'm Peachez Iman Cummings,
and I'm Marti Cummings.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.080
Oh! Oh!

04:09.080 --> 04:10.240
[Peachez] Marti, turn it off.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.150
And we're from New York City.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.350
[imitates trumpet music]

04:17.050 --> 04:18.220
I don't know what to do.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.890
Peachez and I met
one night at my show

04:20.890 --> 04:23.060
and she goes, "I do drag,"
and I said, "You know what?

04:23.060 --> 04:25.130
<i>I host an amateur
drag competition."</i>

04:25.130 --> 04:27.430
She participated. She slayed,
she became my daughter.

04:27.430 --> 04:28.530
Boom!

04:28.530 --> 04:30.500
I'm just excited to be here
with you, mama.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.930
[Marti] How long are the
potatoes supposed to potato?

04:32.940 --> 04:36.070
[Peachez] They're supposed to potato
as long as the potatoes want to potato.

04:36.070 --> 04:36.970
[Marti] Ugh...

04:36.970 --> 04:38.340
This is what pad thai made of?

04:38.340 --> 04:41.580
Cooking is this skill
that neither one of us has.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.410
- [Marti] Take a deep breath.
- [Peachez] Come on.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.310
- [Marti] Okay.
- Ooh-ho-ho!

04:47.320 --> 04:49.150
I've made a sandwich before.

04:49.150 --> 04:50.450
Same a PB and J.

04:50.450 --> 04:51.490
I can go all the way.

04:51.490 --> 04:52.750
You really can't mess that up.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.990
Okay, what is
happening here, ladies?

04:55.990 --> 04:57.120
<i>[Peachez] It's pad thai.</i>

04:57.130 --> 04:58.430
Have you ever made
pad thai before?

04:58.430 --> 04:59.990
I sure have not.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.400
But I imagine, when you taste
this, you are going to be transported.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.170
I'm going to be something.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.170
<i>[Marti] We're cooking
because we want to make sure</i>

05:07.170 --> 05:09.440
our men folk at home were
able to have a double date.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.440
[Anne] Nice.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.910
[Marti] I don't want
to catch you on fire.

05:11.910 --> 05:13.470
[Anne] I don't want
you to catch me on fire.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.740
I'm guessing there's a lot of
hair products happening here.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.380
But look it,
we could be sisters.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.010
- Honey.
- Platinum blonde girls.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.310
On tour, baby.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.120
We want to bring
something to the potluck, too.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.420
<i>[Peachez] Yes.</i>

05:23.420 --> 05:25.950
<i>We're not gonna stop
at the restaurant on the way.</i>

05:25.950 --> 05:28.760
We're gonna cook something, huh.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.990
[Marti] Little bit of pepper.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.730
No...
That feels like sabotage.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.360
I'm your mother, I'm helping.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.860
So high quality mayonnaise.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.430
Pretty excited about this.

05:37.430 --> 05:42.700
I'm going to make Hibachi Noodles
with steak and shrimp for my lovely wife.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.070
I'm Eddie Anderson
and I'm Kara Anderson.

05:45.070 --> 05:47.070
Are you gonna say the part
we're from Leitchfield, Kentucky.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.880
- We're gonna say together.
- Okay, cool.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.910
And we are high school teachers
from Leitchfield, Kentucky.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.950
-I need to first...
-[Eddie] Hey, Kara, don't mess up.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.320
Do stuff with mayonnaise.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.150
Might as well throw
you in here sugar, huh?

05:58.150 --> 06:00.420
<i>We met online.</i>

06:00.420 --> 06:03.590
<i>[Kara] Yeah, it led me to this
hunk and it was love at first sight.</i>

06:03.590 --> 06:05.490
You got some sauce in your hair.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.090
- I do?
- Yeah.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.630
I like it that way.

06:08.630 --> 06:12.000
The five and a half years that I've
been married to this man have been

06:12.000 --> 06:15.140
<i>the best dream I've ever had,
and I'm never waking up.</i>

06:15.140 --> 06:16.300
- Me either.
- [laughing]

06:16.310 --> 06:17.770
[Cliff]
Kara, what are you making?

06:17.770 --> 06:22.340
A tuna steak with, uh, mashed sweet
potatoes and squash and zucchini.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.740
- For him?
- [Kara] For my handsome...

06:23.750 --> 06:25.250
- Yeah, this is Coach Charming.
- No, I'm a chef.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.310
-Now, you're... Hey...
-[Eddie] Well, I'm working on it.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.080
- It sounded like I was bragging.
- [Kara giggling]

06:29.080 --> 06:30.580
I'm not really a sous-chef.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.190
- I don't think anybody's gonna take that seriously.
- I am not really a chef.

06:33.190 --> 06:34.960
Eddie's made a bunch of
people sick from cooking,

06:34.960 --> 06:36.390
<i>and it makes me
have to go the bathroom.</i>

06:36.390 --> 06:41.800
And he also made our neighbor
go to the hospital from cooking.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.660
[Eddie]
The inside is bright red.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.830
But she's worse than me because
she has started fires in the kitchen.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.930
[Kara] Lord!

06:47.940 --> 06:49.570
I don't even know
what to do with this thing.

06:49.570 --> 06:53.310
Our poor Harry,
his tail caught on fire.

06:53.310 --> 06:57.640
Harry is no longer
with us, by the way.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.710
<i>[Kara] That has nothing to do
with him not being with us.</i>

07:00.950 --> 07:02.950
Let's just not talk about Harry.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.950
You are my sweet potato.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.150
You're my big tuna.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.590
I am very professional
over here.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.390
Thank you. Mwah.

07:09.390 --> 07:10.760
Is it on fire?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.030
Shoot. Take this...

07:12.030 --> 07:13.530
What are you cooking?

07:13.530 --> 07:15.060
Now, who turned on that stove?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.830
How we turn that one off?

07:16.830 --> 07:18.930
Leave it alone.
Leave that alone.

07:18.930 --> 07:20.730
[producer] Which one of
you would rather go first?

07:20.740 --> 07:21.940
- Let Deneise go first.
- Me.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.540
- [producer] So if...
- Go ahead.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.110
I'm Deneise White
and I'm Hilda Ike.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.680
We are friends and we're
from Poinciana, Florida.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.080
Solivita!

07:31.910 --> 07:33.080
I am sorry.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.080
Who says they're from Solivita.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.020
City and state.

07:37.020 --> 07:41.590
<i>Solivita, it's our development where
we live and nobody knows Solivila.</i>

07:41.590 --> 07:42.760
Solapeta.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.360
You don't even know
how to say it.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.090
[Deneise]
<i>It's a 55 plus community.</i>

07:46.090 --> 07:47.290
<i>[Hilda] Absolutely.</i>

07:47.300 --> 07:49.000
We pretend to be 55.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.760
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.870
[laughing]

07:51.870 --> 07:53.370
Oh, dear God. Oh, dear God.

07:53.370 --> 07:55.770
<i>[Hilda] Are we known in our
community as being bad cooks?</i>

07:55.770 --> 07:57.300
That would be a yes.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.470
The ones who bring
the drinks and the chips.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.910
In my case, it's the apple pie.

08:01.910 --> 08:03.310
<i>But I fix it up,</i>

08:03.310 --> 08:04.980
so you'd think I made it.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.550
- I don't even know what this is.
- Whoa!

08:07.550 --> 08:10.320
I'm making swordfish
and mac and cheese.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.550
This dish is inspired
by my daughter,

08:12.550 --> 08:17.060
who loves macaroni and cheese, and
my friend and current neighbor, Hilda.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.860
Why I said current is beyond me.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.130
[laughing]

08:20.130 --> 08:21.260
Maybe she won't be later.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.760
[Deneise] I'm done.
It's going in.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.560
- Don't care.
- Wow, that looks good.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.530
- Don't care.
- No, it looks good.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.100
[Deneise]
What the heck are you making?

08:28.100 --> 08:30.370
[Hilda] I am making
curry chicken.

08:30.370 --> 08:31.610
[Deneise]
You're making something,

08:31.610 --> 08:33.010
but I don't think it's
curry chicken.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.570
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hilda? Hi, Hilda.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.780
What are you cutting?

08:35.780 --> 08:37.980
- Ghost peppers.
- What is it?

08:37.980 --> 08:39.050
- What are they?
- Ghost peppers.

08:39.050 --> 08:40.180
Ghost pepper?

08:40.180 --> 08:41.620
Oh, that's why,
that's why you're choking.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.150
- Okay, okay.
- It's good.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.180
It's good.

08:44.550 --> 08:45.950
Yeah, get it in there!

08:45.950 --> 08:49.560
Ghost peppers are
the spiciest pepper ever.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.820
All right, I'm gonna eat that.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.990
One ghost pepper
is a stick of dynamite.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.500
Two ghost peppers
is like napalm.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.930
How many are you
putting in there?

08:56.930 --> 08:58.130
- Two?
- Two.

08:58.130 --> 09:01.170
- Awesome!
- It's good stuff.

09:01.170 --> 09:06.210
I mean, I already feel like smoke
coming out of my ears, my hair on fire.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.370
- [laughing]
- They're so funny.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.010
Oh, dear.

09:09.010 --> 09:12.610
I think Hilda might actually
moonlight as some sort of hit person.

09:12.610 --> 09:14.150
She's got this maniacal laugh.

09:14.150 --> 09:16.120
[Hilda laughing]

09:16.120 --> 09:18.390
Like, she's gonna like
kill me with the chicken.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.990
[Hilda] Oh, yeah.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.190
They're gonna like.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.260
They're gonna eat this.
They're gonna like this.

09:23.260 --> 09:24.960
[laughing]

09:24.960 --> 09:26.060
[Deneise coughing]

09:26.060 --> 09:28.060
- Hilda, that pepper...
- What are you trying to do?

09:28.060 --> 09:29.230
I'm not looking to die here.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.600
I am nervous.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.430
[Hilda laughs]

09:39.470 --> 09:42.310
Recruits,
y'all have 45 minutes left.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.310
- What?
- Forty-five minutes remain.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.580
Why?

09:48.080 --> 09:49.350
Whoo!

09:50.380 --> 09:54.120
This is, this is
not what I thought.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.760
[Anne] Do you remember
when you judged the finale?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.890
Yeah, they were really good.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.590
That was a good piece of pork.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.200
[Anne] Mmm-hmm.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.400
I am shocked right now.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.360
That's good.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.170
This is where we started.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.070
Like when we say we bring in the worst
cooks of America, we're so not kidding.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.570
- Oh!
- Brown food taste good.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.170
That's right.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.570
Brown food tastes good.

10:14.580 --> 10:15.980
[AL] Brown food tastes good.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.340
[Anne] Words to live by.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.350
Oh, you're a real fan.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.350
[AL] I am.

10:20.350 --> 10:23.450
My name is Al
and I'm from Tony, Wisconsin.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.120
Um, do I fry these
or boil these?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.950
I can't help you.
I don't know.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.490
If I had to rate my culinary
skills from 1 to 10.

10:30.490 --> 10:33.460
<i>I'd be like a negative
five something.</i>

10:33.460 --> 10:35.460
A couple of years ago,
I tried to make lasagne

10:35.460 --> 10:39.100
for my wife, started a small
fire in oven, it shattered.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.230
<i>It was just a mess.</i>

10:40.240 --> 10:42.500
I had to buy her new stove
for Mother's Day.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.040
It cost me way more money. I
should've just ordered takeout.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.170
That's nasty.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.270
<i>Do I got to cook all this?</i>

10:48.280 --> 10:49.340
With my wife being retired?

10:49.340 --> 10:52.550
<i>I want to actually
cook with and for her.</i>

10:52.550 --> 10:57.480
- Al, what are you making?
- Cajun Alfredo with andouille sausage and shrimp.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.190
Hmm. Sounds good.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.890
I'm doing miso soup and hibachi.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.460
- [Al] Miso?
- [Melody] Miso.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.390
- [Al] Miso. Never heard of it.
- It's a Asian cuisine.

11:04.390 --> 11:07.530
I always said I was too pretty to
be in the kitchen, and here I am.

11:07.530 --> 11:09.730
I'm Melody
and I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.

11:09.730 --> 11:11.360
[Al] So what all goes
into your miso soup?

11:11.370 --> 11:12.930
- [Melody] Miso.
- [Al] What's miso?

11:12.930 --> 11:14.200
Honestly, I don't know.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.400
I feel like you're slowing
me down.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.500
Oh.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.270
How can you cook
with those nails anyway?

11:18.270 --> 11:19.670
- I make it work.
- What?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.310
<i>[Melody] I can do
everything with them.</i>

11:21.310 --> 11:22.510
Those are like deadly weapons.

11:22.510 --> 11:23.810
[Melody]
Don't you want to find out.

11:23.810 --> 11:24.880
[Al chuckles] No.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.420
My ultimate goal in
cooking is to gain a man.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.220
I'm attracted to bigger
guys and they love to eat,

11:31.220 --> 11:33.920
so I need to learn how to
cook to lock one down.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.490
I'm so scared of fire, Al.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.890
I had a fire in my second
apartment.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.590
I left some rice on the stove.

11:39.590 --> 11:41.060
I jumped in the shower,

11:41.060 --> 11:42.930
<i>when I came out,
there was a fire.</i>

11:42.930 --> 11:44.530
<i>It was like so scary.</i>

11:44.530 --> 11:48.070
Thank God I had a man there
to protect me and save my life,

11:48.070 --> 11:50.740
<i>because, I mean, my
apartment was burning down.</i>

11:50.740 --> 11:53.910
Oh, my God. This is really
good weave here in my head,

11:53.910 --> 11:55.210
Just watch that, okay?

11:55.210 --> 11:56.910
[chuckles] Jeez.

11:56.910 --> 12:00.380
Plantains, it's a typical,

12:00.380 --> 12:02.180
you know, meal at my home.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.350
I'm Hector.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.720
I'm originally from
the Dominican Republic.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.290
<i>I'm making some mofongo.</i>

12:07.290 --> 12:10.460
I don't know, in my mind, I
picture this a little bit easier.

12:10.460 --> 12:13.730
Mothers in my culture, they don't
let us do pretty much anything.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.230
I got to do this, right?

12:15.230 --> 12:17.260
[Hector speaking]

12:18.430 --> 12:21.000
Actually, I want people
to know that I am

12:21.000 --> 12:24.240
my mother's favorite son,
so I never cook.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.810
[Hector] My culture is gonna
disgrace me for messing up this dish.

12:27.810 --> 12:30.380
You know, they're gonna
ban me from eating it as well.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.980
Being here with my wife,
it's good because, you know,

12:32.980 --> 12:35.350
you have somebody
worse than you.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.050
[Bianca] How do
I know if it's boiling?

12:38.050 --> 12:40.290
<i>I'm humble enough to admit
that Bianca is the worst.</i>

12:40.290 --> 12:42.120
- [chuckles]
- You're humble enough.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.430
She's better than me
at being worse cooking.

12:45.430 --> 12:46.530
That's being humble.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.030
Yes.
You know, you're the best.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.960
How can I open this?

12:51.730 --> 12:53.130
Oh, there we go.

12:53.200 --> 12:57.640
My name is Bianca and I was born
and raised in New York City. Ooh-ooh!

12:57.640 --> 13:00.310
<i>I am making rice,
beans and fried chicken.</i>

13:00.310 --> 13:02.440
Oh, shoot! My chicken.
Oh, my God.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.780
<i>[Hector] Why is Bianca
the worst cook?</i>

13:04.780 --> 13:07.980
Fire, fire, burn.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.920
And I always keep
this with me at all times

13:10.920 --> 13:13.920
when I'm with Bianca,
everywhere.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.260
<i>Like right now, there's
no stove, but just in case,</i>

13:16.260 --> 13:17.290
I have this weapon.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.990
He has 911 on speed dial.

13:18.990 --> 13:21.090
[Hector] You wanna call
your mom and ask her, right?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.230
[Bianca] I wish.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.200
The reason why we haven't
learned how to cook

13:24.200 --> 13:25.570
<i>is because
my mom is always there.</i>

13:25.570 --> 13:26.670
<i>[Hector] Feeding us.</i>

13:26.670 --> 13:28.130
[Bianca]
<i>And that's why we're here.</i>

13:28.940 --> 13:30.170
[laughing]

13:30.240 --> 13:32.940
[Hector] Mommy, I know
you're watching this. I'm sorry.

13:32.940 --> 13:34.640
Cutting up the spinach.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.180
How does nanny cook our
catfish with flour or with pink...

13:38.180 --> 13:40.580
Um... Like, I was outside
chilling with a cup of lemonade.

13:40.580 --> 13:41.780
I have no idea.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.820
Well, ew, it's touching me, ew.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.120
I'm Cheyenne Loomis
and I'm from London, Kentucky.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.420
<i>[Angie] I'm Angie Hartford, and
I'm from San Jose, California.</i>

13:49.420 --> 13:51.830
- And we're long lost cousins.
- And we're lost cousins.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.190
- You are...
- [laughing]

13:53.200 --> 13:56.260
- Oh, that was you. I said "long lost cousins."
- What was that?

13:56.260 --> 13:58.400
[Cheyenne] What else
does nanny put in here?

13:58.400 --> 14:00.030
I went on a DNA test
site, found out that

14:00.040 --> 14:02.470
I have long lost cousins
that are all from Kentucky.

14:02.470 --> 14:05.340
<i>Ever since then, Cheyenne
and I have been pretty tight.</i>

14:05.340 --> 14:06.970
It was like instant
chemistry with us.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.170
- Yes, it was.
- Yeah, it was.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.210
Is catfish one of those
you're supposed to cook

14:10.210 --> 14:13.050
like salmon fats
or catfish cook all the way.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.450
- No idea.
- Uh...

14:14.450 --> 14:16.080
[Cheyenne] You do you.
I think you got this.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.020
Angie and I both bonded over
the fact that we cannot cook.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.120
[Angie] <i>I think Cheyenne's
biggest problem in the kitchen</i>

14:21.120 --> 14:22.360
is she acts like
she only has one arm.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.560
[laughing]

14:23.560 --> 14:26.330
<i>She doesn't touch anything
with both arms.</i>

14:26.330 --> 14:29.600
She just forgets
that she has two hands.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.530
[Cheyenne] I'm making a cucumber that
I'm gonna mix with the Jo-chujang sauce.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.970
[Angie] It's called Gochujang.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.070
Get it right.

14:36.070 --> 14:37.600
What?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.040
- What, Cliff? What?
- [Cliff] Oh, my!

14:39.040 --> 14:40.370
- [Anne] The knife cut...
- [Cliff] Yeah.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.780
Yes, I know.
This always is very scary.

14:42.780 --> 14:44.780
All right. I'm gonna start to
take a walk around.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.010
Good luck with that.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.750
Anne tried to warn me
how bad they were gonna be.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.350
And, you know, I laughed it off.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.150
Like, of course,
they're not gonna be great.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.750
<i>She was 100% right. It is...</i>

14:54.760 --> 14:56.260
wow!

14:56.260 --> 14:57.260
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.560
[Angie]
How are you, Chef Anne?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.390
- [Anne] What are you making?
- I'm making mashed potatoes.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.100
What else you're making?

15:02.100 --> 15:05.160
Fried catfish and fried okra, because
I wanted that, I've never had catfish.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.130
There you go.

15:06.130 --> 15:07.100
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.130
What are you making?

15:08.140 --> 15:10.240
Bibidibap. Bimbibap.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.940
- [Anne] Bibimbap.
- [Cheyenne] Bibim-Bibimbap.

15:11.940 --> 15:14.410
It starts to make me
a little bit scared

15:14.410 --> 15:17.580
<i>when Cheyenne doesn't even
really know how to pronounce it.</i>

15:17.580 --> 15:19.750
[Angie] And that's my
background, Korean.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.010
I love Korean food.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.180
[Angie]
Oh. Not after she cooks it.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.350
She'll eat her own food.

15:23.350 --> 15:25.220
- No one else will.
- No.

15:25.220 --> 15:28.420
And now I'm like roasting
my carrots and my garlic,

15:28.420 --> 15:29.560
and I made rice.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.290
Oh, so it's a vegetarian dish?

15:31.990 --> 15:34.360
No, I forgot about the meats.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.600
- Oh.
- [laughing]

15:36.600 --> 15:39.130
How do you forget your
meat? It's a Bibimbap.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.470
There's only 30 minutes.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.140
[Cheyenne] What is happening?

15:47.680 --> 15:50.240
There's only 30 minutes.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.980
Thirty minutes.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.050
It's just amazing standing
up here, things smell like food,

15:56.050 --> 15:57.620
but there's no actually,
but there's no food.

15:57.620 --> 15:58.950
[Deneise] Put some salt in it.

15:58.950 --> 16:00.190
That's what they do on the show.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.420
[both laughing]

16:02.420 --> 16:03.960
Like, like this.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.430
[Cliff] Oh, my God,
what have I done?

16:05.430 --> 16:07.230
- What is happening?
- What is that called?

16:07.230 --> 16:08.760
- A wok.
- A what?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.930
A wok. I'm making stir fry.

16:10.930 --> 16:12.100
What do you mean a wok?

16:12.100 --> 16:14.570
A wok. I think it's W-O-K.

16:14.570 --> 16:15.740
[Al] Are you serious?

16:15.740 --> 16:17.370
I don't know.
I'm a truck driver.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.270
<i>Okay, I'll take
your word for it.</i>

16:19.270 --> 16:21.980
I don't know [bleep]
about cooking, so don't ask.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.080
[laughing]

16:23.080 --> 16:25.180
- [Melody] How are you?
- I am-I am great.

16:25.180 --> 16:28.180
Look, I look crazy, so
don't look at me in the face.

16:28.180 --> 16:29.180
Cliff...

16:29.180 --> 16:30.750
Hot man.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.520
I don't know this man, but he's
a handsome chocolate drop.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.160
I'm sweating and it's hot
and you're really attractive.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.160
It's okay. It's, it's hot...

16:39.160 --> 16:41.560
[Cliff] What are you making? What
is the stir -fry you put in together?

16:41.560 --> 16:44.560
It's a cauliflower rice
vegetable stir-fry.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.870
[Cliff] Oh, cool.

16:45.870 --> 16:47.730
- How does it look? Yeah.
- [Cliff] It looks great. Yeah.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.100
- Good.
- It really looks great.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.370
I came in here to find a man
and I think I just found one.

16:52.370 --> 16:54.310
- Oh, God, he's fine.
- Okay.

16:54.310 --> 16:55.540
So, meat.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.380
My mofongo has pork.

16:57.380 --> 16:58.780
You gotta slap it a little bit.

16:58.780 --> 17:00.450
<i>And if you slap the belly,
you know,</i>

17:00.450 --> 17:02.120
that seasoning will go in there.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.180
Sort of kinky, right?

17:03.180 --> 17:04.450
[Bianca] Just shut up.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.020
[Hector] No? I'm a sexy man.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.020
I'm a sexy man.
What can I say?

17:08.020 --> 17:09.760
<i>- Yes, irresistible.
- Thank you.</i>

17:10.620 --> 17:12.160
- Hi, chef.
- [Cliff] What are you making?

17:12.160 --> 17:14.460
Rice, beans and fried chicken.

17:14.460 --> 17:16.130
But the beans tastes like dirt.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.200
I'll tell you right now.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.300
They taste nasty.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.400
Well, well, I-I don't...

17:20.400 --> 17:22.470
I don't know
what to do to fix it but...

17:22.470 --> 17:24.370
I don't know a recipe
that contains "dirt".

17:24.370 --> 17:25.910
I'll let Anne take that recruit.

17:25.910 --> 17:28.110
- Hot boiling water coming through.
- [Cliff] Everybody, look out.

17:28.110 --> 17:29.440
Coming through,
announce yourself.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.640
Hot stuff.
Yell it, yell it, yell it.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.150
Hey, watch out.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.580
I've got water and it's hot.

17:33.580 --> 17:37.920
Kara and Eddie, they certainly
are very married.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.550
It's hard to focus with you...

17:39.550 --> 17:41.020
- I know.
- In here.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.520
You're beautiful.
You can flirt with me.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.020
- Okay.
- Hey.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.630
Yes.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.860
It's just water.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.630
Oh-ho-ho. Snap.

17:49.630 --> 17:52.030
Oh, no, it's your eye.

17:53.270 --> 17:54.870
- I'm sorry.
- Sour cream?

17:54.870 --> 17:56.070
Okay.

17:56.070 --> 17:58.240
I think we're gonna need
to separate them.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.370
You like that sizzle, right?

17:59.370 --> 18:00.470
I love the sizzle.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.010
- Right?
- That actually sounds...

18:02.010 --> 18:04.340
She sizzles every day
and I get to watch her

18:04.350 --> 18:06.250
every day just sizzle
around the house.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.910
Look at that. All right.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.080
Um...

18:09.080 --> 18:10.750
- Inspirational, you two are.
- It's... Yes.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.520
But I'm still gonna
try to beat him.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.020
Yeah?

18:14.020 --> 18:15.350
Duh?

18:15.360 --> 18:16.490
Oh, great day, the noodles.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.290
It would mean a lot to
me to learn how to cook.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.030
[Hilda] <i>Yeah, your
daughter would appreciate it.</i>

18:20.030 --> 18:21.890
And my daughter
would appreciate it.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.030
The poor child hasn't had
a decent meal in 21 years.

18:25.030 --> 18:26.500
Okay, if you had to
go there. Anyway...

18:26.500 --> 18:28.130
[Hilda] Isn't this beautiful?

18:28.140 --> 18:29.470
[Deneise] That's a hot mess.

18:29.470 --> 18:31.140
Hilda's cooking is so bad.

18:31.140 --> 18:33.170
Her dog wouldn't
even eat her food.

18:33.170 --> 18:34.740
<i>She put down a barbecue chicken,</i>

18:34.740 --> 18:35.940
they just walked away.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.440
- Hi, there.
- Hello, Anne.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.580
- Chef Anne.
- Chef Anne.

18:39.580 --> 18:45.350
I would love to make Chef Anne
proud, but Chef Cliff, hmm... Sorry.

18:45.350 --> 18:47.020
[laughing]

18:47.020 --> 18:49.120
Okay, what do we have?
You are encroaching.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.820
You were, you were, you
were like boxing her out.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.060
She can't get it.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.360
She can't get into your station.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.030
Put him on a plate, glazed
him right up... Okay, sorry.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.730
So I know there's mac
and cheese on this menu.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.140
[Deneise] And swordfish.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.500
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.600
Okay. All right.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.840
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.010
Do, do you. You do you.

19:08.010 --> 19:09.480
- Yes.
- You could always start over.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.280
- Start over?
- [Hilda] Do you want me to start over?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.250
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.580
- How's mine?
- I was talking to her.

19:13.580 --> 19:16.950
You continue down
the path that you're going.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.120
All right.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.790
It's gonna be some good cooking.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.250
[groaning]

19:21.260 --> 19:25.860
Peachez, is catfish supposed to
be cooked fast like salmon or not?

19:25.860 --> 19:27.190
- I...
- You've had it before.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.030
- Is it one of those...
- I've eaten it, I haven't cooked it.

19:29.030 --> 19:30.900
- I don't know.
- Oh, God, you're useless.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.530
[Peachez] That's rude.

19:32.530 --> 19:36.100
I've never cooked catfish before, and I
have no idea why Cheyenne loves catfish.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.970
Ugh. Ugh.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.440
I mean, naturally,
that fish is disgusting.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.310
[Cheyenne] That doesn't look
like catfish I've eaten.

19:42.310 --> 19:44.210
This catfish is killing me.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.340
Ew, what is that?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.880
Does this look normal to you?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.380
Does this look,
does this look normal to you?

19:48.380 --> 19:49.450
What it is, a cyst?

19:49.450 --> 19:51.280
What are you...
what are you asking me?

19:51.290 --> 19:53.750
The catfish, like, is it
supposed to be brown like that?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.420
- Yes, it is.
- Okay. Good to know that.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.990
- Thank you.
- It's not an alien.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.420
- All right. Good.
- It's not alien.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.390
[in mechanical voice] <i>That's
what we want you to think.</i>

20:00.400 --> 20:02.600
My catfish is just ugly.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.400
It's horrible.
I need you to taste this.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.330
Is that what it tastes like?

20:07.340 --> 20:08.530
It's very bland.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.540
It is not looking like
how my grandma makes it.

20:10.540 --> 20:11.740
[Cheyenne] That's not good.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.040
Well,
it doesn't look good either.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.110
If it's not cooked, I'm cooked.

20:15.110 --> 20:16.310
- [chokes]
- No.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.080
No, it is not cooked.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.280
- [Cheyenne] Ah!
- No.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.110
- Oh, my God.
- How are you doing?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.320
So, you're all relaxed? You're
all, you're all, like, ready?

20:23.320 --> 20:24.920
- You're... hot.
- [Cliff] What are we making?

20:24.920 --> 20:27.620
I am making pad thai.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.320
This looks like pad thai, right?

20:29.320 --> 20:30.320
Ye-yeah.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.390
No.

20:31.390 --> 20:32.990
You're going to be
knocked off your feet.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.490
That's a good... I...

20:36.600 --> 20:38.100
I am speechless.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.430
<i>I'm gonna eat it, too.</i>

20:39.430 --> 20:41.270
- [Marti] Are you allowed to try it now or no?
- [Peachez] No.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.140
- No, no.
- That is cheating.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.340
I'm just so nervous because I literally
almost killed my entire family once cooking.

20:45.340 --> 20:47.370
<i>I went home to visit my parents.</i>

20:47.380 --> 20:50.080
My aunt brought over a bag of ghost peppers
and I was like, "I got this, I'm gonna cook."

20:50.080 --> 20:51.480
<i>The smoke was so bad</i>

20:51.480 --> 20:53.980
<i>with the heat from the peppers,
even the baby was choking.</i>

20:53.980 --> 20:56.120
<i>My parents don't let me in
the kitchen at all anymore.</i>

20:56.120 --> 20:59.550
Okay. I don't know. I don't know if
that, made me feel better, but yes.

20:59.550 --> 21:03.260
Um, I definitely have my work cut
out for me with this batch of recruits.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.890
- [Marti] Ow!
- [Peachez] Be careful, please.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.090
-It was just my nail. It's okay.
-Okay.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.860
I guess
I was a little delusional

21:07.860 --> 21:10.130
<i>and I thought it was
gonna be better than it was.</i>

21:10.130 --> 21:12.530
Um, I was wrong. I was wrong.

21:12.530 --> 21:15.230
I'm actually very impressed
with the steak.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.170
Ow! Ow! Ow!

21:17.170 --> 21:18.840
[Cheyenne laughing]

21:18.840 --> 21:22.170
I flip-miss meat
and all of a sudden,

21:22.180 --> 21:26.880
literally, whoo,
flames in my eyelashes.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.010
<i>Peachez was gonna catch a fire.</i>

21:28.020 --> 21:29.250
I'm gonna catch on fire.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.980
Stop catching on fire.
Stop catching on fire.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.420
These flames are huge.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.120
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.860
I'm trying to get it off
the damn grill.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.460
[Peachez] Where are you
going to put it, though?

21:38.460 --> 21:40.660
Oh the not-grill,
on a, on a plate.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.060
We might not make it out.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.600
Oh, my God.

21:58.580 --> 22:01.310
Recruits, you have
15 minutes left.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.480
Oh, my gosh.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.880
Yes, 15 minutes.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.120
Oh, my God.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.520
Marti is having a hot flash.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.890
Hey, get out, get out.

22:09.890 --> 22:12.120
If that's not done, honey,
I don't know what is.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.960
[laughing]

22:15.430 --> 22:17.360
- Oh, you know what?
- Please watch your body.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.630
Fan it, fan it.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.300
No that... that
makes fire come.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.570
Okay.

22:21.570 --> 22:23.540
It smells not great.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.040
You burnt
the hell out of that pan.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.080
Well, the food is good, though.

22:30.310 --> 22:32.180
I've got some fish over here.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.780
<i>I'm making tuna for my big tuna.</i>

22:34.780 --> 22:37.180
I love tuna steaks,

22:37.190 --> 22:40.420
but there's not a chance that
it's gonna turn out good.

22:40.420 --> 22:43.460
Give it a little spank,
spanky, spank.

22:43.460 --> 22:46.330
The dangle whip
is what I like to call this.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.190
Dangle whip.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.360
Here we go. Just... okay.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.670
Dangle it and whip it.

22:53.670 --> 22:55.740
[laughs]

22:55.740 --> 22:57.300
[sighs]

22:57.310 --> 22:59.140
Kara, the tuna
is not your husband.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.310
- [Anne] Right.
- Oh, well.

23:01.310 --> 23:03.210
You know, I can't do
that to him right now, so.

23:03.210 --> 23:04.410
Yeah, I know, right?

23:04.410 --> 23:05.950
- I know, but...
- Okay.

23:05.950 --> 23:08.050
I have a feeling
what you're gonna do later.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.420
He's ready, so... All right.

23:10.420 --> 23:14.950
So this is my challenge because
I don't have a traditional pilon.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.260
My mother's recipe says I need
a mortar and a pestle, a pilon.

23:18.260 --> 23:19.490
I need a pilon.

23:19.490 --> 23:23.660
You can use, um,
a stick to smash it.

23:23.660 --> 23:25.400
I gotta improvise.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.030
Let's see.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.100
Let's see
what's gonna happen now, babe.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.040
Yeah, this is better.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.470
You can call me Roberto Flay.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.710
Cliff is gonna offer me
a job after he tastes that.

23:39.510 --> 23:40.680
Are you ready for this?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.280
Clear the way, Eddie.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.750
Oh!

23:44.550 --> 23:45.790
[screams]

23:45.790 --> 23:47.090
Oh, my goodness.

23:47.090 --> 23:49.490
- Pirouette's happening?
- What is happening?

23:49.490 --> 23:51.490
I'm feeling my oats...

23:51.490 --> 23:53.060
Roll it out. Let me see it.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.470
Mazel.

24:01.470 --> 24:03.140
How'd your miso turn out?

24:03.140 --> 24:04.340
It tastes good.

24:04.340 --> 24:05.570
Oh, you tasted your food?

24:05.570 --> 24:06.870
Yeah, I did.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.110
[Al] I'm scared to taste mine.

24:08.110 --> 24:09.380
[Melody] Can I taste it?

24:09.380 --> 24:10.880
[Al] Yeah, you can taste
out of that pan.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.280
Wow, you're really gutsy.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.310
Trash cans right there.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.550
It's not bad.

24:15.550 --> 24:16.780
[Al] Really?

24:16.780 --> 24:17.980
A little gummy.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.150
[laughing]

24:19.150 --> 24:20.450
Thirty seconds.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.490
I'm done.

24:21.490 --> 24:22.420
Yeah!

24:22.420 --> 24:23.590
[Peachez] This is gorgeous.

24:23.590 --> 24:26.530
Honestly, cooking is easy.

24:26.530 --> 24:31.700
[Anne and Cliff]
Five, four, three, two, one.

24:32.230 --> 24:34.270
Oh, my gosh.

24:34.870 --> 24:35.940
[exhales]

24:35.940 --> 24:38.070
And we didn't burn
the place down.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.140
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.970
- We did it.
- Wait.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.110
There's something,
there's a fly.

24:43.110 --> 24:44.410
Get out of here.

24:44.410 --> 24:45.510
At least they like it.

24:45.510 --> 24:47.450
Ooo-kay.

24:47.450 --> 24:48.950
- Oh.
- All right.

24:48.950 --> 24:50.350
Out first cook is done.

24:50.350 --> 24:52.820
I'm so excited to see
what they've made.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.150
Cheers.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.820
I hope you're
my friend after this.

24:55.820 --> 24:58.660
Oh, man, there
are so many things.

25:01.460 --> 25:04.200
It's time to taste all of
your interesting dishes.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.870
- Angie?
- My turn.

25:05.870 --> 25:07.300
Come on down.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.800
Catfish, I recognize you.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.070
- And cottage cheese.
- Mm-hm-hmm.

25:10.070 --> 25:13.510
[Angie] I made deep fried
catfish and okra, mashed potatoes

25:13.510 --> 25:16.240
and obviously, the cottage
cheese as you pointed out.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.410
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

25:17.410 --> 25:18.580
[coughs]

25:18.580 --> 25:22.080
I need a little palette
cleanser of cottage cheese.

25:23.220 --> 25:24.620
This is just not my day.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.090
The fish is way overcooked.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.990
It's so dry.

25:31.020 --> 25:33.430
- You need work on your seasoning.
- Okay.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.960
[Anne] Cheyenne, come on up.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.270
That is Bibimbap, a Korean
dish inspired by Angie.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.270
We've met. Hi, Angie.

25:42.270 --> 25:44.870
- Have you eaten this dish before?
- No.

25:44.870 --> 25:47.170
- You've never even tasted Bibimbap?
- No.

25:47.170 --> 25:50.480
The first time I heard Bibimbap,
I was like, "Is that a band?"

25:50.480 --> 25:52.010
[Cliff] You only cut
with one hand.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.780
This hand doesn't
have any action,

25:53.780 --> 25:54.950
and this one is doing
all the work.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.880
It was like a machete.

25:56.880 --> 26:01.150
It's like you're going through the
jungle. It actually looks fairly neat.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.460
There's just no seasoning
here whatsoever.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.690
Eddie, come on up.

26:06.690 --> 26:10.060
My dish looks pretty similar to what
Kara gets at the Hibachi restaurant.

26:10.060 --> 26:14.730
I made Hibachi steak and shrimp
with yum sauce and Asian noodles.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.170
[Cliff] Why do we call
it yum sauce?

26:16.170 --> 26:18.070
I, honestly, I don't know.

26:18.340 --> 26:19.570
It's good.

26:19.570 --> 26:22.170
I don't know if I'm gonna
agree about the yum sauce.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.440
[Cliff] Hmm. No, the noodles
are undercooked.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.950
- [Cliff] Kara?
- Oh.

26:26.950 --> 26:31.120
<i>I made grilled Tuna steak,
mashed sweet potatoes</i>

26:31.120 --> 26:35.250
<i>and squash and zucchini
with a special garlic aioli sauce.</i>

26:35.260 --> 26:37.990
Oh, wow.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.160
- So, salty.
- Oh man.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.430
Crap!

26:41.430 --> 26:42.490
Oh, my.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.760
Oh, shoot.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.460
<i>This is the very
first challenge.</i>

26:45.470 --> 26:48.130
I don't want them to
think I'm a train-wreck.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.470
Okay.

26:52.470 --> 26:53.610
I'm scared to death.

26:53.610 --> 26:55.310
[Anne] Where to start?
Where to start?

26:55.310 --> 26:56.380
Here we go.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.340
Um... Hmm...

27:04.050 --> 27:06.050
Okay, I'll start
with the positives.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.250
Okay.

27:07.250 --> 27:11.490
Miraculously,
your tuna is cooked nicely.

27:12.060 --> 27:13.290
It's a miracle.

27:13.290 --> 27:14.760
You have no idea
how you did that.

27:14.760 --> 27:19.400
That's why I'm saying miraculously.
Your zucchini and summer squash,

27:19.400 --> 27:24.740
they are wildly over seasoned
like, ahh, burning my mouth with salt.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.170
So there we go.

27:26.170 --> 27:31.080
Overall, my dish was better
than I thought it was gonna be.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.880
Marti, come on up.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.080
Oh.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.420
Okay, it's just gonna
take me a minute.

27:36.420 --> 27:38.520
- These shoes are very high.
- [Cliff] It's okay. Strut it.

27:38.520 --> 27:43.490
I'm thinking, please,
please, please let this steak

27:43.490 --> 27:45.420
<i>be remotely edible.</i>

27:45.430 --> 27:47.190
It doesn't have to be fully
edible, just a little.

27:47.190 --> 27:48.790
That's, that's meat.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.930
And I tried to make mashed
potatoes, but they wouldn't mash,

27:51.930 --> 27:55.470
so we put them in the thingy,
the thing that, you know...

27:55.470 --> 27:56.670
Krrr...

27:57.440 --> 27:58.970
Just enjoy. Get in there.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.640
Don't eat the sauce though,
it's not good.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.570
Your asparagus is nicely cooked.

28:02.580 --> 28:03.780
Got one.

28:03.780 --> 28:06.750
[Anne] It's caked in pepper.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.750
Oh, wipe it.
Get your napkin, just wipe it.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.220
What did you season
the steak with?

28:10.220 --> 28:11.780
- Oh, my God, I can't...
- Oh, I forgot to.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.450
I don't know what I would
even seasoned it with.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.390
Salt is a good start.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.290
You know, it could be prettier.

28:17.290 --> 28:18.520
I've heard that many times.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.860
[laughing]

28:20.860 --> 28:23.600
I'm guessing that
appearance is important...

28:23.600 --> 28:25.000
- [Marti] Yes.
- To you.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.600
It is important here, too.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.600
Peachez to the podium.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.740
All-righty!

28:30.740 --> 28:32.140
- [Cliff chuckles]
- Wow.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.410
Peachez, tell us what you made?

28:37.410 --> 28:42.280
Veggie and tofu pad thai,
green papaya salad

28:42.280 --> 28:46.020
and then sticky rice and mango.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.120
[Cliff] Is that just
the whole piece of garlic?

28:48.120 --> 28:49.560
Careful, there is garlic.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.890
They're like booby traps.

28:52.890 --> 28:56.100
Or they're, like,
exciting, heart health!

28:56.100 --> 28:57.200
Oh, no.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.400
- No.
- [Cliff] No.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.630
Ah.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.370
I'm gonna throw
it right out there.

29:03.370 --> 29:05.440
It's really a good
idea to cook the rice.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.970
Just enjoy
the mango if you want.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.980
[Anne] Hector, come on up.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.780
Good luck.

29:12.850 --> 29:16.820
I made some traditional
mofongo chicharron pork belly.

29:16.820 --> 29:20.350
Oh, my God, I can't even stick my
fork in the chicharron to pick it up.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.250
Just got to put
a little force into it.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.520
How many times have
you made mofongo?

29:23.520 --> 29:24.960
This is my first time.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.230
I usually just eat the food.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.230
The pork isn't cooked.

29:28.230 --> 29:31.060
I have a piece of
plantain stuck in my throat.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.230
[Cliff] I love mofongo.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.630
This is not mofongo.

29:33.630 --> 29:35.130
- Uh...
- [Cliff] Okay.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.940
[Anne] Bianca, come on up.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.200
- [Anne] Hello.
- [Bianca] Hi.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.440
[Cliff] Hi, Bianca.

29:39.440 --> 29:44.080
I made white rice,
beans and fried chicken.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.910
[Anne] Your beans are super yum.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.850
- Really?
- [Anne] Uh-huh.

29:47.850 --> 29:50.420
- The chicken is breaded beautifully.
- Oh!

29:50.420 --> 29:52.920
My piece of chicken
might be a hair pink.

29:52.920 --> 29:56.720
I will say the outside
of the chicken is delicious.

29:56.720 --> 30:01.230
Your rice is undercooked, but
there's a lot of good things on this plate.

30:01.230 --> 30:03.460
I'll be honest with you because
I'm humble, it looked good.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.660
It looked okay.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.130
Bianca wins, hashtag.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.040
[Cliff] Melody?

30:10.040 --> 30:13.570
That's Melody stir-fry
and miso soup.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.610
- Give it to me.
- Pepper-er-r.

30:17.610 --> 30:20.450
Well, I realized I didn't
put any seasoning in it

30:20.450 --> 30:24.080
when I was cooking it, so I threw
some pepper on it right at the end.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.080
[Melody] Little spicy?

30:25.090 --> 30:27.150
I mean...

30:27.150 --> 30:30.420
Pepper is not like
a finishing thing, everybody.

30:30.420 --> 30:33.060
Water and miso does
not miso soup make.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.130
It looks like miso soup.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.860
I'm gonna be
a little optimistic here

30:36.860 --> 30:38.530
and just throw
out some positive comments.

30:38.530 --> 30:40.470
I believe in positive energy.

30:41.470 --> 30:43.370
- Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
- Sure.

30:45.610 --> 30:46.740
Al.

30:46.740 --> 30:47.940
Hi, guys.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.040
- Hey, Al.
- Hello.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.310
[Al] It's a Cajun Alfredo.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.520
This sauce itself is
very, very, very fatty.

30:56.520 --> 31:00.390
The flavor of the Cajun
seasoning is, is actually good.

31:00.390 --> 31:02.690
-You did that well. It's just...
-Overcooked.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.190
[Anne] It's... Everything
is overcooked.

31:04.190 --> 31:05.390
Duh.

31:05.390 --> 31:08.130
It was a miracle that
the sauce was even white.

31:08.130 --> 31:10.230
[laughing]

31:10.230 --> 31:11.730
- Thank you, Al.
- Thank you.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.040
Hilda, come on up.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.810
Oh, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.

31:19.810 --> 31:23.940
[Hilda] When Anne and
Cliff get a taste of my dish,

31:23.940 --> 31:27.550
they're going to say, "Hilda, girl,
why are you here in boot camp?"

31:29.550 --> 31:31.280
What is this?

31:31.290 --> 31:35.150
It is curry chicken
with ghost peppers.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.860
I made it all myself.

31:36.860 --> 31:38.060
I'm so proud of it.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.630
I'm scared to taste this.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.260
[Cliff] How many Ghost
peppers are in here?

31:41.260 --> 31:42.430
Just only, only two.

31:42.430 --> 31:44.100
- Only two.
- Only two.

31:44.100 --> 31:48.100
Yeah, it's not like I used ten.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.540
The amount of ghost pepper,
this is not a joke.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.110
This is not a drill.

32:01.010 --> 32:02.610
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.220
So, some... I'm sorry.

32:09.520 --> 32:10.990
That's me.

32:19.570 --> 32:22.300
I'm scared to taste this.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.800
[Cliff] How many ghost
peppers are in here?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.170
Just only, only two.

32:28.110 --> 32:31.210
The chicken's hot,
it's not as spicy as I thought

32:31.210 --> 32:32.910
<i>it was gonna be
with the two ghost peppers.</i>

32:32.910 --> 32:34.410
Have you made a curry before?

32:34.420 --> 32:35.910
No, this is my first time.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.180
Everything's burnt.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.150
- Okay.
- There you go.

32:39.150 --> 32:40.750
Um, um...

32:41.550 --> 32:43.060
There you go.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.260
Thank you.

32:44.260 --> 32:45.590
[laughing]

32:45.590 --> 32:48.390
- Deneise.
- Saved the best for last.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.900
[Deneise] Okay, swordfish,
broccoli, mac and cheese

32:51.900 --> 32:55.970
and don't
taste that mustard sauce.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.540
Should I not taste?

33:03.640 --> 33:05.010
Yeah, go ahead.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.550
Mustard?

33:07.550 --> 33:09.150
I created something in there,

33:09.150 --> 33:10.920
[Deneise] I can't
remember what it's called.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.320
[Anne] Mac and cheese doesn't
need to have eggs in it.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.050
Oh!

33:15.060 --> 33:18.660
You put it in the oven and then when
eggs cook, they do this, they firm up.

33:18.660 --> 33:19.990
Oh, okay.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.090
[Cliff] It tastes good.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.330
Texturally, we can...
It's not there at all.

33:24.330 --> 33:27.600
I am more surprised that
the fish is not overcooked.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.230
[Anne] Mine is like mushy.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.600
Oh, well.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.240
My piece is better.

33:33.910 --> 33:35.340
Hello, Chef Cliff.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.450
[mouthing]

33:44.150 --> 33:45.480
[Deneise speaking]

33:49.660 --> 33:51.420
There we go. Thank you.

33:53.060 --> 33:57.300
Welcome back, recruits, and welcome
to the first day of the rest of your lives.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.300
So for your first main
dish challenge,

33:59.300 --> 34:01.000
we are going to show you guys

34:01.000 --> 34:04.400
a dish that is full of love
and full of deliciousness.

34:04.410 --> 34:08.510
We're gonna show you guys how
to make a fancy surf and turf dinner.

34:08.510 --> 34:09.740
Yeah!

34:09.740 --> 34:10.980
[all cheering]

34:10.980 --> 34:12.480
Yeah!

34:14.080 --> 34:15.280
<i>[Melody] Surf and turf?</i>

34:15.280 --> 34:17.050
<i>What the hell
is a surf and turf?</i>

34:17.050 --> 34:18.580
Are we going surfing?

34:18.590 --> 34:21.250
And after Anne
and I taste your dishes,

34:21.260 --> 34:23.090
we will then decide
who we want on our team.

34:23.090 --> 34:24.360
- Ooh!
- Yes!

34:24.360 --> 34:26.590
Oh! Pick me, Cliff.

34:26.590 --> 34:29.930
So, let's hope your
meals impress us.

34:29.930 --> 34:32.230
Okay, recruits,
let's get cracking.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.600
- Yeah.
- All right.

34:35.170 --> 34:39.600
All right, recruits, you are making
these seared New York strip

34:39.610 --> 34:44.280
with crispy duck fat potatoes,
lobster and compound butter.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.540
Nice.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.750
The first thing I want
you guys to write down,

34:47.750 --> 34:50.380
it's a French term
mise-en-place,

34:51.280 --> 34:53.250
put in place.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.450
[Peachez] Mise...

34:54.460 --> 34:56.390
[unintelligible]

35:02.930 --> 35:04.160
That's what she said, right?

35:04.230 --> 35:08.200
Before we start, we get ready
all of our stuff that we need.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.140
This is a chef's knife.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.070
But don't worry,
we'll still let you use them.

35:12.070 --> 35:13.270
[all laughing]

35:13.270 --> 35:14.370
Okay.

35:14.370 --> 35:18.280
We pinch it and you drop
your other fingers downtown.

35:18.280 --> 35:22.850
If I see fingers like this, I will
come and color your fingers

35:22.850 --> 35:27.190
so that when you see that red
finger, it will remind you to tuck it in.

35:27.190 --> 35:29.520
To get started with
our court bouillon,

35:29.520 --> 35:34.560
I have a lemon, celery,
a whole bulb of garlic,

35:34.560 --> 35:37.400
gonna shave this parsley.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.130
Just gonna chop very finely.

35:40.130 --> 35:41.670
I have an onion.

35:41.670 --> 35:44.600
Cut this stem
and right off, cut it in half.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.810
Now we slice to the back,
but not through the back.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.840
We're gonna cut one
time and then we start

35:50.840 --> 35:54.450
just going downtown, and
there we go, right in there.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.820
Of course, we bring the party
with some white wine.

35:56.820 --> 36:00.220
The big thing that I have
not added to this yet, salt.

36:00.220 --> 36:04.020
Salt turns the volume up
on the flavor.

36:04.020 --> 36:05.460
It's the drag of cooking.

36:05.460 --> 36:07.090
It is the drag of cooking.

36:07.090 --> 36:08.560
[all laughing]

36:10.100 --> 36:11.960
So now, Cliff, this is for you.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.900
We are gonna create a delicious
bath for our potatoes to cook in.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.540
Peppercorn, garlic, thyme.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.270
We've got six potatoes.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.640
I'm cooking them just
until they're soft.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.180
I have my lobster,
and you see this guy's like...

36:27.580 --> 36:29.810
[indistinct chatter]

36:29.820 --> 36:33.550
This one, you want really nice
and active lobsters,

36:33.550 --> 36:35.950
because that means that
they're the freshest.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.720
Literally, my worst
nightmare on my first day.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.130
I'm touching that?

36:41.560 --> 36:42.890
No.

36:42.900 --> 36:47.000
All right, commit to it,
let it in there.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
All right.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.740
- Poor baby.
- There we go.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.740
This is a New York strip steak.

36:52.740 --> 36:55.410
You're gonna season it
with salt and pepper,

36:55.410 --> 36:57.940
it'll hold well to bottom of the
pan, because I want to sear

36:57.950 --> 37:02.080
that fat before I start
with the actual beef.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.250
My lobster's ready.

37:04.250 --> 37:07.020
It looks like me after
I've spent a day on the beach.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.320
[laughing]

37:08.320 --> 37:10.190
All right. We're just
gonna let it hang out.

37:10.190 --> 37:12.060
The fat cap on our steak
is rendered.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.330
We are now building
beautiful brown food.

37:14.330 --> 37:18.530
We're gonna baste our steaks with
rosemary and thyme, butter and our garlic.

37:18.530 --> 37:22.170
So I'm really infusing
the beef with all that flavor.

37:22.170 --> 37:25.440
Steaks are gonna go right
in our oven, 10 minutes.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.440
I'm going to be
making a compound butter

37:28.440 --> 37:33.850
and I'm going to use the
zest and juice of the lemon.

37:33.850 --> 37:38.080
I'm going to chop
this parsley very finely, then

37:38.090 --> 37:40.020
I get to use the big machinery.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.190
- Oh.
- There's no science to this.

37:42.190 --> 37:43.590
I'm just mixing.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.260
And when it's all
mixed up, I'm done.

37:47.260 --> 37:52.000
Our fingerling potatoes, we
are going to sear these in duck fat

37:52.000 --> 37:53.470
and get them nice and crispy.

37:53.470 --> 37:55.470
Now to the main event.

37:55.470 --> 37:58.370
I'm gonna take
the claws right off.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.440
I'm gonna cut right in half.

38:00.440 --> 38:01.770
Commit to it.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.240
- Oh, God!
- Oh.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.640
Bone crusher.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.380
I'm gonna take my lobster body.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.550
I'm just gonna give
it a quick little cook.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.490
Then we're going
to be ready to plate.

38:14.620 --> 38:16.520
We have steak.
We have potatoes.

38:17.590 --> 38:21.460
Now that lobster, That is it.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.860
- Do you guys want a taste it?
- [all] Yes.

38:23.860 --> 38:25.300
-Oh.
-[Anne] There you go. Come on up.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.870
Awesome! Thank you so much.

38:26.870 --> 38:28.400
Oh, my God.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.900
The potatoes are excellent.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.400
Okay.

38:31.410 --> 38:36.410
Recruits, you'll have 75 minutes
to replicate our surf and turf.

38:36.410 --> 38:39.310
And your time starts right now.

38:39.310 --> 38:40.410
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.610
Ah! Okay.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.150
[indistinct chatter]

38:52.430 --> 38:55.160
Cooking is fu-u-u-u-u-u-n.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.600
Na-na-na-na-na ba-bam.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.300
We're gonna make
a lobster today, today.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.970
This is gonna be great.

39:01.970 --> 39:04.870
I need celery and I also need
those little bowls, you know,

39:04.870 --> 39:06.440
the little things to put
the, um, chives in.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.470
The thing to put the chives in.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.540
I don't have those plastic tubs.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.080
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.910
There was two French words.
Coco, coco, coco, coco Chanel

39:12.910 --> 39:16.410
was the water
and then mise-en-place

39:16.420 --> 39:19.180
was like the, the keeping
everything organized.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.150
Oh, it's the-the mise-en-place

39:22.160 --> 39:25.020
or something French about
putting things in its place.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.460
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.230
Oh...

39:28.230 --> 39:29.560
It's like watching <i>I Love Lucy.</i>

39:29.560 --> 39:31.900
[indistinct shouting]

39:31.900 --> 39:33.900
Move, move, move.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.670
Let me borrow your little spoon?

39:35.670 --> 39:38.400
Girl, if you don't stop coming
over here bothering me.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.570
My gosh!

39:42.170 --> 39:43.910
- Hi, Deneise.
- Oh, my.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.110
Oh, snap.

39:45.110 --> 39:46.310
- [gasps]
- Give it up.

39:46.310 --> 39:47.450
Give it up.

39:47.450 --> 39:49.210
Our very first red finger.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.850
There you go.

39:50.850 --> 39:53.220
So when you... Choke up
on the knife.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.890
- Choke up on the knife.
- Yeah. There you go.

39:54.890 --> 39:56.290
- Like that.
- Thank you.

39:56.290 --> 39:58.960
Cut in half. Like this, Angie?
Half like this?

39:58.960 --> 40:00.990
-[Angie] No, don't cut the hair.
-I didn't cut the hair.

40:00.990 --> 40:02.430
- No, no, no, no.
- Like this?

40:02.430 --> 40:04.530
-Yeah, yeah. No, no, no.
-But it'll roll. So it's gonna be like this.

40:04.530 --> 40:06.230
Cut it... Cut it in half.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.500
Like, I tried to help Cheyenne,
but I'm so worried that

40:08.500 --> 40:09.900
I'm going to give
her the wrong answer.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.900
<i>I don't know.
Don't cut the hair.</i>

40:11.910 --> 40:15.270
When Angie is talking to me while
we're cooking, I totally zone her out.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.510
I may ask her a question, but then I
don't stick around to hear the answer.

40:18.510 --> 40:20.080
[Angie]
You did cut through your hair?

40:20.080 --> 40:22.180
No, I didn't get my hair close
enough to the board to cut it.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.350
You didn't...
No, the onion hair.

40:24.350 --> 40:26.890
Why are you even
asking me for help...

40:26.890 --> 40:28.220
Moral support?

40:28.220 --> 40:29.620
You're driving me nuts.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.960
I'm gonna put
the lobster in here.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.360
Did you taste it?
Does it taste good?

40:34.360 --> 40:35.830
Don't forget to taste it.

40:35.830 --> 40:37.600
Don't forget to taste it.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.730
I have to grab you
and it's gonna be okay.

40:41.070 --> 40:42.470
-[Cheyenne] Oh
-[Marti] Oh.

40:42.470 --> 40:44.440
Stop moving, stop moving!
Stop moving, stop moving!

40:44.440 --> 40:45.600
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.210
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

40:47.210 --> 40:48.310
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

40:48.310 --> 40:49.970
Hi, Angie.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.540
[Angie] I love it.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.080
[Deneise] All right.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.610
I can't avoid it any longer.

40:54.610 --> 40:55.950
The water's ready.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.320
I got to go get this lobster.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.520
This is not gonna be pretty.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.790
I don't care how
good they say it tastes,

41:02.290 --> 41:04.920
It looks like
the cockroach of the sea.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.090
[Deneise screams]

41:06.090 --> 41:07.160
Just...

41:07.160 --> 41:08.460
Oh!

41:08.460 --> 41:10.400
Ugh, eyes, antennas...

41:10.400 --> 41:11.460
[bleep]

41:11.470 --> 41:12.800
Take the wheel.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.200
Deneise, it's actually
easier if you use your hands.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.900
<i>I'm just worried I've
run out of boot camp,</i>

41:16.900 --> 41:20.000
because I do not
want to touch that lobster.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.370
- Give me one that's not moving.
- Deneise.

41:21.370 --> 41:22.410
What?

41:22.410 --> 41:25.040
It's actually easier
if you use your hands.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.450
[mimics Anne]
No, you can't use the tongs!

41:27.450 --> 41:28.580
Use your hands!

41:28.580 --> 41:30.220
- Deneise.
- Yes. What?

41:30.220 --> 41:31.820
Grab the lobster.
Grab the lobster.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.590
Like, who the hell
are you talking to?

41:33.590 --> 41:35.890
What? I'm not gonna
touch that thing.

41:35.890 --> 41:37.590
[Anne] You can do it.

41:37.590 --> 41:40.590
There's absolutely no way that I'm
going to touch that lobster with my hands.

41:40.590 --> 41:42.160
<i>Not today.</i>

41:57.040 --> 41:59.240
Gotta use my hand to
touch this stupid thing.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.380
- Deneise?
- Yes. What?

42:00.380 --> 42:01.480
Grab the lobster!

42:01.480 --> 42:03.250
I don't like seafood.

42:03.250 --> 42:05.480
<i>I'm looking for one that's
almost dead, if not dead.</i>

42:05.490 --> 42:08.750
[laughing]
Not moving for sure.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.320
I'm right here
for moral support.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.590
I've never touched it alive.

42:11.590 --> 42:13.590
Maybe I should do this one
because the other one's moving.

42:13.590 --> 42:16.360
Okay, but just grab
it like right there.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.960
- [gasps]
- Oh, God.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.760
You can do it.
Face your fears.

42:19.770 --> 42:20.930
<i>[Deneise] Clock is ticking.</i>

42:20.930 --> 42:22.270
I've got to do this.

42:22.270 --> 42:25.940
I'm not gonna let this lobster
come between me and $25000.

42:25.940 --> 42:27.070
Ugh!

42:27.070 --> 42:28.410
Move, I'm gonna run.

42:28.410 --> 42:29.840
- Okay.
- Girl, move.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.440
[bleep]

42:33.210 --> 42:36.150
Y'all don't know
how scared I was.

42:36.150 --> 42:37.520
Oh!

42:37.520 --> 42:39.350
One hour, everybody!

42:39.350 --> 42:41.450
[screams]

42:41.450 --> 42:44.560
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.490
For all the little baby drag queens
out there, you can do anything

42:47.490 --> 42:50.960
you all put your mind to,
even slice and dice an onion.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.230
Cliff or Anne?

42:52.230 --> 42:53.300
Yes?

42:53.300 --> 42:54.530
[Melody] This is right, yeah?

42:54.530 --> 42:55.630
It looks great so far.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.440
Just tuck your nails in more.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.870
[Anne] Tuck your thumb behind.

42:59.870 --> 43:01.210
[Cliff]
Tuck your thumb behind.

43:01.210 --> 43:04.510
How did so much effort and
thought go into holding a knife?

43:06.350 --> 43:07.980
Oh. Oh, my God.

43:07.980 --> 43:09.110
Number two red finger.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.210
Got it!

43:10.220 --> 43:11.550
- Thanks, chef.
- Sure thing.

43:11.550 --> 43:14.920
She comes over here
and touches my finger again,

43:14.920 --> 43:18.160
I might take that marker
and give her red finger.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.620
Don't go there, girlfriend.

43:19.630 --> 43:22.190
So much chaos.
I can't even concentrate.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.260
Gotta bunch it, like that.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.500
Don't forget to set your timers
and let's get your potatoes in,

43:27.500 --> 43:29.530
right, because they take the
longest, they should be cooking.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.000
Okay.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.500
- No, no, no.
- Oh, that's real hot.

43:32.510 --> 43:34.170
Hot water is terrifying.

43:34.170 --> 43:35.170
- Lower.
- Lower, lower, lower.

43:35.180 --> 43:36.210
- It's not gonna...
- Okay.

43:36.210 --> 43:37.780
The water, the water is
not gonna up at you.

43:37.780 --> 43:39.340
That's not,
that's not gonna happen.

43:39.350 --> 43:40.780
- It's not gonna jump out of there.
- Okay.

43:40.780 --> 43:42.450
Boiling water is evil.

43:44.380 --> 43:45.780
You can do it, Kara.
You can do it.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.250
Just grab it.

43:47.250 --> 43:49.020
Just go. Just grab it.

43:49.020 --> 43:51.790
And... [screams]

43:51.790 --> 43:53.460
[Peachez]
This water is not boiling.

43:53.460 --> 43:57.500
What's wrong with this stove? I don't
know how to make this boil any quicker.

43:57.500 --> 44:00.530
It doesn't help but I...
Oh! Hi.

44:00.530 --> 44:04.170
- Hello. Hello.
- I told myself after last time that

44:04.170 --> 44:06.140
I was gonna keep
a cleaner station.

44:06.140 --> 44:08.040
It's because you taught us
about the thank you and go.

44:08.040 --> 44:09.570
So, thank you
for coming, all right.

44:09.580 --> 44:11.410
- Thank you for coming.
- There you go.

44:11.410 --> 44:12.440
That was a little bit ruder.

44:12.450 --> 44:14.850
- Thank you, go.
- Right.

44:14.850 --> 44:20.150
Marti and Peachez, I mean,
a whole lot of fabulosity.

44:20.150 --> 44:22.290
All right, your board
looks a little bit messy.

44:22.290 --> 44:23.220
Yeah.

44:23.220 --> 44:25.960
They bring the fun,
they bring in the party.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.430
I just hope they can focus.

44:27.430 --> 44:29.190
- You're doing good Mart-Mart?
- Shh.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.860
Stop shushing me.

44:30.860 --> 44:32.300
I'm just caring about you.

44:32.300 --> 44:34.970
Girl, if you, if you stop talking, I
will give you the whole 25,000.

44:34.970 --> 44:36.430
If I stop talking?

44:36.440 --> 44:38.640
I talk
when I get nervous, though.

44:40.940 --> 44:43.740
[Anne] Al, those are chives.

44:43.740 --> 44:46.940
Those go in the lobster
when you saute it.

44:46.950 --> 44:48.510
You need parsley for that.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.110
- Parsley?
- Parsley.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.950
Oh, okay.

44:51.950 --> 44:53.820
She showed us this in the demo.

44:53.820 --> 44:56.150
You shave the parsley.

44:58.860 --> 45:00.360
[AL]
How the hell did she do that?

45:00.360 --> 45:02.060
You see these paws,

45:02.060 --> 45:07.230
it is really hard to not cut myself
to begin with, but yet shave it.

45:09.940 --> 45:11.140
[AL] Damn.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.300
Al, how are you?

45:12.310 --> 45:13.440
I'm sweating.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.770
What's going on?
Are you doing okay?

45:14.770 --> 45:16.010
I'm busy, I'm hot.
How are you?

45:16.010 --> 45:17.140
Yes. I'm wet as a dog.

45:17.140 --> 45:18.580
[laughing] Join the club.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.480
All right.
Did your timer just go off?

45:20.480 --> 45:22.380
- I think... Yeah.
- That's for your lobster.

45:22.380 --> 45:24.220
- [Al] Yeah!
- [Anne] Look at that.

45:24.220 --> 45:25.550
<i>Your very first lobster.</i>

45:25.550 --> 45:26.950
Hoo-hoo!

45:26.950 --> 45:28.390
- Actually looks pretty good.
- Right?

45:28.390 --> 45:29.750
That doesn't go there.

45:29.760 --> 45:30.990
Where does it go?

45:30.990 --> 45:32.560
That goes on a sheet tray.

45:32.560 --> 45:33.830
- It's cooked.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

45:33.830 --> 45:35.260
Thanks, Cliff.

45:36.230 --> 45:39.900
You are welcome to
come by any time you like.

45:39.900 --> 45:42.030
<i>♪ Ba-dam pum, pow-pow ♪</i>

45:42.040 --> 45:44.470
<i>♪ I'm feeling okay today ♪</i>

45:44.470 --> 45:46.640
<i>♪ Ba-dam pum, pow-pow ♪</i>

45:46.640 --> 45:49.170
<i>♪ I'm gonna cook
a steak today ♪</i>

45:49.180 --> 45:51.310
[Cliff] Hector?

45:51.310 --> 45:52.810
That looks great.
Let's start basting it.

45:52.810 --> 45:53.980
[Hector] Okay.

45:53.980 --> 45:56.510
Hector in this round is
kind of like a lost puppy.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.920
Like, he knows where to
go to the bathroom

45:57.920 --> 45:59.620
and then like, he's proud of
himself

45:59.620 --> 46:01.620
because he just went to the
bathroom, but he's looking

46:01.620 --> 46:03.420
for something else to pee on.

46:03.420 --> 46:05.260
I can't say that. I'm sorry.

46:05.260 --> 46:07.590
Oh, my God, don't burn
on me, okay, dude?

46:07.590 --> 46:10.030
[Cheyenne] I think it has to
be in the pan to cook, though.

46:10.030 --> 46:11.930
[Angie]
No, but it's gonna burn.

46:11.930 --> 46:13.630
[both] Whoa!

46:13.630 --> 46:15.330
It's firecrackers over here.

46:15.340 --> 46:16.500
[laughs]

46:16.500 --> 46:18.370
Ooh! You cannot touch that.

46:18.370 --> 46:21.670
Oh, my God, my steak is
on the side burning [bleep].

46:21.670 --> 46:23.710
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

46:24.280 --> 46:25.940
Get up.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.510
Oh, that's not even
browned yet. Never mind.

46:27.510 --> 46:29.510
Your food's on fire.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.650
Whoo! Whoo!

46:31.650 --> 46:33.890
How do you stop a fire
when it's inside the pot?

46:33.890 --> 46:35.190
- [Hilda] Oh...
- Hello?

46:35.190 --> 46:36.420
Crap! I got a full full.

46:36.420 --> 46:37.690
I got full on fire
going on here.

46:37.690 --> 46:38.990
Hello?

46:38.990 --> 46:42.260
I'm just gonna keep ignoring
this fire since everybody else is.

46:42.260 --> 46:44.260
And just keep cooking my steak.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.330
Just keep cooking my steak.

46:46.330 --> 46:49.600
Oh, wow,
that green thing is on fire.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.040
Yes, it is.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.140
Mmm-hmm.

46:52.140 --> 46:53.340
Okay.

46:53.340 --> 46:54.970
All right, this steak is done.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.410
I don't know what's going on.

46:59.410 --> 47:02.010
I'm so confused right now.

47:02.020 --> 47:04.080
I thought this was gonna go
so much better than it's going.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.650
This is a disaster.

47:05.650 --> 47:07.920
I don't really even know
for sure where I'm at.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.150
So, I'm just being honest.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.920
[producer speaking]

47:11.930 --> 47:15.130
Everything.
Everything, everything.

47:17.130 --> 47:19.400
How do more people
not squall on this show?

47:19.400 --> 47:21.570
No. You are good.
You are good.

47:21.570 --> 47:23.970
-Okay.
-We're good. We're good. This is why we're here. Okay?

47:23.970 --> 47:28.410
- I know it's really bad.
- No, it's not really bad.

47:28.410 --> 47:29.710
- Okay.
- You can do this.

47:29.710 --> 47:31.510
Chef Cliff gives me the pep
talk that I need to finish.

47:31.510 --> 47:33.610
This is exactly what I want
you to do and in this order, okay?

47:33.610 --> 47:35.050
- You're gonna go grab garlic.
- Okay.

47:35.050 --> 47:36.450
You're gonna smash the garlic.

47:36.450 --> 47:38.480
You're gonna put the garlic in
there and then you're gonna baste.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.450
Then immediately, you're gonna
take that, you're gonna put it on that

47:40.450 --> 47:42.020
rack and that's gonna
go in there for 10 minutes.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.220
It's the first thing
you're gonna do.

47:43.220 --> 47:44.860
When you get back, you're
gonna crush these potatoes,

47:44.860 --> 47:47.290
you're gonna put duck fat in here and
then you're gonna start cooking potatoes.

47:47.290 --> 47:49.890
You're not gonna do anything else
except for that. Do you understand?

47:49.900 --> 47:51.100
Got it! Yes! It's game time!

47:51.100 --> 47:52.530
Got it! Okay.

47:57.940 --> 47:59.140
Oh...

48:01.210 --> 48:02.440
Phew!

48:02.440 --> 48:04.010
I forgot what he said to do.

48:04.010 --> 48:06.180
15 minutes left, recruits.

48:06.180 --> 48:07.350
- Ahh!
- I don't know what to do.

48:07.350 --> 48:09.250
I literally don't know
what to do.

48:09.250 --> 48:10.780
I'm gonna move this up here.

48:10.780 --> 48:12.220
Oh, shoot. Ouch.

48:12.220 --> 48:14.150
I got to get the pan
for the potatoes ready.

48:14.150 --> 48:17.090
I am so ungodly nervous
about these potatoes

48:17.090 --> 48:20.760
because I want to do
them, you know, right.

48:20.760 --> 48:23.630
So we just put the
potatoes in the duck fat.

48:23.630 --> 48:27.230
Let's get the duck sauce, baby.

48:27.230 --> 48:29.070
Quack-quack, quack-quack.

48:29.070 --> 48:30.670
We gotta duck walk,
duck walk, duck walk,

48:30.670 --> 48:32.570
duck walk, duck walk, duck
walk. Cluckety-cluck-cluck...

48:32.570 --> 48:33.440
Oh, my knees.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.110
Careful, the fire.
Careful, the fire.

48:35.110 --> 48:38.480
Now I have to get the duck sauce
onto the pan that should be preheated.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.840
Two tablespoons.

48:39.850 --> 48:41.280
This is two tablespoons, right?

48:41.280 --> 48:43.410
Scoop, scoop, scoop,
scoop, scoop, scoop.

48:44.050 --> 48:45.050
[Marti] Ouch!

48:45.050 --> 48:46.920
[Peachez] You're okay?
Take it off the flame.

48:46.920 --> 48:48.550
- Take it off the...
- Put a lid on it.

48:48.550 --> 48:50.020
- Put it down.
- [Cliff] Put it down, Marti!

48:50.020 --> 48:53.420
I feel like every bit of makeup
on my face is completely

48:53.430 --> 48:57.460
melted off
and the fire won't go out.

48:57.460 --> 48:59.160
Put a lid on it.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.030
Get a lid, a pan lid.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.140
Oh, my God.

49:04.140 --> 49:05.640
- [Anne] There we go.
- Oh my God.

49:05.640 --> 49:08.570
Smokey the bear herself
could not put this out.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.240
Oh, my God.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.380
- Sorry.
- Oh!

49:11.380 --> 49:12.980
That's all right.
It happens all the time.

49:12.980 --> 49:14.250
Sorry. Okay.

49:14.250 --> 49:16.010
I'm just gonna take this off.

49:16.020 --> 49:17.210
Oh, my God.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.120
Ha, ha, ha.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.650
[Anne] All right, Here we...

49:20.650 --> 49:22.020
Keep the hair safe.

49:22.020 --> 49:23.390
Yes, there we go.

49:23.390 --> 49:25.420
I'm not about to catch on
fire in this kitchen, okay?

49:25.430 --> 49:27.560
Boom! Fire's out.
We're good to go.

49:28.960 --> 49:30.760
Oh damn it! It's still on.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.200
You think we're good to go?

49:32.200 --> 49:34.130
I take the lid off,
what happened?

49:34.130 --> 49:36.500
Boom! How's it not out?

49:43.310 --> 49:44.780
Put it on a very low heat.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.350
Oh damn it! It's still on.

49:48.350 --> 49:51.220
The lid, and then the lid came
off and there was still fire.

49:51.220 --> 49:53.650
The fire kept coming.
It was so much fire.

49:53.650 --> 49:55.990
And it was non-stop fire.
I couldn't believe it.

49:55.990 --> 49:58.620
[Marti] <i>Boom, boom, boom,
boom. We're all gonna die.</i>

49:58.620 --> 50:00.360
The fire makes sense now,
doesn't it?

50:01.390 --> 50:02.290
Thank you, chef.

50:02.300 --> 50:03.560
Oh, my gosh.

50:03.560 --> 50:06.530
- What did you do to this poor...
- I left it on too long.

50:06.530 --> 50:08.930
You think? Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

50:09.770 --> 50:10.940
It's all right.

50:10.940 --> 50:12.940
It happens all the time.

50:12.940 --> 50:15.110
Don't cry, don't cry, don't
cry, don't cry, don't cry.

50:15.110 --> 50:18.010
Recruits,
you have five minutes left.

50:33.660 --> 50:35.090
[Eddie] Son of a gun.

50:35.090 --> 50:36.390
This is impossible.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.830
Can't be done.

50:37.830 --> 50:39.430
Come on, have something
come out pretty.

50:39.430 --> 50:40.970
Okay,
I'm seeing what you're doing.

50:40.970 --> 50:43.100
[Kara] Have something
come out pretty.

50:47.310 --> 50:48.440
[sighs]

50:48.440 --> 50:53.410
Now comes all my fear
to crack open this lobster.

50:54.980 --> 50:57.150
Don't think about it, Bianca,
you have to do this.

50:57.150 --> 50:58.480
Okay. I got it.

50:58.480 --> 50:59.980
[coughs]

50:59.990 --> 51:01.850
[Anne]
Bianca, you hit it harder.

51:01.850 --> 51:04.420
- Pretend it's Hector.
- Not that hard.

51:06.060 --> 51:08.190
All right.
That's one way to do it.

51:08.190 --> 51:10.460
- Marti, look at your steak.

I'm starting a fire again.

51:29.050 --> 51:30.310
- Deneise?
- Yes, sir.

51:30.320 --> 51:31.550
Let's get the lobster
on the plate.

51:31.550 --> 51:32.920
There's a minute left.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.190
- Okay.
- [Hilda] A minute?

51:34.190 --> 51:36.150
-Yes. Only one minute.
-[Hilda] Hurry, Deneise, hurry.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.220
That is so good.

51:37.220 --> 51:38.760
- How did you get it done?
- Are you done?

51:38.760 --> 51:40.290
[Deneise]
Um, now I've got things to do.

51:40.290 --> 51:41.360
[Cliff]
Okay, so let's do them.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.760
- Yes.
- Do them!

51:42.760 --> 51:43.990
- I was eating.
- [Anne] Okay.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.060
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.430
Well, all right.

51:46.430 --> 51:48.000
Let us know
when you're off break.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.300
Al, come on.

51:49.300 --> 51:50.600
-I got.
-All right. Let's go. Let's go.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.070
[Al] This is not good.

51:52.070 --> 51:53.340
[Anne] Ten seconds.

51:53.340 --> 51:55.270
Your food's got
to be on the plate.

51:55.270 --> 51:57.210
Oh, my God. I never
knew I could cook so good.

51:57.210 --> 51:58.240
He, he, he, great.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.980
Put it on the plate, Hector.

51:59.980 --> 52:02.650
[Anne and Cliff]
Five, four, three...

52:02.650 --> 52:04.250
Presentation, presentation.

52:04.250 --> 52:05.350
[Anne and Cliff] Two, one.

52:05.350 --> 52:06.420
That's it. Hands up.

52:06.420 --> 52:08.290
[imitates trumpet music]

52:08.290 --> 52:09.520
[Marti] All right.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.360
[Eddie]
Hey, that looks pretty good.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.760
Go try some surf and turf.

52:15.530 --> 52:17.390
- Marti, you're up.
- Okay.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.730
I made steak and potatoes
for them twice now.

52:19.730 --> 52:22.370
If I didn't improve,
I'm out of here.

52:27.210 --> 52:28.410
[Cliff] The lobster
itself is cooked well.

52:28.410 --> 52:29.940
Oh!

52:29.940 --> 52:31.980
- Are we missing some claw meat here?
- [Marti] They're, they're...

52:31.980 --> 52:33.140
He's waving at you right there.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.150
[Anne]
What about the arm meat?

52:34.150 --> 52:36.280
I couldn't get it crack...
which is a lesson

52:36.280 --> 52:39.020
and I should not wear nails
in the kitchen,

52:39.020 --> 52:41.220
so we're gonna...
cut these babies.

52:41.220 --> 52:43.050
- Bit 'em all.
- Just bite 'em all up.

52:43.060 --> 52:45.190
Steak is seasoned well, and
it's actually very well-rested.

52:45.190 --> 52:47.220
- Really?
- Yeah, it is.

52:49.930 --> 52:52.030
- [Cliff] Kara.
- [Anne] How did you this experience?

52:52.030 --> 52:53.230
Overwhelming.

52:53.230 --> 52:56.130
Presentation
is a little bit off.

52:56.140 --> 53:00.000
When it's all piled up like
this, it doesn't do it justice.

53:00.010 --> 53:04.180
I am just lucky to
have it on the plate.

53:04.180 --> 53:10.210
[Anne] Your steak looks cooked
nicely, but there's like a lot of pepper.

53:10.220 --> 53:13.020
Your potatoes
are not cooked through.

53:13.020 --> 53:15.990
Your lobster is cooked
nicely, but we needed

53:15.990 --> 53:18.560
to saute the, the claws and the,
and the arm meat. Don't worry.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.460
I can't help it. I'm sorry.

53:20.460 --> 53:23.390
What should have been easier
you had a little bit of difficulty with,

53:23.400 --> 53:26.930
which is something that you'll need
to work on, but I know you can do it.

53:26.930 --> 53:28.370
Okay.

53:28.370 --> 53:29.500
[Cliff] Eddie.

53:29.500 --> 53:31.240
Going into tasting,
I don't have it all there.

53:31.240 --> 53:33.740
So I'm not sure
how they're gonna react.

53:33.740 --> 53:35.440
Things did not go well.

53:35.440 --> 53:37.510
[Cliff] Temperature
for steak is great.

53:37.510 --> 53:39.840
The temperature
on the lobster is great.

53:39.850 --> 53:43.150
Um, I'm missing the knuckles
and the claws.

53:43.150 --> 53:46.350
The entirety of the animal
needs to be on the plate.

53:46.350 --> 53:49.020
Across the board,
seasoning is low.

53:49.550 --> 53:51.620
Peachez, come on up.

53:55.130 --> 53:59.200
I enjoyed the time...
I... Oh, well.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.030
There it is.

54:01.030 --> 54:02.400
I'll just have one piece.

54:02.400 --> 54:03.930
[laughing]

54:03.940 --> 54:06.840
[Cliff] The temperature of
your beef, great job.

54:06.840 --> 54:10.070
[Anne] The seasoning on your steak,
it's a little bit too much on the salt.

54:10.080 --> 54:14.140
Your potatoes could have been a lot
crispier, but your lobster is nicely cooked.

54:14.150 --> 54:16.580
It's a very nice
looking plate of food.

54:16.580 --> 54:19.220
Look at all of this.

54:19.220 --> 54:21.390
Of course, the plating is good.

54:21.390 --> 54:23.490
Hilda, come on.

54:23.490 --> 54:24.990
- [Anne] Come on.
- Come on. You can do it.

54:24.990 --> 54:29.990
Oh, my God. What if it's
not as good as I think it is?

54:32.300 --> 54:34.970
We need to work on
the seasoning just as a whole.

54:34.970 --> 54:36.400
- More salt? Okay.
- More salt.

54:36.400 --> 54:38.140
But your steak is nicely cooked.

54:38.140 --> 54:40.170
Your lobster is nicely cooked.

54:40.170 --> 54:43.940
I can tell this was a plate of food made by
someone that liked what they were doing.

54:43.940 --> 54:45.610
I truly enjoyed it.

54:45.610 --> 54:47.140
And yes, I will do it again.

54:47.150 --> 54:48.450
All right.

54:48.450 --> 54:50.450
[Anne] Cheyenne, come on up.

54:50.450 --> 54:51.550
[Cheyenne] Here you go.

54:51.550 --> 54:52.780
[Anne] All right.

54:53.820 --> 54:55.250
[Cliff] There's a lot of
pepper on the steak.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.120
Your basting herbs
burned a little bit.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.060
- The actual temperature is fantastic.
- Awesome!

54:59.060 --> 55:01.160
Your station though,
you need to keep it clean-er.

55:01.160 --> 55:02.990
Okay.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.060
You need to get in the habit of
using both hands when you're cooking.

55:07.070 --> 55:08.570
- [Cheyenne] Okay.
- You're not a T-Rex.

55:08.570 --> 55:11.270
- Okay.
- You learn something new every day.

55:11.270 --> 55:13.000
[roaring]

55:14.040 --> 55:16.610
[Anne] Angie, come on up.
Oh, Angie.

55:16.610 --> 55:18.080
[Cliff] It's a beautiful
plate of food.

55:18.080 --> 55:20.210
Thank you.

55:20.210 --> 55:22.450
You did a great job
cooking the lobster.

55:22.450 --> 55:24.950
Your steak is seasoned nicely.

55:24.950 --> 55:27.350
It has an uneven sear.

55:27.350 --> 55:30.690
And then because of that, the
steak is less cooked than it should be.

55:30.690 --> 55:32.560
But I think a very nice job.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.820
Okay.

55:33.830 --> 55:34.790
Deneise.

55:34.790 --> 55:36.290
<i>[Deneise] Walking
up to Anne and Cliff,</i>

55:36.300 --> 55:38.030
I just want to die right
there with the lobster.

55:38.030 --> 55:39.400
Just die.

55:39.400 --> 55:41.200
Was this the first time
you've cooked the lobster?

55:41.200 --> 55:42.870
First time I've ever
cooked the lobster.

55:42.870 --> 55:44.100
[Cliff]
So I see you tried to cut it.

55:44.100 --> 55:45.670
I massacred that lobster.

55:45.670 --> 55:47.100
It didn't have a good death.

55:47.110 --> 55:50.170
The lobster is cooked very
well, but it needs to be seasoned.

55:53.140 --> 55:55.250
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

55:56.580 --> 55:57.920
Um...

55:57.920 --> 56:00.320
There's no avoiding it.
Your steak is burnt.

56:00.320 --> 56:02.290
Yeah. Of course it's burnt.

56:02.290 --> 56:03.320
It was on fire.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.190
The beef tastes like carbon.

56:05.190 --> 56:07.930
That's pretty much all
you taste, it's just burned.

56:07.930 --> 56:11.860
So it's burned on one side and
then not seared enough on the other.

56:11.860 --> 56:14.530
[Deneise] <i>Based on the
disaster that I had in the kitchen,</i>

56:14.530 --> 56:16.400
I'll be surprised if I get
picked up for a team.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.070
Ooh.

56:24.480 --> 56:27.750
Bianca, how did you feel
about this round?

56:27.750 --> 56:29.350
My worst nightmare.

56:29.350 --> 56:31.880
But you faced
your fears and you did it.

56:31.880 --> 56:34.280
[Cliff] The cook on the
lobster is a little over.

56:34.290 --> 56:36.090
One side of the steak is
beautifully seared and seasoned.

56:36.090 --> 56:38.560
This side is bland.

56:38.560 --> 56:42.830
I can tell that this is a plate
of food made a tentative cook.

56:42.830 --> 56:44.230
If you make it past today,

56:44.230 --> 56:48.900
I want to see you come in here
and I am like, "I'm bad... Bianca."

56:48.900 --> 56:53.740
Bad... Bianca. Bad... Bianca.
Bad... Bianca.

56:53.740 --> 56:55.410
[Anne] Al, come on up.

56:55.410 --> 56:56.770
There you go.

56:56.780 --> 56:58.740
[Anne] Your steak is very,
very, very rare.

56:58.740 --> 57:00.010
I'm not sure how I got it rare.

57:00.010 --> 57:02.110
[Anne] It's because
it's not seared enough.

57:02.110 --> 57:04.920
The seasoning on your
steak, however, is very nice.

57:04.920 --> 57:08.450
There is a little excess
extra on the pepper, though.

57:08.450 --> 57:09.590
Oops.

57:09.590 --> 57:11.890
I'm sorry.
I love pepper, so...

57:11.890 --> 57:13.720
We'll temper that back
a little bit.

57:13.730 --> 57:14.990
[Anne] Melody, come on up.

57:14.990 --> 57:16.560
[Cliff] How did you feel
about this process today?

57:16.560 --> 57:20.260
Just the execution could have
been a little bit better.

57:20.270 --> 57:21.800
[Cliff] Temperature
on the steak is great.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.030
Cutting the steak, not so great.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.970
[Anne] Your lobster
actually looks really good.

57:24.970 --> 57:28.170
It's just missing the parts and
it's missing compound butter.

57:28.170 --> 57:31.010
But you know, there's a lot of
good stuff going on here.

57:32.080 --> 57:33.840
[Cliff] Hector?

57:33.850 --> 57:36.050
[Hector] <i>That's like
my baby right there.</i>

57:36.050 --> 57:38.380
I want to take pictures
and put it in my living room.

57:38.380 --> 57:40.180
[Anne laughing]

57:42.990 --> 57:46.020
Your steak is a bit
on the overcooked side,

57:46.030 --> 57:49.060
and it's really dry, your
lobster looks really nice,

57:49.060 --> 57:50.290
your potatoes look really nice.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.330
The crust on your steak
looks really nice.

57:52.330 --> 57:54.300
You just need to do it faster.

57:54.300 --> 57:56.430
I mean, we get slow
and steady wins the race,

57:56.440 --> 57:58.170
but we gotta put it
into, like, second gear.

57:58.170 --> 57:59.300
Okay.

57:59.310 --> 58:00.740
This is real thing, dude.

58:00.740 --> 58:02.440
Like, we have to win.

58:02.440 --> 58:03.470
Wake up!

58:04.910 --> 58:06.040
Welcome back, recruits.

58:06.050 --> 58:07.510
Now that Anne
and I have had time

58:07.510 --> 58:11.320
to fully digest the food
that you made for us.

58:11.320 --> 58:12.580
It's time to pick a winner.

58:12.590 --> 58:14.020
A winner, a winner?

58:14.020 --> 58:15.920
Oh, honey!

58:15.920 --> 58:18.960
[Anne] Cliff and I
have decided the recruit

58:18.960 --> 58:22.960
with the most successful
surf and turf today is

58:26.500 --> 58:27.930
Angie.

58:27.930 --> 58:29.130
Whoa!

58:29.130 --> 58:30.930
I am just on top of the world.

58:30.940 --> 58:34.940
Rainbows, clouds everywhere, stars,
everything is jumping at me right now.

58:34.940 --> 58:36.770
Ah! Unbelievable.

58:36.780 --> 58:42.550
And, Angie, not only have you won the
challenge this week, you will take home $1000.

58:42.550 --> 58:44.110
Oh, my God!

58:44.120 --> 58:45.380
[all cheering]

58:46.180 --> 58:47.350
Oh, my God!

58:47.350 --> 58:49.490
Show me the money, honey!

58:49.490 --> 58:51.920
Oh, yeah! Go, girl!
Oo-oo! Oo-oo!

58:51.920 --> 58:53.290
Thank you.

58:53.290 --> 58:55.130
Now it's time to pick teams.

58:55.890 --> 58:57.060
Okay.

58:57.060 --> 59:00.160
Cliff, since this is your
first time in boot camp,

59:00.170 --> 59:02.770
I'm going to give you
the honor of picking first.

59:02.770 --> 59:04.500
Thank you very much
for being so gracious.

59:04.500 --> 59:07.910
This is probably gonna
surprise this first recruit,

59:07.910 --> 59:10.640
but my first choice
for the blue team is

59:12.880 --> 59:14.010
Bianca.

59:14.010 --> 59:16.910
[all cheering]

59:16.920 --> 59:19.620
Cliff called my name first.

59:19.620 --> 59:21.420
Holy...!

59:23.220 --> 59:25.320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

59:25.320 --> 59:30.460
The first member of
the Rockin' Red Stars is,

59:31.300 --> 59:32.760
Al.

59:32.770 --> 59:34.260
Yes!

59:34.270 --> 59:35.500
Yes!

59:35.500 --> 59:38.440
I am so excited to be
a Rockin' Red Star.

59:38.440 --> 59:41.410
<i>When my wife sees this,
she's probably gonna cry,</i>

59:41.410 --> 59:43.170
because that's all I wanted.

59:45.080 --> 59:46.380
Melody.

59:46.380 --> 59:47.510
Oh, wow!

59:47.510 --> 59:49.250
[Cliff] Melody, come on
up and get your apron.

59:49.250 --> 59:51.180
I'm so excited.

59:51.180 --> 59:52.750
[Anne] Angie.

59:52.750 --> 59:54.380
Yeah.

59:54.390 --> 59:56.550
Welcome to the Red team.

59:56.560 --> 59:59.590
There you go. Yay!

59:59.590 --> 1:00:01.330
Peachez, come on
up and get your apron.

1:00:01.330 --> 1:00:02.630
Ahh!

1:00:04.130 --> 1:00:08.100
It's such a dream come... No
offense, but a dream come true.

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.530
He called me.

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:11.100
Uh...

1:00:11.100 --> 1:00:13.270
You can't have all that
fabulosity.

1:00:13.270 --> 1:00:15.470
Marti, welcome to the Red team.

1:00:15.470 --> 1:00:16.740
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:17.940
Thank you!

1:00:17.940 --> 1:00:20.080
Boom! Let's go, Red!

1:00:21.150 --> 1:00:23.010
- Cheyenne.
- Yes!

1:00:24.050 --> 1:00:25.550
- Thank you so much.
- It will be fantastic.

1:00:25.550 --> 1:00:27.320
Thank you.

1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:30.050
- Kara.
- [Kara screams]

1:00:30.060 --> 1:00:32.390
Oh my God!

1:00:32.390 --> 1:00:35.030
I'm on Anne's team.
Oh, my God!

1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:39.960
Anne picked me to
be a Rockin' Red Star.

1:00:42.230 --> 1:00:44.130
- Why did you leave me?
- I love you.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:45.670
I hope you get picked.

1:00:45.670 --> 1:00:48.040
[all laughing]

1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:49.240
Eddie.

1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:50.570
Oh-ho-ho.

1:00:50.580 --> 1:00:51.940
You're going down.

1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:53.110
Thank you.

1:00:53.580 --> 1:00:54.680
Whoo!

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:56.080
Hilda.

1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:57.810
Oh!

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:00.520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Thank you.

1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:03.490
- Welcome to the Rockin' Red Stars.
- [Hilda] Oh, my God.

1:01:03.490 --> 1:01:08.360
Hector and Deneise, unfortunately,
you are the two bottom recruits.

1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:12.460
[Anne] You guys each had some
successes on your plates today,

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:17.300
but you guys also had a lot
of difficulty getting to the end.

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:21.070
We can see that there is a
inner cook wanting to come out,

1:01:21.070 --> 1:01:26.040
but this is a fast and furious
place and you gotta learn quickly.

1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:29.550
[Deneise]
<i>Being in the bottom is sad.</i>

1:01:29.550 --> 1:01:32.250
I feel like the lobster.

1:01:32.250 --> 1:01:33.980
<i>[Hector] I'm scared right now,
I'm nervous.</i>

1:01:33.990 --> 1:01:38.590
Bianca's gonna be super upset
at me for going home now.

1:01:38.590 --> 1:01:40.260
She will never forgive me.

1:01:40.260 --> 1:01:42.230
Anne and I have decided that...

1:01:42.230 --> 1:01:43.230
Oh, my God.

1:01:43.230 --> 1:01:46.500
<i>Hector's leaving me here alone.</i>

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:48.730
It's just too soon to
send anyone home.

1:01:48.730 --> 1:01:50.930
[all cheering]

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:55.140
Whoa!

1:01:55.140 --> 1:01:56.840
I was...

1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:00.540
There will be
no elimination this week.

1:02:00.550 --> 1:02:04.180
That means, Hector,
welcome to the red team.

1:02:04.550 --> 1:02:06.220
[laughs] Yay!

1:02:06.220 --> 1:02:07.780
Deneise, come on home.

1:02:09.550 --> 1:02:10.750
I'm staying, yes!

1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:13.460
Another chance. Whoa!

1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:15.130
Chef Cliff, I'm coming for you.

1:02:15.130 --> 1:02:16.560
[laughing]

1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:19.030
Congratulations, recruits.

1:02:19.030 --> 1:02:22.000
You guys made it through
your first week of boot camp.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.270
Anne I have a lot more
to teach you,

1:02:24.270 --> 1:02:26.840
and it's only gonna get more
challenging from this point on,

1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:28.810
because next week
you're really gonna need

1:02:28.810 --> 1:02:30.410
to show us your strengths
in the kitchen.

1:02:32.410 --> 1:02:35.080
<i>[narrator] Next time on
Worst Cooks in America...</i>

1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:38.420
Who has what it takes to
be the next culinary warrior.

1:02:38.420 --> 1:02:40.050
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

1:02:40.050 --> 1:02:45.190
It is the Colosseum, a full
hand-on-hand combat battlefield. [bleep]

1:02:45.190 --> 1:02:47.760
It turned into a melee.

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:49.460
Oh!

1:02:49.460 --> 1:02:54.330
[Anne] Cliff and I are going to teach you
guys a dish that is bursting with flavor.

1:02:54.330 --> 1:02:55.470
Hilda, why is it smoking?

1:02:55.470 --> 1:02:56.600
Whoa!

1:02:56.600 --> 1:02:57.770
This is unexpected.

1:02:57.770 --> 1:02:59.200
Why is fire coming out of it?

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:00.400
That escalated quickly.
