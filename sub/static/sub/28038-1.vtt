52:36.206 --> 52:41.206
[LAUGHS] Rick is not

52:43.310 --> 52:45.275
Told me a few things
about you, though.

52:46.241 --> 52:48.172
STEVE: Really, like what?

52:49.724 --> 52:51.551
That's not for

thinks he knows me.

52:56.862 --> 52:57.655
He doesn't.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.240

and how it's really
great and you just have

is it really great? [LAUGHS]

I mean, am I just,

I mean, I felt so good [LAUGHS],

57:07.068 --> 57:08.862

was that I'm not good enough.
