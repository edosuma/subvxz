00:31.165 --> 00:34.538
They say beauty
is in the eye of the beholder.

00:34.568 --> 00:38.442
They also say that beauty
comes from within.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.412
When I was a little girl,
I used to turn on the television loud

00:41.442 --> 00:43.814
to block out the noise around me.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.583
We didn't have cable, but...

00:45.613 --> 00:49.382
the sound of static
was better than the screaming.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.757
It all started with me being raised
by my single mother.

00:53.787 --> 00:59.459
She always thought of herself
as this beautiful, Haitian queen.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.501
I'm not gonna do this shit with you.
What're you gonna do, huh?

01:04.532 --> 01:07.767
You ain't nothin'
but a bitch of a man!

01:10.538 --> 01:13.744
- I'm not afraid of you!
- You want to fight me like a man?

01:13.774 --> 01:17.210
I'll treat your motherfuckin' ass
like I want.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.646
Don't move!

01:22.216 --> 01:25.323
Bitch, you lucky I didn't
break your motherfucking jaw.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.654
Stupid bitch.

01:27.855 --> 01:31.191
Fuck you.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.636
I'm sorry, baby.

01:38.666 --> 01:42.440
Your mother is a beautiful woman

01:42.470 --> 01:45.309
but I hope to God
you don't grow up

01:45.339 --> 01:46.510
to be like her.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.809
You motherfucker!

01:57.485 --> 02:01.454
I guess when beauty
doesn't come from within...

02:02.590 --> 02:06.426
...you can call that...

02:08.196 --> 02:12.199
...chaos.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.757
My name is Grace

02:33.787 --> 02:38.558
and this is my beautiful life.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.840
The problem is I never thought
I was beautiful,

02:49.870 --> 02:53.344
nor did I ever
feel beautiful inside.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.846
I used to ask God, "why did he
have to make me a girl

02:55.876 --> 02:59.517
"to even have to care
about beauty?"

02:59.547 --> 03:01.652
Now I just ask God,

03:01.682 --> 03:05.184
"why should I care
about anything at all?"

03:28.576 --> 03:31.444
Best friends forever! Dink!

04:43.384 --> 04:46.386
You ready?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.626
You and that damn mouse.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.691
That thing needs
to hurry up and die.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.667
I know, I shouldn't
be talking about

04:56.697 --> 04:59.799
your little friend
like that.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.405
Is that how
you're going to school?

05:07.708 --> 05:10.681
Aren't you excited
about your first day

05:10.711 --> 05:14.381
of your senior year?

05:17.851 --> 05:20.391
You need to move on
with your life, Grace.

05:20.421 --> 05:24.591
We come into this world alone...

05:24.658 --> 05:28.695
and we leave alone.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.536
Girl, do you hear me
talking to you?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.671
Yes, I hear you.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.673
Good.

05:35.703 --> 05:39.539
I'm working late tonight.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.642
And then I got a date,

05:43.811 --> 05:46.484
so dinner's on you.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.449
Bye.

05:54.588 --> 05:58.429
I was always told my name,
Grace, meant something.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.031
That eventually my name
would remind me of who I am

06:01.061 --> 06:05.865
and what I would need in order
to survive in this world.

06:08.602 --> 06:13.440
But I never imagined
my senior year to be like this.

06:20.047 --> 06:24.050
Alone.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.437
I go where I want to

06:39.467 --> 06:41.805
Oh, oh

06:41.835 --> 06:44.775
When I'm with you

06:44.805 --> 06:47.811
I smile and I know

06:47.841 --> 06:50.681
It'll be okay

06:50.711 --> 06:53.617
'Cause I can fly away

06:53.647 --> 06:56.554
Oh, oh, oh

06:56.584 --> 06:58.456
Oh, oh, oh

06:58.486 --> 07:01.654
Oh, oh, oh...

07:22.009 --> 07:25.516
In this beautiful life,
I'm starting to think

07:25.546 --> 07:27.818
that people take themselves
too serious.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.921
It's like all they care about
is who they hang out with,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.724
how they look
or who has the latest iPhone

07:33.754 --> 07:35.793
or newest pair of Jordans.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.661
It's all about...

07:37.691 --> 07:39.129
being...

07:39.159 --> 07:40.230
cool.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.765
But inside...

07:41.795 --> 07:44.835
I bet they feel like shit.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.169
If people were to walk around

07:46.199 --> 07:49.840
the way they actually felt inside?

07:49.870 --> 07:51.642
I'll bet we'd all just be

07:51.672 --> 07:53.877
a bunch of dead zombies
walking this earth.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.746
Welcome back, students!

07:55.776 --> 07:57.881
Hopefully, everyone had
an amazing summer

07:57.911 --> 07:59.617
spending time with loved ones.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.685
I want you all to think
seriously about college.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.588
College education is the
surest way to a better life.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.057
On a more serious note,
I'm sure that you're aware

08:07.087 --> 08:09.793
that we experienced tragedy
over the summer

08:09.823 --> 08:11.161
with one of our students.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.897
May I remind you that we have

08:13.927 --> 08:15.999
a "zero tolerance
for bullying" policy.

08:16.029 --> 08:19.069
Everyone, please respect
and support one another.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.571
We're here to help.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.706
Here's to an amazing first day

08:22.736 --> 08:24.842
and a stellar coming year.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.807
Go, Admirals!

08:48.762 --> 08:50.868
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're seniors now?

08:50.898 --> 08:54.137
This is so exciting!
I am so excited for prom.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.040
Remember when we were ninth graders,
and they used to call us scrubs...

08:57.070 --> 08:58.976
Grace:
Regardless of what

08:59.006 --> 09:01.912
other people's opinions are of others,

09:01.942 --> 09:04.615
I could say I got to witness

09:04.645 --> 09:09.682
what real beauty looks like
from the inside and out.

09:13.020 --> 09:17.690
I just wish she would have known.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.664
Welcome, seniors.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.962
My name...

09:26.634 --> 09:27.905
is Mr. Walsh.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.308
I am your Honors English
teacher this year.

09:31.338 --> 09:35.212
Before any of you determine
whether or not you like me

09:35.242 --> 09:38.749
or anyone else in this class,
let's take a moment

09:38.779 --> 09:41.981
to properly introduce
ourselves, shall we?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.857
Starting with you.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.640
Ms. Weathers?

10:09.810 --> 10:13.050
Let's see here,
you and your daughter...

10:13.080 --> 10:16.315
Ms. Weathers.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.886
Did you understand that,
Ms. Weathers?

10:21.855 --> 10:25.658
Yup. Makes sense.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.865
I bet.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.967
You know, I just, uh...

10:29.997 --> 10:32.799
I just need a little help,
that's all.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.837
If I have to call Obama
myself...

10:38.371 --> 10:40.110
Tell you what.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.780
Why don't you come back
next week like we discussed,

10:42.810 --> 10:43.981
bring all the paperwork,

10:44.011 --> 10:47.914
and, uh, we'll see
what we can work out.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.884
Sounds real good.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.763
You mind if I ask you a question?

10:59.793 --> 11:02.094
Uh, sure, go ahead.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.031
How old are you?

11:06.433 --> 11:09.268
Old enough.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.773
That's all that matters.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.353
Take care.

11:23.383 --> 11:27.791
Please allow me to introduce you
to Mr. Matthew Clifton,

11:27.821 --> 11:29.259
our teacher's aide.

11:29.289 --> 11:33.159
Now, please fill out
the information sheets.

11:33.827 --> 11:38.201
And remember,
this is a very important year.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.138
So please work hard.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.472
I'm gonna need
your cooperation

11:42.502 --> 11:44.842
and, of course,
the support of your parents.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.377
So don't even think about putting

11:47.407 --> 11:50.213
any fake information down
for your parents.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.750
I will find them.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.785
Okay?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.987
When you're completed
with the forms,

11:57.017 --> 12:00.019
please pass them
up to the front.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.762
Excuse me.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.096
Hey, Grace!

12:06.126 --> 12:09.132
What's up?
How are you?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.998
How you doing?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.472
What are you doing here?

12:15.502 --> 12:19.076
Uh, yeah, I know
I look like a loser, huh?

12:19.106 --> 12:20.343
No, um...

12:20.373 --> 12:23.113
I didn't have enough money
to go to Emerson this year.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.481
So I decided to stay here,

12:24.511 --> 12:27.284
you know, work at the school, make
some extra funds, and, you know.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.953
And, uh, save up for next year.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.919
You look good.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.794
It was a long summer, huh?

12:43.230 --> 12:46.933
One, two, three...

12:49.369 --> 12:51.008
I almost sharted on myself.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.111
Matt, stop. That's disgusting.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.213
Whatever, girl, you know you're
gonna miss me when I'm gone.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.215
You gonna miss me
when I'm gone, too.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.017
No, we're not.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.285
That's a lie, actually.
I'm gonna miss those rides

13:02.315 --> 13:04.021
home from school,
but that's about it.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.123
Yeah well, as long
as you takin' care

13:06.153 --> 13:09.827
of our little Gracie,
here, you're good.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.424
Grace needs to take care of me.

13:12.492 --> 13:16.362
What do you mean by that?

13:16.396 --> 13:20.166
You guys are stupid.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.872
How you holding up?

13:34.114 --> 13:37.349
It was good seeing you, Grace.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.566
All right, Jason,
since you're a senior

14:23.596 --> 14:25.235
and a transfer student,
I want to make sure you go

14:25.265 --> 14:26.603
to the counseling center.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.006
And over here is the auditorium,

14:29.036 --> 14:30.540
and then over there
is the cafeteria.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.639
Mr. Walsh!

14:35.976 --> 14:37.214
Let me talk to you.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.583
- Yo. Who's that cutie?
- Man, that's Grace.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.153
She won't be cheering
for us, boy.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.287
What you mean?

14:44.317 --> 14:47.419
She on the other team.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.624
Other team?

15:00.267 --> 15:03.640
That new boy
in school, Jason?

15:03.670 --> 15:07.006
Super hot.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.615
I love that song.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.181
We used to sing that song
all the time.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.221
That was like old times.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.021
Y'all used to skip lunch.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.261
Yeah.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.230
That was like old times.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.000
Thanks for the ride.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.668
Yeah. Of course.

15:31.698 --> 15:36.568
Yeah, you know,
Andrea would want it like that.

15:37.470 --> 15:44.381
Matt, it'll never be like old times.
Why would you say that, Grace?

15:44.411 --> 15:48.285
It's like, all summer you ignore me.
And now, you know, I come back

15:48.315 --> 15:50.087
and you're cold to me
for no reason.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.489
- Like, why are you--
- Matt. Matt. Just stop.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.154
Please.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.529
I'll talk to you later, Matt.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.642
It's true.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.477
People like to forget
the past

16:14.507 --> 16:17.247
that has affected them
the most.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.546
But I could never forget.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.755
It's okay, girl.
I know I'm beautiful.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.225
Jesus told me so,
because that's my homeboy.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.293
Holla. Okay?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.794
But your mom? Oh, my gosh.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.364
She's, like, the black version
of Marilyn Monroe,

16:34.394 --> 16:37.296
and that's true beauty.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.567
You ever wish you could look
like her when you grow older?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.058
Okay.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.439
Here's your coffee.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.275
You've got your cups
right there.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.506
Hey. I'll be right with you.

17:25.311 --> 17:28.780
Grace, what are you doing here?
I told you I was working late.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.394
Shit.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.728
I asked them
for an extension.

17:38.758 --> 17:43.095
- Damn it.
- I'm hungry.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.469
Just go over there
and sit down.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.635
I'll get you something
to eat. God.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.611
Fuck you! Douche bag!

18:28.708 --> 18:32.411
I know who you are.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.614
It's Grace, right?

18:35.915 --> 18:39.518
You were my sister's
best friend.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.888
How'd you know?

18:43.490 --> 18:44.794
She sent me
a bunch of letters

18:44.824 --> 18:47.497
with pictures
of you guys in 'em.

18:47.527 --> 18:51.797
She said you were
her "new sister."

18:53.266 --> 18:56.202
How come you weren't
at the funeral?

18:58.205 --> 19:03.475
I mean, if I had a best friend
that died, I'd be at her funeral.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.516
I'm sorry,
did I just

19:06.546 --> 19:07.784
invite myself
to your dinner?

19:07.814 --> 19:11.750
Oh, it's-- It's fine.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.754
That was really sweet of you.

19:16.623 --> 19:20.792
My grandmother said
you're a really sweet girl.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.331
How's she doing?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.373
Well, she stopped talking.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.738
She's getting more ill.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.979
But that's why I'm down here
to take care of her.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.946
You know? It's the least
I could do.

19:44.717 --> 19:48.186
I see you made a friend.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.537
- Share, this is Lisa.
- She means her mother.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.506
Oh, nice
to meet you, ma'am.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.543
Nice to meet you, too,
but please call me Miss Lisa.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.745
Miss Lisa.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.849
I'm, um,
Andrea's big sister.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.947
Andrea?

20:16.383 --> 20:22.883
Rest her soul,
she was a lovely young lady.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.662
Yeah, she was.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.997
Grace, I'm getting off.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.596
I'll meet you outside
in 15 minutes.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.475
So we should probably
exchange numbers

20:38.505 --> 20:40.377
and hang out, you know?

20:40.407 --> 20:44.009
Just get to know each other.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.688
- Butch, I need some help.
- What's up, baby?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.556
I'm a little strapped
for cash.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.924
What can you do for me?

20:54.954 --> 20:57.059
Oh, what do you mean?
What kind of cash?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.861
How much you need?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.764
I need just a couple hundred.
Can you help a girl out?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.933
"Just a couple of hundred."

21:03.963 --> 21:06.736
You know I'm good for it.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.672
Come on.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.609
- Please?
- All right, baby doll.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.945
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Butch.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.080
- Take the whole thing.
- Really?

21:18.110 --> 21:22.314
- Well, yeah.
- Thank you.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.931
All right.
I'm gonna make sure

21:34.961 --> 21:38.764
that the lights are turned on
by the morning.

21:39.399 --> 21:43.569
Girl, you can tough it out
for one ni-- Are you?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.377
Don't be rolling
your eyes at me.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.711
And you know,
if I don't come home,

21:49.741 --> 21:52.678
that means Chad and I
had a good time!

22:03.556 --> 22:05.691
I miss you, Lisa.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.528
Is that right?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.469
Damn.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.666
You're so beautiful.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.873
Let's get a hotel tonight.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.384
Now, Chad, you know

22:27.414 --> 22:30.152
I ain't no hooker.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.051
Nor am I cheap.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.025
You know I love you, girl.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.960
If you think
all these compliments

22:37.990 --> 22:40.663
is gonna get you some ass,

22:40.693 --> 22:43.629
you better open your wallet.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.536
I mean, I'm just glad
you decided

22:46.566 --> 22:47.904
to come see me tonight.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.672
Well, any woman
who would pass up

22:49.702 --> 22:54.840
on a seafood dinner
is a dummy.

23:01.648 --> 23:04.550
Lisa.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.819
Let's get back together.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.693
Chad, you know that
ain't gonna happen.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.894
Why not?

23:11.924 --> 23:14.163
Because you ain't ready
for a relationship.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.765
Yes, I am.

23:15.795 --> 23:19.465
Chad, please.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.504
You know I love you.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.708
And the sex...

23:35.715 --> 23:39.518
The sex is real good.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.862
But I can't keep going
back and forth

23:45.892 --> 23:47.764
with you and your bullshit.

23:47.794 --> 23:51.563
- Bullshit?
- Yeah. Bullshit.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.037
Why don't you answer it?

23:55.067 --> 23:56.839
Because it's not important.

23:56.869 --> 24:01.106
Tell your wife I said hi.
How are the kids?

24:01.542 --> 24:03.713
I am in the process
of getting a divorce--

24:03.743 --> 24:05.047
I'm not buying that.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.883
- Just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.551
- It's my damn mouth.
- We're trying to eat here.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.786
Then you eat, bitch!

24:09.816 --> 24:13.485
- Lisa, stop.
- Fuck you!

24:29.836 --> 24:33.605
Grace?

24:34.874 --> 24:38.109
Gra-- Grace?

24:40.780 --> 24:41.884
What?

24:41.914 --> 24:45.050
I can't sleep.

24:50.056 --> 24:55.131
Don't ever trust a man.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.796
Ever.

24:58.931 --> 25:03.068
Your father was the first man
that taught me that.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.598
I want you all to write
a poem about yourselves.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.300
Everything about yourself
that's important,

25:31.330 --> 25:32.835
write it down.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.303
What if there's
nothing important?

25:34.333 --> 25:37.306
Then write down what
"nothing important" feels like.

25:37.336 --> 25:40.843
Listen, guys.
It's not that complicated.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.245
It's just a poem.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.111
Okay?

25:55.254 --> 25:59.591
Grace, can I speak
to you?

26:04.096 --> 26:07.937
So, I hear you're smart.

26:07.967 --> 26:11.608
Smart?

26:11.638 --> 26:14.977
How do you figure that?

26:15.007 --> 26:17.943
I have connections.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.717
When you filled out
the information sheets,

26:20.747 --> 26:22.800
you were the only one
who didn't fill out

26:22.830 --> 26:24.987
information about their parents.

26:25.017 --> 26:28.691
That kind of stood out, so...

26:28.721 --> 26:30.856
I did my own research.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.930
Is that legal?

26:33.960 --> 26:36.232
When it pertains
to your education, it is.

26:36.262 --> 26:41.037
I see you got
a 1539 SAT score.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.936
And I also hear
you want to be a writer.

26:45.004 --> 26:48.077
That's pretty impressive.

26:48.107 --> 26:51.047
What colleges
have you applied to?

26:51.077 --> 26:55.213
Actually,
I'm not going to college.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.751
And why is that?

27:02.088 --> 27:04.894
So we have to go
to the same college.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.428
Yes, we have to.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.064
You're smarter than me,
so hopefully

27:08.094 --> 27:09.431
we get into
the same college.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.734
Don't say that.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.770
Or if we don't get
into the same school,

27:13.800 --> 27:18.436
we can stay behind
and be strippers.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.809
Imagine that.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.178
Or we could just
live with my sister.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.813
She would love that.

27:23.843 --> 27:28.847
Either way, we're gonna
be together forever.

27:42.494 --> 27:47.733
How about I've already
made my decision?

27:48.801 --> 27:50.372
So, Grace?

27:50.402 --> 27:52.909
You're really planning on not
going to college anymore?

27:52.939 --> 27:54.877
I mean, that doesn't make
any sense.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.879
Well, you're not.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.315
Grace? Listen.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.818
I'm really sorry
about your friend Andrea.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.152
It must be really hard
for you not to have

28:03.182 --> 28:05.087
your best friend
around anymore.

28:05.117 --> 28:08.991
You guys were... really
connected at the hip.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.093
- Aw!
- Mary, knock it off.

28:11.123 --> 28:14.831
Matt? Get a life.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.866
You're not even
supposed to be here.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.234
Or in this conversation.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.402
Yeah, dude.
Get your shit together.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.105
Aren't you supposed
to be in college or something?

28:23.135 --> 28:26.108
- Yeah, don't worry about me.
- I'm afraid I am.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.944
Seems like someone here
is obsessed

28:27.974 --> 28:30.408
with our little Miss Grace.

28:31.110 --> 28:34.112
Like I was saying...

28:35.214 --> 28:37.319
I know you think
I had something to do with it.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.356
- But I didn't.
- Well, if you didn't

28:40.386 --> 28:43.721
then why did you even
have to say that?

28:44.090 --> 28:47.529
Because I know you think
I had something to do with it.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.229
And she had nothing
to do with it.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.270
Preach.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.872
It's okay, Grace.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.274
You'll find yourself
another girlfriend.

28:58.304 --> 29:02.908
There are plenty of lesbians
at our school.

29:10.182 --> 29:13.852
She's such a bitch.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.427
Hey, Granny.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.940
Okay.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.309
Let's see.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.476
This beautiful life I live.

30:07.506 --> 30:11.447
This beautiful life I live
with tears I cry from inside

30:11.477 --> 30:15.546
and the misery
of my only reproducing pain.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.332
Let me call you back.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.077
Can I help you?

30:41.107 --> 30:42.244
Hi, Miss Lisa.

30:42.274 --> 30:45.181
I, uh--, I was coming
to pick up Grace

30:45.211 --> 30:46.916
to hang out
for the night.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.250
- On a school night?
- Well, not--

30:48.280 --> 30:49.919
I wasn't gonna
keep her out late.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.187
I just...

30:51.217 --> 30:53.122
I've been really lonely,

30:53.152 --> 30:58.456
- and so I was hoping--
- Grace.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.960
Grace!

31:15.041 --> 31:16.278
You two have fun.

31:16.308 --> 31:19.015
- Okay.
- And be safe.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.183
- Yes.
- Bye, Lisa.

31:21.213 --> 31:25.016
- Sharon?
- Oh, it's Share.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.156
You ain't no lesbian,
are you?

31:27.186 --> 31:31.127
Oh, no. No.
I'm-- I'm far from that.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.429
Good, 'cause Grace here

31:33.459 --> 31:37.595
needs to meet some boys
and have some fun.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.706
If you know what I mean.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.939
Yeah.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.411
Bye.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.577
Yeah, I know what you mean.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.514
Oh. Keys.

32:05.224 --> 32:09.027
Yo, your mom was hilarious.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.369
What language was that
she was speaking?

32:13.399 --> 32:15.437
Uh, she's Haitian.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.274
Oh, y'all Haitian?

32:18.304 --> 32:21.143
- Yeah.
- Wow.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.442
Wow, that's crazy.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.680
How come you didn't call
your mom "Mom"?

32:30.682 --> 32:32.754
'Cause-- I don't know.

32:32.784 --> 32:36.721
She never really felt
like a mom.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.428
Thank you
for hanging out with me.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.597
I know it's kind of random,
me calling you.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.266
But you know,
I really did need

32:44.296 --> 32:46.235
someone to hang out with.

32:46.265 --> 32:49.267
It-- It's okay.

32:50.069 --> 32:54.372
Okay, so, let's get out
of the car.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.691
Why'd you park
right over there?

33:09.721 --> 33:11.360
I-- I don't want them
to see the car.

33:11.390 --> 33:15.160
They have, like,
cameras and shit.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.769
So I'm just hoping
that he's not lying,

33:20.799 --> 33:22.771
'cause if he's lying,
I'm gonna be really pissed off.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.340
It's not like
I can be mad if he's lying

33:24.370 --> 33:28.377
because we're not "together
together," But still--

33:28.407 --> 33:29.711
- Hello?
- What's that?

33:29.741 --> 33:32.210
Hold up.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.749
Get off your phone.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.717
Well, I guess you win
that pot.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.686
- Okay, I--
- Didn't I say to get off the phone?

33:37.716 --> 33:40.056
What, you can't listen
or something?

33:40.086 --> 33:42.320
They're gonna hear us out here.
It's gonna--

33:44.323 --> 33:47.463
Hi, Billy.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.098
Share, what are you
doing here?

33:49.128 --> 33:50.699
I...

33:50.729 --> 33:53.735
So you weren't lying?

33:53.765 --> 33:56.534
Hi.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.508
Uh, what are you doing here?

33:59.538 --> 34:02.744
I knew that you guys
were having a guys' night,

34:02.774 --> 34:05.314
but I was in the area,
and so I just wanted to say hi.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.782
Well, you--

34:06.812 --> 34:09.717
you can't just show up
like this, all right?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.420
You're just gonna
stand there?

34:11.449 --> 34:12.621
I'm okay.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.223
- Just sit down, Grace.
- Sit down.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.326
What? I'm just trying to get
back to normal.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.328
I've been really sad

34:19.358 --> 34:22.827
and you make me
really happy.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.404
Do you have any drugs?

34:28.434 --> 34:30.139
Come sit down.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.141
What's your name again?

34:32.170 --> 34:33.574
- Grace.
- Grace.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.411
- You smoke?
- Grace, huh?

34:35.440 --> 34:37.413
Grace, that's a pretty name.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.581
Yeah, how old are you?

34:39.610 --> 34:44.186
- I'm 17.
- Nice.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.254
- Yeah.
- Cool.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.553
I'm Rod.

34:49.355 --> 34:50.826
Lisa.

34:50.856 --> 34:55.360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's off-limits.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.433
You want a drink?

34:57.463 --> 35:00.336
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Why not?

35:00.366 --> 35:02.504
Because I'm not thirsty.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.506
Oh.

35:04.536 --> 35:08.173
Well, I am definitely
thirsty.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.479
I said I'm thirsty.

35:10.509 --> 35:14.183
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you. Appreciate that.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.147
Oh.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.522
Mr. Bartender,
bartending at the table.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.759
Are you going to share that?

35:23.789 --> 35:25.594
Well, I'm thinking
this is the real reason

35:25.624 --> 35:28.464
- you came over here.
- No.

35:28.494 --> 35:31.729
I came to see you.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.540
Grace?

35:38.570 --> 35:40.576
Oh, I'm-- I'm all right.

35:40.606 --> 35:45.176
Yeah, I know. Drugs are bad.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.679
So am I.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.850
Change.

36:03.762 --> 36:07.203
You have to breathe it
in slow.

36:07.233 --> 36:10.601
You're only gonna get
more high like that.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.477
You're funny. It's okay.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.643
It happened to me the first time
I did it with my sister.

36:25.717 --> 36:31.456
- Who's that texting you?
- Just a friend.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.877
- So, did you have fun?
- I mean, if you call

36:48.907 --> 36:51.513
watching you and your boyfriend
make out "fun."

36:51.543 --> 36:55.917
Gosh, he's not my boyfriend.
He's more like my drug.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.583
For now.

36:59.751 --> 37:03.292
You know, I can see why you
and my sister hung out.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.723
You're really cool.

37:08.894 --> 37:12.330
Thanks.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.742
Five, six, seven, eight.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.744
Work, work, work
that cherry.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.646
Work it to the beat.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.682
Now pop, pop,
pop that cherry.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.350
Make it feel sweet.

37:28.380 --> 37:32.621
Now drop, drop that cherry.
Don't you want to eat, eat?

37:32.651 --> 37:34.823
Now pop, pop,
pop that cherry.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.625
Make it feel sweet.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.627
Now drop,
drop that cherry.

37:38.657 --> 37:42.598
Don't you want
to eat, eat, eat?

37:42.628 --> 37:45.430
Don't you want to eat?

37:52.471 --> 37:54.376
This ain't workin'. I don't
like it. Something's wrong.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.412
- And it's you. It's her.
- What?

37:56.442 --> 37:58.500
-What? -You're messing up.
You're not even committing.

37:58.530 --> 38:01.683
- Fine. Okay. Okay!
- Fine? No. "Okay. Okay. Okay!"

38:01.713 --> 38:03.652
- Commit, bitch. Commit.
- Okay.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.053
This ain't no game.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.723
Grace! Grace!

38:07.753 --> 38:10.588
Grace, right?

38:12.691 --> 38:14.396
Yeah, you.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.997
- Shit.
- I didn't like it.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.699
Don't be huffin' and puffin'.
It's her.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.502
- How do you know my name?
- Um...

38:20.532 --> 38:22.671
it's not hard
to find out someone's name

38:22.701 --> 38:25.441
that you're interested in.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.905
I'm Jason.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.014
What is he doing
talking to her?

38:33.044 --> 38:35.351
Not to be mean or anything,

38:35.381 --> 38:37.619
but you kind of suck
out there.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.621
Thanks.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.625
I was just jokin'.
You're supposed to laugh.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.792
Well, I guess
I'll-- I'll see you around.

38:51.563 --> 38:55.937
Yo. Is that girl really weird
like everybody say she is?

38:55.967 --> 38:58.740
- Who, Grace?
- Yeah.

38:58.770 --> 39:02.711
Bro, you can't tell?
She's, like, really weird.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.045
Weird? She's cute as hell.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.047
Yo, you guys really need
to know the facts

39:06.077 --> 39:07.649
before you start talking
about people.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.651
Matt, I know
that's your friend and all,

39:09.681 --> 39:11.453
but you know the truth.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.655
Yo, Anthony, I'd be quiet
if I were you, all right?

39:13.685 --> 39:15.991
Wait, wait,
what're y'all talkin' about?

39:16.021 --> 39:18.560
Look, she was already weird.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.463
But last summer,
her girlfriend killed herself,

39:21.493 --> 39:22.698
and now she's weirder.

39:22.728 --> 39:23.965
Yo, that wasn't
her girlfriend.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.701
That was her best friend,
all right?

39:25.731 --> 39:28.766
What you gonna do
about it?

39:29.067 --> 39:32.903
I'm just saying
what everybody already knows.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.879
Really?

39:37.909 --> 39:39.881
You don't go here
anymore, Matt.

39:39.911 --> 39:43.781
You're not a senior anymore.
Remember?

39:45.784 --> 39:48.419
Yeah, I remember.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.460
I'mma act
like I didn't see that.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.629
Why don't you get out of here
and stop talkin' all that shit?

39:53.659 --> 39:55.963
Why don't you get the fuck out
of here and stop talkin'

39:55.993 --> 39:57.599
- all that shit.
- Wow.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.697
Um...

39:59.765 --> 40:01.803
Yeah.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.540
They say you're really close
with Grace.

40:04.570 --> 40:09.511
Is that stuff they say
about her, is it real?

40:09.541 --> 40:10.946
If you want
to get to know her,

40:10.976 --> 40:12.881
why don't you get to know her
for yourself

40:12.911 --> 40:16.113
and stop listening
to these knuckleheads?

40:27.826 --> 40:30.566
Hey, Jerry.
Hold on for a second.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.501
Hey, ma'am, you can't smoke
in here.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.965
Oh.

40:35.734 --> 40:38.707
Thank you.
Jerry? Hey, buddy.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.709
Yeah, hold
that appointment for me.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.579
Okay, thanks.

40:43.609 --> 40:49.547
So am I, uh... am I gonna
get the food stamps?

40:49.815 --> 40:54.523
Looks like
you are gonna qualify.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.825
Yay.

40:56.855 --> 40:59.895
Um, you're-- You're not
gonna get the max

40:59.925 --> 41:01.563
because it's just you
and your daughter.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.064
But you should be receiving
something

41:03.094 --> 41:05.100
- really shortly in the mail.
- Okay.

41:05.130 --> 41:09.270
So, I have some forms
I need you to sign.

41:09.300 --> 41:14.739
Right here.
Go ahead and date it.

41:25.684 --> 41:30.220
Wait, is that right?

41:32.591 --> 41:35.860
Every digit.

41:38.263 --> 41:41.065
All right,
I'mma call you.

41:42.868 --> 41:45.803
Good to see you.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.806
Take care.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.694
In this beautiful life
do we fight

42:05.724 --> 42:08.897
the vultures that attempt
to kill beauty

42:08.927 --> 42:12.029
or die as they prey
upon us?

42:25.677 --> 42:28.817
It's just not fair.

42:28.847 --> 42:31.682
What do you mean
it's not fair?

42:32.217 --> 42:35.223
Everybody's always making fun
of me about everything.

42:35.253 --> 42:38.827
About the way I look,
who I am.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.996
I just feel
like I don't fit in.

42:41.026 --> 42:43.732
Sometimes I wish
I could just disappear.

42:43.762 --> 42:46.001
No. No. Andrea.

42:46.031 --> 42:49.667
Don't-- Don't talk
like that.

42:50.702 --> 42:53.141
What's the point of being here

42:53.171 --> 42:56.273
if no one sees me for me?

42:59.878 --> 43:02.847
I see you for who you are.

43:05.016 --> 43:08.886
I'm your best friend.

43:15.727 --> 43:18.362
Grace, do you think
I'm beautiful?

43:19.097 --> 43:21.036
It's okay.

43:21.066 --> 43:24.869
You can be honest with me.

43:25.336 --> 43:30.174
Yes, I do.
I think you're beautiful.

43:30.408 --> 43:33.277
Do you?

43:58.103 --> 44:01.271
Grace.

44:01.306 --> 44:04.412
Hey, what're you doing?

44:04.442 --> 44:08.416
Um, just finishing
some homework.

44:08.446 --> 44:12.320
Well, looks like we may
be getting some food stamps.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.222
You better thank
the man upstairs,

44:14.252 --> 44:15.924
because otherwise
you'd have to go out

44:15.954 --> 44:17.693
and get a job.

44:17.723 --> 44:21.396
You know, once you turn 18
you're officially an adult

44:21.426 --> 44:23.064
and I officially

44:23.094 --> 44:26.363
don't have to take care
of you no more.

44:27.999 --> 44:31.940
You know, I met
a-- I met a cutie.

44:31.970 --> 44:37.107
He's a little young,
but we'll see.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.443
Mmm.

44:40.879 --> 44:43.384
How was last night?

44:43.414 --> 44:44.986
Cool.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.923
Did you have fun?

44:47.953 --> 44:50.125
Something like that.

44:50.155 --> 44:52.994
And, uh, Sharon...

44:53.024 --> 44:54.996
It's Share.

44:55.026 --> 44:57.132
Share, Sharon.

44:57.162 --> 45:00.898
She looks like she's holding up
with her sister being gone and all.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.972
I guess.

45:04.002 --> 45:08.005
I think it's good that you hang
around with a girl like that.

45:09.240 --> 45:12.380
Her being older, she could be
a good example--

45:12.410 --> 45:14.049
I don't need any examples.

45:14.079 --> 45:17.152
Everybody needs examples.

45:17.182 --> 45:21.156
If-- If something
is broken,

45:21.186 --> 45:23.491
how do you know
how to fix it?

45:23.521 --> 45:26.094
Exampled.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.396
You understand?

45:28.426 --> 45:33.097
You're not the only one
that's smart around here.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.337
What are you writing?

45:36.367 --> 45:39.369
A book? About me?

45:41.840 --> 45:43.945
Hello?

45:43.975 --> 45:46.214
Yeah, no, I'm just...

45:46.244 --> 45:50.218
I'm just doing
some schoolwork.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.153
Yeah. Can I call you back?

45:52.183 --> 45:57.926
- Thanks. Okay.
- Who was that?

45:57.956 --> 46:00.061
Share. She wanted me

46:00.091 --> 46:03.064
to come with her
to look for a job.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.362
You should go.

46:07.232 --> 46:10.300
I have homework.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.173
It's Friday night.

46:12.203 --> 46:14.142
You got all weekend
to do your homework.

46:14.172 --> 46:17.212
Well, I want
to finish it now.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.280
Girl, go have fun.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.082
Do you know what I did
when I was a senior?

46:21.112 --> 46:25.950
Girl, I don't even
wanna tell you.

46:26.517 --> 46:30.320
All I'm saying is you should
go out and have some fun.

46:38.196 --> 46:40.865
All right.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.869
Let's go!

46:46.271 --> 46:48.109
No, thank you.

46:48.139 --> 46:50.407
Come in.

46:52.143 --> 46:56.280
It's a porn shop,
don't be so prude.

47:00.518 --> 47:03.988
Hello!

47:07.592 --> 47:09.526
Ooh.

47:09.961 --> 47:15.432
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for a job.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.169
What kind of job
would that be?

47:19.537 --> 47:22.907
A job like this.

47:23.008 --> 47:25.109
A job.

47:27.245 --> 47:28.416
You ever worked in

47:28.446 --> 47:32.316
the entertainment business
before?

47:32.350 --> 47:34.389
So do I have the job?

47:34.419 --> 47:36.557
She looking for a job, too?

47:36.587 --> 47:42.259
No, only I'm looking
for a job.

47:48.333 --> 47:49.637
Grace.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.306
Grace?

47:51.336 --> 47:52.908
Who's that?

47:52.938 --> 47:54.175
Um...

47:54.205 --> 47:57.212
I knew that looked
like you.

47:57.242 --> 48:01.011
Yep. It's me.

48:01.246 --> 48:04.448
So, um,
what are you guys up to?

48:05.283 --> 48:08.089
Um, just hanging.

48:08.119 --> 48:10.258
- This is...
- Share.

48:10.288 --> 48:13.228
I'm Grace's new
best friend.

48:13.258 --> 48:14.595
Hey, Share.

48:14.625 --> 48:20.664
So what're you guys
up to tonight?

48:21.432 --> 48:24.272
Uh, we're not
doing anything.

48:24.302 --> 48:26.975
What are you doing?

48:27.005 --> 48:28.576
Just got to help my mom.

48:28.606 --> 48:32.576
But after that,
nothing at all.

48:32.610 --> 48:36.413
Well, you should hang out
with us.

48:37.382 --> 48:39.220
Is that cool with you?

48:39.250 --> 48:41.389
Uh, hold on.

48:41.419 --> 48:43.158
Where are we going?

48:43.188 --> 48:44.325
Girl, it's a Friday night.

48:44.355 --> 48:45.693
We can find something to do.

48:45.723 --> 48:49.030
I mean, damn, I got
to teach you kids everything?

48:49.060 --> 48:52.300
Um, I got an idea.
Why don't you

48:52.330 --> 48:55.070
put your number in my phone,

48:55.100 --> 48:57.072
and we'll call you later
and we'll pick you up

48:57.102 --> 48:59.607
and we'll figure out
something to do.

48:59.637 --> 49:02.277
Okay.

49:02.307 --> 49:03.578
- Cool.
- Cool.

49:03.608 --> 49:07.715
So, uh,
I'll see you guys later?

49:07.745 --> 49:09.217
You sure will.

49:09.247 --> 49:11.515
All right, Grace.

49:13.351 --> 49:17.358
Damn, girl.
He wants you.

49:17.388 --> 49:20.390
He flirts with everybody.

49:58.229 --> 50:01.402
I brought you flowers.

50:01.432 --> 50:04.234
And your favorite gin.

50:06.371 --> 50:10.207
I hope you're hungry.

50:24.355 --> 50:27.462
Get out of here!

50:27.492 --> 50:29.464
Get off! Get...

50:29.494 --> 50:31.332
I'm not getting off of nothin'.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.401
Now, look here, now, you're
gonna stop pushing me away,

50:33.431 --> 50:37.301
'cause I'm gonna finish doing
what I'm doing, you hear me?

51:17.675 --> 51:20.277
Hey!

51:20.478 --> 51:23.147
Come on, guys.

51:23.814 --> 51:25.420
Do you even know
anybody here?

51:25.450 --> 51:28.356
Yeah. There's a few
old friends.

51:28.386 --> 51:30.191
Is that Grace?

51:30.221 --> 51:33.428
- Holy shit! Damn, girl!
- Oh! Oh, my God!

51:33.458 --> 51:35.330
- What?
- Oh, my-- You scared me!

51:35.360 --> 51:36.397
You're back? What the--

51:36.427 --> 51:39.263
Oh, God, I would've
punched you.

51:40.631 --> 51:42.137
Shit, let's get a shot!

51:42.167 --> 51:45.302
- Let's get a shot! Whoo!
- Come on!

51:47.438 --> 51:51.241
- Is that Jason?
- That is Jason.

51:51.342 --> 51:53.181
You want to dance?

51:53.211 --> 51:55.812
- Oh...
- Come on.

51:58.349 --> 52:00.455
No worries.

52:00.485 --> 52:02.223
No worries.

52:02.253 --> 52:04.392
Yeah! Ha!

52:04.422 --> 52:06.690
Whoo!

52:43.694 --> 52:46.667
Who is that
that you keep texting?

52:46.697 --> 52:49.604
I promised I wouldn't tell.

52:49.634 --> 52:53.341
Nah. But you tell me
everything.

52:53.371 --> 52:56.306
This I can't.

52:57.575 --> 53:00.215
Do they go to our school?

53:00.245 --> 53:02.483
Maybe.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.620
- Is it a boy?
- Yes.

53:05.650 --> 53:08.452
Okay.

53:21.599 --> 53:23.638
Boo!

53:23.668 --> 53:26.974
I know, I work here now.
It's weird, huh?

53:27.004 --> 53:29.244
Hey, Grace.

53:29.274 --> 53:31.612
Oh, sorry,
did I interrupt something?

53:31.642 --> 53:33.648
- No.
- No, you didn't.

53:33.678 --> 53:37.918
Cool. So, I was wondering

53:37.948 --> 53:40.655
what were your plans
for the weekend?

53:40.685 --> 53:44.400
Um, I don't have
anything planned as of now.

53:44.430 --> 53:45.593
Excellent.

53:45.623 --> 53:48.596
'Cause I was also wondering

53:48.626 --> 53:51.866
if you'd like
to hang out with me.

53:51.896 --> 53:53.768
Maybe.

53:53.798 --> 53:57.467
Cool. So it's a date.

53:57.702 --> 54:01.771
- Okay.
- All right.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.612
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey.

54:04.642 --> 54:07.482
I heard you're going
to that party this weekend.

54:07.512 --> 54:09.517
- I am.
- Great.

54:09.547 --> 54:13.883
I'll see you there.

54:27.332 --> 54:30.605
I got the job!
I got the job!

54:30.635 --> 54:32.440
Oh, my gosh.
Now we can celebrate.

54:32.470 --> 54:34.809
'Cause I can pay
all my freakin' bills!

54:34.839 --> 54:37.412
Share, you know
it's a school night.

54:37.442 --> 54:40.748
Yeah, I know, but we don't have
to leave to celebrate.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.983
Is your mom home?

54:43.013 --> 54:46.421
- She's at work.
- Good, okay.

54:46.451 --> 54:49.624
because that means
that we can, um...

54:49.654 --> 54:51.058
take shots!

54:51.088 --> 54:53.557
Come on, bitch!

55:25.122 --> 55:28.057
You cleaned up?

55:29.627 --> 55:31.732
You hungry?

55:31.762 --> 55:34.898
I'm fine now.

55:38.002 --> 55:39.106
What?

55:39.136 --> 55:42.610
Nothing.
I can look at you all I want.

55:42.640 --> 55:46.080
I made you.

55:46.110 --> 55:48.716
You all right?

55:48.746 --> 55:50.751
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

55:50.781 --> 55:53.950
I'm just asking.

55:54.419 --> 55:58.793
Any cute boys in school?

55:58.823 --> 56:00.528
Lisa, why are
you asking me this?

56:00.558 --> 56:02.697
I think it's time you
start acting like a normal girl.

56:02.727 --> 56:05.929
You mean be more like you.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.982
Wow, this is wild.

56:22.012 --> 56:24.685
That's how they do it
here, huh?

56:24.715 --> 56:27.484
Sure.

56:29.954 --> 56:32.422
Hey.

56:38.496 --> 56:39.700
Hey, Jason.

56:39.730 --> 56:43.037
When you're done with that,
you should come hang with us.

56:43.067 --> 56:46.774
Yeah. Sweet Cherry Crew really
knows how to throw a party.

56:46.804 --> 56:50.740
- Say what?
- Hey.

56:51.141 --> 56:53.814
Mary always needs attention,
doesn't she?

56:53.844 --> 56:57.084
Enough talking about trash.
Please.

56:57.114 --> 57:01.451
I'm happy you came here
with me tonight.

57:01.686 --> 57:03.724
I really like you.

57:03.754 --> 57:06.890
You know that, right?

57:07.825 --> 57:09.864
You want to get
something to drink?

57:09.894 --> 57:13.029
- Uh, sure.
- All right.

57:16.834 --> 57:19.674
- Hey.
- Aww.

57:19.704 --> 57:21.476
You two love birds!

57:21.506 --> 57:23.478
So cute.
Don't worry about me.

57:23.508 --> 57:25.746
I'm gonna make
my own party, okay?

57:25.776 --> 57:28.578
Look how cute he is!

57:30.681 --> 57:32.019
Cheers?

57:32.049 --> 57:34.889
Wait, you have
something on your lip.

57:34.919 --> 57:37.854
Hold on.

57:39.023 --> 57:41.625
It worked, right?

57:43.594 --> 57:46.796
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

57:49.299 --> 57:51.872
Look at Share.

57:51.902 --> 57:54.074
I love that girl.

57:54.104 --> 57:57.545
You know, ever since
I met Share, it's like...

57:57.575 --> 58:00.114
- Yeah, get down! Up, down!
- I feel alive again.

58:00.144 --> 58:01.916
Down! Down! Down! Further!

58:01.946 --> 58:03.784
It's crazy.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.853
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

58:05.883 --> 58:09.553
How do you feel
since you've met me?

58:10.320 --> 58:11.859
I don't know.

58:11.889 --> 58:15.596
I'm still
feeling that out.

58:15.626 --> 58:16.897
Still feeling, huh?

58:16.927 --> 58:21.598
That's a good thing.

58:22.032 --> 58:26.035
- Damn, he's about to get it.
- Shut the fuck up.

58:40.685 --> 58:45.021
You're so different from
the other girls around here.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:47.882
So, when you lost
your virginity,

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:50.980
did it hurt?

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.755
So what you call me
over here for?

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:57.987
Not really.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:03.063
Honestly,
I didn't even like it.

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:07.396
It didn't feel good at all?

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:10.133
No.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.873
I wish it did.

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:17.173
Maybe you should try it.
See if you like it.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.747
Maybe you should have sex
with Matt.

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:22.817
That's gross.
He's like my brother.

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:25.185
Matt would die
if you had sex with him.

01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:28.188
He's, like, so obsessed
with you.

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:32.026
Okay, if I tell you something

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:34.494
you promise not
to tell anyone?

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.130
Promise.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.999
You remember that boy
I told you about at school?

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:40.968
Yes.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.770
You promise not
to tell anyone?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.405
Because if this gets out,
I'm dead.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:49.205
Okay. I promise.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:02.056
Look, remember
what you used to tell me.

01:02:02.086 --> 01:02:04.158
Just keep walking
with your head up high.

01:02:04.188 --> 01:02:05.192
I mean,
none of them matter anyways.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.024
They're all ugly
on the inside.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:14.330
I see you're
walking differently, Grace.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:20.103
Who loses their virginity
on a beach?

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:27.147
Sandy, ashy hoes.

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:29.483
Sandy, ashy hoes!

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:32.887
Sandy, ashy hoes!
Sandy, ashy hoes!

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:34.154
Sandy, ashy hoes!

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:37.153
Sandy, ashy hoes.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.067
It wasn't even like that.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:49.198
You fucking lesbian.

01:02:49.834 --> 01:02:52.206
- Boo-hoo, whore.
- She's so ugly.

01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:54.474
We're not gonna save you,
and no one is.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.376
Do you want to be
a vampire, girl?

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.078
Is that why
you dress that way?

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.213
You look so ugly when you cry.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:00.981
- You nasty.
- Little stanky-ass ho.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:02.349
You're such a lesbian.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:04.051
You need
to fucking die, bitch.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:05.119
Go away.

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:06.486
Nobody wants you here.

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.822
Nobody.

01:03:07.852 --> 01:03:10.219
You're fucking in my space
right now.

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:22.498
Grace!

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:27.871
It's okay.

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:30.210
I mean, if I were you
I would just be happy

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.546
that Jason gave you
attention.

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.614
I'd be a ho for him, too.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.046
Me, three.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.347
How the fuck could you
do this to me?

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:09.583
How could you do this to me?
I'm ruined now!

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.185
Andrea, why do you care
what they say?

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:13.120
Because I promised her!

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:16.219
I care because
I promised Mary!

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.676
You're supposed
to be my best friend!

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.313
How could you do this
to me, Grace?

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:42.311
How c-- How could you?

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:15.349
How could you?

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.551
How could you keep something
like this from me?

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.219
Because you're not being real
with me!

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.255
You're not being real with me!
You're not being real

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:23.023
- with yourself!
- What are you talking about?

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:25.092
- We're best friends!
- Do you want to be with me

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:27.223
or not, Grace?

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:35.069
Do you love me?

01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:37.233
Do you?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.349
I didn't think so.

01:06:26.283 --> 01:06:28.322
I don't know. It just...

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:32.192
It just happened.

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:34.194
What happened?

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:37.131
The fight or the sex?

01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:39.433
The fight.

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:42.569
The sex. Both.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:45.439
You know what, my dear,

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:49.772
that is what you call life.

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:53.080
I just...

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.215
It just happened.

01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:59.086
I mean, how can you do that?

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:01.155
I want to kill him.

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:05.388
I told you about these guys.
I told you that.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:13.200
I'm sorry. I'm not--
I'm not laughing at you.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:17.533
I'm-- I'm laughing with you.
I'm...

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.842
Come on.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.844
You have to laugh
at stuff like this,

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:28.311
or else it's gonna--
it's gonna eat you up.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:31.447
I don't know what to do.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.554
You know what, Grace,
if I had let people judge me,

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:37.557
if I had judged myself for
everything that I did in Vegas,

01:07:37.587 --> 01:07:40.160
I probably would've ended up
going crazy.

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:43.863
I probably would've done
the same thing that Andrea did.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:46.866
Hey, in this life,

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.535
you're alone.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.538
You have to fight
your own battles.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.540
And sometimes

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:57.240
you just gotta
say, "Fuck it."

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.309
Fuck it!

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:07.287
So on that note,
was it good?

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:10.519
- What?
- Was it good, the sex?

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:14.357
You're so silly.

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:15.695
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:17.531
- I can't do it.
- Oh, come on.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.529
You're not doing it right.
It's like this.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:29.205
I just keep saying
how big they are?

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.380
- Oh, my gosh.
- Look! Look!

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:35.549
And if they're,
like, pinky-small,

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:39.519
just say,
"Oh, it's so big, Daddy."

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:40.487
They like that.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:44.520
- Make them want me?
- Make them want you.

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.193
Make them want me?

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.394
Make them want you!

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:50.193
Okay! Make them want me?

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.568
Are you wearing my shirt?

01:08:54.598 --> 01:09:00.403
Um, I was
just borrowing it.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.510
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:08.648
All right,

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:11.880
what do you want
to do tonight?

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.321
Let's go find some boys.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:17.586
Yes! Indeed!

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.733
Um, can we have two Jamesons?

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:30.433
- Yes, you may.
- Thank you.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.741
Come on, let's dance.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:38.478
Let's get ready to get
on the dance floor.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.613
The dance floor. Uh-oh!

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.448
There she goes! Ooh!

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.618
Thank you.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:48.317
To your first night
as an adult.

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:59.728
Whew! Okay, I...

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.441
Hey.

01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:09.243
- How are you?
- Huh?

01:10:09.273 --> 01:10:11.445
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:10:11.475 --> 01:10:13.580
- Patrick.
- Grace.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.282
Nice to meet you, Grace.

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:17.851
How old are you?

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:20.587
- How old am I?
- Yes, how old are you?

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:22.322
I'm 20.

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:24.753
Cool.

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.394
You think I can
take you out sometime?

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:31.465
Um, depends on how long you
can keep my attention tonight.

01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:33.032
Is that right?

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.501
Careful, big boy.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.765
She's well-equipped.

01:11:12.436 --> 01:11:15.371
Baby, come watch TV with me.

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:23.346
Where have you been?

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.719
- Why do you care?
- I said where have you been?

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:27.020
Why do you care?

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:28.722
I've been calling your ass.

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:31.458
Why aren't you answering the phone?
My phone died, sorry.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:33.627
- Your phone died.
- Yes, my phone died.

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:35.795
You can't just come in here
any time you feel like it.

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:38.961
And why can't I?

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:41.468
Listen, I don't have time

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:42.969
- for this right now.
- Grace, I'm ta...

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:45.372
Talk to me, then.
Talk to me, Lisa.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:48.342
Wh-- Oh, you know what?

01:11:48.372 --> 01:11:50.410
Lisa, I got to fucking
wake up in the morning.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.811
- Wait...
- What do you-- what you doing?

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.113
- What are y'all doing?
- O-- Okay. Okay, okay.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.982
You trying to act
like a good mother

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:57.851
'cause your little friend
is here, huh?

01:11:57.881 --> 01:12:00.520
You know what,
you're out of line!

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.921
- Lisa, I'm gonna take off.
- No, that's okay.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.690
Don't go, don't go,
don't go.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.659
- Yeah, don't go, don't go.
- Don't go, don't go.

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:07.961
All right, I'm out of here.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:10.364
You need to stop
drinking so much.

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:12.828
Yeah, whatever.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.804
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't fucking believe it.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.639
Got a girl who's crazy.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.375
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

01:12:21.405 --> 01:12:23.672
What is wrong with you?

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:38.387
I'm tired of you!

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.632
Go. You want to go?

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:47.501
Go.

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:50.466
Bye, Lisa.

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:20.062
Yo, it's too late
to be out here.

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:39.915
All right, let me know if you
need anything else, all right?

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:45.888
You know, Grace,
I'm worried about you.

01:13:53.697 --> 01:13:56.632
About what?

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:03.539
Matt, what do you
want from me?

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:09.778
It seems like
you're obsessed with me.

01:14:11.715 --> 01:14:14.650
It's okay.

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:40.242
Just admit it.

01:14:42.546 --> 01:14:45.648
Just come here, look.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.588
Stop being a creep.

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:50.289
I'm-I'm just a guy
that cares, that's...

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.922
- That's just...
- Don't touch me.

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.000
Listen, Grace,
I kn-- I know

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:04.499
about you and Andrea.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.873
I know, and I-- I'm not
judging about it.

01:15:06.903 --> 01:15:10.038
- But listen, you don't know--
- You don't know shit.

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:14.643
Okay?

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.853
All right.

01:15:19.883 --> 01:15:22.818
Maybe I don't.

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:27.326
You know, listen, Matt.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.795
I appreciate you

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:30.730
and everything you did
for me tonight,

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:35.564
but I'm tired.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.968
Good night.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.812
You know, Grace,
I just didn't

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:49.544
stay back in town because I had the...

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:55.584
Because I didn't have the money,
you know, to go to college.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:16:00.823
I also stayed back in town
to protect you.

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:05.699
You're a very special girl,
you know?

01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:08.664
You mean a lot to me.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:18.745
Yo, where you going?

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:22.882
I'm gonna give you a little
piece of advice, Matt.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.318
Start worrying
about your life.

01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:28.283
Not mine.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.744
Your friend's here.

01:16:50.774 --> 01:16:54.242
What are you doing here?

01:16:55.178 --> 01:16:57.884
I wanted to hang out.

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:59.886
Mm.

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:01.888
Well, there's
nothing to do here, so...

01:17:01.918 --> 01:17:03.890
If she wants to stay,
let her stay.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.388
We just chillin'.

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:11.994
Oh.

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.802
JoJo, why don't you roll up
some of that kale

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:18.366
for the princess?

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.491
You want me?

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:15.457
Huh?

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.172
What's wrong?

01:18:30.874 --> 01:18:32.912
It's Grace.

01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:34.814
She's been acting up.

01:18:34.844 --> 01:18:37.050
I kicked her out of the house
last night

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.085
and I haven't heard from her.

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:41.850
She's gonna be okay, Lisa.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:45.424
I've been a horrible mother.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.027
I've been a horrible mother.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.863
No, you're not.

01:18:49.893 --> 01:18:53.762
You just have to have faith.

01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:15.417
You are a wild one.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.224
What?

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:21.790
I can't even remember
what happened.

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:26.128
Where do you want me
to take you?

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.104
Hey, Grace, what's up?
This is Patrick.

01:20:38.134 --> 01:20:39.572
I had a good time with you
in the club the other night.

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:43.309
Looking forward
to seeing you later. Peace.

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.144
Thank you for dinner.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:47.280
You're welcome.

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:50.249
So where do you want to go?

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:53.081
You want to hang out longer?

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.621
Um...

01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:58.291
Well, my friends are having
a party at the hotel

01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:00.259
right there
if you want to go.

01:21:00.289 --> 01:21:02.461
I mean, we could
stay here if you want.

01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:03.629
Oh.

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:05.932
No, it's... it's totally fine.

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:08.201
I just have school
in the morning.

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:09.268
School?

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:12.138
Uh, yeah, I'm in college.

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:16.104
Oh, okay, cool.

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:21.343
I just want to hang out longer
with you, that's all.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:51.544
- Okay, okay, stop.
- What's wrong?

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:54.547
This is-- This isn't
a good idea.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:57.416
No? I thought you were down.

01:21:57.446 --> 01:22:00.086
You're not down?

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:01.720
Huh?

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.556
Come on, I got you.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.058
I got you.

01:22:05.088 --> 01:22:07.922
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:10.229
What are you do...

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.395
Relax. I know what you want.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.036
Let me go.

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:20.039
- Let m--
- Relax. Just go with it.

01:22:20.069 --> 01:22:22.337
Stop.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.149
Get off me.

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:38.686
Let go of me.

01:22:41.424 --> 01:22:46.194
Fellas, she's right in time
for the party.

01:22:48.131 --> 01:22:49.502
Let go of me.

01:22:49.532 --> 01:22:51.566
Let go!

01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:25.438
Share, it's Grace.

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:27.640
Please call me back.

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.808
Please.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.345
Grace, I know
I wasn't there for you.

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:36.415
My grandmother died.
I'm sorry.

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:41.620
I've just been
trying to figure it out.

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:44.323
But I want to fix it.

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:47.460
I don't think
we should do this.

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:51.659
These guys are gonna pay
for what they did to you.

01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:03.405
Grace! Grace!

01:24:04.307 --> 01:24:07.542
Grace!

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:26.765
Yeah.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:28.601
Come on through this way.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:32.134
Hey, I'm gonna call you
right back. Hold on.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.379
- Oh, shit!
- Get the fuck back!

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.415
Everybody shut the fuck up!

01:24:42.445 --> 01:24:44.617
You think you could rape my little
sister and get away with it?

01:24:44.647 --> 01:24:46.185
Where the fuck is Patrick at?

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:48.816
Where is he?

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:56.529
Oh! Hey! What the fuck?

01:24:56.559 --> 01:25:00.162
- Get out. I said get out!
- Goddamn. Okay.

01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:03.436
Do you remember that girl?
Huh?

01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:05.604
Did you rape her? Huh?

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.406
Tell me right now,
'cause I can fix it.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:09.375
I'll fix-- I'll fucking
shoot them in the fucking face!

01:25:09.405 --> 01:25:10.843
Are those the guys
that raped you?

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:15.310
Tell me right now!
Is that the guy who raped you?

01:25:15.544 --> 01:25:19.614
Are these the guys
that raped you?

01:25:40.203 --> 01:25:43.738
Evelyn, I don't know
where she went.

01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:49.511
I don't know what to do.

01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:56.384
Bring her home safe.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.913
Please bring her home.

01:26:20.943 --> 01:26:23.878
Mom?

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.352
Grace...

01:26:26.382 --> 01:26:29.384
Grace!

01:27:40.623 --> 01:27:43.891
Anyway,
I wanted to give you this.

01:27:44.527 --> 01:27:46.365
What's this?

01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:49.864
Just don't open it
before I leave.

01:27:51.967 --> 01:27:55.474
There's nothing really here
for me anymore, so...

01:27:55.504 --> 01:27:57.872
Oh...

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:00.646
Okay.

01:28:00.676 --> 01:28:03.811
See you later.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:33.846
This beautiful life.

01:28:33.876 --> 01:28:37.512
This beautiful life
of mystery.

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:41.949
This beautiful life
can also feel like misery.

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:49.691
Sometimes it-- it just
doesn't make sense.

01:28:51.394 --> 01:28:54.867
Why are we on this never-ending
journey to find beauty,

01:28:54.897 --> 01:28:57.703
while beauty never
truly reveals itself?

01:28:57.733 --> 01:29:00.473
I once glimpsed beauty

01:29:00.503 --> 01:29:02.675
in a friend of mine.

01:29:02.705 --> 01:29:06.745
She was beauty,
but the world denied it.

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:09.682
And this beautiful soul
that I denied,

01:29:09.712 --> 01:29:11.884
in taking her own life,

01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:15.087
took a part of me.

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:19.558
My mother has been told
she's beautiful her whole life.

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:21.594
If you're beautiful
with no soul,

01:29:21.624 --> 01:29:22.628
are you even living?

01:29:22.658 --> 01:29:24.930
Am I just a walking soul

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.832
trying to emulate beauty
like everyone else,

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:28.634
only to have it destroyed

01:29:28.664 --> 01:29:30.603
by a man?

01:29:30.633 --> 01:29:33.138
A man once destroyed me.

01:29:33.168 --> 01:29:36.609
But when it's
all said and done

01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:39.845
no one can break my spirit.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:42.948
This is my journey,
and I will find my way.

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:45.551
Even if I fall short
of finding beauty,

01:29:45.581 --> 01:29:49.922
this beautiful life I long
for will reveal itself,

01:29:49.952 --> 01:29:51.790
because it's out there

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:55.957
waiting to be discovered.

01:30:06.168 --> 01:30:09.842
My name is Grace

01:30:09.872 --> 01:30:12.774
and this is my beautiful life.

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:21.583
Do you know
you're beautiful?

01:30:25.821 --> 01:30:28.523
* Today

01:30:29.525 --> 01:30:31.697
* I feel the same way

01:30:31.727 --> 01:30:35.062
* As an empty shell

01:30:35.798 --> 01:30:38.966
* Today

01:30:39.568 --> 01:30:40.773
* I feel

01:30:40.803 --> 01:30:43.742
* As lonely as hell

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.744
* In my head

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:49.582
* And I'm so tired

01:30:49.612 --> 01:30:51.884
* Of feeling

01:30:51.914 --> 01:30:54.019
* This way

01:30:54.049 --> 01:30:56.889
* And when I look at you

01:30:56.919 --> 01:31:00.759
* It makes me realize

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:05.727
* I don't even know who I am

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:08.667
* But maybe someday

01:31:08.697 --> 01:31:11.504
* Maybe someday I

01:31:11.534 --> 01:31:15.069
* Will find me

01:31:15.938 --> 01:31:18.744
* So maybe someday

01:31:18.774 --> 01:31:21.614
* Maybe someday I

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:25.212
* Will find you

01:31:27.883 --> 01:31:31.690
* But for now

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.557
* I'm still so lost

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:41.734
* And I don't know

01:31:41.764 --> 01:31:45.567
* What's missing to me

01:31:45.934 --> 01:31:48.774
* But maybe someday

01:31:48.804 --> 01:31:51.844
* Maybe someday I

01:31:51.874 --> 01:31:56.077
* Will find me

01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:58.784
* And maybe someday

01:31:58.814 --> 01:32:01.920
* Maybe someday I

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:05.820
* Will find you

01:32:06.589 --> 01:32:08.861
* And maybe someday

01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:11.830
* Maybe someday I

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.199
* Will find you

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:16.702
* I will find you

01:32:16.732 --> 01:32:19.037
* And maybe someday

01:32:19.067 --> 01:32:25.567
* I will find me,
I will find me *

01:32:26.942 --> 01:32:29.047
* I know

01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:31.884
* It will take some time

01:32:31.914 --> 01:32:33.586
* But I'm ready

01:32:33.616 --> 01:32:34.887
* To do

01:32:34.917 --> 01:32:36.855
* What it takes

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:39.625
* And I know

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:42.227
* It won't be easy

01:32:42.257 --> 01:32:44.930
* To find my way

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.899
* Out here

01:32:46.929 --> 01:32:49.602
* And I know

01:32:49.632 --> 01:32:51.970
* It will take some time

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.940
* But I'm ready to do

01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:57.009
* What it takes

01:32:57.039 --> 01:32:59.177
* And I know

01:32:59.207 --> 01:33:02.380
* It won't be easy

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:05.017
* To find my way

01:33:05.047 --> 01:33:06.919
* Out here

01:33:06.949 --> 01:33:09.387
* But maybe someday

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:12.390
* Maybe someday I

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:16.891
* Will find me

01:33:16.959 --> 01:33:19.865
* And maybe someday

01:33:19.895 --> 01:33:22.835
* Maybe someday I

01:33:22.865 --> 01:33:26.734
* Will find you

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:29.875
* And maybe someday

01:33:29.905 --> 01:33:32.878
* Maybe someday I

01:33:32.908 --> 01:33:34.880
* Will find you

01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:37.415
* I will find you

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:39.952
* And maybe someday

01:33:39.982 --> 01:33:46.287
* I will find me,
I will find me. *
