00:03.233 --> 00:04.766
Well, here we are, baby.

00:04.833 --> 00:08.766
Gate C‐8. The gateway
to paradise, Mrs. Jones.

00:08.833 --> 00:12.300
I want you to come to London
with me to live.

00:12.366 --> 00:14.766
Are you out of your
mind, man?

00:14.833 --> 00:17.300
Synlcaire moved out
and I gotta fill her spot.

00:17.366 --> 00:20.233
Ladies, I think
we got a family here.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.300
O‐Obie,
y‐you mean we're stranded

00:22.366 --> 00:24.366
on a deserted island?

00:24.433 --> 00:26.033
Well, technically, babe

00:26.100 --> 00:29.000
it won't be deserted
until we're dead.

00:30.966 --> 00:32.466
Wait!

00:32.533 --> 00:34.166
Wait, you forgot us!

00:34.233 --> 00:36.333
It's our honeymoon!

00:36.400 --> 00:37.366
Oh!

00:37.433 --> 00:39.366
Oh! Obie, quick!
Send up a flare.

00:41.766 --> 00:44.833
Oh, great, great. Now we're
at the funkadelic concert?

00:44.900 --> 00:46.600
That's the best I can do
unless you want me

00:46.666 --> 00:48.500
to set my pants on fire.

00:48.566 --> 00:49.800
Oh, that's how we got
into this mess

00:49.866 --> 00:51.700
the first place,
Mr. Frisky.

00:51.766 --> 00:54.300
Babe, relax, relax,
you know angry old Agnes

00:54.366 --> 00:56.700
will send out a rescue team
for us.

00:56.766 --> 00:58.466
And until said rescue

00:58.533 --> 01:00.366
I dare you to find
anything wrong

01:00.433 --> 01:04.040
with spending the night in this
tropical paradise all alone.

02:08.713 --> 02:12.446
Maxine Shaw, what foul act
are you doing in my kitchen?

02:15.213 --> 02:17.646
Getting busy
with a crab omelet.

02:17.713 --> 02:19.513
You know Regine, it could be me
or my hormones

02:19.579 --> 02:22.146
but you're lookin' mighty cute
in 'em jeans, baby.

02:28.146 --> 02:30.413
Excuse me, Ira,

02:30.480 --> 02:32.313
but I do not let strangers

02:32.380 --> 02:35.746
saute or souffle
with my gourmet cookware.

02:35.813 --> 02:37.713
Oh, I feel the same.

02:37.780 --> 02:38.980
That's why I brought my own.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.213
Breakfast?

02:43.280 --> 02:46.546
Nice try but I'm a strict
vegetarian.

02:46.613 --> 02:50.346
One vegetarian supreme
for the supreme vegetarian.

03:04.353 --> 03:05.420
Edible.

03:07.886 --> 03:08.886
Morning.

03:08.953 --> 03:11.220
Oh, Khadijah, good morning.

03:11.286 --> 03:13.320
Packed you a little
some‐some for later.

03:13.386 --> 03:14.986
Well, thank you.

03:15.053 --> 03:16.453
‐ Oh, a salad?
‐ Mm‐hm.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.086
‐ Little chicken thingies?
‐ Right.

03:18.153 --> 03:20.320
And a Yoo‐hoo.
How'd you know?

03:20.386 --> 03:21.920
It was in a fridge marked
Khadijah's.

03:21.986 --> 03:24.120
Touch at your own risk.

03:24.186 --> 03:25.786
Now if you ladies will excuse me

03:25.853 --> 03:28.120
I gotta go and put
my name on the mailbox.

03:28.186 --> 03:31.053
Well, you just make sure
that's in pencil, bruh.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.753
Oh, Lord,
I love that guy.

03:38.820 --> 03:39.953
Who is he?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.786
That's our new roommate.

03:41.853 --> 03:43.786
Oh, I thought
you hired a new chef.

03:45.886 --> 03:48.720
So, mate, all packed
for the big move to London?

03:48.786 --> 03:50.320
Alright. Look..

03:50.386 --> 03:52.786
I came here to eat
not open my soul.

03:52.853 --> 03:54.986
You know,
that gives me indigestion.

03:55.053 --> 03:57.686
You know, that front is gonna
cost you the man you love.

03:57.753 --> 03:59.653
‐ Who says I love him?
‐ You did.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.826
‐ Who says I'm in it?
‐ You did!

04:00.893 --> 04:01.960
Alright, check this out, girl.

04:02.026 --> 04:03.993
You need to stop listening
to what I say.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.693
Besides, it's the nineties.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.760
We don't follow men
all over the world anymore.

04:08.826 --> 04:11.193
It's about time
they start following us.

04:11.260 --> 04:14.160
So Kyle should give up his
carrier so you don't have to.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.593
That's what I'm saying.

04:17.660 --> 04:21.660
Look, Max, buddy, it's not like
I won't miss you 'cause I will

04:21.726 --> 04:24.026
but somebody has to make
that move.

04:24.093 --> 04:27.326
But I'm Maxine Shaw,
attorney at law.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.126
Now if not that, who am I?

04:29.193 --> 04:31.226
What do I have?

04:31.293 --> 04:34.626
Somebody to rub lotion on those
crusty feet of yours at night.

04:40.893 --> 04:42.360
Oh, okay, w‐w‐what was it?

04:42.426 --> 04:45.526
A‐a mountain lion, a wolf,
a velociraptor?

04:45.593 --> 04:48.660
Some sorta tropical guinea pig.

04:48.726 --> 04:50.426
A whole family of 'em
snortin' together

04:50.493 --> 04:53.026
can make almighty roar.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.860
Don't you lie to make me
feel better.

04:54.926 --> 04:57.160
If there's a, an angry
ferocious animal out there

04:57.226 --> 04:58.460
you tell me!

04:58.526 --> 05:02.566
Well, I don't know if he was
angry so much as hungry.

05:02.633 --> 05:06.133
Great. We're gonna be eaten
alive and it's all your fault!

05:06.200 --> 05:09.766
‐ Now calm down, sugarlumps.
‐ Calm down?

05:09.833 --> 05:11.533
It's easy for you
to say calm down.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.833
You're nothing but bones.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.533
I'm the one with
the sweet meat.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.366
Well, you didn't complain about
these bones last night?

05:17.433 --> 05:20.366
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

05:20.433 --> 05:21.766
Alright, now you're
getting personal.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.533
And might I add,
a bit petty.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
Oh, you haven't seen petty.

05:25.666 --> 05:28.400
Oh, I'm looking at a heapin'
helpin' of it right now.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.633
Dagnabbit.

05:40.666 --> 05:41.733
Obie..

05:41.800 --> 05:43.533
What, woman?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.400
Are you scared?

05:45.466 --> 05:47.333
Nah, that beast was rippin'
apart a goat.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.300
He's probably full by now.

05:51.066 --> 05:52.833
No.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.500
I'm talking about us.
About marriage.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.500
Oh, that beast.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.140
I mean, it's just
all so new.

06:01.206 --> 06:03.873
I don't know what you expect
of me. I've never been a wife.

06:03.940 --> 06:07.540
Well, I never had a wife, so
it's not like I could tell you

06:07.606 --> 06:09.540
if you were doin' a bad job.

06:10.873 --> 06:13.240
That was just the reassurance
I was looking for.

06:15.073 --> 06:16.073
Look, babe, you're..

06:16.140 --> 06:19.740
Just...try not to let
the fears and doubts

06:19.806 --> 06:21.206
of marriage overwhelm you.

06:21.273 --> 06:23.106
I mean, I know,
I'm tryin'.

06:25.873 --> 06:27.906
Well, can we do this?

06:27.973 --> 06:32.073
Well, we say we could in front
of God and all our friends.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.106
I'm sure our friends will
forgive us if we don't

06:34.173 --> 06:36.306
but I don't know
about God.

06:37.806 --> 06:42.073
Well, maybe we can
make it work, right here.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.940
I'm reminded
of another young couple

06:44.006 --> 06:47.106
that were stranded together
and let love lead the way.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.406
Hm.

06:48.473 --> 06:49.906
'The only couple
that comes to mind'

06:49.973 --> 06:52.073
is Thurston and Lovey Howell

06:52.140 --> 06:55.140
but there's was a mature
island love.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.706
No, I'm talking
about Brooke shields

06:57.773 --> 07:00.813
and Christopher Atkins in

07:15.680 --> 07:18.180
Um, "Endless Love"
was a far less successful

07:18.246 --> 07:20.080
Brooke shield's effort.

"Pluck one, two will come."

07:51.413 --> 07:52.546
What?

07:54.246 --> 07:56.346
Nobody ever told me
about that stupid saying.

07:56.413 --> 07:58.480
Why didn't you tell me
about that stupid saying?

07:58.546 --> 08:00.046
Alright now,
just relax, honey.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.453
Eh, morning, ladies.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.920
Uh, Khadijah..

08:08.986 --> 08:10.453
You think you can give me
a lift to the airport tonight?

08:10.520 --> 08:11.686
Mm‐hm.

08:11.753 --> 08:14.820
You know, I would've gone
to London with you.

08:14.886 --> 08:16.753
[chuckling]

08:17.486 --> 08:19.286
Yeah, Regine, look..

08:19.353 --> 08:21.153
Uh, thank you, thank you
but that would've been like

08:21.220 --> 08:22.286
taking my little sister.

08:22.353 --> 08:24.286
Yeah b‐but it makes
so much more sense.

08:24.353 --> 08:27.353
I mean, you and I
are the only two around here

08:27.420 --> 08:28.853
that have any style.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.520
Uh, that's true.

08:30.586 --> 08:34.820
And besides we would be
so close to Paree and Milan

08:34.885 --> 08:36.885
with all of the fabulous people.

08:36.953 --> 08:39.953
‐ Ooh.
‐ Oh, why am I stuck here?

08:47.720 --> 08:49.953
To help those who need it.

08:51.386 --> 08:53.253
[both laughing]

08:53.920 --> 08:56.020
I'm gonna miss you.

08:56.086 --> 08:58.653
Aw.
I'm gonna miss you too, Boo.

09:07.826 --> 09:11.493
You know, Kyle, I can't believe
you're really going.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.293
I mean, I knew Max
would be stubborn

09:13.360 --> 09:15.260
but I really expected
more from you.

09:15.326 --> 09:17.926
See that's the problem,
Khadijah, so to Maxine.

09:17.993 --> 09:19.160
And why should I
give her more

09:19.226 --> 09:20.826
than she's willing
to give to me?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.826
Amen, brother.
Leave the witch.

09:24.726 --> 09:26.926
So you make the same mistake
that I did.

09:26.993 --> 09:28.493
I mean, I've poured
the last five years

09:28.560 --> 09:30.026
of my life into Flavor.

09:30.093 --> 09:32.760
Khadijah, look, it's more
than just my career. Come on.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.926
Look at my history with Maxine.

09:34.993 --> 09:36.693
Do you honestly blame me
for not wanting

09:36.760 --> 09:38.826
to risk my future
on a relationship like that?

09:38.893 --> 09:41.960
No. Kyle, look,
now you look out for number one.

09:42.026 --> 09:43.526
Me, me, me, me, me!

09:43.593 --> 09:45.093
That's the key to success.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.260
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hm.

09:46.326 --> 09:47.960
Well, I'm glad you feel
that way, Regine.

09:48.026 --> 09:49.593
In light of the fact
that when I'm gone

09:49.660 --> 09:52.093
you will be
Maxine's only target.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.460
No. Oh, no!

09:54.526 --> 09:56.093
‐ Oh!
‐ That's right.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.593
‐ I'm beggin' you.
‐ 'No.'

09:57.660 --> 09:59.293
M‐M‐Max is your one true love.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.233
‐ No, please!
‐ That's true girl.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.600
You've been talking about me.

10:11.766 --> 10:13.533
I can feel it.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.100
Alright, what gives?

10:16.966 --> 10:20.133
So are you staying or going?

10:20.200 --> 10:22.466
‐ Where will you be?
‐ London.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.566
‐ You?
‐ West of there, here.

10:24.633 --> 10:26.033
‐ Too bad.
‐ Sure enough.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.166
Thought you were smarter
than that.

10:27.233 --> 10:30.933
‐ Ooh, guess not. Bye‐bye.
‐ Your loss.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.533
I just got reservations at
Donald Trump's new restaurant.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.533
I guess I have to go
with somebody else.

10:37.933 --> 10:39.566
Don't forget your girl.

10:45.533 --> 10:49.066
Hey! Break out your Swiss Obie
knife. I got breakfast.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.200
Look at all with your
"Cast Away" self.

10:51.266 --> 10:52.733
How you land this big boar?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.100
Oh, I had to move fast.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.166
The tide almost washed him

10:55.233 --> 10:56.533
off the beach but I gotcha.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.500
Uh‐huh! Huh?

10:59.700 --> 11:00.806
Well, might be better

11:00.873 --> 11:03.706
if we don't eat
this particular fish, baby.

11:04.106 --> 11:05.173
Oh.

11:07.140 --> 11:09.406
‐ He sank real fast, didn't he?
‐ Yeah.

11:09.473 --> 11:11.573
You know something..

11:11.640 --> 11:13.340
If I have to be stranded
for the rest of my life

11:13.406 --> 11:15.373
without a glimmer of hope,
I'm glad it's with you.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.640
Hm, thank you,
my marooned mama.

11:17.706 --> 11:18.640
‐ You know what?
‐ What?

11:18.706 --> 11:20.406
I don't care if we do
get rescued.

11:20.473 --> 11:22.440
Me neither.

11:22.506 --> 11:23.773
Oh, a rescue chopper.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.773
We gettin' up
out of this hellhole.

11:31.806 --> 11:32.840
Hey!
Look at me!

11:32.906 --> 11:36.040
[both screaming]

11:36.106 --> 11:38.506
(Obie)
Thank you. Thank you.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.073
I told you we can go home.

11:44.606 --> 11:47.140
[all cheering]

11:47.206 --> 11:48.773
Oh, no.

11:49.973 --> 11:51.840
May I have your attention,
please?

12:03.513 --> 12:06.713
Uh, this is an
unauthorized gathering.

12:06.780 --> 12:09.613
Well, I didn't know
I had to pull a permit to party.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.613
You have to clear..

12:14.713 --> 12:18.513
You have to clear all gatherings
in the common area with <i>moi.</i>

12:18.580 --> 12:20.580
All sanctioned events
are subject

12:20.646 --> 12:22.946
to guest list approval
by <i>moi.</i>

12:23.013 --> 12:26.146
But this moi pays one‐third
of the rent.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.380
Oh, just hack up
the French language.

12:29.446 --> 12:32.246
You just wait till Khadijah
hears about this.

12:32.313 --> 12:34.313
Get your hot nachos here, baby.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.013
Get 'em while they're hot.

12:38.646 --> 12:40.680
Why do I feel like
I just walked into Hooters?

12:43.480 --> 12:45.913
Why don't you go suck the fun
out of somebody else's party?

12:48.380 --> 12:49.880
Now look.

12:49.946 --> 12:54.513
These undesirables and their
little ring leader must go.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.613
Look, you can't just
kick Trip out.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.386
I'm shocked. Why?
'Cause the queen said so?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.486
And now look, all of you
everybody..

13:17.920 --> 13:20.553
Look who finally came
to my party.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.353
Hi, sweety.
I'm Regine.

13:25.420 --> 13:27.753
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.720
And I'm your hostess.

13:29.786 --> 13:32.820
Weren't you a leading lady
in one of my videos?

13:34.186 --> 13:36.120
If you want me to be.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.320
Yo, Trip, I know you saved me
some nachos.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.586
‐ Right?
‐ Uh‐huh. Y‐you gotta move.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.520
Get that, Montel.

13:46.586 --> 13:49.553
I was just gonna go
and whip up some dip.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.686
Hey! Who turned down
the game, huh?

13:53.753 --> 13:56.486
Sure, now somebody
was winning.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.093
I have to admit,
if we never made it back

14:00.160 --> 14:03.460
I would've sure missed
strawberry pina coladas.

14:03.526 --> 14:07.093
Not me, girl. I'd have still
been intoxicated by your beauty.

14:10.426 --> 14:12.360
Hey, um, are you‐you starting
to get a little tired

14:12.426 --> 14:15.126
of all this cutsie stuff?

14:15.193 --> 14:16.226
Yeah, maybe a little bit now

14:16.293 --> 14:18.026
that we're an old
married couple.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.993
Oh, yeah, girl,
check this out.

14:21.060 --> 14:25.293
Talked to Kyle and he's going
to London without Max.

14:27.193 --> 14:29.426
Oh, that's just so sad.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.893
I always thought the two of them
would destined to be together.

14:32.593 --> 14:33.993
Oh, don't worry.

14:34.060 --> 14:36.860
That fire won't go out until
there's nothing left in him

14:36.926 --> 14:38.293
but teeth and toe nails.

14:38.360 --> 14:42.360
Oh. that must be a long time
from now. Let me give you.

14:42.426 --> 14:44.260
Yo..

14:44.326 --> 14:46.260
Oh, Lord, sea hag alert.

14:47.593 --> 14:51.026
Listen up you stragglers,
I have your bill

14:51.093 --> 14:53.126
for the helicopter rescue.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.426
‐ No checks or money orders.
‐ Um‐mm.

14:56.493 --> 14:58.426
You know what you can do
with that bill, lady?

14:59.793 --> 15:01.600
Oh, honey, honey,
let me handle it.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.600
Yes, honey, honey,
let her handle it.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.166
Handle it.

15:06.233 --> 15:08.600
What my husband
is trying to say here

15:08.666 --> 15:12.233
is that we've had enough
of your stank attitude.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.266
'Let me tell you something.'

15:13.333 --> 15:15.633
If you so much as
breathe on our honeymoon

15:15.700 --> 15:19.000
we will tie you to an anchor and
drag your butt off some car.

15:19.066 --> 15:20.200
You hear me?

15:23.833 --> 15:25.966
I mean, you really
don't have to get ugly.

15:27.966 --> 15:30.633
But it is an
interesting method.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.733
You know you could have
a future on this cruise line.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.866
Oh, really?

15:34.666 --> 15:37.000
Yo..

15:37.066 --> 15:38.900
I don't care if he is
your seeing eye dog.

15:38.966 --> 15:40.900
He does not get a life jacket.

15:42.666 --> 15:46.133
Well, where were we,
Mr. Jones?

15:46.200 --> 15:49.300
About to start our new life
together, Mrs. Jones.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.666
You know, that was kinda cutsie

15:52.733 --> 15:55.533
and I liked it.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.366
‐ Let's go to the room.
‐ Come on.

16:02.506 --> 16:04.973
(male announcer)
'Final boarding call
for Flight 462 to London.'

16:06.773 --> 16:08.706
Say goodbye, Khadijah.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.073
I don't want to.

16:20.206 --> 16:22.640
‐ Bye, big brother.
‐ Bye, Boo.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.973
‐ I love you.
‐ I love you too.

16:28.006 --> 16:29.573
Stop that plane!

16:29.640 --> 16:30.773
Please, Barker.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.906
Well, look who finally came
to her senses.

16:33.973 --> 16:35.906
Yeah, n‐no freak that, um..

16:38.173 --> 16:40.306
I just want to give you
one more chance..

16:42.540 --> 16:44.973
...to get over yourself
and stay.

16:46.540 --> 16:50.073
Why don't you get over yourself
and get your butt on this plane?

16:50.140 --> 16:52.840
Oh, you smooth talking bastard.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.840
You are making
a big mistake, Maxine.

16:57.906 --> 16:58.973
That way you're making
a bigger one.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.213
Look, I‐I'm, uh..

17:01.280 --> 17:04.680
I'm not going to get into this
competition thing with you.

17:04.746 --> 17:06.012
Not this time.

17:08.046 --> 17:10.012
Damn, I'm gonna miss you.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.012
I'll miss you more.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.846
Oh, come on!

17:15.913 --> 17:18.445
Kyle..

17:18.512 --> 17:19.980
Can't you give a girl
a kiss?

18:03.453 --> 18:04.653
[sighs]

18:04.720 --> 18:05.720
You okay?

18:05.786 --> 18:08.786
Oh, yep, I will be.

18:11.353 --> 18:12.620
Well, I'm not.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.620
What are you doing
with my toothbrush?

18:25.686 --> 18:28.253
There was a spider,
I had to flick it.

18:33.453 --> 18:36.486
Hey, hold up. Does this mean
you going to London?

18:36.553 --> 18:39.086
Or just robbing us
blind as usual.

18:39.153 --> 18:40.586
Taking a ride out to Vegas.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.386
I cashed in Kyle's ticket

18:42.453 --> 18:45.686
and now I'm gonna go party
with a pair of one eyed jacks.

18:47.086 --> 18:48.286
You know what, you need
to face it, Max.

18:48.353 --> 18:49.986
You blew it.

18:50.053 --> 18:52.786
I blew it?
No, Kyle blew it.

18:52.853 --> 18:54.420
Let me tell you something,
he had a chance

18:54.486 --> 18:57.153
to wake up every morning
to this face saying I love you

18:57.220 --> 18:59.053
and he hopped on a plane.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.393
Where's the logic in that?
Where's the justice?

19:02.926 --> 19:04.193
No justice, no peace.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.026
You know how much you need,
Max.. You need closure.

19:10.093 --> 19:12.093
I know I sure do.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.693
Now I am sick to death of men

19:13.760 --> 19:16.293
who love themselves
more than they love me.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.293
Mm‐hm.
Those selfish bastards.

19:19.826 --> 19:24.060
Let me tell you about that nacho
eatin' Montel Jordan did.

19:24.126 --> 19:25.660
He slips me a note.

19:25.726 --> 19:27.093
I think it's his phone number.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.826
Oh, but no.

19:28.893 --> 19:32.193
It's his stank autograph.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.260
Why is everybody trying
to give me their autograph?

19:34.326 --> 19:37.760
I mean, well, do I, do I
look like some groupie?

19:37.826 --> 19:40.593
‐ Well, I, uh‐‐
‐ Max, don't. No, please.

19:40.660 --> 19:42.926
Let her have her little
Angela Bassett moment.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.493
You know, I‐I'm just gonna
flush that autograph

19:46.560 --> 19:47.993
right to the Hudson.

19:50.926 --> 19:53.193
So, Vegas, huh?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.560
That's right.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.260
And don't try to
stop me, mother.

19:56.326 --> 19:58.860
Hey, I'm through tryin to tell
you what to do.

19:58.926 --> 20:01.133
I just want you to put
20 down on 6 the hard way.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.233
Can you do that for me?

20:04.900 --> 20:07.200
Goodbye, to fickle men.

20:07.266 --> 20:10.433
From now on, it's about me.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.433
Ooh, that's new.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.466
Shut up.

20:15.533 --> 20:16.933
And come on,
it's your turn.

20:18.533 --> 20:19.666
Okay.

20:19.733 --> 20:21.333
Now you know this is just
stupid, right?

20:21.400 --> 20:22.600
‐ Do it.
‐ Alright, okay. Alright.

20:22.666 --> 20:24.866
If it'll shut you up, fine.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.666
From now on, I'm not gonna
let my job run my life.

20:29.733 --> 20:33.300
Uh, p‐pardon me.
But that's my toothbrush.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.866
No, it's a symbol
of oppression.

20:38.833 --> 20:41.466
Here's a key
to Kyle's apartment.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.433
And now that door..

20:51.500 --> 20:54.166
That door led to nowhere.

20:54.233 --> 20:55.633
You know what, from now on

20:55.700 --> 20:57.366
Maxine Shaw
is her own woman.

20:57.433 --> 20:58.900
‐ Alright.
‐ Oh, yeah.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.440
You know, I think it'd be
a little bit more dramatic

21:00.506 --> 21:03.140
if we just torch
the whole toilet.

21:03.206 --> 21:04.140
What's up?

21:04.206 --> 21:05.240
This is what you women do

21:05.306 --> 21:06.940
when you go
to the bathroom together.

21:14.406 --> 21:18.373
Uh, I guess what we discuss
in bathroom rules next.

21:19.406 --> 21:20.740
Stop lookin', girl.

21:20.806 --> 21:23.706
With hind parts like that,
who‐who needs rules?

21:25.140 --> 21:28.573
Well, now, you need
at least one rule.

21:28.640 --> 21:32.640
Never flush the toilet when
somebody's taking a shower.

21:34.340 --> 21:36.273
[screams]

21:38.473 --> 21:40.406
Flush it again, see if he runs
out of there.

21:48.273 --> 21:49.306
Oh!

21:51.773 --> 21:53.506
Never flush the toilet

21:53.573 --> 21:56.706
when somebody's taking
a shower.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.546
Don't you do that, girl
don't you dare! We're busy.

22:02.013 --> 22:03.780
Don't you do it!

22:03.846 --> 22:05.846
Obie and I had a fight.
Carry on.

22:11.246 --> 22:12.213
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>'Woo‐hoo.'</i>
