WEBVTT

00:10.761 --> 00:11.513
No, Bubs.

00:11.602 --> 00:14.403
I mean, there's gotta be rules
or else things get fucked up.

00:15.627 --> 00:17.057
Ain't no rules
for dope fiends.

00:18.742 --> 00:21.375
When the police got you shackled up,
you make a move, right ?

00:21.387 --> 00:22.295
You help yourself out.

00:22.310 --> 00:24.310
But you just start
snitchin' for no reason...

00:24.330 --> 00:25.249
it doesn't make no...

00:26.210 --> 00:27.262
Let me track this.

00:27.835 --> 00:30.368
You hypopulatin' that you can
tattle-tale when you locked up

00:30.375 --> 00:32.502
but you can't do it
straight up for the money ?

00:32.807 --> 00:34.833
I mean, no offense, son, but...

00:35.010 --> 00:37.929
that some weak-ass thinkin'.
You equivocatin' like a motherfuck.

00:40.028 --> 00:42.562
- Okay, so a snitch is a snitch, right ?
- There you go.

00:42.574 --> 00:43.888
So why be one, man ?

00:44.240 --> 00:45.929
I mean, we gettin'
by with our capers.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.134
We gettin' by out here
every damn day

00:48.170 --> 00:50.552
rippin' and runnin' and ain't
got shit to show for it.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.212
It's part of being a soldier ?

00:53.248 --> 00:55.321
I mean, that's true, right,
that's what you says.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.539
That was 'fore I put all
this mileage on these feet.

00:57.562 --> 00:59.638
You wait, you wait,
till you ain't a pup no more,

00:59.662 --> 01:01.939
see if you ain't lookin'
for somethin' a little more,

01:01.974 --> 01:03.709
a little more steady
for your ownself.

01:08.164 --> 01:10.018
What the fuck ?
You gettin' ill already.

01:10.652 --> 01:12.001
It's not even past morning.

01:12.752 --> 01:14.771
I'm cool, man.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.496
Look, we hook up with
my girl Kima, we get paid

01:18.637 --> 01:19.564
you gonna be better.

01:20.102 --> 01:22.791
Fuck that, Bubs, alright ?
I'm not a fuckin' snitch.

01:22.873 --> 01:23.738
You know...

01:24.300 --> 01:25.638
I could argue the other side.

01:25.954 --> 01:28.840
Say that if you drop dime
to duck a charge, then you a snitch.

01:28.864 --> 01:31.292
You do it as a living,
you a professional.

01:35.418 --> 01:36.884
Hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

01:36.923 --> 01:39.776
You see that, that ladder right there.
Just like old times, man.

01:40.379 --> 01:42.443
I'll be the bad guy,
you be the lone ranger.

01:42.467 --> 01:43.371
Leave that man be.

01:43.793 --> 01:45.705
We get paid more
hooking up to my girl.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.767
But that's cash money
right there.

01:55.043 --> 01:56.964
With the white man,
I best be the bad guy.

01:56.988 --> 01:58.191
That way he ain't confused.

01:59.159 --> 02:00.535
Alright, meet me in the alley.

02:02.149 --> 02:02.596
Fuck.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.175
Yo, Mister.

02:10.773 --> 02:11.242
Yo.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.234
Throw down your wallet, or I'm
a jerk this ladder right out.

02:14.239 --> 02:14.577
What ?

02:14.581 --> 02:15.011
No, no !

02:15.093 --> 02:16.546
I'm a poor man
who ain't playin'.

02:16.565 --> 02:17.916
Throw down
the got-damn money.

02:17.936 --> 02:18.452
Please, no.

02:21.757 --> 02:22.707
Leave that man alone.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.554 --> 02:34.246
Thank you.

02:35.510 --> 02:36.919
He's crazy, man.

02:37.201 --> 02:38.268
What's that guy doing ?

02:38.948 --> 02:39.547
Oh, shit.

02:40.262 --> 02:41.799
- Here, here.
- I can't, I can't.

02:41.810 --> 02:43.324
No, you saved my ass.

02:44.685 --> 02:45.846
It's appreciated you know.

02:55.064 --> 02:57.058
Yo, Bubs.
You won't fuckin' believe this.

03:00.291 --> 03:00.700
Bubs ?

04:35.916 --> 04:37.768
Straight and True

04:50.790 --> 04:52.573
<i>Dennis, you up ?</i>

04:52.947 --> 04:53.743
<i>Dennis ?</i>

04:55.655 --> 04:57.378
Mee-maw, hey.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.100
Guess you're not
workin' today, huh ?

05:00.839 --> 05:02.188
I'm workin' nights now.

05:03.478 --> 05:04.091
At a bar.

05:05.124 --> 05:05.992
Workin' the door.

05:07.095 --> 05:08.738
You know, it's just...

05:09.782 --> 05:12.291
just 'til I find
somethin' a little bit better.

05:13.358 --> 05:14.250
Reminds me.

05:15.283 --> 05:17.124
Your friend called
again this morning.

05:17.429 --> 05:19.858
She said for you
to remember your appointment.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.995
Says there's a job in it,
if you still lookin'.

05:47.069 --> 05:48.161
So, Marlo, right ?

05:48.618 --> 05:50.436
He got this one boy
watchin' his back

05:50.824 --> 05:51.950
name be Chris Partlow.

05:52.278 --> 05:53.240
Barlow with a "b" ?

05:53.533 --> 05:55.692
Part, like white people
got in their hair.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.627
And low, like
a low-bottom dope fiend.

05:58.144 --> 05:59.800
- Partlow.
- Yeah, what I said.

06:00.432 --> 06:01.734
So, he's Marlo's muscle ?

06:02.626 --> 06:03.317
So...

06:10.170 --> 06:11.277
how much is that worth ?

06:11.484 --> 06:13.536
Five, if I can
work up a photo id.

06:17.383 --> 06:19.506
The boy, Fruit, he used that.

06:19.975 --> 06:21.977
Fruit who runs
one of Marlo's corners ?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.126
Careful, it's got prints.

06:23.302 --> 06:24.029
Prints, huh ?

06:24.182 --> 06:26.634
Look at you, gettin' all
C.S.I. on me and shit.

06:26.704 --> 06:29.462
A burner with prints.
That's gotta mean cash money, right ?

06:30.576 --> 06:33.898
If I can pull a print,  get Fruit id'd,
I can go to ten.

06:37.348 --> 06:39.658
An' if I show you where
Marlo hides his Mercedes.

06:40.021 --> 06:41.417
The Benz would go for 15.

06:42.598 --> 06:45.238
You don't know it, but these
are hard times in a hard land.

06:45.273 --> 06:46.657
You killin' me out here, girl.

06:47.139 --> 06:47.771
A-ight.

06:48.217 --> 06:49.404
25 for the Benz.

06:51.432 --> 06:52.624
You good peoples.

06:53.293 --> 06:54.231
So let's total up

06:55.122 --> 06:57.059
we at 40, right ?

07:02.219 --> 07:02.525
Here.

07:02.852 --> 07:03.673
Bank that for me.

07:03.921 --> 07:04.483
Bank it ?

07:05.069 --> 07:05.574
For what ?

07:06.020 --> 07:07.145
Got me a plan, girl.

07:07.919 --> 07:08.929
The hoppers out here

07:09.527 --> 07:13.126
they only be wearin' them big white shirts
a couple of times 'fore they chuck 'em.

07:13.137 --> 07:15.437
So I'm thinkin' while I'm out
here workin' for y'all

07:15.507 --> 07:17.864
I'ma get my ends up, sell 'em
shirts on the corners.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.659
I'll make my nut
comin' an' goin'.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.391
Truthfully, I don't know
what more you could have done.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.564
Charlie's right, boss.

07:43.268 --> 07:44.077
You tried.

07:44.710 --> 07:46.478
Fuckin' hoodleheads
won't cooperate.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.929
Here you are, giving 'em
their own block or two

07:48.953 --> 07:50.889
offering them a place
to sell drugs in peace

07:50.913 --> 07:52.368
and do they even
fuckin' listen ?

07:52.379 --> 07:54.452
It's a damn shame, too,
'cause if it worked

07:54.476 --> 07:56.797
you mighta had a positive
effect on the community.

07:56.879 --> 07:58.943
<i>Shift commander
call the front desk.</i>

08:00.140 --> 08:02.486
You guys are some
lying sacks of shit.

08:04.325 --> 08:05.053
I'm sayin', sir...

08:05.088 --> 08:07.725
I'm guessin' that you

08:08.588 --> 08:11.041
have some thoughts on where
we should go from here.

08:12.155 --> 08:15.407
Well, sir, we were thinkin'
a modified zebra operation.

08:15.664 --> 08:19.441
Jumpouts rotating from sector-to-sector,
combined with a zero tolerance approach.

08:19.523 --> 08:21.543
We detail a couple
of men from each shift

08:21.755 --> 08:22.668
build a flex unit

08:22.846 --> 08:25.120
double up on the head-knocking
and corner-clearing.

08:25.121 --> 08:26.482
More of the same, you mean.

08:26.623 --> 08:27.396
But better.

08:27.948 --> 08:28.569
Better ?

08:30.361 --> 08:31.359
Better than nothing.

08:54.990 --> 08:57.137
Ah, fuck this bullshit already !

08:58.720 --> 09:01.065
Man, they gave us 15 cases of legal

09:01.704 --> 09:03.722
but they shorted us
on the colored bonds...

09:04.367 --> 09:05.435
what's going on there ?

09:10.537 --> 09:11.312
I got this.

09:15.618 --> 09:16.450
Officer.

09:17.104 --> 09:18.018
Detective, String.

09:18.781 --> 09:19.379
You remember ?

09:19.683 --> 09:21.819
Bird trial, detective McNulty.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.918
You want something copied, man ?

09:24.305 --> 09:25.104
Search warrant ?

09:25.537 --> 09:26.347
Court papers ?

09:26.557 --> 09:28.151
Anything I do to help, you know ?

09:28.584 --> 09:30.051
I ain't seen you around the way.

09:30.649 --> 09:33.653
I'm not around the way no more.
You wanna find me, I'm right here.

09:34.744 --> 09:35.658
Right here, huh ?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.830
This an' some real estate
I'm workin' on is all.

09:39.925 --> 09:40.440
You know ?

09:40.476 --> 09:42.399
More than enough
to occupy me, really.

09:48.556 --> 09:49.938
Say where you livin', man ?

09:50.759 --> 09:51.663
Where am I living ?

09:51.899 --> 09:53.928
Well, if you thinkin'
a comin' downtown

09:53.963 --> 09:57.013
I got some condos about to come
on the line in eight months.

09:57.635 --> 10:00.353
You say the word, I'ma hook you
up something nice down there

10:00.376 --> 10:01.186
by the hippodrome.

10:01.877 --> 10:02.863
Loft apartments.

10:03.356 --> 10:04.118
Real nice.

10:08.835 --> 10:10.149
You disappoint me, String.

10:10.172 --> 10:11.721
I had such fuckin' hopes for us.

10:13.129 --> 10:14.537
Have a nice day, officer.

10:24.339 --> 10:25.305
You see this shit ?

10:26.936 --> 10:29.082
Remember that kid
who got shot in the parking lot

10:29.094 --> 10:30.748
at Lake Clifton
a couple months back ?

10:30.760 --> 10:31.581
Drug feud, right ?

10:32.437 --> 10:33.119
What about it ?

10:33.506 --> 10:35.957
Well, last night, they just
found the only eyewitness.

10:35.992 --> 10:38.510
In an alleyway,
buncha holes in him.

10:38.545 --> 10:39.109
And ?

10:39.800 --> 10:41.079
What do you mean, "and" ?

10:41.678 --> 10:43.530
You're talking about
a state's witness.

10:44.504 --> 10:47.375
You let a witness get killed in
a high-profile case like this

10:47.411 --> 10:49.509
it says the city's
broke and can't be fixed.

10:51.047 --> 10:52.393
Sounds like we found an issue.

10:52.414 --> 10:53.914
Fuck the politics for a minute.

10:54.484 --> 10:57.557
You know, this is something
we all need to be on the same page with.

10:58.813 --> 10:59.809
I'm serious, Tony.

11:00.948 --> 11:03.703
You let shit like this stand,
pretty soon you got nothing left.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.980
You gonna go public
and bang the Mayor with it ?

11:07.141 --> 11:09.547
You gonna bang Burrell
and the state's attorney then ?

11:10.180 --> 11:11.481
I ain't gonna bang nobody.

11:11.775 --> 11:14.016
Like I said, fuck the politics for once.

11:14.931 --> 11:17.860
But there is a problem here
and I'm gonna do something to fix it.

11:17.883 --> 11:20.604
You want your cape
and the little red underpants ?

11:21.578 --> 11:23.631
Or you stash that shit
in the phone booth ?

11:25.931 --> 11:27.408
I always wondered about that.

11:33.015 --> 11:35.843
Man, I like a piece of that.

11:36.715 --> 11:38.193
You'd like any piece at all.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.598
I think I'd like
a piece of your mother.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.170
Yo, stop fuckin' around !

11:42.264 --> 11:43.565
He started that shit.

11:44.211 --> 11:47.727
Yo, she got our boy
with his nose wide open.

11:48.488 --> 11:52.242
He's stealing from us,
and she most likely the reason for it.

11:53.051 --> 11:56.244
And y'all stay with the girl,
she'll soon enough show us the money.

11:57.136 --> 11:58.145
Hey, where you goin' ?

12:00.579 --> 12:02.586
Yo, I got something I got to do.

12:02.668 --> 12:04.627
You supposed to be here
on this shit with us.

12:04.637 --> 12:07.758
Y'all stay with the girl,
I'll get back with y'all down the way.

12:08.304 --> 12:08.844
Say what ?

12:09.290 --> 12:12.633
Yo, I made a date a while back.
Gotta keep it.

12:14.205 --> 12:16.493
Man made a date, gotta keep it.

12:18.511 --> 12:21.276
You find out he pussy-whipped
like this motherfuck over here.

12:23.106 --> 12:25.240
Now, once again, from the data :

12:26.085 --> 12:27.681
When are most cars stolen ?

12:28.126 --> 12:29.076
Sir, at night.

12:29.358 --> 12:34.554
And your unit, which I believe is
charged with deterring the theft of autos

12:35.504 --> 12:36.467
when do you work ?

12:36.643 --> 12:39.599
The day shift, eight-to-four.
But sir, as I tried to explain...

12:44.815 --> 12:45.988
Your position is clear :

12:46.000 --> 12:49.483
You affect more arrests of car thieves
during the daylight than at night.

12:49.530 --> 12:51.219
You see, our ears work.

12:52.478 --> 12:53.076
We heard you.

12:53.628 --> 12:54.894
But the question becomes :

12:55.117 --> 12:56.854
Why the fuck can't you hear us ?

12:57.030 --> 12:59.223
- Sir, I don't...
- The Commissioner is attempting

12:59.224 --> 13:02.445
to move this department
from the dark ages into the 21st century.

13:02.904 --> 13:06.597
That means preventing crime
by relying on computer generated data

13:06.808 --> 13:09.670
not on your
fly-by-your-fucked-up-ass instinct.

13:11.694 --> 13:13.313
Give me the auto theft numbers

13:13.348 --> 13:15.860
for downtown parking lots
on friday nights.

13:17.655 --> 13:18.873
Sir, I have to check that.

13:23.372 --> 13:24.698
Where are we with the gun ?

13:25.766 --> 13:27.792
Colonel, I was made to understand

13:27.804 --> 13:31.286
that recovering officer Dozerman's
lost weapon was a priority.

13:31.299 --> 13:34.361
Oh, the gun, yes, we're on it, sir.
Making progress as we speak.

13:36.853 --> 13:37.649
Lieutenant ?

13:38.131 --> 13:40.968
Sir, I now understand that
prevention is the way to go

13:41.192 --> 13:43.949
and will immediately change
our hours to reflect the data.

13:44.945 --> 13:45.766
Alright, Lieutenant.

13:49.054 --> 13:50.075
Fecal gravity.

13:51.270 --> 13:54.449
Hey, you beat on the right people
and the shit rolls down the hill.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.124
Dennis is it ?

14:13.347 --> 14:14.461
Cutty works for me.

14:14.790 --> 14:15.447
Cutty then.

14:19.632 --> 14:22.177
So, um, it's just
gonna be us here ?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.535
You know...
I mean, Grace.

14:24.883 --> 14:26.442
Sister Grace
called on your behalf

14:26.466 --> 14:28.600
but to my knowledge,
she didn't plan to be here.

14:30.278 --> 14:31.451
She's a beautiful woman.

14:32.366 --> 14:36.116
A man might say things he didn't mean
to stand closer to a woman like that.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.552
You're in the job market
though, I understand.

14:41.666 --> 14:42.616
A couple of questions.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.794
You got a high school diploma ?
G.E.D. ?

14:48.140 --> 14:49.395
Any work experience ?

14:50.968 --> 14:55.950
I worked in a warehouse
for a couple of months back in like '86.

14:56.231 --> 14:57.897
How do you see
the church helping you ?

15:00.407 --> 15:02.239
Maybe give me some jobs or...

15:02.597 --> 15:05.189
put my name on a list or somethin'.
I dunno.

15:05.225 --> 15:07.687
I should tell you up front,
we don't do like that here.

15:07.711 --> 15:09.951
You want a job, you're gonna
have to work to get it.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.848
We'll help.
But it's gonna be your sweat.

15:12.540 --> 15:16.585
With that said, then, the first thing is to
get you enrolled in a G.E.D. program...

15:17.079 --> 15:20.552
Look, I don't mean to put you out,
but this...

15:21.417 --> 15:23.493
this ain't how I thought
it was gonna play.

15:31.955 --> 15:36.448
Me, Oscar, a bunch of the guys,
we seen it.

15:38.243 --> 15:39.147
Couldn't help it.

15:40.401 --> 15:41.995
They practically ran right past us.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.336
And the victim, the girl...
had a gun ?

15:46.415 --> 15:47.517
Whose side was she on ?

15:48.433 --> 15:51.636
Couldn't tell, it weren't
doin' slow motion.

15:51.714 --> 15:54.400
Did any of them have a big scar ?

15:56.781 --> 16:00.219
Do you think you'd be able to recognize
any of them again if you saw them ?

16:00.242 --> 16:02.224
- Just Omar.
- So, you know Omar ?

16:02.284 --> 16:03.702
Omar came up 'round here.

16:05.777 --> 16:07.771
That's good, Bruiser, very good.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.916
You do know Omar
has a scar, right ?

16:11.008 --> 16:11.490
He do ?

16:13.659 --> 16:16.152
I think we better go to my
office, put this down on paper.

16:16.282 --> 16:16.716
Come on.

16:19.873 --> 16:20.388
Officer.

16:21.326 --> 16:22.979
Excuse me, officer.

16:24.329 --> 16:27.655
Is this... North and Pulaski ?

16:28.032 --> 16:31.845
'Cause I could fucking swear
Dozerman was shot up at North and Pulaski.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.117
Wait, wait, lemme guess

16:35.196 --> 16:37.435
the pursuit of your fellow
officer's service weapon

16:37.446 --> 16:38.924
has led you to this fine citizen.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.567
Tell me, kind sir, do you know
the whereabouts of said officer's weapon ?

16:43.119 --> 16:44.104
I didn't think so.

16:44.843 --> 16:46.274
Calls from the detention center.

16:47.447 --> 16:52.350
Some kind souls begging to assist you
in your foundering investigation.

16:57.018 --> 16:59.478
Lemme just grand jury my man here.
Lock in his story.

16:59.759 --> 17:03.620
Now for the gun. Later for his story.
And that's your sergeant talking.

17:23.034 --> 17:24.371
Yo, wipe your nose, yo.

17:25.613 --> 17:27.373
- What the fuck...
- Oh shit !

17:30.152 --> 17:33.227
Motherfucker, you scared the shit
out of us coming up like that.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.053
Shit do make you paranoid, yo.

17:36.851 --> 17:38.117
G'head, nigga, hit this shit.

17:38.142 --> 17:40.277
Naw, man, I gotta
drop urine tomorrow.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.880
Yo, you worried about that ?

17:43.608 --> 17:44.757
Go 'head, nigga.

17:44.851 --> 17:47.268
- We got that covered.
- Oh, you got that covered.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.370
What ?

17:48.711 --> 17:51.080
You think you're the only
motherfucker on parole ?

17:53.048 --> 17:55.511
- Yo, nigger, gimme that shit.
- There you go.

18:06.319 --> 18:06.730
A-ight.

18:07.563 --> 18:08.607
What was her day ?

18:08.877 --> 18:10.835
She caught a hack up
to Towsontown mall.

18:11.657 --> 18:14.570
Hit two jewelry stores and
came back with bags from both.

18:14.945 --> 18:16.788
By the time she
caught up with our boy

18:17.397 --> 18:19.731
she was wearin' one of them
shits around her neck.

18:20.178 --> 18:21.409
Gave the other one to him.

18:21.445 --> 18:23.451
You know, his an' hers, like.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.074
Yeah, Cutty.

18:25.298 --> 18:26.716
You was on that shit, man.

18:34.615 --> 18:35.788
It's been a week, McNulty.

18:35.811 --> 18:38.287
Either you got something
on Stringer or you don't.

18:40.598 --> 18:42.065
He tried to sell me a condo.

18:44.880 --> 18:45.815
Cocksucker.

18:47.691 --> 18:50.612
Might as well join the Rotary.
Take up golf or someshit.

18:51.949 --> 18:53.169
He's runnin' with the hounds

18:53.179 --> 18:55.264
though I'll bet his heart
is still with the fox.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.601
Stringer's out of the game ?

18:57.505 --> 18:59.311
Mr. Bell has become the bank.

19:00.848 --> 19:01.340
The bank ?

19:02.773 --> 19:05.910
The bank plays it legit,
he generates a good bit of honest income.

19:05.922 --> 19:10.661
But at the same time, his money finances
packages that he himself will never touch.

19:11.330 --> 19:12.608
He won't go near the street.

19:12.925 --> 19:15.822
He's insulated from the every day
operations on the corners.

19:16.162 --> 19:18.449
The money that comes back
is then laundered through

19:18.473 --> 19:21.744
enough straight business investments
that there's no way to trace it.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.209
A player gets to that point,
there ain't no way

19:24.220 --> 19:26.942
in hell a working police
is going to tie a can to his tail.

19:27.828 --> 19:28.719
Oh, man.

19:28.977 --> 19:32.004
So, Kintel Williamson,
the prince of Pimlico.

19:33.035 --> 19:34.408
Where we at on this mope ?

19:35.615 --> 19:37.739
DNR's on a couple of payphones.

19:56.051 --> 19:56.849
That got it ?

20:07.428 --> 20:08.014
Alright.

20:09.632 --> 20:11.028
You gonna help or what, boy ?

20:11.650 --> 20:13.526
Might as well not
even take a whistle

20:13.538 --> 20:16.025
if all I'm doin' is
standin' in the fuckin' alley !

20:16.952 --> 20:18.230
Back's where you belong.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.449
That'a way I ain't got to be worryin'
'bout gettin' my damn head blown off

20:22.461 --> 20:23.881
'cause you all scared and shit.

20:24.608 --> 20:25.276
Enough !

20:27.904 --> 20:29.378
You all hear me, I said enough ?!

20:30.247 --> 20:32.968
Come over and put some pumpkin
balls in this shotgun, man.

20:33.355 --> 20:33.953
Kimmy !

20:39.955 --> 20:42.429
Both of y'all learn to live
with it or y'all out, man.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.931
Now, this time
we gonna do it right.

20:50.990 --> 20:51.729
Ya all feel me ?

20:53.301 --> 20:55.730
Boss, you gotta let this go.
It ain't gonna work.

20:56.210 --> 20:58.203
You said it in comstat:
Shit rolls down.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.703
Now, we tried to talk to all the hoppers,
what the hell can they do about anything ?

21:01.731 --> 21:03.595
We need to bring it to the dealers.

21:05.156 --> 21:05.930
Sergeant.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.312
I need a list of names

21:09.322 --> 21:11.488
of all the mid-level dealers
running my corners.

21:13.497 --> 21:14.002
Sir ?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.611
You're my D.E.U. Sergeant, right ?
I need a list of names.

21:18.163 --> 21:20.884
Maybe narcotics downtown has
something like that, I dunno.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.133
We're knocking heads, taking bodies.

21:24.145 --> 21:27.099
I didn't know I was supposed
to be doin' a census or nothing.

21:33.315 --> 21:34.686
Hey, yo, miss. Miss ?

21:35.192 --> 21:36.246
Where the peepot at ?

21:36.787 --> 21:37.139
Thanks.

21:37.561 --> 21:38.441
Come on, this way.

21:41.304 --> 21:43.190
Yo, my man you need
to drop a negative.

21:48.237 --> 21:49.152
Five dollars.

21:50.055 --> 21:51.621
Motherfucker, they was just two.

21:52.043 --> 21:54.893
You try findin' clean piss in Baltimore.
Five a go.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.597
Yo, how I know it's clean ?

21:59.773 --> 22:01.381
I get mine from day care...

22:06.310 --> 22:09.724
I need you to put the chicken
in the oven at 375.

22:10.052 --> 22:11.445
Yes, and after you've done that

22:11.456 --> 22:13.497
I need you to help me
put your sister down...

22:13.510 --> 22:14.378
Excuse me, miss.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.403
Put your thumb on the scanner.

22:21.076 --> 22:22.002
Hold on a second.

22:24.876 --> 22:25.790
What's your name ?

22:26.003 --> 22:28.044
Wise, Dennis Wise.

22:28.455 --> 22:31.141
Take one of those.
Go around the corner to the second door.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.741
No, you can not go outside.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.345
Are you listening
to what I'm saying ?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.550
That's all we got
on the Westside dealers.

23:10.107 --> 23:11.081
George...

23:11.163 --> 23:13.286
I'm lookin' at a sprinklin'
of rap sheets here.

23:13.428 --> 23:15.206
You tellin' me nobody
in this department

23:15.231 --> 23:17.517
knows who controls the West
Baltimore corners anymore ?

23:17.541 --> 23:19.582
Hey, Rawls has my people
doing street rips.

23:19.987 --> 23:22.708
You want up-to-date info,
you should try the intelligence unit.

23:22.731 --> 23:25.803
- Shit, they sent me to you, George.
- What the fuck can I tell you ?

23:25.905 --> 23:27.161
With all the street work

23:27.327 --> 23:29.719
there ain't nobody left
doin' high-end drug stuff.

23:33.352 --> 23:34.420
From what I'm hearing

23:35.193 --> 23:37.023
the guy comes in of his own accord

23:37.105 --> 23:39.179
and he gets betrayed by us.

23:40.011 --> 23:41.863
Protection in this city

23:42.111 --> 23:44.127
amounts to nothing
more than getting dumped

23:44.140 --> 23:46.556
in a fleabag joint on route 40
and calling it a plan.

23:46.568 --> 23:48.805
No monitoring, no assistance.

23:49.157 --> 23:52.208
Nothing just a bundle of
clothes and a toothbrush.

23:53.087 --> 23:53.885
Jesus.

23:54.143 --> 23:55.574
No way to treat a cooperator.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.749
I know someone could get a lot of mileage
out of this with the press.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.859
But fuck that, right ?
Because if I go that way

24:00.884 --> 24:03.159
then everyone gets defensive
and nothing gets fixed.

24:03.183 --> 24:04.989
I'm coming to you
with this straight-up.

24:05.118 --> 24:05.658
Agreed.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.916
Where do we stand on this ?

24:08.246 --> 24:10.158
You've already called
for a meeting on this

24:10.181 --> 24:12.608
with the State's Attorney
and the Police Commissioner.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.471
It's penciled in
for next wednesday.

24:15.518 --> 24:18.011
No, no, Tommy's right on this,
we need to act quickly.

24:18.809 --> 24:20.345
I'm glad you
came to us with this.

24:20.955 --> 24:22.386
I'll light a fire, believe me.

24:23.982 --> 24:24.427
Thanks.

24:28.696 --> 24:30.444
You will keep me
in the loop on this ?

24:30.456 --> 24:32.051
Absolutely, Councilman.

24:48.102 --> 24:50.493
Hey, slow up, girlfriend,
we need to talk for a minute.

24:50.529 --> 24:51.325
Yeah, sweet thin'.

24:51.326 --> 24:51.983
We met before ?

24:51.994 --> 24:53.331
No, baby, but that can happen.

24:53.906 --> 24:56.369
- We ain't met, excuse me.
- Hey, it's just talk, baby.

24:56.394 --> 24:57.390
Get the fuck out, boy.

24:58.150 --> 25:00.237
Look, girl, all we need
for you to do is talk...

25:00.250 --> 25:01.774
Is you deaf or just stone stupid ?

25:01.785 --> 25:02.911
Hold on, girl...

25:07.884 --> 25:08.917
Now, we gonna talk.

25:15.967 --> 25:16.949
How the fuck

25:17.791 --> 25:19.247
is this little runt of a unit

25:19.716 --> 25:21.558
holding all this
drug intelligence ?

25:22.391 --> 25:24.091
I made the rounds
down at headquarters

25:24.092 --> 25:26.285
came up with Jack,
and you're holding all this ?

25:26.679 --> 25:30.246
Well, you run a couple wiretaps,
you fill up a file cabinet pretty fast.

25:31.137 --> 25:32.404
This is great, thanks.

25:34.996 --> 25:36.576
Oh, shit !

25:37.972 --> 25:39.403
Goddamnit.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.297
I heard this was where you landed.

25:43.931 --> 25:45.057
This pretty boy ?

25:45.963 --> 25:47.393
I broke his ass in.

25:48.191 --> 25:51.052
I wrote more on I.I.D. complaints
on bushy top here

25:51.064 --> 25:52.671
than on the whole
goddamn squad.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.173
That is 'til he scuffed himself up.

25:54.876 --> 25:56.109
Now where you at, McNulty ?

25:56.706 --> 25:58.911
1911 South Clinton Street,
first floor.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.301
There you go.

26:05.977 --> 26:07.606
I know you got to keep him close

26:08.088 --> 26:08.732
but still

26:09.471 --> 26:11.221
some good goddamn
police right here.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.230
So what brings you to our shop ?

26:14.654 --> 26:16.788
I'm tryin' to find out
who running my corners.

26:17.973 --> 26:22.242
My own D.E.U. is just about street rips
and headquarters wadn't no help neither.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.049
Y'all saved my ass, though.

26:25.731 --> 26:27.478
You tell him about your boy...
Marlo ?

26:27.700 --> 26:28.769
It's in the files

26:29.168 --> 26:31.560
along with every other
mid-level player we know.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.075
You don't mind me asking ?

26:33.485 --> 26:35.487
What're you gonna do
with all that, Major ?

26:36.297 --> 26:36.860
Well...

26:39.005 --> 26:40.671
round up these young men

26:41.973 --> 26:43.791
and put a little comstat
on they ass.

26:45.297 --> 26:46.810
Gentlemen. Ma'am.

26:47.901 --> 26:48.675
Bushy top.

26:53.391 --> 26:54.107
Bushy top ?

27:02.403 --> 27:03.757
<i>Call to order and shit.</i>

27:03.892 --> 27:06.881
Chair recognize the esteemed rep.
of the Veronica Avenue boys.

27:07.115 --> 27:10.246
Alright, look, we done
talked this shit to death. A-ight ?

27:11.103 --> 27:12.322
When we gonna vote ?

27:12.922 --> 27:14.212
Rick do have a point.

27:14.340 --> 27:15.156
A-ight, then.

27:15.379 --> 27:17.291
All those in favor
of goin' together

27:17.302 --> 27:20.106
so we can get the best
discount on a New York package

27:20.985 --> 27:21.489
raise up.

27:33.915 --> 27:34.572
A-ight then.

27:34.771 --> 27:35.487
There it is.

27:36.394 --> 27:38.236
Look like we gonna
make more money...

27:38.612 --> 27:39.175
together.

27:39.586 --> 27:41.791
Got to say I'm proud
of y'all for puttin' aside

27:41.803 --> 27:44.429
petty grievances an'
puttin' this thing together.

27:45.203 --> 27:46.829
For a cold-ass
crew of gangsters

27:46.830 --> 27:48.836
y'all carried it like
republicans an' shit.

27:49.375 --> 27:52.368
Yo, remember, man,
talk this shit up when you hit them bricks.

27:52.824 --> 27:55.109
Best way to get more
involved is to tell people

27:55.132 --> 27:57.291
about the benefits
of this here thing.

27:57.502 --> 27:59.707
No beefing. No drama.
Just business.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.650
Anybody got a problem
with anybody else here

28:03.049 --> 28:04.192
we bring it to the group.

28:04.626 --> 28:06.257
We ain't gotta take it
to the streets.

28:08.368 --> 28:08.979
A-ight.

28:10.362 --> 28:10.996
Let's do it.

28:15.444 --> 28:15.737
Yo.

28:18.857 --> 28:20.135
Motherfucker, what is that ?

28:20.453 --> 28:23.349
Them Robert rules say we gotta have
minutes for a meeting, right ?

28:23.408 --> 28:24.277
These the minutes.

28:24.757 --> 28:28.695
Nigga, is you takin' notes on
a criminal fucking conspiracy.

28:28.849 --> 28:30.548
What the fuck
is you thinkin', man ?

28:37.424 --> 28:38.221
That's cool.

28:38.644 --> 28:39.676
Dad, he's cheating.

28:40.415 --> 28:42.351
Michael, take it easy
on your brother.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.720
How are you two gettin' along
with mom's new friend ?

28:48.094 --> 28:50.030
We call him Dennis,
he's not new.

28:50.663 --> 28:52.386
Okay, how are you
doin' with him ?

28:52.575 --> 28:54.886
Mom said we can't talk
to you about family stuff.

28:55.169 --> 28:57.174
Dad, you goin' to the open house ?

28:58.336 --> 29:01.960
Yeah, I'll try, but I've been
real busy at work though.

29:02.171 --> 29:03.274
New case an' all.

29:03.497 --> 29:05.570
Mom says you have to go, dad.

29:06.284 --> 29:08.596
Yeah, all the other kids'
fathers are gonna be there.

29:17.706 --> 29:18.644
Get his legs.

29:35.105 --> 29:36.918
Steal from us, motherfucker ?

29:38.561 --> 29:39.617
Get the ring, too, yo.

29:42.218 --> 29:43.321
Shit won't come off, yo.

29:44.258 --> 29:44.810
Drop him.

29:51.187 --> 29:52.888
You know the man works for us.

29:54.073 --> 29:55.959
You keep goin' at him like that

29:55.982 --> 29:58.927
ain't gonna be nothing left of
him to make right what he owes.

30:17.788 --> 30:18.869
Bitch got to pay.

30:20.159 --> 30:21.672
Hey, yo, check his pockets, yo.

30:26.974 --> 30:29.097
- That's mine, yo.
- Get the fuck off...

30:34.598 --> 30:35.659
<i>... to security.</i>

30:35.866 --> 30:36.496
Was' up, baby.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.312
Yo, man, I been in here 26 months

30:48.313 --> 30:50.659
an' you come pick me up
in a motherfuckin' Ford ?

30:54.295 --> 30:55.421
I'm just fuckin' with you.

30:55.445 --> 30:56.243
Was' up, baby ?

30:56.959 --> 30:57.983
What up, man.

30:58.957 --> 31:01.501
Man, I'm feeling real good
to be out of this motherfucker.

31:01.524 --> 31:02.145
You know what ?

31:02.169 --> 31:05.348
There's a sign on the other
side of this gate that say "never again".

31:05.535 --> 31:08.856
And that's the only fucking thin'
I'm gonna take with me from this place.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.033
First thin' first,
let's get you lookin' right.

31:11.044 --> 31:11.960
You know what I mean ?

31:11.971 --> 31:13.097
Oh, you got my shit.

31:15.021 --> 31:15.866
Good looking, baby.

31:29.153 --> 31:30.595
Start with sector one.

31:30.924 --> 31:33.457
Bring as many as you can
down to the Vincent Street area

31:33.480 --> 31:34.360
by the end of shift.

31:34.512 --> 31:36.342
Don't use your wagons.

31:36.836 --> 31:38.650
Bring as many as
you can in your cars.

31:39.295 --> 31:40.586
The hoppers wouldn't listen.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.368
What makes you think
these guys will ?

31:43.213 --> 31:44.187
These are...

31:45.207 --> 31:46.768
the lieutenants running the corners

31:47.729 --> 31:49.763
and I personally feel their pain.

31:50.936 --> 31:53.153
Now, middle-management
means that you have

31:53.704 --> 31:57.003
just enough responsibility
that you got to listen when people talk

31:57.987 --> 31:59.356
and not so much

32:00.189 --> 32:02.992
that you can tell anybody
to go fuck themselves.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.194
Look, my major just wants to talk.

32:31.311 --> 32:33.211
That's all, promise.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.628
We'll bring you right back.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.035
Ain't gonna happen.

32:39.990 --> 32:41.081
The fuck you say ?

32:42.455 --> 32:44.637
What the fuck you mean
it ain't going to happen ?

32:45.224 --> 32:46.948
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

32:46.970 --> 32:48.778
We got orders to bring
your sorry ass down

32:48.800 --> 32:50.432
the way for a sit down
with our boss.

32:50.549 --> 32:52.821
Now we're prepared
to take you with us right now.

32:52.975 --> 32:54.780
We can either do this
the easy way or...

32:54.816 --> 32:56.059
<i>braindead fucks...</i>

32:58.277 --> 32:58.852
<i>Hello.</i>

32:59.122 --> 33:00.072
Prez, it's me.

33:00.494 --> 33:02.336
I think we got
a little situation here.

33:02.768 --> 33:04.598
Stay with me, ten-six...

33:04.621 --> 33:06.721
Major wants the dickhead,
he gotta go.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.037
I think he gets a pass this time.

33:11.588 --> 33:12.385
You sure ?

33:12.550 --> 33:14.563
I mean, you want, he goes.

33:14.986 --> 33:16.052
Another time, Herc.

33:17.602 --> 33:19.103
We're on the Major's clock here.

33:23.391 --> 33:26.352
Don't forget the face, cocksucker,
there's gonna be a tomorrow.

33:32.202 --> 33:33.861
<i>You need me to call dispatch ?</i>

33:33.880 --> 33:35.181
No, it's okay.

33:35.838 --> 33:36.823
I'll tell you later.

33:37.217 --> 33:39.987
I say we get the troops,
and fuck these assholes up.

33:56.806 --> 33:58.015
Come on, let's go again.

33:58.026 --> 33:59.563
C'mon, Tommy, it's just a game.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.700
Look, sounds like you
got what you want, anyway.

34:04.205 --> 34:05.436
From the Mayor, I mean.

34:05.518 --> 34:07.595
Yeah, well, he's played me before

34:08.416 --> 34:09.670
but so help me

34:10.139 --> 34:11.679
if he farts around on this

34:12.454 --> 34:14.318
I'm going after him. Big time.

34:15.268 --> 34:15.937
For real ?

34:16.335 --> 34:17.485
Trust me on this.

34:18.283 --> 34:19.598
He keeps ducking me

34:20.934 --> 34:22.353
I'm going to fuck him good.

34:25.027 --> 34:26.036
That's the good part.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.489
It's what I call the carrot.

34:29.099 --> 34:31.375
Now you move your people
into any designated area

34:31.397 --> 34:32.136
I told you about

34:32.743 --> 34:35.358
and you have immunity from
arrest and prosecution.

34:35.746 --> 34:37.118
You're free to make your drops

34:37.235 --> 34:38.525
collect what needs collectin'

34:38.947 --> 34:40.251
and won't nobody bother you.

34:40.697 --> 34:41.964
You've got my word on it.

34:43.925 --> 34:45.320
What do you get out of this ?

34:46.177 --> 34:47.350
That's a fair question.

34:47.795 --> 34:50.632
I want to salvage what's still
worth salvagin' in my district.

34:50.821 --> 34:53.518
And I can't do that with a bunch
of young hoppers runnin' around

34:53.532 --> 34:55.335
scarin' the hell
out of the decent people.

34:55.357 --> 34:58.537
Now, these kids ain't gonna listen to me,
but they will listen to y'all.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.965
Now, you tell them to move
down here and set-up shop

35:00.990 --> 35:01.669
and they will.

35:01.904 --> 35:03.324
So the way I got it figured

35:03.958 --> 35:07.188
I motivate you,
and you motivate them.

35:08.184 --> 35:09.347
Naw, this a trap.

35:09.722 --> 35:11.082
No, you check out the spot.

35:12.008 --> 35:14.754
There ain't no cameras,
ain't no microphones, nothing.

35:15.759 --> 35:18.435
Any cops you see going to be
down right on the perimeter.

35:18.844 --> 35:20.721
Just to make sure
there's no violence.

35:21.637 --> 35:22.505
And you watch

35:23.268 --> 35:25.320
you see if it don't
work out the way I say.

35:26.356 --> 35:28.854
Nothin' personal
against you, chief, but...

35:30.262 --> 35:31.445
what happens if we buck ?

35:32.702 --> 35:34.238
You remember the carrot, right ?

35:36.739 --> 35:38.510
Well, if you choose
the stick instead

35:39.226 --> 35:41.984
you gonna feel that stick like
you ain't never felt before.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.632
We gonna indict
every corner, every day.

35:46.196 --> 35:48.714
I've got over 200 sworn
personnel and I plan to free up

35:48.726 --> 35:52.057
every one of them to knock every
one of you y'all down they can.

35:52.924 --> 35:54.555
If you're on a corner in my district

35:55.013 --> 35:56.514
it ain't gonna be about no humble

35:56.549 --> 35:59.443
it ain't gonna be about
no loitering charge, nothing like that.

36:00.264 --> 36:03.011
There gonna be some biblical
shit happening to you on the way

36:03.045 --> 36:05.368
to that motherfuckin' jail wagon.
You understand me ?

36:05.392 --> 36:07.265
And while you're
buckin' the new system,

36:07.276 --> 36:09.411
the smart ones among you,
gonna be down here

36:09.856 --> 36:10.794
makin' money

36:11.405 --> 36:12.284
hand over fist.

36:14.643 --> 36:15.592
So, think it over.

36:16.847 --> 36:18.368
But I swear to god, come monday

36:19.167 --> 36:21.232
your world and mine
ain't gonna be the same.

36:30.669 --> 36:33.320
I thought you said these
goddamn houses were vacant.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.350
We musta missed her.

36:36.382 --> 36:38.259
There's one more thing
I gotta do then.

36:55.516 --> 36:59.034
Little Man, up on "b" tier,
one of his boys in the dormitory

36:59.924 --> 37:03.538
his brother's tight with the girlfriend
of the boy that shot that poh-leece.

37:04.148 --> 37:05.344
Little Man sayin'

37:06.107 --> 37:07.714
if you sprung the three of us

37:07.878 --> 37:11.226
we could get her talkin',
you know, find the gun.

37:13.130 --> 37:15.580
I'm hearin' the boy, Dink,
got that man's gun.

37:16.156 --> 37:20.575
Now, I ain't sure yet if that
Dink be Dink Dink or Inky Dink

37:20.621 --> 37:21.829
or maybe Fat Dink.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.727
Then again,
it might be Flat Nose Dink.

37:25.057 --> 37:25.761
No, wait

37:27.657 --> 37:29.077
that can't
be him, that Dink dead.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.809
Look, man, I can help you

37:32.079 --> 37:34.753
but first you gotta get me out
from under these murder beefs.

37:35.034 --> 37:36.384
How many murders we talkin' ?

37:41.249 --> 37:44.311
Look, man, do it have
to be the cop's gun ?

37:44.734 --> 37:47.420
'Cause if it's guns you want,
I can get you guns.

37:58.384 --> 37:59.322
I remember this.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.184
Sixth grade.
Mrs. Holley's science class.

38:03.309 --> 38:05.117
Box lunches. Taste like shit.

38:05.809 --> 38:07.474
You got somethin'
so important, man

38:07.497 --> 38:09.409
you can't go through
the proper channels ?

38:09.421 --> 38:10.031
Well, no.

38:11.310 --> 38:12.155
I don't know.

38:13.316 --> 38:15.568
I just figured if
I told anybody but you

38:15.592 --> 38:17.293
you might think
I'm ridin' the rock.

38:17.914 --> 38:19.462
What makes me think you ain't ?

38:20.646 --> 38:22.347
Yeah, right.
That's a good point.

38:22.477 --> 38:26.055
Look, today, me,
Tuckie, Little Mikey

38:26.982 --> 38:27.885
man, we all...

38:27.898 --> 38:29.867
A bunch of us got
scooped up by the police.

38:32.073 --> 38:33.468
Well, you shouldn't sell drugs.

38:41.543 --> 38:42.359
Alright, alright.

38:44.264 --> 38:46.266
Nah see, they didn't
take us to the station.

38:46.279 --> 38:48.613
They took us down to the
bottom of Vincent Street

38:48.635 --> 38:51.181
where all the houses is boarded
up, and they let us out.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.892
And then, on top of all of that

38:52.917 --> 38:55.110
like the whole while they
were being all like...

38:55.860 --> 38:58.405
decent and shit,
you know that fucked me up.

38:59.999 --> 39:02.405
And then the police chief,
he come out.

39:02.792 --> 39:04.406
And this is the crazy part

39:04.417 --> 39:07.587
he say that he got it set up
so that we could sell stuff

39:08.372 --> 39:11.328
in certain spots,
and the police won't bother us.

39:12.713 --> 39:17.874
I know, I know. It's fucked up,
but I just thought you should know.

39:21.633 --> 39:22.220
That's it ?

39:22.619 --> 39:25.140
Yeah, just that,
and the boy Marlo.

39:27.393 --> 39:28.120
Yeah, I'm on it.

39:31.487 --> 39:31.920
Yep.

39:52.110 --> 39:53.670
2303 to K.G.A.

39:55.517 --> 39:57.639
Have foxtrot meet me
on six, adam.

39:59.668 --> 40:00.713
<i>Foxtrot, ten four.</i>

40:00.877 --> 40:02.483
2303 to foxtrot.

40:02.523 --> 40:03.992
<i>Foxtrot, standing by.</i>

40:04.120 --> 40:06.138
It's a black Mercedes,
pulling out the lot.

40:06.161 --> 40:07.887
<i>Copy that, we got the eyeball.</i>

40:25.499 --> 40:26.508
This here the spot ?

40:26.872 --> 40:29.827
'Cause Tuckie says we supposed
to set-up shop here.

40:30.836 --> 40:31.692
Hamsterdam.

40:32.549 --> 40:33.710
Yeah, this is it.

40:33.898 --> 40:37.017
Set-up anywhere inside where
we got the white flags.

40:43.985 --> 40:47.035
- Yo, I'm getting ready to roll out.
- You just got here, what's wrong ?

40:47.047 --> 40:48.349
Ain't nobody 'round to buy.

40:50.742 --> 40:51.423
Good point.

40:55.199 --> 40:56.349
Man needs customers.

40:56.513 --> 40:57.967
- I'm sayin'...
- Aw, no.

40:58.425 --> 41:01.283
You can't make me.
I'm a sworn fucking police officer.

41:17.966 --> 41:20.018
Was' up, man.
You got that bodybag still ?

41:20.811 --> 41:21.151
Two.

41:23.427 --> 41:23.872
Narco !

41:30.377 --> 41:31.574
Give it up, motherfucker.

41:31.713 --> 41:33.110
Money comes back, right now.

41:37.121 --> 41:38.318
Boss, you fuckin' up, man.

41:38.340 --> 41:40.464
You didn't even let me cop
'fore you snatch me up.

41:40.487 --> 41:41.742
Is that some fuckin' rule ?

41:43.905 --> 41:45.019
You call, we haul.

41:46.756 --> 41:47.249
You clean ?

41:47.460 --> 41:48.692
Yeah, of course I'm clean

41:48.704 --> 41:51.132
stupid ass rookie didn't
even give me a chance to cop.

41:51.483 --> 41:52.523
This corner's indicted.

41:52.535 --> 41:55.608
You move over to Vincent Street
or we come back with the bracelets.

42:23.112 --> 42:23.857
<i>What you got ?</i>

42:23.873 --> 42:25.868
1011 me at Riggs and Calhoun.

42:27.615 --> 42:32.153
Despite unforeseen delays,
we will begin an academy class

42:32.165 --> 42:36.493
this january, which leaves us in
good shape for the coming year.

42:37.677 --> 42:39.135
Thank you, Commissioner.

42:39.463 --> 42:41.807
If the chair pleases,
I have a couple of questions.

42:43.322 --> 42:44.166
Commissioner

42:44.260 --> 42:46.300
I know you are aware
that a state's witness

42:46.324 --> 42:48.553
in a recent city homicide
prosecution was killed.

42:51.650 --> 42:54.337
We are treating that incident
with the highest priority.

42:54.571 --> 42:56.355
Homicide has set-up a task force

42:56.624 --> 42:58.806
and narcotics is working
the informant angle.

42:59.627 --> 43:03.018
We have also asked both the
F.B.I. and D.E.A. for support.

43:03.182 --> 43:04.824
It sounds like a full-court press

43:05.329 --> 43:06.290
but you must admit

43:06.314 --> 43:09.082
it's a bit like closing the barn
door after the horse is out.

43:09.846 --> 43:11.745
I mean, the shooting
of the boy on the lot

43:11.757 --> 43:13.984
at Lake Clifton high school
was a high-profile case

43:14.008 --> 43:15.217
wasn't it, Commissioner ?

43:16.295 --> 43:17.468
Yes, it was.

43:17.492 --> 43:19.510
And yet a key witness
in the case was allowed...

43:20.612 --> 43:21.269
one moment...

43:26.263 --> 43:28.656
excuse me, Commissioner,
but the chair was good enough

43:28.681 --> 43:30.885
to remind me that you have
a pressing engagement.

43:31.179 --> 43:34.365
So if it's alright with you,
we can continue this at a later date.

43:34.717 --> 43:35.831
Meeting adjourned.

43:41.274 --> 43:42.588
Did you see Burrell sweat ?

43:43.387 --> 43:44.817
The man's collar almost melted.

43:45.087 --> 43:46.212
The hell got into you ?

43:46.858 --> 43:48.159
You did, old buddy.

43:48.805 --> 43:49.322
You did.

44:05.067 --> 44:07.391
Nend of the line, all out.

44:10.637 --> 44:12.046
We got that Rockefeller, yo.

44:12.479 --> 44:14.227
We got that Rockefeller
over here, yo.

44:14.755 --> 44:16.456
Over here we got that
Rockefeller, yo.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.289
Whatta fuck ?

44:19.672 --> 44:21.748
Yo, yo, we got
the Rockefeller, yo.

44:23.167 --> 44:26.018
We got that W.M.D.
right here, right here.

44:26.065 --> 44:28.117
I hear the W.M.D. is the bomb.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.178
W.M.D. right here.

44:36.548 --> 44:37.588
W.M.D.

44:40.733 --> 44:42.140
Give me two, yo.

44:43.349 --> 44:45.225
W.M.D. right here.

44:46.647 --> 44:48.924
W.M.D. right here, right here.

44:51.650 --> 44:52.320
Right here.

44:54.514 --> 44:56.062
We got that Rockefeller over here.

44:57.023 --> 44:57.352
Yo !

44:58.795 --> 45:00.121
We got that Rockefeller, yo.

45:05.678 --> 45:06.441
What do we got ?

45:06.757 --> 45:08.375
There's binoculars on the floor.

45:15.085 --> 45:16.235
Marlo making a move ?

45:16.727 --> 45:17.690
Just watch.

45:18.933 --> 45:20.974
Forget everythin'
the boy, Bodie, told you.

45:22.065 --> 45:24.164
Forget the beatin',
it ain't about that.

45:26.555 --> 45:28.197
You smart, man, I can see that.

45:29.651 --> 45:32.162
I wanted you to choose
somewhere safe for us to speak.

45:32.197 --> 45:33.194
But goddamn

45:35.060 --> 45:37.555
only bugs in this
motherfucker gotta have legs.

45:40.076 --> 45:41.355
Now, I appreciate smart

45:42.105 --> 45:44.698
but you gotta know,
in this game, man, it ain't enough.

45:45.249 --> 45:46.410
You a student of history ?

45:47.105 --> 45:50.072
You know this town had its
share of smart players, man ?

45:51.058 --> 45:55.773
Melvin, Little Wil, Big Head Brother,
Peanut, Warren.

45:56.436 --> 45:59.004
All real smart, man, real smart.

46:00.049 --> 46:03.006
You know, soon as
their names rang out, bam

46:03.703 --> 46:04.724
the feds was on them.

46:06.260 --> 46:08.861
You know what I mean ?
The government they want you to be

46:08.890 --> 46:11.465
organized, nah, they want you
scrimpin' and scrapin'

46:11.488 --> 46:13.916
killin' each other on the
corners over some bullshit.

46:14.328 --> 46:15.032
Not me.

46:15.653 --> 46:16.833
That's why me and Prop Joe

46:16.845 --> 46:18.934
we gettin' ready to put
this co-op together.

46:19.449 --> 46:22.394
Different crews, one package.
Best dope, best coke.

46:23.555 --> 46:24.776
Share and share alike.

46:25.619 --> 46:26.878
I've been hearin' 'bout that.

46:26.890 --> 46:28.262
You've been hearin' 'bout that ?

46:28.285 --> 46:30.514
That's good,
that's a start, right ?

46:31.041 --> 46:33.647
You know that Mercedes you
got ridin' out there, man

46:33.753 --> 46:36.791
you got that titled in your
aunt's name or some shit.

46:38.655 --> 46:40.029
Now, when they come get you

46:40.567 --> 46:43.783
that straw purchase out there
gonna come bite you in the ass, boy.

46:44.966 --> 46:46.010
That's what's they do.

46:46.620 --> 46:47.887
Turn your money against you.

46:49.129 --> 46:51.862
Now, you I'm thinkin'
with the corners you got

46:53.164 --> 46:54.491
you close to a mil, right ?

46:55.476 --> 46:56.461
I'm doin' a-ight.

46:56.696 --> 46:57.752
You doing a-ight

46:58.595 --> 47:01.185
but a-ight ain't got you
a name on your crib, right ?

47:02.288 --> 47:04.927
Ain't got you a little spot
to wash that dirty money ?

47:06.816 --> 47:08.282
That what I'm offerin' you, man.

47:13.352 --> 47:14.678
Come on, who's he in there with ?

47:14.889 --> 47:16.696
I told you, keep watchin'.

47:18.443 --> 47:19.898
Did Bunk put you
up to this ?

47:20.714 --> 47:23.119
Tell you what, how about
a case of that PBR piss

47:23.131 --> 47:26.264
you drink against a touch of the
Irish that he went out the back

47:26.274 --> 47:28.328
and you're watching
that house for nothing.

47:29.606 --> 47:30.862
Here comes your nothing.

47:39.515 --> 47:41.192
I like my piss in bottles.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.644
Anyway you like, darlin'.

47:48.654 --> 47:49.522
Chris...

47:51.139 --> 47:52.595
tell our people to tool up.

47:55.232 --> 47:56.065
I'm on it.

48:05.034 --> 48:07.355
I got that W.M.D., got that W.M.D.

48:12.399 --> 48:14.411
They got comfortable
with it pretty quick.

48:14.915 --> 48:17.016
Yeah, it's like we ain't
even standing here.

48:17.544 --> 48:19.444
The hoppers call it Hamsterdam.

48:21.039 --> 48:22.001
Like from Amsterdam.

48:24.076 --> 48:24.969
Hamsterdam.

48:29.690 --> 48:32.446
...are the use of integrated
math concepts such as

48:32.469 --> 48:35.966
algebraic reasoning, and number
sines, geometry and probability.

48:36.301 --> 48:37.451
Very impressive.

48:37.568 --> 48:40.054
Now what we try to do is
keep the class size under 10

48:40.084 --> 48:41.052
12 at the very most.

48:41.063 --> 48:43.397
- And there are three levels ?
- Yes, so that if...

48:43.504 --> 48:45.321
Sorry, I'm Jim McNulty.

48:45.381 --> 48:47.156
I'm runnin' a little late
because of work.

48:47.169 --> 48:48.142
Mr. McNulty.

48:49.185 --> 48:52.223
I have some concerns about
the integrated math program.

48:52.248 --> 48:55.777
In their previous schools,
Michael took introductory algebra

48:55.789 --> 48:58.437
but I understand that this school
is doing something different.

48:58.461 --> 49:00.067
We are.
The integrated math program...

49:00.080 --> 49:01.135
Excuse me, I'm thirsty

49:01.147 --> 49:03.177
can I get either of you
somethin' to drink ?

49:03.833 --> 49:05.850
The integrated math
program here consist...

49:13.756 --> 49:17.005
Not much of a spread, but you
can't go wrong with crudite.

49:17.569 --> 49:18.273
Crudity ?

49:20.537 --> 49:22.801
I'm sorry, you know,
I came straight from work

49:22.824 --> 49:23.657
or I'da changed.

49:23.715 --> 49:25.100
No need to call names, right ?

49:26.754 --> 49:28.325
What do you do, Mr...

49:28.983 --> 49:30.380
I'm on the board at Legg Mason.

49:30.697 --> 49:31.682
Jim McNulty.

49:32.797 --> 49:33.582
Legg Mason ?

49:34.357 --> 49:36.986
Either that or I'm a cop
in the city, I keep forgetting.

49:39.996 --> 49:41.732
Terri d'Agostino.

49:42.331 --> 49:45.848
I'm an alumna and one of
the school's dreaded fundraisers.

49:47.619 --> 49:50.493
The math program offers
tutoring possibilities.

49:50.743 --> 49:52.644
So if Michael finds it
difficult adjusting

49:52.937 --> 49:55.776
we can have classes
on tuesdays and thursdays.

49:56.610 --> 49:58.193
So how do you find the school ?

49:58.428 --> 49:58.885
It's good.

50:00.034 --> 50:02.330
My ex and I are thinking
of sending our boys here.

50:03.608 --> 50:06.236
- Any problems, difficulties ?
- No, not really.

50:06.718 --> 50:10.643
I mean, there's the math
integration class for my oldest.

50:10.902 --> 50:13.319
He's in sixth, seventh, and...

50:14.702 --> 50:17.165
I'm not sure he's ready,
you know, for all that math.

50:44.215 --> 50:46.032
Careful, I'm only a country boy.

50:46.045 --> 50:47.558
Shut up !

51:04.559 --> 51:05.973
<i>Hey, sweetie, welcome home.</i>

51:20.060 --> 51:20.810
Welcome back.

51:23.002 --> 51:23.859
Hey, sis.

51:24.762 --> 51:25.725
Aw, man.

51:26.769 --> 51:29.467
I just wish I wasn't the only
one comin' home, you know ?

51:30.695 --> 51:31.341
I know.

51:32.959 --> 51:34.941
Enjoy tonight, we'll talk later.

51:37.401 --> 51:37.999
Welcome home.

51:38.022 --> 51:39.736
What up, Prop,
how you feelin', man ?

51:39.760 --> 51:40.147
Alright.

51:40.873 --> 51:41.929
You lookin' fit.

51:42.563 --> 51:44.509
Hell, yeah, I've been
working out in there.

51:44.522 --> 51:45.777
All you gotta do is work out.

51:45.805 --> 51:48.808
Might be a good place for a fat
man to find his inner-self.

52:15.869 --> 52:16.350
Yo.

52:17.580 --> 52:20.514
I got some downtown suits wanna
hollar with you real quick.

52:21.921 --> 52:24.666
Takin' me to see suits,
I'm tryin' to see some skirts.

52:37.387 --> 52:38.254
So what do you do ?

52:40.681 --> 52:41.771
You should get dressed.

52:45.395 --> 52:46.991
I got a lot of work here.

52:47.237 --> 52:48.832
It's a long day for me tomorrow.

52:52.031 --> 52:53.158
I'll be really quiet.

52:57.344 --> 52:59.550
You never know, you might
get bored workin'.

53:00.733 --> 53:01.485
I gotta work.

53:05.227 --> 53:05.907
You gotta go...

53:13.887 --> 53:16.666
What Stringer's done with
all that property downtown

53:16.690 --> 53:20.045
Avon, I cannot tell the kind
of profit you're looking at

53:20.068 --> 53:22.393
once all the federal
redevelopment money lands.

53:22.631 --> 53:24.836
That whole howard street
thing is gonna take off

53:24.848 --> 53:27.370
and you're gonna be right
there to cut the pie yourself.

53:27.393 --> 53:30.490
Any dollar you spend now
is going to come back to you ten times.

53:30.772 --> 53:31.992
And the thing is ?

53:32.214 --> 53:34.395
I know you don't wanna
go back to them streets.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.214
Not after what you been through.

53:36.425 --> 53:39.111
I know, because I'm from
those same streets.

53:39.463 --> 53:41.775
And once I had the chance
to play a different game

53:41.798 --> 53:43.874
there wasn't a question
in my mind how to go.

53:44.027 --> 53:46.499
The government is going to be
looking at you hard, too.

53:46.522 --> 53:48.785
No sense in giving them
what they're looking for.

53:48.809 --> 53:50.757
You take what you have,
you build on it.

53:50.956 --> 53:53.490
It's all good.
Just put it up on the calendar.

53:53.801 --> 53:54.739
We should meet.

53:59.337 --> 54:00.345
Yo, Slim.

54:00.944 --> 54:02.811
You see the two niggas right there.

54:03.057 --> 54:05.527
They over here gettin' high
in the middle of all this...

54:05.985 --> 54:07.815
where the fucking
discipline at, yo ?

54:09.176 --> 54:10.853
Fuck, toss them niggers.

54:32.385 --> 54:33.476
Talk to me for a second.

54:33.487 --> 54:35.575
don't you know not
to stare at me like that.

54:36.052 --> 54:39.277
Yo. I got to show you something.

54:39.981 --> 54:41.025
Pardon me, sweetie.

54:41.048 --> 54:41.752
Hey, yo, man.

54:41.776 --> 54:43.501
You know I've been locked down.

54:44.261 --> 54:46.173
You gonna love this.
Trust me.

55:03.806 --> 55:06.173
Ah, shit, this ain't
my little place down in jessup.

55:06.195 --> 55:09.328
But you know what I mean,
what the fuck is, right ?

55:09.410 --> 55:10.640
This is all you, B.

55:11.392 --> 55:13.526
All you, in your name, too.

55:14.679 --> 55:15.664
You know what I mean ?

55:15.675 --> 55:17.835
This piece of paper right
here makes it legit.

55:19.477 --> 55:21.495
Keys to the navigator,
in the basement.

55:21.588 --> 55:23.994
It's just a rental 'til
you pick out somethin' nice.

55:25.151 --> 55:26.547
Damn, all this, huh ?

55:27.169 --> 55:28.118
You did good.

55:29.010 --> 55:31.544
Yeah, I mean we're makin'
so much straight money, man

55:31.567 --> 55:34.981
we can carry shit like this out
