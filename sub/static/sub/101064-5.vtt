Instead of sending GEDmatch

we could upload a new type

ARI: ...the first
Mother's Day without her,

26:12.565 --> 26:14.232
the first birthday without her.

26:14.315 --> 26:15.565

26:15.649 --> 26:18.357

That's the conundrum.

26:20.273 --> 26:24.565
Overall, 2017 is awful
because at least in 2016,

26:24.649 --> 26:29.357
I had three months and 21 days
of Michelle being in there.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.148
And now, this is a year
where there's no Michelle.

26:32.232 --> 26:33.649
Like, that's it.

26:33.732 --> 26:35.899
So, when January 1st dawned,

26:35.982 --> 26:38.232
it felt like a cell door
slamming behind me.

26:38.315 --> 26:40.273

in this awful world

even have a memory of her

mere days before her death.

the conversation in my mind

that may have indicated

27:19.357 --> 27:21.732

28:10.273 --> 28:13.482
in order to try to understand
what happened.

28:15.148 --> 28:17.607
You know, right on the top
of the autopsy,

28:17.691 --> 28:21.649
it says, "From the, uh,
anatomic findings

28:21.732 --> 28:24.315
and pertinent history,
I ascribe to the death

28:24.399 --> 28:28.691
as... A,
effects of multiple drugs."

28:28.774 --> 28:32.190
And then under D
down below, it says,

28:32.273 --> 28:35.691
"Other conditions contributing
but not related

28:35.774 --> 28:37.982
to the immediate cause of death"

28:38.065 --> 28:40.148
is the heart issue,

28:40.232 --> 28:42.273
the cardiovascular disease.

28:42.357 --> 28:45.399
So really that was not
gonna kill her.

28:45.482 --> 28:47.774
That could not have been
a cause of death.

28:50.649 --> 28:52.857
When I was younger,
I had a surgery

28:52.941 --> 28:57.357
and got addicted
to opiate prescription pills.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.107
I had to seek recovery
from that.

29:01.649 --> 29:05.065
So I wish I could've
recognized that happening

29:05.148 --> 29:07.691
because I feel like,
uh, you know,

29:07.774 --> 29:10.899

would, uh, make me a good person

29:10.982 --> 29:14.107
to have communicated with her
and maybe tried to help her.

29:17.982 --> 29:20.065
She had Adderall,

29:20.148 --> 29:21.774
opiates, fentanyl,

29:21.857 --> 29:23.315
uh, Xanax.

29:28.482 --> 29:30.107
No doctor prescribed

29:30.190 --> 29:32.482
that amount of pills to her
like this.

29:34.065 --> 29:36.190
Oftentimes, you have
to turn to drugs

29:36.273 --> 29:38.816
that are being sold
under the table,

29:38.899 --> 29:42.649
and you don't know exactly
what's in the drug.

29:42.732 --> 29:45.816
And that's where we're seeing
a lot of the counterfeit drugs

29:45.899 --> 29:47.982
that are cut with fentanyl.

29:49.232 --> 29:51.857
Fentanyl's 100 times
stronger than morphine.

29:52.857 --> 29:55.190
A little tiny bit of fentanyl

29:55.273 --> 29:58.023
would kill the average person
if they just took it.

29:59.482 --> 30:01.440
That's one of the reasons
we're seeing a spike

30:01.524 --> 30:03.649

I don't know.

30:40.524 --> 30:43.232

that she said it so casually

like, "I'm just doing that,"

to come up with nine men

38:45.691 --> 38:47.565
who were in California,

38:47.649 --> 38:49.899
who were approximately
the right age.

38:51.524 --> 38:53.565

there was one individual

38:53.649 --> 38:55.982
who-- who's living in Colorado

38:56.065 --> 38:57.607

38:57.691 --> 38:59.982
He was somebody that was
in the construction industry.

39:00.065 --> 39:02.440
He had two uncles
living in Cordova Meadows

39:02.524 --> 39:04.565
at the time those attacks
were occurring there.

39:04.649 --> 39:06.649
And when one of those uncles
moves down to Stockton,

39:06.732 --> 39:08.482
now you have
the East Area Rapist

39:08.565 --> 39:12.273

And that uncle bought a house

39:12.357 --> 39:14.565

HOLES: After we eliminated
the guy in Colorado,

51:16.816 --> 51:19.190
we only had a handful of males
that were--

51:19.273 --> 51:22.148
we ended up having
to kind of look at.

51:22.232 --> 51:25.273
BARBARA: I was also doing
a lot of stuff with newspapers.

51:25.357 --> 51:29.232
And one of--
one of the news articles

51:29.315 --> 51:34.357
that turned up was the arrest
of a police officer

51:34.440 --> 51:38.315
shoplifting dog repellant
and a hammer in Citrus Heights.

51:39.399 --> 51:40.857
I remember looking at it
and thinking,

51:40.941 --> 51:42.565
"This guy looks awfully good."

51:42.649 --> 51:45.816
And so I immediately sent off
an email to Paul Holes,

51:45.899 --> 51:47.982
saying,
"Has this guy been ruled out?"

51:50.148 --> 51:51.399
And he hadn't.

51:51.482 --> 51:53.899
He was in our hotlist
of six people

51:53.982 --> 51:55.524
that was left at the end.

HAYNES: I immediately
opened my master list.

52:05.816 --> 52:08.982
I didn't have anybody
that met those characteristics.

(MESSAGE PINGS)

52:11.691 --> 52:13.816
You know,
I've heard this before,

52:13.899 --> 52:16.649
so I kinda took it
with a grain of salt.

52:16.732 --> 52:19.065
But now, I'm, like,
waiting for updates.

52:21.440 --> 52:24.023
HOLES: I wanted to look
at this guy closer.

52:24.107 --> 52:26.691
And so I drove
and parked on the curb

52:26.774 --> 52:29.732
opposite from his house
and sat there.

52:29.816 --> 52:32.857
And I started thinking about,
"What do we know about him?"

52:35.065 --> 52:37.357
And I started thinking about
the ex-fiancée

52:37.440 --> 52:39.065
with first name of Bonnie.

52:40.357 --> 52:42.982
He had also purchased a gun

52:43.065 --> 52:46.357
down in a town
right outside of Visalia.

52:47.941 --> 52:50.899
And then in 1985, '86,

52:50.982 --> 52:54.107
he had a daughter born
down in Los Angeles County.

52:54.190 --> 52:56.982
And so his geographic
connections

52:57.065 --> 52:58.857
were looking pretty good.

53:00.107 --> 53:02.148
BARBARA:
I'd also run the profile

53:02.232 --> 53:05.065
through another site
called Promethease,

53:05.148 --> 53:08.399
and I determined that the person
that we were looking for

53:08.482 --> 53:09.524
had blue eyes.

53:09.607 --> 53:12.482
And it also said he would be
prematurely bald.

53:12.565 --> 53:15.357
So at that point,
law enforcement then pulls

53:15.440 --> 53:17.065
the California
driver's license records

53:17.148 --> 53:19.148
for the six people
on our list.

53:20.065 --> 53:22.065
Only one man has blue eyes,

53:23.107 --> 53:24.607
Joseph DeAngelo.

(MESSAGES PING)

53:38.232 --> 53:39.607
He's in custody.

Okay. He's in custody."

53:48.148 --> 53:50.524
I remember wandering
through the room like a zombie,

just like, "Is he caught?"
What just happened?"

HOLES: It's crazy.

54:01.941 --> 54:05.023
After four decades of searching
for this guy,

54:05.107 --> 54:07.607
it came down to testing
a piece of tissue

54:07.691 --> 54:09.482
from his trashcan outside.

54:12.232 --> 54:16.524
It was a 100% match to
the Golden State Killer's DNA.

-BILLY: All right, Patton.
-Hmm?

54:22.816 --> 54:25.232
BILLY: I just texted you.
You heard the news.

54:25.315 --> 54:27.357
-Yes.
-BILLY: What are you thinking?

54:27.440 --> 54:32.107
I'm thinking
way too much stuff right now.

54:32.399 --> 54:33.482
Um...

54:34.482 --> 54:37.524
I just, you know,
I-- I-- I would--

54:37.607 --> 54:39.399
I wish you were pointing
that camera

54:39.482 --> 54:41.524
at Michelle right now,
and not me.

54:42.857 --> 54:45.357
I hope they got him.
I hope she got him.
