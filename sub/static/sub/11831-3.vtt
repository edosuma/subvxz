- We don't go around killing

Are you telling them
that you equate her cancer
with a kidney stone?

Yes.

11:28.914 --> 11:30.983
You spoke of your pain...

11:31.049 --> 11:35.054
having to watch your wife
deteriorate this way.

11:35.122 --> 11:39.560
Would it be fair to say
this pain was immense for you?
It would be fair.

11:39.627 --> 11:42.097
Have you ever been through
anything more painful?

11:42.164 --> 11:43.933
No.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.935
I hate to ask this, sir,

11:46.002 --> 11:50.674
but can we really be sure
<i>you</i> were of sound mind
through all this?

12:02.323 --> 12:05.093
Let's make it quick.
I'm a busy man.

12:06.962 --> 12:09.165
Twenty times on the Patriots,

12:09.232 --> 12:13.538
times two on the Steelers,
Cowboys and Dolphins each,

12:13.604 --> 12:17.208
10 times on
the Raiders.

12:19.045 --> 12:24.952
Detective, does that videotape
accurately reflect the events
of December 19, 1996?

12:25.018 --> 12:28.189
It does.
You placed bets
with Mr. Malzone...

12:28.256 --> 12:30.492
on national league
football games?

12:30.559 --> 12:32.495
I did.

12:32.562 --> 12:34.397
Yours.

12:34.464 --> 12:36.733
You actually put money
on the Raiders?

12:36.800 --> 12:39.471
Well, it wasn't about trying
to win the bet, counsel.

12:40.572 --> 12:42.508
Clearly.

12:42.575 --> 12:44.510
[ Laughing ]

12:45.912 --> 12:48.615
Did Mr. Malzone solicit you in
any way to make these wagers...

12:48.683 --> 12:51.019
- <i>or did you go to him?</i>
- I went to him.

12:51.086 --> 12:54.690
Part of a big sting
to get big fish in
a big organized gaming mob.

12:54.756 --> 12:57.594
- Wasn't that it?
- Basically.

12:57.660 --> 13:01.432
And is this the fish you were
looking to get, or were you
looking to trade up?

13:01.499 --> 13:03.602
The latter.

13:06.138 --> 13:08.474
There's no point putting
the daughter up.
You don't know what I'll ask.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.310
I know you'll be putting
the law on trial.

13:10.376 --> 13:12.113
Her testimony will go to
the facts of this case.

13:12.179 --> 13:15.417
It'll be a tearjerk fest,
we all know that,
with nothing relevant.

13:15.483 --> 13:18.754
Say that to the jury. "Nothing
relevant" to the daughter
whose mother died of cancer.

13:18.821 --> 13:22.326
<i>That's exactly the type</i>
<i>of pandering--</i>
<i>Quiet now.</i>

13:22.392 --> 13:25.396
<i>I have a question.</i>
<i>You ever talk?</i>

13:25.463 --> 13:27.732
Do I need to?

13:27.799 --> 13:31.403
<i>Look, the witness has</i>
<i>no relevant testimony</i>
<i>which goes to the issue.</i>

13:31.470 --> 13:35.308
I'd ask you to rule not
from your heart but your head.
I'd settle for your bladder.

13:35.375 --> 13:38.012
Cute.

13:38.079 --> 13:40.582
Look, she's right.
This is a reach.

13:40.649 --> 13:43.819
This is a criminal case.

13:43.886 --> 13:46.523
- I should get some rope.
- Don't hang yourself with it.

13:47.858 --> 13:50.862
- I won't.
- <i>Short leash.</i>

13:50.928 --> 13:53.131
The daughter can testify.

13:53.198 --> 13:55.401
The bladder crack cost you.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.076
What?

14:02.142 --> 14:04.412
You seem a little crisp.

14:04.479 --> 14:07.249
Know what? All these
murder trials we're gettin',

14:07.316 --> 14:10.053
they started pourin' in
after we got Gerald Braun off.

14:10.120 --> 14:14.192
That made Bobby the hot lawyer
in town for gettin' people off.

14:14.258 --> 14:16.227
It all started with
the Braun trial.

14:16.295 --> 14:18.998
So?
So it was my strategy.

14:19.064 --> 14:21.467
I had the idea for
jury nullification--

14:21.534 --> 14:23.870
Same strategy he's usin'
on this doctor trial.

14:23.937 --> 14:27.675
So?
So I shouldn't be treated like
I'm some second-class lawyer.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.614
You came here after
getting fired from a bank
for falsifying loan documents.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.384
For this office.
To help people here.

14:34.451 --> 14:37.087
Last week you were arrested
for picking up a hooker.

14:37.154 --> 14:38.990
For which I was cleared.
I was innocent.

14:39.057 --> 14:41.393
Yeah. Details.

14:41.460 --> 14:44.096
Jimmy, this is Boston.

14:44.163 --> 14:47.768
Half of what you are as
a lawyer is what the judge
and other lawyers think of you.

14:47.835 --> 14:50.772
Jimmy, right now
they think you're a hack.

14:52.274 --> 14:56.546
Bobby knows you're
a good lawyer.

14:56.612 --> 14:59.249
You have to lay low
a little longer.

15:00.852 --> 15:02.754
[ Sighs ]

15:04.056 --> 15:07.059
I'd run some numbers--
small-time.

15:07.126 --> 15:10.129
Football, boxing--
I usually do good.

15:10.196 --> 15:12.733
Mr. Malzone,
let's cut to it.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.570
Do you work for a larger
gaming organization?

15:15.636 --> 15:19.575
Not really.
I-I-I'm kind of retired.

15:19.642 --> 15:22.780
They allow me to work
to pick up some money.

15:22.846 --> 15:25.449
Most of my clients
are longtime friends.

15:25.516 --> 15:29.188
So, who are the people
you work for?

15:29.254 --> 15:33.093
I can't tell you that.
Why not, sir?

15:33.159 --> 15:35.996
Because there's
a code of loyalty.

15:36.063 --> 15:38.400
These people have
been loyal to me.

15:38.466 --> 15:40.435
I stay loyal to them.

15:40.502 --> 15:43.038
[ Stammers ]
We're family.

15:43.106 --> 15:47.077
And that's why you won't
reveal their identity,
because of loyalty?

15:47.144 --> 15:49.246
That, and they'd kill me.

15:49.313 --> 15:52.484
[ Laughs, Clears Throat ]

15:55.154 --> 15:57.257
[ Lindsay ]
He's so cute.
Why can't you kick him?

15:57.324 --> 16:00.661
Oh, 'cause it sends the wrong
message to all the other
cute bookies out there.

16:00.728 --> 16:03.264
You bet on football, Chris.
Come on.

16:03.331 --> 16:05.434
[ Sighs ]

16:05.500 --> 16:07.670
Okay. Tell you what.

16:07.737 --> 16:11.041
This is unorthodox, but if
you're willing to go for it--

16:11.107 --> 16:14.245
What?
One kiss.

16:14.311 --> 16:16.648
Excuse me?
Yeah, for old times' sake.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.685
One kiss-- a good kiss--
the case melts away.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.956
[ Laughs ]

16:23.023 --> 16:25.259
Grow up.
I'm serious.

16:25.326 --> 16:27.462
Lips and deal have
to stay sealed though.

16:29.598 --> 16:33.870
You're serious?
You'd actually kick this
if I kissed you?

16:36.006 --> 16:38.677
No. I'm not serious.

16:38.743 --> 16:42.948
But you considered it. I saw
it in your eyes. So why don't
you just kiss me for free,

16:43.015 --> 16:45.651
and then you don't have to think
of yourself as for sale?

16:45.719 --> 16:47.988
You just think you're too cool,
don't you?

16:48.055 --> 16:51.293
[ Laughs ]
I can't drop the case.
I've got marching orders.

16:51.359 --> 16:54.129
What is up with your office?
You're going after
a small-time numbers guy,

16:54.196 --> 16:57.066
prosecuting a doctor for
turning up a morphine drip.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.003
That's Gamble, not the office.

16:59.069 --> 17:02.039
In fact, they suggested
she pull back on that,
and she refused.

17:02.107 --> 17:05.076
- Really? Why?
- You know her better than I do.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.951
Blow!
<i>It is my birthday.</i>

17:11.018 --> 17:13.421
[ All ]
Blow!

17:13.487 --> 17:16.992
Oh!
[ Ellenor ]
That was four years ago?

17:17.059 --> 17:19.395
Yes, her 45th.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.539
Happy birthday.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.943
I love you.

17:32.178 --> 17:34.781
[ Woman ]
That was about a week
before she died.

17:34.848 --> 17:39.454
[ Ellenor ] Julie, can you tell
us a little bit about the day
your mother passed away?

17:39.520 --> 17:42.224
Well, she knew it was
probably one of her last.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.561
She wasn't completely alert.

17:44.627 --> 17:48.266
<i>But she could recognize</i>
<i>all of us.</i>

17:48.332 --> 17:50.501
Can you talk about
the last few hours?

17:50.568 --> 17:56.109
Well, we had put up pictures--

17:56.176 --> 17:59.646
large blown-up photographs
all around the room.

17:59.713 --> 18:03.551
Pictures of when we were
little and so forth.

18:04.519 --> 18:07.523
The, uh--

18:07.590 --> 18:11.595
The doctor came in around noon,
and we all had to, uh--

18:13.831 --> 18:17.269
He wanted to make sure
that we were all sure.

18:17.336 --> 18:20.239
[ Ellenor ]
We can take a break
anytime you want.

18:20.306 --> 18:23.043
No, I'm okay.

18:24.578 --> 18:28.550
After he turned up the morphine,

18:28.617 --> 18:31.687
we knew she had about
an hour left of consciousness.

18:33.523 --> 18:35.792
We all held hands.

18:37.394 --> 18:39.497
My sister and I sang.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.903
She used to love it when we--

18:47.674 --> 18:52.614
We all held hands. We told her
how much we loved her.

18:52.681 --> 18:55.918
She told us how much
she loved us.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.891
And then she faded off
into sleep.

19:02.560 --> 19:08.301
Julie, the prosecution
is trying to convict
Dr. Richards of murder.

19:08.368 --> 19:10.871
Yeah, which to me is sick.

19:10.937 --> 19:14.876
<i>My mother had a good death.</i>
<i>It was peaceful.</i>

19:14.942 --> 19:17.379
I mean, she could've gone out
with pain and bedsores,

19:17.446 --> 19:20.449
and instead she died
without hurt.

19:20.516 --> 19:23.854
She died with her family there
loving her.

19:23.921 --> 19:28.694
And with her knowing that,
it was a good death.

19:30.696 --> 19:35.603
And I am so grateful,
and so was my mother.

19:43.212 --> 19:45.882
We put Dr. Richards up.
That should be it.
Where are we on Malzone?

19:45.949 --> 19:48.285
Dead in the water.
They got it on tape.
Carl won't plead.

19:48.352 --> 19:50.422
Well, you better make him plead.

19:50.488 --> 19:52.891
Jimmy, everything okay?

19:52.958 --> 19:56.996
Sure. I'm just sitting here
doing nothing. It's my niche.

19:58.933 --> 20:01.436
- Well, maybe we could
talk about it later.
- Oh, sure.

20:01.502 --> 20:03.972
I can pencil "later"
into my schedule.

20:04.039 --> 20:06.542
Okay, Ellie, let's go.
Make him take the plea.

20:09.779 --> 20:13.017
The term we use for it
is "managed death."

20:13.084 --> 20:15.954
- Does that mean
you cause the death?
- No.

20:16.020 --> 20:18.724
It means that faced with
an inevitable death,

20:18.791 --> 20:21.394
managing it
to relieve suffering.

20:21.461 --> 20:24.732
And in the case of Jane Crewson,
that meant turning up
the morphine drip?

20:24.799 --> 20:26.801
Yes.
To a potentially
lethal dosage?

20:26.868 --> 20:28.671
Yes.

20:28.737 --> 20:31.607
- And the patient consented?
- That's correct.

20:31.674 --> 20:33.610
<i>As did her family?</i>
Yes.

20:33.677 --> 20:38.183
- <i>Did you clear this decision</i>
with the hospital authorities?
- <i>No, I did not.</i>

20:38.249 --> 20:43.122
Really? Isn't this kind of
a big thing, hastening
a patient's death?

20:43.189 --> 20:46.660
Of course it is.
It is also a privacy issue.

20:46.727 --> 20:50.298
Even so, you'd think
the hospital might have
something to say on this.

20:50.364 --> 20:54.336
Well, I hate to be blunt
to the point of sounding cold,

20:54.403 --> 20:58.041
but if hospitals took time out
to review every decision
that was made...

20:58.108 --> 21:01.278
to let a patient die,
the system would choke.

21:01.345 --> 21:04.917
[ Ellenor ]
So you mean this goes on a lot?

21:04.983 --> 21:07.286
Seventy percent of all deaths
in hospitals...

21:07.353 --> 21:10.157
are due to decisions
to let the patient die.

21:10.224 --> 21:13.361
[ Ellenor ] Seventy percent?
Most deaths aren't
that dramatic.

21:13.428 --> 21:18.667
It's doctor and patient
and family deciding it's time.

21:18.735 --> 21:23.040
And in your medical opinion,
sir, it was time
for Jane Crewson?

21:23.106 --> 21:25.643
No. The medical opinion
was that all we could do...

21:25.709 --> 21:30.483
was prolong her life
with various treatments--
prolong her suffering.

21:30.550 --> 21:36.157
<i>Her personal decision,</i>
<i>supported by her family,</i>
<i>was that it was time.</i>

21:36.223 --> 21:39.026
<i>Now, given the law against</i>
<i>euthanasia, Doctor,</i>

21:39.094 --> 21:41.129
weren't you tempted
to deny their request?

21:41.196 --> 21:44.534
Again, the morphine drip was
not meant to euthanize her.

21:44.601 --> 21:46.403
It was meant to relieve pain.

21:46.470 --> 21:49.407
But you did know that--
The likely result, yes.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.378
But legally, I believe
I stayed within bounds.

21:52.444 --> 21:57.985
And morally, when a terminal
patient in severe pain...

21:58.051 --> 22:03.024
asks that she be allowed to die
with a modicum of decency,

22:03.091 --> 22:05.027
I listen.

22:05.094 --> 22:08.064
And I listened to Jane Crewson.

22:08.131 --> 22:10.801
Thank you.

22:18.877 --> 22:21.381
I got it down to a year.
That's pretty good, Carl.

22:21.448 --> 22:23.617
A year in jail,
at my age?

22:23.684 --> 22:25.486
That could be
a death sentence.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.424
- It won't be a death sentence.
- What will I do?

22:28.490 --> 22:30.659
Mrs. Malzone,
we have to consider
the lesser of two evils.

22:30.727 --> 22:33.263
What do you think, Eugene?

22:33.330 --> 22:36.200
Well, it's tough.
If you lose, you're looking
at three to four.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.737
This isn't even a close call.
They had you on videotape.

22:38.803 --> 22:40.672
It's your third time.
The jury knows that.

22:40.739 --> 22:42.842
Take the plea.

22:45.812 --> 22:48.282
I wanna hear you say it.

22:52.154 --> 22:54.323
- Let's roll the dice.
- Eugene.

22:54.390 --> 22:57.260
Could I speak to you
in private a second?
Excuse us.

23:00.498 --> 23:02.167
Hey!
Are you nuts?

23:02.233 --> 23:04.536
I think we got a shot.
With "United States
of America"?

23:04.603 --> 23:06.405
How?
It was your idea.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.775
Yes, because we're so desperate,
it's malpractice
not to take the plea.

23:08.841 --> 23:10.510
I think I can win it.
You can't.

23:10.578 --> 23:12.346
I can.
You know what?

23:12.413 --> 23:14.916
This is-- This--
You're all goosed
over the challenge.

23:14.983 --> 23:17.152
Th-This is fun for you.
You're not thinking of him.

23:17.219 --> 23:19.990
This about how deep a hole
you think you can jump out of.
Hey.

23:20.056 --> 23:22.292
No, you "hey."
No, you "hey."
You brought me in.

23:22.359 --> 23:26.798
You asked me to try it.
I think I can win it.
In fact, I know I can.

23:28.033 --> 23:31.504
Funny. I had planned to
cross-examine you with,

23:31.570 --> 23:35.976
"Hey, if we let you do it,
what's to stop all the other
doctors from doing it?"

23:36.043 --> 23:39.948
But you said
they're already doing it.

23:40.015 --> 23:43.185
Seventy percent of
all hospital deaths.

23:43.252 --> 23:47.358
That's not my statistic. It

If the defendant correctly
points out that the leading
cause of death...

24:59.783 --> 25:05.424
Aside from the fact that
your hostility is borderline

Tough to convince

You saw the defendant engage

Better be good.

25:52.851 --> 25:57.424
Most criminal trials,
the key testimony
comes from the victim.

25:57.491 --> 26:00.595
Uh, but they didn't put
a victim on the stand here,
did they?

26:00.661 --> 26:03.832
Because there is no victim.

"It's against public policy."

"Gambling is against
who and what we are."

26:16.181 --> 26:18.884

"He went for it."
"He defied the odds."
"He rolled the dice."

These are terms we use

This is America,
and gambling is in our blood.

26:53.495 --> 26:57.033
Now, what bothers me most
about this trial,

26:57.100 --> 26:58.969
is the blatant hypocrisy
of it all.

26:59.036 --> 27:02.740
'Cause we don't just tolerate

We breed them.

They use the lottery to raise

Now they're only going

because they're trying to
extort him to fork over
somebody bigger.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.666
And the gaming charge is
the only card they have to play.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.205
It stinks.

This man is a grandfather...

This is a forum for justice.

28:17.570 --> 28:20.674
It is not a prosecutorial tool
to extort people.

And if you let them
do this here,

28:23.077 --> 28:27.883
if you let them use
our justice system as a weapon
to oppress, then what's next?

28:27.949 --> 28:30.452

That's not what
a courtroom is for,

How many patients would you say

28:47.708 --> 28:50.512
On average?
Well, maybe a hundred.

28:50.578 --> 28:54.717
A hundred. And did you know
Jane Crewson more or less
than the other hundred?

28:54.784 --> 28:58.222
Maybe a little more,
but my relationship with her
was fairly typical.

- You weren't
her primary physician?
- No. I'm an oncologist.

I have to admit, counsel,

I'm trying to get a sense
of how well the doctor
knew his patient.

29:11.605 --> 29:16.145
He made a judgment that
Jane Crewson was competent to
make a pretty big decision here.

29:16.211 --> 29:20.984
Legally, the decision was made
by Mr. Crewson, since legally
he was the appointed guardian.

31:00.544 --> 31:02.246
I didn't have to.
You didn't?

[ Sighs ]

33:48.226 --> 33:50.796
I knew a woman who
was dying of cancer.

33:52.164 --> 33:56.236
And when this cancer
seeped into her brain,

33:56.303 --> 33:58.806
she couldn't even
recognize her husband,

34:08.585 --> 34:10.855
The doctor--

34:13.391 --> 34:17.263
It was agreed
that the respirator
would be turned off--

34:17.330 --> 34:19.331
should be turned off.

34:20.867 --> 34:23.670
And he wouldn't do it.

34:23.737 --> 34:26.274
It fell to the husband.

34:26.341 --> 34:29.078
And the husband--

34:29.145 --> 34:34.851
You see, he-- he just couldn't
bring himself to do it.

34:34.918 --> 34:38.690
So he asked his son.

34:38.757 --> 34:40.926
And the son,

34:40.993 --> 34:45.098
to spare both
his dad and his mom,

34:45.165 --> 34:49.904

their suffering.

And his-his-his hand
started to--
started to shake...

34:54.510 --> 34:58.548
to the point where he--
he couldn't even feel that
it was connected to his arm.

34:58.616 --> 35:01.152
And he remembers thinking...

35:03.789 --> 35:05.958
God has his hand now.

35:09.930 --> 35:14.969
The hand, it finally did
turn off the respirator.

you just heard...

36:47.955 --> 36:51.360
was wholly, totally
objectionable.

36:51.427 --> 36:55.532
The reason I didn't object
is because I agree with
the defense counsel...

that this trial is not
just about Dr. Richards--

37:00.605 --> 37:02.941

37:08.849 --> 37:13.855
Sarah Washington Gamble,
my grandmother.

37:13.922 --> 37:19.529
Cause of death:
Respiration failure brought on
by the morphine drip.

37:19.596 --> 37:21.598
She had Alzheimer's,

37:21.665 --> 37:26.538
and she was suffering from
both pain and dementia.

37:26.605 --> 37:31.778
And according to her,
the doctors and most
of her family,

37:31.844 --> 37:34.315
she wanted to die.

37:35.683 --> 37:37.952
But she didn't.

37:38.019 --> 37:42.658
See, I was the granddaughter
that spent every summer
with her,

37:42.725 --> 37:45.462
the one who lived with her
when I was in law school.

37:45.529 --> 37:48.900
<i>And though she said</i>
<i>she wanted to die,</i>

37:48.966 --> 37:52.505
<i>what she really felt</i>
<i>was it was her duty.</i>

37:52.571 --> 37:56.743
She didn't wanna be a burden
on her family anymore.

37:56.810 --> 37:59.680
Sure as she said
she wanted death,

38:00.849 --> 38:03.919
as sure as I stand
before you now,

38:04.854 --> 38:06.989
she still wanted to live.

38:07.056 --> 38:09.226
I know it.

38:09.292 --> 38:13.665
<i>See, the problem with</i>
<i>going down this slope...</i>

38:13.732 --> 38:17.737
is you make suicide permissible,
then acceptable,

38:17.803 --> 38:22.844
then possibly
in some people's minds
the right thing to do.

38:22.910 --> 38:25.881
You plant the idea
with the elderly.

38:25.948 --> 38:28.884
It's selfish to hang on,
to cling to life,

38:28.951 --> 38:31.287
exhausting financial resources,

38:31.355 --> 38:34.124
having to make the children
look at a sick person,

38:34.191 --> 38:36.327
having to empty a bedpan.

38:36.394 --> 38:40.132
It's selfish to impose that
on someone you love.

38:42.201 --> 38:44.604
I'm sure someday...

38:44.672 --> 38:50.179
I'll meet someone I love
as much as I loved
my grandmother.

38:51.113 --> 38:53.583
But for now,

38:53.649 --> 38:57.053
I wish I could be
emptying her bedpans.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.224
She didn't have long
in the end. I know.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.497
But she had another day,

39:04.563 --> 39:07.634
and probably another day
after that one...

39:07.701 --> 39:10.505
and after that one.

39:12.440 --> 39:16.012
The doctor, he had no way
of really knowing her.

39:16.078 --> 39:19.749
He had possibly
a hundred patients.

39:20.884 --> 39:22.720
He was a very kind man.

39:22.786 --> 39:27.893
But his act of kindness,
it wasn't a blessing.

39:27.960 --> 39:32.098
It hastened the death
of a person I know
wanted to cling...

39:32.165 --> 39:34.401
just a little longer.

39:36.270 --> 39:39.374
This trial is going
to send a message.

39:41.510 --> 39:44.648
I hope the message you send...

39:46.216 --> 39:48.653
is there is a sanctity to life.

39:50.121 --> 39:54.394
Let's not send the message
that suicide,

39:55.328 --> 39:58.699
or assisted suicide,
is noble.

40:01.302 --> 40:04.607
That message may
cost you dearly.

40:06.242 --> 40:09.313
You can trust me on that.

40:20.594 --> 40:23.298
Will the defendant
please rise.

40:25.533 --> 40:27.937
The jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

40:28.004 --> 40:30.106
We have,
Your Honor.
Let's have it.

40:30.172 --> 40:33.644
[ Woman ] In the matter
of theCommonwealth

40:33.711 --> 40:39.084
on the charge of gaming
prohibited under Chapter 269,
Section 14,

40:39.151 --> 40:42.122

not guilty.

The jury is dismissed with
the thanks of the court.

40:48.162 --> 40:49.998
[ Gavel Raps ]
Thank you very much.

40:50.065 --> 40:52.201
You're welcome.

40:54.003 --> 40:56.606
You owe me.
I owe you.

40:56.673 --> 41:00.011
I'd like to thank you too
as an American citizen.

41:00.078 --> 41:04.316
- Hey, no problem.
- And just to show you
I'm a good sport.

41:06.819 --> 41:10.258
You're lucky
you didn't touch lip.
I would've brought you up.

41:13.227 --> 41:16.666
Your Honor.
Counsel.
Going down?

41:16.732 --> 41:18.701
Well, you tell me.

41:20.371 --> 41:22.439
Can I ask a question,
at the risk of ex parte?

41:22.506 --> 41:24.442
Sure.

41:24.509 --> 41:27.646
Worst case scenario,
I jail you.
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]

41:29.148 --> 41:32.519
You know, you let a lot in
that had nothing to do
with this case.

41:32.586 --> 41:36.091
That depends on
what you thought
this case was about.

41:36.157 --> 41:40.596
It was supposed to be about
whether or not a defendant
committed a crime, nothing more.

41:40.662 --> 41:44.534
Yeah, well, you really think
I should leave...

41:44.602 --> 41:47.271
legislative policy up to
the legislature?

41:49.073 --> 41:53.513
The book on you is that
you study up a little on
your lawyers before they appear.

41:53.579 --> 41:56.650
Yeah. Book got pictures?

41:58.720 --> 42:02.825
You knew, didn't you?
Bobby's mother?
Gamble's grandmother?

42:02.891 --> 42:07.063
- You knew.

an exciting trial.

[ Elevator Bell Dings ]
But I certainly never knew
we'd have a verdict today.

42:36.033 --> 42:38.336
Is this good?

42:38.403 --> 42:40.839
I don't know.

42:40.907 --> 42:44.244
Have you reached
a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.380
Will the defendant please rise.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.686

[ Spectators Chattering ]
I don't believe it.

43:06.172 --> 43:09.076
- I don't believe it.
- We got a lot of grounds.
Quick deliberation is one.

43:09.143 --> 43:12.747
[ Judge Pratt ] The jury's work
is completed. You're done.
You can go. We thank you.

43:24.510 --> 43:26.543
[ Woman ]
Doctor, will you
make a statement?

43:28.210 --> 43:31.743
Ten hours community service.
No time.

43:37.610 --> 43:39.776
She just told me no jail.

43:39.843 --> 43:42.543
No jail.

43:47.910 --> 43:51.543
Finally, a victory against
jury nullification.
Way to go, Helen.

43:51.610 --> 43:53.776
Thanks.
Good win, Helen.
Great job.

43:53.843 --> 43:57.076
Oh, yeah.
Get out of here.
