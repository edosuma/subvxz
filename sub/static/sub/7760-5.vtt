- HE ALREADY DID.
- SHUT UP! YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:20.273 --> 12:22.142
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY
IN PITTSBURGH

12:22.175 --> 12:24.411
NEEDS TO KNOW MY BUSINESS
AND FEEL FREE TO COMMENT ON IT.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.247
I'M GOING HOME TO WHACK OFF,
AND THAT'S THE LAST

12:27.280 --> 12:29.883
ANYBODY NEEDS TO HEAR ABOUT IT!

12:33.921 --> 12:38.125
- ANYBODY KNOW WHERE HE LIVES?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.927
- OUR FIRM REPRESENTS

12:39.960 --> 12:41.328
SOME OF THE HOTTEST
YOUNG CONCERT ARTISTS

12:41.361 --> 12:42.529
PERFORMING IN THE BUSINESS,

12:42.562 --> 12:44.264
SINGERS, DANCERS, MUSICIANS.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.899
- SO YOU'RE WHAT, AN AGENT?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.134
- TALENT REPRESENTATIVE.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.535
WE ARRANGE FOR BOOKINGS,

12:48.568 --> 12:50.270
RECORDING CONTRACTS,

12:50.303 --> 12:52.472
TOURS,
BOTH IN THE STATES AND ABROAD.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.874
- TOURS?

12:53.907 --> 12:55.542
- ONCE PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

12:55.575 --> 12:57.544
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT
TO SEE YOU AND HEAR YOU PERFORM.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.279
- HOW ARE THEY GOING
TO KNOW THAT?

12:59.312 --> 13:01.314
- WELL, LEAVE THAT UP TO US.
THAT'S OUR JOB.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.283
- SO ARE YOU--

13:03.316 --> 13:05.285
ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT
TO REPRESENT ME?

13:05.318 --> 13:09.189
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.160
- BUT WHY? WHY ME?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.295
I DIDN'T EVEN WIN.
I WASN'T EVEN THE BEST.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.497
- HAVE YOU BEEN IN A RECORD
STORE LATELY, ETHAN?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.899
IN THE CLASSICAL DEPARTMENT?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.433
- WELL, YEAH, I MAKE MY OWN CDs.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.601
I LIKE TO CHECK OUT
THE COMPETITION,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.570
SEE WHAT JOSHUA BELL IS UP TO.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.205
- OKAY, SO YOU'VE NOTICED
IT'S STARTING TO LOOK

13:25.238 --> 13:27.174
A LOT
LIKE THE ROCK DEPARTMENT.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.177
THERE'S NO MORE COVERS
WITH SNOWY-HAIRED GRANDFATHERS

13:30.210 --> 13:32.212
PROPPED UP LIKE CORPSES
AT THEIR BABY GRANDS

13:32.245 --> 13:34.181
OR CLUTCHING THEIR VIOLINS.

13:34.214 --> 13:38.251
ARTISTS THESE DAYS
ARE YOUNG, HIP, SEXY.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.588
MUCH LIKE YOURSELF.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.323
- SO IS THAT WHY YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN HIM?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.859
BECAUSE HE'S CUTE?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.594
- I'M INTERESTED IN HIM

13:47.627 --> 13:49.529
BECAUSE HE'S
AN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.064
ALL THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY

13:51.098 --> 13:52.599
BECAUSE HE'S A TALENT
I CAN SELL.

13:52.632 --> 13:56.336
- SO I'M A--
SO I'M A COMMODITY?

13:56.369 --> 13:59.973
- I CAN'T VERY WELL SELL MOZART.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.110
UNLIKE EMINEM, HE HASN'T WRITTEN
ANYTHING NEW IN 300 YEARS.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.978
- [chuckles]

14:05.012 --> 14:06.546
- CAN YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.381
HAVE TO PEE.

14:08.415 --> 14:12.352
- HE'S A NICE KID.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.421
- HE'S AN AMAZING ARTIST.
- REALLY?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.956
HE'S GOOD-LOOKING TOO.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.559
- DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.996
- I LIKED MEETING HIM,

14:23.030 --> 14:24.497
BUT, IF YOU DECIDE
TO SIGN WITH ME,

14:24.531 --> 14:26.633
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.402
- WHAT?

14:29.436 --> 14:31.972
- AS FAR AS YOUR PROFESSIONAL
CAREER IS CONCERNED,

14:32.005 --> 14:34.307
HE DOESN'T EXIST.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.015
[indistinct chatter]

14:48.155 --> 14:49.522
- JUST AS I EXPECTED,

14:49.556 --> 14:54.027
PLENTY OF PRICEY PREY SWIMMING
IN THESE WATERS.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.395
PERISCOPE DEPTH.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.397
FOCUS.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.032
THAT'S BILL RANSON OVER THERE.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.168
JERUSALEM STEEL.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.404
THE REDHEAD BESIDE HIM
IS THE GATEKEEPER.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.406
GET BY HER, YOU'RE IN.

15:06.439 --> 15:10.143
DIANE OVERTON.
BLACK DRESS, BY THE BAR.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.146
- CHECK.
- CARNEGIE FOUNDATION.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.317
LOTS OF GOOD LEADS THROUGH HER.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.456
AH, THE MAN OF THE HOUR
WHOM EVERYONE'S...

15:23.490 --> 15:25.292
- HI.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.294
- ANTED UP FIVE THOU
TO SHAKE HANDS WITH,

15:27.327 --> 15:28.695
JIM STOCKWELL.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.998
- HOW ARE YOU?
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.701
ARE YOU LISTENING?

15:34.734 --> 15:38.638
I PAID A SHITLOAD OF CASH
TO GET US IN HERE.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.340
- FOR WHICH I AM ETERNALLY
GRATEFUL.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.608
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

15:41.641 --> 15:44.411
- TO FIRE A TORPEDO, CAP'N.

16:16.776 --> 16:21.481
SO YOU'RE RUNNING FOR MAYOR?

16:21.514 --> 16:22.749
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.251
- HOW'S IT GOING?

16:24.284 --> 16:26.419
- VERY WELL, THANKS.
- REALLY?

16:26.453 --> 16:29.622
BECAUSE WITH ALL THIS MONEY
YOU'RE RAISING,

16:29.656 --> 16:31.224
YOU SHOULD BE OUT IN FRONT,
BUT THE POLLS

16:31.258 --> 16:33.760
SHOW YOU TRAILING
COUNCILMAN DEEKINS.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.362
- MY OPPONENT IS AHEAD
AT THIS POINT

16:35.395 --> 16:37.297
BY THE NARROWEST OF MARGINS.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.300
HOWEVER, MY ADVISORS
HAVE INFORMED ME

16:40.333 --> 16:43.570
THAT WE'RE WELL POSITIONED
TO TAKE OVER THE LEAD.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.773
- YOUR ADVISORS ARE BLOWING
SMOKE UP YOUR ASS.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.375
AND YOUR PREPARED REMARKS

16:48.408 --> 16:50.277
ARE AS STALE AS THE CAMPAIGN
YOU'RE RUNNING.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.679
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPINION,
MR...

16:52.712 --> 16:55.115
- KINNEY.
BRIAN KINNEY.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.783
- IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL HEARING
FROM ONE'S SUPPORTERS.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.685
- I'M NOT A SUPPORTER.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.420
I'M AN ADMAN, TRYING TO DRUM UP
SOME BUSINESS

17:00.453 --> 17:02.589
AMONG YOUR RICH
AND POWERFUL FRIENDS.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.659
- HUH.
AT LEAST YOU'RE HONEST.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.396
- AND I FIGURE THE BEST WAY
TO GET IN WITH THEM

17:09.429 --> 17:12.565
IS TO GET IN WITH YOU,
SO, IF YOU EVER GET TIRED

17:12.599 --> 17:14.201
OF PISSING AWAY
YOUR PALS' MILLIONS

17:14.234 --> 17:15.668
ON AN AD CAMPAIGN
THAT HAS YOU POSITIONED

17:15.702 --> 17:19.272
EXACTLY WHERE YOUR ADVISORS
WANT YOU TO BE,

17:19.306 --> 17:22.075
GIVE ME A CALL.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.612
- WHAT TIME IS IT?

17:25.645 --> 17:28.148
- OH, 5:30.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.416
- IT'S SO EARLY.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.084
- YEAH, CLASS IS AT 8:00.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.752
- COME BACK HERE.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.421
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

17:34.454 --> 17:38.225
- AH...
HO-HO.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.327
- I THOUGHT WE COULD--

17:40.360 --> 17:42.162
- YEAH, I WANT TO HIT THE GYM
BEFORE CLASS.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.630
- THERE'S TIME.
- I WAS HOPING

17:43.663 --> 17:46.233
YOU COULD HELP MAKE
A LITTLE CUP OF LOVE.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.735
- MAYBE LATER.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.570
OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE SO HOT.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.572
IT WON'T TAKE ME VERY LONG.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.307
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I GET IT

17:54.341 --> 17:55.475
TO MEL AND LINDS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.843
- WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME

17:56.876 --> 17:58.445
THAT I GET TO THE GYM
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.281
'KAY, I HAVE TO GO.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.750
NOW.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.625
- YOU HARDLY SAID A WORD
THE ENTIRE FLIGHT...

18:12.659 --> 18:14.194
OR LAST NIGHT EVEN.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.728
IF IT WAS ME,

18:15.762 --> 18:18.131
I WOULD BE RUNNING AROUND,
TELLING EVERYONE,

18:18.165 --> 18:19.332
"MY BOYFRIEND'S GOING
TO BE A STAR!"

18:19.366 --> 18:21.234
- GREAT.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.136
- HEY, CAN WE GO TO THE DINER?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.871
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW OFF,
YOU GOTTA LET ME DO IT FOR YOU.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.240
- WAIT.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.542
- WHAT'S WRONG?

18:29.576 --> 18:33.213
- GLEN SAID, IF I SIGN WITH HIM,
I HAVE TO BE STRAIGHT.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.416
- STRAIGHT?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.619
- I CAN'T BE OUT.
NOBODY CAN KNOW I'M GAY.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.521
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.690
- HE SAID IT WAS A CONDITION
OF THE CONTRACT

18:43.723 --> 18:45.625
THAT I COULDN'T BE SEEN
WITH YOU IN PUBLIC

18:45.658 --> 18:47.494
OR ACKNOWLEDGE YOU.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.363
- WHA...
THAT'S TOTALLY FUCKED.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.499
IT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS,
SO WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO

18:52.532 --> 18:54.767
WITH PLAYING THE VIOLIN?
- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.503
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ALBUM COVER,

18:56.536 --> 18:58.805
HAVING SOME YOUNG HOT STUD
WITH TOUSLED HAIR,

18:58.838 --> 19:00.307
SHIRT UNBUTTONED DOWN TO HERE,

19:00.340 --> 19:01.574
STROKING HIS VIOLIN.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.176
- BUT YOU'RE A SERIOUS ARTIST.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.411
- YEAH, WELL, IF THAT'S
ALL HE CARED ABOUT,

19:04.444 --> 19:06.713
HE'D BE TALKING TO LING LIU.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.948
YOU KNOW, ALL GLEN
AND THE RECORD COMPANIES

19:08.981 --> 19:10.917
CARE ABOUT IS PURSE POWER.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.254
ALL THOSE YOUNG WOMEN WHO SPEND
BILLIONS A YEAR ON CDs,

19:14.287 --> 19:16.723
WHO PROBABLY THINK PAGANINI IS
A BRAND OF FROZEN PIZZA,

19:16.756 --> 19:19.259
WHO MIGHT NOT BUY
ETHAN GOLD'S LATEST CD

19:19.292 --> 19:20.927
IF THEY KNEW HE WAS--

19:20.960 --> 19:23.095
FUCK.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.835
- WELL, WHERE DOES THIS
LEAVE US?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.305
- TOGETHER.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.574
'CAUSE I'M NOT SIGNING.

19:37.644 --> 19:40.313
- ARE YOU SURE?

19:40.347 --> 19:42.949
IT'S YOUR BIG BREAK.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.551
- IT'S ALSO MY TALENT,

19:44.584 --> 19:46.819
MY HARD WORK...

19:46.853 --> 19:50.223
MY LIFE, MY DECISION...

19:50.257 --> 19:52.459
AND MY BOYFRIEND.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.866
- BRIAN, YOU WON'T BELIEVE--
- ANY CALLS?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.501
- NO, BUT YOU'LL...

20:01.534 --> 20:03.236
- WELL, DID BROWN'S SEND
THEIR PROOFS BACK YET?

20:03.270 --> 20:04.704
- THEY CAME YESTERDAY,
BUT THE HELL WITH BROWN'S.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.905
IT-IT WON'T MATTER
WHEN I TELL YOU WHO'S--

20:05.938 --> 20:07.307
- CHIEF STOCKWELL.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.841
- GOOD MORNING,
MR. KINNEY.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.510
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
MY DROPPING BY UNANNOUNCED.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.345
- ACTUALLY,
I WAS EXPECTING YOU.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.981
- I WANTED MY ADVISORS, NANCY
HENDERSON AND DOMINIC SCOLOTTO,

20:15.014 --> 20:17.450
TO MEET YOU, AND TO HEAR
FIRSTHAND WHAT YOU TOLD ME

20:17.484 --> 20:18.718
IN THE MEN'S ROOM
THE OTHER NIGHT.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.621
- WHAT,
TO MAKE SURE YOU FLUSH?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.922
OR THAT YOU'RE
PISSING AWAY THE MONEY

20:22.955 --> 20:24.891
YOU'VE SPENT
ON YOUR AD CAMPAIGN?

20:24.924 --> 20:27.594
WHICH AMOUNTS
TO THE SAME THING.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.329
- MR. KINNEY,
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK,

20:29.362 --> 20:31.030
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RUNNING
A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.633
- NOT A GODDAMN THING.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.335
- THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING HERE?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.936
- BECAUSE WHAT KINNEY SAID
IS TRUE,

20:36.969 --> 20:38.871
AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO'S HAD
THE BALLS TO SAY IT.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.273
PLEASE CONTINUE.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.508
- WELL, LIKE I WAS SAYING,

20:41.541 --> 20:43.042
I MAY NOT KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT POLITICS,

20:43.075 --> 20:45.011
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT SELLS.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.380
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU'VE GOT
A PRODUCT THAT NO ONE'S BUYING.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.881
- YOU MAKE HIM SOUND LIKE
A BOX OF CORN FLAKES.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.650
- WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE IS.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.019
LUCKY FOR YOU, SELLING CORN
FLAKES IS WHAT I DO BEST.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.787
- MR. KINNEY...

20:54.821 --> 20:57.357
JIM STOCKWELL HAS A 15-YEAR
RECORD OF FIGHTING CRIME.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.660
AS CHIEF OF POLICE, HE'S
DEFENDED NOT ONLY OUR STREETS,

21:00.693 --> 21:02.395
BUT OUR TRADITIONS,
OUR MORAL VALUES.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.564
HIS MANDATE TO SERVE IS BASED
UPON THAT COMMITMENT.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.634
- WOULD YOU MIND SPARING ME
THE BULLSHIT RHETORIC?

21:07.667 --> 21:10.503
WE ALL KNOW
YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY,

21:10.537 --> 21:12.372
YOUR FLAG, YOUR MOTHER,

21:12.405 --> 21:13.773
BUT IT'S NOT GOING
TO GET YOU ARRESTED.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.575
OR IN THIS CASE, ELECTED.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.410
- WHAT WILL?

21:17.444 --> 21:19.812
- SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE THE
CONSUMER WANT TO BUY YOUR BRAND

21:19.846 --> 21:21.648
RATHER THAN THE COMPETITION.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.949
SOMETHING THAT WILL ATTRACT
THEIR ATTENTION

21:22.982 --> 21:25.652
FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.687
SOMETHING THAT WILL
MAKE YOU POP.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.393
- * FOUND A LITTLE PLACE
IN THE COUNTRY *

21:33.426 --> 21:35.995
* WE CAN REST OUR FEET

21:36.028 --> 21:40.600
* GOT A LITTLE PLACE THAT WE CAN
CALL OUR SUNNYSIDE RETREAT *

21:40.633 --> 21:42.702
* CAN YOU PICTURE US
LIVING IT UP *

21:42.735 --> 21:44.704
- THIS ONE'S A STEAL.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.806
BRAND-NEW,
NEVER BEEN OCCUPIED.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.875
THE BUILDER WENT BANKRUPT,
SO...

21:48.908 --> 21:51.478
I'M SURE YOU COULD GET IT
FOR A SONG.

21:51.511 --> 21:55.682
- WELL, I'M ENJOYING
THE MUSIC.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.417
I SAY WE GO FOR IT.
HOW ABOUT YOU, EM?

21:57.450 --> 21:58.818
DON'T YOU LOVE IT?

21:58.851 --> 22:01.888
- WELL, LOVE'S A...
VERY STRONG WORD.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.490
- WELL, WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.992
- WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
MY DREAM HOUSE.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.960
- OF COURSE, UH,
YOU HAVE TO PICTURE IT

22:07.994 --> 22:09.596
WITH YOUR POSSESSIONS,

22:09.629 --> 22:11.598
YOUR FURNITURE,
PRINTS ON THE WALL.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.132
- RIGHT, USE A LITTLE
IMAGINATION.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.468
- OH, I-I AM.
[laughs]

22:15.502 --> 22:16.703
AND, UM...

22:16.736 --> 22:18.871
AND WITH A LITTLE
IMAGINATION,

22:18.905 --> 22:22.609
I'M PICTURING...

22:22.642 --> 22:25.512
A PLACE LIKE THIS.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.847
- THIS WAS BUILT IN THE '40s.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.750
BATHROOMS AND KITCHEN,
ALL ORIGINAL.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.119
- AND DON'T YOU JUST ADORE

22:33.152 --> 22:36.523
THE LITTLE PICKET FENCE
OUT FRONT WITH THE ROSEBUSHES?

22:36.556 --> 22:37.724
- YEAH.
- IT'S GOT SUCH, UM...

22:37.757 --> 22:39.125
SUCH CHARACTER.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.727
- YEAH, IT'S GOT CHARACTER,
ALL RIGHT.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.994
YOU'D HAVE TO BE ONE
TO LIVE HERE.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.530
- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
THE MATTER.

22:43.563 --> 22:44.997
- IT NEEDS NEW PLUMBING,
NEW WIRING, A NEW ROOF.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.399
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IT WOULD COST

22:46.433 --> 22:47.600
TO RENOVATE THIS PLACE?

22:47.634 --> 22:50.537
- IT COULD USE
A LITTLE UPDATING.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.171
- WHAT IT COULD USE
IS A WRECKING BALL.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.040
- I SAY WE GO WITH THIS ONE.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.642
IT'S IN MOVE-IN CONDITION.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.810
- IT'S SO COLD.
- CONTEMPORARY.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.946
- DEVOID OF PERSONALITY.
- FULL OF POSSIBILITIES.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.948
- A BARGAIN.
- A WISE INVESTMENT.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.550
- I SAY WE GO WITH THIS ONE.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.151
- IT'S DECREPIT.
- LIVED-IN.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.619
- RUN-DOWN.
- CHARMING.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.154
- CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
- COZY.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.022
- [sighs]

23:10.056 --> 23:11.691
WHAT DO YOU THINK, JENNIFER?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.093
- YEAH, JENNIFER,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

23:14.126 --> 23:16.529
- I THINK...

23:16.563 --> 23:19.432
THAT I'LL JUST LET YOU GUYS
TALK IT OVER.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.071
[bell dings]

23:25.104 --> 23:26.639
[mixed chatter]

23:26.673 --> 23:27.940
- HERE YOU GO, GIRLS.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.543
TWO PINK PLATE SPECIALS.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.911
- OH, WHAT'S ALL THIS?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.513
WE ONLY ORDERED A TUNA MELT.
- TO SHARE.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.114
- OH, I MUSTA GOTTEN
THE ORDER WRONG.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.584
- YOU NEVER GET
THE ORDER WRONG.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.818
- SHH.
[whispering] WE'RE FAMILY NOW.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.687
[giggles]

23:40.720 --> 23:44.123
- WE MAY NOT BE FAMILY FOR LONG
UNLESS MICHAEL COMES THROUGH.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.792
- 'SCUSE ME?

23:45.825 --> 23:47.193
DID I JUST HEAR...

23:47.226 --> 23:49.195
MY BELOVED SON'S NAME
MENTIONED?

23:49.228 --> 23:51.197
- MELANIE WAS JUST SAYING--

23:51.230 --> 23:53.199
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING, MEL?

23:53.232 --> 23:55.535
- W-WE'RE IN A BIT
OF A TIME CRUNCH.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.137
- THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.
MICHAEL CAN DO THIS.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.939
HE'S A RED-BLOODED,
ALL-AMERICAN GAY BOY,

23:59.972 --> 24:01.774
WHICH MEANS
HE HAS A WHACK-ATTACK,

24:01.808 --> 24:03.676
OH, THREE, FOUR TIMES A DAY.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.678
- WELL, THEN HE BETTER
START WHACKING.

24:05.712 --> 24:08.014
WE ONLY HAVE A THREE-DAY WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.549
- SPEAKING OF WINDOWS,

24:09.582 --> 24:11.984
DO YOU MIND
IF I PUT THIS UP IN YOURS?

24:12.018 --> 24:14.954
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.222
- SAY HEY TO MY NEW ACCOUNT.

24:16.255 --> 24:17.824
- THAT FASCIST PIG?

24:17.857 --> 24:20.960
- OH, IT'S LIKE
"WOODSTOCK REMEMBERED."

24:20.993 --> 24:22.261
I'LL HAVE
A REGULAR COFFEE TO GO.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.030
- JESUS, BRIAN,

24:24.063 --> 24:25.698
YOU KNOW HOW STOCKWELL FEELS
ABOUT GAY PEOPLE.

24:25.732 --> 24:26.966
HOW COULD YOU SELL YOUR SOUL
TO THE DEVIL?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.568
- I HAVEN'T SOLD MY SOUL,

24:28.601 --> 24:30.002
I'M JUST BILLING
FOR TIME AND EXPENSES.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.571
- WELL, ANYTHING YOU DO
TO HELP HIM GET ELECTED

24:31.604 --> 24:32.905
IS HURTING US.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.240
- HERE'S YOUR ORDER,
PIPING HOT.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.976
SCALD YOURSELF.
- THANKS FOR THE TIP, DEB.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.645
EXCUSE ME IF I DON'T
LEAVE YOU ONE.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.112
- WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S
SOMEONE IN THIS WORLD

24:40.146 --> 24:41.781
LEFT WITH A LITTLE INTEGRITY.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.983
ETHAN WAS OFFERED A CONTRACT
WITH A BIG AGENT,

24:44.016 --> 24:45.718
AND HE TURNED IT DOWN

24:45.752 --> 24:47.654
'CAUSE THEY WANTED SUNSHINE
HERE OUT OF THE PICTURE.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.256
- MM!
- ETHAN DID THAT?

24:50.289 --> 24:51.624
- IT WOULD'VE MEANT
CONCERT DATES,

24:51.658 --> 24:53.192
EVEN A RECORD DEAL.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.862
- SO NOW HE'S BACK ON
THE STREET, PLAYING FOR PEANUTS?

24:55.895 --> 24:58.531
SOMEONE SHOULD TELL HIM THERE'S
NOTHING NOBLE ABOUT BEING POOR.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.999
[slurps]
MM!

25:00.032 --> 25:03.002
OW! FUCK!

25:03.035 --> 25:05.672
- OOPS.
[chuckling]

25:05.705 --> 25:08.741
- [moaning]

25:08.775 --> 25:11.277
- JERKING OFF USED TO BE FUN.
IT WAS--

25:11.310 --> 25:13.012
IT WAS SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.648
AND NOW IT'S--
NOW IT'S THIS OBLIGATION.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.016
YOU KNOW, THERE--
THERE'S THIS...

25:17.049 --> 25:18.751
BIG TIME CLOCK
HANGING OVER MY HEAD,

25:18.785 --> 25:20.953
AND PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING ME
TO PERFORM,

25:20.987 --> 25:23.623
AND IT'S FUCKING HARD WORK.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.926
HOW THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO CUM ON DEMAND?

25:26.959 --> 25:28.695
- [loud moaning]

25:28.728 --> 25:32.298
- TRUST ME, IT CAN BE DONE.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.166
LOOK, YOU'RE MAKING TOO MUCH
OUT OF THIS.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.902
YOU'RE CREATING A MENTAL BLOCK.
YOU JUST--

25:35.935 --> 25:38.938
YOU NEED TO RELAX,
EASE INTO IT.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.073
GET BEN TO GIVE YOU A HAND.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.709
- I TRIED THIS MORNING,

25:42.742 --> 25:44.677
BUT HE PRACTICALLY
BIT MY HEAD OFF.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.946
[opening/closing door]

25:52.619 --> 25:56.689
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.926
- WHO'S THAT?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.694
- THAT'S MY NEW SUPER-JERKER.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.196
I HAVE YOU TO THANK.
IT'S "RAGING HARD-ON".

26:04.230 --> 26:07.700
HE LOOKS GREAT ON-SCREEN.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.135
UH, MOVE A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.839
THAT'S IT.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.107
ALL RIGHT, NOW LET'S SEE YOU
UNLEASH THOSE SUPERPOWERS.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.946
[chuckling]

26:19.979 --> 26:22.749
ANYWAY, AS I WAS SAYING, YEAH,
YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX.

26:22.782 --> 26:25.351
STOP FRETTING,
'CAUSE YOU'LL SEE A HOT GUY,

26:25.384 --> 26:27.586
YOU'LL GET TURNED ON, YOU...

26:31.758 --> 26:35.227
- [moaning]

26:35.261 --> 26:37.263
YEAH.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.104
- MICHAEL?

26:45.137 --> 26:47.039
- TEDDY?

26:47.073 --> 26:48.741
- YEAH?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.042
- DO YOU HAVE A CUP?

26:50.076 --> 26:52.979
- A CUP?

26:53.012 --> 26:55.748
A CUP.
UH...

26:55.782 --> 26:57.717
YEAH, A CUP, UH--

26:57.750 --> 26:59.218
FUCK! A CUP.
A CUP.

27:04.323 --> 27:08.795
- * JUST DIAL ME UP
AND I'LL COME OVER *

27:08.828 --> 27:13.399
* UNTIL YOU SAY
THAT IT'S TIME *

27:13.432 --> 27:15.134
* ALL RIGHT

27:15.167 --> 27:20.406
* AS LONG AS IT TAKES,
UNTIL THE FEVER BREAKS *

27:20.439 --> 27:25.211
* 'CAUSE I'M READY
WHENEVER YOU CALL *

27:25.244 --> 27:27.346
- OH!
- TA-DA! SUCCESS!

27:27.379 --> 27:29.015
- AT LAST!
- I ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.282
SOME IDIOT IN A PICK-UP TRUCK
ALMOST HIT ME.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.684
- THANKS, SWEETIE!

27:33.452 --> 27:34.921
HONEY!

27:34.954 --> 27:36.288
- SURE, LINZ!

27:36.322 --> 27:37.824
NO PROBLEM.
GOOD LUCK.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.793
[panting]

27:42.829 --> 27:45.097
- GOT IT!
MICHAEL'S SPERM.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.166
- OH, THERE'S A...
LOT OF IT.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.701
- WE KNEW HE WAS GENEROUS.

27:48.735 --> 27:51.738
NOW, QUICK,
GET YOUR LEGS UP.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.443
MEL, THIS ISN'T
THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.045
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TAKE OFF YOUR PANTIES.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.314
- OH, RIGHT!

28:02.348 --> 28:04.951
[sighs]

28:07.887 --> 28:09.455
JUST THINK.

28:09.488 --> 28:13.225
WE'RE MAKING A BABY.
A LIFE.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.327
- OKAY, NOW SPREAD YOUR LEGS.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.829
- WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

28:16.863 --> 28:21.233
WE NEED TO EXPERIENCE
THIS MOMENT.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.304
- SWEETIE...

28:30.843 --> 28:33.846
I LOVE YOU.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.048
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.096
- OKAY?

28:50.129 --> 28:53.399
READY?
- YEAH.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.137
- AFTER WHAT
I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

28:58.170 --> 29:00.439
I COULD USE A NIGHT OF BABYLON
TO TAKE MY MIND OFF OF PUSSY.

29:00.472 --> 29:01.974
- [chuckles]

29:02.008 --> 29:03.275
WHO TOLD YOU TO THINK
ABOUT IT?

29:03.309 --> 29:05.044
- I COULDN'T HELP IT,
YOU KNOW?

29:05.077 --> 29:06.913
KNOWING I WAS SENDING MY LITTLE
SOLDIERS OFF TO DO BATTLE.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.915
- I'M SURE THEY KNEW
IT WAS FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.850
- I WONDER IF IT WORKED.

29:10.883 --> 29:14.253
- THE OLD TURKEY BASTER'S PUT
MORE THAN ONE BIRD IN THE OVEN.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.889
AH, FUCK.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

29:16.923 --> 29:20.159
- OKAY.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.338
- KEEP YOUR MONEY.
I DON'T NEED IT.

29:32.371 --> 29:35.207
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.043
YOU'RE STILL WORKING THE
STREETS LIKE ANY OTHER WHORE.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.410
- I'M NOT A WHORE.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.179
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.447
THEY PEDDLE THEIR ASSES,

29:41.480 --> 29:43.282
YOU'RE SELLING YOUR MUSIC,
YOUR...

29:43.315 --> 29:45.051
FORGIVE THE EXPRESSION,
SOUL.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.053
- AND WHAT THE FUCK
WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT,

29:47.086 --> 29:49.021
FORGIVE THE EXPRESSION,
SOUL?

29:49.055 --> 29:51.290
- I KNOW THAT YOU MUST'VE WORKED
EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE

29:51.323 --> 29:53.092
SINCE YOU WERE A KID...

29:53.125 --> 29:55.227
PLAYING UNTIL YOUR FINGERS
WERE NUMB.

29:57.196 --> 30:00.432
POURING YOUR HEART INTO EVERY
MEASURE TO MAKE IT PERFECT...

30:00.466 --> 30:03.802
SO THAT ONE DAY YOU WOULD BE
A GREAT ARTIST.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.107
BUT...

30:08.140 --> 30:13.312
WHO'S GOING TO HEAR YOU NOW?

30:13.345 --> 30:15.181
- WHY DO YOU GIVE A SHIT?

30:15.214 --> 30:18.350
- BECAUSE YOU DESERVE
TO BE HEARD.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.255
- THEY WANTED ME TO SELL OUT.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.457
- YOU SHOULD DO IT.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.359
- SO YOU CAN GET JUSTIN BACK?
- [chuckling]

30:27.393 --> 30:29.128
I DON'T WANT HIM.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.462
I JUST HATE TO SEE SOMEONE
HOLDING ONTO THEIR INTEGRITY

30:30.496 --> 30:32.098
FOR NO GOOD REASON.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.532
- I'D EXPECT YOU TO SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

30:33.565 --> 30:37.003
YOU PROBABLY WOULDA PLAYED
FOR THE NAZIS TOO.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.504
- IF IT HAD KEPT ME ALIVE
FOR ONE MORE DAY,

30:38.537 --> 30:42.274
YOU'RE GODDAMN FUCKING RIGHT
I WOULD.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.877
ALL THEY'RE ASKING IS FOR YOU
TO PLAY THEIR GAME.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.212
IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY

30:46.245 --> 30:47.613
TO PLAY IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.215
- I'D RATHER WORK THE STREET,
THANK YOU.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.617
- WELL, THAT'S YOUR CALL.

30:51.650 --> 30:56.522
BUT THERE'S NOTHING NOBLE
ABOUT BEING POOR.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.372
[dance music]

31:13.405 --> 31:15.574
*

31:15.607 --> 31:19.078
[cheering]

31:51.978 --> 31:54.480
- THE ONE I LIKE
IS IN MOVE-IN CONDITION,

31:54.513 --> 31:56.482
A PERFECT SPACE
AT A PERFECT PRICE.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.952
- AND THE ONE I LIKE HAS
THE SWEETEST LITTLE KITCHEN

31:59.986 --> 32:03.022
WITH A BREAKFAST NOOK
AND A BACK ROOM.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.456
- A BACK ROOM?

32:04.490 --> 32:06.558
- THAT WE CAN CONVERT
INTO A DEN--

32:06.592 --> 32:08.094
- TURN IT INTO
A FULLY-EQUIPPED DUNGEON

32:08.127 --> 32:09.495
YOU CAN SELL TO SOME
LEATHER QUEEN

32:09.528 --> 32:11.163
FOR TWICE
WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.166
- LOOK, EM,
I KNOW YOU LOVE THAT HOUSE.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.567
IT'S THE HOUSE
OF YOUR DREAMS,

32:15.601 --> 32:17.569
BUT DREAMS AREN'T PRACTICAL.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.305
NOW, I HAPPEN TO KNOW
ABOUT PROPERTY VALUES

32:19.338 --> 32:20.973
AND INVESTMENT POSSIBILITIES.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.075
AND I'M TELLING YOU--
- A-A-ALL RIGHT.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.576
ALL RIGHT, TEDDY,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

32:24.610 --> 32:27.513
IF IT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY,
BEING "PRACTICAL,"

32:27.546 --> 32:29.748
WE WILL GO WITH THE HOUSE
THAT YOU LIKE.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.250
O-OKAY?
IT--

32:31.283 --> 32:32.518
IT-IT-IT-IT'S--
IT'S FINE.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.186
NOW CAN WE PLEASE, PLEASE

32:34.220 --> 32:37.323
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
MORE PLEASANT?

32:37.356 --> 32:40.659
- ISN'T THAT THE SECOND ONE
THAT'S O.D.ed TONIGHT?

32:40.692 --> 32:42.061
- MUST BE A BAD BATCH.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.729
- OR SOME DUMB KID
WHO SHOULD KNOW

32:43.762 --> 32:45.531
NOT TO TAKE CANDY
FROM STRANGERS.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.399
- IT NEVER CHANGES.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.101
SOMEBODY DROPS.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.602
WE DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE DEAD OR ALIVE,

32:50.636 --> 32:52.204
BUT NOBODY MISSES A BEAT.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.772
THE THUMPA-THUMPA GOES ON.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.775
- SO WHO WANTS ANOTHER COSMO?

32:56.808 --> 32:59.211
- HEY, BABY.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.746
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:00.779 --> 33:05.151
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT THE GYM.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.153
- I WAS MISSING YOU.

33:10.389 --> 33:14.426
YOU STILL LOVE ME?

33:17.696 --> 33:21.100
MM, SO HOW ABOUT...

33:21.133 --> 33:22.668
WE FIND A DARK,
SECLUDED CORNER

33:22.701 --> 33:24.536
WHERE I CAN KISS YOU
AND SUCK YOU AND--

33:24.570 --> 33:26.505
- I'D LOVE TO,

33:26.538 --> 33:28.307
BUT I-I PROMISED MEL AND LINZ
I'D BRING THEM ANOTHER LOAD.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.109
- JESUS CHRIST!

33:30.142 --> 33:31.410
SINCE WHEN DO THESE FUCKING
LESBIANS CONTROL OUR LIFE?

33:31.443 --> 33:33.112
- IT'S ONLY
FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.780
- FORGET IT.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.648
- WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

33:36.682 --> 33:39.251
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO PISS YOU
OFF THESE DAYS,

33:39.285 --> 33:42.288
ESPECIALLY ME.

33:47.559 --> 33:50.062
- [groans]

33:50.096 --> 33:53.199
- BETTER GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
- YEAH.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.734
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THE DOORS
THAT WOULD OPEN FOR US

33:55.767 --> 33:58.737
IF STOCKWELL WERE ELECTED?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.340
HIS CORPORATE BACKERS WOULD BE
HURLING THEMSELVES AT US

34:01.373 --> 34:03.809
TO HANDLE THEIR ACCOUNTS.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.178
IT COULD BE
THE CRITICAL MASS WE NEED

34:06.212 --> 34:08.480
TO LAUNCH THE NEW YORK OFFICE.

34:08.514 --> 34:12.218
- IF HE WINS, AND...
IF HE COMES BACK.

34:12.251 --> 34:15.754
- YOUR FAVOURITE CLIENT IS
IN THERE, WAITING FOR YOU.

34:15.787 --> 34:18.357
- HMM, THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP,
CYNTHIA.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.326
- COULDN'T HE CALL FIRST?

34:20.359 --> 34:24.330
- HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.565
MORNING, JIM.
- GOOD MORNING.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.167
- I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET GARDNER VANCE.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.568
HE'S MY PARTNER IN THE FIRM.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.170
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.638
- PLEASURE HAVING YOU WITH US.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.641
- SO WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

34:35.674 --> 34:39.478
- I BELIEVE I'VE FOUND SOMETHING
THAT'LL MAKE ME POP.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.864
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?

34:58.897 --> 35:01.767
- A CELEBRATION.

35:07.373 --> 35:10.142
- THAT STUFF'S NOT CHEAP.

35:10.176 --> 35:14.280
- COST ME MY ENTIRE DAY'S WAGES,
BUT YOU ARE WORTH IT.

35:17.783 --> 35:22.221
- SO, WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

35:22.254 --> 35:27.293
- YOU AND ME, BEING TOGETHER.

35:27.326 --> 35:30.162
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

35:30.196 --> 35:33.365
- NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.267
- WHY WOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN?

35:36.935 --> 35:40.472
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT SIGNING THE DEAL.

35:46.212 --> 35:49.648
- WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.951
- I CAN'T PLAY
ON THE STREET FOREVER.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.787
- NO ONE EXPECTS YOU TO.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.789
BUT THIS GUY...

35:57.823 --> 35:59.791
WANTS YOU TO DENY
WHO YOU ARE...

35:59.825 --> 36:02.228
TO DENY US.

36:02.261 --> 36:05.831
- THERE'S NOTHING NOBLE
ABOUT BEING POOR.

36:05.864 --> 36:10.969
- WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

36:11.002 --> 36:12.538
SO WHEN YOU'RE SAYING

36:12.571 --> 36:14.306
THAT WE'LL BE TOGETHER
NO MATTER WHAT,

36:14.340 --> 36:16.442
HOW EXACTLY ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

36:16.475 --> 36:18.877
- WE'LL MAKE IT AN ADVENTURE.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.348
SECRET RENDEZVOUS,
TORRID ENCOUNTERS.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.416
- I CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET ONCE,
I'M NOT GOING BACK IN.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.752
- I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

36:26.785 --> 36:30.456
ALL I'M SAYING IS PEOPLE DON'T
NEED TO KNOW WHO WE ARE...

36:30.489 --> 36:33.592
OR WHAT WE MEAN TO EACH OTHER.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.795
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT WE KNOW.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.981
- WHEN I WAS GROWING UP
BACK IN HAZELHURST,

36:56.014 --> 36:59.385
MY FAMILY WAS SO POOR THAT,
ONE YEAR,

36:59.418 --> 37:01.787
WE ALL HAD TO LIVE IN A TENT.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.589
- THAT IS POOR.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.758
- TRAILER TRASH WOULD'VE BEEN
A STEP UP FOR US.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.727
AS FOR HAVING OUR OWN HOUSE,

37:08.760 --> 37:11.330
GOD, THAT WAS BEYOND EVEN
MY WILDEST DREAMS.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.899
- WELL, NOW YOU'RE FINALLY
GOING TO HAVE ONE.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.734
- MMM.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.270
EVEN IF IT'S NOT THAT
SWEET LITTLE COTTAGE.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.672
MMM, MICHAEL,
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN IT.

37:20.706 --> 37:23.675
IT WAS SO WARM, SO WELCOMING.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.010
YOU--

37:25.043 --> 37:29.047
YOU WALK THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR, AND--

37:29.080 --> 37:30.649
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:30.682 --> 37:32.418
I'M NOT GOING
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.486
I AM GONNA COUNT MY BLESSINGS

37:34.520 --> 37:36.488
AND BE GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT I'VE GOT--

37:36.522 --> 37:38.490
A GOOD DEAL...

37:38.524 --> 37:42.060
A SMART INVESTMENT...

37:42.093 --> 37:44.863
AND SOMEHOW...
I'LL LEARN TO LOVE IT.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.908
- HEY!
- HEY.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.778
- MMM, THEY ACCEPTED OUR OFFER.
MWAH!

37:59.811 --> 38:01.813
- CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU GUYS ARE HOMEOWNERS.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.582
HOW EXCITING!

38:03.615 --> 38:05.917
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE OWNING
THE ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.519
- EVEN WHEN IT LEAKS.
- [chuckles]

38:07.553 --> 38:09.321
AND HAVING YOUR OWN BACKYARD.

38:09.355 --> 38:10.856
- EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE
TO KEEP RESEEDING IT

38:10.889 --> 38:12.958
'CAUSE THE GODDAMN CRAB-GRASS
KILLS EVERYTHING.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.827
- OR KNOWING THAT IF THE COLD,
COLD WORLD TREATS YOU LIKE SHIT,

38:15.861 --> 38:18.930
IT'S STILL YOURS
TO KEEP YOU WARM.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.832
- EVEN IF THE FUCKING FURNACE
KEEPS BREAKING DOWN.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.534
- VIC!

38:22.568 --> 38:23.835
- I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
VERY HAPPY THERE.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.404
- I KNOW IT.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.540
- OH, GOD, LOOK AT THESE
GORGEOUS ROSEBUSHES.

38:28.574 --> 38:29.941
- AND THAT CUTE LITTLE
PICKET FENCE.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.410
- NO, NO.
NO ,NO, NO.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.678
THOSE--
THOSE ARE THE WRONG PICTURES.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.979
THAT'S ANOTHER HOUSE.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.681
- NO, THOSE ARE
THE CORRECT PICTURES.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.483
- NO.
- THAT'S...

38:37.516 --> 38:38.984
OUR NEW HOUSE.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.356
JENNIFER WAS BRILLIANT.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.024
SHE GOT THEM TO KNOCK
THE PRICE DOWN.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.694
BUT, LOOK,
EVEN IF SHE HADN'T...

38:48.727 --> 38:50.829
I WANTED YOU TO BE HAPPY.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.731
SO...

38:52.764 --> 38:55.100
- TEDDY.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.102
OH, MY GOD.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.771
WE BOUGHT A HOUSE!
HA HA!

38:59.805 --> 39:01.707
WE BOUGHT A HOUSE!

39:01.740 --> 39:03.575
- HA HA!

39:03.609 --> 39:05.110
- [on television] AFTERMATH
OF THREE DRUG OVER-DOSES

39:05.143 --> 39:07.579
AT BABYLON.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.114
- LOOK.
SHH, SHH, SHH.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.583
- LAST NIGHT'S UNFORTUNATE
AND TRAGIC INCIDENT

39:11.617 --> 39:13.785
HAS REAFFIRMED MY COMMITMENT
TO PUT AN END

39:13.819 --> 39:15.654
TO THE CORRUPTION
AND DRUG USE

39:15.687 --> 39:17.489
THAT PLAGUE CERTAIN PARTS
OF OUR CITY.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.858
- WHY DOESN'T HE JUST SAY
LIBERTY AVENUE?

39:19.891 --> 39:22.661
- AS MAYOR,
I WILL INTENSIFY MY FIGHT

39:22.694 --> 39:24.796
TO TAKE BACK THE STREETS...

39:24.830 --> 39:26.031
- SINCE WHEN ARE THEY HIS?

39:26.064 --> 39:28.033
- TO PROTECT OUR KIDS,

39:28.066 --> 39:31.537
TO MAKE PITTSBURGH
FAMILY FRIENDLY.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.772
- "FAMILY"?
WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE?

39:57.929 --> 40:00.899
[dance music]

40:00.932 --> 40:08.206
*

40:08.239 --> 40:11.076
[cheering]

40:29.260 --> 40:32.030
- [moaning]

40:34.966 --> 40:36.735
SLOWER.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.877
- FUCK OFF.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.579
- I'M BUSY.

40:47.613 --> 40:50.582
- FUCK...OFF!

40:52.518 --> 40:54.586
- YOU SHOULD TAKE A NUMBER,
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.122
- AND YOU SHOULD KEEP
YOUR BIG FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.757
- I WASN'T THE ONE GIVING
THE BLOW JOB.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.091
- WHAT DID YOU TELL ETHAN?

41:00.125 --> 41:02.694
- THE TRUTH.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.963
- "THERE'S NOTHING NOBLE
ABOUT BEING POOR"?

41:04.996 --> 41:06.965
- OH, HE ACTUALLY LISTENED.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.000
- HE MORE THAN LISTENED.
HE SIGNED THE PAPERS.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.736
- GOOD FOR HIM.

41:10.769 --> 41:13.138
- WHAT,
THAT HE SOLD OUT?

41:13.171 --> 41:15.707
- MAYBE HIS RECORDINGS'LL
DO THE SAME.

41:15.741 --> 41:18.577
ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I COULD
NEVER REALLY STAND VIOLIN MUSIC.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.112
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE
TORTURING A CAT.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.048
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

41:23.081 --> 41:26.885
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

41:26.918 --> 41:28.787
YOU EXPECT HIM TO SACRIFICE
HIS CAREER

41:28.820 --> 41:31.823
FOR A PIECE
OF BLONDE BOY ASS?

41:34.325 --> 41:39.064
IS THAT YOUR IDEA OF TRUE LOVE,
SUNSHINE?

41:41.199 --> 41:44.269
- * YOU SMILE

41:44.302 --> 41:48.607
* YOU ALWAYS SMILE

41:48.640 --> 41:51.677
* WHEN EVERYONE

41:51.710 --> 41:53.779
* IS CRYING

41:56.782 --> 42:00.686
* BY MYSELF,
BY MYSELF *

42:00.719 --> 42:04.890
* BY MYSELF

42:04.923 --> 42:08.259
* LIVE YOUR LIFE
