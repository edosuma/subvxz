02:07.848 --> 02:08.556
Damn!

02:21.280 --> 02:25.258
<i>In the state capital today, the legislature
is winding up the current session</i>

02:25.259 --> 02:28.276
<i>and by this time next week
all representatives will be involved</i>

02:28.277 --> 02:31.084
<i>wooing constituents
for next springs primary.</i>

02:31.285 --> 02:34.030
<i>The weather bureau marks
the current Victoria County</i>

02:34.031 --> 02:38.750
<i>temperature of 98 degrees and climbing.
A high of a 102 is predicted.</i>

02:50.062 --> 02:52.271
Looks like Woody's farm did it again.

02:56.973 --> 02:58.121
What happened?

02:59.049 --> 03:02.907
The next time we go on a trip,
I'm riding this Jeep with you guys.

03:03.953 --> 03:06.004
Look at the size of that hole!

03:06.205 --> 03:09.953
- Didn't you bring a spare?
- Hoi! Woody came prepared.

03:10.188 --> 03:12.533
Only didn't have any air in it.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.632
He went off to the gas station.

03:15.882 --> 03:18.147
He'll never find
one on this old road.

03:18.148 --> 03:19.279
Serves him right.

03:19.580 --> 03:23.056
Poor thing!
I'll bet his feet are aching.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.243
Hello?

04:10.137 --> 04:12.284
Hey, can I get some service?

04:15.568 --> 04:16.579
Hello?

04:27.964 --> 04:28.969
Hey?

04:40.378 --> 04:41.385
Hello!

04:42.120 --> 04:43.801
Anybody back here?

04:52.651 --> 04:53.744
Excuse me.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.230
Ma'am...

05:16.193 --> 05:17.614
Open the door.

05:18.275 --> 05:20.187
Open the door!

06:26.750 --> 06:27.594
Let me go!

06:28.734 --> 06:29.412
Let me go!

07:47.215 --> 07:48.467
Let me go!

09:27.510 --> 09:29.907
Look, where you going we're
hot all over those springs.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.523
You know, these
tourist traps are all alike...

09:35.724 --> 09:37.764
They give you a big billboard,
and when you get there...

09:37.765 --> 09:40.722
there's nothing but a roadside shack
and a bunch of cheap drinking.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.112
Look!

09:59.632 --> 10:01.473
It's Woody's tyre.

10:01.474 --> 10:04.647
He must have gone this way, right?

10:04.648 --> 10:05.748
Okay.

10:42.273 --> 10:44.090
What happened?

10:44.522 --> 10:46.283
I don't know.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.765
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, man.

11:13.679 --> 11:15.447
What happened?

11:15.918 --> 11:18.925
I never had any trouble
with this thing before.

11:28.236 --> 11:29.327
Shit!

11:31.317 --> 11:34.312
Let me know when you get
your act together, sweetheart.

11:39.336 --> 11:41.226
What do you think it is, Jerry?

11:41.261 --> 11:43.555
Well, I'm a law student.
What do I know about cars?

11:44.802 --> 11:48.918
- Hey you guys, come take a look at this!
- What is it?

11:49.053 --> 11:51.560
I don't know...
I think it's paradise!

12:16.695 --> 12:20.560
And you thought this
was a cheap tourist trap!

12:20.435 --> 12:23.305
Well, I don't know about you
guys, but I'm going swimming!

12:23.852 --> 12:25.786
I don't think you should.

12:25.987 --> 12:28.417
Come on Molly.
Relax for a while.

12:28.644 --> 12:32.551
- We can't go swimming anyway.
- Why not?

12:32.886 --> 12:36.644
- We didn't bring our bathing suits.
- So?

12:38.020 --> 12:40.039
Who needs a bathing suit?

13:46.752 --> 13:48.225
Howdy?

13:48.713 --> 13:50.598
You kids enjoying yourselves?

13:52.191 --> 13:55.665
How about you, Missy?
You look to be having a good time.

13:56.337 --> 13:57.737
Yes, sir.

14:01.970 --> 14:05.403
Used to be I charge 75
cents a day to swim here.

14:06.038 --> 14:07.508
Not no more though.

14:09.288 --> 14:12.973
Used to be I'd have
25 to 30 visitors a day here.

14:12.973 --> 14:17.403
But then the government
decided to build a new highway.

14:28.474 --> 14:30.191
What is your name?

14:30.605 --> 14:32.674
- Molly.
- Molly?

14:33.424 --> 14:34.204
Hey, I like that.

14:34.806 --> 14:36.568
I do not get many visitors, no more.

14:36.863 --> 14:39.266
It seems that most folks
are using the new highway.

14:39.377 --> 14:42.946
I guess they figured, it's gonna get
them to where they're going fast.

14:44.322 --> 14:47.577
Everyone is in such
a damn hurry these days!

14:51.076 --> 14:53.693
Do you know why that is, Molly?

14:54.424 --> 14:55.935
I don't either.

14:56.019 --> 14:59.280
There's not a place like
this in the whole world.

15:01.342 --> 15:03.832
What bring you kids
to this parts anyway?

15:03.964 --> 15:05.359
We didn't mean to trespass...

15:06.913 --> 15:10.165
- Our friend got lost.
- A friend?

15:11.699 --> 15:12.622
You see it...

15:13.203 --> 15:14.259
Their car broke down.

15:14.858 --> 15:18.629
This friend of yours... she a girl too?

15:18.964 --> 15:22.566
No, he's a he.
His name is Woody!

15:23.620 --> 15:27.628
Well, I can't help you.  Ain't see no
one in these parts for weeks now.

15:33.888 --> 15:37.038
I thought I'd better
come down and warn you.

15:44.104 --> 15:46.375
You all best leave
before it gets dark.

15:48.413 --> 15:49.905
What happens at dark?

15:50.398 --> 15:52.977
Obviously a hole fills up
with water moccasins.

15:52.978 --> 15:56.210
If you feel something
wiggling around you feet

15:56.212 --> 15:59.561
it's just the early ones
comes out finding a good spot.

16:13.671 --> 16:15.022
Hey, you guys all right?

16:15.533 --> 16:18.915
- Some old geezer ran us off.
- He didn't run us off.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.989
- Well, he was weird.
- Yes.

16:21.024 --> 16:24.035
- I felt sorry for him.
- Oh, yeah?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.481
Well how do you know he
wasn't some crazy old coop

16:26.482 --> 16:29.070
like to chop up pretty
girls by moonlight.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.070
Yeah, they always get
the pretty ones first.

16:31.071 --> 16:34.122
Well, if that's the case, then you
girls have absolutely nothing to fear.

16:34.258 --> 16:37.044
Very funny, Carl deGraaf.

16:59.807 --> 17:02.188
What seems to be
the trouble, young fella?

17:02.589 --> 17:05.121
Umm.  Not sure.
Can't get it started.

17:05.156 --> 17:08.560
- But I'm not much of a mechanics.
- Well, maybe I can help out.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.163
Why don't you kids hop aboard?
We'll drop by the house for my tools.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.886
Well, it's just down
the road, a piece in.

17:17.820 --> 17:20.991
Well, we really
appreciate that, Mr. Slausen!

17:21.026 --> 17:22.792
My pleasure, Molly.
My pleasure.

17:23.028 --> 17:24.712
Well, come on kids!
Come on!

17:33.099 --> 17:37.629
<i>Welcome to Slausen Museum.
Now gone out of business.</i>

17:46.277 --> 17:48.477
Come on in kids!
Have a look around.

17:53.862 --> 17:55.662
I decorated it myself.

17:56.783 --> 17:59.683
Where did you get all these junk?

17:59.723 --> 18:02.739
Oh it's junk alright.
I'm just a collector at heart.

18:03.644 --> 18:06.240
I can't seem to bring myself
to throw anything away.

18:06.444 --> 18:09.783
See my wife passed away just
after they finished the highway.

18:09.984 --> 18:13.486
And the look of that is,
these junk, my memories.

18:13.987 --> 18:15.805
Let's have that
beer I promised you.

18:22.008 --> 18:23.063
Here we are.

18:28.827 --> 18:30.215
Here you are Molly.

18:31.550 --> 18:35.302
It's too bad you had to close
this place down, Mr. Slausen.

18:35.937 --> 18:38.120
- I'm real sorry.
- Well, thank you, thank you Molly.

18:38.155 --> 18:40.128
But hell, that ain't the worst
thing that ever happened to me.

18:41.063 --> 18:45.087
Hell I was kicked out of the Navy when I
was 19, kicked in the head when I was 20,

18:45.088 --> 18:46.826
... and kicked into jail when I was 21.

18:46.961 --> 18:50.826
And that was just to warm me up
for what life had in store for me.

18:51.761 --> 18:53.987
No sir, it's been a lot worse.

18:54.022 --> 18:58.672
You get to be my age, you start
to understand what living is all about.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.152
This is so life like!

19:02.887 --> 19:05.649
Yeah, my brother got pretty
good at making those figures.

19:05.650 --> 19:06.826
Your brother made these?

19:06.827 --> 19:10.685
And he got so good, they hired him away
from me.  Folks out in the city did it.

19:10.696 --> 19:15.099
He's out there still making dummies
for one of them Wax Museums.

19:15.299 --> 19:16.622
And watch this...

19:35.905 --> 19:37.495
Pretty good heh?

19:37.530 --> 19:40.807
Used to scare the hell out
of kids and yankee tourists.

19:41.541 --> 19:43.320
That's quite a killing.
How did you do that?

19:43.322 --> 19:44.378
No, my brother did that.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.460
He was real good with
mechanical things too you know.

19:46.463 --> 19:48.025
Gears, motors, pulleys
all that sort of stuff.

19:48.030 --> 19:49.374
He was a real talent.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.067
Is that where you live?

19:52.675 --> 19:53.769
Nope.

19:54.404 --> 19:56.355
I live right here in the museum.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.709
- Who lives over there?
- Well ...

20:00.344 --> 20:01.554
Nobody really.

20:02.751 --> 20:04.291
Just Davey.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.272
Who is Davey?

20:10.307 --> 20:12.466
Well, Davey Crockett, who else!

20:16.271 --> 20:19.070
You see, he and General
Custer here couldn't get along,

20:19.074 --> 20:20.480
... so I had to separate them.

20:24.002 --> 20:28.325
You girls mind guarding the place
while me and Jerry fix up his Jeep.

20:29.798 --> 20:31.374
Guard it from what?

20:31.409 --> 20:34.156
Oh, souvenir hunters.

20:37.273 --> 20:38.718
Mr. Slausen!

20:40.181 --> 20:43.133
- Can I use your phone?
- Oh sure, help yourself!

20:43.740 --> 20:45.072
But it doesn't work.

20:47.091 --> 20:48.567
I got nobody to call.

20:51.023 --> 20:54.265
Oh if you are thinking about
wandering around outside...

20:54.738 --> 20:56.034
I wouldn't if I were you.

20:56.898 --> 20:59.975
- Why not?
- Well, I just wouldn't ...

21:00.210 --> 21:03.989
it's not safe at night.
We got trouble with coyotes.

21:05.004 --> 21:06.533
Be back directly.

21:23.495 --> 21:25.268
Something funny about that man.

21:28.274 --> 21:29.507
He's lonely.

21:30.011 --> 21:31.963
Likes living in the
past, that's all.

21:33.627 --> 21:35.975
Something funny
about that house too.

21:36.010 --> 21:39.456
I don't think Mr. Slausen wants
you fooling around out there.

21:39.791 --> 21:43.539
Look, he's hiding something.  I mean,
why else would he want us to stay away?

21:43.574 --> 21:46.660
- Who cares?
- Aren't you curious?

21:46.661 --> 21:48.299
- Nope.
- Well, I am.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.619
Beside, Davey may have
a phone that works.

21:51.054 --> 21:54.319
Eileen, don't go out there.

21:54.354 --> 21:58.167
If I'm not back in 10
minutes inform the posse.

22:42.848 --> 22:43.548
Hello?

22:52.076 --> 22:55.576
<i>Okay by me, I just assumed ...</i>

23:00.198 --> 23:00.998
Hello?

23:09.117 --> 23:10.117
Oh, my God.

23:14.566 --> 23:16.251
Eileen...

23:16.286 --> 23:18.490
Woody?
Is that you?

23:20.125 --> 23:21.164
Woody?

23:23.199 --> 23:25.000
Eileen...

23:28.835 --> 23:30.002
Woody?

24:13.543 --> 24:14.843
Woody?

25:29.387 --> 25:31.658
Look at this!

25:42.109 --> 25:44.324
Look at her features.

25:45.363 --> 25:47.261
Aren't they strange?

25:48.226 --> 25:50.299
Kind of looks like she could move.

25:51.607 --> 25:53.432
What's the matter?

25:54.231 --> 25:56.730
Feels like flesh.

26:02.036 --> 26:04.151
Oh, you're right!

26:05.160 --> 26:09.200
Must be made out of some
special rubber or something.

26:13.518 --> 26:15.552
I don't want to
look at it anymore.

26:17.297 --> 26:19.372
Molly, it's only a mannequin.

26:30.398 --> 26:32.806
- Did you hear that?
- Mm hmm.

26:42.315 --> 26:45.128
- Did you see anything?
- No.

26:48.757 --> 26:50.181
I scared you, didn't I?

26:52.007 --> 26:54.630
You should see your face!
It's white as a sheet.

26:54.698 --> 26:56.680
Excuse me, Mr. Slausen.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.198
No.

26:58.607 --> 27:00.940
We didn't hear your truck.

27:00.945 --> 27:02.557
That's because
Jerry took it to town.

27:02.735 --> 27:05.387
I walked up.  Hell, we
couldn't fix that Jeep of his.

27:06.033 --> 27:08.808
Nice boy that Jerry.
Got a real head on his shoulders.

27:08.882 --> 27:12.900
-You two are married long?
-Oh, a while.

27:13.564 --> 27:15.027
Yeah, you be good to him, you hear.

27:15.465 --> 27:18.223
It's real important a wife
take good care of her husband.

27:18.881 --> 27:21.441
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

27:21.476 --> 27:23.825
My wife was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

27:24.404 --> 27:26.690
What a charmer she was!

27:26.691 --> 27:29.337
She could talk the birds
right down out of the trees.

27:29.618 --> 27:32.517
And a worker too, Molly.
A real good worker.

27:33.771 --> 27:36.574
Man can't ask much
more than that, can he?

27:36.676 --> 27:40.453
She could make a pot of chilly, make your
mouth water just thinking about them.

27:43.247 --> 27:47.366
We were gonna make this
place into a real fine resort.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.409
She wanted to
build a nice hotel ...

27:52.611 --> 27:54.161
down by the spring.

27:57.924 --> 28:00.013
She died so young.

28:02.735 --> 28:05.016
It was cancer that killed her.

28:08.644 --> 28:10.744
She died in my arms.

28:11.227 --> 28:12.732
I'm sorry.

28:14.964 --> 28:16.720
It should have been me.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.058
I'm sorry, I...

28:24.966 --> 28:27.501
I get carried away sometimes.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.566
Where is that other girl?

28:43.469 --> 28:45.996
Oh hmm ... she went outside.

28:45.997 --> 28:47.748
I thought I told her not to.

28:47.967 --> 28:51.318
Well, she ... said she
just wanted to cool off.

28:51.648 --> 28:54.765
I'll bet she's
snooping around outside.

29:21.508 --> 29:22.880
Davey?

29:25.902 --> 29:27.543
Davey, are you there?

29:34.414 --> 29:35.842
Davey.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.400
Oh, my God!

29:58.385 --> 29:59.569
What are you looking at?

29:59.909 --> 30:01.988
Mr. Slausen's photo album.

30:03.770 --> 30:06.063
This must be his brother.

30:06.541 --> 30:08.959
You're a regular
little snoop, Molly.

30:09.618 --> 30:11.620
It was on the coffee table.

30:11.623 --> 30:15.463
Mr. Slausen might not be too happy if he
found you checking through his pictures.

30:16.630 --> 30:18.822
- Becky!
- What?

30:19.519 --> 30:21.184
Look at this!

30:24.198 --> 30:27.846
- It's probably his wife.  So what?
- Don't you see?

30:28.275 --> 30:29.542
See what?

30:35.843 --> 30:38.391
She looks just like
that mannequin there.

30:38.966 --> 30:41.830
You're right.
How weird!

30:48.151 --> 30:50.697
It seems this is the
mannequin of his wife.

30:50.898 --> 30:52.342
I don't know.

30:52.879 --> 30:55.854
Maybe it's just his
way of remembering her.

30:56.152 --> 30:58.533
I loved her very much.

31:03.371 --> 31:05.963
I wanted to keep
her memory alive forever.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.640
This was the best way I know how.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.433
That's the whole purpose
of wax museums, you know.

31:12.434 --> 31:15.680
Keep the memory of the past alive.

31:17.203 --> 31:19.758
And it's easier for me this way.

31:20.442 --> 31:24.186
- She was very beautiful.
- She still is.

31:33.936 --> 31:35.384
Where's Eileen?

31:36.564 --> 31:39.196
I didn't find her.  She...

31:39.197 --> 31:41.216
probably went
back down to the jeep.

31:41.870 --> 31:46.300
- By herself, without telling us?
- Or where else could she be?

31:54.526 --> 31:57.873
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to find her!

31:58.079 --> 31:59.631
With a gun?

32:00.715 --> 32:03.284
Alright, without a gun.

32:07.999 --> 32:09.550
Mr. Slausen!

32:10.589 --> 32:11.671
Can we go with you?

32:11.700 --> 32:14.502
It's best you ladies
stay put, right here.

32:22.736 --> 32:25.230
Stay put, my ass!

32:32.903 --> 32:34.142
Becky!

32:34.904 --> 32:37.609
- Don't go.
- I have to!

32:37.802 --> 32:40.423
No you don't.  You can
stay here and wait for Jerry.

32:40.777 --> 32:42.084
I'm going.

32:42.776 --> 32:44.477
Alright!

32:44.903 --> 32:46.483
I'll come with you.

32:47.404 --> 32:49.649
But I think we're making a mistake.

33:15.971 --> 33:17.401
Did you hear that?

33:17.606 --> 33:19.998
Mm Hmm.
That is Eileen's laugh!

33:20.008 --> 33:21.953
I'll bet you 10 bucks
I know she's in there.

33:21.954 --> 33:25.567
Woody. What if you have some
lucky farm boy.  It has to be, Woody.

33:25.845 --> 33:29.181
Then why don't let those two
a few minutes in his house?

33:29.582 --> 33:32.312
We got to climb the patios
and get the hell at them.

33:32.325 --> 33:35.469
- No, leave them alone.
- They deserve this!

33:35.663 --> 33:38.131
Come on, Becky.  I've had all the
excitement I can take for one day.

33:38.132 --> 33:39.489
I'm going back.
Let's go.

33:39.524 --> 33:41.266
- Chicken!
- That's right!

33:41.552 --> 33:43.904
- Now, let's go.
- I'm going in.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.315
Then you're going in alone,
because I'm going back.

33:46.902 --> 33:48.003
Becky!

33:48.523 --> 33:51.854
Come on, you've got no
business going in there!

34:57.382 --> 34:58.933
Eileen!

34:59.473 --> 35:01.187
I'm in here.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.190
Eileen!

35:11.788 --> 35:12.591
Woody!

35:13.099 --> 35:15.179
I ... I know you're in here.

35:16.181 --> 35:18.050
I'm in ...

35:18.707 --> 35:19.639
Woody.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.247
Come on!

35:29.868 --> 35:31.765
Are we through?

35:39.049 --> 35:40.862
Jesus!

35:43.605 --> 35:45.520
Come on, guys.

35:47.856 --> 35:50.387
Look, that's not funny.

35:52.381 --> 35:54.494
You're beginning to scare me.

35:57.779 --> 35:59.083
Please.

36:00.018 --> 36:01.215
Becky.

36:19.479 --> 36:20.487
Eileen!

36:29.910 --> 36:31.010
Eileen?

36:36.387 --> 36:39.887
Eileen, is that you?

36:41.222 --> 36:42.657
Eileen!

37:19.932 --> 37:22.244
Open the door!

40:12.323 --> 40:14.350
I brought you a visitor.

40:18.399 --> 40:21.420
You are so pretty.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.376
No, please!
Not again!

40:24.276 --> 40:26.827
Why don't you like me?

40:44.717 --> 40:45.617
Beck?

40:46.641 --> 40:47.841
Becky!

40:50.917 --> 40:52.417
Jerry!

40:53.569 --> 40:54.769
Are you alright?

40:56.498 --> 40:57.798
Who is he?

40:58.395 --> 41:00.216
Slausen's crazy brother.

41:00.525 --> 41:02.020
Where are the others?

41:02.910 --> 41:04.605
I don't know.

41:06.573 --> 41:08.925
What's he going to do to us?

41:09.360 --> 41:11.192
He's going to kill us.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.079
I was stopping for
gas along the highway.

41:15.180 --> 41:17.786
I never even saw him coming.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.642
He's crazy.

41:23.299 --> 41:25.021
We're all going to die!

41:29.071 --> 41:31.739
We're all going to die!

42:02.549 --> 42:06.550
We are going to have a party!

42:06.585 --> 42:10.534
How do I look, huh?
How do I look?

42:11.645 --> 42:13.853
Well, here we are.

42:14.359 --> 42:16.516
Here we are.

42:21.870 --> 42:23.109
Drink.

42:26.707 --> 42:28.113
Drink.

42:29.763 --> 42:31.321
Leave her alone!

42:34.558 --> 42:36.876
You can't get away.

42:47.880 --> 42:51.188
- This is for you.
- No.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.388
No ...?

42:57.890 --> 43:00.184
It doesn't matter.

43:05.638 --> 43:09.491
It's time.
The party's over.

43:13.464 --> 43:17.058
Oh, you're so pretty.

43:17.575 --> 43:20.497
It's a shame you have to die.

43:35.565 --> 43:37.618
No!

43:53.760 --> 43:55.245
It'll be quick.

43:56.273 --> 43:57.860
But it won't be easy.

43:58.300 --> 44:00.528
You'll die of fright.

44:04.020 --> 44:05.148
Please.

44:11.336 --> 44:13.104
Please.

44:14.732 --> 44:17.593
It feels good, doesn't it, huh?

44:17.594 --> 44:19.920
Cool and soothing.

44:30.400 --> 44:34.764
It's funny about plastic.
As it starts to dry ...

44:34.939 --> 44:38.732
... it gets very hot,
almost burning the skin.

44:45.006 --> 44:49.684
You'll panic as I seal the lips.

44:59.362 --> 45:01.691
And now the eyes.

45:05.149 --> 45:11.052
Oh, your face is burning now.
The plastic is getting tight.

45:11.352 --> 45:14.536
Your world is dark.

45:15.434 --> 45:18.664
You'll never see again.

45:19.475 --> 45:22.664
It's getting hard
to breathe, isn't it?

45:22.699 --> 45:26.205
I'm going to seal the last hope.

45:27.229 --> 45:31.689
You won't be able to
breathe, but you won't suffocate.

45:32.483 --> 45:38.305
Your heart will burst from fright
before you lose consciousness.

45:53.105 --> 45:55.657
Yes

46:03.394 --> 46:04.609
Now...

46:04.909 --> 46:07.585
you are one of us...

46:08.062 --> 46:11.663
Isn't she pretty?

46:36.350 --> 46:37.777
Stop it!

47:00.945 --> 47:02.879
Oh, my God.

47:51.123 --> 47:54.010
She is a pretty girl.

47:55.118 --> 47:57.976
My brother didn't know about her.

47:57.992 --> 48:00.755
I kept her hidden here.

48:01.831 --> 48:04.646
He doesn't know much, my brother.

48:04.781 --> 48:06.946
He's kind of stupid!

48:08.538 --> 48:13.166
All he cares about is
that foolish museum of his.

48:14.176 --> 48:16.468
I hate him!

48:18.099 --> 48:21.094
One day I'm going
to get rid of him.

48:22.319 --> 48:24.790
He should let me go to the city.

48:25.107 --> 48:28.266
I could work for the Wax Museum.

48:28.267 --> 48:31.318
Oh how much I hate him.

48:31.367 --> 48:34.933
He makes me wear
these stupid masks.

48:34.934 --> 48:37.119
Do you know why?

48:39.933 --> 48:42.618
Do you know why?

48:42.721 --> 48:45.598
Because I'm handsome.

48:45.796 --> 48:48.426
I'm better looking than he is.

48:48.527 --> 48:51.082
He doesn't like his wife to see me.

48:51.183 --> 48:54.883
He is afraid she'll
be attracted to me.

48:55.379 --> 48:58.794
He thinks I stay
here all the time.

48:58.996 --> 49:02.370
He doesn't know what I really do.

49:03.668 --> 49:04.839
I go out.

49:05.574 --> 49:10.244
People don't come here anymore,
so I have to go out to the highway.

49:12.151 --> 49:14.492
The gas station is perfect.

49:15.966 --> 49:19.137
That's where I found Tina.

49:19.729 --> 49:23.206
She's so pretty!

49:34.487 --> 49:36.326
Pretty good trick, huh?

49:36.327 --> 49:39.547
My brother doesn't
like me to do that stuff.

49:39.548 --> 49:43.557
He pretends he doesn't
even know about my power.

49:43.758 --> 49:45.733
But it feels good when I use it.

49:45.735 --> 49:48.102
I shouldn't have to hide it!

49:48.703 --> 49:51.632
I mean I can control it!
I can!

49:51.933 --> 49:55.830
I shouldn't have to hide it!
It feels good!

49:58.047 --> 50:00.669
But it scares me.

50:01.735 --> 50:06.508
Sometimes I really don't
know what I'm doing.

50:09.680 --> 50:13.229
Isn't she pretty?

50:13.755 --> 50:15.673
Eileen!

50:26.974 --> 50:29.244
Who is it?

50:37.269 --> 50:39.679
<i>Molly.</i>

50:39.907 --> 50:42.618
Somebody's there!
I can hear you!

51:02.777 --> 51:06.074
Come on, you guys!
Quit fooling around with me!

51:09.310 --> 51:11.078
Seen my friend?

51:15.078 --> 51:17.703
Wait, little girl.

51:20.382 --> 51:22.486
Little girl!

51:25.266 --> 51:27.127
See my friend!

51:31.296 --> 51:33.630
<i>- Molly!
- Little girl.</i>

51:34.497 --> 51:37.042
<i>Molly!</i>

52:02.849 --> 52:06.073
Don't go away, little girl.

52:13.955 --> 52:16.495
See my friend!

52:20.814 --> 52:23.677
<i>Molly!</i>

53:19.987 --> 53:23.064
- Help me!
- Good Lord girl!  What happened to you?

53:24.972 --> 53:26.618
He's trying to kill me!

53:27.404 --> 53:28.872
Get us out of here!
Hurry!

53:28.873 --> 53:30.992
What happened to you?
What's the matter?

53:31.394 --> 53:34.055
This... thing...

53:34.256 --> 53:36.776
- It's out there!
- Alright, calm down now Molly.

53:36.778 --> 53:38.880
Calm down.
You're safe with me.

53:38.881 --> 53:41.187
What, was it an animal
scared you like this?

53:41.188 --> 53:46.309
No.   It was some
kind of horrible man!

53:59.035 --> 54:02.363
What did this thing look like?

54:03.354 --> 54:05.565
He was wearing ...

54:05.601 --> 54:08.750
He was wearing some kind of mask.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.411
Oh, dear God.

54:17.111 --> 54:19.122
That man was my brother.

54:22.109 --> 54:25.265
You are hiding him, aren't you?

54:25.266 --> 54:28.915
You don't understand, Molly.
He never hurt anyone before.

54:29.186 --> 54:30.896
He killed Woody!

54:31.359 --> 54:34.010
And probably the
others, for all we know.

54:34.391 --> 54:37.837
I was only trying to protect him.
Take care of him!

54:38.245 --> 54:39.780
He is my brother!

54:41.626 --> 54:44.950
It's not his fault,
he's the way he is.

54:45.050 --> 54:46.487
We have to get the police.

54:46.666 --> 54:48.777
I'm sorry, but we have to!

54:49.359 --> 54:51.790
Well Molly, maybe
I better find him first.

54:52.687 --> 54:54.014
Bring him in myself.

54:54.049 --> 54:56.768
No, no!
He's too dangerous!

54:57.911 --> 55:00.126
What mask was he wearing?

55:00.527 --> 55:02.705
Looks like a doll's face.

55:03.610 --> 55:06.612
He's trying to look like
me when I was a little boy.

55:06.613 --> 55:09.088
He always wanted to be like me.

55:09.289 --> 55:11.152
You see, I am his big brother.

55:11.726 --> 55:14.091
He always wanted
everything I ever had.

55:15.309 --> 55:17.681
Including my face.

55:21.990 --> 55:24.870
Look, I'm gonna stop at the
house and turn on the radio.

55:24.871 --> 55:29.402
- He always comes to the radio.
- No, no.  I won't go back there.

55:29.709 --> 55:32.321
Now I don't want them to
shoot him down like an animal.

55:32.549 --> 55:34.652
I just want to get
him back to the house.

55:34.958 --> 55:37.599
So I'll know where to find him,
when I get back from the police.

55:39.709 --> 55:42.191
Alright, what I'm going
to do is turn on the radio.

55:42.392 --> 55:44.459
You don't even have to come in.

55:57.586 --> 55:59.898
- I'm coming with you!
- I'll only be a second!

55:59.899 --> 56:02.889
I'm just going to set the radio
in the window and turn it on.

56:03.813 --> 56:06.355
I'm scared!
I don't want to be alone.

56:06.913 --> 56:08.363
Hop out.

56:14.675 --> 56:17.408
Now I'm going to cork this.
Now here!

56:17.479 --> 56:21.592
If you see anybody not invited,
point this at him and they'll leave.

56:22.285 --> 56:24.247
I don't know how to shoot.

56:24.658 --> 56:28.849
Honey, just point and pull the
trigger. That thing will do the rest.

56:59.038 --> 57:00.695
Mr. Slausen!

57:05.491 --> 57:07.847
Mr. Slausen!
Are you coming?

57:13.899 --> 57:17.548
Mr. Slausen!
Did you hear me?

57:24.662 --> 57:27.435
Mr. Slausen!

57:33.123 --> 57:34.649
Thank you God.

57:35.866 --> 57:40.237
Okay, Mr. Slausen!
Let's go, please!

57:50.037 --> 57:53.598
Mr. Slausen!

57:54.176 --> 57:56.502
Mr. Slausen!

58:04.043 --> 58:06.204
Little girl.

58:32.527 --> 58:34.032
Bang.

58:34.234 --> 58:35.735
Bang!

58:35.636 --> 58:37.904
then you shot me ...

58:38.580 --> 58:40.613
... with blanks.

58:40.930 --> 58:44.394
Bang, bang, you're dead.

58:58.856 --> 59:00.576
You!

59:24.012 --> 59:25.667
Jerry!

59:26.249 --> 59:27.832
Jerry!

59:30.913 --> 59:33.937
Jerry!

01:00:21.582 --> 01:00:24.480
<i>Molly!</i>

01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:42.187
Jerry.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.870
Jerry!

01:00:45.624 --> 01:00:48.169
This is a blade or something.

01:00:49.486 --> 01:00:51.072
Alright ...

01:00:51.073 --> 01:00:52.737
Try slide it over here.

01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:04.848
I got it!

01:01:36.373 --> 01:01:38.526
It's nice and hot.

01:01:42.328 --> 01:01:43.817
No.

01:01:43.853 --> 01:01:46.725
There now ... that's better.

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.099
Go on.

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:50.658
Eat your soup.

01:01:56.984 --> 01:01:59.915
- How's that?
- Let's eat.

01:01:59.918 --> 01:02:02.131
That's what I said.
Let's eat.

01:02:04.726 --> 01:02:07.823
- It's good?
- Yes, it's very good.

01:02:08.053 --> 01:02:09.409
You want some crackers?

01:02:09.443 --> 01:02:12.602
- I'd like some more crackers, please.
- That's what I said.

01:02:14.134 --> 01:02:18.264
- Yes, the crackers are very good.
- Are the crackers good?

01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:24.101
Oh, I got to fix that.

01:02:48.653 --> 01:02:49.905
Who are you?

01:03:01.118 --> 01:03:02.924
Won't you take me home?

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:26.045
Did you see something?

01:04:26.246 --> 01:04:29.785
Shhh.  Be still and
don't fidget so much.

01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:41.681
Damn!

01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:35.237
You can't get away from me, mister.

01:07:29.602 --> 01:07:31.981
What on earth has
happened to you, child.

01:07:38.613 --> 01:07:40.148
Now you just take it easy.

01:07:40.249 --> 01:07:43.216
I'll have you scrubbed
it up in no time.

01:07:50.324 --> 01:07:51.816
Alright, there you are.

01:07:53.435 --> 01:07:56.122
I'll just get my doctoring kit.

01:08:12.837 --> 01:08:14.544
Mr. Slausen!

01:08:15.547 --> 01:08:17.438
Just a minute.

01:08:21.035 --> 01:08:22.649
Becky!

01:08:23.085 --> 01:08:24.085
Woody?

01:08:29.073 --> 01:08:30.100
Woody.

01:10:23.693 --> 01:10:25.619
Wake up, little girl.

01:10:27.273 --> 01:10:28.962
Little girl.

01:10:30.341 --> 01:10:32.391
Come on, girl.

01:10:33.372 --> 01:10:35.608
Everybody's waiting.

01:10:36.902 --> 01:10:38.892
Come on!
Up!

01:11:01.572 --> 01:11:03.532
There we are!

01:11:12.058 --> 01:11:17.103
Little girl.
You look tired.

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:18.477
Stop!

01:13:22.638 --> 01:13:24.135
Stop!

01:13:26.187 --> 01:13:27.942
Stop!

01:13:31.354 --> 01:13:34.378
Stop!

01:13:45.728 --> 01:13:47.483
It's time.

01:13:54.266 --> 01:13:56.262
- What are going to do to me?
- Don't talk!

01:14:03.471 --> 01:14:05.729
This used to be my brother's room.

01:14:08.994 --> 01:14:10.604
He's dead now.

01:14:13.632 --> 01:14:17.798
I trusted him.
He was a good man.

01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:22.568
I always gave him
anything he ever wanted.

01:14:23.947 --> 01:14:25.888
What are you going to do to me?

01:14:26.023 --> 01:14:28.377
Do to you, Molly?
I'm going to take care of you.

01:14:29.412 --> 01:14:32.186
Here, here.
This will warm you up some.

01:14:39.146 --> 01:14:41.310
You're not like the others.

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:45.354
There's something
special about you.

01:14:48.315 --> 01:14:50.067
Isn't my wife pretty?

01:14:56.545 --> 01:14:58.359
You remind me of her.

01:14:59.594 --> 01:15:01.252
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:01.387 --> 01:15:02.529
That's why you're so special.

01:15:08.327 --> 01:15:09.693
There.

01:15:11.128 --> 01:15:12.772
Please don't.

01:15:20.235 --> 01:15:21.576
Mr. Slausen!

01:15:28.542 --> 01:15:30.042
Molly.

01:15:34.377 --> 01:15:35.842
Talk to me.

01:15:37.785 --> 01:15:39.353
Tell me you love me.

01:15:41.805 --> 01:15:43.897
Tell me you love me.

01:15:50.365 --> 01:15:51.431
Tell me.

01:15:52.599 --> 01:15:54.923
I love you.

01:16:36.741 --> 01:16:37.884
I killed her.

01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:43.820
I killed the both of them.

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:47.088
Her and my brother.

01:16:52.928 --> 01:16:55.728
They were whoring behind my back.

01:17:02.324 --> 01:17:04.484
Whoring in my own house!

01:17:06.136 --> 01:17:08.830
Well, she and him had to die.

01:17:10.121 --> 01:17:12.330
I got a legal right to that.

01:17:15.459 --> 01:17:17.445
That's what the Law says...

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.722
A man finds his
wife cheating on him.

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:30.093
He's got a legal right
to kill them both.

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:40.029
Afterwards, I missed her.

01:17:43.589 --> 01:17:46.934
That's when I decided to
make that figure of her,

01:17:46.935 --> 01:17:48.869
the woman in the museum.

01:17:50.175 --> 01:17:52.458
I kept her alive that way!

01:17:55.597 --> 01:17:58.434
I didn't really
want to kill them.

01:17:59.669 --> 01:18:01.181
Not really.

01:18:02.616 --> 01:18:04.069
It was like ...

01:18:05.304 --> 01:18:07.989
I couldn't control myself!

01:18:11.197 --> 01:18:12.251
Molly!

01:18:20.435 --> 01:18:21.575
Jerry!

01:18:23.424 --> 01:18:24.751
Molly!

01:18:31.435 --> 01:18:33.197
Jerry?

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.668
- Jerry!
- Molly!

01:18:58.584 --> 01:18:59.741
Come on, Molly!

01:19:06.557 --> 01:19:08.010
Come on.

01:19:28.071 --> 01:19:31.089
- Where are the others?
- I don't know where they have gone.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:33.925
It's okay, it's all over.
We're going home.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.337
- Now, where are the others?
- Others?

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:40.450
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:19:40.485 --> 01:19:42.787
The other girls,
Eileen and Becky.

01:19:50.213 --> 01:19:51.863
Kill him, Jerry.

01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:57.680
Come on Slausen,  I'm not playing
games with you.  Where are they?

01:19:59.688 --> 01:20:04.165
- I don't wanna have to hurt you.
- You don't want to have to hurt me?

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.816
You?

01:20:09.964 --> 01:20:12.104
Kill him, Jerry!
Kill him!

01:20:12.198 --> 01:20:14.751
He can't, Molly.

01:20:20.799 --> 01:20:21.941
No.

01:20:36.585 --> 01:20:37.775
No.

01:20:48.364 --> 01:20:50.332
This is not happening.

01:20:53.387 --> 01:20:56.068
This is not happening.

01:20:56.103 --> 01:20:58.535
Oh, but it is, Molly.
Look around!

01:20:58.636 --> 01:20:59.871
They are alive!

01:21:04.172 --> 01:21:05.460
No!

01:21:05.465 --> 01:21:06.725
All be alive, Molly!

01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:08.704
No!
