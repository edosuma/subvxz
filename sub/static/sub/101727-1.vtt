00:45.003 --> 00:48.441
<i>Throughout history,
humans have had a primal instinct to hunt,</i>

00:48.573 --> 00:51.477
<i>to compete, to dominate.</i>

00:51.643 --> 00:53.745
<i>Initially,
survival was a daily necessity.</i>

00:53.878 --> 00:56.315
<i>Kill or be killed.
There was no choice.</i>

00:56.449 --> 00:59.085
<i>And through these battles,
through all the aggression</i>

00:59.218 --> 01:02.488
<i>against the opposition,
a respect developed.</i>

01:02.620 --> 01:04.989
<i>An unexpected camaraderie
was born.</i>

01:05.124 --> 01:07.625
<i>And around the world,
brotherhoods were forged.</i>

01:10.262 --> 01:12.131
<i>But now that we're civilized
and spoiled</i>

01:12.264 --> 01:13.932
<i>by the luxuries
of the modern world,</i>

01:14.066 --> 01:16.435
<i>those instincts
have been dulled.</i>

01:16.569 --> 01:19.405
<i>However, that primal need
to dominate remains.</i>

01:19.538 --> 01:22.074
<i>Even today, people around
the world need an outlet,</i>

01:22.208 --> 01:24.143
<i>an arena to crush
the competition.</i>

01:24.276 --> 01:25.877
<i>And I'm not talking
about fantasy football.</i>

01:26.010 --> 01:27.679
<i>I'm talking about
real competition.</i>

01:27.812 --> 01:31.015
<i>Blood, sweat, and beer.</i>

01:32.016 --> 01:34.587
<i>This is the story
about my group of friends.</i>

01:34.719 --> 01:36.388
<i>And for the last 20 years,
we found that outlet</i>

01:36.522 --> 01:39.391
<i>to unleash our need
to conquer, to win,</i>

01:39.525 --> 01:41.093
<i>to be crowned king,</i>

01:41.227 --> 01:44.363
<i>and to ruthlessly demoralize
our best buddies.</i>

01:48.467 --> 01:51.170
<i>But at the end of the day,
we are lifelong friends,</i>

01:51.303 --> 01:54.306
<i>and nothing could come
between our brotherhood.</i>

01:57.409 --> 01:59.711
<i>Well, almost nothing.</i>

02:32.645 --> 02:34.113
Where are you?

02:34.246 --> 02:36.315
Oh, okay.

02:45.491 --> 02:48.561
Oh, okay. Get some.

02:48.693 --> 02:51.729
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:54.699 --> 02:56.268
Fuck you!

02:56.402 --> 02:58.137
Fuck!

02:58.270 --> 02:59.704
Damn it!

03:03.509 --> 03:06.512
Ow! Fuck!
Aaah! Aaah! Stop!

03:06.645 --> 03:10.282
Fucking stop shooting!
Aaah!

03:12.251 --> 03:14.520
Too much!

03:14.653 --> 03:15.853
Oh, fuck.

03:18.424 --> 03:19.891
Yeah!

03:29.368 --> 03:32.003
- Who's the king?
- You're the king!

03:32.137 --> 03:35.674
I want to say a couple words here.

03:35.807 --> 03:38.043
I should not be
standing here

03:38.177 --> 03:39.877
collecting another
championship,

03:40.011 --> 03:42.047
but I am,
thanks to guys like Doc.

03:42.181 --> 03:45.016
I had you, Shelly.
I had you.

03:45.150 --> 03:46.818
You had me dead
in the fucking water,

03:46.951 --> 03:48.820
- I did, Shelly.
- right there by the tree stump,

03:48.953 --> 03:52.091
and then you... what happened?
You panicked, right? You spazzed out?

03:52.224 --> 03:54.593
That is a good quality
in a doctor, you must admit.

03:54.727 --> 03:57.396
Your patients are very lucky.
We'll let it go, and Zane...

03:57.529 --> 04:00.132
- That's my name!
- "In Zane" in the membrane.

04:00.266 --> 04:03.569
You idiot.
You're such an idiot.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.537
This fucking guy!

04:05.671 --> 04:08.240
And, Durfy, I was really hoping
you'd win, man.

04:08.374 --> 04:11.909
- Oh, thank you.
- 'Cause I wanted to go down on the champion.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.713
Since I'm the champion,
you can go down on me.

04:14.846 --> 04:17.683
- Yeah, I'll start now.
- Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

04:17.815 --> 04:21.687
It's "ding!" Like a bullet off Superman.
That's what that was.

04:21.819 --> 04:24.256
Where's big Bob?
Big Bob! Bobfather!

04:24.390 --> 04:27.226
- Yes!
- The man we owe it all to.

04:27.359 --> 04:29.695
The man who put
all this shit together.

04:29.827 --> 04:32.298
- Bobby, thank you. I love you, brother.
- Love you too, buddy.

04:32.431 --> 04:35.967
And last but not least,
Dixon Bender "like Beckham."

04:36.101 --> 04:39.305
Get over here, Bender.
Bender,

04:39.438 --> 04:41.740
I, uh, I've won, uh,

04:41.873 --> 04:44.209
six championships
in six years.

04:44.343 --> 04:46.211
What do you have
to say about that?

04:46.345 --> 04:48.314
- Well, Shelly, I...
- Oh, we're all out of time.

04:48.447 --> 04:51.283
So sorry, Bender.
Love you, Bobby!

04:51.417 --> 04:53.752
- Whoo!
- I need a beer.

04:53.885 --> 04:55.554
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:55.688 --> 04:59.924
Bender, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry about earlier.

05:00.059 --> 05:02.528
I was just trying to make sure
you were actually dead, you know.

05:02.661 --> 05:05.297
Well, you did.
You shot me, like, 30 times, Shelly.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.800
- Thirty times. You painted a fucking house.
- Yeah.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.168
It hurt.

05:09.301 --> 05:11.103
Aw, sweet, sweet Bender.
Come on.

05:11.236 --> 05:14.773
Come on over here.
You didn't deserve that.

05:14.906 --> 05:16.974
- I'll never do it again, okay?
- All right.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.610
- You hear me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:18.744 --> 05:21.714
'Cause you are the toughest
son of a bitch I know,

05:21.846 --> 05:24.550
and you wear your heart
on your shoe.

05:24.683 --> 05:26.552
Aaah! Fuck!

05:31.490 --> 05:34.326
You can be such
an asshole, dude. Fuck!

05:34.460 --> 05:36.128
- You're 33?
- Yeah.

05:36.261 --> 05:39.765
- Wow!
- You're so good looking for an older guy.

05:39.897 --> 05:42.501
- Yeah! Totally.
- I am not.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.836
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.270
You look like
a movie star.

05:45.404 --> 05:46.871
You seriously think
I look like a movie star?

05:47.004 --> 05:48.273
Yeah, totally!

05:48.407 --> 05:50.509
- You're hot!
- Wow, thank you!

05:50.642 --> 05:53.945
- What do you do?
- Oh, I operate a backhoe.

05:54.079 --> 05:57.249
I dig a lot of, uh,
sewer mains and cesspools.

05:57.383 --> 06:02.019
It's, uh, anywhere where waste
generally dissipates into the soil.

06:02.154 --> 06:05.391
- Like poo? Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.060
Pretty good job.

06:12.498 --> 06:14.600
Your grandparents let you
throw parties like this here?

06:14.733 --> 06:16.068
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

06:16.201 --> 06:18.970
Well, every summer,
last 15 years.

06:19.104 --> 06:22.141
- Oh, my...
- Hello! Who's this beautiful lady?

06:22.274 --> 06:24.143
- Hi, I'm Tiff.
- Tiff?

06:24.276 --> 06:25.878
Tiff, do you know
who this is?

06:26.010 --> 06:27.312
- That's Bob.
- This is Bob.

06:27.446 --> 06:29.681
Bob is the bestest,
sweetest son of a bitch

06:29.815 --> 06:31.717
- in the whole, wide world.
- Are you gonna kiss me on the lips?

06:31.850 --> 06:34.153
I'm gonna kiss you right on your
lips, you big, handsome...

06:34.286 --> 06:37.055
- You guys should kiss.
- I love this guy.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.191
Okay. Nikki calls.

06:39.324 --> 06:41.493
Jesus Christ.

06:41.627 --> 06:44.496
Careful...

06:44.630 --> 06:46.998
Hey, who's got my bucket?

06:47.132 --> 06:49.268
There you are, baby.

06:49.401 --> 06:51.236
Sheldon Baldinger.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.572
Why, Nikki Baldinger?
Hi, wifey.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.374
I think it's time
we have a little chat.

06:55.507 --> 06:58.009
Yeah? What do you want
to talk about?

06:58.143 --> 07:01.180
I think it's time for
my big, strong champion

07:01.313 --> 07:05.184
to take his trophy...
inside.

07:05.317 --> 07:08.320
- Shelly! Shelly! We got a sleeper. Right there.
- Dude.

07:08.454 --> 07:10.955
Mark did a bunch of absinthe.
He's basically in a coma.

07:11.089 --> 07:13.091
So fire up the nut sac.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.927
Time for the old
meat goggles.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.864
Rain check, babe. I'm sorry.
I can't disappoint my fans.

07:18.996 --> 07:22.034
Whoo! Who wants
some balls and gravy?

07:25.103 --> 07:28.307
Balls! Balls! Balls!
Balls! Balls! Balls!

07:28.440 --> 07:29.341
Ugh.

07:29.475 --> 07:32.377
Unbelievable.
Look at this guy.

07:32.511 --> 07:35.547
Why do I do this? Every year,
I get dragged down to these things.

07:35.681 --> 07:38.350
Bunch of grown men
acting like teenage chimps.

07:38.484 --> 07:41.620
Yeah, they're animals.

07:41.753 --> 07:45.657
Poor Mark's passed out. Now he has
balls smeared all over his forehead.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.593
He's a schoolteacher.

07:47.726 --> 07:50.896
It's a good thing
Mark's students aren't here.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.965
All he cares about is work

07:53.098 --> 07:56.134
and beating his buddies at the Buddy
Games, especially you, Bender.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.970
I haven't showered
for three days!

07:58.103 --> 08:00.339
Why don't you
teach him a lesson?

08:00.472 --> 08:02.574
From us. Come on.
It'll be fun.

08:02.708 --> 08:05.944
- What, shoot him? I can't do that.
- Okay.

08:06.078 --> 08:09.348
Two for one.
Two nuts, one guy.

08:09.481 --> 08:12.351
Look familiar, Bender?

08:14.086 --> 08:15.754
- What if I did?
- Yeah, do it.

08:15.888 --> 08:17.623
Left hook. Uppercut.

08:17.756 --> 08:19.191
Body blow. Aaah!

08:19.324 --> 08:21.159
What?

08:21.293 --> 08:23.295
Shel! Shelly!

08:24.129 --> 08:27.132
Bender, you fucked him up
real good, man.

08:27.266 --> 08:30.135
Jesus Christ,
what am I looking at?

08:47.386 --> 08:49.721
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

08:51.089 --> 08:52.958
You know,
I was doing the math

08:53.091 --> 08:54.626
on how many years
we've been coming here,

08:54.760 --> 08:57.162
- and it's five years of Sundays.
- I know.

08:57.296 --> 08:58.931
She's making
the same casserole.

08:59.064 --> 09:00.432
Oh, God.

09:00.566 --> 09:02.334
My mom really
appreciates it though.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.037
And I appreciate you
for coming with me.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.737
I was thinking
that maybe we could

09:05.871 --> 09:08.674
- add something to the Sunday routine.
- Like what?

09:08.807 --> 09:11.543
I'm just gonna keep sliding down
the counter until you figure it out.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.079
We could see
how we like that.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.650
Yeah. You want
to do it right here?

09:27.793 --> 09:30.063
You want to add something
to the Sunday routine?

09:41.873 --> 09:45.611
I'm staring at a picture of myself
as a child staring back at me.

09:45.744 --> 09:47.512
It's horrifying.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.249
Oh, God!

09:53.552 --> 09:55.854
Okay, my buns are warm.

09:55.988 --> 09:57.956
Bless your heart!

09:58.091 --> 10:00.325
Oh, I always forget
to heat those up.

10:00.459 --> 10:03.161
Not a big deal.
I mean, look at your casserole.

10:03.295 --> 10:04.630
- Isn't it good today?
- Oh...

10:04.763 --> 10:06.632
- Did you do something different this time?
- No.

10:06.765 --> 10:09.134
No, you baked a pie.
How am I gonna compete with you?

10:09.267 --> 10:10.736
Oh, I bought
that pie, sweetie.

10:10.869 --> 10:12.304
Bill hates my pie.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.073
What? What's that?

10:14.206 --> 10:15.974
I said,
you hate my pie.

10:16.109 --> 10:19.011
Oh, yeah.
Store pie's better.

10:19.177 --> 10:21.213
You know, I always think
that pie is pie.

10:21.346 --> 10:22.981
You know,
as long as it's warm

10:23.116 --> 10:25.350
and lots of whipped cream,
you know.

10:25.484 --> 10:27.452
- Mmm.
- Bob loves my pie, right?

10:27.586 --> 10:30.288
- I do love your pie. Very much.
- Yeah, Bob loves my pie.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.591
Sounds like you guys
are talking about vagina.

10:32.724 --> 10:34.226
- Oh, Bill!
- What?

10:34.359 --> 10:37.396
Oh, good Lord!
I know what you meant.

10:37.529 --> 10:39.665
No, we were actually
talking about vagina.

10:39.798 --> 10:41.733
- No, we weren't.
- Oh, stop it.

10:44.236 --> 10:46.938
Bobby, when are you
gonna marry this girl?

10:47.073 --> 10:48.407
Mom, please.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.809
- Peas?
- No, Dad. I don't want peas.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.878
I want grandbabies,
for goodness sake.

10:53.011 --> 10:55.180
I know you want grandbabies.
You say that every weekend.

10:55.313 --> 10:57.649
- What are you guys waiting for?
- Mother...

10:59.418 --> 11:01.386
Mary Ann Baldinger?

11:01.520 --> 11:03.488
Uh, give me one second.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.758
Why don't you take him away
somewhere romantic?

11:07.959 --> 11:10.796
Mrs. Baldinger. This is a surprise.
How are you?

11:10.929 --> 11:14.133
Not so good, Bobby.
Sheldon needs you. Now.

11:14.266 --> 11:17.569
- <i>We're at Silver Linings.</i>
- Silver Linings? Like, the rehab?

11:17.703 --> 11:20.472
Yes. I'll explain when you get here.
Come now.

11:23.375 --> 11:25.410
- I'm sorry, you guys. I have to run.
- What?

11:25.544 --> 11:27.080
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'll see you back at the house.

11:27.212 --> 11:29.681
- Do you want me to go with you?
- Nope. You enjoy yourselves.

11:31.249 --> 11:33.885
- Eat your casserole.
- I can...

11:36.321 --> 11:38.390
Okay. Okay.

11:49.035 --> 11:50.302
What?

11:52.071 --> 11:53.238
<i>What is going on?</i>

11:53.371 --> 11:54.840
<i>Shouldn't his wife be here?
Where's Nikki?</i>

11:54.973 --> 11:57.008
<i>Nikki?
The bitch filed for divorce,</i>

11:57.143 --> 12:00.812
sold the shares back to the
investors, and moved to Jamaica.

12:00.946 --> 12:02.514
What?

12:02.647 --> 12:05.317
He is in a dark,
dark place, Bobby.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.054
Sheldon's a good boy.
Do you know what it's like

12:08.187 --> 12:11.256
watching your boy wasting away
in front of your eyes?

12:11.389 --> 12:13.625
I can't even imagine, Mrs. B.
I am so sorry.

12:13.759 --> 12:15.494
I need you to do
something for me.

12:15.627 --> 12:17.029
Yeah, anything. You name it.

12:17.163 --> 12:18.430
Get the boys back together.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.432
Yeah. Whatever you need.
We'll take him out,

12:20.565 --> 12:22.000
- maybe go on a vacation.
- No.

12:22.135 --> 12:24.770
His counselor said Sheldon
needs something to live for.

12:24.903 --> 12:28.040
He needs a win.
He needs those games.

12:28.174 --> 12:29.474
- The Buddy Games?
- Yeah.

12:29.608 --> 12:31.543
No. No, no, no.

12:31.676 --> 12:33.246
That's... That's not
gonna happen.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.680
I'm not asking.
I'm telling.

12:35.814 --> 12:38.084
If you have any compassion
in your soul whatsoever,

12:38.217 --> 12:40.285
you will do this
for my boy.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.588
Oh, don't be a pussy.

12:44.289 --> 12:45.824
You were always
a leader of men.

12:45.957 --> 12:47.926
What did the boys
used to call you?

12:50.096 --> 12:52.564
- The Bobfather.
- And why did they call you that?

12:52.697 --> 12:55.300
Because I was their leader.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.302
Exactly.

12:57.435 --> 12:59.604
Now, you rally
those troops.

13:00.372 --> 13:02.307
- Shake. All right.
- All right.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.709
Oh, you're a good boy,
Bobby.

13:07.146 --> 13:08.380
God...

13:09.815 --> 13:12.818
- Whoop. Excuse me.
- Hey, Bob.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.423
Shelly?

13:18.557 --> 13:20.859
What are you
doing here, Bob?

13:20.992 --> 13:24.130
Holy shit! What...
Uh, you look...

13:24.263 --> 13:26.098
Like a runway model?

13:26.232 --> 13:28.433
You know...

13:29.302 --> 13:31.237
- Why are you here, Bob?
- Uh...

13:32.205 --> 13:34.539
Uh, could we go talk someplace
a little more private?

13:34.673 --> 13:37.943
Sure. Just let
Bruce finish first.

13:38.077 --> 13:39.444
You hungry, fella?

13:39.578 --> 13:41.379
I know it feels like
he's taking stuff off,

13:41.513 --> 13:43.448
but he's actually putting
things on your head.

13:48.987 --> 13:51.257
- Mmm!
- What, you got cocaine in here?

13:51.389 --> 13:52.891
How the fuck did you get
cocaine in here?

13:53.024 --> 13:54.492
Crushed-up SweeTARTS.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.394
Desperate times,
brother.

13:56.528 --> 13:59.865
So, uh, I don't see you
for years,

13:59.998 --> 14:02.667
and then you just show up
on my doorstep like this.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.036
Uh, you don't see me for y...

14:04.170 --> 14:06.038
We've been trying
to track you down for years.

14:06.172 --> 14:09.175
- What do you want, Bob?
- I want my best friend back.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.675
That's what I want.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.145
I want to know
what the hell happened to you.

14:13.279 --> 14:15.847
And why are you here...
Five years?

14:17.582 --> 14:19.784
Oh, come on, man.

14:19.918 --> 14:21.519
Seriously?

14:21.653 --> 14:24.823
What could be so bad that
you had to go down this road?

14:26.424 --> 14:29.128
I lost my right testicle
that night, Bob.

14:30.962 --> 14:33.832
Oh, I... I didn't...
I didn't...

14:33.965 --> 14:35.533
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.270
Yeah, that night
they did surgery.

14:37.402 --> 14:39.138
I didn't feel anything
for days, man.

14:39.272 --> 14:41.573
I mean, it might have been
the OxyContin talking,

14:41.706 --> 14:43.875
but, whoo, son!

14:44.009 --> 14:46.878
But, uh something
still wasn't right.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.147
What do you mean?

14:48.281 --> 14:49.748
I guess
in all the chaos,

14:49.881 --> 14:51.917
nobody thought to check
on my left nut,

14:52.051 --> 14:54.452
- the only one I had left.
- Oh, no.

14:54.586 --> 14:56.122
It got a little
staph infection,

14:56.255 --> 14:59.358
and they had to
remove that one too.

14:59.491 --> 15:00.692
So you...

15:00.825 --> 15:02.427
Lost both my balls?
Yeah.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.364
Ah, Jesus Christ.
I'm so sorry, man.

15:05.497 --> 15:08.433
I had no idea.
I don't even know what to say.

15:08.566 --> 15:12.071
I'm a fuckin' textbook
alpha male, honest.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.605
I am a wrecking ball.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.640
- I am a killing machine.
- Okay. Okay.

15:15.774 --> 15:18.710
I bring food back to the
village and lay all the women.

15:21.147 --> 15:24.716
You know, life hasn't been all that
good to me either, just so you know.

15:24.849 --> 15:27.852
My company is completely
in the shitter.

15:27.986 --> 15:30.889
I'm practically broke.
I'm living in a one-bedroom apartment.

15:31.022 --> 15:32.224
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:34.793 --> 15:38.130
Goddamn it, man! We were on top
of the world, weren't we?

15:38.264 --> 15:41.233
Look, I know we're not as young
and bulletproof as we used to be,

15:41.367 --> 15:43.735
but we got to where we were because
we were good at what we did.

15:43.868 --> 15:47.672
Who says that got to settle because
life dealt us a couple of shitty hands?

15:47.806 --> 15:49.941
You know what we need?

15:50.076 --> 15:51.143
A gun.

15:52.178 --> 15:54.813
No, we don't... not a...
No, we don't need a gun.

15:54.946 --> 15:56.815
Right. Two guns.
One for each of us. Good catch.

15:56.948 --> 15:58.683
You know
what else we need?

15:58.817 --> 16:01.486
- The Buddy Games.
- You out of your fucking mind?

16:01.619 --> 16:03.688
- No.
- That's the reason I'm in this place,

16:03.822 --> 16:05.724
in this goddamn robe,

16:05.857 --> 16:07.759
snorting crushed-up
candies.

16:07.892 --> 16:10.895
I got tits, for Christ's sake!
Fuck the Buddy Games!

16:11.030 --> 16:14.866
Let's not let one little hiccup
destroy 20 years of greatness.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.670
You are...
the Buddy Games.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.606
You are our champion.
You are our king.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.508
- We need you to save us.
- I'm the king?

16:23.641 --> 16:25.211
- You're the king.
- Who's the king?

16:25.344 --> 16:26.611
- You.
- Mm-mmm.

16:26.745 --> 16:28.580
- Shelly.
- Shelly's the fucking king.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.615
If I'm the king, then I get
to decide who's there.

16:30.749 --> 16:32.385
Okay, sure.

16:32.517 --> 16:34.153
Then Bender can't be there.

16:34.286 --> 16:37.289
Really?

16:37.423 --> 16:40.359
- Come on.
- Yeah, he's an asshole, but he's one of us.

16:40.493 --> 16:41.926
What?
After what he did to me?

16:42.061 --> 16:44.330
Then forget it, man.
Fuck you. Save yourselves.

16:44.463 --> 16:47.932
Okay, okay, you know what? Fine, fine.
He doesn't even have to know.

16:48.067 --> 16:50.668
I'll call everybody else
except for Bender.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.304
Get those fucking games
back on.

16:52.438 --> 16:53.738
- Right on. One more thing.
- What?

16:53.872 --> 16:55.341
Let me tell the guys.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.109
- About what?
- My balls.

16:57.243 --> 16:58.643
What balls?

16:59.378 --> 17:02.081
Too soon, sorry.
Come on.

17:03.548 --> 17:05.251
Just give me a...

17:07.652 --> 17:10.021
Bear. Look at you.

17:13.691 --> 17:15.827
What's the matter
with you?

17:15.960 --> 17:18.230
- <i>Tell me you're in.</i>
- Are you kidding me?

17:18.364 --> 17:21.200
Fuck, yeah!
Yeah, I'm in!

17:21.966 --> 17:24.170
Bitches are going down!

17:28.807 --> 17:30.642
Stay Golden.

17:30.775 --> 17:32.911
- <i>Zanester!</i>
- Bobfather!

17:33.045 --> 17:34.813
"Boobfather."

17:34.946 --> 17:37.483
What's up, man?

17:37.615 --> 17:39.884
- <i>The games are back, baby!</i>
- What?

17:40.018 --> 17:41.820
- <i>And Shelly's in.</i>
- You're kidding me.

17:41.953 --> 17:43.355
- <i>No, I'm not.</i>
- Shelly's...

17:43.489 --> 17:45.790
Yeah, count me in, man.
Count me in. Sounds delish.

17:45.924 --> 17:48.860
- <i>All right, buddy, let's talk soon.</i>
- Okay.

17:49.761 --> 17:51.330
Holy shit.

17:51.464 --> 17:53.998
Whoo!

18:03.175 --> 18:06.112
- Bobby!
- <i>Hey, Durfy, you got a minute to talk?</i>

18:06.245 --> 18:08.147
- Uh...
- Okay, that's a cut on rehearsal.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.483
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got a second.

18:10.615 --> 18:14.320
- I'm just shooting a major motion picture right now.
- Please face camera.

18:14.453 --> 18:16.788
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
So what's up, dude?

18:16.921 --> 18:18.690
<i>Buddy Games, they're back.
Are you in?</i>

18:18.823 --> 18:21.460
Um, I feel like that would be a
little weird without Shelly now.

18:21.594 --> 18:23.496
- <i>No, no, he's in.</i>
- Then I'm there.

18:23.628 --> 18:26.198
- I can't wait to see him.
- <i>All right, I'll talk to you soon, buddy.</i>

18:26.332 --> 18:28.567
Thank you, second team.
First team on set.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.169
- Hey, Mr. McDonough.
- Hey, how are you?

18:30.302 --> 18:33.038
Yeah, good.
So your mark is right there.

18:33.172 --> 18:35.006
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're gonna be looking...

18:35.141 --> 18:38.144
- Right. Mm, mm, mm...
- ...right over there. Okay.

18:38.277 --> 18:41.213
Don't be too nervous.
You already got the job.

18:41.347 --> 18:43.382
Maybe grab a quick pic,
though, together?

18:43.516 --> 18:46.585
- Then we can tag each other.
- Inappropriate, but, yeah, sure.

18:46.718 --> 18:48.220
- Have you heard of Facebook?
- Yeah, I guess.

18:48.354 --> 18:49.888
- I'm gonna pop it on there.
- That's great.

18:50.021 --> 18:51.624
Hey, here with
my top dog,

18:51.756 --> 18:53.058
- Neil McDonough.
- Is that a video?

18:53.192 --> 18:54.959
- It is a video. Is that okay?
- Yeah, n...

18:55.094 --> 18:57.163
- You'd rather I take a picture?
- Second team, what are you doing?

18:57.296 --> 18:59.365
One second. I'll just do a video.
I'll be really quick.

19:16.048 --> 19:17.183
Hello?

19:17.316 --> 19:18.450
Hey.

19:19.652 --> 19:23.155
- Looks like someone's been busy.
- I have been busy.

19:24.822 --> 19:26.559
What do you think
about taking a vacation?

19:27.359 --> 19:29.662
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? Oh, my gosh, good.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.896
'Cause I went through our calendars,
and there's a couple things we can move,

19:32.031 --> 19:34.066
and we can make it work out.
We can go anywhere.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.368
Do you smell
something burning?

19:36.502 --> 19:38.537
Oh! Damn it.

19:38.671 --> 19:41.005
Oh! Ugh!

19:41.140 --> 19:42.107
Oh!

19:42.241 --> 19:43.442
Are you...

19:45.810 --> 19:47.946
Dang!
I burned it.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.250
Could you...
Could you turn back?

19:52.084 --> 19:53.619
I made three of these.

19:53.751 --> 19:57.122
The other two didn't actually
turn out so well either, but...

19:57.256 --> 19:58.823
oh, well.

19:58.957 --> 20:02.661
Well, you know what? We can always
scrape it off and still eat the inside.

20:04.729 --> 20:07.966
Oh, I was gonna ask you,
what was going on with Mrs. Baldinger?

20:08.100 --> 20:10.469
Oh, uh...
Yeah, no, that's...

20:10.603 --> 20:13.505
Shelly's not doing so hot.
He is on suicide watch.

20:13.639 --> 20:15.674
- What? Poor Sheldon.
- Yeah.

20:15.807 --> 20:17.109
He needs my help, babe.

20:17.243 --> 20:18.910
Yeah, of course.
Whatever he needs.

20:19.044 --> 20:21.913
Mary Ann thinks that I should
get the guys back together

20:22.047 --> 20:24.683
for the Buddy Games.

20:24.816 --> 20:26.918
- And what'd you tell her?
- Well, no.

20:27.052 --> 20:29.321
- Good.
- At first, and then I said yes.

20:29.455 --> 20:32.191
- And then you said yes?
- Of course. You know?

20:32.324 --> 20:34.993
Are you sure you don't want to
think about this for a second?

20:35.127 --> 20:37.296
- I have thought about it.
- You have thought about it?

20:37.429 --> 20:39.764
It's a really good idea.
What better to get him off his feet?

20:39.897 --> 20:42.800
You really think that getting the guys
together for a weekend of teabagging

20:42.934 --> 20:44.703
will stop Sheldon
from killing himself?

20:44.836 --> 20:47.139
Yeah. I do.

20:47.273 --> 20:49.308
Okay, so then, um,
what's next for us?

20:49.441 --> 20:51.310
Um...

20:52.211 --> 20:53.878
- Oh, my God, you don't know.
- I do know.

20:54.012 --> 20:55.681
- You don't know.
- Yeah, I know.

20:57.449 --> 20:59.451
We've grown up,
and it's not gonna be like it was before.

20:59.585 --> 21:01.153
How do you know?
You haven't seen these guys in forever.

21:01.287 --> 21:03.589
Can somebody
open the goddamn door?

21:03.722 --> 21:05.157
Is that Bender?

21:05.291 --> 21:07.526
Oh, sounds like he's grown up.
I'm gonna go.

21:07.660 --> 21:09.861
You know what? That's a good idea.
Let me deal with him,

21:09.994 --> 21:11.563
and I'll meet you
for dinner later.

21:11.697 --> 21:14.600
- No, Bob, I'm leaving.
- What do you mean, you're...

21:14.733 --> 21:16.635
Okay.

21:16.769 --> 21:19.104
You have the Buddy Games,
right?

21:19.238 --> 21:21.440
I'm taking the helicopter.

21:29.381 --> 21:31.983
Dixon fuckin' Bender.

21:32.117 --> 21:34.386
- How are you, man?
- Well, I'd be lying

21:34.520 --> 21:37.456
if I said everything was
rainbows and unicorns.

21:37.589 --> 21:38.990
You're still struggling, huh?

21:39.124 --> 21:41.293
Yeah, I've been
eating shit, actually.

21:41.427 --> 21:44.829
Went through my mom's inheritance,
and, uh, now I'm living in my van.

21:44.962 --> 21:46.632
So, you know, fuck me.

21:46.765 --> 21:49.934
I don't want to talk about it.
Know what I want to talk about?

21:50.069 --> 21:52.204
I want to talk
about Buddy Games.

21:52.338 --> 21:55.374
- Uh, what about Buddy Games?
- I heard through the grapevine

21:55.507 --> 21:59.144
not only are they back on,
but Shelly's back?

21:59.278 --> 22:01.513
Where the fuck has he been,
and why didn't you call me?

22:01.647 --> 22:04.583
- Uh, listen...
- I want to know when and where they are.

22:04.717 --> 22:05.983
I need to sleep
on your couch.

22:06.118 --> 22:08.654
I'll take a bed.
I'll take whatever.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.389
But I need some sleep.

22:11.190 --> 22:15.494
Uh... there's an
entry fee this year.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.994
Okay, yeah. All right.

22:17.129 --> 22:19.931
Like, how much?
Like, ten bucks?

22:21.834 --> 22:24.303
$10,000? Our friends
that I've known...

22:24.436 --> 22:26.338
we've known forever...
they now all of a sudden

22:26.472 --> 22:29.974
have $10,000 in side cash
they can just throw around?

22:30.109 --> 22:32.211
Durfy does?
He still owes me 20 bucks.

22:32.344 --> 22:34.179
- That's what the guys wanted to do. I'm sorry.
- Fine.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.548
We'll play your
high-stakes shit, okay?

22:36.682 --> 22:40.085
But I want to play,
so can you front me the money?

22:40.219 --> 22:42.154
No. Things are, uh,
a little tight

22:42.287 --> 22:43.856
at the moment,
so I can't.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.791
Yeah, I can tell.
You're roughing it.

22:45.923 --> 22:49.261
Just let me play. You can.
You can because you're the Bobfather.

22:49.395 --> 22:52.164
So you created this world.
You make the rules.

22:52.297 --> 22:54.932
So you could go, "Hey,
remember our friend Bender?

22:55.067 --> 22:57.136
Can he come and play?"

22:58.570 --> 23:01.840
I can't.
Just figured it out. Shelly.

23:01.973 --> 23:03.742
Now this makes sense.
Holy shit.

23:03.876 --> 23:05.644
Because five years ago,

23:05.778 --> 23:07.679
I accidentally
cracked his nut.

23:07.813 --> 23:10.048
- I'm really sorry, okay?
- He lost both of his balls.

23:10.182 --> 23:13.352
- He lost both his fucking balls.
- What?

23:13.485 --> 23:14.919
Goddamn you, man!

23:15.053 --> 23:16.488
Both of them?

23:17.890 --> 23:20.024
- I don't want to talk about it. You got to go.
- Bob, I didn't know.

23:20.159 --> 23:21.560
- You got to go.
- All right, all right.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.163
I love you, dude,
but you gotta fucking go.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.012
You're leaving right now?

23:41.146 --> 23:42.714
Where are you going?

23:45.050 --> 23:47.853
Really? Really, Bob?

23:47.985 --> 23:51.857
You can't float me
any cash? Really?

23:51.989 --> 23:54.326
Damn it, man! Come on!

23:54.460 --> 23:56.161
What a dick!

24:05.504 --> 24:08.040
All right,
I'll tell you what.

24:08.173 --> 24:10.876
I'll give you 25 for
the china, 50 for the ring,

24:11.008 --> 24:14.112
- Fifty?
- A hundred for the locket, a hundred for the paintings,

24:14.246 --> 24:17.516
and, uh, $100 for
the rest of this crap.

24:17.649 --> 24:20.319
- 375. We got a deal?
- What? No, we don't have a deal.

24:20.452 --> 24:24.056
$50 for a diamond?
That was my mother's wedding ring.

24:24.189 --> 24:26.291
It's fake, fella.

24:26.425 --> 24:27.860
What?

24:27.992 --> 24:30.662
Fuckin' motherfucker!

24:30.796 --> 24:33.031
She gave him 47 years.

24:33.165 --> 24:35.033
That should be
a Purple Heart!

24:35.167 --> 24:36.869
That would actually
be worth something.

24:37.001 --> 24:38.370
Fine. Okay.

24:38.504 --> 24:40.739
All right, fine.
What about the china?

24:40.873 --> 24:43.242
You can't tell me that's fake.
'Cause that says,

24:43.375 --> 24:45.511
"Made in China."
Okay.

24:45.644 --> 24:47.679
So I will take no less

24:47.813 --> 24:50.716
than a thousand for all this,
and that's final.

24:50.849 --> 24:52.651
I'll tell you what.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.586
I'll give you 375.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.123
She's still dead.

24:59.191 --> 25:01.393
500. $500.

25:01.527 --> 25:02.661
Okay.

25:03.362 --> 25:05.163
I don't normally
do this...

25:06.164 --> 25:07.499
but I'm gonna
give you 375.

25:07.633 --> 25:11.370
Oh, you're really
having fun, aren't you?

25:14.506 --> 25:16.675
Can I hold the locket
one more time?

25:17.442 --> 25:19.711
Can you give me that,
you surly fuck?

25:23.248 --> 25:25.617
- Can I keep the picture?
- Sure.

25:25.751 --> 25:28.120
That'll be $5.

25:32.157 --> 25:34.192
Hey!

25:34.326 --> 25:36.828
- Asshole!
- Sorry. I'm in training.

25:36.962 --> 25:39.197
We're gonna test your range of
motion, all right?

25:39.331 --> 25:41.500
I want you to hold on
to this ball here,

25:41.633 --> 25:44.136
and you're gonna go
from side to side.

25:44.269 --> 25:46.705
Oh! He steals the ball!

25:46.838 --> 25:48.874
Oh!

25:49.007 --> 25:51.843
Mr. Hornbacher,
I am so sorry.

25:53.078 --> 25:55.747
Yeah, some lemonade, please.

25:57.549 --> 25:59.117
Thank you.

25:59.918 --> 26:02.220
Thank you.

26:12.497 --> 26:15.367
Hey, what do we have here?

26:15.500 --> 26:18.037
Saddle up,
you old grisly bird.

26:18.170 --> 26:21.006
Yeah.

26:21.139 --> 26:22.808
Yeah, beauty.

26:22.941 --> 26:24.576
Cheers.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.712
You're breaking
the law, mister!

26:26.845 --> 26:30.749
You need a liquor
license to sell vodka.

26:30.882 --> 26:34.252
And you need to recognize
a business opportunity.

26:34.386 --> 26:37.556
So MYOB, little bitches!

26:37.689 --> 26:40.692
- He just said the "B" word!
- Shame on you!

26:40.826 --> 26:42.461
You're both gonna be strippers
when you grow up,

26:42.594 --> 26:44.863
really bad ones
that no one pays to see.

26:44.997 --> 26:46.131
Ew!

26:46.264 --> 26:48.800
I'm texting the police!

26:48.934 --> 26:50.435
Fuck.

26:53.605 --> 26:55.374
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Stop!

26:55.507 --> 26:57.609
Hey, come back here!

26:57.743 --> 26:59.144
Get on the pole!

26:59.277 --> 27:00.679
What are you doing?
Stop!

27:00.812 --> 27:04.349
- Give us our money! Come back!
- You're bad kids!

27:07.019 --> 27:09.855
- He took our money!
- Stop! Hey!

27:12.058 --> 27:13.092
Pig!

27:13.225 --> 27:14.793
Mom!

27:17.863 --> 27:19.698
She didn't tell me.

27:19.831 --> 27:22.401
I thought I had cancer,
damn it. Okay.

27:22.534 --> 27:24.336
I thought I had cancer,
damn it.

27:24.469 --> 27:27.572
You all knew what I was,
and you didn't tell me?

27:27.706 --> 27:30.542
I thought I had cancer,
damn it!

27:32.045 --> 27:33.679
Hmm.

27:34.312 --> 27:35.781
Fuck.

27:37.649 --> 27:39.885
What the fuck.
Was that any good?

27:44.523 --> 27:46.324
- Yeah.
- Hey, little brother.

27:46.458 --> 27:47.993
Little busy today.
What do you need?

27:48.127 --> 27:50.529
I need to borrow
a couple bucks.

27:51.563 --> 27:53.465
Thought you said this
Hollywood thing was working out.

27:53.598 --> 27:56.334
It is. I just
murdered an audition

27:56.468 --> 27:58.637
for a CW pilot
right before I called you.

27:58.770 --> 28:01.540
<i>And I'm in postproduction
on something right now.</i>

28:01.673 --> 28:02.941
What the fuck
is postproduction?

28:03.076 --> 28:06.611
I star in a national commercial
for the Marines.

28:06.745 --> 28:08.680
Well, I'm sure Dad
would have been proud.

28:08.814 --> 28:10.716
He'd have been more proud if you
were an actual fucking Marine.

28:10.849 --> 28:13.585
Jack, you are hurting my
feelings a little bit, but yes.

28:13.719 --> 28:16.655
Jesus Christ. Listen to me.
Do you know how hard it is

28:16.788 --> 28:18.757
trying to keep this
family business profitable

28:18.890 --> 28:21.094
without having to finance
your little pipe dreams?

28:21.226 --> 28:22.794
Dad left this to you,
not me.

28:22.928 --> 28:25.330
<i>How long's it gonna be
before you figure out</i>

28:25.464 --> 28:28.366
that this acting thing
is a fucking waste of time?

28:28.500 --> 28:33.039
You know, sister's out here.
Belly's as big as shit,

28:33.172 --> 28:34.973
but she's sweating her balls
off just like the rest of us.

28:35.108 --> 28:37.409
So why don't you think about
that while you're out there

28:37.542 --> 28:39.978
in La-La Land eating your
goddamn avocado sandwiches?

28:40.113 --> 28:42.781
- <i>You don't know what I...</i>
- I got work to do. Real work.

28:42.914 --> 28:45.417
Look it up. Fuck-head.

29:00.866 --> 29:03.035
Full penetration's
an extra hundred.

29:03.169 --> 29:05.470
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
Uh-huh!

29:05.604 --> 29:07.572
I'm giving you
the early-bird special.

29:07.706 --> 29:10.008
Shut up and dig! Dig, boy!

29:11.576 --> 29:13.311
How many labias
do you have?

29:13.445 --> 29:16.149
Oh, I just farted!
Just keep going!

29:16.281 --> 29:17.983
Oh, it's bad!

29:22.188 --> 29:23.855
Oh, no!

29:23.989 --> 29:28.326
No!

29:39.038 --> 29:40.806
Looking great, hon.

29:40.939 --> 29:43.642
- Yeah?
- Gorgeous.

29:43.775 --> 29:45.577
Come on, angel.
Time to go.

29:47.280 --> 29:51.316
Hey, honey, it's me,
checking in again.

29:52.584 --> 29:54.853
I just want to make sure
that you're okay out there,

29:54.986 --> 29:56.788
<i>wherever you are.</i>

29:56.922 --> 29:59.391
<i>I just want to know why
you stormed off like that,</i>

29:59.524 --> 30:01.960
<i>why you hate these guys
so much.</i>

30:02.094 --> 30:03.695
<i>Look, we need to talk.</i>

30:40.599 --> 30:42.834
Oh, here we are.

30:46.072 --> 30:47.873
Okay.

30:48.006 --> 30:50.408
Oh, wow.

30:50.542 --> 30:53.678
Oh, I bet this brings back
some fond memories, huh?

30:54.913 --> 30:57.916
Last time I was here,
I was getting wheeled out on a stretcher.

30:58.683 --> 31:00.219
Well,
not that memory.

31:00.353 --> 31:03.588
- Welcome back, buddy!
- Oh, hey.

31:03.722 --> 31:05.523
- You made it.
- Yeah.

31:05.657 --> 31:07.525
Hey, I got to defend
my title, right?

31:07.659 --> 31:09.195
- I'm gonna take that back.
- Hey! Hey!

31:09.328 --> 31:12.864
Oh, talking smack already.
How much fun is this, huh?

31:12.998 --> 31:16.302
- All right, Mama.
- Okay, I'll let you boys be.

31:16.434 --> 31:18.337
- Come on.
- Hold that for a second.

31:18.470 --> 31:22.208
Just a second. You only hold
it while I get out of the car.

31:22.341 --> 31:24.377
Good luck, sweetie.

31:24.509 --> 31:26.212
- So good to see you.
- Give 'em hell, hon.

31:26.345 --> 31:27.812
- Bye, Mom. Thanks.
- Bye, Mary Ann.

31:27.946 --> 31:29.714
- Thanks.
- Bye, Mama. Thank you.

31:29.848 --> 31:33.352
- Welcome back, man.
- The place hasn't changed much.

31:33.485 --> 31:35.087
Yeah. Yeah.

31:36.488 --> 31:38.090
Hey, there's, uh...

31:39.325 --> 31:42.527
There's something that I wasn't
entirely honest with you about.

31:42.661 --> 31:45.997
- My company did well.
- How well?

31:46.132 --> 31:50.936
Well, I sold it for...
approximately 387 million.

31:51.070 --> 31:52.671
Wow! That's...

31:52.804 --> 31:55.408
- I'm... Holy...
- Yeah, it's been a...

31:55.540 --> 31:58.643
- Congratulations, brother.
- ...a pretty good couple of years, thanks.

31:59.577 --> 32:01.546
Life just hasn't been
the same without you.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.682
That part was true.

32:04.883 --> 32:07.420
You didn't tell
the guys about my...

32:07.552 --> 32:10.189
Your balls? No. No.
Definitely not.

32:11.489 --> 32:13.326
I'm not sure I can
believe you now, Bob.

32:13.458 --> 32:15.061
Yeah? Well, believe this.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.629
- You're with friends now.
- Hey, boobs!

32:17.762 --> 32:20.899
- Is that your dad?
- Hey, Mr. Schmidt.

32:21.033 --> 32:23.135
No, no, no.
That's... That's Shelly.

32:23.969 --> 32:26.105
Oh, my God.
What the hell?

32:26.238 --> 32:28.540
Holy shit, Sheldon!

32:28.673 --> 32:31.243
- Fuck you guys.
- Are you kidding me?

32:31.377 --> 32:33.212
He's back!

32:33.346 --> 32:35.381
Get the fuck off of me.

32:35.513 --> 32:37.816
Get off of me.
Get off of me.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.952
Hands off, hands off.

32:41.087 --> 32:43.055
That's right.

32:45.458 --> 32:46.958
Oh, so, um,

32:47.093 --> 32:49.362
I had to say goodbye
to the guys in Bon Jovi

32:49.494 --> 32:53.032
and start the journey
home, man.

32:53.165 --> 32:55.700
I just realized I couldn't
run from it anymore.

32:55.834 --> 32:58.037
That's reality.
That's it.

32:58.170 --> 33:01.273
You still got his
number, Bon Jovi?

33:03.675 --> 33:05.111
Come on, Doc. Some decorum.

33:05.244 --> 33:08.381
Shel, I'm so sorry you had
to go through all that, man.

33:08.546 --> 33:09.781
Thanks.

33:09.914 --> 33:11.816
But tell me about
the chicks from Tibet, man.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.885
'Cause I've heard they're
smoking hot. True or false?

33:14.019 --> 33:15.754
- Nah, I never heard that.
- I never heard that.

33:15.887 --> 33:17.356
You guys haven't heard...

33:17.490 --> 33:19.624
The point is that our king is back.
Look at this.

33:19.758 --> 33:22.061
He sure as hell is.

33:22.194 --> 33:24.296
Let's make a toast.
Oh, wait. Somebody's here.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.299
- Nut check!
- Oh!

33:27.433 --> 33:29.834
Oh! Oh!

33:29.968 --> 33:33.705
Nut tap! You're lucky they were low.
I didn't really feel much.

33:33.838 --> 33:37.809
You dodged a bullet.
I just felt log.

33:37.942 --> 33:40.246
I'm very happy to see
we're still doing that.

33:40.379 --> 33:42.148
No shit,
because that is...

33:42.281 --> 33:44.983
That's the kind of stuff I
missed, man, all my travels.

33:45.117 --> 33:47.886
It was the camaraderie,
being with you guys, just...

33:48.019 --> 33:50.256
the connection with other
people, you know?

33:50.389 --> 33:52.724
I feel bad I didn't reach
back out to you guys.

33:52.857 --> 33:56.761
'Cause I got all the cards and the notes and
everything. I just had a lot on my mind.

33:56.895 --> 33:59.331
- It just wasn't...
- You kidding? We love you, man.

33:59.465 --> 34:01.233
What...

34:05.271 --> 34:07.139
I know that horn. Yeah.

34:07.273 --> 34:08.606
It's got to be.

34:08.740 --> 34:10.842
Whoo! What?

34:11.510 --> 34:13.878
What? Buddy Games!

34:14.012 --> 34:16.082
Yeah!

34:16.215 --> 34:19.385
- There he is!
- Hey, you guys, Bender's here!

34:19.518 --> 34:21.586
You fucking bastard.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.855
He's not supposed
to be here.

34:23.988 --> 34:25.790
Come on. I'm not gonna
miss the Buddy Games.

34:25.924 --> 34:27.359
That's insane.
What's up, Durf?

34:27.493 --> 34:29.161
Bender!

34:29.295 --> 34:32.131
- Who's that guy?
- Hey, man. How are ya?

34:33.165 --> 34:34.266
Are you lost?

34:34.400 --> 34:36.102
Sheldon.
What's up, bud?

34:36.235 --> 34:38.370
I got nothing to say
to you, buddy.

34:38.504 --> 34:40.506
You got a lot of fucking nerve
showing your face here.

34:40.638 --> 34:43.675
I knew you were gonna say
that, and I'm here for peace.

34:43.808 --> 34:45.810
Okay? Hear me out.

34:49.081 --> 34:51.649
Look, man, the past
is in the past, dude.

34:51.783 --> 34:54.652
There's nothing we can do about it.
What happened, happened.

34:54.786 --> 34:57.089
All I care about
is the future

34:57.223 --> 34:59.158
and our prosperity,

34:59.291 --> 35:01.025
and that's why I'm here.

35:01.659 --> 35:03.995
Sheldon, I give you...

35:04.130 --> 35:07.632
- Cuban cigars.
- No, Doc, but good guess.

35:07.765 --> 35:10.402
This is something
a little bit more special.

35:19.211 --> 35:20.146
What is this?

35:20.279 --> 35:21.679
It's my... my seed.

35:21.813 --> 35:24.816
My... baby sauce.

35:24.949 --> 35:27.052
- What?
- Dick matter.

35:34.460 --> 35:37.630
- Are you... Are you for real?
- Wow, Dixon fucking Bender.

35:37.762 --> 35:39.764
Oh, that's a lot of loads.

35:39.898 --> 35:41.400
Uh, it's nine,
to be exact.

35:41.534 --> 35:42.700
Whoa, there.

35:42.834 --> 35:44.570
- Dude, two days, that took me.
- Ugh.

35:44.702 --> 35:47.473
Bender, you are
a fucking hero, man.

35:48.474 --> 35:50.509
- That's kind of weird, man.
- Was there a memo?

35:50.643 --> 35:52.710
Were we supposed to bring semen?
I didn't bring semen. Durfy?

35:52.844 --> 35:56.182
Bender, that's a very gross present.
Why did you give him that?

35:56.315 --> 35:59.084
It's not gross.
It's not gross, okay?

35:59.218 --> 36:02.354
Our friend, our very good
friend here, Sheldon,

36:02.488 --> 36:05.757
he lost both of his testicles.

36:06.458 --> 36:07.692
Oh...

36:08.793 --> 36:10.095
Is that true, Shelly?

36:13.731 --> 36:15.867
It's true. I, uh...
They're both gone.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.505
I'm... I'm, uh... I'm like
a Ken doll down there now.

36:19.638 --> 36:21.873
Hey, Ken had a good life.

36:22.006 --> 36:26.078
He had a hot blonde,
a Corvette. Right?

36:27.112 --> 36:29.582
Ah, look, I mean,
I can't complain.

36:29.714 --> 36:32.016
- Now I can have kids.
- You can have dozens.

36:32.151 --> 36:35.054
So, that's
my peace offering,

36:35.187 --> 36:39.091
and I just want to know,
are we cool?

36:42.194 --> 36:44.463
Yeah. Yeah.

36:44.597 --> 36:46.165
All right. Whew!

36:46.298 --> 36:47.765
- Oh, thank God.
- Are you kidding me?

36:47.899 --> 36:49.301
- Come on.
- Love you, brother.

36:49.435 --> 36:51.303
It worked. Thought we
were gonna see some blows.

36:51.437 --> 36:53.871
Thank you very much.
That's really fucking awesome.

36:54.005 --> 36:56.108
I love that. Know what
else I love? Alcohol!

36:56.242 --> 36:57.710
Let's go to the tiki bar.
Come on.

36:57.842 --> 36:59.712
- Tiki bar!
- All right.

36:59.844 --> 37:01.080
Go for it.

37:01.980 --> 37:04.049
- I can't believe that worked...
- Thanks, Bob.

37:04.183 --> 37:06.185
'Cause that's
your fault, right?

37:07.152 --> 37:08.721
- Whoa!
- What the hell?

37:08.853 --> 37:11.557
Dude, what is all this money?
What is that?

37:11.690 --> 37:13.958
Dude,
it was not easy.

37:14.093 --> 37:16.595
I mean, a $10,000
entry fee?

37:16.729 --> 37:18.397
That was not easy
to scrape up,

37:18.530 --> 37:20.865
but I banged and bartered
my way for those Benjamins.

37:20.999 --> 37:23.569
Pretty much sold my soul,
and, uh, don't give a shit.

37:23.702 --> 37:25.870
But at the end of the
day, I'm gonna win that...

37:26.004 --> 37:28.540
<i>♪ $60,000, whores ♪</i>

37:28.674 --> 37:30.709
Entry fee?
What entry fee?

37:30.842 --> 37:33.045
- I'm lost.
- Bender...

37:34.012 --> 37:36.482
I'm sorry, Bender.
There was never an entry fee.

37:36.615 --> 37:38.450
What?

37:38.584 --> 37:43.021
I'm sorry, but I didn't have the heart
to tell you, man, you weren't invited.

37:43.155 --> 37:45.324
We didn't feel comfortable
with you here this year.

37:45.457 --> 37:48.627
You know, you could've told me that.
That would have been a lot easier.

37:48.761 --> 37:50.396
I didn't think you were gonna
come up with ten thou...

37:50.529 --> 37:53.399
I mean, 10,000 bucks?
Really? That's crazy!

37:53.532 --> 37:55.234
- Oh, my God.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

37:55.367 --> 37:58.270
I made up everything about
the fee and the pot. I'm sorry.

37:58.404 --> 38:02.074
You're sorry? I sold
all of my shit! All of it!

38:02.207 --> 38:04.076
I sold all
my mom's stuff.

38:04.209 --> 38:07.246
I gave a bum
a hand job for $30.

38:07.379 --> 38:10.182
- Ooh, expand on that.
- No, I'm not going to. You want to smell my hand?

38:10.316 --> 38:12.618
I don't think so.
No, probably not.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.320
Bob, you fucked me, man!

38:14.453 --> 38:16.722
You promised me 60 grand,
so you better fix this.

38:16.854 --> 38:19.792
I can't get that stuff back.
I can't take that hand job back.

38:19.924 --> 38:23.128
This has always been about pride. You said
it yourself. This is about the brotherhood.

38:23.262 --> 38:24.962
This is not about money
or anything else.

38:25.097 --> 38:26.432
Oh, fuck that!

38:26.565 --> 38:28.534
Yeah, it's not about money,
because you have money.

38:28.667 --> 38:30.602
- All right? Zane.
- Yeah?

38:30.736 --> 38:33.405
Could you use $60,000
for your tanning business?

38:33.539 --> 38:35.574
- Yes.
- Yeah.

38:35.708 --> 38:38.043
- Durf, what about you, bud?
- Yeah.

38:38.177 --> 38:41.380
- It's a hard yes from you. It should be. Doc?
- Yeah.

38:41.513 --> 38:44.316
Exactly. And Shelly needs new
straitjackets. You see, Bob?

38:44.450 --> 38:47.086
We all fucking need.

38:47.219 --> 38:51.423
But not you, man.
You don't have the need for anything.

38:55.993 --> 38:58.397
Zane, could I spot you
10,000 bucks?

38:58.530 --> 39:00.366
- Just this once.
- What about you, Durfy? Can I spot you?

39:00.499 --> 39:03.602
- What about you? Doc? Shelly?
- Yeah, I won't say no.

39:03.736 --> 39:05.170
50,000 bucks.

39:05.304 --> 39:07.272
- That's great. What about you?
- What about me?

39:07.406 --> 39:09.208
What are you gonna
spot yourself?

39:09.941 --> 39:11.477
Can you believe
this fucking guy?

39:11.610 --> 39:12.644
Well, yeah.

39:12.778 --> 39:14.847
It's so crazy!
I sold all my shit.

39:15.848 --> 39:18.217
I'm gonna match the fucking pot.
How does that sound?

39:18.350 --> 39:20.853
Hundred thousand bucks!

39:20.985 --> 39:22.287
We're gonna play
for 100,000 bucks.

39:22.421 --> 39:24.623
I like it,
I don't love it.

39:24.757 --> 39:26.023
- One-fifty.
- Yes! Done.

39:26.158 --> 39:29.094
- 150,000 bucks!
- 150 grand!

39:29.228 --> 39:33.165
- Oh!
- Looks like we got ourselves a Buddy Game.

39:34.233 --> 39:35.334
Yes!

39:41.607 --> 39:44.008
All right,
boys, here we go!

39:44.143 --> 39:45.844
The Buddy Games
are back, baby!

39:47.746 --> 39:50.749
Kicking off this year's event:
Kong's Crucible.

39:50.883 --> 39:52.518
It's a giant
obstacle course,

39:52.651 --> 39:54.853
complete with corn dogs,
bubble balls,

39:54.986 --> 39:57.189
watermelons,
electric eels.

39:57.322 --> 39:59.425
- What's that?
- Don't ask.

39:59.558 --> 40:01.827
Once you get through there,
it's mud pits,

40:01.959 --> 40:03.629
motorcycles, beer bongs,

40:03.762 --> 40:06.732
and one
big-ass waterslide.

40:06.865 --> 40:09.835
You're gonna catch a lot of air,
I'm gonna warn you right now,

40:09.967 --> 40:11.236
but, very important
to note,

40:11.370 --> 40:13.405
the only way you win
is if you capture the flag.

40:13.539 --> 40:16.007
Whoever captures the flag
wins the event.

40:16.141 --> 40:18.410
Top three finalists
at the end of today's events

40:18.544 --> 40:21.313
competes in tomorrow's
final event, the endgame.

40:21.447 --> 40:23.682
Oh, by the way, Shelly,
we got near beer for you.

40:23.816 --> 40:25.651
- Copy.
- Wait, what?

40:25.784 --> 40:28.687
- He's in the program, Bender.
- I can't mix my meds with alcohol.

40:28.821 --> 40:30.155
He can't drink alcohol period.

40:30.289 --> 40:31.890
That seems like
an unfair advantage.

40:32.023 --> 40:34.860
- It's still beer, dick face!
- Why don't you just get him a Fresca.

40:34.992 --> 40:38.530
Are you trying to mind-fuck me, <i>mijo?</i>
'Cause I invented mind-fucking.

40:38.664 --> 40:41.200
- I'll come all over your mind.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:41.333 --> 40:43.202
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

40:43.335 --> 40:45.237
Insane Clown Pussy.

40:45.370 --> 40:47.639
Are you ready for this?

40:48.340 --> 40:50.007
- Boom!
- Eat!

41:15.234 --> 41:17.102
Goddamn, dude!

41:21.106 --> 41:23.208
What the fuck?

42:11.223 --> 42:13.725
High voltage? What...

42:20.465 --> 42:23.702
- Oh! Oh, God!
- Get over here!

42:47.125 --> 42:48.827
Go, go, go, go!

43:03.308 --> 43:06.445
Fuck you!
Eat it! Eat it!

43:13.052 --> 43:14.620
Coming for you!

43:14.753 --> 43:16.089
Come on!

43:16.221 --> 43:18.023
I can suck way harder
than you, Bender!

43:18.156 --> 43:20.158
Let's get it!

43:23.862 --> 43:25.397
Fuck it.

43:34.740 --> 43:35.874
Ah, good!

43:36.008 --> 43:37.509
Cheaters!

43:39.177 --> 43:41.313
Not today!

43:42.414 --> 43:44.916
Don't touch me, Bender! Aaah!

43:48.121 --> 43:51.823
I am Kong King!

43:57.030 --> 43:58.897
Stop Shelly!

44:06.938 --> 44:08.373
Oh, no! Oh, no!

44:08.507 --> 44:11.376
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

44:15.280 --> 44:17.215
Son of a bitch!

44:52.185 --> 44:53.719
You finished?

44:53.852 --> 44:56.089
Bob put zero effort
into this event.

44:56.221 --> 44:57.556
This is
fucking dumb.

44:57.689 --> 44:59.791
Oh, come on.
I lost my whole lure.

45:04.229 --> 45:05.931
Is there money in there?

45:06.065 --> 45:07.999
- Open it.
- Be careful, Doc.

45:13.106 --> 45:14.673
Yeah!

45:15.741 --> 45:17.876
Oh, no!

45:20.046 --> 45:22.781
- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
- Oh, God!

45:43.169 --> 45:44.436
Yeah, baby.

45:44.569 --> 45:46.105
Okay.
Remember them well.

45:46.239 --> 45:48.540
All right, here we are, boys...
the old watering hole.

45:48.673 --> 45:50.809
The old Spread Eagle
Bar and Grill.

45:52.644 --> 45:54.913
It's also the home
of our next challenge.

45:55.047 --> 45:56.848
So full
of curveballs.

45:56.982 --> 45:58.416
Who here thinks
they got what it takes

45:58.550 --> 45:59.885
when it comes to
charming the ladies?

46:01.653 --> 46:02.921
Well, that's part of it.

46:03.055 --> 46:04.956
You think you can get
a girl to buy you a drink?

46:05.091 --> 46:06.758
Okay, easy enough.

46:06.892 --> 46:08.994
Take them on the dance floor and
maybe get a kiss on the lips?

46:09.128 --> 46:11.230
- Oh, please.
- Bob, come on.

46:11.363 --> 46:13.431
Okay, well,
who can do that

46:13.565 --> 46:16.001
without shitting
your pants first?

46:18.204 --> 46:20.106
Yeah, you all got real serious
now, didn't you?

46:20.239 --> 46:22.340
- Bob, that's perverse.
- Nope, that's the next challenge.

46:22.474 --> 46:24.342
I like to call it
"intestinal fortitude."

46:24.476 --> 46:27.312
Man, this is the dumbest shit ever.
Are you fucking kidding me?

46:27.445 --> 46:29.148
- No.
- Corn dogs and laxatives?

46:29.282 --> 46:31.650
You are the ones that wanted
to play for 150,000 bucks.

46:31.783 --> 46:33.351
I'm just trying to
make you earn it.

46:33.485 --> 46:35.420
Sounds like somebody
doesn't want to compete.

46:35.554 --> 46:38.023
- And if you don't compete...
- You must concede.

46:38.157 --> 46:41.993
I'm not conceding! I'm a fucking
cock rooster. Gonna get me a chicken.

46:42.128 --> 46:44.629
- Here we go.
- Oh, man.

47:04.250 --> 47:05.684
Oh, my God.

47:06.918 --> 47:09.621
- Your bag is everything.
- Oh, thank you.

47:09.754 --> 47:12.058
- I'm sorry. May I?
- Absolutely.

47:12.191 --> 47:13.892
- Look at that.
- It's watermelon.

47:14.025 --> 47:16.195
I think I might be the last
piece to this puzzle.

47:16.329 --> 47:18.264
Oh!

47:20.066 --> 47:21.633
My mouth is very dry.

47:21.766 --> 47:24.337
- Can I get you a drink?
- You are so very sweet.

47:24.469 --> 47:26.438
- Absolutely.
- I... Just this once.

47:26.571 --> 47:29.308
- Okay. What do you like?
- Oh, anything that's wet.

47:29.441 --> 47:30.475
- Oh...
- Oh!

47:30.609 --> 47:32.510
Hey, can you buy me a drink?

47:32.644 --> 47:34.113
I live in my van.

47:34.247 --> 47:35.714
What? No.

47:36.648 --> 47:38.483
I'll chow your box
for a week.

47:38.617 --> 47:40.418
You like vodka?

47:40.552 --> 47:43.021
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:43.155 --> 47:44.522
Two wet ones.

47:44.656 --> 47:46.758
Yeah, hi.
This is Dr. Kelly.

47:53.565 --> 47:56.102
You look like
you need a blow job.

47:58.304 --> 48:00.039
- Shot, silly.
- Oh.

48:00.172 --> 48:01.240
What did you think
I meant?

48:01.374 --> 48:03.541
Uh, you know, oral...

48:04.910 --> 48:07.946
Can you please just call me back?
I miss you.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.215
All right, bye.

48:09.348 --> 48:12.817
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

48:13.752 --> 48:15.754
I would buy you a drink...

48:16.755 --> 48:19.658
but my friends and I are playing
this ridiculous game

48:19.791 --> 48:22.128
where we're trying to get
women to buy us drinks.

48:22.261 --> 48:24.096
That's refreshingly
honest.

48:24.230 --> 48:27.999
- It's ridiculous.
- I feel like buying you a drink.

48:28.134 --> 48:30.669
- Okay.
- What'll it be?

48:31.270 --> 48:33.538
Uh-oh. You look lonely.

48:33.672 --> 48:37.176
The cure for that is,
you buy me a drink,

48:37.310 --> 48:38.677
and I'll sit...

48:39.477 --> 48:41.147
I'll save
this seat for you.

48:41.947 --> 48:43.648
You know what drinking
makes me want to do?

48:43.782 --> 48:46.918
- What's that?
- It makes me want to feel, and it makes me want to move.

48:47.053 --> 48:49.454
- You want to move with me?
- Ooh, absolutely!

48:49.587 --> 48:52.158
Oh, I know you.
Hi, Durf.

48:54.659 --> 48:56.995
Here we go. Here it is.

48:57.129 --> 48:58.964
There's a kink there
that's very sensitive

48:59.098 --> 49:00.832
- on the right side, yeah.
- Oh, I can feel that.

49:00.966 --> 49:02.567
Why don't you order us
a couple drinks,

49:02.701 --> 49:04.502
and I'll get you
all fixed up?

49:04.636 --> 49:06.571
Um, sure.

49:06.705 --> 49:09.141
Eddie,
two vodka cranberry.

49:09.275 --> 49:11.077
Careful.
I'm very sensitive.

49:11.210 --> 49:14.246
Nice and loosey-goosey.
Nice and loosey-goosey.

49:14.380 --> 49:15.714
Aaah!

49:15.847 --> 49:17.716
- Oh, yeah, there you go.
- Oh, God!

49:17.849 --> 49:21.387
- How's that? Nice?
- I think you just made it worse.

49:21.519 --> 49:25.091
- Stand up. Let's check that weight distribution.
- Okay, hang on.

49:25.224 --> 49:28.760
- I love your hair. Do you sleep in the woods?
- Sometimes.

49:28.893 --> 49:31.397
I got a half a bottle
of Fireball parked outside

49:31.529 --> 49:34.599
in my Kia Sorento,
if you're interested in coming out back.

49:35.234 --> 49:36.435
Yes. Yes, I am.

49:36.568 --> 49:37.802
- Yes, I am.
- Good.

49:37.936 --> 49:41.506
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Save it, kitty. Save it.

49:41.639 --> 49:44.909
Let's hit the dance floor,
and you can ride me like a fucking animal.

49:45.044 --> 49:47.979
I will. I will.
Okay, let's go.

49:57.822 --> 50:00.525
If you let
your hips go,

50:00.658 --> 50:02.560
your neck will follow.

50:02.694 --> 50:04.963
Wait a minute.
Are you trying to dance with me?

50:05.097 --> 50:07.066
Yeah. No, I'm...

50:08.633 --> 50:11.270
Oh, no.

50:11.404 --> 50:12.937
Oh, no!

50:13.571 --> 50:15.207
Where's the bathroom?

50:15.341 --> 50:17.243
That's it for Doc.

50:20.912 --> 50:22.814
- I don't want to buy you a drink.
- What's the big deal?

50:22.947 --> 50:25.317
- Fuck off, please.
- What did you say to me?

50:25.451 --> 50:28.953
- I said, "Walk off."
- Hey! The lady said no, asshole.

50:29.088 --> 50:32.924
- Fuck off, shrimp dick. Come on. Please.
- No!

50:34.460 --> 50:36.128
Hey, bud,
how's it going?

50:36.262 --> 50:38.364
How does it look
like it's going, bitch?

50:38.497 --> 50:39.898
Okay.

50:40.032 --> 50:42.201
Zane, I forgot what a good
dancer you are, man.

50:42.334 --> 50:44.969
- Yeah?
- What was that move you used to do back in the day?

50:45.104 --> 50:47.139
It was sick.
You used to kill it.

50:47.273 --> 50:51.410
It's not a move, Bender.
It's called art.

50:51.544 --> 50:53.812
- Hey, dude, break it out, man.
- Yeah?

50:53.945 --> 50:54.946
Yeah.

50:55.081 --> 50:58.050
- Here at the Spread Eagle?
- Yeah.

50:58.184 --> 50:59.918
Okay.

51:02.188 --> 51:04.256
Oh!

51:04.390 --> 51:07.226
Oh, Bender,
you made me...

51:07.359 --> 51:10.463
- Oh!
- What happened?

51:10.595 --> 51:13.099
I'm having a hard time
understanding what's she's doing.

51:13.232 --> 51:15.667
Why would she do that? She just left.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.902
She just left,
and... and I'm...

51:18.037 --> 51:21.273
I'm a little busted up about it.

51:21.407 --> 51:23.741
I mean, she's...
I love her.

51:23.875 --> 51:26.178
She is beautiful.
Tiff...

51:32.585 --> 51:34.120
You like that, huh?

51:34.253 --> 51:37.856
Who's the shrimp dick
now, huh?

51:37.989 --> 51:39.624
Let me go,
shrimp dick!

51:39.757 --> 51:41.327
What's up, Durf?

51:41.460 --> 51:43.362
Having some troubles?
Struggling a little bit?

51:43.496 --> 51:44.696
I'm good.

51:44.829 --> 51:45.897
You don't look good.

51:46.031 --> 51:47.399
Oh, fuck!

51:47.533 --> 51:49.135
Let it out!

51:51.537 --> 51:55.773
I'm gonna crush you,
you little Oompa Loompa motherfucker!

51:55.907 --> 51:59.478
Shh, shh. Go to sleep.
Shh, just let it happen.

51:59.612 --> 52:02.414
Shh.

52:02.548 --> 52:04.350
Shh.

52:05.117 --> 52:07.453
Yes! Yeah!

52:14.527 --> 52:16.828
Congratulations, Bender.

52:24.537 --> 52:25.837
Hey, Shelly.

52:25.970 --> 52:28.607
You looked pretty good
until the fight started.

52:28.740 --> 52:30.075
I don't want
to talk about it.

52:30.209 --> 52:32.144
- That guy was really small.
- Bender...

52:32.278 --> 52:35.013
I know they like to be called little
people, but I'd classify that guy...

52:35.147 --> 52:37.550
- Shut your cock pocket.
- What the fuck are we doing here?

52:37.715 --> 52:41.019
- Seriously, Bob. I have meat strapped to my face.
- Hold your horses, boys.

52:41.153 --> 52:43.755
It'll be here momentarily.
But first,

52:43.888 --> 52:46.791
I decided to throw a little
curveball into this one.

52:46.925 --> 52:49.662
- Oh!
- We're gonna hit this.

52:49.794 --> 52:52.097
- Oh, man.
- Oh, fuck, yes. Let's get weird.

52:52.231 --> 52:53.831
- Please!
- What does that mean?

52:53.965 --> 52:55.700
You're saying
you've never smoked pot?

52:55.833 --> 52:57.469
You don't fucking know
what I do

52:57.603 --> 52:58.803
when I go
to the clubs, man.

52:58.937 --> 53:00.939
I get super paranoid
when I smoke grass.

53:01.073 --> 53:03.042
Come on. You know the rules.
Buddy Games, baby.

53:03.175 --> 53:05.444
- If you can't compete, you must concede.
- It's medicinal.

53:05.578 --> 53:08.113
Bet I'm the only
one that's smoked hash.

53:08.247 --> 53:10.182
Guys, they test
sometimes on movie sets.

53:10.316 --> 53:11.916
I don't know if I can
have this in my system.

53:12.051 --> 53:13.918
That's the shit
that killed Hendrix.

53:14.053 --> 53:16.921
Yeah, boy!
Bye, bye, brain.

53:19.258 --> 53:20.725
Take it.

53:20.858 --> 53:22.261
- Got it?
- Got it.

53:23.229 --> 53:25.130
Don't bogart that shit.

53:26.632 --> 53:28.234
Fuck you.

53:31.537 --> 53:33.172
Holy shit.

53:33.305 --> 53:36.275
You're blowing it out and
sucking it in at the same time?

53:38.310 --> 53:40.878
- This is a bad idea.
- All right, boys.

53:41.012 --> 53:43.215
The final event
of the day.

53:44.015 --> 53:46.252
This is not a game
of strength

53:46.385 --> 53:48.387
or endurance,
but rather a test of courage,

53:48.520 --> 53:52.358
and it will determine tomorrow's
three finalists in the endgame.

53:52.491 --> 53:55.728
So ask yourselves, how bad
do you want that money, boys?

53:55.860 --> 53:57.895
- Bad. Real bad.
- Real bad.

53:58.030 --> 53:59.931
The game is simple.

54:00.065 --> 54:02.735
The last one to keep
his head above board wins.

54:02.867 --> 54:04.637
Enter the dragon!

54:04.769 --> 54:06.272
What?

54:09.441 --> 54:11.343
- Bob, what the fuck is that thing?
- What the fuck is that?

54:11.477 --> 54:14.213
- What the fuck is that, man.
- It's a dinosaur.

54:20.386 --> 54:23.088
Hey, Bob. Bob left.

54:23.222 --> 54:25.857
Bob, what
a fucking coward.

54:41.440 --> 54:44.743
Yeah. Look at Shelly
and his juicy, fat head.

54:44.876 --> 54:47.279
Eat off the rest
of his hair.

54:49.947 --> 54:51.116
Doc!

54:51.250 --> 54:53.218
- Oh, my God!
- Doc!

54:53.352 --> 54:56.288
- Tell me you're okay!
- That was intense.

54:56.422 --> 54:59.857
Doc, talk to me!
Doc, just talk!

54:59.991 --> 55:01.794
He senses fear!

55:01.926 --> 55:04.330
Doc was weak,
like you, Zane.

55:04.463 --> 55:05.863
Yeah.

55:10.235 --> 55:12.571
Yeah, I'm not afraid.

55:12.705 --> 55:14.906
Oh, no. Oh, God.

55:16.375 --> 55:18.444
No. No.

55:23.881 --> 55:27.018
Ugh! I'm sorry, Mom!

55:33.192 --> 55:36.395
That's it, motherfucker.
That's it, motherfucker.

55:36.528 --> 55:38.130
Huh?

55:38.263 --> 55:40.566
Shelly, get out of there.
You win, man.

55:40.699 --> 55:43.868
- What are you doing?
- You want a piece of me, huh?

55:44.001 --> 55:47.872
You stupid fucking pea-brained
lizard, you think I'm scared of you?

55:48.005 --> 55:49.675
Shelly, man, you already won.
Get out of there!

55:49.808 --> 55:52.144
Where is it?
Where is it? Come on!

55:52.277 --> 55:54.313
Oh, my God!

56:08.926 --> 56:10.162
Hey.

56:12.765 --> 56:13.799
You all right?

56:13.931 --> 56:16.201
Uh-huh. Good times, man.

56:16.335 --> 56:18.103
You're sort of gazing
right into that fire.

56:18.237 --> 56:21.507
I'm just a little
worried about you.

56:24.309 --> 56:26.445
Hey, look, I know you're
pissed at me right now...

56:26.578 --> 56:30.048
Why would I be pissed at you?
'Cause you lied to me about everything?

56:30.182 --> 56:33.085
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I am. But I did it for...

56:33.218 --> 56:35.220
Don't apologize.
You literally saved my life.

56:35.354 --> 56:38.257
- Well, I wouldn't go that far. I mean...
- No.

56:38.390 --> 56:41.059
This little reunion could just
as easily have been my funeral,

56:41.193 --> 56:44.196
but now I got a reason
to live again, man.

56:45.063 --> 56:47.932
And that? I owe that all
to you, little buddy.

56:51.203 --> 56:53.605
Can I get you anything?
Another near beer?

56:53.739 --> 56:55.307
Nah, I'm good.

56:55.441 --> 56:58.410
- Okay.
- You know what, though? I'm gonna get you something.

56:58.544 --> 57:01.380
- Okay.
- Show you how I feel about everything.

57:01.513 --> 57:03.682
- Ooh!
- Oh, yeah.

57:29.675 --> 57:33.111
- How many cards you want, Doc?
- Hey, fellas.

57:33.245 --> 57:35.080
Look, I'm a little
embarrassed

57:35.214 --> 57:37.516
by my behavior earlier...
I got a little crazy there.

57:37.649 --> 57:42.054
It's just been a long day of
excruciating pain and humiliation.

57:42.187 --> 57:44.456
I feel bad about
the way I behaved.

57:44.590 --> 57:47.059
I feel better now because being
with you guys means the world to me.

57:47.192 --> 57:51.096
As a token of my appreciation,
I made you guys these frosty piña coladas.

57:51.230 --> 57:53.365
One for everybody.
Get in there!

57:53.499 --> 57:56.335
- Can you get me one?
- Guys...

57:56.468 --> 57:58.737
- Thanks, man.
- Look how frothy these are.

57:58.871 --> 58:02.374
- Shelly did a fun thing. Look, Bob.
- Thank you, bro. Wow.

58:02.508 --> 58:04.843
Mmm. It's different,
but it's good.

58:04.977 --> 58:07.212
- Creamy, ooh.
- I like it.

58:07.346 --> 58:10.849
My mom always said, "If the drinks are
free, drink till you can't walk or see."

58:10.983 --> 58:14.086
Shelly, are you good?
I thought you were on the wagon.

58:14.219 --> 58:16.088
Never been better, buddy.
Never been better.

58:16.221 --> 58:18.891
This is exactly
what I needed.

58:19.023 --> 58:21.460
All right. Don't get too drunk
and then whip your pants down

58:21.593 --> 58:24.196
- and start playing with your empty bean bag chair.
- All right.

58:24.329 --> 58:27.165
- Hey, to Shelly.
- To Shelly Belly. Love you, Shel.

58:27.299 --> 58:28.834
Glad to
have you back, brother.

58:28.967 --> 58:31.236
Cheers, cheers.

58:31.370 --> 58:33.472
Yo, Doc,
I think you need to have

58:33.605 --> 58:36.742
a doctor look at that thing.
It's starting to drip.

58:36.875 --> 58:37.876
I am a doctor, Durf.

58:38.010 --> 58:39.211
So good, man!

58:39.344 --> 58:40.546
I didn't mean it
like that.

58:40.679 --> 58:42.981
So how's La La Land
treating you, bro?

58:43.115 --> 58:44.349
Yeah, Hollywood man.

58:44.483 --> 58:46.785
Pretty darn good.
I'm feeling blessed.

58:46.919 --> 58:50.322
- I got a lot of things coming down the pipeline.
- That's great, man.

58:50.455 --> 58:53.358
- Couple things in postproduction.
- What's postproduction?

58:53.492 --> 58:56.061
That's a good question.
Editing,

58:56.194 --> 58:58.664
color timing, scoring...

58:58.797 --> 59:00.165
Scoring, verb...

59:00.299 --> 59:02.234
What Zane does every night
with the ladies.

59:05.871 --> 59:07.839
You know what you should do?

59:07.973 --> 59:11.009
Seriously.
Work with Mark Wahlberg.

59:11.143 --> 59:12.377
Guy is money.

59:12.511 --> 59:14.813
He kicks all kinds of ass.

59:14.947 --> 59:17.482
He's got that itty-bitty waist,
but he seems like an accessible guy.

59:17.616 --> 59:19.117
Like, the kind of guy
you can talk to.

59:19.251 --> 59:21.086
That's a really helpful tip.
Thank you.

59:21.219 --> 59:22.654
Yeah, for sure.

59:22.788 --> 59:24.556
But seriously, like,
what do you got, Durfy?

59:24.690 --> 59:27.626
Uh, I was told not to
let anybody watch this,

59:27.759 --> 59:29.962
but I did get an early cut
of something

59:30.095 --> 59:32.831
that I have on my phone if you
guys want to take a little look.

59:32.965 --> 59:35.200
All right.

59:35.334 --> 59:38.103
You can't tell anyone
you saw this, though, okay?

59:38.236 --> 59:41.473
This is what we call
an industrial in the biz.

59:43.442 --> 59:45.243
Oh, she's pregnant.

59:45.377 --> 59:48.081
Who's that handsome guy?

59:48.213 --> 59:50.115
- Black-and-white. Nice touch.
- Artsy.

59:50.248 --> 59:51.917
She's cute.

59:52.051 --> 59:54.419
It's like <i>Raging Bull.</i>

59:54.553 --> 59:57.222
It's got a great twist,
too, you guys.

1:00:05.130 --> 1:00:07.033
Oh, God, she's so good.

1:00:07.165 --> 1:00:09.401
I really liked
working with her.

1:00:14.740 --> 1:00:16.541
Um...

1:00:16.675 --> 1:00:18.143
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

1:00:18.276 --> 1:00:20.479
Man, she gets me
when she gives that look.

1:00:20.612 --> 1:00:22.781
- What do you think?
- Yeah, it's...

1:00:22.914 --> 1:00:24.316
Let me get
this straight.

1:00:24.449 --> 1:00:27.086
You stay at home,
and your wife goes to war?

1:00:27.219 --> 1:00:30.822
Yeah, well, um, you know,
somebody has to watch the baby.

1:00:30.956 --> 1:00:33.291
I didn't write it.
I just act in it, so...

1:00:33.425 --> 1:00:35.861
No, totally. America thanks
you for your service, man.

1:00:35.994 --> 1:00:39.398
- How do you make yourself cry?
- On the day, I wasn't able to,

1:00:39.531 --> 1:00:41.767
so they just put
a drop in your eye.

1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:44.302
- You didn't cry?
- Well, not on that day.

1:00:44.436 --> 1:00:46.304
- Wow!
- I always though you actually cried.

1:00:46.438 --> 1:00:49.574
- I think it looks real.
- Come on. This...

1:00:49.708 --> 1:00:52.511
We're his best friends.
We owe him honesty here.

1:00:52.644 --> 1:00:56.149
Durf, I love you.
That's a terrible commercial.

1:00:56.281 --> 1:00:59.451
That's 100%
Rotten Tomatoes, man.

1:00:59.584 --> 1:01:01.820
Yeah, I have other things
maybe you'll dig.

1:01:01.953 --> 1:01:03.722
Of course you will,
and they'll be awesome.

1:01:03.855 --> 1:01:06.324
No, we're all pro-troops,
but that was anti-acting.

1:01:06.458 --> 1:01:09.227
That's good, though, dude.
Next time, Durf.

1:01:09.361 --> 1:01:11.164
I'm kidding, Dude.

1:01:11.296 --> 1:01:13.331
I'll get an eyedropper, dude.
Don't well up.

1:01:13.465 --> 1:01:16.234
I loved it. Hey, it's time
to announce the finalists.

1:01:16.368 --> 1:01:18.104
- Come on. Let's go.
- This is go time.

1:01:18.236 --> 1:01:19.971
- Come on, baby.
- Come on. Let's go.

1:01:21.306 --> 1:01:22.974
I liked your movie, Durf.

1:01:23.109 --> 1:01:25.343
Thanks, man.

1:01:26.545 --> 1:01:28.814
All right, boys, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1:01:28.947 --> 1:01:31.349
As you can see, I stand
among these tiki torches.

1:01:31.483 --> 1:01:33.852
These three tiki torches
represent the three guys

1:01:33.985 --> 1:01:36.321
who will be competing
in tomorrow's final event.

1:01:36.455 --> 1:01:38.690
If I call your name,
you're in. Ready?

1:01:38.824 --> 1:01:40.892
And remember,
we're playing for this.

1:01:41.026 --> 1:01:42.828
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

1:01:42.961 --> 1:01:46.631
- Say my name.
- The first finalist in this year's Buddy Games is...

1:01:46.765 --> 1:01:48.667
Bob Schmidt.

1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:51.137
Is there a Bob Schm...
Oh, that's me.

1:01:51.269 --> 1:01:53.271
That's me.

1:01:53.405 --> 1:01:56.142
All right,
game one, game one.

1:01:56.274 --> 1:01:58.243
Hey, check it.
The score's right here.

1:01:58.376 --> 1:02:01.313
And the next finalist is...

1:02:01.446 --> 1:02:03.014
Dixon Bender.

1:02:03.149 --> 1:02:05.118
- Yes!
- What?

1:02:05.283 --> 1:02:07.786
- I did better than Bender did.
- I did not see that coming.

1:02:07.919 --> 1:02:09.788
- Yep, I saw it coming.
- I want a recount.

1:02:09.921 --> 1:02:11.556
You'd be up here if you held
your shit the longest.

1:02:11.690 --> 1:02:13.625
That's right.
And the third finalist

1:02:13.759 --> 1:02:15.827
may not be the most
athletic guy here.

1:02:15.961 --> 1:02:18.131
- In fact, he's probably the least athletic guy here.
- Doc.

1:02:18.263 --> 1:02:21.600
- Oh, no. That's not good for me.
- He demonstrated nerves of steel

1:02:21.733 --> 1:02:25.037
in the face of dragons.
It's Shelly Baldinger!

1:02:25.171 --> 1:02:27.240
- Yeah!
- You got to be kidding me!

1:02:27.372 --> 1:02:29.841
- What? Are you joking?
- Yep.

1:02:29.975 --> 1:02:31.110
That's bullshit.

1:02:31.244 --> 1:02:32.544
Don't look so down, Durf.

1:02:32.677 --> 1:02:35.347
Maybe there's a tampon
commercial in your future.

1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:38.050
Yeah. Anything with
a vagina, you know?

1:02:38.184 --> 1:02:40.519
Or a fake baby.
You fuckers.

1:02:40.652 --> 1:02:44.022
I don't know how I'm not a finalist.

1:02:44.157 --> 1:02:46.992
- I want a recount.
- Hey, who wants a piña colada?

1:02:47.126 --> 1:02:50.263
- I want a piña colada!
- Who wants a piña colada?

1:02:50.395 --> 1:02:52.964
When I say "piña,"
you say "colada"!

1:02:53.099 --> 1:02:55.634
- Piña! Piña!
- Colada! Colada!

1:03:50.989 --> 1:03:52.424
Hey.

1:03:54.327 --> 1:03:56.761
Hey. Shelly.

1:03:57.296 --> 1:03:59.764
Shelly.

1:04:01.566 --> 1:04:04.070
Guys. Guys, come here.
Shelly's out cold here.

1:04:04.203 --> 1:04:06.771
Oh, you know what that means.
Balls and gravy!

1:04:06.905 --> 1:04:09.541
No, no, no, no. I'm serious.
I can't tell if he's breathing.

1:04:09.674 --> 1:04:12.245
- What? He's just passed out.
- All right, get out of my way.

1:04:12.377 --> 1:04:14.546
Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.

1:04:17.316 --> 1:04:18.850
- Oh, no.
- What?

1:04:18.984 --> 1:04:21.254
- This is bad, guys.
- Give it to us straight, Doc.

1:04:21.386 --> 1:04:23.722
It's an impingement
between C3 and C4.

1:04:23.855 --> 1:04:25.557
Are you kidding me?
Is he breathing?

1:04:25.690 --> 1:04:27.692
Yes, he's breathing.
He's fine.

1:04:27.826 --> 1:04:29.561
He's just
a big, ugly baby.

1:04:29.694 --> 1:04:31.897
He's fine.
He's sleeping.

1:04:32.597 --> 1:04:35.600
Where's... Where's Durfy?

1:04:35.734 --> 1:04:37.602
- I don't know.
- That's odd.

1:04:37.736 --> 1:04:40.373
- Durfy!
- Durf!

1:04:40.505 --> 1:04:43.175
- Durfy! Durfy!
- Durf! Durf!

1:04:44.609 --> 1:04:46.611
This is bullshit.

1:04:46.745 --> 1:04:49.481
I'm gonna pack my bags
and get out of here.

1:04:54.819 --> 1:04:57.189
What the hell is that?

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:05.364
What the fuck?

1:05:05.497 --> 1:05:07.465
- He's not out there.
- His car's still here.

1:05:07.599 --> 1:05:10.202
- He's not in his room.
- I called him. He didn't answer.

1:05:10.336 --> 1:05:12.171
- Where would he be?
- Oh, you guys.

1:05:12.305 --> 1:05:13.538
- What?
- The commercial.

1:05:13.672 --> 1:05:15.141
His commercial
about lady Marines.

1:05:15.274 --> 1:05:17.609
Dude, our own military might
attack us over that commercial.

1:05:17.742 --> 1:05:20.246
- We shit all over it.
- We were being honest. It sucked.

1:05:20.379 --> 1:05:23.682
- We didn't have to be that honest.
- You know how sensitive he is.

1:05:23.815 --> 1:05:25.418
Fuck! He probably
wandered off somewhere.

1:05:25.583 --> 1:05:28.553
- We got to go looking for him.
- Somebody's got to watch Shelly.

1:05:28.687 --> 1:05:29.955
The doctor should.

1:05:30.089 --> 1:05:30.922
I want Bender to stay.

1:05:31.057 --> 1:05:32.425
- You hear that?
- What'd you say?

1:05:32.557 --> 1:05:34.160
He picked Bender.

1:05:34.293 --> 1:05:36.728
- He said "Doctor."
- He said "Bender." I heard him.

1:05:36.861 --> 1:05:38.863
- Bender, you stay here. Stay with him.
- Are you kidding me?

1:05:38.997 --> 1:05:40.899
Grab the torches, boys.
Let's go find him.

1:05:41.033 --> 1:05:43.802
What if he wakes up?
Do I have to talk to him?

1:05:46.372 --> 1:05:47.806
Stay back!

1:05:52.078 --> 1:05:53.578
Leave me alone!

1:05:54.713 --> 1:05:56.681
Oh! Shelter.

1:06:22.574 --> 1:06:24.076
Durfy?

1:06:25.643 --> 1:06:28.147
- Durf!
- Durf and Turf?

1:06:28.980 --> 1:06:31.716
What is that? What is that?

1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:37.756
How's it getting
in the door?

1:06:40.393 --> 1:06:43.028
What?

1:06:50.602 --> 1:06:53.272
Where are you?

1:06:56.409 --> 1:06:58.277
You hear that?

1:06:58.411 --> 1:06:59.944
Oh, my God.

1:07:00.678 --> 1:07:02.481
- That way.
- Let's go get our boy.

1:07:02.614 --> 1:07:04.183
We're coming, Durf!

1:07:29.041 --> 1:07:30.775
What?

1:07:31.709 --> 1:07:33.778
That's weird.

1:07:45.857 --> 1:07:48.194
Don't make me do this.

1:07:48.327 --> 1:07:49.661
Please!

1:07:49.794 --> 1:07:52.764
Okay, I'm going
to let you go.

1:07:52.897 --> 1:07:55.034
Stop fighting, okay?

1:07:55.167 --> 1:07:56.502
Stay down.

1:07:59.105 --> 1:08:01.140
Whore! Okay!

1:08:04.110 --> 1:08:06.512
- Die you little...
- That's a tiny thing!

1:08:06.644 --> 1:08:09.281
Durfy...
Knock it off, man!

1:08:09.415 --> 1:08:11.150
Stop, man, stop!

1:08:11.983 --> 1:08:14.353
Did he kill it?

1:08:15.521 --> 1:08:16.888
Oh, my God!

1:08:17.021 --> 1:08:19.592
You guys, that thing
was trying to kill me.

1:08:19.724 --> 1:08:21.293
- Oh, my God.
- That little thing right there?

1:08:21.427 --> 1:08:23.828
Yeah, it looks cute,
but it came in that shed

1:08:23.962 --> 1:08:25.897
and got my ear
and my face.

1:08:26.031 --> 1:08:28.633
- Holy mother of God.
- You look like shit, man.

1:08:28.766 --> 1:08:30.436
Is that right?
I look like shit?

1:08:30.569 --> 1:08:32.871
My commercial sucks. Do you
want to say anything else?

1:08:33.004 --> 1:08:35.874
- I was just busting...
- No, no, I heard you loud and clear.

1:08:36.007 --> 1:08:37.842
I heard you loud and clear.
The commercial sucked.

1:08:37.976 --> 1:08:40.312
- We were just busting your chops.
- You know what else?

1:08:40.446 --> 1:08:42.714
I'm not fucking making it
in Hollywood, okay?

1:08:42.847 --> 1:08:45.783
Are you happy?
I don't have an agent.

1:08:45.917 --> 1:08:48.753
I self-submit
to extras casting, okay?

1:08:48.887 --> 1:08:50.822
I sell tape.

1:08:50.955 --> 1:08:53.559
And right before I got here,
I shit the bed

1:08:53.691 --> 1:08:56.629
on probably the best opportunity
I'm ever gonna have for a CW pilot.

1:08:56.761 --> 1:08:59.898
And it's fucking gone, and that's it, okay?
So I fucking suck!

1:09:00.032 --> 1:09:02.334
- You don't suck.
- You feel fucking funny now?

1:09:02.468 --> 1:09:04.436
You want to make some
fucking jokes about that?

1:09:04.570 --> 1:09:07.506
Durfy, calm down.
You're a little fired up right now.

1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:10.543
No, no, no. Don't calm down.
Let him get it out.

1:09:10.675 --> 1:09:15.247
What is this, Durf, huh? What is this,
your fucking goodbye speech? Huh?

1:09:15.381 --> 1:09:17.982
We throw a little tough love your
way, and you throw in the towel?

1:09:18.117 --> 1:09:20.952
You want to be an actor or not?
Start filming this.

1:09:21.086 --> 1:09:24.190
You want to fucking be an actor
on a CW pilot, Durfy?

1:09:24.323 --> 1:09:27.159
- Use it! Use it!
- Show me! Show me!

1:09:27.293 --> 1:09:29.328
You guys, I just got attacked
by a fucking mink.

1:09:29.461 --> 1:09:32.131
I'm not auditioning
in the woods, okay?

1:09:34.466 --> 1:09:36.602
- I'm not gonna do this!
- Do it right now!

1:09:36.734 --> 1:09:40.172
You guys knew what I was the whole
time, and you didn't tell me?

1:09:42.074 --> 1:09:43.942
I thought I had cancer,
damn it.

1:09:44.076 --> 1:09:46.679
Okay, so I'm a mutant?

1:09:46.811 --> 1:09:49.048
So I'm gonna dedicate
the rest of my life...

1:09:50.082 --> 1:09:52.418
to putting those
who would do ill to others

1:09:52.551 --> 1:09:54.819
straight in the fucking ground.

1:09:54.953 --> 1:09:57.855
And I don't care
if I have to die doing it.

1:09:59.791 --> 1:10:02.661
John Durfy Jr,
<i>Mutant Institute.</i>

1:10:02.794 --> 1:10:04.929
Yeah!

1:10:05.064 --> 1:10:07.166
You guys,
that last part was improv.

1:10:07.299 --> 1:10:09.301
Yeah, Durfy! Yeah!

1:10:09.435 --> 1:10:12.770
That's not even in the script.
It's not even in the script.

1:10:27.885 --> 1:10:29.355
Hi, Dixon.

1:10:32.258 --> 1:10:33.525
Hey, Shelly.

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:38.130
Have an extra bowl of
Cuckoo Puffs this morning?

1:10:38.264 --> 1:10:41.400
When are you gonna learn
to shut the fuck up, Bender?

1:10:41.533 --> 1:10:43.502
Why am I here?

1:10:43.636 --> 1:10:46.171
That is a really good question.
What are you doing here?

1:10:46.305 --> 1:10:49.275
You're not supposed to be here.
I was very clear about that.

1:10:49.408 --> 1:10:51.577
I have every right to be here.
I'm one of your oldest friends,

1:10:51.710 --> 1:10:54.812
and I'm here to preserve
the sanctity of our friendship

1:10:54.946 --> 1:10:56.948
and to beat your ass
in the Buddy Games.

1:10:57.082 --> 1:10:59.585
I'm gonna wipe your ass
out there today.

1:10:59.718 --> 1:11:01.420
You're gonna wipe my ass?

1:11:01.553 --> 1:11:02.920
Yeah, with your face.

1:11:03.055 --> 1:11:05.190
You're gonna wipe my ass
with my face.

1:11:05.324 --> 1:11:06.891
Got it, bud.

1:11:07.025 --> 1:11:09.762
And I'm sure that Bob
will make that happen.

1:11:09.894 --> 1:11:12.298
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You don't think this is all rigged for you?

1:11:12.431 --> 1:11:16.535
Like you didn't know that?
Look, you made your point. Just let me out.

1:11:19.937 --> 1:11:21.407
What the fuck are you doing?

1:11:21.540 --> 1:11:23.242
You know what
your problem is, Bender?

1:11:24.809 --> 1:11:27.879
You don't know when to shut the fuck up!

1:11:28.012 --> 1:11:30.815
No! You crazy fuck!

1:11:30.948 --> 1:11:33.218
- No! All right, no!
- Yeah!

1:11:33.352 --> 1:11:35.621
I won't say anything else.
I'll stop talking.

1:11:36.555 --> 1:11:38.923
Oh, I really want to
believe you when you say

1:11:39.058 --> 1:11:43.295
that the sanctity of our lifelong
friendship means something to you,

1:11:43.429 --> 1:11:44.563
but...

1:11:45.863 --> 1:11:47.232
I don't.

1:11:49.768 --> 1:11:51.836
Is that supposed to
scare me?

1:11:51.969 --> 1:11:53.539
When's the last time
you've driven a car?

1:11:53.672 --> 1:11:55.140
Your mom
dropped you off here.

1:11:55.274 --> 1:11:56.508
Don't you talk
about my mama.

1:11:56.642 --> 1:11:58.876
Then get your fat ass
out of my mom's van!

1:11:59.010 --> 1:12:00.279
You say you're sorry.

1:12:00.412 --> 1:12:01.380
Sorry for what?

1:12:01.513 --> 1:12:02.481
For ruining my life.

1:12:02.614 --> 1:12:04.049
I didn't ruin your life!

1:12:04.183 --> 1:12:05.617
You fucking say it!

1:12:05.751 --> 1:12:07.119
Fuck you!

1:12:09.854 --> 1:12:12.191
No! No!
Wait, wait, wait!

1:12:12.324 --> 1:12:14.626
I didn't shoot you!
I didn't shoot you!

1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:16.128
I didn't do...

1:12:18.797 --> 1:12:20.432
No!

1:12:28.474 --> 1:12:29.775
What did you say?

1:12:29.907 --> 1:12:31.310
I said you're
a piece of shit!

1:12:31.443 --> 1:12:33.645
No, that's not what you said.
You said you didn't do it.

1:12:33.779 --> 1:12:37.349
Of course I didn't do it, man.
I'm not an animal.

1:12:37.483 --> 1:12:40.918
I wouldn't shoot a man in the
balls, let alone my friend.

1:12:41.053 --> 1:12:43.722
I love balls.
I have two of them.

1:12:43.856 --> 1:12:48.527
Okay. You didn't do it?
Who did?

1:12:50.596 --> 1:12:52.030
Nikki.

1:12:52.564 --> 1:12:54.133
Bullshit.

1:12:58.570 --> 1:13:00.172
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:13:00.938 --> 1:13:03.075
Why don't you teach him
a lesson.

1:13:03.208 --> 1:13:05.177
From us. Come on.
It'll be fun.

1:13:05.310 --> 1:13:08.680
- Rest it. Let it sit there.
- Right on the nose.

1:13:10.716 --> 1:13:12.050
What if I did it
right there?

1:13:12.184 --> 1:13:13.485
- Shoot him.
- Ooh.

1:13:13.619 --> 1:13:15.888
<i>But I couldn't do it.</i>

1:13:16.855 --> 1:13:19.658
<i>So she took the gun from me
and pulled the trigger.</i>

1:13:28.167 --> 1:13:30.803
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What did you do?

1:13:30.935 --> 1:13:33.138
Then why wouldn't
you say something, huh?

1:13:33.272 --> 1:13:35.307
Why would you
protect her?

1:13:35.441 --> 1:13:38.610
- I was protecting you.
- Protecting me?

1:13:38.744 --> 1:13:42.013
- Your marriage.
- If you wanted to protect me, you could've stopped her.

1:13:42.147 --> 1:13:45.250
Do you think I knew that she was
gonna shoot you in the scrotum?

1:13:45.384 --> 1:13:48.986
All right, I could've taken the gun
away, but I didn't.

1:13:49.121 --> 1:13:51.123
Can somebody get me out of
this fucking thing, man?

1:13:51.256 --> 1:13:53.392
I got it. I got it.

1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:58.897
Do you want to know why I didn't?

1:13:59.031 --> 1:14:01.533
Maybe it's because
you were being

1:14:01.667 --> 1:14:04.570
- a drunk, obnoxious asshole.
- This fucking guy.

1:14:04.703 --> 1:14:07.739
Or maybe I did it because you
put your balls on our foreheads

1:14:07.873 --> 1:14:09.741
for years
and just laughed it up.

1:14:09.875 --> 1:14:12.578
Or maybe I liked

1:14:12.711 --> 1:14:14.413
that you thought it was me
all these years.

1:14:14.546 --> 1:14:17.149
Because whether or not
I pulled the trigger,

1:14:17.282 --> 1:14:20.052
- you got what you deserved, bud.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

1:14:20.185 --> 1:14:23.355
- He doesn't mean that. Bender, you don't mean that.
- Nobody deserves...

1:14:23.489 --> 1:14:25.524
Guys, I got to
come clean. In '95,

1:14:25.657 --> 1:14:29.127
when I won the cup,
I was juicing.

1:14:29.261 --> 1:14:32.764
I got to get it off my chest. I don't want
you to scratch my name off the cup though.

1:14:32.898 --> 1:14:36.702
Nobody's gonna scratch anything
off anything. Shell Bell,

1:14:36.835 --> 1:14:40.339
I think it's pretty clear
that Bender feels terribly.

1:14:40.472 --> 1:14:43.007
I mean, he gifted you
his own personal spank bank.

1:14:43.141 --> 1:14:44.576
That's a gesture.

1:14:44.710 --> 1:14:46.712
- Am I right? That was a real gesture.
- Yeah.

1:14:46.845 --> 1:14:48.847
- You're right.
- Yeah, which I want back.

1:14:48.981 --> 1:14:50.616
You're unfit
to raise my children.

1:14:50.749 --> 1:14:53.151
- That's not gonna happen?
- What do you mean?

1:14:53.285 --> 1:14:55.587
Can't do it.
I already re-gifted it.

1:14:55.721 --> 1:14:57.021
- To who?
- What?

1:14:57.155 --> 1:14:58.557
You like those piña coladas?

1:14:58.690 --> 1:15:00.726
Mmm. Little bit
of Bender in there?

1:15:01.426 --> 1:15:02.995
Oh, no.

1:15:03.128 --> 1:15:05.097
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1:15:05.230 --> 1:15:07.366
You're joking? That's a joke?

1:15:07.499 --> 1:15:09.334
Oh, my...
Oh, my God.

1:15:09.468 --> 1:15:12.704
- No.
- I knew I tasted jizz!

1:15:12.838 --> 1:15:15.507
Bob, get him back
in the loony bin right now.

1:15:15.641 --> 1:15:17.643
Call his mom
and have her pick him up.

1:15:17.776 --> 1:15:19.978
- That is grounds for disqualification.
- I'm calling the cops.

1:15:20.112 --> 1:15:24.249
What are you going to tell the cops?
"Hey, Officer, I drank my own jizz"?

1:15:24.383 --> 1:15:26.151
Hold up. Hold up.

1:15:27.452 --> 1:15:29.721
Why are we surprised
by this?

1:15:29.855 --> 1:15:32.691
This is the kind of stupid shit that
happens every time we get together.

1:15:32.824 --> 1:15:36.328
I mean, I never thought I was
gonna forgive you guys for this.

1:15:37.629 --> 1:15:40.033
- I was so pissed at you guys.
- Still a great piece.

1:15:40.165 --> 1:15:42.167
You remember that one?
That was you guys.

1:15:42.301 --> 1:15:45.170
Sons of bitches!
And this? Fucking...

1:15:45.304 --> 1:15:47.906
- Zac Efron.
- That was your idea.

1:15:48.041 --> 1:15:49.107
You did that
on your own, bro.

1:15:49.241 --> 1:15:50.175
Your choice.

1:15:50.309 --> 1:15:51.376
You wanted that.

1:15:51.510 --> 1:15:53.845
- You all gave me the...
- No. No.

1:15:53.979 --> 1:15:56.248
Look, the point is
that every time we get together,

1:15:56.381 --> 1:15:58.051
we do something that
we regret in the moment,

1:15:58.183 --> 1:16:00.419
but then we laugh about it
later, right?

1:16:00.552 --> 1:16:03.689
That's why we keep coming back.
These are the games we play.

1:16:03.822 --> 1:16:07.192
These are the memories that we live for.
And, yeah, we drank a little jizz...

1:16:07.326 --> 1:16:08.760
We drank a lot of jizz.

1:16:08.894 --> 1:16:10.262
We drank a lot of jizz.

1:16:10.395 --> 1:16:11.830
I had a second piña colada.

1:16:11.964 --> 1:16:15.068
And Shelly totaled
Bender's van, but you know what?

1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:16.969
This too shall pass.
We will live on,

1:16:17.102 --> 1:16:19.605
and this brotherhood
will never die.

1:16:21.206 --> 1:16:24.209
And I fucking love it!
I love all of it.

1:16:24.343 --> 1:16:26.178
And I've missed every one
of you assholes.

1:16:26.311 --> 1:16:28.614
And I wouldn't trade this shit
for anything, so...

1:16:28.747 --> 1:16:30.749
I suggest that each one of you
look in the mirror

1:16:30.882 --> 1:16:33.018
and think about what this
brotherhood means to you.

1:16:33.185 --> 1:16:35.020
Especially you, Durfy.

1:16:35.153 --> 1:16:37.422
Your ear,
it's, like, hanging...

1:16:37.556 --> 1:16:39.625
Is it injured?
'Cause it doesn't feel good.

1:16:39.758 --> 1:16:42.628
- You might want peroxide...
- You think that's gonna read on camera?

1:16:42.761 --> 1:16:45.330
- Not if the camera's pointed at someone else.
- Thanks for inviting me.

1:16:45.464 --> 1:16:47.199
- You're a good person.
- Yeah, yeah, you too.

1:16:47.332 --> 1:16:50.535
Thanks for letting me play, and thanks
for the piña coladas and my ear.

1:16:50.669 --> 1:16:51.903
It's just
been really great.

1:16:52.038 --> 1:16:53.338
All right.

1:16:53.472 --> 1:16:55.974
The rest of you
get a little sleep,

1:16:56.109 --> 1:16:57.876
because come sundown,
it's game on.

1:17:00.512 --> 1:17:03.315
- Not so much you two.
- Nope, we are sleeping in.

1:17:03.448 --> 1:17:05.884
Didn't make the cut.

1:17:06.018 --> 1:17:07.619
Shelly,
you went too far.

1:17:07.753 --> 1:17:10.322
- Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
- Yeah, Shelly.

1:17:10.455 --> 1:17:12.524
Well played.

1:17:34.446 --> 1:17:35.947
So here we are, boys.

1:17:37.549 --> 1:17:39.184
The endgame.
It's simple.

1:17:39.317 --> 1:17:41.120
First one to lay their hands

1:17:41.253 --> 1:17:43.655
on that buddy bucket
at the end of this field

1:17:43.789 --> 1:17:45.257
wins all the cash.

1:17:45.390 --> 1:17:47.160
What's with the suit?

1:17:47.292 --> 1:17:48.827
Oh, this old thing?

1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:53.198
It's a one-inch-thick
superpolyamide body armor suit.

1:17:53.331 --> 1:17:54.800
Why? What the fuck
are we doing now?

1:17:54.933 --> 1:17:57.369
Well, this little baby
can absorb a bullet

1:17:57.502 --> 1:17:59.371
- from ten feet away.
- What?

1:17:59.504 --> 1:18:01.306
All we're gonna be using
are simple bows and arrows.

1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:02.908
Give it a try.

1:18:04.409 --> 1:18:06.778
- You want me to shoot you with an arrow?
- Yeah.

1:18:06.912 --> 1:18:08.447
Okay.

1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:10.348
There you go.

1:18:12.951 --> 1:18:14.386
I like this already.

1:18:18.824 --> 1:18:20.492
Oh, no!

1:18:21.127 --> 1:18:22.828
- Bob!
- What the fuck?

1:18:22.961 --> 1:18:23.895
Holy shit!

1:18:24.029 --> 1:18:24.996
Oh, my God.

1:18:25.131 --> 1:18:27.100
Bob! Oh, my...

1:18:27.232 --> 1:18:29.102
Oh! Help!

1:18:33.905 --> 1:18:35.907
You should see the looks
on your faces!

1:18:36.042 --> 1:18:39.511
- I'm just kidding.
- Oh, my... Dude, what the fuck, man?

1:18:39.644 --> 1:18:41.880
That's the game.
That's the game.

1:18:42.013 --> 1:18:45.051
You got six arrows right over here.
Use them wisely,

1:18:45.184 --> 1:18:47.853
because if you get stuck
with an arrow, you're out.

1:18:47.986 --> 1:18:50.189
Ten minutes, shotgun start,
so suit up, boys.

1:18:50.322 --> 1:18:51.723
Whoo!

1:18:52.390 --> 1:18:54.526
Ow. Bob, you're...

1:18:54.659 --> 1:18:57.395
Bob's not well mentally,
I don't...

1:19:03.735 --> 1:19:05.570
I don't know
who to root for.

1:19:05.704 --> 1:19:07.305
- I hate them all.
- Yeah, it's tough.

1:19:07.439 --> 1:19:09.674
- I'm going Bender.
- You're gonna go Bender?

1:19:09.808 --> 1:19:12.344
- Bender.
- He lost his mom. He lives in a van.

1:19:12.477 --> 1:19:15.248
He's had hemorrhoids
since we were, what, six?

1:19:15.380 --> 1:19:18.950
How many fucking six-year-olds do
you know that have hemorrhoids?

1:19:20.619 --> 1:19:24.389
Hey, everybody. Welcome back.

1:19:26.858 --> 1:19:28.927
You know what's
fucking crazy?

1:19:29.061 --> 1:19:30.629
Like, seriously?

1:19:30.762 --> 1:19:33.199
How slimming
black really is.

1:19:33.331 --> 1:19:34.866
One little announcement.

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.036
That field is live.
Real arrows will be flying.

1:19:37.170 --> 1:19:39.504
So, please, if you could
stay behind these flags

1:19:39.638 --> 1:19:41.706
until you can see that
champion bucket is raised.

1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:44.210
- Smell weird to you?
- Oh, fuck, man!

1:19:44.342 --> 1:19:47.246
Oh, let me get a shot really quick.
You got any schnapps?

1:19:47.379 --> 1:19:50.448
Why do you have a nut cup?
Aren't those supposed to protect testicles?

1:19:50.582 --> 1:19:54.053
Aren't minivans meant for mothers?
Oh, that's right. You don't have a minivan.

1:19:54.187 --> 1:19:56.922
Yeah, thanks. I don't have a mother either.
You're about to lose.

1:19:57.056 --> 1:19:59.024
You're about to burp up
your own cum bubbles.

1:19:59.158 --> 1:20:00.492
You're gonna
fucking lose, man.

1:20:00.625 --> 1:20:02.961
This is your day...

1:20:07.465 --> 1:20:09.367
Bye, suckers!

1:20:21.613 --> 1:20:25.117
Let's go, babe! Come on.
You got this. Let's go!

1:20:42.235 --> 1:20:44.270
Okay, babe, you got this!

1:20:44.402 --> 1:20:45.871
Let's go, baby!

1:20:48.274 --> 1:20:51.244
Ah!

1:20:53.312 --> 1:20:54.746
Oh, my God.

1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:56.648
Suck on that,
Richie Rich!

1:20:56.781 --> 1:20:59.885
Bob!

1:21:01.686 --> 1:21:03.155
Bob! Bob!
No, wait...

1:21:04.290 --> 1:21:06.391
Shit just got real.

1:21:17.636 --> 1:21:19.871
Okay. Shelly's
sucking wind right now.

1:21:20.005 --> 1:21:22.241
He's not gonna be able
to shoot for shit.

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:24.310
It's now or never.

1:21:24.442 --> 1:21:26.011
Let's go, Bender.

1:21:26.978 --> 1:21:29.981
We already know how
this will end, Bender!

1:21:30.116 --> 1:21:32.784
I own you! I always have!

1:21:34.719 --> 1:21:36.922
You always said,
"There's next year," Shelly.

1:21:37.056 --> 1:21:40.192
Well, guess what?
It is next year!

1:21:40.326 --> 1:21:45.664
I guess it boils down to
who's got the bigger balls.

1:21:45.797 --> 1:21:48.167
Well, that'd definitely
be you, pal.

1:21:48.301 --> 1:21:50.969
No, no, no.
Ladies first.

1:21:53.272 --> 1:21:55.308
Aaah! Fuck you!

1:22:03.581 --> 1:22:05.717
Ooh, look at that fat back.

1:22:05.850 --> 1:22:08.553
Here we go, baby.

1:22:11.157 --> 1:22:13.792
- Damn it!
- Crap!

1:22:13.925 --> 1:22:16.962
Yeah, let's dance, baby.

1:22:18.863 --> 1:22:20.266
It's over. It's over.

1:22:20.399 --> 1:22:23.169
Fuck you, Bender.
Fuck you.

1:22:25.104 --> 1:22:27.772
Sorry about all that stuff
I said about you earlier, buddy.

1:22:29.208 --> 1:22:30.542
No, you're not, Sheldon.

1:22:33.578 --> 1:22:34.946
Just end it.

1:22:36.382 --> 1:22:39.051
Don't shoot me in the balls either.
That'd be super predictable and lame.

1:22:39.185 --> 1:22:42.654
Always the bridesmaid,
never the bride.

1:22:46.225 --> 1:22:49.527
- You fucking caught that?
- You were gonna shoot me in the face?

1:22:58.570 --> 1:23:00.772
Get off me!
Get off me!

1:23:00.905 --> 1:23:03.842
You son of a bitch!

1:23:09.614 --> 1:23:13.119
Not this year!

1:23:18.157 --> 1:23:20.992
No! No!

1:23:21.127 --> 1:23:24.029
Never fuck with
a man's minivan.

1:23:33.605 --> 1:23:35.241
I got it. I got it.

1:23:47.886 --> 1:23:50.789
Yeah!

1:23:54.826 --> 1:23:58.029
Yeah!
I fucking did it!

1:23:58.164 --> 1:24:01.033
You okay, buddy?
No shame. You did good.

1:24:01.167 --> 1:24:03.069
- You did really good.
- How many fingers is this?

1:24:03.202 --> 1:24:05.937
Just not as good as that
motherfucker right there!

1:24:06.072 --> 1:24:08.140
You just kicked him
in the head, Doc!

1:24:08.274 --> 1:24:10.076
Bobby, are you okay?

1:24:10.209 --> 1:24:12.977
- Oh, my goodness, look at that.
- Bob!

1:24:13.112 --> 1:24:14.547
Oh, my God!

1:24:14.679 --> 1:24:16.449
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, you came.

1:24:16.581 --> 1:24:18.983
- We've got to get you to the hospital.
- No, no, I'm fine.

1:24:19.118 --> 1:24:22.121
I really am. I'm fine.
Well, not great.

1:24:22.254 --> 1:24:24.022
Oh, my God!

1:24:24.156 --> 1:24:27.059
Oh, I know what you're gonna say,
that this whole thing was a mistake.

1:24:27.193 --> 1:24:29.228
No, I wasn't gonna
say that at all.

1:24:30.429 --> 1:24:31.696
Bobby, you needed this.

1:24:31.830 --> 1:24:33.032
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:24:33.165 --> 1:24:34.899
Now that it's out
of your system,

1:24:35.034 --> 1:24:36.734
- we can just go back to our life, you know?
- Yeah.

1:24:36.868 --> 1:24:38.803
God, I love you.

1:24:39.572 --> 1:24:41.873
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

1:24:42.006 --> 1:24:45.743
I was doing a lot of thinking
on my trip, and, um...

1:24:46.512 --> 1:24:49.115
I think it's time, Bob.

1:24:49.248 --> 1:24:50.382
Yeah.

1:24:51.484 --> 1:24:54.153
- All right, come on. Let's do this.
- I... I can't.

1:24:54.286 --> 1:24:56.621
Oh, God, because your...
your hand.

1:24:56.754 --> 1:24:58.457
- Let me help you.
- Whoa!

1:24:58.591 --> 1:25:00.825
Whoa! Yeah!

1:25:00.959 --> 1:25:03.761
It is huge!
How much was it?

1:25:03.895 --> 1:25:06.065
I don't know.

1:25:06.198 --> 1:25:08.033
I don't know!

1:25:10.603 --> 1:25:12.338
Okay, everybody's
watching, Bob.

1:25:13.139 --> 1:25:14.839
Look, baby, I know
that you're scared.

1:25:14.973 --> 1:25:17.376
That's okay, and I get it,
but you don't need to be.

1:25:17.510 --> 1:25:19.411
These last few weeks,
yeah, they have been weird,

1:25:19.545 --> 1:25:21.614
but we can just go back
to the way things used to be.

1:25:21.746 --> 1:25:23.282
Just you and me...

1:25:23.748 --> 1:25:25.717
forever.

1:25:27.119 --> 1:25:28.887
- I love you.
- Oh, my God. I love you too.

1:25:29.020 --> 1:25:31.723
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1:25:34.493 --> 1:25:36.262
I'm not this guy.

1:25:37.962 --> 1:25:39.998
I'm not the guy you deserve.

1:25:40.566 --> 1:25:42.201
I'm this fucking guy.

1:25:42.734 --> 1:25:44.203
What?

1:25:44.336 --> 1:25:47.672
My mom wants me to be Bob,
the soon-to-be father, but...

1:25:47.805 --> 1:25:49.941
I'm just the Bobfather,
you know?

1:25:50.075 --> 1:25:53.112
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Look, I know this sounds crazy.

1:25:53.245 --> 1:25:56.315
I've never felt more purpose
than I have these last few weeks.

1:25:57.249 --> 1:26:00.252
These guys need me,
and I need them,

1:26:00.386 --> 1:26:02.954
and this is gonna keep happening
every year for the rest of my life.

1:26:03.088 --> 1:26:06.024
And you're just gonna end up
hating them and resenting me.

1:26:06.158 --> 1:26:07.892
And who knows? Maybe you'll
end up shooting me in the balls

1:26:08.026 --> 1:26:09.894
and taking all my money
like Shel...

1:26:10.762 --> 1:26:13.032
- Oh!
- Bobby!

1:26:15.767 --> 1:26:17.503
You know, I really
respect your choice...

1:26:17.636 --> 1:26:19.071
and your honesty.

1:26:19.205 --> 1:26:21.040
I just wish you would've
told me five fucking years ago

1:26:21.173 --> 1:26:22.541
that you would've chosen
your friend's balls

1:26:22.675 --> 1:26:24.276
and their farts
over me.

1:26:26.345 --> 1:26:28.380
- Where's the gravity? I...
- Oh, my God.

1:26:28.514 --> 1:26:31.584
Okay, okay, okay, that's enough.
You got it out of your system.

1:26:31.716 --> 1:26:33.319
Farewell, Bobfather.

1:26:33.452 --> 1:26:37.489
Now, nobody does that to my buddy Bob.

1:26:37.623 --> 1:26:39.358
- Ooh!
- Doc!

1:26:39.491 --> 1:26:41.260
You are done, Tiff!

1:26:43.562 --> 1:26:46.065
Mama, start the car.
Start the car, Mama!

1:26:46.198 --> 1:26:47.366
Later, Tiff.

1:27:00.646 --> 1:27:02.814
<i>Well,
things didn't go exactly as planned,</i>

1:27:02.947 --> 1:27:05.917
<i>but then again,
the games never do.</i>

1:27:06.051 --> 1:27:09.088
<i>Look, you don't stop playing
because you get older,</i>

1:27:09.221 --> 1:27:11.923
<i>you get older
when you stop playing.</i>

1:27:12.057 --> 1:27:14.693
<i>Now the boys are back,</i>

1:27:14.826 --> 1:27:16.894
<i>and somehow everything
seems right again.</i>

1:27:17.028 --> 1:27:20.832
<i>In fact, things might even
be a little better.</i>

1:27:44.089 --> 1:27:46.824
<i>Shelly may not have
reclaimed his throne,</i>

1:27:46.958 --> 1:27:49.161
<i>but he's back.</i>

1:27:49.295 --> 1:27:51.563
<i>Exactly where he belongs.</i>

1:27:53.332 --> 1:27:55.100
Still the king.

1:27:58.637 --> 1:28:02.174
<i>Turns out Durfy may not be
such a shitty actor after all.</i>

1:28:02.940 --> 1:28:05.311
<i>He just needed a little nudge.</i>

1:28:07.413 --> 1:28:11.417
"You have officially been offered
the role of Frankie in..."

1:28:13.485 --> 1:28:15.254
Oh, my God!

1:28:16.755 --> 1:28:18.223
Yes!

1:28:19.124 --> 1:28:21.393
<i>And then there's Bender.</i>

1:28:21.527 --> 1:28:23.329
- <i>Look at him.</i>
- Call Sheldon again.

1:28:23.462 --> 1:28:26.465
- <i>That's the face of a champion.</i>
- <i>Calling Sheldon.</i>

1:28:32.538 --> 1:28:34.173
Nope.

1:28:34.972 --> 1:28:37.443
- <i>Call declined.</i>
- Come on, man!

1:28:38.610 --> 1:28:41.347
- Call Sheldon again. Call him again!
- <i>Please watch your tone.</i>

1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:43.315
<i>As for Doc, well,</i>

1:28:43.449 --> 1:28:45.651
<i>he was finally able to
provide some relief.</i>

1:28:47.985 --> 1:28:50.422
It's time I got something
off my chest.

1:28:50.556 --> 1:28:52.524
So here goes.

1:28:52.658 --> 1:28:54.760
- I'm, uh...
- I know.

1:28:54.892 --> 1:28:56.861
- What do you mean, you know?
- I know.

1:28:56.994 --> 1:28:59.498
- How long have you known?
- Remember back in '96,

1:28:59.631 --> 1:29:02.668
when you bought that Cavalier
King Charles spaniel,

1:29:02.801 --> 1:29:05.804
and you named it after Brad Pitt's
character in <i>Legends of the Fall?</i>

1:29:05.937 --> 1:29:08.040
- Oh, Tristan.
- Way before that.

1:29:08.173 --> 1:29:09.575
All right, one more.

1:29:09.708 --> 1:29:10.642
I'm gay!

1:29:10.776 --> 1:29:11.909
All right, you're all done.

1:29:12.044 --> 1:29:14.146
Oh, that felt amazing!

1:29:14.279 --> 1:29:17.349
So if I'm not happy with the
results, I get a full refund, right?

1:29:17.483 --> 1:29:19.016
'Cause I burn through
workout equipment

1:29:19.151 --> 1:29:21.620
like Gene Simmons does
through pussy.

1:29:21.754 --> 1:29:23.155
From Kiss.

1:29:23.288 --> 1:29:26.958
I mean, fitness is
my middle name.

1:29:27.092 --> 1:29:28.660
And I'm just afraid...
You know, like,

1:29:28.794 --> 1:29:31.630
I've broken things before,
'cause I'm so strong, and I'm...

1:29:31.764 --> 1:29:34.999
- Shelly, just hear me out.
- What are you doing here, dude?

1:29:35.134 --> 1:29:37.236
I'm in trouble,
and it's bad.

1:29:37.369 --> 1:29:39.405
- I need a place to hide out.
- No, man!

1:29:39.538 --> 1:29:41.874
Oh, my God,
I'm in deep shit, man!

1:29:42.006 --> 1:29:45.144
Get the fuck out of my house, dude.
What are you doing here?

1:29:45.277 --> 1:29:49.047
- Bender!
- No! No! Aaah!

1:29:52.785 --> 1:29:54.653
You're mine, bitch.

1:29:58.891 --> 1:30:02.026
You shot my best friend,
you son of a bitch! You're fucking dead!

1:30:02.161 --> 1:30:04.028
You hear me?
You're fucking dead!

1:30:04.163 --> 1:30:06.532
Yeah, that's right,
you fucking pussy.

1:30:06.665 --> 1:30:08.066
"Best friend"?

1:30:09.134 --> 1:30:11.069
I'm truly touched
by that, man.

1:30:11.203 --> 1:30:14.740
What the...
You're alive?

1:30:14.873 --> 1:30:17.309
Ha, ha, ha!
I'm alive!

1:30:17.443 --> 1:30:20.978
- It was a joke. I was trying to get you out of the house.
- What?

1:30:21.113 --> 1:30:24.216
Yeah, you weren't returning my phone
calls, dude. I just want to talk.

1:30:24.349 --> 1:30:26.452
But, he... he shot you.

1:30:26.585 --> 1:30:29.621
Yeah, that's my buddy Thurston.
He works for the pawn shop.

1:30:29.755 --> 1:30:32.224
I was buying my mom's shit back,
and he got me this movie gun.

1:30:32.357 --> 1:30:34.493
- What movie is it from?
- <i>Ride Along 2.</i>

1:30:34.626 --> 1:30:37.796
- Yeah, 50 bucks. Fucking bang, bang, dude.
- Hundred bucks.

1:30:37.930 --> 1:30:40.199
- You said 50.
- I said a hundred.

1:30:40.332 --> 1:30:43.302
Twenty-five a bullet and 50 for the
gun, that's $100.

1:30:43.435 --> 1:30:46.572
You're a fucking liar!

1:30:46.705 --> 1:30:48.407
- I'm not paying for that.
- Yes, you are.

1:30:48.540 --> 1:30:50.975
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

1:30:51.109 --> 1:30:53.645
What the fuck is going on here?

1:30:54.780 --> 1:30:56.482
Look, man,

1:30:56.615 --> 1:30:58.050
all I cared about

1:30:58.183 --> 1:31:00.619
was you and just
making things right again.

1:31:00.752 --> 1:31:03.455
You lost your fucking mind, Bender?
Get me out of this goddamn chair.

1:31:03.589 --> 1:31:06.925
Dude, with that money,
I could've done anything.

1:31:07.059 --> 1:31:08.827
Got an eight-ball
the size of Nebraska,

1:31:08.961 --> 1:31:13.232
fucked my way through whatever
rogue country this asshole's from,

1:31:13.365 --> 1:31:14.967
but that's not what
was in my heart.

1:31:15.100 --> 1:31:18.604
I felt so bad for you and all
the shit you went through,

1:31:18.737 --> 1:31:21.540
and I just wanted to
get you back on your feet.

1:31:21.673 --> 1:31:22.741
So...

1:31:22.875 --> 1:31:26.411
here's my plan.
Wait for it...

1:31:26.545 --> 1:31:28.680
Boom!

1:31:28.814 --> 1:31:31.149
A scrot-o!

1:31:31.283 --> 1:31:33.752
Fuckin' scrotes!

1:31:33.886 --> 1:31:35.621
I got balls for you!

1:31:35.754 --> 1:31:37.256
Smell it! Smell!

1:31:37.389 --> 1:31:40.759
I got you balls.
Fuck you. I got you balls.

1:31:40.893 --> 1:31:43.695
Fuckin' Sack Nicholson
over here.

1:31:43.829 --> 1:31:47.766
Piercings. One with a tattoo on it.
Look at this guy.

1:31:47.900 --> 1:31:49.768
So many fucking balls, dude.

1:31:49.902 --> 1:31:52.271
And then lo and behold...

1:31:52.404 --> 1:31:56.141
Sheldon, you're back!

1:31:56.275 --> 1:31:58.911
Shel Bell!
You look like Elton John.

1:31:59.044 --> 1:32:01.947
You're fucking back!
Fuck you!

1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:05.117
Look at that shit. Juicy!

1:32:05.250 --> 1:32:08.654
Long live the king!

1:32:20.299 --> 1:32:22.035
Bob's web of lies

1:32:22.167 --> 1:32:24.236
has finally
come home to roost.

1:32:24.369 --> 1:32:26.338
What will happen
to poor Bob?

1:32:29.441 --> 1:32:32.244
I'm free.
And you're fucked.

1:32:36.148 --> 1:32:37.549
It's not gross, all right?
Our buddy just...

1:32:37.683 --> 1:32:40.053
It's a very,
very gross present.

1:32:40.185 --> 1:32:42.220
- It's not gross.
- Why would you get him that?

1:32:42.354 --> 1:32:44.957
It's not gross.

1:32:45.090 --> 1:32:47.192
I was just a little
distracted, um,

1:32:47.326 --> 1:32:50.862
planning my speech
for the Oscars.

1:32:53.231 --> 1:32:56.735
What the fuck is that thing?
Fucking cat?

1:33:00.039 --> 1:33:03.408
You need the Heimlich, dude?
You need the Heimlich?

1:33:10.415 --> 1:33:12.985
This is some
jackassery, man.

1:33:13.118 --> 1:33:14.987
Are you fucking
kidding me?

1:33:15.153 --> 1:33:17.756
A baby? A baby here?

1:33:17.889 --> 1:33:20.459
- Yeah, just take a look at the tailbone there.
- No tailbone.

1:33:20.592 --> 1:33:23.395
- That's where I draw the line.
- Come on.

1:33:23.528 --> 1:33:26.932
All right, bend over.

1:33:27.066 --> 1:33:29.301
- Great swimsuit.
- Thank you.

1:33:29.434 --> 1:33:31.169
Can you swim or dive?

1:33:31.303 --> 1:33:32.537
Yeah, both.

1:33:32.671 --> 1:33:34.040
Well, you can dive
on my dick.

1:33:34.172 --> 1:33:36.141
Okay. Okay.

1:33:36.274 --> 1:33:37.776
- Two more. Two more.
- Two more. Two more.

1:33:45.150 --> 1:33:48.620
Filled with jizz!

1:33:52.491 --> 1:33:55.861
Are you just gonna call it?
Okay. Foreground, background...

1:34:03.835 --> 1:34:05.537
My dad likes to buy
his pie at the store.

1:34:05.671 --> 1:34:07.873
Oh, yeah.
Store pie's better.

1:34:08.006 --> 1:34:09.374
Oh, God.

1:34:09.508 --> 1:34:11.077
What's the matter
with your woman?

1:34:11.209 --> 1:34:12.911
Is she always
like this?

1:34:13.845 --> 1:34:16.181
I think she's been
drinking this morning.

1:34:16.314 --> 1:34:18.183
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:34:19.918 --> 1:34:22.454
Motherfucker!

1:34:22.587 --> 1:34:24.189
Fuck!

1:34:26.224 --> 1:34:28.061
- I'm so sorry.
- On frame, right?

1:34:28.193 --> 1:34:32.264
You became a friar.
That's dope, right? That is so rad.

1:34:32.397 --> 1:34:35.901
- Listen to Lance Bass over here.
- Oh, shit!

1:34:40.672 --> 1:34:42.240
Oh!

1:34:47.146 --> 1:34:48.246
What?

1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:50.849
Thanks, Prick Moranis.

1:34:53.018 --> 1:34:55.654
Let's play some
Buddy Games!

1:34:55.787 --> 1:34:57.956
Let's play some
"Bloody" Games!

1:34:58.091 --> 1:34:59.825
No!

1:35:06.732 --> 1:35:09.234
Get it.
Get it. Get it.

1:35:15.507 --> 1:35:18.044
The, uh,
the parking brake wasn't set,

1:35:18.177 --> 1:35:19.978
so it just started
rolling back.

1:36:23.341 --> 1:36:25.877
