WEBVTT

00:05.471 --> 00:10.501
DWIGHT: Uh-oh. Okay,
okay, nobody panic.
Listen up, listen up.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.239
Everyone,
follow me to the shelter.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.679
We've got enough
food for 14 days.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.240
After that, we have
a difficult conversation.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.341
My bad.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.387
Space heater and
fan were both on high,

00:20.454 --> 00:22.855
plugged into
the same outlet, so...

00:23.357 --> 00:25.087
JIM: It's saying
the server went down?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.285
Does anybody
know that password?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.488
'Cause otherwise,
we can't do any work.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.054
Uh, try "password."

00:31.164 --> 00:32.188
Nope.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.566
Try zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero.

00:35.969 --> 00:36.959
No.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.940
Okay, now try zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, one.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.808
Okay, I'm not
doing every number.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.368
Wait, does anyone
remember when
it was set up?

00:45.512 --> 00:47.606
Uh, it was, like,
eight years ago?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.372
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> stuff?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.044
I don't know,
I'm just trying
to think of things

00:51.118 --> 00:52.882
that were happening
at the time.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.546
Everyone was getting
their driver's license.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.651
Why don't we just
call the I.T. guy
who set it up?

00:57.724 --> 00:59.090
What's the name of the guy
in the glasses, again?

00:59.159 --> 01:01.993
Okay, moving backwards,
our I.T. guys have been

01:02.329 --> 01:05.060
"Glasses," "Turban,"
"Ear Hair," "Fatty 3,"

01:05.132 --> 01:08.125
"Shorts," "Fatty 2,"
"Lozenge" and "Fatso."

01:08.602 --> 01:11.071
I think "Lozenge"
is the one
who installed it.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.128
ANDY: I got it.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.262
Try...

01:16.410 --> 01:18.345
You know what,
it made me laugh
when I heard it,

01:18.412 --> 01:20.404
but Pam got
really offended.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.244
"Big boobs."

01:22.749 --> 01:24.581
"Drama queen"?
"Nosy"?

01:25.786 --> 01:26.981
You're typing
"big boobs"?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.110
I'm trying everything.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.315
Try "big boobs"
with a "z."

01:29.556 --> 01:32.390
That's the password.
We're in.

01:32.459 --> 01:33.586
DWIGHT: All right.
Wow.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.390
DWIGHT: Yes.
The important thing is

01:35.462 --> 01:37.522
this kept us secure, people.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.760 --> 02:08.524
Morning.
RYAN: How's it going?

02:10.396 --> 02:11.888
Hey, I'm Wuphf.
I'm Facebook.

02:11.965 --> 02:12.955
What's up, Facebook?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.399
I sent you
a Facebook
message yesterday,

02:14.468 --> 02:15.959
I still haven't
heard anything back.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.766
You should've
sent me a wuphf.
A what?

02:17.838 --> 02:20.069
When you send a wuphf,
it goes to your
home phone, cell phone,

02:20.140 --> 02:22.234
email, Facebook,
Twitter, and homescreen.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.299
All at the same time.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.172
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Wuphf.</i>

02:27.247 --> 02:29.182
Wuphf!
Wuphf.com!

02:36.023 --> 02:37.491
Thanks, Erin.
Sure.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.724
Hey, Pam. I don't
wanna be a lousy snitch.

02:43.463 --> 02:44.453
Okay.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.932
Ryan has been
using the color printer
for his business a lot,

02:47.000 --> 02:47.990
and as office
administrator...

02:48.068 --> 02:49.058
Oh, it's okay.

02:49.569 --> 02:50.832
But it's not for...

02:50.904 --> 02:52.099
Let it go.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.970
PAM: <i>Yes, I invested</i>
<i>in Wuphf.</i>

02:54.107 --> 02:55.473
It's actually
a really great idea,

02:55.542 --> 02:57.602
and I can't believe
it didn't exist before.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.342
And I know Ryan's
kind of a sketchy guy,
but hey, I married Jim.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.476
I've done my part
for the nice guy.
Now I want a bedroom set.

03:04.751 --> 03:09.155
I think an investors'
ski trip, frankly,
is the best idea.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.054
It will be
a bonding experience.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.114
I love it.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.455
I was looking
at a trail map,

03:13.527 --> 03:15.428
and I was thinking
that we should start
on a bunny hill,

03:15.495 --> 03:17.157
because I've never
actually been skiing.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.965
And then work our
way up to "Death Drop."

03:21.168 --> 03:24.036
Great,
so we got our first offer
to buy the company.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.161
You're kidding.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.673
We could sell,
but why think so small?

03:28.075 --> 03:29.873
We can just get
a couple more
people involved,

03:29.943 --> 03:31.206
really do this
thing our way.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.437
You and me, baby.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.811
New investors are key,
though. That's actually
why I came in today.

03:35.816 --> 03:36.909
Don't you work
here full-time?

03:37.384 --> 03:40.013
 Today, I was
thinking I would sit down
with a few of the people

03:40.087 --> 03:41.555
who haven't invested yet.

03:41.621 --> 03:44.455
Or we could do that
together, if that
sounds fun to you.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.883
That does sound fun to me.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.984
Awesome.

03:50.230 --> 03:55.760
Oh, this is good hay. Yeah.
This is the good stuff.
Mattress quality.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.270
Every fall,
growing up,

03:57.337 --> 03:59.829
my Uncle Eldred
used to build us a maze
out of hay bales

03:59.906 --> 04:03.274
for us kids to play in.
We called it "Hay Place."

04:03.777 --> 04:05.541
<i>Eldred called it</i>
<i>"Hay World."</i>

04:05.612 --> 04:07.478
<i>Eventually, lawyers</i>
<i>were brought in. But...</i>

04:08.048 --> 04:12.110
That's all behind us.
Hay Place lives on.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.175
Watch it, watch it.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.654
Hello!
Welcome to Hay Place.
A place for hay.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.055
Don't forget
to make a broom.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.856
Oh, the petting zoo
closes at 2:00,

04:20.927 --> 04:23.123
and the goat roast
is at 3:00.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.528
Come on in, enjoy!

04:24.798 --> 04:25.788
Hey.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.230
I'm kind of in the mood
for a roll in the hay.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.861
Roll in the hay, $5.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.734
No, I meant...

04:34.574 --> 04:36.065
Oh, our contract.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.199
Mmm-hmm.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.546
Yes, why don't we
meet at the usual spot.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.844
Uh, I've got a half
an hour during lunch

04:43.917 --> 04:46.614
in between the historical
reenactment of the
Dunmore farm slaughters

04:46.686 --> 04:47.813
and the onion boil.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.953
Perfect.
So... Excuse me,
get off of there.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.389
Those are show bales,
not play bales.

04:53.493 --> 04:56.793
All right, thank you.
I will send the
contracts over right away.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.229
All right.

05:03.436 --> 05:04.631
Whoo!

05:04.704 --> 05:06.866
JIM: <i>I am on the first hot</i>
<i>sales streak of my life.</i>

05:07.007 --> 05:08.635
I think it all comes
from feeding Cece,

05:08.708 --> 05:11.234
because no matter
how much she resists,

05:11.311 --> 05:13.371
I sell her
those carrots.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.436
And let's be honest,

05:14.514 --> 05:17.416
if I can make mushed carrots
seem better than a boob,

05:17.684 --> 05:20.085
I can pretty much
sell anything.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.282
Commission comes out to

05:24.624 --> 05:25.717
zero.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.693
Okay, well, it can't
be zero, Kev.

05:27.761 --> 05:32.699
I entered the sale,
and I hit enter and I
said, "Dunh-duh-na-dah!"

05:33.433 --> 05:35.163
I'm pretty sure
I timesed it right.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.999
You met your
commission cap
last week.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.006
So, from here until
the end of the fiscal year,
your commission will be zero.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.401
What are you talking about?
We have a commission cap?

05:42.609 --> 05:43.838
It's a new
corporate policy.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.776
Is this job really
about the money
for you, Jim?

05:50.116 --> 05:52.176
I mean, isn't this
where you fell in love?

05:52.252 --> 05:54.744
A commission cap
takes away my
incentive to sell.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.086
So, you realize
I now have no
reason to work, right?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.822
When you're dealing
with a large organization,

05:59.893 --> 06:03.227
sometimes you have to
put up with policies
you don't like.

06:03.296 --> 06:07.028
I wish my gym
didn't allow full nudity
in the locker room.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.428
Okay, some of
these old guys
walking around naked,

06:10.070 --> 06:11.561
feels almost
passive-aggressive.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.564
But I deal with it
'cause it's policy.
See what I mean?

06:14.808 --> 06:15.798
Nope.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.538
Nudity makes me
uncomfortable.
Okay.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.512
My gym allows it.

06:19.579 --> 06:23.482
I wish they didn't,
but it's policy. So,
I respect it, and I just

06:23.550 --> 06:25.041
keep a low...
You know, I look away.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.385
Think about your
commission cap

06:28.455 --> 06:30.117
as a naked old man
in a gym locker room.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.753
Excuse me,
everyone. Sex!

06:36.463 --> 06:37.863
Now that I have
your attention...

06:37.964 --> 06:39.489
You don't have
our attention.

06:39.599 --> 06:40.589
Money!

06:40.700 --> 06:41.690
I'm listening.

06:41.768 --> 06:42.963
You had me at "sex."

06:43.270 --> 06:44.795
Pervert.
PHYLLIS: You have
all of our attention

06:44.871 --> 06:46.237
just by screaming anything.

06:46.539 --> 06:47.529
That's good to know.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.973
What do you want
to say, Michael?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.136
Wuphf!

06:52.212 --> 06:54.374
All right,
I've warmed them up for you.
You have the floor, Ryan.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.875
How's everybody doing?

06:57.550 --> 06:58.540
RYAN: Good!

06:58.618 --> 07:00.246
Now, a lot of you
have already staked out

07:00.320 --> 07:01.788
your corner of
the Wuphf empire.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.222
Raise your hand if
I'm describing you.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.650
Great.

07:07.827 --> 07:09.022
STANLEY: <i>Yes, I have a dream.</i>

07:09.195 --> 07:13.030
And it's not some M.L.K.
dream for equality.

07:13.099 --> 07:17.195
I want to own
a decommissioned
lighthouse.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.430
And I want to
live at the top.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.032
And nobody knows
I live there.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.772
And there's a button
that I can press,

07:25.845 --> 07:29.213
and launch that
lighthouse into space.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.780
For my current investors,
things are going great.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.114
We already
have a buyer.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.176
Really? Who?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.552
Washington University.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.282
I don't even want to
think about selling

07:37.357 --> 07:38.882
until our numbers
get into the billions.

07:38.959 --> 07:39.949
At least.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.996
So, I've decided
to open up a second
round of investment

07:43.063 --> 07:44.827
to friends and family.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.025
Oh, God. Hold on to
your wallets, ladies.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.627
Did you ever think of
Wuphf as an emergency
notification system,

07:50.704 --> 07:52.866
like, for college campuses
with shooters or gas leaks?

07:53.039 --> 07:56.373
No, no, Oscar, it's not
a digital rape whistle.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.105
Wuphf is about fun.
That's right.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.976
Fun, communication,
connection.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.439
What's your
money situation?

08:01.581 --> 08:03.447
Well, it's tight,
as with any start-up.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.747
Sure, how long can you
sustain this without
a cash infusion?

08:05.819 --> 08:09.153
We have nine solid days.
I love these questions.
Keep 'em coming.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.316
I'm sorry,
nine days until what?

08:11.391 --> 08:12.381
Bankruptcy?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.428
Wait, Ryan,
so this could be
over by the weekend?

08:15.595 --> 08:17.291
How long do you
think a week is?

08:17.364 --> 08:19.128
No, not this weekend.
Next weekend.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.758
We were gonna go on
the investors' ski trip.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.703
I bought poles.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.239
JIM: <i>Well, since I have</i>
<i>no incentive to sell,</i>

08:30.310 --> 08:34.246
<i>I've cleaned my car,</i>
<i>organized my desk,</i>
<i>and taken a multivitamin.</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:35.746
<i>So...</i>

08:36.482 --> 08:37.576
What now?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.679
Pam.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.023
Okay, now I've tried
everything.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.259
Did you prank Dwight?
No.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.419
Well, you like that.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.759
Yeah, it's not
as fun if I'm not
blowing off work.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.525
I love you,
but I'm kind of busy,

08:51.598 --> 08:54.500
so I need you to
figure this one
out on your own.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.813
Oscar said Wuphf
only has enough money
for nine days.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.711
Check this out.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.511
All that color.
MICHAEL: Look at that.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.883
Triple your
investment by January.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.218
Anyone can just
throw numbers up
on a chart.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.518
What are you doing
to make it happen?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.717
Well, earlier today,
I was emailing someone
by the name of John Legend.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.228
MICHAEL: There you go.
You have his email?

09:22.295 --> 09:25.891
A lot of these
guys are just Mac.com
at their website whatever.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.627
We get that guy wuphfing,

09:27.867 --> 09:28.857
it's all over.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.233
I want my money back.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.067
Do not talk
like that, Stanley.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.039
Ryan, just tell
us your plan.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.811
Okay, all right.
I know what you wanna see.
I'll be right back.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.613
Hey, kids,
was that fun?

09:46.686 --> 09:47.676
ALL: Yeah!
All right.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.517
I wanna go
on it again.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.955
Oh, I bet you do.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.181
You know what?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.523
When I was a little kid,
they couldn't get
me off the hayride.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.028
But it's gonna cost
you three more bucks.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.397
Wow! This brings
back memories.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.027
Hay stacking,
hay throwing...

10:03.103 --> 10:07.541
And at the end of it all,
one lucky boy would
be crowned hay king.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.441
I always wanted
to be hay king.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.240
But the world
shines on Mose.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.348
Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.053
Can we move this to
the end of the day?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.884
No, I think you should
make time for it.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.516
I found the needle
in the haystack!

10:25.592 --> 10:27.857
Hey, congratulations.
Do you know
what your prize is?

10:27.927 --> 10:28.917
I don't know.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.499
Nothing. Life lesson?
Some tasks are
not worth doing.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.623
Dwight?

10:35.201 --> 10:37.761
Wuphf T-shirts.
Who wants one?

10:37.837 --> 10:40.033
Just imagine that
you're at spring
break at Daytona Beach.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.096
Here we go.
Okay?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.733
Everyone's like,
"Hey, dude, what's up

10:42.809 --> 10:45.005
"with all the hotties
in the Wuphf shirts?"

10:45.111 --> 10:47.706
Or, "Hey, what's up
with that helicopter?"

10:48.214 --> 10:49.307
"It's Ry from Wuphf!"

10:49.382 --> 10:50.406
"It's Ry,
the Wuphf guy!"

10:50.483 --> 10:51.542
"Yo, Ry from Wuphf!"

10:51.618 --> 10:53.109
"He's up there."
"What's he dropping?"

10:53.186 --> 10:54.882
"Wow, what's falling
on us, man?"

10:55.054 --> 10:56.352
Wuphf condoms!

10:56.656 --> 10:58.352
Fifty thousand condoms
out of the sky.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.414
MICHAEL: Look at that!

10:59.492 --> 11:00.585
He threw 'em
on the ground!

11:00.660 --> 11:03.459
Look, this is
a marketing campaign.
You got nine days.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.691
Let's say you
do get the money.

11:04.764 --> 11:05.754
What are you
gonna do with it?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.494
The first lesson of
Silicon Valley, actually,

11:07.567 --> 11:10.503
is that you only
think about the user,
the experience.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.096
You actually don't
think about the money.
Ever.

11:13.573 --> 11:14.700
That sounds weird.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.367
No, it's not weird,
Andy, and you
know what else?

11:17.443 --> 11:19.742
We have an offer from
Washington University.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.178
So, monetize that.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.239
Are you guys
meeting about Wuphf?

11:23.316 --> 11:25.444
You know that that
was my idea, right?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.077
I said to Ryan,
"I try to call you,

11:27.153 --> 11:28.143
"and you don't
have your phone.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.689
"I try to I.M. you,
and you're not online.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.850
"I wish there was
a way that I could do
everything all at once,

11:31.925 --> 11:33.223
"and I could
just be like this
little dog going,

11:33.293 --> 11:34.818
"'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Ruff! Ruff!'"

11:34.894 --> 11:36.157
RYAN: Baby, baby, baby...
KELLY: I think
I'm gonna sue you.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.219
No, no, no.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.356
I do, I do.
This isn't right.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.332
I help you with your
things, and you help
me with my things.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.866
KELLY: But I...
It's not right.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.960
I got this. It's okay.
Don't worry about this.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.638
Is it any particular branch
of Washington University?

11:46.739 --> 11:48.833
The Washington University
Public Health Fund.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.245
W-U-P-H-F.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.302
Oh, God.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.813
They only want it
for the initials.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.542
The domain name.
Yeah, they do.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.982
I move we sell.
MICHAEL: What?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.519
Yeah, sell.
Sell.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.576
Get us out of this.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.121
Have some faith
in this idea.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.815
If everybody
wants to sell,
we sell, right?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.121
I won't sell.
And you know what?

12:06.192 --> 12:08.855
Ryan and I have
the majority of shares.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.760
Isn't that right?
Yes. You alone do, actually.

12:10.830 --> 12:11.820
I... Yes.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.121
We're not selling.

12:13.199 --> 12:14.963
I will not sell.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.598
Awesome.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.433
Do you mind if we
share this bale?

12:24.510 --> 12:25.671
Sure.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.873
There's no charge
to sit on the hay,
is there?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.510
Probably.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.246
I mean,
wouldn't you think

12:31.317 --> 12:34.014
the $10 to
build your own broom
would include the hay

12:34.087 --> 12:35.350
and not just
the instructions?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.411
I mean,
I'm starting to think

12:36.489 --> 12:38.082
this guy is just
trying to make money
off the holiday.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.722
Yeah, instead of
"Hay Place" it should
be "Pay Place."

12:41.861 --> 12:42.851
Don't laugh at me.

12:43.062 --> 12:45.793
No, no, no, I wasn't.
I was just laughing
at your joke.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.590
Oh.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.431
"Pay Place."

12:51.504 --> 12:55.942
Yeah, so we can celebrate
"Thanksgiving-me-your-money"
Day.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.102
That's humorous.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.166
Thank you.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.375
KEVIN: You guys know
how to get out?

13:07.620 --> 13:08.610
Hi, Michael.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.554
Can't talk,
saving the planet.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.056
Oh, we don't recycle.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.552
We don't?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.959
Well, why have I been
separating the trash
into whites and colors?

13:16.162 --> 13:17.721
I'm sure no one
asked you to do that.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.834
Eight years.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.161
Listen, I know you
really like Ryan...

13:25.238 --> 13:26.934
No, I won't
even consider it.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.903
Michael, I...

13:30.143 --> 13:32.738
I hate to say
this, but...

13:32.812 --> 13:36.442
You know this special
bond that you've
always felt with Ryan,

13:36.516 --> 13:37.984
where, like,
you're best friends

13:38.051 --> 13:39.610
or you're his
mentor or something?

13:39.686 --> 13:43.680
Right, yes, yeah.
Best friend/mentor.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.089
Michael, I think
that that feeling
only goes one way.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.154
And I think that
Ryan knows that,

13:51.230 --> 13:52.664
and he's taking
advantage of you.

13:55.601 --> 13:56.728
I think you are wrong.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.930
And there are
a lot of other people

13:59.005 --> 14:02.066
in this office who
have money at stake.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.507
Other people
you care about.

14:07.814 --> 14:12.445
You may be right.
I may be crazy.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.644
Don't.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.756
I'm just saying that
I think I agree
with your point.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.652
Yeah, but in a jokey way
where you're
gonna start singing.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.092
I thought it might
make me feel better.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.063
Okay. Go ahead.

14:28.067 --> 14:32.437
 <i>But it just</i>
<i>may be a lunatic</i>

14:32.505 --> 14:33.871
No.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.406
Ooh, nice.
Wasting time,
here we go.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.379
Hey, back off.
It's solitaire.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.337
Hey, kid.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.106
Hear you're
looking for work.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.173
Talk to me.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.776
How far can you
reach those lovely
long arms of yours?

14:49.288 --> 14:50.278
Put 'em down.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.588
How long can you hold
that pretty little
breath of yours?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.051
Good.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.829
Hey, Jim?

14:58.931 --> 15:00.399
Are you distracting
these people?

15:00.466 --> 15:01.456
CREED: We're working.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.338
Can you at least
try to look busy?

15:07.306 --> 15:09.172
JO: <i>The moment Darla</i>
<i>put the cupcake</i>
<i>in her mouth,</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:10.801
<i>her daddy pulled</i>
<i>her aside and said,</i>

15:10.877 --> 15:14.746
<i>"You're too fat.</i>
<i>No one's gonna like</i>
<i>you if you're too fat."</i>

15:16.883 --> 15:19.978
<i>The next time I</i>
<i>saw David Geffen</i>
<i>was at the Buffalo Club.</i>

15:20.086 --> 15:23.579
<i>"I love you,</i>
<i>you gay bastard," I said.</i>

15:23.656 --> 15:25.352
<i>"You gay bastard," I...</i>

15:25.792 --> 15:26.782
<i>Gay ba...</i>

15:27.460 --> 15:28.689
<i>Gay...</i>

15:32.799 --> 15:33.960
Michael,

15:34.033 --> 15:35.592
how's it going, bro?
Good, good, bro.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.569
Hey, thanks so much
for having my back
out there.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.128
Always have your back.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.935
So, any ideas on how
we can get over this
nine-day hump here?

15:42.008 --> 15:45.672
I have nothing but
ideas. The thing is,
they all require money.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.542
Nine days, though.
That's, like...

15:47.613 --> 15:49.946
Look, I know I've
tapped you so hard.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.084
Yes, you have tapped this.
Hard.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.952
You are funny, Michael.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.023
You... People don't
give you enough credit.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.352
Maybe I could take
a second mortgage
on my condo.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.193
Well, a lot of
people are doing that,

16:01.260 --> 16:02.694
and there don't seem
to be any consequences.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.288
And they say the rates
have never been lower.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.163
So, you would think
that's a good
idea for me to do?

16:08.301 --> 16:12.170
Think about this,
you and me on
our private plane,

16:12.572 --> 16:14.302
flown by our
private pilot,

16:14.373 --> 16:17.707
eating our private meal,
cooked by our private chef.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.678
Yeah, well, we never even
have dinner now, so...

16:19.812 --> 16:20.802
We totally should.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.904
Tonight?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.374
I gotta work on this.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.248
Right.
What am I saying?
Rain check.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.947
Yeah.

16:30.089 --> 16:35.323
<i>And now, by show of</i>
<i>applause, we will crown</i>
<i>this year's hay king.</i>

16:35.428 --> 16:38.193
<i>All in favor</i>
<i>of Purebred.</i>

16:38.831 --> 16:40.197
<i>Put your hands</i>
<i>together for</i>

16:40.399 --> 16:41.731
<i>Mixed Bred.</i>

16:42.869 --> 16:44.235
<i>And let's hear it for</i>

16:44.504 --> 16:45.802
<i>Purebred.</i>

16:47.707 --> 16:49.767
<i>We appear to</i>
<i>have a three-way tie.</i>

16:49.842 --> 16:53.176
<i>I have no choice</i>
<i>but to pick</i>
<i>the hay king myself.</i>

16:53.312 --> 16:54.541
<i>I pick...</i>

16:56.616 --> 16:59.711
<i>Me! I am your hay king!</i>

17:00.419 --> 17:03.014
<i>All hail your hay king!</i>

17:06.025 --> 17:08.858
Did I truck 300 bales
of hay to a parking lot

17:08.928 --> 17:11.454
to rectify some
childhood disappointment?

17:13.299 --> 17:14.358
Yes.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.229
So, if I were to
call Dunder Mifflin

17:16.301 --> 17:18.294
and ask for
Miss Angela Martin,

17:19.872 --> 17:20.862
would I get
through to you?

17:22.340 --> 17:23.832
You would.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.141
And if I were to
call your house
and ask for your wife,

17:26.212 --> 17:27.271
would I get
through to you?

17:28.247 --> 17:30.375
My wife passed away
a few years ago.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.414
How tragic.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.851
Very sorry to hear that.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.910
Thank you.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.592
KEVIN: Help! Hello?

17:41.627 --> 17:44.153
Oh! Help!

17:48.134 --> 17:50.433
Consider it
a wuphf in person.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.835
You're doing
the wrong thing.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.135
You're gonna lose
Michael's investment,
you're gonna lose ours.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.698
You got this crazy
opportunity to get
our money back.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.136
Tell Mike to sell.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.179
If you tell Michael
to sell, he'll sell.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.337
I'm betting on myself.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.746
It's a bad bet.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.806
Hello?

18:05.351 --> 18:07.217
Hey. It's an ambush here.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.777
Nobody here
believes in
this company.

18:08.854 --> 18:09.878
Will you tell
them they're wrong?

18:10.122 --> 18:11.351
It's not that
we don't believe
in the company.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.517
We don't
believe in you.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.184
All those in favor
of selling, say "aye."

18:14.427 --> 18:15.793
Aye.
Aye.

18:15.861 --> 18:16.851
Aye.
Aye.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.824
Aye.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.265
Do not agree to sell,
which is to say nay.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.865
What is wrong with you?
What happened to
you in high school?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.135
Michael, are
you that blind?

18:29.275 --> 18:32.040
I'm not blind!
I know exactly who he is.

18:32.111 --> 18:36.674
He is selfish and
lazy and image-obsessed,
and he is a bad friend.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.019
And he's also clever.

18:41.087 --> 18:44.751
And he shoots
incredibly high, and
he may just make it.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.456
But you know what,
even if he doesn't,

18:46.525 --> 18:49.654
I would rather
go broke betting
on my people

18:49.729 --> 18:53.825
than get rich all by
myself on some island
like a castaway.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.333
And there is
no middle ground.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.563
You're gonna lose
all of our money.

18:57.770 --> 19:02.208
Only if he fails.
And you know what?
Ryan, I believe in you,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.770
just like I believe
in all of you.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.342
You have nine days
to save everybody's money.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.142
Oh, that's a lot
of pressure.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.050
I'm gonna need
some more time.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.514
You can't have it.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.385
Okay.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.751
I won't let you down.

19:29.568 --> 19:33.005
Angela? Angela!

19:42.548 --> 19:46.076
The world sends
people your way...

19:46.152 --> 19:51.318
Ryan came to me
through a temp agency.
Andy was transferred here.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.859
No idea where
Creed came from.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.323
The point is you
just have to play

19:55.394 --> 19:57.556
with the cards
that you're dealt.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.687
Jim,

19:58.998 --> 20:00.364
<i>that guy is an ace.</i>

20:00.433 --> 20:03.494
<i>Dwight is my</i>
<i>king up my sleeve.</i>
<i>Phyllis is my old maid.</i>

20:03.569 --> 20:04.867
<i>Oscar is my queen.</i>

20:04.937 --> 20:09.136
That's easy.
Give me a hard one.
That's what Oscar said.

20:09.408 --> 20:12.173
<i>Toby is the instruction</i>
<i>card you throw away.</i>

20:12.244 --> 20:13.803
<i>Pam is a solid seven.</i>

20:13.879 --> 20:16.678
<i>And yeah, you know what?</i>
<i>Ryan is probably, like, a two.</i>

20:16.749 --> 20:19.844
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>twos can be wild,</i>
<i>so watch out.</i>

20:20.052 --> 20:23.250
And I am obviously
the joker, so...

20:25.858 --> 20:26.848
That's...

20:28.260 --> 20:32.095
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Wuphf from Ryan Howard.</i>
<i>Decided to sell company.</i>

20:32.164 --> 20:34.690
<i>Thanks, bro.</i>
<i>Hell of a ride.</i>

20:34.767 --> 20:36.292
Thank God.

20:46.445 --> 20:47.435
Gabe Lewis.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.443
JO: <i>Now, listen here,</i>
<i>Gabe, you're too fat.</i>

20:50.516 --> 20:52.644
<i>No one's gonna like</i>
<i>you if you're too fat.</i>

20:52.718 --> 20:55.745
<i>I made some</i>
<i>changes to my book.</i>
<i>See if you like them.</i>

20:55.821 --> 20:57.722
Well, Jo...
<i>Now, I love reading,</i>

20:57.790 --> 20:59.122
<i>and I hate being</i>
<i>interrupted.</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:01.921
<i>Shut up and listen,</i>
<i>you gay bastard.</i>

21:01.994 --> 21:06.261
<i>Chapter one. I was born,</i>
<i>not into luxury nor poverty,</i>

21:06.332 --> 21:09.097
<i>but into adversity,</i>
<i>and for that,</i>
<i>I thank the Lord.</i>

21:09.168 --> 21:11.228
<i>My father was a man.</i>
<i>That's all we can know.</i>

21:11.303 --> 21:14.296
<i>After I learned</i>
<i>to ride a bike,</i>
<i>there was no stopping me.</i>

21:14.373 --> 21:17.309
<i>I would ride up</i>
<i>Magnolia Street</i>
<i>and down Azalea Lane,</i>

21:17.376 --> 21:18.708
<i>which would later</i>
<i>become my paper route...</i>

21:18.778 --> 21:19.837
All right,
good night, Gabe.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.244
Just wanted to
say thanks again

21:21.313 --> 21:22.804
'cause I really
think I made
good use of my day.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.680
<i>...wherever I wanted.</i>

21:24.750 --> 21:26.480
<i>I have always</i>
<i>been a fighter.</i>
Sorry.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.722
<i>And fate has obliged me</i>
<i>with plenty of battles,</i>

21:29.789 --> 21:30.848
<i>the first being a hard...</i>
