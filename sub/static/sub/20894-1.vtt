02:19.070 --> 02:21.360
I'm closed.

02:24.490 --> 02:27.050
I said I'm closed for the night.

06:01.290 --> 06:02.700
Help!

06:26.790 --> 06:29.420
23 YEARS LATER

07:51.690 --> 07:53.070
Roman?

08:08.960 --> 08:12.000
- Roman?
- Helen!

08:14.550 --> 08:17.300
- Always so prompt.
- Roman.

08:17.880 --> 08:22.860
You know? You do not always need
to order a package just to see me.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.830
I know.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.700
You need to sign for this.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.340
It's your birthday.

08:42.549 --> 08:43.989
I painted something for you.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.810
You might like it, considering
your artistic eye.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.370
- Who is it?
- It's you.

09:00.090 --> 09:01.740
It doesn't look like me.

09:02.330 --> 09:06.270
How you see yourself is not
necessarily how others see you.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.910
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- Just you.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.410
I can't.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.710
Did I do something wrong?

09:29.460 --> 09:30.640
No...

09:31.110 --> 09:33.640
Roman, I'm sorry, it's not you.
I can't.

09:35.420 --> 09:36.650
It's fine.

09:43.510 --> 09:47.090
When you do figure out what you want,
you know where to find me.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.760
- This is weird.
- What's weird?

10:04.530 --> 10:06.090
It's you?

10:07.670 --> 10:09.170
That is not you.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.050
It's not me.

10:17.990 --> 10:20.570
This place is so creepy.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.870
- What?
- It's morbid.

10:27.890 --> 10:31.379
Sitting outside the room where your
mother killed herself 23 years ago?

10:31.380 --> 10:33.390
I'm sorry, but it is.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.240
Here.

10:43.030 --> 10:46.090
What is this?
It's your birthday.

10:46.330 --> 10:49.930
- I'm suppose to get you a gift.
- Open it.

10:52.710 --> 10:54.420
Oh my God!

10:54.960 --> 10:57.430
I thought I lost this.

10:57.750 --> 11:01.980
I stole it... one night on a sleepover.

11:02.170 --> 11:04.890
- Why?
- I don't know.

11:05.810 --> 11:11.600
Maybe I was jealous. Your stuff.
Of your family.

11:14.230 --> 11:17.130
I forgot, okay?
I was eleven.

11:18.930 --> 11:23.780
Anyway, just going through a box
of old stuff. I wanted to make amends.

11:33.330 --> 11:38.234
I never had a home.
And... this place is...

11:40.290 --> 11:47.970
I don't know. It's... a memory...
I feel safe, or something. I don't know.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.670
Safe?

11:54.350 --> 11:56.110
I love you.

11:57.690 --> 12:00.970
And I'm sorry that your mum
killed herself in a shitty motel.

12:03.730 --> 12:08.150
- What if I'm just like her?
- Helen! It doesn't work like that.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.410
Whatever dark shit was inside of her...

12:11.710 --> 12:13.730
...is not in you.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.490
I would know.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.270
Powers of observation are that keen, huh?

12:23.650 --> 12:27.650
I'm an actress. Empathy
is my greatest talent.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.090
And blowjobs.

12:34.430 --> 12:39.980
Speaking of. Ed's texting.
He needs me.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.370
I have to go rehearse.

12:45.030 --> 12:48.490
Is it good? Your play?

12:49.490 --> 12:53.660
Ed's a genius. And I'm his muse.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.950
Of course I paid for it,
so it'd better be.

12:57.040 --> 13:01.670
- You know what? I am gonna take this.
- Molly...

13:01.710 --> 13:04.590
Maybe you'll be famous like me one day.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.920
Helen, wake up, wake up, wake up.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.350
Helen has sustained a major head injury.

14:20.040 --> 14:26.540
We don't know how extensive the damage is,
how long it will take to get better, and...

14:26.630 --> 14:29.940
how it will impact Helen's day to day life.

14:30.340 --> 14:34.742
There is no way to know how the
damage is going to manifest itself.

14:52.490 --> 14:56.410
It's okay. You're young.
Bones heal fast.

14:56.470 --> 15:00.830
Doctor say it will just be a couple
of weeks and it will be back to normal.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.120
Welcome home HELEN.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.890
Are you coming? I mean this is
your party, as in it's for you.

16:02.390 --> 16:05.990
- Just give me a minute, okay?
- Okay.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.270
You know? Her
remind that painting.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.940
Helen?

17:23.770 --> 17:26.599
- You must be Ed.
- You must be Helen.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.530
The Helen, Molly's always talking about.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.400
Yeah, that's me.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.569
You're prettier than I thought you'd be.

17:36.570 --> 17:40.630
You're pretty much exactly
how I thought you'd be.

17:46.020 --> 17:49.890
- Want some?
- I'm good. Thanks.

17:54.750 --> 17:58.880
And so it goes, go go...

17:58.960 --> 18:01.340
and where it ends is fate.

18:02.010 --> 18:08.600
And neither by singeing of flesh...
nor tipping of cups of wine...

18:09.730 --> 18:15.730
...or shedding of burning tears
can you enchant away the rigids...

18:15.810 --> 18:18.780
Yay!

19:05.030 --> 19:06.590
Sleep.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.160
Wake up!

19:33.270 --> 19:34.059
Molly? Hello?

19:34.060 --> 19:37.482
Girl when you fall, you fall hard.
Talk about rollovers...

19:37.483 --> 19:40.460
- How did I get here?
- Get where?

19:41.440 --> 19:45.000
On my bike...
I'm in a parking garage.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.910
I don't even know how you made it to
work, after who you were with last night.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.020
Molly!

19:51.240 --> 19:54.360
- How did I get here?
- What...? Helen, Jesus!

19:54.440 --> 19:57.450
Haven't you had coffee yet? You left
this morning. We heard you leave.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.390
That's impossible...

19:58.391 --> 20:01.450
I have to go, I have rehearsal.
Drink lots of water. Love ya.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.570
KILL HIM

22:26.900 --> 22:30.010
Hey, girl! We're doing a full
dress rehearsal tonight at seven.

22:30.110 --> 22:33.320
Whole cast coming over.
Is that okay?

22:33.410 --> 22:37.130
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Okay. Love ya.

23:24.460 --> 23:25.570
Hello?

24:05.160 --> 24:06.290
Helen!

24:16.090 --> 24:18.510
What the fuck, Helen!

24:21.510 --> 24:24.890
What happened to your foot?

24:28.150 --> 24:29.730
Helen?

24:30.980 --> 24:32.440
Helen!

24:37.070 --> 24:40.410
- Helen, let me in!
- Leave me alone!

24:40.490 --> 24:43.600
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. I don't know.

24:43.601 --> 24:45.939
- Where were you?
- I don't remember.

24:45.940 --> 24:49.033
You don't remember walking
around the city with just a towel on?

24:49.034 --> 24:50.299
I don't remember anything!

24:50.600 --> 24:51.700
Think.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.410
I was at the gym...

24:56.320 --> 25:00.430
I was in the locker room and
there was a woman in the shower.

25:01.010 --> 25:05.250
There was a woman in the
women's locker room? Shocking!

25:09.600 --> 25:11.870
I'm sorry I ruined your rehearsal.

25:12.430 --> 25:14.610
You're the most real thing I saw tonight.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.270
Okay. We're getting you
to a doctor tomorrow.

25:23.810 --> 25:26.090
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:33.630 --> 25:34.990
What?!

25:35.770 --> 25:36.990
Nothing.

26:12.980 --> 26:17.490
One minute I'm in one place,
and the next in somewhere else.

26:17.570 --> 26:19.860
Just like in sleepwalking.

26:20.490 --> 26:22.030
Hearing voices?

26:25.430 --> 26:26.610
Yeah.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.200
- Seeing things?
- Like what?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.100
Anything out of the ordinary?

26:34.980 --> 26:38.400
- I don't know.
- Are you?

26:39.940 --> 26:43.330
- Maybe.
- You never told me that.

26:45.220 --> 26:49.430
Okay. Let's talk about your family history.
- I don't want to.

26:49.790 --> 26:52.370
- You don't want to?
- Helen.

26:52.620 --> 26:57.990
- I don't have any family.
- Helen, tell her about your mum.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.050
- What about her?
- I'm not crazy.

27:01.130 --> 27:02.970
No one said you were.

27:03.050 --> 27:07.750
You gonna say that I'm just like my
mom, and I'm telling you, that I'm not.

27:12.540 --> 27:15.570
Do you mind leaving us alone?

27:20.150 --> 27:24.030
- I'll just meet you at home?
- It's okay.

27:24.320 --> 27:28.220
Just call me when you're done, okay?
It's going to be okay.

27:31.790 --> 27:33.810
Okay, how will we do this?

27:33.930 --> 27:36.430
We'll order you a scan, an MRI.

27:36.530 --> 27:40.340
Then we can see what's going on
inside that head of yours, okay?

27:40.590 --> 27:45.010
Just a routine scan. I'm sure
there's nothing to be concerned about.

29:49.710 --> 29:50.820
Helen.

30:19.030 --> 30:21.640
Helen...

30:42.530 --> 30:47.190
Helen? This is Dr.. Headley. You
need to come to the hospital right now.

30:47.530 --> 30:52.130
We've got the images from your MRI scan,
and I think you're gonna want to see this.

30:57.120 --> 31:01.469
This dark shadow, plus the
symptoms you are experiencing,

31:01.470 --> 31:03.250
- indicates...
- A tumor?

31:03.370 --> 31:07.550
Technically, yes.
But this is different, and rare.

31:07.790 --> 31:09.110
See...

31:10.170 --> 31:15.810
This here looks to us like an
undeveloped top portion of a spine.

31:18.390 --> 31:24.150
- How?
- You had or you have a twin.

31:29.280 --> 31:33.470
Have you ever heard of something
called "vanishing twin syndrome"?

31:34.450 --> 31:35.450
No.

31:36.490 --> 31:40.540
Well, I'm not a 100% certain of
this, but if I had money to bet,

31:40.620 --> 31:44.019
I would bet that your mother
got pregnant with twins

31:44.020 --> 31:47.100
and one twin died in utero.

31:47.170 --> 31:52.670
And rather than it being absorbed into your
mother, he or she was absorbed into you.

31:52.760 --> 31:56.010
Into your body.
Into your skull.

31:56.340 --> 31:59.600
And it has been there your entire life.

31:59.680 --> 32:05.060
And it wasn't until your accident that
this mass of genetic material was activated

32:05.140 --> 32:08.390
by chemicals that were
rushed into your head.

32:08.730 --> 32:13.929
These losing time,
lack of inhibition, aggression...

32:13.930 --> 32:16.719
These are all regulated by
your prefrontal cortex.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.549
This is the part of your brain
that makes you... you.

32:19.550 --> 32:22.090
I have a person in my head?!

32:22.240 --> 32:28.020
No, it's not a person. It's just
a mass of genetic material.

32:28.050 --> 32:33.300
But, based on your symptoms it seems
that since your accident, it's growing.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.630
And it's growing at a pace...

32:34.830 --> 32:39.449
that's putting serious pressure
on your brain, and that's not good.

32:39.450 --> 32:41.199
So, what do I do?

32:41.200 --> 32:44.810
Well, I'm gonna book
you in for surgery now.

32:44.980 --> 32:46.550
Surgery?

32:48.270 --> 32:51.089
- I need to think about this.
- Okay.

32:51.090 --> 32:54.820
But this isn't something you'd
tough out and it just goes away.

32:55.150 --> 32:57.840
Let us know.
We'll make the appointment.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.960
- Hello?
- Helen. Let me...

33:49.580 --> 33:51.750
I want it out!

34:06.070 --> 34:07.700
Vanishing Twin.

34:08.730 --> 34:10.839
And how did that feel?

34:10.840 --> 34:15.440
It's weird. Ever since I was a little kid,
I always felt like I was half of something.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.350
And it's not the kind of thing that you
can explain to people. It's like this...

34:19.429 --> 34:22.899
The whole world's a party,
that everybody else was invited to.

34:22.900 --> 34:25.745
And I'm at the party,
but I wasn't invited,

34:25.746 --> 34:28.409
I'm just sort of standing
in a corner by myself,

34:28.560 --> 34:33.130
...invisible, because I never knew
what it felt like to be complete.

34:33.210 --> 34:35.748
Not until they found you had a
brother, you never knew,

34:35.750 --> 34:36.989
in your brain.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.649
Yeah. The thing is...

34:38.650 --> 34:42.590
there is a lot of us out there, and people
think it's about the twin that died

34:42.679 --> 34:47.560
in the womb, you know. But I think
that the ones who are left, the survivors

34:47.639 --> 34:49.600
we are the ones who vanish.

34:49.679 --> 34:52.850
<i>Vanishing twins. This science now...</i>

34:52.940 --> 34:55.659
This feels like there's something
more happening with me.

34:55.659 --> 34:57.469
Not just something you can cut out.

34:57.470 --> 35:01.650
You've just found out you had a twin.
Jesus, let that sink in.

35:01.740 --> 35:03.908
The doctor said it was
pressure on my brain

35:03.920 --> 35:06.200
that's causing these blackouts.
I don't know.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.690
If something feels wrong, you
should go back to the doctor.

35:08.770 --> 35:12.040
- I have to go back soon anyway.
- Well, when is the surgery?

35:12.120 --> 35:16.210
- Three days.
- Three days and this is all over.

35:16.290 --> 35:18.350
You can do that standing on your head.

35:19.960 --> 35:25.180
Plus you're also a badass. Like if
Ripley had a baby with Joan of Arc.

35:28.890 --> 35:31.970
This whole thing is just freaking me out.

35:32.890 --> 35:37.570
She started of in my mum's body
and then... she went into mine.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.270
I just feel so guilty.

35:41.150 --> 35:44.950
Helen, you can't feel
guilty. It's not your fault.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.690
Here.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.530
Thanks.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.530
Okay. Let's get a
picture of the three of us.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.670
Stop!

36:31.100 --> 36:35.390
Okay Helen, I have to go rehearse.
Get some rest. Don't go out.

36:57.060 --> 36:59.400
What the hell...!

37:08.660 --> 37:09.950
Molly?

37:14.040 --> 37:16.970
Molly, did you put the
painting back in there?

37:19.290 --> 37:20.580
Molly!

37:23.550 --> 37:25.610
What the hell?

38:11.340 --> 38:12.930
Roman?

38:13.640 --> 38:16.490
Roman, I brought back
your stupid painting!

38:25.410 --> 38:28.500
<i>...Helen, I want you.</i>

38:28.910 --> 38:33.330
<i>You want something.
Come in. Sit.</i>

38:33.490 --> 38:34.270
Roman?

38:34.271 --> 38:37.340
<i>- Come on Helen.
- Yes.</i>

38:39.210 --> 38:43.630
<i>Helen, listen!
Untie me! Untie me!</i>

38:48.340 --> 38:52.520
<i>I knew you'd come back when you
figure out what you wanted. Come here.</i>

38:52.930 --> 38:59.319
<i>I want to see you. You want
to fuck me, don't you? Say it.</i>

39:01.950 --> 39:03.370
<i>Yes.</i>

39:05.190 --> 39:08.790
<i>Helen, listen!
Untie me! Untie me!</i>

39:14.640 --> 39:18.510
Roman? Where are you?!

41:59.830 --> 42:01.380
<i>I'm coming.</i>

42:15.640 --> 42:20.640
I AM COMING

42:49.130 --> 42:51.680
I've had enough of this shit!

43:22.470 --> 43:24.990
Try it now, you fucking bitch!

43:33.000 --> 43:35.010
Three more days.

43:37.040 --> 43:41.270
Just keep it together for
three goddam more days.

43:57.270 --> 44:00.090
<i>- Where are we going?
- Have a night...</i>

44:00.180 --> 44:02.370
<i>I've been thinking
about you since the party...</i>

45:27.950 --> 45:30.810
- Helen?
- Yeah?

45:30.890 --> 45:36.834
- Can I come in? I need to talk.
- Um. Yeah. Just a second.

45:40.670 --> 45:43.420
- What?
- It's 7:00 pm, Helen.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.509
My show starts at an hour.
I have to go.

45:45.510 --> 45:47.610
I know, I'm just getting ready now.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.150
- Have you seen Ed?
- No.

45:50.970 --> 45:53.859
Okay.
Should I wait for you?

45:53.860 --> 45:55.370
I just have to...

45:55.460 --> 46:00.470
- What've you been doing in here all day?
- Nothing. Okay? I'll meet you there.

46:00.510 --> 46:02.290
Okay.
Whatever.

46:18.260 --> 46:19.850
ROOM TWO

48:50.020 --> 48:52.320
Hey! You can't go down there!

48:52.830 --> 48:53.900
OPENING NIGHT

51:23.680 --> 51:24.870
Helen!

51:29.020 --> 51:30.520
Helen!

51:31.060 --> 51:32.890
What happened to your arm?

51:34.400 --> 51:36.563
Look. We need to talk
about what happened.

51:36.575 --> 51:37.300
No!

51:37.380 --> 51:40.950
Just stop okay.
Just stop!

51:41.280 --> 51:42.990
Fine! What?

51:43.930 --> 51:46.620
You have three seconds, okay?
Three, two,

51:46.700 --> 51:49.350
- ...one.
- I think I'm in love with you.

51:50.230 --> 51:52.590
OMG! You're insane!

51:52.710 --> 51:58.280
Okay, that night. When I met you at
the party, there was something about you.

51:58.360 --> 52:03.190
It was dark and it was dangerous.
It was coming off of you in waves... Stop!

52:03.590 --> 52:05.430
All right? Listen.

52:06.010 --> 52:08.789
It's like you were
crazy, but in a good way.

52:08.790 --> 52:12.740
And I can smell it.
I can smell it, it's all over you.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.050
I can't stop thinking
about you all the time.

52:15.100 --> 52:17.530
I can't stop. And last night...
My God, last night!

52:17.540 --> 52:20.210
- What are you talking about?
- Oh... Don't.

52:20.810 --> 52:23.790
You came to me.
Remember?

52:24.390 --> 52:27.827
We got into my car, went to that motel
you're obsessed with Room 2.

52:27.850 --> 52:28.850
What's happening?

52:28.860 --> 52:31.041
You said it was your first time, right?
That's gotta mean something.

52:31.100 --> 52:32.129
Fuck you!

52:32.130 --> 52:35.310
You have to understand.
Nothing in me is real!

52:35.510 --> 52:36.749
Nothing. It's only you.

52:36.750 --> 52:41.510
I can't explain it. I need
it again, please. Please.

52:41.590 --> 52:43.230
What do you want, Ed?

52:44.230 --> 52:45.990
I want you.

52:47.340 --> 52:51.559
What would you do to me?
Tell me.

52:51.560 --> 52:52.790
I want...

52:53.140 --> 52:56.580
Come on, Ed. Use your words.

52:59.440 --> 53:05.612
I want to fuck you. Hard. Harder than
you've ever been fucked in your whole life.

53:08.430 --> 53:10.130
You know what you are?

53:11.410 --> 53:12.980
You think you're a man.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.270
With your hair...

53:15.610 --> 53:17.050
and your beard,

53:17.290 --> 53:21.800
and your tattoos and your bullshit
poetry and your porno fantasies.

53:21.870 --> 53:26.270
You're not a man!
You're a fucking boy!

53:26.760 --> 53:27.820
Say it!

53:28.300 --> 53:30.370
- Say what?
- Say "I'm a boy!"

53:30.680 --> 53:33.140
"I'm a little boy".
- No.

53:33.220 --> 53:38.480
Say it, and I'll give it to you.
I'll give you what you want.

53:40.810 --> 53:45.150
I'm a boy.
I'm a little boy.

53:45.240 --> 53:47.690
Ask me what you want little boy.

53:48.950 --> 53:51.510
I want you to tear me apart.

53:53.490 --> 53:55.410
Take off your pants.

54:03.130 --> 54:07.280
- Don't move... take it off.
- What the fuck? What are you doing?

54:07.370 --> 54:09.906
You said you wanted
it dark and dangerous.

54:09.918 --> 54:11.050
Okay, okay, okay.

54:11.140 --> 54:13.360
This is what you want, isn't it?

54:14.050 --> 54:17.159
- You want me to cut it off?
- No, no, no...!

54:17.160 --> 54:18.530
- Are you afraid?
- Yes!

54:18.540 --> 54:23.960
- Are you really afraid?
- Stop! Stop...! Please!

54:30.360 --> 54:31.950
Fucking whore!

54:33.030 --> 54:36.430
And don't tell Molly, okay? Fuck!

54:46.380 --> 54:48.170
I know who you are.

54:50.720 --> 54:55.470
No no no! This isn't real.
This isn't real...

54:57.270 --> 54:58.850
No! No!

55:49.400 --> 55:54.780
Stay here. Everything will
be fine if you stay here.

55:55.950 --> 55:59.543
Fucking stay here. Damn!

57:24.190 --> 57:25.210
Molly?

57:34.410 --> 57:36.230
Do you know what time it is?

57:36.930 --> 57:39.730
I don't know. It's night.

58:02.620 --> 58:04.070
Molly...

58:06.870 --> 58:11.140
- I don't know what's happening to me.
- I do.

58:11.910 --> 58:13.350
You're sick, Helen.

58:13.840 --> 58:15.830
You're really sick.

58:16.970 --> 58:19.549
No. It's not that, it's this thing...

58:19.550 --> 58:22.530
This isn't about what's
in your brain, okay?

58:22.790 --> 58:24.890
It's about what's in your mind.

58:25.150 --> 58:28.340
- You need help.
- What are you talking about?

58:28.420 --> 58:29.812
I came back from my show last night.

58:30.013 --> 58:32.962
It went great by the way,
if you ever fucking cared.

58:34.150 --> 58:39.400
And I went to your room, because I
wanted to see my friend, and I found...

58:40.530 --> 58:41.879
this.

58:41.880 --> 58:42.880
KILL HIM

58:44.540 --> 58:45.630
And this.

58:46.510 --> 58:50.670
I AM COMING

58:53.520 --> 58:56.080
WHORE BITCH
There's more.

58:57.250 --> 58:58.230
I didn't do this!

58:58.250 --> 58:59.550
- Who did?
- I don't know.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.050
Where's Ed?

59:01.490 --> 59:02.510
I don't know, Molly.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.930
- Where is?!
- I said I don't know!

59:06.230 --> 59:09.370
Did you... do something to him?

59:10.670 --> 59:12.470
Of course not.

59:12.690 --> 59:16.930
- I don't believe you.
- Well, I don't care! It's the truth.

59:17.310 --> 59:21.780
- Why won't he call me back? Where is he?
- I don't know where he is, okay?

59:21.970 --> 59:24.760
But trust me, you're
better off without him.

59:25.890 --> 59:27.450
You fucked him, didn't you?

59:27.570 --> 59:31.250
- What? No!
- I see the way he looks at you.

59:31.330 --> 59:36.710
Molly, listen to me, okay.
Ed is bad. He is not good.

59:36.930 --> 59:39.630
Okay, he came on to me.
I said no.

59:39.730 --> 59:41.630
I said no, but he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

59:41.720 --> 59:43.670
What did you do?

59:44.170 --> 59:46.230
I just scared him. That's all.

59:49.270 --> 59:51.590
- I had a knife.
- You had a knife?

59:51.670 --> 59:54.690
It wasn't mine, okay?
I was just trying to scare him so that...

59:54.691 --> 59:57.480
- I'm calling the police, Helen.
- Why?!

59:57.570 --> 01:00:02.030
You're a danger to yourself
and other people, okay?

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:03.590
You need help.

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:07.910
This isn't me, okay? As soon as
I have the surgery I'll be fine.

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.920
People get brain tumors all the time,

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.040
they don't try and
scare people with knives.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.359
- I didn't killed anyone!
- I didn't say you did!

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.310
I'm not crazy!

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:20.140
Why would you say that? Jesus
Christ, Helen, that sucks!

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.260
I'm sorry. Molly, you know me.
You're my sister.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.274
You're not my sister.

01:00:24.275 --> 01:00:26.469
You know Helen would
never do something bad.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.540
- What?
- You know I would never do something bad.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.030
That was not what you said!

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:34.450
You're crazy, Helen.
Get out of your fucking head!

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:38.900
Helen, stop!

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.840
Helen! You're hurting me!

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.380
Wasn't me... Molly, run!

01:00:57.790 --> 01:00:59.460
Helen, stop!

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.940
I don't want to hurt you!

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:04.810
Helen, let me in!

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.570
- Helen, tell me what you did to Ed!
- Molly, please!

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.710
Helen! Open the door!

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.450
Molly!

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.960
Get away from me!

01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:34.220
Go in the car.

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.660
I've been watching you.

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:44.620
I just want to talk. You're going to get
in the fucking car. Get in the car!

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:16.740
I'm not a bad person, you know?

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.200
This is your fault!

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:28.070
This is all part of a sick little game
you've been playing with me.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.950
I'm a man. Ok, do you understand that?
I am a man.

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:36.960
And you don't get to do that to me.
You don't get to do that to me. Any day!

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.150
Ed, please just stop! You don't understand!
You don't know what it feels like!

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.920
- Take your clothes off!
- No!

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.630
Do you remember that motel? Huh?
You made up this game, I'm just playing it!

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.440
Turn around!

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.640
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Alright?

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.010
Turn around. Put your hands
on the wall. Do it!

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:58.700
No, Ed! No!
Fuck you!

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.700
Get up! I said "Get up"!

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.560
No! No! ... Wait! Wait!

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.240
I AM HERE

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:16.250
I AM HERE

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:11.250
- Hello?
- Molly?

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:18.790
Helen? Helen, listen to me.
I know you. This isn't you.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:22.910
- I'm fucking just like my mother.
- No, you're not. You're not.

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:24.899
Come home. I can help.

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.100
No!

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:33.876
No one can help me.
My sister is in my head.

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:40.189
Okay, she's... she's in my whole body.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.569
I should have died with her.

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:47.189
I should have died
with her in that motel

01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:49.558
and then none of this
would have ever happened.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.738
- I have to stop her.
- What are you talking about?

01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:00.210
It is the only way this ends,
back where it all began.

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:02.370
I'm sorry.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.229
- Helen?
- I love you.

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:07.460
Helen? Helen!
Shit!

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.730
I'm really going for Helen.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.930
You can't stop me.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.200
You're gonna die tonight.

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:26.240
Helen!

01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:03.940
You know how long I've been waiting?
It's my turn, Helen!

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:07.610
- I can stop you.
- You're just like her. You're weak!

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:11.000
- I'm not.
- So what are we doing here?

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:13.630
- This is the end!
- For you!

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:16.910
- For both of us!
- She was a whore!

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:18.110
Stop!

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:29.340
She tried to kill me.
But I hid... inside of you.

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.130
I kept you alive.

01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:36.190
All these years, with you,
with your fucking waste of a life.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.498
You're dead.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:52.360
No, Helen. I'm finally
getting out of here.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.080
Out of you!

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.210
It's my turn, Helen.

01:13:57.390 --> 01:14:00.760
My turn!

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:13.090
Helen! Helen!

01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:22.440
Helen?

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:29.190
Helen?

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.210
What did you do?

01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:37.030
She's here.

01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:42.510
- Who? Who is here?
- My sister.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.410
- She's not real!
- Molly, run!

01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:51.000
- No.
- Molly please go. Go!

01:14:55.710 --> 01:15:00.020
- How many pills did you take?
- All of them.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.150
Molly...

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:06.149
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
