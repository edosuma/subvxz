<i>...1-9-1-6.</i>

02:58.261 --> 03:00.471
<i>Approaching transport vessel: </i>Resolute.

03:00.555 --> 03:05.059
<i>Identification 6-1-2-1-9-1-6.</i>

03:05.935 --> 03:07.478
All right, everyone, wake up.

03:09.981 --> 03:10.899
Strap in.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.484
We made it.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.664
No offense, but it will be nice
to hear other people's voices.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.461
I want ice cream.
I want a lot of ice cream.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.673
Actually, no. I want any food
that cannot be farmed or rehydrated.

03:36.466 --> 03:41.763
Hey, what about you, Will?
You excited to go back to school?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.640
Uh, yeah. Sure.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.767
Excuse me?

03:45.850 --> 03:48.686
Who are you and what have you done
with my nerdy brother?

03:50.980 --> 03:51.898
Hey! Check it out.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.234
Wow.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.242
Super happy for you guys.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.579
<i>Resolute,</i> this is Jupiter 2.
Come in.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.625
<i>Resolute,</i> this is Jupiter 2. Come in.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.878
Maybe the radio got damaged
by the lightning storm.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.464
It doesn't matter.
They'll have seen us by now.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.717
I just don't understand.
What is the <i>Resolute </i>doing here?

04:19.801 --> 04:22.387
It must have got pulled
into the rift, same as us.

04:22.470 --> 04:26.266
But they have power.They should have been
on their way to Alpha Centauri by now.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.893
You don't think they've been looking
for us this whole time.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.895
If so, we have a lot
of thank-you cards to write.

04:32.063 --> 04:35.400
Okay. On my signal,
initiate docking procedure.

04:36.067 --> 04:39.279
Three, two, one.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.714
Hm. Look at you.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.218
You excited to see a certain
sixteen-year-old of the male persuasion?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.137
If you're talking about Vijay,
the answer's no.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.388
He dumped me. Remember?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.098
Yeah, but then you dumped him.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.642
Okay. We did a lot of dumping.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.645
I really hope you're not talking about
what it sounds like.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.939
- Hey! Wait up! I'm coming.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.524
No! No! Hey, hey!

05:16.607 --> 05:19.068
You are on bed rest
until the parenthesia wears off.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.778
What? Can't a man stretch his legs?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.613
Yes, but a man has to be able
to use them first.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.074
I can use them. It's not--

05:25.158 --> 05:27.285
-You okay?
-I'm just gonna stay back.

05:27.994 --> 05:28.911
Yeah, good idea.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.622
Someone should watch Smith
until Radic picks her up.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
Okay, fine. Just one condition.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.255
If any of you run into livestock
migration, not a word about Debbie.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.342
She's a finders-keepers-type situation.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.805
I know we celebrated ahead of time.
What do you want me to tell you?

05:51.434 --> 05:53.269
I guess this is the end of the road.

05:56.689 --> 06:00.526
I don't suppose keeping me locked up
for seven months counts as time served.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.778
Not one bit.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.533
Are those really necessary?

06:09.243 --> 06:11.496
I'll tell the authorities
where to find you.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.458
I know I'm not in a position
to ask for anything,

06:15.541 --> 06:17.794
but when you decide what to say about me,

06:17.877 --> 06:20.213
I hope you remember
all the good I've done.

06:22.382 --> 06:26.010
It doesn't even come close
to making up for the bad.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.929
Come on, Maureen.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.682
There's a little good and bad
in all of us.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.895
Nobody's hands are completely clean.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.899
Not even yours.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.695
-There something you want to say?
-I know you're the kind of woman

06:44.779 --> 06:48.741
who would do whatever's necessary
to protect the ones she loves.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.204
The only difference between you and me

06:53.287 --> 06:55.915
is the only one I love is myself.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.168
If you really loved yourself,
you'd stop pretending

06:59.252 --> 07:00.670
to be someone you're not.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.134
Good luck, Dr. Smith.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.678
Jessica Harris.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.721
Whoever you are.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.861
I'll have two olives in my martini.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.071
- What are you doing, June?
<i>-</i>Having fun.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.115
Mom said we're not allowed
without permission.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.575
Are we allowed to use those?

07:30.658 --> 07:32.285
Mom doesn't need to know.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.287
Girls?

07:36.164 --> 07:37.540
Ow!

07:37.623 --> 07:39.542
- What is going--

07:39.625 --> 07:41.794
-Not one more step, June.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.255
I want you to look at her!

07:44.839 --> 07:45.840
Look at her!

07:47.425 --> 07:49.510
I want you to see the pain you've caused.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.516
<i>Decontamination in progress.</i>

07:59.437 --> 08:01.147
We should hit the virtual track.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.108
Be nice to run on something
longer than a treadmill.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.067
Yeah. Maybe.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.738
<i>Decontamination complete in five, four...</i>

08:08.821 --> 08:10.406
It'll be good to see everyone again.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.159
Hiroki. Naoko. Even Victor.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.368
<i>...one.</i>

08:15.036 --> 08:16.454
Resolute<i> access granted.</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:22.835
Huh. Well, so much
for the welcoming committee.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.213
Who cares? Last one to the dining hall
has laundry duty!

08:25.296 --> 08:27.632
Wait! I'm not touching
any of your underwear!

08:29.675 --> 08:31.260
-Want me to go get them?
-No.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.429
I haven't seen them this excited
in a while.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.139
The dining hall's not far.
We'll catch up.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.182
Don?

08:36.933 --> 08:37.850
Yeah.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.270
<i> It looks like this part</i>
<i>of B-Deck has been evacuated for repairs.</i>

08:41.562 --> 08:45.358
<i>Probably relocated the colonists,</i>
<i>so we're gonna head to the other side.</i>

08:45.441 --> 08:48.569
Copy that. Slow down.
You eat way too fast.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.197
Hey, you're supposed to be cuffed.

08:51.739 --> 08:52.907
What are you doing?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.867
Stop going through my stuff.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.661
Ah! There you are.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.871
Dr. Zachary Smith.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.123
You should have told me
you found this, Don.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.125
What's the point of telling you
something you know?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.878
-We're supposed to be partners.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.797
We're not partners.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.175
We're just two people
with a mutually beneficial pact

09:11.259 --> 09:12.969
to stay out of each other's way.

09:14.929 --> 09:19.976
Is holding onto incriminating evidence
staying out of my way?

09:22.603 --> 09:25.648
I ruin people for a living, Don,

09:27.149 --> 09:28.985
and I make a very good living.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.364
Are we clear?

09:35.074 --> 09:35.908
Good.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.789
If anyone calls to check up on me,
I'm curled up with a good book.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.457
Yeah? You think that's a good idea?

09:43.541 --> 09:46.669
Pretty sure someone out there knows
you're not the real Dr. Smith.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.838
Never worry
about what someone knows.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.464
Only what they can prove.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.471
Hurry up, slowpokes!

10:06.230 --> 10:07.148
Wait, what?

10:09.191 --> 10:11.319
Mom! Dad!

10:11.402 --> 10:13.404
Yeah? What is it?

10:15.698 --> 10:18.784
<i>♪ Some people call me the space cowboy ♪</i>

10:19.827 --> 10:21.120
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

10:21.203 --> 10:22.955
Kids, go back to the Jupiter.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.832
- But we--
-It's not a discussion. Go.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.839
<i>♪ Some people call me Maurice ♪</i>

10:33.174 --> 10:34.008
<i>♪ 'Cause I speak... ♪</i>

10:34.091 --> 10:36.927
For relocation you don't leave things
looking like this.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.224
Victor,
this is Maureen Robinson. Come in.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.603
Hiroki, this is Maureen. Can you hear me?

10:48.648 --> 10:49.482
Okay.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.778
There's a system portal on the East Deck.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.113
I can access the integrated database
from there.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.657
What'll that tell us?

10:58.616 --> 11:01.494
Any broadcast from the <i>Resolute </i>command
will be recorded;

11:01.577 --> 11:03.579
system malfunctions, evacuation orders.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.539
If we wanna find out
what happened here,

11:05.623 --> 11:07.333
that'll give us our answers.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.380
It shorted out.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.090
Maybe a power surge.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.051
-No, wait, I got something.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.931
<i>Abort!</i>

11:25.142 --> 11:27.269
<i>Respond.... immediately!</i>

11:28.813 --> 11:29.772
That's it.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.274
That's the last recording from the ship.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.818
When was it made?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.073
Seven months ago.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.451
The day we disappeared.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.125
<i> Jessica Harris.</i>
<i>Status: detained.</i>

11:49.917 --> 11:51.544
<i>Stairwell access denied.</i>

12:21.532 --> 12:23.659
<i> Welcome. Jessica Harris.</i>

13:02.656 --> 13:05.534
- I thought you quit, Jessica.
-I did...

13:06.869 --> 13:10.080
but Mom's not getting any better.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.373
So...

13:12.750 --> 13:15.252
I'm not lending you any more money.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.879
Of course not.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.339
It's just that I missed some...

13:20.049 --> 13:22.885
payments on the loan you cosigned, so...

13:22.968 --> 13:25.346
-How many?
-A few. Like...

13:26.555 --> 13:27.473
six?

13:29.433 --> 13:30.476
Six?

13:30.726 --> 13:33.270
My name is on that loan!

13:34.146 --> 13:35.898
If it goes into default,

13:36.023 --> 13:38.275
my credit is totally r--

13:42.321 --> 13:44.114
Mom took care of it.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.367
I just thought you should know
in case the bank

13:46.951 --> 13:48.285
sent a letter.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.663
What are you gonna do

13:50.746 --> 13:53.749
when Mom isn't around to take care
of you anymore?

13:54.625 --> 13:58.045
I'll just have to figure out
how to survive on my own.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.054
<i>Fire protocol on Deck B.</i>
<i>Bulkhead doors are now closing.</i>

14:08.722 --> 14:11.058
<i>Fire detected. Stairwell unlocked.</i>

14:13.018 --> 14:15.020
<i>Fire protocol on Deck B...</i>

14:15.104 --> 14:17.022
-What deck are we on?
-B-Deck.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.405
- Judy!
-Penny! Will!

14:28.325 --> 14:29.618
Hey, everybody okay?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.413
<i>-Did you make it back to the Jupiter?</i>
<i>-</i>Uh, no, no, not quite yet.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.540
-<i>The bulkhead is shut down.</i>
-Here, too.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.666
Is there a fire?

14:35.749 --> 14:38.961
<i>If there is, it's already out.</i>
<i>The fail-safes ensure containment.</i>

14:39.044 --> 14:40.004
Anyone hurt?

14:40.087 --> 14:42.089
<i>No, but we're separated.</i>

14:42.172 --> 14:44.049
<i>-</i>Oh.
<i>-Will and Penny are together. I'm fine.</i>

14:44.133 --> 14:44.967
Okay.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.679
Now, you're-- You're just gonna
have to make it back a different way.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.473
<i>Use your maps.</i>
<i>Find a way to circumvent the closures.</i>

14:51.557 --> 14:53.517
Make your way to the decks above or below.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.394
All right. Let's go.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.899
And if you see anything strange,
you call us immediately, okay?

15:03.652 --> 15:06.614
<i>Welcome to Security Station One.</i>

15:15.664 --> 15:17.958
Hello, Doctor Zoe.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.753
Pediatrician.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.338
No, thank you.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.590
I'm a therapist.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.342
Hello.

16:51.802 --> 16:52.678
Hi.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.058
Hi, what's your name?

16:59.810 --> 17:00.978
Samantha.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.646
Hi, Samantha.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.233
It's nice to meet you. My name's Judy.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.236
Did you come to get me?

17:10.988 --> 17:11.822
Um...

17:12.448 --> 17:13.574
Are you alone?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.037
Where is everyone else?

17:18.537 --> 17:19.830
They left.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.751
Uh, d-do you mean, uh, evacuated?

17:26.712 --> 17:27.546
Okay.

17:27.629 --> 17:28.505
Do you know why?

17:29.923 --> 17:31.633
It's okay. You can tell me.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.766
The monster.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.603
You're looking at me
like you're judging me.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.271
I had to let the crazy lady go.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.025
You see that? She's back already.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.109
No harm done.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.403
You're so over-dramatic sometimes.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.079
Smith! Hello!

18:04.750 --> 18:05.584
Smith!

18:07.628 --> 18:08.462
Stay here.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.089
Hello.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.262
Whoa! Oh! No, no!

18:59.763 --> 19:01.056
Mom? Dad? Um...

19:01.140 --> 19:03.517
I-- I found someone.
I found a girl.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.269
Does she know where
the other survivors are?

19:05.352 --> 19:06.812
<i>No. She's alone.</i>

19:06.895 --> 19:09.231
She says there's something on the ship,
some--

19:09.314 --> 19:12.985
Robinsons, there's a thing
in the hub in a box.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.487
-<i>I don't know what it is.</i>
<i>-</i>Don, it's okay.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.197
It's part of the broken robot.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.949
Probably should have mentioned
it was there.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.450
Oh! You think?

19:20.534 --> 19:23.370
The glowing black thing's crawling
all over the place.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.206
Wait! Don!
Did you say the cables were moving?

19:26.331 --> 19:27.207
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:27.291 --> 19:29.209
Like they were reaching for something?

19:29.293 --> 19:30.127
I don't know.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.671
I was caught up with the creepy metal hand
nobody told me about.

19:32.754 --> 19:33.589
Mom!

19:33.839 --> 19:35.883
That's what happened
when I was up in the tree.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.843
When I first met the robot.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.845
<i>It's trying to put himself</i>
<i>back together. Wait.</i>

19:39.928 --> 19:41.930
Hold on. But if this belongs to the SAR,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.724
does that mean that the SAR is...

19:44.933 --> 19:45.809
He's here.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.149
Samantha!

19:55.277 --> 19:56.403
What do we do now?

19:57.988 --> 20:00.616
We need to find a meeting place
with multiple access points

20:00.699 --> 20:04.286
where we can gather together safely,
figure out what the hell is going on.

20:04.369 --> 20:08.123
We're-- We're near the dining hall.
We can go and meet you there.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.374
Okay, Judy.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.627
<i>-Are you close enough to get there?</i>
-Uh...

20:12.628 --> 20:14.046
I-- I-- I-- I don't know.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.422
We can go this way.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.548
Wait, are you sure?

20:17.382 --> 20:19.968
Hey, um, my friend says
she can get us there.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.805
Great. Everyone keep their radios on
and we'll get to you as soon as we can.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.350
Wait, wait! Don, go to the cockpit.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.351
Copy.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.897
<i>Okay, I'm here.</i>

20:31.980 --> 20:34.650
Uh, look out the window. Do you have
a clear view to the dining hall?

20:39.112 --> 20:40.239
Yeah, I see it.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.033
Okay. Will and Penny, go to the window
and wave at Don.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.537
Yeah, I see our Jupiter.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.457
Okay, Don, keep your eye on them,

20:50.540 --> 20:52.376
and anything that's not them.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.294
Wait. Aren't you guys coming back here?

20:54.378 --> 20:57.047
The bulkhead doors are down.
Something must have triggered them.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.967
Not something. Someone.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.426
What are you talking about?

21:01.510 --> 21:02.552
Smith...

21:02.636 --> 21:04.179
She, um, she got out.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.014
<i>What? How?</i>

21:06.598 --> 21:08.558
She-- She was cuffed to the chair.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.103
I don't know.
One minute she was there and--

21:11.853 --> 21:14.147
She must have slipped past me.
I'm sorry.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.440
What is she up to?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.693
Come on, we got bigger things
to worry about than Smith.

21:17.776 --> 21:18.652
Let's go.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.370
Yeah, super glad we chose
to hide out here,

21:28.453 --> 21:30.622
surrounded by moldy food and terror.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.375
Penny, if SAR's here

21:34.501 --> 21:35.335
and alive,

21:35.419 --> 21:37.754
-do you think that means--
-Will. No.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.340
But the last time we saw the robot
they were fighting and then--

21:40.424 --> 21:43.552
And you always say that you feel connected
to the robot, right?

21:44.303 --> 21:48.348
Okay, so don't you think if something bad
happened to him you'd feel it?

21:53.729 --> 21:55.939
Um, I really hope everybody else
gets here soon.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.908
<i>♪ Some people call me the space cowboy ♪</i>

22:07.826 --> 22:10.829
-♪ <i>Some call me the gangster of love... ♪</i>
-Stop it.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.291
Sorry, it's stuck in my head.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.501
You used to love it when I sang.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.794
Love is a strong word.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.130
-Plus, I know what you're doing.
-What's that?

22:20.213 --> 22:23.258
You're trying to distract me from the fact
that our kids are in danger.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.301
Is it working?

22:24.384 --> 22:25.302
Not a bit.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.895
Two more cooling vents
and we'll be at the dining hall.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.564
Great.
Seems like you've been this way a lot.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.359
Yeah, in the beginning, but...

22:40.442 --> 22:42.235
Careful. Your bag is caught
on the--

22:43.111 --> 22:44.237
No!

22:44.321 --> 22:45.781
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.534
They're-- They're important.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.495
That's all.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.166
It's from your family, right?

22:56.792 --> 22:57.834
From my dad.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.421
He worked here.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.466
The rule was after ten trips

23:04.800 --> 23:06.510
he was allowed to bring us

23:06.593 --> 23:09.805
and we were all going to get to stay
on  Alpha Centauri...

23:10.514 --> 23:11.390
together.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.309
It's a good rule.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.727
After the first attack

23:15.811 --> 23:17.312
they tried to find him,

23:17.396 --> 23:19.398
but then it was just me and my mom.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.027
When the monsters came back again...

23:24.945 --> 23:25.946
we...

23:27.989 --> 23:29.324
we got separated.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.619
I don't know where she is.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.040
You know, if they were evacuated

23:38.250 --> 23:41.002
your mom will be out there somewhere
looking for you,

23:43.255 --> 23:47.300
and when we get back to my family
we're going to help you find yours, okay?

23:49.052 --> 23:49.886
Okay.

23:52.639 --> 23:55.892
Wait, you said
"when the monsters came back."

23:57.394 --> 23:59.020
Did you mean that there was more than one?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.377
Well, there's no water coming out
of the taps.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.921
You know what that means?

24:25.005 --> 24:28.884
The oxygen generating system must be
diverting resources to keep us breathing.

24:30.135 --> 24:34.014
I was gonna go with no Slurpees,
but yes, that's also true.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.726
What was that?

24:40.562 --> 24:43.607
Mom. Dad. There's something coming
towards us, please tell me it's you.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.317
We're still below you.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.526
Hide!

24:46.610 --> 24:48.695
<i>Don't make a sound. Mute your coms.</i>

24:49.362 --> 24:51.865
Don, can you see any movement
outside the dining hall?

24:51.948 --> 24:53.909
No, nothing. Not from this angle.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.084
I can still hear it.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.170
Come on, we got to keep moving.

25:28.568 --> 25:29.444
Hm.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.408
Mom. Dad.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.785
<i>We're okay.</i>

25:36.868 --> 25:37.994
-You sure?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

25:38.078 --> 25:40.121
You're not going to believe it,
but there's--

25:40.205 --> 25:41.873
There's a horse in the dining hall.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.166
Did you say a horse?

25:43.250 --> 25:45.335
Yeah, I think he came looking for food.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.796
<i>Guys, don't laugh,</i>
<i>but it looks like there's</i>

25:47.879 --> 25:51.466
-a horse loose in the dining hall.
-Good to know, Don.<i> </i>Thanks. Very timely.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.009
Okay. Sarcasm.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.095
<i> Hey, guys. Is Judy there yet?</i>

25:55.178 --> 25:56.638
-<i>She said she was close.</i>
-No.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.764
We haven't seen her.

25:58.848 --> 25:59.808
Judy?

26:00.850 --> 26:01.685
Judy!

26:16.491 --> 26:17.909
- <i>Judy, if you're--</i>
-Dad.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.078
Are you okay? Why weren't you answering?

26:20.161 --> 26:22.163
We saw something...
No, below us.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.331
It was in--

26:23.415 --> 26:24.833
Which deck?

26:24.958 --> 26:26.960
-B.
- <i>B.</i>

26:27.043 --> 26:27.961
Heading which way?

26:28.044 --> 26:30.547
<i>The same way we are.</i>
<i>Towards the dining hall.</i>

26:32.882 --> 26:34.801
<i>Opening Cryo Bay Six.</i>

26:34.884 --> 26:36.761
<i>Dr. Zachary Smith.</i>

26:37.554 --> 26:40.640
<i>Patient status: awaiting treatment.</i>

26:52.944 --> 26:53.778
Who are you?

26:53.862 --> 26:55.905
Don't you know?

26:56.489 --> 26:58.658
- <i>Cryo Sleep activated.</i>

26:58.742 --> 26:59.701
I'm you.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.584
<i> I'm really proud of you, baby.</i>

27:07.667 --> 27:11.129
You know, you must be doing
very well to afford all this.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.214
I know it took a while,

27:13.298 --> 27:14.966
but I think I finally found my calling.

27:15.050 --> 27:15.967
This new job.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.218
It's in finance?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.095
Uh, portfolio assessment.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.347
Mainly overseas.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.891
Very corporate.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.643
Whup! Empty.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.853
I'm going to go downstairs and fill it up.

27:30.774 --> 27:31.608
So.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.194
Tell me, sis.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.489
Ever hear a name...

27:38.406 --> 27:39.282
Jeri Vick?

27:40.325 --> 27:41.576
I can't say I have.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.870
She's an investment banker.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.289
Passed away...

27:47.040 --> 27:48.208
two months ago.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.250
Oh...

27:49.334 --> 27:52.462
But for some reason, some of her clients

27:53.338 --> 27:55.924
still believe they're conducting business
with her.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.593
Yeah, I found...

28:00.136 --> 28:02.472
a stack of  these business cards...

28:03.932 --> 28:05.350
in your new car.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.936
Come on.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.897
Anyone with enough money to invest
can afford to lose a little.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.526
Just because you pretend
to be someone else...

28:14.609 --> 28:17.195
-...doesn't mean it's not your fault.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.489
It does if you don't get caught.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.410
-But I just caught you.
- Girls!

28:23.493 --> 28:25.120
Come join me up here!

28:25.620 --> 28:28.790
Let's enjoy the view
before the Zofran wears off.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.420
-If you're not gonna tell her, I will.
- Come on.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.463
She's having a good day.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.758
Why do you want to ruin it for her?

28:38.842 --> 28:40.260
Like you ruin those other people?

28:40.343 --> 28:41.344
What people?

28:42.554 --> 28:43.847
Do you know them?

28:43.930 --> 28:45.682
Ever seen their faces?

28:46.349 --> 28:47.559
That's the beauty of it.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.436
Neither have I.

28:59.779 --> 29:00.822
Hey!

29:01.990 --> 29:02.866
John.

29:03.324 --> 29:04.284
What is it?

29:04.951 --> 29:06.202
Look at this.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.037
Whoa.

29:09.622 --> 29:12.000
Blast marks everywhere.
Must have been a hell of a fight.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.085
Behind this wall.
That's where they kept it.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.336
The alien engine.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.089
That's why the <i>Resolute's </i>still here.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.301
SAR came back to finish the job
that Will's robot couldn't do.

29:21.384 --> 29:25.138
Without the engine the <i>Resolute's </i>nothing
more than a floating parking lot.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.016
Come on. We've got to keep moving.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.066
Stupid horse nearly gave me
a heart attack.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.779
He's stupid? I thought you liked horses.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.531
No, no, no, no, no.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.576
They're smelly and their teeth
are uncomfortably huge

29:46.659 --> 29:49.037
and so is their poop. I just...
It's not for me.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.834
But at Grandma's you were always
hanging out in the stables.

29:54.918 --> 29:58.505
If you don't like horses,
then why were you--

29:58.588 --> 30:00.089
Because Mom was there.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.301
She loves horses.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.307
It's always been really easy for you

30:09.390 --> 30:11.017
because you and Mom
have the science thing,

30:12.018 --> 30:14.938
but I wanted something in common, too,
so I made one up.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.399
-Uh-oh.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.235
-Why "uh-oh?"
-He's scared.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.071
Of what?

30:32.121 --> 30:33.665
Can I ask you something?

30:34.082 --> 30:35.208
Uh, yeah.

30:35.959 --> 30:36.835
Sure.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.170
The place we met, that Hall of Heroes--

30:39.254 --> 30:42.048
do you think the people
who didn't survive up here--

30:42.131 --> 30:46.052
do you think... maybe...
will go up on that wall someday?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.137
Yeah. Um...

30:48.847 --> 30:50.265
Yeah, I believe they will.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.435
You know, um...

30:55.520 --> 30:57.647
my dad's up there on that wall.

30:57.730 --> 30:58.773
For real?

30:59.440 --> 31:00.275
Mm-hm.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.529
Never got to know him, though.
It happened before I was born.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.991
My mom told me that
he'll always be with me,

31:08.408 --> 31:09.242
that...

31:09.659 --> 31:12.120
a lot goes into making a person
who they are.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.122
And he'll always be a part of them,

31:14.205 --> 31:16.499
just like your dad will always be
a part of you.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.419
That's just something people say
to make you feel better.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.628
Yeah, maybe,

31:21.337 --> 31:24.424
but no one taught you how to survive here
on your own...

31:26.134 --> 31:27.510
yet you did.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.472
So where do you think you got that from?

31:33.016 --> 31:35.435
Maybe he's even the one
keeping the monster away.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.943
<i>...fake their way into a new life.</i>

31:45.528 --> 31:46.571
<i>June Harris.</i>

31:46.988 --> 31:47.906
<i>What a career.</i>

31:48.072 --> 31:49.115
<i>Breaking and entering.</i>

31:49.949 --> 31:51.451
<i>Possession of stolen goods.</i>

31:51.910 --> 31:53.870
<i>Identity theft. Mail schemes.</i>

31:54.787 --> 31:56.497
<i>You've graduated to the big time. </i>

31:56.915 --> 31:59.626
<i>We have-- We have you on camera.</i>

32:07.592 --> 32:08.676
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

32:08.760 --> 32:10.970
- <i>Let's make a deal.</i>

32:15.350 --> 32:17.560
<i>Air lock releasing in ten seconds.</i>

32:17.644 --> 32:20.897
- <i>You open this door...</i>
- <i>...to overide, 9, 8...</i>

32:20.980 --> 32:22.440
<i>You don't want to do this to me.</i>

32:22.523 --> 32:25.485
<i>Just because you pretend</i>
<i>to be someone else...</i>

32:25.568 --> 32:28.696
- <i>...to look at...</i>
<i>-...doesn't mean it's not your fault.</i>

32:39.707 --> 32:42.335
Guys. Your folks are almost there.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.420
<i> Thanks, Don.</i>

32:44.504 --> 32:46.923
-Any sign of Judy?
-No, not at the moment, but...

32:53.388 --> 32:54.263
-Whoa.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.267
Don, what's going on?
The lights just went out.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.729
The entire electrical system on B-Deck
is resetting or something.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.482
Smith, son of a...

33:04.941 --> 33:06.985
Uh, Robinsons, turn on your flashlights

33:07.068 --> 33:08.569
so I can see where you are, please.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.365
John, you got a straight shot
to the dining hall.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.328
Judy, I thought you were in
the subsystem.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.454
Uh, we are.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.206
Well, then, who the hell's...

33:20.289 --> 33:21.666
<i>Maybe it's Smith.</i>

33:23.751 --> 33:25.211
Hey. He's doing it again.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.760
Whatever it is, it's moving.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.722
-Where are they going? Talk to me, Don.
- <i>Toward the dining hall.</i>

33:35.805 --> 33:37.432
You have to get it to calm down.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.683
-How?
-Well, I don't know.

33:38.766 --> 33:42.020
You're supposed to be the horse girl.
Come on.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.025
It's okay.

33:47.859 --> 33:48.776
Hi.

33:50.653 --> 33:53.364
Just a little upset.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.285
All right.

33:57.368 --> 34:01.581
- You got this.
-It's okay. Shhh.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.374
It's okay.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.462
It's okay. Shh.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.092
Whoa.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.263
Okay, now they're stopping...

34:18.056 --> 34:19.849
<i>They're heading in another direction.</i>

34:33.529 --> 34:34.906
Guys, it's not Smith.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.657
-<i>I repeat, it's not Smith!</i>
-SAR.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.369
Run!

34:40.912 --> 34:42.663
Will! Penny! You need to hide now!

34:45.583 --> 34:47.543
<i>Backup power engaged.</i>

35:05.061 --> 35:06.854
- That's...
- ...not...

35:06.938 --> 35:07.897
...SAR.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.317
How many of these things are there?

35:12.151 --> 35:13.528
It's in the dining hall.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.238
Hey! Hey!

35:16.823 --> 35:17.949
We're not gonna make it!

35:29.544 --> 35:31.045
Come on, come on.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.061
Some people call me the space cowboy!

35:47.937 --> 35:51.357
Some call me the gangster of love!

35:53.151 --> 35:56.779
Some people call me Maurice!

35:56.863 --> 36:03.202
-'Cause I speak of the pompatus of love!

36:03.286 --> 36:04.871
It's moving away from the kids.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.330
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.456
Keep going!

36:07.540 --> 36:09.876
Some people talk about me, baby!

36:10.751 --> 36:12.503
I don't know any more of the words.

36:13.045 --> 36:15.673
I don't think we're going
to need them anyway. Run!

36:15.756 --> 36:16.841
-Run!

36:16.924 --> 36:19.302
Guys, it's coming fast.
You need to pick it up.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.555
Don, we're gonna need your help!

36:22.638 --> 36:23.764
<i>What kind of help?</i>

36:23.848 --> 36:26.142
<i>The kind where you tell</i>
<i>us where the hell we're going.</i>

36:26.225 --> 36:27.059
Uh... Right.

36:27.935 --> 36:28.769
Um...

36:30.479 --> 36:32.356
Beautiful. Way easier to fix than to use.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.483
Here. Follow me.

36:37.778 --> 36:38.654
Run.

36:51.042 --> 36:51.876
I lost you guys.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.754
<i>John? Maureen?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

36:55.254 --> 36:58.007
<i>What's going on? Is everything okay?</i>
<i>Someone talk to me.</i>

36:58.257 --> 36:59.133
Don.

36:59.759 --> 37:00.927
Is it close?

37:01.010 --> 37:03.012
<i>I don't know. I've lost visual.</i>

37:03.095 --> 37:06.057
Can you create a diversion
of some kind,

37:06.140 --> 37:07.975
an alarm or something?<i> </i>

37:08.059 --> 37:10.603
<i>Yeah, but it's going</i>
<i>to take a couple minutes.</i>

37:10.978 --> 37:14.273
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>a couple minutes. It's getting closer.</i>

37:14.357 --> 37:16.359
<i>I can only do</i>
<i>so much, Maureen.</i>

37:16.901 --> 37:19.237
<i>Actually, Don,</i>
<i>you've been perfect.</i>

37:20.279 --> 37:21.364
Go, John! Now!

37:37.463 --> 37:39.382
So you never loved my singing?

37:40.675 --> 37:41.676
No.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.640
Someone's gonna have to explain to me
what the hell just happened.

37:48.307 --> 37:49.934
Kids, it's safe to come out now.

37:51.727 --> 37:53.688
-See you in a few minutes.
- <i>Okay.</i>

38:04.031 --> 38:04.991
Judy.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.076
What are you doing here?

38:08.202 --> 38:12.164
Don. He, uh, he wanted me
to make sure you were okay.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.916
Is she a friend of yours?

38:14.333 --> 38:15.376
Um...

38:15.793 --> 38:16.752
No, not exactly.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.170
We're more like family.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.381
Hey, come on,
let's go back to the Jupiter, okay?

38:20.464 --> 38:21.882
-Don't forget your picture.
-Okay.

38:26.345 --> 38:28.306
It must be a very important photograph.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.393
It's me... and my dad.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.189
It's the last one I have of him.

38:37.898 --> 38:40.234
You don't want to do this to me.
Press the override.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.320
<i>Please! Override!</i>

38:46.824 --> 38:48.701
I'm sorry for your loss.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.663
-Hey, come on.
-Yeah.

39:08.846 --> 39:09.805
Mom!

39:09.889 --> 39:10.723
Dad!

39:10.806 --> 39:12.141
-Oh!
-Hi.

39:12.224 --> 39:13.100
Hey!

39:13.184 --> 39:14.560
-You're okay.
-Are you okay?

39:29.116 --> 39:31.035
You've been here this whole time?

39:33.120 --> 39:36.123
-You people purposely look for danger.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.666
Oh, that's funny?

39:38.167 --> 39:39.543
You're good, though, right?

39:42.088 --> 39:42.922
Hey.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.466
You've always been so good with animals.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.635
Thank you.

39:52.431 --> 39:53.641
Will.

39:53.724 --> 39:57.019
Samantha told me that when the <i>Resolute</i>
was attacked for a second time

39:57.520 --> 39:58.896
that there were two robots.

39:58.979 --> 40:00.064
It wasn't just SAR.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.316
Yeah, I know.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.151
-We saw the other--
-No.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.153
She said the second one was shaped
like a man.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.490
It had two legs
and it was protecting people.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.701
Will, your robot was here.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.162
What does that mean?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.414
It means...

40:17.248 --> 40:18.666
that somewhere on the ship

40:19.542 --> 40:20.459
there's a clue.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.878
We just have to find it.

40:22.962 --> 40:23.838
A clue for what?

40:24.922 --> 40:26.340
For where he is now.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.093
Can we just have a break, just for once...

40:45.943 --> 40:46.986
Hey, look!

40:52.783 --> 40:53.826
Survivors!

40:59.540 --> 41:00.708
-Who is it?
-Hello.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.211
Contain them.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.422
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.
Everything's fine.

41:06.505 --> 41:07.756
Robinsons.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.259
Glad to see you all in one piece.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.845
Ben Adler,
deputy director of advanced systems.

41:12.928 --> 41:15.139
Now, please.
Get on board, while we still can.

41:15.222 --> 41:17.892
If you're worried about that thing
wandering around, we contained it.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.352
Contained it? With what?

41:20.978 --> 41:22.062
A radio.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.814
Well, and me. Hey.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.442
Don West. I was pretty vital
in this whole operation.

41:26.525 --> 41:29.069
-I was the eyes. I was the ears--
-Mostly the mouth.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.073
How did you know we were here?

41:33.157 --> 41:35.034
As soon as you docked
I picked up your signal.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.245
Samantha?

41:38.954 --> 41:39.872
Is that you?

41:42.416 --> 41:44.168
We looked everywhere for you.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.878
Your mom's going to be overwhelmed.

41:45.961 --> 41:47.046
She's alive?

41:47.922 --> 41:48.964
Oh, very...

41:50.341 --> 41:52.092
and she's been missing you so much.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.137
Where is she?

41:56.722 --> 42:00.059
After the attack, we all took refuge
on a planet in the system.

42:00.142 --> 42:01.185
Temporarily.

42:01.268 --> 42:04.271
Only until the <i>Resolute </i>was safe enough
to support us again.

42:04.438 --> 42:05.856
Where did it come from--

42:06.065 --> 42:07.525
That robot up here?

42:07.691 --> 42:09.068
What happened to it?

42:09.151 --> 42:10.736
And you must be young Will.

42:11.445 --> 42:14.073
We've heard quite a few stories about you
from the other survivors.

42:14.156 --> 42:17.368
When we've all settled in, I'd love
to hear it from the horse's mouth.

42:17.451 --> 42:21.163
Speaking of horses, you might want a mop
and some disinfectant for the dining hall.

42:21.247 --> 42:22.248
It's kinda...

42:22.331 --> 42:24.124
Could we speak to you privately?

42:30.548 --> 42:32.800
Sounds like you had quite the adventure
up there.

42:33.425 --> 42:34.885
You must have some questions.

42:35.177 --> 42:36.470
Uh, a few.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.847
Let's start with what the hell it was
we trapped back there.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.975
You didn't trap it. You put it back.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.061
Put it back?

42:44.436 --> 42:47.231
Let's just say
your son wasn't the first one

42:47.314 --> 42:49.608
to make contact with
an alien intelligence.

42:54.154 --> 42:55.406
We call it Scarecrow.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.491
I'm familiar with scarecrows.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.160
The real ones don't usually try
and kill the crows.

43:00.369 --> 43:03.831
So, that thing's been on the <i>Resolute</i>
this whole time?

43:03.914 --> 43:05.583
-Indeed.
-For what purpose?

43:05.666 --> 43:09.920
The answer to that and a whole lot more
is on the other side of this wall.

43:12.548 --> 43:14.091
What do you say, Robinsons?

43:14.925 --> 43:16.510
Ready to go through the looking glass?
