01:32.493 --> 01:34.810
Mr. Kipling, you're getting
a time out.

01:34.840 --> 01:35.909
And no TV for a week.

01:37.777 --> 01:39.974
I think you are being very harsh.

01:40.004 --> 01:41.972
Mr. Kipling
paid you a visit

01:42.012 --> 01:44.669
because he gets bored in his cage.

01:44.709 --> 01:46.007
Plus, he's a cuddler.

01:47.845 --> 01:51.971
Oh, that explains the claw marks
on my calves!

01:52.011 --> 01:54.807
Jessie, I have a huge problem.

01:54.837 --> 01:56.675
I love my photography class!

01:56.705 --> 01:59.742
Okay, I know I'm new at
this whole nanny thing,

01:59.772 --> 02:02.668
but not seeing the problem.

02:02.708 --> 02:06.773
The problem is I got
for this assignment. Partner.

02:06.803 --> 02:08.631
You call it lazy,

02:08.670 --> 02:10.839
I call it selective participation.

02:12.037 --> 02:14.904
Now, Jessie, give me...

02:14.934 --> 02:16.902
Pouty nanny.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.597
Okay, that was more like constipated nanny,

02:20.637 --> 02:22.705
but I can touch it up.

02:22.735 --> 02:24.703
I can't believe I can get school credit

02:24.733 --> 02:26.601
for taking pictures of cute girls.

02:26.631 --> 02:30.536
The assignment is to take pictures
of New York's flora and fauna.

02:30.566 --> 02:32.704
Ooh, I hope those are hot Latin twins.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.970
Do you have an off switch?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.796
Yep. You wanna
try and find it?

02:38.836 --> 02:39.865
Nope.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.960
Okay, look.
We are going to the park.

02:47.936 --> 02:50.833
or a slither, or whatever he does.

02:50.863 --> 02:53.559
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:53.599 --> 02:55.967
We cannot take
Mr. Kipling for a walk.

02:55.997 --> 02:58.963
If Mrs. Chesterfield sees him,
she'll throw a hissy fit.

02:58.993 --> 03:00.861
Yeah, she's the head of the condo board.

03:00.891 --> 03:03.897
And a real pain in the ashram.

03:03.927 --> 03:06.664
Oh, is she that annoying lady downstairs

03:06.694 --> 03:08.692
who's always carrying that homely baby?

03:08.732 --> 03:09.930
It's a dog.

03:11.499 --> 03:12.697
You're telling me.

03:12.727 --> 03:15.694
Someone whomped that child
with the ugly stick.

03:15.724 --> 03:17.761
He means it's a Chihuahua.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.929
It's Chi-hideous.

03:19.959 --> 03:22.726
Look, Ravi, I'm not gonna
let some old grouch

03:22.756 --> 03:24.554
keep you from walking your pet.

03:24.594 --> 03:26.521
We'll just ask Tony to make
sure the coast is clear.

03:26.561 --> 03:27.820
<i>I'm on it!</i>

03:29.827 --> 03:32.694
Tony, are you eavesdropping again?

03:32.724 --> 03:34.822
<i>Now that I've looked up</i>
<i>the word... Yes.</i>

03:37.589 --> 03:38.857
I need a loaf of bread,

03:38.887 --> 03:40.725
a pound of cheddar cheese,

03:40.755 --> 03:42.753
two pounds of roast beef,

03:42.793 --> 03:44.790
a jumbo jar of mayonnaise...

03:44.820 --> 03:47.917
Bertram, when you are
done ordering your lunch,

03:49.884 --> 03:52.751
do not forget to order
Mr. Kipling's snack.

03:52.791 --> 03:55.488
Fine. Do you have
any frog legs?

03:56.886 --> 03:58.584
He does not like the legs.

04:00.582 --> 04:02.789
How about frog breasts?

04:04.817 --> 04:06.455
Can I buy those?

04:07.454 --> 04:09.482
Um, that's my business.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.719
Hello?

04:11.749 --> 04:14.446
Hello?

04:14.486 --> 04:16.553
And now I have to find a new grocer.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.579
All right.
Les go.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.577
Come on, come on, come on.
Move it, move it, move it!

04:21.618 --> 04:23.386
Go, go, go!
Come on!

04:23.416 --> 04:24.684
All right. You have this
and you have your camera.

04:24.714 --> 04:25.713
Whoa!

04:26.812 --> 04:28.450
Keep your tail to yourself.

04:29.618 --> 04:31.576
Yeah. She's mine.

04:31.616 --> 04:32.685
No, I'm not.

04:32.715 --> 04:35.512
All my boyfriends have to be at least 18.

04:35.552 --> 04:36.580
And human.

04:37.779 --> 04:40.446
So, Luke, you're oh for two.

04:47.408 --> 04:48.676
Go, go, go!

04:50.674 --> 04:53.780
Hey there,
Mrs. Chesterfield.

04:53.810 --> 04:55.449
That was a short walk.

04:55.479 --> 04:57.746
I know.
But, we're tired today.

04:57.776 --> 05:03.240
Last night, the noise from those
urchins upstairs was intolerable.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.447
Wasn't it, my little chimichanga?

05:05.477 --> 05:07.505
Yes. Give Mommy
a kiss. Yes.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.477
Hey! No PDA in the lobby.

05:16.304 --> 05:17.743
Well, better go get your beauty rest.

05:20.410 --> 05:21.638
Here we go!

05:28.440 --> 05:29.539
It's all clear.
You can come out now.

05:33.604 --> 05:36.371
Luke, you couldn't hold
it till we got outside?

05:36.401 --> 05:38.539
Hey, it wasn't me.
It was Mr. Kipling!

05:40.536 --> 05:43.303
Oh sure.
Blame the lizard.

05:48.607 --> 05:52.603
Jessie, thank you so much for bringing Mr.
Kipling to the park.

05:52.632 --> 05:54.530
Look how happy he is.

05:56.738 --> 05:58.566
Ever noticed how his happy face

05:58.606 --> 06:01.432
and his "I'm gonna eat you"
face are really similar?

06:03.400 --> 06:05.538
Ooh! Ha! Cockroach.

06:07.495 --> 06:09.603
Luke, help me, or I'll tell Jessie

06:09.633 --> 06:12.200
you still sleep with Kenny the Koala.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.397
Kenny just likes to hang out on my bed.

06:14.437 --> 06:16.395
Don't turn it into something ugly.

06:18.303 --> 06:19.501
Okay, okay.

06:22.398 --> 06:24.396
Oh, man! No way!

06:24.436 --> 06:25.465
What?

06:25.495 --> 06:28.431
I can see right into Bertram's room.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.528
Oh, he's shaving his own back.

06:31.567 --> 06:32.566
Ew.

06:33.465 --> 06:35.593
I wanna look away, but I can't!

06:37.531 --> 06:39.498
Oh, good.

06:39.528 --> 06:41.396
A giant bird just blocked my view.

06:41.426 --> 06:43.264
What? Let me see.

06:45.631 --> 06:49.327
I think that giant bird
is a Hudson Valley hawk!

06:49.357 --> 06:51.395
This book says they're incredibly rare.

06:51.425 --> 06:52.623
Not as rare as a guy shaving his back

06:52.663 --> 06:55.290
with a razor duct-taped
to a spatula.

06:57.388 --> 06:59.395
Jessie! Come help me!

07:00.354 --> 07:03.121
Zuri! Zuri!
What happened?

07:03.161 --> 07:05.388
This mean girl, Genevieve, hit me!

07:05.428 --> 07:07.356
What? Where is she?

07:07.386 --> 07:10.522
She's right there, sticking
her tongue out at you.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.087
Oh, I get it.

07:15.127 --> 07:17.484
Genevieve, that's not very nice.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.422
She's over there.

07:23.258 --> 07:26.224
Genevieve, apologize.
Right now.

07:27.483 --> 07:30.250
See, Zuri?
She said she's very sorry.

07:30.290 --> 07:32.217
No, she didn't.

07:32.257 --> 07:33.386
Then what did she say?

07:33.416 --> 07:36.323
I'm not allowed to use
that kind of language.

07:36.353 --> 07:38.151
But it was nasty.

07:42.386 --> 07:44.413
You can bring
Mr. Kipling back now.

07:44.453 --> 07:47.050
Mrs. Chesterfield's
not here.

07:51.455 --> 07:54.182
Mrs. Chesterfield!
You're here!

07:56.050 --> 07:57.278
Who's avoiding me?

07:57.318 --> 07:59.316
Uh, pretty much everyone in the building.

08:00.315 --> 08:02.183
You scare people.

08:04.380 --> 08:07.147
There goes my Christmas tip.

08:08.086 --> 08:09.315
Here's a tip.

08:09.345 --> 08:12.211
When the president of the condo
board asks you something,

08:12.251 --> 08:13.250
answer it.

08:14.149 --> 08:16.117
What's going on?

08:16.147 --> 08:19.982
Whatever it is, it has nothing
to do with a giant lizard.

08:28.383 --> 08:32.378
You people have a vicious, cold-blooded
reptile living in this building?

08:32.408 --> 08:34.405
Why not?
You live here.

08:37.172 --> 08:39.879
Zuri, that's not nice.

08:39.909 --> 08:42.047
Hey, we were all thinking it.

08:44.044 --> 08:46.112
Hi, I'm Jessie.
And I...

08:46.142 --> 08:47.341
I don't care.
Okay.

08:50.037 --> 08:53.274
Giant lizards are not
allowed in this building!

08:53.304 --> 08:55.241
Tony, help me!

08:57.169 --> 08:59.137
I meant by the waist!

08:59.177 --> 09:03.272
Oh, put me down, you
charmingly boyish troglodyte!

09:05.170 --> 09:07.238
Whoa! Language!

09:08.976 --> 09:12.202
Please, Mrs. Chesterfield,
do not take away my pet.

09:12.242 --> 09:14.799
Pet? That's not a pet!

09:14.839 --> 09:16.936
That is the before picture
of a pair of boots.

09:16.966 --> 09:18.205
And a matching belt.

09:20.103 --> 09:21.831
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:31.969 --> 09:33.797
Oops.

09:33.837 --> 09:35.165
You took the wrong leash.

09:37.163 --> 09:38.931
Oh, did I?

09:40.899 --> 09:44.095
Thanks for the news flash, Bessie!

09:44.135 --> 09:46.033
Oh, my little Zeusie!

09:49.069 --> 09:51.796
Jessie, I cannot lose
Mr. Kipling!

09:51.836 --> 09:53.834
He is my best friend!

09:53.864 --> 09:54.962
I'm so sorry, Ravi.

09:55.002 --> 09:57.060
If I hadn't suggested taking Mr.
Kipling for a walk,

09:57.100 --> 09:58.868
this never would have happened.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.833
I agree. If only you could've
had this a-ha moment earlier.

10:17.077 --> 10:19.544
Ugh! That stupid hawk
won't move.

10:21.492 --> 10:25.547
Why have you added 10 pounds
of rodent to my shopping list?

10:25.577 --> 10:28.244
A sudden craving for mice krispie treats?

10:30.012 --> 10:31.910
We need bait to get the hawk to fly

10:31.950 --> 10:34.047
so we can get an action
shot for our photo essay.

10:34.077 --> 10:37.174
But all it does is sit there like a lump.

10:37.214 --> 10:39.980
If it watched Korean soap
operas in its underwear,

10:40.010 --> 10:41.009
it would be you, Bertram.

10:41.039 --> 10:42.178
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

10:42.977 --> 10:44.206
Very funny.

10:44.246 --> 10:47.172
If you need me, I'll be inside
spitting in your lunch.

10:49.939 --> 10:52.007
Ravi, why you packing?

10:52.046 --> 10:53.245
You're not going anywhere.

10:53.275 --> 10:56.342
I will not be separated
from Mr. Kipling.

10:56.371 --> 10:58.839
We have been together since he was an egg.

10:58.879 --> 11:00.936
I actually sat on him until he hatched.

11:02.944 --> 11:05.271
I get it, okay?
He's a link to your old life.

11:05.311 --> 11:07.209
Just like I still have my first rattle.

11:07.239 --> 11:08.977
I cut it off the snake myself.

11:10.305 --> 11:14.001
Jessie! Genevieve followed
us from the playground.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.068
She just ripped off my dolly's head!

11:19.305 --> 11:22.002
Okay, that's scary.

11:22.042 --> 11:25.238
And you don't wanna see what
she did to my Build-a-Baboon.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.965
Now he'll never have children!

11:29.273 --> 11:30.972
Can I go work for him?

11:32.869 --> 11:35.097
Jessie, please come play with me.

11:35.137 --> 11:37.864
If you're there, Genevieve
won't pick on me.

11:37.904 --> 11:40.231
Zuri, I wish I could,

11:40.271 --> 11:42.968
but I need to help Ravi right now.

11:42.998 --> 11:45.195
Well, guess I know where I stand.

11:48.002 --> 11:51.967
Wait, Zuri, why don't you try
being nice to Genevieve?

11:51.997 --> 11:53.865
Why don't you tell her she's pretty?

11:53.895 --> 11:55.134
Have you seen her?

11:57.101 --> 11:59.928
Well... No.

11:59.968 --> 12:01.826
But you see her.

12:01.866 --> 12:04.193
And my advice is to kill her with kindness.

12:05.931 --> 12:08.898
Just like I'm going to do
with Mrs. Chesterfield.

12:10.066 --> 12:12.194
Do you know what
works better than kindness?

12:12.234 --> 12:14.791
A really big hammer.

12:19.865 --> 12:20.964
Hi!
Ugh.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.229
I brought cookies.

12:26.158 --> 12:28.026
What kind?

12:28.066 --> 12:30.193
They're "I'm sorry you almost
got eaten by a giant lizard,

12:30.223 --> 12:34.029
"but please let him stay 'cause it would
mean so much to a little boy" cookies.

12:34.059 --> 12:35.827
Pecan sandies!

12:36.825 --> 12:38.753
Well, maybe just one.

12:38.793 --> 12:40.162
It is our cheat day.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.059
Right, my little Zeusie?

12:42.089 --> 12:43.158
Come on.

12:45.196 --> 12:47.024
Binge with Mommy.

12:49.161 --> 12:50.819
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

12:55.154 --> 12:56.892
Ow!

12:56.922 --> 12:58.051
Uh, don't you mean "wow"?

12:58.091 --> 13:01.117
I just bit into a pecan shell!

13:01.157 --> 13:03.724
You broke my tooth!

13:03.754 --> 13:05.123
I'm so sorry!

13:05.153 --> 13:07.890
You were supposed to love the
cookies so we could bond...

13:07.919 --> 13:11.016
The only bonding is gonna
be done by my dentist!

13:11.056 --> 13:12.984
And I'm sending you the bill!

13:14.951 --> 13:16.649
Fine, whatever.

13:16.689 --> 13:19.756
Just please, please don't
take Ravi's lizard away.

13:19.786 --> 13:21.084
I wouldn't dream of it.

13:21.114 --> 13:22.982
That's Animal Control's job.

13:23.022 --> 13:24.780
And I'm calling them right now.

13:28.955 --> 13:30.983
I should have brought a hammer.

13:31.922 --> 13:33.780
Do not worry, Mr. Kipling.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.746
Jessie is going to fix things with Mrs.
Chesterfield.

13:37.915 --> 13:39.753
Okay, don't panic.

13:40.752 --> 13:42.050
I broke
Mrs. Chesterfield's tooth,

13:42.080 --> 13:43.778
and she's calling Animal Control

13:43.818 --> 13:45.886
to come take
Mr. Kipling away.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.818
Okay...

13:52.848 --> 13:55.075
I hope that means that although
you're slightly upset,

13:55.115 --> 13:57.742
you don't blame me 'cause
you know I did my best.

13:57.782 --> 13:59.680
No.

13:59.710 --> 14:03.116
It means I curse the day you were
ever born, you bungling she-devil!

14:04.984 --> 14:06.082
Oh!

14:06.112 --> 14:08.779
Well, someone's not getting a cookie.

14:10.747 --> 14:12.914
I'm sorry, Jessie!
I did not mean it!

14:12.944 --> 14:14.013
It's okay.

14:14.043 --> 14:16.840
I just cannot bear
to see Mr. Kipling so upset.

14:21.914 --> 14:25.680
You know, he hides
his emotions really well.

14:25.710 --> 14:28.037
Look, Ravi, we have to get Mr.
Kipling out of the building!

14:28.077 --> 14:31.843
As I recall, your wanting to
get him out of the building

14:31.872 --> 14:36.607
is what started this spiral
of doom in the first place!

14:36.637 --> 14:39.044
Oh, okay, are we assigning blame here,

14:39.074 --> 14:40.942
or are we saving a lizard?

14:42.011 --> 14:43.969
I am doing a little bit of both.

14:50.002 --> 14:51.740
Tony, are we all clear?

14:51.769 --> 14:53.008
All clear.

14:53.038 --> 14:55.675
You're sure the Animal
Control guys aren't there?

14:55.705 --> 14:58.072
Yeah, I'm sure.
Geez, a guy makes one mistake...

14:59.940 --> 15:01.598
Aw, man!

15:03.866 --> 15:05.903
If you guys are looking for a large lizard,

15:05.933 --> 15:07.831
I can assure you it is not here.

15:07.871 --> 15:10.698
Lizards hate lobbies.
They prefer lounges.

15:12.635 --> 15:15.872
What is not clear to you
about the phrase "all clear"?

15:17.700 --> 15:20.596
It does seem fairly
self-explanatory.

15:22.864 --> 15:25.700
Come on! We gotta get Mr.
Kipling out of here until those guys leave.

15:25.730 --> 15:26.999
No problem.
He's already gone.

15:28.837 --> 15:30.734
Okay, don't panic!

15:37.497 --> 15:39.664
Okay, now, he's not very good in a crisis.

15:48.204 --> 15:50.971
Do I put frogs in the
refrigerator or the pantry?

15:52.210 --> 15:54.837
I don't know.
That's not my job.

15:56.495 --> 15:58.712
I never imagined it would be mine, either.

15:59.861 --> 16:01.259
Get the door.

16:07.102 --> 16:10.009
Hello, little girl.
May we come in?

16:10.289 --> 16:11.318
No.

16:12.556 --> 16:17.490
And Jessie says I'm not
supposed to talk to strangers.

16:17.820 --> 16:21.785
I'm Mrs. Chesterfield, from downstairs.
I'm not strange.

16:21.825 --> 16:23.623
That's a matter of opinion.

16:26.021 --> 16:27.988
Out of my way.

16:28.018 --> 16:30.815
You're strange and rude.

16:30.855 --> 16:32.683
And you have dog breath.

16:35.819 --> 16:37.527
Nothing to see here!

16:38.816 --> 16:40.654
A-ha!

16:40.684 --> 16:43.950
If there's no giant lizard
living in this apartment,

16:43.980 --> 16:46.587
then how do you explain this?

16:47.046 --> 16:50.013
It's an indoor playground.

16:50.053 --> 16:53.619
Guess they didn't have those
around when you were a kid.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.915
How dare you!

16:56.945 --> 16:59.512
I'm only 32.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.681
Maybe in dog years.

17:05.885 --> 17:08.781
So you're claiming
this contraption is yours?

17:08.810 --> 17:10.509
Absolutely.

17:11.678 --> 17:13.915
It's mine! It's fun!

17:18.750 --> 17:21.506
And it doesn't smell bad in here at all.

17:23.544 --> 17:26.940
Well, then how do you explain all
these tiny animal skeletons?

17:28.678 --> 17:30.706
You have your hobbies and I have mine.

18:05.476 --> 18:07.403
Get any good shots of the hawk?

18:07.433 --> 18:08.902
Luke!

18:11.768 --> 18:12.767
Ow!

18:16.673 --> 18:18.501
Is Animal Control still up here?

18:18.541 --> 18:20.438
We lost Mr. Kipling!

18:20.468 --> 18:23.405
He's not lost.
He's right down there.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.771
And he looks like he's about to eat Mrs.
Chesterfield's stupid mutt.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.699
What?

18:32.664 --> 18:36.570
My complaint is that there is
still a vicious 7-foot lizard

18:36.600 --> 18:39.436
named Mr. Kipling running
amok in my building!

18:40.465 --> 18:43.701
No, I don't know his first name!

18:43.731 --> 18:47.567
Well, I don't care if that
leaves a blank on your form!

18:47.597 --> 18:49.535
You can take your form and...

18:49.565 --> 18:51.463
No, don't you put me on hold!

18:51.502 --> 18:52.701
And I'm on hold.

18:56.527 --> 18:57.595
Ugh!

18:58.494 --> 18:59.633
Nice to see you, too.

19:05.626 --> 19:08.563
Oh, my little Zeusie!
Mommy will save you!

19:08.593 --> 19:09.661
No, I won't.

19:12.558 --> 19:15.555
Okay, I'll bet you five bucks
the lizard eats the dog

19:15.595 --> 19:16.693
and Chesterfield.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.560
You're on. I bet she tastes
as bitter as she looks.

19:21.797 --> 19:23.755
The hawk is moving!
Give me the camera!

19:27.391 --> 19:28.759
It's diving straight toward us!

19:30.587 --> 19:32.495
I think it wants the Chihuahua!

19:32.525 --> 19:34.623
Hey, everybody loves Mexican.

19:42.693 --> 19:44.651
I got it!

19:44.691 --> 19:46.559
Now, that's an action shot!

19:50.554 --> 19:51.723
Oh!

19:51.753 --> 19:55.588
Wow! A giant lizard using
a hawk as a pinata!

19:55.618 --> 19:57.686
That's a first for me.
Anybody else?

19:58.655 --> 20:02.381
Oh, my little Zeusie!
Mommy has you.

20:02.421 --> 20:03.789
Oh, stop trembling.

20:04.748 --> 20:06.486
Oh, that's me.

20:07.315 --> 20:08.653
Oh!

20:08.683 --> 20:11.650
I'll call Zoya and book us an
emergency couples massage.

20:14.517 --> 20:17.753
Gee, it must feel pretty bad
almost losing your pet like that.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.520
It does.

20:20.550 --> 20:24.745
If I lost Zeus, who would I watch
<i>Real Housewives</i> with?

20:24.785 --> 20:27.611
So now you know how Ravi
feels about Mr. Kipling.

20:27.651 --> 20:31.347
You and Mr. Kipling watch <i>The Real
Housewives</i> <i>of New York,</i> too?

20:31.377 --> 20:32.516
Oh, absolutely.

20:32.546 --> 20:34.483
But if you want to see a real catfight,

20:34.513 --> 20:36.611
you should check out the <i>Real
Housewives</i> <i>of New Delhi.</i>

20:39.747 --> 20:42.544
See? See how
we're all bonding?

20:42.584 --> 20:45.381
So does this mean
Mr. Kipling can stay?

20:46.749 --> 20:48.477
I didn't say that.

20:48.517 --> 20:50.375
Oh, come on!

20:50.415 --> 20:52.712
If it weren't for his lizard, right
now, your dog would be a yappy meal.

20:56.578 --> 20:58.676
All right.
Yes!

20:58.715 --> 21:02.311
Just promise to keep that
disturbing creature away from me.

21:02.341 --> 21:04.509
Deal. You will never
see Mr. Kipling again.

21:04.539 --> 21:06.447
I was talking about Zuri.

21:06.476 --> 21:08.404
She's a very strange child.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.536
Zuri!

21:15.576 --> 21:16.705
She's not here!

21:19.671 --> 21:22.408
Oh, really?
Hmm. That's too bad,

21:22.438 --> 21:24.436
'cause I have some good news.

21:24.476 --> 21:26.603
What?

21:26.643 --> 21:29.570
Genevieve is not going to
be bothering you anymore.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.508
Because Mr. Kipling
ate her.

21:34.634 --> 21:36.242
Really?

21:36.272 --> 21:37.371
Did she suffer?

21:38.470 --> 21:39.568
No, sweetie.

21:39.608 --> 21:40.707
Too bad.

21:42.675 --> 21:44.602
This stinks!

21:44.632 --> 21:47.639
Luke and I got an A on our photo essay!

21:47.669 --> 21:51.604
What's wrong with an A?
Again, not seeing the problem.

21:51.634 --> 21:55.400
The problem is I did all the work
but Luke got all the credit!

21:55.440 --> 21:57.498
I watched that stupid hawk like a...

21:57.537 --> 22:00.164
Hawk all day,

22:00.204 --> 22:03.171
and all Luke did was
snap one lucky picture!

22:03.201 --> 22:05.199
Hey, did Emma tell you my picture made

22:05.239 --> 22:07.296
the homepage of the school website?

22:07.336 --> 22:09.304
All my hard work really paid off!

22:13.569 --> 22:15.497
All right, all right.

22:15.537 --> 22:17.534
Here's dinner.

22:17.564 --> 22:20.431
Breast of frog
wild mice. f.

22:20.461 --> 22:22.159
Ew!

22:22.199 --> 22:23.368
Just kidding.
It's chicken.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.495
Maybe.
