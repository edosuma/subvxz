00:00.301 --> 00:01.333
♪ Hey ♪

00:05.072 --> 00:08.440
This is weird. Sir Gareth's
never late for class.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.109
I hope he's okay.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.782
He is definitely not okay.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.021
Are we just gonna pretend
we don't see him?

00:22.123 --> 00:25.024
This is for today's
lesson, how to capture...

00:25.126 --> 00:26.625
a Pegasus!

00:28.729 --> 00:31.397
The squad that gets the
most lassos around me wins.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.165
When I trample you,

00:33.267 --> 00:34.466
when I fly,

00:34.568 --> 00:36.268
be prepared for anything!

00:38.806 --> 00:40.439
I can't fly.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.145
Okay, be ready for
when he comes back.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.583
Oh, look, it's a Pegasus herd.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.751
What a coincidence...

00:52.853 --> 00:55.421
and/or a thing I
meticulously planned.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.729
It looks like a rainbow,

01:03.831 --> 01:05.998
but it smells like
a rainbow's butt.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.736
It's Pegasus poop. Ha!

01:10.838 --> 01:12.905
Sage taught a herd of Pegasuses
to potty on command.

01:13.007 --> 01:14.807
And I taught them how to love.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.745
And now, since you dummies
are a little distracted,

01:19.847 --> 01:21.013
we're gonna do this.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.419
Ah!

01:28.689 --> 01:29.855
Ahhhhh!

01:29.957 --> 01:33.092
You have tamed the wild beast.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.460
Kraken Squad wins.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.665
Unicorn Squad, comes in second.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.133
And bringing up the rear,

01:41.235 --> 01:43.302
and smelling like
it, Phoenix Squad.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.672
Let's see where
each squad stands

01:46.774 --> 01:48.974
on their road to knighthood.

01:53.047 --> 01:55.481
That put us in last place?

01:55.583 --> 01:58.550
Sorry, guys. That stinks.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.352
Get it? 'Cause you smell bad.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.620
Ha!

02:01.722 --> 02:03.889
Stink has two meanings.
I know that now.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.094
Sir Gareth, this isn't fair.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.941
Yeah, the only reason we
lost that last challenge

02:10.965 --> 02:13.065
is because Sage covered
us in Pegasus poop.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.834
If I gave up every
time I was pooped on,

02:15.936 --> 02:17.736
I wouldn't be the
proud man I am today.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.873
We're never gonna
become knights,

02:20.975 --> 02:22.307
if Sage pranks us every class.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.543
Yeah, yesterday, she
magnetized our swords,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.178
and we stuck together.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.081
Yeah, and last week,
she put rubber tips

02:29.183 --> 02:31.450
on our arrows, so they
bounced back at us.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.519
I almost lost an eye.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.822
Which would only make
me more handsome.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.027
She has no honor, Sir Gareth.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.263
Sage breaks the knights'
code like every day.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.566
You make a valid point.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.745
There's a pattern of behavior

02:48.769 --> 02:50.836
that is unacceptable
for a knight.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.174
I will bring her mom in for a
parent/teacher conference,

02:55.276 --> 02:58.010
and let her know that
Sage is being expelled.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.947
Whoa.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.616
Expelled?

03:04.718 --> 03:06.251
I thought Sage was
just gonna have to

03:06.353 --> 03:08.220
climb to the top of the
Time Out beanstalk.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.557
Is that just a giant thing?

03:13.794 --> 03:16.862
I mean, are we sure
we wanna do this?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.365
Ah, poop!

03:20.467 --> 03:21.733
- Yes!
- Sure!

03:21.835 --> 03:22.968
Definitely!

03:23.070 --> 03:24.469
Oh, it went in my eye.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.639
- ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ - Hey!

03:27.741 --> 03:29.374
- ♪ Oh oh ♪ - Hey!

03:29.476 --> 03:31.510
Maybe I should clean
these marbles up

03:31.612 --> 03:33.045
before something bad happens.

03:33.147 --> 03:35.480
Whoa!

03:35.583 --> 03:37.082
Too late!

03:37.184 --> 03:41.653
Ah! I think I dented
my metal butt cheek.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.722
Oh...

03:43.824 --> 03:47.226
Oh, I have to postpone our snack
shopping trip for knight school.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.127
I have a parent/
teacher conference.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.696
Ooh, let me do the shopping.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.130
You can't do that.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.199
For one, you're just a kid.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.634
And?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.502
That's it. You're just a kid.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.584
Controlling the knight
school snack fund

04:00.608 --> 04:02.541
is a huge responsibility.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.909
Please, Sir Gareth?

04:04.011 --> 04:05.844
Don't make me go
puppy dog on you.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.816
Your eyes are just so big!

04:10.918 --> 04:13.051
Okay, I'll give you a chance.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.654
In here is enough to get
everything on this list.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.024
I won't let you down, sir.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.392
Oh, uh, and don't forget to get

04:21.495 --> 04:23.206
the cocoa doodles for
my secret snack stash.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.796
You have a secret snack stash?

04:24.898 --> 04:25.964
No.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.599
And don't you touch it!

04:29.870 --> 04:31.637
Hey, kid!

04:31.739 --> 04:32.971
Do you like chicken nuggets?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.974
Only more than everything.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.777
I have a magic chicken nugget

04:38.879 --> 04:40.912
that grows into a
chicken nugget tree.

04:41.015 --> 04:42.447
Would you like that?

04:42.549 --> 04:44.650
E-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!

04:46.720 --> 04:49.855
I'd never need to buy
knight school snacks again.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.424
I'd be Sir Gareth's hero.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.825
Wanna be my hero?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.360
Gimme the money.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.532
What a big, green dummy.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.967
I woulda paid double.

05:08.242 --> 05:09.274
Huzzah!

05:09.376 --> 05:10.776
Wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.711
Huzzah was my catchphrase.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.547
Yours is
Wickety-Wickety-Warwick.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.016
Oh, yeah, my bad, man.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.020
Guys, let's leave before
Sage's mom gets here

05:22.122 --> 05:23.955
for the parent/
teacher conference.

05:24.058 --> 05:26.992
Too late, she's already here.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.593
Get outta sight!

05:31.598 --> 05:34.866
Sage, who are these
annoying shield jockeys?

05:34.968 --> 05:37.269
Mom, people I hate.
People I hate, Mom.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.672
Hi.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.909
So, I don't know what Sir Gareth

05:44.011 --> 05:45.011
called you in here for,

05:45.112 --> 05:46.778
but I didn't do it.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.047
Mommy is going to
take care of it.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.116
Mommy always takes care of it.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.654
Sage. Sage's Mom.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.357
Please, call me Saffron.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.461
Sage always raves about
the legendary Sir Gareth.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.698
- I do?
- She does.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.834
Ah, please, step into my office.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.736
Sage, you can wait here.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.204
I'll be here...

06:12.306 --> 06:14.406
not causing any trouble...

06:14.508 --> 06:17.542
figuring out how you losers
caused this meeting.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.211
She's onto us! Hide!

06:21.982 --> 06:24.149
I knew it. You all
ratted me out!

06:24.251 --> 06:25.684
We had to, all right?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.530
Your pranks are keeping
us from becoming knights,

06:27.554 --> 06:31.156
and we're pretty sure you
gave Warwick Pegasus eye.

06:31.258 --> 06:34.059
Everything looks like rainbows.

06:35.863 --> 06:39.131
We're fed up and we can't wait
for justice to be served.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.633
How long do we have to wait
for justice to be served?

06:43.337 --> 06:45.137
I don't know. Why are
they still in there?

06:47.341 --> 06:48.907
Saffron, thank you
for the beautiful

06:49.009 --> 06:50.942
griffon claw medallion
for my eyepatch.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.177
It suits you.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.379
It really brings out
your other eye.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.748
- Oh!
- BOTH:

06:59.853 --> 07:00.952
This seems like a weird way

07:01.054 --> 07:03.121
to tell Sage she's kicked out.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.856
Sage, kicked out?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.358
Don't be ridiculous.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.493
I could never kick out
Saffron's daughter.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.195
For real?

07:10.297 --> 07:13.432
I mean, of course, you wouldn't.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.400
Why?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.003
Because...

07:18.105 --> 07:20.772
I'm in love!!!

07:20.874 --> 07:23.508
You are too much, Sir Gorgeous.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.310
- Who's too much?
- I'm too much.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.679
- Who are you?
- I'm too much.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.316
You're simply much too gorgeous!

07:31.418 --> 07:32.984
This can't be happening.

07:34.555 --> 07:38.457
With my mom dating Sir Gareth,
I'm gonna be untouchable.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.292
Oh, what's the word
I'm looking for?

07:40.394 --> 07:42.627

We were supposed to get Sage
kicked out of knight school,

08:18.699 --> 08:20.232
not give her more
power than ever.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.534
Yeah, and they can't keep their
noses off of each other.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.243
Oh, yes, of course. Of course.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.611
Attention, students.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.946
My Saffy-Waffy hates
the name Warwick.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.383
So, anyone named Warwick
will now be called Seawick.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.121
Aw, man, I have to
relabel my underwear.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.225
Oh, yeah, Ciara, let's
see what you can do

08:47.327 --> 08:50.195
in a hatchet-throwing
competition against Sage.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.331
She could win this competition
with her eyes closed.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.301
Please keep your eyes open.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.738
Three, two...

08:59.840 --> 09:01.172
I love you, Saffron.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.140
And throw!

09:02.242 --> 09:03.708
CIARA & SAGE:

09:03.810 --> 09:05.043
Yes! Bullseye!

09:05.145 --> 09:07.112
That was for you, Seawick.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.447
Sage wins!

09:09.550 --> 09:11.816
What?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.885
That doesn't seem fair.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.221
But I'll take it.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.123
But I was closer to the middle.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.592
True, but her mother is
closest to my heart.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.127
Oh, Gare-Bear.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.662
- You shouldn't have.
- Oh!

09:23.764 --> 09:24.996
Get your trophy.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.001
If Sir Gareth keeps letting
Sage win everything,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.436
we'll never become knights.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.738
Our only hope is to break
up Sir Gareth and Saffron.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.340
And, while we're at it,

09:35.442 --> 09:37.509
maybe we get the princess
together with Warwick?

09:39.313 --> 09:40.345
Who's Warwick?

09:44.651 --> 09:45.750
♪ Oh oh oh ♪

09:45.852 --> 09:48.086
♪ Ah ah ah ah ♪

09:48.188 --> 09:49.554
Come on, nugget, grow!

09:49.656 --> 09:52.557
I've got hungry knights to feed!

09:52.659 --> 09:54.225
Hi, Fizz. Hi, dirt bucket.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.130
Hey, Buttercup, aren't you
supposed to be at knight school?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.732
Nope. Sage's mom told Sir Gareth

10:00.834 --> 10:02.033
to give me the day off.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.602
So, I went for a walk,

10:03.704 --> 10:04.704
then I followed a beetle,

10:04.738 --> 10:05.937
and now I'm here.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.106
What's wrong?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.709
I planted a magic chicken nugget

10:10.811 --> 10:12.243
and it's not sprouting.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.679
I bought a magic nugget once
from an ogre named Greg.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.814
Did yours grow?

10:15.916 --> 10:18.817
Nope, but then I
bought his magic soil.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.118
And that worked?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.920
Nopety nope.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.089
I'm pretty sure the soil
was just cookie crumbs.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.259
Greg tricked me.

10:28.362 --> 10:31.963
If Sir Gareth finds out
I lost his snack money,

10:32.065 --> 10:34.432
he'll think I'm an
irresponsible little kid.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.368
Maybe you need a moustache.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.403
People respect you when
you have a moustache.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.571
Just ask my mom.

10:43.377 --> 10:46.077
I'm gonna go find that ogre
and get my money back!

10:46.179 --> 10:48.213
Yeah! And I'll help you.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.149
That ogre's about to see
a really angry bust.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.189
So, how are we gonna
break them up?

10:57.224 --> 10:58.434
With the knight
school policy manual.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.492
Good idea. We're gonna smack
the love out of them.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.830
Oh, look, the Phoenix
Squad is here.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.133
Mother, glare at them with me.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.571
Sir Gareth, do you
have a minute?

11:13.674 --> 11:14.773
- Do I?
- No.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.174
I do not.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.057
Sir Gareth, your
feelings for Saffron

11:19.146 --> 11:20.311
are clouding your judgment

11:20.414 --> 11:22.847
and it's against
the school policy.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.750
No instructor shall date

11:25.852 --> 11:28.653
or canoodle with a
student's parents."

11:28.755 --> 11:31.456
Oh, no. Our love is forbidden.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.626
Right again, sweetums.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.194
I will no longer be canoodling

11:36.296 --> 11:37.962
with the mother of a student.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.330
You go, Gare-Bear.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.747
That's because Sage will no
longer be a student here.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.202
You're... you're kicking me out?

11:44.304 --> 11:47.839
Oh, no, I'm making you a knight.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.541
Yes, we did it!

11:49.643 --> 11:50.675
Wait! What?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.145
You shoulda smacked
'em with the book.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.120
♪ Na na na na na na na ♪

12:02.222 --> 12:04.055
Let's not be stingy
with the decorations,

12:04.157 --> 12:06.091
Phony Squad.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.159
It's Phoenix Squad.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.694
No one cares, Seawick.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.165
Just make sure that
everything is perfect

12:14.267 --> 12:16.134
for my daughter's knighting.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.571
She's so much better than you.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.075
She was supposed
to be thrown out.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.343
This is so not fair.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.778
I had no idea that love

12:26.880 --> 12:28.813
could make Sir Gareth so crazy.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.782
This isn't love.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.150
Somehow Sage is behind this,

12:32.252 --> 12:33.651
and I'm gonna figure out how.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.590
So, I guess she's quitting
the decorating committee?

12:38.692 --> 12:40.158
Must be nice.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.573
Stay still for your
armor fitting.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.096
Mommy went through
a lot of trouble

12:45.198 --> 12:46.264
to make this happen.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.665
No one asked you to.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.735
Uh, uh, uh, listen to
your mother, dear.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.638
She knows what's best for
our new little family.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.406
Ooooh!

12:55.509 --> 12:56.908
Barf.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.080
Did anybody else see that?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.382
Yeah, Sir Gareth's
twirling again.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.485
Oh, I'm in love!!!

13:07.587 --> 13:09.320
I was talking about Sage.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.489
She sure didn't seem
into being knighted.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.490
Something's up.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.736
Yeah, we need to snoop around

13:13.760 --> 13:15.338
and figure out what's
happening with her.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.628
Let's get out of here now.

13:16.730 --> 13:19.397
Sir Gareth's doing
some of a love buggy.

13:31.578 --> 13:35.446
We are not happy with your
business practices, Greg!

13:37.384 --> 13:39.184
Sorry to hear that, Buttercup.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.985
Hey, do you wanna
buy a magic mop

13:41.087 --> 13:43.421
that turns into a
koala bear at night?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.957
You bet I do!

13:46.059 --> 13:47.358
Buttercup, focus!

13:50.130 --> 13:51.796
I want my money back.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.364
No refunds, little kid.

13:53.466 --> 13:57.202
So, go enjoy the giant booger I
painted to look like a nugget.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.875
Fizz, he said no, after
we politely asked.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.343
There's nothing else we can do.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.780
There's one thing.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.149
Hey, Greg!

14:11.251 --> 14:13.117
I challenge you to a duel.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.588
You can't challenge
someone to a duel,

14:16.690 --> 14:18.957
unless you slap
'em with a glove.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.793
You didn't let me finish.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.331
Not cool!

14:31.338 --> 14:32.537
Ciara, I need to talk to you.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.873
But, first, what is
all this madness?

14:36.176 --> 14:38.276
On my evidence board,
as you can see,

14:38.378 --> 14:40.578
Sage is definitely at the
center of this whole thing.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.515
Oh, is that... is
that just because

14:44.618 --> 14:46.718
you put her picture in
the center of the board?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.221
Maybe.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.393
Okay, I know it may seem crazy,

14:55.495 --> 14:56.728
but I think that Sage might be

14:56.830 --> 14:59.130
just as unhappy about
this as we are.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.266
Why would you
possibly think that?

15:01.368 --> 15:03.134
Because...

15:03.236 --> 15:05.603
I am just as unhappy
about this as you are.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.506
You brought Sage
into our Squad Room?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.108
She's looking at my board!

15:10.210 --> 15:11.576
She knows we're onto her!

15:15.382 --> 15:16.981
Sage, tell Ciara why Sir Gareth

15:17.083 --> 15:19.884
is in love with your mom.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.953
He isn't in love with her.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.454
She has him under an evil spell.

15:27.961 --> 15:28.961
♪ Oh na na ♪

15:29.062 --> 15:31.462

So, the claw medallion

15:33.266 --> 15:34.832
my mom gave to Sir
Gareth is enchanted.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.868
It makes him think
he's in love with her,

15:36.970 --> 15:38.202
so, she can control him.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.005
Wait, so, she's nose
nuzzling him for you?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.607
That's a good mom.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.312
Telling your mom to put
a spell on Sir Gareth

15:47.414 --> 15:48.579
is not cool, Sage.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.382
I had nothing to do with it.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.650
I don't wanna be known as

15:52.752 --> 15:54.285
the girl who became a knight

15:54.387 --> 15:56.054
because her mom made it happen.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.789
Yeah, right.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.057
It's true.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.559
I wanna take down the best squad
in knight school on my own.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.261
Did you just compliment us?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.662
Yeah, I did!

16:04.764 --> 16:06.064
What are you gonna do about it?

16:06.166 --> 16:07.265
Say thank you, that's what!

16:07.367 --> 16:08.466
Why are you two yelling?

16:08.568 --> 16:09.801
I don't know!

16:11.738 --> 16:13.338
Okay, there's gotta be some way

16:13.440 --> 16:15.239
to snap Sir Gareth out
of your mom's spell.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.141
The only way is to take
the claw medallion

16:17.243 --> 16:18.609
off of his eyepatch.

16:18.712 --> 16:19.944
I'll never be able to do that.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.746
It's true. Sir Gareth's
a fighting machine,

16:21.848 --> 16:23.348
even though he's held together

16:23.450 --> 16:24.949
by rusty screws and bubblegum.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.254
Sage, maybe you can't
overpower Sir Gareth alone,

16:30.357 --> 16:33.157
but, together, the
five of us could.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.962
You'd work with me?

16:38.064 --> 16:40.042
I know what it's like to have
a larger-than-life parent

16:40.066 --> 16:43.134
who's always sticking their
nose in your business.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.469
You do?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.504
Because every time I ask
you about your family,

16:46.606 --> 16:48.573
you always just
change the subject.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.508
Speaking of which, how
gross is broccoli?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.744
Can I get a 'yuck'?

16:52.846 --> 16:54.512
Yuck is right.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.587
Okay, Fizz, he's bigger, meaner,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.055
and stronger than you.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.156
But I can still win, right?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.693
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.163
Are we doin' this or what?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.866
Yeah. We're doin' this.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.569
He's gonna chew
me like a nugget.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.707
Fizz, it's not too
late to back out.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.208
I can't.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.877
If I don't get the snack money,

17:25.979 --> 17:28.646
Sir Gareth will keep thinking
of me as a little kid.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.482
So what? You are a little kid.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.584
You're like three, right?

17:33.686 --> 17:36.687
- I'm ten.
- What?

17:36.790 --> 17:40.124
But you're right, I
am a little kid.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.260
And I can use that
to my advantage.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.563
Hey, ogre, you want
some, come get some.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.198
You asked for it.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.071
Hey, hold still and
let me pummel you.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.441
Bring it on, you overgrown
Brussels sprout.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.201
Welcome to the knighting
ceremony of Sage,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.636
daughter of Saffron,
the beautiful,

18:25.738 --> 18:27.705
who is the apple of
my one good eye.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.907
Yes. Yes, I'm gorgeous.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.142
Now move it along.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.113
Okay, remember the plan.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.215
When Sir Gareth raises his
sword to knight Sage,

18:37.317 --> 18:38.683
we lasso him like a Pegasus.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.763
Then Sage will grab the
medallion from his eyepatch.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.347
And then we'll do a
party to celebrate.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.223
Yeah, our decorating skills
shouldn't go to waste.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.758
Not that you helped, Ciara.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.261
Just get your lassos ready.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.799
Ah, by the power invested in me

18:54.901 --> 18:56.601
by the King of Astoria,

18:56.703 --> 19:00.238
I dub thee Sage, Knight of...

19:00.340 --> 19:02.106
Oh! What?

19:02.208 --> 19:05.743
I'm sorry, Sir Gareth,
this is for your own good.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.416
Don't let them ruin my
baby's big day, Sir Cuddly.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.388
We've got his wrist!
Our plan is working!

19:19.192 --> 19:20.525
Ahhhh! Oh!

19:20.627 --> 19:23.861
Our plan is not working.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.830
Don't worry, I'll get his legs.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.202
Just grab his legs!

19:33.806 --> 19:35.317
Sage, we've got him!
Get the medallion!

19:35.341 --> 19:36.574
- On it.
- What?

19:36.676 --> 19:37.975
You're part of this?

19:38.077 --> 19:40.478
I'm making all of your
dreams come true.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.913
I don't want you to.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.948
Okay, this ceremony is over.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.350
Sage, hurry up!

19:46.452 --> 19:48.853
He's starting to chew
through the rope!

19:51.858 --> 19:54.458
You really think you
know better than Mommy?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.594
Yes.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.229
I wanna earn
knighthood for myself.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.765
It'll mean more when I
beat these dummies.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.501
Hey, we're trying to help you.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.773
Say goodbye to your Saffy-Waffy.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.275
No-o-o-o-o!

20:11.377 --> 20:12.910
And to conclude,
Sage is expelled.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.748
Sweet mother of dragons,
what's happening?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.550
Saffron was using her medallion

20:19.652 --> 20:21.492
to make you love her, so
she could control you.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.120
You were a super-cute couple.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.857
How dare you use a spell

20:26.960 --> 20:28.693
to make me fall in love with you

20:28.795 --> 20:32.096
when I would date
you in a heartbeat.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.931
And still would, if
that's something

20:34.033 --> 20:36.067
you can see in the
future with me.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.002
- Pass.
- Okay.

20:38.104 --> 20:41.439
I nuzzled that man's
nose for you.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.407
Mom, that was your bad choice.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.245
I just can't with you right now.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.655
So, Sage's mom is a bat.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.691
I told you she wasn't right.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.728
She has a medallion that
turns her into a bat.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.129
She earned that right.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.532
Sage, I'm afraid I still
have to expel you

21:08.635 --> 21:10.301
for violating the knights' code.

21:10.403 --> 21:13.337
Actually, Sir Gareth...

21:13.439 --> 21:15.740
the Phoenix Squad would like
to withdraw the complaint.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.475
We want Sage to stay.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.877
Yeah, she actually
helped us save you.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.179
Sage could have easily let
her mom make her a knight,

21:22.282 --> 21:24.348
but she wanted to
earn it on her own.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.083
That's pretty honorable.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.786
Those do sound like the
actions of a knight.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.822
Sage can stay.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.324
Yes!

21:33.426 --> 21:34.692
Wow, that felt weird.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.864
I hope you're not
expecting a thank you.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.499
Thank you.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.434
You're welcome.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.969
Well, now that that's over,

21:45.071 --> 21:46.671
you're still in last place.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.540
Yeah, well, last place
is a blast place.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.375
