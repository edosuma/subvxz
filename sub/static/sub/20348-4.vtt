WEBVTT

01:33.970 --> 01:35.805
<i>Final boarding call for flight 87...</i>

01:41.394 --> 01:42.687
You two together?

01:45.356 --> 01:46.733
Yes, we are.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.027
Australia, huh? Long trip.

01:49.235 --> 01:53.114
Yes, it is. I have Global Entry.
Where's the pre-check line?

01:53.448 --> 01:55.200
It is right over there, ma'am.
Leave your shoes on.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.243
- No need to take your laptop out.
- Oh.

01:57.494 --> 01:59.496
Is it all right if I go with her? Uh...

01:59.662 --> 02:01.706
- I'm a cop, so...
- Do you have Global Entry?

02:02.540 --> 02:05.210
- No.
- Then you can't go with her.

02:08.379 --> 02:10.173
I'll just see you on the other side, okay?

02:15.220 --> 02:17.055
- Sir?
- Yeah...

02:20.058 --> 02:22.227
<i>This way, please. Single file.</i>

02:35.824 --> 02:37.116
Arms up, please.

02:46.584 --> 02:49.295
- Your watch.
- Oh, shit. Sorry.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.051
Just walk on around. Come back through.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.186
- Enjoy your flight.
- Thank you.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.445
<i>Come on. Hey, give it back.
You can't take it, no.</i>

03:14.612 --> 03:16.781
<i>- Look, no, no. No, you can't take it.
- Sir.</i>

03:16.948 --> 03:18.616
- No, it's my suit.
- Is there a problem here, sir?

03:18.783 --> 03:20.451
No, look,
it's not on the list of restricted items.

03:20.618 --> 03:22.412
Okay, look, there's gonna be
a nuclear event,

03:22.579 --> 03:24.664
and I'm entitled
to protect myself from fallout.

03:24.831 --> 03:26.708
<i>Okay? I'm missing my flight.</i>

03:26.875 --> 03:28.543
I need to get to Antarctica.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.044
I need to get to Antarctica!

03:33.089 --> 03:34.549
Another one bites the dust.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.236
Hey.

03:56.029 --> 03:57.071
Hi.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.160
Everything go okay?

04:02.535 --> 04:03.995
Yeah, absolutely.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.997
- You?
- Great.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.083
What are you smuggling?

04:10.001 --> 04:11.085
Sorry?

04:11.502 --> 04:12.670
You either didn't wanna wait
in line with me

04:12.837 --> 04:14.422
for an extra five minutes,
or you're smuggling something.

04:14.589 --> 04:15.840
So, what is it?

04:17.008 --> 04:18.217
Heroin?

04:19.385 --> 04:22.388
I have $20,000 in cash
strapped to my body.

04:32.065 --> 04:34.484
- Lock the door.
- What are you doing?

04:36.194 --> 04:37.987
I borrowed your duct tape.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.741
They would've seen it
if I walked through the scanner. Sorry.

04:42.825 --> 04:43.993
Why?

04:44.160 --> 04:47.205
It's illegal to travel out of the country
with more than 10 grand.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.957
Why didn't you just give me half?

04:49.707 --> 04:52.585
Huh. Help me get the tape off?

04:58.675 --> 05:00.051
Ooh.

05:03.221 --> 05:04.389
Ooh.

05:04.973 --> 05:06.849
You hiding anything else
you wanna tell me about?

05:08.893 --> 05:10.019
Maybe.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.683
<i>- How many?
- A hundred and nineteen.</i>

05:49.183 --> 05:50.184
<i>Jesus.</i>

05:50.351 --> 05:51.436
<i>They made these testimonials.</i>

05:51.602 --> 05:53.396
<i>They're standing there,
holding a newspaper</i>

05:53.563 --> 05:55.481
<i>like a hostage video.</i>

05:56.107 --> 05:58.276
<i>They, they gave their names,
so I looked them up</i>

05:58.443 --> 05:59.527
<i>just to see if any of them
were still around</i>

05:59.694 --> 06:01.904
<i>after they supposedly got into this thing.</i>

06:02.697 --> 06:05.283
<i>The thing that zaps them
with the radiation?</i>

06:05.450 --> 06:08.286
<i>Yes, honey, the thing
that zaps them with the radiation.</i>

06:10.455 --> 06:11.622
And were they?

06:12.290 --> 06:13.624
- Still there?
- No.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.835
Every single one of them
is unaccounted for.

06:16.127 --> 06:17.628
- Where'd they go?
- Nowhere.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.297
Well, I mean, they have to go somewhere.

06:19.464 --> 06:21.799
Not if they're being cremated.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.053
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the seat belt sign is now turned off,</i>

06:25.219 --> 06:27.013
<i>and you are free to move about the cabin.</i>

06:28.473 --> 06:30.558
So it's a sting operation.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.643
You give them the money.
They show you the thing.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.353
You see that it torches people.
Then you bust them.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.938
Right.

06:37.023 --> 06:39.192
But you don't have any jurisdiction
in Australia.

06:40.318 --> 06:41.527
That is technically true.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.494
The DSD didn't send you.

06:51.746 --> 06:52.830
So you've gone rogue?

06:53.414 --> 06:56.292
The DSD has their hands full
with the coming apocalypse.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.629
These assholes invited me personally,

06:59.796 --> 07:01.714
so I can take them down myself.

07:02.048 --> 07:03.633
They didn't know
you were a fraud investigator?

07:03.800 --> 07:04.842
No, they knew.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.677
They knew
pretty much everything, actually.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.683
Well, then they know about me.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.268
I'm sure they do.

07:15.103 --> 07:16.687
And they still think
you're gonna get into this thing?

07:23.694 --> 07:26.030
And what if they ask
why I came down here with you?

07:28.366 --> 07:29.742
I'll say

07:30.576 --> 07:32.495
that you've come to see me off

07:32.662 --> 07:36.332
because we're
in a toxic codependent relationship,

07:36.707 --> 07:38.876
and we've both come to realize
that we're better off

07:39.043 --> 07:40.336
apart than together.

08:10.408 --> 08:11.659
<i>You gonna look your dad up?</i>

08:11.826 --> 08:13.703
- Look him up?
- Yeah.

08:13.953 --> 08:15.872
I thought that's why you wanted
to come down here.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.416
No, I came down here to be with you.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.376
<i>Yeah, but if he's close by...</i>

08:20.543 --> 08:22.128
Honey, I don't know where he is.

08:22.295 --> 08:24.589
And if he wanted me to know,
he would've fucking told me.

08:26.174 --> 08:27.300
Gotcha.

08:32.889 --> 08:34.599
You brought your book.

08:42.607 --> 08:44.108
It's not my book. It's Matt's.

08:44.275 --> 08:46.319
- But it's about you.
- Uh-huh.

08:48.112 --> 08:49.780
Are you finally gonna read it?

08:50.823 --> 08:53.534
- I already did.
- Really? When?

08:54.035 --> 08:56.162
On the plane when you were asleep.

08:56.621 --> 08:57.788
The whole thing?

08:58.497 --> 09:00.917
<i>The whole thing.</i>

09:02.460 --> 09:04.879
"And so He left the bridge
and the hangman behind.

09:05.046 --> 09:08.132
"And when He went into the woods,
He lifted the girl to His shoulder,

09:08.299 --> 09:10.593
"and she slept.
She pressed to Him and He to her..."

09:10.760 --> 09:12.595
He capitalizes your H's.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.473
"Now the sun rose,
and they had come to a well,

09:15.932 --> 09:18.809
"and He placed the girl
down upon its edge and..."

09:22.563 --> 09:23.564
What?

09:23.814 --> 09:25.942
If you read the whole thing,
what happens next?

09:31.155 --> 09:32.281
He pushed her in.

09:33.783 --> 09:34.825
Jesus.

09:35.326 --> 09:37.286
Where does Matt come up with this stuff?

09:38.496 --> 09:41.666
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

09:42.667 --> 09:44.585
Fuck. That's them.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.507
- Yes?
<i>- Is this Nora?</i>

09:49.674 --> 09:51.175
Yes, it is. Who's this?

09:51.342 --> 09:53.177
<i>There's a bus stop across the street
from the hotel.</i>

09:53.344 --> 09:56.138
<i>The 570 will arrive in about 15 minutes.</i>

09:56.305 --> 09:58.140
<i>Take it to the last stop. Don't miss it.</i>

09:58.307 --> 09:59.642
<i>We won't wait. Goodbye, Ms. Durst.</i>

09:59.809 --> 10:01.227
What? I don't...

10:02.603 --> 10:04.188
- That was them. I have to go.
- Where?

10:04.355 --> 10:06.023
I don't know.
They want me to get on a bus.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.401
- You want me to go with you?
- I'll be fine.

10:11.237 --> 10:12.446
Are you gonna follow me, Kevin?

10:13.197 --> 10:15.366
Yeah.

10:15.866 --> 10:19.203
Look, I have to do this alone, okay?

10:20.705 --> 10:21.706
Okay.

10:22.081 --> 10:24.500
Just take your nap. I'll be safe.

10:26.377 --> 10:27.378
Okay.

10:28.421 --> 10:29.463
Dinner later?

10:30.089 --> 10:31.299
Yeah, sure.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.259
I'll be back soon.

11:00.578 --> 11:01.579
God, motherfucker.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.083
<i>G'day, Melbourne!
It's a beautiful Tuesday,</i>

11:06.250 --> 11:07.251
<i>and I'm Pam Jolly.</i>

11:07.418 --> 11:08.502
<i>And I'm Bruce Quartermain.</i>

11:08.711 --> 11:12.590
<i>Today is October 9th,
and I have to say I'm a bit groggy.</i>

11:12.882 --> 11:15.593
<i>- Ooh, how was your night, Bruce?
- Oh, I had a big night last night.</i>

11:15.760 --> 11:16.761
<i>Did you go to the party?</i>

11:16.927 --> 11:20.264
<i>Well, I went to Melbourne's
Spring Fashion Ball last night.</i>

11:20.473 --> 11:23.017
<i>Ooh. Tell us. Tell us.
Did you wear a costume?</i>

11:23.184 --> 11:25.227
<i>Well, the theme this year
was under the sea...</i>

11:25.394 --> 11:26.479
<i>Good morning. Front desk.</i>

11:26.645 --> 11:28.647
Yeah, I can't turn off my television.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.399
I can't see where it's plugged in.

11:30.566 --> 11:31.776
<i>Yeah, so sorry about that.</i>

11:31.942 --> 11:33.944
<i>It's powered from the wall.
Happens sometimes.</i>

11:34.111 --> 11:37.073
<i>I can reset it from down here.
It'll just be a moment, Mr. Durst.</i>

11:37.448 --> 11:40.618
- It's Mr. Garvey.
<i>- Oh, so sorry.</i>

11:40.785 --> 11:42.453
<i>Uh, would you like us
to add your name to the room</i>

11:42.620 --> 11:44.622
<i>so you can have access
to all the guest amenities?</i>

11:44.789 --> 11:46.540
Yes, that would be great. Thank you.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.669
<i>Well, I'm ashamed to say that I did, Pam,</i>

11:50.836 --> 11:54.340
<i>but at least I get to be having pancakes
with you here this morning, right?</i>

11:54.507 --> 11:55.674
<i>Do you like pancakes, Bruce?</i>

11:55.841 --> 11:57.385
<i>Well, now, who doesn't like pancakes?</i>

11:57.551 --> 11:59.512
<i>Well, no one in their right mind,
that's what I say,</i>

11:59.678 --> 12:02.848
<i>which is why we are having
a pancake cook-off today</i>

12:03.015 --> 12:04.600
<i>right here in the studio.</i>

12:04.767 --> 12:06.811
<i>Now, how are you with a spatula?</i>

12:06.977 --> 12:08.145
<i>You know, can you flip 'em?</i>

12:08.312 --> 12:10.481
<i>- What kind of question is that?
- Well, it's tricky.</i>

13:23.888 --> 13:26.557
<i>And I sure hope no one watching
is named Kevin.</i>

13:26.724 --> 13:27.725
<i>Why is that, Pam?</i>

13:27.892 --> 13:29.143
<i>Well, apparently, there's not one,</i>

13:29.310 --> 13:32.480
<i>but two missing Kevins
in the Melbourne area.</i>

13:32.646 --> 13:35.107
<i>Chief Inspector
Kevin Yarborough's police cruiser</i>

13:35.274 --> 13:37.902
<i>was found abandoned
outside his home in Makara.</i>

13:38.360 --> 13:40.905
<i>Meanwhile, this man, Kevin Garvey,</i>

13:41.071 --> 13:43.115
<i>an American holidaying down under,</i>

13:43.282 --> 13:47.286
<i>was last seen wandering the road
near Kurripa nearly a month ago.</i>

13:47.453 --> 13:49.955
<i>If you have any information
on the whereabouts</i>

13:50.122 --> 13:53.250
<i>of either of these men,
please contact the police.</i>

13:53.709 --> 13:55.461
<i>Right, let's get to those pancakes.</i>

13:55.628 --> 13:56.921
<i>Are you ready, Georgie?</i>

13:57.087 --> 13:58.506
<i>Oh, yes, I am, Pam. Come on over.</i>

14:03.802 --> 14:05.721
<i>Okay, now, tell us about the batter.</i>

14:05.888 --> 14:07.389
<i>Well, we've actually got
three batters, George.</i>

14:07.556 --> 14:09.934
<i>The, uh, the first one
is a plain buttermilk.</i>

14:11.852 --> 14:15.105
<i>That's good.
Yeah, I like the classic pancake myself.</i>

14:15.272 --> 14:16.524
<i>Because you're so boring.</i>

14:16.690 --> 14:18.067
<i>Oh, that's not all true.</i>

14:18.234 --> 14:19.652
<i>Uh, but the second one is banana.</i>

14:19.944 --> 14:21.695
<i>Oh, yum. That's definitely for me.</i>

14:21.862 --> 14:24.114
<i>And the third one, of course,
is a chocolate chip.</i>

14:24.657 --> 14:25.824
<i>Oh, Bruce, you'll have...</i>

14:26.408 --> 14:28.327
Can you hear me?

14:33.123 --> 14:34.124
Fuck.

14:35.668 --> 14:37.711
<i>Good morning. Front desk.</i>

14:37.878 --> 14:40.047
Yeah, I need you to turn my television
back on right now.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.800
<i>Uh, sorry, Mr. Durst. I just reset it.</i>

14:42.967 --> 14:44.009
<i>Just, uh, give it a few minutes.</i>

14:44.176 --> 14:47.096
<i>G'Day Melbourne,</i>
is that show live?

14:47.263 --> 14:49.265
<i>- Sorry?</i>
- Are they shooting it right now?

14:49.431 --> 14:51.850
<i>- Uh, yes, sir. I believe so.</i>
- Where?

14:53.352 --> 14:54.478
Taxi!

15:16.041 --> 15:18.002
Do you know when the bus
is supposed to get here?

15:18.335 --> 15:20.045
Uh, any minute now.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.840
Excuse me, miss.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.300
Are you a mother?

15:25.509 --> 15:27.094
- Yes.
- Thank God.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.346
I have a job interview in that café.

15:29.513 --> 15:32.182
My sitter didn't show up this morning.
If I go in there with a baby,

15:32.349 --> 15:33.976
then they're never gonna hire me.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.561
Could you please watch her?

15:36.186 --> 15:37.855
- Just for five minutes.
- I'm waiting for a bus.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.608
Please. I'll be in and out, I swear.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.153
I really need this job. Please.

15:46.155 --> 15:47.740
- Um...
- I'm begging you.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.038
- Uh, okay. Okay.
- God bless you.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.539
There we go.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.166
Thank you.

16:00.294 --> 16:03.213
Well, you're a good person,
taking a stranger's baby.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.967
She could run off right now.
You'd never see her again.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.054
Desperate times are these.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.557
Just six days left, right?

16:13.849 --> 16:15.017
Here's hoping.

16:15.893 --> 16:16.935
Hey.

16:22.566 --> 16:23.567
Oh.

16:25.903 --> 16:26.945
Oh.

16:27.655 --> 16:28.656
Um...

16:29.239 --> 16:30.824
Excuse me, when's the next bus?

16:31.116 --> 16:33.577
<i>Uh, should be another one
in about 45 minutes.</i>

16:34.078 --> 16:35.537
Um...

16:39.583 --> 16:41.251
Please wait. I'll be right back.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.422
Wait!

16:52.596 --> 16:54.431
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.226
Discrimination is illegal.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.062
Shit.

17:03.649 --> 17:05.359
Wait! Hey!

17:06.110 --> 17:07.236
Stop!

17:08.112 --> 17:09.613
Hey! Stop!

17:46.024 --> 17:47.818
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.365
Let's give it a go. Oh!

17:54.324 --> 17:56.410
Got a man down. Pancake down.

17:56.869 --> 17:59.872
<i>Just when I thought
you were getting the hang of it.</i>

18:00.038 --> 18:01.248
Oh, I'm doing my best here, Pam.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.035
<i>Hey!</i>

18:47.085 --> 18:49.546
Evie! Evie?

18:52.382 --> 18:53.425
What do you want?

18:55.385 --> 18:58.055
- What?
- Just tell me what you fucking want.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.226
Why is this happening again?

19:02.893 --> 19:04.520
'Cause I fucking finished this.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.981
So what do you want?

19:10.901 --> 19:12.236
Did Patti send you?

19:15.072 --> 19:16.615
Who is Patti?

19:19.201 --> 19:21.578
I saw you on my TV.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.082
You were looking right fucking at me.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.834
<i>Everything right?</i>

19:28.001 --> 19:29.086
Yeah.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.213
Yeah. I'm fine.

19:31.922 --> 19:33.257
Is he bothering you, miss?

19:39.471 --> 19:40.639
You can see her?

19:42.057 --> 19:43.517
Would you step back, mate?

19:44.810 --> 19:45.811
You're real?

19:46.603 --> 19:47.604
Do you know him?

19:48.105 --> 19:50.274
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.608
That's bullshit.

19:52.818 --> 19:55.404
I know her. Her name is Evie Murphy.

19:55.863 --> 19:56.947
You know me.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.825
My name is Daniah Moabizzi.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.786
Why are you doing this?

20:03.203 --> 20:05.497
- Step back.
- Hey! Relax.

20:05.664 --> 20:06.790
Do you hear me?

20:06.999 --> 20:08.417
Oi!

20:08.792 --> 20:11.461
Get the fuck off me, asshole. I know her!
I fucking...

20:31.607 --> 20:32.608
<i>Miss Durst.</i>

20:33.650 --> 20:34.651
Yes?

20:50.667 --> 20:52.419
Go on up. They're waiting for you.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.441
- "Take on Me."
<i>- Ja</i>. From?

21:16.193 --> 21:18.946
- A-ha.
- A-ha!

21:24.868 --> 21:26.078
Ms. Durst.

21:26.828 --> 21:29.247
I am so sorry. I did not hear you come in.

21:29.873 --> 21:30.874
I'm Dr. Eden.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.669
And that is Dr. Bekker.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.505
Hi.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.969
<i>Thank you for coming all this way.</i>

21:42.135 --> 21:43.387
We are sorry about the building.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.806
It's a little bit creepy, no?

21:49.184 --> 21:50.227
What'd she say?

21:50.519 --> 21:51.979
Oh, don't worry about her.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.523
Um, let's go downstairs, shall we?

21:56.149 --> 21:57.192
Okay.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.921
This is Bernard.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.340
If you would not mind
removing your clothes,

22:20.507 --> 22:22.676
Bernard will conduct
a brief medical examination.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.094
We have a gown for you.

22:27.848 --> 22:30.475
What kind of medical examination?

22:34.980 --> 22:37.441
It's very routine. It's noninvasive.

22:38.025 --> 22:41.028
And once you're done, Dr. Bekker and I,
we will just ask you a few questions,

22:41.194 --> 22:43.071
and then we can move on to the next step.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.741
If you're a doctor,
why aren't you doing the exam?

22:46.324 --> 22:47.951
Oh, sadly, I'm a physicist.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.747
But Bernard is very professional.
I promise you're in good hands.

22:54.916 --> 22:55.917
Okay.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.712
Great. Well, we will see you in a bit.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.344
<i>She was ready to go.</i>

23:08.346 --> 23:11.975
<i>She was ready to go,
and she wishes she could've told you.</i>

23:14.895 --> 23:17.564
<i>She was ready to go,
and she wishes she could've told you,</i>

23:17.731 --> 23:19.024
<i>but she just couldn't.</i>

23:21.151 --> 23:22.402
<i>It was a stroke.</i>

23:23.236 --> 23:26.156
<i>She was in a coma for three months
before he pulled the plug.</i>

23:26.406 --> 23:29.826
<i>Tell him he set her free.</i>

23:30.827 --> 23:33.663
- Three months is a long time, man.
- Uh-huh.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.250
And she's grateful that you set her free.

23:39.628 --> 23:41.004
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.631
Thank you so much.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.176
My pleasure.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.387
No, but while I'm here,

23:49.846 --> 23:52.891
uh, could you kindly
try to contact my sister now?

23:53.058 --> 23:54.643
- I'll pay extra.
- No, no, no.

23:55.310 --> 23:56.311
That's okay.

23:57.687 --> 23:58.980
Uh, what was her name?

23:59.773 --> 24:01.358
Margery Prentiss.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.450
Uh, there's five Margery Prentisses.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.910
I need a DOB.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.203
<i>What was her birthday?</i>

24:13.870 --> 24:15.622
<i>Uh, March, uh, 17th.</i>

24:22.045 --> 24:24.589
Oh, shit. She's a departure. Abort.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.633
<i>Abort.</i>

24:26.800 --> 24:30.720
Sir, did your sister disappear
on October 14th?

24:32.139 --> 24:34.349
Yes. Why?

24:36.935 --> 24:39.646
I'm so sorry,
but I can't make a connection

24:39.813 --> 24:41.481
with those who departed.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.443
They're in a different space, man.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.365
<i>Wish I could help you out,
but, uh, I can't.</i>

24:52.159 --> 24:53.285
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

24:53.577 --> 24:55.203
Uh, I'm gonna take this.

24:55.704 --> 25:00.000
Um, give him a hug and tell him
the dead wife wants him to move on.

25:01.626 --> 25:02.627
Hey.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.421
<i>Laurie, it's Kevin. Are you alone?</i>

25:05.714 --> 25:07.799
- What?
<i>- Are you alone? Is John with you?</i>

25:08.091 --> 25:10.760
He's downstairs. You okay?

25:11.469 --> 25:13.013
I just saw Evie.

25:15.223 --> 25:18.101
- What?
<i>- Evie. Evangeline Murphy</i>.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.396
She's alive.
She's in fucking Melbourne, Australia.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.691
You're in Australia?

25:25.066 --> 25:28.278
Yes. Uh, Nora had to come here for work.
It doesn't matter.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.157
She's here. She's here.
I talked to her, Laurie.

25:32.657 --> 25:33.700
<i>Okay. Okay, Kevin.</i>

25:33.867 --> 25:35.160
I just... I need you to slow down

25:35.327 --> 25:37.287
and explain to me
exactly what you think you saw.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.289
No, I don't think I saw anything.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.499
I had a fucking conversation with her.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.543
She's here. She's, uh...

25:43.710 --> 25:45.378
I need you to do that thing
that you do on your computer

25:45.545 --> 25:47.797
with the, uh... You know, go on Facebook.
I need you to find her.

25:47.964 --> 25:51.551
She's in Melbourne,
and she's using a, um, a different name.

25:51.927 --> 25:56.640
<i>She's using, um,
Daniah Moabizzi.</i>

25:56.973 --> 25:58.808
<i>Daniah Moabizzi. I...</i>

25:58.975 --> 26:00.143
I took a picture on my phone.

26:00.310 --> 26:02.479
I'm gonna send that to you, okay?
Hang on. Hang on.

26:03.813 --> 26:07.275
Daniah.
Did you see her at the Melbourne Library?

26:07.817 --> 26:09.861
<i>Why? Does she work there?</i>

26:11.863 --> 26:12.906
<i>Did you get the picture?</i>

26:18.536 --> 26:19.746
Yeah, I got it.

26:22.332 --> 26:23.500
It's her.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.669
I know it's her.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.840
Did you talk to Nora about this?

26:31.007 --> 26:32.509
<i>Nora's not here right now.</i>

26:32.759 --> 26:34.886
- Why did you say she was at the library?
<i>- Hey...</i>

26:36.221 --> 26:37.514
Kevin.

26:38.223 --> 26:42.352
Under no circumstances
should you approach Evie again, okay?

26:42.519 --> 26:43.895
<i>It might scare her off.</i>

26:44.062 --> 26:46.564
<i>We just... We need to figure out
what we're gonna do about this, okay?</i>

26:46.731 --> 26:47.857
<i>We need to...</i>

26:50.318 --> 26:51.403
Kevin?

26:52.487 --> 26:53.697
Kevin?

26:56.408 --> 26:58.660
Excuse me. Excuse me!

26:59.202 --> 27:01.037
You know where the public library is?

27:12.215 --> 27:14.217
120 over 80. Optimal.

27:18.972 --> 27:20.557
Almost done.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.268
Just need to draw some blood.

27:24.311 --> 27:25.312
Why?

27:26.229 --> 27:29.065
Anemia, glucose, potassium,
heavy metals, and pregnancy.

27:31.651 --> 27:34.529
Well, I'm definitely not pregnant.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.450
Oh, right. Your IUD.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.076
You'll need to have it removed
before you go through.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.495
- We can refer you to a...
- How did you know I had an IUD?

27:44.205 --> 27:45.540
It's in your medical records.

27:52.047 --> 27:54.341
Just gonna affix some sensors
for an electrocardiogram.

27:54.841 --> 27:55.842
Oh.

27:56.092 --> 27:57.552
Would you mind lowering your gown, please?

28:05.685 --> 28:08.980
The event chamber of the device
requires an intense period of confinement,

28:11.858 --> 28:14.569
so we're gonna simulate that now
while we're monitoring you

28:15.153 --> 28:16.613
just to see how well you hold up.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.587
It'll just be for a few minutes.

28:39.219 --> 28:40.261
There's plenty of air in there.

28:40.428 --> 28:43.139
I am gonna close the lid,
but you can get out at any time.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.855
If you wanna take your money
in the box with you, that's fine.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.691
Some folks worry
that we're gonna run off with it

28:53.858 --> 28:55.026
while they're inside.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.154
No, I trust you.

29:18.842 --> 29:20.176
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

30:09.559 --> 30:10.894
Hi. Hey.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.480
Uh, is Danyah working today?

30:14.272 --> 30:15.273
Who?

30:15.565 --> 30:17.400
Uh... Danyah or Daneeah.

30:17.734 --> 30:19.319
- Daniah?
- Daniah, yes.

30:19.486 --> 30:21.821
I'm not sure. Um, is there something
I can do for you, sir?

30:21.988 --> 30:24.115
Yeah, she was helping me look for a book.

30:24.949 --> 30:25.950
What book was it?

30:26.284 --> 30:27.535
Um... Uh...

30:28.036 --> 30:30.914
<i>Assassins. Assassins,</i> I think.

30:31.164 --> 30:32.874
The title is <i>Assassins?</i>

30:33.041 --> 30:35.627
No. If you call her,
she could probably help me.

30:37.212 --> 30:38.671
We don't have a book by that title.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.590
- I'm sorry.
- No, I know that... I know.

30:40.757 --> 30:43.551
But if you just get a hold of Daniah,
then I think she could help me.

30:43.718 --> 30:46.471
So, if you just do that,
that'd be fucking great, please.

30:53.186 --> 30:54.229
Leonard?

30:56.105 --> 30:57.607
Oh, uh, No. I...

30:58.149 --> 30:59.442
He's being weird.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.361
That so?

31:02.362 --> 31:04.614
No. Um, I just...
I don't, I don't want any trouble.

31:04.781 --> 31:05.949
- I was just...
- Fantastic.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.116
Let's take a walk, mate.

31:07.283 --> 31:08.618
I need to get a book that I was looking...

31:08.785 --> 31:09.869
You're leaving.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.204
<i>It's okay, Leonard.</i>

31:14.290 --> 31:15.583
You know this bloke, Dani?

31:17.585 --> 31:18.628
Yes.

31:19.629 --> 31:20.838
I know him.

31:32.559 --> 31:34.644
Let's talk, Kevin.

31:58.126 --> 31:59.502
I am Evie Murphy.

32:02.839 --> 32:04.882
I have started a new life.

32:06.175 --> 32:09.721
I am asking you not to tell anyone
that you have seen me.

32:10.513 --> 32:14.100
Not my mother, my father, my brother.

32:16.019 --> 32:20.523
I just need you to leave me alone.

32:24.277 --> 32:26.321
John's my friend. He thinks you're dead.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.867
I have started a new life.

32:31.701 --> 32:34.245
You don't have the right
to take that away from me.

32:34.412 --> 32:37.248
Then you need to tell me
why you're doing this.

32:41.336 --> 32:42.503
Because

32:44.047 --> 32:45.840
there is no family.

32:59.437 --> 33:01.731
Then why are you still using that accent?

33:03.274 --> 33:05.818
- I have to go.
- No, no.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.865
What the fuck is going on?

33:42.438 --> 33:43.439
What?

33:45.942 --> 33:50.780
I have compassion for you
because you are ill.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.081
<i>I wanted to help.</i>

34:03.459 --> 34:07.130
She told me to tell you
that I was who you thought I was,

34:08.047 --> 34:09.674
and then you'd go away.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.389
Who told you?

34:18.808 --> 34:20.601
Mmm-mmm. No, no.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.440
This one's on me.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.900
Well, I hope you don't have
any expectations

34:28.067 --> 34:30.486
because you took me out
to dinner, young lady.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.780
I wouldn't dare.

34:36.701 --> 34:37.994
- Who is it?
- Shit.

34:38.911 --> 34:39.996
It's Kevin.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.749
- Call him back.
- I, um...

34:44.500 --> 34:47.378
I think I have to take this.
He's in Australia.

34:47.628 --> 34:48.921
He's where?

34:49.088 --> 34:51.507
Just... Give me, give me a minute.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.018
- Kevin?
- What the fuck did you do?

35:02.185 --> 35:05.146
Okay. I just... I need you to calm down
and just tell me what happened.

35:05.354 --> 35:08.649
What happened is that I went to see Evie,

35:08.816 --> 35:10.902
and she told me
that you fucking called her.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.821
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- The library.

35:14.071 --> 35:15.406
<i>With her? Is she there?</i>

35:17.074 --> 35:18.284
<i>Did you know about this?</i>

35:18.701 --> 35:19.869
<i>Did you know that she was down here?</i>

35:20.036 --> 35:21.871
Okay, Kevin, I need you to listen to me.

35:22.622 --> 35:26.501
I need you
to leave and go back to the hotel, okay?

35:26.793 --> 35:29.462
<i>Go back to Nora, and call me later, okay?</i>

35:29.629 --> 35:31.881
She told me that you said that I was ill.

35:32.715 --> 35:34.217
What the fuck does that mean, Laurie?

35:35.551 --> 35:39.138
Remember when you were seeing Patti,
and I told you that...

35:39.305 --> 35:41.891
<i>I'm not seeing anybody.
She's right fucking here!</i>

35:42.558 --> 35:44.060
You were seeing Patti,

35:44.560 --> 35:47.188
and I told you that you never tell someone

35:47.355 --> 35:48.606
in the midst of a psychotic break

35:48.773 --> 35:50.858
that they are in the midst
of a psychotic break.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.194
Remember?

35:54.070 --> 35:57.031
<i>You need to indulge that person's delusion</i>

35:57.198 --> 35:58.324
<i>and find common ground.</i>

35:58.491 --> 36:01.244
<i>Otherwise, it's very likely
that they will hurt themselves.</i>

36:01.536 --> 36:02.537
I don't...

36:04.038 --> 36:06.249
I don't want you to hurt yourself, Kevin.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.086
<i>Just leave Evie, okay?</i>

36:10.253 --> 36:13.381
Just leave her,
and go back to the hotel, okay?

36:16.300 --> 36:20.221
Or I hang up this phone right now,
and I call John,

36:20.388 --> 36:22.723
and I tell him
that you just spoke to his daughter.

36:34.485 --> 36:37.238
<i>Laurie, you there? Hello?</i>

36:37.947 --> 36:40.324
I need you to pull up
that photo you sent me.

36:41.868 --> 36:44.954
- What?
<i>- The photo that you took of Evie.</i>

36:46.330 --> 36:48.291
I need you to pull it up on your phone.

36:50.084 --> 36:51.961
Can you do that for me, please?

37:01.137 --> 37:02.597
Okay, I did it. What?

37:04.473 --> 37:06.058
I want you to listen to me.

37:06.934 --> 37:10.021
Okay?
I need you to listen to me very carefully.

37:12.607 --> 37:15.610
You could've called anybody
you wanted when this happened,

37:15.776 --> 37:17.194
but you called me.

37:18.821 --> 37:20.990
Because I think you knew
that I could help you.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.952
I'm gonna give you that help now.

37:34.545 --> 37:36.005
This isn't real.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.550
That girl is not Evie.

37:46.182 --> 37:47.767
Look at the photo again.

38:17.129 --> 38:18.589
I'm leaving now.

38:42.738 --> 38:44.740
I don't understand what's happening.

38:48.703 --> 38:51.747
I think that you projected Evie
onto a stranger.

38:52.999 --> 38:55.459
And I think you chose Evie

38:57.628 --> 39:00.631
because you understood
why she did what she did,

39:01.924 --> 39:04.385
why she left her family, why she escaped.

39:05.803 --> 39:08.931
<i>I think a part of you
wants to escape, Kevin.</i>

39:10.266 --> 39:12.018
No, I, I don't want to escape.

39:12.184 --> 39:14.437
<i>Then why are you in Australia?</i>

39:16.105 --> 39:18.232
You are Chief of Police.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.735
You have responsibilities here.

39:21.402 --> 39:24.739
<i>It is less than a week away
from the seventh anniversary,</i>

39:24.905 --> 39:27.825
<i>and you just ran away
without telling anybody.</i>

39:27.992 --> 39:30.995
No, I... I came to be with Nora.

39:32.038 --> 39:34.582
She's the one that needed to be here. I...

39:35.666 --> 39:38.878
And she's the one that, uh, ran away.

39:44.467 --> 39:46.552
Kevin, are you and Nora okay?

39:54.310 --> 39:57.188
Ask John about the fucking book
he wrote about me.

40:18.876 --> 40:20.419
Welcome back.

40:21.837 --> 40:23.172
Your heart is very calm.

40:24.924 --> 40:26.884
- What?
- Your heart rate.

40:28.844 --> 40:31.180
It's very even.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.183
<i>Most people panic after a few minutes.</i>

40:34.517 --> 40:36.352
Oh. Thanks.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.191
Let's have a chat, shall we?

40:43.651 --> 40:44.777
Okay.

40:57.581 --> 41:00.334
Mr. Linn-Baker enjoyed talking to you
in St. Louis.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.128
Where is Mr. Linn-Baker?

41:03.754 --> 41:04.880
He went through.

41:06.549 --> 41:07.716
Through the machine?

41:09.176 --> 41:11.554
- Yes.
- Is it here in this building?

41:15.307 --> 41:16.559
No, it's not here.

41:18.727 --> 41:23.107
I'm happy to answer any other questions
you may have about the device, uh,

41:23.357 --> 41:24.775
technical or otherwise.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.402
Why haven't you used it?

41:27.778 --> 41:29.238
Everything I need is here.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.741
What about you?

41:33.868 --> 41:35.077
I don't like the odds.

41:35.619 --> 41:36.954
Odds?

41:37.705 --> 41:40.583
All we know for certain is
that we are sending people

41:40.749 --> 41:44.920
to the exact same destination
the others went seven years ago.

41:45.171 --> 41:49.633
The odds that this destination
has a sustainable environment

41:49.842 --> 41:53.596
with a breathable atmosphere
and ample food supply are very, very low,

41:53.762 --> 41:58.976
so it is more likely
there are 140 million corpses

41:59.143 --> 42:01.562
floating out there in space somewhere.

42:03.314 --> 42:04.773
You make it sound so appealing.

42:04.982 --> 42:08.611
Actually, um, several of our colleagues
did go through.

42:09.111 --> 42:11.238
Dr. Van Eeghen, the man who...

42:14.825 --> 42:17.620
The man who designed the device,
he was one of the first people to use it.

42:17.786 --> 42:21.290
Oh, yes.
And if you see him, tell him we said hello

42:21.582 --> 42:23.292
and that Finland won the World Cup.

42:32.301 --> 42:33.302
What did she say?

42:40.935 --> 42:42.269
Dr. Bekker is...

42:45.356 --> 42:49.568
Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention
of using the device. Um...

42:50.277 --> 42:51.528
She believes that you're curious,

42:51.695 --> 42:56.158
but once the time comes,
you will get, uh, how do you say,

42:57.034 --> 42:58.118
cold feet.

43:03.832 --> 43:05.501
I won't get cold feet.

43:14.343 --> 43:15.594
Good.

43:17.221 --> 43:18.764
So do you want my money now?

43:19.473 --> 43:21.016
No, not yet.

43:22.393 --> 43:24.061
We have a question for you first.

43:24.853 --> 43:25.896
Just one.

43:26.063 --> 43:27.731
You wanna know
why I brought Kevin with me.

43:29.275 --> 43:30.484
My boyfriend.

43:32.236 --> 43:34.655
You know everything else about me,
so I just figured you'd be worried...

43:34.863 --> 43:36.865
We know who Kevin is,
and we're not worried.

43:38.617 --> 43:40.077
Okay.

43:45.207 --> 43:46.458
What's your question?

43:53.173 --> 43:54.800
Two infant twins are born.

43:55.843 --> 43:57.720
One of them will grow up to cure cancer

43:58.387 --> 44:00.597
but only if the other one dies now.

44:02.057 --> 44:06.061
You don't have to kill the baby yourself,
but you do have to nod to make it happen.

44:08.731 --> 44:09.857
Do you nod?

44:15.821 --> 44:17.781
If I nod, how will the baby be killed?

44:17.948 --> 44:20.075
Will it suffer,
or is it gonna be quick and painless?

44:22.244 --> 44:23.871
Quick and painless.

44:24.496 --> 44:26.081
Are they mine, the twins?

44:26.415 --> 44:27.416
Irrelevant.

44:27.583 --> 44:30.127
It's relevant if you want me to answer
your fucking question.

44:31.837 --> 44:33.088
They're not yours.

44:42.306 --> 44:43.599
She was working for you.

44:45.768 --> 44:47.102
- Sorry?
- The woman at the bus stop

44:47.269 --> 44:49.813
who gave me her baby.
That was a test, right?

44:53.359 --> 44:55.110
We have no idea what you're talking about.

44:55.361 --> 44:57.363
Mmm. Sure, you don't.

44:58.739 --> 45:00.240
Please just answer the question.

45:04.578 --> 45:06.038
Kids die every day.

45:06.538 --> 45:07.998
What's one more?

45:09.458 --> 45:11.460
And I get to cure cancer?

45:12.378 --> 45:13.921
Of course, I nod.

45:24.515 --> 45:25.724
That's it?

45:26.767 --> 45:28.227
Yes, Ms. Durst.

45:28.894 --> 45:30.187
That's it.

45:31.480 --> 45:32.481
So how does this work?

45:32.648 --> 45:34.316
You give me a name. I go to a hotel room,

45:34.483 --> 45:37.152
explain what low-amplitude
Denziger radiation is, and then what?

45:37.319 --> 45:38.654
<i>Do I come back here or what?</i>

45:38.862 --> 45:40.114
That won't be necessary.

45:42.199 --> 45:43.492
What? Why?

45:44.118 --> 45:46.578
I'm afraid we will not be proceeding
any further.

45:47.788 --> 45:49.164
What?

45:49.790 --> 45:52.292
What, did I answer
your stupid question wrong?

45:56.588 --> 46:00.008
Oh... I get it. I get it!

46:00.634 --> 46:03.679
You turn me down, and then you want me
to beg you to take my money, right?

46:05.597 --> 46:06.682
Keep your money.

46:09.184 --> 46:10.352
No.

46:11.019 --> 46:12.187
No.

46:14.690 --> 46:16.024
Wait!

46:19.278 --> 46:20.446
Stop!

46:22.197 --> 46:24.491
Go home, Ms. Durst. This isn't for you.

46:39.631 --> 46:42.926
George. George Brevity.
This is Nora Durst calling for him.

46:43.510 --> 46:45.762
Yeah, I know! I am a fraud investigator,

46:45.929 --> 46:48.599
and I need to talk to him
because I've uncovered a massive fraud.

46:49.349 --> 46:51.018
<i>Hmm. Well, then...</i>

46:51.268 --> 46:53.896
<i>Well, then give me his home number
because it's an emergency.</i>

46:54.104 --> 46:55.397
<i>No, I will not hold...</i>

46:55.981 --> 46:57.399
God damn it!

47:01.570 --> 47:02.738
Hi.

47:03.572 --> 47:04.615
Hi.

47:05.574 --> 47:06.783
What happened to your head?

47:08.535 --> 47:10.287
- Are you smoking?
- Yeah, you want one?

47:11.163 --> 47:13.499
- What happened?
- They turned me down.

47:13.790 --> 47:15.959
- Who?
- The people who invited me here.

47:16.293 --> 47:18.504
They, they told me that
I wouldn't be proceeding any further.

47:18.921 --> 47:20.923
- Did they take your money?
<i>- No</i>.

47:22.049 --> 47:23.425
- I thought it was a scam.
- Yeah!

47:23.592 --> 47:25.636
And they must've known
that I knew it was a scam,

47:25.844 --> 47:27.304
and that's why they fucking ran.

47:28.180 --> 47:29.848
But I'm gonna find them.
I'm gonna find them,

47:30.057 --> 47:31.642
and I'm gonna fucking destroy them.

47:38.524 --> 47:39.650
Are you okay?

47:40.817 --> 47:42.277
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:43.195 --> 47:44.530
Kevin.

47:45.781 --> 47:46.865
What's wrong?

47:50.369 --> 47:51.620
You can tell me anything.

47:55.207 --> 47:56.375
No, I can't.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.127
Why not?

48:00.754 --> 48:02.130
The last time I told you everything,

48:02.297 --> 48:04.967
I woke up handcuffed to a bed,
and you were gone.

48:06.552 --> 48:07.803
Kevin.

48:08.554 --> 48:11.306
I didn't know how to handle
you talking to a dead person.

48:15.435 --> 48:18.397
- Oh, Jesus. Is it happening again?
- I, uh... I...

48:19.481 --> 48:21.483
- We need to call Laurie.
- What?

48:21.692 --> 48:25.779
I told her I would come
back here, and we would call her.

48:27.155 --> 48:28.490
When did you talk to Laurie?

48:28.991 --> 48:30.075
I needed help.

48:30.367 --> 48:32.119
- With what?
- I saw...

48:32.327 --> 48:34.371
- I thought that I saw someone.
- Okay.

48:34.621 --> 48:36.081
- I needed to make sure...
- Who did you see?

48:36.665 --> 48:37.833
That doesn't matter.

48:39.251 --> 48:40.877
You won't tell me, but you'll tell Laurie?

48:41.503 --> 48:43.422
Who else? Matt?
'Cause if you're having visions,

48:43.589 --> 48:44.840
he's gonna wanna put it
in your fucking book.

48:45.007 --> 48:46.883
It's not my fucking book!

48:47.050 --> 48:48.051
No?

48:48.343 --> 48:50.012
I think you like it.

48:50.262 --> 48:52.347
I think you wanna be
Jesus Christ fucking Superstar

48:52.514 --> 48:53.849
because it makes you feel important.

48:54.099 --> 48:56.768
Like it? I fucking love it!

48:57.019 --> 48:58.061
It's riveting!

48:58.687 --> 49:01.189
I've read it fucking cover
to fucking cover!

49:10.198 --> 49:11.783
There you go.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.368
Book's gone.

49:14.703 --> 49:17.039
We never have to talk about it again
because that's what we do.

49:17.205 --> 49:19.499
We don't fucking talk about anything!

49:22.127 --> 49:23.587
What do you wanna talk about?

49:27.883 --> 49:29.384
What do you wanna talk about?

49:37.893 --> 49:39.269
Why didn't you stop me?

49:41.229 --> 49:42.564
Stop you from what?

49:44.524 --> 49:46.234
From giving her away. Lily.

49:47.569 --> 49:48.570
I didn't stop you

49:48.737 --> 49:50.906
because you decided you wanted to do it,
and you did it.

49:51.114 --> 49:52.699
You never even asked me what I wanted.

49:52.949 --> 49:54.993
And if I had, Kevin,
what would you have said?

49:55.702 --> 49:57.412
You were relieved. Just say it!

49:58.288 --> 50:00.832
And now you want a new baby?
Are you fucking insane?

50:01.625 --> 50:04.169
Oh, are you afraid
you're gonna give that one away, too?

50:08.882 --> 50:10.258
<i>You can't have a kid</i>

50:11.677 --> 50:13.428
because then you'd have no excuse.

50:14.763 --> 50:17.933
You couldn't be a victim anymore.
You... You'd have to be okay.

50:18.934 --> 50:20.727
No one would feel sorry for you.

50:25.982 --> 50:28.193
I do not want people to feel sorry for me.

50:28.819 --> 50:30.112
<i>Well, then how long, Nora?</i>

50:31.113 --> 50:32.739
How long before you move past it?

50:36.952 --> 50:38.328
Move past what?

50:40.580 --> 50:42.249
That you lost your kids.

50:43.083 --> 50:44.793
I did not lose them!

50:45.544 --> 50:48.130
My kids are not dead. They are gone.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.798
They are just gone.

50:51.633 --> 50:53.009
Then you should go be with them.

52:20.222 --> 52:21.264
I need a taxi.

52:21.473 --> 52:22.557
<i>No taxis, sir.</i>

52:23.016 --> 52:24.226
Why not?

52:24.684 --> 52:25.977
The explosion.

52:27.354 --> 52:29.064
Yes, hi, uh...

52:33.568 --> 52:35.612
<i>I'll be back.</i>

52:39.699 --> 52:40.784
Jesus.

52:41.284 --> 52:44.746
I can't believe you're actually here.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.123
I saw you on the TV in the window.

52:47.332 --> 52:50.627
I turned to my friend, I said,
"Holy shit! That's my boy."

52:50.836 --> 52:52.587
We called the local hotels,

52:54.506 --> 52:56.383
and here you goddamn are.

52:57.717 --> 52:58.760
Hey, there.

52:59.010 --> 53:00.136
Son, that's Grace.

53:03.932 --> 53:04.975
Is this real?

53:05.267 --> 53:07.018
Of course, it's fucking real.

53:07.185 --> 53:08.520
Where are you going anyway?

53:08.728 --> 53:09.813
Home.

53:10.230 --> 53:11.523
You didn't see the news?

53:11.690 --> 53:13.358
All flights grounded.

53:15.443 --> 53:16.945
Are you alone here?

53:20.115 --> 53:21.157
Yes.

53:22.576 --> 53:24.578
Well, you're not alone anymore.

53:25.620 --> 53:26.872
Come on.
