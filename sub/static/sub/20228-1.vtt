00:32.570 --> 00:36.620
In the far distant future,

00:37.700 --> 00:42.460
when cars are being replaced by hover cars,

00:43.540 --> 00:47.800
there are fools who carry on

00:48.880 --> 00:52.435
racing with a vanishing spirit...

00:52.470 --> 00:56.535
The leading pack has entered the long, long, pass.

00:56.570 --> 01:02.430
In the meantime, relay units have moved to the water stop.

01:03.110 --> 01:05.375
Even after two interplanetary wars,

01:05.410 --> 01:08.410
REDLINE's still popular amongst the public.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.910
Instead of the mainstream anti-gravity engine—

01:11.945 --> 01:13.135
Papa!

01:13.170 --> 01:15.115
My money's on Sonoshee.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.975
You really like her, huh?

01:17.010 --> 01:18.800
I put mine on Deguon.

01:18.835 --> 01:19.700
You're kidding!

01:20.460 --> 01:21.430
I can't.

01:21.465 --> 01:22.365
You stink!

01:22.400 --> 01:24.145
You can squeeze in!

01:24.180 --> 01:27.960
—2358 teams entered. The preceding Blue Line has—

01:28.240 --> 01:29.540
Who did you bet on?

01:29.575 --> 01:31.157
JP.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.705
No way!

01:32.740 --> 01:34.305
Pa! Where were you?

01:34.340 --> 01:36.975
With 6 teams having already made it,

01:37.010 --> 01:40.140
the battle for the last spot is raging here at Yellow Line.

01:40.175 --> 01:44.105
Papa! This way! Hurry!

01:44.140 --> 01:47.585
The venue for the REDLINE is still under wraps.

01:47.620 --> 01:50.490
The fans are curious to see the result of the viewers' request.

01:50.525 --> 01:53.840
Once the winner of Yellow Line is settled,

01:53.875 --> 01:55.270
REDLINE's venue will be announced.

01:55.305 --> 01:56.670
Get around to the right.

01:56.705 --> 01:57.359
Roger.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.870
Our own relay unit Portal has just arrived at the final relay point.

02:00.905 --> 02:03.377
Papa! A Portal is here!

02:03.412 --> 02:05.815
It's a Portal! Look!

02:05.850 --> 02:10.320
Now, let's get back to the race and see who's in the lead.

02:24.850 --> 02:27.850
Pa! Get the camera, quick!

02:29.330 --> 02:32.730
It's upside down, Papa!

02:36.490 --> 02:40.240
Papa! The lens cap's on!

02:54.310 --> 02:56.940
Did you see that?! Awesome!

03:08.980 --> 03:13.140
Only 50 klicks left in the Planet Dorothy Yellow Line.

03:13.175 --> 03:15.445
Against everyone's expectations,

03:15.480 --> 03:19.680
"Cherry Boy Hunter" Sonoshee McLaren's hover jet is still in the lead.

03:19.715 --> 03:23.490
She's heading straight for the finish line in Crab Sonoshee.

03:24.290 --> 03:31.000
The very first REDLINE champion, Captain-2-Block's Captain the Classic is in second.

03:31.035 --> 03:33.295
Followed by the REDLINE regulars,

03:33.330 --> 03:35.985
Count Markdie and Spark, in their Snake Head.

03:36.020 --> 03:38.640
Coming up fourth ls Lynchman's archenemy,

03:38.675 --> 03:41.900
Psychoman & Lotten's Psycho Rod.

03:42.010 --> 03:43.835
With these four leading the race,

03:43.870 --> 03:47.675
the second group is coming up fourteen seconds behind them.

03:47.710 --> 03:52.380
From planet Supergrass ruled by the Princess with magical powers

03:52.415 --> 03:54.205
Deguon's Fire Bird is leading the group.

03:54.240 --> 03:59.060
Right behind her is Planet Dorothy's own Bons Missile-EP4.

03:59.095 --> 04:04.230
Sweet JP's Transam is seventh at the very end.

04:04.265 --> 04:07.547
The other racers are left way behind.

04:07.582 --> 04:11.326
Looks like it's down to these seven.

04:11.361 --> 04:15.070
Though l have my doubts about JP.

04:15.105 --> 04:16.670
Doubts, you say?

04:17.310 --> 04:21.720
Just trying to make things interesting here.

04:22.210 --> 04:26.720
What do you announcers know about racing?!

04:44.630 --> 04:47.940
JP's uncorked the nitro on the final stretch!

04:47.975 --> 04:49.175
He's making a break for it!

04:49.210 --> 04:52.830
He broke away from the second group on a rocket boost!

04:53.240 --> 04:56.810
Crab Sonoshee is still holding the lead.

04:57.280 --> 05:01.840
Look out! JP's Transam has caught up!

05:18.540 --> 05:19.730
Take this!

05:28.680 --> 05:31.580
Look at JP's splendid move!

05:32.980 --> 05:34.545
The heat is on!

05:34.580 --> 05:37.080
The crowd must be going wild.

05:38.790 --> 05:42.550
Captain the Classic is challenging Crab Sonoshee.

05:55.410 --> 05:56.160
That punk!

06:13.320 --> 06:17.730
He held back till the last quarter like you said.

06:18.190 --> 06:22.475
He's the odds on favorite near the finish.

06:22.510 --> 06:26.760
Everything's hunky-dory, huh, Frisbee?

06:27.240 --> 06:32.040
JP's the only one who can pull off a fixed game like this.

06:32.380 --> 06:35.270
None of these guys can beat him at the Yellow Line.

06:35.550 --> 06:37.560
That's what you say.

06:38.560 --> 06:43.650
You don't think JP would try to win this, do you?

06:43.685 --> 06:45.115
Not a chance.

06:45.150 --> 06:49.825
But if he wins, he qualifies for REDLINE.

06:49.860 --> 06:54.490
You don't think he may just decide to go for it?

06:54.525 --> 06:58.360
That won't happen. I can guarantee it.

07:16.850 --> 07:19.620
You're starting to get annoying, Cherry Boy Hunter!

07:32.840 --> 07:37.870
Crab Sonoshee's hover jet takes a chance by diving into the river.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.870
You're not getting away!

08:05.900 --> 08:08.940
I'll send you all to hell!

08:43.559 --> 08:44.770
Here we go!

09:06.760 --> 09:11.405
You know, Frisbee, if JP wins,

09:11.440 --> 09:15.935
the syndicate's gonna take a big hit.

09:15.970 --> 09:20.045
Look. He isn't called "Sweet JP" for nothing.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.980
Besides, he wouldn't risk getting thrown back in the joint.

09:26.710 --> 09:32.960
"Sweet JP", huh? I hope you're right.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.225
Bids are locked.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.760
And our position on JP?

09:36.795 --> 09:38.960
All unloaded.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.065
Good.

09:40.100 --> 09:46.750
Now we'll see how your friendship with JP plays out.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.770
Hold it, hold it...

10:04.805 --> 10:05.730
Now!

10:40.120 --> 10:45.680
Overtaking Crab Sonoshee, JP finally takes the lead!

10:45.715 --> 10:47.625
Nobody can catch him now.

10:47.660 --> 10:51.190
He's charging toward the finish line on a nitro burst.

11:57.130 --> 11:57.920
Yes!

13:10.340 --> 13:13.600
You amateurs are shitty racers!

13:13.635 --> 13:15.600
You guys suck!

13:18.710 --> 13:19.650
Let's go.

14:05.290 --> 14:07.090
Thank you!

14:07.760 --> 14:12.430
Sonoshee McLaren won the Planet Dorothy Yellow Line.

14:12.465 --> 14:14.792
A new racing queen is born!

14:14.827 --> 14:17.120
The ticket to REDLINE is hers.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.605
Listen to the crowd!

14:19.640 --> 14:23.900
This completes the lineup of racers for REDLINE.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.480
The venue for the big race will be announced shortly.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
Look.

15:11.930 --> 15:13.335
What?

15:13.370 --> 15:15.120
You first.

15:15.155 --> 15:17.012
No, you go.

15:17.047 --> 15:18.673
After you.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.300
After you.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.380
That Transam must have cost a fortune.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.390
You couldn't possibly put together a machine like that.

15:40.890 --> 15:43.170
You knew exactly what you were getting into.

15:43.205 --> 15:45.450
You're off the hook with your bondsman now.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.900
That should cover your hospital bill and more.

15:48.935 --> 15:51.130
I'd say it's a win-win.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.160
Racers and mechanics gotta stick together.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.830
You and I make a good team. Always have.

15:59.940 --> 16:02.840
Call me when you wanna get in the game again.

16:03.650 --> 16:06.380
We can make tons of money as a team, you know.

16:09.670 --> 16:12.090
Hey, watch out! You crazy?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.975
I changed my mind. It's all yours.

16:16.010 --> 16:18.860
What's this? Principles got the better of you?

16:18.895 --> 16:20.225
Your bondsman won't like it.

16:20.260 --> 16:23.270
So I go back in. Probably better off.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.840
What the heck is that?

16:26.875 --> 16:27.630
Wait, wait!

16:29.310 --> 16:32.275
JP! How do you feel about going to REDLINE?

16:32.310 --> 16:35.240
Sweet JP! How about a big smile for our camera?

16:35.510 --> 16:36.875
Don't get me in it!

16:36.910 --> 16:41.780
Are you really going for the race? Will you drop out?

16:43.520 --> 16:47.210
What are you talking about? I just blew the Yellow Line.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.210
What, you didn't know?

16:49.245 --> 16:50.060
Huh?

16:51.390 --> 16:55.625
Since
KURUKURU=DAZA and SHOTO=O-JIN declined,

16:55.660 --> 16:59.195
the team of Miki & Todoroki - the winners of the Blue Line -

16:59.230 --> 17:04.720
and JP, who had a brilliant run at the Yellow Line, were nominated.

17:04.755 --> 17:06.175
The hell?!

17:06.210 --> 17:08.839
They just announced the next REDLINE's venue.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.810
It'll be at Roboworld!

17:10.845 --> 17:12.204
Roboworld?!

17:12.240 --> 17:14.069
You shitting me?!

17:15.050 --> 17:18.180
Beloved people of the M3 nebula!

17:19.010 --> 17:22.750
I shall crush the REDLINE race that dares to enter our sector.

17:23.130 --> 17:28.464
Shame on those criminals for disturbing our galaxy's order!

17:28.500 --> 17:33.070
Roboworld is a symbol of humanity that exists for peace.

17:33.105 --> 17:37.605
I can never allow REDLINE to enter this sacred place!

17:37.640 --> 17:42.670
We will destroy any outsiders who enter our territory by any means necessary!

17:42.705 --> 17:44.345
See? No chance.

17:44.380 --> 17:47.120
The next REDLINE's gonna be held at Roboworld...

17:47.155 --> 17:49.402
It was confirmed just a few minutes ago.

17:49.437 --> 17:51.650
I can't believe they're allowing this.

17:51.685 --> 17:53.650
That's just it. They're not.

17:53.685 --> 17:54.525
Thought so.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.990
That's why KURUKURU=DAZA and SHOTO=O-JIN dropped out.

17:59.025 --> 18:02.625
I was gonna do it for fun, you know?

18:02.660 --> 18:07.300
There's no way I'm gonna race while dodging bullets.

18:07.335 --> 18:08.790
That's true.

18:09.270 --> 18:13.730
I'm a racer now, not a soldier. I've had enough of that shit.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.615
Not me.

18:16.650 --> 18:19.820
Roboworld is an important client of my kingdom.

18:19.855 --> 18:22.600
I'm not ready to give up my life just yet.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.100
So after a popularity poll, two teams were picked.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.190
I see...

18:37.170 --> 18:39.475
Are you going...

18:39.510 --> 18:41.280
Or will you drop out?

18:41.670 --> 18:43.730
JP, please make a statement!

18:43.765 --> 18:45.837
I take it back, Frisbee.

18:45.872 --> 18:47.910
Fix the Transam, will you?

18:47.945 --> 18:48.875
What?!

18:48.910 --> 18:51.115
So you're going, then?

18:51.150 --> 18:52.960
He won't.
Is that official, JP?

18:53.420 --> 18:57.360
Think twice before you say something.

18:57.395 --> 18:58.415
Give me the camera.

18:58.450 --> 19:01.225
Please give us a comment, JP!

19:01.260 --> 19:03.580
Watch out, Roboworld! Here comes JP!

19:05.560 --> 19:09.830
That's the comment from JP, who has qualified for REDLINE.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.300
Oh goody! It's time for the festival of fools again!

19:14.335 --> 19:16.460
I like rough sports every now and then.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.970
Parole
Parole

19:27.270 --> 19:27.319
Europass

19:27.320 --> 19:33.190
The ship is approaching
Roboworld's satellite, Europass.

19:33.225 --> 19:37.230
Please prepare for landing in the designated pod.

19:37.730 --> 19:42.860
The ship is approaching
Roboworld's satellite, Europass.

19:43.570 --> 19:47.500
Please prepare for landing in the designated pod.

19:56.350 --> 19:59.115
Wow! It's picking up speed.

19:59.150 --> 20:02.410
Where's the switch for the flaps?

20:06.660 --> 20:09.660
Is this a coffin or what?!

20:09.960 --> 20:15.660
This is a blatant act of aggression!

20:16.130 --> 20:17.870
Secretary Titan!

20:17.905 --> 20:18.604
Sir!

20:18.630 --> 20:21.225
You must have something to report!

20:21.260 --> 20:23.935
I just received a message from our scout vessels.

20:23.970 --> 20:29.270
They have detected an unidentified group of ships on Europass's surface.

20:29.305 --> 20:30.810
Europass?

20:30.845 --> 20:31.545
Yes.

20:31.580 --> 20:35.020
Oh, the planet we donated to those pathetic refugees.

20:35.680 --> 20:42.610
It's demilitarized under our treaty with the M3 Nebula Federation.

20:43.030 --> 20:45.030
That means our forces must tread very carefully there.

20:45.330 --> 20:49.790
Besides, refugees from nearby sectors have drifted in

20:49.825 --> 20:52.255
and set up slums all over the place.

20:52.290 --> 20:56.530
It's an ideal hideout for REDLINE racers.

20:57.170 --> 21:00.230
This is what we get for being so generous!

21:02.180 --> 21:06.420
They have the audacity to claim it as being the viewers' request.

21:06.455 --> 21:11.037
Don't they know we can't put our military secrets at risk?

21:11.072 --> 21:15.620
We cannot allow a foolish race in such a sacred place!

21:15.655 --> 21:17.320
Mr. President.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.020
Are you all right, sir?

21:25.630 --> 21:27.640
Mr. President!

21:27.675 --> 21:28.374
What?

21:28.400 --> 21:31.660
You're not going to stand by and let them pass, are you?

21:31.695 --> 21:33.815
I am the law!

21:33.850 --> 21:38.475
All those affiliated are guilty and deserve to be hanged!

21:38.510 --> 21:43.240
As the president, I'll take full responsibility, because I am justice.

21:43.790 --> 21:48.560
The entire universe is in need of strong leadership,

21:48.595 --> 21:53.330
and Roboworld's heroic authority is what it craves!

21:54.100 --> 21:56.850
Colonel Volton!

21:57.800 --> 22:00.470
Are you ready to shed your blood for justice?

22:00.505 --> 22:02.205
More than ready, sir!

22:02.240 --> 22:06.610
Excellent! Place your life on the line for it!

22:07.710 --> 22:09.440
Thank you, sir!

22:16.870 --> 22:17.910
Hey, you!

22:18.950 --> 22:20.025
Hey, I'm talking to you!

22:20.060 --> 22:23.390
Don't you ignore me! Buy the ticket, will ya?

22:24.050 --> 22:25.095
Don't ignore me!

22:25.130 --> 22:27.560
You have money, don't you?

22:29.300 --> 22:32.200
How about I give you a discount?

22:32.800 --> 22:35.070
What happened here?

22:36.240 --> 22:37.740
Get off me.

22:37.775 --> 22:39.205
What happened?

22:39.240 --> 22:42.650
Stop it! Sorry to disappoint, but I'm not here to watch.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.570
Useless! You're so fucking useless!

22:45.605 --> 22:47.242
Ah, fuck.

22:47.277 --> 22:48.880
Wait!

22:49.620 --> 22:53.910
One, two, three, four...

22:57.580 --> 22:59.080
Next!

22:59.960 --> 23:01.265
ls this it?

23:01.300 --> 23:03.730
You're sure about the exchange rate?

23:03.765 --> 23:05.480
It's just about right. Next!

23:06.030 --> 23:08.320
Just about? What the hell?

23:08.670 --> 23:10.360
You need to take money more seriously...

23:10.395 --> 23:11.570
You're annoying!

23:21.680 --> 23:22.710
Right here.

23:23.690 --> 23:24.955
What?

23:24.990 --> 23:26.360
I need some smokes.

23:26.395 --> 23:27.190
Got money?

23:27.860 --> 23:30.790
Sure. I just cashed in.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.180
Give me as many as this will get.

23:39.840 --> 23:40.960
Here.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.540
Huh? That's it?

23:43.575 --> 23:45.210
It's already open.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.605
This ain't right.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.015
Money needs to be taken—

23:51.050 --> 23:53.980
Don't like it? Then leave it!

23:54.015 --> 23:56.910
Just leave it and walk away!

24:03.060 --> 24:03.900
Huh?

24:11.470 --> 24:12.169
Woops.

24:16.510 --> 24:17.400
Dude!

24:21.040 --> 24:23.420
Looks clear!

24:24.280 --> 24:27.320
Good. Let's roll!

24:33.530 --> 24:35.075
Nice!

24:35.110 --> 24:37.760
This anti-gravity engine's not bad!

24:37.795 --> 24:40.390
Yeah...not bad at all!

25:00.980 --> 25:01.930
Done.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.020
Oh, it's you.

25:08.390 --> 25:10.590
This planet is really something, huh?

25:10.625 --> 25:11.955
What did you expect?

25:11.990 --> 25:15.610
This place gets flotsam from all over the galaxy.

25:15.645 --> 25:19.230
It's hard for the idea of good service to sink in.

25:19.265 --> 25:21.040
How are you holding up?

25:22.870 --> 25:23.840
Fine, I guess...

25:24.560 --> 25:25.305
Ouch!

25:25.340 --> 25:27.210
Yeah, I can see that.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.870
I got the case from Frisbee. Stuffed with cash.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.870
It's for the Transam.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.860
He used to drop everything to work on your machine.

25:45.895 --> 25:48.065
He sure has changed.

25:48.100 --> 25:50.735
Like you, me and everything else.

25:50.770 --> 25:54.630
Cigs cost more and good junk joints are harder to find.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.640
So where's my wheels?

26:14.520 --> 26:17.725
You really did it this time, ingrate.

26:17.760 --> 26:21.230
What were you thinking using the nitro twice?

26:21.265 --> 26:23.700
You have a death wish?

26:24.170 --> 26:26.560
l need three caps for the REDLINE.

26:27.390 --> 26:28.545
Three!

26:28.580 --> 26:30.775
Hey, watch it!

26:30.810 --> 26:33.805
I'm going up against the best.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.765
I'm gonna need an edge, aren't I?

26:36.800 --> 26:41.640
You want an edge? Then get your machine loaded up.

26:41.675 --> 26:43.640
You know that anything goes at REDLINE.

26:43.675 --> 26:46.047
l can get you armed up good.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.385
This is a race, not a war.

26:48.420 --> 26:51.125
I don't want any of this crap on my machine.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.830
That's right, I forgot. You're "Sweet JP."

26:53.865 --> 26:55.095
Don't call me that!

26:55.130 --> 26:59.900
The red rules say you can do whatever the hell you want.

26:59.935 --> 27:04.270
Playing fair isn't going to cut it.

27:04.305 --> 27:06.000
It isn't, huh?

27:07.750 --> 27:13.110
30 years in this business and I've still got it.

27:14.120 --> 27:18.690
I clean up good with all the trades I get at the race.

27:18.725 --> 27:24.250
A little fun on the side wouldn't hurt, either.

27:26.130 --> 27:27.640
Listen, JP.

27:28.630 --> 27:33.965
If you want a rig that'll stand up to three caps of juice, you're talking a total redesign.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.300
If you don't want to deal with that, all I can do is to get you a new engine and parts.

27:39.335 --> 27:41.440
I wish I could do more.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.145
Hey, you listening?

27:45.180 --> 27:47.370
Frisbee can handle the redesign and tune-up.

27:47.405 --> 27:48.750
You're joking!

27:48.785 --> 27:49.750
Why?

27:51.620 --> 27:53.720
When was the last time you two worked as a team?

27:53.755 --> 27:54.625
Stop it.

27:54.660 --> 27:56.445
Frisbee's not legit anymore.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.250
I said stop it!
He's sold out. He's no good!

28:06.370 --> 28:07.640
Talking about the fix?

28:08.400 --> 28:11.820
He's not the same man. You know that, right?

28:11.855 --> 28:15.205
Helping an ingrate like you is no big deal,

28:15.240 --> 28:18.450
but getting mixed up with that scum is another story.

28:18.485 --> 28:21.130
Racers and mechanics gotta stick together.

28:21.650 --> 28:25.410
You and I make a good team. Always have.

28:26.050 --> 28:27.875
Hey, Frisbee. I was wondering when you'd show.

28:27.910 --> 28:32.590
I may be scum, but l still got the touch, you know.

28:32.625 --> 28:34.920
Don't judge a man's skill by his character.

28:35.630 --> 28:39.570
So you've learned to sneak around, too, Frisbee?

28:41.970 --> 28:43.335
Relax, old man.

28:43.370 --> 28:46.350
If I didn't have the touch, I wouldn't still be here.

28:47.510 --> 28:50.350
Nobody's worried about your skill.

28:52.350 --> 28:54.340
The old man's on board.

28:54.375 --> 28:56.330
I didn't agree to anything.

28:56.365 --> 28:58.315
Hey, quit that!

28:58.350 --> 29:00.460
I guess I'll leave it to the two of you now.

29:00.495 --> 29:01.880
Hey! Where are you going?

29:04.590 --> 29:07.025
The old man will get a new engine.

29:07.060 --> 29:10.235
Frisbee takes care of the redesign and mods.

29:10.270 --> 29:13.630
I'll do my job when I put my butt behind the wheel.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.730
Until then, I'll leave everything to you pros.

29:17.470 --> 29:19.520
Just like the old days.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.900
He think he's cool or something?

29:39.890 --> 29:41.120
What do you want?

29:42.830 --> 29:44.460
This ain't your seat, punk!

29:45.030 --> 29:46.630
You want some?!

29:47.800 --> 29:51.500
Oh, a comb... Don't make me jump, you fool!

29:51.870 --> 29:55.080
I see you have a full house today, waiter.

29:55.115 --> 29:56.675
I'm the manager, you jerk!

29:56.710 --> 29:58.880
And enough with the wisecracks! The place's deserted.

29:58.915 --> 30:02.010
Just pick a table and settle down, will ya?

30:02.045 --> 30:02.940
Sure, whatever.

30:03.420 --> 30:05.580
Sorry about that, ma'am.

30:06.550 --> 30:10.550
He won't bother you anymore, so don't worry.

30:11.230 --> 30:14.730
Here's your soup spaghetti a la Europass lobster.

30:14.765 --> 30:16.030
Wow, it looks great!

30:16.065 --> 30:17.547
Bon appetit!

30:17.582 --> 30:19.030
Thank you.

30:27.710 --> 30:29.575
Watch what you're wearing!

30:29.610 --> 30:31.440
Oh no! How embarrassing!

30:31.880 --> 30:33.080
What are you doing?

30:33.115 --> 30:33.985
Nothing.

30:34.020 --> 30:35.910
No, seriously.

30:36.550 --> 30:39.120
Excuse me. I'm JP.

30:39.155 --> 30:40.385
JP?

30:40.420 --> 30:41.760
Are you gonna eat that?

30:41.795 --> 30:43.050
Huh?

30:43.790 --> 30:45.050
What's this?

30:49.830 --> 30:51.030
Give me a break...

30:51.470 --> 30:54.060
Mind if I join you?

30:55.070 --> 30:56.560
I'm waiting for someone.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.560
Bummer.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.170
You're that guy from the Yellow Line.

31:03.205 --> 31:04.155
I remember now!

31:04.190 --> 31:06.710
You're going to REDLINE as a substitute, right?

31:06.745 --> 31:07.570
What do you want?

31:09.050 --> 31:13.050
I thought I'd check you out since you're going, too.

31:13.085 --> 31:13.990
Come again?

31:15.990 --> 31:17.225
She saw my underpants...

31:17.260 --> 31:20.665
Winning the Yellow Line with a hover engine...

31:20.700 --> 31:23.970
That's so sweet that I wanted to see what the deal was.

31:24.005 --> 31:25.330
And the verdict?

31:26.330 --> 31:28.630
Verdict? Well...

31:29.000 --> 31:33.370
I see an engine nut with no interest in men.

31:33.405 --> 31:34.275
Bingo!

31:34.310 --> 31:38.675
Wheels are my only love. Racing's all I've ever known.

31:38.710 --> 31:43.040
So you're one of those depressing types with no friends.

31:43.650 --> 31:46.150
Why don't you get lost?

31:51.730 --> 31:53.630
My Dad was a racer.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.095
We owned a junk joint.

31:56.130 --> 31:59.080
We used to build our own machines to enter races.

31:59.630 --> 32:01.330
Oh?

32:02.340 --> 32:05.530
It was the most natural thing to do...

32:06.110 --> 32:07.130
What's that?

32:08.380 --> 32:11.840
Steamlight. Isn't it pretty?

32:12.450 --> 32:15.850
My Dad gave it to me on my seventh birthday.

32:17.850 --> 32:21.225
So this is a steamlight, huh? I've never seen one before.

32:21.260 --> 32:27.630
They say when burned as fuel, it releases 100 times more energy than gold nitro.

32:27.665 --> 32:29.055
No kidding.

32:29.090 --> 32:32.610
It's my first time seeing it, too.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.170
An energy source with unlimited capacity...

32:36.100 --> 32:40.560
No man can handle that amount of power, though.

32:40.940 --> 32:43.345
You know a lot, don't you?

32:43.380 --> 32:45.750
Oh, pardon me. I'm Shinkai.

32:45.785 --> 32:46.870
Pleased to meet you.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.790
Aren't you gonna eat that hexagonal worm spaghetti?

32:50.825 --> 32:51.980
It's very good.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.160
You can have it, if you want.

32:54.195 --> 32:55.180
Oh goody!

32:56.290 --> 32:59.060
May I perhaps have you tonight, as well?

33:02.300 --> 33:03.530
Yummy time!

33:04.430 --> 33:07.500
She would have been mine if you hadn't interrupted.

33:07.535 --> 33:09.460
Mr. Substitute.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.670
You could just call me a reserve.

33:12.910 --> 33:16.680
You guys are racers, right? I saw you on the news.

33:16.715 --> 33:18.675
I'm a racer myself, you know.

33:18.710 --> 33:22.000
Though I must say I'm more known as a mechanic.

33:22.350 --> 33:25.990
I have a partner named Trava.

33:26.025 --> 33:27.250
Trava?

33:28.750 --> 33:30.220
Let me go!

33:32.610 --> 33:35.610
Stop trashing the place! Take it outside!

33:36.130 --> 33:37.140
Trava!

33:37.500 --> 33:38.455
Your partner?

33:38.490 --> 33:40.640
The one who's beaten up, yes.

33:40.675 --> 33:41.830
Which one's beaten up?

33:43.500 --> 33:45.470
What the hell did you do that for?

33:45.840 --> 33:47.995
You started it.

33:48.030 --> 33:50.115
Shit! Here he goes!

33:50.150 --> 33:52.400
It's your fault, damn it.

33:52.435 --> 33:54.812
You betrayed the army.

33:54.847 --> 33:56.918
Is the tough guy crying?

33:56.953 --> 33:58.955
That's Little Deyzuna.

33:58.990 --> 34:02.150
He used to be in the army with us.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.220
He becomes impossibly strong when he cries.

34:14.590 --> 34:17.005
Having a race in Roboworld!

34:17.040 --> 34:20.100
You're just doing that to make me suffer!

34:21.510 --> 34:22.875
That's bullshit!

34:22.909 --> 34:25.100
It's nothing personal and you know it!

34:25.135 --> 34:26.370
Liar!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.830
Here comes more trouble.

34:49.239 --> 34:52.969
Well, if it ain't Machine Head Tetsuzin himself.

34:53.005 --> 34:54.739
For real?

34:54.775 --> 34:56.335
Yep.

34:56.370 --> 34:58.840
He's Mr. REDLINE. The fastest man in the galaxy.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.600
Outta my way.

35:05.450 --> 35:07.275
What did you say?

35:07.310 --> 35:09.065
I said, outta my way!

35:09.100 --> 35:12.590
You think you can order me around?

35:12.625 --> 35:14.612
I'm just telling you to move.

35:14.647 --> 35:16.565
That's an order, you moron!

35:16.600 --> 35:19.840
Fine. I'll just go around you then.

35:24.540 --> 35:27.910
That's what you get when you mess with me!

35:27.945 --> 35:29.440
The hell with the race!

35:47.430 --> 35:48.160
Sonoshee!

35:51.130 --> 35:51.829
This way!

36:16.890 --> 36:17.625
What?

36:17.660 --> 36:19.590
Roboworld forces.

36:32.470 --> 36:35.580
You're a hard man to find.

36:36.210 --> 36:37.730
Co-Colonel Volton!

36:38.910 --> 36:42.220
No one gave you an order to leave the base!

36:42.520 --> 36:45.540
I told you to stay put, didn't I?

36:45.890 --> 36:47.910
Look what you did!

36:54.130 --> 36:59.760
Too bad you had to come all the way here to save his sorry ass.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.330
Stay there!

37:02.800 --> 37:07.380
This is a demilitarized zone. We won't stand for this.

37:07.415 --> 37:08.427
So what?

37:08.462 --> 37:09.405
Huh?

37:09.440 --> 37:10.945
I said, so what?

37:10.980 --> 37:15.330
Are you hard of hearing or something?

37:17.190 --> 37:19.915
Oh, I can hear you fine.

37:19.950 --> 37:22.790
I just don't need your permission.

37:22.825 --> 37:25.595
Doesn't matter. I got what I came for.

37:25.630 --> 37:30.030
I have my orders to use force on the day of the race.

37:30.065 --> 37:31.235
Jesus...

37:31.270 --> 37:34.000
The meanest troops in the galaxy!

37:42.210 --> 37:48.120
Our President has generously offered to show up at your silly race.

37:48.155 --> 37:53.050
You should try to be good targets in return.

37:53.085 --> 37:56.190
I suppose having your heads can wait.

37:56.225 --> 37:57.020
Hey, you!

37:57.660 --> 38:00.560
Don't try something stupid.

38:06.500 --> 38:10.870
You're blocking the ventilation.

38:11.640 --> 38:12.830
Beat it.

38:14.380 --> 38:18.310
You've got seven guns pointed at you.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.320
That'll solve my...

38:26.490 --> 38:27.450
Ouch.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.105
Aw!

38:42.140 --> 38:43.655
That hurts...

38:43.690 --> 38:45.170
How's your head?

38:45.970 --> 38:47.570
I'll live.

38:48.650 --> 38:50.045
What were you thinking?

38:50.080 --> 38:54.870
Those bastards were really trying my patience.

38:54.905 --> 38:56.340
Couldn't help it.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.380
They screwed up your plan, too.

39:00.660 --> 39:02.285
I guess you're right.

39:02.320 --> 39:07.460
Thanks for this. You really are sweet, aren't you?

39:07.495 --> 39:10.192
It's a stupid nickname for the fans,

39:10.227 --> 39:12.890
"Cherry Boy Hunter" Sonoshee McLaren.

39:12.925 --> 39:14.532
Cherry Boy? What's that?

39:14.567 --> 39:16.105
Haven't you read the paper?

39:16.140 --> 39:19.440
That nickname of yours made quite the headline.

39:19.475 --> 39:20.672
That's stupid!

39:20.707 --> 39:21.870
Don't look at me.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.500
What did you do that for?

39:28.620 --> 39:30.335
Why the sour face?

39:30.370 --> 39:32.050
Cherry Boy Hunter...

39:33.090 --> 39:34.510
Can I ask you something?

39:34.545 --> 39:36.100
What?

39:36.690 --> 39:40.220
Why do you do it?

39:41.200 --> 39:42.595
What about you?

39:42.630 --> 39:45.445
Me? Not much to tell.

39:45.480 --> 39:48.260
Then don't ask me.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.260
Sorry.

39:54.310 --> 39:56.940
C'mon! Out with it!

39:56.975 --> 39:58.735
I mean...

39:58.770 --> 40:00.900
It's really no big deal.

40:02.050 --> 40:02.980
Really.

40:07.720 --> 40:08.980
I see.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.720
Suit yourself.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.540
You need more muscles if you wanna take those bastards.

40:18.575 --> 40:20.670
Good night now.

40:20.705 --> 40:21.600
Night.

40:32.340 --> 40:34.280
Hey, you dropped this!

40:41.360 --> 40:42.910
Oh, well.

40:43.260 --> 40:45.080
Go faster! Go!

40:45.930 --> 40:48.090
All right! Go for it!

40:50.500 --> 40:51.950
That was a close one!

40:51.985 --> 40:53.340
Is she okay?

41:00.610 --> 41:03.630
You did great! You drive like the wind!

41:03.940 --> 41:06.850
You gave all you have. Just forget about it.

41:06.885 --> 41:09.880
I'm gonna race in the REDLINE someday!

41:09.915 --> 41:10.780
What?

41:12.590 --> 41:15.825
I've busted my ass for it everyday.

41:15.860 --> 41:19.390
I can't afford to waste my time like this!

41:20.760 --> 41:25.320
I'm not like you amateurs who're all talk.

41:27.230 --> 41:31.690
Why don't you quit watching and get out here on the track with the rest of us?

41:49.980 --> 41:52.020
Wow...

41:58.230 --> 42:01.080
I bet she doesn't remember.

42:07.170 --> 42:08.200
JP!

42:10.680 --> 42:14.980
I'm telling you, I can't work with this jerk.

42:15.015 --> 42:15.745
Why?

42:15.780 --> 42:18.790
Your pal here says he doesn't like the engine I got.

42:18.825 --> 42:20.660
You sure about him?

42:20.695 --> 42:22.125
It's REDLINE!

42:22.160 --> 42:26.140
We need something bigger. A <i>lot</i> bigger.

42:26.175 --> 42:28.710
We're talking about the race here!

42:28.745 --> 42:30.795
A man is driving!

42:30.830 --> 42:35.170
This guy's talking about a goddamn TRZ Airmaster!

42:35.205 --> 42:35.995
Seriously?!

42:36.030 --> 42:37.005
Go ahead, laugh!

42:37.040 --> 42:40.440
It's a crapshoot! Sure it's got power, but it's unstable as hell.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.205
A four-cycle TRZ Airmaster!

42:42.240 --> 42:46.270
All it needs is a dose of Frisbee magic.

42:46.305 --> 42:47.270
Like hell it does!

42:47.980 --> 42:50.315
Besides, JP's driving it.

42:50.350 --> 42:53.020
You think he doesn't have what it takes?

42:53.055 --> 42:56.780
You're the one I'm not sure about.

42:57.190 --> 42:58.525
Who the hell do you think you are?

42:58.560 --> 43:01.730
Showing up with all that money, then you start ordering me around!

43:01.765 --> 43:03.490
Just get him what he wants.

43:03.860 --> 43:05.535
Not you too!

43:05.570 --> 43:06.535
Get him what he needs.

43:06.570 --> 43:08.135
You're getting yourself killed.

43:08.170 --> 43:11.910
As far as the design goes, Frisbee's in charge.

43:11.945 --> 43:13.175
We're a team, right?

43:13.210 --> 43:16.375
Ha! That's all in the past.

43:16.410 --> 43:19.965
You know how long it'll take to get one of those monsters?

43:20.000 --> 43:23.520
It's your job to get what we need in time for the race.

43:23.555 --> 43:26.060
You're in charge of getting us the engine.

43:26.095 --> 43:28.060
Some things just can't be done.

43:28.490 --> 43:31.050
Old man... please.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.220
Let me race in his machine.

43:34.600 --> 43:39.030
Fine, you fool... It's gonna cost you double though.

43:39.065 --> 43:41.260
Thanks, old man. I owe you one.

43:44.870 --> 43:49.080
Two days away

43:55.450 --> 43:57.280
Pretty fast.

43:58.690 --> 44:00.685
Not as many as I expected.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.910
The ones with money don't come here.

44:02.945 --> 44:05.100
They like using the private tracks.

44:06.100 --> 44:10.920
I get it. This is the place for broke racers.

44:13.800 --> 44:17.670
Don't worry. Looks like the engine will make it in time.

44:18.140 --> 44:20.360
He'll get it. He always comes through.

44:21.240 --> 44:22.670
That's our old man.

44:25.250 --> 44:28.010
I talked to Inuki, by the way.

44:28.580 --> 44:31.585
Same drill as last time.

44:31.620 --> 44:35.380
Stay in the last till the third quarter to get your odds down.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.330
Then make your move in the last quarter.

44:38.365 --> 44:39.190
Frisbee.

44:40.160 --> 44:43.690
Once I'm behind the wheel, I'm the boss, right?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.990
I'd rather find another way to pay for the engine.

44:50.070 --> 44:53.110
You can get a spare engine, but not a spare life.

44:53.145 --> 44:55.520
You really have no choice.

45:01.650 --> 45:03.285
We're all in this together.

45:03.320 --> 45:06.220
That includes falling hot sparks and chip crumbs.

45:07.640 --> 45:11.160
An underground mine

45:15.860 --> 45:17.665
That's it for today!

45:17.700 --> 45:19.980
Let's go place our REDLINE bets.

45:20.015 --> 45:20.714
Yeah!

45:21.380 --> 45:22.365
An underground casino

45:22.400 --> 45:26.870
Buy No.4. It's a sure thing. It's the current favorite.

45:26.905 --> 45:28.210
Give me 100 on No.4.

45:28.245 --> 45:29.175
How about you?

45:29.210 --> 45:31.845
I'll take 150 on Gori Rider.

45:31.880 --> 45:34.050
You sure? He always comes in fifth.

45:34.085 --> 45:35.152
It won't hurt.

45:35.187 --> 45:36.185
50 on No.2 please.

45:36.220 --> 45:38.120
Don't be stingy. Bet hard!

45:38.155 --> 45:38.955
50's good.

45:38.990 --> 45:40.785
I'll take 300 on JP.

45:40.820 --> 45:43.530
You're betting on a long shot, huh?

45:43.565 --> 45:45.590
The odds'll be 25,000 to 1.

45:46.190 --> 45:47.160
I know.

45:47.730 --> 45:49.165
What the hell? What's this?!

45:49.200 --> 45:52.040
Break up this gathering immediately!

45:52.570 --> 45:53.435
Shut up!

45:53.470 --> 45:54.425
Give me money!

45:54.460 --> 45:57.500
This is a violation of law.

46:08.520 --> 46:11.140
Next up is today's segment featuring Crab Sonoshee.

46:11.950 --> 46:18.490
The new engine can dodge missiles by minimizing the heat source.

46:18.525 --> 46:23.100
On an infrared camera, you can see it's much smaller.

46:23.135 --> 46:25.730
Now the missiles' heat sensor...

46:25.765 --> 46:27.490
My butt's on camera!

46:29.400 --> 46:35.120
Looks like Crab Sonoshee's gearing up for the big race.

46:35.610 --> 46:37.235
The man of sonic speed.

46:37.270 --> 46:40.095
Since his first win at the fourth REDLINE,

46:40.130 --> 46:45.385
this invincible king's been at the top for 20 years.

46:45.420 --> 46:51.140
The machine linked racer who keeps altering himself along with his machine "God Wing."

46:51.175 --> 46:53.870
The irrefutable champion of REDLINE!

46:58.040 --> 47:03.150
The king of kings, Mr. REDLINE: Machine Head Tetsuzin!

47:03.570 --> 47:06.770
Good evening all. I'm Machine Head Tetsuzin.

47:06.805 --> 47:10.405
Well, for me... how shall I put it?

47:10.440 --> 47:15.160
I'd say I'm in a different league compared to the others.

47:15.480 --> 47:18.635
'Cause in my case, I'm a part of my machine.

47:18.670 --> 47:21.755
For the others, it's "Me and my wheels."

47:21.790 --> 47:25.330
But in my case, It's "I am my wheels," you see?

47:25.365 --> 47:27.055
He can't underestimate his rivals, though.

47:27.090 --> 47:30.625
The royal family's Boiboi and Bosbos make their return,

47:30.660 --> 47:35.180
with Princess Supergrass, the last heir to magical superpowers.

47:35.410 --> 47:38.910
This time around, they've sealed off their magic.

47:42.880 --> 47:46.155
The carefree beauty pair - Super Boins.

47:46.190 --> 47:51.325
Hi there! I'm a super sexy and gorgeous racer, Boiboi.

47:51.360 --> 47:56.460
I don't know about that, but oh well... I'm Bosbos.

47:56.495 --> 47:59.710
We are Super Boins!

48:01.600 --> 48:03.625
Wanna see my schtick?

48:03.660 --> 48:05.520
I can make all kinds of faces.

48:07.630 --> 48:08.440
See?

48:11.110 --> 48:13.725
How about it? Impressive, huh?

48:13.760 --> 48:16.340
I can make funny faces, too.

48:17.540 --> 48:19.330
So cute!

48:20.380 --> 48:21.870
Now you're creeping me out.

48:22.720 --> 48:24.615
So? What do you say?

48:24.650 --> 48:27.750
Princess! We are going to win for sure!

48:30.220 --> 48:33.690
Planet Supergrass's racing, singing, super idol group.

48:33.725 --> 48:38.150
Here's their new single, "Zooming Gears"!

48:42.900 --> 48:45.240
And how can we forget this amazing pair?

48:46.140 --> 48:47.735
Heel hero of Alsatia.

48:47.770 --> 48:49.705
The strongest, fastest bounty hunters!

48:49.740 --> 48:53.550
The Mad Brothers - Lynchman and Johnny Boya!

48:54.880 --> 48:57.580
We're Lynchman and Johnny Boya, the bounty hunters.

48:58.220 --> 48:59.330
Don't tell me you haven't heard of us!

48:59.390 --> 49:01.770
We've never failed to catch our targets,

49:01.805 --> 49:03.555
'cause we're so fast.

49:03.590 --> 49:06.515
That bastard Machine Head has beaten us in the past,

49:06.550 --> 49:09.405
but with a new machine, it's gonna be different.

49:09.440 --> 49:13.470
You'll see. I'll repay my debt from the last time in double.

49:13.505 --> 49:14.380
Don't wet your pants, suckers!

49:21.780 --> 49:26.250
Lynchman's Best Fight Series No.7 is now on sale!

49:29.120 --> 49:30.230
What the hell?

49:31.010 --> 49:32.990
Eve

49:33.025 --> 49:34.970
Eve

49:36.690 --> 49:38.315
Looking good.

49:38.350 --> 49:40.095
A test car for training.

49:40.130 --> 49:43.260
I installed an old TRZ Airmaster engine.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.820
No kidding!

49:45.400 --> 49:47.390
You should be able to get a feel for it with this.

49:47.770 --> 49:48.920
Can I?

49:48.955 --> 49:50.070
All yours.

49:51.810 --> 49:53.015
This is great!

49:53.050 --> 49:54.220
This'll do.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.330
That's Sonoshee!

50:16.340 --> 50:17.125
Hey, everyone!

50:17.160 --> 50:19.675
After his dramatic crash in the Yellow Line,

50:19.710 --> 50:22.190
JP's done it again during his latest test run.

50:22.570 --> 50:27.530
Crashing at 300 km per hour, he was miraculously unhurt.

50:29.580 --> 50:32.040
A showdown between rivals.

50:33.650 --> 50:37.840
The day before the Yellow Line that Miki and Todoroki were qualified to race in,

50:37.875 --> 50:40.990
a police vehicle relentlessly chased their speeding car.

50:43.360 --> 50:46.190
It made a bull-charge at the Blue Line champs,

50:46.225 --> 50:49.880
who made it to REDLINE on reserve.

50:53.800 --> 50:58.220
Dirty policeman Hamesh Frini aka "Gori Rider"!

50:58.255 --> 51:02.605
The tape shows that you've overdone it this time.

51:02.640 --> 51:08.620
I'll bust them cocky racers who dare to challenge me by any means necessary.

51:08.655 --> 51:09.354
You got that?!

51:09.380 --> 51:12.015
Could you explain something, Gori Rider?

51:12.050 --> 51:16.820
A police officer that's supposed to be a moral example committing adultery?

51:16.855 --> 51:19.890
Care to comment on your affair with Ms. Yang-Sue?

51:19.925 --> 51:21.240
Shut up!

51:21.560 --> 51:25.870
A vengeful wild pair from the shining blue planet,

51:25.905 --> 51:27.750
Miki and Todoroki!

51:28.170 --> 51:34.170
Charismatic racers who turn any road into a circuit swear revenge in the REDLINE.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.880
Gori Rider! Motherfuckers!

51:46.890 --> 51:48.660
It's finally here, JP!

51:48.750 --> 51:51.965
Can't get any better than this baby.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.090
An 80 mm thick cylinder block good for 35,000 horsepower.

51:56.125 --> 51:57.730
It's the last Airmaster.

51:59.090 --> 52:00.975
It's not a dream.

52:01.010 --> 52:02.860
We finally got it...

52:03.670 --> 52:06.940
Of course! Who the hell do you think I am?

52:12.010 --> 52:14.980
It's a great engine with extraordinary power.

52:15.450 --> 52:18.110
It's up to you now, Frisbee.

52:18.520 --> 52:21.050
I'll have this in the Transam by morning.

52:21.960 --> 52:25.030
With a beefed up stove, it's good for three loads.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.725
Relax, old man.

52:29.760 --> 52:33.320
I'm putting my reputation at stake here.

52:38.470 --> 52:42.310
Must be a pre-race party going on at Roboworld.

52:42.345 --> 52:43.905
A goddess may see those.

52:43.940 --> 52:46.110
What're you up to at this hour?

52:46.145 --> 52:46.940
Gotta go.

52:47.280 --> 52:50.120
Where the hell is he going?

52:50.620 --> 52:53.390
The big race is tomorrow.

52:53.425 --> 52:54.510
No idea.

52:58.790 --> 53:00.590
My job's done here.

53:11.350 --> 53:14.235
An underground transmission station

53:14.270 --> 53:17.180
The walls are 800 mm thick cosmo titanium.

53:17.215 --> 53:18.510
Fire the shock-breaker!

53:25.020 --> 53:25.805
Fuck it up!

53:25.840 --> 53:27.715
Damn Robopolice!

53:27.750 --> 53:30.310
Trespassers detected.

53:30.345 --> 53:32.870
Stand down immediately.

53:33.160 --> 53:35.860
You've got no business here! Get lost!

53:35.895 --> 53:37.890
Hostile intent detected.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.870
Cease your resistance and surrender.

53:40.905 --> 53:42.190
Over my dead body!

53:45.310 --> 53:47.240
Shoot the runner!

53:48.440 --> 53:49.970
You bastard!

53:51.380 --> 53:52.200
Stay the hell down!

54:05.230 --> 54:06.470
What is it?

54:06.990 --> 54:12.400
Coolie hires have attacked our main power station,

54:12.435 --> 54:14.495
so we've switched to auxiliary power.

54:14.530 --> 54:19.510
Large-scale weapons are disabled until power is restored.

54:19.545 --> 54:20.630
Damn them!

54:21.240 --> 54:24.110
Rest assured, Mr. President.

54:25.050 --> 54:29.390
We have a secret weapon ready for anyone entering our atmosphere.

54:29.850 --> 54:34.485
A giant A.I. we've been developing over the years.

54:34.520 --> 54:39.120
Solar system integrated satellite weapon unit...

54:40.560 --> 54:43.220
The hyper-disintegrator cannon!

54:43.730 --> 54:44.900
Please take a look.

54:55.510 --> 54:57.330
Hey, Lynchman.

54:57.365 --> 54:58.175
What?

54:58.210 --> 55:01.670
Why did the Racing Commission put us up to this?

55:01.950 --> 55:05.030
If the hyper-disintegrator was to blast everything to hell,

55:05.065 --> 55:08.190
there wouldn't be any race. That means no betting.

55:08.225 --> 55:09.210
I see.

55:09.720 --> 55:10.660
Get in.

55:12.810 --> 55:15.385
That wouldn't be good for the fat cats.

55:15.420 --> 55:17.960
You know how much money is riding on this?

55:17.995 --> 55:19.335
No idea.

55:19.370 --> 55:21.770
Enough to buy out a couple of planets.

55:21.805 --> 55:22.735
Wow!

55:22.770 --> 55:26.775
Besides, it'll be great publicity for them.

55:26.810 --> 55:31.810
REDLINE's odds'll go up, and so will their margins.

55:31.845 --> 55:32.850
Makes sense.

55:34.450 --> 55:36.620
So this is our target for today?

55:36.655 --> 55:38.680
Sure is!

55:45.290 --> 55:49.300
The main power station's system was attacked

55:49.660 --> 55:53.530
by pro-REDLINE guerrillas consisting of coolie hires.

55:58.560 --> 56:03.910
As a result, the RED-RACERS are kept safe from anti-air strikes.

56:03.945 --> 56:07.210
Roboworld officials are currently conducting repairs.

56:07.510 --> 56:09.225
According to government sources,

56:09.260 --> 56:13.510
the power station's system malfunctioned late last night.

56:13.545 --> 56:14.870
When Robopolice arrived—

56:45.190 --> 56:46.040
Your name?

56:48.320 --> 56:49.019
JP?

56:49.820 --> 56:50.454
Where did you get that?

56:50.455 --> 56:51.170
Weird name.

56:52.070 --> 56:52.769
I'm Sonoshee.

56:52.800 --> 56:53.499
Sonoshee.

57:16.420 --> 57:18.955
With REDLINE just a day away,

57:18.990 --> 57:23.910
we should keep our eyes on the racers trying to enter Roboworld.

57:23.945 --> 57:28.830
For this non-stop road race on the military's exercise grounds,

57:28.865 --> 57:31.780
each driver's chosen course will be the key.

57:32.430 --> 57:36.740
We've been profiling the REDLINE racers every evening.

57:36.775 --> 57:39.675
On the eve of the big race, we feature JP,

57:39.710 --> 57:43.300
who only made the cut because another racer dropped out.

57:43.680 --> 57:47.450
Like Lynchman who's notorious for his violent conduct,

57:47.485 --> 57:49.280
JP has a dark past of his own.

57:49.720 --> 57:53.420
According to our research,

57:53.455 --> 57:57.085
this man nicknamed "Sweet JP"

57:57.120 --> 58:02.150
was indeed a race-fixing specialist in the past.

58:02.630 --> 58:03.560
No way!

58:05.300 --> 58:09.060
The Racing Commission should seriously reconsider its—

58:15.110 --> 58:17.740
Lucky me. Nothing's busted.

58:21.250 --> 58:23.580
The final day

58:31.150 --> 58:33.125
What was that?

58:33.160 --> 58:36.545
I think it's the Supergrass's scout vessel.

58:36.580 --> 58:39.895
The army of that wicked wizard princess, huh?

58:39.930 --> 58:43.160
So they've teamed up with the REDLINE now, have they?

58:43.330 --> 58:46.510
Keep going, keep going...

58:46.545 --> 58:48.310
A bit more...

58:48.345 --> 58:49.485
Stop!

58:49.520 --> 58:54.010
Too bad you have to race without a test run.

58:54.045 --> 58:55.810
I'll be fine.

58:56.450 --> 58:57.195
JP.

58:57.230 --> 58:57.940
Yeah?

58:58.350 --> 58:59.510
You know the drill, right?

58:59.990 --> 59:02.550
What I know is that it's my show now.

59:17.130 --> 59:19.610
What's that red smoke?

59:39.060 --> 59:40.090
Ta-dah!

59:40.600 --> 59:41.840
Nice work, Princess.

59:41.875 --> 59:43.045
That's a piece of cake.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.280
<b>Planet Supergrass Grass Hall</b>
Planet Supergrass Grass Hall

59:44.315 --> 59:46.752
Now, all we can do is to wait.

59:46.787 --> 59:49.190
We're going there to win, okay?

59:49.930 --> 59:54.700
I have just received information that Supergrass's Red Angels

59:54.735 --> 59:59.470
have successfully marked the finish line by the Roboworld Tower.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:01.720
That's our princess!

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.720
I guess she made it.

01:00:03.755 --> 01:00:04.935
Of course.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:08.480
She's the only one who can use remote magic.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.480
We have to make her proud.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:15.620
Morning, Sonoshee!

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:18.800
Looks like you're mad at me.

01:00:18.835 --> 01:00:20.315
Not really.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.705
We're rivals now anyway.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.740
Once we're on the race track, friendship doesn't mean anything.

01:00:24.775 --> 01:00:26.270
I guess you're right.

01:00:26.305 --> 01:00:27.240
Uh huh.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.345
Sonoshee.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.040
The ship will enter the drop zone in three minutes.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.630
Good luck, then.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.750
You see the transport ship?

01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:42.860
Yes, Mr. President.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.125
Let's say the line marked by our HQ is the finish line.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.705
800 km west above the expected start line: the Knockout Tower.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:56.250
We detected an energy reading from a hyperdimensional drive.

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:58.130
Hyperdimensional drive?

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:06.230
How dare they violate our airspace using navigation that's supposed to be theoretical!

01:01:06.265 --> 01:01:09.580
I'll teach those RED-RACERS a lesson!

01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:13.960
Titan! Arm the hyper-disintegrator cannons!

01:01:13.995 --> 01:01:15.310
Yes, sir!

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.835
Bought your ticket yet?

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.880
Hey! You put everything on Sonoshee.

01:01:36.915 --> 01:01:38.850
Yeah, Sonoshee's my girl.

01:01:38.885 --> 01:01:40.145
You're the man!

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.150
Give me those pork buns!

01:01:41.185 --> 01:01:42.167
Only three left.

01:01:42.202 --> 01:01:43.150
That's fine.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.045
Hey, you! You betting or not?

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.050
Not yet. I'm waiting for the final odds.

01:01:48.085 --> 01:01:48.985
Hot!

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.540
What a mess! You're supposed to eat it in one bite.

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:55.325
Okay guys, it's the last call!

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.595
Anyone who wants to buy in, step up now.

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.830
One minute to the start! I'm closing now!

01:01:59.865 --> 01:02:01.015
Give me JP!

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.510
One minute until we reach the target point.

01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:05.970
All racers, please prepare for the drop.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.530
Hyper-disintegrator cannons arming.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:47.780
95% energy level. Initiate firing sequence.

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:51.530
Please put on your light shield, sir.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.050
We're entering the drop zone.

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:02.530
We have an energy reading from the transport ship.

01:03:02.565 --> 01:03:04.190
It's exiting hyperdimensional space.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.760
Get it on the monitor.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.700
Open fire on visual contact.

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.450
Aye-aye, sir.

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:26.790
Fire the cannons!

01:03:26.825 --> 01:03:27.700
Firing!

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:39.810
What's wrong? Why aren't they firing?

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.365
We have a malfunction.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.690
What?! That's unacceptable!

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.180
Good morning, all you lucky fans gathered here today.

01:04:28.215 --> 01:04:31.740
Five long years of waiting is finally over!

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:34.550
The machines have been dropped from the sky to start the race!

01:04:34.585 --> 01:04:36.957
They're heading straight toward the Knockout Tower.

01:04:36.992 --> 01:04:39.330
If you're looking for a long shot, he's your man!

01:04:39.365 --> 01:04:41.655
JP with his trademark ducktail.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.830
His odds are a whopping 25,000 to 1!

01:04:44.865 --> 01:04:47.435
What's up with that hair?

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.335
But his machine's just as impressive.

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:51.770
You see every kind of design imaginable in this race,

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.722
but I don't think anyone's ever modified a car like JP.

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.640
That sure is unique. I have to love his dedication.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.470
Dedication? Maybe. Or maybe his hair is screwing with his brain.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.755
I'm your announcer, the rattle-king Void Do.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:09.660
Our other commentator is the former REDLINE champ, Mr. Minerva Hanness.

01:05:09.695 --> 01:05:11.095
Stay tuned!

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:12.825
Damn RED-RACERS!

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.630
Mr. President, let my troops take over from here.

01:05:16.665 --> 01:05:18.820
All right. Give them hell!

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.670
All you brave soldiers.

01:05:21.705 --> 01:05:23.100
Our time has come!

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:26.770
They'll approach from three directions.

01:05:26.805 --> 01:05:29.970
Split into 3 groups to counter them!

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.550
Volton troops, move out!

01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:34.870
Roger!

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.710
I'm hit! I'm going down!

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.220
Here comes God Wing followed by Busties!

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.380
Speed Master and Semimaru are right behind.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.335
God Wing made a splash landing.

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.930
He's immediately going for a counterattack!

01:07:02.965 --> 01:07:05.310
What will you do now, Super Boins?

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:07.405
Holy cow! They're blazing away!

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.920
You won't stand a chance unless you make a swift landing.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.530
Lynchman's chasing after Sonoshee. Will he catch up?

01:07:14.565 --> 01:07:17.620
Johnny! Shoot the sidewinder into Crab Sonoshee.

01:07:17.655 --> 01:07:18.450
Okay!

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:36.900
Damn, I'm burning! Those jerks!

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.470
What the hell?!

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:48.020
Huh?

01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:56.210
Take this, you fools!

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.140
Hot!

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.380
No way!

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:21.575
Oh no!

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:25.520
Not bad, Colonel Volton.

01:08:25.555 --> 01:08:27.620
Thank you, sir.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.279
What?

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:36.560
I see.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.380
Sir, I've just been informed. We have another problem.

01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:43.265
What now?

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:47.075
It's the broadcast ratings.

01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:52.595
82% of broadcast satellites in the M3 Nebula are now

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:59.420
beaming live coverage of the REDLINE to the entire galaxy.

01:08:59.455 --> 01:09:00.580
In other words,

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.885
every secret military asset and facility on Roboworld—

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:10.950
Smash those racers before they reach Zone XXXXXXX, where Funky Boy is sleeping.

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:13.635
Funky Boy must not be awakened.

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.680
He's still a baby fresh from the womb.

01:09:16.715 --> 01:09:19.689
He needs more time to learn to listen...

01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:26.529
Payback time!

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:38.979
Suckers!

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.770
Good job, No.3 engine!

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:54.935
Get a hold of this!

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.900
Crab Sonoshee's charging up the slope.

01:09:58.210 --> 01:09:59.475
Bold move!

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.365
She may be able to take the shortcut,

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.910
but Lynchcar and Transam have to go around.

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.260
Johnny! l see the dam!

01:10:07.295 --> 01:10:08.160
Here we go!

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.800
I see you, Lynchman!

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.740
You finally caught up, huh? I thought you retired.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.270
You wish!

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:33.640
I'll show you!

01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:48.550
Yes! Now we're even!

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.350
You wanna play, Sonoshee? I'm game!

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:56.080
Trava...

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.080
Regret leaving me behind in the army?

01:11:05.115 --> 01:11:05.840
Captain Deyzuna!

01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:06.575
What?

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.480
We've spotted a moving target 5 km west of here.

01:11:08.515 --> 01:11:10.950
Looks like a RED-RACER.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.220
Okay. All vehicles, move to the target!

01:11:14.255 --> 01:11:15.375
Roger.

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.440
This one's mine. I'm gonna rip his head off!

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:23.745
That weasel! He thinks he can beat me?

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:28.770
I've been waiting for this a long time, Trava!

01:11:28.805 --> 01:11:31.495
What the hell do you want?

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:34.080
My sand-bike's gonna whip your sorry ass!

01:11:34.115 --> 01:11:36.630
In your dreams, you pathetic little shit!

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.520
Come get me!

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.185
Now let's check out what JP's up to.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.550
He's finally approaching the dam way behind the others.

01:11:47.585 --> 01:11:50.290
I think it's time for JP to retire.

01:11:50.325 --> 01:11:51.055
Yeah, really.

01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:55.420
Everything's out of balance! Friggin' Frisbee...

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:58.365
What's wrong, JP?

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.770
Get her up to speed and you're in the clear.

01:12:00.805 --> 01:12:02.997
Don't be afraid to use the gold nitro.

01:12:03.032 --> 01:12:05.190
Never thought I'd need this so soon.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.470
Go!

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.150
He's skimming across! Did you see that?

01:12:22.185 --> 01:12:23.190
I don't believe it!

01:12:23.225 --> 01:12:24.325
He made it!

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.860
You gotta give it to him. That was impressive.

01:12:27.895 --> 01:12:29.900
He's still way behind the rest, though.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.930
You're late, Frisbee.

01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:39.900
How's your friend doing so far?

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:45.440
JP's still in last like we planned, so his odds will stay low.

01:12:45.475 --> 01:12:48.580
He'll make his move in the last quarter,

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:50.907
get his odds up, then he loses.

01:12:50.942 --> 01:12:53.165
Same as the last time. No problem.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.590
I'm still worried that he may wanna win the race.

01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:01.430
That will cost me a great deal, you know.

01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:03.290
There's no guarantee, is there?

01:13:03.325 --> 01:13:05.025
You can relax.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:08.550
There won't be any surprises.

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.090
No!

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.930
Stop picking on us!

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:19.640
Oh no!

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.760
I've had it!

01:13:24.795 --> 01:13:26.400
Let's roll!

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:39.700
Hi!

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.710
Coochy-coochy-coo.

01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:59.585
What's going on, Big Deyzuna?!

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:02.270
Two planes were shot down before I knew it.

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:04.920
So you lost a couple of planes. No big deal.

01:14:04.955 --> 01:14:06.690
Use your head!

01:14:06.725 --> 01:14:07.399
Sir!

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:13.610
Dr. Sabose! Quit playing around with those pervs and their tits!

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.440
Wipe out the racers in the southern sector already!

01:14:16.475 --> 01:14:17.089
Sir!

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:22.140
Little Deyzuna! Who told you you could break formation?

01:14:22.175 --> 01:14:24.080
Sorry, sir! I'll do my best.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.370
Get back in formation and force them into Zone XXXXXXX!

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.885
Are you listening to me?

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.255
Colonel Volton, please!

01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:37.910
Don't let this punk make a fool of me!

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:42.960
Stop raving and get a hold of yourself!

01:14:42.995 --> 01:14:44.995
I repeat,

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:47.900
get back in formation and chase them to Zone XXXXXXX!

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.865
That is an order!

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:52.740
I'm afraid I can't obey that order, sir.

01:14:52.775 --> 01:14:54.592
I'm entering the race.

01:14:54.627 --> 01:14:56.375
Have you lost your mind?

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.585
You'll be court-martialed and executed!

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:03.870
Colonel... I know the risk, but I have to do this.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.015
I guarantee victory!

01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:09.095
No! I can't allow that! Deyz...

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:12.130
Colonel Volton! Will you just stand by and watch?

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:14.960
What do you think?

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:18.360
Attention, all soldiers of Roboworld!

01:15:18.395 --> 01:15:19.895
Attack with everything we have!

01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:22.890
Intercept the racers in Zone XXXXXXX!

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:26.855
Everything, Colonel?

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:30.900
You heard me! EVERYTHING!

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:36.580
All racers are converging at the minefield in Zone XXXXXXX.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:38.750
God Wing is in the lead in the northern sector,

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:39.915
followed by Super Boins.

01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:42.290
From the southern sector, Crab Sonoshee's coming on strong!

01:15:42.325 --> 01:15:45.080
Trava's Speed Master's coming from the central sector,

01:15:45.115 --> 01:15:48.080
with Little Deyzuna right on his tail.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.400
Speed Master's faster than those mines' detonators!

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.735
We have new footage.

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.105
Gori Rider is burrowing underground.

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.430
The Miki/Todoroki team is right behind him.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:10.120
It may be a shortcut, but who knows if its faster?

01:16:10.155 --> 01:16:13.440
Ouch! You think we've cleared XXXXXXX by now?

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:17.200
Probably. Let's get out of here and take them down!

01:16:17.235 --> 01:16:17.934
All right!

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.830
Let's do this, Miki!

01:16:24.865 --> 01:16:26.330
Go get them!

01:16:26.365 --> 01:16:28.250
Guts!

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:30.650
You sure about waking it up?

01:16:30.685 --> 01:16:32.035
(Zone XXXXXXX) Underground

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:36.380
Yeah. The bioweapon sleeping in the most heavily protected area,

01:16:36.415 --> 01:16:38.045
"Funky Boy."

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.300
We have to use him to fight Volton's troops.

01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:46.335
Guts!

01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:48.140
Guts!

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:50.660
Let's go!

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:54.445
Guts!

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.500
Miki and Todoroki are making their move.

01:16:57.535 --> 01:16:59.705
They took the lead!

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:02.770
Yes, Miki! We're in the lead!

01:17:02.805 --> 01:17:03.590
Land mine!

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.050
Looks like JP's made it to Zone XXXXXXX somehow.

01:17:14.085 --> 01:17:16.400
What do you mean "somehow"?

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.550
Frisbee.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.690
You do know this is business?

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:28.560
Of course I do.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.290
What?!

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.805
Look, it's a carrier!

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.410
I see they decided to send the Air-Destroyer.

01:17:45.445 --> 01:17:46.300
Uh-oh!

01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:49.060
Colonel Volton's getting serious.

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:08.030
He kicked me!

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.190
I have to end this!

01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:17.465
Lynchman!

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.440
Johnny, come close to me.

01:18:19.475 --> 01:18:20.190
Okay!

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:23.820
Time to use the thunderbolt!

01:18:23.855 --> 01:18:25.130
Rotate 120 degrees!

01:18:25.165 --> 01:18:26.660
On it!

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.850
Shit, I missed!

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:36.420
We did it!

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.190
Launch flares!

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.600
That should teach them a lesson.

01:18:51.635 --> 01:18:54.275
Those racers are as good as dead.

01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:57.120
There's no need for any further attack.

01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:00.985
Mr. President, did you think I'd stop now?

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.150
You can't afford to take pity on scum like them.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.380
Very well, then.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.015
Damn, I can't break them.

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.220
Yes, you can! Just trust yourself!

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:39.460
What's this place?

01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:07.450
I'll get you out of there, Sonoshee.

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:25.205
That's a bioweapon.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.005
Isn't it violating the peace treaty?

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.450
I have a feeling we're not supposed to be seeing this.

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.490
How is this possible?

01:20:49.525 --> 01:20:50.590
This is a nightmare.

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:56.430
Mr. President, we can't let Funky Boy destroy Roboworld.

01:20:56.465 --> 01:21:03.110
It will be considered a breach of the peace treaty.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:06.565
We must take measures immediately.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.250
You must make a decision, sir!

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:11.910
Mr. President!

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:16.285
We have the hyper-disintegrator cannons back on line.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.620
They'll be ready to fire as soon as charging completes.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.630
Hail the President!

01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:31.630
Target Funky Boy. He's out of control!

01:21:31.665 --> 01:21:33.010
Yes, sir.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.020
Target's set. We're ready to fire.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.260
Take him down in one shot!

01:21:46.295 --> 01:21:49.000
Okay, give the command.

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.370
Fire the cannons!

01:21:56.405 --> 01:21:57.260
Firing!

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:26.730
Princess!

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.960
Excellent! We've wiped them out.

01:22:31.995 --> 01:22:34.300
Energy discharge complete.

01:22:34.335 --> 01:22:36.240
We're recharging.

01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:39.105
This can't be happening.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.740
Are they really dead?

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:42.775
I don't believe this.

01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:46.240
They actually used the hyper-disintegrator cannon.

01:22:46.275 --> 01:22:48.180
It looks like everyone's been wiped out.

01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:52.230
That bastard planted something!

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.420
Sonoshee, you all right?

01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.980
JP.

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.560
You okay, Captain Sabose?

01:23:06.595 --> 01:23:07.735
I'm fine.

01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:09.965
How many planes are left?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.750
18, including the ones that are damaged.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.215
16 sand-bikers left in another unit.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.330
The crow jet unit's totally wiped out.

01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.995
I see...

01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:20.610
The RED-RACERS are in equally bad shape.

01:23:20.645 --> 01:23:22.410
Wait for Colonel Volton's order.

01:23:22.445 --> 01:23:23.290
Roger out.

01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:52.650
You came all this way to win REDLINE, right?

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.670
I'm only halfway there.

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.130
I didn't get to see the finish line.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:04.160
I'll show you. Not much room, but you don't mind, right?

01:24:04.195 --> 01:24:08.140
It'll be too heavy. You can't win.

01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:10.265
Yes, l will!

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.670
We'll win this together.

01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:26.410
That's sweet, JP, but I have to ask something.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.190
Ask me later. We've got a race to run.

01:24:31.225 --> 01:24:34.420
No. I need to ask you now.

01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:37.255
Okay, shoot.

01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:42.020
Have you been arrested for fixing a race?

01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:49.565
Yeah.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.660
What happened?

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.400
It was the Yellow MAX series eight years ago.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.270
Our team was on a hot winning streak.

01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:04.740
Frisbee decided to hook up with the mafia,

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.480
so he could get a better engine and parts.

01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:14.090
I entered the race with his life on the line...

01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:15.230
and I lost.

01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:19.400
After that, he desperately needed the money.

01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:24.560
But there was a sting operation against the Inuki gang.

01:25:24.595 --> 01:25:26.205
Frisbee was trapped.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:29.220
That friggin' Frisbee's gonna get JP killed!

01:25:29.255 --> 01:25:32.465
So you went to prison for him.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.950
He believed in me and risked his life so I could race.

01:25:36.985 --> 01:25:40.010
I'll always owe him for that.

01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:45.490
Then we'll just have to pay him back with this race!

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:51.810
You're gonna help me?

01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:58.820
If you'll help me make my dream come true.

01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:00.260
It's a deal!

01:26:16.050 --> 01:26:18.255
He can regenerate.

01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:20.560
There must have been some pieces of him left.

01:26:20.595 --> 01:26:21.795
Secretary Titan!

01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:25.070
Fire the hyper-disintegrator cannon again!

01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:29.260
Negative. We need another two hours to recharge it.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.485
Where's Volton now?

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:37.410
I never thought I'd see the day. Is it ready?

01:26:37.445 --> 01:26:38.652
Yes, it's ready!

01:26:38.687 --> 01:26:39.860
Can we control it?

01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:44.315
With your skill, no problem.

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:48.020
You just like the idea of getting new data, don't you?

01:26:48.055 --> 01:26:49.710
Very well. Proceed.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.280
Oh, no!

01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:01.000
Princess!

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.410
This feels great! Wonderful!

01:27:14.445 --> 01:27:16.570
I can feel the power!

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.600
Let's get out of here, Shinkai!

01:27:30.635 --> 01:27:31.334
Okay!

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.960
All right! Gori-police custom rider!

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.650
You morons! The RED-RACERS are on the move again.

01:27:54.685 --> 01:27:56.480
Go after them!

01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.695
Yes, sir!

01:27:57.730 --> 01:27:59.350
We should get going.

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:03.160
This is the machine your friend built...

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:03.990
Yeah.

01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:05.800
You ready?

01:28:05.835 --> 01:28:06.860
Yeah.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.465
With the beefed up stove you gave me,

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.290
Sonoshee and I will blast to the top!

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.290
Your friend has done well.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.105
Yes.

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.935
It's about time we wrapped this up.

01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:50.810
We're in third. The odds are looking up.

01:28:50.845 --> 01:28:52.475
That should give us enough.

01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:55.910
No reason to be greedy and end up in the hole.

01:28:55.945 --> 01:28:58.040
It's time for Plan B.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.350
Wait until JP grabs the lead, please.

01:29:01.690 --> 01:29:03.920
You promised me!

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.125
Then here's a check!

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.650
I'll double your pay this time. Take it!

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:14.135
We're running out of time.

01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:18.540
I'm paying both you and JP more than enough money.

01:29:18.575 --> 01:29:21.967
So why are you complaining? Give me the detonator!

01:29:22.002 --> 01:29:25.360
I just gotta see this race to the end. Please.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.075
We, no...

01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:30.610
I wanna see him win!

01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:38.055
Sorry, buddy.

01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:40.890
You know I'm just doing my job, right?

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.130
I don't wanna hurt you. Just hand me the damn thing.

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:51.190
Over my dead body!

01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:54.110
Suit yourself!

01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:00.680
Bye-bye!

01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:12.400
Old man, what are you doing here?

01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:16.790
I'll keep this with me for now.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.365
I didn't come here to save you, you know!

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.600
It's just that the team mechanic's gotta see the race through.

01:30:24.635 --> 01:30:26.840
The driver, the mechanic, and the junk dealer...

01:30:26.875 --> 01:30:30.440
Those three make a team, right?

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:36.045
In the lead, God Wing is struggling to stay in control.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.150
This time around, he's sustained quite a bit of damage.

01:30:39.185 --> 01:30:41.390
Hey! Move your ass!

01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:47.170
Damn! Don't you care about the road?

01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:52.250
This is awesome!

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.265
The outside is clear!

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.330
Can't do that at this speed.

01:30:56.365 --> 01:30:57.064
There!

01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:01.200
Go for it!

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.460
You're here.

01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:08.460
I've got you now.

01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:13.690
Are you bold enough to use the steamlight, Sonoshee?

01:31:13.725 --> 01:31:16.210
Huh? That's the same as yours...

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.560
As a courtesy to stubborn racers like you,

01:31:18.595 --> 01:31:21.060
I'm trying to make this interesting.

01:31:21.095 --> 01:31:22.120
Bring it on!

01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:27.630
Behold the platinum nitro charge!

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.025
Platinum nitro charge by Machine Head!

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.890
The only man to master the steamlight.

01:31:41.925 --> 01:31:44.720
Looks like the king's gonna win again!

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:51.225
Hey, Sonoshee!

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:53.950
We made a deal. Make my dream come true, JP!

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.430
Second place is mine!

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.140
Think you can get me?!

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.680
That fool! Steamlight?!

01:32:22.715 --> 01:32:24.660
No man can handle that!

01:32:24.695 --> 01:32:26.320
You can do it, JP!

01:32:26.355 --> 01:32:27.880
You serious?

01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:29.960
Dunno.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.940
Funny guy, huh? Let's see what he's got.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.540
Let's roll, Todoroki!

01:32:40.575 --> 01:32:41.360
Guts!

01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:47.230
Sorry, Deyzuna. Time's up.

01:32:47.265 --> 01:32:48.950
Let's go, Shinkai!

01:32:48.985 --> 01:32:50.607
Here we come!

01:32:50.642 --> 01:32:52.230
Don't leave me!

01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:07.660
Too hard to follow.

01:33:08.370 --> 01:33:10.330
No way we'll catch up.

01:33:10.365 --> 01:33:11.470
Hold on a minute!

01:33:11.505 --> 01:33:12.235
Huh?

01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:16.140
The finish line is on top of the Dest Tower.

01:33:16.175 --> 01:33:20.010
No one can climb up the wall to reach the line!

01:33:20.045 --> 01:33:20.840
What's gonna happen?

01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:22.675
What's the plan?

01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:24.320
You'll see. Just watch.

01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:33.429
What?!

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.095
Oh my!

01:33:35.130 --> 01:33:38.860
The REDLINE committee's mothership came out of hyperdimensional space under the Dest Tower

01:33:38.895 --> 01:33:40.860
and became the final straightaway!

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.305
You see?

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:47.870
The final straightaway has connected to the finish line!

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.840
Sonoshee!

01:33:53.875 --> 01:33:55.560
You ready?

01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:06.120
JP's moving up like a bullet! What's going on?

01:34:06.155 --> 01:34:09.140
Holy cow! Unbelievable!

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.335
I'm gonna win!

01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:17.100
I'm the king of kings! You know what that means?

01:34:17.135 --> 01:34:20.250
It means the victory belongs to me!

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.920
I'm gonna win!

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:24.880
I've got the goddess on my side!

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:35.920
Look at that! JP and Sonoshee are coming!

01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:57.140
I see it.

01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:11.660
JP! You need the edge to win REDLINE!

01:35:11.695 --> 01:35:15.730
You don't deserve to win this race!

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:22.230
Goddamn it! I need something to spark this thing up...

01:35:22.265 --> 01:35:24.530
Frisbee, got anything?!

01:35:24.565 --> 01:35:26.800
You used it all!

01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:38.235
Whoa! JP's engine got blown off!

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:40.840
But wait... he's picking up speed somehow!

01:36:10.450 --> 01:36:12.780
Victory's mine, JP!

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.830
JP!

01:36:17.890 --> 01:36:18.870
Sonoshee!

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.640
It's JP and Sonoshee! They win!

01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:05.140
JP and Sonoshee are first across the line!

01:37:05.175 --> 01:37:07.095
JP! JP!

01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:09.140
Sonoshee! Sonoshee!

01:37:09.175 --> 01:37:11.280
He's done it!

01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.680
Interesting...

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.610
Aw, that's beautiful.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.000
Sonoshee.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.500
I love you.

01:37:42.570 --> 01:37:45.290
Cool. I love you too, JP.
