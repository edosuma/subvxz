18:18.030 --> 18:19.165
I couldn't sleep,

18:19.165 --> 18:20.933
so I thought reading
about maritime law

18:20.933 --> 18:23.769
would do the trick
and put me out, but so far,

18:23.769 --> 18:25.972
I've gotten through
shrimp regulations.

18:25.972 --> 18:29.241
Okay.
Oh, is that the jacket?

18:29.241 --> 18:30.977
Oh, yeah, it is.

18:30.977 --> 18:34.013
I got the jacket back
and the design, too.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.281
That's amazing.
Mm‐hmm.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.950
And what happened
with the internship?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.353
Well,
the internship is history.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.456
But hey, wait.
At least I got this cool...

18:43.456 --> 18:45.057
stapler.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.226
Hmm. Parents gonna put that
in a frame

18:47.226 --> 18:48.995
instead of your diploma?
Ana, Ana, Ana,

18:48.995 --> 18:50.796
please let me have this.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.732
You're right. You're right.
I'm sorry.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.734
Congratulations on sticking up
for yourself.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.268
Thanks.

18:56.268 --> 18:59.939
So, what are you gonna do
with the jacket?

lie on your application,
