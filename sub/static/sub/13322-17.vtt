00:00.423 --> 00:01.455
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.490 --> 00:03.924
You made detective. Congratulations.

00:03.959 --> 00:05.225
They want to place you
in Human Trafficking.

00:05.261 --> 00:07.361
Drew Turner, this is Lena Adams Foster.

00:07.396 --> 00:10.264
Gays and lesbians are
left out of sex ed.

00:10.299 --> 00:12.132
You're on administrative
leave right now.

00:12.167 --> 00:15.002
How can I turn them away, kids who
can't come out to their parents?

00:15.037 --> 00:18.338
- Emma's pregnant?
- No, she isn't pregnant... anymore.

00:18.454 --> 00:22.389
I just can't face him and not tell
him the truth, so I wrote him this.

00:22.424 --> 00:25.192
Will you give it to him?

00:25.227 --> 00:28.028
While I'm fostering AJ,
you can't live with us.

00:28.063 --> 00:29.396
- Why?
- 'Cause of your felony.

00:29.431 --> 00:32.432
- I make a mean cinnamon bun.
- You like watching those buns rise?

00:32.468 --> 00:35.102
You know Callie, my girlfriend.

00:35.137 --> 00:38.238
Troy Johnson won't take the
settlement deal. We're going to trial.

00:38.273 --> 00:41.041
I'm gonna call the cops if
you ever come near me again!

00:42.244 --> 00:44.478
- All right. Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:44.513 --> 00:46.113
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

00:49.218 --> 00:52.185
Excuse me, do you have a moment
to talk about foster care reform?

00:52.221 --> 00:54.287
Don't your fancy lawyers
have investigators?

00:54.323 --> 00:57.024
- Why you still detectiving?
- They don't think Troy's guilty.

00:57.059 --> 01:00.160
They think I'm some kind of
crazy conspiracy theorist.

01:00.195 --> 01:02.195
- Are you?
- No.

01:02.231 --> 01:03.562
Excuse me for thinking

01:03.563 --> 01:04.833
that my boyfriend would want to help.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.401
I'm sure he does, but that doesn't
mean getting his ass arrested.

01:07.436 --> 01:10.203
- Yo, how long we gotta do this?
- An hour every day after school.

01:10.239 --> 01:12.239
Well, this is like slave labor.
Why we ain't getting paid?

01:12.274 --> 01:14.307
It's community service, and
you're getting school credit.

01:14.343 --> 01:16.209
- Like I...
- Watch it.

01:16.245 --> 01:18.311
You can sit on your ass, but
that's gonna cost you a U.A.

01:18.347 --> 01:19.980
Bitch.

01:22.017 --> 01:24.418
Can you shut your hole?
Damn, you ain't no BeyoncÃ©.

01:29.124 --> 01:32.192
Yo, I don't remember us throwing
that much shade when we were in G.U.

01:32.227 --> 01:35.228
They're not scared of
me yet. They stupid.

01:36.365 --> 01:38.398
How do you like being on the other side?

01:38.434 --> 01:39.675
I like the cooking...

01:40.076 --> 01:41.376
and kicking the girls' asses.

01:41.437 --> 01:44.337
I'm just grateful Rita gave me a job.

01:44.373 --> 01:47.140
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi.

01:47.176 --> 01:49.109
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:50.345 --> 01:52.279
- How we doing?
- We're getting some signatures.

01:52.314 --> 01:54.358
That's good. We need them.
Two weeks till the deadline,

01:54.359 --> 01:56.079
and we're still about 5,000 shy.

01:56.251 --> 01:58.351
- So, are we gonna make it?
- Hope so.

01:58.387 --> 02:01.221
Rita's up in Sacramento,
shaking some trees.

02:01.256 --> 02:04.357
- They give you any trouble?
- No more than usual.

02:04.393 --> 02:07.094
Mmm. Let me get these girls set up, huh?

02:07.129 --> 02:09.029
- So?
- What?

02:09.064 --> 02:11.164
What are you still doing here?
Go make it right with your man?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.300
- I mean, unless you don't want to.
- Okay, okay.

02:13.335 --> 02:15.068
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

02:15.104 --> 02:16.303
Excuse me.

02:19.174 --> 02:21.441
Car.

02:21.477 --> 02:23.043
Good.

02:25.447 --> 02:27.981
L... l... lamp.

02:28.016 --> 02:28.982
Nice.

02:34.223 --> 02:38.191
- Where's the... the picture?
- No. No picture this time.

02:39.294 --> 02:40.260
What's it say?

02:41.330 --> 02:45.031
Umm... it's the... the...

02:48.036 --> 02:50.403
I can't... I... I have a headache, Mama.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.306
No, you don't, Jesus.

02:55.210 --> 02:56.376
You can't read it, can you?

02:59.148 --> 03:03.283
Honey, why didn't you just tell us?

03:03.318 --> 03:09.156
Because I... I am so done with
the doctors, and the tests,

03:09.191 --> 03:11.391
and the... the stupid...

03:11.426 --> 03:13.960
t... therapy sessions.

03:17.099 --> 03:19.132
Why can't anyone...

03:22.037 --> 03:23.303
f... f... f... fix me?

03:29.111 --> 03:31.011
Okay, okay, okay.

- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:13.051 --> 04:14.251
The girl's name is Diamond.

04:14.286 --> 04:15.986
- She's 15.
- Oh my god.

04:16.021 --> 04:17.954
She's the same age as my youngest kid.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.289
Vice picked her up on 8th Street.

04:19.324 --> 04:21.358
Remember, she's the
victim, not the perp.

04:21.392 --> 04:24.294
The john got away, but
they saw him paying her.

04:24.329 --> 04:26.196
She get to keep any of the money?

04:26.231 --> 04:27.197
Not a penny.

04:27.232 --> 04:28.999
Well, what's in it for these girls?

04:29.034 --> 04:31.001
A lot of them come
outta the foster system.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.335
They're starved for a sense of family,

04:32.371 --> 04:34.271
some love, that they'll
do anything to get it.

04:34.306 --> 04:37.107
If we can't hold 'em,
what're we doing here?

04:37.142 --> 04:38.341
Planting seeds of hope.

04:38.377 --> 04:40.110
Here, you're gonna need these.

04:40.145 --> 04:41.278
Tanya's Hair Salon?

04:41.313 --> 04:43.413
The last thing these
girls want is to get caught

04:43.448 --> 04:45.382
by their pimps with a
cop's number on them.

04:53.358 --> 04:57.928
Hi, Diamond. This is
Officer Adams Foster.

04:57.963 --> 05:00.197
You got your good jeans on today, Margo.

05:00.232 --> 05:01.898
You must mean business.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.867
You were picked up at
8th and Monroe, right?

05:04.937 --> 05:06.937
- You on the stroll?
- I was just walking.

05:06.972 --> 05:08.338
Keepin' to myself. That a crime?

05:08.373 --> 05:10.106
I thought your pimp
had you working the ads?

05:10.142 --> 05:12.876
I already told you I ain't got no pimp,

05:12.911 --> 05:14.878
and y'all can't prove
I did a damn thing,

05:14.913 --> 05:16.112
so what the hell am I even doing here?

05:16.148 --> 05:17.214
Who's Russell?

05:18.383 --> 05:21.918
Russell Wilson. Love them Seahawks.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.020
Yeah? I do too. He can't do a damn thing

05:24.056 --> 05:26.356
without an offensive
line, though, can he?

05:26.391 --> 05:28.291
So he's not your pimp?
He didn't brand you?

05:30.395 --> 05:33.330
So, what happened? You're
not bottom bitch anymore?

05:33.365 --> 05:36.967
- What's that mean?
- Daddy's top earner.

05:38.303 --> 05:41.171
I need to take this. Hold on.

05:41.206 --> 05:44.140
DCFS is on their way to take you home.

05:44.176 --> 05:46.076
I'm just gonna take off.

05:46.111 --> 05:47.911
You don't have to do
this anymore, Diamond.

05:47.946 --> 05:50.380
One day, when you're ready, we're
gonna help you get out of the game.

05:58.957 --> 06:01.091
- You new at this, huh?
- Yeah.

06:01.126 --> 06:02.158
Is that obvious?

06:03.195 --> 06:04.361
Yeah, well, I may be new at this,

06:04.396 --> 06:06.997
but I'll tell you what. I'm
a pro at being stonewalled.

06:07.032 --> 06:09.165
I got five teenagers at home,

06:09.201 --> 06:11.301
all a pain in my ass.

06:12.337 --> 06:14.137
Just got these.

06:14.172 --> 06:16.172
Call me anytime.

06:19.945 --> 06:22.345
Ain't nobody gonna believe you do hair.

06:27.152 --> 06:28.318
How'd it go?

06:28.353 --> 06:31.354
Well, there's nothing
wrong with Jesus's eyes.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.089
It's his brain that can't read,

06:33.125 --> 06:34.324
so they're giving him these glasses

06:34.359 --> 06:36.092
and they're supposed to help

06:36.128 --> 06:37.928
his brain sort things out.

06:37.963 --> 06:39.963
Yeah, but they're...
they're not even working.

06:39.998 --> 06:42.365
I mean, I... I st... still can't read.

06:42.401 --> 06:45.101
Honey, you have to be patient, you know?

06:45.137 --> 06:47.103
The doctor said it might take a while.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.371
You look like a minion.

06:54.146 --> 06:55.378
They're... they're giving me a headache.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.048
Why don't you go ahead
and lie down, okay?

07:02.955 --> 07:04.220
Really, Brandon?

07:04.256 --> 07:07.023
- Minions are cute.
- And you're a jerk.

07:12.364 --> 07:15.131
Is he... getting worse?

07:15.167 --> 07:18.101
I noticed that his speech
is all messed up again.

07:18.136 --> 07:21.104
Yeah, I know. I talked
to his doctor about that.

07:21.105 --> 07:22.305
- _
- I mean, that's the thing with TBI.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.908
- _
- It's two steps forward, one step back.

07:24.943 --> 07:27.210
- The doctor's not worried about it. The only worry
- _

07:27.245 --> 07:29.346
is how it will affect Jesus's morale.

07:29.381 --> 07:32.282
Okay, so maybe comparing him

07:32.317 --> 07:35.051
to a cartoon character
isn't very helpful.

07:35.087 --> 07:36.186
Sorry.

07:42.227 --> 07:44.227
- Hello?
- Did you let students

07:44.262 --> 07:46.196
without permission slips
take the sex ed class?

07:49.101 --> 07:50.900
Uh...

07:50.936 --> 07:53.370
Drew saw a comment from a kid
online who says he was there.

07:53.405 --> 07:55.905
Of course he did.

07:55.941 --> 07:58.274
A kid whose permission
slip we do not have.

07:58.310 --> 08:01.011
How many were there?

08:02.147 --> 08:04.014
- Who's this?
- It's Drew.

08:05.183 --> 08:06.883
Umm...

08:08.153 --> 08:11.021
Kids without permission slips.
I think there were about six.

08:11.056 --> 08:12.122
Six?

08:13.225 --> 08:15.025
What if this gets flagged
by the parent board

08:15.060 --> 08:16.292
or the department of education?

08:16.328 --> 08:19.229
If there are any repercussions,
I will take full responsibility.

08:19.264 --> 08:22.298
N... no, you won't. I will,
because you're on leave.

08:57.653 --> 09:01.005
He kissed her? Oh my
god, I'm gonna kill him.

09:01.016 --> 09:05.084
Well, she kissed him, and
he didn't exactly pull away.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.954
Still... it's not cool.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.957
Yeah, but when Aaron kissed me,

09:10.992 --> 09:13.092
I didn't pull away, and
that didn't mean anything.

09:13.128 --> 09:15.161
So? That's different.

09:15.197 --> 09:16.329
It is? Why?

09:16.364 --> 09:19.098
I don't know. 'Cause you're my sister.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.037
He has been...

09:24.072 --> 09:26.272
kinda mad at me lately.

09:26.308 --> 09:28.174
He's been so preoccupied.

09:28.210 --> 09:31.244
Well, that's... kind of understandable.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.112
I mean, you could
totally be going to jail.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.916
I mean... you're not going to jail.

09:40.989 --> 09:43.223
Maybe he's... he's feeling neglected.

09:43.258 --> 09:47.126
Maybe AJ just needs a
little bit of reassurance.

09:47.162 --> 09:49.295
Maybe he needs to feel
like you're still into him.

09:53.034 --> 09:56.369
- What if she tries to fire me?
- She can't fire you, love.

09:56.404 --> 09:58.395
Not while you're on leave. It's...

09:58.396 --> 10:00.696
it's against the law.
You could sue them.

10:01.009 --> 10:02.141
Well, Monte still has the option

10:02.177 --> 10:04.310
not to pick up my contract,
which is coming up,

10:04.346 --> 10:06.246
and I'm pretty sure that
Drew is gunning for my job

10:06.281 --> 10:09.182
by kissing Monte's
ass, possibly literally.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.117
Okay, let's be honest.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.987
Do you really think she's
coming on to him now?

10:14.022 --> 10:17.090
She's bisexual. Drew is very handsome,

10:17.125 --> 10:19.392
who knows? We know this woman
has trouble with boundaries.

10:19.427 --> 10:22.295
Okay, well, honestly, I think
you're being a little paranoid.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.164
- Oh, really?
- I do, yeah.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.559
Okay. Why is Drew leaving me off

10:27.560 --> 10:29.180
important emails coming from his office?

10:29.437 --> 10:30.958
I just found out there's a board meeting

10:30.959 --> 10:32.402
tomorrow to discuss accreditation.

10:32.407 --> 10:34.140
Whether I'm on leave or not,

10:34.175 --> 10:36.242
I'm in charge of
accreditation. Drew knows that.

10:42.284 --> 10:44.050
I think you look cute in your glasses.

10:44.085 --> 10:45.451
Like Clark Kent.

10:45.487 --> 10:49.022
Mm-hmm. No. You mean Urkel?

10:51.092 --> 10:52.225
You're gonna get better.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.161
Yeah, you know, the more
that p... people say that...

10:56.264 --> 10:58.131
the less that I... I believe it.

10:59.401 --> 11:02.068
Are you drawing again? Can I see?

11:02.103 --> 11:03.069
No.

11:04.139 --> 11:05.204
Okay. Fine.

11:07.175 --> 11:10.977
- Look... Mariana!
- Oh, this is so cool.

11:11.012 --> 11:13.146
Do you remember those
Magic Tree House books?

11:13.181 --> 11:17.216
About the tree house that
could travel back in time?

11:17.252 --> 11:19.952
Yeah.

11:19.988 --> 11:24.023
Yeah, those were... were the first
chapter books that I ever read.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.392
You used to say I was
just like the sister.

11:26.428 --> 11:29.295
She was always getting her
brother into some crazy adventure.

11:30.869 --> 11:33.065
We used to always want a
magic tree house of our own.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.301
Yeah, I wish that we had one.

11:35.337 --> 11:41.307
Then I... I'd go back in time
before any of this happened.

11:52.387 --> 11:54.320
- Hey, sweets.
- Hey.

11:54.356 --> 11:56.356
Hey. Is... is everything
all right with Callie?

11:56.391 --> 11:58.257
She... she barely said
a word when she came home.

11:58.293 --> 12:00.193
Oh, uh, fine.

12:00.228 --> 12:02.929
- Girl stuff.
- Mariana.

12:05.033 --> 12:07.033
Okay, you didn't hear it from me,

12:07.068 --> 12:09.135
but Callie saw AJ kissing another girl.

12:09.170 --> 12:12.171
Is she okay? Should we talk to her?

12:12.207 --> 12:13.940
No. You're not supposed to know.

12:13.975 --> 12:15.375
- Mariana.
- They'll work it out.

12:15.410 --> 12:18.244
Okay, but you know who isn't all right?

12:18.279 --> 12:21.280
Jesus. He needs a project,

12:21.316 --> 12:23.082
you know, something to look forward to,

12:23.118 --> 12:25.017
and I have an idea.

12:25.053 --> 12:26.437
Oh my god, your ideas scare me.

12:26.438 --> 12:27.928
Should we be sitting down for this one?

12:30.225 --> 12:35.161
Okay, so Jesus has been watching
this show about tree houses,

12:35.196 --> 12:37.655
and he's actually been
designing his own sketches,

12:37.656 --> 12:38.426
and they're really good.

12:38.433 --> 12:41.267
- See?
- Oh wow, look at that.

12:41.302 --> 12:45.238
What if we asked Gabe
to help him build one?

12:45.273 --> 12:48.007
Oh no, absolutely not.
Jesus is in this condition

12:48.042 --> 12:50.309
because of Gabe and his nail gun.

12:50.345 --> 12:53.279
Okay, but Gabe wasn't
there to supervise Jesus,

12:53.314 --> 12:56.082
and Jesus won't have to do
any of the actual building.

12:56.117 --> 12:58.184
He could be like... the architect.

12:58.219 --> 13:00.080
All right, all right,
exactly how do you intend

13:00.081 --> 13:03.022
to pay for all these materials?
We certainly can't afford all that.

13:03.057 --> 13:04.991
- See, I anticipated that question.
- Of course you did.

13:05.026 --> 13:09.295
What if... this was
Jesus's senior project?

13:09.330 --> 13:10.652
There have been juniors
that were allowed

13:10.653 --> 13:11.910
to start their senior project early,

13:12.300 --> 13:16.169
and if he builds the tree
house in a park or playground,

13:16.204 --> 13:20.273
he could apply for some of
ABCC's community outreach budget

13:20.308 --> 13:22.275
and he can fund raise
through the school.

13:22.310 --> 13:25.011
Well, I don't think it's a bad idea.

13:25.046 --> 13:27.246
It could help Jesus get
out of his depression.

13:27.282 --> 13:29.182
It can help his brain make connections.

13:30.218 --> 13:32.985
And the design is pretty cool,

13:33.021 --> 13:35.221
but you would still need
to get faculty approval.

13:35.256 --> 13:38.157
Perfect. Vice-Principal. Approved. Done.

13:38.193 --> 13:41.994
Honey, I'm not the acting VP. Drew
will still have to sign off on this.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.996
Well, can you at least
put in a good word?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.200
I will do what I can.

13:50.238 --> 13:53.272
Hey. How's basketball practice?

13:53.308 --> 13:55.408
Oh. We didn't have practice today,

13:55.443 --> 13:58.311
so I... just played a little pickup.

13:58.346 --> 13:59.278
Oh.

14:00.949 --> 14:04.984
Hey, so have you given any
more thought to me adopting you?

14:05.019 --> 14:07.253
No pressure, just checking in.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.122
I know why you wanna adopt me.

14:12.293 --> 14:15.094
- Don't worry about it.
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:16.231 --> 14:18.364
I know Ana can't move
in here while I'm...

14:18.399 --> 14:20.933
- being fostered by you, so...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

14:20.969 --> 14:23.369
That's... that's not why
I wanna adopt you, AJ.

14:23.404 --> 14:27.273
I mean, sure, it pushed me to get
off my butt and actually ask, but...

14:27.308 --> 14:29.976
I meant everything I said.

14:30.044 --> 14:33.112
You're family to me, I love you,
and I want to make it official.

14:37.185 --> 14:39.218
Ty wants me to move in
with him when he gets out.

14:41.990 --> 14:43.022
Is that what you want?

14:48.062 --> 14:49.328
I can't say no to my brother.

14:51.366 --> 14:54.233
- It's okay. I understand.
- Look, I don't wanna be in the way.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.235
I... I can go live with
another foster family,

14:56.271 --> 14:58.004
and I'm gonna be 18 soon, anyways, so...

14:58.039 --> 15:00.106
Absolutely not, AJ.

15:00.141 --> 15:02.942
You're the priority here.
Ana and I'll be fine.

15:02.977 --> 15:05.144
- You sure?
- Yes.

15:06.314 --> 15:09.315
All right. I'm gonna go get a shower.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.253
Okay. I gotta get to work.
Dinner's in the fridge.

15:18.359 --> 15:21.360
- Hey.
- Hey. Is AJ here?

15:21.396 --> 15:24.130
Yeah, I think he just
hopped in the shower,

15:24.165 --> 15:26.165
but feel free to hang out.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.366
Great. Thanks.

15:55.029 --> 15:57.296
- Whoa! What the...
- It's just me. It's just me.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.131
Oh god. I almost decked you.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.300
Sorry. Mike let me in
when he was leaving.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.640
- I thought...
- Are you sure he's gone?

16:02.705 --> 16:06.072
- What if he comes back?
- I don't know. It seemed like...

16:06.107 --> 16:08.307
I'm just... trying to take a shower.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.311
I'm sorry I ruined that for you.

16:15.294 --> 16:17.050
Hey, look, I didn't mean
to be a jerk. You just...

16:17.051 --> 16:17.970
you caught me by surprise.

16:18.094 --> 16:20.060
- Yeah.
- Come on. I'm sorry.

16:20.096 --> 16:21.829
Can you move please?
I just wanna go home.

16:21.864 --> 16:23.897
Why are you being like
this? I just said I'm sorry.

16:23.933 --> 16:25.032
Why are you being like this?

16:27.169 --> 16:29.937
- Please just let me leave.
- No. I don't want you to.

16:32.842 --> 16:34.742
Fine. Go.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.753
Are we okay?

16:57.099 --> 16:58.799
I know I've been...

16:59.969 --> 17:02.102
wrapped up in my own world lately.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.675
And you're right. I haven't been
paying enough attention to you.

17:09.712 --> 17:11.645
Callie, I'm not a kid. I don't...

17:12.882 --> 17:14.815
need attention. I just want you to...

17:16.152 --> 17:18.786
... be like...

17:18.820 --> 17:21.855
... here with me, when we're together.

17:21.891 --> 17:24.657
Well, I'm here now.

17:31.066 --> 17:32.966
I told Mike I don't wanna get adopted.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.739
How'd he take it?

17:41.010 --> 17:42.009
He was cool.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.113
Tried to act like it didn't bother him.

17:48.184 --> 17:51.919
I feel bad, though, 'cause
he's done a lot for me.

17:54.723 --> 17:57.858
I can't abandon my brother. I
don't wanna hurt either of them.

18:02.965 --> 18:07.067
Hey, when my birth-dad...

18:07.102 --> 18:10.938
showed up in my life,
I had to make a choice...

18:13.776 --> 18:17.644
and I chose what felt like home.

18:18.747 --> 18:20.047
And I didn't want to hurt Robert,

18:20.082 --> 18:23.684
but sometimes we...

18:23.719 --> 18:25.953
just have to do what is right for us.

18:28.724 --> 18:30.090
And Robert was fine.

18:33.829 --> 18:34.962
And Mike will be too.

19:07.696 --> 19:08.695
Oh.

19:14.703 --> 19:18.839
Hey. You haven't seen my good
sneakers around here, have you?

19:18.874 --> 19:20.874
'Cause Grace is gonna be
here, I think, any minute.

19:22.678 --> 19:24.711
Forget the shoes.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.781
You need to lose the animal
print before you get friend-zoned.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.020
What's wrong with my shirt?

19:29.021 --> 19:31.915
It's got a bunch of tiny,
little foxes on it. See?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.657
I'll change.

19:36.692 --> 19:40.761
- What's that?
- Umm, it's the letter

19:40.796 --> 19:43.864
that Emma wrote to Jesus.

19:45.134 --> 19:47.734
- And what are you doing with it?
- Well, Jesus didn't read it,

19:47.770 --> 19:51.972
because he... he can't, and Emma
didn't want anyone else finding it.

19:52.007 --> 19:54.141
So, why doesn't she just tell him?

19:54.176 --> 19:56.810
Well, she realized that with
everything else going on,

19:56.845 --> 19:59.846
- it... it was gonna be too much.
- Okay, well...

19:59.882 --> 20:03.083
I don't think that she should be
putting you in the middle of this.

20:03.118 --> 20:05.358
And for your sake, I hope
that he never finds out

20:05.359 --> 20:06.459
that you knew all along.

20:10.859 --> 20:12.759
Thank you.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.128
- Hey.
- Hey, they told me you were coming.

20:15.164 --> 20:17.030
I was the responding officer.

20:17.066 --> 20:19.800
A john roughed up the
girl in a motel room.

20:19.835 --> 20:21.969
- Did you get the john?
- Yeah, he's in custody.

20:22.004 --> 20:23.937
We're gonna have to take her
in after she gets checked out.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.840
- For what?
- Possession. Found codeine in her purse.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.810
Yup.

20:29.845 --> 20:31.845
Okay, thank you.

20:36.852 --> 20:39.186
- Hey. Can I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

20:52.868 --> 20:54.968
You... you wanna tell me what happened?

20:56.071 --> 20:57.070
This...

20:58.807 --> 21:01.141
This... guy paid me...

21:02.878 --> 21:04.111
120 bucks...

21:05.714 --> 21:06.847
which means he can...

21:08.150 --> 21:10.050
basically do whatever he wants.

21:11.887 --> 21:13.754
We were drinking some lean.

21:14.790 --> 21:15.856
What's that, honey?

21:17.092 --> 21:18.992
Soda and cough syrup.

21:20.763 --> 21:24.097
He drunk way too much,
got all tweaked out.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.168
And he got real aggressive...

21:29.805 --> 21:31.905
and he was hurting me.

21:33.175 --> 21:35.842
And... when I tried to...

21:37.012 --> 21:40.047
fight him off, he just...

21:40.082 --> 21:41.915
started throwing punches...

21:44.920 --> 21:47.888
kept... yelling that I was his bitch.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.891
Then the cops came.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.061
Someone at the motel must've called 'em.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.700
I'm glad you called me.

22:01.170 --> 22:03.904
Russell gonna be mad
as hell I got busted.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.807
Probably beat me worse.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.981
I can't do this anymore.

22:17.119 --> 22:19.853
I want out of this, but...

22:21.957 --> 22:23.724
if I try to leave...

22:24.893 --> 22:26.026
he'll kill me.

22:26.061 --> 22:28.128
Okay, well, listen,
we're gonna protect you.

22:28.163 --> 22:30.097
Do you hear me? If you
help us build a case

22:30.132 --> 22:32.065
against your pimp, against Russell,

22:32.101 --> 22:33.734
we're gonna put him behind bars

22:33.769 --> 22:34.968
where he can't hurt you ever again.

22:35.003 --> 22:37.137
But they said...

22:37.172 --> 22:39.940
they said they were sending me to juvie.

22:39.975 --> 22:44.711
- Mm-hmm.
- And... he got members of his gang in there,

22:44.747 --> 22:47.180
and they'll... they'll jump me for sure,

22:47.216 --> 22:50.117
especially if they think I'm
trying to roll over on him.

22:51.220 --> 22:52.919
I'm not safe anywhere.

23:05.011 --> 23:06.110
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

23:07.313 --> 23:09.947
This is tougher than I thought.

23:09.983 --> 23:12.833
These girls are so
young, they're so broken,

23:12.834 --> 23:14.910
and there's so many of them.

23:15.054 --> 23:18.889
Well, you know, get one girl off
the street, that's something, right?

23:21.294 --> 23:25.129
You should go home, man. You've
been here all night. Thank you.

23:25.164 --> 23:28.232
It's not like it's a rush. I
don't have anyone to go home to,

23:28.267 --> 23:30.101
and AJ's hardly ever there anymore.

23:30.136 --> 23:33.037
Well, what about Ana?
She's moving in, right?

23:33.072 --> 23:35.139
- Uh, no.
- What?

23:35.174 --> 23:37.141
AJ doesn't want me to adopt him.

23:37.176 --> 23:39.176
He's got his mind set on
moving in with his brother

23:39.212 --> 23:40.378
when he gets out of prison, so...

23:40.413 --> 23:42.279
Ah. I'm sorry, man.

23:42.315 --> 23:44.248
I know how much you care about him.

23:44.283 --> 23:48.019
Well, I gotta be honest. I'm a
little mad at AJ myself these days.

23:48.054 --> 23:50.921
Why?

23:50.957 --> 23:54.325
Callie apparently saw
AJ kissing another girl.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.862
Well, contrary to your belief,
I think that it's Callie

23:57.897 --> 23:59.864
that's getting hurt in
this relationship, not AJ.

24:03.102 --> 24:05.136
Don't worry. It's
Saturday. No one's here.

24:05.171 --> 24:08.873
Good, 'cause I look like a... dork.

24:08.908 --> 24:10.307
No, you don't.

24:10.343 --> 24:13.310
Think of your helmet and
glasses as a fashion statement.

24:13.346 --> 24:15.179
You're basically a hipster
without even trying.

24:15.214 --> 24:17.882
Why are you wearing your glasses?

24:19.085 --> 24:21.352
- Just felt like it.
- Jesus!

24:21.387 --> 24:23.020
What's up, bro?

24:24.223 --> 24:25.356
When are you coming back to school?

24:26.926 --> 24:28.159
Soon. Soon.

24:28.194 --> 24:31.996
You... you guys are
winning the meeting today?

24:32.031 --> 24:33.297
You mean the meet?

24:33.332 --> 24:36.000
Yeah, yeah, we're up by a couple points,

24:36.035 --> 24:38.235
but we actually gotta head back.

24:38.271 --> 24:40.938
It was good seeing you,
dude. And the shades are dope.

24:40.973 --> 24:41.939
Okay.

24:43.142 --> 24:44.208
You ready to do this?

24:45.311 --> 24:46.277
You're gonna be great.

24:50.349 --> 24:52.249
Hi, Drew, are you ready for us?

24:52.285 --> 24:53.984
Yes, come on in.

24:55.288 --> 24:58.889
You must be Jesus. Nice to meet you.

24:58.925 --> 25:00.157
Please, take a seat.

25:00.193 --> 25:02.259
Thank you for seeing us on a Saturday.

25:02.295 --> 25:06.163
Oh, no worries. Had to come in
for a parent board meeting anyway.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.100
Well, let's hear it.

25:19.178 --> 25:22.012
- Is this a tree house?
- Yes.

25:23.116 --> 25:25.015
I want to...

25:28.020 --> 25:29.286
to build it.

25:39.198 --> 25:42.366
- By the way, me and AJ are good now.
- You finally talk to him?

25:42.401 --> 25:44.268
Yeah, we just needed to reconnect.

25:44.303 --> 25:47.905
You mean hook up. Oh,
you nasty. I like it.

25:49.308 --> 25:52.109
Your mom's here.

25:56.415 --> 25:59.250
- Who's that girl?
- I don't know.

26:00.987 --> 26:03.220
Hey. Thank you so much for
doing this on such short notice.

26:03.256 --> 26:05.089
- Thank Rita.
- Okay.

26:05.124 --> 26:06.223
So, you're Diamond.

26:08.094 --> 26:09.226
Yeah.

26:21.174 --> 26:23.974
I don't appreciate
being left off emails.

26:24.010 --> 26:26.110
What are you talking about?

26:26.145 --> 26:28.279
Kim had to inform me
about today's meeting.

26:28.314 --> 26:30.881
She thought it was a little
odd that I wasn't CC'ed.

26:32.018 --> 26:33.284
I'm sure it was a mistake.

26:35.087 --> 26:37.154
No one purposefully left you off.

26:37.190 --> 26:39.290
Why wouldn't we want you here?

26:41.093 --> 26:43.961
I don't know. It doesn't
feel like a mistake.

26:43.996 --> 26:46.197
Everybody please take your seats.

26:46.232 --> 26:49.266
Before we talk about accreditation,

26:49.302 --> 26:52.203
I would like to...

26:54.106 --> 26:56.040
address a complaint that I received

26:56.075 --> 26:58.876
from a concerned parent
about a school-sponsored

26:58.911 --> 27:02.112
gay sex education class
their daughter attended.

27:04.917 --> 27:09.019
That class was not... was not
affiliated with Anchor Beach.

27:09.055 --> 27:12.890
As a concerned parent,
not vice-principal,

27:12.925 --> 27:16.894
I organized an LGBT
sex ed class off campus

27:16.929 --> 27:20.130
to educate those kids who were
being left out, my son included.

27:20.166 --> 27:23.167
Well, then why were Anchor
Beach permission slips required?

27:24.237 --> 27:27.871
I insisted Lena get them
for exactly this reason,

27:27.907 --> 27:30.174
to prevent any parental backlash.

27:30.209 --> 27:32.977
Some kids showed up
afraid of the consequences

27:33.012 --> 27:34.211
of outting themselves to their parents

27:34.247 --> 27:36.180
if they asked them to
sign a permission slip.

27:36.215 --> 27:38.983
And I understand where
Lena was coming from.

27:39.018 --> 27:42.253
All these students wanted was to
attend a basic sex education class,

27:42.288 --> 27:45.289
not much different from the one
we offer to all our other students.

27:45.324 --> 27:48.092
Yes, but I... I accept
full responsibility.

27:48.127 --> 27:51.161
Well, this doesn't
really fall on you, Lena.

27:51.197 --> 27:53.330
I mean, it's one thing
if you, as a parent,

27:53.366 --> 27:55.266
want to organize an event off-campus,

27:55.301 --> 27:57.234
but to require...

27:57.270 --> 28:02.139
a permission slip from ABCC,
that implicates the school.

28:02.174 --> 28:04.074
So, really, it's...

28:05.144 --> 28:06.176
It's on Monte.

28:08.881 --> 28:11.982
Monte was only trying
to protect Anchor Beach.

28:12.018 --> 28:15.185
Well, perhaps if this
wasn't an accreditation year,

28:15.221 --> 28:17.154
we could look the other way, but...

28:18.291 --> 28:20.157
we've discussed it, and we feel we need

28:20.192 --> 28:23.093
to get ahead of things, and
show the board of education

28:23.129 --> 28:25.129
that we are taking
the appropriate action.

28:25.164 --> 28:27.965
- Which is?
- We're asking you to resign.

28:35.134 --> 28:37.435
Ugh. I felt terrible.

28:38.368 --> 28:41.102
Tried to talk to her after the
meeting, she wouldn't even look at me.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.370
Not that I could blame her.

28:42.405 --> 28:45.173
I mean, I guess I feel sorry
for her, but she made a bad call,

28:45.208 --> 28:46.941
it's not the first time, either.

28:48.211 --> 28:50.144
Who's... who's gonna be replacing her?

28:50.180 --> 28:52.079
Well, we don't know yet,

28:52.115 --> 28:55.016
but Drew's gonna cover
both jobs for now.

28:55.051 --> 28:58.119
You should've seen his face at
the meeting. He was shell-shocked.

28:58.154 --> 29:01.055
I told him I would try to come back
as soon as I can to help, but...

29:01.090 --> 29:04.125
Well... well, maybe they're
finally gonna make you principal.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.961
Oh. Pfft. Yeah, well, I don't
think I even want it, not like this.

29:08.131 --> 29:10.097
Well... hey, love.

29:10.133 --> 29:13.134
- How was the rest of your afternoon?
- It was good, fine.

29:13.169 --> 29:16.904
We had to find a new place
to get signatures, though.

29:16.940 --> 29:19.240
We got everyone that shops there,
and they all know to avoid us.

29:19.275 --> 29:22.143
Who's this Diamond girl?

29:23.246 --> 29:25.880
- Diamond?
- Keep an eye out for her, would you?

29:25.915 --> 29:28.115
She's... she's a good girl, and
she's had a bit of a rough time.

29:28.151 --> 29:29.984
Why don't you go ahead and
get washed up for dinner?

29:30.019 --> 29:32.220
- Maybe come help us.
- Nah.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.126
Hey, so... I've been thinking.

29:41.164 --> 29:44.065
Ana and Isabelle can take
the one-bedroom down the hall.

29:44.100 --> 29:45.266
That way they'll be close by,

29:45.301 --> 29:47.068
but technically not living here.

29:47.103 --> 29:48.269
And then, when Ty gets out,

29:48.304 --> 29:50.204
you guys move into the one-bedroom

29:50.240 --> 29:53.174
- and Ana and Isabelle move in with me.
- Uh...

29:54.944 --> 29:57.945
I don't think Ty and I are gonna
be able to afford a place like that.

29:57.981 --> 30:01.949
You know, I can pay the rent
till you guys get on your feet.

30:01.985 --> 30:03.600
I mean, I... I've been saving the money

30:03.601 --> 30:05.211
the state sends for fostering you,

30:05.321 --> 30:07.221
I was gonna give it to you anyway.

30:08.958 --> 30:11.192
Now I can use it for this.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.327
I mean, that is if you want me to.

30:15.999 --> 30:19.200
I'll take that as a yes.

30:19.235 --> 30:21.936
- Yes.
- All right.

30:30.146 --> 30:31.946
Hey, everything okay with Callie?

30:33.049 --> 30:36.350
- You two still a thing?
- Yeah. Why?

30:45.295 --> 30:47.028
So, are you settling in okay?

30:47.063 --> 30:49.096
Everyone's being nice to you?

30:49.132 --> 30:50.364
They're all right.

30:52.368 --> 30:54.335
Well, Daphne's good people...

30:54.370 --> 30:56.090
you know, if you ever need anyone

30:56.091 --> 30:57.561
to talk to or anything.

30:58.107 --> 31:02.009
The girls were saying
that you're Stef's kid,

31:02.045 --> 31:06.147
- and you was in G.U.
- Yeah. And she and her wife

31:06.182 --> 31:09.884
- adopted me and my brother.
- So, Stef's a lez.

31:09.919 --> 31:13.120
That's what I thought
with that hair and all.

31:13.156 --> 31:17.091
Yeah, you're really lucky
that Stef got you into G.U.

31:17.126 --> 31:19.327
It's a big deal.

31:19.362 --> 31:22.196
Yeah. I know.

31:33.176 --> 31:37.044
Hey, honey. Umm...

31:37.080 --> 31:38.240
So, I spoke with Drew,

31:38.241 --> 31:41.200
and he's not going to approve
Jesus's senior project.

31:42.985 --> 31:46.187
- Wait. Why not?
- Well, he loved the idea,

31:46.222 --> 31:49.990
but... he's just not
convinced that Jesus will...

31:50.026 --> 31:51.325
will be a senior next year

31:51.361 --> 31:54.095
or even if he'll be back
at Anchor Beach at all.

31:54.130 --> 31:57.331
He thinks... we might have to
send him to a special school.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.169
Well, he's getting better. Isn't he?

32:02.205 --> 32:05.106
He is, but with TBI's
there can be setbacks.

32:05.141 --> 32:08.309
I mean, he's... he can't read right
now, he's missing a lot of school.

32:08.344 --> 32:11.912
Okay, well, what if he goes
to summer school to catch up?

32:11.948 --> 32:13.347
Maybe, if he can,

32:13.383 --> 32:15.282
but we... but we just don't know yet.

32:15.318 --> 32:17.184
You can't tell him this right now.

32:17.220 --> 32:18.886
It'll crush him even more.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.989
I know.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.925
I just got his hopes up, and
now I have to let him down again.

32:49.660 --> 32:53.461
- Thirteen, actually.
- Um, can I use the bathroom?

32:53.497 --> 32:57.198
- Yeah, I have to take you, though.
- I'll take her.

33:07.144 --> 33:08.410
Hey, yeah, so listen.

33:40.577 --> 33:42.410
- Who's this?
- Daddy?

33:43.714 --> 33:46.381
- It's me, Diamond.
- What happened? Where the hell you been?

33:46.416 --> 33:49.284
I know, Daddy. I'm sorry.

33:49.319 --> 33:54.155
This john went all crazy on
me, and someone called the cops.

33:55.325 --> 33:58.493
- I... I got arrested.
- You idiot.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.565
Don't be mad, Daddy.

34:05.268 --> 34:07.469
- Please?
- Yo, whose phone are you calling me from?

34:07.504 --> 34:10.505
It's a... cop's daughter.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.141
She... she helps out at the home...

34:13.176 --> 34:14.542
the group home they put me in.

34:14.578 --> 34:16.377
You're calling me from a cop's phone?

34:16.413 --> 34:19.147
- You stupid? How stupid are you?
- No.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.516
It... it ain't a cop's phone.

34:21.551 --> 34:23.251
It's her daughter's.

34:24.454 --> 34:27.255
Wait, wait, so you're in a group home?

34:27.290 --> 34:29.389
Yeah.

34:29.426 --> 34:32.226
They ain't got me locked up or nothing.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.530
You can come get me.

34:42.505 --> 34:44.205
Please, Daddy.

34:47.177 --> 34:49.409
- I love you.
- Hey, listen to me.

34:49.446 --> 34:51.513
I love you too, right?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.514
But you know what you gotta do, right,

34:53.550 --> 34:56.384
to get back with me,
for messing up my money?

34:58.421 --> 35:00.255
You gotta bring me one
of those girls, baby.

35:04.047 --> 35:07.115
Guess what? Drew approved
your senior project.

35:07.150 --> 35:09.351
Wait, really? No... no way.

35:09.386 --> 35:12.120
Well, kind of.

35:12.155 --> 35:14.055
He said it needed to
be both of our projects,

35:14.091 --> 35:16.157
because it was so expensive and all.

35:16.193 --> 35:20.328
Y... you want this
to be your... project?

35:20.364 --> 35:22.130
Yeah. Why not?

35:22.165 --> 35:25.300
I can be, like, the project manager,

35:25.335 --> 35:27.969
and you know I'm very good
at bossing people around.

35:28.005 --> 35:30.205
And that way we can be done

35:30.240 --> 35:31.940
and not have to worry about it next year

35:31.975 --> 35:33.074
when everyone else is freaking out.

35:38.248 --> 35:42.083
- Thank you.
- Now all we need to do is get Gabe onboard.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.053
What's that?

35:46.323 --> 35:49.391
It's, uh, The Magic Tree House.

35:49.426 --> 35:52.994
The one where they go to the
Ice Age. I found it in the attic.

36:04.374 --> 36:05.340
Umm...

36:07.144 --> 36:08.109
Do you wanna...

36:09.179 --> 36:10.278
read it to me?

36:18.055 --> 36:21.056
"One summer day in Frog
Creek, Pennsylvania,

36:21.091 --> 36:23.358
a mysterious tree house
appeared in the woods."

36:25.095 --> 36:27.262
"Eight-year-old Jack

36:27.297 --> 36:29.164
and his seven-year-old sister, Annie,

36:29.199 --> 36:30.932
climbed into the tree house."

36:35.972 --> 36:38.373
- Hey, love.
- What are you doing here?

36:38.408 --> 36:41.176
Oh, you know, just in the neighborhood.

36:41.211 --> 36:44.946
Okay. Hey. Okay?

36:44.981 --> 36:48.049
- Yeah.
- Hey, Diamond. How are ya?

36:48.085 --> 36:50.385
- Everything okay at G.U.?
- Yeah, it's good.

36:50.420 --> 36:54.155
- Good.
- Thanks for getting me in.

36:56.259 --> 37:00.095
- I know I'm really lucky, so...
- It's no problem.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.896
No problem.

37:03.300 --> 37:07.402
Uh, any more thoughts on helping
us get Russell off the street?

37:09.272 --> 37:11.106
Yeah. I'll do it.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.974
That's good. I'm really
happy to hear that.

37:14.010 --> 37:15.176
You're not just saving yourself.

37:15.212 --> 37:16.978
You know, you're gonna
save a lot of girls.

37:19.049 --> 37:21.382
I'll go with you into the station
tomorrow, talk to the team, all right?

37:21.418 --> 37:23.284
Mmm. Okay.

37:23.320 --> 37:27.122
I should probably go and
get some more signatures.

37:27.157 --> 37:30.058
I'm not... I'm not doing too good, so...

37:30.093 --> 37:33.194
- All right. Got it. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

37:41.304 --> 37:43.371
You have a very pretty singing voice.

37:43.406 --> 37:46.241
Girl, tell me something I don't know.

37:46.276 --> 37:50.211
No, for real. You could be big-time.

37:51.414 --> 37:53.281
I definitely see that for you.

37:54.317 --> 37:56.951
I actually know a music producer.

37:56.987 --> 38:00.955
My boyfriend. He came up
in the hood with Kendrick.

38:00.991 --> 38:02.706
- Wow.
- He could probably hook you up

38:02.707 --> 38:04.007
with a record deal or something.

38:04.227 --> 38:05.927
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

38:05.962 --> 38:07.061
- No way.
- For real.

38:07.097 --> 38:09.164
What? Oh, that's... okay, that's dope.

38:09.199 --> 38:12.200
What do you think of her?

38:14.104 --> 38:15.303
I think she's gonna be okay.

38:16.940 --> 38:19.040
I could've ended up like her

38:19.075 --> 38:21.042
or any of these girls

38:21.077 --> 38:22.377
if you hadn't rescued me and Jude.

38:22.412 --> 38:24.345
You guys were always
meant to be our kids.

38:24.381 --> 38:27.048
You know? I love you.

38:27.083 --> 38:29.050
Oh, I love you too.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.190
_

38:47.191 --> 38:50.090
_

39:01.318 --> 39:03.251
We're sorry.

39:03.286 --> 39:06.154
You've reached a number
that is no longer in service.

39:11.995 --> 39:15.063
So, I didn't want to
say this over the phone,

39:15.098 --> 39:17.232
and I probably shouldn't
be talking about it at all,

39:17.267 --> 39:21.169
but... it wasn't a parent who
told Lauren about the sex ed class.

39:21.204 --> 39:23.037
There actually wasn't even a complaint.

39:23.073 --> 39:26.174
Okay, well, so then how did
Lauren find out about it then?

39:27.244 --> 39:31.112
- Drew.
- Drew told Lauren.

39:31.147 --> 39:32.146
Why?

39:34.150 --> 39:35.984
Guess who they're
making interim principal.

39:41.024 --> 39:42.190
Thought you might be here.

39:44.127 --> 39:46.027
I can be pretty sporty, too.

39:49.532 --> 39:52.000
That's a good shot.

39:59.009 --> 40:01.376
Did... did you see me kiss Dawn?

40:08.318 --> 40:11.319
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Because...

40:14.291 --> 40:17.191
When Aaron kissed me,
it didn't mean anything.

40:17.227 --> 40:20.161
I was hoping that you felt the same way.

40:23.366 --> 40:25.099
Unless... did it?

40:29.105 --> 40:31.005
I... I shouldn't have kissed her...

40:31.041 --> 40:33.241
... and I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

40:36.046 --> 40:37.145
But did it mean something?

40:39.482 --> 40:40.982
Do you like her?

40:44.087 --> 40:45.119
Yeah.

40:47.390 --> 40:48.356
I like her.

40:51.227 --> 40:52.327
It's easy with her.

40:58.435 --> 41:00.101
I love you, Callie.

41:02.105 --> 41:05.006
But... everything is so damn hard.
