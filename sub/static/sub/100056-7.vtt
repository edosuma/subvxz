WEBVTT

00:01.227 --> 00:03.963
So the cardiac stress test
shows a large perfusion defect,

00:03.964 --> 00:05.188
which means the patient needs

00:05.189 --> 00:07.075
an angiogram and a cardiology consult.

00:07.076 --> 00:09.411
Excellent job, Dr. Kenney.

00:09.412 --> 00:10.736
I'm impressed.

00:10.737 --> 00:12.480
You were prepared, focused

00:12.481 --> 00:14.416
and clean.

00:15.985 --> 00:18.420
You three, however, were a disgrace.

00:18.421 --> 00:20.422
Tomorrow at rounds, I
want to see a higher level

00:20.423 --> 00:22.757
of professionalism, preparation and...

00:22.758 --> 00:25.593
I cannot stress this
enough... basic hygiene.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.465
Did you see the look Dr. Jacobs gave me

00:30.466 --> 00:32.567
when I mispronounced "thrombocytopenia"?

00:32.567 --> 00:34.903
It's the look she normally gives Carol.

00:36.272 --> 00:38.640
You? How about when I
said "arthrocentesis"

00:38.641 --> 00:42.410
instead of "paracentesis"
like a four-year-old?

00:42.411 --> 00:45.101
I'm sorry, am I hallucinating
because I haven't slept

00:45.102 --> 00:47.582
in two days, or are there teddy
bears dancing on your scrubs?

00:47.583 --> 00:49.806
I haven't had time to wash mine

00:49.807 --> 00:51.286
so I stole these from Pediatrics.

00:51.287 --> 00:52.921
Oh, I like them.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.189
Look, they're having a picnic.

00:54.190 --> 00:57.826
Oh! That one's got
his hand stuck in a jam jar.

00:57.827 --> 01:00.933
Carol, how is it that you
just killed it on rounds,

01:00.934 --> 01:02.597
and you don't even
seem a little bit tired?

01:02.598 --> 01:04.718
If you're on drugs, you
should really buy enough

01:04.718 --> 01:05.800
to share with the group.

01:05.801 --> 01:07.793
I'm not taking anything.

01:07.794 --> 01:09.571
Oh, except my daily Centrum Silver.

01:09.572 --> 01:12.207
You guys are welcome to try
them, but I have to warn you,

01:12.208 --> 01:13.775
it's a big hit of calcium.

01:13.776 --> 01:17.278
Does being short require less energy?

01:17.279 --> 01:19.047
No.

01:19.048 --> 01:21.783
The sleep deprivation
thing just isn't new to me.

01:21.784 --> 01:23.518
I was a working mom with two babies,

01:23.519 --> 01:26.154
then two toddlers, then two
children, then two teenagers.

01:26.155 --> 01:28.490
You had eight kids?

01:28.491 --> 01:30.482
Sorry, I'm so tired.

01:30.483 --> 01:32.992
You know, if you guys want,
I can help you figure out

01:32.993 --> 01:35.030
a better work-life balance.

01:35.031 --> 01:37.565
I'd just like to find
time to take a real shower.

01:39.035 --> 01:41.503
You know, helping you
guys is helping me,

01:41.504 --> 01:45.057
'cause your deterioration has
begun to spread to the lounge.

01:45.058 --> 01:46.574
What are you talking about?

01:48.978 --> 01:50.245
That's what I'm talking about.

01:50.246 --> 01:53.248
Could we burn this one
down and start over?

01:57.141 --> 02:00.165
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

02:02.727 --> 02:04.985
Okay, to get your lives back on track,

02:04.986 --> 02:07.121
we're gonna work together to clean up,

02:07.122 --> 02:08.521
like a family.

02:08.523 --> 02:10.315
Can I be the dad that
goes out for cigarettes

02:10.316 --> 02:12.874
and never comes back?

02:12.875 --> 02:15.960
So your solution to us being
overworked is more work?

02:15.961 --> 02:18.329
Yeah, is this some Karate
Kid, wax on, wax off thing?

02:18.330 --> 02:19.764
I am not waxing anything.

02:19.765 --> 02:23.634
I didn't do it for my ex,
and I'm not doing it for you.

02:23.635 --> 02:26.571
Okay, fine. Don't accept my help.

02:26.572 --> 02:28.973
Just keep wallowing in your
filth and messing up rounds,

02:28.974 --> 02:31.462
and someday I'll call you
when I need a chiropractor.

02:31.463 --> 02:34.098
No! I'm too pretty to be a chiropractor.

02:34.099 --> 02:36.601
- Tell us what to do.
- That's the spirit.

02:36.602 --> 02:39.920
Look, once the kitchen is
clean, we can eat healthier.

02:39.921 --> 02:42.873
Once the couch is free of old
banana peels, we can nap on it.

02:42.874 --> 02:45.376
Once our books don't stick
to the table, we can...

02:45.377 --> 02:46.944
Nap on it!

02:46.945 --> 02:48.279
Study on it.

02:49.172 --> 02:50.596
Maybe it won't be that much work.

02:50.597 --> 02:52.752
I mean, it's not so bad in here.

02:52.753 --> 02:54.020
Hey, Mom, I brought you some...

02:54.021 --> 02:56.022
Oh, my God, what is that?

02:56.023 --> 02:58.691
Did someone microwave fish,

02:58.692 --> 03:01.727
then microwave broccoli, then die?

03:01.728 --> 03:03.596
Maybe.

03:03.597 --> 03:06.866
We're not in here every
second of the day, Jenny.

03:06.867 --> 03:09.437
Wow. Okay, I have a big
meeting with Dr. Frost today,

03:09.438 --> 03:11.103
and I do not want this smell on me.

03:12.536 --> 03:14.170
Seriously, guys,

03:14.171 --> 03:15.931
it's the kind of smell
that could come alive.

03:17.107 --> 03:18.674
It has a weight to it.

03:18.675 --> 03:21.043
- Yep, we're in.
- Great.

03:21.044 --> 03:22.512
It's simple. If you see something

03:22.513 --> 03:24.451
that needs doing, do it.

03:24.452 --> 03:27.454
For instance, I will start
with replacing this thing.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:36.627 --> 03:38.795
Caleb will start by
replacing this thing.

03:40.731 --> 03:41.998
Oh.

03:41.999 --> 03:43.699
Dennis, I need to be pumped up today.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.835
Do you still have that
inspirational quotes calendar?

03:45.836 --> 03:48.204
Shh. You know I don't
like people to know

03:48.205 --> 03:50.039
I have a softer side.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.742
"Though we cannot control the wind,

03:52.743 --> 03:55.411
we can adjust our sails
as to use it wisely".

03:55.412 --> 03:57.346
What am I supposed to do with that?

03:58.415 --> 04:00.082
What am I, a sea captain?

04:00.083 --> 04:03.886
Apply yourself and you can
be anything you want to be.

04:03.887 --> 04:05.321
That was from yesterday.

04:08.358 --> 04:11.160
I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous.

04:11.161 --> 04:13.095
I'm pitching drugs to Dr. Frost today.

04:13.096 --> 04:14.931
He's the only doctor in this hospital

04:14.932 --> 04:17.033
I've never been able to sell to.

04:17.034 --> 04:19.101
He's my Red Lobster.

04:19.101 --> 04:21.370
You mean white whale?

04:21.370 --> 04:24.841
No, I mean Red Lobster.

04:24.842 --> 04:27.844
I've always wanted to go
there, but I can never find one.

04:27.845 --> 04:32.281
Well, he just thinks pharma reps
are a bad influence on medicine.

04:32.282 --> 04:34.884
You know, because of
the bribes and sexiness.

04:34.885 --> 04:37.253
Uh, that is so unfair.

04:37.254 --> 04:39.956
I mean, sure, some pharma
reps are all about bribes,

04:39.957 --> 04:43.392
but I'm about honesty and patient care.

04:43.393 --> 04:46.195
I can't help with the
sexiness; it's who I am.

04:47.231 --> 04:49.131
Same.

04:51.902 --> 04:54.065
Wow. This is looking better already.

04:54.066 --> 04:55.591
Look, we can see the couch.

04:55.592 --> 04:58.074
Remember the couch?

04:58.075 --> 05:00.109
And I got the TV remote to work again.

05:00.110 --> 05:05.248
Who knew grape jelly and Cheeto
dust could form such a paste?

05:05.249 --> 05:07.950
It's the human hair
that really binds it.

05:09.586 --> 05:13.155
Well, we're working together
and our lives are improving.

05:13.156 --> 05:15.450
Well, your lives are improving.

05:15.451 --> 05:17.493
I don't want to say it's
because of me, but...

05:17.494 --> 05:18.895
Carol, of course it's because of you.

05:18.896 --> 05:20.730
Your words, not mine.

05:20.731 --> 05:22.765
No, no, no, no, no! Don't go in there.

05:22.766 --> 05:25.067
I had some hummus the other day.

05:25.068 --> 05:27.069
Turned out to be really old yogurt.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.106
And there are mushrooms in there,

05:30.107 --> 05:32.775
but no one bought mushrooms.

05:32.776 --> 05:34.777
But I'm hungry.

05:34.778 --> 05:37.480
Ah, it's hard to be a
good vegan in a hospital.

05:37.481 --> 05:39.815
Actually, it's hard to
be a good vegan anywhere.

05:39.816 --> 05:41.417
That's what makes it so admirable.

05:41.418 --> 05:43.310
Oh.

05:43.311 --> 05:45.821
I got to take my tri-gem
patient to get an MRI in ten.

05:45.822 --> 05:47.590
Uh, I can start
cleaning the fridge or...

05:47.591 --> 05:49.258
Look, I'll take care of this.

05:49.259 --> 05:50.526
You use that extra ten minutes

05:50.527 --> 05:51.827
to get yourself
something healthy to eat.

05:51.828 --> 05:53.529
You cannot doctor on an empty stomach.

05:53.530 --> 05:55.498
So much gratefulness, Carol.

05:55.499 --> 05:57.739
A Matcha, Camu Camu,
Ashwagandha smoothie

05:57.740 --> 06:00.136
sounds so good right now.

06:00.137 --> 06:01.837
So much you're welcome-ness.

06:01.838 --> 06:03.372
Go drink your weird juice.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.310
Hey, Lexie, is my clipboard over there?

06:07.311 --> 06:09.211
I need to write out my patient notes.

06:09.212 --> 06:10.546
Lexie?

06:12.015 --> 06:14.517
Okay. I will finish this,

06:14.518 --> 06:16.319
and you just take a little nap.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.955
Aw, thanks, Carol. You're my hero.

06:18.956 --> 06:20.389
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:20.390 --> 06:24.894
The real heroes are mothers,
teachers and doctors.

06:24.895 --> 06:27.897
My, my, my.

06:27.898 --> 06:29.532
Guess I'm a triple threat.

06:29.533 --> 06:31.801
I'm also a triple threat.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.204
Looks, brains... looks.

06:37.240 --> 06:41.077
Daniel, there's a sink full
of dishes with your name on it.

06:41.078 --> 06:44.213
My patient with a bowel
obstruction just threw up on me.

06:44.214 --> 06:47.149
Is it too gross to wash
this with the dishes?

06:47.150 --> 06:49.251
I'll do the dishes. You go shower.

06:49.252 --> 06:51.044
Thanks, Carol. You're the best.

06:51.045 --> 06:53.155
Oh, if you say so.

06:53.156 --> 06:56.058
I'm just sharing some
hard-earned wisdom.

06:56.059 --> 07:00.162
Wisdom learned as a mother,
a teacher and a doctor.

07:01.565 --> 07:03.566
Okay, fridge.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.434
Let's dance.

07:06.503 --> 07:08.204
All right, Jennifer.

07:08.205 --> 07:12.008
Our quarterly tête-à-tête
is upon us again.

07:12.009 --> 07:14.343
I'm confident there's
nothing you're pitching

07:14.344 --> 07:16.112
I'm willing to prescribe,

07:16.113 --> 07:18.714
but I look forward to watching you try.

07:20.283 --> 07:22.752
I have an effective new
topical treatment for psoriasis

07:22.753 --> 07:24.420
that people are really talking about.

07:24.421 --> 07:26.856
Mostly people with psoriasis.

07:28.959 --> 07:31.560
I see this is a cream.

07:31.561 --> 07:34.296
You know I prefer a gel.

07:34.297 --> 07:35.464
I do.

07:35.465 --> 07:37.466
It also comes in a gel.

07:40.270 --> 07:43.239
Touché, Ms. Kenney.

07:43.240 --> 07:47.710
However, this supposed gel
appears to be oil-based,

07:47.711 --> 07:49.945
which technically makes it an ointment.

07:51.048 --> 07:53.916
And you know how I feel about ointment.

07:53.917 --> 07:57.319
It rhymes with "disappointment".

07:57.320 --> 07:58.554
Precisely.

07:58.555 --> 08:01.157
Oh, I do hope that's not all you have.

08:01.158 --> 08:03.286
I've found this less of a tête-à-tête

08:03.287 --> 08:05.561
and more of a tête-à-nyet.

08:05.562 --> 08:07.930
Of course that's not all I have.

08:07.931 --> 08:09.932
That was just the opening gambit.

08:09.933 --> 08:13.335
This is my end game.

08:13.336 --> 08:16.313
This is a cholesterol
medication I already prescribe.

08:16.314 --> 08:17.907
Mm, precisely.

08:17.908 --> 08:20.076
It's proven effective and now comes in

08:20.077 --> 08:22.912
this extended release formula.

08:24.915 --> 08:27.583
That is intriguing.

08:29.419 --> 08:32.421
However...

08:32.422 --> 08:35.057
the current formulation we
have is working just fine.

08:35.058 --> 08:36.826
But what if you could
do better than just fine?

08:36.827 --> 08:39.628
Jennifer, I admire your chutzpah,

08:39.629 --> 08:41.197
but we have different motivations.

08:41.198 --> 08:43.198
Yours is to push your products.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.334
Mine is to serve my patients and staff.

08:46.369 --> 08:48.704
Ah, would you look at that.

08:48.705 --> 08:50.172
The lungs have arrived.

08:53.009 --> 08:55.544
Caleb, next patient on
rounds: room 419. Symptoms?

08:55.545 --> 08:57.279
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.981
- Diagnosis?
- Acute pancreatitis.

08:58.982 --> 09:00.149
Confirmed by history of smoking.

09:00.150 --> 09:01.712
- Treatment?
- Begin with fluids

09:01.713 --> 09:04.353
and monitor for cholecystectomy, baby.

09:04.354 --> 09:06.386
Oh, are you guys prepping for rounds?

09:06.387 --> 09:08.691
I was just about to do that.
You sound sharp.

09:08.692 --> 09:11.193
We just finished. It is
amazing what sleep can do.

09:11.194 --> 09:12.228
And being clean.

09:12.229 --> 09:13.462
I love being clean.

09:13.463 --> 09:14.997
And washing with water.

09:14.998 --> 09:17.333
Hand sanitizer really burns in places.

09:17.334 --> 09:20.402
Plus, we're using the "Carol
study method" you taught us.

09:20.403 --> 09:22.171
Oh, I see that.

09:22.172 --> 09:24.907
I like the look of those
color-coded note cards.

09:24.908 --> 09:26.375
I use it all the time,

09:26.376 --> 09:28.589
for studying, lesson
planning, scheduling.

09:28.590 --> 09:30.045
You know, back when I was a teacher,

09:30.046 --> 09:32.672
the principal accused me of having OCD.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.827
And I said, "Organized Carol Disorder?

09:34.828 --> 09:36.585
I'll take it!"

09:36.586 --> 09:37.686
Carol, don't open that.

09:37.687 --> 09:38.808
It's okay.

09:38.809 --> 09:41.357
I stayed after a few hours
last night cleaning it.

09:41.358 --> 09:43.726
The great news is I was ready
when the grocery store opened

09:43.727 --> 09:46.067
'cause I got up super
early to learn more about

09:46.068 --> 09:48.564
hemoglobinopathies for
my thalassemia patient.

09:48.565 --> 09:51.433
It's a blood disorder, so guess
what color note cards I used.

09:51.434 --> 09:52.701
Blue!

09:52.702 --> 09:53.702
Ha. Gotcha.

09:55.739 --> 09:57.907
Carol, you have a little
coffee this morning?

09:57.908 --> 09:59.708
Maybe a pot or three.

09:59.709 --> 10:02.344
- So that's your secret.
- Well, that's part of it,

10:02.345 --> 10:04.680
but it's really about
effective time management,

10:04.681 --> 10:06.015
which I am modeling for you.

10:06.016 --> 10:07.283
For instance,

10:07.284 --> 10:09.070
I've allotted one hour this morning

10:09.071 --> 10:10.729
to study up on my new
patients for rounds,

10:10.730 --> 10:12.521
right after I finish
unloading the groceries.

10:12.522 --> 10:14.390
Rounds. Let's move.

10:14.391 --> 10:15.758
I-I thought rounds were at 8:00.

10:15.759 --> 10:17.259
406 coded and went to surgery.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.895
We got two new admits to
the ER, so now they're now.

10:19.896 --> 10:21.230
Does that work for
your schedule, Doctor?

10:21.231 --> 10:23.232
Yes, of course. I just
thought I'd have more time.

10:23.233 --> 10:25.234
So did 406.

10:25.235 --> 10:27.417
Okay, well, I'm starting to crash,

10:27.418 --> 10:28.771
so I'm just gonna get a cup of coffee.

10:28.772 --> 10:30.272
- Now.
- Okay.

10:32.576 --> 10:35.277
Blood work, sputum culture
and chest X-ray all confirm

10:35.278 --> 10:37.780
the diagnosis of community
acquired pneumonia.

10:37.781 --> 10:39.148
The recommended course of treatment is

10:39.149 --> 10:41.298
empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

10:41.299 --> 10:43.385
Excellent work.

10:43.386 --> 10:45.387
You three have certainly stepped it up,

10:45.388 --> 10:47.423
both in medicine and odor.

10:49.059 --> 10:50.426
Dr. Kenney, your patient.

10:50.427 --> 10:53.229
Uh, yes.

10:53.230 --> 10:56.498
Well, um, as you can see, uh,

10:56.499 --> 11:00.736
this patient presents as, uh, male.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.573
Um...

11:04.574 --> 11:07.076
Now, you'll all notice that his illness

11:07.077 --> 11:10.746
is not visible to the naked eye.

11:10.747 --> 11:12.581
And that's why they call us internists,

11:12.582 --> 11:15.317
Because the medicine is inside.

11:16.519 --> 11:19.521
Let's skip past the definition
of internal medicine.

11:19.522 --> 11:21.190
That's smart. Yeah, okay.

11:21.191 --> 11:23.493
Um, you know what?

11:23.494 --> 11:26.019
I am not gonna "doctor-splain"
this patient's illness to him.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.429
Sir, why don't you just fill us in.

11:27.430 --> 11:29.632
Me?

11:29.633 --> 11:34.270
Yeah. Just take ownership of
your health care experience.

11:34.271 --> 11:35.604
Well, um,

11:35.605 --> 11:39.008
I had a... hemorrhoid,

11:39.009 --> 11:40.476
and it burst.

11:40.477 --> 11:42.444
Then it got infected

11:42.445 --> 11:44.480
because I didn't get it looked at,

11:44.481 --> 11:46.882
because I was too
embarrassed to talk about it.

11:48.184 --> 11:49.685
Right. Hemorrhoid Henry.

11:49.686 --> 11:51.987
Dr. Kenney!

11:51.988 --> 11:55.357
Um, oh, the-the blood
panel revealed leukocytosis,

11:55.358 --> 11:57.393
indicating an infection and...

11:57.394 --> 11:59.328
Enough, Dr. Kenney.

11:59.329 --> 12:00.996
Dr. Kutcher?

12:00.997 --> 12:03.399
Recommended course of treatment
for his perirectal abscess

12:03.400 --> 12:06.368
is ciprofloxacin, a sitz
bath and a topical steroid.

12:06.369 --> 12:10.806
Dr. Kutcher, this is now your patient.

12:10.807 --> 12:13.042
W-Wait. I-I know this case.

12:13.043 --> 12:16.812
I-I didn't just... I didn't
have a chance to review.

12:21.017 --> 12:24.486
I am so sorry I called
you Hemorrhoid Henry.

12:24.487 --> 12:26.588
It's a mnemonic device.

12:26.589 --> 12:29.992
I'd like to go to a different hospital.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.552
Oh, sweet. Mile High Crew is on.

12:36.553 --> 12:38.474
It's this reality show
about flight crew members

12:38.475 --> 12:39.755
who hook up on a private jet.

12:39.756 --> 12:41.490
Oh, that's disgusting.

12:41.491 --> 12:44.994
Flying private is terrible
for the environment.

12:44.995 --> 12:46.895
This show's so stupid.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.131
I love it.

12:49.132 --> 12:51.954
Looks like the trays
aren't the only things

12:51.955 --> 12:53.435
in the upright position.

12:55.062 --> 12:57.104
Okay, guys, guys, can
you turn that down?

12:57.105 --> 12:59.006
If you remember,
I had a patient taken away.

12:59.007 --> 13:00.053
I need to review.

13:00.054 --> 13:02.144
Just a little treat
since we crushed it today.

13:02.145 --> 13:04.780
Oh, sorry. I mean, "we".

13:04.781 --> 13:08.380
Oh, but thanks again, Carol.
We were rested and sharp.

13:08.381 --> 13:11.149
It was like, "Foom-foom-foom!
Doctor-doctor-doctor!"

13:12.022 --> 13:15.090
Again, I'm glad you did
well, but I have to work.

13:15.091 --> 13:16.944
How could I forget hemorrhoids?

13:16.945 --> 13:19.295
I've had them.

13:19.296 --> 13:21.597
Ew.

13:23.199 --> 13:25.801
Why are you eating junk
from the vending machine?

13:25.802 --> 13:28.270
I just stocked the fridge
with healthy groceries.

13:28.271 --> 13:30.439
That peanut butter you
bought is all oily on top.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.642
So stir it.

13:33.643 --> 13:35.711
That seems like a whole thing.

13:38.648 --> 13:40.883
Can you all just please keep it down?

13:40.884 --> 13:43.118
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

13:43.119 --> 13:45.778
Angelique is in the galley.

13:45.779 --> 13:48.490
Oh, but Boris is also in the galley.

13:48.491 --> 13:51.894
Boris is also in the galley.

13:51.895 --> 13:53.896
Oh... !

13:53.897 --> 13:56.565
- No!
- Okay, that's it! I've had it!

13:56.566 --> 13:57.966
Whoa, what is up her butt?

13:57.967 --> 13:59.301
Hemorrhoids, apparently.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.906
What is up my butt?

14:03.907 --> 14:05.998
I will tell you what's up my butt.

14:05.999 --> 14:08.293
I made a fool of myself

14:08.294 --> 14:11.517
on rounds because I spent
the entire day helping you.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.495
And here you are, eating junk food

14:13.496 --> 14:15.217
and watching soft-core porn.

14:15.218 --> 14:18.320
I'm the only one who
does anything around here.

14:18.321 --> 14:20.322
I give and give and give,

14:20.323 --> 14:21.824
and you take and take and take.

14:21.825 --> 14:23.525
And you don't even do me the courtesy

14:23.526 --> 14:26.319
of shutting up for five minutes!

14:26.320 --> 14:29.031
So here's what's going to happen.

14:29.032 --> 14:30.632
No more TV!

14:34.003 --> 14:36.171
You just unplugged the coffee maker.

14:36.172 --> 14:38.374
Damn it!

14:38.375 --> 14:41.577
No more coffee or TV!

14:41.578 --> 14:43.746
And you won't get any
more coffee or TV until...

14:43.747 --> 14:45.748
Um, Mom, I heard
yelling. What is going on?

14:45.749 --> 14:48.751
Jenny, I am so glad
you are here to witness

14:48.752 --> 14:50.919
this parade of

14:50.920 --> 14:53.856
lazy... filth people!

14:55.440 --> 14:57.565
Mom, come with me.

14:57.566 --> 15:00.001
You can tell me all about
the lazy filth people.

15:02.265 --> 15:04.733
What did you do to her?

15:08.446 --> 15:10.038
I cleaned that lounge,

15:10.039 --> 15:11.863
I helped them with
their work-life balance,

15:11.864 --> 15:13.726
and all they did was eat junk food

15:13.727 --> 15:15.277
and giggle at the word "cockpit".

15:16.780 --> 15:18.313
Sorry.

15:18.314 --> 15:19.548
But come on.

15:19.549 --> 15:21.441
They knew it when they named it.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.644
Can we focus?

15:23.645 --> 15:25.136
We can.

15:25.137 --> 15:27.656
Just help me understand
what we're focusing on.

15:27.657 --> 15:29.625
Did they ask you for help?

15:29.626 --> 15:31.806
No, I offered.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.580
But I had to. Those kids
can't take care of themselves.

15:34.581 --> 15:37.116
Their lives were
falling apart without me.

15:37.117 --> 15:38.751
But I can't do everything for them.

15:38.752 --> 15:40.385
I mean, what am I, their mother?

15:40.386 --> 15:42.654
Kind of sounds like it.

15:42.655 --> 15:45.124
And it kind of sounds like
it's affecting your work.

15:45.125 --> 15:48.560
Okay. Maybe I have been
taking on more than I need to,

15:48.561 --> 15:50.262
but I've always taken on a lot,

15:50.263 --> 15:52.397
and I've never struggled
like this before.

15:52.398 --> 15:54.299
But you've never been a doctor before.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.968
Being a high school science teacher

15:55.969 --> 15:57.102
isn't quite as demanding.

15:57.103 --> 15:58.637
I don't care what anyone says.

15:58.638 --> 16:00.172
Teaching the sexual reproduction cycle

16:00.173 --> 16:01.673
to a bunch of hormonal 14-year-olds

16:01.674 --> 16:04.643
is the hardest thing that anyone can do.

16:06.746 --> 16:08.781
But you have a point.

16:08.782 --> 16:11.817
And I know your interns
seem young and helpless,

16:11.818 --> 16:14.520
but they're not your
kids or your students.

16:14.521 --> 16:15.921
They're your peers.

16:15.922 --> 16:17.589
Yesterday, one of my peers

16:17.590 --> 16:20.759
had his shirt tucked
into his underpants.

16:20.760 --> 16:24.696
Everyone learns at their own pace.

16:24.697 --> 16:26.465
They're not your responsibility.

16:26.466 --> 16:30.169
Okay, I'll stop mom-ing my coworkers.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.438
But I can't stop cold
turkey, so just give me a fix.

16:33.439 --> 16:35.007
How was your day, sweetie?

16:35.008 --> 16:37.009
Not great.

16:37.010 --> 16:40.179
I just don't think I'll
ever sell to Dr. Frost.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.504
He doesn't take me seriously.

16:41.505 --> 16:42.881
Oh, don't take that personally.

16:42.882 --> 16:44.550
He's a doctors' doctor.

16:44.551 --> 16:47.286
He only listens to other
medical professionals.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.989
That's exactly right.

16:50.990 --> 16:52.658
Thank you. I got to go.

16:52.659 --> 16:54.526
Wait, is that it? Do you need money?

16:54.527 --> 16:57.529
Do you have a sweater?
I'm so proud of you, honey!

17:00.300 --> 17:03.635
Dr. Frost, I'm leaving to
see Dr. Cooke at St. Francis.

17:03.636 --> 17:05.369
Last chance to order my cholesterol med.

17:05.371 --> 17:07.372
No, thank you.

17:07.373 --> 17:10.209
Oh, tell ol' Cooke that his backhand

17:10.210 --> 17:12.211
is as frightening as his ponytail.

17:13.980 --> 17:16.048
I will not.

17:16.049 --> 17:18.916
But before I go, I do
have a few more questions.

17:18.917 --> 17:21.185
- Ask away.
- Not for you.

17:21.186 --> 17:23.188
Dennis, as a medical professional,

17:23.189 --> 17:24.556
how much of your day is spent

17:24.557 --> 17:26.692
administering medication to patients?

17:26.693 --> 17:27.726
Too much.

17:27.727 --> 17:29.161
And how much time is spent

17:29.162 --> 17:31.530
readministering that same
med because it's worn off?

17:31.531 --> 17:34.833
Oh, it cuts into my bathroom breaks.

17:34.834 --> 17:37.069
It's how I got that UTI.

17:38.283 --> 17:39.950
That was a doozy.

17:40.974 --> 17:43.709
So what if I told you there's
an extended release option

17:43.710 --> 17:46.078
of your most popular
cholesterol medication?

17:46.079 --> 17:50.182
I'd say, uh, give it to me now.

17:50.183 --> 17:53.385
So a medication with a
longer duration of action

17:53.386 --> 17:56.521
would help both the nursing
staff and your patients.

17:56.522 --> 17:58.290
That is true.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.903
Hey, I-I'm not playing.

18:00.904 --> 18:05.499
You both make excellent points.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.900
Which, incidentally, is
what the two triangles

18:07.901 --> 18:10.936
said to each other.

18:10.937 --> 18:12.938
Jennifer...

18:15.375 --> 18:16.775
... check and mate.

18:16.776 --> 18:18.610
I will give it a chance.

18:18.611 --> 18:20.269
Thank you, Dr. Frost.

18:20.270 --> 18:21.828
Very impressive.

18:21.829 --> 18:24.816
You couldn't change the
direction of the wind,

18:24.817 --> 18:27.786
but you adjusted your
sails to use it wisely.

18:27.787 --> 18:31.089
You read the calendar, too?

18:32.125 --> 18:35.394
Jennifer, I wrote the calendar.

18:43.102 --> 18:45.604
Oh. There you are.

18:45.605 --> 18:47.572
Don't pull any cords around here.

18:47.573 --> 18:50.008
People could die.

18:50.009 --> 18:51.977
I want to apologize.

18:51.978 --> 18:53.779
I shouldn't have yelled

18:53.780 --> 18:57.816
and called you lazy filth people.

18:57.817 --> 19:01.820
That was hurtful but,
in retrospect, accurate.

19:01.821 --> 19:04.289
We didn't mean to take advantage of you.

19:04.290 --> 19:06.792
It was just nice being
taken care of for a second.

19:06.793 --> 19:08.493
You're a good mom.

19:08.494 --> 19:11.463
Oh. Well, old habits die hard.

19:11.464 --> 19:14.533
And like actual motherhood, it
got tiring and had consequences.

19:14.534 --> 19:17.302
We get it. You have hemorrhoids.

19:18.859 --> 19:21.273
Well, from now on,
my only responsibility

19:21.274 --> 19:22.774
is to my patients.

19:22.775 --> 19:25.110
Speaking of which, I
need to prep for rounds.

19:25.111 --> 19:28.313
Actually, uh, we made you
something to say sorry.

19:28.314 --> 19:29.314
What's this?

19:29.315 --> 19:30.782
We did your pre-rounds.

19:30.783 --> 19:33.852
You have a patient
with COPD exacerbation.

19:33.853 --> 19:36.321
Those cards have everything
you need to know about COPD.

19:36.322 --> 19:37.889
We left out the patient's gender though,

19:37.890 --> 19:40.325
'cause we know you're really
good at diagnosing that.

19:40.326 --> 19:41.626
Aw, thanks.

19:41.627 --> 19:44.062
And I know exactly how I'm
gonna use my extra time.

19:44.063 --> 19:46.131
Resetting the clock
on the coffee machine?

19:46.132 --> 19:48.133
No. I want to watch that show

19:48.134 --> 19:50.135
with all the dimwits on the airplane.

19:50.136 --> 19:52.004
I'm gonna need you guys
to walk me through it.

19:52.005 --> 19:55.574
Is everyone bisexual or just some?

19:55.575 --> 19:58.577
Oh, Carol. You've come
to the right place.

20:01.029 --> 20:02.053
Oh!

20:02.054 --> 20:03.984
