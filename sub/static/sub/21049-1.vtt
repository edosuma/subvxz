WEBVTT

00:16.308 --> 00:17.392
Wow.

00:19.728 --> 00:20.562
Pregnant?

00:25.400 --> 00:26.401
Okay.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.488
I'm sorry.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.409
I know this isn't the best time, but...

00:35.785 --> 00:36.828
I had to tell you.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.542
So... Merry Christmas, Colt.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.215
Is it... Is it just...

00:49.799 --> 00:50.925
You got morning sickness?

00:51.008 --> 00:54.637
[stammers] 'Cause I've thrown up
every day this week.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.725
I bought every pregnancy test
Walgreens had.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.605
Which was only four 'cause winter formal
was last week. [chuckles]

01:07.359 --> 01:09.611
You know that those things
aren't always accurate.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.155
[stammers] Did you go...
Did you see a doctor?

01:13.531 --> 01:16.493
Yeah. He said I was pregnant.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.498
You okay?

01:24.126 --> 01:25.793
I mean, I'm all right.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.338
A little overwhelmed.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.134
You're the first person I've told.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.054
Yeah, I'm glad you did.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.644
You know, I'm... I'm gonna need a drink.
Do you want something to drink?

01:43.978 --> 01:48.191
I don't know. I'm drivin',
and the roads are kind of icy, and...

01:48.275 --> 01:49.734
you know, I'm pregnant. [chuckles]

01:49.817 --> 01:51.111
-Shit.
-Colt?

01:51.194 --> 01:53.780
-Yeah?
-Isn't that your mom's Jeep comin' up?

01:54.739 --> 01:57.284
-You know, I should go.
-Yeah. Uh, no. No, no, it's fine.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.578
Just, uh... just don't act pregnant.

02:09.671 --> 02:10.713
[Beau sighs]

02:12.298 --> 02:14.008
I would have been okay to drive.

02:14.091 --> 02:18.095
Beau, you flipped off the guy who was
raising money for the Salvation Army.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.767
You don't get to be in the army
by ringing a fucking bell.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.438
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.
Merry Christmas.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.649
Hi, Heather. Happy holidays.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.025
"Happy holidays."

02:32.860 --> 02:37.073
Don't start that PC crap.
It's "Merry Christmas."

02:39.075 --> 02:40.535
[Heather chuckles]

02:40.618 --> 02:42.870
Hey, I have those Uggs, too.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.873
Don't you tell anyone. I love 'em.

02:48.210 --> 02:52.922
This is... weird.
Dad's coming home drunk and I'm sober.

02:54.257 --> 02:59.136
I'm not drunk. I'm festive.
It's fucking Christmas.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.890
[scoffs] Would you give me a hand?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.437
Honey, would you like to come inside?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.064
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm... I'm gonna wait out here.

03:10.147 --> 03:13.025
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Have a great holiday.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.197
Ding-a-ling-a-ling!
Look at me, I'm in the army!

03:19.407 --> 03:22.702
If anything,
it ought to be the Salvation Navy.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.204
Those guys are a bunch of pussies.

03:26.914 --> 03:28.541
-Dad, do you want a water?
-Yeah.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.586
Put some ice
and some Jim Beam in there, too.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.012
[Maggie] Hey, are you okay?

03:41.095 --> 03:44.724
-What's Heather doing here?
-Oh, uh...

03:44.807 --> 03:47.227
she left some presents here
for her nephew.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.395
Uh, so he wouldn't find them.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.104
Okay.

03:50.187 --> 03:52.774
Lie to your mother on Christmas.
It's fine.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.945
I hope, whatever it was,
you were done, 'cause she's leaving.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.282
Shit!

04:07.872 --> 04:09.874
[cell phone ringing]

04:17.257 --> 04:18.508
Hey, Ab.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.012
Yeah, yeah.
[stammers] No, I, uh...

04:24.221 --> 04:27.016
I got held up here.
I'll, uh... I'll be right there.

04:27.975 --> 04:30.186
Okay. Yeah.

04:31.103 --> 04:32.188
Bye.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.777
Fuck.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.407
[theme song playing]

05:42.925 --> 05:44.469
[Christmas music playing]

05:46.053 --> 05:49.015
[grunts] Okay,
finally got those kids asleep.

05:49.098 --> 05:52.352
Every year I say, "This time,
I am not using the cough syrup."

05:55.146 --> 05:56.022
Every year I do.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.527
Ah, well, what were the odds
Darlene's kids were gonna cure cancer?

06:02.069 --> 06:03.571
[laughing]

06:03.655 --> 06:06.198
Cure it? No, I'd be happy
if they could spell it.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.324
[Rooster chuckles]

06:08.451 --> 06:09.744
So, how was the rest of your night?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.748
Ah, it was all right. [sighs]
I don't know.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.084
Remember Christmas as a kid?
It was the best, you know.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.962
You got games and toys and...

06:20.046 --> 06:23.132
Uncle Billy gave you a couple of beers,
watched you run into shit.

06:25.427 --> 06:29.764
As an adult, all you get is underwear
and your family.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.476
Mmm, I've done your laundry.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.145
-Underwear's a good gift for you.
-[grunts]

06:37.980 --> 06:39.107
Did somethin' happen?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.193
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.863
Oh, by the way,
I stopped by the gas station.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.534
Got some stockin' stuffers
for Darlene's kids.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.705
Really? You didn't have to do that.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.290
And if you got my gift there,

06:56.373 --> 06:58.918
you can use the gas you bought
to get the fuck out of here.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.002
[chuckles]

07:00.920 --> 07:03.047
Relax, I got your present weeks ago.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.841
Bass Pro Shops.

07:07.677 --> 07:11.138
No, I just swung through
to grab a Big Gulp,

07:11.222 --> 07:14.308
and I made ten bucks buyin'
some cigarettes for some kids outside.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.312
The smile on their faces
reminded me of your grandkids.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.689
[chuckles]

07:20.607 --> 07:23.234
Stocking stuffers from the gas station...

07:23.818 --> 07:27.029
-I'm dreaming of a white trash Christmas.
-Mmm.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.323
-[chuckles]
-[door slams]

07:29.407 --> 07:32.410
If I see you again, I'll cut off your head
and they won't find it 'till spring

07:32.493 --> 07:35.413
when some coyote
is skull-fucking your eye socket!

07:36.038 --> 07:40.209
[laughs] All right.
Who's ready for church?

07:41.752 --> 07:42.879
Yeah, he's not comin'.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.548
Who? You talking that way to Santa?

07:47.383 --> 07:49.969
My ex, Jason. Deadbeat asshole.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.764
I said I wanted to get Luke a bike,
but he insisted he'd get it,

07:52.847 --> 07:55.517
and now it's Christmas Eve and nothin'.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.434
Well, perfect. Perfect!

07:57.519 --> 07:59.604
Tomorrow morning,
Luke's gonna come down to open up his gift

07:59.687 --> 08:01.397
and find a helmet and no bike.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.860
He's gonna think he's one of those kids
who needs to wear a helmet.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.865
-[fire crackling]
-[Christmas music playing]

08:15.036 --> 08:17.914
Well, nobody threw up.
Nobody got shot.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.667
It's a pretty damn good Christmas
for the Bennetts.

08:23.878 --> 08:28.049
This couch doesn't stop moving,
somebody is still liable to throw up.

08:30.552 --> 08:34.597
All I'm sayin' is, it was nice
to be with family on Christmas Eve.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.016
Yeah.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.269
Too bad it wasn't someone else's family.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.274
Look, I... I know it didn't turn out
the way you wanted, but...

08:45.357 --> 08:48.528
the way you reached out to Rooster,
that was really sweet.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.200
Can we not talk about it? It's over.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.078
I know he's bein' stubborn.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.582
Shouldn't come as a surprise,
he's a lot like you.

09:01.373 --> 09:03.500
He's nothin' like me.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.964
My father gave me that knife. I said,
"Thank you, sir," and shook his hand.

09:09.048 --> 09:13.553
Wow. You know, that's the warmest memory
you ever shared with me.

09:16.263 --> 09:17.264
And later that night,

09:17.348 --> 09:21.393
I stuck it through a possum's head
that was eatin' my mother's garden.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.812
[chuckles]

09:24.814 --> 09:29.652
Look, Rooster'll come around. Colt did.
Just be there to welcome him.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.489
[scoffs] Oh, I realize
I'm saying this to a man

09:33.573 --> 09:37.076
who once referred to Rudolph
as an affirmative action case.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.333
You know, first, Rooster doesn't
want to be part of this ranch.

09:44.416 --> 09:46.418
Now he doesn't want to be
part of this family.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.588
Fine by me.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.632
He'll come back. Colt did.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.841
Colt didn't come back.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.551
He was kicked out
of the rest of the world.

09:57.096 --> 10:01.017
Okay... I can see this is going nowhere.

10:02.143 --> 10:07.774
Think I'll just leave you alone so you
can be visited by your three ghosts.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.153
You know, it's late, Mags.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.405
Roads are a little icy.

10:15.447 --> 10:16.741
You could spend the night.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.576
[smacks   lips] Wow.

10:22.789 --> 10:27.001
You know, that move
hasn't changed in 40 years.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.546
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

10:32.589 --> 10:34.884
Beau, have you noticed? We're divorced.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.929
So, you're single.

10:42.599 --> 10:45.269
You know,
it's not that I wouldn't enjoy it.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.273
Just... I think we gotta stop doin' this.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.735
Otherwise, we'll never be able to move on.

10:53.319 --> 10:58.157
So, this is my new Christmas tradition.
Sittin' on the couch alone.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.785
You still have Colt.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.495
Please stop doing that.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.416
You gonna be all right
if I leave you here?

11:07.958 --> 11:10.086
-I'll be fine. [grunts]
-All right.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.049
Hey, Beau. Merry Christmas.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.593
Happy holidays.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.106
Abby... what are you doin'?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.900
Just getting some fresh air.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.487
Since when do you smoke?

11:36.570 --> 11:39.365
-Since my parents got here.
-What?

11:40.407 --> 11:42.034
I thought they were meetin' us
at midnight Mass.

11:42.118 --> 11:46.247
I know, but my dad wanted to stop by
and take a look at the furnace.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.917
-I just fixed your furnace.
-Yeah, that's why he wanted to stop by.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.712
This is the last thing I need right now.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.089
-Listen, don't be nervous.
-[grunts]

11:55.172 --> 11:57.591
All right?
Yeah, they don't like you.

11:57.674 --> 11:59.969
And, yeah, them talkin' about
how much they don't like you

12:00.052 --> 12:02.429
is the reason why
I'm on cigarette number four.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.974
And by the way,
I fuckin' love smokin'. [chuckles]

12:06.517 --> 12:09.061
Anyway, listen, I...
I told 'em that you're a different guy now

12:09.145 --> 12:11.773
and if they just give you a chance,
you'll surprise them.

12:13.024 --> 12:16.443
Yeah, I'm... full of surprises.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.448
Are you okay?

12:23.325 --> 12:24.911
Yeah.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.954
Yeah, I just... I, uh...

12:27.955 --> 12:30.541
-wasn't expectin' to see 'em so soon.
-[softly] Yeah.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.418
And now I've got to
come up with small talk here,

12:32.501 --> 12:34.670
and on the car ride to church and...

12:34.753 --> 12:36.964
If we just met 'em there,
I could just give them the handshake,

12:37.048 --> 12:39.258
and the nod,
and the "Peace be with you," be done.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.262
Colt, you're overreacting, all right?
They're just my parents.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.015
I know what'll make you feel better.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.142
-[sighs]
-Here.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.688
Yeah, I don't think a cigarette
is gonna make me feel better.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.148
Eh, just take a drag.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.110
Abby...

13:01.072 --> 13:03.074
-Fine.
-[chuckles]

13:08.162 --> 13:09.496
[exhales]

13:12.249 --> 13:14.543
-Holy shit.
-Right?

13:15.627 --> 13:17.504
-Let's go, Abby.
-[Abby clears throat]

13:19.841 --> 13:22.676
Oh, hello, Colt.
Glad you could finally make it.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.303
Mr. Phillips.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.807
Peace be with you.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.185
I'd love to shake your hand,

13:31.268 --> 13:35.064
but mine's a little dirty
after fixing the furnace. Correctly.

13:35.814 --> 13:36.815
[coughs]

13:38.985 --> 13:41.278
Oh, Colt, you're here.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.364
-And you smoke now.
-Oh.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.283
Mrs. Phillips, I, uh...

13:47.493 --> 13:49.996
That's a delightful sweater vest.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.623
Oh, thank you, Colt.

13:52.706 --> 13:56.127
I got one for Abby.
She says it "doesn't fit."

13:56.793 --> 13:58.712
Okay, you know what?
The cigarette was mine.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.132
Oh, great.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.218
No sweater and you smoke.
Merry Christmas, Janice.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.973
Look, if we could all exhale
before we get in my new Lincoln,

14:09.056 --> 14:10.474
that'd be great.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.477
All right, I'll grab my scarf
and we can go.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.686
You don't need your scarf.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.232
The MKX has heated seats.
That's the beauty of it.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.862
You go to church one day a year,
the least you could do is be on time.

14:22.945 --> 14:23.946
Oh, trust me.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.033
[stammers] If it were up to me,
we'd be goin' every week. But...

14:27.116 --> 14:28.617
but you know Abby. She's like,

14:28.700 --> 14:32.955
"I hate church.
I guess I'm just not as into God as you."

14:34.456 --> 14:36.876
You hear that, Chuck?
Now she hates God.

14:38.835 --> 14:41.338
How's everything going
at the John Deere dealership?

14:42.464 --> 14:43.632
Hey, you know, if, uh...

14:43.715 --> 14:48.888
if you ever need a retired football star
to do an ad for you, I know a guy.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.347
You know Peyton Manning?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.060
Yes.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.148
Mmm, great. Give him a call.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.900
Hey, I would, yeah.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.195
[stammers] But, he... I'm pretty sure
he's out fishing with, uh...

15:05.321 --> 15:06.738
Papa John.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.747
Mom, there's literally no store open
within 25 miles.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.624
Shit. Well, Merry Christmas, Luke.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.709
You're not gettin' a bike.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.796
Just strap on your helmet
and ride a cardboard box down the stairs.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.717
First of all, that's awesome.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.929
But if you want to get him somethin' else,

15:30.012 --> 15:33.474
the gun shop in Grand Junction's
open 24/7.

15:33.557 --> 15:37.394
Their motto is...
"The Second Amendment never sleeps."

15:38.645 --> 15:39.813
He's five.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.816
I didn't say give him ammo.
I'm not an idiot.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.071
They also got targets that look like
bin Laden. He can color it.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.576
[gasps]

15:53.535 --> 15:55.204
It's so pretty here.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.083
You and Kenny could have had
a beautiful wedding.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.584
Ma.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.837
That reminds me,
we're having dinner with him on Tuesday.

16:04.713 --> 16:08.550
Oh, y'all still hang out with Kenny.
That's... great.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.594
Dad just likes the pork chops
at the Marriott

16:10.677 --> 16:12.263
and Kenny always throws in
a free baked potato

16:12.346 --> 16:15.516
-and lets Mom play the piano in the lobby.
-[giggles]

16:16.183 --> 16:18.477
Hey, Colt!
Saved you guys seats.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.772
Yeah.

16:22.814 --> 16:25.942
Great. We'll all sit together.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.158
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.495
Mom, Dad, you remember Colt's mom, Maggie,
and his brother, Rooster?

16:36.578 --> 16:40.541
Oh. Janice, Chuck, it's nice to see you.
It's been too long.

16:40.624 --> 16:44.003
I know, I don't even remember
the last time we saw each other.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.798
As I recall,
Colt soaked a watermelon in Everclear

16:47.881 --> 16:50.467
and we had to pick up Abby
after she got her stomach pumped.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.969
[Rooster chuckles]

16:53.054 --> 16:55.931
All right.
Well, uh, peace be with you.

16:57.599 --> 17:01.062
Hey, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Phillips,
this is my girlfriend, Mary,

17:01.145 --> 17:02.896
and her daughter, Heather.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.942
-Jerky?
-Oh... No, thank you.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.154
I like to save my appetite
for the body of Christ.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.574
I'll take hers.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.083
Rooster. Rooster.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.002
What do you say we go light a candle
for Grandma Bennett?

17:27.088 --> 17:28.422
She died in a fire.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.468
Seems a little insensitive, but okay.

17:37.556 --> 17:41.227
So, uh, Janice,
how do you like living in Grand Junction?

17:41.310 --> 17:44.438
Oh, it's really exciting.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.899
We have an Indian restaurant
and a Thai place.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.193
Wow.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.444
I love the Thai place.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.240
They have a spiciness scale
from one to ten. I take a two.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.576
Unless I've had rosé,
and then I bump it up to a three.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.203
[chuckles]

17:59.286 --> 18:00.537
We enjoy it.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.582
They let Chuck bring in his Wendy's.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.339
-[grunts] What's up?
-All right.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.301
-You can't tell anyone.
-[scoffs] We shall see.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.845
-No, come on. I'm serious.
-[sniffles]

18:20.932 --> 18:23.310
-Heather's pregnant.
-Holy fuck!

18:24.895 --> 18:26.605
Do I love Jesus!

18:28.524 --> 18:29.608
Is she gonna keep it?

18:30.484 --> 18:31.610
Of course she is.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.529
I'm just saying, there's always an option.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.865
No, there's not.
That ain't happenin'. God.

18:36.948 --> 18:39.326
And don't talk about you-know-what
in front of you-know-who.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.245
Oh, right.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.288
The world's most famous
unplanned pregnancy.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.540
I'm sure he'll be fine with it.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.378
Damn. Did you tell Abby?

18:51.004 --> 18:51.839
Not yet.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.676
Can I? It'd be my Christmas gift.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.844
Will you knock it off, man?
I'm freaking out.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.763
Fine. I'm sorry. I get it.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.683
Look, I got your back, all right?

19:02.766 --> 19:04.810
You want to skip town?
I'll drive the car.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.646
You want to keep it?
I'll just, you know...

19:07.729 --> 19:10.566
teach the kid how to hunt
and throw a football

19:10.649 --> 19:12.776
and all the other shit you're terrible at.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.988
-Thanks.
-All right.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.032
[sighs] It's gonna be fine, all right?

19:19.115 --> 19:20.617
Look...

19:20.701 --> 19:23.245
world gets another Bennett.
Nothing wrong with that.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.581
[organ music playing]

19:25.664 --> 19:26.873
We should probably head back.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.500
-Yeah.
-[grunts]

19:29.710 --> 19:31.462
-Oh, hey, one more thing.
-[sniffles]

19:31.545 --> 19:33.380
I'm gonna call you later tonight.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.508
I need you to pretend to be
either Peyton Manning or Papa John.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.387
Not a problem.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.315
[whispering] Mary.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.193
Mary.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.446
-Mary!
-I'll cut you, bitch!

19:57.529 --> 19:59.281
-[chuckles]
-Oh, shit. Sorry.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.574
Easy, it's me.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.494
-You havin' that prison dream again?
-No, family reunion.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.789
[sighs] To be fair, we did all end up
in jail that night anyway.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.916
What are you doing here?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.501
Well... [grunts]

20:11.585 --> 20:13.712
I got Luke his Christmas present.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.299
-Oh, my God! Are you kidding?
-[sighs]

20:17.383 --> 20:20.010
Look, if Luke thinks
he's gettin' a bike for Christmas,

20:20.093 --> 20:21.762
he's gettin' a bike for Christmas.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.850
I have never seen you so sensitive.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.520
-It's kind of sexy.
-[chuckles]

20:29.603 --> 20:31.688
-Really? Mmm.
-Mmm.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.691
What time you think
the kids are gettin' up?

20:35.275 --> 20:38.028
Baby, when those kids come downstairs,
they want to see presents.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.697
They don't want to see their grandma
gettin' railed on the couch.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.117
Fine, but you owe me one orgasm.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.328
Mmm, you owe me ten.

20:47.579 --> 20:51.250
Seriously, this   is so sweet.
Luke is gonna lose his mind.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.586
Where did you find a bike in the
middle of the night on Christmas Eve?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.922
[clicks tongue] You really want to know?

20:57.005 --> 20:58.882
Because I'll tell you
if you really want to know.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.055
No, just, uh, take the license plate
that says "Kyle" off the back.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.768
Have fun with your helmet tomorrow, Kyle.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.407
What are you doin' up so early?

21:24.616 --> 21:26.910
I was feedin' cattle
while you were sleepin' in.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.749
-You did that on Christmas mornin'?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

21:32.833 --> 21:35.419
Well, the cows don't know it's Christmas.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.340
Sounds like somethin' I'd say.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.675
Yeah, you do.
Every Christmas.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.723
I got a little somethin' for you.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.938
[chuckles]

21:59.485 --> 22:00.527
A book?

22:03.905 --> 22:06.492
Dad, I'm not sure you know me so well.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.995
-Just open it.
-[chuckles]

22:17.168 --> 22:19.796
It's, like, every article
ever written about me.

22:20.756 --> 22:25.343
Yeah, well... I figure I got a lot more
Christmases behind me

22:25.427 --> 22:27.429
than I do in front of me, so...

22:28.430 --> 22:29.765
there you are.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.935
How long you been workin' on this?

22:34.686 --> 22:35.520
I mean, it's just...

22:37.188 --> 22:38.524
really unexpected.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.067
It's just glue and newspapers.

22:43.069 --> 22:45.321
And little football stickers.

22:47.365 --> 22:50.118
-You want the fuckin' thing or not?
-[both chuckle]

22:52.913 --> 22:56.500
"Colt Bennett:
Pop Warner Player of the Year."

22:57.375 --> 22:59.878
"Bennett Leads Mustangs
to State Championship."

23:02.338 --> 23:05.884
"Local Star Recruited
by Florida State." [chuckles]

23:07.719 --> 23:10.556
"Local Star Gets Tased
by Florida State Trooper."

23:15.060 --> 23:16.687
Stop there. [chuckles]

23:19.272 --> 23:20.273
Thank you.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.818
Merry Christmas.

23:25.654 --> 23:30.075
Look, I don't like talkin' to people
about their personal lives.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.537
I don't like talkin' to people at all.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.416
But I got to say somethin'.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.587
Abby and Heather
are both fine young women

23:41.670 --> 23:44.422
who deserve to be treated with respect.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.050
Okay.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.138
Not sure what you're gettin' at there.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.600
What was Heather doin' here last night?

23:54.683 --> 23:59.646
[stammers] Oh. No, no, no.
I'm... I'm not cheatin' on Abby.

23:59.730 --> 24:02.190
All right, good.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.820
Heather's pregnant.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.617
It's mine.

24:17.247 --> 24:20.083
This is why
I don't like talkin' to people.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.716
So... what's the plan?

24:32.053 --> 24:33.179
I don't have one.

24:40.395 --> 24:43.899
Last night, I...
I was gonna propose to Abby.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.069
I mean, that's always been the plan
since I was 15.

24:48.153 --> 24:52.533
I was gonna win a Super Bowl,
marry Abby and then buy a sweet Jet Ski.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.872
-Son, you--
-Look, I...

24:58.955 --> 25:02.083
I get that
my football dreams are gone, but...

25:03.501 --> 25:04.878
I got back with Abby.

25:06.212 --> 25:07.964
So, it's like everything was on track.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.135
But... now what?
What am I supposed to do?

25:12.218 --> 25:13.970
[stammers] Do I...

25:15.055 --> 25:17.766
forget about Abby and go be with Heather?

25:17.849 --> 25:21.562
Or do I stay with Abby
while Heather's having my kid?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.398
I can't answer that question, Colt.

25:25.481 --> 25:27.901
Fuck! That's the same thing Siri said.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.866
I can't answer it because
you're askin' the wrong question.

25:35.992 --> 25:36.993
[Colt sighs]

25:37.077 --> 25:38.912
You're thinkin' about what's best for you.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.498
But you're gonna be a father now.

25:44.459 --> 25:46.587
From this day forward,
for the rest of your life,

25:46.670 --> 25:49.631
all that matters is
what's best for that kid.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.218
Like right now...

25:53.844 --> 25:56.597
I'd like to be watching the Aloha Bowl.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.606
Instead, I'm stuck here, helpin' you.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.154
I'm not ready for this.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.323
Nobody's ready.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.243
I got shipped off to war.

26:18.326 --> 26:21.747
I got handed a ranch
without knowin' how to run it.

26:23.874 --> 26:28.086
But I was more scared
when I found out I was gonna be a father.

26:31.047 --> 26:34.801
I think you're gonna surprise yourself
with how ready you are.

26:37.595 --> 26:38.930
[Colt sniffles]

26:41.808 --> 26:43.434
[sniffles] Thanks, Dad.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.147
And if you're not, tough shit.

26:51.317 --> 26:52.360
You gotta do it anyway.

26:54.655 --> 26:55.697
[sniffles]

26:55.781 --> 26:58.533
Bottom line, you gotta do
whatever you can...

26:59.534 --> 27:00.869
to care for that kid.

27:05.373 --> 27:08.084
[sniffles] Wanna know
how I'm gonna be a great dad?

27:08.168 --> 27:09.335
Mmm?

27:09.419 --> 27:10.921
'Cause I had such a great one.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.930
-[Colt sniffles]
-Sweet Jesus.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.642
-Let's watch some football.
-Yeah.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.984
[indistinct chatter]

27:41.076 --> 27:43.745
-Hank, what are you doing?
-Drinkin'.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.749
Is this a trick question?

27:50.543 --> 27:53.421
I mean, what are you doin' here
on Christmas?

27:54.089 --> 27:57.467
Well, I used to spend the holidays
with my best friend.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.928
Then, five years ago, he passed away.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.889
Aw, geez.
I... I'm sorry to hear that.

28:02.973 --> 28:04.140
You know what...

28:05.058 --> 28:07.185
this one's on me.

28:07.268 --> 28:08.937
Thanks, Maggie.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.650
Oh, I just got a text.
Another friend just died.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.286
-Hey, Hank.
-Hey, Beau.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.373
What the hell are all these people
doin' in here on Christmas?

28:28.456 --> 28:32.002
Well, probably escaping their families.
What are you doin' here?

28:33.211 --> 28:34.629
The same.

28:36.965 --> 28:40.010
I want to apologize
for my behavior last night.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.722
I'm still trying to get the hang
of this divorce thing.

28:44.472 --> 28:47.433
Hey, we're both workin' through this
in our own ways.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.853
I came home, smoked a joint,

28:49.936 --> 28:52.605
sucked the middles
out of a box of Twinkies.

28:55.066 --> 28:58.694
You know how you said we ought to
give each other a little space?

28:58.779 --> 29:00.071
Yeah.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.198
That's gonna be a problem.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.701
What's this?

29:05.786 --> 29:10.874
Wait, isn't this the bottle we were saving
for when we had our first grandkid?

29:10.957 --> 29:13.584
-Yep.
-Oh, no. Rooster?

29:13.668 --> 29:15.503
-Colt.
-Abby.

29:15.586 --> 29:17.923
-Heather.
-Fuck!

29:25.388 --> 29:26.639
[door opens]

29:31.727 --> 29:33.396
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:36.649 --> 29:37.650
How you feeling?

29:39.110 --> 29:40.111
Okay.

29:45.575 --> 29:46.868
I got somethin' for you.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.123
[sniffles]

29:53.041 --> 29:54.209
[Colt chuckles]

29:55.418 --> 29:56.252
Turn it over.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.800
-Says Bennett on the back. [chuckles]
-Cute.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.510
Figure he can't crap his jersey
any more than I crapped mine, right?

30:04.594 --> 30:05.804
[chuckles]

30:07.931 --> 30:09.933
-Colt.
-So...

30:11.434 --> 30:15.104
I've been thinkin'... a lot about this.

30:20.235 --> 30:25.949
And I want you to know, this kid will
absolutely be my first priority.

30:29.202 --> 30:32.330
And you... you're gonna be a great mom.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.667
And I'm gonna be a great dad.

30:37.585 --> 30:41.006
And the three of us,
we're gonna make a great family.

30:42.465 --> 30:43.466
So, uh...

30:46.010 --> 30:47.095
I was thinking...

30:47.803 --> 30:49.097
Colt, please stop.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.349
No. No, listen. I want to do this.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.350
Colt...

30:55.103 --> 30:56.562
I'm gettin' an abortion.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.869
