and bring me the arrow, it
will show us the way to Earth.

01:09.862 --> 01:13.114
TIGH: I am placing you under
arrest, Madam President.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.324
This is mutiny.
You know that.

FISCHER: Yeah.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.058

far. I'm calling for him.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.148
FISCHER: He's gotta be drugged.

to do that here, though?

stick him and release the pressure.

Could this be a prelude
to a Cylon attack?

03:43.974 --> 03:45.266
How would they know
where we are?

03:45.392 --> 03:47.268
RACETRACK: Valerii could have
told them, sir. What? How?

03:47.352 --> 03:48.603
When we were
aboard the Base Star,

03:48.687 --> 03:49.896
she left the Raptor for a few minutes

03:49.980 --> 03:51.689
and came back
without her helmet.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.609
She might have told the Cylons
everything, our position, defenses...

03:54.693 --> 03:56.402
KELLY: Colonel, the toasters
have knocked out our CO.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.904
This has gotta be
part of a bigger plan.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.865
I recommend we execute jump to
emergency standby coordinates.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.910

what's your plan here?

04:20.719 --> 04:23.054
Personally, I tend to
go with what you know

04:23.722 --> 04:25.848
till something
better turns up.

to the emergency coordinates.

04:32.648 --> 04:33.648
Go!

Sir, Doc Cottle is
still 15 minutes away.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.152
He'll have to rejoin us on
the other side of the jump.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.446
Sir, what about our people
on the surface of Kobol?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.868
If they're still alive,
they'll have to wait.

Mark!

05:12.145 --> 05:15.022
Captain, what have they
done to you? What's going on?

05:15.273 --> 05:16.774
My father's been shot.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.406
What?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.826
Someone get this frakking
thing off me, please?

05:26.910 --> 05:28.202
I'm not authorized to do that yet.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.579
I'm behind
the frakking bars!

05:35.961 --> 05:37.378
Captain,

05:38.547 --> 05:40.214
how bad is your father?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.176
Bad.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.971
Two bullets in the chest.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.935
Is Dr. Cottle with him?

No. Doc Cottle's not on board.

Am I the father?

Excuse me?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.462
I'm clearly having a dream.

that would be great.

see the crash site,

in case Galactica
sends a rescue party.

sending a rescue party.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.316
That Cylons?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.319
Seelix, grab the ammo.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.820
Staggered formation,
I'll take point.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.155
Chief,
you're bringing up the rear.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.489
Be ready to
double-time it, people!

10:57.574 --> 10:58.699
One, two, three!

10:58.783 --> 11:01.827
El-tee, I think we should double-check
the supplies before we bug out.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.413
Sorry, Chief, we don't have the
time. If that's an aircraft turbine,

11:04.497 --> 11:05.998
they're gonna be
on us any moment!

11:06.082 --> 11:07.583
El-tee, we've gotta make
sure we have everything!

11:07.667 --> 11:08.917
We don't have the time,
Chief!

11:10.420 --> 11:11.420
Damn it.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.757
Gods damn it.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.343
What's going on, Saul?
Where's the fleet?

11:17.427 --> 11:19.928
We don't know. They
jumped to another location.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.513
You've got
blood on your pants.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.848
Why would they do that?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.808
Every watch,
we update our emergency

11:24.893 --> 11:26.935
jump calculations
with new star fixes

11:27.020 --> 11:28.687
to compensate
for inertial drift.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.898
And then we transmit them
to the rest of the fleet.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.859
This time, ours were updated,
but theirs weren't.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.987
Gaeta was supposed to transmit
them to the rest of the fleet.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.322
So it's Gaeta's fault.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.116
The kid was overwhelmed.
He had his hands full.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.203
If you say so. It sounds like
a pretty big screw-up to me.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.581
I should have checked before
I gave the order to jump!

11:48.625 --> 11:52.711
This doesn't sound like you,
Saul. You don't let people slide.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.671
You bust their ass.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.049
Now if Bill
doesn't make it...

11:57.133 --> 11:58.175
He'll make it.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.136
If he doesn't, this will
be your ship. Your command.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.221
All I'm saying is
you need to be...

12:02.305 --> 12:04.473
This is
Bill Adama's ship.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.517
This is his command.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.979
His orders are still the
word of the gods on this ship.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.690
Just so we're clear.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.570
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.365
And we are not
going to let him die.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.827
So say we all.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.412
ALL: So say we all.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.704
As you were.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.168
So how do we find the fleet?

12:34.546 --> 12:36.797
If we jump back to our
original coordinates,

12:36.881 --> 12:38.590
our Nav computers
can use those star fixes

12:38.675 --> 12:40.300
to generate
a best-fit solution

12:40.385 --> 12:42.136
giving the fleet's
current position.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.513
The Cylons are waiting
for us back there.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.434
How long will it take to
calculate once we get back there?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.936
If we shut down
all other functions,

12:51.521 --> 12:52.521
12 hours.

12:55.525 --> 12:59.111
TIGH: There's no way we can hold
off a Cylon Base Star for 12 hours.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.032
We have got to jump
back. We can't stay here.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.909
Lieutenant Thrace
won't be able to find us

13:05.994 --> 13:07.911
once she retrieves
the arrow from Caprica.

13:07.996 --> 13:08.954
If she retrieves the arrow.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.414
She'll retrieve the arrow.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.041
Captain, you've got to get reinstated.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.793
You've got to
get back to CIC.

13:15.086 --> 13:18.172
You've got to denounce me, disavow
me, do whatever you need to do.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.633
Colonel Tigh cannot relocate this
fleet on his own without your father.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.218
Tigh's not letting me
out of here.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.344
I put a gun
to his head.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.054
He won't forget
that anytime soon.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.727
I am so sorry that I got
you into this, Captain.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.230
No, don't apologize. I
knew what I was doing. I...

13:36.232 --> 13:39.109
And I didn't do it for you.
I did it for...

13:40.403 --> 13:44.072
Well, actually, I did it
for nothing, turns out.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.743
That's not true.
You took a stand.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.495
And now look at us.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.775
TYROL: Watch your foot.
SEELIX: Okay.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.713
Everyone take five.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.104
Give me the med kit.
Where's the med kit?

15:05.154 --> 15:06.113
How you doing?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.864
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

15:08.283 --> 15:09.324
Good.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.160
Just listening to the birds.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.413
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

15:20.086 --> 15:21.712
I'll be damned.

15:21.796 --> 15:22.796
I don't remember
the last time I heard birds.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
(COUGHS)

15:25.341 --> 15:26.341
Take it easy, okay?

15:29.887 --> 15:31.096
Damn it.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.309
We're out of Serisone.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.478
Tarn, get the other med kit.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.607
What other med kit?

15:42.734 --> 15:45.235
Don't frakking tell me. We
pulled two med kits from the ship.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.778
I told you to keep
an eye on both of them.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.655
I only saw the one, sir.
There were two!

15:49.782 --> 15:51.783
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't
remember you telling me...

15:51.868 --> 15:53.201
Well, I did!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.954
Sir, his lungs are
filling up with fluid.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.124
If he doesn't get more Serisone
soon, he's not gonna make it.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.635
Okay. All right, Tarn.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.512
You forgot the med kit, so you're
gonna have to go back and get it.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.890
Take a rifle, three clips
of ammo, and a canteen.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.058
What?

16:17.268 --> 16:18.435
Move.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.527
Cally, come here.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.113
Watch the rear.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.077
El-tee,
you can't send him alone.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.745
You questioning
my orders, Chief?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.997
No, I'm just pointing
out a flaw in your plan.

16:39.082 --> 16:42.501
It doesn't need to be any bigger than
that. Cally and I can go with him.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.672
All right, fine.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.423
But would you
look out for Cally?

16:48.883 --> 16:52.177
Cally, give me the rifle.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.099
We three go. Leave that,
leave your backpack.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.560
TYROL: Sidearms out.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.354
Tarn, you're bringing
up the rear.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.399
In the middle,
eyes and ears.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.628
Her consciousness is being downloaded
into another body right now.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.715
And when she wakes up, she'll
tell them exactly where we are.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.426
She's right.
We can't stay here.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.180
She's right, huh?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.728
Sharon the Cylon is right.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.607
Let's all just listen
to Sharon the Cylon,

17:48.151 --> 17:51.820
do whatever she says,
'cause that's a good idea.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.656
Hey, Kara, she helped me get this far.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.409
Okay, I get it.
I get it, Helo.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.078
You and I go way back,
so I get it.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.664
All right, I remember
how you felt about her.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.583
But that is not
the real Sharon.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.043
That is some
cheap knock-off copy.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.589
I'm not a copy. I'm Sharon.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.426
I remember the first
day I met you, Starbuck.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.011
You were puking your
guts out in the head

18:16.095 --> 18:18.096
because you'd
eaten bad oysters on...

18:18.181 --> 18:19.723
Don't do that.
Hey!

18:19.891 --> 18:23.018
I don't like it,
and I don't like you.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.688
So the best thing you can do is
just keep your damn mouth shut.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.983
Starbuck, put it down, for gods' sakes.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.777
What do you
want from me, Helo?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.195
She's a Cylon.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.697
You've been had.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.073
We've been had.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.161
So what, I'm just
supposed to be nice to her

18:42.205 --> 18:43.705
because she says
she's pregnant?

18:48.878 --> 18:50.253
Get out of the way.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.547
No.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.383
Karl, do not think
that I will not shoot...

18:57.094 --> 18:58.512
I'm not gonna
let you kill her!

18:58.596 --> 19:01.306
Okay?
She's carrying my child!

19:02.892 --> 19:05.602
My gods, men are so
painfully stupid sometimes!

19:05.686 --> 19:06.686
How do you know that?

19:06.771 --> 19:09.981
I know, all right? She's not lying.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.152
They lie about everything,
Helo.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.948
Their entire existence
is a lie.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.577
They're not human,
Helo. They're machines.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.247
You can't have a baby with a machine!

19:25.832 --> 19:27.749
I don't know what
to tell you, okay?

19:28.042 --> 19:29.125
But I believe her.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.047
It's hard to describe. We've
been together a long time.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.549
I mean,
I know what she is,

19:35.633 --> 19:37.175
but she is not
like the others.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.928
She is not.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.314
No, no, no, no, no!

20:01.325 --> 20:02.951
Bitch took my ride.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.835
MAN: Yeah, go ahead.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.300
How's he doing?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.760
Well, the bullets
tore up his spleen.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.470
His blood pressure
is way down.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.222
Somebody needs to get in
there and stop the bleeding

20:24.307 --> 20:25.640
or we'll lose him.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.225
(ECG MACHINE BEEPING)

20:27.560 --> 20:29.185
ADAMA: So what's your plan?

20:30.354 --> 20:31.980
TIGH: Don't really have one.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.109
I'm getting back
in the cockpit.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.987
I'm getting
back into my fleet.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.989
I want you to
come with me, Saul.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.035
You really believe that we
can get back in the fleet?

20:45.328 --> 20:46.703
Yeah, I do.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.997
Yeah, I do.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.918
How long until
Doc Cottle's aboard?

20:53.836 --> 20:55.003
I don't know.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.090
It's gonna be a while.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.092
He doesn't
have much time, sir.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.767
You're gonna have
to go in yourself.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.771
Me? I'm just a medic.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.522

that's what you're asking.

Then he's alive.
Thank the gods.

to shoot the old man?

it's at the Raptor.

kit when you forgot it?

that's the El-tee's kit.

Secondly, I'm on point.

All right, children,
that's enough.

Tell you what, Cally. If it
makes you feel any better,

24:45.442 --> 24:48.236
I'll put him on hangar deck mop-up
duty with you for the next week.

I'm gonna put him here, Cal.

gonna stay right here, okay?

now. Let's just try...

stupid frakked-up crap!

Chief, Socinus needs us now.
Come on.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.561
Come on. Let's go.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.310
Not your fault, Lieutenant.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.270
Not from where
I was standing.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.439
I was the OOD.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.067
It was crazy in there, sir.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.069
You can't blame yourself.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.472
So, we jump back to
the last coordinates,

28:44.807 --> 28:47.392
but we network the FTL
computer with the Nav, DC,

28:47.476 --> 28:49.268
and fire control computers.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.062
Once they're linked,

28:51.146 --> 28:53.356
we'll only need 10 minutes
to complete the calculations.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.233
You can't be serious.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.361
The old man would
never do this, Colonel.

28:58.654 --> 28:59.987
No computer networks
on his ship.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.823
I acknowledge that, sir.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.868
But I can devise a software
firewall that will buy us more time.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.621
Really? You're going to out-think
the Cylons at computer software?

29:08.705 --> 29:11.332
Sir, if we don't do this, we're
never gonna find the fleet.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.002
Certainly not before
the Commander dies.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.424
This is still
the old man's command.

29:19.508 --> 29:20.758
We can't do
something he'd oppose,

29:20.843 --> 29:23.302
especially when it puts
the entire ship at risk.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.950
This is the XO.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.536
Begin jump prep.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.290
Those are my orders.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.180
The kid is back in the fleet!

30:07.264 --> 30:08.931
Bill, let's have the truth.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.308
So how did you do it?

30:10.392 --> 30:12.143
How'd you get off
this frakking freighter?

30:12.227 --> 30:15.980
Connections. Anne's father has a
friend on the Defense Subcommittee.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.607
So the new
wife comes through.

30:18.192 --> 30:20.193
I wish I had
in-laws with pull.

30:20.277 --> 30:21.903
Give me a couple of years.
