WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:05.885
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.040 --> 00:08.486
I'm trying to move product,
more than twice the usual drop.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.722
It's about the money, QDubs,
always about the money.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.247
That it is.
Until a family member get clipped,

00:13.400 --> 00:15.084
and then shit
turn into something else.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.725
Angela doesn't have
anything on us.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.929
No files, wiretaps,
phone records, nothing.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.649
Here are the possible
matches for the sketch.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.643
Tommy Egan is Ghost.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.120
I said and did some things
that you may have misunderstood.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.241
Misunderstood?

00:29.400 --> 00:32.290
Just don't want you to...
be confused.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.440
Any news on the shooter?
Give me something, Julito.

00:34.465 --> 00:36.084
I put word out
to my Miami connect.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.687
Time's up, motherfucker.
Where's your bitch?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.415
Got people looking for her.
I gotta find her first.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.655
She hasn't answered her phone.
No one's seen her.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.091
It's like she fucking
disappeared.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.160
I'm sending you
on a little trip for the weekend.

00:46.185 --> 00:48.247
You like Miami?

00:48.440 --> 00:50.568
Stern is sending me
to Miami to sign a contract.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.085
You trying to leave without me?

00:52.280 --> 00:54.089

- I'm telling Mom!
- Go ahead!

02:42.200 --> 02:44.885
Raina!

02:45.040 --> 02:47.168
Ma, can you tell Raina
to get off my PlayStation?

02:47.320 --> 02:48.924
No! And what did I tell you

02:49.080 --> 02:50.960
about barging in people's room
without knocking?

02:50.985 --> 02:52.490
Where's Dad?

02:52.640 --> 02:55.769
He's in Miami
on business for the club.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.970
- It's weird without him here.
- You're just spoiled.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.363
Other kids' fathers
travel all the time.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.649
Other kids' fathers
don't own nightclubs.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.802
They don't get shot at at work.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.561
Come here. Come here, Tariq.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.087
You don't have to worry
about your dad, okay?

03:19.240 --> 03:21.607
He's just fine.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.723
You're the man of the house,
all right?

03:23.880 --> 03:25.723
- Hold it down.
- Okay.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.689
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.764
And when you talk to him,

03:30.920 --> 03:32.760
can you tell him to get me
a Miami Heat jersey?

03:32.785 --> 03:34.489
No, I will not ask him
for any such thing.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.642
This is a Knicks family, okay?

03:36.800 --> 03:39.451
All right, please, go.
Get out and get ready for school.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.409
Raina!

03:44.080 --> 03:46.447
Mom said you had
to give it to me. Come on!

03:55.960 --> 03:58.645
To us...

03:58.840 --> 04:00.649
finally making it to Miami

04:00.840 --> 04:03.002
and waking up together
for the first time.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.928
You did not have faith in me.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.926
It was hard to have faith
in anything there for a while.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.889
Yeah, for a minute there
I actually wondered

04:18.040 --> 04:19.803
if you were gonna show up...

04:19.959 --> 04:22.088
and miss all of this.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.567
I'm sorry about that.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.326
I got caught up at work.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.400
I don't wanna think
about work now.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.082
Me neither.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.924
No work. Just us.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.526
It's everything we wanted.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.808
Right?

04:45.560 --> 04:49.121
Everything we wanted.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.009
♪ All the way
from where I started ♪

04:51.160 --> 04:53.322
♪ To the present, yeah,
1987, year of the legend... ♪

04:53.520 --> 04:56.808
Dude, I told you
not to eat in my car.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.480
I just got out
the motherfucking joint.

04:58.505 --> 05:00.851
Ain't no "savies"
when it come to Crown Fried.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.287
You're getting crumbs
all over my goddamn ride!

05:03.440 --> 05:04.930
- Hey, gimme a fry.
- Hell, no.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.845
I told your dumb ass to order
something while we was there.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.649
You know, a motherfucker
steal from me,

05:14.800 --> 05:17.610
usually wind up disappearing
or getting his ass beat in the shower.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.728
Remind not to get in
the fucking shower with you.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.524
You've been institutionalized
too long.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.887
Well, I'm out.
I'm ready to get back to work.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.520
So you're gonna tell me how you
and Ghost handle this shit now?

05:26.673 --> 05:28.233
Still running
our distribution business.

05:28.273 --> 05:31.846
Sell wholesale to Soldados,
Tainos, and Rock Street.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.160
Didn't them motherfuckers fold
after Rolla got clipped?

05:34.280 --> 05:36.965
No, Rolla's second-in-command
QDubs is running shit now.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.487
They still got the same territory
where we used to run shit?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.608
You know it,
our old stomping grounds.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.569
What are we doing over here?

05:43.720 --> 05:46.769
We damn sure ain't about
to wash some clothes.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.604
This is where we clean our money

05:48.760 --> 05:50.091
so we can pay our rent and shit.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.090
Clean the money?
Sound like some Ghost shit.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.000
Always trying to look
like a goddamn citizen.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.003
Man, hand-to-hand cash
is the move

05:57.160 --> 05:59.720
when you're washing money.
We learned from you and your car wash.

05:59.745 --> 06:02.371
You remember that?

06:02.520 --> 06:05.251
Ghost ain't never had a good idea
he didn't steal from you.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.249
Hang out, man,
I'll be right back.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.925
One player.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.044
How's it going, Victor?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.931
It's a good thing
I don't pay you by the hour.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.606
<i>Got molasses</i> in <i>my ass, boss.</i>

06:43.760 --> 06:44.966
How we doing?

06:45.120 --> 06:47.009
We're looking good.
We're looking good.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.926
I tell you, Simon Stern
is taking over the fucking world.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.730
- Okay.
- He sent me out here

06:59.880 --> 07:01.769
to get some acquisition
contracts signed, right?

07:01.920 --> 07:03.729
- Right.
- Getting these guys to sign over

07:03.880 --> 07:06.850
a percentage of their clubs to him,
just like he did me.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.445
Same shit.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.601
- Oh, man.
- Fucker.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.843
You never grow up.
He just gotta show you

07:13.000 --> 07:14.968
he's in charge by making you
his proxy.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.960
Yeah, well, right now,
he's got the advantage.

07:16.985 --> 07:18.649
I gotta do what he wants
to the letter.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.485
If I fuck it up, then he owns
my club permanently.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.086
Then he doesn't know you
very well.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.969
You never quit.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.566
That's something
we've got in common.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.728
You've worked hard
to get to this point,

07:33.880 --> 07:35.405
and I'm proud of you.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.080
Don't let Stern
mess with your head.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.121
Okay?

07:45.160 --> 07:47.845
You need to get that?

07:49.360 --> 07:51.010
Nope.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.011
- Should we go get some lunch?
- Yep.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.922
- Yo, T, what's up?
- 'Sup, man?

08:07.080 --> 08:09.128
I was hoping to catch you
before you bounced.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.044
- Who's this?
- Yo, J, this is Kanan.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.043
He used to run
with me and Ghost.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.282
He just got out.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.125
- Puerto Rican?
- Cubano.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.250
If Tommy and Ghost are cool
with you, I am, too.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.526
Cool. Cool. Hey,
let me holler at you real quick, T.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.331
Go ahead, do your thing.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.201
You know, fuck that.
We all family here.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.725
Go ahead, J.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.325
Yo, Cristobal's backing out.
Yeah, he asked for a meet,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.280
and then said he was
gonna find a new connect.

08:43.304 --> 08:46.083
- Tainos are out, bro.
- The fuck is that about?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.360
Some shit about there's
too much heat on us right now.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.525
You hear from Ghost?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.640
Yeah, he hit up my cousin's
cigar shop down there.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.369
Copped an untraceable.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.363
Guess it comes
with a Cohiba on the side.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.966
Word.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.280
The girl who shot up the club
is hiding in Little Havana.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.563
Ghost went down to Miami
to cancel Christmas on her ass.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.210
Should have sent you.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.970
Know you would have
sliced her up,

09:09.120 --> 09:12.090
make a motherfucker think twice
about stepping up again.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.442
Finally, someone who speaks
my fucking language.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.602
Ghost had an excuse
to go down there.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.330
Something about the nightclub.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.687
You ask me, he just wanted
to make sure Rolla hired her.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.571
- He's still thinking 'bout that.
- It's 'cause they was friends.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.724
I told Ghost, your friend betray you,
cut 'em, don't think twice.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.963
- I said that to him, too.
- Hey, where's the head at?

09:30.120 --> 09:31.680
And then he starts
with the prison talk.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.628
It's in the back,
around the corner.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.491
Yo.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.961
Hey, I need you on the
next thing smoking down to MIA.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.881
- You got a location on the girl?
- For sure. I need you to roll out now.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.401
All right, done.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.761
It's like
we're any other couple.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.083
No looking over our shoulders.
You and me.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.164
- Nothing to worry about.
- Right?

10:25.480 --> 10:28.131
Reminds me of visiting
my cousins down in P.R.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.320
You know, the first time
Tommy and I came down here,

10:30.345 --> 10:32.930
we bugged out
one of these old cats here.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.811
The best thing about Miami,
it's super close to the United States.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.045
How is Tommy?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.280
I haven't seen him
since that day at the Sweet Shop.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.926
You know, same old Tommy.
He got a new girlfriend.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.406
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.484
- Redhead?
- What you think?

10:50.640 --> 10:54.440
Some things never change.
But I don't wanna talk about Tommy.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.604
I want to talk about you.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.087
- And me.
- Yeah?

11:00.240 --> 11:04.165
In that café around the corner
that serves the best croquetas in Miami.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.290
- I am hungry.
- Well, it's right around the corner.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.920
Big-ass giant chicken in front.
You can't miss it.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.401
As opposed to all
the other chickens out here?

11:12.560 --> 11:14.403
Exactly.
Why don't you go get us some?

11:14.560 --> 11:17.131
I'll watch these olds cats play
a couple of games of dominoes.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.482
- Okay.
- All right.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.200
- I'll be back in a second.
- All right.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.369
- Oh, money.
- I got my own money, thanks.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.400
No, no, papé.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.922
Yow!

14:09.640 --> 14:11.722
You need to slow the fuck down.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.640
Yo, Dad, you sure
you don't want me to drive?

14:13.665 --> 14:15.090
I'm just a little rusty,
that's all.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.440
Besides I'm giving you a break
while G's in South Beach.

14:17.465 --> 14:20.927
- How long is he gone?
- I don't know. A few days, I think.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.686
Where he staying?
Somewhere fancy, I bet.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.445
Eden something. Eden Roc, maybe?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.364
Bougie motherfucker.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.600
That nigga think he the King
of England or some shit.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.127
So what's up with you and Tasha?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.762
I saw the way you was looking
at her the other night.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.490
- Nothing.
- Well, one thing's for sure,

14:42.640 --> 14:44.200
you didn't get
your lying skills from me

14:44.225 --> 14:46.128
'cause that right there
was a dead giveaway.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.601
It's nothing, Dad, all right?
She's just fine, that's all.

14:48.626 --> 14:51.729
And married to your boss...
who happens to be your Uncle G.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.882
It's not even like that,
all right? She's cool.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.849
- I'm not checking for her...
- Listen to me.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.646
A fine woman who knows
she fine is trouble.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.643
Now, that bitch bad.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.495
And she knows she's bad.
So you watch your back.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.329
I mean, Ghost taking care
of financial needs.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.720
What she want with you?
Unless you telling her something.

15:06.745 --> 15:09.450
- You ain't telling her nothing, is you?
- No.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.409
No.

15:46.440 --> 15:50.809
I was just thinking what
it would be like if we lived here.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.560
I mean,
that was the plan, right?

15:55.680 --> 15:57.682
It was.

It still is the plan,

16:12.720 --> 16:15.451
I don't know
how it all works, you know?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.251

If they haven't
filled it yet, maybe.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.285
Would you bring the kids
down here for summers?

16:24.440 --> 16:27.410
Yeah, there's a school down here,
the Gulliver School.

16:27.560 --> 16:31.246
Supposed to be the best in Miami.
I'd get them in there.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.926
You already looked it up?

16:37.760 --> 16:40.923
- What about Tasha?
- I'll make Tasha a very rich woman.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.003
She'll be okay.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.530
What about you?

16:45.680 --> 16:48.286
You really ready
for all of this?

16:51.200 --> 16:55.285
Change your whole life
for... me?

16:55.440 --> 16:59.525
Yes. I think I would.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.931
You think?

17:08.960 --> 17:11.486
I should probably take this.
Sorry.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.890
Hey-

17:22.359 --> 17:24.965
Did you use my password
to pull the voice recording

17:25.119 --> 17:26.929
that Medina and I made
at Ruiz's hideout?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.969
Greg, let me explain.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.566
No, no. There's nothing to explain.
It's very simple...

17:31.720 --> 17:34.041
I told you not to do it,
and you did it anyway,

17:34.200 --> 17:36.080
leaving me no choice
but to report this to Mike.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.560
What's more important,
nailing Lobos or following protocol?

17:38.640 --> 17:42.406
Both, Angela! Fuck...!
You cannot just do

17:42.560 --> 17:44.560
whatever you fucking want
in this department, okay?

17:44.585 --> 17:46.225
You're not even on
the goddamn task force!

17:48.440 --> 17:50.283
Listen, if Egan doesn't pan out,

17:50.440 --> 17:52.488
I'll go to Mike myself
and make a full confession.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.484
But if I'm right, no one will care
how we got the info

17:55.640 --> 17:57.369
so long as we twist Egan
to give up Lobos.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.569
And how the hell
are we gonna do that?

18:00.760 --> 18:03.570
Tommy Egan drives
a blue 1967 Mustang.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.210
Get the license plate
from the DMV

18:05.360 --> 18:07.124
and contact the management
at LeFrak

18:07.280 --> 18:10.250
to see if that car showed up
on any of the security cameras

18:10.440 --> 18:12.090
while Ruiz was holed up there,
okay?

18:12.240 --> 18:14.368
That's a long shot at best.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.284
Can we talk in person?

18:16.440 --> 18:18.602
Greg, I can't.
I'm actually out the next few days

18:18.760 --> 18:20.967
dealing with some stuff
for my dad.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.323
Well, I'll... I'll call you
when I have something.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.847
Actually, it's gonna be hard
for me to talk.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.361
Text me,
and I'll call you, okay?

18:29.520 --> 18:31.568
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.489
Thought you and Greg were over.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.849
He's sure blowing you up
like he's still your man.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.202
Okay.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.211
Greg and I work together,
so occasionally we have to talk.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.328
So he's a lawyer, too.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.763
No, but we work
in the same department.

It doesn't have to, right?

19:55.280 --> 19:56.566
Right.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.695
I'm still trying to wrap my head
around how you let Ghost

go down to the land of ass
and titties by himself.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.840
Look, we're trying
to move forward in our marriage.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.644
I can't keep dwelling
on the past.

to me, he don't have to worry

because I'm-a be right there
watching his ass do it all.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.727
I know, okay.
No, Ghost and I are good.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.521
Okay. So you gonna stop getting
them bank statements sent my house?

20:20.680 --> 20:23.047
I didn't think so.

20:23.240 --> 20:27.006
Keisha, seriously, I think
we're really gonna be fine.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.769
Nah, bitch. That's fine.

20:31.920 --> 20:32.967
Damn.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.929
Tariq...

20:35.080 --> 20:37.320
didn't I tell you to stop
bouncing the ball in the house?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.084
- Sorry, Ma.
- Did you at least

20:39.240 --> 20:41.760
finish your homework before
you went to hoop like I told you to?

20:41.785 --> 20:43.004
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.844
Riq, don't lie to me.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.809
Okay.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.962
Go ahead. Go to your room.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.202
Do not come out until you
finish your homework.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.283
- All right.
- Okay.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.643
Damn, Shawn, you sweating
like you was balling for real.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.529
You know I had to school
Riq a little bit.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.840
I used to hoop at St. John's
before I blew out my knee.

21:00.865 --> 21:02.444
I didn't even know
you went to college.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.523
Okay, well, I did.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.251
- You want a water or something?
- Actually, no, I'm good.

21:07.400 --> 21:11.200
Yeah, I'm actually about to head home,
so I'll catch up with y'all later.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.124

is not wrapped around your finger

- Take your time.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.286

from getting some "puro."

21:49.440 --> 21:51.886

21:52.080 --> 21:54.082
Cohiba.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.168

What kind of club is this anyway?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.129
I don't know.

Not even half.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.921
Your fucking boss is trying
to take over my nightclub

22:41.080 --> 22:42.809
with these equity
and debt triggers.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.082
My boss, Mr. Stern,
is just trying

22:45.240 --> 22:46.969
to form a partnership with you,
that's all.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.009
My club's been

22:49.160 --> 22:51.686
the hottest thing in Miami
the last three years, okay?

22:51.840 --> 22:54.200
We're gonna continue to grow
without any buy-ins from Stern,

22:54.280 --> 22:55.560
or anyone else, for that matter.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.410
I strongly urge you
to reconsider.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.604
I strongly urge you
to get the fuck out of my club.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.522
I'll be in touch.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.445
Angie, I'm not going back to Stern
short of the goal line.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.126
He'd love that.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.851
- Can I take a look at these?
- Knock yourself out.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.480
Anyway, I was thinking
we could check out a Heat game

23:33.520 --> 23:37.206
or take a swamp tour
of the Everglades, your pick.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.885
Jamie, have you looked
at these contracts?

23:42.040 --> 23:43.480
Yeah, I looked over
all the documents

23:43.600 --> 23:46.206
once they were signed.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.404
This contract has
operational covenants

23:49.560 --> 23:51.961
that, if failed, cause a default,
and the entire loan

23:52.120 --> 23:53.929
becomes due immediately

23:54.080 --> 23:57.289
or the entire business
goes to Stern.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.800
The other ones don't have this.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.401
Lee's contract is different.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.166
No one in their right mind
would agree to those terms.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.321
So it's a win-win
for Stern either way.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.970
If I get Lee to sign that contract,

24:19.120 --> 24:21.248
then great for him, and if not,
then he just uses it

24:21.400 --> 24:24.131
as another obstacle
for me to get my club back.

24:24.280 --> 24:27.921
- I can't let that happen.
- This contract is airtight.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.203
Then I need to find another
motivation to get Lee to sign.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.569
I could look him up
in court records,

24:41.720 --> 24:44.166
see if anything pops.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.608
If he's been sued or anything,
it'll be in there.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.842
You'd do that?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.650
Thanks, Ange.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.161
I can go to the local
office tomorrow,

24:59.320 --> 25:01.641
do a search from there.

25:01.800 --> 25:06.089
And while I'm there,
I could look into a transfer.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.561
If you were serious.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.449
Yes.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.841
You should do that.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.447
Wait, wait. What were you saying?
I couldn't hear you.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.011
I just heard back
from the manager

25:28.160 --> 25:30.401
at the LeFrak Projects
where Ruiz is holed up.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.530
Tommy Egan's blue Mustang
was photographed in the garage

25:33.680 --> 25:36.331
the same day we recorded
the distributor on Nomar's mic.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.723
That's great. Send me a copy?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.008
Yeah.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.242
I'll do you one even better.

25:46.840 --> 25:50.003
I just sent you an electronic copy
of everything in Egan's file.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.242
- I need a workstation.
- Sure. Over there.

be our Ghost after all.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.329
All we have to do now is put
Egan at Nomar's aunt's place

26:17.480 --> 26:20.404
the night of the murder,
and we got him dead to rights.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.325
- It's gonna be funny.
- What?

26:23.480 --> 26:25.767
Well, you... you said
you know Egan, right?

26:25.920 --> 26:27.800
I mean, the look on his face
when he sees a girl

26:27.990 --> 26:29.833
from high school
is trying to put him in jail.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.967
Sheesh.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.962
And yet you have work.
Typical Valdes.

27:15.120 --> 27:19.648
- How are you?
- I'm... fine. Yeah.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.007
Tony and the girls
love it down here, so...

27:22.200 --> 27:27.411
And you? You married yet?

27:27.560 --> 27:29.050
- Any kids?
- No.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.646
- No?
- I'm seeing a guy, though.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.246
Could turn into something.
Not sure.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.165
In fact, it could mean
that I might move down here.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.005
You in Miami? Say no more.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.162
There's a job for you
wherever I am.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.766
I will kick one of these bozos
out on the street if I have to.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.322
Thank you. That means a lot.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.729
- I need to ask you a work question.
- You don't stop?

27:51.880 --> 27:53.450
You see why I'd want you
on my team?

27:53.600 --> 27:56.843
- This is me.
- This is you?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.401
- Yes, see?
- Congratulations.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.847
Thanks. Sit.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.604
What's up?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.766
What if hypothetically you
had a criminal forfeiture case

28:08.920 --> 28:12.129
where there were two businessmen...
One dirty, one clean.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.682
Is there any way to save the business
for the innocent guy?

28:15.880 --> 28:17.769
I have a friend
in a similar predicament,

28:17.960 --> 28:19.405
and I want to protect him.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.400
Are you 100% sure your friend
had nothing to do

28:21.480 --> 28:23.280
with his business partner's
criminal activity?

28:23.320 --> 28:24.810
Yeah, he's clean.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.531
Then the only way for him
to retain his assets

28:27.720 --> 28:30.371
is if you can prove lack of knowledge
and lack of intent.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.086
You may also have to bring him in
as a non-target witness,

28:33.240 --> 28:35.846
and he also actually
may have to testify

28:36.000 --> 28:37.889
against his business partner.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.122
Think you can get him
to do all that?

28:44.200 --> 28:45.247
I don't know.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.529
Angela, if you approach him
about testifying

28:48.680 --> 28:51.684
and he's not innocent, he could
blow your case wide open.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.322
He could warn the target.
He could give you false testimony.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.131
He could cause you
some serious trouble.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.443
Are you sure
he's worth the risk?

29:11.560 --> 29:13.961
Shawn, who taught you
how to play basketball?

29:14.120 --> 29:17.567
Man, my pops started me off.
Then I joined the team at the Boys Club.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.805
My dad used to play with me
all the time, but not anymore.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.725
Riq, come on, man,

29:24.880 --> 29:27.167
your dad would hoop with you
every day if he could,

29:27.320 --> 29:30.324
but he's always working so you could
sport those J's that you're rocking.

29:34.920 --> 29:38.003
Ma told me that your dad
went away like...

29:38.160 --> 29:41.448
Like on a trip
or something or...?

29:41.600 --> 29:45.605
Nah, man. He was in prison.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.404
He went in when I was your age.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.881
Hey, Shawn.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.769
I didn't know you were here.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.367
Yeah, I invited him over so he
could help me with my history project.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.564
Well, are you guys hungry?
Do you want a snack or something?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.722
I am. Make me something?

30:00.880 --> 30:02.723
Girl, we just ate.
You know that.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.609
Go ahead and put
your clothes away, please.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.525
Actually, I'm good, Ms. St. Patrick.
I'm gonna head out in a minute.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.927
Tariq, did you put
your dirty clothes

30:12.120 --> 30:15.044
- in the laundry like I asked?
- No, not yet.

30:15.200 --> 30:19.410
- So...?
- So, I'll go do that now.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.642
Okay.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.200
Shawn?

30:30.360 --> 30:32.601
You mind helping me put
some of these cans

30:32.760 --> 30:34.808
on the top shelf, please?

30:36.960 --> 30:38.485
Yeah, sure.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.051
- Right here?
- Yes, please, thanks.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.569
I know I don't
say this enough, but...

30:52.720 --> 30:54.961
I love having you around.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.961
And I really appreciate
you being here,

30:59.120 --> 31:01.361
you know, with Ghost
out of town and everything.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.330
Yeah, well, you guys
are like family to me.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.005
And Tariq's like...

31:06.160 --> 31:08.640
Like the little brother
I never had, so...

31:08.840 --> 31:11.241
What are you trying to say,
Shawn?

31:11.400 --> 31:13.243
That you look at me like a mom?

31:16.440 --> 31:18.363
More like a big sister now.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.201
You need anything else?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.926
No. I'm good. Thanks.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.923
Cool.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.760

Yo, I just landed in Miami.
I found our boy.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.406
Bottom line is once I find
this girl... thank you, sir...

32:20.560 --> 32:22.720
Still ain't gonna help
with our weight-pushing problem.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.489
Lobos doesn't care
about a pink sneaker.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.290
His only concern
is a green dollar.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.488
Ruiz has agreed
to make peace with RSK.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.484
So I need you to talk
QDubs off the fence.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.449
Play nice, Tommy. We need him.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.840
Who you think you're talking to?
I know how to play nice.

32:35.865 --> 32:37.435
My part of the plan
is on point up here.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.602
All you gotta do is
follow Ghost to baby girl

32:39.760 --> 32:41.649
and shut her mouth
before he does, all right?

32:41.800 --> 32:44.565
- All right. No doubt.
- Gotta go.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.010
Where you want me to drop you off?
I need to head out to Queens.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.730
- Gonna go see QDubs?
- Yeah.

32:51.880 --> 32:55.089
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.920
Listen, if you want me
to be your wingman,

32:56.960 --> 32:58.485
I'll go with you, I don't care.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.250
Be good to see
the old neighborhood.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.088
Yeah, okay. Let's do this.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.321
Jamie?

33:35.400 --> 33:37.368
- Yes?
- Mrs. St. Patrick,

33:37.520 --> 33:40.000
your husband requested an in-room
deep-tissue massage for you.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.124
I just need you to sign right here,
right beside your name.

35:04.440 --> 35:08.240
Hello? We're closed.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.010
Do you want to buy something?

35:14.240 --> 35:16.288
- Lo siento.
- No, lo siento.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.529
Solids again.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.600
I'm beginning to think
the stripes don't like me.

35:36.625 --> 35:38.887
Fuck you, man.
You ain't won yet.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.044
L just won three. You keep betting,
you gonna go broke.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.483
Or you get back down with us,
lace your whole crew.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.529
The choice is yours, QDubs.

35:47.680 --> 35:51.287
Five ball, corner pocket.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.960
You got a lot of balls, man,
trying to come in my stand

35:54.985 --> 35:57.486
- and hustle me for money.
- Your stand?

35:57.640 --> 36:00.644
We made this run. I gave this territory
to Ghost and to Tommy,

36:00.840 --> 36:02.888
and they gave it to you.
This shit is a loan.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.122
Don't make us collect.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.726
- How you gonna do that?
- What?

36:07.880 --> 36:10.247
Yo, What Kanan is saying

36:10.400 --> 36:14.644
is we ain't your enemies, QDubs.
We're you're friends.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.448
I know who you are, "old head."

36:19.600 --> 36:21.967
Rolla and them used to talk
about you all the time.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.805
RSK stood toe to toe
with you behind the wall.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.645
Now, you out and you're running
around with white boy over here?

36:27.800 --> 36:29.450
You should be wearing green.

36:29.600 --> 36:33.650
We should all be
making green... together.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.484
Now, if I can get Ruiz
to meet with you,

36:35.640 --> 36:37.280
can you shelve this beef
once and for all?

36:37.320 --> 36:39.049
Yo, why the fuck
would I want to do that?

36:39.200 --> 36:42.044
We all still behind the opinion
that Ruiz got Rolla clipped.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.200
Now, come on, you know
that Ruiz didn't kill Rolla.

36:44.280 --> 36:48.888
Ghost said that same shit.
How y'all so sure about it, man?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.202
Unless y'all killed Rolla
y'all selves.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.521
That's what happen, Tommy?

36:54.680 --> 36:56.569
You killed my brother?

36:56.720 --> 37:00.122
All right.
Let's cut the bullshit, Q.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.766
- Ghost loved Rolla.
- So he said.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.922
But people say a lot of shit.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.760
Look, I'm not fucking with y'all
and them Puerto Rican niggas again.

37:07.840 --> 37:11.561
I got a new connect. Russian cat.
Same quality, lower price.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.087
So y'all can get
the fuck up out of here.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.323
You know, you ain't
never been that smart.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.642
It ain't...
It ain't your fault, man.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.968
You don't come
from good parents.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.440
You know the real reason
why they call you "Quarter-Water"?

37:25.465 --> 37:27.407
'Cause your mama
used to charge 25 cents

37:27.560 --> 37:28.891
to pull a nigga dick
after school.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.008
Yo, fuck you,
you bitch-ass nigga.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.200
- Peek-a-boo.
- Don't shoot!

37:43.400 --> 37:45.448
Sorry. Witnesses are a bitch.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.524
Who the bitch-ass nigga now?

37:48.680 --> 37:50.603
Let's get the fuck out of here.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.690
You awake still?

38:12.840 --> 38:16.686
Yeah. I wanted to see you.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.442
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.050
You're a sight for tired eyes.

38:42.400 --> 38:46.325
So... I looked up Lee Rossier.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.450
Found some things
you can use for sure.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.409
What did you find?

38:58.320 --> 39:01.563
- This is great.
- You owe me big.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.802
I do owe you big.

39:05.920 --> 39:09.527
You know, I was filling out
my paperwork

39:09.680 --> 39:12.365
at the office today, and...

39:12.520 --> 39:15.091
all this...

39:15.240 --> 39:18.449
it's finally feeling real.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.681
It is real.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.728
I'll show you.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.526
It's real, Angie.

40:19.520 --> 40:23.764
That was...

40:23.920 --> 40:25.968
I know.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.686
Jamie, I love you.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.801
I don't wanna lose you.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.087
Why would you lose me?

40:48.840 --> 40:51.650
I need to ask you a question.

40:52.840 --> 40:55.286
Shoot

40:57.680 --> 41:01.605
What exactly is your
relationship with Tommy?

41:01.760 --> 41:03.967
Is his name on all the documents

41:04.120 --> 41:06.885
of the laundromats and the club?

41:07.040 --> 41:09.202
Why you asking me this?

41:19.760 --> 41:22.286
I'm an Assistant
United States Attorney

41:22.440 --> 41:25.171
working a drug case,

41:25.320 --> 41:28.642
and I think
Tommy Egan's involved.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.962
I know he's your friend,

41:31.120 --> 41:34.329
but Tommy's been
in the streets our entire lives.

41:34.480 --> 41:37.131
Didn't you ever once question
how he got enough money

41:37.280 --> 41:39.328
- to invest in your business?
- No.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.403
Fuck, no.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.967
Look, I don't know everything
about everyone.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.920
Hell, I just found out
you're law enforcement.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.480
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you before.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.000
You're sorry you didn't tell me
before you're a fucking cop?

41:51.025 --> 41:53.211
I wasn't allowed
to tell you... by law.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.846
In fact, I could lose my job,
my license.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.240
I could go to jail for telling you
all of this right now.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.285
Then why you telling me?

41:59.440 --> 42:02.171
Because I'm gonna
put Tommy in jail

42:02.320 --> 42:04.601
- and you could lose Truth...
- I can't believe this shit.

42:04.626 --> 42:06.849
Everything you worked for.
I can't let that happen.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.522
So you and me... us,
it's all a ruse?

42:10.680 --> 42:12.364
- What? No.
- What do you mean, "What"?

42:12.520 --> 42:14.522
The night you came in the club?

42:14.680 --> 42:16.680
You came in the club,
we ran into each other again,

42:16.831 --> 42:18.401
is that so you could
get close to Tommy?

42:18.551 --> 42:19.725
Jamie, of course not.

42:19.880 --> 42:23.601
- Bullshit.
- You have to believe me.

42:23.760 --> 42:26.127
I don't have to believe shit.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.090
There is no going back now.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.444
I don't want you
to lose your future

42:32.600 --> 42:34.568
because you're mixed up
with Tommy.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.690
And I don't wanna lose you
either.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.763
I love you.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.088
What does it mean?

42:55.240 --> 42:58.323
You're asking me
to testify against Tommy.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.723
I known him 20-plus years.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.769
You want me
to testify against him.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.764
It might be the only way
to save your dream.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.887
Our dream.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.081
Have you ever heard anyone
on the streets

43:20.280 --> 43:23.250
call Tommy by the name Ghost?

43:26.160 --> 43:28.242
No.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.884
Never.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.771
Tommy Egan's not what you think.

43:46.320 --> 43:49.563
- He's not.
- And if I prove that he is?

43:55.040 --> 43:59.329
Will you help me
if I can help you...

43:59.480 --> 44:01.562
or will you leave me?

44:23.000 --> 44:26.322
I can't leave you.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.766
I can't leave you.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.444
Fuck, Angie.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.801
I mean...

44:39.840 --> 44:41.922
I love you.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.482
I love you.

45:14.040 --> 45:17.089
Tommy, I haven't gotten her yet.
My flight leaves tonight,

45:17.240 --> 45:20.164
so I might have to stay longer
to get it done.

45:20.360 --> 45:22.727
Okay. All right.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.370
We'll talk about it later. Okay.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.284
- Hey!
- There you are.

45:26.440 --> 45:27.771
Here I am.

45:27.920 --> 45:29.729
I didn't even hear you
leave the bed.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.486
Yeah, I've been on the phone
with Stern all morning.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.768
He's telling me I may have
to stay another few days,

45:34.960 --> 45:37.042
talk to more club owners.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.965
Jamie, I feel weird
about last night.

45:43.120 --> 45:45.964
I don't want my job,

45:46.120 --> 45:47.640
the fact that we're
investigating Tommy

45:47.800 --> 45:49.802
to change this, to change us.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.486
I won't let Tommy or anything
come between us.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.640
I'm not gonna tell anyone
what we discussed, okay?

45:54.680 --> 45:57.729
You can trust me, Ange.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.167
We'll be fine.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.522
Just like we planned.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.011
So you're still in... with us?

46:09.800 --> 46:12.610
Un poquito.

46:12.760 --> 46:15.764
Look... a hundred percent.

46:24.120 --> 46:26.487
Come here.

46:31.920 --> 46:35.891
James St. Patrick.
I did some research on you.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.883
Found out the evil empire
bought your building,

46:38.040 --> 46:39.530
and you joined forces with them.

46:39.680 --> 46:42.524
What happened?
They break your spirit?

46:42.680 --> 46:45.524
Nah. I'm just a survivor.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.360
I was in a tough spot
for a moment,

46:48.400 --> 46:50.607
but I did whatever I had to do.
It's okay.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.520
I'll be the last man standing
in my nightclub

46:52.545 --> 46:54.752
when it's all said and done.
The question is, will you?

46:56.280 --> 46:57.850
I did some homework
on you, too, Lee.

46:58.040 --> 47:00.042
Turns out chapters <i>7</i> and 11

47:00.095 --> 47:02.015
are the biggest stories
in your nightlife career.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.880
Defaulting on your rent,
packing up and leaving

47:03.905 --> 47:05.887
in the middle of the night
like the goddamn Colts.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.361
Fuck you. I had some bad luck.

47:08.520 --> 47:10.887
I'm still not signing my club
over to anyone.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.804
And I get that. I do.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.564
But sometimes
we all just need a push...

47:14.720 --> 47:17.883
Bullshit, this contract's filled
with all sorts of operational covenants.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.644
You and I both know that.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.882
There's no way I meet
all those restrictions.

47:22.040 --> 47:24.930
Now you see that?

47:25.080 --> 47:26.440
You gotta believe
in yourself more.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.323
I have faith in you.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.244
Lee, come on, man,
you are a visionary.

47:30.400 --> 47:32.289
You're a hard worker.
Look at this place.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.044
This deal takes debt
off the table

47:34.240 --> 47:36.561
while giving you more cash
to grow your business.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.404
You get to retain
day-to-day control.

47:38.560 --> 47:41.086
Is it the best deal?
No. Hell, no.

47:41.240 --> 47:45.245
But you and I both know
you need a lifeline.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.086
That's what Stern is offering,
a lifeline.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.090
You sign one of these?

47:58.240 --> 48:00.083
Yeah, I did.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.607
- Then you know.
- Know what?

48:02.760 --> 48:05.286
Once you get in bed with Stern,
it's near impossible to get out.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.606
Just once, I'd like to beat the guy
at his own game.

48:10.760 --> 48:12.762
Actually, I have a thought
about that.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.161
Your landlord in this building,

48:15.320 --> 48:17.200
turns out he's been sued
a couple of times, too.

48:17.225 --> 48:18.505
He's late on his mortgage again.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.440
If he defaults,
the place goes up for auction.

48:20.465 --> 48:22.761
Simon Stern swoops in,
he buys the place

48:22.960 --> 48:25.440
right up under his nose
while stealing your dream.

48:25.600 --> 48:29.127
And then he'll have you
by the balls forever.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.807
But if you and I
work hard, man...

48:32.960 --> 48:34.883
and we put money away,

48:35.040 --> 48:37.646
then we can beat him
to the punch.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.963
But that's another conversation
for another day. Right now...

48:43.960 --> 48:47.965
your John Hancock
at the bottom of this contract.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.122
What do you say, Lee?

48:57.400 --> 49:01.485
You're good. You know that.

49:01.640 --> 49:05.008
There is no way Stern's
letting you go without a fight.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.367
Well, I sure as hell
am looking forward to it.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.481
Nice doing business with you.

49:10.640 --> 49:11.766
Likewise.

49:11.920 --> 49:14.685
You... you're a smart man.

49:14.840 --> 49:16.001
I know.

49:21.600 --> 49:23.523
You got nice hands, Shawn.

49:23.680 --> 49:27.287
You know, chicks don't like dudes
with crusty hands and feet, right?

49:27.480 --> 49:29.403
So what, do you get
like a manicure every week?

49:29.560 --> 49:31.244
- Every two.
- That's so metro.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.727
Come on, you guys...

49:33.880 --> 49:36.531
- Oh, shit!
- Did you just curse?

49:36.680 --> 49:39.570
Raina, don't start. Go to bed.
I'll take it from here.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.246
- And watch the glass. Be careful.
- So where do live, Shawn?

49:42.400 --> 49:44.721
I'm out at my mom's,
Jamaica Estates.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.240
What, you need a ride
or something?

49:46.265 --> 49:48.322
Isn't Lamar coming
to pick you up?

49:48.480 --> 49:51.400
Girl, I'm tired, and Shawn's here,
so I might as well hop a ride with him.

49:51.549 --> 49:52.755
- Yeah, it's cool.
- All right.

49:52.909 --> 49:56.087
You're being a jerk!
Mom, Tariq's pushing!

49:56.240 --> 49:57.571
Please! Stop pushing!

49:57.760 --> 49:59.410
All right, girl.
I'll call you tomorrow.

49:59.560 --> 50:01.200
Yeah, I'm gonna see you,
Mrs. St. Patrick.

50:01.225 --> 50:04.434
- Mom!
- You know, what's the problem?

50:06.920 --> 50:09.651
We already made
dinner reservations.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.451
We can get steak
and seafood in New York.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.480
When's the next time
we're gonna be able to have

50:14.505 --> 50:16.891
authentic Cuban food in Miami?

50:17.040 --> 50:18.963
It's our last night in town.

50:19.160 --> 50:20.960
I don't wanna go
to a "special occasion" place

50:21.040 --> 50:23.281
like it's special
that we're here.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.569
I was just wanting us to pretend

50:26.720 --> 50:30.122
that it's a regular night
at a regular place.

50:31.400 --> 50:33.926
Whatever you want, mami.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.320
Thank you.

50:35.480 --> 50:38.165
Anything to see that jump.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.682
Perfecto. Venga.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.611
Gracias.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.762
I'm just glad that Lee
signed the contract.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.491
- Thanks to you.
- Don't mention it.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.642
Where would I be without you?

51:09.800 --> 51:12.246
I have no idea.

51:25.680 --> 51:28.490
Maybe I'll get
the Cubano sandwich.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.802
The Cubano?

51:51.800 --> 51:53.643
I'll be right back.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.484
So I'll order the Cubano
with the waitress.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.642
Okay. Perfect.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.728
Fuck!

53:21.760 --> 53:25.128
Who hired you? Rolla?

53:34.080 --> 53:36.128
You dumb motherfucker.

53:36.280 --> 53:38.851
No.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.004
No... not Rolla.

54:05.960 --> 54:08.964
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.610
That was Stern again
just telling me

54:10.760 --> 54:13.889
I don't have to stay longer
to talk to any more club owners.

54:14.040 --> 54:16.247
So we can fly home together.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.244
- That's great, Jamie.
- Yeah.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.568
- Salud.
- Salud.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.325
She goes chasing me around.

54:25.480 --> 54:27.244
"You better get out of there!"

54:27.400 --> 54:29.323
That's funny.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.883
Yeah, but hold up.
I didn't know you had a son.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.241
Yeah.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.243
How come you never
bring him around?

54:37.400 --> 54:40.802
The short of it is I split custody
with my ex out in Jersey.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.243
Okay. And what's the long?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.207
Ghost and Tasha have everything.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.489
Taking my kid over there is like
giving him a day pass to Disneyland.

54:52.680 --> 54:55.331
And then bringing him
back to this?

54:55.520 --> 54:57.682
We ain't never
gonna live like that.

54:57.840 --> 55:01.401
I gotta settle
for her hand-me-downs.

55:01.560 --> 55:05.087
Everything nice that I have
used to be Tasha's.

55:12.120 --> 55:15.727
I gotta get this.

55:15.880 --> 55:20.681
You really feeling my girl,
like, for real.

55:20.840 --> 55:24.322
No. No, it's not even like that.

55:24.480 --> 55:26.881
I mean, she's all right, but...

55:40.960 --> 55:43.167
You sure about that?

56:08.480 --> 56:11.165
I wish we could've
stayed in Miami.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.482
Me, too.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.569
You need to take that?

56:19.720 --> 56:22.087
No, it's probably club business.
I'll deal with it at home.

56:26.920 --> 56:29.082
Thank you.

56:36.160 --> 56:39.562
Thank you so much
for everything, Jamie.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.563
Let me give you a ride home.

56:41.720 --> 56:43.802
No, I have a couple of calls
I gotta make.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.924
- I'll just take a cab.
- You sure?

56:51.280 --> 56:52.645
