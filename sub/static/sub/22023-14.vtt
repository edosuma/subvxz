WEBVTT

00:00.281 --> 00:03.016
Cheese, what is it?

00:04.373 --> 00:06.740
- Dried milk.
- Uh, no.

00:06.808 --> 00:09.659
- I don't think that's true.
- It is. It is, Amy.

00:10.191 --> 00:11.077
It's in a PowerPoint.

00:11.146 --> 00:13.380
Now, we all know the standard cheeses.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.733
American cheese,
cheddar cheese, pizza cheese.

00:17.389 --> 00:20.720
But what if I told you
there's one more out there?

00:20.789 --> 00:22.115
- Pepper jack?
- No.

00:22.115 --> 00:23.223
- Gouda?
- Swiss!

00:23.560 --> 00:26.158
- Kraft Singles.
- Goat, Parm, blue, ricotta.

00:26.159 --> 00:28.161
- I could name at least ten more.
- No, you guys, it's not...

00:28.197 --> 00:30.830
- You knowhat's really good?
- Grilled cheese.

00:31.427 --> 00:32.566
Hot tip, Kelly.

00:32.634 --> 00:35.126
No, guys, stop just
yelling out random words.

00:35.439 --> 00:36.818
You're throwing me off.

00:38.552 --> 00:42.300
But what if I told you
there's one more out there?

00:44.956 --> 00:47.208
Human cheese!

00:47.209 --> 00:49.142
Oh, my God, is that what this is?

00:49.211 --> 00:51.072
I've had five samples already.

00:51.079 --> 00:53.671
No, no, this is just
cut-up string cheese.

00:53.671 --> 00:55.549
I don't have enough money
for a prototype.

00:55.618 --> 00:58.187
But it'll basically be
exactly like that, I think.

00:59.006 --> 01:03.327
So who's ready to invest in the breast?

01:03.892 --> 01:06.503
It'll be udder-ly amazing!

01:06.762 --> 01:09.296
- That's cows.
- Damn it, Sandra!

01:09.365 --> 01:11.518
You're messing with my flow.

01:12.518 --> 01:13.489
Ugh.

01:20.173 --> 01:22.313
Cheese, what is it?

01:23.712 --> 01:25.122
Dried milk.

01:26.741 --> 01:29.895
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:31.520 --> 01:32.619
Ooh.

01:32.655 --> 01:33.887
Just like a couple of plums

01:33.939 --> 01:35.539
nestled in a pair of Dockers, huh?

01:35.624 --> 01:37.270
- What?
- Jonah's butt.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.726
- That you're staring at.
- No, I'm not star...

01:39.795 --> 01:42.929
- I'm not staring at anything.
- Oh, sorry.

01:42.998 --> 01:45.242
Just, you told me
about your crush on Jonah,

01:45.243 --> 01:46.833
and I'm an ass gal,
so I guess I just assume

01:46.902 --> 01:48.368
- everyone's an ass gal...
- Shh, Dina!

01:48.420 --> 01:50.671
- What?
- It's not a crush.

01:50.723 --> 01:52.072
And plus, I told you that in private.

01:52.124 --> 01:53.640
But just so you know,

01:53.717 --> 01:55.248
Kelly's gonna start suspecting something

01:55.249 --> 01:57.199
- if you keep lashing out at her.
- What are you talking about?

01:57.201 --> 01:59.324
I don't lash out at Kelly.

01:59.982 --> 02:03.850
Hey, Sandra, do you remember any time
that Amy was lashing out at Kelly?

02:03.919 --> 02:06.303
January 4th, you said,
"Kelly, I assume you've been

02:06.388 --> 02:07.854
to a monster truck rally."

02:07.923 --> 02:10.340
January 12th, you said,
"Two people saying you look

02:10.425 --> 02:12.442
like Reese Witherspoon
is not a lot of people."

02:12.528 --> 02:13.927
- Okay, we got it.
- Thanks, Sandra.

02:13.996 --> 02:17.497
January 20th, you said, "Wow, did they
teach you that at pageant school?"

02:17.566 --> 02:20.467
January 21st, you said, "Wow, did they
teach you that at pageant school?"

02:20.536 --> 02:22.102
- Okay, we got it Sandra.
- Thank you.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.106
- Kelly!
- Hi.

02:33.107 --> 02:34.363
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

02:34.431 --> 02:36.016
Sorry, I'm working as fast as I can.

02:36.085 --> 02:38.635
- I just have a few more left.
- Oh, no, no worries.

02:38.721 --> 02:39.870
I'm not here to rush you,

02:39.955 --> 02:41.855
I just came over to say, "Hey, girl."

02:41.924 --> 02:43.560
Oh, "Hey, girl" back.

02:44.460 --> 02:45.756
Hey, girl.

02:47.162 --> 02:50.879
Yep, just, um, came on over
to hang out with my friend.

02:51.467 --> 02:52.734
- We're friends?
- Yes.

02:53.435 --> 02:54.601
I mean, sorry, it's just sometimes

02:54.670 --> 02:56.494
it seems like you don't like me.

02:56.495 --> 02:58.371
Oh, you mean because
sometimes I razz you?

02:58.440 --> 03:01.775
Oh, my God, Kel, you know I'm,
like, the joker of the store.

03:01.844 --> 03:04.111
Because you wear all that lipstick?

03:04.179 --> 03:06.447
It's just gloss, and I only
wear a little bit of it.

03:06.448 --> 03:08.415
No, because I joke around with everyone,

03:08.467 --> 03:10.983
- especially my friends.
- Really?

03:11.386 --> 03:13.102
Yes, of course.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.485
You cutie.

03:19.928 --> 03:20.704
Oh oh!

03:22.064 --> 03:23.327
Someone's in trouble.

03:24.183 --> 03:26.064
- Oh, my God.
- I hung that sign.

03:26.518 --> 03:29.183
Well, it was probably
just a faulty anchor.

03:29.407 --> 03:30.406
What anchor?

03:30.739 --> 03:33.445
- You didn't bolt the anchor?
- There's bolts too?

03:34.576 --> 03:37.636
Guys, I'm telling you, the
human mammary dairy market

03:37.637 --> 03:39.157
is about to explode.

03:39.448 --> 03:43.771
Question: if I invest,
can I still eat regular cheese?

03:43.927 --> 03:44.922
Dude.

03:45.516 --> 03:45.997
No.

03:46.462 --> 03:47.882
Hey, how about you guys?

03:47.883 --> 03:50.559
Who's ready to join
the boob cheese revolution?

03:51.093 --> 03:53.582
Uh, sorry, I was distracted.

03:54.041 --> 03:56.045
That guy has a real gay
Dothraki vibe going,

03:56.046 --> 03:58.231
and #Intolt.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.000
- You should go help him.
- You want me to just

04:00.052 --> 04:03.025
- go up there and talk to him?
- It's literally your job.

04:03.026 --> 04:08.064
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

04:09.144 --> 04:11.820
Do you guys just hate chants?
Be honest with me.

04:12.212 --> 04:14.753
I am so screwed. This is, like,
my third screwup this week.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.533
I'm gonna get in so much trouble.

04:16.618 --> 04:19.190
- What happened?
- Who put this up?

04:21.607 --> 04:23.456
Um, Glenn, I...

04:23.525 --> 04:25.179
It was me. I did it.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.600
- Amy, you don't have to...
- It's okay, girl. I got you.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.923
- Amy, you did this?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

04:31.148 --> 04:35.017
I was just rushing, and I
forgot to anchor the bolt.

04:35.063 --> 04:36.628
So you used duct tape?

04:37.362 --> 04:38.970
Yes, I did.

04:40.209 --> 04:42.549
I really, really didn't
think that one through.

04:43.247 --> 04:44.342
Okay, but...

04:44.813 --> 04:47.192
you got to be careful.
These things are heavy.

04:47.395 --> 04:48.038
Yes.

04:48.951 --> 04:51.012
- Clean it up.
- I will. Will do.

04:52.821 --> 04:53.996
Thank you so much.

04:53.997 --> 04:55.888
You did not have
to take the blame for me.

04:55.889 --> 04:58.575
It's totally fine. I got you, girl.

04:58.660 --> 05:00.877
- It's all good, friend.
- Aw.

05:00.963 --> 05:03.243
And plus, no one got hurt, so no biggie.

05:05.651 --> 05:06.388
Hey.

05:07.436 --> 05:08.394
Don't you hate Tuesdays?

05:10.806 --> 05:12.072
Oh, my God.

05:14.194 --> 05:16.557
Why would you take the blame
for Kelly's mistake?

05:16.794 --> 05:19.289
Look, I was trying to show her
that we're friends.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.865
Oh, this is about the Jonah crush.

05:21.866 --> 05:23.682
- Shh.
- Man, that secret

05:23.682 --> 05:25.975
just keeps getting tastier and tastier.

05:25.976 --> 05:27.951
Mmm, that is one good secret.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.771
Okay, that's enough.
Look, can you please

05:29.772 --> 05:31.279
just not tell anyone?

05:31.347 --> 05:33.247
Hey, like I said, you can count on me.

05:33.316 --> 05:34.732
And if you want to sell the lie,

05:34.818 --> 05:36.631
I will sell this lie hard.

05:40.259 --> 05:42.225
What... what... what...
what are you doing?

05:42.294 --> 05:43.376
I'm trying to work up enough saliva

05:43.377 --> 05:44.896
so that we can do a spit handshake.

05:44.897 --> 05:46.129
It's just, I've got such drymouth.

05:46.198 --> 05:46.906
I think it's the pregnancy.

05:46.907 --> 05:48.147
Oh, don't worry about it.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.366
- We're good.
- No, no, no, no.

05:49.367 --> 05:51.234
Just give me a second. I'll get there.

05:51.303 --> 05:52.852
Oh, God, okay.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.539
No, Dina, really, I'm good. I trust you.

05:55.574 --> 05:56.850
Well, now I'm like a sprinkler.

05:56.851 --> 05:58.416
It won't stop coming out.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.177
Does it hurt when you rotate it?

06:00.245 --> 06:01.349
Of course it does.

06:01.350 --> 06:03.312
I got assaulted by a giant pot of gold.

06:03.521 --> 06:05.349
- Everything hurts.
- Hey, man.

06:05.350 --> 06:07.144
When I cut off my thumb
with the deli slicer,

06:07.145 --> 06:10.541
corporate gave me 200 bucks
just for promising not to sue.

06:10.542 --> 06:13.578
When I shattered my nose,
I held out and got $1,000.

06:14.076 --> 06:15.704
Wait, you can negotiate?

06:16.495 --> 06:17.923
No one told me that I can negotiate.

06:17.970 --> 06:19.212
Man, you should have held out.

06:19.298 --> 06:20.530
You could have already
launched Boob Cheese.

06:20.616 --> 06:21.548
Ugh...

06:21.549 --> 06:23.280
I wonder how much I could get.

06:23.281 --> 06:25.168
I mean, I'm not a very good negotiator.

06:25.530 --> 06:27.183
I just always want people to like me.

06:27.184 --> 06:27.915
Is that...

06:28.787 --> 06:29.883
- true?
- Yes!

06:30.201 --> 06:31.767
- I'm nice.
- Well, if you want,

06:32.094 --> 06:34.134
I could help you with the negotiation.

06:34.135 --> 06:35.879
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

06:35.948 --> 06:37.581
I mean, you are relentless and annoying.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.784
I was going to say because I
took a year of business school,

06:40.852 --> 06:42.352
but I will take that as a compliment.

06:42.437 --> 06:45.121
It's not, but, you know,
you hear what you want to hear.

06:45.157 --> 06:47.324
- You are nice.
- Maybe I should get hurt again

06:47.391 --> 06:48.521
and hold out for that big money.

06:48.522 --> 06:50.942
Mm-hmm, I definitely
think that's a good idea.

06:52.046 --> 06:53.830
- I feel so bad.
- I didn't know

06:53.899 --> 06:56.198
Mateo was gonna get hurt
when you took the blame.

06:56.206 --> 06:58.399
Don't worry about it. It's like I said.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.804
We're friends, and, you know, it's like,

07:00.889 --> 07:02.783
bitches before snitches, you know?

07:03.273 --> 07:06.300
Well, I am taking you out
for drinks tonight as a thank-you.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.180
You, me, half-off margaritas.
Like I always say,

07:09.181 --> 07:11.681
there's nothing a little
dancing on a bar can't solve.

07:11.750 --> 07:14.341
Wow, did they teach you that
in pageant sch...

07:15.339 --> 07:18.203
I mean, that is very wise
and well-observed.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.489
I'm very excited.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.938
Hey, don't you help her.

07:22.528 --> 07:24.844
This was Amy's mess, and she
needs to clean it up herself,

07:24.845 --> 07:26.162
or she will never learn.

07:26.866 --> 07:28.098
I'll just text you tonight

07:28.283 --> 07:30.248
about what I'm thinking of wearing.

07:31.203 --> 07:34.110
See, she does not suspect a thing.

07:34.404 --> 07:37.617
All right. Clean this up for real.

07:39.511 --> 07:40.327
One...

07:41.267 --> 07:42.121
two...

07:43.550 --> 07:44.278
Nope.

07:48.620 --> 07:49.407
Damn it!

07:50.305 --> 07:52.747
Uh, just trying to cut off my thumb.

07:55.711 --> 07:57.824
I'm sorry, why is Jonah here?

07:57.825 --> 08:00.030
Oh, I'm just here to give Mateo advice.

08:00.098 --> 08:01.510
I went to business school for a year.

08:01.511 --> 08:03.300
- Before flunking out.
- Irrelevant.

08:03.610 --> 08:06.011
Fine, okay. Uh, for the record,

08:06.054 --> 08:09.573
I should point out that Mateo and I
previously had a romantic relationship,

08:09.574 --> 08:11.546
but I'm confident that we can
keep everything professional.

08:11.546 --> 08:12.976
I would also like the record to reflect

08:13.045 --> 08:14.711
that your outfit makes you look like

08:14.780 --> 08:16.646
the assistant debate coach
of an Ohio middle school.

08:16.715 --> 08:18.683
Your objection is noted.

08:18.684 --> 08:21.921
Okay, uh, without accepting
any liability for your injury,

08:21.922 --> 08:24.236
Cloud 9 would like to offer you $1,000.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.516
I'll take this.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.970
- No.
- No?

08:28.971 --> 08:30.694
What do you mean, no?
You don't want the money?

08:30.762 --> 08:32.432
Oh, we want the money, Jeff.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.616
- But we want the real money.
- Yes.

08:35.933 --> 08:39.346
Okay, well, that is the real money.

08:39.861 --> 08:42.736
The offer is $1,000.
Take it or leave it.

08:46.194 --> 08:48.662
We will take the $1,000.

08:50.807 --> 08:51.490
Ah!

08:52.818 --> 08:54.071
Hey, Amy.

08:54.641 --> 08:57.220
I thought I'd have Sandra work with you.

08:57.289 --> 08:59.689
Oh, no, that's okay. I got this.

08:59.758 --> 09:02.275
Yeah, but wouldn't it be nice
to have some company?

09:02.276 --> 09:05.516
You know, someone to help you
and watch over you?

09:06.124 --> 09:09.413
Oh, okay. I see.

09:09.414 --> 09:11.234
What? It's not that I don't trust you

09:11.303 --> 09:14.186
or that I'm worried that
you'll injure someone else.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.720
No, no, of course not.

09:16.721 --> 09:19.642
I mean, you just said
it wasn't those things,

09:19.711 --> 09:21.379
so it's probably not those things.

09:21.380 --> 09:22.039
Right.

09:22.948 --> 09:24.388
It's a different reason.

09:25.650 --> 09:26.525
Like?

09:28.854 --> 09:30.957
- I will tell you later.
- Yep.

09:31.890 --> 09:34.260
Check issued upon completion
of background check?

09:34.261 --> 09:36.198
What does that mean?

09:36.354 --> 09:37.961
Mm, that seems pretty standard.

09:38.029 --> 09:40.266
They probably just want to make sure
you didn't do anything illegal.

09:41.554 --> 09:44.591
Illegal, like being
in this country illegally?

09:45.854 --> 09:48.455
All right, I just got off
the phone with corporate,

09:48.540 --> 09:50.273
and things are all good on their end.

09:50.342 --> 09:51.828
Are you done signing?

09:52.978 --> 09:54.324
Uh, um...

09:55.892 --> 09:58.572
you know what? I have decided to pass.

09:58.573 --> 09:59.911
We're gonna pass.

10:01.019 --> 10:02.615
- What?
- Yeah, so...

10:03.155 --> 10:04.788
I mean, no need for any of this.

10:04.856 --> 10:06.180
- Mm-mm.
- Um...

10:06.181 --> 10:08.594
I'm gonna go, and, um...

10:08.979 --> 10:11.550
good luck to you
in all your future endeavors.

10:11.963 --> 10:13.446
Excuse me.

10:13.532 --> 10:15.155
Sorry the deal fell through.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.066
Lot of great back-and-forth, though.

10:17.152 --> 10:19.677
Good sparring with you, buddy.
All right.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.343
Just go. Just go.
Just go when you say go.

10:23.926 --> 10:26.019
Just go when you say the word "go."

10:27.071 --> 10:28.770
Go on the word "go."

10:30.104 --> 10:30.574
Go!

10:30.942 --> 10:32.404
Ahh, damn it!

10:32.776 --> 10:34.523
Damn it! Bad!

10:39.141 --> 10:42.959
- Compromising safety harness.
- I was just loosening it.

10:43.028 --> 10:44.347
Okay, but now you're not secure.

10:44.348 --> 10:46.406
I am secure, Sandra.
And also, could you, like,

10:46.407 --> 10:49.128
maybe move, like, two inches that way?

10:49.129 --> 10:50.066
You're in my space.

10:50.222 --> 10:51.766
Glenn told me to stay close to you.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.042
And also, I'm terrified of heights,

10:53.043 --> 10:54.796
so I feel like the ground
is always just kind of

10:54.797 --> 10:56.820
- coming up at me...
- Okay, fine, fine.

10:56.821 --> 10:59.163
It's just making this
a lot more difficult.

10:59.164 --> 11:02.096
- Oh!
- Almost dropped sign.

11:03.035 --> 11:04.948
Almost? Are you serious?

11:05.016 --> 11:06.900
You're writing down almost mistakes now?

11:06.985 --> 11:09.886
- Now you're losing your temper.
- No, I'm not losing my temper, Sandra.

11:09.955 --> 11:12.349
I just don't think that you need to be
writing down every single little thing.

11:12.350 --> 11:12.790
Stop!

11:12.858 --> 11:14.224
- No, you stop it.
- Glenn gave that to me!

11:14.309 --> 11:15.792
- Back up, Sandra.
- We're moving!

11:15.877 --> 11:17.527
- We're going to die!
- Oh, my God!

11:17.596 --> 11:18.862
I need you to back up...

11:18.930 --> 11:20.163
Sandra, you're on me!

11:20.232 --> 11:21.631
Sandra, you're pushing me
into the lever!

11:21.700 --> 11:23.750
Sandra, snap out of it!

11:27.065 --> 11:29.275
Bloopers on a TV show are delightful.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.540
But in the workplace,
they can be dangerous.

11:32.962 --> 11:34.644
So I thought that some of us

11:34.713 --> 11:36.443
who have had a couple of incidents

11:36.444 --> 11:38.844
could review some basic safety training.

11:38.845 --> 11:41.427
Now, when would you
put out one of these?

11:41.744 --> 11:43.636
- On the holidays?
- No.

11:44.090 --> 11:44.999
Anyone?

11:46.826 --> 11:48.760
Now, when you're cleaning up that spill,

11:48.762 --> 11:51.011
you want a nice swaying motion.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.005
Think of it like you
took your mop to a dance.

11:54.403 --> 11:56.130
Okay, and dance with her.

11:56.199 --> 11:57.865
One, two, three.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.033
One, two, three.

11:59.068 --> 12:01.033
One, two, three. One, two, three.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.128
Okay, all right.

12:15.585 --> 12:18.119
Whoa!

12:18.188 --> 12:20.321
What are you doing?

12:20.687 --> 12:22.205
I'm trying to get injured.

12:24.486 --> 12:25.810
It's just hard to make myself do it.

12:25.895 --> 12:27.728
You know, the problem is,
you can see it coming.

12:27.797 --> 12:29.864
Yes, obviously that's the problem.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.466
You know, maybe,
and I'm just spitballing here,

12:32.535 --> 12:34.569
but maybe you have someone else do it

12:34.846 --> 12:36.477
so you're not expecting it.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.782
That's not a bad idea.

12:40.043 --> 12:41.209
Do you think you could do it?

12:41.277 --> 12:43.411
Me? Wow.

12:43.479 --> 12:46.445
Whoof, that's unexpected.

12:47.217 --> 12:50.046
Hmm, yeah, I'll do it. I'd be honored.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.410
I can't believe I have
to walk away from $1,000

12:52.410 --> 12:54.543
- just because I'm undocumented.
- It's so unfair.

12:54.612 --> 12:56.667
This country was built
on the backs of immigrants...

12:56.668 --> 12:58.218
Okay, calm down.
I can tell my own story.

12:58.219 --> 13:00.047
- And you should be able to.
- Okay.

13:00.345 --> 13:03.580
I just spoke to corporate.
This one time,

13:03.971 --> 13:06.242
they're willing to go up to $1,500.

13:06.865 --> 13:08.897
Final offer, no exceptions.

13:09.762 --> 13:12.234
Unfortunately, I'm still gonna pass.

13:13.340 --> 13:17.111
Okay, but $1,500 is as high
as they're willing to go.

13:17.112 --> 13:19.113
I mean, it's $1,500.
You understand that, right?

13:19.114 --> 13:21.228
I understand. The answer is still no.

13:21.229 --> 13:23.219
Okay, okay, fine, fine.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.129
$4,000.

13:25.130 --> 13:26.193
- Whoa!
- Holy crap.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.669
And that's it. That's it, though.

13:27.670 --> 13:28.928
That's the cap.

13:29.029 --> 13:31.848
- I thought $1,500 was the cap.
- That was the fake cap.

13:31.856 --> 13:34.161
Technically, we're allowed
to go as high as $4,000,

13:34.162 --> 13:36.394
- but that is it.
- That's the final offer.

13:36.854 --> 13:38.689
I'm sorry, Jeff, okay? It's still...

13:38.690 --> 13:40.431
$6,500, final offer.

13:40.483 --> 13:42.099
I feel like we have
different definitions

13:42.168 --> 13:43.737
- of the word "final."
- It's not about the money.

13:43.738 --> 13:46.541
- Okay, the answer is no.
- Wow, okay, great.

13:46.542 --> 13:50.900
Congratulations,
you just lost out on $6,500.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.983
Sweet dreams thinking about that.

13:55.412 --> 13:56.380
$15,000.

13:59.534 --> 14:02.689
Amy? Hey, it's Jessie.

14:02.690 --> 14:07.121
- I'm Cindy's mom.
- Oh, yeah, of course, hi.

14:07.122 --> 14:09.507
I heard about you and Adam,

14:09.508 --> 14:11.405
and I just wanted to say
I hope everything's okay.

14:11.406 --> 14:14.152
Oh, yeah, no,
everything's great, actually.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.335
- Thanks for checking.
- Amy?

14:16.601 --> 14:18.378
I need a urine sample from you.

14:18.995 --> 14:21.814
Oh, um, I'm sorry, I can just...

14:21.815 --> 14:24.871
No, Dina, this isn't really
the best time for this.

14:24.872 --> 14:27.357
Hey, that's what happens when you
keep screwing up on the job.

14:27.358 --> 14:28.723
We have to find out if it's due to drugs

14:28.724 --> 14:30.318
or just gross incompetence.

14:32.624 --> 14:34.055
It's not drugs.

14:35.803 --> 14:39.114
Hey, this was lovely.
So see you at the next PTA.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.774
Hi, David, I have Mateo Liwanag,

14:42.775 --> 14:46.109
the employee who was injured,
and Jonah Simms,

14:46.110 --> 14:48.692
another employee, for some reason.

14:48.693 --> 14:50.071
Hey, Mateo, I hear you're refusing

14:50.072 --> 14:51.468
to sign the liability waiver.

14:51.469 --> 14:53.744
A little concerned your lawyer's
giving you some bad advice.

14:53.759 --> 14:54.837
Oh, I'm not a lawyer.

14:54.838 --> 14:57.050
I just went to a year
of business school.

14:57.051 --> 14:59.603
- Before flunking out.
- I'm on your side, you know.

14:59.604 --> 15:02.637
So look, we're prepared
to offer you $50,000.

15:02.638 --> 15:05.315
- $50,000?
- Whoa.

15:06.242 --> 15:07.508
Uh...

15:07.560 --> 15:09.519
- that is a lot of money.
- Uh, uh-huh.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.999
And I wish I could take it.
But the truth is,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.592
um, I'm not really hurt.

15:14.670 --> 15:16.625
- David, he's lying.
- I'm lying?

15:17.145 --> 15:19.541
What about all the times
you said you were over Chad

15:19.542 --> 15:20.914
and you just jumped
right back into bed with him?

15:20.979 --> 15:23.121
- After you dumped me!
- I'm sorry, David.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.899
- That's not relevant.
- That's okay.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.607
I have a gay son, so my views
are very progressive.

15:27.608 --> 15:30.081
Okay, what about the time you
said Jonah looks great in shirts?

15:30.164 --> 15:32.118
Yeah, were you lying
or telling the truth then?

15:32.119 --> 15:34.241
I said he looks okay in shirts,

15:34.242 --> 15:36.207
but you wouldn't know that
because you never listen.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.881
Because you add unnecessary details!

15:37.881 --> 15:40.285
You spent an hour
talking about lavender!

15:40.286 --> 15:41.665
Uh, it sounds like you guys

15:41.666 --> 15:43.109
still have some stuff to figure out.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.503
Jeff, why don't you take care of this

15:44.504 --> 15:46.064
and get back to me later, okay?

15:46.065 --> 15:47.013
Thanks.

15:50.227 --> 15:50.986
Well...

15:52.208 --> 15:53.604
that got silly.

15:55.396 --> 15:56.498
'Sup, Marcus?

15:56.567 --> 15:58.767
Something's jammed in the box crusher.

15:58.836 --> 16:01.461
I was wondering if you could
climb in and get it out.

16:01.717 --> 16:03.118
You want me to get...

16:03.911 --> 16:06.373
- inside the box crusher?
- Yeah, thanks.

16:08.579 --> 16:12.044
It just... it feels like a box
crusher could hurt someone

16:12.490 --> 16:14.003
really badly.

16:14.004 --> 16:17.579
Only if somebody pushed the
button while you were inside it.

16:18.904 --> 16:21.183
There's no need to worry
about that 'cause

16:21.207 --> 16:22.790
I got the button right here.

16:24.023 --> 16:25.830
Yeah, okay.

16:26.849 --> 16:28.697
Sandra, your tushie

16:28.732 --> 16:30.079
needs to be closer to the ground.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.350
- I can't go any lower.
- Okay, I don't want excuses.

16:33.351 --> 16:35.504
I want lower tushies.

16:35.572 --> 16:38.103
Ugh, I can't believe
they're making you do this.

16:38.104 --> 16:40.492
Yeah, no, me and you both.

16:40.493 --> 16:43.378
Elias, bend both your
knees, not just the one.

16:43.430 --> 16:46.097
I just feel so guilty.
I mean, I almost feel like

16:46.183 --> 16:47.949
maybe I should tell Glenn
that I was the one

16:48.018 --> 16:49.076
that messed up the signs.

16:49.077 --> 16:51.358
Well, I mean, you know,
don't do it for me.

16:51.359 --> 16:53.171
But, like, if you really want to.

16:53.257 --> 16:55.486
Yeah, you're right,
there's probably no point.

16:55.487 --> 16:57.909
Oh, did I say there was no point?

16:57.995 --> 16:59.572
I don't remember saying those words.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.286
Oh, I just...
I'm getting in my head, then.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.169
Sometimes I do that
thing where I act like

17:03.170 --> 17:05.267
every mistake in the world is my fault.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.770
Yeah, except for this time,

17:06.771 --> 17:08.346
you wouldn't really be that far off.

17:08.347 --> 17:10.148
Although it's like,

17:10.488 --> 17:12.451
I didn't make you
crash the scissor lift.

17:12.452 --> 17:13.990
- No, no.
- Uh-uh.

17:14.488 --> 17:17.087
But technically, I wouldn't
have been on the scissor lift

17:17.088 --> 17:19.079
if you hadn't messed up the signs.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.772
I know, and then it's like, technically,

17:21.773 --> 17:24.127
I wouldn't have even
been hanging the signs at all

17:24.127 --> 17:27.346
if Saint Patrick hadn't driven
the snakes out of Ireland, so...

17:27.842 --> 17:29.296
How far back do we go?

17:29.660 --> 17:30.465
Um...

17:31.164 --> 17:33.211
probably somewhere
between the fifth century

17:33.297 --> 17:34.898
and this morning, I'm guessing.

17:34.899 --> 17:36.959
Right, yeah.

17:37.286 --> 17:37.901
Right.

17:43.923 --> 17:45.786
I can't take this safety
training anymore.

17:45.787 --> 17:47.228
Hey, I get it. It's tough,

17:47.229 --> 17:48.552
especially when you get to your age.

17:48.554 --> 17:49.559
Do you feel like you can't keep up?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.233
No, I mean I'm over taking
the blame for Kelly's mistake.

17:52.235 --> 17:54.223
Well, let's tell Glenn
the truth and bury this chick!

17:54.224 --> 17:57.480
Yeah, but I can't just,
like, throw her under the bus.

17:57.691 --> 17:59.498
Are you sure?
'Cause I have security footage

17:59.499 --> 18:01.695
of her hanging the sign.
It wouldn't be hard.

18:01.696 --> 18:04.817
Yes, but morally...

18:05.138 --> 18:07.035
Although, you know,
it's not like she would

18:07.036 --> 18:08.780
get in that much trouble, right?

18:08.781 --> 18:10.643
And all we'd be doing
is telling the truth.

18:10.644 --> 18:12.609
So if anything, lying in the first place

18:12.695 --> 18:14.494
was the wrong thing to do, right?

18:14.530 --> 18:15.599
You'd already made up
your mind about this

18:15.600 --> 18:17.194
before you even
came in here, hadn't you?

18:17.195 --> 18:19.866
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
you could show the footage

18:19.952 --> 18:21.585
while I tried to stop you
so it'd look like

18:21.670 --> 18:23.453
my hands were clean.
I told everyone to meet,

18:23.539 --> 18:25.382
- like, around 3:00?
- Nice.

18:27.838 --> 18:28.925
She's growing up.

18:32.426 --> 18:34.443
No, uh-uh, I can't do it.

18:34.883 --> 18:37.083
I can't. I still know it's coming.

18:37.771 --> 18:39.032
And to be honest...

18:39.555 --> 18:40.976
you're freaking me out.

18:41.357 --> 18:42.856
You know what? I feel you.

18:42.891 --> 18:44.608
So here's what we're gonna do.

18:44.693 --> 18:47.705
It's not gonna come today,
not even this week.

18:47.980 --> 18:50.291
Months will go by.
You'll forget all about it.

18:50.408 --> 18:52.403
And then one day, out of the blue...

18:54.403 --> 18:56.737
- You're rich.
- I don't know if that...

18:56.822 --> 18:59.094
Even if you tell me
you want to call it off,

18:59.523 --> 19:01.610
I'll say okay, but I'll know
you don't really want that.

19:01.611 --> 19:04.494
You're just trying to make
yourself forget it's coming.

19:04.517 --> 19:06.518
It'll never really be called off, ever.

19:07.434 --> 19:10.268
That's how much I care
about getting you this money.

19:12.755 --> 19:16.006
Mateo, I'm not stupid.

19:16.091 --> 19:18.765
- I know why you're doing this.
- You do?

19:18.766 --> 19:20.894
Yeah, why waste an opportunity

19:20.929 --> 19:23.680
to make me look incompetent
in front of my bosses, right?

19:23.766 --> 19:26.850
Oh. I mean no, that's not what...

19:26.935 --> 19:29.903
Okay, well, you may hate me,
but I still care about you.

19:29.938 --> 19:32.770
So there. 10 grand. You're welcome.

19:33.942 --> 19:35.859
$10,000? I thought it was $50,000.

19:35.944 --> 19:38.161
Doesn't matter. Okay...

19:38.247 --> 19:40.597
- Jeff, I don't want this.
- Well, you're taking it.

19:40.598 --> 19:42.582
I'm faxing the paperwork
to legal right now.

19:42.618 --> 19:45.400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
you can't... you can't do that.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.447
Why not?

19:47.589 --> 19:50.006
- It's complicated.
- I was in love with you.

19:50.092 --> 19:51.925
And you dumped me out of the blue,

19:51.960 --> 19:54.198
so unless there's some reason
I just can't get my...

19:54.199 --> 19:55.641
I'm undocumented!

19:58.423 --> 20:00.340
That's why I couldn't transfer stores.

20:00.469 --> 20:01.897
That's why I can't take the money.

20:01.898 --> 20:03.220
And that's why I couldn't go

20:03.305 --> 20:05.605
on a Carnival cruise with your family.

20:05.641 --> 20:06.669
But also, like...

20:07.152 --> 20:08.392
cruises are gross.

20:09.812 --> 20:11.025
So wait.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.205
I never hated you.

20:16.151 --> 20:17.984
I thought it'd be helpful
for us all to watch

20:18.070 --> 20:19.903
the surveillance footage
of Amy hanging the sign

20:19.988 --> 20:22.370
that fell on Mateo so we
can learn what not to do.

20:22.371 --> 20:24.361
- Wait, what?
- No, I don't think

20:24.362 --> 20:25.826
we need to watch this video, Dina.

20:25.828 --> 20:27.769
- Well, I do.
- So we are.

20:28.997 --> 20:31.272
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what else to do.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.136
Um, that's the wrong file.

20:34.503 --> 20:35.719
That's from Glenn's mullet phase.

20:35.804 --> 20:37.304
That was, like, four years ago.

20:37.372 --> 20:39.973
I can't stand this new system.
I can't find anything.

20:40.025 --> 20:41.808
Whoa, is that from the tornado?

20:41.860 --> 20:43.860
- Oh, uh, you know what...
- Uh, Dina,

20:43.946 --> 20:45.295
can you turn off the video, please?

20:45.296 --> 20:46.773
No, Amy, it's not your decision.

20:46.775 --> 20:48.118
No, I'm not kidding. Turn off the video.

20:48.119 --> 20:49.270
Hey, what are you doing? Step back.

20:49.271 --> 20:50.457
This is very sensitive equipment!

20:50.458 --> 20:51.734
Dina, turn off the video!

20:51.735 --> 20:53.156
- Stop the video!
- What are you doing?

20:53.157 --> 20:55.523
Whoa!

21:03.465 --> 21:05.682
I think everyone knows you like Jonah.

21:06.647 --> 21:07.502
Mm-hmm.

21:08.305 --> 21:14.757
