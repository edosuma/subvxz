00:01.300 --> 00:03.768
An hour ago, I resigned as
State's Attorney of Cook County.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.665
REPORTER:
Are you still involved
with prostitutes, sir?

00:05.700 --> 00:08.089
PETER:
Thanks for playing
the breadwinner for a while.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.664
It's not gonna last forever.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.564
ALICIA:
I just wanted to say thank you
for the opportunity.

00:11.610 --> 00:12.736
Glad you could come aboard.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.407
DIANE: _
Not only are you coming back

00:14.440 --> 00:15.771
to the workplace fairly late,

00:15.810 --> 00:17.402
but you have some
very prominent baggage.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.270
But, hey, if she can do it,
so can you.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.572
Kalinda Sharma.
Oh, the investigator.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.542
You're Peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.546
ALICIA:
Last time I was in court
was 13 years ago.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.581
Wow, I was 12.

00:29.590 --> 00:30.727
(both laugh)

00:30.760 --> 00:33.354
State's attorney's here.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.492
I'm Glenn Childs.

00:34.530 --> 00:35.792
Peter blames me
for his downfall.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.468
Don't make yourself
collateral damage here.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.819
ALICIA:
The day you leaked
that sex tape

00:38.870 --> 00:41.737
to the press and forced me
to shield my children,

00:41.770 --> 00:43.704
that was the day I became
collateral damage.

00:43.740 --> 00:46.675
You've obviously never made
a woman angry before.

00:52.850 --> 01:03.829
(sighing)

01:03.860 --> 01:06.829
An hour ago, I resigned as
State's Attorney of Cook County.

01:06.860 --> 01:09.658
But I do admit
to a failure ofjudgment

01:09.700 --> 01:12.237
in my dealings
with these women.

01:12.270 --> 01:13.760
I've never abused my office

01:13.800 --> 01:14.835
for sexual favors.

01:16.810 --> 01:20.632
Give us time to heal and
rebuild their trust... trust...

01:26.150 --> 01:28.573
(alarm clock beeps)

01:28.620 --> 01:30.611
GRACE (in distance):
Mom, breakfast.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.627
CARY:
Oh, hey, congratulations.

01:38.660 --> 01:39.888
That's great. Your husband's
appeal-- it looks like

01:39.930 --> 01:41.898
he could get out of prison
any month now, huh?

01:41.930 --> 01:43.818
Looks like it.
Early Show had a story on it.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.598
Some good stuff on you, too.

01:44.630 --> 01:46.439
Did you catch it?
No, missed it.

01:46.470 --> 01:47.539
Yeah, I caught it online.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.208
I can send you the link.
That's okay.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.175
No, no, no, it's easy.

01:52.210 --> 01:54.235
So Litigation wants me
on this new class action.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.235
That's where I'm headed.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.247
What about you?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.145
Oh, I don't know.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.640
Oh, in here, I guess.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.524
_ DIANE: _
When did you say this was?

02:10.560 --> 02:13.757
May 15, four
months ago.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.324
WILL:
Do you have anything
with the date?

02:15.360 --> 02:16.622
WOMAN:
A parking receipt.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.434
DIANE:
Had you ever met
Mr. McKeon before?

02:19.470 --> 02:21.836
No.

02:21.870 --> 02:24.634
I'd seen his
family on the news.

02:24.670 --> 02:27.673
I heard about their hotels and
stuff, but that's about it.

02:27.710 --> 02:29.371
WILL:
Well, the problem
here, Christy,

02:29.410 --> 02:31.549
is that any civil suit

02:31.580 --> 02:33.172
could be seen as...

02:34.220 --> 02:35.346
...opportunistic.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.847
CHRISTY:
Because of their money?

02:38.890 --> 02:39.754
Yes.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.849
I'm sorry,

02:41.890 --> 02:43.881
but I didn't choose my rapist.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.352
DIANE:
This kid doesn't know
what she's in for.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.367
Taking on the
McKeon family...

02:49.400 --> 02:50.662
Alicia, if you don't mind,

02:50.700 --> 02:52.588
we just need to...
No, it's all
right, stay.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.789
WILL:
I don't know about this.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.933
It's a criminal case,
not a civil one.

02:55.970 --> 02:57.369
Except the new
State's Attorney

02:57.410 --> 02:58.729
rejected the charges.

02:58.770 --> 02:59.873
Yeah, because it's got

02:59.910 --> 03:01.377
Duke lacrosse_
written all over It.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.342
Oh, come on.

03:02.380 --> 03:03.347
What come on?

03:03.380 --> 03:04.574
Put your politics aside, Diane.

03:04.610 --> 03:05.907
You're Glenn Childs,
you get this

03:05.950 --> 03:07.372
dropped in your lap-- a stripper

03:07.420 --> 03:08.648
at a bachelor party

03:08.680 --> 03:10.386
accusing the son
of the most powerful family

03:10.420 --> 03:11.887
in Chicago of rape--
and you don't think

03:11.920 --> 03:13.285
it's Duke lacrosse II?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.379
He's worried about
the McKeon family money.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.456
_ He's worried about _
their campaign contributions.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.856
Well, I'm worried that
we're overextended.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.322
How many Sheffrin-Marks depos
do we have left?

03:21.360 --> 03:22.861
210.
210.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.561
We need to keep
our eye on the ball.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.261
And Christy is just gonna
look like she's trying

03:26.300 --> 03:27.961
to make some quick cash
from the McKeon family.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.864
Do you believe her?

03:28.900 --> 03:30.538
I believe a lot of things

03:30.570 --> 03:31.559
I can't prove.

03:34.010 --> 03:35.671
All right,

03:35.710 --> 03:36.870
here's what I think.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.901
I know the McKeon family lavwer.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.542
Ericcson?
Right,

03:40.580 --> 03:41.717
William Ericcson.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.012
That's just what we need--
two Wills.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.984
The McKeons are gonna
want to keep this out of

03:45.020 --> 03:46.556
the press,
even if he didn't do it.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.319
So my guess is
they throw her some cash,

03:48.360 --> 03:49.918
maybe 50 grand or so
to keep her quiet.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.890
Hmm, yeah.

03:55.900 --> 03:59.336
(dialing phone)

04:00.970 --> 04:03.859
Mr. Ericcson, please.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.038
Tell him it's the other Will.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.707
I want you to be
at this lunch.

04:08.740 --> 04:09.707
Don't say anything.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.604
Just listen
and look serious.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.948
I can do that.

04:13.980 --> 04:15.447
How you holding up here?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.482
I'm holding up.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.456
Oh, yeah, how
do you know her?

04:21.490 --> 04:23.788
VVho?

04:23.830 --> 04:24.751
Christy.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.496
I don't.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.418
Then why did she ask for you
to be on the case?

04:30.970 --> 04:32.460
I don't know.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.797
Ericcson here.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.296
Will.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.365
Will.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.332
I think you know
why I'm calling.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.018
Two months ago,
Peter Florrick was sentenced

04:59.060 --> 05:01.620
to ten years for bribery
and corruption.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.060
Today was the ﬁrst step
toward his release.

05:04.100 --> 05:07.467
REPORTER:
He was known in Chicago
simply as "The Hammer."

05:07.500 --> 05:11.368
He jailed cop-killers,
CEOs, corrupt politicians,

05:11.410 --> 05:13.378
until "The Hammer"
got hammered.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.106
An hour ago, I resigned as
State's Attorney of Cook County.

05:16.140 --> 05:19.519
REPORTER:
Within weeks, Chicago's
incorruptible State's Attorney

05:19.550 --> 05:20.972
found himself
with all the trappings

05:21.020 --> 05:23.011
of a modern American scandal:

05:23.050 --> 05:26.019
A rival with an eye on his job,
an embarrassed wife,

05:26.050 --> 05:29.019
a blushing call girl
and an R-rated sex tape.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.823
AMBER:
Does she do this for you?

05:30.860 --> 05:32.418
Does she?

05:32.460 --> 05:35.588
PETER:
Oh, God, please. You are ama...

05:35.630 --> 05:37.461
Hey, ever heard
the whole thing?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.058
No.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.034
You're the only one who hasn't.

05:41.070 --> 05:42.662
Everything I
have on McKeon.

05:46.710 --> 05:47.677
MAN:
What?!

05:47.710 --> 05:50.099
I beat you three
sets to two.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.640
Oh, come on,
you don't even believe that.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.977
(chuckles)

05:53.020 --> 05:54.112
This is driving me crazy.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.447
How do I know you?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.118
Me?

05:57.150 --> 05:58.788
Miner, Parsons & Layton?

05:58.820 --> 06:00.082
(elegant piano music plays)

06:00.120 --> 06:02.759
Alicia is actually
our newest junior associate.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.782
One month in.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.058
Will Ericcson,
Alicia Florrick.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.091
Well, it is very nice
to meet you,

06:09.130 --> 06:10.961
Mrs. Florrick.
You, too.

06:11.000 --> 06:11.921
I'm rooting for your husband.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.165
I know he has a lot
of enemies in this town,

06:14.200 --> 06:15.462
but I always root
for the underdog.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.467
(chuckles)

06:16.510 --> 06:18.034
Oh, just ignore him.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.174
The only reason someone's
forced out of public office

06:20.210 --> 06:21.871
in America these days is sex.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.970
So let's talk about
Lloyd McKeon.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.149
It's so sad, really.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.910
I remember when you had
a respectable firm, Will.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.589
One that wouldn't_ sink to
scurrilous charges like these.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.919
And what charges
might those be, Will?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.655
I haven't said anything yet.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.157
Do you think you're
the first firm

06:39.190 --> 06:41.055
she's shopping
this lawsuit to?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.226
There's nothing there.

06:42.260 --> 06:44.194
Even the State's Attorney--
the new State's Attorney--

06:44.230 --> 06:45.925
thinks there's
nothing there.
And yet

06:45.970 --> 06:48.393
I got you to a settlement lunch
on a half hour's notice.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.764
(chuckles)

06:52.580 --> 06:54.707
Mrs. Florrick,
what would you say

06:54.740 --> 06:57.607
to someone bringing
unsubstantiated sexual charges

06:57.650 --> 07:00.619
against a public figure just
in order to gain an advantage?

07:00.650 --> 07:02.515
You want to know
what I would say?

07:02.550 --> 07:03.710
I would.

07:06.250 --> 07:10.983
I would say you're trying to
change the subject from rape.

07:13.130 --> 07:16.827
Well, I would agree that,
as offensive and misguided

07:16.870 --> 07:18.861
as these charges are, the optics

07:18.900 --> 07:20.197
aren't exactly
in our favor.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.561
So we're willing
to make an offer.

07:31.580 --> 07:32.569
It's nonnegotiable.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.111
You have till end
of business day.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.518
McKeon did it.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.198
Under a hundred thou,
I would've said no.

07:47.230 --> 07:48.549
Over a hundred thou...

07:48.600 --> 07:49.897
What about well over?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.190
If you don't mind my asking,
Ms. Barbosa,

07:56.240 --> 07:57.707
why did you request me?

07:57.740 --> 07:59.230
I saw you on TV.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.999
I thought you'd
understand

08:01.040 --> 08:03.099
what it's like
to be misunderstood.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.869
(door opens)

08:05.910 --> 08:07.241
WILL:
Ladies.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.872
Sorry about that.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.239
McKeon's lawyers made
a financial offer

08:10.290 --> 08:12.178
that Diane and I
actually agree on.

08:12.220 --> 08:13.778
A first.

08:13.820 --> 08:14.980
It's a cash
settlement.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.079
$450,000.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.256
You're kidding.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.848
We don't have to go to court?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.049
He just offered that?

08:21.100 --> 08:23.568
You'll have to sign a standard
confidentiality agreement.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.067
Both parties free
each other of liability

08:25.100 --> 08:27.295
and agree not to speak to
anyone, including the press.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.295
What?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.295
DIANE:
It's standard

08:29.340 --> 08:31.160
in civil agreements.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.303
I want everybody
to know he settled.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.739
Can't we tell the police?

08:34.780 --> 08:37.146
Not if we sign
a confidentiality agreement.

08:37.180 --> 08:40.217
McKeon could withdraw the award
and sue you for defamation.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.911
What do you think?

08:42.750 --> 08:43.910
I think under the cir...

08:43.950 --> 08:44.917
(clears throat)

08:48.790 --> 08:52.123
I think you're looking
for justice, Christy.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.197
And sometimes justice comes
in a form we don't expect.

08:55.230 --> 08:58.199
If you take this money,
the settlement will be known

08:58.230 --> 09:00.937
to the two people
that matter most, you and him.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.709

He'll know how much it costs to

09:09.340 --> 09:12.776
rape somebody and get
away with it, that's all.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.312
She's right.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.679
WIL_L:
Okay, Ericcson,

09:21.720 --> 09:23.654
how flexible are you
on confidentiality?

09:23.690 --> 09:25.021
_ Exclude new
criminal discovery.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.823
Oh, come on, this isn't...

09:26.860 --> 09:28.828
You want to go to court,
is that it?

09:28.860 --> 09:29.895
Take it as far
as pretrial?

09:29.930 --> 09:31.158
He doesn't want
to go to trial.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.792
Look, Ericcson,

09:32.840 --> 09:35.297
you want to make McKeon

09:35.340 --> 09:37.706
the Bachelor
Party Rapist,

09:37.740 --> 09:38.809
be my...

09:38.840 --> 09:41.604
That's how you
want to play it?

09:41.640 --> 09:42.641
(beep)

09:46.880 --> 09:48.677
We just turned down
a half million bucks.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.846
Feels good,
doesn't it?

09:52.690 --> 09:54.954
Looks like we got a case.

09:54.990 --> 09:58.983
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

10:11.940 --> 10:14.704
You have to size these things up
pretty quickly.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.743
12 clients, stockbroker types,
no one out of control.

10:17.780 --> 10:18.872
It was easy.

10:18.910 --> 10:23.040
They paid $400 for a 90-minute,
two-girl fantasy strip.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.239
Two girl?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.643
Who was the other girl?

10:25.690 --> 10:27.282
Maura...

10:27.320 --> 10:28.753
I-I don't remember
her last name.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.257
That was the only time
she worked.

10:30.290 --> 10:31.325
(speaking Spanish)

10:31.360 --> 10:34.022
(speaking Spanish)

10:34.060 --> 10:35.254
Sorry.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.359
She insists on being here
during all this.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.367
It's a nightmare.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.765
KALIN DA:
And McKeon,

10:39.800 --> 10:41.438
how'd you meet him?

10:41.470 --> 10:42.869
The groom?

10:42.910 --> 10:45.060
Hmm.
He offered me
another $100

10:45.110 --> 10:46.168
for a private lap dance.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.872
When I got in the bedroom,
he locked the door.

10:48.910 --> 10:51.378
Then he grabbed me.

10:51.410 --> 10:55.244
I tried to get the mace
from my bag, tried to shout.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.010
Did you tell anyone afterwards?

10:58.050 --> 10:59.381
Maura.

10:59.420 --> 11:00.682
And our driver Grant.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.223
He was the one_
who suggested she drive me

11:03.260 --> 11:04.682
to the hospital
for the rape exam.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.685
KALIN DA:
And the service,

11:05.730 --> 11:06.697
Worldwide Elite,

11:06.730 --> 11:08.288
how long did you work for them?

11:08.330 --> 11:10.389
Two years.
And what else did you do there?

11:10.430 --> 11:12.398
What do you mean?
I mean, what else
did you do there?

11:17.370 --> 11:19.975
For a year, I was an escort.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.704
Didn't you think that might be
important to tell us?

11:23.750 --> 11:27.208
I haven't gone on a call
in a year.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.911
I was in_ _
an abu5ive relationship.

11:28.950 --> 11:30.281
I needed the money

11:30.320 --> 11:31.947
to move out.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.117
When I moved, I stopped working.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.253
But still stripped.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.429
ALICIA:
So what's your point--

11:38.460 --> 11:39.859
a call girl
can't get raped?

11:39.900 --> 11:40.753
Yeah, that's my point,
thanks.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.791
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?

11:42.830 --> 11:44.491
'Cause she walked away from
half a million dollars.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.327
And when did she
ever lie to us?

11:46.370 --> 11:47.496
You know, the more you bond
with these clients,

11:47.540 --> 11:48.495
the less helpful you are.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.303
Your stripper was hooking.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.501
Why is she my stripper
when she does something bad?

11:52.540 --> 11:53.472
(chuckles)

11:53.510 --> 11:57.002
Okay, so the point is
to prepare for trial

11:57.050 --> 11:59.348
so we don't actually
have to go to trial.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.472
Cary, right?

12:00.520 --> 12:01.919
Yes, sir.

12:01.950 --> 12:04.487
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.044
I need you to take

12:06.090 --> 12:08.149
Alicia's Sheffrin-Marks
depos for the week.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.384
All right, I'm on it.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.421
This is settlement poker.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.325
No one wants
to go to trial,

12:12.360 --> 12:14.225
but the person who plays
the better hand

12:14.260 --> 12:15.249
makes the better deal.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.928
So get me some good cards.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.323
WOMAN:
So your first thought is

12:19.370 --> 12:21.190
to come to _
the State Attorney's office?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.060
KALINDA:
I just need one thing.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.463
And why do
I help you, again?

12:24.510 --> 12:25.909
Because you like me.
(laughs)

12:25.940 --> 12:27.009
That still works
with people?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.200
Mm-hmm, like a charm.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.798
You never should
have quit this place.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.944
I didn't quit.
I was fired.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.379
Come on.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.172
You ran a solid rape
investigation.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.211
You should be
dying to slip us

12:38.250 --> 12:40.980
the witness interviews.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.317
Leah,

12:42.360 --> 12:44.328
could you come outside
for a second?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.264
And you're telling me
your husband

12:50.300 --> 12:52.325
had nothing
to do with this?

12:52.370 --> 12:53.894
Mr. Childs, my law
firm is bringing on

12:53.940 --> 12:55.134
a civil action,
that's all.

12:55.170 --> 12:56.535
Designed to embarrass
my office

12:56.570 --> 12:58.800
and make it look like _I don't
care about a rape Victim.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.535
A happy coincidence?

13:01.840 --> 13:04.502
I understand the need
to blame someone

13:04.550 --> 13:06.245
for your husband's downfall,

13:06.280 --> 13:07.918
but I didn't release
that sex tape

13:07.950 --> 13:09.144
to hurt you
or your family.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.386
I have kids, too.

13:10.420 --> 13:13.150
And you should know
I was holding back.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.317
I had more to release
about your husband,

13:15.360 --> 13:16.315
a lot more.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.453
Disturbing things,

13:18.490 --> 13:21.596
but out of compassion,
I held back.

13:21.630 --> 13:24.224
Mr. Childs, if you have
something to show me,

13:24.270 --> 13:25.828
just do it, okay?

13:25.870 --> 13:28.065
'Cause the one thing
I don't have time for

13:28.100 --> 13:29.465
these days is empty threats.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.899
You want something

13:30.940 --> 13:33.909
on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.004
I liked Christy.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.574
She was one of
my best dancers.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.542
But I have nothing
else to add.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.616
I'm sorry.

13:44.650 --> 13:46.242
We just need
contact information.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.279
That's all, Ms. Avarski,

13:47.320 --> 13:48.548
for the driver
and the stripper.

13:48.590 --> 13:49.579
Dancer.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.951
Look, I would love...

13:50.990 --> 13:51.922
Because we'd really hate

13:51.960 --> 13:54.952
to subpoena your books
and client records.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.264
You're East Indian?

13:57.300 --> 13:57.823
Yeah.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.861
Hmm, it's very popular

13:59.900 --> 14:01.629
these days.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.501
Contact information?

14:03.540 --> 14:04.564
Follow me.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.541
Why A-B-C?

14:13.580 --> 14:15.571
$1,500 an hour,

14:15.620 --> 14:17.542
$2,100 and, uh,

14:17.590 --> 14:18.909
$3,100.

14:20.590 --> 14:24.287
What makes someone
more expenswe?

14:24.330 --> 14:26.992
Is this about the rape?

14:27.030 --> 14:28.224
No.

14:28.260 --> 14:30.399
Regular clients

14:30.430 --> 14:32.625
and special requests.

14:32.670 --> 14:34.490
Requests?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.189
No condoms

14:36.240 --> 14:39.061
or being dominated
or role-playing.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.601
Whatever they
can't get at home.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.178
People would really pay
$3,000 an hour?

14:45.210 --> 14:46.507
The day rate is

14:46.550 --> 14:48.871
$31,000, dawn to dawn.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.315
So about this rape, can you get
me contact information

14:55.360 --> 14:57.089
on this dancer?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.621
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.

14:59.660 --> 15:00.649
Left a fake number,

15:00.700 --> 15:03.123
fake address,
fake social.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.468
Happens all the time.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.264
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?

15:10.170 --> 15:12.263
ZACH:
So, Mom, where are you, anyway?

15:12.310 --> 15:13.572
Look, I have to work late
tonight.

15:13.610 --> 15:16.033
Can you ask Grandma if she can
stay till 10:00?

15:16.080 --> 15:17.399
Sure.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.702
Grandma,
can you stay till 10:00?

15:19.750 --> 15:20.944
Mom's working late.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.413
No need to shout, dear.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.315
If she has to,
she has to.

15:24.350 --> 15:25.510
Grandma can stay.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.359
So, Mom, I was talking
to Grandma,

15:27.390 --> 15:28.516
and she said she visited Dad

15:28.560 --> 15:30.949
this weekend, and he was saying

15:30.990 --> 15:32.457
how much he missed us.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.526
(hip-hop blaring)
Grandma said that?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.529
I was thinking maybe
we should be going there.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.322
You know, visiting him?

15:39.370 --> 15:42.635
Your dad didn't want you
to see him like that in prison.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.604
He was...

15:44.640 --> 15:46.631
He didn't want you to worry.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.332
But let me ask him-- maybe
he's changed his mind, okay?

15:49.380 --> 15:50.574
Right.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.976
(doorbell rings)

16:00.660 --> 16:03.379
We'll talk about it
when I get home tonight, okay?

16:03.430 --> 16:05.648
All right, see you tonight.

16:10.770 --> 16:14.490
JACKIE: I trust you're
doing your homework.

16:18.710 --> 16:22.009
(hip-hop plays)

16:22.040 --> 16:23.644
Five minutes.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.739
We understand you can
corroborate Christy's story.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.771
Which was?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.742
That she told you about the rape
right after it happened.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.543
Look, I like Christy,
she's a good tipper,

16:31.590 --> 16:33.717
but when she drinks,
she doesn't know what the hell

16:33.760 --> 16:35.182
she's talking about.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.756
But you do?

16:36.790 --> 16:38.280
Christy gave the guy
a lap dance,

16:38.330 --> 16:39.456
he paid her, we went home.

16:39.490 --> 16:40.798
Nobody said anything
about any rape.

16:40.830 --> 16:42.195
I don't blame
Christy for trying

16:42.230 --> 16:43.492
to get extra money
out of McKeon,

16:43.530 --> 16:45.088
but, hey, she's lying.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.505
Is that Dad?

16:52.540 --> 16:54.337
I don't know.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.405
But you're thinking it, too.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.375
JACKIE:
Gonna need your help
in a minute.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.088
Dad told us he made mistakes.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.714
Yeah, but not that.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.611
Do we tell Mom?

17:09.660 --> 17:10.820
They sent them to Mom

17:10.860 --> 17:12.555
to hurt her.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.558
So I say no.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.831
So?

17:28.880 --> 17:30.700
I don't know.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.139
Do they want
to see me?

17:33.180 --> 17:35.478
Oh, Zach does,
but Grace doesn't?

17:35.520 --> 17:36.839
She's hurt.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.280
She thought
you were everything.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.658
So two months in,
you seem well.

17:45.690 --> 17:49.296
I am. Some
good guys here.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.525
There's probably
less backstabbing

17:51.570 --> 17:53.731
than the state
attorney's office.

17:55.170 --> 17:57.161
You look good.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.770
It's like it
agrees with you.

18:03.910 --> 18:07.141
So, here's the thing
about Childs.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.546
Everything he does is a
political calculation.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.888
Everything he says...
Peter, no.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.115
I don't want to be used.

18:15.190 --> 18:16.851
Alicia, I know you
don't believe me,

18:16.890 --> 18:17.879
but Childs set me up.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.592
And if what I give you
can help a rape victim,

18:20.630 --> 18:22.257
what's wrong with that?

18:22.300 --> 18:25.690
How do you know
she's a rape victim, Peter?

18:25.730 --> 18:27.163
I didn't tell your mom.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.394
Daniel told me.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.238
Your appellate lawyer?

18:31.270 --> 18:33.204
He's the one who
referred Christy to you.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.434
What's wrong?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.278
I'm hard-pressed
to think what's not wrong.

18:37.310 --> 18:39.244
So he what...?

18:39.280 --> 18:40.645
Well...

18:40.680 --> 18:43.285
I mentioned
to Daniel

18:43.320 --> 18:44.912
that you were
with Stern, Lockhart,

18:44.950 --> 18:47.418
and that if he didn't have time
for Christy's case

18:47.460 --> 18:49.189
that maybe you would.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.653
I thought you'd want the work.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.453
You thought it was a good idea

18:52.490 --> 18:54.856
to send me a hooker
to represent?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.562
No, I thought it was a good idea
to send you a rape victim.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.699
Oh, my God.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.379
You had sex with her.

19:07.410 --> 19:10.208
What?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.172
You're using her first name,
Peter.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.644
You're saying "Christy."

19:14.680 --> 19:16.318
She's one of your whores.

19:16.350 --> 19:19.444
Oh, Alicia,
would you stop it?

19:19.490 --> 19:21.958
When are you gonna
stop thinking that I
slept with everyone?

19:21.990 --> 19:26.450
When are you gonna forgive
me, for God's sake?

19:26.490 --> 19:27.957
How much did you spend on Amber?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.729
You had sex with her, what,

19:29.760 --> 19:32.297
ten times, 20 times?

19:32.330 --> 19:35.766
You don't want to know
the details of what I did.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.233
If you want me to forgive you,

19:37.270 --> 19:39.238
I need to know
what I'm forgiving you for.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.807
So at $3,000 a pop,
that's, what, $60,000?

19:41.840 --> 19:45.344
Did you pay her not to use
a condom? Was that extra?

19:45.380 --> 19:47.268
(mutters)

19:47.320 --> 19:50.414
Your trip to Houston,
did you take her with you?

19:50.450 --> 19:51.678
You know I didn't.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.257
I don't know what I know.

19:59.360 --> 20:04.821
(voice breaking): Grace's 12th
birthday party, you s...

20:04.870 --> 20:07.259
you said you had to leave early.

20:07.300 --> 20:11.509
Where did you go, Peter?

20:11.540 --> 20:14.577
You answer those questions,
and then we will talk

20:14.610 --> 20:16.237
about forgiveness.

20:19.650 --> 20:20.947
This is a pretrial hearing,

20:20.980 --> 20:22.447
so don't worry about
the driver yet.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.880
We just need to win
a few motions.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.387
Sorry!

20:26.420 --> 20:27.182
Don't worry about it.

20:27.220 --> 20:29.484
It all comes down
to the rape kit.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.023
KALINDA:
Still no luck finding
the other stripper.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.755
_ _ All we have
is a first name, "Maura,"

20:33.800 --> 20:35.290
and a general
description.

20:35.330 --> 20:36.592
We need to box McKeon in.

20:36.630 --> 20:38.495
There's only one of two ways

20:38.530 --> 20:40.361
his semen ends up
in that rape kit:

20:40.400 --> 20:42.334
consensual SEX 0|” rape.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.838
We get him to swear there
was no consensual sex.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.406
Why would he do that?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.704
'Cause he has a wife.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.402
There you are.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.701
How you doing?

20:52.750 --> 20:53.944
You nervous?

20:53.980 --> 20:56.642
No, but maybe
I should be.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.580
WILL: This is just a
pretrial hearing.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.713
State's attorney's trying
to squash our subpoena,

21:00.760 --> 21:02.785
so today we just get
the ground rules

21:02.820 --> 21:04.378
straight, in case this
thing goes to trial.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.751
Kalinda, I need you
to get upstairs, get in

21:06.790 --> 21:08.826
the State's Attorney's office
and wait for the subpoena.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.327
I'll do that.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.689
What? You don't have to.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.539
I know.
I'll be back.

21:13.570 --> 21:14.389
You all right?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.829
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.

21:21.610 --> 21:23.305
Oh, my God,
this is too good.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.648
We got Judge Abernathy.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.046
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal,

21:28.080 --> 21:30.685
he makes Michael Moore
look like Rush Limbaugh.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.609
Justice may be blind,
but judges sure aren't.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.548
God, Ericcson must be
pulling his hair out.

21:36.590 --> 21:39.559
BAILIFF:
All rise for Judge Abernathy.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.956
Oh, please, don't stand.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.026
Everybody sit back down, please.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.789
We've got the big room here,
don't we?

21:47.840 --> 21:51.105
Your Honor, given the stature
of my client, Mr. McKeon,

21:51.140 --> 21:53.062
and given the fact
that this pretrial

21:53.110 --> 21:54.407
hearing has already
garnered the attention

21:54.440 --> 21:55.771
of our friends in the press,

21:55.810 --> 21:57.778
we would ask the court to
seal the pretrial filings

21:57.810 --> 21:59.471
and avoid a show trial.

21:59.510 --> 22:01.842
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think
we need to do all that.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.485
Do we? First Amendment
issues and all?

22:04.520 --> 22:06.784
I deny the petition with regret.

22:06.820 --> 22:08.651
Mr. Gardner?

22:08.690 --> 22:10.829
Yes, Your Honor.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.521
We have a lot of testimony

22:12.560 --> 22:14.494
focusing on whether
there was a consensual act

22:14.530 --> 22:15.849
between Mr. McKeon

22:15.900 --> 22:17.765
and my client,
but if Mr. McKeon

22:17.800 --> 22:19.097
is willing to stipulate

22:19.130 --> 22:20.791
there was, indeed, a
consensual sexual act,

22:20.840 --> 22:22.660
we would forego
this testimony.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.861
That's a good point. Mr.
Ericcson, how do you respond?

22:24.910 --> 22:27.777
We will stipulate there
was no sex of any kind,

22:27.810 --> 22:28.902
forced or consensual,
Your Honor.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.602
The plaintiff also requests an
expedited trial date,

22:31.650 --> 22:33.618
Your Honor,
a DNA sample from Mr. McKeon,

22:33.650 --> 22:36.369
DNA results from the rape kit,
and the investigative reports

22:36.420 --> 22:38.115
from the State's
Attorney's office.

22:38.150 --> 22:40.414
They have been...
reluctant to furnish them.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.429
Thank you, counselor.
I will grant all four motions.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.621
Mr., uh... Ericcson?

22:45.660 --> 22:49.551
Ah. I interpret from
Mr. Ericcson's, uh, gesture

22:49.600 --> 22:50.760
that he acquiesces.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.963
Well, I'll see
you all back here...

22:54.000 --> 22:56.389
Let's see. My docket is clear.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.702
Five days?

22:57.740 --> 22:59.901
How's that for expedited?

22:59.940 --> 23:05.003
Uh, as a side note, I would like
to ask for a moment of silence

23:05.050 --> 23:08.918
for the recent mass killings
in Darfur.

23:14.090 --> 23:16.149
Okay, thank you.

23:16.190 --> 23:17.418
Court adjourned.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.497
That was a great start, huh?

23:23.530 --> 23:24.929
I understand you're having
trouble with the driver.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.767
And you're boxed in
on the rape kit.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.438
You should just
settle on our terms.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.768
ERICCSON:
Yeah, right. See you in trial.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.732
May 15, four months ago.

23:32.770 --> 23:35.500
This one seemed cool.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.474
Hey. So you know Will?

23:37.510 --> 23:39.876
12 clients, stockbroker types.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.616
Mr. Gardner.
You two went to school together?

23:41.650 --> 23:43.709
That's what they were saying
the other night at drinks.

23:43.750 --> 23:44.887
Yeah.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.080
So that's why?

23:46.120 --> 23:49.214
Cary, if you don't mind, I've
had only a week with this.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.784
You got an expedited trial date

23:50.830 --> 23:52.582
to force the other
side to settle,

23:52.630 --> 23:54.188
and now you guys are
the ones suffering.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.720
What are you looking for?

23:55.760 --> 23:57.728
"TZK Industries."

23:57.770 --> 23:59.590
I... I've seen it somewhere
before.

23:59.630 --> 24:01.769
What is TZK Industries?

24:01.800 --> 24:04.030
"TZK Industries."

24:09.580 --> 24:10.706
It's a furniture
supply company.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.547
"Supplying elegant furniture

24:12.580 --> 24:14.616
to home and business."
Why? What do you need?

24:14.650 --> 24:17.539
Something to undercut
Christy's driver.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.581
Okay.

24:21.820 --> 24:23.481
Oh.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.122
It can't be that easy, can it?

24:25.160 --> 24:27.219
What?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.218
So I find this
odd, Mr. Grant.

24:31.270 --> 24:34.728
You were there, and you say
there was no rape?

24:34.770 --> 24:37.739
So either you're lying

24:37.770 --> 24:39.499
or my client's lying.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.871
All I know is what I saw.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.201
Your Honor, request permission
to approach the witness.

24:47.250 --> 24:50.242
Yes. Please. Approach.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.078
Mr. Grant, this is a copy
of your wife's W-2.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.281
Could you read the name
of your wife's employer, please?

24:55.320 --> 25:00.280
"TZK Industries."

25:00.330 --> 25:02.195
WILL:
_And TZK Industries
is a company owned

25:02.230 --> 25:04.164
by the McKeon family
to supply furniture

25:04.200 --> 25:05.724
to their properties.
Objection. Not in evidence.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.897
Well, I think it's all right
for it to be asked,

25:07.940 --> 25:09.089
Mr. Ericcson.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.529
I... Actually, sustained.

25:11.570 --> 25:14.607
Your Honor,
you sustained the objection?

25:14.640 --> 25:16.505
I did. Mr. Ericcson had a point.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.813
Isn't it an amazing coincidence,
Mr. Grant,

25:23.850 --> 25:25.886
that after a year
of unemployment,

25:25.920 --> 25:28.980
your wife got a job in June from
the McKeon family,

25:29.020 --> 25:31.056
a month after the
bachelor party incident?
No.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.318
And why is that, Mr. Grant?

25:32.360 --> 25:35.625
Because my wife and I
are divorced.

25:37.060 --> 25:39.324
My wife and I have been
separated for a year now,

25:39.370 --> 25:41.065
so her getting this job
has nothing to do with me.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.631
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit

25:44.670 --> 25:47.230
even if only in the form
of lowered spousal support?

25:47.270 --> 25:51.001
I guess, but I'm
not Warren Buffett.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.245
(sparse chuckling)

25:54.950 --> 25:56.838
No further questions,
Your Honor.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.885
I'm sorry. I
didn't see it.

26:04.930 --> 26:08.752
Don't ever let your first chair
get undercut like that again.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.623
Good news?

26:12.670 --> 26:14.934
I just got
the rape kit results.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.892
State's Attorney
wasn't stonewalling.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.636
They sent it out to a commercial
lab and just got it back.

26:19.670 --> 26:20.807
And?

26:20.840 --> 26:22.705
It's not McKeon's DNA.

26:35.390 --> 26:38.279
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.218
It's not
McKeon's DNA.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.125
Grant says you're lying.
McKeon says you're lying.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.765
I'm not lying. I...

26:44.800 --> 26:46.290
It's really not his sperm?

26:46.330 --> 26:47.490
Christy, we need
to get the full--

26:47.530 --> 26:50.135
Who else did you have
sex with that night?
No one. I swear.

26:50.170 --> 26:52.263
Well, you obviously
had sex with someone

26:52.310 --> 26:53.129
because it isn't his sperm.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.377
So, was it a boyfriend
or another client?

26:55.410 --> 26:56.775
You need to find Maura.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.300
We can't find Maura.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.716
You really don't
remember anything

27:00.750 --> 27:02.672
that could help us find her?

27:02.720 --> 27:04.039
We didn't talk.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.785
She was on her cell phone

27:05.820 --> 27:08.288
the whole night till
her battery ran out.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.780
I'm sorry.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.286
I need to get to class.

27:21.970 --> 27:24.404
Not that I mind it, but
since when did you become me?

27:24.440 --> 27:26.032
You didn't believe her.
I did.

27:26.070 --> 27:27.435
Maybe she is
telling the truth.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.199
Christy said the
light was flicked out,

27:29.240 --> 27:31.105
so maybe McKeon
was with a friend.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.345
So let's see if the cops
tested the other party-goers.

27:33.380 --> 27:34.711
Worth a try.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.842
It's not just that.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.416
What's up with your bud,
Abernathy?

27:37.450 --> 27:39.281
He's going out of his way
to kill us.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.880
You know how this works.
Liberal judge gets on the bench,

27:41.920 --> 27:43.353
doesn't want to
rule from his bias,

27:43.390 --> 27:44.982
so he bends over
backwards the other way.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.986
I thought you said you
had some pull with him.

27:47.030 --> 27:48.850
He wanted to be on your
Glass Ceiling committee

27:48.900 --> 27:50.197
or whatever it is.
"Emily's List."

27:50.230 --> 27:52.369
Are you suggesting I
influence a sitting judge

27:52.400 --> 27:54.197
in some untoward fashion?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.434
No, just in a toward one.

27:55.470 --> 27:57.335
Come on, come to the
court, let him see

27:57.370 --> 27:58.803
your sad little
liberal face...
(laughing)

27:58.840 --> 28:00.774
and contemplate a life
without his friends.

28:00.810 --> 28:03.472
Will, I'm so sorry.

28:03.510 --> 28:05.102
Don't be.
We're a team.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.141
No apologies.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.291
Hey.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.366
Now what are you doing?
Close the door.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.936
Come on, Zach.
Just let it go.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.403
Would you shut up
and look at this?

28:36.040 --> 28:37.439
See that?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.869
It's called a
"specular highlight."

28:39.910 --> 28:42.515
It's like a light in the eye
reflected in the eye.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.484
See where it is?

28:44.520 --> 28:45.748
It's to the left.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.280
And now, look at this.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.481
The lady's eye. See?

28:49.520 --> 28:50.885
The dot's to the right.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.784
Okay...

28:52.830 --> 28:54.855
They're not in
the same picture.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.460
Dad's face
was Photoshopped into it.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.020
(door closes)

29:00.070 --> 29:02.789
ALICIA:
Hello? Zach, Grace, I'm home.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.328
Jackie, I have
a request to make.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.529
Certainly, dear.

29:10.580 --> 29:14.448
You want the kids to visit
Peter in prison, you talk to me.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.549
You don't talk to Zach.

29:15.580 --> 29:16.945
When did I talk to Zach?

29:16.980 --> 29:18.379
You told him _
Peter was lonely in prison.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.887
Because he is.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.287
Just don't go around me
by talking to my kids.

29:24.990 --> 29:26.389
Hey, Mom.
Hey.

29:26.430 --> 29:27.385
How was work?

29:27.430 --> 29:29.421
It was crappy.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.398
I thought I'd make breakfast.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.067
(laughing):
For dinner?

29:36.100 --> 29:37.431
My goodness.

29:37.470 --> 29:38.937
Like when you were little.

29:38.970 --> 29:42.201
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.242
So, I want to show you some
pictures

29:44.280 --> 29:45.440
of where Dad's staying.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.845
What?

29:49.580 --> 29:51.480
I want to make sure you know
what's involved

29:51.520 --> 29:53.249
with visiting Dad
in prison, okay?

29:54.590 --> 29:55.488
(ringing)

29:57.290 --> 29:59.087
I'll get that.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.529
So, Zach, can you show me how

30:00.560 --> 30:02.448
to get to "Google Images"
on your computer?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.388
Yeah, sure.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.475
What is that?

30:14.510 --> 30:16.933
Nothing. Homework.

30:16.980 --> 30:19.346
GRACE:
Mom!

30:19.380 --> 30:21.371
Someone's here!

30:30.020 --> 30:31.829
Hi. Still no Maura?

30:34.400 --> 30:37.528
KALINDA: DNA is definitely
not from McKeon's semen.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.529
I was going to the crime lab to
see if they ever collected DNA

30:40.570 --> 30:42.891
from the other
party-goers when...

30:42.940 --> 30:44.430
You can watch a little TV.

30:44.470 --> 30:46.028
I'll be right in.

30:48.910 --> 30:49.899
Want to do this later?

30:49.940 --> 30:51.373
No, no, no.

30:51.410 --> 30:55.278
I think I just caught my son
checking out porn.

30:57.450 --> 30:58.587
Aanay. . .

30:58.620 --> 31:00.247
I asked a cop friend

31:00.290 --> 31:02.485
to run the rape kit
results through CODIS.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.226
And they got a hit.

31:04.260 --> 31:07.184
Who, the best man?

31:07.230 --> 31:12.020
Manny Lyons. A rapist serving
20 to life in an Ohio supermax.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.628
I don't understand.

31:13.670 --> 31:14.591
You're in good company.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.460
And he's a convicted rapist.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.502
Christy was raped.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.201
Apparently.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.377
I don't get it.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.605
Was he...

31:23.640 --> 31:24.709
Was he at the party?

31:24.750 --> 31:28.015
Well, as far as I can tell,
he was in a holding cell

31:28.050 --> 31:29.369
in Columbus at the time.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.479
This makes no sense.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.509
We know.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.553
This pile is everything
on the Manny Lyons rape.

31:35.590 --> 31:37.649
This pile,
everything on ours.

31:37.690 --> 31:39.351
And _we _can't find
one thing in common.

31:39.390 --> 31:41.119
No connection with McKeon?

31:41.160 --> 31:42.525
Nope, we checked it.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.666
"Manny Lyons broke into
an Upper Arlington apartment,

31:45.700 --> 31:48.635
"held a knife to the neck of a
40-year-old divorcee,

31:48.670 --> 31:51.230
"raped her, and stole her car.

31:51.270 --> 31:53.704
"He was stopped running
a traffic light ten miles away.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.334
The divorcee identified him
in a six-pack photo line-up."

31:56.380 --> 31:57.631
What?

32:01.620 --> 32:04.987
They do have one thing
in common.

32:08.420 --> 32:13.289
And you were the lab supervisor
who worked on analysis 5795--

32:13.330 --> 32:15.548
the rape kit in this case--
Professor?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.625
Doctor.
Doctor.

32:17.660 --> 32:19.969
And these are your
initials, "GG,"

32:20.000 --> 32:21.695
right at the bottom
of the report?

32:21.740 --> 32:23.332
Yes, those are mine.

32:23.370 --> 32:27.602
Oh, uh, excuse me.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.041
This isn't 5795.
This is 5794.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.672
The Manny Lyons
case. My mistake.

32:32.710 --> 32:35.975
Oh, I see that you ran the
analysis on both cases.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.284
Given the sequential numbering,

32:38.320 --> 32:41.187
I imagine that you worked on
one right after the other?

32:41.220 --> 32:42.517
It appears so.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.256
In both cases, the DNA
matched the same culprit,

32:45.290 --> 32:46.518
Manny Lyons, is that correct?

32:46.560 --> 32:47.584
It is.

32:47.630 --> 32:50.190
So let...

32:50.230 --> 32:51.663
Let me follow
the logic here.

32:51.700 --> 32:52.621
Manny Lyons...

32:52.670 --> 32:54.535
who never set foot in Chicago...

32:54.570 --> 32:56.128
Objection.
Not in evidence.

32:56.170 --> 32:57.694
I will sustain that.

32:57.740 --> 33:00.629
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman,

33:00.670 --> 33:03.707
the only connection between
Manny Lyons and Christy Barbosa

33:03.740 --> 33:05.605
is that you
worked on both cases?

33:05.650 --> 33:07.470
Objection. Argumentative.

33:07.510 --> 33:09.774
Mrs. Florrick, this is not
a debating society.

33:09.820 --> 33:10.775
Sustained.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.481
Dr. Girtzman,

33:12.520 --> 33:13.544
would you say

33:13.590 --> 33:16.457
that the standard of a
commercial lab is relaxed?

33:16.490 --> 33:18.378
No. And, uh, Your Honor,

33:18.430 --> 33:19.624
may I answer

33:19.660 --> 33:21.321
her earlier question?

33:21.360 --> 33:23.123
Personal privilege.
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.

33:23.160 --> 33:27.768
We handle an immense backlog
of untested rape kits

33:27.800 --> 33:30.496
from crime labs
all across the country.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.202
We do so with speed
and professionalism...

33:33.240 --> 33:34.468
And yet isn't it true, sir,

33:34.510 --> 33:35.602
that your lab almost lost

33:35.640 --> 33:37.335
its accreditation in 2005...

33:37.380 --> 33:38.802
Now, that was never proved!
...when it cross-
contaminated

33:38.850 --> 33:39.771
two DNA samples
that were out-sourced

33:39.810 --> 33:42.142
from a crime lab...
This is an old slander!

33:42.180 --> 33:43.317
...that you failed to
sterilize scissors

33:43.350 --> 33:46.444
that then carried the DNA
from one sample to the next?

33:46.490 --> 33:49.414
I don't have to answer this.
Actually, you do, Sir.

33:50.390 --> 33:52.654
Your Honor, given
this testimony,

33:52.690 --> 33:54.624
we move that the rape kit
be reexamined

33:54.660 --> 33:55.797
at a second genetic lab.

33:55.830 --> 33:58.094
ABERNATHY:
I think that is

33:58.130 --> 33:59.688
an understandable request,
Mr. Ericcson.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.836
Your Honor, we would stipulate

34:04.870 --> 34:08.306
that Mrs. Florrick has
proven her case.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.744
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated
the sample...

34:11.780 --> 34:13.600
Excuse me?
But we would
argue, therefore,

34:13.650 --> 34:16.073
that that is the very reason
it cannot be tested again.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.542
You've got to be kidding me.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.241
The very fact that it is
agreed that the sample

34:19.290 --> 34:20.689
is now contaminated means it
can't p055ibly

34:20.720 --> 34:22.119
be tested with any authority.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.752
Your Honor...

34:30.730 --> 34:35.167
Mr. Gardner, you argued that
the rape kit was contaminated.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.428
You can't now

34:36.470 --> 34:37.767
argue it's probative.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.462
The plaintiff's motion
for retesting is denied.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.273
Your Honor...!
Motion is denied.

34:52.790 --> 34:55.258
We've got to find
that other stripper.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.728
So basically this is

35:07.770 --> 35:09.692
a Hail Mary pass?

35:09.740 --> 35:12.538
Look at you with
the sports metaphors.

35:12.570 --> 35:14.879
Yeah, I don't see many
other options here.

35:14.910 --> 35:16.434
Good evening.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.573
Do you have a reservation?

35:18.610 --> 35:21.443
Actually, we have
a... strange request.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.187
We need to get a printout
of a phone bill

35:24.220 --> 35:25.539
from four months ago.

35:25.590 --> 35:26.716
The name?

35:26.750 --> 35:29.218
McKeon.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.724
First name?

35:32.760 --> 35:34.625
Lloyd.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.389
Would you liked that e-mailed
or a hard copy?

35:39.430 --> 35:41.898
Hard copy.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.735
IfI could just see some I.D.,
Mr. McKeon.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.872
Um, well, actually can
I ask you a question--

35:54.920 --> 35:56.171
Rosemary?

35:56.220 --> 35:58.848
There was a bachelor
party here

35:58.890 --> 36:01.882
in May that resulted
in a... a rape.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.581
Were you here then?

36:03.620 --> 36:06.851
I was.

36:06.890 --> 36:09.290
Well, the only person we believe
who can corroborate

36:09.330 --> 36:11.719
the rape victim's story was
using a cell phone that night.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.920
And we're thinking she used
the bathroom phone

36:13.970 --> 36:15.961
when her battery ran out.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.831
We were hoping to glance
at the bill

36:17.870 --> 36:20.361
just to see if there was
a number she dialed.

36:20.410 --> 36:23.834
I'll have to speak
to a manager.

36:25.580 --> 36:28.219
Nice thought.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.343
If all else fails,
try honesty.

36:30.380 --> 36:33.440
I got 20 bucks
on deception.

36:33.490 --> 36:35.253
WOMAN:
Will?

36:35.290 --> 36:36.689
Oh, hey.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.859
What are you doing
north of the Loop?

36:38.890 --> 36:41.996
You know, just seeing
how the other half lives.

36:42.030 --> 36:43.224
Alicia,

36:43.260 --> 36:44.466
this is Marlena.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.524
Nice to meet you.

36:45.570 --> 36:46.491
Hi.

36:46.530 --> 36:47.997
Ask for a view
of the lake.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.237
It's beautiful at night.

36:52.740 --> 36:53.832
She thinks
we're getting a room.

36:53.870 --> 36:55.576
Yep.

36:55.610 --> 36:58.306
Now they all think
we're getting a room.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.478
You worried?
You?

37:04.820 --> 37:06.219
We could do worse.

37:07.620 --> 37:08.917
(clearing throat)

37:08.960 --> 37:10.951
I'm having trouble
getting my manager.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.958
If you could just
wait another minute.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.989
I owe you $20.

37:20.830 --> 37:23.697
Okay, Christy and Maura
arrived at 10:15.

37:23.740 --> 37:26.664
Right there, 11:20.

37:26.710 --> 37:28.632
Out-of-state area code.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.510
Hello. You don't know me...

37:37.550 --> 37:41.714
Were you the other dancer
there that night, Maura?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.648
I was, yes.

37:43.690 --> 37:45.954
And your driver,
Mr. Grant,

37:45.990 --> 37:48.959
what did he tell you after you
took Christy to the hospital?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.764
He told us that the McKeons
were very rich,

37:51.800 --> 37:53.768
and we should all keep
our mouths shut.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.768
WILL: And that's why you went
back home to Michigan?

37:55.800 --> 37:57.597
Yes.

37:57.640 --> 37:58.868
I'm sorry. I was scared.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.003
WILL:
And to reiterate,

38:01.040 --> 38:04.942
Christy told you about the rape
immediately afterward?

38:04.980 --> 38:08.575
Yes. In fact, he

38:08.620 --> 38:10.941
followed her out
into the parking lot

38:10.980 --> 38:13.346
and he said,
"Don't tell anyone.

38:13.390 --> 38:16.757
Just take the money
and shut up."

38:16.790 --> 38:18.826
No further questions,
Your Honor.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.098
Thank you, Alicia.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.903
For... you know.

38:40.150 --> 38:43.313
Christy, I'm just curious.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.542
Where did you meet my husband?

38:50.460 --> 38:52.451
I've never met your husband.

38:55.130 --> 38:57.394
My mistake.

39:02.870 --> 39:05.065
BAILIFF:
All rise for
Judge Abernathy.

39:08.110 --> 39:09.975
ABERNATHY:
Good afternoon.

39:10.010 --> 39:13.377
I have given this case
quite a bit of thought,

39:13.410 --> 39:15.048
as you can imagine.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.140
You have both argued
your case well.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.738
(sighs)

39:19.790 --> 39:23.556
But I find myself judging
in favor of the defendant.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.580
Without a DNA match

39:26.630 --> 39:28.723
to the rape kit,
we have a classic

39:28.760 --> 39:30.091
he-said, she-said;
and as much

39:30.130 --> 39:31.995
as my personal sympathies lie
with the plaintiff,

39:32.030 --> 39:35.693
the evidence does not
warrant a favorable deCI5ion.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.868
Judgment in favor
of the defense.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.744
Are you okay?

39:47.780 --> 39:50.044
No.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.913
I'm sorry.

39:52.950 --> 39:55.418
I believe you.

39:57.560 --> 40:02.099
(reporters clamoring)

40:04.570 --> 40:07.027
This is all I want to say.

40:07.070 --> 40:10.164
I have been falsely accused
by a woman

40:10.200 --> 40:12.760
who wanted nothing more
than a quick payday.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.028
But every year there are
thousands of women

40:15.080 --> 40:17.435
who are abused,

40:17.480 --> 40:20.005
and I don't think we should let
this false accusation...

40:20.050 --> 40:21.176
Mr. McKeon.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.589
You're under arrest for
the rape of Christy Barbosa.

40:24.620 --> 40:25.587
Wha...?

40:25.620 --> 40:28.453
Cuff him.
What?

40:28.490 --> 40:29.559
Is this a joke?
(shouting)

40:31.730 --> 40:35.052
(clamoring voices)

40:44.770 --> 40:48.501
(clamoring continues)

40:55.020 --> 40:57.079
(indistinct voices)

40:57.120 --> 40:59.918
It must be hard
to lose, Mrs. Florrick.

40:59.950 --> 41:02.657
Not if it forces
you to prosecute.

41:02.690 --> 41:05.488
I'm coming out of this with
a criminal case I'll win,

41:05.530 --> 41:07.521
and you're coming out
with a loss.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.754
Nice job.

41:11.930 --> 41:14.490
NEWSCASTER:
Lloyd McKeon was arrested
today for rape,

41:14.540 --> 41:17.259
literally seconds after he was
cleared in a civil case

41:17.300 --> 41:19.109
for the identical crime.

41:19.140 --> 41:21.938
State's Attorney Glenn Childs
took credit for finding

41:21.980 --> 41:23.902
an untainted sample of DNA

41:23.940 --> 41:27.649
that will guarantee McKeon's
conviction in a criminal trial.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.545
Childs denied that McKeon's
arrest was a reaction to...

41:29.580 --> 41:30.911
This is yours?

41:30.950 --> 41:32.178
Yeah.

41:32.220 --> 41:35.087
Is he going to jail?

41:35.120 --> 41:38.578
I think so.

41:38.630 --> 41:41.895
Well, then that's good.

41:41.930 --> 41:44.660
Thanks.

41:44.700 --> 41:47.498
Good night.
Good night.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.931
(door closes)

PETER:
What do you want me to do?

43:03.110 --> 43:06.102
AMBER:
I want you to beg.

43:06.150 --> 43:08.300
Please... oh...
Does she do this for you?

43:08.350 --> 43:11.376
Does she?
Oh, God, please...

43:11.420 --> 43:12.944
PETER:_
You're amazmg...

43:12.990 --> 43:14.617
AMBER:
What do you want me to do?

43:14.660 --> 43:16.651
What do you want me
to do to you?

43:16.690 --> 43:19.250
PETER:
Just... don't... stop.

43:19.290 --> 43:20.848
AMBER:
What'll you give me?

43:20.890 --> 43:24.189
What'll you give
me not to stop?

43:24.230 --> 43:26.619
PETER:
Everything.
