01:24.211 --> 01:26.380
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:34.721 --> 01:36.323
I never enjoy anything.

01:36.348 --> 01:39.201
I'm always waiting
for whatever's next.

01:39.226 --> 01:40.644
I think everyone's like that...

01:40.727 --> 01:42.246
living life in fast forward,

01:42.271 --> 01:43.914
never stopping to
enjoy the moment,

01:43.939 --> 01:46.333
too busy trying to rush
through everything,

01:46.358 --> 01:49.836
so we can get on with what we're really
supposed to be doing with our lives.

01:49.861 --> 01:53.048
I get these flashes of
clarity, brilliant clarity,

01:53.073 --> 01:55.217
where, for a second,
I stop and I think,

01:55.242 --> 01:57.386
"Wait, this is it."

01:57.411 --> 02:00.097
"This is my life. I'd better
slow down and enjoy it,"

02:00.122 --> 02:03.058
"because one day, we're all
going to end up in the ground,"

02:03.083 --> 02:05.335
"and that will be it.
We'll be gone."

02:06.920 --> 02:09.898
So I think we should fuck.

You don't look like you'd
be very good at it anyway,

02:19.308 --> 02:21.994
and I don't want to sit here and listen
to you bumblefuck your way through it.

02:22.019 --> 02:24.204
We both want the same thing,

02:24.229 --> 02:26.957
to go back to your room, have sex,
and never see each other again.

02:26.982 --> 02:28.208
Are you with me?

02:28.233 --> 02:29.668
Is this a trick?

02:29.693 --> 02:31.169
The offer is about to expire.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.629
No, no, I'm in.

02:32.654 --> 02:33.864
I'm definitely in.

02:40.162 --> 02:41.179
Do you like that book?

02:41.204 --> 02:42.889
No, God, no.

02:42.914 --> 02:45.959
No, it's my idiot
brother's favorite book.

02:46.084 --> 02:47.936
- Is it yours?
- No, no.

02:47.961 --> 02:49.379
It's my roommate's.

through the window

04:04.579 --> 04:06.515
into my ex-wife's
new life,

04:06.540 --> 04:09.393
I was overcome by the
oddest sensation.

04:09.418 --> 04:12.896
Watching her with this man was
like turning on a familiar sitcom

04:12.921 --> 04:17.149
and realizing they had replaced one
of the lead actors with a stranger.

04:17.175 --> 04:20.278

04:20.303 --> 04:23.365

have to go back there?

might have to end up paying for it.

the whole thing? The appointment?

thinking when I submitted the book.

book published until...

whose daughter I was

until after was accepted.
I wouldn't have minded.

wanted it to be about your book

09:07.632 --> 09:09.776

meant something.

It does. Dad.
You know it does.

09:27.569 --> 09:30.213
And yet you turn around and
write an entirely new book

09:30.238 --> 09:32.157

that place at the table?

He asked me to.

I'm about to head over there.
You should come.

go over at your Dad's?

a book published.

10:41.392 --> 10:43.453
What?

10:43.478 --> 10:45.371
That was my reaction, too.

10:45.396 --> 10:47.791
That's great.

10:47.816 --> 10:50.835
I always thought your dad making you
and your sister keep journals was...

10:50.860 --> 10:53.797
a little strange, but...

10:53.822 --> 10:55.490
sounds like it's paying off.

10:55.615 --> 10:57.300
I can't believe it.

10:57.325 --> 10:58.635
Rusty, just let that go.

10:58.660 --> 11:00.512
No, why is it strange?

I just want to know why you
think it's so strange.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.974
Well, it just seems
like he was forcing you

11:04.999 --> 11:06.643
to be writers...

11:06.668 --> 11:08.686
instead of allowing
you to choose to be.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.563
We don't have to keep the
journals if we don't want to.

11:10.588 --> 11:12.482
You'd have to get a
job if you stopped.

11:12.507 --> 11:14.609
He pays us to do it so we
can focus on our writing

11:14.634 --> 11:16.820
instead of working some
bullshit job at McDonald's.

11:19.264 --> 11:21.366
What?

What?

Are you stoned?

11:24.269 --> 11:26.271
Are you kidding?
Are you being...

11:26.396 --> 11:29.249
I'm not stoned. Rusty, I'd like
to talk to you in the kitchen.

11:29.274 --> 11:31.000
I think you're stoned.

that Neanderthal...

11:41.536 --> 11:43.638
talk about Dad like that.

11:43.663 --> 11:45.431
He didn't say anything
about your father.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.725
It's not what he says.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.436
It's how he talks about him like he's
some sort of weirdo or something.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.313
And watching football doesn't
make you a Neanderthal.

11:52.338 --> 11:53.523

Is Sam's book really getting published?

It's been over a
year since we spoke.

12:13.610 --> 12:14.903

12:16.362 --> 12:19.048
She said to say hi to you.

for a second, but...

though, aren't you.

it easier to eat again.

ever, you understand me?

worry about me, Mom.

12:45.725 --> 12:47.243
(WHISPERS)
Yeah, I do.

12:47.268 --> 12:48.853
It's my job.

12:57.153 --> 12:59.280
I cleared the table and
started the dishes.

13:01.074 --> 13:02.592
Sorry I reacted the way I did.

13:02.617 --> 13:04.260
I was just surprised.

13:04.285 --> 13:05.805
I thought you were
happy with the book.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.555
I was.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.975
It just didn't seem
like my book anymore.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.253
It felt like someone else's.

13:14.379 --> 13:17.548
My editorial hand a little
heavy for you? Yes, Dad.

13:21.052 --> 13:24.155
I was scared of how you'd react,

13:24.180 --> 13:28.159
and I felt guilty because of all the
work you put into Just Saying Hi.

13:28.184 --> 13:30.812
- I'm sorry...
- Stop apologizing.

13:33.648 --> 13:37.610
It's my fault for involving myself in
your goddamn book in the first place.

13:39.612 --> 13:42.365
(SIGHS) I'm guessing you don't
want to read the new one?

13:44.200 --> 13:46.386
Fuck no.

13:46.411 --> 13:49.555
- Never?
- No, thank you.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.057
I brought you a hard copy.

13:51.082 --> 13:52.850
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.561
I was going to sign it
for you if you wanted,

13:55.586 --> 13:59.107
or not...
but maybe?

13:59.132 --> 14:00.550
Leave it on my desk.

14:04.804 --> 14:08.725
Wait... can I ask you a question
without you getting defensive?

14:12.270 --> 14:14.455
What?

14:14.480 --> 14:17.080
Rusty told me Martin called the
cops on a prowler the other night.

14:19.485 --> 14:22.196
Dad, you've got to stop doing this
to yourself. It's been two years.

14:22.321 --> 14:24.465
- She's coming back.
- You're completely delusional.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.367
And what's with setting a
place for her at the table?

14:26.492 --> 14:28.845
- That's fucking nuts.
- You know they're fighting again?

14:28.870 --> 14:30.054
And where did you see that?

14:30.079 --> 14:32.056
Through their window?

14:32.081 --> 14:34.392
Really? People get arrested
for doing things like that.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.102
You're a well respected novelist.

you've been writing.

her do to you, Dad.

15:11.204 --> 15:14.265
It's a poem for English class.

15:14.290 --> 15:17.310
Sorry about earlier.
I was being a dick.

15:17.335 --> 15:18.936
It's okay.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.563
Yeah, you were right.
I was just jealous.

15:20.588 --> 15:22.690
I really am happy for you.
It's awesome.

15:22.715 --> 15:25.193

published one day, too, you know.

Got your eye on any
girls this year?

15:41.275 --> 15:43.236
Yeah, there's this girl...

15:45.113 --> 15:47.924
Kate, in my English class.

15:47.949 --> 15:50.243
Every time I see her,
I hear that song,

15:50.368 --> 15:53.471
the Beatles' song, "ve Just Seen a
Face," playing in my head. (COUGHS)

15:53.496 --> 15:55.348
God, you are so pathetic.

15:55.373 --> 15:57.100
At least I know I'm pathetic.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.851
Let me give you some advice.

I can't wait to
hear your advice.

16:00.169 --> 16:02.605
It's so friggin' awesome.

16:02.630 --> 16:05.091
There are two kinds of
people in this world.

16:05.216 --> 16:09.362
Hopeless romantics and realists.
Right.

16:09.387 --> 16:11.864
A realist just sees that face

16:11.889 --> 16:15.118
and packs it in with every other
pretty girl they've ever seen before.

16:15.143 --> 16:18.496
The hopeless romantic
becomes convinced

16:18.521 --> 16:22.291
that God put them on Earth
to be with that one person.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.752
But there is no God,

16:24.777 --> 16:29.132
and life is only as meaningful as you
fool yourself into thinking it is.

16:29.157 --> 16:31.884
Guys who get laid a
lot are realists.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.703
You should be listening.

16:35.580 --> 16:38.182
Just avoid love at all costs.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.500
That's my motto.

16:43.546 --> 16:45.982
Never been in love?

16:46.007 --> 16:49.235
If love is setting a place at the table
for someone who is never coming home,

16:49.260 --> 16:50.761
I think I'll pass.

16:52.263 --> 16:54.490
That's fucking depressing, Sam.

16:54.515 --> 16:57.660
Making students read their poetry
assignments in front of the class

16:57.685 --> 16:59.871
is a sadistic exercise
in public humiliation.

16:59.896 --> 17:01.831
You could have already been
done with it by now, Rusty.

It's called School.

"And there's a loudness
to the whispers I hear."

"Whispers shouldn't be
that loud, should they?"

17:37.934 --> 17:40.036
"There's a girl over
there who everyone knows"

liked your poem.

18:04.252 --> 18:07.897
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it was really good.

18:07.922 --> 18:11.442
- Thanks.
- Sure.

18:11.467 --> 18:13.861
How was your Thanksgiving?

18:13.886 --> 18:16.572
Oh, it was good.
It was a little weird.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.374

20:31.399 --> 20:33.918

more than enough

and I can't share that with her.

27:53.173 --> 27:54.566
She won't return my calls.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.109
She won't return my emails.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.861
She's-she's having
a book published.

27:57.886 --> 27:59.680
She's busy.
Bullshit.

27:59.805 --> 28:01.573
I can't get her to return my calls.
Bullshit.

28:01.598 --> 28:04.076
She's petty and she's cruel.

28:04.101 --> 28:05.577
Everyone's parents are divorced.

28:05.602 --> 28:06.995
Big fucking deal.
You get over it.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.121
She fights with me, too.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.957
We're not fighting.

28:09.982 --> 28:12.042
That's the thing. I wish
I could fight with her.

28:12.067 --> 28:14.002
Then I'd be an active
participant in her life.

28:14.027 --> 28:16.171
She just abandoned me.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.507
No, I don't think... She's abandoned you?
That seems horrible.

28:18.532 --> 28:21.510
You are in a constant state
of denial about everything.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.971
Bill, she acts like I don't exist.

28:23.996 --> 28:26.014
I haven't spoken to her in over a year

28:26.039 --> 28:27.975
and you're not helping things.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.751
Me? I haven't said one thing.
I... I... What did I...

28:29.877 --> 28:32.855
You set a place for me
at Thanksgiving. Yeah.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.565
So everytime she comes
home from school,

28:34.590 --> 28:36.650
she sees you
miserable and moping

28:36.675 --> 28:38.652
and she blames me.
I know she blames me.

28:38.677 --> 28:39.837
I know she does.
I don't mope.

28:39.845 --> 28:41.530
Oh, you mope.

28:41.555 --> 28:42.948
You mope.

28:42.973 --> 28:44.700
Say horrible things about me,

28:44.725 --> 28:46.660
but don't try to win
her sympathy this way.

28:46.685 --> 28:49.246
Hey, I made a promise to you
and I intend to keep it.

28:49.271 --> 28:52.749
Oh, Jesus.
Bill...

28:52.774 --> 28:56.795
That was a lifetime ago.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.339
I release you from your promise.

28:59.364 --> 29:03.260
Please... go on
with your life.

29:03.285 --> 29:04.620
Go get laid.
I get laid.

29:04.745 --> 29:07.472
Great! You get laid? Mm-hmm.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.683
Well, then, be happy.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.893
I just want you to be happy.

29:10.918 --> 29:12.394
I was happy with you.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.104
You were the one
who wasn't happy.

29:14.129 --> 29:17.274
Well, I'm happy now.

29:17.299 --> 29:19.568
You don't look happy to me.

29:19.593 --> 29:23.680
When? When you're sneaking
around our house at night?

29:26.642 --> 29:29.703
I see you and Martin fighting.

29:29.728 --> 29:31.271
Shut up, Bill.

29:43.075 --> 29:44.593
Oh, hey.
Wait a minute.

29:44.618 --> 29:45.928
Excuse me.

29:45.953 --> 29:49.222
You know I...

29:49.247 --> 29:50.807
I don't mean to be presumptuous,

29:50.832 --> 29:53.852
but I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.188
I mean, he sleeps
with a lot of girls.

29:56.213 --> 29:58.774
You're practically guaranteed
to wake up with a rash.

29:58.799 --> 30:00.400
Thanks for the tip.

30:00.425 --> 30:02.069
I see you you getting
snared in his web.

30:02.094 --> 30:04.112
You look like a nice girl and all, so.

30:04.137 --> 30:05.781
I'm not a nice girl.

30:05.806 --> 30:07.908
Well, in that case, I'm Louis.

30:07.933 --> 30:10.702
Everyone calls me Lou.
Nice to meet you.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.412
No? Okay.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.498
Look, I don't want to
hurt your feelings,

30:14.523 --> 30:15.999
but you're wasting your time.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.834
What, talking is
a waste of time?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.544
We're not talking.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.171
You're flirting with me.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.382
And you're also
cockblocking your friend.

30:23.407 --> 30:25.676
Huh?
Bon Jovi over there?

30:25.701 --> 30:27.594
He's not my friend.
He's a dick, actually.

30:27.619 --> 30:29.846
I'm just filling in on
bass for them tonight.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.057
You're cute, Lou.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.768
But you reek of romance
and good intentions.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.395
I'm not looking for a nice guy.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.105
I don't do boyfriends,
and I don't date.

30:38.130 --> 30:41.024
All I heard was don't,
don't, don't, don't.

30:41.049 --> 30:43.110
Well, don't keep people safe.

30:43.135 --> 30:44.611
I'm going to go.

30:44.636 --> 30:47.364
Okay, well, I'll see you in class.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.074
Do we have a class together?

30:49.099 --> 30:51.435
Advanced Fiction Writing.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.121
I don't remember you.
Well, I remember you.

30:54.146 --> 30:57.624
You have a book that's getting published.
Your dad must be thrilled.

30:57.649 --> 30:59.543
You know an awful
lot about me, Lou.

30:59.568 --> 31:02.462
We writers are an
envious bunch, so...

31:02.487 --> 31:03.739
What's his name?

31:06.074 --> 31:08.802
His name is Pete.

31:08.827 --> 31:11.288
Have fun.
I will.

31:13.290 --> 31:15.208
Cool. You're awesome.

31:22.007 --> 31:24.276
I didn't know you lived at the beach.
Shh-shh.

31:24.301 --> 31:25.861
(WHISPERS)
Keep your voice down.

31:25.886 --> 31:27.738
I just don't want
to wake my dad up.

31:27.763 --> 31:30.807
I'm going to go get
some ice for that.

31:35.896 --> 31:37.856
- There you go.
- Thank you.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.878
Sure.

31:42.903 --> 31:44.379
Rusty?

31:44.404 --> 31:47.049
Hey, Dad, what are you doing up?

31:47.074 --> 31:48.842
Who's this?

31:48.867 --> 31:52.512
Uh, Dad, this is Kate.
Kate, this is Dad.

31:52.537 --> 31:54.289
Hi.

31:55.248 --> 31:57.100
Hi.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.543
What happened to your knees?

31:58.668 --> 32:01.271
- She fell.
- This asshole pushed me.

32:01.296 --> 32:03.690
Really?
Somebody pushed you?

32:03.715 --> 32:07.235
Yeah, but it's okay,
because Rusty punched him.

32:07.260 --> 32:10.405
Oh, good. Nobody should ever push
a girl and get away with it.

32:10.430 --> 32:11.865
That's a good start, that ice.

32:11.890 --> 32:14.618
We have some peroxide in here.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.578
So you are Kate.

32:16.603 --> 32:18.288
Rusty's told me a lot about you.

32:18.313 --> 32:21.458
He has? Um...

32:21.483 --> 32:23.335
We hardly know each other.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.087
I just know he thinks very highly of you.

32:25.112 --> 32:28.298
- Dad?
- Sorry, sorry.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.758
Are you staying the night?

32:29.783 --> 32:33.136
Uh, yeah, if that's okay.

32:33.161 --> 32:36.139
Okay. Your parents
don't mind?

32:36.164 --> 32:38.183
No.

32:38.208 --> 32:42.145
All right. You take the bed
and she takes the couch...

32:42.170 --> 32:45.774
Or the other way. You take the
couch and she takes the bed.

32:45.799 --> 32:48.110
Whichever one.

32:48.135 --> 32:49.402
Nice meeting you, Kate.

32:49.427 --> 32:54.032
You, too.
Goodnight.

32:54.057 --> 32:55.350
Sorry.

32:57.477 --> 32:58.787
Your dad's nice.

32:58.812 --> 33:00.522
Yeah, he's a good guy.

33:02.607 --> 33:03.834
What does he do?

33:03.859 --> 33:07.129
Uh... he's a writer.

33:07.154 --> 33:08.922
Like a real one?

33:08.947 --> 33:10.907
Yeah, he wrote a book
called Suit Monkeys.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.969
Won some awards, had a bunch
of books published. Thanks.

33:13.994 --> 33:17.139
Whoa, uh...

33:17.164 --> 33:19.724
I didn't know you were going
to... I'll turn around.

33:19.749 --> 33:22.561
Well, that's cool.

33:22.586 --> 33:24.604
Is that what you want to do?

33:24.629 --> 33:26.898
Uh, yeah.
I'm a writer, too.

33:26.923 --> 33:28.775
So is my sister.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.736
We write books and
stories and stuff.

33:31.761 --> 33:33.947
Poetry?

33:33.972 --> 33:35.824
Yeah.

33:35.849 --> 33:37.325
Where's your sister?

33:37.350 --> 33:40.061
She's, you know, away at college.

33:42.564 --> 33:44.166
Yeah, so I...

33:44.191 --> 33:48.628
Wait, can you stay with me a second?

33:48.653 --> 33:50.172
Please?

33:50.197 --> 33:52.365
Yeah, sure.

34:00.457 --> 34:02.918
You can come closer.
I don't bite.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.612
I have a question.

34:13.637 --> 34:15.263
Yeah...

34:18.808 --> 34:21.268
Was I the angel in
the poem you wrote?

34:23.772 --> 34:25.273
Yeah.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.922
I think you're going to
be very good for me.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.134
Goodnight.

35:02.519 --> 35:08.400
(PROFESSOR SPEAKING IN DISTANCE)

35:43.310 --> 35:45.395
I love Christmas.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.957
You strike me as one
of those people.

35:48.982 --> 35:52.627
I am. I'm definitely
one of those people.

35:52.652 --> 35:54.796
I love everything about it.

35:54.821 --> 35:58.091
I love the lights, the decorations,

35:58.116 --> 36:04.514
how TBS plays A Christmas
Story 24 hours straight.

36:04.539 --> 36:06.474
Presents under the tree

36:06.499 --> 36:09.311
and the looks on my kids'
faces when they open them.

36:09.336 --> 36:13.440
Sitting by the fire with my
husband when they go to bed.

36:13.465 --> 36:16.818
I get all depressed during the holidays.

36:16.843 --> 36:20.680
Yeah, well, you're divorced, Bill.
It's depressing.

36:22.557 --> 36:25.660
Hey, can I give you a little bit of advice?

36:25.685 --> 36:29.789
Just from one fuckbuddy to another.

36:29.814 --> 36:31.499
Mm-hmm.

36:31.524 --> 36:33.501
You need to remarry.

36:33.526 --> 36:35.003
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

36:35.028 --> 36:37.505
You're not getting any younger.

36:37.530 --> 36:41.760
And if I were you, I'd be
on every dating website

36:41.785 --> 36:45.472
signing up and just combing the
newspapers for personal ads.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.349
I haven't been on a date in 25 years.

36:47.374 --> 36:49.059
Yeah, but what is that?

36:49.084 --> 36:51.061
Listen, you're handsome, you're successful.

36:51.086 --> 36:52.937
You have a mild amount of celebrity,

36:52.962 --> 36:55.857
which is really all a writer can ask for.

36:55.882 --> 36:57.901
That's enough to land one of those

36:57.926 --> 37:00.528
20-something
trophy wives.

37:00.553 --> 37:03.031
You've really thought about this, huh?

37:03.056 --> 37:05.266
Well, I care about you, Bill.

37:06.518 --> 37:08.870
I know you love Erica,

37:08.895 --> 37:10.705
but she married someone else,

37:10.730 --> 37:12.957
and you have to start
thinking about your future

37:12.982 --> 37:16.795
and whether or not you want
that to be a happy one.

37:16.820 --> 37:19.172
Because I don't want to
jog by in five years

37:19.197 --> 37:21.716
and find you waiting on
that lawn chair for me.

37:21.741 --> 37:23.843
It's a very comfortable lawn chair.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.136
Is it?

37:25.161 --> 37:26.913
Just think about it.

37:38.842 --> 37:41.903
Procreation. You give to the
next one down the line.

37:41.928 --> 37:43.488
That's really all we've got.

37:43.513 --> 37:45.865
Society, government, money, religion,

37:45.890 --> 37:48.451
careers, nuclear families, monogamy.

37:48.476 --> 37:51.788
These are all just highly creative
socially accepted delusions

37:51.813 --> 37:56.292
that we impose on reality to try and gain
some semblance of control over our lives.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.294
It gives us the illusion of choice.

37:58.319 --> 38:02.006
It makes us feel a little
less like animals.

38:02.031 --> 38:04.467
Animals. What do you mean?
Like evolution?

38:04.492 --> 38:06.469
Yeah, evolution, exactly.

38:06.494 --> 38:08.304
I do not believe in evolution.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.141
There's 400 billion stars
in the Milky Way alone,

38:11.166 --> 38:13.143
making the amount of stars
in the entire universe

38:13.168 --> 38:15.562
completely mindboggling.

38:15.587 --> 38:17.439
We are nothing.

38:17.464 --> 38:19.566
If an asteroid hadn't hit
Earth 65 million years ago

38:19.591 --> 38:20.942
and wiped out all the dinosaurs,

38:20.967 --> 38:22.944
we wouldn't be here.

38:22.969 --> 38:25.613
Yeah.
I'm going to go.

38:25.638 --> 38:31.161
Good. All you creationists do is
blow chances at getting laid.

38:31.186 --> 38:34.873
- Really.
- Ooh, that was awkward.

38:34.898 --> 38:37.041
You've really got to stop stalking me.

38:37.066 --> 38:39.903
I can't even go anywhere without
you showing up to annoy me.

38:40.028 --> 38:42.589
- Were you hitting on that guy?
- It's none of your business.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.132
I think he's a Mormon.

38:44.157 --> 38:45.800
Well, what the hell
is he doing here?

38:45.825 --> 38:47.886
Trying to find other
Mormon girls.

38:47.911 --> 38:51.681
I'm sure you corrupted him,
ruined his relationship with God.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.183
You want to get out of here?

38:53.208 --> 38:55.435
Do you have brain damage?

38:55.460 --> 38:57.479
No. I think I made
it pretty clear

38:57.504 --> 38:59.647
that I have absolutely no
interest in going out with you.

38:59.672 --> 39:01.900
No, no, no. You and I
are going to be friends.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.735
But I don't want to be friends with you.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.237
(WHISPERS)
Oh, you don't want to be.

39:06.262 --> 39:08.364
Well, I'm going to
take your jacket

39:08.389 --> 39:10.575
and you can follow me. We can
get some coffee if you'd like.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.828
I need that...

39:13.853 --> 39:15.371
jacket.

39:15.396 --> 39:19.334
What are some of
your favorite books?

39:19.359 --> 39:21.920
Is that really the angle
you're going to play?

39:21.945 --> 39:25.573
Really? I thought you'd be
more creative than this.

39:25.698 --> 39:29.469
Well, come on, we're writers, right?
Yeah.

39:29.494 --> 39:32.263
Books matter to us. I mean,
come on here, please.

39:32.288 --> 39:35.767
Fine, what are some of
your favorite books?

39:35.792 --> 39:37.727
No, you can't do that.
I asked you.

39:37.752 --> 39:39.832
Because you want to know
something personal about me.

39:39.837 --> 39:42.106
If I tell you what my
favorite books are,

39:42.131 --> 39:44.400
you'll say titles that will
convince me that we're soulmates,

39:44.425 --> 39:46.402
or you'll latch onto
one of my favorites

39:46.427 --> 39:48.321
and try to convince me it's
one of your favorites, too.

39:48.346 --> 39:49.781
God, you're so tough.

39:49.806 --> 39:51.157
It's why you're
obsessed with me.

39:51.182 --> 39:52.492
I'm not obsessed with you.

39:52.517 --> 39:54.118
I'm like a unicorn to you.

39:54.143 --> 39:55.954
You'll do or say
anything to possess me.

39:55.979 --> 39:58.248
I'm not like that and
you're not like a unicorn.

39:58.273 --> 40:00.208
Okay, well, then books.

40:00.233 --> 40:02.418
But please, at least
attempt to be interesting.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.921
No Catcher in the Rye or
Portnoy's Complaint, okay?

40:04.946 --> 40:09.259
Well, I write mysteries, so...

40:09.284 --> 40:12.262
I love Elmore Leonard,
James Lee Burke,

40:12.287 --> 40:13.930
Ed Brubaker.

40:13.955 --> 40:16.391
Who's Ed Brubaker.

40:16.416 --> 40:20.270
He writes an incredible, hard-boiled
crime comic called Criminal.

40:20.295 --> 40:22.564
Telling me that you
read comic books

40:22.589 --> 40:25.233
isn't exactly sweeping
me off my feet.

40:25.258 --> 40:27.277
What's your favorite book?

40:27.302 --> 40:29.302
Just say the first thing
that pops into your head.

40:30.388 --> 40:32.432
Dear Mr. Henshaw
by Beverly Cleary.

40:34.142 --> 40:36.369
Been my favorite
since I was a kid.

40:36.394 --> 40:38.204
Read it, like, 100 times.

40:38.229 --> 40:41.107
It's actually what made
me want to be a writer.

40:42.442 --> 40:43.442
Hey, is something wrong?

40:43.443 --> 40:45.420
I have to go.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.255
Well, what... what do you mean?
Did I do something?

40:47.280 --> 40:48.756
I have to go.

40:48.781 --> 40:49.824
Samantha.

40:52.243 --> 40:54.470
- Samantha, wait. Come on.
- What?

40:54.495 --> 40:56.180
What do you want from me?

40:56.205 --> 40:57.724
What do you mean what
do I want from you?

40:57.749 --> 40:59.208
I like you.

40:59.334 --> 41:00.960
- I want to get to know you better.
- No.

41:01.085 --> 41:02.979
- Why do you keep running away?
- Because this...

41:03.004 --> 41:05.023
whatever this is between us,
it can't go any further.

41:05.048 --> 41:07.817
I won't let it. We're not
even in the same species.

41:07.842 --> 41:10.612
Is Dear Mr. Henshaw
your favorite book, too?

41:10.637 --> 41:12.280
I don't do this, Lou.

41:12.305 --> 41:13.781
No.
No, of course not.

41:13.806 --> 41:15.617
You just give yourself away

41:15.642 --> 41:17.810
to assholes with infinitely
lower IQs than yours.

41:23.983 --> 41:25.460
Fuck.

41:25.485 --> 41:28.755
(KNOCKING)

41:28.780 --> 41:31.115
Hi.
Hi.

41:32.575 --> 41:34.510
Is your dad here?

41:34.535 --> 41:36.012
Uh, no...

41:36.037 --> 41:38.640
Well, when is he going to be back?

41:38.665 --> 41:42.185
I don't know. Maybe
a couple of hours.

41:42.210 --> 41:43.853
Why?

41:43.878 --> 41:47.674
I want to give you your Christmas present.

41:51.094 --> 41:52.929
Um, okay.

42:03.606 --> 42:04.707
Merry Christmas.

42:04.732 --> 42:07.168
Oh...
awesome.

42:07.193 --> 42:09.420
Come with me.

42:09.445 --> 42:10.838
Where are we going?

42:10.863 --> 42:12.507
To the closet.

42:12.532 --> 42:15.093
Wait, why the closet?
Why not on the bed?

42:15.118 --> 42:17.387
Can we open it?
(LAUGHS)

42:17.412 --> 42:22.600
Because you've never had sex,

42:22.625 --> 42:27.563
and I've never had sex in a closet.

42:27.588 --> 42:32.110
You'll remember me and
you'll remember this moment

42:32.135 --> 42:35.054
and that makes me very, very happy.

42:45.148 --> 42:47.900
(RUSTY AND KATE LAUGHING)

43:23.436 --> 43:24.436
Oh, fuck.

43:31.736 --> 43:33.279
Hi.

43:36.115 --> 43:37.675
How's she feeling?

43:37.700 --> 43:40.203
She's okay. You
should go see her.

43:59.055 --> 44:00.348
How you feeling?

44:02.767 --> 44:04.535
Not too bad.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.120
Don't bullshit me.

44:06.145 --> 44:08.206
I'm like a no bullshit detector here.

44:08.231 --> 44:11.083
I'm fine.

44:11.108 --> 44:13.736
- Shut up and read to me.
- Okay.

44:24.622 --> 44:28.893
"Dalie Hallie couldn't tell
if she felt huge or small."

44:28.918 --> 44:31.395
"She wondered whether her head"

44:31.420 --> 44:34.941
"were so big as to be able to
contain all this starry universe..."

44:34.966 --> 44:37.610
"or if the universe were so
little that it would fit"

44:37.635 --> 44:40.238
"within the compass
of her human head."

44:40.263 --> 44:42.949
Lou?

44:42.974 --> 44:45.660
Do you see that
angel by the door

44:45.685 --> 44:47.854
or am I the only one seeing her?

44:54.068 --> 44:58.072
Oh, that... that's definitely
not an angel, Mom.

45:04.245 --> 45:06.706
Hi.
Hi.

45:06.831 --> 45:09.267
Hi. What are you doing here?

45:09.292 --> 45:11.978
Oh, same thing you're
doing, I hope.

45:12.003 --> 45:13.563
Don't be suspicious.

45:13.588 --> 45:16.399
I'm getting a laptop
for Samantha.

45:16.424 --> 45:19.360
In fact, I got to pick out a color.
Why don't you come?

45:19.385 --> 45:21.195
I don't know.
Excuse me.

45:21.220 --> 45:23.614
Huh?
What don't you know?

45:23.639 --> 45:26.659
I don't know if it's a good idea, Bill.

45:26.684 --> 45:29.537
It will take ten minutes.

45:29.562 --> 45:30.872
I'd love to.
Yeah.

45:30.897 --> 45:33.291
Yeah?
Yeah, I'd love to.

45:33.316 --> 45:35.918
I'm glad I bumped into you.

45:35.943 --> 45:38.421
I'm sure that's what all stalkers say.

45:38.446 --> 45:41.883
No, really.

45:41.908 --> 45:44.118
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

45:44.243 --> 45:46.304
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

45:46.329 --> 45:48.598
Somebody else said the
same thing recently.

45:48.623 --> 45:51.667
Someone else asked you to stop
hanging around their house at night?

45:53.377 --> 45:55.338
About moving on with my life.

45:57.381 --> 45:59.358
Who was that?

45:59.383 --> 46:01.152
Tricia Wolcott.

46:01.177 --> 46:02.987
Lives about a mile and
a half down the beach.

46:03.012 --> 46:04.864
Yeah, I remember her.
Yeah.

46:04.889 --> 46:07.909
Yeah.
Yeah.

46:07.934 --> 46:10.828
I always suspected you
had a crush on her.

46:10.853 --> 46:12.705
Yeah, she's very pretty.

46:12.730 --> 46:15.441
She's very married, as I recall.

46:17.693 --> 46:19.462
You're seeing her?

46:19.487 --> 46:21.297
I think I'm a good way
for her to kill an hour

46:21.322 --> 46:23.115
after she drops her
kids off at school.

46:24.533 --> 46:25.718
An hour?

46:25.743 --> 46:27.720
An hour.

46:27.745 --> 46:31.933
So she thinks you need to
stop moping around, too, huh?

46:31.958 --> 46:34.560
Something like that.

46:34.585 --> 46:36.253
Here's a confession.

46:38.005 --> 46:39.840
I'm not a great writer.

46:41.592 --> 46:44.153
I'm a great
re-writer.

46:44.178 --> 46:46.222
I think about us.

46:47.306 --> 46:48.991
Our story and...

46:49.016 --> 46:51.160
and all the things that
went wrong with us

46:51.185 --> 46:54.146
and I... I could do it so
much better this time.

46:58.401 --> 47:00.670
I haven't written
anything since you left.

47:00.695 --> 47:02.672
Bill...

47:02.697 --> 47:04.757
you've had two books published.

47:04.782 --> 47:07.760
Well, they were books that I
started when we were married.

47:07.785 --> 47:09.720
I finished them, but I haven't
written anything new.

47:09.745 --> 47:11.973
You are a great writer.

47:11.998 --> 47:15.167
Don't waste all your
imagination on me.

47:21.382 --> 47:22.483
Which way are you...

47:22.508 --> 47:24.485
I'm over here.

47:24.510 --> 47:26.570
I'm the other way.

47:26.595 --> 47:29.407
It was great running into you.

47:29.432 --> 47:32.076
You, too.

47:32.101 --> 47:33.811
Bill...

47:37.523 --> 47:42.962
I have... I have days when I'm not
sure if I made the right decision.

47:42.987 --> 47:45.197
I have bad days, too.

47:48.534 --> 47:50.928
I don't know why I'm saying this.

47:50.953 --> 47:54.015
I guess I just don't want you to
think that I don't think about us,

47:54.040 --> 47:56.684
you know, and...

47:56.709 --> 47:58.144
all those years we
spent together,

47:58.169 --> 47:59.228
because I do...

47:59.253 --> 48:01.605
think about...

48:01.630 --> 48:03.591
everything that I gave up.

48:06.302 --> 48:08.345
I wonder if it was worth it.

48:10.181 --> 48:11.724
Was it?

48:17.938 --> 48:20.291
I got to go.
(SIGHS)

48:20.316 --> 48:21.776
Merry Christmas.

48:24.737 --> 48:26.447
Merry Christmas.

48:29.283 --> 48:31.635
It was so nice to meet you.

48:31.660 --> 48:34.055
Oh, you, too, Samantha.

48:34.080 --> 48:36.557
I hope you come back
and see me again soon.

48:36.582 --> 48:38.225
- I will.
- Okay, you two.

48:38.250 --> 48:39.643
I'm going to walk
Sam to her car.

48:39.668 --> 48:41.729
I'll be right back, Mom.

48:41.754 --> 48:43.898
CARETAKER: Not so fast.
I made hot chocolate.

48:43.923 --> 48:45.049
It's in the kitchen.

48:46.801 --> 48:49.512
What's wrong with your mom?

48:51.722 --> 48:55.785
She, um...
She has a brain tumor.

48:55.810 --> 48:58.604
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

49:02.608 --> 49:05.002
I can't believe how much of
a bitch I've been to you.

49:05.027 --> 49:07.004
Yeah, I know, right?

49:07.029 --> 49:09.715
Okay, yeah.

49:09.740 --> 49:14.637
I don't... I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

49:14.662 --> 49:18.140
Really, I...

49:18.165 --> 49:21.435
I've enjoyed all of our back
and forth, you know, sparring.

49:21.460 --> 49:24.355
It's really... it's helped me
take my mind off of all this.

49:24.380 --> 49:28.134
Well, I'm glad I could help out.

49:29.802 --> 49:31.570
You going home for Christmas?

49:31.595 --> 49:33.973
Yeah, I'm headed back there tomorrow.

49:36.142 --> 49:41.580
Well, I'm willing to forget about
this whole stalking incident,

49:41.605 --> 49:44.125
if you will allow me to take you out

49:44.150 --> 49:46.085
on a proper date when you get back.

49:46.110 --> 49:47.319
Okay.

49:49.071 --> 49:50.464
Really?
That easy? Yeah?

49:50.489 --> 49:52.842
I'm not going to say it again.

49:52.867 --> 49:54.510
Okay.

49:54.535 --> 49:57.596
Oh, I actually...

49:57.621 --> 50:02.585
brought you an ARC of my new book.

50:02.710 --> 50:06.355
Oh, wow. Stalking and a present.

50:06.380 --> 50:11.694
Under the Pink by Samantha Borgens.
Look at that.

50:11.719 --> 50:18.409
Well, I will... I will
read this over break.

50:18.434 --> 50:20.452
Probably aloud.

50:20.477 --> 50:23.080
My mom and I have been tearing
through some books lately.

50:23.105 --> 50:25.291
No, you can't read it to her.

50:25.316 --> 50:27.710
It's filled with sex and profanity.

50:27.735 --> 50:29.862
Oh, no, she loves sex.

50:32.489 --> 50:34.675
SAMANTHA:
You added too much water.

50:34.700 --> 50:37.303
BILL: It's not like you're
Martha Stewart in here.

50:37.328 --> 50:41.665
Says the guy who puts sprinkles on burn.

50:41.790 --> 50:43.559
Hey, guys.

50:43.584 --> 50:44.894
Look at you!

50:44.919 --> 50:46.312
Why are you all dressed up?

50:46.337 --> 50:47.897
I'm going over to Kate's.

50:47.922 --> 50:49.565
Why does it smell so horrible in here?

50:49.590 --> 50:51.609
No, no, no. These are our cookies.
Smell.

50:51.634 --> 50:53.485
Yeah, we burned the first batch.

50:53.510 --> 50:55.362
Actually, this is the second.
(FIRE ALARM BEEPS)

50:55.387 --> 50:57.531
No, no, no, no, no!

50:57.556 --> 51:00.434
Sorry!

51:00.559 --> 51:02.578
Oh, my God, Dad!
What?

51:02.603 --> 51:04.121
This is ridiculous!

51:04.146 --> 51:05.748
We burned them again!

51:05.773 --> 51:06.999
Oh, God. Okay...
(LAUGHING)

51:07.024 --> 51:09.293
Yeah, no laughing, Rusty.

51:09.318 --> 51:11.420
When am I going to meet this girl?

51:11.445 --> 51:13.380
I don't know. Try not
to burn the house down.

51:13.405 --> 51:14.423
Yeah, drive careful.

51:14.448 --> 51:15.616
I will.

51:17.493 --> 51:19.553
How serious is this thing?

51:19.578 --> 51:21.722
Uh, they're having sex.

51:21.747 --> 51:24.833
What?
How do you know?

51:24.959 --> 51:28.479
Yeah.
Wow, go Rusty!

51:28.504 --> 51:30.189
She has more experience than him.

51:30.214 --> 51:32.191
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

51:32.216 --> 51:34.426
He seems really happy.

51:35.928 --> 51:37.655
At least someone in this house is.

51:37.680 --> 51:40.532
Do you see a frown on my face?

51:40.557 --> 51:43.577
You do seem unusually chipper today.

51:43.602 --> 51:45.412
Have you discovered
anti-depressants?

51:45.437 --> 51:49.708
Actually, no. I'm just
moving on with my life.

51:49.733 --> 51:51.418
I'm done with the whole
thing with your mom,

51:51.443 --> 51:53.379
and I'm moving forward.

51:53.404 --> 51:56.090
Seriously?

51:56.115 --> 51:58.008
New Year's resolution.

51:58.033 --> 51:59.927
How about that?
Moving on.

51:59.952 --> 52:01.595
Dad?
Yeah.

52:01.620 --> 52:02.930
That's huge!

52:02.955 --> 52:05.099
That's so...
Oh, flour hug.

52:05.124 --> 52:08.394
No, no, no!

52:08.419 --> 52:09.728
Not on my white shirt.

52:09.753 --> 52:11.605
Ta-da!

52:11.630 --> 52:13.630
I thought you already gave
me my Christmas present.

52:13.632 --> 52:15.776
Shut up and open it.
Come on.

52:15.801 --> 52:18.012
All right, here we go.

52:20.139 --> 52:21.615
This isn't just a CD.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.117
It isn't?
No.

52:23.142 --> 52:26.020
It's a roadmap to my soul.

52:27.688 --> 52:29.415
It's like if you gave me a favorite book.

52:29.440 --> 52:32.376
Yeah, speaking of that.

52:32.401 --> 52:33.711
Boom.

52:33.736 --> 52:35.404
Oh, my gosh.

52:39.241 --> 52:42.886
Wow, this is the biggest
book I've ever seen.

52:42.911 --> 52:44.430
I know it looks formidable,

52:44.455 --> 52:46.515
but honestly, it's going to be, like,

52:46.540 --> 52:49.101
one of the most satisfying reading
experiences of your life.

52:49.126 --> 52:50.853
Is it scary?

52:50.878 --> 52:52.813
Yeah, sure, but it's not just a scary book.

52:52.838 --> 52:54.565
It's like Moby Dick.
It's about everything.

52:54.590 --> 52:56.567
You're going to be so wrapped up in it,

52:56.592 --> 52:58.819
you're going to be crying at
the end of it. You cried.

52:58.844 --> 53:00.404
Oh, you'll cry, too, okay?

53:00.429 --> 53:01.847
I might have cried.

53:04.600 --> 53:07.895
You're really cute when you
get worked up about books.

53:12.441 --> 53:15.794
Do I have you worked up about me?

53:15.819 --> 53:18.130
Yeah.
Good.

53:18.155 --> 53:21.342
Because I've got to have you right now.

53:21.367 --> 53:23.218
What about your parents?
Won't they come in?

53:23.243 --> 53:25.621
They don't come in here.

53:25.746 --> 53:28.040
Are you sure? I'm sure.
Come here.

53:32.378 --> 53:33.854
LOU:
How was your Christmas?

53:33.879 --> 53:35.522
It was good.

53:35.547 --> 53:38.133
Filled with family. You know, loud.
Yeah.

53:41.053 --> 53:44.239
So you haven't mentioned my book.

53:44.264 --> 53:47.326
Mm. Yeah, um...

53:47.351 --> 53:48.577
So you didn't like it?

53:48.602 --> 53:50.079
No, no, that's not it.

53:50.104 --> 53:51.413
I liked it a lot.

53:51.438 --> 53:53.791
It's incredibly well written.

53:53.816 --> 53:57.711
The characters are vibrant and alive.

53:57.736 --> 53:59.213
But?

53:59.238 --> 54:01.256
I mean, I knew you were cynical,

54:01.281 --> 54:06.428
but is that really how you
feel about love and marriage?

54:06.453 --> 54:09.973
I don't know.
Sometimes.

54:09.998 --> 54:12.209
Oh, thank you.

54:16.463 --> 54:18.148
How much of that really happened?

54:18.173 --> 54:21.026
I made most of it up.

54:21.051 --> 54:23.070
I didn't draw that much
from my parents' divorce,

54:23.095 --> 54:24.947
other than the little
girl seeing her mother

54:24.972 --> 54:27.141
having sex with the man on the beach.

54:27.266 --> 54:30.577
Holy shit, that really happened?
Yeah.

54:30.602 --> 54:34.039
I mean, I wasn't a little girl.
I was in high school.

54:34.064 --> 54:37.751
My parents were having a party,
and I was up on the roof.

54:37.776 --> 54:39.795
It was late, and my mom

54:39.820 --> 54:43.048
came staggering out of the
back of the house with Martin.

54:43.073 --> 54:45.801
And she was all over him.

54:45.826 --> 54:47.344
And I remember Martin saying,

54:47.369 --> 54:50.097
"What about Bill?
What if Bill sees?"

54:50.122 --> 54:52.766
And my mom replying,

54:52.791 --> 54:55.602
"I don't care."

54:55.627 --> 54:57.963
"I don't care."

55:02.342 --> 55:05.387
- Hey, Lou?
- Mm-hmm.

55:07.514 --> 55:09.850
You make me feel less cynical.

55:12.186 --> 55:14.621
SAMANTHA: My turn?
My turn. Uh...

55:14.646 --> 55:17.207
Favorite TV show.

55:17.232 --> 55:19.209
- The Wonder Years.
- Oh, all right, that's nice.

55:19.234 --> 55:23.130
I'm still in love
with Winnie Cooper.

55:23.155 --> 55:26.049
Okay, favorite song.

55:26.074 --> 55:28.635
Beatles.
"Polythene Pam."

55:28.660 --> 55:32.055
- Great choice.
- Thank you. Yours?

55:32.080 --> 55:34.833
"Between the Bars" by Elliot Smith.

55:37.127 --> 55:39.396
Play it for me.

55:39.421 --> 55:42.733
I actually do have it here.

55:42.758 --> 55:44.485
You're in luck.

55:44.510 --> 55:48.155
Although this is...
This is really no way to...

55:48.180 --> 55:51.992
- to hear a song.
- Just play it.

55:52.017 --> 55:53.869
Will you at least close your eyes,

55:53.894 --> 55:55.704
because you got to block
out all this other stuff.

55:55.729 --> 55:58.565
- It's really distracting.
- Okay. You're funny.

And that's the picture that
you want to have up there?

57:51.928 --> 57:53.947
I'm going to trump that though, real quick,

57:53.972 --> 57:57.826
because you look like a serial killer.

57:57.851 --> 57:59.536
Let's take another one.

57:59.561 --> 58:01.455
Let me show you a test picture.

58:01.480 --> 58:03.081
Let me show you how it's done, okay?

58:03.106 --> 58:04.875
If I were on this website, I'd say,

58:04.900 --> 58:07.653
"Oh, I'd love to go on
a date with you. Yeah?"

58:10.113 --> 58:12.032
Did you actually pay for that?

58:13.116 --> 58:14.368
No?
No.

58:17.788 --> 58:19.473
Can I ask you a serious question?

58:19.498 --> 58:20.666
Are you color blind?

58:26.338 --> 58:28.190
Fuck, no.

58:28.215 --> 58:30.609
Professional.
You do not... no.

58:30.634 --> 58:32.277
You know what?

58:32.302 --> 58:33.862
You do not look ready to party.
I think...

58:33.887 --> 58:35.739
Let me just take a look.

58:35.764 --> 58:38.909
Are you being serious with this?

58:38.934 --> 58:40.410
We're not in Cancun.

58:40.435 --> 58:41.728
Eh, no.

58:44.523 --> 58:46.041
That's my favorite shirt.

58:46.066 --> 58:47.359
Don't ever do it.

58:48.819 --> 58:50.003
(LAUGHING)

58:50.028 --> 58:53.256
Okay, good.
Right?

58:53.281 --> 58:55.384
Come get in this right now.

58:55.409 --> 58:57.494
Let's do it.
Oh...

59:02.416 --> 59:04.017
Hubba, hubba.

59:04.042 --> 59:06.144
Have you had this the whole time?
Yeah.

59:06.169 --> 59:09.439
Why on Earth... you are
endlessly frustrating.

59:09.464 --> 59:12.776
Oh, I would definitely
fuck you in this outfit.

59:12.801 --> 59:15.153
How do you feel?
Good.

59:15.178 --> 59:18.615
Oh, right?

59:18.640 --> 59:19.891
Okay, come on.

59:51.965 --> 59:55.677
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOG)

01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:21.756
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey!

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:23.884
- You made it. Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:25.302
- I'm Kate.
- I'm Erica.

01:02:25.327 --> 01:02:26.578
TOGETHER:
Nice to meet you.

01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:17.437
Hey, can I help you find something?

01:03:17.462 --> 01:03:21.191
I was looking for some aspirin.
I have a headache.

01:03:21.216 --> 01:03:22.801
Oh, should be in there.

01:03:26.596 --> 01:03:27.973
I got it.
Thank you.

01:03:46.116 --> 01:03:48.301
- William.
- Hey.

01:03:48.326 --> 01:03:49.886
It's so good to see you again.
How are you?

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:51.846
Great to see you, too, Leslie.

01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:53.890
- This is my son, Rusty...
- Hi.

01:03:53.915 --> 01:03:55.225
- And his girlfriend, Kate.
- Hello.

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.310
Nice to meet you.

01:03:57.335 --> 01:03:59.270
This was so nice of you to do
this for Samantha, really.

01:03:59.295 --> 01:04:00.939
This is great.

01:04:00.964 --> 01:04:03.133
I'd have done the
same thing for you

01:04:03.258 --> 01:04:05.735
if you'd published Suit Monkeys
under my watch. Yeah, well...

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.989
I would like you to meet your
daughter, Samantha Borgens.

01:04:09.014 --> 01:04:11.491
You might think you've
met Samantha before,

01:04:11.516 --> 01:04:15.370
but this Samantha just received a
starred review from Publisher's Weekly.

01:04:15.395 --> 01:04:17.872
MAN:
And life will never be the same again.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:20.917
- Hi, Dad.
- Congratulations.

01:04:20.942 --> 01:04:23.069
Thank you so much.

01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:25.505
- And this is my boyfriend, Lou.
- Hi.

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:27.507
Nice to meet you. Very nice
to finally meet you, yeah.

01:04:27.532 --> 01:04:29.384
Mr. Murphy is a talented
writer as well.

01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:31.302
He's my Patricia Highsmith.
I don't know.

01:04:31.327 --> 01:04:33.596
Samantha, can I steal your
father for a little bit?

01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:35.682
There's so many young
writers around here

01:04:35.707 --> 01:04:37.517
who are just dying to meet him.

01:04:37.542 --> 01:04:38.852
He's all yours.

01:04:38.877 --> 01:04:40.854
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:04:40.879 --> 01:04:44.858
Hey, Sis. Congratulations.
Thank you so much for coming.

01:04:44.883 --> 01:04:47.318
It's so nice to finally meet you.

01:04:47.343 --> 01:04:49.237
Sam tells me you're a
huge Stephen King fan.

01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:51.948
I'm like the biggest Stephen
King fan in the world.

01:04:51.973 --> 01:04:53.742
I love The Sand.
It's my favorite one.

01:04:53.767 --> 01:04:55.452
What?
Since when?

01:04:55.477 --> 01:04:57.078
What do you mean?

01:04:57.103 --> 01:04:58.496
Who doesn't like Stephen King?

01:04:58.521 --> 01:04:59.956
She doesn't like Stephen King.

01:04:59.981 --> 01:05:01.666
I don't not...
let's leave them.

01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:03.334
Let's get... She calls
herself a novelist.

01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:04.999
You guys continue this.
We're going to go.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:09.007
Girls.
Yeah.

01:05:09.032 --> 01:05:11.718
Two champagnes, please.

01:05:11.743 --> 01:05:13.386
How old is she?

01:05:13.411 --> 01:05:15.221
21.

01:05:15.246 --> 01:05:17.182
I wouldn't believe you if
you told me she was 18

01:05:17.207 --> 01:05:18.641
much less 21.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:19.726
How old are you?

01:05:19.751 --> 01:05:21.853
This is my party.

01:05:21.878 --> 01:05:24.105
Stop acting like a pussy.
Nobody's going to tell on you.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.900
And I haven't even told you about
the big tip I'm going to leave you.

01:05:26.925 --> 01:05:29.819
As far as I know, you ordered
these drinks for yourself.

01:05:29.844 --> 01:05:32.155
I didn't even see her here.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.742
And here's the drinks
you ordered, Miss. Enjoy.

01:05:35.767 --> 01:05:37.393
I will...

01:05:43.566 --> 01:05:46.377
Thank you.

01:05:46.402 --> 01:05:48.630
Samantha!

01:05:48.655 --> 01:05:50.548
Oh, sorry...

01:05:50.573 --> 01:05:52.826
Don't worry about it. It's your night.
Go have fun.

01:05:55.662 --> 01:05:58.848
Ladies and gentlemen, could I
have your kind attention, please.

01:05:58.873 --> 01:06:01.434
You may come forward if you wish.

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:05.980
I have been trying to get William Borgens
up here to speak to my class for years.

01:06:06.005 --> 01:06:09.651
He's never said no, but he's
never said yes, either.

01:06:09.676 --> 01:06:13.696
Tonight, I have him at a
certain disadvantage.

01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:16.241
My entire class is here, Bill.

01:06:16.266 --> 01:06:18.785
And I insist you come up
here and say a few words.

01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:22.772
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Borgens.

01:06:28.236 --> 01:06:32.048
Your Professor, while a very nice
man, is a sneaky son of a bitch.

01:06:32.073 --> 01:06:34.634
(CROWD LAUGHS)

01:06:34.659 --> 01:06:38.429
The reason Leslie could never get me up
here to talk about the process of writing

01:06:38.454 --> 01:06:42.517
is I'm not sure I have much to say
about it that could benefit you.

01:06:42.542 --> 01:06:45.854
I still find it all very mysterious,

01:06:45.879 --> 01:06:48.148
years after I wrote my first book.

01:06:48.173 --> 01:06:50.817
And I'm not sure what it
is that compels a person

01:06:50.842 --> 01:06:54.320
to continue to play make believe

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:57.782
even after they're an adult.

01:06:57.807 --> 01:07:01.828
My favorite book is a collection
of short stories by Raymond Carver

01:07:01.853 --> 01:07:05.165
called What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love.

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:10.753
And in the closing lines of the
title story, Carver says...

01:07:10.778 --> 01:07:14.215
"I could hear my heart beating."

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.927
"I could hear everyone's heart."

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:21.706
"I could hear the human
noise we sat there making."

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.769
"Not one of us moved."

01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:29.939
"Not even when
the room went dark."

01:07:29.964 --> 01:07:32.859
And I think that that's what writing is.

01:07:32.884 --> 01:07:35.570
It's listening for that beating heart,

01:07:35.595 --> 01:07:38.323
and when we hear it,

01:07:38.348 --> 01:07:44.204
it's our job to decipher it
to the best of our abilities.

01:07:44.229 --> 01:07:46.481
(APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

01:07:50.652 --> 01:07:54.505
I'm here because my daughter
Samantha's book is being published

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:56.549
in case you haven't heard.

01:07:56.574 --> 01:07:58.409
This is her success.

01:07:59.494 --> 01:08:01.429
I love you, Dad.

01:08:01.454 --> 01:08:03.581
I love you, too.

01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:11.881
This seat taken?

01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:17.946
Louis invited me.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:21.115
Well, that was a
calculated risk.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.908
How long you been here?

01:08:22.934 --> 01:08:27.121
Mm, I was waiting in my
car for about an hour

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.774
trying to build up the
courage to come in.

01:08:31.776 --> 01:08:33.795
So that's what 19 looks like.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:38.508
She's all grown up now.
No.

01:08:38.533 --> 01:08:40.718
She's still just a baby.

01:08:40.743 --> 01:08:42.095
You going to talk to her?

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.805
I don't know.

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:45.974
I'm scared.

01:08:45.999 --> 01:08:50.310
Yeah, she's scary.

01:08:50.336 --> 01:08:51.895
She's all I've done with my life,

01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:54.299
and she doesn't want me.

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:00.470
Hey...

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.475
you want some courage?

01:09:07.562 --> 01:09:09.314
Free of charge.

01:09:10.857 --> 01:09:14.127
Yes, please.

01:09:14.152 --> 01:09:16.170
Your favorite book...

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.881
John Cheever's The World of Apples.

01:09:19.907 --> 01:09:22.660
I got you that signed first edition.
Yeah.

01:09:30.084 --> 01:09:32.377
That's your favorite book, right?

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:38.151
Um, well, I really liked it.
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:38.176 --> 01:09:41.069
I even told you what to read.

01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:42.930
Sometimes.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.685
I'm sorry.

01:09:53.483 --> 01:09:57.712
Anyway, she swiped
it from my library.

01:09:57.737 --> 01:09:59.172
She did?

01:09:59.197 --> 01:10:01.341
Yeah.

01:10:01.366 --> 01:10:04.969
It could only have been her.

01:10:04.994 --> 01:10:06.763
She thought that it was
your favorite book.

01:10:06.788 --> 01:10:10.099
That's what I had
told her, and...

01:10:10.124 --> 01:10:14.003
I think she was hoping to
find some piece of you in it.

01:10:20.093 --> 01:10:22.345

Go talk to your daughter.

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:46.119

- Come on, Sam, don't do this.
- It's okay, Louis.

01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.253

tell you that...

her, we were at the bar.

I got her a champagne,
but that was ages ago.

You got her champagne?

01:12:24.926 --> 01:12:27.320
She's underage.
It's no big deal.

01:12:27.345 --> 01:12:29.238
No, it is a big deal, okay,

01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:31.157
because she has a history
and she has a drug problem,

01:12:31.182 --> 01:12:32.366
so she can't drink.

01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:33.576

Have you seen her?

left with some guy.

01:20:20.734 --> 01:20:23.337
I'm letting the ocean
get me, Daddy!

01:20:23.362 --> 01:20:26.073
I'm letting the ocean get me!

01:20:28.492 --> 01:20:31.136
Your mom used to watch
you like a hawk.

01:20:31.161 --> 01:20:34.098
She was terrified that the
ocean was going to grab you

01:20:34.123 --> 01:20:36.100
and pull you out to sea.

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:37.768
Why are we talking about her?

01:20:37.793 --> 01:20:39.603
What are we doing down here?

01:20:39.628 --> 01:20:42.064
Your mom loves you.

01:20:42.089 --> 01:20:43.899
She never did anything to you.

01:20:43.924 --> 01:20:46.093
It's pointless. I know
what you're going to say.

01:20:47.845 --> 01:20:49.571
No, you don't.

01:20:49.596 --> 01:20:52.157
Those things she did to me,

01:20:52.182 --> 01:20:54.743
the things you've been
holding over her,

01:20:54.768 --> 01:20:57.746
I had already done
to her years ago.

01:20:57.771 --> 01:20:59.523
What are you talking about?

01:21:03.152 --> 01:21:04.712
I fell in love with somebody,

01:21:04.737 --> 01:21:06.155
and and got lost, left.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.073
Bullshit. You were just a baby,

01:21:08.198 --> 01:21:10.217
- and your mother waited for me.
- Shut up, Dad.

01:21:10.242 --> 01:21:12.411
She waited six months, Samantha.

01:21:12.536 --> 01:21:15.222
And when I realized what a selfish
shit I'd been... Shut up, Dad!

01:21:15.247 --> 01:21:16.974
She took me back.
It's the truth.

01:21:16.999 --> 01:21:19.685
You couldn't tell me, Dad?
Really?

01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:21.979
You just made me hate her!

01:21:22.004 --> 01:21:25.274
She made me promise that if she
did something as stupid as I had

01:21:25.299 --> 01:21:27.484
she hoped I'd have the
decency to wait for her,

01:21:27.509 --> 01:21:28.986
so I am.

01:21:29.011 --> 01:21:31.488
I should have told you, Samantha.

01:21:31.513 --> 01:21:32.931
I'm sorry.

01:22:01.627 --> 01:22:03.212
I'm sorry.

01:22:08.717 --> 01:22:11.762
She waited six months, Dad.
You've been waiting three years.

01:22:13.889 --> 01:22:16.075
I think you made good on your promise.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.286
It's okay to stop waiting.

01:22:19.311 --> 01:22:25.793
Yeah... She's
coming back.

01:22:25.818 --> 01:22:28.796
What makes you so sure?

01:22:28.821 --> 01:22:30.923
Because she waited.

01:22:30.948 --> 01:22:34.535

person than I'll ever be.
