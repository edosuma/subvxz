WEBVTT

02:12.508 --> 02:14.718
- Can I help you with that?
- Please.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.303
All right,
give me a second.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.679
I'll have some milk in mine.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.681
- Here you go, Elmo.
- Thank you, ma'am.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.807
Bacon, egg and cheese,

02:20.849 --> 02:22.518
tomato hot sauce
and a black coffee.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.228
- You got that, Wendy?
- Thank you, darlin'.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.446
She's gonna put
all you lowlifes to shame.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.531
Who's callin' us lowlifes?

02:35.572 --> 02:36.949
Oh, I am.

02:38.909 --> 02:43.413
Everyone here is a lowlife
except my darling Wendy.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.831
You're such a sweetheart.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.835
You wanna throw an egg
for me? Come on.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.294
Throw it.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.508
They'd be lucky to have
that egg. One more?

02:55.968 --> 02:57.344
Throw it. Hard.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.471
- Yeah.
- Yay!

02:59.763 --> 03:01.932
When she's pitching
in the World Series,

03:01.974 --> 03:03.976
I will remember that egg.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.854
If she's anything
like her mom,

03:06.895 --> 03:08.021
she's gonna be a pitcher.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.190
I don't think so.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.740
Bacon for the birthday boy.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.537
You want your friend
Thomas' bacon, huh?

03:24.663 --> 03:26.665
Maybe they gonna
be politicians.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.083
Dream on, Ponts.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.838
When these kids grow up,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.215
they'll be running this place.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.092
That's right, kiddos.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.927
One day,
these little munchkins

03:38.969 --> 03:40.888
are gonna be moppin' up
after us.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.183
Huh, Douglas,
you could be the waiter...

03:44.224 --> 03:46.935
and, James,
you can be the cashier.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.312
No.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.732
Grandma, I could be a pirate?

03:51.773 --> 03:55.611
Pirate?
We're not hirin' for a pirate.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.863
You're gonna be
my mop and broom man.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.790
I ain't gonna be
no mop and broom man.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.877
Nobody wants
to be a mop and broom man.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.921
But that's damn sure
how we end up.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.756
You think Goose wanted to be

04:15.797 --> 04:17.673
a toilet scrubber
when he was eight?

04:17.716 --> 04:20.636
That's senior executive
toilet scrubber to you.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.305
Y'all quit
makin' fun of him.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.933
He wants to be a pirate,
he'll be a pirate.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.935
Are you
influencing my grandbaby?

04:27.976 --> 04:29.019
You get back, woman.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.021
- Go! Get! Get!
- Who do you think you are?

04:31.063 --> 04:32.189
I'm gonna fight you.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.273
She's got a knife!

04:48.580 --> 04:51.333
I ain't gonna be
no mop and broom man.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.725
Slow! Get off of me!

05:16.984 --> 05:18.735
You can take your mop

05:18.777 --> 05:20.696
and shove it
up your face hole!

05:27.327 --> 05:29.913
Hey! No Pants!

05:31.373 --> 05:32.374
Jump on the train.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.752
Hurry!

06:28.972 --> 06:31.141
<i>I will tell you the story</i>

06:31.183 --> 06:33.393
<i>of children who fly away...</i>

06:33.435 --> 06:35.604
<i>farther and farther,</i>

06:35.646 --> 06:38.023
<i>past the houses
and the restaurants...</i>

06:38.065 --> 06:41.193
past the deadly twizzlers
and earthquakes.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.655
Past the animal kingdom
and the flooded seas.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.200
<i>All the way
to the edge of the world.</i>

06:54.706 --> 06:57.084
<i>Oh, crap!
Watch out, Thomas.</i>

06:57.125 --> 06:59.169
<i>The grown-ups
are coming to stop us.</i>

06:59.211 --> 07:02.047
Pull out your katana,
kill those dudes.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.173
Protect the turtles.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.424
You too, train ghost.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.345
Throw those intestines
into the grinder.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.930
Yeah, you got 'em, Thomas.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.431
That's what you get, punk.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.518
Oh, no!
They've blown up the bridge!

07:14.560 --> 07:15.936
What are we gonna do?

07:21.149 --> 07:22.985
Up, up and away!

07:23.026 --> 07:24.945
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga,
choo-choo!

08:41.480 --> 08:43.857
<i>All children grow up.</i>

08:44.316 --> 08:46.235
I'll take the check
when you get a chance.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.156
<i>For most,
it just happens.</i>

08:51.198 --> 08:52.574
<i>Like a change in the weather.</i>

08:53.408 --> 08:55.536
Biscuits'll be ready
in five, Wendy.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.038
- You hear me?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.873
Okay, baby. Thank you.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.166
Thanks.

09:02.292 --> 09:07.798
<i>But some, the wild ones...</i>

09:12.052 --> 09:14.513
<i>the ones
with the light in their eye...</i>

09:16.932 --> 09:18.267
<i>escape.</i>

09:21.562 --> 09:23.063
All hail...

09:23.105 --> 09:25.315
- Stand aside for Immortal Don!
- Whoo!

09:25.357 --> 09:27.109
Get your muddy boots
out of here right now.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.193
Cha-ching!

09:28.235 --> 09:29.361
Come on.
Yeah, choose that one.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.445
Y'all come on.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.995
You're tracking dirt
all over my clean floor.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.414
You're not listening.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.999
All hail
to the turtle!

09:43.208 --> 09:45.085
Both of you, now!
Let's go.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.170
Listen to your mama.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.381
Sorry y'all couldn't enjoy
my awesome entertainment.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.049
- Go. You've gotta get to work.
- He's gonna bite you.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.259
- Watch out, Mom.
- I've been waiting

09:52.301 --> 09:53.343
- here forever.
- He's biting.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.137
Don't touch me with those.
Where did those come from? No.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.222
Next thing,
you'll ask me for a cigarette,

09:57.264 --> 09:58.974
can I put liquor
in your coffee...

09:59.016 --> 10:01.310
I'm gonna put both of you
on your ass.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.688
Ow! God!

10:06.273 --> 10:08.525
Move your biscuit
out of the way.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.031
No! No! Get off.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.617
Spider-Man!

10:18.785 --> 10:20.454
Tell us a story, woman.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.498
I can't.
I have to work, dudes.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.583
Come on.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.335
You never
tell us stories anymore.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.671
Okay. But just one.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.298
Yeah!

10:31.340 --> 10:33.717
Once upon a time,

10:33.759 --> 10:36.303
there was a little girl
and two twin boys.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.931
- Boring.
- That's lame.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.057
Next.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.434
Tell us a real one
from before we were born.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.061
No.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.522
Wendy,
Mom was a badass.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.525
She hitched
all the way to California...

10:49.566 --> 10:51.109
when she was only
one year older than me.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.194
Hush.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.530
And she stole a few cars
while she was at it.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.822
I said hush.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.245
What was your wildest dream
when you were my age?

11:02.204 --> 11:03.372
Hmm.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.124
Ridin' the rodeo.

11:08.544 --> 11:09.837
It's not funny.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.380
Why are y'all
making fun of it?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.507
I could have done it.

11:13.549 --> 11:14.675
I didn't know I was gonna have

11:14.716 --> 11:16.593
y'all little wild monsters
running around everywhere.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.852
What's your dream now?

11:27.437 --> 11:29.106
Taking care
of my child.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.026
Making sure I don't
screw y'all up too bad.

11:35.529 --> 11:36.655
That's it.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.618
Great dream, Mom.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.247
Come on.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.500
Things change, <i>chica.</i>

11:49.626 --> 11:51.044
Dreams change.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.425
Oh, my God.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.343
I have to go.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.803
Good night. I love y'all.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.516
Y'all better not be trashing
my kitchen down there.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.602
She probably still wants
to do all that stuff.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.062
Yep,
but she got too old.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.190
Don't say that.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.357
The more you grow up,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.526
the less things you get to do
that you wanna.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.612
It'll happen to you, too.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.780
I said don't talk about that!

12:22.034 --> 12:24.745
Jeez, Wendy.
I was just explaining life.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.547
Not my life.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.736
Mom,
I have a brilliant concept.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.987
Listen to this.
Listen to this.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.614
How about
we don't go to school?

13:00.656 --> 13:02.407
How about we do
what I say we do?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.786
Mom, it's a hellhole.
You're killing my inner child.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.746
Don't give me
that look. Let's go.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.255
Bye.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.396
Zing!

13:32.437 --> 13:35.774
Hurry up! It's over there.
Go before he...

13:38.735 --> 13:40.612
- Can I have a net?
- No!

13:42.322 --> 13:43.615
Look. See him? Right here.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.577
Look. Red-eared slider.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.579
Right there.
Underneath that grass.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.040
Oh, yeah.
That's a snapping turtle.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.503
How you gonna tell?
His head's tucked in.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.256
It's a snapping turtle.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.383
Look at his shell.
It got spikes on it.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.427
I'll bet you five dollars

14:03.468 --> 14:04.511
that's a red-eared slider.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.431
I bet all your pillows
it's a snapping turtle.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.267
All right,
let's find out.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.396
Now, he might be too far.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.816
I seen a few turtles
when we first got here.

14:24.823 --> 14:28.619
<i>Once there was
a haunted train.</i>

14:53.352 --> 14:56.688
Hey! Hey, we're here!

15:03.862 --> 15:07.115
<i>"Beware, children,"
it whispers.</i>

15:09.535 --> 15:12.579
<i>"The most terrible danger
is closing in."</i>

15:22.506 --> 15:25.634
Wendy! Come on!
We need you in here.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.011
I got dishes
fallin' out the sink.

15:30.848 --> 15:37.062
<i>Your life will go by,
and nothing will ever happen.</i>

16:00.043 --> 16:03.088
Mom, Wendy hypnotized
herself again.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.761
Aah! Aah!

16:13.348 --> 16:15.225
"Come, Wendy.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.644
"I'll teach you to fly
through the sky."

16:24.735 --> 16:26.820
"When are we going?"

16:26.862 --> 16:30.616
And the tiny star screamed,
"Now!"

17:15.868 --> 17:18.288
James, wake up.
You gotta see this!

17:18.329 --> 17:19.373
Go to sleep.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.540
Come on!

17:31.385 --> 17:33.512
Someone's out there!

17:33.554 --> 17:34.972
I told you!

17:44.439 --> 17:45.649
Wendy, wait!

17:46.358 --> 17:47.442
Come on, Doug!

17:47.484 --> 17:50.696
Are you crazy?
What about the turtles?

17:50.737 --> 17:51.864
Mom will feed them.

17:51.905 --> 17:52.990
What about Mom?

17:53.031 --> 17:54.324
We gotta go.

18:00.581 --> 18:02.165
Wendy,
you can't jump that.

18:04.710 --> 18:05.752
Shit!

18:14.803 --> 18:16.346
Wendy, you're nuts.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.432
What's our stop?

19:01.266 --> 19:04.186
This is an adventure,
there are no stops.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.234
Just kidding. Not kidding.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.569
Kidding.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.552
<i>He says
the world has no end.</i>

19:38.262 --> 19:40.472
<i>It goes on and on forever.</i>

19:46.562 --> 19:49.439
<i>Past the houses
and the restaurants.</i>

19:51.275 --> 19:53.485
<i>Past all the billions
of people</i>

19:53.527 --> 19:55.195
<i>who never dared to leave.</i>

20:01.618 --> 20:03.537
What are you looking for?

20:27.561 --> 20:31.273
Everyone,
stand there by the edge.

20:34.735 --> 20:35.736
All right.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.550
Come on, Doug-O.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.601
- Ha-ha!
- What the hell?

21:07.643 --> 21:09.520
Fly!

21:23.784 --> 21:24.993
Douglas!

21:26.078 --> 21:27.287
James!

21:27.746 --> 21:29.581
Cannonball!

21:30.958 --> 21:32.709
Are y'all all right?

21:33.377 --> 21:35.170
Yeah! You okay?

21:49.726 --> 21:50.727
Hey!

21:56.817 --> 21:58.277
Give me your hand.

22:01.488 --> 22:04.366
Why you bringing in
this fish bait?

22:04.408 --> 22:07.119
Cudjoe Head,
help her on the boat.

22:07.536 --> 22:09.037
Uh-uh.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.081
She don't stand a chance.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.492
Hey, Mother!

24:10.534 --> 24:12.494
Happy to see you, too!

24:13.370 --> 24:15.247
Are we going there?

24:15.289 --> 24:16.623
Of course.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.135
<i>Remember the voice
in your head?</i>

24:37.769 --> 24:40.105
<i>The one that said,</i>

24:40.147 --> 24:44.484
<i>"Sneak away into the night."</i>

24:47.154 --> 24:49.364
<i>Here is the place
it came from.</i>

24:53.327 --> 24:55.454
So long, jerks.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.498
Ahoy, moron.

24:59.625 --> 25:00.918
Let's go.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.519
I'm gonna
cut your foot off

25:18.560 --> 25:19.770
and shove it up your butt!

25:21.939 --> 25:23.524
Hey, wait!

25:31.198 --> 25:32.199
Wendy!

25:33.200 --> 25:35.244
Over here! Come on!

25:35.827 --> 25:36.995
Where'd they go?

25:37.037 --> 25:38.288
I don't know.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.253
Ahhh! Shit!

26:18.745 --> 26:21.290
I'm a big bear.
I'm a werewolf.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.419
Get me mad.
Watch what happens.

26:37.848 --> 26:39.516
Badass.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.061
Wendy. Wendy.

27:20.849 --> 27:22.684
Y'all got the same face.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.188
So?

27:26.605 --> 27:28.398
Your name Two-Boy?

27:29.107 --> 27:31.276
- No.
- My name's Douglas.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.862
Y'all got someone
looking for you?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.406
My mama, I guess.

27:37.241 --> 27:39.368
My mama named me Sweet Heavy.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.205
And all I do
is play with the volcano.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.708
Is that all you got?

27:49.086 --> 27:51.672
That was terrible.

27:53.674 --> 27:55.008
Watch this.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.460
Come on.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.174
Come on, come get me.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.967
Come and get me.
I'm right here.

28:37.009 --> 28:38.218
Come on, Wendy.
Come on, let's go!

28:38.260 --> 28:39.303
Hurry, run!

28:39.344 --> 28:40.345
Yeah!

28:44.266 --> 28:45.434
Go, guys!

28:51.607 --> 28:53.984
Blackbeard's coming!

28:54.026 --> 28:55.360
Blackbeard?

28:55.402 --> 28:56.945
Run for your lives!

29:04.578 --> 29:05.954
Thomas?

29:10.709 --> 29:12.252
Surrender!

29:12.711 --> 29:14.671
Thomas,
what are you doing?

29:15.756 --> 29:18.008
I'll take your soul
right out of your body!

29:18.425 --> 29:19.718
And I'll crack your neck...

29:19.760 --> 29:22.429
and I'll use your fingers
for a necklace.

29:22.471 --> 29:24.932
Thomas Marshall,
I'm James Darling.

29:24.973 --> 29:27.935
I'm not Thomas.
I am Blackbeard.

29:30.187 --> 29:31.813
You lived next door.

29:32.648 --> 29:34.441
Mwa-ha-ha!

29:45.202 --> 29:46.954
Why didn't he grow up?

30:12.813 --> 30:14.481
When I push the button,

30:14.523 --> 30:16.024
your little brother's
gonna laugh.

31:02.613 --> 31:04.281
What's he doin'?

31:05.407 --> 31:08.035
Peter's talking to the Mother.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.053
What's she saying
to you?

31:26.887 --> 31:28.305
Shh.

31:29.097 --> 31:30.432
Just listen.

31:42.110 --> 31:43.153
Come on.

31:44.696 --> 31:46.698
I'll be your best friend.

31:59.503 --> 32:00.796
Come.

35:38.305 --> 35:39.806
Oh, my God!

35:39.848 --> 35:42.518
This is freaking nuts.
Ahhh!

35:44.603 --> 35:47.356
She's impossible!

36:01.870 --> 36:04.623
<i>When the first child laughed,</i>

36:04.665 --> 36:06.375
<i>for the first time...</i>

36:09.378 --> 36:13.340
<i>the sound broke
into a million glowing pieces.</i>

36:17.970 --> 36:20.973
<i>And the Mother rose up</i>

36:21.014 --> 36:22.766
<i>from the center
of the Earth...</i>

36:22.808 --> 36:24.518
<i>to watch over them.</i>

36:29.356 --> 36:31.525
<i>She was always here...</i>

36:33.026 --> 36:35.028
<i>and always will be.</i>

36:37.406 --> 36:39.700
<i>And as long
as you believe in her...</i>

36:42.077 --> 36:47.916
<i>you will never, ever grow up.</i>

37:45.182 --> 37:48.018
Swear on the Mother.
We will never grow up.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.686
We'll never grow up!

37:51.688 --> 37:54.399
Never!

37:58.153 --> 37:59.363
Faster! Faster!

38:21.385 --> 38:24.596
Last one to fly
is a rotten egg.

38:29.142 --> 38:30.936
Did you bust
your head wide open?

38:30.978 --> 38:32.312
I did bust my head.

38:36.358 --> 38:38.527
Get it, Wendy!

38:40.279 --> 38:43.365
Tell Mama I'm just staying
a little longer.

38:45.826 --> 38:48.370
And tell her that I'm being
wild as hell...

38:48.412 --> 38:51.248
and that when I come back,
I'm gonna show her how.

38:55.043 --> 38:57.754
And tell her I miss her
and I love her.

38:58.422 --> 38:59.715
Now fly home.

39:10.559 --> 39:13.562
I'll throw one stone
for every secret I have.

39:14.229 --> 39:19.818
One, two,
three, four, five.

39:20.861 --> 39:22.029
Whoa! Big one.

39:22.070 --> 39:24.072
It sure is.

39:24.489 --> 39:28.702
<i>The sun goes up
and the sun goes down...</i>

39:28.744 --> 39:31.163
<i>but no one bothers to count
how many times.</i>

39:37.836 --> 39:40.214
And so began
the Legend of Peter.

39:41.673 --> 39:44.218
The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up.

41:10.137 --> 41:11.805
When did you draw
this one?

41:14.266 --> 41:15.601
Don't remember.

41:21.565 --> 41:23.400
I sink way, way down

41:23.442 --> 41:25.777
and the Mother brought me
back here.

41:34.286 --> 41:36.413
Is this your family?

41:42.169 --> 41:43.253
Dang.

41:51.929 --> 41:54.348
Why'd they leave you behind?

41:55.807 --> 41:58.519
I ran away,
and no one could find me.

42:00.395 --> 42:02.523
I bet they looked for you.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.858
Probably for years.

43:35.699 --> 43:36.700
Hello?

43:40.412 --> 43:41.622
Hey, wait!

43:43.165 --> 43:44.333
Stop!

44:02.643 --> 44:04.228
Not another step.

44:06.939 --> 44:08.232
What is this?

44:08.273 --> 44:09.900
We don't go over there.

44:10.776 --> 44:12.653
You shouldn't even be here.

44:17.366 --> 44:18.825
Hi, Buzzo.

44:22.204 --> 44:23.997
You know him, Thomas?

44:24.498 --> 44:26.416
That could be Buzzo.

44:27.584 --> 44:29.920
That's not Buzzo.

44:34.383 --> 44:36.718
I'm still Buzzo.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.179
You are not Buzzo!

44:39.221 --> 44:42.057
I'm still Buzzo, Peter!

44:48.689 --> 44:50.357
What happened to him?

44:50.399 --> 44:51.900
He lost his best friend,

44:51.942 --> 44:54.653
and his number
started going up and up.

44:54.695 --> 44:56.697
He couldn't stop it.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.825
Could that happen to us?

45:05.956 --> 45:07.499
Bye, Buzzo.

45:14.965 --> 45:18.177
<i>It turns out
there are rules here.</i>

45:18.218 --> 45:20.179
That had to be Buzzo.
It had Buzzo's clothes.

45:20.220 --> 45:21.263
Buzzo's short.

45:21.305 --> 45:22.347
That was not Buzzo.

45:22.389 --> 45:23.432
Buzzo's gone.

45:23.473 --> 45:25.058
<i>Never slow down.</i>

45:26.059 --> 45:27.227
<i>Never think twice.</i>

45:27.269 --> 45:28.562
You coming?

45:29.897 --> 45:31.565
<i>When sad thoughts
fill your mind...</i>

45:34.151 --> 45:37.279
<i>let them whizz out
the other ear and be gone.</i>

45:37.321 --> 45:40.616
Come on.
All aboard to the pirate ship.

45:47.539 --> 45:48.957
I call shotgun!

45:52.127 --> 45:53.587
I call first.

45:54.379 --> 45:57.007
Patch her up,
and we could sail away.

46:09.228 --> 46:10.395
<i>Mañana.</i>

46:10.437 --> 46:11.939
<i>Mañana.</i>

46:11.980 --> 46:13.565
Quite a weird name.

46:30.207 --> 46:32.125
There's no way
to the front.

46:32.793 --> 46:35.420
There's a door underwater.
Come on.

46:37.673 --> 46:39.132
There is.

46:42.761 --> 46:44.930
I bet we could swim
straight through.

46:45.264 --> 46:46.598
Hell, no.

46:47.182 --> 46:49.309
What if there's
pirate treasure in there?

46:50.185 --> 46:52.729
There might be a skull
or something.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.940
Are you scared?

46:54.982 --> 46:56.650
You suck, man.

46:59.027 --> 47:00.028
Wendy.

47:01.530 --> 47:03.365
Stay here. Okay?

47:04.324 --> 47:05.367
I'm going.

47:05.409 --> 47:06.451
No, please!

47:40.736 --> 47:42.279
This place is awesome.

47:51.997 --> 47:53.332
Doug-O!

48:00.506 --> 48:02.090
What the hell?

48:07.095 --> 48:10.182
I can't find him!

48:10.224 --> 48:12.851
James, where is he?

48:14.937 --> 48:16.522
Did you see him?

48:18.232 --> 48:19.858
I don't see him!

48:40.838 --> 48:42.339
Douglas!

48:42.673 --> 48:44.967
- Doug-O!
- Come help us!

48:45.467 --> 48:47.678
Doug-O!
- Get out from there.

48:48.136 --> 48:49.137
Help!

48:51.849 --> 48:52.975
Doug!

48:53.016 --> 48:55.018
- He can swim!
- Douglas!

48:55.060 --> 48:56.562
Don't worry, he's not gone.

48:56.603 --> 48:57.980
Get off me!

49:01.149 --> 49:02.442
Calm down.

49:02.484 --> 49:04.486
Mother don't let nothin'
happen to her children.

49:06.947 --> 49:08.907
You have to trust me.

49:15.372 --> 49:16.874
He's okay!

49:42.858 --> 49:45.027
Doug-O, where are you?

49:46.361 --> 49:49.781
- Doug-O?
- Doug-O! Doug-O!

49:54.369 --> 49:56.038
Doug-O!

50:00.250 --> 50:04.755
<i>This is the story
of Two-Boy broke apart.</i>

50:07.966 --> 50:10.636
<i>All that was left was a half.</i>

50:11.678 --> 50:13.347
Come on, keep going.

50:23.982 --> 50:26.443
<i>His heart cracked
right down the middle...</i>

50:30.239 --> 50:33.158
<i>and all the joy spilled out.</i>

51:17.494 --> 51:18.912
James.

51:20.330 --> 51:21.498
James!

51:37.264 --> 51:39.474
We've got to go to the cave!

51:44.605 --> 51:45.898
Don't tell!

52:01.121 --> 52:02.456
Doug-O!

52:07.211 --> 52:08.712
Doug-O!

52:54.633 --> 52:56.093
What the hell?

53:01.849 --> 53:03.267
James, look!

53:08.188 --> 53:09.273
Damn.

53:29.710 --> 53:30.961
Help! Hurry!

53:31.003 --> 53:32.504
Hey! Give it back!

53:34.298 --> 53:35.757
Two-Boy!

53:36.133 --> 53:37.467
Leave me alone!

53:37.926 --> 53:39.761
James stole the sword!

53:40.929 --> 53:42.222
- James!
- Stop him!

53:43.348 --> 53:44.391
Hurry!

53:44.433 --> 53:46.143
What happened?

53:46.185 --> 53:47.311
James, stop!

53:47.352 --> 53:49.396
What'd I say?
Get off of there!

53:51.899 --> 53:53.108
That's mine!

53:53.775 --> 53:55.277
Give it!

54:11.835 --> 54:13.337
You have to help me.

54:18.342 --> 54:21.428
I swore to my brother.
I can't grow up.

54:23.555 --> 54:25.140
You gotta cut it off.

54:25.182 --> 54:27.309
It's not a toy! Put it down!

54:27.601 --> 54:29.478
He won't really chop it.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.689
Who says I won't?
I'll do whatever I want!

54:40.072 --> 54:41.949
You believe it will work?

54:44.159 --> 54:45.202
I believe.

54:45.244 --> 54:46.537
James, don't be crazy!

54:46.578 --> 54:47.913
Stay out of this, Wendy!

54:53.919 --> 54:56.421
Doubt yourself
and you're old already.

55:08.559 --> 55:09.560
Ready?

55:12.396 --> 55:13.772
Steady.

55:17.568 --> 55:19.027
- Now!
- James!

55:22.281 --> 55:23.949
No!

55:36.628 --> 55:37.880
Look! It's working!

55:39.506 --> 55:40.632
It's not working!

55:43.719 --> 55:44.803
You have to believe.

55:46.054 --> 55:47.389
We're gonna
get you help.

55:47.431 --> 55:49.558
Real help from grown-ups.

55:51.560 --> 55:52.644
Run!

56:02.738 --> 56:03.739
Come on!

56:05.199 --> 56:06.992
We've gotta find help.

56:21.131 --> 56:22.424
James, look.

56:34.311 --> 56:37.981
Hey! Are you out there?

56:38.023 --> 56:40.776
Hey! Help us!

56:48.867 --> 56:50.118
Buzzo?

56:52.788 --> 56:54.748
Why are you hiding, you idiot?

57:00.587 --> 57:01.880
Come on!

57:05.300 --> 57:07.678
- You're not afraid of me?
- No!

57:14.059 --> 57:15.644
Come on, buddy, let's go!

57:15.686 --> 57:18.397
All right.
Hold your horses.

57:25.779 --> 57:28.115
Boy, you're hurt
pretty good there.

57:28.782 --> 57:30.701
Do you know anyone
that can help him?

57:30.742 --> 57:33.745
Oh, do me a favor.
Don't worry so darn much.

57:33.787 --> 57:35.998
You wanna get old like me?

57:39.001 --> 57:41.545
All right, give me a hand.

57:42.588 --> 57:44.631
We'll take care of him.

57:45.340 --> 57:47.926
Japan, giddy-up your hiney.

57:51.263 --> 57:53.056
Oh, damn it.

57:55.142 --> 57:57.102
Give me a hand here.

58:05.736 --> 58:07.404
All right, Japan, come on.

58:08.572 --> 58:09.656
Come on.

58:12.409 --> 58:13.493
Come on.

58:21.627 --> 58:23.253
So what'd you wanna
talk about?

58:49.321 --> 58:51.823
You know that dirt's got
dead people in it?

58:52.407 --> 58:58.121
Back in the day, this place
was filled up with people.

58:58.163 --> 58:59.248
Come on.

59:00.290 --> 59:05.212
And then, old Betsy up there
blew her cookies...

59:06.880 --> 59:09.007
and toasted their butts.

59:11.093 --> 59:12.928
Did only Peter make it out?

59:13.720 --> 59:16.223
Uh, some jumped ship.

59:16.807 --> 59:19.268
Went to Boston. Hartford.

59:20.310 --> 59:21.770
The rest, they on the...

59:21.812 --> 59:23.772
Stuck to your sneaker
right there.

59:27.442 --> 59:30.320
By and by,
that's where we all go.

59:30.821 --> 59:32.614
One day you're Buzzo,

59:32.656 --> 59:35.242
and the next day
you're a pile of sand.

1:00:06.607 --> 1:00:08.150
What's it feel like?

1:00:10.444 --> 1:00:14.281
Uh, kind of like nothing.
And that's the worst part.

1:00:16.116 --> 1:00:21.538
You don't have no fever,
and you got no bellyache.

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:24.541
And the only reason
you know you're old

1:00:24.583 --> 1:00:27.252
is nobody will talk
to you no more.

1:00:29.421 --> 1:00:33.133
And the older you feel,
the faster it goes.

1:00:35.677 --> 1:00:38.180
I'm gonna help y'all
feel young again.

1:00:39.765 --> 1:00:41.266
You're better off to learn

1:00:41.308 --> 1:00:43.477
not to become too attached.

1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:49.900
I don't wanna learn that.

1:01:29.189 --> 1:01:32.442
This is where Lost Boys
go when they're really lost.

1:02:10.439 --> 1:02:12.608
Does Peter know about this?

1:02:14.318 --> 1:02:16.570
Peter knows
what he wants to know.

1:02:27.789 --> 1:02:29.291
Slow it down.

1:02:31.877 --> 1:02:33.420
<i>Beware, children.</i>

1:02:36.757 --> 1:02:38.884
<i>You can leave yourself behind.</i>

1:02:41.261 --> 1:02:43.263
<i>You won't even know
when it happened.</i>

1:02:50.896 --> 1:02:52.898
<i>Was it a look away...</i>

1:02:53.815 --> 1:02:55.609
<i>or a lie you told?</i>

1:02:57.694 --> 1:03:00.072
<i>Did someone
treat you unfairly?</i>

1:03:05.619 --> 1:03:07.454
<i>When you lose yourself...</i>

1:03:08.539 --> 1:03:11.083
<i>the Mother can no longer
protect you.</i>

1:03:18.006 --> 1:03:20.342
Why y'all killing these fish?

1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:24.429
We ain't even fishing
for fish.

1:03:24.471 --> 1:03:26.974
We're fishing for the Mother,
see?

1:03:28.350 --> 1:03:30.727
The old folks say
if you eat her,

1:03:30.769 --> 1:03:32.437
you get young again.

1:03:36.483 --> 1:03:38.402
You wouldn't hurt her,
would you?

1:03:39.611 --> 1:03:43.031
Not like we could
walk up to her and say hi.

1:03:43.073 --> 1:03:44.533
If we get her glow,

1:03:44.575 --> 1:03:46.243
we'll go back
to the way we were.

1:04:13.312 --> 1:04:15.772
Does anyone know
how to stop this?

1:04:26.283 --> 1:04:27.993
Y'all wouldn't be so miserable

1:04:28.035 --> 1:04:29.745
if you'd just talk
to each other.

1:04:39.922 --> 1:04:41.465
What do you want?

1:04:43.133 --> 1:04:44.676
Whatever you got.

1:04:47.262 --> 1:04:49.640
I'm making you
a blueberry cocktail

1:04:49.681 --> 1:04:51.934
with a pinch of margarita.

1:04:53.977 --> 1:04:55.687
There you go, darlin'.

1:05:04.071 --> 1:05:07.824
Seafood gumbo, curly fries,
lots of ketchup.

1:05:09.660 --> 1:05:11.036
Dr. Pepper.

1:05:11.954 --> 1:05:13.288
It's your favorite.

1:05:16.792 --> 1:05:19.211
It could be like
we're just back at home.

1:05:20.546 --> 1:05:22.047
I'm not going home.

1:05:24.383 --> 1:05:26.051
You can't lose hope.

1:05:26.093 --> 1:05:28.178
That's what's making you old.

1:05:54.997 --> 1:05:56.665
Come on, Brother James.

1:06:00.752 --> 1:06:04.131
Come on, Brother James.
Show 'em you can bust a move.

1:06:13.265 --> 1:06:15.100
Oh, I don't know.

1:06:15.142 --> 1:06:16.351
All right.

1:06:23.775 --> 1:06:25.068
Come on, now.

1:06:27.487 --> 1:06:29.406
I don't hear anything.

1:06:30.282 --> 1:06:32.701
You have to use
your imagination.

1:06:33.285 --> 1:06:35.537
What if we don't have one?

1:06:35.579 --> 1:06:37.497
Everyone has one.

1:06:37.539 --> 1:06:39.708
Come on, let's get it.

1:06:42.669 --> 1:06:45.005
Hey! All right. Let's get it.

1:06:55.557 --> 1:06:57.267
James, come back!

1:06:57.309 --> 1:06:58.769
Go away, Wendy!

1:06:58.810 --> 1:07:00.020
Where are you going?

1:07:00.062 --> 1:07:02.272
- James!
- Leave me alone!

1:07:08.237 --> 1:07:10.531
Y'all just don't know
how to fish.

1:07:13.408 --> 1:07:16.119
Hey, this dude knows
how to fish!

1:07:22.793 --> 1:07:24.670
What's the plan, boss?

1:07:37.432 --> 1:07:39.643
To catch a fish,
you need bait, right?

1:07:40.978 --> 1:07:44.606
To catch the Mother,
you need to take her kids.

1:07:47.985 --> 1:07:50.237
A mother will always come
for her children.

1:07:57.244 --> 1:08:00.247
Mothers always come
for their children.

1:08:01.957 --> 1:08:03.917
Buzzo!

1:08:08.797 --> 1:08:10.924
James, tell them to stop.

1:08:13.093 --> 1:08:17.471
James! You're good! Be good!

1:08:26.523 --> 1:08:29.359
Leave her!
Go get the others!

1:10:05.706 --> 1:10:08.959
<i>When you're a child,
they don't tell you.</i>

1:10:13.255 --> 1:10:16.633
<i>Everyone you love
can disappear.</i>

1:10:19.136 --> 1:10:21.305
<i>And you never get them back.</i>

1:10:23.307 --> 1:10:25.017
They're all gone!

1:10:25.058 --> 1:10:26.935
<i>Take care of your tribe.</i>

1:10:27.603 --> 1:10:30.939
<i>Make sure nothing bad
ever happens to them.</i>

1:10:33.567 --> 1:10:36.820
Stop!
Peter! Help! Peter!

1:10:36.862 --> 1:10:39.114
I got one.
I got one here.

1:10:40.407 --> 1:10:43.035
Let me go! Stop!

1:10:43.076 --> 1:10:44.369
Help me!

1:10:55.047 --> 1:10:56.131
Peter!

1:11:04.223 --> 1:11:05.432
Wait!

1:11:06.225 --> 1:11:08.227
We gotta go back for them!

1:11:09.645 --> 1:11:11.188
Would you turn around?

1:11:11.688 --> 1:11:13.857
Two-Boy is our enemy now.

1:11:13.899 --> 1:11:15.317
That's my brother!

1:11:15.359 --> 1:11:17.027
Now he's wicked.

1:11:17.069 --> 1:11:19.154
You cut off his hand,
you ass-face!

1:11:19.738 --> 1:11:21.657
You went to the Olds.

1:11:21.698 --> 1:11:24.826
There's nothing wrong
with being old!

1:11:24.868 --> 1:11:26.745
I should've never chose you!

1:11:29.331 --> 1:11:30.707
Get away!

1:11:42.052 --> 1:11:44.221
You never believe
in me enough.

1:11:44.263 --> 1:11:47.015
Yeah, 'cause nothing you say
ever works.

1:11:59.403 --> 1:12:00.821
You're coming or what?

1:12:06.201 --> 1:12:07.578
Where are we going?

1:12:08.704 --> 1:12:12.124
Ask less questions,
you get more answers.

1:12:33.562 --> 1:12:34.605
Come on.

1:12:46.950 --> 1:12:49.244
Come on, people,
stuff 'em in there.

1:12:49.286 --> 1:12:50.704
We got more here.

1:12:50.746 --> 1:12:53.457
We gotta get this up
by dinnertime.

1:12:53.498 --> 1:12:56.502
Come on, you old codger.
Put a pep in your step.

1:12:57.211 --> 1:12:59.671
We ain't gonna live forever.

1:12:59.713 --> 1:13:02.299
Shove those nanny goats
in there.

1:13:02.341 --> 1:13:03.342
Keep 'em flowing.

1:13:12.684 --> 1:13:13.852
Pull! Pull!

1:13:13.894 --> 1:13:16.480
Pull! Pull! Pull!

1:14:28.385 --> 1:14:30.721
Wendy,
you let the sadness in.

1:14:35.809 --> 1:14:39.146
You're not like him.
You know how to believe.

1:14:39.188 --> 1:14:40.522
From here.

1:14:50.824 --> 1:14:52.701
Leave me alone!
Get off me!

1:14:52.743 --> 1:14:53.911
Help!

1:14:54.578 --> 1:14:55.746
Get away!

1:14:58.707 --> 1:15:00.250
Get off me!

1:15:00.292 --> 1:15:01.293
Peter!

1:15:02.711 --> 1:15:03.754
Peter!

1:15:03.795 --> 1:15:05.214
Tie up those boys!

1:15:05.255 --> 1:15:06.465
Get him, get him!

1:15:06.507 --> 1:15:08.258
Hold him down! Hold him down!

1:15:13.347 --> 1:15:15.307
Tell 'em to man the oars!

1:15:17.559 --> 1:15:19.561
Wendy, we got to save them.

1:15:22.022 --> 1:15:23.565
Help!

1:15:23.607 --> 1:15:25.776
Leave me alone! Get off of me!

1:15:28.695 --> 1:15:30.280
Want to fly?

1:15:35.494 --> 1:15:39.206
We can fly? Really fly?

1:15:40.749 --> 1:15:43.252
Just believe in yourself
and jump.

1:15:57.975 --> 1:15:59.142
Ready?

1:16:03.313 --> 1:16:04.815
Fly!

1:16:24.877 --> 1:16:25.919
Peter!

1:17:46.792 --> 1:17:49.962
It worked.
We fly down through the water.

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:30.711
Mother's saying
you can stay here forever.

1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:34.506
You can have everything
in the world that you want.

1:19:02.743 --> 1:19:06.121
How do you know
when someone is a real mother?

1:19:11.210 --> 1:19:14.171
'Cause they love you the most
no matter what.

1:19:18.091 --> 1:19:19.927
I think...

1:19:19.968 --> 1:19:22.763
I think you're my mother
and I'm your father.

1:19:25.349 --> 1:19:27.351
That's not how it works.

1:19:29.186 --> 1:19:31.897
Then we'll both be
each other's mother.

1:19:33.815 --> 1:19:35.859
I already have a mother.

1:19:39.029 --> 1:19:41.281
One day,
she'll be gone though.

1:19:41.323 --> 1:19:44.201
No, she won't. Don't say that.

1:20:05.389 --> 1:20:06.682
You drew that?

1:20:57.149 --> 1:20:58.150
Doug-O!

1:21:07.743 --> 1:21:09.369
I knew you were alive!

1:21:15.125 --> 1:21:17.127
I'm gonna
gouge out your eyes

1:21:17.169 --> 1:21:18.712
and feed you to cannibals!

1:21:18.754 --> 1:21:21.048
And I'm gonna throw your body
in a river...

1:21:21.089 --> 1:21:24.468
and poke it a million,
gazillion times!

1:21:29.973 --> 1:21:32.100
And no one will ever find you!

1:21:34.895 --> 1:21:36.271
Where's James?

1:21:38.232 --> 1:21:39.566
He got sick.

1:21:41.276 --> 1:21:43.237
Wendy,
we have to go home.

1:21:44.780 --> 1:21:45.989
I know.

1:21:46.031 --> 1:21:47.241
Is he okay?

1:21:48.367 --> 1:21:49.993
He will be
when he sees you.

1:21:51.036 --> 1:21:52.246
Right, Peter?

1:21:54.289 --> 1:21:55.374
Come on.

1:22:09.763 --> 1:22:11.640
There's no one on there.

1:22:11.682 --> 1:22:12.975
Don't trust it.

1:22:36.582 --> 1:22:37.791
What the hell?

1:22:43.005 --> 1:22:44.715
Grab that little sucker.

1:22:44.756 --> 1:22:46.800
Let me go!

1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:50.512
James, we got two more.

1:22:51.930 --> 1:22:54.850
Quit it! Let me go!

1:22:57.102 --> 1:22:58.103
Stop!

1:23:37.476 --> 1:23:38.477
James.

1:23:45.192 --> 1:23:46.777
That ain't James.

1:23:52.908 --> 1:23:54.826
I couldn't stop it.

1:24:07.256 --> 1:24:09.508
You stayed young without me.

1:24:11.510 --> 1:24:13.262
How did you do it?

1:24:22.604 --> 1:24:24.606
I don't know how.

1:24:24.648 --> 1:24:26.775
How'd you do it without me?

1:24:57.973 --> 1:25:00.601
James, you gotta
remember who you are.

1:25:03.770 --> 1:25:05.731
Do you remember home?

1:25:09.610 --> 1:25:11.403
Do you remember Mama?

1:25:13.405 --> 1:25:15.657
That was a long time ago.

1:25:46.647 --> 1:25:48.690
Look! Over there!

1:25:48.732 --> 1:25:52.361
Mother's off
the starboard port bow!

1:26:19.137 --> 1:26:22.432
What? James, don't! Stop that!

1:26:24.643 --> 1:26:26.436
Stop! No!

1:26:26.478 --> 1:26:28.146
Peter!

1:26:28.188 --> 1:26:29.439
Hey, it's Peter!

1:26:29.481 --> 1:26:31.275
You'll never kill my mother!

1:26:35.070 --> 1:26:36.405
Get them, Peter!

1:26:49.084 --> 1:26:50.961
No!

1:26:52.421 --> 1:26:54.089
Stop! No!

1:27:05.767 --> 1:27:07.477
Don't hurt her!

1:27:07.519 --> 1:27:08.812
No!

1:27:08.854 --> 1:27:11.899
You're still young.
You don't understand.

1:27:13.192 --> 1:27:14.776
Don't hurt her!

1:27:17.362 --> 1:27:18.405
Stop it!

1:27:22.910 --> 1:27:23.994
No!

1:27:35.672 --> 1:27:37.716
Throw it now,
throw it now! Come on.

1:27:53.524 --> 1:27:56.276
She's slowing down!
I'm going in there!

1:28:04.451 --> 1:28:05.661
I'll get you out!

1:28:05.702 --> 1:28:06.745
Come on!

1:28:06.787 --> 1:28:08.121
Let's go! Let's go!

1:28:08.163 --> 1:28:09.665
We gotta save the Mother!

1:28:11.834 --> 1:28:12.835
Now!

1:28:18.632 --> 1:28:20.259
Pull! Pull!

1:28:22.469 --> 1:28:23.679
Pull!

1:28:46.660 --> 1:28:48.120
Take a bite!

1:29:04.344 --> 1:29:05.429
James!

1:29:05.470 --> 1:29:06.763
Somebody do something!

1:29:06.805 --> 1:29:08.307
Peter, save her!

1:30:12.037 --> 1:30:13.622
I don't understand.

1:31:16.310 --> 1:31:17.936
She loved me.

1:31:29.656 --> 1:31:32.326
I can't stay young
without my mother.

1:31:35.704 --> 1:31:37.247
I'll get old.

1:31:38.498 --> 1:31:40.292
That's not your story.

1:32:08.278 --> 1:32:10.447
Once there was a mother.

1:32:16.578 --> 1:32:18.747
She lived in a restaurant.

1:32:22.084 --> 1:32:24.253
And one day, her children,

1:32:24.294 --> 1:32:26.421
who she loved the most
in the world...

1:32:26.463 --> 1:32:29.049
ran away and left her alone.

1:32:31.301 --> 1:32:33.846
Did any of them
ever come home?

1:32:35.597 --> 1:32:37.641
Yes, they did.

1:32:38.892 --> 1:32:42.104
And they grew up all together
at Darling's Diner.

1:32:42.145 --> 1:32:44.815
Where it's always egg-o-clock.

1:32:47.150 --> 1:32:49.152
She wore a white apron.

1:32:49.987 --> 1:32:51.864
Yes, she did.

1:32:53.031 --> 1:32:54.867
She sang us to sleep.

1:32:57.911 --> 1:32:59.872
It's not a story.

1:32:59.913 --> 1:33:01.832
It is a story.

1:33:01.874 --> 1:33:05.043
Our lives are gonna be
the greatest story ever told!

1:33:05.961 --> 1:33:07.546
And the bigger we get,

1:33:07.588 --> 1:33:10.007
the more huger
our stories will be.

1:33:11.216 --> 1:33:14.511
We'll explore the earth
and mend the planet!

1:33:15.721 --> 1:33:17.139
We'll fall in love,

1:33:17.181 --> 1:33:19.808
and someday,
we get our own kids.

1:33:19.850 --> 1:33:21.894
A great army of them.

1:33:22.978 --> 1:33:25.397
And Doug-O's sons
and daughters running around,

1:33:25.439 --> 1:33:26.732
butt-ass naked.

1:33:26.773 --> 1:33:28.525
Yeah, that's right.

1:33:28.567 --> 1:33:29.735
Are they bad?

1:33:29.776 --> 1:33:30.861
They're horrible.

1:33:30.903 --> 1:33:32.112
Are they dirty?

1:33:32.154 --> 1:33:34.907
They smell like the last fart
of a dead donkey!

1:33:46.210 --> 1:33:49.004
But how do I do it
and never get old?

1:33:53.133 --> 1:33:54.927
It's impossible.

1:33:57.387 --> 1:33:58.931
Impossible?

1:35:10.377 --> 1:35:11.545
Wendy...

1:35:13.130 --> 1:35:15.048
I just think of something.

1:35:17.384 --> 1:35:19.720
To grow up
is a great adventure.

1:35:34.526 --> 1:35:35.903
It's working.

1:35:37.404 --> 1:35:38.906
It's working!

1:35:38.947 --> 1:35:40.073
Keep singing!

1:36:42.386 --> 1:36:44.513
I love my mother!

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.682
I love my mother.

1:36:46.723 --> 1:36:48.433
I love my mother.

1:36:49.226 --> 1:36:50.561
I love my mother.

1:37:00.529 --> 1:37:03.991
Even when she leaves me.
Even when she dies.

1:37:04.032 --> 1:37:05.993
I love her more.

1:37:09.788 --> 1:37:11.874
If you love your mother,
sing out.

1:37:11.915 --> 1:37:13.292
If you love
your mother, sing out!

1:37:13.333 --> 1:37:16.253
If you love your mother,
sing out!

1:38:07.095 --> 1:38:08.388
I can't go home.

1:38:18.148 --> 1:38:19.399
I know.

1:38:31.703 --> 1:38:33.330
I have a plan.

1:38:41.630 --> 1:38:43.048
Wicked man!

1:38:45.592 --> 1:38:48.387
You think you could
kill my mother?

1:38:51.473 --> 1:38:53.308
Will he ever come home?

1:38:54.434 --> 1:38:56.979
Never. Ever.

1:38:57.938 --> 1:38:59.064
Ever.

1:39:00.399 --> 1:39:01.400
Ever.

1:39:04.486 --> 1:39:07.489
I have to kill
this pirate Two-Boy.

1:39:11.451 --> 1:39:13.579
Two-Boy's dead!

1:39:14.454 --> 1:39:17.291
Stand aside for Captain Hook!

1:39:29.595 --> 1:39:31.013
All hail!

1:39:40.856 --> 1:39:44.318
My worst enemy!

1:39:50.115 --> 1:39:52.117
All hail Captain Hook!

1:39:52.159 --> 1:39:54.786
All hail Captain Hook!

1:39:55.996 --> 1:39:57.831
Throw him in the water!

1:40:01.585 --> 1:40:04.046
Grab his sword,
Captain Hook!

1:40:06.924 --> 1:40:09.343
Toss that dude in the water!

1:40:09.384 --> 1:40:11.220
Get him, Captain!

1:40:17.643 --> 1:40:19.645
Make him walk the plank!

1:40:22.022 --> 1:40:23.565
Take that,
Captain Hook.

1:41:16.118 --> 1:41:18.787
<i>Peter promised he would
visit as soon as he could.</i>

1:41:21.999 --> 1:41:24.459
<i>So we waited
and counted the days.</i>

1:41:33.343 --> 1:41:36.180
<i>Time went by
and moved faster and faster.</i>

1:41:44.605 --> 1:41:47.441
<i>We tried to remember
every adventure for him.</i>

1:41:52.863 --> 1:41:55.115
<i>But there were too many
to tell them all.</i>

1:42:03.332 --> 1:42:05.167
<i>There were miracles...</i>

1:42:06.001 --> 1:42:07.711
<i>and there were tragedies.</i>

1:42:10.005 --> 1:42:13.050
<i>And journeys
beyond our wildest dreams.</i>

1:42:20.140 --> 1:42:23.060
<i>We would travel
to many corners of the earth.</i>

1:42:26.063 --> 1:42:29.107
<i>And find that
there's magic everywhere.</i>

1:42:32.069 --> 1:42:34.321
<i>And not just
on Peter's island.</i>

1:42:38.534 --> 1:42:40.661
<i>As years went by...</i>

1:42:40.702 --> 1:42:43.747
<i>he became nothing more
than a bedtime story.</i>

1:42:50.462 --> 1:42:52.214
But sometimes,

1:42:52.256 --> 1:42:54.967
they could
still hear his voice.

1:42:55.008 --> 1:42:58.929
"Sneak away into the night."

1:43:19.283 --> 1:43:21.201
Is the volcano gonna be there?

1:43:22.578 --> 1:43:23.871
I should go.

1:43:24.913 --> 1:43:26.957
What about Uncle James?

1:43:27.666 --> 1:43:30.335
James Hook is why
we have no time to waste.

1:43:30.377 --> 1:43:32.963
Did you really
teach Mom how to fly?

1:43:33.005 --> 1:43:35.048
- No more questions.
- Okay, okay.

1:43:51.148 --> 1:43:53.358
Mom! Look who's here!

1:43:54.985 --> 1:43:57.279
Run, Mom, you can make it!

1:43:59.865 --> 1:44:00.908
Wait!

1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:05.120
She's never gonna make it!

1:44:06.622 --> 1:44:08.582
Wendy, you're too old!
