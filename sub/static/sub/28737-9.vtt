00:00.226 --> 00:02.872
The board's ordered me
to stop Liz's medication.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.755
How soon
will my symptoms return?

00:04.843 --> 00:06.544
A couple of days,
maybe a week.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.576
One day, I might need your help.
Yeah, to do what?

00:09.664 --> 00:12.068
I don't...
I don't wanna suffer.

00:12.156 --> 00:15.960
I might be getting me parole
real soon so, um, you know...

00:16.117 --> 00:18.177
Just giving your son
the VIP treatment.

00:18.265 --> 00:20.878
Why did you want to see me now,
after all this time?

00:20.984 --> 00:23.404
I was very selfish.
So selfish,

00:23.492 --> 00:25.975
I didn't know
what it meant to be a mum, Artie.

00:26.063 --> 00:27.641
I didn't...
I didn't know.

00:28.178 --> 00:32.148
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?
Get off me!

00:32.580 --> 00:36.708
It seems that nurse
was part of a planned attack on Winter.

00:36.796 --> 00:38.172
I reckon
there's something going on

00:38.260 --> 00:39.945
between her
and Mr. Jackson, too.

00:40.033 --> 00:41.052
How do you mean?

00:41.140 --> 00:43.529
He kept coming to see her in the slot,
in the middle of the night.

00:43.664 --> 00:46.904
Your plan failed, arsehole.
I'm still here.

00:46.992 --> 00:50.040
If you don't get me out of
here in the next 48 hours,

00:50.132 --> 00:51.708
the whole country's going
to find out

00:51.796 --> 00:53.476
how you like to spend
your holidays.

00:53.564 --> 00:55.662
- I need you to get out for a bit.
- Why? What are you doing?

00:55.750 --> 00:56.989
If you keep quiet,

00:57.077 --> 00:59.179
that 20K debt of yours,
gone,

00:59.311 --> 01:00.773
by the end of the day.

01:02.632 --> 01:06.226
Your lawyer.
He won't be much use to you, I'm afraid.

01:06.531 --> 01:09.505
He's not the only person
with a copy of those photos.

01:09.593 --> 01:11.740
- You're bluffing.
- Try me.

01:11.828 --> 01:14.313
Michael wasn't able to
pull the strings he'd hoped.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.562
So we're busting you
out of here instead.

03:54.688 --> 03:56.165
I don't fucking have it!

Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck!

04:07.275 --> 04:10.063
Oh, shit.
Fuck.

04:15.579 --> 04:18.399
Whatever's going on,
I know it's got something to do with Sean.

04:19.735 --> 04:22.086
What's he done?
You can tell me.

04:25.341 --> 04:26.653
Is it gear?

04:27.110 --> 04:28.186
What?

04:28.274 --> 04:30.336
Has he got you peddling
drugs around the prison?

04:31.867 --> 04:34.860
I'm not a bloody drug dealer, Jake,
for fuck's sake.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.740
It's his bookie.

04:39.688 --> 04:42.387
I owe him
and Sean a stack of dough.

04:43.455 --> 04:44.961
How much?

04:46.805 --> 04:48.977
- 20.
- Thousand?

04:49.656 --> 04:51.381
No, 20 bucks.

04:52.078 --> 04:54.274
Yes, $20,000.

04:55.102 --> 04:57.305
I made a deal with Sean
to wipe the debt.

04:57.393 --> 04:58.830
The prick's backed out.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.774
What kind of deal?

05:02.443 --> 05:04.281
I can't tell you.

05:06.104 --> 05:07.797
I'm fucked.

05:10.008 --> 05:12.883
I am so, so fucked.

05:14.646 --> 05:17.289
Hey, it's OK.

05:21.848 --> 05:23.462
It's all right.

05:23.647 --> 05:25.274
Oh, fuck.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.742
Come in.

05:37.519 --> 05:39.063
Hey.

05:46.609 --> 05:48.957
- What's this?
- Transfer papers.

05:49.414 --> 05:50.922
For Marie Winter.

05:53.740 --> 05:56.290
- I want you to sign them.
- Why would I do that?

05:57.480 --> 05:58.847
I know, Will.

05:59.389 --> 06:00.624
What do you know?

06:01.710 --> 06:04.117
That you have become
totally compromised.

06:06.656 --> 06:09.169
You want to talk about
professional conduct, Vera?

06:09.554 --> 06:10.906
Oh, don't you dare try
and make this

06:10.994 --> 06:12.889
- about Rita...
- Now, what I did is personal.

06:12.977 --> 06:15.037
- No.
- Any consequence is mine.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.794
- Will, wait... Don't.
- You taking Connors out of this prison...

06:16.882 --> 06:18.138
- jeopardised all of our careers...
- Will! At least

06:18.226 --> 06:20.242
I didn't bury
a fucking prisoner alive.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.251
Oh!

06:27.897 --> 06:29.124
- You OK?
- No, I'm fine.

06:29.212 --> 06:31.452
- Do you want me to get help?
- Don't change the subject.

06:33.788 --> 06:35.203
Just sign it.

06:40.924 --> 06:42.507
- Fuck!
- Yep.

06:44.194 --> 06:45.707
Yeah, no, I'm all set.

06:47.146 --> 06:48.426
Yeah, I know.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.035
I won't let you down.

06:53.752 --> 06:55.692
Hey, uh, I need a favour.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.281
You are shitting me.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.209
Tomorrow. I need you to roster
me on the Visitors' Entry.

07:00.297 --> 07:02.406
Tough. Roster's locked.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.522
So unlock it.

07:07.395 --> 07:08.897
Why?

07:09.578 --> 07:11.521
'Cause I want a cushy shift.

07:11.984 --> 07:15.531
- I want you to do what you promised.
- Hey, don't worry, I'm gonna sort it.

07:16.132 --> 07:18.312
- When?
- When you change the roster.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.745
- I could fuck you up, Sean.
- Oh, yeah,

07:20.833 --> 07:22.953
and fuck yourself up, too, Linda.

07:24.749 --> 07:27.243
Look, you do this

07:27.834 --> 07:29.355
and in just one day,

07:29.990 --> 07:31.429
it can all be over.

07:48.973 --> 07:51.047
We're on for tomorrow.

07:54.580 --> 07:56.281
Oh!

08:02.285 --> 08:03.735
Fuck!

08:06.117 --> 08:07.346
Hey.

08:07.749 --> 08:10.039
- Hey.
- I've just been in with my lawyer.

08:10.276 --> 08:11.991
Committal's set for tomorrow.

08:12.212 --> 08:13.724
True?

08:14.132 --> 08:17.007
- Yeah.
- Well, that's deadly, eh?

08:17.233 --> 08:18.662
Guess so.

08:34.006 --> 08:37.990
<i>Oh, she's probably making
a cup of tea. Yes, she is!</i>

08:38.195 --> 08:40.755
All right, Lizzie, it's time!

08:40.842 --> 08:42.888
- What?
- The mystery visit.

08:42.976 --> 08:45.763
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the mystery visit.

08:45.851 --> 08:48.404
- Yeah, don't tell me you forgot.
- No, no, course not.

08:48.492 --> 08:50.125
I-I just wish I...

08:50.213 --> 08:52.111
- knew,who I was I seeing.
- Nah!

08:52.199 --> 08:54.359
It's a big bucket-list
surprise, isn't it?

08:54.447 --> 08:56.703
Like I need
any more surprises.

08:57.047 --> 08:59.734
- Let's go, Liz.
- Is it Bea?

09:00.343 --> 09:01.820
Oh, good one!

09:02.257 --> 09:05.234
'Cause that'd be a bloody miracle
visit, wouldn't it, Mr Stewart?

09:05.359 --> 09:07.216
Hey? You see
what I done there?

09:07.304 --> 09:09.734
- Yeah.
- Go on!

09:15.878 --> 09:17.552
Just sit down here, Liz. 
I'll just be a sec.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.109
Thanks, Mr Stewart.

09:40.531 --> 09:42.023
Lizzie!

09:42.804 --> 09:44.995
- Surprise!
- Hey.

09:46.409 --> 09:49.721
Give your favourite
ex-jailbird a hug, eh?

09:51.413 --> 09:53.278
- You didn't know I was comin', did ya?
- Nuh.

09:53.366 --> 09:56.538
Booms said she was keeping it
under wraps, the cheeky minx.

09:57.692 --> 10:00.362
- So, how are ya?
- Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm good.

10:00.593 --> 10:02.953
- You look good.
- Yeah. How... how are you?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.434
Flat chat.

10:04.522 --> 10:08.516
- Need to come back in here for a holiday.
- Oh, right.

10:09.885 --> 10:11.855
I really missed ya.

10:13.163 --> 10:15.000
I... I missed you, too.

10:15.976 --> 10:17.276
And how are my girls?

10:17.592 --> 10:20.507
Oh, g... good.
Yeah, they're fine, fine.

10:20.998 --> 10:22.430
Good.

10:23.139 --> 10:26.072
- Ms Bennett's pregnant. Mmm.
- I heard.

10:26.304 --> 10:28.671
Who'd have thought
Miss. B'd have it in her, eh?

10:29.851 --> 10:31.655
I heard
you got a new Top Dog.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.749
She good to ya?

10:33.866 --> 10:36.382
- Don't have much to do with Marie.
- Mmm.

10:37.405 --> 10:38.608
Gidge sends her love.

10:38.702 --> 10:40.718
Think I preferred
the last one we had.

10:40.952 --> 10:42.140
Yeah.

10:42.343 --> 10:45.272
- Poor Kaz, eh?
- Do you know Kaz?

10:48.640 --> 10:51.132
Well, I heard she was
keeping an eye on you for me.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.619
Kaz is dead.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.520
Liz, are you OK?

10:58.608 --> 11:00.936
Yeah. I'm... I'm good.

11:01.046 --> 11:02.515
How are you?

11:06.111 --> 11:07.898
Do you know who I am?

11:16.771 --> 11:18.010
No.

11:18.098 --> 11:19.413
It's OK.

11:19.772 --> 11:21.880
- It's OK.
- I know I should know.

11:22.075 --> 11:24.981
- It's OK.
- No, it's not OK.

11:25.137 --> 11:26.917
It's not OK.

11:31.326 --> 11:32.902
It's fine, eh.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.392
It's not fine.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.184
No, it's not.

11:39.388 --> 11:40.737
I've gotta...

11:41.321 --> 11:43.155
I mean, I've gotta go.

11:44.779 --> 11:46.229
I need to go.

11:51.296 --> 11:52.829
Lizzie...

12:05.770 --> 12:06.875
Five minutes.

12:07.208 --> 12:11.661
- Hey!
- Hey. Oh.

12:15.051 --> 12:17.479
- You said she was doing good.
- Yeah.

12:17.567 --> 12:20.028
- She is.
- She didn't know who I was.

12:20.627 --> 12:22.997
- What?
- She had no idea.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.995
But I thought... I thought
she was... she was better,

12:28.083 --> 12:31.520
and I thought everything
was gonna be OK.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.848
Oh, shit,
I'm getting out of here soon.

12:34.012 --> 12:36.167
- Hey...
- I can't just leave her like this.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.026
You've just gotta focus
on your parole, hey?

12:38.114 --> 12:39.575
- No. She's...
- Focus on what's important.

12:39.663 --> 12:42.984
She's family, Franky. She's our
family, all right? She's... she's...

12:44.307 --> 12:46.108
Like, she's our mum.

12:46.778 --> 12:47.828
Yep.

12:48.237 --> 12:49.861
I can't just leave me mum.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.313
Sometimes you've got to.

12:52.512 --> 12:54.792
- Mm-mm.
- It's hard,

12:56.114 --> 12:58.083
but you gotta do
what's best for you.

12:59.295 --> 13:00.924
You deserve that.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.949
What about what... what
Lizzie deserves, but?

13:04.966 --> 13:06.584
You know, I'm...

13:07.433 --> 13:09.457
'Cos I'm all she's got.

13:10.727 --> 13:12.239
I'm it.

13:12.997 --> 13:14.420
Hey.

13:16.968 --> 13:19.251
You've got a shitload of love in ya.

13:20.526 --> 13:22.413
I want you to go out there

13:23.249 --> 13:25.173
and you give it
to Lizzie,

13:26.871 --> 13:28.584
while you can.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.958
- OK?
- While I can.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.536
Yeah.

13:34.637 --> 13:36.315
For both of us.

13:37.902 --> 13:39.846
Yeah, I'll do that.

13:41.101 --> 13:42.946
I'll do that.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.086
Come in.

14:01.873 --> 14:03.650
You asked to see me.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.106
Look,

14:08.197 --> 14:10.628
she helped me, all right?

14:12.737 --> 14:14.846
When things got bad with...

14:15.817 --> 14:18.973
- Ferguson, with everything.
- She helped you?

14:19.694 --> 14:21.270
How?

14:21.676 --> 14:23.167
She was the only one
who understood.

14:23.255 --> 14:25.361
- And what'd she understand?
- What I was going through.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.262
Oh, Will, she's a prisoner.

14:27.809 --> 14:29.481
- She took advantage of you.
- No.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.872
- She manipulated you.
- No, she didn't.

14:32.278 --> 14:35.067
Well, that is the only
thing that makes sense here.

14:38.173 --> 14:39.797
Oh, God.

14:41.719 --> 14:43.843
Don't tell me
you're in love with her.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.650
Tomorrow's my last day
before maternity leave.

14:52.871 --> 14:54.768
You have until then to sign it.

14:57.832 --> 14:59.325
What if I can't?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.385
Uh, what is it, Liz?
Are you sure it can't wait until tomorrow?

15:14.473 --> 15:16.856
No, I can't wait.
This has to be now.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.169
Yeah, OK, then.

15:21.358 --> 15:22.864
What's bothering you?

15:25.637 --> 15:28.459
A good friend
came to see me today,

15:29.248 --> 15:31.847
and, uh... oh, shit...

15:32.528 --> 15:34.040
I didn't know who she was.

15:34.943 --> 15:36.785
I couldn't remember her.

15:38.356 --> 15:39.764
Right.

15:40.911 --> 15:43.051
Well look, it's possible
that you're building up

15:43.192 --> 15:44.659
a resistance to the Psuldrycin.

15:44.747 --> 15:47.854
Which is why I need to go back
on the original dose, not half.

15:47.942 --> 15:49.510
Liz, that dosage might have caused

15:49.598 --> 15:50.831
- your psychotic reaction...
- Might have,

15:50.919 --> 15:53.581
- but you don't know that for certain.
- I don't know anything for certain

15:53.669 --> 15:55.723
when it comes to this
drug and your condition.

15:55.981 --> 15:58.411
- That's why I need to monitor every...
- I can't

15:58.669 --> 16:00.895
be like that
in front of Artie.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.113
I can't.

16:04.848 --> 16:06.294
He's my son.

16:06.457 --> 16:09.059
I have to tell him
about the dementia.

16:09.624 --> 16:11.329
That I am dying.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.848
I owe him the truth, and
I need to be clear-headed.

16:15.951 --> 16:20.754
I need
to go back on the full dose.

16:20.923 --> 16:22.579
Please.

16:23.184 --> 16:24.440
Please.

16:34.866 --> 16:36.785
You haven't told anyone

16:37.278 --> 16:40.746
- that you're still on it?
- No. No-one.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.361
Thought you were better.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.817
Oh, so... so did I, love.

17:15.494 --> 17:17.249
I knew her face.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.400
- It's Franky.
- Yeah.

17:19.488 --> 17:22.503
- I just... I couldn't place her.
- Mmm.

17:22.785 --> 17:24.973
I was thinking, it... it could...

17:25.778 --> 17:27.856
It could just be a one-off, eh?

17:30.043 --> 17:32.572
Love, do you... do you
remember what I asked you?

17:32.660 --> 17:35.668
- What I might need you to do for me?
- Nuh.

17:36.426 --> 17:38.744
Hey, when things
get so bad

17:38.832 --> 17:41.011
- that I-I can't...
- No. No,

17:41.238 --> 17:43.158
we're not gonna
talk about this now.

17:43.246 --> 17:44.433
Hey, Jesus.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.275
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna get the cards

17:46.363 --> 17:48.684
and we're gonna play
Strip Jack Naked. Yeah.

17:50.371 --> 17:52.525
I've been on me
feet all day, Suze.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.626
Would you mind giving your mum

17:53.714 --> 17:54.919
a little foot rub here, eh?
Babes?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.744
Just get your pissy
fuckin' breath away from me!

17:56.832 --> 18:00.121
God, this stuff's rough
on ya guts, eh? Oh!

18:01.331 --> 18:03.150
No, no, no, this is my cell.

18:03.238 --> 18:04.876
Oh, my god!

18:04.964 --> 18:08.109
- Boomer!
- Oh, fuck's sake!

18:09.040 --> 18:10.629
I'm sorry.

18:10.824 --> 18:13.047
Fuckin' why'd ya have to...

18:13.157 --> 18:15.593
<i>- Go away! I don't want your help!</i>
- Oh.

18:15.781 --> 18:17.481
<i>Move your hair!</i>

18:18.308 --> 18:20.793
<i>You don't want that shit
danglin' in your face!</i>

18:20.881 --> 18:22.017
<i>Go away!</i>

18:22.105 --> 18:24.068
<i>Leave me alone. Go away.
I don't want your help.</i>

18:24.155 --> 18:26.683
<i>No, I'm not gettin' away from ya.
I don't wanna fuckin' help ya, do I?</i>

18:26.770 --> 18:28.680
<i>Get off me. Leave me alone.</i>

18:33.221 --> 18:35.083
<i>Go away!</i>

18:47.486 --> 18:49.183
So, the doctor said that

18:49.465 --> 18:51.642
I might have
some temporary issues.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.962
- Mobility and strength.
- Yeah, 'course.

18:56.376 --> 18:57.986
My coordination...

18:59.711 --> 19:01.610
might be a little wonky
for a while.

19:01.915 --> 19:03.361
You'll be right.

19:07.623 --> 19:09.878
I'll never be able
to box again.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.324
Course you will.

19:13.545 --> 19:15.142
I'm too weak.

19:15.548 --> 19:17.361
I'll make you strong again.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.531
I'm scared, Reets.

19:24.652 --> 19:26.840
You don't need
to be scared of anything

19:27.197 --> 19:28.595
or anybody.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.125
<i>Attention compound, attention compound.</i>

19:51.213 --> 19:54.181
<i>All women to report to
assigned work duties.</i>

20:04.377 --> 20:05.798
Oh, Ms Bennett.

20:07.079 --> 20:10.095
- I'm going to be late for work unit.
- No, I'll write you a note.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.039
You know,
when you first arrived here,

20:16.782 --> 20:18.337
I felt sorry for you.

20:18.462 --> 20:20.806
I thought
here was a woman, a mother,

20:21.103 --> 20:23.931
who has suffered the
worst thing imaginable.

20:24.759 --> 20:27.181
And I tried to put myself
in your shoes.

20:29.415 --> 20:32.915
- But we are such different people.
- Well, not so different.

20:35.493 --> 20:40.040
The grief, the loss, the
injustice you must have felt.

20:41.931 --> 20:44.100
Where does someone
like you

20:45.025 --> 20:47.423
direct a rage like that?

20:52.173 --> 20:55.517
I will not
let you destroy him.

20:57.681 --> 21:01.642
Now, if I told you that I loved Will,
would you believe me?

21:02.860 --> 21:05.508
Well, maybe that's the
difference between us.

21:06.017 --> 21:07.780
I've known real love.

21:09.322 --> 21:11.093
Ahh, sorry, Ms Bennett.

21:11.181 --> 21:13.993
I'm here for Winter.
She has a visitor.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.913
Whatever we had,

21:23.923 --> 21:25.144
it's over.

21:29.095 --> 21:32.400
Your committal hearing's at 3:30.
The brawler's on its way.

21:32.698 --> 21:34.248
Just sit tight.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.821
- We'll have you out within the hour.
- How?

21:50.909 --> 21:53.141
Brawler meant for Connors,
then a private jet.

21:53.391 --> 21:55.850
But it is not taking off
until we are satisfied

21:55.938 --> 21:57.884
you have erased that file.

21:59.002 --> 22:01.046
Daddy would be proud.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.618
Oh, Artie.

22:19.993 --> 22:21.189
How're you doin'?

22:21.322 --> 22:23.071
Ahh, yeah.

22:24.178 --> 22:26.532
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm OK.

22:27.618 --> 22:29.452
I was talking to Maddy about you.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.046
- Maddy.
- My girlfriend.

22:31.134 --> 22:32.358
I told you about her.

22:32.446 --> 22:34.735
- Mmm.
- I'm thinking I'll bring her in next week.

22:35.656 --> 22:39.006
It won't freak her out.
No, no, Maddy's cool like that.

22:39.094 --> 22:41.594
Um, but she wants to meet you.

22:43.142 --> 22:44.550
Artie,

22:44.977 --> 22:46.828
I'm so grateful

22:47.062 --> 22:50.266
to you for coming in to
see me, after everything.

22:51.656 --> 22:56.406
But there's something I have to
tell you, and it's not gonna be easy.

22:57.094 --> 22:59.633
OK. Um, what?

23:02.799 --> 23:05.164
I've got dementia, love.

23:07.399 --> 23:09.275
And it's the disease
of the brain where...

23:09.363 --> 23:12.289
Yeah, I...
I know what dementia is, Mum.

23:12.531 --> 23:15.076
Yeah, well, it's bad,

23:15.172 --> 23:18.336
and it's moving
pretty fast.

23:19.413 --> 23:21.413
And one day soon,
I'm...

23:23.430 --> 23:25.711
I'm not gonna know
who you are.

23:26.015 --> 23:29.859
So I want you to remember me like
I am now,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.445
not dribbling and, um,

23:33.125 --> 23:34.742
forgetting everything.

23:35.469 --> 23:37.203
What are... what are you saying?

23:38.930 --> 23:41.453
I'm asking you
not to visit me again.

23:43.274 --> 23:45.318
But you... you... you
wanted me to come back.

23:45.406 --> 23:47.576
I know, love, I... Yeah, I did.

23:47.664 --> 23:49.771
'Cause I needed to see if
you've turned out all right,

23:49.859 --> 23:52.975
and you have,
my beautiful boy.

23:53.063 --> 23:54.320
Oh, you're not a boy.

23:54.408 --> 23:56.516
You're a fine young man.
I mean, look at you.

23:56.727 --> 24:00.594
Handsome and smart,
and you're considerate.

24:00.930 --> 24:02.315
You're kind.

24:03.031 --> 24:05.161
And I could not be
more proud of you.

24:05.776 --> 24:07.544
But, Artie,

24:07.865 --> 24:12.053
love, you need
to get on with your life.

24:13.333 --> 24:16.505
- Mum. Mum, you...
- Listen, listen.

24:16.630 --> 24:20.505
I'm gonna get up from the
table, I'm going to hug you,

24:20.943 --> 24:23.179
I'm gonna walk out that door,

24:24.614 --> 24:26.914
and I don't want you coming back.

24:28.794 --> 24:30.500
Please, Artie.

24:35.062 --> 24:36.646
Come on.

24:42.372 --> 24:43.972
My boy.

24:45.153 --> 24:46.787
My boy.

24:48.052 --> 24:49.585
I love you,

24:50.224 --> 24:52.497
and I want you
to be proud of yourself.

24:53.036 --> 24:54.635
Always.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.800
You hear me?

24:58.404 --> 25:00.100
Good boy.

25:11.620 --> 25:13.447
It's OK, love.

25:17.967 --> 25:19.672
Come on, love.

25:20.406 --> 25:21.904
Come on.

25:53.735 --> 25:55.778
Come through.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.357
Ta.

26:03.342 --> 26:04.942
What do you want?

26:05.757 --> 26:07.514
I know what's going on.

26:09.224 --> 26:11.693
- Linda told me.
- Oh, yeah?

26:12.004 --> 26:15.310
- And what'd she tell you?
- About the money she owes.

26:16.638 --> 26:18.404
Well, it's not my
fault she loves a punt.

26:18.516 --> 26:20.019
Well, she can't pay it.

26:22.732 --> 26:25.146
Yeah, well, can we do this later,
Jake? 'Cause I'm on the clock here.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.972
So I'll pay the fuckin' debt.

26:27.060 --> 26:28.823
Since when
did you grow a heart?

26:28.911 --> 26:31.207
I just hate you that much.

26:33.099 --> 26:34.317
Hmm.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.599
Fine. You be a hero.

27:08.885 --> 27:10.329
Just wait here.

27:10.735 --> 27:12.131
You ready?

27:15.317 --> 27:17.050
You fellas my ride?

27:19.348 --> 27:20.661
You know the protocol.

27:20.755 --> 27:23.122
These come off the second
I'm in that brawler.

27:36.003 --> 27:37.255
I fuckin' knew it!

27:37.427 --> 27:39.625
- Piss off!
- What's going on, Jenkins?

27:40.982 --> 27:43.978
- I just need a hair of the dog, Suze.
- Jenkins.

27:45.554 --> 27:46.988
Please.

27:48.450 --> 27:51.606
Nothin'.
Nothin', Ms. Miles. It's all good.

27:56.583 --> 27:59.089
Hey. You're not up for this.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.075
- No, I'm OK.
- No, it's too soon. Ms Miles?

28:02.411 --> 28:04.013
Ruby's not feeling crash-hot.

28:04.115 --> 28:06.511
- Tell someone who cares, Novak.
- Hey, it's her first work unit

28:06.599 --> 28:08.747
since she got back from
hospital. Have a heart.

28:09.473 --> 28:10.654
Peta, take her to Medical.

28:10.742 --> 28:12.333
- Get her checked out.
- All right, come on.

28:16.608 --> 28:19.177
Right, let's do this.

28:19.427 --> 28:20.591
We're out of here.

28:21.209 --> 28:24.810
Hey, Mitchell's not feeling well.
Just gonna take her to main Medical.

28:27.630 --> 28:29.206
Unlock the cuffs.

28:29.302 --> 28:30.441
- What?
- There's something I need to do

28:30.529 --> 28:32.589
back in General.
I just need five minutes.

28:32.677 --> 28:34.386
- Are you serious?
- Unlock the cuffs.

28:34.474 --> 28:36.105
- No, I'm...
- Unlock the fuckin' cuffs now.

28:36.230 --> 28:40.105
- Hey, Mr Brody! Where's my transport?
- Yeah, it's coming, Connors.

28:40.193 --> 28:41.386
Both of you.
Wait in there.

28:41.474 --> 28:44.154
- You're fuckin' kidding me.
- Wait in there.

28:48.911 --> 28:50.794
I don't fuckin' believe this.

28:51.176 --> 28:54.575
We are supposed to be in
that fuckin' brawler already.

28:54.764 --> 28:56.508
Oh, shit.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.838
Let's go. Let's go.

29:02.583 --> 29:04.186
Just hold up, yeah?

29:04.371 --> 29:06.100
What's Winter doing here?

29:06.828 --> 29:08.598
Oh, she just had a strip search.

29:09.598 --> 29:10.977
Birdsworth just had a visitor.

29:13.074 --> 29:14.450
Who's he?

29:15.845 --> 29:18.032
He's here to take
Connors to her committal.

29:19.658 --> 29:20.913
Right, well, you're running a bit late.

29:21.001 --> 29:23.316
- She's meant to have left 15 minutes ago.
- Yeah.

29:25.572 --> 29:27.681
Well, I don't recognise either of you.

29:28.329 --> 29:30.533
Oh, well, the agency sent them.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.087
Where are your IDs?

29:36.809 --> 29:38.491
Show me your IDs.

29:40.042 --> 29:42.773
- Wes, you've got 'em...
- Sorry, we just forgot to put 'em on.

29:42.923 --> 29:45.001
They're just in the bag here.

30:01.298 --> 30:04.603
Marie, what the fuck is going on?

30:17.361 --> 30:20.438
What are you waiting for, Birdsworth?
Clothes won't strip themselves.

30:26.488 --> 30:28.496
Hey, we need to go now.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.186
What do you want to do with her?

30:31.519 --> 30:34.348
Brody,
why don't you end this now?

30:34.559 --> 30:35.658
Whatever is going on,

30:35.746 --> 30:37.611
- it is not worth a stretch at Walford.
- Shut up.

30:37.699 --> 30:40.080
As a prison officer,
how long do you think you'll last?

30:40.168 --> 30:41.934
- I said shut up.
- You seen a lynching? I have.

30:42.022 --> 30:43.710
Tape up her mouth too.

30:50.023 --> 30:52.168
What are you waiting
for? I told you to strip.

30:53.012 --> 30:55.823
You're going to the
Psych Unit, Birdsworth.

30:56.325 --> 30:58.191
No. No.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.721
I'm not goin' to the fuckin' Psych Unit.

31:00.809 --> 31:03.980
Fuckin'... I don't need
the fuckin' Psych Unit!

31:04.067 --> 31:05.613
- Come here!
- Get off! Get off me!

31:05.700 --> 31:07.216
- Calm down!
- Get off me!

31:07.303 --> 31:09.469
- Calm down!
- Hey! Shut her up.

31:13.446 --> 31:15.657
Call in a lockdown! Call in a lockdown!

31:15.781 --> 31:17.890
- Fuckin' get her in there!
- This is Sierra 7.

31:18.064 --> 31:19.665
We need a lockdown in
the Admissions Corridor!

31:19.752 --> 31:22.725
I repeat, we need a lockdown
in the Admissions Corridor...

31:23.184 --> 31:25.767
Where's Anton? We're going now!

31:27.958 --> 31:29.455
What have you done?

31:29.736 --> 31:31.014
Why isn't it opening, Sean?

31:31.124 --> 31:33.270
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Oh, my god!

31:34.770 --> 31:38.331
Sierra 3 to Sierra 4. What's going
on in the Admissions Corridor?

31:38.606 --> 31:40.895
Uh, a... a prisoner, Birdsworth,

31:41.004 --> 31:43.713
went crazy in the strip search
room. Attacked an officer.

31:43.801 --> 31:45.567
- I was...
- Hey! Can you shut the fuck up?

31:45.655 --> 31:47.917
Look, it's all under
control now. I just...

31:48.005 --> 31:49.147
I need the lockdown released

31:49.234 --> 31:51.501
so I can get the officer
into Medical, over.

31:53.477 --> 31:54.909
What's Winter doing down there?

31:54.996 --> 31:56.617
We have a medical
emergency here, Governor.

31:56.704 --> 31:58.380
I need you to open the airlock.

32:02.437 --> 32:04.613
- Get off me!
- Ms Bennett!

32:05.893 --> 32:09.129
Officer Brody,
put Ms Bennett on the radio.

32:09.632 --> 32:11.039
Uh...

32:11.864 --> 32:14.561
Officer Brody, I asked
you to put Ms Bennett on.

32:14.649 --> 32:16.183
That's an order.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.795
Put her on now!

32:23.529 --> 32:25.348
Fuck.

32:26.867 --> 32:29.555
Attention compound. We are in lockdown.

32:30.423 --> 32:32.629
Repeat, this is a lockdown.

32:36.610 --> 32:38.627
Hey, what's going on?

32:38.715 --> 32:40.939
It's fine. Just go and sit back down.

32:41.075 --> 32:43.887
Sierra 5 to Sierra 9, over.

32:45.924 --> 32:47.416
Hey, why are we in lockdown?

32:47.504 --> 32:50.692
There's something going on with
Brody in the Admissions Corridor.

32:51.418 --> 32:55.506
If there are any officers near the
Admissions Corridor, I want eyes on.

32:56.715 --> 32:58.231
There's an officer hurt.

32:58.442 --> 33:00.268
- Vera's down there.
- What?

33:00.356 --> 33:03.439
Along with Winter and
Birdsworth. I don't know who else.

33:05.262 --> 33:06.778
What the hell is he doing?

33:06.950 --> 33:09.393
- What have you done?
- Put her back in the strip search room

33:09.480 --> 33:11.465
- and shut her the fuck up.
- Shut your mouth.

33:11.552 --> 33:13.683
- Get in there... Get in there!
- No, no, no, no... No! No!

33:13.770 --> 33:16.944
- Don't move!
- Drag her in there. Cuff her to the table.

33:19.742 --> 33:22.111
Shit! Now, we have gotta leave.

33:22.199 --> 33:23.283
- Now.
- Oh, yeah?

33:23.371 --> 33:26.863
What do you think I'm trying
to do? Five fuckin' minutes.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.097
It might have something
to do with Linda.

33:33.237 --> 33:35.879
Sean's got his hooks
into her for 20 grand.

33:38.238 --> 33:40.722
What's going on, Officer Brody?

33:41.043 --> 33:43.649
I need you to open the airlock, Will.

33:43.863 --> 33:45.519
Not till you tell me
what this is about.

33:45.613 --> 33:48.273
Right, right now it's
about you openin' this door.

33:48.721 --> 33:51.132
Who are the other officers with you?

33:55.609 --> 33:57.783
- Open the fuckin' airlock, Will.
- Shit.

33:57.871 --> 33:59.223
Open it. Vera's in there.

33:59.311 --> 34:00.447
Sean, OK.

34:00.535 --> 34:01.751
Look, I'll release the airlock,

34:01.839 --> 34:03.783
but only for you and
the other two officers.

34:03.871 --> 34:07.129
- You leave Vera and Winter behind.
- Nah, can't do that, Gov.

34:07.293 --> 34:09.547
They're both coming
with me now. Insurance.

34:09.636 --> 34:11.679
- Fucking prick. Give me the radio.
- Look, Brody,

34:11.793 --> 34:13.969
you won't get far.
I'm informing the police.

34:14.058 --> 34:17.491
Yeah? You bring the cops into
this, you bring 'em into this,

34:18.159 --> 34:19.715
I shoot Vera.

34:20.277 --> 34:22.581
Now open the airlock.

34:23.532 --> 34:24.962
Fuck.

34:26.842 --> 34:27.904
Get in there!

34:27.991 --> 34:29.222
- Just let 'em go.
- OK.

34:29.309 --> 34:30.829
- Give them Winter.
- Yes, Governor?

34:30.916 --> 34:33.746
Call the police. Tell them
we've got a Code Red in progress.

34:33.833 --> 34:37.543
What are you doing? You heard
him. He's gonna shoot Vera.

34:38.027 --> 34:39.915
What the hell are
they trying to do?

34:40.853 --> 34:42.824
Work unit. Is that still on?

34:49.112 --> 34:51.322
Oh, thank fuckin' Christ for that!

34:51.409 --> 34:53.420
Thank you.

34:54.478 --> 34:55.509
Laundry.

34:55.746 --> 34:57.910
- Linda, it's Will.
- What was with the alarm?

34:58.019 --> 35:01.537
We're in lockdown. Brody's taken
control of the Admissions Corridor.

35:01.662 --> 35:03.306
- He's what?
- Listen,

35:03.393 --> 35:05.269
do you have any idea
what this is about?

35:05.588 --> 35:07.369
Me? No, why?

35:07.582 --> 35:09.191
But you owe him money.

35:11.582 --> 35:13.185
It's not that.

35:13.928 --> 35:16.157
It could have something
to do with Winter.

35:17.517 --> 35:19.925
- What?
- Sean and Winter have something going on.

35:20.013 --> 35:21.394
That's all I know.

35:22.675 --> 35:25.009
- He's armed with a gun.
- You're fucking kidding me.

35:25.097 --> 35:27.666
Right now, they're holed
up in Small Medical.

35:27.754 --> 35:29.916
He's got two guys
dressed as officers.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.894
I don't think he knows
you guys are in there.

35:32.129 --> 35:35.334
Listen, do you think you can get
the women through the east airlock?

35:37.649 --> 35:39.310
I don't know.

35:39.535 --> 35:42.289
- We can try.
- OK. I'll distract him

35:42.376 --> 35:44.441
and when you're all at the
airlock, I'll release it.

35:44.571 --> 35:45.863
OK.

35:50.917 --> 35:53.300
I'm running out of patience here.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.816
If you hurt Vera, I
will fucking kill you.

35:56.941 --> 35:58.285
Oh, Jakey!

35:58.480 --> 36:01.322
Hey, if you want to see
her or your baby alive,

36:01.410 --> 36:03.004
you get the boss to release this door.

36:03.113 --> 36:05.121
- You're a dead man, Brody.
- Yeah.

36:05.254 --> 36:08.384
- I'm going down there.
- Like hell you are. You stay put.

36:08.472 --> 36:10.785
Last thing we need is another hostage.

36:11.650 --> 36:12.860
What's happening?

36:13.010 --> 36:14.941
- What?
- Shut up and listen.

36:15.222 --> 36:17.266
You go one by one to the airlock.

36:17.354 --> 36:19.548
When we're all there, the
Governor will unlock it.

36:24.941 --> 36:26.666
Stop fucking with me, Will.

36:26.754 --> 36:29.483
I'm not, Sean. I'm just trying to
figure out why this is happening.

36:29.570 --> 36:32.367
Yeah? Well, you figure
it out when we're gone.

36:32.455 --> 36:34.064
You know I can't let
you take anyone with you.

36:34.152 --> 36:35.117
Hey! Hey! Hey!

36:35.205 --> 36:36.671
I'm the one with the gun here.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.285
And I'm gonna fuckin' use it.

36:38.524 --> 36:41.867
Now, you don't want anyone's
blood on your hands, do you?

36:41.955 --> 36:43.368
Well, do ya?

36:44.617 --> 36:46.460
- No, no.
- No.

36:46.548 --> 36:50.143
- So you open this door, or someone's gonna die.
- Shit.

36:51.386 --> 36:52.973
Hey!

36:55.830 --> 36:58.433
- Get in the fuckin' laundry. Get in there.
- Move!

36:58.521 --> 37:02.173
- Get in there! Get up, get in there.
- Move!

37:02.916 --> 37:04.232
Shit!

37:06.210 --> 37:07.681
Stay where you are!

37:07.930 --> 37:09.573
Oh, Jesus Christ!

37:09.768 --> 37:12.027
- What are you doing, Sean?
- Shut up, you whiny bitch.

37:12.387 --> 37:14.659
Give me that belt. Hurry up!

37:15.475 --> 37:17.162
Cover the cameras.

37:17.385 --> 37:19.370
Do it. Do it!

37:21.287 --> 37:22.977
Fuckin' hell.

37:38.101 --> 37:40.025
She needs a doctor.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.780
This has turned to shit.

37:56.994 --> 37:58.571
This is Rita Connors.

37:59.025 --> 38:01.245
I'm in the Admissions Holding Cell.

38:01.689 --> 38:03.235
Is anyone hearing this?

38:03.525 --> 38:06.353
Hello? Is there anyone there?

38:06.580 --> 38:09.492
I want everyone together
over here. Let's go.

38:09.580 --> 38:11.476
Let's fucking go!

38:11.564 --> 38:14.039
Get on the floor. You, too, Smiles.

38:14.127 --> 38:16.578
Officer Brody, holding up a
prison. Really fuckin' smart.

38:16.665 --> 38:19.055
- Shut up!
- If that bitch gets mouthy again,

38:19.142 --> 38:20.858
shoot her in the face.

38:43.710 --> 38:45.149
Fuck!

38:46.536 --> 38:48.334
How close are the police?

38:48.422 --> 38:51.024
Ten minutes. The SOG's been notified.

38:51.485 --> 38:54.780
- If he hurts Vera because of the cops...
- Will, are you there?

39:00.311 --> 39:02.282
Yeah, I'm here.

39:05.115 --> 39:06.524
Are you all right?

39:07.144 --> 39:08.683
Is Vera OK?

39:10.790 --> 39:13.696
Yeah, but we don't really
know what's going on.

39:16.500 --> 39:19.208
I'm scared, Will.
He's... he's got a gun on me.

39:20.864 --> 39:23.430
We need you to open the airlock.

39:26.094 --> 39:28.040
I can't let him take you and Vera.

39:28.128 --> 39:30.413
Will, I'll go with them
as a hostage.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.913
And I'll take care of
Ms Bennett, I promise.

39:33.650 --> 39:35.516
I can't take that chance.

39:35.649 --> 39:38.157
Please, Will, he's gonna
start hurting the women.

39:41.633 --> 39:45.305
You gotta convince Sean to
just take Winter. Let Vera go.

39:46.110 --> 39:49.305
Right, you heard her, Gov. Now,
are you gonna open this door?

39:59.854 --> 40:02.641
- Can't do that, Sean.
- Fuck!

40:04.763 --> 40:06.813
Get her in the laundry.

40:24.885 --> 40:26.433
This is Rita Connors.

40:26.583 --> 40:28.911
I'm in the Admissions Holding Cell.

40:29.506 --> 40:31.569
Please, someone, come in.

40:40.183 --> 40:41.572
Holy shit.

40:41.888 --> 40:43.469
- What are you doing there?
- Sit down.

40:43.556 --> 40:46.459
- Oh, shit!
- Bloody hell!

40:47.068 --> 40:50.357
- Yep, is everyone here OK?
- Ms Bennett, what's going on?

40:50.920 --> 40:54.535
Winter is trying to escape.
Officer Brody is working for her.

40:54.623 --> 40:57.373
- No fuckin' way!
- I never liked that bitch.

40:58.084 --> 40:59.402
What the fuck!

40:59.490 --> 41:01.714
- Marie, what the fuck are you doing?
- Shut her up!

41:01.802 --> 41:03.549
Don't you touch her!

41:03.701 --> 41:06.810
I'm gonna do more than touch her
if we don't get out of here, Marie.

41:07.521 --> 41:09.414
I'll shoot her in the fuckin' head.

41:15.295 --> 41:17.050
Is there anybody there?

41:17.307 --> 41:18.965
For God's sakes!

41:19.171 --> 41:22.062
It's Rita Connors. I'm in
the Admissions Holding Cell.

41:22.263 --> 41:24.790
Somebody answer this bloody intercom!

41:25.428 --> 41:26.672
Who's this?

41:26.810 --> 41:29.196
Hello?

41:29.709 --> 41:31.037
Jackson.

41:32.545 --> 41:35.318
Who? Yeah, yeah, patch her through.

41:35.481 --> 41:37.105
Connors, where are ya?

41:37.193 --> 41:39.527
I'm stuck in the bloody holding
cell while all shit's goin' down.

41:39.615 --> 41:41.832
We're in lockdown.
You'll just have to sit it out.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.480
Listen, I don't know what's goin' on,

41:43.576 --> 41:45.920
but Marie Winter is running things.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.769
What? What... what are you saying?

41:49.037 --> 41:51.669
Whatever it is with Officer
Brody and those other two fellas,

41:51.927 --> 41:53.730
Marie's behind it.

41:56.491 --> 41:58.033
What is it?

42:03.200 --> 42:05.037
Brody, put Winter on.

42:06.248 --> 42:07.252
Why?

42:07.449 --> 42:10.043
- I said, put Winter on.
- Come on.

42:19.667 --> 42:20.968
Will?

42:21.770 --> 42:23.387
What's going on?

42:24.521 --> 42:26.101
It's Officer Brody. He's gone...

42:26.189 --> 42:28.320
gone crazy or something.

42:31.979 --> 42:33.605
Are you behind this?

42:34.982 --> 42:38.006
What? I don't... What
are you talking about?

42:38.209 --> 42:39.890
Are you trying to escape?

42:43.274 --> 42:45.224
Just tell me the truth, Marie.

42:45.998 --> 42:49.360
Whatever's going on between you
and Brody, are you behind it?

43:05.787 --> 43:08.181
Just open the gate, Will.

43:15.185 --> 43:16.782
Time is up, Governor.

43:16.907 --> 43:19.927
You release the fuckin' lockdown now!

43:24.468 --> 43:25.577
OK.

43:26.258 --> 43:27.282
No!

43:27.377 --> 43:29.568
No, no, please!

43:30.187 --> 43:32.082
Oh, god! No!

43:47.593 --> 43:50.422
Release the lockdown,
or I shoot Vera.

43:50.578 --> 43:51.913
It's over, Sean.

43:52.242 --> 43:54.242
Open the doors, Will.

43:55.906 --> 43:58.209
- There's no way out of this.
- Open the doors!

43:58.297 --> 44:00.623
Just drop the gun and end
this before someone gets hurt.

44:00.711 --> 44:02.474
Open the fuckin' airlock!

44:02.562 --> 44:05.108
Don't make this worse
for yourself, Sean.

44:05.739 --> 44:07.171
Sean?

44:09.330 --> 44:10.686
Sean?

44:12.037 --> 44:13.631
Open the doors.
