Welcome to Deep Regrets.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.800
See anything you like?

00:22.720 --> 00:24.198
Heather?

00:24.200 --> 00:27.918
Can I interest you in one of
our signature ruby red bracelets

00:27.920 --> 00:29.720
or... two?

00:31.200 --> 00:33.358
As we say here at Deep Regrets,

00:33.360 --> 00:35.438
life is fleeting.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.678
Rubies are forever.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.278
I don't think those
are in my price range.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.718
Our bracelets
don't cost a thing, Veronica.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.398
All you have to do

00:46.400 --> 00:49.398
is take the first step.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.480
I did, and I've never felt better.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.318
They make us say that.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.358
Actually, Veronica, I thought working
here would be wonderful, but honestly,

00:59.360 --> 01:01.838
it's so boring.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.238
At least it's not the other place.

01:04.239 --> 01:07.680
But I just wish there were a few more
young people that worked here.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.478
Do you think you and your new boyfriend
could help me with that, Veronica?

01:13.480 --> 01:15.038
Send me someone to play with.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.638
Oh, Heather, I would never--

01:17.640 --> 01:19.598
That was an accident. That was--

01:19.600 --> 01:21.958
It was just a misunderstanding
between me and JD, I--

01:21.960 --> 01:23.798
Where is JD, anyway?

01:23.800 --> 01:27.638
Weird that he's not at my funeral,
considering I was your best friend.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.598
You'd think he'd be there for you.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.758
-I... I don't know.
-It's okay.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.718
I'm sure he had better things
to do besides be a good boyfriend.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.518
Well, thank you so much
for shopping at Deep Regrets.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.238
And do be a dear and think
about sending me someone to play with.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.720
At this point, could be anyone.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.800
Even you.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.880
Let's go, Veronica.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.400
You owe me.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.120
Father, blessed be the fruit.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.718
You obviously already know this, but...

02:56.720 --> 02:59.638
my name is Heather Chandler.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.200
And I know what you're thinking.

03:02.520 --> 03:06.278
Why would Heather try to kill herself

03:06.280 --> 03:08.520
when I already
blazed that trail days ago?

03:09.760 --> 03:11.238
We'll never know.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.238
-She's gone, sure.
-You are fabulous.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.558
But I'm here

03:16.560 --> 03:18.718
as a reminder of the toll

03:18.720 --> 03:20.918
suicide can take on us.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.438
So please,

03:22.440 --> 03:26.558
let me be the vessel
of all of your thoughts

03:26.560 --> 03:28.640
and all of your prayers.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.600
Thank you.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.518
That was so good.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.678
Our daughter was straight.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.440
And we love her.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.960
We love our dead, straight daughter.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.358
God, all this death
is making me so grief jerky.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.680
Hold this.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.678
Why is Kurt texting you about blow jobs?

04:11.680 --> 04:14.558
Veronica, you have to promise me
you'll never speak of this to anyone.

04:14.560 --> 04:18.598
-Why? Everybody knows Kurt's gay.
-I know, Veronica. It's not 2004.

04:18.600 --> 04:23.798
But what no one does know is
that I am hooking up with a boring jock.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.718
Heather Chandler will ruin me

04:25.720 --> 04:28.518
if she finds out I'm sleeping
with a sentient woven belt.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.478
You can't live
in fear of Heather, Heather.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.038
You're so pretty and so dumb.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.718
Speaking of, you should
double with Kurt and I.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.158
Ram is always such a third wheel
and you both love appetizers.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.158
No, I don't know. I mean,
I have this thing going with JD, so...

04:43.160 --> 04:46.238
Really, Veronica?
If the Unabomber likes you so much,

04:46.240 --> 04:48.800
how come he didn't come
to Heather M's funeral?

05:08.120 --> 05:10.158
You used to climb through my window.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.438
Now you just send me
a text that says, "Here."

05:12.440 --> 05:14.358
How Mr. Darcy of you.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.718
Babe. Get in.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.318
Actually, I think I'm just
gonna stay in tonight, JD.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.518
Rough day and all...

05:22.520 --> 05:24.280
with my best friend's funeral.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.358
The one you didn't show up for.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.518
And sit through another episode
of Westerburg's hit new show

05:30.520 --> 05:34.400
"Grief: Who Wore It Best?"
No, thank you.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.240
JD...

05:40.880 --> 05:42.440
Heather was my best friend.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.280
Veronica.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.480
That funeral had nothing
to do with Heather McNamara.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.358
If you want to honor her, honor her.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.520
But don't pretend her funeral
had anything to do with her.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.640
Everyone in that room killed Heather.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.918
And then, with her body still warm
they all crowd around, jerk off

06:04.920 --> 06:06.478
and pretend to be shocked

06:06.480 --> 06:09.160
that the pretty young girl
they all ignored slit her wrists.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.478
Heather's funeral
was just the dirty tissue?

06:12.480 --> 06:16.200
in our town's inevitable exercise
in masturbatory absolution.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.960
Night.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.638
<i>Well, we need to do something.</i>

06:40.640 --> 06:43.278
I mean, this is an epidemic.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.438
Two girls have committed suicide.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.678
Don't do that, Pauline.
The first one doesn't count.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.198
I don't want that on my record.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.038
Well, maybe
you should have listened to me

06:51.040 --> 06:54.238
and tried to intervene with Heather
McNamara when you had the chance.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.718
You know that's not fair.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.838
No one could have known
that Heather McNamara was hurting.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.518
-She certainly didn't look suicidal.
-Her skin was flawless.

07:01.520 --> 07:06.480
What we need to do
is connect with these kids.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.118
-Radical empathy.
-What?

07:10.120 --> 07:14.518
I propose that we cancel classes
for the entire week.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.878
And instead, we bring everyone together

07:17.880 --> 07:23.558
to just sit in each other's presence
and just... be.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.238
Pauline, whenever you're ready to
climb out of the Whole Foods bulk bin,

07:27.240 --> 07:29.158
we'll be here having
an adult conversation.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.438
Maurice, we have to do something.
Maybe a bake sale.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.998
-Teens like muffins.
-Sugar.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.358
-We're gonna feed suicidal kids sugar.
-No.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.038
Principal Gowan, it's so interesting
that you say this, okay.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.838
These kids don't need radical empathy.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.798
They don't need a bake sale.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.278
What they need is something
that'll truly help them heal.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.198
What they need...

07:51.200 --> 07:53.278
is high school musical theater.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.398
Right? Yes? Thank you.

07:55.400 --> 08:00.478
Now, as you all know, I was planning on
mounting an upscale production of <i>Rent,</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:03.158
but in light of recent events,
I have been working on,

08:03.160 --> 08:06.918
in my own time, mind you,
an original musical,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.720
written by me.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.878
<i>Teenage Suicide: Don't Do It.</i>

08:12.880 --> 08:14.798
Music and lyrics by Maurice Dennis.

08:14.800 --> 08:18.598
Principal Gowan, the last thing
we need to do is glorify suicide.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.558
No, no, it says "Don't do it."

08:20.560 --> 08:22.598
It has "suicide" in the title.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.798
You clearly know nothing
about theater, Pauline.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.158
Can we maybe
make the word "don't" bigger?

08:28.160 --> 08:30.918
Well, you know what? Actually, these
are quite pricey to have printed up.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.717
I don't know, Maurice. This seems
like it could be in poor taste.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.837
Why don't we do <i> Our Town</i> again?

08:36.840 --> 08:39.278
-Nobody complained about that.
-Okay, well, then I guess that

08:39.280 --> 08:43.158
Mr. Steven Spielberg should never
have told the story of <i>Schindler's List</i>

08:43.159 --> 08:45.878
because somebody just didn't
want to see a swastika. Right?

08:45.880 --> 08:48.878
Or maybe Dr. King should have
kept it all in his dream journal.

08:48.880 --> 08:53.118
And maybe Candace Marie Bergen
should have just stayed a model

08:53.120 --> 08:57.078
and turned down a little show
called <i>Murphy Brown.</i>

08:57.080 --> 08:58.838
Well, I'm sorry.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.718
I'm sorry, you guys.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.478
But Maurice Dennis will not be silenced.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.038
Art, Principal Gowan, is bold.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.278
Art is vital.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.560
Art heals.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.840
All right, fine, fine.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.358
Put on your little skit.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.000
But one parent complains
and it's back to <i> Our Town.</i>

09:24.280 --> 09:25.878
Thank you.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.600
Thank you.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.838
Heather, are you going
to audition for the lead?

09:54.840 --> 09:57.118
Seth, what did we say
about speaking to Heather in public?

09:57.120 --> 09:59.078
Heather, it's okay.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.678
We're here for them now.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.438
Of course, I'm going
to audition for the lead.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.318
I'm always the lead.
And now, more than ever,

10:05.320 --> 10:07.158
Westerburg needs me.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.680
Pen.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.720
Heather, bend over.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.000
Heather,
aren't you going to sign up, too?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.518
The school musical's
always your thing, Heather.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.558
Heather, not having you audition

10:28.560 --> 10:30.878
would be like sending a dick pic
without a water bottle next to it.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.600
I need you there for perspective.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.238
I know everyone's talking
about Heather McNamara right now,

10:40.240 --> 10:42.958
but I still think Heather
Chandler's suicide was better.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.558
Heather M's felt forced.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.160
There wasn't a true moment
during any of it.

10:47.080 --> 10:52.198
So, have you given any more thought
to doubling with Ram and I?

10:52.200 --> 10:53.678
Yeah, I don't know.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.638
I don't really feel like getting
date raped on a school night.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.798
I know he seems like a total boat
shoe, but actually, he's really just.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.278
Please, Veronica.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.760
I can't bear to listen to them
talking each other out of IQ points.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.118
Welcome.
The outbreak began six months ago

11:27.120 --> 11:29.118
in Sherwood, Ohio and quickly spread,

11:29.120 --> 11:31.118
and you are the only survivors.

11:31.120 --> 11:35.360
Have a great day and remember,
you run and you're done.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.958
Do you have any other vest options?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.160
This one obscures my brooch.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.798
I feel like we should go
to college in New York.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.798
Or maybe London.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.958
Wherever I go, you have to go with me.

11:51.960 --> 11:56.678
God, that feels like such a far-off
dream, to be out of Sherwood, Ohio.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.878
Please don't talk to me like that,
Veronica. I'm not a lesbian.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.638
Oh, so you mean you don't want
to stay here and raise Kurt's kids?

12:02.640 --> 12:05.838
God, the thought of me
in a kitchen with a wallpaper border?

12:05.840 --> 12:07.280
No, no, no.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.758
Well, is the sex good?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.880
Veronica, who are you?

12:13.920 --> 12:16.478
And I don't know,
I only let him suck me off.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.838
I would return the favor,
but I honestly can't be bothered.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.280
Scooch.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.718
What about you?
Jackie 4Chan still doing it for you?

12:24.720 --> 12:26.838
I mean...

12:26.840 --> 12:29.998
I don't know, it's like one minute
I can't breathe without him

12:30.000 --> 12:33.878
and then the next minute, it's like,
he's just skipping Heather's funeral.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.918
And I mean,
I don't even know where we stand.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.520
Like, are we dating or...?
God, it's so confusing.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.678
I feel like we're either gonna
become the next Will and Kate

12:42.680 --> 12:44.120
or Bonnie and Clyde.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.078
What do you think, Heather?

12:47.080 --> 12:50.320
Oh, thank you.
I honestly just avoid sugar.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.358
<i>...caricatures.</i>

13:12.360 --> 13:14.158
<i>Actually, I have a little box.</i>

13:14.160 --> 13:15.560
God.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.638
And I tried to explain I was acting.
My rage was too real.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.398
I miss our wine nights.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.038
You know, I wish you had
come to New York with me.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.718
-You were so talented.
-No!

13:27.720 --> 13:30.640
Look at me, Martha.
You know it.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.958
-I wish I did, too.
-Yeah.

13:32.960 --> 13:37.558
To be honest, but then I got pregnant
with that little surprise.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.678
Well, hey, at least your big,
beautiful voice lives on in her.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.960
That's very sweet of you to say.
It is big, I'll give her that.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.238
-I guess she tries.
-What, tries?

13:48.240 --> 13:50.678
No, wait, Martha. Heather is amazing.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.118
I actually want her in <i>Teenage Suicide.</i>
I have a role for her.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.598
-No!
-Yes.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.198
What role would that be?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.358
Funny fat friend? Busty grand dame?

13:58.360 --> 14:00.478
Magical troll? Mrs. Claus?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.680
No! The lead.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.998
-The lead. Maurice!
-What?

14:07.000 --> 14:11.478
You do not have to keep on doing
this just to help her self-esteem.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.678
You are way too generous to me.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.798
-Okay.
-Frankly, I worry for your production.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.558
Well, you are the visionary,
I didn't mean to...

14:18.560 --> 14:20.678
-Thank you.
-I love a good boxed wine.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.080
Oh, me too.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.520
<i>And change teams!</i>

14:39.360 --> 14:41.798
Bang, gotcha.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.278
What are you doing?

14:43.280 --> 14:46.878
The owner said there's an antidote
or something in the armory.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.158
Yeah, this isn't really my thing, Ram.

14:49.160 --> 14:53.358
Okay, Veronica, not everything has to be
all dark and depressing all the time.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.560
We are in high school, I think you're
allowed to have fun sometimes.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.838
Okay, you know what? Tell you what.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.238
I promise I'll tell Heather that
you rolled your eyes the whole time,

15:03.240 --> 15:04.760
and it'll be our little secret.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.840
-Okay.
-Come on!

15:15.120 --> 15:16.598
Push, push.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.798
We're clear, so...
Okay, push, push, in the corner.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.878
Come on. All right, see?
That's the antidote.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.718
We just have to get that.
All right, cool, cool.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.958
Shoot! All right.
This is you, Captain Sawyer.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.678
I have faith that
you will save the human race.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.238
-Okay.
-You got this.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.518
I want to eat your brains.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.998
-Oh, shoot.
-Oh, no, that's okay.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.598
-You missed.
-No, it's okay.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.720
Just aim for that light right there
and you'll get it, okay?

15:43.160 --> 15:44.718
Die, zombie scum.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.038
-It was perfect.
-Good shot. I'm out.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.560
-Looks like you're on your way--
-Shut up!

15:51.360 --> 15:54.478
Well, you saved Ohio, Captain Sawyer.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.798
-Well done.
-Thank you, Lieutenant Sweeney.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.120
Yeah.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.198
We should go find Heather.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.920
Yeah, no, yeah, yeah.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.520
Just... just don't run.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.918
Who's the new girlfriend, son?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.400
Didn't expect you home, Dad.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.320
I'm Teyna, with a Y.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.318
I met your dad at Pilates.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.038
I just moved here from Louisville,

16:41.040 --> 16:42.558
and I don't know a soul.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.758
So, I decided to take a bunch of classes
just to meet people.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.718
I took spinning, I took yoga,

16:47.720 --> 16:49.518
I took what's called cardio barre,

16:49.520 --> 16:51.958
I took one of those pottery classes,
I took spinning...

16:51.960 --> 16:54.078
She's fascinating, son.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.198
-JD was just going to his room to study.
-Oh, never.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.238
You look like you haven't eaten in days.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.038
We gotta put some meat on those bones

17:02.040 --> 17:05.238
so you grow up
to be just like your father.

17:05.240 --> 17:10.078
So, tell me, JD, do you have a girl
that's sweet on you?

17:10.079 --> 17:11.758
A girlfriend? She pretty?

17:11.760 --> 17:14.518
I know it's not, like, the cool thing
with y'all young kids,

17:14.520 --> 17:16.518
but if you want my advice,

17:16.520 --> 17:18.278
I say you get married

17:18.280 --> 17:20.518
and have little ones
as soon as possible.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.280
Nothing more important
than starting a family.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.038
Marriage...

17:31.040 --> 17:32.480
is a wound.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.838
Marriage is fear.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.078
It's weakness.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.958
Marriage, Teyna with a Y,

17:40.960 --> 17:44.518
is the public announcement
that you are not whole as a person.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.238
And then on top of that,
to hold a giant celebration

17:47.240 --> 17:50.278
to advertise the fact
that you alone are not enough

17:50.280 --> 17:52.678
and you need an entire other human

17:52.680 --> 17:56.198
to staunch the bleedings
of your own inadequacies.

17:56.200 --> 18:00.518
And then on top of that,
to ask people to bring gifts

18:00.520 --> 18:03.118
to the celebration of your death

18:03.120 --> 18:04.678
as an individual.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.320
So, do I plan to get married?

18:08.560 --> 18:12.120
No. No, Teyna, I don't.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.000
This is great steak, son.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.120
I had a great time tonight, Veronica.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.480
I did, too.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.118
Well, good. I'm glad.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.480
Good. No, I'm glad.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.160
And I know that this...

18:56.240 --> 18:58.838
is probably not a very good time
to ask, but...

18:58.840 --> 19:00.800
Yeah, Ram,
I'm not going to sleep with you.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.760
I was just going
to ask if you were okay.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.240
Since Heather McNamara and all.

19:09.160 --> 19:14.358
I just figured if you ever needed to
talk to somebody about that, I would...

19:14.360 --> 19:16.320
I would totally do that.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.560
-Thanks, Ram.
-Yeah.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.000
Oh, no, hey, I can...
I can get that for you.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.320
Here you go.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.960
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.080
-Night, Ram.
-Good night, Veronica.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.960
-Bye.
-Bye.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.680
Kurt, go further down.
Someone could see us.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.080
Heather...

20:14.120 --> 20:16.638
Why do we always gotta do
all this sneaking around?

20:16.640 --> 20:18.398
My parents want to meet you.

20:18.400 --> 20:23.040
Well, tell them they can as soon as
their son learns how to suck me off.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.200
I guess it's probably not the best time
to give you this, then.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.040
It's my class ring.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.438
Pewter?

20:35.440 --> 20:39.040
I had it engraved with the first thing
you ever said to me.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.120
"Stop staring at me, urinal cake."

20:45.600 --> 20:47.040
That's really sweet.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.598
Fine, I'll allow your parents
to meet me tomorrow.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.078
Thank you.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.440
Heather?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.280
Good night.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.280
Good night, Kurt. God.

21:16.720 --> 21:22.678
Jade! Can you please clap your ass
to stripper music at a lower volume?

21:22.680 --> 21:24.640
I feel like I'm in Daytona.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.798
Hello, Heather.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.598
-Heather.
-It's funny,

21:33.600 --> 21:37.078
Veronica wasn't answering my texts
which, of course, is unacceptable

21:37.080 --> 21:39.078
because we have so much to do
to prep for my audition.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.438
And so, I went over to her house.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.158
And do you know
what Mrs. Sawyer told me?

21:44.160 --> 21:47.558
She said that Veronica and Ram

21:47.560 --> 21:51.438
were out on a double date
with you and Kurt.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.718
Now I think we both know
Veronica's a total boot-cut jean,

21:53.720 --> 21:56.318
so I expect her
to be making poor choices.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.958
-But you, Heather?
-Heather, I can explain.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.398
At first, I was like,
why would Heather do this to me?

22:02.400 --> 22:04.078
And of course, I started to plan

22:04.080 --> 22:06.918
how I was going to
destroy you at Westerburg.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.598
But then I remembered

22:09.600 --> 22:12.238
that you haven't been through
what I've been through.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.638
So, you're not enlightened yet.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.438
It's not your fault, you just...

22:17.440 --> 22:19.000
You don't know any better.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.760
So, everything is...

22:22.960 --> 22:24.280
okay?

22:25.440 --> 22:27.558
Did you eat a brain tumor
for brunch, Heather?

22:27.560 --> 22:30.118
Of course, it's not okay. You tried
to hide a relationship from me.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.598
You know I don't allow plus ones
without prior approval and as such,

22:33.600 --> 22:37.398
I'm gonna need you to break up
with Kurt tomorrow in the cafeteria

22:37.400 --> 22:39.678
-in front of everyone.
-Heather, I can't...

22:39.680 --> 22:41.840
Everyone needs to know
your crime, Heather.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.478
You brought a bachelorette party
into a gay bar.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.200
And now you have to pay.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.040
It's either us...

22:51.120 --> 22:52.560
or him.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.400
Hey, Heather.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.238
Kurt, you're not working out.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.360
But I lifted this morning.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.998
Kurt, look at me.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.680
-Okay.
-Now look at you.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.920
Okay.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.480
I don-- I don't understand.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.920
I am a mountain lion.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.878
And you're a cross-eyed dumpster cat.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.720
I tear out hikers' throats,

23:45.840 --> 23:49.918
and you chase
laser dots across linoleum.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.198
I make entire species go extinct.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.680
And you can, at most, dream of the day
when you learn to flush a toilet.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.040
Sure, we're both cats, Kurt.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.160
But cashmere and burlap
are also both fabrics.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.760
Us together just...

24:14.520 --> 24:16.440
upsets the natural order of things.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.120
And it would be rude...

24:24.080 --> 24:27.840
to allow all the other dumpster cats
here at Westerburg

24:28.720 --> 24:30.960
to continue thinking that they, too,

24:33.480 --> 24:36.760
could possibly, one day, date a lion.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.560
So, I have to break up with you.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.680
For them.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.638
Gosh, Heather.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.678
Super mean way to treat
the mentally challenged.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.000
Who is this?

25:14.960 --> 25:16.438
And what is that?

25:16.440 --> 25:19.278
This is Lizzy.
She's new and is in foster care.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.158
Hi.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.238
Lizzy's literally never had a home.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.840
Isn't she just?

25:26.160 --> 25:28.918
First, you make me break up
with Kurt and now this.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.038
Heather McNamara dies
and you fill our table with losers?

25:32.040 --> 25:33.440
Don't look at me.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.640
Are you done?

25:36.640 --> 25:38.358
Good.

25:38.360 --> 25:42.918
Come on, Lizzy. I'll show you where
all the best lighting at Westerburg is.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.080
Heather, grab our bags.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.358
Where were you?
We were supposed to get lunch.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.718
You know, a heads-up
from my boyfriend would have been nice.

26:01.720 --> 26:05.158
Boyfriend? Veronica, you make
what we have sound so high school.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.798
Yeah, maybe because
we are in high school.

26:06.800 --> 26:11.678
Okay, no. What we have isn't prom
or keggers before curfew.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.520
What we have transcends high school.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.560
I thought you weren't
like the rest of them.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.360
Well, maybe I am like them.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.038
Maybe they're not so bad.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.598
Maybe you just don't have them
as figured out as you think that you do.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.798
Actually, you know what?

26:30.800 --> 26:32.440
I went on a date with Ram,

26:33.520 --> 26:35.078
and I liked it.

26:35.080 --> 26:40.438
He wore his letterman jacket and talked
about sports and I had a great time.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.998
It was normal, JD.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.760
Something that I haven't seen
in a long time.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.638
Do you think you're going
to make me jealous

26:49.640 --> 26:52.118
because you went on a date with Ram?

26:52.120 --> 26:53.560
Because I'm not.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.678
Yeah. And why would you be?

26:57.680 --> 27:01.678
Because you are so beyond labels
like boyfriend and girlfriend.

27:01.680 --> 27:06.558
Right? JD, you think
that you are so much smarter

27:06.560 --> 27:09.638
and so much deeper
than everybody at Westerburg.

27:09.640 --> 27:13.040
I just see high school for
the totalitarian cesspool that it is.

27:15.440 --> 27:20.720
JD, you have the political beliefs
of a dorm room poster.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.718
<i>"Dear Diary,</i>

27:47.720 --> 27:50.880
<i>is it bad if I only went out</i>
<i>with Ram to make JD jealous?</i>

27:51.720 --> 27:54.238
<i>Is that even what I'm doing?</i>

27:54.240 --> 27:57.558
<i>Maybe I actually like Ram.</i>

27:57.560 --> 28:00.118
<i>Things definitely</i>
<i>are a lot easier with him.</i>

28:00.120 --> 28:01.918
<i>Whatever, Diary.</i>

28:01.920 --> 28:04.798
<i>I'm a girl and I want boys to like me.</i>

28:04.800 --> 28:06.878
<i>Call the goddamn cops.</i>

28:06.880 --> 28:08.958
<i>And not just like me.</i>

28:08.960 --> 28:12.478
<i>I want them to die for me.</i>

28:12.480 --> 28:14.478
<i>And you watch, Diary.</i>

28:14.480 --> 28:16.038
<i>It's gonna work.</i>

28:16.040 --> 28:20.198
<i>JD is going to come climbing through</i>
<i>that window any minute now,</i>

28:20.200 --> 28:23.400
<i>begging me to take him back.</i>

28:25.560 --> 28:27.320
-Ram?
-Hi.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.680
Can I show you something?

28:40.120 --> 28:41.480
Here we are.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.438
Heather...

28:45.440 --> 28:47.558
It's not too late to back out.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.680
I don't want my baby to be humiliated.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.238
Pick me up at nine.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.238
Oh, and Mom, Dad, this is Lizzy.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.718
We need to adopt her.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.478
Oh, well, I don't know...

28:59.480 --> 29:01.720
Oh, my God.
You guys never buy me anything.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.880
It's so nice to meet you.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.958
Turns out you shouldn't do
Tennessee Williams actually drunk.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.518
Heather,
why is Lizzy touching your face?

29:14.520 --> 29:17.918
-That's my job.
-Lizzy does a better contour than you.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.158
I've had to cover up a lot of bruises.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.518
Heather, the best thing you can do now
to make me look good

29:23.520 --> 29:25.118
is go out there and sing.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.078
The comparison
will definitely be flattering.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.398
Heather, don't you think replacing

29:29.400 --> 29:33.078
Heather M. with another person of color
is a little on the nose?

29:33.080 --> 29:35.320
No offense.
Lizzy, was it?

29:36.440 --> 29:38.560
Heather, you must be confused.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.320
Lizzy isn't the new Heather M.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.400
She's the new Heather you.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.838
Well, then maybe I won't agree to your
little audition plan then, Heather.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.478
Oh, Heather.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.758
Didn't you learn your lesson
when I was gone?

29:53.760 --> 29:57.638
You tried to take my place,
become number one and you failed.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.758
And why is that, Heather?

29:59.760 --> 30:02.438
Because being number one

30:02.440 --> 30:04.520
just isn't in your bones.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.638
You're a parsley sprig.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.078
You're a dinner roll.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.198
You're a side salad.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.720
Heather Duke.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.760
Knock 'em dead, lion.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.038
Okay, Lizzy, teachable moment.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.678
Whenever a friend steps out of line,

30:34.680 --> 30:38.718
you gotta yank that leash right back in
or they will walk all over you.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.640
You're the smartest person I know,
Heather.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.760
Let's take a pic.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.400
Document this moment.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.000
Ready?

30:51.520 --> 30:54.438
Oh, Lizzy, you have got
to find your light.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.078
You have so much to learn.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.800
Now go out there and cheer for me.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.958
<i>Teenage Suicide: Don't Do It</i> is a WIP.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.038
That's industry talk
for work in progress.

31:07.040 --> 31:10.480
So, we're auditioning you all
with one of the classics.

31:11.560 --> 31:14.318
Oh, and we actually
don't have the rights to this song,

31:14.320 --> 31:15.760
so nobody film this.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.718
<i>When the night falls down</i>

31:25.720 --> 31:29.638
<i>I wait for you</i>
<i>And you come around</i>

31:29.640 --> 31:33.358
<i>And the world's alive</i>

31:33.360 --> 31:38.038
<i>With the sound of kids</i>
<i>On the street outside</i>

31:38.040 --> 31:41.518
<i>When you walk into the room</i>

31:41.520 --> 31:45.478
<i>You pull me close</i>
<i>And we start to move</i>

31:45.480 --> 31:48.718
<i>And we're spinning with the stars above</i>

31:48.720 --> 31:52.678
<i>And you lift me up in a wave of love</i>

31:52.680 --> 31:56.278
<i>Ooh, baby,</i>
<i>do you know what that's worth?</i>

31:56.280 --> 32:00.078
<i>Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth</i>

32:00.080 --> 32:01.878
<i>-You say in heaven</i>
-Nice.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.078
<i>Love comes first</i>

32:04.080 --> 32:08.038
<i>We'll make heaven a place on Earth</i>

32:08.040 --> 32:11.320
<i>Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth</i>

32:13.960 --> 32:17.838
<i>When I feel alone</i>

32:17.840 --> 32:21.558
<i>I reach for you</i>
<i>And you bring me home</i>

32:21.560 --> 32:25.598
<i>When I'm lost at sea</i>

32:25.600 --> 32:29.638
<i>I hear your voice</i>
<i>And it carries me</i>

32:29.640 --> 32:32.478
<i>In this world</i>
<i>We're just beginning</i>

32:32.480 --> 32:36.358
<i>-In this world</i>
<i>-To understand the miracle of living</i>

32:36.360 --> 32:39.718
<i>-Of living</i>
<i>-Baby, I was afraid before</i>

32:39.720 --> 32:43.438
<i>-I was afraid</i>
<i>-I'm not afraid anymore</i>

32:43.440 --> 32:46.958
<i>Anymore</i>

32:46.960 --> 32:50.638
<i>Ooh, baby,</i>
<i>do you know what that's worth?</i>

32:50.640 --> 32:54.638
<i>Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth</i>

32:54.640 --> 32:56.398
<i>They say in heaven</i>

32:56.400 --> 32:58.638
<i>Love comes first</i>

32:58.640 --> 33:02.238
<i>We'll make heaven a place on Earth</i>

33:02.240 --> 33:08.720
<i>Oh, heaven is a place on Earth</i>

33:23.600 --> 33:26.038
Out of my way. Hello!

33:26.040 --> 33:27.758
Welcome to the theater.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.598
I think we found our lead.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.080
Welcome to the lead.

33:32.840 --> 33:36.358
All right, keep going, keep going.

33:36.360 --> 33:37.878
-Okay, are you ready?
-Yeah.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.358
-You sure?
-Yes.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.120
Okay. Check it out.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.918
Are we at Butcher's Bridge?

33:44.920 --> 33:46.638
Yes, yeah, we are.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.998
So, old town legend,
after General Westerburg,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.758
he pillaged and conquered
the Mickashawnee tribe,

33:51.760 --> 33:56.080
he took his squaw, Little Feather,
to this very spot to make her his bride.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.078
So, they say that
if you kiss at Butcher's Bridge,

34:00.080 --> 34:02.438
that you'll be married forever.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.558
Ram, Little Feather was 12.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.358
Yeah, I know.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.438
That was-- It was back in the olden
days, though, so it was cool.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.760
But...

34:12.880 --> 34:14.717
My parents kissed here,

34:14.719 --> 34:17.878
so I kind of thought it'd be romantic.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.199
But...

34:20.480 --> 34:22.838
I kind of screwed up, huh?

34:22.840 --> 34:24.480
No. No, I mean...

34:25.719 --> 34:27.679
I think that this is really sweet.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.518
And you made a picnic.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.918
Yeah, spaghetti with extra oregano,
just for you.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.518
And I got here a couple hours earlier
and did all the lights.

34:36.520 --> 34:40.080
I wanted it to look perfect, so, yeah.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.679
So...

34:47.800 --> 34:49.199
So.

34:51.719 --> 34:55.000
You want to see if the legend
of Butcher's Bridge is true?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.518
Damn it.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.278
Okay, all right, just hang on.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.878
I'm gonna fix that real quick because
I really wanted that to be perfect.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.478
-It was perfect, just hang on
-Okay.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.958
-Close your eyes, okay?
-Okay.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.438
I'll be right back.
You're not gonna leave?

35:16.440 --> 35:18.000
-No!
-Okay.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.680
Ram?

36:24.480 --> 36:26.080
You wanted me to be jealous, right?

36:27.320 --> 36:29.480
Well, congratulations, Veronica Sawyer.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.758
I'm jealous.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.478
I'm jealous every moment
I'm not with you.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.398
I'm jealous of every breath you inhale

36:39.400 --> 36:42.478
and every drop of rain
that gets to fall on your cheek.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.918
I'm jealous of every passing car

36:44.920 --> 36:47.958
that has the privilege
to wear your reflection,

36:47.960 --> 36:53.120
and wonder at how fucking
beautiful and perfect you are.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.558
And to ask Ram

37:00.560 --> 37:03.520
to even comprehend a girl like you

37:04.960 --> 37:06.600
is a goddamn crime.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.560
I need you to say something
because I can just keep talking.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.560
You had me from the moment
I saw Ram's lifeless body.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.000
I love you, Veronica.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.640
I love you too, JD.
