00:08.583 --> 00:11.208
Hey guys, we did a great job decorating.

00:11.250 --> 00:14.250
Our Halloween festival tomorrow night
is gonna be a blast.

00:14.375 --> 00:17.834
Yeah, but can we please change the name
from Boo-Stravaganza?

00:17.917 --> 00:19.792
No way! I came up with that.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.083
The "Boo" part is scary.

00:22.166 --> 00:24.375
"Stravaganza" is fancy talk for party.

00:26.542 --> 00:29.917
So, uh, Jack you know the Halloween
legend about our dojo, right?

00:30.417 --> 00:31.458
What legend?

00:31.959 --> 00:33.417
This place wasn't always a dojo.

00:33.750 --> 00:36.166
It used to be a butcher shop
called Meyer's Meats.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.166
On a hot summer's day...

00:38.250 --> 00:41.208
you can still smell the
brisket wafting off the mats.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.792
I always thought that smell was Jerry.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.500
Eight years ago on Halloween night,

00:46.959 --> 00:49.000
Mr. Meyers was teaching his apprentice...

00:49.500 --> 00:50.583
to make sausages.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.208
Oh! "The Sausager's Apprentice", huh?

00:53.625 --> 00:54.667
That's right.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.875
Apparently he did something
Meyers didn't like.

00:57.333 --> 01:00.875
Words were exchanged, pork started flying,
Meyers snapped.

01:00.959 --> 01:04.000
Picked up a meat mallet,
and when it was over...

01:04.083 --> 01:06.166
...his apprentice was dead.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.417
He was dead. Deader than dead.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.709
- He was so dead--
- Okay, thank you, Eddie.

01:13.291 --> 01:17.166
The legend, is his headless
body still haunts this dojo.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.583
Stop trying to scare me.
It's not gonna happen.

01:21.208 --> 01:24.208
- It's him! The Sausager's Apprentice.
-

01:24.291 --> 01:26.208
- I'll take care of this!
- What? No, no, no!

01:26.291 --> 01:27.458
No, no!
-

01:27.542 --> 01:29.000
No, no, Jack! Milton's in there.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.333
Yeah, see?

01:33.250 --> 01:34.208
Boo?

01:36.834 --> 01:38.166
Goodbye, Milton.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.625
Ah, Christmas nuts!

01:44.250 --> 01:47.458

02:27.542 --> 02:30.875
That psycho butcher story you made up
yesterday was pretty cool, Kim.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.667
Not to Jerry, he actually started
having nightmares about it.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.375
We told him it was based
on an actual legend.

02:39.208 --> 02:42.583
And that one Halloween night,
Mr. Meyers will come back...

02:43.000 --> 02:46.333
and bad things will happen
to whoever he touches.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.834
Why are you guys trying to scare Jerry?

02:49.917 --> 02:53.250
Hello... it's Halloween.
It's what you're supposed to do.

02:53.542 --> 02:54.417
So,

02:54.542 --> 02:57.250
I hear you guys are hosting
Boo-Stravaganza at the Mall.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.375
Sure hope nothing happens.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.250
What's that supposed to mean, Frank?

03:01.375 --> 03:03.250
What's that supposed to mean Frank?

03:03.333 --> 03:04.834
-
- Hey,

03:04.917 --> 03:07.250
we spent a lot of time
and energy on this party.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.750
So, I hope you and your guys
aren't thinking of trying anything.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.458
'Cause if you remember
when you try things,

03:11.834 --> 03:13.125
it usually doesn't go too well.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.917
Maybe you should take your
sister trick or treating.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.291
Maybe I will.

03:17.375 --> 03:20.834
She's gonna be a Princess
this year and she's gonna be adorable.

03:23.458 --> 03:24.959
- Okay.
-

03:25.041 --> 03:26.041
Hey, little buddy.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.709
You making a jack-o'-lantern
for that Boo-A-Palooza thing?

03:29.709 --> 03:31.166
Yes, I am.

03:31.250 --> 03:34.333
I want all the lady's to see
that I'm an expert pumpkin carver.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.834
Yeah, because that's
what all the lady's want.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.458
Rockstars, Quarterbacks
and Pumpkin carver's.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.125
Eddie, I want your guts.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.208
I'm kinda using them right now.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.667
No, your pumpkin guts.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.000
- Oh.
- Look...

03:49.083 --> 03:52.542
Every year, I buy a pumpkin to make a pie
and I throw out the outside.

03:52.625 --> 03:56.333
Every year ,you buy a pumpkin to carve
and you throw out the insides.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.959
Let's just buy one together,
and partner up.

03:59.041 --> 04:02.709
You're on partner. After school,
we're hitting the pumpkin patch.

04:02.792 --> 04:04.083
It's a date.

04:05.750 --> 04:09.083
Wow, I guess your pumpkin skills
did get you a date.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.417
It's with Marge!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.458
It's called a start, Jack.

04:20.792 --> 04:21.750
Wow, Phil...

04:22.417 --> 04:23.250
cockroach.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.875
Interesting choice for a guy
who runs a restaurant.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.500
But I guess it's keeping
in the spirit of Halloween.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.750
Eh, what is Halloween?

04:31.959 --> 04:34.709
Wait, you don't know what Halloween is?
Why are you dressed like a cockroach?

04:34.875 --> 04:38.750
Oh, health inspector came by,
we passed with flying colors.

04:38.834 --> 04:41.834
I want the customers to know
that I do not have cockroach.

04:42.667 --> 04:46.166
- The why are you dressed like one?
- So, that they know what I don't have.

04:46.375 --> 04:48.208
Then why aren't you dressed like brains?

04:48.709 --> 04:50.959
If I slap you, you feel it six times.

04:59.208 --> 05:00.583
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.750
Something I never thought
I'd never have to say...

05:02.834 --> 05:04.166
your tail is in my Baba Ganoush.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.792
<i>Oh, I am so sorry.</i>

05:07.250 --> 05:09.083
I was actually looking for a place to sit.

05:09.250 --> 05:12.625
This having a tail thing
is kind of new to me.

05:12.709 --> 05:16.417
Not in my family, we're born with them.
But they usually fall off by age five.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.083
- You are so funny.
- I'm so not kidding.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.291
Would you mind if I sit here?

05:23.750 --> 05:25.417
I don't know I never
ate with a cat before...

05:25.500 --> 05:28.041
You're not gonna lick yourself
and cough up a hairball are you?

05:31.125 --> 05:33.125
You are so hysterical.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.041
Oh, I don't know about hysterical,

05:35.125 --> 05:38.083
but you are looking at a man who knows
over 200 knock-knock jokes.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.875
Hmm, then maybe you should start knocking.

05:41.959 --> 05:44.250
- Knock-knock?
- Who is there?

05:47.250 --> 05:48.625
I can't remember any of them.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.834
Uh, excuse me, Rudy, I gotta get
these decorations outside.

06:09.750 --> 06:10.959
Oh, I get it.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.375
If I don't ask why you're sighing,
you're not gonna let me outside.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.709
So...

06:15.750 --> 06:17.083
why are you sighing?

06:18.083 --> 06:21.250
Glad you asked me that, Jerry. I'm sighing
because I was just shot with an arrow.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.792
Who shot you with an arrow?

06:23.875 --> 06:26.875
He's about yay big, quiver on his
back, wears a diaper.

06:27.375 --> 06:30.166
Oh, you mean Crazy Steve
down at the car wash?

06:30.250 --> 06:32.458
I'm talking about Cupid.
Dude, I am in love!

06:32.959 --> 06:34.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.250
- What's her name?
- No idea.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.875
- What does she look like?
- Not a clue.

06:36.959 --> 06:39.667
I just met her, and I've never seen
her outside of her Halloween costume.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.500
She's a kitty.

06:43.834 --> 06:46.333
Wait, you, you've never seen
her without her mask?

06:47.083 --> 06:48.333
Oh, that's not good.

06:48.875 --> 06:49.750
What are you saying?

06:49.834 --> 06:51.625
I'm saying you better find out
what she looks like.

06:51.709 --> 06:53.333
Your cat may be a dog.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.291
Dude, what are we doing?

06:58.375 --> 06:59.625
- I don't know.
- We should stop.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.417
Uh...

07:10.500 --> 07:11.709
can I help you?

07:12.250 --> 07:13.417
Oh, hey.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.875
- How are you?
- Good.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.291
- Uh, what are you doing here?
- I used to work here.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.375
You worked in the dojo?

07:20.458 --> 07:22.792
Uh, no, before it was a dojo,
it was a butcher shop.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.667
Maybe you heard of it, Meyer's Meats?

07:25.834 --> 07:26.959
I've...

07:27.542 --> 07:28.458
I've heard of it.

07:29.166 --> 07:32.667
If these walls could talk...
they'd never stop screaming.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.458
What's... what's your name?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.166
I'm Meyers.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.458
The butcher.

07:44.041 --> 07:46.667
Happy Halloween.

07:47.375 --> 07:48.875
I touched the butcher!

07:49.333 --> 07:51.458
Horrible things are gonna happen.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.250
If witches have all these magic powers,
why are they so ugly?

08:01.375 --> 08:05.542
Yeah, I know, if I were a witch,
I'd go "poof"... rich and beautiful.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.291
Guys, you're not gonna believe it.
Meyers the butcher's back.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.667
And he touched me!
Oh, horrible things are gonna happen.

08:14.709 --> 08:16.625
First of all, calm down.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.291
Second of all...

08:18.542 --> 08:21.375
Show me on this witch
where he touched you.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.208
I'm going to church.

08:24.291 --> 08:28.000
Free fries at Circus Burger,
all you need is a coupon.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.083
How about you, kid, you want a coupon?

08:32.792 --> 08:33.667
Clown!

08:36.417 --> 08:38.250
I guess he doesn't like French fries.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.709
Wow, what was that?

08:42.041 --> 08:43.375
Well, what do you know.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.291
We finally found something
Jack is scared of.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.417
Clowns.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.417
Or coupons.

08:52.041 --> 08:53.500
But clowns makes more sense.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.583
- <i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>
-

09:00.875 --> 09:03.125
Jack, I can't believe
you're afraid of clowns.

09:03.625 --> 09:05.542
- I don't know what you're talking about.
-

09:05.625 --> 09:06.458
Oh, he knows.

09:06.542 --> 09:07.834
He big-red knows.

09:09.792 --> 09:12.709
So, you don't like baggy pants,
floppy shoes, and that song...

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Stop it!

09:17.333 --> 09:18.417
It's true, okay?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.333
Clowns freak me out.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.959
Oh, you weren't just freaked out.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.458
You acted like Milton
every time he reads a pop-up book.

09:25.542 --> 09:28.208
Hey, some of those things
just come right at you!

09:29.959 --> 09:31.333
Jack, what happened?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.500
It was my fifth birthday party.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.834
My parents hired a clown,
but they didn't hire a very good one.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.917
Hey, you kids like flowers, huh?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.834
Yeah!
- All right.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.542
Ta-da!

09:47.208 --> 09:48.792
He just pulled those out of his sleeve.

09:48.875 --> 09:49.959
What did you say?

09:50.458 --> 09:52.375
Sorry. I said you just...

09:52.458 --> 09:54.333
pulled those out of your sleeve.

09:54.542 --> 09:57.083
You think I like being a clown,
you little punk?

09:57.500 --> 10:00.583
You think being a clown
is just a big joke.

10:00.959 --> 10:03.417
You think it's just, uh, like I had...

10:04.750 --> 10:06.208
I got bills!

10:09.875 --> 10:11.417
You killed a clown?

10:11.875 --> 10:13.083
Well, I thought I did.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.709
Turns out he was lite headed from
blowing up too many balloon animals.

10:18.959 --> 10:20.041
I hope you're happy.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.709
- You made me pass out!
-

10:22.208 --> 10:23.375
Mommy!

10:24.667 --> 10:26.917
So, who wants cake?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.417
From that moment on,
I've been terrified of clowns.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.417
After that story, I am too.

10:37.542 --> 10:39.500
Since then, I just avoid them.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.208
I know where every clown
in the city lives.

10:41.458 --> 10:45.250
Shaky McGee, Chuckles Watson,
Blato, Blimpo, and Uncle Giggles.

10:45.667 --> 10:46.500
Wow.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.458
How do you keep track of them all?

10:49.166 --> 10:51.417
Luckily, it's not that hard,
they all travel in one car.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I'll see you tonight, Jack.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.625
<i>Frank,
why is this door locked?</i>

11:04.709 --> 11:06.750
I'm practicing my evil laugh, Mom!

11:06.875 --> 11:09.041
<i>Well, stop it!
You're scaring the cat.</i>

11:13.834 --> 11:15.709
- I got this, I got this, here we go.
- Okay.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.667
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.

11:23.667 --> 11:24.709
I can't do it.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.125
I shouldn't have named it.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.250
You shouldn't have named it Bernard.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.291
You trying to get its butt kicked
by the other pumpkins?

11:31.375 --> 11:32.917
Just do me a favor.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.000
- Can you make the first cut?
- Fine, I'll do it.

11:37.208 --> 11:40.250
Bernard, this is not personal
it's just pumpkin business.

11:44.458 --> 11:47.458
I can't do it either.
I relate to this little fella.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.750
I was the smallest one in my family too.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.792
Seriously?

11:50.875 --> 11:51.959
- I wouldn't.
- Got it.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.542
Who says a pumpkin
has to be carved anyway?

11:57.166 --> 11:59.875
I could just decorate it
into something really scary.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.917
You should make a dude with a crazy
witch hair, werewolf fur on the neck,

12:03.000 --> 12:04.917
one eye going that way,
one eye going the other way...

12:05.250 --> 12:06.208
Aw, shoot.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.166
I just described my boyfriend Barry.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.709
Whoa!

12:10.792 --> 12:12.083
- I wouldn't.
- Got it.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.375
You know what,

12:24.458 --> 12:26.542
you should probably take your mask off
while you eat.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.083
I'm good thanks.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.834
You know what they say...

12:32.041 --> 12:34.667
"When in Rome, take your mask off."

12:36.000 --> 12:39.375
Rudy, it's Halloween.
Everybody's wearing costumes and masks.

12:39.458 --> 12:43.417
I'm not wearing a mask, my face is right
out there for full eyeball enjoyment.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.667
You're cute.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.458
Oh, I have to go, I'm volunteering
at the haunted house.

12:49.542 --> 12:52.208
No, wait, wait, wait. You got a little
hummus on your whiskers.

12:52.291 --> 12:53.417
Let me get that for you.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.208
- Rudy, I'm fine!
- Oh.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.709
I'll see you later.

13:04.709 --> 13:08.041
Let me guess, Phil, you're wearing
that because you don't have rats.

13:08.125 --> 13:13.542
No, I am wearing this for Halloween.
I have plenty of rats.

13:13.625 --> 13:17.166
Whoa! Hey! Hey! Where is everyone going?

13:17.500 --> 13:18.583
You know what?

13:18.667 --> 13:21.625
I don't think I'm gonna need this
frequent falafeler card anymore.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.542
Milton how long does it take
to put on a wolfman costume?

13:33.625 --> 13:36.041
<i>I'm coming.</i>

13:39.750 --> 13:42.834
What happened? I thought you were
supposed to be the wolfman?

13:42.917 --> 13:46.250
They said they would hold it for me,
but they rented out the last one.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.166
I had to be Little Boy Blue.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.500
Hey, is everyone okay in here?

13:51.583 --> 13:53.041
Uh, yeah, why?

13:53.125 --> 13:55.125
I told you, Meyers was in the dojo.

13:55.792 --> 13:56.709
What?

13:56.792 --> 13:59.667
The legend was true, the murder,
the butcher, the curse.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.917
Jerry, there is no legend.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.041
I mean there was a guy named Meyers
who owned a butcher shop here.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.125
But I made the rest up to scare Jack.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.041
So, you made the whole thing up?

14:09.125 --> 14:11.834
Yes! Now can we please
go enjoy our Halloween?

14:11.917 --> 14:13.583
Okay Miss Zombie.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.583
I'd hate to waste this cool
wolfman costume.

14:16.083 --> 14:18.542
They were saving it for some sucker,
but I paid the guy extra.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.166
Totally worth it.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.834
I'm the sucker, that's mine, take it off!

14:22.917 --> 14:24.500
Wait. Hey, hey no, I can't!

14:24.709 --> 14:26.000
I'm kinda wearing weird underwear.

14:28.291 --> 14:30.375
For what it's worth,
you make a pretty good Goldilocks.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.250
I'm Little Boy Blue.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.375
It's seven o'clock. Circus Burger's
closed so their clown's gone.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.458
Now, let's go Boo-Stravaganza
our butts off.

14:41.333 --> 14:42.500
Jack, what the matter?

14:42.583 --> 14:45.000
You heard what Kim said.
The Circus Burger clown is gone.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.125
-
- I'm not worried about that clown.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.166
I'm worried about...

14:48.250 --> 14:49.250
that clown!

14:52.250 --> 14:54.542
Oh, oh, there is a curse!

14:54.625 --> 14:56.625
Oh, and something horrible
is gonna happen to me.

14:58.125 --> 15:01.000
There is no curse.
It's Frank and the Black Dragons.

15:11.834 --> 15:14.208
The Black Dragons are trashing the place!

15:20.667 --> 15:21.750
Great!

15:21.834 --> 15:23.959
I spent six hours working on my pumpkin,

15:24.041 --> 15:26.208
and now the Black Dragons
are gonna smash it.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.625
No, they're not! If anybody touches
our little Bernard, they going down.

15:29.709 --> 15:30.583
Yeah!

15:33.458 --> 15:34.458
Let's go.

15:46.208 --> 15:49.333
Jack, you've gotta go out there.
If you don't stop this...

15:49.667 --> 15:51.458
I'll be little boy black and blue.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.750
You don't think I want to go out there?

15:54.166 --> 15:55.792
- I can't.
- Great!

15:56.125 --> 15:58.333
All the time we put
into the Halloween party,

15:58.417 --> 16:00.709
and the Black Dragons
are ripping it to shreds.

16:06.625 --> 16:10.000
Too bad you can't be like
Bobby Wasabi in "Blind Samurai".

16:10.834 --> 16:12.458
Even though he couldn't see,

16:12.542 --> 16:15.959
he used his other senses to wipe out
a whole army of ninjas.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.000
And, rode his seeing-eye pony
off into the sunset.

16:21.083 --> 16:22.250
That's it!

16:22.333 --> 16:24.667
Milton, you are a genius!

16:25.125 --> 16:29.583
Maybe so, but I would trade 40 IQ points
for one lone hair on my chest.

16:33.458 --> 16:34.792
You don't want any of this.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.458
- Whoa!
-

16:39.959 --> 16:41.166
Oh.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.458
I guess they do want some of this, my bad.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.709
Hey, you clowns!
I'm the one you want! Come on!

16:56.500 --> 16:58.417
Jack, you're talking to a palm tree.

16:59.667 --> 17:00.542
Yes.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.500
Hey, you clowns! I'm the one you want!

17:26.250 --> 17:27.917
What you smiling at, Pumpkin Head?

17:36.625 --> 17:37.834
Oh!

18:05.083 --> 18:07.000
There's your Little Boy Blue!

18:14.875 --> 18:16.667
Ha!

18:19.375 --> 18:21.750
Not so tough now, are you, Jack?

18:27.333 --> 18:31.083
Say goodbye Goldilocks!
- I'm Little Boy Blue!

18:36.250 --> 18:39.000
What are you doing?
I'm a clown, you're scared of me!

18:39.083 --> 18:41.041
I am, but that's my friend!

18:45.875 --> 18:47.333
- Boo.
-

18:53.834 --> 18:58.166
Dude, that was awesome! Nothing terrible
happened, something great happened.

18:58.667 --> 18:59.834
There is no curse.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.417
How'd you get over your whole clown thing?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.917
I had to face it,
I couldn't let you guys down.

19:05.625 --> 19:08.375
Thanks, Jack, my horn and I salute you.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.583
That wasn't the horn was it?

19:16.750 --> 19:18.583
- Sadly, no.
Hmm.

19:19.709 --> 19:22.583
Look it wasn't just me,
we all faced our fear.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.917
You guys were scared of the Black Dragons,
but you stood up to them.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.750
It was a fight to the finish,
but we saved Bernard.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.875
Guys, check it out.
This is the best pumpkin I've ever done.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.250
Wow! Whoa!
Huh, huh?

19:36.375 --> 19:37.792
Another salute to us.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.667
No, please, we're good.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.375
It's clear that I have
very strong feelings for you.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.083
But this is the moment of truth.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.333
This relationship can't go any further,

19:52.417 --> 19:54.709
until I see what you look
like under the cat mask.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.125
Okay, Rudy.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.000
It's really not that big of a deal.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.667
Halloween's almost over anyway.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.709
I can't believe I bought into that
whole stupid curse thing.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.875
I mean, nothing terrible happened to me.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.291
This turned out to be
the best Halloween ever.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.250
Jerry, what's wrong?

20:19.375 --> 20:21.667
She's not a dog, she's beautiful.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.709
She's...

20:23.792 --> 20:24.959
She's my mommy.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.333
Oh, I knew there was a curse!
