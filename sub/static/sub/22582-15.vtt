00:19.008 --> 00:19.963
Report.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.443
The lmperial Guard will die
at their posts...

00:22.568 --> 00:24.923
I know they are willing to die.
Will they survive?

00:25.048 --> 00:26.640
We're holding our positions for now.

00:26.768 --> 00:29.760
But the enemy's deployed new units
here and here.

00:30.328 --> 00:32.046
They're looking for a weakness.

00:32.168 --> 00:34.477
They may have found it.
We've taken more casualties.

00:35.928 --> 00:37.998
I've received a communiquÃ©.

00:39.208 --> 00:42.518
The Vulcans want to discuss terms
for a cease fire.

00:42.648 --> 00:45.765
Have you ever known a Vulcan
who wouldn't lie to get what he wanted?

00:45.888 --> 00:47.526
There is another option.

00:48.768 --> 00:51.726
Someone I've dealt with. A pinkskin.

00:52.568 --> 00:57.198
He's proven to be quite even-handed
in dealing with Vulcans.

00:58.368 --> 01:00.165
His name is Archer.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.757
It's been a long road

01:08.648 --> 01:10.684
Gettin' from there to here

01:11.568 --> 01:14.162
It's been a long time

01:15.128 --> 01:18.643
But my time is finally near

01:19.088 --> 01:22.637
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:23.288 --> 01:26.280
I will touch the sky

01:26.688 --> 01:30.203
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:30.408 --> 01:33.047
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:33.408 --> 01:37.720
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:38.048 --> 01:40.926
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:41.048 --> 01:45.246
I've got faith to believe

01:45.488 --> 01:48.366
I can do anything

01:48.488 --> 01:52.367
I've got strength of the soul

01:52.888 --> 01:55.766
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:55.888 --> 02:00.200
I can reach any star

02:01.488 --> 02:03.319
I've got faith

02:05.208 --> 02:08.086
I've got faith

02:08.967 --> 02:12.005
Faith of the heart

02:30.728 --> 02:32.241
You're sure he wants me?

02:32.728 --> 02:36.323
Ambassador Soval said your presence
is crucial to resolving the crisis.

02:38.368 --> 02:39.687
What's this planet called again?

02:39.808 --> 02:42.447
The Vulcan name is Paan Mokar...

02:42.568 --> 02:45.082
but the Andorians call it Weytahn.

02:45.488 --> 02:47.524
It's on a frontier between their systems.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.163
Both sides claim it belongs to them.

02:50.768 --> 02:53.566
They've nearly gone to war over it
twice in the past century.

02:54.368 --> 02:56.165
How do they expect me to help...

02:56.688 --> 03:00.601
settle a conflict they haven't been
able to resolve in 100 years?

03:00.928 --> 03:03.442
Soval says you'll be fully briefed
when you arrive.

03:04.488 --> 03:08.242
Jonathan, this is the first time
the Vulcans have asked for our help.

03:08.608 --> 03:11.520
You're the closest thing we have
to an ambassador out there.

03:12.168 --> 03:13.806
You know how important this could be.

03:15.768 --> 03:17.406
We'll get there as fast as we can.

03:28.928 --> 03:30.805
I don't like pushing
the engines this hard.

03:31.048 --> 03:33.004
The injectors are running at 110%.

03:33.408 --> 03:35.126
They're rated for 120%.

03:36.528 --> 03:38.325
Yeah, and my underwear's
flame retardant.

03:38.448 --> 03:41.281
That doesn't mean I'll light myself
on fire to prove it.

03:43.088 --> 03:44.919
I think we'll make it in one piece, Trip.

03:45.968 --> 03:48.641
I've been reading about Paan Mokar
in the Vulcan database.

03:49.008 --> 03:53.206
It doesn't say a lot. Class-D,
not much bigger than Earth's moon...

03:54.048 --> 03:55.800
claimed by the Vulcans in 2097.

03:56.768 --> 03:59.202
Class-D? That's uninhabitable.

04:00.328 --> 04:01.522
Why are you fighting over it?

04:01.648 --> 04:04.208
When the Andorians
first arrived a century ago...

04:04.328 --> 04:06.205
they began to terraform the planet.

04:06.608 --> 04:09.805
Once an atmosphere was developed,
they established a settlement.

04:10.568 --> 04:14.243
If it was unclaimed at the time,
why would there be a problem?

04:14.648 --> 04:18.322
Lts sole value is its strategic location
near Vulcan space.

04:20.128 --> 04:21.800
They were setting up a military base?

04:21.928 --> 04:25.364
- It was the only logical conclusion.
- Was there any evidence?

04:26.648 --> 04:28.161
How much evidence would you need...

04:28.288 --> 04:31.041
if the Klingons decided to set up
a colony on Pluto?

04:31.808 --> 04:33.321
That's not the same thing.

04:33.848 --> 04:36.885
The Andorians refused to let
the High Command inspect the colony.

04:37.008 --> 04:40.444
So, they annexed Paan Mokar
to protect their territory.

04:42.088 --> 04:44.204
What happened
to the Andorian colonists?

04:46.168 --> 04:47.237
They were removed.

04:49.568 --> 04:50.557
By force.

04:52.648 --> 04:54.604
They left the High Command
little choice.

04:55.808 --> 04:59.039
A surveillance satellite was put
into orbit to monitor the agreement.

04:59.368 --> 05:01.643
The planet's been deserted
for nearly a century.

05:02.648 --> 05:03.683
Until now.

05:07.848 --> 05:11.124
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.
In the three days it's taken us...

05:11.248 --> 05:14.763
to reach Paan Mokar, the situation
has grown considerably more tense.

05:15.808 --> 05:17.002
Unbelievable.

05:17.368 --> 05:20.804
I damn near burn up the warp reactor
getting here, and they make us wait.

05:26.888 --> 05:30.164
- Welcome aboard, Ambassador.
- Thank you, Captain.

05:30.768 --> 05:32.440
This is Subcommander Muroc.

05:33.728 --> 05:36.003
T'Pol's been filling me in
on the situation here...

05:36.128 --> 05:37.720
but I still have a lot of questions.

05:38.488 --> 05:41.127
If you don't mind, Captain,
I have a question of my own.

05:41.928 --> 05:44.396
Why would an officer
of the Andorian lmperial Guard...

05:44.528 --> 05:46.280
personally request your involvement?

05:49.208 --> 05:52.484
I don't understand.
I was told you asked for me.

05:53.168 --> 05:57.047
I'm involved in extremely difficult
and dangerous negotiations.

05:57.168 --> 05:59.557
I don't consider your presence
here an asset.

06:01.888 --> 06:03.207
If that's how you feel...

06:05.168 --> 06:07.602
we'll gladly continue with our mission.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.479
Six days ago,
an Andorian Regimental Commander...

06:13.608 --> 06:16.805
named Shran landed a force
on Paan Mokar...

06:16.928 --> 06:18.441
and occupied the settlement.

06:20.048 --> 06:21.037
Shran.

06:21.168 --> 06:24.797
Naturally, we attempted to enforce
the treaty of 2097.

06:25.448 --> 06:26.437
Naturally.

06:26.568 --> 06:28.798
We've regained control
of half the colony...

06:29.048 --> 06:30.879
but two dozen Vulcans
have been wounded...

06:31.008 --> 06:32.885
and three have been taken hostage.

06:33.008 --> 06:36.318
Shran has agreed to discuss terms
for their safe return...

06:36.928 --> 06:38.964
but only if you act as mediator.

06:40.248 --> 06:42.967
For some reason,
he finds you trustworthy.

06:54.048 --> 06:55.606
You're asking for my help.

06:57.048 --> 06:59.482
Yes, Captain, I'm asking for your help.

07:06.328 --> 07:07.647
I'll see what I can do.

07:08.488 --> 07:11.048
Forgive my candour,
but that's hardly reassuring.

07:11.768 --> 07:13.724
The last time you dealt
with the Andorians...

07:13.848 --> 07:16.043
a Vulcan intelligence site
was compromised...

07:16.168 --> 07:18.363
and a priceless monastery destroyed.

07:19.088 --> 07:23.366
Subcommander Muroc will accompany
you to represent our interests.

07:24.648 --> 07:28.323
Obviously, I'm here
at the request of the Andorians.

07:28.688 --> 07:30.599
Shran believes he can trust me.

07:30.728 --> 07:33.242
I don't intend to prove him wrong
by going down there...

07:33.368 --> 07:35.279
with a Vulcan officer in tow.

07:35.568 --> 07:37.604
If you insist I bring a Vulcan along...

07:38.608 --> 07:41.168
I'll take the one I know I can trust.

07:46.928 --> 07:49.920
- You wanted to see me, Doc?
- Yes.

07:50.288 --> 07:53.963
This planet is home to a rather
pernicious mutagenic pathogen.

07:54.088 --> 07:57.160
I'll need to bombard your immune
system with analeptic radiation...

07:57.288 --> 07:59.404
to protect you
while you're on the surface.

07:59.528 --> 08:01.723
- Bombard?
- It's quite painless, I assure you.

08:03.568 --> 08:04.557
What about T'Pol?

08:04.688 --> 08:08.886
Vulcan physiology isn't affected
by the pathogen. Shall we?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.680
This should only take a moment.

08:18.648 --> 08:21.526
If I may ask, how did your first
meeting with the Vulcans go?

08:23.168 --> 08:25.841
- Warm and friendly as ever.
- Ironic.

08:26.168 --> 08:29.843
They weren't overly enthusiastic about
you taking command in the first place...

08:29.968 --> 08:33.164
and now your presence is crucial
to their interests.

08:33.727 --> 08:35.366
It's crucial to ours, too.

08:36.328 --> 08:41.163
Maybe we're not out here to just
scan comets and meet new species.

08:43.048 --> 08:46.165
Maybe we're out here to prove that...

08:47.048 --> 08:51.439
humanity's ready to join
a much larger community.

08:54.328 --> 08:59.118
I intend to do that,
whether the Vulcans like it or not.

09:00.368 --> 09:01.357
All finished.

09:03.728 --> 09:04.763
Captain...

09:06.008 --> 09:09.159
I served as a medic
in the Denobulan infantry.

09:10.048 --> 09:12.482
If I learned anything
from that experience...

09:12.768 --> 09:16.044
it's that battlefields
are unpredictable places...

09:16.208 --> 09:20.042
even under a flag of truce. Be careful.

09:33.488 --> 09:35.479
We've lost the navigational sensors...

09:36.928 --> 09:37.997
and the comm.

09:39.088 --> 09:40.487
It's the Andorian jamming signal.

09:40.608 --> 09:42.758
I'm entering the landing coordinates
they gave us.

09:42.888 --> 09:44.321
Let's hope they're accurate.

09:48.008 --> 09:50.602
Did you have a chance to read
the Territorial Compromise?

09:50.728 --> 09:51.956
I glanced at it.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.799
The Compromise is
at the heart of the dispute.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.601
- It's worth your attention.
- It's 1,200 pages long.

10:01.128 --> 10:04.438
Did you glance at any of the other
materials I sent to your quarters?

10:04.688 --> 10:09.239
V'Lar's Treatise on negotiating tactics
is the definitive text on the subject.

10:09.368 --> 10:13.077
I got all of it. V'Lar's Treatise,
the revised Intersystem Agreement...

10:13.288 --> 10:16.803
the High Command briefing
on the border incursions of 2112.

10:16.928 --> 10:19.158
- I was up till 2:00 a.m.
- Glancing?

10:21.648 --> 10:23.320
Are you trying to tell me something?

10:23.808 --> 10:25.764
That maybe I'm not prepared for this?

10:25.888 --> 10:28.448
Ambassador Soval clearly
believes you'll fail.

10:30.688 --> 10:34.124
I was hoping some advance preparation
would help you prove him wrong.

10:35.768 --> 10:36.837
Thanks.

10:37.928 --> 10:41.364
But I doubt I'm going to impress Shran
by quoting Vulcan treaties.

10:41.488 --> 10:43.160
I assume you have a strategy.

10:44.088 --> 10:46.727
The first thing is to convince Shran
that he can trust me.

10:46.848 --> 10:47.963
And then?

10:49.608 --> 10:51.485
We're just going to have
to play it by ear.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.926
Are you sure these are the coordinates?

11:11.048 --> 11:12.117
Yes.

11:33.648 --> 11:35.479
Don't move, Vulcan.

11:36.848 --> 11:37.917
Captain.

11:42.608 --> 11:43.677
We're not armed.

11:51.088 --> 11:52.601
I'm Captain Jonathan Archer.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.561
I'm here to see Commander Shran.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.927
He's expecting you,
without a Vulcan escort.

12:01.008 --> 12:04.762
I wasn't told to come alone.
This is my Science Officer.

12:06.288 --> 12:09.041
She helped expose
the Vulcan listening post at P'Jem.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.483
I thought Shran might
enjoy seeing her again.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.448
I imagined my first diplomatic mission
would involve...

12:47.048 --> 12:50.723
sitting around a big table,
toasting with champagne...

12:51.168 --> 12:53.477
signing things with lots of pens.

12:55.688 --> 12:57.838
The pinkskin sense of humour.

13:04.448 --> 13:07.042
My apologies
for the security precautions.

13:07.408 --> 13:10.605
We can never be too vigilant
when it comes to Vulcans.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.687
They say the same thing about you.

13:13.448 --> 13:15.166
I'm sure they do.

13:15.728 --> 13:20.199
We're aggressive, illogical.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.117
Prove them wrong.

13:24.168 --> 13:27.683
That's why you're here, Captain,
to help us do just that.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.800
I've dealt with the Vulcans twice before,
where you were involved.

13:30.928 --> 13:34.603
Both times, you handled the situation
without prejudice.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.647
I hope I can help again.

13:37.848 --> 13:40.487
But the first thing I need
is to see the hostages.

13:40.648 --> 13:44.084
Hostages? Criminals take hostages.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.847
Kidnappers looking for ransom
take hostages.

13:46.968 --> 13:49.960
I assume you're referring
to the enemy soldiers we captured.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.324
The Vulcans want to know
they're all right.

13:52.568 --> 13:54.206
They haven't been harmed.

14:07.968 --> 14:09.117
Are you all right?

14:09.528 --> 14:12.326
When they attacked us,
two of my men were badly wounded.

14:12.888 --> 14:14.401
They're lucky we didn't kill them.

14:18.008 --> 14:22.001
You provoked this situation when
you violated the Territorial Compromise.

14:22.448 --> 14:25.997
Only a Vulcan could call
100 years of oppression...

14:26.128 --> 14:27.607
a compromise.

14:27.728 --> 14:30.686
You annexed a planet
that belongs to us...

14:30.808 --> 14:33.402
herded our people into refugee camps.

14:33.528 --> 14:36.326
After you set up a military outpost here.

14:37.248 --> 14:39.716
As you can see, Captain,
even after 100 years...

14:39.848 --> 14:44.444
this situation still evokes anger
on both sides.

14:46.888 --> 14:51.040
We will release our prisoners
on the following conditions:

14:51.728 --> 14:54.765
Immediate withdrawal
of all Vulcan military forces...

14:55.048 --> 14:58.165
the so-called Compromise
is to be rescinded...

14:58.288 --> 14:59.641
and the Vulcans must concede...

14:59.768 --> 15:02.919
irrevocable sovereignty
of Weytahn to Andoria.

15:05.768 --> 15:08.999
You don't expect them
to agree to all that.

15:09.328 --> 15:11.523
I told you. He's a puppet of the Vulcans.

15:11.648 --> 15:12.842
For the record...

15:12.968 --> 15:15.641
the Vulcan High Command
doesn't like me very much...

15:15.768 --> 15:17.724
and, frankly, the feeling is mutual.

15:19.728 --> 15:22.959
If all you need is someone
to deliver your list of demands...

15:23.088 --> 15:26.364
find somebody else.
I've got other things to do.

15:27.088 --> 15:31.127
The Vulcans always say
they're ready to talk...

15:31.248 --> 15:33.318
but it amounts to nothing.

15:33.448 --> 15:37.760
Treaty negotiations that drag on
for years. I want to speak to Soval...

15:37.888 --> 15:39.765
somebody who can
deal with the situation...

15:39.888 --> 15:41.958
without having to check
with his superiors.

15:43.568 --> 15:47.447
- I'll see what I can do.
- Here. On my terms.

15:48.168 --> 15:49.886
That might be a little difficult.

15:50.008 --> 15:52.647
- This is pointless.
- But not impossible.

15:54.088 --> 15:58.206
The thing is, he's going
to want something in return.

15:58.448 --> 16:00.837
Haven't they already taken enough?

16:01.048 --> 16:05.087
I'm talking about a gesture,
something to show you're serious.

16:08.608 --> 16:11.042
I came down here to see
about the hostages.

16:14.208 --> 16:18.247
- Why don't you let them go?
- And give away our only advantage?

16:19.608 --> 16:21.599
- No.
- Release two of them, then.

16:22.568 --> 16:25.207
Keep the other one
until after you've met with Soval.

16:26.448 --> 16:30.600
One, as a show of our good faith.

16:37.048 --> 16:40.165
- Unacceptable.
- You got one of your men back.

16:40.288 --> 16:42.848
And in exchange
you'll deliver me into their hands?

16:43.248 --> 16:46.445
I'm sure the Andorians were impressed
with your negotiating skills.

16:46.568 --> 16:48.763
They want to talk to you, not kidnap you.

16:48.928 --> 16:52.125
If I agree to a meeting,
it simply legitimises their position.

16:52.248 --> 16:55.001
And if you don't, these negotiations
end before they begin.

16:55.128 --> 16:57.198
That may happen sooner
than you realise.

16:57.568 --> 16:58.887
While you were on the surface...

16:59.008 --> 17:01.283
we detected
three Andorian vessels approaching.

17:01.408 --> 17:03.239
They'll be here in less than five hours.

17:03.368 --> 17:06.883
They probably intend to re-supply
their troops on the surface.

17:07.448 --> 17:08.722
We won't allow that.

17:08.848 --> 17:12.284
Engaging an Andorian vessel could be
construed as an act of war.

17:12.488 --> 17:13.967
That will be their decision.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.040
Both sides are responsible
for what happens here.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.126
You don't understand the complexities
of this situation.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.125
With all due respect, Ambassador...

17:22.647 --> 17:26.117
why did you agree to let me go down
there if you won't listen to my advice?

17:26.248 --> 17:31.003
I didn't request your help, Captain.
And I don't feel obliged to accept it.

17:31.328 --> 17:33.478
You claim the Andorians are inflexible.

17:33.848 --> 17:35.998
At least they're willing
to sit down and talk.

17:38.568 --> 17:40.365
The ball's in your court now.

17:42.608 --> 17:45.998
It's a human expression.
It means the next move is yours.

17:55.488 --> 17:58.207
This isn't wise.
The colony hasn't been secured.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.400
Didn't you hear the Captain?
The ball is in our court.

18:08.928 --> 18:09.917
I don't like this.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.278
With the interference,
you can't contact the ship...

18:12.408 --> 18:15.286
- if something goes wrong.
- They're expecting us. We'll be fine.

18:15.408 --> 18:17.205
Andorian ships will be here
in four hours.

18:17.328 --> 18:19.159
I plan on being back long before then.

18:19.288 --> 18:22.325
T'Pol said that Territorial Compromise
they were talking about...

18:22.448 --> 18:24.279
took eight years to work out.

18:25.448 --> 18:27.325
I'll try to speed things up this time.

18:32.128 --> 18:35.757
Bring them here as soon as they land,
and treat the Vulcan with respect.

18:35.888 --> 18:36.877
Yes, sir.

18:39.928 --> 18:41.077
If I may speak.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.642
You don't have to.
I know what you're going to say.

18:43.768 --> 18:47.204
We discovered this planet.
We made it liveable. It belongs to us.

18:47.808 --> 18:51.721
- Don't worry. It'll be ours again.
- How? By talking?

18:51.848 --> 18:53.520
We've been trying that for 100 years...

18:53.648 --> 18:55.127
and it's gotten us nowhere.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.565
They stall, and lie, and make promises
they never intend to keep.

18:58.688 --> 19:01.202
We came here to fight.
Why back down now?

19:02.728 --> 19:04.878
I'm willing to give Archer
another chance.

19:05.088 --> 19:07.044
You put too much faith
in these pinkskins.

19:07.168 --> 19:08.396
We know nothing about them...

19:08.528 --> 19:10.405
except that they're friends
of the Vulcans.

19:10.528 --> 19:14.282
Not always. I've seen that for myself.

19:14.568 --> 19:16.479
If we attack now,
we can have the Vulcans...

19:16.608 --> 19:18.997
on the defensive before our ships arrive.

19:20.168 --> 19:21.601
Your recommendation is noted.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.878
Our troops are ready.
There's no reason to wait.

19:24.008 --> 19:25.043
Enough.

19:25.608 --> 19:27.041
I value your opinion, Tarah...

19:27.168 --> 19:30.285
but that does not allow you
to question my commands.

19:32.488 --> 19:33.523
Dismissed.

19:42.168 --> 19:44.079
They'll send some soldiers to meet us.

19:44.768 --> 19:49.364
I'm afraid they'll want to blindfold you.
It's just a security precaution.

19:49.808 --> 19:51.366
Thank you for the reassurance.

19:51.488 --> 19:55.117
Now if you don't mind, I'll need a few
moments of silence to prepare myself.

19:56.608 --> 19:57.677
Of course.

20:00.528 --> 20:02.120
- T'Pol?
- Weapons fire.

20:02.808 --> 20:04.446
I can't pinpoint the source.

20:11.768 --> 20:14.680
- Archer to Enterprise.
- We're still within their jamming range.

20:14.808 --> 20:17.242
I suggest we cancel the negotiations
and return to your ship.

20:17.368 --> 20:19.040
For once we're in full agreement.

20:21.408 --> 20:24.206
Direct hit to our starboard engine.
Main power is off-line.

20:24.328 --> 20:26.125
You see who
you're dealing with, Captain?

20:26.248 --> 20:27.476
If you don't mind, Ambassador.

20:27.608 --> 20:31.078
- We're losing altitude, 200 metres.
- I'm going to bring us in on thrusters.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.277
100 metres.

20:37.168 --> 20:40.604
- 50. We need to reduce our speed.
- The ground is going to do that for us.

20:41.088 --> 20:42.203
Brace yourselves.

21:14.768 --> 21:16.201
Any idea where we are?

21:17.768 --> 21:20.646
The southeast quadrant,
near the old spaceport.

21:21.488 --> 21:25.481
I told you I negotiated the last accord.
I also served here.

21:26.888 --> 21:28.799
You were with the occupation force?

21:28.968 --> 21:32.040
As an intelligence officer,
a long time ago.

21:32.568 --> 21:35.321
Our current deployment has
a base of operations that way...

21:35.488 --> 21:37.319
about two-and-a-half kilometres.

21:37.568 --> 21:40.878
I appreciate your help, Ambassador,
but we're looking for the Andorians.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.728
Circumstances have altered our plans.

21:45.128 --> 21:48.359
I gave my word to Shran.
I intend to keep it.

21:49.248 --> 21:50.966
Shran just tried to kill us.

21:52.128 --> 21:53.527
We don't know that.

21:53.888 --> 21:56.448
I suppose you think our troops
are responsible for this.

21:56.568 --> 21:58.479
Sensors and communications
are off-line.

21:58.688 --> 22:02.317
There's weapons fire flying all over the
place. We don't know what happened.

22:02.448 --> 22:05.804
Are you that naive? Shran is using you.

22:05.928 --> 22:07.361
This is a man who couldn't sleep...

22:07.488 --> 22:09.160
because he thought
he owed me something.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.882
I don't believe he asked me
to come a dozen light-years...

22:12.008 --> 22:13.839
just so I could lead you into a trap.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.364
Right now, it seems
like the best thing to do...

22:19.488 --> 22:21.444
is to get a cease-fire in place.

22:21.648 --> 22:25.004
The Andorians won't agree to that
until they talk to you in person.

22:25.448 --> 22:27.962
I managed to keep us on course
most of the way in.

22:28.408 --> 22:31.559
We can't be more than a kilometre
from Shran's landing coordinates.

22:43.408 --> 22:46.718
How would you know? We can't pick up
anything through the interference.

22:46.848 --> 22:49.203
Our scanners are
more sophisticated than yours.

22:49.328 --> 22:51.717
We detected weapons fire
coming from the surface.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.520
Then your shuttle appeared to make...

22:53.648 --> 22:55.764
an emergency landing
somewhere in the colony.

22:56.008 --> 22:56.997
Where?

22:57.128 --> 22:59.323
We have been unable
to locate their landing site...

22:59.448 --> 23:01.643
but our units on the ground
are already searching.

23:01.768 --> 23:03.167
The High Command instructed me...

23:03.288 --> 23:05.597
to take steps to recover
Ambassador Soval.

23:05.728 --> 23:07.684
- And our officers?
- Of course.

23:07.808 --> 23:10.242
We want to be involved
in any rescue operation.

23:10.808 --> 23:13.197
We have more experience
in these matters.

23:13.528 --> 23:14.517
I know.

23:14.648 --> 23:17.799
I saw your commando units
blast the hell out of a rebel compound...

23:17.928 --> 23:19.327
during a rescue mission.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.082
We won't allow this provocation
to continue.

23:22.288 --> 23:24.006
You don't even know where they are.

23:24.128 --> 23:26.847
Do you think it's a good idea
to go there with guns blazing?

23:26.968 --> 23:31.484
Our response will be appropriate.
I'll keep you informed, Commander.

23:34.928 --> 23:35.917
Any luck?

23:36.048 --> 23:39.438
I'm trying, sir,
but if the Vulcans can't find them...

23:39.568 --> 23:41.445
- See what you can do.
- Yes, sir.

23:42.848 --> 23:44.679
How far away are those Andorian ships?

23:45.808 --> 23:47.480
Three hours at their present speed.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.799
That shuttle was to be left alone.
I gave specific orders.

23:55.928 --> 23:58.237
- And they were followed.
- Then who fired those shots?

23:58.368 --> 24:01.007
The Vulcans, I suppose, trying to kill
their own Ambassador?

24:01.128 --> 24:02.163
Is that so unlikely?

24:02.288 --> 24:05.121
Some of my men saw weapons fire
coming from their positions.

24:05.248 --> 24:07.603
It's Vulcan subterfuge, I'm sure of it.

24:07.728 --> 24:09.684
What better way for them to justify
an invasion...

24:09.808 --> 24:11.844
than to blame us for killing their envoy?

24:11.968 --> 24:14.402
They are devious, but I doubt
they would go that far.

24:14.568 --> 24:16.923
You act as if they have
some moral code.

24:17.048 --> 24:19.960
They have no conscience,
only their precious logic.

24:20.088 --> 24:22.204
They'll do anything to drive us off
this planet.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.637
We should never have agreed
to negotiate.

24:25.408 --> 24:28.127
You're not happy with the way
I've handled this situation?

24:29.608 --> 24:31.963
- Of course I am, sir.
- The Sector Two report, sir.

24:33.688 --> 24:35.007
Put all our positions on alert.

24:35.128 --> 24:38.279
I want Soval and the pinkskin
brought to me alive.

24:38.408 --> 24:41.559
If they're looking for an excuse to attack,
we won't give it to them.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.962
I'll see to it myself.

24:58.728 --> 25:01.196
Perhaps you were farther off course
than you thought.

25:01.328 --> 25:03.796
You've been here before.
I don't suppose you'd care to help?

25:03.928 --> 25:05.281
It's been almost 100 years.

25:05.448 --> 25:07.484
I thought Vulcans
had exceptional memories.

25:09.288 --> 25:11.040
This is the old residential quarter.

25:11.688 --> 25:13.406
According to our latest intelligence...

25:13.528 --> 25:16.167
the Andorians control the settlement
west of here.

25:17.848 --> 25:20.157
If we keep moving this way,
we should be...

25:20.448 --> 25:21.437
Down!

25:27.888 --> 25:30.197
Not quite the warm welcome
you expected, Captain?

25:40.048 --> 25:41.367
They're not shooting at us.

25:41.488 --> 25:43.922
The Vulcan units must be
advancing their positions.

25:44.048 --> 25:45.276
We should try to make contact.

25:45.448 --> 25:47.757
I don't recommend
sticking your neck out right now.

25:47.888 --> 25:49.162
What do you recommend?

25:49.288 --> 25:51.882
Wandering through these ruins
until we find an Andorian soldier...

25:52.008 --> 25:54.841
and trust he's been informed
not to shoot us on site?

26:00.088 --> 26:03.398
I'll take a look. Stay here.

26:03.528 --> 26:05.166
- Captain.
- That's an order.

26:06.608 --> 26:09.566
No offence, but my ears are
less likely to draw fire than yours.

26:10.408 --> 26:14.560
- What is their fixation with our ears?
- I believe they're envious.

26:15.648 --> 26:18.162
Do you realise you've picked up
a slight human accent?

26:19.048 --> 26:20.488
You were one of the most promising
members of my staff, T'Pol.

26:20.488 --> 26:22.001
You were one of the most promising
members of my staff, T'Pol.

26:22.608 --> 26:25.964
If you'd stayed in San Francisco,
you'd be the Assistant Counsel by now.

26:26.088 --> 26:28.397
You might even have a diplomatic
posting of your own.

26:28.528 --> 26:29.563
I'm aware of that.

26:30.568 --> 26:32.479
Then why have you remained
on Enterprise?

26:32.608 --> 26:35.600
We believed they needed our help
when they first developed warp drive.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.843
That hasn't changed.

26:37.408 --> 26:39.603
Captain Archer's record
is evidence of that.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.719
But there are others
who can assist them.

26:43.088 --> 26:44.919
I find the work gratifying.

26:47.408 --> 26:50.002
Gratification is
an emotional indulgence.

26:51.088 --> 26:52.806
You disagreed
with our recommendation...

26:52.928 --> 26:57.683
that Archer's mission be cancelled
after the tragedy at Paraaga Two. Why?

26:57.808 --> 26:59.719
I was on board Enterprise at the time.

27:00.248 --> 27:01.966
I felt my opinion would be welcomed.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.363
You believed you knew better
than the High Command?

27:04.488 --> 27:07.924
That sounds a great deal
like another emotion, arrogance.

27:09.048 --> 27:11.721
Perhaps it's time for you
to consider another assignment.

27:14.528 --> 27:16.803
Just because Captain Archer
has earned my respect...

27:16.928 --> 27:19.681
doesn't mean I've been contaminated
by his emotions.

27:23.448 --> 27:26.884
- Did you make contact?
- No. They're pulling back.

27:27.008 --> 27:28.123
Let's keep moving.

27:34.608 --> 27:35.643
Empty.

27:35.968 --> 27:38.084
They're probably trying
to reach the Vulcans.

27:38.408 --> 27:41.718
No. The pinkskin will want
to keep his part of the bargain.

27:42.488 --> 27:43.967
They'll be looking for Shran.

27:50.288 --> 27:52.119
- Commander.
- You have something?

27:53.208 --> 27:54.482
I can't be sure.

27:54.848 --> 27:57.806
- You see this EM differential here?
- That's the Captain?

27:58.168 --> 28:01.285
It's definitely a bio-sign.
I'm 90% sure it's human.

28:01.408 --> 28:03.638
At least we know he's alive.
Where is he?

28:03.888 --> 28:05.082
I need another hour.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.719
What's the status
on those Andorian ships?

28:08.968 --> 28:10.799
They just dropped out of warp.

28:10.928 --> 28:12.441
They'll be here in 13 minutes.

28:13.088 --> 28:16.000
I think the Vulcans see them, too.
They're breaking orbit...

28:16.128 --> 28:18.244
probably giving themselves
room to manoeuvre.

28:18.368 --> 28:19.926
Put the ship on Tactical Alert.

28:33.448 --> 28:34.483
Get down!

28:36.048 --> 28:37.083
Go.

28:46.248 --> 28:47.476
Over there.

29:00.888 --> 29:02.685
Those are Andorian weapons.

29:03.848 --> 29:04.963
Hold your fire!

29:08.208 --> 29:09.243
How is he?

29:10.368 --> 29:13.644
It isn't life-threatening,
but he needs medical attention.

29:16.608 --> 29:19.441
We've brought the Vulcan Ambassador
to meet with Commander Shran!

29:21.968 --> 29:23.287
It looks like two of them...

29:24.208 --> 29:25.926
one on top of that structure...

29:27.608 --> 29:28.836
the other on the ground.

29:33.368 --> 29:34.926
If I can work my way around...

29:36.248 --> 29:38.318
I might be able to come up
from behind them.

29:39.888 --> 29:41.606
What do you expect me to do with this?

29:41.728 --> 29:44.879
- Make sure they don't see me.
- I haven't fired a weapon in 50 years.

29:45.008 --> 29:47.647
You don't have to hit anything,
just keep them occupied.

29:49.848 --> 29:52.920
Really occupied
or I'm not going to get very far.

30:35.408 --> 30:36.477
Hey.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.407
- Range?
- 50,000 kilometres.

30:56.528 --> 30:58.917
They're still heading right
for the Vulcan ships.

30:59.048 --> 31:01.801
The Vulcans are charging weapons,
the Andorians as well.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.442
Travis, lay in a new course.

31:04.568 --> 31:06.399
I want you to put us right between them.

31:06.528 --> 31:07.802
Aye, sir.

31:08.248 --> 31:11.843
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you have in mind?

31:52.728 --> 31:54.286
Drop your weapon.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.483
I've never fired one of these before.

32:00.008 --> 32:02.203
I'm not sure if it's set on stun.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.687
T'Pol, cease fire!

32:07.008 --> 32:09.317
It doesn't have a stun setting.

32:15.088 --> 32:18.763
You fired on my shuttle.
You're trying to kill Soval...

32:19.088 --> 32:22.239
undermine everything that Shran
is trying to do here, why?

32:23.368 --> 32:25.598
Do you want a war with the Vulcans?

32:25.728 --> 32:28.925
All we want is a chance to fight
for what's ours...

32:29.488 --> 32:32.798
before cowards like Shran
negotiate it away.

32:33.368 --> 32:37.202
You can take that up with him. Let's go.

33:35.728 --> 33:38.561
We're being hailed by the Vulcans...

33:39.088 --> 33:42.205
- and the Andorians.
- Put them both on.

33:43.568 --> 33:45.001
This is Commander Tucker.

33:45.408 --> 33:47.364
Captain Telev of the lmperial Guard.

33:47.488 --> 33:50.605
Commander, I strongly recommend
you withdraw to a safe distance.

33:50.728 --> 33:51.763
I agree.

33:51.888 --> 33:53.765
We wouldn't want your vessel
to be damaged...

33:53.888 --> 33:55.162
by debris from the Vulcan ships.

33:55.288 --> 33:58.917
We will not allow the Andorians to land
additional troops on Paan Mokar.

33:59.048 --> 34:00.686
It's called Weytahn!

34:00.808 --> 34:02.799
And our personnel there
have been attacked.

34:02.928 --> 34:04.884
We'll provide whatever support
they need.

34:05.008 --> 34:07.966
Any vessel attempting
to enter orbit will be fired upon.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.158
That includes yours, Subcommander.

34:10.328 --> 34:12.398
We appreciate your support,
Commander Tucker.

34:12.527 --> 34:13.722
Don't.

34:14.128 --> 34:17.245
I'll open fire on any ship
that makes an aggressive move.

34:17.368 --> 34:18.516
Phase-cannons?

34:19.487 --> 34:23.036
- Locked and ready.
- This is not a Starfleet matter.

34:23.168 --> 34:27.400
As long as my Captain is stuck
in the middle of your war zone... it is.

34:27.527 --> 34:30.804
The Andorians have made it impossible
for us to recover Captain Archer.

34:30.928 --> 34:34.967
- By now, he's most likely a casualty.
- Don't count him out so fast.

34:35.288 --> 34:38.121
We've managed to isolate
his bio-signature.

34:39.888 --> 34:41.081
Now...

34:43.408 --> 34:46.797
why don't you both give him
and Ambassador Soval...

34:46.928 --> 34:50.806
a chance to do their jobs
before we start a war up here?

34:51.487 --> 34:54.480
He was ready to kill me.
You saw for yourself.

34:54.728 --> 34:58.437
Apparently, these pinkskins
aren't as honourable as you thought.

35:01.848 --> 35:03.201
Are you all right?

35:07.568 --> 35:11.004
I suppose I shot the Ambassador
to make my story more convincing.

35:12.048 --> 35:13.766
Why would my Lieutenant...

35:13.888 --> 35:16.960
a loyal member of the lmperial Guard,
lie to me?

35:17.168 --> 35:20.524
Commander, it seems you're willing
to resolve this situation...

35:20.648 --> 35:24.800
through peaceful means.
Do all your officers feel the same?

35:26.288 --> 35:29.439
Have you considered there might
be Andorians who would want...

35:29.568 --> 35:31.206
a war with Vulcan?

35:35.168 --> 35:37.477
How long have I served with you?

35:37.968 --> 35:41.483
Followed your orders
when it could have meant my life?

35:41.968 --> 35:44.482
She's not the only one
who risked their life.

35:45.888 --> 35:47.526
I said I'd bring Soval to meet you...

35:47.648 --> 35:50.162
and we damn near got killed
getting him here.

35:51.128 --> 35:55.087
I came because you asked me.
Because you thought I could be trusted.

35:56.048 --> 35:59.085
Check Soval's wound, check our shuttle.

35:59.568 --> 36:01.798
You'll find Andorian weapon signatures.

36:11.008 --> 36:12.521
Is this true?

36:14.968 --> 36:16.321
Answer me!

36:17.408 --> 36:21.560
- What did you expect me to do?
- Follow my orders!

36:21.688 --> 36:25.397
Orders to do nothing
while you betray us?

36:25.688 --> 36:29.761
It's not too late to redeem yourself,
to make a stand.

36:30.568 --> 36:31.796
I intend to.

36:35.288 --> 36:36.721
Take her.

36:38.128 --> 36:40.642
There are others who feel this way.

36:41.288 --> 36:42.641
You'll see.

36:50.248 --> 36:52.762
See to the Ambassador's wounds.

36:53.968 --> 36:55.606
We have a lot to discuss.

37:01.648 --> 37:03.320
The Vulcan ships
are breaking formation.

37:03.448 --> 37:06.804
- They're heading for the planet.
- The Andorians are following, sir.

37:06.928 --> 37:10.125
Arm the forward phase-cannons.
See if you can target their weapons.

37:10.248 --> 37:12.967
We're being hailed from the surface.
It's the Captain.

37:13.088 --> 37:15.443
Hold off, Malcolm. Put him through.

37:16.968 --> 37:19.926
- Captain.
- Nice to hear your voice, Trip.

37:20.048 --> 37:22.846
What's going on down there?
Are you okay?

37:22.968 --> 37:25.960
T'Pol and I are fine.
We're at the Andorian command post.

37:26.088 --> 37:29.763
Ambassador Soval's been injured,
but Shran's medics are treating him.

37:29.888 --> 37:33.085
- Did you say Shran's medics?
- He's just being a good host.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.278
The Andorians are allowing
the Vulcan ships...

37:35.408 --> 37:38.718
- to move in and pick up their people.
- Glad you let us know.

37:38.928 --> 37:41.761
Did you run into any problems up there?

37:42.568 --> 37:45.446
Nothing we couldn't handle.
I'll fill you in later.

37:45.568 --> 37:48.685
We had a pretty rough landing.
We'll need a ride back to the ship.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.685
I'll send Travis down in Shuttlepod Two.

37:50.808 --> 37:52.799
Acknowledged. Archer out.

37:54.088 --> 37:58.206
Put us back in orbit, Travis,
and cancel the Tactical Alert.

38:00.608 --> 38:02.758
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

38:02.888 --> 38:05.960
Ambassador Soval has begun talks
with the Andorians.

38:06.088 --> 38:09.285
They've been difficult, but productive.

38:09.608 --> 38:12.566
The lmperial Council
will not be satisfied...

38:12.688 --> 38:15.998
until Vulcan recognises
our claim to Weytahn.

38:17.448 --> 38:20.565
I believe someone once defined
a compromise as...

38:20.688 --> 38:23.486
a solution that neither side
is happy with.

38:23.928 --> 38:27.238
In that case, these talks
have been extremely successful.

38:27.368 --> 38:30.917
I consider any negotiation
that averts war to be a success.

38:36.688 --> 38:37.723
Join me...

38:38.768 --> 38:41.407
in a drink to celebrate...

38:42.048 --> 38:44.323
our mutual dissatisfaction.

38:45.248 --> 38:47.079
Vulcans don't drink.

38:51.208 --> 38:53.881
But this occasion merits an exception.

39:02.888 --> 39:04.241
To the cease fire.

39:04.768 --> 39:08.317
It wouldn't have been possible
without the help of our human friends.

39:08.448 --> 39:12.521
And to the successful continuation
of these talks on Andoria.

39:13.208 --> 39:17.121
I trust there'll be more accomplished
than just talk.

39:30.768 --> 39:34.317
With your permission, I'll escort
Ambassador Soval to the airlock.

39:34.608 --> 39:35.643
Of course.

39:41.968 --> 39:43.560
Captain...

39:44.088 --> 39:47.478
your presence here has not been...

39:48.168 --> 39:49.886
overly meddlesome.

40:03.448 --> 40:05.803
I think he likes you, pinkskin.

40:07.888 --> 40:09.480
I wouldn't go that far.
