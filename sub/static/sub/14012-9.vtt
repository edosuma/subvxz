00:06.407 --> 00:08.340
<i> The police,</i>

<i> and the district attorneys,</i>

<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:13.781 --> 00:16.415
Come on, O.J.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.050
Come on, heel.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.118
O.J., heel.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.119
Heel.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.086
(<i> whimpering</i> )

00:21.088 --> 00:22.321
Come on.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.425
All right, sit.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.529
You, you, you, you, you.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.915
<i> You.</i>

00:32.916 --> 00:35.300
If you want that dog to do
tricks, you gotta hit him.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.569
Want to teach him to bite,
then you hit him.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.238
You like the Jets
Sunday?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.473
Yeah, if Thomas
gets his carries.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.109
I'll give you
ten points.
Take 'em.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.378
That's what you said
last week.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.480
And this week
I'm probably right.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.350
Come on, O.J.
Let's go home.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.518
Come on.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.286
Come on, O.J.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.522
We got TV to watch.
Come on.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.590
(<i> engine starts</i> )

01:13.674 --> 01:16.675
Looks like the pooch
got off scot-free.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.410
But that's the last

01:18.412 --> 01:20.679
he's heard of
his master's voice.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.514
No skid marks.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.650
Any I.D. on the body?

01:24.652 --> 01:26.852
Lawrence Kealey,
325 West 82nd Street.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.354
Just around
the corner.

01:29.356 --> 01:32.291
You want us
to take him home?

01:32.293 --> 01:35.260
Wait until we break the news,
then bring him up.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.563
We got about
20 more minutes here.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.332
The street's nice and quiet,
okay? No traffic, no nothing.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.435
Then this big black car just
comes along and hits him-- boom.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.571
Big, black,
what kind of car?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.573
Mercedes, black,
maybe dark blue.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.208
You're not sure?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.376
Street lights
make everything funny.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.011
Definitely a Mercedes.
All right, good.

01:53.012 --> 01:54.645
That narrows it down.
Did you happen to see
the license plate?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.281
Maybe the driver?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.583
No. Here's the weird thing.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.352
I see the same car before this
happened parked

02:00.354 --> 02:01.687
across the street.
I noticed because it's just

02:01.689 --> 02:03.288
sitting there
with the parking lights on

02:03.290 --> 02:04.690
then later with them off.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.592
Slow down. Where was this?

02:06.594 --> 02:07.893
All the way down the block.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.395
A guy starts to cross,
car pulls out.

02:10.397 --> 02:11.730
Guy crosses, car hits him.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.298
He made no attempt to swerve?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.466
Swerve?

02:14.468 --> 02:17.469
The only thing the car did
was accelerate.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.239
Boom-- lights came on,
action, camera.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.175
Oh, he was gunning
for the guy, all right.

02:24.478 --> 02:28.547

   NBC/UNIVERSAL

03:46.660 --> 03:49.428
I knew something was wrong.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.829
I knew it.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.269
He'd always walk O.J.
after<i> Carson.</i>

03:59.306 --> 04:02.641
Mrs. Kealey,
can we call someone?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.413
He wanted ice cream.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.329
Where is O.J..?

04:24.331 --> 04:25.664
He's fine.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.301
One of the officers
will be bringing him up.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.774
Did you talk to him?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.442
He was already...

04:40.281 --> 04:43.282
The paramedics said he died
from head wounds.

04:43.284 --> 04:46.351
LOGAN:
He was gone
before they got there.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.922
What do I do?

04:55.029 --> 04:57.429
I mean now.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.867
What am I supposed to do now?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.838
Shame. Good people.
Makes you think.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.840
You see Larry
every night?

05:08.842 --> 05:09.841
Clockwork.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.376
We'd talk sports, whatever.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.911
Guy still liked the Jets.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.913
He invited me to First Base.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.049
He said he'd set me up.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.383
A sports bar.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.985
Down in Chelsea,
23rd Street.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.420
Larry tended bar.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.921
A bartender affords
a place like this?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.857
The miracle
of rent control.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.792
The Kealeys were here before
the building converted.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.926
Squatters' rights.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.494
So they're still renting.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.962
540 per.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.432
Some people have
all the luck.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.400
Yeah, some luck.

05:35.402 --> 05:39.338
BARTENDER:
<i> Where I come from,</i>
<i> you use a shot glass</i>

05:39.340 --> 05:40.739
to pour a drink.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.342
He liked to pour
from the bottle.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.344
Give the customers
an extra ounce.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.346
Not exactly
a character flaw.

05:47.348 --> 05:50.115
No great trick being a big shot
with someone else's booze.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.351
How well did you know him?

05:52.353 --> 05:53.352
We'd talk.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.753
Our shifts overlapped.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.356
See, I start at 4:00,
he quits at 6:00.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.958
Except when we switched
on Monday nights.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.126
Why the switch?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.779
He wanted to be working

06:03.780 --> 06:06.431
when his buddies came in and
watched<i> Monday Night Football.</i>

06:06.433 --> 06:08.967
The kid played ball--
quarterback, Syracuse.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.969
Drafted by Cincinnati.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.438
What happened--
he didn't make the cut?

06:13.440 --> 06:16.108
He was six weeks
before training camp

06:16.110 --> 06:18.443
two on two at the Y...

06:18.445 --> 06:19.578
Knee goes out--

06:19.580 --> 06:21.113
that's all she wrote.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.982
I've seen a million
just like him.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.450
Never get over it.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.420
Always trying
to score the big one.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.755
Any women?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.390
Nah.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.524
Larry's married.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.959
Nice girl.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.095
Teaches at some
fancy prep school.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.831
His only vice was point spreads.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.401
CERRETA:
Friendly bets
or real action?

06:42.403 --> 06:45.537
Well, one bookie comes in here
named Fine.

06:45.539 --> 06:49.174
I, uh, wouldn't call him
a friend, you know?

06:51.011 --> 06:53.478
<i> Larry the loser.</i>

06:53.480 --> 06:55.514
You name it--

06:55.515 --> 06:57.549
<i> jai alai,</i> trotters,
high school football.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.117
What about recently?

06:59.119 --> 07:01.486
Stopped taking his action
months ago.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.521
What happened?
He get in

07:02.523 --> 07:03.789
over his head?

07:03.791 --> 07:04.990
Up to his follicles.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.925
Bets the Donald couldn't cover.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.994
That tick you off, Harry?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.429
Come on, what do I look--
stupid?

07:10.431 --> 07:13.899
If I kill the guy,
I'll never see any cash.

07:13.901 --> 07:17.903
So you just sell the debt
to someone a little tougher.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.171
Hey, Detective,

07:19.173 --> 07:22.174
I don't look for trouble,
you know?

07:22.176 --> 07:24.643
He was a loss.
That's all.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.178
I cut him off.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.046
End of story.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.449
So, maybe he pays a visit
to a loan shark.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.851
Figures he's going
to get out of debt.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.119
Dead guys never pay.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.189
That's why sharks
don't murder-- they maim.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.958
Maybe Larry wasn't
supposed to get dead.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.227
At 50 miles an hour
head-on? Come on.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.830
Hey, they're loan sharks,
they ain't Fulbright scholars.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.231
Mike, it doesn't play.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.532
Okay, option two--

07:47.534 --> 07:48.967
he's in a hole, right?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.937
Figures he's going
to make a quick buck.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.639
So what-- he puts together
a drug deal?

07:54.641 --> 07:56.641
How many times we seen it?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.478
Some idiot thinks
he'll cash out quickly, right?

07:59.480 --> 08:03.248
Gets in over his head,
floats his supplier for a while

08:03.250 --> 08:05.250
and it's bam-- see ya.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.987
Well, we have to find out
how deep that hole was, huh?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.490
That's right. Let's rock 'n'
roll, Big Daddy.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.492
We are beginning to believe

08:13.494 --> 08:16.561
that this may not have been
an accident.

08:18.232 --> 08:21.099
How long had he been
gambling for?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.201
I thought he stopped.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.903
He promised.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.273
Was this recently?

08:28.275 --> 08:31.543
Six months, I guess.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.983
He always needed a thrill.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.652
After football, he was lost.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.624
I hated it.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.660
But I understood it.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.029
Did you ever have any visitors?

08:51.031 --> 08:54.199
Any calls come to the house
by people...?

08:54.201 --> 08:57.135
He kept it out of the house.
I insisted.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.604
Did he mention
any names?

08:59.606 --> 09:01.706
What about money?

09:01.708 --> 09:05.010
Larry owed everyone

09:05.012 --> 09:07.245
at one time or another.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.282
He paid it all off,
I thought.

09:10.284 --> 09:12.284
With what?

09:13.320 --> 09:17.255
Savings, friends...

09:17.257 --> 09:19.624
ex-friends, his parents.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.192
Did he ever borrow

09:21.194 --> 09:24.296
from anybody less...
respectable?

09:27.634 --> 09:30.268
Mrs. Kealey,
anything might help.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.309
Larry did a lot
of stupid things.

09:37.311 --> 09:41.646
When it started to get bad,
we got scared.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.715
He swore he stopped.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.319
How bad did it get?

09:50.190 --> 09:53.158
He got pushed around a little.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.760
About a year ago.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.664
No.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.734
I don't know who did it.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.206
CERRETA:
<i> They have a lot of visitors?</i>

10:08.208 --> 10:09.207
Sure.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.209
People come and people go.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.645
What, is that
against the law now?

10:13.647 --> 10:14.813
Sit.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.215
Actually, we're interested
in Larry Kealey.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.217
Did you ever see anyone...

10:19.219 --> 10:21.219
What am I, a snoop?

10:21.221 --> 10:25.256
Well, some things
you just can't avoid.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.692
Such as?
Now, this building

10:27.694 --> 10:30.228
was built before you were born.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.164
And through walls
like these

10:33.166 --> 10:34.833
you're not supposed to hear.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.301
Are you saying

10:36.302 --> 10:37.768
that you actually heard
something, Mr. Isaacson?

10:37.771 --> 10:40.772
Oh, I heard plenty,
let me tell you.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.341
Sometimes they fought
like cats and dogs.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.343
Who, Larry and a friend?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.813
He and the missus.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.150
And that music of theirs-- ugh!

10:52.152 --> 10:54.252
One night
a couple weeks ago

10:54.254 --> 10:57.322
I knocked on their door and I
said, "I can't take it anymore.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.124
I just can't take it."

10:59.126 --> 11:02.093
What, the fighting or the music?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.229
That time it was a fight.

11:04.231 --> 11:07.699
Then she came out of the bedroom
half-naked.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.368
"Sorry.
We didn't know you were home."

11:10.370 --> 11:11.836
They didn't know.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.272
Come on, where would I go?

11:14.274 --> 11:17.342
Do you remember
what night that was?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.079
No, but the next day

11:21.081 --> 11:23.448
I complained
to the manager.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.217
Talk to him if you want
the date.

11:26.219 --> 11:29.320
LOGAN:
What, is all that
just for complaints?

11:29.322 --> 11:32.390
Complaints, repairs...

11:32.392 --> 11:34.159
requests
for the painter,

11:34.161 --> 11:35.226
the exterminator.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.362
Only thing missing
is the praise.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.831
That's for the next life,
my friend.

11:39.833 --> 11:40.865
You got it.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.367
Okay, here we are.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.703
Mr. Isaacson.

11:44.705 --> 11:48.840
October 1st and the 8th
and the 15th.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.910
LOGAN:
He said
he just complained once.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.812
Mr. Isaacson was obsessed.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.915
He told me he wouldn't rest

11:56.917 --> 11:59.184
until the Kealeys
were evicted.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.286
Fat chance then.
No chance now.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.238
How come?

12:03.239 --> 12:05.189
Jenna Kealey
just bought her apartment.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.193
After her husband died?

12:08.195 --> 12:12.163
Very next day she came in
and signed the contract.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.772
I wasn't hiding anything.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.824
You didn't ask.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.875
Why should I start talking
about real estate

12:24.878 --> 12:28.780
two days
after my husband died?

12:28.782 --> 12:31.015
Well, you start
buying real estate

12:31.017 --> 12:33.151
a day after he died.

12:33.153 --> 12:39.824
I mean, most people would say
a little mourning was in order.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.861
I was mourning in private,
Detective.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.829
You must admit

12:44.831 --> 12:46.898
it seems a little odd,
Mrs. Kealey.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.869
The building went co-op
almost three months ago.

12:50.871 --> 12:54.339
Everyone had 90 days to buy
at the insider's price--

12:54.341 --> 12:56.074
30% below
market value.

12:56.076 --> 12:59.077
And suddenly you've got
a life insurance policy

12:59.079 --> 13:00.111
about to pay off.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.513
Exactly.

13:01.515 --> 13:05.283
It made sense for me to do it
right away.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.953
The D.M.V. says there are
24,000 Mercedes in the city.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.890
Did we miss something
in the go-go '80s?

13:11.892 --> 13:14.259
Speak for yourself Big Daddy.
I had a great time.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.326
Hello.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.561
Yeah.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.096
Uh-huh.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.231
Thank you very much.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.835
150,000 on his policy.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.570
Is that enough
to kill for?

13:25.572 --> 13:27.238
Maybe not,
but 300,000 is.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.042
In case of accident
double indemnity, huh?

13:31.978 --> 13:34.379
What?

13:34.381 --> 13:37.182
Let's go see Cragen.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.118
My son's birthday's
on October 8.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.886
This year it's
on a Tuesday.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.822
Just like all three days

13:43.824 --> 13:45.957
that Mr. Isaacson, the next-door
neighbor, complained.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.926
Which is the day after
<i> Monday Night Football...</i>

13:47.928 --> 13:50.929
Exactly, which Larry
always watched with his
buddies in the bar.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.598
Well, looks like the missus
didn't like to be alone.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.067
Go ask her who
her playmate was.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.302
Charity usually
begins at home.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.970
Adultery usually begins
on the job.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.840
Let's see what we can do
without asking her.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.378
<i> I'm the principal...</i>

14:07.380 --> 14:09.113
not the social director.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.616
I don't keep tabs.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.853
Mrs. Branson,
we just want to know.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.855
Is she a suspect in this?

14:16.857 --> 14:20.859
I mean, if I have
to be concerned for
people's safety here...

14:20.861 --> 14:22.927
Excuse me, we're not sure yet
what happened in this case.

14:22.929 --> 14:23.962
This is standard background.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.096
Nothing else.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.231
Syracuse '89.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.365
Math major.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.101
Students seem to like her.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.302
Any friends

14:31.304 --> 14:32.937
among the teachers?

14:32.939 --> 14:35.440
I've seen her lunch
with Caroll Woodward,

14:35.442 --> 14:36.908
the science teacher.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.077
Where might we find
Miss Woodward?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.311
<i> Mr.</i> Woodward.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.447
He's in 203.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.950
Day I realized I wasn't Einstein

14:45.952 --> 14:49.320
went home and downed a bottle
of good Mexican tequila.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.622
Great expectations--

14:50.624 --> 14:53.324
all teachers
start out with them.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.059
What about Jenna?

14:55.061 --> 14:58.062
Hasn't got
over them yet.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.098
What? She thinks
she's some kind of scholar?

15:00.100 --> 15:03.368
Jenna's expectations
are not so cerebral.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.236
Jenna expects five acres

15:05.238 --> 15:08.039
preferably in Greenwich,
Connecticut.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.941
On a teacher's salary?

15:09.943 --> 15:10.942
She thinks that's possible?

15:10.944 --> 15:12.644
What mattered
to her was

15:12.646 --> 15:14.646
whether<i> we</i> thought
it was possible.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.981
She's a real product
of the '80s.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.284
All done with mirrors.
To Jenna appearance
equals reality.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.919
You sound like you
were pretty close.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.353
We ate lunch,
couple of committees.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.223
Any extracurricular activity?

15:25.225 --> 15:26.324
I'm single.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.692
I thought about it.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.993
Just thought, huh?

15:28.995 --> 15:31.429
Hey, the size of her husband?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.965
I decided look, no touch.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.700
You knew
Lawrence Kealey?

15:35.702 --> 15:36.668
Saw him once.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.136
Talk about a temper.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.971
Came here
looking for Jen.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.973
Flipped when
she wasn't here.

15:41.975 --> 15:42.941
What kind of flipped?

15:42.943 --> 15:45.444
Called her a whore.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.946
Said, "If she's with
that Pack kid again
I'll kill her."

15:47.948 --> 15:49.080
What Pack kid?

15:49.082 --> 15:51.032
Roy Pack.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.983
A junior she's been tutoring
for the S.A.T.s

15:52.986 --> 15:56.721
In subjects other than math?

15:56.723 --> 15:59.390
They spend
a lot of time together.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.427
That's all I know.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.430
Doesn't prove there was anything
more than teacher/student.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.432
Yeah, and the husband
blew his stack?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.733
Come on.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.034
Maybe he's old-fashioned.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.136
Maybe he doesn't like
his wife to work.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.539
Tell me you never dreamed
about your teachers.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.007
Never.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.009
Look, everybody's got
a Miss Conway.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.011
Eighth grade
English teacher.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.413
A thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.548
And?

16:23.550 --> 16:24.515
Too old.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.417
Washed up at 23, huh?

16:26.419 --> 16:28.486
That's right,
my friend.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.422
S.A.T.s--

16:31.424 --> 16:32.523
verbal 650.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.425
Math 540.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.027
That's pretty good.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.161
Not for Yale.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.163
My dad's got this
Ivy thing.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.766
That's why Mrs. Kealey's
been helping me.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.768
Got to pick up the math.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.770
How often
you see her?

16:45.772 --> 16:47.138
Fourth period.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.374
Calculus--
Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays

16:49.376 --> 16:51.509
and tutoring--
Tuesdays and Thursdays

16:51.511 --> 16:52.510
during lunch.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.578
Ever at night?

16:53.580 --> 16:56.748
I don't like Ivy
that much.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.416
Ever have any social contact
with her?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.451
What do you mean, social?

17:00.453 --> 17:04.422
Means you ever go
to the soda fountain for a malt?

17:04.424 --> 17:06.157
She's my teacher.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.526
Are you saying
you wouldn't?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.429
I'm no Rob Lowe,
Detective.

17:11.431 --> 17:15.233
I have enough trouble
getting dates with juniors.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.435
Did you have a date
on the 22nd?

17:17.437 --> 17:20.304
How 'bout do you remember
where you were

17:20.306 --> 17:22.540
on the 22nd?

17:22.542 --> 17:26.577
Yeah, I remember where I was
when the Mets traded Darryl.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.080
I don't know October 22.

17:29.082 --> 17:32.216
Okay, let's try last Tuesday.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.618
Last Tuesday, sure.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.553
My dad drags me to the opera.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.788
Since I was a kid.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.589
Eight shows a season.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.224
Your dad have a car?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.626
No, he's a book editor.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.628
Takes the subway to work.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.229
PACK:
<i> Last Tuesday--</i>

17:45.231 --> 17:46.631
<i> La Boheme.</i>

17:46.633 --> 17:51.235
Not a wonderful production,
but yes, Roy was with me.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.238
The Tuesday night series--
pretty expensive, huh?

17:54.240 --> 17:57.108
Oh, don't let all this glamour
fool you, Detective.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.445
In the divorce, I got
the season tickets and the boy.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.547
It seems like
you feel

18:02.549 --> 18:04.115
you were short-changed.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.383
You two get along pretty well?

18:05.385 --> 18:07.552
He's a teenager.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.420
That school can't be cheap.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.521
That's his mother.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.157
She pays for it,
she picks it out.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.425
You don't approve?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.828
I'd prefer
he'd socialize with kids

18:16.830 --> 18:19.163
who were more concerned
with the classics

18:19.165 --> 18:20.298
than their lacrosse games.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.533
Does Mrs. Pack have a Mercedes?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.852
Could be.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.170
Has every other outrageously
expensive toy known to man.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.640
Costs more, must be better.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.478
It's the price
of owning your own company.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.546
Twice a month to Hong Kong.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.548
Sales meetings, lawyers,
accountants.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.151
Sometimes I forget
what it's all about.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.402
And what's that?

18:41.403 --> 18:42.652
Designing clothes.
It's a tough business.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.388
24 hours a day
and then some.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.858
So you don't spend
much time with Roy?

18:46.860 --> 18:48.126
We're divorced.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.627
Oh, you mean my son.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.862
Yeah.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.597
Biggest regret
of my life.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.565
I didn't even fight
for custody.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.534
Best interest of the child

18:56.536 --> 18:57.635
definitely
his father.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.238
I guess
you're too busy.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.572
I work.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.673
Is that a crime?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.175
Or are you

19:04.177 --> 19:07.445
the barefoot-in-the-kitchen
kind of guy?

19:07.447 --> 19:10.248
Do you own a Mercedes,
Mrs. Pack?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.450
Brand-new.
I bought it six months ago.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.584
Black?

19:13.586 --> 19:14.719
It's midnight blue.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.321
I use it
when clients come to town.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.656
Now what's this all about?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.558
In the best interest
of the child

19:20.560 --> 19:23.461
let's just hope
it looks brand-new.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.563
Last year she picked up
a new one.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.532
A Jag. Now a 560.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.201
I'm trying to convince her
to go Italian, you know.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.203
I could do with like
a Ferrari, you know.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.272
This is it right here.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.544
Must run you, what--
like 65 minimum, right?

19:41.714 --> 19:44.215
Bingo.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.220
Is this recent?

19:49.222 --> 19:52.223
He asked me
not to say anything.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.724
He?

19:53.726 --> 19:56.494
Yeah, the kid-- her son.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.963
He uses the car
when she's out of town.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.233
What about his alibi?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.435
<i>La Boheme.</i>
In by 8:00,
out by 11:00.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.204
Plenty of time
after the fat
lady sings.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.372
The guy was hit
at what, a quarter to 1:00?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.375
Yeah.
Still doesn't prove
he's involved with Jenna Kealey.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.544
Enough for her husband
to get bent out of shape.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.713
We got a witness
who I.D.'d the car.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.649
A garage attendant
who says he saw the Pack kid

20:18.651 --> 20:20.651
driving his mother's car of
same description that night.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.587
Now it has
a broken headlight.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.489
Forensics come up
with blood or fibers?

20:25.491 --> 20:27.859
Tomorrow earliest.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.228
Okay, so why didn't
he get the car fixed?

20:30.230 --> 20:32.230
Who's to say
he didn't try?

20:32.232 --> 20:33.965
Maybe mom got back from Hong
Kong earlier than expected.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.434
If we subpoena
the father's phone records

20:36.436 --> 20:38.436
I guarantee we find calls
to body shops.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.670
Come on, he's just a kid.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.539
Odds are we slap
the cuffs on him

20:41.541 --> 20:43.674
he's gonna be scared enough
to sing his own opera.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.611
Pick him up.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.414
Roy Pack, Junior,
you're under arrest

20:50.416 --> 20:51.749
for the murder
of Lawrence Kealey.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.985
You have the right
to remain silent.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.454
Anything you do say
will be used against you

20:56.456 --> 20:59.323
in a court of law, do
you understand that?
Step outside, please.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.662
Your Honor, my client
is 16 years old.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.631
He has never been charged
with any crime...

21:06.633 --> 21:09.867
This is a homicide,
Miss Rydell.

21:09.869 --> 21:10.835
Nevertheless,
the family court

21:10.836 --> 21:11.802
has concurrent
jurisdiction

21:11.804 --> 21:13.838
and the defendant
is entitled

21:13.840 --> 21:15.840
to be tried
as a juvenile.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.309
Pursuant to penal law,
section 210.43

21:18.311 --> 21:20.945
I move that this case
be remanded...

21:20.947 --> 21:22.613
I'm well aware of the statute,
Counselor.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.915
I'm also aware that
when the charge is murder two

21:24.917 --> 21:28.352
the district attorney
must consent to any removal.

21:28.354 --> 21:32.390
The people believe justice will
best be served if this court

21:32.392 --> 21:34.025
retains jurisdiction
Your Honor.

21:34.027 --> 21:35.393
So ordered.
Your motion is denied,

21:35.395 --> 21:36.961
Miss Rydell.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.697
Applications, Mr. Robinette?

21:39.699 --> 21:43.000
The people request bail
in the amount of $500,000.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.002
We're talking
about a teenager,
Your Honor.

21:45.004 --> 21:48.005
His father has no access
to that kind...

21:48.007 --> 21:50.408
Yes,
Miss Rydell,

21:50.409 --> 21:52.810
and I'm sure your firm is
working<i> pro bono</i> on this one.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.412
Bail is set

21:54.414 --> 21:56.380
at 200,000.

21:56.382 --> 22:00.051
For 62-plus a car, it should
be able to run into a wall.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.386
So the glass<i> is</i>
from a Mercedes.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.688
Could be.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.823
Could also be
from a BMW

22:05.825 --> 22:07.391
a VW, an Audi...

22:07.393 --> 22:09.026
Any blood or fibers?

22:09.028 --> 22:09.994
<i>Nada.</i>

22:09.996 --> 22:12.029
You think it
was hosed down?

22:12.031 --> 22:14.332
Yeah, or it rains,
broken hydrant...

22:14.334 --> 22:17.001
case last week--
a dog with a weak bladder.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.636
Great.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.639
Couple hours, I'll send you
a written report.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.741
STONE:
<i> We have a witness</i>
<i> who saw your client</i>

22:23.743 --> 22:25.343
driving a car
that matches

22:25.345 --> 22:27.945
the one that killed
Lawrence Kealey.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.014
Your client's car has
a broken headlight.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.749
Just like several
thousand others.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.752
Some kid has trouble
ripping off a radio

22:34.754 --> 22:37.455
gets ticked, kicks
in the headlight.
Proves nothing.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.057
Fibers from the victim's coat--

22:40.059 --> 22:42.093
that's a pretty good case,
isn't it?

22:42.095 --> 22:45.463
When the forensics report
arrives this afternoon

22:45.465 --> 22:50.134
hits my desk--
clock stops ticking.

22:57.777 --> 23:01.078
I don't believe you
planned this yourself, Roy.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.482
25 years in jail
is a long time

23:04.484 --> 23:06.384
for a little lust.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.752
It wasn't lust.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.958
I love her.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.159
Maybe you do.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.795
The question is,
does she love you?

23:17.797 --> 23:19.497
I don't see her running

23:19.499 --> 23:20.931
to your side.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.817
She will.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.702
She bought her apartment the day
after her husband was killed.

23:24.704 --> 23:27.938
Do you really think she cares
about anybody but herself?

23:31.177 --> 23:35.012
Man two, and he's sentenced
as a youthful offender.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.515
If we get Jenna Kealey in court.

23:46.926 --> 23:51.495
Her husband treated the dog
better than he treated Jenna.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.798
He was never there for her.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
He's the one who failed

23:55.802 --> 23:57.067
at everything.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.770
And everything was
always Jenna's fault.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.972
He made her feel like dirt.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.108
She started to believe it.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.577
So you killed him.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.512
He was suing her for divorce.

24:08.514 --> 24:10.748
She'd be left
with all his debts.

24:10.750 --> 24:14.885
And in this way,
she gets the insurance.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.992
And we'd be together.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.968
No blood, no fiber.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.003
Good for us the kid confessed.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.538
Bluffing's one thing.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.141
Ben, I told you there was
no blood or fiber.

24:37.143 --> 24:41.045
And I said the forensics report
would arrive this afternoon

24:41.047 --> 24:43.214
and here it is-- no lie.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.183
Right.

24:46.185 --> 24:49.854
I did the kid a favor,
and you know it.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.023
Youthful offender status
beats the hell out of
hard time at Attica.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.226
Now we got a shot
at the teacher.

24:55.228 --> 24:58.929
Accomplice testimony?
No help.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.233
Okay, we need corroboration
to charge Jenna.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.604
Larry's divorce lawyer.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.106
Now you're talking.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.043
You know, New York still
requires its parties

25:13.045 --> 25:15.513
to state grounds
with specificity.

25:15.515 --> 25:18.048
"I hate your guts"
isn't good enough,

25:18.050 --> 25:20.918
but it makes
for creative
lawyering.

25:20.920 --> 25:25.189
On nine out of ten,
I go for cruel and inhuman.

25:25.191 --> 25:28.526
You know,
it's easier
to fudge.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.928
"He kicks my dog."
"She burns my toast."

25:30.930 --> 25:33.531
Barbaric, but it's very good
for business.

25:33.533 --> 25:37.067
Ah, here-- "Kealey, Lawrence K."

25:37.069 --> 25:40.638
Did Jenna... burn his toast?

25:40.640 --> 25:43.307
That's, uh... privileged,
Counselor. You know that.

25:43.309 --> 25:46.176
You already served the complaint
on Jenna, Mr. Gerstein.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.145
It's lost its privilege.

25:50.082 --> 25:54.151
You want everything
or, uh, just the juicy parts?

25:55.221 --> 25:59.023
JENNA KEALEY:
<i>He's my student, Mr. Robinette,</i>

25:59.025 --> 26:01.158
period.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.095
And you always conduct
class in your bathtub?

26:05.097 --> 26:09.333
I just came from
your husband's attorney.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.268
Who's lying,
Mrs. Kealey?

26:13.205 --> 26:17.174
I was spending
a lot of time with Roy.

26:19.345 --> 26:22.613
It just happened.

26:22.615 --> 26:27.618
I ended it right after
Larry caught us together.

26:27.620 --> 26:31.622
A divorce would have
ruined you financially.

26:31.624 --> 26:35.092
Larry agreed to call off
the divorce.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.362
We were planning
a trip to Miami.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.698
We honeymooned there--

26:40.700 --> 26:42.700
like, starting over.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.204
We had our problems,

26:47.206 --> 26:50.207
but I loved Larry,
Mr. Robinette.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.610
I could never kill him.

26:52.612 --> 26:55.980
And Roy Pack?

26:55.982 --> 26:57.982
Roy wouldn't let go.

26:57.984 --> 27:01.285
He always thought
we could be together

27:01.287 --> 27:04.288
if Larry was out of the picture.

27:04.290 --> 27:09.126
Why didn't you
tell the police
about your affair?

27:09.128 --> 27:13.631
I am not proud of what I did.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.933
She called you
an obsessed puppy dog.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.002
She tried, but she
couldn't get rid of you.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.070
According to Mrs. Kealey,
you did it all alone.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.973
Without real evidence
to contradict that

27:22.975 --> 27:24.341
we can't even
touch her.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.210
I can't believe this!

27:32.118 --> 27:34.718
We tried to pay somebody
to do it.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.288
Who?

27:38.290 --> 27:39.423
Some guy... some guy

27:39.425 --> 27:42.092
who beat up her husband
last year.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.093
A bookie.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.361
You got a name?

27:44.363 --> 27:46.096
Yeah. David Kaufer.

27:46.098 --> 27:49.700
He said he'd take care
of everything for $2,000.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.368
We paid him in cash.

27:51.370 --> 27:54.204
He said it would be over
in two days.

27:54.206 --> 27:59.143
She gave him $2,000 in cash,
and her husband Larry
didn't know about that?

28:08.254 --> 28:09.987
I had these bonds.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.356
They were supposed
to be for college.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.124
You gave her
$2,000?

28:14.126 --> 28:15.292
I gave her ten.

28:17.096 --> 28:20.364
She said her husband
had run up her credit cards

28:20.366 --> 28:23.100
and that these people
were calling her.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.269
She said
she'd pay me back after.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.272
Mr. Kaufer corroborates,
we have a deal?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.711
A week after we paid him,
nothing.

28:33.713 --> 28:35.245
Jenna went crazy.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.716
Mr. Kaufer just laughed
in our faces.

28:38.718 --> 28:43.387
He said, "Well, thanks for
the money, but I'm no killer."

28:43.389 --> 28:47.157
So you did it yourselves.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.264
She said a hit-and-run.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.267
Nobody would ever find us.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.337
JENNA:
<i> The boy has</i>
<i> a vivid fantasy life.</i>

29:00.339 --> 29:02.439
If the police
find Mr. Kaufer

29:02.441 --> 29:05.075
and he as much
knows your name

29:05.077 --> 29:06.310
the fantasy's over.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.212
The reality is murder.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.180
The penalty
is 25 to life.

29:10.182 --> 29:13.417
Larry was going to leave me.

29:13.419 --> 29:17.121
I'd be left with nothing--

29:17.123 --> 29:19.056
less than nothing.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.291
He earned half
what I did.

29:21.293 --> 29:25.129
He divorces me,
I'd have to pay<i> him</i> alimony.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.164
So it was all
about money.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.184
Larry buried us.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.203
He falsified loan applications
and forced me to sign them.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.772
I have a real job.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.207
The banks came after me,
not him.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.777
Larry may have been
a bottom feeder,

29:39.779 --> 29:42.312
but not me.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.082
He owed me.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.317
Do you have a lawyer,
Mrs. Kealey?

29:47.319 --> 29:48.452
I did go

29:48.454 --> 29:50.187
to David Kaufer.

29:50.189 --> 29:53.924
It was a moment of madness
born out of necessity,

29:53.926 --> 29:55.325
but I woke up.

29:55.327 --> 29:58.495
I stopped him
before anything happened.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.198
I figured
I'd survive.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.933
I always did.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.501
And Roy?

30:04.503 --> 30:07.337
I told him
I couldn't see him anymore.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.939
Mrs. Kealey,

30:08.941 --> 30:12.242
I learned a long time ago
to come in out of the rain.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.878
You've lied to us
every step of the way.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.947
Why should we believe you now?

30:18.884 --> 30:21.418
Talk to that slime, Kaufer.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.823
He'll tell you
I am telling you the truth.

30:25.825 --> 30:30.227
And where do we find Mr. Kaufer?

30:30.229 --> 30:32.262
Hey, I'm a lover,
not a killer.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.531
I'm happy for you, Romeo.
You know, I bet there's

30:34.533 --> 30:37.501
a couple of guys up in
Attica that would just
love your company.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.136
I didn't do nothing.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.537
He have a record?

30:40.539 --> 30:41.538
Numbers, book.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.873
Nothing violent.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.408
Never heard of her.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.176
How about Roy Pack?

30:46.178 --> 30:49.146
Him neither.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.548
You know, Dave,
that's kind of strange

30:51.550 --> 30:54.151
because they've both
heard of you.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.186
I'll tell you what I'll do.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.888
I'll put you in a lineup

30:57.890 --> 31:01.892
and if either one of them
picks you out, you're toast.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.927
That's one
out of five.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.596
You like those odds?

31:05.598 --> 31:07.931
Yeah, all right, I know them.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.533
But I didn't kill nobody.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.401
I want immunity.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.171
I thought you
didn't do nothing.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.007
Look, she and the kid
came to see me, okay?

31:17.009 --> 31:19.509
Talked about popping
her old man.

31:19.511 --> 31:22.880
I heard it was more than talk.

31:22.882 --> 31:26.283
I heard she gave you two g's.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.885
Her hubby owed me four.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.186
King of the welchers--
real cantaloupe--

31:29.188 --> 31:31.989
couldn't pick a winner
in a one-horse race.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.424
So you took her money.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.293
What? You want
I should sue them?

31:36.295 --> 31:38.896
Hey, I'm not killing
nobody for no amount.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.197
Not my nature.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.999
I bet you're a real saint, Dave.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.634
Hey, I'm being
straight.

31:43.636 --> 31:45.435
This one's bonzo, anyhow.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.437
Comes back the next day,
wants her money back.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.406
Says she changed her mind.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.441
She's telling
the truth.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.011
Was the kid with her?

31:54.013 --> 31:56.446
Madder than hell.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.482
Broads.

31:58.484 --> 32:02.219
Can I go now, or what?

32:02.221 --> 32:03.620
She changed her mind, Adam.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.255
And you believe her?

32:05.257 --> 32:07.057
We got to. Kaufer
corroborated
her story.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.458
He did time.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.028
Rydell will have a field day
with him.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.963
And with the boy, you can bet

32:12.965 --> 32:14.965
that she'll play up
the obsession angle.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.034
She'll make him look
like he's only a victim

32:17.036 --> 32:19.036
of his teacher's
manipulation.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.704
Think she'll put him
on the stand?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.072
She has to.
He already confessed.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.942
Bring your crying towels,
boys.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.311
You should have included
manslaughter.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.947
Adam, that's why we didn't give
the jury an option.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.449
Without the manslaughter charge

32:32.451 --> 32:35.052
they cry hard enough, he walks.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.620
What about the girl?

32:36.622 --> 32:38.956
Nothing.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.291
She slept with the kid,
put murder in his head.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.994
She's as
responsible
as he is.
Of course she is.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.463
But we can't prosecute
for evil thoughts.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.597
Your Mrs. Kealey

32:47.599 --> 32:49.466
did more than think bad.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.035
She paid someone
to kill her husband.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.371
She also stopped.
Asking for the money back

32:54.373 --> 32:57.507
was the overt act necessary
to prove renunciation.

32:57.509 --> 33:01.511
The moment that Kaufer
took her money, it's conspiracy.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.980
She cannot renounce

33:02.982 --> 33:04.281
after the fact.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.383
For conspiracy
you need agreement.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.986
Jenna and Kaufer
never agreed on anything.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.121
He was ripping her
off, collecting on
her husband's marker.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.723
She conspired
with the boy...

33:12.725 --> 33:14.291
To hire a hit man

33:14.293 --> 33:15.726
to kill her husband.

33:15.728 --> 33:18.128
She aborted the plan;
Roy was left on his own.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.097
What about his deal?

33:20.099 --> 33:23.333
It went down the toilet
with his story.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.603
We have a deal, Stone.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.405
Wrong tense,
Counselor.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.708
In my office, two half-truths
do not equal a whole.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.678
And you'd better pray
that your client here

33:34.680 --> 33:36.713
is snowing you, too.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.115
Are you threatening me?

33:38.117 --> 33:40.017
As a matter of fact, yes, I am.

33:40.019 --> 33:43.053
I told the truth.

33:43.055 --> 33:45.022
Two witnesses
disagree.

33:45.024 --> 33:48.692
ROBINETTE:
Jenna Kealey told us
about her renunciation.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.694
David Kaufer confirmed

33:50.696 --> 33:52.863
her story.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.031
She put on the brakes,
so you went driving solo.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.666
You believe her?

33:56.668 --> 33:59.136
You shouldn't worry about me.
It's the jury

33:59.138 --> 34:00.737
you ought to be
worrying about.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.642
Oh, God...

34:05.644 --> 34:08.512
I can't believe this.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.119
She told me she loved me.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.362
KAUFER:
They were looking for someone
to kill Larry.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.431
She thought maybe I knew
someone.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.433
And she offered to pay you?

34:29.435 --> 34:31.435
Yeah, she and the kid both.

34:31.437 --> 34:32.803
She was scared, jumpy.

34:32.805 --> 34:34.104
I don't know.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.606
I told them
it would cost two grand.

34:36.608 --> 34:37.774
And they paid you?

34:37.776 --> 34:39.443
Came back that afternoon

34:39.445 --> 34:40.644
with the cash.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.112
To kill Lawrence Kealey?

34:42.114 --> 34:44.381
I never planned
on killing anybody.

34:44.383 --> 34:47.717
Her husband owed me the money--
last year's play-offs.

34:47.719 --> 34:51.388
I figured it was my only shot
at getting paid.

34:51.390 --> 34:54.458
STONE:
Was this the last
you saw of them?

34:54.460 --> 34:55.826
Came back the next day.

34:55.828 --> 34:57.828
This time she did
all the talking.

34:57.830 --> 35:00.430
Wanted to call
the whole thing off.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.865
Said she changed
her mind.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.501
STONE:
So you returned the money?

35:04.503 --> 35:06.736
I told you Larry owed me.

35:06.738 --> 35:14.744
Did the defendant, Roy Pack,
change his mind, as well?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.413
The kid was fuming.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.747
I'll tell you what.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.783
He was out for blood--

35:19.785 --> 35:20.884
yelling he'd do it himself.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.420
How did Mrs. Kealey react?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.422
She told him to grow up.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.224
Thank you. No further
questions, Your Honor.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.897
Where do you work, Mr. Kaufer?

35:33.899 --> 35:35.866
I'm self-employed.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.868
So you work out of your home?

35:37.870 --> 35:39.136
Yeah.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.837
Last year at this time

35:40.839 --> 35:43.240
were you working
out of your home?

35:43.242 --> 35:45.842
I was in prison.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.745
Upstate, in Ossining.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.714
What were the charges
against you?

35:52.417 --> 35:54.918
Selling stolen credit cards.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.721
And fraud?

36:01.193 --> 36:04.528
I wasn't running toward Roy.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.930
I was running away
from Larry.

36:06.932 --> 36:09.232
I wasn't looking for it.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.800
It just happened.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.802
What happened?

36:12.804 --> 36:16.439
We became lovers.

36:16.441 --> 36:20.744
It lasted for several months,
but I ended it.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.646
When did you end it?

36:22.648 --> 36:24.614
Right aft...

36:26.685 --> 36:30.820
Going to David Kaufer
was the low point in my life.

36:30.822 --> 36:34.858
It woke me up
to a lot of things.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.260
So you admit
to hiring David Kaufer

36:37.262 --> 36:38.828
to kill your husband?

36:38.830 --> 36:42.566
Was I supposed to spend
the rest of my life

36:42.568 --> 36:44.935
paying for Larry's mistakes?

36:44.937 --> 36:46.937
I panicked.

36:46.939 --> 36:50.807
I thought the insurance
was the only way out,

36:50.809 --> 36:53.810
but I couldn't go through
with it.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.313
I called off David Kaufer,

36:56.315 --> 36:58.615
and I ended it with Roy.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.517
How did the
defendant react

37:00.519 --> 37:02.852
when you called your affair off?

37:02.854 --> 37:04.955
He wouldn't accept it.

37:04.957 --> 37:08.558
He called me
at home constantly.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.260
If Larry answered, he hung up.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.829
He left letters in my mailbox
at school.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.764
I'd get up in the morning,

37:14.766 --> 37:17.867
he'd be outside
my apartment waiting.

37:17.869 --> 37:21.938
Roy thought it was Larry
who was standing between us.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.740
And it wasn't?

37:23.742 --> 37:28.545
He's just a boy.

37:36.622 --> 37:40.824
Did you ever tell Roy
that you loved him, Mrs. Kealey?

37:40.826 --> 37:42.292
No.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.561
But he told you,
didn't he?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.529
He didn't know what love was.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.298
Because he was only 16,

37:48.300 --> 37:51.568
and he thought
that sex was love,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.236
isn't that right?

37:53.237 --> 37:54.903
Your Honor, the witness is not
an expert in psychology.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.773
Sustained.

37:56.775 --> 38:00.944
The behavior exhibited by Roy
that you described on direct--

38:00.946 --> 38:03.580
would you call that obsessive?

38:03.582 --> 38:05.849
Not in the clinical sense--

38:05.851 --> 38:07.984
in the everyday use
of the word?

38:07.986 --> 38:08.985
I suppose.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.954
So you take away sex

38:10.956 --> 38:14.858
which to an obsessed teenager
translates to taking away love.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.961
Isn't it natural that
he would fight to get it back?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.930
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's testifying.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.899
He was 16, for God's sake.

38:22.901 --> 38:23.800
What do you expect...?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.869
Miss Rydell.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.676
STONE:
Redirect, Your Honor?

38:32.678 --> 38:35.578
Go ahead.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.048
Who first suggested

38:38.050 --> 38:41.084
killing your husband,
Mrs. Kealey?

38:41.086 --> 38:43.386
It was Roy.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.825
You saw where Rydell was going.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.960
You should have stopped
her cross completely.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.595
The more I object,

38:52.597 --> 38:54.597
the more it reinforces
her strategy,

38:54.599 --> 38:56.900
the more Roy
looks like a victim.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.803
But still, letting her play
the jurors' heartstrings...

38:59.805 --> 39:01.104
We knew it was coming.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.706
She's got nothing else.

39:02.708 --> 39:03.940
If they buy it,

39:03.942 --> 39:05.325
he walks.

39:05.326 --> 39:06.709
No manslaughter charges,
no safety net.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.346
The last I looked

39:09.348 --> 39:11.348
you were very adamant
about this.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.718
You knew that if we included
anything less than murder

39:14.720 --> 39:16.086
she'd pull out the sympathy

39:16.088 --> 39:18.722
and the jury would opt
for manslaughter.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.657
Ben, I agreed I didn't want to

39:20.659 --> 39:22.092
give the jury
that option; only...

39:22.094 --> 39:23.993
Only you looked
over the edge

39:23.995 --> 39:26.062
and you didn't like the view.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.798
I looked at the box.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.434
I didn't like the jurors' faces.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.772
<i> It's all he'd talk about.</i>

39:35.774 --> 39:37.006
Mrs. Kealey said this.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.875
Mrs. Kealey did that.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.877
He'd do anything for her

39:40.879 --> 39:42.846
like he was a puppet.

39:42.848 --> 39:43.813
Objection.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.382
Sustained.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.417
In the week before the murder

39:47.419 --> 39:50.387
did you observe any change
in Roy's behavior?

39:50.389 --> 39:57.160
One day he came home in a rage--
screaming, throwing his books.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.663
I tried to talk to him,
but, uh...

40:00.665 --> 40:03.133
he slammed his door in my face.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.769
Have you ever seen him
act this way before?

40:05.771 --> 40:10.039
When he was eight years old,
he had a fight with his mother.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.741
She told him

40:11.743 --> 40:13.977
that she was through with him

40:13.979 --> 40:16.913
that he was no longer her son.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.948
What did Roy do?

40:18.950 --> 40:20.917
He had a tantrum.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.786
He destroyed his room.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.188
He followed her around
everywhere she went

40:25.190 --> 40:28.691
crying, yelling.

40:28.693 --> 40:31.494
My wife thought she was
teaching him a lesson.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.695
So Roy's reaction

40:32.697 --> 40:34.464
to rejection
is violent behavior?

40:34.466 --> 40:36.166
STONE:
Your Honor, this is
totally irrelevant.

40:36.168 --> 40:37.934
I'll withdraw it.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.136
Nothing further, Your Honor.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.172
Sir, has your son

40:42.174 --> 40:44.073
ever been treated
by a psychiatrist?

40:44.075 --> 40:45.942
No.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.544
Why not?

40:47.546 --> 40:49.946
I never thought he was sick.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.015
Thank you.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.520
ROY:
Motels, sometimes.

40:57.522 --> 41:01.891
Mostly her apartment
during the day.

41:01.893 --> 41:08.064
A lot of Monday nights,
we would, um...

41:08.066 --> 41:11.000
rent videos

41:11.002 --> 41:13.937
and copy what they did
on the screen.

41:13.939 --> 41:16.539
And this went on for how long?

41:18.076 --> 41:21.077
Uh, six weeks, maybe.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.980
It's true,
isn't it, Roy,

41:23.982 --> 41:26.950
that prior to this
six-week sexual interlude

41:26.952 --> 41:28.184
you were a virgin?

41:28.186 --> 41:29.886
Your Honor?

41:29.888 --> 41:32.755
There's no way that this is
relevant, Miss Rydell.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.375
Objection sustained.

41:35.376 --> 41:37.994
Please tell us why your affair
with your teacher ended.

41:40.198 --> 41:43.032
Her husband came home once

41:43.034 --> 41:45.568
when I was there.

41:45.570 --> 41:49.506
He said he was going
to divorce her.

41:49.508 --> 41:52.108
Was it your idea to kill Larry?

41:52.110 --> 41:55.011
No, I said
she should just divorce him.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.013
I don't know why
she's lying now.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.214
When David Kaufer said
that he

41:58.216 --> 42:00.083
couldn't
take care of things for her,

42:00.085 --> 42:02.018
she said I was her last hope.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.853
Objection.
I didn't want
to do it.

42:03.855 --> 42:04.921
Sustained.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.824
Jury will disregard.

42:07.826 --> 42:11.561
RYDELL:
So why did you
listen to her?

42:19.538 --> 42:23.039
She told me
we could be together.

42:29.848 --> 42:33.583
She told me to be a man.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.989
No further questions.

42:39.991 --> 42:42.025
STONE:
<i> When I was in school</i>

42:42.027 --> 42:43.326
they taught the abc's.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.061
They've added
a "d" for depravity.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.830
And the fourth "r"
is renunciation.

42:47.832 --> 42:48.965
She's guilty as sin.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.934
But she didn't
break the law.

42:50.936 --> 42:51.968
Maybe she did.

42:51.970 --> 42:56.005
David Kaufer testified
that he kept Jenna's money

42:56.007 --> 42:58.274
because her husband
welched on a bet

42:58.276 --> 43:00.009
on last year's play-offs.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.612
If he was talking about
football or baseball

43:02.614 --> 43:04.247
he was in jail
during both.

43:04.249 --> 43:05.882
Kaufer might be lying.

43:05.884 --> 43:07.617
What's in it for him?

43:07.619 --> 43:09.218
Wrong question, Adam.

43:09.220 --> 43:11.654
Who's in it with him?

43:11.656 --> 43:13.890
Jenna?

43:15.961 --> 43:19.095
So it wasn't the play-offs.
It was the Stanley Cup.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.097
What can I say?
My memory's not so good.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.365
I remember perjury

43:22.367 --> 43:25.001
and I'm thinking conspiracy
to commit murder.

43:25.003 --> 43:30.039
I had nothing to do
with popping the guy.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.277
I want to deal.

43:34.279 --> 43:36.112
I'm not in the market.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.114
You want the woman?

43:38.116 --> 43:41.985
You help me
get her into court...

43:41.987 --> 43:45.188
No conspiracy charges?

43:48.059 --> 43:50.193
Fine.

43:52.998 --> 43:54.364
The two grand

43:54.366 --> 43:55.965
wasn't for a hit.

43:55.967 --> 43:59.202
I was just supposed to pretend
to be a hit man.

43:59.204 --> 44:02.005
She never hired you?

44:02.007 --> 44:04.007
I was just playing the role
for the kid.

44:04.009 --> 44:05.908
First you kill the hubby,
then you don't.

44:05.910 --> 44:08.711
So Roy's story's the truth.

44:08.713 --> 44:10.013
She squeezed the kid--

44:10.015 --> 44:11.014
real bad.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.016
Called him
all kinds of names.

44:13.018 --> 44:15.718
She said she
was just trying to scare him.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.286
It was all a con.

44:17.288 --> 44:21.224
I really didn't
want to know what
was going down.

44:21.226 --> 44:22.425
So, she never
renounced.

44:22.427 --> 44:24.127
Nothing to call off.

44:24.129 --> 44:26.429
When the cops
started getting close,

44:26.431 --> 44:29.065
she comes back to me
with this crazy story

44:29.067 --> 44:32.035
and another five g's.

44:40.979 --> 44:43.713
Jenna and Kaufer--
it was all an act

44:43.715 --> 44:46.349
perfectly staged to manipulate
Roy into committing murder.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.217
Are you sure about this, Ben?

44:48.219 --> 44:49.786
He was seduced twice.

44:49.788 --> 44:52.021
The renunciation was a scam--

44:52.023 --> 44:54.457
a safety net
in case she got caught.

44:54.459 --> 44:57.026
The truth is,
she did conspire with Roy.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.394
Two witnesses
perjuring themselves?

44:58.396 --> 45:00.029
It's an outrage.
I want sanctions.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.030
Calm down, Miss Rydell.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.332
You'll get your mistrial.

45:03.334 --> 45:05.168
No, I want a dismissal
of the charges

45:05.170 --> 45:06.803
against Roy, with prejudice.

45:06.804 --> 45:08.437
Now wait a minute, Counselor.
I don't see

45:08.438 --> 45:10.071
any harps or halos here.
Your client drove the car.

45:10.075 --> 45:12.341
Remember?
We cooperated with you
all the way, Ben.

45:12.343 --> 45:15.044
Roy didn't tell you
to believe the bitch.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.014
Nobody's disagreeing
with you, Janis.

45:18.016 --> 45:20.116
You got your original deal.

45:20.118 --> 45:23.152
Man two, sentenced
as a youthful offender.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.487
Fine.

45:24.489 --> 45:25.822
And the woman?

45:25.824 --> 45:30.126
I'm all for expedience,
Your Honor.

45:33.131 --> 45:35.798
This is a first.

45:57.088 --> 45:59.021
Jenna Kealey,
you're under arrest

45:59.023 --> 46:01.023
for the murder
of Lawrence Kealey.

46:01.025 --> 46:02.859
You have the right
to remain silent.

46:02.861 --> 46:05.261
If you choose
to waive that right

46:05.263 --> 46:06.829
anything you do say

46:06.831 --> 46:10.466
can be used against you
in a court of law.

46:14.139 --> 46:17.039
Education--
it's a wonderful thing.

46:17.041 --> 46:21.043
Anything worth
knowing cannot be
taught in a classroom.

46:21.045 --> 46:22.145
Oscar Wilde?

46:22.147 --> 46:23.546
Sister Mary Francis.

46:23.548 --> 46:25.782
She wielded a
hell of a paddle.
