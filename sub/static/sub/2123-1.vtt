00:21.840 --> 00:26.721
<i>The war between the states.
That's what Abner Beech called it.</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:28.649
<i>It had been going on for a year...</i>

00:28.840 --> 00:32.925
<i>before it really got to us in the
upper part of New York state.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:35.282
<i>We were far from the battles.</i>

00:35.440 --> 00:38.364
<i>At least, I thought we were.</i>

00:39.360 --> 00:44.764
<i>They called us people in the north that
didn't want the war "copperheads."</i>

00:45.760 --> 00:49.059
<i>I was just an orphan
living with the Beeches,</i>

00:49.085 --> 00:51.952
<i>but I was as big a
copperhead as Abner.</i>

00:53.040 --> 00:56.806
<i>Springtime, 1862.</i>

00:57.720 --> 01:00.246
<i>That's when the war came home.</i>

01:01.360 --> 01:05.046
<i>And nothing was ever
the same again.</i>

03:26.120 --> 03:28.248
They're recruiting in Juno Mills.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.767
What on earth for? The war is over.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.649
A confessed failure, if you ask me.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.201
You sound just like my pa.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.768
- Your father is afraid of a fight?
- Hell, no.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.445
Just don't like this war.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.289
Only time I saw Abner use
his fists on a fellow

03:43.315 --> 03:45.071
creature was when we
was starting school.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.890
- You remember that?
- Heh, oh, yeah.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.323
One of his hands cracks a stubborn
cow on the haunches with a shovel.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.723
Abner, boom, knocks the man
clear through the fence post.

03:55.960 --> 04:01.410
One day it's harsh as a blizzard,
the next, soft as sunshine.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.767
It's the equinoctial.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.485
The what?

04:06.680 --> 04:07.920
Equinoctial.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.368
You know what they say
down at the Corners.

04:13.560 --> 04:18.600
It's, uh, pretty hard to figure if the
war's gonna stop in the next few days...

04:18.760 --> 04:22.003
or go on for much worse than ever.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.604
Warner thinks we
need to join up now.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.048
Says if we wait any longer, we're
liable to miss the whole thing.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.486
What's there to miss?

04:33.640 --> 04:37.929
Defending your country, for starters.
Preserving the Union, for seconds.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.970
Who'll farm the land and do the
work if we all go off to war?

04:43.840 --> 04:45.285
Who invited you?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.320
Since when does Warner
Pitts need an invitation?

05:01.600 --> 05:07.084
Benjamin Wade, Republican
senator from Ohio, said:

05:07.280 --> 05:11.604
"Anyone who quotes the Constitution
in this crisis is a traitor."

05:11.760 --> 05:13.649
Traitor. The Constitution.

05:14.920 --> 05:19.323
Oh, oh. But listen how a Democrat paper
in Ohio gave it right back to them.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.849
"Such an abolitionist should be hung
till the flesh rots off his bones...

05:24.000 --> 05:27.482
and the winds of heaven whistle 'Yankee
Doodle' through his loathsome skeleton."

05:28.120 --> 05:29.326
King me, Paddy. Ha!

05:31.240 --> 05:33.322
Not listening to a word
I've been reading?

05:33.480 --> 05:36.245
Pa, I'm the checkers king.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.765
Whipped old Hurley here.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.208
We don't have kings in America.
Hurley will tell you that.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.641
No, but we got slaves.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.251
Jee Hagadorn getting
inside that head of yours?

05:56.400 --> 06:00.644
The way to a woman's heart, boy,
ain't by rejecting your own kin...

06:00.800 --> 06:03.690
and parroting the asinine
opinions of her father.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.283
How about a rollicking now, sis?

06:41.440 --> 06:45.240
There'll be no rollicking
in this house, Ni.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.808
I would be pleased to hear...

06:50.920 --> 06:54.766
"Am I Not a Man and Brother?"

06:54.920 --> 06:56.285
Whatever Father wants.

07:02.760 --> 07:08.608
<i>Am I not a man and a brother?</i>

07:09.080 --> 07:14.928
<i>Ought I not then to be free?</i>

07:15.120 --> 07:21.241
<i>Sell me not to one another</i>

07:21.400 --> 07:26.884
<i>Take not thus my liberty</i>

07:28.520 --> 07:35.449
<i>Ought I not then to be free?</i>

07:40.280 --> 07:41.645
Did I carry the tune?

07:42.280 --> 07:43.486
Carried the meaning.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.490
You're a blessing to me, Esther.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.644
You're a real blessing.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.528
You play like...

07:57.320 --> 07:58.481
Like an angel.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.484
Just like your mother did.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.001
Hmm.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.364
<i>The Camptown ladies
Sing this song, doo-da, doo-da</i>

08:21.560 --> 08:24.166
<i>Camptown ladies sing this song
Oh, de doo-da day</i>

08:24.320 --> 08:27.563
<i>Oh, de doo-da day
Oh, de doo-da day</i>

08:27.720 --> 08:29.848
<i>Camptown ladies sing this song
Oh, de doo-da day</i>

08:30.440 --> 08:31.521
Whoo!

08:34.080 --> 08:39.086
Thunder and lightning are the
judgments of divine will.

08:39.520 --> 08:45.448
To put a lightning rod atop a building, atop
a temple consecrated to the Almighty...

08:45.600 --> 08:48.206
is an act of insolent defiance.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.889
You cannot still the hand of God.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.520
You cannot silence the
booming artillery of heaven.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.884
Men know not whence
cometh the wind.

08:59.040 --> 09:05.764
We know only that the Lord rides the
storm, and he reaps the whirlwind.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.000
It's nothing but foolishness.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.884
"As lightning cometh from the
east and shineth in the west..."

09:11.040 --> 09:14.044
- "...so will be the coming of the Lord."
- Can you talk sense?

09:14.240 --> 09:16.481
A lightning rod will keep this
church from burning down.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.247
What the good Lord chooses
to burn, no man can prevent.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.085
Be it bush or temple.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.561
The Lord helps him
who helps himself.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.165
Jeff.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.204
Esther.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.450
And so we are justly proud that it was
a York state man, Charles Rand...

09:48.600 --> 09:52.844
who was the first to answer President
Lincoln's call for volunteers.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.971
A little chalk dust is nothing compared
to the smoke of the Battle of Shiloh.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.608
While some men frolic...

10:14.800 --> 10:19.601
others are trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.411
An apple for the teacher.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.763
"A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

11:01.920 --> 11:03.490
Who said that?

11:03.680 --> 11:04.841
William Shakespeare.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.765
- Father would have known that...
- Esther.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.002
Now, there's a beautiful name.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.846
This may sound silly to you,
but it's your name.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.240
That's the matter.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.727
- Beech?
- No. Jeff.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.528
I just... I don't like saying it.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.007
Why?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.567
It's the name of the
president of the rebellion.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.850
- A traitor.
- But it's my name too.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.520
Middle name, anyways.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.528
Thomas Jefferson Beech.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.287
I was born with it before Jeff
Davis ever whistled "Dixie."

11:39.920 --> 11:40.967
I know, it's just...

11:42.120 --> 11:45.203
- Your first name is so much nicer.
- Thomas?

11:46.720 --> 11:48.210
Let's just make it Tom.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.722
Then call me Tom.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.047
Tom.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.561
Jeff.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.282
Start the potatoes tomorrow.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.000
Who you talking to?

12:26.080 --> 12:28.481
Don't see any other
Jeffs hereabouts.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.002
You don't see one here neither.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.366
I ain't Jeff no more.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.925
Name's Tom.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.650
Jeff is Jeff Davis.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.529
I don't want no traitor name.

12:37.680 --> 12:41.002
You're named after Thomas
Jefferson, you idiot. Is he a traitor?

12:41.160 --> 12:42.924
Heh, no.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.809
He's a slaver, though, wasn't he?

12:45.560 --> 12:48.450
He wrote the Declaration
of Independence, you fool.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.171
I don't imagine his slaves
was too independent.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.281
Whatever you call yourself, you and Jimmy
are starting the potatoes tomorrow.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.771
Or can't we call him Jimmy?

12:58.280 --> 13:01.363
I don't know. Who'd your
parents name you for?

13:01.520 --> 13:03.841
Likely, Jimmy Madison.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.441
Is that okay with the Hagadorns?

13:29.880 --> 13:30.927
Oh, yeah.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.645
Whoa!

13:49.840 --> 13:52.081
Whoa!

14:00.960 --> 14:02.610
Whoa!

14:21.360 --> 14:23.966
Come on now, Ray. You can't
be sitting in the shadows.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.202
Keep not thy talents hid. Come on.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.249
Byron's right.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.323
Up you go.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.443
- Care for a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.770
Ladies and gentlemen, hearken
to the voice of an angel...

14:36.920 --> 14:38.763
set down on this earth.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.288
Mr. Ray Hare.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.443
Esther Hagadorn, eh?

14:47.200 --> 14:52.240
Her father's crazier than a shithouse
rat, but she's a prize, Jeff.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.401
She's a true prize.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.286
Just remember:

14:56.440 --> 15:01.287
"Always to court and never to wed is
the heaviest life that ever was led."

15:02.400 --> 15:09.409
<i>Has it feet like water lilies?</i>

15:09.880 --> 15:16.809
<i>Has it feathers like a bird?</i>

15:17.440 --> 15:18.805
<i>Is it brought</i>

15:18.960 --> 15:25.047
<i>From famous countries</i>

15:25.200 --> 15:32.243
<i>Of which I have never heard?</i>

15:33.080 --> 15:40.680
<i>Morning</i>

15:40.840 --> 15:47.883
<i>Bright shining of the sun</i>

15:48.440 --> 15:55.847
<i>Morning</i>

15:56.240 --> 16:03.249
<i>Will the morning ever</i>

16:13.800 --> 16:16.451
<i>Will the morning</i>

16:16.600 --> 16:23.006
<i>Ever come?</i>

16:36.800 --> 16:38.290
Abner.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.050
Morning, Abner.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.451
Thanks. All right.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.326
Tabitha.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.130
Abner.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.965
Hmm.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.443
This from you?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.681
Good deal of sense in this.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.805
But if I have something
to say, I say it direct.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.442
I've always respected you, Abner.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.324
I still do.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.962
But I don't want to see politics
tear our community apart.

18:51.120 --> 18:51.769
Already has.

18:51.795 --> 18:54.388
It's Democrats who rend
this country asunder.

18:54.520 --> 18:58.923
It's Abraham Lincoln and his Republicans
tearing us apart, and the Constitution.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.880
Closing down newspapers,
putting critics in prison.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.963
Enlisting mere boys...

19:05.160 --> 19:07.811
to fight in his
unconstitutional war.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.002
What would you have
President Lincoln do?

19:10.160 --> 19:12.208
The rebs fired first. Fort Sumter.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.409
Should've let the South go.
They'd have not harmed us.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.005
Not harmed us?

19:17.160 --> 19:19.083
Hell, they've split
the Union in two.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.005
Just so they could keep
black men in bondage.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.209
I am not a slaver. I've
never even seen a slave.

19:26.360 --> 19:30.365
But the Constitution says it's none of
York state's business what Dixie does.

19:30.560 --> 19:34.531
Those slave-ocrats, they're not
satisfied with their little corner.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.207
They want to expand into
Kansas, into Nebraska...

19:38.400 --> 19:39.606
into New Mexico.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.089
Good Lord, they want
us to steal Cuba too.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.204
How does that fit your
beloved Constitution?

19:48.200 --> 19:49.645
I'm no party man.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.370
I'm no expansionist neither.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.966
I don't want Cuba. Hell,
I didn't even want Texas.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.011
But I do not want our boys dying.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.531
And I don't want the
Constitution dying with them.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.882
The Union, Abner.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.611
Doesn't the Union
mean anything to you?

20:08.760 --> 20:10.888
It means something.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.488
It means more than something.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.401
But it doesn't mean everything.

20:17.840 --> 20:21.287
My family means more
to me. My farm.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.370
The Corners means more.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.046
York state means more to me.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.847
And though we disagree, Avery...

20:30.360 --> 20:33.887
you mean more to me than any Union.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.930
Good day to you.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.809
Good day, Abner.

20:51.280 --> 20:56.081
<i>Mid toil and tribulation</i>

20:56.240 --> 20:59.449
<i>And tumult of her war</i>

21:00.680 --> 21:05.811
<i>She waits the consummation</i>

21:05.960 --> 21:09.282
<i>Of peace forevermore</i>

21:10.280 --> 21:15.161
<i>Till with the vision glorious</i>

21:15.320 --> 21:19.769
<i>Her longing eyes are blessed</i>

21:20.200 --> 21:25.001
<i>And the great church victorious</i>

21:25.160 --> 21:30.963
<i>Shall be the church at rest</i>

21:31.680 --> 21:38.689
<i>Amen</i>

21:54.160 --> 21:56.322
The prophet saw...

21:56.480 --> 21:58.801
rising out of the sea...

21:59.000 --> 22:02.402
a beast with seven heads...

22:02.560 --> 22:04.483
and 10 horns.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.527
On its horns were 10 diadems...

22:07.720 --> 22:11.964
and on its head were
blasphemous names.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.367
This beast uttered proud boasts...

22:15.560 --> 22:18.245
and the people cowered
in fear asking:

22:18.440 --> 22:23.162
"Who can compare with the beast
or who can fight against it?"

22:25.040 --> 22:27.520
I wonder at the names...

22:27.680 --> 22:31.207
of those seven heads.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.571
Could they be Stephen Douglas...

22:37.120 --> 22:38.360
James Buchanan...

22:41.560 --> 22:44.803
John C. Calhoun...

22:45.080 --> 22:48.721
Lewis Cass...

22:50.440 --> 22:52.727
John Breckinridge...

22:54.360 --> 22:56.601
Franklin Pierce...

22:59.120 --> 23:01.248
Horatio Seymour?

23:15.720 --> 23:17.563
Blessed are the peacemakers.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.122
Is that still in the Bible?

24:15.280 --> 24:17.282
Yeah, not so fast with
those cans, Hurley.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.681
From now on, I want
to see measurements.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.161
- Measurements?
- Measurements.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.802
There's talk of certain
people watering their milk.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.849
You want to see measurements.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.970
Watering milk? What the
hell are you talking about?

24:32.960 --> 24:35.281
You ain't never done this before.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.250
Abner Beech started this cheese
factory. He's an honest man.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.768
- He wouldn't cheat the devil himself.
- So you say.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.806
Abner Beech gave you the
land for this factory.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.809
Water his milk?

24:50.680 --> 24:51.761
You're not worth it.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.366
Bastards.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.206
You take the milk
down to Juno Mills...

25:04.360 --> 25:08.160
and if they give you any trouble about
it, ask for Will Bishop and he'll vouch.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.570
Go on.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.406
Thank you.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.729
So, what's the verse
for today, Father?

25:46.880 --> 25:51.044
Ah. Brother will betray
brother unto death...

25:51.200 --> 25:53.441
and the father, his child.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.286
Children will rebel
against their parents...

25:57.440 --> 25:59.602
and have them put to death.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.609
Mark 13, either verse 11 or 12.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.001
I can't quite remember.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.243
Ni and I have no plans to
put you to death, Father.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.610
Just say you won't marry him.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.604
And why would I marry Tom Beech?

26:26.560 --> 26:28.927
I see the way you look at him.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.287
He at you.

26:31.080 --> 26:35.130
I'm a blind pilgrim in
this world, but even I...

26:36.640 --> 26:39.644
can see when a boy sparks a girl.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.361
Dear Father, sparks don't
always lead to a fire.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.362
If you marry him...

26:55.120 --> 26:57.600
well, you will kill me.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.211
Ah!

28:54.840 --> 28:56.968
You ain't a bit well, Abner.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.726
I'm likely as well as
I'm ever to be again.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.890
Has any more of them been
saying or doing anything?

29:03.040 --> 29:06.089
You think I care a picayune
what they say or do?

29:06.240 --> 29:07.651
They won't take my timber.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.644
Accuse me of watering milk
in the factory I started.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.246
That's what happens when you
tear up the Constitution.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.971
Contracts no good.
Charters don't count.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.851
Man's own kids and kin
turn against him.

29:19.560 --> 29:24.282
- Where is Jeff?
- Fishing. He went off about 2:00.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.364
They say they're biting like
anything down in the creek.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.524
Well, stick to your work
and they won't bite you.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.771
Sons. They make their own way.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.446
Where do you think Jeff
was last night? Hmm?

29:37.600 --> 29:39.682
Where do you think he
is right this minute?

29:39.880 --> 29:43.601
Fishing? Ha! He's down to the
schoolhouse with the Hagadorn girl.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.566
The only thing Jeff's ever been
studious about is that teacher.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.125
Daughter of Jee Hagadorn.

29:51.320 --> 29:54.130
The child of that whining,
backbiting scoundrel.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.681
Been eating his way into
me like a deer tick.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.890
I'd not be surprised if he's behind every
mean and miserable thing that's happened.

30:01.160 --> 30:05.245
And naturally, it's his
daughter Jeff takes a shine to.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.801
It was you that got her
the job teaching school.

30:07.960 --> 30:11.601
Well, that hasn't
anything to do with it.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.047
Ah. I'm not blaming her.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.804
She's a good gal, as far as I know.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.889
Quality, like her mother.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.206
The world is turning
upside down, M'rye.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.442
At least the Corners is.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.367
Lies taken for truth...

30:25.520 --> 30:28.410
my neighbors turning against me.
Now my son, my only son.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.009
- Maybe if you speak to Jeff...
- Oh, I'll speak to him, all right.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.889
I'll speak to him so he hears me.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.089
Boy, you run down the creek
road and see can you find Jeff.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.523
If he's not around the schoolhouse,
he'll be around the Hagadorns'.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.684
Tell him get back here now. And
you needn't tell him what about.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.162
Go on, pick up your feet.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.484
Thank you, dear.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.211
Whoa!

31:18.360 --> 31:19.930
You want a lift?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.885
Get in. I ain't gonna bite.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.689
You seen Jeff?

31:34.480 --> 31:37.324
Can't call him Jeff no more.
You have to call him Tom.

31:37.480 --> 31:40.723
I suppose your pa put him up to it.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.327
Maybe so, maybe no.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.721
Pa is funny on names.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.641
He's mortified I don't up and kill people
on account of my name being Benaiah.

31:50.920 --> 31:55.050
He says to me, "Boy, here I named you
after David's General Benaiah..."

31:55.200 --> 31:57.931
who killed him an 8-foot
Egyptian giant...

31:58.080 --> 32:00.731
and instead of making ready
to kill the enemies...

32:00.880 --> 32:04.009
all you do is read dime novels
and cut up monkeyshines.

32:04.960 --> 32:09.045
"Should have named you Pete or
Steve or William Henry." Heh.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.447
That's what I get every day.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.206
Last time he went after
me for "Benaiah," I said:

32:15.360 --> 32:19.922
"Now, look here, patriarchs in glass
houses mustn't heave stones."

32:20.320 --> 32:23.563
You're named after Jehoiada. In the
Bible he made a covenant with God.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.609
I ain't never seen you
make no covenant.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.250
"All you do is make barrels."

32:27.400 --> 32:29.129
Well, what did he say?

32:29.280 --> 32:31.760
I left before he said anything.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.447
Abner wants you to come
right straight home.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.365
Pa send you to say that?

33:39.880 --> 33:42.486
There ain't nothing the
matter at the farm?

33:43.360 --> 33:45.283
He don't want me for
nothing special?

33:45.440 --> 33:48.444
He didn't say. He just
said he wanted you home.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.364
Tell Pa I ain't coming.

34:01.960 --> 34:04.566
Tell the old man and Ma I'm
going to enlist in the Army.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.725
If they want to say goodbye,
they can send word...

34:17.199 --> 34:18.565
I'll manage to slip back.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.922
If they ain't willing...

34:21.760 --> 34:23.649
they needn't send word.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.760
- Tom, don't you think...?
- His name's Jeff.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.440
You oughtn't leave them like that.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.764
Bye, boy.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.242
You'll empty out the
creek with that pole.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.772
Jeff says he's going
to join the Army

35:19.798 --> 35:22.468
and if you want to say goodbye,
you're to let him know.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.844
That's what he said.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.570
You'd better go around
and get your supper.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.524
Gentlemen.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.810
Be safe.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.965
Troops, fall in behind the
band in force. Quickly.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.242
By the way he marched so proudly...

39:49.400 --> 39:53.849
you'd have thought Warner Pitts
was God's gift to the Union Army.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.241
- The big coward.
- He is not.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.890
I thought he looked smart.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.127
Brave and smart.

39:59.280 --> 40:03.001
I think he just wanted to get out of
town before your tummy started showing.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.650
Ha-ha-ha.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.929
Well, it's an ill wind
that blows nobody good.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.242
I could eat a horse
and chase its rider.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.165
What does Mr. Beech say of
Jeff running off to the Army?

40:13.320 --> 40:14.401
He don't say nothing.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.966
Jeff is as good as dead.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.831
Don't matter if he wins
the war all by hisself.

40:19.857 --> 40:21.833
Mr. Beech ain't got a son no more.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.081
Except Jimmy.

40:23.760 --> 40:24.841
You're the new son.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.758
Long as he stays
clear of Hagadorns.

40:26.784 --> 40:28.746
Ain't no other Hagadorn
girls besides Esther.

40:30.160 --> 40:35.087
You ain't gonna steal Esther while
Jeff's at the war, are you, Jimmy?

40:35.960 --> 40:37.928
Till's got no man now
that Warner's gone.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.442
Well, once upon a time,
Till was pure as the snow. Heh.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.090
But she drifted.

40:43.240 --> 40:47.450
She's a little long in the tooth for you,
but a desperate woman ain't choosy.

40:48.840 --> 40:53.004
Don't let these hussies taunt you. Wouldn't
know a real man if he fell from the sky.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.970
Mm-hm.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.953
Soon it'd be time for the
husking bee, won't it?

42:30.979 --> 42:32.187
No husking bee for us.

42:32.360 --> 42:35.887
Husking bee for everybody
else, but not for us.

42:37.080 --> 42:40.880
You recall when we set up a ring of big
pumpkins over at the Seymours' place?

42:41.040 --> 42:44.726
And we all sat on them under the moonlight
and Lem Hornbeck played his fiddle?

42:44.880 --> 42:47.281
We all danced and danced
and sang all the night?

42:47.440 --> 42:48.646
Yes, I do.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.530
I like the husking bees
later in the year.

42:54.680 --> 42:58.048
The cider and the
pumpkin pies, big fire.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.601
I know many a husband and
wife that started at a bee.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.450
All the men are going off to war.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.928
Ain't no one left for bees
except Jimmy and copperheads.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.921
Even if we was to be invited, which we
in this household ain't likely to be...

43:10.080 --> 43:12.924
Stop it. Enough about husking bees.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.684
No husking bees this year.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.491
None. Back to work.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.994
Janey, bring some taters
from the root cellar.

43:25.020 --> 43:25.634
Yes, ma'am.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.004
Ain't it funny how Jeff calls
this our underground rail road?

43:38.160 --> 43:42.449
He says ain't nobody had ever expect Mr.
Beech hiding runaways in our root cellar.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.927
Railroad don't stop here, Janey.

44:47.360 --> 44:50.364
<i>The road to sweet Athy,
hurroo, hurroo</i>

44:50.520 --> 44:54.206
<i>While goin' the road to sweet Athy
Hurroo, hurroo</i>

44:54.360 --> 44:56.203
<i>While goin' the road to sweet Athy</i>

44:56.360 --> 44:59.284
<i>A stick in me hand,
a drop in me eye</i>

44:59.440 --> 45:03.047
<i>A doleful damsel I did spy</i>

45:03.200 --> 45:05.487
<i>And, Johnny, I hardly knew ye</i>

45:05.680 --> 45:07.205
Listen, Paddy.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.885
This ain't no time for singing.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.121
Ain't you heard?

45:10.280 --> 45:12.886
Twenty thousand dead in a
place called Antietam.

45:14.200 --> 45:17.090
- And where would that be now?
- Maryland.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.562
Where you and your kind
would be more welcomed.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.804
My kind?

45:29.400 --> 45:32.529
- I'm as American as you.
- Then why ain't you fighting at Antietam...

45:32.680 --> 45:36.844
- ...instead of scrounging liquor around here?
- Because I don't fight for no Abe Lincoln.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.405
Nor for any blasted Union.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.480
- I'm a Democrat.
- You're a copperhead.

45:52.080 --> 45:53.411
Yeah, that's right.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.840
Slither away, copperhead.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.447
Crawl all the way back to Virginia
where you belong. Get on.

46:03.560 --> 46:05.324
What was that about?

46:06.760 --> 46:11.482
Some of these local boys ain't been reading
the same books we have in Abner's library.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.529
Abolitionists.

46:13.760 --> 46:17.526
"Fight, fight, fight," that's
their answer to everything.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.805
At least Hagadorn
stands on principle.

46:21.840 --> 46:26.004
A shouting Methodist, a temperance
fanatic, a damned abolitionist...

46:26.160 --> 46:29.403
but he stands on principle.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.449
I gotta give him that.

46:31.640 --> 46:35.565
Ten years ago, an abolitionist wouldn't
get arrested in Dearborn County.

46:36.120 --> 46:39.647
Oh, yeah, an abolitionist would
get arrested in Dearborn County.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.643
Jee Hagadorn was the only one.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.723
And he was a lonely one.

46:44.240 --> 46:48.723
County gave Frank Pierce the vote in
'52, Jimmy Buchanan the vote in '56.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.202
And then we turn around, we
vote Abe Lincoln in '60.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.204
Hagadorn won.

46:55.360 --> 46:59.445
And the thing is, he's still
the same jackass he ever was.

47:02.640 --> 47:05.405
Guess I'll hop off
and walk a spell.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.809
Suit yourself.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.930
Just gonna find out if
they heard anything more.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.401
Anything about Jeff.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.164
I'll just look in and see and
then I can cut home across lots.

47:21.560 --> 47:23.449
Whoa.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.529
Whoa, boy, whoa.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.968
Tch-tch! Hup.

47:37.160 --> 47:40.528
<i>No one to love</i>

47:40.680 --> 47:44.048
<i>No one to love</i>

47:44.200 --> 47:50.731
<i>Why no one to love?</i>

47:51.080 --> 47:57.042
<i>What have you done
in this beautiful world</i>

47:57.200 --> 47:59.328
<i>That you're sighing</i>

47:59.520 --> 48:04.924
<i>Of no one to love?</i>

48:08.160 --> 48:10.401
Jimmy, I didn't know you were here.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.561
Are you hungry?

48:11.720 --> 48:14.883
I've roasted an ear of corn but
it's the worst kind of failure.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.805
I've watched Ni do it a
hundred times, but with me...

48:17.960 --> 48:21.567
it always comes out
scorched and smoky.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.566
It's tougher than a
pharaoh's heart.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.009
Here, try a bit.
See what you think.

48:35.440 --> 48:40.162
I came to see if you heard
anything, any news.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.001
About Tom?

48:43.160 --> 48:44.605
About Jeff.

48:45.480 --> 48:50.691
No. All we know is that the
brigade his regiment was in lost.

48:50.840 --> 48:57.769
One hundred and forty-one killed,
560 wounded and 38 missing.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.649
That's all.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.089
That's all.

49:20.040 --> 49:24.967
<i>Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord</i>

49:25.120 --> 49:29.045
<i>He is trampling at the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored</i>

49:29.200 --> 49:31.487
<i>He hath loosed the
fateful lightning</i>

49:31.640 --> 49:34.086
<i>With his terrible swift sword</i>

49:34.280 --> 49:37.204
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

49:37.360 --> 49:41.809
- Has word come? Have you heard? Is he safe?
- The day has come. Yeah.

49:41.960 --> 49:45.009
But Tom. Tom. You've seen
his name. He's safe.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.243
Tom?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.843
Tom.

49:55.120 --> 49:57.361
Perish a hundred Toms.

49:57.520 --> 50:03.163
Yea! Ten thousand Toms
on one such day as this.

50:03.320 --> 50:08.247
Pray with me, child, for the Scarlet
Woman of Babylon is overthrown...

50:08.440 --> 50:13.128
and bound with chains,
and cast into a lake of fire.

50:13.320 --> 50:17.370
In one day shall all her plagues come,
death and mourning and famine...

50:17.520 --> 50:19.443
and she shall be utterly burned.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.766
But the list. You've seen the
list? You've seen his name?

50:22.920 --> 50:25.127
I didn't see!

50:27.680 --> 50:30.729
Oh, Child...

50:30.920 --> 50:36.290
Lincoln has signed a
proclamation freeing the slaves.

50:38.200 --> 50:40.328
My child.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.083
What should I care...

50:49.240 --> 50:56.283
for all your Toms and
Dicks and Harrys...

50:56.440 --> 50:59.762
on such a day as this?

51:04.400 --> 51:07.722
Woe is the great city of Babylon...

51:07.880 --> 51:10.121
the strong city...

51:10.280 --> 51:14.444
for in one hour is
thy judgment come.

51:15.200 --> 51:18.647
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

51:18.840 --> 51:20.126
<i>Glory, glory...</i>

52:36.000 --> 52:38.844
Can't believe Ray Hare is dead.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.322
Simpleminded, but,
oh, could he sing.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.844
Tenderhearted too.
Wouldn't hurt a fly.

52:46.160 --> 52:48.481
Not a good quality in
a soldier, I suspect.

52:48.680 --> 52:52.844
Still, the nicest kid
you'd ever wanna know.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.049
Yeah, but he sang for
that old copperhead.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.806
- Maybe it was the Lord's idea of justice.
- Nonsense.

52:58.960 --> 53:02.169
Abner Beech is a stiff-backed old
mule, but he ain't the devil.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.840
I surely hope it ain't a
judgment on poor Ray.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.209
I've hired out in season to the
Beeches for two years now.

53:08.800 --> 53:12.282
Not bad people,
but awful copperheadish.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.848
What's Abner say about
his son missing?

53:16.240 --> 53:17.480
He won't talk about it.

53:17.640 --> 53:19.847
It's like Jeff never lived.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.570
It ain't natural.

53:21.760 --> 53:27.369
- You reckon that orphan took Jeff's place?
- Jimmy is like a son, but Jeff is a son.

53:28.360 --> 53:31.887
- What does this "missing" mean anyway?
- Means taken prisoner.

53:32.040 --> 53:35.203
Ah. Rebs don't take no prisoners.

53:35.360 --> 53:38.011
They catch them, they shoot them.

53:38.160 --> 53:41.687
Well, you all can ask Warner
Pitts when he comes home.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.080
Wounded in action.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.691
A hero, I hear.

53:44.840 --> 53:46.729
Warner Pitts? Hero?

53:47.400 --> 53:48.561
Sure.

53:48.720 --> 53:51.371
A hero of many a
well-fought bottle.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.404
Warner.

54:38.400 --> 54:41.961
So, Warner, how come they
ain't made you general yet?

54:42.560 --> 54:44.642
In due time, Lambert, in due time.

54:45.320 --> 54:48.802
First, let this old leg heal, then
I'll be busy as a fiddler's elbow...

54:48.960 --> 54:53.887
trampling out every copperhead snake
and secret reb from here to Ohio.

54:54.680 --> 54:56.284
What about the missing?

54:56.440 --> 54:59.125
They say Jeff Beech and
Byron Truax is missing.

54:59.280 --> 55:02.568
- What do you expect happened to them?
- Can't say I know.

55:03.760 --> 55:06.366
We were part of Hooker's line.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.441
All the boys from the Corners.

55:10.240 --> 55:13.323
We were moving through a cornfield,
seemed like 10 feet high.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.449
When we came to a clearing, the rebs
met us with cannons and muskets...

55:18.600 --> 55:20.523
and the fury of hell.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.251
Half of us fell dead or wounded.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.483
The other half hightailed
it back into the high corn.

55:28.160 --> 55:29.525
Which did you do, Warner?

55:31.000 --> 55:33.241
I got hit in the leg.

55:33.640 --> 55:38.043
Mini ball. Worst kind of hit you can take.
That knocked me ass over teakettle.

55:38.200 --> 55:41.522
Just a flesh wound, but
it smarted like hell.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.803
I looked over...

55:45.240 --> 55:48.084
and I seen Ray Hare
lying on the ground.

55:49.080 --> 55:52.163
"Ray," I says, "you okay?"

55:53.240 --> 55:54.401
Didn't move.

55:56.480 --> 55:57.766
Crept over to him.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.841
My hand to his shoulder.

56:04.040 --> 56:07.886
And then I seen a big hole
where his eye used to be.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.646
I got away after a while...

56:19.000 --> 56:21.571
hooked up with a
Michigan regiment...

56:21.720 --> 56:25.167
but I lost track of the boys.

56:25.760 --> 56:29.810
Don't know what became of
Jeff or Byron, Elijah or Anson.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.642
Maybe they died in the cornfield. Maybe
they got captured. Maybe they ran.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.245
I don't...

56:37.400 --> 56:39.050
I don't know.

56:40.760 --> 56:43.240
I just do not know.

56:47.160 --> 56:48.810
Treason.

56:49.600 --> 56:52.922
It was treason, I tell you.

56:53.880 --> 56:56.645
Treachery and treason.

56:57.120 --> 57:02.684
We had the rebels right where we wanted
them, but those traitors in Washington...

57:02.840 --> 57:06.845
they let them cross over the
Potomac in their own sweet time.

57:07.600 --> 57:08.761
McClellan.

57:09.440 --> 57:15.163
He ain't good enough to hang from
the sourest crab apple tree.

57:15.320 --> 57:17.004
- Go, Jee, give them hell.
- Huh?

57:17.200 --> 57:20.170
- Hanging's too good for them.
- Too good indeed. McClellan...

57:21.600 --> 57:25.764
and those infernal Union
generals ought to be cast...

57:27.480 --> 57:29.608
into the eternal fire.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.441
Burn them all.

57:33.640 --> 57:37.281
Burn them.

57:40.360 --> 57:43.967
Did you pay for those
raisins, Mr. Abolition?

57:44.120 --> 57:46.771
Or do you intend to emancipate
them from our store...

57:46.920 --> 57:49.651
the way you'd
emancipate the slaves?

57:49.800 --> 57:55.330
Oh, Mrs. Watkins. What do you
care about the poor bondsman?

57:56.120 --> 58:00.170
You and your Susan B. Anthony.

58:00.760 --> 58:03.081
Rights for women?

58:03.240 --> 58:05.242
Women.

58:05.800 --> 58:11.364
That's nothing more than strumpets preaching
the heretical doctrine of free love.

58:11.520 --> 58:15.730
I don't know if Mrs. Watkins
holds with free love, Hagadorn.

58:16.360 --> 58:19.011
But she sure don't
believe in a free lunch.

58:36.320 --> 58:38.607
A little rain.

58:40.600 --> 58:43.331
What do I do with him, Lord?

58:44.040 --> 58:46.168
What do I do with him?

58:47.520 --> 58:49.488
You winning the argument
with yourself, Pa?

58:49.640 --> 58:52.928
Why weren't you there,
boy? At Watkins?

58:53.200 --> 58:54.645
Huh?

58:56.080 --> 58:58.970
Political rumble-bumble
don't interest me.

59:01.160 --> 59:03.731
The liberty of mankind
don't interest you?

59:03.880 --> 59:06.611
The fate of the republic
don't interest you?

59:07.360 --> 59:10.170
Traitors like McClellan
don't interest you?

59:10.320 --> 59:13.483
Copperhead vipers in our own
backyard don't interest you?

59:13.640 --> 59:16.450
I thought the copperhead
was a Southern serpent.

59:16.600 --> 59:20.047
- I ain't never seen one in York state.
- Then you ain't looking.

59:20.720 --> 59:22.768
"Crush the serpent's head."

59:24.560 --> 59:26.085
Eh?

59:26.320 --> 59:30.484
We got a serpent in our
own backyard here.

59:30.640 --> 59:32.244
Abner Beech is a copperhead...

59:32.400 --> 59:35.244
and a copperhead is a snake.

59:35.400 --> 59:38.210
Yup, the copperhead is a snake.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.362
Abner Beech is a man.

59:40.520 --> 59:44.047
Maybe he don't share your notions,
maybe he's wrong, but he's a man.

59:49.400 --> 59:55.043
My own boy can't tell the difference
between a man and a snake.

59:55.720 --> 59:58.405
Read Genesis, Ni.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.048
I have, Pa.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.444
Guess I'm too much like Adam.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.887
I bite the apple every time.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.130
Oh.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.442
Even a Beech heard
the call to arms.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.328
It shames me...

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.129
to see you loafing
around the Corners...

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.491
when others are doing
the Lord's work.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.041
I didn't know the Lord's
work was killing.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.125
There's a time for everything, Ni.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.120
And now is the time for
carrying the sword.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.483
There's too many folks
carrying swords.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.530
Not enough pulling plows.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.329
I'm no fighter, Pa. You know that.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.202
You're a sore
disappointment to me, boy.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.528
A sore disappointment.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.445
Go on.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.969
So Mr. Lincoln
emancipated the slaves.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:16.883
If that's what he wants to call it.
Emancipating slaves by enslaving free men.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.162
Hey, Abner, what's wrong
with freeing the slaves?

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.402
I mean, ain't they human too?

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.089
The president don't have any
right to do that on his own.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.924
It ain't in the Constitution.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:37.685
Mr. Jefferson wrote that
all men are created equal.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.081
Those slaves are men, ain't they?

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.445
They are.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.761
They surely are.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.562
But there are cures
worse than the disease.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.609
And war...

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.046
War ain't a cure for this.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.928
Slavery ain't right.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.166
Jimmy, not by my lights,
not by our lights, not by...

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.447
nobody's lights, save the redhots down
by the cotton states thereabouts.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.889
But killing people...

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.361
destroying whole
cities and towns...

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.963
and turning the government in
Washington into God's almighty army...

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.565
that ain't right either.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.488
Only make things
worse, as I see it.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.646
It'll only make for a lot of...

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.162
A lot of dead boys.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.165
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.245
The latest crop.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.164
The ones that could be identified.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.844
Ray Hare's on top.
Killed at Antietam.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.929
We're returning him home to
his kin for proper burial.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.367
Hmph. What's left of him.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.402
He sure was a fine singer.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.688
That he was.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:40.362
I am the resurrection and
the light, sayeth the Lord.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.921
He that believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.840
Whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.482
I know that my redeemer liveth...

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.884
and that he shall stand at the
latter day upon the earth.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.446
And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.811
yet in my flesh I shall see God,
whom I shall see for myself...

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.931
and mine eyes shall
behold, and not another.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.447
We brought nothing
into this world...

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.961
and it is certain we
carry nothing out.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.764
The Lord gave,
the Lord hath taken away.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.001
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.805
Abner at home?

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.042
He's around here somewheres.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.645
You heard something fresh?

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.842
No, nothing.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.009
Only want to talk it
over with Abner is all.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.562
He'll boot you off the
place if you try.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.802
No, me and Abner is all right.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.804
Hello, Abner.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.770
Ni.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.527
You seen Warner Pitts
since he got back?

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.884
Hardly recognize him now.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.249
Think he'd never hoofed it over
plowed land in all his life.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.687
He's got his boots blacked
and his hair slicked.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.411
And he's wearing shoulder
straps and a sword.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.082
And he's the envy of many
a gal including Till.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.763
Holding court at the Corners
like he owns the damn place.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.966
Warner Pitts can go to the devil.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.407
And take his sword with him.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.204
Well, that's what I say too, Abner.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.524
What beats me is how a fool like that can get
to be an officer right from the word "go."

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.491
Him being the poorest
shot in the whole lot.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.609
I mean, I could understand Byron
Truax as an officer, or your own Jeff...

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.524
Whoa! Whoa!

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.724
That's enough, Ni.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.245
Giddap!

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.927
Inside.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.765
Up. Keep going.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.121
- Up.
- Abner, what's the use of getting mad for?

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.881
Let me have my say. When I'm done, you
don't like it, no one's the worse off.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.407
Ain't giving you your
apple back, though.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.883
- Ain't none of your business, Ni.
- Maybe so, maybe no.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.721
Such a thing as being neighborly.
Taking things kindly, as they're meant.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.009
Neighbors.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.642
I've summered them and
I've wintered them.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.287
And the Lord could take the caboodle
of them tomorrow and I wouldn't care.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.762
They've lied about me
and taken from me.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.449
Taken from me things no
man had ought to lose.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.924
It takes all sorts of people
to make a world, Abner.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.886
- You've got nothing particularly against me.
- No, but your breed.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.528
Breed? That don't count.
What does a breed amount to?

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:20.283
You're the last one
who should lug that.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:23.966
You've up and soured on your
own breed, your own son, Jeff.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.206
You're a cheeky cuss, aren't you?

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.926
Who put you up into coming
and talking to me this way?

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.210
Nobody.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.441
It's all my own idea. Hope to die.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.442
Riled me to see you moping up here
not knowing what's become of Jeff...

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.206
and acting like you don't
care when you do care.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:44.124
Jeff sowed.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:45.361
Now he must reap.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.050
You'd feel easier in your mind
if you knew where he was...

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.488
- ...and so would M'rye.
- He snuck out behind our backs...

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.122
to join Lincoln's gang and levy war against
countrymen of his never done him no harm.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:09:00.966
Now, I'm not one to lug scripture
into an argument, like some I know.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.200
But my feeling is:

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:07.331
Who so taketh up the sword
shall perish by the sword.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.249
- Guess I'll talk with M'rye about all this.
- She has borne enough.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:19.040
I don't know what's possessed me, standing
around gabbing my affairs with you.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.210
I bear you no ill will, Ni.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.082
If fathers can't help
the sons they raise up,

01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:26.348
why less can you blame
sons on their fathers.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:30.484
But this ain't a thing I want to talk
about with you, not now nor ever.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.960
Abner, I'm going south.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.523
I'm gonna find Jeff if it takes a leg.
I don't know how much it'll cost.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.286
I've got a little of my own
saved up, but I thought...

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:45.761
Perhaps you might like to...

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.486
Ni, you know I'm not a mean man.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.847
And you know also that if...

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.204
If that boy had behaved decent...

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.489
there's not a thing under the sun
I wouldn't have done for him.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.846
I'm obliged to you for offering.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.240
You...

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.801
You fill your pockets
with apples...

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.450
if they taste good to you.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.568
I don't want your damned apples.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.768
You ain't going south.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.523
Yes, I am.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.566
I can work my way south.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.403
Jeff would do it for me.
I know he would.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.691
Beautiful things they are.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.207
They surely are.
The Democrat tickets.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.432
In all the Corners,

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:21.670
do you think a single solitary soul
is gonna vote for the Democrats?

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.007
A vote for principle is
never wasted, Hurley.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.288
Thomas Jefferson himself
called the ballot:

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.205
"The rational and peaceable
instrument of reform."

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.445
- We'll cast ours with pride.
- As many of them as they'll be allowing us.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.766
When will people learn?

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.288
Lincoln. Lincoln is now conscripting
mere boys into the Army...

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.042
because not enough are volunteering.
He's calling it, uh, a draft.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.921
We will cast our votes for the
Constitution and for the Democrat party...

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.321
and we will walk through
the gates of hell...

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.051
- ...if we have to to cast these ballots.
- Wish I could go.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.969
Oh. A Democrat woman.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.766
Janey, you do tempt me.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.251
- Your name?
- Still Abner Beech.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.721
Timothy Joseph Hurley.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.690
You got your, uh,
naturalization papers?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.491
That I have. That I have.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.890
Hmm.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.165
They make no good.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.606
What's that you're saying?

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.366
I've voted on them same papers
every year since 1852...

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.121
when I helped put Frank Pierce in the
White House. No good, is it? No good?

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.011
- Why ain't they good?
- Because they ain't, that's why.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.050
Don't block the window.
Real Americans want to vote.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.521
- I'll call the law on you.
- Shut up, you Mick!

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.047
- Don't let him vote!
- One copperhead's one too many.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.242
Kill him! Kill that copperhead!

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.368
You stay back away!

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.330
Timothy Joseph Hurley.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.121
Timothy Joseph Hurley.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.206
It was not a red letter day
for civilization, I'm afraid.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.929
Come on. Give us just
one so we can see who won.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.761
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.809
The copperheads have won.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.880
- What?
- "Seymour elected governor."

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.004
We lost the district by 80 votes.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.005
Goodbye, liberty.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.805
Ain't nothing for you.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.043
No copperhead papers here.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.167
If you don't give me that paper, I will
tell Abner and he'll make you sweat for it.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:51.804
"For Governor Horatio
Seymour, 306,649."

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.046
James S. Wadsworth, 295,897.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.763
"Democratic-Constitutional
Union Party victorious."

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.163
We also win lieutenant governor,
canal commissioner...

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.928
clerk of the court of appeals
and inspector of state prisons.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.201
Huh?

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:15.730
Maybe we can set free all those Democrats
that the abolitionists stuck in their jails.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.729
Oh, what a fine day is this.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.129
Oh, looks like York state
caught copperhead fever.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.123
I heard Till wailing about it.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.931
Here she quits us because
her big hero came home...

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.084
and now she's saying Warner went
and got himself shot for nothing.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.859
"The Peace Party won the election,"

01:16:32.885 --> 01:16:36.387
she said, as if it was the
worst thing in the world.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.965
Oh. Let's light the
bonfire tonight.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.489
Let every mother's son down
at the Corners see it blaze.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.766
Tell them we won.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.366
By God, we could take
back the Congress.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.443
If that happens,
it's a done matter.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.601
The war is over.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.807
The South will return.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.765
We'll have our Union back
and our Constitution.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.849
Well, what if the South
won't come back?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.288
What if they say, "Yanks, you go
your way, we'll go ours. Thank you."

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.728
Why, then we just leave them out.
Leave the South right out of it.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.201
This war, this...

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.607
This wicked war between
brothers, it...

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.807
It has to end.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.203
That's why we had
to vote on Tuesday.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.045
That's why we went to the
Corners and cast those ballots.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.364
- For the Democrats.
- For peace, Janey. For peace.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.682
Just think you what's
been going on.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.729
Great armies being raised.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.167
Hundreds of thousands
of honest men...

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.484
taken from their livelihoods and their
families and set to murdering each other.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.009
Whole districts of the country
torn up by the roots...

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.690
and homes desolated and the land
filled with widows and orphans.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:50.088
And nigh on every house,
a house of mourning.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.649
M'rye...

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.521
ain't been feeling
over and above well.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.607
Janey, we will have your bonfire.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.043
And we'll use that pile of
scrap down by the cow barn.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.449
Oh, Jimmy. Real nice.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:43.044
This is the fire of liberty.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.851
Wonder how they like this
down in the Corners.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.525
Good evening, miss.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.887
How do you do, Mr. Beech?

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.482
I've come to see you about
something that is very pressing.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.763
Janey, lay another place to supper.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.526
- No, I can't.
- It'll be there for you if you want to.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.921
Sit down, please.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.842
In one sense,
we ain't your friends.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.824
There's a heap of things
we shouldn't talk about

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:58.270
because they'll only
lead to bad feeling.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:03.406
So we'll leave all
that severely behind.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.600
I understand.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:13.529
- That being said, what's the matter at hand?
- There seems to be different stories...

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.986
but the gist is that a
number of leading Union

01:21:16.012 --> 01:21:18.228
generals have been
discovered to be traitors.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.648
McClellan has been dismissed from his
place at the head of the Army...

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.121
ordered to return to New
Jersey under arrest.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.965
And they say others are to
be treated the same way.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.407
And some think it will
be a hanging matter.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.530
That is just spite because we
licked them at the elections.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.887
I wouldn't worry your
head about that.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.041
That isn't all.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.290
There's been discovered a big conspiracy about
secret sympathizers all over the North.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.163
We've heard that since the first
day of war. There is no evidence.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.722
They say these conspirators are
in every state of the North...

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.686
and that they plan to bring across
infected clothes from Canada...

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.769
and spread smallpox among us.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.920
What kind of cock-and-bull
story will they hatch next?

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:02.244
You don't mean that a girl with a good head
on her shoulders give ear to such tomfoolery.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.246
It doesn't matter what I believe. What
matters is what they believe at the Corners.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.683
- Damn the Corners.
- Mr. Beech, they're coming here tonight.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.446
That bonfire of yours
made them mad.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.249
Heaven only knows what they're
gonna do when they get here.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.164
I couldn't bear not to tell you.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.166
I'm obliged.

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.365
Whatever happens, I'm obliged.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.481
I would be all the more set
on you staying to supper.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.009
You have a hungry look,
Hurley. Red and ruddy.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:44.563
I've been kissed by strawberries
on the hill, as the poet says.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.963
You like Mr. Whittier's poetry?

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.487
Don't know about his poems, ma'am.
Can't say I like his politics.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.131
Perhaps poetry is more
important than politics.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.725
Mr. Beech, I asked a school friend of mine to
send me the papers that came to her house.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.483
I've been going through them
religiously whenever I could be alone.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.482
I don't mean to say I don't think
you're wrong. I do think you're wrong.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.846
But I am starting to understand how you
should believe yourself to be right.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.161
Smoke the damned copperheads out!

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.691
I wasn't born in the woods
to be scared by an owl.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.922
Come on out now, copperheads!

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.684
Eat up.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.091
Hey, Copperhead!

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.368
You're not being very social.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.763
I got a nice, warm
pot of tar waiting for you.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.567
Yeah, copperhead,
it's in your honor.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.371
Come on out.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.725
M'rye, take Janey and
Jimmy upstairs. Stay there.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.043
Hurley, get the ax.
Stay by the kitchen door.

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.728
I think you had ought to go home, dear.
You can leave by the back door.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.565
Come on out!

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.802
What are you waiting for, Abner?

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.611
Why don't you join us?

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.888
Not afraid of a
little fire, are you?

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.562
We've come to take you and Paddy
out for a little ride on the rail.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.966
Hey, Mick, you wanna
be a black Irishman?

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.088
Yeah, let me at him.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.201
- A celebration.
- You know, the fire is warm.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.243
Niggers wanna share some tar.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.528
Come on out, copperheads!

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.087
They're all traitors.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.768
Come on out, copperheads.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.842
Come on out.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.442
Come on out, Paddy!

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.364
They're leaving.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.529
Abner, the house is on fire!

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.289
M'rye, look what I found.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.644
Not the fires of hell
could burn that.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.921
Jeff used to play with it for hours
at a stretch when he was a baby.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.410
Who is it?

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.969
Where is my daughter?

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.651
Come in.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.042
Never under your roof.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:29.488
- I swore I never would, and I never will.
- Under my roof?

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.450
You'd need a crowbar to get
under my roof. What's left of it.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:36.491
I haven't a house anymore, Hagadorn.
So your oath ain't binding.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.160
The Bible says swear not
at all, so come in.

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.325
Where's my daughter?
I stand on a father's rights.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.767
I sent Esther out to you.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.924
Just before your redhots lit
up my house like Gomorrah!

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.169
We didn't intend for that.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:05.164
Well, burning out a viper's
nest is a tricky business.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.605
But your Esther ain't here.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.843
Well, I been home. She's not home.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.931
Good Lord.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:32.527
Hurley, Janey, bring the
lanterns, quick. Jimmy.

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.210
Oh.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.924
Esther! Esther!

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.730
- Esther!
- Esther!

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.884
Esther!

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.565
- Esther!
- Esther!

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:48.846
Esther!

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.968
Esther!

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.080
Esther!

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.245
- Esther!
- Esther!

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.403
Esther!

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:59.561
Well, old '76, what's the word?

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.084
Is she...?

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.601
Well, we looked and looked,
but there weren't no sign of her.

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.004
We'll look again
come morning light.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.960
Likely she just run
off in the woods.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.928
Why did they burn our house down?

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.524
War's a...

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.444
It's a fever, son.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.368
It's a fever, and you...

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:46.448
You get het up, and the fever
push you out of your right mind.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:49.166
You do things you wouldn't
do if you weren't sick.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.405
You...

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:56.122
kill, you maim.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.124
You lose sight of...

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.641
who you are, where you live.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.489
It's like you've got no...

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.808
No kin no more.

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.849
No neighbors.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.129
You lose...

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.162
You lose your bearings.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.890
And you...

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.207
ain't who you really are.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:37.440
Well, well, well.

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.922
If it ain't Winfield
Scott and Robert E. Lee.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.010
War must be over if you
boys have come home.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.482
Why don't you come on in here
and tell me a war story?

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.249
I'm sorry, Jeff.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.364
Others got it worse.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.729
Tell me a good story. Embellish
it as you find necessary.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.885
How about you hear a true tale of courage
and bravery right out of Fenimore Cooper.

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.771
That would please me very much, Ni.

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:06.241
Stick to the facts only
when it's convenient.

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.169
Well, uh...

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.889
the fact is, after taking
my leave of the Corners...

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:17.170
I hopped a freight train to Albany, made
it down to New York on a riverboat.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.961
Hitched up with the
Sanitary Commission folks.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.731
Got them to let me sail
on a boat to Annapolis.

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:25.201
I hung around Camp Parole,
talking with fellas...

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.569
who'd been prisoners in Richmond
and got exchanged and sent north.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.327
And, uh, they said there's a whole slew
of our fellas in Southern prisons...

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.970
brought in after Antietam...

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.920
and they was getting paroled in exchange
for the Johnny Rebs we captured.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.445
I waited around Camp Parole.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.922
And then, uh, one day, along
comes Mr. Blue Jay himself.

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.845
"Long way from the Corners,"
he says, I joshed him back...

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.891
and I went to see the commissioner
about his exchange...

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.442
got his papers fixed up,
and that's all there is to it.

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.124
Thank you.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.802
Is that all there is to it, Jeff?

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.642
Wish I could tell you
a tale, Mr. Avery...

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.885
but there's the war you read
about in the newspaper...

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.441
and there's the war that really is.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.325
Me and Byron Truax was fighting in
a cornfield and got chased out.

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:33.811
We lost our regiment and fell in
with some stragglers from Michigan.

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.521
We waded through a creek and set our sights
on taking a battery on top of a knoll...

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:45.642
but we didn't see the sharpshooters
hidden behind a rail fence.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.211
These rebs gave it to us straight.

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.369
Pow.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.722
Mowed us all down.

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:02.490
Byron got it right in the face.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.847
Let out a kind of little
cry, and that was it.

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.687
At dusk, the rebs come out looking
for guns and blankets off the dead.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.489
Most everybody was
dead, or nearly so...

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.644
but a few of us was
playing possum...

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:22.406
because it would have been
a sure death to get up.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.169
Were you hurt?

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.761
Just a scratch on the arm.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:33.651
The rebs found me and the other living ones
and marched us to the rear of the line...

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:39.887
where they skinned us like bandits
and marched us off to Richmond.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.289
Your, um...

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.131
Your arm?

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.564
It was only a scratch, really.

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.331
But it got worse on the march and
it wasn't tended to decently.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.566
And by the time we got to
Libby, it was purple-like.

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.725
Pus was leaking from it.

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.803
Smelled awful.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.368
I was scared to death.

01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.682
I ain't ashamed to say it.

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.164
Doctor at Libby took one look
at it, said it was gangrene.

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:24.480
Took me in this butcher shop
they called a hospital...

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:28.605
fed me some whiskey, and
cut the damn thing off.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:39.011
Thomas Jefferson Beech,
the one-armed man.

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:44.449
Mighty glad to see you back, Jeff.

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.482
You too, Ni.

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.125
Pa!

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:01.450
Pa!

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.283
Esther!

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.690
M'rye.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.130
Oh, my boy.

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.365
Jeff!

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.965
Pa!

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:05.804
Pa?

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.723
<i>I fear no foe</i>

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.169
<i>With thee at hand</i>

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:32.206
<i>To bless</i>

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:38.563
<i>Ills have no weight</i>

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.769
<i>And tears</i>

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.529
<i>No bitterness</i>

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:53.323
<i>Where is death's sting?</i>

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.404
<i>Where, grave</i>

01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:02.966
<i>Thy victory?</i>

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.921
<i>Each triumphs still</i>

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:13.086
<i>If thou abide</i>

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:20.289
<i>With me</i>

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.369
My pa was not a wishy-washy man.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.524
No, sir.

01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:55.090
Everything he did, he did all out.

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:57.487
And he did it for the Lord...

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.041
whether he was pounding out
firkins or singing out psalms.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.043
Some of you probably wish he wasn't
so all-out when he was singing.

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:15.444
He raised me and my
sis all by himself.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.560
He fed us on Bible verses for
breakfast, lunch and supper.

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:27.410
And I groused at that diet, but I guess some
of it stuck, and I'm grateful that it did.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.405
Now, I ain't one for
quoting chapters.

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.129
Seems to me one of the wisest
things he ever told us was this:

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.368
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.727
I'm gonna say that again.

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.888
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:03.045
Seems to me we do an awful poor
job of living up to that one.

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:07.560
Oh, we love our neighbor just
fine when the sun's out...

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.247
and the crops are high and our neighbor's
agreeing with everything we say.

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:14.200
Oh, we love him just fine.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.128
But he'll be a bit ornery...

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.248
disagreeable...

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.441
maybe got a different way
of looking at things.

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:28.202
All of a sudden, we don't love
our neighbor so much anymore.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.567
In fact, we hate him.

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.567
And we'll call him names.

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.521
We'll burn his house down.
Maybe even kill him.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.121
All the while we sit in church
mouthing the words...

01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:46.965
to pretty little hymns
that we don't mean.

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.607
When I went down to Richmond...

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.489
to go pick up Jeff...

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:04.287
I seen men... Boys really, some
no more than 16 years old.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:07.762
--without arms and legs and eyes.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:11.809
And they was the ones that wasn't
killed. They was the lucky ones.

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.646
I seen black slaves in Virginia...

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:20.562
men, 40, 50 years old...

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.284
and they'd get bought
and sold and whipped...

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:30.924
just because of the
color of their skin.

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.321
And I seen all this...

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.291
and I wondered what happened
to "love thy neighbor"?

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.644
And then I come home...

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:47.802
and I see that Abner and M'rye's
house got burned to the ground...

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.200
and I thought...

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.690
what happened to
"love thy neighbor"?

01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.484
And I found my father dead.

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.525
Dead as any soldier
on a battlefield.

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.569
And I thought...

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:13.007
what happened to
"love thy neighbor"?

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:25.165
Nothing I can say
can bring back Pa.

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:32.126
And nothing I can say can bring
back the Beeches' house.

01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:40.800
Maybe in the face of
all this madness...

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:48.604
we can start loving our neighbor.

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:24.643
One-handed fishing is gonna
take some getting used to.

01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.802
My cooking may take even
more getting used to.

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.123
I shall have to ask Ni for lessons.

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:40.042
What do you think
will happen first...

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.407
our wedding or the war's end?

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.369
That's an easy one.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.568
First lesson of courtship:

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:49.769
Never make a long engagement
to a pretty girl.

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.888
It ain't natural.

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.608
As for the war...

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.210
she has many a hand left to deal.

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:04.040
Many a sorrowful hand.

01:53:05.305 --> 01:53:11.872
