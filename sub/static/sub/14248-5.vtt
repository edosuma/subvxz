00:03.336 --> 00:06.635
Personal Log, Stardate 48546.2.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.936
Our journey home
is several weeks old now,

00:09.009 --> 00:12.570
and l have begun to notice
in my crew, and in myself,

00:12.645 --> 00:15.978
a subtle change as the reality
of our situation settles in.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.107
Here in the Delta Quadrant,

00:18.184 --> 00:20.948
we are virtually
the entire family of man.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.581
We are more than a crew,
and l must find a way

00:23.656 --> 00:25.385
to be more than a Captain
to these people...

00:25.458 --> 00:28.894
but it's not clear to me
exactly how to begin.

00:30.430 --> 00:33.490
At the Academy, we're taught
that a Captain is expected

00:33.566 --> 00:35.466
to maintain a certain distance.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.765
Until now, l have
always been comfortable

00:37.837 --> 00:38.929
with that distance.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.532
Captain, l...

00:43.610 --> 00:45.578
l didn't realize there was
an inspection scheduled.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.272
Not an inspection, Lieutenant.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.746
A stroll.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.909
We should have the warp drive
up and running by 0900 hours.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.748
Recalibrating
the reactant injectors

00:53.820 --> 00:55.549
is the only thing
we have left to do.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.283
Carry on.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.882
Maybe this is
just the way it works.

00:59.959 --> 01:02.052
Maybe the distance
is necessary.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.459
Maybe more than ever now,

01:03.530 --> 01:05.430
they need me
to be larger than life.

01:05.498 --> 01:09.298
l only wish
l felt larger than life.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.337
Computer, delete last sentence.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.607
Gentlemen.

01:15.675 --> 01:18.109
As you were.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.203
So, has Neelix concocted

01:20.280 --> 01:21.804
anything interesting
this morning?

01:21.881 --> 01:25.373
There's an ancient
Chinese curse, Captain--

01:25.452 --> 01:27.579
''May you live
in interesting times.''

01:27.654 --> 01:29.281
Mealtime is always interesting

01:29.355 --> 01:31.255
now that Neelix
is in the kitchen.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.985
We shouldn't judge him
too harshly.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.391
He is helping us
conserve replicator energy.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.394
And l'm sure

01:36.463 --> 01:38.363
the gastrointestinal
problems will go away,

01:38.431 --> 01:41.161
as soon as our systems
get used to his, uh...

01:41.234 --> 01:42.701
gourmet touch.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.137
Well, see you at duty call.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.404
We should have
asked her to join us.

01:54.481 --> 01:58.042
Ensigns don't invite
Captains to sit down.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.710
Why not?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.220
Because they don't.

02:03.389 --> 02:05.482
Well, what's wrong with
showing a little courtesy?

02:05.558 --> 02:07.025
Captains don't want courtesy.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.616
They want respect.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.993
That's why they don't get chummy
with the lower ranks.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.263
Well, who else is she supposed
to get chummy with out here?

02:16.336 --> 02:18.099
There aren't many other
Captains and Admirals

02:18.171 --> 02:19.160
for her to talk to.

02:19.239 --> 02:20.797
lf she wants to sit with us,

02:20.874 --> 02:22.501
she'll ask us to join her.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.338
That's the way it's done.

02:24.410 --> 02:28.870
l think you're working
from an old rule book, Paris.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.383
Neelix?

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.214 --> 03:02.374
Captain!

03:03.383 --> 03:07.820
May l say,
you look beautiful this morning.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.855
ls that a new color lipstick?

03:09.923 --> 03:13.222
No, no, it's the same color
l always wear.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.920
Well, perhaps
it's just the way the glow

03:14.994 --> 03:16.928
of the food heater lamps
hits you,

03:16.996 --> 03:18.395
but you look wonderful.

03:18.464 --> 03:19.795
Not to suggest

03:19.866 --> 03:21.026
you don't always look wonderful.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.365
Neelix, do we have
any coffee left?

03:24.437 --> 03:27.031
No, but we have
something even better.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.973
l don't want something
even better, l want coffee.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.510
lt's made from
a proteinaceous seed

03:31.578 --> 03:32.806
l discovered on an expedition...

03:32.879 --> 03:33.971
Never mind.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.071
l'll use one of my replicator
rations for coffee.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.617
That would not be appropriate,
Captain.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.314
l beg your pardon?

03:45.391 --> 03:48.383
You need to set
an example for the crew.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.558
Well, thank you
for reminding me.

03:52.632 --> 03:53.826
You're welcome.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.834
After all, if you want the crew

03:55.902 --> 03:57.733
to begin to accept
natural food alternatives

03:57.804 --> 04:00.534
instead of further depleting
our energy reserves,

04:00.607 --> 04:04.907
you need to encourage them
by your own choices, don't you?

04:05.011 --> 04:09.710
Fine. Give me your even-better-
than-coffee substitute.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.875
And how about some
Takar loggerhead eggs

04:11.951 --> 04:13.179
with that this morning?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.244
Just... coffee.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.620
lt's a tiny bit richer blend
than you're used to,

04:18.690 --> 04:20.317
but you'll learn to love it.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.690
Bridge to Janeway.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.456
On my way. Janeway out.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.192
Tomorrow maybe.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.741
Ah.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.070
Yes, Commander?

04:37.143 --> 04:38.405
There was no need

04:38.478 --> 04:39.740
for you to come to the Bridge,
Captain.

04:39.812 --> 04:40.836
Yes, there was.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.471
l just wanted to alert
you to a nebula

04:42.548 --> 04:44.106
we've picked up
on long-range sensors.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.344
Put it on screen.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.287
Magnify.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.220
There are unusually high levels

04:51.291 --> 04:53.657
of omicron particles
within this nebula, Captain.

04:53.726 --> 04:56.422
Are you thinking we could
collect these omicron particles

04:56.496 --> 04:59.431
to provide an additional
antimatter reserve, Lieutenant?

04:59.499 --> 05:00.932
Precisely.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.060
Senior Bridge Officers,
report for duty.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.662
Commander, set a new course.

05:06.739 --> 05:09.640
There's coffee in that nebula.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.345
Exploring this nebula
should raise some spirits

07:03.423 --> 07:05.323
around here, don't you think,
Commander?

07:05.391 --> 07:07.086
No way to go but up.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.323
You're closer
to the crew than l am.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.296
How bad is it?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.625
There's a nuanka--
a period of mourning

07:16.702 --> 07:18.192
that everyone's going through.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.329
lt's a natural reaction.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.498
l'm worried about them.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.906
l wish we had
a Counselor on board,

07:23.976 --> 07:26.240
but the nature of our mission
didn't require one.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.242
We talk to animals.

07:30.316 --> 07:33.149
lt's a Native American
tradition.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.379
Animals?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.819
Our own counselors.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.446
We're taught
that an animal guide

07:37.523 --> 07:39.252
accompanies us through life.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.691
Basically, it's what Carl
Jung thought he invented

07:41.761 --> 07:42.750
when he came up with

07:42.829 --> 07:45.696
his ''active imagination''
technique in 1932,

07:45.765 --> 07:46.697
but we'd been doing

07:46.766 --> 07:48.700
pretty much the same
thing for centuries.

07:48.768 --> 07:51.236
ls there a different
animal guide for everyone?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.464
Actually, yes.

07:52.538 --> 07:53.505
Let me guess.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.837
Yours is a bear.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.771
Why do you say that?

07:58.845 --> 08:01.541
You strike me as the bear type.

08:01.614 --> 08:02.808
Thank you.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.281
The bear is
a very powerful animal.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.977
lt has great pokattah,

08:06.052 --> 08:08.350
but he's not my animal guide.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.356
The creature that guides us
doesn't define who we are.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.153
lt merely chooses to be with us.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.261
Okay. lf not a bear,
then what?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.354
l can't tell you that.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.127
lt would offend my animal guide
if l spoke its name.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.430
But he guides you well?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.164
Actually, it's female.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.298
But yes, she usually
guides me very well.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.865
Can one just choose
her own animal guide?

08:31.010 --> 08:32.477
lt's not quite that simple.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.705
Captain,

08:33.779 --> 08:35.905
we are approaching
the perimeter of the nebula.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.677
Slow to one-third impulse.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.844
lf you're interested,
l'll be glad to teach you

08:40.919 --> 08:42.717
how to contact
your animal guide.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.585
You've got a date.

08:44.657 --> 08:46.522
Analysis, Mr. Kim.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.287
Seven AU's in diameter.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.522
Sensors are picking up
intermittent gamma

08:50.596 --> 08:51.893
and thermal emissions.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.898
Nothing our shields
can't handle.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.434
Mr. Paris, any problems
for navigation?

08:56.502 --> 08:59.027
l'm showing
mostly hydrogen, helium,

08:59.105 --> 09:00.538
and hydroxyl radicals.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.403
Some local dust nodules.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.306
l don't see them
giving us any trouble.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.470
Mr. Tuvok, can you find us

09:06.546 --> 09:09.276
a rich deposit of omicron
particles in there?

09:09.348 --> 09:11.646
A significant concentration
appears to exist

09:11.717 --> 09:13.708
approximately
64 million kilometers

09:13.786 --> 09:15.048
inside the perimeter.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.179
Set coordinates.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.347
Aye, Captain.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.754
Engines at one-quarter impulse.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.553
Engage.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.295
l've never seen
anything like it.

09:30.369 --> 09:33.202
Tuvok to Kim.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.706
Mr. Kim, that is a comment

09:35.775 --> 09:36.833
we would prefer not to hear

09:36.909 --> 09:39.036
from a Senior Officer
on the Bridge.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.705
lt makes the Junior
Officers nervous.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.271
Yes, sir.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.617
Density has increased
to 42 percent.

09:47.687 --> 09:48.745
Cause?

09:48.821 --> 09:50.118
Not sure.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.213
We seem to be drawing

09:51.290 --> 09:53.485
some interstellar dust
toward us.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.390
Engineering, could
the magnetic field

09:55.461 --> 09:57.929
from our impulse engines
be attracting this dust?

09:57.997 --> 09:59.624
lt's a good possibility,
Captain.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.930
l'm showing the dust with
a return force ratio of 4.1.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.971
Recommend we shut down impulse
and go to thrusters.

10:07.073 --> 10:07.971
Acknowledged.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.166
Engage thrusters.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.799
Ahead slow.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.436
Density still increasing.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.207
Up by 70 percent now.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.213
Mr. Tuvok?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.442
The level of resistance

10:17.516 --> 10:19.416
poses no danger to the hull
at this time, Captain.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.885
How far to your omicron
particle deposits?

10:21.954 --> 10:23.979
12,400 kilometers.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.080
Maintain course and...

10:25.157 --> 10:26.954
Report!

10:28.194 --> 10:29.991
We're at a dead stop now.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.495
Shutting down thrusters.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.158
We seem to have encountered
an energy barrier.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.996
ls it natural or artificial?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.263
We're not reading
any directed energy source

10:38.337 --> 10:39.304
down here, Captain.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.431
My guess is
it's a natural phenomenon.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.441
How far are we
from the particles, Lieutenant?

10:43.509 --> 10:45.477
Just over 7,000 kilometers.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.478
lt's conceivable
this energy barrier

10:47.546 --> 10:50.037
is related to those particles.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.448
Mr. Kim, if you could get
a transporter beam

10:52.518 --> 10:53.450
through the barrier...

10:53.519 --> 10:54.451
Can't do it, Captain.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.646
The thoron emissions
of the barrier

10:55.721 --> 10:57.154
would interfere with
the transporter signal.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.554
Ms. Torres,
do we have enough power

10:58.624 --> 10:59.989
to take the ship
through the barrier?

11:00.059 --> 11:03.620
The barrier appears
to be only 50 meters deep.

11:03.696 --> 11:04.628
A four-second burst

11:04.697 --> 11:06.221
at maximum thrusters
ought to do it.

11:06.298 --> 11:07.697
All right.

11:07.767 --> 11:08.756
Maximum shields.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.426
Engage full thrusters
for four seconds

11:10.503 --> 11:11.697
and then drop to one-quarter.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.830
Acknowledged.
Engaging thrusters.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.940
What do you make of it,
Mr. Tuvok?

11:22.014 --> 11:25.347
l am unable to offer
an identification, Captain.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.946
Kim to Tuvok.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.886
ln other words,

11:30.956 --> 11:32.924
you've never seen
anything like it?

11:32.992 --> 11:35.119
Oh, l promise
not to tell the Junior Officers.

11:38.764 --> 11:39.924
Captain,

11:39.999 --> 11:42.729
the breach we just made,
where we penetrated the field--

11:42.802 --> 11:44.963
it just closed behind us.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.766
Kes!

11:49.842 --> 11:52.970
Oh! Now look
what she's gotten us into!

11:53.045 --> 11:55.878
Do all nebulas look like that?

11:55.948 --> 11:57.006
l wouldn't know.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.846
l'm smart enough
to go around nebulas

11:58.918 --> 12:00.078
when l encounter them.

12:00.152 --> 12:04.054
These people are
natural-born explorers, Neelix.

12:04.123 --> 12:08.059
These people are natural-born
idiots if you ask me.

12:08.127 --> 12:11.096
They don't appreciate
what they have here.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.630
This ship
is the match of any vessel

12:12.698 --> 12:15.223
within a hundred light years,
and what do they do with it?

12:15.301 --> 12:16.859
''Well, let's see
if we can't find

12:16.936 --> 12:19.029
''some space anomaly today
that might

12:19.105 --> 12:20.265
rip it apart!''

12:20.339 --> 12:23.103
l don't think
the Captain is an idiot.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.302
She cares a great deal
about her crew.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.811
You don't care a great deal
about your crew

12:27.880 --> 12:29.575
and introduce them
to the specter of death

12:29.648 --> 12:30.842
at every opportunity.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.476
And l speak as a member
of that crew now.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.315
l'm not sure l would have
wanted you to come along

12:35.387 --> 12:36.615
had l known
that this is what we...

12:36.689 --> 12:38.281
l think it's wonderful.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.847
Wonderful?

12:39.925 --> 12:40.857
lf l were Captain,

12:40.926 --> 12:42.325
l'd open every crack
in the universe

12:42.394 --> 12:44.988
and peek inside,
just like Captain Janeway does.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.533
l don't deny the romantic...

12:48.601 --> 12:50.933
quality of this sort
of... casting about.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.130
l wouldn't exactly
call it wonderful.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.742
Although...

13:04.817 --> 13:08.446
it's getting more
wonderful by the minute.

13:08.521 --> 13:12.150
l've never kissed anyone
inside a nebula before.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.252
What did l tell you?

13:17.329 --> 13:18.694
Red Alert.

13:18.764 --> 13:19.696
Whatever they are,

13:19.765 --> 13:20.925
they're passing right
through our shields.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.934
Try reversing
the shield polarity.

13:23.068 --> 13:23.932
Mr. Tuvok?

13:24.069 --> 13:25.036
They appear to be made up

13:25.104 --> 13:26.503
of a non-reactive
material that our sensors

13:26.572 --> 13:27.596
do not recognize, Captain.

13:27.673 --> 13:28.697
Clarify
Are we under attack?

13:28.774 --> 13:29.934
Uncertain.

13:30.042 --> 13:31.566
There is no indication
of directed fire.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.611
Torres to Bridge.

13:32.678 --> 13:33.610
Go ahead.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.408
These things
are sticking to the hull.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.745
And l'm showing a drain
on our energy reserves.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.342
A drain?
Why would we be losing energy?

13:40.419 --> 13:41.750
l'm not sure, Captain.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.753
They seem to be drawing it

13:42.822 --> 13:44.289
right through the shield grid
along the hull.

13:44.356 --> 13:45.948
We've lost five percent
of our energy reserves.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.856
Recommend we shut down
all non-essential systems.

13:47.927 --> 13:48.985
Do it.

13:49.061 --> 13:51.689
Reversing shield polarity
hasn't had any effect.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.425
Energy reserves
are down eight percent.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.364
This is not what l had in mind.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.902
Mr. Paris, take us back
through the energy barrier

13:57.970 --> 13:58.994
and out of here.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.071
Reversing course.

14:00.139 --> 14:01.106
Full thrusters.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.970
Thrusters firing.

14:12.418 --> 14:15.444
We're not penetrating
the energy barrier this time.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.716
Sensors show a buildup
of magneside dust

14:17.790 --> 14:18.916
along the outer rim
of the barrier.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.686
Engineering, l need more power.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.589
We can't go back to impulse,
Captain.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.060
That's how our problems started.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.063
Our best chance
is to burn the aft thrusters

14:26.131 --> 14:27.496
beyond the recommended limits.

14:27.566 --> 14:28.931
Proceed.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.468
Acknowledged. Accelerating
deuterium to rear thrusters.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.732
We have a complement
of 38 photon torpedoes

14:33.806 --> 14:35.034
at our disposal, Captain.

14:35.107 --> 14:37.132
And no way to replace them
after they're gone.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.575
Aft thrusters at 105 percent.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.172
1 15 percent.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.479
Barrier still holding.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.711
We need something else.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.844
Give me a two-second blast
from the forward phaser bank.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.582
Firing phasers.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.491
The barrier is undamaged,
Captain.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.120
Ready a photon.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.289
Mr. Paris, assuming

14:59.365 --> 15:01.356
we can breach
the energy barrier,

15:01.467 --> 15:03.458
it's likely to close as
fast as the first time.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.265
l'll be riding the tail
of our torpedo, Captain.

15:05.337 --> 15:06.736
Torpedo is loaded.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.568
Align coordinates
along ship's heading.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.108
Coordinates set.

15:11.443 --> 15:12.876
Fire.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.555
50,000 kilometers
to the perimeter.

15:24.623 --> 15:27.786
l'm having trouble navigating
through the energy currents.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.420
lt's as thick as
a Toarian ice storm out there.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.930
35,000 kilometers to perimeter.

15:33.032 --> 15:34.932
Energy reserves
are still falling.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.968
15,000 kilometers.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.702
We've cleared the central mass.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.641
Stand down Red Alert.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.975
Take us to 2,000 kilometers
off the perimeter

15:48.047 --> 15:49.275
and hold position.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.441
Get a sample of that matter
off the hull

15:51.517 --> 15:52.984
for Lieutenant Torres
to analyze.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.143
l'd like to know what it was

15:54.219 --> 15:56.585
that humbled every
defense system on this ship.

15:56.655 --> 15:59.215
How much of our energy reserves
did we lose, Ensign?

15:59.291 --> 16:01.054
1 1 percent, Captain.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.357
l'm just going to have
to give up coffee.

16:05.431 --> 16:06.989
That's all there is to it.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.552
Dark enough for you?

16:33.625 --> 16:34.683
What?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.125
Get up, Harry.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.389
There's something
you got to see.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.794
See?

16:38.864 --> 16:41.196
How'd you get in here?

16:41.266 --> 16:44.702
You'd be surprised
the things you learn in prison.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.402
MacAllister--

16:50.476 --> 16:51.943
James Mooney MacAllister.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.444
The guy never slept.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.844
He'd be studying
his algorithms until dawn,

16:55.914 --> 16:57.279
and the only way
l could get any sleep

16:57.349 --> 16:58.338
was to wear a mask.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.816
You could've changed roommates.

16:59.885 --> 17:00.909
Are you kidding?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.682
MacAllister got me through
fourth year quantum chemistry.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.690
Besides, l got used
to wearing it.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.385
Something about it

17:07.459 --> 17:09.256
that reminds me
of being in the womb.

17:09.328 --> 17:12.194
Harry, in order to be
reminded of something,

17:12.263 --> 17:13.231
you have to first...

17:13.298 --> 17:15.289
l remember being
in my mother's womb.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.356
Right.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.663
l do.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.601
So what is it
you have to show me?

17:19.671 --> 17:21.332
Nothing that's going to compare

17:21.406 --> 17:23.271
to that memory
of your mother's womb.

17:23.342 --> 17:28.006
Computer, activate
holodeck program Paris-3.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.366
Hey, it's Tom.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.028
Welcome, Tom, welcome.

17:52.104 --> 17:54.595
Hey, Tom, how you doing?

17:54.673 --> 17:56.072
What do you think, Harry?

17:56.141 --> 17:57.733
What is it, a French bistro?

17:57.810 --> 17:58.777
This is where l spent

17:58.844 --> 18:00.709
most of my second semester
at the Academy.

18:00.779 --> 18:03.179
l chose the Starfleet base
outside of Marseilles

18:03.248 --> 18:04.545
for my physical training.

18:04.616 --> 18:07.210
l always had a thing
about the French.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.948
And the French
always had a thing

18:10.022 --> 18:12.081
about you, Monsieur Thomas.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.057
And with a name like Paris,

18:14.126 --> 18:15.650
and a face like that,

18:15.727 --> 18:18.161
how could anyone resist, huh?

18:18.230 --> 18:20.528
Sandrine, this is my friend,
Harry Kim.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.861
Enchante.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.367
Sandrine owns the place.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.232
lt's been in her family
over 600 years.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.862
Tommy.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.668
lt's about time.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.731
l've been waiting for you.

18:30.809 --> 18:34.301
This is Ricky.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.473
l include her in all
my holo-programs.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.710
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:42.688 --> 18:43.848
Mmm...

18:43.922 --> 18:47.551
Your friend the gigolo
wouldn't leave me alone.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.719
lt's what l do, Tom.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.262
Nothing personal.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.299
French father,
Daliwakan mother.

18:54.366 --> 18:57.767
She just sits there
and waits for you, huh?

18:57.836 --> 18:59.098
Like a little puppy dog.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.729
l wouldn't have it
any other way.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.306
Oh, really?

19:02.341 --> 19:05.003
l thought you liked your women
with a little bite.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.171
Everyone knows
about your bite, Sandrine.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.182
lt's when you start
sucking blood they get scared.

19:13.685 --> 19:18.179
Monsieur, can l get you
something to drink?

19:18.257 --> 19:20.725
Just a cup of tea.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.488
Harry, this is France.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.430
Uh, break open a bottle
of that '46 Saint Emilion

19:27.499 --> 19:29.330
you save behind the bar for me.

19:29.401 --> 19:32.131
l don't like to drink
this late at night.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.671
l get an acid heartburn.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.572
Harry, it's holographic wine.

19:36.642 --> 19:37.904
lt doesn't give you acid.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.443
Try to get in the mood, huh?

19:39.511 --> 19:40.671
Sorry.

19:40.746 --> 19:44.147
l learned a great deal
that semester at the Academy.

19:44.216 --> 19:45.615
Most of it right here.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.347
Oui-- and most of it
from me.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.821
l found this place
just after my pocket was picked

19:51.890 --> 19:52.914
walking by the harbor.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.459
Somebody picked
your pocket on Earth?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.392
Oh, they just do it
for tourists.

19:57.462 --> 19:58.622
They give it back.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.096
Most of the time.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.757
Nine ball in the corner pocket.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.733
You see that pool table, Harry?

20:05.804 --> 20:07.704
The table at Sandrine's
at Marseilles

20:07.773 --> 20:10.105
has attracted the world's
greatest hustlers

20:10.175 --> 20:11.574
throughout the centuries.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.076
l thought it might
be fun to program in

20:13.145 --> 20:14.612
some of the great
players to shoot with.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.648
Eight ball in the cross side.

20:23.722 --> 20:27.988
Gaunt Gary, Ames Pool Hall,
New York City, 1953.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.324
They say that he hustled

20:30.395 --> 20:31.623
the great Willie Moscone
himself.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.924
Moscone?

20:33.999 --> 20:35.796
Was he some famous
billiard player?

20:35.867 --> 20:37.664
Game is pool, kid.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.260
Pool.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.364
l don't suppose you'd care
to wager a fin on a game or two?

20:42.441 --> 20:45.467
Oh, he's not ready
for you yet, Gary.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.102
Let me teach him
a few tricks first.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.516
Watch out for him, kid.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.381
He can swallow your wallet
without ever losing his smile.

20:55.988 --> 20:56.977
l'll keep it in mind.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.488
What's a fin?

20:58.557 --> 21:00.457
l'm not sure.

21:00.525 --> 21:03.426
Some old kind
of Scandinavian currency.

21:03.495 --> 21:04.928
Come on.

21:04.997 --> 21:05.929
l'll rack them up.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.727
You pick out a cue.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.401
Harry, this is my idea of home.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.806
My little piece of Earth
out here in the Delta Quadrant.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.273
You shrug it off--

21:22.347 --> 21:24.212
or you like to make
the rest of us think

21:24.283 --> 21:26.251
you're shrugging it off--

21:26.318 --> 21:28.377
but you miss it, too, don't you?

21:29.921 --> 21:31.946
What?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.289
Home.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.895
Your shot, Harry.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.662
Computer, activate emergency
medical holographic program.

22:12.731 --> 22:15.199
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.929
Why do you always
have to say that?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.563
l can only speculate about
my programmer's motives.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.573
Perhaps he thought
l might be summoned

22:22.641 --> 22:23.903
for... important reasons.

22:23.975 --> 22:25.499
Under the circumstances,
don't you think

22:25.577 --> 22:27.101
you really ought
to change your program?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.703
Now, there's
an interesting concept--

22:28.780 --> 22:31.214
a hologram
that programs himself.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.547
What would l do
with that ability?

22:33.618 --> 22:35.415
Create a family,
raise an army...

22:35.487 --> 22:37.250
l know a little about
holographic programming.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.688
l could probably
reprogram you.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.988
That makes me feel
particularly confident.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.153
Has anyone ever told you,
you have a lousy attitude?

22:44.229 --> 22:45.560
lf you don't like
the doctor's attitude,

22:45.630 --> 22:46.858
there's a man sitting
at a console

22:46.932 --> 22:48.627
in the Jupiter Station
Holo-programming Center

22:48.700 --> 22:49.724
you can write to.

22:49.801 --> 22:50.961
His name is Zimmerman.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.197
He looks a lot like me,
actually.

22:53.271 --> 22:55.967
Now, not that l don't
enjoy the repartee,

22:56.041 --> 22:58.475
but was there a reason
you stopped in?

22:58.543 --> 23:00.340
l need a second opinion on this.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.743
Who gave you the first opinion?

23:01.813 --> 23:03.144
l gave it to myself.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.843
lt's a sample of residue
we picked up in a nebula.

23:05.917 --> 23:06.849
A nebula?

23:06.918 --> 23:08.510
What were we doing in a nebula?

23:08.587 --> 23:09.918
No, wait, don't tell me.

23:09.988 --> 23:12.320
We were investigating.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.154
That's all we do around here.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.818
Why pretend
we're going home at all?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.293
All we're going to do
is investigate

23:17.362 --> 23:19.421
every cubic millimeter
of this Quadrant, aren't we?

23:19.498 --> 23:21.625
The molecules are isolinear.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.565
No polycyclic structures, but...

23:23.635 --> 23:27.799
But this is what brought
you to me, isn't it?

23:27.873 --> 23:29.841
The nucleogenic peptide bonds.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.934
ls it some kind
of phospholipid fiber?

23:34.479 --> 23:36.606
And you were doing so well.

23:37.616 --> 23:39.550
Now... l suspect it's something

23:39.618 --> 23:41.950
far more interesting than that.

23:46.558 --> 23:47.718
Come in.

23:47.793 --> 23:50.728
Repair crews have degaussed
the hull, Captain.

23:50.796 --> 23:53.424
Good. Let's plan
an 0700 departure.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.227
What's this?

23:55.300 --> 23:57.996
My medicine bundle.

23:58.069 --> 24:01.095
l've never shown it
to anyone before.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.435
After what you said
this morning,

24:02.507 --> 24:04.771
l thought it was important
to let you see.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.539
Will it help me find
my animal guide?

24:07.612 --> 24:09.079
Eventually,
you'll have to assemble

24:09.147 --> 24:10.307
your own medicine bundle,

24:10.382 --> 24:12.043
but this will allow me
to assist you

24:12.117 --> 24:13.414
in your quest for a guide.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.844
Now?

24:19.825 --> 24:20.883
Now.

24:48.086 --> 24:51.214
A blackbird's wing...

24:51.289 --> 24:53.951
a stone from the river...

24:54.025 --> 24:56.186
an akoonah.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.819
''Akoonah''?

24:57.896 --> 25:00.194
My ancestors used
psychoactive herbs

25:00.265 --> 25:01.789
to assist their vision quests.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.563
Now they're no longer necessary.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.729
Our scientists have found
more modern ways

25:06.805 --> 25:08.773
to facilitate the search
for animal guides.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.866
Place your hand on it.

25:11.977 --> 25:14.912
And concentrate on the stone.

25:18.216 --> 25:19.774
A-koo-chee-moya.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.810
We are far from the sacred
places of our grandfathers.

25:23.889 --> 25:27.120
We are far
from the bones of our people,

25:27.192 --> 25:29.820
but perhaps there is
one powerful being

25:29.895 --> 25:31.886
who will embrace this woman

25:31.963 --> 25:34.659
and give her
the answers she seeks.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.758
Allow your eyes to close.

25:38.737 --> 25:41.672
Breathe to feel
the light in your belly

25:41.740 --> 25:46.643
and let it expand
until the light is everywhere.

25:48.146 --> 25:51.206
Prepare yourself
to leave this room

25:51.283 --> 25:53.308
and this ship,

25:53.385 --> 25:55.546
and return to a place

25:55.620 --> 25:59.852
where you were the most content
and peaceful you have ever been.

26:01.359 --> 26:03.759
You can see all around you

26:03.828 --> 26:05.819
and hear the sounds
of this place.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.328
l know this place.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.203
lt's...

26:16.274 --> 26:18.174
You must not discuss with me
what you see,

26:18.243 --> 26:20.541
or you will offend
your animal guide.

26:22.547 --> 26:25.311
As you continue to look around,

26:25.383 --> 26:26.850
you will become aware
of other life

26:26.918 --> 26:29.079
that shares
this place with you.

26:29.154 --> 26:32.180
lt will be the first animal
you see.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.918
That is the one
you will speak to.

26:34.025 --> 26:36.152
Do you see an animal?

26:44.202 --> 26:45.533
Yes.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.164
Speak to it.

26:48.239 --> 26:50.935
What do l say?

26:51.009 --> 26:53.477
You know what you want to ask.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.550
l'm sorry.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.813
l should've asked the computer
for no interruptions.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.581
Come in.

27:05.590 --> 27:08.991
The Commander was introducing
me to my animal guide.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.322
l hope

27:10.395 --> 27:11.987
that you have
better luck with yours

27:12.063 --> 27:12.995
than l had with mine.

27:13.064 --> 27:14.691
B'Elanna's the only one l know

27:14.766 --> 27:16.791
who tried to kill
her animal guide.

27:16.868 --> 27:17.800
l'm sorry

27:17.869 --> 27:19.166
to interrupt,
but the Doctor and l

27:19.237 --> 27:21.034
have come up with a rather
surprising analysis

27:21.106 --> 27:22.334
of the matter
left on the hull.

27:24.376 --> 27:25.866
lt's organic.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.002
Microscopic life-forms
from the nebula.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.046
That's not what l mean.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.081
The samples are clearly

27:30.148 --> 27:33.049
organic elements
of a much larger life-form.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.086
lt appears, Captain,
that this nebula

27:35.153 --> 27:36.415
is not a nebula at all.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.593
l'm curious, Captain.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.099
Exactly what are you
looking for?

27:49.167 --> 27:50.099
l need to know

27:50.168 --> 27:52.432
if we did serious harm
to this life-form.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.473
Let's see-- you ran
your ship through it,

27:55.540 --> 27:56.700
fired phasers at it,

27:56.775 --> 27:58.504
and blew a hole in it
with a photon torpedo.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.339
l'd say it's a pretty good
chance that you...

28:00.445 --> 28:02.606
Computer, mute audio.

28:02.647 --> 28:04.808
lsolate that concentration
of omicron particles

28:04.883 --> 28:06.043
we were trying to get to.

28:06.117 --> 28:07.277
That would be right here.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.013
Mr. Tuvok?

28:09.087 --> 28:11.078
l'm afraid the concentration
of particles

28:11.156 --> 28:12.555
is far lower
than l originally observed.

28:12.624 --> 28:15.058
Furthermore, it appears
that many of the particles

28:15.126 --> 28:17.185
have now moved outside
the energy barrier.

28:17.262 --> 28:20.163
ls it possible they're leaking
out through the breach we made?

28:20.231 --> 28:22.222
That would be
a logical conclusion.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.665
lt's also a logical conclusion

28:23.735 --> 28:25.703
that all of the phenomena
we've encountered

28:25.770 --> 28:29.069
were actually this life-form's
natural defense systems.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.836
The way the barrier was
protecting the omicron particles

28:31.910 --> 28:34.208
almost suggests we were
entering a vital organ.

28:34.279 --> 28:35.871
So, it seems very clear

28:35.980 --> 28:37.971
that we've severely hurt
an innocent life-form.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.210
How do we repair
the harm we've done?

28:40.285 --> 28:41.843
Uh, Captain?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.622
Computer, resume audio.

28:45.690 --> 28:46.884
How kind of you.

28:46.958 --> 28:49.392
You may be interested to know
that the analysis

28:49.461 --> 28:50.655
of the organic sample

28:50.729 --> 28:53.926
suggested this life-form
has the capacity to regenerate.

28:54.032 --> 28:56.865
The process may simply
need a helping hand.

28:56.935 --> 28:59.961
Any ideas how we could
stimulate regeneration?

29:00.038 --> 29:01.801
Lieutenant Torres
has the answer.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.371
l do?

29:04.442 --> 29:07.070
You were the one who first
observed that this life-form has

29:07.145 --> 29:08.806
a nucleogenic structure.

29:08.880 --> 29:13.579
lf the life-form has
a nucleogenic structure...

29:15.186 --> 29:16.585
nucleonic radiation

29:16.654 --> 29:18.485
ought to assist
its healing process.

29:18.556 --> 29:22.617
A nucleonic beam along
the edges of the breach

29:22.694 --> 29:25.322
should theoretically
promote regeneration.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.796
Bravo.

29:27.866 --> 29:30.391
Commander, take us
to Yellow Alert

29:30.468 --> 29:31.400
and advise the crew

29:31.469 --> 29:33.869
that we're going to reenter
the life-form.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.430
Mr. Kim, review all systems
in light of our first experience

29:37.509 --> 29:40.410
and see if you can
provide new safeguards.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.970
Tuvok, your job is to find
some modification of the shields

29:44.048 --> 29:47.575
that will hold off this life-
form's natural defense systems.

29:47.652 --> 29:50.143
We begin at 1300 hours.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.052
Dismissed.

29:52.123 --> 29:55.923
The bantan is a little
on the spicy side.

29:55.994 --> 29:58.929
Kes grows them herself
in the hydroponic garden.

29:59.030 --> 30:01.191
Don't eat any
of the little pink things

30:01.266 --> 30:02.358
and you'll be fine.

30:02.433 --> 30:04.196
All personnel
report to stations.

30:04.269 --> 30:05.429
Yellow Alert.

30:05.503 --> 30:08.404
Now what?
Neelix to Chakotay.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.940
We're very busy up here, Neelix.

30:10.008 --> 30:10.975
What do you need?

30:11.042 --> 30:12.407
This Yellow Alert business--

30:12.477 --> 30:14.240
l was just starting...

30:14.312 --> 30:16.542
Sorry. We found out that the
nebula is actually a life-form

30:16.614 --> 30:18.980
and we've got to go back in to
repair some damage we did to it.

30:19.083 --> 30:19.981
Chakotay out.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.847
Go back in? Hello?

30:21.920 --> 30:23.785
Well, that's it!
l've had it!

30:23.855 --> 30:24.787
Neelix...

30:24.856 --> 30:27.051
No! l'm going
to the Captain about this.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.721
Come in.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.456
Captain, l understand

30:33.531 --> 30:35.260
that this nebula
we've discovered

30:35.333 --> 30:36.960
is some kind of monster?

30:37.035 --> 30:39.765
Not a monster, Neelix,
but it is a life-form.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.169
Excuse me if l sound crazy,

30:41.239 --> 30:43.764
because someone may have been
playing a joke on me,

30:43.842 --> 30:45.139
but you aren't planning

30:45.210 --> 30:48.338
to take us back into the belly
of this beast, are you?

30:48.413 --> 30:49.812
No joke.

30:49.881 --> 30:50.813
Why?

30:50.882 --> 30:52.372
Because we hurt it

30:52.450 --> 30:54.884
and we have to help it recover.

30:54.953 --> 30:56.648
l did not come on board

30:56.721 --> 30:58.382
this ship to be
a veterinarian, Captain.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.651
And l thought you were
a man of unlimited talents.

31:00.758 --> 31:03.727
l just reached my limit.

31:03.761 --> 31:04.693
So, if you don't mind,

31:04.762 --> 31:06.787
Kes and l will wait on board
my little vessel

31:06.865 --> 31:08.423
for you to return.

31:08.499 --> 31:11.059
All our crews are busy
preparing for this mission.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.830
l'm not pulling them
off their duties

31:12.904 --> 31:14.371
to prepare your ship for launch,

31:14.439 --> 31:16.703
and l'm not going to drop you
off on the side of the road

31:16.774 --> 31:17.900
every time we hit a bump.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.069
When we're finished,
if you want to leave,

31:20.144 --> 31:21.907
that's your business,
but for the moment,

31:21.980 --> 31:23.504
find yourself
a seat with a good view

31:23.581 --> 31:27.608
because, just like Jonah
and the whale, you're going in.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.884
ls that final?

31:30.955 --> 31:32.616
Dismissed.

31:35.860 --> 31:39.887
That's a Starfleet expression
for ''get out.''

31:45.036 --> 31:47.129
Jonah?

31:47.205 --> 31:48.832
Whale?

31:57.548 --> 32:00.108
Approaching the perimeter.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.845
Disengage impulse engines.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.747
lmpulse engines off-line.

32:05.823 --> 32:08.121
Engage thrusters, one-third.

32:08.192 --> 32:09.591
Thrusters engaged.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.390
Red Alert.

32:14.632 --> 32:15.860
Shields are up.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.799
Adaptive harmonics
are operational.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.268
Density is already
more than double

32:19.337 --> 32:20.565
what we encountered last time.

32:20.638 --> 32:22.799
EM hull pressure is approaching
dangerous levels, Captain.

32:22.874 --> 32:23.806
Mr. Kim?

32:23.875 --> 32:24.899
lf my research is right,

32:24.976 --> 32:26.944
releasing positive ions
through the nacelles

32:27.011 --> 32:28.842
should repel
some of the dust out there.

32:28.913 --> 32:31.074
Without causing further harm
to the creature?

32:31.149 --> 32:32.411
l believe so, Captain.

32:32.483 --> 32:33.950
Very well.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.951
lon release confirmed.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.982
Ambient density is dropping.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.120
Hull pressure
is decreasing also.

32:45.196 --> 32:47.027
Hold your course.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.865
14,000 kilometers to the breach.

32:52.003 --> 32:53.971
l can see it.

32:54.038 --> 32:55.164
Magnify.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.671
Engineering,
ready your nucleonic beam.

33:01.779 --> 33:03.770
Ready and awaiting your orders,
Captain.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.409
Mr. Paris,
bring us into position.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.748
Coming about 40 degrees.

33:11.789 --> 33:13.188
Report!

33:14.292 --> 33:17.318
We're being hit by some
kind of multi-polar charges.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.326
They're not like anything
we saw the first time.

33:20.398 --> 33:21.865
Shields at 87 percent.

33:21.933 --> 33:22.922
Will they hold?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.798
The polarity of each charge
is rotating so quickly,

33:24.869 --> 33:25.927
the shields cannot compensate.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.939
We've lost
the rear driver coil assembly.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.668
lnertial dampers are off-line.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.902
l'm losing control.

33:31.976 --> 33:33.944
Hold on!

33:42.987 --> 33:46.388
Engineering, initiate emergency
shutdown of all thrusters.

33:46.457 --> 33:49.551
Captain, the only way
we can shut down all thrusters

33:49.627 --> 33:51.322
is to vent the deuterium
into space.

33:51.396 --> 33:53.591
We can't afford
to lose all that fuel.

33:53.664 --> 33:55.154
We have no choice.
Do it!

33:55.233 --> 33:57.997
Acknowledged.
Cutting thrusters.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.594
lnertial dampers
are still off-line.

34:00.705 --> 34:05.199
Reset lDF baseline at 3-0-0
and reinitialize.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.211
Field processors
coming back on line.

34:07.278 --> 34:10.338
lnertial damping restored.

34:10.415 --> 34:12.349
All stop.
Damage report.

34:12.417 --> 34:15.079
Electro-plasma leaks
reported on Deck 14.

34:15.152 --> 34:16.745
Repair crews are
being dispatched.

34:16.821 --> 34:19.016
Otherwise, we seem
to be in one piece.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.752
l believe the optical data
network is down, Ensign.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.292
Yes, sir.
l'll get right on it.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.833
14 injuries reported, Captain--
none serious.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.165
Have any idea where we are,
Mr. Paris?

34:32.235 --> 34:35.899
Approximately 70,000 kilometers
from our former position--

34:35.973 --> 34:38.533
deeper inside the creature
than before.

34:39.976 --> 34:42.445
Let's hope it has
a slow digestive process.

34:42.513 --> 34:44.174
Yes, ma'am.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.340
We need to get back

34:45.416 --> 34:47.350
to the wound
without causing a response

34:47.418 --> 34:49.851
from its defense systems.
Suggestions?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.478
lt seems to be leaving us alone

34:51.556 --> 34:53.922
now that we've cut off
all propulsion systems.

34:53.991 --> 34:55.982
Maybe that's what cues it
to respond.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.187
lf l'm right, we might
be able to get back

34:58.262 --> 34:59.729
without engaging any engines.

34:59.797 --> 35:00.695
No engines?

35:00.798 --> 35:01.856
We've been reading

35:01.899 --> 35:04.493
these swirling energy currents
since we first got here.

35:04.569 --> 35:05.797
When we thought it was a nebula,

35:05.870 --> 35:07.428
we weren't looking
for any pattern.

35:07.505 --> 35:08.870
We thought they were
just random eddies.

35:08.973 --> 35:11.601
But now, l'm wondering
if these currents

35:11.676 --> 35:14.372
might be some kind
of a circulatory system.

35:14.445 --> 35:17.903
Mr. Kim, are you showing omicron
particles in these currents?

35:21.686 --> 35:22.983
Affirmative, Captain.

35:24.522 --> 35:26.752
lf the currents are distributing
omicron energy

35:26.824 --> 35:27.916
throughout the life-form,

35:28.025 --> 35:31.392
the circulatory system
might pass right by that wound.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.555
We could get in one
of those currents

35:33.631 --> 35:35.223
and surf back.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.324
Use the reaction
control thrusters

35:37.401 --> 35:39.699
in drift mode only, Mr. Paris.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.237
Aye, Captain.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.830
We're on our way.

35:43.908 --> 35:48.845
Speed-- all of 200 kph.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.676
Time for refreshment.

35:50.748 --> 35:55.276
Ailis pate,
Felada onion crisps,

35:55.353 --> 35:57.685
stuffed Cardaway leaves.

35:57.755 --> 35:59.723
l appreciate the thought,
Neelix,

35:59.790 --> 36:01.257
but this is hardly the time.

36:01.359 --> 36:03.418
As the morale officer
on this ship,

36:03.461 --> 36:04.860
l insist that a break
in the workload

36:04.929 --> 36:06.453
is both healthy
and necessary.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.556
Go on, Mr. Vulcan.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.601
lt might even
help you loosen up.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.864
Or not.

36:13.938 --> 36:16.736
May l ask when you
became morale officer?

36:16.807 --> 36:18.536
Oh, just a few minutes ago,

36:18.609 --> 36:21.169
when l sensed crew morale
might be especially low.

36:21.245 --> 36:22.576
Mine certainly was.

36:22.647 --> 36:24.239
We were in a free fall
at the time.

36:24.315 --> 36:26.545
Cooking always helps
Neelix to unwind.

36:26.617 --> 36:30.417
Yes, and after we stabilized
l certainly needed to unwind.

36:30.488 --> 36:31.614
So it seemed to me,

36:31.689 --> 36:33.782
l had a choice to either
come up here and say,

36:33.858 --> 36:34.825
''l told you so''...

36:34.892 --> 36:36.519
No.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.755
or to try to do
something constructive

36:38.829 --> 36:42.196
to help out
in my own humble manner.

36:42.266 --> 36:44.166
Try the stuffed
Cardaway leaves.

36:44.235 --> 36:45.532
They're irresistible.

36:49.507 --> 36:53.500
Now, as your new morale officer,
l thought it might be fun

36:53.578 --> 36:55.341
for us all to sing
a few songs together.

36:55.413 --> 36:56.437
Don't push it, Neelix.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.811
Captain?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.440
Well done, Mr. Paris.

36:59.517 --> 37:00.643
Well done, Mr. Paris.

37:00.751 --> 37:02.480
Take us gently out
of the current.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.817
Stay in RCS drift mode.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.378
Aye, Captain.

37:05.456 --> 37:08.220
Ms. Torres,
prepare your nucleonic beam.

37:08.292 --> 37:09.850
We're ready down here, Captain.

37:09.927 --> 37:13.055
Let's give the wound
two doses to start.

37:13.130 --> 37:15.189
Five bursts
at a two-second interval.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.358
Now.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.132
Analysis.

37:21.205 --> 37:22.137
Scanners are showing

37:22.206 --> 37:25.869
the regeneration rate up
only .04 percent.

37:25.943 --> 37:27.877
l don't know
what we can hope to accomplish

37:27.945 --> 37:29.310
if this is the best we can do.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.814
The breach may simply be
too large to seal.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.611
This is the Doctor speaking.

37:33.684 --> 37:35.117
Please activate your monitor

37:35.186 --> 37:37.086
to the emergency medical
holographic channel.

37:37.154 --> 37:39.281
l believe l may have
a suggestion that will help.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.457
Since no one had the courtesy
to turn me off

37:45.529 --> 37:47.827
after my last consultation,
l've had the opportunity

37:47.898 --> 37:51.095
to observe your progress--
or lack of same.

37:51.168 --> 37:52.465
l believe a slight alteration

37:52.536 --> 37:54.128
of your treatment plan
is necessary.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.365
As inspiration, l've drawn

37:55.439 --> 37:58.203
on an ancient medical technique
known as a suture.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.641
''Suture''?

37:59.710 --> 38:01.405
Before the advent
of laser technology,

38:01.512 --> 38:04.481
surgical fiber was used
to stitch together a wound

38:04.515 --> 38:05.948
to allow it to heal naturally.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.211
How does that help us?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.845
Your ship's energy systems
are compatible

38:09.920 --> 38:12.855
with this life-form's omicron
particles, are they not?

38:12.923 --> 38:14.185
That's right.

38:14.258 --> 38:16.385
Then it is very likely
that this vessel could serve

38:16.460 --> 38:18.792
the life-form's needs in much
the same manner as a suture.

38:18.863 --> 38:19.830
By allowing the ship

38:19.897 --> 38:22.024
to serve as an energy conduit
across the wound

38:22.099 --> 38:23.327
the life-form should be able

38:23.401 --> 38:24.868
to regenerate itself
more rapidly.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.164
And how are we supposed
to get the ship into the wound

38:27.238 --> 38:29.103
without getting the hell
beat out of us again?

38:29.173 --> 38:30.765
That's your problem, not mine.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.138
Doctor out.

38:34.879 --> 38:36.608
That's sort of like
asking a hurt dog

38:36.681 --> 38:38.808
not to bite you
while you tend to its wounds.

38:38.883 --> 38:40.817
You like dogs, Mr. Paris?

38:42.553 --> 38:44.384
Yes, ma'am.
l always had a dog.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.286
l like dogs, too.

38:46.357 --> 38:49.417
When l had to clean out a cut
on my dog's leg,

38:49.493 --> 38:52.929
l needed to create
a little diversion first

38:53.030 --> 38:54.759
to take her mind off it.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.027
Mr. Kim--

38:57.101 --> 38:58.591
prepare a class-4 microprobe.

38:58.669 --> 38:59.727
Aye, Captain.

38:59.804 --> 39:00.771
Lieutenant,

39:00.871 --> 39:03.567
if l gave you a short burst
from our thrusters,

39:03.607 --> 39:05.131
would it be enough
for you to maneuver

39:05.209 --> 39:06.540
into the breach in ten seconds?

39:06.610 --> 39:08.703
l'd feel better if l had 20.

39:08.779 --> 39:10.440
Once we launch that probe
as a diversion,

39:10.514 --> 39:13.347
you might have ten,
maybe even less than that.

39:13.417 --> 39:15.851
Ten sounds good.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.581
Mr. Kim, status?

39:17.655 --> 39:19.486
Microprobe is loaded and ready.

39:19.557 --> 39:22.617
Set coordinates for launch
at 160 mark 70.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.820
Cut power after 500 meters.

39:24.895 --> 39:27.022
l don't want to hurt
this life-form again.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.156
Acknowledged.

39:28.232 --> 39:31.030
Engineering, l'll need
a one-second burst

39:31.102 --> 39:32.467
from our aft thrusters
on my order.

39:32.536 --> 39:33.969
Standing by.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.268
Launch microprobe.

39:40.344 --> 39:41.811
Thrusters.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.073
Firing!

39:50.154 --> 39:52.645
Reading mono-polar charges,
high frequency.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.089
Shields at 7 5 percent
and holding.

39:55.159 --> 39:56.421
Maintain position.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.553
Engineering, direct
two nucleonic beams

39:58.629 --> 40:00.392
fore and aft-- parallel

40:00.464 --> 40:01.556
to the central axis of the ship.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.429
Acknowledged.
Beam engaged.

40:09.473 --> 40:13.466
Captain, l'm showing a rapid
growth pattern along the wound.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.944
Regenerative matter approaching
from both directions

40:16.013 --> 40:17.708
at just under 500 kilometers
per hour.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.340
Hold position.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.078
Captain, the shields are only
designed to withstand...

40:21.152 --> 40:22.983
l'm aware of that, Mr. Tuvok.
Hold position!

40:23.087 --> 40:24.384
Regenerative matter approaching.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.387
Range...

40:25.456 --> 40:27.253
30 kilometers-- fore and aft.

40:27.324 --> 40:29.417
Engineering,
ready full thrusters.

40:29.493 --> 40:30.482
Mr. Paris?

40:30.561 --> 40:31.493
Just tell me when.

40:31.562 --> 40:34.190
Regenerative matter
at 20 kilometers.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.733
Fifteen... ten...

40:36.801 --> 40:38.826
Disengage nucleonic beam.

40:38.903 --> 40:39.961
Fire thrusters.

40:40.037 --> 40:41.561
Thrusters engaged.

40:41.639 --> 40:42.936
Now, Mr. Paris.

40:51.248 --> 40:54.149
40,000 kilometers
to the perimeter.

40:54.218 --> 40:55.810
30,000.

40:55.886 --> 40:58.354
The life-form's regeneration
rate is up 40 percent, Captain.

40:58.422 --> 41:00.617
Looks like it's well on the way
to closing that wound.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.827
We've cleared the central mass.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.100
Captain's Log, supplemental.

41:15.172 --> 41:17.697
We set out
to augment our energy reserves

41:17.775 --> 41:20.642
and wound up depleting them
by over 20 percent.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.804
As a result,
we've set a new course

41:22.880 --> 41:25.348
for a planet
14 light-years away

41:25.416 --> 41:26.883
that Neelix says might have

41:26.951 --> 41:28.646
compatible energy sources
to offer us.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.744
lt is out of our way,

41:30.821 --> 41:33.346
but circumstances offer
few alternatives.

41:33.424 --> 41:35.517
So much for raising spirits.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.420
Turning in for the night,
Captain?

41:39.497 --> 41:41.522
Actually, l'm going
to talk to an animal

41:41.599 --> 41:42.827
and then turn in.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.664
Something Commander
Chakotay taught me.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.363
Supposed to be
quite therapeutic.

41:47.438 --> 41:49.463
You might want
to ask him about it.

41:49.540 --> 41:50.768
l will.

41:54.111 --> 41:55.237
Captain...

41:55.312 --> 41:56.711
What is it, Ensign?

41:56.780 --> 41:59.374
Well, l don't mean
to be out of place,

41:59.450 --> 42:01.611
but if you'd care to join us,
you'd be welcome.

42:01.719 --> 42:03.914
Join you where?

42:09.326 --> 42:11.794
Come on, Tommy.
Let's get out of here.

42:11.862 --> 42:13.420
Easy, honey.

42:13.497 --> 42:15.465
l'm setting the lndian up
for the big hustle.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.659
But he's beating you.

42:16.734 --> 42:21.933
Yeah, that's exactly what
he's supposed to think, too.

42:23.841 --> 42:25.604
As you were.

42:25.676 --> 42:30.306
Well... this is remarkable.

42:30.381 --> 42:34.750
Mr. Kim tells me this is
your doing, Mr. Paris.

42:34.818 --> 42:35.807
Ah... yeah.

42:35.886 --> 42:39.322
lt's just a little
diversion, Captain.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.550
One always knows

42:40.624 --> 42:43.855
when a woman of good
breeding enters a room.

42:43.928 --> 42:46.362
Ma cherie...

42:46.430 --> 42:49.194
may l request
your favorite song,

42:49.266 --> 42:52.133
so that we may dance,
before l take you

42:52.202 --> 42:54.261
to my private felucca
on the wharf

42:54.338 --> 42:57.273
and make passionate
love to you?

42:57.341 --> 42:59.138
Uh... l'm sorry.

42:59.209 --> 43:01.871
lf l had some kind of warning
that you were coming...

43:01.979 --> 43:02.946
You would have changed it,

43:02.980 --> 43:04.447
and l would have missed
all the fun.

43:07.384 --> 43:09.352
l just don't know
what the dolls see

43:09.420 --> 43:10.580
in a gigolo, do you?

43:10.654 --> 43:13.282
Now, me, l got a whole
different approach to women.

43:13.357 --> 43:16.383
Treat a lady like a tramp,
and a tramp like a lady.

43:16.460 --> 43:17.552
Never fails.

43:17.628 --> 43:21.860
Paris, did you program
this guy?

43:21.932 --> 43:23.263
Yeah. Why?

43:23.334 --> 43:25.734
He's a pig, and so are you.

43:32.042 --> 43:32.940
Almost never.

43:33.043 --> 43:35.204
ls this pool or billiards?

43:35.279 --> 43:37.406
Uh, pool.

43:37.481 --> 43:38.743
Right.

43:38.816 --> 43:40.249
Pool's the one with the pockets.

43:40.317 --> 43:42.683
Would you mind
if l gave it a try?

43:42.753 --> 43:44.880
Reculez-vous!

43:44.955 --> 43:47.116
Give the handsome
young woman some room.

43:48.325 --> 43:51.260
Tell me, does she
have, uh, money?

43:51.328 --> 43:53.853
Commander Chakotay, your stick?

43:53.931 --> 43:55.922
lt's called a cue, Captain.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.297
Cue.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.801
All right.

43:58.869 --> 43:59.995
So what do we do?

44:00.037 --> 44:01.834
Do l go first?

44:13.384 --> 44:14.874
Solids.

44:14.952 --> 44:19.048
l saw that coming
a mile away, didn't you?

44:21.058 --> 44:24.926
Ah, you've got a lot
to learn, jeune homme.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.896
But then... l've got
a lot to teach.

44:29.233 --> 44:31.133
Eight ball in the side pocket.

44:32.369 --> 44:34.667
A-koo-chee-moya.

44:34.738 --> 44:36.365
We are far
from the sacred places

44:36.440 --> 44:39.409
of our grandfathers, and
from the bones of our people,

44:39.476 --> 44:41.535
but perhaps there is
one powerful being

44:41.612 --> 44:43.204
who will embrace this good crew

44:43.280 --> 44:45.339
and give them
the answer they seek.
