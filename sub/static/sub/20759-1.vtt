00:23.440 --> 00:24.733
Don't even.

00:25.234 --> 00:28.779
Stupid sea pigeon,
looking at me like that.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.197
Please!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.115
You're also at the
beach with no friends.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.542
Honey, you paid someone

00:41.625 --> 00:44.795
to take a GED graduation photo?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.004
Cool, right?

00:46.088 --> 00:48.465
I was worried no one from class
would show up to my party,

00:48.548 --> 00:51.885
'cause, you know, I wasn't
part of the cool group.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.185
Jacqueline! Jeez! I didn't
think you'd show up.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.939
I wouldn't miss your
birthday or whatever.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.315
The big 4-0.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.027
It's not the same without
Titus, though, is it?

01:09.111 --> 01:11.238
And he won't be back for
another two months.

01:11.321 --> 01:15.826
Or has he been here
the whole time?

01:16.868 --> 01:18.787
Girl, stop talking to me!

01:18.870 --> 01:20.831
You know I'm not real!

01:20.914 --> 01:23.375
Kimmy. That's bad.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.960
Don't let anyone see that.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.004
Anyway, I don't actually
care about Titus.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.506
The only reason I brought him
up was so you and I could talk

01:29.590 --> 01:32.426
about the fact that my
boyfriend is also out of town.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.803
-Titus isn't my boyf--
-Tell me about it.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.097
I miss Russ so much.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.683
I've been filling my days
with the most awful things.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.809
You can't imagine.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.312
Last night, in a
particularly low moment,

01:43.395 --> 01:44.855
I decided to come to this.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.981
Hi, hi.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.943
I brought photocopies
of a dead bird.

01:53.447 --> 01:57.117
I got to break up with him.
It's getting too dangerous.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.952
'Cause he's trying to kill you?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.120
Probably.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.914
But I mean dangerous
politically.

02:02.998 --> 02:06.627
Think about it. I'm running
for District Council.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.419
He's a Durst.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.340
I can't be fighting
gentrification

02:11.423 --> 02:15.552
and poking a son of the biggest
real estate developer in New York.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.720
So he'll be single?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.889
What's he worth? Is
his penis weird?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.432
Sorry, old habit.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.186
Girl, that's nasty!

02:26.772 --> 02:30.817
So, Lillian, now that I have
my GED, what do I do next?

02:30.901 --> 02:34.029
I don't know. After high school,
most white girls go to college.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.282
I thought that was just for rich
kids and only the very best clowns.

02:37.366 --> 02:40.202
Nah, that's just fancy
private colleges.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.664
Me, I went to SUNY Old Paltz.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.374
Go, Jews!

02:45.457 --> 02:46.917
Okay.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.210
I'm gonna do it.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.669
I'm gonna go to college!

03:18.532 --> 03:19.658
<i>That's gonna be...</i>

03:19.741 --> 03:22.744
<i>you know, a fascinating
transition.</i>

03:26.873 --> 03:29.126
Well, I'm off to bed, Titus.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.671
Thanks for letting me sleep
on your big queen mattress.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.589
Crumpets and Cheerios,

03:34.673 --> 03:36.967
and that's a spicy
meatball, Luigi.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.683
Stupid sea pigeon.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.601
What can he do that I can't?

03:46.685 --> 03:49.438
I've fallen asleep on eggs.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.022
My roommate!

03:51.106 --> 03:52.357
And my best friend?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.776
Kimmy, get off of Bed-jamin!

03:54.860 --> 03:55.986
It's not what it looks like!

03:56.069 --> 03:58.405
Wait, Titus. Why are you back?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.866
Sometimes cruises just end
early. It's a very common thing.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.451
I think I know more about
cruises than you do.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.327
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.662
And where's your luggage?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.039
Also, why is one of your
shoes a cut-open beach ball?

04:08.123 --> 04:09.374
Why is your hair shorter?

04:09.458 --> 04:11.376
Or is it that your head
is getting bigger?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.754
Everyone can do questions.
Now, girl, I need to lie down.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.422
I'm starting to feel
land-sick again.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.134
Titus, what happened
with <i>Mahogany?</i>

04:19.216 --> 04:20.635
It's okay if you got fired.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.012
It doesn't mean
you're not talented.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.474
Kimberly, if there's one thing
I learned on that cruise,

04:25.557 --> 04:27.100
it's that what I've been
shouting at bus drivers

04:27.184 --> 04:28.894
for all these years is true.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.437
I <i>am </i> a star!

04:40.071 --> 04:42.032
<i>Wait, you played the lead part?</i>

04:42.115 --> 04:43.700
What happened to Dionne Warwick?

04:43.784 --> 04:47.078
Nothing, she's fine! I think I know
more about Dionne Warwick than you do!

04:53.794 --> 04:55.253
-Hello?
-Sister Kimmy.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.088
It's Richard Shakeer-Mohammed.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.091
I had to join a Muslim gang
and a white-power gang.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.177
It's sort of a <i>Mrs.
Doubtfire</i> situation.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.804
I told you to stop calling me.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.890
Look, you think I really want to be
wasting my prison phone time on you?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.100
I could be calling
a joke hotline.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.144
The divorce papers
are in the mail.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.771
Sign 'em and get 'em back to me.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.233
Why do we even have to go through this?
There's no way that marriage was legal.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.902
<i>And now, in the name of me,</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:21.571
<i>Gosh Almighty, who
you may know from,</i>

05:21.655 --> 05:24.741
<i>I don't know, Italian ceilings?</i>

05:24.825 --> 05:28.453
<i>I pronounce you
Superman and wife!</i>

05:28.537 --> 05:31.039
Thank you, great
and powerful Gosh.

05:31.122 --> 05:35.168
I will see you later on
in Heaven for paintball.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.047
Yeah.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.257
<i>Believe you me,</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:43.843
I wish our marriage was as fake
as the Tooth Fairy or magnets.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.180
But someone in the state of Indiana
is taking it pretty seriously,

05:47.264 --> 05:50.308
because apparently one of us decided
to claim a marital tax credit

05:50.392 --> 05:52.394
and used the money
to buy a Jet Ski.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.812
That had to be you!

05:53.895 --> 05:56.606
-Cla-may-to, Clamato, Kimmy.
<i>-Whatever.</i>

05:56.690 --> 05:59.109
After I sign these papers,
I don't want to hear

05:59.192 --> 06:00.986
your fudging voice ever again.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.946
Look, Kimmy, I'm not your enemy.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.573
-Are too!
-D2!

06:10.120 --> 06:11.788
Bobby, sweetie,

06:12.455 --> 06:14.124
since we've been back together,

06:14.916 --> 06:17.085
I feel like that 12-year-old

06:17.168 --> 06:19.671
at summer camp on
Roosevelt Island,

06:19.754 --> 06:23.592
running around the abandoned
tuberculosis hospital,

06:23.675 --> 06:26.094
scaring ghosts.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.472
But the reason I asked
you to meet me here,

06:29.556 --> 06:33.310
in this very public place
with many witnesses,

06:33.393 --> 06:36.855
is because I don't think
we should see each other--

06:36.938 --> 06:38.690
Okay. Bye-bye.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.617
Mrs. Wayne? Pfft!

06:48.700 --> 06:51.453
The only way I'd be Mrs. Wayne
is if I'm Batman's mom,

06:51.536 --> 06:53.288
except I don't get murdered.

06:53.371 --> 06:57.250
But then he doesn't become
Batman. Gosh. What have I done?

06:58.293 --> 07:02.380
Girl, nothing good ever comes
in a big brown envelope.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.884
Medical results, rejected
Costco applications,

07:05.967 --> 07:08.053
vanity plates you ordered
while intoxicated.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.055
You don't even
have a car, Titus!

07:10.555 --> 07:12.098
No, this is good.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.185
I sign these stupid divorce papers, and
I'm done with the Reverend forever.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.396
Don't sign anything until you have
someone with glasses look at it.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.731
I made that mistake once.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.025
That's why I have to go to that
Army base four weeks a year.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.526
Wait a minute. Why
are you still here?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.236
Have you not seen Mikey
since you've been back?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.280
I probably have.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.407
You people all look
the same to me.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.701
Jeez, I just figured
after two months,

07:31.785 --> 07:34.746
you guys must be dying
to... touch butts?

07:35.997 --> 07:37.332
I do not want to talk about it.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.875
But Mikey knows
you're back, right?

07:38.959 --> 07:41.294
-You must have called him.
-No! I did not!

07:41.378 --> 07:43.546
'Cause I can't see him, not yet.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.006
-Why?
-Because!

07:45.090 --> 07:46.967
I made promises.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.472
I said I would come back
with $16,000 in my pocket

07:52.555 --> 07:53.974
and a working pocket.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.142
I was gonna shower
Mikey with gifts.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.687
Orchestra seats at a
Mets performance.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.605
Mud flaps with a
sexy man on them.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.732
Wait. This whole time
you didn't get paid?

08:02.816 --> 08:03.900
Technically, I did.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.694
I even got a bonus after
my bravura performance

08:05.777 --> 08:07.153
in the Bermuda Triangle.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.048
But then I had to eat
all my paychecks.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.508
I mean, I lost them. Shut up!

08:29.426 --> 08:31.261
Kimmy, I'm tired of failing,

08:31.344 --> 08:32.886
tired of feeling like a loser.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.306
Titus, I've never
seen you like this.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.727
I know. I can barely look
at myself in the mirror.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.690
No, I mean, you got knocked down,
but you want to get up again.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.816
You're Tubthumping!

08:44.899 --> 08:46.317
Mikey believed in me.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.194
He made me follow my dream.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.779
I can't disappoint him.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.240
Then you won't. We'll
find you another job.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.783
-But where?
-Let me catch you up

08:53.867 --> 08:55.285
on the latest in showbiz.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.619
TV is computers now.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.455
I saw an ad on the side
of a bus for a new show

08:58.538 --> 08:59.956
called <i>Turgle, </i> I think.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.249
The bus was going pretty fast.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.294
Home Box Office bought <i>Sesame
Street</i> and fired all the actors.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.963
-Streaming residuals--
-Wait! <i>Sesame Street!</i>

09:07.047 --> 09:08.506
Those jobs last forever!

09:08.590 --> 09:10.008
I'd get to sing
with celebrities,

09:10.091 --> 09:11.801
shove cookies in my
mouth without chewing.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.345
Plus, it'd be great to have someone
else work my arms for once.

09:14.429 --> 09:17.307
-That's just for puppets!
-How do you know?

09:17.390 --> 09:21.394
The downside is I'd have to pretend
to like children and endorse sharing.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.355
But for Mikey, I'll do it.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.775
But do you know how to get,

09:26.858 --> 09:29.944
how to get, how to get
to Sesame Street?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.654
No.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.073
But I know someone who does.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.116
He's the worst monster of all.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.661
I miss <i>you </i> so much, Russ.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.414
Why do you have to go to Africa
and fight rhino poaching anyway?

09:41.498 --> 09:42.916
Who cares how rhinos are cooked?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.751
When he gets back, let's
go on a double date.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.545
You, Russ, me, and
someone we trick.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.963
The call dropped again.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.007
Get it together, Africa.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.760
Jacqueline, can you
look at these?

09:54.844 --> 09:56.429
Divorce papers.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.807
From... you-know-who.

09:58.890 --> 10:02.644
Nice try. I know that means
Voldemort. Now I know he's single.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.938
Can you just make sure he's
not tricking me or anything?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.816
Julian tried to sneak in a
clause in our divorce agreement

10:07.899 --> 10:11.152
that said I could never remarry and
had to die alone in a flea market.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.322
So how did he dump you?

10:14.405 --> 10:17.033
Did he write "it's over" on your
forehead while you were asleep?

10:17.117 --> 10:20.370
But in the mirror it was
backwards, so I saw "revosti."

10:20.453 --> 10:22.038
I got all dressed up

10:22.122 --> 10:25.333
thinking Winston was taking me
to a fancy Italian restaurant.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.877
But then he was
gone, gone forever!

10:31.089 --> 10:33.383
Did you just get these today?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.009
You're not signing this.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.386
But the sticker
says "Sign here."

10:36.469 --> 10:37.554
It's shaped like an arrow.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.348
Kimmy, this man put
you through hell...

10:40.431 --> 10:42.308
cheating on you or whatever.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.686
-He kidnapped me.
-I said, "Or whatever."

10:44.769 --> 10:47.564
But now he wants something
from you, right?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.566
A divorce so he can
get remarried.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.402
Which means now you're
the one in control.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.655
Withhold that signature, and now it's
his turn to feel everything you felt--

10:55.738 --> 10:58.324
anger, frustration, despair,

10:58.408 --> 11:01.536
fear, horniness,
fear-based horniness.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.497
I'm in control now.

11:05.915 --> 11:06.916
I'm not signing!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.210
This'll be fun.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.839
We'll order sushi, open some
wine, and when he calls...

11:12.922 --> 11:16.175
-We'll make him suffer.
-Great! I'll cancel my plans.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.262
Daddy, I can't
come over tonight.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.139
I'll just give you
double insulin tomorrow.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.224
Done!

11:25.268 --> 11:26.686
<i>Five minutes to curtain!</i>

11:26.769 --> 11:28.396
<i>Five minutes!</i>

11:29.314 --> 11:31.733
<i>Your five-minute
call. Five minutes.</i>

11:35.737 --> 11:38.823
I'd say hello, Titus,
but I'm saving my voice

11:38.907 --> 11:42.243
for what the French call
"la performance de play."

11:42.327 --> 11:43.494
Hello, Coriolanus,

11:43.578 --> 11:45.705
and congratulations
on all your success.

11:45.788 --> 11:49.000
You mean appearing in
every single performance

11:49.083 --> 11:53.046
of <i>Matilda...</i>'s
Wednesday matinee?

11:53.129 --> 11:55.715
That's when all of the child
actors have to go to school,

11:55.798 --> 11:57.383
and their roles are
played by adults.

11:58.968 --> 11:59.886
Jealous?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.388
Look, Coriolanus...

12:02.472 --> 12:04.474
I know you got your start
on <i>Sesame Street...</i>

12:05.808 --> 12:06.893
<i>Through!</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:08.728
<i>Through the old rebar.</i>

12:10.772 --> 12:12.815
<i>Over!</i>

12:12.899 --> 12:15.193
<i>Over the nails!</i>

12:15.276 --> 12:17.445
<i>Under!</i>

12:17.528 --> 12:19.822
<i>Under the steamroller!</i>

12:20.907 --> 12:23.743
Child work rules were very
different in the '70s.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.620
I was the only survivor
of that shoot.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.998
Well, now, <i>Sesame
Street</i> is casting,

12:29.082 --> 12:31.459
and I thought you might know
someone there who could help me.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.297
Titus.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.842
You expect <i>me </i> to help <i>you?</i>

12:39.926 --> 12:42.303
The only time I stoop that low

12:42.387 --> 12:44.430
is when I wear shoes on my knees

12:44.514 --> 12:47.100
to play a non-speaking child
in Broadway's <i>Matilda.</i>

12:48.351 --> 12:50.353
Although...

12:50.436 --> 12:52.438
you know what would
be interesting?

12:52.522 --> 12:55.817
A documentary about Frank Lloyd
Wright's brilliant but troubled life?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.777
The producer of <i>Sesame
Street</i> is Mr. Lonny Dufrene.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.696
And, yes, we are still in touch.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.114
Why are you telling me this?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.824
Because I know you,
Titus Andromedon.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.535
I know how weak you are
in the face of adversity,

13:05.618 --> 13:07.286
how easily you give up.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.914
Only when it comes to stuff.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.417
So I'm going to tell
you where to find

13:12.500 --> 13:14.752
Lonny Dufrene every
morning before work.

13:14.836 --> 13:19.007
Tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.,
you can find Mr. Dufrene

13:19.090 --> 13:22.218
in Riverside Park
at 78th Street,

13:22.302 --> 13:25.096
doing an exercise class.

13:30.768 --> 13:31.728
<i>Places!</i>

13:31.811 --> 13:34.314
<i>This is your places
call for top of show.</i>

13:39.652 --> 13:41.988
Great. So, when I want him to call,
he suddenly can't be bothered.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.532
Text and tell him you've
been in an accident.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.075
That sometimes works.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.077
Be patient, Kimmy.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.580
The grandmother from <i>Who's
the Boss?</i> once told me

13:50.663 --> 13:52.915
that you can put up with
anything for ten seconds.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.878
No, no.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.171
He can wait.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.800
He's the last thing
on your mind.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.144
Make it quick. I'm on a horse.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.270
Are they in the mail yet?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.522
I'm sorry, who is this?

14:16.606 --> 14:19.108
What? Are you serious?
It's Richard.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.319
Richard Stemple?
From high school?

14:21.402 --> 14:22.320
<i>No, dummy.</i>

14:22.403 --> 14:24.364
You didn't go to high school
because I kidnapped you.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.865
I can't believe you
don't remember that.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.784
Right, Richard.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.744
Look, I haven't had a
chance to sign that thing.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.539
Because nobody in New
York uses pens anymore.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.083
Everyone just vapes
each other now.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.795
And you weren't able to find
time in your day to go buy a pen

14:38.878 --> 14:40.671
at one of New Jersey's
many fine peneries?

14:40.755 --> 14:43.424
Yeah, I'm just too busy...

14:46.511 --> 14:49.931
hitting a floating tambourine while
my other hand gets a manicure.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.184
Also, I'll have you know,
I'm applying to college.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.936
Without a pen? Good luck.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.854
Thanks for the luck.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.648
I guess I'll play the
lottery now and win.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.358
No. No! I take it back.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.486
Listen, sign the papers
and get it back to me.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.988
They're executing my
best man in three days,

15:06.072 --> 15:07.240
and they are out of the drug,

15:07.323 --> 15:08.616
so they're gonna throw
him off the roof.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.453
My gosh.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.872
<i>He </i> hung up on <i>me.</i>

15:14.956 --> 15:16.040
Perfect timing!

15:16.124 --> 15:17.542
Dinner's ready!

15:17.625 --> 15:19.919
-Mimi, we said don't do that.
-Come on, Mrs. Kanassis.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.838
Well, what's done is done.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.759
What a disaster.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.553
I've been there.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.848
You fall asleep, dream you're
French-kissing Ryan Seacrest,

15:31.931 --> 15:34.767
then you wake up, and it's two rats
fighting over a hard-boiled egg

15:34.851 --> 15:35.893
in your mouth.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.147
No. I broke up with Bobby.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.899
And it was worse than I
could have imagined.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.693
No.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.736
He killed you, and
now you're a ghost?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.989
I don't want to make
sexy pottery with you.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.367
No, he just said, "Bye-bye,"

15:51.784 --> 15:54.454
and walked away,
like it was nothing.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.956
I'll be on the stoop,

15:57.039 --> 16:00.793
throwing stuff at anyone who
looks like they're in love.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.298
Hang on. You're going to bed?

16:05.923 --> 16:07.592
It's 9:00.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.968
You're gonna miss the parade

16:09.051 --> 16:11.846
of Puerto Rican babies
who are up too late.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.848
Well, you'll have to
tell me about it.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.809
I'm going to an exercise class
in a park tomorrow morning.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.644
You're not gonna do that.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.689
I am. I'm gonna get up at
morning, or however you say it.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.359
I'm gonna exercise like those
morons in that Olympic show.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.777
And I will not fail,

16:26.861 --> 16:28.988
because I'm doing it for the
greatest reason of all--

16:29.071 --> 16:30.281
love.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.910
What did I just say?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.085
Hello? This your phone?

16:43.169 --> 16:44.295
What? No. Who's this?

16:44.378 --> 16:46.839
You leave phone in cab!
I am SoHo. Where you?

16:46.923 --> 16:49.675
No, no, no. This isn't my phone.
I'm trying to call Kimmy.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.345
No! Here come accident!

17:01.270 --> 17:02.980
You're talking to K-Biz.

17:03.064 --> 17:07.026
Allah, be praised, K-Biz.
You got your phone back.

17:07.108 --> 17:11.155
It was hard to track down 'cause
I went to so many places today.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.782
I just love walking
wherever I want, don't you?

17:13.866 --> 17:17.078
Opening unlocked doors
and going outside

17:17.161 --> 17:19.454
and then showering alone

17:19.539 --> 17:21.999
and not having a
toilet next to my bed.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.291
<i>Are you listening to yourself?</i>

17:23.376 --> 17:24.252
You know I'm in prison.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.171
Everything that you just said
is fun stuff I can't do now.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.966
Tell you what-- I'll take
you to that go-kart place.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.552
My God, normally, that's,
like, my favorite thing!

17:35.721 --> 17:37.557
It's about time you called.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.016
<i>Well, excuse me, Kimmy.</i>

17:39.100 --> 17:41.102
But a condom full of heroin
exploded in my stomach,

17:41.185 --> 17:43.938
so this whole day has
been for the birds!

17:44.021 --> 17:48.025
I can't figure out what I'm supposed
to do with these divorce papers.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.486
Just fill them out!

17:50.570 --> 17:53.281
It's just, you know how you
always said in the bunker

17:53.364 --> 17:54.949
that women are dumb?

17:55.032 --> 17:56.158
<i>Well, I think you're right.</i>

17:56.242 --> 17:58.202
I mean, these pages
look blank to me.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.912
Flip them over, Kimmy.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.456
Flip 'em over! You're
looking at the wrong side!

18:02.540 --> 18:04.917
This is so frustrating!

18:05.668 --> 18:07.587
I think he's crying.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.258
The rash from the
sushi is real bad!

18:12.341 --> 18:14.594
Somebody help! God!

18:14.677 --> 18:17.138
What was I thinking?

18:21.559 --> 18:23.811
I thought burpees
were just baby burps,

18:23.894 --> 18:27.648
- which is something I'm very...
- good at.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.066
You're late, Lonny!

18:29.150 --> 18:30.735
Man, Dev, sorry, brother.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.154
It's just, like, someone
swiped my recumbent bicycle.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.113
But it's cool.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.366
I'm sure he needed it more than me,
and the universe will pay me back,

18:37.450 --> 18:38.618
like when I found that sock.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.286
Okay, everyone up the hill.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.379
Do it... for Mikey.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.380
Run!

18:54.550 --> 18:56.218
Get really low.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.484
Hey, it's me, man,
Lonny Dufrene.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.403
I had, like, a far out
idea for the new Gordon--

19:14.487 --> 19:16.364
Titus Andromedon.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.491
I bet he's never heard
of you either, lady!

19:18.574 --> 19:21.535
I mean, cool, cool. The '70s...

19:21.619 --> 19:23.371
Let's schedule him first up

19:23.454 --> 19:26.165
and, have a nice selection
of pastries for him.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.750
Nothing with fruit.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.019
Okay, maybe I'll sign if you admit
that there was no fifth Mole Woman

19:47.103 --> 19:48.354
and you were Lil' Lisa.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.480
Is that what you think?

19:49.563 --> 19:51.691
Well maybe I'll just put
Lil' Lisa on the phone

19:51.774 --> 19:54.110
while I drink this
glass of water.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.445
Hi, Sister Kimmy!

19:56.529 --> 19:58.989
<i>Boy, the Reverend
sure is thirsty.</i>

19:59.073 --> 20:00.658
How is he doing that?

20:00.741 --> 20:02.576
<i>Why, thank you, Lil' Lisa.</i>

20:02.660 --> 20:05.162
I need a little hair of the dog.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.832
But I'll take any kind of hair.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.377
You know what? I think you won't sign
because you're still in love with me.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.920
-As if!
-D2!

20:14.839 --> 20:15.756
Hi, hi.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.300
<i>Hello?</i>

20:18.384 --> 20:20.344
<i>Kimmy. Kimmy!</i>

20:20.428 --> 20:23.431
Now I'm eating pizza!

20:23.514 --> 20:24.932
How's the pizza in prison?

20:25.015 --> 20:26.267
Surprisingly authentic.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.269
Yeah, well, it's good here, too!

20:28.352 --> 20:30.020
What are you doing here?

20:30.104 --> 20:33.482
I just wanted to return the
stuff you left at my place.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.527
I couldn't find anything,
so the box is empty.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.242
Why'd you just walk
away like that?

20:43.826 --> 20:45.911
I've never been
good at bye-byes.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.665
But I've known you since 1964.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.876
I was your first alibi.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.755
Lillian, can I stop being insane
and get real for a second?

20:55.838 --> 20:57.423
You're living in the past.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.426
Me, fighting to keep this
neighborhood terrible,

21:00.509 --> 21:02.011
your views on Italians?

21:02.094 --> 21:05.347
I'm not stuck in the past.
I just hate the present.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.559
You know <i>Playboy</i> doesn't
have nudity anymore?

21:08.642 --> 21:11.645
You have to draw the
nipples on yourself.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.689
This isn't healthy, Lillian.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.232
And I'm making it worse.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.027
I bet your cell's pretty small.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.113
My apartment's so big,
I can-- Gosh dang it!

21:21.197 --> 21:23.991
Why don't our shins have butts?

21:24.074 --> 21:25.993
I know it seems like
you're just having fun,

21:26.076 --> 21:28.621
but you let someone back
in your life who's--

21:28.704 --> 21:30.206
who's bad for you.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.707
It's holding you back.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.833
Who, me?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.044
No, that's not what's
happening here.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.712
'Cause it's different
than it used to be.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.298
Not everything's
about you, dear.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.801
Goddamn millennials.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.678
No, Lillian, maybe this
was always about Kimmy,

21:44.762 --> 21:45.888
all of it.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.307
Maybe I let a bad
person back in my life,

21:48.390 --> 21:50.059
but he used to torture me.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.852
Now I'm torturing him.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.521
<i>Hey, you know I'm
still here, right?</i>

21:53.604 --> 21:55.481
Are you talking to someone else?

21:55.564 --> 21:58.859
Man, maybe you're the one that should
have the prison nickname "Rude Dude."

21:58.943 --> 22:01.529
See? I turned the tables.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.490
But you're-- you're still
at the same table.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.259
<i>Hello?</i>

22:30.266 --> 22:33.894
<i>Those pastries were
supposed to be for all day.</i>

22:35.896 --> 22:37.565
Okay, man. Welcome.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.567
Let me hear your 'bet.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.835
And that's why we have seasons.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.170
Wow. Titus, I love it, man.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.839
And I love children!

23:01.922 --> 23:05.342
It's not weird that their teeth get
pushed out of their heads by other teeth.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.263
Fruits and vegetables keep
us healthy and strong.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.520
Far out.

23:17.187 --> 23:20.441
Look, I'd like to do one
more scene, if that's cool,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.736
maybe with one of the
stars of the show.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.238
I was taking a nap in there.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.285
Thanks for helping me move into
Sesame Street, Mr. Frumpus.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.245
Boy, those boxes were heavy.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.748
But now that we're done,
we can go get ice cream.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.250
- I want chocolate.
- And you'll get it.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.044
Sometimes you have to do
something really hard,

23:40.127 --> 23:42.129
like cleaning your room or
finishing your homework,

23:42.212 --> 23:43.797
before you get what
you really want.

23:43.881 --> 23:47.343
I'm glad you're my new neighbor.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.263
I thought that was great, man.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.806
How about you, Mr. Frumpus?

23:52.890 --> 23:55.059
Felt pretty good.
Felt pretty good.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.647
Titus, you're the
real deal, man.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.107
But we've seen a lot
of great people.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.360
Okay, Lonny, you don't
know how bad I want this.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.864
Yeah, maybe we
don't know, Titus.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.618
Like, what would you do to
get the thing you want?

24:13.243 --> 24:15.204
I don't know.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.289
What?

24:17.373 --> 24:18.874
Well, it's like you said, right?

24:18.957 --> 24:20.834
Before you get the
thing you want...

24:20.918 --> 24:24.713
You got to do something
really hard.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.433
-You said that, right, Titus?
-Well, I read it--

24:36.517 --> 24:38.852
And then do you remember what
I said right before that?

24:39.436 --> 24:40.479
Do you, Titus?

24:40.562 --> 24:44.900
I said, "I want chocolate."

24:45.901 --> 24:47.444
And then what did
you say, Titus?

24:48.278 --> 24:50.614
Y-you'll get it?

24:50.698 --> 24:52.991
So you give Mr. Frumpus
what he wants,

24:53.075 --> 24:54.702
and you get what you want--

24:54.785 --> 24:57.579
one of the best TV
jobs in New York.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.544
Come on, let's do this.
My pill's kicking in.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.014
No!

25:15.514 --> 25:17.766
I told myself I would do
anything to get this gig,

25:17.850 --> 25:19.685
because I was doing it for love.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.062
And I would do anything for
love, but I won't do that!

25:22.146 --> 25:23.230
Meat Loaf, man.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.857
Maybe when I'm done, thank you.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.026
But if all that's true,

25:27.526 --> 25:30.237
if I really would do
anything for Mikey,

25:30.821 --> 25:33.198
then I'd forget about
my stupid hang-ups

25:33.282 --> 25:34.992
about money and failure,

25:35.075 --> 25:37.536
and I would go see him.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.538
I would go and see
him right now.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.624
And I wouldn't even have
any meatloaf first.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.589
You creeped him out.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.177
Jacqueline, I have to sign
those papers, right now.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.471
Messing with him was fun,
but it was still him.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.432
I spent the last 24 hours on
the phone with that sicko.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.225
So that's why your ears are red.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.144
But why are your eyes so uneven?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.645
I should be living my life,

26:03.729 --> 26:05.063
raking in mad dough,

26:05.147 --> 26:08.150
sippin' on gin and
juice, laid back.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.236
Okay, fine.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.782
Just initial where it
says "uncontested"

26:14.865 --> 26:16.700
and then sign at the bottom.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.954
And then I can use this pen

26:21.038 --> 26:22.331
to apply to college.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.749
College?

26:23.832 --> 26:25.459
Good for you.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.586
I wish I had gotten my degree.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.589
Back before Julian, I went for
a year, but ran out of money.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.049
Trump University.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.091
Go, Pricks!

26:33.175 --> 26:36.261
Well, good thing I
have $2,000 saved...

26:36.887 --> 26:38.597
plus a pretty rare Beanie Baby

26:38.680 --> 26:40.641
that I would never sell
because his face is too cute.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.142
Two thousand dollars?

26:43.060 --> 26:45.979
Kimmy, even a state
school costs $20,000...

26:46.063 --> 26:47.314
a year.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.607
What?

26:48.690 --> 26:49.983
No.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.861
How am I gonna get my pockets fat
with that kind of cheddar, fam?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.489
Well, you could always get
yourself a rich husband.

26:56.365 --> 27:01.245
But you already have a husband,
and he's got some stuff.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.748
A jukebox, DJ
equipment, a bunker...

27:05.332 --> 27:07.918
A bunker? That's
weird. For what?

27:09.086 --> 27:12.297
My point is, that
stuff's worth money.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.591
That I could use for college.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.093
But how do I get it from him?

27:16.176 --> 27:19.263
You tear up these papers
and contest the divorce.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.691
Looks like someone
is going to college.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.485
And that person and I have
something in common...

27:33.569 --> 27:34.611
college.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.075
This is so dramatic...

27:40.158 --> 27:41.785
running to someone.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.497
Those 35 years of
carbo-loading are paying off.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.094
I'm ready.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.679
I'm so excited.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.276
What the foop?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.768
<i>-Good night, everybody!</i>
<i>-Good night!</i>
