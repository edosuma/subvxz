WEBVTT

00:06.215 --> 00:10.879
[sirens wailing]

00:41.167 --> 00:43.704
I know, I know.
What's a nice girl like me

00:43.961 --> 00:46.122
doing in a place
like this, huh?

00:46.631 --> 00:47.461
Ugh!

00:51.344 --> 00:52.834
The face?

00:53.095 --> 00:54.130
ReaHy?

01:08.152 --> 01:10.518
You know, look, the only way
you losers are getting in here

01:10.780 --> 01:12.270
is if you grow
a pair of double D's

01:12.531 --> 01:14.988
and change your
name to "Do Me".

01:17.161 --> 01:18.697
Eeny”.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.039
...meeny...

01:22.667 --> 01:24.248
...miny...

01:24.961 --> 01:26.497
...Bo's.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.665
Go on with your bad selves.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.633
As for the rest of you...

01:34.887 --> 01:38.345
Drinks are on me!

01:38.683 --> 01:43.177
[crowd cheering]

02:00.454 --> 02:00.988
Dyson!

02:01.247 --> 02:03.203
Give it up, Succubus!

02:03.582 --> 02:05.994
You've leave me
breathless, Wolf.

02:07.003 --> 02:08.743
As I recall,
you used to like that.

02:09.005 --> 02:11.371
| used to like
a lot of silly things.

02:13.843 --> 02:14.878
Is there any Fae law
you haven't broken,

02:15.136 --> 02:15.966
in the last three weeks?

02:16.220 --> 02:17.005
It's called "fun".

02:17.263 --> 02:19.174
Something you haven't
been in a long, long time.

02:19.432 --> 02:21.593
Bo, what did you do now?

02:26.731 --> 02:30.269
[Bo laughing]

02:33.154 --> 02:36.112
Your crime spree ends now!

02:36.365 --> 02:37.024
[Bo laughing]

02:37.283 --> 02:40.366
What do you say, Trick, huh?
Should I beg for Sanctuary?

02:40.619 --> 02:42.120
I'm not going
to fall for that again.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.577
Not this time.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.032
Ugh!

02:47.168 --> 02:48.908
And here I thought
I was your favourite.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.206
I don't know who
you are anymore.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.006
I'm Bo, bitches.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.417
And I'll be back.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.290
[Bo laughing]

03:01.432 --> 03:03.969
Life is hard when
you don't know who you are.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.847
It's harder when you don't
know what you are.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.554
My love
carries a death sentence.

03:10.274 --> 03:14.608
l was lost for years,
searching while hiding...

03:15.446 --> 03:19.064
...only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.069
I won't hide anymore.

03:21.327 --> 03:24.410
I will live
the life I choose.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.880
Pair of earrings,
reported stolen

03:40.137 --> 03:42.423
from Cartier
about a week ago.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.593
A gold woman's watch.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.807
Also probably lifted.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.596
And, um...

03:52.942 --> 03:55.103
[vibrating]

03:56.362 --> 03:58.023
That one's all mine.

03:58.364 --> 04:01.447
Thus lists the personal
possessions of Bo Dennis.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.565
Lineage, unknown.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.409
Genus, Succubi.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.745
The unaligned Succubus.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.408
Don't you want an autograph?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.999
Sweetheart, no one
in here gives a shit.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.084
Then what's with
the peanut gallery?

04:14.338 --> 04:15.703
They all like
to watch the new gals

04:15.965 --> 04:18.923
go through... decontamination.

04:42.616 --> 04:56.417
[prisoners cat-calling]

04:59.175 --> 05:01.131
Thank you.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.516
You must be Bo.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.058
l'm Sylvie.

05:16.317 --> 05:16.726
[hiccups]

05:16.984 --> 05:18.849
And | hiccup
when I'm nervous.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.067
You don't have to be
nervous around me.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.186
Because you're innocent?

05:22.448 --> 05:23.312
No.

05:23.574 --> 05:27.283
I did it.
| robbed that bank.

05:29.121 --> 05:32.488
I did stuff I haven't
been caught for yet too.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.990
What are you in for?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.867
My family was starving.
I stole some bread.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.169
So you're Jean Valjean?

05:39.423 --> 05:40.708
l'm Sylvie?

05:40.966 --> 05:42.752
We just met?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.375
Sorry.

05:46.096 --> 05:49.179
I don't do well
with small spaces.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.343
You been here long?

05:50.601 --> 05:52.091
When I was a kid
and l was acting up,

05:52.353 --> 05:54.810
my mother used to tease me
and she used to threaten me,

05:55.064 --> 05:57.555
saying she'd send
me to Hecuba Prison.

05:57.816 --> 06:01.775
Now... now I'm here, and she
won't even open my letters.

06:08.786 --> 06:11.368
Well, I barely
know my mom.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.454
Though this one time she
did sleep with my boyfriend,

06:14.708 --> 06:16.664
then try to kill me.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.036
Don't you have any kin
waiting for you on the outside?

06:20.297 --> 06:23.255
I've got friends that
are more than family.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.583
At least I did...

06:26.345 --> 06:27.755
...before this.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.391
So what's the deal
with the Femi-nazis?

06:31.642 --> 06:32.552
The guards?

06:32.810 --> 06:33.640
Yeah.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.100
Well...

06:35.771 --> 06:36.977
They're Amazons.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.391
What like Wonder Woman?

06:38.649 --> 06:42.062
Less super-heroic,
more anti-male.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.028
The Amazons refuse
to fraternize with men

06:46.282 --> 06:47.397
or take orders from them.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.569
Not even the new Ash?

06:49.827 --> 06:51.692
Especially not him.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.697
[whispering] Though once
every five years...

06:56.959 --> 06:59.450
they search out
males to breed with.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.588
Nine months later,
they celebrate the birth

07:01.839 --> 07:03.454
of their female babies.

07:03.716 --> 07:05.581
What about the boys?

07:05.843 --> 07:07.925
They abandon
them in the woods

07:08.178 --> 07:10.760
to live or die as they may.

07:15.853 --> 07:16.933
So in summary:
they're charming,

07:17.187 --> 07:19.223
maternal, and
they carry tasers.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.897
Dennis!

07:23.152 --> 07:25.359
Time for work detail.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.122
Get lost, Jobina!

07:41.086 --> 07:42.417
I brought your new nurse.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.626
Put her on the table.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.997
You want to examine her?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.916
I need her history.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.219
Well, it's a helluva
sad story, Doc.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.465
I've loved, I've lost,
my dog done run away.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.762
On the table. Now.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.306
Don't you have a baton that
needs polishing or something?

08:10.032 --> 08:11.442
That was so bad-ass!

08:11.700 --> 08:13.440
You're bad.
You've been a bad, bad girl.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.238
This is the best
role play ever.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.451
Wow!

08:16.705 --> 08:17.364
What is that smell?

08:17.623 --> 08:19.739
Oh, I coated myself in the
secretions of Skunk Ape.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.661
To pass as Fae.
I know, it's pungent...

08:21.919 --> 08:22.783
lt's brilliant.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.876
I gotta admit, it's
one of my better plans.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.291
Better than going undercover
in a corrupt Fae prison

08:27.549 --> 08:29.961
run by a sadistic group
of dude-hating Berthas?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.551
The Amazons are a
proud race of warrior Fae.

08:32.805 --> 08:33.794
Where's your
sense of sisterhood?

08:34.056 --> 08:35.546
I think it was taken
when I was strip-searched.

08:35.808 --> 08:36.763
Hm...

08:37.476 --> 08:38.682
Look...

08:38.936 --> 08:42.144
Look at those gifts,
crafted by the prisoners.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.856
Dr. Evert loved roses.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.860
Pretty crafty.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.155
I guess you weren't the
only girl that loved her.

08:53.409 --> 08:55.525
It wasn't like that.
She was my mentor.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.492
and six-hundred years old.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.782
I wouldn't have made it
through my first year working

09:00.040 --> 09:01.450
for the Light Fae
if it wasn't for her.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.621
She never would've
abandoned her prisoners.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.913
They were her patients.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.127
We'll find her, Lauren.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.291
Keep this on you at all times,

09:12.553 --> 09:14.168
but keep it hidden.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.011
It's only in case
of emergencies.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.677
A giant rock, this early
in our relationship?

09:18.976 --> 09:20.591
Are you saying you
want a commitment?

09:20.853 --> 09:22.889
Are you saying this
is a relationship?

09:25.315 --> 09:26.725
Hello, Warden.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.435
I wanted to see
our newest charge.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.103
Hm...

09:33.365 --> 09:35.651
A Succubus is rare indeed...

09:35.909 --> 09:38.116
and the unaligned Succubus...

09:39.288 --> 09:41.700
Doesn't take kindly
to pervy authority figures.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.367
Fae prisoners at Hecuba

09:43.625 --> 09:46.583
can be as savage as animals.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.712
The doctor is not a prisoner--

09:51.008 --> 09:54.045
My guards know that
it takes a strong hand

09:54.303 --> 09:56.259
to maintain order.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.678
That's why they'd rather die...

10:02.144 --> 10:05.386
...than betray
their loyalty to me.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.387
I'm re-assigning this prisoner.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.106
Uh, she has medical training.
I need her here, Warden--

10:10.360 --> 10:12.146
And I want her...

10:12.946 --> 10:14.811
To clean my office.

10:15.073 --> 10:18.110
I've got a very special
way I like it done, too.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.783
And a special uniform.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.373
See you later, Stinky.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.454
Oh... this better work.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.748
KENZI:
This will never work!

10:34.676 --> 10:36.541
Kenzi--
You can't go in there--

10:36.804 --> 10:38.920
You can't stop me, Trick!
Your troll can't stop me!

10:39.181 --> 10:42.014
I'm calling a meeting,
no questions Ash-ked!

10:49.691 --> 10:52.899
You need to fix this.
You're The Ash now!

10:53.153 --> 10:55.815
That's right, Little Mama...

10:56.073 --> 10:57.779
lam.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.454
I didn't like it,
but I went along

11:05.707 --> 11:07.663
with your
kookalabonza scheme.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.783
Pretended Bo had
committed all those crimes.

11:10.045 --> 11:10.795
Gone rogue.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.582
Taught her how to be a
mighty convincing thief, too.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.422
Your stupid ass plan means
my best friend's tits deep

11:15.676 --> 11:19.510
in enemy territory with
nobody to protect her except--

11:19.763 --> 11:20.092
Lauren.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.178
Dr. Lewis is smart
and resourceful.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.012
Oh, yeah?

11:23.267 --> 11:24.928
When shit gets real,
what is she gonna do?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.721
"Science" people to death?

11:26.979 --> 11:29.595
When it comes to crisis,
Lauren is no slouch.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.642
Crisis?

11:30.899 --> 11:33.276
There's already a
crisis at the prison?!

11:33.527 --> 11:35.108
DYSON:
Well played, Trick.

11:36.196 --> 11:36.981
Hale...

11:37.239 --> 11:38.524
You are The Ash now.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.773
You have to pull Bo
out of there.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.570
The Acting Ash.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.864
The Amazons won't listen to me.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.282
Because of your stupid penis?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.496
I prefer
"untested leadership".

11:48.750 --> 11:49.739
I don't want to go up
the chain of command,

11:50.002 --> 11:51.867
get one of the female
Elders to intervene.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.745
Exposing corruption at Hecuba
is the perfect opportunity

11:55.007 --> 11:57.749
for Hale to make
a name for himself.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.625
Yeah, I can think
of some choice names

11:59.887 --> 12:01.593
for you both right now.

12:04.016 --> 12:06.473
Wait a minute-- This clink's
actually built on top of

12:06.727 --> 12:08.467
"get laid" lines?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.310
Ley lines.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.680
Potent geothermal
currents that strip

12:12.941 --> 12:14.647
the prisoners
of their Fae powers.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.767
So Bo's completely
helpless in there.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.109
DYSON: No.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.562
Lauren slipped her
a Sarsen Stone.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.906
It's made out of the same
material as Stonehenge.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.275
It counters the effects.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.117
The Amazon guards
all carry them.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.986
Hale...
That's classified intel.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.112
You're The Acting Ash.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.784
You don't know who
could be listening.

12:31.043 --> 12:33.284
You told me your old banquet
room was impenetrable.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.081
I said it was available.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.796
You're the one who wanted
more "access" to the people.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.666
This place ain't accessible
to anyone but Al Capone.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.965
And even he'd think the
Speakeasy vibe was a bit...

12:44.222 --> 12:44.847
...stale.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.508
This gin joint was
the swinging-est

12:46.767 --> 12:48.052
hootenanny in town.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.516
Yeah. One more
quip like that

12:49.770 --> 12:52.261
and Trick'll outfit you
in a pair of cement Pradas.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.511
Hey, me and the flappers

12:53.774 --> 12:56.607
used to get geezed
on wobbly pops.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.602
My... condolences.

13:02.115 --> 13:02.945
DYSON: C'mere...

13:03.200 --> 13:04.315
TRICK: Look, Hale...

13:04.576 --> 13:07.818
The Garuda, Baba
Yaga, the Lich--

13:08.080 --> 13:09.661
Worst dinner party ever?

13:09.915 --> 13:10.995
Funny.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.989
I'm just saying,
Bo can handle herself.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.379
Whatever this prison dishes
at her, she can take it.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.921
Ijust... I miss her.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.049
Me too.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.260
No kidding.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.189
WARDEN: Very nice...

13:39.236 --> 13:41.522
But I want you
to scrub a little...

13:42.239 --> 13:44.025
...slower.

13:45.117 --> 13:48.234
And I thought working
retail was humiliating.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.080
What a treat...

13:54.626 --> 13:57.038
...to see a
Succubus in action.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.083
In my office.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.105
This is the latest sample.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.978
Is the subject ready
for treatment?

14:25.240 --> 14:27.902
She will be,
soon enough.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.742
Anything else?

14:32.039 --> 14:34.200
How long you plan
to keep doing this?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.708
As long as
I damn well please.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.918
I'm sorry.
I forgot my place.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.458
Question me again
and your place

14:42.716 --> 14:45.423
will be down below
in solitary confinement.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.419
You know that everything I do,

14:48.680 --> 14:51.262
I do to keep
the Amazon strong.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.135
Yes Warden.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.262
BO: Well, that's sweet.
Love behind bars.

14:58.523 --> 15:02.232
A week ago, the blonde
beat her lover with a bar.

15:07.032 --> 15:07.896
What's her deal?

15:08.158 --> 15:09.398
I saw her working
in the infirmary.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.819
That's somebody
you want to know.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.067
Jobina's got
great connections.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.910
She can get you
just about anything

15:14.164 --> 15:15.449
for the right price.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.748
Oh no... not Maeve.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.584
She was gone so long,
I thought she'd left for good.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.295
She must've done something
awful to get sent back.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.331
Does that
happen often?

15:27.344 --> 15:28.800
It's gonna be different
for me though.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.885
In three days,
I'm out, for good.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.094
I don't care what they say.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.179
What do they say?

15:33.433 --> 15:36.470
Only way anyone really leaves
Hecuba is in a body bag.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.478
Ugh!

15:37.729 --> 15:39.765
Sounds like sweet
Sylvie thinks she's

15:40.023 --> 15:41.979
too good for this place, huh?

15:42.234 --> 15:44.065
You don't think you're scum?

15:44.319 --> 15:45.980
That you belong here?

15:46.238 --> 15:47.774
You'll be back.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.272
Until then, I'll give you
something to remember us by.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.741
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

15:57.374 --> 15:59.080
Well, well, well...

16:01.503 --> 16:03.960
You want a taste, Succubus?

16:04.214 --> 16:05.124
[Bo laughing]

16:05.382 --> 16:07.122
I thought you'd never ask.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.340
Ugh!

16:10.220 --> 16:13.132
[struggling]

16:13.390 --> 16:15.176
Ah!

16:18.895 --> 16:19.884
[Bo laughing]

16:20.147 --> 16:22.012
That was weird, right? Huh?

16:22.274 --> 16:23.559
Warden's office.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.102
Now!

16:33.410 --> 16:34.820
The Warden's office?
ReaHy?

16:35.078 --> 16:37.615
This doesn't look like
the Warden's office, ladies.

16:37.873 --> 16:38.908
Seriously.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.081
[Bo laughing]

16:46.423 --> 16:55.718
[water spraying]

16:57.976 --> 17:00.342
See now, no prisoner's
ever been strong enough

17:00.604 --> 17:02.185
to get the jump on Thraso.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.100
I guess they broke the
mold when they made me.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.312
Oh...

17:05.567 --> 17:09.435
Well, maybe I will take
a look for myself. Hm?

17:33.595 --> 17:35.711
A sarsen stone.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.342
Well now, you couldn't have
come by this on your own.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.306
Golly, Warden, I saw
something shiny in the yard

17:40.560 --> 17:42.801
and I had to have it
for my rock collection.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.519
Ugh!

17:49.069 --> 17:51.230
So someone on the inside...

17:52.489 --> 17:53.774
...is helping you out.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.320
By the time I find her...
...oh, she's going

17:57.577 --> 17:59.954
to be begging
for a simple whipping.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.580
I'm flattered.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.704
But without that
Succubus heat--

18:10.966 --> 18:12.547
It's just wet.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.677
Like you.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.629
I guess I owe you
a real one then.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.975
Let's see how your kisses
protect you now, huh?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.524
Not her face!
I want her pretty!

18:32.153 --> 18:37.773
[Bo struggling]

18:38.034 --> 18:40.867
[hitting]

18:47.294 --> 18:49.125
Bo! Oh my god,
what did they do to you?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.994
I was just coming to find you.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.211
Ah.
Oh God.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.841
Oh, no.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.548
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'll heal--

18:55.802 --> 18:58.293
Like a human, but I will heal.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.135
The sarsen stone--?

18:59.389 --> 19:00.253
It's gone.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.595
I couldn't just sit
by and watch them

19:01.850 --> 19:03.841
beat the hell out
of my cellmate.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.808
No, that's just
not your style, is it?

19:06.062 --> 19:07.677
No, it's not.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.316
I protect the people
that I care about.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.853
Which is why I'm getting
Hale to pull you out of here.

19:13.111 --> 19:13.896
It's only a matter
of time before

19:14.154 --> 19:15.860
the Warden figures out
you're helping me.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.696
What about Dr. Evert?
Who's going to help her?

19:20.493 --> 19:21.903
I found these--

19:22.162 --> 19:24.448
Hidden in a secret
compartment in her desk.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.446
Dr. Evert's been
injecting prisoners--

19:26.708 --> 19:28.073
often rare
species of Fae--

19:28.335 --> 19:30.792
with a powerful
vitamin cocktail.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.832
Well, maybe she was
just juicing them up;

19:33.089 --> 19:34.625
trying to give them some
hope against the Amazons?

19:34.883 --> 19:37.044
The injections were
only given for a week,

19:37.302 --> 19:38.712
then the prisoners
were released.

19:38.970 --> 19:39.959
Half of them
I can't track down

19:40.221 --> 19:42.678
--and the other half--
--the other half re-offended.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.765
And when they do come back,
Bo, they're completely broken.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.931
This Maeve girl?
Re-admitted this morning.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.019
She can't speak.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.104
It stands to reason
that there was something

19:52.359 --> 19:54.725
in the injections that made
the prisoners violent,

19:54.986 --> 19:58.103
or more prone
to deviant behaviour,

19:58.365 --> 20:00.401
ensuring their
return to Hecuba.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.400
I just can't imagine Dr. Evert
went along with any of this.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.492
We don't know
her reasoning, Lauren.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.204
Feelings aren't
always black or white.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.745
I know mine aren't.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.415
Yeah, well, just once,
I wish you could be sure.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.168
[laughing]

20:20.303 --> 20:21.964
Interesting. Um--

20:22.222 --> 20:24.178
The Skunk Ape
excretions seem

20:24.432 --> 20:26.218
to be jacking
up my hormones.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.467
I should get
back to my cell.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.357
Look...

20:36.611 --> 20:38.067
Lauren...

20:38.321 --> 20:39.777
I get it.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.402
You deserve more.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.698
I have to find out
what happened to her.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.287
I have to stay
here at Hecuba.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.282
Well, then we
need to move faster.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.080
I've already
submitted your request

20:54.337 --> 20:56.623
to The Ash for
"medical supplies".

20:56.881 --> 20:57.916
We're in Dyson's hands now.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.630
Dyson's good.

20:59.884 --> 21:00.839
Hm...

21:04.013 --> 21:05.969
You could do better.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.223
You actually work with
these humans every day,

21:13.481 --> 21:15.437
and you never even thought
about eating one of them?

21:15.692 --> 21:17.023
Not even this fat one?

21:17.277 --> 21:18.232
Ah--!

21:20.447 --> 21:22.608
Break my cover,
and I will rip your balls off

21:22.866 --> 21:24.447
and sell them to a
certain butcher we know.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.942
Oh, and I thought
we could do lunch.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.033
I'm not hungry.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.949
Come on, you've
been to the clubhouse!

21:30.206 --> 21:32.788
Kenzi's idea of groceries
is freezies and Midol.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.248
So leave.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.127
Or what
The Morrigan doesn't want

21:35.378 --> 21:37.460
her broken little toy back?

21:37.714 --> 21:40.456
You got a partner
now that Hale's The Ash?

21:40.717 --> 21:41.547
I work better alone.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.042
Ah, see, a partner
might've helped you

21:44.304 --> 21:46.215
work out the
not-so-secret dealio

21:46.473 --> 21:50.136
'bout your Light Fae's detention
center for broken birds.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.758
What do you know
about Hecuba?

21:52.020 --> 21:53.806
Oh, you mean, the
maximum security sisters

21:54.063 --> 21:55.894
that supposedly get released?

21:56.149 --> 21:59.516
Yeah, there's no actual record
of them re-entering society.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.984
They do their time
and then poof.

22:02.238 --> 22:02.647
Bo's been in there for days

22:02.906 --> 22:04.897
and you didn't think
to tell me this earlier?

22:05.158 --> 22:07.365
Sounds more like
lunch talk to me.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.860
Hey! I could be
your new partner!

22:10.121 --> 22:10.871
Huh?

22:11.122 --> 22:13.784
With the big stick and
the handcuffs, ooh ya.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.282
Hey!
Phone call, Dyson.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.659
Something about
a prison doctor?

22:18.505 --> 22:19.244
That your boss?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.292
Put in a good
word for me, mate.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.835
I got my own uniform.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.279
I can't believe you
took a beating for me.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.364
Lay low
when I'm gone.

22:48.826 --> 22:49.815
Okay?

22:50.828 --> 22:52.204
So this is goodbye.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.912
Whatever people
say about you, Bo...

22:55.166 --> 22:57.578
I know deep down,
you're not all bad.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.334
Don't you let me
see your face again.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.461
Okay? Not in here.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.214
Wild warlocks couldn't
make me re-offend.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.216
Scout's honour.

23:38.209 --> 23:38.959
Yo!

23:39.210 --> 23:40.199
Is that it?

23:40.461 --> 23:41.997
Yup. here it is.

23:42.714 --> 23:43.624
Took him long enough.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.917
Well, his best
chemist is behind bars.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.631
Wish I was going with you.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.262
You know the drill.
No wangs allowed.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.503
Face of an angel,
voice of a poet.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.720
Mmhmm.

23:55.643 --> 23:56.598
Hey.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.635
How are you feeling?

23:59.897 --> 24:01.762
Better. Thanks.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.640
And better than
the Norn, I'd imagine.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.186
You never did tell me
what you did to her.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.858
I did what I had to do
to get you back in the game.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.481
You gonna tell Bo
you got your love back?

24:13.161 --> 24:14.196
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.194
Well, you better hurry up,
because someone else

24:16.456 --> 24:17.912
might snap up your girl.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.873
Say, an extra hot
human with legs to spare?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.083
Think about it.

24:29.927 --> 24:30.757
Name?

24:31.012 --> 24:32.297
Kenzi Von Clare.

24:32.555 --> 24:35.342
I'm Bo's honeybee and
I'm here for some sugar.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.010
But you're human.

24:37.685 --> 24:38.845
Trust me:

24:39.103 --> 24:43.642
The shorter the lifespan,
the deeper the quicksand.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.855
Dennis!

24:45.109 --> 24:47.065
Your pet is here.

25:10.718 --> 25:11.707
You wore your redneck wig.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.470
And my Monster Truck thong.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.586
Go method or go home.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.012
How you feeling?

25:17.266 --> 25:19.643
Is anyone buying Lauren's
lame cover as a doctor?

25:19.894 --> 25:21.475
Lauren is a doctor, Kenzi.

25:21.729 --> 25:22.718
Sure.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.516
When you coming
home, Bo-bo?

25:24.774 --> 25:27.186
I have to cut the crusts
off my own sandwiches

25:27.443 --> 25:29.855
and Vex thinks my SpongeBob
impression is "weak".

25:30.113 --> 25:31.569
So Vex is still evil then.

25:31.823 --> 25:32.983
Very.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.234
I have missed you, Kenzi,

25:37.495 --> 25:40.237
I don't think I realized
how much until right now.

25:40.998 --> 25:43.284
It's only been a few days.

25:43.835 --> 25:45.120
You okay?

25:46.504 --> 25:48.119
You get that rash
checked out yet?

25:48.381 --> 25:52.090
Yeah, nothing a good slather
of Polysporin won't fix.

25:52.343 --> 25:54.755
Now speaking of, uh...

25:55.012 --> 25:57.628
oozing bodily fluids.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.179
No touching!

26:03.896 --> 26:05.477
I'll never wash these lips!

26:05.732 --> 26:07.893
I'll be faithful-- this time.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.857
Je t'adore!

26:20.288 --> 26:22.153
Love you too, Kenz.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.033
I'm almost done here.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.755
Stay put.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.209
What's the freaking hold-up?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.673
Never opened...

28:52.523 --> 28:53.979
Sylvie?

28:57.737 --> 28:59.898
I thought you went home.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.863
I am home, Bo.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.743
And I made a family.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.917
You're pregnant!

29:16.964 --> 29:17.953
How?

29:18.215 --> 29:22.709
| just woke up... and voila:

29:22.970 --> 29:28.055
I have my own apartment
and a bun in the oven.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.766
Everything's coming up Sylvie.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.976
No, no...

29:33.230 --> 29:34.936
We can't stay here.

29:35.191 --> 29:35.976
It is not safe.

29:36.233 --> 29:36.813
I have to be good.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.524
I don't want to get
sent back to jail.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.234
I know, I know...

29:40.488 --> 29:42.604
They're going to take it, Bo.

29:42.865 --> 29:45.231
They're waiting for him.

29:45.493 --> 29:48.860
They're always watching.

30:06.514 --> 30:09.881
BO: Creepy prison nursery
with observation deck.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.849
Just when I think
I've seen all things Fae...

30:19.276 --> 30:22.768
Promise me you won't
let them steal my baby.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.986
I will not let that happen.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.697
But you have
to come with me.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.487
What if they see us leaving?

30:28.744 --> 30:30.860
A giant pregnant lady and a
Succubus in a red jumpsuit?

30:31.122 --> 30:33.579
I doubt they'll even notice,
come on. Let's go.

30:33.833 --> 30:34.913
--Ooh!
--Wha--?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.374
[water breaking]

30:37.628 --> 30:39.789
He's coming.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.457
He's, he...

30:41.716 --> 30:43.707
He as in, the baby?
As in now?

30:43.968 --> 30:44.878
[groaning]

30:45.136 --> 30:47.468
Okay! Okay, just
hold that thought.

30:47.722 --> 30:49.053
And hold that baby!
Okay?

30:49.306 --> 30:51.433
I know someone
who can help. Let's go.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.269
--Okay.
[groaning]

30:54.520 --> 30:57.057
Come on.
That's it, just breath.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.349
Bo?

30:58.607 --> 30:59.767
--What's that?
--It ain't gruel.

31:00.026 --> 31:00.765
[groaning]

31:01.027 --> 31:01.857
It's impossible.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.271
It's Fae!

31:05.072 --> 31:07.358
Get me Sylvie's file.
Quickly.

31:07.783 --> 31:08.238
Ugh!

31:08.492 --> 31:09.572
That's it, that's it.

31:09.827 --> 31:10.316
Okay.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.068
What do I do? Huh?

31:12.329 --> 31:14.240
Gather some towels?
Put the kettle on?

31:14.498 --> 31:15.248
Put on the kettle?

31:15.499 --> 31:16.784
Lock the door.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.908
Unless you want an
audience of Amazons.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.626
It's your last chance
to leave, Jobina.

31:20.880 --> 31:21.744
And let you scrub in?

31:22.006 --> 31:23.837
You thought the speculum
was salad tongs.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.001
[groaning] Okay.

31:25.259 --> 31:26.123
It's alright, honey.
Baby's coming fast.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.921
That's good.
Means it's a fighter.

31:28.179 --> 31:28.884
Where's Bo?

31:29.138 --> 31:30.093
I'm right here!

31:30.347 --> 31:31.962
You're a Wanblee?

31:32.475 --> 31:34.056
I thought those were extinct.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.345
Almost.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.218
You have got
to be kidding me.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.266
Wait--
What's a Wanblee?

31:39.523 --> 31:41.104
Extremely rare
North American Fae

31:41.358 --> 31:43.349
with highly-developed
olfactory senses.

31:43.611 --> 31:44.600
What does this have
to do with your pants?!

31:44.862 --> 31:46.398
If the newborn Wanblee
smells Skunk Ape,

31:46.655 --> 31:48.646
it will blow up like
a party balloon.

31:48.908 --> 31:49.693
That's graphic.

31:49.950 --> 31:50.484
Well, that's why
I have to detox,

31:50.743 --> 31:51.698
get rid of these secretions.

31:51.952 --> 31:52.577
What? No, no!

31:52.828 --> 31:54.910
You'll expose
yourself as human!

31:58.125 --> 31:59.740
Then you'll protect me.

32:00.002 --> 32:01.117
You always do.

32:01.378 --> 32:02.993
And I have
to protect that baby.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.540
SYLVlE: No!

32:04.799 --> 32:06.005
Save the lovin' 'til later.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.965
That's how folks end up in
this mess in the first place.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.960
I'll lock the door.

32:18.395 --> 32:19.646
Authoritative, right?

32:19.897 --> 32:23.685
You have the right
to remain... my bitch.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.274
Remember what I said
about breaking my cover?

32:25.528 --> 32:26.517
Hale's called a meeting.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.236
He wants to know how
our convicts are... victing.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.446
All right, let me
just grab my--

32:31.992 --> 32:33.152
Is this a person?

32:33.410 --> 32:34.274
Kenzi, it's not--

32:34.537 --> 32:36.243
This "Evert" chick
did not go quietly.

32:36.497 --> 32:37.577
Or in one piece.

32:37.832 --> 32:39.788
The Dr. Evert,
the former prison doctor?

32:40.042 --> 32:41.122
Oh, this is bad.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.457
Kenzi, there's
no reason to panic.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.838
Unless of course, you're
arranging Dr. Evert's funeral.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.000
I mean, she'll have to be
buried in several boxes.

32:47.258 --> 32:50.170
I'm not waiting for whatever
did this to do it to Bo.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.416
Ag reed.

32:53.556 --> 32:54.511
Hey!

32:54.765 --> 32:56.847
Not that I'm not flattered
by the attention...

32:59.103 --> 33:00.684
She definitely wasn't
pregnant a week ago.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.725
I've never seen such an
accelerated gestation period.

33:03.983 --> 33:04.722
SYLVlE: Ugh!

33:04.984 --> 33:06.940
Contractions are two
minutes apart, Doc!

33:11.282 --> 33:12.362
You're human?

33:13.117 --> 33:15.859
Knew you were too pretty
to be a Skunk Ape.

33:16.954 --> 33:20.367
Look, I need you to
start pushing on three, okay?

33:20.624 --> 33:22.615
One... two... three!

33:22.960 --> 33:23.949
Ugh!

33:24.211 --> 33:25.951
Good. Again.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.202
[groaning]

33:27.464 --> 33:29.079
I can see the baby's head!
The baby's crowning.

33:29.341 --> 33:29.921
Is he cute?

33:30.176 --> 33:32.337
Um, well, I mean,
his head looks very...

33:32.595 --> 33:34.051
symmetrical. From here.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.670
Oh, my God!

33:35.931 --> 33:36.966
Take this towel!

33:37.224 --> 33:38.054
Get ready to play catcher.

33:38.309 --> 33:39.219
Wha-- Me?

33:39.476 --> 33:41.057
It's the miracle of life.
Suck it up.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.052
Okay, Sylvie,
I need one more big push.

33:43.314 --> 33:44.929
Okay?
I know you can do this.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.227
[groaning]

33:47.484 --> 33:48.610
Ugh!

33:50.070 --> 33:52.231
[baby crying]

33:52.489 --> 33:53.865
Is he okay?

33:54.450 --> 33:55.815
Oh, he's...

33:56.076 --> 33:56.940
He's perfect.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.488
[laughing]

33:58.746 --> 34:00.657
He's a he! [laughing]

34:00.915 --> 34:02.200
Oh, wow...

34:02.458 --> 34:03.868
Oh, wow.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.079
Isn't this amazing?

34:08.172 --> 34:09.082
So amazing.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.080
You,
you were amazing.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.508
I always liked the
name Ethan for a boy.

34:14.762 --> 34:16.753
Charlotte for a girl.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.925
You have baby names?

34:19.183 --> 34:20.844
You want babies?

34:21.101 --> 34:23.228
Absolutely. Don't you?

34:23.479 --> 34:26.095
What'd you say we let
the mama take a look?

34:26.357 --> 34:28.188
I'd love to.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.980
Now hand over my baby.

34:40.496 --> 34:41.485
Bo promised--

34:41.747 --> 34:43.908
She promised nothing
would happen to my baby.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.664
Then nothing will.

34:50.881 --> 34:53.418
You've been
breeding prisoners.

34:54.343 --> 34:55.423
Well, the adoption market

34:55.678 --> 34:57.885
for unusual Fae is
quite lucrative.

34:58.138 --> 35:01.221
Sylvie wasn't pregnant
a couple of days ago.

35:01.475 --> 35:03.215
That's what was
in those canisters.

35:03.477 --> 35:07.095
Some sort of
magical sperm-- ew.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.096
What kind of Fae
can do that?

35:09.358 --> 35:10.939
A Liderc. Trickster Fae

35:11.193 --> 35:14.276
capable of impregnating
a host without detection.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.986
The oblivious mother
finds herself

35:16.240 --> 35:19.277
delivering his baby
mere days later.

35:19.535 --> 35:21.776
Then we wipe the
mothers' memories,

35:22.037 --> 35:23.868
convince them
they've re-offended

35:24.123 --> 35:24.953
out in the world...

35:25.207 --> 35:28.119
When they never
even left the prison.

35:30.504 --> 35:32.244
Take my son.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.663
Careful now.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.665
Dr. Lewis insists the Amazon

35:36.927 --> 35:38.508
are a proud and noble race.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.377
Why would they
go along with this?

35:40.639 --> 35:42.595
Because I'm their leader!

35:43.517 --> 35:46.509
What would the
Amazons be without duty,

35:46.770 --> 35:48.306
without honour?

35:48.647 --> 35:49.181
Nothing!

35:49.440 --> 35:50.395
I wouldn't, Doctor!

35:50.649 --> 35:52.264
I wouldn't!

35:52.526 --> 35:53.891
You smell that?

35:54.153 --> 35:55.438
And I just grazed her.

35:55.696 --> 35:59.109
One more step and
nine thousand volts.

35:59.575 --> 36:00.690
We'll be having a BBQ.

36:00.951 --> 36:03.442
At the behest
of The Ash, I warn you.

36:03.704 --> 36:05.160
You're a human.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.617
And she's not Light Fae.

36:07.875 --> 36:11.709
Which means I can sell
her baby to either side.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.294
And I'll be damned
if I'm going to lose

36:14.548 --> 36:16.288
a chance to breed a Succubus.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.175
No!

36:17.426 --> 36:18.836
I would rather die.

36:19.470 --> 36:20.755
You will.

36:21.638 --> 36:25.301
After you've spawned.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.305
Abort, abort!

36:29.563 --> 36:31.804
Operation Chained
Cootch is officially over.

36:32.066 --> 36:34.557
Baby, you better sign
or seal or spit on

36:34.818 --> 36:36.774
whatever you need
to end this thing now.

36:37.029 --> 36:37.814
Pardon?

36:38.072 --> 36:40.358
We gotta get in there
and pinch those broads!

36:40.616 --> 36:43.232
Or, you know, better yet,
knock 'em off.

36:45.079 --> 36:45.659
So rry--

36:45.913 --> 36:47.403
This place has
that effect on me.

36:47.664 --> 36:48.744
Dyson?

36:48.999 --> 36:50.375
We found the body
of the former prison doctor..

36:50.626 --> 36:51.991
And then Vex showed
Kenzi the photos.

36:52.252 --> 36:55.085
Yeah, you thought it was
hilarious, didn't ya, darlin'?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.084
I did get a call
from the prison infirmary.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.333
Figured it was a mis-dial.
All I heard was--

37:00.594 --> 37:01.424
What?

37:01.678 --> 37:03.134
Someone yelling.

37:04.181 --> 37:04.590
I'm on it.

37:04.848 --> 37:05.473
I'm coming.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.759
I'm bored.

37:07.017 --> 37:09.133
Wish I could get
in on the action.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.434
You're the new Ash.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.638
You'll be missed,
though... Sir.

37:15.984 --> 37:19.226
I have this sudden
urge to don a fedora

37:19.488 --> 37:20.773
and dance a Charleston.

37:21.031 --> 37:23.943
And I do not dance
the Charleston.

37:24.827 --> 37:27.068
Unless, of course,
you want me to..?

37:30.791 --> 37:31.746
My guards are disciplined,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.956
but they have
a warrior's appetite.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.623
They'll devour the human
doctor while you all watch.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.290
You leave her out of this.

37:38.549 --> 37:39.584
You've got me.

37:39.842 --> 37:41.378
Is that what
happened to Dr. Evert?

37:41.635 --> 37:43.375
She was going
to tattle to The Ash

37:43.637 --> 37:44.797
about our little baby farm.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.920
The prisoners had
to watch her die too,

37:47.182 --> 37:49.343
to teach them
a lesson in discretion.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.511
[choking]

37:50.769 --> 37:51.474
Jobina!

37:51.728 --> 37:53.810
You've got one shot, Succubus!

37:54.648 --> 37:55.728
[fighting]

38:05.701 --> 38:06.451
She's bluffing.

38:06.702 --> 38:07.487
She's powerless.

38:07.744 --> 38:09.325
I knew that was
a lot of stubble,

38:09.580 --> 38:10.569
even for an Amazon.

38:10.831 --> 38:12.867
Your beloved
leader is a man!

38:13.625 --> 38:14.660
He's a Liderc.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.201
He's been impregnating
the prisoners himself.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.498
This is ridiculous!

38:18.755 --> 38:20.040
You disposed of all
the canisters down below.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.506
You brought them in
as decoys for the Amazons.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.296
She'll say anything
to save her human lover!

38:27.264 --> 38:29.050
Ahh!

38:29.308 --> 38:30.047
Wow.

38:30.309 --> 38:32.425
We're not the only things
undercover at Hecuba.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.847
I was doing those
babies a favour!

38:35.898 --> 38:37.308
My mother was an Amazon!

38:37.566 --> 38:38.191
[Amazons growling]

38:38.442 --> 38:39.727
I'm one of you!

38:40.068 --> 38:41.194
I'm one of you!

38:41.820 --> 38:43.060
I'm one of you!

38:43.322 --> 38:45.984
[cell doors opening]

39:04.134 --> 39:06.341
Time to go, "human lover".

39:10.265 --> 39:12.301
I just hope Hale
got my message.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.429
I'm sure the
cavalry's on their way.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.056
Dr. Evert?

39:21.318 --> 39:22.558
She must have known what
the Warden would do to her.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.355
Why didn't she get
out when she could?

39:24.613 --> 39:26.103
Why didn't you?

39:26.365 --> 39:28.105
She couldn't leave
her patients behind.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.356
You felt it.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.154
You were right.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.161
About everything.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.384
It's time.

39:57.646 --> 39:58.931
It's time?

40:00.190 --> 40:01.600
...US.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.068
ReaHy?

40:07.698 --> 40:09.984
I want to give
this a real shot.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.698
Be together.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.243
Life is too short.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.451
KENZI: Wait! The guards are...

40:22.713 --> 40:24.249
Gone.

40:25.549 --> 40:27.505
It's all over.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.919
Well, at least,
Bo looks... chipper.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.925
She looks happy.

40:50.157 --> 40:52.148
It just about killed me
denying you sanctuary.

40:52.409 --> 40:53.774
Well, that was
the plan, Gramps.

40:54.036 --> 40:56.994
Oh, don't call me that.
Makes me feel so old.

40:57.414 --> 40:59.575
So where is the
fine doc this evening?

40:59.833 --> 41:01.744
She is home, resting.

41:02.002 --> 41:03.037
I'm going to go
check on her later.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.502
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

41:05.756 --> 41:08.998
Oh, hey, Sylvie and her baby
made it to her mom's

41:09.259 --> 41:11.124
and they're going
to call him "Beau".

41:11.386 --> 41:12.136
ALL: Aww...

41:12.387 --> 41:15.254
BO: Oh!
And she sent pics.

41:15.515 --> 41:16.265
Bird.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.472
Bird boy.

41:18.727 --> 41:21.969
Wanblees... get cuter
after their first molting.

41:22.230 --> 41:23.845
BO: Well, even with
all those feathers,

41:24.107 --> 41:25.608
he'll have a better
upbringing than the Warden.

41:25.859 --> 41:28.100
The Amazons tossed him aside
but somehow, he survived.

41:28.362 --> 41:30.944
He still wanted
to be like them.

41:32.074 --> 41:35.032
All Hale The new Ash!

41:35.327 --> 41:38.160
See what I did there?
Hale-Ash.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.038
Never gets old.

41:39.289 --> 41:39.869
No, never.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.112
What's the latest on Hecuba?

41:41.375 --> 41:44.412
Well, I've pardoned all
but the most violent

41:44.670 --> 41:47.753
prisoners and shut it down.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.501
KENZI: Oh!
That's my man.

41:50.759 --> 41:54.092
You know, it's the first time
I've enjoyed being The Ash.

41:55.806 --> 41:56.841
Acting Ash.

41:57.099 --> 41:59.636
Acting like an Ash
you can be proud of.

42:00.102 --> 42:01.467
Hale! Wait up!

42:03.480 --> 42:04.435
Well...

42:04.856 --> 42:06.471
I am off to see my girlfriend.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.473
Best wishes
to both of you.

42:09.736 --> 42:10.691
Thank you.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.071
Are you really all right?

42:15.826 --> 42:17.862
You went through
a lot behind bars.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.735
No powers, no privacy.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.497
Like my mom.

42:21.915 --> 42:24.452
Hundreds of years,
being used by the Dark.

42:24.710 --> 42:26.541
The same way
that the Warden--

42:26.837 --> 42:28.247
What do you mean?

42:29.131 --> 42:33.215
My father was
most certainly Dark.

42:36.138 --> 42:38.129
But what if
he was a monster?

42:40.851 --> 42:42.466
What does that make me?

42:42.728 --> 42:44.514
You are a lot of things, Bo.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.727
But you're not a monster.
