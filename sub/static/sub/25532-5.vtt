WEBVTT

00:29.947 --> 00:34.326
Ruby, this is serious. We're supposed
to be studying each other's lips.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.537
I think yours are delicate and inviting.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.998
- Really?
- And Tillie's are soft, even to the eye.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.709
And Jane's are shaped like a rosebud
that's beginning to bloom.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.545
Mine are awful.

00:45.629 --> 00:48.298
Like the fat caterpillars
that live in our old willow tree.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.384
- They do look a bit swollen.
- It's my own fault.

00:50.467 --> 00:54.012
I have a terrible habit of chewing
on my bottom lip when I'm thinking.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.557
The trouble is that I'm always thinking.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.183
Are they unpleasant to look at?

00:58.267 --> 01:00.060
They are perfectly pink and luscious.

01:00.769 --> 01:05.774
Diana, you without a doubt have
the best, most kissable Cupid's bow.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.610
The brightest smile to light any heart.

01:09.528 --> 01:12.698
Do you think that Prissy
and Mr. Phillips have kissed?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.950
Not yet.

01:15.033 --> 01:18.036
But soon, I imagine.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.581
Prissy's studying
for her Queen's Academy entrance exams,

01:20.664 --> 01:23.750
and sometimes Mr. Phillips stops
by our house to give her extra help.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.963
Prissy is only two years older than us.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.216
I mean to have an official beau
by the time I'm 15.

01:31.300 --> 01:36.054
- I hope Gilbert will be back by then.
- You think of nothing but beaus, Ruby.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.181
Well, what's wrong with that?

01:38.265 --> 01:40.726
I've never even seen a real kiss before.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.769
My parents don't go in
for that kind of thing.

01:42.853 --> 01:47.316
I once overheard Mrs. Lynde
and her husband share a kiss.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.611
It sounded like a cow
dragging its hind hoof out of a swamp!

01:53.071 --> 01:56.575
If someone were to kiss me,
I'm afraid I would do something silly,

01:56.658 --> 01:59.995
or... forget to do something
I should do.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.041
What are the rules?
Why don't they teach kissing etiquette?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.002
We could make a game.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.590
To see who could conduct
the most romantic courtship.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.009
With brave knights,
and enchanted princesses,

02:14.092 --> 02:16.178
and sorcerers and desperadoes!

02:16.261 --> 02:18.221
It'd be great practice.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.557
Diana, you can play
the gallant young man.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.892
Oh...

02:23.977 --> 02:27.898
Prince Wisteria, wilt thou let fly
the Feather of Fortune

02:27.981 --> 02:30.901
and choose thy heart-pure maiden?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.361
I shall.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.292
Uh...

02:47.376 --> 02:48.377
Oh.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.886
What should I do, Diana?

02:57.969 --> 03:00.305
Tillie, you shouldn't talk
to Prince Wisteria

03:00.389 --> 03:02.307
as though he were our friend Diana.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.017
It spoils the effect.

03:07.396 --> 03:12.234
I-I'm waiting for my handsome
young prince to come and claim me.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.444
Ahem.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.946
Ahem.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.241
Why, who is this fair and noble maiden?

03:22.411 --> 03:24.121
Oh!

03:27.624 --> 03:30.001
- Why must the girl wait for the boy?
- What?

03:30.127 --> 03:31.753
- Anne!
- Are you mad?!

03:31.837 --> 03:34.840
If I wanted to kiss a boy,
couldn't I just... kiss him?

03:34.923 --> 03:37.592
No! Anne!

04:32.689 --> 04:36.026
What of you?
I like our change of plans, Doc.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.612
Canada. Excited to go.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.656
You're daring,
coming to this level of the deck.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.910
Fireman hears about you coming up here,
you can expect trouble.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.288
I can live down trouble.

04:48.371 --> 04:52.459
I want to see where I'm headed for once.
Feel the wind on my face.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.377
Avonlea ahead of me.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.131
Ten years on this ship humpin' coal.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.800
I earned this.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.929
Besides, what they going to do?
Sack me? Toss me overboard?

05:04.012 --> 05:06.848
Worst-case scenario, I get the latrine.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.184
If my choices were that or latrine duty,

05:09.267 --> 05:11.937
I might take my chances
with the Atlantic.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.940
Choices.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.526
I like that word.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.947
Things are going to change
startin' right now.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.741
Yeah.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.580
Have you ever noticed
what cheerful things brooks are?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.457
They're always laughing.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.125
- How sweet!
- Hello.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.961
Hello.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.421
Let's get 'em!

05:39.589 --> 05:41.716
- Ah!
- Bloomies! Knickers!

05:41.800 --> 05:44.511
Ah!

05:44.928 --> 05:45.971
Ah!

05:49.349 --> 05:51.142
No! Stop!

05:51.226 --> 05:53.895
- Look at Princess Cordelia now.
- We can see your bloomers.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.939
- Little scarecrow!
- No!

05:56.022 --> 06:00.193
Anne Shirley, you are the scrawniest,
homeliest red-haired freckled witch

06:00.277 --> 06:02.112
that ever lived.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.072
No one will ever want you.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.495
Keep your hands off!

06:10.579 --> 06:12.497
- Whoa.
- You mustn't mind them, Anne.

06:12.581 --> 06:16.126
They're just boys being boys.
They love to torment our lives out.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.254
I do mind. I mind a great deal.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.673
A skirt is not an invitation!

06:26.636 --> 06:29.014
Anne, are you alright?

06:32.601 --> 06:34.311
Yes.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.730
Oh, really?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.243
Quiet, all of you.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.413
Settle down, ev... eryone.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.252
I think Diana made
a very convincing prince.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.754
Me, too.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.174
I was going for daring, dashing,
and a little bit wicked.

07:04.257 --> 07:08.094
Well, who needs real boys
when we have Prince Wisteria?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.847
What are you talking about?

07:10.931 --> 07:13.934
Anne invited us over
for an afternoon of parlor games.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.727
All of you?

07:18.897 --> 07:21.316
Parlor games? Without boys?

07:21.399 --> 07:22.776
Fine for you.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.196
I'm far too mature
for such childish amusements.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.311
Billy.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.499
Prissy.

08:19.582 --> 08:24.004
Mother is so very pleased that you are
aiding and abetting my higher education.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.093
When you squeezed my hand in secret,

08:30.176 --> 08:33.263
I too felt it was a pity
we were not alone.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.855
Yes, well, um...

08:43.732 --> 08:45.358
I-I'd better...

08:46.276 --> 08:47.527
Of course.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.613
- I'm due at home.
- Hmm.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.742
See you tomorrow.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.005
Whomever the bottle points to...

09:07.088 --> 09:08.882
you are permitted to kiss.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.426
It needs to be boy, girl, boy, girl.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.511
Where does that leave Cole?

09:13.595 --> 09:16.556
Jane, go sit next to your dumb brother.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.559
Tillie, you're over there.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.188
And, Anne, switch places with Charlie.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.569
Billy doesn't know anything
about anything.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.404
I'm glad you're here.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.074
Didn't have much of a choice.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.077
Who would like to spin first?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.661
Diana!

09:39.245 --> 09:40.538
Uh...

09:55.345 --> 09:57.055
- Moody.
- Me?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.766
Now you have to kiss.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.227
On the mouth.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.568
Ahem.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.281
- Good afternoon, Moody.
- Good afternoon, Diana.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.075
I'm going to kiss you now.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.631
Your turn, Anne.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.551
I'm out.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.010
No way.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.637
Ugly orphan.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.806
<i>No one will ever want you.</i>

10:39.889 --> 10:41.766
What are you afraid of, Anne?

10:41.850 --> 10:45.436
I seem to recall you knowing a lot
about intimate relations.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.814
<i>You are the scrawniest,
homeliest,</i>

10:47.897 --> 10:50.024
<i>red-haired freckled witch
that ever lived.</i>

10:50.108 --> 10:52.569
You're from unfortunate circumstances.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.779
<i>No one will ever want you.</i>

10:54.863 --> 10:57.282
This can't be your first kiss.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.743
Squeak! Squeak!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.412
Squeak! Freak.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.457
Squeak! Freak!

11:08.751 --> 11:10.086
Anne?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.838
Ever been kissed...

11:12.672 --> 11:13.673
Anne?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.676
Ye...

11:17.343 --> 11:18.303
No!

11:24.100 --> 11:25.435
Anne!

11:31.024 --> 11:32.483
Anne!

11:33.234 --> 11:34.068
Anne.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.822
Why did you run, Anne?

11:37.906 --> 11:40.617
That Josie Pye! For someone
with such a lack of imagination,

11:40.700 --> 11:43.995
she certainly knows how to invent
cruel and unusual forms of torture!

11:44.078 --> 11:46.831
Why should I be forced to give
an expression of tenderness

11:46.915 --> 11:50.418
to indifferent or, in some cases,
repulsive persons?

11:50.919 --> 11:53.546
Billy wasn't very nice at all.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.007
I'm sorry he hurt your feelings.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.842
The whole thing
hurts everyone's feelings.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.261
It's not conducive!

12:00.345 --> 12:01.846
Con... ducive?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.474
To understanding anything about romance.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.941
Well, at least the snow is romantical.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.069
Just as I was leaving,
Moody pulled me aside

12:16.152 --> 12:18.655
and told me that my kiss
was like fresh butter.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.865
You have to admit
that's rather romantic.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.160
It's different for you, Diana,
because everyone wants to kiss you.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.623
- Hello, Miss Barry.
- Hello, Jerry.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.709
And she speaks French!
You are the complete package.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.671
Your dialect is very different
from classic French.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.339
Can you understand me okay?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.925
I understand that you are the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.261
Leave my friend alone, Jerry!

12:41.344 --> 12:44.764
It's fine, Anne. He said I'm the most
beautiful girl he's ever seen.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.934
Thank you, but you're very bold.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.108
What does it feel like
to be divinely beautiful, Diana?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.902
- That's very kind, but I'm not div...
- No, you are.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.989
Please answer the question.
I have to know.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.326
Compliments are nice...

13:05.410 --> 13:07.870
but... I'd rather be smart.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.925
What is the purpose of kissing?

13:26.014 --> 13:28.224
Is it... supposed to feel good?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.935
"With one long kiss
my whole soul through.

13:31.019 --> 13:34.814
My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew."
Tennyson.

13:34.897 --> 13:39.318
But kissing reminds me more of a...
mother bird feeding its baby.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.155
The thought... makes me queasy.

13:42.822 --> 13:47.035
And what is the perfect kiss?
Is it really sweeter than honey cake?

13:48.161 --> 13:51.748
And if a kiss is such a big idea,
then why is it such a small word?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.584
It should be long and difficult to say.
I've been trying to think

13:54.667 --> 13:57.503
of a more appropriate name for it,
but nothing gives me a thrill.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.672
I assume kissing
should give you a thrill,

13:59.756 --> 14:01.591
but I'm afraid I'll never find out.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.846
Do you think one can have a tragical
romance without ever being kissed?

14:16.355 --> 14:17.857
Well, now, um...

14:19.275 --> 14:20.193
I dunno.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.028
Have either of you ever kissed anyone?

14:26.699 --> 14:27.992
I...

14:28.576 --> 14:30.161
I should, uh... barn.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.208
For pity's sake, Anne, hold your tongue.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.253
- Show some propriety here at supper.
- Sorry.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.887
When would be a better time to ask?

14:51.516 --> 14:53.267
Some other time.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.330
- How was latrine duty, dear?
- Boy, haul you tail.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.791
Ugh!

15:16.874 --> 15:18.000
Argh!

15:18.459 --> 15:20.545
- Ugh!
- Still worth it.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.713
Have to make that hay
while the sun shine.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.925
- Ain't that what you farm boys say?
- You know what else they say?

15:26.008 --> 15:30.138
Don't put the cart before the horse.
This is gonna be a long few days.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.433
Lucky for me, I can't smell it anymore.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.643
Ugh.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.440
Ugh!

16:08.593 --> 16:11.220
Ah, isn't it good to be alive
on winter mornings like this?!

16:14.307 --> 16:16.767
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert!
Goodness gracious, what's happened here?

16:16.851 --> 16:18.227
It's decorative.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.190
For beauty's sake.
Even birds have pretty plumage, Marilla.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.317
Plumage, fiddlesticks.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.321
Take all that out of your hair at once.
You look ridiculous.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.365
Marilla, please, please,
let me wear them to school!

16:31.449 --> 16:34.494
For the land's sake, that's the last place
you want to wear them, believe me.

16:34.577 --> 16:38.080
I know you don't understand or imagine,
but if you had red hair,

16:38.164 --> 16:41.459
- you would want to cover it too!
- I do not condone unnecessary adornment.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.127
Off they come.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.547
Marilla, how can you be so unfeeling?

16:46.631 --> 16:48.090
Years of practice.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.344
Now, you know I always mean what I say.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.764
- But I need to be beautiful.
- Enough of this foolishness.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.016
You'll take them out at once.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.663
Ah! Ah.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.752
I wish I were a tree.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.506
Then I would have different hair
for every season.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.675
I would have pretty spring buds

17:30.758 --> 17:33.803
and a full head of blossoms in summer...

17:34.470 --> 17:37.557
vibrant autumn colors, and then...

17:42.979 --> 17:44.146
Never mind.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.694
- What do you think?
- Well...

17:50.570 --> 17:52.989
You hold your head with such an air.

17:54.699 --> 17:58.995
Here. If you don't mind,
I'd just make one or two adjustments.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.497
For balance. May I?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.717
Ooh, that'll look divine, Anne.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.721
- Um, Diana, could you...?
- Oh.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.944
Sorry everyone's staring at us.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.956
I didn't think Cole could do that.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.000
How I wish
we were doing recitations today,

18:46.083 --> 18:48.961
when appearance
is of paramount importance.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.923
Recitations...
are the purest form of torture.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.134
Torture?! You can't be serious.

18:55.217 --> 18:59.221
Standing up in front of a classroom,
everyone staring at me?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.807
- That's the whole joy of it!
- No joy at all.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.143
It's like being under a microscope.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.563
I just feel... too... tall,

19:07.647 --> 19:09.482
too seen, too...

19:11.776 --> 19:12.777
weird.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.489
Oh, it's beautiful, Cole!

19:16.572 --> 19:18.240
Ahem.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.660
Cole Mackenzie!

19:22.286 --> 19:25.373
Since you seem to have
such... feminine proclivities,

19:25.456 --> 19:28.167
we shall indulge your taste of it
this morning.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.045
You can sit with the girls.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.424
What?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.635
No, no...

20:06.664 --> 20:09.250
The egg goes in when it's off the heat.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.589
Can't believe you're sharing your
secret recipe after all these years.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.008
Nothing stays the same forever.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.511
I...

20:20.594 --> 20:24.181
I wonder if you might offer me
some advice, Rachel.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.101
I knew it.
As soon as you invited me over,

20:27.184 --> 20:30.646
"Something must be vexing Marilla.

20:30.730 --> 20:35.192
Since when does she need my help
making her own matchless plum puffs?"

20:35.276 --> 20:38.112
Children. They get older.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.406
Anne has started asking about...

20:40.489 --> 20:42.074
The dreaded questions.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.536
She is preoccupied with kissing,
of all things.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.500
I admit, I'm a woman
of narrow experience on this matter.

20:51.584 --> 20:55.129
You've certainly taken on
a great responsibility, Marilla.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.631
That Anne is full of original sin.

20:58.132 --> 21:01.260
A young girl shouldn't be asking
such questions.

21:01.343 --> 21:05.222
Let her know what's what.
"Spare the rod and spoil the child."

21:06.432 --> 21:08.517
- That's what I say.
- If I whacked the child

21:08.601 --> 21:10.770
every time she asked me
a slew of questions,

21:10.853 --> 21:13.647
- she'd be black and blue.
- She's an inquisitive little thing.

21:14.064 --> 21:17.443
And at this age, you have got
to lay down the ground rules,

21:17.526 --> 21:19.779
and lay them down hard.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.155
Over kissing?

21:21.238 --> 21:23.491
I've brought up ten children
and buried two,

21:23.574 --> 21:26.827
and they'd all testify
to the efficiency of my methods.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.370
- I've no doubt.
- Of course,

21:28.454 --> 21:31.791
folks that have raised children know
that you've got to expect the unexpected

21:31.874 --> 21:34.585
when it comes to flesh and blood.

21:34.668 --> 21:38.506
I recall a time I came home
to find my eldest, Thomas Jr.,

21:38.589 --> 21:40.591
setting fire to the drapes.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.469
Nothing a birch switch couldn't cure.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.473
Was that before or after
he burned down your shed?

21:58.484 --> 22:00.861
Rachel does have the effect
of making you want to do

22:00.945 --> 22:02.905
the complete opposite
of what she suggests.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.909
Would you stop that infernal racket?!
I can't hear myself think.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.040
I don't believe I could whip a child.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.502
But sometimes I think Anne is possessed.

22:17.461 --> 22:21.465
A moment ago she called turning 14
"a solemn occasion."

22:21.549 --> 22:23.968
And now it's this kissing business,

22:24.051 --> 22:26.262
tying bows in her hair,

22:26.345 --> 22:27.972
vain as a peacock.

22:28.055 --> 22:31.559
- What are we going to do about it?
- I promised you I wouldn't put my oar in.

22:31.642 --> 22:35.145
Well, I could use another oar now!
I'm rowing around in circles.

22:35.646 --> 22:37.523
Well, now...

22:37.606 --> 22:39.817
I don't see the harm
in her being curious.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.903
Matthew Cuthbert,
I don't understand you.

22:42.987 --> 22:46.323
I seem to remember...
with you and John Blythe...

22:47.408 --> 22:51.036
- Yes.
- Wasn't there a stolen kiss or two?

22:51.495 --> 22:52.538
How would you know?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.834
No one stole anything.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.421
What do you suggest?

23:01.964 --> 23:03.215
Well...

23:03.299 --> 23:06.468
I mean,
if we want to do right by Anne,

23:06.552 --> 23:09.847
I reckon that means
seeing that she has a fuller life...

23:11.515 --> 23:12.474
than us.

23:18.772 --> 23:19.982
Give...

23:21.692 --> 23:22.860
Gotcha.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.913
Mr. Phillips had no right
to insult you like that.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.166
I'm sorry you had to endure it.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.960
- It's fine.
- It's scandalous.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.545
He's never liked me.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.965
He doesn't seem to like anyone.
Except Prissy.

23:45.049 --> 23:49.970
You noticed that I always seem to get
detention for no other reason than I'm...

23:50.471 --> 23:51.347
What?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.099
You're what, Cole?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.434
Different.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.771
There's nothing wrong with different.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.857
I'm unusual, too.
And that's why we're kindred.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.277
- You're unique.
- I don't want to be unique.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.155
Unique means weird.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.990
I think it means...

24:10.074 --> 24:12.368
singular and extraordinary.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.536
Well, I'd rather be ordinary.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.582
I feel that way sometimes too.

24:19.208 --> 24:23.295
But an ordinary person
wouldn't be a brilliant artist.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.676
I'm not, but thanks.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.689
How was the beauty contest?

24:42.231 --> 24:44.316
I mean, school.

24:44.775 --> 24:47.152
Anne, what did I say about your hair?

24:47.236 --> 24:49.905
I know,
but my friend Cole styled it for me

24:49.988 --> 24:53.283
and did such a lovely job
that I just had to leave it.

24:53.367 --> 24:56.245
Perhaps one day
you'll grow into a style like that,

24:56.328 --> 24:59.498
but for now I'll thank you
to restore yourself to yourself.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.127
I know it's foolish to want
to be anything other than what I am,

25:03.210 --> 25:04.628
but I can't help it.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.922
I love... pretty things.

25:09.133 --> 25:13.262
Mm. I hate when I look in the glass
and I see something that isn't pretty.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.264
It makes me feel so sorrowful,

25:15.764 --> 25:19.101
just as I feel
when I see any ugly thing.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.061
I pity it because it's not beautiful.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.772
Well, I have something
that might cheer you up.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.735
We received a letter today.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.195
- From Gilbert Blythe.
- Oh! Oh, Marilla!

25:30.279 --> 25:32.865
I'd forgotten
about my foreign correspondence!

25:32.948 --> 25:37.494
Trinidad! I imagined that I was writing
to some far-flung corner of the world,

25:37.578 --> 25:39.621
but nowhere this intriguing.

25:40.372 --> 25:45.294
"Miss Anne Shirley-Cuthbert."
How wonderful! Look at that, Marilla!

25:45.377 --> 25:46.879
I saw.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.631
Do try to learn to take things calmly,
child.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.718
How can I be calm when I've never seen
my name written with "Miss" before?

25:53.177 --> 25:54.470
Well, open it.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.723
There's nothing romantical
about this letter, nothing whatsoever.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.476
You wrote to him about the gold,
as I recall.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.770
Yes, that's exactly right.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.813
I wonder what he said.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.322
Not returning to Avonlea?

26:13.405 --> 26:16.116
- "Indefinitely."
- When did he send it?

26:16.200 --> 26:19.119
It was posted three weeks ago
from Port of Spain,

26:19.203 --> 26:20.662
in Trinidad.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.584
You could write him back.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.337
With your knack for words,
I'm sure you could convince him.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.173
Well, considering "there's gold
in Avonlea" didn't change his mind

26:31.256 --> 26:33.217
almost makes me grateful
that there wasn't.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.427
Wouldn't it have been
a personal mortification

26:35.511 --> 26:37.638
if he had to leave
his exotic port-of-call?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.140
True enough.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.143
In that way I suppose
it's all worked out for the best.

26:43.227 --> 26:46.146
Besides, if I were to write him again,
which I most certainly won't,

26:46.230 --> 26:49.525
it would be to tell him
that there's no "A" in "indefinitely."

26:51.026 --> 26:54.446
Maybe that was on purpose.
Maybe he wants to be pen pals.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.532
If he's challenging me
to a long-distance duel,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.242
I will not engage.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.286
I believe he spelled that word wrong
last year. Engage.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.331
Engagement.
But I... I don't quite recall.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.503
Ruby will have an affliction.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.842
- Let's give this to her to keep.
- What? Why?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.052
For her to cry over?

27:18.720 --> 27:19.972
Unless...

27:20.764 --> 27:21.849
you don't want to.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.896
What's this?

27:29.022 --> 27:31.984
- "Dear Anne, it's very nice to hear..."
- Stop! Stop it! Just give it back!

27:32.067 --> 27:33.277
What am I...

27:35.487 --> 27:38.073
Ooh... what a gentleman.

27:42.411 --> 27:44.580
Pfft. Just more girl stuff.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.797
Why are you still here?!

28:48.143 --> 28:49.853
Oh! Ugh.

28:49.937 --> 28:53.273
- Boy, what you doing here?
- Fireman sure hates my singing.

28:53.357 --> 28:56.360
You got yourself in trouble
so you could come help me?

28:56.443 --> 28:58.987
Here. Hurry.
Put some of this under your nose.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.074
It'll help the smell. Allow me.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.662
One of our neighbors back home
is a pig farmer.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.747
Thyme.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.750
Trinidadian bush medicine?
Nice trick, Doc.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.503
- Self-preservation.
- We have a saying:

29:14.586 --> 29:17.506
"This plant don't ask to grow."
Thyme's hardy, yeah?

29:17.589 --> 29:20.384
Doesn't need minding.
Grows where other plants cannot.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.594
Hopefully like me, in Avonlea.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.389
Two more days.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.683
Still worth it?

29:28.267 --> 29:29.518
Get to work.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.144
Ugh.

29:32.312 --> 29:35.190
Ruby would only ruin it
with her tears anyway.

29:35.816 --> 29:40.112
And then she would cry again...
over having ruined it.

29:41.989 --> 29:44.866
It's better if I hold onto it...
for safety.

29:59.381 --> 30:02.301
I wonder if the other foxes
ever twit you about your hair.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.555
You're always alone.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.640
Don't you have a sweetheart?

30:12.436 --> 30:15.314
Maybe we're just meant
to be solitary creatures, you and I.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.320
Just so you know, you're very beautiful!

30:43.842 --> 30:46.386
Anne, before you go, a word.

30:46.470 --> 30:47.804
Yes, Marilla?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.849
You shouldn't dwell so much
on your looks, Anne.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.019
I assure you, it's better to be plain.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.105
If you're beautiful,
you get stuck on one path,

30:57.189 --> 30:59.608
and that's all that's expected of you.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.027
Whereas you'll be able
to go through life

31:02.110 --> 31:04.196
getting to be exactly who you are

31:04.279 --> 31:06.948
without calling too much attention
to yourself.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.245
It's a gift. Really.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.873
There are more important things
than beauty,

31:14.956 --> 31:17.376
and you'll have every opportunity
to find out.

31:36.311 --> 31:41.024
Prissy says that his mustache
was scratchy, not soft.

31:43.193 --> 31:46.113
What does Cole, peeking out of the coats
like that, remind you of?

31:48.073 --> 31:51.034
- I don't know.
- An owl tucked in the hollow of a tree.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.330
He's so dedicated to his art,
really cultivating his imagination.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.000
He's very handsome, isn't he?

31:59.084 --> 32:00.877
You can't like <i>all</i> the boys!

32:02.796 --> 32:04.256
Sad and handsome.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.883
The poor thing
could use some cheering up.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.848
Hello, Cole.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.727
I just wanted to say I think
it's too bad our game ended

32:17.811 --> 32:19.771
before you could have your turn.

32:24.568 --> 32:28.780
I suppose I could break the rules
and allow you to kiss me now.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.201
No, thanks.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.747
What's wrong with you?!
Don't you like girls or something?

32:37.831 --> 32:39.374
I don't like <i>you.</i>

32:43.670 --> 32:45.505
Cole is a freak!

32:45.589 --> 32:49.718
Josie Pye, you take that back!
Cole is my friend!

32:49.801 --> 32:51.761
Then it's a match made in heaven.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.985
Spin.

33:18.288 --> 33:21.124
I'm not kissing that ugly orphan.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.297
Arf-arf-arf-arf!

33:27.380 --> 33:32.219
Oh, when her face turns red,
it's like she's all red.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.478
- I'll kiss Anne.
- Oh, how splendid!

33:47.442 --> 33:49.486
Good. Let the freaks kiss.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.948
Freak!

33:54.074 --> 33:55.784
Kiss, freaks. Kiss.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.786
Little freak!

33:57.869 --> 33:59.579
What are you doing?!

34:02.707 --> 34:03.917
No!

34:04.000 --> 34:06.670
Freak!

34:08.045 --> 34:09.547
<i>- Kiss, freaks!
- Stop.</i>

34:09.630 --> 34:11.466
Kiss, freaks, kiss!

34:11.550 --> 34:13.842
- Kiss, freaks, kiss!
- Stop it!

34:13.927 --> 34:15.428
- Kiss, freaks, kiss!
- Stop!

34:15.512 --> 34:17.264
- Kiss, freaks, kiss!
- That's untoward!

34:17.347 --> 34:19.724
- Leave them alone!
- Stop being mean!

34:22.185 --> 34:23.812
- Billy!
- Kiss, freaks, kiss!

34:23.895 --> 34:25.813
Kiss, freaks, kiss!

34:25.897 --> 34:28.775
- Leave them alone!
- Kiss, freaks, kiss!

34:28.858 --> 34:31.194
Kiss, freaks, kiss!
Kiss, freaks, kiss!

34:31.277 --> 34:34.322
- Leave them alone!
- What are you waiting for?!

34:34.406 --> 34:37.409
- Leave them alone!
- Kiss, freaks, kiss!

34:40.745 --> 34:41.996
Ah!

34:51.672 --> 34:54.426
I've decided
I'm not going to do anymore kissing.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.177
Not unless I want to.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.348
Of course, if I wasn't so homely,
I would have more options.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.350
You're not homely, Anne.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.353
I wish you'd stop saying that.
It's not true.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.107
Diana, it is my firm belief
that my life would be easier

35:09.190 --> 35:12.068
if I was beautiful like you.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.570
Nonsense!

35:14.613 --> 35:17.449
I'd trade my dimples
for any of your cleverness

35:17.532 --> 35:19.993
and consider it cheaply bought
at that price.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.412
Diana, I'm so glad you're exquisite.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.750
Next to being beautiful oneself...

35:26.833 --> 35:29.002
it's best to have
a beautiful bosom friend.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.482
Mwah.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.984
Mwah! Mwah!

36:02.160 --> 36:05.955
Hello there again,
Miss Anne of Green Gables.

36:06.748 --> 36:07.791
Hello.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.543
What is wrong, little bird?

36:10.627 --> 36:13.463
You wouldn't happen to have anything
in that wonderful case

36:13.546 --> 36:15.674
that would make me beautiful, would you?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.717
Perhaps a remedy
to remove my horrible freckles

36:17.801 --> 36:20.428
and give me a rose-leaf complexion?

36:20.512 --> 36:23.056
Or lovely, starry, violet eyes?

36:23.139 --> 36:24.391
Hmm.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.309
Hmm...

36:27.602 --> 36:29.229
Hmm. No.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.523
I'm afraid not.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.191
- Hmm.
- What's that?

36:34.401 --> 36:36.319
Hair dye?! Do you...

36:36.403 --> 36:39.072
Do you think this will turn my hair
a beautiful raven black?

36:39.155 --> 36:40.740
That's what it say.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.535
My red hair is the bane of my existence.

36:43.618 --> 36:46.413
And raven hair is my life-long dream.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.289
Still no money?

36:50.625 --> 36:53.586
Uh... I have a sandwich.

36:54.337 --> 36:55.171
Ham.

36:55.672 --> 36:56.506
Cheese.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.676
- Instructions are on the label.
- Oh!

37:02.220 --> 37:04.889
Ah... thank you!

37:43.595 --> 37:45.889
Thank you.

38:06.201 --> 38:09.204
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home to you too.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.288
Oof.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.711
The, uh, kinds of feelings...

38:18.505 --> 38:20.215
The, uh...

38:20.298 --> 38:24.636
the, uh... emotions
consequent on the first kiss

38:24.719 --> 38:27.222
can be... unsettling,

38:27.305 --> 38:29.432
and... Yeah, yeah...

38:29.516 --> 38:33.394
sometimes as... as we get a bit older...

38:34.229 --> 38:35.480
they can...

38:38.316 --> 38:41.319
Anne? I'm back from Rachel's.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.240
The...

38:46.157 --> 38:49.244
The expression of a certain passion...

38:49.828 --> 38:50.662
No.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.164
The...

38:53.915 --> 38:55.834
expression of a certain feeling...

38:57.335 --> 38:58.753
Anne?

38:59.379 --> 39:02.257
Intuition, our own selfhood,

39:02.340 --> 39:04.175
nature's highest teacher...

39:05.343 --> 39:09.806
Anne? I dare say I'm prepared
to settle your questions now.

39:11.349 --> 39:16.104
Kissing is a natural expression of love
and its emotions...

39:16.187 --> 39:18.439
Mercy me. Have you been sleeping?

39:18.857 --> 39:21.234
- Anne!
- No.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.820
- Are you ill?
- No, but...

39:23.903 --> 39:26.781
please, I'm in the depths of despair.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.284
Please, Marilla,
go away and don't look at me!

39:29.367 --> 39:32.787
Did anyone ever hear the like?
Whatever is the matter with you?

39:32.871 --> 39:36.374
Get up right this minute and tell me.
This minute, I say.

39:40.461 --> 39:43.882
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert,
what have you done to your hair?!

39:45.466 --> 39:47.135
Why, it's green!

39:50.597 --> 39:52.056
- Ow.
- The more you squirm,

39:52.140 --> 39:54.601
the longer these ringlets will take,
pretty miss.

39:55.351 --> 39:59.230
Would it be so terrible
if I didn't have curls tomorrow?

39:59.314 --> 40:01.566
Beauty is power, darling.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.234
You know that.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.320
Yes?

40:05.403 --> 40:06.613
Yes.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.699
There. Now get some sleep.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.910
You look tired, and that won't do.

40:19.042 --> 40:22.337
Oh, Marilla, you little know
how utterly wretched I am!

40:22.420 --> 40:25.840
I'm the unhappiest girl
in Prince Edward Island.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.761
Well, if I'd decided it was worthwhile
to dye my hair,

40:29.844 --> 40:31.971
I'd have dyed it
a decent color at least.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.223
But I didn't mean to dye it green!

40:34.307 --> 40:36.225
I applied the dye
as the directions said.

40:36.309 --> 40:38.561
I used up the whole bottle, and...
oh, Marilla,

40:38.645 --> 40:41.981
it was like I'd been bewitched.
When I saw myself with raven hair,

40:42.065 --> 40:45.193
I didn't want anything more
than to look like myself again!

40:45.276 --> 40:47.987
I looked like a demon possessed!

40:48.071 --> 40:51.532
I tried and I tried to wash it off,
but it wouldn't come out. I...

40:51.616 --> 40:54.577
I thought maybe laundry bluing
would... would strip it out!

40:54.661 --> 40:57.205
Well, that explains it.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.165
Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?

40:59.248 --> 41:03.419
I can never, never live this down.
People have pretty well forgotten

41:03.503 --> 41:06.381
my other mistakes,
but they'll never forget this!

41:06.464 --> 41:10.093
They'll think I'm not respectable.
Oh, Marilla,

41:10.176 --> 41:14.806
"what a tangled web we weave
when first we practice to deceive."

41:14.889 --> 41:17.392
And that is poetry, but it is true.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.812
And, oh, how Josie Pye will laugh.

41:20.895 --> 41:24.357
Oh, Marilla, I can't face Josie Pye.
I just can't!

41:24.440 --> 41:29.362
Well, I hope you've got your eyes opened
as to where vanity leads you, Anne.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.333
I'll never, never look at myself again.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.839
Yes, I will, too.
I'll do penance for being wicked.

41:47.922 --> 41:52.260
And I'll look at myself every time I come
into my room and see how ugly I am.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.388
And I won't try to imagine it away,
either.

41:56.597 --> 41:57.890
Henceforth...

41:58.599 --> 42:01.936
my kiss will sit
on my lips for all of eternity

42:02.020 --> 42:04.981
like a rose that longs to be plucked,
but never will.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.443
Now, now.

42:09.277 --> 42:12.071
I reckon beauty doesn't enter into it.

42:12.530 --> 42:16.617
When someone loves you, Anne...
then you'll be kissed.

42:17.744 --> 42:22.206
Marilla, Marilla,
say those blessed words again?

42:22.290 --> 42:24.292
I guess once is enough to say them.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.544
Now, are you ready?

42:29.964 --> 42:32.967
Oh, please cut it off at once
and have it over!

42:33.051 --> 42:35.344
Oh, I feel as if my heart is broken.

42:35.428 --> 42:38.097
I'm going to weep all the time
that you are cutting,

42:38.181 --> 42:39.682
if that won't interfere.

42:39.766 --> 42:42.560
This is such an unromantic affliction.
