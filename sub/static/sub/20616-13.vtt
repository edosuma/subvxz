00:10.478 --> 00:13.011
It's all about revenge,

00:13.013 --> 00:15.247
revenge against people.

00:17.051 --> 00:20.419
I really think it's
going to kill one us.

00:20.421 --> 00:24.022
He's going to hit somebody,
push somebody, scratch somebody.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.259
I have had scratches
from my neck

00:27.261 --> 00:29.795
down to my back.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.063
"I'll kill you.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.665
I'll take you away
from everything you love."

00:33.667 --> 00:37.002
I think this thing
wants me dead.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.338
Their life source is being
sucked out of them,

00:39.340 --> 00:41.206
and they're turning
into mummies.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.443
This is not a good situation.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.311
My name is Amy Allan.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.913
There's death here.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.648
Don't wanna go down there.

00:49.650 --> 00:50.916
I see dead people.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.018
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.687
I speak to dead people...

00:55.689 --> 00:58.490
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.292
...and they speak to me.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.461
She's going to torture them.

01:02.463 --> 01:06.265
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.400
They were all murdered.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.902
I rely on my partner.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.470
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.272
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.974
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:15.976 --> 01:19.545
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.382
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.083
It's my job to reveal them.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.718
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.887
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:28.889 --> 01:30.923
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.157
...until the very end.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.792
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.861
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:35.863 --> 01:37.362
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.031
Or time to get out.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.033
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:55.049 --> 01:57.115
I'm up here
in Grant Township, Michigan.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.218
It's about 70 miles north
of Detroit.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.986
I got a call from a woman
named Rene.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.121
Now, she and her husband
have been kicked,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.123
scratched, choked...

02:05.125 --> 02:07.125
You name it,
they've got through it.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.094
She says it's tearing
her family apart,

02:09.096 --> 02:10.996
and she desperately
needs our help.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.100
Before Amy arrives,

02:15.102 --> 02:17.569
I have to remove
any leading information.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.005
This home has a lot
of antique portraits,

02:20.007 --> 02:23.475
personal items,
and religious symbols,

02:23.477 --> 02:26.311
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.748
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:42.062 --> 02:46.965
The first thing is, like,
an earth, elemental thing.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.934
It's angry and vengeful.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.437
I think it's something that was
originally part of the Earth,

02:52.439 --> 02:57.743
and then it split off
and is now just kind of evil.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.147
It's all about revenge,

03:02.149 --> 03:05.417
revenge against people.

03:12.126 --> 03:15.827
So, Rene, when we were
talking on the phone, um,

03:15.829 --> 03:17.429
it sounded like you were
going through hell here.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.698
We are living in hell.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.569
It's attacking myself,
my husband,

03:23.571 --> 03:26.171
and if we don't get help
to reclaim our house,

03:26.173 --> 03:27.773
reclaim our lives,

03:27.775 --> 03:31.677
I really think it's gonna
kill one of us.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.445
I believe it's evil.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.713
How long have you lived
in the house?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.348
Three and a half years.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.284
My sister actually bought
the house for my husband and I

03:39.286 --> 03:42.888
so the family could be
close together.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.456
So, Rene, who lives
in the house?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.991
It's me, my husband,

03:45.993 --> 03:48.927
and a family friend
lives with us also.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.796
Is everybody in the house
being affected?

03:50.798 --> 03:53.565
Everybody in the house
is being affected,

03:53.567 --> 03:58.503
but it seems to be mostly
directed at my husband.

03:58.505 --> 03:59.671
So why do you think that is?

03:59.673 --> 04:03.508
Because Edward had
a really rough childhood,

04:03.510 --> 04:08.380
and he's vulnerable
because he's bipolar.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.549
If you can, give me a list
of what's going on here.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.985
Well, we hear voices.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.487
We're seeing shadow figures,

04:15.489 --> 04:18.957
and we've been having
physical attacks,

04:18.959 --> 04:21.293
and our health is declining.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.128
What's the worst
health issue for you?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.230
Complete lethargy,

04:25.232 --> 04:27.199
like someone's
just taken my energy

04:27.201 --> 04:29.234
and wants to live off
what I have.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.937
All right, so what do you think
whatever's in this house wants?

04:31.939 --> 04:36.541
I think it just wants
to kill, destroy.

04:36.543 --> 04:40.212
Tell me how
I can fight and win.

04:40.214 --> 04:42.447
I want to win.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.450
There's
this one person here,

04:45.452 --> 04:46.685
a dead dude,

04:46.687 --> 04:50.656
who's psycho
and causing problems.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.325
He looks like a preacher
or a pastor.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.694
He's really bad.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.430
He says, "I'm gonna kill you,
and I'm gonna make you

04:58.432 --> 05:01.099
"...feel the pain of, like,

05:01.101 --> 05:04.803
saying goodbye
to all of your loved ones."

05:11.011 --> 05:13.045
So, Rene, I know you're worried
about your husband Edward,

05:13.047 --> 05:14.212
but what about you?

05:14.214 --> 05:15.547
What experiences are
you having?

05:15.549 --> 05:18.684
Things break here
all the time,

05:18.686 --> 05:21.720
and there's no explanation.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.754
Now, you got animals
in the house.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.056
Are you sure
it wasn't them?

05:24.058 --> 05:28.460
This was happening before
we even got the animals.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.062
Okay. Anything else?

05:30.064 --> 05:34.766
Well, my animals have died
without explanation.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.835
So obviously, like me,
you're an animal lover.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.170
What do you have here?

05:38.172 --> 05:42.074
We have dogs. We have cats.
We have chickens.

05:42.076 --> 05:46.078
We have a couple pigs,
a sheep, and goats.

05:46.080 --> 05:51.316
If we show any kind of love,

05:51.318 --> 05:54.419
- this house, it -- it...
- it will know.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.890
- It will be dead.
- I'm sorry.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.626
That's okay.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.161
Okay. Anything else?

06:03.163 --> 06:07.132
Well, I seen a shadow man
walk across the kitchen.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.701
Is it something that has a shape
to it, or is it just...

06:09.703 --> 06:12.637
He has a shape
like Abraham Lincoln.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.241
How often do you see this?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.810
We all see it quite a bit.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.146
All this stuff going on,
how are you dealing with it?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.981
People
don't really understand.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.184
And you're supposed
to be safe in your house.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.688
It's supposed
to be your comfort zone.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.294
Come here. You'll be all right.
Don't worry about it.

06:36.296 --> 06:39.030
- We'll fix this, okay?
- Okay.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.304
I'm seeing
a shadow figure in there.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.140
I think it's the pastor dude.

06:48.142 --> 06:51.343
I think the living see him
as a shadow,

06:51.345 --> 06:52.611
so he's like,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.980
"I want to show you.
Like, look a what I can do.

06:54.982 --> 06:59.017
"I can be, you know, project
these images and...with people."

06:59.019 --> 07:02.120
He's reading their minds.
This is what scares them.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.990
Like, he's even, like,
like, challenging me.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.859
"I'll kill you. I'll take you
away from everything you love."

07:13.700 --> 07:15.567
Okay, Rene, so what's
going on up here?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.536
I've seen an apparition
of a woman

07:17.538 --> 07:19.738
sitting on my bed
right there,

07:19.740 --> 07:22.674
and she just sat down...

07:22.676 --> 07:23.742
On the edge here?

07:23.744 --> 07:29.047
...right here,
and just stared at me.

07:29.049 --> 07:32.717
Her hair was
in a disheveled bun,

07:32.719 --> 07:36.388
but she had huge teeth.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.756
All right. So anything else?

07:37.758 --> 07:41.193
I sometimes get the sensation
as if I'm being choked.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.261
Okay. So can you
describe it for me?

07:43.263 --> 07:46.898
It's like somebody
is taking their fingers

07:46.900 --> 07:48.934
and shoving them
down my throat.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.269
Anything else physical like that
ever happened to you?

07:51.271 --> 07:52.437
Yes.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.840
There have been a couple
of times that I woke up,

07:54.842 --> 07:58.810
and when I woke up, I felt as
if I'd been punched in the face.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.680
So I gotta ask, how the hell
are you sleeping

08:01.682 --> 08:04.349
with all of this going on?
- Well, I barely sleep.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.884
When I do lay down to sleep,

08:05.886 --> 08:09.955
I'm just overwhelmed with
all kinds of negative thoughts.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.157
Me being hurt in car cashes.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.793
People leaving me, and people
saying that they hate me,

08:14.795 --> 08:17.929
just feeling abandoned
all the time.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.397
What the hell
you still doing here?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.634
Well, I believe my God is
stronger, so I'm gonna fight.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.737
I won't let it get to the point
where it kills my husband.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.473
- Okay.
- I know that Jesus can win.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.208
I know Amy can win.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.780
It's not good up here.
Mnh-mnh, no.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.215
It's really bad up here.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.984
I don't know how...any living
person would come up here.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.356
The pastor, this is his area.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.825
The living people here,
I think he tortures them.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.093
How?

08:48.095 --> 08:51.229
With nightmares, going, like,
into their dreams.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.369
He is literally
in their mind, doing this.

08:57.371 --> 09:02.874
I think that
he would be capable of...

09:02.876 --> 09:05.844
harming living people up here.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.913
If he's gonna do anything,
he's gonna hit somebody,

09:07.915 --> 09:09.915
push somebody, scratch somebody.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.418
You know what I'm saying?
So this is not good.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.925
So, Patricia, I understand
you're Rene's sister,

09:36.927 --> 09:39.361
and you actually bought this
house for her and Edward, right?

09:39.363 --> 09:40.528
Yes.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.431
I feel really guilty
because I brought them

09:43.433 --> 09:45.400
to a place where it's dark.

09:45.402 --> 09:47.435
So what about you, Patricia?
Any experiences?

09:47.437 --> 09:49.137
- Yes.
- Okay.

09:49.139 --> 09:53.341
In the hallway,
I saw a shadow figure,

09:53.343 --> 09:54.909
and I thought it was Eddie,

09:54.911 --> 09:57.212
but come to find out,
he was sound asleep in the bed,

09:57.214 --> 09:59.547
and there was nobody
in the hallway.

09:59.549 --> 10:01.549
Talking to Rene, she's pretty
convinced that whatever is here

10:01.551 --> 10:03.251
is trying to kill
or really hurt Edward.

10:03.253 --> 10:05.186
- Do you agree with that?
- Yeah.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.855
Eddie is very vulnerable,

10:06.857 --> 10:10.759
and his history with
his family is horrific.

10:10.761 --> 10:12.394
It attacks the vulnerable.

10:16.133 --> 10:19.300
This pastor is like, "I can
do this. This is my domain.

10:19.302 --> 10:20.568
I can do this."

10:20.570 --> 10:21.903
You know, he's like,
"I can be everywhere,

10:21.905 --> 10:24.339
and I can be nowhere,"
and I do think he can.

10:26.910 --> 10:28.977
He goes, "I see their fears."

10:28.979 --> 10:30.678
This shadow person
that I saw here,

10:30.680 --> 10:34.749
sitting here, it looked like,
almost like a man.

10:34.751 --> 10:37.018
It's something familiar
to the living people here.

10:37.020 --> 10:40.021
That it would be like...
"That's so-and-so,"

10:40.023 --> 10:44.592
and somehow slightly familiar
where it's disturbing.

10:44.594 --> 10:47.262
He likes to...
twist that knife.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.468
So, Edward, I was talking
to your wife, Rene,

10:53.470 --> 10:54.803
and she was telling me

10:54.805 --> 10:56.271
that she thinks you're,
like, the target here.

10:56.273 --> 10:59.240
- I mean, do you agree with that?
- Yes, I do.

10:59.242 --> 11:04.212
I think that whatever is here
is focusing in on me.

11:04.214 --> 11:06.047
So tell me
about your experiences.

11:06.049 --> 11:07.749
What have you had?

11:07.751 --> 11:10.718
I've seen shadow figures
in our bathroom,

11:10.720 --> 11:12.954
blocked out the window
for half a second,

11:12.956 --> 11:16.024
and I thought, "What
in the world was that?"

11:16.026 --> 11:17.959
Sure it couldn't have been
maybe a car going by

11:17.961 --> 11:19.527
or somebody walking
along the road?

11:19.529 --> 11:21.796
No. No way.

11:21.798 --> 11:23.531
Our windows are very high up,

11:23.533 --> 11:26.201
so it's not like
it was somebody outside

11:26.203 --> 11:27.769
that had passed the window.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.471
Okay.
What else is going on?

11:29.473 --> 11:32.040
I have been
physically attacked.

11:32.042 --> 11:35.343
I have had scratches
from my neck down

11:35.345 --> 11:37.278
to my back and bruises.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.880
What kind of bruises?

11:38.882 --> 11:42.550
I would wake up, on my legs,
big bruises,

11:42.552 --> 11:45.553
and not have a clue
as to where they come from.

11:45.555 --> 11:47.856
Gone to the doctor's
about this?
Yeah. Yeah.

11:47.858 --> 11:50.458
And he says,
"You're healthy as a horse."

11:50.460 --> 11:52.360
Anything else going on
as far as physical attacks?

11:52.362 --> 11:56.264
One time, I was walking
through my kitchen.

11:56.266 --> 11:59.067
It felt like I got
kicked in the stomach,

11:59.069 --> 12:03.905
and I flew back about 15 feet
and hit my head on the table,

12:03.907 --> 12:07.108
and just about
knocked myself out.

12:07.110 --> 12:08.443
You could've been killed.

12:08.445 --> 12:10.845
I'm afraid for my life
in this house.

12:10.847 --> 12:13.481
I feel very confined,
just, like,

12:13.483 --> 12:16.651
something is just
around me all the time

12:16.653 --> 12:19.087
and won't leave me.

12:20.257 --> 12:21.589
This pastor,

12:21.591 --> 12:24.292
now he's showing me
more the image of him --

12:24.294 --> 12:26.427
cape, hat,

12:26.429 --> 12:28.463
very tall,

12:28.465 --> 12:31.866
covering the, lights,

12:31.868 --> 12:33.801
end of the hall.

12:35.539 --> 12:37.238
So I'm thinking that
this is an image

12:37.240 --> 12:40.174
that this person would see.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.912
This living person feels
trapped by

12:43.914 --> 12:46.214
this -- this presence.

12:46.216 --> 12:49.918
Interesting that as soon as
I try to tap the living here,

12:49.920 --> 12:52.820
I'm having issues.

12:52.822 --> 12:56.558
Something important out there.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.993
They don't want me to see it.

12:58.995 --> 13:02.263
I feel like it's still, like,
a living person

13:02.265 --> 13:05.199
that doesn't want me to...

13:05.201 --> 13:08.570
deal with that
or see that or something.

13:08.572 --> 13:10.572
This is something personal,

13:10.574 --> 13:12.440
something they're
connected with.

13:12.442 --> 13:15.276
It's something they
don't want...

13:15.278 --> 13:17.278
Maybe their emotional issues.

13:19.482 --> 13:21.983
Rene explained that you had
some mental issues

13:21.985 --> 13:24.385
from a tough childhood.
- Yeah.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.188
My mother
was clinically insane.

13:27.190 --> 13:30.224
I was put in the orphanage
at the age of 1.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.861
I didn't get adopted
until I was 9 years old.

13:33.863 --> 13:36.564
My father,
he murdered my brothers.

13:38.535 --> 13:43.871
They were 23 months old,
started the house on fire.

13:43.873 --> 13:46.808
You're breaking my heart,
listening to this story.

13:46.810 --> 13:49.377
Do you think because of
your traumatic background

13:49.379 --> 13:51.579
that you're vulnerable?

13:51.581 --> 13:53.514
Yes, I do,

13:53.516 --> 13:57.318
and I think this thing
attacks the vulnerable.

13:57.320 --> 14:00.088
So would you say that
your mental state

14:00.090 --> 14:02.223
has really deteriorated more
since you moved in here?

14:02.225 --> 14:04.659
- Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
- Okay.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.429
It makes me sick.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.099
This house -- I've gotten,
just for no reason,

14:11.101 --> 14:13.368
I'll run to the bathroom
and get sick.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.269
What do you think
whatever here wants?

14:15.271 --> 14:18.740
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

14:18.742 --> 14:21.042
I think this thing
wants me dead.

14:23.413 --> 14:27.582
This elemental thing
I saw earlier is bad news.

14:27.584 --> 14:32.820
It makes people sick
and it makes people angry.

14:32.822 --> 14:37.525
Damn. And it -- it --
it causes, um, anxiety.

14:37.527 --> 14:40.495
That thing makes them
more vulnerable.

14:40.497 --> 14:43.064
It wants to kill
a living person here.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.066
One thing it kept
showing me was, like,

14:45.068 --> 14:48.403
sacrificing someone
in the house.

15:01.925 --> 15:04.926
So my old friend and author
T.J. Gaffney called me

15:04.928 --> 15:06.261
when he heard I was in town

15:06.263 --> 15:08.430
investigating
Rene and Edward's house.

15:08.432 --> 15:10.065
Now he did some digging for me

15:10.067 --> 15:12.968
and says one of the original
owners of the property

15:12.970 --> 15:16.405
had nothing but years
of death and bad luck.

15:21.512 --> 15:23.078
Well, T.J., it's good
to see you again.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.380
You mentioned on the phone that
this Balmer family had nothing

15:25.382 --> 15:27.549
but bad luck when they got
on my clients' property,

15:27.551 --> 15:29.284
but before we get to that,
who are these people,

15:29.286 --> 15:30.652
and when did they get there?

15:30.654 --> 15:32.721
Well, Alexander Balmer
is a Scottish immigrant

15:32.723 --> 15:35.090
who moves to the area
in 1851.

15:35.092 --> 15:36.458
Okay.

15:36.460 --> 15:39.628
He buys 80 acres that includes
your clients' property,

15:39.630 --> 15:42.464
and they move into
and build a log cabin,

15:42.466 --> 15:44.633
just like the one
we see over here,

15:44.635 --> 15:49.037
with his wife Isabella
and 12 kids.

15:49.039 --> 15:51.473
- In -- in a cabin that size?
- In a cabin that size.

15:51.475 --> 15:53.175
What do they do
with the property?

15:53.177 --> 15:55.377
Well, he's a farmer,
and as you know, back then,

15:55.379 --> 15:57.012
farming was a tough life.

15:57.014 --> 16:01.783
Alexander passes away in 1887
at the age of 84,

16:01.785 --> 16:04.820
and it all starts to go
downhill from there.

16:04.822 --> 16:06.421
What happens with the farm?

16:06.423 --> 16:08.590
Well, it passes
to his son Andrew.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.425
And how does it go for him?

16:10.427 --> 16:11.827
Well, not well.

16:11.829 --> 16:15.797
About 3 years later, his mom
passes away on the farm as well.

16:15.799 --> 16:17.966
Okay, so do we know
what she dies from?

16:17.968 --> 16:19.401
Unfortunately not.

16:19.403 --> 16:21.970
There's no death record
that we've been able to find.

16:21.972 --> 16:23.672
He's got the property.

16:23.674 --> 16:25.907
Both the parents are gone,
so it's his free and clear.

16:25.909 --> 16:27.409
Well, not totally.

16:27.411 --> 16:30.145
He's got three spinster sisters
he's got to take care of.

16:30.147 --> 16:32.380
It's so bad for him
that he never marries,

16:32.382 --> 16:34.683
never gets to start
a family of his own.

16:38.255 --> 16:42.524
I'm getting
so much loss and sadness.

16:42.526 --> 16:45.494
I saw bunches of dead bodies.

16:48.532 --> 16:52.434
I think it has something to do
with this elemental thing.

16:52.436 --> 16:53.768
What does it look like?

16:53.770 --> 16:56.538
Like a cross between

16:56.540 --> 16:59.274
an insect, a snake,

16:59.276 --> 17:02.711
and a tree.

17:02.713 --> 17:05.347
I think it doesn't like
living people.

17:05.348 --> 17:06.714
The other thing
it showed me is that

17:06.717 --> 17:09.150
it can make minis of itself,

17:09.152 --> 17:14.222
and these smaller beings can
be dispatched to do...

17:14.223 --> 17:15.924
bad things,

17:15.925 --> 17:18.894
I'm thinking to the living,
to make them leave.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.498
All right.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.099
So Andrew is there with his
three spinster sisters,

17:25.102 --> 17:27.469
and he's got the farm.
I mean, what happens now?

17:27.471 --> 17:29.804
Well, in 1913, we get
one of the biggest storms

17:29.806 --> 17:32.741
to ever hit the state.
- Okay.

17:32.743 --> 17:36.444
It was so devastating that
the farm never really recovers.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.046
So what happens after that?

17:38.048 --> 17:39.748
Well, one of
the sisters, Janet,

17:39.750 --> 17:43.652
ends up passing later that year
of an abdominal aneurysm.

17:43.654 --> 17:44.920
All right,
says here she was 71.

17:44.922 --> 17:47.255
- Did she die on the property?
- Yes.

17:47.257 --> 17:48.523
What happens with
the other two sisters?

17:48.525 --> 17:51.993
Isabell ends up passing away
3 years after that.

17:51.995 --> 17:55.797
She ends up dying from,
an intestinal cancer,

17:55.799 --> 17:58.166
and again, she passes away
on the property.

17:58.168 --> 17:59.434
Okay, so there's
one sister left.

17:59.436 --> 18:00.802
Does he just cut his losses

18:00.804 --> 18:03.371
and sell the property
with his sister and move on?

18:03.373 --> 18:06.474
Nope. He stays on the property
right until the end of his life,

18:06.476 --> 18:10.645
passes away in 1928 from
pneumonia, also on the property.

18:10.647 --> 18:11.813
You weren't kidding
when you said

18:11.815 --> 18:13.315
their family had
a lot of bad luck.

18:13.317 --> 18:14.482
It seems like every time,
you know,

18:14.484 --> 18:15.650
they started to get ahead

18:15.652 --> 18:18.386
or were moving
in a positive direction,

18:18.388 --> 18:20.455
something negative
happens to 'em.

18:24.194 --> 18:27.128
The elemental thing lives
in this tree.

18:27.130 --> 18:29.497
It's impacting
the living directly.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.565
How?

18:30.567 --> 18:33.668
I hear, "Break things.
Make it hard."

18:33.670 --> 18:35.604
Things will go horribly wrong,

18:35.606 --> 18:38.239
like, you know,
the sewer system went.

18:38.241 --> 18:40.875
Not only did that happen,
but also the car broke.

18:40.877 --> 18:46.081
And not only did that happen,
but also all the TVs exploded.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.651
It's obviously impeding
their lives. It's that bad.

18:49.653 --> 18:50.986
Why is it doing this?

18:50.988 --> 18:53.355
It's saying that the living
started this,

18:53.357 --> 18:56.157
and now it's acting on...

18:56.159 --> 18:58.693
this revenge.

19:01.131 --> 19:02.831
So before
I even got into town,

19:02.833 --> 19:04.499
I reached out to
a local genealogist

19:04.501 --> 19:06.701
and had him start looking
for the property's history.

19:06.703 --> 19:10.805
Now, he just called back
and said, "In the last 50 years,

19:10.807 --> 19:13.308
"four people have died
on Rene and Edward's property,

19:13.310 --> 19:16.011
and two of 'em, way too young."

19:20.417 --> 19:22.550
Well, Walt, it's good
to see you again.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.386
You mentioned on the phone
there were four deaths

19:24.388 --> 19:26.788
in about 50 years in connection
with my clients' property.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.823
- Yes.
- What's the first one?

19:28.825 --> 19:31.826
Well, it was a young couple,
John and Barbara Grimm.

19:31.828 --> 19:34.763
They bought
the property in 1963.

19:34.765 --> 19:40.602
Tragically, in 1967, Barbara was
diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

19:40.604 --> 19:44.139
Two weeks after the diagnosis,
she died in the hospital.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.741
She was only 43 years old.

19:46.743 --> 19:48.476
Okay, so what happened
to the husband?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.812
He started drinking heavily,

19:50.814 --> 19:56.351
and five years after her death,
in 1972, he sold the property.

19:56.353 --> 19:58.620
Three years after that,
tragically,

19:58.622 --> 20:01.089
he died of
cirrhosis of the liver.

20:01.091 --> 20:03.191
He was only 55 years old.

20:03.193 --> 20:04.993
So that's two
pretty young, sad deaths.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.261
What about the other two?

20:06.263 --> 20:09.030
The third death was a homemaker,
Marguerite Girardi.

20:09.032 --> 20:14.302
She died in 1999 of
a heart attack on the property.

20:14.304 --> 20:17.505
She was 67 years old.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.240
All right.
So what about the fourth one?

20:19.242 --> 20:21.476
The fourth was
a World War II veteran,

20:21.478 --> 20:22.977
Chester Ulrich.

20:22.979 --> 20:26.081
He had bought
the property in 2002,

20:26.083 --> 20:28.883
and three months later,
he died.

20:28.885 --> 20:31.052
He'd also died
of a heart attack.

20:31.054 --> 20:33.421
You know, Walt, I just talked to
another guy a little while ago,

20:33.423 --> 20:34.823
and he told me
about five deaths

20:34.825 --> 20:36.391
associated with
the Balmer family

20:36.393 --> 20:37.826
that used to live
on the property,

20:37.828 --> 20:39.694
and with this four,
that makes nine.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.197
- That's a lot.
- I agree.

20:45.135 --> 20:48.703
A lot of whatever
it's doing now is revenge.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.673
What does this elemental
thing do to the living?

20:51.675 --> 20:54.709
It gets its energy from
the living,

20:54.711 --> 20:57.545
like, energy vampire
kind of thing, I think.

21:00.383 --> 21:02.250
So how would the living
be affected?

21:02.252 --> 21:05.720
It would drain them.
It makes people sick.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.790
Their life source, like,
is being sucked out of them,

21:08.792 --> 21:10.458
and they're turning
into mummies.

21:10.460 --> 21:13.595
It's almost like the person's,
like, dehydrating

21:13.597 --> 21:15.597
and, like, starving to death,

21:15.599 --> 21:18.600
so then it would affect living
people's organs after a while,

21:18.602 --> 21:21.736
so, like, kidney function,
neurological,

21:21.738 --> 21:23.404
like, issues, okay?

21:23.406 --> 21:26.407
I feel like I was having
a heart attack.

21:26.409 --> 21:29.344
After a while of consistently
being exposed to this thing,

21:29.346 --> 21:31.446
the body's not able
to stabilize itself.

21:31.448 --> 21:34.015
The body shuts down.
People die.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.024
For more information
about the show,

21:43.026 --> 21:44.659
and if you need us
to investigate

21:44.661 --> 21:46.394
unexplained activity
in your home...

Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story,

21:52.002 --> 21:53.168
and we'll help if we can.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.860
So far, I've got clients
being physically attacked

22:02.862 --> 22:06.197
on a property connected
to nine deaths,

22:06.199 --> 22:08.833
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

22:08.835 --> 22:11.869
Searching through old records,
I come across a gruesome murder

22:11.871 --> 22:15.173
where a husband bludgeoned
his wife to death.

22:15.175 --> 22:17.642
Turns out, the homicide
took place less than a mile

22:17.644 --> 22:19.477
from Rene and Edward's property.

22:19.479 --> 22:20.712
I'm meeting a local historian

22:20.714 --> 22:22.947
who says the story
of this murder is so crazy,

22:22.949 --> 22:24.616
it could be made into a movie.

22:29.990 --> 22:31.122
Well, Chris, thanks
for meeting with me.

22:31.124 --> 22:32.490
I appreciate it.

22:32.492 --> 22:34.559
This crazy murder you talked
about to me on the phone,

22:34.561 --> 22:36.928
before we get to it, what do
we know about the perpetrator?

22:36.930 --> 22:39.030
Well, his name is
Elmer Smith.

22:39.032 --> 22:41.766
He had a 208-acre farm
about 3/4 mile

22:41.768 --> 22:43.234
from where you guys are
investigating.

22:43.236 --> 22:45.236
He's got a psycho look
on his face.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.071
You think that's bad,
wait until you see his wife.

22:47.073 --> 22:48.139
Really?

22:48.141 --> 22:51.175
In 1937, Elmer marries
Helen Forrest.

22:51.177 --> 22:53.311
She moves on the farm
right away.

22:53.313 --> 22:55.013
As soon as she moved
on the property,

22:55.015 --> 22:57.482
the two began
to fight constantly.

22:57.484 --> 22:59.050
Now they're only married
not even a year,

22:59.052 --> 23:02.420
and she's already
filing for divorce.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.921
Now, Chris, take me
to the day of the murder.

23:03.923 --> 23:05.189
What happened?

23:05.191 --> 23:08.192
Well, on Thanksgiving night,
November 24, 1938,

23:08.194 --> 23:11.162
it all kind of came to a head
when a huge argument broke out

23:11.164 --> 23:12.997
between them
about how the farm

23:12.999 --> 23:14.966
was gonna be settled
in the divorce.

23:14.968 --> 23:16.968
The argument raised to the point
where she comes at him

23:16.970 --> 23:20.438
with a kitchen knife, screaming,
"I've got murder in my heart!"

23:20.440 --> 23:22.373
Okay.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.208
Well, he picks up a piece
of wood from the stove,

23:24.210 --> 23:26.010
hits her upside
of the head with it,

23:26.012 --> 23:28.112
and murders her.

23:28.114 --> 23:29.347
Does he confess?

23:29.349 --> 23:31.349
Well, not right away.
He panics.

23:31.351 --> 23:34.218
He takes the piece of wood,
her clothing, and burns it.

23:34.220 --> 23:37.121
Then he takes the body,
puts it in a large burlap bag,

23:37.123 --> 23:38.656
takes it to the back end
of the farm,

23:38.658 --> 23:40.958
and drops it
in an abandoned well.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.827
So obviously,
he gets arrested,

23:42.829 --> 23:44.128
so they must have
found the body.

23:44.130 --> 23:46.798
- What happened?
- Well, he cracks under pressure,

23:46.800 --> 23:49.000
and he admits to the whole
thing to the sheriff,

23:49.002 --> 23:51.436
and tells them
where the body is at.

23:51.438 --> 23:53.871
Okay, so now, Chris,
does he plead out

23:53.873 --> 23:55.540
or does he go to trial?

23:55.542 --> 23:57.975
There's a 2-week-long
jury trial.

23:57.977 --> 23:59.677
Okay, so what happened?
He gets convicted?

23:59.679 --> 24:01.546
The jury acquits him
of the murder.

24:01.548 --> 24:02.747
They acquit him?

24:02.749 --> 24:04.749
The minister
of the Methodist church

24:04.751 --> 24:06.484
that he attended
testified that

24:06.486 --> 24:08.753
he was a religious man
and well-respected,

24:08.755 --> 24:11.622
a mild-mannered individual
who attended church regularly

24:11.624 --> 24:13.124
until the time of the murder.

24:13.126 --> 24:16.160
- So now, he's acquitted.
- Yes.

24:16.162 --> 24:17.428
Does he stay on the property,
get married again?

24:17.430 --> 24:18.629
What happens to this guy?

24:18.631 --> 24:20.832
As far as I know,
he stays on the property,

24:20.834 --> 24:23.434
and he lives to the ripe
old age of 72 years old,

24:23.436 --> 24:25.737
passing away in 1955.

24:25.739 --> 24:27.505
There's his death certificate.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.540
He wind up getting away
with murder.

24:29.542 --> 24:30.808
You're right.

24:30.810 --> 24:33.578
This could be made into
a movie of the week.

24:33.580 --> 24:37.215
I'm trying to get more on
who this pastor guy was in life.

24:37.217 --> 24:40.852
He's got the Bible in his left
hand, and he wears this outfit,

24:40.854 --> 24:42.220
you know, like the pastors
used to wear

24:42.222 --> 24:44.322
with the big black hat
and the black suit.

24:44.324 --> 24:45.757
Do you get any time period?

24:45.759 --> 24:50.128
I'm gonna place him
in 1940 or on.

24:50.130 --> 24:52.330
Do you know if he has
some connection to the property?

24:52.332 --> 24:55.266
I feel like there was
a different structure,

24:55.268 --> 24:58.069
but he is associating
himself with this place.

24:58.071 --> 24:59.537
I don't know why, yet.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.039
I don't know, so I guess,
he's, like, a psychopath.

25:08.148 --> 25:09.781
And there's another
dead person here.

25:09.783 --> 25:11.416
It's a female.

25:11.418 --> 25:13.918
It's, I think, like,
maybe a wife?

25:13.920 --> 25:15.787
It feels like they might
have been married,

25:15.789 --> 25:18.790
but it wouldn't have been
a real marriage.

25:20.326 --> 25:22.160
I don't know how this person
who died in here died,

25:22.162 --> 25:23.928
but it was not good,
and I'm freaking out

25:23.930 --> 25:26.731
because it was, like,
a struggle.

25:29.102 --> 25:30.735
He's yelling at her.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.438
I could say he was abusive.

25:33.440 --> 25:37.208
I'm seeing him throw
this chick out, outside.

25:38.511 --> 25:41.813
Something about the floors...
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

25:41.815 --> 25:43.114
He's like, "I keep trying
to clean 'em,

25:43.116 --> 25:44.382
"and I can't get 'em clean.

25:44.384 --> 25:46.284
I can't get 'em clean.
I can't get 'em clean."

25:46.286 --> 25:47.819
I think he killed her.

25:47.821 --> 25:49.253
Boom. Done.

25:56.362 --> 25:59.864
I saw a lot of disturbing
things during my walk,

25:59.866 --> 26:01.899
but two stood out.

26:01.901 --> 26:04.802
First, the vengeful creature
I saw outside.

26:04.804 --> 26:08.372
He has created himself
in the image of the tree,

26:08.374 --> 26:11.242
so his skin takes
on the bark appearance.

26:11.244 --> 26:12.510
All right.

26:12.512 --> 26:14.912
His face is
more insect-looking.

26:14.914 --> 26:17.181
There's no nose or mouth
or anything,

26:17.183 --> 26:20.284
and it's kind of
a V-shaped.

26:20.286 --> 26:23.821
Next, I described
the angry pastor.

26:23.823 --> 26:25.656
He has the black jacket

26:25.658 --> 26:28.559
and a white,
buttoned-up shirt.

26:28.561 --> 26:32.330
It's got
that wide-brimmed hat.

26:32.332 --> 26:34.699
Looks like he's been,
like, beat up.

26:39.706 --> 26:41.672
Amy, is this who you saw?

26:41.674 --> 26:42.840
Yes.

27:02.454 --> 27:05.355
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:05.357 --> 27:07.457
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:07.459 --> 27:09.993
and our clients
for the first time.

27:09.995 --> 27:13.129
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Rene and her husband Edward.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.565
Now we're sitting here,
so obviously,

27:15.567 --> 27:17.233
the activity
in this place is bad.

27:17.235 --> 27:20.070
In fact, Rene told me
it's tearing their family apart.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.471
But the real reason
she called us in

27:21.473 --> 27:23.873
is because she thinks
that whatever is here is deadly,

27:23.875 --> 27:26.276
and she's convinced
it's going after Edward.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.345
So now I've introduced
Amy to you guys,

27:28.347 --> 27:30.180
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk with us.

27:33.285 --> 27:37.087
Interestingly enough,
on this particular walk,

27:37.089 --> 27:42.025
a living person actually
put a little bit of a block up

27:42.027 --> 27:46.596
so that I couldn't get a lot
of, like, personal things.

27:46.598 --> 27:50.934
I got that this person has
a lot of emotional issues

27:50.936 --> 27:54.804
that they don't want
to deal with or discuss.

27:54.806 --> 27:56.840
So you know I told you
how Rene thinks

27:56.842 --> 27:58.775
Edward's the target, right?
- Right.

27:58.777 --> 28:00.110
Well, she also thinks

28:00.112 --> 28:02.612
it's because Edward's got
some emotional problems.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.514
Okay.

28:04.516 --> 28:09.753
My father murdered
my two brothers in a fire.

28:09.755 --> 28:13.890
I spent 81/2 years
in an orphanage.

28:13.892 --> 28:17.127
It has been a struggle.

28:17.129 --> 28:21.064
It feels like the world
is on top of me.

28:21.066 --> 28:24.667
Amy, do you think Edward
is the person that blocked you?

28:24.669 --> 28:26.069
It's possible.

28:26.071 --> 28:29.372
It's something that you might
be doing inadvertently

28:29.374 --> 28:31.775
as a protection measure
for yourself.

28:34.613 --> 28:36.813
What else was going on?

28:36.815 --> 28:39.749
One of the things
that I saw during my walk

28:39.751 --> 28:42.585
was a deceased female,

28:42.587 --> 28:46.122
and I saw her in
the upstairs bedroom,

28:46.124 --> 28:47.757
the very back one.

28:47.759 --> 28:49.325
That's their bedroom.

28:49.327 --> 28:52.162
She was going through
extreme despair,

28:52.164 --> 28:56.633
and also, I think if anybody
was even slightly sensitive,

28:56.635 --> 28:59.569
they would occasionally
see her.

28:59.571 --> 29:03.840
So, Rene, you told me about
the woman you saw in your bed.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.542
Tell Amy about that.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.911
She turned and looked at me,

29:07.913 --> 29:11.047
and had these, like,
piranha teeth,

29:11.049 --> 29:14.417
and then
she just faded away.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.686
You get any idea who this woman
might have been?

29:16.688 --> 29:19.656
I believe that she was
the wife of a dead male

29:19.658 --> 29:22.358
that is in this house.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.295
I was able to get a lot more
on him than her.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.163
This is not a good guy.

29:27.165 --> 29:30.700
I got that he was from
probably around 1940,

29:30.702 --> 29:33.803
and he kept showing me
a different structure,

29:33.805 --> 29:34.971
but for some reason,

29:34.973 --> 29:38.074
he was associating himself
with this place.

29:38.076 --> 29:41.478
He was wearing a black suit,
round, black hat.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.581
His dress reminded me
of a pastor's dress,

29:44.583 --> 29:47.150
and he kind of claimed
to be a man of God.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.018
And then I got that
at some point,

29:49.020 --> 29:52.255
he changed direction
in his life.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.958
He's extremely angry,
very abusive,

29:54.960 --> 29:57.360
had some serious issues
with his wife.

29:57.362 --> 29:58.928
It didn't feel like
a real marriage.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.397
I saw them fighting
in the back room.

30:01.399 --> 30:03.466
I saw her falling
to the ground.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.703
I saw him throwing her out
of the door and yelling at her.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.038
The woman kept saying,
"I want to die. I want to die."

30:09.040 --> 30:13.443
And then I saw the man trying
to clean the floors inside,

30:13.445 --> 30:15.745
and then he was screaming
at me to get out.

30:15.747 --> 30:16.980
Like, he didn't want me
to see

30:16.982 --> 30:20.483
what the hell
was going on there.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.585
That's pretty interesting stuff
she's just talking about...
Wow.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.254
because she reminds me
of a homicide

30:24.256 --> 30:28.258
I came across in my research
that happened about 3/4-mile

30:28.260 --> 30:31.227
from where your house is.

30:31.229 --> 30:34.230
Perp was a guy named
Elmer Smith. He was 55.

30:34.232 --> 30:38.568
In 1937, Smith married
a woman named Helen Forrest.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.003
Now as soon as she moved there,

30:40.005 --> 30:42.238
they started fighting
like cats and dogs,

30:42.240 --> 30:43.439
and after less then a year,

30:43.441 --> 30:45.475
Helen told Elmer
she wanted a divorce.

30:45.477 --> 30:49.178
On Thanksgiving night,
November 24, 1938,

30:49.180 --> 30:51.648
Elmer and Helen
had a horrible fight.

30:51.650 --> 30:54.350
Things got violent,
and Helen grabbed a knife.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.519
Elmer grabs
a piece of firewood...

30:56.521 --> 31:00.256
...and bashes her brain in
and kills her.

31:00.258 --> 31:01.491
The guy you saw
was cleaning the floor

31:01.493 --> 31:04.227
and trying to hide something
from you, right?

31:04.229 --> 31:06.496
Yeah.
Elmer tried to cover up
the homicide.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.966
He took Helen's clothes
and the wood

31:09.968 --> 31:11.701
that he bashed her brains in
with, and he burned it.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.002
No.

31:13.004 --> 31:16.005
Then he put Helen's body
into a burlap bag

31:16.007 --> 31:19.475
and basically dumped it down
an old well on the property.

31:19.477 --> 31:23.413
In March of 1939,
he got acquitted by a jury.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.782
Turns out, he was very
well-liked in the community.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.517
In fact,
the local Methodist minister

31:27.519 --> 31:29.586
spoke on Elmer's behalf.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.154
Now, Amy,
you said the guy you saw

31:31.156 --> 31:33.056
was a man of God
until they went crazy.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.091
Well, the minister said in court

31:35.093 --> 31:39.495
that Elmer was in church every
week up until the homicide,

31:39.497 --> 31:41.164
then he stopped going.

31:41.166 --> 31:45.034
Now I was able to track down
a photo of Elmer.

31:45.036 --> 31:48.771
He's a real peachy-looking
type of guy.

31:48.773 --> 31:51.040
Is it possible Elmer's
the guy you saw?

31:51.042 --> 31:52.976
I had a sketch done.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.486
This guy's creepy looking.

32:03.488 --> 32:07.223
You guys take a look.

32:07.225 --> 32:10.693
- Wow.
- I can see it.

32:12.831 --> 32:14.764
Mouth's perfectly the same.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.067
The nose is perfectly the same.

32:18.069 --> 32:20.536
It's him.

32:20.538 --> 32:23.439
So does this pastor guy
do anything to these two?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.241
I think
there's a couple of ways

32:25.243 --> 32:29.212
that you would be able
to interact with him.

32:29.214 --> 32:32.615
You would see him,
more than likely

32:32.617 --> 32:36.819
as an apparition
or shadowy figure

32:36.821 --> 32:38.588
with his hat.

32:40.258 --> 32:45.662
Sometimes, we will see
a tall shadow figure

32:45.664 --> 32:48.498
with a hat.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.600
One of the things that he was
very proud of is that

32:50.602 --> 32:52.468
he can go inside
of your minds

32:52.470 --> 32:55.772
while you're asleep
and enter your dreams,

32:55.774 --> 32:58.074
and he can manipulate them,

32:58.076 --> 33:03.312
so I would assume that you would
have serious sleep issues.

33:03.314 --> 33:06.015
When I'm trying to
go to bed,

33:06.017 --> 33:08.785
the thoughts will start
flying through my head,

33:08.787 --> 33:12.422
just terrible things
of car crashes,

33:12.424 --> 33:14.357
and I've actually
heard in my head,

33:14.359 --> 33:16.793
"You know, you really should
kill yourself

33:16.795 --> 33:19.529
and do them a favor."

33:19.531 --> 33:21.664
The thing that
concerned me the most

33:21.666 --> 33:25.802
is that he could potentially
get physical with the living,

33:25.804 --> 33:29.005
and what I got was
specifically pushing,

33:29.007 --> 33:30.973
punching, and scratching.

33:30.975 --> 33:36.679
I woke up and have felt that
I've been punched in the face.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.948
You also get the feeling
of being choked, right?

33:38.950 --> 33:40.116
Yes.

33:40.118 --> 33:43.453
I mean, like, the finger
down the throat.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.587
Wow.

33:44.589 --> 33:45.955
Edward, do me a favor,
and tell Amy about

33:45.957 --> 33:47.557
when you got attacked
in the kitchen.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.227
I got kicked violently
in the chest.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.863
I flew back, hit my head.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.234
And it totally
knocked me stupid.

33:58.236 --> 34:01.204
This is all being caused
by this pastor guy?

34:01.206 --> 34:04.073
- Yeah.
- I'm frightened.

34:07.078 --> 34:09.645
The next thing I saw
is a huge problem

34:09.647 --> 34:12.047
and has me very concerned.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.751
So what I ran into outside

34:14.753 --> 34:17.018
is what's called
an earth elemental.

34:17.021 --> 34:20.723
So this is being that was
originally part of the Earth,

34:20.725 --> 34:23.025
but something
caused this thing

34:23.027 --> 34:27.196
to separate itself
from the Earth,

34:27.197 --> 34:30.900
and it became its own
conscious entity.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.369
I think that this thing,
more than likely,

34:33.371 --> 34:36.539
has affected every person
who's ever lived here,

34:36.541 --> 34:38.306
and what it likes to do

34:38.309 --> 34:42.145
is create hardships
in people's lives.

34:42.147 --> 34:45.848
And in some
very extreme cases,

34:45.850 --> 34:48.083
it could cause death.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.753
I did see a lot of
dead bodies during my walk,

34:50.755 --> 34:53.456
and I think they might
be from this thing.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.958
There have been a lot of deaths
on the property over the years,

34:55.960 --> 34:57.160
but individually,

34:57.162 --> 34:59.595
none of them are
that shocking to me.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.430
But the sheer number of
the people who have died here

35:01.432 --> 35:03.099
is what stands out to me.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.667
I'll take the Balmer family.

35:04.669 --> 35:07.503
They bought this property
back in 1851.

35:07.505 --> 35:10.573
Now, five of them died
right here on the property.

35:10.575 --> 35:12.675
I've got
their death certificates.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.811
It's just a whole bunch of 'em.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.445
So I had
a local genealogist look into

35:16.447 --> 35:18.147
the more recent deaths
on your property,

35:18.149 --> 35:20.683
and he came up
with four in 50 years.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.451
- So I got...
- Wow.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.953
...another bunch
of death certificates

35:23.955 --> 35:25.588
to go with the property.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.924
And the causes of death
cover the spectrum.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.425
I mean, we're talking
heart attacks,

35:29.427 --> 35:32.695
abdominal problems,
intestinal cancer, you name it.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.598
Now, is this elemental thing
possibly the reason

35:35.600 --> 35:38.234
for the deaths
you're talking about?

35:38.236 --> 35:40.703
It could've caused
some of 'em.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.905
Could people see this elemental?
What does it look like?

35:42.907 --> 35:45.341
I did have a sketch
of what I saw.

35:53.451 --> 35:54.684
The hell is this?

35:57.422 --> 35:58.788
Wow.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.958
This thing's alive?

36:01.960 --> 36:05.127
In a way.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.864
Does this thing live
in the tree in the backyard?

36:09.334 --> 36:11.601
So why don't we just go outside,
cut it down, and get rid of it?

36:11.603 --> 36:13.803
No.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.404
Why not?

36:15.406 --> 36:18.574
Well, it'll just go to another
tree, or it'll go in the Earth.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.142
When he's collected
enough energy,

36:20.144 --> 36:24.013
he can break off into
little miniatures of himself,

36:24.015 --> 36:26.282
and these are
the parts of him

36:26.284 --> 36:30.753
that are able to
create chaos in your lives,

36:30.755 --> 36:32.488
and so kind of
what I got was that,

36:32.490 --> 36:35.558
all of a sudden,
everything will break down.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.059
Your car will break
down one day.

36:37.061 --> 36:40.563
The next day, it'll be
your A/C, which is not good.

36:40.565 --> 36:44.000
I'm so tired of living like this
because now I'm right back to,

36:44.002 --> 36:46.369
"My gosh,
the car is broke now.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.638
"The freezer
is full of maggots.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.573
"The dishwasher broke,

36:50.575 --> 36:54.377
and the sink in the bathroom
broke today."

36:54.379 --> 36:57.713
The other way
that it can harm you is,

36:57.715 --> 37:01.984
when it cut itself off
from the Earth directly,

37:01.986 --> 37:04.754
it lost its source of food,

37:04.756 --> 37:08.491
and now what it has to do
is feed off of living organisms,

37:08.493 --> 37:14.463
specifically living people
and occasionally animals.

37:14.465 --> 37:17.767
So, Rene, can you tell Amy
about the animals,

37:17.769 --> 37:19.802
situations going on with them?

37:19.804 --> 37:22.171
They die mysteriously.

37:22.173 --> 37:27.476
We don't understand
what or how they die.

37:27.478 --> 37:30.246
So, Rene, can you do me a favor,
and tell Amy

37:30.248 --> 37:33.115
how you feel drained
all the time in the house?

37:33.117 --> 37:38.054
Yeah, absolutely.
No energy whatsoever.

37:38.056 --> 37:41.490
I'll get up after
sleeping 12 hours,

37:41.492 --> 37:47.530
and within three hours,
I'm back in bed.

37:47.532 --> 37:52.001
Long-term exposure to
this thing can lead to death.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.570
I saw very specifically
organ-function issues,

37:54.572 --> 37:56.739
liver, kidneys, your heart,

37:56.741 --> 37:58.507
so that's why
some of these deaths

37:58.509 --> 38:01.811
may have been caused by it,
you know,

38:01.813 --> 38:05.181
especially people who are
already compromised.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.983
Your health has declined
since you've moved to the house.

38:06.985 --> 38:11.387
Yes. I just feel like
it's attacking me personally,

38:11.389 --> 38:16.392
physically and mentally
and emotionally.

38:16.394 --> 38:17.827
All right.
So what does this thing want?

38:17.829 --> 38:22.031
It blames living people
for ruining its land.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.934
It actually became
fueled by revenge,

38:24.936 --> 38:28.237
and it's trying to stop
at nothing to get you to leave.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.807
If you stayed here long enough,
it would suck you dry.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.543
- It is, yeah.
- That's exactly what we say.

38:34.545 --> 38:35.878
And it's, "My gosh,

38:35.880 --> 38:38.080
is the light being sucked
out of us?"

38:38.082 --> 38:39.815
Are they in a lot of danger?

38:39.817 --> 38:41.417
Yeah. Yeah.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.155
It wants you to die.

39:03.191 --> 39:04.691
So, Rene, you called us in

39:04.693 --> 39:07.627
because you thought Edward was
in danger and needed saving.

39:07.629 --> 39:11.097
You were right about that,
but based on what Amy told us,

39:11.099 --> 39:13.966
you're in a lot of danger, too.

39:13.968 --> 39:17.670
So now the big question is, can
you stay here and fight back,

39:17.672 --> 39:20.506
or do you need to get out
while you still can?

39:20.508 --> 39:22.709
So for that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:26.047 --> 39:28.915
My overall suggestion

39:28.917 --> 39:32.785
would be to move.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.987
Wow.

39:34.989 --> 39:40.026
This would leave no energy
source for the elemental,

39:40.028 --> 39:44.764
and I think he would
then pass away.

39:44.766 --> 39:47.133
But if you wanted to stay...

39:49.304 --> 39:54.107
you would need to have
a male voodoo priest come

39:54.109 --> 40:00.480
and do a ritual
in order to expel him.

40:00.482 --> 40:03.950
Why do you need a male voodoo
priest to get rid of the pastor?

40:03.952 --> 40:07.386
Because it's something that
would absolutely terrify him.

40:07.388 --> 40:10.923
He thinks that he has
religion on his side.

40:10.925 --> 40:12.825
The second thing
would be to find

40:12.827 --> 40:16.162
a Native American
holy person

40:16.164 --> 40:19.699
to try to deal
with the elemental.

40:19.701 --> 40:23.970
I don't know if that person
would be 100% successful,

40:23.972 --> 40:25.805
so that's where
you're taking the chance.

40:25.807 --> 40:28.641
It's a 50/50 shot,
and if it doesn't work,

40:28.643 --> 40:33.379
that thing will eventually
kill you if you stay here.

40:33.381 --> 40:35.481
Wow.

40:35.483 --> 40:38.284
You really want to take
a 50% chance on your life?

40:38.286 --> 40:40.987
- No.
- No. It's not worth it.

40:40.989 --> 40:43.523
I want to live.
I wanna be happy.

40:44.859 --> 40:48.828
This thing has tried to kill me
a couple of times,

40:48.830 --> 40:49.996
and I got lucky.

40:49.998 --> 40:51.531
I want away from it.

40:51.533 --> 40:55.067
You kind of gotta make
a hard decision.

40:55.069 --> 40:57.336
I don't see a way out.

40:57.338 --> 41:01.674
We've been looking
at houses already.

41:01.676 --> 41:05.545
We'll be prepared,
at least emotionally.

41:05.547 --> 41:08.648
It's been a 4-year nightmare,

41:08.650 --> 41:13.386
and this is the first help
that I've received.

41:13.388 --> 41:17.123
It's a miracle that
we're sitting in front of you.

41:17.125 --> 41:20.359
It really is, and I can't
thank you enough.

41:20.361 --> 41:22.762
I'm all right with
the answer, though.

41:22.764 --> 41:24.931
Didn't end well,

41:24.933 --> 41:28.935
but we do
have a new beginning.

41:28.937 --> 41:31.103
Rene and Edward
could have a voodoo priest

41:31.105 --> 41:33.472
remove the pastor guy,

41:33.474 --> 41:36.342
but there's no guarantee
a Native American holy person

41:36.344 --> 41:39.078
could get rid
of the elemental,

41:39.080 --> 41:42.181
so I really hope they take
my advice and move.

41:42.183 --> 41:44.183
If they do that, they should
be able to lead

41:44.185 --> 41:46.352
a safe and peaceful life.
