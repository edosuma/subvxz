WEBVTT

00:06.632 --> 00:09.590
Oh my god, Dyson. I love your pelt.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.713
Maybe she'll turn him into a coat.

00:11.804 --> 00:14.181
Maybe he'll give her rabies. Huh?

00:14.265 --> 00:15.471
I need another drink.
No maybes about it.

00:15.558 --> 00:18.675
--Wou|dn't that be awesome?
--Ladies! I didn't see you come in.

00:18.769 --> 00:22.261
Hey, Trick, another a|e for my partner
and a Sex on the Beach for the blond.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.766
How original.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.894
Your boy seems jolly tonight.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.145
Skank magnet.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.318
He's earned it. Come on. I mean,
we've been beatin' our heads

00:29.405 --> 00:31.396
against this massive
organized crime case.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.991
Now Dyson's convinced
the mob mistress

00:33.075 --> 00:35.236
to testify against her boyfriend.

00:35.328 --> 00:37.068
The girlfriend must have a death wish.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.495
Try a massive crush on Dyson.

00:39.582 --> 00:43.666
I'm good, but I swear, he could charm
his way into the Queen Mum's panties.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.914
Yeah, once he's done
with the waitresses.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.676
Guys, relax. Me and Dyson--
it's cool. I can handle it.

01:04.982 --> 01:08.224
Bo, lam so proud of... Oh!

01:08.319 --> 01:12.312
I still can't handle it. Oh god.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.194
Flaming tequila, crumbly old book.
Not a good combo, drunky.

01:16.285 --> 01:21.496
lam not drunk. I am coping. And Trick
is going to kill you for swiping that.

01:21.582 --> 01:27.122
Oh, no. What is he going to do?
Revoke my Fae library privileges? Aww.

01:30.549 --> 01:36.590
Here's one--the Festering Hex. We cast
this on Dyson, we can make it fall off.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.468
To his wang. May it rest in peace.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.890
Yeah! We hit him with the
old Bob Barker special,

01:41.978 --> 01:46.017
and then we hit his waitress with...

01:46.107 --> 01:49.395
...a bad case of Toadstool-itis.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.816
That cannot be a real thing.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.359
It is. Might be tricky.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.902
How much eye of newt
would you say we're packing?

01:53.990 --> 01:57.574
No. Besides, it's not the waitress's fault.

01:57.660 --> 02:02.245
I mean, Hale is right. Dyson
can be mighty convincing.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.289
Yeah, but with the right spell,
he can be completely neutered.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.992
Yeah! Right there.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.544
Uh huh.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.544
Hmm, you know what we should do?

02:14.635 --> 02:17.217
--What?
--We should invoke Baba Yaga.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.011
Baba what-now?

02:19.098 --> 02:22.716
Baba Yaga. Every young
Russian devotchka

02:22.810 --> 02:25.677
is taught to fear the old witch
who lives deep in the lost woods,

02:25.771 --> 02:27.807
in a cottage made of bones.

02:27.898 --> 02:28.853
Sounds kinda drafty.

02:28.941 --> 02:32.525
The bones of young girls who
don't do what they're told.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.103
My, you are scared of this Baba Gaga!

02:36.198 --> 02:39.565
Baba Yaga. And yeah, she's horrible!

02:39.660 --> 02:40.615
Okay.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.945
Horrible, but you know, occasionally
she'll help chicks get revenge

02:44.040 --> 02:46.281
on a dude who's wronged them. Uh?

02:46.375 --> 02:47.410
Okay, I'm listening.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.619
Okay, you get a mirror.
You say her name three times,

02:51.714 --> 02:54.080
you tell her the name of
the dude you want cursed--

02:54.175 --> 02:55.085
Bye-bye, wolf junk?

02:55.176 --> 02:57.792
Perhaps, we're concentrating too
much on Dyson's genital region.

02:57.887 --> 03:00.173
No. No. We can't curse Dyson!

03:00.264 --> 03:04.883
I mean, he sacrificed his
love for me to save my life.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.389
I mean, deep down we
know he's all noble.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.439
Yeah, he was noble back then,
okay? And now he's all dink.

03:11.525 --> 03:15.143
We're the good guys. We take the
high road. That's what we do.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.693
So, no Baby Yoda.

03:16.781 --> 03:19.614
--Baba Yaga
--Whatever. No curses.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.911
Even if seeing Dyson with someone
else, or a bunch of someone elses,

03:24.997 --> 03:27.739
hurts like hell.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.165
And it does.

03:38.094 --> 03:39.675
Good night.

03:39.762 --> 03:43.471
Bye. Drink up.

03:52.525 --> 03:53.981
Hey!

03:55.236 --> 04:00.731
Mat Mitlaw Baba Yaga.

04:00.825 --> 04:04.113
Baba Yaga.

04:04.203 --> 04:09.914
Baba Kitchorta Brababa Gitzeeavoya.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.960
[Russian]

04:22.805 --> 04:26.343
Because he thinks he's it,
but he's a shit.

04:31.105 --> 04:36.190
Make him understand what it feels
like to be rejected, to be hated.

04:36.277 --> 04:41.397
This is my vengeance plea.
Hear me, Baba Yaga!

04:41.490 --> 04:43.526
Whatever you are doing in there,

04:43.617 --> 04:49.988
my impending hangover and |
request that you please shut it!

04:57.923 --> 04:59.459
Okay.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.300
Whatevs.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.672
That was stupid.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.428
As you wish.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.851
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.854
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.857
My love carries a death sentence.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.030
l was lost for years,

05:25.117 --> 05:27.779
searching, while hiding,

05:27.870 --> 05:32.034
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

05:32.124 --> 05:36.993
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.892
Kenzi!

05:53.979 --> 05:55.435
[snoring]

05:55.523 --> 05:59.391
--Kenzi!
--|'m up!

05:59.485 --> 06:00.941
I'm up.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.524
How long has that stain
been on the ceiling?

06:08.619 --> 06:12.862
Also, ow!

06:12.957 --> 06:16.700
What is with the bathroom?
The mirror is completely shattered.

06:16.794 --> 06:20.127
How do you know it was moi?

06:20.214 --> 06:22.921
Why do | taste like shampoo?

06:27.638 --> 06:29.378
What did we get up to last night?

06:29.473 --> 06:32.340
This is what happens when you
buy wine from the bargain bin.

06:32.434 --> 06:36.018
Crappy merlot might explain
the mutual amnesia,

06:36.105 --> 06:39.643
but what about this itchy scab?

06:39.733 --> 06:44.102
Were we loaded enough
to hit a tattoo joint?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.232
Tramp stamps are so 2005.

06:46.323 --> 06:50.987
No. It's not a tat. I wonder what it is.
It's burned right into my skin.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.114
What the Fae?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.621
Gloria, whenever you feel guilty,
just remember how it felt

06:59.712 --> 07:04.422
every time Alberto slept with
your sister. You remember that.

07:06.218 --> 07:10.803
No. Look, I promised. I'm not going
to let him hurt you ever again.

07:10.889 --> 07:15.132
Okay. Deposition's in two days.
I'll see you then. Take it easy.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.603
Gloria getting cold feet?

07:16.687 --> 07:18.894
Well, she's still gonna
testify that her boyfriend

07:18.981 --> 07:22.189
authorized the hit on Capalucci.
Mister Alberto Rose is going to

07:22.276 --> 07:24.562
have to find himself a
new plaything on the inside.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.190
I must admit, you could talk
a nun into a three-way.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.068
Ah, the Crusades. Good times.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.195
| just wish you wouldn't flaunt
your skills in front of Bo.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.241
Excuse me?

07:33.329 --> 07:35.194
Come on, she's my
friend too, you know,

07:35.289 --> 07:39.623
and I want all of us to hang
sometimes without the awkwardness.

07:39.710 --> 07:43.828
So, what, you want me to pretend
that I'm not seeing other women?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.537
Let her think she's still got a shot?

07:45.633 --> 07:48.295
It's called subtlety.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.716
I prefer honesty.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.590
Honestly, you're a pig.
You even smell like one.

07:52.681 --> 07:57.926
Ooh, some women are
immune to the wolf. Wow. Yeah.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.851
--That hurt?
--|t itches.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.771
[TRICK] Definitely not a tattoo.
Definitely mystical.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.564
Well, my face would love
to hear your theories,

08:04.652 --> 08:06.734
once you're done consulting my butt.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.028
No need to feel self-conscious.
Just think of me as a doctor.

08:10.115 --> 08:14.028
A centuries-old,
bartending butt doctor?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.325
Almost like a letter, right?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.744
Y'all have some secret Fae
alphabet we don't know about?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.412
You should see our Fae Sesame Street.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.788
Don't tease, that would be awesome.

08:22.878 --> 08:27.121
But you're right. It's an initial.
A signature of some kind.

08:27.216 --> 08:31.255
So, Bo, what have you been
up to lately, Fae-wise?

08:31.345 --> 08:34.087
Mostly just trying to stay
off Lachlan's radar. Ugh!

08:34.181 --> 08:38.015
Have you dined with any herbalists?
Met with any Mer-folk?

08:38.102 --> 08:40.013
Qu'est-ce que huh?

08:40.104 --> 08:45.474
Have you... communed with
any particularly unusual Fae?

08:45.567 --> 08:49.480
Ah, hold up. Are you saying
Bo might have a Fae S.T.D.?

08:49.571 --> 08:50.947
--A what?
--Only if she's been sleeping

08:51.031 --> 08:53.363
with Baba Yaga.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.611
Baba Yaga?

08:55.703 --> 08:58.740
Tell me you didn't invoke her.

08:58.831 --> 09:03.495
Baba Yaga? The Baba Yaga that
you were talking about last night?

09:03.585 --> 09:06.622
That was just talk, right?

09:06.714 --> 09:07.794
Baba Yaga is real?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.872
And she's marked Bo as her own.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.960
Oh, Kenzi, what did you do?

09:15.472 --> 09:18.305
Okay. So, a couple hookers spit at you.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.348
A couple! Try five, man.

09:20.436 --> 09:22.552
Okay, five. Alright.
Let me help you out there...

09:22.646 --> 09:25.228
Oh, damn, here comes six... Oh!

09:25.315 --> 09:27.351
Calm down. Careful, I might enjoy this.

09:27.443 --> 09:30.731
Ah, thank god. I've been waiting
an hour to talk to someone

09:30.821 --> 09:33.312
about that street racing
in my neighbourhood.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.648
Ma'am, I will get an officer to
deal with that, just please wait--

09:35.743 --> 09:40.328
All of you think you own the road
just 'cause you have a penis!

09:43.417 --> 09:44.372
She must have been drunk.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.200
No! There was no
alcohol on her breath.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.331
And she didn't freak out
until I got in the room.

09:48.422 --> 09:52.165
That's why the Unis arrested her.
She'll undergo a psych evaluation.

09:52.259 --> 09:56.093
Get this man, everywhere I go today,
women are freakin' out on me.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.386
Well, now you're among friends.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.805
And I need a pint.
Where the hell is Trick?

09:59.892 --> 10:01.632
Oh, there's your girl.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.183
Audrey, babe, can I get a pint--

10:06.523 --> 10:07.729
--Sorry?
--Sorry won't stop you from

10:07.816 --> 10:10.307
breaking my heart. I see the
way you look at other women!

10:10.402 --> 10:12.017
There must be some sort
of misunderstanding--

10:12.112 --> 10:13.352
This is for womankind!

10:13.447 --> 10:17.941
--And this is for me!
--Whoa! Hey, alright. Ha! Yeah.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.024
--[AUDREY] Get off me!
--[HALE] Waitress--

10:19.119 --> 10:20.154
--[AUDREY] Leave me alone!
--[HALE] Yeah.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.907
When I found out about the Fae, I
knew that had to mean that Sasquatch

10:22.998 --> 10:25.330
and the Loch Ness Monster and
Little Miss Piggy all existed,

10:25.417 --> 10:27.533
but Baba Yaga can't. Okay? She can't!

10:27.628 --> 10:30.119
Kenzi, fess up! Why did
you sic Baba Yaga on me?

10:30.214 --> 10:34.423
I didn't! I wouldn't!
|-| can't remember what I did!

10:34.510 --> 10:38.594
The mark on my back, the shattered
mirror? It all makes sense.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.513
It doesn't make any sense!

10:41.600 --> 10:47.186
Okay, okay. The last thing I remember,
we were... we were bitching about...

10:47.272 --> 10:49.433
...him.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.186
--What?
--|'m gonna kill you!

10:51.276 --> 10:53.312
[DYSON] Come on. Jeez!

10:53.403 --> 10:54.904
Shazzbot.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.239
Just chill!

10:56.323 --> 11:01.989
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey! Hey! Hey! There ya go.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.285
I want to kill him.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.532
I've been there, sister.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.205
--I want to kill him.
--Fine.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.907
--I want to kill him.
--Yeah, okay.

11:09.002 --> 11:14.542
I got this. Yeah, I got this.
Yeah, walk away.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.420
Bo, what the hell is going on?

11:17.511 --> 11:21.129
Dyson, that mark. We've been cursed.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.757
Cursed?

11:24.852 --> 11:27.844
By Kenzi.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.678
Ta da.

11:34.653 --> 11:35.438
That hurt?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.518
Nah, it tickles.

11:36.613 --> 11:40.026
Okay, I get it. You're pissed.

11:40.117 --> 11:44.156
No, I understand, you hate me right
now, but you put a curse on me?

11:44.246 --> 11:45.952
--What, are you fourteen?
--Again, it wasn't me!

11:46.039 --> 11:47.950
It was Baba Yaga via Kenzi!

11:48.041 --> 11:50.418
Who does whatever she
thinks you want her to do!

11:50.502 --> 11:51.662
--Hey, not fair, man.
--Hey, not fair, man.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.335
You know, why would I want to
even bother to put a curse on you?

11:54.423 --> 11:57.039
As far as I'm concerned,
you and l are done.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.250
Apparently not. I knew
you were sensitive.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.504
I didn't think you were obsessive.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.257
Wow, you really are hateable right now.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.429
This is just great, Kenzi.
Thank you so much.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.427
So, what's the deal with
this Baba Yaga chick, anyway?

12:06.518 --> 12:09.476
She's a hideous witch who
helps young Slavic women

12:09.563 --> 12:11.224
take revenge on the men
who've wronged her.

12:11.315 --> 12:14.807
And she feasts on girls
who don't behave,

12:14.902 --> 12:18.019
or so moms used to tell me.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.195
And she's supposed to be a myth.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.398
When are you gonna stop messing
with things you don't understand?

12:22.492 --> 12:25.529
You're so bloody human!

12:25.621 --> 12:27.987
Kenzi must have invoked
the curse on Dyson.

12:28.081 --> 12:33.826
A curse that makes all women
despise him, in Bo's name.

12:33.921 --> 12:37.664
Hence, the shared mark
on both your skin.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.873
I didn't ask for this.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.173
But on some level, you wanted it.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.468
Baba Yaga only grants pleas when
there's an intense emotional connection

12:43.555 --> 12:48.675
between the wounded
party and her... target.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.980
Trick. Trick, you gotta help us.

12:55.067 --> 12:58.480
Out of the question.
Baba Yaga dwells in her own realm.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.403
A place other Fae can't
interfere with, let alone enter.

13:01.490 --> 13:05.324
Even if I could, I can't. That witch is--

13:05.410 --> 13:07.275
One serious slice of harsh?

13:07.371 --> 13:09.157
You have no idea.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.158
So, what am I supposed to do?

13:11.249 --> 13:13.661
You're gonna fix it. Now!

13:13.752 --> 13:18.246
You back off, or I will drop kick you
into a women's studies conference.

13:25.013 --> 13:28.972
Okay. I did it. I'll fix it.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.345
[HALE] How you gonna do that?

13:34.940 --> 13:37.431
About Dyson back there,
he didn't really mean it.

13:37.526 --> 13:41.394
Of course he did. And drunk or not,
so did I when l cursed him.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.820
You know, when Dyson left you,
it wasn't just your heart he broke.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.488
Well, he still doesn't deserve this.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.317
Neither do |. Having to
visit Aunt Ludmila?

13:48.412 --> 13:49.652
What, like your aunt-aunt?

13:49.746 --> 13:51.031
Yep-yep.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.830
Wow, it's just you never really
talk about your family very much.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.454
Chiquita, you're about to see why.

13:56.545 --> 14:03.007
The good news is your ancestors
are looking out for you.

14:03.093 --> 14:07.712
| see love! Ooh, riches!

14:07.806 --> 14:09.797
This from a woman who lives in a trailer.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.348
Take number please.
You want to be rich man?

14:12.436 --> 14:17.351
You must inhabit body
of rich man. Hmm?

14:17.441 --> 14:19.773
You act cheap, you die cheap.

14:24.740 --> 14:31.202
Oh, if you insist. May your
stars align until next time!

14:34.124 --> 14:38.493
And you know better than to
interrupt me when I am with client.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.124
And you haven't called in two months!

14:41.214 --> 14:45.207
And get over here so I can
give you great big hug!

14:45.302 --> 14:46.667
You too, Kenzi-friend!

14:46.762 --> 14:49.549
--Come, come!
--G reat.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.676
Yeah, this is torture.

14:52.768 --> 14:57.762
Kenzi, our youngest
cousin. So beloved!

14:57.856 --> 15:00.973
So cute! To think you
were once more wee.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.059
But such an imagination.

15:03.153 --> 15:07.863
Always with the crying and the
hiding. And the bed-wetting.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.689
Yeah, well, my stepdad taught me that

15:09.785 --> 15:13.448
real life is scarier than any fairytale, so.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.948
He was a bit strict.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.282
A bit? He would lock me in the
closet if I laughed too loud.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.619
So, I know you don't visit
from kindness of your heart.

15:22.714 --> 15:26.423
What do you need? Fake passport?
Place to hide, what?

15:26.510 --> 15:29.468
We need to reverse a Baba Yaga curse.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.893
ls April Fool joke, no?

15:37.979 --> 15:40.766
Here's hoping Dyson sees it that way.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.563
Why the hell did they
move this deposition up?

15:42.651 --> 15:44.107
It wasn't supposed to be 'til tomorrow.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.559
She's probablyjust nervous.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.360
I can't handle any more
psycho chicks today.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.278
Dyson! You're here.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.573
Hey, Gloria.

15:51.660 --> 15:55.949
I gotta lay low, alright? Wait until
Kenzi and Bo remove this curse.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.497
Organized Crime put in over 800
man-hours on this case, got nothing.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.826
Then we cracked it.
So, you gotta be there.

16:02.921 --> 16:06.459
Have you not noticed how chicks
are responding to me today?

16:06.550 --> 16:10.338
She loves you. And she's our only
chance to nail the Rose family.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.965
You got my back, right?

16:13.056 --> 16:14.796
Try to stay downwind.

16:17.644 --> 16:23.230
Girls. There is no Baba Yaga.
Like there is no Santa Claus

16:23.316 --> 16:25.147
or an honest Ukrainian.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.942
My charming fam, also a wee bit racist.

16:28.029 --> 16:32.614
You know what else isn't
supposed to exist? Succubi.

16:35.287 --> 16:40.031
Okay, making out with my peeps
to prove a point? Totally gross.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.034
What demon are you?

16:44.129 --> 16:48.498
She's a lamb chop compared to the
hag in the mirror. Okay, show her.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.923
Blya.

16:54.014 --> 16:58.474
I know how to summon
the Baba... in theory.

16:58.560 --> 17:02.018
Well, it's time to put
that theory to the test.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.939
Ah, Miss Chanel. Just going to clarify a
couple of things before we begin taping.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.392
You're willing to go on record
as Alberto's girlfriend?

17:08.486 --> 17:09.612
I guess.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.778
--O kay.
--I mean,

17:11.865 --> 17:15.232
Detective Dyson told me I should.

17:15.327 --> 17:18.319
Good. Great. And you'll
testify that your ex-boyfriend

17:18.413 --> 17:20.620
ordered the hit on the
boss of the Rose family?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.949
He did a lot of terrible things.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.205
Guys do.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.126
Oh, shite.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.001
--Would you want some coffee?
--|sn't that just like a man?

17:30.091 --> 17:33.925
To tell you that he'll protect you and
then show up late for your deposition.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.968
And abandon you. Dyson!

17:36.056 --> 17:37.967
--[HALE] Whoa!
--You son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

17:38.058 --> 17:39.218
--Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
--Get back here!

17:39.309 --> 17:41.174
--Get out of here!
--Dyson! Get back here right now!

17:43.647 --> 17:47.310
I am ready to summon Baba Yaga.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.230
What's that?

17:48.318 --> 17:50.809
It protects the wearer from a witch.

17:50.904 --> 17:51.859
Where's ours?

17:51.947 --> 17:54.563
| only have the one, moving on.

17:54.658 --> 17:57.616
Oh, lordy. Oh sweet, sweet Susan.

17:57.702 --> 18:02.571
I'm so scared, I can't even swear
right now. I think I might vom.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.531
It is an old lady in a mirror.

18:04.626 --> 18:09.620
No. Baba Yaga is-is a monster that
haunted my childhood nightmares.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.750
--Did I mention the vom?
--You're scared,

18:11.841 --> 18:15.584
I'm scared, so we'll be scared
together. Okay? Like always.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.840
--O kay.
--O kay.

18:19.975 --> 18:24.139
Mee vizev-ay-em te-beh-ah
ve-eed-mah lez-oh-ov...

18:24.229 --> 18:30.065
Mee vizev-ay-em te-beh-ah
ve-eed-mah lez-oh-ov.

18:34.114 --> 18:39.074
Mee vizev-ay-em te-beh-ah
ve-eed-mah lez-oh-ov.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.906
[Russian]

18:41.997 --> 18:44.579
Then you best be wearing diaper.

18:49.087 --> 18:54.377
Mee vizev-ay-em te-beh-ah
ve-eed-mah lez-oh-ov...

18:54.467 --> 18:59.587
Mee vizev-ay-em te-beh-ah
ve-eed-mah lez-oh-ov.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.227
--Kenzi?
--Hush, demon. We need her in trance.

19:11.484 --> 19:18.196
Baba Yaga, Baba Yaga, Baba Yaga,
Baba Yaga, Baba Yaga, Baba Yaga...

19:18.283 --> 19:23.619
I seek vengeance in Bo's name
on the one called Dyson.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.993
And I made good on that plea.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.665
Baba Yaga? Yeah, hi.

19:29.753 --> 19:33.996
The curse on Dyson was invoked in my
name, but not with my permission

19:34.090 --> 19:36.126
and I want it gone.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.004
I can remove the affliction.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.005
Great.

19:40.096 --> 19:46.183
In exchange for the succubus
in whose name it was made.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.725
What?

19:52.567 --> 19:56.276
Ludmila! Ludmila!

19:56.363 --> 19:59.526
Bo! Bo! No! No! I'm the one
that invoked the curse

19:59.616 --> 20:02.358
--and I'm the one that should pay.
--[LUDM|LA] Kenzi, no!

20:02.452 --> 20:06.570
l was hoping you'd say that.
l have no need for a succubus.

20:06.664 --> 20:12.034
But a nubile young girl
that I can devour!

20:14.214 --> 20:17.706
Kenzi?! Kenzi?!

20:29.145 --> 20:32.729
Bo? Aunt Ludmila?

20:36.027 --> 20:38.689
Baba Yaga?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.691
Miss Yaga?

20:42.117 --> 20:44.358
Oh, god.

20:44.452 --> 20:49.287
Oh, bone collection on display.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.491
Oh, scary Russian farm tools.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.959
They're all skeleton chic.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.005
Bo!

21:03.096 --> 21:05.712
Bo, can you hear me?

21:05.807 --> 21:09.470
Don't be scared. You are not alone.

21:09.561 --> 21:10.676
Who are you?

21:10.770 --> 21:15.264
We came through mirror.
Like you, we are hers.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.939
Oh, no, no, no.

21:17.026 --> 21:22.441
Oh, no way-sies. We got to get
outta here. Before she gets back.

21:25.702 --> 21:29.286
No! Ah, there's got to be a way out!

21:32.375 --> 21:33.911
Better see to your chores.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.334
Chores? Yes, insane Martha Stewart,

21:36.421 --> 21:38.833
that is definitely what we
should be worrying about.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.175
--Baba Yaga could be--
--Don't say her name.

21:41.259 --> 21:44.547
You really don't want to draw
attention to yourself in this place.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.471
C'mon. Help us prepare to the feast.

21:54.314 --> 21:59.024
Bo, I don't know where I am.
So, how will you?

22:01.654 --> 22:06.774
Ludmila! Ludmila, wake up! We have
to get Kenzi back from Baba Yaga.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.699
Sweetie, it's not possible.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.447
You have to send me
through that mirror!

22:10.538 --> 22:12.779
--|t's broken.
--So, we get a new one.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.739
It's not so simple.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.825
Okay. Okay.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.002
--Oh, what have I done?
--Oh god.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.703
Baba Yaga doesn't live in our world

22:20.798 --> 22:23.710
and she has very specific rules
of who she invites into hers.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.258
Well, I generally don't give
a rat's ass about rules.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.338
Some Fae are so territorial, they don't
let other Fae cross their boundaries.

22:29.432 --> 22:34.927
Dyson, this thing took Kenzi!
Stupid, stubborn, human Kenzi.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.807
And if you don't help me get her back,

22:36.898 --> 22:39.310
I am going to make this curse
look like a teddy bear's picnic.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.652
Of course I'm gonna help. I'm still me.

22:41.736 --> 22:42.896
Yeah, sometimes I wonder.

22:42.987 --> 22:46.900
Baba Yaga isn't going to kill Kenzi.
Not right away, at least.

22:46.991 --> 22:50.609
She's gonna want to fatten her up first.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.988
Lucky for us, that could take a while.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.741
--Well, that's hardly comforting.
--We|l, it's what we've got.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.571
Trick, we've gotta move on this!

22:55.667 --> 23:00.001
I can't help you.
But there is another way.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.999
It's just really dangerous, Bo.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.455
|t's Kenzi.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.883
Then you'd better learn to love
the taste of crow. Come on.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.849
So, when do we all get to go home?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.829
Where is you know who, anyway?

23:36.916 --> 23:40.204
Mama said the witch
stalks the underworld,

23:40.295 --> 23:44.584
making sure the souls of
the dead are not reborn.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.544
Okay.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.673
Yeah, someone should really tell B.Y.

23:51.764 --> 23:56.724
that these things come in
frozen french fry form.

23:56.811 --> 24:00.053
What good Russian girl doesn't
know how to peel a potato?

24:00.148 --> 24:03.140
If I was good, I wouldn't be here.

24:03.234 --> 24:06.146
Hi, I'm Elena.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.569
Kenzi.

24:08.656 --> 24:12.114
Love your top, it's super groovy.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.613
So, who was yours?

24:14.704 --> 24:15.944
The boy you cursed?

24:16.039 --> 24:21.830
He wasn't so much a boy as a horny,
hairy headcase. And he wasn't mine.

24:21.919 --> 24:26.458
Sam wasn't mine either.
He ditched me for my best friend,

24:26.549 --> 24:30.041
which is why I put a curse on him.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.672
He almost died.

24:31.763 --> 24:32.673
I'm sorry.

24:32.764 --> 24:36.507
l was too, which is why I
begged her to lift the curse.

24:36.601 --> 24:40.514
Which she did in exchange
for my life-long servitude.

24:40.605 --> 24:43.768
But you look so young.
And your clothes,

24:43.858 --> 24:47.271
Fiddler on the Roof reject over there,
how long have you guys been here for?

24:47.362 --> 24:50.320
Long enough to have seen
some terrible things.

24:52.158 --> 24:56.527
You think it's gonna get easier.
But it never does.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.125
Hey, what's back there?

25:08.216 --> 25:09.922
lt's off-limits.

25:32.532 --> 25:36.024
Agh!

25:36.119 --> 25:41.159
--Holy potato! What the crap is that?
--|t's the Domovoi. A guard... thing.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.455
What exactly is he guarding?

25:49.215 --> 25:54.005
That's all there is to tell, Lachlan.
I mean Ash. The Ash.

25:54.095 --> 25:56.757
l was thinking about brightening up
this place, take away the gloom.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.384
What do you think?
Get rid of the throne, yes or no?

25:58.474 --> 25:59.805
--P|ease.
--I still don't quite understand

25:59.892 --> 26:02.929
the urgency. Baba Yaga
has your human. So, what?

26:03.020 --> 26:03.884
Her name is Kenzi.

26:03.980 --> 26:07.313
If someone snatched my pet,
I'd just go and get another one.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.516
Mind you, lam growing
fond of my human doctor.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.475
And her name is Lauren, you bastard.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.357
--Bo.
--No! Can you help me or not?

26:13.448 --> 26:15.279
|t's tricky, but yeah, there is a shortcut.

26:15.366 --> 26:18.403
I can sneak you into
Baba Yaga's cottage.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.782
But the real question
is why would I do that?

26:24.125 --> 26:26.491
[BO] Because I've
reconsidered your proposition

26:26.586 --> 26:29.498
to freelance for you and the Light.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.207
As long as I can get Kenzi home alive.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.218
I hoped you'd come around.

26:37.305 --> 26:41.344
And to think all it took was some
persuasion from the Russian hag.

26:41.434 --> 26:45.222
Remind me to send Babs a fruit basket.

26:45.313 --> 26:49.477
Wait there. You'll get what you need.
Oh, and if you make it through this,

26:49.567 --> 26:51.603
we could talk about the
terms of our arrangement.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.275
lf?

26:54.989 --> 26:58.777
It all depends on how long
you can hold your breath.

27:01.579 --> 27:04.821
Elena, why are we just sitting here?
We should be trying to escape.

27:04.916 --> 27:08.124
Shh! It is time for the feast.

27:08.211 --> 27:12.796
I'm hungry and everything, but a
feast? Here? God, this is insane.

27:12.882 --> 27:18.127
This meal is not for us.
We make do with slop.

27:18.221 --> 27:19.586
Delicious slop?

27:19.680 --> 27:23.047
Quiet! She's back.

27:45.957 --> 27:49.040
What's with the sack?

27:49.126 --> 27:51.913
Whoever picks the black marble leaves.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.381
You mean a chance to get outta here?

28:34.797 --> 28:38.415
What's going on?
What's going on? Elena?

28:40.136 --> 28:43.219
She's not leaving-leaving, is she?

28:43.306 --> 28:46.013
Just be thankful it's not you.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.730
Elena, don't do this! You can fight!

28:54.817 --> 28:59.481
It's okay. Really. I'm so tired.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.153
No.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.066
At least now I'll be free.

29:32.021 --> 29:36.606
You dare to look at me, girl.

29:36.692 --> 29:40.981
Let me show you how I treat my pets.

29:41.072 --> 29:49.537
Domovoi, come. Domovoi, here.
Get it, it's good. It's good. Come on.

29:49.622 --> 29:55.788
Like I would feed such an
ungrateful creature as you!

29:55.878 --> 30:01.794
That bite you gave me
last week still throbs.

30:05.721 --> 30:10.340
You will find time moves
very slowly here, girl.

30:10.434 --> 30:15.645
Now, clean up this Elena.

30:23.990 --> 30:27.482
If I'm gonna do the time,
then why not the crime?

30:35.001 --> 30:37.367
Oh! Something bit me!

30:37.461 --> 30:44.754
l have already forgotten your name.
But from this, I will call you Dessert.

30:47.847 --> 30:51.260
My, my. Look who slithered
back into my pipes.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.590
I thought this curse was over.

30:52.685 --> 30:55.973
Look, nymph, you just think
you hate me. I'm under a curse.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.304
Oh, what, the curse of
not calling me back?

30:58.399 --> 31:02.688
Tulliver's New Year's Eve party?
You, me, hot tub?

31:02.778 --> 31:06.817
Chloe, I apologize.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.863
--Are you his latest?
--Another former.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.862
Well, you dodged a bullet there, honey.

31:10.953 --> 31:14.036
Or something that requires ointment.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.203
What is this about a curse?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.873
My friend has been
taken by Baba Yaga,

31:17.960 --> 31:19.496
and I need your help
to enter her world.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.669
I don't assist on suicide missions.

31:21.756 --> 31:23.712
Even under official orders?

31:28.054 --> 31:30.010
l was just joking. I swear!

31:30.097 --> 31:33.180
Haven't you ever played a rousing
game of Frying Pan to the Head?

31:33.267 --> 31:35.883
Bony! I'll put you in a pie.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.843
Quiet, you beast!

31:37.938 --> 31:41.476
Talk about ironic. You're about to eat
one of the best animal trainers in town.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.603
Do you take me for a fool, Dessert?

31:43.694 --> 31:46.527
Why else would the succubus keep
a dirty human like me around?

31:46.614 --> 31:48.525
You should see what
I did with her Corgi.

31:48.616 --> 31:51.824
And house beastie
etiquette is my specialty.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.572
Give me one week with your Domovoi

31:53.662 --> 31:57.826
and I guarantee he will never
growl or bite ever again.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.033
Considering you already
have a door with teeth--

32:00.127 --> 32:02.618
You have two hours.

32:02.713 --> 32:07.127
Perf. But I'm gonna need a few things--

32:07.218 --> 32:12.508
a switch from a willow tree,
a bell from a highland cow,

32:12.598 --> 32:17.262
and bones from a goat
born on a Sunday.

32:17.353 --> 32:23.474
When I return with these items,
it will be done, or else.

32:23.567 --> 32:28.106
Pie a la me. You got it. No worries.

32:28.197 --> 32:32.110
I will turn your Cujo into a Benji.

32:37.206 --> 32:41.415
Oh my god. So, that happened.

32:41.502 --> 32:42.457
I've heard about you.

32:42.545 --> 32:45.537
Your powers won't help. You won't
survive that trip to Baba Yaga's realm.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.667
I think you underestimate
how determined Bo can be.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.965
I'm going after Baba Yaga,
or I'll die trying.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.919
I even have an official
decree from the Ash.

32:53.013 --> 32:56.881
Of course, if you're willing to
defy him, that is up to you.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.637
Oh, what the hey.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.343
It'll be a nice change from cleaning
out the drains around this place.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.473
So, how does this work?

33:02.565 --> 33:05.728
Mirrors and water sources are
portals to the witch's realm.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.649
I'm a gatekeeper to
the local water portals.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.398
Great, so where do we do this, huh?
A lap pool, obnoxious fountain?

33:10.489 --> 33:12.229
Easy there, Little Mermaid.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.566
The process of crossing over
can be pretty gruesome.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.947
We better find a more private portal.

33:23.711 --> 33:26.043
Are you crazy? The witch will
know things have been disturbed

33:26.130 --> 33:27.711
and then we will all be punished.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.914
You know what? Mind your own vodka.

33:30.009 --> 33:33.627
Okay, not one of you lifted a
finger when Baba was eating Elena.

33:33.721 --> 33:36.178
Neither did you.

33:36.265 --> 33:39.757
Well, I guess we've confirmed
it's every girl for herself.

33:46.650 --> 33:50.142
Oh, I'm really more of a cat person.

33:50.237 --> 33:54.025
Here, boy. I'm sorry, Elena.

34:05.336 --> 34:07.622
Who's a good Domovoi?

34:15.137 --> 34:17.173
Who's a good Kenzi?

34:22.102 --> 34:26.061
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
time to bust this bitch's balls.

34:26.148 --> 34:27.888
Take me home.

34:30.903 --> 34:36.148
Home! Home! Take me home! Home!

34:36.242 --> 34:38.824
Any of you know how to
make this thing work?

34:40.871 --> 34:42.452
Bo!

34:42.539 --> 34:43.995
[BO] You trying to
give me hypothermia?

34:44.083 --> 34:45.414
It will help slow your heart rate.

34:45.501 --> 34:48.709
You have to be unconscious
to enter Baba Yaga's realm.

34:48.796 --> 34:50.957
And here l was worried
I might catch the sniffles.

34:51.048 --> 34:54.540
It's impossible to keep oneself under
water, to will the water into your lungs.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.546
Which is why someone is going
to have to hold you under.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.798
I'm going to be using all my
strength to hold this portal open.

34:58.889 --> 35:02.677
No matter what's gone down
between us, I trust you.

35:02.768 --> 35:06.477
Absolutely. It's kind of my curse.

35:06.563 --> 35:09.270
I'll give you as much time
on the other side as I can.

35:09.358 --> 35:16.275
When I was six, I almost drowned in
Lake Miniwappo. This won't be fun.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.926
Come on, Bo. Let go.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.975
Lake Miniwappo.

35:53.444 --> 35:56.936
[KENZI] Bo! Bo! Oh my god,
you came! Hi!

35:57.031 --> 36:00.023
This place is like Hansel and
Gretel meets Hannibal Lector.

36:00.117 --> 36:02.324
--Seriously, I missed you so much.
--Buckle up, we're leaving.

36:02.411 --> 36:04.618
Wait! But there's a Fae beastman
and the front door has teeth--

36:04.705 --> 36:08.163
Who dares enter my world uninvited?

36:08.250 --> 36:10.957
Don't worry, I brought
a house-warming gift.

36:13.547 --> 36:16.789
You're in my world now, succubus.

36:16.884 --> 36:19.626
And you're here without my permission.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.382
So, your powers are null.

36:22.473 --> 36:27.058
[KENZI] Bo! No. Bo, wake up!

36:32.399 --> 36:34.890
Son of a Baba, that bitch is strong!

36:34.985 --> 36:36.145
What happened? Where's Kenzi?

36:36.236 --> 36:36.770
Put me back.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.651
No. You can't deprive your
body of oxygen like that.

36:38.739 --> 36:41.401
Even Fae need to breath. And there's
no guarantee that we can revive you.

36:41.492 --> 36:47.112
I've lost you. I've probably lost
Lauren. I will not lose Kenzi!

36:47.206 --> 36:49.413
Go. Go. Go!

36:55.881 --> 36:58.042
[KENZI] Bo, she's coming back, okay?

36:58.133 --> 37:05.255
If the succubus is that interested
in staying, I can accommodate that.

37:05.349 --> 37:08.807
Say, in a nice rose sauce?

37:08.894 --> 37:11.761
I'm more of a marinara girl.
Get out of here, Kenzi.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.688
And how do you think
she's going to do that?

37:14.775 --> 37:16.231
With this.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.149
The mirror! That is mine.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.102
Oh, it doesn't seem to be working!

37:20.197 --> 37:24.440
Stop! You'll break it. You'll destroy
the only way you have of getting home.

37:24.535 --> 37:28.153
Oh, and the direct route
to your food supply, huh?

37:28.247 --> 37:32.832
We make a covenant?
You and the succubus can go back.

37:32.918 --> 37:36.160
I get to keep the mirror.

37:36.255 --> 37:40.339
Just look in that mirror
and picture home.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.044
What about the others?

37:46.140 --> 37:49.724
These girls, they are from
different times, different places.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.516
They cannot all go back.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.639
Like hell they can't!

37:53.730 --> 37:57.848
Ahh! No! Oh, no!

37:57.943 --> 37:59.808
Take this and think of home.

37:59.903 --> 38:02.235
No. No. No!

38:02.322 --> 38:04.278
Take this, think of home.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.033
Take this, think of home.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.610
But it's the last piece.

38:09.705 --> 38:12.788
That's my best friend,
I won't leave without her. Go.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.536
Thank you.

38:19.256 --> 38:20.245
You!

38:20.340 --> 38:23.298
Bo? Bo, get up!

38:25.179 --> 38:27.511
If you hold her under much
longer, you're gonna hurt her.

38:27.598 --> 38:29.680
If I pull her out too soon,
she's gonna hurt me.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.722
Dyson, she's dying.

38:33.187 --> 38:34.768
You!

38:37.733 --> 38:44.320
I remember your name. I used
to watch you as a little girl.

38:44.406 --> 38:45.987
Kenzi.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.030
Come on, Bo.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.747
No pulse! Ah!

38:55.834 --> 38:58.826
You were petrified of me.

38:58.921 --> 39:04.416
But there was someone who scared
you even more. Your stepfather.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.920
I said be quiet!

39:06.011 --> 39:11.847
I used to watch you in the mirror.
You would call my name once... twice.

39:11.934 --> 39:15.017
And I'd be waiting in the shadows.

39:21.276 --> 39:27.021
Oh, and you never had the guts
to call me the third time!

39:27.115 --> 39:31.984
To actually summon me to destroy the
man who was making your life miserable.

39:32.079 --> 39:35.492
Well, I'm not that scared girl
anymore. Thanks to her.

39:35.582 --> 39:41.168
Considering how big you've grown, it's
almost a shame I'm going to eat you.

39:41.255 --> 39:44.747
You must pay for what you have done!

39:57.104 --> 39:59.641
I told you I was good with pets.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.616
[CHLOE] Dyson, stop.
She's not coming back.

40:13.704 --> 40:16.912
--Oh my god. I'm in the tub.
--[DYSON] Come on, Bo!

40:16.999 --> 40:20.082
--Oh my god, Bo!
--She wouldn't leave without you.

40:24.006 --> 40:25.621
Bo.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.689
iii/2%:

40:47.487 --> 40:51.275
From now on, I'm stickin' to showers.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.277
Good idea.

41:02.711 --> 41:05.123
Thank you. Your testimony
is going to make it possible

41:05.213 --> 41:08.546
for us to put away
Alberto Rose for a long time.

41:08.634 --> 41:12.502
And by the way, help me keep my job.

41:12.596 --> 41:16.509
And in return, you promise
that you'll keep me safe.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.683
I will personally drop you off
to your witness protection.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.978
Is this because I got a little
temperamental with you yesterday?

41:23.065 --> 41:25.898
Just saying good-bye. Doing my job.

41:25.984 --> 41:31.069
Dyson, do you always have
to be such a heartbreaker?

41:41.124 --> 41:46.710
Another shot? Chased by a
delicious pickle, of course.

41:46.797 --> 41:49.413
I can't believe you're
up for more drinking.

41:49.508 --> 41:52.295
I always drink after a barbeque.

41:52.386 --> 41:54.627
Well, I'm glad to see you so happy.

41:54.721 --> 41:57.554
But the next time you're not,
no more invocations!

41:57.641 --> 42:02.476
I hereby pinky swear. Mostly
because they're expensive.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.975
Aunt Ludmila's invoice. Yeah,
so much for the family discount.

42:06.066 --> 42:12.983
Three hundred bucks?
Speaking of family, your stepfather?

42:13.073 --> 42:19.569
He didn't hurt me-hurt me or anything.
And whatever, it was a long time ago.

42:19.663 --> 42:22.746
So, you faced your greatest fear
and lived to tell the tale.

42:22.833 --> 42:26.200
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.

42:26.294 --> 42:29.127
Only really got scared when I
thought I wouldn't see you again.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.546
Oh, Kenzi, I would
never give up on you.

42:31.633 --> 42:33.214
I know.

42:34.761 --> 42:39.130
Now promise me you
won't give up on yourself.

42:39.224 --> 42:44.469
In Russian, we have this saying,
"Do dna!" To the bottom.

42:44.563 --> 42:52.106
Of the glass, yes.
But also, you can fight, Bo.

42:52.195 --> 42:57.610
Fight for Dyson. Fight for Lauren.

42:57.701 --> 43:01.193
Fight for what makes you happy.

43:03.290 --> 43:04.746
To the bottom.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.869
To my bestie.

43:06.960 --> 43:15.049
May the only thing she ever sees in the
mirror be her own beautiful reflection.

43:17.929 --> 43:21.387
Da! 'Cause that girl is smokin'.

43:21.475 --> 43:23.591
--Oh, yes she is!
--So smokin'.

43:23.685 --> 43:26.267
No, seriously. Like, on a
scale of, like, one to ten...

43:26.354 --> 43:27.309
[BO] What? You're a ten?

43:27.397 --> 43:30.560
[inaudible]
