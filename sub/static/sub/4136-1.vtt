00:41.841 --> 00:43.009
Woman: Mr. Bishop?

00:47.246 --> 00:50.182
Mr. Bishop, we really
need you to stay still.

00:51.450 --> 00:53.419
Okay.

01:08.734 --> 01:12.271
Okay.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.777
Girl: This is gonna be good.

01:18.778 --> 01:21.447
Phoebe, Daddy’s trying to rest.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.419
That’s it. I’ve had
all I can stands,

01:27.420 --> 01:29.855
and I can’t stands no more!

01:30.890 --> 01:32.590
Daddy, put me down!

01:32.591 --> 01:36.227
You want to wrassle with "King
Crazy Hair," this is what you get!

01:36.228 --> 01:37.696
Hah!

01:37.697 --> 01:38.797
What’s "wrassling"?

01:38.798 --> 01:40.532
What’s wrassling?

01:40.533 --> 01:42.701
This is wrassling!

01:42.702 --> 01:46.806
Daddy! I’m dizzy!

01:48.374 --> 01:50.843
Me, too.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.112
Hey, I have a speech tonight.

01:54.113 --> 01:56.614
You want to come
pick out my tie?

01:56.615 --> 01:57.917
Yeah.

02:01.153 --> 02:05.090
Probably a good idea to wait for
the room to stop spinning, right?

02:05.091 --> 02:07.660
Uh-huh.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.635
Phoebe picked this out for me,

02:16.636 --> 02:19.270
and I managed to tie it myself.

02:19.271 --> 02:21.539
Trash is full.

02:21.540 --> 02:22.941
What?

02:22.942 --> 02:24.676
Can you take out the trash?

02:24.677 --> 02:27.078
But I just finished getting...

02:27.079 --> 02:29.914
Dressed, and you
look great as usual,

02:29.915 --> 02:31.282
and I am late.

02:31.283 --> 02:32.717
As usual.

02:32.718 --> 02:35.220
Yeah. Great. We’re
on the same page.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.622
Uh, only 10 more years till
Phoebe goes to college.

02:37.623 --> 02:39.158
We can do this, right? Bye.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.472
Bishop: It’s not
the artist’s job

02:54.473 --> 02:56.675
to reflect nature.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.743
The camera on my
iPhone can do that.

02:58.744 --> 03:02.914
The artist’s job
is to take nature

03:02.915 --> 03:05.383
and wrap it in a
beautiful little bow

03:05.384 --> 03:07.152
and present it in a way

03:07.153 --> 03:09.588
that even my agent
can understand.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.224
That might have
hurt his feelings

03:13.225 --> 03:15.794
if he were listening to
anything I’m saying right now.

03:15.795 --> 03:19.364
You are all blank canvases

03:19.365 --> 03:22.333
sitting in front
of blank canvases,

03:22.334 --> 03:24.969
and what could be more
exciting than that?

03:24.970 --> 03:29.041
Creation itself
is in your hands.

03:29.975 --> 03:32.445
Every stroke counts.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.548
Thank you all very much,

03:36.549 --> 03:38.417
and keep painting.

03:53.966 --> 03:55.901
Coming through.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.807
Ah, fiddlesticks.

04:02.808 --> 04:05.411
- What is it?
- Can you get the...?

04:07.913 --> 04:10.081
Man: Oh, jeez.

04:10.082 --> 04:13.384
Hello?

04:13.385 --> 04:15.087
Gracie!

04:16.555 --> 04:18.224
Uh, uh-huh...?

04:19.325 --> 04:23.529
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I’m sorry.

04:25.464 --> 04:29.869
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I’ve got
Michael manning your pot.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.338
- Ow. Ooh.
- Here.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.340
But listen. Hey, do
you think you could

04:35.341 --> 04:37.409
find it in your
heart to come in?

04:41.280 --> 04:43.681
Dinner was supposed to be 13...

04:43.682 --> 04:45.383
Okay, now 14 minutes ago,

04:45.384 --> 04:47.552
and we are still
on hors d’oeuvres.

04:47.553 --> 04:51.089
You are ruining my
son’s graduation.

04:51.090 --> 04:54.160
You’re ruining it!

04:58.664 --> 05:01.032
Gotta go.

05:01.033 --> 05:04.669
Well, at least the client’s happy.
That’s what’s important.

05:04.670 --> 05:08.072
Listen, are you gonna be
okay here for a second?

05:08.073 --> 05:09.507
I’m gonna go talk to her.

05:09.508 --> 05:11.177
- I’m good.
- Okay.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.082
Oh.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.286
You know, she was
at the lecture.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.854
Was she?

05:22.855 --> 05:25.623
Are you all right, Tom?

05:25.624 --> 05:27.425
I’m fine.

05:27.426 --> 05:29.627
Because as much as I
appreciate these checks

05:29.628 --> 05:32.230
from the college gigs,
I’m still waiting for...

05:32.231 --> 05:34.265
You’ll get it when it’s finished

05:34.266 --> 05:35.934
and not a second sooner.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.970
Could you give me a hint?
Is it 80% there?

05:38.971 --> 05:42.107
Well, you’re getting warm.

05:43.642 --> 05:45.443
Uh...

05:45.444 --> 05:47.646
are you gonna stay for dessert?

05:50.416 --> 05:53.518
I’m a happily married man.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.653
Heh.

05:57.389 --> 06:00.359
There’s no such thing as
a happily married man.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.673
Phoebe: Uncle Mac, you’re here!

06:15.674 --> 06:17.542
He’s always here.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.913
Go have a seat, ’cause I’m
about to rock your world.

06:24.416 --> 06:26.384
How’d he convince you to
let him touch the stove?

06:26.385 --> 06:29.887
He wanted to pull his weight.

06:29.888 --> 06:31.256
Maybe he can keep pulling it

06:31.257 --> 06:32.657
all the way to a new apartment.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.360
Val, you know I would
move out if I could,

06:35.361 --> 06:37.061
but there’s nothing.

06:37.062 --> 06:40.632
There’s literally nothing
that’s available.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.267
Oh... ah.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.335
There’s a lot of lies
on the Internet, Val.

06:44.336 --> 06:47.171
- I’m gonna get her juice.
- Val: Mm-hmm.

06:47.172 --> 06:51.643
Need you to show me how to do
that map thing on my phone.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.345
Why?

06:54.346 --> 06:56.948
I’m going to Century City

06:56.949 --> 06:59.652
to look at that restaurant...?

07:01.487 --> 07:02.987
The one that Michael
wanted me to see.

07:02.988 --> 07:06.057
Thought we talked
about this already.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.059
I’m just gonna look.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.562
She hardly sees you as it is.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.000
Fine. You have the GPS
thingy in your car?

07:16.001 --> 07:17.835
No, ’cause I have my phone.

07:17.836 --> 07:20.238
The last time you used the map
on your phone, you got a call,

07:20.239 --> 07:22.874
and you ended up in Temecula.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.344
That’s good. I’m taking
that for my act.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.981
Okay. Put the GPS in my car.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.084
Do you know how to use it?

07:33.085 --> 07:35.086
I will figure it out.

07:35.087 --> 07:36.954
I will program it for you.
As a matter of fact,

07:36.955 --> 07:39.058
I will draw you a map
just as a backup.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.899
Mwah!

07:47.900 --> 07:50.501
It’s called "helping,"
Val, not "controlling."

07:50.502 --> 07:52.837
- Mm-hmm.
- What happened to your hand?

07:52.838 --> 07:54.038
Nothing. It’s fine, Tom.

07:54.039 --> 07:56.475
- Bye, Mommy!
- Bye, baby!

08:04.950 --> 08:07.018
It is the perfect spot, Val.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.586
The kitchen hardly
needs any work.

08:08.587 --> 08:11.089
I mean, it is...
It is ready to go.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.825
Just a leak.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.396
Easy fix. Duct tape.

08:18.997 --> 08:21.399
Oh, Michael...

08:21.400 --> 08:23.735
Okay, uh, and yesterday.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.737
Remember yesterday when we were walking
through the seventh level of hell?

08:25.738 --> 08:26.938
You remember that?

08:26.939 --> 08:28.639
We’re better than that.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.742
You’re better than
just being a caterer.

08:30.743 --> 08:35.145
Every great chef, right,
needs her own restaurant.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.448
Look! A chandelier!

08:37.448 --> 08:41.385
Tom and I had an agreement.

08:41.386 --> 08:42.720
It was my decision, too.

08:42.721 --> 08:45.323
I know how much being
a mom means to you,

08:45.324 --> 08:49.094
but I also see your eyes
when you’re working.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.965
You love it.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.366
You do.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.737
Val, look, I believe in you.

09:00.239 --> 09:03.107
I want to be your partner.

09:03.108 --> 09:04.575
Let’s show the world.

09:04.576 --> 09:08.514
Let’s... let’s show your
daughter what we can do!

09:12.951 --> 09:14.318
Yeah?

09:14.319 --> 09:15.721
All right!

09:17.990 --> 09:20.125
Here it comes.

09:22.961 --> 09:24.796
To the queen of the kitchen.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.165
Thank you. Cheers.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.701
Cheers, my friend.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.472
So how’s Tom feeling
about all this?

09:34.606 --> 09:38.110
I haven’t told him yet.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.446
Because he wouldn’t understand.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.315
All right. Well, you
know, that sounds...

09:44.316 --> 09:46.985
really bad. This really sucks.

09:49.855 --> 09:50.856
Val.

09:52.791 --> 09:57.762
When did you know things were
starting to be a little bit...

09:57.763 --> 09:59.630
between you and Jake?

09:59.631 --> 10:01.065
Oh.

10:01.066 --> 10:02.800
Well, when his first mistress

10:02.801 --> 10:05.536
got into a fight with
his second mistress

10:05.537 --> 10:07.539
at my daughter’s christening.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.676
Oh, yeah, good times. Mm.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.244
Hm.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.712
What is going on with you?

10:14.713 --> 10:17.982
- Nothing, nothing.
- What?

10:17.983 --> 10:19.650
No, it’s just, um,

10:19.651 --> 10:22.454
things have been a little
bit cold lately, and...

10:24.156 --> 10:26.290
Do you think it’s
possible to still

10:26.291 --> 10:29.660
be in love with
someone, but fall...

10:29.661 --> 10:30.862
Fall out of like?

10:30.863 --> 10:35.867
Yes. It’s like, do
I love my husband?

10:35.868 --> 10:38.002
He’s my husband,

10:38.003 --> 10:39.403
but sometimes he’s...

10:39.404 --> 10:42.607
Oh, yeah. I know. But men suck.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.509
- Hi, girls!
- Hey.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.246
- Hi!
- Hey, munchkin.

10:48.247 --> 10:52.150
Hanson Carter’s new music video
comes on in five minutes.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.718
- Yeah.
- Hanson Carter!

10:53.719 --> 10:55.520
It’s gonna be totally awesome.

10:55.521 --> 10:57.155
You want to go
upstairs and watch it?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.156
- Yes.
- Yes!

10:58.157 --> 11:00.525
Okay. Okay.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.528
The babysitter’s
gonna be here soon.

11:17.142 --> 11:20.411
Wow. Just wow.

11:20.412 --> 11:23.614
That was... I’ve been watching
you for 15 minutes, Tom.

11:23.615 --> 11:25.516
You should sell tickets.
This is...

11:25.517 --> 11:27.985
It’s like watching someone
tend a Buddhist garden.

11:27.986 --> 11:29.987
You are a genius.

11:29.988 --> 11:31.756
Is it 5:00 already?

11:31.757 --> 11:33.592
People say I don’t
do anything all day.

11:36.428 --> 11:39.463
- Ladies?
- Brynn: Oh, my stars!

11:39.464 --> 11:41.365
Is that the Tom Bishop?

11:41.366 --> 11:43.701
I thought you did paid
appearances now, big shot.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.703
Yeah, yeah.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.373
Hi, Brynn. I got these for you.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.610
Which is a joke I thought
would be funnier.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.579
Tom: You guys ready to go?

11:54.580 --> 11:56.514
He’s way funnier onstage.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.349
Well, that remains to be seen.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.084
I mean, I have 40 laughs.
Brynn, 40...

12:00.085 --> 12:01.485
I’m managing expectations.

12:01.486 --> 12:04.555
Very smooth.

12:04.556 --> 12:05.995
-40 laughs.
- Brynn: Please tell me

12:06.007 --> 12:07.458
they serve alcohol
at this place.

12:07.459 --> 12:09.160
Val: Well, they better.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.128
Ooh.

12:11.129 --> 12:14.433
You’re going in on the
restaurant, aren’t you?

12:17.603 --> 12:21.305
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

12:21.306 --> 12:24.475
I think it would be
a great opportunity

12:24.476 --> 12:29.381
for us... for all of us.

12:31.216 --> 12:34.353
Well, I couldn’t have talked
you out of it anyway.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.293
But in this case,

12:42.294 --> 12:46.298
I think you’re out
of your league.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.708
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

12:57.709 --> 13:00.478
is why you never
date a pediatrician.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.480
My time is up. Thanks, everyone.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.248
Everybody give it up
for Chet Chaney, man.

13:04.249 --> 13:07.318
Come on, one more round of
applause for Chet Chaney.

13:07.319 --> 13:11.088
I hate this guy. Hate him.

13:11.089 --> 13:12.823
Is this the guy that Tammy...

13:12.824 --> 13:15.626
I thought you were over her.

13:15.627 --> 13:18.029
Oh, I don’t care about Tammy.
It’s Dale.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.797
He was my little guy,

13:19.798 --> 13:22.566
and we were gonna
raise him together,

13:22.567 --> 13:25.436
and now because she
doesn’t want me anymore,

13:25.437 --> 13:28.072
I gotta deal with the
fact that this guy

13:28.073 --> 13:30.174
is gonna be the one
tucking him in at night,

13:30.175 --> 13:34.845
that he’s gonna be the one
that looks at him as a father?

13:34.846 --> 13:37.782
It’s too much, man.
It’s too much.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.584
Come on. So you ready
for this next comic?

13:40.585 --> 13:42.053
Dale was your dog, right?

13:42.054 --> 13:44.456
Labradoodle.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.992
I think I just got the light.
I’m, uh...

13:47.993 --> 13:50.127
- Let’s go do this.
- Okay.

13:50.128 --> 13:52.930
- Break a leg.
- Brynn: How is Mac funny?

13:52.931 --> 13:55.700
I mean, I’ve not seen
him funny one time.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.902
- I don’t get it.
- Hmm.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.438
Uh-oh.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.006
What?

14:02.007 --> 14:04.375
Nothing. Nothing.

14:04.376 --> 14:07.545
Do you think I’m
out of my league?

14:07.546 --> 14:09.347
With the restaurant, I mean?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.249
Oh, honey. You’re in the majors,

14:12.250 --> 14:16.153
and the rest of us are just
playing intramural field hockey.

14:16.154 --> 14:19.757
When you say things like
that, I could just kiss you.

14:19.758 --> 14:21.025
Oh, well, at least wait
till I get to the bar

14:21.026 --> 14:22.660
so I can get some free
drinks out of it.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.963
Oh.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.837
Emcee: But, um, this guy

14:32.838 --> 14:34.605
is nowhere near as funny
as the last dude,

14:34.606 --> 14:37.408
but, hey, he’s here,
so everybody give a...

14:37.409 --> 14:41.480
A small clap for... Mac Brown.

14:44.816 --> 14:46.083
Uh, it’s a pleasure to be here.

14:46.084 --> 14:47.885
You almost missed Mac.

14:47.886 --> 14:50.121
The first thing I noticed as I look
around the room is we have ladies here.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.756
I just like to take a moment up
front and apologize to the ladies.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.657
Ladies, I’m sorry I’m
not better-looking.

14:53.658 --> 14:56.160
I wish I was a really good-looking guy.
I would take my shirt off,

14:56.161 --> 14:58.028
- dance around.
- You’d all be very excited.

14:58.029 --> 14:59.930
I had a conversation
with this girl once.

14:59.931 --> 15:01.499
’Cause I found out when
she was in college,

15:01.500 --> 15:03.300
she spent a semester in Ireland.

15:03.301 --> 15:05.736
I said to this girl, "When
you were in Ireland,

15:05.737 --> 15:08.305
were you with a lot of guys?"

15:08.306 --> 15:11.408
And her answer was,
"Don’t worry about it."

15:11.409 --> 15:13.077
And that is not a
very good answer.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.678
That is not what
you want to hear.

15:14.679 --> 15:16.013
Because women have a
particular kind of math

15:16.014 --> 15:17.515
when it comes to
hooking up, right?

15:17.516 --> 15:20.851
If she says "two," it
probably means five.

15:20.852 --> 15:23.487
If she says "five,"
it probably means 10.

15:23.488 --> 15:25.389
And if she says "Don’t
worry about it,"

15:25.390 --> 15:28.526
it means they’re singing
folk songs about her.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.561
In Ireland, as we speak...

15:30.562 --> 15:32.029
There is a statue
of her in Dublin

15:32.030 --> 15:35.734
the boys touch for good
luck when they turn 13.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.672
Anyway...

15:42.307 --> 15:45.576
I try to date, you know.
I date a lot.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.180
Okay, not a lot, but I try to...

16:30.455 --> 16:32.056
Doctor: Four to six months,

16:32.057 --> 16:34.692
you can expect the
first signs to show,

16:34.693 --> 16:37.428
usually, uh, tremors
in the hands and feet,

16:37.429 --> 16:42.900
then a relatively quick
decline in motor skills,

16:42.901 --> 16:47.438
followed by agnosia,
or the loss of ability

16:47.439 --> 16:51.709
to recognize people,
places, words, et cetera.

16:51.710 --> 16:55.479
Now, the usual course of
action would be to operate,

16:55.480 --> 16:58.082
but, um...

16:58.083 --> 17:02.253
the particular placement
being what it is,

17:02.254 --> 17:06.191
I’m afraid surgery is not
an option, Mr. Bishop.

17:10.127 --> 17:11.194
How much time?

17:11.195 --> 17:13.797
It’s hard to predict
with tumors.

17:13.798 --> 17:15.398
How much time?

17:15.400 --> 17:19.403
Nine months, a year at most.

17:19.404 --> 17:20.804
Ahem.

17:20.805 --> 17:22.306
Well, then I’ll have
my nurse schedule

17:22.307 --> 17:24.776
your first round of
chemotherapy for tomorrow.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.646
Tomorrow... tomorrow?

17:28.647 --> 17:31.682
We need to begin as
soon as possible.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.653
In the meantime, I’d like
to talk about your diet.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.622
Uh, not insofar as how it’ll
affect your prognosis,

17:38.623 --> 17:43.895
but rather how it’ll help you
tolerate the chemotherapy.

18:44.522 --> 18:46.992
Since when do you knock?

18:51.096 --> 18:52.096
Tom...

18:53.031 --> 18:54.899
What are you doing, Mac?

18:56.368 --> 18:59.237
All right, I knew
this wasn’t for me.

19:02.507 --> 19:04.241
"Passages of the Heart."

19:04.242 --> 19:06.410
Guy at the bookstore
said it is the best

19:06.411 --> 19:09.748
"your-friend-is-dying"
book for under $10.

19:12.017 --> 19:15.086
I-I’m sorry. I was... I
was just trying to help.

19:17.555 --> 19:19.623
I know.

19:19.624 --> 19:21.892
Seriously, though, how are you?

19:21.893 --> 19:23.294
I’m fine.

19:24.429 --> 19:25.462
How’s Val?

19:25.463 --> 19:27.665
She doesn’t know, not yet.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.401
Okay, not yet,

19:30.402 --> 19:33.537
as in you’re waiting to
see if there’s a cure?

19:33.538 --> 19:35.707
There’s no cure.

19:36.841 --> 19:39.677
All right, listen,
Tom, I am the last guy

19:39.678 --> 19:41.412
who should be giving out advice.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.081
I mean, I spend $200 a
month on comic books.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.849
But you gotta tell her.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.720
No, not yet.

19:50.388 --> 19:51.722
The second Val finds
out about this,

19:51.723 --> 19:53.490
this whole thing
becomes emotional,

19:53.491 --> 19:56.627
and I don’t have time for emotion.
Not now.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.630
I have a plan.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.266
And I need to stay focused
on that right now.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.968
So I was thinking about
our conversation

20:04.969 --> 20:07.806
the other night... about Dale.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.176
- My dog?
- Someday soon, I will be...

20:12.177 --> 20:15.479
- Tom...
- gone.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.014
- Tom...
- And when I am,

20:17.015 --> 20:19.450
Valentine is gonna
look for someone new.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.553
And that person is
going to become...

20:22.554 --> 20:24.321
Phoebe’s dad.

20:24.322 --> 20:29.226
He’s going to have breakfast
at my kitchen table,

20:29.227 --> 20:31.261
and sleep in my bed,

20:31.262 --> 20:33.363
and watch my little
girl grow up.

20:33.364 --> 20:36.768
He’s going to teach her
how to drive a car.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.939
She doesn’t even know
how to ride a bike yet.

20:45.176 --> 20:47.411
I’m not gonna be here for that.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.948
There are a thousand
of those things

20:50.949 --> 20:54.551
that I am not gonna
get a chance to see.

20:54.552 --> 20:57.988
I don’t know how to face this,

20:57.989 --> 21:01.191
knowing that the person
who might become her dad

21:01.192 --> 21:03.561
isn’t good enough.

21:05.263 --> 21:09.033
I need to have a say in
who raises my daughter.

21:13.338 --> 21:16.607
Tom, I’m... I’m honored.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.408
I mean, listen, I always
thought Val was hot,

21:18.409 --> 21:20.144
so that’s not gonna
be a problem,

21:20.145 --> 21:23.113
but for you to think I’d be
a good father for Phoebe,

21:23.114 --> 21:26.117
- I mean, I just...
- Not you.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.120
Fair enough.

21:31.523 --> 21:35.026
I’m going to find
my own replacement.

21:37.529 --> 21:41.799
Is this what your meeting
was about today?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.901
- Because if so...
- No, no.

21:43.902 --> 21:45.669
This is just something
Mac came up with.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.804
Yeah, right, it was my idea.

21:47.805 --> 21:49.339
You know, it’s, uh, funny.

21:49.340 --> 21:51.408
It’s for my YouTube channel.

21:51.409 --> 21:53.243
So, okay, let me
get this straight.

21:53.244 --> 21:56.413
You want to put pictures of me

21:56.414 --> 21:59.917
- on Singles.net?
- Mm-hmm.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.419
And then when guys come...

22:02.420 --> 22:06.557
- Then Mac jumps out and...
- Filming. I film.

22:06.558 --> 22:08.692
Yeah, the whole
thing’s being filmed,

22:08.693 --> 22:10.627
- like "Candid Camera" or one of those...
- Yeah, hilar...

22:10.628 --> 22:12.629
- It’ll be hilarious.
- It’s supposed to be funny.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.264
We haven’t figured out all...
the ending of it...

22:14.265 --> 22:16.567
There’s things, but
I’ll be funny.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.202
Okay...

22:18.203 --> 22:22.940
you’re not gonna use any
of the vacation photos?

22:22.941 --> 22:25.542
What? No.

22:25.543 --> 22:26.511
No.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.080
Okay. Well, then... pftt...

22:30.081 --> 22:33.550
cool. I mean, do what you want.

22:33.551 --> 22:36.954
I mean, nobody watches that
stupid channel anyway.

22:36.955 --> 22:39.157
- No offense.
- None taken.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.661
Ahem.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.731
You know, this whole
thing isn’t like you...

22:47.732 --> 22:49.700
like, at all.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.970
Sometimes people change.

22:52.971 --> 22:56.074
Mm-hmm. Not usually.

23:00.378 --> 23:03.046
Mac: All right. Singles.net.

23:03.047 --> 23:05.249
Gonna need name. Valen...

23:05.250 --> 23:07.651
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa.
What, are you nuts?

23:07.652 --> 23:09.052
Don’t use her real name.

23:09.053 --> 23:10.754
All right, fine.

23:10.755 --> 23:13.423
An alias, give me an alias.

23:13.424 --> 23:15.692
Um...

23:15.693 --> 23:17.794
I like Nina,

23:17.795 --> 23:19.597
Nina Blair.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.433
Nina. Okay. It’s
a sexy spy name.

23:23.434 --> 23:26.103
That works. Nina Blair.

23:26.104 --> 23:28.071
Okay, pic. Need a picture.

23:28.072 --> 23:30.507
Okay, here.

23:30.508 --> 23:31.975
Another one...

23:31.976 --> 23:33.310
- Uh...
- Okay, look.

23:33.311 --> 23:36.013
Here, this one. Right there.

23:36.014 --> 23:38.115
Not a chance. No.

23:38.116 --> 23:39.917
Look how much skin
she’s showing.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.184
Too much skin? Tom, I’ve seen

23:41.185 --> 23:42.953
Amish women in less than that.

23:42.954 --> 23:44.788
They’re gonna want to see
what she looks like, okay?

23:44.789 --> 23:46.658
They’re dudes.

23:48.626 --> 23:51.528
- Fine, fine. Use that one.
- Okay. All right.

23:51.529 --> 23:54.264
Oh, and one more thing
before I forget...

23:54.265 --> 23:56.734
This is a stupid idea!

23:57.869 --> 24:00.204
Now, interests.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.399
That’s just something
stupid Lexi left.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.371
Oh, yeah? Did Lexi do this, too?

25:10.108 --> 25:11.375
That’s what I thought.

25:11.376 --> 25:13.343
Ready to go pick out breakfast?

25:13.344 --> 25:14.512
Yeah.

25:22.253 --> 25:25.089
- Tom: Well?
- Phoebe: Not yet.

25:28.025 --> 25:30.026
That one...

25:30.027 --> 25:34.097
looks like pancakes.

25:34.098 --> 25:36.166
Really?

25:36.167 --> 25:38.268
I see oatmeal.

25:38.269 --> 25:41.405
Nope. It’s pancakes

25:41.406 --> 25:43.174
with chocolate chips.

25:45.209 --> 25:47.545
Those are huge chocolate chips.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.522
It’s not science, Daddy.

25:58.523 --> 26:01.258
- It’s cooking.
- I know.

26:01.259 --> 26:02.793
Mommy doesn’t measure.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.494
She doesn’t give you
chocolate chips

26:04.495 --> 26:06.564
while she’s doing it either.

26:07.632 --> 26:10.133
Sugar is her secret ingredient.

26:10.134 --> 26:13.370
Oh, yeah? You talk to Mom a lot.

26:13.371 --> 26:16.374
Does she ever tell you about
things that she likes?

26:18.309 --> 26:21.978
Like, I don’t know...

26:21.979 --> 26:25.949
Books or TV... outside stuff?

26:25.950 --> 26:28.685
Are you making a "hot list"?

26:28.686 --> 26:30.787
What is that?

26:30.788 --> 26:32.155
It’s from the magazine.

26:32.156 --> 26:35.792
A hot list is a list of things
that someone thinks is hot.

26:35.793 --> 26:38.261
It’s really cool.
Hanson Carter thinks

26:38.262 --> 26:41.698
Xbox, snowboarding,
and Iron Man are hot.

26:41.699 --> 26:44.201
Yeah, okay.

26:44.202 --> 26:48.104
So if I was making a
"hot list" for Mom,

26:48.105 --> 26:50.340
what do you think
might be on it?

26:50.341 --> 26:54.312
I don’t know. Ask Mom. Duh.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.417
Esteban, you know I don’t like

27:00.418 --> 27:01.952
the word no for an answer!

27:01.953 --> 27:05.689
Well, then let me say it
again in Spanish. No!

27:05.690 --> 27:08.425
Ha, that’s clever. Um,
what if I told you

27:08.426 --> 27:10.760
that we had Val Bishop on board?

27:10.761 --> 27:13.663
I’d ask if you got her drunk.

27:13.664 --> 27:17.300
I am totally sober, Esteban.

27:17.301 --> 27:19.336
Esteban, come on, please!

27:19.337 --> 27:22.573
Just take one chance
in your life.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.277
My wife’s gonna kill me.

27:31.549 --> 27:34.217
Um, Esteban, I think you
made a very wise decision,

27:34.218 --> 27:35.619
and Val and I will
not let you down,

27:35.620 --> 27:36.887
and we are super excited,

27:36.888 --> 27:38.288
and we’ll send you
paperwork tomorrow,

27:38.289 --> 27:39.856
and I’m gonna get
off the phone now

27:39.857 --> 27:41.157
before you change your mind.
Bye. Thank you.

27:41.158 --> 27:43.193
What?!

27:43.194 --> 27:44.494
I’m sweating.

27:44.495 --> 27:45.896
- You’re sweating?
- Yes.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.664
You’re sweating because
you’re nervous,

27:47.665 --> 27:49.366
and now we have good news.
And this is great news,

27:49.367 --> 27:52.602
because between you and
me and Esteban, right,

27:52.603 --> 27:56.106
we’re gonna have the best
menu, the best restaurant.

27:56.107 --> 27:58.174
This is gonna be
frickin’ amazing.

27:58.175 --> 27:59.576
Now we just have to
think of a name.

27:59.577 --> 28:03.280
I thought we decided on, uh...
"Michael’s."

28:03.281 --> 28:07.317
Oh, right, right. You
were also flying

28:07.318 --> 28:09.819
when you were having
that dream, right?

28:09.820 --> 28:12.789
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Do we have an opening date?

28:12.790 --> 28:13.624
March.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.458
- March?
- Opening month.

28:15.459 --> 28:16.927
We’re gonna miss
Valentine’s Day.

28:16.928 --> 28:19.396
Michael, it’s better,
because, God, remember

28:19.397 --> 28:22.032
when we used to work at Maury’s?

28:22.033 --> 28:26.336
Oh, yeah, Maury. He would say
that "V-Day was like D-Day..."

28:26.337 --> 28:27.571
"Only vurse!"

28:27.572 --> 28:28.672
- That’s right.
- Yeah.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.540
So, you know, it’s too crazy.

28:30.541 --> 28:32.375
Plus, you know, as Tom says,

28:32.376 --> 28:34.477
Valentine’s Day is just
a "made-up holiday

28:34.478 --> 28:36.580
so lesser artists can
sell greeting cards."

28:36.581 --> 28:40.183
What a romantic.

28:40.184 --> 28:45.889
I truly believe that this place
is gonna be so much better,

28:45.890 --> 28:49.225
and I also think that I’m the
luckiest guy in the world

28:49.226 --> 28:51.629
to have you as a partner
to do this with.

28:53.864 --> 28:56.066
You. Oh, I...

28:56.067 --> 28:58.201
- I feel the same way.
- Good.

28:58.202 --> 29:00.271
Um, I gotta go.

29:01.739 --> 29:02.739
Ooh.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.175
All right.

29:05.176 --> 29:06.911
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:55.820 --> 30:59.156
When I said we needed chairs
for the restaurant...

31:00.891 --> 31:04.861
- Spring-loaded.
- Yes, it is. Okay.

31:04.862 --> 31:07.697
Let’s, uh, go back
to the warehouse,

31:07.698 --> 31:10.867
and we will start all over.
Cool?

31:10.868 --> 31:12.703
You got it, man.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.407
Hey, Tom.

31:17.408 --> 31:20.143
- Hey, it’s Michael, right?
- That’s right,

31:20.144 --> 31:22.546
and you got it on the
first try this time.

31:24.348 --> 31:26.751
She’s in the back. Follow me.

31:29.987 --> 31:31.888
Sí, pero...

31:31.889 --> 31:34.157
uh, ¿tienes...
gluten-free flour?

31:34.158 --> 31:38.161
-Veinticinco pounds.
- Val, someone’s here to see you.

31:38.162 --> 31:40.130
I don’t... I’m all
out of my Spanish.

31:40.131 --> 31:42.866
I don’t know if I’m getting a
discount or buying his boat.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.467
Yeah, it’s... it’s Tom.

31:44.468 --> 31:46.704
Sí, but...

31:48.572 --> 31:51.674
necesito veinte cajas de tomates

31:51.675 --> 31:54.377
y diez cajas de lechuga...

31:54.378 --> 31:55.879
- See you, Tom.
- Hey, you, too.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.580
Pero organic, por favor.

31:57.581 --> 32:00.116
Uh, cebollas también.

32:00.117 --> 32:01.417
Okay?

32:01.418 --> 32:02.819
Gracias.

32:02.820 --> 32:06.422
Okay. Gracias. Bye.

32:06.423 --> 32:08.424
- Hey!
- Hey.

32:08.425 --> 32:10.460
What are you doing here?

32:10.461 --> 32:12.762
I just realized today
that I haven’t

32:12.763 --> 32:16.032
visited you at work in a while.

32:16.033 --> 32:18.101
Ever.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.202
Right.

32:19.203 --> 32:22.405
So I figured I’d stop
by and say hello.

32:22.406 --> 32:24.774
Is everything okay?

32:24.775 --> 32:27.310
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

32:27.311 --> 32:28.545
I thought maybe we could go

32:28.546 --> 32:31.314
grab a cup of coffee.

32:31.315 --> 32:33.349
Talk.

32:33.350 --> 32:35.285
Coffee?

32:35.286 --> 32:37.087
Yeah.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.670
So...

32:54.672 --> 32:57.407
how is work coming?

32:57.408 --> 33:00.778
You made any progress
on the painting?

33:02.112 --> 33:04.647
I haven’t really thought
about it all that much.

33:04.648 --> 33:06.950
- Hmm.
- What about you?

33:06.951 --> 33:09.220
How’s... how’s the
restaurant coming?

33:10.554 --> 33:13.157
It’s good.

33:14.491 --> 33:17.026
Okay.

33:17.027 --> 33:18.728
Mm-hmm.

33:18.729 --> 33:21.598
Um, okay.

33:21.599 --> 33:24.500
How is it good?

33:24.501 --> 33:28.071
It’s... fine.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.841
I mean, I like it... I like it.

33:35.246 --> 33:37.881
I don’t...

33:37.882 --> 33:41.451
I’m trying to...
catch up with you,

33:41.452 --> 33:45.221
and I don’t... apparently,
I don’t know how to do it.

33:45.222 --> 33:47.925
Okay. Well, um...

33:50.261 --> 33:52.095
what would you like
to talk about?

33:52.096 --> 33:54.430
Oh, fiddlesticks.

33:54.431 --> 33:55.900
No idea.

33:57.668 --> 34:00.336
Just leave it.

34:00.337 --> 34:05.208
So how’s that fake dating
project with Mac going?

34:05.209 --> 34:07.977
Um...

34:07.978 --> 34:11.514
it’s progressing slowly.
It’s Mac.

34:11.514 --> 34:13.116
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

34:13.117 --> 34:15.752
still working on it.

34:15.753 --> 34:18.521
Sounds painful.

34:18.522 --> 34:20.724
It has its moments.

34:21.592 --> 34:22.927
Hmm.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.900
"Fiddlesticks"?

34:30.900 --> 34:34.504
Val: It...

34:34.505 --> 34:36.239
- You said that.
- Yeah.

34:43.947 --> 34:46.617
- Fiddlesticks?
- Yeah.

35:03.033 --> 35:05.501
TV host: So was it crazy...

35:05.502 --> 35:08.538
Man on TV: Things, you know, don’t
change in that department, uh...

35:08.539 --> 35:10.506
Your wife is...

35:10.507 --> 35:12.375
Your wife’s gonna be
listening to this.

35:12.376 --> 35:16.579
-My wife appreciates the fact...
- 104?

35:16.580 --> 35:19.749
104 winks in an hour.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.718
Come on. Let’s make our picks.

35:21.719 --> 35:26.155
Tom, I... I can’t...
I’m working.

35:26.156 --> 35:28.791
What? This is how
comedians work.

35:28.792 --> 35:30.994
Think I want to eat
pizza and watch TV?

35:30.995 --> 35:32.795
TV host: Yeah, any stalkers?
Anybody...

35:32.796 --> 35:35.832
All right, fine. I
needed a break anyway.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.102
- Ahem.
- Let’s go.

35:52.783 --> 35:54.617
Sorry.

35:54.618 --> 35:59.389
Oh, you’re lucky you had a
clip-on at our wedding.

35:59.390 --> 36:00.723
Yeah.

36:00.724 --> 36:02.992
And you’re lucky
that Phoebe and Lexi

36:02.993 --> 36:07.764
gave me a 10-minute
sleepover mommy break.

36:07.765 --> 36:10.266
Ooh...

36:10.267 --> 36:12.268
You really going
through with this?

36:12.269 --> 36:15.271
It seems like a fun idea.

36:15.272 --> 36:18.608
See, that’s what I mean.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.610
That is not the Tom I know.

36:20.611 --> 36:22.845
You never dress up for me,

36:22.846 --> 36:24.313
and Mac asks you to,

36:24.314 --> 36:26.417
and suddenly you’re Dapper Dan.

36:30.187 --> 36:32.956
Something up?

36:34.324 --> 36:36.460
What do you mean?

36:37.928 --> 36:40.396
I don’t know.

36:40.397 --> 36:45.768
I’m not sure what’s
really going on,

36:45.769 --> 36:49.039
but, um...

36:50.741 --> 36:54.845
sometimes when people
drift apart, uh...

36:56.213 --> 36:58.047
sometimes when
people drift apart,

36:58.048 --> 37:01.251
the distance isn’t as big
as you imagine it to be.

37:03.454 --> 37:05.889
Did we drift apart?

37:06.924 --> 37:09.093
Little bit.

37:14.598 --> 37:17.468
But I like this.

37:20.237 --> 37:23.841
I like that you’re interested
in me all of a sudden.

37:25.075 --> 37:27.710
I like that we went
to coffee, but I...

37:27.711 --> 37:31.081
I like that you like it.

37:33.884 --> 37:37.488
Why do I get the feeling like
you’re hiding something?

37:38.756 --> 37:42.893
Something really bad.

37:52.736 --> 37:54.505
Val...

38:05.616 --> 38:07.351
This one’s new.

38:08.685 --> 38:11.187
- Hmm?
- This.

38:11.188 --> 38:12.922
Uh, no.

38:12.923 --> 38:15.925
Phoebe gave it to me
last Mother’s Day.

38:15.926 --> 38:18.228
It’s a paintbrush.

38:19.463 --> 38:22.499
"So you’ll always
have Daddy around."

38:30.741 --> 38:32.442
Tom.

38:37.314 --> 38:38.949
Hmm?

38:40.217 --> 38:44.021
Everything’s under
control, Val, like always.

38:47.457 --> 38:49.560
I have to go.

39:07.077 --> 39:10.080
- Oh, hey, here he is.
- All right.

39:17.754 --> 39:20.089
What are you doing? You’re
actually gonna film this?

39:20.090 --> 39:22.292
Go get him, tiger.
Make this happen.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.897
- Man: Hey.
- Hey

39:27.898 --> 39:29.732
Can I get a bourbon neat?

39:29.733 --> 39:31.401
Just well is fine.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.440
Thank you.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.876
Excuse me. I’m saving
that for somebody.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.911
I know.

39:41.912 --> 39:44.580
Nina, right?

39:44.581 --> 39:49.452
You’re Dan, and...

39:49.453 --> 39:52.154
you’re here to meet Nina.

39:52.155 --> 39:54.757
And this is what I get
for trying new things...

39:54.758 --> 39:56.492
- Lunatics.
- No, no, no, no.

39:56.493 --> 39:59.061
Listen, I’m Nina.

39:59.062 --> 40:00.563
Just back away.

40:00.564 --> 40:04.066
Whoa. Obviously, I’m not Nina.

40:04.067 --> 40:06.469
I mean, Nina isn’t even Nina.
Nina is Valentine.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.437
- Get out of my way.
- Hang on, please, please.

40:08.438 --> 40:11.674
Listen. I’m not some
freaky, weird guy here.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.309
- Just hear me out, okay, Dan?
- Mm-hmm.

40:13.310 --> 40:15.745
- My name is Tom.
- Mm-hmm.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.247
Valentine is my wife,

40:18.248 --> 40:22.719
and I think you might
be perfect for her.

40:27.924 --> 40:29.226
Okay.

40:31.361 --> 40:34.664
Believe it or not,
this is the best date

40:34.665 --> 40:36.932
I’ve ever been on
from Singles.net.

40:36.933 --> 40:38.567
Stop that.

40:38.568 --> 40:40.236
And cut.

40:40.237 --> 40:41.904
Want to see the...
Want to see the punch?

40:41.905 --> 40:44.006
- I don’t want to see the punch.
- Slow motion.

40:44.007 --> 40:45.375
You deserved it.

41:29.853 --> 41:32.455
Mac: Chemo? Really?

41:32.456 --> 41:35.424
Why did you think doing this
by yourself was a good idea?

41:35.425 --> 41:37.460
All right? Do you know
how dumb you have to be

41:37.461 --> 41:40.029
for me to be the
responsible one, Tom?

41:40.030 --> 41:41.163
Monumentally dumb!

41:41.164 --> 41:43.532
That’s how dumb you have to be.

41:43.533 --> 41:46.669
Val should be there
with you, okay?

41:46.670 --> 41:49.638
I need to spend
more time with her.

41:49.639 --> 41:52.074
Okay, good, okay. This is
what I’m saying, yes...

41:52.075 --> 41:55.244
So I can find better
matches on Singles.net.

41:55.245 --> 41:57.513
You’re still a lunatic.

41:57.514 --> 42:00.182
Gotta get the profile
perfect, Mac.

42:00.183 --> 42:02.451
She’s at the park right
now with Phoebe.

42:02.452 --> 42:04.186
Listen, Tom, I did two semesters

42:04.187 --> 42:06.188
of psychology at
Trenton State, okay?

42:06.189 --> 42:08.724
This is what we call
"classic avoidance."

42:08.725 --> 42:11.660
I am not taking you to the park.

42:11.661 --> 42:13.663
Brynn is with them.

42:14.931 --> 42:16.298
I’ll be honest, Val.

42:16.299 --> 42:19.101
It all sounds suspicious.

42:19.102 --> 42:21.904
Yeah, I was worried
you’d say that.

42:21.905 --> 42:25.107
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:25.108 --> 42:27.611
Honestly...

42:29.179 --> 42:30.980
this is gonna sound weird,

42:30.981 --> 42:32.982
but as big as the pit is

42:32.983 --> 42:34.283
in my stomach right now,

42:34.284 --> 42:37.820
I’m actually enjoying him.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.723
Is that weird?

42:41.291 --> 42:43.859
Well, then I guess you’ll
just have to decide.

42:43.860 --> 42:46.997
Are you waiting on a bad
surprise or a good surprise?

42:49.066 --> 42:51.066
Daddy! Daddy!

42:51.067 --> 42:53.502
So we... we asked
the park ranger

42:53.503 --> 42:55.004
where the prettiest
flowers were,

42:55.005 --> 42:56.672
and he said it was you guys...
girls.

42:56.673 --> 42:58.707
Thought you had a meeting.

42:58.708 --> 43:00.009
- Huh?
- Meeting.

43:00.010 --> 43:01.944
With Biron.

43:01.945 --> 43:03.847
Oh, right. Yeah,
he had to cancel.

43:05.715 --> 43:07.850
Daddy, come play with
me on the playground.

43:07.851 --> 43:11.086
Uh, Daddy’s feeling a
little tired, baby.

43:11.087 --> 43:13.122
I’ll be over in a few minutes.

43:13.123 --> 43:15.425
I’ll play with you, Pheebs.

43:16.993 --> 43:19.396
Well, are you coming or not?

43:25.202 --> 43:26.569
So you gotta show
’em how it’s done.

43:26.570 --> 43:28.437
He’s really bad. He’s really...

43:28.438 --> 43:30.707
- Mac: I’m not bad.
- All right, all right.

43:35.278 --> 43:37.514
You okay?

43:39.783 --> 43:41.384
Yeah.

43:42.385 --> 43:44.353
You don’t look so good.

43:44.354 --> 43:47.256
Oh, God... are you
smoking again?

43:47.257 --> 43:50.559
No, no. I’m not smoking again.

43:50.560 --> 43:54.231
Just... I’m just tired, is all.

43:55.232 --> 43:56.433
Okay.

43:57.734 --> 43:59.870
Still haven’t taken
down that awful fence.

44:01.204 --> 44:04.039
Oh, that’s right. That’s right.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.275
This is "the most aesthetically

44:06.276 --> 44:07.977
unappealing park
in Los Angeles."

44:07.978 --> 44:09.512
Just because you say it that way

44:09.513 --> 44:12.182
doesn’t mean it isn’t true.

44:13.483 --> 44:15.852
What are you doing here?

44:20.090 --> 44:21.590
Do you remember in college

44:21.591 --> 44:24.827
when you were on the
all-girls bowling team?

44:24.828 --> 44:27.363
Yeah.

44:27.364 --> 44:29.099
Well, whatever happened to that?

44:31.268 --> 44:34.236
Do you still bowl?

44:34.237 --> 44:38.241
Have you seen me bowl lately?

44:41.378 --> 44:43.145
We should bowl.

44:43.146 --> 44:44.547
- We should bowl?
- Mm-hmm.

44:44.548 --> 44:46.550
Let’s go bowling.

44:52.489 --> 44:55.891
Tom: Now I see why
you quit bowling.

44:55.892 --> 44:57.960
You stink.

44:57.961 --> 44:59.995
But I’m winning,

44:59.996 --> 45:02.531
so that means you stink...

45:02.532 --> 45:06.869
More than you do. But these are...
these are artist’s hands.

45:06.870 --> 45:08.370
They’re not meant for bowling.

45:08.371 --> 45:10.873
Oh, no.

45:10.874 --> 45:13.509
All right, last frame.

45:13.510 --> 45:14.610
- Last chance for glory.
- Okay.

45:14.611 --> 45:16.479
Do something special, Val.

45:24.154 --> 45:27.156
- Ah!
- Whoo!

45:27.157 --> 45:29.025
Nice!

45:30.193 --> 45:32.294
Now that is more like it.

45:32.295 --> 45:33.429
- Okay.
- Thank you.

45:33.430 --> 45:35.497
You bowl one more strike,

45:35.498 --> 45:37.934
I have to make out with you
when we get to the car.

45:41.438 --> 45:44.273
And if I don’t bowl a strike?

45:44.274 --> 45:45.809
You...

45:52.382 --> 45:54.451
Never mind.

46:00.690 --> 46:03.927
I love bowling all of a sudden.

46:15.805 --> 46:17.640
Dang.

46:17.641 --> 46:21.076
Looks like I’m
buying pizza, huh?

46:21.077 --> 46:22.911
Not while we’re bowling.

46:22.912 --> 46:26.016
What’s the matter with you?
Greases up the fingers.

46:29.386 --> 46:31.820
Move.

46:31.821 --> 46:36.458
So, Glen, what else do
you do besides bowling?

46:36.459 --> 46:38.360
Oh, you want to
chat a little bit,

46:38.361 --> 46:41.297
share our feelings? Is
that what you want to do?

46:41.298 --> 46:42.765
Because I’m here to bowl, okay?

46:42.766 --> 46:45.034
I let you talk me
into this date.

46:45.035 --> 46:48.003
I’ll be damned if I’m gonna
let you ruin my bowling.

46:48.004 --> 46:50.239
Step over there.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.474
Further. You’re all
up on my back.

46:52.475 --> 46:56.479
Get... sit down. Sit down.

Really funny.

47:40.023 --> 47:41.423
Tom, listen.

47:41.424 --> 47:44.626
"Winelover61" is officially...

47:44.627 --> 47:46.528
20 minutes late.

47:46.529 --> 47:48.330
He’s not gonna make the tasting.

47:48.331 --> 47:49.832
Take me to the wine tasting.

47:49.833 --> 47:51.834
I drink the wine for free.

47:51.835 --> 47:53.035
- It’s not a date.
- Mm-mm.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.436
It’s just me drinking wine.

47:54.437 --> 47:56.573
It’s not that big a deal.

48:01.778 --> 48:04.047
Tom.

48:05.281 --> 48:07.150
Biron: Hey.

48:08.318 --> 48:10.552
Tom?

48:10.553 --> 48:13.088
Where’s he going?

48:13.089 --> 48:17.026
Hey, uh, you know where I can
get some condoms around here?

48:18.361 --> 48:21.830
You look nothing
like your picture.

48:21.831 --> 48:23.665

48:46.156 --> 48:49.491
Down. Sink lower.

48:49.492 --> 48:52.661
Oh... no, thank you.

48:52.662 --> 48:54.630
You are smoking
again, aren’t you?

48:54.631 --> 48:58.500
Not smoking, just old.

48:58.501 --> 48:59.668
All right.

48:59.669 --> 49:01.904
Got an easy one for

49:33.570 --> 49:35.972
but, dude, imagine
the dinosaurs.

49:37.073 --> 49:40.476
Yoga one day, extinct the next.

49:40.477 --> 49:43.478
- Dinosaurs doing yoga?
- Exactly.

49:43.479 --> 49:45.314
They weren’t promised tomorrow.

49:45.315 --> 49:47.015
Neither were we.

49:47.016 --> 49:49.852
What is the best way to
make God laugh, Tom?

49:49.853 --> 49:51.854
What?

49:51.855 --> 49:55.792
Best way to make God
laugh is to make a plan.

49:58.428 --> 50:00.662
That said,

50:00.663 --> 50:02.731
your wife is smoking crazy hot,

50:02.732 --> 50:04.967
so if your offer is a
real one, you can...

50:04.968 --> 50:06.702
You can tell her she just found

50:06.703 --> 50:09.772
a brand-new downward-facing dog.

50:19.282 --> 50:23.285
I don’t think Cindy ever
really even loved him.

50:23.286 --> 50:25.654
I think she was just doing
it for the publicity.

50:25.655 --> 50:28.423
Daddy, you always
think the worst.

50:28.424 --> 50:30.325
Maybe it just didn’t work out.

50:30.326 --> 50:31.760
Maybe.

50:31.761 --> 50:32.761
Didn’t work out with who?

50:32.762 --> 50:34.529
Who are you talking about?

50:34.530 --> 50:36.999
- Hanson...
- Carter.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.767
- Tom, Phoebe: Duh.
- Val: Oh.

50:38.768 --> 50:41.603
You know what? Why don’t
you just ask him yourself?

50:41.604 --> 50:46.208
Right. When would I ever
get to meet Hanson?

50:46.209 --> 50:49.711
Well, his mall tour
starts next week

50:49.712 --> 50:51.914
at our mall...

50:51.915 --> 50:54.751
on Valentine’s Day...

50:55.618 --> 50:56.618
and you’re going!

50:56.619 --> 50:59.454
What?!

50:59.455 --> 51:00.956
What?

51:00.957 --> 51:02.858
I read about it in "Teen Scene."

51:02.859 --> 51:05.060
- "Teen Scene"?
- Yes.

51:05.061 --> 51:07.863
Oh, my God!

51:07.864 --> 51:09.631
- I have to go call Lexi.
- Okay!

51:09.632 --> 51:12.868
- Phoebe: Yeah!
- Tom: Go call Lexi.

51:12.869 --> 51:16.339
- Daddy, thank you!
- You’re welcome!

51:18.908 --> 51:20.609
Wow.

51:20.610 --> 51:21.610
Good, right?

51:21.611 --> 51:23.879
Eh, pretty good.

51:23.880 --> 51:26.950
We should... what?

51:29.218 --> 51:31.253
Huh? What’s...

51:31.254 --> 51:33.789
- What...?
- Okay, hear me out.

51:33.790 --> 51:36.692
I know you hate Valentine’s Day

51:36.693 --> 51:39.061
because of your name and...

51:39.062 --> 51:41.331
It’s not because of my name.

51:43.066 --> 51:46.635
You try making 900 orders
of tortellini in two hours.

51:46.636 --> 51:49.738
But can I at least
get you to agree

51:49.739 --> 51:52.809
to go on a date with
me on the 14th?

51:54.811 --> 51:56.078
Phoebe’s gonna be
at the concert.

51:56.079 --> 51:58.480
I talked to Brynn.
She’s gonna take her,

51:58.481 --> 52:00.616
which gives us the night.

52:01.718 --> 52:03.885
You never want to do anything.

52:03.886 --> 52:05.821
Neither do you.

52:05.822 --> 52:09.157
You want to take me out
for Valentine’s Day?

52:09.158 --> 52:10.225
Mm-hmm.

52:10.226 --> 52:14.563
I’m not gonna lie. I
am confused, but...

52:14.564 --> 52:17.734
I am going with it.

52:21.437 --> 52:23.438
How do you do that?

52:23.439 --> 52:25.340
Do what?

52:25.341 --> 52:29.979
Let yourself be carried
away by life like that?

52:30.847 --> 52:33.482
I don’t know.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.650
Do you ever get tired

52:35.651 --> 52:39.021
of paddling against the current?

52:39.022 --> 52:42.958
You stop paddling, you drown.

52:42.959 --> 52:46.162
I’m breathing just fine.

52:51.367 --> 52:53.502
Yeah.

52:53.503 --> 52:56.171
I do get tired sometimes.

52:56.172 --> 52:57.873
I wish I didn’t have
to be that way.

52:57.874 --> 52:59.074
You don’t.

52:59.075 --> 53:00.977
You could talk to me.

53:02.845 --> 53:05.448
Talk to me.

53:14.824 --> 53:17.293
Yeah...

53:21.431 --> 53:22.432
Ahem.

53:26.569 --> 53:28.270
- Michael.
- Tom.

53:28.271 --> 53:30.472
- Val: Mike?
- Hey, come in. Come on.

53:30.473 --> 53:32.474
Thanks.

53:32.475 --> 53:33.608
Whew.

53:33.609 --> 53:35.977
Oh, my God. Is something wrong?

53:35.978 --> 53:38.980
Oh, no. No, no. Um...

53:38.981 --> 53:40.682
you left your phone
at the restaurant,

53:40.683 --> 53:43.685
so I just didn’t
want you to worry.

53:43.686 --> 53:45.955
I put Saran Wrap on it.

53:47.223 --> 53:50.392
Mike, I could have gone
a day without my phone.

53:50.393 --> 53:54.129
Or just use the
Find My iPhone app.

53:54.130 --> 53:57.232
The... come on, Val.
It was in the manual.

53:57.233 --> 53:59.367
We can track our phones.

53:59.368 --> 54:00.469
Ah-choo!

54:00.470 --> 54:02.537
Did you drive down here
with the top open?

54:02.538 --> 54:04.573
Um... ah-choo!

54:04.574 --> 54:06.242
Mm.

54:07.477 --> 54:09.345
Top’s broken.

54:10.413 --> 54:12.415
Mike.

54:20.923 --> 54:22.757
- Thank you.
- Just...

54:22.758 --> 54:24.192
It’s no problem.

54:24.193 --> 54:26.261
I just didn’t want you to worry

54:26.262 --> 54:28.263
and you needed it and
then an accident happened

54:28.264 --> 54:30.399
and you didn’t have it
or something, so...

54:32.201 --> 54:33.768
I, uh...

54:33.769 --> 54:35.304
just...

54:36.606 --> 54:39.007
Okay, I’m gonna go back
to the restaurant.

54:39.008 --> 54:42.378
- I’ll drive you.
- No, I’m good. It’s... it’s letting up.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.054
Yeah.

55:00.429 --> 55:01.430
Okay...

55:03.799 --> 55:05.767
this is the point in the date

55:05.768 --> 55:09.005
where I like to give the speech.

55:14.310 --> 55:18.346
"I would like to introduce
you to my wife.

55:18.347 --> 55:20.081
She is young,

55:20.082 --> 55:21.917
she’s beautiful,

55:21.918 --> 55:24.619
and pretty soon,

55:24.620 --> 55:27.356
she’s going to be a widow.

55:28.858 --> 55:31.359
I haven’t told her this yet,

55:31.360 --> 55:34.029
but every doctor that
I have talked to

55:34.030 --> 55:35.630
has told me the same thing...

55:35.631 --> 55:37.465
Nine months to a year.

55:37.466 --> 55:39.835
And when that happens,

55:39.836 --> 55:43.738
Valentine is going to be alone.

55:43.739 --> 55:47.944
You’re dying? You’re dying.

55:52.014 --> 55:55.218
Man, I’m so sorry.

55:57.353 --> 55:59.488
Do you like her?

56:01.224 --> 56:04.060
Do I like your wife?

56:08.764 --> 56:09.898
Sure.

56:09.899 --> 56:11.933
I mean, we get along
great at work.

56:11.934 --> 56:12.934
She’s terrific.

56:12.935 --> 56:15.070
I mean, she’s a genius.

56:15.071 --> 56:17.172
Really, this restaurant’s
just gonna...

56:17.173 --> 56:19.408
take off, but...

56:30.987 --> 56:33.822
Yeah, I like her, Tom.

56:33.823 --> 56:36.324
She’s the whole package,
but you know that.

56:36.325 --> 56:37.693
That’s why you married her.

56:42.064 --> 56:45.368
We’re friends. I mean...

56:46.869 --> 56:49.271
maybe under different
circumstances...

56:49.272 --> 56:51.439
Wait. How would you
want to meet her

56:51.440 --> 56:54.043
under "different circumstances"?

56:57.513 --> 57:00.649
If I said yes, which I’m not,

57:00.650 --> 57:02.618
how would this work?

57:05.021 --> 57:09.491
You, me, and Val would
spend time together,

57:09.492 --> 57:13.228
and I would watch the
two of you together,

57:13.229 --> 57:17.199
and if it felt right...

57:18.334 --> 57:21.169
then I would introduce
you to Phoebe.

57:21.170 --> 57:24.506
And if my baby girl thinks

57:24.507 --> 57:28.810
you’re the best thing
since Hanson Carter,

57:28.811 --> 57:31.547
- then...
- Then what?

57:33.049 --> 57:35.318
Then you would just hand
over the keys to your house?

57:37.119 --> 57:42.724
Then I would tell Val...

57:42.725 --> 57:45.694
how I feel... Tell
her that I like you,

57:45.695 --> 57:48.397
plant the seeds.

57:49.799 --> 57:51.767
Whew. Okay.

57:53.135 --> 57:54.936
What about Val?

57:54.937 --> 57:57.739
- Does she know about any of this?
- No.

57:57.740 --> 58:00.842
She doesn’t, and I would
like to keep it that way,

58:00.843 --> 58:04.279
- even after.
- This is so out there, Tom.

58:04.280 --> 58:07.682
I mean, I’m truly sorry
for your situation,

58:07.683 --> 58:10.119
I am, but...

58:11.620 --> 58:15.658
this has "disaster"
written all over it.

58:20.529 --> 58:23.532
Let me show you something.

58:26.836 --> 58:29.437
You film me one more time...

58:29.438 --> 58:30.939
No, okay.

58:30.940 --> 58:33.241
Um, uh, okay!

58:33.242 --> 58:34.576
- Phoebe: You ready?
- We’re ready.

58:34.577 --> 58:36.077
Val: No, no. On the
count of three!

58:36.078 --> 58:37.312
- Tom: Okay.
- Val: Okay.

58:37.313 --> 58:41.416
Val, Tom: 1, 2, 3.

58:41.417 --> 58:44.285
Val: ♪ Here comes the bride

58:44.286 --> 58:46.788
♪ All dressed in white... ♪

58:46.789 --> 58:48.891
Val’s wedding dress.

58:50.126 --> 58:52.694
Phoebe wanted to
feel like a bride.

58:52.695 --> 58:56.766
Val: Let me see your
shoes and the veil.

58:59.602 --> 59:01.936
Oh, perfect, darling.

59:01.937 --> 59:04.072
Oh, gorgeous.

59:04.073 --> 59:06.341
Daddy, put the camera down.

59:06.342 --> 59:08.544
You have to give me away.

59:17.353 --> 59:20.356
I had to stop, because...

59:21.524 --> 59:23.459
I’m never gonna see that.

59:30.066 --> 59:32.300
Michael...

59:32.301 --> 59:35.170
the thing that I have
figured out from all this

59:35.171 --> 59:39.874
is if you have a chance

59:39.875 --> 59:42.644
to love somebody,

59:42.645 --> 59:44.913
you gotta take it...

59:44.914 --> 59:46.080
and hold on to it.

59:46.081 --> 59:48.083
You can’t take it for granted.

59:48.084 --> 59:51.853
Don’t tell me you
don’t want this,

59:51.854 --> 59:54.623
because you’ll live to
regret it or worse.

01:00:06.068 --> 01:00:08.170
So how do we do this?

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:16.478
- Tom: Welcome to
the dream date.

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.880
- Tom: You heard it.
- Val: All right.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.749
- What’s up, Mac?
- Mike: What you got?

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:26.355
- Tom: Anytime.
- This is killing me.

01:00:29.925 --> 01:00:32.161
- Hmm.
- Brynn: Babe...

01:00:33.095 --> 01:00:35.330
Not bad. Not bad at all.

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.931
Not great at all.

01:00:36.932 --> 01:00:40.935
So you guys do this
every Friday night?

01:00:40.936 --> 01:00:42.470
Yeah.

01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:46.341
Really? That’s cool. Thank
you for inviting me.

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:48.510
Thanks for coming, man.

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:50.546
- You’re up.
- I’m up.

01:00:51.614 --> 01:00:52.748
I’m up.

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:56.819
Oh, I got this.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:02.258
Bear with me.

01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.328
Val: What?

01:01:07.329 --> 01:01:08.663
Brynn: Oh.

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:11.599
- What?
- "Zizivah."

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.569
- "Zizivah"?
- It’s a type of weevil.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:17.138
A weevil’s a kind of beetle.

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:19.741
There are kinds of beetles?

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.075
Yeah.

01:01:21.076 --> 01:01:22.176
Tom: And you know this?

01:01:22.177 --> 01:01:24.245
I can’t even count that high.

01:01:24.246 --> 01:01:25.346
This actually reminds me

01:01:25.347 --> 01:01:27.215
of Esteban trying
to cut an onion.

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.850
"Valentine..."

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.287
"Valentine, I think I cut
my thumb off again."

01:01:35.157 --> 01:01:36.624
That’s actually funny.

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:38.226
You know, if you cursed more,

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.395
I think you could open for me.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:41.896
Thanks, man.

01:01:41.897 --> 01:01:44.799
- Who’s Esteban?
- Val: He’s...

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.768
He does it a lot.

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:47.869
Esteban is great at start-ups,

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.939
bad at slicing.

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:54.777
Okay. Your turn.

01:02:08.924 --> 01:02:12.660
I learned this. It’s
called the slide.

01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:15.964
You learn well. That is perfect.

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.734
Mike: Pretty, right?

01:02:24.506 --> 01:02:27.476
Mike: No, you didn’t!

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:49.864
- Mike: Terrible.
- Val: Terrible.

01:02:49.865 --> 01:02:50.666
Hey.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.200
Hi. Hi. You scared me.

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:54.403
We got it.

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:58.606
We got this. Come on.
I’ll walk you out.

01:02:58.607 --> 01:03:01.309
- All right.
- Okay.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.610
Um, thank you for
a lovely evening,

01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:04.131
- and I’ll see you Monday.
- Thank you.

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.316
- I had fun. This was fun.
- Me, too.

01:03:09.184 --> 01:03:11.854
Okay. Bye.

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:19.527
You were so right! I
just had to loosen up

01:03:19.528 --> 01:03:20.862
and... and be myself
and try not to think

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.597
about how weird
this whole thing is

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:23.965
so I can actually
have a good time.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.533
She’s not yours yet.

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:27.670
Excuse me?

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:30.104
She’s still my wife.

01:03:30.105 --> 01:03:31.973
I know. I was just saying...

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:35.376
No, I’m just saying that as
long as I’m still alive,

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:38.913
you keep things
respectful, okay?

01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:42.750
You know, I... I don’t get you.

01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:44.852
You talk me into this thing,

01:03:44.853 --> 01:03:46.621
and then when it goes
the way that you want,

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.189
you all of a sudden
can’t handle it.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:50.858
I can handle it fine. I
just don’t want you to...

01:03:50.859 --> 01:03:53.194
You don’t want what?
You don’t want what?

01:03:53.195 --> 01:03:55.196
You don’t want me beating
you at Scrabble,

01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:57.398
cleaning up bottles?

01:03:57.399 --> 01:04:00.201
Tom, you have...

01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:02.236
You have such a wonderful wife.

01:04:02.237 --> 01:04:03.738
Yeah, I know how great she is.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:07.109
Do you? Do you know
how great she is?

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:13.047
Listen...

01:04:13.048 --> 01:04:17.618
you either want this,
or you don’t, okay?

01:04:17.619 --> 01:04:20.588
If you want to stop this,
then I’ll respect you,

01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:22.990
but you need to make
your mind up, damn it.

01:04:22.991 --> 01:04:26.728
’Cause every moment
that I spend with her,

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.964
I’m greedy for another.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.618
Michael, wait up a second.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.730
I can’t believe I’m out with
my guy on Valentine’s Day.

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:04.799
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.735
Mm-hmm.

01:05:07.636 --> 01:05:10.238
Where are we?

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:14.008
I found this great, little
out-of-the-way place.

01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:16.544
It’s brand-new, was
supposed to be closed,

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.780
but I have an in with
the owners, so...

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:21.015
Oh, Tom, the chefs and
the waiters and...

01:05:21.016 --> 01:05:24.285
Ah, they were more than happy to do it.
Trust me.

01:05:24.286 --> 01:05:26.855
Hm... what’s the name of it?

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:32.393
You really have no
sense of direction.

01:05:32.394 --> 01:05:35.664
What am I supposed... am I supposed
to know where I am right now?

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:37.733
Here.

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:39.200
What is...? What?

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:42.237
- This is your gift.
- I don’t understand.

01:05:51.446 --> 01:05:55.316
I...

01:05:55.317 --> 01:05:58.486
Biron represents a glassblower
who needed the money.

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.555
It was kind of a
last-minute thing.

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:02.089
Michael and I rigged
it up this morning.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:05.460
If you want to change the font
or any part of it, we can...

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.996
It’s... it’s perfect.

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:11.465
Michael... did you talk to Mike?

01:06:11.466 --> 01:06:12.567
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:15.037
He thought it was a great idea.

01:06:16.438 --> 01:06:19.006
- Really great guy.
- Yeah.

01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:21.008
I really like him a lot.

01:06:21.009 --> 01:06:24.812
But enough about him
or anybody else.

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:27.715
Tonight is about you and me,

01:06:27.716 --> 01:06:30.118
so close your eyes.

01:06:31.386 --> 01:06:34.155
I’m nervous.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:36.625
Oh, my God, I can’t
believe you did that.

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.531
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay.

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:46.268
Eyes closed.

01:06:48.203 --> 01:06:51.706
- Okay, you ready?
- Wait, I don’t know.

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:54.710
- Um... okay.
- Open ’em.

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:59.681
Val: Oh, my God.
When did you...?

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:04.152
Michael and I put the
finishing touches on it.

01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:17.632
Ah, a seat for madame?

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:20.401
What?

01:07:20.402 --> 01:07:22.603
Mm, thank you.

01:07:22.604 --> 01:07:24.338
You’re welcome.

01:07:24.339 --> 01:07:25.806
That is the worst...

01:07:25.807 --> 01:07:28.509
That is the worst French
accent I’ve ever heard.

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:32.179
I am sure I don’t know what
you are talking about.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.081
I was born in Paree.

01:07:34.082 --> 01:07:37.652
Oh, je suis désolé, monsieur.

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.587
Huh.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:43.557
How do you say... "show-off"?

01:07:43.558 --> 01:07:45.694
I don’t know.

01:07:46.795 --> 01:07:51.866
Well, I already know
who our waiter is.

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:54.702
Who’s our chef?

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.270
You’re looking at him.

01:07:56.271 --> 01:07:57.571
Oh, yeah?

01:07:57.572 --> 01:07:59.106
I searched high and low

01:07:59.107 --> 01:08:01.342
through all the
finest food stores

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:05.246
in Los Angeles to find this.

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:08.582
Oh, my G... That’s impressive.
That’s the good stuff.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:10.117
I even learned how
to boil water.

01:08:10.118 --> 01:08:12.753
- Oh, my.
- Here goes nothing.

01:08:12.754 --> 01:08:13.888
Okay.

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.990
If you hear screaming...

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:18.260

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:44.452
Mm-hmm.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.356
Brain freeze.

01:08:49.124 --> 01:08:53.395

Not till... not till morning.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.188
I texted Brynn from
the restaurant.

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:25.127
Yeah? God, I love you.

01:09:27.828 --> 01:09:30.032

01:10:25.687 --> 01:10:28.824
Hey.

Oh, my God.

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.695
Babe.

01:10:34.696 --> 01:10:36.897
What’s wrong?

01:10:36.898 --> 01:10:39.333
Hey, talk to me. Talk to me.
Talk to me.

01:10:39.334 --> 01:10:41.636
Hey, you’re scaring me.

01:10:43.338 --> 01:10:46.341
Tom, you’re scaring me.

01:10:55.617 --> 01:10:59.221
Val: Maybe there’s
another specialist.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:03.492
No.

01:11:12.934 --> 01:11:15.302
I just want to tell you to wait.

01:11:15.303 --> 01:11:19.474
Wait. I don’t want you to go.

01:11:50.071 --> 01:11:53.341
Val: Why did you
keep this from me?

01:11:55.343 --> 01:11:57.379
It was a mistake.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.523
How are we gonna tell her?

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:16.198
We’ll figure something out.

01:14:24.492 --> 01:14:29.531
That one looks
like a watermelon.

01:14:30.665 --> 01:14:32.366
Hey, baby girl...

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:35.235
Okay, maybe an egg.

01:14:35.236 --> 01:14:37.237
It’s early, Daddy.

01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:41.008
Hey, do you remember
when Rufus got sick?

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.210
Daddy,

01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:45.513
are you trying to make me cry?

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:49.316
He got sick...

01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:52.186
and we had to drive
him to the vet

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.455
and put him to sleep.

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:57.192
But it wasn’t anyone’s fault.

01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:05.566
Sometimes, things like
that just happen...

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:08.135
no matter how much we
wish that it didn’t.

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:11.405
I know that. Daddy,
what are you...

01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:15.076
Baby, I’m gonna be
your daddy forever.

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:23.250
And if you ever get scared...

01:15:23.251 --> 01:15:27.054
or lonely...

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:31.092
you can look up at these clouds
and you can find me there.

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:35.663
Daddy, I don’t understand.

01:15:41.302 --> 01:15:44.972
It’s okay. You don’t have to.
Not now.

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:47.776
Then why are you crying?

01:15:56.584 --> 01:15:59.154
Because I’m thinking about...

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.329
ice cream.

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:12.734
That’s what I see up there.
Do you see it?

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.639
For breakfast?

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.543
Why the hell not, kiddo?

01:16:22.977 --> 01:16:25.512
Come on. Let’s go
jump in the car

01:16:25.513 --> 01:16:28.450
before Mommy wakes up
and spoils our plan.

01:17:04.919 --> 01:17:08.289
- Wow.
- Tom: Yum!

01:17:10.358 --> 01:17:11.825
Took you long enough.

01:17:11.826 --> 01:17:13.026
Your text said early.

01:17:13.027 --> 01:17:14.528
What kind of ice cream truck

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:16.363
makes its rounds at 7:00 a.m.?

01:17:16.364 --> 01:17:19.066
The kind you pay a
lot of money to.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.267
What’s your flavor?

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.202
Uh, pralines and cream.

01:17:22.203 --> 01:17:24.772
Dumb it down a little.
Ice cream truck.

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:28.041
- Chocolate?
- Good.

01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:30.410
Michael, this is Phoebe.

01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:32.613
Phoebe, this is Michael.

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:33.981
Hey, Pheebs.

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.184
How do you know my nickname?

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:38.752
Because I can read minds.

01:17:38.753 --> 01:17:40.287
No, you can’t.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.588
How do you know that I can’t?

01:17:41.589 --> 01:17:44.058
Your head would be bigger.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:50.264
- Fair enough.
- Tom: Let’s go.

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:52.266
- Mike: You’re eight?
- Yeah.

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.967
Oh, cool.

01:17:53.968 --> 01:17:57.838
- What’s your favorite class?
- I don’t have one.

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.473
- You don’t have a favorite class?
- No.

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:02.476
You know what mine was?
Calculus.

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:05.246
Phoebe: Huh? What’s that?

01:18:50.825 --> 01:18:52.726
Radio DJ: Hey, we’ve been
promising it all week,

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:55.629
and now here it is, kids.
Star 98.7

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.364
has the L.A. premiere of the new

01:18:57.365 --> 01:19:00.934
Hanson Carter single,
"You’ll Always Be My Girl."

01:19:00.935 --> 01:19:02.403
Phoebe!

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:05.773
Phoe...

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.456
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:25.959
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.828
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I’m fine. I’m fine.

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:30.564
I just... I got a little dizzy.
I’m good.

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:33.200
- Do you need a doctor?
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:35.102
No, no.

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:38.339
Last time I went to a doctor,
they told me I was dying.

01:19:40.975 --> 01:19:43.076
That was a joke.

01:19:43.077 --> 01:19:46.347
Heh. Just a joke.

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:58.926
You’re gonna take
care of her, right?

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.996
Right?

01:20:02.997 --> 01:20:04.898
Yeah, Tom.

01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:07.669
Promise me.

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.740
Tom, what are you doing?

01:20:13.741 --> 01:20:17.577
Promise me that no
matter what happens,

01:20:17.578 --> 01:20:20.081
you’re going to
follow through...

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.884
that you’re the guy.

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:26.954
I need to know that
you’re the guy.

01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:32.727
Tom, I don’t know that anybody
can make that promise.

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:38.833
But I will tell you
that I’ll try my best.

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:43.871
Fair enough, Michael.

01:20:48.242 --> 01:20:51.979
Drive her home for me, okay?

01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:56.451
Okay.

01:21:09.597 --> 01:21:11.798
Recording: Hi. It’s Tom Bishop.
I can’t take your call.

01:21:11.799 --> 01:21:15.069
Please leave a message,
and I will call you back.

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:23.844
Where’s Tom?

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:26.546
- We just left him...
- Where, Michael? Where?

01:21:26.547 --> 01:21:29.349
At the park.

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:30.985
Listen. Listen.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.922
Okay, listen.

01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:37.724
Come here. Okay.

01:21:37.725 --> 01:21:39.760
Listen, Uncle Mac is coming
from Aunt Brynn’s house.

01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:41.094
Ooh. Are they going out now?

01:21:41.095 --> 01:21:43.363
Phoebe, focus! Okay, I
want you to go inside.

01:21:43.364 --> 01:21:44.498
I don’t want you to
open up the door

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.700
for anyone else
except Mac, okay?

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:47.968
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you understand?

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:48.969
Mm-hmm.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:50.171
Okay.

01:21:51.472 --> 01:21:53.640
I’m so sorry, Val.
I heard he’s...

01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:55.142
Why were you even together?

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:57.844
- He asked me for help.
- Help with what?

01:21:57.845 --> 01:22:01.348
It’s... it’s complicated.

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.117
Yeah, uncomplicate
it for me, Michael.

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.455
- Does he have his phone?
- Yes, of course he has his phone.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:11.959
All right, let’s go.
Track his phone.

01:23:06.914 --> 01:23:09.684
He told me why he
did it, Val, and...

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:16.723
it makes sense.

01:23:16.724 --> 01:23:19.126
Go home, Michael.

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:37.277
Tom!

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.747
Tom!

01:23:45.419 --> 01:23:48.088
You shouldn’t be here!

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:51.725
You selfish, selfish
son of a bitch!

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:53.093
He told you?

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:56.263
- I am your wife!
- I know! I know.

01:23:56.264 --> 01:24:00.600
All of this has been
for you and Phoebe.

01:24:00.601 --> 01:24:02.068
I am not some puppy

01:24:02.069 --> 01:24:04.037
you could just give
away to someone

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:06.139
when you think they
need a better home!

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.008
- I am your wife!
- I know! I know!

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:10.810
I’m trying to do what
is best for you.

01:24:10.811 --> 01:24:13.580
Look. Take a close look,

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:14.881
because this is
just the beginning.

01:24:14.882 --> 01:24:17.150
Val, this is just the beginning.

01:24:17.151 --> 01:24:19.019
It’s gonna get so much worse.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.154
I don’t want you to
see me like that.

01:24:21.155 --> 01:24:24.926
You don’t get to tell
us what we want!

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:28.194
What was this, the...
the lone martyr

01:24:28.195 --> 01:24:31.332
walks out into the ocean to die?
You kidding me?

01:24:32.433 --> 01:24:35.468
You want to choose how you die?

01:24:35.469 --> 01:24:37.771
Here’s your choice.

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:41.041
You come home, and you
stay with me and Phoebe

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:43.744
and your friends
and your family...

01:24:45.012 --> 01:24:47.748
and the people who love you...

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:52.853
remembering the amazing
life that we have.

01:24:54.822 --> 01:24:57.358
Or you can die right here.

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:02.396
I’m not gonna sit here and
watch you kill yourself.

01:25:09.136 --> 01:25:11.138
Val!

01:25:16.844 --> 01:25:19.046
I don’t know what to do.

01:25:22.616 --> 01:25:25.186
I don’t know what to do.

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.292
Shh. Shh.

01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:44.105
I’m sorry.

01:25:45.239 --> 01:25:48.042
I’m so sorry.

01:25:58.519 --> 01:26:00.187
How did we get here?

01:26:01.889 --> 01:26:05.326
You’re a control freak.

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:08.095
Right.

01:26:11.532 --> 01:26:14.868
And you’re lucky Michael’s
good with words.

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:17.837
If he hadn’t explained
everything so well,

01:26:17.838 --> 01:26:20.140
I would have killed you myself.

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.808
He’s good with words, is he?

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.476
He’s excellent with words.

01:26:23.477 --> 01:26:24.878
- Huh.
- He’s excellent.

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:26.179
And model handsome.

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.148
I mean, you have really
good taste in men.

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:29.783
You could set me up anytime.

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:33.054
Okay, okay. Enough.

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:37.925
Don’t ever try anything
stupid like that again.

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:47.568
You still love me?

01:26:50.304 --> 01:26:54.041
Loving you was
never the problem.

01:26:55.342 --> 01:26:57.378
I like you.

01:26:58.612 --> 01:27:01.182
I like you very much.

01:27:02.883 --> 01:27:05.352
I like you, too.

01:27:29.977 --> 01:27:31.377
You can’t let go.

01:27:31.378 --> 01:27:34.581
Do I look like somebody
who would let go of you?

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.149
Michael!

01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:38.651
- Oh!
- Mac: That is hurtful.

01:27:38.652 --> 01:27:40.820
That’s a hurt... that’s
a hurtful thing to do.

01:27:40.821 --> 01:27:43.189
- Sorry.
- Doesn’t trust me.

01:27:43.190 --> 01:27:44.657
It takes a while. It’s okay.

01:27:44.658 --> 01:27:46.893
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:49.929
Don’t push her if
she’s not ready.

01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:51.865
She’s ready.

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:54.534
You’re ready, right?

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:55.702
Uh-uh.

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:59.038
Michael: Two... three...

01:27:59.039 --> 01:28:01.341
- Here we go.
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:03.376
- Don’t let go! Don’t let go!
- Come on, you got it.

01:28:03.377 --> 01:28:05.412
No, don’t... okay, okay, okay!

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:10.784
Whoo, Phoebe!

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.520
Val: Oh, my God!

01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:32.606
Daddy, I’m doing it!
I’m doing it!
