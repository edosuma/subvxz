I'm sorry you had
to see this, man,

16:56.276 --> 16:58.452
but I think there's something
you should know.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.149
Carl is cheatin'.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.064
That's right, money.
You caught.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.067
And you not gonna treat my moms
like a side chick!

17:05.067 --> 17:07.374
That ain't going down
like that, B.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.854
She ain't no side chick, man!A side chick?

17:09.854 --> 17:11.726
Yeah, that's right!

17:11.726 --> 17:14.555
Run around the streets, man,
with this young lodi dodi, man.

17:14.555 --> 17:15.904
Look at her.
Girl, what you, about what?

17:15.904 --> 17:17.079
22? 23?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.211
She's 26.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.995
26.
Exactly!

17:19.995 --> 17:21.562
Pretending to be
Captain Save-A-Ho.

17:21.562 --> 17:22.824
She is what?!

17:22.824 --> 17:24.695
26, Ma?
How you know?

17:24.695 --> 17:26.349
She's his daughter.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.528
You his...?
His daughter?!

17:31.528 --> 17:32.660
Mm-hmm-hmm.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.792
Wow, he make pretty babies,
huh?

17:34.792 --> 17:36.577
I did not know that.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.100
Roberta.
What?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.495
If this boy was my son,
I'd put on my wrestling tights

17:41.495 --> 17:43.714
and I'd grab both legs,
then I'd pile-drive him!

17:43.714 --> 17:45.455
Boom!

17:45.455 --> 17:47.892
Go on top of the top rope,
do like this.

17:47.892 --> 17:48.937
Like this.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.678
Crowd goin' crazy.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.027
Then I'd Superfly Snuka.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.246
Quiet, please.Aaah!

17:53.246 --> 17:54.595
Boom!
Right on top of him!

17:54.595 --> 17:56.118
Carl.The referee come out.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.685
Tap, tap, tap!
It's over!

17:57.685 --> 17:59.121
Daddy's the champ!

17:59.121 --> 18:00.557
Okay, I-I'm gonna have to ask
all of you to leave.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.255
Security!Wait, what are you doing?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.821
Hey, don't you do that!

18:03.821 --> 18:05.345
[ All shouting at once ]

18:05.345 --> 18:06.694
No, no, no, no, no!

18:06.694 --> 18:08.652
-We're leaving!
-Don't tell him!

18:08.652 --> 18:10.263
Hey, hey, hey!

18:10.263 --> 18:12.134
Let's go, baby.Alright, alright.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.396
So embarrassed.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.919
If that ain't argument
profiling,

18:14.919 --> 18:16.486
I don't know what it is.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.925
Mom.
Sorry.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.276
Sorry, Carl.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.755
I'm sorry, Carl's daughter.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.279
My name is Carla.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.933
Carla, I'm just trying
to protect my moms.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.761
Hey, Tray, we all get it.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.676
I understand, man.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.025
I can't say I would've done
the same dumb shit,

18:34.025 --> 18:35.636
but I get it.Listen, you stay away from me.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.507
Oh, come on, Tray!
Stop!

18:37.507 --> 18:39.509
Dad, why don't we give them
a little time alone?

18:39.509 --> 18:42.164
Baby girl, you are
absolutely right.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.601
Roberta,
I'll be at home,

18:44.601 --> 18:47.343
where the fork will be
waiting for the spoon.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.953
[ Chuckles ] Let's go.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.391
Come on.
Get out of here.

18:53.393 --> 18:57.658
Tray, you have to let me
live my life.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.530
I held my breath for 15 years
until you got out.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.184
Now you gotta
let me breathe.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.098
Man, I just don't want him
to hurt you.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.753
Yeah, but now you
hurting me!

19:05.753 --> 19:09.104
You got to give Carl
a chance, baby.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.627
I'll try.

19:10.627 --> 19:11.759
Thank you.

19:11.759 --> 19:12.803
I love you so much.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.892
I love you too, Mommy.

19:14.892 --> 19:15.980
I love you, too.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.243
But I gotta say.What?

19:17.243 --> 19:18.983
I think you stole
those panties.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.246
Oh, no, I --

19:20.246 --> 19:22.378
We better go.[ Both laugh ]

19:26.208 --> 19:28.167
Ohh!

19:28.167 --> 19:31.474
Yeah.That is beautiful, Carl!

19:31.474 --> 19:33.259
Just beautiful!

19:33.259 --> 19:35.261
You know what's beautiful?
You beautiful, Berta.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.218
Oh, stop.Come on, now, you beautiful.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.089
You beautiful.Stop that.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.743
I was painting that picture,
I got jealous of myself.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.484
I said, "Who that man with his
hands on my woman?"

19:41.484 --> 19:43.834
[ Laughs ] Stop it!"Get your hands off Berta!"

19:43.834 --> 19:44.618
[ Laughs ]

19:44.618 --> 19:46.272
Hey, hey.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.273
Hey, Tray, don't feel
left out, man.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.796
I got something for you, too.Oh?

19:48.796 --> 19:50.058
What you got for me, man?Ooh.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.408

Mm-hmm.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.284
Here it come!

19:58.284 --> 20:01.591
Huh?
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

20:01.591 --> 20:03.071
Ooh, word!

20:03.071 --> 20:05.029

20:05.029 --> 20:07.989
Mm.
