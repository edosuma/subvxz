00:00.010 --> 00:02.070
So, how old could it be?

00:02.120 --> 00:03.990
10, 20 years? Maybe longer.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.070
Male, do you think?

00:05.120 --> 00:07.590
That looks like a bloke's watch.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.270
- Daddies!
- Hello, my darling.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.880
You're gonna be fine. And in ten
weeks, she'll be ours for good.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.350
I saw you yesterday, in the supermarket...

00:16.400 --> 00:17.670
How much?

00:17.720 --> 00:19.240
£5,000.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.510
- Are you nervous?
- No, terrified.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.910
Who wouldn't want to turn
a school like that around?

00:23.960 --> 00:26.910
You will never find a candidate
who understands the sorts of kids

00:26.960 --> 00:28.910
you have at Highbrook better than me.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.590
I've gotta go but I'll see
you on the ward. Bye, love.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.190
- Who was that?
- Zoe, the girl with non-Hodgkins.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.790
She's got your personal number?

00:35.840 --> 00:38.630
When I was examining the body,
I noticed something a bit odd.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.910
It's the remains of a pager.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.310
We'd need to source a working
version of this model,

00:42.360 --> 00:44.990
de-solder the data chip from
this and see what we get.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.430
Here he is.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.520
David Ewan Walker.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.680
63% of all murder victims are
killed by their partners.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.360
You'll be thinking that, won't you?

So, yesterday we believe we
identified the body in the case,

01:48.040 --> 01:50.280
as David Ewan Walker,

01:50.360 --> 01:54.640
reported missing on the 10th of May, 1990.

01:54.720 --> 01:59.120
The postmortem confirmed
that David Walker died

01:59.200 --> 02:02.720
as a result of probably a
single stab wound to the chest.

02:04.040 --> 02:09.759
So, we're looking for his
killer, pure and simple.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.720
For whoever robbed a five-year-old child

02:12.800 --> 02:16.520
of the opportunity to
ever see his dad again.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.880
A boy who... well, no,
he's a 31-year-old man now,

02:20.960 --> 02:25.080
who has apparently spent the last 26 years

02:25.160 --> 02:28.200
praying that his father
would still turn up...

02:28.280 --> 02:30.350
- Hey, Mum.
- .. alive.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.320
What?

02:36.080 --> 02:39.070
So, the data chip from the
pager we found on his body

02:39.120 --> 02:40.430
is still being analysed.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.590
But so far we've pulled information off it

02:42.640 --> 02:46.360
going back about erm...
12 weeks before he died.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.070
Now, I'm not sure how much you
children know about pagers.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.990
But this one was alphanumeric,

02:53.040 --> 02:55.350
which meant as well as
leaving your phone number,

02:55.400 --> 02:57.510
you could send it short
messages, like a text.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.470
Now, obviously the more we can decipher,

02:59.520 --> 03:01.670
er... the more of an insight we can gain

03:01.720 --> 03:04.270
into his movements in the
last few weeks of his life.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.440
So, Fran, can you talk to
BT and see if they can help

03:08.520 --> 03:11.190
fill in the gaps of any
of these phone numbers.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.520
And a bottle of erm... champagne...

03:14.600 --> 03:17.070
- Whoo!
- Prosecco. Budget cuts.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.600
.. to whoever can decode this message.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.070
Myself and DI Khan

03:22.120 --> 03:25.800
will learn everything we can about
David Walker from his widow.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.520
And, Murray, and erm... Jake,

03:28.600 --> 03:31.230
can you to dig out the original files.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.390
Let's see what that
investigation turned up.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.510
OK, thank you, everyone.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.780
I was erm... I was thinking last night.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.830
Why would you leave anything on a body

03:42.880 --> 03:46.840
that could possibly identify the
victim and then, possibly, you.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.590
Because you rushed
things, you didn't check?

03:51.640 --> 03:54.680
And why would you do that? Why
would you effectively panic?

03:56.640 --> 04:00.080
Cos you were in shock.
Never killed anyone before.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.400
It's worth bearing in mind.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.040
- Hey, boys. - Hi. - Hi.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.160
.. horsepower. That's not...

04:22.440 --> 04:26.880
- Hiya. - Hi, love.
Oh, this came for you.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.740
By bike.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.110
I got a second interview.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.040
Oh... get in!

04:50.120 --> 04:53.200
- Well done.
- Oh, man, get a room.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.420
Oh.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.790
I've got those charts.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.350
- Can you let me know when
Dr Samuels is in. - Yeah.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.670
- Ooh, Marion.
- Hey.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.310
- Have you got a minute?
- Yeah.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.470
She said that she was finding
it hard to speak to her parents

05:16.520 --> 05:18.590
and that she loved our
chats and that she...

05:18.640 --> 05:19.790
She just asked if I'd mind

05:19.840 --> 05:21.870
if she could phone my mobile occasionally.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.510
Right. And when was this?

05:23.560 --> 05:25.550
Oh, gosh, about a month ago.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.880
- And how many times has she
called you on your mobile? - Twice.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.310
Er... yesterday and then...

05:30.360 --> 05:32.870
about day or so after she
first asked me, I think.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.040
- It's not like a regular thing, really.
- No. No, no, not at all.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.630
And I would've put a stop to it

05:37.680 --> 05:39.510
if I thought it was getting out of hand.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.950
I mean, it's obviously great

05:41.000 --> 05:43.510
that you've developed such
a strong rapport with her

05:43.560 --> 05:45.350
and I know how much you've helped her.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.150
I just think we need to reset
the boundaries a bit now

05:48.200 --> 05:51.440
- and just say no more personal calls.
- OK, yeah, sure.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.710
I'll speak to her parents
and reassure them,

05:53.760 --> 05:55.670
they just felt a little bit undermined.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.110
OK, no problem. And I'm sorry if...

05:58.160 --> 06:00.360
OK. Thanks, Marion. Cheers.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.640
Sorry, who... who told them?
Zoe's parents, I mean?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.880
Zoe, I presume. Who else?

06:28.840 --> 06:31.150
All my life, I've thought
he walked out on us.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.480
I know. But I always said we
didn't know that for sure.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.630
It was the best-case scenario, Mum.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.080
Worst-case? He topped himself.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.200
His five-year-old kid wasn't
enough to stay alive for.

06:44.280 --> 06:49.120
I mean, can you imagine what 26
years of thinking that does to you?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.520
No, I can't.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.200
And then to find out it was this?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.590
That he did nothing wrong.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.920
That he did still love us.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.600
I feel... cheated. I
feel... I feel robbed.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.520
I know. Me, too.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.320
I'm so sorry, mate, for you both.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.560
Who would've wanted to
have done that to him?

07:20.080 --> 07:22.950
Who would have wanted to have hurt my dad?

07:37.920 --> 07:39.800
Don't nudge my arm.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.320
All right, you finish it
off. Give me one second.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.080
What is it, Col? What's the matter?

07:54.160 --> 07:55.720
Nothing.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.790
These are meant to be the
happiest weeks of our lives.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.110
I'm fine.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.500
Everything's absolutely fine.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.900
We went out for about
five years, on and off.

08:11.780 --> 08:15.140
Er... finally got married
in '81, had Jason in '85.

08:15.220 --> 08:18.860
Hm. And it was a happy marriage?

08:18.940 --> 08:22.060
Yeah. Well, it was as happy as any.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.810
How do you mean?

08:23.860 --> 08:26.700
Well, no marriage is perfect, is it?

08:26.780 --> 08:28.740
No. No, I guess not.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.940
No, I mean, we... we loved
each other but er...

08:33.020 --> 08:37.820
David had his issues, periods
of fairly serious depression.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.640
And... and that put a strain on things.

08:40.900 --> 08:45.090
And this depression was
caused by one thing, or...

08:45.140 --> 08:47.930
Well, no, I think that's the
point of depression, isn't it?

08:47.980 --> 08:50.130
There isn't anything
obvious to be sad about.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.970
- Sure. - I mean, certainly,
I never really worked it out.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.140
In the end, I think it was... I
think it was just how he was made.

08:56.220 --> 08:59.660
And... and you said all this
to the original investigation?

08:59.740 --> 09:03.140
Yeah, I think I did, I mean...
God, it was a long time ago now.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.680
Indeed.

09:07.380 --> 09:14.220
We found the remains of a
pager on your husband's body?

09:14.300 --> 09:16.170
Yeah. Yeah, he had a pager.

09:16.220 --> 09:20.740
Do any of these numbers or
messages ring any bells for you.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.340
Right, well, if that's...
if that's "call me",

09:27.420 --> 09:29.450
that's the sort of message I often sent.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.980
- I probably even sent something
like that when he went missing. - Hm.

09:33.060 --> 09:35.770
Nothing else rings any bells on that list?

09:35.820 --> 09:38.980
Mm... no. No, sorry.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.810
Can I just ask, did you both work?

10:14.860 --> 10:17.170
He did. I stayed at home
after Jason was born.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.890
- What was his job?
- He worked in the leisure industry.

10:19.940 --> 10:22.450
- Clubs and nightclubs.
- And was that successful?

10:22.500 --> 10:25.330
Yeah, I mean David worked incredibly hard.

10:25.380 --> 10:28.330
He was one of those guys who was
always on the right charity board.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.570
Did loads of voluntary stuff,
raised funds for the local Tories...

10:31.620 --> 10:33.730
What I'm saying is, he was well-connected.

10:33.780 --> 10:37.420
He went missing on the 8th but you
didn't report it till the 10th?

10:37.500 --> 10:39.980
- No.
- Why was that?

10:40.060 --> 10:42.610
He sometimes went away
on work-related stuff

10:42.660 --> 10:46.300
and would neglect to tell
me, but never two nights.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.450
When he didn't come
home that second evening,

10:48.500 --> 10:49.890
I rang the police first thing.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.650
- I assume you tried to call him.
- Many times, at work.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.740
And those calls were logged
by the original investigation.

10:55.820 --> 10:56.970
And they said what?

10:57.020 --> 10:59.610
His office said he hadn't come in that day

10:59.660 --> 11:03.060
and that no-one had seen him
since early evening of the 8th.

11:03.140 --> 11:06.500
- And where was that?
- At a pub in Cannon Street.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.610
- Erm... with anyone, or...?
- Two Tory party members.

11:10.660 --> 11:14.580
He left at 7:00, saying he was
off to meet a potential donor.

11:14.660 --> 11:18.500
And erm... well, that was
the last time he was seen.

11:18.580 --> 11:21.170
In the weeks and months
afterwards, what did you think?

11:21.220 --> 11:23.130
Well, for a long time, I...

11:23.180 --> 11:25.410
I thought he'd finally
had a full on breakdown

11:25.460 --> 11:29.780
and just disappeared to some backwater.

11:29.860 --> 11:32.060
He was that troubled?

11:32.140 --> 11:34.370
In the absence of any better explanation,

11:34.420 --> 11:36.760
it was the best answer I had.

11:37.100 --> 11:40.100
And as the months and
then years went by...

11:42.220 --> 11:45.300
.. I just assumed he'd gone off
and killed himself somewhere.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.850
I presume the business came to you?

11:49.900 --> 11:52.100
It did, yeah, eventually.

11:52.180 --> 11:57.340
And er... for all his ambition
and endless years of 14-hour days,

11:57.420 --> 11:59.370
it wasn't actually worth much.

11:59.420 --> 12:03.220
All I know is Jason and I ended
up with less than £30,000.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.540
So I joined the police force
six months after he disappeared,

12:06.620 --> 12:09.530
mainly cos I was so impressed
with the officers on his case,

12:09.580 --> 12:11.890
but also, because I needed the money.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.100
Hm.

12:14.340 --> 12:15.940
OK, thank you.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.410
Fasting gives us criteria,
it gives us guidance

12:26.460 --> 12:29.060
on what is right and what is wrong.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.290
- Sister... - As long as
people keep taking it down,

12:37.340 --> 12:39.090
I will keep sticking it back up, Omar.

12:39.140 --> 12:40.730
I've had so many complaints, Sara.

12:40.780 --> 12:44.180
And so have I, from other women
made to pray in that room.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.620
It's tiny, it smells.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.050
We have limited space...

12:48.100 --> 12:49.610
Fine, we swap, then.

12:49.660 --> 12:52.490
We have your room, you have ours, simple.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.010
Bye, Omar.

13:06.580 --> 13:07.930
Evening, all.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.890
Hello, love. Good day?

13:09.940 --> 13:11.410
Yeah, not bad. You?

13:11.460 --> 13:13.250
I just put down the phone on Adam.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.500
He might come down next weekend
to celebrate my birthday.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.850
Oh, that'd be nice.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.330
Did he tell you about his
girlfriend? What she did?

13:20.380 --> 13:23.050
Yeah. He seemed to think
it was a selling point.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.690
What do you mean, "selling point"?

13:24.740 --> 13:27.130
- The term "threes up"
was used... - Oh...

13:27.180 --> 13:30.170
At which point, I reminded him
I've got an irregular heartbeat.

13:30.220 --> 13:31.690
Youth of today.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.410
Lucky bastards.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.970
Oh, I meant to ask you,

13:36.020 --> 13:39.100
- what were you doing in Winchester
last Wednesday? - Winchester?

13:39.180 --> 13:41.210
I found a train ticket
in your jeans pocket,

13:41.260 --> 13:43.010
I was about to put them in the machine.

13:43.060 --> 13:44.810
Well, it must have been something

13:44.860 --> 13:47.960
I must have picked up
accidentally in the pub.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.410
Huh.

13:49.460 --> 13:55.620
Last Wednesday? I was playing
pitch-and-putt with Bob and Gem

13:55.700 --> 13:57.100
in Acton.

13:58.140 --> 14:00.210
Right. Yeah, no worries.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.620
Of course I didn't tell them. How
would I even know their number?

14:16.700 --> 14:19.900
She rang me from her landline, you
could have looked on my mobile.

14:19.980 --> 14:24.180
- Well, why would I do that?
- I don't know, Tony, you tell me.

14:24.940 --> 14:26.970
I'm... I'm worried about you.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.970
I'm worried you're getting sick again.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.690
I'm not getting sick again, Tony.

14:30.740 --> 14:32.130
Just cos I don't see the world

14:32.180 --> 14:34.450
exactly how you see it, how Elise sees it.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.890
What's Elise got to do with it?

14:35.940 --> 14:38.970
Oh, every time I disagree with
either of you, I'm going nuts again.

14:39.020 --> 14:41.730
And I saw you, by the way,
exchanging looks about me at mum's.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.810
I didn't exchange any looks with her.

14:43.860 --> 14:46.690
You have no idea what it's
like being part of that family.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.250
I didn't ring Zoe's parents, sweetheart.

14:49.300 --> 14:53.060
I promise, I would never
do something like that.

14:53.140 --> 14:56.180
Marion. Marion, don't...

14:58.900 --> 15:01.050
So, yesterday we spoke to Tessa Nixon

15:01.100 --> 15:04.860
or erm... DI Tessa Nixon I should say.

15:04.940 --> 15:07.410
And we both felt that she
was holding stuff back,

15:07.460 --> 15:11.700
but no evidence as yet that she had
anything to do with his murder.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.780
Murray, what did the original
investigation conclude?

15:14.860 --> 15:18.180
Exactly that. There was no evidence
connecting her to any foul play.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.890
- How comprehensive were the files?
- Pretty good.

15:20.940 --> 15:23.850
Though we both thought their
angle was definitely more misper

15:23.900 --> 15:26.050
than foul play, so...
There are holes, though.

15:26.100 --> 15:29.220
- Things dealt with not quite
rigorously enough. - Such as?

15:29.380 --> 15:32.050
This travelcard was found
in an office desk of his

15:32.100 --> 15:34.730
- in the days after his
disappearance. - OK.

15:34.780 --> 15:37.980
Look at the dates -- 7th of May, 1990.

15:38.060 --> 15:39.530
The day before he disappeared.

15:39.580 --> 15:42.490
Erm... are we... are we sure
that this is his handwriting?

15:42.540 --> 15:45.010
The experts back in the day
thought it probably was.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.490
And this was followed up?

15:46.540 --> 15:48.850
Yeah, it was. 26 Raglan Way, Highgate.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.730
Two sisters lived in
there, both in their 70s,

15:51.780 --> 15:54.450
who had no idea why their
address was on this ticket.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.450
Got a number for the address, called it,

15:56.500 --> 15:58.570
- but they both died
several years ago. - Oh.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.900
But I'm just wondering,
is that definitely a six?

16:01.980 --> 16:03.980
Or could it be a zero?

16:07.620 --> 16:10.090
I told you we shouldn't sack him.

16:10.540 --> 16:13.620
So, have... have you made
contact with number 20?

16:13.700 --> 16:16.690
Yeah, local authority records
have a Mrs J Dunphy living there

16:16.740 --> 16:18.050
who's an 80-year-old widow.

16:18.100 --> 16:22.780
Very... good... work. We
need to follow up on that.

16:22.850 --> 16:23.850
Anything else?

16:23.900 --> 16:27.260
These are photocopies of the last
three months of his desk diary,

16:27.340 --> 16:30.210
and this is a list of all the
original points of action

16:30.260 --> 16:31.410
that came out of it.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.050
I went through, highlighted any gaps.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.810
And this one seems to have
slipped through the cracks.

16:36.860 --> 16:40.260
There's the time, 7:30,
on the 9th of March,

16:40.340 --> 16:43.100
and then next to it, a name -- Colin.

16:43.180 --> 16:46.620
Then, 5 days later, the
14th, a phone number,

16:46.700 --> 16:51.100
which BT have said at the time
was registered to a C Osbourne.

16:51.180 --> 16:54.170
- C for Colin.
- And this wasn't followed up?

16:54.220 --> 16:56.930
Officers called on the address
attached several times.

16:56.980 --> 17:00.860
It was a flat near Tower Bridge
-- Flat Seven, Ferriers' Wharf.

17:00.940 --> 17:03.650
No-one was ever in and then
it was never followed up.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.810
But seeing as it was only a few
weeks before he was murdered,

17:06.859 --> 17:08.849
we think it's worth chasing down, right?

17:08.900 --> 17:11.940
Yeah, definitely. Thanks, Jake.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.780
- Fran.
- Yeah.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.690
So, BT have been very helpful,

17:15.740 --> 17:17.490
lots of numbers come up more than once.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.290
So, most of these are his work numbers.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.210
His clubs, his accountant, his office.

17:21.260 --> 17:25.900
But this one here is his best mate,
James Gregory, a restaurant owner.

17:25.980 --> 17:28.089
He's still on the same number, erm...

17:28.140 --> 17:30.450
I spoke to him, he seemed
really keen to talk to us.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.370
That's interesting.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.420
OK and erm... finally,

17:35.500 --> 17:40.260
anyone claiming a bottle of
the very finest £5 Prosecco?

17:40.340 --> 17:42.820
Yes. I think it's an address.

17:47.580 --> 17:54.300
Er... Flat C, Shawbrook Mansions...

17:54.380 --> 17:56.780
And the KX?

17:58.300 --> 17:59.900
King's Cross.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.410
Oh, very well done.

18:03.860 --> 18:05.980
Fran, very good.

18:06.060 --> 18:10.540
OK, now we will follow up on all
of that. Thank you, everyone.

18:14.740 --> 18:17.610
Flat Seven, Ferriers' Wharf, Tower Bridge.

18:21.980 --> 18:26.540
Yes, August '88 to May 1990,

18:26.620 --> 18:29.580
it was let to a Colin Eliot Osborne.

18:29.660 --> 18:33.100
- OK, any forwarding address?
- No.

18:34.340 --> 18:37.660
Right. No references
or previous addresses?

18:37.740 --> 18:41.540
- Sorry, after seven years, we
just keep the contracts. - Right.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.020
Wow, £24,000 per annum,

18:44.100 --> 18:46.290
that's... well, that's two grand a month.

18:46.340 --> 18:48.450
That was serious money
back then, wasn't it?

18:48.500 --> 18:52.660
- It was the '80s. It's when
serious money was invented. - Yeah.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.940
Fran, I'm in King's Cross,
outside your Shawbrook Mansions.

18:57.020 --> 19:00.060
I can see it was residential,
it's now an advertising agency.

19:01.220 --> 19:06.330
Er... maybe check Land
Registry records for 1990,

19:06.380 --> 19:07.690
see who owned the building.

19:07.740 --> 19:11.060
- Check utility bills, gas, electric,
water... - Yeah. - Yeah, OK.

19:21.140 --> 19:23.860
- Hey.
- So, a zero or a six?

19:23.940 --> 19:25.850
Dunno yet, there's no-one in.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.210
I've dropped a note through
the door to call us.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.330
So, I've just spoken to the original owner

19:30.380 --> 19:31.890
of the King's Cross property.

19:31.940 --> 19:34.090
- He'd be happy to speak
to us in an hour. - Huh.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.010
Fran found a gas bill with the
tenant's name -- an S Larvey.

19:37.060 --> 19:38.570
Also, just spoke to Jake.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.740
He thinks he might have tracked
down your Tower Bridge tenant.

19:41.820 --> 19:44.930
A Colin Eliot Osborne who's the right age,

19:44.980 --> 19:47.210
living in Brighton, working as a lawyer.

19:47.260 --> 19:48.530
Great.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.610
- I'm gonna give you the money.
- All right.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.650
But it's a one-off payment.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.290
If you come after me again,

19:57.340 --> 20:00.050
I will go to the police
and social services myself

20:00.100 --> 20:02.240
and I'll take my chances.

20:02.980 --> 20:04.730
I need to know you understand that.

20:04.780 --> 20:08.260
Absolutely. You know, I'm not
some lowlife blackmailer, Colin.

20:08.340 --> 20:11.140
This is a one-off for both our benefit.

20:12.340 --> 20:15.540
Meet me in the cafe we were in
before at 9:30 on Wednesday.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.580
Ms Alazi.

20:28.660 --> 20:32.300
I'm sorry, no, I have no
recollection of her at all.

20:32.380 --> 20:36.660
I mean, obviously she was a
tenant cos she paid the gas bill.

20:36.740 --> 20:39.300
But I owned eight houses,

20:39.380 --> 20:42.170
each of which had up
to five flats, you know,

20:42.220 --> 20:44.570
which I rented out from the late '60s

20:44.620 --> 20:47.570
to when I sold up in
er... what was it? 2007?

20:47.620 --> 20:50.050
Yeah, I must have had
thousands of tenants.

20:50.100 --> 20:51.490
Right, I see.

20:51.540 --> 20:54.820
Took over the supply in late '89.

20:56.060 --> 21:00.100
Well, er... as I'm sure
you're both well-aware,

21:00.180 --> 21:03.420
King's Cross has changed a
fair bit in the past few years.

21:03.500 --> 21:08.100
- Yes. - But in '89, the house
she lived in at that time

21:08.180 --> 21:12.420
I rented out almost
exclusively to prostitutes.

21:13.580 --> 21:16.340
Yeah, lovely girls most of 'em.

21:16.420 --> 21:19.900
Yeah, very reliable. Always paid on time.

21:19.980 --> 21:26.020
So I'd be very surprised if
your Ms Alazi wasn't a tart.

21:31.720 --> 21:35.440
Any form relating to S
Alazi, King's Cross area,

21:35.520 --> 21:38.440
from... let's say '88 to '92.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.750
Cheers, Jake.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.000
Guv.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.430
I'm trying to think of other
reasons why a man would have

21:46.480 --> 21:49.470
a prostitute's address sent to
his pager, but I am struggling.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.510
Which would be exactly the same
conversation a wife would have

21:52.560 --> 21:54.510
with her husband if she found out.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.900
Indeed.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.840
We can use this one.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.630
I'm sorry, we're very aware
of how hard this must be

22:30.680 --> 22:32.680
for you to hear.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.480
And he messaged her, or...?

22:37.600 --> 22:40.140
We think she sent him her address.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.940
Which we have good reason to
believe she used for business.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.790
No, I had no knowledge of him

22:49.840 --> 22:52.840
using prostitutes,
obviously, I was his wife.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.870
And, no, we didn't row about it,

22:55.920 --> 22:57.390
the row didn't get out of hand

22:57.440 --> 23:00.440
and I didn't accidentally
fucking kill him.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.430
Sure.

23:02.480 --> 23:08.320
But, knowing him as you did and
not withstanding his issues...

23:09.600 --> 23:12.960
.. is it something now you could
contemplate he could have done?

23:13.040 --> 23:15.640
Could he have been that sort of man?

23:18.400 --> 23:21.400
How long have you been a
detective, DCI Stuart?

23:21.480 --> 23:23.120
22 years.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.480
19.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.440
Would anything a man is
capable of surprise you?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.000
OK.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.590
Thanks for your time, Tessa.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.110
Thank you.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.180
- Thank you.
- Bye.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.390
- Tess.
- Ma'am.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.710
Have you got five?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.920
Er... yeah, sure.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.510
"Restricted duties"?

24:00.560 --> 24:02.510
Look, I understand this must be hard to...

24:02.560 --> 24:06.030
I was cleared of any involvement in my
husband's disappearance 26 years ago.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.950
Of course, and that's not what this is.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.750
- DCI Stuart is just doing
a general sweep... - Tess.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.070
No-one can be expected
to do their job properly

24:13.120 --> 24:14.510
with this hanging over them.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.510
Except nothing is hanging over me, ma'am.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.760
Not to mention the upset of
learning what happened to David.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.030
So, I wanna set up some
counselling for you.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.080
I'm gonna refer you to
Occupational Health.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.360
Are you telling me I have to go on
restricted duties or asking me to?

24:29.440 --> 24:32.350
I'm saying be sensible,
take a back seat for a bit

24:32.400 --> 24:36.000
and I'm sure it'll all have
blown over in a few weeks.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.720
Do you think I might have done it, then?

24:40.080 --> 24:42.110
Tess, that is insulting
and I can't even...

24:42.160 --> 24:44.630
No, I'm fine, ma'am. If you
want me out of my office,

24:44.680 --> 24:48.180
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to formally suspend me.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.990
I don't care what time anyone
else is staying till, Aisha,

24:54.040 --> 24:55.550
I want you back at 11:00.

24:55.600 --> 25:00.680
Listen. Lis... Listen.
Listen. OK, here's the deal.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.550
You can either go and be back
by 11:00, or not go at all.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.400
It's your choice.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.750
Aisha?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.190
Ai...

25:09.240 --> 25:10.380
Oh!

25:12.320 --> 25:14.350
Hardball. Respect.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.880
I've been having the same conversation
every week for the last six months.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.700
It's like negotiating with a goldfish.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Mr Osborne?

25:53.520 --> 25:54.870
Er... excuse me. Hello.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.840
DCI Stuart. DI Khan. Bishop Street Police.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.550
Is there somewhere we could
go for a quick chat, please?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.230
I was just about to go in to court.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.790
If it's about a case, you
should contact my chambers

26:04.840 --> 26:07.470
- and they'll...
- No, it's not about a case of yours.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.070
We're investigating an
historical case in London

26:10.120 --> 26:14.120
and we hoped you might be able
to help us with our enquiries.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.350
All right, take room
three down the corridor.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.630
I was just about to got to the loo, so...

26:18.680 --> 26:20.150
Thank you.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.360
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.460
Sorry, no... no idea.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.950
And the name doesn't ring any bells?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.280
Erm... no. No, sorry.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.280
OK, not a problem.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.920
The only reason we ask is
that we found a phone number

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
that was registered to a
flat that you were renting

27:21.080 --> 27:24.040
in a desk diary belonging to David Walker.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.280
Wh... which flat?

27:26.360 --> 27:29.240
Er... Ferriers' Wharf, Tower Bridge.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.750
- Oh, OK.
- You did rent that flat?

27:32.800 --> 27:36.080
Er... yes. Late '80s, I think.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.160
'88 to '90.

27:38.960 --> 27:44.160
Erm... I mean, I had a lot of
mates staying with me at that flat,

27:44.240 --> 27:47.230
I suppose any one of them could
have given this guy the number.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.150
It was slightly party central.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.750
It was a pretty cool flat.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.190
Well, I was working in the
city at the time, so...

27:53.240 --> 27:54.630
As a lawyer?

27:54.680 --> 27:56.550
No, a banker, I'm afraid.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.680
Oh, right, Erm... which bank?

28:00.760 --> 28:02.360
Klein Egerton?

28:04.240 --> 28:07.240
Banker to criminal lawyer, that's...

28:08.760 --> 28:10.590
.. that's quite a change, isn't it?

28:10.640 --> 28:11.960
Is it?

28:12.040 --> 28:13.910
What prompted that?

28:14.480 --> 28:16.430
If you'd worked in the city in the '80s,

28:16.480 --> 28:17.990
you wouldn't have to ask me this.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.780
Pretty soulless.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.830
Well, good for you.

28:21.880 --> 28:25.960
I looked at your chambers website,
you do a lot of really good work.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.240
- I hope so. - Lots of pro bono. - Yeah.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.990
You obviously have a desire to...

28:33.800 --> 28:35.870
.. give something back.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.110
Well, if you can, I think you should.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.900
Hm.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.080
Yeah.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.500
Well, thanks for your time...

28:46.760 --> 28:50.840
.. Mr Osborne, we appreciate it.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.150
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.400
Oh, actually, no, one... one more thing.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.670
When did you say you left banking?

28:58.720 --> 29:00.920
I'm not sure I did.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.880
Erm... early 1990.

29:02.960 --> 29:08.760
Right, so... February or March or...

29:08.840 --> 29:13.040
Erm... yes, around about
then. I'm sorry, I can't...

29:13.120 --> 29:16.110
- I can't quite remember exactly.
- No problem. Thanks again.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.760
- You're welcome, thank you.
- Bye.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.500
Cheers.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.590
- Subtle.
- Aren't I?

29:34.640 --> 29:37.840
You might as well have just said,
"Guilty conscience, Mr Osborne?"

29:37.920 --> 29:39.630
Got him sweating though, didn't it?

29:39.680 --> 29:42.780
And I'd put money on him
knowing David Walker.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.190
I need an adjournment.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.510
You're on in two minutes.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.350
And I've just been puking up in the bog.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.950
So, unless the judge wants
his courtroom redecorated,

30:07.000 --> 30:10.100
- I suggest you persuade
him to allow it. - OK.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.450
For some women it only lasts a few months,

30:21.500 --> 30:23.050
whereas for others, it can take...

30:23.100 --> 30:25.330
All I want to know is, am I still fertile?

30:25.380 --> 30:29.420
Well, given your age and the fact
that you haven't had a period

30:29.500 --> 30:32.660
for 18 months, it's pretty unlikely.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.730
I mean, I could still get you
referred to a fertility...

30:38.780 --> 30:40.930
No. No, it's not a problem, really.

30:40.980 --> 30:43.650
It's not a problem at all. Thank you.

30:45.620 --> 30:48.900
He said he hoped she'd die of AIDS.

30:50.540 --> 30:51.940
I just...

30:53.940 --> 30:57.420
I mean, I just thought your temper
issues were so in the past now.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.600
- And they are.
- Right, so you risk your job?

31:01.420 --> 31:05.940
You force us into engaging with
some incredibly unstable couple?

31:06.020 --> 31:09.380
You jeopardise everything because
some twat takes a shot at us?

31:13.300 --> 31:15.300
I'm sorry.

31:16.260 --> 31:18.330
It's all right. It's OK.

31:19.740 --> 31:22.780
- God, I've completely messed up haven't I?
- No, you haven't.

31:24.460 --> 31:28.380
We'll deal with it, OK?
We'll... we'll work it out.

31:28.460 --> 31:31.130
OK, so I think we've got two options.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.450
- We tell Janet...
- No.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.500
Colin, you know the rules. If
any of our circumstances change,

31:36.580 --> 31:38.570
we have a duty to tell
her and make sure...

31:38.620 --> 31:40.570
And how do you think that's going to play?

31:40.620 --> 31:42.930
How happy are they gonna be to leave

31:42.980 --> 31:44.810
an already very vulnerable young girl

31:44.860 --> 31:47.960
with somebody who loses
their temper like that?

31:50.860 --> 31:53.810
Which is, I'm sure, exactly
what you're thinking right now.

31:53.860 --> 31:55.660
Of course I'm not.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.300
If we tell Janet, we could lose Flo.

32:03.420 --> 32:11.420
OK, well, then the second option
is... we give them the money.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.100
I think it's our only choice, love.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.490
I just hope it's enough.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.900
Jase?

32:30.980 --> 32:34.700
Go home, mate. Take a few days
off, you shouldn't be here.

32:39.180 --> 32:41.320
I'm really sorry for you.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.450
- Jase... - Sorry, Cath,
I'm in a bit of a rush.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.620
Oh, OK. No problem.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.770
- Night, then.
- Night.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.130
Are you OK?

34:27.179 --> 34:29.730
Is there any way you could
swap weekends with Melanie

34:29.780 --> 34:31.530
so Becca could go there this weekend?

34:31.580 --> 34:33.580
Er... yeah.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.860
Yeah, fine.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.940
What?

34:38.580 --> 34:41.090
It's just...

34:41.139 --> 34:44.440
Becca's mum's is very noisy
with her stepbrothers.

34:44.820 --> 34:47.210
She has her exams next week, so...

34:47.260 --> 34:50.340
- Oh, right.
- She's really hoping to be able to

34:50.420 --> 34:53.219
revise here in a bit of peace and quiet.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
Fine.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.060
I just...

34:59.140 --> 35:00.850
I do need some space, love.

35:00.900 --> 35:04.300
I'm... I'm finding this all pretty hard.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.900
Yeah, of course.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.480
Well...

35:12.020 --> 35:14.050
- .. I'll speak to her.
- OK.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.570
Thank you.

35:19.220 --> 35:22.420
Anything erm... Anything I can help with?

35:23.700 --> 35:25.240
You wanna...

35:25.900 --> 35:28.370
.. talk to me? Tell me anything?

35:28.940 --> 35:31.370
- Tell you what?
- No, fine, it's just...

35:31.420 --> 35:33.490
Any time you need to...

35:34.620 --> 35:37.060
.. offload, I'm here.

35:37.140 --> 35:38.880
Well, thank you.

36:08.060 --> 36:10.060
Are you all right?

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
Yeah, fine.

36:17.020 --> 36:18.560
Night, then.

36:25.780 --> 36:29.900
So we have four arrests for Sara Alazi,

36:29.980 --> 36:33.460
all in '89 or '90, and
all within a 5-minute walk

36:33.540 --> 36:35.170
of the King's Cross flat.

36:35.220 --> 36:39.700
Erm... on two of those occasions, she
was arrested with the same woman,

36:39.780 --> 36:42.580
a Samira Khan who is still a sex worker.

36:43.700 --> 36:44.970
Impressive.

36:45.020 --> 36:47.780
Er... last arrest was 18 months ago,

36:47.860 --> 36:50.490
for running a brothel just
off the Pentonville Road.

36:50.540 --> 36:53.050
Council tax records have
her down as owning it,

36:53.100 --> 36:56.220
although it is now listed as a spa.

36:56.300 --> 37:00.460
Well, I don't suppose "brothel"
is an option on the form.

37:02.980 --> 37:07.180
Ooh, one more thing. David
Walker was a Tory party fundraiser

37:07.260 --> 37:08.530
for most of the '80s.

37:08.580 --> 37:13.100
Can you ring his wife and see if she
has any photos of him from that time?

37:13.180 --> 37:17.020
Photos of functions they
went to, press clippings.

37:17.100 --> 37:20.540
And if you get no joy
there, ring the party HQ

37:20.620 --> 37:23.570
and see if they have a photo
archive that we can look at.

37:23.620 --> 37:25.820
- Got it.
- Thanks, Jake.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.240
- Got the address.
- Shall we go?

37:46.660 --> 37:48.130
Can I help you?

37:48.180 --> 37:51.500
Hi, I'm DCI Cassie Stewart.
We're looking for Samira Khan.

37:51.580 --> 37:53.850
Yeah, we were very good friends.

37:53.900 --> 37:56.890
And over what period
of time would you say?

37:56.940 --> 37:58.810
When we were working together.

37:58.860 --> 38:02.580
Not long, eight, nine months
maybe, but we stayed friends after.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.500
Right, and so when did she stop?

38:05.580 --> 38:07.450
- Sex work?
- Yes.

38:08.780 --> 38:11.380
Erm... early 1990?

38:11.460 --> 38:14.250
She cleaned herself up
and moved out of London,

38:14.300 --> 38:17.090
but we just stayed in
touch. Phone, letters...

38:17.140 --> 38:22.380
And we'd meet up every few months
in town for a coffee and a natter.

38:22.460 --> 38:24.730
And when was the last time you saw her?

38:24.780 --> 38:27.940
'93, '94, maybe?

38:28.020 --> 38:31.700
But we wrote to each other
until about erm... 1995.

38:31.780 --> 38:33.450
And where was she then?

38:33.500 --> 38:35.410
She was living in Salisbury.

38:35.460 --> 38:39.060
She'd er... done a degree,
I think, and got married.

38:40.420 --> 38:43.660
Yeah, she was always a
smart girl, not like me.

38:45.260 --> 38:48.060
Did you keep any of the letters, Samira?

38:48.420 --> 38:50.420
Sorry, no.

38:50.500 --> 38:54.100
That's no problem. I know
it's a long time ago, but...

38:54.180 --> 38:56.610
do you happen to remember
her married name?

38:56.660 --> 38:59.900
Yeah, I do, cos we joked
about it in the letters.

38:59.980 --> 39:03.300
Mahmoud -- the same as
my mum's maiden name.

39:03.380 --> 39:06.120
I said, "I always knew we'd be family."

39:09.820 --> 39:13.340
Thank you so much, Samira.
You've been incredibly helpful.

39:13.420 --> 39:18.140
No problem. And if you do find her,
send her all my love, will you?

39:18.220 --> 39:21.460
I'm glad she got out. She
was always better than this.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.500
Sex, death and revenge.

39:31.580 --> 39:34.120
Here are three of our main topics.

39:44.220 --> 39:46.290
Are you all right, miss?

39:49.260 --> 39:51.200
Let's look at erm...

39:51.900 --> 39:54.740
.. act three, please, scene four.

40:02.260 --> 40:04.460
"Thanks to Your Majesty..."

40:05.740 --> 40:09.240
Mrs Mahmoud, can we borrow
you for a second, please?

40:19.740 --> 40:23.620
No, sorry. I don't
recognise him I'm afraid.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.460
OK. No problem.

40:27.020 --> 40:31.700
Any idea how your flat address
might have ended up in his pager?

40:32.820 --> 40:36.140
Can I remember why I might have
given some random bloke my address

40:36.220 --> 40:40.140
one night in the '90s?... No, sorry.

40:41.260 --> 40:42.600
Well...

40:44.060 --> 40:46.050
.. do you think there's a chance

40:46.100 --> 40:49.380
that you gave it when he was your client?

40:52.060 --> 40:54.260
What do you mean, "client"?

40:55.060 --> 40:57.000
A punter of yours...

40:58.660 --> 41:01.260
.. when you worked as a prostitute.

41:19.780 --> 41:22.880
Please say you don't
need to tell anyone this.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.580
Here, or my family.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.700
Please.

41:32.780 --> 41:34.300
(Please.)

41:37.140 --> 41:41.580
It was a lifetime ago, I was a
completely different person.

41:43.180 --> 41:46.940
- Sara, if you co-operate with us...
- I will, completely.

41:47.020 --> 41:48.050
I wanna help you.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.770
Then there's absolutely no reason

41:49.820 --> 41:52.940
why anyone but us needs
to know about anything.

41:58.660 --> 42:00.860
I don't know him, I swear.

42:02.260 --> 42:05.260
But, yeah, of course he
could have been a client.

42:09.340 --> 42:12.300
You had a lot of clients, I presume?

42:16.340 --> 42:19.080
I did what I did for less than a year.

42:20.340 --> 42:23.080
I was in a very dark place at the time.

42:28.140 --> 42:31.540
But a year is still a very
long time in that world.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.930
When did he go missing?

42:43.300 --> 42:47.540
May 1990. The 8th, we think.

42:52.380 --> 42:53.980
I was abroad.

42:55.100 --> 42:57.650
I went travelling in Europe early 1990

42:57.700 --> 42:59.530
and was away for most of the year.

42:59.580 --> 43:01.980
You can check passport records.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.570
I was 1,000 miles away.

43:05.580 --> 43:08.100
So, what do you think?

43:08.180 --> 43:09.970
Completely credible.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.360
I agree.

43:12.940 --> 43:14.850
But let's assume she's lying.

43:14.900 --> 43:17.620
Absolutely. I'll check the passport.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.170
After all this fucking...

43:19.220 --> 43:20.810
I've spent 26 years being messed up

43:20.860 --> 43:23.250
by something that never
actually happened, Becs.

43:23.300 --> 43:25.410
I mean, can you imagine
what that feels like?

43:25.460 --> 43:27.330
- No...
- It feels shit, let me tell you.

43:27.380 --> 43:32.100
I can feel this fucking rage inside
cos of the years I've wasted...

43:33.380 --> 43:35.970
I never needed to become the
useless loser that I am now.

43:36.020 --> 43:38.890
And I just... I feel like I
wanna take it out on someone...

43:38.940 --> 43:41.570
- I wanna punch and smash
and hurt someone... - Becca?

43:41.620 --> 43:44.130
- .. except there is no-one
to blame... - Dad? - Jase?

43:44.180 --> 43:46.450
- Jason.
- Hi, Paul. Hi, Mum.

43:46.500 --> 43:49.370
Hiya, sweetheart. Why didn't you
tell us you were coming round?

43:49.420 --> 43:51.770
It wasn't planned, just
needed someone to talk to.

43:51.820 --> 43:54.420
All right. It's OK. Hey, come on.

43:54.500 --> 43:55.930
- You OK? - Mm-hm. - It's all right.

43:55.980 --> 43:58.320
It's fine, it's fine. Come on.

43:58.380 --> 44:01.700
I think we will want to interview
you properly, Mr Gregory,

44:01.780 --> 44:04.010
but that's really helpful for now.

44:04.060 --> 44:06.740
Thanks. Thank you very much. Bye.

44:08.180 --> 44:11.180
Guv, I've just spoken to the friend again,

44:11.260 --> 44:13.570
James Gregory, the restaurant owner.

44:13.620 --> 44:15.730
- OK. - So, the conversation
was pretty brief,

44:15.780 --> 44:16.850
he was on the way to work.

44:16.900 --> 44:19.370
But he was telling me
about David's problems,

44:19.420 --> 44:21.690
his depression, his drinking.

44:21.740 --> 44:23.610
Tessa never told us about that.

44:23.660 --> 44:27.540
Ah, he thought it had a lot to do
with what happened to him as a kid.

44:29.340 --> 44:30.650
Which was?

44:30.700 --> 44:37.020
He said he'd been abused by a
teacher at his primary school.

44:38.900 --> 44:41.090
And in the last few months of his life,

44:41.140 --> 44:43.570
he'd talked a lot about
going to the police

44:43.620 --> 44:45.970
and finally reporting
what had happened to him.

44:46.020 --> 44:50.500
But also, he talked about
confronting his abuser.

44:50.620 --> 44:53.290
And then one day, he just disappears.

44:53.980 --> 44:57.460
And then one day, someone
sticks a knife in his chest.

44:58.305 --> 45:04.520
