happens to be a map
of the Helix Nebula in the
Aquarius Constellation!

00:42.123 --> 00:45.216
Oh, I'm sorry. Nerd baby.

00:46.967 --> 00:50.301
This is so unfair!
How come I can't be a CIT?

00:50.301 --> 00:51.672
Zuri, you're not old enough.

00:51.672 --> 00:54.095
Plus, it's a big job,
with a lot of responsibility.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.227
How hard can it be?
You do it.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.641
It also takes people skills.

Wildfire!

02:04.375 --> 02:05.746
Oh...

02:05.746 --> 02:08.379
When you said we
were going to go play
with wild fire,

02:08.379 --> 02:10.381
I was thinking of something
a lot more fun.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.963
Wildfire is tons of fun!

02:12.963 --> 02:14.595
In a very tiny package.

02:14.595 --> 02:16.387
Just like me!

02:17.348 --> 02:20.431
Okay, have fun
with your big dog.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.103
He's a horse!
Whatever you have
to tell yourself, man.

02:24.525 --> 02:25.726
I'm gonna go
play football.

02:25.726 --> 02:28.899
Okay, campers, I have some
very exciting news to share!

02:28.899 --> 02:32.323
You're gonna let Wildfire
move into our bunk?

02:32.323 --> 02:35.446
Sweet! He's gonna need to
sleep by the window, though,

02:35.446 --> 02:37.368
'cause he gets a little gassy.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.412
Anyway, I am talking about
the Camp Art Auction.

02:41.412 --> 02:45.085
The whole town is coming,
and Gladys put me in charge.

02:45.085 --> 02:46.707
Obvi, as all my friends know,

02:46.707 --> 02:48.339
I am an art aficionado.

02:48.339 --> 02:51.502
Really? 'Cause
I've never heard you
mention art before.

02:51.502 --> 02:54.425
Or friends.

02:54.425 --> 02:55.796
I will have you know,
back in New York,

02:55.796 --> 02:58.389
I ran with a pretty cool crowd
of museum docents.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.222
My bad.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.564
I need you each
to do a painting
for the auction.

03:03.564 --> 03:06.066
Gladys needs money to buy
a "Rump Plumper,"

03:06.066 --> 03:08.229
which apparently
plumps your rump.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.271
(BOTH SHUDDER)

03:11.772 --> 03:13.774
Anywho, if we have
any money left over,

03:13.774 --> 03:17.197
Gladys said we could
use it to buy a telescope
for the camp!

03:17.197 --> 03:20.661
Or we could buy
a micro-drone to hover
over the girls'...

03:21.822 --> 03:23.624
I mean, a telescope.

03:23.624 --> 03:24.875
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

03:24.875 --> 03:25.876
Yay.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.211
Karaoke was
so fun last night!

03:31.211 --> 03:34.465
Taylor Swift
is my spirit animal.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.967
Except that, you know,
she's a human.

03:38.138 --> 03:39.390
She makes me
want to date a guy,

03:39.390 --> 03:40.681
just so I can
dump his sorry butt,

03:40.681 --> 03:42.052
and write a catchy
tune about it.

03:43.684 --> 03:46.477
I wasn't there
so I don't care.

03:49.270 --> 03:53.734
B-T-W, I'm helping you
with the wood

03:53.734 --> 03:55.906
and I even
took out the trash.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.489
And left it on the porch.

03:59.450 --> 04:02.202
Well, it's out!

04:02.202 --> 04:04.865
Great, now bears
can come to our porch
for an appetizer,

04:04.865 --> 04:06.537
and have us as the entree!

04:08.419 --> 04:12.423
(SIGHS) It's not fair.

04:12.423 --> 04:14.545
I wish I was a CIT.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.678
Ahhh! Wow, Hazel,

04:17.678 --> 04:20.140
did you set your broom
to silent?

04:20.140 --> 04:23.594
Gee, you stir
one cauldron...

04:23.594 --> 04:26.517
Anyway, I can make
your wish come true.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.519
You could be my CIT.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.190
Well, what's the catch?

04:30.190 --> 04:32.523
Do I have to shave
Emma's head in her sleep?

04:32.523 --> 04:35.235
No, but that's going
on my bucket list!

04:36.357 --> 04:39.530
Look, I need help
with my Weasels,

04:39.530 --> 04:41.532
you're sick
of the Up-Chucks.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.404
It's a win-win.

04:43.404 --> 04:44.905
I'll think about it.

04:44.905 --> 04:47.458
It's just that your Weasels
are cray-cray.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.710
On the bright side,
when we go on
a hike in the woods,

04:49.710 --> 04:51.672
the bears run from them.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.420
Sophie, is that a vase
or a pile of mush?

04:59.420 --> 05:00.591
Wha...

05:00.591 --> 05:02.222
It looks like the work
of a six-year-old!

05:03.684 --> 05:06.136
Dude, she is six.

05:06.136 --> 05:07.728
That is no excuse!

05:08.639 --> 05:09.390
Wha...

05:10.891 --> 05:11.892
Artists.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.195
Done!

05:15.195 --> 05:16.857
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:16.857 --> 05:19.650
I'm going to go play
horse shoes with Wildfire.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.822
Or as he calls it, shoes.

05:23.654 --> 05:25.616
Jorge, I cannot sell this.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.369
If you were my son,
I would not even hang it
on the refrigerator.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.451
Why? Because
you couldn't lift it?

05:32.292 --> 05:34.625
Griff, please tell me
you have something better.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.756
I do.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.630
I call it  Sad Boy.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.463
An Exploration in Crayon.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.386
I call it "terrible."

05:47.518 --> 05:49.560
There is an elephant
in Thailand

05:49.560 --> 05:51.351
that can paint
better than you!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.313
His art sells
for thousands of dollars!

05:53.313 --> 05:56.186
Well, then call him
so I can go play football.

05:57.147 --> 05:59.109
Look, I promised Gladys

05:59.109 --> 06:00.571
I would deliver big bucks

06:00.571 --> 06:02.573
so she can junk up her trunk.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.786
So, start over!
Both of you!

06:07.698 --> 06:10.120
Corky, the paint goes
on the canvas,

06:10.120 --> 06:11.121
not in your mouth!

06:12.993 --> 06:15.626
Great, thanks to
Vincent Van Jerk,

06:15.626 --> 06:19.259
we're gonna be stuck here
painting all day!

06:19.259 --> 06:21.962
Not necessarily.
What if we tell Ravi

06:21.962 --> 06:23.383
that Wildfire can paint,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.005
just like that
artsy elephant?

06:25.005 --> 06:26.967
But horses can't paint.

06:26.967 --> 06:28.929
They wear shoes
on their hands.

06:29.930 --> 06:31.432
What I meant is,

06:31.432 --> 06:32.893
if we just throw some
paint on a canvas,

06:32.893 --> 06:35.275
and tell Ravi
that Wildfire did it,

06:35.275 --> 06:37.858
he can sell that,
and we can have rest
of the afternoon off.

06:37.858 --> 06:41.692
(CHUCKLES) You had me
at "afternoon off."

06:41.692 --> 06:43.363
That's the last thing I said.

06:43.363 --> 06:47.738
No, that's the
last thing you said.

06:47.738 --> 06:49.790
I'd be better off
planning this with the horse.

06:52.292 --> 06:54.995
Guess what?
We get to go to town later
to see a movie!

06:54.995 --> 06:57.167
You mean a real movie?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.249
Not like the ones
they show here?

06:59.249 --> 07:04.344
The Horror Of Head Lice.
Two Friends, One Hat.

07:04.344 --> 07:07.137
That was better than
Ticks Suck.

07:07.137 --> 07:09.259
Yeah, not our best
double-feature.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.353
Gee, guys, I'm sorry,
but it's after hours.

07:13.353 --> 07:15.686
Only off-duty counselors
and CITs can go.

07:15.686 --> 07:19.439
Great. So the only thing
I get to do after lights out

07:19.439 --> 07:20.981
is hear Tiffany snore?

07:20.981 --> 07:24.945
I have an unusually
large uvula.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.067
Listen, Zuri,
if you're patient,
and follow the rules,

07:27.067 --> 07:28.949
maybe you can be
a CIT next year.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.572
Or I could be one
right now!

07:32.993 --> 07:34.535
Where are you going?

07:34.535 --> 07:37.708
I'm joining the Weasel Cabin!
Hazel asked me to be

07:37.708 --> 07:40.751
her new CIT,
and I'm accepting.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.043
ALL: What!
Are you crazy?

07:43.043 --> 07:44.845
Obviously, Hazel
is an evil witch

07:44.845 --> 07:46.006
who's put you under a spell!

07:46.006 --> 07:48.799
Yes! She's spun a web
and lured you into it!

07:48.799 --> 07:50.721
So what is she,
a spider or a witch?

07:50.721 --> 07:53.724
She's a spider-witch!

07:53.724 --> 07:56.807
Look, Hazel's
my friend now.

07:56.807 --> 07:58.899
She thinks I'm mature, so...

08:20.290 --> 08:24.124
I still can't believe
my own sister betrayed
the Woodchuck Cabin.

08:24.124 --> 08:28.048
Although she did once
try to sell Ravi
to the circus.

08:28.048 --> 08:31.091
I have never lost
a Woodchuck.
Except that one time

08:31.091 --> 08:34.264
we ran into a wolf pack.
And even then, I got
most of her back.

08:35.636 --> 08:36.807
Most of her?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.188
She didn't need
all those toes.

08:39.940 --> 08:43.854
I cannot believe
I'm at The Spot at night!

08:43.854 --> 08:46.106
This is so awesome!

08:46.106 --> 08:47.908
Everyone looks so happy.

08:47.908 --> 08:50.200
Because there are
no kids here.

08:51.201 --> 08:53.323
Yeah, kids
ruin everything.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.617
Oh, hi, guys.

08:56.617 --> 08:59.249
Have you met
my new CIT, Zuri?

08:59.249 --> 09:01.832
Huh. I used to have
a sister by that name.

09:03.754 --> 09:05.255
Look, she's wearing
a Weasel shirt.

09:05.255 --> 09:09.009
Why don't you just
rip my heart out
and eat it in front of me!

09:09.009 --> 09:11.091
That sounds fun!
Get me a spork.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.935
Speaking of eating,

09:14.935 --> 09:16.887
is that real Chinese food?

09:16.887 --> 09:19.139
Hmm. Beats Murphy's
moo goo gai moose.

09:20.851 --> 09:24.354
Congratulations, Lou.
This time you lost
a whole camper,

09:24.354 --> 09:25.816
not just her toes.

09:27.858 --> 09:31.902
I'd like to tie
Hazel's tongue to the tail
of an incontinent wolverine.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.954
That would just be mean
to the wolverine.

you guys asleep?

stay up to do this.

09:50.711 --> 09:52.552
Okay, that wasn't very nice.

09:54.014 --> 09:56.306
At least we didn't use
the one with the brick in it.

10:01.311 --> 10:05.646
Look, Hazel told me
to make sure
you guys were in bed.

10:05.646 --> 10:09.229
So, as your CIT,
I order you
to go to sleep.

10:09.229 --> 10:11.361

around by someone

10:11.361 --> 10:12.993
who still has baby teeth.

coming in behind it!

to share with.

Look, Hazel says
I'm in charge.

10:26.206 --> 10:29.509
Hazel also says Xander
is going to marry her.

10:29.509 --> 10:31.461
The woman is delusional.

10:32.753 --> 10:34.344
Okay, you Weasels.

10:34.344 --> 10:36.466
We can either do this
the easy way,

10:36.466 --> 10:37.808
or the hard way.

10:39.930 --> 10:40.931
Ah!

10:41.972 --> 10:43.563
(SPITS AND GROANS)

10:43.563 --> 10:45.525
I think that was the hard way.

to see this!

for my auction.

lets out in time.

This is going
to help your auction!

11:00.450 --> 11:02.452
We just found out
Wildfire can paint!

11:02.452 --> 11:04.705
What? Horses cannot paint.

11:04.705 --> 11:08.048
This one can.
He's a true artist. See?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.340
Careful! Horse poop!

11:15.505 --> 11:17.007
Thank the gods
I did not ruin my

11:17.007 --> 11:20.010
custom-made,
all-weather
orthopedic sandals.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.512
(WILDFIRE GRUNTING)
Whoa!

11:22.512 --> 11:24.805
Did... Did Wildfire
just paint that?

11:24.805 --> 11:27.017
Yes. Isn't that amazing?

11:28.438 --> 11:31.021
I suppose if
an elephant can paint,
so can a horse.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.363
And I bet those art snobs
would pay top dollar

11:33.363 --> 11:35.115
for these two paintings
made by a horse.

11:35.115 --> 11:37.317
True. As of now,

11:37.317 --> 11:39.910
you are both officially
excused from painting.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.282
BOTH: Yes!
So you can spend
every waking moment

11:42.282 --> 11:43.874
making sure Wildfire paints

11:43.874 --> 11:47.417
a lot more canvases.
BOTH: No!

11:47.417 --> 11:50.831
Your horsey is going
to make us a fortune!
(CHUCKLES)

11:50.831 --> 11:52.332
Hello, telescope!

11:52.332 --> 11:53.293
(SQUISHING SOUND)

11:54.504 --> 11:55.966
And goodbye sandals.

11:59.970 --> 12:04.014
Ow! Whoever named these
"softballs" never dropped one
on their foot.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.108
It's too hot for softball.

12:08.108 --> 12:10.690
We want to go on the water.
So get us a raft,

12:10.690 --> 12:12.312
before we paddle you
across the lake.

12:14.314 --> 12:16.616
Well, since you
asked so nicely...

12:18.618 --> 12:21.281
Watch it! Momma just
took her piggies to town,

12:21.281 --> 12:22.863
and they're still wet.

12:23.954 --> 12:25.075
Hazel!

12:25.075 --> 12:27.577
Your Weasels
are driving me crazy!

12:27.577 --> 12:31.251
I like to think of them
as our Weasels.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.964
And it's the CIT's job
to deal with the campers.

12:33.964 --> 12:35.876
Then what's your job?

12:35.876 --> 12:38.969
To find a CIT
to deal with the campers.

12:38.969 --> 12:42.302
But in Woodchuck Cabin,
Lou always helps Emma.

12:42.302 --> 12:45.015
Lou also plays
the washboard
in a jug band,

12:45.015 --> 12:47.597
and I'm not gonna
do that either.

12:47.597 --> 12:49.519
(SIGHS) Just keep calm,

12:49.519 --> 12:52.392
and think of karaoke
and kung pao.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.527
And...

12:57.527 --> 12:58.528
Done!

12:59.739 --> 13:00.991
Well, that was easy.

13:00.991 --> 13:04.114
Wildfire just did
ten paintings
in five minutes.

13:04.114 --> 13:07.077
No, we did them,
remember?

13:08.408 --> 13:11.041
Okay, I'm gonna go
play football.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.583
And I'm gonna wear a helmet,
so I don't end up like you.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.417
Guys, great news!

13:17.417 --> 13:19.469
The whole town is
coming to my auction,

13:19.469 --> 13:22.512
and, now, the local
TV station is covering it!

13:22.512 --> 13:25.185
We're going to be on
Eye Witness Moose Rump!

13:25.185 --> 13:27.137
Wait, that's the name
of this town?

13:27.137 --> 13:30.690
What names did they
not go with?

13:30.690 --> 13:34.564
Everyone wants to come
to the art auction to watch
Wildfire paint live!

13:34.564 --> 13:36.776
They do?
Thanks to Wildfire's talents,

13:36.776 --> 13:38.318
I will make enough money

13:38.318 --> 13:41.281
to buy Gladys's
Rump Plumper and
a camp telescope!

13:41.281 --> 13:44.204
She will get her bubble,
and I will get my Hubble!

13:44.204 --> 13:45.205
(SQUISHING SOUND)

13:46.446 --> 13:47.497
Dang it!

13:52.913 --> 13:54.334
Campers, huh?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.167
Can't live with 'em,
can't lose 'em in the woods.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.168
(LAUGHS)

14:01.131 --> 14:04.094
Hey, Zuri. Did you finally
get the Weasels to bed?

14:04.094 --> 14:05.345
Sure did.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.768
Chasing me around
with firecrackers really
tuckered them out.

14:10.230 --> 14:13.853
Now, I finally get
to have some fun...

14:13.853 --> 14:16.606
(YAWNS) But first,
I'm gonna get a bite to eat.

14:17.527 --> 14:18.528
(SIGHS)

14:19.189 --> 14:20.440
(SNORING)

14:22.943 --> 14:24.284
Now I feel bad.

14:24.284 --> 14:26.576
Poor Zuri wanted
so much to have fun
with the big kids.

14:26.576 --> 14:28.868
Yeah, but now
she's too pooped
to party.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.869
(LOUD SNORING)

14:33.163 --> 14:34.794
Okay, Wildfire...
(WILDFIRE WHINNIES)

14:34.794 --> 14:36.206
...just paint
on the canvas.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.090
Okay. Just do
what I do, all right?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.675
Maybe he's more
of a sculptor.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.889
I give up.
We can't give up!

14:49.889 --> 14:52.512
When Wildfire can't paint
at the art show,

14:52.512 --> 14:54.394
Ravi will be humiliated!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.816
Jorge, you can lead
a horse to water colors,

14:56.816 --> 14:58.148
but you can't
make it paint.

15:02.112 --> 15:04.234
Guys, I'm worried about Zuri.

15:04.234 --> 15:06.156
This morning I saw
the Weasels in
arts and crafts,

15:06.156 --> 15:07.867
and I think they were
building a coffin.

15:09.119 --> 15:10.951
I miss Zuri so much,

15:10.951 --> 15:13.743
I just short-sheeted
my own bed to
remind me of her.

15:13.743 --> 15:16.206
Yeah, I really miss her, too.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.628
Does my Mozart poster
look level?

15:20.040 --> 15:22.042
(PANTING) Emma, Lou...

15:22.042 --> 15:23.543
I've lost my Weasels!

15:23.543 --> 15:24.754
Congratulations.

15:24.754 --> 15:27.307
I know, that would usually
be a good thing,

15:27.307 --> 15:30.180
but if I don't find them,
I could get in big trouble!

15:30.180 --> 15:31.721
Well, where's Hazel?

15:31.721 --> 15:35.315
Who knows? Probably
out looking for eye of newt
and toe of frog!

15:36.766 --> 15:38.768
Look, I know I
bailed on you guys,

15:38.768 --> 15:41.401
and it probably really
hurt your feelings but...

15:41.401 --> 15:45.195
Yeah, I needed
extra room to grieve,

15:45.195 --> 15:47.157
so I took over
your side of the cabin.

15:49.409 --> 15:50.450
So I noticed.

15:52.332 --> 15:54.704
Anyway, I need you guys.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.496
Will you help me find them?

15:56.496 --> 15:57.877
Of course we'll help you.

15:57.877 --> 15:59.419
Woodchucks don't hold grudges.

15:59.419 --> 16:02.212
Mostly because they have
terrible short term memories.

16:03.343 --> 16:04.884
What were we
talking about again?

16:06.506 --> 16:07.847
Don't worry, we're on it!

16:07.847 --> 16:09.679
I'll use my super-human
tracking skills.

16:09.679 --> 16:13.093
I once tracked
my pet pig, Penelope,
across three states.

16:13.093 --> 16:14.684
Why did she run away?

16:14.684 --> 16:18.558
Little tip. Never kiss a pig
after eating a ham sandwich.

16:18.558 --> 16:19.559
(CLICKS TONGUE) They know.

16:24.064 --> 16:26.196
Howdy, art enthusiasts!

16:26.196 --> 16:29.069
Prepare to be dazzled
by the artistic talents

16:29.069 --> 16:31.571
of Wildfire,
the painting horse!

16:31.571 --> 16:34.534
He is a veritable
Claude Mo-neigh!

16:34.534 --> 16:35.875
(LAUGHS)

16:37.117 --> 16:39.499
Ravi, we need
to talk to you!

16:39.499 --> 16:42.042
Not now. I am schmoozing
the creme de la creme

16:42.042 --> 16:43.963
of the Moose Rump
art community.

16:43.963 --> 16:46.756
I must warm them up
for Wildfire's performance.

16:46.756 --> 16:51.010
Yeah, about that,
there's a teeny, tiny
little problem.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.183
And it could kind of
mess up your auction.

16:53.183 --> 16:55.595
(SCOFFS) Nothing could
mess up my auction!

16:55.595 --> 16:57.477
We have a horse
who can paint!

16:57.477 --> 16:58.478
Do we?

17:02.232 --> 17:05.525
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

17:05.525 --> 17:09.149
for our equine  artiste,
Wildfire!

17:12.282 --> 17:14.744
Ravi! We're trying
to tell you,

17:14.744 --> 17:17.367
Wildfire can't paint.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.498
Yeah. We lied to you.

17:18.498 --> 17:20.370
We did those paintings
ourselves.

17:20.370 --> 17:23.333
What? But
the whole town came!

17:23.333 --> 17:26.296
And  Eye Witness
Moose Rump is here!
With Cletus and Clem!

17:28.298 --> 17:29.929
We're really sorry.

17:29.929 --> 17:33.223
I cannot believe you two!
Why would you do that?

17:33.223 --> 17:35.014
Because you
hated our paintings,

17:35.014 --> 17:36.436
and you mentioned
an elephant,

17:36.436 --> 17:38.228
and Griff wanted
to play football,

17:38.228 --> 17:41.231
and the rest is all a blur!

17:41.231 --> 17:45.605
I have no idea
what you are babbling about,
but thanks to you,

17:45.605 --> 17:47.527
I am going to be
a laughing stock.

17:47.527 --> 17:50.400
In our defense,
you're halfway there
wearing those chaps.

17:53.403 --> 17:56.246
May I please
have your attention?

17:56.246 --> 17:58.828
It is with a heavy heart,
but stylish chaps...

18:01.121 --> 18:02.792
(PEOPLE MURMURING
INDISTINCTLY)

18:02.792 --> 18:04.254
...that I must
inform you...

18:04.254 --> 18:06.336
Ravi, stop talking!

18:06.336 --> 18:07.917
The truth is,
Wildfire cannot...

18:07.917 --> 18:09.129
Ravi! Look!

are starting to bid!

18:18.017 --> 18:21.221
I see one $100!
I see $200!

18:21.221 --> 18:23.723
I see my telescope!

18:23.723 --> 18:26.276
Way to go, Wildfire!
Attaboy!

18:26.276 --> 18:27.277
(WHINNIES)

18:30.730 --> 18:33.323
Okay, I guess
we deserved that.

18:33.323 --> 18:35.405
Now who is
the laughing stock?

18:35.405 --> 18:37.327
Um... Still
the dude in chaps.

18:37.327 --> 18:38.328
(INAUDIBLE)

18:40.660 --> 18:42.162
(SNIFFING) I smell Weasel!

in these woods.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.301
Uh, Lou? We're actually
back at...

18:51.301 --> 18:53.303
Shh! I can't listen
and sniff at the same time.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.057
And the rank stench
of Weasel has led us to...

18:58.598 --> 18:59.599
Our cabin.

19:01.311 --> 19:02.892
Uh-oh.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.724
(YELLING AND SCREAMING)

19:08.147 --> 19:10.400
We've been Weaseled!

19:10.400 --> 19:12.772
Just a little, friendly
cabin rec-reation.

19:12.772 --> 19:14.444
Accent on the wreck!

19:16.236 --> 19:17.577
Quit it, you guys!

19:17.577 --> 19:19.329
I'm going to tell Hazel.

19:19.329 --> 19:21.781
Okay, I put plastic wrap
on the toilet seats

19:21.781 --> 19:23.953
and baby powder
in their hair dryers.

19:23.953 --> 19:24.954
Hazel?

19:26.206 --> 19:27.957
Dang, you're back!

19:27.957 --> 19:30.500
We didn't get to release
the flying cockroaches.

19:34.384 --> 19:37.096
Hazel, you sent us
on that wild Weasel chase?

19:37.096 --> 19:39.429
Wait, is that why
you took Zuri away from us?

19:39.429 --> 19:41.140
Just so you could
trash our cabin?

19:41.140 --> 19:45.395
No, I took Zuri
because I needed
someone to do my work.

19:45.395 --> 19:49.399
Trashing your cabin
just popped into my head.

19:49.399 --> 19:51.611
Like that strange voice
that tells you that
hairstyle looks good?

19:53.773 --> 19:55.575
You are done, spider-witch!

19:55.575 --> 19:58.318
Get ready to meet
Dwayne the Rock Johnson
and Kevin Hart!

19:58.318 --> 20:02.322

a lot smaller
than my left.

20:02.322 --> 20:06.876
Thanks, Lou, but
you can put The Rock
and Kevin away, I got this.

20:06.876 --> 20:10.169
What are you
gonna do about it,
Crybaby In Training?

20:10.169 --> 20:12.211
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

20:12.211 --> 20:17.176
I quit! And you Weasels
are going to clean up
this place, or else!

20:19.679 --> 20:21.261
Or else what?

20:23.433 --> 20:24.434
(GRUNTS)

20:26.225 --> 20:27.767
I didn't see that coming.

20:29.849 --> 20:31.110
Who's next?

20:33.273 --> 20:34.274
I vote for Emma.

20:37.156 --> 20:38.278
And when you're
done running,

20:38.278 --> 20:40.620
you come back here
and clean this mess up!

20:41.621 --> 20:43.242
You can't even lift a raft.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.074
How did you throw Lydia out
the window?

20:45.074 --> 20:46.996
I don't know.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.499
I guess when I saw
what they did,
my adrenaline kicked in,

20:49.499 --> 20:51.961
and it gave me
the strength of ten men.

20:51.961 --> 20:53.212
Or 50 Ravis.

20:55.044 --> 20:57.547
Well, it was awesome!

20:57.547 --> 21:00.179
We should add Weasel Tossing
to the camp Olympics.

21:00.179 --> 21:02.842
Hey, it's one thing
to mess with me,

21:02.842 --> 21:05.094
but you never mess
with the Woodchucks.

21:06.386 --> 21:08.478
Even though I'm not
a Woodchuck anymore.

21:10.019 --> 21:13.313
Sure you are.
Once a Woodchuck,
always a Woodchuck.

21:16.606 --> 21:21.030
Thanks, guys.
You know, I really
missed you.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.822
Even Tiffany's snoring.

I have a gigantic uvula!

21:31.621 --> 21:34.674
It is so great
to have all the Woodchucks
back together again!

21:34.674 --> 21:36.916
And I'm so happy
to have my best friend back.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.378
Aw, thanks, Tiffany.

21:39.879 --> 21:41.631
Emma, Lou...
I didn't realize

21:41.631 --> 21:43.683
being a CIT was so hard.

21:43.683 --> 21:48.768
I just thought it would be
staying out late and getting
my moo shu pork on.

21:48.768 --> 21:50.930
It's not your fault
you couldn't handle
those rabid Weasels.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.523
I sure couldn't.
I'm still having flashbacks.

21:54.694 --> 21:56.065
(SHUDDERS) See?

21:57.527 --> 22:00.149
Meanwhile, to celebrate
Zuri's return,

22:00.149 --> 22:03.613
Lou and I decided
to have a Woodchuck-only
karaoke night.

22:03.613 --> 22:08.498
Awesome! It's going to be
Conway Twitty city!

22:08.498 --> 22:11.371
And Zuri, we know
how bad you wanted
to be a CIT,

22:11.371 --> 22:13.292
but you're still
a little young...

22:13.292 --> 22:16.956
So, we were wondering
if you wanted to be
a CITIT.

22:16.956 --> 22:20.420
Counselor In Training,
In Training!
What's that?

22:21.671 --> 22:24.634
Aw, thanks, guys!

22:24.634 --> 22:27.517
Wait, this doesn't mean
I have to do all your work,
does it?

22:27.517 --> 22:29.519
(INHALES SHARPLY)

22:29.519 --> 22:30.680
You should've
asked that before you

22:30.680 --> 22:31.851
pinned on the badge!
