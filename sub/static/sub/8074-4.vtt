00:00.768 --> 00:03.771
[tone]

00:03.804 --> 00:09.677
[music playing]

00:09.710 --> 00:11.245
Rose, where's that itch cream?

00:11.279 --> 00:14.115
I've got me one fierce bug bite.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.285
Dan, you know that
mirror in the bathroom?

00:17.318 --> 00:20.154
Well, that mirror is
actually a magical door that

00:20.188 --> 00:24.258
opens into a world of medicine.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.527
I looked in the medicine
cabinet, It ain't in there?

00:26.560 --> 00:29.063
Are you sure it was the
medicine cabinet you looked in?

00:29.097 --> 00:30.098
Was it cold?

00:30.131 --> 00:33.234
Was there milk
and beer in there?

00:33.267 --> 00:34.135
Come on.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.903
I can't sleep with the light on.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.439
Well, I can't read
with the light off.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.108
I looked in every shelf.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.176
I even moved a jar.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.277
[shushing]

00:43.311 --> 00:44.745
Come on, if I
don't get some sleep,

00:44.778 --> 00:46.514
I'm going to be in a
bad mood all day long.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.649
Do how is that different
from any other day of the week?

00:48.682 --> 00:49.550
Ha, ha.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.785
Good one, Becky.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.853
I'm tired and I want to sleep.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.288
Turn off the damn light.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.724
I'm not tired, and
I don't want to sleep.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.292
Woah, woah,
where's that cream?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.961
I got me another bite.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.330
You can go
downstairs and read.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.966
You can turn on every
light the damn house then.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.168
I go downstairs and--

01:07.201 --> 01:09.203
They fight for three
days over a light?

01:09.237 --> 01:12.273
No, Dan, they are not
actually fighting about a light.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.575
The light is just an excuse for
what they're really fighting

01:14.608 --> 01:16.244
about, like that
time we had the fight

01:16.277 --> 01:18.846
about you and your bad breath.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.114
What do you mean?

01:20.148 --> 01:23.217
I was actually mad because
you came home late, so you

01:23.251 --> 01:24.185
brushed your teeth for nothing.

01:26.287 --> 01:36.330
[music playing]

01:36.330 --> 01:46.340
[music playing]

02:08.362 --> 02:10.298
[laughter]

02:10.331 --> 02:14.735
[music playing]

02:14.768 --> 02:17.638
Well, Roseanne,
reviews are in.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.107
Our suggestion box is full.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.342
You know what that means?

02:21.375 --> 02:25.879
Yeah, time to get a new
box with no slot on the top.

02:25.913 --> 02:30.117
You know, I wonder how someone
with your obvious people skills

02:30.150 --> 02:32.820
could be afraid of a
little suggestion box.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.222
Well, it's demeaning.

02:34.255 --> 02:38.892
It reminds our regular customers
that they're unable to write.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.495
Well, just remember
there is nothing to fear,

02:41.529 --> 02:46.434
but well everything
that's inside.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.403
Suggestion number one,
the meat is a little dry.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.239
I would agree with that.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.674
Suggestion number 2,
make that up tight

02:53.707 --> 02:57.077
blond guy stop hovering over
us while we're trying to--

02:57.110 --> 02:57.911
eat.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.117
I would agree with that.

03:04.151 --> 03:08.989
Now let's see,
suggestion number three.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.157
Lose the waiter guy.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.459
He reminds me of my mother.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.631
Well, aren't we
clever, Roseanne,

03:17.665 --> 03:19.667
stuffing the suggestion box?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.435
This is your
suggestion, isn't it?

03:21.469 --> 03:22.270
Guess again.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.746
Well, luckily, I don't
value the opinion of anyone

03:32.780 --> 03:36.450
who would choose to eat here.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.451
Sorry I'm late.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.819
The baby kept me up all night.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.888
Well, you married him.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.290
I was up all night, too.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.291
Why?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.492
Because Becky and
Mark were having

03:44.525 --> 03:45.859
a big fight in the next room.

03:45.893 --> 03:50.264
And it's hard to sleep when
you're wearing a stethoscope.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.899
They certainly have been
fighting a lot lately.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.233
Hm.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.702
I try to get Becky to the
talk about it, but she won't.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.036
Oh, it's such a
shame when a daughter

03:56.069 --> 03:58.171
won't talk to her mother about
certain marital problems.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.443
You know.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.411
No, I never said that.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.645
You totally know.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.347
What's going on?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.449
Well, there is
really nothing to tell,

04:08.482 --> 04:12.052
because there's nothing to tell.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.754
Nothing?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.623
so?
How much nothing?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.291
Like five weeks of nothing.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.559
And when you're
trying to have a baby,

04:18.592 --> 04:22.062
that is a whole lot of nothing.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.032
So Becky shut Mark down.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.266
I wonder what his
brain's going to do

04:26.300 --> 04:27.134
with all that extra blood?

04:31.972 --> 04:33.641
Yeah, I guess
one could interpret

04:33.674 --> 04:37.378
the situation in that way if
one only had partial knowledge.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.746
Spill it.

04:38.779 --> 04:43.283
Well, according to Becky, she
is not the one holding back.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.818
- Wow, really.
- Yes.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.220
Mark is just not
interested in sex.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.422
Poor Becky

04:48.456 --> 04:51.792
Yeah, now she'll have
to teach him to talk.

04:51.825 --> 04:55.095
Please, don't tell Becky that
I told you, because I promised.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.530
You know I wouldn't do that.

04:56.564 --> 05:00.734
Besides, my word is every
bit as good as yours.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.803
I Think maybe she felt
more comfortable talking

05:02.836 --> 05:07.174
to someone who might
understand her problem.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.477
Oh, no way.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.079
Your kid's seven months old
and you guys aren't doing it?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.447
No, we're doing it.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.217
But things have
gotten kind of rushed.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.686
Well, rushed is kind of fun.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.953
You know, sometimes
me and Dan try

05:19.987 --> 05:21.254
to race the microwave popcorn.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.332
It's not fun to
rush every time.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.967
Fred is so nervous
about waking the baby up

05:34.001 --> 05:37.270
that he is beginning to
gloss over some vital areas.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.646
Oh my God, are
you talking about?

05:45.679 --> 05:50.217
You mean, he gets in the
elevator, but he won't go down.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.322
If I wasn't gay
before, I would be now.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.894
Well, if you weren't
gay before then,

06:00.928 --> 06:03.631
a whole bunch of guys
owe you a big apology.

06:06.199 --> 06:11.171
Hey, have you gotten really
horny part of pregnancy yet?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.074
Well, you don't see
any delivery boys

06:14.107 --> 06:17.210
circling my house yet, do you?

06:17.244 --> 06:19.179
Well, that must
be tough on Dan,

06:19.212 --> 06:20.848
if you're not all
that interested.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.584
Yeah, he's convinced that it's
because we're stale, you know.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.118
So he thinks he's
getting these ideas

06:25.152 --> 06:28.622
out of these crazy men's
magazines, and stuff to try,

06:28.656 --> 06:29.723
you know.

06:29.757 --> 06:36.063
Like last night, he
wanted to suck my toes.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.598
Did he?

06:37.631 --> 06:38.966
Yeah.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.868
Did it get you excited?

06:40.901 --> 06:41.769
No.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.303
But it got him going.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.237
Really?

06:44.271 --> 06:45.138
Dan?

06:45.172 --> 06:46.239
No!

06:46.273 --> 06:47.708
Well, it turned out
pretty good, you know.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.177
But I wasn't going to
kiss him after that.

06:50.210 --> 06:54.515
[music playing]

06:54.548 --> 06:56.917
[phone ringing]

06:56.950 --> 06:59.820
Hello?

06:59.853 --> 07:02.823
Oh, David Healy.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.892
Now how do you girls keep
getting this phone number?

07:04.925 --> 07:09.062
We've had it changed five times.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.430
It's a Betty Fuller.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.366
And she wants you to go
have coffee with her.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.003
I don't drink coffee.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.005
Coffee is just a code, David.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.372
She's just trying
to be lady like.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.941
She can't just come right
out and say, Nail me.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.114
Mrs. Conner, just
tell her I'm not in.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.818
Yeah, Betty.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.721
Hi, I'm sorry, but
David isn't here.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.256
Apparently, he had
an emergency slouch

07:36.289 --> 07:38.859
and moped seminar to attend.

07:38.892 --> 07:42.162
But I'll let him
know you called.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.397
Thanks.
I think.

07:44.431 --> 07:47.067
Why don't you go out with her?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.201
Betty's a nice person.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.303
I just don't think it
would work out with her.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.005
Well, it doesn't have
to work out with her.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.440
She's a practice girl.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.543
You know, she's like the
frame that you ball before you

07:55.576 --> 07:56.644
actually start keeping score.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.749
Look, I'm just not ready
to have coffee with someone.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.183
When I'm ready to have
coffee with someone,

08:03.216 --> 08:05.118
then I'll have
coffee with someone.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.720
Good afternoon, Family.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.289
Pseudo family.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.190
Boy, do I feel good.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.091
Well, of course you do.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.961
You haven't been here all day.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.663
You are looking
at a man whose crew

08:15.696 --> 08:17.297
just finished the
yearly maintenance

08:17.330 --> 08:18.465
on the school buses.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.399
Five, count them.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.034
Five days early.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.537
City's so pleased,
they're talking bonus.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.506
It will never happen,
but there is talk.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.776
Well, um, David, could you
get out of here, because I need

08:28.809 --> 08:31.378
to speak to Mr. Conner alone.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.780
OH, Roseanne,
don't speak to me

08:32.813 --> 08:38.085
alone, not when I just finished
the school bus five days early.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.988
Mr. Conner wants you to stay
and yet, I want you to leave.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.289
Whatever will you do?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.564
What?

08:50.598 --> 08:52.733
OK, Becky and Mark, they're
having all these sex problems.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.934
And I don't know
all the details.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.804
But after you talk to
Mark, then you fill me in.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.438
I just remembered
something that I have

08:58.471 --> 08:59.406
to deal with that isn't this.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.307
No.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.709
Come on.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.811
Now this is serious because this
could split Becky and Mark up.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.012
And you know how
our daughters are.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.013
They dump them.

09:06.046 --> 09:10.350
And then we're
forced to raise them.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.885
Why don't you talk to Becky?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.754
Because Becky isn't
the one having a problem.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.056
Mark's the one
that won't put out.

09:16.089 --> 09:22.329
Oh, boy, am I swamped
with the noises in my head.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.363
Come on, Dan.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.264
This is serious.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.666
He's got to talk to another man.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.334
No way.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.536
Men don't talk to each other
about this kind of stuff.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.704
Well, I thought
you and Mark were

09:30.738 --> 09:31.872
supposed to be good friends.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.341
- We are friends.
- You men.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.976
You say you have these
great friendships.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.411
But all you really have is
just another hairy person

09:38.445 --> 09:42.115
to eat chips and itch with.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.217
What could be better?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.686
You have to do it, Dan.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.020
You have to do it to help Becky.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.822
No.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.724
I helped my daughter
learn to walk.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.993
I helped my daughter
learn how to ride a bike.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.594
I helped my daughter
with her homework.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.664
But I refused to help
my daughter get some.

09:59.399 --> 10:06.506
[music playing]

10:06.539 --> 10:08.308
I'm telling you,
he could take him.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.209
Couldn't ever.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.044
He could never take Tyson.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.847
I got to go with Bob on
this one He looked pretty old.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.316
I'm not talking about
the Rocky in Rocky 5.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.185
I'm talking about
the Rocky in Rocky 1.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.887
You know, the real Rocky.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.088
All right.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.390
I'll tell you who Rocky
definitely couldn't take.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.059
Terminator.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.527
Well, that's a
completely different thing.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.429
The Terminator guy,
he's not even real.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.600
You know what, you guys?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.168
You ever think we
spend too much time

10:35.202 --> 10:36.737
talking about sports and stuff?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.739
We never talk about
our relationships.

10:43.276 --> 10:47.881
Well, I'll tell you
something about my wife.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.817
She could take Tyson
and the Terminator.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.323
Hey, Dan, I'm serious.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.657
Maybe we should
open up a little.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.559
It wouldn't hurt us to talk
about personal things that

10:59.592 --> 11:00.828
really matter.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.396
Well, I've got
to go to the can.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.366
You can't get much
more personal than that.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.268
This is nuts, guys.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.602
I mean, we're all married.

11:09.636 --> 11:15.976
We've all got marital issues,
like money and love, sex.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.646
Did Roseanne
get a hold of you?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.015
Now take me and Jackie, for
instance, when we first got

11:22.049 --> 11:25.085
married, we had a lot of sex.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.253
Then we went through
a period where

11:26.286 --> 11:28.555
we hardly had any sex at all.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.391
Oh, dear god.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.594
Maybe you're the only
one of you now having sex.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.263
What's that supposed to mean?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.231
I mean, maybe Jackie put
some more men on the job.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.906
OK.

11:45.939 --> 11:46.974
I gave it a shot.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.308
Let's just drop it.

11:48.341 --> 11:52.545
I hit a little bit
too close to home, huh?

11:52.579 --> 11:53.981
Not my home.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.216
It's not my wife who said
she's not getting any.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.456
What the hell are
you talking about?

12:03.490 --> 12:08.461
I know what hasn't been
going on between you and Becky.

12:08.495 --> 12:12.332
I told Roseanne we
shouldn't talk about this.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.301
I mean--

12:14.334 --> 12:15.969
Screw the both of yous.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.607
Dan.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.875
God, Fred, what
were you thinking?

12:21.909 --> 12:22.776
I was trying to help.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.445
The guy's obviously in pain.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.479
He's in a lot more now.

12:26.513 --> 12:30.217
Mark, stop punching that truck.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.119
How in the name of
God did Roseanne

12:32.152 --> 12:33.520
get you to talk to him?

12:33.553 --> 12:34.888
I think she might
be right about this.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.924
Maybe guys should talk more
about this kind of stuff.

12:36.957 --> 12:37.825
Wrong.

12:37.858 --> 12:38.826
we're guys.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.127
When we talk about
sex, there should

12:40.160 --> 12:42.863
be bragging, dirty jokes,
and the occasional Limerick.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.265
That's it.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.666
Women discuss everything.

12:46.699 --> 12:47.801
And they live longer.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.202
No, they don't live longer.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.905
We die sooner from boredom from
listening to their discussions.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.810
I just think if we
could talk about more

12:56.844 --> 12:58.378
intimate stuff the
way that women do,

12:58.411 --> 13:00.747
it would make us feel good.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.649
I got to try to
talk to Mark again.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.952
Fred, haven't you
been listening to me?

13:04.985 --> 13:07.054
Why don't you just
stop and think?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.189
Dan, look, if Mark's having
a little bit of trouble

13:09.222 --> 13:11.391
in the sack maybe he
could use some advice

13:11.424 --> 13:12.960
from a guy who's got
a pretty good track

13:12.993 --> 13:16.163
record in that department.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.098
Kind of counts
you out, don't it?

13:26.874 --> 13:28.608
Excuse me?

13:28.641 --> 13:31.945
My friend, we're
communicating.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.715
Doesn't that make
you feel just great?

13:35.748 --> 13:38.018
Apparently, it's not as
great as Roseanne's toes

13:38.051 --> 13:38.852
make you feel.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.561
All I know is, you're
going to flunk marriage

13:48.595 --> 13:49.696
if you can't pass the oral.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.706
Oh, my God we know too much.

13:59.739 --> 14:00.573
We know too much.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.742
We know too much.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.745
Fred, there is no
graceful way out of this.

14:05.778 --> 14:10.884
So let's just look at
our feet and walk away.

14:13.987 --> 14:17.390
[music playing]

14:18.491 --> 14:30.437
[music playing]

14:30.470 --> 14:35.909
Guess what happened today.

14:35.943 --> 14:39.412
Everyone talked real slow.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.117
How dare you!

14:44.151 --> 14:46.954
Because I felt
like it, that's why.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.655
You know what
I'm talking about?

14:48.688 --> 14:49.923
No, but I don't
like your tone.

14:54.327 --> 14:59.866
I'm talking about you tell
Jackie about the other night.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.568
That?

15:01.601 --> 15:04.837
Yes, that.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.773
What goes on in our
bedroom is sacred.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.807
Oh, yeah.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.542
That's from the Old
Testament, right?

15:09.576 --> 15:12.412
A toe for a toe.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.015
Shut up with that.

15:15.048 --> 15:19.252
Now thanks to you,
Mark and Fred and I

15:19.286 --> 15:21.388
now know stuff about
each other no guy should

15:21.421 --> 15:23.790
ever know about another guy.

15:23.823 --> 15:27.394
And what's worse, we
all know that we know.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.864
Well, it's not easy
being a woman, is it, Dan?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.566
You just don't get it, do you?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.036
It's going to take years of us
guys not talking to each other

15:36.069 --> 15:39.039
to get back to where we were.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.640
Well, why don't you
just cut your tongues out?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.309
We all know that Fred
doesn't need his.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.985
I can play this little
game too, Roseanne.

15:52.019 --> 15:55.855
How would you like it if I told
everyone our personal stuff?

15:55.888 --> 15:57.991
What if I told everybody
that you're not

15:58.025 --> 16:00.393
too interested in sex lately?

16:00.427 --> 16:02.395
Well, yeah, why don't you go
tell everybody that your wife

16:02.429 --> 16:03.563
turns all time for sex.

16:03.596 --> 16:07.734
That would really embarrass me.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.037
This sucks.

16:10.070 --> 16:10.937
Fine, Mark.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.272
Just drive off, you jerk.

16:16.776 --> 16:17.677
I can't believe Aunt Jackie.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.846
I confided a huge secret to her.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.114
And then she went and told Fred.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.949
And now Mark is
madder than ever.

16:22.982 --> 16:23.850
I know.

16:23.883 --> 16:24.684
We all know.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.221
What?

16:28.255 --> 16:30.523
Well, your Aunt Jackie
is a huge blabbermouth

16:30.557 --> 16:32.859
and she tells
everybody everything.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.594
You should hear what she
told about your father.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.428
Roseanne!

16:38.165 --> 16:39.432
This is great.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.902
so everyone knows that my
husband finds me repulsive.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.505
Oh, Becky, nobody thinks that.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.339
Just leave me alone.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.344
Well, I hope you're happy.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.247
You just managed to make
everyone's life worse.

16:54.281 --> 16:57.750
Yes, and I'm exhausted.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.920
I could use a little
help next time.

17:00.953 --> 17:07.327
[music playing]

17:07.360 --> 17:08.328
Hi.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.762
I brought you up some dinner.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.098
Everybody was real
hungry, though,

17:11.131 --> 17:14.033
so it's mostly just peas.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.235
I don't want any.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.845
Becky, remember when
you were a little girl.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.615
And I used to come up here
and sit on the bed with you.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.417
And I used brush your hair.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.286
And you'd tell me about all the
stuff that happened to that day

17:33.320 --> 17:35.322
in school.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.957
We never did that.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.360
Well, I always wanted to.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.328
Mom, I should be studying.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.133
You know, Becky.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.900
This problem that you
and Mark are having.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.469
Mom, I'm really not
comfortable talking

17:49.502 --> 17:50.370
about this with you.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.271
Well, why not?

17:51.304 --> 17:52.739
We're two married, mature women.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.975
And I think that we can
talk about, you know, it.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.211
Mom.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.046
It's one of the great
things about being women,

18:00.079 --> 18:03.616
you know, we can talk intimately
in a way that men can't.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.884
You know, sober.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.957
Mom, I'm pretty sure I
know what Mark's problem is.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.260
He's feeling like I'm moving
away from him, because I'm

18:13.293 --> 18:15.562
going to school and he's not.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.663
Oh, yeah.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.030
Well, that makes sense.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.699
That's really good.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.501
I know this is not
my fault. I mean,

18:21.534 --> 18:22.569
Mark's just feeling insecure.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.070
And he needs to work it out.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.505
Well.
well, that's great.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.739
See?

18:26.773 --> 18:31.244
See, this kind of girl
talk can really help a lot.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.914
Well, I got most
of from David.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.251
You girl talked with David?

18:38.285 --> 18:41.120
Talking to David made
me feel a lot better.

18:41.154 --> 18:44.591
I bet it made you
feel taller too?

18:44.624 --> 18:45.725
You ready to go?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.194
Where are you going?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.127
Just to talk.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.496
David's really sweet.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.563
Well, I'm sweet.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.233
How come nobody
ever talks to me.

18:53.266 --> 18:56.736
We're just going to
go have some coffee.

18:56.769 --> 19:00.373
David is not ready for coffee.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.275
Yeah, I think I am.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.543
Don't you think
you should be having

19:03.576 --> 19:06.112
coffee with your own husband?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.880
Mark doesn't want any.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.782
Hey, if Mark's not
interested in having coffee,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.150
then I'll have coffee with her.

19:15.755 --> 19:23.230
[music playing]

19:23.263 --> 19:26.466
So I had to hear it
again from Dan last night.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.702
I don't cuddle enough.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.070
Oh, man, cuddling?

19:35.107 --> 19:36.376
I hate it.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.578
I work hard all day.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.946
I come home.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.014
I want my dinner.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.716
Little zippety doo da.

19:47.119 --> 19:47.987
Slap him on the ass.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.921
I'm out like a light.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.064
I always take a couple extra
minutes with Dan, you know,

19:58.097 --> 19:59.432
to finish him off.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.834
Otherwise, I have to lay
there and listen to him gripe.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.640
I really feel bad about
what happened in the garage

20:07.674 --> 20:10.610
the other day.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.511
I know.

20:11.544 --> 20:15.014
I really hurt you, Mark.

20:15.047 --> 20:15.982
I wanted to call you.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.450
But I just didn't
feel like I could.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.053
You can call me, Fred.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.088
Anytime, you know that.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.257
Even if it's just the talk.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.694
You see, Mark we don't
always get that from you.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.229
I mean, sometimes you seem so--

20:30.263 --> 20:32.465
Distant.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.333
I know.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.936
And I don't mean to be.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.671
Oh, this is delicious, Dan.

20:44.110 --> 20:44.977
Yeah?

20:45.011 --> 20:47.547
But how many calories?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.115
Oh, like you should worry.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.623
Hey, now, I've got
my problem areas.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.458
Oh, please, I would
trade my waistline

20:58.491 --> 20:59.492
for your thighs any day.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.865
Why don't you roosters
give it a rest, huh?

21:05.898 --> 21:07.734
There'll be plenty to
gossip about tomorrow.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.471
Roseanne, please.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.845
And while we're on the
subject there, cupcake,

21:18.878 --> 21:21.213
I think you could do
without that pudding.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.691
Why must you always embarrass
me in front of my friends?
