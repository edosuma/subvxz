Welcome!

02:32.191 --> 02:33.724
Welcome!

02:37.687 --> 02:40.534
Um, so, tonight, we are so excited

02:40.559 --> 02:44.694
to present to you just some
of the 157 songs that we...

02:44.719 --> 02:47.693
I know, I know...

02:47.762 --> 02:50.288
Uh, from the Crazy
Ex-Girlfriend songbook.

02:50.765 --> 02:53.732
"Songbook" was their cue,
so that was very important.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.070
Yes. Yes.

02:59.176 --> 03:01.460
Now, uh, because this
whole concert has to air

03:01.485 --> 03:04.987
in 42 minutes on The CW, we
have to be very expeditious,

03:05.012 --> 03:07.279
so I am going to both introduce the show

03:07.304 --> 03:09.559
and change into my next outfit.

03:09.584 --> 03:11.517
This is my dresser, Tommy Marquez.

03:14.055 --> 03:15.554
♪ He's single. ♪

03:15.579 --> 03:17.012
Um...

03:17.325 --> 03:18.858
See? I'm helping.

03:18.883 --> 03:21.451
Um, Tommy has seen me naked many times.

03:21.606 --> 03:23.673
Many times. Um, if Tommy had a nickel

03:23.698 --> 03:25.664
for every time he'd seen my nipples,

03:26.108 --> 03:27.710
he would have an answer that I can't say

03:27.735 --> 03:29.695
because it was redacted
by Standards and Practices

03:29.720 --> 03:31.622
for being too dirty of a joke.

03:32.903 --> 03:34.250
I like how I'm behind a changing screen,

03:34.275 --> 03:37.176
but the balcony can see everything.

03:39.224 --> 03:41.357
So, now, I'd like to introduce

03:41.382 --> 03:43.469
my two Crazy Ex-Girlfriend songwriters.

03:43.494 --> 03:46.572

Mr. Adam Schlesinger.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.279
And now...

03:55.731 --> 03:57.698
I am changed.

04:01.090 --> 04:04.380
Coming up is a song that
manages to be both feminist

04:04.405 --> 04:07.006
and anti-feminist at the same time.

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...
We have a lot of fun,

26:26.669 --> 26:30.437
but really, it is, at its
heart, an earnest tribute

26:30.709 --> 26:33.484
to the art of musical theater.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.251
From Gilbert and Sullivan

26:41.965 --> 26:43.684
to Hamilton.

26:44.496 --> 26:46.920
We've done neither of those genres.

26:51.103 --> 26:52.903
So when we sat around and we thought,

26:52.928 --> 26:54.128
let's do an actual,

26:54.196 --> 26:56.986
inspirational musical theater song,

26:57.011 --> 26:59.366
we could think of no one
better to do it justice

26:59.729 --> 27:01.612
than Miss Vella Lovell.

27:03.850 --> 27:05.950
No. Yeah.

27:06.484 --> 27:08.552
So, no. So, Rachel,

theater person at all.

27:11.267 --> 27:12.556

27:12.581 --> 27:14.426

Oh, Lord.

29:11.035 --> 29:13.235
So,

29:13.260 --> 29:14.570
I think one of the
most gratifying things

29:14.595 --> 29:16.355
about doing this show
is having people tell us,

29:16.380 --> 29:19.618
um, that-that sometimes,
they see things in the show

29:19.643 --> 29:22.578
or hear songs that make them
feel, uh, a little less alone.

29:22.603 --> 29:24.370
Um, but what you might not know is,

29:24.395 --> 29:27.226
it's kind of the same
thing for the songwriters

29:27.251 --> 29:28.540
and-and the writers, too.

29:28.565 --> 29:30.651
There are certain songs you write, uh,

29:30.676 --> 29:33.232
and lyrics that you write or
pieces of dialogue you write

29:33.257 --> 29:35.958
that you're like, "Ugh, am I
the only one who's felt this?

29:35.983 --> 29:38.488
Am I, like, the weirdo? Is
this gonna go over well?"

29:38.513 --> 29:41.781
And so just know when you
say that you feel less alone,

29:41.960 --> 29:44.427
you make us feel less alone.
