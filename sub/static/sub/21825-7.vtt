I would absolutely

00:59.994 --> 01:01.629
do things differently.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.598
I would be much more aware.

a guy here, huh?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.859
Brand-new planet, nobody knows
your dating history.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.360
What the hell does that mean?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.028
Nothin'. It's just that
you've gone through

10:28.062 --> 10:29.663
two guys in two months.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.999
Well, I told you, it's just
really hard to find a guy

10:32.032 --> 10:34.134

about my abilities.

10:34.168 --> 10:36.603

you dumped Andy?

10:36.636 --> 10:40.174
Mostly, but also...

10:40.207 --> 10:41.308
he danced weird.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.010
-What?
-Weird how?

10:43.043 --> 10:44.211
Too grindy.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.379
A little grindy can be good.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.314
Yeah, but this was
really grindy.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.722

10:55.755 --> 10:57.724
-Lieutenant, stop it.
-This is it, right?

10:57.757 --> 10:59.126
Huh?
This is that Goldilocks grind.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.996

Lieutenant, knock it off
right now. That's an order.

All right, all right.
I was just trying to help out.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.268

don't you understand?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.705
There's the cafe, come on.

11:11.738 --> 11:15.142
And there's great concern about
the level of contamination

11:15.175 --> 11:16.710
due to industrial waste
in the South Madaka reservoir.

11:16.743 --> 11:19.146
But you can't deny facts.
74% of the population

11:19.179 --> 11:21.548

11:21.581 --> 11:23.150

get out of here right now,

Oh, God, that was too forward,
wasn't it?

12:12.299 --> 12:13.600
Was that too forward?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.935
Nah. No.

12:14.969 --> 12:16.203

12:16.236 --> 12:17.938
I wish somebody
would poke me today.

12:17.972 --> 12:19.473
(chuckles)

12:19.506 --> 12:21.408
What happened to your nose?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.611
It's a deviated septum.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.147
She's a coke addict.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.216
Ma'am, have you seen either
of these two men?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.951
You're kidding me, right?

12:30.985 --> 12:32.219
Everybody knows these guys.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.787
Why does everyone know them?

12:33.820 --> 12:36.756
They got corrected,
like a month ago.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.758
What do you mean by corrected?

12:38.792 --> 12:40.227
-(rapid trilling)
-MAN (on TV): Breaking news...

12:40.260 --> 12:42.529
-Oh, my God.
-John, your badge.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.235
Oh, my God, what did you do?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.004
-Commander, look.
-MAN (on TV): Again,

12:50.037 --> 12:51.638
what you are seeing here
is a man

12:51.671 --> 12:53.073
performing what appears to be

12:53.107 --> 12:55.575
a lewd act on a statue
of Mella Giffenden.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.945
This was recorded just a few
minutes ago and uploaded.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.480
The Feed is understandably

13:00.514 --> 13:02.149
not happy about it,

13:02.182 --> 13:03.350
and voting has already begun.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.452
The badge code has been
identified,

13:05.485 --> 13:08.122
so get out those mobile devices
and cast your vote now.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.424
Oh, my God,
you're already above 500,000.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.825
You need to
get out of here, now.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.128
-Wait, what does that mean?
-Get out of here. Now! Go!

13:14.161 --> 13:15.062
Come on, let's go.

13:18.332 --> 13:19.633
MAN:
Hey!

13:19.666 --> 13:21.301
Hey, that's the guy!

13:22.636 --> 13:25.072
(crowd clamoring)

13:29.243 --> 13:31.311
-What's going on here?
-I...

13:32.179 --> 13:33.647
Grayson to Orville.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.382
-Mercer here, go ahead.
-Captain, there's something

13:35.415 --> 13:37.017
going on down here.
Some kind of social hysteria

13:37.051 --> 13:39.153
surrounding Lieutenant Lamarr.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.887
Show some respect
for your country, jerk.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.322
Hey, chill out.

13:43.890 --> 13:44.824
Kelly, what's happening?

13:44.858 --> 13:46.326
John dry-humped a statue.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.327
What?

13:47.361 --> 13:49.229
Get out of the way!

13:50.664 --> 13:51.698
(rapid beeping)

13:53.700 --> 13:55.169
We got to get out of here now.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.636
I'll contact you
from the shuttle.

13:56.670 --> 13:57.804
Grayson out.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.872
Get out of the way.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.407
We got to move, guys. Come on.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.508
-Come on, let's move.
-Get out of the way.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.742
Move.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.078
Come on, we gotta move.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.212
Hold it right there!

14:07.714 --> 14:09.349
You're under arrest.

14:24.131 --> 14:27.167
Exactly what did your navigator
do down there?

14:27.201 --> 14:31.271
I'm told he dry-humped a statue.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.173
Oh, my God.

14:33.207 --> 14:35.109
What kind of ship are you
running out there, Captain?

14:35.142 --> 14:37.544
Look, Admiral,
he's an impulsive guy, yes,

14:37.577 --> 14:39.179
but he's fantastic at his job.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.915
Part of his job
is to maintain a low profile

14:41.948 --> 14:44.451
when observing lesser-developed
alien cultures.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.187
I-I know that, and I promise
it will not happen again.

14:47.221 --> 14:50.190
I will personally order him..

14:50.224 --> 14:52.726
not to hump things,
but in the meantime,

14:52.759 --> 14:54.528
request clearance
to extract him.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.363
Absolutely not.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.198
Look, sir,
just hear me out on this, okay?

14:58.232 --> 15:01.468
Let's say we reveal ourselves.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.070
We go in there,
we tell them what happened.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.640
This is a culture at the 21st
century level of development.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.208
Knowledge
of extraterrestrial life

15:08.242 --> 15:11.578
could unify them
in a profound way.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.813
Or it could plunge them
into a panic,

15:13.847 --> 15:15.415
or some worse degree
of upheaval.

15:15.449 --> 15:17.751
I'm sorry, Captain.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.253
Your man screwed up.

15:19.286 --> 15:22.088
He's going to have to play
by their rules.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.324
Tucker out.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.196
(Willks sighs)

15:31.331 --> 15:35.269
Sorry to keep you waiting, John.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.403
Is it "John"?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.238
Yeah. That's-that's right.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.173
That's an unusual name.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.340
Is it Kelvic?

15:40.374 --> 15:42.176
Yeah. Sure.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.144
Well...

15:44.178 --> 15:46.180
John...

15:46.213 --> 15:49.416
you've gotten yourself in a bit
of a situation, haven't you?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
I don't know. You tell me.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.252
Last time I checked,

15:52.286 --> 15:54.154
you only arrest someone
if they've committed a crime.

15:54.188 --> 15:58.525
Uh-huh. And what would you call
a million downvotes?

15:58.558 --> 16:01.161
Look man, I just danced
with a statue, that's all.

16:01.195 --> 16:02.496
Why don't you start
by telling me

16:02.529 --> 16:04.298
your version of what happened,

16:04.331 --> 16:06.533
-from the beginning. -If I told
it from the beginning,

16:06.566 --> 16:08.134
you'd crap your pants
and pass out.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.636
(laughs)

16:09.669 --> 16:11.271
Trust me, I've heard it all.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.473
There's nothing you can say
that will shock me.

16:13.507 --> 16:15.309
Want to bet?

16:15.342 --> 16:18.312
Look, I'm just here to help you.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.280
Are you supposed to be
my lawyer or something?

16:20.314 --> 16:22.782
-Your what?
-My lawyer.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.118
I'm not familiar with that term.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.120
You know, with everything
I've seen today,

16:27.153 --> 16:29.022
I'm not the least bit surprised.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.690
I'm your publicity officer.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.126
I'm here to help guide you
through your apology tour.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.629
Okay, wait. Now I'm really lost.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.197
What the hell is that?

16:37.231 --> 16:41.167
(laughs) You-you don't know
what an apology tour is?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.303
John, they happen every day.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.738
How can you not be aware of...

16:44.771 --> 16:46.906
Let's say I'm not aware, okay?

16:46.940 --> 16:48.408
Let's say, right,

16:48.442 --> 16:50.710
I'm the dumbest
son of a bitch you've ever met.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.546
Now with that in mind,

16:52.579 --> 16:55.849
why don't you explain
my situation to me?

16:55.882 --> 16:57.884
Okay.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.520
You performed
a disrespectful act

17:00.554 --> 17:04.358
on a statue commemorating
frontier hero Mella Giffenden.

17:04.391 --> 17:08.094
It was caught on video and
uploaded to the Master Feed.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.764
You received over one million
downvotes from the public,

17:10.797 --> 17:14.167
which makes what you did
a crime against the State.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.035
You will now begin
an apology tour,

17:16.069 --> 17:18.338
during which the people
will vote on whether or not

17:18.372 --> 17:20.106
they believe your sincerity.

17:20.139 --> 17:22.208
If your downvotes remain
under ten million,

17:22.242 --> 17:25.211
you'll be free to go.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.113
(laughs)

17:27.146 --> 17:28.214
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.216
(laughing):
Wait. I'm sorry...

17:33.820 --> 17:35.622
All that crap you just said,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.257
that-that's real?

17:37.291 --> 17:38.792
Aw, you got to be kidding me.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.794
That's how
the justice system works.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.129
Which I think you know.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.964
Okay, wait, so...

17:44.998 --> 17:47.567
uh, what happens
if they don't believe me?

17:47.601 --> 17:49.035
You will undergo
social correction

17:49.068 --> 17:50.970
to prevent future
transgressions.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.407
What's that,
social correction?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.108
(clears throat)
You will receive

17:55.141 --> 17:57.611
a series of neurological
treatments

17:57.644 --> 18:01.448
to pacify any and all
potentially negative impulses.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.452
Okay, now I ain't laughing.

18:11.325 --> 18:12.592
Mercer to Grayson.

18:12.626 --> 18:13.860
What's the latest?

18:14.961 --> 18:16.396
No change, Captain.

18:16.430 --> 18:17.664
We're waiting for them
to bring him out.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.998
ED: I still want to know
how the hell

18:19.032 --> 18:20.667
a member of my crew
let this happen.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.935
KELLY:
It was my fault.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.403
I take full responsibility.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.305
Do you have any idea
how bad this is?

18:25.339 --> 18:27.240
Ed, I'll fix it. I promise.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.642
ED:
No surprise,

18:28.675 --> 18:30.677
the admiral denied us clearance
to extract him.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.278
So, what are we up against?

18:32.312 --> 18:34.280
This whole society
seems to operate

18:34.314 --> 18:36.483
on some kind of points system.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.352
I mean, these badges
everyone wears,

18:38.385 --> 18:40.019
the Feed on every wall,

18:40.053 --> 18:41.688
-John's arrest...
-Okay. Your guy's here.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.256
You got five minutes.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.624
Okay, they just brought him out.
I got to go.

18:44.658 --> 18:47.527
I'll contact you when I can.
Grayson out.

18:50.364 --> 18:52.366
Lieutenant, are you okay?

18:52.399 --> 18:55.201
Yeah, I'm all right.
But, Commander, t-this is crazy.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.303
They want me to do
some kind of apology tour

18:57.337 --> 18:59.373
that's supposed to decide
if I'm guilty or not.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.640
Well, that fits right in
with everything else

19:00.674 --> 19:02.676
about this place.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.143
I don't suppose the Orville
could send down an armed party

19:04.177 --> 19:05.979
and we just blast
our way out of here.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.348
The captain couldn't get
clearance from the Union.

19:08.382 --> 19:12.151
We're gonna have to work
within the laws of this society.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.687
Is the captain mad?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.955
Well, he's more mad at me.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.190
(sighs)
Good.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.126
Listen, uh,
they said I could take

19:20.159 --> 19:21.361
one person with me on the tour.

19:21.395 --> 19:23.162
I'd like it to be you.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.665
Of course. I'll do
everything I can to help.

19:25.699 --> 19:27.667
We're gonna get you
out of this, don't worry.

19:27.701 --> 19:29.302
ALARA:
John.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.004
Did they tell you
what happens if you lose?

19:31.037 --> 19:32.506
It doesn't sound good.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.741
They put you through
some kind of brain fry

19:34.774 --> 19:36.710
that's supposed to get rid
of all the bad stuff.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.979
This is a 21st century level
society.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.347
They don't have
the medical sophistication

19:41.381 --> 19:43.016
to do that safely.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.785
Commander, he could end up
a mental vegetable.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.758
-Hey, I'm a spaceman! You got
to let me out of here! -Shh!

19:51.791 --> 19:54.494
-I'm a spaceman! Hey! -Don't
make this worse for yourself.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.330
Come on.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.266
Okay, let's say...

20:00.299 --> 20:02.101
let's say he loses.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.738
Would you be able to reverse
any damage to his brain?

20:04.771 --> 20:06.440
I don't know.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.242
I'd have to examine someone
who's had the procedure.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.444
The question is, who?

20:10.477 --> 20:12.378
The missing anthropologists.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.114
Remember the girl from the cafe
said that they'd been corrected.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.183
-They must've done something.
-That makes sense.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.253
Everyone we talked to
seemed to recognize them.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.921
What in the hell
could they have done?

20:21.955 --> 20:24.458
Lewis isn't exactly the type
to hump a statue.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.325
We've got to locate those men.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.796
I'm sorry, John,
I got to pull you away.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.131
The Chat needs you on set
in 20 minutes.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.132
The Chat?

20:33.166 --> 20:35.301
Yep. Put your game face on.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.604
Here we go.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.452
Now remember,
humility is the key.

20:52.486 --> 20:54.120
You're extremely ashamed
of your lack of judgment,

20:54.153 --> 20:56.255
and you're prepared
to accept society's verdict

20:56.289 --> 20:58.157
with wholehearted respect.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.926
And don't forget
to mention the donation.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.127
I got it, all right?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.428
Believe me, I'm gonna just

21:02.462 --> 21:04.097
go out there and kiss ass.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.264
Yeah, but not too much.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.666
If they think you're pandering,

21:06.700 --> 21:08.101
they'll smell it.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.969
Just be yourself, but be humble.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.238
(audience applauds)

21:12.271 --> 21:14.273
-(music plays)
-(cheering, whooping)

21:18.311 --> 21:21.114
-WOMAN: Okay, welcome back
to The Chat. -(music stops)

21:21.147 --> 21:23.149
It is voting time,
and today we've got one

21:23.182 --> 21:24.851
I'm sure you're all aware of.

21:24.884 --> 21:28.287
Have you guys seen this video
of the guy with the statue?

21:28.321 --> 21:29.989
-(audience groaning)
-It's pretty disgraceful.

21:30.023 --> 21:32.258
This man was caught on video

21:32.291 --> 21:33.593
simulating a sexual act

21:33.627 --> 21:36.029
with a statue
of Mella Giffenden,

21:36.062 --> 21:38.264
and it has justifiably
angered a lot of people.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.533
We have the video here.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.000
Let's take a look.

21:41.034 --> 21:43.603
Is it too grindy
or not grindy enough?

21:43.637 --> 21:45.371
-(audience exclaims)
-Ugh.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.440
(audience groaning)

21:47.473 --> 21:49.843
And that's not even how I do
sex. I was-I was just dancing.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.277
Um... humility.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.445
Oh, wow,

21:52.478 --> 21:54.347
that is just horrible.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.182
Totally agree.
Look at the Master Feed.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.217
Everybody's talking about it.

21:58.251 --> 22:00.820
"He has no respect for
his nation," says one person.

22:00.854 --> 22:03.456
"We don't need people like that
in our society," says another.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.124
"Correct him now."

22:05.158 --> 22:06.693
Obviously, people are

22:06.726 --> 22:09.729
very passionate about this,
so let's bring him out.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.898
Ladies and gentlemen,
John Lamarr.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.700
-(music playing)
-Okay, go.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.368
(audience booing)

22:21.274 --> 22:22.441
(music stops)

22:24.443 --> 22:26.245
-I just had to do that.
-Good girl.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.915
Okay, so let's
get straight to it,

22:28.948 --> 22:30.516
because everybody wants to know

22:30.550 --> 22:32.518
why would you do something
so blatantly

22:32.552 --> 22:35.855
demeaning to the image
of someone who is

22:35.889 --> 22:38.091
so universally respected
by our country?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.927
Well, I deeply regret
my actions,

22:40.960 --> 22:43.930
and I'm very, very sorry
and it will not happen again.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.264
Peace.

22:45.298 --> 22:46.833
I don't know.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.234
Does he sound sorry?

22:48.267 --> 22:49.502
-I don't think so.
-JOHN: No, I-I am.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.170
I-I really am.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.739
I had a momentary lapse
in judgment,

22:52.772 --> 22:54.941
and I'm aware
that I caused offense

22:54.974 --> 22:57.243
to a great many people
and I sincerely apologize.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.511
-(Semmla scoffs)
-(John stammers)

22:58.544 --> 23:00.179
I'm not even that kind of guy.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.181
Grayson to Orville.
Are you watching?

23:02.215 --> 23:03.416
We're seeing it.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.718
I like soda.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.219
I'm a good driver.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.055
Who would need such a large cup?

23:09.088 --> 23:11.224
ED: Kelly, what the hell
kind of circus is this?

23:11.257 --> 23:13.526
You're telling me
this is their legal process?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.395
We haven't seen evidence
of any codified legal framework.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.231
(over comm): I mean, it all
seems subject to public vote

23:18.264 --> 23:19.298
at any given time.

23:19.332 --> 23:21.534
Captain, what she is describing

23:21.567 --> 23:24.738
is an absolute,
unstructured democracy.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.941
There is no record of any
previously discovered society

23:27.974 --> 23:29.375
operating in such a fashion.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.044
Government by American Idol.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.246
What is American Idol?

23:33.279 --> 23:35.782
That was a form of entertainment
from old Earth.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.251
People competed to see who had
the best singing voice.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.285
Why?

23:39.318 --> 23:41.120
I don't know.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.722
It was a dark time.

23:42.756 --> 23:45.358
I sing.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.763
Okay, I just want
to jump in here.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.298
You know, we talk to a lot of
different people on this show

23:52.331 --> 23:54.567
and I got to say, your apology
sounds very rehearsed.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.235
SEMMLA:
Yeah, it does.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.237
(audience booing)

23:58.271 --> 24:00.640
Do something.

24:00.674 --> 24:03.009
I can't. It's up to him.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.177
N-No, no, I-I swear to God.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.012
I-I'm so, so completely sorry.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.180
N-No BS.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.148
I-I even donated

24:09.182 --> 24:11.785
to the Mella Giffendon
Foundation for Jacked-Up Kids.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.287
The Foundation
for Disadvantaged Children.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.022
Right. That's-that's the one.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.423
Uh, I gave a whole bunch
of money.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.424
HOSHEL:
Really?

24:18.457 --> 24:19.625
How many lods?

24:19.659 --> 24:22.195
-Oh, so many lods.
-How many?

24:22.228 --> 24:24.597
I just walked in there
and I made it rain lods.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.265
I was like, boom.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.434
-Lods for ev...
-CARRIS: I have a question.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.704
Can you tell us
what Mella Giffendon did

24:30.737 --> 24:33.272
that made her such a hero?

24:33.306 --> 24:35.308
-Oh, no.
-What?

24:35.341 --> 24:37.210
We didn't cover this.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.212
She was... she did
a lot of things,

24:39.245 --> 24:40.947
a lot of good things.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.116
Th-that's why there's a statue.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.685
Y-Y-Y-You don't get
a statue just sitting around.

24:45.719 --> 24:48.387
She got up, she got out,

24:48.421 --> 24:50.123
and she did what's what

24:50.156 --> 24:52.191
and that's why there's a statue.

24:52.225 --> 24:53.626
Name one thing she did.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.896
She saved the whale forests.

24:56.930 --> 24:59.298
SEMMLA (over monitor):
He can't even name one thing.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.700
Oh, my God.
How about leading

25:00.734 --> 25:02.668
an entire settlement
of pioneers, for one.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.003
CARRIS (over monitor): Okay,
I think we've heard enough.

25:04.037 --> 25:06.005
-Yeah.
-Let's vote. Shall we vote?

25:06.039 --> 25:07.673
-Yeah. Let's vote.
-(applause, cheers)

25:07.707 --> 25:09.575
HOSHEL (over monitor): All
right, let's get his badge info

25:09.608 --> 25:11.144
up there on the screen.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.578
SEMMLA (over monitor):
Okay. There it is.

25:12.611 --> 25:16.082
Studio audience and you folks
at home, cast your votes.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.217
Dude, I got to say,
this is creepy.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.986
I mean it.
This is creepy as hell.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.921
(music plays)

25:30.529 --> 25:32.331
CARRIS:
All right.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.300
Let's see where we're at.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.177
It's okay.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.279
He's got more shows to do.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.787
You think she'll help us?

25:53.820 --> 25:56.089
ALARA: They had to have a base
of operations somewhere.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.124
She's the only one who might
be able to give us a lead.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.198
LYSELLA:
There you go.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.100
Oh, hey, guys.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.302
I am so, so sorry
about what happened.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.270
Well, thank you.

26:11.304 --> 26:12.772
We're optimistic
that he'll be okay.

26:12.806 --> 26:14.040
Who?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.375
John. Our friend
who got arrested.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.377
You're kidding me, right?

26:18.411 --> 26:20.046
Oh, my...

26:20.079 --> 26:21.647
No, screw that guy.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.082
Why would you ever want
to talk to him again?

26:23.116 --> 26:24.217
I mean, he got
a million downvotes.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.952
Right, yes, and that's bad.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.453
LYSELLA:
I-I mean, it's like

26:27.486 --> 26:30.289
-you never really know somebody,
you know? -ALARA: Mm.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.792
I actually thought he was cute
when he first came in here.

26:32.826 --> 26:34.828
Ugh, God, that makes
my skin crawl.

26:34.861 --> 26:37.163
Mine, too.
Really, really gross guy.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.966
Listen, Lysella, about our
friends who got corrected...

26:39.999 --> 26:41.801
Oh, my God, that's right.

26:41.835 --> 26:44.971
Holy crap, you guys have had
a really bad month, huh?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.673
We were wondering if you might
know where they were based,

26:47.706 --> 26:50.143
like if they had
a residence nearby?

26:50.176 --> 26:52.578
Hey. Why are you wearing that?

26:52.611 --> 26:54.180
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.748
Take that neffolo off.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.350
I'm sorry, the what?

26:57.383 --> 26:58.617
You're not Kelvic.

26:58.651 --> 26:59.752
That's traditional
Kelvic headwear.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.421
It's not a hat.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.523
Oh, no.

27:04.557 --> 27:06.826
ALARA:
Uh, I...

27:06.860 --> 27:09.128
-I can't.
-What?

27:09.162 --> 27:11.931
I have the deepest respect
for your place of origin,

27:11.965 --> 27:13.532
but I can't take this off.

27:13.566 --> 27:17.270
You're literally pissing
on my heritage by wearing that.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.273
I have a really bad rash
under here.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.141
It's disgusting.
You'd throw up, so...

27:22.175 --> 27:23.676
I think you're lying.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.044
Prove it

27:25.078 --> 27:26.545
or they're all gonna upload.

27:26.579 --> 27:27.947
Uh, you know what?

27:27.981 --> 27:29.682
You are absolutely right.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.284
We're gonna go
and take it off right now.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.586
Come on, Alara.
We're very sorry.

27:36.990 --> 27:39.458
Claire, what am I gonna do?

27:39.492 --> 27:41.460
-Go on, take it off.
-What?

27:41.494 --> 27:42.461
Take it off.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.163
The seamstress is in the house.

27:44.197 --> 27:45.965
-What are you doing?
-I'm making you a wrap.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.733
Not super fashionable,
but it'll cover

27:47.766 --> 27:49.335
that washboard forehead
of yours.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.737
-Wow, full-service doctor.
-You know it.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.172
Hey, um, that guy's gone

27:53.206 --> 27:55.708
if you guys want to...

27:55.741 --> 27:58.444
New problem.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.189
-ALARA: No!
-CLAIRE: No!

28:10.223 --> 28:12.325
-No, no, no, no! It's okay.
-Come on. It's okay.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.327
-It's okay. You're fine.
-All right?

28:14.360 --> 28:15.561
You're okay.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.263
We're not gonna hurt you.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.332
What are you?

28:19.365 --> 28:24.037
We are two very nice people

28:24.070 --> 28:26.039
who are gonna buy you a drink.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.955
Feeling better?

28:41.988 --> 28:43.122
I-I just can't believe

28:43.156 --> 28:44.924
that this is actually happening.

28:44.958 --> 28:49.028
I mean, you guys really are
from another planet?

28:49.062 --> 28:51.264
Well, two different planets,
actually.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.798
Claire is from a place
called Earth

28:52.831 --> 28:54.800
and I'm from a planet
called Xelayan.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.736
So, can you guys,
like, do stuff?

28:57.770 --> 29:02.408
Like shoot lasers
out of your eyes or anything?

29:02.441 --> 29:04.110
I can do this.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.647
Oh, whoa.

29:08.681 --> 29:10.283
Lysella, we need your help.

29:10.316 --> 29:13.252
The two men you saw in the
pictures that we showed you,

29:13.286 --> 29:15.221
they're like us-- they came here
to study your planet.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.622
We need to find them.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.125
Wait, those guys
were aliens, too?

29:19.158 --> 29:21.294
Yes. Do you know
what happened to them?

29:21.327 --> 29:23.629
Uh, they were on a subtrain

29:23.662 --> 29:25.631
and there was a pregnant woman
standing behind them

29:25.664 --> 29:27.633
because all the seats
were taken.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.168
Somebody took a picture. Here.

29:29.202 --> 29:32.171
I'll show you.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.507
They didn't get up
and offer the seat.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.509
The picture was uploaded
to the Master Feed

29:36.542 --> 29:38.577
and then they got downvoted.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.679
It looks like
they just didn't see her.

29:40.713 --> 29:43.616
Doesn't matter.
The people decided.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.618
That was always Lewis.

29:45.651 --> 29:48.321
Nose buried so deep in his work,

29:48.354 --> 29:50.123
he never had a clue
what was going on around him.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.191
LYSELLA: But, uh,
there is something else.

29:52.225 --> 29:55.328
One of them tried to escape
before he was corrected.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.495
He got killed.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.466
-Which one?
-I don't remember.

30:00.499 --> 30:04.370
Lysella, where do they send
people who have been corrected?

30:04.403 --> 30:06.605
They send them home.

30:06.639 --> 30:09.475
I think your friends once told
me they lived on Kappala Street.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.270
These are Lewis's
research notes.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.045
Doctor.

30:46.079 --> 30:48.347
Lewis!

30:48.381 --> 30:51.050
Lewis, thank God.
Are you all right?

30:51.084 --> 30:53.719
I am well.

30:53.752 --> 30:56.655
Don't you recognize me?

30:56.689 --> 30:58.157
It's Claire.

30:58.191 --> 31:00.526
Of course. Claire.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.196
You look healthy and happy.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.166
CLAIRE:
Lewis, I need to know.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.701
What did they do to you?

31:08.734 --> 31:12.771
I did something terrible
and then I was corrected.

31:12.805 --> 31:14.373
I'm better now.

31:14.407 --> 31:18.944
I'm healthier and happier.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.813
I have to get him
back to the ship.

31:23.749 --> 31:28.187
-John, do you have any talents
I should know about? -What?

31:28.221 --> 31:29.755
Can you dance
or play an instrument?

31:29.788 --> 31:32.024
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

31:32.057 --> 31:34.560
Um, look, we're not doing
too well here.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.230
We should have a lot fewer
downvotes and we don't.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.732
But people tend
to be more sympathetic,

31:39.765 --> 31:42.368
more forgiving of a crime,
if the perpetrator has talent.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.070
That makes them more likable,
more relatable.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.072
Hmm. Uh, I can drink
an entire bottle of tequila

31:47.106 --> 31:48.541
and say the alphabet.

31:48.574 --> 31:52.578
Just go out there with a lot
of positive energy.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.581
Get the audience on your side.

31:56.982 --> 31:59.118
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

31:59.152 --> 32:00.986
My next guest is a guy

32:01.019 --> 32:04.157
you've all seen or heard about
on the Feed.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.058
His actions speak
for themselves.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.826
Here's John Lamarr.

32:07.860 --> 32:10.763
(audience booing)

32:10.796 --> 32:12.231
(laughing):
Hey, hey, hey.

32:12.265 --> 32:14.300
-(audience booing)
-(John laughs)

32:14.333 --> 32:16.835
All right. Okay.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.908
You know, I got to say,
I'm surprised by that entrance.

32:22.941 --> 32:23.976
You liked it?

32:24.009 --> 32:25.244
You're in a lot of trouble

32:25.278 --> 32:27.246
for doing something
extremely disrespectful

32:27.280 --> 32:29.114
and not only did you
dance out here

32:29.148 --> 32:31.016
acting like it's nothing,

32:31.049 --> 32:34.086
but you struck several members
of the audience.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.988
For God's sake, Willks, what
the hell are you trying to do?

32:36.021 --> 32:37.756
Hey, I'm giving
this my best shot here.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.993
Now, this job entails
a lot of guesswork.

32:42.628 --> 32:46.199
Lewis, is there anything you can
tell us about that planet

32:46.232 --> 32:48.267
that might help us repair
the damage they did to you?

32:48.301 --> 32:49.802
There is no damage.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.471
I am healthy and happy.

32:52.505 --> 32:54.273
But what about Tom?

32:54.307 --> 32:55.874
Lewis, they killed him.

32:55.908 --> 32:58.544
My God, his family.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.179
Please tell Tom's family

33:00.213 --> 33:03.148
I wish them great happiness
and good health.

33:03.182 --> 33:06.852
Captain, it's like
he's been lobotomized.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.120
There's nothing I can do.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.722
The brain damage is too severe.

33:09.755 --> 33:13.492
Sir, we can't let them
do this to John.

33:13.526 --> 33:16.862
HOST (over monitor): Okay,
it is voting time, audience,

33:16.895 --> 33:18.531
and you folks at home.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.132
Here we go.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.235
Do you believe John's apology?

33:22.268 --> 33:24.437
Sound off now.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.251
Damn it.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.253
Now what?

33:40.286 --> 33:41.920
Well, that's it.

33:41.954 --> 33:45.258
Now he goes back to detention to
wait for the final summary vote.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.725
And then?

33:46.759 --> 33:49.828
Well, if he stays
below ten million downvotes

33:49.862 --> 33:51.330
before the tour window elapses,

33:51.364 --> 33:53.432
he's fine.

33:53.466 --> 33:57.202
But, honestly, I've never seen
anyone above nine million

33:57.236 --> 33:59.538
at this stage
who came out uncorrected.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.608
I'm sorry, Kelly.

34:04.977 --> 34:06.345
Grayson to Orville.

34:06.379 --> 34:08.281
Mercer here. Go ahead.

34:08.314 --> 34:10.349
Captain, what's the latest
from Claire?

34:10.383 --> 34:11.917
She can't repair the damage.

34:11.950 --> 34:13.786
KELLY (over comm):
Then John is in big trouble.

34:15.087 --> 34:18.557
We need some kind
of an inside advantage.

34:18.591 --> 34:19.725
What can we do?

34:19.758 --> 34:20.859
The admiral said that

34:20.893 --> 34:22.595
we couldn't send anyone in,

34:22.628 --> 34:26.365
but he never said
we couldn't pull someone out.

34:26.399 --> 34:29.635
Claire, what's the name of your
little friend down there?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.169
Lysella.

34:33.171 --> 34:35.508
We're gonna bring her
aboard the Orville.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.270
Oh, my... God.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.414
It's incredible.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.816
It's so big.

35:17.850 --> 35:20.018
The Orville's only midsize.

35:20.052 --> 35:22.187
You should see
the heavy cruisers.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.331
I'll just hang onto that
until we take you home.

35:32.365 --> 35:36.301
But nobody's gonna believe me
if I don't have pictures.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.371
Exactly.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.392
We're sorry to turn your world
upside down like this,

35:59.425 --> 36:01.126
but we need your help.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.795
Believe me,
this is the coolest thing

36:02.828 --> 36:04.229
that has ever happened to me.

36:04.262 --> 36:06.999
What are they again?

36:07.032 --> 36:10.135
Commander Bortus is a member
of a species called Moclan.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.336
I am an artificial

36:11.370 --> 36:13.338
life-form
from a planet called Kaylon.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.140
Wow.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.675
Bortus, can you make a note?

36:16.709 --> 36:18.343
We should have, like,
pretzels and water and stuff

36:18.377 --> 36:19.812
on the table
when people come in here.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.315
-Noted, Captain.
I will not fail you. -Great.

36:23.348 --> 36:26.151
Lysella, what can you tell us
about your planet that might

36:26.184 --> 36:27.920
help us figure out
a way to save John?

36:27.953 --> 36:29.154
Your world is...

36:29.187 --> 36:31.557
hard to get a handle on.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.991
How so?

36:33.025 --> 36:35.694
Well, the voting and rating.

36:35.728 --> 36:38.330
Those badges--
you all wear them?

36:38.363 --> 36:39.898
Yeah. You get one
when you turn 18,

36:39.932 --> 36:42.334
and then, you wear it
for the rest of your life.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.169
It's how we can tell
who's good and who's bad.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.539
So this is
an absolute democracy?

36:46.572 --> 36:49.007
Yeah. How does your world work?

36:49.041 --> 36:51.877
We select representatives
who discuss issues

36:51.910 --> 36:53.178
and enact laws.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.347
But what about everybody else?

36:55.380 --> 36:57.082
Everybody deserves a voice.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.917
That's what we're taught.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.786
A voice should be earned,

37:00.819 --> 37:02.387
not given away.

37:02.421 --> 37:05.223
How do you know...

37:05.257 --> 37:06.892
what foods are healthiest
for your children,

37:06.925 --> 37:08.894
or what medicine to take
if you're sick?

37:08.927 --> 37:11.129
-We vote.
-ISAAC: I believe

37:11.163 --> 37:13.899
you are confusing opinion
with knowledge.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.802
I think what he's asking is,
with so many voices at once,

37:16.835 --> 37:18.637
how do you filter out the truth?

37:18.671 --> 37:21.440
Well, my dad always says,
"The majority are the truth."

37:21.474 --> 37:23.642
I mean, you always know
what the majority wants.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.243
That's what matters.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.946
Well, you always know
what the mob wants, too.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.649
And right now, the mob wants
to lobotomize my navigator.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.985
Now, there must be
some way to...

37:33.018 --> 37:35.454
influence the mass perception
before it's too late.

37:35.488 --> 37:38.824
Well... everybody reads
the Master Feed.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.425
What's the Master Feed?

37:40.459 --> 37:42.127
It's a continuously streaming
opinion feed.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.096
We saw them everywhere.

37:44.129 --> 37:48.166
Could this... Feed turn
the public tide in John's favor?

37:48.200 --> 37:51.837
Well, yeah,
but everybody uses the Feed.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.439
I mean, how are you gonna get
millions of people

37:54.473 --> 37:55.841
to change their minds?

37:55.874 --> 37:58.944
I believe I have a suggestion.

38:00.212 --> 38:02.214
(chiming)

38:24.870 --> 38:27.105
Oh, hell, no. Hell, no.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.974
-Y'all not putting me in that
thing! Get off me! -Hey.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.009
-Hey, take it easy!
-Hey! hey!

38:41.386 --> 38:43.121
Um, tell me they got this!

38:43.155 --> 38:46.291
-How much time?
-Final Vote begins

38:46.324 --> 38:47.926
in... seven minutes.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.064
Grayson to Orville.
We're running out of time.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.732
Stand by.
Isaac, what's your status?

38:53.766 --> 38:55.233
I have gained access

38:55.267 --> 38:57.235
-to the Master Feed.
-ED: All right, Lysella,

38:57.269 --> 38:59.838
what kind of stuff would
endear him to your people?

38:59.872 --> 39:03.175
Um,... you could say he supports
his grandmother financially.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.343
-Do it. -But make sure
you word it right.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.846
Like say,
"Oh, my God, I just found out

39:07.880 --> 39:09.982
John Lamarr supports
his 90-year-old grandmother."

39:10.015 --> 39:12.751
Flooding the Feed
with 20 million entries.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.252
How can you do that?

39:14.286 --> 39:17.255
-Babe. Spaceship.
-All right, what else?

39:17.289 --> 39:19.024
If he was an overweight kid,
that would help.

39:19.057 --> 39:22.527
Access childhood image of John.

39:22.561 --> 39:25.764
Ugh. Crap, that's no good.
Isaac, can you make him fatter?

39:25.798 --> 39:28.033
LYSELLA:
That's better.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.267
People will like him now.

39:29.301 --> 39:31.837
Flooding the Feed
with the image.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.339
The entries are spreading
and multiplying.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.841
People are sharing them.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.109
What if people try
to corroborate

39:37.142 --> 39:38.611
all this information?

39:38.644 --> 39:40.779
Don't worry. They won't.

39:40.813 --> 39:44.750
Final Vote has begun.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.318
(computer trilling)

39:58.163 --> 40:00.432
Ed, we're out of time.

40:00.465 --> 40:03.068
-What else?
We need something else! -Um...

40:05.137 --> 40:06.939
No, no, no, no, no, no. No!

40:06.972 --> 40:08.273
No. Come on! No!

40:08.306 --> 40:11.209
Tell them he has slain
many enemies in battle.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.911
Or you could just say
he's a veteran.

40:12.945 --> 40:14.579
What if he has a dog
named Chuckles?

40:14.613 --> 40:16.114
Yes, that's great.
People love those videos

40:16.148 --> 40:17.916
of soldiers reuniting
with their pets.

40:17.950 --> 40:21.153
Access military attire for the
planet and simulate the video.

40:23.856 --> 40:26.491
-(dog barks) -Oh, Chuckles.
Oh, Chuckles, come here!

40:26.524 --> 40:28.293
Yeah. Yeah!

40:28.326 --> 40:30.228
Oh, my God, Chuckles,

40:30.262 --> 40:32.264
I missed you so much!
I'm so happy

40:32.297 --> 40:34.299
to be reunited with you.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.835
Oh, Chuckles, I missed you
when I was at war.

40:36.869 --> 40:39.071
That's tuggin'
at these heartstrings.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.773
Flood the Feed with that.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.880
(computer dinging)

41:22.681 --> 41:26.018
I don't believe it.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.720
John, you won!

41:27.753 --> 41:29.354
You're damn right I won!

41:29.387 --> 41:32.357
Now get this crap off of me,
you crazy sons of bitches!

41:32.390 --> 41:34.026
According to the Feed,

41:34.059 --> 41:36.829
Lieutenant Lamarr
has escaped punishment.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.066
Come on, John.
Let's get you out of here.

41:46.371 --> 41:48.206
-Congratulations!
-Real quick,

41:48.240 --> 41:51.043
I just want to say,
all y'all can suck ass,

41:51.076 --> 41:53.211
and I'm a spaceman.

41:53.245 --> 41:55.080
I...

42:00.185 --> 42:02.988
Lysella, thank you.

42:03.021 --> 42:06.024
No. Thank you for...

42:06.058 --> 42:08.693
letting me see all of this.

42:08.727 --> 42:11.363
I just wish
I could tell somebody.

42:11.396 --> 42:13.431
Well, maybe all you need
to tell them is that

42:13.465 --> 42:15.968
their world can do better.

42:31.283 --> 42:33.752
(alarm beeping)

42:42.928 --> 42:44.930
(beeping stops)

42:47.332 --> 42:49.734
MAN (on TV): I think I speak for
all of our viewers when I say

42:49.768 --> 42:52.437
that what you have done is
shocking to say the least.

42:52.470 --> 42:55.373
But, of course,
that's for the people to decide.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.309
That's all the time
we have for today.

42:57.342 --> 43:00.779
Don't forget to cast your votes,
and we'll see you tomorrow.
