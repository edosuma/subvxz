WEBVTT

00:00.124 --> 00:02.564
Take care, Liz.
Yep.

00:04.604 --> 00:07.844
When I get out you are so dead.

00:07.924 --> 00:10.364
What if she asks me to hurt people?

00:10.484 --> 00:13.724
Then you gotta do it.
I've got a job for you, Maxie.

00:17.644 --> 00:21.284
Have I backed the wrong horse? No.

00:21.364 --> 00:24.444
You've got something there.

00:28.004 --> 00:31.324
Oh, it's a miracle pill. It stops
the blood. Makes it thicker.

00:31.404 --> 00:34.004
So the drugs stop the bleeding?

00:36.964 --> 00:41.484
Fuckin' bitch!
For Christ's sake, Fletch!

00:41.604 --> 00:44.804
You should be happy
you're leaving this place.

01:42.804 --> 01:48.724
Bea? Bea? Bea! Stay with me!

01:56.563 --> 01:58.123
Bea, you're in Medical, OK?

01:58.243 --> 02:01.004
Can you hear me, Bea? I'm just going
to assess your injuries, alright?

02:01.123 --> 02:02.724
Ambulance has been called?
Yes, Governor.

02:02.749 --> 02:05.203
Oxygen, please.
Keep pressure on her arm.

02:05.323 --> 02:12.163
Who did this to you?
Who was it? Bea?

02:12.243 --> 02:14.283
Who did this to you?

03:37.390 --> 03:39.070
I forgot how being pregnant
makes you fart.

03:39.190 --> 03:41.030
Jeez, I was going off
like a rocket last night.

03:41.110 --> 03:45.510
I'm farting and vomiting,
sometimes both at the same time.

03:45.630 --> 03:51.190
Hey Dor, I need you to call Toni
for me again. Sure. OK.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.470
Red.

04:01.990 --> 04:03.440
Oh, a spot at the big table, huh?

04:03.442 --> 04:04.630
Well Boomer's not using it.

04:13.830 --> 04:18.390
I heard why she got slotted.
Think I wouldn't find out?

04:18.399 --> 04:21.159
She came at me,
I defended myself.

04:21.278 --> 04:23.598
Why'd she come at you?
She lost her temper.

04:23.718 --> 04:25.798
You know what she was doing.
She was sorting out Liz.

04:25.823 --> 04:28.663
And you're
not gonna get in the way.

04:30.798 --> 04:34.718
No. Now what'd you say that made her
so upset?

04:34.838 --> 04:37.958
Does it matter?
Will when she gets out.

04:44.758 --> 04:48.278
I told her, 'Boomer, get off
the phone. Stop this shit with Liz.

04:48.398 --> 04:51.238
If you don't, I'll hurt you.'
And she says, 'Franky'll have

04:51.358 --> 04:54.638
something to say about that.' To
which I replied, 'I don't give a

04:54.758 --> 04:58.198
fuck what Franky says, because
Franky won't be running things

04:58.318 --> 05:02.038
around here for much longer anyway.'
Oh.

05:02.158 --> 05:04.878
I really needed her to get off
that phone.

05:08.118 --> 05:10.118
So you wanna take me now
that Boomer's in the slot?

05:10.143 --> 05:14.023
I don't want to do anything Franky.
It's all in your head.

05:24.438 --> 05:25.838
Hey sis, Bea wants to...

05:25.918 --> 05:27.678
Hey Toni, it's Bea.

05:27.798 --> 05:30.838
Yeah, I was just wondering if
you had that present for me yet.

05:33.278 --> 05:34.878
No, what do you mean?
It has to be today.

05:34.998 --> 05:37.358
I mean, you never said anything
about going away.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.918
Shit.

05:39.998 --> 05:41.078
Hey, listen.

05:41.198 --> 05:45.278
What you're going to do is you're
going to go to Standstead House.

05:45.358 --> 05:46.598
Do you know it?

05:46.718 --> 05:48.758
Yeah, good.
And I want you to give it to Liz.

05:48.878 --> 05:51.598
Yeah, there'll be more
in it for you.

05:53.478 --> 05:58.158
Yes, I am able to work
autonomously without supervision.

05:58.238 --> 06:01.158
Are you a team player? Yes.

06:01.557 --> 06:03.997
I love team environments.

06:04.078 --> 06:06.278
I spent seven years in one.

06:08.038 --> 06:12.038
Tell us about your
employment history.

06:12.118 --> 06:13.798
Yes, ah, I know it's been...

06:13.918 --> 06:18.318
well it's been eighteen-and-a-half
years since my last job.

06:18.398 --> 06:22.038
Ah, I stopped work to raise...

06:23.678 --> 06:25.958
my two beautiful children.

06:29.078 --> 06:31.278
Shit.

06:32.878 --> 06:34.398
What was that about?

06:36.158 --> 06:39.998
I need you to call Liz.
Why?

06:41.918 --> 06:44.878
Have you got a problem?
Ah, yeah I do.

06:44.958 --> 06:46.478
You know what?

06:46.598 --> 06:49.678
By the end of today, Franky'll be
gone and I'll be running things.

06:49.798 --> 06:52.438
So when I ask you to do
something, you don't ask why.

06:52.558 --> 06:57.478
You just do it, alright?
Now call Liz.

06:59.998 --> 07:03.998
You fuck up her parole,
and I'll never forgive you.

07:07.638 --> 07:09.318
Liz?
Yeah?

07:09.438 --> 07:11.638
Phone call!
Righto.

07:17.918 --> 07:19.838
Hello?
This is Elizabeth Birdsworth.

07:19.918 --> 07:22.558
Hey Liz, it's me. How are ya?

07:22.678 --> 07:26.078
Bea! Oh, God, how are ya?
Hey, guess what?

07:26.198 --> 07:30.238
Guess what? I saw Sophie, my
daughter, and she knew who I was.

07:30.318 --> 07:31.998
Yeah, she is so beautiful...

07:32.118 --> 07:35.998
Hey, um, look I've got something
coming to you this afternoon.

07:36.118 --> 07:38.958
It's a package.
What?

07:39.078 --> 07:42.278
Yeah, it's ah, it's gonna be there
this afternoon.

07:42.398 --> 07:44.398
I was just wondering if
you were going to be there.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.638
A package?
What... what kind of package?

07:46.718 --> 07:49.358
It's a surprise, right?

07:49.478 --> 07:51.678
And you're not allowed to
open it until I tell you.

07:51.758 --> 07:54.838
So you gonna be there?

07:54.958 --> 07:57.198
Ah, yeah.
Good, cos um,

07:57.318 --> 08:00.918
it's really special and I don't
want it getting pinched.

08:02.638 --> 08:05.878
Bea, this isn't gonna... this isn't
gonna get me into trouble, is it?

08:05.998 --> 08:10.718
Nah. Hey?
No way.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.758
Just, just...
just tell me, you gonna be there?

08:13.878 --> 08:18.918
Ah, yeah. Yeah, OK.
Good.

08:20.878 --> 08:22.518
Love, is everything alright?

08:22.598 --> 08:25.078
Yeah. Yeah, it's real good.

08:25.158 --> 08:27.718
Look, I gotta fly, Liz.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.558
We'll talk soon.

08:44.878 --> 08:46.438
Oh, shit.

08:46.518 --> 08:48.398
What?

08:48.518 --> 08:50.838
Not talking to you.
Oh, I thought you were

08:50.958 --> 08:52.718
saying shit about all
the stupid shit I done.

08:52.838 --> 08:56.158
I say shit all the fuckin' time
about all the stupid shit I done.

08:56.238 --> 08:58.158
Jesus, Kelly.

08:58.278 --> 09:00.078
I thought that was my
name there for a while.

09:00.158 --> 09:02.678
Jesus Kelly. What the fuck.

09:02.758 --> 09:04.318
Sign. Yep.

09:04.438 --> 09:08.518
Part of it's I think
I got an intellectual disability.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.358
All processed?
Yes.

09:24.198 --> 09:26.078
Do you know her?

09:26.158 --> 09:28.998
Bryant. Hey. The Governor.

09:32.398 --> 09:33.838
Do you know her?

09:33.958 --> 09:36.918
No.
You sure about that?

09:36.998 --> 09:39.038
Yep.

09:46.358 --> 09:48.078
What's going on?
What do you know?

09:48.198 --> 09:50.158
What?
Red.

09:50.238 --> 09:52.838
Bea Smith.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.758
She making a move on Franky, hmm?
I haven't heard anything.

09:55.878 --> 10:00.198
Well if you do hear anything
and you don't tell me,

10:00.318 --> 10:03.078
I can put a knife across that
innocent little face of yours.

10:03.198 --> 10:06.958
Or we could be friends.
What do you reckon?

10:07.038 --> 10:08.758
Franky, don't.

10:08.878 --> 10:11.438
Maxie!
Mmm?

10:11.518 --> 10:13.278
Your tits are getting bigger.

10:13.398 --> 10:16.518
Yours aren't.
Come on.

10:16.598 --> 10:18.158
Let's go to work.

10:18.238 --> 10:20.958
Ladies, this is Kelly Bryant.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.558
Hi Kelly. I'm Jess.
Bryant, you're in 43.

10:25.678 --> 10:29.438
It's the third one down.
Go make yourself comfortable.

10:29.558 --> 10:34.358
Keep going. I heard a nasty rumour
that today's your last day.

10:34.438 --> 10:35.638
That's correct.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.198
Yeah, that's it.

10:37.318 --> 10:39.798
Listen, I need you to
keep an eye on her for me.

10:39.918 --> 10:42.798
OK? She's, um...
What's wrong with her?

10:42.918 --> 10:46.638
Well she's nervy about something.
Anything out of the ordinary,

10:46.758 --> 10:48.518
you let me know, yeah?
Happy to help.

10:48.598 --> 10:50.438
Thanks Jess.

10:50.518 --> 10:52.518
Hey Mr Fletcher?

10:52.598 --> 10:54.318
Have you started celebrating early?

10:54.398 --> 10:56.238
What do you mean?

10:56.318 --> 10:58.638
I'd have a mint if I was you.

11:11.398 --> 11:13.838
I'm gonna count the minutes
till I'm out of this place.

11:13.958 --> 11:19.238
Yeah, so am I.
She's cancer, Will.

11:19.998 --> 11:21.838
She got me, and she'll get you.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.038
So you can be a
self-righteous fuck all you want,

11:24.118 --> 11:26.558
but I'm your future, mate.

11:44.958 --> 11:46.838
There you go.

11:55.958 --> 11:57.158
I'm gonna need that shiv.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.798
Red! More.

12:14.078 --> 12:15.478
Hang around for a minute.

12:23.198 --> 12:24.878
Ferguson's using you to get at me.

12:26.758 --> 12:29.798
Now it wouldn't be the first time
a screw's played that game.

12:29.878 --> 12:31.718
But a Governor?

12:31.798 --> 12:34.238
That's something else.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.518
I never gave Simmo that gear.

12:38.638 --> 12:42.718
I never even had a chance to cut it
before the screws confiscated it.

12:42.798 --> 12:45.038
It was Ferguson.

12:46.838 --> 12:49.598
She gave Simmo a hotshot.

12:49.678 --> 12:51.198
I don't know why,

12:51.318 --> 12:55.718
but that's what happened. So don't
say I didn't warn you about her.

12:55.838 --> 12:59.838
Smith. You're wanted
in the Governor's office.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.598
I rest my case.
Now.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.758
Morning tea with the Governor!

13:04.838 --> 13:08.158
How cosy! Send her our love, Red.

13:08.278 --> 13:09.958
Will do.
Yeah, that's enough Doyle.

13:10.038 --> 13:11.638
Get back to work, all of you.

13:14.980 --> 13:17.263
Yes?

13:17.343 --> 13:19.025
Bea Smith for you, Governor.

13:19.106 --> 13:21.068
Thank you, Ms Bennett.

13:26.516 --> 13:27.958
You've got to stop calling me to
your office. It doesn't look good.

13:28.038 --> 13:29.039
Take a seat.

13:33.445 --> 13:36.570
OK. Doyle.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.933
What's the hold up?

13:39.053 --> 13:41.857
You did engineer Boomer Jenkins
being slotted, yeah?

13:41.977 --> 13:44.340
Well with Boomer put away,
Doyle's all the weaker for it.

13:44.460 --> 13:47.184
You've had three days now
and you haven't done anything.

13:47.264 --> 13:50.068
When the time's right, I will...

13:50.148 --> 13:52.071
Is that all?

13:52.151 --> 13:54.514
You're not going to do it, are you?

13:54.594 --> 13:57.598
I said, in my own time.

14:05.529 --> 14:12.219
Give me my airing! Ooh!

14:12.299 --> 14:15.022
Puppies, puppies, puppies.

14:15.103 --> 14:22.461
Get me my fucking airing! Ooh!

14:25.277 --> 14:27.039
Hey Boomer.
Hello.

14:27.119 --> 14:30.924
When can I have my airing?

14:31.044 --> 14:34.209
Because I was meant to
have it hours ago, eh.

14:34.289 --> 14:36.171
And I've been trying...

14:36.292 --> 14:38.455
I've been
trying real hard to be good.

14:38.575 --> 14:40.257
Yeah. You know, thinking about
the puppies,

14:40.282 --> 14:42.300
and their
soft, beautiful shiny coats.

14:42.420 --> 14:46.386
But I think I gotta get out...
Shh shh shh shh shh shh.

14:50.591 --> 14:53.634
That Bea Smith, she got you
pretty upset the other evening

14:53.634 --> 14:57.745
at the phones, yeah?
Yeah.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.391
What'd she say to you?

15:05.245 --> 15:06.928
It's alright, Booms.
You can talk to me.

15:20.948 --> 15:23.832
Still got
Mr Fletcher's wankerchief?

15:23.912 --> 15:25.074
No, I gave it back to him.

15:25.154 --> 15:26.395
I seen the way he looks at you.

15:26.476 --> 15:30.161
I bet he goes home at night
and has a big old pull

15:30.281 --> 15:32.484
thinking about his little sweety
Jess.

15:32.604 --> 15:40.295
Ohh, fuck yeah, oh, I love ya. I'll
stick it up ya fuckin' bum! Booms!

15:45.301 --> 15:49.107
How the fuck did you get out?
Governor took pity on me, eh.

15:55.836 --> 15:59.161
Yeah!

16:00.019 --> 16:03.103
See, Red? Boomer's out of the slot.

16:05.987 --> 16:07.229
Hello, Bea.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.172
Open your mouth.
Tongue up. Sideways. Other way.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.617
That'll do. Doreen.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.599
Mm?
This is Kelly.

16:29.805 --> 16:32.328
Doreen's a peer worker.
Hey. How are ya?

16:32.495 --> 16:34.698
You're Aboriginal.

16:34.778 --> 16:36.461
You got a problem with that?

16:36.581 --> 16:39.765
Nah.
I'll be in H2 if you ever need me.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.204
And if I'm not there,
I'll be in the laundry.

16:42.284 --> 16:43.806
Derek, take over for me?

16:43.886 --> 16:46.650
Kelly, this way.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.492
So you know the routine
about the count yet?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.135
You muster at your cell door.

16:50.255 --> 16:52.578
Or if you're working
you get counted there.

16:52.697 --> 16:55.901
I imagine it would have been
the same at Blackmoor. Yeah,

16:56.023 --> 16:58.826
I looked up your history. You were
there the same time as Ferguson.

16:58.947 --> 17:01.350
Twenty odd years ago she was a
guard there. You remember her,

17:01.390 --> 17:04.154
don't you Kelly, huh?
No.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.676
She's got a way about her
that's hard to forget.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.046
Listen Kelly, I can help you, OK?
I can.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.849
But you need to tell me
what happened.

17:17.612 --> 17:22.419
I'm gonna finish up my time,
then I'm gone.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.063
I can find the way from here.

17:26.665 --> 17:29.148
Hello, Mr Fletcher.

17:29.228 --> 17:31.151
Jess.

17:31.271 --> 17:34.355
I'm really gonna miss
having you around here.

17:34.475 --> 17:37.399
Well you're part of a
very exclusive club.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.402
You took my advice.

17:39.522 --> 17:41.165
Huh?
You smell good enough to eat.

17:43.328 --> 17:45.971
On your way, you.

17:54.102 --> 17:56.506
Alright, first of all
the issue of accrued leave.

17:56.626 --> 18:01.272
Governor, you had quite an effect
on the new inmate this morning.

18:01.392 --> 18:03.676
Did I?
Kelly Bryant.

18:05.438 --> 18:08.442
Yeah, you can't shut her up.
She's talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

18:08.562 --> 18:12.448
The Governor walks past, stops
talking. Can't talk, won't talk.

18:12.568 --> 18:15.692
I thought she was having a stroke.
It was quite an effect you had.

18:15.772 --> 18:17.895
Thank you, Mr Fletcher. Fascinating.

18:18.015 --> 18:21.180
She seems to know you from
your time at Blackmoor.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.983
Did she serve time at Blackmoor?
Same time you were there.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.188
Well,
I must have made an impression then.

18:27.308 --> 18:29.271
I reckon you must have
scared the shit out of her.

18:29.296 --> 18:30.833
Mr Fletcher...
I aim to scare the shit

18:30.913 --> 18:33.156
out of everyone, Mr Fletcher.

18:34.758 --> 18:36.401
Now to our business, hmm?

18:36.481 --> 18:38.323
Accrued leave.

18:41.848 --> 18:44.412
Look at her. It's like nothing ever
fuckin' happened.

18:44.492 --> 18:49.458
Here you go. The garden boxes.

18:55.226 --> 18:58.831
I wanna be the one, eh.
You know the rules.

18:58.952 --> 19:01.395
Just gotta be me and her.
Yeah I know the rules, alright?

19:01.475 --> 19:03.157
I get the rules, but I been waiting.

19:03.237 --> 19:05.681
Booms, you'll get your turn.

19:05.801 --> 19:07.684
Alright ladies, all good.
Off to lunch.

19:11.409 --> 19:13.572
Hey, I got a job for ya.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.335
Follow Maxine.

19:50.542 --> 19:54.989
Hey, Red... What's going on?

19:55.109 --> 19:58.553
Franky had Maxine
totally sussed, hey.

19:58.634 --> 20:01.357
I could have got you a shiv.

20:01.437 --> 20:03.160
All you had to do was ask.

20:03.280 --> 20:08.207
You gonna try and stick that in
Franky, were ya, huh? You're fucked!

20:08.327 --> 20:11.171
Let's go talk.
I don't think so.

20:13.013 --> 20:15.737
Yeah, copy that.
Screws.

20:15.817 --> 20:17.900
I'm gonna see you after lunch.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.472
Is everything alright here, ladies?

20:26.552 --> 20:28.114
Yeah. We're good.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.636
Yeah, it's all good.

20:34.323 --> 20:36.005
See ya, Red.

20:54.390 --> 20:55.632
Clear.

21:08.770 --> 21:10.733
Something's building.

21:10.813 --> 21:13.136
Over there. Taking bets.

21:13.216 --> 21:16.140
Ah, eight says it's Franky.

21:16.220 --> 21:17.742
Yeah, well I'll have three.

21:17.822 --> 21:19.865
What's the wager, ladies?

21:19.945 --> 21:22.389
Ah, no wager, Mr Jackson.

21:22.509 --> 21:24.031
Betting's against
regulations, Pierson.

21:24.056 --> 21:26.354
Yeah, I'm not betting.
What's that then?

21:26.474 --> 21:30.520
Cigarettes. Well I suggest you pick
them up before I confiscate them.

21:30.640 --> 21:38.170
Yep. OK.
What?

21:38.971 --> 21:40.894
There she is.

21:40.974 --> 21:42.576
Saunders.

21:42.697 --> 21:46.021
I'm going to enjoy watching you
turn back into a man.

21:46.141 --> 21:48.585
Well I would have anyway with
the stuff you were giving me.

21:48.665 --> 21:49.746
What was it, chalk dust?

21:49.866 --> 21:50.828
Nah.
What was it?

21:50.948 --> 21:53.271
Franky was trying to
help you, you fuckin' man.

21:53.391 --> 21:55.394
Oh, darling, this one
doesn't care about anyone.

21:55.474 --> 21:57.156
You know what?

21:57.277 --> 21:58.959
Why don't you leave
this to the real women?

21:58.984 --> 22:03.725
This is between me and Bea.
And if you get involved in any way,

22:03.846 --> 22:06.850
your tits won't have a chance to
drop naturally. I'll cut 'em off.

22:06.970 --> 22:10.895
I'm terrified.
You should be.

22:25.395 --> 22:27.598
Hello, Mr Fletcher.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.240
Hey, Miss Warner.

22:29.321 --> 22:31.163
How's your last day going?

22:31.243 --> 22:32.685
Going.

22:32.765 --> 22:37.732
No good? Sad to leave us, I bet.

22:38.653 --> 22:40.937
Yeah. I think I'm really
gonna miss the place.

22:41.057 --> 22:43.700
It's funny that.
Anyone in particular?

22:45.262 --> 22:48.307
Well I'm really gonna miss having
you around to make me feel safe.

22:50.790 --> 22:56.157
I've got something for you.
A goodbye present.

22:56.238 --> 22:58.441
I can't accept gifts.

22:58.561 --> 23:01.124
Rules.
Yeah, rules.

23:02.166 --> 23:03.768
Well maybe you can
give me something.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.778
A mint.
Oh! A mint.

23:10.898 --> 23:12.260
Yeah.
Mm.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.581
What'd you think I was saying?

23:20.511 --> 23:21.993
I'm gonna go clean the showers.

24:05.252 --> 24:06.694
Fuck...

24:39.540 --> 24:40.621
Oh, yeah!
Shh shh shh.

24:40.701 --> 24:44.506
Yeah!

25:12.230 --> 25:13.192
Yeah, roger that.

25:27.762 --> 25:31.968
By all means, feel free
to give Mr Fletcher a send-off.

25:32.048 --> 25:33.690
Just do not do it here.

25:33.770 --> 25:36.374
That would be highly irregular.

25:36.383 --> 25:38.906
How has Jenkins settled back in?
Oh, I think everything's OK.

25:38.926 --> 25:41.195
No trouble as far as I know.
Keep me updated.

25:41.195 --> 25:42.537
Will do, Governor.
Thank you.

25:42.558 --> 25:44.839
Sierra One, Sierra Six?
Sierra Six.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.346
Yes, H4 is clear. You can
return the women to their unit.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.988
Copy that, Sierra One.

26:28.808 --> 26:30.009
Come inside me.

26:30.223 --> 26:32.506
What'd you say?

26:32.587 --> 26:33.628
What?

26:33.707 --> 26:35.229
Yeah. Yeah.

26:35.350 --> 26:36.872
No, no, no, no, no. No, I can't.
Yeah.

26:36.992 --> 26:39.716
No I can't. I can't do this.
Why?

26:39.836 --> 26:41.198
I can't...
What's wrong?

26:41.278 --> 26:44.002
I can't, I'm sorry. It's not right.

26:44.122 --> 26:47.727
What's wrong?
It's just wrong...

26:52.011 --> 26:53.653
Where's my swipe card?

26:53.733 --> 26:55.936
- What?
- My swipe card.

27:02.465 --> 27:05.229
Where the fuck is it? I had it
when I came in. What's going on?

27:05.309 --> 27:06.911
Where's my fucking card?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.122
You. You haven't got it, have you?

27:15.202 --> 27:17.445
No.

27:19.849 --> 27:21.211
Oh, fuck.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.176
Give it to me. I don't have it.

27:25.296 --> 27:28.007
What is this, some kind of set up?
What... What is all this?

27:28.007 --> 27:30.210
Fuckin' just give me my card back.
Give me my fuckin'...

27:30.303 --> 27:34.274
just give me my fuckin' card!
You set me up you fuckin' slut!

27:34.275 --> 27:35.716
Now give it to me.

27:35.796 --> 27:38.079
You're hurting me, Mr Fletcher!

27:38.159 --> 27:39.801
Give me my fuckin' swipe card!

27:39.881 --> 27:46.731
Give it to me! Fuck! No!

27:48.894 --> 27:55.182
Why? You!

28:35.647 --> 28:37.486
Mr Fletcher?

28:41.180 --> 28:45.170
Sierra 5, this is Sierra 7.

28:45.171 --> 28:47.769
Are you OK?

28:47.850 --> 28:50.568
Mr Fletcher?

28:50.679 --> 28:52.677
Sierra 5, this is Sierra 7,
do you copy?

28:52.757 --> 28:54.595
Just say you lost it.

28:56.833 --> 28:58.432
It must happen all the time.

28:58.512 --> 29:01.189
Sierra 5, do you copy?

29:05.465 --> 29:07.024
You need help, Mr Fletcher.

29:14.897 --> 29:16.536
Sierra 5, do you copy?

29:38.956 --> 29:40.635
What have you done?

29:44.272 --> 29:46.190
I don't think
you're in a position to ask.

29:53.383 --> 29:55.621
Sierra 5, copy.
Thanks.

29:55.701 --> 29:57.859
He's fucked up.

31:02.803 --> 31:04.841
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary today?

31:07.239 --> 31:09.477
With the women?
With the women?

31:09.557 --> 31:12.354
Yeah.

31:12.434 --> 31:13.873
Yeah.

31:15.591 --> 31:18.030
OK, like what?

31:19.828 --> 31:21.986
Ah, nothing really.
Like a tension?

31:22.066 --> 31:24.303
Yeah.

31:24.384 --> 31:27.222
Something is going on.

31:27.342 --> 31:31.058
Yeah, I had the same
feeling Tuesday.

31:31.138 --> 31:33.097
Nothing happened on Tuesday.

31:36.254 --> 31:37.692
Yeah.

31:43.007 --> 31:48.043
I am not ordering a lockdown
on the basis of a feeling.

31:48.163 --> 31:50.281
The last time it was like this,
there was a riot.

31:50.361 --> 31:51.640
I know these women.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.479
Well if you had actionable
intelligence

31:53.598 --> 31:56.116
then of course I'd consider it,
but all you have is speculation.

31:56.141 --> 31:57.555
It's not enough.

31:57.634 --> 31:59.314
Yes, Governor.

31:59.433 --> 32:01.432
Thank you,
for bringing it to my attention.

32:03.190 --> 32:06.986
This inmate, Kelly Bryant.

32:07.066 --> 32:09.904
I'd like to talk to her. Discreetly.

33:01.499 --> 33:03.577
Hello, Bryant.

33:03.657 --> 33:04.776
Go on.

33:48.258 --> 33:49.657
Hey Mr Bakula?

33:49.777 --> 33:51.855
Could you open the chemicals
cupboard for me, please?

34:00.727 --> 34:02.525
Fuck it.

34:02.646 --> 34:06.122
Reckon you're gonna need bolt
cutters to get in there, eh?

34:09.918 --> 34:12.036
No fighting while I'm away, ladies.

34:53.041 --> 34:55.559
Get her, Franky! Get her! Get her!

35:00.115 --> 35:01.833
Get her Franky!

35:36.922 --> 35:37.882
You are so fucked now!

35:50.951 --> 35:52.549
Get her!

36:04.139 --> 36:06.058
Boomer, you can't. You can't.

36:18.127 --> 36:25.280
Are we done? Are we done?
Tell them... Fuckin' tell them.

36:27.558 --> 36:30.836
It's Bea's. She won.

36:51.017 --> 36:52.217
Fuckin' what?

37:38.450 --> 37:39.769
Bea!

37:39.888 --> 37:42.646
Bea, Bea come on, stay with me!
Come on!

37:48.569 --> 37:50.327
Do you think she's
stable enough for transit?

37:50.694 --> 37:54.011
She's coming in and out,
but she'll be fine.

38:00.005 --> 38:02.823
Yeah, she was prepared for it.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.324
Ah, Governor, the ambulance
is here. You go with her.

38:06.957 --> 38:09.994
Not her wrists. It's regulation.

38:12.731 --> 38:14.969
OK. Hey, the ambulance
is here, Bea.

38:15.089 --> 38:16.808
We're going to take
you to the hospital, OK?

38:16.833 --> 38:18.671
Let's go.

38:30.236 --> 38:32.954
Her pulse is 90 over 40.

38:33.034 --> 38:35.311
It's weak and thready.

38:35.431 --> 38:37.030
On three.
That's her medical file.

38:37.150 --> 38:38.908
Ah, they're defensive wounds.
It was a fight.

38:38.933 --> 38:40.954
Call up to surgery.
I want her in there right now.

38:41.106 --> 38:42.585
We'll need a central venous line.

38:49.116 --> 38:50.075
Here.

38:58.979 --> 39:00.418
It's from the mail room.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.536
I want a
full audit of the mail room.

39:02.617 --> 39:04.175
Find out how they got in there.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.693
Of course.

39:10.209 --> 39:11.807
Why was Kelly Bryant
sent to isolation?

39:11.888 --> 39:14.606
What?

39:14.685 --> 39:16.683
Governor's orders.

39:19.961 --> 39:21.559
I'm staying back.

39:21.639 --> 39:23.677
Until Will gets back from hospital.

39:23.797 --> 39:25.715
I thought you couldn't
wait to get out of here.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.234
I could do with the overtime.

39:29.672 --> 39:31.390
Surgery went well,

39:31.510 --> 39:34.028
but I'd like to keep her here
under observation for a while.

39:34.148 --> 39:36.386
There's an abnormally high
blood clotting factor I'd like

39:36.411 --> 39:38.305
to investigate further.

39:38.384 --> 39:40.023
But she will be OK? Oh, yes.

39:40.102 --> 39:42.261
It's probably what saved her life.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.779
Thanks, doc.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.289
You're in the hospital. You're OK.

39:57.848 --> 40:00.925
So, Franky got you pretty good, eh?

40:04.201 --> 40:05.640
Not talking?

40:08.238 --> 40:10.117
Well you can't blame me for trying.

40:10.197 --> 40:12.754
Glad you're OK.

40:12.834 --> 40:19.029
I'm so thirsty. I'd love a lemonade.

40:19.109 --> 40:20.348
I'll see what I can do.

40:34.655 --> 40:37.492
I need medical attention.

40:37.612 --> 40:42.169
You're not dying. First you tell me
what happened.

40:42.288 --> 40:46.724
Your crazy bitch came at me with
a pair of prison issue boxcutters.

40:46.804 --> 40:48.363
I wonder where she got those from?

40:48.482 --> 40:51.441
Well you tell me,
it was your weapon.

40:51.521 --> 40:53.759
And you're going to answer for it.

40:53.838 --> 40:55.357
Attempted murder.

40:55.437 --> 40:58.155
Unless of course she dies.

40:58.274 --> 41:02.071
I've got about six witnesses to say
those injuries were self-inflicted.

41:02.631 --> 41:03.669
Nice try.

41:03.790 --> 41:09.464
You know what? She could have cut me
right there, and she didn't.

41:09.544 --> 41:11.423
Got a knife, bang.

41:11.542 --> 41:16.578
Right up there.
She did it to herself.

41:38.279 --> 41:41.356
G'day, you've reached Will Jackson.
Please leave a message.

41:48.151 --> 41:49.630
Governor?
Are you with Smith?

41:49.710 --> 41:51.308
No, I'm just outside the ward.

41:51.428 --> 41:53.626
Get back to her now.
Those injuries were self-inflicted.

41:53.666 --> 41:55.943
What? Do not leave her side.
You understand me?

42:02.618 --> 42:05.176
Oh, shit.

42:05.255 --> 42:08.253
Where is she? The patient!

43:05.243 --> 43:07.761
Oh, fuck.
