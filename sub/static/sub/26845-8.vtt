04:58.345 --> 05:00.595
- Woman: Hello?
- Hey, Mom.

05:00.678 --> 05:03.345
- Jess?
- Yeah.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.886
I'm sorry I'm calling so late.

05:04.970 --> 05:05.970
It's OK.

05:06.053 --> 05:08.429
Is everything all right?

05:08.512 --> 05:09.595
Yeah.

05:10.803 --> 05:13.429
Yeah, I'm fine, I just, um...

05:13.512 --> 05:15.262
I don't even know why I called.

05:15.345 --> 05:19.636
I think I'm just overworked
and overtired.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.262
Probably from all the travel.

05:22.345 --> 05:24.470
I get it, sweetheart.

05:24.554 --> 05:26.387
You know,
I never told you this,

05:26.470 --> 05:30.095
but I had terrible anxiety
when I was your age.

05:30.178 --> 05:32.636
Sometimes it was so bad,
I mean,

05:32.720 --> 05:36.137
I couldn't even get out of bed
and face the day.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.845
I hope that's not
happening to you.

05:38.928 --> 05:42.262
Are you...
are you sure you're OK?

05:44.137 --> 05:47.512
Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

05:47.595 --> 05:50.429
I keep having this bad dream.

05:52.512 --> 05:54.803
Would you like
to talk about it?

05:58.262 --> 06:01.262
Jess? Are you there?

06:02.720 --> 06:05.053
Yeah. Yeah. Um--

06:05.137 --> 06:09.220
I say that because
sometimes nightmares
are just nightmares.

06:09.304 --> 06:12.470
But sometimes
they feel so real

06:12.554 --> 06:15.178
they spill over
into the daytime.

06:15.262 --> 06:17.095
You don't want that.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.636
You know, I can come over
if you want.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.636
Mom, I'm like
five hours away.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.678
So? ( laughs )

06:24.761 --> 06:27.470
So I'm-- I'm fine.
( chuckles )

06:27.595 --> 06:31.304
I think I just needed to hear
a comforting voice.

06:32.761 --> 06:36.345
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.304
- Bye, Mom.
- Hey, wait.

06:39.928 --> 06:41.970
What?

06:42.053 --> 06:43.678
I'm just getting this...

06:43.761 --> 06:46.053
bad energy from
your side of the phone,

06:46.137 --> 06:48.845
like there's something...

06:48.928 --> 06:51.803
lurking around you
or something.

06:51.886 --> 06:54.178
Something not quite right.

06:54.262 --> 06:57.262
Something that might
be after you, Jess.

06:57.345 --> 06:59.970
Mom, if you're trying
to be funny, this is not--

07:00.053 --> 07:01.304
This is no joke!

07:01.387 --> 07:02.886
You could be
in real danger, baby!

07:02.970 --> 07:04.803
You need to get yourself
out of that place!

07:04.886 --> 07:06.178
Mom, calm down--

07:06.262 --> 07:07.512
Just get out
of that motel, Jess!

07:07.595 --> 07:09.345
- Mom! Mom!
- Get out of there!

07:09.429 --> 07:11.886
- Right now!
- Mom, I'm stuck!

07:11.970 --> 07:13.429
They're right there,
Jessie, run!

07:13.512 --> 07:14.928
Mom, I'm stuck!

07:15.012 --> 07:16.304
What is wrong with you? Run!

07:16.387 --> 07:18.970
Mom, help! Mom!

07:19.053 --> 07:21.429
( gasping )

07:21.512 --> 07:23.803
( panting )

07:30.012 --> 07:31.345
Fuck this.

07:55.178 --> 07:57.178
( unzips bag )

07:57.262 --> 07:59.304
( hissing )

07:59.387 --> 08:03.262
( gasps ) Fuck! You!

08:06.095 --> 08:08.554
- ( rattling doorknob )
- What?

08:10.220 --> 08:11.345
Fuck.

08:14.429 --> 08:15.387
( grunts )

08:17.429 --> 08:19.178
( panting )

08:23.095 --> 08:25.220
No. No.

08:27.554 --> 08:28.886
Fuck!

08:32.429 --> 08:33.761
( door slams )

08:35.761 --> 08:37.053
Mom.

08:37.137 --> 08:39.678
Jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.

08:39.761 --> 08:42.886
Sweetie, you called me
and I was worried
about you.

08:45.095 --> 08:47.928
What are you still doing here?
I told you to get out.

08:48.012 --> 08:50.220
Mom, there's no door.

08:54.262 --> 08:56.470
- Of course there is.
- Yeah, well,

08:56.554 --> 08:58.761
we can't get out.
It-- It's locked.

08:58.845 --> 09:01.304
Of course  it is.

09:01.387 --> 09:03.178
Why didn't you
try the key?

09:03.262 --> 09:05.429
The key?

09:05.512 --> 09:08.178
Yes. Jess, are you OK?

09:08.262 --> 09:09.845
No.

09:09.928 --> 09:11.928
No, wait. The--

09:12.012 --> 09:13.761
The key is how you get in.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.554
You don't open a door
from the inside with a key.

09:16.636 --> 09:19.512
What are you talking about,
Jess? I've got the key
right here.

09:19.595 --> 09:21.053
It was on the table.

09:21.137 --> 09:23.512
( laughs )

09:23.595 --> 09:26.137
Come on.
Let's get out of this place.

09:30.345 --> 09:33.053
- ( rattling lock )
- See?

09:33.137 --> 09:34.845
Come on!

09:34.928 --> 09:36.636
Jess, let's go!

09:37.928 --> 09:39.928
Jess.

09:42.053 --> 09:42.970
Mom, look out!

09:47.554 --> 09:49.678
No, plea-- Please!

09:50.970 --> 09:54.345
- ( screams )
- ( panting loudly )

10:16.178 --> 10:17.803
( dials )

10:17.886 --> 10:20.970
( line out ringing )

10:21.053 --> 10:23.387
Woman:
911. What's your emergency?

10:23.470 --> 10:26.429
Hi. I'm-- I'm at the motel
off the parkway.

10:26.512 --> 10:28.262
Can you please send someone?

10:28.345 --> 10:30.262
What's your emergency?

10:30.345 --> 10:34.095
I think that there's someone...
or something... in my room

10:34.178 --> 10:35.636
that's trying to harm me.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.761
- Room number?
- 104.

10:38.845 --> 10:41.886
Please stay on the line
while I dispatch someone
to your room.

10:41.970 --> 10:44.803
( breathing heavily )

10:44.886 --> 10:46.803
The only other thing is that--

10:46.886 --> 10:48.220
Yes?

10:51.220 --> 10:53.636
I keep having this dream, and...

10:53.720 --> 10:58.387
and I-- I honestly don't know
what's real and what's not.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.720
I don't even know if this
is really happening right now.

11:03.803 --> 11:06.803
I'm a 911 operator
and this is definitely real.

11:06.886 --> 11:08.470
I've dispatched
a black and white

11:08.554 --> 11:10.761
and they should be there
in under seven minutes.

11:10.845 --> 11:13.886
Until then, can you tell
if you're in any
immediate danger?

11:15.595 --> 11:17.470
- I don't think so.
- And do you know

11:17.554 --> 11:20.012
the whereabouts
of your assailant?

11:20.095 --> 11:22.512
No, I-- I don't see him
right now.

11:22.595 --> 11:25.803
Good. What about
the man with the knife?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.262
No, I can't see--

11:29.845 --> 11:31.345
How did you know about him?

11:31.429 --> 11:33.970
I didn't say anything about
a man with a knife.

11:34.053 --> 11:36.970
( 911 operator laughing )

11:45.429 --> 11:46.761
( hissing )

11:48.137 --> 11:50.012
( hissing continues )

11:50.095 --> 11:51.262
( Jess screaming )

11:51.345 --> 11:52.761
( whimpering )

12:05.886 --> 12:08.178

12:19.137 --> 12:21.429

12:23.345 --> 12:24.304

12:25.470 --> 12:26.636

12:28.137 --> 12:29.595
( yawns )

12:34.304 --> 12:35.636
( panting )

12:48.803 --> 12:50.053
Look out!

12:51.178 --> 12:53.012
( yelps )

12:54.761 --> 12:57.678
- No!
- ( slicing )

13:26.387 --> 13:28.595
'Sup, dude.

13:30.803 --> 13:33.387
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You can put that thing down.

13:36.262 --> 13:37.928
What are you so afraid of?

13:39.053 --> 13:40.220
This?

13:40.304 --> 13:43.636
This is all you.
You know that, right?

13:43.720 --> 13:46.970
I mean,
you're in control here.

13:47.053 --> 13:52.137
You brought us all
into this hotel room with you...

13:52.220 --> 13:54.595
I think because
you wanted  us all here.

13:54.678 --> 13:58.012
- I want to go home.
- Really?

13:58.095 --> 13:59.803
Yes.

13:59.886 --> 14:01.178
Then go home.

14:01.262 --> 14:02.595
Just go.

14:02.678 --> 14:04.554
I can't. They're all out there.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.845
Well, they're out there
because you put  them out there.

14:06.928 --> 14:09.304
If you want 'em to go away,
just make 'em go away.

14:09.387 --> 14:11.512
I tried that. It doesn't work.

14:11.595 --> 14:13.512
Did you really try?

14:13.595 --> 14:17.470
'Cause I think
you actually want us here.

14:17.554 --> 14:21.137
I think you brought us here
because you need  us here.

14:24.137 --> 14:26.512
Why would I need you here?

14:26.595 --> 14:32.095
Because without us,
then you'd have to face
what's out there.

14:34.345 --> 14:36.845
In the real world.

14:36.928 --> 14:40.845
In the truly terrifying
daylight.

14:40.928 --> 14:44.803
It's much easier to face us
than to face yourself.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.262
I like it in here.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.053
In the warm bath, with you,

14:51.137 --> 14:53.554
all of our friends.

14:53.636 --> 14:55.512
In the cover of night.

14:58.636 --> 15:01.053
You're just trying to scare me.

15:01.137 --> 15:04.137
- Is that so?
- Uh-huh.

15:05.970 --> 15:10.470
Because I think...
you're already scared.

15:15.053 --> 15:18.137
No. I'm not gonna fall for that.
I'm getting the fuck outta here.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.012
Well, good luck to you then.

15:34.387 --> 15:36.178
Allow me.

15:49.178 --> 15:51.012
( panting )

15:52.095 --> 15:54.845

16:24.345 --> 16:27.387
You gotta get out.
Get out of here!

16:27.470 --> 16:29.803
I'm trying, Mom.

16:29.886 --> 16:32.095
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

16:32.178 --> 16:35.470
You stupid dumb
fucking bitch!

16:35.554 --> 16:38.803
Run! Get the fuck out!

16:38.886 --> 16:41.720
- Run! Run!
- Let go, Mom!

16:41.803 --> 16:45.886
Get the fuck out! Now! Now!

Get the fuck out.

Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

16:54.595 --> 16:56.178
( demonic-sounding )
Get the fuck out.

16:56.262 --> 17:00.137
Are you sure that's
what you really want? Hmm?

17:03.095 --> 17:05.053
( whooshing sound )

17:11.262 --> 17:12.761
You're free to go.

17:21.761 --> 17:24.595
Oh, not so sure now.

17:24.678 --> 17:27.220
- Fuck you.
- OK, sure, if you want.

17:27.304 --> 17:29.095
I'll make room in the tub.
It's nice and warm in there.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.012
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you. Jinx.

17:31.095 --> 17:32.886
You already said that.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.761
( panting )

17:42.512 --> 17:44.970
So, what's it
gonna be, Jess?

17:47.220 --> 17:50.304
( laughing )

17:50.387 --> 17:53.636
Don't you want to stay in here
with us?

17:53.720 --> 17:55.761
( laughing )

17:55.845 --> 17:59.095
I mean, can you really
face yourself in the daylight?

17:59.178 --> 18:00.970
( laughing )

18:02.636 --> 18:05.012
( softly )
I'm not afraid.

No!

18:13.429 --> 18:15.178
Run!

18:15.262 --> 18:17.636
I'm not scared.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.595
Run, Jess!
