01:19.126 --> 01:22.580
Hey, easy on the shell, bud.

01:22.610 --> 01:25.071
I just had it waxed.

01:27.477 --> 01:30.049
Almost there.

01:38.167 --> 01:41.206
Well, master, how'd I do ?

01:41.207 --> 01:43.510
3 minutes, 26 seconds.

01:43.511 --> 01:46.016
Not your best time, Michelangelo.

01:46.017 --> 01:48.588
Come on !
It's not my fault.

01:48.589 --> 01:51.595
Donatello put some new traps
in the tunnel.

01:51.596 --> 01:54.601
Of course. I got to keep you guys
on your toes.

01:54.602 --> 01:56.105
Your turn, Raphael.

01:56.106 --> 01:59.947
Remember the importance
of energy and concentration.

01:59.948 --> 02:01.717
It's hard to get too worked up

02:01.718 --> 02:04.122
Over a stupid obstacle course,
you know ?

02:04.123 --> 02:05.960
Well, just do what I do...

02:05.961 --> 02:09.199
Pretend there's a pizza
waiting at the finish line.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.240
I'll give you a better incentive...
Shredder.

02:12.241 --> 02:14.244
Leonardo is right.

02:14.245 --> 02:16.816
All indications are that
he's preparing to return

02:16.817 --> 02:18.586
with the Technodrome.

02:18.587 --> 02:21.627
What is it this time, Shredder ?

02:21.628 --> 02:23.764
I have a new plan, Krang,

02:23.765 --> 02:26.938
But i'll need a canister of
the mutagen to implement it.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.644
That chemical is very rare.

02:29.645 --> 02:32.817
Why should I waste 
more of it on you ?

02:32.818 --> 02:36.826
I wish to create more mutants to use
against the turtles.

02:36.827 --> 02:39.231
That'll be nice.

02:39.232 --> 02:41.736
Someone new to talk to.

02:41.737 --> 02:44.175
Yeah, our own kind.

02:44.176 --> 02:47.182
For once you've come up

02:47.183 --> 02:49.688
with a halfway decent plan.

02:49.689 --> 02:51.925
There's one problem, though.

02:51.926 --> 02:55.801
We're presently experiencing
an ion storm.

02:55.802 --> 02:58.138
It may interferelem, with the portal.

02:58.139 --> 03:00.310
We must risk it !

03:00.311 --> 03:04.219
Prepare to receive
the mutagen canister.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.657
And, turtles, wherever you are,

03:06.658 --> 03:09.096
prepare to meet your end !

03:10.165 --> 03:13.605
Oh, we could've gone to Hawaii,

03:13.606 --> 03:15.844
But, no, you said Florida was cheaper.

03:15.845 --> 03:19.118
Look what I found.
Can I keep them, mom, huh ?

03:22.626 --> 03:25.331
Put those disgusting things down !

03:25.332 --> 03:27.168
You don't know where
they've been !

03:27.169 --> 03:29.507
Sure I do.
In the swamp.

03:29.508 --> 03:31.511
You heard me now.
Put them back this instant !

03:31.512 --> 03:33.849
Mom !

03:42.870 --> 03:44.372
So long, fellas.

03:44.373 --> 03:47.312
We could have had
a great life together.

03:48.883 --> 03:51.621
Let's go to a hotel.

03:51.622 --> 03:54.561
This place is crawling
with creatures.

03:54.562 --> 03:56.699
They're only frogs.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.305
They're not the creatures
from the maroon lagoon.

04:04.951 --> 04:08.725
Wow ! Neat-o !

04:13.871 --> 04:16.242
The canister is where ?

04:16.243 --> 04:19.649
A section of earth known as Florida...

04:19.649 --> 04:21.653
The okefenokee swamp.

04:21.654 --> 04:27.165
I told you the ion storm
may interfere with the portal.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.338
I'm going to Florida
to find the mutagen.

04:30.339 --> 04:31.842
Oh, great !

04:31.843 --> 04:34.347
I'll go pack my surfboard.

04:34.348 --> 04:36.752
Not you, you mutant moron.

04:36.753 --> 04:38.690
I'm going by myself.

04:38.691 --> 04:40.694
Dressed like that ?

04:40.695 --> 04:42.198
This holographic projector

04:42.199 --> 04:44.636
Will take care of everything.

04:46.475 --> 04:50.114
Wow.
Me next, boss.

04:50.115 --> 04:53.255
No, stupid.
You two will stay

04:53.256 --> 04:54.992
and keep the turtles occupied

04:54.993 --> 04:57.263
while I'm gone.
Understood ?

04:57.264 --> 04:59.935
You bet. It'll be a pleasure.

05:02.342 --> 05:04.779
Come on, April, admit it.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.851
You do know the turtles.

05:06.852 --> 05:08.922
You found me out, Irma.

05:08.923 --> 05:11.361
I do know them.
Now are you happy ?

05:11.362 --> 05:13.365
Well, why should I be happy ?

05:13.366 --> 05:14.935
You're the one who knows them.

05:14.936 --> 05:16.605
I don't believe it !

05:16.606 --> 05:17.607
What ?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.611
Nothing.
I've got to go now.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.383
My... my car's double-parked.

05:21.384 --> 05:24.890
Wait ! You don't have a car.

05:24.891 --> 05:27.796
I thought you guys would
like to know about this.

05:27.797 --> 05:31.404
"Froglike monsters
seen in Florida swamp."

05:31.405 --> 05:34.945
I wonder if they might be
mutants like us.

05:34.946 --> 05:37.985
Perhaps we should investigate.

05:37.986 --> 05:41.593
You mean go to Florida ?
Far out !

05:41.594 --> 05:45.167
The surfing there is totally tubuloso !

05:45.168 --> 05:48.641
I think now might be a bad time.
Look at this !

05:48.642 --> 05:52.617
And I repeat... two delinquents are 
on a rampage in times square.

05:52.618 --> 05:56.191
One wears a rhinoceros mask,
the other, a wart hog mask.

05:56.192 --> 05:58.195
It's Rock-steady and Bebop !

05:58.196 --> 06:00.300
I wonder why the temper tantrum.

06:00.301 --> 06:03.239
Beats me.
Maybe they passed a mirror

06:03.240 --> 06:05.211
and saw what they look like, huh ?

06:05.212 --> 06:06.780
Let's go, turtles !

06:06.781 --> 06:08.283
Wait for me !

06:08.284 --> 06:10.789
I'm not missing this story !

06:10.790 --> 06:12.826
According to Krang's coordinates,

06:12.827 --> 06:15.533
the canister landed right around here.

06:15.534 --> 06:18.172
Here it is !

06:18.173 --> 06:20.678
Blast ! It's empty.

06:23.351 --> 06:25.554
4 overgrown frogs ?

06:25.555 --> 06:28.728
So this is my army of mutants ?

06:28.729 --> 06:32.302
The mutagen should have given you
the ability to speak.

06:32.303 --> 06:34.206
Who are you ?

06:34.207 --> 06:36.211
My name is Shredder,

06:36.212 --> 06:39.317
and I love all living things.

06:39.318 --> 06:41.622
You sound like a nice person.

06:41.623 --> 06:43.961
I am.

06:43.962 --> 06:45.565
And if you come with me,

06:45.566 --> 06:50.141
I'll show you wonders
you've never dreamed of.

06:50.142 --> 06:51.410
Sounds good to us.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.915
Splendid !

06:53.916 --> 06:57.356
Hold still.
This won't hurt a bit.

06:58.427 --> 07:00.497
Oh, boy ! Clothes !

07:00.498 --> 07:03.604
He's telling the truth.
He is a nice person.

07:03.605 --> 07:06.810
Now come. We have a great battle
to fight...

07:06.811 --> 07:10.184
against the evil mutant turtles.

07:10.185 --> 07:14.694
Wow. Now, this is what I call fun.

07:17.468 --> 07:20.707
And it's about to turn into more fun.

07:21.877 --> 07:24.816
All right ! 

07:24.817 --> 07:27.656
It's turtle trashing time !

07:27.657 --> 07:31.564
Remember, the bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

07:31.565 --> 07:34.637
Ready or not, here I come !

07:38.313 --> 07:41.252
So much for a frontal assault.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.189
Turtles, fight with honor.

07:43.190 --> 07:47.232
Come on ! I'll make
turtle soup out of youse.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.271
Excuse me. Yeah, boss ?

07:50.272 --> 07:51.608
Come back to the hideout,
both of you.

07:51.609 --> 07:54.113
I have what I was looking for.

07:54.114 --> 07:57.621
Boss, we was just getting warmed up.

07:57.622 --> 08:00.560
Now, you cretin !

08:00.561 --> 08:04.969
Oh, playtime's over.
The boss wants us.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.813
After them, turt...

08:12.086 --> 08:14.256
We'll never catch them now.

08:14.257 --> 08:17.664
I get the feeling that all of this was
just to distract us...

08:17.665 --> 08:19.100
But from what ?

08:19.101 --> 08:21.940
Don't worry, Leonardo.
I'm sure we'll find out.

08:21.941 --> 08:24.947
Whether we want to or not.

08:24.948 --> 08:27.786
You wanted to see us, boss ?

08:27.787 --> 08:30.892
Yes. I'd like you to meet your 
new allies

08:30.893 --> 08:33.297
in our battle against the turtles.

08:33.298 --> 08:35.803
These frogs have sworn to aid me

08:35.804 --> 08:38.342
in the destruction of our enemies.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.994
Frogs ?
Frogs ?

08:46.995 --> 08:49.800
As Splinter has done with the turtles,

08:49.801 --> 08:53.608
I have named them after
personal heroes of my own.

08:53.609 --> 08:55.712
Attila the frog.

08:55.713 --> 08:57.550
Genghis frog.

08:57.551 --> 09:00.390
Rasputin, the mad frog.

09:00.391 --> 09:03.630
And Napoleon Bonafrog.

09:03.631 --> 09:07.705
Boss, the turtles are trained ninjas.

09:07.706 --> 09:10.277
They'll mop up the floor 
with these wimps.

09:10.278 --> 09:12.549
Not to worry.

09:12.550 --> 09:16.190
I, the greatest martial arts
warrior of them all,

09:16.191 --> 09:18.362
have personally trained them.

09:18.363 --> 09:19.431
Show him, Napoleon.

09:19.432 --> 09:21.334
Whatever you say master.

09:28.885 --> 09:32.459
They might work out at that.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.434
Well, my turtles,

09:36.435 --> 09:39.240
has there been any sign of activity
from Shredder ?

09:39.241 --> 09:42.747
Nada. Zilch.
Meganegatory.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.752
In other words, nothing.

09:44.753 --> 09:47.992
This silence is most strange.

09:47.993 --> 09:50.264
Quick, guys, turn on the news !

09:50.265 --> 09:51.333
What's up, April ?

09:51.334 --> 09:53.438
You'll see.
And it's not good !

09:53.439 --> 09:57.012
This midtown bank was just
robbed by four creatures

09:57.013 --> 10:00.086
which employees described
as big green things

10:00.087 --> 10:02.290
like giant turtles.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.359
Turtles ?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.797
Chill out, man.
I want to hear this.

10:05.798 --> 10:07.802
What are your comments,
mr. mayor ?

10:07.803 --> 10:11.377
These turtles have terrorized
the city long enough.

10:11.378 --> 10:15.218
I'm ordering a special antiturtle 
squad to deal with this.

10:15.219 --> 10:18.725
Captain Hoffman here
will be in charge.

10:18.726 --> 10:21.599
Don't worry, mr. mayor.
We'll apprehend these criminals.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.570
You have my word on it.

10:23.571 --> 10:27.244
Dudes !
We're being framed !

10:27.245 --> 10:30.351
I suspect that Shredder
is somehow behind this.

10:30.352 --> 10:32.890
And I suspect you're right, master.

10:32.891 --> 10:34.860
Guys, we've gotta find
those mock turtles

10:34.861 --> 10:37.299
and give them what for.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.540
Splendid work, frogs.

10:40.541 --> 10:43.914
This first test of your skills has
gone swimmingly.

10:43.915 --> 10:46.620
Well, sir, swimming's
what we do best.

10:46.621 --> 10:49.392
Are we ready to take over
the whole city now ?

10:49.393 --> 10:51.631
Not quite.
We'll need more help.

10:51.632 --> 10:53.968
What now, Shredder ?

10:53.969 --> 10:57.476
Most of the mutagen was lost
when the canister fell.

10:57.477 --> 11:01.986
I'll need more if I'm to create
my army of mutants.

11:01.987 --> 11:06.094
Unfortunately, what i sent you
was the last of it.

11:06.095 --> 11:09.235
But i can tell you how to make more.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.509
Now, pay attention.

11:12.510 --> 11:16.016
So, like, well, how do
we find these dudes ?

11:16.017 --> 11:19.357
If we go to the scene of the crime,
maybe we'll find a clue.

11:19.358 --> 11:22.698
All right, turtles, freeze in your tracks !

11:22.699 --> 11:24.968
Time to do the turtle trot !

11:24.969 --> 11:27.742
Hasta lumbago, dudes !

11:33.723 --> 11:37.296
Master Shredder says we have to 
steal a list of chemicals from here.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.999
Isn't stealing bad ?

11:39.000 --> 11:42.173
I think so, but master Shredder
knows best.

11:42.174 --> 11:44.746
Being a mutant sure is confusing.

11:50.258 --> 11:52.763
Leonardo here.

11:52.764 --> 11:54.199
We just got another bulletin,
guys.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.470
Those unknown mutants
have broken into

11:56.471 --> 11:58.107
the mallory chemical plant.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.944
What could they want there ?

11:59.945 --> 12:03.653
Maybe Shredder's looking for a 
new metal polish for his face.

12:03.654 --> 12:07.428
Let's go. This is
the fastest way there.

12:10.001 --> 12:13.307
Dexonine and flouchist.

12:13.308 --> 12:15.411
Ok. We got what we came for.

12:15.412 --> 12:17.750
And you're gonna get more
than you bargained for !

12:18.986 --> 12:23.729
All right ! Let's see what
you creepolas look like !

12:26.470 --> 12:28.206
Hold them off, Rasputin !

12:34.220 --> 12:37.125
Whoa, that was some bright move !

12:37.126 --> 12:39.330
Come on. We can't let them get away !

12:39.331 --> 12:43.105
Total bummer.
They got away.

12:43.106 --> 12:45.611
I'm insulted.
How could anyone mistake

12:45.612 --> 12:47.781
those things for turtles ?

12:47.782 --> 12:49.785
We've got more serious problems.

12:49.786 --> 12:52.692
Those chemicals they stole are 
components of the mutagen

12:52.693 --> 12:55.632
that Shredder used to create
Rocksteady and Bebop.

12:55.633 --> 12:58.437
Well, that means that now Shredder
can make more mutants.

12:58.438 --> 13:00.309
Not yet.
He still needs

13:00.310 --> 13:03.315
another chemical called nyotrinaline
to make it work.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.219
It's extremely rare.

13:06.957 --> 13:08.393
April here.

13:08.394 --> 13:10.263
We need you to check the database

13:10.264 --> 13:12.902
and find out where a supply of 
nyotrinaline is available.

13:12.903 --> 13:14.907
Hang on a sec.

13:16.745 --> 13:18.748
Ok, i've got it.

13:18.749 --> 13:21.154
A shipment of the stuff is
arriving by armored truck

13:21.155 --> 13:23.593
the argus chemical supply warehouse.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.198
Great.
Thanks, April.

13:26.199 --> 13:28.737
Was that the turtles
you were talking to ?

13:28.738 --> 13:30.441
Talking to turtles ?

13:30.442 --> 13:32.846
Irma, you've been working too hard.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.783
You ought to take a vacation.

13:34.784 --> 13:37.623
Right. In a nice, cool sewer.

13:37.624 --> 13:41.398
April, the mayor's just ordered out
a new antiturtle squad.

13:41.399 --> 13:43.135
I want you to cover this.

13:43.136 --> 13:45.139
I'm on my way, Bern.

13:45.140 --> 13:47.143
More turtles ?
Can I come ?

13:47.144 --> 13:48.647
No !
No !

13:48.648 --> 13:50.083
Just asking.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.328
All right, now mix the two
chemicals carefully.

13:55.329 --> 13:56.597
Splendid.

13:56.598 --> 14:01.341
Now all it needs is
a pinch of nyotrinaline.

14:01.342 --> 14:04.380
Nyotrinaline ?
You didn't mention that.

14:04.381 --> 14:07.922
I thought i'd save it for a surprise

14:07.923 --> 14:10.628
to keep you on your toes.

14:10.629 --> 14:14.469
Krang, you are unspeakably cruel.

14:14.470 --> 14:17.643
Thank you.
You'll find a shipment

14:17.644 --> 14:21.652
arriving at the argus
chemical supply warehouse.

14:21.653 --> 14:25.159
You heard him.
Get that nyotrinaline now !

14:25.160 --> 14:29.167
But, master shredder,
What if we run into
The turtles again ?

14:29.168 --> 14:31.539
Must i tell you
Everything ?

14:31.540 --> 14:33.678
Destroy them !
They are evil !

14:33.679 --> 14:36.182
But what if
We talk to them ?

14:36.183 --> 14:38.354
You know,
Reason with them ?

14:38.355 --> 14:41.361
Trust me,
My innocent little frogs.

14:41.362 --> 14:44.701
Would this face lie ?

14:44.702 --> 14:46.539
Now get me that chemical !

14:51.049 --> 14:53.587
This is the antiturtle
Attack squad.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.691
Captain hoffman,
Just how do you intend

14:55.692 --> 14:57.495
To find
These mutant turtles ?

14:57.496 --> 15:00.502
This tracking device is
Tuned to their biorhythms.

15:00.503 --> 15:03.008
We'll find them
No matter where they hide !

15:03.009 --> 15:04.277
Good luck, captain.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.248
You'll need it.

15:08.955 --> 15:12.361
We're very close.
Turn right here !

15:12.362 --> 15:13.931
There's the nyotrinaline
Shipment.

15:13.932 --> 15:16.369
Are you sure the frogs
Will try for it ?

15:16.370 --> 15:17.706
No doubt about it.

15:17.707 --> 15:19.945
Shredder can't formulate
The mutagen without it.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.389
What in blazes ?

15:27.328 --> 15:29.565
Looks like
You were right,
Donatello.

15:29.566 --> 15:30.901
Check it out.

15:30.902 --> 15:33.540
Here w

15:33.541 --> 15:35.378
We got company.

15:38.652 --> 15:40.154
Give up, you guys,

15:40.155 --> 15:43.161
Or it'll be sauteed
Frog legs for everybody.

15:43.162 --> 15:45.834
All of you give up ! Now !

15:45.835 --> 15:47.905
What's that thing ?

15:47.906 --> 15:51.012
Don't ask me !
I'm from out of town !

15:55.355 --> 15:59.362
Hey, that thing just put
Those frogs on ice.

15:59.363 --> 16:02.837
Yeah, and it looks
Like we're next !

16:07.983 --> 16:09.986
Don't look now, dudes,

16:09.987 --> 16:12.959
But we're about to be
Flash-frozen !

16:12.960 --> 16:15.699
Not if i can help it !

16:21.211 --> 16:22.613
Look out !

16:26.022 --> 16:28.325
The hatch is jammed !

16:28.326 --> 16:30.597
Help me get
This blasted thing open !

16:30.598 --> 16:32.601
Time to make
Turtle tracks.

16:32.602 --> 16:35.107
Really !
Let's haul shell, dudes.

16:35.108 --> 16:36.677
Hold on, fellas.

16:36.678 --> 16:38.714
We can't leave
The frogs like that.

16:38.715 --> 16:41.688
Maybe you haven't been
Keeping up on current
Events, leonardo.

16:41.689 --> 16:44.127
They aren't exactly
On our side.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.133
Even so,
They are mutants,
Just like us.

16:47.134 --> 16:49.905
We can't let
That hoffman guy
Capture them.

16:49.906 --> 16:52.645
Leonardo's right.
We got to save them.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.321
Right !
And at warp speed.

17:00.763 --> 17:02.366
Stop them !

17:04.337 --> 17:06.273
Thanks !
We needed that.

17:06.276 --> 17:10.851
You escaped this time,
But i'll get you yet !

17:10.852 --> 17:13.589
So that's the story,
Master splinter.

17:13.590 --> 17:16.329
Yeah. At least we kept
Them from getting
The nyotrinaline.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.099
But what do we do
With these frogs ?

17:18.101 --> 17:19.670
We can't keep them
Frozen forever.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.741
If we wish
To win them over,

17:21.742 --> 17:23.545
We must show them
Trust.

17:23.546 --> 17:25.782
As always,
You are right.

17:25.784 --> 17:28.122
We'll melt the ice
And set them free.

17:28.123 --> 17:30.259
But what if
They attack us again ?

17:30.260 --> 17:32.397
We'll just have to
Take that chance.

17:37.008 --> 17:38.410
What's going on ?

17:38.411 --> 17:40.081
Yeah !
Where are we ?

17:40.082 --> 17:42.686
You're in the sewers,
And this is our home.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.592
Yeah. Welcome
To turtle turf.

17:45.593 --> 17:48.533
I fear
We've been captured.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.338
Yeah ! Well, at least
We'll go down fighting.

17:52.776 --> 17:54.244
Stop, everyone !

17:54.245 --> 17:56.550
There will be
No violence.

17:56.551 --> 17:58.955
Turtles,
Lay down your weapons.

17:58.956 --> 18:01.460
You are free to go,
Fellow mutants.

18:01.461 --> 18:03.464
I'm so confused.

18:03.465 --> 18:06.972
Why, master shredder said
You and the turtles were evil.

18:06.973 --> 18:09.979
I suggest you trust
Your animal instincts.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.916
We trusted shredder.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.822
But now
We can see that
He's just using us.

18:14.823 --> 18:17.829
Then maybe it's time
You started using him.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.903
I have a plan.
Listen...

18:22.306 --> 18:24.777
We're real sorry,
Master shredder.

18:24.778 --> 18:26.983
The turtles got
The nyotrinaline shipment.

18:26.984 --> 18:28.485
You mutant maggots !

18:28.486 --> 18:30.557
When i think of all
I've done for you--

18:30.558 --> 18:31.959
Brought you
Out of the swamps,

18:31.960 --> 18:33.363
Taught you
All you know !

18:33.364 --> 18:35.400
Oh, but all is not lost,
Master !

18:35.401 --> 18:37.538
You see, we heard
The turtles talking.

18:37.539 --> 18:40.378
Yeah ! They're gonna
Hide the chemical !

18:40.379 --> 18:43.150
In stonewall prison--
Where you can't get it.

18:43.151 --> 18:45.857
Stonewall prison.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.665
I remember that joint.
I did time there once.

18:49.666 --> 18:51.836
Yeah, me, too.

18:51.837 --> 18:54.174
But it's been
Closed for years.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.678
Better still.

18:55.679 --> 18:58.183
Then let's get there
Immediately.

18:58.184 --> 19:01.524
This old place sure
Brings back memories.

19:01.525 --> 19:06.100
Never mind that, you fool.
Just find that chemical.

19:06.101 --> 19:09.274
I hope those frogs
Didn't decide to
Double-cross us.

19:09.275 --> 19:11.311
If we want them to trust us,

19:11.312 --> 19:13.216
We have to trust them.

19:13.217 --> 19:16.055
Well, here it comes--
The moment of truth.

19:16.056 --> 19:19.061
They hid the chemicals
In here, master shredder.

19:19.062 --> 19:21.600
Excellent !
You've done well, frogs.

19:23.606 --> 19:25.108
Greetings, shredhead !

19:25.109 --> 19:28.215
You traitorous frogs !
You set me up !

19:28.216 --> 19:29.818
That's right, tinface !

19:29.819 --> 19:32.290
And now you're
Taking the fall.

19:32.291 --> 19:34.294
Now, where'd i learn
To say stuff like that ?

19:37.736 --> 19:39.807
They're in here all right.

19:39.808 --> 19:41.109
Let's go, men !

19:41.110 --> 19:43.113
It's the

19:43.114 --> 19:47.122
Farewell, shellbacks !

19:47.123 --> 19:50.463
They may get us,
But they'll also get you !

19:50.464 --> 19:52.600
Not if we look
Like one of them.

19:54.473 --> 19:57.678
Sayonara,
You mutated meddlers.

19:57.679 --> 20:01.019
Time to make
Ourselves real scarce.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.556
Does that mean run ?

20:02.557 --> 20:04.661
You frogs
Catch on real fast.

20:08.169 --> 20:10.339
There they go !
Open fire !

20:10.340 --> 20:13.346
We got to find
The sewer lines that
Connect to the prison.

20:13.347 --> 20:15.918
This mutant gas
Will stop them.

20:20.529 --> 20:22.532
Ooh, what is that ?

20:22.533 --> 20:25.472
Some kind
Of knockout gas.

20:28.045 --> 20:30.048
The prison
Laundry room !

20:30.049 --> 20:32.454
There's got to be
A sewer under here !

20:32.455 --> 20:34.959
Ooh, can't keep
My eyes open.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.465
Gas...putting
Me to sleep.

20:37.466 --> 20:39.970
Hang on, all of you.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.809
Rasputin,
Use one of your
Explosive arrows.

20:53.033 --> 20:57.041
Blast ! The mayor's not
Going to like this.

20:58.411 --> 20:59.780
Ok, everything clear ?

20:59.781 --> 21:01.884
Now, you'll follow
The sewers to the caves,

21:01.885 --> 21:03.454
Then to the old
Underground railroad

21:03.455 --> 21:05.358
Which leads straight
To the okefenokee.

21:05.359 --> 21:07.463
Oh, it'll be good
To get home.

21:07.464 --> 21:09.868
Life's so much better in the swamp.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.373
Thanks for coming over to our side.

21:12.374 --> 21:16.048
Hey, thanks for showing us
which one was the right side.

21:16.049 --> 21:19.623
Wait a sec, dudes !
I almost forgot.

21:19.624 --> 21:21.727
This ought to tide you guys over

21:21.728 --> 21:23.732
till you get back to bug city.

21:23.733 --> 21:27.573
Pizza ! 
Thanks, but no thanks.

21:27.574 --> 21:30.245
We hate pizza !

21:30.246 --> 21:34.254
Would you believe it ?
They don't like pizza.

21:34.255 --> 21:38.363
Yeah. Some mutants are just 
plain weird, you know ?
