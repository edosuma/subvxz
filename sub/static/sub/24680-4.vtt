In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.941 --> 00:13.038
the worst criminal offenders are 
pursued by the detectives

00:13.038 --> 00:14.907
of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.907 --> 00:17.085
These are their stories.

00:19.326 --> 00:21.325
I hope that you don't mind, but I just...

00:21.325 --> 00:22.677
Here you are, ladies.

00:22.677 --> 00:25.212
Ohh! Sorry.
Let me just wipe that off.

00:25.212 --> 00:28.665
Isobel, don't think about it for a second.
I'm happy to do it.

00:28.665 --> 00:30.078
Thanks, Frieda.

00:32.959 --> 00:35.634
I didn't know where the money was going. 
It's incredible.

00:35.634 --> 00:37.027
My own employees.

00:37.027 --> 00:39.811
We have procedures
that'll put a stop to that overnight.

00:39.811 --> 00:40.914
Excuse me.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.599
Frieda, I'm sure it's nothing.

00:46.599 --> 00:48.263
- Thank you.
- I'll make some calls.

00:48.263 --> 00:50.585
I'm sorry, Earl. I didn't realize 
you had somebody with you.

00:50.585 --> 00:53.302
Mr. Bolivar is here anytime you're ready.

00:53.302 --> 00:55.722
I'm ready now, Michael. We're done.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.833
My partner'll be right with us.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.404
A little to your right.

01:00.404 --> 01:01.743
Head up.

01:01.743 --> 01:03.374
Happy face.

01:03.374 --> 01:04.429
Bye, Rozlyn.

01:04.429 --> 01:05.754
See you tomorrow.

01:05.754 --> 01:08.224
You should get your card in a week or so.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.713
Everything okay?

01:14.713 --> 01:18.768
Um, I, uh, left my Walkman in my locker.

01:18.768 --> 01:20.850
It's on your waistband.

01:22.571 --> 01:25.612
So as soon as she's unpacked,
we'll take her out to dinner.

01:25.612 --> 01:26.983
And, Frieda, don't forget:

01:26.983 --> 01:30.693
Traffic is bad to the airport this time of day.

01:31.853 --> 01:33.873
Bye, sweets.

01:33.873 --> 01:35.569
Uh, Nelson,

01:35.569 --> 01:38.932
there is a car coming to pick me up.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.389
Could you tell the driver to wait?

01:41.389 --> 01:43.101
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

01:43.101 --> 01:44.698
Come. Come, come.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.858
Starlight to win. Okay.

01:50.858 --> 01:52.875
In the... Oh. Damn it.

02:12.092 --> 02:13.249
Why aren't you upstairs?

02:13.249 --> 02:16.179
I have been waiting here for over an hour.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.902
You said Frieda was supposed 
to pick me up at the airport.

02:18.902 --> 02:22.402
- She was. / - She never came back from 
walking the dog, Mr. Merced.

02:22.402 --> 02:25.531
The car waited. I called upstairs,
but she wasn't there.

02:25.531 --> 02:27.623
What's going on, Tru?

02:27.623 --> 02:29.082
Where's Frieda?

02:31.239 --> 02:33.578
It's going to her voice mail.

02:35.031 --> 02:39.230
Mother, you go upstairs in case she calls.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.153
I'm going to look for her.

02:41.153 --> 02:44.589
Nelson, call the police right away.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/10/19

03:33.862 --> 03:35.897
The husband had these all over 
the neighborhood by last night.

03:35.897 --> 03:37.700
Do we know where he was 
yesterday afternoon?

03:37.700 --> 03:40.099
At his office.He owns an accounting firm.

03:40.099 --> 03:43.104
Ms. Merced volunteers 
as a bookkeeper for a girls' charity.

03:43.104 --> 03:44.445
She was walkin' over there yesterday.

03:44.445 --> 03:45.557
She never made it.

03:45.557 --> 03:47.580
- How is Mr. Merced?
- A wreck.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.482
Everybody we talked to said 
they were happily married.

03:49.482 --> 03:51.888
Everybody doesn't include Ms. Merced.

03:51.888 --> 03:55.118
Uh, Mr. Merced, these detectives are 
from the Major Case Squad:

03:55.118 --> 03:57.789
Detective Goren and Detective Eames.

03:57.789 --> 03:59.941
Thanks for coming.

03:59.941 --> 04:01.638
Tell me what to do.

04:01.638 --> 04:06.427
I've already called all our relatives, 
our friends, the hospitals.

04:06.427 --> 04:09.055
Have you checked her things to see 
if anything's missing?

04:09.055 --> 04:11.421
- Clothes, jewelry?
- Nothing's missing.

04:11.421 --> 04:14.024
Just what she takes in her purse.

04:14.024 --> 04:15.398
Mr. Merced,

04:16.491 --> 04:19.933
is it possible...
that she doesn't want to be found?

04:19.933 --> 04:21.863
We have no secrets.

04:21.863 --> 04:25.121
If she was unhappy,
she would've said something.

04:25.121 --> 04:26.704
She said she'd be back in 20 minutes.

04:26.704 --> 04:28.180
She wanted to make sure the car 
waited for her.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.308
Her office is a 20-minute walk there and back.

04:31.308 --> 04:33.541
Was she dropping something off,
picking something up?

04:33.541 --> 04:35.312
Was she carrying anything?

04:35.312 --> 04:36.293
Just a big purse.

04:36.293 --> 04:38.561
She had a big white and green envelope 
in there,

04:38.561 --> 04:39.943
maybe this big.

04:40.701 --> 04:44.844
Thanks. / The canvass turned up 
somebody who saw her.

04:44.844 --> 04:49.140
It was, like, half an hour 
before the first race at Belmont.

04:49.140 --> 04:51.673
She walked up to the cab 
with her dog and got in.

04:51.673 --> 04:54.009
And you just noticed her 
when she hailed the cab?

04:54.009 --> 04:55.870
Uh, no. After.

04:55.870 --> 04:57.040
I looked up.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.634
She was walkin' to the cab.
The door was open.

04:58.634 --> 05:00.477
Was there someone in the back?

05:00.477 --> 05:02.207
I couldn't see.

05:02.207 --> 05:04.955
Before she got in,
was the roof light on or off?

05:04.955 --> 05:07.556
Uh, it was off.

05:07.556 --> 05:11.748
Did you happen to notice 
if she was smiling or nervous?

05:11.748 --> 05:12.813
Nervous.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.893
She was throwin' looks over her shoulder.

05:15.893 --> 05:17.785
Maybe because she was being followed?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.599
The cab already had a fare.

05:19.599 --> 05:22.113
Maybe someone she knew rolled up 
and gave her a ride.

05:22.113 --> 05:26.415
- Did you check her phone records?- Yeah. No unusual calls in or out.

05:26.415 --> 05:29.206
Well, where else was she yesterday?

05:29.206 --> 05:31.737
Frieda comes in. It's 40 minutes 
on the treadmill,

05:31.737 --> 05:33.760
20 minutes on the weights,
then out the door.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.287
And same thing yesterday?

05:35.287 --> 05:37.458
Well, yesterday she must've pushed 
too hard,

05:37.458 --> 05:38.810
because she was a little airheaded.

05:38.810 --> 05:40.270
She probably dehydrated herself.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.168
Why? How was she acting?

05:42.168 --> 05:43.803
She was almost out the door

05:43.803 --> 05:47.654
when she thought she left her Walkman 
in her locker, but she had it on.

05:47.654 --> 05:50.399
I tried to tell her,
but she ran down to the locker room.

05:50.399 --> 05:53.413
This is the door she used 
before she ran back inside?

05:53.413 --> 05:55.457
Yeah.

06:03.525 --> 06:05.169
Did you see anyone outside?

06:05.169 --> 06:07.950
I didn't really look.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.385
You use that for membership cards?

06:11.385 --> 06:13.013
Yeah.

06:13.013 --> 06:15.672
Did you take any pictures yesterday morning?

06:16.629 --> 06:18.344
APARTMENT OF
FRIEDA & TRUMAN MERCED 
861 EIGHTH AVENUE 
FRIDAY, JULY 25

06:18.344 --> 06:21.431
These pictures were taken the morning 
your wife was at the gym.

06:21.431 --> 06:23.564
We blew up this portion here.

06:23.564 --> 06:28.673
This man was outside the gym the whole 
time she was there.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.470
Do you know him, Mr. Merced?

06:37.470 --> 06:39.777
I've seen him.

06:40.970 --> 06:46.340
It was... It was two years ago,
at the funeral of Frieda's brother.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.505
I don't know his name.

06:47.505 --> 06:50.086
And he was a friend of her brother?

06:50.086 --> 06:52.315
I don't know. Uh,

06:52.315 --> 06:57.487
I didn't really know Frieda's brother that well.
He was a... a carpenter,

06:57.487 --> 07:00.455
and after we were married,
Frieda lost touch with him.

07:00.455 --> 07:02.457
And then he was killed on 9/11.

07:02.457 --> 07:04.588
He was in the towers?

07:04.588 --> 07:08.256
No. No. Someone killed him for his truck 
in Queens.

07:08.256 --> 07:11.679
It just happened on the same day.

07:14.124 --> 07:17.453
Dan Feist, Frieda's brother, was midtown 
when the planes went into the towers.

07:17.453 --> 07:20.269
He called his wife,
told her he was okay.

07:20.269 --> 07:22.181
That's the last time she talked to him.

07:22.181 --> 07:24.836
They found his body 
that night in Queens.

07:24.836 --> 07:28.212
His skull was cracked open 
with a blunt object.

07:28.212 --> 07:29.669
It was probably a pipe.

07:29.669 --> 07:33.351
His pickup was found stripped three
weeks later in Jackson Heights.

07:33.351 --> 07:37.260
I'd say they put about two hours' work 
into this and called it quits.

07:37.260 --> 07:41.205
Well, maybe because they had 2,000 
other homicides to solve that day.

07:41.205 --> 07:44.215
I'd like us to do better 
by Mr. Feist's sister.

07:44.215 --> 07:47.458
We're hoping to hear from the cabbie 
who picked her up.

07:48.655 --> 07:50.758
We close to puttin' a name to this mug?

07:50.758 --> 07:54.610
No. Mr. Merced's pretty much in the dark 
when it comes to his wife's side of the family.

07:54.610 --> 07:56.488
Yes. Got it. Thank you.

07:56.488 --> 07:59.294
Guess what. Lassie came home.

08:00.093 --> 08:02.241
DEPARTMENT OF
ANIMAL CONTROL
QUEENS, NEW YORK
FRIDAY, JULY 25

08:02.241 --> 08:04.537
Kids found him under an overpass in Queens.

08:04.537 --> 08:06.369
Couple of cats had him cornered.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.058
This all came off the dog?

08:10.058 --> 08:11.250
Mm. Those crumbs.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.660
He must've stepped in something.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.920
It's all over his hind legs.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.333
I don't even wanna
know what that smells like.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.093
It smells like coffee.

08:19.093 --> 08:21.941
He stepped in coffee dust.

08:21.941 --> 08:24.012
And the lab found stains on the knees of

08:24.012 --> 08:27.320
the pants Frieda's brother was
wearing when he was killed.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.503
Stains composed of

08:29.503 --> 08:31.655
fatty acids, diterpene esters,

08:31.655 --> 08:34.741
kahweol, cafestol.

08:34.741 --> 08:36.101
Coffee oil.

08:36.101 --> 08:38.625
Coffee oil on Frieda's brother.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.780
Coffee dust on her dog.

08:43.761 --> 08:45.261
Frieda keeps her own hours.

08:45.261 --> 08:49.002
We didn't even know she was on her 
way here when she disappeared.

08:49.002 --> 08:53.108
She ever talk to you about her family
in Brooklyn or her brother?

08:53.108 --> 08:58.853
Not really. Um, she once mentioned he 
had been killed in a carjacking.

08:58.853 --> 09:00.340
Who's Yolanda?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.520
Yolanda Guerrez?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.142
She runs our corporate giving program.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.015
Could we talk to her?

09:05.015 --> 09:07.130
Yolanda, we need your help here.

09:07.130 --> 09:11.843
Frieda saved an e-mail from Yolanda...
something about nonexistent companies.

09:13.328 --> 09:14.615
Ms. Guerrez,

09:14.615 --> 09:16.701
what's this e-mail about?

09:16.701 --> 09:19.734
Uh, Frieda came back from lunch on Monday

09:19.734 --> 09:22.254
and asked me to look up those companies right away.

09:22.254 --> 09:24.099
She said they were potential donors,

09:24.099 --> 09:28.009
but I couldn't find them listed anywhere.

09:28.009 --> 09:31.357
Did she happen to tell you who she 
went to lunch with or where?

09:31.357 --> 09:33.094
No,

09:33.094 --> 09:37.359
but she brought back some cheese 
she wanted everybody to try.

09:41.618 --> 09:44.223
- Oh, and I thought that dog was ripe.
- Yeah.

09:44.223 --> 09:46.429
Frieda didn't find any takers.

09:46.429 --> 09:50.515
- Yeah, it's very, uh...uh, assertive.
- Yeah.

09:50.515 --> 09:53.279
Sheep's milk.
It's, uh, "rochetta."

09:53.279 --> 09:56.706
- You can tell that just from the smell?
- Label.

09:56.706 --> 09:59.479
It's Italian,
from the Le Langhe region.

09:59.479 --> 10:03.525
There can only be three or four places 
in the city that carry it.

10:04.957 --> 10:06.640
Oh, sure. She was here.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.722
Table seven. Her and another woman.

10:08.722 --> 10:10.324
What did the other woman look like?

10:10.324 --> 10:13.480
She was, uh, younger, maybe 30.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.123
Black hair. Face like a Madonna.

10:15.123 --> 10:17.843
But you could tell by the way she 
held her fork with her fist,

10:17.843 --> 10:20.463
she was less polished than the other one.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.134
You an actress?

10:24.134 --> 10:27.593
I... It's just I can tell by the way 
you notice the little things.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.846
It's how an actor builds character.

10:30.846 --> 10:35.935
I overheard the younger one asking 
this lady for some kind of a favor.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.734
Do you remember a name 
or what it was about?

10:38.734 --> 10:41.119
No. No.
But they were looking over tax forms.

10:41.119 --> 10:43.946
I remember 'cause I spilled sauce on
one of them.

10:43.946 --> 10:48.005
Form 706 from 2001.

10:48.005 --> 10:50.716
Well, I gotta get back to my acting studies.

10:50.716 --> 10:53.620
Sure. Uh, good luck.

10:55.794 --> 10:59.173
2001. That's the year Frieda's brother died.

10:59.173 --> 11:01.168
706...

11:03.525 --> 11:09.119
is the federal estate tax form,
something a widow would fill out.

11:09.815 --> 11:12.351
HOME OF ISOBEL CARNICKI
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
WEDNESDAY, JULY 30

11:12.351 --> 11:16.280
I asked her to help me with this problem 
having to do with Dan's taxes.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.379
That's my late husband... Dan.

11:18.379 --> 11:19.697
What was the problem?

11:19.697 --> 11:21.358
They said he owed extra taxes

11:21.358 --> 11:24.632
because they couldn't collect 
from the companies he worked for.

11:24.632 --> 11:26.582
Because the companies didn't exist?

11:26.582 --> 11:27.957
It didn't make sense.

11:27.957 --> 11:29.862
That's why I asked Frieda to help me.

11:29.862 --> 11:31.201
She's a bookkeeper.

11:31.201 --> 11:33.245
Why didn't you ask 
your late husband's accountant?

11:33.245 --> 11:34.955
Dan did his own taxes.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.470
And I didn't want to go to Earl's accountant.

11:37.470 --> 11:39.090
Earl?

11:39.090 --> 11:40.921
It's my new husband.

11:40.921 --> 11:42.474
We got married last year.

11:48.094 --> 11:50.738
E.C. That's...
These are his?

11:50.738 --> 11:54.058
He started collecting those 
after he got injured on his job.

11:54.058 --> 11:55.847
He was a cop.

11:55.847 --> 11:59.436
Now he's a partner in a security company.

11:59.436 --> 12:03.582
You didn't want him to know 
about Dan's tax problems?

12:03.582 --> 12:05.606
I didn't wanna worry him.

12:05.606 --> 12:07.912
He's been so good to me.

12:07.912 --> 12:10.133
After Dan died,

12:10.133 --> 12:14.089
if it weren't for Earl, I don't know 
how I would've gone on.

12:14.089 --> 12:17.202
Anyway, I don't know 
what this has to do with Frieda.

12:17.202 --> 12:19.062
Uh, the day she disappeared,

12:19.062 --> 12:22.509
she was being followed by this man.

12:25.890 --> 12:29.386
Oh, that's, uh, Bennie.

12:29.386 --> 12:31.636
I think he's an electrician.

12:31.636 --> 12:35.973
He worked with Dan sometimes,but he was following Frieda?

12:35.973 --> 12:43.918
The picture was taken outside her gym 
the morning that she disappeared.

12:43.918 --> 12:45.985
The tax papers...

12:45.985 --> 12:48.318
Do you think we could have a look at them?

12:48.318 --> 12:51.377
I gave them to Frieda.

12:51.377 --> 12:53.175
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE
76 MURRAY STREET
WEDNESDAY, JULY 30

12:53.175 --> 12:57.953
We sent Mr. Feist's estate a bill last May 
for unpaid Social Security taxes.

12:57.953 --> 13:01.084
We never heard back from him.That's what triggered the audit.

13:01.084 --> 13:06.628
So you discovered Mr. Feist reported income 
from companies that didn't exist?

13:06.628 --> 13:07.729
Yes.

13:07.729 --> 13:13.592
Uh, Mr. Feist declared a reimbursement 
for an overpayment on his property tax,

13:13.592 --> 13:17.907
but I don't see that he owned a property.

13:17.907 --> 13:21.396
The property lot number for the reimbursement is...
is in here.

13:21.396 --> 13:23.690
Do you mind looking it up on the county 
Web site?

13:23.690 --> 13:25.148
Yeah. It's moot anyway.

13:25.148 --> 13:30.107
I already got a call from the estate
to discuss a settlement.

13:30.107 --> 13:31.468
The property's in Queens.

13:31.468 --> 13:36.240
Its owner is actually listed as a Harmony, Inc.,

13:36.240 --> 13:39.622
one of the nonexistent companies.

13:39.622 --> 13:41.637
He used it to pay taxes on property

13:41.637 --> 13:44.084
he doesn't want anyone else 
to know that he owned.

13:51.092 --> 13:55.343
Do you smell it? / I'm gettinga caffeine buzz just breathing it in.

14:05.115 --> 14:09.868
Looks like this place was 
an old coffee warehouse at one time.

14:11.739 --> 14:12.758
Look at this.

14:12.758 --> 14:15.793
This look like standard equipment 
for a carpenter?

14:17.449 --> 14:19.452
This is dog hairs.

14:42.142 --> 14:45.024
Something was dug out of here with a knife.

14:45.024 --> 14:46.616
Could be slugs.

14:51.619 --> 14:53.176
This is a killing room.

14:55.111 --> 14:58.661
This is the source of income
that Dan Feist was hiding.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.742
He was a hit man.

15:03.742 --> 15:07.749
And somebody took up where he left off.

15:13.020 --> 15:16.099
The only prints we could match 
belonged to Dan Feist.

15:16.099 --> 15:21.476
Two partials on the faucet 
and one thumbprint on the meat hook.

15:21.476 --> 15:23.982
That pegs him as the one using this facility.

15:23.982 --> 15:28.371
C.S.U. Identified half a dozen blood 
samples of different vintage.

15:28.371 --> 15:30.365
And Feist's sister, Frieda?

15:30.365 --> 15:34.002
Besides the dog hair,
no sign of her.

15:34.002 --> 15:37.801
So this lady was looking into 
her brother's taxes,

15:37.801 --> 15:40.677
she was on her way to figuring out 
he was a hit man...

15:40.677 --> 15:44.552
A can of worms his former employers 
wouldn't want opened.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.591
One of the blood samples
in the warehouse belonged to Feist.

15:49.791 --> 15:55.738
So Feist was killed in his own workshop 
and then dumped elsewhere?

15:55.738 --> 15:58.732
If it was a rival gang, 
they would've left a calling card.

15:58.732 --> 16:00.230
They wouldn't have made
it look like a mugging.

16:00.230 --> 16:02.180
So maybe his own people did it.

16:02.180 --> 16:05.727
For some transgression or mistake,

16:05.727 --> 16:08.997
something they needed to cover up.

16:08.997 --> 16:12.670
I reserved you a suite at the Waldorf, 
and I got Jerry cookin' a special meal...

16:12.670 --> 16:14.004
I don't want a suite.

16:14.004 --> 16:17.817
After five years, I wanna sleep in my own bed.

16:17.817 --> 16:20.195
Sure, Pops.
I just thought you'd want some kind of...

16:20.195 --> 16:23.240
Stop anticipating what I want.

16:23.240 --> 16:28.249
I'm holding my breath, hoping nothing 
screws up my parole, okay?

16:28.249 --> 16:30.339
Nothing's gonna screw it up.

16:30.339 --> 16:31.604
Good.

16:31.604 --> 16:33.919
That's what I want.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.424
Okay?

16:40.424 --> 16:41.811
He'll be okay when he's home.

16:41.811 --> 16:44.143
Nothing can screw this up.

16:47.515 --> 16:50.475
HOME OF
EARL & ISOBEL CARNICKI
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
MONDAY, AUGUST 4

16:50.475 --> 16:52.409
My late husband wasn't...

16:54.982 --> 16:57.422
How can they make up these stories?

16:57.422 --> 16:58.653
It's just supposition.

16:58.653 --> 17:01.658
We feel pretty strongly about it,Mr. Carnicki.

17:01.658 --> 17:05.211
Sure. Or you wouldn't be hereupsetting my wife.

17:05.211 --> 17:09.784
We think Dan did something to provoke 
the people he worked for to kill him.

17:09.784 --> 17:16.044
Anything you can remember about 
his activities before he died could help us.

17:16.044 --> 17:19.212
The last two weeks before Dan got killed,

17:19.212 --> 17:22.798
we were away in Lake Champlain,
just the two of us.

17:22.798 --> 17:24.434
And before that, in August?

17:24.434 --> 17:28.530
He had a construction job
to finish in Nassau.

17:28.530 --> 17:29.815
He was coming home late.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.890
I remember I had a bad flu.

17:31.890 --> 17:35.729
He brought things home for you 
when you were sick?

17:35.729 --> 17:37.611
Soup and magazines and...

17:37.611 --> 17:41.741
Yeah. He was thoughtful that way.

17:41.741 --> 17:45.466
He'd bring me crossword puzzles,
some medications.

17:45.466 --> 17:47.742
Do you remember where he got them?

17:47.742 --> 17:49.645
I remember the name on the bag.

17:49.645 --> 17:52.644
Something with flowers.

17:52.644 --> 17:57.277
Wh... Floral Park is in Nassau County.

17:57.277 --> 18:02.800
Yeah. It was Floral Park Chemists.
That was it.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.760
Here we go.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.057
The Floral Park crime sheet for August 2001.

18:07.057 --> 18:09.766
We got a murder four blocks from the pharmacy

18:09.766 --> 18:11.766
and three break-ins on the same street,

18:11.766 --> 18:14.917
all on the night of August 20.

18:14.917 --> 18:17.044
Ha. Our murder victim.

18:17.044 --> 18:21.694
Anson MacDonald, 73, widower,
strangled in his den...

18:21.694 --> 18:26.154
The back door was jimmied,
house ransacked.

18:26.154 --> 18:29.246
All that activity and Forensics 
didn't find a single fingerprint

18:29.246 --> 18:31.492
or a fiber that didn't belong there?

18:31.492 --> 18:33.047
This was a clean killing.

18:34.629 --> 18:38.337
What about the break-ins?

18:38.337 --> 18:40.674
Well, this one was an attempted break-in.

18:40.674 --> 18:42.354
The window screen was cut open.

18:42.354 --> 18:44.593
Something must've scared the perp.

18:44.593 --> 18:45.590
This was an attempt also.

18:45.590 --> 18:49.184
They got the back door open,
and they took off.

18:49.184 --> 18:52.199
Same story here.

18:52.199 --> 18:55.646
These break-ins were just decoys 
to mask the fact that...

18:55.646 --> 18:59.077
Mr. MacDonald was the target of a hit.

18:59.077 --> 19:01.573
Well, he was a retired civil attorney.

19:01.573 --> 19:06.120
Maybe there's more about him in here.

19:07.130 --> 19:10.534
"Mr. MacDonald pulled no punches 
during his press conference."

19:10.534 --> 19:14.663
""The D.A. Should be ashamed of the laughable 
sentences handed out to murderous,

19:14.663 --> 19:20.182
parasitic scum... like Jimmy Limone 
and other mobsters.""

19:20.182 --> 19:24.258
Sounds like Old MacDonald rubbed 
some people the wrong way.

19:24.258 --> 19:26.420
LAW OFFICE OF
MACDONALD & MACDONALD
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
TUESDAY, AUGUST 5

19:26.420 --> 19:29.400
After your comments about Mr. Limone,
did you get any threats?

19:29.400 --> 19:31.696
Just a couple of angry phone calls.

19:31.696 --> 19:33.932
Anyway, I didn't even make it past the
primary.

19:33.932 --> 19:36.535
And then your father was killed...
Anson Senior?

19:36.535 --> 19:40.605
Yes. My wife and I were away 
on a cruise when we heard.

19:40.605 --> 19:43.105
Why do you ask about my father though?
Is there new information?

19:43.105 --> 19:45.612
This man's name is Dan Feist.

19:45.612 --> 19:47.245
He's a hired killer.

19:47.245 --> 19:49.994
He was in your father's neighborhood 
at the time of his murder.

19:49.994 --> 19:52.365
But Dad was killed by a burglar.

19:52.365 --> 19:55.955
There were too many inconsistencies.

19:55.955 --> 20:00.420
We think this man was sent because of 
your comments about Mr. Limone.

20:00.420 --> 20:04.502
But why would they hurt my father?
Wouldn't they come after me?

20:04.502 --> 20:06.723
Well, you both have the same name.

20:06.723 --> 20:10.897
You're both lawyers.
You both work out of the same office.

20:10.897 --> 20:14.346
You were out of town.

20:14.346 --> 20:18.147
It was mistaken identity,
Mr. MacDonald.

20:18.147 --> 20:20.000
Oh, my God.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.442
Because of what I said?

20:22.442 --> 20:24.774
They whacked the wrong lawyer.
That beats all.

20:24.774 --> 20:26.568
And they killed two people to
cover it up.

20:26.568 --> 20:29.833
Jimmy Limone's parole is coming up. 
We need to get with Carver on this.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.499
With what you have now?

20:31.499 --> 20:36.337
Well, we can connect Limone to this thing.

20:36.337 --> 20:40.873
The man that was outside of Frieda's gym...

20:40.873 --> 20:43.764
He's a match for Bennie Messina.

20:43.764 --> 20:47.421
He's an associate of Limone's son, Richie.

20:47.421 --> 20:50.508
Great. Get a warrant for himfirst thing in the morning,

20:50.508 --> 20:52.470
but stay away from Carver.

20:52.470 --> 20:55.780
We still have too many loose threads.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.516
Well, he's not wrong.

20:58.516 --> 21:02.191
For example, how did Limone know Frieda 
was looking into Dan's taxes?

21:02.191 --> 21:06.427
Isobel didn't tell anyone about 
the tax problem except Frieda.

21:08.862 --> 21:12.707
Well, the I.R.S. Investigator said 
she got a call about a settlement.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.506
Who called her?

21:18.506 --> 21:21.206
I was so stupid.

21:21.206 --> 21:26.942
How can you love somebody and not know 
that everything they tell you is a lie?

21:26.942 --> 21:33.634
Because when you love a person, you have 
to believe that they love you back, okay?

21:33.634 --> 21:34.802
Mm.

21:37.274 --> 21:40.111
I'm going to bed.

21:42.153 --> 21:44.062
I'm gonna be up in a minute.

21:48.608 --> 21:52.424
Oh, I left my reading glasses in the car.

22:05.459 --> 22:07.804
I called the I.R.S.
Because Earl asked me to.

22:07.804 --> 22:10.353
The tax situation was upsetting his wife.

22:10.353 --> 22:13.095
He didn't wanna drag it on.He wanted to settle.

22:13.095 --> 22:15.389
Because a settlement would stop the audit.

22:15.389 --> 22:18.903
The agent has a quota to meet.
She wants to clear the case.

22:18.903 --> 22:20.657
So you make a deal.

22:20.657 --> 22:22.851
It's a game,and you're good at it.

22:22.851 --> 22:24.482
Do I look like I'm starving?

22:24.482 --> 22:26.771
When did Earl first mention the tax problem?

22:26.771 --> 22:28.985
That would be Wednesday, two weeks ago.

22:28.985 --> 22:31.673
The day before Frieda disappeared.

22:31.673 --> 22:33.537
Do you remember exactly what he said to you?

22:33.537 --> 22:37.285
He was freaked out,
and he wanted me to make it go away.

22:37.285 --> 22:39.588
I'll bet he did. Okay. Thank you, sir.

22:39.588 --> 22:42.972
We might be in touch with you.Okay.

22:42.972 --> 22:45.014
Isobel tells Frieda about the tax problem,

22:45.014 --> 22:46.834
Earl finds out, he panics.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.840
Only one reason why.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.714
If someone found out that Dan was a hit man,

22:51.714 --> 22:55.765
they also might've found out that Earl 
had something to do with killing him.

22:55.765 --> 22:58.261
So he panics, and Frieda disappears.

22:58.261 --> 23:01.871
Earl must've been workin' with Bennie. 
That's why Frieda got in the cab.

23:01.871 --> 23:03.604
Earl was in it.

23:03.604 --> 23:07.350
Are we expecting a call from 
the Harbor Patrol?

23:07.350 --> 23:11.623
They pulled him out of the drink 
near the Narrows around 9:00 a.m.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.870
They rolled his prints,

23:13.870 --> 23:18.251
and voila... Bennie Messina.

23:18.251 --> 23:19.575
You have a cause of death?

23:19.575 --> 23:21.783
Mm. He just came in an hour ago.

23:21.783 --> 23:25.974
Off the top, he doesn't look like he's 
been in the water more than 12 hours.

23:27.589 --> 23:29.260
What's all this?

23:29.260 --> 23:32.043
Oh, once the current gets ahold of'em, 
your floater gets banged up

23:32.043 --> 23:33.688
pretty good on the rocks.

23:33.688 --> 23:38.324
These rocks have very interesting patterns.

23:38.324 --> 23:41.223
You keep doin' that,
I'm gonna drop this kid right here.

23:41.223 --> 23:44.623
Do you see this imprint on the skin?

23:44.623 --> 23:52.291
It looks like the crisscrossed lines of 
latitude and longitude... of a brass globe...

23:52.291 --> 23:58.318
one that you might use as 
the handle of a walking stick.

23:58.318 --> 24:02.164
Earl and Bennie had a falling out.

24:04.833 --> 24:08.265
This is all the canes Earl has.
He doesn't keep them anywhere else.

24:08.265 --> 24:10.915
I remember seeing it.
It was a brass globe.

24:10.915 --> 24:14.478
I don't pay much attention to his canes.
Maybe you're mistaken.

24:14.478 --> 24:16.422
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

24:16.422 --> 24:20.064
Look, we're just gonna have to take 
all the canes to the lab.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.599
Were you and Earl home last night?

24:23.599 --> 24:27.059
Yes. We watched TV and we had 
some ice cream.

24:27.059 --> 24:29.022
Oh, okay. And now you're gonna tell me which...

24:29.022 --> 24:32.071
the exact shows that you watched were 
and what flavor ice cream.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.943
Come on. I know that Earl was a detective.

24:33.943 --> 24:35.793
He knows the kind of details we look for.

24:35.793 --> 24:37.066
I don't know why you say that.

24:37.066 --> 24:39.369
Earl's a good person.

24:39.369 --> 24:44.032
Well, you thought Dan was a... good person too.

24:44.032 --> 24:46.393
I don't wanna talk about him.
He can rot in hell.

24:46.393 --> 24:50.357
Fine. I'm happy to talk about Earl.

24:53.973 --> 24:56.503
Tsang Fu.

24:56.503 --> 25:00.353
That's "husband" in Chinese.
Beginning Chinese?

25:02.567 --> 25:04.817
It's always the same place.

25:04.817 --> 25:07.362
The White Swan Hotel.

25:07.362 --> 25:12.248
They always put the parents up there
if you're gonna...

25:12.248 --> 25:15.153
adopt a child in China.

25:15.153 --> 25:17.462
Yes.

25:17.462 --> 25:20.632
But it's taking forever because of that virus.

25:22.325 --> 25:26.370
Do you mind if I ask you one question...how the two of you met?

25:26.370 --> 25:29.675
I was at the police precinct.

25:29.675 --> 25:34.041
It was a couple of months after Dan had, uh...

25:34.041 --> 25:36.835
And I was just there trying 
to get some information.

25:36.835 --> 25:39.566
And Earl was there,
and he saw me waiting.

25:39.566 --> 25:41.426
And I was very upset.
And...

25:41.426 --> 25:42.930
And he talked to you,

25:42.930 --> 25:47.616
listened to you, made you feel like 
you weren't so alone.

25:47.616 --> 25:49.443
We liked the same things.

25:49.443 --> 25:52.602
For our first date, he surprised me,
and he took me to a Spanish restaurant,

25:52.602 --> 25:54.279
which is my favorite food.

25:54.279 --> 25:56.241
You should see the flowers he bought me.

25:56.241 --> 25:58.814
Same kind Dan used to buy

26:01.378 --> 26:05.030
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.756
I turned around as soon as I got your message.

26:06.756 --> 26:08.793
Michael called.
They're lookin' at the office too.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.138
They won't tell me what they want.

26:10.138 --> 26:11.709
They don't have to.

26:11.709 --> 26:14.707
Come on. Let's let 'em do their work.

26:20.217 --> 26:22.677
C&C SECURITY
76 EAST 3RD STREET
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 6

26:22.677 --> 26:25.138
Your warrant says I have tolet you search his office.

26:25.138 --> 26:27.569
It doesn't say I have toanswer your questions.

26:27.569 --> 26:30.950
That's right. That would take a subpoenafrom the grand jury.

26:33.663 --> 26:36.145
You have nice offices here.

26:36.145 --> 26:39.152
- Your background's in law enforcement?
- No.

26:39.152 --> 26:40.900
Well, then, your partnership...

26:40.900 --> 26:46.198
You put up the money,
and Earl kicked in his police expertise?

26:52.996 --> 26:56.291
- Ah, geez.
- Here. Let me.

26:56.291 --> 26:59.296
Oh, l... Whoa.

26:59.296 --> 27:01.174
Oh, it's just, uh...

27:01.174 --> 27:02.840
Did somebody turn up the heat?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.552
You should sit here.

27:04.552 --> 27:06.076
I'll get you a glass of water.

27:06.076 --> 27:08.439
No. I'll be okay. I just need to finish.

27:08.439 --> 27:10.447
You should wait for the other detective.

27:10.447 --> 27:12.681
No. No. This is embarrassing enough.

27:12.681 --> 27:14.362
I have to pull my own weight.

27:14.362 --> 27:18.438
I understand.
Just catch your breath.

27:18.438 --> 27:22.232
You're a decent guy, Mr. Carling.

27:22.232 --> 27:24.925
You got into business with a bad guy.

27:24.925 --> 27:28.290
One way or another,
Earl's going to jail.

27:28.290 --> 27:31.577
And you could lose all the money you 
put into this business.

27:35.963 --> 27:38.276
That missing woman...

27:38.276 --> 27:41.931
A couple of days earlier,
she was here with Earl.

27:41.931 --> 27:44.842
There were looking over some tax forms.

27:47.761 --> 27:49.738
Well, that's very good,

27:49.738 --> 27:53.832
Mr. Carling.
Thank you.

27:53.832 --> 27:56.813
Oh, I almost forgot.

27:56.813 --> 28:00.189
Do you have any decoy vehiclesyou use for surveillance...

28:00.189 --> 28:04.069
delivery vans or old taxicabs?

28:04.069 --> 28:07.424
Yes. A couple of yellow cabs.

28:07.424 --> 28:10.014
And they don't keep records,so Earl could've taken out a cab,

28:10.014 --> 28:14.960
but the lab couldn't find any trace of Frieda 
or her dog in either cab.

28:17.454 --> 28:19.723
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

28:21.250 --> 28:24.821
You have an offended mobster and his son,

28:24.821 --> 28:27.926
a case of mistaken identity,

28:27.926 --> 28:30.484
an incompetent hit man,

28:30.484 --> 28:32.803
a hit man's widow,

28:32.803 --> 28:35.456
a hit man's missing sister,

28:35.456 --> 28:37.612
a corrupt cop,

28:37.612 --> 28:40.456
and now, another dead killer.

28:40.456 --> 28:42.438
It's... It's operatic.

28:42.438 --> 28:46.735
Isobel said that it was uncanny 
when they first started dating...

28:46.735 --> 28:50.826
how much they liked the same things.

28:50.826 --> 28:52.535
Well, no wonder.

28:52.535 --> 28:57.993
When he was following Dan Feist,
waiting for his chance to kill him,

28:57.993 --> 29:02.983
Earl saw what kind of restaurants that... 
that Dan took her to...

29:02.983 --> 29:05.089
and what kind of flowers that he bought her.

29:05.089 --> 29:09.322
If anyone deserves to have the curtain 
dropped on him, it's Earl.

29:09.322 --> 29:13.778
We might have a case against him for 
the murder of Mr. Messina.

29:13.778 --> 29:15.350
If you're right,

29:15.350 --> 29:18.116
and Earl's wife knows what happened,

29:18.116 --> 29:19.535
she might help us.

29:19.535 --> 29:25.317
Uh, what, and testify against the only 
man that's brought light into her life?

29:25.317 --> 29:28.694
Let's try something different.

29:28.694 --> 29:31.001
LINCOLN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
30 WEST 110TH STREET
THURSDAY, AUGUST 7

29:31.001 --> 29:33.529
""The D.A. Should be ashamed 
of the laughable sentences...

29:33.529 --> 29:35.637
handed out to the murderous,

29:35.637 --> 29:40.378
parasitic scum likeJimmy Limone...and other mobsters.""

29:40.378 --> 29:44.293
So? I care what a two-bit politician 
I never heard of says about me?

29:44.293 --> 29:47.384
Somebody cared enough to put a hit on 
Anson MacDonald.

29:47.384 --> 29:49.262
And they got Dan Feist to do it.

29:49.262 --> 29:51.137
But there was a glitch.

29:51.137 --> 29:54.396
This is the man Mr. Feist actually killed:

29:54.396 --> 29:57.723
Anson MacDonald, Sr.

29:57.723 --> 30:00.287
They killed him by mistake.

30:00.287 --> 30:01.890
You don't say?

30:04.941 --> 30:07.651
Was this your bright idea, Richie?

30:07.651 --> 30:10.776
I don't know anything about it.

30:10.776 --> 30:14.050
I didn't know anything either.

30:14.050 --> 30:16.128
See, after Feist made his mistake,

30:16.128 --> 30:19.722
somebody had him killed by these two:

30:19.722 --> 30:21.936
Bennie Messina

30:21.936 --> 30:24.560
and a cop.

30:24.560 --> 30:29.188
Bennie. Well,
he's already been taken care of.

30:29.188 --> 30:32.923
This one?He's why we're here talkin' to you.

30:32.923 --> 30:37.744
I'm not takin' the weight for some jackass.

30:37.744 --> 30:40.948
I'm walkin' outta here on parole next week 
no matter what,

30:40.948 --> 30:44.311
so somebody better help you.

30:47.773 --> 30:52.277
Bennie ran his own burglary crew.

30:52.277 --> 30:55.199
He had his hooks in a copin the 71 st Precinct...

30:55.199 --> 30:57.339
uh, Earl something.

30:59.032 --> 31:02.034
He gave Bennie security system plans,

31:02.034 --> 31:04.188
patrol schedules, that kind of stuff.

31:04.188 --> 31:07.006
And Bennie's recent dealings with Earl?

31:08.174 --> 31:13.675
Uh, last I know those two got together...
was back in May for a coin store heist.

31:13.675 --> 31:16.966
- Last May?
- Yeah.

31:16.966 --> 31:20.648
That's all I know. I swear, Pops.

31:20.648 --> 31:23.820
That's all.

31:23.820 --> 31:26.687
I have a sense that's all we're gonna 
get out of Mr. Limone, Jr.

31:26.687 --> 31:30.273
We're back to Isobel Carnicki as our only 
witness against Earl.

31:30.273 --> 31:32.578
And as you pointed out,
she won't talk.

31:32.578 --> 31:35.216
Maybe we're arresting the wrong Carnicki.

31:35.216 --> 31:36.618
Isobel was home.

31:36.618 --> 31:38.374
She knows what happened.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.253
Last May...

31:41.879 --> 31:45.044
that was when Isobel got a letterfrom the I.R.S.,

31:45.044 --> 31:47.667
a letter that she never answered.

31:50.924 --> 31:52.633
Uh...

31:59.384 --> 32:03.195
Yes. Can I have the number of the Chinese 
Consulate in Manhattan, please?

32:07.160 --> 32:09.707
Shao Hai Tze...

32:09.707 --> 32:11.451
That's Chinese for "a baby."

32:13.703 --> 32:18.010
The message I got was that she'd been 
arrested as a material witness.

32:18.010 --> 32:20.580
It's for her protection.

32:20.580 --> 32:25.124
The D.A. Thinks she has information 
on the murder of Bennie Messina.

32:25.124 --> 32:28.142
He was a soldier in the Limone gang.

32:28.142 --> 32:33.216
We suspect they've already murdered her 
late husband and her sister-in-law.

32:33.216 --> 32:36.382
God. She must be scared out ofher mind.

32:36.382 --> 32:39.688
As soon as they're done booking her, 
they'll bring her up here to see you...

32:39.688 --> 32:41.104
as a courtesy.

32:41.104 --> 32:44.321
Isobel doesn't deserve this.
She's a terrific girl.

32:44.321 --> 32:46.576
Oh, thank God.

32:46.576 --> 32:48.235
They arrested me.

32:48.235 --> 32:50.356
It's okay.

32:50.356 --> 32:52.563
The captain told me everything.

32:52.563 --> 32:54.278
Why don't you two have a seat?

32:59.162 --> 33:04.699
It's about Bennie Messina's murder,
Ms. Carnicki.

33:04.699 --> 33:06.754
I know you weren't telling the truth 
about the walking stick,

33:06.754 --> 33:09.815
because I saw it the first timewe visited you.

33:09.815 --> 33:11.333
Well, I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.273
I never owned a canelike the one you described.

33:13.273 --> 33:16.424
- How 'bout it, Ms. Carnicki?
- Earl's right.

33:16.424 --> 33:19.641
Unfortunately, I have to go with 
what the detectives tell me.

33:19.641 --> 33:22.425
I'm gonna recommend 
that you be held without bail.

33:22.425 --> 33:23.927
Oh, for God's sakes.

33:23.927 --> 33:26.007
My wife?

33:26.007 --> 33:27.811
Look, I'm a retired detective.

33:27.811 --> 33:30.945
You don't want her goin' to jail,
Mr. Carnicki,

33:30.945 --> 33:33.901
you know what to do.

33:33.901 --> 33:35.607
You bastards.

33:37.946 --> 33:39.366
Don't worry, sweetheart.

33:39.366 --> 33:42.448
I won't let 'em do anything to ya.

33:45.414 --> 33:46.829
So that guy, Bennie,

33:46.829 --> 33:48.967
he stopped by our house.
He had a gun.

33:48.967 --> 33:51.464
He was gonna kill us like 
they killed Isobel's sister-in-law.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.373
He was wavin' it around at us...

33:52.373 --> 33:56.760
Um, why don't you let Isobel tell the rest.

33:59.985 --> 34:02.695
Bennie had pointed his gun at us.

34:02.695 --> 34:06.017
I was so scared, I started to cry,and Bennie told me to shut up.

34:06.017 --> 34:08.619
- And I got the jump on him.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:10.529 --> 34:12.271
Go on.

34:12.271 --> 34:14.186
Earl hit him with the cane,

34:14.186 --> 34:16.230
and then Bennie was dead.

34:16.230 --> 34:18.313
Earl told me that I couldn't tell anyone

34:18.313 --> 34:22.114
and then showed me how to clean up the
blood while he drove off with Bennie.

34:22.114 --> 34:24.487
I was terrified. I mean,

34:24.487 --> 34:26.868
if Jimmy Limone found out what happened,

34:26.868 --> 34:29.012
he would've sent 10 guys after us.

34:29.012 --> 34:31.829
It was self-defense.

34:31.829 --> 34:33.706
Self-defense works for me.

34:33.706 --> 34:36.341
Self-defense, Isobel?

34:38.094 --> 34:40.629
Bennie was gonna kill ya?

34:40.629 --> 34:45.723
Earl slammed that brass ball into his head.

34:47.101 --> 34:51.275
Well, it's a good thing 
that Bennie didn't get a shot off.

34:51.275 --> 34:55.280
- Earl knocked the gun out of Bennie's hand.
- He did?

34:55.280 --> 34:57.650
After Bennie fell.

34:57.650 --> 35:03.904
The gun was still in his hand,
so Earl hit it and knocked it away.

35:03.904 --> 35:06.504
Good job, Earl.

35:06.504 --> 35:08.907
Yeah. Sure.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.364
We just need formal statements.

35:13.749 --> 35:16.958
Yeah. Was it the right handor the left hand?

35:16.958 --> 35:18.876
His right.

35:18.876 --> 35:22.306
Because there would've been a bruise,

35:22.306 --> 35:24.544
but there wasn't a bruise...

35:25.845 --> 35:30.826
because Earl didn't hit Bennie in the hand.

35:35.102 --> 35:36.950
Did he?

35:38.998 --> 35:41.328
I don't know.

35:41.328 --> 35:43.382
You don't know what Earl did...

35:43.382 --> 35:49.874
because you didn't see exactly 
what happened, did ya?

35:49.874 --> 35:53.206
Because Earl told you what to say,didn't he?

35:53.206 --> 35:55.124
What is this? A joke?

35:55.124 --> 35:58.428
Richie Limone told usBennie had a dirty cop in the 71,

35:58.428 --> 36:01.295
a cop who told him all about alarm codes.

36:01.295 --> 36:03.770
So you're gonna believe some lowlife mutt?

36:03.770 --> 36:05.602
Bennie tried to kill us.

36:05.602 --> 36:08.511
When he found you at the precinct,

36:08.511 --> 36:12.395
you were waiting for news about Dan.

36:12.395 --> 36:15.541
Earl ever tell you exactlywhat he was doing there?

36:15.541 --> 36:17.451
He said he had business there.

36:17.451 --> 36:21.491
He retired six weeks before.
It wasn't even his precinct.

36:21.491 --> 36:25.483
It's the oldest trick on the force. Cops.

36:25.483 --> 36:30.075
Some of'em hit on female crime victims.

36:30.075 --> 36:32.004
It wasn't like that.

36:33.762 --> 36:37.291
When the two of you met,
it was like kismet, huh?

36:37.291 --> 36:39.940
The way Earl knew yalike the back of his hand.

36:42.011 --> 36:47.031
Well, he should've.
He'd been watching you for a long time.

36:47.031 --> 36:49.510
This guy's out of his mind.

36:49.510 --> 36:52.975
Oh, come on, Earl.

36:52.975 --> 36:56.977
Bennie told you that Dan screwed up 
and you had to take care of him.

36:56.977 --> 36:59.415
Isobel, he's just playing games.

36:59.415 --> 37:00.702
This is all bull.

37:00.702 --> 37:07.737
And that's when you met his beautiful wife,
who loved him, took care of him.

37:07.737 --> 37:10.617
He had it pretty good for a hit man.

37:10.617 --> 37:13.182
What did you have?

37:13.182 --> 37:15.058
Nothin'?

37:15.058 --> 37:19.582
You're just a lonely,
divorced, dirty cop.

37:19.582 --> 37:21.123
You envied Dan.

37:21.123 --> 37:26.381
You wanted to take what he had,
step into his shoes, into his bed.

37:26.381 --> 37:28.390
Oh, shut up!

37:28.390 --> 37:29.948
This is sick!

37:29.948 --> 37:33.093
This is sick crap!

37:33.093 --> 37:35.010
Don't you listen to it, Isobel.

37:35.010 --> 37:38.015
That's why he flipped out 
when Frieda came to see him at his office.

37:38.015 --> 37:41.783
She suspected Dan of being a criminal.

37:41.783 --> 37:46.157
Earl, you didn't tell methat you talked to her.

37:46.157 --> 37:48.240
Well, she asked me not to.

37:48.240 --> 37:53.198
She was worried you were in trouble 
with the I.R.S.

37:53.198 --> 37:55.384
You believe him, Isobel?
Hmm?

37:59.096 --> 38:02.631
Or do you believe that knot in your stomach?

38:02.631 --> 38:07.460
Isobel?
Baby, I love you.

38:07.460 --> 38:09.353
I need you.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.932
He couldn't.

38:11.932 --> 38:14.680
He couldn't have hurt my Dan.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.229
I didn't. I swear.

38:17.229 --> 38:25.035
Isobel, tell us what happened that night 
when Bennie came over.

38:25.035 --> 38:28.046
Don't you say anything.

38:28.046 --> 38:32.008
I... I heard them in the driveway laughing...

38:32.008 --> 38:34.294
- Don't!
- And then I heard a noise,

38:34.294 --> 38:37.118
and then I went outside,
and he was dead.

38:37.118 --> 38:39.830
And Earl said he had pulled a gun on him,
but there wasn't any gun.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.705
There was never any gun.

38:41.705 --> 38:43.998
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Why...

38:43.998 --> 38:46.386
Earl, you are under arrest for murder.

38:49.065 --> 38:53.144
Isobel, I didn't hurt Dan!

38:53.144 --> 38:55.896
I didn't do it.!

38:55.896 --> 39:00.022
I love you. I need you.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.401
Sweet?

39:08.694 --> 39:11.033
Isn't it?

39:11.033 --> 39:13.042
Revenge?

39:19.560 --> 39:24.920
Uh, we were about to sign off on 
your self-defense story, Earl,

39:24.920 --> 39:27.270
until your wife told us that...

39:27.270 --> 39:30.377
well, that you knocked 
the gun out of Bennie's hand.

39:30.377 --> 39:34.903
That was an unnecessary,
damning embellishment.

39:34.903 --> 39:36.197
Why'd you do that?

39:36.197 --> 39:40.530
I think she didn't want Earl skating 
by on a self-defense rap.

39:40.530 --> 39:46.102
When did you find out,
Isobel? Last May?

39:46.102 --> 39:51.733
When Earl and Bennie were working 
on that coin shop heist?

39:51.733 --> 39:53.524
You saw them get together,

39:53.524 --> 39:56.548
overheard them talkin;
Things fell into place...

39:56.548 --> 40:00.296
who killed Dan... your Dan.

40:02.972 --> 40:04.872
I wanna go home.

40:04.872 --> 40:08.250
You couldn't go to the police,to Earl's buddy boys. Who'd believe you?

40:08.250 --> 40:10.007
Even if they did,

40:10.007 --> 40:12.553
you'd still have Earl's other buddies 
to deal with.

40:12.553 --> 40:16.566
And if Earl was gonna pay for his crime,

40:16.566 --> 40:19.762
well, someone else would have to do 
the dirty work.

40:19.762 --> 40:23.182
Isobel, what are they talkin' about?

40:23.182 --> 40:28.731
The letter the I.R.S.
Sent her in May?

40:28.731 --> 40:32.126
All you had to do was write a check.
There would've been no audit.

40:32.126 --> 40:34.882
No one would've found out 
what Dan did for a living,

40:34.882 --> 40:38.320
why he was killed,
who killed him.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.799
Isobel?

40:39.799 --> 40:41.705
Then the audit came.

40:41.705 --> 40:45.915
And you needed someoneto help push things along.

40:45.915 --> 40:49.138
So you went to Frieda.

40:49.138 --> 40:55.676
But you never thought that she was gonna 
actually talk to Earl about it.

40:55.676 --> 40:58.029
Or that he'd kill her.

40:58.029 --> 40:59.760
It's not true.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.782
I would never do anything against you, Earl.

41:02.782 --> 41:05.824
What? Even now you're still afraid of him?

41:05.824 --> 41:12.114
You're not afraid of me.
She loves me.

41:12.114 --> 41:16.010
- We were gonna raise a kid together.
- Yeah. Right.

41:16.010 --> 41:21.203
The adoption that was delayed 
by the SARS virus.

41:21.203 --> 41:25.181
The adoption agency said that the alert 
was lifted in...

41:25.181 --> 41:27.166
in May?

41:29.106 --> 41:33.314
They told Isobel.

41:33.314 --> 41:37.986
She told them thatbecause of a family emergency,

41:37.986 --> 41:44.346
the adoption would have to bepostponed indefinitely.

41:44.346 --> 41:46.689
You see?

41:46.689 --> 41:50.778
The family emergency, Earl?
That's you going to prison.

41:54.914 --> 41:56.712
You got him.

41:56.712 --> 41:59.164
You got him but good.

42:03.752 --> 42:07.640
I wouldn't raise a dog with you.

42:11.832 --> 42:17.503
But Dan was a killer...
Dan was a cold-blooded killer.

42:17.503 --> 42:19.903
He was getting out of it,

42:19.903 --> 42:22.094
and he never lied to me.

42:22.094 --> 42:23.905
But you...

42:23.905 --> 42:26.874
you're nothin' but lies.

42:28.905 --> 42:30.794
So what happens to me now?

42:32.436 --> 42:34.212
Your behavior may not be ethical

42:34.212 --> 42:37.297
but as far as I can tell,you haven't broken any laws.

42:37.297 --> 42:40.496
I do expect you to testifyat your husband's trial.

42:40.496 --> 42:46.908
Oh.

42:46.908 --> 42:49.505
I only ever had one husband.

42:51.721 --> 42:53.675
Come on, guys.

42:56.233 --> 42:59.170
So much for passing out brains 
with those gold shields.

42:59.170 --> 43:03.195
If anyone objects...to letting Ms. Carnicki 
off the hook...

43:03.195 --> 43:06.972
Maybe we should keep an eye on
who she marries next.

43:06.972 --> 43:10.149
What a lucky guy that'll be.
