Juliette and Alex

09:44.451 --> 09:46.217
seem really good

Juliette's pretty much

gunning for becoming

09:54.127 --> 09:55.427
Mrs. Kompo.
That's obvious.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.328
I mean

09:56.330 --> 09:57.896
good luck with that.
It's a dream.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.698
For the last few months,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.433
she hasn't texted me one time

10:01.435 --> 10:05.236
to get dinner, go out,
not even to get coffee.
Well, that's...

10:05.238 --> 10:06.371
I'm like,
"Some friend you are."

10:06.373 --> 10:09.374
It's almost like
she was trying to be

10:09.376 --> 10:12.444
such good friends with me
just to get with Alex,

10:12.446 --> 10:14.746
and now that she has him,
she doesn't care at all.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.581
I mean, but no one
really ever has Alex,

10:16.583 --> 10:18.750

If I texted and/or

I thought it was gonna be,
like, a king or something.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.568

(laughs)
Yeah.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.537
Our parents actually met.

16:12.539 --> 16:13.771
What?
We went to dinner--

16:13.773 --> 16:15.440
How did that go?
--on a yacht.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.475
Dinner on a yacht, what a great
first parents meeting.
I know.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.811
My parents were like,
"Oh, okay."

16:19.813 --> 16:21.479
Would you expect anything less
from Gary?
I know.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.880
But it went really well.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.416
They kind of bombarded us
with questions.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.385
So how serious is it?
Is it marriage serious?

16:27.387 --> 16:28.553
Do you think you're gonna be

16:28.555 --> 16:30.855

Mrs. Kompothecras one day?

16:30.857 --> 16:32.156

16:32.158 --> 16:35.259
I mean... I only have
one year of college left,

16:35.261 --> 16:36.327

thinking about,

16:36.329 --> 16:37.762
like, the rest of my life.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.031
I mean, I'm glad you guys
are doing good now but...

16:40.033 --> 16:42.266
your relationship has been
a roller coaster.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.835
It's been up and down,
so just don't forget

16:43.837 --> 16:45.403
the things
that he's done to you.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.205
Because you just
always gotta be careful

16:47.207 --> 16:50.575
and know that he's capable
of doing those things again.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.744
Yup.
No, I know that.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.512
I think that every
once in a while, but...

16:54.514 --> 16:56.781
the more we started
spending time together,

16:56.783 --> 16:59.417
he realized
he really, like, loved me

16:59.419 --> 17:01.185
and he didn't want to
hurt me, um...

17:01.187 --> 17:03.321
He's really attentive
to me.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.056
He does
a lot of things for me.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.191
He got me a YSL bag
for Christmas--

17:07.193 --> 17:08.659
What?!
--which is big.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.294
I was very shocked
when he did that.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.297
It's an extravagant gift.
He's just really caring.
Yeah.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.299
I just know Alex
has a wandering eye,

17:15.301 --> 17:18.202

I...

I was in the back.
So I would jump out.
Okay.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.757

Yeah.
Yeah.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.713
