WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.720
Discriminatory Language

00:03.720 --> 00:06.360
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.120
It has been a long time since my
last confession in this church.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.480
Welcome back.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.680
Hawthorne is the name.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.320
Lord Hawthorne.
You are the talk of the village.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.640
Hardly surprising. Things are about
to become

00:19.640 --> 00:22.200
rather more interesting
around here.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.800
In what way?

00:23.800 --> 00:27.200
Important men will visit me
and this very church.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.840
Dignitaries.
Even world leaders.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.560
You, vicariously,
will become rather important.

00:33.560 --> 00:34.720
Oh.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.200
You will have the privilege
of being at my beck and call,

00:37.200 --> 00:39.880
to attend to my spiritual needs.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.000
I will do my best.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.880
As I do for all my parishioners.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.080
Father, you do know who I am?

00:48.080 --> 00:49.400
Yes.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.680
Then you know how
deep my pockets are.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.560
I will fund a new church roof and
whatever else you want.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.880
That's very kind of you.
It's not an act of charity.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.520
It's to show my appreciation
for your devotion.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.520
With respect, Lord Hawthorne,

01:06.520 --> 01:09.200
my devotion is not for sale.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.360
Bishop Reynard warned me you
might not be amenable.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.000
Too concerned with extra
curricular activities.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.640
But I told him we should give you
a chance to prove your loyalty.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.160
From now on I suggest your first
duty is to me.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.920
My first duty is to God.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.280
Please, do not smoke.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.480
It is an offence to God's Holy
House and Sacrament...

01:36.480 --> 01:39.640
Father, as far as you should be
concerned...

01:39.640 --> 01:42.560
I am God.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.160
Just think, the owner of
the Daily Enquirer

02:19.160 --> 02:21.000
returning to St Mary's.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, he's a role model, I suppose.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.560
Indeed.
Pity about the son.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.120
I can't imagine Lord
Hawthorne's shame.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.680
Shame?

02:29.680 --> 02:32.360
Father, do you never read
the newspaper?

02:32.360 --> 02:35.040
A different floozy every
night, apparently.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.920
Father,
I'm so glad you could make it.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.440
Meet my son,
Gabe.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.800
Gabe.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800
Fresh out of Cambridge.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.280
A pleasure, Father.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.800
Mrs McCarthy, parish secretary.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.920
And this gorgeous creature is
Margot, my wife.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.440
Charmed. I'm so looking forward
to getting to know everyone.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.560
It's an honour to have you here.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.000
Now, if there's anything you need,
anything at all.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
We'll let you know. Father, let me
introduce you to my former priest

03:01.000 --> 03:02.480
from London.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.760
Father Brown,
Father Featherstone.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.160
He could teach you a thing or two.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.520
Father, I do not know how you do it.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.000
Do what exactly?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.040
This place.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.120
I'll concede it's
aesthetically pleasing

03:20.120 --> 03:23.000
but, my goodness,
it is dull.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.680
Heaven knows how Arthur will cope
so far away from civilisation.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.560
He may enjoy the pace of life here.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.760
Between us,

03:29.760 --> 03:33.240
your pace of your life is
going to change somewhat.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.080
I'm reliably informed that you are
the hub of the community?

03:37.080 --> 03:38.440
Oh, I don't know about that.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.640
Though I suppose you could say
I am at the heart

03:40.640 --> 03:42.680
of most things
that happen in the village.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.120
I should very much like to write
for the parish magazine.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.720
I have experience at the Enquirer.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.920
Oh, you write. Though I can't say
I've ever seen your name.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.240
I write Arthur's editorials.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.880
Not that that's common knowledge,
you understand?

03:58.880 --> 04:01.120
Your secret is safe with me.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.960
May I ask what has brought you back
to Kembleford?

04:06.360 --> 04:10.200
Entre nous,
a health scare of Arthur's.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.520
I insisted on a change of life.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.840
Away from Westminster
and high society.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.800
Back to his roots,
where nothing ever happens.

04:19.160 --> 04:23.080
What are your plans now,
after Cambridge?

04:23.080 --> 04:26.760
Between us, Father,
I intend to travel.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.640
To avoid the prying eyes of
the British press?

04:29.640 --> 04:32.880
Exactly. No more waking up
to slanderous articles.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.840
Oh, you'll be far too busy
to disgrace my name any further.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.800
I don't understand.
Your time has come, my boy.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.880
Top job is yours.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
Aren't you going to thank me?

04:46.360 --> 04:50.480
Thank you. Would you excuse me?

04:54.120 --> 04:57.760
Detective Inspector Mallory,
my Lord. Kembleford Police.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.440
And Sergeant Goodfellow,
sir. At your service.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.520
Oh, yes. I've heard good things.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.200
All of them true.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.000
Don't believe we've had
the pleasure. Father Brown.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.840
You're not going to preach at me,
are you?

05:12.840 --> 05:16.000
Wouldn't dream of it.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.720
Is it just me or can you smell...?

05:18.720 --> 05:19.960
Garlic?

05:19.960 --> 05:23.520
My thoughtless landlady dried my
shirt on the line.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.360
Well, good job you're not
a vampire, then.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.000
I'm not sure I can say
the same about our host.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.760
Not a friend of Lord Hawthorne's?

05:32.760 --> 05:34.320
More of a victim, actually.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.680
I see. Did he print something?

05:37.680 --> 05:41.160
Ruined me for a few column inches.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.040
Thanks to him I'm what you might
call a social pariah.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.240
Which rather begs
the question,

05:47.240 --> 05:49.080
why are you here?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.400
Would it help to talk?

05:52.400 --> 05:55.200
I appreciate your concern, Father.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.720
But your God and I are no
longer compatible.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.960
Lady Hawthorne,
is everything all right?

06:16.960 --> 06:20.600
Have you met our former priest,
Father Featherstone?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.440
Oh, delighted to make
your acquaintance.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.200
Do I detect a Cork accent?
What a divine place.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.160
Yes, well, I can hardly disagree
with you there.

06:29.160 --> 06:33.440
Tell me, do you find Kembleford as
provincial as I do?

06:33.440 --> 06:35.040
Provincial?

06:35.040 --> 06:38.080
I happen to be the
parish secretary.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.760
Oh, I see. Would you excuse me?

06:43.440 --> 06:46.360
I get the impression
that the 'top job'

06:46.360 --> 06:48.960
isn't your lifetime's ambition.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.480
Was it obvious?

06:50.480 --> 06:52.000
Hello, Arthur.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.920
I'm afraid I haven't the foggiest.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.840
Now, if you'll excuse me.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.440
You know exactly who I am.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.840
Inspector, would you remove this,
erm...

07:06.840 --> 07:09.000
..gentleman?
If you don't mind?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.400
Time I left, anyway.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.280
Oh, and Arthur...

07:13.280 --> 07:16.400
..your actions, they do have
consequences.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.640
Enjoy the party.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.600
GLASS DINGS

07:21.600 --> 07:26.720
Thank you. Thank you, you've all
made me feel very welcome.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.360
Well, almost everyone.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.440
What a terrible waste of
a rather fine champagne.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.200
Now, as some of you may know,

07:35.200 --> 07:38.320
Margot has pushed me out to pasture.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.200
While I will remain as chairman,

07:41.200 --> 07:46.320
it is time I stepped down as editor
of my beloved Enquirer.

07:47.320 --> 07:52.800
But it gives me great pleasure
to introduce my successor.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.120
Has anyone seen my...?

08:03.080 --> 08:04.760
Somebody call an ambulance.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.320
You're in good hands, Lord
Hawthorne.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.320
Pressure, Sergeant. Pressure.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.160
Right you are, Father.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.320
Father...

08:14.320 --> 08:16.360
Father, where are you...?

08:21.160 --> 08:23.360
The shot must have been taken
from here.

08:25.120 --> 08:30.320
So what exactly
are we supposed to be looking for?

08:36.200 --> 08:37.600
Ooh.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.760
"FL".

08:42.760 --> 08:44.440
Who's "FL"?

08:45.840 --> 08:47.360
Who indeed?

08:48.600 --> 08:52.200
I'm fine. Merely a flesh wound.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.880
Who would do such a thing?

08:53.880 --> 08:56.720
Maybe the man who threw his
champagne in my face.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.840
Have the police caught him yet?

08:58.840 --> 09:01.240
No. But they've left
an officer outside.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.440
You're quite safe.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.480
Where were you both during
my speech?

09:05.600 --> 09:07.760
I was trying to find Mother.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.480
I had to lie down.
A splitting headache.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.920
Oh, what bad timing.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.480
Father.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.400
I'm relieved to see you looking
so well.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.360
Would you excuse us?

09:21.360 --> 09:22.680
Of course.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.240
I must update the press.
And Winston.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.760
As in Churchill.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.920
Thank you for attending to me.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.120
I trust you've had
a change of heart?

09:35.120 --> 09:38.360
Rest assured, I will support you as
much as I can.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.960
But?

09:40.960 --> 09:43.920
I must serve my
parishioners equally.

09:43.920 --> 09:48.520
Therefore I cannot commit to being
at your sole beck and call.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.480
Then I seriously advise you request
a transfer.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.680
St Mary's has been my parish for
a long time.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.560
Please respect my position.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.440
Respect is all that I asked for.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.000
I think we're done here.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.400
Thank you.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.840
Canon Fox, good morning.
To what do we owe the...?

10:20.840 --> 10:24.400
This isn't a social call,
I'm afraid.

10:24.400 --> 10:28.960
It is with a heavy heart that on
the orders of Bishop Reynard

10:28.960 --> 10:32.560
I must suspend you
with immediate effect.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.880
I don't understand.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.840
We have been informed that you have
broken the seal

10:36.840 --> 10:39.200
of the confessional.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.560
Father Brown is incapable of such
a thing.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.080
Who has made this complaint?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.480
I'm not at liberty to say.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.920
Oh, but you believe it, do you?

10:47.920 --> 10:50.600
I will carry out an investigation,

10:50.600 --> 10:53.360
the findings of which will be sent
to Rome

10:53.360 --> 10:55.920
for the attention of His Holiness.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.480
I can assure you,
I am entirely innocent.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.480
I do hope that's true.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.520
Alas, if found guilty,

11:03.520 --> 11:07.280
your excommunication
will be confirmed.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.720
Ah, Father. You're here.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.000
None of this makes any sense.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.320
We take these accusations
extremely seriously.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.360
However, Father Brown may remain
here for now.

11:25.360 --> 11:29.200
And how are we supposed
to manage without our priest?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.280
Father Featherstone has kindly
agreed

11:31.280 --> 11:34.760
to step into the breach until this
matter is resolved.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.800
But he's...

11:36.800 --> 11:39.280
..he's not even from this diocese.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.880
Arrangements have been made.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.520
Good day, Mrs McCarthy.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.080
How nice to see you again.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.120
Father?

11:55.120 --> 11:56.880
In here.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.320
Father...

12:03.520 --> 12:05.600
..how can you defend yourself

12:05.600 --> 12:09.080
if they won't tell you anything
about this allegation?

12:09.080 --> 12:12.040
The seal of the confessional
is sacrosanct.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.040
Don't worry, I'm sure
everything will...

12:14.040 --> 12:17.600
Yes... Yes, I'm sure everything will
be just grand.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.760
I don't mean to intrude...

12:22.760 --> 12:25.200
So, about this complaint.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.280
It wouldn't have been made by
someone

12:28.280 --> 12:30.000
of great influence, would it?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.640
Complaint?I have been accused of
breaking the seal.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.760
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.280
Could someone show me to my room?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.880
Certainly, Father.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.920
I only hope it isn't too
"provincial" for you.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.920
My men are on the case.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.920
But as our prime suspect
didn't speak to any guests

12:51.920 --> 12:54.480
he's proving difficult to identify.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.000
I should have told you.
I saw him talking to Father Brown.

12:59.240 --> 13:02.720
Why am I not surprised.
Thank you for your time.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.240
Until this man is caught

13:04.240 --> 13:06.080
I don't want either of you
out of my sight.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.040
In that case, perhaps someone else
should take over at the Enquirer.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.920
Someone with the right experience.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.880
I will oversee your editorship.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.800
I thought you had retired.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.000
So I'll have time to train him up.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.680
Actually, I'm not sure it's for me.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.880
Going to stand on your own two feet,
are you?

13:22.880 --> 13:24.560
With your reputation?

13:24.560 --> 13:27.840
Trust me,
this will be the making of you.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.960
Of course. I'll head to Fleet Street
as soon as this is all over.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.400
Good.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.160
This was your intention all along,
wasn't it?

13:38.160 --> 13:41.920
To use him as your puppet.
Your editor by proxy.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.320
He'll just need some guidance at
first. And your editorials.

13:45.320 --> 13:48.760
Well, then it's perhaps time
I used my own opinion.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.080
Fallen off the wagon, have we?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.600
Of course not.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.520
Then why are you
being obstreperous?

13:54.520 --> 13:56.360
I really can't fathom why.

14:01.320 --> 14:05.400
I was so very saddened
to hear about your predicament.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.680
Though I do suppose that means you
won't be

14:07.680 --> 14:09.680
getting under my feet anymore.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.640
So, every cloud.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.920
How can I help you Inspector?

14:14.920 --> 14:18.800
I gather you spoke to the man who
caused the altercation yesterday.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.120
You really should have said.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.400
He seems to bear
a grudge against Lord Hawthorne

14:23.400 --> 14:26.400
for something he printed.
That's all I know.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.360
That's all I need.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.560
By the way, what will people call
you now,

14:31.560 --> 14:33.840
Mr Brown?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.520
You'll always be the Padre to me.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.720
Father, the cufflink.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.000
Now, if you can find
the owner of that cufflink,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.520
then you'll have found the culprit,

14:49.520 --> 14:52.680
and Lord Hawthorne will have
to come to his senses.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.760
The milk is off.
Isn't that the last straw?

14:58.760 --> 15:01.440
Garlic.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.120
Mrs Beckett's.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.040
How did you know I was here?

15:28.040 --> 15:29.720
A hunch.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.760
I recalled that Mrs Beckett
sells garlic,

15:31.760 --> 15:35.560
which she grows behind her B&B.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.320
Might I ask your full name?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.760
Stanley Buchanan. Why?

15:40.760 --> 15:42.000
Oh.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.640
Do you recognise this?

15:45.640 --> 15:47.160
Should I?

15:47.160 --> 15:51.080
I believe that it belongs to
the person who shot Lord Hawthorne.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.880
I heard on the wireless.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.920
I'm just sorry it's not
more serious.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.160
He thinks you're responsible.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.280
Well, perhaps he should look closer
to home.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.680
What do you mean by that?

16:01.680 --> 16:04.160
His wife was looking rather
murderous at the party,

16:04.160 --> 16:06.240
right after she received
a package.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.320
Nothing to do with me,
I hasten.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.920
Then why don't you go to the police?

16:09.920 --> 16:12.080
Allow them to eliminate you from
their enquiries?

16:12.080 --> 16:16.040
I don't trust them, Father.
We have history.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.720
Because you're homosexual?

16:19.720 --> 16:22.960
And Lord Hawthorne put that in print
and made you a pariah.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.880
Thanks to Hawthorne I'm
an exile in my own country.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.960
Work, family, friends,

16:27.960 --> 16:30.760
the only man I ever loved,
all gone.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.480
You hide your disgust well, Father.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.840
I have none to hide.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.760
How were you incriminated?

16:37.760 --> 16:40.880
An unjust encounter with the law.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.320
I haven't done anything.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.520
Afterwards they searched my
university rooms.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.200
Found love letters.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.400
Proof of my inclinations.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.680
Did your friend suffer
the same fate?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.480
Thankfully his letters weren't
submitted as evidence.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.800
Sergeant McNally's testimony
was enough.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.400
He claimed I'd been caught in
a compromising position

17:02.400 --> 17:04.480
with another man. One who
conveniently escaped

17:04.480 --> 17:06.760
as I was arrested.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.160
He perjured himself?

17:08.160 --> 17:11.080
I refuse to deny who I am.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.080
For which you have,
no doubt, paid a high price.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.440
My time on remand
left its mark on me.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.520
So I agreed to hormone therapy,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.600
to avoid a custodial sentence.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.880
Chemical castration.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.200
I'm so sorry.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.440
But if I am indeed "cured",

17:28.440 --> 17:31.800
then why do I feel so dead inside?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.760
You will find solace in God.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.120
It's too late for that, Father.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.680
I will find out who is responsible.

17:37.680 --> 17:41.320
Thank you for leading me straight
to him, Padre.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.880
I am arresting you for the attempted
murder of Lord Hawthorne.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.000
I didn't do it.
You are not obliged to say anything,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.960
but anything you do say may be given
in evidence.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.360
Trust me.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.840
If it wasn't him,
who else could it be?

17:54.840 --> 17:57.040
Apparently Lady Hawthorne received
a package

17:57.040 --> 17:59.040
at the party which angered her.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.600
Right enough, she did look very
upset before the speech.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.000
I didn't see her.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.680
Nor her son Gabe,
for that matter.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.960
Evening mass,

18:07.960 --> 18:09.560
whoever heard of such a thing?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.240
The arrogance of that man.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.680
Father, are you sure you really
want to face this?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.720
God is testing me.

18:20.720 --> 18:25.080
But I have faith that
the truth will out.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.720
I know this must be unsettling
to see me up here,

18:28.720 --> 18:32.800
but let me assure you that one thing
will never change,

18:32.800 --> 18:35.080
God's love for us.

18:35.080 --> 18:40.000
So we must honour that love by
resisting temptation,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.960
being kind,
standing up for what is right.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.840
CLATTERING

18:50.080 --> 18:52.520
He will...

18:52.520 --> 18:54.280
We will disappoint Him.

18:55.720 --> 19:00.960
But as long as you confess your sins

19:00.960 --> 19:03.720
and truly repent,

19:03.720 --> 19:06.000
then all will be forgiven.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.080
Thank you for coming.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.120
Godspeed.

19:12.480 --> 19:16.440
I realise this must be difficult
for you.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.120
Well, I must admit it's
a novel experience,

19:19.120 --> 19:22.200
being in the congregation
of your own church.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.240
Mrs McCarthy,

19:24.240 --> 19:27.600
I fear we didn't set off on
the right foot.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.920
Tea is in order.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.480
And perhaps some
of your legendary scones?

19:31.480 --> 19:35.200
My scones are only for
the rightful priest of this parish.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.120
Father?

19:39.560 --> 19:42.880
I think it best that you keep
a low profile.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.200
Your presence here will not help
the congregation

19:45.200 --> 19:46.960
accept Father Featherstone.

19:46.960 --> 19:51.080
With respect, Canon Fox, this is
surely a temporary situation.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.920
Because you will find out
the truth, won't you?

19:54.920 --> 19:59.160
Lord Hawthorne,
it's good to see you up and about.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.600
Oh, it takes far more than that
to take down my husband.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.120
It seems that your reputation as
an amateur sleuth is justified.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.840
Then please heed my advice
and reinstate your protection.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.600
Perhaps that's for the best.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.840
Nonsense. Mallory has his man.
I'm perfectly safe.

20:12.840 --> 20:13.960
Now, come along.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.640
Did you see that?

20:18.640 --> 20:20.160
Yes.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.360
Trouble in paradise, perhaps?

20:23.360 --> 20:25.680
MALLORY: Your motive couldn't be any
clearer.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.240
Revenge on Lord Hawthorne
for fulfilling his moral duty.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.320
Moral duty?

20:31.320 --> 20:35.400
As you're perfectly aware,
what you do is illegal.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.640
Which serves only
to make others like me vulnerable

20:37.640 --> 20:39.320
to blackmail.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.800
And police corruption,
as I know only too well.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.720
The law protects those who are
normal from being converted.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.600
So you think I could convert you?

20:49.600 --> 20:51.120
What are you implying?

20:51.120 --> 20:54.040
Well, if it's that easy.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.560
I was talking about
the suggestable.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.160
Believe me, Inspector,
you're quite safe.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.320
Men like myself pose no threat
to anyone,

21:01.320 --> 21:04.040
and yet we are perceived
to be worse than murderers.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.120
Can't you see that's wrong?

21:06.120 --> 21:11.240
All I see is that what you do
is perverted.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.000
Then perhaps you should consider why
you feel so threatened by it.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.320
Enough.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.280
You told Lord Hawthorne that his
"actions have consequences."

21:20.280 --> 21:22.760
A statement of intent if ever
I heard one.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.800
If I was going to shoot him would
I really have made

21:24.800 --> 21:26.600
a scene in public first?

21:26.600 --> 21:28.120
You have no evidence.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.160
No gun?

21:31.160 --> 21:34.880
I'd say your position hangs on
a very delicate thread.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.120
My position?

21:36.120 --> 21:38.640
I can only imagine what your
superiors will say.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.080
When the real perpetrator finishes
the job.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.160
I saw the light on.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.680
I can't sleep.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.920
No. Maybe a game of dominoes?

21:54.920 --> 21:56.600
Why not.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.280
Take your mind off things.

21:58.280 --> 22:01.400
Whatever would I do without you,
Mrs McCarthy?

22:05.120 --> 22:08.760
I suppose you know who is sleeping
like a baby?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.960
I'm not so sure.

22:10.960 --> 22:15.200
Well, let me tell you, no-one was
impressed by that "performance"

22:15.200 --> 22:17.080
of his in church today...

22:17.080 --> 22:18.440
CLATTERING

22:18.440 --> 22:20.200
RUMBLING

22:20.200 --> 22:21.560
Is that who I think it is?

22:23.440 --> 22:25.320
At this time of night?

22:29.000 --> 22:33.480
VEHICLE APPROACHING

23:05.320 --> 23:08.120
Police, now.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.240
Someone is trying to kill me.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.200
I arrived just after the incident.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.280
Unfortunately I didn't see anyone.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.240
And all staff were present
and correct after the shooting?

23:26.240 --> 23:30.080
I'm sure of it. Only these two were
unaccounted for.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.800
I've been having trouble sleeping.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.040
I had to go for a walk
to clear my head.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.680
As did I.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.960
Together?

23:36.960 --> 23:38.680
No.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.120
And did you happen
to see anything suspicious?

23:41.120 --> 23:44.280
If we had, don't you think we
would've said something?

23:47.320 --> 23:50.600
Sir, I found this hidden in
the wood.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.800
We'll get it checked
but it looks like a match

23:52.800 --> 23:55.640
for the bullet that was fired at
you, my Lord.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.440
I could have been killed
because of your incompetence.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.800
If it is the same weapon then you
have my assurance

24:01.800 --> 24:04.840
that we will catch the real culprit.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.720
You no longer have my full
confidence, Inspector.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.320
You asked to see me, Lord Hawthorne?

24:17.640 --> 24:19.560
I should have listened to you.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.440
And perhaps I wasn't entirely fair.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.160
Entirely?
But if you find out who's behind it,

24:26.160 --> 24:29.840
then we can forget about
the other business.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.120
The other business is my calling.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.400
My vocation. My home.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.240
Then you should have fallen
into line.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.680
I serve God.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.360
Not parishioners with
a God complex.

24:42.360 --> 24:45.400
Are you going to help me or not?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.200
I'll need the guest list from
the party.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.160
It's yours.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.120
Lady Hawthorne and your son,
are they proficient?

24:52.120 --> 24:53.760
We're a shooting family.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.480
I'll do all I can.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.600
Oh, but you'd better hurry.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.960
By the end of the day,

25:00.960 --> 25:04.120
wheels will have been set in motion
which I cannot stop.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.760
There was no "FL" on the guest list.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.320
But Lady Hawthorne and Gabe were
conspicuously absent

25:16.320 --> 25:18.400
during the second shooting.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.600
I can't believe Lady Hawthorne
is responsible.

25:21.600 --> 25:25.920
And besides, wouldn't
the cufflink suggest a man?

25:25.920 --> 25:30.200
I get the impression Gabe wants
to break free from his Father.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.520
But would he attempt patricide
for that reason?

25:33.520 --> 25:36.480
There is another person who was
missing

25:36.480 --> 25:38.440
when Lord Hawthorne was shot.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.800
The same person who's contraption we
heard last night.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.840
I will speak to Father Featherstone.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.480
Could you try and find out what was
in the package

25:49.480 --> 25:52.520
that was delivered
to Lady Hawthorne?

25:52.520 --> 25:55.080
I will do my very best, Father.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.160
And don't you worry,

25:57.160 --> 25:59.400
we are going to put an end
to this...

25:59.400 --> 26:00.800
..this madness.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.440
I thought a tour of
the village might be in order.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.720
I'd like that.
Have you met Bucephalus?

26:12.720 --> 26:15.880
Named after Alexander
the Great's war horse.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.680
This beauty is Jude.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.880
Named after the priest who inspired
my calling.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.520
Inspired?
In what way?

26:22.520 --> 26:25.600
I was quite the delinquent,
if you can believe that.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.840
He straightened me out,
showed me the path to God.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.920
Then you have come far.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.120
I couldn't help
but hear Jude last night.

26:34.120 --> 26:37.080
Just before the latest shooting.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.960
I went to see Lord Hawthorne.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.400
Just as well, really, as he was
quite unsettled after what happened.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.120
At mass, Lord Hawthorne's arrival
unsettled you.

26:47.520 --> 26:51.840
Just at the point where you were
talking about doing the right thing.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.800
Nerves got the better of me.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.960
Or perhaps you are painfully
aware

26:55.960 --> 26:59.520
that Lord Hawthorne's allegation
against me is false.

26:59.520 --> 27:03.880
Father, I know that Kembleford is
not your natural habitat,

27:03.880 --> 27:06.920
so why would you agree
to come here?

27:06.920 --> 27:09.720
Do you really think I had a choice?

27:09.720 --> 27:13.280
If you're quite finished,
I need to get cleaned up.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.000
I'll give the tour a miss.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.640
Thank you.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.920
Lady Hawthorne.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.960
How nice to see a friendly face.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.640
Well, a friend in need.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.360
After what happened last night

27:31.360 --> 27:33.640
I thought you might want
some company.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.920
Thank you, but I'm fine.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.400
Would you like one?

27:38.400 --> 27:39.880
At this hour?

27:39.880 --> 27:42.080
No, no, I think not.

27:42.080 --> 27:44.680
I wouldn't normally,
but with a madman on the loose...

27:44.680 --> 27:46.040
Yes.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.080
I'll ask Danby to get you some tea.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.560
Oh, thank you.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.880
What are you doing?

28:13.880 --> 28:16.200
I'm sorry, Lady Hawthorne.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.840
Get out!

28:25.120 --> 28:27.480
Did you really have no idea?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.200
When Arthur had his health scare,

28:34.200 --> 28:36.760
there was a young woman at
the hospital.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.240
He said she found him on the street.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.400
But I knew he was lying.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.080
Of course he was repentant.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.320
Assured me it was a one-off.

28:47.320 --> 28:50.320
I see.
He moved here to mollify me.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.760
Away from distractions.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.800
So I'm just going to burn those and
forget it.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.080
Do you really think you
can forget?

29:00.080 --> 29:04.360
My husband was an adulterer.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.800
I chose not to live a lie

29:06.800 --> 29:10.520
and I haven't regretted that for
a single second.

29:10.520 --> 29:13.280
I won't ruin him or shame Gabe.

29:16.640 --> 29:21.920
Bridget, please promise me you won't
tell anyone about this.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.480
Rest assured, Lady Hawthorne,
I can be the soul of discretion.

29:27.120 --> 29:30.400
I saw the photographs
with my own eyes.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.760
Can you believe the hypocrisy of
that man?

29:33.760 --> 29:37.000
Lady Hawthorne would appear to have
the most compelling motive.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.360
And, yet, I get
the impression Father Featherstone

29:40.360 --> 29:42.440
is here against his will.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.680
Now, that's exactly what
Mrs Herbert thought.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.200
Who?
His parish secretary in Chelsea.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.360
I've just spoken to her on
the telephone.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.840
And she, for the life of her,

29:51.840 --> 29:55.960
couldn't understand how he would
willingly accept a post like this.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.640
Did she say why?

29:57.640 --> 30:01.000
Oh, because he had his eye on
becoming an Archbishop,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
would you believe?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.520
Well, then, it all makes sense.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.400
Does it?
We haven't got much time.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.200
So which one of you was it, then?

30:13.200 --> 30:16.080
God knows it should have been me.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.720
Perhaps it's one
of your mistresses?

30:18.720 --> 30:20.320
I received those at the party.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.800
From who?

30:24.800 --> 30:28.840
Oh. Of course.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.440
You stay there.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.120
All the things he said about me.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.120
He acts like he's some kind
of moral guardian

30:39.120 --> 30:41.080
but he's nothing more than
a philanderer.

30:41.080 --> 30:45.000
We'll draw a line under it.
Kembleford is a new start.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.960
Do you really think he can change?

30:46.960 --> 30:49.120
Look at what he's turned you into.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.880
You're so much better than this.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.360
I gather you had
a stellar career mapped out.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.920
Which makes me wonder
why you agreed to come here?

31:12.200 --> 31:15.200
Did Lord Hawthorne make you
an offer you couldn't refuse?

31:17.480 --> 31:22.160
I am complicit in a great injustice.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.680
Yours.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.640
I don't think it's going to work out
with Father Brown.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.000
He'll come round.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.280
If not, I want you to take over.

31:32.280 --> 31:35.720
Here? I'm flattered.
But you know my ambitions.

31:35.720 --> 31:40.000
One year. Help me settle in.
Then I'll pull some strings.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.560
A promotion?

31:41.560 --> 31:47.160
Bishop by 35, I'd imagine.
A meteoric rise.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.760
Do we have a deal?

31:48.760 --> 31:50.000
Of course. But what about...?

31:50.000 --> 31:54.080
Father Brown? Just leave him to me.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.520
I had no idea he would stoop
this low.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.040
Is that why you went
to see him last night?

32:02.240 --> 32:04.600
I went to tell him I couldn't be
a part of it.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.800
And now I must leave
the priesthood.

32:17.360 --> 32:22.200
No. You know if you confess
and repent,

32:22.200 --> 32:25.480
God will forgive you. As, will I?

32:26.880 --> 32:31.520
When I tell the truth, Arthur will
ensure that I am excommunicated.

32:33.680 --> 32:36.920
Which is nothing less than
I deserve.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.680
Resigning really is
the only honourable way out.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.600
And what then?

32:44.600 --> 32:48.040
I'll find a new way to serve God.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.960
Somewhere far away from here.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.040
Ah, there you are.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.920
Time for our chat.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.880
My findings are to be sent
to Rome in the morning.

32:57.880 --> 33:01.960
Lord Hawthorne has fabricated
this allegation.

33:01.960 --> 33:05.360
And why exactly would he do that?

33:05.360 --> 33:08.280
I cannot break the seal of
the confessional.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.760
Then my hands are tied.

33:10.760 --> 33:13.400
On behalf of Bishop Reynard I'd like
to thank you

33:13.400 --> 33:15.400
for your many years of service.

33:15.400 --> 33:20.600
It has been memorable knowing you,
if nothing else.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.520
I have something to say.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.880
Who went to Cambridge?

33:33.440 --> 33:34.880
I beg your pardon?

33:34.880 --> 33:36.720
Had a pair of these myself.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.320
Yes, I used to like to tread
the boards.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.480
You need to know that...

33:40.480 --> 33:43.640
No, he doesn't.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.160
Thank you.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.520
He really doesn't.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.400
Must dash.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.120
They're sure? Ballistics confirm
the rifle fired both bullets, Sir.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.920
Fingerprints?
Wiped clean.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.520
We need something to go on.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.720
Our ruddy necks are on
the line here, Sergeant.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.280
Ours, Sir?

34:09.440 --> 34:11.080
You're free to go.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.200
I'm waiting for my apology.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.320
I'm sure we'll be seeing you again.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.520
Father, what can I do for you?

34:30.720 --> 34:34.000
The shot into your father's study
was a miss.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.160
So I assume you only meant
to scare him,

34:36.160 --> 34:39.440
as by all accounts you are
an excellent shot.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.680
I don't understand.

34:48.120 --> 34:52.840
FL. Not as I first presumed,
someone's initials,

34:52.840 --> 34:57.960
but the Footlights, a comedy review
society at Cambridge.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.360
The university from which you have
just graduated.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.160
I wasn't a member. Ask anyone.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.480
No. But somebody at
the party was.

35:08.480 --> 35:09.680
Oh...

35:11.760 --> 35:14.240
..that's where you met.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.160
You are the love that Stanley lost.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.440
I don't know what you are
talking about...

35:19.440 --> 35:22.920
You couldn't bear for him
to go back to prison.

35:22.920 --> 35:28.080
So you took the second shot
and left the rifle to be found.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.840
I think you should leave.

35:29.840 --> 35:34.000
I will not betray your confidence.
You have my word.

35:43.480 --> 35:48.080
I tried. I really did.
I courted so many women

35:48.080 --> 35:50.360
and even the publicity,

35:50.360 --> 35:53.120
so no-one would ever guess who
I truly desired.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.840
He was my English tutor,
and it just felt right.

36:01.240 --> 36:06.280
You disappeared from the party.
I assume you went to find him?

36:06.280 --> 36:08.080
Yes.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.560
What are you doing?

36:13.560 --> 36:15.240
When Stanley was first arrested,

36:15.240 --> 36:19.360
I was terrified
the police would come after me.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.080
But they never did.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.720
And I never dared look at
a man that way again.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.840
Where is your father?

36:26.840 --> 36:28.120
I have no idea.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.640
We need to find him.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.560
Ah. Those consequences you
mentioned.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.480
I'm going to need the negatives.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.560
What?
Don't play me for a fool.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.880
For the photographs you sent
to my wife.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.440
I'll pay you.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.280
And then you never come near my
family ever again.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.560
All right. They're in my car.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.480
Show me.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.440
Father Featherstone, heaven sent.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.520
May I borrow Jude? It's an
emergency.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.040
It's the least I can do.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.920
Your car appears to be missing.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.520
It was never here.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.560
You've got it all wrong, you see.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.400
This is the consequence I was
talking about.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.360
He's been released.

37:52.760 --> 37:56.080
Sergeant, we need to find Lord
Hawthorne as a matter of urgency.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.320
I've just seen him, Father,

37:57.320 --> 38:00.000
driving up towards Chipping Point
with Stanley Buchanan.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.440
I'm going to tell the Inspector.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.800
We'll see you there.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.400
No! Father. Wait.

38:16.320 --> 38:19.920
GRUNTING

38:19.920 --> 38:23.200
Get him off me!

38:25.240 --> 38:29.080
Stanley, I understand now.

38:29.080 --> 38:32.640
Lord Hawthorne didn't just report
your arrest, did he?

38:32.640 --> 38:36.120
What do you mean? Your father must
have known about us.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.520
A few weeks ago, I saw him with the
man who arrested me.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.200
Suddenly it all made sense.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.600
My arrest, the perjury,
he set it up.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.320
And you were protected,

38:44.320 --> 38:46.200
even though the police found
your letters.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.960
I saved you from a life of filth.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.080
And signed your own death warrant.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.400
If you do this you will hang.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.320
Don't you see, Father?

38:54.320 --> 38:57.400
I was always going to hell
with Arthur. Where I belong.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.360
You have much to look forward to.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.800
You know that's not true.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.240
Who do you think got you released?

39:03.240 --> 39:05.040
I shot at him so they would let you
go.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.040
You did what?!
You'll be rid of him now.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.840
Find someone else.
Live a good life.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.360
I don't want anyone else.

39:11.360 --> 39:15.120
Gabe, my body is changing.

39:17.800 --> 39:22.160
I've taken female hormones,
to "cure" me.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.320
But you don't need to be cured.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.560
Stanley, please. Just let him go
and we can be together again.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.520
No son of mine is queer.

39:32.520 --> 39:36.200
Stanley for the sake
of your immortal soul, let him go.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.360
Hasn't he done enough
damage already?

39:40.960 --> 39:42.960
You're not worth it.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.880
Lord Hawthorne.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.080
Given the injustice Stanley has
suffered

40:00.080 --> 40:02.600
perhaps you could overlook
his intemperate...

40:02.600 --> 40:04.320
I will overlook nothing.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.360
You will be excommunicated,

40:06.360 --> 40:07.800
you will be back behind bars

40:07.800 --> 40:10.080
and you will take over
the Enquirer.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.520
I don't think so.

40:12.520 --> 40:15.280
Not when I have quite the story
to tell.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.280
"Lord Hawthorne's adultery shame."

40:18.280 --> 40:20.240
Where's the proof?

40:25.160 --> 40:27.320
Remiss of you not to check, really.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.560
You wouldn't destroy your
own legacy.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.800
After what you've done
to Stanley,

40:31.800 --> 40:33.120
it would be a pleasure.

40:38.880 --> 40:42.320
Lord Hawthorne,
everything all right, Sir?

40:42.320 --> 40:47.320
Just straightening out a little
misunderstanding, that's all.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.640
You're not safe out here without
protection. Let me escort you home.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.080
I don't see the point?

40:52.080 --> 40:55.480
It's abundantly clear
to me that you are useless.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.680
I can't believe you just did that.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.320
Father, how can we ever repay you?

41:05.320 --> 41:07.560
Well, there is just one
small thing.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.640
Why are your bags packed?

41:18.960 --> 41:21.280
Oh, no darling, they're yours.

41:23.800 --> 41:27.920
Those photographs were taken by
a private detective, you see.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.120
I wanted to see how genuine you
were

41:30.120 --> 41:32.000
after your indiscretion.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.280
No, thank you.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.840
I will never be unfaithful again.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.760
It's immaterial now.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.000
I've just been writing my own
column.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.040
It feels so liberating not
to be churning out your hate.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.680
And who's going to publish you?

41:50.680 --> 41:53.080
You, of course.
In the Enquirer.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.880
Don't be ridiculous.

41:54.880 --> 41:58.360
I assume you want me to maintain
a dignified silence?

41:59.880 --> 42:03.120
I know how you hate to become
the story.

42:07.680 --> 42:08.960
It would seem, Father,

42:08.960 --> 42:11.840
that I'm not as incompatible with
the church as I thought.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.720
Thanks to you.

42:13.720 --> 42:17.040
Well, I'm glad to have you back in
the fold.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.440
And Lord Hawthorne?

42:18.440 --> 42:20.600
Has decided not to retire after all.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.040
He's gone back to London.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.560
London? Best place for him.

42:24.560 --> 42:27.560
And you're off to see the world,
I hear?

42:27.560 --> 42:30.560
With my companion.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.400
God be with you.

42:32.400 --> 42:35.480
Once again, Father, I can't tell you
how relieved I am

42:35.480 --> 42:39.080
that this was all a
misunderstanding.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.480
A relief indeed.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.640
All's well that ends...

42:43.640 --> 42:46.840
..well.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.880
Back to Chelsea?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.040
Not for long.

42:52.040 --> 42:54.400
I've decided to set sail
to Swaziland.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.680
Swazi, As a missionary?

42:56.680 --> 42:58.520
You gave me a second chance, Father.

42:58.520 --> 43:01.800
From now on I owe it to God
to help those who need me most.

43:01.800 --> 43:05.000
Well, that's very admirable, indeed.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.080
And I believe someone has a gift
for you.

43:08.080 --> 43:11.760
Oh, yes.
Just a few strawberry scones,

43:11.760 --> 43:13.320
award-winning.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.920
By way of apology for having been
less than welcoming.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.320
How thrilling.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.720
I do hope you'll keep in touch.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.920
Godspeed.

43:21.920 --> 43:22.960
Goodbye. God bless.

43:25.680 --> 43:29.320
I don't think I could handle another
replacement, Father.

43:29.320 --> 43:33.240
I can assure you, Mrs McCarthy, I
have no intention of going anywhere.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.320
Well, that is a relief.

43:35.320 --> 43:37.120
You may not be as...

43:37.120 --> 43:38.960
..as sprightly,

43:38.960 --> 43:41.600
but there's no substitute
for experience.
