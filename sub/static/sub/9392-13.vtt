00:35.536 --> 00:37.102
(muffled):
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker,

00:37.104 --> 00:39.038
and the reason I'm wearing
this mask is because

00:39.040 --> 00:41.640
we've got a Make-A-Wish
kid in the studio tonight,

00:41.642 --> 00:43.709
who, as you'll find out
as the show goes on,

00:43.711 --> 00:45.144
is quite a cougher.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.514
In local news, Mayor West
signed a bill today...
(coughs)

00:48.516 --> 00:49.915
See? That's-that's
what I was talking about.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.117
(continues coughing)

00:52.119 --> 00:53.685
Are we gonna get that,

00:53.687 --> 00:55.587
or are we gonna wait
for commercial?

00:55.589 --> 00:57.823
No, no, you have
to spray it.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.458
You can't just wipe--
look, you know what?

00:59.460 --> 01:01.193
Let's just throw
the whole camera out.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.694
Okay, Joyce,
you talk now.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.097
I-I don't even want
to open my mouth.
You know, Tom,

01:05.099 --> 01:06.532
I haven't seen
you in a mask

01:06.534 --> 01:09.101
since you went
George P. Wilbur.ame

01:09.103 --> 01:11.036
Oh-ho-ho, Joyce,
you know we don't talk

01:11.038 --> 01:12.504
about that on the air.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.539
Oh, my God!

01:13.541 --> 01:14.940
Did she... did
she just say

01:14.942 --> 01:17.543
that George P. Wilbur was
Tom Tucker's stage name?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.478
Who the hell
is George P. Wilbur?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.181
That's the guy who played
Michael Myers in <i>Halloween 4,</i>

01:22.183 --> 01:24.349
the greatest movie
of all time.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.452
I've only seen that movie
about a thousand times.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.087
How could I not
have noticed that?

01:28.089 --> 01:29.688
(screaming)

01:29.690 --> 01:30.956
(crying)

01:30.958 --> 01:34.493
(continues screaming)

01:34.495 --> 01:36.929
(sobbing)

01:36.931 --> 01:38.297
TOM:
Good evening. I'm Michael Myers.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.932
I have enormous
psychological problems,

01:39.934 --> 01:42.701
and I'm going
to take them out on you.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.636
It   <i>i</i>him. I
can't believe it.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.472
I mean, that's, like,
my favorite movie ever!

01:46.474 --> 01:49.475
I thought <i>The Flintstones</i>
<i>your favorite movie.</i>

01:49.477 --> 01:51.276
No, that's my
favorite period piece.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.178
Well, that and <i>Good</i>
<i>Night and Good Luck.</i>

01:53.180 --> 01:55.114
Even though I was tricked
into leaving early.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.082
Good night and good luck.

01:57.084 --> 02:00.185
And good night
and good luck to you, sir.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.991
Oh, hi, Chris.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.426
How was school?

02:07.428 --> 02:09.428
It was great.
I met a girl, Mom!

02:09.430 --> 02:11.130
That's wonderful, honey.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.132
Yeah, her name is
Lindsey, like the state.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.968
Is she nice?
Yeah, she's really
nice and super pretty,

02:15.970 --> 02:17.970
and her bicycle seat
smells like strawberries.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.806
Oh. Okay.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.975
I'm gonna go upstairs
and alternate between

02:22.977 --> 02:26.712
hopeful excitement
and suicidal pessimism!

02:30.950 --> 02:33.152
(sighs)
Got to get the energy up.

02:36.422 --> 02:37.956
Found it.
(knocking)

02:37.958 --> 02:39.925
Hey, uh, excuse
me, Mr. Tucker.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.995
You got a second?
Oh, hello, Peter.
Sure, come on in.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.964
Thanks. Um, hey, listen,
you were the guy that

02:45.966 --> 02:48.300
who played Michael Myers
in   <i>Halloween 4,</i>

02:48.302 --> 02:51.436
and I just want to say,
brilliant performance ever

02:51.438 --> 02:52.938
in the history
of everything,

02:52.940 --> 02:55.374
and I wanted to see
if you would sign my DVD.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.376
Oh, I suppose.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.877
Thanks. Hey, so,
what happened?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.013
How come you never
did any more movies?

03:01.015 --> 03:03.081
Well, I tried to
make a career out
there in Hollywood,

03:03.083 --> 03:05.684
but I just didn't realize
how tough acting is.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.019
Well, you know
what they say--

03:07.021 --> 03:08.287
"Tough actin' Tinactin."

03:08.289 --> 03:10.122
I wish I'd
known that then.

03:10.124 --> 03:13.192
You see, life after
<i>Halloween 4</i> wasn't
exactly smooth sailing.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.194
Once I stepped out
from behind that mask,

03:15.196 --> 03:18.063
Hollywood gave me
the cold shoulder.

03:19.098 --> 03:21.266
TOM:
<i>The work I did manage to get</i>

03:21.268 --> 03:24.503
<i>was usually just bit parts</i>
<i>that didn't last too long.</i>

03:24.505 --> 03:27.172
<i>Like the role of Denise's</i>
<i>boyfriend on</i> The Cosby Show.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.807
It's nice
to meet you, Martin.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.108
Thank you,
Mrs. Huxtable.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.010
So, if you guys
are a family,

03:32.012 --> 03:34.313
why are none of you
the same shade of black?

03:34.315 --> 03:37.683
<i>I was also coked out</i>
<i>of my skull most of the time.</i>

03:37.685 --> 03:40.419
<i>But whatever the case,</i>
<i>I was done.</i>

03:41.754 --> 03:44.189
I left Hollywood, moved back
to my hometown of Quahog,

03:44.191 --> 03:46.658
and wound up working
here as a news anchor.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.927
Wow. Well,
don't you miss it?

03:48.929 --> 03:51.964
Every second of every day,
but I can't touch coke again.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.465
It would ruin my life.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.266
No, I mean acting.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.667
Oh. Of course.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.370
But it's over for me.
That's all in the past.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.273
Well, if you ask
me, you got the
makings of a star.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.109
And I want to help
you get there.
Well, that's
a nice offer,

04:04.111 --> 04:06.278
but I'm not quite sure
how you expect to do that.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.614
Well, you've brought me
so much joy over the years

04:08.616 --> 04:10.182
as that lovable
murderer of teenagers,

04:10.184 --> 04:12.117
and I want to
return the favor.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.685
I don't even have
an agent anymore.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.021
Well, then how about this?
I'll be your agent.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.624
You?
Yeah, I've seen every
episode of <i>Entourage.</i>

04:18.626 --> 04:20.158
All you need is
some fake hair

04:20.160 --> 04:22.027
and a bunch of Hobbits
hanging around you.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.029
You're on in five
minutes, Mr. Tucker.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.030
You don't belong here.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.431
You're better than this.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.267
You're <i>Halloween 4</i> better.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.835
Look, I appreciate
your offer,

04:29.837 --> 04:31.803
but I've got a pretty
good thing going here.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.707
In a few minutes,
I've got to be on camera
in front of <i>800</i> people.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.447
Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.117
Our top story tonight: The
Rhode Island Historical Society

04:45.119 --> 04:48.320
is heralding the arrival
of a cast-iron, oak-handled

04:48.322 --> 04:49.921
Colonial bedsheet warmer,

04:49.923 --> 04:52.424
now on display
in the Statehouse Rotunda.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.026
TOM:
<i>Okay, there it is.</i>

04:54.028 --> 04:57.929
<i>As I understand it, they would</i>
<i>put the coal inside of that,</i>

04:57.931 --> 05:01.133
<i>and then put the object</i>
<i>between the sheets.</i>

05:01.135 --> 05:03.201
<i>It was very cold back then.</i>

05:03.203 --> 05:05.370
<i>And it would warm the sheets.</i>

05:06.939 --> 05:09.041
<i>And I-I think that's</i>
<i>the gist of it.</i>

05:09.043 --> 05:11.109
<i>How much footage</i>
<i>of this do we have?</i>

05:11.111 --> 05:12.778
<i>Oh-oh, this is live.</i>

05:12.780 --> 05:14.046
<i>This... Can-can she hear me?</i>

05:14.048 --> 05:16.348
<i>Okay, you can put it down now.</i>

05:16.350 --> 05:19.151
You... She can't <i>hear me. Okay.</i>

05:20.486 --> 05:22.487
What the hell is going on here?

05:22.489 --> 05:25.257
<i>Is it... is it...</i>
<i>Am I having a stroke?</i>

05:27.193 --> 05:28.827
Wait, Peter! Don't go!

05:28.829 --> 05:30.762
So, you changed
your mind, huh, buddy?

05:30.764 --> 05:32.197
We going to Hollywood?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.032
You betcha.
But I have to say,

05:34.034 --> 05:37.102
I thought you'd
drive a fancier car.
What? Why?

05:37.104 --> 05:39.871
Well, aren't you
the Peter Griffin of
Peter Griffin Cadillac?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.006
No, that's another guy.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.108
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin,

05:43.110 --> 05:46.144
and at Peter Griffin Cadillac,
we believe in three things:

05:46.146 --> 05:48.880
fair dealing, family,
and friendship.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.849
I've lived in Quahog
my whole life.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.017
I love it here.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.619
And you're gonna love
a Peter Griffin Cadillac.

05:54.621 --> 05:55.921
Scumbag.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.830
All right, Lois,
remember to feed the cat,
and remember to get a cat.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.932
I still don't understand
why you got to go

06:06.934 --> 06:08.300
all the way
to Hollywood.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.669
Because I know
Tom Tucker could
be a great actor,

06:10.671 --> 06:12.838
and I'm gonna help him
make it happen.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.773
You see, everybody
needs just one person

06:14.775 --> 06:16.141
to believe in
their dreams

06:16.143 --> 06:18.777
so they can spread
their wings and fly.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.379
Dad, can I have money
for dance classes?

06:20.381 --> 06:22.013
Sit down, you
dumpy bread loaf.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.448
I'd pay to see
you    <i>n</i>dance.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.317
When will
you be back?
I don't know.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.918
But I'll be sure
to be back

06:26.920 --> 06:28.620
before Chris's big
dance class recital.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.988
I believe
in that boy.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.656
I don't want
to dance!

06:31.658 --> 06:33.058
You'll dance!

06:40.700 --> 06:42.134
Boy, I don't
know, Peter,

06:42.136 --> 06:44.269
being back out
here makes me
kind of nervous.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.837
Maybe-maybe this
was all a mistake.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.506
Don't be silly, Tom--
you're an actor,

06:47.508 --> 06:49.007
and this is
where you belong.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.210
Now, let's take some of
this complimentary luggage
and get going.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.947
Well, so, h-how
do we do this?

06:55.949 --> 06:58.750
You do nothing.
You just sit back
and let your agent

06:58.752 --> 07:02.020
knock on every door in
Hollywood till he gets
you an acting job.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.689
And that starts right now.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.458
Yes? C-Can
I help you?

07:06.460 --> 07:07.993
No, but I can help you.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.661
You need to hire this man.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.130
Oh. Um, okay.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.434
Well, do you have
any experience
handling bags?

07:15.436 --> 07:17.002
Aha! I see!

07:17.004 --> 07:18.603
Typical casting-couch stuff.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.672
All right, kid,
you want to make it

07:20.674 --> 07:22.340
in showbiz
or don't you?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.848
I thought the airport
was Hollywood.

07:34.587 --> 07:38.156
Hey, Mom, I want you to
meet my new girlfriend.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.257
New girlfriend?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.759
Yeah, you remember that girl

07:40.761 --> 07:41.960
Lindsey I told you about?

07:41.962 --> 07:45.497
Well, I asked her out,
and now we are dating.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.767
Lindsey, this is my mom,
my little brother Stewie,

07:48.769 --> 07:50.602
and my dog Brian.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.470
Hey.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.839
Oh, my God.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.207
My goodness,
look at you.

07:55.209 --> 07:58.610
Do you even realize
who you look like?

07:58.612 --> 07:59.945
Cameron Diaz,
that's who.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.313
You are gorgeous!

08:01.315 --> 08:04.015
Well, she's
awful pretty-- I
know <i>that,</i> Mom.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.451
Very pretty.
Stunning.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.786
Are you kidding me?

08:07.788 --> 08:08.987
Are they not seeing this?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.655
I know, it's kind of creepy.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.757
It's almost like
he's dating Lois.
Yeah.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.826
Looks like somebody's
getting a little Oedipus-y.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.195
Can we say that?
Just did.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.334
All right, Tom, this is
totally gonna work.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.035
All the biggest Hollywood
players eat here,

08:24.037 --> 08:26.872
and we just got
to make them think
we're one of them.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.274
That's why I got these
old Hollywood Jew glasses.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.375
Waiter! Oh, waiter!

08:30.377 --> 08:32.377
Yes sir.
Are you gentlemen
ready to order?

08:32.379 --> 08:35.547
Yes, I will have
the Big and Fancy,
and my client here

08:35.549 --> 08:38.350
will have a bottle
of your best steak.
Right away, sir.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.118
Peter, I-I'm not sure
what any of this

08:40.120 --> 08:43.188
has to do with
getting me acting jobs.
Tom, who's the agent here?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.090
You are.
And who is the actor?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.525
Well, I am.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.860
Wait, which one
am I again?
The agent.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.329
And who's paying
for dinner?
I assumed you were.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.798
Ah, then we best load
our pockets with bread

08:53.800 --> 08:56.368
and get the hell
out of here.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.602
We have to go!

08:57.604 --> 09:00.138
Not expensive enough!

09:00.140 --> 09:02.774
Excuse me, I
couldn't help but
notice your glasses,

09:02.776 --> 09:06.111
your poor table
manners and your huge
sense of entitlement.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.445
Are you an agent?
I am.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.915
You've got ten seconds
to dazzle me. Go.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.450
Well, I'm the casting
director for <i>NCIS,</i>

09:12.452 --> 09:15.353
and we need an actor
for a small role that
shoots tomorrow.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.122
This is your man.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.190
That's great! He's
got just the look
we're after.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.826
Show up here at
10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

09:21.828 --> 09:22.994
How about that, huh, Tom?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.462
You're back in
the business.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.197
Wow, Peter,
I can't believe it!

09:26.199 --> 09:27.599
Hey, don't be
so surprised.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.668
I've been pounding the
pavement for you, buddy.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.803
I even gave out all
my business cards.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.372
Call me! Call me! Call me!

09:34.374 --> 09:37.008
Call me! Call me!
Call me! Call me!

09:37.010 --> 09:40.011
Ah, show business.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.450
Oh, hi, you two.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.019
You know, Lindsey,
I just want to say
how nice it is

09:48.021 --> 09:50.455
to have such
a beautiful young
woman in our home.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.590
Oh, a baby.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.325
I almost had one
of you twice.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.961
(laughs)
Who didn't, right?

09:55.963 --> 09:58.129
So, what are you
two up to tonight?

09:58.131 --> 10:00.031
Well, we really
haven't decided yet.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.100
Eh, I'll think
of something
while I'm taking

10:02.102 --> 10:03.935
a chick dump in your
parents' bathroom.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.705
And I will
hold your purse.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.039
Good for Chris, huh?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.708
He picked a
peach, didn't he?

10:09.710 --> 10:12.777
Lois, don't you think maybe part
of the reason you like Lindsey

10:12.779 --> 10:14.946
could be because she
looks so much like you?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.482
(chuckles): What? What
are you talking about?

10:17.484 --> 10:19.017
Come on, she's clearly
an awful person.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.119
And I think it's possible
that your vanity

10:21.121 --> 10:22.988
has made you
a little blind to that.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.824
Oh... I see what's
going on here-- you're jealous.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.326
Chris has a wonderful
young woman in his life,

10:28.328 --> 10:29.861
and you've got nothing.

10:29.863 --> 10:30.929
She's kind of
right, Brian.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.964
All you've got is
a worn-out rope toy

10:32.966 --> 10:36.267
and that squirrel
who comes by once a
day to taunt you.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.470
(rustling in brush)
Hey!

10:38.472 --> 10:40.705
Hey, get out of here!
This is our yard!

10:40.707 --> 10:42.607
You don't belong there!
Don't you touch anything!

10:42.609 --> 10:44.109
I told you all this yesterday!

10:55.021 --> 10:58.156
To your first big
TV acting job.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.358
MALE TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return to</i> NCIS.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.494
Oh, here it is.
Here comes my part.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.030
Excuse me.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.798
I'm looking for
Ed Manzelli.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.500
Good evening.
I'm Ed Manzelli.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.968
What can I do for you?

11:09.970 --> 11:12.270
I'm looking for a guy
who used to work here.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.305
Name's Mario.
Got any idea where he could be?

11:14.307 --> 11:16.274
I haven't seen him
in over a month.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.009
That's the end of my line.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.011
Your line, <i>NCIS.</i>

11:20.013 --> 11:22.847
You son of a bitch,
you made me feel again.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.250
Oh, don't you go
'cause I'll go.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.852
You know, Peter, I
just want to thank you

11:27.854 --> 11:29.254
for all you've
done for me.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.122
You... You are one
hell of an agent.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.991
Well, with you
as a client, it's easy.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.192
WOMAN (over intercom):
Mr. Griffin?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.760
Yes, Sandra?
You have a secretary?

11:35.762 --> 11:37.696
She calls herself
an assistant, but yes.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.930
What is it, Sandra?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.498
There's a man
here to see you.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.334
He says he wants to talk
to you about being his agent.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.537
Really?! Well, then,
by all means, send him in!

11:45.539 --> 11:46.938
Hey, knucklebutts!

11:46.940 --> 11:49.374
BOTH (gasp):
James Woods?!

11:49.376 --> 11:50.942
But I... I don't understand!

11:50.944 --> 11:52.811
I... I thought you were dead!

11:52.813 --> 11:54.312
Well... (chuckles)
I'm not.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.513
I don't believe you.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.948
God, is that true?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.450
God?

11:58.452 --> 12:01.119
God, are you there?

12:01.121 --> 12:04.189
(music playing
through headphones)

12:06.959 --> 12:10.228
Come on, don't touch yourself.
You're God.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.969
I-I don't get it.
Last time we saw you,

12:17.971 --> 12:21.005
Diane Simmons had just stabbed
you in the back with a knife.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.208
Yeah! How the hell
did you come back to life?!

12:23.210 --> 12:24.642
Well, gentlemen,

12:24.644 --> 12:27.712
sometimes being a big Hollywood
star has its advantages.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.753
Hey, is this guy somebody?

12:34.755 --> 12:36.354
Yeah, that's James Woods!

12:36.356 --> 12:37.756
We got a celebrity here!

12:37.758 --> 12:39.958
I repeat, this is not
a normal dead person!

12:39.960 --> 12:41.025
This is a celebrity!

12:43.095 --> 12:44.963
JAMES: <i>Being a famous movie star</i>
<i>entitled me</i>

12:44.965 --> 12:46.765
<i>to topnotch medical care</i>

12:46.767 --> 12:50.034
<i>not available</i>
<i>to the rest of society.</i>

12:50.036 --> 12:52.804
<i>My body was immediately taken</i>
<i>to a Hollywood hospital,</i>

12:52.806 --> 12:56.775
<i>where I was hooked up</i>
<i>to a 17-year-old ingenue.</i>

12:58.844 --> 13:01.045
<i>And in accordance</i>
<i>with Hollywood law,</i>

13:01.047 --> 13:03.014
<i>her life force was infused</i>
<i>into me,</i>

13:03.016 --> 13:05.483
bringing me back from the dead.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.252
TOM:
<i>What happened to the girl?</i>

13:07.254 --> 13:09.721
JAMES:
<i>I threw her out a car window</i>
<i>at Nora Ephron.</i>

13:11.690 --> 13:13.358
Stop making
Jack Nicholson a pansy!

13:13.360 --> 13:15.260
You're thinking of Nancy Meyers!

13:15.262 --> 13:17.195
You're the same thing!

13:17.197 --> 13:18.763
Wow. That's amazing.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.932
So, what do you say, Peter?
Will you be my agent?

13:20.934 --> 13:22.467
I don't get it.
Why would a big shot

13:22.469 --> 13:23.935
like you want me for an agent?

13:23.937 --> 13:26.004
Because you're an up-and-comer,
because you're hungry.

13:26.006 --> 13:26.971
I am hungry.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.773
But you put me
and my family

13:28.775 --> 13:30.608
through a lot of
crap over the years.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.143
Why would I want
to help you?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.344
Well, because
you're my agent.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.113
Oh, my God, you're
right! I am!

13:35.115 --> 13:37.916
You came out here
to be <i>my</i> agent.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.984
Tom, relax,
I can take care of you both.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.653
You'd be surprised
how much I can handle.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.489
Peter, I need you to drop
Stewie off at day care,

13:44.491 --> 13:46.991
and then shred this big
stack of old bank statements.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.893
You got it, Lois.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.897
Is he always
this quiet?

13:55.868 --> 13:58.837
So, Kevin made another attempt
on his life last night.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.872
He drank two bottles
of dish soap.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.473
Well, we have
some news, too.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.043
Chris is dating the
most wonderful girl.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.812
You know, everyone said, "Don't
smoke during your pregnancy,"

14:07.814 --> 14:10.982
but I think some of it rubbed
off on him 'cause now he's cool.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.517
That's nice.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.085
Well, I should go, Lois.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.921
Yeah, I should probably
get going myself.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.556
Oh, my God!

14:21.327 --> 14:22.961
What? What is it, Lois?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.095
That girl over there--

14:24.097 --> 14:26.097
that... that's
Chris's girlfriend!

14:26.099 --> 14:28.967
Hey, you know, she kind of
looks like you, Lois.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.102
Maybe <i>she'll</i> thank me
for buying the coffee.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.371
You think she
looks like me, too?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.006
Oh, my God.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.108
I'm starting to
think Brian was right.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.111
Maybe I have been blinded
by my own stupid vanity.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.946
That girl is
nothing but trouble.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.982
Are you gonna tell Chris?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.617
I guess I'll have to,

14:45.619 --> 14:47.952
but he doesn't take
bad news very well.

14:47.954 --> 14:51.089
Oh, Chris, honey,
I'm so sorry to tell you this,

14:51.091 --> 14:53.491
but your grandfather died.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.826
(gasping and hissing)

14:54.828 --> 14:55.960
(screaming)

14:55.962 --> 14:58.863
(yelling)

15:02.101 --> 15:03.301
All right, gentlemen.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.136
So, what do you got
for my client?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.938
Well, we're making a
mediocre action film,

15:06.940 --> 15:09.774
and we think James is just the
guy to do a serviceable job

15:09.776 --> 15:12.510
in a supporting role that
Jeremy Irons, Jeff Goldblum,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.646
and Craig T. Nelson
have already passed on.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.081
Well, we'd need
to see a script first.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.016
Oh, looks good.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.350
What do you think, James?

15:19.352 --> 15:20.618
I like it.
Good.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.920
I say we move on this.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.288
All right, then,
let's negotiate.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.956
We want everything.
We'll give
you nothing.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.158
We want something.
Deal.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.694
(phone ringing)

15:31.363 --> 15:33.464
Ugh, not this hillbilly
from Rhode Island again.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.800
No thank you.
(beep)

15:35.802 --> 15:37.302
This is Peter Griffin,
famous agent,

15:37.304 --> 15:38.937
but you can call me PG-13.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.171
Ba-boom!

15:40.173 --> 15:41.606
Leave a message.
(beep)

15:41.608 --> 15:42.974
Hi, Peter, it's Tom.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.709
Uh, just trying
to reach you again.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.210
And you know,
about that meeting

15:46.212 --> 15:48.246
you set up with me
and Heath Ledger...

15:48.248 --> 15:49.914
He... He never showed.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.483
Maybe I was at the wrong
Panda Express, but I...

15:52.485 --> 15:55.086
Anyway, uh, call me back.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.991
Hey, listen, thanks for
inviting me to lunch, Peter.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.426
I-I was starting
to get nervous

16:01.428 --> 16:02.961
when you weren't
returning my calls.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.797
Tom, I... I didn't know
how to say this to you,

16:05.799 --> 16:07.498
so, here,
take this piece of paper.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.302
And you're on in four,
three, two...

16:11.304 --> 16:13.805
"Peter Griffin drops Tom Tucker
as a client."

16:13.807 --> 16:16.174
You're-you're dropping me
as a client?

16:16.176 --> 16:17.675
Yeah, just heard it
on the news.

16:17.677 --> 16:18.943
How could you do this?!

16:18.945 --> 16:20.345
Look, it's a whole
different landscape

16:20.347 --> 16:21.579
out here since Thursday.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.081
Everything's on computers now.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.083
Peter, I left a very
good job for this!

16:25.085 --> 16:27.018
You're the only reason
I came back out here!

16:27.020 --> 16:28.453
I wish I could help you, Tom,

16:28.455 --> 16:29.821
but this is coming
from upstairs.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.022
The karate studio?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.590
Tom, I have to go now.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.060
But if you're ever Kevin James,
I want you to give me a call.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.833
(phone ringing and buzzing)

16:41.835 --> 16:43.134
Mm. Hello?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.969
Peter, it's me, Woodsy!
I need a favor.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.505
What?! It's, like, 2:00 a.m.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.207
Yeah, so listen, I'm
at Chateau Marmont,

16:49.209 --> 16:50.975
I just met this
18-year-old chick,

16:50.977 --> 16:53.044
and I can't decide
whether to take her home

16:53.046 --> 16:55.013
or keep doing blow
with Tom Sizemore

16:55.015 --> 16:57.582
and see if I can do
better later in the night.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.850
Well, okay, um...

16:58.852 --> 17:00.184
Do, uh, do-do you love her?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.587
What?! Look, I'm
texting you her picture.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.323
Just tell me if you
think she's hot enough.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.791
(phone chirps)

17:06.793 --> 17:08.860
I... What is this
a picture of?

17:08.862 --> 17:11.129
Is that the bottom
of a white pumpkin?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.497
Is she hot or not?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.132
I-I guess.
Okay, good, great.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.135
So clear out of your apartment;
we're gonna be there in 15.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.136
What?! I'm sleeping.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.971
Why can't you bring her
to your place?

17:19.973 --> 17:21.339
I don't know, man.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.074
It's my aunt's
daughter. It's weird.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.580
Chris, honey,

17:29.582 --> 17:31.749
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.017
Why, sure, Mom. Come on in.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.086
Chris, you know
your girlfriend, Lindsey?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.320
Yeah.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.322
Well, honey,

17:38.324 --> 17:40.925
I saw her making out
with another boy.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.261
Was she kissing with her mouth,
or her pants-mouth?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.529
Because she does both.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.931
Chris, I can't believe
you knew about this!

17:46.933 --> 17:48.332
That's terrible!

17:48.334 --> 17:50.701
Why would you even date
a girl like that?

17:50.703 --> 17:54.038
Well, because...
I-I thought she'd be like you.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.139
Like me?

17:55.141 --> 17:56.474
Well, you got to admit, Mom,

17:56.476 --> 17:58.643
she does look a lot like you.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.446
I mean, I just look at
you and Dad, you know?

18:01.448 --> 18:04.248
He's a complete train wreck,
and you put up with him.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.284
And I'm no prize myself.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.954
So, I guess I figured if I don't
find a girl just like you,

18:09.956 --> 18:11.956
I might never find anyone.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.858
Oh, Chris.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.660
Of course you'll find someone.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.961
And you <i>are</i> a prize.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.263
You're a handsome,
kind-hearted, young man,

18:19.265 --> 18:22.200
and any girl would be lucky
to have you in her life.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.668
You really think so?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.369
Of course I do, sweetheart.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.438
Thanks, Mom.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.042
Now I'm gonna take the child
filter off the computer,

18:31.044 --> 18:33.411
and I want you
to have a fun night.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.016
Okay, this is it, James.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.085
I got your next
project right here.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.821
Peter, you've pitched me
dozens of projects,

18:43.823 --> 18:46.791
and all of them involve me
playing a hayride driver.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.926
I don't know, I just
see you doing that.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.362
You know, this year, it's
vampires, next year, it's hay.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.663
These things go in cycles.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.966
Peter, this is probably
a good time to fire you.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.168
What?!
Come on, Peter,
who are we kidding?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.137
You're a one-man operation.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.838
You know me.
I need a whole crew.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.774
I need a drugs guy,
a girls guy, a fitness guy,

19:03.776 --> 19:07.145
a guy with a boat who can dump
stuff way-out-there kind of guy.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.813
But... But you're
my only client!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.114
Without you, I'm ruined!

19:10.116 --> 19:11.449
Well, that's show business.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.585
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to answer this fake phone call.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.987
Hello? Grimace
from McDonald's?

19:15.989 --> 19:17.989
Sorry, Peter,
I got to take this.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.423
No, I understand.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.195
(knocking)

19:25.998 --> 19:27.165
Hey, Tom.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.000
How you doing?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.168
What do <i>you</i> want?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.869
James Woods fired me.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.005
Listen, I-I been thinking.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.107
I was a real jerk to you.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.675
I dragged you out here,

19:37.677 --> 19:40.178
only to dump you
when you needed me the most.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.445
I guess what I'm saying is,

19:41.447 --> 19:43.648
I'm really sorry
about everything.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.183
Sorry doesn't
cut it, Peter.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.952
I quit my job, I left everything
behind to come out here.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.787
I know, but I was
just trying to help.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.122
I never wanted to let you down.

19:51.124 --> 19:54.992
Well, I suppose your only crime
is that you believed in me.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.528
And then stopped believing
in me rather abruptly.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.963
So what do you say?

19:58.965 --> 20:00.932
You ready to go back
to where we both belong?

20:00.934 --> 20:03.701
Yup. Let's go home.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.136
Sounds good.

20:05.138 --> 20:07.939
Hey, check out this picture
James Woods texted me.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.775
What is that? A balloon
running out of air?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.777
Yeah, see, I was hoping
you would know.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.778
(snaps fingers)

20:13.780 --> 20:15.446
It's his cousin's anus.

20:19.451 --> 20:20.918
Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.420
And I'm Joyce Kinney.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.823
Tom, I think I speak for all of
us here at Channel Five News

20:25.825 --> 20:27.992
when I say it's good
to have you back here

20:27.994 --> 20:29.293
at half your
original salary.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.528
Still twice yours, Joyce.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.963
Our top story tonight:

20:31.965 --> 20:34.298
Quahog's first organic
supermarket opens this weekend.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.534
So head on down
before the gays turn it

20:36.536 --> 20:39.103
into a cruising ground like
they did the Barnes and Noble

20:39.105 --> 20:41.272
upstairs coffee bar,
which they had to close.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.708
Well, I'm just happy
Tom got his job back.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.943
But I'm sorry I missed meeting
your girlfriend, Chris.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.378
That's okay, Dad.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.913
Yeah, Chris, I
never asked you.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.148
What did Lindsey say when
you broke up with her?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.950
Oh, she didn't seem to mind.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.986
I think she already moved on
to someone else.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.687
Thanks for buying me
these clothes, Glenn.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.089
You're welcome.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.090
And you're dismissed.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.092
Do I still get
to keep the 20?

21:04.296 --> 21:08.366
