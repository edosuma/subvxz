[sound effect playing]

00:03.737 --> 00:06.040
[music playing]

00:11.412 --> 00:13.681
What did the doctor say?

00:13.714 --> 00:15.116
Let's not talk
about it right now.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.984
Oh my god.
It's cancer.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.619
You're 44 years old
and you have cancer.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.588
It's not cancer.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.356
It's just a little
cyst in my armpit.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.758
It's like a-- a big pimple.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.995
You're 44 and
you have a pimple.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.497
It's going to be all right.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.165
I just have to rub
cream on it every day

00:31.199 --> 00:34.335
right after I prepare the area.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.539
Prepare the area how?

00:38.572 --> 00:39.640
What are you going to do?

00:39.673 --> 00:41.642
You're not going to
start washing, are you?

00:41.675 --> 00:46.280
I have to shave off all
the hair under my arms.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.215
Oh, honey.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.283
It's your very
first lady shaver.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.421
Pretty soon you'll start
getting monthly visits

00:53.454 --> 00:55.689
from your friend.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.057
Cut it out.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.660
It's bad enough I got to shave
under my arms like a woman.

00:59.693 --> 01:03.063
Well, you know, they say it
is best to live as a woman first

01:03.097 --> 01:05.299
before you have the operation.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.734
Cut it out.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.170
And I don't want you
telling anybody about this.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.572
Some things are best left
between a husband and a wife.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.606
Well, right.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.908
Which one do you want to be?

01:14.942 --> 01:16.744
[laughing]

01:17.811 --> 01:19.613
Hey, kids, dinner!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.084
Isn't DJ eating?

01:24.118 --> 01:26.320
No, he's staying over
at a friend's house.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.689
And I like him to
be good and hungry

01:28.722 --> 01:31.659
when he's getting free food.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.927
Mom, Mark is really sick.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.863
When are we going to get the
upstairs bathroom fixed so he

01:35.896 --> 01:37.131
doesn't have to come down here?

01:37.165 --> 01:42.069
As soon as we finish the
guitar shaped swimming pool.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.837
Man, this thing
I got is the worst.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.439
I feel like I'm going to die.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.111
Wouldn't you just be
more comfortable sitting

01:51.145 --> 01:54.382
on my plate?

01:54.415 --> 01:56.617
Mom, I got to
start school tomorrow

01:56.650 --> 01:57.851
and I really need my rest.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.453
Is it all right if Mark
stays on the couch tonight?

01:59.487 --> 02:00.421
No.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.355
I don't want anybody
sick in there.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.824
That couch smells bad already.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.494
Well, where's he going to go?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.028
Well, DJ's gone.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.564
So we'll take David
out of his room.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.734
And put Mark in there, and
then move David to the couch.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.135
Done.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.405
Wait, what does
the couch smell like?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.573
The family.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.475
[laughing]

02:21.509 --> 02:23.277
Where's dinner, we're hungry.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.912
Ours is on our plates.

02:24.945 --> 02:29.883
But you told me you were eating
over at, uh, that kid's house.

02:29.917 --> 02:33.787
No, Mom, I told you yesterday,
Ralph is staying over here.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.123
Well, I'm sorry, Ralph,
but you can't stay here.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.027
You'll have to tell your parents
that Mr. Conner's on a bender.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.395
You can't do that.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.763
His parents are out of town.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.266
And you promised I could
have friends sleep over.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.667
Well I didn't mean it.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.102
I thought you were just bluffing
when you said you had a friend.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.238
[laughing]

02:50.271 --> 02:52.373
Mrs. Conner, Ralph and
DJ can take the couch.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.608
I'll just move down in
the basement with Darlene.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.611
Oh, yeah, and why don't
you just bang on the ceiling

02:57.645 --> 03:00.381
if you have trouble
fastening her bra?

03:00.414 --> 03:01.282
Cool.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.182
I thought you'd say no.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.317
She did.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.985
Why don't we just stick
Mark in the basement,

03:05.018 --> 03:05.986
and Darlene can sleep with me.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.388
Oh, forget it.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.457
I can't sleep with the sound of
air whistling through her head.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.993
Mark's got to go somewhere.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.127
And he can't sleep with me.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.028
OK.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.430
Let's try this one more time.

03:16.464 --> 03:21.835
Ralph and DJ in the basement,
you on the couch, and you boys

03:21.869 --> 03:23.036
can be in DJ's room.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.005
Wait, why do I
get stuck with Mark?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.407
I can't afford to get sick.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.309
God, everyone's so afraid
I'm going to make them

03:28.342 --> 03:31.312
sick no one will come near me.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.547
I feel like a leopard.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.783
Mark,

03:36.850 --> 03:37.718
I'm sorry.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.819
You didn't mean to get sick.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.121
Everyone refusing to
get near you is unfair.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.856
- You mean that?
- Yeah I do.

03:42.890 --> 03:43.757
I'll share a room with you.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.692
I'm not afraid.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.893
Wow.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.429
It's really touching you'd
say a thing like that.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.665
It's really good
to have a brother.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.134
[laughing]

03:54.167 --> 03:56.570
[theme music]

04:38.912 --> 04:41.349
[laughing]

04:41.382 --> 04:43.784
[music playing]

04:47.355 --> 04:49.189
OK, honey, turn off the light.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.290
No.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.625
I want to see.
- Nothing to see.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.526
Just skin.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.428
Turn off the light.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.563
Oh, come on, Dan.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.698
A lot of guys don't have
hair under their arms.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.799
Like, who?

04:58.832 --> 05:01.034
Oh, like, weightlifters
shave all theirs off

05:01.068 --> 05:03.003
so their muscles show.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.373
Oh, yeah?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.774
[laughing]

05:06.807 --> 05:09.309
Of course, they
also life weights.

05:09.343 --> 05:12.380
Well, I would, but with
the loss of my armpit hair

05:12.413 --> 05:15.115
went my super strength.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.183
Oh come on, let me see.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.485
What are you so
embarrassed about?

05:17.518 --> 05:20.220
You can always just come the
hair from your chest over.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.197
Well, I learned one new thing.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.331
No aftershave next time.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.603
Well, you only had one cyst.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.237
Why did you shave both of them?

05:37.270 --> 05:40.107
Well, one arm just
seemed so unbalanced.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.278
I think it's kind of sexy.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.047
Now I see why you
get so excited when

05:47.080 --> 05:49.750
I shave my legs every month.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.018
Really?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.853
Yeah.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.755
Gee, I don't think I've been
this turned on since you

05:54.788 --> 05:57.591
clipped your nose hairs.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.027
Oh, you know I shaved
a special spot for you.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.028
Ew, gross.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.565
No, no, higher, higher.

06:04.598 --> 06:08.769
Oh Dan, you have
two eyebrows again!

06:08.802 --> 06:10.771
Want some razor burn?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.974
No, all that skin scares me.
[growling]

06:14.007 --> 06:16.477
Let's wait an hour
till it grows back.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.377
[barking]

06:17.411 --> 06:18.446
Oh.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.713
My weakness.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.548
Animal noises.

06:23.183 --> 06:26.386
DAVID: Well, uh, here I am
David, in the only working

06:26.420 --> 06:27.721
bathroom, right next door.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.225
Great.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.326
Mark gave it to David.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.096
Now he's going to be in
there puking all night.

06:36.129 --> 06:36.997
Oh yeah.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.198
Say that again real slow.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.100
I'm getting hot.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.704
DAVID: Uh, thank goodness
I'm not sick like Mark.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.273
I'll just do my business
quickly then skedaddle.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.376
[growling]
[barking]

06:49.409 --> 06:50.410
Cut it out.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.845
I cannot do it with
David in there.

06:51.879 --> 06:52.680
This bed squeaks.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.984
Let's do it on the floor.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.253
You know, Dan, that always
sounds like a lot more fun

07:00.287 --> 07:01.555
than it actually is.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.956
Come on, baby, let's
see if we can make

07:02.990 --> 07:06.460
that floor squeak in China.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.828
[laughing]

07:07.861 --> 07:08.929
DAVID: Hey!

07:08.962 --> 07:10.130
DJ: Hey, you should
have locked the door.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.031
DAVID: It's broken.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.399
DJ: Just hurry up, OK?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.701
I got to pee worse than you.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.202
DAVID: How could you
possibly know that?

07:15.235 --> 07:19.306
Hey, in one minute,
nobody's peeing.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.609
Go on, baby.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.443
Come on down here where
the cedar chest used to be.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.779
It's still fluffy.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.016
I can't do it with
people in the next room.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.584
Since when does
a crowd bother you?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.819
We did it at a
Grateful Dead concert.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.624
That was nearly
two years ago Dan.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.993
I think we've grown up
a little since then.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.662
Honey, we've got to face it.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.430
There's just too many
people in this house.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.397
Now, we've done our job.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.233
We deserve a little
peace and quiet.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.301
I want Mark and
Becky to move out.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.938
Well, I want them to bring
back that show Card Sharks.

07:50.971 --> 07:51.939
But it ain't going to happen.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.744
Look, Mark's got a good job.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.945
I know he's been
saving his money.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.647
I'm sure they can afford
a decent place to live.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.881
Why?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.650
You're his boss and you
never lived no place decent.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.420
It's time that they
moved out on their own.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.056
They'll never leave
unless we push them.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.257
Now, you know I'm right.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.526
Well, I just hate
to see them struggle.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.426
Fair enough.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.596
We won't visit them.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.965
[toilet flushing]

08:23.904 --> 08:26.239
[laughing]

08:30.744 --> 08:32.646
So they're gone.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.614
So?

08:33.647 --> 08:36.884
Oh, want to rub
the magic spot again?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.086
I don't feel so good.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.055
I think I got Mark's
flu or something.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.929
Great.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.263
Shaved my armpits for nothing.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.368
Unless--

08:55.402 --> 08:57.805
[farting]

08:58.505 --> 08:59.306
cool.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.847
[panting]

09:06.880 --> 09:08.315
(WHISPERED) What?
What is it?

09:08.348 --> 09:09.683
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.618
I was on the baby.

09:10.651 --> 09:14.454
No, Fred, the
baby's right here.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.823
This is crazy.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.825
With the baby in here I haven't
had one decent night's sleep

09:17.858 --> 09:18.726
since he was born.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.793
Fine.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.961
Well, we'll just put
him up for adoption

09:20.994 --> 09:23.063
then, because lord knows
you need your sleep.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.768
Hey, I got an idea.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.104
You know that room with all the
purple dinosaurs on the wall?

09:31.138 --> 09:32.572
Why don't we put
the baby in there?

09:32.606 --> 09:33.473
No.

09:33.506 --> 09:34.474
No.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.909
Fred, I read somewhere
that sleeping

09:35.943 --> 09:36.944
together bonds the family.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.078
Yeah?

09:38.111 --> 09:40.047
Well, I read somewhere
people read too much.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.014
Come here.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.182
Come to Daddy.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.717
Yeah, you remember me?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.385
Mommy let me hold you
in the delivery room.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.553
What are you
doing with the baby?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.656
Where are you taking him?

09:48.689 --> 09:51.358
Where are you taking the baby?
What are you doing with it?

09:53.493 --> 09:54.427
Where are you taking the baby?

09:57.464 --> 09:58.732
I put the baby in his crib.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.901
We can listen to him
on the baby monitor.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.035
How could you be so mean?

10:04.838 --> 10:05.639
Listened to him.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.009
Listen to him.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.680
My god.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.814
He's smothering.

10:13.847 --> 10:14.715
Jackie.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.749
Jackie!

10:15.783 --> 10:16.817
He's fine.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.686
Now, this is your
problem, it's not his.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.787
I'm putting my foot down.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.155
The baby is no longer
sleeping in our bed.

10:22.189 --> 10:22.990
Fine!

10:25.625 --> 10:29.296
Don't want the baby in here, you
don't want me in here either.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.331
Jackie!

10:31.364 --> 10:33.767
Ugh.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.269
There, there, baby, it's OK.

10:36.303 --> 10:40.841
Someday your real daddy
will come home from the sea.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.176
[music playing]

10:45.245 --> 10:46.113
Hi

10:46.146 --> 10:47.214
Hey.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.249
Fred and I had a huge
fight this morning.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.752
So I brought the baby over
here to teach Fred a lesson.

10:51.785 --> 10:52.886
Jackie, don't
you know anything?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.722
If you want to make the
man suffer, you stay.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.589
You don't leave.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.659
So can we sleep here tonight?

10:59.693 --> 11:03.463
Well, not in the house, but we
are setting up a little shanty

11:03.496 --> 11:05.766
town on the sunport.

11:05.799 --> 11:06.633
DAN: Rosie!

11:06.666 --> 11:07.567
Roseanne, please.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.836
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

11:08.869 --> 11:09.970
We'll talk about
it in a minute.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.172
But I must warn you,
Dan doesn't allow anyone

11:12.205 --> 11:13.506
to move in here unless
they're sleeping

11:13.540 --> 11:14.808
with one of his daughters.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.145
What do you want?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.446
I'm sick.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.381
When do we get to
kick out Becky and Mark?

11:21.414 --> 11:21.982
Huh?
When?

11:22.015 --> 11:22.582
When?
When?

11:22.615 --> 11:23.616
When?
When?

11:23.650 --> 11:24.651
Well, did you clean
your room and play

11:24.684 --> 11:27.120
nice with the other mechanics?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.021
All right.

11:28.055 --> 11:28.856
Go ahead.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.625
Mark!

11:32.659 --> 11:34.194
Becky!

11:34.227 --> 11:36.463
Would you please come
down here for a moment.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.364
[cawing]

11:37.397 --> 11:38.832
I feel good.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.300
[humming]

11:40.333 --> 11:41.401
I knew that I would.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.870
Hey, stop celebrating.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.204
I'm going to miss one of them.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.105
Hey.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.239
Hey.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.941
I'm sorry about making
you sick, Mrs. Conner.

11:47.975 --> 11:48.842
Oh.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.077
That's not your fault, Mark.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.378
Becky never should
have married you.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.382
So what did you want?

11:55.415 --> 11:56.649
Nothing really.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.352
We were just wondering
whatever happened to that plan

11:59.386 --> 12:03.290
you two had to find some
other place to live.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.826
It wasn't really a plan.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.560
It was more like a
long range dream.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.763
Well, congratulations,
kids, your dreams

12:09.797 --> 12:12.565
are about to come true.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.501
Well, We were kind of
hoping to wait until we

12:14.534 --> 12:15.502
could afford a two bedroom.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.569
Why?

12:16.603 --> 12:17.871
You need some place
to store your book?

12:21.574 --> 12:25.312
Mom, Dad,

12:26.313 --> 12:28.115
we're trying to have baby.

12:28.148 --> 12:32.019
- Oh, oh, do you really mean it?
- Mm-hmm.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.321
Roseanne, we need to
discuss this in private

12:34.354 --> 12:35.889
before it goes any further.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.124
Yeah, just a second.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.026
You know, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.196
This kid has got a strong jaw.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.302
Where the hell can
we talk in private?

12:49.336 --> 12:51.471
Well, Dan, there's
always the cone of silence.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.343
[laughing]

12:56.376 --> 13:00.013
Now, they can't move
out, because Beckie's

13:00.047 --> 13:02.049
going to have a baby and
she needs her mother.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.250
She's not even pregnant yet.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.784
Yeah but she will be.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.453
Mark doesn't have
anything else to do.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.056
He's already bored
with his Hot Wheels.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.591
We've talked
about this Roseanne.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.394
We don't even have a
place to fight anymore.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.529
Why is Jackie's
makeup bag in here?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.565
Uh, oh yeah.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.868
Well, I was going to tell
you about that, you know,

13:20.901 --> 13:24.104
when the time was
right, or never.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.806
Jackie's staying here too?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.608
Hey, look, we don't want
you guys fighting about

13:28.641 --> 13:29.542
was leaving.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.477
We weren't
fighting about that.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.980
We were fighting
about this towel.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.082
It's a comb cotton blend.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.183
I make a good lemon.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.318
Can't we use a wool
towel once in a while.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.286
Ooh!

13:39.319 --> 13:41.521
Hey what's going on?

13:41.554 --> 13:44.124
Darlene, we're trying to
have a private conversation.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.092
Do you mind?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.159
Fine.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.129
I just came to return
your lady shaver.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.664
Wha-- my lady shaver?

13:51.698 --> 13:52.799
That's ridiculous.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.767
What would I be doing
with a woman's razor?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.469
Well, Becky said it
was to shave your pits.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.238
How the hell did
you know about that?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.406
Know about what?

13:59.439 --> 14:00.540
That shaved his pits.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.909
Would you stop
telling people that?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.576
Yeah, cause it's not true.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.078
It's uh-- it isn't, is it Dad?

14:05.112 --> 14:06.146
[laughing]

14:06.179 --> 14:07.915
Dad, how old do I
have to be before I get

14:07.948 --> 14:10.750
to start shaving my armpits?

14:10.783 --> 14:11.919
You shave your armpits?

14:11.952 --> 14:12.819
Yes.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.753
I do.

14:13.786 --> 14:14.988
For medical reasons.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.623
Well, that's why you
shaved the right one.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.791
But tell them why
you shaved the left.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.228
That's exactly what
I was talking about.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.864
After 22 years I deserve
a little damn privacy.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.633
Excuse me, I was
just wondering how

14:26.666 --> 14:28.801
long you're all going to be.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.603
That's it!

14:30.637 --> 14:32.439
I'm going to Fred's.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.775
And you don't use a guy's lady
shaver without asking him.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.648
[music playing]

14:43.216 --> 14:45.986
You have to keep his
head at a 45 degree angle

14:46.019 --> 14:47.487
so you can keep the
blood going to the brain.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.456
Support his little bottom,
Becky, with the other hand.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.624
No with the other ha-- no, see--

14:51.658 --> 14:52.525
OK.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.094
She doesn't understand.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.930
Just bounce him up
and down a little bit.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.166
Just ni-- not real--
not real fast.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.467
He's just a little baby.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.235
Not mixing a martini.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.670
Uh, you're squishing
his leg now.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.804
OK, here we go baby.

15:04.837 --> 15:05.705
Aw.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.140
Back to mommy.
OK.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.608
Mommy's got you.
It's OK.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.443
You're all right.
How's your little leg?

15:10.477 --> 15:11.411
He's OK.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.312
All right.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.680
Isn't it fun to hold him?

15:13.713 --> 15:14.881
- Can I hold him?
- No.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.416
He doesn't want to
be held right now.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.817
But I'm not sick anymore.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.520
Well, good then why don't
you just take Becky upstairs

15:20.553 --> 15:23.623
and do what we're
paying you to do.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.358
Has Dad come back yet?

15:25.392 --> 15:26.259
Oh, no.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.460
He's sure he's right.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.695
And when it gets
like that, it takes

15:28.728 --> 15:30.697
him even longer to apologize.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.066
I know it's real
tough on everybody.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.434
We're really glad
you're letting us stay.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.004
Well, Becky, you're young
and you still need me.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.139
Your father, however,
is 44 years old,

15:39.172 --> 15:41.741
it's high time he got
out of this house.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.677
Thanks, Mom.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.646
OK, now it's time.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.647
There you are.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.049
What are you doing now?

15:49.082 --> 15:53.120
You have to keep turning him
so he has a nice shaped head.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.788
Well, if his head
gets all misshapen,

15:55.822 --> 15:56.956
you can always sand it down.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.792
Don't, don't, don't.

15:59.826 --> 16:00.693
Uh.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.794
What's your problem?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.997
Don't want your germs
getting on the baby.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.033
Jackie, kids get germs.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.734
That's what they do.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.836
They fall off their bike
and they get all bruised.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.539
And they cut their
tongue licking a cactus.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.344
Maybe that's just DJ.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.879
Excuse me for trying
to protect my child.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.914
Well, you're not
protecting your child,

16:21.948 --> 16:24.217
you're overprotecting
your child and it's

16:24.251 --> 16:25.418
screwing up your marriage.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.388
I had him in the bed.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.789
Why are you taking Fred's side.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.458
I always take the side
of the one that doesn't

16:31.491 --> 16:33.393
want to squish the baby.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.562
Baby needs me.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.664
You know, Jackie,
your kids grow up,

16:37.697 --> 16:40.400
and they just fly the
nest, and then all

16:40.433 --> 16:41.734
you got left is your husband.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.271
You must learn to let go.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.873
Well, my baby
is six months old.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.141
What's your excuse?

16:48.175 --> 16:49.042
What?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.110
Look around.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.478
Kids are all still
living here at the house

16:51.511 --> 16:54.614
with their husbands, and
their boyfriends, and me.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.982
Wonder what Dan
thinks about that?

16:56.015 --> 16:59.352
But gee, I don't
see him anywhere.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.356
Well, it's a wonder
you can see anything over

17:03.390 --> 17:05.092
your kid's big, misshapen head.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.369
You hear that, Fred?

17:16.403 --> 17:17.270
What?

17:17.304 --> 17:19.339
Nothing.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.441
Absolutely nothing.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.210
Boy that's great.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.544
Yeah.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.546
It's great how men can be
together and not have to talk.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.515
I mean, women always feel the
need to be saying something.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.449
Prattling.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.152
I can't hear the
nothing any more.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.753
Sorry.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.089
Maybe I ought to move in here.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.057
I don't know.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.393
I mean, two mature man
in one quaint house.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.595
People will talk.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.998
People hear you say
quaint and they'll talk.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.701
Dan, you've been here
for a day and a half now.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.903
Isn't it about time
you told me why.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.805
I had to get out.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.074
A man needs his space.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.110
A man without space
isn't much of a man,

17:57.144 --> 17:59.212
is he A man needs
room to stretch.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.713
Oh!

18:00.747 --> 18:01.714
[laughing]

18:01.748 --> 18:03.683
I hear you.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.684
Hi.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.986
Boy, don't you ever knock?

18:07.019 --> 18:09.522
Fred, I came
back to apologize.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.423
Really?

18:10.457 --> 18:11.724
I'm really sorry.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.025
I'm sorry too.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.162
I was being obsessed
about the baby.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.996
No, I was being insensitive.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.265
I love you, Fred.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.532
I love you too.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.433
OK, Jackie.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.202
Now go home.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.937
I was just thinking
that he doesn't have

18:24.971 --> 18:26.306
to be in the same bed
with us, but can he

18:26.339 --> 18:27.474
at least be in the same room.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.342
Of course he can be
in the room with us.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.710
He should be with
us for a while.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.611
[coughing]

18:31.644 --> 18:32.812
Wimp.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.416
Oh, and Dan, about what
happened in the bathroom,

18:36.449 --> 18:37.884
I'm really sorry
everybody found out--

18:37.917 --> 18:39.018
No, Jacki, no, no, no.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.653
You don't have to apologize.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.155
I think I do.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.456
No, Jackie, you really don't.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.593
Dan, I'm sorry that
I invaded your privacy.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.496
And that's all I'm going to say.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.766
Ah, well thank you.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.169
Thank you very much.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.870
Very sensitive of you.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.240
I'll just leave
you two guys alone.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.643
- OK.
- Jackie, you're OK.

19:03.676 --> 19:04.544
[laughing]

19:04.577 --> 19:05.445
What?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.314
He shaves his armpits.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.281
Oh!

19:08.315 --> 19:10.650
[music playing]

19:17.089 --> 19:19.492
Hi, honey.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.460
Looks like I'm too late.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.428
You've remarried.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.166
[whooping]

19:28.668 --> 19:32.272
Mm, and you made some
of that French onion dip.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.773
Still feeling sick?
- No.

19:33.806 --> 19:34.907
I feel better.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.176
But before I take you
back, we have to discuss

19:37.210 --> 19:38.478
this Becky and Mark thing.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.447
Look, I'm sorry I wanted
them out of here so bad.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.482
It's just I wanted
to be alone with you

19:42.515 --> 19:44.183
for so long I guess I
forgot we're getting

19:44.217 --> 19:46.953
buried next to each other.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.955
So you're OK with
them guys staying here?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.557
Looking forward to it.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.724
I kicked them out.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.893
Praise the lord, ain't it?

19:53.926 --> 19:57.230
It felt so good I
almost kicked DJ out too.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.765
Well, I know it must
have been hard for you.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.368
No, actually, it
wasn't hard at all, Dan.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.870
You know, I just
blamed it all on you.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.105
That's what I'm here for.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.174
But there is one thing though.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.744
Um, I gave them till May.

20:11.778 --> 20:12.579
Why till May?

20:15.348 --> 20:16.683
I'm not sick.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.517
I'm pregnant.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.725
[music playing]

20:31.298 --> 20:33.500
You're pregnant?

20:33.533 --> 20:34.301
Wow.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.871
Dan, are you coming to bed?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.848
Pregnant.

20:48.881 --> 20:49.649
Wow.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.657
Pregnant?

20:57.690 --> 20:58.491
Wow.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.834
Dan, I'm worried.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.802
Are you sure you're
OK with this?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.904
Pregnant?

21:11.938 --> 21:12.739
Wow.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.346
I mean, pregnant.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.179
Oh.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.619
OK Dan, we're heading
out for the baby's

21:26.653 --> 21:28.388
first birthday party.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.956
Are you sure you're
going to be OK with this?

21:34.661 --> 21:35.462
Pregnant.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.199
How did that happen?
