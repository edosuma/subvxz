WEBVTT

00:04.755 --> 00:06.621
I thought you didn't like
taking the Lord's name in vain?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.206
Oh, shut up.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.134
It's been a while, huh?

00:12.346 --> 00:13.132
Don't blame me.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.883
You're the one
who had a heart attack.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.304
Mm, the doctor did say
I needed to get more exercise.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.385
I think he meant
walks around the block.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.970
No, he winked at me,

00:22.189 --> 00:24.431
and did this little rotation
with his hips, like...

00:27.736 --> 00:28.476
Mm.

00:28.695 --> 00:29.526
Hmm.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.854
Hey, we got any plans
this weekend?

00:32.950 --> 00:35.818
I thought maybe we could get
started on the vegetable garden,

00:36.036 --> 00:37.868
and then, of course,
church on Sunday.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.662
Yeah, that does sound fun,

00:39.873 --> 00:42.035
but what if, instead,
I was to go up to Bethy Creek

00:42.251 --> 00:43.833
with Georgie
and do some fishing?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.286
How long you been waiting
to spring that on me?

00:46.505 --> 00:48.542
Well, not till I was done
rotating my hips.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.214
You're awful.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.050
So what do you say?

00:56.306 --> 00:57.296
What about Sheldon?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.219
What about him?

00:59.434 --> 01:00.299
George.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.055
You can't always leave him out.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.637
I'm not leaving him out.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.312
You know how
he is about fishing.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.269
Get it away, get it away!

01:07.484 --> 01:08.816
Calm down,
it's an itty-bitty thing.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.019
No, <i>I'm</i> an itty-bitty thing!

01:11.530 --> 01:13.362
Who says you have to
take him fishing?

01:13.574 --> 01:14.781
Find something else
to do with him.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.028
Something he'd like.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.359
What are we gonna do?
Spend the weekend

01:17.578 --> 01:18.864
sitting around, thinking?

01:19.162 --> 01:19.948
George.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.574
You have to make an effort.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.372
Young boys who don't spend
time with their daddies

01:23.584 --> 01:25.325
grow up to be oddballs.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.628
Honey, I hate to tell you, but
that ball is already pretty odd.

01:30.882 --> 01:31.872
Please.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.259
Okay, fine.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.722
I'll talk to him.
We'll think of something.

01:40.017 --> 01:40.677
Good.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.599
Thank you.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.728
What?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.770
I was just remembering
when I took him camping.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.101
<i>Moth! Moth!</i>

01:51.320 --> 01:52.731
<i>Sheldon, it's just a butterfly.</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:54.062
<i>How is that any better?</i>

01:54.281 --> 01:56.068
Butterfly, butterfly!

02:21.725 --> 02:22.841
Hey, pal.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.180
Playing with your rockets?

02:25.437 --> 02:28.145
I'm trying to calculate
ballistic coefficients.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.765
Well, that's fun, too.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.604
Listen, I don't have
to work this weekend;

02:32.819 --> 02:34.776
I was wondering if you wanted
to do something together.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.020
Like what?

02:36.740 --> 02:37.947
Whatever you want.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.650
Well, the filter on my air
purifier needs to be changed.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.110
How about a trip to Sears?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.450
Yeah, I was thinking
along the lines of something

02:44.665 --> 02:45.621
a little more active.

02:46.124 --> 02:46.955
<i>Like last year,</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:48.032
we went fishing...

02:48.251 --> 02:49.116
Mom! Dad's trying

02:49.336 --> 02:50.452
to make me go fishing!

02:50.671 --> 02:52.287
No, no, it's okay.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.417
We're not going fishing.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.920
All right, good.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.000
<i>But seriously,</i>

02:58.470 --> 02:59.301
was fishing really that bad?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.254
Mom! Dad's trying to convince me

03:01.473 --> 03:02.964
that fishing wasn't that bad!

03:03.183 --> 03:04.299
Shh. Come on!

03:04.518 --> 03:05.759
Forget I said anything
about fishing.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.101
Just think about it,

03:08.313 --> 03:09.679
and we'll do whatever you want.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.435
Thank you.

03:14.236 --> 03:17.070
There is the launching of
the space shuttle this weekend.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.571
Space shuttle?

03:19.074 --> 03:20.315
Don't they do those
out of Florida?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.275
Yes. Cape Canaveral.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.988
Sheldon, that's-that's like
a 12, 15 hour drive.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.325
I understand. Never mind.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.461
You know what? Let's do it.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.128
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

03:35.340 --> 03:37.457
The three Cooper boys
on a little adventure.

03:37.884 --> 03:38.624
Sound good?

03:39.803 --> 03:40.884
Sounds good.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.802
<i>My plan was coming together.</i>

03:46.017 --> 03:47.849
<i>I just needed to get
on the shuttle</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:51.520
<i>so I could finally escape
this ridiculous planet.</i>

03:52.149 --> 03:55.062
<i>Spoiler alert, I'm still here.</i>

03:55.444 --> 03:56.525
So, Sheldon, me, and Georgie

03:56.737 --> 03:58.399
are gonna take
a little road trip this weekend,

03:58.613 --> 03:59.694
see the shuttle launch.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.522
Looks like I don't
get a vote in this.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.233
Oh, good, you're catching on.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.660
I wonder if we'll get
to meet an astronaut.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.237
I remember
when I was a teenager,

04:07.456 --> 04:10.290
I had the biggest crush
on John Glenn.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.492
I would've given it up
for him no problem.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.501
- Mom.
- Given what up?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.120
Her allowance.
Just eat.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.829
<i>So how long
are you gonna be gone?</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:19.423
Oh, we'll leave first thing
Saturday morning,

04:19.676 --> 04:20.507
stay the night in a motel,

04:20.719 --> 04:22.961
and see the launch
bright and early on Sunday.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.387
I can't believe
we're going to see

04:24.598 --> 04:26.590
an actual working spacecraft.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.349
Look how happy he is.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.391
Good job.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.764
How come I don't get to go?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.140
'Cause you, me, and Meemaw

04:32.355 --> 04:33.641
are gonna have our own fun.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.686
Could we shoot guns
at the gun range?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.893
Mm, you're too young
to go to the gun range.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.318
Meemaw took me.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.236
We pinky swore.
What are you doing?

04:41.740 --> 04:42.446
Oh, yeah.

04:42.824 --> 04:43.564
Don't listen to me.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.616
I don't know what I'm saying.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.156
I know you like
to just keep driving,

04:52.417 --> 04:54.079
and get where you're going,
but you can't ignore

04:54.294 --> 04:56.160
- his bathroom schedule.
- I know.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.291
He goes number one
first thing in the morning,

04:58.507 --> 05:01.716
then again in the afternoon,
once more in the late afternoon,

05:01.927 --> 05:04.340
say 4:00, 4:30,
depending on his juice intake,

05:04.554 --> 05:06.295
and then, a quick piddle
before bedtime.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.723
- "Piddle." Got it.
<i>- Now,</i>

05:08.934 --> 05:09.924
number two's a little trickier.

05:10.143 --> 05:10.974
<i>Mary? Relax.</i>

05:11.186 --> 05:12.302
I can take care of my son.

05:13.313 --> 05:13.928
I know.

05:14.147 --> 05:14.807
Good.

05:15.023 --> 05:15.809
I'm just saying,

05:16.024 --> 05:17.390
if he's upset
or nervous,

05:17.609 --> 05:18.725
he can get all clogged up.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.185
I won't let that happen.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.560
Thank you.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.316
Okay, let's talk about food.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.147
<i>No need to.</i>

05:25.450 --> 05:28.238
He likes his meat cooked
to at least 165 degrees,

05:28.453 --> 05:30.069
except for chicken,
which is 180.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.405
The different foods can't touch
each other on the plate.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.616
Ketchup and mustard
must come out of a packet.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.491
No bottles.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.829
What about his issues
with spaghetti?

05:41.216 --> 05:41.956
That's a trick question.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.131
He likes spaghetti.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.085
All right, I guess you got this.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.473
Georgie.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.809
Up and at 'em.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.567
<i>Missy, where's
your brother?</i>

06:05.824 --> 06:07.486
Who cares?

06:15.917 --> 06:16.907
Sheldon, you in there?

06:17.127 --> 06:17.742
<i>Dad!</i>

06:17.961 --> 06:18.951
Sorry, Georgie.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.458
What's going on?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.377
I can't find Sheldon.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.378
What do you mean,
you can't find him?

06:25.594 --> 06:27.335
I mean I don't know where he is.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.636
Well, he's got to be somewhere.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.055
Maybe he got that time machine
to work.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.471
Where the hell...

06:35.687 --> 06:37.053
George.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.605
<i>I think he's ready to go.</i>

06:46.031 --> 06:46.646
<i>Wait, Georgie.</i>

06:46.865 --> 06:48.652
- Where's your bag?
- Don't need one.

06:48.867 --> 06:49.948
Got my toothbrush right here.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.276
What about clothes?

06:51.620 --> 06:52.701
A change of underwear?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.195
Got it.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.497
Georgie, you're gonna
be gone for two days.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.907
I'll turn them inside out.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.497
- Shotgun!
- No, no.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.328
Let your brother sit
up front for a change.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.004
I actually prefer
sitting in the back.

07:04.215 --> 07:04.921
It's safer.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.375
Oh, come on, sit up front
with your daddy.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.256
<i>He doesn't get to spend
enough time with you.</i>

07:09.471 --> 07:10.837
I called shotgun.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.095
George.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.549
We'll flip a coin.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.555
All right?
Georgie, call it.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.886
Heads.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.308
Tails.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.559
- Dang it.
<i>- Sheldon, you won.</i>

07:21.858 --> 07:23.019
You get to ride up front.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.475
Can't we do two out of three?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.731
You won. Get in the car.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.813
What's the point
in calling shotgun?

07:29.574 --> 07:30.610
You're a good dad.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.942
If I don't kill one of them
before Sunday, I'm a good dad.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.452
Have fun.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.406
Love you guys.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.457
<i>Bye! Drive safe!</i>

07:47.509 --> 07:51.253
Oh, this was a good idea,
this was a good idea,

07:51.471 --> 07:52.962
this was a good idea.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.846
This was a good idea.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.391
Isn't this exciting?

08:01.606 --> 08:04.599
It's just us girls,
no boys in the house.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.059
The place already smells better.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.231
So what are we gonna do?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.436
<i>How would you like</i>

08:09.823 --> 08:10.859
to go to the beauty salon

08:11.074 --> 08:12.531
and get all done up?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.491
Can I have orange hair
like Cyndi Lauper?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.614
I don't think so.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.822
Meemaw has friends
with blue hair.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.030
She's right.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.078
I haven't gone there yet,

08:22.293 --> 08:24.751
but after a certain age,
it's mandatory.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.500
Your hair's not changing color.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.298
- Aw.
<i>- Sorry, kiddo.</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:31.921
Your mom is no fun.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.839
Excuse me, I'm fun.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.044
So I can color my hair?

08:35.265 --> 08:36.301
Not a chance.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.847
But I'm very much fun.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.597
Whatever you need to believe.

08:40.812 --> 08:41.893
Mein Führer.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.482
Dad?

08:54.701 --> 08:55.532
Yeah?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.993
Would you like
to have a conversation?

08:58.496 --> 09:00.328
Yeah. Sure.
Absolutely.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.827
All right, what would you
like to talk about?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.161
Um, well, let's see.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.996
Uh... have you given much
thought to what you want to be

09:09.215 --> 09:10.001
when you grow up?

09:11.092 --> 09:12.173
I have.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.463
Great.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.714
And what would that be?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.888
Oh. Most likely a scientist.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.517
Unless I stay in Texas,
then I'm thinking cattle baron.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.813
Cattle baron?

09:27.025 --> 09:29.108
Assuming I don't have
to touch the cows.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.144
Goes without saying.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.897
Did you always want
to be a football coach?

09:34.365 --> 09:35.651
Well, I always
wanted to play.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.108
At least till
I got hurt.

09:37.786 --> 09:38.446
Mm.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.403
Were you a good player?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.739
Eh, not really.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.619
I was just bigger
than the other kids.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.955
So you compensated
for mediocrity

09:47.170 --> 09:48.581
by being large.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.246
I guess.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.340
That works for cattle as well.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.133
Oh, well, thanks for
pointing that out.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.217
You're welcome.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.422
You might want to
open a window.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.008
Oh, boy.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.220
Oh...

10:11.319 --> 10:13.231
My head is so hot.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.063
She is such a hoot.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.487
- You okay?
- Fine.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.862
Okay, don't tell me.

10:23.665 --> 10:24.746
<i>So hot...</i>

10:26.042 --> 10:27.283
I don't like you
making me out

10:27.502 --> 10:28.788
to be the bad guy
just 'cause I won't

10:29.003 --> 10:30.710
let my daughter do
whatever she wants.

10:30.922 --> 10:31.753
I gave you a lot
of freedom,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.251
you turned out okay.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.752
You didn't
give me freedom.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.254
You were never around.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.919
Is that so?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.630
I guarantee I made supper
for Charlene and Edward

10:40.849 --> 10:41.965
more times than you ever did.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.469
I basically raised 'em.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.017
You think I was
out dancing?

10:45.228 --> 10:46.935
I was out working two jobs
so your daddy could

10:47.147 --> 10:49.355
lose all our money on that
damn chain of Fotomats!

10:49.566 --> 10:51.432
It wasn't Daddy's fault that
those little things blew over

10:51.651 --> 10:53.233
every time
there was a storm.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.400
Hmm.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.313
Seriously,
I'm melting.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.028
<i>Dead armadillo.</i>

11:01.244 --> 11:02.451
That's three for me.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.454
This is a terrible
driving game.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.368
Is it roadkill if
it's still twitchin'?

11:08.585 --> 11:11.453
Huh, both alive and dead,
just like Schrödinger's cat.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.291
I didn't know he had a cat.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.921
You've heard of Schrödinger?

11:15.258 --> 11:16.794
Sure. It's the kid
from Charlie Brown

11:17.010 --> 11:18.171
who plays the piano.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.922
Lucy's got
a crush on him.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.597
Schrödinger's cat
is a thought experiment.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.092
<i>A cat in a box is
exposed to poison,</i>

11:26.311 --> 11:28.974
and is both alive and dead
until it is observed.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.930
So the cat's name
is Schrödinger?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.097
No.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.524
Well, what's its name?

11:33.735 --> 11:35.226
Its name doesn't matter.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.902
It does if the cat was dead.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.105
Otherwise, what are you gonna
put on his tombstone?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.231
Not likely the cat's
getting a tombstone.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.987
It would in a pet cemetery.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.616
Fine, the cat's name
is Mittens.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.447
Because he has
little white feet?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.073
Sure.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.659
So, in this thought
experiment,

11:52.545 --> 11:54.411
do you think Mittens
is dead or alive?

11:54.631 --> 11:57.294
There's no way of saying
until you open the box.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.466
Oh, come on.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.753
Optimistically, I would choose
to believe he's alive.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.721
- Yes!
- Oh, thank goodness.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.431
<i>Oh, dead crow.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:08.467
<i>There ain't no doubt
about that one.</i>

12:15.151 --> 12:17.063
The toilet was sanitized
for my protection.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.814
I love this place.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.318
Dad, can we go
to Reptile World?

12:21.532 --> 12:22.818
- No.
<i>- They got a snake</i>

12:23.034 --> 12:24.900
so big it can eat
a whole chicken.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.156
Oh, well, in that case, no.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.079
- Aw.
<i>- Let's get some sleep.</i>

12:29.374 --> 12:31.081
We got to get up early if we're
gonna get to Cape Canaveral

12:31.292 --> 12:32.373
in time for liftoff.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.292
I'm so excited,
I don't know if I can.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.496
Well, buddy, you're
gonna have to try, all right?

12:36.714 --> 12:39.001
You two share that bed,
I'll take this one.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.583
- No.
- Nuh-uh.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.093
Come on, fellas,
I'm the biggest.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.011
It makes sense that
I get a bed to myself.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.760
- No.
- Nuh-uh.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.307
We'll flip for it.
Georgie, call it.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.855
Heads.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.475
Not your day.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.767
Dang it.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.354
- That looked like heads.
- Go brush your teeth.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.612
This really works?

13:06.828 --> 13:11.573
Your hair will look
just as pretty tomorrow.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.369
Now, come on,
let's tuck you in.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.953
I'm glad I don't have
orange hair.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.412
Me, too, baby.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.293
I want to be
more like Madonna.

13:20.883 --> 13:21.964
Are you trying to kill me?

13:22.176 --> 13:23.292
'Cause if you are, good job.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.220
Why is she only like a virgin?

13:30.435 --> 13:31.596
<i>Good night!</i>

13:34.981 --> 13:36.847
You ready to finish
our conversation?

13:37.066 --> 13:38.056
There's nothing
to finish.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.142
I raised myself
like a jungle child.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.226
End of story.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.608
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.813
You think I didn't feel bad

13:45.033 --> 13:47.400
not being around more
than I wanted to be?

13:47.994 --> 13:48.780
Did you?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.115
A little bit.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.997
I'm teasing, come on.
Of course I did.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.699
Why else would I have
begged you and George

13:55.918 --> 13:57.034
to move back to Medford?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.744
So you could be with
your grandchildren.

13:58.963 --> 13:59.794
And you.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.581
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

14:01.799 --> 14:03.756
You're the only one of my
children still talking to me.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.084
No surprise there.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.376
Besides, you raised yourself

14:06.596 --> 14:08.132
better than I ever could.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.256
You actually believe that?

14:10.725 --> 14:13.968
No, but it would help
my cause if you did.

14:22.904 --> 14:23.860
Your hair looks pretty.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.404
Enough.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.077
Dad?

14:38.086 --> 14:39.042
<i>Dad?</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:41.669
Dad?

14:42.340 --> 14:43.876
Dad.

14:44.342 --> 14:44.957
What?

14:45.176 --> 14:46.633
Georgie keeps kicking me.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.176
Kick him back.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.463
I'd rather not touch him.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.640
You want to sleep with me?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.309
Yes, thank you.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.098
Yeah.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.818
Got enough room?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.066
Yes.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.698
You throw off
a lot of heat.

15:14.997 --> 15:15.987
Sorry.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.791
That's all right.
It's kind of nice.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.756
Do they launch those shuttles
in the rain?

15:34.559 --> 15:36.516
I think a light rain's okay.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.642
Oh, no.

15:41.858 --> 15:42.644
It'll pass.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.392
Just get some sleep.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.109
It didn't pass.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.153
Sheldon, I'm real sorry.

16:04.839 --> 16:05.955
Can I tell you a secret?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.424
I never understood
how lightning works.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.927
Didn't they teach you
that in high school?

16:12.138 --> 16:12.924
They probably did,

16:13.139 --> 16:16.257
but I got hit in the head
a lot playing football.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.096
Would you explain it
to me?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.014
Well, when positive and negative
charges grow large enough,

16:23.232 --> 16:25.315
a giant spark occurs
in the cloud.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.985
Ah, that-that's pretty cool.
What causes the thunder?

16:29.197 --> 16:32.986
It's a shock wave from particles
heated to 10,000 degrees.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.657
Interesting.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.111
- You want to know what's really interesting?
- Hmm?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.071
Aristotle thought that
the sound of thunder

16:39.290 --> 16:41.373
was due to a collision
between two clouds.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.416
He believed the clouds were
expelling air,

16:43.628 --> 16:45.369
in the way a log on
a fire crackles...

16:45.588 --> 16:48.251
<i>I didn't realize
until years later</i>

16:48.466 --> 16:50.799
<i>that my father was
only asking questions</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:53.878
<i>about lightning and thunder
to cheer me up.</i>

16:54.096 --> 16:56.509
<i>In fact, he would often
pretend to be dumb</i>

16:56.724 --> 16:58.090
<i>just to make me feel better.</i>

16:58.601 --> 17:00.058
Looks like rain.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.760
<i>My brother, on the other hand,</i>

17:01.979 --> 17:03.220
<i>didn't have to pretend.</i>

17:11.571 --> 17:13.905
Okay, on the count of three,
we run to the car.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.449
- Ready? One, two...
- Wait.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.071
I want shotgun going back.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.954
Fine, you get shotgun.
Okay, here we go.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.997
- One, two...
- I still think

17:23.209 --> 17:25.040
we should wait
till the rain slows down.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.585
<i>No, we got to get home.</i>

17:26.796 --> 17:28.502
I got work tomorrow,
you guys got school.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.125
You do realize I'll get wet?

17:30.341 --> 17:31.877
It's just water, Sheldon.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.376
All right.
Just making sure you realize.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.549
All right, here we go. Ready?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.926
One, two, three.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.192
Buddy, I thought
we had a plan.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.823
<i>You</i> had a plan.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.260
<i>I never did get
to see a launch in person,</i>

18:20.474 --> 18:23.308
<i>but that was the best trip
I ever had.</i>

18:28.316 --> 18:31.855
<i>I wish I had told my father
while he was alive.</i>
