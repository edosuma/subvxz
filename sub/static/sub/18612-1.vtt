00:16.564 --> 00:19.070
Let me out!!!

00:26.150 --> 00:28.758
Why are you doing this to me?

00:40.143 --> 00:43.149
Please.No...

01:07.964 --> 01:10.877
I'm not a little piggy.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.680
I'm not a little piggy.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.996
I'm not a little piggy.

02:16.899 --> 02:19.440
Help.

02:23.345 --> 02:26.281
Let me go.

02:26.282 --> 02:28.788
Help!

02:32.531 --> 02:34.941
Help!

02:35.503 --> 02:38.951
Help.

02:40.177 --> 02:42.580
Let me out, please.

02:42.581 --> 02:45.394
Help!

04:00.500 --> 04:03.639
Woman: Ashville County Police
Department. What is your emergency?

04:03.640 --> 04:06.277
- I was in a box.
- Tell me where you are, ma'am.

04:06.278 --> 04:09.752
- I... I... I don't know.
- Just give me your location.

04:09.753 --> 04:11.956
I don't know.

04:11.957 --> 04:15.631
I don't. I don't.

04:15.632 --> 04:17.937
Ma'am, are you still with me?

04:17.938 --> 04:19.874
I don't know.

04:19.875 --> 04:23.018
What do you see around you?
Can you give me any kind of landmark?

04:25.586 --> 04:27.619
Dead people.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.257
Dead boxes.

04:29.258 --> 04:31.662
I woke up in a box.

04:31.663 --> 04:35.512
Can you tell me where we can find you?
We'll send an officer out.

04:36.006 --> 04:38.542
Ma'am, you must communicate.
Ma'am?

04:40.881 --> 04:45.299
Try to stay on the line for 30 seconds.
We'll run a trace.

04:56.345 --> 04:59.419
20 more seconds.

05:39.961 --> 05:42.467
Hello?

05:50.415 --> 05:52.922
Are you from the police?

06:12.996 --> 06:16.877
Bring her out.
I'll take care of the little piggy.

06:35.272 --> 06:37.813
Man: Is somebody in there?

06:47.427 --> 06:50.635
Oh shoot, a locked door.

06:50.636 --> 06:53.073
How'd you get in there?
Are you okay?

06:53.074 --> 06:56.024
Don't you worry. I've got some keys.
I'll get you out.

06:56.914 --> 06:58.551
- What?
- He's there.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.586
No, ain't nobody here but me.
I'll get you out.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.290
Don't worry.
Ain't nobody here.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.240
He's there.

08:15.124 --> 08:18.039
Man: Did you run out of gas?

08:19.200 --> 08:23.082
I'd siphon you some of mine, but I'm pretty
much floating on empty myself.

08:30.021 --> 08:31.855
So you got a name?

08:31.856 --> 08:34.561
Probably.

08:34.562 --> 08:37.032
My name's Tucker.

08:37.033 --> 08:40.073
I work back at Schaffer's Mine,
back in the holler.

08:40.977 --> 08:44.516
You ain't from around these parts,
are you?

08:45.516 --> 08:49.026
I don't know.

08:51.662 --> 08:54.203
Well, where you come from?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.938
I mean, just now.
Where did you come from?

08:56.939 --> 08:59.879
Where the dead people are.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.280
Ooh.

09:01.281 --> 09:04.459
That is quite a party, eh?

09:05.557 --> 09:09.268
Dead people.
Oh, the cemetery.

09:12.872 --> 09:15.811
Well, can you remember
where your car is

09:15.812 --> 09:19.716
or someplace
I can drop you off at then?

09:19.717 --> 09:22.589
Where the police lady is.

09:22.590 --> 09:26.498
If you called 911,
that goes into the city.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.766
The police lady will help.

09:28.767 --> 09:33.654
Sorry, sweetie, but that's
a little over 100 miles from here.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.921
Why don't you just tell me what happened?
Maybe we can get you a little help.

09:38.922 --> 09:43.363
I woke up
in a dead box.

09:43.364 --> 09:46.035
And a man tried to get me.

09:46.036 --> 09:49.941
All right, all right.
Cindy's gonna know what to do.

09:49.942 --> 09:53.217
Are you out of your mind?
We don't even know her.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.788
She's probably one of them
crystal meth tweakers.

09:55.789 --> 09:58.895
- Lower your voice.
- I will not lower my voice.

09:58.896 --> 10:00.595
Have you seen
the way she's dressed?

10:00.596 --> 10:03.100
It wouldn't surprise me
if she was a prostitute.

10:03.101 --> 10:05.507
Come on. She's pretty and all,
but I don't think...

10:05.508 --> 10:08.649
Oh. Oh, she's pretty, is she?

10:10.384 --> 10:12.052
I get it.

10:12.087 --> 10:14.224
Cindy, don't go being judgmental.

10:14.225 --> 10:16.961
Let's just go out and talk to her.

10:16.962 --> 10:21.270
I need you to see if you can make
some sense out of her, okay?

10:21.271 --> 10:24.549
Her old man probably
roughed her up is all.

10:41.981 --> 10:44.484
Thank you.

10:46.622 --> 10:49.291
Hey now. You must be...

10:49.292 --> 10:53.142
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

10:54.435 --> 10:56.739
Tucker tells me
he picked you up on the street,

10:56.740 --> 11:00.178
that you were coming from a...

11:00.179 --> 11:03.887
a cemetery? Is that right?

11:03.888 --> 11:05.489
Wa... water.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.942
Oh, I'll get you some.

11:09.433 --> 11:12.971
Listen, ma'am, I...

11:12.972 --> 11:14.876
I heard what you said back there.

11:14.877 --> 11:17.349
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
I just...

11:17.350 --> 11:19.952
All I know is

11:19.953 --> 11:22.526
my head hurts

11:22.527 --> 11:25.129
real bad.

11:25.130 --> 11:28.103
And I don't know where this is

11:28.104 --> 11:31.074
or how I got here.

11:31.075 --> 11:35.350
I can't think
of all the names, first off,

11:35.351 --> 11:38.254
probably 'cause my head
hurts so bad.

11:38.255 --> 11:41.261
I also know that I saw a man...

11:41.262 --> 11:44.035
an old man get dead.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.674
And another man tried to hurt me.

11:47.675 --> 11:52.286
I woke up in a box also.
I don't know if he told you that.

11:53.651 --> 11:57.260
So for all I know, I'm already dead.

11:57.261 --> 12:00.607
Oh, who's dead?

12:09.183 --> 12:11.286
I want to go to the police lady's
house now.

12:11.287 --> 12:15.929
Oh, hon, all we got is that truck
and this genius here ran it out of gas.

12:15.930 --> 12:19.235
We can use the telephone
and get more gas.

12:19.236 --> 12:22.008
And then the police lady
can come get me.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.146
Oh, sweetie, our phone got
cut off two months ago.

12:24.147 --> 12:25.880
We didn't use it no how.

12:25.881 --> 12:27.885
My brother will be here in the morning
with his truck.

12:27.886 --> 12:30.223
No. No.

12:30.224 --> 12:32.995
Somebody needs to know
about the old man.

12:32.996 --> 12:35.667
Tucker: Well, you don't even know
where he was.

12:35.668 --> 12:38.872
There's lots of cemeteries
around here

12:38.873 --> 12:41.010
and my truck ain't got
but a couple of miles on him.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.983
Look, I'll tell you what...
you take a shower.

12:43.984 --> 12:46.756
We'll find you some clean clothes.
You can take a shirt of Tucker's

12:46.757 --> 12:50.263
and I got some nice shoes.
They'll make you feel better, I promise.

12:50.264 --> 12:52.434
And in the morning we'll take you
to the sheriffs.

12:52.435 --> 12:54.904
You're safe here.
I'll even cook you breakfast.

12:54.905 --> 12:57.355
You're safe here.

13:41.931 --> 13:44.676
Still love me?

13:52.250 --> 13:55.599
I love you more than anything.

13:58.631 --> 14:01.635
I feel real mean about what I said
about her.

14:01.636 --> 14:04.475
She's sweet.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.280
I just hope to God
she leaves that guy.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.885
Don't feel bad.

14:09.886 --> 14:12.323
I think we're doing the right thing.

14:12.324 --> 14:14.729
We're doing the Christian thing.

14:14.730 --> 14:18.168
Just you keep it Christian.

14:18.169 --> 14:21.117
Don't you go sneaking in there
when I'm asleep.

14:21.742 --> 14:24.246
Yeah.

14:27.656 --> 14:30.400
She definitely ain't dead.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.425
Hey, baby girl.

14:48.964 --> 14:51.331
I'm sorry.

14:51.332 --> 14:53.714
Sorry.

14:54.209 --> 14:57.314
Everything's gonna be fine,
I promise you.

14:57.315 --> 14:59.854
It's all gonna be okay.

15:25.922 --> 15:27.926
Tucker: Hey.

15:31.868 --> 15:35.442
Heard your foot tapping there, thought
you was dancing in here or something.

15:37.945 --> 15:40.258
Let me take a look
at that back there.

15:48.066 --> 15:51.448
Ow. I'm sorry.

15:52.605 --> 15:55.452
That's all right. No, I'm sorry.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.593
Be honest with us.

16:01.491 --> 16:04.305
Did your old man do this to you?

16:07.337 --> 16:11.642
Why did that man try to hurt me?

16:11.643 --> 16:15.357
Some people's just rotten.

16:16.754 --> 16:18.790
They're just ruined right from the start.

16:18.791 --> 16:21.763
We're gonna go to that station tomorrow.

16:21.764 --> 16:23.800
I promise you, they gotta have
some sort of list

16:23.801 --> 16:26.171
that shows people gone missing.

16:26.172 --> 16:28.610
Hey, I got an idea.

16:28.611 --> 16:31.350
Since you can't
remember your name,

16:31.351 --> 16:33.384
why don't we
pick one out for you...

16:33.385 --> 16:36.560
- just till you get yours back anyway?
- Okay.

16:36.561 --> 16:41.603
Try real hard. Maybe you can recall
something from when you was little.

16:51.854 --> 16:54.159
Princess Gemstone.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.935
I think I used to be friends
with Princess Gemstone.

16:58.936 --> 17:01.908
All right, Princess.

17:01.909 --> 17:06.917
Cindy should be whipping up breakfast
probably about 5:30.

17:06.919 --> 17:08.924
You like bacon?

17:10.025 --> 17:13.233
You're gonna like Cindy's bacon.

17:13.731 --> 17:16.167
Get yourself some rest, okay?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.708
See you in the morning.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.596
Hey, Cindy.

17:28.262 --> 17:30.572
Cindy?

17:31.066 --> 17:33.607
Cindy, come on.
I locked myself out.

17:40.821 --> 17:42.354
Cindy?

17:42.355 --> 17:44.625
Honey.

17:44.626 --> 17:47.803
Oh, God Jesus.

17:49.704 --> 17:52.948
No! Cindy!

17:55.147 --> 17:56.984
It really hurts.

17:56.985 --> 17:59.486
What do you want?

18:03.563 --> 18:04.663
Tucker.

18:04.664 --> 18:05.934
No.

18:05.935 --> 18:08.173
No! No no.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.945
He's gonna kill her.
He's gonna cut her.

18:10.946 --> 18:13.883
What? God!

18:13.884 --> 18:15.920
Take me. Kill me.

18:15.921 --> 18:17.900
Kill me, you fuck.

18:22.066 --> 18:27.143
No, please.
He's gonna kill us all.

18:27.144 --> 18:30.251
No, don't look. No.

18:31.953 --> 18:34.388
Please go. Go!

18:34.389 --> 18:36.427
Don't look. Don't look.

18:36.428 --> 18:38.603
Go go.

18:40.803 --> 18:43.616
No! No!

19:05.950 --> 19:08.990
Why are we out here, Johnny?

19:08.991 --> 19:11.863
We could have stayed home
for some lovin'.

19:11.864 --> 19:14.504
- His truck's gone.
- So?

19:16.905 --> 19:20.480
Baby, I'm all emotional
and shit here.

19:20.481 --> 19:23.653
What did you drag me out of bed
in the middle of the night for?

19:23.654 --> 19:26.259
Look, I saw Tucker with some
black-headed girl

19:26.260 --> 19:28.296
heading down Route 28.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.398
You think he's cheating on Cindy?

19:30.399 --> 19:32.769
I never figured Tucker for the type,

19:32.770 --> 19:35.509
that lying sack of shit,

19:35.510 --> 19:37.413
but I saw what I saw.

19:37.414 --> 19:41.219
Now I gotta go in there,
I gotta wake my sister up and tell her.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.599
Whose car is that?

19:44.663 --> 19:48.468
Crum... crumskull?

19:48.469 --> 19:51.307
Cromskill?

19:51.308 --> 19:53.347
Maybe it's his whore's.

20:02.129 --> 20:05.800
Baby, why don't you wait till the morning
when y'all ride to work together?

20:05.801 --> 20:09.810
Hold on, Jamie. I'm dying to know
who this bitch is.

20:12.583 --> 20:15.191
Shit.

20:23.505 --> 20:27.250
Hell, maybe I should see
who you've been texting, mister.

20:34.091 --> 20:36.665
Baby, you'd never cheat on me now,
would you?

20:39.034 --> 20:42.440
Baby, I would never
cheat on you.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.251
And I never have...

22:18.790 --> 22:21.662
I know this is the worst thing,

22:21.663 --> 22:25.202
but we have to find a telephone

22:25.203 --> 22:27.742
and call the police.

22:28.343 --> 22:31.383
Oh, God.

22:36.927 --> 22:40.740
Wherever we stop's
where we're gonna be.

22:41.501 --> 22:43.948
All right?
If there ain't nobody home,

22:44.305 --> 22:47.179
they ain't got a phone,
we're fucked.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.214
Please.

22:49.215 --> 22:52.426
Please, next house.

22:57.431 --> 23:02.249
Next house.

23:09.190 --> 23:10.823
It's kind of late, isn't it?

23:10.824 --> 23:13.094
We need a telephone.

23:13.095 --> 23:14.999
Really fast.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.483
I don't have a traditional landline
per se.

23:21.346 --> 23:23.327
But I have a computer.

23:27.223 --> 23:29.326
Lock it.

23:29.327 --> 23:31.811
What?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.337
Can that get us the sheriff?

23:34.338 --> 23:37.009
Yeah, I can send an email.

23:37.010 --> 23:40.848
Yeah, mail and tell them
to send all the cops.

23:40.849 --> 23:43.595
The police, huh? What for?

23:47.931 --> 23:50.106
His wife just died.

23:51.637 --> 23:53.675
I'm so sorry.

23:53.676 --> 23:56.345
I know how you feel.
My mother just passed.

23:56.346 --> 24:01.622
Did she get stuck
with a big knife?

24:01.623 --> 24:04.196
Did she get a knife st...? No.
No, she didn't...

24:04.197 --> 24:06.700
Is that a question...?

24:06.701 --> 24:11.211
A man with a shiny face...
he killed her

24:11.212 --> 24:14.348
and an old man.

24:14.349 --> 24:15.683
And he wants to...

24:15.684 --> 24:18.054
- He had a shiny face and he...
- He wants to make me dead.

24:18.055 --> 24:20.826
Fantastic. Great. Okay.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.500
Will it take long?

24:23.501 --> 24:26.347
In this golden age of technology,
who needs a telephone?

24:36.160 --> 24:38.801
Actually, it might just take a minute.

24:58.435 --> 25:00.472
"Do you have evidence
of insurance fraud

25:00.473 --> 25:03.278
or fraud committed
by an insurance broker or carrier?

25:03.279 --> 25:07.354
Do you suspect or know
of illegal terrorist or criminal activity?"

25:07.355 --> 25:08.589
No, make it go down.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.626
Okay, scrolling scrolling scroll...

25:10.627 --> 25:12.564
"Are you an eyewitness to any crime?

25:12.565 --> 25:14.699
Are you willing to...?"

25:14.700 --> 25:16.604
Yeah yeah, go on,
send over one of them mails.

25:16.605 --> 25:17.975
Come on.

25:17.976 --> 25:20.009
Okay.

25:20.010 --> 25:23.724
"Help. Send many cops. "

25:31.334 --> 25:33.875
Okay, it's sent.

25:36.947 --> 25:39.114
What are you doing there?

25:39.115 --> 25:41.752
I'm trying to find out
some more information

25:41.753 --> 25:43.859
about the guy.

25:44.358 --> 25:47.536
You can find out about people
on this thing?

25:48.501 --> 25:51.372
Let's see...
nothing on the "America's Most Wanted. "

25:51.373 --> 25:54.287
Here's a link to the FBl site.

25:54.947 --> 25:56.983
Oh my God.

25:56.984 --> 25:59.454
What? What does it say?

25:59.455 --> 26:01.826
I don't know.
I wonder if this is him.

26:01.827 --> 26:05.298
The FBl believe over 30 women
from Florida, Georgia and Alabama

26:05.299 --> 26:08.204
have all been taken
by this lunatic guy.

26:08.205 --> 26:11.044
Yadda yadda yadda, "authorities believe
that the killer is Caucasian,

26:11.045 --> 26:13.982
late '30s to early '40s,
probably an affluent citizen

26:13.983 --> 26:16.721
like a doctor or a surgeon. "

26:16.722 --> 26:20.130
Well, if they ain't found them,
how do they know they're dead?

26:20.131 --> 26:22.738
Did he happen to have
a video camera?

26:23.937 --> 26:26.611
Something was blinking
on his shoulder.

26:27.579 --> 26:29.446
It's him.

26:29.447 --> 26:31.417
Why do you reckon?

26:31.418 --> 26:34.766
He videotaped all the girls' murders
and sent them to the police.

26:38.900 --> 26:40.834
Where was the last girl took from?

26:40.835 --> 26:42.646
Miami.

26:45.112 --> 26:48.687
Make this thing look
for missing girls in Miami.

27:25.890 --> 27:27.861
Hey.

27:27.862 --> 27:30.743
You okay?

27:31.234 --> 27:32.943
Yeah.

27:34.507 --> 27:36.677
My stomach hurts.

27:36.678 --> 27:38.950
I can't take all this death stuff
while I'm grieving.

27:38.951 --> 27:42.155
- Stephen, you got a car?
- Of course.

27:42.156 --> 27:44.261
I think we all go
to the sheriffs station.

27:44.262 --> 27:46.598
It could be too late by the time
city police get here.

27:46.599 --> 27:49.971
No way. No way.
I'm not getting murdered tonight, thanks.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.942
I got a funeral tomorrow.
I have a lot of stuff to do.

27:52.943 --> 27:55.649
Someone has to stay here, right,
in case the cops come?

27:55.650 --> 27:57.853
I think we're safer in a group.
Trust me,

27:57.854 --> 28:00.425
you don't want this guy to come knocking
with you here alone.

28:00.426 --> 28:01.961
I understand.

28:01.962 --> 28:04.668
Look, he's probably already seen
my truck by now.

28:04.669 --> 28:08.119
I think you're in this
whether you like it or not.

28:12.617 --> 28:15.056
Can't this thing go any faster?

28:15.057 --> 28:17.827
No no, I had an accelerator governor
put in for mother.

28:17.828 --> 28:22.177
She was a bit of a speed demon.
It won't go past 40.

28:25.206 --> 28:27.612
That's it? That's all you got?

28:27.613 --> 28:30.720
We're at a police station.
Why are we getting weapons?

28:32.021 --> 28:36.026
Get the tire stick.

28:36.027 --> 28:39.446
And I got some tire sealant.
Maybe we can jam it in his ears.

29:00.790 --> 29:04.296
Hey, Sheriff Bates.

29:24.536 --> 29:27.142
Stephen: Um, maybe...

29:30.448 --> 29:33.520
Sheriff, are you there?
It's Tucker Smith.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.958
This is Sheriff Bates.

29:35.959 --> 29:38.226
Yeah, Sheriff.
It's me, Tuck.

29:38.227 --> 29:41.068
I can hear you.

29:41.069 --> 29:44.942
We got a crazy person here
and he's... he's killed some folks.

29:44.943 --> 29:46.646
We need help.
Do you copy?

29:46.647 --> 29:50.152
I hit him with my car.
He killed my deputy.

29:50.153 --> 29:52.999
I'm locked in the supply closet.

29:58.803 --> 30:03.153
Um, I think you guys are good, so...

30:21.614 --> 30:24.120
Dead.

30:24.687 --> 30:27.671
They aren't all dead.

30:33.804 --> 30:35.874
Sheriff.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.375
That ain't Bates.

30:37.376 --> 30:40.362
Sheriff, tell me where you're at.
We'll come get you.

30:41.118 --> 30:44.033
I'm locked in the supply closet.

30:45.492 --> 30:48.064
I hit him with my car.

30:48.065 --> 30:50.949
He killed my deputy.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.522
I can do it, Mom.

30:58.752 --> 31:03.595
This is Sheriff Bates.

31:03.596 --> 31:05.532
Stephen: Hey. Hey, we're good.

31:05.533 --> 31:08.174
There's no sheriff in here.

31:23.903 --> 31:26.010
- Come on!
- Come on.

31:31.684 --> 31:34.259
Come on.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.645
Hey!

31:40.936 --> 31:44.544
Tucker: No no no no!
God damn it!

31:54.329 --> 31:56.572
Come on!

31:57.135 --> 32:01.519
Get back here.
Come on.

32:03.881 --> 32:06.990
- Come on.
- He's coming. He's coming.

32:16.470 --> 32:19.283
Princess: Go.

32:20.381 --> 32:23.585
- Why did he have the camera?
- Just drive, Stephen.

32:23.586 --> 32:26.057
I think we should go back
to his house

32:26.058 --> 32:28.762
- and wait for the city cops to come.
- She's right. She's right.

32:28.763 --> 32:31.068
You're both crazy.
He'll trap us in there.

32:31.069 --> 32:33.173
- How much gas you got?
- About an eighth of a tank.

32:33.174 --> 32:35.911
Let's head towards town.
We don't stop for anything.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.516
No no, we don't have enough gas
for getting into town.

32:38.517 --> 32:40.552
We can go to the holler.
We can make the market.

32:40.553 --> 32:42.122
No, we head towards town.

32:42.123 --> 32:46.228
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

32:46.229 --> 32:48.133
Stop the car now. Stop.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.479
- No, we don't stop for nothing.
- Stop!

32:52.811 --> 32:53.976
What?

32:53.977 --> 32:55.961
There.

32:56.817 --> 32:59.265
That's where I'm from.

33:00.193 --> 33:03.631
No no, I say we just keep on going.
There ain't no reason for us

33:03.632 --> 33:06.546
to go inside there
and let him catch up with us.

33:07.038 --> 33:11.779
I'm pretty sure I'd rather die and rot in hell
than go in there in these circumstances.

33:11.780 --> 33:15.629
I have to remember something.

33:17.525 --> 33:20.439
Stephen: Oh, Jeez.

33:26.308 --> 33:30.084
Roll down the window.

33:30.085 --> 33:31.928
Hold up.

33:33.591 --> 33:35.728
We can't let her go in there
by herself.

33:35.729 --> 33:38.165
She ain't thinking right.

33:38.166 --> 33:41.445
I'm gonna sit here and keep a lookout.
You go with her.

33:42.439 --> 33:45.611
- Go on.
- I can't.

33:45.612 --> 33:46.848
Why not?

33:46.849 --> 33:48.687
My ma's in there.

33:48.688 --> 33:51.559
My ma's in there.
Her funeral is tomorrow...

33:51.560 --> 33:53.593
today. I... I...

33:53.594 --> 33:56.435
I can't go in there
and see her like that.

33:56.436 --> 33:58.772
I can't see her
all sewn up like that.

33:58.773 --> 34:02.145
I'll go with her.
I'm bleeding like a sieve anyway.

34:02.146 --> 34:05.995
Pull the car around back.
Hide it.

34:31.389 --> 34:33.257
Come on.

34:33.257 --> 34:36.069
Come on, come on, come on.

34:36.663 --> 34:39.647
Let's find someplace
to take a look at that arm.

34:41.774 --> 34:44.516
He was right here on the door.

34:57.872 --> 35:01.655
Good job, Princess.
I think you hurt him first.

35:21.918 --> 35:24.834
Woman: I'm not dead!

35:26.261 --> 35:28.608
Guys?

35:32.039 --> 35:35.215
Why are you doing this to me?

35:36.283 --> 35:38.821
Who's there?

35:39.955 --> 35:41.732
Who's there?

35:43.661 --> 35:46.300
All right, all right.

35:46.301 --> 35:49.248
Hold your arm there for me.

35:56.452 --> 35:59.402
You're gonna need
some stitches.

36:05.303 --> 36:08.517
Where have
all the dead people gone?

36:09.146 --> 36:11.687
I ain't got the foggiest.

36:19.066 --> 36:22.515
He's gonna kill me, ain't he?

36:24.677 --> 36:27.592
Hey, look at me.

36:28.649 --> 36:30.553
Nobody...

36:30.554 --> 36:36.031
I mean, nobody else
is gonna die here tonight.

36:38.637 --> 36:41.141
Yes.

36:52.998 --> 36:55.401
Woman: I'm not dead.

36:55.402 --> 36:59.218
You are too dead!
You leave me alone!

37:03.752 --> 37:06.733
You're dead.

37:14.474 --> 37:17.148
Mom, you're dead.

37:20.117 --> 37:22.758
You're dead. You're dead.

37:25.094 --> 37:27.830
Please don't scare me like that,
Mommy, please.

37:27.831 --> 37:30.178
Hey.

37:46.612 --> 37:49.748
Would you guys think I was crazy

37:49.749 --> 37:53.759
if I told you that I saw
my dead mother

37:53.760 --> 37:57.402
floating in a hearse out there?

38:00.470 --> 38:02.976
Okay.

38:44.427 --> 38:46.930
Hey.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.071
Are you all right?

38:51.072 --> 38:55.319
I'm breathing.

38:57.015 --> 39:00.831
I got me a pistol in the house.
I didn't even think to grab it.

39:02.625 --> 39:04.662
I'm just so stupid,
so goddamn stupid.

39:04.663 --> 39:08.947
Hey, it all happened so fast.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.716
Maybe...

39:14.717 --> 39:16.988
maybe I should have
stayed dead.

39:16.989 --> 39:21.732
You wasn't dead, all right?
So stop saying that nonsense.

39:21.733 --> 39:24.370
And it's a coffin or a casket.
It ain't...

39:24.371 --> 39:26.939
ain't no such goddamn thing
as a "dead box. "

39:26.940 --> 39:31.048
And dead people don't float around.
They're just fucking dead.

39:31.049 --> 39:32.183
Hey, man.

39:32.184 --> 39:34.687
I'm sorry, I just...

39:34.688 --> 39:37.025
I guess I'm still
kinda confused.

39:37.026 --> 39:40.671
Well, snap out of it.

39:47.981 --> 39:51.925
We just gotta hold on
a little more than 3 hours, okay?

39:51.926 --> 39:54.495
Why? What happens then?

39:54.496 --> 39:57.502
Well, my brother-in-law, for one...
he happens then.

39:57.503 --> 40:00.206
He's gonna be at my house
at 6:00 AM sharp.

40:00.207 --> 40:02.243
But you're not there.

40:02.244 --> 40:03.779
Right.

40:05.117 --> 40:07.321
Just Cindy.

40:07.322 --> 40:11.260
I can't... I can't let him
see his sister like that.

40:11.261 --> 40:13.632
We gotta go back.

40:13.633 --> 40:15.503
We gotta cover her up.

40:15.504 --> 40:17.805
I really don't want
to leave here.

40:17.806 --> 40:21.148
I feel like if I stay a bit...

40:21.149 --> 40:23.685
I might remember something.

40:23.686 --> 40:27.325
And I'd rather not move, ever.

40:27.326 --> 40:30.664
Well, all right then.
You stay here with the girl.

40:30.665 --> 40:33.371
The keys are inside here.
I'm gonna lock that door.

40:33.372 --> 40:36.046
You make sure you don't open it
unless you know it's me.

40:41.653 --> 40:44.568
Lock the door, please.

40:51.541 --> 40:54.581
Great idea.
Make sure that's locked.

40:55.314 --> 40:57.450
Whoa whoa.

40:57.451 --> 41:00.589
Princess, you're not thinking clearly.
That is not a good idea.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.994
We've got a few weapons, right?

41:02.995 --> 41:05.634
We've got the tire stick
that you hit him with.

41:05.635 --> 41:07.604
The stupidest thing
I've ever done.

41:07.605 --> 41:11.520
We've got the knife
that Tucker found in there.

41:12.550 --> 41:15.395
And we have this.

41:17.524 --> 41:20.163
Okay, fine. Fine.

41:20.164 --> 41:22.131
I don't understand.

41:22.132 --> 41:25.915
I think it's my turn
to take something from him.

41:43.608 --> 41:46.145
He's strong. He's got a lotta stuff
to kill people.

41:46.146 --> 41:48.184
I don't know,
I'd say he has the advantage,

41:48.185 --> 41:50.922
not to mention the car
which helps him a lot.

41:50.923 --> 41:53.661
And he's probably got
a lot of gas in it as well.

41:53.662 --> 41:56.733
Oh my God, what if he comes back
before Tucker does?

41:56.734 --> 41:58.271
We'll be fine.

41:58.272 --> 42:01.120
How? How?

42:02.882 --> 42:05.249
Look,

42:05.250 --> 42:07.889
you don't know
what it's like to wake...

42:07.890 --> 42:11.431
wake up in that thing.

42:11.432 --> 42:16.509
I must have a mom who loves me
and wants me home.

42:59.267 --> 43:01.573
Stephen: It's not Tucker, is it?

43:01.574 --> 43:04.443
Princess: No, it's him.

43:04.444 --> 43:07.886
Stephen: He's been there all along.

43:07.887 --> 43:09.987
Looks like we're gonna have to abort.

43:09.988 --> 43:12.863
Flag on the play.
He's not coming in here.

43:12.864 --> 43:17.838
Princess: No, we're going in there.

43:23.985 --> 43:27.627
No. No. No.

44:16.253 --> 44:19.091
Princess! Prin... hey!

44:19.092 --> 44:21.971
No no no no.
Over here. Over here.

44:22.934 --> 44:24.534
Me. Me.

44:24.535 --> 44:26.739
Hey hey hey. Me.

44:26.740 --> 44:29.655
No no no. No!

44:41.537 --> 44:43.640
Princess!

45:48.869 --> 45:51.874
Help me. Help me.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.009
He's coming. Please help me!

45:54.013 --> 45:56.413
Help me, please. Please.

45:56.414 --> 45:58.884
Please help me. Please.

45:58.885 --> 46:01.257
He's coming.
Don't let him put me back.

46:01.258 --> 46:03.994
Don't let him put me back.
I want to go home.

46:03.995 --> 46:06.167
Shh.

46:06.168 --> 46:07.870
- Please help me.
- I'm sorry.

46:07.871 --> 46:10.253
- Help me!
- Shh.

46:15.086 --> 46:16.759
No! No!

46:20.228 --> 46:22.439
I'm sorry. I'll get us help.

46:31.015 --> 46:32.552
No. No.

46:32.553 --> 46:35.094
Help!

46:36.559 --> 46:38.497
Princess: No.

46:38.498 --> 46:40.741
No!

46:41.803 --> 46:43.444
No!

47:08.722 --> 47:11.263
No!

47:30.936 --> 47:33.437
Princess?

47:48.469 --> 47:51.841
Woman: No!

47:51.842 --> 47:54.381
No!

49:50.996 --> 49:53.164
And there's these windows,
but they're kind of high up.

49:53.165 --> 49:55.202
- I don't know where he is, so...
- All right.

49:55.203 --> 49:58.041
All you had to do was watch her,
just keep her safe.

49:58.042 --> 50:00.981
Don't blame me. You're the one
who yelled at her and left.

50:00.982 --> 50:03.385
I don't know, she said
she had to take something.

50:03.386 --> 50:05.629
I don't know.

50:06.558 --> 50:09.097
Come on, let's go.

50:19.850 --> 50:22.356
Princess on tape: Are you from...?

50:22.357 --> 50:25.169
Are you from the police?

50:49.712 --> 50:52.248
Son of a bitch.

51:05.073 --> 51:08.455
Jesus Christ.

51:11.588 --> 51:15.401
- Which one's she in?
- I don't know. I can't look.

51:27.319 --> 51:29.487
Is it her? Is it her?

51:29.488 --> 51:31.724
No. Sick motherfucker.

51:31.725 --> 51:34.231
Come on.

51:41.213 --> 51:43.148
Oh my God.

51:43.149 --> 51:44.851
- Come on, back there.
- Back there?

51:44.852 --> 51:46.823
You've got to be careful.
I don't know if you hit him.

51:46.824 --> 51:49.094
I hit him at least once.

51:49.095 --> 51:51.062
Well, then where is he?

51:51.063 --> 51:53.740
Oh, God help us.

51:54.372 --> 51:56.544
Stay alert.

51:57.076 --> 52:00.582
We're gonna find the girl first,
then we'll look for him.

52:00.583 --> 52:03.191
This time I'll make sure
to put a bullet in his ass.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.797
Jesus Christ.

52:07.832 --> 52:09.903
Come on.

52:12.006 --> 52:14.181
We're too late.

52:16.015 --> 52:18.048
- Is she dead?
- She's alive. She's alive.

52:18.049 --> 52:21.092
Here, reload the gun.

52:21.691 --> 52:23.867
Hold on, girl.
We're coming.

52:35.986 --> 52:38.399
Oh.

52:42.029 --> 52:45.134
- Are you sure you hit him?
- I'm pretty sure.

52:45.135 --> 52:47.207
Pretty sure?

52:58.731 --> 53:00.666
Hey.

53:00.667 --> 53:03.436
Come on, come on.

53:03.437 --> 53:06.683
- Hey, Princess.
- We thought we lost you.

53:11.088 --> 53:13.692
Guys,

53:13.693 --> 53:16.767
we're outta here.

53:18.103 --> 53:19.368
Wow.

53:19.369 --> 53:22.284
Oh, hey, here I am.

53:26.719 --> 53:29.634
Nobody's home.

53:42.020 --> 53:44.357
- Oh, God.
- Look what I've found.

53:44.358 --> 53:47.563
Fire that puppy up.
Call 911.

53:47.564 --> 53:51.812
Heck, I'm calling everybody.
Are you kidding?

53:53.009 --> 53:56.281
This is one of those Chinese ones,
'cause it's really advanced, really fancy.

53:56.282 --> 53:59.231
If you use...

54:00.692 --> 54:03.164
- Oh, sugar.
- What now?

54:03.165 --> 54:05.199
It needs some sort of a password
to make a call.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.688
Jesus Christ. That figures.

54:09.745 --> 54:12.728
- What do we do now?
- Die.

54:16.257 --> 54:20.066
No, D-I-E... "die. "

54:20.067 --> 54:23.051
- Good good.
- Okay okay.

54:24.308 --> 54:27.052
No, huh-uh.

54:27.685 --> 54:30.823
"Coffin" or "casket. "

54:30.824 --> 54:32.291
Good good good.

54:32.292 --> 54:33.829
No.

54:33.830 --> 54:37.281
No. Try the next one.

54:40.813 --> 54:43.318
No, still not good.

55:10.377 --> 55:13.581
- I think I know what it is.
- All ears back here.

55:13.582 --> 55:16.124
"Chrome skull. "

55:24.372 --> 55:26.878
Craptacular.
That was a good one too.

55:44.419 --> 55:46.758
"Thank you for contacting
the 911 emergency website.

55:46.759 --> 55:49.297
Your emergency is important to us
and will be handled in the order

55:49.298 --> 55:51.869
it was received. If this is a life-threatening
situation, please call 911

55:51.870 --> 55:54.284
or your local law enforcement. "

56:19.463 --> 56:21.569
We may have a problem.

56:26.112 --> 56:28.146
Why don't we
just head towards town?

56:28.147 --> 56:30.484
Hell, we got us a car. Ain't like he can
chase us now, right?

56:30.485 --> 56:33.627
Yeah, but my car is there.
He can use that.

56:33.628 --> 56:37.901
I hope to God he does, 'cause just like us
he ain't gonna make it far in your car.

56:37.902 --> 56:40.039
The smartest thing for us to do
is to go to Moreland's.

56:40.040 --> 56:42.579
We can stock up on bullets.
We can use the phone

56:42.580 --> 56:44.450
and finally get some five-oh
on the way.

56:44.451 --> 56:47.355
Look, pop the trunk. Let me see
if there's anything else we can use,

56:47.356 --> 56:49.862
maybe another cell phone.

56:51.332 --> 56:54.336
Check the glove compartment too.

56:59.514 --> 57:01.352
What do you see?

57:01.353 --> 57:03.460
Nothing good.

57:40.602 --> 57:43.279
Are you from the police?

57:50.892 --> 57:54.668
Look here, it's not my fault.

57:54.669 --> 57:57.040
I told you folks are starting
to complain

57:57.041 --> 58:00.246
about the stink coming from there.
You understand me?

58:00.247 --> 58:01.848
Do you know what I had
to tell Bates?

58:01.849 --> 58:04.821
I had to tell him I had no keys.
Do you know what he told me?

58:04.822 --> 58:08.364
He'll be back in the morning.
He wants in.

58:08.365 --> 58:10.536
You ain't gotta look, okay?

58:10.537 --> 58:14.742
Okay, we just need
to lift these inside,

58:14.743 --> 58:17.149
just get them inside.

58:17.150 --> 58:18.921
All right?

58:18.922 --> 58:22.461
And this shit...
this shit ain't part of the deal.

58:22.462 --> 58:23.997
You got it? Not at all.

58:23.998 --> 58:27.404
I ain't never had one of them
jump at me,

58:27.405 --> 58:29.442
never, not in my house.

58:29.443 --> 58:32.553
You're supposed to keep that shit
up there.

58:34.118 --> 58:36.422
Women's voices: Bring her out.
I'll take care of the piggy.

58:36.423 --> 58:39.498
And the other piggy?

58:40.335 --> 58:44.074
- Can you do this?
- I don't know if I can do this.

58:44.075 --> 58:46.445
God damn you.
This is gonna cost you extra.

58:46.446 --> 58:49.953
It's gonna cost you
a whole lot extra, you understand me?

58:49.954 --> 58:54.629
And I want you to get them all...
all off my land tonight.

58:54.630 --> 58:57.637
God damn it.

59:12.100 --> 59:15.075
All right, now don't worry.
Don't worry.

59:15.076 --> 59:18.682
I gotta get the right key.
I'll get you out of there, don't worry.

59:18.683 --> 59:22.689
- I just gotta find the right key.
- Hurry up.

59:35.351 --> 59:38.324
- Oh, God.
- Come on, pull it together, man.

59:38.325 --> 59:42.733
He cut my mother up. I saw my mom.
He cut my mom. He cut her all up.

59:42.734 --> 59:45.640
How long is it gonna take
to get to the market?

59:45.641 --> 59:48.679
Please please, can't you see
what we're doing here?

59:48.680 --> 59:49.950
Can't you give us a break?

59:49.951 --> 59:52.756
We ain't going to that market,
all right?

59:52.757 --> 59:55.058
We're gonna hold out here
until dawn.

59:55.059 --> 59:57.632
Then we're gonna drive to my house
and meet my brother-in-law.

59:57.633 --> 01:00:00.103
He's got one of them phones
and it don't need a code to call.

01:00:00.104 --> 01:00:03.076
Come on, get ready.

01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:04.981
One...

01:00:04.982 --> 01:00:07.420
Tucker: Put the camera down.

01:00:07.421 --> 01:00:10.493
Would you put the camera down
and get in the car?

01:00:10.494 --> 01:00:13.197
If you ain't gonna help out,
just be quiet

01:00:13.198 --> 01:00:16.878
When I come back
I want that goddamn camera.

01:00:17.643 --> 01:00:20.048
Come on. Just don't look.

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:23.964
- I can't do it.
- One, two, three.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.682
It's all right.

01:00:35.683 --> 01:00:38.223
It's dead anyway.

01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:26.021
Oh, no.

01:01:32.528 --> 01:01:34.999
Stephen: Where do you think
she's headed?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.905
Tucker: She seems fit to see
them pictures on that camera.

01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:40.444
Stephen: I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

01:01:40.445 --> 01:01:43.151
Tucker: Come on,
pick up the pace.

01:01:43.152 --> 01:01:45.052
If we can make it back
to the funeral home

01:01:45.053 --> 01:01:47.592
your car should get us
down to the market.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.652
<i>Man on radio: # The Baptist Jesus
and the Catholic Jesus #</i>

01:01:59.653 --> 01:02:02.290
<i># And the Jesus
up on Broadway... #</i>

01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:06.197
You reckon she can find the market
with that dash map thing?

01:02:06.198 --> 01:02:10.008
Yeah, most likely.

01:02:10.009 --> 01:02:14.448
Tucker: Does that mean
he can see where she's headed?

01:02:14.449 --> 01:02:16.329
Afraid so.

01:02:40.774 --> 01:02:44.716
<i>¶ Sexy bitches are my favorite
kind of bitches ¶</i>

01:02:44.717 --> 01:02:46.817
<i>¶ Sexy bitches are
my favorite kind of bitches... ¶</i>

01:02:46.818 --> 01:02:49.256
Stephen: It's him! It's him! Hey!

01:02:49.257 --> 01:02:51.696
- What the f...?
- Get a car.

01:02:51.697 --> 01:02:55.003
- Fucking douche bags in the dark and shit.
- With a fucking crowbar.

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:57.214
- Yeah, did you see that?
- Who cares?

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:17.259
Hey.

01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:46.682
<i>¶ Sexy bitches are my favorite
kind of bitches ¶</i>

01:03:46.683 --> 01:03:48.789
<i>¶ Sexy bitches... ¶</i>

01:03:54.132 --> 01:03:57.272
Hey. Hey.

01:03:57.273 --> 01:03:58.873
Please help.

01:03:58.874 --> 01:04:01.012
Hey, in here.

01:04:01.013 --> 01:04:05.229
<i>¶ Sexy bitches are my favorite
kind of bitches. ¶</i>

01:04:09.164 --> 01:04:12.114
Thank goodness
my dogs are barking.

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:17.092
- Oh, no.
- Come on, let's go.

01:04:37.994 --> 01:04:40.061
No!

01:04:40.062 --> 01:04:41.975
No! No!

01:04:53.425 --> 01:04:57.072
No. God.

01:05:14.136 --> 01:05:16.677
Oh, God.

01:05:25.326 --> 01:05:27.866
Jesus, what is this? Is everybody
nutty in this fucking hick town?

01:05:27.867 --> 01:05:30.806
Look at me. I'm a hot girl
in a nice car. Honk-honk.

01:05:30.807 --> 01:05:32.710
Look at my tits.
Look at my tits.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.816
Look at me.
Honk-honk, honk-honk.

01:05:34.817 --> 01:05:36.887
I don't even know where we are
anymore, to be honest.

01:05:36.888 --> 01:05:39.223
Where we are? We are...

01:05:39.224 --> 01:05:43.367
gonna have a blast
at the fucking rave.

01:05:43.368 --> 01:05:46.146
- We need beer.
- Shit, beer.

01:06:10.793 --> 01:06:14.004
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:21.954
But I should take this one inside
to see what kind to get.

01:06:33.611 --> 01:06:36.149
Women's voices: This little piggy
went to the market.

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:38.128
This one stayed home.

01:06:43.304 --> 01:06:46.310
I know, I know.
I'm sorry about the speed governor.

01:06:46.311 --> 01:06:48.349
It's just I didn't want my mom
to get hurt.

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.187
She would fly through the holler
like a bat out of hell.

01:06:51.188 --> 01:06:55.371
I promise you, pedal to the metal,
we'll get there.

01:07:17.613 --> 01:07:19.884
You got any more
of these sixers?

01:07:19.885 --> 01:07:22.324
- Yeah, like a lot more.
- Yeah, I got lots,

01:07:22.325 --> 01:07:24.861
but I can't sell you any of it.

01:07:24.862 --> 01:07:27.234
I got this.

01:07:27.235 --> 01:07:30.707
No need to worry, my friend.
We have a lovely little ID.

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:33.413
That ain't it.

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:35.751
It's the law.
Sunday... no alcohol sales.

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:40.059
So you're telling me it's a dry county
and you got booze for sale?

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.698
It ain't dry. It's moist.

01:07:42.699 --> 01:07:44.902
- Moist?
- What the fuck is moist?

01:07:44.903 --> 01:07:48.646
It means we got rules.
I can get a big fine for that.

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:52.554
All right, dude,
let's talk turkey, okay?

01:07:52.555 --> 01:07:55.393
I'm assuming that this place
is owned by your family, right?

01:07:55.394 --> 01:07:56.930
- Yeah, my daddy.
- His daddy.

01:07:56.931 --> 01:07:59.848
Shut up. So where is he?

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:06.549
- Come on, man.
- Excuse me.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.756
- I just...
- Hey, baby.

01:08:08.757 --> 01:08:11.593
I saw you outside
trying to get our attention.

01:08:11.594 --> 01:08:15.304
Here's the thing... we don't want
to get trashed in the car.

01:08:15.305 --> 01:08:18.078
Tommy and I are getting ready to go
to Hotlanta for an all-week rave.

01:08:18.078 --> 01:08:20.379
- You want to come with us?
- ... friends we're meeting there.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.018
Your dad's never gonna
know about it, man.

01:08:22.019 --> 01:08:24.756
She wants to come with us.

01:08:24.758 --> 01:08:28.734
That's great. I think we gotta put back
the fucking beer.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.685
Howdy, ma'am.
How are you doing tonight?

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:41.492
It's been a hell of a night.

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:43.331
Is there anything
I can get for you?

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:48.709
I'll take one of those
little videotapes.

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.746
What for?

01:08:50.747 --> 01:08:54.020
You making a movie
or something?

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.059
Something like that.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.363
Well, is it gonna be
a good movie?

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:02.578
I think that'll be it for me.

01:09:19.441 --> 01:09:21.345
No.

01:09:21.345 --> 01:09:23.617
- Tommy: Oh, shit.
- Princess: No no no.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.188
You shouldn't go.
You can't go out there.

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:27.636
What's going on?
What the fuck is happening?

01:09:27.636 --> 01:09:29.457
Princess: Don't go.

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:32.066
Shit.

01:09:32.865 --> 01:09:36.573
This here is private property,
so why don't you get the fuck off?

01:09:36.575 --> 01:09:38.611
- You gotta go. You gotta go now.
- No no.

01:09:38.612 --> 01:09:41.058
- Just leave me.
- Tell me what's going on. What happened?

01:09:42.653 --> 01:09:44.999
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

01:09:45.725 --> 01:09:49.142
Anthony, go call the cops.
Call the cops, come on.

01:09:50.169 --> 01:09:52.841
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right. It's all right.

01:09:52.843 --> 01:09:54.847
Did you get 'em?

01:09:59.889 --> 01:10:02.463
I don't know what he looks like.
He's got a mask on.

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:05.970
What are you doing?

01:10:05.971 --> 01:10:08.474
- Lock the door. Lock the door.
- Do it.

01:10:08.475 --> 01:10:11.514
Are you after that girl right there?
You think you're going in there to get her?

01:10:11.515 --> 01:10:13.622
Is that what you think?

01:10:14.456 --> 01:10:16.056
How's the dude gonna
get back in?

01:10:16.057 --> 01:10:18.594
What do you not understand?
I will shoot you in the head.

01:10:18.595 --> 01:10:20.237
He's not.

01:10:21.069 --> 01:10:22.948
Oh, shit.

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:37.168
- Hey, where are you going?
- Checking to see if that's the only way in.

01:10:37.169 --> 01:10:38.946
Hurry up.

01:11:12.178 --> 01:11:14.216
No no no, please don't go, please.

01:11:14.217 --> 01:11:16.387
Shh. Anthony?

01:11:16.388 --> 01:11:19.803
Anthony, are you all right?

01:11:24.006 --> 01:11:27.216
Princess, let me in.

01:11:27.946 --> 01:11:29.520
Anthony?

01:11:37.701 --> 01:11:39.940
Me and Anthony... we passed these guys
down the road.

01:11:39.941 --> 01:11:42.579
I don't trust them.
We shouldn't let them in.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.280
I trust them. Let them in.

01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:46.186
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:11:46.187 --> 01:11:48.623
- Princess, let us in.
- Princess?

01:11:48.624 --> 01:11:51.574
Princess, let us in.

01:11:56.109 --> 01:11:59.112
I'm so sorry.
I was so stupid.

01:11:59.113 --> 01:12:01.152
What were you thinking, eh?

01:12:01.153 --> 01:12:02.420
- Who the hell are you?
- What?

01:12:02.421 --> 01:12:03.992
- Is that your car out there?
- Yes.

01:12:03.993 --> 01:12:05.893
You passed us on the street.
Why didn't you stop for us?

01:12:05.894 --> 01:12:09.337
Look at you. Would you stop?
You're walking with a fucking tire iron.

01:12:09.338 --> 01:12:12.577
- Is that your friend out there?
- No.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:15.081
Shit. Anthony?

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:18.688
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about the car.

01:12:18.689 --> 01:12:21.195
It's all right. It's okay.

01:12:41.307 --> 01:12:44.111
Anthony's gone.

01:12:44.112 --> 01:12:48.154
There's just a lot of blood.

01:12:50.758 --> 01:12:53.674
And this.

01:13:01.848 --> 01:13:04.153
We called the cops,
so they should be coming...

01:13:04.154 --> 01:13:07.466
Yeah? Let me know
how that works out for you.

01:13:08.698 --> 01:13:12.270
Listen up, y'all. We gotta find
anything we can to hurt this fucker.

01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:14.409
We're holding our ground.

01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:17.648
Someone would be coming up
pretty quick. The cops known we're here.

01:13:17.649 --> 01:13:20.063
I think it's our best chance.

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:40.771
Look, man, I can't find anything.
All I got is this tire sealant.

01:13:48.114 --> 01:13:50.758
They ain't got no 45s.

01:13:58.505 --> 01:14:01.578
Hey, this is cyanoacrylate.

01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:04.049
Is it good?

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:07.725
The superest of all glues,

01:14:07.726 --> 01:14:09.860
invented during the war

01:14:09.861 --> 01:14:12.848
to glue soldiers' wound together.

01:14:14.372 --> 01:14:16.310
When I was 18
I was building a tank model

01:14:16.311 --> 01:14:18.847
and a tiny drop of this fell on my leg
and it burned and smoked

01:14:18.848 --> 01:14:22.288
like nobody's business.
Then it fused a piece of my PJs to my leg.

01:14:22.289 --> 01:14:23.960
How did you get it off?

01:14:23.961 --> 01:14:26.666
A doctor had to cut it off.

01:14:26.667 --> 01:14:29.207
I still have the scar.

01:15:01.575 --> 01:15:04.650
Girl's voice: You didn't tell me
you were making a movie.

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:11.259
Stephen: Shit.

01:15:20.248 --> 01:15:23.254
- No, don't.
- It's okay.

01:15:43.396 --> 01:15:45.378
Shit.

01:15:52.619 --> 01:15:55.123
No no no, you'll hit the ammo.

01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.635
You go around front now.

01:16:00.636 --> 01:16:03.084
And don't you leave
till she comes out that door.

01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:10.097
Aw, screw it. Cover your eyes.

01:16:13.062 --> 01:16:15.271
No!

01:16:26.556 --> 01:16:29.394
- Go with the kid.
- No.

01:16:29.395 --> 01:16:31.599
- Go with the kid.
- No.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.638
- Go on, go.
- No.

01:16:33.639 --> 01:16:36.645
No, you tried
and he's not gonna stop,

01:16:36.646 --> 01:16:39.391
ever. Just let me go.

01:16:40.219 --> 01:16:42.828
Just let me go.

01:16:43.995 --> 01:16:48.209
If things don't go my way,
you're somebody great.

01:16:50.409 --> 01:16:53.084
Don't you forget that again.

01:17:02.135 --> 01:17:04.637
No.

01:17:06.777 --> 01:17:09.315
No.

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:17.199
No.

01:17:23.012 --> 01:17:25.653
Oh, God.

01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:31.637
No!

01:17:46.396 --> 01:17:48.276
No.

01:17:50.839 --> 01:17:53.178
No no no.

01:17:53.179 --> 01:17:54.818
No.

01:18:19.399 --> 01:18:21.237
I know who you are.

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.610
I know your name.

01:18:23.611 --> 01:18:26.423
Hey, guys, come on.

01:19:02.224 --> 01:19:05.163
Nice place.

01:19:05.164 --> 01:19:08.105
You buy or lease?

01:19:08.106 --> 01:19:12.854
Hey, you don't mind if I use your bed
before we use your bed, do you?

01:19:16.322 --> 01:19:19.172
Not much of a talker, are you?

01:19:22.169 --> 01:19:24.675
You don't mind?

01:19:37.701 --> 01:19:40.206
Come here.

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:44.727
Come a little bit closer.

01:19:47.156 --> 01:19:50.367
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:19:51.968 --> 01:19:55.741
Now I know you only paid
for a blowjob,

01:19:55.742 --> 01:19:58.279
but don't you want
a little bit more?

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.856
Have you ever had
a Swedish blowjob?

01:20:11.275 --> 01:20:14.054
Hey...

01:20:15.885 --> 01:20:18.221
you didn't tell me
you were making a movie.

01:20:18.222 --> 01:20:21.835
That's gonna cost you
a little bit extra.

01:20:24.204 --> 01:20:27.120
I don't mind playing, though.

01:21:04.090 --> 01:21:06.001
Hey!

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.136
I give up.

01:21:10.137 --> 01:21:12.207
I don't care anymore.

01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:14.483
Come and get me.

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:04.052
I love you more than anything.

01:25:32.182 --> 01:25:34.685
Where to?

01:25:39.397 --> 01:25:42.570
Shouldn't we wait
for the cops to come?

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:45.144
I've waited.

01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:51.097
Where to?

01:25:52.359 --> 01:25:54.663
My friend Anthony is in there
and I can't leave...

01:25:54.664 --> 01:25:57.702
I left a note.

01:25:57.703 --> 01:26:00.083
Where're we going?

01:26:02.783 --> 01:26:06.087
Atlanta?

01:26:06.088 --> 01:26:08.628
Atlanta.

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:14.077
Is it nice?

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.459
I think so, yeah.

01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:28.642
Sounds...

01:26:30.776 --> 01:26:33.814
Perfect..!
