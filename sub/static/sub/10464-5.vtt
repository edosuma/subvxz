00:05.739 --> 00:07.300
A what night?

00:07.324 --> 00:09.677
A lounge night. Kind
of a '50s thing.

00:09.701 --> 00:10.928
Whoa.

00:10.952 --> 00:12.680
- Oh, I got you.
- Okay.

00:12.704 --> 00:15.057
Anyway, it'll bring a new
crowd into Salinger's.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.976
You know, the whole
lounge thing is very hip.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.144
If you say so.

00:18.168 --> 00:20.261
Hey, look at her.

00:21.379 --> 00:23.556
What a woman?

00:25.842 --> 00:28.311
If I were you, I'd marry her.

00:28.345 --> 00:29.989
Hey, Kirsten, teach
me how to do that.

00:30.013 --> 00:31.314
<i>Help!</i>

00:32.348 --> 00:34.410
Hey, Bailey! Bailey, slow down.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.653
- Slow down.
- Julia, make him stop!

00:37.062 --> 00:38.414
No warning?

00:38.438 --> 00:40.073
You just walked in,
and he fired you.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.335
Well, did he at least
give you a reason?

00:42.359 --> 00:44.661
Something about my attitude.

00:45.528 --> 00:46.839
He expects me to
treat every customer

00:46.863 --> 00:48.591
like they're my best
friend or something.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.301
I don't know. Who cares?

00:50.325 --> 00:51.761
Well, maybe if you apologized...

00:51.785 --> 00:53.638
To him? Forget it.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.838
He should be apologizing to me.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.144
So you wanna blow
this place, or what?

01:00.168 --> 01:01.687
Oh, my God!

01:01.711 --> 01:03.346
Whoa!

01:06.466 --> 01:08.101
Pick me up!

01:16.935 --> 01:18.319

I'm not saying you
did it on purpose.

01:58.435 --> 01:59.954
No, just saying it was my fault.

01:59.978 --> 02:01.038
You did start it, Bay.

02:01.062 --> 02:03.290
Hey, Claud, what you
doing there, kiddo?

02:03.314 --> 02:05.825
If you just squint
and go like this...

02:06.026 --> 02:09.662
Hey, it looks like one
of those flying worms.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.040
What did they give her?

02:12.073 --> 02:13.499
Darvax.

02:13.616 --> 02:15.011
Charlie, maybe you should...

02:15.035 --> 02:16.502
Claud, come on.

02:17.662 --> 02:19.172
Time for bed.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.593
You're so tall, Charlie. I mean,

02:24.294 --> 02:25.595
you're, like, 18 feet tall.

02:26.129 --> 02:27.388
What the hell?

02:28.590 --> 02:29.567
Oh, that must be

02:29.591 --> 02:30.943
from one of Charlie's friends.

02:30.967 --> 02:33.112
And you're hairy too.

02:33.136 --> 02:35.281
Lots and lots and lots of hair.

02:35.305 --> 02:36.615
Bingo.

02:40.351 --> 02:41.704
You know, Kirsten, there
are guys out there

02:41.728 --> 02:42.955
with friends who have taste.

02:42.979 --> 02:45.156
Those are the ones to marry.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.494
She okay?

02:51.529 --> 02:53.716
Like she wasn't weird enough.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.291
Hey!

02:55.742 --> 02:57.293
Cool spittoon.

02:58.161 --> 02:59.597
What else did we get?

02:59.621 --> 03:01.932
A couple of gift certificates,

03:01.956 --> 03:03.392
a check

03:03.416 --> 03:06.771
and a reading with Miss Corso,

03:06.795 --> 03:09.690
the San Francisco psychic.

03:09.714 --> 03:11.265
What? Who sent us that?

03:12.091 --> 03:13.976
My Aunt Roberta.

03:14.052 --> 03:16.145
Roberta. She's the one who
just got out of rehab?

03:17.639 --> 03:20.149
The one with the
inner ear problem.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.369
Have I mentioned
how excited I am

03:22.393 --> 03:24.163
about becoming a
member of your family?

03:24.187 --> 03:27.208
<i>♪ Glory, glory ♪</i>

03:27.232 --> 03:28.209

03:28.233 --> 03:30.409
You're one to talk.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.004
Midnight snack?

03:43.581 --> 03:44.725
Band-aids.

03:44.749 --> 03:46.592
I got blisters from the skates.

03:48.336 --> 03:49.762
What are you doing?

03:51.131 --> 03:53.433
Working on this Thursday
lounge-night thing.

03:54.217 --> 03:55.810
It's a cool idea.

03:56.344 --> 03:57.603
Yeah.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.241
So you're probably gonna be

04:00.265 --> 04:01.524
hiring new people, huh

04:01.766 --> 04:03.577
to handle the extra work?

04:03.601 --> 04:05.162
Yeah, which is a drag.

04:05.186 --> 04:06.747
I hate looking for new people.

04:06.771 --> 04:08.823
Yeah.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.702
You know, Griffin's
looking for a job.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.539
I thought he worked
at that bike shop.

04:16.697 --> 04:19.166
Well, he did, but,

04:19.284 --> 04:20.418
he quit.

04:22.954 --> 04:24.974
Yeah, well, in general,

04:24.998 --> 04:26.183
I like to hire people

04:26.207 --> 04:28.227
that have just a little
bit of respect for me,

04:28.251 --> 04:29.854
so I don't think so.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.095
Griffin respects you.

04:31.421 --> 04:32.815
He does.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.725
And once you get to know
him, he's a really good guy.

04:36.134 --> 04:37.862
Look, Jule, I know you like him,

04:37.886 --> 04:40.364
but the guy gives me
nothing but attitude.

04:40.388 --> 04:43.075
Charlie, he only does that
'cause he's intimidated.

04:43.099 --> 04:44.869
He told me he thinks
you're really cool.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.570
He'd love to work for you.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.082
Why would he wanna hire me?
He hates me.

04:50.106 --> 04:52.084
Well, that's just
the brother thing.

04:52.108 --> 04:53.544
I mean, he has to be protective.

04:53.568 --> 04:55.087
But he thinks you're great.

04:55.111 --> 04:58.164
He told me he thought you
had a lot of potential.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.302
Your hair looks cool today.

05:01.326 --> 05:03.095
You know, he'd like having
you around the restaurant

05:03.119 --> 05:04.722
and getting to know you better.

05:04.746 --> 05:05.639
I don't know.

05:05.663 --> 05:07.516
I got this thing about
other people's food,

05:07.540 --> 05:09.727
see, like fat from their steaks.

05:09.751 --> 05:12.521
It's 6.25 an hour, and
if Charlie likes you,

05:12.545 --> 05:14.398
then he'll probably
give you a raise.

05:14.422 --> 05:16.307
I thought he did like me.

05:16.466 --> 05:19.695
Well, no, yeah, he does, but...

05:19.719 --> 05:22.323
Listen, just try it and
see if you like it.

05:22.347 --> 05:23.523
Please?

05:24.599 --> 05:26.327
6.25 an hour?

05:26.351 --> 05:27.944
Plus tips.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.530
I think you two are
really gonna get along.

05:34.776 --> 05:36.462
Well, she's in love with Hamlet,

05:36.486 --> 05:37.922
and she thinks he's in
love with her, too,

05:37.946 --> 05:39.298
so she's psyched, but then...

05:39.322 --> 05:40.424
Just a second.

05:40.448 --> 05:41.467
Yes?

05:41.491 --> 05:44.585
I have a note for Sarah Reeves.

05:46.204 --> 05:48.515
Okay, Sarah, you can
finish that thought later.

05:48.539 --> 05:50.309
Principal Stickley
wants to see you.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.009
Okay.

05:53.836 --> 05:55.972
Okay. Anybody else?

05:56.422 --> 05:57.524
Gina.

05:57.548 --> 05:59.318
What happened?

05:59.342 --> 06:01.362
What happened...

06:01.386 --> 06:04.031
is that the sun came out,

06:04.055 --> 06:05.157
and we're stuck inside.

06:05.181 --> 06:06.492
Wait a minute. Wait, Bailey.

06:06.516 --> 06:08.619
What about Principal Stickley?

06:08.643 --> 06:09.787
What about her?

06:09.811 --> 06:11.372
You forged that note?

06:11.396 --> 06:13.781
Forged. "Forged" is
such an ugly word.

06:13.856 --> 06:16.460
No, really, Bailey, I have a
test on that stuff this week.

06:16.484 --> 06:18.837
So what? So you get
the notes from Dana.

06:18.861 --> 06:20.204
Come on. It'll be great.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.666
Get us in trouble.

06:25.827 --> 06:29.255
To be honest, I feel kind
of silly doing this,

06:29.789 --> 06:31.850
but it is a present
from my aunt,

06:31.874 --> 06:33.185
so I figured...

06:33.209 --> 06:35.229
What the hell? Do it for kicks.

06:35.253 --> 06:36.554
Right.

06:37.714 --> 06:41.986
So you're getting
married in five weeks?

06:42.010 --> 06:43.070
How did you know that?

06:43.094 --> 06:45.563
Your aunt told me when
she got the coupons.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.690
Oh, right.

06:48.433 --> 06:49.827
Well, it's a present
for both of us,

06:49.851 --> 06:51.370
me and my fiancé,

06:51.394 --> 06:53.195
but he's kind of
a skeptic, so...

06:53.229 --> 06:54.915
Okay!

06:54.939 --> 06:56.333
Good things.

06:56.357 --> 06:58.168
Good, good things.

06:58.192 --> 06:59.962
It's a good match.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.214
A very good match.

07:02.238 --> 07:03.257
Really?

07:03.281 --> 07:06.719
Although I can see
why you'd worry.

07:06.743 --> 07:10.514
He was a scoundrel, this one.

07:10.538 --> 07:11.724
Before he knew me.

07:11.748 --> 07:13.142
And during.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.935
Let's be honest.

07:14.959 --> 07:17.479
Okay. And during.

07:17.503 --> 07:21.057
Well, he's got that out
of his system for good.

07:22.133 --> 07:23.652
Oh, yes!

07:23.676 --> 07:27.563
I can see the two of you
dancing at your wedding.

07:27.722 --> 07:28.939
Dancing?

07:31.017 --> 07:33.829
Well, he doesn't really dance.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.205
Well, he will.

07:35.229 --> 07:37.541
You and Rob are gonna have

07:37.565 --> 07:40.127
a long, happy life together.

07:40.151 --> 07:41.786
Um, Charlie.

07:42.111 --> 07:43.297
Excuse me.

07:43.321 --> 07:44.757
His name is Charlie.

07:44.781 --> 07:46.582
No, it's not.

07:46.783 --> 07:47.885
It's Rob.

07:47.909 --> 07:49.678
R-O-B.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.055
Rob.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.380
See?

07:56.501 --> 07:57.561
Is Griffin here yet?

07:57.585 --> 07:59.021
I haven't seen him.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.972
Damn it. He was supposed to
be here three hours ago.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.193
What if I dipped
Tess's hand in ink

08:04.217 --> 08:05.986
and put her hand print on it?

08:06.010 --> 08:08.030
Absolutely not. I'll
sign it for her.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.731
No. I want her to
sign it herself.

08:10.765 --> 08:11.909
Well, I'll tell you what.

08:11.933 --> 08:13.118
What if she spits up on it?

08:13.142 --> 08:14.661
Will that do it for you?

08:14.685 --> 08:16.205
Hey, both kegs need
changing, boss,

08:16.229 --> 08:18.739
and we're about to run out
of glasses behind the bar.

08:18.815 --> 08:20.167
I don't believe this
guy didn't show up.

08:20.191 --> 08:21.418
Have to get a sub.

08:21.442 --> 08:22.669
Hey, Charlie. Could I, uh...

08:22.693 --> 08:24.713
Don't think you'd find the
job satisfying, Ross.

08:24.737 --> 08:27.081
Talk about something
else entirely?

08:28.783 --> 08:30.167
Sorry. Sure.

08:30.201 --> 08:32.669
I was just wondering what the
doctor said about the break.

08:33.328 --> 08:35.307
He said she'd be fine.

08:35.331 --> 08:37.101
You know, no permanent damage.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.145
And he was, like, a specialist
with this kind of stuff?

08:40.169 --> 08:42.763
I mean, he'd worked
with musicians before?

08:42.922 --> 08:44.232
Musicians.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.234
I don't know.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.226
He was just some ER guy. Why?

08:47.844 --> 08:51.772
Well, it's just that sometimes
with a break like this...

08:52.849 --> 08:54.076
I'm not saying definitely,

08:54.100 --> 08:57.246
but there was this guy
I knew in school.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.123
He was a great cellist,

08:59.147 --> 09:01.166
and he broke a bone in his hand.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.126
And when the cast came off,

09:02.150 --> 09:04.744
it turned out he had lost
some muscle control.

09:04.986 --> 09:07.663
Meaning what? Meaning
he couldn't play?

09:08.281 --> 09:10.750
Not as a soloist, no.

09:15.037 --> 09:15.973
Wow.

09:15.997 --> 09:17.516
I'm not saying that's gonna...

09:17.540 --> 09:19.341
No, of course.

09:20.334 --> 09:22.646
We should get a second
opinion, shouldn't we?

09:22.670 --> 09:24.680
Yeah. I'll get the
name of someone good.

09:25.047 --> 09:26.515
Great. That'd be great.

09:27.884 --> 09:29.611
In the meantime...

09:29.635 --> 09:30.612
Not a word.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.396
Thanks.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.526
Tell your boyfriend he's fired.

09:38.269 --> 09:40.998
He never showed, and I
couldn't get a sub.

09:41.022 --> 09:43.500
So instead of doing all the crap
that I have to do for Thursday,

09:43.524 --> 09:44.992
I ended up busing
tables all night.

09:45.443 --> 09:46.962
You really know how
to pick them, Jule.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.298
Charlie, wait. You know what?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.373
It wasn't his fault.
It was mine.

09:52.408 --> 09:54.094
I told him the wrong thing.

09:54.118 --> 09:56.712
I told him that you didn't
need him till next week.

09:57.038 --> 09:58.599
I said I needed someone now.

09:58.623 --> 09:59.600
Really? I thought...

09:59.624 --> 10:00.976
Julia, don't be an idiot, okay?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.227
Hey, don't call me names

10:02.251 --> 10:04.929
because I don't know your
employment needs, okay.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.847
Fine. I'm sorry.
You're not an idiot.

10:06.923 --> 10:09.568
And don't punish Griffin for
something that isn't his fault.

10:09.592 --> 10:11.977
Jeez, no wonder you can't
keep any employees.

10:12.762 --> 10:14.396
I'm sorry, okay?

10:15.515 --> 10:18.150
I'm just a little frazzled.

10:21.437 --> 10:24.532
Just tell Griffin
tomorrow at 5:30, sharp.

10:25.399 --> 10:27.618
5:30. He'll be there.

10:27.652 --> 10:29.338
You know, you really ought
to find a healthy outlet

10:29.362 --> 10:30.579
for all that...

10:31.447 --> 10:32.873
stress.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.216
Wow. Impressive.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.301
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.563
Well, we could go
get some dinner.

10:46.587 --> 10:49.525
We could, or we could stay here

10:49.549 --> 10:52.142
and let delirium set in.

10:58.432 --> 11:00.860
Bailey, what are you doing?

11:01.018 --> 11:02.736
I'm not sure.

11:02.770 --> 11:03.830
Must be that delirium.

11:03.854 --> 11:05.531
Must be.

11:09.694 --> 11:12.663
Bailey, I feel a little funny.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.550
Not to me, you don't.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.585
A little underdressed,
aren't we, kids?

11:17.868 --> 11:19.295
Officer!

11:20.413 --> 11:22.516
Thank God you're here.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.934
Look, Sarah, it's a policeman.

11:23.958 --> 11:25.811
Bailey.

11:25.835 --> 11:26.812
You see,

11:26.836 --> 11:27.854
what happened was

11:27.878 --> 11:29.856
we were just sitting here,

11:29.880 --> 11:31.650
and suddenly Sarah...

11:31.674 --> 11:33.944
Well, you tell him, Sarah.

11:33.968 --> 11:35.112
What?

11:35.136 --> 11:39.157
She felt something in her shirt,

11:39.181 --> 11:41.201
you know, like a spider, maybe.

11:41.225 --> 11:42.327
She's so allergic to spiders.

11:42.351 --> 11:44.496
Tell him how allergic.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.071
Bailey.

11:46.355 --> 11:48.240
Blows up like a...

11:49.066 --> 11:50.284
Like a...

11:54.113 --> 11:55.132
work with me here.

11:55.156 --> 11:57.124
Hey, don't waste my time.

11:57.241 --> 11:58.927
Just get dressed
and head on home.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.711
It's a public park,
not a bedroom.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.630
Yes, sir.

12:08.502 --> 12:09.521
We should go.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.898
No, we can stay.
He doesn't care.

12:11.922 --> 12:12.941
He probably thought
it was funny.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.933
Well that makes two of you.
Can we go, please?

12:24.393 --> 12:27.456
Rob. You don't even
know any Robs.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.239
I did once.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.793
This guy on my floor,
freshman year.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.911
Rob Strapplemeyer.

12:35.237 --> 12:36.997
Sounds like a sausage brand.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.125
I dated him for a month.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.087
Total pig. No neck.

12:43.537 --> 12:44.713
Nice.

12:44.747 --> 12:46.224
Of all the guys I've ever known,

12:46.248 --> 12:48.185
he's the last person
I'd think of marrying.

12:48.209 --> 12:49.551
Weird, huh?

12:50.461 --> 12:51.637
Trippy.

12:52.588 --> 12:57.226
You know, Charlie, I had a thought.
About the wedding?

12:58.135 --> 13:00.521
Well, I was thinking
about the dancing,

13:00.805 --> 13:03.732
because, you know, you and I,
we don't really dance together.

13:04.266 --> 13:06.276
And so my thought was...

13:07.061 --> 13:08.737
Please don't hate me.

13:08.813 --> 13:10.406
I hate you.

13:10.981 --> 13:12.667
Come on. It'll be fun.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.159
It'll get us out of the house.

13:15.653 --> 13:17.287
I'll pay.

13:18.614 --> 13:20.624
You're really gonna make
me take dancing classes?

13:20.991 --> 13:23.001
No, I'm not gonna
make you take them.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.837
I'm gonna ask you.

13:26.622 --> 13:28.674
And you're gonna say yes.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.678
Find anything, Jules?

13:32.753 --> 13:34.564
Strange Indeed.
Ever heard of them?

13:34.588 --> 13:35.941
That could be it. Where
are they playing?

13:35.965 --> 13:36.983
What are you guys talking about?

13:37.007 --> 13:38.985
Trying to track down the
Soul Asylum concert.

13:39.009 --> 13:40.404
Griffin heard they
were in town tonight

13:40.428 --> 13:41.571
under a different name.

13:41.595 --> 13:42.906
Why don't they use their name?

13:42.930 --> 13:44.574
Because. When you're really
huge and play a club,

13:44.598 --> 13:46.451
it's the only way to make sure
it's not gonna be a madhouse.

13:46.475 --> 13:47.994
Oh, I'll have to remember that.

13:48.018 --> 13:49.830
You know, when I'm a
famous violinist.

13:49.854 --> 13:51.957
Yeah, keep that in mind, Claud.
I'm out of here!

13:51.981 --> 13:53.500
Get ready for school, Claud.

13:53.524 --> 13:54.835
We gotta roll.

13:54.859 --> 13:56.378
I don't have to be
there for 45 minutes.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.712
Yeah, but after I drop you off,

13:57.736 --> 13:59.872
I have to go all the way to
Cole Valley to get Jill.

14:00.489 --> 14:01.957
You mean Sarah.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.635
What?

14:03.659 --> 14:05.419
Well, you just called her Jill.

14:05.911 --> 14:06.847
No, I didn't.

14:06.871 --> 14:08.682
I just heard it. You said,

14:08.706 --> 14:10.725
"After I drop you off, I have to
go all the way to Cole Valley... "

14:10.749 --> 14:11.768
I know what I said!

14:11.792 --> 14:13.145
And I know what I heard.

14:13.169 --> 14:15.105
Hey, you've been on
painkillers for two days.

14:15.129 --> 14:16.606
You're not exactly
the best judge.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.608
So get your books or
whatever and get in the car.

14:18.632 --> 14:20.434
Okay, we gotta go.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.692
Used motorcycle helmets?

14:29.393 --> 14:31.737
Yeah, yeah. They're
expensive new.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.790
I thought you had one.

14:33.814 --> 14:36.033
It got stolen. What
are you doing here?

14:36.317 --> 14:37.743
Looking for you.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.871
And so was my
brother last night.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.749
Yeah, yeah.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.135
Things got a little bit crazy.

14:45.159 --> 14:46.794
There was no way.

14:46.911 --> 14:48.013
That's it?

14:48.037 --> 14:50.182
Things got a little crazy?

14:50.206 --> 14:52.883
You know, Charlie was really mad.
He wanted to fire you.

14:55.127 --> 14:57.513
Fired from a job I haven't
even started yet.

14:57.922 --> 14:59.608
There's a first.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.736
I kind of told him
that it was my fault

15:02.760 --> 15:04.269
that you weren't there.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.022
And I convinced him to
give you another shot.

15:07.097 --> 15:08.366
There it is!

15:08.390 --> 15:10.327
Yeah. "Like new. 40 bucks."

15:10.351 --> 15:11.369
Hello?

15:11.393 --> 15:12.662
I told you I saved your butt.

15:12.686 --> 15:14.780
Doesn't that deserve
some kind of reaction?

15:15.105 --> 15:16.416
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.459
Do you have a quarter?

15:17.483 --> 15:19.076
No.

15:19.235 --> 15:21.120
Do you have change for a dollar?

15:22.112 --> 15:24.748
Look, I gotta go make
this phone call.

15:25.074 --> 15:26.301
I'll catch you later, all right?

15:26.325 --> 15:28.043
Yeah.

15:28.244 --> 15:30.806
I think I found the Soul
Asylum show at the Atlas.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.224
So we'll hook up there

15:32.248 --> 15:33.841
when you're finished
at the restaurant.

15:34.124 --> 15:35.509
Sure.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.719
Thanks.

15:40.297 --> 15:42.067
We have an appointment
tomorrow at one.

15:42.091 --> 15:43.985
He needs to make
sure it's set right.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.186
How does he do that? By
looking at the X-ray?

15:47.054 --> 15:49.115
No, I think he'll probably
wanna take another one.

15:49.139 --> 15:50.399
Why?

15:50.808 --> 15:52.693
Why do I need another x-ray?

15:54.353 --> 15:57.823
You know, it just never hurts
to have a second opinion.

15:57.982 --> 15:59.491
But why?

15:59.775 --> 16:01.753
To make sure that
it heals properly.

16:01.777 --> 16:04.005
Everyone said it was
gonna heal properly.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.914
Yeah, and it almost
definitely will.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.583
But not definitely definitely.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.794
Probably definitely definitely.

16:11.745 --> 16:13.839
So, you're not sure?

16:13.998 --> 16:15.141
No, we're sure.

16:15.165 --> 16:16.393
Yeah, we're sure.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.719
- We just wanna be...
- Sure sure.

16:18.919 --> 16:20.429
Sure.

16:41.525 --> 16:42.752
Hey, Julia.

16:42.776 --> 16:44.754
- Hey.
- Where's Bailey?

16:44.778 --> 16:46.705
He's just parking. I'm
holding a place for us.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.844
It's kind of funny
being an "us."

16:50.868 --> 16:52.137
I mean, I guess not for you.

16:52.161 --> 16:54.347
You know, you've been an
"us" before, but for me.

16:54.371 --> 16:55.557
So it's going well?

16:55.581 --> 16:57.007
Yeah. Definitely.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.977
That's great.

16:59.001 --> 17:00.854
It's different,
though, you know?

17:00.878 --> 17:02.188
I kind of thought
it would be like

17:02.212 --> 17:04.523
when we were just
friends, just more.

17:04.548 --> 17:07.359
But now things can
get kind of intense.

17:07.384 --> 17:08.819
It's just different.

17:08.844 --> 17:09.779
But good.

17:09.803 --> 17:11.688
Yeah, yeah. Good. Yeah.

17:11.972 --> 17:13.700
I mean, I guess that
happens all the time?

17:13.723 --> 17:15.827
You know, things change
when you start going out?

17:15.851 --> 17:18.288
Yeah, sure. All the time.

17:18.311 --> 17:21.448
That's what I figured.
Oh, there he is.

17:23.692 --> 17:26.296
So Strange Indeed
really is... Is a band?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.422
A real band?

17:27.445 --> 17:30.290
As opposed to what?

17:33.327 --> 17:34.638
Come on, you guys.
Let's load in.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.296
Okay.

17:37.164 --> 17:38.799
Okay, we have two choices.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.894
We can either sit
around here all night

17:40.918 --> 17:42.020
and whine about the fact

17:42.044 --> 17:44.022
that we're not gonna see a
great show after all...

17:44.046 --> 17:45.065
Tempting.

17:45.089 --> 17:47.391
Or we can see this
as a positive.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.403
A whole night ahead of
us, zero obligations.

17:50.427 --> 17:52.155
We just do whatever
we feel like doin'.

17:52.179 --> 17:53.698
Door number two, Monty.

17:53.722 --> 17:54.908
Jeep's this way.

17:54.932 --> 17:57.243
Shouldn't we tell Julia
where we're going?

17:57.267 --> 17:59.829
But that would
require us knowing

17:59.853 --> 18:01.238
where we were going.

18:03.273 --> 18:05.126
All right, then, dancers!

18:05.150 --> 18:06.910
Let's get started!

18:06.986 --> 18:09.079
Okay.

18:09.405 --> 18:10.956
Charlie.

18:11.615 --> 18:13.927
Think maybe you're holding
her a little too tight?

18:13.951 --> 18:15.470
Am I right, Kirsten?

18:15.494 --> 18:16.753
Yes.

18:17.454 --> 18:19.599
And you're feeling
a little bit of,

18:19.623 --> 18:21.601
"Don't you dare try
to get away from me

18:21.625 --> 18:23.593
'cause if you do,
I'll hunt you down."

18:23.752 --> 18:25.438
Yeah, exactly.

18:25.462 --> 18:29.567
Well, Charlie, what do you
say we loosen up a bit?

18:29.591 --> 18:32.269
Give her a little freedom?

18:32.469 --> 18:35.323
Okay, Kirsten, maybe you could

18:35.347 --> 18:37.733
show Charlie a
little more trust.

18:39.977 --> 18:41.695
Better?

18:41.895 --> 18:43.322
Much.

18:44.565 --> 18:46.001
You kids are cute.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.326
First date?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.466
Okay, here's one.

18:53.490 --> 18:57.387
<i>♪ Sweet dreams Are
made of these ♪</i>

18:57.411 --> 18:59.389
And you thought it was?

18:59.413 --> 19:03.925
<i>♪ Sweet dreams Are
made of cheese ♪</i>

19:05.919 --> 19:09.482
Okay. Left, LA. Right, Seattle.

19:09.506 --> 19:11.058
I'm a Seahawks fan, so right.

19:11.467 --> 19:12.986
Right it is.

19:13.010 --> 19:14.070
I have to confess.

19:14.094 --> 19:15.947
I thought that "I'm every woman"

19:15.971 --> 19:18.158
was "Climb every woman."

19:18.182 --> 19:19.608
What?

19:19.892 --> 19:21.786
You did not!

19:21.810 --> 19:24.622
Where are we going?

19:24.646 --> 19:28.075
Why did you turn here?
This goes to the freeway.

19:28.192 --> 19:29.419
Last time I checked,

19:29.443 --> 19:31.129
this was the fastest
way to Seattle.

19:31.153 --> 19:32.714
You're kidding, right?

19:32.738 --> 19:33.757
No.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.216
We'll just...

19:35.240 --> 19:37.052
take off, you know,
with no plans.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.220
That's when the best stuff
happens, when you just go...

19:39.244 --> 19:42.140
No, Bailey. Come on, this isn't funny.
I have a test.

19:42.164 --> 19:43.683
Right, so you'll make it up.

19:43.707 --> 19:46.269
Or you take an F. Whatever.
Who cares?

19:46.293 --> 19:49.304
I do. I care, and so do my parents.
They'd kill me.

19:49.379 --> 19:50.815
They'll never know.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.109
We'll stop at a pay
phone, and you call them

19:53.133 --> 19:54.819
and tell them that...

19:54.843 --> 19:56.905
Tell them that you're crashing
at Dana's after the show

19:56.929 --> 19:59.365
and gonna go straight to
school in the morning.

19:59.389 --> 20:00.658
We'll be home by tomorrow night.

20:00.682 --> 20:02.160
Bailey, I do not
wanna go to Seattle.

20:02.184 --> 20:04.913
How do you know? You've never been.
Come on!

20:04.937 --> 20:07.832
No, you come on. You can go
wherever you want by yourself.

20:07.856 --> 20:10.492
But I wanna go home, now!

20:10.859 --> 20:12.796
Look, I just thought it
would be fun, all right?

20:12.820 --> 20:14.204
Well, it wouldn't.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.381
Okay.

20:15.405 --> 20:16.674
- Okay.
- Okay!

20:16.698 --> 20:18.667
Okay.

21:01.076 --> 21:02.836
Hey.

21:06.123 --> 21:07.475
You have fun last night?

21:07.499 --> 21:10.436
I didn't stay. I left.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.564
Oh, we did too.

21:12.588 --> 21:14.774
But I guess you saw
Carolyn and me leaving.

21:14.798 --> 21:16.433
I guess.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.572
Did you stick around long?

21:20.596 --> 21:21.865
Waiting?

21:21.889 --> 21:24.357
No. No.

21:25.142 --> 21:26.703
Good.

21:26.727 --> 21:27.745
'Cause I mean, you know,

21:27.769 --> 21:29.289
it's probably not too safe

21:29.313 --> 21:31.583
to hang out in a place
like that at night.

21:31.607 --> 21:32.824
Alone.

21:33.233 --> 21:34.493
Yeah.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.578
You know, Justin,
I gotta go, so...

21:36.945 --> 21:38.371
Alone last night?

21:38.822 --> 21:40.415
Alone today?

21:41.366 --> 21:44.211
You know, ever since you
hooked up with Griffin,

21:44.328 --> 21:45.763
you've been spending
a lot of time alone.

21:45.787 --> 21:47.923
You don't really know what
you're talking about.

21:48.248 --> 21:49.934
I'm sorry.

21:49.958 --> 21:53.730
I don't. It's, just I
wouldn't have stood you up.

21:53.754 --> 21:54.856
But I guess that's why

21:54.880 --> 21:57.641
we're not together any more?

22:00.219 --> 22:01.937
You know,

22:01.970 --> 22:05.450
I wish somebody would tell
me why girls prefer guys

22:05.474 --> 22:07.609
who treat them like garbage,

22:08.393 --> 22:10.862
'cause I just don't get it.

22:23.367 --> 22:25.126
Thought you'd be
in Seattle by now.

22:27.454 --> 22:29.631
The idea wasn't to go alone.

22:31.375 --> 22:32.560
I'm not like that, you know.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.312
I have a life. I
can't just leave.

22:34.336 --> 22:37.273
Look, I just... I just
thought it would be fun.

22:37.297 --> 22:39.224
You know? I just wanted
us to have a little fun.

22:40.884 --> 22:42.111
So why does that suddenly mean

22:42.135 --> 22:44.030
different things
than it used to?

22:44.054 --> 22:46.606
I don't...

22:48.767 --> 22:49.985
Look...

22:53.563 --> 22:55.240
The way we were before,

22:55.482 --> 22:57.961
there were parts of me
that you didn't know,

22:57.985 --> 23:00.421
and there are probably a lot of
parts of you that I didn't know,

23:00.445 --> 23:02.006
and the whole thing
of being together

23:02.030 --> 23:05.583
is, like, finding out
those other parts.

23:07.202 --> 23:08.586
And I don't know, I guess

23:09.538 --> 23:12.132
sometimes for me that
means being spontaneous.

23:13.542 --> 23:15.135
What's wrong with that?

23:17.963 --> 23:19.472
Nothing, I guess.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.267
So?

23:22.759 --> 23:26.072
So then let's just
relax a little, okay?

23:26.096 --> 23:27.355
And have some fun.

23:27.431 --> 23:29.065
I mean, isn't that the point?

23:29.891 --> 23:31.568
Yeah.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.653
- Yes?
- Yes.

23:35.731 --> 23:37.083
One, two, three,
two, two, three.

23:37.107 --> 23:39.293
Hear the beat, move with it.

23:39.317 --> 23:40.712
One, two, three,
two, two, three.

23:40.736 --> 23:41.713
Hear the beat...

23:41.737 --> 23:43.538
Very nice.

23:46.408 --> 23:48.386
Two, two, three...

23:48.410 --> 23:50.179
If your foot was where
it was supposed to be...

23:50.203 --> 23:51.556
How are we going?

23:51.580 --> 23:53.057
Why don't you find somebody
else to dance with

23:53.081 --> 23:54.225
if I'm such a bad partner.

23:54.249 --> 23:55.601
Kirsten?

23:55.625 --> 23:58.021
We feeling a little "My
way or the highway" here?

23:58.045 --> 23:59.512
Do you mind?

24:00.213 --> 24:03.651
Charlie, don't be an idiot.
I don't want somebody else.

24:03.675 --> 24:05.486
How about Rob? He was
probably a great dancer.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.488
- Who?
- Rob.

24:07.512 --> 24:10.783
The guy you were supposed
to marry Rob... Sausage.

24:10.807 --> 24:12.869
Rob Strapplemeyer
is a total pig.

24:12.893 --> 24:14.287
I haven't seen him
in four years.

24:14.311 --> 24:16.247
Well, maybe he's not
such a pig any more.

24:16.271 --> 24:18.458
Maybe now he's got a good
job and a fat bank account

24:18.482 --> 24:20.251
and friends with taste and...

24:20.275 --> 24:21.701
Rhythm?

24:24.196 --> 24:26.539
You know, I got a lot of work
to do at the restaurant.

24:35.332 --> 24:37.977
Hey, pal! Glass. Breakable.

24:38.001 --> 24:39.594
Think a little.

24:42.047 --> 24:43.608
If you're trying to
tell me something,

24:43.632 --> 24:46.476
I'd appreciate it if you'd
come right out and say it.

24:46.593 --> 24:47.528
Say what?

24:47.552 --> 24:50.313
Say why you're being
so elusive these days.

24:50.472 --> 24:51.949
Hard to track down.

24:51.973 --> 24:54.609
Griffin, I expected to see
you at the Atlas last night.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.829
Why? It wasn't Soul Asylum.

24:56.853 --> 24:59.040
Yeah, well, I didn't
know that, so I waited.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.751
And then I looked for
you today at school.

25:01.775 --> 25:03.002
Well, I cut.

25:03.026 --> 25:04.953
I do that sometimes.

25:05.987 --> 25:08.591
What the hell are you doing?

25:08.615 --> 25:10.635
I spent a thousand bucks
on those glasses.

25:10.659 --> 25:12.252
They're practically antiques.

25:12.577 --> 25:13.679
Well, they were.

25:13.703 --> 25:15.755
Just clean them up, Griffin.

25:19.876 --> 25:22.105
All right, pal. That's it.
You're fired.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.148
Why does everyone here
keep calling me "pal"?

25:24.172 --> 25:26.192
No, Charlie, wait.
It wasn't his fault.

25:26.216 --> 25:27.443
You know how wobbly
these shelves are.

25:27.467 --> 25:28.694
What are you doing?

25:28.718 --> 25:30.071
Nothing. I'm just
trying to help.

25:30.095 --> 25:31.531
Yeah, well, who asked you?

25:31.555 --> 25:34.023
The last time I checked, I
could take care of myself.

25:34.224 --> 25:36.119
Who asked you to get me a job
here in the first place?

25:36.143 --> 25:37.787
You complained about
getting fired.

25:37.811 --> 25:38.955
I thought...

25:38.979 --> 25:40.414
Here you'd be able
to keep tabs on me?

25:40.438 --> 25:41.582
No.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.501
Or I'd be less...
What's that word?

25:43.525 --> 25:44.627
- Elusive.
- Yeah.

25:44.651 --> 25:46.870
Elusive.

25:53.660 --> 25:56.337
Oh! No, no, Bailey. Watch.
I love this sequence.

25:56.705 --> 25:59.058
See, what Renoir does is
he shows them all killing

25:59.082 --> 26:01.759
with the same casualness as
they had in the foyer scene.

26:03.044 --> 26:04.647
And it's like the
rules of the game

26:04.671 --> 26:05.898
are there are no rules.

26:05.922 --> 26:07.942
I mean, nothing really
matters to these people.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.559
Bailey, come on. Stop.

26:09.718 --> 26:10.736
Look, see that guy right there?

26:10.760 --> 26:12.155
That's Renoir.
He's the director.

26:12.179 --> 26:13.322
See, he casts...

26:13.346 --> 26:14.824
You're not even
paying attention.

26:14.848 --> 26:16.242
I am. I am.

26:16.266 --> 26:18.244
You see, I can watch and listen

26:18.268 --> 26:20.037
and do this all
at the same time.

26:20.061 --> 26:20.997
Bailey!

26:21.021 --> 26:22.238
What?

26:26.151 --> 26:28.411
Hey, down in front!

26:31.489 --> 26:32.707
What's your problem?

26:33.158 --> 26:34.468
My problem?

26:34.492 --> 26:35.803
My problem?

26:35.827 --> 26:37.471
They were just shooting, Sarah.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.380
It's not like you missed
any of the dialogue. God.

26:40.165 --> 26:41.851
That is so not the
point, Bailey.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.519
That is so not the point.

26:43.543 --> 26:44.604
Then what is?

26:44.628 --> 26:46.022
That I can't do anything right?

26:46.046 --> 26:47.481
That everything I do is wrong?

26:47.505 --> 26:48.691
All I wanted to do

26:48.715 --> 26:51.152
was see a movie with you.
Okay, so maybe it's not

26:51.176 --> 26:53.362
the coolest movie or
the hippest movie,

26:53.386 --> 26:54.488
but I love it.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.157
And I wanted to show
you why I love it

26:56.181 --> 26:57.992
and maybe for you
to love it too.

26:58.016 --> 27:00.494
I mean, I really wanted
to share that with you.

27:00.518 --> 27:04.040
But what I don't get is why what
I want doesn't matter anymore,

27:04.064 --> 27:06.042
because when we were
friends, it used to.

27:06.066 --> 27:07.793
But now you're just
like every other guy.

27:07.817 --> 27:10.254
Any dark room is a good
place to fool around,

27:10.278 --> 27:12.089
any theater or park
or football field.

27:12.113 --> 27:13.623
That is not what I'm like.

27:13.949 --> 27:15.301
Look, if you don't
wanna do this stuff...

27:15.325 --> 27:18.137
No, I do. I really do.

27:18.161 --> 27:19.379
But...

27:19.746 --> 27:21.047
Not like this.

27:22.499 --> 27:24.977
Well, then maybe you should
tell me what you had in mind

27:25.001 --> 27:27.011
because I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.139
I don't. This seems fine to me.

27:32.092 --> 27:35.395
I just wouldn't mind feeling
like it's a little special.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.616
You know, not another thing
that we do in the movie theater

27:38.640 --> 27:40.316
like getting popcorn.

27:40.725 --> 27:43.621
It's not popcorn, Bailey.

27:43.645 --> 27:45.280
You know, I mean, it's special.

27:47.232 --> 27:50.326
You know, it... It
should be special.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.015
Midnight's a good time for that.

28:12.424 --> 28:14.309
Gotta get it done sometime.

28:17.595 --> 28:19.188
Is Kirsten here?

28:19.264 --> 28:20.648
Yeah.

28:21.057 --> 28:23.610
She came home, grabbed a
beer and stormed upstairs.

28:25.020 --> 28:28.114
You guys sure make being
engaged look romantic.

28:30.859 --> 28:32.660
I wish I knew how this happens.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.579
What?

28:36.406 --> 28:38.718
Just tiny things...
that mean nothing

28:38.742 --> 28:40.877
suddenly mean everything.

28:41.494 --> 28:42.837
Like...?

28:44.789 --> 28:46.341
Like dancing.

28:47.542 --> 28:48.760
I can't dance.

28:50.420 --> 28:53.681
I mean, we all know this.
This is not news.

28:54.299 --> 28:57.310
So why is it suddenly
such a big deal?

29:02.223 --> 29:07.163
Well, because every girl,
even the smart ones,

29:07.187 --> 29:08.581
thinks how great it would be

29:08.605 --> 29:10.990
to dance with her husband
at their wedding.

29:11.941 --> 29:13.502
It's dumb, probably,

29:13.526 --> 29:15.880
but it's kind of like there's
this tiny part of you

29:15.904 --> 29:18.090
that believes that as soon
as you start to waltz,

29:18.114 --> 29:20.092
this nice voice

29:20.116 --> 29:22.011
that knows exactly what
it's talking about

29:22.035 --> 29:24.305
will come out of
nowhere and say,

29:24.329 --> 29:26.798
"And they lived
happily ever after."

29:27.624 --> 29:29.217
Great.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.931
I can show you, if you want.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.702
Just watch my feet and
mirror what I do.

29:46.726 --> 29:49.163
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.540
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

29:51.564 --> 29:54.335
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

29:54.359 --> 29:56.035
You've got it!

29:56.695 --> 29:58.871
See? No problem.

30:01.991 --> 30:03.386
And if you loosen your grip,

30:03.410 --> 30:05.096
I'll get some blood
back in my fingers,

30:05.120 --> 30:06.504
and that'd be good too.

30:12.043 --> 30:15.263
Dad taught me how to waltz
by standing me on his feet.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.852
Does Griffin know
how well you dance?

30:23.638 --> 30:25.064
He should, Jule.

30:25.348 --> 30:28.359
It should matter to him
because it matters to you.

30:28.476 --> 30:30.319
You deserve that.

30:35.191 --> 30:37.461
You can twirl me if you want.

30:37.485 --> 30:39.964
Just put your arm
up, and I'll spin.

30:39.988 --> 30:41.581
Okay.

31:03.344 --> 31:05.698
I'm not following you.
I'm going to my locker.

31:05.722 --> 31:07.408
I know where your locker is.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.118
Wow. You must really care.

31:09.142 --> 31:10.818
Look, what do you want from me?

31:12.645 --> 31:13.539
You know,

31:13.563 --> 31:16.365
you have all these ideas of
what you want a guy to do

31:16.399 --> 31:17.752
and think and all.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.086
I mean, I just do what I do.

31:19.110 --> 31:22.298
I know. You don't answer
to anyone or anything.

31:22.322 --> 31:23.466
Good for you.

31:23.490 --> 31:25.092
You knew who I was when
you got into this.

31:25.116 --> 31:26.302
Yeah, but at least...

31:26.326 --> 31:27.752
I mean,

31:28.787 --> 31:31.015
I don't even know why
we're together at all.

31:31.039 --> 31:33.476
I mean, I have no idea
what you think of me

31:33.500 --> 31:35.760
or feel or anything.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.304
It's not like you ever
come over or call.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.640
Or even say my name.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.818
Do you know that?

31:42.842 --> 31:44.236
In four months,

31:44.260 --> 31:47.772
you have never once
called me by my name.

31:48.223 --> 31:49.575
Every time I see you,

31:49.599 --> 31:51.368
I think, "This time
he's gonna say it,"

31:51.392 --> 31:52.735
but you never do.

31:54.145 --> 31:55.956
The closest you came was
one day in the park.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.949
You said, "Hey, you."

31:58.817 --> 32:00.118
"You."

32:00.693 --> 32:03.746
"You" could be anyone, Griffin.
I have a name.

32:05.573 --> 32:09.127
Well, maybe it doesn't matter
to you what my name is.

32:10.245 --> 32:11.838
That's really too bad.

32:26.386 --> 32:27.822
You know, Claud,
when a doctor says

32:27.846 --> 32:29.907
there's a 98-percent
chance that you're fine,

32:29.931 --> 32:32.024
that's good news.

32:34.477 --> 32:35.496
So, what's up?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.321
What's the problem?

32:38.398 --> 32:40.491
What if it's that two percent?

32:40.733 --> 32:42.962
It won't be. That's
what two percent means.

32:42.986 --> 32:45.121
No, that's what
zero percent means.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.423
Two percent means

32:46.447 --> 32:48.958
maybe I'll never get to
play in Carnegie Hall.

32:49.367 --> 32:50.886
Listen, Claud,

32:50.910 --> 32:54.213
the odds that you can't are
really, really remote.

32:54.914 --> 32:57.268
But if that did happen,

32:57.292 --> 33:00.219
if you couldn't play
like before, we'd...

33:00.545 --> 33:02.680
We'd deal with it.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.684
We would.

33:07.552 --> 33:10.396
Wanna know something really
bad about me, Charlie?

33:10.805 --> 33:12.106
Yeah.

33:12.348 --> 33:14.442
It's really bad.

33:14.475 --> 33:16.611
I can take it.

33:16.936 --> 33:18.487
Okay.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.709
My favorite thing
in the whole world

33:21.733 --> 33:23.534
is to go to a master class.

33:23.943 --> 33:25.629
Because you see, well,
at these classes,

33:25.653 --> 33:27.997
everyone thinks that,
"Oh, they're the best."

33:28.031 --> 33:29.582
But you know what?

33:29.616 --> 33:32.052
They're not, not ever,

33:32.076 --> 33:35.055
because every time I've
been to a master class,

33:35.079 --> 33:37.632
I've been the best one there.

33:37.874 --> 33:39.759
Every time.

33:40.668 --> 33:43.846
I like being the best, Charlie.

33:45.798 --> 33:48.351
I like it a lot.

33:52.472 --> 33:55.066
Look, I'm the last person
to tell you he's perfect.

33:55.224 --> 33:57.735
I mean, this is Bailey
we're talking about.

33:58.895 --> 34:00.998
I'm just saying,

34:01.022 --> 34:03.208
you knew it would be different.

34:03.232 --> 34:04.617
Yeah, you know, I know. I know.

34:04.734 --> 34:07.296
I guess I kind of expected
things to change.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.005
I just didn't expect him to.

34:09.030 --> 34:11.967
I mean, I'd like to go out
with Bailey, not James Dean.

34:11.991 --> 34:13.960
James Dean!

34:14.369 --> 34:15.346
It's weird,

34:15.370 --> 34:16.429
but it's like all of a sudden

34:16.454 --> 34:18.264
all he wants to do is
kind of skip school

34:18.289 --> 34:19.934
and be rebels or something.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.810
You know, take off in
the middle of the week,

34:21.833 --> 34:24.262
who knows where for no reason.

34:24.462 --> 34:25.898
It was okay for a while,

34:25.922 --> 34:27.348
but...

34:28.132 --> 34:30.810
I don't know, now it's like he's
acting like he's someone else.

34:32.219 --> 34:34.322
Or maybe...

34:34.347 --> 34:36.440
like you are.

34:57.245 --> 34:59.682
So help me with the math here.

34:59.706 --> 35:02.142
Exactly how many martinis will
each customer have to drink

35:02.166 --> 35:03.268
to pay for these coats?

35:03.292 --> 35:04.645
Eighty?

35:04.669 --> 35:06.814
You don't want it to take
off on the first night.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.139
You want it to build slowly.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.767
How slowly?

35:13.845 --> 35:15.938
Here we go.

35:20.518 --> 35:21.694
I can't take this.

35:22.687 --> 35:23.831
Hey.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.290
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, well...

35:25.314 --> 35:27.292
Look, I've been thinking a lot

35:27.316 --> 35:29.420
about some of the
stuff you were saying

35:29.444 --> 35:31.505
about how we've been,
about how I've been.

35:31.529 --> 35:34.591
And... I think you were right.

35:34.615 --> 35:36.667
I think that I haven't been
paying attention to you...

35:36.951 --> 35:38.095
Stop.

35:38.119 --> 35:39.378
What?

35:39.579 --> 35:41.005
Don't.

35:42.081 --> 35:43.809
'Cause you can't really
pay attention to someone

35:43.833 --> 35:45.634
when you're wishing
she's someone else.

35:47.670 --> 35:49.221
Excuse me?

35:51.090 --> 35:54.477
I'm not her, Bailey.
I'm not Jill.

36:06.064 --> 36:07.907
What are you talking about?

36:08.191 --> 36:10.210
Well, that's what
you've been doing here.

36:10.234 --> 36:13.996
You've been trying to have the
relationship you had with her with me.

36:14.030 --> 36:15.623
What?

36:15.698 --> 36:18.084
The road trip, cutting school...

36:18.493 --> 36:21.013
I mean, all that stuff has
nothing to do with me at all.

36:21.037 --> 36:23.932
It's just stuff that you
did with her, you know?

36:23.956 --> 36:26.133
It's Jill stuff.

36:30.129 --> 36:31.940
I don't know. I don't know.

36:31.964 --> 36:33.557
Maybe...

36:33.841 --> 36:37.269
Maybe I thought that you
would like that stuff too.

36:38.721 --> 36:41.232
You know what
really confuses me?

36:42.350 --> 36:45.152
Is that relationship
wasn't good, Bailey.

36:45.561 --> 36:47.081
I mean, she was a mess.

36:47.105 --> 36:48.781
You were unhappy.

36:49.482 --> 36:52.660
You know, and it
ended so, so badly.

36:54.570 --> 36:57.415
So I don't get why you'd choose
that over being happy with me.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.793
I... I really don't see
why that's appealing.

37:05.289 --> 37:07.216
Sarah...

37:07.792 --> 37:09.885
I'm sorry.

37:12.130 --> 37:14.432
- I don't know...
- Hey, it's okay.

37:15.675 --> 37:17.101
It is.

37:20.721 --> 37:24.567
I just don't think stuff, you
know, should be this hard.

37:26.060 --> 37:29.238
I mean, look at us.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.866
It's brand-new, and already
it's so difficult.

37:34.402 --> 37:35.379
So...

37:35.403 --> 37:38.205
we should just... not.

37:40.283 --> 37:43.011
Because you're great,

37:43.035 --> 37:45.337
but you're not ready.

37:46.622 --> 37:48.299
That's too bad.

37:54.297 --> 37:55.691
Wow.

37:55.715 --> 37:57.725
This place looks really cool.

37:58.509 --> 38:00.895
Tell Charlie I said so, okay?

38:16.527 --> 38:19.923
This band cost me 500 bucks.
Someone's gotta dance to it.

38:19.947 --> 38:21.884
I'm not in the mood.

38:21.908 --> 38:25.711
In the mood, but are you sure?

38:49.977 --> 38:52.164
I'm feeling a little

38:52.188 --> 38:55.125
"Don't you dare try and tell me
I can't dance, you so-and-so,"

38:55.149 --> 38:56.408
aren't I?

38:56.442 --> 38:59.838
Yeah, well, I decided to make
a few changes in my life.

38:59.862 --> 39:02.132
Ever since I had my cereal read.

39:02.156 --> 39:03.258
Your what?

39:03.282 --> 39:05.052
My breakfast cereal.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.845
It's the new wave
in fortunetelling,

39:06.869 --> 39:08.931
you know, reading
the gooshy gunk

39:08.955 --> 39:10.548
at the bottom of
your cereal bowl.

39:11.832 --> 39:13.101
I hadn't heard.

39:13.125 --> 39:17.272
Yeah. Very scientific. I
got some clear images.

39:17.296 --> 39:19.274
One of good ol' Rob

39:19.298 --> 39:21.109
sitting there in his
athleisure wear

39:21.133 --> 39:23.269
with his beer gut pressing
the remote control.

39:24.136 --> 39:25.688
I know. I'm so sorry.

39:27.473 --> 39:29.409
And then I saw another image,

39:29.433 --> 39:31.318
this one at the wedding.

39:32.061 --> 39:36.750
You look beautiful. I
look not half-bad too.

39:36.774 --> 39:39.127
Everyone around us is
watching us dance,

39:39.151 --> 39:40.712
and they're saying,

39:40.736 --> 39:42.172
"Look at them.

39:42.196 --> 39:44.216
They're perfect together.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.927
I bet they live
happily ever after."

39:46.951 --> 39:50.514
I thought you didn't believe
in all that mumbo jumbo.

39:50.538 --> 39:52.965
Gotta believe in
something, right?

39:53.708 --> 39:55.551
Right.

39:59.922 --> 40:01.108
Try a spin?

40:01.132 --> 40:03.892
Jesus! I'm sorry!

40:07.722 --> 40:10.367
You wanna dance?

40:10.391 --> 40:12.860
I'm not in the mood.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.030
You know what?

40:16.772 --> 40:18.824
Neither am I.

41:11.952 --> 41:13.337
You workin' or something?

41:13.579 --> 41:15.182
Just helping.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.425
Your replacement
isn't working out.

41:23.297 --> 41:24.932
What are you doing here?

41:26.133 --> 41:29.353
I just thought I
might run into you.

41:29.387 --> 41:31.230
Maybe we could hang out.

41:31.389 --> 41:34.274
You probably think that's a
nice thing to say, don't you?

41:35.101 --> 41:36.819
Well, it's not.

41:37.353 --> 41:40.999
A nice thing to say is, "I
was thinking about you,"

41:41.023 --> 41:43.335
or, "I really wanna see you."

41:43.359 --> 41:45.879
Hey, I don't talk
like that, okay?

41:45.903 --> 41:47.297
I mean...

41:47.321 --> 41:48.340
I'm not... I'm not like that.

41:48.364 --> 41:49.998
Yeah.

41:50.616 --> 41:51.760
Well, I am.

41:51.784 --> 41:54.002
I got this for you.

41:55.663 --> 41:57.182
I didn't really lose mine.

41:57.206 --> 41:59.049
I...

41:59.208 --> 42:02.354
I just thought I should
probably have another one

42:02.378 --> 42:06.140
since... maybe you'd be
riding with me some.

42:10.594 --> 42:12.354
So...

42:14.098 --> 42:15.649
This is for you...

42:19.895 --> 42:21.488
Julia.
